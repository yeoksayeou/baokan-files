　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 2nd: Moscow Dispatch: Moscow newspapers all published editorials on the 30th commemorating the fourteenth anniversary of the Stakhanovite Movement. The "Pravda" editorial stated: The truly national-scale mass socialist competition in the Soviet Union most vividly demonstrates the Soviet people's new attitude towards labor and new perspective on work. In this great movement, they continue to put forward various new forms of initiatives, arousing the people's infinite creative energy to consolidate the strength of the Soviet socialist state.
    "Pravda" further pointed out: The most important characteristic of the current stage of socialist competition is its mass character and its unprecedentedly broad scale. More than ninety percent of workers, engineers, technicians, staff members, and the vast majority of collective farmers have participated in the competition. Another characteristic of the current stage of socialist competition is that mass creative initiatives aim not only to exceed the plan in terms of quantity, but also to improve quality, discovering and providing ever-changing inherent potential for the Five-Year Plan.
    "Pravda" pointed out: The broad scope and achievements of socialist competition reflect the enriched intellectual wealth of the Soviet people, as well as the new moral qualities of the Soviet people cultivated by the Lenin-Stalin Party. "Pravda" concluded: Socialist competition has proven its unstoppable strength in the Soviet Union, and now it is proving its strength in the people's democratic countries that have already embarked on the road of socialist construction.

　　斯塔哈诺夫运动十四周年
  　真理报发表社论纪念
    【新华社北平二日电】莫斯科讯：莫斯科各报三十日均发表社论，纪念斯塔哈诺夫运动十四周年。真理报社论写道：苏联真正全国规模的群众性的社会主义竞赛，最生动地表现了苏联人民对劳动的新态度和对工作的新观点。他们在这个伟大的运动里继续不断地提出各种新形式的倡议，唤起人民无穷尽的创造精力，来巩固苏维埃社会主义国家的力量。
    真理报进一步指出：现阶段社会主义竞赛最重要的特点，就是它的群众性，它的空前广泛的规模。百分之九十以上的工人、工程师、技师、职员和绝大多数的集体农民都参加了竞赛。现阶段社会主义竞赛的另一个特点是：群众性的创造性倡议，其目的不但求在量的方面超过计划，并且求质的改进，给五年计划发现了并提供了日新月异的内在潜力。
    真理报指出：社会主义竞赛广泛的范围及其成就，反映着苏联人民丰富了的智力财富，以及列宁斯大林党所培养出来的苏联人民的新道德品质。真理报最后说：社会主义竞赛在苏联证明了其势不可当的力量，现在，它并正在已经走上建设社会主义道路的人民民主国家证明着它的力量。
