　　The Battle of Sanguankou on Liupan Mountain
  　—Opening a Gap to Lanzhou and Ningxia—
  　Inspiring Every Soldier to Fight Bravely
    Chairman Mao's magnificent lines:
    On Liupan Mountain's summit high,
    Red flags ripple in the west wind's sigh,
    Today the long cord is in hand,
    When shall we bind the gray dragon grand?

    In late July, the People's Liberation Army, advancing along the Xi'an-Lanzhou Highway towards eastern Gansu, engaged in a long-distance pursuit and annihilation campaign against the bandit troops of the "Two Ma's" with heroic spirit. After our army liberated Pingliang, the Ningxia Ma Bufang bandit troops, in their retreat westward, attempted to use the treacherous Sanguankou pass in front of Liupan Mountain to block the rapid advance of our army heading west and north, giving the fleeing bandits some time to prolong their existence. However, our vanguard units, closely following and pursuing relentlessly, annihilated the enemy and occupied Sanguankou in a very short time, demonstrating a spirit of not fearing fatigue and continuous combat.
    Sanguankou, near Liupan Mountain, is a strategic pass located at the junction of the Xi'an-Lanzhou and Pingliang-Ningxia highways. It is flanked by high peaks and cliffs on the north and south, with only a narrow path passable from east to west. The Ma bandit cavalry's 37th Regiment guarded the southern mountain, the 767th Regiment of the 256th Division guarded Taibai Mountain to the north, and a company was stationed at the pass itself.
    A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army arrived at the foot of Liupan Mountain during its advance into Gansu. This reminded them of the historic feat of the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army's Long March northward through this area more than a decade ago to advance east to resist Japan. Chairman Mao's magnificent lines from his Long March poem, "On Liupan Mountain's summit high, Red flags ripple in the west wind's sigh, Today the long cord is in hand, When shall we bind the gray dragon grand?" further inspired the soaring determination of every commander and fighter to annihilate the enemy, encouraging them to advance bravely. The battle to capture Sanguankou began on July 31st, with our army launching attacks on the enemy on the southern mountain and Taibai Mountain to the north in four directions. Under the iron fists of our brave and skilled People's Liberation Army, the Ma bandits on the southern mountain were smashed to pieces, and the Liberation Army quickly captured the position.
    A certain regiment, attacking Taibai Mountain, launched a multi-pronged flanking assault up the mountain. Zhao Jieqing, the squad leader of the fourth squad of the eighth company, led his entire squad around steep cliffs and annihilated an enemy squad while they were still sound asleep, capturing several hilltops in front of the main position on Taibai Mountain. At dawn on August 1st, our army began its attack on the main position of Taibai Mountain. Li Jinzhao, the deputy company commander of the seventh company of a certain regiment, led a platoon just as they broke through onto the mountain when thirty or so enemies rushed out from the opposite mountain. In a close-quarters combat, our soldiers immediately jumped into their positions and unleashed a barrage of fire on the enemy. Soldier Chen Chuandao stepped forward and engaged an enemy in a bayonet fight in the narrow trench. The enemy stabbed him in the face, and blood flowed, but at this moment, this son of the people did not forget the mission of resolutely annihilating the enemy. He roared, shaking the mountains, "I'll show you how red my bayonet is!" and bravely thrust his bayonet through the enemy's chest. Communist Party member Xie Chunhe fought another enemy, and when he was about to take out a grenade for a final blow, he was unexpectedly stabbed by the enemy, suffering severe injuries to his head and shoulder, and fell to the ground. However, when the enemy attempted to pounce on him again, he still took out the grenade. The grenade exploded between himself and the enemy, the enemy was annihilated, and Comrade Xie Chunhe shed his last drop of blood for the people's motherland. The deputy squad leader of the machine gun squad encountered several enemy counterattacks during the assault, but due to his brave and calm spirit in the face of danger and his skillful use of firearms, the enemies were knocked down one by one.
    In this way, under the command of the deputy company commander, the people's soldiers resolutely eliminated all enemies who dared to resist, captured Taibai Mountain, and annihilated the enemy at the pass in one fell swoop, completely capturing Sanguankou, opening a gap to Lanzhou and Ningxia, and creating favorable conditions for subsequent brother units to advance into Liupan Mountain and liberate the Great Northwest.

　　六盘山三关口之战
  　—打开通向兰州、宁夏的缺口—
  　鼓舞着每个战士奋勇前进
    毛主席的壮伟诗句：
    六盘山上高峰，
    红旗漫卷西风，
    今日长缨在手，
    何时缚住苍龙。
　　        
    七月下旬，沿西兰公路向陇东挺进的人民解放军以猛打猛追的英雄气概，向二马匪军进行了长距离的追剿战。我军解放平凉后，向西溃逃的宁夏马步芳匪军企图凭借六盘山前的三关口险要关隘，阻挡西指北征我军的急进，让狼狈逃窜的匪徒们得到一些苟延残喘的时间。但是我军紧跟穷追的先头部队，却以不顾疲劳，连续作战的精神，在极短的时间内，歼灭了敌人，占领了三关口。
    三关口在六盘山的跟前，是个险要的关口，地处西安至兰州和平凉至宁夏的两条公路的联结要冲，南北两面皆是高峰峭壁，东西仅有一条狭道可通。马匪骑兵三十七团把守着南山，二五六师的七六七团把守着北面的太白山，正面的关口也驻守了一个连。
    解放军某部在向甘肃进军中到达了六盘山下。这使他们回忆起十多年前工农红军长征北上经过这一地区东进抗日的历史壮举。毛主席长征辞中“六盘山上高峰，红旗漫卷西风，今日长缨在手，何时缚住苍龙”的壮伟诗句，益加激动着每个指战员们高涨的歼敌决心，鼓舞着他们奋勇前进。七月三十一日，攻取三关口的战斗开始了，我军分四路向南山及北面太白山的敌人发起攻击。在我英勇善战的解放军铁拳下，南山的马匪被锤击得稀烂，解放军很快地攻占了这一阵地。
    向太白山进攻的某团，分几路迂回向山上突攻。八连四班长赵捷庆带领全班绕过陡山峭壁，还在敌人昏头大睡中就一举歼灭敌人一个班，攻占了太白山主要阵地前的几个山头。八月一日拂晓，我军向太白山主要阵地开始攻击，某团七连副连长李金昭带着一个排刚刚突击上山，对面山上就冲过来三十几个敌人，两下短兵相逢，我们战士们马上跃进阵地，向敌人密集扫射。战士陈传道抢前一步，在狭窄的交通壕里和敌人拼起刺刀来。敌人刺破了他的脸，鲜血在流着，然而这位人民的子弟兵在这个时候却丝毫也没有忘记坚决歼敌的任务，他震彻山野的大吼一声：“叫你看我的刺刀红不红”，端起刺枪来勇猛的刺透了敌人的胸膛。共产党员谢春和同另外一个敌人搏斗，当他预备拿出手榴弹给匪徒最后一击的时候，却不意让敌人先刺了一刀，头部和肩部都受了重伤，倒在地上，但是在敌人企图再度猛扑上来的时候，他仍然拿出了手榴弹。手榴弹在自己和敌人中间爆炸了，敌人被消灭了，谢春和同志也为人民祖国洒尽了最后一滴血。机枪班副班长在突击冲锋中几次遇到匪徒们的反扑，但是由于他临阵英勇镇静的精神和运用自如而又灵活的枪法，敌人被一个一个地击倒了。
    就这样，人民的战士们在该连副连长的指挥下，坚决消灭了敢于抵抗的一切敌人，攻占了太白山，并一举而歼灭了关口的敌人，全部攻占了三关口，打开了通向兰州和通向宁夏的缺口，给后续兄弟部队挺进六盘山解放大西北创造了一个便利的条件。
