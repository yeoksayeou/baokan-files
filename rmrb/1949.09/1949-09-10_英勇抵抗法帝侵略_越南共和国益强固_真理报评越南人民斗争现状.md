Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 9th: TASS, Moscow, September 7th: *Pravda* published an article by Mayevsky entitled "The Vietnamese People's Struggle for Freedom and Independence." Mayevsky wrote: World democratic public opinion deeply sympathizes with the heroic national liberation struggle of the Vietnamese people. French troops—an army of 140,000 men, augmented by German and Italian war criminals recruited and equipped with artillery, tanks, and aircraft—have been driven to attack the Vietnamese people. The cruelty of the interventionists is reminiscent of the bloody crimes of the Hitlerite barbarian gangs. The aggressors destroy peaceful homes, shoot and hang peaceful residents, and burn children alive. And all this is done under the pretext of "France's civilizing mission in Vietnam"! American and British imperialists are active participants in this shameful "mission," supplying weapons to the French colonialists and encouraging them in their political gambling. American expansionists pay particular attention to the fate of Vietnam and the entire Indochina. Wall Street tycoons consider France's intervention in this young democratic republic an integral part of America's Pacific plan. The center of these plans is the so-called Pacific Union planned by the United States. According to the ideas of US imperialism, the strategic positions of the Pacific group, which serves as the spearhead against the national liberation movement of the Asian people, will run through Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, Siam, and India. Democratic Vietnam is right in the center of this position. The author pointed out that all attempts by the French imperialists and their American accomplices to conquer the freedom-loving Vietnamese people have failed. The masses who rose up to defend their republic inflicted serious blows on the enslavers. More than 90% of the land with a population of 20 million is under the control of the government of the Republic of Vietnam. Under the leadership of the Viet Minh (an alliance of various democratic parties and groups headed by Ho Chi Minh, an outstanding fighter for Vietnam's freedom and independence), the Republic of Vietnam has implemented profound democratic reforms and drawn strength from these democratic reforms.
	In a short period of time, the Republic established a democratic army tempered in the struggle against the enemy. Vietnam, artificially divided into three parts by the French colonialists, has been reunified into one country.
	The Vietnamese people have achieved great successes in the development of agriculture and industry and the stabilization of finance. The threat of starvation has been eradicated. Farmers have satisfied the rice needs of the army and the people, and workers have supplied the army with ammunition.
	Mayevsky concluded: The moral support of the world's democratic forces has inspired the Vietnamese people to continue their struggle against foreign enslavers and for the freedom and independence of their motherland. No vicious conspiracy of international imperialist reactionaries can break the will of a people who sincerely yearn for the freedom and independence of their motherland.

　  越南共和国益强固
  　真理报评越南人民斗争现状
    【新华社北平九日电】塔斯社莫斯科七日讯：真理报刊载马耶夫斯基所著一文，题为“越南人民争取自由与独立的斗争”。马耶夫斯基写道：全世界民主舆论对于越南人民英勇的民族解放斗争，寄予深切的同情。为征募来的德意战犯所增援的，用大炮、坦克及飞机装备着的法国军队——一支十四万人的军队，被驱使来进攻越南人民。干涉分子的残酷，令人想起希特勒野蛮匪帮的血腥罪行。侵略者毁坏和平住宅，枪毙与绞杀和平居民，活生生地烧死小孩。而所有这些，却都是在“法国在越南的文明使命”的口实下作出来的！美英帝国主义者则是这种可耻的“使命”的积极参加者，它们供给法国殖民者武器，并在法国殖民者的政治赌赙中鼓励他们。美国扩张主义者对于越南及整个外印度支那的命运，表示特别注意。华尔街的大亨们认为法国对这个年青的民主共和国的干涉，是美国太平洋计划的不可分割的一部分。这些计划的中心，乃是美国所策划的所谓太平洋联盟。根据美帝国主义的想法，充作反对亚洲人民民族解放运动矛头的太平洋集团的战略阵地，将贯穿日本、南朝鲜、菲律宾、暹罗及印度。民主越南恰恰处在这一阵地的中心。作者指出，法帝国主义者及其美国帮凶想征服爱好自由的越南人民的一切企图，都落空了。起来保卫自己共和国的群众，对奴役者给了严重打击。拥有两千万人口的百分之九十以上的国土，在越南共和国政府的控制之下。越南共和国在越盟（以争取越南的自由与独立的杰出战士胡志明为首的各民主党派与团体的联盟）的领导下，实行了深入的民主改革，并从这种民主改革中取得了力量。
    共和国在短短的时期内，建立了在对敌斗争中饱经锻炼的民主军。被法国殖民者人工地分割成三个圻的越南，已重新统一在一个国家之内。
    越南人民在农业、工业的发展及金融的稳定等方面，都获得了巨大成就。饥饿的威胁根除了，农民已满足了军队与人民的食米需要，工人为军队供给军火。
    马耶夫斯基结语称：全世界民主力量在道义上的支援，鼓舞了越南人民继续进行反对外国奴役者和争取祖国自由与独立的斗争。任何国际帝国主义反动派的恶毒阴谋，都不能打破衷心响往其祖国的自由与独立的人民的意志。
