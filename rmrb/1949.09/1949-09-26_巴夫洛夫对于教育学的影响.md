　　Pavlov's Influence on Education
　　Chen Yousong
　　Pavlov was a leading figure in physiological psychology who was awarded the Nobel Prize. Because of his revolutionary discoveries in psychology, he has also had a revolutionary impact on education. According to Lenin's definition of "mind," the mind is "a product of highly organized matter." The mind is a reflection of the material world. The human body is part of the material world and falls within the realm of physiology. Physiology is a necessary foundation for psychology. Psychology is one of the major foundations of education. The Soviet education scholar Pinkevich, when elaborating on Soviet education theory, based it partly on Pavlov's psychology and that of his school. His "New Education in the Soviet Republics" devoted one-eighth of its space to discussing the implications of this school of objective psychology for education. Pavlov's influence has spread worldwide. The United States, known in the world for its capitalist educational science, has also been greatly influenced by Pavlov. However, since 1924, due to class oppression, there has been no significant progress.
　　How has Pavlov's theory influenced education? It originated from his unprecedented experimental discovery in 1901, which was "conditioned reflex." The original translation, "alternating reflex," is somewhat inappropriate. Space does not allow for a detailed explanation of the specifics. Briefly, taking the example of ringing a bell and feeding a dog to make it salivate, then ringing the bell without feeding it but still causing salivation, a stimulus "A" that was originally insufficient to cause a certain reaction or reflex "C1" can be combined with another stimulus "B" that is sufficient to cause this reaction, occurring simultaneously once or more, and then become a stimulus "A2" that is sufficient to cause this reaction "C2." A2 is called the conditioned stimulus, and B is called the unconditioned stimulus. C2 is called the conditioned response or reflex. The entire process of stimulus and response is mediated through the nervous system. All human psychological states can be explained by reflexes (see Pavlov's "Normal and General Structure of Brain Activity"). The old instinct theory and emotions are nothing more than complex reflex clusters. Thought is the most complex inhibited reflex cluster (see Pavlov's "Objective Study of Higher Nervous Activity of Animals" and Bekhterev's "Reflexology," which develops this theory). All human learning and behavior can be explained by conditioned reflexes. The changes in an organism from birth to maturity are nothing more than a complex and intricate set of conditioned reflexes. "By nature, men are nearly alike; by practice, they get to be wide apart." This saying becomes even clearer with Pavlov. Conditioned reflexes have become a scientific key to transforming human behavior, transforming learning, and transforming education.
　　It is said that in the past forty years or so, there have been no fewer than 1,500 individual experiments on conditioned reflexes in various countries, applied successively to the study of children, the study of nervous diseases, and the study of various types of learning. For example, memorizing poems and prose, avoiding infectious diseases, discovering racial prejudice, learning foreign languages and typing, and studying emotions; for example, the reasons for fear of darkness, love of certain music, how certain dislikes or prejudices and attitudes come about, etc. Because Pavlov's theory is consistent with Marxism, it has been particularly developed in the Soviet Union. First, there was the above-mentioned Bekhterev's Reflexology, Kornilov's Reactology, and Blonsky's Scientific Psychology, which have already formed a relatively complete system. Mr. Guo Yicen of our country once translated and introduced them (see the Chinese edition of "Emerging Soviet Psychology"). In Germany, there were Münsterberg, Lehmann, and others; in the United States, there were Thorndike's connectionism and Watson's behaviorism, etc. Thorndike had a great influence on educational testing and teaching methods, especially arithmetic teaching methods. His works became famous long after 1901, just when the translation of Bekhterev's "Objective Psychology" was published in the United States in 1913, Thorndike became very famous. From a temporal perspective, it cannot be without Pavlov's influence. However, Thorndike's association of ideas was too subjective, while Pavlov's conditioning, regardless of subjective ideas and images, objectively and accurately measured stimuli and responses, establishing a solid principle of quantity. It even provided sociology and biology with provable assumptions. Watson's behaviorism in the United States was once very popular, and its content was entirely based on Pavlov's theory. He wrote "Behaviorism" and "Psychological Care of Infant and Child," which Guo Renyuan introduced in our country. In addition, in the United States, Alport's "Social Psychology," Burnham's "The Normal Mind," Shaffer's "Adjustment Psychology," and Guthrie's "The Psychology of Human Conflict" adopted Pavlov's theory, and they are very famous works. In the United States, those who adopt Pavlov's position and are recognized by psychologists as Pavlovian include Sandiford's "Educational Psychology: An Objective Study" (Longman Publishing Company edition, 1929, Peking University has this book).
　　Pavlov did pioneering work, and from the viewpoint of dialectical materialism, opened up a new realm for psychology. It is like exploring the poles. Previously, some people thought it was impossible, but now it is possible. Natural science is an example. Pavlov's distance to psychology is like, if humanity wants to explore the starry sky, people will say it is impossible. In psychology, Americans were also somewhat discouraged in this way (see "Modern Education Encyclopedia," page 631). Pavlov affirmatively and resolutely said: "There will come a time, even if it is still far away, when, based on the methods of natural science and mathematical analysis, a magnificent formula will encompass all balancing factors, ultimately including mankind itself." He also said, "On the great road entered by the pure physiology of the animal brain, science is awaiting the discovery of the nervous system, with the same astonishing and powerful achievements as those of natural science." We in the educational field are waiting for these discoveries. However, at present, from Pavlov's existing discoveries, he has already caused a major revolution in educational thought. The main points can be summarized in five aspects: (1) Human transformation and education have become highly possible. Conditioned reflexes have further shattered the superstition of heredity. They have transformed our narrow views on human personality and aptitude, etc. (see Watson's bold statements), and it is possible to create a new generation. The new people of New Democracy, socialism, and communism can be realized, and the intellectual emancipation of the proletariat has a basis. Because there is no innate ignorance. (2) It also makes us break away from subjectivism in education, transforms learning methods, and the key to learning lies in controlling appropriate stimuli to elicit appropriate responses. We have scientific methods for the formation and breaking of our habits, or rather, we should say that we at least want to use scientific methods, and the emphasis of an educational academic institution should be clear. (3) It clarifies the enormous role of the social environment, especially the economic environment, in education. Conditioned reflexes provide scientific proof and indicate the ways to arrange the learning environment. (4) The importance of physical and health education, the great importance of preschool education and nurseries, and adult education are even more possible. Endocrinology, nutrition, etc., have become powerful tools in the hands of educators. Medicine can shift towards preventive development, and cooperation between medicine and education has become a new trend. In teaching materials and methods, special attention is paid to the conditioning effects of mass life, especially the conditioning of emotions and will. Great personality and lofty ideals can be cultivated. The content of teaching materials emphasizes activities and behavior. Because teaching materials are units of behavior and experience. In Pavlov's words, they are the composition of conditioned reflexes.

　　巴夫洛夫对于教育学的影响
    陈友松
    巴夫洛夫是一位荣膺诺贝耳国际奖金的生理心理学的泰斗。因为他在心理学有革命性的发现，所以对教育学也有革命性的影响。依照列宁对“心”的定义，心是“有高度组织之物质的产物”。心是物质世界的反映。人体是物质世界之一部分。是生理学的领域，生理学是心理学的必要基础。心理学又是教育学的重大基础之一。苏联教育学者平克微支，阐扬苏联教育理论时，其基础之一，就是巴夫洛夫和巴夫洛夫派的心理学。他的苏联共和国的新教育，用了八分之一的地位述及这派客观心理学对教育的启示。巴氏的影响遍世界了。以资本主义的教育科学著名于世界的美国。受巴氏的影响也不小。不过自一九二四以后，由于阶级性的压迫，就没有大进展了。
    巴氏学说怎样影响了教育呢？起源于他在一九○一年的空前实验发现，就是“制约反射”，原译交替反射，有些不妥，篇幅不允许述其细节。简括言之，以摇铃喂狗流涎，随后摇铃不喂食物也流涎为例，一种原来不足引起某种反应或反射“丙一”的刺激，“甲”可以和另一足够引起此反应的刺激“乙”，经过一次或一次以上结合起来同时发生，便可以变成一个足够引起此反应“丙二”的刺激“甲二”。甲二叫做制约刺激，乙叫做非制约刺戟。丙二叫做制约反应或反射。全部刺激与反应的过程。是通过神经系统的。人的全部心理状态，可用反射来说明（见巴氏著“大脑之常态活动与一般组成”）。旧的本能说以及情绪，不过是复杂的反射丛。思想就是最复杂的遏抑的反射丛（见巴氏著“动物高等神经活动之客观研究”和发扬此理论的柏忌特列夫著“反射学”）。人的全部学习和行为，可用制约反射来说明，组织体从出生到长大成熟之变化，无非是一套繁杂万端或千头万绪的制约反射。“性相近也，习相远也。”这话到了巴氏手里更为明白。制约反射成了改造人类行为，改造学习，改造教育的一把科学的钥匙了。
    据说，过去四十多年，各国对制约反射的单独实验不下一千五百种，先后应用在研究儿童，研究神经病，研究各种学习。例如记忆诗文，避免传染病，发现种族偏见，学习外国语、打字，研究情绪；例如怕黑暗的原因，爱好某种音乐，某种嫌恶或偏见与态度是怎样来的等。由于巴氏学说与马克思主义是一致的，所以在苏联特别发达。首先有上述拍忌特列夫的反射学，柯尼洛夫反的作用学和柏郎斯基的科学心理，已有了相当完整的体系。我国郭一岑先生曾译介过（见中华版“苏俄新兴心理学”）。在德国有蒙士特柏格、李曼等人，在美国有桑戴克的感应结华真的行为主义等。桑氏对教育测验和教学法，尤其是算术教学法影响甚大。他的著作成名，远在一九○一年以后，正当柏忌特列夫的“客观心理学”的译本于一九一三年在美国出版后，桑氏才大享盛名，从时间上看，决不会没有巴氏的影响。不过桑氏的观念联合太主观了，巴氏的制约，则不管主观的观念和意象，而是客观地正确地测量刺激与反应，树立了确凿的量的原则。甚至供给了社会学与生物学以可证明的假定。美国华真的行为主义曾盛极一时，其内容全部是根据巴氏学说的。他著了“行为主义”和“婴儿与儿童之心理的监护”，在我国有郭任远介绍过。此外在美国采用巴氏学说立论的，有亚耳波特的“社会心理学”、柏恩罕的“常态心理”、谢非耳的“调适心理”、古事锐的“人的矛盾心理”，而且是很著名的作品。在美国采取巴氏立场而为心理学家们所公认为巴派的则有山地浮德的“教育心理学”——一个客观的研究（一九二九年长人书局版北大有此书）。
    巴氏做了开山的工作，从辩证唯物论的观点看，为心理学开了一个崭新的境界。好比探险于两极。以前有人认为不可能，现在可能了。自然科学是一例。巴氏对心理学的远相，好一比，人类要探险于星空，人将有说不可能的。在心理学上，美国人也这样有些泄气（见“现代教育百科全书”六三一面）。巴氏肯定而坚决地这样说过：“将有一个时候来到，纵然是尚远。根据自然科学的方法，数学的分析，将会以一个堂皇的公式，包罗一切平衡的因素，最后包括人类自己。”又说“在动物的头脑的纯粹生理学所进入的大路上，科学正等待着神经系统的发现。有如自然科学之成就同样的惊人和同样的威力。”我们教育学界正等着这些发现。不过在目前从巴氏已有的发现，已经引起了教育思想的重大革命。总结其要点有五：（一）人的改造和教育，有了极大的可能性。制约反射更打破了遗传的迷信。改造了我们对人的个性与性向等的狭隘的观点（见华真的豪言），创造一代新人有可能了。新民主主义、社会主义、共产主义的新人是可以实现的，无产阶级的心智上的翻身有了根据。因为没有天生的愚昧了。（二）更使我们打破教育上的主观主义，改造了学习方法，学习的关键在控制适当的刺激，引起适当的反应。我们的习惯之养成与打破有了科学的办法，或者应当说，至少想用科学的方法，一个教育学术机关的侧重点应当明白了。（三）明白了社会环境，尤其是经济环境在教育上之巨大的作用。制约反射，给予了科学的证明。并且指示了布置学习环境的途径。（四）身体与健康教育之重要性，学前教育与托儿所之极大重要性，成人教育也更有可能。而内分泌学、营养学等，到了教育者手里成了利器。医学可以转向预防方面发展，医学与教育学合作成了新的趋向。在教材教法上，特别重视群众生活之制约的影响。尤其是情感与意志方面的制约，伟大的人格崇高的理想，可以养成。教材内容重视活动与行为。因为教材是行为和经验的单元了。用巴氏的话说，是制约反射的组成了。
