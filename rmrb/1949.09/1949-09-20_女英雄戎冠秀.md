　　Woman Hero Rong Guanxiu
　　Rong Guanxiu is from Xiapan Song, Pingshan, and is currently fifty-two years old. She was born into a poor peasant family and married at the age of fifteen. Her husband's family were tenant farmers. She spent all year round grinding, cooking, and feeding pigs for the landlord. Her husband carried water and chopped firewood for others, and Rong Guanxiu worked in the fields like a man. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, she served as the director of the village women's association. She was grateful to the Eighth Route Army for exempting her from high rents and forced labor, and treated the soldiers like her own family. At the First Heroes' Congress of the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region, she received the honorary title of "Mother of the Soldiers."
　　After Rong Guanxiu returned to the village from the Heroes' Congress, she mobilized all fifty-three households in the village to hold family meetings and set production plans.
　　The women's work exchange team in Xiapan Song was the first to be organized, with a total of eight groups. Rong Guanxiu served as the work exchange team leader. Work exchange was carried out for everything from grinding and carrying water to picking peppercorns and stripping corn. Grinding and carrying water were done in shifts, and for collecting manure, the people from each group were divided into several teams to collect it outside the village every day. Each group also took turns sending two people to collect manure with the cattle herd, and the collected manure was distributed according to work points. Because one person making shoes was too slow, she also organized a work exchange for making soles. Plowing, weeding, and autumn harvesting were done with each person eating their own food, with one person taking turns for one day. During the autumn harvest, in order to prepare for the "mopping-up" operations, quick harvesting, quick threshing, and quick hiding were implemented. The women's work exchange team worked together in the fields. When the situation was tense and the men were all away on duty, Rong Guanxiu led the women in work exchange and mutual assistance, and in one day they fortified all the village's grain.
　　Xiapan Song is located in a relatively remote mountain gully, and the work was relatively backward. But under the influence of Rong Guanxiu, Xiapan Song changed its appearance in production, and every household harvested more grain. She also launched and organized sanitation campaigns, study campaigns, and established a winter school. Whenever soldiers passed through the village, she always greeted them like family, offering them water, food, and lodging. In addition, she also did a lot of work to help the military families with their production, so all the difficulties of the military families in the village were resolved.

　　女英雄戎冠秀
    戎冠秀，平山下盘松人，现年五十二岁。他生长在贫农家里，十五岁上结了婚，婆家是个佃户，她一年四季给地主家推碾、做饭、喂猪，她的丈夫给人担水、劈柴，戎冠秀就顶着一个男人下田干活。抗战中她当了村妇救会主任，她感激八路军给她免除了高租和苦役，对待子弟兵更象自己的亲人一般。在晋冀察边区第一届群英大会上，她得到了“子弟兵的母亲”的光荣称号。
    戎冠秀从群英大会回到村里以后，她就动员了全村五十三户开家庭会议，订下生产计划。
    下盘松的妇女拨工队是最先组织起来的，一共成立了八组，戎冠秀担任了拨工队长。从推碾，抬水，到摘花椒，撇玉茭都进行了拨工。轮流推碾抬水，拾粪是每天把各组的人分成几路到村外去拾，每天每组还轮流派两个人跟牛群拾粪，拾回来按工分粪。一个人做鞋太慢，她又组织了铺底子拨工。锄苗、秋收等营生是各人吃各人的饭，一人一天的轮流拨。秋收时为了准备反“扫荡”，实行快收、快打、快藏。妇女拨工队一齐下地工作。情况紧张时，男人都出了差，戎冠秀领导妇女拨工互助，一天就把全村粮食坚壁出去。
    下盘松处在比较偏僻的山沟里，工作比较落后。但在戎冠秀的影响下，下盘松在生产里变了样子，家家都多打了粮食。她还发动组织了卫生运动，学习运动，设立了冬学，逢到子弟兵经过本村，总是象亲人一样地招呼他们喝水、吃饭、住宿。此外，还做了许多帮助军属生产的工作，全村军属的一切困难，因此都得到了解决。
