Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 19th: The Shandong Provincial Government convened an enlarged meeting of the Government Committee on September 7th, drafting and discussing a work plan for the government for this autumn and winter. The plan first pointed out the characteristics of Shandong's transition from war to construction, and determined that the future government work guidelines would be: to mobilize and organize all the people of Shandong to restore and develop production, strengthen cultural and educational work, strengthen public security work, strengthen the construction of democratic power, practice strict economy, overcome difficulties, and support the front lines. It determined that restoring and developing production should be the central task, and all other work should revolve around and serve production work. The meeting also discussed the issue of strengthening the construction of democratic power, and decided to first convene people's representative conferences at the city and county levels within a specified time to strengthen democratic construction and prepare for the transition to people's congresses. Cities with a population of more than 30,000 should actively prepare and strive to convene people's representative conferences as soon as possible. Towns with a concentrated population of 10,000 to 20,000 and developed commerce should also convene people's representative conferences. All counties, districts, and townships in old and semi-old areas should convene people's representative conferences this winter. In places where conditions are ripe, fully-powered people's congresses elected by universal suffrage should be convened. In new areas, county people's representative meetings should be convened, and district and township peasant representative meetings should be convened. The provincial government will convene a people's representative meeting this winter to report the government's work to the people's representatives, discuss the policy guidelines under the new situation, and re-elect members of the provincial government.

Taiyuan Dispatch: The first enlarged meeting of the Shanxi Provincial People's Government Committee began on September 12th and successfully concluded on the 14th after three days. The meeting formally adopted the province's work plan for this autumn and winter. A summary report is as follows:

The guidelines for this autumn and winter are to continue to complete the tasks of production, cultural education, and public security work this year, and to lay a solid foundation for next year's large-scale production campaign and construction work. Regarding production and construction work: In the industrial sector, assist and ensure that state-owned industries complete their production plans from August to December. According to needs and possibilities, manufacture waterwheels, water pumps, cotton gins, oil presses, etc. in large quantities to support agricultural production. Assist trade union work, implement the democratization of factory management, strive to reduce costs, improve quality, and sell more at a small profit. For private industries, assistance should be given to their development by adjusting labor-capital relations and guiding their production and sales directions. In the agricultural sector, wheat fields must be well planted, autumn harvesting and autumn plowing must be done well, seed selection must be implemented, and pests must be eliminated and prevented. Livestock should be protected and bred, nurseries and forests should be strengthened, farm tools should be prepared for next year, and water conservancy preparation work should be carried out. Develop sideline and handicraft production to overcome natural disasters. At the same time, we must do a good job in providing preferential treatment to military families by plowing their land and resettling and providing production for disabled soldiers. In terms of urban-rural relations and internal and external exchanges, we must first do our best to promote the sale of this year's surplus agricultural products, supply farmers with necessities, solve the problem of raw materials for factory industries, ensure the completion of the North China Trade Corporation's plan to absorb and regulate materials in Shanxi, and implement the People's Bank of China's general policy of combining the export of local specialties with foreign exchange. Secondly, we should establish and improve the leadership organizations of cooperatives at all levels, reorganize and transform old cooperatives, and require all localities to adjust and organize county cooperatives by the end of the year; and mass transportation undertakings must be organized on a large scale. In terms of finance and taxation, on the basis of the policies and systems already determined by the North China People's Government, through the work in autumn and winter, we should achieve the unification and consistency of the implementation of policies and systems in various regions, so as to roughly balance the burden, develop production, and put financial construction on the right track. Establish financial and economic committees above the county level to unify forces and pace.

In addition, there are clear regulations regarding education, health, and public security and judicial work. As for democratic governance, people's representative conferences should be established in cities with a population of more than 30,000 in October, people's representative conferences should be established in all counties before the end of October, and provincial people's representative conferences should be established in November. In old areas, village people's representative conferences should be established and improved in conjunction with central work. The meeting formulated and passed two methods for convening representative conferences from all walks of life in counties, industrial and mining areas, and urban districts, streamlining and saving money, which have been submitted to the North China People's Government and will be promulgated and implemented after approval.
