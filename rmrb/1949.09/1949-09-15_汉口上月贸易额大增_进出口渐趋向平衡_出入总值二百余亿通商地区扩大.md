[Hankou News] Due to the victorious advance of the People's Liberation Army to the south, transportation between this port and the newly liberated areas has rapidly recovered. Newly liberated ships have joined the shipping operations, the relationship between urban and rural areas has improved, and the rural economy has become more active after the autumn harvest. In particular, the business community has gradually understood the New Democratic economic policies and started to engage in trade. As a result, the total value of foreign trade, the trading area, and the types of goods exchanged in this city have all shown significant increases in August. According to Jianghan Customs statistics, the total value of imports and exports in August reached 22.288 billion yuan, nearly eight times more than in June (equivalent to 783% of June), and about three times more than in July (equivalent to 289% of July).

In terms of trading areas, in June, trade was mainly conducted with Shanghai, while trade with other places such as Nanjing was very limited. In July, it increased to nine locations, and in August, it further expanded to more than ten places, including Shanghai, Changsha, Nanjing, Nanchang, Tanggu, Zhenjiang, Shashi, Tuanfeng, Jiujiang, Wuhu, Shihuiyao, Yichang, Ouchi, and Jianli.

In terms of the types of goods exchanged, August also saw an increase of about 100% compared to June and July.

The total value of imports was 12.3 billion yuan, of which 11.6 billion yuan were domestic goods and about 700 million yuan were foreign goods. Domestic goods included 62 types, with cotton piece goods ranking first at a value of over 2.85 billion yuan; cotton yarn ranking second at a value of over 2.42 billion yuan; cotton products ranking third at a value of over 1.61 billion yuan; and domestic Western medicine ranking fourth at a value of over 1.61 billion yuan. Other items included cigarettes, cotton, salt, rubber products, sugar, and coal.

The total value of exports was 9.98 billion yuan, of which 9.918 billion yuan were domestic goods and 58 million yuan were foreign goods. Domestic goods included 60 types, with cotton ranking first at over 13,500 metric tons, valued at over 2.519 billion yuan; cotton piece goods ranking second at a value of over 777 million yuan; rice ranking third at over 16,000 metric tons, valued at over 580 million yuan; and beans ranking fourth at over 37,000 metric tons, valued at over 440 million yuan. Other items included tobacco leaves, tung oil, cotton yarn, leather oil, salt, and cigarettes.

The total value of the aforementioned imports and exports of domestic goods was 21.5 billion yuan, with the ratio of exports to imports being 89 to 100, and the ratio of public to private enterprises being 85 to 100.

From the above figures and ratios, it can be seen that not only was there a significant increase in the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas in August, but also that imports and exports are gradually moving towards balance, which has greatly improved Wuhan's trade deficit. Moreover, the increasing volume of goods imported and exported by public enterprises further illustrates that: (1) Public enterprises have greatly strengthened their role in promoting the exchange of goods and actively allocating materials; (2) Public enterprises continue to increase the quantity of materials they control, which enhances their power to control the market and stabilize prices; (3) Due to the strengthened proactive role of public enterprises, it will play a significant role in encouraging and supporting private enterprises.

August is still a transitional period for commercial trade moving from a "slow month" to a "peak month." After September, it will enter the "peak month." Judging from the recent development of market transactions in Wuhan and other places, this month's figures will see even greater increases.

### 汉口上月贸易额大增　进出口渐趋向平衡  出入总值二百余亿通商地区扩大

　　汉口上月贸易额大增
  　进出口渐趋向平衡
    出入总值二百余亿通商地区扩大
    【汉口讯】由于解放大军胜利南进，本埠与新解放区交通迅速恢复，新解放的轮只参加航运，城乡关系改善，秋收后农村经济较前活泼，特别是工商界对新民主主义的经济政策逐渐了解并展开贸易等原因，本市对外埠贸易总值、通商地区以及交流货物种类，在上（八）月份都呈着显著的增进。据江汉关统计，八月份进出口总值达二百廿二亿八千万元，比六月份约多近八倍（相当于六月份的百分之七百八十三），比七月份约多三倍（相当于七月份的百分之二百八十九）。
    就通商地区说，六月份主要只是和上海通商，其他如南京等地为量甚为有限，七月份增加到九处，八月份则增加到上海、长沙、南京、南昌、塘沽、镇江、沙市、团风、九江、芜湖、石灰窑、宜昌、藕池、监利等十余处。
    就交流物资种类说，八月份较六、七两月也增加到约一倍。
    其中进口总值为一百二十三亿元，内国货一百一十六亿元，外货约为七亿元。国货包括六十二种，第一位为棉匹头，价值二十八亿五千余万元；第二位棉纱，价值二十四亿二千余万元；第三位棉制品，价值十六亿一千余万元；第四位国产西药，价值十六亿一千余万元；其他纸烟、棉花、食盐、橡胶制品、食糖、燃煤等。
    出口总值为九十九亿八千万元，内国货九十九亿一千八百余万元，外货五千八百余万元。国货包括六十种，第一位为棉花，计重一万三千五百余公担，价值二十五亿一千九百余万元；第二位为棉匹头，价值七亿七千七百余万元；第三位食米一万六千余公担，价值五亿八千余万元；第四位豆类三万七千余公担，价值四亿四千余万元；余为烟叶、桐油、棉纱、皮油、食盐、香烟等。
    上述进出口国货总值二百一十五亿元，出口与进口成八十九与一百之比；公营与私营成八十五与一百之比。
    从上述数字及比例，不仅说明了八月份的城乡内外交流物资有了显著的增加，而且进出口物资逐渐趋向平衡，这大大改善了武汉贸易的入超地位；而公营企业的物资进出数字继续增多，这更说明了（一）公营企业对促进物资交流及主动调拨物资的作用已经大形加强；（二）公营企业掌握的物资数量继续增多，这增强了公营企业对掌握市场及稳定物价的力量；（三）由于公营企业的主动作用加强，对于私营企业的鼓励和扶助，将起着很大的作用。
    八月份还是商业贸易由“淡月”转入“旺月”的过渡时期，九月以后进入“旺月”，再从最近武汉及各地市场交易的发展情况推测，本月的数字将会有更大的增加。
