Pavlov

　　September 26th is the centenary of Pavlov's birth. He was born on September 26, 1849, and died on February 27, 1936.

　　Pavlov was a brilliant Russian physiologist who had a tremendous influence on the development of science worldwide. His great achievement was the creation of the theory of higher nervous activity and conditioned reflexes. Pavlov's theory explains human psychological life: its internal experiences, sensations, thoughts, and feelings are all based on brain activity and are the result of certain physiological factors. Thus, Pavlov's theory helps to correctly explain what consciousness is and points out the unity of material and spiritual processes, which is the victory of the materialist worldview. Pavlov's work also paved new paths for understanding the essence of digestion and blood circulation processes and for studying and treating countless human diseases.

　　Pavlov was a true patriot who loved his country. He rejoiced in the achievements of his people, the cultural and scientific achievements of Russia, and the achievements of the Soviets. He once said: "I dedicate all my energy, first and foremost, to our motherland. The fate of the motherland, which is engaged in socialist construction, deeply moves me. I want to live to see the results of the construction of our socialist motherland." At the International Physiological Congress in 1935, he enthusiastically declared that he was a citizen of the great motherland that defends world peace, and he delivered a speech denouncing fascism.
