Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 10th: According to TASS, New York: The Americas Congress in Support of Peace, currently being held in Mexico City, is proceeding vigorously. The representatives expressed warm welcome for congratulatory messages from mass organizations and international organizations from various countries. After the first plenary session on the 6th, the work of the conference proceeded in groups. The groups met on the 7th and 8th to draft proposals for the plenary session and study the issues of youth, writers, educators, scientists, women, workers and farmers participating in the struggle for peace and democracy.

At the plenary session on the 6th, representatives from various countries spoke out one after another, denouncing the warmongers and pointing out that the Soviet Union is the main force for peace. When the chairman of the Latin American Labor Federation, Toledano, spoke, he sharply criticized those who believed that war was inevitable. Toledano said: "It is absolutely true that the Soviet Union is fighting against war, and its foreign policy has consistently demonstrated this." Toledano called for the establishment of the Americas Peace Committee to carry out the peace struggle in the Western Hemisphere. He said that Latin American countries "must not endure the current situation for long and become colonies of Wall Street."

Canadian representative Dr. James Endicott, in his speech, severely criticized American policy and the "atomic lunatics" of American imperialism. Endicott strongly criticized the US government for refusing to grant transit visas to Canadian representatives who wanted to come to Mexico City to participate in the Americas Congress in Support of Peace, forcing many representatives to return to Canada and making other representatives detour through the West Indies to reach Mexico City.

Endicott said that the Canadian ruling group sold out the interests of the Canadian people and sold Canadian interests to American imperialism. There are American troops stationed in Edmonton, Alberta, and American trusts are allowed to exploit Canada's natural resources. Referring to the Washington Tripartite Financial Conference, Endicott said: "The interests of all smaller countries need to break the control of the dollar and trade with all countries."

Rio de Janeiro Treaty is a Tool of War; Latin American Countries Should Withdraw Immediately

Vilaami, a well-known Cuban expert on Catholic sacred texts, criticized the Vatican's order to excommunicate Communist Party members and Communist Party sympathizers.

The head of the Guatemalan delegation, Fotonie, claimed that the United States was attempting to involve Latin America in any war that US imperialism might become involved in through the Rio de Janeiro Treaty and the North Atlantic Treaty. He said: "The signing of the Rio de Janeiro Treaty is aimed at concealing an attack on the Soviet Union. But under the provisions of the treaty, spies are sent to our country." Fotonie called out: Latin American countries should withdraw from the Rio de Janeiro Treaty.

The Brazilian representative also accused the Rio de Janeiro Treaty of being a tool of war, claiming that the Brazilian people would refuse to participate in a war of aggression to attack any people, especially the Soviet Union. Brazilian dictator Dutra "has placed Brazil under a bloody dictatorship."

The leader of the Puerto Rican Independence Party, Rolong, and the leader of the Puerto Rican General Labor Union, Gonzalez, both strongly condemned the United States' exploitation of Puerto Rico. Rolong said that in recent years, the United States has been implementing a policy of turning Puerto Rico into a military prison.

Henry, the head of the CIO Fur Workers Union and a US representative, emphasized that as a result of the war movement of US imperialists, democratic rights in the United States have been curtailed. He said: "The reactionary frenzy war movement has stirred up extremely violent and hateful atrocities against the 15 million black people in the United States. There are incidents of lynching, police brutality, or other atrocities every week." Another US representative, David Robison, director of the Hollywood Arts and Sciences Council, emphasized that the peace movement in the United States is growing despite repression.

Argentine women's leader Pons said: "Argentine women have united to oppose the warmongers. Despite the threat of the atomic bomb, we will show that if we fight for peace, we can win peace."

Guevara, chairman of the Cuban Student Federation, pointed out that US imperialism is trying to split the working class in Latin America, and he called for fighting for peace.

Internationally renowned Chilean poet Neruda was greeted with a storm of applause. He gave a brief speech to the conference. The conference elected the following honorary presidium: former Mexican President Cárdenas and De la Surda, former Cuban President Batista, Wallace, Chaplin, Robeson, Prestes, Chilean female poet Mistral, Fadeyev, Nanni, Ibarruri.

The group of the conference dealing with public opinion issues listened to the opinions of various parties and emphasized that progressive elements in Latin America must establish their own news agencies and newspapers, because American reactionary news agencies play a controlling role in news reports in Latin America, and these reactionary news agencies are engaged in war propaganda.

　　美洲和平大会热烈进行
　  南美各国代表发言
　  痛斥美帝侵略政策
    拥护苏联为和平而斗争
    【新华社北平十日电】据塔斯社纽约讯：在墨西哥城举行的美洲拥护和平大会现正热烈进行中。代表们对来自各国群众团体及国际组织的贺电，表示热烈欢迎。在六日的第一次全会后，大会的工作即分小组进行。各小组在七、八两日开会，为全会起草议案，研讨有关青年、作家、教育工作者、科学工作者、妇女、工人及农人参加争取和平与民主斗争的问题。
    在六日的全会上，各国代表曾纷纷发言，痛斥战争贩子，并指出苏联是主要的和平力量。拉丁美洲劳工联盟主席托列达诺发言时，对那些认为战争不可避免的人们，予以尖锐批评。托列达诺称：“苏联为反对战争而斗争，那是千真万确的，它的外交政策一贯不渝地表明了这一点”。托列达诺号召成立美洲拥护和平委员会，以进行西半球的和平斗争。他说：拉丁美洲国家“绝不能长久忍受目前这样的生活，变成华尔街的殖民地”。
    加拿大代表文幼章博士发言时，对美国政策及美国帝国主义的“原子疯人们”，予以剧烈的抨击。文幼章强烈批评美国政府拒绝给予那些想来墨西哥城参加美洲拥护和平大会的加拿大代表们以过境签证，迫使许多代表们不得不重返加拿大，并使其他的代表们绕道经过西印度，方始到达墨西哥城。
    文幼章说：加拿大统治集团出卖加拿大人民的利益，并将加拿大利益出卖给美国帝国主义。在阿尔伯达省厄德梦吞城驻有美国军队，并让美国托辣斯榨取加拿大的天然资源。文幼章在述及华盛顿三国金融会议时称：“所有较小国家的利益，需要打破美元的统制，而与所有国家通商”。
    里约热内卢条约是战争工具　拉丁美洲各国应即退出
    著名的古巴天主教圣典专家维拉米，抨击梵蒂冈下令把共产党党员及共产党同情分子开除教籍。
    危地马拉代表团团长福同尼声称：美国企图通过里约热内卢条约及北大西洋公约，把拉丁美洲牵连到美帝国主义将来卷入的任何战争中去。他说：“里约热内卢条约的签订，目的是在掩饰对苏联的进攻。但在条约的规定下，把间谍派到我们国家来。”福同尼号召说：拉丁美洲国家应当退出里约热内卢条约。
    巴西代表也指责里约热内卢条约是战争工具，声称：巴西人民将拒绝参加侵略战争去进攻任何人民，尤其是苏联。巴西独裁者杜特拉“已将巴西放在血腥的独裁制度之下。”
    波多黎各独立党领袖罗龙和波多黎各总工会领袖冈查里斯都强烈谴责美国对波多黎各的剥削。罗龙说：近年来美国执行着要把波多黎各变为军事监狱的政策。
    美国代表产联毛皮工人工会负责人亨利强调指出：美帝国主义者们进行战争运动的结果，民主权利在美国已被削减。他说：“反动派的疯狂战争运动，煽起了对美国一千五百万黑人的极狂暴的可恨暴行。每周都要发生一些私刑拷打、警察残忍行为或其他暴行的事件”。另一美国代表、好莱坞艺术与科学理事会理事大维·罗比逊强调指出，和平运动在美国尽管遭受镇压，但正在日益增长。
    阿根廷妇女领袖庞斯说：“阿根廷妇女已团结起来反对战争贩子。尽管有原子弹的威胁，我们仍将表明：如果我们为和平斗争，就能赢得和平。”
    古巴学联主席盖瓦拉指出美帝国主义正力图分裂拉丁美洲的工人阶级，他号召为和平而斗争。
    闻名国际的智利诗人尼鲁达受到暴风雨似的掌声的欢迎。他向大会发表了简短的演说。大会选出下列名誉主席团：前墨西哥总统卡登纳斯与德拉苏尔达、前古巴总统巴蒂斯达、华莱士、卓别麟、罗伯逊、普列斯特斯、智利女诗人米斯特拉尔、法捷也夫、南尼、伊巴丽露。
    大会处理舆论问题的小组听取了各方人士的意见后强调指出：拉丁美洲的进步分子必须建立自己的通讯社和报纸，因为美国反动通讯社在拉丁美洲的新闻报道中起着控制作用，而这些反动通讯社都从事战争宣传。
