　　A Letter to a Comrade in Shanghai
    ——Discussion on "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship"
    Yang Fu
    Your letter details the debate you are having about whether "the people's democratic dictatorship essentially plays the role of the proletarian dictatorship," and states that "the two sides' opinions have remained opposed and unresolved." In Beijing, there are also roughly the same debates. From what I have seen and heard, there are various views on this issue, such as saying that the people's democratic dictatorship "essentially" or "basically" is the proletarian dictatorship; or that the people's democratic dictatorship is the "initial stage" or "beginning stage" of the proletarian dictatorship; or that "the people's democratic dictatorship essentially plays the role of the proletarian dictatorship," and so on. These are different ways of saying the same thing. Another opinion is that the people's democratic dictatorship is not the proletarian dictatorship. I have also considered this issue, and I am now writing down my personal views on this issue for discussion with you. Please offer your opinions if there are any inappropriate points.
    I think that to discuss this issue, we must first clarify what the proletarian dictatorship is, who the proletarian dictatorship is dictating to, and what the tasks of the proletarian dictatorship are. Lenin said that the fundamental question of the revolution is the question of political power, that is, who rules whom and who dictates to whom. The proletarian dictatorship is the rule of the proletariat over the bourgeoisie, or the dictatorship over the bourgeoisie, and the task of the proletarian dictatorship is to eliminate the bourgeoisie. Lenin also said: "The state, that is, the proletariat organized as the ruling class—that is the dictatorship of the proletariat." One view in your letter states: "Because the first role of the proletarian dictatorship is to suppress the overthrown classes and eliminate their attempts to restore their rule, the people's democratic dictatorship in China today also plays this role." What class does "the overthrown class" here refer to? The question is posed abstractly and generally. If it refers to the entire bourgeoisie, then the so-called "the people's democratic dictatorship in China today also plays this role" is equivalent to saying that the Chinese people's democratic dictatorship generally eliminates the bourgeoisie, and not just eliminates the imperialists who invaded China, the feudal landlord class, and the bureaucratic bourgeoisie. If this is the understanding, I think it is wrong.
    Today, Chairman Mao has defined the people's democratic dictatorship of China's new democratic revolution very completely and clearly as "the people's democratic dictatorship led by the proletariat and based on the worker-peasant alliance." Today, China's people's democratic regime is the joint dictatorship of the proletariat (the leading component), the peasant class, the petty bourgeoisie, and the national bourgeoisie over imperialism, feudal forces, and the bureaucratic bourgeoisie, that is, the four friends exercising dictatorship over the three enemies, rather than the proletariat exercising dictatorship over the bourgeoisie. Because today, the task of the Chinese revolution is to drive imperialism out of China, eliminate feudal forces, and a part of the bourgeoisie, namely the bureaucratic bourgeoisie, and not to generally eliminate capitalism and the bourgeoisie. Today, the national bourgeoisie still has a certain progressive role in the recovery and development of production. Therefore, it is undoubtedly inappropriate to say that the Chinese people's democratic dictatorship is the proletarian dictatorship or that it is "essentially" or "basically" the proletarian dictatorship.
    What problem is being addressed by posing the question in this way: that the Chinese people's democratic dictatorship is the proletarian dictatorship? Is it to explain that the people's democratic dictatorship is led by the proletariat? Chairman Mao has already made it very clear that it is led by the proletariat, but proletarian leadership does not equal proletarian dictatorship; is it to explain the foundation of the people's democratic dictatorship? Chairman Mao also said that it is "based on the worker-peasant alliance," but a regime based on the worker-peasant alliance is not necessarily a proletarian dictatorship; is it to explain that the people's democratic dictatorship is a guarantee for moving towards socialism? Chairman Mao also said, "The transition from new democracy to socialism mainly relies on the alliance of these two classes." It can be seen that it is not yet the proletarian dictatorship, but the people's democratic dictatorship led by the proletariat. From this point of view, saying that the Chinese people's democratic dictatorship is the proletarian dictatorship does not explain any problem, and such a statement is still very harmful.
    There is another saying: "Today, the people's democratic dictatorship is not equal to the proletarian dictatorship, but it essentially plays the role of the proletarian dictatorship (i.e., a partial role)." What does this mean? Does it mean that in the dictatorship of several revolutionary classes over the running dogs of imperialism, i.e., the landlord class and the bureaucratic bourgeoisie and their representative, the Kuomintang reactionaries, the proletariat also participates in a part, and therefore it is said that the proletariat plays a "partial role of the proletarian dictatorship"? If this is the meaning, then the bourgeoisie participating in the people's democratic dictatorship can also say that they essentially play the role of the bourgeoisie dictatorship in the people's democratic dictatorship (i.e., a partial role). If this logic continues, then the proletariat, the peasant class, the petty bourgeoisie, and the national bourgeoisie essentially all play their respective partial dictatorial roles, and adding them up in this way will form a simplified "joint dictatorship of several revolutionary classes," or the equal distribution of power among the classes. Isn't this complete "mechanicism"?
    Some people compare the example of the people's democratic countries in Eastern Europe with China, saying: "The proletarian dictatorship and the people's democratic dictatorship are both politically 'based on the worker-peasant alliance,' so 'the Chinese people's democratic dictatorship essentially plays the role of the proletarian dictatorship.'" I think the first sentence is correct, but the second sentence has problems. Because the Chinese people's democratic dictatorship is different from the people's democratic dictatorship in Eastern European countries, which is that the Chinese national bourgeoisie (and other democratic parties) also participate in the government, although they are not the leading class and cannot occupy a major position in the government—can this fact be denied? In terms of the socio-economic foundation, the industry in Eastern European people's democratic countries (especially Poland, Czechoslovakia, etc.) is quite developed, and state-owned industry accounts for 85% of industry; secondly, these countries were liberated with the help of the Soviet Red Army, and the people of these countries and the power of the Soviet Red Army destroyed the foundation of the bourgeoisie, so after these countries received Soviet assistance, they developed economically for a period and possessed the foundation of socialism, and thus the regime quickly turned into a dictatorship of the proletariat in essence. However, the situation in China is clearly different from these countries. The Chinese national bourgeoisie is also oppressed by imperialism and the bureaucratic bourgeoisie, so they have the demand to oppose imperialism and the bureaucratic bourgeoisie; during the Anti-Japanese War, they participated in the Anti-Japanese War, and after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, they opposed the US and Chiang. These specific different conditions cannot be ignored when analyzing the problem.
    Some people also use Lenin's words as a basis. Lenin said: "The transition from capitalism to communism certainly cannot but produce a wealth and variety of political forms, but their essence is inevitably the same: the dictatorship of the proletariat." (State and Revolution, Chapter 2) Therefore, they firmly believe that the Chinese people's democratic dictatorship is also the proletarian dictatorship, or essentially the proletarian dictatorship. But they do not think about when Lenin said these words. It is inappropriate to rigidly or randomly apply Lenin's words from more than 30 years ago (when Lenin wrote "State and Revolution" in 1917) to China today, I think.
    One of the most basic methods of Marxism is to proceed from reality and specifically analyze specific problems. The so-called specific analysis method mainly means the method of class analysis. Starting from the concept of book conclusions and making abstract analogies or comparisons of similar situations in other countries, without specifically analyzing China's specific situation—the situation of class relations, the conclusions drawn will inevitably be subjective or dogmatic. Today's basic situation in China—class relations—is three enemies and four friends, and the four friends are different from each other, that is, the proletariat is the class leading the revolution. The basic force of the revolution is the alliance of the working class, the peasant class, and the petty bourgeoisie, and mainly the alliance of the working class and the peasant class; "the national bourgeoisie has great importance at the present stage,... unite the national bourgeoisie and fight together." The "leadership," "foundation," and "unity" mentioned here explain the class relations of the four friends, which is to explain class analysis. These four friends are the ruling class, and the three enemies are the ruled class, which also explains class relations and class analysis. Therefore, the Chinese people's democratic dictatorship is not the proletarian dictatorship, but "the people's democratic dictatorship led by the proletariat and based on the worker-peasant alliance." These several revolutionary classes "exercise dictatorship, exercise autocracy, and oppress these people towards the running dogs of imperialism, namely the landlord class and the bureaucratic bourgeoisie, and the Kuomintang reactionaries and their accomplices representing these classes." (See "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship") Therefore, whether it is said that the people's democratic dictatorship is the proletarian dictatorship, or "basically" the proletarian dictatorship, or "essentially plays the role of the proletarian dictatorship," it is inappropriate, one-sided, and does not conform to the actual situation in China.
    People who say or think this way seem to be higher than others in Marxism-Leninism (?), more revolutionary (?), and more steadfast in their proletarian stance (?). In fact, this is not necessarily the case. It just proves the ambiguity of their own concepts and the confusion of their thinking. This kind of statement or idea is wrong and harmful.
    People who say or think this way are superficially "left," but actually right, or "left" for now and "right" for the future. Because they think that the current people's democratic dictatorship is the proletarian dictatorship, thus canceling the new democratic revolution; then when it really needs to transition to socialism in the future, they will say that the people's democratic dictatorship is already the proletarian dictatorship, so what is the need for the proletarian dictatorship? Thus, in essence, it is canceling the socialist revolution again. In this way, it not only opposes Chairman Mao's view that "the Chinese revolution should be divided into two steps," but also opposes the view of "accomplishing everything in one battle" that Chairman Mao has criticized. Wouldn't the reactionary view that the Chinese revolution is a proletarian socialist revolution, which the Trotskyite bandits have long advocated, be correct again? Isn't this making a problem that was originally very clear even more confusing?
    Comrade, I have written too much, I am afraid it will waste your time, I will not write for now. This issue has not been discussed in our school, and errors in my opinion are inevitable. Please do not be polite, and send a letter to point out and discuss.

### 给上海某同志的一封信——讨论“论人民民主专政”

　　给上海某同志的一封信
    ——讨论“论人民民主专政”
    扬甫
    来信中详述了你们关于“人民民主专政是否实质上起无产阶级专政的作用”问题的争论，并说“双方意见一直对立着仍未解决”。这个问题，在北平方面，也有大致相同的争论。据我见闻所及，知道对这个问题的见解有各种各样，例如说人民民主专政“实质上”或“基本上”就是无产阶级专政；或说人民民主专政，是无产阶级专政的“开始阶段”或“最初阶段”，又或说“人民民主专政实质上起了无产阶级专政的作用”等等。这是说法各异而实质相同的。另一意见则认为人民民主专政不是无产阶级专政。对于这个问题，我也曾考虑过，现将我个人对这问题的看法写下来和你们讨论。不妥之处，望你们多提意见。
    我认为要讨论这个问题，首先要弄清楚什么是无产阶级专政，无产阶级专政是对谁专政，与无产阶级专政的任务是什么的问题。列宁说过，革命的基本问题就是政权问题，即谁统治谁、谁对谁专政的问题。无产阶级专政，就是无产阶级统治资产阶级，或对资产阶级专政，而无产阶级专政的任务，就是要消灭资产阶级。列宁又说过：“国家，这是说组成为统治阶级的无产阶级—这就是无产阶级专政。”来信中有一种说法：“由于无产阶级专政的第一个作用，是镇压被推翻的阶级，消灭其恢复统治的企图。在今天中国民主专政，亦起如此作用。”这里说的“被推翻的阶级”是指的什么阶级？问题提得抽象笼统。如果所指的是包括整个资产阶级，那么，所谓“在今天中国人民民主专政亦起如此作用”，也就等于说：中国人民民主专政是一般地消灭资产阶级，而不仅仅是消灭侵略中国的帝国主义，消灭封建地主阶级和官僚资产阶级。若果是如此认识，我想是不对的。
    今天，中国新民主主义革命的人民民主专政，毛主席规定得非常完整而明确，就是“无产阶级领导的以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政。”今天中国的人民民主政权，是无产阶级（领导成份）、农民阶级、小资产阶级、民族资产阶级共同对帝国主义、封建势力、官僚资产阶级施行专政，亦即四个朋友对三个敌人施行专政，而不是由无产阶级来对资产阶级施行专政。因为今天中国革命的任务，是驱逐帝国主义出中国，消灭封建势力，和资产阶级中的一部分，即官僚资产阶级，还不是一般地消灭资本主义和资产阶级。今天民族资产阶级在恢复与发展生产上，还有其一定的进步作用。因此，说中国人民民主专政就是无产阶级专政或说“实质上”“基本上”是无产阶级专政，无疑义是不妥当的。
    这样提问题：中国的人民民主专政就是无产阶级专政，是想解决什么问题呢？要说明人民民主专政是无产阶级领导的吗？这，毛主席已经说得非常清楚，是无产阶级领导的，但无产阶级领导就不等于无产阶级专政；要说明人民民主专政的基础力量吗？这，毛主席也说了，是以“工农联盟为基础”，而工农联盟为基础的政权又不一定是无产阶级专政；要说明人民民主专政是走向社会主义的保障吗？这，毛主席也说了，“由新民主主义到社会主义，主要依靠这两个阶级的联盟。”可见，现在尚不是无产阶级专政，而是无产阶级领导的人民民主专政。这样看来，说中国人民民主专政即无产阶级专政，并没有说明任何问题，而且这样说法还是很有害的。
    还有另一种说法：“今天人民民主专政不等于无产阶级专政，但它实质上起了无产阶级专政的作用（即部分的作用）。”这是什么意思呢？是不是说几个革命阶级对帝国主义走狗，即地主阶级和官僚资产阶级及其代表的国民党反动派的专政中，无产阶级也参加一部分，因此说无产阶级起了“部分的无产阶级专政的作用”呢？如果是这样意思，那么，参加人民民主专政的资产阶级，也可以说他们在人民民主专政中实质上是起了资产阶级专政的作用（亦即部分作用）。如果这样逻辑下去，那么，无产阶级、农民阶级、小资产阶级和民族资产阶级，实质上都是起了各自的部分专政作用了，如此相加起来，就行成一个简单化的“几个革命阶级的联合专政”，或是各阶级平等瓜分政权，这样，岂不是十足的“机械论”吗？
    有人把东欧人民民主国家的例子来和中国作类似的比较和对照，说：“无产阶级专政与人民民主专政在政治上同样是以“工农联盟为基础”，所以“中国人民民主专政实质上起了无产阶级专政的作用”。我觉得前一句话是说对了，但是后一句话就有问题。因为中国的人民民主专政不同于东欧国家的人民民主专政者，就是中国的民族资产阶级（和其他民主党派）也参加了政权，虽然他们不是领导阶级，在政权中也不能占主要地位—这个事实能够否认吗？再就社会经济基础说，东欧人民民主国家（尤其是波、捷等国）工业相当发达，国营工业占工业的百分之八十五；其次，这些国家是在苏联红军帮助之下解放的，这些国家的人民和苏联红军的威力，摧毁了资产阶级的基础，所以这些国家在经过苏联的帮助之后，经济上发展一个时期，就具备了社会主义的基础，于是政权也就很快地转到实质上的无产阶级专政。然而中国的情况，显然和这些国家不同，中国的民族资产阶级，同样是受帝国主义与官僚资产阶级的压迫的，所以他们有反帝反官僚资产阶级的要求；抗日时期，他们参加了抗日，抗日胜利后，他们又反美反蒋。这些具体的不同的条件，在分析问题时是不能忽略的。
    有人又把列宁的话来做根据。列宁这样说过：“由资本主义过渡到共产主义，当然不能不产生很多的和很复杂的政治形式，但在本质上却不免是同一的：无产阶级专政。”（国家与革命第二章）因此，便一口咬定：中国的人民民主专政，也就是无产阶级专政，或实质上是无产阶级专政。但是他们并不想一想，列宁的这些话，是在什么时候说的。把列宁在三十多年以前（一九一七年列宁写国家与革命一书时）说过的话，来对今天的中国硬套或乱套，我想也是不妥当的。
    马克思主义的一个最基本的方法，是从实际出发，具体问题具体分析。所谓具体分析的方法，主要就是说明阶级分析的方法。从书本结论的概念出发及把别国类似情况来做抽象的类比或对照，而对中国的具体情况—阶级关系的情况，不加以具体分析，则作出的结论，将不可免地是主观主义的或教条主义的。今天中国的基本情况—阶级关系，就是三个敌人四个朋友，而四个朋友之中又各不一样，就是说，无产阶级是领导革命的阶级。革命的基础力量，是工人阶级、农民阶级和小资产阶级的联盟，而主要的是工人阶级和农民阶级的联盟；“民族资产阶级在现阶段上有其很大的重要性，………团结民族资产阶级，共同奋斗。”这里说的“领导”，“基础”，“团结”，就是说明了四个朋友的阶级关系，就是说明阶级分析。这四个朋友是统治阶级，而三个敌人是被统治阶级，这也是说明阶级关系，说明阶级分析。所以中国人民民主专政不是无产阶级专政，而是“无产阶级领导的以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政”。这几个革命阶级“向着帝国主义走狗即地主阶级和官僚资产阶级以及代表这些阶级的国民党反动派及其帮凶们实行专政，实行独裁，压迫这些人。”（见“论人民民主专政”）因此，不论是说人民民主专政就是无产阶级专政，或“基本上”是无产阶级专政，或“实质上起了无产阶级专政的作用”，都是不适宜的，片面的，不符合于中国实际情况的。
    这种说法或这种想法的人，好象比别人，马列主义更高些（？），革命性更强些（？），无产阶级立场更坚定些（？），其实未必然，这恰恰证明了自己观念的模糊和思想的混乱。这种说法或想法是错误的有害的。
    这种说法或这种想法的人，表面上是“左”，而实际上是右，或对现在说是“左”而对将来说又是右。因为他们认为现在的人民民主专政，就是无产阶级专政，因而取消了新民主主义革命；那么到将来真要转变到社会主义时，他们又说，人民民主专政既已是无产阶级专政了，还要什么无产阶级专政呢？因而实质上又是取消了社会主义革命。这样，既反对了毛主席所说“中国革命要分两步走”的观点，又反对了毛主席所批判过的“毕其功于一役”的观点。而托洛斯基匪徒早就宣传的中国革命是无产阶级的社会主义革命的反动观点，岂不又是正确的了吗？这样不是把原来就很明确的问题，越弄得糊涂不堪了吗？
    同志，我写得太噜苏了，恐会耽误你们的时间，暂不写下去了。这个问题，我们学校没讨论过，我的意见中错误是难免的，请你们不要客气，来信指正和讨论。  　　　　　　一九四九年九月一日于北平
