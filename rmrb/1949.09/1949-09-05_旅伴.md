　　Part One Night
　　Chapter Three Doctor Bilov
　　“Danilov,” the doctor asked, “are you and your wife on good terms?”
　　“What do you mean?” Danilov asked in surprise. “She’s my wife; what other kind of relationship would there be?…”
　　“No, you see,” he said, looking very embarrassed, “what I mean is… you… oh, in short, sometimes people live together for thirty years, but there's never any real affection – does that ever happen?”
　　Danilov looked away.
　　“Of course that happens…”
　　“But the exact opposite can also happen,” the doctor said, his face suddenly radiant, filled with tenderness, pride, and shy elation; Danilov was utterly astonished.
　　A pale-haired woman, a head taller than the doctor, walked around the end of a row of cars and crossed the tracks. She was wearing an ordinary gray dress and a black straw hat in the style of the 1920s.
　　“Sonya…” the doctor said softly. “I thought you weren’t coming. Danilov, let me introduce you to my wife… her name is Sonya, this is Danilov, I would have been in a bad way without him.”
　　Mrs. Bilov looked at Danilov’s face and shook his hand. In her other hand, she carried a large, bulging mesh bag.
　　“Come, let me show you my compartment…” the doctor said softly, beside himself with happiness. “You alone… give me the bag… oh, of course, you’re alone… always alone, always…”
　　“Igor is digging trenches,” his wife replied, following him. “Lili can’t leave her work. I brought your gloves, Bilov, you forgot your gloves.”
　　“He looks like a young man,” Danilov thought, watching the doctor help his wife into the carriage. The heavy bag had left a red mark on her hand. The hand was full of wrinkles, pale, and thin…
　　The ventilator buzzed in the carriage.
　　The doctor and his wife sat on the sofa. He held her hand, and small packages that had been taken from the bag were placed on the table.
　　“Sonya, don’t you think, we’re sitting here just like we were that night I left home, do you remember? Do you remember me saying that maybe it would be the last time. But now we’re sitting here together like this again, aren’t we? But it’s only been a week and a half, hasn’t it? You know what I was thinking? I was thinking that we will sit together like this many, many more times. What do you think?”
　　She kissed his sweaty forehead and said tenderly:
　　“I think so too. Give me some water to drink. Cold water, pour a lot.”
　　The doctor jumped up, clutching his head:
　　“Darling, I’m sorry! I'm like usual, I didn’t even think! You’ve been working so hard! Running back and forth through the swamps in the forest! Looking for me! Heavens!… There’s water in this bottle, but it’s hot, it’s not refreshing…”
　　Someone knocked on the glass door. Chubby, rosy-cheeked Fenma, wearing a pleated white nurse’s cap, came in daintily with a tray. On the tray were a coffee pot, biscuits, a jug of fruit juice with a piece of ice floating in it. Another face was showing behind Fenma's shoulder. Everyone wanted to get a glimpse of the boss's wife.
　　The doctor laughed with joy.
　　“Sonya, Danilov arranged this! I’m sure Danilov arranged this! Such a man! Fenma, who sent you with this, Danilov?”
　　Fenma poured coffee and answered generously:
　　“The quartermaster said to tell you that the fried pork chops will be ready in ten minutes.”
　　Sonya, wait a while to drink the coffee. You eat the fried pork chops first. Of course, this is Danilov, not the quartermaster. The quartermaster would only give us porridge, only give us porridge… I didn’t even know we had pork. This is Danilov determined to show off in front of you. Such a man! Haha! Such a man!… Fenma, go get the pork chops, go get them, bring them…”
　　The wife wanted him to eat with her. The food was really too hot, she really couldn't eat it, he knew she couldn't eat too much… He didn’t eat, but when she used her fork to give him a piece, he swallowed it, full of joy. No, she had found him, this was simply unspeakable, unspeakable happiness!
　　“How did you find me? If it were me, I really wouldn’t have been able to find you no matter what… Darling, I’m sorry, I keep asking meaningless questions. What was I going to say… yes! No, are they sending you to dig trenches?”
　　“No. They’re not sending me.”
　　“Well, of course, of course. With your health…”
　　“Nobody’s sending me. I’m going myself.”
　　Her face trembled.
　　“The enemy is attacking us, haha, attacking us so fiercely, Bilov…”
　　He glanced at her, at a loss.

    第三章　比洛夫医生
    “达尼洛夫，”医生问道，“你同你太太关系很好吗？”
    “你这什么意思？”达尼洛夫惊奇的问道。“她是太太；还会有什么关系呢？……”
    “不，你晓得，”他很窘的说，“我想问你的是……你……呵，总而言之，有时候人们在一块住了三十年，可是真正的情谊总是没有，——有这样的事吗？”
    达尼洛夫的目光转了过去。
    “当然会有的事……”
    “可是也有恰恰相反的事呢，”医生说着，他的脸忽然发着光辉，带着一片温存，骄傲与害羞的狂喜；达尼洛夫真是万分惊奇了。
    一个苍白头发的，比医生高一头的女子，绕过旁边一列的车尾，跨过了铁轨。她穿着一件普通的灰色衣服，戴了一顶二十年代式样的黑草帽。
    “梭妮……”医生轻轻的说。“我想你已经不来了。达尼洛夫，让我来把我的太太给你介绍一下吧……她叫梭妮，这是达尼洛夫，要不是他，我会糟了呢。”
    比太太把达尼洛夫的脸望了一眼，同他握了手。另一只手里提着一只装得鼓腾腾的很大的网眼提袋。
    “来，我带你来看看我的车厢……”医生低声说着，幸福得不知所措了。“你一人……把提袋给我……呵，当然你只一个人……从来一个人，从来……”
    “伊戈尔在挖战壕的，”太太跟在他后面回答着。“莉莉离不开工作。我把手套给你带来了，比洛夫，你把手套忘了。”
    “你瞧，他活象一个青年人，”达尼洛夫想着，望着医生把太太扶到车里坐着。沉重的提袋，把她的手勒了一道红印痕。那手满是皱纹，苍白，干瘦………
    通风机在车里嗡嗡的响着。
    医生同太太坐在沙发上。他握着她手，桌上放着从提袋里掏出来的小包。
    “梭妮，你觉得吗，我们现在就好象我离家的那天晚上一样的坐着，你记得吗？你记得我当时说这或许是最后一次了。可是现在我们又一块儿这样坐着了，不是吗？可是总共只过了一个半礼拜，不是吗？你知道我在想什么呢？我想我们将在一起这样坐好多好多次呢。你觉得怎么样？”
    她到他汗湿的额颅上吻了一下，温存的说：
    “我也是这样想的。给我一点水喝吧。冷水，多倒一点。”
    医生跳起来，抱着头：
    “亲爱的，对不起！我象平常一样，一点也没想到！你辛苦了！在森林的沼泽地里来回乱跑着！寻找着我！天呵！……这水瓶里有水，不过是热的，不利口……”
    有人在玻璃镜的门上敲着。胖胖的，双颊绯红的芬玛，戴着打褶的白护士帽，端着托盘，娇滴滴的进来。托盘里放着咖啡壶，饼干，装着果子露的水罐，水罐里漂着一块冰。还有一个人的脸，在芬玛肩后露着。大家都想瞻仰一下上司太太的风采呢。
    医生欢喜得大笑起来了。
    “梭妮，这是达尼洛夫弄的！我断定这是达尼洛夫弄的！这样的人呵！芬玛，这是谁打发你送的，达尼洛夫吗？”
    芬玛倒着咖啡，大大方方的回答道：
    “军需官叫告诉说，再过十分钟，炸猪排就弄好了。”
    梭妮，你等一会喝咖啡。你先吃炸猪排。这当然是达尼洛夫，不是军需官弄的。军需官只会给我们稀饭吃，只会给稀饭吃……我甚至连知道都不知道我们有猪肉。这是达尼洛夫决心要在你面前露一手呢。这样的人呵！呵哈！这样的人呵！……芬玛，去端猪排去吧，去端来，端来……”
    太太希望他同她一起吃。吃菜真是太热了，她真不能吃，他明知道她是不能多吃的……他不吃，可是当她用叉子给他叉一块的时候，他满心欢喜的就接着吞了。不，她找着了他，这简直是不可言喻的，不可言喻的幸福呵！
    “你怎么还找着了呢？要是我，真无论如何也找不到了……亲爱的，对不起，我尽问些没意思的事。我要说什么呢……是了！不，派你去挖战壕吗？”
    “不。不派我呢。”
    “唔，当然的，当然的。你这样的身体……”
    “谁也不派我去。我自己去。”
    她的脸发颤起来。
    “敌人攻打我们的，呵哈，攻打得多利害呵，比洛夫……”
    他不知所措的对她望了一眼。　　　　　　　　　　　　　（未完）
