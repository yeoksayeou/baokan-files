　　China Women's Federation Peiping Branch
  　Denounces US Imperialist White Paper
  　Resolves to Strengthen Vigilance Against Aggressive Conspiracies
    [This City News] The Peiping Branch of the All-China Women's Federation has recently issued a denunciation of the US imperialist White Paper, the text of which is as follows: Imperialists always feign benevolence and righteousness and are unwilling to tell the truth. They always try to conceal and cover up their aggressive acts in every possible way. However, this time, in the White Paper, US imperialism has unusually openly exposed many facts of US imperialism's long-term aggression against China and has helplessly admitted the failure of its aid to Chiang. But it has not given up and still expresses its conspiratorial determination to continue to undermine the Chinese revolution. Such a White Paper provides excellent educational material for the so-called "democratic individualists" whom US imperialism is attempting to use, enabling those who are still confused to wake up, abandon illusions, and engage in struggle. We sisters of the Women's Federation have long recognized the hideous face of US imperialism and will never harbor any illusions about it. We will never forget the hatred of US imperialists for humiliating our women. Chairman Mao said: "The imperialists and their running dogs, the Chinese reactionaries, will not be reconciled to their defeat on this land of China." Therefore, we will never relax our vigilance against any aggressive conspiracies of US imperialism. We vow to stand firmly with the people of the whole country, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, on the side of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, and to fight to the end for the liberation of all the Chinese people and the victory of the construction of the new China.

　　中国妇女联谊会北平分会
  　斥美帝白皮书
  　决加强对侵略阴谋的警惕
    【本市讯】中国妇女联谊会北平分会顷发表对美帝国主义白皮书的斥责，文如下：帝国主义者总是假仁假义，不肯说实话，对于侵略行为，从来是百般遮藏掩盖。然而这次美帝国主义在白皮书中，却超乎常轨地公开暴露了美帝长期侵略中国的许多事实，并且无可奈何地招认了援蒋的失败。但它并未死心，仍然表示继续破坏中国革命的阴谋决心。这样的白皮书，对于美帝国主义者所企图利用的所谓“民主个人主义者”提供了极好的教育材料，使那些还是迷糊的人们清醒过来，丢掉幻想，进行斗争。我们妇联的姊妹们早就认清了美帝国主义的狰狞面目，对它决不抱任何幻想，美帝国主义者凌辱我们妇女的仇恨，我们是永远不会忘记的。毛主席说：“帝国主义者及其走狗中国反动派对于他们在中国这块土地上的失败，是不会甘心的。”因此，我们决不放松对于美帝国主义任何侵略阴谋的警惕性。我们誓与全国人民一道，在中国共产党的领导下，坚决站在以苏联为首的和平民主阵营一边，为争取全中国人民的解放和新中国建设的胜利，奋斗到底。
