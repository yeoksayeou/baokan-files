　　Starting with Small Things, Talk About Style
  　Reading Notes XI
    Ya Qun
    Probably, some people haven't seen it; some people have seen it but don't consider it a big deal. We have repeatedly published "Notes for Contributors," but to this day, we still often receive submissions that are "written on both sides of the paper," "written horizontally," with "tiny, sesame-seed-sized characters," "using ×× to replace people's names, place names, and dates," written in a crowded and illegible manner, or written in "cursive and simplified characters"!
    Comrades who have not been involved in, or do not understand, the work of editing, typesetting, and proofreading may not appreciate the difficulties that the above-mentioned "small things" cause for editing, typesetting, and proofreading, which is understandable; but as a matter of personal style, it is worth noting. Because this kind of style, more or less, is a manifestation of a lack of mass perspective. The most prominent example is: the signatures on some manuscripts are often in a signature-style font. Generally speaking, this type of font is only recognizable to oneself and one's closest friends, and it is really not suitable for submissions. Sometimes, after research, speculation, and "negotiation" by the editing, typesetting, and proofreading departments, we determine a pen name, but after it is printed, it is still "ambiguous"! (For example, "Hai Tao" is printed as "Hai Ke," "Zhu Ke Yu" is printed as "@ Yu"...)
    Secondly, some comrades write "If it is not suitable, please revise and return it" at the end of their manuscripts, but their paper is already written so densely that there is no room for anyone to make corrections!
    All these "small things," generally speaking, are doing things according to one's own "customary law," without considering whether the objective reality is feasible. This matter is small, but it can be magnified. It is best to consider the objective situation before dealing with every matter, such as writing a word, also putting oneself in the shoes of the typesetter and thinking: If I were a typesetter, would I recognize this way of writing? That would be good.

### 从小事谈作风　读稿杂记之十一

　　从小事谈作风
  　读稿杂记之十一

    大概，有些人是因为没有看见；有些人是因为看见了没有把它当作一回事。我们一再刊登“来稿注意”，但到今天为止，“一纸写两面”的，“横写”的，写“芝麻大的字”的，“用××代替人名地名和年月日”的，写得拥挤不堪的，写“草字简笔字”的，仍然常常有！
    在没有搞过，或不了解编、排、校的工作的同志们，对于上例的那些“小事”给予编、排、校工作的困难，是体会不到的，不足为怪；但作为一个人的作风问题来说，却值得注意。因为这种作风，或多或少是缺乏群众观点的表现。最突出的例子是：有些文稿上的署名，往往是签字式的字体。一般说来，这种字体，是只有自己和自己底最密切的朋友，才辨认得出的，用之于投稿，实在不适宜。我们有时经过编、排、校，三方面的研究，揣测，“协商”，才确定一个笔名，而印出之后仍然是“似是而非”！（如把“海滔”印成“海渴”，“竹可羽”印成“＠羽”……）。
    其次是有些同志在稿末写上“如不合用，希望修改寄还”，可是他的稿纸已经写得密不通风，使人无从插手了！
    所有这些“小事”，总的说来，都是凭自己底“习惯法”办事，没有考虑客观的实际行不行得通。此事虽小，可以放大。最好，处理每一件事之前，都能考虑一下客观的情况，比如写一个字，也设身处地的想一想：假如我是排字工人，这样写法，我认不认得呢？那就好了。
