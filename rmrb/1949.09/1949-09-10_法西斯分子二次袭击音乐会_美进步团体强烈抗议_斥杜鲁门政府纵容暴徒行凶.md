Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 8th: New York dispatch: The second organized fascist attack on the Robeson concert in New York State has aroused the anger of the American people. The sponsor of the concert, the Civil Rights Congress, sent a telegram to Truman on the 5th, expressing strong protests. The telegram criticized New York State Governor Dewey for his irresponsibility in safeguarding civil rights, which can only be interpreted as an attack by Dewey on people of color. At the same time, the "Committee to Protest the Peekskill Atrocities," composed of leaders of well-known American progressive groups, has issued a statement demanding the removal of police officers who connived with fascists in their atrocities and the arrest and prosecution of the leaders of veterans' organizations who participated in the atrocities. Paul Robeson, the singer and fighter of the American people, also held a press conference on the 6th, denouncing the thugs who participated in the attack as "stormtroopers of the future supported by powerful financial forces." Robeson said that the reason why more than a hundred concertgoers were injured "is because the police, who pretended to be protecting us, were attacking and assaulting us. We were attacked by the armed forces of the state and local governments." Paul O'Dwyer, chairman of the New York branch of the National Association, also sent a telegram to Dewey, denouncing "organized forces using violence in Peekskill."

According to the United Press, the thugs who attacked the Robeson concert committed violence for as long as five hours. According to hospital statistics, 138 people were injured. The United Press also said that many of those who participated in the violence were "wearing uniforms of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and veterans' organizations." A small number of the arrested murderers were released after paying bail of 35 to 500 yuan.

　　法西斯分子二次袭击音乐会
  　美进步团体强烈抗议
    斥杜鲁门政府纵容暴徒行凶
    【新华社北平八日电】纽约讯：美国纽约州法西斯分子第二次有组织地袭击罗伯逊音乐会的暴行，引起美国人民的愤怒。音乐会的主持者———民权保障大会于五日致电杜鲁门，表示强烈的抗议。该电斥责纽约州州长杜威对保障民权的不负责任，只能解释为杜威对有色人民的一种攻击。同时，由著名的美国进步团体领袖所组成的“抗议毕克斯吉尔暴行委员会”已发出声明，要求将纵容法西斯分子行凶的警官撤职，逮捕与起诉参加暴行的退伍军人团体的首领。美国人民的歌手与斗士罗伯逊，亦于六日举行记者招待会，痛斥参加袭击的暴徒“是由有权势的金融势力所支持的未来的突击队”。罗伯逊说：音乐会听众之所以有百余人受伤，“是因为佯装来保护我们的警察，都在攻打和袭击我们，我们是被州和地方政府的武力所袭击”。全国协会纽约分会主席保罗·奥德维耶亦致电杜威，斥责“有组织的势力在毕克斯吉尔使用暴力”。
    据合众社消息，袭击罗伯逊音乐会的暴徒们，行凶共达五小时之久。据医院方面统计，受伤者达一百三十八人。合众社又称：许多参加暴行的人都“身穿陆、海、空军及退伍军人团的制服”。少数被捕的凶手，竟于缴纳三十五元至五百元的保证金后全被释放。
