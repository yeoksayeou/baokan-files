Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, August 8th: The people's governments in various parts of Central China have successively organized massive manpower to restore transportation, achieving great results. This has made significant contributions to supporting the southern front and connecting material exchanges between the north and south, and between urban and rural areas. Regarding railway restoration: The southern section of the Pinghan Railway, from Xinxiang in the north to Hankou in the south, was fully opened to traffic in August. The restoration project of this section of the railway was extremely large. In the 271 kilometers between Xinxiang and Zhumadian alone, 146 bridges were repaired. Including roadbed repairs, a total of 248,000 railway workers, laborers, and railway corps of the Ministry of Railways participated, taking 65 days. Currently, there are ten pairs of trains running daily between Hankou and Zhengzhou on the Pinghan Railway. The Longhai Railway began construction after the liberation of Kaifeng and Zhengzhou. Now, nearly 500 kilometers of the line between Luoyang and Lianyungang are unobstructed. A total of 68 large and small bridges were repaired, with the participation of 24,900 workers and laborers, taking 47 days. The Yuehan Railway was opened to Puchi on August 1st, with five bridges repaired. Nine of the ten bridges along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi and Nanchang-Jiujiang Railways that were destroyed by the Kuomintang bandit troops have been repaired. Currently, the Nanchang-Jiujiang Railway is fully open to traffic except for the need for ferries at Shaxiadu. The Liangjiadu Bridge on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway in Nanchang was repaired on the 21st of last month, making it possible to travel directly from Nanchang to Hangzhou.

Regarding highway repairs: Henan Province originally had 6,271 kilometers of highways, of which 3,776 kilometers were destroyed by the Japanese invaders and 2,485 kilometers were destroyed by the Kuomintang bandit troops. Currently, 2,041 kilometers have been repaired, including 633 bridges. A total of 501,300 employees and laborers participated. The three major north-south highway lines within Henan Province are now unobstructed, greatly facilitating military transport and freight transport. Before liberation, Hubei Province had more than 4,300 kilometers of open highways and 961 bridges, most of which were destroyed by the Chiang Kai-shek and Bai Chongxi bandit gangs. After repairs, a total of eleven lines are now open to traffic, with a total length of 1,536 kilometers, and 70 bridges have been repaired. A total of 23,300 employees, laborers, and field army engineers participated in the repairs. Centered on Nanchang, Jiangxi Province has now repaired and opened a total of 1,490 kilometers of highways, including the north-south trunk line from Nanchang to Ganzhou, which is more than 300 li long. In July alone, under the leadership of the Provincial Highway Bureau, 67 bridges were repaired. Highways in Hunan Province are still being actively repaired due to the later liberation. Currently, 550 kilometers have been opened to traffic, including Changsha to Changde and Liuyang.

Regarding the restoration of air routes: The destruction of air routes and ships by the Japanese invaders and Chiang Kai-shek bandits was even worse than that of railways and highways. However, after two months of effort in July and August, the routes from Hankou to Shashi, Yichang, Nanjing, Shanghai, Changsha, and the Jiujiang-Nanchang line have been restored, with a total length of 3,249 nautical miles. Civilian ships can also travel unhindered from Hankou to Xiangfan and Hankou to Changde.

　　经八十万军民积极抢修
  　华中水陆交通畅通
  　铁路公路航路大部恢复
    【新华社汉口八日电】华中各地人民政府先后组织了巨大的人力进行恢复交通的工作，取得了很大成绩，对于支援南方前线和沟通南北及城乡间的物资交流都作了巨大贡献。在修复铁路方面：北起新乡、南至汉口的平汉路南段已于八月全部通车。这一段铁路的修复工程极为浩大。仅新乡到驻马店二百七十一公里间即修复了桥梁一百四十六座，连修复路基在内，共参加铁路职工和民工及铁道部铁路纵队共二十四万八千余人，费时六十五日。现平汉路汉口、郑州间每日对开列车十次。陇海路自开封、郑州解放后即开始修建，现洛阳与连云港间近五百公里线路已畅行无阻。前后共修复大小桥梁六十八座，参加职工民工共两万四千九百余人，费时四十七天。粤汉路八月一日已通至蒲圻，修复桥梁五座。浙赣、南浔两铁路沿线被国民党匪军破坏的十座桥梁中，已修复了九座。现南浔路除山下渡尚需摆渡外，已全部通车。浙赣路南昌梁家渡大桥已于上月二十一日修复后，已可自南昌直达杭州。
    在抢修公路方面：河南省公路原有六千二百七十一公里，其中被日寇破坏三千七百七十六公里，被国民党匪军破坏二千四百八十五公里，现已修复二千零四十一公里，包括修复桥梁六百三十三座。参加员工、民工共五十万一千三百余人。现河南境内自北而南的三大公路干线已畅通无阻，大大地便利了军运和货运。湖北省解放前通车公路有四千三百余公里，桥梁九百六十一座，大部被蒋白匪帮破坏。经过抢修，现已通车者共十一线，全长一千五百三十六公里，修好桥梁七十座。参加抢修的员工、民工和野战军工兵共计二万三千三百余人。江西省公路以南昌为中心，现已修复通车者共计一千四百九十公里。其中有贯通南北的南昌至赣州干线三百余里。仅在省公路局领导下七月份内即修复桥梁六十七座。湖南省公路，因解放较晚，尚在积极赶修中。现已通车者计长沙至常德、浏阳等处共五百五十公里。
    恢复航线方面：日寇和蒋匪对航线船只的破坏比对铁路公路更甚。但经过七、八两个月的努力，汉口到沙市、宜昌、南京、上海、长沙各级及九江南昌线已告恢复，共长三千二百四十九海里。由汉口至襄樊、汉口至常德，民船亦已通行无阻。
