After the section received an order from the Telegraph Bureau on August 30th to complete the addition of eight lines on the East Trunk Line within three days, although manpower was insufficient, the workers' awareness improved, eliminating the disunity of the past where they did not help each other. They obtained the participation of six workers from other work areas. Starting work on September 1st, two shifts of copper wire and rubber wire were dispatched every day, totaling seventeen people. During the work, the workers launched a competition to ensure the completion of the task on schedule.

Initially, it was estimated that 65 workdays would be needed, but only 51 workdays were used.

    平津路局北平电务段，工人突击竞赛完成架线任务。该段于八月三十日接到电务局三天内完成东干线添架八条线的施工令后，虽然人力不够，但因工人觉悟提高，消除了过去互不协助的不团结现象，他们争取了其他工区六名工人参加。由九月一日开工，每天出动架铜线与胶线两班共十七名，在工作当中工友们展开了竞赛，保证按期完成任务，尤其最后一天架胶皮线的工人连中午饭都顾不得吃，终于九月三日下午四点提前完成。起初讨论需要六十五工，结果仅用五十一工。
