Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 4th: Moscow dispatch: Soviet newspapers published articles congratulating the opening of the Second World Congress of Democratic Youth in Budapest, Hungary, on September 2nd. The Moscow Communist Youth League newspaper published an article on the 1st by Pogatelev, Vice Chairman of the Soviet Youth Anti-Fascist Committee, stating: The World Federation of Democratic Youth symbolizes the growing unity of democratic youth. The program and practical activities of the Federation have been severely tested since its establishment. The Youth Conference of Southeast Asian Colonies and Dependent Countries, held in Calcutta in February 1948, united democratic youth to fight for national independence, people's freedom, and against foreign imperialism and domestic reactionaries. The Latin American Youth Conference, hosted by the World Federation of Democratic Youth, also put forward the slogan of strengthening the unity of youth in the struggle for national independence, people's freedom, and against U.S. imperialism. Over the past four years, the World Federation of Democratic Youth has become a strong fighting organization of democratic youth. The World Federation of Democratic Youth is connected with 53 million young people in 60 countries by inseparable bonds of friendship. The victory of the World Federation of Democratic Youth angered the American and British imperialists. They attempted to establish international youth organizations to counter the World Federation of Democratic Youth, but these attempts failed. The World Federation of Democratic Youth and progressive youth organizations in various countries are determined to fight against the efforts of imperialists to launch new wars. They condemned the North Atlantic Treaty and declared their determination to fight for the cause of peace. In France, Italy, Norway, Germany, Sweden, Finland, Canada, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Bulgaria, and other countries, they have held conferences, collected signatures, and passed resolutions against the North Atlantic Treaty. Soviet youth and their pioneers—the Lenin Stalin Communist Youth League—are the advanced ranks of all freedom-loving youth in the world. Inspired by the policy of peace and friendship among nations pursued by the Soviet government under the leadership of Comrade Stalin, Soviet youth are consolidating and expanding cooperation with foreign democratic youth organizations. Pogatelev concluded: Undoubtedly, the Second Youth Congress will be another powerful demonstration of the determination of democratic youth to strengthen unity and strengthen the struggle for consolidating lasting peace.
    The News reported on the 2nd, publishing an article by Jiulin, stating: The past four years have been years of severe tests and struggles. In the course of this struggle, the strength of the democratic youth united by the World Federation of Democratic Youth has grown and become more united. The youth vowed to stand with the people of the Soviet Union—the socialist motherland—and fight with all their strength against the instigators of new wars. The World Federation of Democratic Youth provides tremendous assistance to the youth of colonial and dependent countries. These youth, together with their people, are fighting for national freedom and independence against colonial oppression. The World Federation of Democratic Youth has aroused the working youth to fight against the Marshall Plan and against the exploitation of child and youth labor by capitalists. Shocked by the growing scope of the Federation's activities, the imperialist reactionaries launched a crusade against democratic youth. Encouraged by Wall Street, the U.S. authorities persecuted the leaders of the democratic youth movement. The Vatican fiercely threatened young Catholics with excommunication if they were associated with the Federation or progressive national youth organizations. The British Labour Party threatened to expel young people if they cooperated with the World Federation of Democratic Youth. The despicable fascist Tito clique of Yugoslavia also joined the reactionary crusade against democratic youth. Jiulin continued: The youth of the people's democratic countries are participating in the Second World Youth Congress with remarkable success. In Bulgaria, Poland, Romania, and Czechoslovakia, unified mass youth organizations have been established, and in Hungary and Albania, the establishment of such unified organizations is nearing completion. Inspired by the great ideas of Lenin and Stalin, the Soviet youth, as in the past, will stand at the forefront of the fighters for peace and friendship among nations, and will spare no effort to work selflessly for the welfare of their great motherland, holding high the banner of proletarian internationalism for the victory of communism.

　　世界民主青年团结更紧密  誓与苏联一起反对侵略者
  　苏联报纸祝贺大会开幕
    【新华社北平四日电】莫斯科讯：苏联报纸发表专文祝贺九月二日起在匈京布达佩斯开幕的世界民主青年第二次代表大会。莫斯科共产主义青年团报于一日发表苏联青年反法西斯委员会副主席波加捷列夫论文称：世界民主青联象征着民主青年的日益增长的团结。青联的纲领和实际活动，在它成立以来已经受过严重考验。一九四八年二月在加尔各答举行的东南亚殖民地和附属国青年代表会议，团结民主青年为民族独立、人民自由、反对外国帝国主义和国内反动派而斗争。由世界民主青年所主持的拉丁美洲青年代表会议，也提出了加强青年们在争取民族独立、人民自由、反对美帝国主义斗争中的团结的口号。世界青联四年来已成为民主青年强固的战斗组织。世界民主青联以不可分离的友谊纽带与六十个国家的五千三百万青年联系着。世界民主青年联盟的胜利使美英帝国主义者发怒了。他们曾企图建立与世界青联抗衡的国际青年组织，但这些企图都失败了。世界民主青联和各国的进步青年组织决心为反对帝国主义者发动新战争的努力而斗争。他们谴责北大西洋公约并宣称他们决心为和平的事业而斗争。在法、意、挪、德、瑞典、芬、加、捷、波、保及其他等国，他们曾举行大会，征集签名并通过决议，反对北大西洋公约。苏联青年及其先锋队——列宁斯大林共产主义青年团，是世界上全体爱好自由的青年的先进队伍。为斯大林同志领导下的苏联政府所遵循的和平与各国间友谊的政策所鼓舞，苏联青年巩固与扩大着和外国民主青年团体的合作。波加捷列夫结语称：无疑的，第二届青年代表大会将为民主青年决心加强团结、加强争取巩固与持久和平之斗争的又一强大的示威。
    消息报于二日发表鸠林的论文称：过去的四年是严重的考验和斗争的年代。在这一斗争的过程中，世界民主青联所团结的民主青年底力量业已增长而且团结得更加紧密了。青年们立誓要和苏联社会主义的祖国——的人民在一起，全力与新战争的挑拨者斗争。世界民主青联给予殖民地与附属国家的青年以巨大的帮助。这些青年和他们的人民一起，进行着争取民族自由与独立，反对殖民压迫的斗争。世界民主青联唤起劳动青年进行反对马歇尔计划。反对资本家对儿童及青年劳动的剥削的斗争。为青联活动范围的日益增大所震惊，帝国主义反动派发动了反民主青年的十字军。在华尔街的鼓励下，美国当局迫害着民主青年运动的领袖。梵蒂冈气势汹汹地在年青的天主教徒面前恫吓着要把凡与青联或进步的全国性青年组织有联系的青年教徒逐出教外。英国工党威胁着要开除那些青年人，假如他们和世界民主青联合作的话。南斯拉夫的可鄙的法西斯的铁托集团，也参加了反动派这支反对民主青年的十字军。鸠林继称：人民民主国家的青年带着很值得注意的成功来参加第二届世界青年代表大会。在保加利亚、波兰、罗马尼亚和捷克斯洛伐克，已建立了统一的群众性的青年组织，在匈牙利与阿尔巴尼亚，这样统一的组织之建立，正接近于完成。受到列宁与斯大林伟大的思想所感召的苏维埃青年，将一如过去一样地站在为和平与民族间的友谊而斗争的斗士的前列，并将为了共产主义的胜利而高举无产阶级国际主义的大旗，不遗余力地为他们伟大的祖国的福利而忘我地劳动。
