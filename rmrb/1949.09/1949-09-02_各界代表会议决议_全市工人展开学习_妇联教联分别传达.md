　　Resolutions of the People's Representative Conference
  　Citywide Workers Launch Study
  　Women's Federation and Education Union Separately Convey
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The work of conveying the resolutions of the People's Representative Conference has continued to deepen throughout the city. Over the past week, workers and shop employees in all factories and industries across the city have been enthusiastically studying the resolutions and various reports from the People's Representative Conference. Initially, representatives from each unit who attended the conference gave simple briefings. Subsequently, the study was expanded among the workers using a combination of large-scale centralized briefings and small-group discussions. The First Repair Shop and the Trolley Company even drafted discussion outlines or raised questions for separate discussions. The Sixth District conducted the briefings in conjunction with teaching at workers' night schools. The General Garment Factory had its attending representatives mimeograph and distribute information about their participation in the conference for workers to discuss. Workers in all factories unanimously expressed their support for the conference resolutions. After studying the resolutions, workers at the Trolley Company immediately proposed a streamlining and economy drive and decided to run propaganda trolleys to assist in publicity. Representatives of the various women's groups in the preparatory committee of the Municipal Women's Federation have recently been conveying the resolutions and launching discussions on how to translate the resolutions from the conference into action. Representatives from the Qinghua Family Women's Association have given three briefings, emphasizing the current importance of developing production. After the meetings, each production team is now studying and formulating production plans to strengthen production work. The Beijing branch of the Chinese Women's Friendship Association, after convening members to convey the resolutions, also discussed and passed a proclamation denouncing the U.S. Imperialist White Paper. The Municipal Federation of Primary and Secondary School Teachers and Staff held a meeting on the 28th of last month at the Municipal No. 8 Middle School with more than three thousand people to convey the resolutions. Deputy Director Hou of the Education Bureau also attended and spoke. Many teachers and staff members spoke at the meeting, unanimously expressing their determination to implement the resolutions of the People's Representative Conference, and to run worker's children's education and adult literacy education well, to answer the hopes of the people of the city.
