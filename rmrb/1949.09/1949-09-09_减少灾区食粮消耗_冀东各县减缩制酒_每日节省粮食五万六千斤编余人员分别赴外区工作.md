　　Reducing Food Consumption in Disaster Areas
  　Jidong Counties Reduce and Curtail Wine Production
    Saving 56,000 Jin of Grain Daily; Surplus Personnel to Work in Other Areas
    [Tangshan Electricity] In order to reduce food consumption in disaster areas, the Jidong Wine Industry Company has been ordered to reduce and curtail wine production and organize surplus employees to produce in other areas. The Jidong Wine Industry Company originally had jurisdiction over 25 wineries, with a total of 42 stills for wine production, producing 30,000 jin of wine daily, requiring more than 95,000 jin of grain. This summer, many areas of Jidong suffered from wind, water, hail, and insect disasters, and the autumn harvest will inevitably be reduced. In order to supplement the food shortage in the Jidong area, the company has recently received instructions from the North China Finance Department and the Wine Industry Head Office to reduce to nine factories with seventeen stills. In this way, 13,000 jin of wine can be produced daily, and the grain required is reduced to 39,000 jin, saving 56,000 jin of grain daily. There are also plans to purchase rice bran from the Northeast, or use bad grain as a substitute. For the more than 300 surplus winemaking employees, they are being mobilized to produce in other areas. The more than 300 employees are divided into three large teams according to region: Fengrun, Yutian (part), and Zunhua, a large team of 80 people going to Tianjin; Changli, Luanxian, Leting, and Funing, a large team of 80 people going to Suiyuan; Jixian, Baodi, Tongxian, and Yutian, a large team of 160 people going to Chahar. The first batch of more than 100 people are scheduled to depart on September 5th, carrying one million jin of funds, winemaking furniture, livestock vehicles, and other items to their designated locations to engage in construction preparation work, and the second batch will depart on the 10th. The company has now transferred the four million jin of sorghum stored in the factories to the local county governments to enrich military and civilian food supplies.

　　减少灾区食粮消耗
  　冀东各县减缩制酒
    每日节省粮食五万六千斤编余人员分别赴外区工作
    【唐山电】为了减少灾区食粮消耗，冀东酒业公司奉命减缩制酒，并组织编余职工赴外区生产。冀东酒业公司原辖有制酒厂二十五处，共四十二个甑制酒，日产酒三万斤，需食粮九万五千余斤。今夏冀东很多地区遭受了风、水、雹、虫灾，秋收必将减产，为了补充冀东区食粮的不足，该公司近奉华北财政部及酒业总公司的指示，减为九厂十七个甑制酒，这样每日可产酒一万三千斤，所需粮食则减为三万九千斤，每日可节出五万六千斤食粮，并计划将来到东北购买米糠，或用坏粮食代用。对于编余的三百余名制酒职工，则动员他们到外区去生产，三百余名职工按地域分成三个大队，计：丰润、玉田（一部分）遵化一大队八十人赴天津，昌黎、滦县、乐亭、抚宁一大队八十人赴绥远，蓟县、宝坻、通县、玉田一大队一百六十人赴察哈尔。首批百余名订于九月五日携带资金米百万斤，制酒家具、牲畜车辆等物分赴各指定地点，从事建设准备工作，二批继于十日出发。现该公司已将各厂所存红粮四百万斤分别移交当地县政府，以充裕军需民食。
