　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 29th: The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference today unanimously passed a resolution to have the soon-to-be-established Central People's Government send a telegram to the United Nations General Assembly, declaring that the People's Republic of China has been established, that the Central People's Government elected by the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is the only government that can represent the Chinese people, and denying the credentials of all representatives sent to the United Nations meeting by the pseudo-government of the reactionary remnants in Guangzhou. This is a solemn declaration by the Chinese people to the whole world in the capacity of masters of the country, which fully conforms to the actual situation of the fundamentally changed Chinese political situation and reflects the common will and aspirations of the entire Chinese people.
　　The Kuomintang reactionaries, running dogs of American imperialism, have been abandoned by the entire Chinese people for implementing a policy of selling out the country, civil war, and dictatorship. The People's Liberation War and the People's Great Revolution led by the Chinese Communist Party have achieved a decisive victory nationwide because they have won the support of the entire Chinese people. The reactionary Nanjing Kuomintang government perished as early as April this year when the People's Liberation Army crossed the Yangtze River, and the Kuomintang bandit remnants fleeing in southern China will also be completely wiped out by the victorious Chinese People's Liberation Army in a short period of time. The remaining reactionary groups in Guangzhou, Taiwan, and other places are no longer a government, but only a combination of a small group of hooligans and bandits, and they absolutely do not have the qualifications to represent the Chinese people.
　　The presence of Jiang Tingfu, a representative of the Guangzhou bandit group, in the United Nations General Assembly is not only an insult to the Chinese people, but also damages the United Nations organization itself. The United Nations is an organization of countries that guarantees world peace and security after World War II, but since the thief Jiang is not qualified to represent a country, he still uses the podium of the United Nations General Assembly to carry out slanders and sabotage, dares to reverse black and white, confuse the public, slander the Chinese people and China's friendly country the Soviet Union, and requests the United Nations General Assembly to "consider" the situation in China, attempting to attract the imperialists who control the majority of the United Nations countries to further interfere in China's internal affairs. This is intolerable to the Chinese people. Therefore, we fully support the resolution of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and demand that the United Nations General Assembly immediately stop all the criminal activities of Jiang Tingfu and other Kuomintang bandit representatives at the conference, and immediately revoke the credentials of any representatives of the Kuomintang reactionary government.

### 中国人民对全世界的庄严宣告

　　中国人民对全世界的庄严宣告
    中国人民政治协商会议今天全体一致通过决议，由即将成立的中央人民政府致电联合国大会，声明中华人民共和国业已成立，中国人民政治协商会议所选举之中央人民政府为唯一能代表中国人民的政府，并否认广州反动残余势力伪政府所派出席联合国会议所有代表的代表资格。这是中国人民以国家主人翁资格对全世界的庄严宣告，完全符合于业已根本变化了的中国政治情势的实际情况，反映了全中国人民的共同意志和愿望。
    美国帝国主义走狗国民党反动派，由于执行卖国内战独裁政策，已为全中国人民所共弃。而中国共产党所领导的人民解放战争和人民大革命，则由于获得了全中国人民的拥护，已在全国范围内取得了决定的胜利。南京国民党反动政府远在今年四月人民解放军渡过长江时即已灭亡，流窜华南的国民党残匪，亦即将在短时期内被胜利进军中的中国人民解放军扫荡净尽。目前的广州、台湾等地的残余反动集团，已经不成为一个政府，而只是一小撮流氓土匪的结合，绝对没有代表中国人民的资格。
    广州土匪集团代表蒋廷黻的厕身联合国大会，不仅是对于中国人民的污辱，而且也有损于联合国组织本身。联合国是第二次世界大战以后各国保障世界和平与安全的组织，而蒋贼既无资格代表一个国家，竟仍然利用联合国大会的讲坛进行诽谤和捣乱，胆敢颠倒黑白，淆惑听闻，诽谤中国人民和中国友邦苏联，并要求联合国大会“考虑”中国的局势，企图吸引控制着联合国多数国家的帝国主义者进一步地干涉中国内政，这是中国人民所不能容忍的。因此，我们完全拥护中国人民政治协商会议的决议，要求联合国大会立即停止蒋廷黻和其他国民党匪帮代表在大会上的一切罪恶活动，并立即取销国民党反动政府任何代表的代表资格。
