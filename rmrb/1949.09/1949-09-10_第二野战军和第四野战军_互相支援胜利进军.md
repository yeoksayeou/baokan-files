　　Second Field Army and Fourth Field Army
  　Supporting Each Other in Victorious Advance
    [Report from this newspaper] On the Central China front, the People's Liberation Army's Second Field Army and Fourth Field Army, two fraternal units fighting shoulder to shoulder, are learning from each other, taking care of each other, and helping each other overcome difficulties in the continued great advance. They are demonstrating the unparalleled closeness and solidarity of revolutionary troops in the revolutionary family. The CCP Central China Bureau and the Central China Military Region specially organized a "Support the Second Field Army Committee," with Commander Lin Biao personally serving as the director. The Fourth Field Army and the organs, troops, cadres, and soldiers at all levels in Central China have provided thoughtful spiritual and material care for the Second Field Army troops passing through. Along the Second Field Army's advance route, grain stations and hot water stations were set up. The grain stations were fully stocked with oil, salt, vegetables, and other provisions. Slogans were posted everywhere, and colorful arches, propaganda sheds, and broadcasting stations were set up to warmly welcome and send off the troops with singing and slogans. The people along the way also lined up to warmly welcome them. The Second Field Army soldiers happily said: Only revolutionary troops have such warmth! The Second Field Army troops also showed the same friendship and solidarity to the Fourth Field Army troops who were jointly advancing and cooperating in combat. The soldiers voluntarily gave up their houses and mosquito nets to their Fourth Field Army comrades. They also boiled water and gave cigarettes to the Fourth Field Army comrades, and gave their horses to sick Fourth Field Army soldiers to ride. The leaders of the Second Field Army also instructed the various corps and armies, calling on all commanders and fighters of the field army to coordinate with the fraternal units through resolute advancing actions, completely eliminate and annihilate the enemy, and complete the glorious task of liberating all of China, in order to respond to the warm support and care of the Party, government, military, and people of Central China for the Second Field Army troops. In particular, they called on the entire army to proactively and humbly learn from the Fourth Field Army comrades' experience in military construction and combat when they meet with the Fourth Field Army fraternal units.
