　　Yellow River Water Levels Generally Decrease
    [This newspaper's dispatch] The Yellow River water situation has generally decreased in the past two days. At 8:00 AM on the 19th, Xianyang decreased by 780 cubic meters per second. At 12:00 PM, Tongguan decreased to 3,450, Shanzhou decreased to 7,920, Huayuankou decreased to 5,750, and the Luo and Qin Rivers continued to decrease. The rain across the entire river stopped on the 18th, and the weather cleared on the 19th. According to the water situation at each station, continued decrease is certain. The sustained situation of small increases and small decreases has basically passed. In Shandong, after the breaches of the people's embankments in Shouzhang and Liangshan, the water flow slowed, and the middle and lower reaches generally decreased. On the 18th, Pingyuan also decreased, but the situation of the Jin and Linhuang dikes remains serious. The Jin dike has been experiencing leaks due to long periods of not being exposed to water before the breach of the people's embankments. The Linhuang dike has experienced many collapses due to excessively long periods of immersion. Shouzhang, Pingyuan County, Liangshan, and Dong'a are all relatively serious. The situation in Henan is relatively stable, and the collapsed dams and embankments during the flood period have all been repaired.

　　黄河水位普遍下降
    【本报讯】黄河水情两日以来普遍下降。十九日八时咸阳降七百八十秒公方，十二时潼关降至三千四百五十，陕州降至七千九百二十，花园口降至五千七百五十，洛沁两河仍在续降，十八日全河下雨停止，十九日放晴。根据各站水情估计，继续下降是肯定的，小涨小落的持续形势，基本上业已过去。山东自寿张、梁山民埝溃决后，水势转缓，中下游普遍下降，十八日平原亦下降，但金堤和临黄堤情况仍严重。金堤因民埝溃决前长期未着水，致漏洞层出，临黄堤因浸水期过长，坍陷很多，寿张、平原县、梁山、东阿均较严重，河南较平稳，洪水时期坍塌坝埽均已被修。
