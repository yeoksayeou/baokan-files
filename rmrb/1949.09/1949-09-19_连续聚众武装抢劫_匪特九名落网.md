　　Continuous Gang Armed Robberies
　  Nine Bandit Agents Apprehended
[This City News] Liu Yingnan and eight other Kuomintang special agent bandits, who seriously disrupted revolutionary order and continuously committed gang armed robberies, have been arrested and brought to justice by the No. 1 and No. 3 Public Security Sub-bureaus. Liu Yingnan was originally a Kuomintang Central Statistics Bureau special agent, under the leadership of special agent ringleader Wang Zejiu (currently undergoing reform through labor in the Qinghe Brigade). He worked in the Baling Right Banner Party Headquarters work team in Rehe. After 1947, the criminal transferred to the Kuomintang bandit army, serving successively as the head of the pseudo-Northeast Provisional 3rd Regiment. After the liberation of Northeast China, he was incorporated into the pseudo-North China Military and Political Cadre Training Class for training. At the time of the liberation of Beiping, in order to seek cover, the criminal infiltrated the pseudo-Armored Corps. At that time, he and Yang Zhida and others, the instructors of the corps, planned armed robberies to disrupt revolutionary order. After the pseudo-Armored Corps was reorganized by the People's Liberation Army and sent to Datong, the criminal used the excuse of returning to Beiping for medical treatment for illness and secretly organized Kuomintang bandit army stragglers Yang Zhida, Miao Qingfang, Zhu Maochun (using a rat poison stall in Dongsi as cover), Ma Junlin (using a miscellaneous noodle stall in Dongsi as cover), and bandits Wang Guiqi, E Yisan, Wei Chuanzheng, Bao Yukun and others, impersonating the North China Military Region, the Municipal Military Control Commission, the picket team, etc., to commit armed robberies. Since August 16th, they successively robbed a cyclist on Cuihua Hutong; robbed an American expatriate, Miss San Elman, of a watch and a handbag near Wangfujing; on September 3rd, while robbing the home of Dai De at No. 42 Wangdaren Hutong, they actually used red-hot iron rods to burn Dai's wife's abdomen in four places, and used pliers to injure her left hand and right leg, forcing her to hand over valuables. After the robbery, the bandit Wang Guiqi shot and wounded Wang Zhengfei, a citizen who was chasing after them, in the right ear, but was eventually captured by the joint efforts of the police and civilians of the No. 3 District. After this, Liu Yingnan and others planned to rob Baomichang in Beixinqiao, Jingshan West Street, and Dongdan Biaobei Hutong, but they did not dare to do so because of the large number of people or the proximity to the police station. After the No. 1 Public Security Sub-bureau learned of this, on September 7th, when the criminals were planning to rob outside Chaoyangmen, they arrested them all and seized a No. 2 Browning pistol and a No. 2 Mauser pistol.

　　连续聚众武装抢劫
　  匪特九名落网
    【本市讯】严重破坏革命秩序，连续聚众武装抢劫的国民党特务匪徒刘英南等九名，已由内一区和内三区公安分局逮捕法办。刘英南原为国民党中统局特务分子，受特务头子王泽久（现在清河大队管训）领导，曾在热河巴林右旗党部工作队工作。三十六年后，该犯即转入国民党匪军部队工作，曾先后充当伪东北暂编第三团团长等职。东北解放后编入伪华北军政干训班受训。北平解放时，该犯为求得掩护计，即潜入伪铁甲兵团，其时已与该兵团教官杨志达等计划武装抢劫，破坏革命秩序。伪铁甲兵团于接受人民解放军改编开赴大同后，该犯即借有病回北平疗养为名，在平秘密组织国民党匪军流散军人杨志达、苗庆芳、朱茂春（在东四以摆卖耗子药摊作掩护）、马俊林（在东四以摆杂面摊作掩护）、及匪徒王贵起、鄂义三、魏川正、宝玉坤等，冒充华北军区、市军管会、纠察队等名义武装抢劫。自八月十六日起，先后在翠花胡同抢劫行人自行车一辆；在王府井附近抢劫美侨桑尔曼（女）手表一只、皮包一个；九月三日在王大人胡同四十二号戴德家中行抢时，竟用烧红通条将戴妻腹部烫伤四处，又用老虎钳子将其左手及右腿等处夹伤，逼索贵重财物，抢毕出门后，匪徒王贵起又开枪射伤正向其追赶的市民王正非右耳，但终被内三区警民联合将王匪捕获。此后刘英南等又计划在北新桥白米仓、景山西街、东单裱褙胡同等处行劫，但因人多或靠近派出所，致未敢下手。内一区公安分局于侦悉后，于九月七日当该犯等正计划到朝阳门外行抢时，将其全部逮捕，并起获二号伯郎宁手枪一支、二号驳壳枪一支。
