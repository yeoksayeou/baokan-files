　　The North China People's Government Press Office
　　Invites Reporters Stationed in Beiping to a Forum to Discuss Strengthening News Reporting
　　[Our Newspaper News] In order to further strengthen ties with the press, the North China People's Government, through its Press Office, held a forum on the 3rd of this month, inviting news reporters stationed in Beiping City. Reporters from People's Daily, Guangming Daily, Progress Daily, Workers' Daily, Xinmin Daily, and Shanghai Dagongbao attended. Secretary-General Tao of the North China People's Government also attended and spoke. The forum began with a speech by Ye Lan, Director of the Press Office, who proposed that everyone study how the news departments of government agencies can closely contact and cooperate with reporters from various newspapers to organize reports. In their speeches, the reporters unanimously felt that they did not understand the work of the government sufficiently and hoped that the government could provide more materials for reporting or information about work related to reporting. They also believed that the focus of work or the publicity and implementation of a certain policy or decree at a certain time should be brought to the attention of reporters in order to cooperate with reporting. At the same time, it was believed that the organization of writing forces should be strengthened among the Press Office, the reporting groups of various departments, and the reporters of various newspapers. First, the former two should provide the reporters of various newspapers with reporting leads.
　　In his speech, Secretary-General Tao pointed out that the relationship between the government and reporters should be one of mutual supply and demand. He hoped that reporters would learn more about the work of the government in order to report better.
　　The specific methods for strengthening contact and organizing reporting proposed by everyone at the forum were studied and adopted by the Press Office after the meeting.
　　[Another News] Before the reporters' forum, the Press Office convened a reporting work conference of the reporting groups of various departments of the North China People's Government to discuss further promoting news reporting. Chairman Dong Biwu attended the meeting and instructed: The People's Government is doing the work of the people, so it should regularly report to the people; everyone should pay attention to and be responsible for news reporting. The Press Office is now studying the organization of reporting work in conjunction with the reporting groups of various departments.

　　华北人民政府新闻发布室
  　邀集驻平记者座谈研讨加强新闻报导
    【本报讯】华北人民政府为进一步加强与新闻界的联系，特由新闻发布室主持，于本月三日邀集驻平市新闻记者举行座谈，到有人民日报、光明日报、进步日报、工人日报、新民报，及上海大公报记者等。华府陶秘书长并莅会讲话。座谈会首由新闻发布室主任叶澜致词，提出请大家研究政府机关的新闻发布部门如何与各报记者密切联系，相互配合，组织报导。各报记者发言中，一致觉得对政府的工作情况还了解不够，希望政府能多供给可资报导的材料或与报导有关的工作情况；并将某一时期的工作中心或某一政策法令的宣传实施，提告记者，以便配合报导。同时认为今后应加强新闻发布室、各部门报导组、各报记者三方面组织写作力量。首先是前二者供给各报记者报导线索。
    陶秘书长讲话中指出，政府与记者之间的关系，应当是互供互求。他希望记者对政府工作多做了解，以便更好的报导。
    座谈会上大家所提出的一些有关加强联系、组织报导的具体办法，均由新闻发布室于会后分别研究采行。
    【又讯】在记者座谈会之前，新闻发布室曾召集华北人民政府各部门报导组举行报导工作会议，讨论进一步推动新闻报导问题。董必武主席曾莅会指示称：人民政府做的是人民的工作，因此就应当向人民经常做报告；大家要重视而且要负责作新闻报导工作。现发布室正会同各部门报导组研究组织报导工作。
