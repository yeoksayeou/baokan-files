　　North China Power Industry Work Conference
  　Determines to Strengthen Unified Leadership to Ensure Long-Term Safe Power Supply
    [Our Dispatch] The North China Power Industry Work Conference opened on September 5th and concluded successfully on the 14th. Over sixty cadres from the Party, government, and labor unions of the North China General Company, Beijing, Tianjin, Tangshan, Chahar-Hebei, Shijiazhuang, Taiyuan Branch Companies, Shijingshan, and Qinhuangdao Power Plants attended. The conference reviewed the work of the North China power industry in the past eight months, believing that the work has been successful. Thanks to the efforts of all employees, not only was production rapidly restored after liberation, ensuring military, civilian, and industrial electricity consumption, but also the transmission losses and fuel consumption were gradually reduced, allowing the power companies in Beijing, Tianjin, Tangshan, and Zhangjiakou to gradually move from decentralized operation to centralized unification, and preliminary democratic reforms were carried out. However, there are still some serious shortcomings in the North China power industry that urgently need to be reformed and overcome. For example, there is a blind and laissez-faire tendency in power generation policy; the overlapping and massive bureaucratic institutions left over from the Kuomintang and the unreasonable wage system have not been well reformed and transformed; there are still many wasteful phenomena in management; power outages or machine damage accidents still occur from time to time in power transmission; the leadership of the Party, government, and labor unions in some areas is not very coordinated, and there are phenomena of uneven distribution of manpower and material resources in various places, which hinder the progress of production tasks. The conference studied the February 7th editorial and the experience of democratic reforms in factories in Northeast China and other documents, listened to reports from Commander-in-Chief Zhu De, Li Lisan, and Chen Yu, Director of the Fuel Department. After repeated deliberation and discussion, everyone clarified the operating policy of the North China power industry as: centralized and unified leadership, implementing enterprise management, establishing an economic accounting system, reducing costs, maximizing machine efficiency, and ensuring long-term, safe, and quantitative power supply. After reviewing the shortcomings in the current work, everyone agreed that only by relying on the workers and mobilizing and uniting all employees can we achieve new democratic enterprise management. Many cadres reflected that accidents occurred continuously because they did not rely on the masses well. At the same time, in the review, instances of achieving success by relying on the masses were also discovered. For example, in the Tangshan Power Plant, due to mobilizing the masses, workers disregarded their own safety and heroically rushed to transport machines during the recent flood. In the Tianjin Power Plant, due to giving play to the workers' initiative, a boiler that needed forty days to repair was completed in fourteen days. The leadership in Qinhuangdao took the mass line and saved a lot of coal and electricity. Regarding the relationship between the Party, government, and labor unions, everyone agreed that they should unite under the principle of "everything for production." In order to implement the new democratic enterprise management policy, it was decided to quickly revise the unreasonable systems in the existing institutions, establish a strict economic quota management and economic accounting system, overcome waste, stipulate cost standards, reduce various losses and consumption, promote overcoming difficulties and self-reliance, overcome departmentalism, and strengthen centralized and unified leadership and overall thinking.

　　华北电业工作会议
  　确定加强统一领导保证长期安全供电
    【本报讯】华北电业工作会议于九月五日开幕，十四日完满结束。到有华北总公司、北平、天津、唐山、察中、石门、太原分公司、石景山、秦皇岛发电厂等单位之党政工干部六十余人。会议检阅了八个月来华北电业工作，认为过去八个月来华电工作是有成绩的。由于全体职工的努力，不仅在解放后迅速恢复了生产，保证了军需民用和工业用电，逐渐降低了送电损失和燃料消耗，使平、津、唐、张各电业公司渐逐由分散经营走向了集中统一，并进行了初步的民主改革。但目前华北电业尚存在着一些严重缺点，急待改革与克服。如发电方针存在着盲目自流偏向；国民党遗留下来重叠庞大的官僚机构，不合理的工资制度，尚未做到很好的改革与改造；管理上还存在着不少的浪费现象；在发送电方面，停电或损毁机器的事故尚时有发生；某些地区的党政工领导上不甚协调，以及各地在人力物力上此多彼少的现象等，均妨碍了生产任务的进行。会议学习了二七社论及东北有关工厂民主改革的经验等文件，听取了朱总司令、李立三及燃料处陈郁处长的报告，经过大家反复酝酿讨论，明确了华北电业的经营方针为：集中统一领导，实行企业化管理，建立经济核算制度，减低成本，发挥机器效能，保证长期的、安全的、定量的供电。大家检讨了目前工作中所存在着的缺点后，一致认为只有依靠工人，发动并团结全体职工，才能实现新民主主义的企业管理。不少干部检讨，因未很好依靠群众，以致事故连续发生。同时在检讨中也发现了依靠群众而获得成绩的实例。如唐山发电厂因发动了群众，在这次水灾中，出现了工人奋不顾身，英勇抢运机器的事迹。天津发电厂，因发挥了工人的积极性，需要四十天才能修好的锅炉，十四天便完成了。秦皇岛领导上走了群众路线，便大量节省了煤电。在党政工关系上，大家一致认为应在“一切为了生产”的原则下团结起来。为了贯彻新民主主义的企业管理方针，决定对现有机构中的不合理制度，迅速予以修正，建立严格的经济定额管理与经济核算制度，克服浪费现象，规定成本标准，减少各种损失消耗，提倡克服困难自力更生，克服本位主义，加强集中统一领导及整体思想。
