　　The Days of Freedom and Equality Have Arrived!
  　Miao Women Repair Roads to Support Our Army in Fujian
    [Report from this newspaper] According to the Nanjing Xinhua Daily: During the Fuzhou Campaign, Miao women on the north bank of the Min River repaired roads for the People's Liberation Army, actively supporting the PLA in combat. When the left-wing troops of the People's Liberation Army attacking Fuzhou began to climb a steep and narrow mountain path on the edge of the Dai River (a river between Luoyuan and Gutian on the north bank of the Min River, flowing through Lianjiang into the sea) with the help of engineers, Miao women from the Songhong Mountain area by the river spontaneously came to help the PLA repair the road. Their skin was tanned and healthy, with large earrings hanging from their ears, wearing clothes with colored wide borders, smiling, and barefoot, carrying soil to repair and fill potholes. A Miao farmer who knew a little Mandarin told the People's Liberation Army that the Miao people had suffered greatly from the oppression and discrimination of the Kuomintang bandits. Now they know that the People's Liberation Army is their own army, treating the Miao people equally, so they voluntarily come to help repair the road.

　　自由平等的日子到了！
  　苗族妇女修路支援闽境我军
    【本报讯】据南京新华日报载：福州战役中闽江北岸的苗族妇女为人民解放军修填道路，积极支援解放军作战。当向福州进攻的人民解放军左翼部队由工兵开始攀登岱江（闽江北岸罗源古田之间的一条江，流经连江入海）边上一条陡狭的山径时，江边嵩洪山一带苗族妇女，自动跑来帮助解放军修路，他们皮肤棕黑而健康，两耳坠着一对大耳环，穿带色镶宽边的衣服，面带欢笑，赤脚大步地担土修填洼坑。一个略懂普通话的苗族农民告诉解放军，苗族人民极受国民党匪帮的压迫和歧视，现在知道解放军是自己的队伍，对苗人平等，所以自动来帮助修路。
