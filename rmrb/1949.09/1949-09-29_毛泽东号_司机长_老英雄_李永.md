　　“Mao Zedong Locomotive” Chief Driver
　　Old Hero – Li Yong
　　Lin Yin
　　Li Yong, the chief driver of the “Mao Zedong Locomotive,” the national locomotive banner, delivered a congratulatory speech to the People's Political Consultative Conference on its fourth day, representing the national working class. When reporters went to interview him, he said: "This honor should not be for me personally; it should be the honor of the entire working class, the honor of the Communist Party. Without the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, how could I have this day? In the Kuomintang era, for such a national conference, an ordinary worker wouldn't even dare to glance at it. But today, I can represent the working class to deliver a congratulatory speech to the conference, which shows that under the leadership of the People's Government and the Communist Party, we workers have truly become masters."
　　"I met Chairman Mao!" The forty-nine-year-old hero grinned like a child. He excitedly told reporters that seeing Chairman Mao, whom he had longed to see for many years, made him truly happy from the bottom of his heart. He chuckled and said, "Chairman Mao shook my hand so kindly and affectionately that I was so happy I couldn't speak. I feel like I'm a young lad again, full of energy."
　　Indeed, Comrade Li Yong cannot be called old. Although everyone who knows him respectfully calls him "Old Hero Li Yong," he possesses the heroic spirit of a "People's Labor Hero" who is forever young.
　　He started working on the railway at the age of seventeen and has been doing it for thirty-two years. He started as a temporary worker in Harbin and slowly worked his way up to become a driver. He has been a driver for thirteen years. During these years, he suffered grievances and hardships until after liberation, when he truly turned over and became the master of the locomotive. He often tells people: "In the past, I was just a slave to the locomotive. Only after the Communist Party came and implemented the responsibility system did I truly use the machine."
　　Li Yong's ability to become a people's labor hero is not accidental.
　　In March 1946, the Eighth Route Army arrived in Harbin. This team treated the people very kindly, buying and selling fairly, never seizing cars or beating people. All of this made him realize that the Eighth Route Army was fundamentally different from the Kuomintang army. With the excellent essence of the working class, he understood the rich and profound meaning of the term "liberation." From then on, he never took a day off, and he was unwilling to rest even when he was sick.
　　Once, he was running a passenger train from Harbin to Yimianpo, traveling more than 300 kilometers back and forth. After completing the task, he sent the locomotive to the Sanke Tree safety depot. Passing through the Binjiang Station, the station gave the signal, and the train started. It was late at night, the sky was dark, and he was extremely tired, but his high sense of responsibility made him pay attention to the front. He noticed a dark locomotive pressing on the turnout. He immediately applied the brakes automatically, stopping just two meters short of a collision. Another time, traveling from Wangzhaotun to Harbin, it was a curved track, forming a cross with another line from Guxiangtun to Magou. The side of the road was a high earthen cliff, making it difficult to see the curve ahead. Departing from Wangzhaotun was downhill. When approaching this intersection, Li Yong knew to be careful. He listened attentively. Based on his experience, he heard a booming sound. He knew a locomotive was coming from the opposite direction. He automatically slowed down and instructed the stoker next to him to immediately sound the danger signal whistle. Sure enough, the locomotive opposite also sounded the danger whistle, and both stopped, avoiding a serious head-on collision. This again illustrates Li Yong's valuable experience and sense of responsibility.
　　Several dangerous accidents were avoided due to his careful experience. He said, "In the past, working for others could be careless, but now we are working for the people's own railway, so we must be extra careful." This is a conscious worker, engaging in work with the attitude of a master.
　　Since he took over the "Mao Zedong Locomotive," he has worked even harder, creating a record of 139,218 kilometers of safe running without any accidents for which he was responsible, becoming a model for the Harbin Locomotive Depot in eliminating accidents and being praised as the "Locomotive Leader" in the labor model movement. After the liberation of Beiping, the "Mao Zedong Locomotive" was transferred to the Fengtai Locomotive Depot within the customs. From March 27th to May Day, the "Mao Zedong Locomotive" collectively won two major merits in one month, and Li Yong personally won one major merit, playing a significant exemplary role in promoting the responsibility system in the Fengtai Locomotive Depot. Under his leadership and assistance, the Fengtai "May Day Labor Locomotive" and three other locomotives became typical locomotives in the northern railway, fully demonstrating the spirit of new collective heroism. Therefore, he was promoted to section chief-level driver at the National Locomotive Conference. The "Mao Zedong Locomotive" was selected as the national locomotive banner.
　　The "Mao Zedong Locomotive" will soon go south. Unfortunately, his eighty-three-year-old father and three-year-old granddaughter both died of illness. However, he still insisted on working as usual and did not let this unfortunate accident affect his work, fully demonstrating the excellent qualities of a Communist Party member. When reporters asked him about his thoughts on going south this time, he said: "The people's railway is increasing day by day with the victorious situation. I want to learn more humbly and absorb good experiences in the important locomotive depots across the country, live up to the glorious title of 'Locomotive Leader,' and help promote the responsibility system in various places, so that the country's locomotive work will advance in unison, regardless of north or south."

　　“毛泽东号”司机长
    老英雄——李永
    林印
    全国机车的旗帜“毛泽东号”司机长李永，在人民政协会议第四天，代表全国工人阶级向大会致祝词。当记者去访问他时，他说：“这个光荣不应当是我个人的，这应当是全体工人阶级的光荣，是共产党的光荣。如果没有共产党和毛主席，我那会有今天呢？若是在国民党时期，开这样全国性的大会，一个普通的工人，连瞅也不敢瞅一眼的。但是今天，我能代表工人阶级来向大会致祝词，这是说明在人民政府和共产党领导下，我们工人真正做了主人。”
    “我会见了毛主席！”四十九岁的老英雄，象孩子一样裂开大嘴笑了。他兴奋地告诉记者，他看见了多年向往的毛主席真是打心底里高兴出来。他笑嘻嘻地说：“毛主席那么慈祥亲切地和我握手，使我高兴得说不出话来。我现在觉得我还是和年青的小伙子一样，浑身都是劲。”
    的确，李永同志是不能称为老的，虽然所有认识他的人都尊称他“老英雄李永”，可是他却具有“人民的劳动英雄”那种永远年青的英雄气概。
    他从十七岁就到铁路上做工，到现在已经三十二年了。一直在哈尔滨从一个临时小工做起，慢慢熬成了个司机。做司机这个工作也有十三年了。这些年中，他受尽了冤气和辛苦，直到解放后，他才真正翻了身，做了机车的主人。他常常向人说：“过去那些年我都只是机车的奴隶，只有在共产党来了，实行了负责制以后，我才真正地使用了机器。”
    李永所以能够成为人民的劳动英雄，并不是偶然的。
    一九四六年三月八路军到了哈尔滨，这支队伍对待老百姓非常和气，公买公卖，从不抓车、打人。这一切使他认识了八路军和国民党军队根本不同，他以工人阶级的优秀的本质，体会到“解放”这个名词的丰富和深刻的内容。从那以后他没有请过一天假，有了病也不愿休息。
    有一次他跑客车，从哈尔滨到一面坡，来回跑了三百多公里，任务完毕，送机车至三棵树安全库，经过滨江车站，站上给了信号，车开了，深夜，天黑，极度疲乏，但是他的高度的责任心使他注意到前面，黑黑的一台机车压着道岔子，他立刻自动煞车，只差两米没撞上去。又一次，从王兆屯行车至哈尔滨，是弯形道，和另外一条从顾乡屯到马沟的线路，成十字形，道旁是很高的土崖，不大能够看得见前面拐角。从王兆屯出发是下坡，走到这十字岔口附近的时候，李永知道要注意了。他聚精会神的倾听着。凭着经验，他听到了一种轰轰的声音。他知道对面有机车过来。他自动徐行了，关照身旁的司炉，立刻拉响了危险信号汽笛，果然对面那台机车也拉了危险汽笛，都停下来避免了一次正面冲突的恶性事故。这又一次说明了李永的可贵的经验与责任心。
    好几次危险事故，都由于他的细心经验而避免了。他说“过去给别人干活可以马马虎虎，现在是给人民自己的铁道干活了，就得加倍小心。”这是觉悟了的工人，以主人翁底态度来从事工作的。
    自从他包了“毛泽东号”机车，更加努力工作，创造安全走行十三万九千二百十八公里的纪录，从未出过责任事故，成为哈尔滨机务段消灭事故的模范，在劳模运动中被誉为“机车领袖”。北平解放后，“毛泽东号”被调到关内丰台机务段，从三月二十七日到“五一”，一个月内，“毛泽东号”就集体立过两次大功，李永个人立大功一次，在丰台机务段推行负责制中起了极大示范作用。在他的带领和帮助下，丰台“五一劳动号”及其他三台机车都成了北方铁路的典型机车，充分表现了新的集体英雄主义的精神。因此在全国机务会议上被提升为段长级司机。“毛泽东号”被选作全国机车的旗帜。
    “毛泽东号”不久就要南下了。不幸他的八十三岁的父亲和三岁的小孙女都得病死了。可是他仍照常坚持工作，没有因为这个不幸事故而影响工作，完全表现了一个共产党员的优秀品质。当记者问到他这次南下的感想时，他说：“人民的铁路随着胜利形势一天天增加，我要在全国的重要机务段，更加虚心的学习，吸取好的经验，不辜负‘机车领袖’这个光荣称号，并且帮助各地推行负责制，使全国的机务工作不分南北，齐步前进。”
