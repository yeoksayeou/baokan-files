    Zhang Siwei is a teacher in the middle school class attached to Zhaizi Complete Primary School in Anping County, Hebei Province. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, he was originally a junior primary school teacher. Through humbly learning and patiently studying from "teaching and learning from each other," he gradually enriched his knowledge and experience, and improved step by step. He has fourteen years of teaching history, and enjoys a high reputation among teachers in the county.
    He is honest and simple, outspoken and straightforward, and also sincere and amiable. When he discovers that others have a strength in labor, learning, or work, he will do his best to praise it and call on everyone to learn from it. If he sees shortcomings in others, he will patiently help to correct them.
    Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, in his first year of teaching, he encountered a major flood. His family was already poor, and coupled with the difficulties of crop failure and collapsed houses, he and his brother had to separate and live independently. Four mu of barren saline-alkali land and two small houses without a courtyard wall became his only property. His wife, with three young children, was exhausted and unable to do any work. He relied solely on the few dollars he earned each month to support his family. The following year, while teaching in the village, he rented three and a half mu of land from the landlord, paying half the harvest as rent. He and his wife plowed and planted the land early in the morning and late at night. The family of five barely survived, half-starved.
    The War of Resistance began! Our anti-Japanese democratic government first issued the policy of "reducing rent and interest" and organized mutual aid, on the one hand reducing the exploitation of peasants by landlords, and on the other hand alleviating the difficulty that teaching made it impossible to take care of family production. In this way, life gradually improved. Following this, the land reform policy was implemented. Not only did the two mu of land that had been mortgaged due to debt in earlier years and the land rented from the landlord return home, but he also received three mu of good land, half a cow, and household utensils. At this time, his wife and eldest daughter were able to take on the work of farming. They could also spin and weave their own cloth in the spring and winter seasons. Adding the salary he earned from teaching, life was developing towards prosperity. He said very excitedly: "If it weren't for the Communist Party, how could I have the life I have today!"
    The glorious task of "educating the next generation" is his lifelong career. He often says: "Being with innocent and lively children all day long allows me to experience the purest and most sincere love in human society." In order to teach the students well, even if he lives very close to home, he rarely goes home to visit. Last year, when his wife was giving birth, she asked him to go home repeatedly, but because the school was busy with the end-of-month exams, he didn't go back after all. He has many years of teaching experience and is generally very skilled. However, he never relaxes in his preparation work. He consults books according to the content of the textbook and prepares complete notes to help students remember.
    For the regular end-of-month exam, he first establishes evaluation criteria based on the content of the test questions, and then carefully checks the papers. If he is too busy, he will definitely check the papers that others have helped to grade again to avoid differences in the assigned scores. He said: "The students' evaluation of the exam is more important than anything else. If it is done carelessly, it will inevitably affect their learning enthusiasm, not to mention being responsible for their work."
    "From the students, to the students," this is his key to teaching. He always conducts oral question and answer sessions in class for the lessons taught each day to test the students' understanding. During spare time, he plans to find students of different levels, check their level of understanding and listen to feedback and opinions through casual conversations, in order to improve his own teaching methods. When he finds that students often make mistakes in their notes and compositions, he always sorts them out and corrects them separately in Chinese language instruction. Furthermore, in order to launch a literacy competition, he established a system of learning three characters every day. Each student freely selects three new characters, whether from the textbook or the newspaper, based on their own level, and writes them in a literacy manual to be taken out and recited at any time on the way to and from school. He uses all possible time to check the students' literacy progress, promptly promoting models of extensive knowledge and strong memory, which encourages everyone's enthusiasm for literacy. He is also able to squeeze out a certain amount of time every day to join various study groups to help them study their lessons, and often uses Chairman Mao's words: "New China relies on us to build it, so we must study hard," earnestly advising them. Therefore, under the enthusiasm of "teachers love students, students love teachers," a learning movement has been launched throughout the school.
    In his busy work, he never relaxes in his own learning. He gets up early and goes to bed late every day, squeezing in time to study newly published books and periodicals. He pays even closer attention to newspaper study. If there is anything he doesn't understand, he not only studies it with his colleagues, but also immediately writes a letter to ask about it to get a clear understanding. As for the medical knowledge, history, geography, natural science, and other materials in the newspaper, he always cuts them out or copies them down and organizes them.
    Since the call for "teachers to study on the job," he has been selected as the leader of the study group. In order to improve his professional level, he organizes everyone to study junior high school algebra and commercial bookkeeping. As usual, after grading students' homework every night, he concentrates on studying, working out the exercises on the page one by one. In addition, he also helps primary school teachers understand the upper primary school curriculum, and everyone feels they have gained a lot. When the community teachers study collectively, he is responsible for answering questions on natural science.
    With a talkative and outgoing personality, he often interacts with the masses. People often ask him to write invitations, write couplets, and write letters, and they all feel that he is very kind and easy to ask for help.
    He is usually very frugal and does not waste a penny. When there was a call for teachers to donate money during the summer floods last year, everyone felt that his family was in the disaster area and he was raising a large family of eight, so life was really difficult enough, and no one wanted him to donate rice for disaster relief. However, he volunteered to donate more grain than anyone else. He also said: "The disaster-stricken people are very badly affected and lack food and clothing. I have experienced those days. Although my family's crops have also been flooded, I still have my monthly salary to support them a little, which is much better than them. It feels better to donate a little, and it makes me feel better!"
    With the habit of diligence cultivated since childhood, he has taken on the work of leading students to clean up the school's hygiene. There are no janitors in the school, and the work of carrying water and cooking is done by everyone in turn. He always rushes to do it. As long as he sees that the water tank is empty, he quietly goes to carry water. Especially during the snowy days last year, carrying a load of fresh water back and forth took two li, but he took on this task alone. He has always been "working ahead and eating behind," and has never complained about anyone.
    He often says: "In this world, there is no shortcut to anything. As long as you are willing to work hard at teaching, you can teach the students well. We must run the school better in order to gain the support of the masses!"

    张四维是河北安平县寨子完全小学附设中学班的教员。他在抗战前，本来是个初小教师，因从“教学相长”中，虚心地学习和耐心地钻研，逐渐充实和丰富自己的学识与经验，才一步一步的提高了。他有着十四年的教书历史，在全县的教师中，声誉是很高的。
    他为人诚朴，口快心直，而又恳挚和蔼。当他发现到别人在劳动上、学习上、或工作上，有一点长处时，他便极力表扬；号召大家学习。若是见到别人有缺点时，便耐心地去帮助纠正。
    抗战前，在他头一年教书时，就赶上发大水。家里本来就苦寒，又加上籽粒不收和房倒屋塌的困难，便把他哥俩分出来单独过活。四亩薄沙碱地和没有院墙的两间小屋，便成为他唯一的财产。他老婆带着三个小孩子，累手累脚地什么活也干不了，单单靠着他每月挣几块钱来养家度日；第二年在当村教书，由地主手里，以对半交租的关系，佃种了三亩半地。他利用一早一晚的工夫，和老婆刨种着几亩地。一家五口的日子，半饥半饱的勉强混下去。
    抗战开始了！我抗日民主政权，首先发布了“减租减息”政策和组织互助办法，一方面减轻了地主对农民的剥削，另一方面解除了教书无法照顾家庭生产的困难。这样，生活才一步一步地上升了。紧接着实行了土地改革的政策，不仅早年因负债当出的二亩地和佃种地主的土地都回了家，另外还分了三亩好地，半头牛和家常用具等。这时，他老婆和大女孩子，已能担起种地的活计；还能在春冬两间的季节里，做到了自纺自织，再添上他教书挣来的薪米，日子正在向着富裕的生活发展着。他非常兴奋地说：“若不是共产党来了，我怎能会有今天的生活呢！”
    “教育后一代”的光荣任务，是他终身的事业。他经常地讲：“成天价和天真活泼的儿童在一起，才体验到人类社会上最纯洁的真挚热爱。”为着把学生教好，即便离家多近，他是很少到家去看看的。去年在他老婆生孩子的那几天，三番五次地叫他回家，因为学校里正忙着月终考试，到底也没有回去。他有着多年的教书经验，大体上很熟练了。可是，他在事前的准备工作，是一点不放松的；对照着课文去参考一些书籍，整理出很完善的笔记，来帮助学生的记忆。
    照例的月终考试，他根据试题的内容，首先做出评定标准来，然后再缜密的去检查。倘若在忙不过来时，旁人帮助看过的试卷，必定还要再来一次检查，以免得评定分数上发生了差异。他说：“学生对考试的评订，比什么都重要。若是潦草从事，必然会影响他们的学习情绪，更说不上对工作负责了。”
    “从学生中来，到学生中去，”这是他教书的要诀。每天所讲的功课，一定在课堂里进行口头问答，来考验学生接受的情形。课余的时间，便有计划地找到不同程度的学生，通过漫谈的形式，检查理解的程度并听取反映和意见，以备改进并提高自己的教学方式。当他发现到学生的笔记和作文中，常有弄差的错别字，他都是随时整理出来，在国语教学上分别予以订正。更为了展开识字竞赛，建立每天学三字的制度。由各生根据自己的水平，不管是课本上或是报纸上的生字，自由选择三个写在识字手册上，以备往返途中，随时拿出来念，他便利用一切可能时间，去检查学生的识字情形，及时的发场博学强记的模范，鼓舞了大家的识字热情。他还能够每天拙出一定时间，加入到各学习小组里去，帮助他们研究功课，并常用毛主席的话：“新中国依靠我们来建设，我们就须努力学习。”谆谆的劝告了他们。因此，在“师爱生，生爱师”的热情下，全校展开了学习运动。
    成天在忙迫的工作中，他是不放松学习的。天天起早晚睡挤功夫来研究新出版的书刊，对于报纸学习抓得更紧，有不了解的地方，除了和同仁们来研究以外，马上就写信去问，弄个清楚明白。至于报上的医学常识、历史、地理、自然科学等材料，都是随时剪裁或抄录下来，加以整理。
    自号召“教师在职学习”以来，他便被选为学习组长了。为着提高业务水平，组织大家研究初中代数和商业簿记学，照例是每晚批阅学生作业后，便聚精会神的研究起来，把上边的练习题逐次演算出来。另外还帮助初小教师弄通高小课程，大家都感到收获挺大。当小区教师集体学习时，由他负责解答自然科学上的问题。
    爱说爱道的脾气，他是常和群众打交道的。经常有人找去写帖，写对子，写信，都觉得他挺和气又很好求的。
    他平常是很俭朴的，一文钱也不乱花。当去年夏汛成灾，号召教师募捐时，大家都觉得他家在灾区，又养着一窝八代的孩子，日子是真够困难的，谁也不愿让他捐米救灾。但是，他自报捐粮比谁也不少拿。还说：“人家被灾都很重，缺吃少穿的日子，我是经历过的。我家的庄稼虽然也淹了，每个月还有我来接济一点，比起他们来是好得多了，还是捐助点，心里到痛快哩！”
    自小养成的勤劳习惯，他便担起领导学生清整卫生的工作。学校里没有工友，担水做饭的活，都是大家轮流着来干，他一贯的是抢着去做，只要看到水缸没有水，便悄悄去担。尤其是在去年下雪的那几天，担一挑甜水，来回就得跑上二里地，却由他一人承担了这一任务。从来就是“干在头里，吃在后头”，始终没有抱怨过任何人。
    他经常在说：“世界上，什么事也没有巧道。教书只要肯卖力气，就能把学生教好。我们要把学校办得更好，才能取得群众的拥护！”
