　　Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government
　  Orders Strict Prohibition of Slaughtering Draft Cattle
    [Report from this newspaper] Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an: The large-scale slaughter of draft cattle in various parts of Dazhong, Shaanxi, is affecting rural production. The Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government has now issued a strict prohibition. According to investigations, in Xi'an alone, an average of about forty head of draft cattle are slaughtered daily, with only a small number being old, infirm, or unusable. To this end, the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government has issued a strict prohibition and issued instructions urging governments at all levels to pay close attention to correcting this. The instructions state: "Currently, draft cattle are the main power in agricultural production. The Northwest region has long suffered from the exploitation of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and rural livestock is already insufficient. Existing draft animals should be even more cherished." The instructions also strictly stipulate: "Except for old, infirm, or unusable draft cattle, which must be approved by the local government before slaughter, the slaughter of any cattle capable of plowing is strictly prohibited. Those who deliberately violate this regulation shall be punished according to the severity of the circumstances. All localities should mobilize the masses to supervise and report violations and prevent clandestine slaughter. Government cadres who fail to effectively carry out this task should be criticized. Densely populated areas such as Xi'an, Xianyang, Baoji, and Sanyuan must formulate specific measures, such as implementing butcher registration, to prevent the indiscriminate slaughter of draft animals. Public security, health, and tax authorities should conduct thorough inspections and effectively cooperate in the implementation."

　　陕甘宁边区政府
　  明令禁杀耕牛
    【本报讯】新华社西安电：陕西大关中各地大量宰杀耕牛，影响农村生产，陕甘宁边区政府刻已明令禁止。据调查，仅西安一市，平均每日宰杀耕牛即达四十头左右，其中齿老残废，不能使用者仅占少数。为此，陕甘宁边区政府特明令禁止，并发出指示，敦促各级人民政府严格注意纠正。指示称：目前耕牛在农业生产上是主要动力，西北各地长期遭受蒋胡匪帮压榨，农村牲畜本已不足，现有耕畜更应倍加爱护。指示并严格规定：农村耕牛除齿老残废不能使用者，须经当地政府批准方得宰杀外，凡可耕作者，严禁宰杀。倘有故意违犯者，得视情节轻重，分别予以惩处。各地应发动群众监督、检举并防止偷杀。政府干部对此项任务执行不力者，应提出批评。西安、咸阳、宝鸡、三原等人口集中地区，更须制定具体办法，如实行屠户登记等，以防乱杀耕畜。公安、卫生及税务机关应认真检查，切实配合执行。
