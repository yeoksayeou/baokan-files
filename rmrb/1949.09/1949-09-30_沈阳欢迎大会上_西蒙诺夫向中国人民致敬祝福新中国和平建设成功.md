　　At the Shenyang Welcome Rally
　　Simonov Pays Tribute to the Chinese People and Wishes the New China Success in Peaceful Construction
　　[Special dispatch from our correspondent in Shenyang, 6:00 PM on the 29th] Soviet People's Representative Simonov delivered a speech at the Shenyang Welcome Rally. The full text is as follows:
　　Dear friends, first of all, please allow me to extend friendly and fraternal greetings to you who are welcoming us and to the great, freedom-loving, and victorious Chinese people! We are representatives of the Soviet cultural, literary, and artistic circles. Our comrades sent us here with the task of developing and consolidating the friendly ties between the great Soviet people and the great Chinese people's cultural workers. This task is both great and glorious, and we will certainly complete it with the greatest enthusiasm. The love of the Soviet people for the great Chinese people and the sympathy of the Soviet people for the Chinese people's heroic struggle against imperialism have existed for a long time. This love and sympathy did not begin today or yesterday. For more than twenty years, we Soviet people have paid close attention to and cared deeply about your struggle. When we were still in middle and high school, we paid attention to the news of the victories of the Chinese People's Army. When we were in university, we were very happy to hear about the heroic deeds of the Chinese People's Army's 25,000-li Long March. When we ourselves were fighting in Moscow and Stalingrad, in Vilnius and Berlin, we knew and remembered that in those days, the Chinese People's Liberation Army was fighting heroically against the Japanese occupiers and traitors. While we were healing the wounds of war at home, we remembered with anger that when we were fighting in Stalingrad, the American imperialists were unwilling to open a second battlefield; but they helped the despicable Chiang Kai-shek transport troops to attack the Chinese People's Liberation Areas in this place—in the Northeast—with many planes and warships. For more than twenty years, our hearts have often been with you. Therefore, I want to say that the long-standing friendship between the Soviet people and the Chinese people is inseparable and very strong. Therefore, we feel very proud when we talk about this friendship. Therefore, we are ready to work very happily to consolidate this friendship. We are very happy to pay tribute to you in Shenyang. Shenyang, this city, has a tradition of resisting Japanese aggressors and American imperialists. We celebrate your victory in the revolutionary struggle. We hope that you will have great success in the cause of peaceful construction of the New China. We believe that the Soviet people and the Chinese people will work hand in hand for world peace. We know that there is no force in the world that can destroy or defeat the alliance of friendship between our two great peoples.
　　Long live the friendship between the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic China! This friendship can bring peace to the whole world and death to all imperialists! Long live Mao Zedong, the leader of the great Chinese people! Long live Stalin, the leader and friend of progressive people all over the world! (Yao Fu)

　　沈阳欢迎大会上
  　西蒙诺夫向中国人民致敬祝福新中国和平建设成功
    【本报记者沈阳二十九日下午六时专电】苏联人民代表团代表西蒙诺夫在沈阳欢迎会致词，全文如下：
    亲爱的朋友们，首先允许我向欢迎我们的您们和伟大的爱好自由的和胜利的中国人民致友爱的兄弟的衷心的敬礼！我们是苏联的文化界、文学界和艺术界的代表，我们的同志派我们到这里来，给我们的任务是发展和巩固伟大的苏联人民和伟大中国的人民文化工作者的友谊的联系。这个任务是巨大的光荣的。我们一定用最大的热情来完成它。苏联人对于伟大的中国人民的热爱，苏联人对于中国人民反对帝国主义英勇的斗争的同情，是很久以来就有了的。这种热爱和同情不是今天和昨天才有的，二十多年以来我们苏联人就非常注意非常关心您们的斗争。我们还在中小学校念书的时候，就注意中国人民军队胜利的消息。在大学念书的时候，我们很高兴的听到中国人民军队二万五千里长征的英勇事实。当我们自己在莫斯科和斯大林格勒、在维尔纳和柏林打仗的时候，我们知道也记得在这些日子里，中国人民解放军反抗日本占领者和卖国贼的英勇的战斗。我们在自己家里医治战争的伤痕含着愤怒的心情，想起我们在斯大林格勒打仗的时候，美帝国主义者不愿意开辟第二战场；但是他们在这个地方——在东北用很多飞机和军舰帮助卑鄙的蒋介石运兵来进攻中国人民解放区。二十多年以来，我们的心常常和您们在一道。因此我想说苏联人民和中国人民长久的友谊是不能分开的，是非常结实的。因此我们讲到这个友谊的时候，感觉得很自豪的。因此我们准备很高兴的为巩固这个友谊而工作。我们很高兴在沈阳向您们致敬礼。沈阳这个城是有反抗日本侵略者和美国帝国主义者的传统的。我们庆祝你们在革命斗争中的胜利。我们希望你们在和平建设新中国事业里会有很大的成功。我们相信苏联人民和中国人民要手携手的为全世界和平而奋斗。我们知道世界上没有任何一种力量能够破坏和战胜我们两个伟大的人民的友谊的同盟。
    苏联和人民民主中国的友谊万岁！这种友谊能够使全世界获得和平，使一切帝国主义者死亡！伟大中国人民的领袖毛泽东万岁！全世界进步人们的领袖和朋友斯大林万岁！  （药夫）
