　　[This Newspaper] The barracks where a certain unit of the General Rear Services Department and its affiliated units reside have fallen into disrepair due to years of neglect and destruction by the Kuomintang bandit gang. This summer, excessive rainfall caused over a hundred rooms to collapse or leak, and more than ten sections of walls also collapsed. It is estimated that repairs would require wages and materials equivalent to 13,023 catties of millet. In response to the People's Government's call to cherish public property and practice thrift, the Party committee of the department decided to undertake the repairs themselves. All officers and soldiers enthusiastically responded, launching a surge of utilizing waste materials (such as broken box planks and broken sacks) to reduce the burden on the people. After more than ten days of active repairs, most of the work has now been completed. According to preliminary statistics, a total of wages and material costs equivalent to approximately 8,500 catties of millet have been saved.
