Teachers and Students of Beiping City in Summer Vacation
Recording the Summer Study of Over 20,000 Teachers and Students in Beiping City
    Chen Hong, Wang Jinfeng
   During the first summer vacation since the liberation of Beiping, more than 23,000 teachers and students from schools participated in collective study, including more than 16,600 students from universities and middle schools, as well as Party members and Youth League members, and more than 5,800 primary and secondary school teachers. This summer study mainly targeted the ideological problems that were quite common among intellectuals, such as supra-class thinking, individualistic liberalism of taking the middle road, anti-internationalist thinking, and erroneous views on history and revolution. Over the past month of study, the above-mentioned ideas have generally been initially resolved from the perspectives of labor and class. The method of combining theory with practice was implemented in the study, linking it with self-criticism of one's own thinking, and fully developing the spirit of free thought and letting go of democratic discussion. Many Party and other responsible comrades, such as Peng Zhen, Bo Yibo, Xu Teli, Liu Lantao, Hu Qiaomu, Ai Siqi, Qian Junrui, Feng Wenbin, Jiang Nanxiang, etc., personally gave lectures, which greatly helped the students. The vast majority of participants have made great progress; they have initially established a revolutionary outlook on life, strengthened their determination to serve the people, further strengthened their understanding of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, and greatly increased their connection with the Chinese Communist Party. In the Youth Academy and the Summer Study Group for University and Middle School Students alone, more than 1,380 students joined the New Democratic Youth League. Many Party and Youth League cadres combined practical experience with the study of work methods, strengthened their mass perspective, and many students were tempered in factories and other practical work positions. Everyone felt that the gains of this summer vacation were unprecedentedly rich. Many people felt that the time had passed too quickly and were reluctant to leave at the end of the study. The situation of each study organization is briefly described as follows:

Youth Academy—The “Youth Academy” organized by the Preparatory Committee of the New Democratic Youth League of Beiping City and the Beiping Student Union is the best place to exercise body and mind, suitable for students in Beiping. Participating students from universities and middle schools choose courses and participate in activities entirely on a voluntary basis. There were more than 11,400 participants. Here, various youth lectures such as "Labor Creates the World," "How Young People Recognize the New World," "Individual and Collective," "Return from Prague," "The Story of the Long March," "May in Moscow," "Random Talks about Soviet Life," etc., have been held 61 times successively. Cultural tutoring was also held, with a total of 360 classes per week and 8,000 participants. In this way, the political and cultural level of the students has been continuously improved during the summer vacation. The academy generally set up libraries and recreation rooms, and organized dance classes and singing teams. Various recreational activities were also carried out. Collective film screenings, social gatherings, half-day labor, tours and performances by cultural troupes, etc., made the academy full of a lively atmosphere. At the innovative sports meeting at the graduation ceremony of the academy, people can clearly see the new atmosphere of student life after liberation, such as the men's 800-meter relay race symbolizing the history of the Red Army's struggle, and the five-star race representing advancement under the illumination of the red star, which are all vivid and educational programs; "Democratic Youth Collective Exercises," Yangko dance, and glider model performances all demonstrated the collective spirit and expressed the youthful vitality and creativity of the liberated youth.

After 36 days of study, listening to lectures on "Labor Creates the World" and "Five Modes of Production - Class Struggle," and participating in "Half-Day Labor," the students corrected their past erroneous concepts of despising labor. The infusion of new knowledge and the edification of collective life allowed the students to progress happily and unconsciously. At the end of the academy, more than 880 outstanding young people were approved to join the Youth League.

Summer Study Group for University and Middle School Students—This was also jointly organized by the Preparatory Committee of the New Democratic Youth League of Beiping City and the Student Union. Half of the 2,000 students participating in the study group were Youth League members. Among the 2,000 people, university students accounted for one-third. The study group began to focus on studying the two basic viewpoints of historical materialism—the labor viewpoint and the class viewpoint—and from this understanding, recognized the future of the world, China, and intellectuals. In the second half of the study, it turned to studying youth work—the ability to unite and educate a generation of young people, in order to connect with the actual Youth League work in schools. At the beginning of the study group, the Youth League members and students did not have very correct ideas about the purpose of study, the method of study, etc., but at the beginning of the study, the leaders strictly pointed out that they should oppose the dogmatic method of study, and especially emphasized the methods of developing democracy, connecting with reality, and self-criticism. A month of experience has proved that this method of study is a major reason for the students to have rich gains in a short period of time.

The study group successively listened to more than a dozen major reports by responsible comrades from all aspects on historical materialism, revolutionary outlook on life, the Chinese revolution and the Chinese Communist Party, the Sino-Soviet issue, and youth work, student work, women's issues, etc. Through these reports and repeated discussions, the students obtained the key to learning, especially in learning to establish a revolutionary outlook on life, which was relatively in-depth. After these 2,000 students return to major universities and middle schools, they will be a powerful force in continuing to criticize and transform erroneous ideas in the school's study in the next semester.

Study Group for Graduates of North China Universities—In previous years, the summer vacation was when university graduates rushed around looking for employment, falling into the distress of "graduation equals unemployment." This year, 2,035 university or college graduates from Beiping and Tianjin have already undergone a month of voluntary participation in study, and are rushing to the work posts arranged for them by the People's Government to participate in the construction of the new China.

With Chairman Mao's "On People's Democratic Dictatorship" as the center, revolving around the study of issues such as class, state, political party, and the nature and path of the Chinese revolution, coupled with the important reports of leading comrades, everyone initially learned the ideological preparations that should be made in the work post. Further improvement of ideological understanding awaits their continued tempering and overcoming in practical work.

Party Member Training Class—This was organized by the Organization Department of the CPC Beiping Municipal Committee. Most of those studying here were Party members, Youth League members, and a small number of progressive masses from Beiping universities and middle schools, including students, professors, lecturers, teaching assistants, staff members, doctors, nurses, etc., totaling more than 730 people. Before the liberation of Beiping, most of them participated in the anti-American and anti-Chiang struggle, but because they had been engaged in underground activities for a long time, they could not receive systematic education from the Party, lacked a clear class viewpoint and firm stand, and were not very familiar with the basic knowledge related to Party building. They had long yearned for this kind of training and study.

Over the past month, they have generally been able to learn to use the weapon of class analysis, criticize their non-proletarian ideology, analyze and criticize the motives for joining the Party and participating in the revolution, and have taken a step forward ideologically; secondly, through studying the Party Program, the Party Constitution, and the cultivation of Communist Party members, the general Communist Party members have consolidated and deepened their love for the Party, while the Youth League members and the masses have expressed their desire to strive to join the Party; finally, through studying the work of school branches and the exchange and summary of experiences in various schools, a foundation has been laid for the improvement of school work in the next semester.

Youth League School Cadre Study Meeting—The Youth League School Cadre Study Meeting actually played the role of an expanded cadre meeting of the Youth League's school work in Beiping City. The students were Youth League branch committee members from major universities and middle schools, cadres of student unions from various middle schools, and political instructors from various middle schools, totaling more than 500 people. They mainly studied the reports on Youth League work in schools and student work in Beiping City made by Jiang Nanxiang, Deputy Secretary of the Central Committee of the Youth League, and Xu Liqun, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Youth League in Beiping City. They generally summarized the work achievements of various schools in the last semester, exchanged the experiences of various schools, and clarified that the future direction and tasks of student work are to carry out New Democratic study in various schools. Study must be useful for New Democratic construction, and the methods and spirit of New Democracy must be implemented. It is not to restore the old study, but to conduct critical study with correct viewpoints, and more clearly resolved the contradictions between work and study, and the contradictions between academic study and political study in student work in the last semester. In addition, in terms of the work style of the Youth League, they analyzed and criticized arrogance and complacency, distrust of the masses, failure to correctly play an exemplary role, and failure to unite the masses in criticizing erroneous ideas and engaging in irreconcilable struggles with them. They also summarized the deviations in the development of the Youth League and proposed ways to overcome them. The time was only ten days, but preliminary solutions were obtained for many problems in the work.

The study meetings for teachers and staff of primary and secondary schools already have a special summary (see the newspaper on the 5th), which will not be repeated here.

In addition, more than 1,500 elementary school students participated in the Children's Paradise; more than 300 university and middle school students went to factories to tutor workers in cultural and political courses; more than 800 university science and engineering students went to the Northeast and North China for internships; more than 100 university and middle school students participated in industrial and commercial surveys, social surveys, court trials, book sorting at the Beiping Library, etc.; and a small number stayed in school to catch up on their studies and experiments; university faculty and staff also organized themselves to study.

Now the summer vacation is coming to an end, and teachers and students from various schools are returning to school one after another, enthusiastically talking about the gains of the summer vacation, and unanimously believe that this is the first time in their lives that they have spent such a happy and fulfilling summer vacation.

　　暑假中的平市师生们
  　记平市两万余师生的暑期学习
    陈泓　王金凤
    北平解放以来的第一个暑期中，有两万三千多名学校师生，参加了集体学习，其中包括一万六千六百余名大、中学学生及党员、团员，五千八百余名中、小学教师。这次暑期学习主要是针对了相当普遍地存在于知识分子中的思想问题，如超阶级的思想，走中间路线的个人自由主义思想，反国际主义的思想以及对历史、对革命的错误看法等。一个多月以来的学习，对上述思想一般均从劳动观点与阶级观点上做了初步解决。学习中贯彻了理论与实际结合的方法，联系自己思想检讨，并充分发挥了自由思想与放手发扬民主讨论的精神。许多党的及各方面负责同志，如彭真、薄一波、徐特立、刘澜涛、胡乔木、艾思奇、钱俊瑞、冯文彬、蒋南翔等都亲自讲课，对学员帮助极大。参加学习者绝大部分都获得很大进步；初步建立了革命的人生观，坚定了为人民服务的决心，更进一步加强了对中国共产党和人民政府的了解，大大增进了他们与中国共产党的联系。仅在青年学园和大、中学生暑期学习团两个学习组织内，即有一千三百八十余同学加入新民主主义青年团，很多党、团员干部联系实际学习了工作方法，加强了群众观点，许多同学在工厂及其他实际工作岗位上得到了锻炼，都觉得这个暑期的收获，是空前丰富的。许多人在学习结束时，觉得时间过得太快，依依不舍。兹将各学习组织情况简述如后：
    青年学园—由新民主主义青年团北平市筹委会和北平学联举办的“青年学园”，是适合北平学生需要的，锻炼身心的最好园地。参加学习的是大中学同学，完全根据自愿来选择课程和参加活动。参加者有一万一千四百余人。在这里，各种青年讲座如“劳动创造世界”、“青年人怎样认识新世界”、“个人与集体”、“从布拉格归来”、“长征故事”、“莫斯科的五月”、“苏联生活漫谈”等等，先后举办了六十一次。并举办了文化补习，每周共开课达三百六十班，参加听课的有八千人。就这样同学们的政治、文化水平在暑假中不断的提高了。学园里普遍的设立图书馆、游艺室，组织了舞蹈班、歌咏队。并展开了各种文娱活动。如集体观影、联欢晚会、半日劳动、旅行参观和文工团的演出等等，更使学园充满了生动活泼的气氛。在学园结业式新颖的运动会上，人们可以清晰的看出解放后学生生活的新气象，如象征红军斗争史的男子八百公尺接力赛跑，表示在红星照耀下前进的五星赛跑，都是生动而富有教育意义的节目；“民主青年集体操”、大秧歌、滑翔机模型表演，也都发挥了集体精神和表现了解放后青年人的朝气蓬勃与创造精神。
    经过三十六天的学习，听了“劳动创造世界”和“五种生产方式——阶级斗争”的讲座，参加了“半日劳动”，同学们纠正了过去卑视劳动的错误观念。新知识的灌输和集体生活的薰陶，使同学们在愉快不知不觉的进步了。在学园结束时，八百八十多个优秀青年被批准加入青年团。
    大中学生暑期学习团——这也是新民主主义青年团北平市筹委会和学联会同主办的。参加学习团的二千学员中有半数是团员。二千人里，大学生占三分之一。学习团开始集中力量学习唯物史观的两个基本观点——劳动观点和阶级观点，并由此认识了世界、中国和知识分子的前途。在学习的后半段，转为学习青年工作——团结与教育一代青年的本领，以求联系学校中实际的团的工作。在学习团开始时，团员和同学对于学习目的、学习方法等等都是不大正确的，但在学习开始时，领导上就严格指出要反对教条主义的学习方法，并特别强调发扬民主、联系实际和批评自我批评的方法。一个月的经验证明，这种学习方法是使学员们在短期内有丰富收获的重大原因。
    学习团先后听了各方面负责同志关于历史唯物论、革命人生观、中国革命与中国共产党、中苏问题和青年工作、学生工作、妇女问题等十几次大报告，通过这些报告经过反复的讨论，同学们取得了学习的钥匙，特别是在学习建立革命人生观方面，比较深入些。这两千同学，回到各大、中学校之后，在下学期学校的学习中继续批评改造错误思想上将是一支有力的队伍。
    华北各大学毕业生学习团—往年的暑假正是大学毕业生到处为就业奔走，陷入“毕业即失业”的苦闷中的时候。在今年，二千零三十五个平津两地大学或专科毕业的学生已经过一个月自愿参加的学习，奔赴人民政府为他们安排好的工作岗位，参加新中国的各项建设工作。
    以毛主席的“论人民民主专政”为中心，围绕着阶级、国家、政党和中国革命的性质和道路这几个问题的学习，配合了领导同志的重要报告，使大家初步学习到工作岗位上应有的思想准备。思想认识的进一步提高，有待于他们在实际工作中去继续锻炼和克服。
    党员训练班—这是中共北平市委会组织部举办的。在这里学习的大部分是北平大中学的党员、团员和一小部分进步的群众，包括学生、教授、讲师、助教、职员、医生、护士等共七百三十余人。北平解放前，他们大多数参加过反美反蒋的斗争，但因长期处在地下活动，不能受到党的有系统的教育，缺乏明确的阶级观点和坚定的立场，也不大熟悉有关党的建设的各项基本知识。他们很早就渴望着这种训练和学习。
    一个多月来，一般都能学习运用阶级分析的武器，批判自己非无产阶级的思想意识，分析批判了入党和参加革命的动机，在思想上提高了一步；其次通过学习党纲、党章和共产党员修养等，一般共产党员巩固了和加深了对党的热爱，团员和群众则纷纷表示要争取入党；最后通过学习学校支部工作和各校经验的交流与总结，为下学期学校工作的提高打下了基础。
    青年团学校干部学习会—青年团学校干部学习会实际上起了青年团北平市学校工作扩大干部会议的作用，学员是各大、中学的青年团支部委员、各中学学生会的干部和各中学的政治教员共五百多人。主要是学习了青年团中央委员会副书记蒋南翔和青年团北平市筹委会主任许立群所作的关于学校中青年团工作和北平市学生工作的报告，概括总结了上学期各校的工作成绩，交流了各校的经验，明确了今后学生工作的方针与任务是在各校展开新民主主义的学习，学习须对新民主主义建设有用，还须贯彻新民主主义的方法和精神，不是恢复旧学习，而是进行以正确的观点批判地学习，更明确地解决了上学期学生工作中工作与学习的矛盾，功课学习与政治学习的矛盾诸问题。此外在团的作风上，分析批判了骄傲自大，不信任群众，未能正确地起模范作用，不善于在批判错误思想及和它做不调和的斗争中团结群众。又总结了团的发展中的偏向，提出了克服的办法。时间只十天，但对工作中的许多问题获得初步解决。
    中、小学教职员学习会已经有了专门的总结（见五日本报），这里不再赘述了。
    此外，有一千五百余小学生参加了儿童乐园；三百多大中学生到工厂为工人补习文化和政治课程，八百多大学理工科学生分赴东北和华北实习，一百多大中学生分别参加工商调查、社会调查、法院审判、北平图书馆图书整理等工作，另有一小部分留校补习功课和实验；各大学教职员也分别组织起来进行学习。
    现在暑期已将结束，各校师生正纷纷返校，热烈交谈着暑期收获，一致认为这是有生以来第一次度过这样愉快而充实的暑假。
