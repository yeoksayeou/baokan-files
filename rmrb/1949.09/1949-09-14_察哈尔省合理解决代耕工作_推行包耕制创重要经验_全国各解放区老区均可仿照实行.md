The following is based on the situation in the Jianping, Yanbei, and Yishui sub-districts (of which Jianping and Yishui sub-districts have now been划归 assigned to Hebei Province) of Chahar Province. This year, the substitute farming work has achieved great results and created important experiences, which are worth imitating and implementing in the old revolutionary base areas of all liberated areas nationwide. It is now introduced as follows: In the Yishui sub-district, 70% of the areas have completed substitute farming or are being liberated. Jianping sub-district has also vigorously launched a campaign for substitute farming. Therefore, in most of the old revolutionary base areas, the substitute farming work that has not been thoroughly implemented for several years has now been basically and appropriately resolved. This is one of the remarkable achievements in this year's production work. Jianping sub-district mainly promoted the contract-output and contract-based contract farming system. According to the implementation situation in Jianping, Pingshan, Jingxing, and Quyang counties in early May, the following is the situation:

Of the 1,225 villages in these four counties, 736 villages have implemented the contract farming system, accounting for more than 60% of the total; 269 villages have determined the substitute farming targets and acreage and are in the process of determining output and signing contracts; only 50 villages in Jianping need occasional labor; and 171 villages have not yet fixed substitute farming. In the fifth district of Lingshou, out of 50 villages, except for one military family that has labor and does not need substitute farming, eight villages in the remaining 49 villages have formulated contract farming methods and inserted a wooden sign on the side of the land receiving substitute farming, stating the acreage, output, contractor, and the names of the martyrs' and military dependents, so that they can be checked at any time. Xingtang, Fuping, and Lingshou counties have also largely completed the work.

The method and process of completion in the fifth district of Jianping are:

一、 First, publicize and explain the benefits of this method through various organizations, and investigate and register the number of martyrs', military, and worker families, land, and labor.

二、 Promote free organization among the masses.

三、 It is best to assess output and sign contracts. This district has a total of 395 households eligible for substitute farming, with 606 mu of irrigated land and 897 mu of dry land. In promoting and organizing substitute farming, Jianping sub-district deployed inspections of previous selfishness in concealing work and misreporting manpower and animal power, and liquidated and summarized the old work, rectified and improved the service system, and implemented strict work recording, equal work, and complete work systems. Due to the in-depth publicity and explanation work in promoting substitute farming, the relationship between the general public and the martyrs' and military dependents has become closer. Therefore, this year's substitute farming work is extremely satisfactory to the martyrs' and military dependents and the broad masses of people, and the results have been seen in production.

The forms of substitute farming in the Yishui sub-district are divided into four types:

一、 Contract labor system: That is, assessing the number of mu and labor hours of martyrs' and military dependents that should be substitute farmed, and allowing them to find their relatives or others to implement fixed contract labor under the principle of mutual voluntariness. The substitute farmer reduces other services based on the number of labor hours.

二、 Contract planting system: Largely the same as the Jianping sub-district method.

三、 Labor ticket system: After determining the number of labor hours of martyrs' and military dependents that should be substitute farmed, labor tickets are issued. When needed, they can be used to collect daily rice from the village office (generally five to six jin per labor hour); the rice is distributed according to the total labor force of the village. If the martyrs' and military dependents actively engage in production and save labor tickets, they can also receive rice. This method is basically a method of substituting grain for labor and is very popular.

四、 Assignment system: Assigning labor occasionally. This method is the worst and mostly exists in new districts or villages with a poor work base.

The forms of substitute farming in the Yanbei sub-district are roughly divided into three types: namely, contract labor, contract planting, and assignment. Among them, contract labor is the most popular, but its promotion is still limited. In addition, the Dajian village in Lingqiu uses cooperatives to solve substitute farming, and the reported method is also very good.

The issues that should be paid attention to in the current substitute farming work are:

一、 Combine substitute farming work with organizing and promoting the production of martyrs' and military dependents to enhance their enthusiasm for self-reliance.

二、 After determining the method, it must be carefully checked and implemented.

三、 All localities are required to gradually change the assignment system and combine it with the rectification of village-level work.

四、 Timely summarize existing experiences, promote the correct ones, and revise shortcomings and errors.

### 察哈尔省合理解决代耕工作　推行包耕制创重要经验  全国各解放区老区均可仿照实行

　　察哈尔省合理解决代耕工作
　  推行包耕制创重要经验
    全国各解放区老区均可仿照实行
    【本报讯】据察哈尔省建屏、雁北、易水三个分区（其中建屏、易水分区现已划归河北省）各县的情况，今年代耕工作均有很大成绩，创造了重要经验，值得全国各解放区的老区仿照实行。现介绍如下：易水分区已有百分之七十的地区，作好代耕，或正在解放；建屏分区也大力突击了代耕工作，故在老区的大部地区，把数年来执行不彻底的代耕工作，现已基本上适当合理地解决了；这是今年生产工作中显著成绩之一。建屏分区主要是推行了包产量、订合同的包耕制。据五月初建屏、平山、井陉、曲阳四县推行情形如下：
    该四县共计一千二百二十五村，已实行包耕制的有七百三十六村，占总数百分之六十以上；已确定了代耕对象和亩数，正在定产量、订合同的二百六十九村；要零工的只是建屏有五十村；尚未固定代耕的一百七十一村。灵寿五区共五十村，除一村军属有劳力不需代耕外，其余四十九村中，已有了八村订好包耕办法，并在受代耕地边插一木牌书明地亩、产量、包耕人与烈、军属姓名，以便随时检查。行唐、阜平、灵寿三县也已大部完成。
    建屏五区完成的方法与过程是：
    一、通过各组织首先宣传解释这一办法的好处，并调查登记烈、军、工属户数、土地与劳力。
    二、推动群众自由组织。
    三、最好评产量、订合同，该区共计应受代耕户三百九十五户，代耕水地六百零六亩，旱地八百九十七亩。建屏分区在推行组织代耕中，布置检查以往瞒工、匿报人畜力的本位主义，并清算总结了旧工，整顿健全了勤务制度，实行了严格记工、平工、齐工等制度，并由于推行代耕中宣传解释工作的深入，因而更密切了一般群众与烈、军属的关系。所以今年的代耕工作，烈、军属和广大群众均极满意，在生产中已见成效。
    易水分区代耕的形式共分四种：
    一、包工制：即评定烈、军属应代耕的亩数和工数，由其自找其亲朋或他人，在双方自愿原则下实行固定包工。代耕者以工数减免其他勤务。
    二、包种制：大体同于建屏分区办法。
    三、工票制：确定应代耕的烈、军属工数后，发给工票，用时凭票到村公所支领日米（一般的每工是五斤至六斤）；其米按全村劳动力摊派。烈、军属如积极生产，省了工票，也可领米。这种办法基本上是以粮代工的办法，颇受欢迎。
    四、派工制：零要零派。这种办法最坏，多系新区或工作基础差的村有之。
    雁北分区代耕形式大体分三种：即包工、包种和派工。其中以包工最受欢迎，但推行尚少。此外，灵邱大涧村用合作社解决代耕，据报办法亦甚好。
    目前代耕工作应注意的问题是：
    一：把代耕工作与组织推动烈、军属生产结合起来，以提高烈、军、工属自谋生活的积极性。
    二、确定办法后，必须认真检查和贯彻。
    三、各地均要求逐步改变派工制，结合整顿村级工作。
    四、及时总结已有经验，发扬正确的，修改缺点和错误。
