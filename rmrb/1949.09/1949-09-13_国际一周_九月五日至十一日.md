International Week
September 5th to 11th

The People of the World Unite and Fight Resolutely Against War

As the International Day of Struggle for Peace, announced by the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress for October 2nd, approaches, the movement of people all over the world against war and for peace has developed more and more extensively. The Second World Democratic Youth Congress, symbolizing the great unity of democratic youth worldwide, opened on the 2nd and closed on the 8th. 637 delegates from 71 countries participated in this conference, representing more than 60 million organized young men and women, which means that in the four years since the First Congress, the membership of the World Federation of Democratic Youth has doubled. Following the work report of the Chairman of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, Bo Andersson, and the discussion on the 3rd, the conference heard an important report on the 4th from Mikhailov, the head of the Soviet delegation, "Struggle for Peace, Democracy, National Independence and the Beautiful Future of Youth". The report pointed out that the Soviet Union is the most resolute defender of peace and the hope of mankind, and described in vivid contrast the intense and happy life of Soviet youth, while American and British imperialism are the main enemies of the people and all youth. The report pointed out that the Soviet Union is the vanguard of democratic forces all over the world, and to defend the cause of peace is to consolidate the friendship and cooperation of all democratic forces with the Soviet Union. Mikhailov finally assured the conference that Soviet youth would contribute all their efforts to strengthening the unity of democratic youth. The conference continued to discuss Bo Andersson's report on the 5th, 6th and 7th. At the closing meeting on the 8th, the conference adopted a declaration and resolutions, and elected a new leadership, the Council of the World Federation of Youth, headed by Bo Andersson (Chairman, France), Mikhailov (Vice-Chairman, Soviet Union) and Liao Chengzhi (Vice-Chairman, China), and stipulated that the alliance's motto is: "Youth unite, advance, strive for lasting peace, strive for democracy, and strive for the national independence and a bright future for the people of all countries!" The conference also passed November 10th as World Youth Day. At the same time, despite various obstacles from the governments of the United States, Brazil, and other countries, the American Peace Congress opened in Mexico City on the 5th. The conference brought together more than 1,000 delegates representing various American countries. At the plenary meetings and group discussions held in recent days, the delegates unanimously pointed out that lasting peace cannot be achieved by passive pacifism, but must be actively fought for, exposing the warmongers and mobilizing the broad masses of the people to rise up and fight for it. The sinful activities of the United States and a few other warmongers not only threaten world peace and human culture, but also primarily threaten the independence of Latin American countries. The people of Latin America have expressed through this conference their determination not to allow their countries to become colonies of Wall Street. They have merged the struggle for independence, freedom, and democracy with the entire world peace movement led by the Soviet Union. At the same time, the convening of the conference on the American continent, which is tightly controlled by the United States, not only proves that the true democratic forces of the American people are uniting, but also proves the fragility and instability of the American imperialist rear. The people of the entire Americas will establish a permanent Pan-American Peace Committee through this conference to unify the people of the Americas in their daily struggle against war and for peace. In addition, the French people are preparing to hold peace demonstrations and peace votes throughout France in preparation for the International Day of Struggle for Peace. On September 2nd, a grand rally was held in the Mutual Aid Hall in Paris, presided over by the Chairman of the French Communist Party, Thorez. On the 4th, the French Communist Party's L'Humanit√© held its annual meeting, attended by more than one million people. This conference became a powerful demonstration of the solidarity of the French working people in the struggle for peace. The French Veterans' Peace Congress also met on the 3rd, and one of the prominent slogans at the meeting was: "September 3, 1939 - General Mobilization for War; September 3, 1949 - General Mobilization for Peace".

U.S. Imperialism's Economic Situation is Increasingly Treacherous, Plotting to Smash the Entire Sterling Area

In sharp contrast to the rising and united forces of people around the world striving for peace is the increasingly sharp intensification of contradictions and infighting within the imperialist camp. Due to the shameful failure of the Marshall Plan and the increasingly treacherous economic situation in the capitalist world, both the United States and Britain are trying to extricate themselves from this inescapable predicament. The so-called US-UK-Canada financial conference, which began in Washington on September 7, was held against this background. Prior to the meeting, Pravda published a special article stating: "The contradiction between the United States and Britain is manifested in the struggle between the dollar and the pound. American capital has launched a resolute offensive against the sterling area, vigorously promoting the devaluation of the pound, smashing the entire sterling area, and establishing the unique dominance of the dollar states, thereby greatly expanding the market for American goods and freeing itself from the threat of crisis, or at least weakening the impact of the crisis." On the British side, the increase in the dollar deficit and the rapid depletion of gold reserves reflect the deepening of the economic crisis. Slight struggles immediately aroused the fury of the American ruling class. The Labor government is reaping the consequences of its policy of relying on Wall Street's monopoly capital. Of course, the Attlee and Bevin clique will continue their policy of drinking poison to quench their thirst, begging for US loans again, and sinking deeper into the shackles of dollar rule, but "no matter what the outcome of the Washington negotiations, and no matter who benefits more from the mutual blackmail, this negotiation cannot solve the increasingly deepening contradictions between the United States and Britain, nor can it prevent the continued aggravation of this contradiction" (Pravda), can be asserted.

The U.S. and Britain are Intensifying Efforts to Disrupt the Far East and Sending Aggressive Envoys to Engage in Activities Everywhere

In the Far East, U.S. imperialism continues to support Japanese militarism and instigate the so-called Pacific Anti-Communist Alliance. U.S. Undersecretary of the Army Voorhees flew to Tokyo on August 29 and held secret talks with MacArthur. According to a United Press report, "Voorhees may be most familiar with the desire of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff to establish a security zone around China." This news revealed the U.S. imperialist attempt to intensify the blockade of China's coastal areas and continue to disrupt the New China. British High Commissioner for Southeast Asia MacDonald also arrived in Japan from Singapore on September 3, and it is reported that one of his tasks is to "militarily ascertain the extent to which the U.S. military in the Far East can prevent the expansion of communism outside China." This incident shows that British imperialism has also participated in the conspiracy against the Chinese people and the entire Far Eastern people. At the same time, the U.S. Congressional Investigation Team, headed by Huber, arrived in Tokyo on the 5th and will conduct a 40-day "trip" to South Korea, the Philippines, Burma, Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore, and the Pacific islands under U.S. control. According to reports, Huber and his party will meet with MacArthur after arriving in Japan "to directly obtain MacArthur's opinions on the development of the Far East situation and the situation in China," and will also "study whether it is appropriate to conclude a Pacific Treaty aimed at protecting Southeast Asia from communism." At the same time, the followers of American and British imperialism in the East are also intensifying their activities. According to Manila reports, countries participating in the so-called Pacific Alliance may meet in Baguio early next year. On the other hand, Thai military fascist leader Luang Phibuns issued invitations on the 6th, suggesting that the governments of India, Burma, and the Philippines go to Bangkok in November or December for a four-nation meeting to "explore the sentiments of Asian governments regarding possible mutual anti-communist alliances" (Reuters). At the same time, Luang Phibuns continues his anti-Chinese atrocities in the country. The activities of imperialist aggressive envoys and their lackeys in the Far East show how panicked and chaotic the US-British group is in the face of the victory of the Chinese people and the increasingly powerful liberation movement of the oppressed nations in the East.

The U.S. Imperialism Instigates Fascist Violence, Which is Fiercely Criticized at Home and Abroad

After the U.S. government instigated fascist elements to attack the Robeson concert in Peekskill, New York, on August 27, it caused a second act of violence in the same place on September 4. On that day, Robeson sang in front of at least 25,000 listeners. 3,000 worker volunteers stood shoulder to shoulder around the open-air plaza to protect Robeson. Disregarding the threats of fascist thugs along the way, hundreds of cars and buses carried a steady stream of listeners, and the concert actually became a demonstration. Seeing that their despicable conspiracy could not succeed, the reactionaries began to attack when the audience left the venue, injuring about 150 listeners. Police participated in this atrocity. But the thugs failed to hurt Robeson, let alone achieve their attempt to prevent Robeson from singing in Peekskill. The second atrocity of American fascists aroused the indignation of the broad masses of people at home and abroad. The organizers of the concert, the Civil Rights Congress, protested to Truman and Dewey (Governor of New York). Trade unions and other organizations in various places have also protested. New York City Councilor Davis criticized Dewey for instigating Ku Klux Klan members and veteran terrorists to attack peaceful citizens. On the 8th, a delegation of more than 100 progressive writers, artists, and actors presented a strong petition to the judge and prosecutor during the hearing of American Communist leader Hugh, demanding the dismissal of the lawsuit on the grounds that the Peekskill atrocity was caused by the persecution of the leadership of the American Communist Party by the U.S. government. The delegation declared that the entire United States has now essentially become a large Peekskill. On September 6, the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the National Musicians Association jointly issued a letter of condolences to Robeson and protested against the atrocities of U.S. imperialism, expressing the sympathy and solidarity of the Chinese people with the progressive people of the United States.
