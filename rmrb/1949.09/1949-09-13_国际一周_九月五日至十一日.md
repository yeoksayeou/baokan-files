International Week
September 5th to 11th

The People of the World Unite and Fight Resolutely Against War

As the International Day of Struggle for Peace, announced by the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress for October 2nd, approaches, the movement of people all over the world against war and for peace has developed more and more extensively. The Second World Democratic Youth Congress, symbolizing the great unity of democratic youth worldwide, opened on the 2nd and closed on the 8th. 637 delegates from 71 countries participated in this conference, representing more than 60 million organized young men and women, which means that in the four years since the First Congress, the membership of the World Federation of Democratic Youth has doubled. Following the work report of the Chairman of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, Bo Andersson, and the discussion on the 3rd, the conference heard an important report on the 4th from Mikhailov, the head of the Soviet delegation, "Struggle for Peace, Democracy, National Independence and the Beautiful Future of Youth". The report pointed out that the Soviet Union is the most resolute defender of peace and the hope of mankind, and described in vivid contrast the intense and happy life of Soviet youth, while American and British imperialism are the main enemies of the people and all youth. The report pointed out that the Soviet Union is the vanguard of democratic forces all over the world, and to defend the cause of peace is to consolidate the friendship and cooperation of all democratic forces with the Soviet Union. Mikhailov finally assured the conference that Soviet youth would contribute all their efforts to strengthening the unity of democratic youth. The conference continued to discuss Bo Andersson's report on the 5th, 6th and 7th. At the closing meeting on the 8th, the conference adopted a declaration and resolutions, and elected a new leadership, the Council of the World Federation of Youth, headed by Bo Andersson (Chairman, France), Mikhailov (Vice-Chairman, Soviet Union) and Liao Chengzhi (Vice-Chairman, China), and stipulated that the alliance's motto is: "Youth unite, advance, strive for lasting peace, strive for democracy, and strive for the national independence and a bright future for the people of all countries!" The conference also passed November 10th as World Youth Day. At the same time, despite various obstacles from the governments of the United States, Brazil, and other countries, the American Peace Congress opened in Mexico City on the 5th. The conference brought together more than 1,000 delegates representing various American countries. At the plenary meetings and group discussions held in recent days, the delegates unanimously pointed out that lasting peace cannot be achieved by passive pacifism, but must be actively fought for, exposing the warmongers and mobilizing the broad masses of the people to rise up and fight for it. The sinful activities of the United States and a few other warmongers not only threaten world peace and human culture, but also primarily threaten the independence of Latin American countries. The people of Latin America have expressed through this conference their determination not to allow their countries to become colonies of Wall Street. They have merged the struggle for independence, freedom, and democracy with the entire world peace movement led by the Soviet Union. At the same time, the convening of the conference on the American continent, which is tightly controlled by the United States, not only proves that the true democratic forces of the American people are uniting, but also proves the fragility and instability of the American imperialist rear. The people of the entire Americas will establish a permanent Pan-American Peace Committee through this conference to unify the people of the Americas in their daily struggle against war and for peace. In addition, the French people are preparing to hold peace demonstrations and peace votes throughout France in preparation for the International Day of Struggle for Peace. On September 2nd, a grand rally was held in the Mutual Aid Hall in Paris, presided over by the Chairman of the French Communist Party, Thorez. On the 4th, the French Communist Party's L'Humanité held its annual meeting, attended by more than one million people. This conference became a powerful demonstration of the solidarity of the French working people in the struggle for peace. The French Veterans' Peace Congress also met on the 3rd, and one of the prominent slogans at the meeting was: "September 3, 1939 - General Mobilization for War; September 3, 1949 - General Mobilization for Peace".

U.S. Imperialism's Economic Situation is Increasingly Treacherous, Plotting to Smash the Entire Sterling Area

In sharp contrast to the rising and united forces of people around the world striving for peace is the increasingly sharp intensification of contradictions and infighting within the imperialist camp. Due to the shameful failure of the Marshall Plan and the increasingly treacherous economic situation in the capitalist world, both the United States and Britain are trying to extricate themselves from this inescapable predicament. The so-called US-UK-Canada financial conference, which began in Washington on September 7, was held against this background. Prior to the meeting, Pravda published a special article stating: "The contradiction between the United States and Britain is manifested in the struggle between the dollar and the pound. American capital has launched a resolute offensive against the sterling area, vigorously promoting the devaluation of the pound, smashing the entire sterling area, and establishing the unique dominance of the dollar states, thereby greatly expanding the market for American goods and freeing itself from the threat of crisis, or at least weakening the impact of the crisis." On the British side, the increase in the dollar deficit and the rapid depletion of gold reserves reflect the deepening of the economic crisis. Slight struggles immediately aroused the fury of the American ruling class. The Labor government is reaping the consequences of its policy of relying on Wall Street's monopoly capital. Of course, the Attlee and Bevin clique will continue their policy of drinking poison to quench their thirst, begging for US loans again, and sinking deeper into the shackles of dollar rule, but "no matter what the outcome of the Washington negotiations, and no matter who benefits more from the mutual blackmail, this negotiation cannot solve the increasingly deepening contradictions between the United States and Britain, nor can it prevent the continued aggravation of this contradiction" (Pravda), can be asserted.

The U.S. and Britain are Intensifying Efforts to Disrupt the Far East and Sending Aggressive Envoys to Engage in Activities Everywhere

In the Far East, U.S. imperialism continues to support Japanese militarism and instigate the so-called Pacific Anti-Communist Alliance. U.S. Undersecretary of the Army Voorhees flew to Tokyo on August 29 and held secret talks with MacArthur. According to a United Press report, "Voorhees may be most familiar with the desire of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff to establish a security zone around China." This news revealed the U.S. imperialist attempt to intensify the blockade of China's coastal areas and continue to disrupt the New China. British High Commissioner for Southeast Asia MacDonald also arrived in Japan from Singapore on September 3, and it is reported that one of his tasks is to "militarily ascertain the extent to which the U.S. military in the Far East can prevent the expansion of communism outside China." This incident shows that British imperialism has also participated in the conspiracy against the Chinese people and the entire Far Eastern people. At the same time, the U.S. Congressional Investigation Team, headed by Huber, arrived in Tokyo on the 5th and will conduct a 40-day "trip" to South Korea, the Philippines, Burma, Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore, and the Pacific islands under U.S. control. According to reports, Huber and his party will meet with MacArthur after arriving in Japan "to directly obtain MacArthur's opinions on the development of the Far East situation and the situation in China," and will also "study whether it is appropriate to conclude a Pacific Treaty aimed at protecting Southeast Asia from communism." At the same time, the followers of American and British imperialism in the East are also intensifying their activities. According to Manila reports, countries participating in the so-called Pacific Alliance may meet in Baguio early next year. On the other hand, Thai military fascist leader Luang Phibuns issued invitations on the 6th, suggesting that the governments of India, Burma, and the Philippines go to Bangkok in November or December for a four-nation meeting to "explore the sentiments of Asian governments regarding possible mutual anti-communist alliances" (Reuters). At the same time, Luang Phibuns continues his anti-Chinese atrocities in the country. The activities of imperialist aggressive envoys and their lackeys in the Far East show how panicked and chaotic the US-British group is in the face of the victory of the Chinese people and the increasingly powerful liberation movement of the oppressed nations in the East.

The U.S. Imperialism Instigates Fascist Violence, Which is Fiercely Criticized at Home and Abroad

After the U.S. government instigated fascist elements to attack the Robeson concert in Peekskill, New York, on August 27, it caused a second act of violence in the same place on September 4. On that day, Robeson sang in front of at least 25,000 listeners. 3,000 worker volunteers stood shoulder to shoulder around the open-air plaza to protect Robeson. Disregarding the threats of fascist thugs along the way, hundreds of cars and buses carried a steady stream of listeners, and the concert actually became a demonstration. Seeing that their despicable conspiracy could not succeed, the reactionaries began to attack when the audience left the venue, injuring about 150 listeners. Police participated in this atrocity. But the thugs failed to hurt Robeson, let alone achieve their attempt to prevent Robeson from singing in Peekskill. The second atrocity of American fascists aroused the indignation of the broad masses of people at home and abroad. The organizers of the concert, the Civil Rights Congress, protested to Truman and Dewey (Governor of New York). Trade unions and other organizations in various places have also protested. New York City Councilor Davis criticized Dewey for instigating Ku Klux Klan members and veteran terrorists to attack peaceful citizens. On the 8th, a delegation of more than 100 progressive writers, artists, and actors presented a strong petition to the judge and prosecutor during the hearing of American Communist leader Hugh, demanding the dismissal of the lawsuit on the grounds that the Peekskill atrocity was caused by the persecution of the leadership of the American Communist Party by the U.S. government. The delegation declared that the entire United States has now essentially become a large Peekskill. On September 6, the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the National Musicians Association jointly issued a letter of condolences to Robeson and protested against the atrocities of U.S. imperialism, expressing the sympathy and solidarity of the Chinese people with the progressive people of the United States.

　　国际一周
    九月五日至十一日
    全世界人民反对战争正团聚力量坚决斗争
    当世界拥护和平大会常委会所宣布的十月二日国际和平斗争日行将到来之际，全世界人民反对战争、拥护和平的运动，已愈来愈广泛地发展了。象征全世界民主青年大团结的第二次世界民主青年代表大会，于二日开幕后，已于八日闭幕。参加这次大会的有七十一国的六百三十七名代表，代表六千万以上的有组织男女青年，这就是说，自第一次代表大会以来的四年中，世界民主青联的会员已增加了一倍。继世界民主青联主席鲍埃逊工作报告及三日会上讨论之后，在四日的会上，大会听取了苏联代表团团长米哈伊洛夫的重要报告——“为和平、民主、民族独立与青年的美好将来而斗争”。报告指出苏联是和平的最坚决保卫者，是人类的希望，并以鲜明的对比详述苏联青年的紧张而幸福的生活，而美英帝国主义则是人民和全体青年的主要敌人。报告指出苏联是全世界民主力量的先锋，保卫和平事业就是要巩固一切民主力量与苏联的友谊和合作。米哈伊洛夫最后向大会保证，苏联青年将全力贡献给加强民主青年团结的事业。大会五、六、七日三天继续讨论鲍埃逊报告。八日的闭幕会上，大会通过了宣言和决议案，选出了以鲍埃逊（主席，法）、米哈伊洛夫（副主席，苏）及廖承志（副主席，中）等为首的新的领导机构——世界青联理事会，规定了联盟的格言是：“青年们团结起来，前进，争取持久和平、争取民主、争取各国人民的民族独立和美好的将来！”大会并通过十一月十日为世界青年日。与此同时，不顾美国、巴西等政府的各种阻挠，美洲和平大会已于五日在墨西哥城开幕，大会集合了代表美洲各国的一千多名代表，在连日进行的全体会议和分组讨论会上，与会代表一致指出，持久和平不能以消极的和平主义获得，而是必须积极斗争，揭露战争贩子，动员广大人民起来争取。美国等少数战争贩子的罪恶活动，不仅威胁着世界和平与人类文化，而且首先威胁着拉丁美洲各国的独立。拉丁美洲人民已通过这个大会，表示了他们决不愿把他们的国家沦为华尔街殖民地的决心，他们已把争取独立自由和民主的斗争，与以苏联为首的整个世界和平运动汇合起来了。同时，大会在这美国所紧紧控制的美洲大陆召开，不仅证明了美洲人民的真正民主力量正在团结起来，而且也证明了美帝国主义后方的脆弱和不稳。全美洲人民将经过这次大会设立全美洲常设的和平委员会，来统一地领导美洲人民进行反对战争、争取和平的日常斗争。此外，法国人民为着迎接国际和平斗争日，正准备在全法各地举行和平示威与和平投票。九月二日，在法共主席多列士主持下在巴黎互助大厅举行了盛大的集会。四日，法国共产党的人道报举行年会，参加者达一百万人以上。这个大会成了法国劳动人民在争取和平的斗争中团结一致的有力示威。法国退伍军人拥护和平大会也在三日集会，会上显著的口号之一是：“一九三九年九月三日——战争总动员；一九四九年九月三日——争取和平总动员”。
    美帝经济情况益险恶图打烂整个英镑集团
    与世界人民争取和平力量的高涨与团结适成鲜明对照的，是帝国主义阵营内部的矛盾与倾轧正日趋尖锐化。由于马歇尔计划的可耻失败和资本主义世界经济情况的益趋险恶，美国和英国在走头无路中都想自己能够摆脱这个无法摆脱的难关。九月七日在华盛顿开始的所谓美英加金融会议，就是在这种背景中举行的。真理报于会前刊载专文说：“美英间的矛盾，表现在美元与英镑的斗争上。美国资本对英镑集团发动了坚决的攻势，力促英镑贬值，打烂整个的英镑集团，并建立美元国家独一无二的统治，从而大大扩张美货的市场，为自己免除危机的威胁，或至少减弱危机的影响”。在英国方面，美元赤字的增加与黄金储备的迅速耗竭，反映出经济危机的深刻化。些微的挣扎立刻招来了美国统治阶级的暴怒。工党政府正自食其依附华尔街独占资本的政策的后果。当然，艾德礼、贝文之流还会继续其饮鸩止渴的政策，再度乞求美国贷款，并更深地陷进美元统治的桎梏里去，但是“不管华盛顿谈判结果如何，也不管谁在相互敲诈中得益较多，这次谈判决不能解决美英之间日益深刻化的矛盾，也不能阻止这一矛盾的继续严重化”（真理报），是可以断言的。
    美英正加紧捣乱远东派侵略使节到处活动
    在远东，美帝国主义继续在扶植日本军国主义，策动所谓太平洋反共联盟。美陆军部次长伍利斯于八月二十九日飞抵东京后与麦克阿瑟进行秘密会谈。据合众社消息透露，“伍利斯对于美国联合参谋部拟在中国四周建立安全区的愿望可能最为熟悉”。这一消息道出了美帝国主义企图加紧中国沿海封锁圈并继续捣乱新中国的野心。英国驻东南亚高级专员麦克唐纳接着也于九月三日自新加坡到达日本，据悉其任务之一便是“在军事上探悉远东美军在中国以外可以阻止共产党扩进的程度”。这件事说明了英帝国主义也参预了反对中国人民和整个远东人民的阴谋计划。与此同时，以胡勃为首的美国会调查小组一行已于五日抵东京，将在南朝鲜、菲律宾、缅甸、泰国、印尼、新加坡及美国控制下的太平洋各岛屿作四十天的“旅行”。据消息透露，胡勃一行抵日后即将与麦克阿瑟会谈“以直接取得麦克阿瑟关于远东局势的发展和中国情势的意见”，并将“研讨是否宜于缔结旨在保护东南亚免于共产主义的太平洋公约问题”。同时，美英帝国主义在东方的追随者们也在加紧活动。据马尼拉方面消息，参加所谓太平洋联盟国家，可能于明年初在碧瑶开会。另一方面，泰国军事法西斯首脑銮披汶则于六日发出请柬，建议印缅菲三国政府于十一月或十二月间赴曼谷举行四国会议，以“探测亚洲各国政府对于可能之相互反共同盟的情绪”（路透社）。同时，銮披汶在国内继续其排华暴行。帝国主义侵略使节和它们在远东走狗们的活动，显示了美英集团在中国人民胜利和东方被压迫民族解放运动日益强大面前，是如何地手忙脚乱，慌作一团。
    美帝怂恿法西斯行凶遭到国内外猛烈抨击
    美国政府怂恿法西斯分子于八月二十七日在纽约毕克斯吉尔镇袭击罗伯逊音乐会后，九月四日又在该地造成第二次暴行事件。当日罗伯逊在至少两万五千听众前歌唱。三千名工人志愿保卫队肩并肩地围住露天广场，保护罗伯逊。不顾沿途法西斯暴徒的威胁，数百辆汽车和公共汽车载着络绎不绝的听众前来，音乐会实际上成了一个示威大会。反动派见卑劣阴谋无法得逞，就在听众离开会场时开始攻击，击伤听众约一百五十名。这次暴行并有警察参加。但暴徒们却未能伤着罗伯逊，更不能实现他们要使罗伯逊不能在毕克斯吉尔歌唱的企图。美国法西斯分子的二度暴行引起了美国国内外广大人民的愤慨。音乐会主持者——民权保障大会向杜鲁门和杜威（纽约州长）提出抗议。各地工会等团体也纷纷提出抗议。纽约市议员戴维斯抨击杜威怂恿三Ｋ党徒及退伍军人恐怖分子袭击和平公民。八日，有一百多名进步作家艺术家和演员的代表团在审讯美共领袖休庭时，向法官和检察官提出强硬请愿书，要求撤销诉讼，理由是毕克斯吉尔暴行事件正是美政府迫害共产党领导机构所引起的。代表团宣告，现在整个美国实质上已经变成一个大毕克斯吉尔了。九月六日，中华全国文学艺术界联合会与全国音乐工作者协会联合发表慰问罗伯逊，抗议美帝国主义暴行书一件，表示了中国人民对美国进步人民的同情声援和休戚与共。　　　　　　　【新华社北平十二日电】
