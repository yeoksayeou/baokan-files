　　Democratic National Construction Association, Peiping Branch
  　Denounces the US Imperialist White Paper
  　Determined to be Vigilant Against US Imperialist Conspiracies, Self-Reliantly Build New China's Industry and Commerce, and Strive for, Educate, and Transform the Industrial and Commercial Masses.
    [Report from this newspaper] The Peiping Branch of the Democratic National Construction Association and the New Intellectuals Symposium led by the association, jointly held a forum on the US White Paper on China at the auditorium of the European and American Alumni Association on Nanheyan Road yesterday (2nd) at 7:30 PM. Members from the industrial and commercial sectors, and cultural and educational circles, including Huang Yanpei, Hu Juewen, Bao Dasan, Zhang [@伯], Yu Huanzheng, Luo Shuzhang, Ling Qijun, Sun Fuling, Wang Xiangchen, Hu Qin Zhi, Tang Qingyong, Bai Tao, and Li Xiude, totaling eighty-seven people, attended. The forum was chaired by Ling Qijun, vice chairman of the association. First, Liu Zunqi from the Xinhua News Agency, invited by the association, introduced the content of the US imperialist White Paper, analyzed and criticized its essence, and explained that our attitude towards democratic individualists should be to strive for, unite, and transform them. Following this, Wang Biao, Ai Zhicheng, Bao Dasan, Zhang [@伯], Wang Yunhua, Yang Weiyu, Liao Zengyi, Wang Xiangchen, Zhang Yunxi, Luo Shuzhang, Li Jinsheng, Shi Fuliang, Ling Qijun, and others expressed their opinions. They unanimously believed that the US imperialist White Paper is a confession of US imperialist aggression against China and a preparation for future aggression against China. The eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan and the three-year War of Self-Defense proved that the Chinese people are not afraid. From now on, they will be more vigilant and self-reliantly build New China's industry and commerce. The US imperialists' conspiracy will absolutely not be realized because people from all walks of life have united and embarked on the path of building a New Democratic country. Attendees also unanimously expressed their commitment to take responsibility for striving for, educating, and transforming the vast masses in the industrial and commercial sectors.
