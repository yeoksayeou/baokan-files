Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, September 9th: The Industry Department of the Northeast Administrative Committee spent more than twenty days conducting an in-depth inspection of the Shenyang Textile Factory, gaining considerable experience. The purpose of this inspection was to systematically understand the factory's situation and further study the problems existing in the implementation of economic accounting in general textile factories, in order to help factory leadership improve production management. The inspection method was mainly based on on-site observation and experiments, combined with studying various statistical reports within the factory. The inspection started with the quality, cost, and output of finished products, and then delved into various production processes and management details for detailed research and experimentation.

The Shenyang Textile Factory currently operates over 11,000 spindles and 360 looms, with 1,151 employees. Monthly output is more than 10,700 bolts of cloth and over 500 bales of yarn. Judging from the progress of more than seven months since the factory was taken over, there has been significant improvement in output, quality, and savings. The output of one loom has increased from 25 yards per day (nine hours) in the past to 35 yards; the yarn output per spindle has increased from 0.29 pounds to 0.42 pounds per day (nine hours). Especially in reducing raw material consumption, the progress is the fastest, already below the standard stipulated by the Textile Administration Bureau. However, all these improvements are still far from the factory's due production efficiency. According to the inspection results, the factory still has some urgent problems to be solved:

(1) Standardization of quality and output and full utilization of equipment and labor efficiency: The Textile Administration Bureau stipulates that the yarn strength standard is 85 pounds, and the twist is 18 (i.e., 18 twists per inch of yarn). But now the average yarn strength is only 73 pounds, the twist is 16.8, and it is uneven, which directly affects the quality of the cloth. The inspection of ten bolts of cloth showed that only one bolt was good, and the rest had more than 20 minor defects. The efficiency of the machines has also not been fully utilized, resulting in low output. The efficiency of the looms is only 70% of their actual maximum efficiency (generally should be above 80%); the spinning machines are only about 90% (generally should be 95%). There are too many people and too few machines, and labor is not fully and rationally utilized. For example, among the 190 people in the weaving workshop, only 38 people watch three machines; according to the actual skills of the workers, they can watch more.

(2) Savings and costs: Although the cost of yarn and cloth in this factory is not higher than other factories, the proportion of management fees and labor costs is too large. According to the statistics in May, the manufacturing and management costs of spinning one bale of 16-count yarn in this factory accounted for 15.89% of the total cost, while the Mudanjiang Textile Factory only accounted for 6.94%. The manufacturing and management cost of weaving one bolt of cloth in the Shenyang Textile Factory is 125,000 Northeast currency, while the Mudanjiang Textile Factory only costs 47,000 yuan. The Shenyang Textile Factory uses an average of 30.15 workers to spin one bale of yarn, while the Mudanjiang Textile Factory only uses 14 workers. Although the consumption of raw materials in this factory is lower than in February, the waste is still very large. According to the inspection results: In the waste cotton that fell on the ground during the operation process in April, May, and June, there were more than 870 pounds of good cotton and 3,351 pounds of yarn ends. Forty triangular belts should be used in a month, but actually fifty were used. In addition, the monthly expenses for stationery, printing, travel expenses, automobiles, horse carriages, and other miscellaneous expenses are also too large.

(3) Wage issues: The current wage system implemented in this factory is piece-rate, but there is egalitarianism in its implementation. For example, the unit price for watching two looms is 0.06 points per yard, the unit price for watching three looms is 0.05325 points, and the unit price for watching four looms is 0.04504 points. The more machines you watch, the lower the unit price, which does not conform to the principle of more pay for more work and violates the spirit of encouraging technical advancement. Another problem with wages is that wages are too high and the wage growth rate exceeds the increase in work efficiency. For example, the average wage in the fine yarn workshop in June was more than 170 points, which is even higher than the average score of heavy industry. For example, the average daily (nine hours) output per spindle in the fine yarn workshop of this factory was 0.381 pounds in April, 0.369 pounds in May, and 0.372 pounds in June. The output did not increase; however, the average wage per person increased sharply from 139.4 points in April to 170.69 points in June. This increase in wages violates the principle of increasing wages according to the increase in work efficiency.

The main reason for the above shortcomings is that the administrative leadership of the factory has not established a clear concept of economic accounting, and is satisfied with the continuous improvement of production after the liberation, and therefore failed to more actively seek faster improvement in all aspects. After this inspection, the factory is re-examining and studying various quotas based on the performance of the machines and the quality of raw cotton; changing the phenomenon of too many people and too few machines; and rationally adjusting wages to meet the requirements of enterprise management.

　　东北行政委员会工业部
  　检查沈阳纺织厂工作
    入手方法：以实地观察和实验为主结合研究厂内各种统计数字
    【新华社沈阳九日电】东北行政委员会工业部以二十多天的时间，对沈阳纺织厂进行了一次深入的检查，获得了不少经验。此次检查的目的在于从系统了解该厂的情况中，进一步研究一般纺织厂目前实行经济核算中所存在着的问题，以帮助工厂领导机构改进生产管理。检查方法主要是根据实地观察和实验，结合研究厂内各种统计表报数字。检查首先从成品的质量、成本、产量着手，然后深入到各个生产过程与管理细节中去详细研究实验。沈阳纺织厂现经常开动纺纱机一万一千多锭，织布机三百六十台，职工一千一百五十一人。月产布一万零七百多匹，纱五百余件。从该厂接收后七个多月的工作进展来看，产量、质量和节约均有显著进步。其一台织布机的产量已从过去每天（九小时）二十五码，提高到三十五码；一个锭子的产纱量每天（九小时）由零点二九磅提高至零点四二磅。特别在减少原料消耗上进步最快，已低于纺织管理局规定的标准。然而所有这些进步，距离该厂应有的生产效能还相差很大。据检查的结果，该厂还存在着一些急待解决的问题：
    （一）质量、产量的标准化与设备、劳动效能的充分发挥问题：纺织管理局规定纱的强力标准为八十五磅，捻度十八个（即一英寸纱捻十八转）。但现在纱的强力平均只有七十三磅，捻度十六点八个，而且不匀，直接影响到布的质量。检查十匹布的结果，只有一匹是好的，其余均有二十余处小毛病。机器效能也未能充分发挥，因而产量亦低。织布机所发挥的效能，仅为其实际最高效能的百分之七十（一般应为百分之八十以上）；纺纱机仅为百分之九十左右（一般应为百分之九十五）。人数多，机子少，劳动力亦未能充分合理运用。如织布场一百九十个人中，看三台机器的只有三十八个人；按工人实际技能，是可以看得更多的。
    （二）节约与成本问题：该厂纱布的成本，目前虽不比其他各厂高，但管理费与人工费的比重却过大。根据五月份的统计，该厂纺一件十六支纱的制造费和管理费，占全部成本的百分之十五点八九，而牡丹江纺织厂仅占百分之六点九四。沈阳纺织厂织一匹布的制造费和管理费为东北币十二万五千元，牡丹江纺织厂却只四万七千元。沈阳纺织厂纺一件纱平均人工为三十点一五人，而牡丹江纺织厂则只用十四个人工。该厂在原料的消耗上，虽比二月间为低，但浪费仍很大。据检查结果：四、五、六月份在操作过程中落地的废花中，共有八百七十多磅好花和三千三百五十一磅纱头。三角皮带一个月只应用四十条，但实际上用了五十条。此外，每月文具、印刷、旅费、汽车、马车等杂费的开支亦太大。
    （三）工资问题：该厂现在实行的工资制度是按件计资，但实行中却有平均主义的毛病。如看两台织布机的一码单价为零点零六分，看三台的为零点零五三二五分，看四台的则为零点零四五零四分。看机器台数越多单价越低，不合多劳多酬的原则，违背了鼓励技术上进的精神。工资问题中的另一毛病是工资过高与工资增长率超过了工作效率的提高。如细纱间的工资，六月份平均为一百七十多分，比重工业的平均分数还高。又如该厂细纱间每锭每日（九小时）的平均产量，四月份为零点三八一磅，五月份为零点三六九磅，六月份为零点三七二磅，产量并未提高；但每人平均工资，则由四月份的一百三十九点四分，突增至六月份的一百七十点六九分。这种工资的提高，违反了依工作效能的增进而提高的原则。
    产生以上缺点的主要原因，是该厂行政领导上没有建立明确的经济核算思想，并满足于该厂在解放后生产不断改进的成绩，因而未能更积极地从各方面求得更快的改进。经此次检查后，该厂正在根据机器的性能、原棉质量，重新审查研究各种定额；改变人多机器少的现象；合理调整工资，以达到企业化的要求。
