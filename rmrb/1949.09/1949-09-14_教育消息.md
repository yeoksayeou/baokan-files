    The Ping City People's Government Education Bureau is establishing people's education centers and newspaper reading rooms in various urban and suburban districts according to plan. By the end of this year, six people's education centers and nine newspaper reading rooms will be established. During the Kuomintang rule, there were only two people's education centers in the city, namely Gulou and Jianlou, and two newspaper reading rooms in the second and third districts, and most of their operations were abandoned. After liberation, in addition to transforming and strengthening the existing people's education institutions, the People's Government Education Bureau also newly established two newspaper reading rooms. Since then, it has continuously built and renovated them. Before mid-September, the city will have five people's education centers and four newspaper reading rooms, namely: the First People's Education Center in Gulou (District 5), the First People's Education Center Branch on Dongsi North Street (District 3), the Second People's Education Center in Jianlou (District 8), the Third People's Education Center in Xixiejie (District 2), and the Fourth People's Education Center in Huoshen Temple, Dongliulichang (District 9); the Third Newspaper Reading Room in Xisi Dingzizjie (District 4), the Fourth Newspaper Reading Room in Dongliushujing Street (District 8), the Fifth Newspaper Reading Room in Huoshen Temple, Chongwai (District 10), and the Sixth Newspaper Reading Room in Zhishanmen Street (District 6). In addition, it is planned to add a new newspaper reading room in each of District 1, District 4, District 5, and District 11, and establish a new people's education center in District 12. It is expected that all of these can be realized before the end of this year. After the establishment of people's education centers or newspaper reading rooms in various districts, they will cooperate in carrying out adult education, running adult literacy classes, or organizing citizens' newspaper reading groups.
