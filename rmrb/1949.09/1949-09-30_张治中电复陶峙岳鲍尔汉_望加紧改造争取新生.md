Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 29th: General Zhang Zhizhong telegraphed Tao Zhiyue and Bao Erhan today, stating:

To General Tao Zhiyue and Mr. Bao Erhan in Dihua:

I have received and read your telegrams. I am very pleased that you announced on the 25th and 26th of this month that you are severing relations with the reactionary government in Guangzhou and are willing to accept the leadership of the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission and the General Headquarters of the People's Liberation Army. Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu have already replied with their approval. I believe that the people of the whole country, especially the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang, will warmly welcome your glorious action of resolutely leading your troops to revolt. However, regarding your statement in the telegram about my "wise leadership," I am ashamed to accept the word "wise" and have deleted it. Other similar phrases have also been appropriately shortened.

In the past few months, I have been completely in seclusion, reflecting on my past mistakes. In the past thirty years, I deeply feel that in my tenure as the head of military and political affairs in the four northwestern provinces, especially in Xinjiang, there was more demerit than merit, or at most, the merits and demerits offset each other. In the good aspects, it seems that: First, under the erroneous ruling policies of successive central governments towards Xinjiang—conquest, oppression, and exploitation—the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang completely lost their rights to freedom and equality and had no political status. After I arrived in Xinjiang, based on the principle of ethnic equality and in accordance with the peace agreement, I reorganized the provincial government and established a democratic coalition government representing all ethnic groups. Popular elections were implemented for provincial and county councilors, commissioners, and county magistrates. All civil servants at the provincial and county levels were replaced by local people of all ethnic groups. All past phenomena of "Great Han Chauvinism" and "everything being handled by Han people" have gradually been eliminated. The political status and democratic rights of all minority ethnic groups have indeed undergone an unprecedented transformation. Second, Sino-Soviet amity has always been my consistent advocacy, but the Nanjing government was anti-Soviet, and the conservative forces in the province were anti-Soviet. Amidst the contradictions of internal and external attacks, I still resisted all difficulties and insisted on a pro-Soviet policy. This is the main guarantee for peace and stability in the new province and is of the utmost importance. Third, Xinjiang was originally a poor province, and coupled with the exploitation by the ruling class in the past, the people's lives were very difficult. After I arrived in Xinjiang, I first focused on reducing the burden on the people, exempting and reducing taxes, sparing no effort; conscription of soldiers and grain was never carried out; the military's food, salaries, and clothing were mostly allocated by the central government, and even when it was necessary to obtain supplies from the local area, payment was always made at the assessed value. This policy could not be done in any other province in the interior. Fourth, based on historical analysis, I deeply realized the errors of past policies towards Xinjiang and the sins committed by a few Han people in Xinjiang. The resistance and revolutionary activities of the various ethnic minorities in the province were justified. Therefore, I was determined that "I came to Xinjiang to correct historical errors and repay historical debts." Based on this pure and correct understanding, I always adopted a patient and tolerant attitude, resolving all disputes, turning big issues into small ones, and small issues into nothing. Although I was thus criticized by the Han people in Xinjiang, especially by many party, government, and military cadres in Nanjing and Xinjiang, being deemed "too soft" and that "Xinjiang will be lost if this continues," I still insisted on this peaceful policy without the slightest hesitation. This seemed to require considerable tolerance and judgement.

Self-Criticism of Actions in Xinjiang
Provided for Tao, Bao, and Others to Refer to for Reflection

As for the shortcomings, there are many, at least the following: First, leniency towards conservative elements. In order to "strengthen ethnic unity," I once attempted to have radical and conservative elements work together. I advised the radical elements, especially the progressive elements of the Ili faction, that the main feature of so-called democratic politics is the ability to tolerate the existence of the opposition, failing to see the distinction between progressive and backward forces, which instead increased the instability of the situation in the province. This was of course influenced by bourgeois democratic thought and limited by the fundamental contradiction of the nature of the Kuomintang regime, but now it seems to be completely wrong. Second, when I firmly resigned from the concurrent position of provincial chairman and recommended the Uyghur Mesut to succeed me, my reasons were: First, Han people are a minority in the province, and I should not hold the position of chairman for a long time. Second, the Uyghur ethnic group is the majority ethnic group in the province, and the chairman should be a Uyghur who can be approved by the central government, and at that time only Mesut was eligible. In addition, I also had a somewhat resentful mentality. I believed that in the internal struggles of the province, I was often misunderstood by both sides, especially by the Ili faction, and turned into a target of attack. I was tired of it, so I decided to withdraw decisively and let them do it themselves! This moment of error made the power of the conservative faction even more prominent and also deepened the internal contradictions of the Uyghur ethnic group. Third, although the pain of the people of Xinjiang was alleviated in a passive way as described above, the work of actively promoting economic construction and fundamentally improving and raising the people's living standards was obviously not done enough, and even though there were plans, they were not implemented at all. This was certainly due to many objective reasons, but it cannot be denied that there was insufficient subjective effort. Fourth, although promoting Sino-Soviet friendship was a set policy and efforts had been made to do so, conservative elements in various ethnic groups still had a fear of and anti-Soviet consciousness, which was often reflected in their words and actions. Although we corrected them at any time, anti-Soviet incidents continued to occur, especially in the Kashgar area. This is something I deeply regret.

The above is my self-criticism of my three years in charge of military and political affairs in Xinjiang. You have had the same positions and views as me in the past, so I especially provide it for your reference and reflection. How should we thoroughly correct our shortcomings in the future, especially the attitude of being fair and detached from the internal ethnic disputes in the past, which actually included a bias; today, it is clear that we are taking the middle road, which cannot be in line with the viewpoint of people's democratic dictatorship and should be abandoned. All other old consciousness, old viewpoints, and old styles should be abandoned at the same time. Under the correct leadership of the Central People's Government and Chairman Mao, intensify study and strive for transformation sincerely and resolutely; transform yourselves, and transform all officers and soldiers of the troops and all public servants and teachers in the province; clarify your thoughts and strive for a new life. I have nothing to congratulate you on this glorious uprising, so I offer my mutual encouragement as a salute to your new life!

　  张治中电复陶峙岳鲍尔汉
  　望加紧改造争取新生
    【新华社北京二十九日电】张治中将军于本日电复陶峙岳鲍尔汉称：迪化陶峙岳将军，鲍尔汉先生：有电诵悉。你们已于本月二十五、二十六日先后宣布和广州反动政府断绝关系，愿意接受中国人民革命军事委员会和人民解放军总部的领导，我很感欣慰。毛主席朱总司令已有复电赞许。我想，全国人民，特别是新疆各族人民，对你们毅然率部起义这一光荣的行动，必表示热烈欢迎。不过你们来电说到由于我的“贤明领导”的话，“贤明”两字我受之有愧，已经删去了。其他类似性质的词句，也酌予删节。
    这几个月来，我完全在闭门思过——过去三十年来的种种错误，我深切感到最近三年在主持西北四省军政，尤其是新疆军政这一历程中，实在是过多于功，最多功过相抵。就如在好的方面，似乎有：一、在历代中央政府对新疆的错误的统治政策——征服、压迫、剥削——下面，新疆各民族人民完全丧失了自由平等的权利，政治上毫无地位。我到新以后，一本民族平等的原则，根据和平协定，改组省政府，成立各民族代表的民主联合政府。实行省县参议员、专员、县长民选。省县各级公务人员一律改由本地各族人士接充。所有过去“大汉族主义”“一切由汉人包办”的现象，均已逐渐消除。各少数民族的政治地位和民主权利，确已得到空前的转变。二、中苏亲善是我生平一贯的主张，可是南京政府是反苏的，省内保守力量是反苏的，在内外夹攻的矛盾中，我还是力排万难坚持亲苏政策。这是新省和平安定的主要保证，关系最大。三、新疆原是一个贫瘠的省份，再加过去统治阶级的多方剥削，人民生活甚苦。我到新以后，首先着眼在减轻人民的负担，免捐减税，不遗余力；征兵征粮，迄未举办；军队粮饷被服，大部配给中央，即有必需取给地方时，一定按值付款。这一政策是内地任何省份所办不到的。四、根据历史的分析，我深深地体认到历代对新省政策的错误，和少数汉人在新省种下的罪恶，省内各少数民族的反抗和革命活动是应该的，所以我抱定“我到新疆来是为纠正历史的错误，偿还历史的罪债”。基于这种我认为是正确的、纯洁的认识，所以始终采取忍耐和宽大的态度，对于一切纠纷，无不大事化小，小事化无。虽然我因此备受在新汉人，特别是在南京和在新许多党政军干部的责难，被认为“太软弱”，“这样下去，必送掉新疆”，而我还是坚持这一和平政策，不稍动摇。这是似乎需要相当的容量和定见的。
    对在新所为作自我批评
    供陶鲍等参证反省
    至于缺点方面，说来甚多，最少有如下各点：一、对保守分子的优容。为了“加强民族团结”，我曾经企图使急进分子和保守分子携手。我劝告急进分子，特别是伊方的前进分子，认为所谓民主政治，主要的特征是能容许反对派的存在，看不清前进力量与落后力量的分野，反而增加省内情况的不安。这固然也是受了资产阶级民主主义思想的影响和国民党政权本质这一基本矛盾的限制，而现在看来，完全是错误的。二、在我坚辞省主席兼职推举维族的麦斯武德继任时，我的理由是：第一、汉人在省内是少数民族，我不应久兼主席。第二、维吾尔族是省内多数民族，应该由维族中能得中央通过的人当主席，而当时只有麦斯武德氏才合选。此外我还存着一种近于负气的心理，我认为省内两派斗争，我常被两方尤其是伊方所误解，转而拿我做攻击目标，我厌倦了，只有断然退出，让他们自己去干吧！这一念之差，使保守一派的力量格外抬头，也加深了维族内部的矛盾。第三、对于新省人民的痛苦，虽然如上所述从消极方面予以减轻，但是对积极方面促进经济建设的工作，从基本上改善并提高人民生活的工作，显然地做得不够，甚至虽有计划而根本没有做，这固然是有许多客观的原因，但不能不承认主观上努力的不够。第四、促进中苏亲善固然是既定政策，而且已经尽力在做，但是各族中的保守分子，仍然存在着惧苏反苏的意识，而且常常反映于言论行动上，我们虽随时予以纠正，但反苏事件层出不已，尤其在喀什方面。这是我深引为遗憾的。
    以上是我主持新省军政三年的自我批评，你们过去和我具有同一的立场和观点，所以特别提供你们参证和反省。今后对于我们的缺点如何彻底地改正过来，特别是过去对民族内部纷争所采取自以为公正超然的态度，其实包括着一种偏向；在今天看来，显然走的是中间路线，和人民民主专政的观点是不能符合的，应该予以抛弃。其他一切的旧意识、旧观点、旧作风，都应该同时抛弃，坚决地诚挚地在中央人民政府和毛主席的正确领导下，加紧学习，努力改造；改造自己。并改造部队全体官兵和全省公教人员；搞通思想，争取新生。我对于你们这一次光荣起义，无以为贺，特以互勉之意，作为你们新生的敬礼！
