　　Building a Barrier of Peace
　　Congratulating the Opening of the American Peace Conference

    The long-planned American Peace Conference opened in Mexico City on the 5th. This is another grand gathering following the World Congress of Partisans of Peace, the All-Soviet Union Conference for the Defense of Peace, the Budapest Youth and Students' Festival, and the peace demonstrations of progressive people in many European countries. It fully demonstrates the united strength of the American people in striving for peace and fully demonstrates the growing power of the world camp for lasting peace and people's democracy headed by the Soviet Union.
    American imperialists have always regarded the Americas as their private preserve, carrying out cruel plunder of the American people to use as capital for their outward expansion and aggression. In addition to exerting great political pressure, in economic terms, American imperialists are using cheap goods to destroy and suffocate the industry and agriculture of American countries, leading to a sharp increase in unemployment and increasing poverty for the people, completely taking the tragic road of colonialism. From countless painful experiences, the American people clearly understand that they cannot embark on the road of peace and democracy and cannot obtain a bright future unless they get rid of the shackles and threats of American imperialism and war-mongers; they understand that only by uniting, only by standing on the side of the Soviet Union and the peace-loving people of the world, can they get rid of the threat of war-mongers and seek their own liberation. The convening of the American Peace Conference, as the Canadian and American women's groups pointed out, is to "build a barrier of peace to resist the instigators of war," which will undoubtedly further strengthen the consolidation and unity of the peaceful forces of the American countries, giving the American and British imperialist war-mongers a serious blow.
    The Chinese people warmly support the peaceful struggle of the American people. We are willing to fight side by side with the American people to strive for lasting peace on both sides of the Pacific and throughout the world.

　　建立和平的屏障
　  祝美洲和平大会开幕
    筹备已久的美洲和平大会，五日在墨西哥京城开幕了。这是继世界和平拥护者大会、全苏拥护和平大会、布达佩斯青年学生联欢大会以及欧洲许多国家进步人民和平示威大会之后又一次盛大的集会，它充分显示了美洲人民为争取和平而团结一致的力量，充分显示了以苏联为首的世界争取持久和平与人民民主阵营的日益强大。
    美帝国主义者一向视美洲为其禁脔，对美洲人民实行残酷的掠夺，以作为它向外扩张与侵略的资本。除了政治上施以极大的压力之外，在经济上美帝国主义者更以用廉价的商品摧毁和窒息着美洲各国的工农业，以致失业人数大增，人民日趋贫困，完全走上了殖民地的悲惨道路。美洲人民从无数的痛苦经验中，清楚的懂得，他们不摆脱美帝国主义和战争贩子的束缚与威胁，便不能走上和平民主的道路，便不能获得美好的未来；他们懂得，只有团结起来，只有站在苏联和世界爱好和平人民的一边，才能摆脱战争贩子的威胁，求得自身的解放。美洲拥护和平大会的召开，正如加拿大和美国妇女团体所指出的，是为了“建立和平的屏障，以抵制战争的挑拨者”，这无疑地将进一步加强美洲各国人民和平力量的巩固团结，给予美英帝国主义战争贩子们以严重的打击。
    中国人民热烈支持美洲人民的和平斗争。愿与美洲人民并肩奋斗，以争取太平洋东西两岸和全世界的持久和平。
