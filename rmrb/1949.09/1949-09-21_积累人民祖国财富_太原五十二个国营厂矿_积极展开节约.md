　　Accumulate the Wealth of the People's Motherland
  　52 State-Owned Factories and Mines in Taiyuan
  　Actively Promote Thrift
    [Taiyuan Electric Dispatch] In order to accumulate wealth for the people's motherland, in mid-July, Lai Jifa, Director of the Taiyuan Industrial Management Bureau, clarified the great significance of practicing thrift for the new China's economic construction at a joint meeting of managers, representatives, and work team leaders of various factories and mines, and called on all employees to promote thrift. Various public factories and mines then formulated plans and actively launched a thrift campaign. As of the end of August, most of the city's 52 state-owned factories and mines had overcome wasteful phenomena and achieved preliminary results in saving. Since the beginning of autumn, Yucai Machinery Factory has used a mixture of 70% machine oil and 30% castor oil instead of pure machine oil. With this alone, an average of 3,000 catties of millet can be saved per month. The sand-turning department of Zhengxing Machinery Factory has established a registration system for materials used in each furnace and finished products. According to an eight-day statistic, more than 4,000 catties of coke and more than 40,000 catties of waste materials and iron slag were saved. Taiyuan Industrial Chemical Company, Northwest Chemical Plant, Taiyuan Cement Plant, Limin Chemical Company, and others have universally launched power-saving initiatives. According to a one-month statistic of Taiyuan Industrial Chemical Company alone, 10,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity were saved, reducing electricity expenses by more than 10,000 catties of millet. Since the implementation of thrift, Taiyuan Flour Company's second factory has saved 180.5 labor-days and 4,200 kilowatt-hours of electricity while producing 16,010 bags of flour in 18 days, overproducing 350 bags of 75-pass flour and 370 bags of corn flour. Since the promotion of thrift in Taiyuan Printing Company, the raw materials saved by the Engineering Department of the first factory alone amounted to more than 7,000 catties of millet. Taiyuan Match Factory and Tobacco Company have greatly reduced costs and improved product quality through thrift. Taiyuan Paper Mill and Northwest Leather Factory have saved a large amount of machine oil and various raw materials for the state in production. The Industrial Management Bureau has once again issued instructions on practicing thrift, requiring that the thrift work of various factories and mines in September continue to be carried out in an organized and planned manner.
