　　American Warmonger Dulles

　　Dulles is among the American reactionaries who have recently been actively supporting the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's joint defense plan and clamoring for continued aid to Chiang Kai-shek. As everyone knows, Dulles was directly denounced as a warmonger by Vyshinsky at the United Nations General Assembly in 1947. He and Vandenberg are the decision-makers of the Republican Party's foreign policy, and he has close ties with the State Department controlled by the Democratic Party. Dulles is an important figure in today's American reactionary camp.

　　John Foster Dulles was born in 1888. After leaving university, he became a lawyer at "Sullivan & Cromwell," one of Wall Street's largest law firms. Dulles initially burrowed into this law firm, which had close ties with major American financial groups, and this had a great relationship with his lifelong reactionary career. We know that lawyers have an important position in the political life of the American bourgeoisie. American financial oligarchs use lawyers to control the government on their behalf. Half to two-thirds of the members of the American Congress are lawyers, and almost all American presidents have been lawyers. Dulles's conservatism, cunning, hypocrisy, reaction, profiteering, and other habits made his masters choose him to be their spokesperson. Dulles established close relationships with major companies such as Standard Oil, Chase Bank, and US Steel through "Sullivan & Cromwell," and the Morgan and Rockefeller groups. Moreover, Cromwell himself was an important figure in the Morgan Group, and he single-handedly created the Panama "Revolution," allowing the United States to seize the Panama Canal Zone. Under his tutelage, Dulles learned the skills of an imperialist.

　　Dulles's grandfather was the Secretary of State for President Harrison, and his father was a professor of theology. Dulles knew how to use his ancestor's "blessings." Due to his grandfather's relationship, Dulles participated in the Second Hague Peace Conference in 1907 as the secretary of the Chinese delegation. After the First World War, he served as an advisor to Wilson at the Versailles Peace Conference. At this time, he met the banker Baruch. He also participated in the Allied Supreme Economic Council with Hoover (later the President) and represented the United States in the Allied Reparations Committee. He had a close personal relationship with Hoover, and his relationship with Hoover became closer in the drafting of Germany's reparations plan. To this day, he, Hoover, and Vandenberg are still brothers in arms in the American reactionary faction. Dulles also participated in drafting the Dawes Plan. He represented the American banking community at the meeting on German debt issues, which was convened by Schacht, the president of the German bank, and he met Schacht. During World War II, Schacht was an important war criminal, but he was spared execution at the Nuremberg trials, supposedly due to Dulles's rescue!

　　Due to his father's relationship, Dulles also occupied an important position in the American church. He is the chairman of the reactionary "Universal Church." One of the tenets of this church is to advocate that the Anglo-Saxon race and the Vatican should unite to "confront the Soviet Union." Dulles directs the American church's foreign relations and presides over international church conferences. He uses religious activities to cooperate with his reactionary political activities.

　　From Dulles's background, relationships, and early political activities, we can understand that Dulles's relationship with the American big bourgeoisie is very close. He has now become a director of the Rockefeller Foundation and a director of the New York Bank, the American Banknote Company, the International Nickel Company, etc. For the economic interests of this class, he has used his skills to carry out a series of anti-Soviet, anti-communist, and anti-democratic reactionary political activities.

　　Dulles has consistently supported fascism--

　　American monopoly capitalists have long supported reactionary regimes in various countries. In 1927, Dulles and a group of Morgan and Rockefeller experts went to Warsaw, where he served as an advisor to the Piłsudski government, assisting the Polish fascist regime in formulating a plan to stabilize finances. This relationship continued until later, during the Second World War, when Dulles and his law firm were still responsible for handling the financial affairs of the Polish and Belgian governments-in-exile in London and protecting their rights.

　　Between the two World Wars, Dulles devoted himself to helping the resurgence of Nazi Germany. He promoted the establishment of various cartel agreements between major enterprises such as DuPont Chemical Trust and US Steel and German monopoly capital. At that time, American and German transactions were conducted through the Schröder Bank, Hitler Germany's agent in the United States, and Dulles's brother Allen Dulles was a director of the bank. US Senator Pepper criticized Dulles in October 1944 for assisting Hitler's rise to power. He pointed out that "Sullivan & Cromwell" had a close relationship with Schröder Bank, and that Hitler, through Schröder Bank and the West German industrial monopolists it represented, obtained the money he needed to launch a world war later.

　　In 1939, Hitler launched the European war. Dulles sang isolationism in the United States, preventing the United States from joining the war. He publicly gave speeches saying that "there is no reason to believe that any totalitarian country (whether alone or collectively) intends to attack the United States. Only those who are nervous will say that Germany, Italy, and Japan intend to fight us." He also strongly opposed American aid to countries fighting Germany.

　　During the war, the Dulles brothers carried out activities to undermine the anti-fascist war. Allen was an American intelligence officer stationed in Switzerland, where he maintained contact between American financial groups and German monopoly capital. At that time, peace negotiations with Schacht and other Hitler representatives were conducted through him without the knowledge of other Allied countries. Dulles himself supported pro-German fascist organizations such as the "America First Committee" in the United States. He also sheltered some Nazis. Westerlek, the representative sent by Hitler to the United States during the war to negotiate with Wall Street, was Dulles's colleague and his firm's representative in Germany. Dulles's relationship with Germany can be seen from this.

　　Dulles has consistently been anti-Soviet and anti-people--

　　As early as 1919, during the years of severe famine following the Soviet revolution, Dulles advocated a food blockade policy, vainly attempting to strangle the then newly born socialist Soviet state.

　　After the Second World War, Dulles's anti-Soviet activities reached a frantic level. He strongly advocated a tough policy towards the Soviet Union and asserted that if the United States abandoned this policy and hoped to reach any agreement with the Soviet Union, war would be inevitable. He said: "American policy must have significant extensions to challenge the Soviet Union." He participated in many post-war international conferences, using his position as an advisor to influence American policy and undermine post-war international cooperation. He drafted the aggressive speeches for Marshall in the foreign ministers' meetings.

　　Dulles actively undermined the United Nations. At the United Nations General Assembly on November 7, 1946, he said: "If the UN Security Council does not accept Truman's proposal to place the Pacific islands previously mandated by Japan under the exclusive trusteeship of the United States, then the United States can only occupy these islands." At a press conference on September 19, 1947, he launched a massive attack on the Security Council and the veto. He advocated abolishing the Security Council and replacing it with a resident committee to undermine the principle of unanimous agreement among the great powers. On November 6, 1947, he openly declared at the UN General Assembly: "The United States does not want to overemphasize the Yalta and Potsdam agreements..."

　　Dulles insisted on the policy of splitting Germany, causing the foreign ministers' meeting in London to discuss the German peace treaty to fail and be postponed indefinitely. According to Time magazine at the time: "In the days before Marshall took office as Secretary of State, the United States had already formulated a specific policy towards Germany, and Dulles was the one who formulated this policy."

　　Dulles's anti-people's despicable and shameless activities are not limited to this. When French workers launched a nationwide strike in December 1947 to oppose all reactionary measures in France, causing the Schuman cabinet crisis, Dulles personally rushed to Paris to support Schuman in taking all measures to suppress the strike. Moreover, in 1948, Dulles also instigated a so-called "Bridge Project," conspiring to carry out various espionage and sabotage activities, supporting all kinds of anti-communist elements, "assassinating communist leaders," etc. From these facts, we can clearly see Dulles's ferocious face.

　　Last year, Dewey lost the election, and Dulles did not become Secretary of State. But his position as a senator and Republican leader still gives him great influence on American foreign policy decisions. Dulles's name is inseparable from war. He is now desperately clamoring for the United States to expand its military bases, joint defense, military "aid" to Europe, and continued aid to Chiang Kai-shek... exposing his true face as a warmonger. The powerful strength of the world's peace and democracy camp, led by the Soviet Union, will cause these war-mongering people to fail shamefully!

　　美国战争贩子杜勒斯
    近来积极支持北大西洋公约联防计划和叫嚣着继续援蒋的美国反动分子中便有杜勒斯其人。大家都知道，杜勒斯在一九四七年的联合国大会中被维辛斯基直斥为战争贩子。他和范登堡同为共和党外交政策的决策者，他与民主党控制的国务院有密切关系。杜勒斯是今日美国反动阵营中的一个重要角色。
    杜勒斯（Ｊｏｈｎ　Ｆｏｓｔｅｒ　Ｄｕｌｌｅｓ）生于一八八八年。他离开大学之后，便在华尔街最大律师事务所之一的“苏利文·克伦威尔律师事务所”当律师。杜勒斯一开始便钻进这与美国大财阀有密切关系的律师事务所，这与他一生的反动事业有很大的关系。我们知道，律师在美国资产阶级统治的政治生活中有着重要的地位。美国的金融寡头利用律师代他们掌握政府，美国的国会总有一半到三分之二的议员是律师，而美国历来的总统亦几乎都是律师出身的。杜勒斯的保守、矫诈、虚伪、反动、唯利是图等等的习性使他的主子们选择了他去当他们的代言人。杜勒斯通过了“苏利文·克伦威尔事务所”与摩根、洛克菲勒的大公司如美孚石油公司、大通银行、美国钢铁公司等建立了密切的关系。而且，克伦威尔本人便是摩根集团中的重要人物，他还一手制造了巴拿马的“革命”，使美帝取得了巴拿马运河区。在他的教养之下，杜勒斯学会了一身帝国主义者的看家本领。
    杜勒斯的祖父是哈里逊总统的国务卿，他的父亲是一个神学教授。杜勒斯懂得怎样去利用祖宗的“福荫”。由于他祖父的关系，杜勒斯在一九○七年参加了第二届海牙和平会议，担任中国代表团的秘书。第一次大战之后，他当了凡尔赛和会中威尔逊的顾问，在这时，他结识了银行家巴鲁区。他又和胡佛（后来的总统）一同参加了同盟国最高经济委员会，并代表美国参加同盟国赔偿委员会。他和胡佛的私交甚笃，后来在拟订德国的赔偿计划中，他与胡佛的关系更加密切。时至今日，他与胡佛和范登堡三人，还是美国反动派中的难兄难弟。杜勒斯又参加了起草道威斯计划。他代表美国银行界出席德国债务问题的会议，会议是德国银行的总裁沙赫特召集的，他乃结识了沙赫特。第二次世界大战时，沙赫特是一个重要战犯，但他之所以在纽伦堡审讯中免于处死，据说是由于杜勒斯的拯救！
    由于他父亲的关系，杜勒斯在美国教会中也占了重要的地位，他是反动的“环球教会”的主席。这个教会的教条之一是，主张盎格鲁撒克逊族与梵蒂岗联合起来，“对抗苏联”。杜勒斯指导美国教会对外关系，主持国际教会会议。他利用了宗教方面的活动去配合他反动的政治活动。
    从杜勒斯的背景、关系和早期的政治活动看来，我们可以了解杜勒斯与美国大资产阶级的关系是非常密切的，他现在已当起了洛克菲勒基金会的董事，和纽约银行、美国钞票公司、国际镍公司等的董事，为了这个阶级的经济利益，他便施展了他的技俩，进行了一系列的反苏、反共、反民主的反动的政治活动。
    杜勒斯是一贯支持法西斯的——
    美国的垄断资本家自早便支持各国反动政权。一九二七年杜勒斯与一班摩根和洛克菲勒的专家们去华沙，他担任了毕苏斯基政府的顾问，协助波兰的法西斯政权拟订稳定金融的计划。这种关系一直继续到后来在第二次大战的时候，杜勒斯和他的律师事务所还是负责为波兰和比利时在伦敦的流亡政府处理财政事务，并且保护它们的权益。
    在两次大战之间，杜勒斯致力帮助纳粹德国的再起。他促成杜邦化学托辣斯和美国钢铁公司等大企业与德国垄断资本订立各种卡迭尔协定。当时美国与德国的交易是通过希特勒德国在美国的代理歇洛德银行进行的，杜勒斯的兄弟阿兰·杜勒斯便是该行的董事。美国参议员裴柏曾在一九四四年十月斥责杜勒斯协助希特勒当权，他指出“苏利文·克伦威尔事务所”与歇洛德银行有密切关系，而希特勒通过了歇洛德银行及其所代表的西德工业垄断者，才获得了后来他发动世界大战所需的金钱。
    一九三九年希特勒发动了欧洲战争，杜勒斯在美国高唱孤立主义，阻止美国参战，他公开发表演讲，说“没有什么理由可以相信有任何极权主义的国家（不论是单独的或集体的）企图攻击美国，只有那些神经质的人才会说德国、意大利、日本企图对我们作战。”他还极力反对美国援助与德国作战的国家。
    在战争期间，杜勒斯两兄弟进行破坏反法西斯战争的工作。阿兰是美国驻瑞士的情报人员，在那里他保持了美国财阀与德国垄断资本的联系，当时与沙赫特和其他希特勒代表进行和平谈判是通过他而瞒着其他盟国进行的。杜勒斯自己却在美国支持如“美国至上委员会”一类的亲德法西斯组织。他还庇护一些纳粹分子。战时希特勒派去美国与华尔街谈判的代表威士特列克，便是杜勒斯的同事和他的事务所的驻德代表。杜勒斯与德国之间的关系，于此可见。
    杜勒斯是一贯反苏、反人民的——
    远在一九一九年，正当苏联革命后发生严重粮荒的年月，杜勒斯便主张粮食封锁政策，妄想扼杀当时刚诞生的社会主义苏维埃国家。
    第二次大战之后，杜勒斯的反苏活动达到了疯狂的程度。他极力主张对苏强硬的政策，并断言如果美国放弃这种方针而指望与苏联达成任何协议，则战争是必然不可避免的。他这样说：“美国的政策必须有重要的伸展来与苏联挑战。”他参加许多战后的国际会议，利用他顾问的地位影响美国政策，破坏战后国际合作。他为马歇尔草拟在外长会议中的侵略性的演讲词。
    杜勒斯积极破坏联合国，在一九四六年十一月七日的联合国大会上，他说：“假若联大安理会不接受杜鲁门建议，把过去由日本委任统治的太平洋岛屿悉归美国单独托管，则美国只有占领这些岛屿。”在一九四七年九月十九日记者会议上，他对安理会及否决权大肆攻击。他主张取消安理会，代之以驻会委员会，以破坏大国协议一致的原则。一九四七年十一月六日他竟在联大会议上公开宣称：“美国不欲过份尊重雅尔塔、波茨顿协定。……”
    杜勒斯坚持分裂德国的政策，致使外长会议在伦敦开会讨论对德和约失败后曾一度无限期延期开会。据当时时代周刊报导：“当马歇尔就任国务卿的前几天，美国已拟定了一个对德的具体政策，制订这个政策的正是杜勒斯。”
    杜勒斯反人民的卑鄙无耻的活动尚不止此，当一九四七年十二月，法国工人们为反对法国国内一切反动措施举行全国性大罢工而引起舒曼内阁危机时，杜勒斯曾亲自赶到巴黎，支持舒曼采取一切方法镇压罢工。甚者，一九四八年时，杜勒斯还策动了一个所谓“布里奇计划”，阴谋进行各种间谍工作和破坏活动，支持各种各样的反共分子，“谋刺共产党领袖”等。从这些事实中，我们可以清楚地看到杜勒斯的狰狞面孔。
    去年杜威竞选失败，杜勒斯做不成国务卿。但是他的参议员和共和党领袖的地位，仍使他对美国外交决策有着很大的影响。杜勒斯的名字是和战争离不开的，他正在力竭声嘶地叫嚣着美国扩张军事基地，联防，军事“援”欧，继续援蒋……暴露他底战争贩子底真面目。全世界以苏联为首的和平民主阵营的强大力量将使这些贩卖战争的人们可耻地失败！
