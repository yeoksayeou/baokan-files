　　The World Labor Congress Delegation Returns Home
  　The CCP Beiping Municipal Committee Holds Welcome Meeting
    Lin Qiangyun and Others Speak Enthusiastically About the Soviet Union's Internationalist Spirit in Helping New Democratic Countries Build
    [Beiping News] After the return of the Chinese delegation attending the Second World Trade Union Congress, the Beiping Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China held a welcome meeting at 10:00 am on the 26th. More than 300 cadres from the Municipal Committee of the CCP, the Municipal Government, the Military Control Commission, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and various factories and mines attended. At the meeting, Lin Qiangyun, deputy head of the delegation, and Jin Zhifu reported on their experiences in attending the conference and their impressions abroad.

    Lin Qiangyun first explained that the World Federation of Trade Unions is a strong fortress for the close unity of the working class and the defense of world peace. He then described the infinite love and respect of workers from various countries for Chairman Mao, the leader of the Chinese people, and the Chinese working brothers. He also reported on the post-war recovery and construction of the new democratic countries in Eastern Europe, pointing out that their rapid construction was the result of the Soviet Union's great internationalist spirit, which provided them with material and technical assistance. For example, in Hungary, within three years after the war, with the help of the Soviet Union, not only was the pre-war production level restored, but it also exceeded it by 36 percent. Finally, he introduced the thriving prosperity and construction of the great socialist country of the Soviet Union, as well as the unparalleled importance that every Soviet person attaches to production at all times, emphasizing that they are always "oriented towards production." He called on us to learn from the Soviet Union honestly.

    In his speech, Jin Zhifu reported on his own impressions of this trip abroad. He said that the Soviet people's internationalist spirit, which transcends all national boundaries, and their sincere and earnest friendship in helping the construction work of various new democratic countries, deeply moved each of our representatives. At the same time, after seeing the Soviet Union's efforts to assist various new democratic countries during this trip abroad, we have gained unlimited confidence, believing that our construction work, with the assistance of the Soviet Union and the people of various new democratic countries, will definitely be able to accelerate the speed of recovery and development.

    Finally, Comrade Peng Zhen, in addition to expressing his condolences to the delegation, encouraged every cadre and worker to have a deep understanding of internationalism; they should also understand that the revival and construction of China must learn from the Soviet Union and rely on the help of the Soviet Union and new democratic countries. Finally, he called on the administrative departments, trade unions, and Party branches of various factories and mines to learn from the working spirit of Soviet comrades and their emphasis on production and construction tasks.

    金质夫在讲话中报告了他自己此次出国的感想，他说苏联人民毫无民族界限的国际主义精神及诚恳殷切地帮助各新民主主义国家建设工作的伟大友谊，使我们每个代表都极感动，同时，在我们此次出国中看到苏联对各新民主主义国家尽力援助的情形之后，使我们增加了无限的信心，相信我们的建设工作在苏联及各新民主主义国家人民的援助下，一定能加快恢复与发展的速度。
    最后，彭真同志除对代表团表示慰劳之外，并勉励每一个干部及工人应对国际主义有深刻的认识；更应该了解中国的复兴与建设，必须向苏联学习，必须依靠苏联与新民主主义国家的帮助。最后并号召各厂矿的行政、工会及党的支部，都应当学习苏联同志的工作精神，以及对生产建设任务的重视。
