Military Diary
    Jia Huai
    On April 23rd, we crossed the river with the troops and rested in Dingjiahu, Dongliu County (on Peach Blossom Mountain on the south bank of the Yangtze River). Besides the quilts, clothes, hats, ammunition, weapons, and piles of bloodstains left by the enemy, the streets were filled with drifting chicken feathers and cow hair, and not a single person could be seen. The situation in the villagers' courtyards was even more miserable: broken doors, broken windows, messy grass, torn clothes, and broken pots and bowls were scattered everywhere... Some villagers were beginning to return to tidy up. A boss named Hu Xinmao talked to me. From his words and the documents abandoned by the enemy, I learned that this was originally a so-called Yangtze River defense line fortress of the enemy—the regimental headquarters of the 423rd Regiment of the 141st Division of Jiang’s 96th Army. During the conversation, he angrily said to me: "A few days ago, some bandit troops came from Anqing, and they only stayed for less than three days, but look, what have they turned the village into? They robbed and damaged my things, and even killed the cow that my nephew and I were feeding. Comrade, cows are the lifeblood of farmers..." He wiped his tears and continued: "I personally watched them kill it that day, and my heart felt even more painful than being cut with a knife!" Then he sighed deeply, as if comforting himself, and said: "Oh, at that time, even one's own life could not be guaranteed, how could one protect the cow! Just take those few girls in my family who are under twenty years old, they were ravaged like that, and they are still unconscious."
    "The day before yesterday afternoon (April 21st), the sound of your artillery was louder than thunder, and dense artillery shells flew over the roof of my house. This scared them. At that time, their regimental headquarters was distributing new clothes, and the person in charge ran south with his legs. When the soldiers saw this, they threw off their hats, took off their clothes, and threw away their rifles, grenades, and ammunition bags, and followed suit. Some who were sleeping in the houses didn't even have time to put on their shoes, and ran out holding up their trousers. At this time, I felt relieved in my heart, thinking that these wicked bandits would have this day!"

　　行军杂记
    贾怀
    四月二十三日，我们随着部队过了江，在东流县丁家胡（在长江南岸的桃花山上）休息。街上除了敌人丢下的被子、衣服、帽子、弹药武器和一堆堆的血迹外，就是顺风移动的鸡毛牛毛，见不到一个人影。在老乡的院子里，情况更是凄惨：四处横躺着破门、烂窗、乱草、破衣服、打碎的锅碗……有的老乡正在开始回来整理。一个叫胡新茂的老板和我谈起话来。从他的口里和敌人丢下的公文中，使我知道这里原来也是一个敌人所谓长江防线的堡垒——蒋匪九十六军一四一师四二三团团部。在谈话时，他气愤的对我说：“前几天由安庆开来些土匪队伍，住了没到三天，你看，便把村中弄成个什么样子了？他们抢走和损坏了我的东西，甚至把我和俺侄子喂的那条牛也杀掉了。同志，牛是庄稼人的命根子呀……”他擦了一擦眼泪，继续说：“那天我还亲眼看着他们杀的呀，心中简直比给人用刀子剜我的心肝还难受！”接着他长长地叹了口气，好象是安慰自己似的，说：“咳，那时连自己的性命还不能保险，那里能保牛！就说我本家那几个不满二十岁的姑娘吧，被他们糟蹋成那个样子，现在还不省人事呢。
    “前天下午（四月二十一日），你们的炮声响得简直比雷还要震耳，密密的炮弹由我的房顶上飞过。这一下可把他们搞荒了。当时，他们的团部正在发新衣服，那负责人拔起腿来就向南跑。当兵的一看如此，把帽子一抛，衣服一脱，步枪手榴弹和子弹袋一丢，也跟着跑了。一些正在房子里睡觉的，有的连鞋也来不及穿了，用手提住裤叉便跑了出去。这时，我心中才算松了口气，心想这些无恶不做的匪徒们也有今日！”
