Announcement of the Beiping Municipal People's Government Bureau of Industry and Commerce
    Industry and Commerce Letter No. 4

    I. In accordance with the instructions of the North China People's Government Ministry of Industry and Commerce regarding the "Provisional Measures for Industrial and Commercial Enterprises in the North China Region to Apply for Business Registration" and the regulations of the North China Financial and Economic Committee: State-owned and public-owned factories, stores, and factories and workshops established by government agencies for production should all apply to the local government's Bureau of Industry and Commerce for registration and obtain a business license. However, some have not yet completed the registration procedures. It is hereby announced that from the date of this announcement, all state-owned and public-owned factories and stores established in this city, as well as factories and workshops established for production by government agencies at all levels in Beiping, must come to the Bureau to complete registration within fifteen days.

    II. The Military Control Commission decided: "All public-owned enterprises or trade units coming to Beiping to purchase materials, or administrative agencies stationed in Beiping, as well as production departments of various levels of government agencies in Beiping, who need to purchase materials in the city's market, whether they have already purchased them or are preparing to purchase them, must register with the Beiping Municipal People's Government Bureau of Industry and Commerce within one week from August 7, 1949, accurately report the types, quantities, and uses of the purchased materials, and make contact with the Beiping Municipal Trade Company. Those who violate this will be dealt with according to law." This has already been announced to the public. Now that it has been overdue for many days, there are still some who have not come to the Bureau to register in accordance with the above regulations, which is obviously inappropriate. It is hereby announced again to the above-mentioned units that they must come to the Bureau for registration as soon as possible in accordance with the regulations. This is hereby announced.

    一、依照华北人民政府工商部关于华北区工商业声请营业登记暂行办法的指示及华北财经委员会之规定：国营公营工厂商店及机关生产之工厂作坊，均应向所在地政府工商局声请登记领取营业证，惟迄今尚有一部未经办理登记手续，兹定自通告之日起，所有在本市设立之国营公营工厂商店及在平各级机关生产设立之工厂作坊，统限于十五日内来局办理登记。
    二、军管会决定：“凡各地区来平采购物资之公营企业或贸易单位或驻平之行政机构以及在平之各级机关生产部门，需在本市市场采购物资者，无论已否购妥或正准备采购，统限于三十八年八月七日起，一周内向北平市人民政府工商局进行登记，确实报告采购之品种数量及用途，并与北平市贸易公司取得连系，违者将依法处理。”业已布告周知在案，现已逾期多日，尚有未按上项规定来局进行登记者，显属不合。兹特再通告上开各单位，务须依照规定，克日来局登记。特此通告
