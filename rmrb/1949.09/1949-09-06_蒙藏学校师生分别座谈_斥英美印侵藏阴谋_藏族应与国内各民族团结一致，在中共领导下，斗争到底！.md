　　Mongolian and Tibetan School Teachers and Students Hold Separate Forums
　　Denounce the Anglo-American-Indian Plot to Invade Tibet
　　Tibetan People Should Unite with All Nationalities in the Country and Struggle to the End Under the Leadership of the Chinese Communist Party!
　　[Our Newspaper] The news that Anglo-American-Indian aggressors were creating conspiracies and attempting to annex our Tibetan territory aroused indignation among all teachers, staff, and students of the Mongolian and Tibetan School. On the 4th and 5th, they held separate forums to express their opinions and views on the tricks of the imperialists. Principal Huang Jingtao summarized the opinions of everyone at the general faculty meeting on the 5th as follows:
　　The British imperialists' conspiracy against Tibet is just like the American imperialists' conspiracy against Taiwan. Tibet is our motherland's territory, and we will never allow imperialists to invade it. Today, when the Chinese people are about to be completely liberated, the imperialists' attempt to conspire to annex our territory fully demonstrates their shamelessness and recklessness. We hope that Tibet and all of our country's territories will be liberated as soon as possible, giving the Anglo-American imperialists' invasion plot a thorough blow and driving all imperialists and their running dogs out of China's borders. The Chinese Communist Party advocates national equality, minority nationality autonomy, and respect for the religious beliefs, cultures, and customs of all nationalities. Our Tibetan nationality should consciously unite to crush the conspiracies carried out by Anglo-American-Indian aggressors in collusion with Tibetan reactionaries. We must unite with the people of all nationalities in the country and, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, fight to the end for the liberation of the motherland. We firmly believe that the Chinese People's Liberation Army will fight to the end for the democratic freedom of all nationalities in the country. This move by the Chinese People's Liberation Army will surely win the sincere support of Tibet and all minority nationalities.
　　The Student Union held a forum at 5:00 PM on the 4th. During the discussion, Mongolian and Tibetan youth unanimously issued the call to "Oppose the foreign aggressors' conspiracy to annex China's territory - Tibet." Comrade Li Suqing said: "The imperialists' conspiracy is to attempt to prevent the liberation of our Tibetan nationality and annex Tibet as their territory." Wu Xixian said: "We see very clearly that the British imperialists' trick is to separate Tibet from the motherland in order to carry out their policy of aggression." Qi E'ge, a Mongolian student, excitedly described the liberation of the Mongolian nationality, saying: "The cause of the liberation of us minority nationalities can only be completed quickly and thoroughly under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party; the liberation of Inner Mongolia is an example." Comrades Ji Mude and Li Sulan said: "Tibetan reactionaries collude with imperialists to sell out the territory of the motherland and the interests of the nationality. We must resolutely oppose this." Finally, A Ri Gun Su Ri Tu, chairman of the Student Union, summarized this discussion: "No corner of China will ever be allowed to become a colony of imperialism. The people of all nationalities in China are sons and daughters of the motherland, our brothers and sisters, and we must never allow them to become slaves of the invaders. Standing on the position of the Chinese people and the friendship of all minority nationalities, we warn all imperialists who dare to invade our Tibet that as long as they infringe upon our Chinese territorial sovereignty and endanger the interests of our people, the Chinese people will resolutely fight them to the end until they are eliminated. We Mongolian and Tibetan youth have added another debt to the imperialists in our hearts. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, we will soon liberate the great southwest, liberate every inch of territory in China, and settle accounts with the imperialist aggressors."

　　蒙藏学校师生分别座谈
  　斥英美印侵藏阴谋
    藏族应与国内各民族团结一致，在中共领导下，斗争到底！
    【本报讯】英美印侵略者制造阴谋事变，妄图吞并我西藏领土的消息传到蒙藏学校以后，引起了全校教职员与学生的愤慨。四、五两日，他们分别召开了座谈会，对帝国主义者的鬼把戏发表了意见和看法。校长黄敬涛综述五日全体教职员讨论会中大家的意见如下：
    英帝国主义对西藏的阴谋正和美帝对台湾的阴谋一样。西藏是我们祖国的领土，决不容许帝国主义者侵略。当中国人民即将完全解放的今天，帝国主义者妄图阴谋吞并我国领土的举动，充分证明了它们的无耻和冒险。我们希望西藏及所有我国的领土早日获得解放，给英美帝国主义的侵略阴谋以彻底的打击，将一切帝国主义及其走狗的恶势力，逐出中国的境界。中国共产党是主张民族平等，少数民族自治，尊重各民族的宗教信仰、文化、习惯的。我们西藏民族应该自觉地团结起来，粉碎英美印侵略者及西藏反动分子勾结着进行的阴谋活动。我们必须与国内各民族人民团结一致，在中国共产党的领导下，为祖国的解放斗争到底。我们坚信中国人民解放军必将为国内各民族的民主自由而战斗到底。中国人民解放军的这一举动必将获得西藏及各少数民族的竭诚拥护与支持。
    学生会于四日下午五时召开了座谈会，讨论中，蒙藏青年一致发出了“反对外国侵略者阴谋吞并中国的领土——西藏”的呼声。李素清同学说：“帝国主义者的阴谋是妄图阻止我们西藏民族的解放，把西藏吞并为他们的领土”。乌希贤说：“我们看的非常清楚，英帝的诡计是使西藏与祖国分离而进行他的侵略政策”。齐额格是蒙古籍的同学，他兴奋地叙述着蒙古民族的解放，他说：“我们少数民族的人民解放事业只有在中国共产党的领导下，才能迅速、彻底的完成，内蒙古的解放便是一个例子。”纪木德和李素兰同学说：“西藏反动分子和帝国主义者勾结，出卖祖国版图和民族利益。我们必须坚决反对。”最后学生会主席阿日棍苏日图总结了这一次的讨论：“中国的任何一个角落，绝不容许变成帝国主义的殖民地。中国各民族的人民都是祖国的儿女，是我们的兄弟姐妹，绝不能使他们变成侵略者的奴隶。我们站在中国人民的立场上，各少数民族的友谊上，警告所有胆敢侵略我西藏的帝国主义者，只要他侵犯我们中国的领土主权，危害我人民的利益，中国人民将和他坚决斗争到底，直到把他们消灭。我们蒙藏青年在心上把帝国主义者又记上一笔仇帐，在中国共产党的领导下不久即将解放大西南、解放所有中国的每一寸领土、和帝国主义侵略者清算。”
