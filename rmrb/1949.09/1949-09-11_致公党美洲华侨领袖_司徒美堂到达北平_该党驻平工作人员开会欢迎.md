Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 10th: Situ Meitang, the leader of the Zhi Gong Party's overseas Chinese affairs in the Americas, arrived in Beiping on the 4th of this month. The staff of the China Zhi Gong Party stationed in Beiping held a meeting on the 8th to welcome him.

At the meeting, Chairman Chen Qiyou delivered a welcome speech first. He briefly stated that Comrade Situ's spirit of fighting for the Chinese revolution and working hard for the Party is worthy of emulation by all Party comrades. In the future, there are many things the Party needs Comrade Situ to work hard on.

Then, Situ Meitang delivered a reply, saying:

	"After a month's journey, Meitang has arrived in Beiping. Seeing that a new China is about to emerge, and being able to gather with all comrades, I feel excited and honored.
	"Overseas Chinese in the Americas, being in a foreign land, often suffer from bullying by foreign races. As early as two hundred and some years ago, there was an organization called the Zhi Gong Tang, which was later changed to the Zhi Gong Party. Many overseas Chinese in various ports participated. Meitang himself has been working for the Tang affairs and Party affairs, following the advanced elements of the domestic revolution and responding to the revolutionary movement for more than sixty years. Overseas compatriots eagerly look forward to an independent, free, democratic, and unified new China to relieve the pain accumulated in their hearts. This expectation has now been achieved. The heavy shackles of imperialism, bureaucratic capital, and feudal forces have now been broken. How to mobilize overseas Chinese, raise capital, and return to the country to participate in production and construction is a difficult task that falls on our shoulders.
	"Although the Zhi Gong Party has a long history, its past work has not kept up with the needs of the times and has been very lax. In the past few years, thanks to the hard work of comrades in the country, the Party's affairs have developed and its prestige has been enhanced, which is gratifying. Now that everyone is gathered in Beiping to discuss the great plan of nation-building with various democratic parties, it is hoped that comrades at home and abroad will work together under the leadership of Chairman Mao of the Chinese Communist Party to participate in the great cause of building the People's Republic."

　　致公党美洲华侨领袖
　  司徒美堂到达北平
　  该党驻平工作人员开会欢迎
    【新华社北平十日电】致公党美洲华侨领袖司徒美堂于本月四日到达北平后，中国致公党驻平工作人员曾于八日开会欢迎。
    会上首由主席陈其尤致欢迎词。略称司徒同志为中国革命而奋斗、为本党工作而努力的精神足为本党同志效法。今后本党有待于司徒同志努力者甚多。
    继由司徒美堂致答词称：
    “美堂此次经一个月的旅途，来到北平，眼见新中国马上要出现，又得与各位同志聚首一堂，实感兴奋与荣幸。
    “美洲华侨，以身处异地，常受外族欺凌，早在二百数十年前，即有致公堂的组织，后来才改为致公党，各埠侨胞参加的为数颇多。美堂本人为堂务与党务奔走，追随国内革命先进之后，响应革命运动，亦达六十余年。海外同胞热烈期望一个独立自由民主统一的新中国，以伸心头积痛，这期望现在达到了。帝国主义，官僚资本，封建势力的重重枷锁现在打破了。如何去动员侨胞，筹集资本，回国参加生产建设，这个艰巨的任务，落在我们的身上。
    “致公党虽有悠久历史，但过去工作还赶不上时代需要，很是散漫。这几年来由于国内同志的努力奋斗，党务是发展了，威信是提高了，这是值得欢喜的。现在大家齐集北平，与各民主党派共商建国大计，希望海内外同志在中共毛主席领导下，共同努力，参加建设人民共和国的伟大事业。”
