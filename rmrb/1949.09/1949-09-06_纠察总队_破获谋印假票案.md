　　Smashes Counterfeit Currency Plot

　　[This newspaper] The Public Security Corps recently uncovered a case involving the attempted printing of counterfeit People's Banknotes. The ringleader, Wu Wenhai, colluded with Du Yingshun to plan the printing of two reams of counterfeit People's Banknotes. Wu Wenhai, Du Yingshun, and others contacted Zheng Qiyuan, Zhou Zhenye, Gao Hengyong, and Tang Jianzhong (who is at large) to raise a total of 5.6 million People's Banknotes. They printed the currency at Wu Wenhai's home, purchased a paper cutter, and rented a lithographic printing machine. They prepared for two months, moving the machinery to the home of Wu Wenfu (Wu Wenhai's brother) at No. 1 Shouping Hutong. The copperplate for the 100-yuan counterfeit People's Banknote was also completed, and they were preparing to start printing when we completely smashed the operation. Wu Wenhai is the Director of the Reading Room at the Beiping Municipal Library and is a retained employee of our government. Not only did he fail to implement the decrees of the People's Government, but he dared to recruit others to print counterfeit People's Banknotes and disrupt the financial system. After being arrested by our Public Security Corps on August 3rd, the Education Bureau of the People's Municipal Government decided to remove him from his post. The entire case has been handed over to the People's Court for processing. (Guang)
