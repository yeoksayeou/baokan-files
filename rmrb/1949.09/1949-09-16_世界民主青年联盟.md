　　World Federation of Democratic Youth
    Liang Ming
    The World Federation of Democratic Youth—this organization, symbolizing the strength and will of democratic youth worldwide, was established in London on November 10, 1945. It shoulders the immense task of uniting all progressive youth in the world, striving for lasting peace and people's democracy, and defending the vital interests of millions of democratic youth in capitalist countries, colonies, and dependencies.
    The international solidarity of youth began to be established as early as 1907. The Youth International Bureau, led by Liebknecht, convened the first International Youth Representatives Conference in 1907. In 1914, the "Socialist International League" met in Bern, Switzerland, and decided that the first week of September should be World Youth Week to strengthen the international solidarity of youth. Since its inception, the World Federation of Democratic Youth has greatly developed the fine traditions in the history of this international youth movement and has become a strong mainstay in the world peace camp.
    In the spring of 1946, the WFDY headquarters was established in Paris.
    The Second Executive Committee meeting, held in Prague from August 21 to 30, 1947, resolved to support the struggles of China, Indonesia, Vietnam, Greece, and other countries against fascism and imperialism. In particular, the resolution on China severely condemned the oppression and massacre of Chinese youth by the American-Chiang reactionaries, and called on youth around the world to strengthen their opposition to war instigators and fascist remnants who undermine the independent democratic youth movements in various colonies and dependencies. The meeting's work report pointed out that the world's youth had united 57 countries with 48 million members, an increase of 18 million compared to the 30 million when it was first established.
    On July 20, 1947, the First International Youth Festival was held in Prague, attended by over 17,000 young men and women representatives from 71 countries (including a delegation from the Chinese Liberated Areas) and tens of thousands of Czech youth. The conference unanimously supported strengthening the friendship and unity of youth brothers, resolutely striving for peace, exposing warmongers, and struggling to win democracy and peace for the world. The conference successfully concluded on August 17.
    On February 20, 1948, the Southeast Asian Democratic Youth Representatives Conference, jointly convened by the Second Executive Committee and the World Student Union, was held in Calcutta. This meeting strengthened and expanded the national democratic movement of youth in Southeast Asia and united and consolidated the strength of the anti-imperialist united front of the Eastern people.
    On February 18, 1948, a regular meeting of the Executive Committee was held in Rome. It was resolved to convene an International Labor Youth Conference to absorb peasant youth from colonies and dependencies. The meeting also decided to establish a Central Bureau for Assisting Fighting Youth and an International Assistance Foundation, and announced February 21 as the World Day of Solidarity between Democratic Youth and Youth in Colonies and Dependencies, and April 14 as the World Day of Solidarity between Democratic Youth and Spanish Democratic Youth. The First International Labor Youth Conference was inaugurated in Warsaw on August 8, with 450 delegates from 45 countries in attendance. The conference called on progressive youth from all countries to unite more closely, strive to improve living standards, meet the legitimate demands of young workers, and indicated the tasks of young workers in the struggle carried out by all democratic forces. The conference passed resolutions paying tribute to the youth of China, Free Greece, Republican Spain, Vietnam, and other countries, and fully supporting their struggles for national independence; as well as striving for the economic rights and social and cultural interests of young workers.
    On April 26, 1948, the WFDY also convened the Latin American Democratic Youth Conference in Mexico. The conference discussed the current tasks of Latin American youth and other issues; and made important resolutions, vehemently condemning the expansionist policy of American imperialism, opposing the dictatorial regimes of Chile, Cuba, and other countries; and demanding independence for Puerto Rico.
    On August 22, 1948, a council meeting was held in Otwock, near Warsaw. Alliance Chairman Boyereson and others reported on the work summary of the alliance's activities; and approved the admission of youth organizations from 19 countries into the alliance, thereby increasing the alliance's membership by one million.
    On December 18, 1948, a regular meeting of the Executive Committee was held in Paris. The meeting approved a written report on the work of the Democratic Youth League over the past three years: it was decided to convene a World Youth Conference in Hungary in 1949, and a letter was sent to the United Nations Security Council requesting an end to the Dutch aggression against Indonesia.
    At the Executive Committee meeting held in Budapest on May 28 this year, the achievements of the World Congress for Peace were discussed, as well as Chairman Boyereson's report on the alliance's activities and tasks. Boyereson called on democratic youth around the world to firmly support the resolutions of the Peace Congress and unite the broadest masses in the struggle for peace.
    From August 14 to 28, the World Youth and Student Festival, watched by the democratic public worldwide, was held in Budapest. This conference further strengthened the unity of youth around the world in order to fight for peace, democracy, national independence, and a better future.
    In accordance with the tradition established in 1914, the Second World Youth Representatives Conference was held in Budapest in the first week of September. According to WFDY Chairman Boyereson, WFDY membership has grown to 60 million young men and women in more than 70 countries. Such a large international youth organization will undoubtedly play a huge role in the peace and democratic movement in the future.

　　世界民主青年联盟
    梁明
    世界民主青年联盟——这个标帜着全世界民主青年力量与意志的组织，一九四五年十一月十日建立于伦敦。它肩负着团结世界上一切的进步青年，为争取持久和平与人民民主，保卫在资本主义国家、殖民地与附庸国内千百万民主青年的切身利益而斗争的巨大任务。
    青年的国际团结远在一九○七年，就已开始建立了。李卜克纳西领导的青年国际局，一九○七年召开了第一次国际青年代表会议。一九一四年“社会主义国际同盟”在瑞士伯尔尼开会，为了加强青年的国际团结，决定九月的第一个星期为世界青年周。世界民主青年联盟从诞生以后，大大发展了这个国际青年运动历史中的优良传统，成为世界和平阵营中一支强大的主力军。
    一九四六年春天，世青总部在巴黎成立。
    一九四七年八月二十一日至三十日在布拉格召开的二届执委会，决议支援中国、印尼、越南、希腊等国为反对法西斯主义与帝国主义的斗争。特别是关于中国的决议，严斥美蒋反动派对中国青年的压迫和屠杀，号召全世界青年加强反对战争挑拨者和法西斯余孽破坏各殖民地与附属国的青年独立民主运动。会议的工作报告指出世界青年已团结了五十七国四千八百万的会员，比刚成立时的三千万增加了一千八百万。
    一九四七年七月二十日，七十一国一万七千名以上的青年男女代表（中国解放区派有代表团参加）和数万捷克青年在布拉格举行第一届国际青年节大会。大会一致拥护加强青年兄弟的友谊团结，坚决争取和平，揭穿战争贩子，为使全世界赢得民主和平而奋斗，大会于八月十七日圆满闭幕。
    一九四八年二月二十日，由二届执委会决定与世界学联共同召开的东南亚民主青年代表大会，在加尔各答举行。这一次会议加强和扩大了东南亚青年的民族民主运动，团结和巩固了东方人民反帝统一战线的力量。
    一九四八年二月十八日，执委会例会在罗马举行。决议召开国际劳动青年大会，吸收殖民地与附属国的农民青年参加。会议又决定成立援助战斗青年中央局及国际援助基金会，并宣布二月二十一日为世界民主青年与殖民地和附属国青年团结日，四月十四日为世界民主青年与西班牙民主青年团结日。第一次国际劳动青年大会即于八月八日在华沙揭幕，与会者有四十五个国家的四百五十名代表。大会号召一切国家的进步青年更密切地团结在一起，争取提高生活水准，满足青年工人的合法要求，并指示了在全部民主力量所进行的斗争中青年工人的任务。大会通过向中国、自由希腊、共和西班牙、越南等国青年致敬并全力支持他们为民族独立而进行的斗争；以及争取青年工人经济权利和社会、文化的利益等决议。
    一九四八年四月二十六日，世青又在墨西哥召开拉丁美洲民主青年大会。会议讨论了拉丁美洲青年的当前任务等问题；并作出重要决议，猛烈谴责美帝的扩张政策，反对智利、古巴等国的独裁政权；并要求给予波多黎各以独立。
    一九四八年八月二十二日，在华沙附近奥特伏克城召开理事会。联盟主席鲍埃逊等报告联盟活动的工作总结；批准了十九国青年组织加入联盟，联盟会员因此增加了一百万。
    一九四八年十二月十八日，在巴黎举行执委会例会。会议批准了民主青联过去三年工作的书面报告：决定一九四九年于匈牙利召开世界青年大会，并致函联合国安理会，要求终止荷兰对印尼的侵略。
    今年五月二十八日在布达佩斯召开的执委会，会议曾就世界拥护和平大会的成就，讨论主席鲍埃逊关于联盟活动与任务的报告。鲍埃逊号召全世界民主青年坚决支持和平大会的决议，把最广大的群众团结到争取和平的斗争中去。
    八月十四日至二十八日，在布达佩斯举行全世界民主公众一致注视的世界青年与学生联欢大会。这个大会进一步加强了世界青年的团结，以便为和平、民主、民族独立、和美好的将来而斗争。
    按照一九一四年所创立的传统，第二届世界青年代表大会在九月的第一个星期在布达佩斯举行。据世界青联主席鲍埃逊报告青联会员已发展到七十多个国家的六千万男女青年。如此壮大的国际青年组织，今后无疑地将在和平民主运动中起巨大的作用。
