Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, September 4th: The first phase of construction for the Tianjin China Textile Construction Company has been successfully completed, and production began day and night on the 1st. After the No. 7 Tianjin China Textile Factory was destroyed during the Liberation War, the People's Government, in order to restore and develop production and enable unemployed workers to return to work as soon as possible, decided to utilize the surplus factory site and power of the China Textile Factory to construct a new textile factory with 28,000 spindles and 720 looms. The required machinery and parts were renovated and refurbished from the burnt-out remains of the No. 7 factory and a portion of incomplete machinery originally stored by the company. Another portion of parts were manufactured by the China Textile Machinery Factory. The entire project is planned to be completed in three phases. After construction began in early April, with the active efforts of the workers of the No. 7 China Textile Factory and the Machinery Factory, the various difficulties of matching, repairing, and installing the machinery were overcome. The first phase of the plant construction project was completed at the end of August, with a total of 10,000 spindles and 300 looms installed. The factory buildings have also been fully completed, with a foundation of over 120,000 square feet, entirely elevated three feet with reinforced concrete and covered with flooring. All equipment such as spraying, cooling, heating, fire protection, and waste cotton underground tunnels are located underground or concealed within the walls. All spinning machines are driven by motors, without overhead shafts. All lighting is provided by sun lamps. The roofs of the cleaning rooms are all wrapped with iron sheet fireproof paper, and new-style drinking rooms, washrooms, and toilets are provided. It is the only new type of factory building in Tianjin, which is of great benefit to improving production efficiency and protecting the health of workers. The newly installed 10,000 spindles and 300 looms have now begun to operate, and approximately 2,000 workers from the No. 7 China Textile Factory have obtained employment.
