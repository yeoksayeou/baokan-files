Leading the People Towards the Gate of Prosperity and Showing Oppressed Nations the Road to Liberation
Tianjin Workers Discuss the Significance of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference
[Tianjin, September 22nd, 1:00 PM (This Paper)] The people of Tianjin are enthusiastically supporting the convening of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and eagerly anticipating the success of the conference and the early establishment of the Central People's Government. Workers at the Tianjin Tram Company recently completed the repair of the "People's Political Consultative Conference" locomotive. An Ruiming, a worker at the company, said: "The convening of the People's Political Consultative Conference is like a thunderbolt shaking the world. The people of the whole country and the people of the world who love democracy and peace will be overjoyed, while a few reactionaries will be terrified." Zhao Yang, a worker at Zhongtian Electric Factory, pointed out: "This is the result of the Chinese Communist Party's arduous struggle for twenty-eight years, the great victory of the Chinese working class, and the concrete manifestation of the unprecedented growth of the world's forces for peace and democracy. The victorious convening of the People's Political Consultative Conference not only opened the door for the people to move towards prosperity and well-being, but also pointed out a path for the laboring people in colonial and semi-colonial countries still under imperialist oppression to strive for liberation." Li Huipei, a female worker at Zhongfang No. 6 Factory, and Zhang Douyao, a worker at Tianjin Pulp and Paper Company, both said: "As the working class, the leading class, we must shoulder the glorious task of building a new China, we must study hard, improve our political, cultural, and technical levels, strive for self-reliance, and work hard to produce."
Engineers from the Tianjin Municipal Public Works Bureau immediately held a symposium after hearing the news of the convening of the People's Political Consultative Conference. Everyone unanimously stated that they would celebrate the People's Political Consultative Conference with practical actions, work hard, and complete the plan for building a new Tianjin. Du Shaochi, an engineer at the Automobile Manufacturing and Distribution Factory, said: "To build a new democratic economy, we must first have a national plan, and we must have a national central government to plan and implement it. This central government, which includes all democratic parties and democratic classes across the country, will surely receive the strong support of the people across the country and the enthusiastic support of the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries."
Xiao Caiyu, a professor at Nankai University, said, "This is an unprecedented conference truly belonging to the people in history." He also pointed out: "The birth of a new China is not only a major event for the Chinese people, but also a powerful guarantee for the realization of lasting world peace and democracy." Zhang Huaisan, director of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, pointed out: "Chinese youth will guarantee to overcome all difficulties and participate in and complete the solemn construction of the new China." Liu Yan, chairman of the Tianjin Student Federation, also said: "The new China belongs to the younger generation of China. We young students feel particularly happy and excited about the convening of the People's Political Consultative Conference. In the future, under the leadership of the Central People's Government, we will work hard for the beautiful future of our great motherland."
Industrial and commercial figures also expressed their support for the People's Political Consultative Conference. Zhu Jisheng, general manager of Renli Industrial Company, said: "After the establishment of the Central People's Government, our international status has improved, and we will strengthen our close international friendship with the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries. With the establishment of the Central People's Government, large-scale economic construction can begin, and our industrial sector will be able to strive to develop production under the principle of self-reliance." Bi Mingqi, a representative of the Chamber of Commerce, also pointed out: "In the past, under the oppression and destruction of imperialism and bureaucratic capitalism, Chinese industry and commerce were on the verge of extinction. Only after liberation, under the leadership and support of the People's Government, have they had today's new vitality. The 30,000 merchants in Tianjin are looking forward to the early birth of the People's Republic of China."
Citizens from other walks of life also expressed their opinions, unanimously believing that the convening of the People's Political Consultative Conference is a milestone in the Chinese people's liberation from the shackles of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism and moving towards independence and autonomy. A progressive and beautiful new China is standing before us.

　　率领人民迈进繁荣昌盛之门给被压迫民族指出解放道路         
    天津工人谈中国人民政协意义
    【本报天津二十二日一时电】津市各界人民热烈拥护中国人民政协的召开，并预祝大会成功，热盼中央人民政府早日成立。天津电车公司职工日前即赶修完成了“人民政协”号机车，该公司工人安汝铭说：“人民政协的召开象一声霹雳震撼了全世界，全国人民及世界爱好民主和平的人民一定要欢欣鼓舞，而少数反动派却要闻之丧胆。”中天电机厂工人赵扬指出：“这是中国共产党艰苦奋斗二十八年的成果，是中国工人阶级的伟大胜利，是全世界和平民主力量空前壮大的具体表现。人民政协的胜利召开不仅推开了人民走向富强康乐的大门，而且为仍在帝国主义压迫下的殖民地半殖民地的劳动人民指出了一条争取解放的道路。”中纺六厂女工李慧培、天津纸浆造纸公司工人张斗耀都说：“我们作为领导阶级的工人阶级要担负起建设新中国的光荣任务，必须好好学习，提高政治、文化与技术水平，自强奋斗，努力生产。”
    天津市公务局的工程师在听到人民政协召开消息后，立即举行了座谈会，大家一致表示，决以实际行动庆祝人民政协，努力工作，完成建设新天津的计划。汽车制配厂工程师杜绍篪说：“我们要建设新民主主义的经济，首先要有一个全国性的计划，要有一个全国的中央政府来筹划和执行；而这包括了全国各民主党派、各民主阶层的中央政府，一定会获得全国人民的有力拥护及苏联和各人民民主国家的热烈支持。”
    南开大学教授萧采瑜说：“这是有史以来真正属于人民的空前大会”。他并指出：“新中国的诞生，不仅是中国人民的大事，而且对世界持久和平与民主的实现也将是一个有力的保证。”青年团市筹委主任张淮三指出：“中国青年将保证克服一切困难，参加并完成新中国的庄严建设事业。”津市学联主席刘焱也说：“新的中国是属于中国年青一代的，我们青年学生，对人民政协的召开格外感到欢欣鼓舞，今后我们要在中央人民政府领导下，为伟大祖国的美好将来而努力。”
    工商业家也纷纷表示了他们对人民政协的拥护。仁立实业公司总经理朱继圣说：“中央人民政府成立后，我们的国际地位提高了，我们将更加强与苏联及各人民民主国家的密切的国际友谊。而随着中央人民政府的成立，大规模的经济建设即可开始，我们工业界也就有可能在自力更生的方针下努力发展生产了。”商会代表毕鸣岐也指出：中国工商业过去在帝国主义及官僚资本主义的压迫摧残下已弄得奄奄一息；只有解放后在人民政府领导扶助下才有了今天的新生气象，天津市的三万商户正期待着中华人民共和国的早日诞生。
    其他各界市民也多发表了意见，一致认为人民政协的召开是中国人民已摆脱了帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的束缚，走向独立自主的里程碑，一个进步的美好的新中国已站在我们面前了。
