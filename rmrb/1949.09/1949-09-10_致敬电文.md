Telegram of Respect
    [This newspaper reports] On the anniversary of the school, all faculty, staff, and students of North China University sent a telegram of respect to Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and all commanders and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army as follows:

    Chairman Mao:

    From Shaanxi Public School to North China University, from Yan'an to Beiping, for twelve years, under your ideological guidance, we have cultivated tens of thousands of young people to become revolutionary cadres, most of whom have become outstanding Communist Party members. They are now fighting heroically and victoriously on the front lines and in various places. All this glory belongs to the people, to our Party, and to your wise leadership. On this school anniversary, we extend to you our highest respect. In the future, we will abide by your instructions, be prudent and humble, guard against arrogance and impetuosity, and redouble our efforts to cultivate a large number of construction talents. We wish you good health.

    Wu Yuzhang, Fan Wenlan, Cheng Fangwu, Principals of North China University, and all faculty, staff, and students

    To Commander-in-Chief Zhu and all commanders and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army:

    On the anniversary of our school, just as our People's Liberation Army is about to complete the glorious task of liberating the whole country, we extend to you our highest respect and deep condolences. In the future, we will train more revolutionary cadres to support you so that the liberation of all of China will come more quickly.

    Wu Yuzhang, Fan Wenlan, Cheng Fangwu and all faculty, staff and students of North China University
