Xinhua News Agency, Northwest Front, 5th: The Tibetan people in southwestern Gansu Province have risen up to intercept the remnants of the Hu-Ma bandits. After most of the Hu bandits' 2nd Gendarmerie Battalion and 7th Engineer Regiment remnants were annihilated by our army in the Hezhen and Linxia areas, a portion of their fleeing soldiers attempted to escape into the Tibetan areas. On August 25th, they窜抵达 (cuàn dǐ dá)夏河县 (xià hé xiàn)南 (nán)140华里 (huá lǐ)地区 (dì qū)crawled to an area 140 *li* south of Xiahe County. Local Tibetans, led by Yang Shijie, the Tusi of Renze Banner, gathered more than 600 laborers and rose up to intercept them, annihilating most of the remnant bandits, capturing 46 bandits alive, and killing or wounding over 20. They seized three light machine guns, two submachine guns, six pistols, and eleven rifles.

Xinhua News Agency, Northwest Front, 5th: The People's Liberation Army has launched attacks from Guanzhong for several days, breaking through the Qinling defense line of the Hu bandit Zong Nan, and is continuing to advance towards Hanzhong. Prior to this, the Hu bandits, attempting to take advantage of the PLA's valiant westward advance after the liberation of Lanzhou, had raided Baoji City in the latter half of last month. When the bandits advanced to the vicinity of Yimen Town outside Baoji, the PLA immediately inserted itself behind enemy lines according to a pre-determined plan, coordinating with a frontal attack. The PLA's right-wing troops launched an attack at 13:00 on the 29th, and successively occupied key points such as Wulinzi and Aikou in the Qinling Mountains by 14:00. The left wing captured Guanyintang at 05:00 on the 31st, and occupied Da Wang Mountain at 07:00, advancing 60 *li* along the Sichuan-Shaanxi Highway. The left and right wing forces victoriously converged south of the Qinling Mountains and north of Dongjiao Bridge. Under the PLA's pincer attack, the Hu bandits fled in disarray. The so-called Qinling defense line of the Hu bandits was completely breached, and the east gate of Hanzhong was wide open. According to incomplete statistics, in the above attacks, the PLA captured over 1,000 soldiers of the Hu bandit 38th Army's 177th Division, and seized some military supplies and grain. The PLA is currently expanding its gains.

    【新华社西北前线五日电】甘肃西南部藏族人民奋起截击胡马残匪。胡匪宪兵第二营及工兵第七团残部于和政、临夏地区大部为我军歼灭后，其溃兵一部妄图逃入藏区，八月二十五日窜抵夏河县南一百四十华里地区，当地藏民在任则旗土司杨世杰率领下，集合六百余民工奋起截击，歼灭残匪大部，计生俘匪四十六名，毙伤匪二十余名。缴获轻机枪三挺，冲锋枪两支，手枪六支，步枪十一支。
    【新华社西北前线五日电】人民解放军连日自关中出击，突破胡匪宗南之秦岭防线，并续向汉中推进中。在此之前胡匪妄图乘解放军解放兰州奋勇西进之际，曾于上月下旬窜扰宝鸡市。当匪进抵宝鸡外围之益门镇附近时，解放军即按照预定计划，插入敌后，配合正面出击。解放军右翼部队于二十九日下午一时发动攻击，二时相继占领秦岭之五林子、隘口等要点；左翼于三十一日晨五时攻占观音堂，七时即占领大王山，沿川陕公路前进六十里。左右两翼部队当在秦岭以南东皎桥以北胜利会师。在解放军左右夹击下，胡匪狼狈溃散。胡匪之所谓秦岭防线乃被完全突破，汉中东门洞开。据不完全统计：在上述攻击中，解放军生俘胡匪三十八军一七七师一千余人，缴获军用物资及粮食各一部。现解放军正扩张战果中。
