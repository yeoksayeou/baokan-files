　　Heze Private Consumer Industry and Commerce
  　Are Vigorously Shifting to Egg Processing and Other Industries
  　All Industries Have Raised Funds to Go to Shanghai to Purchase Machinery
    [Xinxiang News] Following the example of Hengtai, Xinfeng, and other five cigarette factories in Heze that raised funds to switch to the machine oil extraction industry, a large number of consumer industrialists and merchants are actively raising funds to prepare for the shift to egg processing, match, and textile industries. Since Heze's liberation in September of last year, after publicizing industrial and commercial policies, rectifying taxation, conducting industrial and commercial surveys, organizing the market, registering merchants, and reorganizing the Commercial Federation, industrialists and merchants have understood the democratic government's policy of restoring and developing industry and commerce. In particular, silk shops and all luxury consumer industrialists and merchants have, over the past year, recognized and appreciated the prospects of developing industry in a people's city under the education of the People's Government. Therefore, when the oil pressing plant started operation on June 20th, under the leadership of state-owned enterprises, the Bureau of Industry and Commerce, the bank, and the Chengguan Industrial and Commercial Federation, a general committee for transition preparation was formed by absorbing those who wanted to switch industries. According to the requirements of each transitioner, three preparatory sub-committees for match, egg processing, and spinning were formed. Whoever wanted to switch to which industry would become a preparatory member of that industry's sub-committee. Around August 8th, each sub-committee held meetings to study preparatory matters separately. The match factory sub-committee planned to raise 30 million yuan, and the egg processing factory planned to raise 50 million yuan. When funds are insufficient, state banks will provide loans for support. The spinning factory planned for a 1,000-spindle spinning machine. Each share would be ten catties of cotton, requiring the raising of 3,500 to 5,000 shares.
    Currently, the members of each sub-committee are actively absorbing shares. Hengtai, Xinfeng, Zhenda, Shuguang and other private cigarette factories are preparing to transfer one-half of the entire funds of the cigarette factory to the match factory, with the remaining one-half of the funds to be jointly operated by nine cigarette factories. The department store industry (more than a dozen) proposed to transfer all funds to the match factory. Heze's largest grocery industry, with 500,000 yuan in capital (according to April statistics), will take out all of it to switch industries. The egg processing factory currently has twenty-seven members, divided into five groups. Each group proposes to guarantee the mobilization of fifty shareholders, and each person plans to mobilize five, and also calls on workers to invest through the trade union. The general preparatory committee has sent people to Shanghai to purchase power machines, match machines, and spinning machines, and is planning factory sites. It is estimated that the match factory can start operation before the end of the year. The egg processing factory decided to start operation next spring because it is seasonal (autumn eggs are empty, clear, less yellow, and spring eggs are solid, clear, more yellow). Spinning and other industries will be decided after the cotton harvest in the autumn.

　　菏泽私营消费工商业
  　纷纷转营打蛋等业
  　各业已集资赴沪采购机器
    【新乡讯】菏泽私营工商业者，继恒泰、信丰等五家烟厂集资转营机器榨油工业之后，又有大批消费工商业者积极集资，筹备转营打蛋、火柴、纺织工业。菏泽自去年九月解放以来，经过宣传工商业政策、整理税收、进行工商业调查、市场整理、行商登记、改组商联会等工作之后，使工商业者了解了民主政府恢复发展工商业的政策。特别是绸缎庄及一切奢侈品等消费工商业者，一年来在人民政府的教育下认识和体会到人民城市发展工业的前途。于是当榨油厂六月二十日开工以后，八月初在国营企业、工商局、银行及城关工商联合会领导之下，吸收转业者组成转业筹委总会，当根据各转业者要求，组成火柴、打蛋、纺纱三个筹委分会，谁愿转那业即为该业分会筹备委员。八月八日前后，各分会分别开会研究筹备事宜。火柴厂分会计划集资三千万元，打蛋厂计划集资五千万元，不足时，由国家银行贷款扶植。纺纱厂计划一千锭子纺纱机，每股十斤棉花，须集资三千五百至五千股。
    现各分会委员正积极吸收股金，恒泰、信丰、振大、曙光等私营烟厂准备把烟厂整个资金二分之一转入火柴厂，剩下二分之一资金，分别由九个烟厂合并营业。百货业（十余家）提出全部资金转入火柴厂。菏泽最大杂货业五十万资金（据四月份统计）将全部拿出转业。打蛋厂现有二十七个委员，分为五个组。每组提出保证动员五十个股东，一个人计划动员五个，并通过职工会号召工人入股。总筹委会已派人赴上海购买动力机、火柴机、纺纱机，并计划厂址等。估计火柴厂年前可开工。打蛋厂因带季节性（秋天蛋空清少黄多，春天蛋实清多黄少）故决定明年春天开工。纺纱等秋后棉花收下再决定。
