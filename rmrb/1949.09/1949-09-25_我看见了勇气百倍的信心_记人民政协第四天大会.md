　　I Saw Hundredfold Courage and Confidence
  　A Record of the Fourth Day of the People's Political Consultative Conference
    Li Zhuang
    At yesterday's conference, I saw the harmonious and seamless unity of the representatives; even more, I saw the representatives' hundredfold courage and confidence. United around the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the speaking representatives unanimously guaranteed that they would build the new China well.
    The representatives greeted Commander-in-Chief Zhu's speech with fervent feelings and thunderous applause. Commander-in-Chief Zhu said "I guarantee to everyone" three times in a row: guaranteeing to carry the revolutionary war to the end and liberate all of China's territory; to defend China's independence and the integrity of its territorial sovereignty, and to defend the revolutionary achievements and all legitimate rights and interests of the Chinese people; to establish a unified and modern national defense force to protect our great motherland and people. For decades, how many ferocious enemies have been defeated by our People's Liberation Army, and how many difficulties that no ordinary person could endure have been overcome by us. General Zhang Yunyi said: The South China Liberation Army has persisted in guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines against the Chiang bandits for twenty years, and is now actively cooperating with the southward People's Liberation Army to liberate all of South China. Lian Guan, the chief representative of the South China liberated area, said: The people of South China are making various preparations to welcome the southward liberation army... The speeches of the three representatives constitute a magnificent picture. On a front of thousands of miles, we are chasing the defeated enemy; when all of China is liberated in the near future, millions of troops will stand tall on the long defense line of the people's motherland, letting those imperialists squat on the other side of the ocean, worrying, anxious, and quietly dying!
    The working class has always been one to "endure hardship and do much work." Liu Yingyuan, a specially invited labor hero representative, introduced many model deeds of the working class at the conference. The young workers of the Tianjin No. 3 Cotton Mill dared to stand up when the enemy was still holding weapons, disarming more than thirty enemies and protecting the factory from any damage. Within seven days of liberation, the entire factory resumed work. The Anshan Iron and Steel Plant quickly changed its appearance after liberation. The workers repaired two steelmaking furnaces in seven months, while under Kuomintang occupation, it took twenty-one months to repair only one. Liu Yingyuan said: "Once we working people truly become masters of our own country, we will cherish the future of our motherland as our own lives." Liu Yingyuan described the three major draft documents as "the great charter protecting our working people," and that "the working people must unite with all democratic and patriotic strata in the country under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao to fight together." His speech won thunderous applause. Because, people have deeply experienced that with the leadership of the working class, there will be solutions to everything.
    Representative Zhang Nanxian delivered an enthusiastic, concise, and powerful speech at the meeting. Old Zhang is already seventy-six years old this year, and has experienced much hardship and has rich experience. Several elderly people in his group, in their seventies and eighties, have consistently refused to participate in any political meetings for decades. But this time, "the convening of the People's Political Consultative Conference, everyone was overjoyed, disregarding their old age, and resolutely participated." The whole audience warmly applauded to congratulate these old people who have experienced many changes, and it can also be said that they are congratulating the People's Political Consultative Conference itself. These old people have been choosing for decades, and now they have truly chosen correctly. Representative Zhang said: "Judging from the participation of these few old gentlemen, it can truly represent the heartfelt support of the people of the whole country for the People's Government." Great unity has increased people's great confidence, and the People's Central Government that will soon be established will guarantee that these elderly people will spend their twilight years in a democratic, free, and happy atmosphere.
    The new China has brought the greatest confidence and hope to overseas Chinese living abroad. Representative Chen Jiageng said: The residences of overseas Chinese are either capitalist countries or their colonies. Overseas Chinese are subjected to increasing discrimination, abuse, and persecution, and their desire for the independence and strength of the motherland is the most ardent. The Common Program of the People's Political Consultative Conference, especially the ethnic and foreign policies within it, can guarantee to liberate overseas Chinese from their current tragic situation. Therefore, Mr. Chen "on behalf of overseas Chinese democratic人士 and patriotic overseas Chinese, is willing to accept the three draft documents without reservation" and "strive to promote their realization." Representative Chen Qiyou said: "Overseas Chinese have always worked hard for the democratic revolution of the motherland. And their strength is strong and should not be underestimated." Now, the strong power of overseas Chinese can be fully utilized, they have a real motherland, and the constitution of the motherland has clearly stated that it will protect the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese.
    Representatives of ethnic minorities, students, women, and those in free professions also made guarantees to the conference, guaranteeing to thoroughly implement the three major draft documents and build the new China into a strong and beautiful one. Many representatives explained the three major draft documents from their own past experiences, current demands, and future hopes, all praising and celebrating them. These draft documents represent all the people of our country, and therefore also represent any part of them. Everyone started from different angles, with one heart and one mind, and achieved a unified result. Many representatives shouted "Long live the People's Republic of China" and "Long live the Communist Party and Chairman Mao" after they finished speaking, which is completely natural. With Chairman Mao's wise leadership, and with the confidence and efforts of the people of the whole country, "the great cause of nation-building will inevitably succeed, and it is already a thousand truths and ten thousand certainties."

　　我看见了勇气百倍的信心
  　记人民政协第四天大会
    李庄
    在昨天的大会上，我看见了代表们融洽无间的团结；更看见了代表们勇气百倍的信心。团结在共产党、毛主席的周围，发言的代表一致保证：一定要把新中国建设好。
    代表们以狂热的心情、狂热的掌声迎接朱总司令的发言。朱总司令一连说了三次“我向大家保证”：保证把革命战争进行到底，解放全中国的领土；保卫中国的独立和领土主权的完整，保卫中国人民的革命成果和一切合法权益；建立一支统一的现代化的国防军，保卫我们伟大的祖国和人民。几十年来，多少凶恶的敌人都被我们的解放军打败了，绝非常人所能忍受的困难都被我们克服了。张云逸将军说：华南解放军在蒋匪敌后坚持了二十年的游击战争，现正积极配合南下人民解放军作战，解放全华南。华南解放区首席代表连贯说：华南人民正在多方准备，迎接南下的解放大军……三位代表的发言构成一幅壮丽的图画。在几千里的战线上，我们正在追逐败退的敌人；在不久的将来全中国解放的时候，几百万大军雄峙在人民祖国漫长的国防线上，让那些帝国主义者们蹲在大洋的彼岸，烦恼、焦急、悄悄的死去吧！
    工人阶级从来是“吃得苦，作得多”的。特邀劳动英雄代表刘英源在大会上介绍了许多工人阶级的模范事迹。天津中纺三厂的青年工友，在敌人还拿着武器的时候，敢于挺身出来，解除三十多个敌人的武装，保护工厂不受丝毫损失。解放以后七天，就使全部工厂复工了。鞍山炼钢厂解放以后，很快的变了样子。职工们七个月修复了两部炼钢炉，在国民党占领时，二十一个月只修好了一部。刘英源说：“一到我们劳动人民真正作了自己国家的主人，我们就把祖国的前途当作自己的生命一样来爱护。”刘英源把三大草案说成是“保护我们劳动人民的大宪章”，“劳动人民一定要在中国共产党毛主席领导之下，与全国各民主爱国阶层团结一起，共同奋斗。”他的讲话博得雷动的掌声。因为，人们都已深深的体验到，有了工人阶级的领导，什么都会有办法了。
    张难先代表在会上发表了热情横溢、简短有力的演说。张老今年已有七十六岁的高龄，饱经沧桑，阅历丰富。他那个组里有几位七、八十岁的老人，数十年来始终不愿参加什么政治性的会议。但是这次“召开的人民政治协商会议，大家都欢欣鼓舞，不顾衰老，毅然参加”了。全场热烈鼓掌庆贺这些久历事变的老人，也可以说是庆贺人民政治协商会议的本身。这些老人选择了几十年，现在真正选对了。张代表说：“就这几位老先生之参加看来，真可以代表全国人民心悦诚服的拥护人民政府。”大团结给人们增加了大信心，即将成立的人民中央政府，会保证这些老年人在民主、自由、愉快的空气中，度过他们的晚年。
    新中国给远在国外的侨胞带来了最大的信心和希望。陈嘉庚代表说：华侨的居留地不是资本主义国家，便是他们的殖民地。侨胞受到与日俱深的歧视、凌虐和迫害，渴望祖国的独立、强盛最为殷切。人民政协的共同纲领，特别是其中的民族政策与外交政策，可以保证把侨胞从现在的悲惨境遇中解放出来。因此，陈先生“代表海外华侨民主人士以及爱国侨胞，对于三个草案愿意无保留的接受”，并“努力促进实现”。陈其尤代表说：“华侨对于祖国的民主革命，素来努力。且其力量雄厚，未可轻视。”现在，侨胞的雄厚力量可以充分发挥出来了，他们有了真正的祖国，祖国的宪章上已经写明了，要保护侨胞的合法权益。
    少数民族、学生、妇女、女人、自由职业界的代表发言时，也都向大会作了保证，保证彻底实现三大草案，把新中国建设得强盛而美丽。许多代表从自己过去的经验、当前的要求、未来的希望解释三大草案，都是歌颂称扬，欢呼庆祝。这些草案代表了我国全体人民，当然也就代表了其中任何一部分人。大家从不同的角度出发，万众同心，得到了统一的结果。许多代表讲完了话，都高呼“中华人民共和国万岁”，“共产党、毛主席万岁”，这是完全自然的。有了毛主席的英明领导，有了全国人民的信心和努力，“建国大业必然成功，已是千真万确的了。”
