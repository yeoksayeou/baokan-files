　　Important Correction
    In the last paragraph of the "Current Commentary" on the first page of this newspaper on the 16th, the phrase "is already an all-too-obvious fact" in the thirteenth line should be moved to after "the invincibility of the people's democratic forces" in the fifteenth line. This correction is hereby made.
