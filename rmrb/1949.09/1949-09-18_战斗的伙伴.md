　　Second Squad Leader led Wang Chouzi back to the squad from the company headquarters. The men in the squad were chatting idly. Seeing the squad leader bring in a "liberated soldier" (i.e., a prisoner of war), they understood that this was a new recruit to fill the ranks, and they all stood up. The squad leader introduced him, and everyone welcomed him warmly. Chouzi stood ramrod straight and silent. When asked questions or invited to sit down or offered water, he would just answer "Yes." The squad leader explained to him, "Don't be so reserved. Our revolutionary army isn't like the Kuomintang army!"
　　Wang Chouzi was originally a poor peasant. He lost his parents when he was just a little over ten years old, and with no one to rely on, he did odd jobs for the landlord for the past two or three decades. Now he was forty-three years old, and had no family besides himself. After Japan surrendered in 1945, when the Kuomintang bandit army attacked the border region, Hu Zongnan needed conscripts, and he was used by the landlord as a substitute for conscription into the "Central Army". He served in the bandit puppet Third Army until he was liberated during the Qingfengdian Campaign in October 1947. After being liberated, he joined the Third Column's supplementary training regiment and was assigned to the artillery in February 1948. Because he had developed a kind of blind obedience in the "Central Army," he was very restrained when everyone asked him to sit down. At this moment, Pan Jinlin, who was sitting by the door, threw his shoe down hard and walked out of the room.
　　Pan Jinlin was an old soldier and a liberated peasant. In the winter of 1946, his father sent him to join the People's Liberation Army. He was only twenty years old this year, and a handsome and capable young man. Dark red cheeks, broad shoulders, tall stature. His two eyes seemed particularly bright. He was usually a fun-loving person. This time, he was overjoyed to hear that new recruits were being added, and he even took out the new shoes he had saved to give to the new recruit. But when the new recruit arrived, he threw down his shoes and walked out. The squad leader saw this and sensed that there was a problem. So he followed Jinlin out of the house. The two of them walked into the courtyard, and the squad leader asked, "Pan Jinlin! Why are you in such a bad mood?" Jinlin said, "Good mood? What's good about it!" The squad leader asked again, "Why?" Pan Jinlin said, "It's a joke! Why did a 'trophy' come to our squad?"
　　Jinlin hated liberated soldiers. He thought it was incomprehensible that someone could be an enemy yesterday and a comrade today. The squad leader explained to him, "Comrade! That's not the right way to think. Although he was our enemy in the past, as long as we reform him and educate him well, he can still be a revolutionary!"
　　"'Trophies' can't be revolutionaries. Besides, even if he does become a revolutionary, you'll have to carry him! Can that old guy even walk thirty miles?" Jinlin said contemptuously. The squad leader explained to him again, "Don't underestimate him just because he's old. As long as his thinking changes, he can still do things!"
　　For several days, Jinlin and Wang Chouzi could not get along. Chouzi's every move annoyed him. For example, when eating, if Chouzi wanted to take food from one bowl, Jinlin would deliberately take food from another bowl. The two of them didn't speak to each other. Jinlin was usually quite talkative, but he had nothing to say when he saw Chouzi. But on this particular day, the squad leader sent Jinlin and Chouzi to chop grass. This made both of them unhappy, but they couldn't refuse the squad leader's order, so they reluctantly went. This may have been done deliberately by the squad leader!
　　One moved the chopper and the other moved the grass. Jinlin lifted the handle of the chopper, and Chouzi filled it with grass. After they chopped a pile of grass, neither of them said a word to the other. Jinlin felt it was a disgrace to talk to a liberated soldier. Chouzi was not a talkative person to begin with, and seeing Jinlin's attitude these past few days, he knew that Jinlin disliked him, so he didn't want to open his mouth either. Jinlin was too tired to work, but he was too embarrassed to say it, but he couldn't push the knife down any longer. Chouzi saw that he was tired and said, "Let's call it a day! We've chopped a lot already!" Jinlin had wanted to stop for a while, so this was perfect. He threw down the chopper and ignored it.
　　Everyone was chatting in the courtyard while drinking water. The deputy squad leader said, "Comrade Wang Chouzi chops the grass so finely! It all falls through the sieve!" Zhang Fengyou said, "Pan Jinlin and Wang Chouzi are like father and son!" Everyone laughed. The squad leader said to Wang Chouzi, "Old Wang! You must have done this a lot at home?" Wang Chouzi said, "I'm not good at anything else, but I've done a lot of this!"
　　"How many animals do you feed at home?" another comrade asked. This made it difficult for Wang Chouzi to answer. If he said it, he was afraid others would call him a "poor wretch." If he didn't say it, he couldn't answer, so he simply said, "I feed a lot of animals, but none of them are mine!" Even if he didn't say it, others understood that he was working for others. The squad leader asked, "How many years did you work for others?" "From fourteen straight to forty!"
　　"How did you become a soldier?" someone asked.
　　"I was a substitute for conscription!" he said softly.
　　"Do you have any family?" the deputy squad leader asked.
　　"I don't have anyone!" he said with a sad look.
　　"Don't you have any children?" Zhang Fengyou asked.
　　"How can I have children if I've never married a wife?!" When he said this, some people laughed, but he himself felt sad and began to cry. Others didn't know why and looked at him without saying anything. The squad leader walked over and gently asked, "Wang Chouzi! Why are you crying?" The squad leader pulled him aside to talk, and then he understood why he was crying. The squad leader explained to Chouzi, "Don't cry. Crying won't get you revenge. If you want revenge, you have to make revolution!" Chouzi didn't understand what "revolution" meant. He kept thinking, "If you want revenge, you have to make revolution! Revolution!..."
　　One morning, rows of soldiers walked into the meeting place and sat on the ground. The surrounding walls were covered with slogans written on white paper and cartoons. They read the sentences in their hearts and looked at the posted cartoons, learning about Wang Chouzi's life.
　　"Comrades!" the instructor said in a low voice, "We are all from 'poor wretch' backgrounds! In the past, we were exploited and oppressed by landlords. We had no place to seek justice, no place to tell our suffering! Now we want revenge! We want to pour out our bitterness." Then the literacy teacher said, "First, let Comrade Wang Chouzi talk about his suffering."
　　The tall, broad-shouldered, slightly hunched Wang Chouzi stood before everyone. More than two hundred eyes were staring at him. His thin face with its black mustache turned pale, and his parched lips trembled, unable to speak. After a long time, the instructor told him not to rush, and he finally began to tell his story. As he spoke, his voice became lower and more painful. Tears welled up in his eyes and dripped down onto his coat. Those who were watching him slowly lowered their heads. The instructor asked softly, "Comrade Wang Chouzi! Your father was beaten to death by the landlord. Does it hurt?" Wang Chouzi bit his lip and said nothing.
　　After Chouzi told his story, everyone learned that his family had been ruined by the landlord. After Pan Jinlin heard Wang Chouzi's story, he remembered that his sister had died the same way as Chouzi's sister, both having been forced to hang themselves after being forcibly taken by the landlord. Jinlin also told his story and resolved to avenge his sister. After the complaint meeting ended, everyone shouted slogans: "We will always follow the Communist Party!" "Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, we will avenge the millions of parents, siblings who died tragically!" ...
　　After the complaint meeting, Chouzi understood the meaning of "revolution." That night, he was on duty watching the horses, sitting by an oil lamp. His elbows rested on a broken leather box, and his hands supported his chin. He didn't know what he was thinking. The wind blew the scraps of grass on the ground, rustling. The old mule snorted, and the little mule kicked, hitting the ground with a "pop!" Chouzi suddenly stood up, walked to the old mule, stopped, and said in a low voice, "Revenge! Revenge!! Revolution! Revolution!! Capture the landlord boss—capture Chiang Kai-shek alive and slice him up piece by piece!"
　　"Hey—" Pan Jinlin saw that he was talking to himself with such enthusiasm, so he pulled up his pants and walked over. Chouzi turned around and asked, "Are you here to take over?" Jinlin said, "You still have to learn how to take over!"
　　"Then why aren't you sleeping?" Chouzi asked.
　　Jinlin tightened his waistband and said, "Old Wang! Your suffering is greater than mine. Let's make a plan to earn merit! Do you agree?" "How can I disagree! Tell me how to make it?" Chouzi said.
　　After the two of them made the plan, Jinlin took over the watch. Chouzi went to sleep. Chouzi was thinking about how to carry out the plan to earn merit, and also thought about how he had worked for thirty years without even earning a wife. So he became distressed. The more he thought about it, the more sad he became...
　t sleep, got up again, put on his clothes, and walked into the street, walking back and forth.
　　　　II
　　Following the victories of Qingfengdian and Shijiazhuang, the Jin-Cha-Ji Field Army returned from the plains of central Hebei to the mountainous area of southern Chahar. This brought warmth and joy to the naked children of southern Chahar, and the old men also cracked their mouths into smiles. They smiled and said, "The Communist Party hasn't forgotten us!" "Commander Nie knows our suffering!"
　　Pulling the first mule at the head of the artillery column was Wang Chouzi. Although Chouzi was over forty years old, he was full of energy when marching. He looked back at Pan Jinlin, whose rosy face was covered in golden sweat, and who was swaying and following closely behind him. He jokingly said, "Be careful! Don't twist your ankle!" Jinlin simply replied, "It's okay!"
　　Although Jinlin's feet weren't small, he got four or five big blisters on this day. He kept hurrying, in unbearable pain. But if he didn't keep up, he would violate the "guarantee not to fall behind in the march" clause in his plan to earn merit. So, he endured the pain, limping and following closely behind. Chouzi looked back and said, "What's wrong, Jinlin? Did you twist it?" Jinlin bluntly replied, "Just keep walking! I won't fall behind!"
　　The eighty-mile march ended, and people lay down wearily. They weren't lying on warm beds in heated rooms, but on open mountain slopes in southern Chahar. This was Xiaoxueshan, which they would never forget. Everyone knew that the climate in southern Chahar was several times colder than in central Hebei, especially when camping on this snow-covered slope that was more than half a foot thick. Chouzi put his quilt over the mule's body. He pulled the old mule around and around. His teeth chattered. The mule's hooves stepped on the frozen snow with a crunching sound. The weather was really cold, but the steely warriors had conquered everything. Just like they often said, "The bones of the poor are hard!" Yes, only they could endure such cold for the people.
　　The difficult night finally passed. The sun they had been waiting for climbed out of the east. They were happy. They laughed, talked, and packed their bags. Jinlin stretched and said, "I was a regimental commander all night!" (Curled up in a ball because of the cold) Chouzi rebuked him unceremoniously, "You're talking nonsense again!"
　　"What nonsense is this? This is 'seeking truth from facts'!" Jinlin said arrogantly.
　　"Okay! When we review the plan, you'll know whether it's nonsense or not!" Chouzi said while packing his bag.
　　Then came the march again. Chouzi pulled his comrade—the old mule—carrying two backpacks (helping someone else carry one). He followed closely behind the company commander, singing as he walked. His rough voice sang a little tune.
　　The mobile warfare unfolded in southern Chahar, and the Jin-Cha-Ji soldiers walked to the front line; not afraid of high mountains and long roads, not afraid of sore legs and aching backs. ...
　　Jinlin, who was walking behind Chouzi, limped and started singing the training song in a shrill voice:
　　Liu Heizi Wang Erdan, hey! Let's quickly practice our skills, practice our skills well, perform meritorious service for the people and go to the front line, hey! To the front line! ...
　　At this moment, a large mountain appeared in front of them. This mountain wasn't very high. It was said to be a little over seven li to the top. Chouzi shouted, "Be a steely hero and meet at the top of the mountain, be a soft mud egg and be ashamed!" Young lads all had the spirit of not falling behind. Who wanted to be a soft mud egg? Everyone's excited shouts and songs shook the valley. Jinlin started singing the Eighth Route Army March in his shrill voice again:
　　...Forward, forward! Our army is like the sun, towards the plains of North China, towards the mountains of the border—!
　　One large mountain had passed. A large river blocked their way forward again. This was the Sanggan River in southern Chahar. The river water was rushing, and the sun shone on the surface of the water, reflecting dazzling light. They were on the river bank, preparing to cross the river. A cavalry messenger walked up to the company commander and said, "Within an hour, your company will go to a certain village to carry out a mission! ..."
　　The sun went down, and the weather got cold again. How cold the icy water was! The urgent order meant they couldn't delay another minute. Wang Chouzi pulled the mule and jumped into the river. The chest-deep water was bone-chillingly cold. His trembling hands tightly held the mule's reins, slowly moving forward. The rocks at the bottom of the river were slippery, and the waves washed over his head. He fell, and the current washed him more than ten feet away. Jinlin rushed into the water, hugged Chouzi and asked, "Chouzi! Chouzi! Did you swallow a mouthful?" Chouzi's lips trembled and said, "It's okay, it's okay!" Chouzi pulled the mule and walked, unconsciously saying, "Be careful! Be careful!" He was being careful, but the mule fell into the water again. Chouzi hurriedly untied the bellyband and pulled the mule and the gun carriage to the shore.
　　　　III
　　They crossed the Sanggan River and detoured for six or seven li before reaching the vicinity of Huashaoying. Huashaoying was a large stronghold where two regiments of the Kuomintang Provisional Fourth Army were stationed. The mission was to cleanly wipe out these two regiments. Therefore, the artillery's responsibility was great. That is to say, the length of time it would take to wipe out these two regiments would depend on whether the artillery could overwhelm the enemy's firepower.
　　In the darkness, the artillery fire filled the sky. There was fire everywhere, bullets everywhere. You could be hit by a bullet at any moment. Wang Chouzi was carrying out an important task in this hail of bullets. He hadn't slept all night and hadn't eaten for two days. He had several sores on his lips, and his sweat-soaked cotton coat. After the night passed, the red sun rose. Chouzi carried three artillery shells and ran at the front of the transport team. He looked back and shouted to everyone, "Hurry! Hurry!" Others bent over and quickly ran over. They were resting at the bend in the communication trench. Chouzi lay on the edge of the trench, observing the gun holes in the pillbox, occasionally firing crisp shots. After he had a good look at the terrain, he said to everyone, "Comrades! There are still more than sixty meters to the artillery position. The slope is a thirty-odd meter blocked area. Let's pass through in groups!" After he finished speaking, he ran up the slope. He looked back and saw several people running upright like fools. He shouted loudly, "Crawl forward!" Jinlin was following behind him. He had just crawled ten meters when he was hit. Chouzi heard him shout "Ah!" Seeing that Jinlin wasn't moving, he ran over, picked him up and ran back into the trench. As he ran, a shot hit his right thigh. He said, "Damn your grandmother!" and hurriedly ran into the trench.
　　"Jinlin! Jinlin! Where were you hit?" Chouzi asked kindly.
　　"It's okay, I was hit in the arm!" Jinlin replied.
　　Chouzi took out the first-aid kit, bandaged Pan Jinlin and said, "You rest for a while! Don't go out!" But his own thigh was still bleeding. He wrapped his leg with a piece of torn pants and went back to carrying out his task. Enduring the pain in his thigh, he crawled forward. Five artillery shells shuttled forward under the command of his two withered hands. His task was completed. He reported to the platoon leader, who sent Zhang Fengyou to carry him back. Chouzi said kindly, "Don't worry about me! I'll go back myself!" Zhang Fengyou insisted on carrying him, but he resolutely refused. Zhang Fengyou had no choice but to say, "This is the platoon leader's order!" Chouzi smiled and said, "Don't carry out this order! I'll be responsible later!" Zhang Fengyou didn't achieve his goal with the word "order," and he couldn't think of a way. Chouzi said again, "You still have a mission!" After he finished speaking, he left.
　　The second time, Chouzi carried three artillery shells again. The deputy company commander stopped him and wouldn't let him deliver them anymore. He refused and said, "Deputy company commander! I won't carry out your order. 'Don't leave the front line with minor injuries' is my plan. I want to carry out my plan!" The deputy company commander couldn't stop him. Jinlin saw that Old Wang, who was more seriously injured than him, was like this, so he also carried three artillery shells and said, "Old Wang! Today is the opportunity to perform meritorious service for the people!!"
　　The battle ended. At the democratic meeting, the first person to propose earning merit was Wang Chouzi. The second was Pan Jinlin. Because they two had performed meritorious service, the comrades in the entire company respected them even more. They also gave the two of them a title, calling Wang Chouzi "Old Hero" and Pan Jinlin "Little Hero." They were happy, but they were still very modest, saying, "This is everyone's credit! Without everyone's help, how could we have performed meritorious service!"
　　After Wang Chouzi performed meritorious service, all the squads put forward the slogan "Learn from the Old Hero." This made Wang Chouzi worry. He said, "I don't know a single big character. What can you learn from me?!" That's what he said, but he was also a little happy in his heart. His humility and his progress made everyone in the company admire him.
　　One day, the branch held a general meeting, which was a "self-report public discussion" to recruit party members. The first to sign up was Wang Chouzi. After he said the conditions for his joining the party, he also said his aspirations for joining the party. He said, "I am willing to follow the Communist Party for the rest of my life. The Communist Party is my home, and the Communist Party is my benefactor! I will resolutely serve the people under the leadership of the Party!! I had some shortcomings in the past. Once, I had an unclear understanding of the revolution and wanted to jump into a well to die. Later, I thought about it. If I died, I wouldn't be able to avenge myself, so I didn't jump into the well!" After he finished speaking, everyone began to evaluate his conditions. Finally, Pan Jinlin expressed his opinion. He said, "I agree with Wang Chouzi joining the party, but he still has a selfish thought. When he's on duty feeding the animals, he puts the feed in his mule's trough first. This has to be overcome..." Everyone unanimously agreed to his joining the party.
　　The form had been sent for ten days, but it hadn't been approved yet, and Wang Chouzi felt a little depressed. There was no march today. Others were washing clothes and sewing shoes, but he was sitting in the sun, frowning. He sat with his legs apart, stirring the ground with a stick. He thought, "Why haven't they approved me yet? Are my conditions not good enough?" He thought again about the opinion Jinlin had given him. He suddenly stood up, walked into the house, and lay down on the kang to sleep. The deputy squad leader came back from the company headquarters and saw that Wang Chouzi was asleep and shouted, "Old Wang!" Chouzi sat up without saying anything.
　　"Are you unhappy?" the deputy squad leader asked.
　　"Happy!" Chouzi replied vaguely.
　　"We're in the same group!" the deputy squad leader said.
　　"Was it approved?" Chouzi asked nervously.
　　"Yeah: Five months of probationary period!" the deputy squad leader said.
　　Wang Chouzi joined the party. He himself was happy, excited, and honored. Others also felt honored and happy. Everyone smoked cigarettes, peeled peanuts, and celebrated Chouzi's new birthday. What about Jinlin? When he heard that Chouzi had joined the party, he was also very happy, and he respected him from the bottom of his heart.
　　　　IV
　　One day, at night, people were sleeping soundly when a messenger from the company headquarters came to transmit an emergency assembly. Ten minutes later, the troops began to depart.
　　The mission on the first position was completed, and then they transferred to the second position. Seven or eight people pushed a cannon weighing several thousand pounds, speeding through the mud. The mud flew up and landed on Wang Chouzi's body and face. Chouzi shouted. He shouted "Complete the mission and make war contributions!" "Strive for the entire squad to make contributions!" Everyone quickly passed through the blockade. The second position was no more than three hundred meters from the enemy. The shells fired hit every time. Chouzi jumped up happily and shouted "Avenge..." Unfortunately, he fell down. Pan Jinlin shouted "Something's wrong!" and suddenly picked up Chouzi, looked at Chouzi's pale face, and couldn't help but shed tears. He shouted, "Chouzi! Chouzi!" Chouzi slowly opened his eyes and said, "Revenge!" Pan Jinlin put down Chouzi's body and continued to carry out his task.
　　The battle ended. All the officers and soldiers of the company stood at attention in silence. After the instructor looked at Wang Chouzi's wound, he said sadly, "Comrade Wang Chouzi! You have gloriously sacrificed yourself. Your sacrifice has made us lose a resolute and tenacious comrade-in-arms! Dear comrade! We will avenge your blood feud for you. I represent the battalion party committee and announce the posthumous recognition of Comrade Wang Chouzi as a full member of the Communist Party of China!"

　　战斗的伙伴
  　　　　　一
    二班长领着王丑子，从连部回到班里。班里的人们正在闲唠着，见班长带着一个解放战士（即俘虏）走进来，大家都明白这是补充的新战士，就都站起来了。班长做了个介绍，大家很热烈的招待起来。丑子在当地立正站着一动不动，也不啃声，别人问他，让他坐下，给他端水喝，他就答个“是”字，班长向他解释说：“不要拘束，咱们革命队伍里不象国民党军队那样！”
    王丑子本是个穷苦农民，十来岁上就死了父母，没依靠，就给地主扛了小活，一直扛了二三十年。现在他四十三岁了，除了他自己家里再没别人。一九四五年日本投降后，国民党匪军进攻边区的时候胡宗南要壮丁，他就给地主抵壮丁当“中央军”了。在匪伪第三军当兵，直到一九四七年的十月间，才在清风店战役时被解放。解放后参加了三纵队补训团，四八年二月间补充到炮兵里。因为在“中央军”里养成了这种盲目的服从，所以大家让他坐下时，他是很拘束的。这个时候，坐在靠门边的潘金林，把手里拿的鞋子猛的一扔走出了屋去。
    潘金林是个老战士，翻身农民。一九四六年冬天里，他父亲送他参加了解放军。今年也不过二十岁，倒是一个漂亮精干的小伙子。黑红的脸蛋，宽宽的肩膀，高大的个儿。两颗眼球特别显得有神。是挺好开玩笑的人，这次他听说补充新战士，就喜欢的不行，把自己节约的新鞋子也拿出来，准备给新战士。新战士来了，他却把鞋子一扔走出去。班长一见这种情形，就捉摸着有问题。于是也随上金林出了屋。两个人走到当院，班长就问：“潘金林！你怎么情绪不高呢？”金林说：“高！高个球吧！”班长又问：“为什么呢？”潘金林说：“说也是球事！怎么给咱班来了个‘胜利品’呢？”
    金林是憎恶解放战士的，他认为昨天还是敌人，今天又是伙伴是说不通的。班长向他解释道：“同志！这样认识是不对的，虽然他过去是我们的敌人，只要我们很好的改造他、教育他、他还是一样的能革命！”
    “‘胜利品’怎么也不革命的，再说，革命吧，你还得背上他才行呢！那老家伙能走三十里路？”金林轻视地说。班长又向他解释说：“你不要看他老，只要思想转变了，一样能做事情！”
    几天来，金林和王丑子怎么也是和不来。丑子的一举一动都使他看不上眼，比如吃饭时，丑子要在这个盆里吃菜，金林就偏到那盆吃菜。两个人谁和谁也不说话。本来金林是挺爱叨叨的，可是一见丑子就没话了。偏在这一天，班长派金林和丑子去铡草。这可使他俩都不高兴起来，但是，班长的命令又不能说不去，只好勉强的去了。这也可能是班长故意这样做吧！
    两个人一个搬铡刀一个搬草，金林提起了铡刀柄，丑子就往里填草，俩人铡完一个草了，谁和谁也没说半句话。金林觉得和解放战士说话是个耻辱，丑子本来是个不好说话的人，见金林这几天的情形，也知道是腻外他，所以也不愿开口。金林累的不能干了，也不好意思的说，可是压不下刀去了。丑子见他没劲了便说：“算了吧！铡的不少了！”金林也早就想算了，这倒正好，他把铡刀一扔不管了。
    大家在院子里一边喝水一边扯着，副班长说：“王丑子同志铡的这草真碎！筛子底都漏过去了！”张凤友说：“潘金林和王丑子的年岁好象爷俩！”大家笑起来，班长向王丑子说：“老王！你在家里干这干的不少吧？”王丑子说：“别的不行，这玩意可干的不少！”
    “你家喂几个牲口？”另一个同志问。这可使王丑子不好回答了，说吧，怕别人说他是个“穷小子”，不说吧，又没法回答，还是简单的说：“喂的牲口可不少，可没咱的一个！”他不说别人也明白他是给人家扛活了，班长又问：“你给人家扛过几年活？”“从十四直扛到四十！”
    “怎么你又当兵了呢？”别人问。
    “给当家抵壮丁当的兵！”他轻声的说。
    “你家还有什么人？”副班长问。
    “什么人也没有！”他说着带有难过的样子。
    “你没孩子吗？”张凤友问。
    “没娶过媳妇那来的孩子？！”他这么一说，有的人笑起来，可是他自己却难受的流出眼泪。别人不知为什么，都看着他没的说。班长走过去轻轻的问道：“王丑子！你怎么哭起来了？”班长拉他去谈话，才知道他是为什么哭。班长向丑子解释说：“不要哭，哭是报不了仇的，要想报仇就要革命！”丑子那懂得“革命”是什么意思？他老是想着“要想报仇就要革命！革命！……”
    一天早晨，一排排的战士走进了会场，坐在土地上。周围的墙壁上，满布着白纸写的标语和画的漫画。他们在心里念着那些句子，看着张帖的漫画，知道了王丑子的一生。
    “同志们！”指导员低声的说：“我们都是‘穷小子’出身的！我们过去受地主的剥削和压迫，我们有冤没处伸，有苦没处诉！现在我们要报仇！要把我们的苦水吐出来。”接着是文化教员说：“先请王丑子同志把他的苦说一说。”
    高大的个子，宽宽的肩膀，有点驼背的王丑子，站在大家的面前了。二百多个眼睛盯着他。他那幅长着黑胡髭的瘦脸，变得苍白，干巴的嘴唇颤动着说不出话来。待了老大一会，指导员告诉他不要着急，他才开始了诉苦。他说着，他的声音越变得低而悲痛了。他眼里含着泪随着滴下来，掉到袄襟上。注视着他的人们，慢慢地低下了头去，指导员轻声的问“王丑子同志！你父亲叫地主打死，你疼不疼呀？”王丑子咬了咬牙没吭声。
    丑子诉苦以后，大家才知道他家是被地主弄的个家破人亡。潘金林听了王丑子的诉苦，他想起了他姐姐是和丑子的姐姐死的一样，都是被地主强占上吊死的。金林也诉了苦，并下了决心给他姐姐报仇。诉苦大会结束了，大家高呼起口号来：“我们要永远跟着共产党！”，“在毛主席的领导下，为千百万死难的父母姊妹报仇！”……
    诉苦以后，丑子才明白“革命”的意思。这天晚上，他值班看马，他守着一盏麻油灯坐着。两个胳肘抵在破皮箱上，两个手托着下巴，不知在想什么，风刮着地上的碎草，沙沙的作响，老骡子打着鼻鼾，小骡子倒蹄，打得地“啪啪！”的响着。丑子猛的站起来，走到老骡子跟前，停住了脚，低声的说：“报仇！报仇！！革命！革命！！把地主头子——把蒋介石活捉来，一刀一刀的活宰了他！”
    “喂—”潘金林见他自言自语的说的挺有劲，提着裤子走了过去？丑子转过头来问道：“接班来啦吗？”金林说：“接班还得会哩！”
    “那你怎么不睡？”丑子问。
    金林紧着裤腰带说：“老王！你的苦比我还多，咱两订个立功计划吧！你同意不？”“怎的不同意呢！你说怎么订吧？”丑子说。
    两个人订完了计划，金林接了班。丑子睡觉去了，丑子想着立功计划怎么去实行，又想到扛了三十来年的活连个媳妇也没挣上。于是他苦恼起来，他越想越难过………
    睡不着，又起来，穿好衣服，走到街上，走来走去。
    　　　　二
    晋察冀野战军，继清风店石家庄的胜利，从冀中的平原上又回到察南的山区。这给察南的光屁股的孩子们带来了温暖和愉快，老头子们也裂着嘴笑眉喜脸。他们笑着，说着“共产党没把咱们忘了！”“聂司令是知道咱们的痛苦的！！”
    在炮兵队列最前面拉第一个头号骡子的就是王丑子。丑子虽然有四十多岁了，行起军来倒是满有劲。他回头看了看潘金林，红扑扑的脸上冒出黄金的汗珠来，身子一歪一歪的紧紧的跟着，便开玩笑地说：“可小心点呀！别歪了脚呀！”金林简单的回答：“没关系！”
    金林的两只脚板虽不小，却偏在这天打了四五个大泡。他紧赶着，疼的不行，不跟上吧，立功计划上订着“保证行军不掉队”一条。于是，他忍着疼，一拐一拐的紧跟着。丑子回回头说：“怎的金林？歪了吧？”金林干脆的回答：“走你的吧！掉不了队！”
    八十里路的行军结束了，人们疲倦地躺下去。他们不是躺在暖屋子的热炕上，而是躺在察南的露天山坡上。这就是使他们永不会忘记的小雪山。大家知道，察南的气候比冀中是要冷几倍的，何况是在这半尺多厚的雪山坡上露营呢？丑子把棉被盖在骡身子，他拉上老骡子转着，他的两排牙碰的咯吱咯吱的响，骡子的蹄踏到冻硬了的雪上咕咯咕咯的。天实在冷啊，然而，钢铁的战士却胜利了一切。正如他们自己所常说的一句话：“穷人的骨头是硬的！”是的，只有他们才能为人民忍受这样的寒冷。
    难熬的一夜终于熬过了。他们盼望的太阳，从东方爬出来，他们喜欢了，他们笑着，说着、打着背包。金林打了个舒展说：“又当了一宿团长！”（冷的团着腿）丑子不客气的责备他说：“你又讲怪话啦！”
    “这叫什么怪话？这才是‘实事求是’哩！”金林骄横的说。
    “好吧！等评计划时你就知道是怪话不是怪话了！”丑子一边打着背包一边说。
    接着又是行军。丑子拉着他的伙伴——老骡子，背着两个背包（帮助别人背一个）。他紧跟在连长的后面，一边走着一边唱，他那粗拉的嗓子唱着小调子。
    察南展开了运动战，晋察冀的子弟兵走上了最前线；不怕山高和路远，不怕腿疼和腰酸。……
    走在丑子后面的金林，一拐一拐地拉开了尖声唱起练兵歌来：
    刘黑子王二旦，嗨！咱们快把技术来练，练好了技术，为人民立功上前线，嗨！上前线！……
    这当儿，出现在他们面前的是一座大山。这山倒不高，据说到顶有七里多地，丑子喊道：“要做钢铁硬汉子山顶见，要做稀泥软蛋多丢脸！”青年小伙子们都有个不落后的劲儿。谁愿做稀泥软蛋呢？大家兴奋的喊声歌声震撼了山谷，金林又拉开了他那尖嗓子唱起八路军进行曲来：
    ……向前，向前！我们的队伍象太阳，向华北的原野，向塞外的山岗——！
    一道大山过去了。一道大河又挡住了他们向前的去路。这就是察南的桑干河。河水在急流着，太阳照射在水面上，映出夺目的光来。他们在河畔，作着渡河的准备工作，一个骑兵通信员走到连长跟前说：“一个钟头以内，你连到某某村执行任务！……”
    太阳下山了，天气又冷起来，冻着冰楂的水是多么凉呀！？紧急的命令使他们不能再耽延一分钟了。王丑子拉上骡子跳下了河去，达胸深的水扎骨头的凉。他哆嗦着的手，紧紧地拉着骡子缰绳，慢慢地向前移动着。河底的石块，一滑一滑的，波浪打过了他的头顶。他倒了，急流把他冲出一丈多远去。金林一抽进了水去，抱住丑子问道：“丑子！丑子！灌了两口吧？”丑子的嘴唇抖擞着说：“没关系，没关系！”丑子拉上骡子走着，不自觉地说着：“小心！小心！”人是小心了，骡子却又躺倒水里，丑子极忙把肚带拉开，把骡子和炮身拉到岸上。

    渡过了桑干河绕过六七里路，才到达了化稍营的附近。化稍营是一个大据点，国民党暂四军的两个团住在那里。任务是：要干净的把这两上团吃掉。所以，炮兵的责任就大了，这就是说，吃掉这两团的时间大小，就要决定在炮兵能否压倒敌人的火力。
    在黑暗中，炮火连天，到处是火光，到处是枪弹，说不定要碰一颗子弹的。王丑子在这枪林弹雨中，担负着重要的任务，他一夜没得睡，两天没吃饭了，他的嘴唇上起了好几个火炮，汗，湿透了棉袄。一夜过去了，红日升起来，丑子扛着三发炮弹跑在运输队的前面，他回回头向大家喊道：“快！快！”别人都弯着腰迅速的跑过来，他们在交通壕的拐弯处休息着。丑子伏在壕边上，观察着碉堡上的枪眼，不时的打出清脆的枪来，他看好了地形，向大家说道：“同志们！这离炮阵地还有六十多公尺，一上沟就是三十多公尺的封锁地带，咱们分成小组通过！”他说完就跑上沟去，他回头看看有几个人傻的直着腰跑，他高声的喊着“匍匐前进！”金林跟在他后面，刚爬出十来公尺去，就挂花了。丑子听他“哇！”的叫了一声，见金林不动了，就跑过来抱上他往沟里跑。他跑着，一枪正打中他的右腿，他说了个：“我日你奶奶！”急忙跑进沟去。
    “金林！金林！打那儿啦？”丑子亲切的问。
    “不要紧，打胳膊了！”金林回答。
    丑子取出救济包来，给潘金林绑扎好说：“你休息休息吧！不要出去！”可是他自己的大腿还流着鲜血。他用一块破裤片子把腿缠好，又去执行他的任务了。他忍着大腿的疼向前爬进，五发炮弹，在他那两只干巴手的指挥下向前梭着。他的任务完成了，报告给排长，排长派张凤友背他回去。丑子和蔼地说：“不用管我！我自己回去了！”张凤友要坚持背他，他坚决的拒绝了。张凤友没办法，便说：“这是排长的命令！”丑子笑了笑说：“这个命令你不要执行！以后有我负责！”张凤友用“命令”两个字并没达到目的，他找不出个办法来。丑子又说：“你还有任务哩！”他说完就走了。
    第二次丑子又扛起三发炮弹来，副连长制止他，不让他再送了。他拒绝地说：“副连长！我不执行你这个命令，‘轻花不下火线’这是我的计划，我要执行我的计划！”副连长没法制止他了。金林见比他挂花还重的老王这样，他也扛起三发炮弹来说：“老王！今个就是为人民立功的机会！！”
    战斗结束了，民主大会上第一个提出立功的就是王丑子。第二个是潘金林。他们两个立了功，全连的同志们对他俩更尊敬了。并给他两个赠了一个称号，叫王丑子“老英雄”，叫潘金林“小英雄”。他们高兴起来，但是他们还很谦虚地说：“这是大家的功劳！要不是大家的帮助怎么也立不了功！”
    王丑子立了功以后，各班都提出“向老英雄学习”的口号来。这可使王丑子发了愁，他说：“咱，斗大的字不识，向咱学个啥？！”话是这么说，可是他心里也有些高兴。他的谦逊，他的进步使全连没一个不佩服的。
    有一天，支部里召开了一个大会，大会是“自报公议”的吸收党员。第一个报名的就是王丑子，他把自己入党的条件说了后，又说了自己入党的志愿，他说：“我愿意跟着共产党一辈子，共产党就是我的家，共产党是我的恩人！我要坚决的在党的领导下为人民服务！！我过去还有老些缺点，有一次，我对革命认识不清，想跳井死了，后来我想了想，我要死了就不能报仇了，才没跳了井！”他说完之后，大家展开了对他的评条件。最后潘金林发表了个意见，他说：“王丑子入党我倒同意，就是他还有个自私的思想，他值班喂牲口时，先上他那骡槽搁料，这个可得克服……”大家都一致同意他入党了。
    表已经送十来天了，还没批下来，王丑子心里有些愁闷了。这天没有行军，别人都在洗衣服、缝鞋子、他却坐在太阳地里愁眉不展，他坐着，两条腿叉开，手里拿着棍扰划着。他想“怎么还没批准我呢？条件不够吗？”他又想到金林给他提的意见，他猛的站起来，走进屋去，躺在坑上睡了。副班长从连部里回来，见王丑子睡了喊道：“老王！”丑子坐起来不吭声。
    “不痛快吗？”副班长问。
    “痛快！”丑子没的回答，便随便的说。
    “咱们编在一个小组啦！”副班长说。
    “批准啦吗？”丑子紧张的问。
    “嗯：五个月的候补期！”副班长说。
    王丑子入了党，他自己欢喜、高兴、光荣，别人也觉得光荣高兴，大家吸着香烟，剥着花生，给丑子过新生日。金林呢？听说丑子入了党，他也欢喜的不行，而且从思想里尊重了他。
    　　　　四
    有一天，晚上，人们正在酣睡着，连部里通信员来传紧急集合。十分钟后，部队开始出发了。
    第一阵地上的任务完成了，接着又转移第二阵地。七八个人推着数千斤重的大炮，在泥泞里飞驰，泥浆飞起来落在王丑子的身上、脸上。丑子喊起来，他喊着“完成任务立战功！”“争取全班立功！”大家迅速的通过了封锁线。第二阵地距敌也不过三百公尺，打出的炮弹发发命中，丑子高兴的跳起来高喊“报……”不幸，他倒下去了。潘金林喊了个“不好了！”猛的把丑子抱起来，看了看丑子的那幅惨白的面孔，不觉的流下了眼泪，他喊着：“丑子！丑子！”丑子慢慢睁开了眼说：“报仇！”潘金林把丑子的尸体放下，又继续执行他的任务。
    战斗结束了，全连的指战员立正站着致默哀。指导员看过王丑子的伤口后沉痛地说：“王丑子同志！你光荣的牺牲了，你的牺牲，使我们失去了一个坚决顽强的战友！亲爱的伙伴！你的血仇由我们替你来报。我代表营党委会，宣布追认王丑子同志为中国共产党正式党员！”
