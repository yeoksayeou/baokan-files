　　Bankrupt Southwest Industry and Mining
    Zhu Ping
    Luo Guangwen, a self-proclaimed "roughneck" and pseudo-commander, once said to Chongqing's industrial and commercial figures: "The war was lost by the military, due to the collapse of politics. The reason for the political collapse is the result of economic collapse." Regardless of how inverted his statement is, it reflects a fact: the Kuomintang's remnant reactionary forces' exploitative policies have caused the economy in their controlled areas to collapse. The current situation in the Southwest is precisely that.
    (I)
    Sichuan, once known as the "Land of Abundance," is now completely bankrupt in its rural areas. Tenant farmers must pay landlords 56% to 81% of their main crops as rent each year. Sichuan has 84 million mu of arable land. Due to the dispersion of able-bodied men, no less than 6.7 million men have been "conscripted," seized, and arrested by the pseudo-"Central Government" over the years (this number is equivalent to two-tenths of the total number of farmers in Sichuan). That is to say, the most productive middle-aged and young people in rural areas have been conscripted. In 1948 and 1949, as the reactionary regime's territory gradually shrank, Sichuan became its main target for exploitation. With no more "able-bodied" men to seize in the rural areas, they lowered their standards and victimized the "young." Looking at the pseudo-"Central Army," local armies, or private armies established in Sichuan and throughout the Southwest, they were all children aged thirteen or fourteen, even eleven or twelve, who could barely lift a gun. Rural labor productivity was greatly reduced, and the rural areas were completely bankrupt. At this time, a few wealthy officials and gentry poured their blood-soaked wealth, squeezed from the people, into land. In areas such as Guanxian and Huayang in the Chengdu Plain, Wanxian and Fuling in eastern Sichuan, and Luzhou and Yibin in southern Sichuan, many poor, middle, and even rich peasants and small landlords went bankrupt, while the land holdings of large landlords reached tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of mu.
    The economic lives of people in rural markets and urban citizens were also exhausted under the reactionary government's heavy taxes and levies, coupled with the bone-scraping currency "reform." Following the complete bankruptcy of the "Legal Tender" and "Gold Yuan," the old but not dead Yan Xishan introduced a set of "Silver Yuan Certificates." Although it was said to be exchanged for silver dollars at a one-to-one ratio, less than half a month after the issuance order on July 3rd, the market ratio of Silver Yuan Certificates to silver dollars had become one to seventy-five. One Silver Yuan Certificate was only worth seventy-five cents of a silver dollar. The silver dollar itself was also depreciating rapidly: the price range of gold in mid-June was 33 to 40 yuan, rising to 92 yuan by July 16th; the price range of 20-count green Flying Shuttle cotton yarn in mid-June was 1 to 2 yuan, rising to 9 yuan by July 16th; the price range of cooked upland rice in mid-June was around 2 yuan, rising to 9.2 yuan on July 16th. In one month, the price of gold rose one and a half times, fine yarn rose four and a half times, and rice rose four times.
    (II)
    "What do we need industry and mining for? Cars aren't as good as foreign ones, we can't build airplanes, and foreign machines are also more sophisticated." That is how the comprador class – the running dogs of the foreign masters – announced their policy guidelines. When the Anti-Japanese War began in 1937, factories in the coastal and river provinces with convenient transportation moved inland one after another. At that time, a total of 443 factories moved inland, including 135 from Shanghai, 37 from Hubei, 16 from Henan, 11 from Nanjing, 11 from Hunan, 7 from Jiangsu, and the rest from Shanxi, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Hebei, Qingdao, Tianjin, and other places. 245 factories moved to Sichuan, 142 to Hunan and Guangxi, 42 to Shaanxi, and 14 to other provinces. Among them were 182 machine factories, 25 electrical equipment factories, 40 chemical factories, 94 textile factories, and the rest were food, educational supplies, and mining, etc. After Japan surrendered, American airplanes, artillery, clothing, food, and even toilet paper were shipped over on Liberty ships, and the Chinese land became a market for American goods. As a result, some factories and mines became victims of American goods and the reactionary regime's speculative market; a small number of factory and mine owners attempted to maintain the survival of their factories and mines through speculation. Of course, this attempt was impossible to achieve. The natural trend of industry and mining in the reactionary government's territory was to shut down and suspend operations altogether.
    Southwest's important industries are divided into 45 categories: electrical industry, electrical equipment, machinery industry, iron and steel metallurgy, metal casting, non-ferrous metal rolling, shipbuilding, motor vehicles, hardware manufacturing, nail making, needle making, flour, rice milling, printing, instruments and stationery, paper industry, medical equipment manufacturing, leather making, salt and sugar, match industry, rubber industry, cement industry, dyes, vegetable oil refining, alcohol, pharmaceuticals, soap, paint, glass, chemical raw materials, silk, silk weaving, cotton spinning, wool spinning, towel blankets, knitting industry, dyeing and weaving, pig bristle brushes, pottery industry, brick and tile industry, lumber, coal mines, cigarettes, food, military industry, etc. Except for the military industry, most of the rest are national capital, totaling more than 1,600 large and small factories and mines. There are also more than 2,000 handicraft (including family industry) workshops, which can be divided into more than 30 categories such as native cloth, weaving, embroidery, woodwork, and bamboo work. There are 200,000 technicians in the military industry and 120,000 industrial workers in national industries. Judging from the classification of industries, Southwest industry already has some foundation. For example, Yu Xin Iron and Steel Plant's engineer Zhong Shizhao's aluminothermic method of smelting tungsten iron is a very valuable discovery in the world, but the reactionary government looks down on yellow-faced engineers and still sells tungsten ore to the United States, Britain, and France, and then buys back tungsten iron from the United States. Another example is the high-grade steel used in the military industry. The responsible engineers of the domestic steel industry are certain that they can produce it themselves, but it requires an investment first, which the Chiang regime stubbornly refuses. Other machines, vehicles, and engines could have been produced domestically, but the Chiang regime was afraid of losing comprador benefits and stubbornly refused to allow the country's national industries to produce them. As a result, many factories had no work. Many overseas Chinese engineers with reputations in European and American factories returned to the country driven by patriotism, wanting to serve the motherland, but because they had no work, some were forced to become vagrants, some committed suicide by drowning, and some hanged themselves in toilets. As a result, Chongqing factories stopped production or reduced production, Chengdu markets had no transactions, Kunming industry was sluggish, Leshan industry was precarious, Zigong salt fields were withered, Yibin industry was desolate, Minjiang coal mines collapsed, and Tianfu coal mine employees took general leave...
    In order to further understand the industrial crisis in the Southwest, we will now analyze a statistical material. In June 1949, the Kuomintang pseudo-"Central Government" divided the important industries in the Chongqing area (i.e., the Southwest area) into 18 categories, with the following number of factories and employees: Machinery (including steel) industry had 140 factories and 7,000 employees; machine cotton textile had 10 factories and 17,700 employees; leather industry had 250 factories and 1,500 employees; soap industry had 40 factories and 1,200 employees; pharmaceutical industry had 28 factories and 1,300 employees; flour industry had 26 factories and 1,495 employees; silk reeling industry had 36 factories and 12,762 employees; knitting industry had 72 factories and 6,420 employees; wool textile had 3 factories and 1,512 employees; electrical equipment industry had 21 factories and 1,400 employees; rice milling industry had 208 factories and 6,000 employees; construction industry had 104 factories and 10,556 employees; printing industry had 22 factories and 3,500 employees; electrical industry had 14 factories and 6,354 employees; match industry had 14 factories and 3,000 employees; coal mining industry had 105 factories and 22,900 employees; alcohol industry had 10 factories and 1,100 employees; paper industry had 10 factories and 4,200 employees. Comparing this statistic with the 1947 industrial and mining statistics: (1) In 1947, the coal mining industry had 98 member factories with a total of 76,000 employees. In 1949, the number of members increased slightly, but the number of employees was sharply reduced by two-thirds. (2) The number of leather industry members decreased from 343 in 1947 to 250. (3) The number of machinery industry members decreased from 226 to 140. (4) The number of machine cotton textile industry members decreased from 20 to 10. (5) The number of printing industry members sharply decreased from 85 to 22. (6) The number of knitting industry members decreased from 141 to 72. (7) The number of alcohol industry members decreased from 12 to 10. (8) The number of pharmaceutical industry members decreased from 30 to 28. (9) The number of match industry members decreased from 15 to 14. Judging from this statistical comparison alone, the existing industry and mining in the Southwest is less than one-third of what it was during the Anti-Japanese War, and only one-half compared to 1947. Moreover, the factories and mines exist in name only, the number of employees has sharply decreased, and the scope of business has been reduced to "running speculation" or maintaining food.
    (III)
    Under the rule of the Chiang regime, the Southwest national industry has completely lost hope of survival. As a result, national industrialists turned their attention to the Liberated Areas, eagerly hoping to obtain the Communist Party's industrial policies and the People's Government's regulations and rules for the management of private industries. Some enthusiastic and young engineers left the Chiang-controlled areas of the Southwest alone and came to the Liberated Areas, finding a new way out.
    Finally, I will write down the demands and hopes of the national bourgeoisie in the Southwest:
    (1) Politics: They need politics that serve the people. They demand that the People's Government protect national industry, restrict the import of foreign goods, and refuse to approve the import of any foreign goods that can be manufactured domestically, no matter how exquisite the foreign goods are. As for machinery and equipment used in industry, those that can increase production and increase employment opportunities should be encouraged for import. (2) Develop transportation and facilitate transportation. (3) Revive the countryside and fully supply raw materials. (4) Prosper the economy and stabilize prices. (5) Improve technology and implement scientific management. (6) Strengthen the links between various industries. (7) Plan to manufacture machines themselves. (8) Rationalize wages. (9) Industrial loans. (10) Academic research institutions and industry should maintain close contact.

　　破产了的西南工矿业
    祝平
    自命为老粗的一个伪编练司令罗广文有一次对重庆市工商界人士说：“仗是军人打败的，那是因为政治垮杆的缘故，政治所以要垮，实是经济崩溃了的结果。”不管他说的如何颠倒，却反映了一个事实，即国民党残余反动力量的剥削政策已使它统治的区域经济上垮杆了，现在的西南正是如此。
    （一）
    四川过去所称“天府之国”，现在，农村是彻头彻尾破产了。佃农对地主每年要缴纳主要作物的百分之五十六至百分之八十一的地租。四川的耕地面积有八千四百万亩。由于壮丁离散，连年被伪“中央政府”“征”去、抓去、逮捕去的壮丁不下六百七十万人（这个数目相当四川农民总数的十分之二），即是说：农村中最富生产能力的中年青年人都被征去了。至三十七、三十八两年度，反动政权在其统治区日渐缩小之后，四川遂变成它盘剥的主要对象。农村中已无“壮”丁可抓，于是降格以求，殃及“幼”丁。就四川以至整个西南成立起来的伪“中央军”、地方军或私家军看来，都是些十三四岁以至十一二岁的小孩子，枪都提不起来。农村劳动生产力大大降低，农村完全破产。这时，少数达官豪门又纷纷将他们剥削人民的血汗脂膏投向土地。成都盆地灌县、华阳一带，川东万县、涪陵一带，川南泸州、宜宾一带，许多贫农、中农，乃至富农、小地主都破了产，大地主的田地却达到了数万亩乃至数十万亩。
    乡场和都市市民阶层的经济生活，在反动政府的重税重捐搜括下，加上敲骨吸髓的货币“改革”，生活也都山穷水尽了。继“法币”、“金元”完全破产之后，老而不死的阎锡山又来了一套“银元券”。说是一对一兑换银元，但从七月三日发行的命令开始，不到半个月，银元券对银元的市场比率已成了一比七五。银元券一元只值银元的七角五。银元本身也在飞速贬值：六月中的黄金价格幅度为三十三元至四十元，至七月十六日升为九十二元，二十支绿飞艇棉纱六月中的价格幅度为一元至二元，至七月十六日上升至九元，上山熟稻米六月中的价格幅度在二元左右，七月十六日升至九元二角。一月内黄金上升一倍半，细纱上升四倍半，食米上升四倍。
    （二）
    “工矿业要它做什么？汽车没有外国的好，飞机不会造，机器也是外国的精。”买办阶级—洋大人的走狗就是这样宣布他们的施政方针的。二十六年抗日战争开始，二十七八年沿海沿江各交通便利省份的工厂纷纷内迁，当时内迁工厂共计四四三家，计由上海迁来者一三五家，湖北迁来者三七家，河南十六家，南京十一家，湖南十一家，江苏七家，其余为晋、赣、浙、冀、青、津等地所迁来。迁到四川者二四五厂，湘桂一四二厂，陕西四二厂，其他省区十四厂。其中机器厂一八二，电工器材厂二五，化学厂四○，纺织厂九四，其余为食品、教育用品、矿业等。日本投降后，美国的飞机、大炮、衣物、食粮、大便纸都用自由轮载来了，华夏国土尽成美货市场。于是，一部分厂矿，成了美货和反动政权投机市场的牺牲者；一小部分厂矿主曾企图以投机来维持工厂矿山的生存。当然，这种企图是不可能实现的，反动政府领域内的工矿业很自然的趋势是整个关厂停工。
    西南重要工业详细划分共计四十五类：电气工业、电工器材、机器业、钢铁冶制、金属铸造、非铁金属轧制、造船业、机动车、五金制造、制钉、制针、面粉、碾米、印刷、仪器文具、造纸业、医疗器械制造、制革、盐糖、火柴工业、橡胶业、水泥业、染料、植物油炼制、酒精、制药、肥皂、油漆、玻璃、化学原料、蚕丝、丝织、棉纺织、毛纺织、毛巾被毯、针织工业、染织、猪鬃制刷、陶器工业、砖瓦工业、锯木、煤矿、卷烟、食品、兵工业等，其中除了兵工业外，其余大部为民族资本，总计大小工厂矿山共一千六百余家。手工业（家庭工业在内）工场也有二千多家，可以分为土布、编织、刺绣、木作、竹作等三十余类。兵工业技工有二十万人，民族工业产业工人有十二万人。就工业之分类看，西南工业已有若干基础。如渝鑫钢铁厂钟士钊工程师以铝热法炼钨铁，是世界上非常有价值的发现，但反动政府看不起黄面孔的工程师，仍然把钨砂卖给美、英、法等国，再向美国买回钨铁。又如兵工业所用的高级钢，本国的钢铁工业负责工程师肯定的说可自己生产，但必须先有一笔投资，蒋政权坚持不肯。其他机器、车辆、发动机本来国内可以生产，但蒋政权害怕损失买办利益，死也不肯让本国的民族工业生产。于是，许多工厂就没有了工作。不少在欧美工厂有声誉的华侨工程师，在爱国心趋使下回国，要为祖国服务，但因没有事作，有的被迫流浪，有的投江自杀，有的在厕所里上吊。于是重庆工厂停工减产，成都市场无交易，昆明工业不景气，乐山工业风雨飘摇，自贡盐场凋蔽了，宜宾工业萧条了，岷江煤矿崩溃了，天府煤矿员工总请假了，长寿电厂停工了……。
    为了对西南工业危机作更进一步的了解，我们现在分析一个统计材料。三十八年六月国民党伪“中央政府”将重庆区（即西南区）重要工业划分为十八类，其厂数职工数如下：机器（包括钢铁）业有一百四十厂，职工七千人，机器棉纺织十厂，职工一万七千七百人，制革业二百五十厂，职工一千五百人，肥皂业四十厂，职工一千二百人，制药业二十八厂，职工一千三百人，面粉业二十六厂，职工一千四百九十五人，缫丝业三十六厂，职工一万二千七百六十二人，针织业七十二厂，职工六千四百二十人，毛纺织三厂，职工一千五百十二人，电工器材业二十一厂，职工一千四百人，碾米业二百零八厂，职工六千人，营造业一百零四厂，职工一万零五百五十六人，印刷业二十二厂，职工三千五百人，电气业十四厂，职工六千三百五十四人，火柴业十四厂，职工三千人，煤矿业一百零五厂，职工二万二千九百人，酒精业十厂，职工一千一百人，造纸业十厂，职工四千二百人。就这个统计与三十六年度工矿业统计比较：（一）三十六年度煤矿业有会员厂九十八家，职工总数为七万六千人，三十八年会员数略有增加，但雇佣职工数却锐减三分之二。（二）制革业会员由三十六年的三百四十三家减为二百五十家。（三）机器业会员由二百二十六家减至一百四十家。（四）机器棉纺业会员厂由二十家减至十家。（五）印刷工业会员厂由八十五家锐减至二十二家。（六）针织业会员厂由一百四十一家减至七十二家。（七）酒精业由十二家减至十家。（八）制药业由三十家减至二十八家。（九）火柴业由十五家减至十四家。单就这个统计比较看，西南现存工矿业已不及抗战期中的三分之一，与三十六年相比也只有二分之一。而且各工厂矿山名存实停，职工人数锐减，业务范围已经紧缩到“跑头寸”或维持伙食。
    （三）
    西南民族工业在蒋政权统治下，完全消灭了生存的希望。于是民族工业家便把自己的眼光转向解放区，他们热望得到共产党的工业政策和人民政府的民营工业管理法规、章程一类的文件和消息，有些热情而年青的工程师便只身离开西南蒋管区，来到解放区，找到了新出路。
    最后，我把西南区民族资产阶级的要求和希望写下来：
    （一）政治，服务于人民的政治他们是需要的。他们要求人民政府保护民族工业，限制外货输入，凡本国能制造的，不论外货如何精美，不予核准进口。至于工业用的机器设备，可用以增加生产，又可增多就业机会者，应鼓励进口。（二）发展交通，便利运输。（三）复兴农村，充分供应原料。（四）繁荣经济，稳定物价。（五）改进技术，励行科学管理。（六）加强各业联系。（七）筹划自造机器。（八）工资合理化。（九）工业贷款。（十）学术研究机关和工业取得密切联系。
