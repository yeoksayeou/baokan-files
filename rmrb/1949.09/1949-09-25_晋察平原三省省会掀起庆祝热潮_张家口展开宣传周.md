Zhangjiakou Launches Publicity Week

[Reported from Zhangjiakou on the 23rd] Upon hearing the news of the opening of the People's Political Consultative Conference, all circles in Zhangjiakou have been celebrating wildly for days. The city's major streets and alleys, and the entrances of various businesses, are adorned with red flags, colorful banners, slogans, and paper couplets, creating a vibrant scene. Nineteen organizations and units from the Party, government, military, and civilian sectors of Chahar Province and Zhangjiakou City, representing the four million people of the province, sent a telegram of congratulations. Many organizations, troops, and schools dispatched publicity trucks, playing military music, beating gongs and drums, and setting off firecrackers, twisting and singing as they paraded and propagandized to the citizens, shouting slogans such as "Celebrate the opening of the People's Political Consultative Conference!" "Celebrate the birth of the People's Republic of China!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Sino-Soviet Friendship!" The next morning, many more departments and units turned out, carrying red flags and giant portraits of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu for celebratory parades. The Zhangjiakou Municipal People's Government and the Cultural Center have jointly formed a propaganda team, which has launched a People's Political Consultative Conference publicity week, effective immediately. The Cultural Center and its branches are holding publicity lectures in various theaters.

Wang Ping, Commander of the Chahar Military Region, Sun Ming, Director of the Chahar Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, Wang Jixin, Vice President of the Zhangjiakou Branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, Yang Gan, Director of the Zhangjiakou Railway Branch Bureau Trade Union, Shi Guozhen, Director of the Zhangjiakou Women's Federation, Yu Dehai, a member of the Zhangjiakou Hui Muslim Association, representatives of the Second Preparatory Committee of the Zhangjiakou All-Circles Representative Conference, and Sun Yin Fan, a representative of the fur industry, all made speeches, unanimously expressing their support for the People's Political Consultative Conference and the Central People's Government it elected, and pledging to thoroughly implement all its resolutions. Workers at the Zhangyuan Machine Factory, which has three hundred machines, held a forum and unanimously expressed their determination to produce more machine tools and strive for the realization of the industrialized new Chahar. Many workers said: "We must learn from the brave and steadfast example of Soviet workers, relying on our own efforts, overcoming difficulties, and actively producing to shatter the imperialist blockade." When the Mongolian and Hui people saw the names of their ethnic representatives on the list of CPPCC representatives, they were overjoyed. Gongbuzhapu, a Mongolian, said: "The convening of the People's Political Consultative Conference is of great benefit to the Mongolian people. From now on, the Mongolian people can also co-manage national affairs on an equal footing with other fraternal ethnic groups. If it were not for the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we Mongolian people would not know how many years we would be oppressed by the Kuomintang reactionaries!"

[New Xiang, 23rd Dispatch] The news of the opening of the People's Political Consultative Conference caused a sensation throughout Xinxiang City. The Pingyuan Daily published it in red on the 22nd. A newsboy who usually sells newspapers for a whole day sold out in half an hour that day. Comrades from the newspaper's telegraph department made a guarantee to avoid incorrect or missing characters, in order to improve their work and celebrate this grand event. Ma Wenqing and other workers from the Pingyuan Machine Factory happily said after seeing the newspaper: "This CPPCC is unprecedented in history, with the people of the whole country united under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao... a new People's Republic of China is about to be born. Our working class is the leading class in the country, and in the future, we should adopt the attitude of masters of the country, double our production, and build our country."

[Taiyuan, 23rd Dispatch] After the news of the opening of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference reached Taiyuan, people flocked to places with radios like a tide. When the radio station on Qiaotou Street broadcast Chairman Mao's opening speech, enthusiastic applause erupted every two or three minutes, and many listeners also excitedly applauded. Starting on the 22nd, the People's Political Consultative Conference became everyone's most interesting topic of discussion. Workers, farmers staying in farmer reception centers, and People's Liberation Army soldiers all expressed: Our good days are more secure, and we must work harder. Secondary schools in Taiyuan City also used their spare time to perform Yangko dances on the streets for publicity to show their celebration.
