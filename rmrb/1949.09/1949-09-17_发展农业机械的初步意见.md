　　Preliminary Opinions on Developing Agricultural Machinery
　　Sun Jinglu, Director of the General Factory of North China Agricultural Machinery Plant

　　With the victory of the People's Liberation War, people's cities in various places have entered peaceful construction. The arsenals and repair shops used by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to manufacture weapons for slaughtering the people are gradually being transformed into agricultural machinery manufacturing industries that truly serve the farmers. According to statistics from Peiping alone, the Second Repair Shop of the Pseudo-Suppression General Headquarters Military Control Commission has been converted into the North China Agricultural Machinery General Plant, and has already produced more than two hundred agricultural machines. The remaining six repair shops have also begun to shift to agricultural machinery production. The development of agricultural machinery manufacturing is one of the most important factors in consolidating and developing the New Democratic agriculture. It will play a significant role in the future development of the rural economy, in rapidly healing the wounds of war, and in enabling the country to obtain inexhaustible and inexhaustible rich products and raw materials. Socialist countries, such as the Soviet Union, and other New Democratic countries attach great importance to the development of agricultural machinery. The Soviet Lupo Car Factory manufactured thousands of landmines during the war. After Germany surrendered in 1945, peacetime production began immediately. In three months, the factory manufactured 2,000 mowing machines and 1,292 harvesting machines. In the last three months of 1945, the factory manufactured another 6,400 mowing machines and 4,300 harvesting machines. According to statistics from the Soviet Pravda on September 27, 1945, compared with the first three "wartime" months of the same year, the production of agricultural machinery increased fivefold for tractors in the three months before and after 1945. Tractor-pulled seed drills increased 16 times. Animal-powered seed drills increased 17 times, combine harvesters increased 18 times, and tractor-pulled cultivators increased as much as 30 times. In Czechoslovakia, in the post-war production plan for 1947, 234,728 agricultural machines were completed in the first quarter, with actual production reaching 282,541 units, exceeding the original plan by 21.2 percent. The Soviet people call the agricultural machinery manufacturing industry the child of the Soviet regime. Facts speak louder than words, and only socialist and New Democratic countries led by the Communist Party can rapidly transform wartime industry into agricultural machinery manufacturing that truly serves the people.

　　Currently, developing agricultural machinery in China is a new issue for us. What to manufacture? What do farmers need? How to promote it? These are all questions that need to be studied. To this end, since its establishment, the North China Agricultural Machinery General Plant has organized propaganda teams to carry new agricultural implements to the countryside for trials and to listen to the opinions of the masses. At the same time, it has contacted state-owned farms to conduct various agricultural machinery trials, and collected relevant agricultural implement survey materials from various places for research. According to our preliminary understanding, farmers feel most deeply threatened by drought, so they first hope to solve the problem of farmland water conservancy. In the North China region, according to statistics from August 1946, there are approximately 200 million mu of cultivated land (paddy fields accounting for approximately 10 percent) and a population of approximately 60 million, making it an important agricultural area. Due to geographical conditions and the underdeveloped state of afforestation and water conservancy projects, there is a saying of "drought nine years out of ten". In other areas, there is "spring drought and summer flood", so the research and manufacture of irrigation or drainage machinery is a top priority. The agricultural machinery manufacturing industry should solve this problem gradually in a planned and step-by-step manner. In addition to developing water conservancy projects such as afforestation, water storage, flood prevention, canal excavation, and well digging, animal-powered waterwheels still need to be developed in large quantities in the next few years. Because animal power is still the most common source of power used in rural areas, and farmers are relatively familiar with the technology of using waterwheels. Also, according to our recent records of experiments with pig iron buckets and pipe waterwheels near Peiping, the lowest efficiency is 35 percent, and the highest is only 48.5 percent. Some waterwheels have efficiencies as low as 20 to 30 percent due to poor design or damage and leakage. Therefore, we believe that it is very necessary to design and manufacture two or three types of high-efficiency waterwheels. Next year, the Agricultural Department of the North China People's Government plans to manufacture 80,000 waterwheels to irrigate 2 million mu of dry land. Comparing the use of high-efficiency waterwheels with the use of low-efficiency waterwheels, if the same amount of water is obtained, the manufacture of better waterwheels, assuming an average increase in efficiency of 10 percent, would save the labor and materials for 10,000 waterwheels, equivalent to approximately 10 million jin of millet. For pig iron alone, 2,400 tons can be saved. Therefore, agricultural machinery workers should currently research and design a new type of waterwheel with higher efficiency, preparing it for mass production in the next few years. As for the future goal, taking irrigation machinery with centrifugal pumps as a target is still appropriate. According to the 15-horsepower electric water pump designed by the North China Agricultural Machinery General Plant, if 100,000 pumps are manufactured in conjunction with well digging or the utilization of rivers, the irrigation problem for more than half of the cultivated land in North China can be solved. However, water pumps have high speeds and require greater power, which requires us to study agricultural power issues based on our specific conditions, such as steam engines, internal combustion engines, electric rollers, etc. Among them, the utilization of wind power and water power each have regional characteristics. For example, windmills can be greatly utilized along the coast, and areas with rivers or waterfalls should make full use of their water level differences to install water turbines and develop hydropower generation in a planned manner, which is a very necessary long-term construction plan. According to our understanding, electricity is the cheapest among other power sources. If power companies can supply electricity for farmland water use under the condition that it does not hinder lighting and factory electricity use, it would promote electric irrigation areas in a planned manner. If a pilot project is successful, then agricultural electric motors will also need to be manufactured in large quantities.

　　Steam engines have lower efficiency, but they are simple to use and less prone to failure. It seems that they can still be widely used in coal-producing areas. It is better to manufacture small and easy-to-move steam engines. Internal combustion engines can be divided into gas engines, gasoline engines, and diesel engines according to the fuel they use. Because our country's production of liquid fuel is not abundant, gas engines that use coal, firewood, or charcoal as fuel are more suitable than those that use oil. Although they are twice as expensive as using electricity, they are half as expensive as using diesel and two-thirds as expensive as using gasoline. Therefore, we should currently concentrate our efforts on researching and manufacturing agricultural gas engines. This is an important matter in solving the problem of agricultural power. Recently, someone suggested that a small one or two horsepower power source could try to build a hot air engine. Although the efficiency is low, the manufacture and use are very simple, and fuels such as firewood and dry grass are easy to obtain in rural areas, so it is also quite valuable to research and manufacture.

　　Solving the problem of farmland water conservancy. On the one hand, a large number of waterwheels need to be manufactured to meet the urgent needs of the next few years. At the same time, new-style mechanical irrigation should be developed in a planned manner. At present, under the circumstances that machine industries in various places are oriented towards the countryside and turning to agricultural machinery manufacturing, planned production and division of labor should be adopted. Larger-scale agricultural machinery factories, such as the North China Agricultural Machinery Plant and the Shanghai China Agricultural Company, can focus on research and leadership and focus on what general small factories cannot manufacture. For example, water pumps, power engines, and new agricultural machines that are highly efficient and suitable for rural irrigation. Smaller-scale factories or private iron factories can focus their efforts on mass production of waterwheels and simple agricultural tools generally used in rural areas. Such a division of labor will be very effective in terms of factory management, saving labor and materials, and reducing costs. It is better than thinking about making everything, but making everything poorly. According to our understanding, some factories start to think about making advanced agricultural machinery such as tractors as soon as they switch industries. This idea is harmful. At present, the first thing is to solve the most urgent problems for farmers, start from the needs of farmers, gradually improve in a planned manner according to agricultural conditions, and it is not a problem for a large number of tractors to gallop across the fields of New China in the course of continuous development in the future.

　　Secondly, there is the issue of manufacturing general agricultural machinery, such as plowing, sowing, fertilizing, cultivating, thinning seedlings, weeding, preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests, harvesting, sorting, and processing. Due to the war and other reasons, agricultural tools have suffered losses. In addition, the area of cultivated land is increasing day by day during the period of peaceful construction, and farmers' enthusiasm for production is increasing day by day, requiring a large number of manufactured supplements. Our opinion is that small iron factories in towns and rural blacksmith shops should intensify the manufacture of simple agricultural tools according to the needs of the masses, and larger-scale machine factories or converted munitions factories should conduct precise research, experiments, and design and manufacture new-type horse-drawn plows, seeders (or seeding and fertilizing machines), weeders, seedling thinning machines, sprayers, powder sprayers, harvesters, threshers, sorters, cotton gins, oil presses, flour mills, rice hullers, etc. under the principle of improving production efficiency, in order to gradually replace old-fashioned plows, hoes, drills, sickles, hoes, winnowers, etc., so that farmers can become familiar with the use of new agricultural tools, greatly save labor, not miss the farming season, and improve production efficiency by one step. For example, animal-powered liberation-style weeders can weed an average of more than 25 mu of land per day, which is both fast and good. And ordinary farmers need to spend five or sixty days a year using hoes to loosen soil and weed. A diligent farmer can only hoe one or two mu of land per day. After the North China Agricultural Machinery General Plant went to the masses for experiments, the farmers welcomed the liberation-style weeder very much, and we should mass-produce it according to the opinions of the masses. For example, the basic agricultural tool used by farmers: the horse-drawn plow, although there are many types of plows in various places, there has been very little improvement in thousands of years. Some are bulky and laborious, or have poor plowing, affecting crop growth conditions, or the structure and materials are not strong and durable, and need to be carefully checked and compared in experiments. The North China Agricultural Machinery General Plant is now collecting various different plows (including domestic, Soviet, American, and Japanese), carefully testing and comparing them, and preparing to design standard plows suitable for soil quality in various parts of our country for mass production.

　　In the manufacture of these general agricultural machines, we believe that two issues should be noted: 1. It is necessary to create new-style agricultural tools that are applicable to our country. But everything must start from the reality base, and consider our country's agricultural conditions in detail. Consider the economic value of the creations, the manufacturing cost, and the basis of scientific theory. It is useless to only pursue novelty or fantasy inventions or to completely copy foreign styles. The most important thing is to adopt the principles of new-style agricultural machinery that have significant effects in various countries, and then refer to agricultural conditions in various parts of China, consider the gains and losses, design and manufacture, and conduct thorough experiments in the factory after they are made. If there are any problems, improve them from scratch, and then mass-produce them after they are confirmed to be applicable. Also, if a certain agricultural tool is used with good results in a certain place in the country, it can be introduced to another place for testing. If it is equally easy to use, technical exchanges can be expanded and imitated and promoted in the latter location. 2. When an agricultural machine is truly successful, the amount needed by farmers will be large, which is by no means something that one, two, or even a few factories can supply. In order to achieve the goal of corresponding supply and demand, we advocate that the government or research institutions, or the Agricultural Machinery General Plant, should formulate various standard agricultural machinery dimensions and specifications, and assign quotas to each factory in an organized and planned manner to promote specialization in each factory. Some factories even specialize in making parts, and some factories specialize in assembly. Adopt mass production methods as much as possible to reduce production costs. At the same time, the government should set up an inspection agency to inspect those that are unqualified and not accept or allow them to be sold. Otherwise, if a few factories or most factories blindly produce shoddy goods, they will lose the trust of the farmers. This will not only not help the development of new-style agricultural machinery, but will be harmful.

　　In addition, the issue of agricultural machinery promotion and repair also needs to be raised for research. According to a survey at the end of 1948, in Anguo County, Jizhong, North China, there was one plow for every twelve farmer households. In Shenze County, there was one harrow for every nineteen households. In Jing County, each household had an average of only 0.8 hoes. According to a survey of 46 counties in Chahar Province and southern Hebei, among 110,000 waterwheels alone, more than 26,000 were broken. The above are incomplete statistics from individual regions, but they also show that farmers need to supplement and repair agricultural tools in large quantities. There are two difficulties in supplementing agricultural tools and promoting new agricultural tools: First, farmers have low purchasing power. They desperately need agricultural tools, but they cannot afford them. Now, eating is the first priority, and dressing is the second. There is no power to expand reproduction. To solve this problem, on the one hand, production promotion cooperatives in various places need to organize the masses to purchase, and at the same time, the government must invest in agricultural machinery production to provide loans in a planned manner and pay in installments. Agriculture is still the largest production in our country, and agriculture should serve industry and cities. Industry must help agriculture in a planned manner. Developing agriculture is developing industry. Developing agriculture and increasing farmers' purchasing power will greatly promote the development of industry. The second is the technical problem of using new-style agricultural machinery: technical personnel who use new-style agricultural machinery, state-owned farms, agricultural machinery manufacturing plants, or related schools should organize short-term small training classes in a planned manner, or the government at all levels should assign specialized personnel to conduct short-term studies in manufacturing plants. These personnel can go deep into the countryside, use the slack farming season to absorb farmers to participate in short-term training in large numbers, teach farmers how to use the methods, and listen to the opinions of the masses, so as to provide opinions to improve manufacturing.

　　Regarding the repair and maintenance of agricultural machinery and tools, the North China Agricultural Machinery General Plant has established an agricultural tool repair station near Tianjin, preparing to create experience for mass promotion in the future. Larger factories in various places should divide a part of their strength to solve the problem of mass repair and maintenance, or the government at all levels should organize blacksmith shops to engage in this work in a planned manner. This work should not be ignored, as it is an important issue to strengthen ties with the masses and take root among the masses, and it is the predecessor of future tractor repair stations. In addition, in order to facilitate the repair and maintenance, the parts manufactured by various factories should be as precise as possible and conform to uniform standards, so that farmers can easily purchase replacements and avoid delaying production due to damage to agricultural tools.

　　The North China Agricultural Machinery General Plant was built on the old ruins. Thanks to the correct leadership of the Party and the efforts of all workers and staff comrades, more than 200 agricultural machines have been produced, and we strive to produce 1,100 units by the end of the year. Under the circumstances that factories in various places are turning to agricultural machinery production, we only put forward preliminary opinions and study together with comrades. This is a great and arduous task, and we should strive for the agricultural mechanization of New China under the wise leadership of the Party.

　　发展农业机械的初步意见
    华北农业机械厂总厂厂长孙景鲁
    随着人民解放战争的胜利，各地人民城市已进入和平建设。蒋介石匪帮用来制造屠杀人民武器的兵工厂和修械厂逐渐转为真正为农民服务的农业机械制造工业。仅就北平的统计，伪剿总武管会第二修械厂已改为华北农业机械总厂，并已生产了二百余部农业机械。其余六个修械厂亦已开始转上农业机械生产。农业机械制造业的发展是巩固和发展新民主主义农业的一个最重要的因素。在农村经济的将来发展方面，在迅速治疗战争的创伤方面，以及在使国家获得取之不尽用之不竭的丰饶生产品和原料方面，必将发挥显著的作用。在社会主义国家苏联和其他新民主主义国家都十分重视农业机械的发展。苏联卢波车工厂在战时制造了数千地雷，一九四五年德国投降之后，平时生产立即开始，三个月该厂就制造了两千架割草机和一千二百九十二架割禾机。在一九四五年最后的三个月中该厂又制造了六千四百架割草机和四千三百架割禾机。根据一九四五年九月二十七日苏联真理报的统计，一九四五年前后三个月和同年最初的“战时”的三个月比较起来，农业机械的生产量拖拉机增加了五倍。拖拉机拉动的条播机增加了十六倍。牲口拉动的条播机增加了十七倍，收割脱粒联合机增加了十八倍，拖拉机拉动的耕耘机增加竟达三十倍之多。捷克斯拉夫在一九四七年战后生产计划中第一季完成农业机械二三四，七二八部，实际生产量二八二，五四一部，超过原计划百分之二一·二。苏联人民称农业机械制造工业是苏维埃政权诞生的孩子。事实胜于雄辩，也只有共产党所领导的社会主义和新民主主义国家，才能把战时工业迅速转化为真正为人民服务的农业机械制造业。
    目前在中国发展农业机械，对我们是个新的问题。制造什么？农民需要什么？如何推广？都是要研究的问题。为此，华北农业机械总厂自成立以来，曾组织了宣传队携带新式农具深入农村试验并倾听群众意见，一面更与国营农场联系，作各种农业机械的试验，同时收集各地有关农具调查的材料加以研究。根据我们的初步了解，农民感受旱灾的威胁最深，所以首先希望解决农田水利问题。就华北区而言，根据一九四六年八月的统计耕地约计两亿亩（水田约占百分之十），人口约六千万人，是一个重要的农业区。由于地理条件和造林及水利工程不发达的原因，发生所谓“十年九旱”的谚语，另有些地区是“春旱夏涝”，所以灌溉或排水机械的研究和制造是首要的，农业机械制造业应有计划有步骤的逐步解决这个问题。除了发展造林、蓄水、防洪，开渠，凿井等水利工程之外，在最近数年内畜力水车似乎仍需要大量发展。因为目下农村所用的动力仍以畜力为最普遍，且一般农民对于使用水车之技术亦比较熟习。又根据我们最近在北平附近试验生铁挂斗和管子水车的纪录，效率最低者有百分之三十五，最高者亦仅百分之四十八·五，有些水车因设计不良或破损漏水，效率低至百分之二十至三十。因此我们认为设计制造两三种效率高的水车是非常必要的。明年华北人民政府农业部计划制造八万架水车，用以灌溉旱田二百万亩。采用效率较高的水车和采用效率较低的水车相比较，若就得到同量的水说，制造较好的水车假使效率平均增加百分之十，结果即可节省一万架水车的工料，约合小米一千万斤。仅生铁一项，就可节省二千四百吨，所以目前农业机械工作者，应研究设计一种效能较高的新式水车，准备此后数年内大量制造之用。至于将来的目标仍以采取离心式水泵的灌溉机械为宜。根据华北农业机械总厂设计的十五马力电力水泵，若配合凿井或利用河流制造十万部水泵，则华北一半以上之耕地灌溉问题可以解决。但水泵转速很高，所需要的动力较大，这就需要根据我们的具体条件研究农业动力问题，如蒸汽机、内燃机、电滚子等，其中风力及水力的利用，各具有地域性，如沿海一带风车可以大大利用，有河流或瀑布的地区应尽量利用其水位差按装水轮，并有计划的发展水利发电事业，是非常必要的长期建设打算。其他动力据我们的了解以电力为最廉，电业公司如在不妨碍照明和工厂用电的条件下可供给农田水利用电，有计划的推广电力灌溉区。倘试办成功则农用电动机又是需要大量制造的。
    蒸汽机的效率较低，但使用简便，不易生故障，在产煤区似仍可大量采用。制造这种蒸汽机以小型而易于移动者为佳。内燃机就使用燃料来分，有煤气机、汽油机、柴油机等。因为我国液体燃料出产不丰，比较用煤，用木柴或木炭为燃料的煤气机为合适，虽较用电贵一倍，但比用柴油贱二分之一，比用汽油贱三分之二。所以目前应当集中力量研究和制造一种农用煤气机。这在解决农业动力问题是一件重要的事。最近有人建议一、二马力小型动力可试造一种热空气机，效率虽低，但制造和使用均极简单，木柴干草等燃料农村中也易于取得，所以也颇有研究制造的价值。
    解决农田水利问题。一方面需要大量制造水车以应最近数年内的急需，同时应有计划的发展新式机械灌溉。在目前各地机器业面向农村，转向农业机械制造的情况下，应采取有计划的生产与分工，规模较大的农业机械厂如华北农业机械厂，上海中国农业公司等，可着重研究与领导。并着重一般小工厂不能制造的。例如效率高且适合于农村灌溉的抽水机，动力机和新式农业机械等，规模较小的工厂或私人铁工厂可将力量放在大量生产水车和一般农村应用的简单农具上，这样的分工在工厂管理，省工省料及减低成本上会收效很大，比想着样样都造，但样样都造不好要好得多。根据我们的了解，有些工厂一开始转业就想着造拖拉机等高级农业机械，这种想法是有害的。目前是首先解决农民当前最需要的问题，从农民的需要出发和根据农情逐渐有计划的提高，在不断发展的过程中将来大批的拖拉机奔驰在新中国的原野上是不成问题的。
    其次是一般农业机械的制造问题，耕地，播种，施肥，中耕，疏苗，除草，防治病虫害，收割，整理，加工等，这一序列的农业生产工具，由于战争及其他原因农具遭受到损失，加之和平建设期内耕地面积日益扩大，农民生产热情日益提高，需要大量的制造补充。我们的意见是城镇各小型铁工厂和乡村的铁匠炉应根据群众的需要加紧制造简单农具，而较具大规模的机器厂或转业的军火工厂应在提高生产效率的原则下，精密研究的试验和设计制造新型的马拉犁、播种机（或播种施肥机）、耘锄、疏苗机、喷雾器、喷粉器、收割机、脱粒机、精选机、轧花机、榨油机、磨粉机、碾米机等，以逐渐代替旧式的犁、劐子、耧、镰刀、锄头、扇车等，使农民熟习使用新式农具以后，大大的节省劳力，不误农时，把生产效率提高一步。例如畜力解放式耘锄，每天平均可锄地二十五亩以上，又快又好。而一般农民每年需要费五六十天用锄头来松土除草。一个勤劳的农民每天只能锄一两亩地。经过华北农业机械总厂到群众试验，农民非常欢迎解放式耘锄，我们就应依群众的意见大量制造。又如农民使用的基本农具：马拉犁，尽管各地犁的种类很多，但数千年来改进很少。有的笨重费力，或翻土不良，影响作物生长条件，或构造及材料不坚固耐用，需经详细检查比较试验。现在华北农业机械总厂正搜集各种不同的犁（其中有本国的，有苏联的，有美国的，有日本的），详细的加以试验和比较，准备设计适合于吾国各地土质的标准犁，以从事大量制造。
    在这一般农业机械制造上，我们认为应该注意到两个问题：一、创造对于本国适用的新式农具是必要的。但一切须从现实基础出发，周详的考虑到本国的农情。创造品使用的经济价值，制造成本和科学理论的根据。若仅追求新奇或幻想发明或完全抄袭他国式样都是无济于事的。最重要的是采取各国已有显著效果的新式农业机械原理再参以中国各地农情，斟酌损益，设计制造，制成后先在厂中缜密的加以试验，如有不妥，从新改进，至确能适用而后大量制造，又若国内甲地使用某种农具确有成绩，可以介绍到乙地试验，如同样好用，尽可以扩大技术交流在乙地仿造推广。二、当一种农业机械真正成功以后，则农民的需要之量必多，决非一、二厂甚至少数厂所能供给。为达到供求相应之目的，我们主张政府或研究机构，或农业机械总厂要制定各种标准农业机械的尺寸规格，有组织有计划的定额分配到各工厂去做，促使各厂专业化。甚至有些工厂专做零件，有些工厂专做装配。尽可能的采取大量制造方式，压低生产成本。同时由政府设一检验机构，检验不合格者，不予接收或不准推销。否则若使少数厂或多数厂盲目的粗制滥造，则必失掉农民的信心。这样对发展新式农业机械不但没有帮助而且是有害的。
    另外关于农业机械的推广和修配问题，也需要提出来研究，据一九四八年年底的调查，华北区冀中安国县十二户农民才有一个犁。深泽县十九户才有一个耙。景县每户平均只有○·八个锄。又据察哈尔省及冀南四十六县的调查仅水车一项，十一万部中就有二万六千多部是坏的。以上虽是个别地区不完全的统计，但也说明农民大量需要补充和修配农具。在补充农具与推广新式农具工作上有两种困难：首先农民购买力低，十分需要农具，就是买不起。现在是吃饭第一，穿衣第二，没有扩大再生产的力量。这个问题的解决，一方面需要各地生产推进社组织群众购买，同时政府须投资农业机械生产有计划的出贷，分期付款，我国的生产现在最大量的仍是农业，农业应为工业和城市服务。工业必须有计划的帮助农业。发展农业就是发展工业。把农业发展起来，农民购买力提高，也就大大的推进了工业的发展。其次是新式农业机械的使用技术问题：新式农业机械使用的技术人员，各国营农场，农业机械制造厂，或有关学校应有计划的组织短期小型训练班，或由各级政府指派专人到制造厂进行短期学习。这些人员可以深入农村，利用农闲时间大批吸收农民参加短期训练，教会农民使用方法，并倾听群众意见，借以提供意见改良制造。
    关于农业机械与农具的修配问题，华北农业机械总厂已在天津附近成立一农具修理站，准备创造经验将来大量推广，各地规模较大之工厂应该分出一部分力量解决群众的修配问题，或由各地政府有计划的组织铁匠炉从事这件工作。这件工作不应该忽视，这是加强和群众联系在群众里扎根的重要问题，这是将来拖拉机修理站的前身。另外，为了便于修配各厂制造的零件尽可能要尺寸精密适合统一标准，使农民容易购买更换，免致因农具损坏耽误生产。
    华北农业机械总厂是从旧的废墟上建设起来的，由于党的正确领导和全体工人职员同志的努力，已生产二百余部农业机械，年底争取生产一千一百部。在各地工厂转向农业机械生产的情况下，我们仅提出初步的意见和同志们共同研究，这是一个伟大而艰巨的工作，我们应该在党的英明领导下为新中国的农业机械化而奋斗。
