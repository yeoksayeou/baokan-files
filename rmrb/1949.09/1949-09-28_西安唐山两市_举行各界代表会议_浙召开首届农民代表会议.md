At the meeting, Deputy Mayor Fang Zhongru summarized the municipal work in the forty-odd days since the closing of the first conference of representatives from all circles, mainly focusing on vigorously restoring and developing production, while also carrying out the work of eliminating special agents and bandits and consolidating public security. The conference enthusiastically discussed and passed the establishment of eleven special committees for workers, farmers, youth, women, Hui people, industry and mining, transportation, commerce and finance, society, culture and education, and health, so that representatives from all circles could more closely connect with the masses and assist the Military Control Commission and the Municipal Government in promoting municipal work.

The Tangshan Municipal People's Representative Conference officially opened on the morning of the 25th, with 240 representatives from all walks of life, including workers, farmers, engineers, teachers, students, the business community, religious figures, and Hui people. Li Yifu, Mayor of Tangshan City and temporary chairman of the conference, delivered the opening speech. He first said: "The conference is being held after the official opening of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, which enables us to better unite all sectors and rely on this unity to build a new Tangshan, accepting Chairman Mao's instructions in his opening speech to the CPPCC under the task of welcoming the birth of new China." After briefly describing the workers' protection of factories and the farmers' support after Tangshan's liberation, overcoming several difficulties, he pointed out that the task of the conference was to review the work of the municipal government for nine months, study and determine future policies, and discuss and resolve proposals, especially regarding labor-capital disputes, to put production on the right track, overcome difficulties, and build a new Tangshan for the people. Subsequently, twenty-eight representatives expressed their opinions and hopes for the conference. Zhang Da, representative of the Tangshan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, stated that the Party and the government must fully listen to the opinions of the masses; at the same time, he explained that the conference was a conference of the people of Tangshan, calling on all representatives to be responsible, take a master's attitude, adhere to the truth, correct mistakes, assist the government, and supervise the government. This attitude must be maintained from beginning to end, which is the foundation for the success of the conference. Finally, by unanimous vote, a telegram was sent to Chairman Mao of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the People's Liberation Army to express respect.
