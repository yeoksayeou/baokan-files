　　[Report from this newspaper] A number of democratic figures in Beiping recently held a "White Paper" forum to expose the new conspiracies of American imperialism to invade our country.

　　Jiang Taosheng: The U.S. imperialists, in their White Paper, propose to utilize China's so-called "democratic individualists." We must expose this conspiracy and, at the same time, educate these "democratic individualists": that serving as tools for the U.S. imperialists, like the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, is to cut themselves off from the Chinese people. Truly patriotic democrats can only unite around the Chinese Communist Party, be inspired by Mao Zedong Thought, raise their political consciousness and vigilance, and avoid being exploited by the enemy. Only then will the U.S. imperialists' conspiracy be unable to succeed.

　　Shao Zonghan: What is the new policy toward China that the U.S. imperialists talk about in the White Paper? In simple terms: it is to openly be the enemy of the Chinese people. Their methods are: first, to continue to support the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. Second, to attempt to use China's "democratic individualists" to foster so-called "opposition parties." Third, to provoke the oppressed peoples of Southeast Asia and the Chinese people, creating springboards for attacking the new China in those areas. Fourth, to undermine the close cooperation between China and the Soviet Union. In response to these conspiracies of the U.S. imperialists, we must work hard in all aspects: strengthen the internal unity of the Chinese people, strengthen the close unity between China, the Soviet Union, and the oppressed peoples of Southeast Asia, in order to shatter the U.S. imperialist aggression.

　　Wu Yanin: There are three sentences in the White Paper that are laughably naive and yet extremely insidious: One says, "The CCP serves the Soviet Union." This is completely the characteristic of a "foreign Ah Q," because they themselves have stated that it was the power of the Chinese people that defeated Chiang Kai-shek. This is entirely making an issue out of nothing, deceiving the American people, and using it as an excuse to oppose the new China. Another says, "Democratic individualist elements will rebel against the CCP." Those referred to are probably the likes of Hu Shih. When the Chiang Kai-shek mad dog is about to be beaten to death, they want to mobilize powerless lice to bite the Chinese people to death. This is even more of a "foreign Ah Q's" fantasy. Another says, "If the CCP wants to invade neighboring countries, I will have to intervene." In fact, the new China, led by the CCP, will never invade neighboring countries, but will only sympathize with and help oppressed peoples to seek liberation. Facts prove that it is only the imperialist fascists who conspire to invade others. Their slanderous accusations are purely a pretense in order to organize a "Pacific Alliance" to attack the peaceful people of Asia... We should completely and systematically refute the White Paper and have it reprinted in foreign languages to expose this new conspiracy of the U.S. imperialists to the people of the world.

　　Wei Que: The White Paper completely reverses right and wrong. 1. The U.S. imperialists attempt to turn China into a colony, into an anti-Soviet base. 2. For nearly a hundred years, the U.S. imperialists have been carrying out aggression against China step by step, from proposing the Open Door Policy to China after the Sino-Japanese War to directly slaughtering the Chinese people with military fire and arms, helping the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. 3. The U.S. imperialists have thoroughly and completely carried out a policy of aggression and expansion throughout the world. Their activities in Europe are: the Marshall Plan, the Atlantic Treaty, the European Commission... Their activities in Asia are establishing the Pacific Alliance, aiding Chiang, supporting Japan, and establishing puppet regimes in various places. As for our countermeasures, they are: to liberate all of China, to eliminate reactionary forces, to conduct political education among the people, to strengthen the friendship and unity between China, the Soviet Union, and various new democracies, and to unite with the peace-loving people of all countries in the world to shatter the U.S. imperialist aggression.

　　Shen Qiyu: The U.S. imperialists have readjusted their plan of aggression against China in their White Paper, but the new plan has already been proven by old facts to be completely unworkable. One of the plans they are carrying out is large-scale armed intervention, assisting the Kuomintang in destroying the Communist Party. Another is to enable the Kuomintang to establish a regime in as many areas of China as possible, and to encourage both sides to "negotiate" in order to gradually weaken the strength of the Chinese people. For several years, the U.S. imperialists have used these two methods as mutually reinforcing and changing applications, but both have been shattered by the revolutionary forces of the Chinese people led by the CCP. Now the U.S. imperialists have devised a new conspiracy, which is to use China's so-called "democratic individualists," but under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the vigilance of the people of the whole country, this conspiracy of the U.S. imperialists will also be destroyed.

　　Shen Suwen: The U.S. imperialists published the White Paper to cover up their failure to help the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang suppress the Chinese revolution, and to conspire to continue aggression against China. This conspiracy of the U.S. imperialists will not work.

　　Feng Sutao: In the past, some people thought that it was enough for the Chinese people's revolution to oppose Chiang, and that it would be too much to oppose the United States, and that some leeway should be left; some even said, "Where is the United States imperialist?" This time, the U.S. imperialists' White Paper personally confessed to various crimes of aggression against China, which is indeed the most powerful lesson for those confused fantasists who treat the enemy as a friend and praise American civilization.

　　Zhang Motao: (1) The White Paper not only "disclaims responsibility" for the failure of aggression against China, but also lists various achievements of aggression against China over the past century "to show its merits," and further formulates various new conspiracies for aggression against China and opposition to the Soviet Union. (2) To cheer up the reactionaries of the world, especially in Asia, such as Quirino, Syngman Rhee, Nehru, and Chiang Kai-shek, to establish a "Pacific Alliance" and serve as puppets for the U.S. imperialists. (3) To conspire to attack the Chinese people and the oppressed peoples of Southeast Asia under the pretext of "the CCP serving the Soviet Union" or "China invading neighboring countries."

### 在平民主人士多人　续斥美帝白皮书

　　在平民主人士多人
  　续斥美帝白皮书
    【本报讯】在北平的一部分民主人士，于日前举行“白皮书”座谈会，揭露美帝国主义侵略我国的新阴谋。
    江涛声：美帝在白皮书中提出要利用中国的所谓“民主个人主义”者，我们要揭穿这一阴谋，同时也要教育“民主个人主义”者：象蒋匪帮那样供美帝驱使是会自绝于中国人民的。真正爱国的民主人士只有团结在中国共产党的周围，受毛泽东思想的感召，提高自己的政治觉悟与警惕，不为敌人所利用，美帝的阴谋也就无法施展了。
    邵宗汉：什么是美帝在白皮书中所说的对华新政策呢？简单一句话：就是公开的与中国人民为敌。它的办法是：第一，继续支撑蒋匪帮。第二，企图利用中国的“民主个人主义”者扶植所谓“反对派”。第三，挑拨东南亚的被压迫民族和中国人民的关系，在那些地方制造进攻新中国的跳板。第四，破坏中苏两国的亲密合作。我们针对着美帝这些阴谋，要从各方面努力：加强中国人民内部的团结，加强中苏两国及东南亚各被压迫民族的亲密团结，以粉碎美帝的侵略。
    吴研因：白皮书中有三句话，是幼稚得可笑而又非常阴险的：一句说：“中共是为苏联服务的”。这完全是“洋阿Ｑ”的本象，因为它们自己已说明了打败蒋介石的是中国人民的力量。这完全是找题目做文章，欺骗美国人民，借口反对新中国。一句说：“民主个人主义分子会对中共造反”。其所指的大概是胡适之流，当蒋介石疯狗快被打死的时候，又想动员无力的虱子来咬死中国人民。这更是“洋阿Ｑ”的幻想。一句说：“中共如要侵略邻国我就要干涉了”。其实，以中共为领导的新中国绝不会侵略邻国，只会同情和帮助被压迫民族自求解放。事实证明阴谋侵略别人的只是帝国主义法西斯们。它们这样含血喷人，完全是装腔作势，以便组织“太平洋联盟”，进攻亚洲的和平人民。………对白皮书我们应该全部的系统的加以驳斥，并可翻印成外国文字，向世界人民揭露美帝这一新阴谋。
    韦悫：白皮书完全是颠倒是非的。一、美帝企图把中国变为殖民地，变为反苏基地。二、近百年来美帝步步对中国进行侵略，从甲午战争后对中国提出门户开放政策，直到以军火武装帮助蒋匪帮直接残杀中国人民。三、美帝澈头澈尾的在世界各地进行着侵略扩张政策，在欧洲的活动是：马歇尔计划、大西洋公约、欧洲委员会………。在亚洲的活动是建立太平洋联盟，援蒋、扶日、建立各地傀儡政权。至于我们的对策则是：解放全中国，肃清反动势力，对人民进行政治教育，加强中苏及各新民主主义国家的友谊和团结，联合世界各国爱好和平的人民，粉碎美帝的侵略阴谋。
    沈起予：美帝在其白皮书中重新调整了对中国的侵略计划，但新的计划早已被旧的事实所证明，是条条行不通的。他们在计划中所进行的一条是大规模进行武装干涉，援助国民党击毁共产党。一条是使国民党尽可能在中国广大地区确立政权，并鼓励双方“协商”，以逐渐削弱中国人民的力量。数年以来，美帝以此两种办法互为表里，变换运用，但均被以中共为领导的中国人民革命的力量所粉碎了。现在美帝又订出一条新的阴谋花样，要利用中国的所谓“民主个人主义者”，但在英明的中国共产党的领导与全国人民的警觉之下，美帝的一这阴谋将同样遭到破坏。
    沈肃文：美帝发表白皮书是要掩饰他帮助蒋匪帮镇压中国革命的失败，并阴谋继续侵略中国。美帝这种阴谋是行不通的。
    冯素陶：过去有些人士认为中国人民的革命反蒋就够了，要反美就太过火，应该留些余地；有的甚至说：“美国那里是帝国主义？”这次美帝的白皮书亲自招供了侵略中国的各种罪行，这对那些糊涂的以敌为友，赞扬美国文明的幻想家，实在是一个最有力的教训。
    张默涛：（一）白皮书不但对侵华失败“卸责”，还列举了百年来侵华的各种成绩“以表其功”，更进而订出了侵华、反苏的各种新阴谋。（二）向全世界尤其亚洲各地的反动派季里诺、李承晚、尼赫鲁、蒋介石之流打气，成立“太平洋联盟”，给美帝当傀儡。（三）借口“中共为苏联服务”或“中国侵略邻邦”，而阴谋进攻中国人民和东南亚各被压迫民族。
