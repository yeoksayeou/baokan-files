The Education Bureau Holds Elementary Education Conference
	Discusses Elementary School Work Plan

[Reported by this newspaper] The Municipal People's Government Education Bureau convened a meeting yesterday (the 17th) of over thirty people, including the principals (including teaching affairs directors) of central elementary schools in the urban area and the heads of culture and education sections of district governments in the suburban area, to discuss the elementary school work plan and other issues for this semester.

At the meeting, Deputy Director Hou Junyan emphasized three central tasks for this semester: (1) Strengthening cultural education: Elementary education should focus on cultural education, and political and ideological education should be linked to reality and carried out through various courses and student activities. (2) Further improving the quality of elementary school teachers through learning: At present, the quality of most elementary school teachers is not high enough. Although the political level of most teachers has made leapfrog progress during the summer collective learning, it should continue to be improved. On the other hand, some old ideas and old styles still exist in teaching methods. In this semester, these should be thoroughly changed through political and professional learning. They have a lot of experience in teaching, and this experience should be valued and the good parts accepted. (3) Establishing and improving necessary formal systems. Some formalistic systems that were divorced from reality in the past should be corrected.

Wang, the section chief of the Education Bureau's Third Section, then spoke, proposing that elementary education should consolidate and promote democratic management, strengthen leadership over private elementary schools, and assist enterprise departments in running workers' children schools.

Regarding issues such as teaching materials and student organizations, the Education Bureau made decisions in principle. The participants engaged in heated discussions that afternoon. After a comprehensive decision is made, the Education Bureau will issue it.

　　教局召开小学教育会议
  　讨论小学工作计划
    【本报讯】本市人民政府教育局于昨（十七）日召集城区中心小学校长（包括教导主任），郊区区政府文教科长等三十余人开会，讨论本学期小学工作计划等项问题。
    会上，侯俊岩副局长着重指出本学期三项中心工作：（一）加强文化教育：小学教育要以文化教育为主，政治思想教育应联系实际，通过各种课程及学生活动来进行。（二）通过学习进一步提高小学师资：目前大多数小学教师质量还不够高，虽然在暑期集体学习中，大部分教师的政治水平已有飞跃的进步，但还应继续提高；另一方面在教学方法上，还存在着某些旧观点旧作风，在这学期里要通过政治、业务的学习，使之彻底改变。他们在教学上有不少经验，应重视这些经验，接受其中好的部分。（三）建立与健全必要的正规制度。对过去脱离实际的某些形式主义的制度，要纠正过来。
    教局三科王科长接着讲话，提出小学教育应巩固与推广民主管理，加强对私立小学的领导，并协助企业部门办好工人子弟学校。
    关于教材及学生组织等问题，教局方面作了原则上的决定，与会者在当天下午展开热烈地讨论，俟全面决定后，教育局将予发表。
