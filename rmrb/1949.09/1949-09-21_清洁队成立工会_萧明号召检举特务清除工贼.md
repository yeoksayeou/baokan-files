　　Cleaning Team Establishes Trade Union
  　Xiao Ming Calls for Reporting Special Agents and Eliminating Scabs
    [Report from this newspaper] Yesterday morning (20th) at 8:00 AM, the inaugural meeting of the Beijing Cleaning Team Trade Union was held. Xiao Ming, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, attended the meeting and spoke, pointing out that everyone should unite and run their own trade union well. Every member must understand that the trade union belongs to them, and they must pay membership dues to ensure that everyone pays attention to the progress of the trade union's work. He also hoped that everyone would conscientiously report special agents, eradicate scabs, and improve the awareness and work enthusiasm of the team members. In the afternoon, the charter was approved, and seventeen executive committee members were elected.
    The team was originally under the leadership of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and from late September will be led by the Municipal Health Bureau. The general team directly governs twelve district teams, in addition to a motor vehicle team and a repair class, with 1,826 employees.
    Before liberation, the cleaning team workers lived a hard life, with extremely low wages. Each person received a basic salary of 20 yuan per month, and sometimes after deducting food costs (two corn buns), what was left was only enough to buy two jin of corn flour. In addition, they were given half a bag of flour and issued two sets of old uniforms left over from the police each year, and lived in dilapidated housing. They were also subjected to beatings and scolding. Workers had to pay for the repair of damaged work equipment. At that time, most workers relied on "finding spare change" to make a living, mainly by collecting coal cinders, waste paper, and monthly or festival tips from residents.
    After liberation, the living standards of the workers were appropriately improved. With the help of the Municipal Transport Workers' Work Committee, a preparatory committee for the cleaning team's trade union was established on July 24th, organizing learning and carrying out cultural, recreational, and welfare work. Cooperatives and mutual aid groups were established. A short-term "trade union cadre training class" was held. The workers' work enthusiasm has greatly improved, and they start cleaning work at four o'clock every morning. In August, the trade union and the administration cooperated to organize the workers to repair more than 300 dilapidated houses. Recently, they also suggested that the administration launch a cleaning campaign to tidy up the appearance of Beijing.

### 清洁队成立工会　萧明号召检举特务清除工贼

　　清洁队成立工会
  　萧明号召检举特务清除工贼
    【本报讯】昨（二十）日上午八时，北平市清洁队工会举行成立大会。市总工会筹委会主任萧明到会讲话，指出大家要团结起来，办好自己的工会。要每个会员了解工会是自己的，一定要缴会费，使每个人都注意到工会工作的进行。并希望大家认真检举特务分子，铲除工贼，提高队员觉悟与工作积极性。下午通过会章，选出十七名执行委员。
    该队原由市公安局领导，从九月下旬起由市卫生局领导。总队部以下直辖十二个区队，此外有一个汽车队和一个修理班，现有职工一千八百二十六人。
    解放前的清洁队工人生活很苦，待遇极低，每人每月二十元底薪，有时除了扣伙食（两顿窝窝头），所剩下的只够买二斤玉米面。另外给半袋面，一年发给两套警察穿剩下的旧制服，住的地方破烂不堪。还要挨打受骂。工作用具坏了由工人自己出钱修。当时工人大都是靠“找零钱”过活，主要是检煤碴、烂纸和住户给月钱、节钱。
    解放以后，工友们的生活待遇得到了适当的改善。在市搬运工人工作委员会的帮助下，于七月二十四日成立了清洁队工会筹委会，组织学习并举办文娱、福利工作。成立了合作社和互助组。办了一个短期的“工会干部训练班”。工人们的工作情绪大大提高，每天早晨四点就开始打扫工作。八月里，工会和行政配合把工友们组织起来把破漏的三百多间房子修好。最近并建议行政上发动一次清洁运动整理北平的市容。
