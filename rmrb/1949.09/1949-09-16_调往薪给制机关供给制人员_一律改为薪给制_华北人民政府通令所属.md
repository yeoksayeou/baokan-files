The North China People's Government Order on Converting Supply System Cadres Transferred to Salary System Units to the Salary System.

[This newspaper dispatch] The North China People's Government issued an order to its subordinates on September 14th. To facilitate the work and alleviate the difficulty of sharing meals for supply system cadres assigned to work in salary system enterprises, organs, and schools, it has been decided that these personnel should be carefully evaluated based on their work ability, work history, and work attitude, and uniformly treated according to the salary system.

[Another dispatch] In order to rectify the chaotic supply procedures during cadre transfers and avoid waste, the North China People's Government has ordered its subordinates to stipulate that, henceforth, all cadre transfers and transfers of personnel detached from production (whether within the region or to other regions) must be accompanied by a supply introduction certificate issued by the original unit. The certificate must clearly state the personnel, vehicles, horses, weapons, clothing, travel expenses, and all treatment regulations accompanying the individual, as well as the start and end dates. It is stipulated that the supply introduction certificate is a necessary administrative procedure for personnel transfers.
