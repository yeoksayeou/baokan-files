    Future Business Policy:
    Master the Market with Small Profits and Quick Turnover
    The company's policy towards private merchants in its operations is not clear enough, and it has failed to systematically grasp market prices on a regular basis.
    In response to the above shortcomings and its operating experience over the past six months, the company has put forward the following directions for future business development: (1) Production, transportation, and sales must strive to maintain a consistent pace: promoters actively open up sales channels; transporters transport according to established plans; producers appropriately reduce profits, and the types of coal should take sales into consideration as much as possible. The undesirable phenomenon of production, transportation, and sales each acting independently, competing for profits, and producers and sellers not caring about each other must be strictly prohibited. After a sales contract is established, both parties should adhere to their commitments and guard against abandoning it halfway, which would affect production and sales. (2) When supplying and promoting coal, the spirit of "public first, private second" must be firmly adhered to; and the policy of small profits and quick turnover must be resolutely implemented, correcting the purely profit-driven viewpoint. (3) Transactions with public and private enterprises must be contracted and certain procedures must be followed. (4) State-owned trade operates through the market, organizing and leading private merchants to seek reasonable operations. Therefore, the company should pay attention to grasping market prices, regulating the supply and demand relationship in the market, protecting the profits of legitimate merchants, and cracking down on profiteering and speculation by unscrupulous merchants. Therefore, it is stipulated that the listed price must be suitable for the market price. It is stipulated that the factory price of coal plants directly under the company should be sold at wholesale prices, striving for large-volume wholesale and avoiding retail sales as much as possible, giving private merchants room to operate.

    今后业务方针：
    掌握市场薄利多销
    该公司在经营中对私商的方针尚不够明确，且未能经常有系统地掌握市场价格。
    该公司针对以上缺点及半年来的经营经验，提出今后开展业务的努力方向：（一）产运销三方必须力求步调一致：推销者积极地打开销路；运输者则以既定计划运输；生产者适当降低利润，且煤种尽量照顾销路。严禁产运销三者各自为政，互相争利，生产与销售者互不关心的不良现象。包销合同成立后，双方应坚守信用，谨防半途而废，影响生产与销路。（二）在供给与推销煤斤时，一定坚守先公后私的精神；并坚决执行薄利多销的方针，纠正单纯营利观点。（三）与公私企业交易，必须订立合同，履行一定的手续。（四）国营贸易是通过市场，组织与领导私商求得合理经营的。因而公司应注意掌握市场价格，调剂市场的供求关系，保护正当商人的利润，打击投机倒把的奸商。因此规定牌价必适合市价。规定公司直属的煤厂厂价应以批发价出售，力求大宗批发，避免零星出售，予私商以经营的余地。  （康伟中）
