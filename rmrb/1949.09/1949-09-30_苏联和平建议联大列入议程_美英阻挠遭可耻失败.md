Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 29th: According to TASS, New York: On September 26th, the UN General Assembly Steering Committee held a special meeting to consider including the proposal made by the head of the Soviet delegation, Vyshinsky, on the 23rd, "Condemning the Preparation of a New War and Concluding a Five-Power Treaty to Strengthen Peace" on the agenda of the General Assembly, and has decided to submit the Soviet proposal to the General Assembly for inclusion in the agenda of this session. During the discussion, British representative McNair and US representative Austin spoke. Although they did not dare to oppose the inclusion of the Soviet proposal on the agenda of the General Assembly, they both attempted to prevent the General Assembly from considering the Soviet proposal as a separate item on the agenda, thereby diluting the General Assembly's impression of this proposal and diverting the General Assembly's attention from this important issue. At the same time, while Austin stated that the US delegation did not object to the inclusion of the Soviet proposal on the agenda, he once again repeated his cliché, insisting that the Soviet proposal was "propaganda." In response to Austin's speech, Vyshinsky pointed out that any proposal from the Soviet delegation is met with resistance from the US and British representatives in the UN General Assembly, and the reasons given by the Soviet delegation to explain its proposals are invariably dismissed by them as "propaganda." The Soviet delegation could, with equal reason, consider the justifications against the Soviet proposals as propaganda. However, the Soviet proposal is propaganda for the idea of peace, it is "peace propaganda," while the propaganda against the Soviet proposal is "propaganda for a new world war." Because, it is clear to everyone, it is precisely those who oppose peace who are preparing for war. The attempt to obstruct the Soviet proposal did not receive the support of the majority of representatives in the Steering Committee, which decided to recommend to the General Assembly that the Soviet proposal be included on the agenda of this session. There was not a single vote against this proposal for inclusion on the agenda in the committee. Only Chile abstained. The committee also passed the Soviet delegation's proposal that the Soviet proposal should be discussed by the Political Committee. On the same day, the General Assembly also approved this resolution of the Steering Committee.

　　苏联和平建议联大列入议程
  　美英阻挠遭可耻失败
    【新华社北京二十九日电】据塔斯社纽约讯：九月二十六日，联大指导委员会召开特别会议，考虑将苏联代表团团长维辛斯基二十三日所提“谴责新战争准备及缔结五国加强和平公约”的建议列入大会议程的问题并已决定向大会提出将苏联建议列入本届大会的议程。在进行讨论时，英代表麦克奈尔和美代表奥斯丁发言，虽然他们都不敢反对将苏联的建议列入大会议程，但是，他们都企图阻挠由大会作为议程中单独的一项来考虑苏联的建议，从而冲淡大会对这一建议的印象，并转移大会对这一重要问题的注意。同时，奥斯丁在声言美国代表团并不反对将苏联建议列入议程时，他又一次地重复他的陈腔烂调，硬说苏联的建议是“宣传”。维辛斯基在答复奥斯丁的发言时指出：苏联代表团的任何建议，都在联大遭到美英代表的抵制，而苏联代表团提出来说明苏联建议的理由，却千篇一律地被他们指为“宣传”。苏联代表团以同样的理由也可以认为反对苏联建议的辩解是宣传。但是，苏联的建议是和平思想的宣传，是“和平宣传”，而反对苏联建议的宣传，则是“新的世界大战的宣传”。因为，谁都看得清楚，正是那些反对和平的人们在准备着战争。阻挠苏联建议的企图，并没有得到指导委员会中多数代表的支持，该委员会决定向大会建议将苏联建议列入本届大会的议程。委员会中没有一票反对这一列入议程的建议。只有智利弃权。该委员会并通过苏联代表团所提苏联建议应由政治委员会讨论的建议。同日，大会亦批准了指导委员会的这一决议。
