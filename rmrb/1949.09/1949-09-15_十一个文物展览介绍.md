The Cultural Relics Management Department of the Higher Education Committee of North China recently held eleven cultural relics exhibitions in the Palace Museum, Peking Library, History Museum, and Cultural Relics整理 (Zhengli) Committee. The exhibitions are: "Historical Materials of the Emperor and Empress's Life," "Manchu Qing Forbidden Books," "Textiles," "Jade," "Anti-Japanese War Historical Materials," "American Imperialist Aggression Against China," "Zhao Cheng Canon," "Ancient Cultural Relics Unearthed in Jingxian County of the Northern Dynasties," "Cultural Relics Donated by the People," "Newly Collected Cultural Relics," and "Chinese Ancient Architectural Standards and Drawings." The exhibitions are displayed in eleven exhibition halls of the museum and opened successively the day before yesterday.

"Historical Materials of the Emperor and Empress's Life Exhibition" is a concrete example of the extravagant life of feudal emperors, and an explanation of how they exploited the people, forcing the vast majority of the people to become ignorant, impoverished, and die. Here, the documents and objects of the "Emperor and Empress" in all aspects of clothing, food, housing, transportation, marriage, funeral, and celebration are displayed in contrast with the daily necessities of the working people. From here, we can see the extravagance and licentiousness of the emperors and the crimes of the feudal system, thus strengthening our determination to completely eradicate the feudal system.

"Forbidden Books Exhibition" are historical facts about the remnants of the Ming Dynasty after the Manchu Qing entered the customs, describing the Manchu Qing invasion. During the Qianlong period, in order to consolidate its rule, the Manchu Qing ordered all provinces to check all books, and any taboos (even a sentence or a word) would be extracted or destroyed entirely, amounting to no less than several thousand kinds. Due to the limitation of materials, only sixty-six kinds are displayed. The cases of Lü Liuliang and Wang Xihou are typical examples of literary inquisitions frequently seen under the Manchu Qing's rule for hundreds of years. From the Manchu Qing emperors' bloody control of speech alone, one can imagine how despotic and brutal the feudal emperors were to the people.

"Textiles Exhibition" showcases Chinese handicraft products before the invasion of imperialist forces, and the crystallization of the wisdom of the working people of all ethnic groups in China. It is divided into three categories: cotton, silk, and wool, including products from more than ten provinces such as Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Guizhou, Xinjiang, Gansu, and Tibet. From here, we can see how developed and exquisite China's textile industry was in the past, demonstrating the wisdom and creativity of the Chinese working people, and strengthening our confidence in building a new Chinese industry.

"Jade Exhibition" displays various objects made by jade craftsmen specially used by the emperor after the Qianlong emperor of the Manchu Qing forced thousands of Hui people in the Northwest to mine jade and transport it to Beijing for his exclusive enjoyment and appreciation. From here, we can not only see the extravagant life of the feudal emperor, but more importantly, it can show the exquisite technology and creative genius of the working people.

"American Imperialist Aggression Against China Historical Materials Exhibition" systematically compiles and displays various books, newspapers, periodicals, charts, and photos containing historical facts of American imperialist aggression against China, according to its development process. From these historical materials, we can clearly see the consistent criminal acts of American imperialism's aggression against China. By comparing it with the recently published White Paper that openly admits aggression against China, everyone can thoroughly recognize the hideous face of American imperialism. Its display layout is also divided into the following four stages according to the history of American imperialist aggression: 1. American imperialism follows or invades China through other countries. 2. Gradually invading China independently. 3. Competing for hegemony in China. 4. Conducting exclusive control of China.

"Anti-Japanese War Historical Materials Exhibition" vividly contrasts the heroic struggle of the Anti-Japanese War led by the CCP with the Kuomintang bandits' passive resistance, watching the battle, surrender, and anti-communism. Content: Emphasis on both text, charts and photos. A total of more than 400 pieces are divided into two major themes: the Communist Party's persistence in resisting Japan and the Kuomintang's surrender and anti-communism. The former includes valuable historical materials such as the Pingxingguan Victory and the Hundred Regiments Offensive, as well as democratic political construction, production movements, and activities behind enemy lines in the liberated areas. The latter includes many confidential documents of the Kuomintang reactionaries' surrender and compromise, passive resistance, and active anti-communist conspiracies.

"Zhao Cheng Canon Exhibition": The Zhao Cheng Canon was originally a large Tibetan Buddhist scripture carved in the Jin Dynasty, preserved in Guang胜寺 (Guangsheng Temple) in Zhao Cheng County, Shanxi Province. It was transferred to the Peking Library by the Taihang Administrative Office of the North China People's Government in February of this year. There are 4,430 volumes and nine large packages in total. Now, the bound Jin Canon is divided into two parts: Sutras, Vinaya, Shastras, catalogs, biographies, and works included in the canon, and selected exhibits are displayed, and samples of the Southern Canon carved in the Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties are displayed at the same time for comparison and research. It occupies an important position in the history of Tibetan scripture engraving, carrying on the past and opening up the future. During the Anti-Japanese War, the Japanese invaders wanted to seize it, but fortunately, the Eighth Route Army and guerrillas rescued it. In order to rescue this famous scripture, the Eighth Route Army sacrificed several soldiers.

"Ancient Cultural Relics Unearthed in Jingxian County of the Northern Dynasties Exhibition": The male and female servants can be used to study the evolution of costumes in the Han, Wei, and Six Dynasties, and the carved flowers in porcelain and high-footed plates can clarify the special style of porcelain in the Six Dynasties, which is helpful for the study of Chinese ceramic history.

"Cultural Relics Donated by the People Exhibition" is a collection of cultural relics donated to the country by many enthusiastic people who love cultural undertakings after the liberation of Peking. In the past six months, a total of 16,962 pieces of bronzes, porcelains, stone carvings, silk embroidery, calligraphy, paintings, and coins have been received from all walks of life. This exhibition displays only a small part of them.

"Newly Collected Cultural Relics Exhibition" are historical relics received and confiscated by the Cultural Takeover Committee of the Military Control Commission of the city after liberation and transferred to the History Museum for safekeeping. There are 13,345 pieces of bronzes, porcelains, lacquer wares, Tibetan scriptures, etc. Now, a selection of fine works is displayed.

"Chinese Ancient Architectural Standards and Drawings Exhibition": Here, we can see that ancient Chinese architecture has a special form of our national culture and art. This time, perspective color paintings and historical explanations are used to show the origin and purpose of various types of buildings, patterns and standard explanations are used to show the special structure of buildings, and models and physical samples are used to show the overall impression of buildings and auxiliary projects.

　　十一个文物展览介绍
    高教会文管处
    华北高等教育委员会所属故宫博物院、北平图书馆、历史博物馆、文物整理委员会四个文物机关最近举办的“帝后生活史料”、“满清禁书”、“纺织品”、“玉石”、“抗日史料”、“美帝侵华”、“赵城藏”、“景县北朝出土古文物”、“人民捐赠文物”、“新收文物”与“中国古建筑法式图法”等十一个文物展览，分别陈列于该院馆内十一个展览室，已于前天先后开幕。
    “帝后生活史料展览”，这是封建帝王穷奢极欲生活的具体例证，这是压榨人民、迫使广大人民走向愚昧、贫困与死亡的说明。这里特把“帝后”的衣食住行婚丧喜庆等各方面的文献和实物，与劳苦大众的日常生活用品对比陈列。从这里可以看出帝王的骄奢淫佚与封建制度的罪恶，从而坚定我们彻底铲除封建制度的意志。
    “禁书陈列展览”，是满清入关后，关于明末遗民记述满清侵略的史实。乾隆时，满清为了巩固其统治权，命令各省检查各书，有忌讳处（甚至一句一字）即予以抽毁或全毁，先后不下数千种之多。因为材料的限制，仅陈列六十六种。其中的吕留良案、王锡侯案系满清数百年统治下屡见不鲜的文字狱的典型实例。仅仅从满清皇帝对言论的血腥统治这一点，就可以想见封建帝王对人民是何等专横残暴。
    “纺织品陈列展览”，这是帝国主义势力未侵入中国前的中国手工业产品，这是中国各民族劳动人民的智慧结晶。分棉、丝、毛三大类。包括苏、浙、黔、新、甘、藏……等十余省的产品。从这里可以看到我国以前纺织业如何发达，品质如何精美，表现了中国劳动人民的智慧与创造力，可以加强我们建设新中国工业的信心。
    “玉石玉器陈列展览”，这是满清乾隆以皇帝权威迫使西北回民数千人开山取玉，运到北京由皇帝专用玉匠雕琢成的各种器物，供他一人享受玩赏的。从这里不仅可以看出封建皇帝骄奢的生活，更主要的它可以表现出劳动人民精美的技术与创造的天才。
    “美帝侵华史料展览”，是将载有美帝侵略中国史实的各种书报、期刊、图表、照片，依着它发展的过程作有系统的编纂陈列。从这些史料中可以清楚地看到美帝一贯侵略中国的罪恶行为。把它同最近发表的公开承认侵略中国的白皮书对照起来看，大家更可以彻底的认清美国帝国主义的狰狞面目。其陈列布置还根据美帝的侵略历史，分为下列四个阶段：一、美帝追随或通过别国向中国侵略。二、逐渐单独的侵略中国。三、争夺在中国的霸权。四、进行独占中国。
    “抗日战争史料展览”，这里是把中共领导的抗日战争的英勇斗争史实与蒋匪的消极抗战、观战、投降、反共作了一幅鲜明的对照。内容：文字与图表、照片并重。总计共四百多件，分为共产党的坚持抗战与国民党的投降反共两大主题。前者包括有平型关大捷、百团大战等珍贵史料以及解放区民主建政、生产运动、敌后活动等。后者有许多国民党反动派投降妥协和消极抗战、积极反共等阴谋机密文件。
    “赵城藏展览”，赵城藏是原来保存在山西赵城县广胜寺的一部金代雕刻大藏经，系今年二月北平解放后华北人民政府由太行行署移送给北平图书馆的。凡四千四百三十卷又九大包。现特将装订好的金藏，分作经律论目录传记及入藏著述两部分，择尤展览，并将宋、元、明三朝刻的南系大藏经样本同时陈列，以便比较研究。它在藏经雕板史上占有继往开来的重要地位。抗日期间，日寇想抢走它，幸赖八路军、游击队把它抢救出来。为了抢救这部名经，八路军曾牺牲了几位战士。
    “景县北朝出土古文物展览”，其中的男佣女佣可资研究汉魏六朝服饰的演变，瓷中的雕花樽、高足盘，可阐明六朝瓷器的特殊风格，有助于中国陶瓷史的研究。
    “人民捐赠文物展览”，系北平解放后很多热心人民文化事业的人士，把个人最心爱的文物捐赠给国家的。半年来共收到各界人士捐赠的铜器、瓷器、石刻、丝绣、字画、钱币凡一万六千九百六十二件。此次陈列的是其中的一小部分。
    “新收文物展览”，这是解放后本市军管会文化接管委员会所接收与没收拨交历史博物馆保管的历史文物。计有铜器、瓷器、漆器、藏经等一万三千三百四十五件。今选出其中精品一部陈列。
    “中国古建筑法式图片展览”，这里可看出我国古代建筑具有我民族文化艺术特殊形式。这次是用透视颜色画和历史的说明来表示各种类建筑物的来源和用处，用图案和法式的说明来表示建筑物的特殊结构，用模型和实物的样本来表示建筑物的整体和附属工程的印象。
