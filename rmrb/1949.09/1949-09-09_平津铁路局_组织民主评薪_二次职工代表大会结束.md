The Pingjin Railway Bureau
　Organizes Democratic Wage Assessment; Second Employee Representative Congress Concludes

[Report from this newspaper] Following the completion of democratic job evaluation work at the end of August, the Pingjin Railway Bureau has now launched democratic wage assessment work. On September 4th, the bureau convened its second employee representative congress, attended by approximately 200 representatives from various regional labor unions and employees, along with all section chiefs and higher-level cadres from within the bureau's various departments. The congress lasted for three days and nights, with lively discussions and excellent results. It concluded successfully on the evening of the 6th, and the representatives returned to their posts to organize and carry out the democratic wage assessment work.

On the first day of the congress, Xu Ping, Deputy Director of the Railway Bureau's Trade Union, first conveyed the proceedings and resolutions of the National Trade Union Work Conference. On the second day, Deputy Director Liu Jianzhang gave a detailed report on the democratic wage assessment work, pointing out that the wage assessment work mainly relies on the masses, promotes democracy, and is to be completed through the joint efforts of everyone. He also explained the characteristics of the new wage plan, stating that it is fundamentally different from the old wage plan and is currently the most progressive and reasonable plan. Both reports were discussed in detail by the representatives in groups, and suggestions for revisions were put forward. On the afternoon of the 6th, Director Guo Hongtao gave a concluding speech, saying: "The meeting was very successful and fruitful. Based on many constructive opinions, it proves that everyone's sense of ownership has been further enhanced, and they have realized that workers' lives cannot be improved in isolation in the construction, and individual and temporary interests should be subordinate to the overall and permanent interests." Finally, he pointed out: The wage assessment work should be vigorously promoted by doing propaganda and explanation work under the principle of frugality, overcoming difficulties, and doing a good job in railway, so as to get all employees thinking, and to grasp the principles to proceed. And he called on everyone to combine the wage assessment work with the realization of democratic management, and strive to complete it victoriously by the end of September.

　　平津铁路局
  　组织民主评薪 　 二次职工代表大会结束
    【本报讯】平津铁路局于八月底完成民主评职工作后，刻又展开了民主评薪工作。九月四日路局召开全局第二次职工代表大会，到各地区工委及职工代表约二百人，局内各处室课长级以上干部全体参加，连续三昼夜，讨论热烈，收获很好。六日晚圆满结束，代表们纷纷返回岗位，组织与开展民主评薪工作。
    大会第一日，首由路局总工会徐平副主任传达了全国工会工作会议经过与决议精神。第二日刘建章副局长对民主评薪工作作了详细报告，指出评薪工作主要是依靠群众，发扬民主，由大家共同努力来完成。并说明新工资方案的特点，它与旧工资方案原则上不同，是目前最进步最合理的方案。两次报告均经各代表们分组详细讨论，提出修改意见。六日下午由郭洪涛局长总结，他说：“会议开得很好，收获很大，根据许多建设性的意见，证明大家主人翁的思想已又提高了一步，体会到在建设问题上工人生活不能单独提高，个人利益暂时利益应当服从全体利益及永久利益。最后指出：评薪工作要在节衣缩食，克服困难，把铁路搞好原则下，大力开展宣教解释工作，搞通全体职工思想，掌握着原则进行。并号召大家，把评薪工作与实现管理民主化工作结合起来，争取在九月底胜利完成。
