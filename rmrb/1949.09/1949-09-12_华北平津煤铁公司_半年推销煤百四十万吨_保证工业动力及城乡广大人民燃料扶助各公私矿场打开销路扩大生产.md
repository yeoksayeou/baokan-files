(Special Dispatch from our Tianjin Correspondent) The North China Tianjin Coal and Iron Company has unified the sales of coal produced in North China, guaranteeing the supply of coal to industry, urban residents, and the broad masses of the countryside in North China and other liberated areas. Significant achievements have been made in the past six months. According to company statistics: Before the liberation of Beiping, the company purchased more than 80,000 tons of Mentougou coal in exchange for a large amount of grain. After liberation, it continued to exclusively sell 200,000 tons of coal from the mine. For the Yangquan and Jingxing mines along the Zhengtai Railway, a long-term exclusive sales approach was adopted from last year to June of this year, totaling 284,491 tons in six months. For the Datong and Xiahuayuan mines along the PingSui Railway, an appropriate purchasing method was adopted, totaling 167,261 tons in six months. Since the liberation of Tianjin, the company has purchased coal quotas from the Kailuan mine and coal tickets issued to employees of the mine in exchange for a large amount of currency and goods (cloth, flour). Starting in June, it exchanged 200,000 bags of flour for coal each month, totaling 684,385 tons of coal from the mine in six months (including 380,000 tons of coal tickets for workers), estimated to be 47 percent of the mine's total output. In addition, the company purchased 3,800 tons of coal from the Great Wall Mine in the past six months. In total, the company has exclusively sold, ordered, and purchased 1,421,937 tons of coal from various mines in the past six months. This has partially solved the production and sales problems of various mines, guaranteed the mines' expenditures, stabilized the lives and production morale of employees, and enabled the mines to continue to expand reproduction. For example, the daily coal production of Kailuan Mine was 3,400 tons at the beginning of liberation, and the daily output in July increased to nearly 12,000 tons. The daily coal production of Mentougou Mine was 2,000 tons at the beginning of liberation, and the daily output in July reached 4,000 tons. The private small coal kilns in Xiahuayuan, with the support of the company, have also increased their daily output from the initial 150 tons to 770 tons.

On the other hand, while guaranteeing sales channels, the company has also supplied fuel to state-owned and private factories, cooperatives, citizens of large and medium-sized cities such as Ping, Jin, Bao, Zhang, and Shi, the vast rural areas along the PingSui, PingHan, PingJin, BeiNing, and ShiDe railways, and the fuel needs of troops in various regions.

In summarizing its work in the past six months, the company affirmed the above achievements, but also clearly pointed out that there are still many shortcomings in its business operations that need to be corrected in the future. The first of these shortcomings is that some leading cadres of the company still have a purely profit-seeking mentality. For example, the Zhengtai Coal and Iron Company, which exclusively sold coal from Yangquan and Jingxing, only complained that the cost of coal production at the mine was too high and the sales profit was too low. Therefore, the exclusive sales went from large-scale to small-scale, and from small-scale to no exclusive sales, which affected the sales of the mine's coal and affected the supply for industry, cities, and rural areas. At the same time, there is a phenomenon of neglecting the countryside because the focus of supply and sales is placed on cities. After the company established exclusive sales business relationships with various mines, it sometimes failed to pay the mines on time and did not try its best to find sales channels for the coal that the mines had already produced, but emphasized that the coal produced was not suitable for the season and was difficult to sell. For example, the company emphasized that the mixed coal produced by Yangquan Mine this spring was not easy to sell, resulting in very little sales.

　　华北平津煤铁公司
　  半年推销煤百四十万吨
    保证工业动力及城乡广大人民燃料　扶助各公私矿场打开销路扩大生产
    【本报天津专讯】华北平津煤铁公司统一推销华北产煤，保证供给华北及其他解放区的工业、城市市民与广大农村的需要，半年来获得了显著的成绩。据该公司统计：北平未解放前，该公司即以大批的粮食换购门头沟煤八万多吨，解放后又长期包销该矿煤二十万吨。正太线上之阳泉、井陉两矿产煤，从去年到今年六月都是采取了长期包销的办法，半年来共收二八四、四九一吨。平绥线上之大同，下花园矿煤则采取了适当的收购办法，半年来共收煤一六七、二六一吨。自天津解放后，该公司即以大量的货币和实物（布、面）收购开滦矿的煤斤及该矿发给职工的煤票；六月份起，每月又以二十万袋面粉换煤，总计半年共收该矿煤六八四、三八五吨（内工人煤票三十八万吨），估该矿总产量的百分之四十七。此外该公司半年来收购长城矿煤三、八○○吨。总计半年以来，该公司共统一包销、订购、收购各矿煤计一、四二一、九三七吨。这样就部分地解决了各矿的生产销路，保证了矿方的开支，稳定了职工的生活及生产情绪，使各矿获得继续扩大再生产的可能。如开滦矿解放初日产煤三、四○○吨，七月份日产量增达近一二、○○○吨。门头沟矿解放初日产煤二、○○○吨，七月份日产煤四、○○○吨。下花园私营小窑煤，经该公司扶植，亦使其由初期日产一五○吨，增加到日产七七○吨。
    在保证销路的另一面，该公司也就供给了国营私营工厂、合作社，平、津、保、张、石等大中城市的市民，平绥、平汉、平津、北宁、石德沿线广大农村，以及各地部队的燃料问题。
    在该公司总结半年来的工作时，肯定了以上的成绩，也明确指出在经营业务中尚存在着不少缺点，有待今后纠正。这些缺点首先是该公司个别领导干部还残存着单纯营利思想，如正太煤铁公司包销阳泉、井陉煤，只嫌该矿产煤成本过高，推销利薄，因而，从大包销变为小包销，由小包销变为不包销，致影响了该矿产煤的销路及影响工业，城市与农村的供用。同时，由于供销重点放在城市，对农村有忽略的现象。该公司在和各矿建立了包销的业务关系后，有时不能如期给矿上付款，亦没有给矿方已出产之煤竭力寻找销路，却强调生产之煤不合乎季节难以推销。如阳泉矿今春出产的混煤，公司强调不好销，致推销极少。
