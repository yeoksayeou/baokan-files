Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 11th: Warsaw dispatch: Workers across Poland have been holding meetings to condemn the Tito clique for betraying the working class and selling out the Yugoslav people to American and British imperialists. Railway workers in Poznan, municipal workers in Torun, and workers in various industries in Lublin have passed resolutions strongly protesting the fascist crimes of Tito and Ranković, and expressing support for the Yugoslav people who are fighting to eliminate this traitorous clique.

Following the Polish government's note to Yugoslavia on the 9th, pointing out that the Tito government has dispatched spies and subversive elements to Poland, the People's Voice newspaper published a commentary stating: This activity of the Tito clique is no different from the subversive activities of its masters, American and British imperialists. Thus, Tito recently obtained US dollars in the form of an American loan.

Furthermore: The Tito government has forbidden the Yugoslav people from listening to Moscow Radio. In many residential areas, the police have confiscated radios.

　　波兰各地工人集会谴责阶级叛徒铁托
　  声援斗争中的南斯拉夫人民
    【新华社北平十一日电】华沙讯：波兰各地工人纷纷举行会议谴责铁托集团背叛工人阶级，把南斯拉夫人民出卖给美英帝国主义者。波兹南铁路工人、托伦市市政工人及卢布林各业工人通过决议坚决抗议铁托与兰科维奇的法西斯罪行，并对正在为消灭这个叛徒集团而斗争的南斯拉夫人民表示声援。
    波政府九日致南照会指出铁托政府派遣间谍和阴谋颠覆分子到波兰之后，人民言论报发表评论称：铁托集团这一活动与它的主子美英帝国主义的颠覆活动毫无分别。这样，铁托最近就在美国贷款的形式下得到了美元。
    又讯：铁托政府已禁止南斯拉夫人民收听莫斯科广播。在许多居民区，警察已没收了收音机。
