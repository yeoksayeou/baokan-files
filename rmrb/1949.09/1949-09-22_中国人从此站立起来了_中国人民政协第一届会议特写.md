　　“The Chinese People Have Stood Up”
    ——A Special Feature on the First Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference
    Li Zhuang
    "The Chinese people, who account for one-quarter of humanity, have stood up." Chairman Mao said in his opening speech at the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference: "We have united, overthrown internal and external oppressors through the People's War of Liberation and the People's Great Revolution, and announced the founding of the People's Republic of China."
    This is a grand ceremony for the founding of a new people's democratic China. This grand ceremony took place on September 21, 1949, in Beiping, the people's capital. Chairman Mao announced the official opening of this grand ceremony, and the band immediately played "March of the People's Liberation Army," and salutes thundered outside the venue. This is the sound of victory. We deeply understand in the arduous struggle that victory is not easy to come by. The Communist Party of China has been established for twenty-eight years, and the People's Liberation Army has been established for twenty-two years. From the beginning to the present, it has been leading the people of the whole country in arduous battles with enemies at home and abroad. These twenty-odd years have turned youth into middle age, and middle age into old age. Many martyrs have sacrificed heroically for the revolution, but the people have finally won victory and created a new people's democratic China. Therefore, the people of the whole country expressed their sincere support for the Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the People's Liberation Army. All the delegates in the hall also loved and respected the Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the People's Liberation Army without exception. The CPC delegation became the chief representative of the parties at the conference; when Chairman Mao entered the venue, the entire audience stood up and applauded for as long as two minutes. His opening speech was frequently interrupted by warm applause. The representatives of the People's Liberation Army – combat heroes Li Guoying, Wei Xiaotang, Wei Laiguo, and Liu Meicun – were elected to the presidium. When they ascended the podium, all the delegates warmly applauded and welcomed them. General Chen Yi said in his speech, "Representing all commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, I express unconditional support for the CPPCC conference." He said, "The Chinese People's Liberation Army is ready at any time to be dispatched by the Central People's Government to fight to the end to eliminate the remaining enemies and defend the independence and freedom of the new China." People applauded enthusiastically, thanking the strong defenders of the new China and taking pride in the fact that the CPPCC had obtained this reliable pillar.
    In her speech, Ms. Soong Ching Ling said that the establishment of the CPPCC "is a historical leap forward." Indeed, it has only been a little over a year and four months since the CPC put forward the call for convening a political consultative conference without the participation of reactionaries last year on May 1st. The time is not long, but the situation in China has changed drastically. The People's Liberation Army made rapid and victorious advances. All the outstanding figures in China flocked to the liberated areas and to Beiping, where the CPC Central Committee was located. The leadership of the CPC plus the unity of democratic forces throughout the country made the revolution victorious, and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference was convened. Everything in the venue reflected this real situation.
    When Mr. Soong Ching Ling, He Xiangning, Zhang Lan, Huang Yanpei, Gao Gang, Li Lisan, Saifuddin, Zhang Zhizhong, Cheng Qian, Situ Meitang and others spoke, they unanimously praised the wise leadership of the CPC and Chairman Mao, and firmly believed that with the concerted unity and joint struggle of the entire people, the new people's China would definitely be successfully built. Look! On the rostrum, huge portraits of Sun Yat-sen and Mao Zedong are hung, and in the middle of the portraits is the emblem of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. The front of the emblem is a globe, and in the middle of the globe is a red map of China. There are four red flags on the map, symbolizing four friends. Ears of wheat decorate the left and right sides of the globe, and a wheel decorates the top of the globe. The ears of wheat and wheels represent peasants and workers, and a red five-pointed star is attached to the middle of the wheel, symbolizing the leadership of the working class. The entire venue is a concrete manifestation of this emblem. More than 600 delegates included representatives from all classes and nationalities in the Chinese People's Democratic United Front. The seats for party representatives were in the right front of the rostrum, with the CPC representatives in the first row and Chairman Mao as the chief. The seats for military representatives were in the left front of the rostrum, with the headquarters of the People's Liberation Army in the first row and Commander-in-Chief Zhu as the chief. Behind the People's Liberation Army were specially invited representatives, and the seats for regional representatives and group representatives were on both sides of the party and military representatives. The conference was packed with people, truly an unprecedented national unity. Class unity and national unity have been fully demonstrated in the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and the same is true in terms of age. He Xiangning and her son Liao Chengzhi are both representatives to the CPPCC; Sa Zhenbing is ninety-two years old, and Yan Fumin, the representative of the All-China Students' Federation, is only twenty-one years old, less than a quarter of the former's age. Everyone unites and strives together, which guarantees the grand ceremony for the founding of the new People's China held in Huairen Hall, turning the palace of feudal emperors and the Chiang family's small court into a people's deliberation hall.
    The people decorated the venue simply and magnificently. The emblem was set against an apricot-yellow curtain, which in China symbolizes solemnity and greatness. The venue was lit entirely with mercury lamps, one after another, and red palace lanterns lined the two corridors. Xinhua Gate was newly painted, bright red and dazzling, with eight red flags erected on both sides. Huge palace lanterns hung under the door. All of this gave people an impression full of vitality. The Chinese nation was originally a nation full of vitality, but in the past it was bound by imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism and could not develop. Now that it is truly liberated, it is believed that it will not take long for the new China to be built very well. The congratulatory banners sent to the conference from all sides were full of this praise and confidence. The congratulatory banner sent to the conference by all the overseas Chinese in North Korea was exquisitely embroidered with a colored portrait of Chairman Mao. The background of the embroidery was the flag of the Communist Party of China, as well as a factory and several tractors. The flag was also embroidered with the words "Celebrating the birth of the new China, advancing under the banner of Mao Zedong." This picture shows that an industrialized China, an independent, free, and prosperous new China is waving to us.
    Progressive people all over the world are paying attention to us and cheering and celebrating us. Enemies at home and abroad may be cursing us in dark corners. However, we have the strength and the confidence to "let those reactionaries at home and abroad tremble before us!" (Words of Chairman Mao in the opening speech of the conference)

　　“中国人从此站立起来了”
    ——中国人民政协第一届会议特写
    李庄
    “占人类总数四分之一的中国人从此站立起来了。”毛主席在中国人民政治协商会议的开幕词中说：“我们团结起来，以人民解放战争和人民大革命打倒了内外压迫者，宣布中华人民共和国的成立了。”
    这是人民民主新中国开基立业的盛典。这个盛典是一九四九年九月二十一日，在人民首都北平举行的。毛主席宣布这个盛典正式开幕，乐队立即奏起“人民解放军进行曲”，礼炮在会场外隆隆齐鸣。这是胜利的声音，我们在艰苦的斗争中深深地懂得，胜利是不容易得来的。中国共产党成立了廿八年，人民解放军建立了廿二年，从开始到现在，一直领导全国人民，和国内外的敌人艰苦的战斗着。这二十多年，使青年变成中年，中年变成老年，多少烈士为革命而英勇牺牲了，但是，人民终于胜利了，打出了一个人民民主的新中国。于是全国人民表示竭诚拥护共产党、毛主席和解放军，全场代表也毫无例外地热爱、尊敬共产党、毛主席和解放军。中共代表团在大会上，成为党派代表的首席；毛主席进入会场时，全场起立鼓掌达两分钟之久。他的开幕词经常为热烈的掌声所打断。人民解放军的代表——战斗英雄李国英、魏小堂、魏来国、刘梅村被选入主席团，他们登上主席台时，全体代表热烈鼓掌欢迎。陈毅将军讲话时，“代表中国人民解放军全体指战员表示无条件拥护人民政协大会，”他说：“中国人民解放军随时准备着，听候中央人民政府的调用，为消灭残余敌人和保卫新中国的独立自由而奋斗到底。”人们狂热的鼓掌，感谢新中国的坚强保卫者，骄傲于人民政协得到了这个可靠的柱石。
    宋庆龄先生在会上讲话，她说人民政协的成立“是一个历史的跃进。”真的，从去年“五一”中共提出召开没有反动分子参加的政治协商会议的号召以来，到现在只有一年又四个多月的工夫，时间不长，中国的情势却大变了。人民解放军神速的胜利进军。全中国的优秀人物都涌向解放区，涌向中共中央所在地的北平。中共的领导加上全国民主力量的团结，使得革命胜利了，人民政治协商会议召开了。会场的一切，都反映了这种真实的情况。
    宋庆龄、何香凝、张澜、黄炎培、高岗、李立三、赛福鼎、张治中、程潜、司徒美堂等先生讲话时，一致赞扬中共与毛主席的英明领导，坚信全体人民一致团结，共同奋斗，人民新中国一定建设成功。看吧！在主席台上，悬挂着孙中山、毛泽东的巨幅画像，画像中间是人民政治协商会议的会徽。会徽正面为一地球，地球中间是一幅红色的中国地图。地图上面有四面红旗，象征四个朋友，地球左右饰以麦穗，地球上面饰以车轮，麦穗与车轮表示着农民和工人，车轮中间缀一红色五角星，象征着工人阶级的领导。整个会场是这个会徽的具体表现。六百多位代表，包含了中国人民民主统一战线中各阶级、各民族的代表人物。党派代表的席位在主席台右前方，中共代表位第一排，毛主席为首席。主席台左前方为部队代表的席位，人民解放军总部位第一排，朱总司令为首席。解放军后面是特邀代表，区域代表和团体代表的席位在党派与部队代表的两旁。大会济济一堂，真是空前的民族大团结。阶级的团结、民族的团结已经从人民政治协商会议的共同纲领上充分地表现出来了，即以年龄而论，也同样说明了这种情况。何香凝和廖承志母子二人，都是政协的代表；萨镇冰已经九十二岁了，中华全国学生联合会的代表晏福民，只有二十一岁，还不及前者的四分之一。大家团结起来一起奋斗，这就保证了在怀仁堂举行人民新中国开基立业的大典，变封建帝王和蒋家小朝廷的宫殿为人民的议事厅。
    人民把会场布置得朴素而壮丽。会徽后面衬着杏黄色的幕布，在中国，这种颜色是象征庄严与伟大的。会场照明全用水银灯，一个接着一个，两廊下排着红色宫灯。新华门油漆一新，鲜红夺目，两边竖着八面红旗。门下挂着巨大宫灯。这一切，都给人们一种富有生命力的印象。中华民族本来是富有生命力的民族，过去被帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义束缚着不能发展，现在真正解放了，相信不要很多时候，新中国就会建设得很好。在各方面送给大会的贺幛中，充满了这种赞美与自信。北朝鲜全体华侨送给大会的贺幛上，精致地绣着彩色的毛主席像，绣像的背景是中国共产党的党旗，还有一座工厂和几部拖拉机。旗上还绣着“庆祝新中国诞生，在毛泽东旗帜下前进”的字。这幅画案表示：工业的中国，独立、自由、富强的新中国在向我们招手了。
    全世界的进步人士都在注意着我们，向我们欢呼庆祝。国内外的敌人也许在阴暗的角落里正对我们诅咒着。但是，我们有力量，有信心，“让那些内外反动派在我们面前发抖罢！”（毛主席在大会开幕词中语）
