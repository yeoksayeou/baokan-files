　　Changsha Students Struggling from Darkness to Dawn

　　The student movement in Changsha grew stronger in the midst of selfless struggle against the Kuomintang reactionaries' suppression. After the news of the Nanjing Kuomintang government's massacre of students on "April 1st" this year reached Changsha, the students of Changsha, who had been suppressed for a long time, roared on April 7th. They broke through the school authorities' prison-like control, shouting slogans such as "Striving for genuine peace" and protesting the massacre of students. The magnificent and passionate ranks surged into the city like a tide. The Changsha City Student Union was also formally established five days after "April 7th" (April 12th). The student movement rapidly expanded to various schools outside the Changsha area. The reactionaries carried out frantic persecution of the student movement. On April 13th, students from various primary and secondary schools in Yueyang held a memorial service and parade to protest the "April 1st" massacre, which was met with beatings and shootings by special agents and bandits, resulting in more than a dozen students being injured on the spot. Xiao Man, a teacher at Hubin Middle School, even had one of his ears cut off. In Changsha, the students' democratic movement also suffered cruel persecution under the Kuomintang reactionaries' so-called "martial law."
　　On May 28th, the White bandits fled from Wuhan to Hunan in a state of disarray and first attacked the peace movement in Hunan. The Student Union was the most severely persecuted among them. On June 13th, Student Union representatives Long Hanhe (Hunan University) and Zhong Zhenlun (Changsha Municipal First Middle School) were arrested by more than a dozen armed special agents while attending a Student Union district committee meeting at Yifang Middle School. Students from various schools ran around appealing for assistance from all walks of life and protesting to the pseudo-security organs for the arrested representatives, gaining the support of the broad masses of the people. On June 22nd, the White bandits had no choice but to release the arrested student representatives. However, just as the students were welcoming their newly freed classmates, Gao Jiqing, the chairman of the Self-Government Association of Keqiang College, "disappeared" again. Three days later, the body of Comrade Gao Jiqing appeared on a barren ridge outside the North Gate of Changsha, covered in nine stab wounds. He had been strangled half to death with a rope before being buried alive. His swollen body had a pair of angry eyes. The seeds of hatred were deeply planted in the students' hearts. They buried Martyr Gao at the foot of Yuelu Mountain, vowing before his grave to repay blood debts with blood.
　　Then, the White bandits issued an order to dissolve the Student Union and forced the schools to start their holidays early. Bandit troops stationed in the schools and destroyed them. The White bandits were still not at ease and sent so-called "Youth Work Team" members to infiltrate the student masses to carry out sabotage. Because the situation was getting worse day by day, the Student Union had to go underground again, launching a property protection and school protection movement. On the one hand, they used individual persuasion and discussion meetings to win over teachers and students to stay at school. On the other hand, they went deep into the broad masses, opening up people's schools, women's literacy classes, workers' night schools, and closely uniting with the people. At that time, it was very difficult for the students who remained at school to get food. The Student Union then promoted a mutual aid movement, and various schools also used dance parties, concerts, and other means to raise funds for part of the food expenses. At the same time, they launched labor production, cooking their own meals, carrying water, growing vegetables, and raising pigs, using close unity to resist the persecution of the Kuomintang bandit gang. In this way, the Student Union united the students who remained and supported each other arduously until the arrival of liberation.
　　After the news of the peaceful liberation of Changsha spread, the Student Union, together with the Federation of Trade Unions, the Women's Federation, and others, jointly initiated the establishment of a preparatory committee to welcome the People's Liberation Army, preparing to welcome them. On the morning of the third day, thousands of male and female students gathered at Xiaowumen amidst thousands of lights and colorful decorations. The People's Liberation Army had arrived. Applause, shouts, laughter, firecrackers, gongs, and drums shook the sky. Everyone sang and danced to their hearts' content. After years of shackles being broken, they were truly indescribably relaxed and happy. All the students launched extensive propaganda work. Cartoons, songs, dances, and living newspapers appeared on the streets every day. They explained the current situation and the various policies of the Chinese Communist Party to the citizens, exposing the White bandits' brutal acts in Changsha. Then, the movement to support the army heatedly unfolded. The students carried the vegetables they grew, the fattened pigs they raised, the fresh fish they caught, the rice they saved by eating less, and the money and goods they earned from charity sales and donations, and presented them to their beloved and heroic People's Liberation Army. The students and workers of Hunan Provincial First Normal School, Chairman Mao's alma mater, saved two shi of rice and one jin of salt from their meals, as well as two loads of gourds they grew themselves. They were personally delivered to the People's Liberation Army by seven workers and students. Many students volunteered to wash and sew clothes for the People's Liberation Army and held comfort meetings. In contact with the People's Liberation Army, they sincerely learned the spirit of serving the people.

　　从黑暗中奋斗到天明的长沙学生
    杨澍
    长沙的学生运动，是在对国民党反动派的镇压作奋不顾身的斗争中壮大起来的。今年“四一”南京国民党政府屠杀学生惨案的消息传到长沙后，四月七日那天，长期被压制着的长沙学生怒吼了。他们冲破学校当局牢狱式的管制，高喊出“争取真和平”、抗议屠杀学生的口号，雄壮的激昂的行列，潮水般地涌进市区。长沙市学生联合会，也在“四七”后的第五天（四月十二日）正式成立了。学生运动迅速扩展到长沙区以外的各个学校。反动派对学生运动进行疯狂的迫害。岳阳各中小学学生在四月十三日为抗议“四一”惨案而举行的追悼和游行，就遭到特务匪徒的毒打和枪杀，当场受伤的有十几个学生。湖滨中学的教员萧曼竟被割去一只耳朵。在长沙，学生的民主运动也在国民党反动派的所谓“戒严法”下，受到残酷的迫害。
    五月二十八日，白匪由武汉狼狈逃到湖南，首先打击湖南的和平运动，其中被迫害最烈的就是学联。六月十三日，学联代表龙汉河（湖南大学）钟振伦（长沙市立第一中学），在艺芳中学参加学联区委会时，被十几个武装特务抓了去。各校学生为抓了去的代表奔走呼号，请求各界援助，并向伪治安机关抗议，获得了广大人民的支持。六月二十二日，白匪不得不释放了被捕的学生代表。但是，正当同学们迎接刚获得自由的同学时，克强学院自治会的理事长高继青又“失踪”了。三天之后，高继青同学的尸首出现在长沙北门外的一条荒岭上，浑身上下被扎了九刀，是先用绳勒得半死，然后活埋的。浮肿的身体，张着一双愤怒的眼睛。仇恨的种子深深种在学生的心里。他们安葬高烈士在岳麓山畔，在坟前宣誓，血债要用血来偿还。
    接着白匪下令宣布解散学联，强迫学校提前放假。驻入学校的匪军，捣毁了学校。白匪还不放心，更派出所谓“青年工作团”团员，渗入到学生群众中作破坏工作。因为处境一天比一天恶劣，学联只好再转入地下活动，发起保产护校运动，一面用个别说服和座谈讨论的方法，争取教师和同学留校，一面深入到广大的群众中去，开办民众学校、妇女识字班、工人夜校和人民群众紧紧地靠拢在一起。当时留校学生的伙食十分困难，学联便提倡互助运动，各校也利用舞蹈会、演奏会等方式，来捐款办出一部分的伙食。同时发起劳动生产，自己煮饭、挑水、种菜、喂猪，用亲密的团结，抵抗国民党匪帮的迫害。就这样，学联团结着留下来的学生们，艰苦支持一直到解放的来临。
    和平解放长沙的消息传出后，学联就和工会联合会、妇女联合会等共同发起成立迎接解放军的筹备会，准备欢迎。三日早晨，成千的男女学生，在千灯万彩中，齐集在小吴门口，解放军来了，掌声、喊声、欢笑声、鞭炮声、锣鼓声，震天动地。大家尽情地唱，尽情地舞，多年的枷锁挣脱了，他们真说不出的轻松和愉快。全体学生展开了广泛的宣传工作，漫画、歌舞、活报等每日出现在街头。他们向市民讲解目前形势和中国共产党的各项政策，揭穿白匪在长沙的残暴行为。接着，劳军运动火热地展开了，同学们挑着自己种的菜，喂的肥猪，喂的鲜鱼，节食的白米，义卖和捐募所得的银钱物品，献给自己敬爱的英勇的人民解放军。毛主席的母校湖南省立第一师范的学生和工友们，从伙食中节省下白米二石，盐一斤，和自己种的东瓜两担，由七个工友学生挑着，亲自送给解放军，许多学生自愿为解放军洗、缝衣服，并举行慰劳会，在和解放军接触中，他们诚心诚意地学习着为人民服务的精神。
