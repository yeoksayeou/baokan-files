　　Domestic Products Sufficient for National Needs
  　Ban on Import of Cigarette Paper and Tinfoil
  　North China and East China Adopt Unified Action
    [Tianjin News] According to the suggestion of the Tianjin Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce, the North China Foreign Trade Administration has determined that domestic production of cigarette paper is sufficient for demand, and tinfoil is also not a necessity. It has been approved by the Industry and Commerce Department of the North China People's Government to ban the import of cigarette paper and tinfoil. The bureau recently obtained the consent of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce, and the East China region will also take unified action. Since the liberation of Shanghai, the output of cigarette paper from the Shanghai Minfeng Paper Mill has been sufficient for national needs. To save foreign exchange expenditures, the bureau has taken this measure.
