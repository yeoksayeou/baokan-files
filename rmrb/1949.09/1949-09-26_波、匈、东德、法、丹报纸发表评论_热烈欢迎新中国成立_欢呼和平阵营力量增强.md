Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 24th: According to the Polish Press Agency, Warsaw, 23rd, Polish newspapers have been commenting on the convening of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. "Increased by 450 Million People" - this is the title of an article published on the front page of *Warsaw* newspaper, commenting on the announcement of the establishment of the new People's Republic of China government. The newspaper said that this has opened a new era in Chinese history. The victory of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the announcement of the founding of the People's Republic of China symbolize that American capital has nothing more to say about vast China, and will never have anything to say again. The victory of People's China symbolizes that 450 million people are no longer a potential market and target for foreign exploitation. The peace camp has now increased by 450 million Chinese people, and its strength has been enhanced by the addition of the independence and creativity of the new regime. Even if Chiang Kai-shek still holds Taiwan, the final victory of the Chinese people is approaching. It will be the greatest event of the twentieth century after the October Revolution in the Soviet Union and the elimination of Hitler's fascism.

The front-page editorial of *People's Forum* commented on the announcement of the founding of the People's Republic of China, saying: The billions of dollars spent by American imperialists have proven useless. The transportation of large quantities of weapons and ammunition, the assistance of American military experts, and the direct armed intervention of the United States have also proven ineffective. 450 million Chinese people have now joined the ranks of free countries. The foundation of a truly free and independent China is being laid in Beiping. However, although American and British imperialists have suffered a disastrous defeat in China, they are still attempting to play tricks on China on the international stage: they are using Kuomintang representatives in the United Nations, using Chiang Kai-shek to create a Pacific group, and the United States Congress is allocating funds to the Kuomintang. But these are all desperate attempts to blackmail the Chinese people and deceive public opinion at home and abroad. The newspaper concluded by saying: Imperialism has suffered the most painful defeat in China that the world's reactionary forces have suffered since the Soviet Union defeated Hitler. The People's Republic of China is another gap in the capitalist and imperialist front. Following the Soviet Union, which established the world's first socialist country, and following the people's democratic countries that are building the foundations of socialism, the People's Republic of China is embarking on the same path. The forces of socialism are advancing irresistibly, and the forces of capitalism are retreating once again.

*Polska Zbrojna*, in its front-page editorial entitled "The Great Day of People's China," wrote: What determined the final victory of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, thereby enabling the People's Republic of China to be proclaimed, was not only the great offensive power of the people's troops, but also the great slogans that the victorious troops of the Chinese People's Liberation Army brought to the people, the slogan of freedom and sovereignty, the slogan of democracy and peace, the internationalist slogan shared by the entire democratic camp. These slogans guaranteed the victory of People's China, and these slogans are the slogans that People's China will adhere to unswervingly. The newspaper continued: The Chinese people realize that the imperialists and the Kuomintang remnants will not be reconciled and will attempt to snatch the fruits of the Chinese people's victory. The newspaper concluded by saying: But the alliance between People's China and the Soviet Union, the people's democratic countries, and the entire peace camp guarantees that the fruits of the People's Republic of China's victory will not be allowed to be snatched away, and that it will be able to begin democratic construction and create a better future for the Chinese people.

*Farmers' Newspaper* widely commented on the announcement of the founding of the People's Republic of China. Its concluding remarks stated: "The progressive masses all over the world congratulate the birth of the People's Republic of China, because they recognize that in the liberated China, the banner for peace and social justice is flying solemnly."

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 25th: The news of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference continues to attract great attention around the world. In Budapest, the Hungarian Workers' Party's newspaper *Free People* published the full text of Chairman Mao's opening speech and the news of the CPPCC meeting on the entire first page in addition to the editorial position, even though the news of the trial of the Rajk traitorous gang has occupied the entire first page and most of the other seven pages in recent days. The Danish Communist Party's newspaper *Land og Folk* published an abstract of Chairman Mao's speech in the most prominent position on the first page on the 22nd, and published photos of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu in the middle of the page. The Berlin Soviet Zone Radio commented on Chairman Mao's announcement of the birth of the People's Republic of China on the 23rd, saying: The announcement of the People's Republic of China has attracted great attention in international political circles. The Paris press pointed out that the establishment of the new Chinese regime is a huge event of world significance, and even the United Nations General Assembly cannot but be affected by it.

　　波、匈、东德、法、丹报纸发表评论
  　热烈欢迎新中国成立     
    欢呼和平阵营力量增强
    【新华社北平二十四日电】据波兰通讯社华沙二十三日讯，波兰各报纷纷评论中国人民政治协商会议的召开。“增加了四万万五千万人”——这是华沙报首版刊载的一篇专论新人民中国政府宣告成立的文章的题目。该报说，这揭开了中国历史上的新时代。中国人民军的胜利和中华人民共和国的宣告成立，象征着美国资本对辽阔的中国已无话可说，而且将永远再没有话可说。人民中国的胜利，象征着四万万五千万人民不再是外国剥削的潜在市场和对象。和平阵营现在增加了四万万五千万中国人，其力量已因添加了新政权的独立与创造力而增强了。即令蒋介石仍据守台湾，中国人民的最后胜利是迫近了。它将是苏联十月革命和消灭希特勒法西斯主义以后二十世纪的最大事件。
    人民论坛报首版社论评论中华人民共和国的宣告成立称：美帝国主义者花费的数十亿美元，已证明毫无效用，运送大量的武器与弹药，美国军事专家的援助及美国的直接武装干涉，也证明无济于事。四万万五千万中国人现在参加了自由国家的队伍。真正自由与独立的中国的基础，正在北平奠定。然而，美英帝国主义尽管已在中国遭受灾难性的失败，他们仍企图在国际舞台上玩弄关于中国的把戏：他们在联合国中利用国民党代表，利用蒋介石制造太平洋集团，美国国会拨款给国民党。但是，这些都是敲诈中国人民和欺骗国内外舆论的绝望的企图。该报在结语时说：帝国主义在中国遭到了自从苏联击败希特勒以来世界反动力量遭受过的最惨痛的失败。中华人民共和国是资本主义与帝国主义阵线上的又一缺口。继建立了世界上第一个社会主义国家的苏联之后，继正在建设社会主义基础的人民民主国家之后，中华人民共和国正在走上同一道路。社会主义力量不可抗拒地前进着，资本主义力量再一次向后败退着。
    波尔斯卡·兹布罗伊纳报在题为“人民中国的伟大的一天”的首版社论中写道：决定中国人民军的最后胜利，从而使得中华人民共和国得以宣告成立的，不仅是人民部队的巨大攻击力，而且还有中国人民军的胜利部队带给人民的伟大口号，自由与主权的口号，民主与和平的口号，整个民主阵营所共同的国际主义的口号。这些口号保证了人民中国的胜利，这些口号是人民中国坚守不渝的口号。该报继称：中国人民群众认识到帝国主义者和国民党残余将不会甘心，将企图抢去中国人民的胜利果实。该报结语称：但是人民中国与苏联、人民民主国家及整个和平阵营的联盟，保证了中华人民共和国将不容许胜利果实被抢去，并将能够开始民主建设，为中国人民群众创造更美好的未来。
    农民报广泛地评论中华人民共和国的宣告成立。其结束语称：“全世界的进步群众祝贺中华人民共和国的诞生，因为他们认识到在解放了的中国上空，为和平与社会正义而战的大旗在庄严地飘扬着。”
    【新华社布拉格二十五日电】中国人民政治协商会议的消息，继续引起世界各地的极大注意。在布达佩斯，二十三日的匈牙利工人党机关报“自由人民”除社论地位外第一版全版刊登毛主席的开幕词全文和人民政协开会的消息，虽然连日来审判拉伊克特务匪帮的消息占据着该报第一版的全部和其他七个版的大部地位。丹麦共产党机关报“国土与人民”二十二日于第一版最显著地位登载毛主席的演说摘要，并在该版中间刊出毛主席和朱总司令的照片。柏林苏占区广播电台二十三日评述毛主席宣布中华人民共和国的诞生说：中华人民共和国的宣布已引起国际政界的极大注意。巴黎的报界指出，新中国政权的建立是具有世界重要性的巨大事件，连联合国大会都不能不受其影响。
