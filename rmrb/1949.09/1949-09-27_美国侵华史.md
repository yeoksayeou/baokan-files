    III. The Struggle for Hegemony in China (Continued from XXIII)
    In reality, during the period from 1937 to 1941, the United States continued to supply Japan with large quantities of military supplies under the "cash and carry" act. In 1938, American exports of war materials to Japan accounted for 92 percent of Japan's total consumption (Note: Xie Renzhao, previous book, p. 36.). The U.S. also helped Japan improve its shipbuilding technology and establish modern oil and aluminum industries (Note: Yin Guang: "The American Reactionaries Supported the Japanese寇," People's Daily, September 21, 1946.), earning a profit from arms sales. The so-called "moral embargo" and "Export Control Act" were merely propaganda, while at the same time, the U.S. extended loans to Chiang Kai-shek eight times, providing a total of $297 million (the Sino-American "Tung Oil" loan of $25 million, the Sino-American Credit Loan of $12.8 million, the Sino-American Flying Machine Company loan of $15 million, the Sino-American "Yunnan Tin" loan of $20 million, the Sino-American "Tungsten" loan of $25 million, a new Sino-American loan of $100 million, a credit loan of $50 million, and a Sino-American Exchange Stabilization Fund loan of $50 million), and dispatched a large number of American "experts" such as Rademao A, Krigler, Gibeiga, Arshutein, Ashayangke, and Fox... to participate in Chiang Kai-shek's political, military, aviation, railway, transportation, finance, and currency exchange departments (Note: Ishihama Tomoyuki: "Theory of the Wartime System in Chongqing," the names are transliterated from Japanese and may not be accurate), to prevent Chiang Kai-shek from surrendering to Japan, taking the opportunity to obtain more Chinese privileges from Chiang, such as squeezing out the British, enjoying the exclusive right to manage Chinese currency, operating aircraft assembly plants near Xikang and Kunming, establishing airports in southwestern China, building the Yunnan-Burma Railway, and even the privilege of "reviewing Chiang Kai-shek's military strategy" (Note: Ibid.). The longer China fought with Japan, the more profits and privileges the United States obtained from Japan and China, which in turn made the United States stronger, Japan weaker, and the remaining forces of Britain and France were eliminated, so that the United States could achieve the goal of monopolizing China with minimal sacrifice.

    However, after the Chinese people had resisted Japan for four years, and when further Japanese advances in China would be detrimental to the United States, the United States began secret activities to "adjust U.S.-Japan relations" at the expense of China's resistance. As early as around December 1940, Bishop Ursche of the American Catholic Maryknoll College, Secretary-General Don Laffer, and U.S. Postmaster General Uka secretly contacted Colonel Iwabane of the Japanese Army Ministry's Military Affairs Bureau and Tadao Igawa. By April 1941, this contact gradually matured and turned into secret negotiations between President Roosevelt, Secretary of State Hull, and Japanese Ambassador to the United States Nomura. On April 8, Hull proposed a draft "U.S.-Japan Understanding" that stipulated the following regarding the China issue:

    "The President of the United States, in order to guarantee that the Japanese government obtains the following conditions, advises the 'Chiang regime' (Note: quotation marks as in the original) to make peace based on the following conditions: A. Chinese independence (?); B. The withdrawal of Japanese troops from Chinese territory in accordance with the agreement established between China and Japan; C. No annexation of China; D. No demand for reparations; E. Restoration of the Open Door Policy; F. Merger of the 'Chiang government' and the 'Wang government' (!); G. Japan independently restricts large-scale or group immigration to China; H. Recognition of Manchuria (!). When the 'Chiang regime' accepts the advice of the U.S. President, the Japanese government will regard the regime as establishing a unified new Chinese government..." (Note: Konoe Fumimaro, translated by Sun Shizhai: "Inside Story of U.S.-Japan Diplomacy," International Culture Service, pp. 12-13.)

    三  争夺中国霸权　（续二十三）
    实际上一九三七到四一年期间，美国在“现购”“自运”法案下还是继续供给日本大批军火，一九三八年美国输日作战物资竟占日本全部消耗额的百分之九十二（注：谢仁钊前书，三六页。），又帮助日本改良造船技术，和建立现代化的石油、制铝工业（注：尹光：美国反动派扶植日寇，三十五年九月二十一日人民日报。）等，取得一笔军火利润。所谓“道义禁运”与“出口统制法”仅是一种宣传资料，而对蒋介石又同时作各种借款八次，供给二万万九千七百万美金的款额（中美“桐油”借款二千五百万，中美信用借款一千二百八十万，中美飞行机公司借款一千五百万，中美“滇锡”借款二千万，中美“汤格斯坦”借款二千五百万，中美新借款一万万，又信用贷款五千万，中美平准基金贷款五千万），及派遣大批美国“专家”如拉德毛阿、克利格勒、吉别迦、阿尔修太茵、阿沙洋克、佛克斯……等人，参加蒋介石的政治、军事、航空、铁路、交通、运输、财政、货币汇兑各部门工作（注：石滨知行：重庆战时体制论，各人均系从日文转译，恐音不甚准确），维持蒋介石不致对日投降，乘机从蒋手中取得更多的中国特权，如把英国排挤下去，享有中国货币管理独占权，及西康、昆明附近飞机组成工厂经营权，西南各地飞机场设立权，滇缅铁路敷设权，以至“检阅蒋介石的军事战略”（注：同前书）特权等等。中国与日本打得越久，美国从日本与中国取得的利润和特权越多，也就使美国力量越大，日本力量越小，英法等国残余势力越被排除净尽，最后美国可以最低限度的牺牲达到独占中国目的。
    但当中国人民抗日已经四年，日本在中国再进又将对美国不利的时候，美国就开始了牺牲中国抗战的“调整美日邦交”秘密活动，先于一九四○年十二月左右，由美国天主教美利诺尔学院主教乌尔歇，事务总长唐拉幅特，及美政府邮政部长乌卡等人，与日本陆军省军务局的岩畔大佐，井川忠雄等秘密接洽。至一九四一年四月这种接洽逐渐成熟，变为罗斯福总统赫尔国务卿与日本驻美大使野村的秘密谈判，四月八日赫尔提出一个“日美谅解方案”的试案，对中国问题作了这样的规定：
    “美国总统承认左例条件并使日本政府获得保障起见，对‘蒋政权’（按：引号为原有，下同）根据左例条件劝告和平：甲，中国独立（？）；乙，根据中日间成立之协定，日本军队自中国领土撤退；丙，不并吞中国；丁，不要求赔款；戊，恢复门户开放方针；己，‘蒋政府’与‘汪政府’合并（！）；庚，日本自行限制向中国大量或集团移民；辛，承认满洲国（！）。当‘蒋政权’接受美总统之劝告后，日本政府则认为该政权为树立统一之新中国政府……。”（驻：近卫文磨著孙识斋译：日美外交内幕，国际文化服务社版，一二——一三页。）
