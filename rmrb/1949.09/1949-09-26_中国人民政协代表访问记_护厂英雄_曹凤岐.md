A Record of Visits with Representatives to the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference: Heroic Factory Protector Cao Fengqi
Guo Yong

This heroic factory protector appeared in China's steel capital—Anshan Iron and Steel Plant. His name is Cao Fengqi. He is one of the specially invited representatives to this People's Political Consultative Conference.

He is from Wendeng County, Shandong Province. At the age of eleven, his family had nothing to eat, so he started herding sheep. He couldn't get enough to eat or wear warm clothes. He had to endure wind and rain, not to mention the beatings and scolding from the boss. He was determined to learn a skill, just asking for a place indoors during wind and rain, a little food, and no beatings. After herding sheep for a year, he ran away to the city to wander. A twelve-year-old child, new to the city, couldn't even find a place to sleep. Fortunately, he met a cook working in a store who helped him find a job in the store doing things like wiping tables, washing dishes, sweeping the floor, and carrying water. He did this for five years. Later, he worked as a dock worker and power plant worker in Weihaiwei, Dalian, and Anshan for a total of twenty-four years, until "August 15th" [end of WWII].

The Soviet Red Army arrived, and the people of Northeast China were liberated. The working class also stood up. Everyone was concerned about the factory starting up again. But Lao Cao had the closest relationship with the factory. He had lived in the factory for more than ten years, always keeping an eye on it and worrying about everything in it. He always carried a small knife to deal with people who tried to damage the factory.

One day, more than a dozen Japanese devils secretly carried more than twenty small transformers, intending to sell them. Lao Cao discovered this and ordered them to return them honestly. They put down the machines and stood there dumbfounded. Lao Cao then took out his small knife to threaten them. Unfortunately, when Lao Cao waved his hand, the knife pierced the scalp of one of the devils. The Japanese surrounded him, trying to knock the knife out of his hand with the carrying poles. Lao Cao's right arm had one bone broken. This was terrible! Lao Cao then used his left hand to fight the devils, and they all ran away.

With the help of the Soviet Red Army, everyone was overjoyed to be liberated. Unfortunately, the Kuomintang army came to Anshan. These guys dismantled the machines and sold them for money, eating, drinking, and making merry all day long, creating chaos for more than a year. Last January, our army attacked Anshan. Lao Cao mobilized the workers to protect the factory, saying, "We can't let them destroy it! We depend on the machines for our livelihood!" At this time, most of the workers were forced to repair the airport, leaving only sixty or so people in the entire refractory material factory. They formed a factory protection team, and Lao Cao became the squad leader.

When the People's Liberation Army approached the city, the Kuomintang began to suppress the workers by force, trying to drive the factory protectors out of the factory, even shooting and killing two workers. Lao Cao was beaten with countless rifle butts.

The factory protection team was scattered, leaving only seven people in the factory. "The machines are our lives!" Lao Cao often said. He was determined to protect the factory at all costs, even if it meant dying in the factory. Gunfire and artillery sounded around the factory. Lao Cao knew the People's Liberation Army was coming and was so excited he couldn't sit still. He heard the Kuomintang officers supervising the battle: "Damn it, whoever doesn't move forward will be shot!" At night, Lao Cao led the People's Liberation Army in, pointing out all the bunkers. More than 10,000 "Nationalist troops" and all their weapons became spoils of war. It was snowing heavily, and the lower half of his cotton pants were soaked, but he didn't even notice.

As soon as liberation came, before order was established, special agents and thieves came to the factory warehouses to steal. Lao Cao stopped them and explained, "The People's Liberation Army is not like the Kuomintang. The People's Liberation Army is here, and work will start soon!" Lao Cao and the other six or seven people were very determined, guarding the factory day and night in various locations, catching thieves. He himself didn't sleep for many nights and couldn't relax during the day, only able to squeeze in a nap when he could.

One night, Lao Cao went out to catch thieves and unexpectedly ran into more than thirty people, carrying machines and gasoline. He couldn't clearly see what they were stealing. When the thieves saw someone coming, they grunted. The thirty or so people put down what they were stealing, and two of them questioned Lao Cao. Lao Cao pretended to be a regular citizen, making a few polite remarks, hoping to return to the factory to get people to deal with them. However, two of the thieves recognized Lao Cao and surrounded him, knocking him to the ground. One guy砍向 his head with a carrying pole. He didn't make a sound, just rolled back and forth a few times. Then the carrying pole landed on his head five more times. He couldn't move, but he was still conscious. After beating him for a while, the thieves chattered among themselves, with some saying, "He's dead, let's throw him in the water cellar!" Others said, "Let's feed him to the dogs!" Probably the leader said, "No one's around. Never mind him. Let's go."

Lao Cao was still conscious, but he couldn't shout or get up. There was nothing he could do. After about an hour, he tried to crawl up. Blood was flowing from his head. He slowly tried to sit up, and eventually he was able to stand. He struggled to walk back to where he lived. He fell eight times in less than half a kilometer.

The six factory protectors were searching everywhere for Lao Cao. Not finding him, five of them split up into five groups to look. Lao Cao stumbled home, and as soon as he entered, one of the comrades shouted, "Oh! My God!" He was shocked to see a bloody figure entering. This shout brought the army from the factory running over. A group of people treated him, using four packets of tooth powder but couldn't stop the bleeding. One worker got anxious and tore open his new cotton coat, using the cotton to wrap the wound. Later, he was taken to the People's Liberation Army hospital, where the doctors treated him with the best medicine. The mayor, military commander, and factory director often came to visit him. The comrades told him, "We will definitely avenge you."

Lao Cao was injured, but his confidence in protecting the factory was not defeated. After his injuries healed, he was still as active as ever. When he had time, he would go to the junk market in Bajiazi to see if anyone was selling stolen goods from the steel plant. Sure enough, he caught a thief and recovered some iron plates.

Because he was always worried, he often saw thieves. Sometimes, when he saw that he couldn't resist them, he would quietly follow them, secretly memorizing the thieves' route. After liberation, he was selected as a first-class factory protection hero five times: July 3rd, July 7th, and July 9th of last year, and July 7th and July 9th of this year.

Everyone supported him as the squad leader of the factory protection team, and they supported him as a first-class hero for a long time. This year, he was transferred from the refractory material factory to the first warehouse and was elected as the chairman of the first warehouse's trade union. This time, he was specially invited to be a representative to the People's Political Consultative Conference. He didn't expect it, he said, "The factory is the workers' home, the machines are the workers' lives, and protecting the factory is our duty. I feel it's worth dying for protecting the factory. But I never dreamed that I would be able to see Chairman Mao and witness the founding of the new nation." (Attached photo)

　　中国人民政协代表访问记　护厂英雄　曹凤岐
    国涌
    这位护厂英雄，出现在中国的钢都——鞍山钢铁厂，他的名字叫曹凤岐。是这次人民政协的特邀代表之一。
    他是山东省文登县人，十一岁上，家里没吃的，就开始放羊，吃不饱，穿不暖，风吹雨打不用说，尤其受不住的是掌柜的打骂。他下决心想学手艺，只要求刮风下雨在屋里，给点吃，不挨打就行。放了一年羊，就跑到城里流浪，一个十二岁的孩子，到城里，人地两生，连个睡觉的地方都找不到。穷人见了穷人亲，幸好碰见一个在商店做饭的大司务，就替他想办法在商店找了个抹桌、洗碗筷、扫地、提水的差使，他一直干了五年。后来在威海卫、大连、鞍山，当码头工人，发电厂工人，一共干了二十四年，一直到“八一五”。
    苏联红军来到了，东北人民都得到了解放，工人阶级也从此翻身了，大家都关心着工厂的开工。但老曹和工厂的关系最密切，他十多年来在厂子里住，两只眼睛时常瞅着这厂子，为厂子的一切东西操心。他身上时常带着一把小刀子，专对付破坏厂子的人。
    有一天，十多个日本鬼子，偷偷地抬着二十多个小变电机想去出卖，被老曹发觉了，要他们老老实实送了回去，他们放下机器都呆住不动了。老曹就拿出小刀子来威胁他们。很不巧，老曹的手一挥，小刀子就从一个鬼子的脑皮上穿了过去，日本人把他包围了，用抬东西的杠子想打掉老曹手里的刀子，老曹的右胳膊就被打折一支骨头。这还得了，老曹又用左手来对付鬼子，鬼子都跑掉了。
    在苏联红军的帮助下，大家欢天喜地的得到了解放，不幸，国民党的军队来到鞍山，这些家伙来到鞍山一个个拆机器卖钱，成天吃喝玩乐，乌烟瘴气，糟塌了一年多。去年一月，咱们军队打鞍山，老曹动员工友护厂，“不能让他们破坏呀，咱们就指机器吃饭的呀！”这时，大部工人被押去修飞机场，整个耐火材料厂里只留下有六十多个人，就成立了护厂队，老曹当分队长。
    当解放军兵临城下的时候，国民党就开始武装镇压工人，要把这些护厂的人赶出厂去，竟开枪打死两个工人。老曹挨了无数枪把子。
    护厂队被打散了，厂里只剩下了七个人。“机器是我们的命呀！”老曹时常这样念叨，他有决心，拼命护厂，要死也死在厂里。枪炮在厂子周围响起来了，老曹知道解放军要来了，高兴的坐立不安。只听见国民党的军官在督战：“奶奶的，谁不往前走打死谁！”夜里，老曹把人民解放军引进来了，一个个的堡垒都指点过了，一万多“国军”和所有的武器，都成了胜利品。下着大雪，把他下半节棉裤都湿透了，他还没觉得。
    刚一解放，秩序还没有安定下来，特务分子和小偷都来工厂仓库偷盗，老曹一面制止，一面解释，“解放军不和国民党一样，解放军来了，马上就要开工的呀！”老曹他们六七个人，十分坚决，白天黑夜，分在各处，护厂抓贼，他自己好多黑夜没睡觉，白天也不放心，只能抽空挤挤眼。
    有天晚上，老曹出外捉贼，没提防一下碰住三十多个人，抬的扛的，有机器、有汽油，也看不清偷的是些什么。偷东西的人，一见有人来了。就“哼”了一声，三十多人，将所偷东西就一齐放下，有两人就来盘问老曹，老曹装作老百姓，应酬几句，想返回厂去找人来办理这伙人。偏偏有两个人说认得老曹，说话间就把老曹围起来，打倒在地上。有一个家伙，用扁担向他头上砍来，他也没啃气，只来回翻滚了几下。然后连着又有五次，扁担落在头上。他浑身不能动了，心里可还清楚。这些家伙打了一阵之后，就七嘴八舌的有说：“死了，扔在水窖里吧！”有的说：“喂了狗吧！”大概是个领头的说：“四处没人。不管他。快走。”
    老曹心里仍然很清楚，只是喊不出来，起不得来，没有一点办法。过了约一个钟头，他试着往起爬。头上的血，一直往下流。慢慢地试着往起坐，后来能够立起来，就挣扎着往自己住的地方走。不到一里地，就摔了八跤。
    厂里的六个护厂队员，东找西寻，不见老曹，就五人分出五股寻找。老曹摸到家里，刚一进门，一个同志就：“噢！我的妈呀！”看见进来个血人，大吃一惊。这一叫，场里的军队也跑来了。一伙人为他医治，四包牙粉也没堵住血。一位工人着了急，把自己新棉衣就撕开了，这才用棉花裹住。后来到了解放军医院，医生用着最好的药给医治；市长、军长、厂长经常来慰问。同志们对他说：“我们一定为你报仇。”
    老曹身上受了伤，护厂的信心可没打倒，伤好以后，还是那样积极。他没事就到八家子一带的破烂市溜＠，查找是否有人盗卖钢厂的东西，果然，他这样作，查住一个小偷，追出了一部分铁板来。    因为他时常操心，就常见偷东西的人，有时看见抵挡不过，就背后悄悄跟上，把盗贼的去路暗暗记在心里。解放后去年七月三号，七月七号，九号，今年七七，七九，五次被选为一等护厂功臣。
    大家拥护他当护厂队分队，拥护他长当一等功臣，今年他从耐火材料厂调到第一仓库，又当选第一仓库的工会主任。这次被特邀作政协代表。他没想到，他说：“工厂是工人的家，机器是工人的命，护厂是应当的呀，我觉得为护厂死也值得。可是我作梦也没想到还能见到毛主席，还能见到新国家的成立”。（附图片）
