　　Shijiazhuang People's Bank
　  Opens Inter-port Import Advance Payment
　  Maximum Advance Limit is 25 Million
    [Shijiazhuang Electric] The Shijiazhuang Branch of the People's Bank of China and the Tianjin Bank of China have reached an agreement to begin handling inter-port import advance payments. The advance payment amount is tentatively set at no more than 25 million per transaction. Shijiazhuang, as a transportation hub in North China, has always been a distribution center for local products (pig bristles, fur, etc.) from the surrounding vast rural areas. The establishment of inter-port import advance payment will greatly promote the export of local products and strengthen the exchange of materials between domestic and foreign markets, which will play a certain role in the economic construction of Shijiazhuang. The Tianjin Bank of China is the main bank for this advance payment, and the Shijiazhuang Branch is the agent bank. Manufacturers who come to Shijiazhuang to purchase local products must fill out a commercial purchase certificate and application form at the Tianjin Bank of China, obtain a purchase certificate, and pay a 40% deposit (interest is given according to current deposit rates) or a 70% collateral. Then, they can take the certificate to the Shijiazhuang Branch to withdraw funds to purchase local products. After the goods arrive in Tianjin, the payment for the goods is returned to the Tianjin Bank of China. Packing loans and other cargo packaging exports are then converted into export advance payments.
    [Another News] In order to promote the exchange of materials between various regions and facilitate business travelers, the Shijiazhuang Branch of the People's Bank of China continues to expand the clearing area with the rapid expansion of the liberated areas. It has now cleared with Hefei; an agreement has been reached with the Lanzhou People's Bank, and an agreement is being negotiated with Fuzhou. Clearing between the two places will be available soon.
