Widely Adopt the Business Method of "Product Exchange"
    Hu Youmeng
    "Product exchange" is a business method that should be widely promoted and adopted between state-owned enterprises and cooperative enterprises.
    　　　　Irrational Phenomena in Production and Sales
    Since the liberation of Tianjin and Beijing, economic construction has become the focus of work in North China. Although there have been many achievements in the past six months, there are still serious irrational phenomena. For example, in the past, the Yangquan Coal Mine had a large backlog of coal that could not be sold, making it impossible to buy back grain to ensure actual wages, while the masses in the Central Hebei Plain were severely short of fuel, to the point that some were burning wood, fertilizer (oil cake), and feed. Cooperatives at all levels were unable to regulate supply due to lack of funds, while the Shide Railway Bureau felt there was nothing to transport. Many local factories lacked capital and raw materials, but the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant was afraid that its products would not sell, and dared not start its three major furnaces of 250 tons, 380 tons, and 600 tons, which in turn affected the production of the Xuanhua Longyan Iron Mine. In addition, tens of thousands of "mother machines" in North China felt they had nothing to do... (These situations are being gradually planned to be overcome). Thus, on the one hand, production departments suffer from a lack of sales channels, and on the other hand, the needs of consumers and producers cannot be met. All economic departments are crying out for insufficient funds and difficulties in turnover. The basic reasons for these problems are the low purchasing power of farmers and the lack of unified planning and coordination among our departments, which greatly affects industrial and agricultural production.
    　　　　Developing "Product Exchange" Operations
    In order to overcome the above-mentioned irrational phenomena, we must strengthen the long-term overall planning and unified and centralized leadership of economic construction in the future, and the "product exchange" method should become the best way for state-owned enterprises and cooperatives, cooperatives and their members, and cooperatives and cooperatives to trade.
    At present, this method has been gradually expanded and promoted in various places: for example, the North China General Cooperative recently exchanged 10,000 bolts of Gaoyang cloth for 4.2 million jin of corn from the Northeast General Cooperative, and also exchanged 164,743 jin of corn for mountain products (almond kernels, walnut kernels) from Huairou County. In May, the Beijing Supply and Marketing Cooperative sold 2.8 million jin of manure on credit in exchange for agricultural products in advance. The Central Hebei Supply and Marketing Cooperative once exchanged Gaoyang cloth and homespun cloth for 8.7 million jin of grain from the General Cooperatives of Jilin, Qiqihar, and other provinces and cities. The Chahar Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative exchanged 344,222 jin of medicinal materials in the four disaster-stricken counties of Longguan, Chicheng, Huairou, and Chongli, for 158,694 jin of grain to farmers. Recently, according to the needs of farmers, it ordered 10,000 chain knives from iron furnaces in Zhangjiakou and sold them to farmers on credit, to be repaid with grain in the autumn. The Taihang District Trading Company systematically entered into 28 commercial contracts with 23 units, including 10 county federations of cooperatives, 2 public stores, 7 state-owned and public factories, 2 state-owned transportation companies, and 2 friendly district trading companies and industrial companies, using methods such as ordering, barter, consignment sales, and agency purchases, accelerating the exchange of industrial and agricultural products and playing a significant role in connecting urban and rural trade.
    　　　　Several Methods of "Product Exchange"
    The so-called "product exchange" is not a simple "barter", but refers to a business method that does not go through private merchants or involves little or no cash payment, but systematically implements the principle of exchanging urban (industrial products) and rural (agricultural and local products) materials and regulating regional materials into business operations. In this business method, there are many different methods suitable for various situations. Based on existing experience, they can be summarized into the following types:
    (1) Barter - that is, exchanging raw materials, tools and other means of production or daily consumer goods for products of cooperative members. For example, exchanging a bolt of foreign cloth for a certain number of jin of fine velvet cotton, etc.
    (2) Lending in Kind and Repaying in Kind - For example, last year, the Water Conservancy Promotion Cooperative lent waterwheels and repaid with grain, and the Raoyang County Promotion Cooperative in Hebei lent wheat seeds and fertilizer last autumn and repaid with bags of saltpeter.
    (3) Advance Exchange for Agricultural Products - Also called "credit sales for advance exchange". That is, selling industrial products such as coal, kerosene, cloth, and salt on credit to farmers during the lean season, and pre-determining the quality and ratio of the physical objects to be exchanged and returned, because it has no interest and is mostly limited to repayment within the year, so it is slightly different from lending in kind and repaying in kind. The following points should be noted in this method: (1) The types of goods to be exchanged should not be too many, and a contract should be signed with relevant departments (trading companies, higher-level cooperatives, etc.) in advance to find reliable customers. (2) Members can wholesale and repay wholesale, or retail and repay retail. But it should be based on not affecting production and supply (such as grain). (3) There are three methods for stipulating the exchange price ratio: The first is to calculate according to the price ratio of the two goods at the time of credit sale, such as selling a pack of matches (ten boxes) on credit in March, equivalent to one jin of millet, and selling nine boxes of matches on credit in April, equivalent to one jin of millet, regardless of how the price of millet falls at the time of repayment, it should still be repaid according to the above number. In this way, the borrower (member or cooperative) benefits more and is protected from the harm of "cheap grain", but the lender is prone to lose money. The second is to calculate according to the price of the two goods at the time of repayment. This method cannot regulate seasonal price differences, and members benefit less. There is also a method of averaging the price ratio of the two goods at the time of delivery of industrial products and the price ratio of the two goods at the time of returning agricultural products. These methods are still to be studied.
    (4) Credit Purchase and Supply in Kind - That is, exchanging for members' products according to a certain price ratio of goods, without paying cash (credit purchase), and then supplying members with supplies regularly or monthly or quarterly. For example, after the autumn harvest, members hand in 100 jin of peanuts, which is converted into 24 jin of medium-quality kerosene (cheaper than the market or cash exchange), and it is agreed that two jin will be collected every month, and it will be finished in twelve months. In the past, in rural Hebei, farmers used to hand in a batch of oil materials to the oil mill and then collect oil for consumption in piecemeal. This can play a role in saving for farmers and ensuring that they are not affected by the scissor-shaped changes in prices, and can also subsidize capital turnover and temporary shortage of goods.
    (5) Supply of Materials for Ordering - Such as the oil mills in Shenxian and Raoyang in Hebei Province, and the plowshares in Yangcheng and Jincheng in the Taiyue District, have all adopted this method.
    (6) Offsetting Tax Payments - When the masses feel that there is a shortage of tax items, the cooperative can collect other materials from members and pay taxes on behalf of the members. For example, when collecting millet, if the members do not have it, they can hand in bristles or homespun cloth to the cooperative, which will convert it into a millet slip, and then the members will use the millet slip to offset the tax grain. In the future, the tax authorities and the cooperative will settle accounts in a unified manner.
    　　　　The Role of "Product Exchange"
    The above methods are examples of the operation of the cooperative itself, while state-owned economy and cooperatives, regional cooperatives, and upper and lower-level cooperatives can sign various types of exchange contracts on this basis. Although this is a very common business method, once it is systematically, guided, and step-by-step promoted and continuously improved in the work to create more methods, it will play the following roles:
    (1) It can guarantee the distribution of industrial products and the purchase of agricultural products, achieve preliminary planning, thereby reducing the price fluctuations that may be caused by these commodities flowing into the market.
    (2) It can make it easier to grasp the "reasonable exchange" ratio of industrial products, agricultural products, and local specialties, guarantee the interests of small producers, and attract small producers to consciously and voluntarily carry out production in accordance with the national construction plan (such as the "Guarantee that one jin of peanuts will be converted into five jin of rice after autumn, and one jin of cotton will be converted into eight to ten jin of rice. If the market price exceeds this number, the trading company will purchase it at the market price" promulgated by the North China government this spring).
    (3) It can provide subsidies and adjustments to the weak purchasing power of small producers, enabling them to obtain means of production and livelihood in advance without cash, and adjust seasonal high price differences (in the past, after the agricultural harvest, agricultural products were cheap, and industrial products were expensive).
    (4) It can greatly save the capital of cooperatives and state-owned economic departments, with one set of capital playing several roles. For example, recently, the Chahar Provincial Trading Company delivered 20,000 bolts of small homespun cloth to the Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative, which exchanged it for flax in advance in the counties of northern Chahar. This solves the problem of clothing for farmers who have no purchasing power, and also guarantees the purchase task of oil flax. At the same time, it also solves the sales problem of homespun cloth and the transportation and sales problem of agricultural products for the trading company. It also saves the funds used by the provincial, county, and district supply and marketing cooperatives and helps the development of cooperative organizations. It is a good way to achieve multiple goals with one move.
    In order to ensure close relations between various economic departments and between them and the members, it is also necessary to establish a strict credit system, and "commercial contract" is the best form of this credit system and a strong guarantee for "product exchange". However, after the contract is signed, it is also necessary to organize and establish a special commercial arbitration body common to all levels and economic departments (under the leadership of the government's Financial and Economic Committee) to resolve daily disputes in a timely manner, overcome the past problems of delays, and create prejudice between departments and such errors as "rather deal with private merchants than cooperate with state-owned enterprises."

　　广泛采用“产品交换”的经营方式
    胡友孟
    “产品交换”是目前国营企业与合作企业之间应广泛加以提倡采用的一种经营方式。
    　　　　产销中的不合理现象
    平津解放以来，经济建设成为华北的工作重心，半年来虽有不少建树，但还严重的存在着不合理的现象。如过去阳泉煤矿堆有大批煤炭，卖不出去，不能买回粮食保证实际薪资，而冀中平原的群众则燃料奇缺，以致有些把木材、肥料（油饼）、饲料等都烧掉；各级合作社因为资金缺乏，不能调剂供给。而石德铁路局则感到无货可运。不少地方厂炉缺乏资本，缺乏原料，但石景山炼钢厂，却怕产品没销路，闲着二百五十吨、三百八十吨和六百吨的三大炼炉，不敢开工，联系影响了宣化龙烟铁矿的生产。此外，华北上万架的“母机”感到无活可干……（这些情况正在逐步计划克服中）。这样，一方面是生产部门苦无销路，一方面是消费者生产者的需求不能满足。各经济部门均喊资金不足，周转困难。这些问题的基本原因乃是农民购买力低下，以及我们各部门间缺乏统一的计划与联系，因而大大的影响了工业生产与农业生产。
    　　　　发展着的“产品交换”经营
    为了克服以上不合理的现象，今后必须加强经济建设中长期全盘的计划性，和统一集中的领导，而“产品交换”的方式，应成为国营企业与合作社之间、合作社与社员群众之间，以及合作社与合作社之间交易的最好方式。
    目前这种方式已在各地逐渐扩展推行：如华北总社最近以一万匹高阳布交换东北总社之四百二十万斤玉米，又以一十六万四千七百四十三斤玉米，换怀柔县的山货（杏仁、核桃仁）。北平供销总社五月份赊出二百八十万斤大粪，预换农产。冀中供销总社曾以高阳布及土布向吉林齐齐哈尔等省、市总社，交换粮食八百七十万斤。察哈尔省供销总社在龙关、赤城、怀柔、崇礼四个受灾县份换购药材三四四、二二二斤，换给农民粮食一五八、六九四斤。最近又根据农民要求，向张家口各铁炉订做了一万把链刀，赊给农民秋后还粮。太行区贸易公司则有计划的在半年中与十个县联社、两个公营商店、七个国营、公营工厂、两个国营运输公司、两个友区贸易公司和实业公司等二十三个单位，采用订货、实物交换、代销、代购等方式，订立了二十八个商业合同，加速了工农产品的交流，在沟通城乡贸易上，起到不少作用。
    　　　　“产品交换”的几种办法
    所谓“产品交换”并不是简单的“以物易物”，而是指不经过私商不经过或少经过现币支付，而将城（工业品）乡（农产土产）物资交换、地区物资调剂的原则，有计划地贯彻到业务中去的一种经营方式。在这种经营方式中，又有许多不同的适合各种情况的办法。根据现有经验，归纳起来约有以下几种：
    （一）实物交换——即以原料、工具等生产资料或日用消费品，交换社员群众产品。如一匹洋布换若干斤细绒皮棉等。
    （二）贷实还实——如去年水利推进社，贷水车还粮食，河北饶阳县推进社，去秋贷麦种肥料，还口袋火硝。
    （三）预换农产——或叫“赊卖预换”。即将现有之煤炭、煤油、布匹、食盐等工业品，于青黄不接季节赊给农民，预先订好交换归还之实物质量及比率，因为它没利息，并多限制在本年之内归还，所以与贷实还实，稍有区别。这种办法须注意以下几点：（１）交换的物品种类，不宜过多，并应事先与有关部门（贸易公司、上级社等）订好合同，找好可靠的顾主。（２）社员可整赊整还，也可零赊零还。但以不误生产和供给（如粮食）为原则。（３）交换价格比率的规定，计有三种办法：第一种是按赊货时两种物价比率计算如三月份赊火柴一包（十盒）折小米一斤，四月份赊火柴九盒折小米一斤，不管归还时小米怎样跌价，仍照上数归还。这样，赊户（社员或社）得益多，免受“谷贱”之害，但赊主容易赔钱。第二种是按还赊时两物价格计算。这办法不能调节季节性物价差额，社员得益少，还有一种是按交付工业品时两物之比价与交还农产品时两物之比价平均作价。这些办法都尚待研究。
    （四）赊买供实——即照一定物品比价换取了社员产品，不付现货（赊买），以后定期或按月按季供给社员用品。如秋收后社员交花生一百斤，折成中等煤油二十四斤（比市上或现换要便宜），说好每月领取二斤，十二个月领完为止。过去在河北农村中，曾有农民向油坊交一批油料，然后零星领油食用的情形。这样可以起代农民储蓄，并保证不受物价剪刀形变化影响的作用，又可补助资金周转及临时货少的困难。
    （五）供料订货——如河北省深县饶阳的油坊，太岳区阳城晋城的犁面，都曾采用过这种办法。
    （六）抵交税款——在群众对征税物类感到缺乏时，合作社可收社员其他物资，而代社员交税。如征谷子时，社员没有，则可以猪鬃或土布等交到社内，由合作社折价开谷条，再由社员持谷条抵交税粮，将来征税机关与合作社统一算帐。
    　　　　“产品交换”的作用
    以上办法系就合作社本身经营时举例说明，而国营经济与合作社之间，地区合作社之间，上下级合作社之间，则可在此基础上订立各种各类的交换合同，这样虽是很平常的经营方式，但一经有计划有领导有步骤地普遍推行起来，并在工作中不断改进，创造更多的办法，它将起以下几种作用：
    （一）可保证工业品的分配与农产品的收购，做到初步的计划性，从而减少这些商品流入市场的可能引起的物价波动。
    （二）可以使工业品、农产品及各地特产的“合理交换”比率，易于掌握，保证小生产者的利益，吸引小生产者自觉自愿地按照国家建设计划进行生产（如今春华北政府颁布了“秋后保证花生一斤折米五斤，皮棉一斤折米八斤到十斤，如市价超过此数时，由贸易公司按市价收购”的办法）。
    （三）可对小生产者薄弱的购买力给以补助调剂，使他们不用现款，而能预先得到生产和生活资料，调剂季节性的过高物价差额（过去农产收获后，农产贱，工业品就贵了）。
    （四）可大量节省合作社及国营经济部门资金，一套资本起着几种作用。如最近察哈尔省贸易公司以两万匹小土布交付该省供销总社，在察北各县预换胡麻。这样解决了无购买力农民的穿衣问题，又保证了油料胡麻的采购任务；同时也解决了贸易公司土布销路和农产品的运销问题；并节省了省、县、区供销社的使用资金；帮助合作社组织的发展，是一举数得的好办法。
    为了保证各经济部门间以及与社员群众间密切的关系，还必须建立严格的信用制度，而“商业合同”则是这种信用制度中最好的形式，也是“产品交换”的有力保证。但在合同订立之后，还应组织建立各级各经济部门共同的专门商业裁判机关（可在政府财委会领导下），以及时解决日常纠纷，克服过去问题拖延不决，以致造成部门间的成见与“宁与私商来往，不与国营合作能商”等错误。
