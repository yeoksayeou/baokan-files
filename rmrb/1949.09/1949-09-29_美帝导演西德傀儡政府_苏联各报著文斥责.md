Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 27th: TASS reports: Soviet newspapers have been commenting for days on the farce of the establishment of the West German puppet government. The commentator Malinin in *Pravda* pointed out: The majority faction in the Bonn Parliament is nothing more than a group of Quislings who, although speaking German, completely follow the notorious "democratic" practices from across the Atlantic and are rewarded with American dollars. The West German state is not the state of the German people, but an American garden under the control of occupation regulations, the purpose of which is to turn West Germany into a strategic springboard for the North Atlantic bloc. The divisive Bonn Parliament and Quisling government that have been established are yet another challenge to the German people, brazenly violating the rights and desires of the German people, the effort to make Germany a unified and democratic country, and the will of the German people to support peace and strive for peaceful cooperation with other countries. The commentator Munin in *Trud* pointed out that this "country" is a breeding ground for fascist reactionaries. Adenauer frankly expressed the revanchist program of German militarists. The first article of this program is to require Western countries to discuss "defense" issues with the West German state. This is a demand to rebuild the German armed forces. In West Germany, the old German military organizations are being restored under various names, and new ones are being established under various names. The second article is the issue of Germany's participation in the North Atlantic bloc. Although the American ruling group is now afraid of public opinion and dare not openly do so, Acheson has allowed Adenauer to participate in the so-called European Committee. The third article is the aggressive plan for Germany's eastern border. Adenauer's hints prove that German militarists are using the slogan of revising the eastern border to incite revanchist sentiments and war psychology in order to implement the imperialist plan to restore West Germany's war potential. *Izvestia*'s international commentary pointed out that the United States now favors the extreme right-wing parties in Germany, believing that these parties are more reliable pillars. The West German Social Democratic Party is now assigned the role of "opposition party" to help carry out this deception of the German people. An article in *New Times* stated that the United States, Britain, and France violated the agreement of the Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference, split Germany, and turned West Germany into a bridgehead in the imperialist anti-democratic gamble. *Pravda* observer Maevsky pointed out: The German people reject the colonial occupation regulations, the anti-national Bonn Constitution, and the unspeakable Bonn state. They do not recognize the American puppet group of Hughes and Adenauer as a government. The movement protesting the West German puppet government is expanding across the country.

　　美帝导演西德傀儡政府
  　苏联各报著文斥责
    【新华社北京二十七日电】塔斯社讯：苏联各报连日评论西德傀儡政府成立的滑稽戏。真理报政论家马里宁指出：波恩议会的多数派无非是一群吉斯林分子，他们嘴里虽讲的是德国话，但却完全按照大西洋彼岸臭名远扬的“民主”政治的惯例从事活动而得到美金。西德国家不是德国人民的国家，而是一个在占领法规掌握中的美国的花园，其目的在于把西德变成北大西洋集团的战略跳板。业已成立的制造分裂的波恩议会与吉斯林政府乃是对德国人民的又一次挑战，它横暴地违背了德国人民的权利、愿望和使德国成为一个统一的民主国家的努力，违背德国人民拥护和平、争取与其他国家和平合作的意志。劳动报政论家牟宁指出这个“国家”是法西斯反动派的温床，阿登纳十分坦率地表示了德国军国主义分子的复仇纲领。这一纲领的第一条就是要求西方国家与西德国家商讨“防御”问题。这就是要求重建德国武装部队。在西德，旧的德国军事组织正以各种名目在恢复，新的也正以各种名目建立。第二条就是要求德国参加北大西洋集团的问题。美国统治集团现在虽然害怕舆论还不敢公开这样做，但是艾奇逊已允许阿登纳参加所谓欧洲委员会了。第三条就是德国东部国界的侵略计划。阿登纳的暗示证明德国军国主义分子正利用修改东部国界的口号来煽起复仇情绪和战争心理，以实施帝国主义恢复西德战争潜能的计划。消息报国际述评指出：美国现在宠信德国的极端右翼政党，认为这些政党是更可靠的支柱。西德社会民主党现在被委以“反对党”的角色，以帮助进行这个对德国人民的骗局。新时代的论文称，美英法三国破坏了巴黎外长会议的协议，分裂德国并把西德转变为帝国主义反民主的赌博中的桥头阵地。真理报观察家马伊夫斯基指出：德国人民拒绝殖民地的占领法规、反民族的波恩宪法，和不堪形容的波恩国家。他们不承认休斯和阿登纳这些美国傀儡集团是一个政府。抗议西德傀儡政府的运动正在全国扩展中。
