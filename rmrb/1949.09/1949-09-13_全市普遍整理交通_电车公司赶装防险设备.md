Citywide Comprehensive Traffic Management
　　Tram Company Rushes to Install Safety Equipment
　　[This City News] Since the commencement of traffic management work, the city's Public Security Bureau, together with the CCP district committees, district public offices, trade union offices, vendors' management offices, and pickets, have organized traffic management committees. Each police station has also formed management groups, putting up slogans and distributing leaflets to promote the work. The trade union offices in the inner five districts are conducting publicity and education in workers' literacy classes and night schools. Seven student representatives from the No. 1 Municipal Middle School in the district also participated in the traffic management work during their holiday (September 11th), using blackboards and wall newspapers to promote awareness among their classmates. In addition to schools, vendors, and pedicabs being promoted by their respective supervisory units, the Outer First Precinct also held meetings with household heads to explain the importance of traffic management. The Inner Third Precinct installed loudspeakers to broadcast promotions in rotation at Beixinqiao and Dongsi Archway. The propaganda team organized by the Municipal Bureau travels daily in propaganda vehicles and broadcasting vehicles to major streets, using singing, Yangko dancing, and broadcasting to carry out publicity. In addition to educating drivers, the tram company has over forty employees who have stopped taking breaks to form a Yangko team, which rides in a decorated vehicle to cooperate with the Municipal Public Security Bureau's street propaganda work. In the past three days, most vehicles, horses, and pedestrians on the streets have been able to comply with traffic regulations and obey the instructions of traffic police. A pedicab driver near Huanghuamen said, "Yesterday I took a day off work to repair the brakes on my vehicle and also installed a light." A pedicab driver near the Dongsi tram stop said, "We will no longer solicit passengers at the tram stop, as that violates order." After publicity and explanation, eighty-three mobile vendors in the inner four districts have moved into the markets.

　　However, a small number of citizens still do not pay attention to traffic safety. On the 10th and 11th, it was discovered that Ning Zhixue, a worker at the 70th Ordnance Factory, was taking shortcuts near the west entrance of Huguo Temple; pedicab driver Zhang Jing was driving too fast, causing passenger Ning Xiaoying to fall off; citizen Chang Yongqing was racing his bicycle against a tram on Xisi North Street; and a worker from the Telecommunications Bureau was riding his bicycle in the fast lane on Xisi North Street. When the traffic police stopped them, they refused to obey and were taken to their respective police stations for persuasion and education. They were released after admitting their mistakes. In addition, at 7:00 a.m. on the 11th, a long-distance truck hit and injured Han Baolin, a handcart pusher, in front of the Qian Gulou (Front Drum Tower) Garden and fled the scene. The Inner Fifth Precinct has sent personnel to investigate.

　　[This City News] The Ping City Tram Company is rushing to install safety equipment to prevent traffic accidents and assist the government in improving urban traffic order. There were many tram accidents in July and August. In sixty-one days, there were fifty-nine accidents, resulting in one death from being run over, one death from being hit, and one injury. Although the main cause of the accidents was chaotic traffic and individual cyclists cutting in front of trams, the lack of tram safety equipment was also a contributing factor.

　　The tram's safety equipment should include a safety device, reversing device, trailer brake cable, and "人" shaped wood, in addition to the hand brake and electric brake. However, during the enemy and puppet regime, all of this equipment was removed. After liberation, only the hand brake, electric brake, and some "人" shaped wood remained on the trams. Because the bells are too old and the thickness of the brake shoes varies, they are not very responsive when used. Even if the brakes are responsive, the tram will still slide forward a considerable distance after stopping. Furthermore, because there is no trailer brake cable, the trailer will continue to push forward after the tram stops, so if someone is too close to the tram, it is impossible to prevent danger. The drivers have long requested to strengthen the safety equipment, and the temporary employee representative assembly also suggested installing a "reversing device" (which would allow the tram to reverse) at the end of June. After a tram ran over and killed someone in front of Zhongnanhai on June 30th, the drivers again proposed installing a reversing device. After the tram accident on the 27th of last month, the administration decided to actively rush to install the equipment. The "人" shaped wood and "reversing device" have now been fully installed, and the old-fashioned, fragile, and easily damaged safety devices are being improved or replaced with new ones.

　　全市普遍整理交通
　  电车公司赶装防险设备
    【本市讯】自整理交通工作开始以来，市公安局所属城郊各分局，已结合中共各区委会，区公所，工会办事处，摊贩管理处，纠察队等分别组织整理交通委员会，各派出所亦分别组织整理小组，到各街贴标语，散传单等展开宣传工作，定期着手整理、内五区工会办事处分别在工人识字班、工人夜校中进行宣传教育。该区市立第一中学学生代表七人，利用星期（十一日）休假期间，亦参加整理交通工作，并以黑板报壁报向同学进行宣传。外一分局除学校、摊贩、三轮车均由各主管单位进行宣传外，还召开各住户户长会议展开宣传解释。内三分局并按装广播器，轮流在北新桥、东四牌楼宣传广播。市局所组织之宣传队，每日均乘宣传车及广播车到各重要街衢，利用唱歌、扭秧歌、广播等进行宣传，电车公司除对司机进行教育外，并有四十余职工，停止休息时间，组织秧歌队，乘花车一辆，配合市公安局之街头宣传工作。三日以来，各街道之车马行人，大部均能遵守交通规则及听从交通警士指挥。在黄化门附近的一个三轮车夫说：“昨天我歇了一天工，把车闸修理好，还按装了一个灯。”在东四电车站附近的三轮车夫说：“我们再也不到电车站上揽客坐了，那样就违反秩序。”内四区的八十三个流动摊贩，经宣传解释后，都迁入了市场。
    但有少数市民仍不重视交通安全。十日、十一日两天，即发现在护国寺西口有七十兵工厂工友宁志学走小迂回；三轮车夫张静行车速度过快，致将乘客宁小英摔下；市民常永庆在西四北大街骑自行车与电车赛跑，电信局一工人在西四北大街骑车走快车道等，交通警士制止不服，均带至各派出所进行说服教育，经承认错误后释放。此外，十一日上午七时，一长途卡车在前鼓楼苑将推手车人韩宝林撞伤后逃逸，内五分局已派员查寻。
    【本市讯】平市电车公司赶装防险设备，以防止车祸发生，并协助政府改善城市交通秩序。七、八两月中，电车肇祸甚多，六十一天里，发生事故五十九次，先后轧毙、撞毙及撞伤各一人，肇祸的主因，虽是交通较乱，个别骑自行车的人抢路，但是电车防险设备不足，也是原因之一。
    电车的防险设备，除手闸电闸外，还应有防险机、倒字、拖车电闸线、人字木等。但在敌伪统治时期，这些设备，全部拆除。解放后，机车上只剩下手闸、电闸和一部分人字木。因为车铃过老，闸瓦的厚薄也多不一致，用时不太灵，即使闸灵，车停了还要向前滑出相当远。又因没有拖车电闸线，机车停了，拖车还要向前顶，所以一旦有人与机车距离过近，危险是无法防止的。司机们早就要求过增强防险设备，六月底临时职工代表会也曾建议按装“倒字”（倒字可使车倒行）。六月三十日电车在中南海前轧死人后，司机们又提议按装倒字。到上月二十七日电车肇祸后，行政上即决定积极赶装。现在人字木与“倒字”都已装全，并将旧式的脆弱易坏之防险机加以改良或做新的。
