　　The Position of Vegetables in Diet
    Wang Huaizhou
    Vegetables are an indispensable part of the diet. Chinese people mainly eat grains, and vegetables are relatively lacking. Many people do not understand the importance of vegetables. Here, I will briefly discuss the importance of vegetables in the diet.
    Components and Functions of Vegetables
    Vegetables contain protein, sugar (carbohydrates), fat, crude fiber, minerals, and vitamins. The quality of vegetable protein is better than that of grain protein, but the content is very small. Sugar content is also very low, except for root and stem vegetables; fat is even less important. Crude fiber is difficult to digest. Eating too much is bad for the stomach, but eating too little can easily lead to constipation. Therefore, although crude fiber has no nutritional value, it regulates bowel movements.
    Vegetables contain a wide variety of minerals, such as calcium, phosphorus, iron, magnesium, manganese, copper, potassium, sodium, and iodine. Some of these minerals are raw materials for building bones, and some play a role in physiological regulation. Calcium accounts for two percent of the human body's composition, of which 99 percent exists in bones, and a small amount exists in plasma and other body fluids. Children who lack calcium will have poor bone development. Pregnant women who lack calcium will have the fetus absorb calcium from the mother's bones, causing the mother to lose teeth early or develop rickets. Magnesium is also a component of bones. Deficiency can cause vasodilation, nervousness, or cramps. Manganese is related to the maturation of sexual organs. Iron is a component of hemoglobin. Copper helps the utilization of iron and the formation of pigments in hair and skin.
    Vegetables are an excellent source of vitamins. Vitamins have many functions. The important vitamins in vegetables include vitamin A, vitamin B1, vitamin B2, nicotinic acid, folic acid, vitamin C, and vitamin E. Vitamin A promotes normal growth. Deficiency can cause night blindness, dry eye, and eye inflammation. Vitamin C deficiency reduces intercellular adhesion, making joints, bones, muscles, and skin fragile, swollen, painful, and bleeding. In addition, it is also related to blood cell regeneration. Folic acid was first extracted from spinach and has a therapeutic effect on megaloblastic anemia. Vitamin E prevents infertility. Vitamin B1 deficiency can cause loss of appetite, and severe deficiency can cause beriberi. Vitamin B2 deficiency can cause cheilitis, conjunctival congestion, and photophobia. Nicotinic acid deficiency can cause pellagra. Mild cases cause red spots and pigmentation on the skin, and severe cases cause skin cracking and peeling.
    How to Choose Vegetables
    Since vegetables are so important to human health, they should be considered an important part of the daily diet. To obtain higher nutrition at the lowest cost, choosing vegetables is very important. Generally speaking, the more active parts of a living thing, the more vigorous the physiological functions, and the richer in minerals and vitamins, that is, the richer in nutritional value. The leaves of a plant are the organs that produce its own food, with the most vigorous physiological functions and the highest nutritional value. Also, the depth of the color of the vegetable leaves is proportional to the amount of chlorophyll. Darker colors indicate more chlorophyll, vigorous photochemical action, and more vitamins. Therefore, eating colored leafy vegetables is more nutritious.
    Nutrient content also varies between the core and outer leaves, the leaf blade and petiole, and the leaves and stems of the same vegetable. Usually, the outer leaves have a higher nutritional value than the core. For example, the outer leaves of *piāo*儿白 contain twice as much vitamin C as the core. Mustard leaves contain three to five times more iron than the petioles and veins. Garlic leaves contain five times more vitamin C than the stems, and purple cabbage moss leaves contain six times more vitamin C than the stems. The vitamin C content in snow cabbage leaves is eleven times higher than in the stems.
    Some vegetables contain oxalic acid, which is not only useless to the human body but also affects calcium absorption. Someone once did an experiment showing that the calcium in spinach cannot be used by animals because of the high oxalic acid content. If spinach is eaten with milk, the calcium in the milk will not be absorbed either. In addition to spinach, vegetables with the highest oxalic acid content include amaranth, Swiss chard, purple ginger, and bamboo shoots. Attention should be paid when choosing vegetables. How to remove oxalic acid from vegetables is a problem worth studying.
    Important Sources of Vitamin A, Vitamin C, Calcium, and Iron
    Now, here are several vegetables rich in vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium, and iron, listed in order of content for reference.
    Vegetables rich in Vitamin A:
    Carrots, red peppers, alfalfa, shepherd's purse, dandelion, broom seedlings, *goujitou*, *zhumaocai* (wild), toon sprouts, goosefoot (wild), spinach, snow cabbage, sweet potato leaves, alfalfa, *eryuelan* (wild), seaweed, celery, rapeseed, water spinach, radish leaves, bok choy, cabbage, water spinach, red amaranth, green amaranth, hyacinth bean, coriander, green bell pepper, winter squash.
    Vegetables rich in Vitamin C:
    Alfalfa, red bell pepper, alfalfa, snow cabbage, toon buds, green bell pepper, cauliflower, amaranth, kohlrabi leaves, green goat horn pepper, cabbage, radish leaves, purple cabbage moss, pea seedlings, kohlrabi, rapeseed moss, fennel, cabbage, daylily, rapeseed, *gaicai*, *taigucai*, mustard greens, garlic sprouts, lotus root, green garlic, leeks, mustard greens, water spinach, *piāo*儿菜, leek flowers, spinach.
    Vegetables rich in Calcium:
    Shepherd's purse, radish leaves, alfalfa, elm money, snow cabbage (pickled), red amaranth, green amaranth, sweet potato leaves, coriander, water celery, *taigucai*, *goujitou*, *qingmingcai* (wild), fennel, *malantou*, bitter herbs, alfalfa, toon, water spinach, cabbage, *yun dou*, bok choy, cabbage moss, *ér*菜.
    Vegetables rich in Iron:
    Elm money, alfalfa, shepherd's purse, coriander, *qingmingcai*, radish leaves, red amaranth, *taigucai*, sweet potato leaves, green amaranth, rapeseed, alfalfa, toon, *goujitou*, bitter herbs, spinach, lettuce, cabbage moss, *yun dou*.

### 蔬菜在膳食中的地位

　　蔬菜在膳食中的地位
    王淮洲
    蔬菜是膳食中不可缺的项目，而中国人的食物以谷类为主，蔬菜比较缺乏，而很多人也都没有了解蔬菜的重要性，这里简单的谈谈蔬菜在膳食中的重要性。
    蔬菜的成分与功用
    蔬菜含有蛋白质、糖（炭水化物）、脂肪、粗纤维、矿物质及维生素等。蔬菜蛋白的品质较谷类蛋白好，但含量很少。糖类物质除根茎类蔬菜外，含量也很少；脂肪更不占重要位置。粗纤维是一种不容易消化的东西，吃多了对肠胃不好，但吃得太少了，就容易发生大便秘结的现象；所以粗纤维虽然没有营养价值，却有调节大便的功用。
    蔬菜所含矿物质底种类比较多，如钙、磷、铁、镁、锰、铜、钾、钠、碘等。在这些矿物质中，有的是构成骨骼的原料，有的是司生理调节的作用。钙占人体成分的百分之二，其中百分之九十九存在在骨骼里，少量存在血浆及其他体液中，小孩缺乏钙质，则骨骼发育不良；孕妇缺少钙质，则胎儿将母亲骨骼中之钙质吸收，而使母亲牙齿早落、或成软骨病。镁也是构成骨骼的成分，缺乏时则产生血管扩张、神经过敏或抽筋现象。锰质与性器官之成熟有关。铁是组成血色素的成分。铜质可帮助铁质的利用，及毛发皮肤等色素之形成。
    蔬菜是维生素很好的来源，维生素的功用很大。蔬菜中所含维生素的种类，比较重要的有甲种维生素、乙一种维生素、乙二种维生素、烟草酸、叶酸、丙种维生素及戊种维生素等。甲种维生素可促进正常的生长，缺乏时则生夜盲症、眼干病、眼炎等。丙种维生素缺乏时则细胞内粘接物减失，使关节、骨骼、肌肉、皮肤等变脆弱、肿痛出血；此外，它与血球底复生亦有关系。叶酸最早是从菠菜中提取出，对巨细胞贫血有治疗作用。戊种维生素则有防止不妊症的功用。乙一素缺乏时轻则食欲衰退，重则发生脚气病。乙二素缺乏则生口角炎、角膜充血、怕光等现象。烟草酸缺乏则生癞皮病，轻则皮肤上有红斑及色点，重的就发生裂皮及脱屑的现象。
    应该怎样选择蔬菜
    蔬菜对人身健康既然非常重要，那么就应该当作日常重要的食物之一。为了用最低的代价而获得较高的营养，怎样挑选蔬菜是一件十分要紧的事。一般的说，凡生物愈活动的部分，生理作用愈旺盛的器官，愈富于矿质和维生素，也就是愈富于营养价值。植物的叶是制造它本身食物的器官，生理作用最旺盛，营养价值也最高。又菜叶颜色的深浅，与叶绿素之多少成比例，颜色深的，叶绿素多，光化作用旺盛，含维生素多。所以吃有色叶类菜，营养是比较好的。
    同一种蔬菜，菜心与外叶、叶身与叶柄、菜叶与菜茎所含营养素多少也不一样。通常外叶较菜心的营养价值高，如ｐｉāｏ＠①儿白外叶所含的丙素较菜心高两倍，芥菜叶身所含的铁较叶柄及叶脉高三至五倍，青蒜叶中所含丙素高于茎部五倍，紫菜苔叶中之丙素高于茎部六倍，又雪里红叶中之丙素则较茎部高十一倍。
    有些蔬菜中含有草酸，草酸对人体不但没有好处，而且可以影响钙的吸收。有人曾经作过试验，菠菜中的钙质不能为动物所利用，是由于草酸含量太高的关系；若菠菜同牛奶一齐吃，牛奶里的钙质也就不能吸收。蔬菜中含草酸最多的除菠菜外，还有苋菜、牛皮菜、紫姜、斑竹笋等，挑选蔬菜时也该加以注意。用什么方法把蔬菜中的草酸去掉，是一个值得研究的问题。
