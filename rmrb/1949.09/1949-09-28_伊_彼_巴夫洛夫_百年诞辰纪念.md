　　Among the many brilliant scholars truly admired by Soviet science and progressive schools of thought worldwide, I.P. Pavlov ranks among the foremost.

    Pavlov was a great Russian materialist physiologist. As is well known, physiology is a branch of biological science. It is the foundation of modern medicine, sports, and other disciplines. It is formed by accurate experiments, tests, and objective observations.

    Pavlov was one of the most outstanding scholars and thinkers; not only numerous scientific inventions but an entire era in the development of natural science are associated with his name. His classic works on the study of nervous system activity represent the greatest victory of materialism over idealism.

    On September 26, 1949, the vast Soviet people will commemorate the centenary of this great Soviet scholar, excellent citizen, and sincere patriot.

    I.P. Pavlov was a great innovator and revolutionary in the scientific community. Pavlov is the national glory of our people. In the difficult years, when the hordes of heinous enemies struck the capital of our socialist motherland – Moscow – Comrade Stalin, in the ranks of the greatest sons of the Russian people, called out the name of Pavlov, and his example inspired our soldiers in the battle to defend the motherland.

    I.P. Pavlov was born on September 26 (Old Calendar, the 14th) of 1849 in Ryazan. His ancestors were serfs, and his father was a poor parish priest. From childhood, Pavlov enjoyed physical labor and gymnastics, and he was also passionate about literature. He overcame the drudgery of seminary lessons with great patience, and the great book of nature was his main spiritual inspiration.

    Even as a child, Pavlov stood out from his contemporaries for his great tenacity in achieving his goals, and he maintained a lifelong love of physical labor. Later, he wrote to the miners of Donbass: "... throughout my life, I have liked intellectual and physical labor, especially the latter even more. I am particularly satisfied when I later obtain some good inferences, that is, when I combine my head and hands. You have embarked on this path – I sincerely wish you to advance further along this only path that guarantees human happiness."

    As we now look back in amazement at Pavlov's energy, his elevation of physiology to a new and high stage cannot help but make us feel that the combination of intellectual and physical labor played a proper role in cultivating his qualities.

    The 1860s were characterized by the high tide of the Russian revolutionary movement. Herzen's "The Bell" rang out, calling for resistance against the Tsarist regime. The angry denunciations of Chernyshevsky, Dobrolyubov, and Pisarev shook Russia. In Ryazan, the youth, like wildfire, held "Modern" magazine in their hands, its articles stimulating their thoughts and provoking heated debates and discussions. Under the influence of Pisarev's impassioned articles, the young Pavlov decided to dedicate himself to natural science. He left Ryazan Seminary and entered the University of Saint Petersburg. At this time, he was able to read one of the greatest achievements of human thought – Sechenov's "Reflexes of the Brain." This book left a deep impression on the young Pavlov's mind, and after more than thirty years, he was able to discover the solution to the experimental problem posed by Sechenov.

    At the university, Pavlov created a new method for obtaining a fixed fistula of the gastric gland, and he was awarded a first-class gold medal for his work.

    After graduating from university, Pavlov entered the Academy of Medical Surgery, where the consistency of physiology, theory and practice, and clinical investigation was advocated. After graduating from the academy, he accepted an invitation to serve as the director of the laboratory of Professor Botkin's surgical hospital.

    Creative cooperation with the great Russian surgical scholar benefited Pavlov greatly. At Botkin's surgical hospital, Pavlov completed his thesis on the neural regulation of cardiac activity. Pavlov was the first to discover that nerves change the strength of cardiac contraction, that is, the characteristics of myocardial work, without changing its rhythm. This invention of a new type of neural influence was later developed by Pavlov's students – Academician Orbeli and Speransky – and established the theory that the nervous system plays a nutritional role, that is, regulating cell nutrition. This work is also one of the most successful methods of treatment created – the new Novocain blockade method designed by Professor Vishnevsky.

    Pavlov immediately returned to the study of the laws of digestive organ activity. The renowned surgeon, dedicated and patient experimentalist, Pavlov began to suture fistulas onto the walls of many digestive glands. He paid particular attention to the gastric fistula first discovered by the Moscow surgeon Basov. In order to obtain pure gastric juice, unmixed with different foods, Pavlov designed a surgical procedure to isolate a small stomach. The essence of this procedure was to create, on an animal, a structure resembling a second small stomach from a section of the stomach wall, with its cavity connected to the outside world by a fistula. All glands and nerves were maintained within the small stomach, so its activity became a mirror of the large stomach's work.

    The famous Pavlov's "sham feeding" experiment was decisive for the discovery of the mechanisms of gastric secretion stimulation. As a result of the special surgery, the animal's food did not enter the stomach but leaked out. However, at the same time, a large amount of gastric juice was produced. This experiment indicated that the occurrence of gastric juice was due to the complex action of the nervous system. Cutting the nerves leading to the stomach stopped the sham feeding from stimulating the production of gastric juice.

    Pavlov invented the laws governing the activity of digestive glands with clear and precise experiments. The results of this investigation were published in the famous "Lectures on the Work of the Main Digestive Glands," published in Saint Petersburg in 1897. In terms of the abundance of facts and creativity, no book can compare with it. It has been translated into various languages and has earned the author the glory of a natural science classic.

    Pavlov's work, together with other endeavors, advanced practical medicine by a significant step. All modern research and treatment methods of the gastrointestinal tract are based on the accurate and brilliant physiological materials obtained by Pavlov. This work is now continued by Pavlov's student Razenkov and countless colleagues, as well as the friendly Léopoldski and Strójésko at the Surgical Research Institute.

    After the great success of era-defining surgical methods in experimental science of physiology, Pavlov was already over sixty years old; one would think that he could retire with honor. But Pavlov did not consider "retiring after success" at all. New, great plans occupied the great natural scientist. Pavlov began to study higher nervous activity, which was his main contribution to materialist science.

    Pavlov's past work propelled physiological science forward to such an extent that it discovered the possibility of experimentally studying the problem posed by Sechenov: that the brain is the material basis of psychological life, and what are the reflexes of the brain?

    This transformation was not accidental for Pavlov; it was derived from all his previous research activities. While studying the secretion of gastric juice, Pavlov discovered that the animal's psychology, its "strong appetite," was one of the powerful factors in secretion. Psychological aspects of eating were so intertwined with physiological aspects that it was impossible to separate them from each other. Here, Pavlov was an objective and unbiased experimentalist.

    Pavlov pointed out that "in studying the activity of the higher parts of the central nervous system in physiology, we must use the same true methods as those used in studying the lower parts, that is, to accurately compare the changes in the external world with the corresponding changes in the animal's organism, and to establish the laws of these relationships."

    Regardless of what idealistic psychologists thought and studied at the time, Pavlov asserted that all activities of animals, including psychological activities, proceed according to lawful principles; if an animal, to use a biological term, does not accurately adapt to the external world, if it cannot highly adapt to its surrounding environment, then sooner or later it will cease to exist. If an animal does not move towards food and away from it, does not avoid fire and throw itself into the fire, etc., then it will soon die. It should react to the external world in such a way as to secure its own survival. This activity of the animal is mainly manifested in muscle movements, in behavior. However, active reactions are not very convenient for physiological research. It is too complex, containing many mutually influencing muscle movements, and it is difficult to calculate and record. At this time, accurate measurement of animal reactions must become the basis of new methods. It is necessary to find simple reactions that can be accurately calculated and measured.

    Pavlov engaged in the study of salivary gland work, which is obtained from the so-called "door" of the digestive tract. Previously, physiologists studied the separation of saliva only during direct eating, accurately considering it as a reflex. Pavlov proved with precise experiments that saliva not only begins to flow when feeding animals but also when they see food, smell food, hear the footsteps of the person feeding the dog, etc. Unlike the innate reflex that causes saliva when eating, distant stimuli (seeing food, smelling food, the sound of footsteps) only begin to cause saliva to flow after they are slightly combined with the process of eating. This reflex is not innate but is acquired during the course of life.

    Pavlov therefore discovered the basic law of the activity of the higher parts of the central nervous system – closure or temporal connection is the basis of brain reflexes. If the same early external stimuli are combined with stimuli that regularly cause certain instinctive reflex reactions, then, as Pavlov pointed out, a new neural pathway closure occurs in the cerebral cortex to consolidate training. At this time, the same early external stimuli cause the same reaction in the animal, which is the reaction caused by the previously unconditional stimuli. Therefore, any previously undifferentiated change in the external world, in Pavlov's terminology, "conditioned stimulus," becomes a signal for the next occurrence of an unconditional stimulus and causes a corresponding reaction in the animal. Pavlov called this phenomenon a conditioned reflex.

    The discovery of the "precious rule" of conditioned reflex formation handed over the vast field of psychological phenomena to materialist experimentalists. He can form new conditioned reflexes and study their occurrence. He can mix various different stimuli to study the interaction of conditioned reflexes.

    Pavlov pointed out that the complex process of higher nervous activity can be reduced to the movement of the stimulation and inhibition processes of the cerebral cortex. He pointed out that "all higher nervous activity, as it is expressed in conditioned reflexes, is composed of constant alternation, or better, is the balancing of three basic processes – stimulation, inhibition, and dispersion." Pavlov began to calculate several inhibitory processes, and further, he came to the conclusion that they represent the same process. Later, he recognized that stimulation and inhibition are two aspects of one nerve process. "Inhibition often follows stimulation. ... It is the inside of stimulation in some species." This illustrates the depth of Pavlov's thought, his ability to achieve dialectical generalization and understanding of the unity of these opposing processes of higher nervous activity. He discovered the path from one process to another and established the general law of cerebral cortical activity.

    Modern research techniques can record the electrical processes of the cerebral cortex that accompany neural activity. The research first created by Livánov made it possible to explore the stimulation and inhibition movement processes of the cerebral cortex. Thus, Pavlov's vision of studying the material spatial processes directly in the cerebral cortex was realized.

    We have been able to prove that the formation of conditioned reflexes can also be used on fish. Furthermore, it has been proven that they exist in other animals. The general biological significance of the principle of temporal connection, which Pavlov discovered in all animal kingdom, mainly vertebrates, is thereby consolidated. The sum total of conditioned reflexes acquired by animals in the course of life forms their life experience. The type of animal, the nature of its behavior, is accumulated from the innate characteristics and the characteristics acquired as a result of the influence of the outside environment. However, Pavlov placed the influence of the outside environment in the first place. This is how Sechenov understood this problem. "It can be said," Pavlov pointed out, "that certain conditioned reflexes, newly formed reflexes, later become hereditary and unconditional reflexes." It is worth noting that Pavlov reached this conclusion as early as 1913, which is in harmony with the latest achievements of Michurin biology regarding the material that characteristics acquired in the individual life of an organism can be inherited. Pavlov also pointed out the path through which higher animals can produce such changes.

    The similarity between Pavlov's remarks and the conclusions of the great natural transformer Michurin is not accidental. He repeatedly emphasized the great advanced and progressive role played by our natural science. In solving the most urgent problems of contemporary biology, Soviet science strives to transform the plant and animal kingdom on a new, rational basis.

    As a representative of advanced science, Pavlov could not and never did stay within the narrow confines of his own theories, although these theories were new, original, and bold. What always interested him most was their practical value, that is, the concrete things they could benefit mankind. Man, his health, his happiness, his labor, was the ultimate goal that this great researcher sought. He concluded his famous "Lectures on the Work of the Cerebral Hemispheres" with a special lecture on "Applying Experimental Materials Obtained from Animals to Humans." In Koltushi near Leningrad, he established the Institute for Evolutionary Comparative Research of Higher Nervous Activity of Animals, including apes, which are closer to humans. This work is now led by Academician Orbeli, Pavlov's closest student.

    Pavlov was interested not only in physiology but also in the pathology of nervous activity. In addition to laboratory work, he also led the work of the Neuro-Psychological Surgical Hospital, where his student Ivanov-Smolensky worked. As a result of this labor, the key to understanding the occurrence process of human neuropathy was discovered, and methods for neurological treatment and restoration of damaged equilibrium were studied and obtained. Pavlov pointed out that in the failure of the central nervous system and experimental neuropathy, the inhibitory process begins to significantly dominate, and the animal falls into a state of prolonged sleep, maintaining the tranquility of the cells. Sleep prevents further fatigue of the central nervous system. Pavlov concluded that: if you want to free the animal from the neuropathic state, then you must artificially strengthen the inhibitory process and maintain long-term sleep. This experiment was brilliantly successful and has been applied in human clinics. Long-term sleep has proven to be the best means of restoring nerve processes damaged during wartime trauma. The theory created by Pavlov has brought rich fruits to clinical practice. This work is now continued by Aslanyan, one of Pavlov's students.

    The theory of the connection between the cerebral cortex and the visceral organs is of no small significance for solving urgent practical problems. In the past, this was the most difficult part of physiology. Now, Pavlov's student, Academician Bykov, and his colleagues, following the path indicated by Pavlov, have obtained a large amount of interesting material based on the method of conditioned reflexes he studied, which has created a new, Soviet foundation for physiology.

    The fact that the activity of the visceral organs changes under the influence of cerebral cortex stimulation has been confirmed by experiments of hypnotic state and suggestion. For example, if a person in a hypnotic state lifts something heavy and is suggested that it is light, and for another person lifting something light, it is suggested that it is heavy, then the second person feels fatigue much faster than the first person, regardless of how little work he has done. This is not just a subjective feeling of fatigue. It is also possible to objectively record the arrival of the signs of fatigue in the second person. This experiment was done by Krestovnikov, a student of Pavlov.

    As everyone knows, there are more amazing facts; if the test subject is suggested that a red-hot coin is placed on his skin, but in reality, an ordinary cold coin is placed, then he not only feels pain as if it were a real burn, but the people around him see within a few minutes that the test subject's skin has prominent characteristic fire burn blisters and swelling. Conversely, if a hot coin is placed and it is suggested that it is cold, then the test subject does not feel pain at all, and the local reaction is much smaller than usual. The methods of performing surgical operations and painless childbirth under hypnosis are based on this.

    These facts are of great significance for the correct solution of nutritional problems, for the organization of labor and living conditions, and for all our lives. As a higher biological being, man is not only a biological but primarily a social being, and the social environment and social activities are the decisive factors in life. The great Pavlov's theory and the succession of Soviet scholars to his labor help to understand how moral factors can be innovated in the material life of the organism.

    It is hard to believe that a person can study so many problems in his life. Although Pavlov was a genius, if he were a solitary scholar, then he would not have been able to master such a large scope of problems. But Pavlov was first of all a leader of a large and creative group. Attracted by the torch of Pavlov's genius, and inspired by the desire to develop the science of the motherland, young scholars from all over our vast motherland poured into Pavlov's laboratory. Pavlov was the soul of this large group. He was good at organizing work so perfectly that each colleague could purposefully and correctly complete the general task.

    Pavlov is the father of Soviet physiology, its "first marshal." Only because of the Soviet socialist system could Pavlov's theory produce such rich fruits. In 1921, in the difficult days after the end of the civil war, when every gram of bread, every piece of metal, and fuel had to be accounted for, Lenin issued a special directive of the Soviet People's Committee to help the work of Pavlov's laboratory in every possible way. It is well known how much Comrade Stalin himself showed great concern and attention to the development of the science of the motherland. For example, before the revolution, a laboratory was built only with funds from private donations, but under the Soviet regime, a complete scientific city was built near Leningrad in Koltushi (now Pavlov Town) – "the capital of conditioned reflexes" – which was equipped with the latest science and technology. Pavlov said to the people who attended the Fifteenth International Congress of Physiology: "Science is generous in our country. The leaders of our scientific institutions feel anxious and uneasy about whether we can be worthy of all the funds given to us by the government."

    Due to the work of Pavlov and his students, the physiology of our motherland has left foreign science far behind. At the Fifteenth International Physiological Congress held in Leningrad in 1935, Pavlov was unanimously recognized as the "old veteran of world physiology." Today, some "scholars" in capitalist countries are attempting to reduce the role of the great Pavlov and his theory, and slander him, which is very despicable. This attempt has recently been particularly strengthened in the American cultural circle, where a slander campaign is underway to "reverse black and white" and prove that the great theory of conditioned reflexes was not created by Russian science, not by Pavlov, but by them, the Americans. Fulton, Liddell, and others are doing these dirty tricks. The attempt to harm the prestige of our science on this important issue has aroused our justified anger.

    There are a group of bourgeois "critics" who verbally acknowledge Pavlov's authority and attempt to castrate the essence of his theory, insisting that this theory cannot enable us to understand psychological activities, as if psychological things are generally unknowable. This rebuttal is not new. Pavlov's theory, in the process of its own development, has always opened up its own path by fighting ruthlessly with idealism. The spirit of Pavlov's theory itself is profoundly revolutionary, and it destroys all the main foundations of idealism.

    Therefore, all kinds of reactionaries and idealists are frantically attacking Pavlov. In contemporary society, science has party spirit. Those who oppose Pavlov's theory, attempt to reduce it, slander and defame it, and vulgarize it are precisely the representatives of reactionary imperialist "science." However, regardless of these attempts, the truth of the great Pavlov's theory is victoriously crossing all borders and advancing, finding countless supporters in countries around the world.

    Reactionaries also hate Pavlov because he was a great Russian patriot. He sincerely loved the great Russian people and served her with all his strength and all his thoughts. In the difficult days of our motherland, American capitalists gave him various benefits and invited him to go abroad, but he angrily rejected this proposal.

    In 1935, Pavlov wrote: "Whatever I do, I always think about serving my motherland with all my strength." "Huge social reforms are now underway in my motherland. The barbaric gap between the rich and the poor has been eliminated. I want to live to see the final result of this social reform."

    Pavlov faithfully supported the heroic labor of the people of the motherland in building a new society until the last day of his life. In his opening speech at the Fifteenth International Physiological Congress, Pavlov angrily exposed the fascist aggressors who were preparing for a new war. He said: "I am very gratified that the government of my powerful motherland, fighting for peace, has historically declared for the first time: 'Do not want an inch of anyone else's land'."

    Pavlov's relationship with Soviet science is noteworthy. Pavlov said at a reception in his hometown of Ryazan in August 1935: "In the past, science was detached from life and detached from the people, but today I see another situation: the whole people respects and values science - this is the merit of the government that leads our motherland."

    The greatest scholar, Pavlov, who defined an era in the scientific community, was still formulating new and huge work plans on the last day of his life. Everything seemed too little to him.

    "Remember," he said in his letter to the Soviet youth, "science demands the entire life of a person. Science demands a person to have the highest enthusiasm and the greatest effort. If you have twice the life, it is still not enough. ... Recognize the great expectations and hopes of the Soviet motherland for science ...."

    These sincere words to the youth are the legacy of this great scholar.

    Pavlov passed away on February 27, 1936, but his scientific ideas that inspire our scholars are immortal. The cause he created is developing and strengthening. Soviet physiology is tirelessly moving forward and has become the truly advanced and leading science in the world. The name of Pavlov is intimate and respected by every citizen of the Soviet Union. The great and rich scientific thought movement caused by Pavlov and the torrent of ideas he produced cannot be stopped. Pavlov's clear and great materialist explanation of the laws of brain activity has and will have a huge significance for the formation of the world view of the present and future generations of people.

    在苏维埃科学和全世界进步学说真正引以为荣的许多天才的学者当中，伊·彼·巴夫洛夫要算是占首位的一个了。
    巴夫洛夫是伟大的俄罗斯的唯物论生理学家。如所周知，生理学是生物科学中的一门。它是现代医药、体育及其他学科的基础。它是由准确的试验、实验与客观的观察等方法形成的。
    巴夫洛夫是卓越的学者和思想家之一，不仅众多的科学发明，而且自然科学发展的整个时代，都是同他的名字联系着的。他在研究神经系统活动方面的经典著作是唯物论战败唯心论的最伟大的胜利。
    一九四九年九月二十六日广大的苏维埃人民将纪念这位伟大的苏维埃学者、优秀的公民和诚挚的爱国者的百年诞辰。
    伊·彼·巴夫洛夫是科学界伟大的革新者与革命家。巴夫洛夫是我们人民的民族的光荣。在艰苦的年代，当万恶的敌人的兽群打到我们社会主义祖国的首都——莫斯科的时候，斯大林同志曾在最伟大的俄罗斯人民的儿女们行列中呼着巴夫洛夫的名字，在保卫祖国战斗中他的榜样鼓舞了我们的战士们。
    伊·彼·巴夫洛夫在一八四九年九月二十六日（旧历十四日）生于里亚赞。他的先辈是农奴，而父亲是穷苦的城教区的神父。从小时候巴夫洛夫就喜好体力劳动和体操，同时酷爱文学。他以极大的耐心克服了神学校的功课，而伟大的自然的书籍是他的主要的精神鼓舞者。
    还在小的时候，巴夫洛夫以来达到目的的巨大的顽强性，就有异于同时代的人，而一生爱好体力劳动。后来他曾经写信给顿巴斯的矿工们说：“……一生中我过去和现在都喜欢智力劳动与体力劳动，尤其是对于后者更甚些。当以后获得某些好的推论时，即把头与手结合起来的时候，特别使我感到满意。你们走上了这条道路——我衷心地愿意你们沿着这唯一保证人类幸福的道路更向前进。”
    当现在我们惊奇地回顾巴夫洛夫的精力的时候，他把生理学提高到新的和高度的阶段不禁感到智力劳动与体力劳动的结合在培养他的品质中表现了应有的作用。
    上个世纪的六十年代的特点是俄国革命运动的高涨。赫尔岑的“钟声”敲响了，号召起来反抗沙皇制度。车尔尼舍夫斯基、杜布洛柳波夫、毕萨列夫的愤怒的揭发的吼声轰动了俄国。在里亚赞，青年们象野火一样地手里拿着“现代”杂志，它的论文鼓动了青年们的思想，引起了热烈的争辩讨论。在毕萨列夫激昂的文章影响之下，青年的巴夫洛夫决定献身自己于自然科学。他离开里亚赞神学校进了彼得堡大学。这个时候他得以读到人类思想巨大成就之一—谢巧诺夫的“脑髓反射”一书。这书在青年的巴夫洛夫的思想中留下了深刻的印象，他经过了三十多年，能够发现了谢巧诺夫所提出的实验问题的解决。
    在大学中巴夫洛夫创造了获得胃腺固定漏管的新方法，为了他的工作被授以一等金质奖章。
    巴夫洛夫在大学毕业后，进外科医学研究院学习，那里是主张生理学、理论与实际及临床调查相一致的。研究院毕业后，他接受邀请充当外科教授波特金外科医院实验室的主任。
    同伟大的俄国外科学者之创造性的合作，使巴夫洛夫获益良多。在波特金的外科医院中巴夫洛夫完成了自己关于神经调节心脏活动的论文。巴夫洛夫第一个发现了神经是变换心脏收缩的力量，即心肌工作的特点，它的韵律没有变化。这个新型神经影响的发明以后为巴夫洛夫的学生——奥尔伯利和斯伯兰斯基院士所发展，并建立了关于神经系统起营养作用的学说，即调节细胞的营养。这个工作同样是最成功的治疗方法创造之一——维士涅夫斯基教授所设计的新＠卡因闭锁法。
    巴夫洛夫又立刻回到消化器官活动规律的研究。声名昭著的外科医生、专心耐心的实验家、巴夫洛夫开始缝合漏管于许多消化腺的管壁上。他尤其注意首先由莫斯科外科医生巴索夫所发现的胃漏管。为了获得纯的、不同食物混合的胃液，巴夫洛夫设计了隔离小胃的手术。它的实质就是在动物身上，从胃壁的一部分做成象第二个小胃一样，它的腔用漏管同外界相通。在小胃内保持有一切腺体同神经，因此它的活动成为大胃工作的镜子一样。
    有名的巴夫洛夫的假食的实验，对胃分泌刺激的机构的发现有决定的意义。特殊的手术的结果，动物的食物没有进到胃里，而漏到外面去了。然而同时一样发生大量的胃液。这个实验指出了胃液的发生是由于神经系统复杂的作用。切断通到胃里的神经，假食即不刺激胃液的发生了。
    巴夫洛夫以清晰而准确的实验发明了消化腺活动的规律。这个调查研究的结果发表在有名的“主要消化腺工作讲义”中，一八九七年在彼得堡出版。论到事实和创造的新颖丰富，没有书能与它相比的。它被译成各国的语言，并给作者获得自然科学经典的光荣。
    巴夫洛夫这个与其他的劳作，使实用医药学前进了一大步。当代的一切肠胃管道的研究与治疗方法，都是根据巴夫洛夫所获得的正确辉煌的生理学材料。这个工作现由巴夫洛夫的学生拉赞柯夫及无数的同道者继续着，还有在外科研究院的友好列波尔斯基与斯特娄耶斯柯。
    在生理学上实验科学中划时代的外科方法的巨大成功之后，巴夫洛夫已年过六十，人会想他完全可以光荣地休息了吧。但是巴夫洛夫毫不考虑“功成身退”。新的、巨大的计划占据了伟大的自然科学家。巴夫洛夫开始研究高级神经活动，这是他在科学的唯物论中的主要贡献。
    巴夫洛夫过去的工作是这样地推动了生理科学向前，以致发现了实验的研究谢巧诺夫所提出的问题的可能：头脑是心理生活的物质基础，而什么是头脑的反射呢？
    这个转变对巴夫洛夫不是偶然的，他是从他以前的一切研究活动中得出的。在研究胃液的分泌时，巴夫洛夫就发现，动物的心理，它的“强烈的食欲”，是分泌的有力因素之一。饮食上的心理东西是如此同生理东西错综在一起的，所以要把它们彼此分开是不可能的。在这里巴夫洛夫是客观的、不偏的实验家。
    巴夫洛夫指出说：“在生理学研究中枢神经系高级部分的活动时，必须用同样真实的方法，象研究低级部分时所用的一样，即准确地把外界的变化与动物有机体内相适应的变化加以比较，并确立这些关系的规律”。
    不管当时的唯心论心理学者是如何想的及研究了什么，巴夫洛夫断言，动物的一切活动，包括心理的活动在内，是合法则地进行着的；假如动物，用生物学的名词来说，不是准确地适应外界，假如它不能高度地适应自己周围的环境，那它迟早要停止生存的。假如动物不是趋向食物而离开它，不是躲避火而自己投到火中等等，那么它很快就要死亡的。它应当那样地反应于外界，以获得自己的生存。动物的这种活动，主要地表现在肌肉的运动中，在行为之中。然而能动的反应对于生理学的研究不是十分方便的。它太复杂了，自己含有许多互相影响的肌肉的动作，它很难以计算和记录，这时候动物反应之准确测量就必须成为新方法的基础了。必须找出简单的可以精确地计算与测定的反应。
    巴夫洛夫从事唾腺工作的研究，这唾腺是得自所谓消化管的“门”的。以前生理学者们研究了唾液之分离，仅是在直接吃东西的时候，正确地把它所作为反射。巴夫洛夫以精确的试验证明，唾液不仅在喂动物的时候开始流出，而且在看见食物，嗅到食物，听到喂狗的人的脚步声等的时候，就流出来。与天赋的、在食时引起唾液的反射相不同，远隔的刺激物（看到食物，嗅到食物，脚步声音），仅是在它们与食的过程稍微结合之后才开始使唾液流出。这种反射不是天赋的，而是在生活过程中得来的。
    巴夫洛夫因此发现了中枢神经系高级部分活动的基本规律—闭锁或时间联系乃是头脑反射之基础。假如相同的早期的外部刺激物，同经常引起一定的本能的反射反应的刺激物相结合，那末，如巴夫洛夫所指出的，在大脑半球皮质中发生新的神经通路的闭锁，用以巩固训练。这时早期的相同的外部刺激物就引起了动物的相同的反应，这种反应是以前无条件的刺激物所引起的。因此，外界的任何从前没有差别的任何变化，按照巴夫洛夫的术语“条件刺激物”，成为下次发生无条件刺激物之信号，而引起动物的相适应的反应。巴夫洛夫把这种现象称之为条件反射。
    条件反射形成的“宝贵规则”的发现，把心理现象之巨大领域交给唯物论实验家手中了。他可以组成新的条件反射，并研究其发生。他可以把各种不同的刺激物混合起来，去研究条件反射的相互作用。
    巴夫洛夫指出了，高级神经活动的复杂过程，可归结为头脑皮质刺激与抑制过程的运动，他指出说：“一切高级神经活动，如它在条件反射中表现的，是由经常的交替组成的，或者说的好一些，是三个基本过程——刺激、抑制与离散的平衡化”。巴夫洛夫开始计算了几种抑制过程，进一步他得到了结论说，它们表现着同样的过程。以后他认定，刺激与抑制是一个神经过程的两方面。“抑制经常随在刺激的后面。……它在某些种类中是刺激之里面”。这里说明了巴夫洛夫思想的深刻，善于对高级神经活动的这些对立过程的统一达到辩证法的概括和理解。他发现了从一个过程进到另一个过程的道路，并确立了大脑半球皮质活动的一般规律。
    现代的研究技术能够把伴随神经活动的大脑半球皮质的电流过程记录下来。李瓦诺夫初次所创造的研究，使得以探索脑髓皮质的刺激与抑制运动过程。因此，巴夫洛夫关于研究直接在脑髓皮质的物质空间过程的幻想，就实现了。
    我们已经做到可以证明，条件反射的组成，也可以用在鱼类身上。更进一步证明了它们存在于其他的动物身上。巴夫洛夫所发现的一切动物界主要是脊椎动物中时间联系原则一般生物学的意义，由此巩固了。动物在生活过程中获得的条件反射的总合，形成了它的生活经验。动物的类型，它的行为的性质，是由天赋的与在外面环境影响的结果所获得的特点积累起来的。然而巴夫洛夫把外面环境的影响放在第一位。谢巧诺夫就是这样理解这个问题的。“可以说——巴夫洛夫指出——某些条件反射，重新形成的反射——后来由遗传性变成无条件的反射。”值得注意的，这个结论，巴夫洛夫还在一九一三年就达到了，这是与米邱林生物学关于有机体个体生活中所获得的特征能够遗传的最新成就之材料，异曲同工的。巴夫洛夫并且指出了高等动物能够产生此种变化的道路。
    巴夫洛夫言论与伟大的自然改造者米邱林结论之相近，不是偶然的。他再三强调了我们自然科学所表现的巨大的先进的和进步的作用。在解决当代生物学的最紧迫的问题中，苏维埃科学力谋以新的、合理的基础来改造植物和动物界。
    作为先进科学的代表者，巴夫洛夫不能也从来没有停留在自己理论的狭小圈子里，虽然这些理论是新的、独创的与大胆的。使他永远最感兴趣的是它们的实际的价值，也就是它们所能造福人类的具体东西。人，他的健康，他的幸福，他的劳动，是这位伟大的研究者寻找的最终目的。他以特别的讲义“论从动物所得的实验材料应用于人类”，结束了他的有名的“大脑半球工作讲义”。在列宁格勒附近的柯尔杜什他举办了动物高级神经活动进化比较研究所，包括更接近人类的——猿猴在内。这个工作，现在由巴夫洛夫最亲近的学生研究院院士奥尔伯利领导。
    巴夫洛夫感兴趣的不仅有生理学，而且有神经活动的病理学。除了实验室的工作以外，他还领导了神经与心理外科医院的工作，他的学生伊凡诺夫—斯模棱斯基就在这里工作的。由于这个劳作，发现了理解人的神经病发生过程的关健，研究了并获得了神经治疗与恢复被破坏了的平衡的方法。巴夫洛夫指出了，在中枢神经系统失效与实验神经病时，抑制过程开始显著占优势，动物陷于长期睡眠状态，保持细胞的平静。睡眠阻碍了中枢神经系之进一步疲劳。巴夫洛夫得到结论说：假如使动物脱离神经病状态，那你就要人工地加强抑制过程并保持长期的睡眠。这个经验辉煌地成功了，并应用于人类临床学中。长期睡眠证明了是恢复在战时创伤中被破坏了的神经过程之最好手段。巴夫洛夫所创造的学说，给临床实践带来了丰富的果实。这个工作现在由巴夫洛夫的学生之一阿斯拉江继续着。
    脑髓皮质与内脏器官联系的学说，对紧迫的实践问题之解决有不小的意义。在从前的时候，这是生理学最困难的部分。现在，巴夫洛夫的学生、研究院院士贝柯夫及其同事者，按照巴夫洛夫指示的道路，根据他所研究的条件反射的方法，获得了大量的有趣的材料，这些材料创造了生理学的新的、苏维埃的基础。
    在脑髓皮质刺激影响下，内脏器官活动变化的事实，由催眠状态的实验与暗示证实了。例如，假使催眠状态下的人举起重的东西，而暗示他东西是轻的，对另外一个举轻东西的人，暗示东西是重的，那末第二个人比第一个人感觉疲劳要快的多，不管他做了很少的工作。这不仅是主观的疲劳感觉。并且可以记录下第二个人疲劳征兆的客观地来到。这个试验，是由巴夫洛夫的学生克列斯托夫尼可夫所做的。
    众所周知，还有更令人惊奇的事实，假如暗示被试验的人，说给他的皮肤放上烧红的钱，而实际上是放上普通的冷钱，那么他不仅感觉到痛，好象真正的烧一样，而且周围的人在几分钟内看到，被试验的人的皮肤上突起了特异的火烧的水泡与红肿。反之，假如放上热的钱，而暗示是冷的，那末被试验的人完全不感觉痛疼，而局部的反应比平常小的多。在催眠状态下施行外科手术的方法、无痛分娩，即以此为根据的。
    这些事实对于营养问题的正确解决，对于劳动与生活状况的组织，对于我们一切生活，有巨大的意义。作为高级生物的人，不仅是生物的，而首先是社会的存在物，社会的环境，社会的活动是生活中的决定因素。伟大的巴夫洛夫的学说与苏维埃学者对他的劳作之继承，帮助理解，在有机体的物质生活中，道德的因素可用什么方法革新。
    一个人在其生活过程中。研究了这么多的问题，可以说是难以置信的。巴夫洛夫虽有天才，但是他如果是个孤独的学者，那末他就不能精通这么大范围的问题。而巴夫洛夫首先就是大的有创造性的集团之一个领导者。为巴夫洛夫的天才的火炬所吸引，为发展祖国科学的热望所鼓舞，青年学者们从我们广大祖国的各地涌入巴夫洛夫的实验室。巴夫洛夫是这个大集团的灵魂。他善于把工作组织得如此完善，以致每个同事者可以有目的地正确地完成总的任务。
    巴夫洛夫是苏维埃生理学之父，它的“第一个元帅”。只有由于苏维埃社会主义的制度，巴夫洛夫的学说才能产生这样丰富的果实。在一九二一年，内战结束以后的艰苦日子，那时每一克面包，每一块金属，燃料，都要计较，列宁签发了苏维埃人民委员会的特别指令，要用一切方法帮助巴夫洛夫实验室的工作。斯大林本人对于祖国科学的发展曾有如何巨大的关心和注意，这是众所周知的。例如，在革命以前，仅赖私人捐助的款项，建筑了一所实验室，但是在苏维埃政权之下，在列宁格勒附近的柯尔杜什（现在的巴夫洛夫镇）建设了一所完整的科学的城市——“条件反射的首都”——，它是按照最新的科学与技术装备的。巴夫洛夫对参加第十五届国际生理学大会的人们说过：“在我们国家内对科学是宽宏的。我们科学机关的领导者，感觉惶恐与不安的是：我们能否对得起政府给予我们的一切款项”。
    由于巴夫洛夫与他的学生的工作，我们祖国的生理学把外国的科学远远地丢在后面。在一九三五年在列宁格勒所举行的第十五届国际生理学大学上，巴夫洛夫被一致地承认为“世界生理学的老前辈”。今天资本主义国家的某些“学者”企图降低伟大的巴夫洛夫和他的学说的作用，并且中伤他，那是很可鄙的。这种企图，近来在美国文化界中特别加强了，那里正在进行的诽谤运动，目的是在“颠倒黑白”，并且证明，关于条件反射的伟大学说，好象不是俄国的科学，不是巴夫洛夫创造的，而是他们，美国人创造的。富尔通·列什里及其他等人就是干这些勾当的。想在这个重大问题上，损害我们科学威信的企图，引起了我们的正当的愤怒。
    有那么一批资产阶级的“批评家”，他们在口头上承认巴夫洛夫的权威，企图阉割他的学说的实质，硬说这个学说不能使我们理解心理的活动，好象心理东西一般地是不可知的。这种反驳不是新的。巴夫洛夫的学说在自己发展的过程中，经常地是在同唯心论的无情斗争为自己打开道路的。巴夫洛夫学说的精神本身是深刻地革命的，它摧毁了一切唯心论的主要根基。
    因此，各色各样的反动派与唯心论者，都是疯狂地攻击巴夫洛夫的。在当代的社会里，科学是有党性的。反对巴夫洛夫学说，企图降低它，中伤诽谤，使它庸俗化的正是反动的帝国主义“科学”的代表们。然而，不管这些企图，伟大的巴夫洛夫学说之真理，胜利地越过一切国界在前进着，在世界各国找到了无数的拥护者。
    反动派还憎恨巴夫洛夫，因为他是伟大的俄国的爱国主义者。他诚挚地热爱伟大的俄国人民，并以自己的一切力量，一切思想为她服务。在我们祖国艰苦的日子，美国资本家给他各种好处邀请他到外国去，他愤怒地拒绝了这个提议。
    在一九三五年巴夫洛夫写道：“不论我做什么，我总是想着，尽我的一切力量为我的祖国服务”。“在我的祖国，现在正进行着巨大的社会改革。富人与穷人之间的野蛮的鸿沟消灭了。我愿意活下去，直到看见这种社会改革的最后结果为止。”
    巴夫洛夫忠实地并且直到自己活的最后一天，都拥护祖国人民的建设新社会的英雄的劳动。在第十五届国际生理学大会开幕的演说辞中，巴夫洛夫愤怒地揭发了准备新战争的法西斯侵略者。他说：“我很欣慰的，是我的强大祖国之政府，为和平而奋斗，在历史上第一次宣布了：‘不要别人的一寸地’。”
    巴夫洛夫对苏维埃科学的关系是值得注意的。巴夫洛夫在一九三五年八月间答复访问自己故乡里亚赞的欢迎会上说：“从前的科学是脱离生活的，脱离人民的，而今天我看到另一种情况：全体人民尊敬与重视科学——这是领导我们祖国的政府的功绩”。
    最伟大的学者，在科学界中划时代的巴夫洛夫，在自己活的最后一天，还拟定了新的、巨大的工作计划。一切对他来说，似乎做的太少了。
    “记着，——他给苏维埃青年们的信中说——科学要求人的全部生命。科学要求人要有极高的热情和最大的努力。假若你有两倍的生命，仍旧是不够用的。……认清楚苏维埃祖国对于科学的伟大的期待和希望吧………”。
    向青年们说的这些热诚的字句，是这位伟大的学者的遗产。
    一九三六年二月二十七日巴夫洛夫逝世了，而他的鼓舞我们学者的科学思想是永存的。他所创造的事业发展着加强着。苏维埃生理学，不倦地向前进，成了世界上真正先进的和领导的科学。巴夫洛夫的名字是为苏联每个公民所亲密的和敬重的。巴夫洛夫所引起的伟大而丰富的科学思想运动，他所产生的思想之洪流是不能停止的。巴夫洛夫关于脑髓活动规律的明确而伟大的用唯物论说明的学说，对于现在和将来一代的人们的世界观之形成，在现在和将来将都有巨大的意义。
