We will continue to work together with you and progressive people around the world until freedom is achieved everywhere, education and culture attain their due status, every thatched cottage is transformed into a comfortable dwelling, the products of the earth are easily accessible, the harvests of factories are commensurate with the labor expended, every family receives free medical care from birth to death, and everyone, regardless of race, color, creed, or place of residence, equally obtains their necessities. Our joint efforts will not cease until the above goals are achieved.

    向你为和平与国际合作的光辉领导致最诚挚的祝贺。中国的教训证明你伟大的预见。中国人民必须响应孙中山的号召，争取完全的独立，铲除殖民地制度，埋葬封建主义。我们将和你及世界进步人士继续共同努力，直到世界各处都获得自由，教育和文化取得他应有的地位，每一间茅舍都改建成舒适的住屋，大地的产品很容易可以买到，工厂的收获相当于所付出的劳动。每个家庭由生到死都能得到免费的医药，每个人不问种族、肤色、信仰和居住地域，都能平等地获得他的必需品。在上述目标尚未实现之前，我们的共同努力决不停止。
