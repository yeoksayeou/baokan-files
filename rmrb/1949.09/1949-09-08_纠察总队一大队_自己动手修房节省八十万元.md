(From this City) The residence of the First Battalion of the Military Police Corps was severely damaged due to years of disrepair and destruction by the Chiang bandits. Over one hundred and four rooms were leaking, and more than ten sections of walls had collapsed. It was estimated that the repair materials and labor would cost 13,023 jin of millet. In order to reduce the government's financial burden, the Communist Party Committee of the battalion decided to repair the houses themselves. All the members deeply understood this decision and collected a large amount of old materials to replace wood and bricks. After more than ten days of hard work, most of the repairs have been completed. Preliminary statistics show that a total of 816,760 yuan has been saved.
