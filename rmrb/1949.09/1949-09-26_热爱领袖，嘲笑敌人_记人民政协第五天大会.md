　　Loving the Leader, Mocking the Enemy
    ——A Record of the Fifth Day of the CPPCC Conference
    At the fifth day of the CPPCC conference, many representatives relentlessly mocked the reactionary factions, both domestic and foreign. When Guo Moruo spoke, he used deeply poetic sentences, saying: We "harbor neither the slightest illusion nor the slightest fear towards American imperialism. This paper tiger of American imperialism has already been pierced. We must continue to work hard to pierce it, piercing it until it is covered in wounds and unrecognizable." Among the twenty representatives who spoke yesterday, four or five were generals who had revolted and joined our side. They also unanimously mocked the Kuomintang reactionaries and their leader, Chiang Kai-shek. Chen Mingren said, "Chiang Kai-shek is not only not revolutionary" but also "an enemy of the people," and he said, "Of course I want to overthrow him."
    Our soldiers are the best at mocking the enemy, saying that Chiang Kai-shek, this "transportation captain," has almost completed his transportation task. He has already found many houses abroad and wants to become a "White Chinese."
    Having defeated the enemy, the remaining task is construction. Zhu Xuefan spoke, guaranteeing to "strive for the complete realization of the entire Common Program, especially all the economic policies in the program." Bo Yibo, representing the 67 million people of North China, wholeheartedly supported the Common Program of the CPPCC. He assured the conference that "agricultural production will be fully restored to pre-war levels within two years" and to "strive to restore and reorganize industrial production in North China in a planned and step-by-step manner within five to ten years." The Sixth Group of the CPPCC Preparatory Committee suggested to the conference that Beijing be designated as the capital, listing "Beijing is located in the old liberated areas of North China, and the people's strength is strong" as one of the important reasons. The old liberated areas are willing to contribute more to the construction of the new China, and the new liberated areas are willing to learn from the old liberated areas. Soon all of China will be liberated, and large-scale construction can proceed steadily.
    Many representatives have expressed their willingness to work hard in different positions for the realization of the common goal. Everyone does their best to do their part well, which is the best cooperation. Ma Xulun, the chief representative of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, said: "The interests of our national capitalists are inseparable from the interests of the country and the nation, so they will certainly be able to build an industrialized new China together in accordance with the economic policies of the Common Program." Two representatives of people's organizations in Shanghai unanimously mocked the enemy's blockade. When the enemy was still in power, we fought them, "one person fell, and thousands of people stood up," and eventually overthrew them. Now, the enemy clowns are jumping around, having a brief resurgence, "what are we still afraid of?"
    At yesterday's meeting, people saw two distinct contrasting emotions: endless ridicule and hatred for the enemy, and endless love and concern for the people's leaders. Representatives of the Inner Mongolia people and two Mongolian girls in colorful Mongolian costumes presented flowers to the CPPCC, Chairman Mao, and Commander-in-Chief Zhu. The representative also gave a congratulatory speech, saying to Chairman Mao: "We love you like we love the winter sun." The Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Democratic Women's Federation also presented flowers to Chairman Mao. Six children from the Beihai Nursery innocently and naively walked to the rostrum and gave the flowers to Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao bent down and shook hands with the children earnestly one by one. At this moment, the music rose loudly, and a warm atmosphere moved everyone present. Happy children, you have found the best protectors.

　　热爱领袖，嘲笑敌人
    ——记人民政协第五天大会
    在人民政协第五天大会上，许多代表无情地嘲笑了中外反动派。郭沫若发言时，以诗意深浓的句子说：我们“对于美帝国主义不存丝毫的幻想，也不存丝毫的恐怖。美帝国主义这只纸老虎已经戳穿了。我们今后还要继续努力的戳，戳得它遍体鳞伤，不成形状。”昨天发言的二十位代表中，有四、五位起义将领。他们也一致地嘲笑了国民党反动派及其头子蒋介石。陈明仁说：“蒋介石不仅是不革命”，而且“是人民的公敌”，他说：“我当然要打倒他。”
    我们的战士最会嘲笑敌人，他们说蒋介石这个“运输队长”的运输任务已近全部完成，他已经在国外找了不少房子，想去作“白华”了。
    打败了敌人，剩下的事情是建设。朱学范发言，保证“为彻底实现全部共同纲领，特别是纲领中全部经济政策而奋斗。”薄一波代表华北六千七百万人民，竭诚拥护人民政协的共同纲领，他向大会保证，“在两年内把农业生产全部恢复到战前水平”，“争取在五年到十年内，有计划有步骤地恢复并改组华北的工业生产”。政协筹备会第六小组向大会建议定北平为首都，把“北平位于华北老解放区内，人民力量雄厚”列为重要理由之一，老解放区愿为新中国的建设贡献更多的力量，新解放区愿向老解放区学习，不久中国全部解放，大建设可以稳步前进了。
    多少代表都表示愿意在不同的岗位上，为共同目标的实现而努力。每个人都尽力把自己份内的事情作好，这就是最好的配合。中国民主促进会首席代表马叙伦说：“我们的民族资本家的利益与国家民族的利益是分不开的，所以必能依据共同纲领的经济政策，合力建设工业化的新中国。”上海各人民团体的两位代表一致嘲笑了敌人的封锁。在敌人还保持统治的时候，我们和它们斗争，“一个人倒下去，千万个人站起来，”终究把它打倒了。现在，敌人小丑跳梁，回光返照，我们“还怕什么？”
    在昨天会场上，人们看见了两种显明对照的情绪：对敌人说不尽的嘲笑和痛恨，对人民领袖说不尽的热爱和关心。内蒙人民代表和穿着彩色蒙装的两位蒙民少女，向人民政协、毛主席及朱总司令献花。代表并致祝词，对毛主席说：“我们象热爱冬天的太阳一样热爱着你。”北平民主妇联筹委会也向毛主席献花，有六个北海托儿所的孩子稚气而天真的走到主席台上，把鲜花送给毛主席。毛主席弯下身子，和孩子们认真的一一握手。这时乐声大作，一片温暖的气氛感动着在场的每一个人。幸福的孩子们，你们找到最好的保护者了。
