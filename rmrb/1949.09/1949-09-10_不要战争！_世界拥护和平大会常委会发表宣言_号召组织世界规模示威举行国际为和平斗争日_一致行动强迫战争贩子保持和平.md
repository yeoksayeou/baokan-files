Xinhua News Agency, Prague, September 9th: The Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress has issued a declaration for the "International Day for Struggle for Peace," calling on the people of all countries to organize large-scale demonstrations worldwide on October 2nd to demonstrate the irresistible power of peace defenders and eliminate the threat to peace posed by warmongers. The full text of the declaration is as follows:

We call upon you, men and women of all countries!

Peace is in danger, just as in August 1914 and September 1939.

Now, as then, a small, despicable group of people greedy for profit and world hegemony—only now armed with atomic bombs—are obstructing peaceful negotiations between the people of one place and the people of another. This small group, in collusion with the governments they employ, is organizing military alliances in preparation for a new world war.

The ratification of the Atlantic Pact, the decision to rearm and strengthen the aggressors and murderers of West Germany and Japan, the support of the most heinous enemies of the people of all countries, and the financial support of Tsaldaris' armed intervention against the Greek people—all of these expose the manufacturers of so-called "defensive" pacts as merely bloodthirsty adventurers. The masterminds of this military alliance system and the conspirators who ceaselessly incite war are impoverishing the people and burdening them with the heavy burden of the arms race.

Workers are facing lower wages, reduced purchasing power, and the misery of unemployment.

The taxes of peasants, artisans, and small merchants are constantly increasing. Volunteer military adventurers are launching police terror around the world, attacking the freedom of the people of all countries. In the various colonies, their exploitation and oppression are increasing.

They hope to quickly plunge humanity into the most brutal war in history. However, it is no longer 1914 or 1939. The people's victory over fascism has greatly strengthened the forces of peace. Today, they have the power to restrain the hands of new war criminals.

Tens of millions of men and women, regardless of their beliefs, creeds, civilizations, or skin color, are united and determined to defend the lives and freedom of all mankind. They have gathered together in support of the World Peace Congress.

In more than seventy-two countries spread across five continents, they are organizing the forces of peace into a solid bloc.

In many countries, especially in France and Italy, the growing atrocities of war instigators have been met with petitions signed by millions and mass demonstrations.

The activities of these forces of peace have greatly contributed to the convening of the Four-Power Conference and the results achieved at that conference.

However, this is not enough. To eliminate the danger to peace posed by warmongers, the forces of peace must take more resolute and broader actions.

That is why the Committee of the World Peace Congress decided to organize the "International Day for Struggle for Peace" on October 2nd.

October 2nd must be a signal for a greater surge and doubling of activity by the forces of peace.

On October 2nd, you must say: "No War!"

Men and women of all countries, let us show the irresistible power of peace defenders with large-scale demonstrations around the world!

Let us refuse to bear the increasingly heavy burden of unbearable war budgets!

Let us insist that the atrocities that undermine national independence and the freedom of all nations must end!

Workers of physical and mental labor, all men and women of different ages and circumstances, different beliefs and opinions, our lives are equally in danger, because bombs are indiscriminate.

Let us force them to keep the peace! United action can make us invincible.

In the struggle to uphold peace and safeguard life, we will win!

    不要战争！
　　世界拥护和平大会常委会发表宣言
    号召组织世界规模示威举行国际为和平斗争日
    一致行动强迫战争贩子保持和平
    【新华社布拉格九日电】世界拥护和平大会常设委员会顷为“国际和平斗争日”发出宣言，号召各国人民在十月二日组织全世界规模的大示威，表示和平保卫者不可抗拒的力量，驱除战争贩子所造成的对和平的威胁。宣言全文如下：
    我们号召你们，各国的男女们！
    和平在危险中，正如在一九一四年八月和一九三九年九月一样。
    现在和那时候一样，小小一群可鄙的贪图利润和世界霸权的人——只是现在已经用原子弹武装起来了——正在阻碍着这一个地方的人民和另一个地方人民之间的和平谈判。这一小群家伙在他们所雇佣的政府同谋之下，正在组织着准备新的世界战争的军事同盟。
    大西洋公约的批准，重新武装和加强西德和日本的侵略者与杀人犯的决定，支持各国人民最可恶的敌人，在财政上支持曹达利斯对希腊人民的武装干涉。由帝国主义野心所挑起和延长的殖民地战争——这一切都暴露了所谓“防御性”公约的伪善的制造者们只是嗜杀的冒险家而已。这个军事联盟体制的主使者和永不休止地煽动战争的阴谋家，正在使人民沦于贫困，使他们负担军备竞赛的重担。
    工人们正面临着更低微的工资、购买力的减低和失业的惨象。
    农民，手工业者和小商人的捐税不断在增加。志愿的军事冒险家正在全世界发动警察恐怖，进攻各国人民的自由。在各个殖民地，他们的剥削和压迫正在有加无已。
    他们希望急遽地把人类推到空前最残酷的战争里去。然而，现在已不再是一九一四年或一九三九年了。人民对法西斯的胜利，已大大地增强了和平力量，今天，他们有力量去扼住新战争罪犯的手。
    数以万万计的男女，不分主张、信仰、文明或肤色，都团结一致，并且决意保卫全人类的生活和自由，他们已经团聚在一起，拥护世界和平大会。
    在散布于五大洲的七十二个以上的国家中，他们正组织着和平的力量，使之成为一个巩固的集团。
    在许多国家，特别是在法国和意大利，战争挑拨者日益增长的暴行，遭遇到了千百万人签名的请愿书和群众示威游行的回答。
    这些和平力量的活动，大大促成了四强会议的召开，和该会议所获得的成果。
    然而，这还是不够的。为了驱除战争贩子所造成的和平的危险，要求和平力量进行更坚决更广泛的行动。
    这就是为什么世界拥护和平大会委员会决定在十月二日组织“国际为和平而斗争日”的原因。
    十月二日必须是和平力量更加高涨及加倍活动的信号。
    在十月二日，你们要说：“不要战争”！
    各国的男女们，让我们以全世界的规模宏大的示威来表示和平保卫者的不可抗拒的力量吧！
    让我们拒绝担负沉重不堪的战争预算这一日益加重的担子吧！
    让我们坚持：破坏民族独立与各民族自由的暴行必须终止！
    体力和脑力的劳动者们，年龄与处境不同、信仰与主张不同的一切男女们，我们的生命都同样危险，因为炸弹是不认人的。
    让我们强迫他们保持和平！团结一致的行动能够使我们成为不可征服的。
    在拥护和平、维护生命的斗争中，我们将赢得胜利！
