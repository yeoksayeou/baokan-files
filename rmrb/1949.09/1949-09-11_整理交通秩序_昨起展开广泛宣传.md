　　Organizing Traffic Order
　　Yesterday Began Extensive Publicity
    [This City News] The Municipal Public Security Bureau started organizing the city's traffic order yesterday (the 10th). Private radio stations in the city, such as Minsheng, Junyou, Huasheng, and China, in coordination with the traffic organization work, also broadcast the Municipal Government's public notice, the Municipal Public Security Bureau's announcement, traffic rules, and basic traffic knowledge on their respective stations starting yesterday. Artists from the Quyi Association, such as Hou Yichen, are working on compiling drum lyrics related to organizing traffic, which will be performed on radio stations and at variety shows. Simultaneously with the Municipal Public Security Bureau's organization of traffic order, the Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce, district offices, and vendors' management offices will appropriately organize and ban vendors who have scattered from various vendors' markets to the streets and are obstructing traffic, based on the specific circumstances.
    [Further News] The Beijing Traffic Safety Campaign has been launched enthusiastically. Yesterday (the 10th), the Public Security Bureau and the Tram Company dispatched two publicity trucks and one broadcasting truck to circulate through major streets of the city, reading traffic safety slogans to citizens and distributing leaflets. When the publicity trucks arrived in front of Tiananmen Square, they also gave publicity lectures to the large group of workers and students repairing the square. Wherever the trucks went, citizens gathered to watch and eagerly read the leaflets, which was very effective. When the truck shouted "Pedestrians should walk on the sidewalks," pedestrians on the road immediately went to the sidewalks. At Dengshikou, when the truck shouted "Tricycle drivers should park in designated areas," several tricycles that were not parked in designated areas immediately moved away on their own accord. The 114 members of the Traffic Team of the Inner Seventh Precinct decided to suspend their rest days from the 10th to the 20th to engage in traffic safety publicity work.
    [Further News] Workers of the Beijing Tram Company, in order to improve traffic order and prevent traffic accidents, formed the Vehicle and Road Traffic Safety Campaign Committee on the 6th, which has publicity and inspection groups to educate themselves and raise public awareness. Starting yesterday (the 10th), the company began assisting the Public Security Bureau in launching a traffic safety publicity campaign for citizens, and also assisted the repair factory in inspecting vehicle safety equipment.

　　整理交通秩序
　  昨起展开广泛宣传
    【本市讯】市公安局自昨（十）日起开始整理本市交通秩序。本市民生、军友、华声、中国等私营电台，为配合整理交通工作，亦于昨日起分别在各电台广播市府布告、市公安局通告、交通规则和交通常识等。曲艺公会艺人侯一尘等，正着手编制有关整理交通之鼓词等，将分别在电台及杂耍场演唱。与市公安局整理交通秩序同时，市府工商局、各区公所及各摊贩管理处等，对自各摊贩市场流散到各街头妨害交通的摊贩，将依据具体情况，作适当整理及取缔。
    【又讯】北平交通安全运动，已热烈展开。昨（十日）公安局及电车公司，出动宣传卡车两辆、广播车一辆，环行全市各大街道，向市民宣读交通安全口号，并散发传单。宣传车到天安门前时，并对修整广场的大批工人学生作宣传讲演。车行处，市民围观，争阅传单，收效很大。车上喊“行人走便道时”，马路上的行人马上就到便道上去了。在灯市口车上喊“三轮车夫应按指定地点停车”，几辆没有停在指定地点的三轮车，马上自动的推走了。内七分局交通队一百一十四人，决定自十日起到二十日止，停止休息，从事交通安全的宣传工作。
    【又讯】北平电车公司工人，为了改善交通秩序，防止车祸，已于六日组成车路交通安全运动委员会，设有宣传组及检修组，一面教育自己，一面提高市民警觉。自昨（十日）起，该公司已开始协助公安局，展开对市民的交通安全宣传运动，同时并协助修造厂检查车辆防险设备。
