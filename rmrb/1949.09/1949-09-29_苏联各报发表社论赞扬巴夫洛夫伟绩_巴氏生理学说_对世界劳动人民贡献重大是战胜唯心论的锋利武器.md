Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 28th: Moscow News: September 26th marked the 100th anniversary of the birth of the great Soviet physiologist Pavlov. Newspapers such as *Pravda*, *Izvestia*, *Trud*, and *Red Star* all published commemorative editorials.

　　*Pravda's* editorial pointed out: This great scientist, through years of work, created a new era in physiology, establishing a clear materialistic understanding and belief in biology, namely, the belief that life, despite its most complex manifestations, is material and knowable. He resolutely took the path of a materialistic natural scientist, the path of correct physiological experiments. He used accurate and irrefutable facts as sharp weapons to fight against reactionary idealists in the biological community. Even today, Pavlov's teachings are the sharpest weapon in the attack on the idealistic and reactionary theories of bourgeois lackeys with degrees in the United States and Britain. *Pravda* further pointed out: Lenin gave a high evaluation of Pavlov's work and signed a decree in 1921 stating that Pavlov's scientific work made significant contributions to the world's working people. Comrade Stalin also gave great assistance to Pavlov's scientific research and had a special laboratory built for him. The Communist Party and the Soviet government created various conditions for the fruitful work of this great scientist.

　　*Izvestia's* editorial stated: Pavlov's entire scientific activity and his discoveries are the pride of Soviet science. The Soviet people commemorate the centenary of Pavlov's birth, which is also a celebration of the victory of Soviet science and the victory of the materialistic world view.
