　　Soong Ching-ling's Speech
  　Sino-Soviet Cooperation is a Powerful Guarantee of the Victory of Peace and Democracy
    [Our newspaper reports] Madam Sun Yat-sen, Soong Ching-ling's speech at the preparatory committee of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association's general assembly: "Twenty-four years ago, Sun Yat-sen left us his heartfelt wish, asking us to cooperate closely with the Soviet Union, China's only friend. We must all remember how joyfully he greeted the October Revolution and how enthusiastically he advocated cooperation with the Chinese Communist Party. Today, twenty-four years later, his wish has finally come true. We can now look forward to the future, engage in construction and restoration work, and build a new world of people's culture and social progress, joining hands with the people of our great ally, the Soviet Union, as comrades.
    The goals pursued by the Xinhai Revolution have finally been realized today. This time there will be no turning back, because today's revolutionary leaders are faithful to reality. Today's revolutionary leaders are carrying out revolutionary tasks and have gained the complete trust and cooperation of the Chinese people.
    Sino-Soviet friendship and the Atlantic Pact, as well as the so-called Pacific Alliance, are built on completely opposite foundations. The Atlantic Pact is merely an activity of the cold upper-level diplomatic circles, using a militarily and economically powerful government to force weak countries to accept its orders. Its purpose is destruction and economic aggression. The Marshall Plan is to dump surplus materials that the United States does not need on the European market, destroying the production and industry of European countries, in order to alleviate the domestic crisis in the United States.
    Sino-Soviet friendship is based on the broad masses of the people: the people of China and the Soviet Union cooperate closely and deeply understand each other's common goals. This friendship means construction and mutual assistance to eliminate the trauma left by the Second World War and to build a people's economy. Both China and the Soviet Union have suffered indescribable pain from the great destruction of the war. Therefore, they can jointly seek peace and unity, without doubting each other's motives, believing that the people themselves can control their own destiny and create a new era in history. Sino-Soviet cooperation is a powerful guarantee of the victory of peace and democracy. The people of the two countries unite together and can overcome all difficulties. Therefore, we must strengthen and consolidate the friendship between the people of the two countries in order to smash the conspiracies of the creators of a new world war. Long live Sino-Soviet friendship and cooperation!"

　　宋庆龄讲话
  　中苏合作是和平与民主胜利的有力保证
    【本报讯】孙夫人宋庆龄女士在中苏友好协会总会筹备委员会上的讲话：“二十四年前，孙中山先生把他衷心的愿望遗下给我们，要我们和中国唯一的友人苏联亲密合作。我们一定都记得，他曾怎样欢愉地迎接十月革命，热烈地主张和中国共产党合作。二十四年后的今天，他的愿望终于实现了。我们现在可以展望未来，从事建设与复兴的工作，建立一个人民文化与社会进步的新世界，和我们伟大的盟友苏联人民作为同志，携手并进。
    辛亥革命所追求的目标，终于在今天实现了。这一次不会再倒退了，因为今天的革命领袖忠实于现实。今天的革命领袖执行革命任务，获得了中国人民的完全信任和合作。
    中苏友谊和大西洋公约、以及所谓太平洋同盟是建立在完全相反的基础上的。大西洋公约只是冷酷的上层外交界的活动，以一个军力上经济上强大的政府来强逼弱国接受它的命令。它的目的是破坏和经济侵略。马歇尔计划就是把美国不需要的剩余物资倾销欧洲市场，破坏欧洲国家的生产和工业，以缓和美国国内的危机。
    中苏友谊以广大人民为基础：中苏两国人民亲密地携手合作，深切了解彼此间的共同目标。这种友谊意味着建设与互助，以清除第二次世界大战留下的创伤，建立人民经济。中苏两国在战争的大破坏中都曾受到难以描述的苦痛。因此，他们也就能够共同谋取和平与团结，不会怀疑双方的动机，相信人民自己能够主宰自己的命运，创造历史的新纪元。中苏合作是和平与民主胜利的有力保证。两国人民团结在一起，就能够克服一切困难。因此，我们必须加强和巩固两国人民的友谊，以粉碎世界新战争制造者的阴谋。中苏友谊与合作万岁！”
