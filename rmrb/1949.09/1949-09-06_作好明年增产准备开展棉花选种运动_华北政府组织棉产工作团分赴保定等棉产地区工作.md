Preparing for Increased Production Next Year and Launching a Cotton Seed Selection Campaign
　　North China Government Organizes Cotton Production Work Groups to Work in Cotton Producing Areas Such as Baoding

[Our Newspaper’s News] In order to improve the quality of raw cotton, ensure industrial raw materials, and prepare for a large increase in cotton production next year, the Agricultural Department of the North China People's Government has launched a mass seed selection campaign in all cotton-producing areas, and is conducting seed selection and separate harvesting campaigns in the fine seed management areas and fine seed promotion areas. The aim is to select fine seeds from the existing millions of mu of Si Zi No. 4 cotton and other American cottons to supply for the sowing of ten million mu of cotton fields, so that the production of raw cotton will be initially standardized next year. From the existing 230,000 mu of Si Zi No. 2 cotton, fine seed selection and separate harvesting will be carried out, and the masses will be organized to retain seeds themselves. Through transportation, sales, and processing, the fine seeds will be expanded and promoted, so that the Si Zi No. 2 cotton bred in this region will be expanded to 800,000 to 1 million mu. In order to complete this task, the Agricultural Department has decided that all technical cadres of the North China Cotton Production Improvement Office, cotton technical cadres of the Cotton Crop Department of the North China Agricultural Science Research Institute, and some professors and lecturers from the agricultural colleges of Peking University and Tsinghua University, a total of more than 30 people, will form cotton production work groups, divided into eight groups. They departed on September 1st to cotton-producing areas such as Zhao Baoding, Shijiazhuang, Handan, Anyang, Shulu, and Linqing to cooperate with local administrative cadres and cotton planting guidance areas and technical personnel from various agricultural experiment stations and promotion stations to organize ordinary seed selection and fine seed selection and separate harvesting work in the fine seed areas, and to select several typical villages for cotton production professional surveys, in order to formulate next year's cotton production plan.
