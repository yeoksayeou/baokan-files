Tianjin Industry and Commerce's Recovery and Development
By our Tianjin Correspondent Wei Jin

(1) The Status of Industry and Commerce's Recovery and Development in the Past Six Months

Tianjin is the industrial and commercial center of North China. The recovery and development of Tianjin's industry and commerce is of great significance to the economic construction of the North China region and even neighboring regions. In the past six months, under the guidance of the People's Government's general policy of "developing production, promoting economic prosperity, considering both public and private interests, and benefiting both labor and capital," Tianjin's industry and commerce are gradually recovering and developing.

After Tianjin's liberation, the People's Government took over 19 units of Kuomintang's bureaucrat-capital enterprises, including 36 factories and three power plants. These enterprises, now in the hands of the people, have undergone initial transformations and rapidly changed their old appearance. By the end of June this year, all factories had not only restored their original production levels, but many had also exceeded the levels during the Kuomintang rule.

	Product	Unit	Average Daily Output in 1948	Average Daily Output in June 1949	Percentage Increase
	Cotton Yarn	Pound	215,983	263,305	21.91%
	Washing Soda	Dan	2,047	2,642	29.06%
	Sodium Sulfide	Kilogram	4,305	7,012	62.88%
	Solid Alkali	Kilogram	1,972	2,763	40.11%
	Bleaching Powder	Kilogram	1,590	3,385	112.89%
	Flour	Kilogram	34,320	66,405	93.48%
	Paper	Pound	28,507	41,728	46.36%
	Glass	Case	700	1,638	132.29%
	Matches	Case	52	96	84.64%
	Tobacco	Case	25	61	144.00%

In the process of restoring production, workers have improved technology, upgraded machinery, saved raw materials, and invented substitutes. In terms of factory management, business operations have been improved. Since the first half of this year, all companies and factories under the Industrial Bureau have had surpluses, totaling approximately 5.8 billion yuan, equivalent to 126,100,000 jin of millet.

In the private industrial sector: According to a survey by the Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce in February, there were originally 6,853 private factories and workshops in the city. In the six months since liberation (by the end of July), 1,143 new factories and workshops have opened, and 27 have closed. After offsetting the openings and closures, there has been a net increase of 1,116 units, accounting for approximately 16.29% of the original 6,853 industrial units. With the gradual recovery of foreign trade and urban-rural trade, Tianjin's industry has seen considerable development, most evident in several major industries. Before liberation, there were 63 rubber factories, most of which were at a standstill due to difficulties in obtaining raw materials and sales channels. Now, they have all fully resumed operations (including two state-owned factories). Since April, the demand for products has exceeded supply. The total output of bicycle inner tubes and tires was 69,840 sets, and the sales volume reached 80,242 sets (including sales of past inventory). Production has exceeded pre-liberation levels. In July 1948, the total output of bicycle tires from all factories was 17,468 sets, while in June this year, it was 38,008 sets. Last year, the monthly output of rubber shoes was 65,076 pairs, while this year, the monthly output is 245,702 pairs. Twenty-four factories have added 54 machines. Of the 47 dyeing and finishing businesses in the city, about 20 were operating before liberation. Now, 45 are operating. The industry has a total of 413 dyeing vats. Before liberation, at most 30% were in operation. This May, 75% were in operation. Some factories have also added machines. Production has greatly increased. For example, Dahua Dyeing Factory dyed a total of 10,639 bolts of cloth in the second half of last year, and 53,294 bolts in the first half of this year. Of the 29 dye businesses before liberation, 18 were operating. Now, in addition to all of them operating, seven new ones have been added. The industry has a total of 289 machines of various types. In March, 54.77% were in operation, increasing to 76.44% in June. Production efficiency has generally improved. For example, Gongyu Chemical Factory produced 26 barrels of sulfurized green dye per day (each barrel containing 120 jin) before liberation. Now, it produces 36 barrels per day. In the past, May to August was the slow season for this industry. This year, even during this slow season, the demand for products still exceeds supply. Factories are preparing to add machines and expand production. Thirty-three weaving and dyeing businesses, which had been shut down for two to ten years before liberation, have now fully resumed operations. In addition, 235 new businesses have opened. The production and sales volume of the cigarette industry is increasing month by month. In March, 778 cases were produced and 596.47 cases were sold. In June, production increased by 103%, and sales increased by 153%. Of the 52 metal manufacturing businesses, only 20勉强managed to stay open before liberation. This March, 45 were operating. In June, including newly opened businesses, there were 66. In April, the total output was 635 tons, and the total sales volume was 587 tons, accounting for 92% of the total output. The industry has a total of 121 machines. In March, 89 were in operation, and in June, 105 were in operation. Machine factories repairing machinery are very busy. Some factories making complete sets of machinery are overwhelmed with work. For example, Zhijin Machine Factory has received orders from Tianjin and Jinan that are積壓backlogged for two to three months. Zhonghua Industrial Cooperative has received orders for榨油机oil presses from Jizhong, Jilu豫Yu, Kaifeng, Shangqiu, and other places, which will take nine months to complete. From May to July, this industry has added 18 new businesses. In addition, the bakelite, electrical equipment, hardware wire yarn, and copper wire industries are all developing.

Commerce is also gradually developing with the recovery and development of industry and the expansion of urban-rural trade. According to statistics from the Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce in February, there were originally 24,944 commercial establishments in the city. As of the end of July this year, 2,032 new establishments had opened, and 204 had closed. After offsetting the openings and closures, there has been a net increase of 1,828 units, accounting for 7.33% of the original 24,944 commercial establishments. According to a survey by the Bureau of Industry and Commerce of several major industries, the quantity of goods purchased and sold increased month by month from March to May (which are months of relatively normal business development), increasing from 2-3 times to as much as 8 times. For example, for three coal businesses (finding typical large, medium, and small businesses to calculate the average, same below), the purchase volume in March was 564 tons, and the sales volume was 197 tons. In April, the purchase volume was 2,031 tons, and the sales volume was 1,497 tons. In May, the purchase volume was 2,444 tons, and the sales volume was 1,709 tons. For three grain wholesale businesses, the total purchase volume in March was 42,460 jin, and the sales volume was 24,660 jin. In April, the purchase volume was 52,897 jin, and the sales volume was 65,448 jin (the sales volume is larger than the purchase volume because they have already made money, same below). In May, the purchase volume was 124,789 jin, and the sales volume was 128,206 jin. For three general merchandise businesses, the purchase volume in March was 560,000 yuan, and the sales volume was 740,000 yuan. In April, the purchase volume was 720,000 yuan, and the sales volume was 859,000 yuan. In May, the purchase volume was 4,460,000 yuan, and the sales volume was 6,590,000 yuan. In addition, department stores, warehouses, inns, oil merchants, egg merchants, and the transportation industry are all quite prosperous. Many legitimate merchants reflect that "business has improved since liberation, and merchants' spirits are higher than in the past."

In the process of the recovery and development of industry and commerce, those industries and businesses that serve a small number of people and are not conducive to the national economy and the people's livelihood are gradually declining. Under the government's education and assistance, they are actively switching industries. Of the original 55 incense-making businesses, 28 have switched industries due to sluggish business. Of the 178 gold and silver jewelry businesses, 63 have switched or are in the process of switching industries. Of the original 110 antique painting and calligraphy businesses, 75 have added new businesses due to the sluggishness of the original business. Of the original 68 jewelry and jade businesses, 61 have added other businesses due to the difficulty of switching industries. Department stores and general merchandise stores are changing their business content: reducing imported goods and increasing domestic products. As for the silk, pastry, phonograph, and hat industries, because fewer are switching industries or closing down, business is decreasing day by day.

In addition, some merchants in certain industries have closed down because they were engaged in speculative activities with no way out, including 37 businesses in the yarn and cloth industry, 21 in the general merchandise industry, 17 in the coal industry, and 10 in the grain industry. Before liberation, illegitimate businesses specializing in speculation under false names are now dissolving and closing down one after another, totaling 352 businesses in the yarn and cloth industry, grain wholesale industry, and kerosene industry. This change is beneficial to the operation of legitimate industry and commerce and the establishment of a new economic order.

(2) Implementing the "Four Sides, Eight Directions" Policy is the Key to Developing Industry and Commerce

Tianjin's industry and commerce have long been in decline under the long-term aggression, exploitation, and monopoly of imperialism and Kuomintang bureaucrat-capital. The so-called prosperity was nothing more than a畸形abnormal state. Today, the reason why industry and commerce have been able to rapidly change their old appearance and move forward along the path of normal recovery and development is all due to the People's Government's implementation of the "Four Sides, Eight Directions" economic policy.

First, foreign trade is independent and autonomous, eliminating imperialist economic aggression and stimulating the development of national industries. In the past, foreign trade was basically in a state of trade deficit. Exports were industrial raw materials, and imports were luxury consumer goods. Now, under the guidance of the People's Government's policy of "encouraging exports and limiting imports," the situation has greatly changed. According to statistics from the North China Foreign Trade Administration from March 18 to June 20, the total value of imports and exports was 10,290,821,917 yuan, of which imports were 4,485,278,969 yuan, accounting for a little less than 44% of the total value, and exports were 5,805,542,948 yuan, accounting for a little more than 55% of the total value, resulting in a relative trade surplus of 1.32 billion yuan. The main export goods are rural local products and processed semi-finished products, such as carpets, cloth, cashmere, vegetable oil, egg products, mountain products, and bristles. The main import goods are machinery and raw materials for restoring industry, such as dyes, chemical products, metals and their products, paper, rubber, new and old burlap bags, machine tools, and vehicles. This kind of foreign trade that is beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood has played a certain role in the recovery and development of industry and commerce. The export industries of egg products, oils and fats, mountain products, and alcohol are also improving day by day. Industries that were depressed by the dumping of imperialist goods in the past are beginning to recover. For example, the paper industry, since the recent restriction on the import of foreign paper, factories are改装 modifying machines to improve quality and prepare to compete with foreign paper. Yuzhong Photographic Plate Factory, which produced some finished products before liberation but had to stop production in 1946 due to the打击impact of American goods, is now repairing machines and preparing to start production in the short term. Industries that manufacture various industrial glues to replace foreign goods, such as fish scale glue, printing glue, and造软胶soft glue, are constantly emerging.

Second, urban-rural trade is initially connected, so that industrial products can go to the countryside and agricultural products can enter the city. Under the long-term rule of Kuomintang bureaucrat-capital in Tianjin, speculation was rampant and resources were exhausted. At the beginning of liberation, the People's Government, on the one hand, strengthened financial management and grain market management with administrative power, guaranteeing the legitimate operations of legitimate merchants and banning the illegal transactions of hoarding and speculation. On the other hand, state-owned trading agencies supplied sufficient living and production materials. For example, they successively transported more than 200 million jin of grain (including oil crops) and 40 million jin of cotton to Tianjin. In addition, private merchants were organized to successively transport 200 million jin of grain and more than 5 million jin of cotton to Tianjin. In the six months since Tianjin's liberation, there were three months when prices were stable, and although prices fluctuated during the other three months, the government finally found ways to restore stability. Because prices were relatively stable, industrial production had profits and was happy to produce, and industrial products flowed into the market steadily. Because prices were relatively stable, the commercial sector also had profits and actively engaged in material exchanges, so that material exchanges could generally proceed according to the normal laws of circulation. Urban-rural trade gradually developed on this basis. In the past six months, state-owned trading agencies and private merchants have jointly organized industrial products to go to the countryside and agricultural products to enter the city, achieving certain results. According to incomplete statistics, the trust company operated by the Municipal Trading Company has been entrusted by more than 300 public production units in various liberated areas to purchase or transport agricultural products to exchange for military industrial equipment and industrial products. The transaction volume from February to mid-June was more than 3 billion yuan. The cooperative warehouse operated by the Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative has had more than 50 cooperatives from various places come to exchange materials. From March to May, the railway transported a total of 519,421 tons of coal, cotton, pig iron, peanuts, wool, etc., and transported out a total of 95,067 tons of coal, grain, yarn, cloth, paper, alkali, etc. A total of 18,472 inland river transport vessels, carrying 591,978 tons of grain, cotton, vegetables, fresh goods, and fish oil, etc. into Tianjin, and 588,948 tons of fertilizer, grain, salt, groceries, and industrial products, etc. out of Tianjin.

Third, the policy of considering both public and private interests is initially implemented. First, the problem of the lack of raw materials in factories, which had been squeezed for a long time by the enemy, was solved. Under the guidance of the government, the Municipal Grain Company and 24 private flour mills jointly organized a Wheat Purchasing and Flour Selling Committee to solve the difficulty of purchasing wheat. After the trade department guaranteed the supply of cotton to China Textile, the cotton freed up in the market was supplied to private yarn factories. The Municipal Trade Agency's Yarn and Cloth Company dumped and rationed a large amount of cotton yarn, so that the raw materials of dyeing and weaving factories were solved. The Pingjin Coal and Iron Company purchased iron materials from the Northeast and Taiyuan to supply the raw materials for the machinery manufacturing industry. The straw, which is the most used raw material for paper mills, was also assisted by the Bureau of Industry and Commerce and the Tianjin County Government to solve. Some factories lacked funds and could not produce, and the trade department adopted a substitute processing method to assist them. For example, the Municipal Grain Company supplied a total of 46,058,853 jin of raw materials (grain, refined grain) to the three major private flour mills in Dongya, Shoufeng, and Fuxing and 508磨房mills, processing and milling 51,436,466 jin of flour, enabling them to restore production. In March, the Yarn and Cloth Company organized more than a dozen weaving factories to try to process yarn on loan. In June, it signed processing contracts with 63 private textile factories, paying out 1,139 pieces of cotton yarn and收回recovering 19,647.5匹standard cloth, solving the difficulty of capital turnover for various factories. Second, the method of ordering finished products and assisting sales was adopted to help factories sell finished products. At the beginning of liberation, in order to enable certain factories to sell their accumulated finished products, the Municipal Trade Agency acquired yarn and cloth from the three major private textile mills in Beiyang, Hengyuan, and Dasheng, telephones from Zhongtian Electric Factory, and pigments from Dafeng Chemical Factory. From April to July, the department store of the Municipal Trade Agency established ordering relationships with nearly 100 companies in the knitting, rubber, soap making, toothbrush, tooth powder, and stationery industries. In May, the trust company helped Yongli Alkali Factory, Lireng Paper Factory, Dongya, and Dazhong and other factories sell finished products. Third, the People's Bank carried out large-scale loans (mainly in the form of orders and real value) on the principle of mutual benefit to solve the capital difficulties of public and private factories and mines. From liberation to the end of May, a total of 3,884,564,901.26 yuan was lent, of which state-owned commerce accounted for 25.4%, state-owned industry and mining accounted for 17.1%, private industry accounted for 24.19%, domestic exports accounted for 26.24%, and private commerce accounted for the rest. In June, the Bank of Communications lent a total of 371,157,727.27 yuan, of which state-owned industry and mining accounted for 50.79%, and private industry accounted for 49.21%.

Fourth, the policy of benefiting both labor and capital is initially implemented. At the beginning of liberation, the industrial sector, under the long-term deception and propaganda of the Kuomintang reactionaries, did not fully understand the government's policy of developing industry and commerce, and had many concerns. In April, Comrade Liu Shaoqi came to Tianjin and clearly and definitely explained the policy of benefiting both labor and capital, reducing many unnecessary concerns for people in the industrial sector. Some workers also began to understand that uniting the industrial sector to implement the policy of benefiting both labor and capital was to develop production. In general, labor-capital relations were relatively normal. Some people in the industrial sector saw the bright future of private industry and began to transform and actively operate. A notable example is Renli Industrial Company, which transferred 400,000 US dollars existing abroad back to prepare to participate in production. Some factories also went overseas to purchase machinery.

(3) To Push Industry and Commerce Further, It is Necessary to Continue to Implement Policies

Looking back at Tianjin's industry and commerce in the past six months, it is clear that it has broken away from the economic aggression of imperialism and the monopoly of Kuomintang bureaucrat-capital. The so-called semi-colonial nature and畸形abnormal prosperity have become a thing of the past. It is moving towards a golden age of normal recovery and development. This is a watershed moment in Tianjin's history. Far-sighted industrialists and businessmen have already -- or are in the process of -- seeing their bright and promising future in this great change.

However, Tianjin's industry and commerce are still in the early stage of recovery and development. It must be pushed further forward in order to shoulder the important mission of current economic construction. To push forward, it is very important to solve some of the current difficult problems.

The current difficulties existing in Tianjin's industry and commerce mainly include: First, there are phenomena such as unreasonable wage adjustments in some places, which affect the lack of normal labor-capital relations. The industrial sector is still concerned about investing in enterprises, so there are not many large-scale enterprises. According to a survey by the Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce of 843 newly opened factories, 80% are small factories and handicraft processing producers. Among them, those with capital below 200,000 yuan accounted for 65% of the total number of newly opened factories, those with capital between 200,000 yuan and 600,000 yuan accounted for 23%, and slightly larger-scale factories with capital above 600,000 yuan accounted for about 10%. The largest capital of a Hongda Weaving Factory was 20 million yuan. According to a survey of 819 newly opened commercial establishments by the Bureau of Industry and Commerce, most of them are small businesses, and there are fewer medium-sized businesses. For example, those with capital below 100,000 yuan accounted for 67% of the total number of 819 establishments, those with capital between 100,000 yuan and 1 million yuan accounted for 30.2%, and those with capital above 1 million yuan accounted for 2.8%. The largest capital of a department store was 4 million yuan. In addition, due to the lack of normal labor-capital relations, it has also affected the fact that some factories have not improved production since liberation, such as the three major private yarn factories in Beiyang, Hengyuan, and Dasheng. In March, the daily production efficiency of yarn was 0.633 pounds, in April it was 0.621 pounds, and in May it was 0.637 pounds. The daily production efficiency of cloth was 60.39 yards in March, 53.30 yards in April, and 55.20 yards in May. Second, in terms of urban-rural cooperation and internal and external exchanges, there is generally a lack of organization and planning (such as the lack of a unified production, purchase, and sales plan for public and private industrial production), which hinders the supply of raw materials and the sales of products to varying degrees. Third, there are still unreasonable phenomena in tax collection in some places. These are all current difficulties in developing industry and commerce. To break through these difficulties, it is necessary to continue to implement policies! First, implement the policy of benefiting both labor and capital. On the one hand, conscientiously educate cadres, clear their minds, and clearly recognize the important significance of the policy of benefiting both labor and capital under the new democratic economic system, so that the policy can be implemented among the masses. On the other hand, workers must quickly improve the trade unions in various industries, and the industrial sector must organize trade associations. Based on these two organizations, a collective contract for the industry can be jointly formulated, so that both labor and capital have a jointly agreed standard, eliminating disputes and smoothly carrying out production. This People's Representative Conference seriously discussed the "Draft Measures for Handling Labor-Capital Disputes," which will be of great help in resolving future labor-capital disputes. Second, it is necessary to implement the policy of considering both public and private interests. In the past, the Municipal Food Company and private flour mills organized a wheat purchase and sales committee to unify the purchase of wheat and agree on flour prices. The Yarn and Cloth Company allocated yarn and collected cloth for dyeing and weaving factories. The government assisted grain merchants in solving the difficulties of transportation and purchase procedures, so that they could purchase a large amount of grain and sell industrial products. The Bureau of Industry and Commerce assisted the match, bakelite, pigment, and rubber industries in trial-running collective contracting and collective procurement methods to purchase raw materials from home and abroad. These are all relatively organized and planned ways to solve purchase and sales problems. In the future, these methods should be extended to various industries. At the same time, the most important aspect of implementing the policy of considering both public and private interests is that the government must assist in the transformation of private industry. In the past, some industries did not have raw materials in this country, and some industries did not have a market in this country. The supply of raw materials and the sales of products had to rely on foreign countries, forming a semi-colonial economy. Today, we must follow Chairman Mao's instructions, implement the policy of "self-reliance and hard work," break the psychology of relying on imperialism, establish the concept of facing the countryside and facing the broad masses of the people, so that urban industry and commerce can break away from imperialist shackles and develop soundly.

　　天津工商业的恢复与发展
    本报驻津记者  维进
   （一）半年来工商业的恢复与发展状况
    天津为华北工商业中心。天津工商业的恢复与发展，对华北区以至友邻区的经济建设均有重大意义。半年来，在人民政府“发展生产，繁荣经济，公私兼顾，劳资两利”的总方针指导下，天津工商业正在逐渐恢复与向前发展。
    天津解放，人民政府接收国民党的官僚资本企业共十九个单位，包括三十六个厂和三个发电所。这些企业到了人民手里，经过初步改造，迅速改变了旧日面貌。到本年六月底止，各厂不仅恢复了原有产量，有不少厂子且已超过国民党统治时期的水平。产品　单位　三十七年平均日产量　三十八年六月份平均日产量　增加百分率棉纱　　磅　二一五、九八三　　二六三、三○五　　　二一·九一％洗涤盐　担　二、○四七　　　　二、六四二　　　　二九·○六％硫化碱　公斤　　四、三○五　　　　七、○一二　　　六二·八八％固体碱　公斤　　一、九七二　　　　二、七六三　　　四○·一一％漂粉　　公斤　　一、五九○　　　　三、三八五　　一一二·八九％面粉　　公斤　　三四、三二○　　　六六、四○五　　　九三·四八％纸　　　磅　　　二八、五○七　　　四一、七二八　　　四六·三六％玻璃　　箱　　　七○○　　　　一、六三八　　一三二·二九％火柴　　箱　　　五二　　　　　　　九六　　　八四·六四％烟草　　箱　　　二五　　　　　　　六一　　一四四·○○％
    在恢复生产过程中，职工提高了技术，改良了机器，节省了原料，发明了代用品；在工厂管理方面，改进了业务经营。今年上半年以来，工业处所属各公司厂均有盈余，约达五十八亿元，折合小米一二六、一○○、○○○斤。
    在私营工业方面：据市工商局二月份调查，全市原有私营工厂作坊共六、八五三户，解放后半年来（七月底）新开的工厂作坊共一、一四三户，歇业的二七户，开歇相抵，实增一、一一六户，约占原有工业户数六、八五三户的百分之一六·二九。随着对外贸易与城乡贸易的逐渐恢复，天津工业有了相当发展；从几种主要工业看来，表现最为明显。解放前有六十三个橡胶工厂，因原料与销路困难，大部陷于停顿状态，现已完全复工（包括国营的二家）。四月份起，产品供不应求。自行车内胎和外带总产量为六九、八四○付，销售量达八○、二四二付（连过去的存货销售在内）。产量超过解放前的水平。三十七年七月各厂自行车外胎总产量一七、四六八付，今年六月为三八、○○八付；去年月产胶鞋六五、○七六双，今年月产二四五、七○二双。有二四个厂子增添了机器五四台。全市染整业四七户，解放前有二十多户开工，现在开工达四五户。全业共有染槽四一三对，解放前最多开动百分之三十，今年五月已开动百分之七十五。有的厂子还增添了机器。产量大大提高。如大华染厂去年下半年共染布一○、六三九匹，今年半年染五三、二九四匹。染料业解放前二九户中开工一八户，现在除全部开工外，还增加七户。全业共有各种机器二八九台，三月开动百分之五四点七七，六月增至百分之七六点四四。生产效率一般均有提高。如公裕化学厂解放前日产硫化青二六桶（每桶一二○斤），现在日产三六桶。过去每年五月至八月为这一行业的淡月，今年在这淡月中，产品仍供不应求。厂方均准备增装机器，扩大生产。有三十三家织染业解放前曾停工二、三年至十年，现在完全复工；并新开业二三五户。卷烟业产销量逐月增加。三月份产七七八箱，销五九六点四七箱，六月份产量增加百分之一○三，销数增加百分之一五三。五金冶制业五二户，解放前只有二○户勉强维持开工，今年三月开工达四五户，六月份连新开业者增到六六户。四月份总产量六三五吨，销售总量五八七吨，占总产量的百分之九二。全业共有机器一二一部，三月开动八九部，六月开动一○五部。机器业修理机器的工厂生意很旺盛；有一部分做成套机器的工厂忙不过来。如治津机器厂先后接到本市和济南的定货已积压到两三个月；中华工业社接到冀中、冀鲁豫、开封、商邱等地定做的榨油机，九个月才能完成。五月至七月该业已增加十八户。此外电木、电工器材、五金线纱、铜丝罗底等行业都在发展中。
    商业随着工业的恢复与发展及城乡贸易的开展，亦在逐渐发展中。据市工商局二月份统计，全市原有商户二四、九四四户，至今年七月底止，新开业的商户为二、○三二户，歇业的二○四户，开歇相抵，实增一、八二八户，占原有商户数二四、九四四户的百分之七·三三。据工商局对几个主要行业调查，货物进销数量自三月至五月（这是业务比较正常发展的月份）逐月增加；自二、三倍增至八倍不等。如煤业三户（找出比较典型的大、中、小三户平均来看，下同），三月份进货五六四吨，销货一九七吨，四月进货二、○三一吨，销货一、四九七吨，五月进货二、四四四吨，销货一、七○九吨。粮食批发业三户，三月共进货四二、四六○斤，销货二四、六六○斤，四月进货五二、八九七斤，销货六五、四四八斤（销货数所以比进货数大，因已赚钱，下同），五月进货一二四、七八九斤，销货一二八、二○六斤；杂货业三户，三月进货五六○、○○○元，销货七四○、○○○元，四月进货七二○、○○○元，销货八五九、○○○元，五月进货四、四六○、○○○元，销货六、五九○、○○○元。此外百货业、货栈、大车店、油商、鸡子商、运输业等都是相当繁荣，不少正当商人反映说：“解放后买卖好了，商人心气较过去提高了。”
    在工商业恢复与发展过程中，凡是为少数人服务的不利于国计民生的工商业，正在逐渐萧条衰退，在政府教育与协助下，纷纷转业。制香业原有五五户，因生意清淡，转业二八户，金银首饰业共一七八户，转业或正在转业者计六三户，古董书画业原有一一○户，因原业萧条，已增添新业务的计七五户，珠宝玉石业原有六八户，因一时转业困难，添设其他业务者计六一户，百货业、杂货业等经营内容已在改变：减少舶来品，增加国产品。至于绸缎业、糕点业、唱机业、帽业等，因转业与歇业较少，买卖日益减少。
    另外，在某些行业中的商户，因从事投机倒把等无出路的业务而歇业的，计有纱布业三七户，杂货业二一户，煤业一七户，粮食业一○户。解放前以假字号专门从事投机的非正当商业，现在亦纷纷解散歇业，计有纱布业、粮食批发业、煤油业共三五二户。这种变化，对于正当工商业的经营和新经济秩序的建立都有好处。
    （二）贯彻“四面八方”政策，是发展工商业的关键
    天津工商业在帝国主义与国民党官僚资本长期侵略、压榨、垄断之下，早已一蹶不振，所谓繁荣，不过是一种畸形状态。今天工商业所以能够迅速改变旧日面貌，循着正常恢复与发展的途径前进，皆由于人民政府贯彻“四面八方”经济政策的结果。
    首先是对外贸易独立自主，消除帝国主义的经济侵略，刺激起民族工业的发展。过去对外贸易，基本上是入超状态；出口为工业原料，入口为奢侈消耗品。现在对外贸易在人民政府“奖出限入”政策的指导下，情况大为改变。据华北对外贸易管理局自三月十八日至六月二十日统计，进出口总值一○、二九○、八二一、九一七元，其中进口四、四八五、二七八、九六九元，占总值百分之四四弱，出口五、八○五、五四二、九四八元，占总值百分之五五强，相对出超十三亿二千万元。出口物资主要为农村土产和加工半制品，如地毯、匹头、羊绒毛、植物油、蛋品、山货、猪鬃，进口物资主要为恢复工业的机器、原料，如染料颜料、化学制品、金属及其制品、纸类、橡胶、新旧麻袋、机器工具、车辆船艇等。这种有利于国计民生的对外贸易，对于工商业的恢复与发展起了一定作用。蛋品、油腊、山货、酒等出口行业，也日益好转；过去受帝国主义货物倾销而不振的工业开始抬头。如纸业，自近来限制外纸入口后，各厂正在改装机器，提高品质，准备与外纸抗争；裕中照像底板工厂，解放前制出一些成品，因遭美货打击，民国三十五年已停工，现在正修擦机器，准备于短期内开工；制造油烟古力斯的各种工业用胶，如鱼鳞胶、印刷胶、造软胶等代替外货的工业，都在不断涌现出来。
    其次，初步沟通城乡贸易，使工业品下乡，农产品入市。天津在国民党官僚资本长期统治下，投机严重，物资枯竭。解放之初，人民政府一方面以行政力量加强金融管理与粮食市场管理；保证正当商人的合法经营，取缔囤积投机的非法交易；一方面由国营贸易机关供给充足的生活资料与生产资料，如：先后运入津市粮食二亿多斤（包括油料）、棉花四千万斤，另外组织私商先后运入津市粮食二亿斤，棉花五百余万斤。天津解放半年来，有三个月的时间是物价稳定的，有三个月时间虽然物价波动，但政府终于设法使之恢复稳定。由于物价比较稳定，工业生产有了利润，乐于生产，工业品源源流入市场；由于物价比较稳定，商业界也有利润，积极进行物资交流，使得物资交流大体上能按照正常地流转的规律进行。城乡贸易便在这基础上逐渐开展。半年来国营贸易机关及私商共同组织工业品下乡，农产品入市，获得一定的成绩。据不完全统计，市贸易公司经营的信托公司，有各个解放区的三百多个公营生产单位委托代购——或运来农产品委托交换军工器材与工业品，二月至六月中旬成交量三十余亿元。市供销总社经营的合作货栈，有各地五十多个合作社到来交换物资。三月至五月，铁路运进煤、棉花、生铁、花生米、羊毛等共五一九、四二一吨，运出煤、粮食、纱、布、纸张、碱面等共九五、○六七吨。五条内河运输船共一八、四七二只，入津载重粮食、棉花、蔬菜、鲜货、鱼油等共五九一、九七八吨，出津载重肥料、粮食、食盐、杂货、工业品等共五八八、九四八吨。
    第三，初步贯彻公私兼顾政策。首先解决了各厂在敌人长期压榨下缺乏原料的问题。在政府指导下，市粮食公司与全市二十四家私营面粉厂共同组织购麦销粉委员会，解决收购小麦的困难；贸易部门保证供给中纺棉花后，腾出市场的棉花供给了私营纱厂；市贸易机关的纱布公司大量抛售与配售棉纱，使织染厂的原料得到解决；平津煤铁公司向东北、太原购买铁料，供给了机器制造业的原料；造纸厂所用最多的原料稻草，也由工商局及天津县政府协助解决。有些工厂缺乏资金无法生产，贸易部门采取代替加工方式，予以扶助。如市粮食公司供给东亚、寿丰、福星三大私营面粉厂及五百零八家磨房的原料（粮，细粮）共四六、○五八、八五三斤，加工磨粉五一、四三六、四六六斤，使他们得以恢复生产；纱布公司三月间曾组织十余个织布工厂，试作贷纱加工，六月份和六三个私营纺织厂订立加工合同，付出棉纱一、一三九件，收回标准布一九、六四七·五匹，解决各厂资金周转的困难。其次，采取订购成品协助推销方式，帮助各厂推销成品。解放初期，市贸易机关为使某些工厂积压的成品得以推销，曾收购北洋、恒源、达生三大私营纺织厂的纱布、中天电机厂的电话机及大丰化学厂的颜料等；市贸易机关的百货公司自四月至七月曾于针织、橡胶、造胰、牙刷、牙粉、文具等业将近百余家建立订货关系，信托公司五月里曾帮助永利碱厂、立仁造纸厂、东亚、大中等工厂推销成品。第三，人民银行在双方有利的原则下进行大批贷款（主要是定货、折实方式），解决公私营厂矿的资金困难。自解放至五月底，共贷出三、八八四、五六四、九○一·二六元，计公营商业占百分之二五点四，公营工矿占百分之一七点一，私营工业占百分之二四点一九，国内出口占百分之二六点二四，其他还有私营商业等。六月份交通银行共贷出三七一、一五七、七二七·二七元，计公营工矿占百分之五○点七九，私营工业占百分之四九点二一。
    第四，初步贯彻劳资两利政策。解放初期，产业界在国民党反动派长期欺骗宣传下，对政府发展工商业政策不大了解，存在许多顾虑。四月刘少奇同志来津，明确肯定的阐明劳资两利政策，产业界人士减少许多不必要的顾虑，一些工人也开始了解联合产业界实行劳资两利政策是为了发展生产，一般的说劳资关系较为正常。若干产业界人士都看到私人工业发展的光明前途，开始转变，积极经营。显著的如仁立实业公司，将存在外国的四十万元美金，调回准备参加生产，有些工厂还到海外购买机器。
    （三）要把工商业推进一步，必须继续贯彻政策
    回顾天津半年来的工商业，很明显地看出，它已摆脱帝国主义的经济侵略，摆脱国民党官僚资本的垄断，所谓半殖民地性和畸形的繁荣，已经成为过去，它正在走向正常恢复与发展的黄金时代，这是天津有史以来一个划时代的大变化。有远见的工商业家已经——或者正在——在这个大变化中看出自己光明远大的前途。
    但是，天津工商业毕竟还是处在恢复与发展初期，必须向前推进一步，才能负起当前经济建设的重大使命；而要向前推进一步，解决现时若干困难问题非常重要。
    现时天津工商业存在的困难主要有：第一，有些地方存在工资未曾合理调整等现象，影响劳资关系不够正常，产业界对于投资企业还有所顾虑，因而稍具规模的企业发展不多。据市工商局对新开业的八四三户工厂的调查，有百分之八十为小型工厂及手工业加工生产者；这里面资本在二十万元以下者占新开业总数百分之六十五，二十万元以上六十万元以下者占百分之二十三，六十万元以上稍具规模的工厂约占百分之十，资本最大的一家宏大织布厂为二千万元。据工商局从新开业商户里的八一九户调查，大部分为小商，中等商较少。如：资本十万元以下者占八一九户总数的百分之六十七，十万元以上百万元以下者，占百分之三十点二，百万元以上者占百分之二点八，资本最大的一户百货业为四百万元。另外，由于劳资关系不够正常，也影响一些工厂解放以来生产没有提高。如北洋、恒源、达生三大民营纱厂。三月份纱的每天生产效率○·六三三磅，四月份○·六二一磅，五月份○·六三七磅，布的每天生产效率三月份六○·三九码，四月份五三·三○码，五月份五五·二○码。第二，在城乡互助与内外交流上，一般的说尚缺乏组织性与计划性（如公私营工业生产，缺乏统一的产、购、销计划）致使原料的供给，产品的推销，都多少受到妨碍。第三，税收工作在某些地方尚存在不合理现象。这些，都是当前发展工商业的困难。要想打破这些困难，必须继续贯澈政策！首先是贯彻劳资两利政策。一方面，认真教育干部，打通干部思想，明确认识劳资两利政策在新民主主义经济制度下的重要意义，使政策贯彻到群众中去；一方面，工人要迅速健全各行业工会，产业界要组织同业公会。以这两个组织为基础，共同订立本行的集体合同，使劳资双方有共同约定的标准，消除争议，顺利进行生产。这次人民代表会议认真讨论“劳资纠纷处理办法草案”，对于解决今后劳资纠纷将有重大帮助。其次，要贯彻公私兼顾政策。过去市食粮公司与私营粉厂组织面麦购销委员会，统一收购小麦，协议面粉价格；纱布公司给染织厂配纱收布；政府协助粮商解决运输与购买手续的困难，使其购来大批粮食，并把工业品推销出去；工商局协助火柴、电木、颜料、橡胶四个行业，试办以集体订合同和集体采购方式，向国内外采购原料等，这都是比较有组织有计划的解决购销问题，今后应该把这些作法推广到各个行业。同时，贯彻公私兼顾政策最重要的一环，政府必须协助私营工业有所改造。过去有的工业在本国没有原料，有的工业在本国没有市场，原料供给产品推销都要依赖外国，形成半殖民地经济。今天必须依照毛主席的指示，贯彻“自强奋斗”的方针，打破依赖帝国主义的心理，树立面向农村，面向广大人民的观念，使城市工商业能摆脱帝国主义束缚健全发展。
