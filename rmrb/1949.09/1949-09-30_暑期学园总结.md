　　Summer School Summary
　　China New Democratic Youth League Beijing Preparatory Committee

　　(1) The Beijing Preparatory Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League and the Beijing Student Union jointly organized the Summer Youth School (hereinafter referred to as the "School") to help the vast number of Beijing college and middle school students spend a pleasant and meaningful summer vacation, transform their thinking, increase their knowledge, exercise their bodies, engage in appropriate and beneficial cultural entertainment, and lay the foundation for further improvement of youth work in schools in the next semester.

　　The school was held in five districts in the city to facilitate students' participation nearby, without centralized boarding. All college and middle school students could enter the school. The minimum number of registered participants in each district was 1,719, and the maximum was 2,648. A total of 11,410 people participated in the five districts, including 1,158 League members (except for a few branch secretaries and committee members, all were newly admitted to the League in June). Ninety-seven units of schools participated. (Originally, it was planned to include students from both colleges and middle schools as targets, but in reality, mainly middle school students participated.)

　　The school's activities lasted about 40 days from July 10 to August 18. Youth lectures were held, with a total of 60 sessions in the five districts, with 600 to 700 people attending each session, and up to 1,600 people at most. More than 9,000 students participated in cultural course tutoring, covering nine subjects such as science, mathematics, physics, and chemistry, with 360 classes. The average attendance rate was 60% to 70%. Natural science research associations, chemical engineering groups, and airplane model groups were organized. Movies were screened 19 times, parties were held 13 times, half-day labor was organized 7 times, and the cultural troupe performed 5 times. Conductor classes, dance classes, and singing groups were also organized. In addition, each district had a game room and a library. At the graduation ceremony of the school, a joint new-style sports meeting was held in each district, and 881 new League members took the oath of admission.

　　In addition, the Children's Department of the Youth League Municipal Preparatory Committee organized five district "Children's Paradises," setting up reading rooms and game rooms, and a group of middle school students from the school led children's summer recreational activities.

　　(2) How to carry out ideological education. The vast number of college and middle school students in Beijing have made great progress since liberation and enthusiastically support the Communist Party and the People's Government. Due to the direct education of the Party and the promotion of the victorious situation of the revolution after liberation, and the influence of revolutionary theoretical books, newspapers, political classes, and practical participation in social activities, they have a high enthusiasm for learning. However, because most of them are from landlord, petty-bourgeois, and bourgeois families, and have been influenced by feudal, comprador, and fascist reactionary education for a long time in the past, there are still many erroneous ideas or remnants of reactionary ideas. This is mainly reflected in the fact that many students have, to varying degrees, the following ideas:

　　A. Disregarding labor and the working people, being arrogant, exaggerating the role of intellectuals, and believing that "mental labor is superior to physical labor."

　　B. Super-class viewpoints, denying class struggle or believing that class struggle can be avoided, fantasizing about class reconciliation, unable to distinguish between enemies and ourselves, and unable to distinguish between whether peasants or landlords support each other.

　　C. Narrow nationalist sentiments, lacking internationalism and new patriotism.

　　D. Extremely democratic ideas emphasizing individual freedom, neglecting collective interests, and not recognizing the necessity of organization and discipline.

　　E. Individualistic learning attitude, divorced from practical thinking methods.

　　Participating in the school also has various motivations. Most students come to genuinely seek progress and learning, but some simply want to catch up on their studies and only participate in cultural tutoring; some come for fun and excitement; some students come indifferently, seeing others come, they come too; some students hold a wait-and-see attitude, if it is good, they will come, if it is not good, they will not come; and some students, although they have joined the school, doubt whether it is the same as the Three People's Principles Youth League summer camp.

　　Based on these circumstances, the basic policy of ideological education in the school is determined as: A. The center is to solve the problem of revolutionary outlook on life, and everything revolves around this center. B. Fully promote the spirit of democratic unity, participate in learning and activities, choose freely, and League members learn together with the vast number of students, without distinction. C. Be lively, vivid, and diverse, suitable for different requirements of different objects and the characteristics of youth.

　　Several working methods and their experiences are:

　　A. Youth lectures: Try to invite responsible comrades from the Party and government and comrades with specialized training to lecture. The entire lecture program should roughly have a system, including the basic knowledge of historical materialism (labor creates the world, the history of social development); the relationship between the individual and the collective; the introduction of the Youth League; the Sino-Soviet issue and the life of the Soviet people; revolutionary stories (the story of the 25,000-li Long March, the story of Mao Zedong, the public enemy of the people Chiang Kai-shek, the story of the peasants turning over), etc., but each lecture is an independent topic. Taking into account the students' understanding and acceptance, pay attention to being lively and vivid and storytelling, focusing on specific facts and materials, combined with theoretical analysis. The result was very effective and was universally welcomed. The aforementioned problems existing in the minds of students who participated in the lectures were initially resolved, deepening the masses' understanding of the Communist Party and strengthening the relationship between the masses and the Communist Youth League.

　　B. Performances of progressive movies and dramas: The role of ideological education is very important. The school screened Soviet films such as "Confucius," "Marette," and "Sports Conference," allowing students to see the life of the Soviet people, see the prospects of socialist construction, and inspire new patriotic spirit. Dramas such as "Earning Merit," "Conspiracy," and "Liu Hulan" were performed, deepening the students' understanding of land reform and enlightening the students' class consciousness.

　　C. Engaging in labor practice: After talking about "labor creates the world," a half-day labor was held, which greatly changed the intellectuals' disregard for labor. After the end of the school, participation in labor formed a widespread upsurge (such as when calling for participation in opening up Tiananmen Square, the number of applicants reached 18,000 in one day).

　　D. Visiting factories and having parties with workers and the People's Liberation Army are also effective practical education.

　　E. The role of group discussions: School group life should not be too strict, but a combination of learning and discussion and collective games. The groups basically rely on the original organizations of each school and are not reorganized separately. The content of the discussion should closely combine the content of the lectures with the actual problems in work and life, and appropriate criticism and self-criticism can be carried out. You can also chat in group meetings, and you can carry out collective activities such as collective games, singing and dancing. The time should not be prolonged, and the problems should not be too broad. Such group life can fully promote the students' enthusiasm and creativity, and promote unity, mutual assistance and friendship. The school's activities can also be lively and vivid.

　　This kind of ideological education method that allows free choice, free participation, is lively and diverse, and combines theory and practical life is suitable for the requirements of the vast number of students in the summer. This is a big difference in ideological education methods between the school and other cadre schools that transform intellectuals.

　　(3) Cultural course tutoring has proven to be needed by the vast number of students, and has played a practical role in helping students make up lessons and uniting them to participate in and approach the school. Individual classes where teachers taught well continued to offer classes for a period after the end of the school at the request of the students. Cultural tutoring also promoted some teachers to get closer to students and study and improve teaching methods. However, because the point that cultural course tutoring must be combined with ideological education was not emphasized enough at the beginning, and there were no restrictions on registration, some people seemed to get the impression that the school was mainly cultural tutoring, so that too many people initially registered for cultural course tutoring, and we were in a passive position. Facts have proved that although cultural course tutoring should be held in the summer youth study work in newly liberated cities, it should only be secondary and auxiliary, and should be closely coordinated with youth lectures and recreational sports activities in order to play its due role.

　　(4) Recreational sports activities are one of the very important activities of the school. The content of the activities can establish a center every week, such as sports competitions in the first week, drama performances in the second week, etc., and hold district-wide or city-wide centralized activities on a certain day of each week to drive decentralized small-scale activities by each school. The school was not active enough at the beginning due to funding constraints and lack of experience in organizing work, but the sports meeting at the end of the graduation ceremony was relatively successful, with city-wide "democratic youth gymnastics," "five-star running," tug-of-war, singing competitions, and paper glider performances. Various competitions between districts fully demonstrated the collective spirit and mass character. There is no opposition to individual competition, but this time it was limited to collective performances due to time constraints. For example, using a relay race combined with showing the various stages of the development and growth of the People's Liberation Army is a vivid way of education. These creative experiments are worth continuing to promote.

　　暑期学园总结
    中国新民主主义青年团北京市筹委会
    （一）中国新民主主义青年团北京市筹委会和北京市学生联合会，联合举办暑期青年学园（以下简称“学园”），是帮助广大的北京大中学生愉快而有意义地度过暑假，改造思想，增进知识，锻炼身体，进行适当有益身心的文化娱乐，并使下学期学校青年工作获得提高一步的基础。
    学园在城内分五个区举办，以便利同学就近参加，不集中食宿，凡大中学学生均可入园。各区报名参加的最少是一七一九人，最多是二六四八人，五个区共有一一四一○人，其中团员为一一五八人（除了少数支书支委，都是在六月份新入团的）。参加的学校有九十七个单位。（最初拟把大中学校学生都作为对象，后来实际主要只是中学生参加。）
    学园的活动自七月十日至八月十八日共约四十天，举办青年讲座，五个区共举行了六十次，每次听讲的有六七百人到最多的一千六百人。文化课程补习，参加的同学共有九千余人，分数理化等九种课程，三百六十班，上课人数平均是百分之六十到七十。组织了自然科学研究会，化工小组，飞机模型小组，放映电影十九次，联欢晚会十三次，半日劳动七次，文工团演出五次。组织了指挥班，舞蹈班，歌咏团等。另外每区设有游艺室、图书室。学园结业式时举行了各区学园联合的新型的运动会，并有八百八十一个新团员举行入团宣誓。
    此外，青年团市筹委会少年儿童部举办了五个区“儿童乐园”，设立阅览室，游艺室，由一批学园的中学的同学领导儿童暑期文娱活动。
    （二）怎样进行思想教育。北京广大的大中学校学生，解放后有很大进步，热烈拥护共产党和人民政府。由于解放后受到党的直接教育及革命胜利形势的推动，并受到革命理论书、报纸、政治课及实际参加社会活动的影响，有很高的学习热情。但因为多数都是地主、小资产阶级、资产阶级家庭出身，同时过去又长时期受着封建、买办、法西斯的反动教育的影响，因此还存在着很多错误的思想，或残留了一些反动思想的影响，这主要表现在许多同学或多或少有着下列各种思想：
    甲、轻视劳动及劳动人民，自高自大，夸大知识分子的作用，认为“脑力劳动比体力劳动高超”。
    乙、超阶级观点，否认阶级斗争或以为阶级斗争可以避免，幻想阶级调和，分不清敌我是非，分不清农民与地主谁养活谁。
    丙、狭隘的民族主义情绪，缺乏国际主义与新爱国主义的思想。
    丁、强调个人自由的极端民主化思想，忽视集体利益，不承认组织与纪律的必要。
    戊、个人主义的学习态度，脱离实际的思想方法。
    参加学园也是怀着各种不同的动机，多数同学是真正为了求进步和学习而来的，但有的人单纯为了赶功课，只参加文化补习；有一些是为了好玩，热闹热闹；有些同学是无所谓而来，看别人来自己也来了；有一些同学抱观望态度，若是好就来，不好就不来；另有一些同学虽然参加了学园，但怀疑是否和三青团夏令营一样。
    根据了这些情况，学园进行思想教育的基本方针决定为：甲、中心是解决革命人生观问题，一切围绕这一中心来进行。乙、充分发扬民主团结的精神，参加学习及活动，都自由选择，青年团员与广大同学一起学习，不分界限。丙、生动活泼与多种多样，适合不同对象的不同要求及青年化的特点。
    几种工作方式及其体验是：
    甲、青年讲座：尽量请党政负责同志及有专门修养的同志讲授，全部的讲演程序大致上应有一个系统，包括了唯物史观的基本知识（劳动创造世界，社会发展史）；个人与集体的关系；青年团的介绍；中苏问题及苏联人民生活；革命故事（两万五千里长征故事，毛泽东的故事，人民公敌蒋介石，农民翻身的故事）等，但每次讲演又是独立的一个题目。照顾同学理解力和接受程度，注意生动活泼和故事化，以具体事实材料为主，结合理论分析。结果收效很大，得到普遍的欢迎，参加听讲的同学，思想中存在的前述的各项问题，初步地得到了解决，加深了群众对共产党的认识，密切了群众对共产党青年团的关系。
    乙、进步电影戏剧的演出：思想教育的作用很大。学园演出了“万世师表”、“马丽特传”、“体育大会”等苏联电影，使同学看到苏联人民的生活，看见了社会主义建设的远景，鼓舞起新的爱国精神，戏剧演出了“立功”，“阴谋”，“刘胡兰”等，加深了同学对于土地改革的认识，启发同学们的阶级觉悟。
    丙、从事劳动的实践：讲完“劳动创造世界”后，举办了半日劳动，大大改变了知识分子对劳动的轻视。学园结束后，参加劳动形成普遍热潮（如号召参加开辟天安门广场时，报名者一天内即达一万八千人）。
    丁、参观工厂，和工人解放军联欢，也是有效的实际教育。
    戊、小组讨论的作用：学园小组生活不能太严格，而是学习讨论与集体游戏的结合。小组基本上倚靠各校原有的组织，不另行打乱重编。讨论内容要把讲座内容和工作生活中的实际问题紧密的结合起来，并可进行适当的批评与自我批评，小组会中也可以聊天，可以进行集体游戏、唱歌与练舞等集体活动。时间不可拖长，问题不可扯得太大。这样的小组生活，可以充分的发扬同学们的积极性和创造性，发扬团结互助友爱。学园的活动也就能生动活泼。
    这种容许自由选择自由参加的、生动而多种多样的、理论和生活实际结合的思想教育方式，是适合于暑期广大学生群众的要求的，这就是学园和其他改造知识分子的干部学校在思想教育方式上有着很大的不同的地方。
    （三）文化课程补习证明是广大同学所需要的，起了实际帮助同学补课和团结他们参加与接近学园的作用。教员讲得好的个别的班次，直到学园结束后，仍应同学请求继续上课一个时期。文化补习中并推动了一些教师更接近同学并研究改进教学法。但由于最初对文化课程补习必须结合思想教育这一点强调得不够，而且报名不加限制，给一些群众的印象似乎学园主要是文化补习，以致最初报名文化课程补习者过多，我们陷于被动。事实证明：在新解放城市暑期青年学习工作中文化课程补习虽应该举办，但只应是次要的和辅助性的，而且应该与青年讲座、康乐体育活动密切配合起来，才能起应有的作用。
    （四）康乐体育活动是学园的很重要的活动内容之一。活动内容可每周确立一个中心，如第一周为体育比赛，第二周为戏剧表演等，并以每周的某一天举行全区性或全市性的集中活动，以带动各校为单位的分散的小型活动。学园由于经费限制及组织工作无经验，最初不够活跃，最后结业式的体育会则是比较成功的，有全市的“民主青年集体操”，“五星赛跑”，拔河，歌咏比赛，纸滑翔机表演。各种区与区间的比赛，充分表现了集体精神与群众性，不反对有个人竞技，但此次限于时间仅有集体表演。又如用接力赛结合表现人民解放军发展壮大的各阶段，是生动的教育方式。这些有创造性的试验是值得继续发扬的。
    （未完）
