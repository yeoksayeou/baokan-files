　　The Bethune Medical School During the War of Resistance Against Japan
    Zhang Wenqi
  　Learning in Combat, Learning for Combat

    The Jin-Cha-Ji Bethune Medical School was established on September 18, 1939, in memory of the great international friend, Comrade Bethune. Its predecessor was the Jin-Cha-Ji Health School, a cadre school under the leadership of the Jin-Cha-Ji Military Region, built in the rural areas surrounded by mountains. Shortly after its establishment, it was thrown into battle due to the invasion of the Japanese寇. It experienced the Japanese 寇’s “Autumn Great Mopping-up” in 1940 and 1941, and the horrific and crazy attack in 1943, but it was not destroyed because of this. On the contrary, it grew and strengthened in the combat environment.

    In a war environment, the school's task was to "maintain safety and persist in education." However, the school was neither a combat unit nor had armed cover. In order to maintain safety, it adopted the method of dealing with the enemy—I go when the enemy comes, and I come when the enemy leaves. It was difficult to persist in education in such a turbulent situation. On the one hand, the school did indeed scout out the enemy's situation and set up sentry posts on the roads that must be passed; on the other hand, it arranged its belongings and prepared to depart urgently at any time, and then concentrated in a village edge easy to hide to have classes. Once, the school lived in a village only twelve miles away from the enemy, and we still had a week of classes as usual. Another time, we were having classes on the edge of a village when the enemy moved out only a few miles away from the village, and the sound of machine guns could be heard clearly. Based on reliable information, we judged the direction of the enemy's actions and still insisted on carrying out education without being moved. Before each march and transfer, the teachers would prepare discussion topics, and after arriving at the station and taking a short rest, the students would open their books to review and discuss. During the march, the students in charge of setting up camp would also write some drug names in chalk in obvious places along the way, ask some questions or write a few short poems to help students think and memorize. In short, in the tense battle, various methods were adopted to seize the time to study. In this way, four classes of students completed their study tasks and graduated.

    The graduating students all "resolutely obeyed the organization's assignments without haggling at all" and happily went to their work posts. Most of them went to the front lines to serve, and they were proud of it.

    Never Bow to Difficulties

    Because the enemy implemented a blockade policy, it was impossible to purchase specimens, instruments, models, and wall charts from the outside; the source of teachers was even more lacking; there were no desks and chairs in the classroom, only an empty house, especially when the enemy was "mopping up," the marching must be light, and the tools used by the students for practice could not be carried for a while, which further increased the difficulty of practice, but we "never bowed to difficulties."

    In 1940, when the enemy "mopped up," the school transferred, and the students practiced without instruments or sickrooms. So, they used razors instead of scalpels, earth scissors instead of surgical scissors, sewing needles instead of suture needles, sewing thread instead of suture thread, and used dogs and sheep to do various experiments. We didn't have wall charts, so we drew more than 600 pictures ourselves. Without specimens, models, and instruments, we imitated them ourselves, and made more than 100 mud models alone. Without desks and chairs, we built stone tables and stone benches with stones ourselves. Without firewood, we cut it ourselves, and there was no problem with heating the kang, washing our faces, and keeping warm. Teachers were lacking, so we trained them ourselves. An education cadre, who originally studied education, took time to listen to lectures and practice, and later he was not only able to see patients, but also able to teach. We also mobilized teachers to listen to each other's lectures and learn from each other. Those who could teach one course could teach two or three later. In the autumn of 1943, during the "mopping up," under the enemy's "three-light policy," almost all of the school's houses were burned down, and there was not even a place to live. All the teachers and students worked together, carrying mud and carrying water, and in less than a month, the ruined walls were turned into brand-new buildings again. "The Japanese devils burned the house, but they can't burn our hearts!" This was the unanimous conclusion.

    The School is a Big Family

    The relationship between teachers and students is twofold: on the one hand, they are teachers and students, and on the other hand, they are comrades; they respect each other in work and are politically equal; the classroom is serious and the extracurricular activities are lively. Outside of class, you can see teachers and students rehearsing plays, singing, and playing ball together, and you can also see old teachers and female students running side by side; when students or teachers are sick, they take good care of each other. During the New Year, the students organized a Yangko team to pay New Year's greetings to the teachers. During study time, they are very serious. During class, the classroom with dozens of people is silent, and the teacher will strictly criticize anyone who does not study hard. If the teacher does not teach well, the students will also frankly express their opinions. Teachers and students all believe that not criticizing is irresponsible, so they are happy to accept criticism and also happy to express their opinions. Among the students, they take care of each other's lives. Those who have shoes are willing to let those who have no shoes wear them, and those who are not sick help those who are sick to fetch water and food. During the march, the strong help the weak to carry backpacks and carry things. When participating in labor, the strong do heavy work and the weak do light work. There is no gap between teachers, students, and classmates, but it is not a harmonious atmosphere. It is a principled intimacy and unity. The school is like a big family.

    Teaching Democracy and Mutual Assistance

    The school especially emphasized teaching mutual assistance—teachers tutoring students, students helping teachers, and students helping students. Many mutual aid groups were organized among the students, and those who studied well helped those who studied poorly. Every day after class, the group held a study discussion meeting to deeply discuss the courses of many days. If they encountered difficulties that could not be solved, they would submit them to the teachers for answers. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, people from outside the border area who visited the school praised it as the best method of collective mutual assistance. Teachers are not only responsible to the students in the classroom, but also care about the students' studies outside of class, and pay special attention to the students' extracurricular tutoring.

    In teaching, a high degree of democratic style was brought into play. When students have problems, they can fully express their opinions, and different opinions can be freely debated. Students can also criticize the shortcomings in teaching. Teachers often solicit students' opinions to correct their shortcomings.

    Focus on Key Education

    The war required a large number of doctors to serve the wounded and sick, which determined that the school must meet this war requirement and must train a large number of talents in a short period of time. The school first decided that the study period would be one year. At first, some people doubted: How can a doctor be trained in one year? But the facts proved that the students who graduated after one year of study could be doctors, which is the result of the school's implementation of key education.

    The characteristics of key education are: what is not practical is not taught; what is practical but cannot be done locally at present is taught less. For example, during the war, surgery was the main focus, and war injuries were the main focus of surgery, and limb injuries were the main focus of war injuries. Other injuries, such as head injuries, were relatively rare at the time, so they were briefly explained. Although the lectures focused on war injuries, it was not that non-war surgery was not studied at all, but that some common diseases such as appendicitis, hemorrhoids, and hernias were all listed as mandatory. The same is true for other subjects, which are selectively studied. There are also different levels of importance in the content of a disease. For example, there are various theories about the cause of the disease. Select the most reliable or relatively reliable one as the focus. The same is true for the treatment methods. The most suitable one that can be done locally is taught, and the rest is briefly explained.

    We advocate that basic courses should be combined with clinical courses. For example, anatomy has the most relationship with surgery, so it is listed as the main course of basic courses. Limb injuries are the most common in war injuries, so when explaining anatomy, the focus is on the limbs. The same is true for other subjects.

    Clinical practice and basic course practice are based on the content of the lectures. What is taught is practiced. The operations that may be used in the work must be practiced repeatedly to ensure that they can be done in the work. Such as hemostasis, expansion, fracture treatment, various injections, trachoma surgery, etc.

    The school implemented key education, which not only shortened the entire education time, but also enabled the trained doctors to truly be able to take on tasks when they arrived in practical work. This is why doctors can be trained in a short period of time.

    Most of the doctors in the Jin-Cha-Ji area during the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan were trained in this way, and the work results were very good, so they were welcomed, which also shows the success of key education. However, the school's implementation of key education was also guaranteed by fighting against various incorrect ideas.

    For example, some dogmatic teachers believe that the teaching materials are streamlined and the content is too little, and it does not look like teaching a book; we pointed out that this is an idea that only focuses on form and not substance. Some people think that too little is taught, and the students will not understand anything and will have difficulties in their work; we proposed that this violates the spirit of seeking truth from facts, because in a short period of time, it is impossible to learn everything well in order to train a large number of doctors to complete the requirements of the war. In addition, teachers were also organized to visit the front lines and various hospitals to recognize reality from actual observations and compare their own teaching work, what was successful, and what was a failure, as experience and lessons. After such practical observation and research, the teachers further improved their teaching. Therefore, the school's key education was implemented.

    Striving for Production and Construction

    The Bethune Medical School grew and strengthened in the battle. It is a melting pot that has trained thousands of excellent medical workers to fight bravely and tenaciously against the enemy in the Liberation War. Under the leadership of the Party, they learned political and medical theories, mastered these weapons, and worked diligently and hard to serve the wounded and sick and the broad masses of the people in every work post. Many of them have won the glorious title of combat hero and model worker, and many have also heroically sacrificed in the struggle against the enemy. Their heroic names will be passed down through the ages.

    In July 1948, the school merged with the Medical College of North China University and was renamed the North China Medical University. Its strength was further strengthened, and there were many new creations in teaching and learning methods. It had 1,500 students, and 800 students could graduate every year and be assigned to the front lines, the rear, cities, and villages to take on part of the task of health construction. On the eve of the complete victory of the national revolution, to review the difficult creation process of this school is of certain significance to the future national medical education construction, to the transformation of medical education from a war environment to a peaceful environment, and from serving the military to serving production and construction.

　　抗战中的白求恩医科学校
    张文奇
  　在战斗中学习，学习为了战斗
    晋察冀白求恩医科学校，诞生于一九三九年九月十八日，是为了纪念伟大的国际友人白求恩同志而成立的。他的前身是晋察冀卫生学校，是晋察冀军区领导之下的一个干部学校，建设于群山环绕的农村。成立不久，便因日寇的进扰而投入战斗。它经过了日寇一九四○、四一年“秋季大扫荡”及四三年惨绝人寰的疯狂进攻，但是它并未因此而受摧残，相反的，它却在战斗的环境中成长和壮大起来了。
    在战争环境中，学校的任务是“保持安全，坚持教育”。但学校既非战斗部队，又没有武装掩护，为了保持安全，就采取了和敌人周旋的办法——敌来我去，敌去我来。在这样动荡的情况下，坚持教育是困难的。学校一方面确实侦察敌情，在往来必经之路，设好监视哨；一方面把自己东西安排好，准备随时紧急出发，然后集中于村边易于荫蔽之处上课。有一次学校住在一个村庄，离敌人只有十二里路，而我们照常上了一周的课。另一次，正在一个村边上课，敌人出动距这村只有几里路，机枪声历历可闻，我们根据可靠情报，判断敌人行动的方向，仍坚持进行了教育，未被所动。在每次行军转移前，教员便出好讨论题，到达驻地，略事休息后，同学便翻开书本，进行复习与讨论。行军途中，担任设营的同学，也在沿途明显之处，用粉笔写些药名，出些问题或编几句短诗，帮助同学思考与记忆。总之，在紧张的战斗中，采取各种方法，抓紧学习。就这样四个班的同学完成了学习任务而毕业。
    毕业同学都“坚决服从组织分配，丝毫不讲价钱”，愉快的走到工作岗位上。他们大部分到前线去服务，并以为光荣。
    决不向困难低头
    因为敌人实行封锁政策，从外面购不到标本、仪器、模型、挂图；师资来源，更是缺乏；课堂没有桌凳，只是一间空屋子，尤其在敌人“扫荡”时，行军必需轻装，学生实习用的工具，一时不能携带，更增加了实习困难，但是我们“决不向困难低头”。
    一九四○年敌人“大扫荡”，学校转移，学生实习，既无器械，又无病室，于是用剃头刀代替手术刀，用土剪刀代替手术剪，用缝衣针代替缝合针，用缝衣线代替缝合线，用狗、羊做各种实验。我们没有挂图，便自己画了六百余幅。没有标本、模型、仪器，自己去仿制，仅泥制模型便作了百余件。没有桌凳，自己用石头砌为石桌、石凳，没有柴烧，自己去割，烧炕、洗脸、取暖不成问题了。教员缺乏，自己培养，一位教育干事，最初是学教育的，他抽暇听课实习，后来不仅能看病，还能够教书。我们还发动教员互相听讲，互相学习，原来能教一种课的，后来能教两种三种了。一九四三年秋季“扫荡”，在敌人的“三光政策”下，学校的房子几乎大部烧光，连住处都没有，全校师生一齐动手，挑泥担水，不到一月，把颓垣断壁又变成了崭新的建筑。“日本鬼子烧了房，烧不了我们的心！”这是众口一声的结论。
    学校是个大家庭
    师生的关系是两重的：一方面是师生，一方面又是同志；工作上互相尊重，政治上互相平等；课内是严肃的，课外是活泼的。课外可以看到教员和学生一同排剧、唱歌、打球，也可以看到年老的教员和女同学并肩赛跑；同学或教员有病时，彼此都十分照顾。新年时，同学组织秧歌队给教员拜年。在学习时间，则非常认真。上课时，几十人的教室，鸦雀无声，谁不好好学习，教员是要严格批评的。教员教不好课，同学亦直爽的提出意见，师生均认为若不批评便是不负责，因此乐于接受批评，也乐于提出意见。同学之间，生活互相照顾，有鞋的情愿给无鞋的同学穿，无病的帮助有病的打水、打饭，行军中，体壮的帮助体弱的背背包、带东西，参加劳动时，体强的作重活，体弱的作轻活。师生同学之间，不存在任何隔膜，但不是一团和气，是有原则的亲密和团结，学校就好似一个大家庭。
    教学民主与互助
    学校特别强调教学互助——教员辅导学生，学生帮助教员，同学帮助同学。在同学中组织了许多互助小组，学习好的与差的进行互助。每天课后小组开学习讨论会，把多天的课程，深入的进行讨论。如遇疑难解决不了，再提交教员解答。抗战期间，边区外界人士，到学校参观，都称赞这是一个集体互助的最好方法。教员不仅在课堂对同学负责，在课外也关心同学学习，特别注意对同学的课外辅导。
    在教学上高度的发挥了民主作风，学生有问题时，能够充分发表自己意见，不同意见可以自由争论。学生对教学上的缺点，同样可以提出批评，教员经常征求同学意见，以改正自己缺点。
    重点教育
    战争需要大批医生为伤病员服务，这样就决定了学校必须满足这项战争要求，必须在短时期内培养大批人材的任务。学校首先决定学习期为一年。开始有人怀疑：一年怎能培养出医生来？但事实证明，学习一年毕业的同学，是能当医生的，这就是学校实行了重点教育的结果。
    重点教育的特点是：不实用的不讲；实用而目前当地办不到的少讲。例如战争时期以外科为主，外科之中又以战伤为主，战伤之中又以四肢为主，其他如头部战伤当时比较少见，因此就略讲一点。讲课虽以战伤为主，并不是非战伤外科一点也不学，而是选择常见的一些病如盲肠炎、痔漏、疝气等，皆作为必讲之列。同样道理，其他各科也是有选择的进行学习。讲一个病内容方面也有轻重之分，例如这个病的原因，有种种学说，选择其中最可靠的或比较可靠的作为重点。讲到疗法也是如此，把其中最适用而当地又能作到的去讲，其余的是略加讲解而已。
    我们主张基础课配合临床课，例如解剖学和外科的关系最多，因而把它列为基础课的主要课目，战伤中以四肢为最多，于是讲解剖时，以四肢为重点。其他各科目都是与此大同小异。
    临床实习和基础课的实习，是以授课内容为基础，讲什么就实习什么。在工作中可能用到的操作，必须要反复的实习，保证在工作中能够会作。例如止血法、扩创术、骨折的处置、各种注射、砂眼手术等。
    学校实行了重点教育，不仅整个教育时间缩短了，而且培养的医生，到达实际工作中，真正能够担负起任务，这就是为什么时间短，也能训练出医生来的原因。
    抗战八年晋察冀区域内的医生，大部分是这样培养出来的，工作成绩是很好的，因此受到欢迎，这也说明重点教育的成功。但学校实行重点教育，也是经过与各种不正确思想斗争，才保证实现的。
    如有教条主义的教员则认为教材精简了，内容太少，不象讲一部书；我们提出这是只重形式不重实质的思想。有的认为讲的太少，学生什么也不懂，工作中会有困难；我们提出这是违背了实事求是精神，因为在短期内培养大批医生完成战争的要求，不可能一切都学得好。另外，还组织教员到前线、到各个医院去参观，从实际的观察中去认识现实，对照自己的教学工作，那些成功，那些失败，作为经验教训。经过这样实际的观察、研究，教员更改善了自己的教学。因而学校的重点教育，得以贯彻执行。
    为生产建设而奋斗
    白求恩医科学校是在战斗中生长和壮大的，她是一座熔炉，锻炼成数以千计的优秀医务工作者，为解放战争勇敢顽强的向敌人搏斗。他们在党的领导下，学习了政治的、医学的理论，掌握了这些武器，在每一个工作岗位，辛勤刻苦的为伤病员及广大人民服务，曾有不少获得了战斗英雄模范工作者的光荣称号，也有不少在对敌斗争中，英勇牺牲了，他们的英名，将流芳万世。
    一九四八年七月，学校和华北大学医学院合并，改称华北医科大学，力量更加壮大，教学与学习方法更有不少新的创造，它拥有学生一千五百人，每年可有八百个同学毕业，分发到前线、后方、城市、农村，担负起一部分卫生建设的任务。在全国革命彻底胜利的前夕，来检讨一下这个学校艰难缔造的过程，对今后的全国医学教育建设事业上，对医学教育由战争环境转为和平环境，由为军事服务转成为生产建设服务，是有一定意义的。
