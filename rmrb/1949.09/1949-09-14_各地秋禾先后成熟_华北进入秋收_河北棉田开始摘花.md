Autumn Crops Mature Successively Across Regions
　 North China Enters Autumn Harvest
　 Cotton Picking Begins in Hebei, Hebei Province

　　[This newspaper report] Autumn crops are maturing successively in various parts of North China, and the autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and wheat planting work have gradually entered a tense stage. Zhangbei and other places in Chahar Province began the autumn harvest in late August. In order to avoid wind and hail disasters, men, women, and children all worked together. Currently, in the four districts of Ertai, Gonghui, and Mantouying in the county, harvesting has reached half of all crops. The other districts have harvested at least 30% or more. In general, wheat, peas, and other miscellaneous fields have been completely harvested, and most of the land in Liangmianjing Village that has been harvested has also been plowed for autumn. The leaders of the Dabao District of Zhuolu conscientiously implemented the county committee's instructions of "harvesting a piece, plowing a piece," and "not losing a single grain," and restored the old work teams in each village, with village cadres leading by area and household. By the end of last month, nearly 10,000 mu of early crops such as peas and lentils had been harvested, and all the land had been plowed. To prevent wind and hail, the 46 villages in the district are now busy with the autumn harvest, and nearly 20,000 mu of land has been plowed immediately after harvesting. On the 8th of this month, the county committee issued a special bulletin praising them and calling on other districts to learn from them.

　　This year, Hebei planted more than 9 million mu of cotton. After a difficult struggle against various disasters by cadres and the masses, cotton picking has now begun in various cotton fields. Most farmers in Qinghe have entered a hot period of autumn harvesting and plowing, and many villages are delivering manure and plowing as they harvest. Due to wind and rain disasters this year, Qi County's autumn fields have reduced yield and farmers are carefully reaping and threshing, storing chaff and bran in preparation to survive the famine. The counties under the Changzhi Special District of Shanxi Province have completed the preparations for planting wheat, and some areas have already started planting wheat. At present, 50% of the wheat fields in the entire special district have been plowed twice, and some areas have completed three plows. Fertilizers have also increased significantly. In Xiangyuan, Licheng, and other places, most of the manure has been delivered, and autumn planting is now being carried out in conjunction with the autumn harvest. More than one hundred cadres in the Fengzhen First District of Suiyuan held a meeting and proposed a grand competition for autumn harvest and autumn plowing to ensure that the crops would not suffer any loss. Many middle peasants in Sichengwa, Mazhan, and other villages bought cattle to prepare for autumn plowing.

　　A large number of cadres and students have been sent to the countryside to guide farmers in field selection

　　Many regions have paid attention to seed selection during the autumn harvest. The Dazhai Village branch in Yushe promoted mass seed selection using on-site inspection and comparison methods. The Gaoyi County government, the Xingtang Promotion Station, and the Hejian County Committee in Hebei Province have all held seed selection meetings, and field selection has become a practical action for farmers in various villages. A large number of cadres and students from the North China Farm and the Agricultural College of North China University have gone to the countryside to guide farmers in field seed selection and are preparing to hold small exhibitions of excellent varieties in various villages to promote them. In Tangshan and other places, attention has been paid to the disinfection of seeds during wheat planting. The Tangshan Agricultural Experiment Station has dispatched technicians to the countryside and brought seed soaking disinfectants and other medicines to help farmers disinfect.

　　Generally speaking, more attention has been paid to autumn protection work this year's autumn harvest, especially in the new districts. In Yuanyang County (formerly Wuwu, Yangwu) in Pingyuan Province, 676 of the county's 679 villages have organized crop watching teams, with approximately 7,000 members watching more than 10,000 mu of crops. The suburban area of Shijiazhuang has organized autumn harvest joint defense teams to jointly prevent theft and special agents. Currently, the autumn harvest and plowing movement is being widely carried out in various places.
