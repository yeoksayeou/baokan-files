A Visit with General Zhao Shoushan
    Lin Hong
    "The complete liberation of the Great Northwest is only a matter of time!" With a smile on his face, General Zhao Shoushan, Deputy Commander of the First Field Army, began his conversation with the reporter with this short and powerful statement.

    General Zhao Shoushan is fifty-six years old this year. With his tall stature and rosy cheeks, he still looks very strong. He faced the reporter kindly and continued his conversation. He said: Since our army liberated Xi'an and completed the great annihilation battle against Hu Zongnan's four armies in the Fufeng and ＠ counties area of the western section of the Longhai Railway, driving the remnant Hu Zongnan bandit troops into the depths of the Qinling Mountains, our hundreds of thousands of troops have taken advantage of the victory and fiercely pursued the fleeing enemy with the force of a gale sweeping away fallen leaves, launching a powerful offensive towards Gansu. In a short period of more than 20 days of combat, we quickly liberated more than 20 counties in eastern and southern Gansu, and captured Lanzhou, the second largest city in the Northwest. From then on, the Two Ma bandit armies were divided by us. Our army is now advancing into Qinghai and Ningxia in separate columns. On the 5th of this month, we liberated Xining City, the capital of Qinghai Province. The day of the final demise of the Ma bandit army is coming soon.

    Regarding the reasons for obtaining this great victory, Deputy Commander Zhao believed that it was mainly due to the correct guidance of Chairman Mao's strategic thinking and the wise leadership of Deputy Commander Peng, the courageous fighting of all our commanders and fighters, the active support of the people of the Northwest, and the effective coordination of neighboring regions. He recalled the development of the Northwest war situation over the past two years and more, saying:

    When the Hu Zongnan bandit gang launched a full-scale offensive against our Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Liberated Area in March 1947, our army's total strength was only more than 21,000 people, while the enemy had more than 320,000, a ratio of about fifteen to one. The enemy's equipment was also much better than ours. These were the "elite troops" that the Hu bandits had never used to fight against Japan during the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, but had specially used to deal with us. Under such a disparity in strength between the enemy and ourselves, Hu Zongnan was confident that he could completely eliminate our army, but his arrogant attempt was quickly shattered by the hammer of our army. Our army resisted Hu's absolutely superior forces with such inferior forces, and further defeated the enemy, strengthened ourselves, and achieved such a great victory today. This is by no means an accidental event. It fully proves that the liberation war we are waging today is supported by the broad masses of the people.

    In the early days of Hu's offensive against us, Chairman Mao was still in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia border area. He was very calm and composed, and had a firm belief in the future of the war. He was with the soldiers, often maneuvering with the crazy enemy at a distance of ten or eight miles. The entire army was inspired by his great spirit, and morale was very high. Everyone fought hard against the enemy under the slogan of protecting Chairman Mao, protecting the people of the Northwest, and eliminating the Hu bandit army. On the second day of entering Yan'an, Hu Zongnan sent seven more brigades of troops to march wildly along the high mountains and forests of northern Shaanxi to Ansai, Panlong, Yongping, Qingjian... everywhere they found nothing. While he was wandering aimlessly all over the mountains and fields, we annihilated his 31st Brigade Headquarters and 92nd Regiment in Qinghuabian, and Brigade Commander Li Ji＠ became the first captured general. Then we annihilated more than 4,700 people in Yangmahe, capturing Brigade Commander Mai Zongyu alive; in the Panlong battle, Li Kungang, the brigade commander of the 167th Brigade, one of Hu's four diamond generals, was also captured, and Hu's prestige suffered a serious blow. In August 1947, Hu attempted to open up the Xianyu Highway and complete the plan to occupy all of northern Shaanxi, but in the Battle of Shajiadian, his 36th Division's 123rd Brigade was annihilated, and Brigade Commander Liu Ziqi was captured. Immediately following was the Battle of Qingjian in October, where the 76th Division was again annihilated, and Division Commander Liao Ang and others were captured alive, forcing the Jiang-Hu bandit army to quickly flee from Suide. The delusion of completely occupying northern Shaanxi, which the Kuomintang Central News Agency had been publicizing for a long time, was completely bankrupt, and our army turned to external operations, creating the great victories of Hancheng and Yichuan. These two blind bears of Hu Zongnan were beaten so badly that they did not dare to run around again.

    In the spring of 1948, after winter training, our army began to advance by leaps and bounds into the Kuomintang-occupied areas. First, we besieged Yichuan, annihilating more than 30,000 men of Hu's ace 29th Army, killing his generals Liu Kan and Yan Ming, and liberating Yichuan City. Because this battle annihilated Hu's mobile forces, a significant change occurred in the strength of the enemy and ourselves. Then we recovered Fuxian and Ganquan, making the bandit troops occupying Yan'an even more isolated; when our army approached Luochuan and went straight to the Xifu Linyou area, Hu's rear was very empty, and our army entered as if into an unpopulated area, quickly liberating Baoji. The enemies in Yan'an and Luochuan quickly tucked their tails and fled. The fate of the complete failure of the Jiang-Hu bandit gang in northern Shaanxi was completely doomed with the recovery of Yan'an. Our vast army and people in the Northwest finally reversed the war situation through arduous battles. From then on, our army turned to a stage of full-scale offensive against the enemy. Up to now, our army has defeated nearly 300,000 Hu and Ma bandit troops, recovered and liberated large areas of the Northwest, including Xi'an and Lanzhou. We are now advancing into Qinghai and Ningxia, directly attacking the Ma bandit's lair. The day of complete liberation of the Great Northwest is coming soon!

    General Zhao Shoushan paused slightly, then said: The disasters inflicted on the people of the Northwest by the Hu and Ma bandit gangs are very deep. In the Ma bandit army, if a soldier deserted, his whole family would be detained or killed; if a soldier died, his older or younger brother would have to fill his vacancy; a Bao [group of families] had to produce more than 20 strong laborers, and a strong laborer had to be bought with 20 shi [unit of dry measure] of wheat. Under such extremely barbaric rule, the people of the Northwest were suffering unspeakably. It was common for children in their teens west of Lanzhou to be so poor that they had no pants to wear. The days of reckoning for the Hu and Ma bandit gangs and the people of the Northwest are coming soon!

    The reporter then asked General Zhao what the masses thought of our army during our army's great advance into the Northwest. He said: Our army was warmly welcomed by the broad masses of the people in the Northwest everywhere. Many villagers were eager to tell our army about the atrocities of the Hu and Ma bandit troops. They said in unison: "If you (referring to the People's Liberation Army) had come later, we would have been finished." Once, our army took a short rest in a certain place in the evening while attacking the enemy. The local people, knowing that our army was about to arrive, boiled water at night and sent it to our army. When the boatmen of the Wei River fled, they sank the boats to the bottom of the river. When we arrived, they quickly salvaged them and ferried us across. Especially the railway workers on the Longhai Railway showed great class love to our army. When the enemy was about to flee, they dismantled the locomotives and pretended that the cars were broken when the bandit troops came to ask for them. But after we arrived, they quickly reassembled the locomotives and let our army board them and drive west to pursue the enemy. When the Hu bandit army tied explosives to the machines in the Caijiapo and Guozhen factory areas to destroy them, the workers hugged the machines and prevented them from being blown up. At this time, our army chased after them, drove away the bandit troops, and rescued the workers. In the countryside, the broad masses of peasants automatically donated grain and participated in the war. Especially during our advance into Gansu, we showed great respect for the customs and habits of the Hui people, so the broad masses of Hui people loved our army very much, completely exposing the Ma bandit's rumors that our army would "exterminate the clan and destroy religion."

    When the reporter asked about the morale of our army, General Zhao Shoushan replied with "an indescribable spirit of self-sacrifice and active creativity," and immediately cited many moving heroic deeds. For example, a soldier in a certain unit, in order to destroy a bunker that was obstructing the advance, tied grenades all over his body, rolled under the bunker, and then pulled the fuse, perishing together with the bunker; in the Libei battle, a soldier in a certain unit named Gao Jiakai also gloriously completed the task of blowing up the enemy's outer moat in the same way. General Zhao Shoushan said: If our soldiers do not complete the tasks given to them by their superiors, they will consider it a great shame, and in the end they will think of various ways to complete the task before they feel happy. Then he analyzed the reasons for the high morale of our army, saying that this is because there is a fully democratic style in the army, and issues such as combat plans, combat techniques, and life management must be discussed democratically by the soldiers and put forward opinions. Soldiers can evaluate cadres; democratic evaluation is also used for party members. Because of these many measures, soldiers can fully exert their creativity. For example, in the past year, our army has made three or forty new creations in combat techniques and other aspects. High morale is one of the important factors that enable our army to overcome difficult environments and defeat the enemy.

    Finally, Deputy Commander Zhao sighed and said: The disasters inflicted on the people of the Northwest by the Hu and Ma bandit gangs are very profound: In the Ma bandit army, if a soldier deserted, his whole family would be detained or killed; if a soldier died, his older or younger brother would have to fill his vacancy; a Bao [group of families] had to produce more than 20 strong laborers, and a strong laborer had to be bought with 20 shi [unit of dry measure] of wheat. Under such extremely barbaric rule, the people of the Northwest were suffering unspeakably. It was common for children in their teens west of Lanzhou to be so poor that they had no pants to wear. The days of reckoning for the Hu and Ma bandit gangs and the people of the Northwest are coming soon!

　　赵寿山将军访问记
    林洪
    “大西北的全部解放已只是短时间内的事了１第一野战军副司令员赵寿山将军面露微笑，用这一句简短而有力的语句，向记者开始了他的谈话。
    赵寿山将军今年已五十六岁了，高大的身躯，红润的面颊，仍然显得十分健壮。他慈祥地面对记者，继续着他的谈话。他说：自我军解放西安，并在陇海西段扶风、＠县地区完成对胡匪宗南四个军的大歼灭战，将残存的胡宗南匪部赶进了秦岭深山之后，我数十万大军便以疾风扫落叶之势乘胜向西猛追逃敌，发起了向甘肃进军的强大攻势，在短短的廿余天作战中，很快解放了陇东、陇南廿余座县城，并攻占了西北第二大城兰州，从此二马匪军便被我分割开了。我军现正分兵挺进青海、宁夏，本月五日已经解放青海省城西宁市，马匪军最后灭亡的日子，很快就要到来了。
    关于这一伟大胜利的获得的原因，赵副司令员认为主要是毛主席战略思想的正确指导和彭副总司令的英明领导，我军全体指占员奋勇的作战，西北人民的积极支援，友邻区的有效配合。他追述两年多来西北战局发展的经过说：
    当一九四七年三月胡宗南匪帮向我陕甘宁解放区发动全面攻热的时候，我军全部兵力仅为二万一千余人，敌军则拥有三十二万多人，大约是十五与一之比，敌军的装备也比我军要好得多，这是胡匪在八年抗日战争中从未用来抗战而专门对付我们的“精锐部队”。在敌我力量这样悬殊的情形下，胡宗南满以为能够全部消灭我军，但他的这一狂妄企图，在我军铁拳的锤击下，很快就宣告幻灭了。我军以如此劣热的兵力抗击了胡匪绝对优势的兵力，并进一步击溃了敌人，壮大了自己，取得今天如此伟大的胜利，这愉不是件偶然的事情，它充分证明：我们今天进行的解放战争是得到广大人民支持的。
    在胡匪向我发起攻势的初期，毛主席还在陕甘宁边区，他非常镇静、沉着，对于战局的前途有着必胜的信念。他和战士们在一起，常常与疯狂的敌人周旋于十里八里的距离中，全军受了他的伟大精神的感召，士气非常高涨，大家在保护毛主席，保护西北人民，消灭胡匪军的口号下，同敌人进行了艰苦的战斗。胡宗南在进入延安的第二天，又派出七个旅的兵力，沿着陕北高山梢林武大游行到安塞、蟠龙、永坪、清涧……到处都扑了一个空。当他正满山遍野到处瞎撞的时候，我们就在青化砭消灭了他的三十一旅旅部及九十二团，旅长李纪＠作了第一个俘虏将军。接着又在羊马河歼灭了四千七百余人，活捉旅长麦宗禹；在蟠龙战斗中，胡匪的四大金刚之一的一六七旅旅长李昆岗也被俘，胡匪的威风遭到了严重的打击。一九四七年八月，胡匪企图打通咸榆公路，完成全部占领陕北的计划，可是沙家店一战，歼灭了他的三十六师一二三旅，旅长刘子奇被俘，紧接着有十月清涧战斗，七六师又被歼，师长廖昂等被活捉，迫使蒋、胡匪军迅速从绥德逃跑，伪中央社宣传很久的全部占领陕北的妄想完全破产了，而我军则转入外线作战，造成韩城、宜川大捷，胡宗南这一双瞎狗熊被打得再也不敢乱窜了。
    一九四八年春天，经过冬季大练兵，我军开始向蒋占区大踏步前进，首先围攻宜川，消灭了胡匪的王牌第二十九军三万余人，击毙他的大将刘戡、严明，解放了宜川城。由于这一战歼灭了胡匪的机动部队，敌我兵力发生显著变化，接着又收复富县、甘泉，使得占领延安的匪军更形孤单；当我军进逼洛川，直下西府麟游地区时，胡匪后方非常空虚，我军如入无人之境，迅速解放了宝鸡，延安和洛川的敌人便赶快夹着尾巴逃了。蒋、胡匪帮在陕北整个失败的命运，随着延安的光复，已完全注定了。我西北广大军民在艰难苦战中终于扭转了战局，从此我军便转入对敌全面进攻的阶段，到今天为止，我军击溃了胡、马匪军将近三十万人，收复和解放了连西安、兰州在内的西北大片地区，现在正进军青海、宁夏，直捣马匪老巢，大西北全部解放的日子就要到来了！
    赵寿山将军略微停顿了一下，接着便说：一九四七年西北战场确是很艰苦的，一方面是蒋、胡匪军烧、杀、抢劫大量的破坏，给西北人民带来了严重的灾祸；同时又赶上陕、甘、宁、绥的大旱灾，整个上半年只下了风场小雨，许多青苗被晒死，秋收无粮。就在这样困苦的情形下，农民把自己多年积存的粮食献给部队，自已用瓜豆充饥，而部队则尽量把军粮减至每人每天不到一年，将节省下来的粮食供给无粮的群众。由于军民如此亲密的关系，我们终于战胜艰难的环境，取得了今天的胜利。当我军攻打盐池时，群众从六十里外向沙漠地的我军送水，这是多么动人的故事啊！这就是毛主席在边区教导的军爱民、民拥军的结果！
    记者接着问赵将军，在我军这次向西北大进军的途中，群众对我军的印象如何？他说：我军到处受到了西北广大人民的热烈欢迎，许多老乡都争着向我军述说胡、马匪军的暴行，他们异口同声地表示：“要是你们（指解放军晚来些时，我们便完蛋了。”有一次晚间我军进攻敌人在某地小休息，当地的老百姓知道我军将要到达，在夜里便把开水烧好，给我军送去。渭河的船工们，当敌人逃跑时，便把船沉到河底去，当我们到来时，他们便迅速地捞起来，渡我们过去。尤其是陇海路的铁路工人，对我军更表现了伟大的阶级友爱，当敌人快要逃跑时，他们把车头都拆坏了，匪军来要车时，便推说车坏了，但我们到达后，就迅速把车头装好，证我军坐上，往西开去追击敌人。蔡家坡、虢镇工厂区的工人，当胡匪军用炸药绑在机器上要破坏时，便抱住机器不让炸，就在这时候我军追到，赶走匪军，才把工人救下来。在农村里，广大农民自动献粮，自动参战，特别是我灾向甘肃进军途中，对于回民风俗习惯非常尊重，因之广大回民对我军非常热爱，完全揭破了马匪污蔑我军“灭族灭教”的谣言。
    当记者问到我军的士气时，赵寿山将军以“难以形容的自我牺牲的精神和积极的创造性”来回答，并且立刻举出许多动人的英事迹。如某部有一名战士为炸毁一座障碍前进道路的地堡，全身缚上手榴弹，滚到地堡下面，然后拉开火线，自己和地堡一块儿同归于尽；在荔北战役时，某部一个叫高家凯的战士也以同样的方式，光荣地完成了爆炸敌人外壕的任务。赵寿山将军说：我们的战士若没有完成上级给他的任务，便会认为是绝大的耻辱，最后他也要想的飞各种方法，完成伤务，才会觉得高兴的。接着他分析我军士气高涨的原因说，这是因为军队中有着充分民主的作风，作战计划，作战技术和生活管理等问题都要经过战士民主讨论，提出意见，战士可以评干部；对于党员也采用民主评论的方式。因为有这许多措施，战士都能充分发挥他的创造性，如过去一年中，我军在作战技术等方面就有三、四十种新的创造。旺盛的士气是我军能够克服困难环境，战胜敌人的重要因素之一。
    最后赵副司令员慨叹地说：胡、马匪帮加在西北人民身上的灾难是很深重的：在马匪军队里一个士兵逃跑，他的全家就要遭到扣押或杀戮；一个兵士死亡，他的哥哥弟弟就要补充他的缺额；一个保要出二十多个壮丁，而一个壮丁则要二十石麦子才能买到。在这样极端野蛮的统治下，西北人民是痛苦不堪的，兰州以西十几岁的孩子穷的没有裤子穿是很普遍的现象。胡、马匪帮与西北人民审羊他们的日子快要到来了！
