　　Ping People's Bank Savings Department
  　Increases Agency for Picking Up and Transporting Goods
    To Facilitate Material Pick-Up and Transportation and Promote Trade Between Urban and Rural Areas
    [Reported by this newspaper] In order to meet social needs, facilitate the pick-up and transportation of materials, and cooperate with the promotion of economic policies of mutual assistance between urban and rural areas and internal and external exchanges, the Savings Department of the People's Bank of Beiping Branch has specially added the business of acting as an agent for picking up and transporting goods starting from September 6. The main methods are as follows: 1. The scope of agency pick-up and transportation is divided into two types: intra-city transportation (including urban and suburban areas) and inter-city transportation. The areas where inter-city transportation is available will be announced separately by the department based on traffic conditions and transport capacity. 2. The person entrusting the pick-up and transportation of goods shall fill out a "Consignment Form for Pick-up and Transportation of Goods" at the department, and the department can arrange transportation upon agreement. However, if it is a large batch of materials, a separate consignment contract must be signed. 3. There are no restrictions on the types of goods to be transported, but the following will not be accepted for consignment: 1. Contraband, 2. Valuables, 3. Dangerous goods, 4. Goods that are easily perishable or reduced in quantity, 5. Goods with incomplete packaging. If the consignor deliberately mixes in contraband, thereby violating laws and regulations or causing disasters, the consignor shall bear all responsibilities. 4. The department only assumes the responsibility of an agent for the goods transported. If there is any shortage, breakage, or loss during the journey, the department will claim compensation from the carrier, but will not be directly responsible for compensation. It shall not be liable for any losses or delays in transportation due to natural disasters or force majeure. 5. All transportation and miscellaneous fees for the consigned goods must be paid in advance before shipment. If the scope of the consignment is large and the cost cannot be estimated, the consignor shall deposit a considerable amount of reserve funds for payment, and shall be notified to make additional payments at any time if the funds are insufficient. 6. In addition to collecting warehouse rent when the goods are stored in the department's warehouse, the department will charge a handling fee for other agency matters based on the complexity of the matter (the standard for collecting handling fees is specified separately). Detailed procedures are available in the department's business rules for reference.
