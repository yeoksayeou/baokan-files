Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 16th (Delayed dispatch): The Executive Committee of the International Association of Journalists held its first formal meeting on the 16th, presided over by the association's vice-chairman, Eugene. The association's chairman, Kenyon (England), did not attend despite being urged by telegram and waiting for him for 24 hours after adjournment.

Association Secretary-General Hronek reported on the association's work at the meeting, denouncing the crimes of imperialism and its hired journalists in instigating anti-Soviet and anti-people wars. He also listed the close ties between the International Association of Journalists and other peace-loving and democratic international organizations such as the World Peace Congress, the World Federation of Trade Unions, the Women's International Democratic Federation, and the World Federation of Democratic Youth. The Association of Journalists will also send representatives to the Asian Women's Representatives Conference to be held in Peiping this winter. When discussing the future International Conference of Journalists, he said that the main topics to be discussed at the conference should be: (1) Journalists fight to defend world peace, and (2) Safeguarding the welfare of journalists.

After approving the admission of China, Albania, Free Greece, and East Germany to the International Organization of Journalists, Eugene extended a warm welcome to these four newly participating member organizations, saying: The great victory of the heroic Chinese people has made a significant contribution to world peace. The participation of progressive Chinese journalists has further strengthened the power of the Association of Journalists. Eugene then praised the Albanian journalists for their resolute struggle for internationalism and for leading Albania on the path of socialism, and praised the efforts of progressive East German journalists in the struggle against fascism and against the US-British imperialist warmongers' attempt to use West Germany as a base for aggression. He said: The International Association of Journalists is honored to accept the free Greek journalists' organization, which is fighting heroically for national independence and democracy, as a member. He hoped that the new member organizations would advance alongside other progressive journalists in the world, oppose warmongers, and fight for democracy and lasting peace.

The Executive Committee meeting is scheduled to continue at 12:00 noon on the 17th. To date, journalist organizations from twenty-six countries have joined the International Association of Journalists.

On the evening of the 16th, the Czech Journalists Association hosted a banquet for the representatives of various countries attending the Executive Committee of the Association of Journalists. Dozens of Czech writers and foreign progressive journalists were present.
