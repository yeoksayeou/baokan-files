　　Endorsing the Implementation of a Three-Tier Fiscal System

    The Finance Department of the North China People's Government, in order to study the fiscal system for the entire region next year, invited democratic figures to a symposium after proposing a preliminary plan for a three-tier fiscal system. At the symposium, everyone unanimously expressed their support for the three-tier fiscal system, proving that this is the correct direction for future financial work. Why should a three-tier fiscal system be implemented? In terms of the current national situation, the People's Liberation War is about to conclude victoriously nationwide. All areas that have cleared out armed enemy bandits will devote all their strength to restoring and developing production. In order to promote production and accelerate the construction of the New Democracy, proposing a fiscal system suitable for the people's democratic regime and future new economic and cultural construction work is of great historical significance.

    During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War and the entire period of the People's Liberation War, we were in a wartime and rural environment. In order to facilitate the struggle against the enemy and support the front lines, we implemented a system of partitioned governance and a fiscal system of mostly centralized, partially mobile finance. This was completely necessary and correct at the time. Today, the situation is different. The New Political Consultative Conference is about to convene, and a unified national situation is about to emerge. The old liberated areas' border regions and administrative offices will gradually change their divisions according to the new situation, or restore the old provincial or county governance, in order to more effectively concentrate national human, financial, and material resources to engage in political, economic, cultural, and national defense construction. In order to adapt to this political system and smoothly carry out various constructions, our fiscal system must change its past practices and adopt a central, provincial, and county three-tier fiscal system, which, in the current stage, is completely reasonable and necessary. All of us government workers should seriously pay attention to studying this fiscal system, learning its policy spirit, and relevant knowledge in all aspects.

    In addition to being suitable for today's situation, the three-tier fiscal system is also adapted to the national geographic conditions. Our country has such a vast territory and such a large population, and the foundations of political, economic, and cultural work in each province, county, and city are extremely different. This situation is not conducive to complete centralization. We know that there are great imbalances in various tasks between the old liberated areas and the new liberated areas, between the rich and the poor areas, and between areas with and without work. Inconvenient transportation increases the difficulties caused by this imbalance. Therefore, our fiscal system must be appropriately centralized in order to unify planning, and it should also be appropriately divided for management in order to achieve, on the one hand, strengthening local administrative efficiency and giving play to creativity and initiative, so that it can adapt to local conditions and develop various undertakings that should be developed and reformed in various places, and on the other hand, enabling the central government to concentrate financial resources, comprehensively lead national economic construction, and guide local areas in carrying out production and construction work.

    In short, the new fiscal system is still a new issue in our fiscal construction, and we hope to arouse the research of responsible comrades from all parties. Fiscal work is extremely closely related to national construction and people's production, and it is necessary to seriously and practically formulate correct principles and methods that meet the people's requirements. This is the people's requirement, and it is also the main task of the upcoming fiscal conference.

### 赞同实施三级财政体制

　　赞同实施三级财政体制
    华北人民政府财政部为了研究明年全区的财政体制，在提出三级财政体制的初步方案以后，邀请了民主人士举行座谈。座谈会上大家对三级财政体制一致表示赞同，证明这是今后财政工作的正确方向。为什么要实行三级财政体制呢？就今天的全国形势来说，人民解放战争即将在全国范围内胜利结束，凡是肃清了武装敌人土匪的地区均将以全部力量投入恢复与发展生产事业，为了推动生产，加速新民主主义的建设工作，提出一种适合于人民民主政权体制与今后新的经济文化建设工作的财政体制，是具有非常重要的历史意义的。
    八年抗战以及在人民解放战争的整个时期，我们是处在战争与农村的环境，为了便利对敌斗争，支援前线，曾实行过分区而治，以及大部集中，小部机动的财政体制，这在当时是完全必要的正确的。今天情形已不同了。新政治协商会议即将召开，全国统一的局面即将出现，老解放区的边区，行署，已均将逐渐按照新的情况改变区划，或者恢复旧的省治或县治，以便更有效地集中全国人力、财力、物力，从事政治的、经济的、文化的及国防的建设。为了适应这种政治体制，顺利开展各种建设，我们的财政体制必须改变过去作法，采取中央、省、县三级财政体制，在现阶段说来，是完全合理的必要的。我们一切政权工作者都应当认真注意研究这一财政体制，学习它的政策精神，以及有关的各方面的知识。
    三级财政体制除了适合于今天的情况以外，也适应于全国的地理条件。我们国家的幅圆这样广大，人口这样众多，各省县市的政治经济文化各种工作基础又极不相同，这种情况是不利于完全集中的。我们知道，在老解放区与新解放区，富庶区与贫瘠区，有工作与无工作区之间，各种工作是存在着很大的不平衡。交通不便，增加了这种不平衡所造成的困难。因此我们的财政体制，既须适当集中，以便统一计划，又应适当地分工管理以便达到一方面加强地方行政效能，发挥创造性和积极性，使能因地制宜，兴办各地应兴应革之事业，另一方面也使中央政府能够集中财政力量，统盘领导国家经济建设，指导地方进行生产建设工作。
    总之，新的财政体制，在我们财政建设中还是一个新问题，希望能引起各方负责同志研究。财政工作同国家建设人民生产有着极其密切的关系，必须严肃而切实地制定切合人民要求的正确原则和办法。这是人民的要求，也是即将召开的财政会议的主要任务。
