Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, 2nd: The People's Liberation Army Fujian Front Headquarters has announced the course of the Fuzhou Campaign, stating: Our army advanced thousands of miles, traversing towering mountains and ridges, battling intense heat, torrential rain, disease, and hunger, and victoriously reached the Min River line. Starting from August 13th, we launched the Fuzhou Campaign, which concluded victoriously on the 22nd, lasting only ten days. We annihilated over 50,000 remnant Kuomintang bandit troops, liberated Fuzhou, the capital of Fujian Province, and dozens of important military port towns, and completely controlled the Min River, as well as most of the Min-Zhe-Gan, Min-Zhe, and Fu-Xia highways, creating favorable conditions for the liberation of all of Fujian and the liberation of Taiwan.

　　The entire campaign can be divided into two stages: The first stage, from the 13th to before dawn on the 17th, saw our army clear out the bandit army's outer strongholds around Fuzhou, completely cutting off the bandit's sea and land escape routes, and advancing directly to the city of Fuzhou. The opening battle of this stage was our army's rapid and sudden action on the north bank of the Min River, with the left-wing army traversing mountains and ridges, marching a hundred *li* at night, and launching an attack on Danyang Town, a vital town more than one hundred *li* northeast of Fuzhou, at 7:30 AM on the 13th, capturing the town at 10:00 AM. The defending enemy, the 216th Division of the 74th Army (less one battalion), was annihilated in part, and the remainder fled northeast, only to be completely annihilated by us in the northeast area of Danyang on the 14th, with the bandit division commander Ou Yuanhuai captured. More than 1,000 men of the 646th Regiment of the same division surrendered to us in Luoyuan County on the 15th. Our main force then quickly bypassed Lianjiang City and went straight for the vital areas of Min'an Town and Mawei in the lower reaches of the Min River. On the morning of the 15th, we captured Min'an, controlling vital areas such as Tingtou and Longbing. On the afternoon of the 16th, we captured Mawei, Changmen, @tou and other fortresses in the lower reaches of the Min River. At the same time, a part of our army captured Lianjiang. By this time, the vital areas along the entire north bank of the Min River were completely under our control, and the bandit army's sea escape route was blocked. At noon on the 16th, our heroic artillery also sank the bandit warship "Jianguo," which was fleeing from the Min River to the sea, and damaged three others. Our army, attacking the outer strongholds of the bandits in Fuzhou, captured Tunxi, 20 *li* from Fuzhou, on the 16th, and occupied the important highlands along the Dabeiling line, the main position of the bandits' outer defenses, before 4:00 AM on the 17th, pressing directly on the city of Fuzhou.

　　Simultaneously with the advance of the left-wing army, our right-wing army on the south bank of the Min River, after occupying Yongtai City, 150 *li* southwest of Fuzhou, on the 11th, immediately marched rapidly, traversing towering mountains and ridges, and launched a surprise attack on Fuqing and Changle, southeast of Fuzhou, from a distance of 200 *li*. At 11:00 PM on the afternoon of the 15th, we captured Honglu Town, 120 *li* south of Fuzhou, cutting off the Fu-Xia Highway. At 9:00 AM on the morning of the 16th, we captured Fuqing City. At 3:00 AM on the morning of the 17th, we took advantage of the victory to capture Changle, and controlled the important towns of Yingqian, Shanggan, and Koucun on the opposite bank of Mawei, echoing the left-wing army occupying Min'an and Mawei on the north bank of the Min River across the river. By this time, the lower reaches of the Min River had been completely blockaded by our army, and Fuzhou was surrounded on all sides.

　　Our central route army's main force occupied Minqing County and the important towns of Daruo and Xiaoruo on the 15th, and advanced along the left bank of the Min River towards Baisha and Ganzhe. Another unit occupied Shuangxi on the 14th, and then captured the key points of Dahu, Xuefeng, and Daping northwest of Fuzhou, while coordinating the attack on Baisha. On the 14th, our army occupied Baisha and Ganzhe, and controlled the Zhutiting line, 23 *li* northwest of Fuzhou. On the morning of the 16th, we captured Hengsong, Xujiacun, Bi Ge, Xiaobeiling and other places ten *li* west of Fuzhou. By this time, the first phase of the battle had been successfully completed.

　　The second stage, from 5:00 AM on the morning of the 17th, when we stormed into Fuzhou City, to the 22nd, when we completely annihilated the enemy fleeing south from Fuzhou. At 5:00 AM on the 17th, a part of our army stormed into Fuzhou City from the east, west, and north sides, from Xiaobeiling in the north of Fuzhou and Dabeiling in the northeast, annihilating more than 2,000 bandits. By 7:00 AM, Fuzhou City was completely liberated (previously mistaken for noon). The remnants of the bandits fled in a panic across the Min River via Nantai and Wulongjiang. A group of fleeing bandits, including a part of the Fuzhou Pacification Headquarters, the 6th Army Corps Headquarters, and the 25th Army, were intercepted and compressed by another unit of our army in the mountainous area more than ten *li* northeast of Fuqing on the 18th, and completely annihilated that afternoon at 6:00 PM, capturing a total of 12,500 officers and soldiers, including the chief and deputy chiefs of staff of the bandit 6th Army Corps, He Tongtang and Chen Tengxiang. Another group of fleeing bandits, the 96th Army (including the 106th Army and part of the 40th Division of the 25th Army), fled to the east of Yongtai and the northwest area of Yongtai, and were also completely encircled and annihilated by us, capturing 6,000 officers and soldiers, including the deputy commander of the bandit 96th Army, Huang Zhentao, and the commander of the 212th Division, Long Yingkui. By this time, of the 58,000-odd Kuomintang bandit troops originally based in Fuzhou and its surrounding areas, all were annihilated except for the 73rd Army Headquarters leading a division which fled to Pingtan Island and some scattered remnants. The Fuzhou Campaign was thus victoriously concluded.

　　千里进军十天歼匪五万解放福州全部控制闽江
  　前线司令部公布福州战役经过
    【新华社福建前线二日电】人民解放军福建前线司令部顷公布福州战役经过称：我军千里进军，翻越丛山峻岭，与酷暑、暴雨、疾病、饥饿相搏斗，胜利进抵闽江之线，自八月十三日起发起福州战役，至二十二日胜利结束，历时仅十天，歼国民党残余匪军五万余人，解放福建省省会福州市及重要军港城镇数十处，全部控制闽江，及闽浙赣、闽浙公路与福厦公路大部，为解放全福建及解放台湾创造了有利条件。
    全役可分为两个阶段：第一阶段自十三日至十七日拂晓前止，我军扫清匪军福州外围据点，完全切断匪海陆逃路，直抵福州城下。此一阶段之序幕战，为我闽江北岸左翼大军以迅速突然动作，翻山越岭，夜行百里，于十三日晨七时半向福州东北百余里之要镇丹阳镇发起攻击，并于十时攻占该镇。守敌七十四军二一六师师部及两个团（缺一个营），一部就歼，一部向东北逃窜，复于十四日，为我全歼于丹阳东北地区，匪师长欧元怀就擒。该师之六四六团千余人亦于十五日在罗源县城向我投降。我主力乃迅即绕过连江城，直取闽江下游之闽安镇、马尾等要地。十五日清晨我攻占闽安，控制亭头、龙柄等要地，十六日下午攻占马尾、长门、＠头等闽江下游要塞，同时我军一部攻克连江。至此闽江北岸一线要地完全为我控制，匪军海上逃路被封锁。十六日午我英勇炮兵并击沉由闽江向海上逃逸之匪军舰“建国”号一艘，并击伤其三艘。攻击福州匪外围据点之我军，于十六日攻占距福州二十里之屯溪，十七日四时前占领匪外围主要阵地大北岭一线重要高地，直逼福州城下。
    与左翼大军挺进同时，我闽江南岸右翼大军十一日占领福州西南一百五十里之永泰城后，即以高速度急行军，翻越丛山峻岭，自二百里远距离外奔袭福州东南之福清、长乐等城。十五日下午十一时，攻占福州以南一百二十华里之宏路镇，切断福厦公路，十六日晨九时攻占福清城，十七日晨三时复乘胜攻占长乐，并控制马尾对岸重镇营前、尚干、口场等要镇，与闽江北岸占领闽安、马尾之左翼大军隔江呼应。至此，闽江下游已被我军完全封锁，福州乃陷我四面包围。
    我中路大军主力于十五日占领闽清县城及要镇大箬、小箬后，沿闽江左岸向白沙、甘蔗攻击前进。另部十四日于占领双溪后，续克福州西北之大湖、雪峰、大坪等要点，同时配合着向白沙进攻。十四日我军占领白沙、甘蔗，并控制福州西北二十三里之猪蹄亭一线，十六日上午攻占福州以西十里之横嵩、徐家村、笔哿小北岭等地。至此，第一阶段作战任务胜利完成。
    第二阶段自十七日晨五时攻入福州市起，至二十二日全歼由福州南逃之敌止。十七日五时，我军一部自福州以北之小北岭及东北之大北岭等地，从东、西、北三面攻入福州市，歼匪二千余人，至七时，福州市即告完全解放（前误为中午）。残匪狼狈越闽江经南台、乌龙江溃窜。溃匪一股包括福州绥署、六兵团司令部、二十五军等一部于十八日为我另部堵截压缩于福清东北十多里之山区，当日下午六时将其完全歼灭，共俘匪六兵团正副参谋长何同棠、陈腾骧以下官兵一万二千五百余人。另股溃匪九十六军（包括合编该军之一○六军及二十五军四十师之一部）窜抵永泰以东及永泰西北地区，亦被我全部围歼，俘匪九十六军副军长黄振涛，二一二师师长龙英魁以下官兵六千人。至此，原踞福州及其外围之国民党匪军五万八千余人，除七十三军军部率一个师窜逃平潭岛及一部溃散外，全部被歼，福州战役遂告胜利结束。
