　　New President Deng Chumin
  　Talks About Shanxi University's Education Policy
    Focusing on Developing Colleges of Engineering, Agriculture, and Medicine in Coordination with Production and Construction, and Utilizing Natural Conditions

    [Our newspaper's special dispatch from Beiping] National Shanxi University is scheduled to start enrollment in Ping (Beiping) on September 17th. To understand the current situation of Shanxi University and its future improvement plans, this reporter paid a special visit to the newly appointed President of Shanxi University, Deng Chumin, yesterday.

    President Deng said: Under the Kuomintang's extremely reactionary rule, Shanxi University's teachers and students had no freedom to study or conduct any academic research. Especially because the bandit Yan Xishan defended Taiyuan for a long time, Shanxi University suffered extensive damage, particularly to the equipment of the Colleges of Engineering and Medicine. Fortunately, the North China People's Government, the North China Higher Education Commission, and the Shanxi local government all value this school and are determined to run it well. Because in such a vast area as Jin-Cha-Sui-Meng, Shanxi University is the only institution of higher learning. The urgent task at present is for all teachers and students of Shanxi University to work together under the leadership of the North China government and the Higher Education Commission, and with the assistance of the Shanxi local government, to overcome difficulties and gradually develop Shanxi University.

    In order to develop Shanxi University, President Deng then put forward an urgent hope. He hoped that specialists and famous professors with advanced ideas and excellent knowledge would actively participate in the various departments of Shanxi University. Although Jin-Cha-Sui-Meng is a relatively remote and backward area, the primary task of building a new China is not only to rapidly exchange urban and rural areas in terms of material and economy, but also to rapidly achieve urban and rural exchanges in terms of culture and spirit. Shanxi University sincerely welcomes advanced people in the cultural field to jointly participate in this cultural construction work.

    Talking about the future direction of Shanxi University, President Deng said: Any cultural and educational undertaking cannot be separated from practical needs. Jin-Cha-Sui-Meng, especially the entire territory of Shanxi, is rich in coal and iron production, making it the second most important heavy industrial base in our country after the Northeast. In order to cooperate with production and construction and to utilize natural conditions, Shanxi University's future development focus should be placed on the three colleges of engineering, agriculture, and medicine, especially the College of Engineering.

    Shanxi University originally had four colleges: engineering, medicine, liberal arts, and law. Now, in order to meet the needs, the College of Liberal Arts has been changed to the Teachers College, with three departments temporarily set up: Department of Education, Department of Literature, History and Geography, and Department of Foreign Languages (English and Russian); the College of Law has been changed to the College of Finance and Economics, with two departments temporarily set up: Department of Economics and Department of Business Administration. The College of Medicine has merged with the former Chuanzhi Medical College, Changzhi Medical School, and Midwifery School into one college, with more abundant talents, equipment, and medicine than before; while the College of Engineering originally only had two departments: Civil Engineering and Electrical Engineering, now it has been expanded to four departments: Civil Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Mining and Metallurgy, and Chemical Engineering. In addition, it is also planned to set up a College of Agriculture. The Higher Education Commission also plans to merge the former China University's College of Science into Shanxi University. In the future, the sites of the College of Science and the College of Agriculture are planned to be located in Taigu. Because Taigu already has a modern scale, with the Mingxian School site available for use, a large farm for practice, and convenient transportation, it is easy to take care of. These are all planned to put Shanxi University's future focus on the three colleges of engineering, agriculture, and medicine. Naturally, Shanxi University still attaches great importance to departments such as liberal arts, law, political science, and economics.

    [Another News] The Shanxi University Professors' Association, Lecturers' and Assistants' Association, Staff Union, and Student Union have jointly sent a telegram to welcome President Deng to the school as soon as possible. Deng has replied with thanks and said that he will go to Taiyuan as soon as his official duties are completed.

　　新任校长邓初民
  　畅谈山大教育方针
    配合生产建设利用自然条件将着重发展工农医三个学院
    【本报北平专讯】国立山西大学定于九月十七日起在平招生。记者为欲明了山大近况及今后改进计划，昨天特走访新任山大校长邓初民。
    邓校长说：山大历年在国民党极端反动统治下，师生已无读书及一切学术研究之自由。尤其因为阎匪久守太原，山大横遭破坏，特别是工、医学院等设备方面，遭受到极大破坏。好在华北人民政府，华北高等教育委员会及山西地方政府都重视这个学校，都决心要把这个学校办好。因为在晋察绥蒙这样一块广阔的地面上，只有山大这样一个最高学府。当前的急务是山大全体师生一致在华府及高教会的领导下，山西地方政府的协助下，共同努力克服困难，逐步使山大向前发展。
    为了发展山大，邓校长接着提出一个迫切的希望。希望能有思想前进，学识优长的专门家、名教授踊跃地参加到山大各院系来。晋察绥蒙虽然是较偏僻，较落后的地区，但建设新中国的首要任务，不仅在物质上、经济上，要迅速使城乡交流，而且要在文化上、精神上迅速做到城乡交流。山大竭诚欢迎文化界先进人士，共同来参加这份文化建设的工作。
    谈到山大今后的方针时，邓校长说：任何文教事业都是离不开实际需要的。晋察绥蒙，尤其是山西全境，煤铁产量丰富，为我国仅次于东北之重工业基地。为配合生产建设，为利用自然条件，山大今后发展重点，当放在工农医三学院方面，尤其是工学院。
    山大原有工、医、文、法等四个学院。现因适应需要，特将文学院改为师范学院，暂设教育系、文史地系、外国语文（英、俄）系等三系；将法学院改为财经学院，暂设经济系、工商管理两系。医学院则合并川至医专、长治医校、助产学校为一院，人才、设备、医药均较前充实；而工学院原只有土木、电机二系，现在扩充为土木、电机、矿冶、化工四系。此外，还拟筹设农学院一所。高教会并拟将前中国大学理学院也合并到山大去。将来理学院、农学院院址，拟设于太谷。因太谷早具近代化的规模，有铭贤学校校址可供利用，有广大农场可资实习，而且交通方便，易于照顾。这都是为把山大今后重点放在工农医三院方面而计划的。自然，山大对文法、政经等系仍极为重视。
    【又讯】山大教授会、讲助会、职工会及学生会已联名来电欢迎邓校长早日到校，邓氏已复电致谢，并谓一俟公毕，即去太原。
