Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 31st - TASS, New York: The fascist attack on August 27th in Peekskill has aroused the fiercest protests from progressives. They demand an investigation and punishment of those who directed the violent actions that prevented the Robeson concert from taking place. The Communist Party National Committee said in its statement: "Fascist reactionaries seized power in Peekskill on August 27th. The American people saw the kind of America nurtured by Beale Street and hated by Robeson. The flames of Hitler burning books are no more vicious than the flames of the mobs destroying musical scores in this lynching prepared for Robeson. This is the fruit of Truman's bipartisan policy. This is the measure of the Truman administration and Congress's betrayal of the traditions of Jefferson, Lincoln, and Roosevelt. The planning and execution of this violent act by fascists were meticulous. Truman's Attorney General and the recently appointed Supreme Court Justice Clark sent a signal, indicating anyone on the 'subversive list'. The mobs of the American Legion and the Catholic War Veterans and their leaders merely brought this policy to a logical conclusion. Medina's 'justice' performance in Foley Square (where the leaders of the American Communist Party were tried - editor) foreshadows that judges will protect the perpetrators of such atrocities." The statement concluded by calling on all Americans, regardless of political party, to unite and demand that Truman, Dewey, and other authorities immediately take action to punish the criminals who participated in the Peekskill atrocities and violated the rights of black people.
    The Worker, the Compass, and the New York Herald Tribune all published more detailed accounts of the fascist attack on the Robeson concert, clearly indicating that the mobs intended to lynch Robeson. Newspaper reports emphasized that the police have not arrested a single perpetrator of the Peekskill atrocities to date, although everyone knows who these perpetrators are. The newspapers also emphasized that the atrocities were meticulously planned in advance. The New York Herald Tribune reported that the so-called "Peekskill United Veterans Committee" held a meeting in the office of Westchester County Assistant District Attorney Reubenfeld on August 25th. The Worker reported that a week before the concert, the Peekskill newspaper "Peekskill Star" began publishing provocative telegrams intended to incite readers to use violence. The telegram emphasized that Attorney General Clark and the Un-American Activities Committee listed the Civil Rights Congress as a "subversive" group and urged the adoption of violent actions against its members.
    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 1st - TASS, New York, 31st: The atrocities of the American fascists in Peekskill have aroused strong protests. A committee to protest the Peekskill atrocities has been established. This committee includes prominent American progressives: Patterson, secretary of the Civil Rights Congress; Andrews, former New York State Assemblyman; Huner, member of the New York Committee Against Discrimination; Pastor Hale; and Brewer, leader of the Progressive Veterans Organization. The committee convened a mass protest meeting in Harlem, where Robeson had sung. New York City Councilor Davis, who is black, proposed a bill on August 30th, and Senator Taylor spoke in Washington, demanding a thorough investigation of the Peekskill atrocities organized by fascists and punishment of the murderers. New York Governor Dewey receives hundreds of telegrams every day protesting this atrocity, demanding an investigation and punishment of the fascist thugs.
    At a protest meeting held in Westchester County (New York State), where Peekskill is located, writer Fast and other progressives gave speeches. The United Fur Workers Union issued a special statement pointing out that this fascist attack was created by the policy of "Trumanism." The responsibility for the fascist atrocities must be borne by the founders and supporters of Trumanism and the Marshall Plan, and by those who organized the "Cold War" and are currently preparing for a new war. The statement declared: We have fought against fascists abroad, and we must fight against them at home with the same strength and determination. In the coming days, Robeson will speak at the American Labor Party's campaign rallies in the Bronx and Manhattan. An editorial in the Worker pointed out that the attempted lynching of Robeson in Peekskill is as significant to America as the burning of books by Hitler's followers was to Germany. The Worker calls for an active struggle against the growing fascist threat in the United States.
    Democratic newspapers, especially the Compass, have received many letters from individuals and groups, requesting them to publish their firm protests against the fascist atrocities of the American reactionaries' lackeys. The New York branch of the United Government and Municipal Workers Union, which has 20,000 members, also demanded that Truman and Dewey order the judicial authorities to investigate the fascist atrocities and punish the murderers.

　　杜鲁门政府纵使法西斯行凶
    美共发表抗议声明
  　各界组成抗议暴行委会要求惩凶
    【新华社北平三十一日电】塔斯社纽约讯：法西斯分子八月二十七日在毕克斯吉尔镇的攻击，已激起进步人士最猛烈的抗议。他们要求调查和惩办使罗伯逊音乐会没有开成的暴力行动的指使者。共产党全国委员会在其声明中说：“法西斯反动派八月二十七日在毕克斯吉尔攫取了政权。美国人民看见了为毕尔街所培育的，为罗伯逊所憎恨的那种美国。希特勒焚毁书籍的火焰也不比暴徒们在这次为罗伯逊所准备的私刑中烧毁音乐乐谱的火焰更为恶毒。这就是杜鲁门两党一致政策的果实。这是测量杜鲁门政府和国会背叛杰弗逊、林肯和罗斯福传统的尺度。法西斯分子的这一暴力行为的计划与执行，都很周密。杜鲁门的司法部长和最近任命的最高法院法官克拉克发出信号，指示‘谋叛名单’上的任何人。美国退伍军人团和天主教退伍军人的暴徒及其领袖，仅仅使这一政策得到一个逻辑的结果。麦迪纳在福莱广场（美共领袖在该处受审——编者）的‘正义’表演，预示法官将保护这样暴行的行凶者。”声明在结语时号召一切美国人不分政治党派，一致要求杜鲁门、杜威及其他当局立即采取行动，惩办参加毕克斯吉尔暴行及侵犯黑人权利的犯罪者。
    工人日报、指南针日报及纽约先驱论坛报均刊载更多关于法西斯分子攻击罗伯逊音乐会的详情记载，清＠指明暴徒们打算对罗伯逊施以私刑。报纸消息强调指出，警察对于毕克斯吉尔暴行案的行凶者迄今连一个都没有逮捕，虽然众皆周知这些行凶者是谁。各报并强调，暴行事先有周密计划。纽约先驱论坛报报道，所谓“毕克斯吉尔联合退伍军人委员会”八月二十五日曾在西察斯特尔县的区助理检察官鲁本菲尔德的办公室中举行会议。工人日报报道，在音乐会开始前一周，毕克斯吉尔报纸“毕克斯吉尔明星报”就开始发表意图煽动读者使用暴力的挑衅性电讯。电讯曾强调，司法部长克拉克与非美活动调查委员会将民权大会列为“谋叛”团体，并敦促对该会会员采用暴力行动。
    【新华社北平一日电】塔斯社纽约三十一日讯：美法西斯分子在毕克斯吉尔的暴行，已引起强有力的抗议。抗议毕克斯吉尔暴行的委员会，已经成立。这个委员会包括著名的美国进步人士：保障民权大会书记柏德逊，前纽约州议员安朱斯，纽约反对各族歧视委员会委员胡纳，牧师海莱，进步退伍军人组织领袖布鲁尔等人。该委员会在罗伯逊曾经演唱的地方——哈勒姆，召集群众抗议大会。纽约市议员黑人戴维斯于八月三十日提出议案，参议员泰勒在华盛顿演讲，要求澈底调查法西斯分子组织的毕克斯吉尔暴行并惩办凶手。纽约州长杜威每日都收到数百封抗议这次暴行的电报，要求调查和惩罚法西斯流氓。
    在毕克斯吉尔所属的西察斯特尔县（纽约州）举行的抗议大会上，作家法斯特和其他进步人士在会上发表演说。产联毛皮工会发表特别声明指出：这次法西斯攻击是“杜鲁门主义”的政策所制造的。法西斯暴行的责任必须由杜鲁门主义和马歇尔计划的创始人和支持者来承担，必须由那些组织“冷战”而目前又在准备新战争的人们来承担。该声明宣称：我们曾经对国外的法西斯分子进行斗争，我们在国内也要以同样的力量和决心对他们进行斗争。在未来数日内，罗伯逊将在美国劳工党在布郎克斯及曼赫吞的竞选大会上发表演说。工人日报的社论指出：在毕克斯吉尔对罗伯逊施以私刑的企图对于美国的意义和希特勒分子的焚毁书籍对于德国的意义一样。工人日报呼吁对美国日益增长的法西斯威胁，进行积极的斗争。
    民主报纸，特别是指南针日报，收到了许多个人与团体的来信，要求发表他们对美国反动派走狗的法西斯暴行的坚决抗议。拥有二万名会员的产联政府与市府公务员工会的纽约分会也要求杜鲁门和杜威下令司法当局调查此次法西斯暴行并惩办凶手。
