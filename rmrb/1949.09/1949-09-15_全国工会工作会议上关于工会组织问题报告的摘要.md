　　Summary of the Report on Trade Union Organization Issues at the National Trade Union Work Conference
　　Xiao Ming, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, speaks

　　Based on the needs of the revolutionary victory and the task instructed by Comrade Shaoqi to basically organize all workers in the country in about a year, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions discussed and decided on the organizational issues of trade unions at this conference.

　　I. The Name of the Trade Union

　　Currently, the names of trade unions are not uniform across regions; some are called "Gong Hui" (工会, Trade Union), and others are called "Zhi Gong Hui" (职工会, Employees' Union). Some people think that "Zhi Gong Hui" means a joint association of staff and workers, but in fact, "Zhi Gong Hui" originally meant a professional trade union. Because in feudal society, trade unions were organized by industry. During the capitalist period, trade unions were still organized by profession. After the October Revolution, Soviet trade unions adopted the model of organizing trade unions by industry. The advantages of organizing trade unions by industry are: in the capitalist period, one industry has one trade union, and workers are less susceptible to division by capitalists, making united struggles more coordinated and powerful. In the period of New Democracy and Socialism, it is conducive to the development of production. Therefore, we should learn from the Soviet Union to organize trade unions by industry and unify the names of trade unions to be uniformly called "Gong Hui" (Trade Union).

　　II. The Nature of the Trade Union

　　The trade union is a mass organization of the working class. This can be explained in three aspects.

　　(1) The trade union is a class-based organization of the working class. All employed laborers who rely on wages and salaries for all or most of their livelihood, whether manual or mental laborers (referring to individual composition, regardless of their family background), belong to the working class and can participate in the trade union. The supply system is one form of wage. Cadres on the supply system can of course participate in the trade union. The Communist Party is the vanguard of the working class. Party members should not only participate in the trade union but also be exemplary members.

　　(2) The trade union is a broad mass organization of the working class. Anyone belonging to the working class, regardless of their political or religious beliefs, can participate in the trade union. Therefore, the trade union should organize all workers, not just 90%. Of course, it is not necessarily 100% (such as die-hard reactionary elements among the workers, etc., who cannot participate in the trade union), but rather organize almost 100% of the workers into the trade union. Therefore, we should be careful not to commit the error of closed-doorism.

　　(3) The trade union is an organized and disciplined organization of the working class. Trade union members are different from ordinary scattered masses. Trade union members are organized masses. Trade union members must act in accordance with the trade union charter, obey the resolutions of the trade union, pay membership dues, and do trade union work. Therefore, only with discipline can the trade union ensure the consistency of members' actions. Currently, some of our trade union work is done very well, but some have committed formalism. A member simply raises their hand or registers, and that's considered membership. They don't pay membership dues or do trade union work. Such a trade union is an unorganized and undisciplined trade union, and it cannot play a role.

　　III. On the Issue of Trade Union Membership

　　(1) Who can join the trade union? All those who belong to the working class can join the trade union. Newly entered factory workers can be divided into three types: (A) Those from laboring backgrounds and students can join the trade union immediately. (B) Those from non-laboring backgrounds must have more than one year of work experience and be recognized by the masses before they can join the trade union. (C) Those from exploiting or oppressing backgrounds must have more than two years of work experience and be recognized by the masses before they can join the trade union. Those who were previously leaders of the Kuomintang, the Three People's Principles Youth League, and special agent organs, reactionary elements who undermined the interests of workers, and foremen who oppressed workers, etc., must participate in labor for more than two years, confess to the masses, admit their mistakes, be determined to correct their errors, and be recognized by the masses before they can join the trade union.

　　(2) Who cannot join the trade union? (A) Those whose main or large part of their livelihood comes from exploiting income, such as capitalists and their agents or contractors, and employees who are also shareholders whose exploiting income accounts for the main source of their livelihood, cannot join the trade union. (B) Prisoners who have been deprived of their civil rights, whose sentences have not expired and who have not restored their civil rights, shall not join the trade union.

　　(3) Membership application procedures: The past problems were either no procedures, formalism, or procedures that were too strict. There should be certain procedures for membership application: request, introduction, group discussion, approval by the trade union committee. Whether the introduction procedure can be cancelled is still under consideration; group discussion is a must, as it is a way of being recognized by the masses.

　　IV. Democratic Life in the Trade Union

　　Currently, the most dangerous problem in our trade union work is official-run trade unions, commandism, and paternalism. To change this situation, we must implement democracy in the trade union. Democracy is the soul of the trade union. Without democracy, the trade union becomes a corpse. To implement democratic life in the trade union, we must act according to the following three points.

　　(1) Implement a comprehensive democratic election system: Trade union cadres should be produced through democratic elections. Candidates should be nominated at the general meeting, introduced to the masses, solicited for endorsements, passed, and the number of candidates determined, followed by secret ballot elections. Using worker representative meetings to cultivate activists among the workers is the best way.

　　(2) All issues of the trade union must be discussed democratically, with the minority obeying the majority, using democratic methods to solve them. Never allow a few cadres to force commands. Trade unions also have centralization, and lower-level trade unions must obey higher-level trade unions. But persuading the masses and making them willing to accept our opinions is the basic working method.

　　(3) Implement "everyone runs the trade union." Every member must take on a trade union job. This not only reduces, or even eliminates, trade union cadres who are detached from production, but also solves the problems of paternalism, detachment from the masses in trade union work, and strengthens the spirit of unity and mutual assistance among the working class.

　　V. Trade Union Organizational System

　　We must solve the trade union organization problem based on the basic spirit of the Soviet Union's organization of trade unions by industry, combined with our actual situation. Comrade Shaoqi instructed us: In cities, trade unions can be divided into six types, namely: industrial trade unions, handicraft trade unions, shop employee trade unions, porter trade unions, cultural and educational worker trade unions, and organ worker trade unions. We basically follow this instruction. Among them, it is impossible to organize only one industrial trade union. It should be established according to the administrative system of the industry. Small industrial sectors can establish industrial trade union federations.

　　Of the above six types of trade unions, only three have mature conditions to establish national organizations: railways, seamen, and postal services. These three national trade unions should be established immediately. Those with relatively mature conditions are: textile, coal mining, hardware, and education worker trade unions. The conditions for others are not yet mature enough. Therefore, local and regional trade unions are still quite important at present.

　　Based on the above situation, our trade union organization should have two systems: the industrial trade union system and the local trade union system. The correct relationship between these two systems should be: Issues related to industrial unity are under the leadership of the industrial trade union, such as production plans, labor conditions, and wage systems; local issues are uniformly led by the local trade union, such as wage payment standards, organizing commemorative events, etc. As for daily work, in places outside the location of the national industrial trade union, the daily work of the local industrial trade union is led by the local trade union.

　　VI. How to Establish a Trade Union

　　We should adopt a top-down approach to establish trade unions, because today the working class has seized political power, and the establishment of trade unions should adopt a large-scale, open, top-down approach. For example, to establish a city-wide trade union in a certain industry, the preparatory committee of the municipal federation of trade unions should first convene a worker representative meeting of the industry, where they will talk about the situation, policies, and work, using this meeting to cultivate and educate activists. After several meetings, they can propose the organization of a trade union preparatory committee. The representatives participating in the meeting serve as initiators and basic members, and then elect preparatory committee members to establish the trade union preparatory committee for the industry. The preparatory committee of the municipal federation of trade unions sends cadres to regularly provide specific assistance and guidance. All resolutions must be approved by the municipal federation of trade unions, so that there will be no problems. In the beginning, the development of members must be approved by the initiators. When there are more members, they can be divided into groups, and the development of members can be approved by the group, and the preparatory committee can approve it. When the number of members reaches more than one-third of all workers, the trade union can be formally established. When necessary, branch trade unions can be established under the trade union.

　　VII. Trade Union Funding

　　Trade union funding must be independent, and all expenses of the trade union must be covered by membership dues. At least the living expenses of trade union cadres and trade union office expenses must be completely covered by membership dues. Implement the resolution of the Sixth National Labor Congress: Trade union members pay 1% of their monthly salary as membership dues, so that the trade union's funding problem is solved. Other expenses, such as trade union cultural and educational expenses, labor insurance expenses, and running training classes, etc., are solved with the help of the government or the enterprise administration.

　　In the current transitional period, when membership dues are collected very little, the government can uniformly subsidize them. The trade union makes a budget by region, and the government of that region subsidizes it (do not rely entirely on the administration for money), gradually achieving financial independence.

　　VIII. The Tasks of the Trade Union

　　There have been various different formulations of the tasks of the trade union. The correct formulation should be: The basic task of the trade union is to protect the interests of the working class. How should the trade union perform this basic task at present?

　　(1) To unite and educate workers to support the regime led by the workers themselves, enhance the prestige of the leadership of the working class, and promote the implementation of government laws and decrees. The trade union must vigorously educate workers to understand that the regime is led by the working class itself, and that the consolidation of the New Democratic regime is the highest interest of the working class. The trade union should also send cadres to the government, which is also one of the important political tasks of the trade union.

　　(2) To lead workers to actively restore and develop production, participate in economic construction, and participate in enterprise management. The slogan "The trade union must go deep into production" put forward by the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions is completely correct. It is wrong for the trade union to not care about production, not cooperate with the administration to lead workers to actively participate in production, overcome difficulties in production, and not seek gradual improvement in workers' lives from the development of production, but only to engage in purely workers' welfare. We advocate that state-owned enterprises should quickly and comprehensively establish factory management committees to combine the forces of administration, trade unions, and worker representatives to run people's enterprises well. In private enterprises, the trade union must also cooperate with the administration to lead workers to actively produce, because the development of private capital is currently consistent with the long-term interests of the working class. Can production competitions be organized in private enterprises? We believe it is possible, because in addition to consuming a portion of the money earned by capitalists themselves, the rest is still used to expand reproduction and open more factories, which can currently solve the problem of worker unemployment.

　　(3) To protect the daily interests of workers and care about their daily needs. In state-owned factories, it is necessary to criticize the purely financial viewpoint and bureaucracy of the administration, raise the issue to the management committee for discussion, and appropriately resolve public-private relations to unleash the initiative of workers. The trade union must not commit a one-sided welfare viewpoint, and must not create antagonism with the administration. This is the most basic point. In private enterprises, in addition to protecting the daily interests of workers, the trade union must also engage in appropriate struggles with capitalists. As long as there are classes, there will be class struggle. Only with struggle can there be mutual benefit for both labor and capital. The way to struggle is to negotiate with capitalists. If it fails, request the government labor bureau to mediate and arbitrate. If it still fails, appeal to the people's court and request a court ruling.

　　To protect the daily interests of workers, the trade union must also do a very important job, which is to run worker welfare undertakings well. In the future, worker welfare undertakings should be run by the trade union. Educate and promote the spirit of unity and mutual assistance among the working class, and solve worker welfare problems with the workers' own money. This is the basic method for the trade union to solve worker welfare problems. Welfare undertakings are different from labor insurance and should not be completely funded by the state, nor should they be completely funded by the administration. It is appropriate for the administration to provide assistance.

　　(4) To strengthen the education of workers. The trade union must vigorously carry out education work for both organized workers and those who are in the process of being organized, in order to improve the political consciousness of the working class.

　　In order to accomplish the above tasks, the trade union must organize almost 100% of the workers and organize the organized workers into groups, truly live organizational lives, and make the trade union truly a powerful organization of the working class. Only in this way can the tasks of the trade union be accomplished.

　　全国工会工作会议上关于工会组织问题报告的摘要
    北平市总工会筹委会主任  萧明讲
    全总根据革命胜利的需要和少奇同志所指示的在一年左右把全国工人基本上组织起来的这一任务，在这次会议上讨论并决定了工会的组织问题。
    一、工会的名称
    现在各地工会名称不统一，有的叫工会，有的叫职工会。有人以为职工会是职员工人联合会的意思，其实职工会原来的意思是职业工会。因为在封建主义社会，工会是按行业组织的，到资本主义时期，工会仍按职业组织。十月革命以后，苏联的工会采取了按产业组织工会。按产业组织工会的好处是：在资本主义时期，一个产业一个工会，工人不易受资本家的分化，团结斗争步调一致有力。在新民主主义及社会主义时期，则有利于生产的发展，所以我们应该学习苏联按产业组织工会，并把工会的名称统一起来一律叫工会。
    二、工会的性质
    工会是工人阶级的群众性的组织，这意思可分三方面来说。
    （一）工会是工人阶级的阶级性的组织。凡是靠工资薪水为全部或大部生活来源的雇佣劳动者，不论是体力劳动者或脑力劳动者（指个人成份，不管其家庭成份如何），均属工人阶级，都可以参加工会。供给制是工资的形式之一，供给制干部当然可以参加工会，共产党是工人阶级的先锋队，党员不但要参加工会，而且要做模范会员。
    （二）工会是工人阶级广大群众性的组织。凡属于工人阶级的，不管其政治、宗教信仰如何，都可以参加工会，所以工会应将全部工人组织起来，不是只组织百分之九十，当然也不一定是百分之百（如工人中死心踏地的反动分子等即不能参加工会），而是将工人几乎百分之百的组织在工会中，所以我们应该注意，不要犯关门主义的错误。
    （三）工会是工人阶级的有组织有纪律的组织。工会会员和一般散漫的群众不同，工会会员是有组织的群众。工会会员要按工会章程办事，要服从工会的决议，要缴会费，要作工会工作。所以工会只有有了纪律，才能保证会员行动的一致。目前我们有的工会工作做得很不错，但有的犯了形式主义，会员一举手或登记一下就算入会了，不缴会费，也不作工会工作，这样的工会是没有组织没有纪律的工会，是不能起作用的。
    三、关于工会会员问题
    （一）什么人可以参加工会？凡属工人阶级者都可参加工会。新入工厂的工人可分三种类型：（甲）劳动者出身的和学生出身的，可以立刻加入工会。（乙）非劳动者出身的，须有一年以上工龄，并经群众认可，才可加入工会。（丙）剥削者压迫者出身的须有两年以上工龄，并经群众认可才可加入工会。过去是国民党、三青团及特务机关的领导分子，破坏工人利益的反动分子及压迫工人的工头等除须参加劳动两年以上，还要向群众坦白，承认错误，决心改正错误，并经群众认可，才能加入工会。
    （二）什么人不能加入工会？（甲）以剥削收入为其生活主要或大部来源者，如资本家及其代理人或把头等，以及职工中兼股东，其剥削收入占生活主要来源者，都不能加入工会。（乙）被褫夺公民权的囚犯，在刑期未满及未恢复公民权者，不得加入工会。
    （三）会员入会的手续：过去的毛病，一种是没有手续，形式主义；一种是手续太严格。会员入会应有一定的手续。即：请求、介绍、小组讨论、工会委员会批准。介绍手续是否可取消，尚可考虑；小组讨论一定要，这是经群众认可的一条。
    四、工会的民主生活
    目前我们工会工作中有种最危险的毛病，就是官办工会、命令主义、包办代替。要改变这种情况，就要在工会中实行民主。民主是工会的灵魂，工会没有民主，就成了死尸。实行工会的民主生活，要按以下三条办事。
    （一）实行全面的民主选举制度：工会干部要用民主选举办法产生，候选人要在全体大会上提出，向群众作介绍，征求附议、通过，确定候选人数，进行不记名投票选举。利用工人代表会议来培养工人中的积极分子是最好的办法。
    （二）工会的一切问题，要实行民主讨论，少数服从多数，用民主的办法来解决，千万不要少数干部强迫命令。工会也有集中，下级工会要服从上级工会。但说服群众，使群众乐于接受我们的意见，这是基本的工作方法。
    （三）实行“大家办工会”，每一个会员都要担任一样工会工作，这样不但减少了，甚至取消了脱离生产的工会干部，而且解决了工会工作的包办代替、脱离群众的毛病，并加强了工人阶级团结互助的精神。
    五、工会组织系统
    我们要根据苏联按产业组织工会的基本精神结合我们的实际情况，解决工会组织问题。少奇同志指示我们：城市中工会可分六种，即产业工会、手工业工会、店员工会、搬运工人工会、文化教育工作者工会、机关工作者工会，我们基本上执行这个指示。其中产业工会不可能只组织一个，应按产业的行政系统来建立，小的产业部门可建立产业工会联合会。
    以上六种工会，现在已有成熟条件建立全国性组织的只有：铁路、海员和邮政，这三种全国性的工会应即建立。条件已相当成熟者有：纺织、煤矿、五金和教育工作者工会。其他的条件还不够成熟。因此，目前地方性区域性的工会还是相当重要的。
    根据以上情况，我们的工会组织应有两个系统：即产业工会系统与地方工会系统。此二系统的正确关系应该是：有关产业统一性的问题归产业工会领导，如生产计划，劳动条件，工资制度等；有关地方性的问题统一归地方工会领导解决，如工资支付标准，组织纪念会等。至于日常工作，在全国性产业工会所在地以外的地方，该地的产业工会的日常工作由地方工会领导。
    六、怎样建立工会
    我们应该采取自上而下的方式建立工会，因为今天工人阶级已掌握了政权，建立工会就应采取大规模的公开的自上而下的方式。例如要建立全市性的某行业工会，则市总工会筹委会，先召集该行业的工人代表会议，在会议上讲形势，讲政策，讲工作，利用这种会议来培养教育积极分子，开过几次会，就可以提出组织工会筹委会，参加会议的代表作为发起人及基本会员，再选举筹备委员，成立该行业的工会筹委会。市总工会筹委会派干部经常具体帮助指导他们，所有决议要取得市总的同意，这样就不会出毛病。起初发展会员要经发起人通过，会员多了就可分小组，以后发展会员小组通过，筹委会批准即可。会员达到全体工人的三分之一以上，即可正式成立工会。有必要时，工会下可设分工会。
    七、工会的经费
    工会经费必须独立，必须做到工会的一切费用均由会费来开支，至少工会干部生活费和工会办公费要完全由会费开支。实行第六次劳大决议：工会会员每月缴工资百分之一为会费，这样工会的经费问题就解决了。其他如工会文教费，劳保事业费，开办训练班等费用，则由政府或企业行政方面帮助解决。
    在目前过渡时期，会费收的很少，可以统一由政府津贴，工会按区域作出预算，由该区域政府津贴（不要全靠行政拿钱），逐渐作到经费的独立。
    八、工会的任务
    工会的任务曾有过各种不同的提法，正确的提法应该是：工会的基本任务即保护工人阶级的利益。目前工会应如何执行这一基本任务呢？
    （一）要团结教育工人拥护工人自己所领导的政权，提高工人阶级领导的威信，推动政权法令的执行。工会要大力教育工人懂得政权是工人阶级自己领导的，新民主主义政权的巩固即工人阶级最高的利益。工会并应向政府输送干部，这也是工会重要政治任务之一。
    （二）要领导工人积极恢复与发展生产，参加经济建设，参加企业管理。东北总工会提出“工会要深入生产中去”的口号是完全正确的。工会不关心生产，不配合行政领导工人积极参加生产，克服生产上的困难，不从发展生产中来求得工人生活的逐步改善，只管单纯的搞工人福利是错误的。我们主张公营企业应迅速地全面的建立工厂管理委员会以结合行政、工会、工人代表的力量，办好人民企业。在私营企业中，工会也要配合行政领导工人积极生产，因为目前私人资本的发展与工人阶级长远利益是一致的。在私营企业中是否可以组织生产竞赛呢？我们认为是可以的，因为资本家挣的钱除了一部分自己消费外，其余的还是拿来扩大再生产，多开几个工厂，目前还可以解决些工人失业的问题。
    （三）要保护工人的日常利益，关心工人日常需要。在公营工厂中，要批判行政上的单纯财政观点和官僚主义，把问题提到管委会上去讨论，适当地解决公私关系，以发挥工人的积极性。工会不要犯片面的福利观点，不要和行政造成对立，这是最基本的一条。在私营企业中，工会除保护工人的日常利益外，还须与资本家作适当的斗争。有阶级存在一天，就有阶级斗争，有斗争才有劳资两利，斗争的方式是与资本家进行谈判协商，不成即请政府劳动局调解仲裁，再不成就向人民法院上诉，请求法院判决。
    要保护工人日常利益，工会还要作一项非常重要的工作，即办好工人福利事业。以后工人福利事业，应该由工会来办。教育，发扬工人阶级团结互助的精神，由工人自己出钱来办，这是工会解决工人福利问题的基本办法。福利事业与劳动保险不同，不应完全由国家出钱来办，也不应完全由行政上出钱来办，行政上给予帮助是应该的。
    （四）要加强对工人的教育工作，无论是已组织起来的工人，或正在组织过程中的工人，工会都要大力进行教育工作，以提高工人阶级的政治觉悟。
    为了完成以上的任务，工会就必须组织几乎百分之百的工人，而且要将已组织起来的工人编成小组，真正过组织生活，使工会真正成为工人阶级的强大组织。只有这样才能完成工会的任务。
