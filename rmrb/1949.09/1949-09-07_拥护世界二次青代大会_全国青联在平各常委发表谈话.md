　　【This City News】The standing committee members of the All-China Youth Federation in Beiping recently issued statements regarding the Second World Democratic Youth Congress, which opened in Hungary on September 2nd. They unanimously believe that this youth conference, including representatives from nearly eighty countries, further demonstrates the great unity of democratic youth worldwide. All the youth of China should celebrate this conference with firm confidence and boundless joy, support the convening of the conference, and endorse its resolutions.

　　Qian Sanqiang said: "Under the correct leadership of the Communist Party, the people of the Soviet Union have not only made the Soviet Union a paradise for young people, but also a bulwark of peace for the whole world. We should learn from the Soviet youth, absorb their experiences, and under the leadership of Chairman Mao, complete our stage of New Democratic national construction, and strive to enter the socialist stage. Only by working hard to transform China from an agricultural country into an industrialized one can we effectively contribute to lasting world peace, smash the aggressive conspiracies of American imperialism, and help our oppressed brothers and sisters to achieve a great turnaround."

　　Wu Han said: "We wholeheartedly celebrate the success of this grand gathering of such vast scale and historical significance; and we firmly believe that the strong unity of democratic youth worldwide will surely guarantee the victorious completion of the conference's tasks. The basis for celebration and guarantee is: First, the strength and consolidation of the democratic and peaceful camp headed by the Soviet Union, with all peace-loving and democratic people worldwide 'leaning to one side,' leaning to this side. The warmongers are completely isolated. Second, due to the fact that China's great People's Liberation War has reached the stage of basic victory, the whole country is about to be liberated, the New Political Consultative Conference is about to be convened, and the People's Republic of China is about to be established. 475 million people are supporting the strength of world democracy and peace on the side of the Soviet Union, making the democratic and peaceful camp even stronger, more consolidated, and even more invincible. Third, due to the convening of the conference, young fighters from various countries, defending democracy and peace, are gathering together to exchange experiences and learn from each other, which not only increases the confidence of inevitable success, but also greatly increases the strength of inevitable victory."

　　Shen Zhiyuan said: "The Second World Democratic Youth Congress and the World Youth and Students' Festival fully demonstrate that progressive youth around the world, under the leadership of the communist parties of various countries, and under the sacred banner of striving for lasting peace and people's democracy, have already achieved a glorious victory. Today, the international reactionary camp, headed by American imperialism, is desperately stepping up war preparations, strengthening its offensive and suppression against the people of all countries in the capitalist world, in an attempt to save or alleviate its internal contradictions and crises. But precisely because these contradictions and crises are so profound and serious, and especially because the strength of the world peace and democracy camp is so strong, the despicable attempts of the imperialist reactionary camp cannot succeed. The militant solidarity of world democratic youth is a decisive factor in causing the failure of imperialist reactionary attempts. We respectfully wish the Second World Democratic Youth Congress success! Long live the success of world people's democracy and lasting peace!"

　　Sa Kongliao said: "In 1945, our China Liberated Area Youth Federation sent representatives to the First World Democratic Youth Congress held in London, but at that time, many Chinese youth under the control of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits hardly knew about this event due to the news blockade. After only four short years, due to the great and glorious victory won by the Chinese people, Chinese youth have already held their first national congress in Beiping, and elected their own delegation to attend this second World Democratic Youth Congress in Hungary. They are already able to unite with youth from all over the world to fight for the defense of world peace and the struggle for people's democracy. For Chinese youth, this is indeed a celebratory event and exciting news. I firmly believe that after this conference, through the close contact between the Chinese youth delegation and the youth delegations of various countries, the connection between the Chinese people and the people of various countries can be strengthened. This will definitely be of great benefit to our anti-imperialist struggle and new social construction tasks."

　　Shen Tilan said: "I believe that the Chinese delegation will certainly carry forward the excellent traditions of Chinese youth, and under the banner of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, fully express the great spirit of the New Democratic revolution. I hope that this conference can further consolidate and expand the broad and strong battle line of world democracy, peace, anti-imperialism, and anti-aggression, and closely unite the Soviet Union, the New Democratic countries, and all progressive youth in other colonial, semi-colonial, and capitalist countries."

　　Li Boqiu said: "Chinese youth love their motherland, and are willing to spare no sacrifice to strive for and defend the independence and democracy of their motherland. They are equally supportive of internationalism, and are willing to forever unite with democratic youth and people all over the world, and are willing to spare no sacrifice to fight to the end for the defense of lasting world peace, and for the independence and freedom of oppressed nations. We can tell the American imperialists and their partners: if you dare to challenge peace, you will perish faster."

　　Liu Shanben said: "This demonstrates the youth's love of peace, democracy, freedom, and the noble spirit of internationalism. This marks the unprecedented unity of youth all over the world. Youth all over the world are celebrating the success of the conference and responding to and supporting the calls of the conference. Youth all over the world also deeply realize that the people have enough power to defend world peace and to smash the conspiracies and attempts of the warmongers."

　　拥护世界二次青代大会
  　全国青联在平各常委发表谈话
    【本市讯】中华全国民主青年联合总会在平各常务委员顷就九月二日在匈牙利开幕的世界民主青年第二次代表大会发表谈话。一致认为这一次包括近八十个国家的青年大会，进一步表现了世界民主青年的大团结。全中国的青年，应以坚强的信心和无限欢欣的心情来庆祝这次大会，支持大会的召开和拥护大会的决议。
    钱三强说：“苏联的人民在共产党的正确领导下，使苏联不但成为青年们的乐园，并且成了全世界的和平堡垒。我们应当向苏联青年学习，吸取他们的经验，在毛主席的领导下，完成我们新民主主义建国的阶段，为争取进入社会主义阶段而努力。只有在努力于将农业国的中国改建为工业化的中国工作中，我们才能有效地贡献于全世界的持久和平，粉碎美帝国主义的侵略阴谋及帮助被压迫的兄弟们大翻身。”
    吴晗说：“这样规模广大而具有历史意义的盛会，我们衷心庆祝它的成功；并且深信全世界民主青年的坚强团结，必然能够保证大会任务的胜利完成。庆祝和保证的根据是：第一、以苏联为首的民主和平阵营的强大和巩固，全世界爱好民主和平的人民都‘一边倒’，倒在这一边了。战争贩子们完全孤立。第二、由于中国伟大的人民解放战争已经达到了基本胜利的阶段，全国即将解放，新政治协商会议即将召开，中华人民共和国即将建立。四亿七千五百万人民拱卫世界民主和平的力量都在苏联这一边，民主和平阵营愈加强大和巩固，愈加不可战胜了。第三、由于大会的召开，各国为保卫民主、保卫和平的青年战士聚会一堂，交流经验，互相学习，不但提高了必然成功的信心，也大大增加了必然胜利的力量。”
    沈志远说：“第二次世界民主青年代表大会和世界青年与学生联欢大会，充分证明了全世界进步青年在各国共产党的领导之下，在争取持久和平与人民民主的神圣旗帜之下，业已获得了光辉的胜利。今天以美国帝国主义为首的国际反动阵营，正在拼命加紧战争准备，加强对资本主义世界各国人民的进攻与镇压，企图借此挽救或缓和它们内部的矛盾和危机。但是正由于这种矛盾和危机是这样的深刻和严重，特别由于全世界和平民主阵营的力量是如此强大，帝国主义反动阵营的卑劣企图是不可能成功的。世界民主青年的战斗团结，是促使帝国主义反动企图失败的一个有决定意义的因素。我们谨祝世界民主青年二次代表大会的成功！世界人民民主与持久和平成功万岁！”
    萨空了说：“一九四五年，我们中国解放区青年联合会曾派代表参加在伦敦举行的第一届世界民主青年代表大会，但当时在蒋匪控制下的许多中国青年，由于新闻封锁，几乎不知道有这件事。经过短短的四年，由于中国人民获得了伟大辉煌的胜利，中国青年已在北平开过了第一次全国代表大会，并推选了自己的代表团出席这次匈京的二届世界民主青年代表大会。他们已能和世界各国青年团结一起，为了保卫世界和平、争取人民民主而斗争。对中国青年，这确实是一件值得庆祝的盛事，令人兴奋的消息。我深信经过这次大会，通过中国青年代表团与世界各国青年代表团的亲密接触，一定可以加强中国人民和世界各国人民的联系。这对于我们的反帝斗争和新社会建设任务，一定都会有极大的裨益。”
    沈体兰说：“我相信中国代表团必定能发扬中国青年优秀的传统，在共产党和毛主席旗帜下面，充分表示新民主主义革命的伟大精神。希望这次大会能更加巩固和扩大世界民主和平反帝反侵略的广大而坚强的战斗战线，紧密团结苏联，新民主主义国家，其他殖民地半殖民地和资本主义国家内所有的进步青年。”
    李伯球说：“中国青年是热爱祖国的，不惜任何牺牲为争取和保卫祖国的独立与民主，同样是拥护国际主义的，愿永远与全世界民主青年，全世界人民团结在一起，不惜任何牺牲，为保卫世界持久和平，和援助被压迫民族的独立自由而奋斗到底。我们可以告诉美国帝国主义者及其伙伴们：你们如果敢于向和平挑战，你们就愈快灭亡。”
    刘善本说：“这显示着青年们爱好和平、民主、自由和崇高的国际主义精神，这标志着全世界青年的空前大团结。全世界青年在庆祝大会的成功并响应和拥护大会的号召，全世界青年也深切地体会到人民是有足够的力量来保卫世界的和平，来粉碎战争贩子们的阴谋企图的。”
