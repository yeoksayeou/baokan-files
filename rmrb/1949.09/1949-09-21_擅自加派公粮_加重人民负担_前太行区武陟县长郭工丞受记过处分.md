　　Arbitrarily Increasing the Public Grain Quota
  　Increasing the People's Burden
  　Guo Gongcheng, Former Head of Wuzhi County in the Taihang District, Receives Demerit

    [Report from this newspaper] Guo Gongcheng, the former head of Wuzhi County in the Taihang District, was given a demerit for arbitrarily increasing the public grain quota and violating policy.
    In November of last year, in order to conduct county-wide work training for a large number of intellectuals in Wuzhi County, the county head, Guo Gongcheng, instructed all district trainees to temporarily borrow wheat flour and millet from their villages, with the intention of finding ways to repay them later. When supplementing the autumn storage in January of this year, the districts raised the question of how to repay the borrowed grain. Therefore, Guo Gongcheng ordered each district to increase the public grain quota to compensate for the shortfall. However, his instructions were not specific, which led to extreme confusion during the implementation by the districts. Some districts increased the quota, some did not, and some exceeded it. For example, Zhou Hanming, the head of the Ninth District, in addition to completing the autumn storage task and increasing the grain quota for training by 61 shi, also arbitrarily increased the quota by 68 shi (and also arbitrarily allocated 30 shi within this amount to subsidize village cadres). In total, the new districts in the county over-allocated 707 shi and 5 dou to compensate for the training grain, accounting for approximately 6.7% of the total grain that should have been allocated. This kind of arbitrary increase in the public grain quota by County Head Guo Gongcheng, increasing the burden on the people, and failure to request instructions beforehand and report afterward, is a serious violation of policy and constitutes undisciplined behavior. In order to educate cadres, the North China People's Government has approved the decision by the former Taihang Administrative Office to give Guo Gongcheng, the head of Wuzhi County, a major demerit and to circulate this notice throughout the Taihang District in order to educate cadres at all levels. As for the case of Zhou Hanming, the head of the Ninth District, who over-allocated 68 shi in addition to the 61 shi allocated for training, it has been handed over to the former Taihang Administrative Office for processing.

　　擅自加派公粮
  　加重人民负担
  　前太行区武陟县长郭工丞受记过处分
    【本报讯】前太行区武陟县县长郭工丞，擅自加派公粮，违反政策，受到记过处分。
    去年十一月武陟县为了展开全县工作集训大批知识分子，县长郭工丞，指示各区的受训人员都暂从村上借贷白面、小米，以后再设法补还。这一部借粮，到今年元月补增秋屯时，各区纷纷提出如何偿还的问题，于是郭工丞就令各区增派公粮弥补解决。但指示又不具体，致各区执行时极为混乱，有的增派了，有的没增派，有的则超过了。如九区区长周汉明除完成秋屯任务和加派集训用粮六十一石外，又私自加派了六十八石（并在此数内擅自支拨三十石救济村干部）。总计此次全县新区为了弥补集训用粮，共多派了七百零七石五斗，约占应派粮总额的百分之六·七强。该县县长郭工丞此种擅自加派公粮，加重人民负担，事前不请示，事后不报告，是严重的违反政策，无组织无纪律行为。为了教育干部，华北人民政府已批准由前太行行署，给武陟县县长郭工丞以记大过一次处分，并通告太行全区，以教育各级干部。到于该县九区区长周汉明，于加派六十一石集训用粮之外，又超派了六十八石一节，则已交前太行行署处理。　（华新室）
