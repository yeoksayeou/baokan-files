Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, September 9th: The Tianjin All-Circles Representatives Conference, lasting four days, victoriously concluded on the 8th. The conference heard the report by Huang Jing, Director of the Tianjin Military Control Commission and Mayor, on the municipal work after liberation and future policy directions, and unanimously approved it after discussion. The conference put forward three suggestions regarding Tianjin's future municipal construction: (1) Regarding streamlining and economy: In order to support the Liberation War and vigorously develop production, we should learn from the Soviet Union's spirit of construction and use every penny for construction. Therefore, administrative expenses and entertainment expenses should be reduced; construction expenses should be increased; employees and public educators should be encouraged to voluntarily and appropriately reduce their wages; public and private enterprises and organizations should launch planned streamlining and economy campaigns; and all citizens should universally practice economy. (2) Regarding the economy: Implement planned production to prevent capital losses and unsalable finished products, which would affect the entire production; at the same time, attention should be paid to promoting exports; public and private institutions should closely coordinate production and sales. (3) Regarding cultural and educational undertakings: Increase funding for primary and secondary education and expand social education work based on the development of production and the government's economic capabilities. In order to strengthen the connection between the government and the people, the conference passed a resolution to establish the Tianjin All-Circles Consultative Committee as a permanent organ of the conference, and elected Huang Jing, Li Zhuchen, Yang Shixian, Zhou Shutao, and 15 others as members of the Consultative Committee.

Another significant achievement of the conference was the formulation and adoption of the "Provisional Measures for Handling Labor-Capital Relations" in Tianjin. The representatives seriously and responsibly discussed and debated these measures, made important revisions to the draft proposed by the Military Control Commission, and finally unanimously approved them.

The conference received more than 300 proposals and more than 60 temporary proposals. The conference divided them into categories for group or plenary discussions and dealt with them appropriately. The conference resolved to establish: 1. Urban Construction Research Committee; 2. Taxation Research Committee; 3. Enterprise Investment Research Committee; 4. Transportation Technology and Wage Issues Research Association; 5. Tianjin Area Flood Relief Committee; 6. Committee for Evacuating Non-Productive Population; 7. Employee Health Investigation and Research Committee. These specialized committees will maintain close contact with the Military Control Commission and the Municipal Government, participate in the research and decision-making of various issues, and jointly promote the construction of the new Tianjin. In addition, the meeting also passed a proposal to establish the Tianjin Branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and elected 87 preparatory committee members.

Finally, the Tianjin All-Circles Representatives Conference passed a telegram of respect to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, a telegram to the Preparatory Committee of the New Political Consultative Conference, a telegram to all commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army, and a letter to compatriots across the country exposing the US imperialist White Paper conspiracy. In addition, the Hui Muslim delegation also sent a telegram of respect to the People's Liberation Army liberating the Northwest and a message of comfort to the Hui Muslims in the newly liberated areas of the Northwest.

　　天津各界代表会闭幕
    一致通过黄敬市长施政方针报告选出各界协商委员会为常设机关
    【新华社天津九日电】天津市各界代表会议，历时四天，已于八日胜利闭幕。大会听取了天津市军管会主任兼市长黄敬关于解放后的市政工作及今后施政方针的报告，并经讨论后一致通过。大会对天津今后的市政建设提出三项建议：（一）关于精简节约方面：为支援解放战争，大力发展生产事业，应该学习苏联的建设精神，把每一文钱都用在建设事业上。因此应减少行政费，招待费；增加建设费；鼓励职工、公教人员应自动适当地自动地减低工薪；公私营企业团体应有计划地展开精简节约运动；全体市民也应普遍厉行节约。（二）关于经济方面：实行有计划的生产，以防止资金耗损，成品滞销，影响整个生产；同时应注意推广输出；公私营机构对产销更应密切配合。（三）关于文教事业：根据生产发展和政府经济可能的条件，增加中、小学教育经费及扩展社教工作。为了加强政府与人民的联系，大会通过成立天津各界协商委员会，作为大会的常设机构，选出黄敬、李烛尘、杨石先、周叔韬等十九人为协商委员会的委员。
    大会的另一重大收获，是制定并通过了天津市“劳资关系暂行处理办法”。这办法曾经各代表严肃负责地进行了讨论和争辩，对军管会提出的草案做了重要修正，最后全体一致通过。
    大会共收到三百多件提案和六十多件临时提案，会议都分门别类地进行了分组或大会的讨论，作了适当处理。大会决议成立：一、都市建设研究委员会，二、税收研究委员会，三、企业投资研究委员会，四、运输技术、工资问题研究会，五、天津附近地区水灾救济委员会，六、疏散非生产人口委员会，七、职工卫生调查研究委员会。这些专门委员会，将与军管会和市政府经常保持密切联系，参加各种问题的研究和决定，以共同推进新天津的建设工作。此外，会上并通过了成立中苏友好协会天津分会的提案，选出八十七人为筹备委员。
    最后，天津各界代表会议通过向毛主席、朱总司令致敬电，致新政治协商会议筹备会电，致人民解放军全体指战员电，以及为揭穿美帝白皮书阴谋的告全国同胞书。此外，回民代表团并致电解放西北的人民解放军致敬，及向西北新解放区的回民致慰。
