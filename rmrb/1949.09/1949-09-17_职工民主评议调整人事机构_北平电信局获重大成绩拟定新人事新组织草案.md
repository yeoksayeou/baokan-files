Employee Democratic Appraisal Adjusts Personnel Structure
    Beiping Telecommunications Bureau Achieves Significant Results, Drafts New Personnel and Organizational Plan

[This City News] After the Beiping Telecommunications Bureau's Enterprise Management Committee launched a democratic appraisal and personnel adjustment campaign in early July, it has achieved great results after more than two months. Under the guidance of improving production efficiency and rationalizing the organization, employees of all units of the bureau used democratic appraisal methods to adjust and reform the old, unreasonable organization and personnel. At present, the democratic appraisal work has largely concluded. Most units have submitted drafts of new organizational structures and personnel arrangements for their respective departments, which will be announced after the Enterprise Management Committee convenes a meeting to study and discuss them. Through this democratic appraisal campaign, employees have further raised their class consciousness and deeply realized that the factory is their own and they should be the masters. As a result, production enthusiasm has increased and work has become more active.

The launch of this movement was carried out under the collective leadership and mutual cooperation of the Party, government, labor union, Youth League, and Enterprise Management Committee members. Starting in mid-June, publicity and preparatory work were carried out individually in the Third Bureau, Second Bureau, Seventh Bureau, Fifth Bureau, Fourth Bureau, Line Engineering Brigade, and Dongchangan Street Business Office. The labor union called on small groups to conduct study and discussions, enabling employees to initially understand "Why is democratic management necessary?" "Why is it necessary to streamline the organization and reform personnel?" "Why should criticism and self-criticism be used in the appraisal?" After studying and discussing, the appraisal began in July. According to different situations, each unit generally had employees fill out employee opinion survey forms to conduct a "public opinion poll," and then discussed organizational forms, work content, and staffing. The nomination of responsible persons was done through public nomination and self-nomination, and criticism and self-criticism were carried out during the appraisal process. There were two types of appraisal methods: one was led by the administration in coordination with labor union group leaders (such as the Traffic Section, Long-Distance Station, Seventh Bureau, etc.), and the other was led by an elected presidium (such as the general affairs office and units under the engineering office). The Line Section's method was the most complete, using a combination of democratic testing, joint meetings of the Party, government, labor union, and Youth League, and a presidium to conduct the meetings. The good leadership of the meetings laid the foundation for the democratic appraisal and reorganization movement.

　　　　Eliminating Cumbersome Organizations, Improving Work Efficiency
The biggest achievement of the meetings was the study and discussion of streamlining the organization. All units conducted appraisals in the spirit of streamlining and unanimously agreed that it was necessary to adjust, improve, or abolish unnecessary old organizational structures and personnel. For example, the Line Section decided to change the original design, allocation, and construction teams, which were divided according to work nature, into three teams responsible for work in different areas. This solved unnecessary procedures for workers, saved manpower and material resources, and improved production efficiency. The Traffic Section decided to abolish the section chief level. The Seventh Bureau's exchange reduced the number of deputy team leaders (originally seven or eight, reduced to two), and the accounting section was reduced to 29 people, six fewer than before. In this way, all empty organizational structures were eliminated, and business procedures were simplified.

In the appraisal and reorganization movement, the extensive discussion of organizational forms enabled employees to further understand the overall organization and put forward many reform opinions. All units carefully nominated the responsible persons of their units based on the three criteria of "talent, morality, and qualifications," and everyone criticized each other in a kind and helpful manner. Everyone reviewed themselves, which not only promoted the appraisal work but also improved unity. For example, Wang Shihua of the Line Section had good technology but was a bit arrogant and did not connect well with the masses. Everyone had opinions about him, and after self-examination, he changed his style. Wei Hongxian, the chief of the accounting section, reviewed his public-private abuses during the Kuomintang rule, and others also began to review themselves. Several non-members of the Line Section who had not been approved for membership in the labor union, such as Huang @, requested to review their past mistakes in front of the masses and asked everyone to criticize them. These proved that employees had a new understanding of criticism and self-criticism, and at the same time, enabled the appraisal movement to proceed smoothly.

In addition, this movement helped the administration understand the old supervisors and active members of the masses and appropriately allocated work according to the abilities of each employee. The eyes of the masses are sharp. Although some pretended to be active, they were exposed after everyone's criticism. Many people who had been corrupt and oppressed workers in the past had their crimes listed by the masses, forcing them to bow their heads to the masses and not dare to do bad things under the supervision of the masses. There were also some people who were very active in their work and had good character but were suppressed during the Kuomintang rule because they did not give gifts to their "superiors," and others who could not rise because of so-called "qualifications." This time, they were able to rise. For example, the Line Section did not distinguish between qualifications, and those who were competent were nominated as team leaders and squad leaders.

After this democratic appraisal and reorganization movement, most employees changed their work attitude, and both production and learning became very active. Wang Shihua of the line workers said: "In the past, I didn't have any energy even when I was eating rice and white flour. Today, I guarantee that I can finish the work of the past five days in three days." The employees of the Seventh Bureau's exchange were more serious and responsible in their work than before, rushing to do work and sweeping away the past attitude of procrastination and irresponsibility. The employees of the Third Bureau's long-distance station all said: "Now it is really different from the past. Our supervisors are elected after everyone's discussion, and we dare to criticize boldly if we have any opinions. We really have to work hard. The bureau is our home, and we are the masters of the bureau."

　　职工民主评议调整人事机构
    北平电信局获重大成绩拟定新人事新组织草案
    【本市讯】北平电信局企业管理委员会于七月初展开民主评议人事调整运动之后，经过两个多月的时间，已获得了很大的成绩。全局所属各单位的职工，在提高生产效率和机构合理化的方针下，用民主评议的方法，调整改革了旧有的不合理的组织和人事，到目前，民主评议工作已大致结束，各单位大部分都提出了本部门的新组织、新人事的草案，待企管会开会研究讨论后，即可宣布。职工们经过这次民主评议运动，更提高了阶级觉悟，深刻地认识到了工厂就是自己的，应该自己当家做主；这样，生产情绪提高了，工作更积极起来。
    这个运动的展开，是在党、政、工、团及企管会委员集体领导与互相配合下进行的，由六月中旬开始，在三局、二局、七局、五局、四局、线路工程大队及东长安街营业处等单位，先后个别的展开了宣传和酝酿工作，由工会号召，在小组进行学习讨论，使职工们初步认识了“为什么要民主管理”？“为什么要精简机构与改革人事”？“为什么要用批评和自我批评的方式进行评议”？经过学习讨论后，于七月间开始评议。各单位根据不同情况，一般先让职工们填写职工意见调查表，进行一次“民意测验”后，即讨论组织形式和工作内容以及人员编制。主管人员的提出，是用大家提名与自报公议的办法，在评议过程中，展开批评和自我批评。评议方式有两种，一种是由行政配合工会小组长来领导会议（如话务科、长途台、七局等单位），一种是选出主席团来领导会议（如局务处与工务处所属各单位），线路科的方式比较最完善，是通过民主测验，党、政、工、团联席会，主席团三种形式来配合进行会议，由于会议领导的好，奠定了民主评议改组运动的基础。
    　　　　取消繁复机构　工作效率提高
    会议中最大的成就，便是研究讨论了精简机构的问题，各单位都本着精简的精神评议，一致认为：必需调整、改善或撤销不必要的旧有组织机构及人事。如：线路科决议将原来按工作性质划分的设计、配备、施工三个工作队，改为分区负责工作的三个队，便解决了工友们在工作上不必要的手续，节省人力、物力，使生产效率提高；话务科决议取销了股长一级；七局交换室将副领班减少（原来是七、八人，减为二人），会计科缩编为二十九人，比原来少了六人。这样，使所有搭着空架子的组织机构取消了，业务手续简化了。
    在评议改组运动中，由于广泛地讨论了组织形式，使职工们对全局的组织有了进一步的认识，更提出了很多改革的意见。各单位都根据“才、德、资”三个条件，慎重的提出本单位的主管人；并且大家抱着与人为善的态度相互进行批评，每个人检讨了自己，这样不但使评议工作向前推进一步，也搞好了团结。如线路科王世华的技术较好，就是有点自高自大，联系群众不好，大家对他有意见，经过自我检讨以后，改变了作风。会计科科长魏洪贤将国民党统治时期假公济私的事情检讨出来后，其他的人也都自己检讨起来，线路科有几个未被审查合格入工会的非会员黄＠等，要求在群众面前检讨以前的过错，并请求大家批评。这些，证明职工们对批评、自我批评有了新的认识；同时，也使评议运动能够顺利地进行。
    另外，在这个运动过程中，帮助行政了解旧有主管及群众中的积极分子，并按照各个职工的能力，适当地分配了工作。群众的眼睛是亮的，虽然有的假装着积极，经过大家的批评，也暴露出来了；很多过去贪污压迫工人的人，群众都把他们的罪恶罗列出来，使得他们向群众低头，在群众监视之下，不敢再做坏事；又有一些工作很积极，品行很好的人，在国民党统治时期，因为不给“上司”送礼而受压迫；又有因为所谓“资格”的限制不能抬头的人，这次也得以抬起头来，如：线路科不分什么资格，能胜任的便被提名为领班、班长。
    经过这次民主评议改组运动后，大多数职工改变了劳动态度，生产、学习都很积极。线工王世华说：“过去吃着大米、白面干着都没劲儿，今天，我保证能把过去五天的活儿三天干完。”七局交换室的职工，在工作上都比以前认真负责，抢工作干，一扫过去拖延不负责的态度。三局长途台职工都纷纷说：“现在和过去真是大不相同了，咱们的主管人都要经过大家讨论才选出来，有意见，也敢大胆批评，我们真得好好干，局子就是我们的家，我们就是局子的主人。”
