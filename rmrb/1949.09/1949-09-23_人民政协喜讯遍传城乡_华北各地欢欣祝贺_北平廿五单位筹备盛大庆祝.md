[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] The opening of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) has triggered enthusiastic celebrations among the broad masses of people in various parts of North China. Twenty-five units in Beiping City, including various government agencies, democratic parties, and people's organizations, convened on the 20th to prepare for celebrations for the establishment of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China. The meeting decided to hold a celebration rally, military parade, and mass demonstration parade on the day the Central People's Government is established, and a lantern parade on the same evening. Representatives of the Tianjin Municipal People's Representative Conference unanimously stated that they would better build and prosper Tianjin, the industrial and commercial center of North China, in the spirit of self-reliance and hard work. Wang Lin, head of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, said: The Federation of Trade Unions has decided to convey the voice of the CPPCC to every worker. Yang Yizhou, General Manager of the state-owned industrial representative China Textile Company, said: The convening of the CPPCC is something that all employees of China Textile have long hoped for, and all employees are determined to improve production quality to welcome it.

Zhu Jisheng, General Manager of the private industrial representative Renli Enterprise Woolen Company, felt that this CPPCC had representatives from various parties, organizations, localities, and ethnic groups participating, truly representing the will of the 475 million people of the country, and was completely different from the National Assembly conference monopolized by the Kuomintang reactionaries. He hoped that after the establishment of the Central People's Government, unified regulations would be made on labor-capital relations and tax policies, and a unified three-year or five-year plan should be made for industrial construction. Liu @qi, an engineer representative from the Ji'an Waterworks Company, said: In the past, the Kuomintang destroyed technical talents. Today, the People's Government cherishes technical talents. It is believed that after the establishment of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, our engineers will surely have better opportunities to serve the economic construction of the motherland. Luo Yun of the Tianjin Democratic Women's Federation delivered a speech on the opening of the CPPCC, saying: While celebrating the opening of the CPPCC, women compatriots should work hard to build our new Tianjin and wait quietly for the page in the People's Constitution that guarantees women's rights and status.
