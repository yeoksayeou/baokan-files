　　Jicha banknotes have lost their circulation validity
  　The People's Bank of Ping is actively recovering them
    [Report from this newspaper] The People's Bank of Ping Branch is cooperating with various public and cooperative enterprises and financial and tax authorities to strengthen the recovery of Jinnan Bank banknotes. The Jinnan Bank banknotes circulating in Beiping were originally intended to supplement the shortage of small denominations of the local currency and to promote the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas at that time. Later, as the small denomination chips of the local currency were sufficient for application, and the denomination of the Jicha banknotes was relatively small, they gradually lost their circulation validity in urban and rural transactions. In order to enhance the credit of the local currency, the bank, in addition to continuing the recovery work by its subordinate departments, and no longer paying out the recovered Jicha banknotes, also sent letters to various state-owned enterprises, cooperative undertakings, and financial and tax authorities in the city to cooperate in the process. The Jicha banknotes received by various units can be delivered to the bank when conducting business with the bank, or directly exchanged with the bank's subordinate departments.

　　冀钞已失流通时效
  　平人民银行正积极收回
    【本报讯】人民银行北平分行配合各公营、合作事业及财政税收机关加强收回冀南银行钞票工作。在北平流通之冀南银行钞票，原为补助本币发行小票不足暨促使当时城乡物资交流之需，嗣以本币小额筹码已敷应用，复加冀钞票额较小，在城乡交易中已渐失流通之时效，该行为增强本币信用，除由所属各部处继续进行收回工作，对已回笼冀钞不再付出外，并函请本市各国公营企业、合作事业及财政税政机关等协同进行，各单位已收进之冀钞可于通过与该行往来业务时交付该行或径向该行所属部处进行兑换。
