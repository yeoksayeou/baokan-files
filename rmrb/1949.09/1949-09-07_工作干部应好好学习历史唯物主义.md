Working Cadres Should Study Historical Materialism Well
    Hua Ming

    The People's Daily published an article by Comrade Dai Xinmin on September 1st: "Ideological Problems to be Solved in Realizing Democratic Factory Management." The article provided some very good ideological materials and gave very good analyses, pointing out that the difficulty in realizing democratic factory management is due to the fact that some comrades "can't figure it out," and therefore have many concerns about implementing democratic factory management. It also analyzed the ideological roots of their concerns, saying: "The basic problem is that the idea of relying on the proletariat is too vague, and the understanding of the mass line is too poor." These analyses are very good. But I feel that just pointing this out is not enough; it has not been raised to the proper ideological height. Because, we can further ask: Why are they "too vague in their idea of relying on the proletariat, and too poor in their understanding of the mass line"? In addition to their class origin, the more fundamental reason is that their thinking has not been tempered by Marxism-Leninism, and they still lack historical materialism. Their view of the people is a strong historical idealist view, not a historical materialist view, not a Mao Zedong Thought view.

    Since we entered Tianjin and Beijing, transforming the thinking of intellectuals, staff, and workers in the new areas has become an urgent task. The central government instructed us to carry out large-scale historical materialism education, publicize the ideas of "labor creates the world," "the working people create history," and "the working people are the masters of history." Tens of thousands of people inside and outside the Party participated in this study movement, and it did achieve great results in ideological transformation, in overcoming the view of despising the working people, and in establishing a historical materialist people's viewpoint. However, some of our cadres working in factories, since they were very unfamiliar with historical materialism in the past, and now are too busy with takeover work to participate in this great study movement, and some may even have a view of despising theoretical study, thinking that learning those things in books is of no use to practical work. Little do they know that when they lead a factory, they are unwilling to rely on the working class, unwilling to listen to the opinions of workers, distrust the masses, do not follow the mass line, and do not consult with the masses when something happens, precisely because they lack basic knowledge of Marxist-Leninist theory, do not understand the historical materialist people's viewpoint, and cannot use Marxist-Leninist historical materialism to guide practical work.

    Chairman Mao tells us: "As long as we can grasp the science of Marxism-Leninism, trust the masses, closely unite with the masses, and lead them forward, we are fully capable of overcoming any difficulties, and our strength is invincible." Some of our cadres, however, are unable to grasp the science of Marxism-Leninism and do not trust the masses. However, these two are consistent; those who can grasp the science of Marxism-Leninism will definitely be able to trust the masses, and their distrust of the masses is precisely because they cannot grasp the science of Marxism-Leninism.

    There are two views of history: one is the idealist view of history, which believes that spirit (or God) creates the world, heroes create history, and heroes are the masters of history. As Liang Qichao said: "The biggest question at the beginning of the cause and effect of history is whether heroes create the times, or the times create heroes? In other words, is it true that 'history is the product of a few great figures,' 'heroes are history'? Russell said: 'If you try to remove more than a dozen people from a world history, I am afraid the situation will change completely,' this sentence we can not but recognize that it contains a part of the truth." This is a typical idealist view of history. One is the materialist view of history, which believes that labor creates the world, the working people create history, and the working people are the main body of history. It believes that it is not heroes who create history, but history that creates heroes, that is, it is not heroes who create the people, but the people who create heroes and promote history.

    Stalin said: "The period when leaders were previously regarded as the sole creators of history, without counting workers and peasants, has passed. The destiny of nations and countries is now determined not only by leaders. Workers and peasants silently build factories and manufacture plants, creating all the wealth of life to supply the whole world, they are the real heroes and creators of new life."

    "The history of social development is first and foremost the history of production development, and at the same time, it is also the history of the producers themselves, that is, the history of the working people."

    "If historical science wants to become a real science, it can no longer reduce the history of social development to the actions of emperors, generals, and ministers, to the actions of aggressors and conquerors, but should first study the history of material producers, the history of the working masses, and the history of the people of all countries."

    There are two kinds of people's viewpoints: one is the viewpoint of the historically reactionary ruling class towards the people, believing that the people are ignorant, backward, passive, and are born slaves and beasts, who should be treated with whips. They insult the people who resist the reactionary ruling class as bandits and rebels, and pile all the filthy words on the people. In recent times, bourgeois revolutionaries have made progress in their view of the people, no longer regarding the people as slaves, but recognizing that the people are the masters, but they also believe that this master is a dim-witted crown prince, incompetent and incompetent, and must have a Zhuge Liang to escort him. One is the historical materialist view of the people, which believes that the people have great wisdom and infinite creativity. Chairman Mao's view of the people is a truly Marxist-Leninist historical materialist view, for example, he said:

    "The people, only the people, are the motive force for creating world history."

    "The masses are the real heroes."

    "The creativity of the masses of the people is inexhaustible."

    "Three cobblers make a Zhuge Liang, which means that the masses have great creativity. Among the Chinese people, there are tens of thousands of Zhuge Liangs, and every village and every town has its own Zhuge Liang."

    Chairman Mao believed that there are tens of thousands of Zhuge Liangs among the masses, and the masses themselves are Zhuge Liang, and there is no need to find Zhuge Liang for the masses outside the masses.

    Chairman Mao earnestly admonished us: "Every comrade should understand that as long as we rely on the people, firmly believe that the creativity of the masses of the people is inexhaustible, and therefore trust the people and unite with the people, then any difficulty can be overcome, and no enemy can overwhelm us, but will only be overwhelmed by us."

    Are there backward phenomena among the masses? There are backward phenomena. But how should we understand these backward phenomena? The backward phenomena of the masses are by no means the innate essence of the masses, and it is not that the masses are born backward. Confucius once said: "Only the highest wisdom and the lowest stupidity are unchangeable," this is a metaphysical point of view, which is completely wrong. The backward phenomena of the masses are the result of the long-term policy of fooling the people and the cruel exploitation and oppression of the reactionary ruling class. They are afraid that the people will become smart and endanger their rule, so they try every means to block the people's minds, and at the same time exploit the people so much that they do not have time to seek survival, and there is no opportunity to learn culture at all. As Chairman Mao said: "Despotism is conducive to the ignorance of the people." Under the autocratic emperors and the imperialist feudal fascist rule in the past, I don't know how many geniuses, talents and wisdom among the people have been ravaged, destroyed and buried! Therefore, Chairman Mao said: "National oppression and feudal oppression cruelly bind the development of the individuality of the Chinese people." As long as you have a little bit of historical materialism, you should look at the backward phenomena of the masses in this way, which is correct. Once the masses are liberated economically, politically, and ideologically, once the shackles of the development of individuality are lifted, and once class consciousness is enlightened and raised, their creativity and wisdom will have the opportunity to be exerted and developed. This has been confirmed by the working class and laboring people of the Soviet Union, the working class and laboring people of the new democratic countries in Eastern Europe, and the working class and laboring people of the liberated areas of China. Are the workers and peasants after the October Revolution in the Soviet Union not the workers and peasants under the rule of the Tsar not long ago? It is still these workers and peasants who, after the October Revolution, were able to create a brilliant and unprecedented socialist republic. Are the workers and peasants in our liberated areas today not the workers and peasants of the old China not long ago? But isn't the great victory of the People's Liberation War their great creation? Aren't the many creations and inventions in various factories in the liberated areas the achievements of these workers?

    Let's look at the attitudes of some of our factory cadres towards the workers reflected in Comrade Dai Xinmin's article, and see what their views on the workers are.

    They believe: "Workers who are not well educated are only selfish..."

    They believe: "Without slamming the table, without losing your temper, without punishment... discipline is difficult to maintain..."

    They believe: "How many complete opinions can workers put forward? At most, they can put forward some scattered things..."

    They believe that emphasizing reliance on the workers and masses "is not conducive to the unity of employees."

    They demand "leniency towards employees and strictness towards workers."

    When they see some backward performance of workers, they "deeply hate and resent" them, "get angry and slam the table, scold them... and even fire them."

    They even said: "I am not from the working class myself, and I 'praise' the working class like this!... I am a cadre, an employee, and I am so demanding of cadres and employees!"

    "They ideologically oppose themselves to the working class, and oppose employees to the working class."

    "They do not regard workers as masters."

    When a cadre mobilized workers to study, he said: "Study hard, otherwise, what's the use of being a worker for the rest of your life!"

    These are completely serious anti-historical materialist thoughts and emotions. They despise labor, despise workers, and lack sympathy for workers. They pride themselves on not being from the working class, and their attitude and feelings towards the working class are the attitude and feelings of the bourgeoisie. They are very arrogant, not serving as servants to the working class, but serving as superiors to the working class. With such attitudes, feelings, thoughts and emotions, how can they approach workers, look up to workers, pay attention to listening to workers' opinions, and even believe in workers, rely on the working class, let go of democracy, and implement democratic factory management? Of course it is impossible. If these comrades had read historical materialism books in the past, they would have only studied them dogmatically, and did not transform their own thinking based on historical materialism, establish a correct people's viewpoint, and would not have combined this universal truth of Marxism with concrete practical work. They don't even understand that Chairman Mao is the most adept at using historical materialism to guide the Chinese revolution, and the historical materialist thought, like a red thread, runs through all of Chairman Mao's works. It is precisely because these comrades lack historical materialist thought that they do not have a correct view of workers, do not have a correct understanding of some backward phenomena of workers, and therefore they dare not believe in workers, dare not rely on the working class, dare not let go of democracy, dare not consult with the masses when something happens, and dare not follow the mass line. I think this is the more fundamental ideological root cause that hinders the realization of democratic factory management. Of course, this is also related to their class origin.

    Because they lack historical materialist thought, they do not understand that the leadership method of our Party, which comes from the masses and goes to the masses, concentrates and persists, also embodies historical materialist thought. They do not understand what "three cobblers make a Zhuge Liang" means, and therefore blame the workers for "not being able to think of complete opinions, and at most put forward some scattered things"; they do not understand that the so-called "concentration" means that the leaders should turn the scattered, fragmented, and unsystematic opinions of the masses into systematic and concentrated opinions through research, and then persist in them. They do not understand that Chairman Mao has long told us: "Revolutionary politicians, politicians who understand the revolutionary political science or political art, they are only the leaders of tens of millions of mass politicians, their task is to concentrate the opinions of the mass politicians, refine them, and then return them to the masses, for the masses to understand and practice, not to build cars behind closed doors, to be clever, only this one family, no other branch of the so-called aristocratic politicians - this is the fundamental difference between proletarian politicians and propertied class politicians, and also the fundamental difference between proletarian politics and propertied class politics."

    From this, it can be seen that those who lack historical materialist thought and lack the historical materialist people's viewpoint cannot implement our Party's historical materialist leadership method, and therefore cannot follow the mass line.

    Some of our comrades still do not understand the difference between two styles: that is, the style of closely contacting the masses, the style of consulting with the masses when something happens, and the style of the mass line. This is the historical materialist style and the style that the Communist Party should have. The other is the style of coercion and command, taking everything into one's own hands, bureaucratic style, and the style of being divorced from the masses. This is the anti-historical materialist style and the style of the Kuomintang. Style is not a simple matter of attitude, a technical problem, but a problem of thought. Style is the manifestation of the essence of thought.

    Why is it said that coercion and command, taking everything into one's own hands, and bureaucracy are the style of the Kuomintang? Because the Kuomintang represents the interests of the landlords and the bourgeoisie, and all their policies and laws are formulated from the interests of the landlords and the bourgeoisie, which are completely opposed to the interests of the people, so they must coerce and command and enforce their policies and laws. Moreover, they regard the masses as slaves and beasts, and naturally think that it is not enough to beat and scold them. Secondly, since they believe that the masses are the crown prince, who have power but no ability, they must act as Zhuge Liang for the masses, which also comes from the anti-historical materialist people's viewpoint, which is a typical idea of taking everything into one's own hands. Our Communist Party represents the interests of the proletariat and the laboring people, and all our policies and laws are formulated from the interests of the proletariat and the laboring people, which are completely in line with the interests of the proletariat and the laboring people, so as long as the truth is made clear to the masses and the class consciousness of the masses is enlightened, the masses will consciously and voluntarily implement them. Therefore, we only need to use the method of persuasion and education, and there is no need for coercion and command at all. Secondly, we believe that the masses have great wisdom and infinite creativity, this master is a master with power and ability, and there are tens of thousands of Zhuge Liangs among the masses, as long as the consciousness of the masses is enlightened, the masses will act on their own. The liberation of the masses is the cause of the masses themselves, and this revolutionary principle comes from this idea. Therefore, we also fundamentally oppose the style of taking everything into one's own hands. Our style comes from our historical materialist people's viewpoint.

    Our Party Constitution stipulates in the general program: "The Communist Party of China takes Marxist-Leninist dialectical materialism and historical materialism as its foundation." Therefore, I hope that all our working cadres will study historical materialism well, use historical materialism to transform their non-historical materialism and even anti-historical materialism, and learn to implement historical materialism in all our practical work and daily life. It must be known that a Communist Party cadre, if he does not have the historical materialist people's viewpoint, cannot stand firmly on the proletarian position, cannot completely overcome individual heroism, cannot completely overcome the style of coercion and command, taking everything into one's own hands, and bureaucracy, and cannot establish the style of closely contacting the masses, consulting with the masses when something happens, and the mass line. Without the historical materialist people's viewpoint, we cannot establish the confidence of trusting the masses and relying on the masses, and we cannot implement the political line of relying on the working class wholeheartedly, and we cannot implement the leadership method of coming from the masses and going to the masses.

　　工作干部应好好学习历史唯物主义
    华明
    九月一日人民日报登载了戴新民同志的一篇文章：“实现工厂管理民主化要解决的思想问题”，文章中提供了一些很好的思想材料，并给予了很好的分析，指出工厂管理民主化之难以实现，是由于有些同志“想不通”，因而对施行工厂管理民主化抱着很多顾虑。又分析了他们顾虑的思想根源，说：“基本问题是依靠无产阶级的思想太模糊，对群众路线了解太差”。这些分析都是很好的。但我觉得光这样指出，还很不够，还未提到应有的思想高度。因为，还可更进一步追问一下：为什么他们“依靠无产阶级的思想太模糊，对群众路线了解太差”呢？这除了由于他们的阶级出身关系以外，更基本的，乃是由于他们的思想未受过马列主义的锻炼，还太缺乏历史唯物主义思想。他们对于人民群众的观点，乃是浓厚的历史唯心主义的观点，而不是历史唯物主义的观点，不是毛泽东思想的观点。
    自从我们进入平津以后，改造新区知识分子、职员、工人的思想，成为当前的迫切任务，中央指示要大规模地进行历史唯物主义的教育，宣传“劳动创造世界”，“劳动人民创造历史，“劳动人民是历史主人”的思想，党内党外参加这一学习运动的人是成千成万的，在思想改造上，在克服轻视劳动人民的观点上，在确立历史唯物主义的人民观点上，确实收了很大效果。可是我们有些在工厂中工作的干部，他们过去对于历史唯物主义思想既然很生疏，此次又因忙于接管工作，顾不上参加这个伟大的学习运动，有些人或者还有轻视理论学习的观点，以为学习那些书本上的东西，对实际工作没有什么用处。殊不知他们在领导一个工厂的时候，不肯依靠工人阶级，不肯听取工人意见，不相信群众，不走群众路线，有事不与群众商量等等，恰恰就是因为他们缺乏马列主义基本理论知识，不懂得历史唯物主义的人民观点，不能拿马列主义的历史唯物主义思想来指导实际工作的原故。
    毛主席告诉我们：“只要我们能够掌握马克思列宁主义的科学，信任群众，紧紧地和群众一道，并领导他们前进，我们是完全能够超越任何困难的，我们的力量是无敌的。”我们有些干部却是：既不能掌握马克思列宁主义的科学，又不信任群众。然此二者本是一致的，能掌握马克思列宁主义的科学，便一定能信任群众，其不信任群众，正是由于他们不能掌握马克思列宁主义的科学。
    有两种历史观：一种是唯心主义的历史观，认为精神（或上帝）创造世界，英雄创造历史，英雄是历史的主人。如梁启超所说：“史界因果之劈头一大问题，则英雄造时势耶？时势造英雄耶？换言之，则所谓‘历史为少数伟大人物之产儿’，‘英雄即历史’者，其说然耶，否耶？罗素言：‘一部世界史，试将其中十余人抽去，恐局面或将全变’，此语吾侪不能不认为确含一部分真理”。这是一种典型的唯心主义的历史观。一种是唯物主义的历史观，认为劳动创造世界，劳动人民创造历史，劳动人民是历史的主体。认为并不是英雄创造历史，而是历史创造英雄，也就是说，不是英雄创造人民，而是人民创造英雄并推进历史。
    斯大林说：“从前曾将领袖认为是历史唯一的创造者，而不把工人和农民计算在内，这个时期已经过去了。民族和国家的命运，现在不仅仅是由领袖来决定。工人和农民不声不响地在建设工厂和制造厂，创造生活的一切财富，以之供给全世界，他们才是真正的英雄和新生活的创造者。”
    “社会发展史，首先就是生产发展史，同时也就是生产者本身的历史，就是劳动人民的历史。”
    “历史科学，如果它想成为真正的科学，就不能再把社会发展史归结为帝王将相的行动，归结为侵略者和征服者的行动，而是应当首先研究物质资料生产者的历史，劳动群众的历史，各国人民的历史”。
    有两种人民观点：一种是历来反动统治阶级对人民的观点，认为人民是愚昧无知的，落后的，被动的，是天生的奴隶牛马，应当用鞭子对待。他们污辱反抗反动统治阶级的人民为奸匪，为叛逆，把一切污秽的字眼尽量地堆在人民身上。晚近资产阶级革命家，对人民的观点有了进步，不再把人民看作奴隶，而承认人民是主人了，但又认为这个主人是个阿斗太子，昏庸无能，必须有个诸葛亮替他保驾。一种是历史唯物主义对人民的观点，认为人民有伟大的智慧，有无限的创造力。毛主席的人民观点，是真正马克思列宁主义的历史唯物主义的观点，例如他说：
    “人民，只有人民，才是创造世界的动力。”
    “群众是真正的英雄。”
    “人民群众的创造力是无穷无尽的。”
    “三个臭皮匠，合成一个诸葛亮，这就是说，群众有伟大的创造力。中国人民中间，实在有成千成万的诸葛亮，每个乡村，每个市镇，都有那里的诸葛亮。”
    毛主席认为群众中间就有成千成万的诸葛亮，群众自己就是诸葛亮，不需要再在群众以外去给群众找诸葛亮。
    毛主席谆谆诰诫我们说：“应使每一个同志懂得：只要我们依靠人民，坚决地相信人民群众的创造力是无穷无尽的，因而信任人民，和人民打成一片，那就任何困难也能克服，任何敌人也不能压倒我们，而只会被我们所压倒。”
    群众有没有落后现象？有落后现象。但是我们应当怎样来认识这些落后现象？群众的落后现象，绝不是群众的生性本质，不是群众生来就落后。孔子曾说：“唯上智与下愚不移”，这是形而上学的观点，是完全错误的。群众的落后现象，是由反动统治阶级长期愚民政策与残酷剥削压迫的结果。他们惟恐怕人民聪明起来会危害他们的统治，因而想尽一切方法来闭塞人民的头脑，同时把人民剥削得求生不暇，根本就没有学习文化的机会。正如毛主席所说：“专制主义利于人民愚昧”。在过去专制帝王与帝国主义封建法西斯统治之下，不知摧残、破坏、埋没了多少人民中的天才、才能和智慧！所以毛主席说：“民族压迫与封建压迫，残酷地束缚着中国人民的个性发展”。只要稍稍有点历史唯物主义观点，对于群众的落后现象，就应该这样看法，才是正确的。群众一旦在经济上、政治上、思想上获得解放，个性发展的束缚一旦解除，阶级觉悟一经启发和提高，他们的创造力与智慧就有了发挥与发展的机会。这已经为苏联的工人阶级劳动人民，东欧新民主国家的工人阶级劳动人民与中国解放区的工人阶级劳动人民所证实了。苏联十月革命以后的工人和农民，不就是不久以前沙皇统治下的工人和农民吗？还是这些工人和农民，在十月革命以后，却能创造出来一个光辉烂灿、亘古未有的社会主义共和国。今天我们解放区的工人和农民，不就是不久以前旧中国的工人和农民吗？可是人民解放战争的伟大胜利，不就是他们的伟大创造吗？解放区各工厂的许多创造和发明不就是这些工人的成就么？
    从戴新民同志的文章中所反映的我们某些工厂干部对于工人的态度，来看看他们对于工人的观点是怎样的。
    他们认为：“没有教育好的工人，只有自私自利……”
    他们认为：“不拍桌子，不发脾气，不处罚……纪律即难维持……”
    他们认为：“工人能提出多少完整的意见？顶多提一些零零星星的东西。……”
    他们认为：强调依靠工人群众，“是不利于职工团结的”。
    他们要求“对职员要宽，对工人要严。”
    他们见到工人有些落后表现时，即“深恶痛绝”，“会气得拍桌子，骂放屁……以至开除。”
    他们甚至说：“我个人并不是工人阶级出身，对工人阶级这样‘捧’！……我个人是个干部，是个职员，对干部，对职员，这样求全责备！”
    “他们在思想上把自己与工人阶级对立起来，把职员与工人阶级对立起来”。
    “他们并不把工人当主人翁来看”。
    有一个干部动员工人学习时讲：“要好好学习，否则，当一辈子工人，有什么用啊！”
    这些完全是一种严重的反历史唯物主义的思想和情绪。他们轻视劳动，轻视工人，对工人缺乏同情。他们自诩不是工人阶级出身，他们对工人阶级的态度和感情，是资产阶级的态度和感情。他们很自高自大，不是在给工人阶级当勤务员，而是在当工人阶级的上司。有着这样的态度、感情、思想和情绪，怎么能接近工人，看得起工人，注意听取工人意见，以至相信工人，依靠工人阶级，放手施行民主，实施工厂管理民主化呢？当然是不可能的。这些同志，假若过去读过历史唯物主义书本，那也只是作了教条主义的学习，并没有依据历史唯物主义来改造自己的思想，建立正确的人民观点，更不会把这种马克思主义的普遍真理与具体的实际工作结合起来。他们更不懂得毛主席就是最善于用历史唯物主义来指导中国革命，历史唯物主义思想，象一根红线一样贯穿在毛主席的全部著作中。正是由于这些同志缺乏历史唯物主义思想，所以他们也就对于工人没有正确观点，对于工人的某些落后现象，没有正确认识，因而使得他们不敢相信工人，不敢依靠工人阶级，不敢放手施行民主，有事不敢与群众商量，不敢走群众路线。我觉得这才是阻碍实现工厂管理民主化之更基本的思想根源。当然，这同他们的阶级出身也是有关系的。
    由于他们缺乏历史唯物主义思想，他们便不懂得我党从群众中来，到群众中去，集中起来，坚持下去的领导方法，也是贯彻着历史唯物主义思想的。他们不懂得“三个臭皮匠合成一个诸葛亮”是什么意思，因而责备工人“想不出完整的意见，顶多提一些零零星星的东西”；不懂得：所谓“集中起来”，就是要领导者把群众的零星的、分散的、无系统的意见，经过研究，化为系统的、集中的意见，然后再坚持下去。他们不懂得，毛主席早就告诉过我们：“革命的政治家们，懂得革命的政治科学或政治艺术的政治家们，他们只是千千万万的群众政治家的领袖，他们的任务在于把群众政治家的意见集中起来，加以提炼，再使之回到群众中去，为群众所领受，所实践，而不是闭门造车，自作聪明，只此一家，别无分店的那种贵族式的所谓政治家—这是无产阶级政治家与有产阶级政治家的原则区别，也是无产阶级政治与有产阶级政治的原则区别”。
    由此可见，缺乏历史唯物主义思想，缺乏历史唯物主义的人民观点的人，也就不能实行我党的这种历史唯物主义的领导方法，因而也就不能走群众路线。
    我们有些同志还不懂得区别两种作风：即密切联系群众的作风，有事与群众商量的作风，群众路线的作风，这是历史唯物主义的作风，是共产党所应有的作风。另一种是强迫命令、包办代替、官僚主义的作风，脱离群众的作风，这是反历史唯物主义的作风，是国民党的作风。作风不是一个简单的态度问题，技术问题，而是一个思想问题。作风乃是思想本质的表现。
    为什么说强迫命令、包办代替、官僚主义，是国民党作风呢？因为国民党是代表大地主、大资产阶级的，他们的一切政策法令的制订，都是从大地主、大资产阶级利益出发的，是与人民利益完全对立的，所以他们要贯彻他们的政策法令，就非强迫命令，强制执行不可。而且他们是把群众看作奴隶牛马的，自然认为不打不骂不行。其次，他们既然认为群众是阿斗太子，有权无能，所以就要给群众当诸葛亮，这也是来自反历史唯物主义的人民观点，是典型的包办代替思想。我们共产党是代表无产阶级劳动人民利益的，我们的一切政策法令的制订，都是从无产阶级劳动人民利益出发的，是与无产阶级劳动人民利益完全符合的，所以只要把道理给群众说清楚，启发了群众的阶级觉悟，群众自己会自觉自愿执行的。因此，我们只用说服教育的方法就够了，根本用不着强迫命令。其次，我们认为群众有伟大的智慧，无限的创造力，这个主人是有权有能的主人，群众当中就有成千成万的诸葛亮，只要启发了群众的觉悟，群众自己就会行动起来。群众的解放是群众自己的事业，这种革命原则，就是从这种思想来的。所以我们也根本反对包办代替作风。我们的作风，是从我们的历史唯物主义的人民观点来的。
    我们的党章总纲中规定：“中国共产党以马克思列宁主义的辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义为基础”，因此，希望我们所有工作干部，都要好好学习历史唯物主义思想，用历史唯物主义思想来改造自己的非历史唯物主义甚至反历史唯物主义的思想，要学会把历史唯物主义思想贯彻在我们的一切实际工作与日常生活之中。须知作一个共产党的干部，若没有历史唯物主义的人民观点，就不能站稳无产阶级立场，就不能彻底克服个人英雄主义，就不能彻底克服强迫命令、包办代替、官僚主义作风，就不能确立密切联系群众、有事与群众商量、群众路线的作风。没有历史唯物主义的人民观点，就不能树立信任群众，依靠群众的信心，不能执行全心全意依靠工人阶级的政治路线就就不能实行从群众中来，到群众中去的领导方法。
