【This Municipality News】 The Bureau of Industry and Commerce, in order to strengthen guidance for the production of the knitting industry, convened a symposium on the 15th. Over twenty representatives from the Department Store Branch, the General Supply and Marketing Cooperative, the Cooperative Bank, and the knitting industry attended. Chen Ji, the Section Chief of the Bureau of Industry and Commerce, first explained that the past production guidance for the knitting industry was insufficient, leading to blind development and products of very low quality and non-standard specifications, which affected sales. As a result, factories were in a state of semi-shutdown. This situation should be quickly corrected and resolved, and he hoped that all relevant departments would cooperate well in carrying out this work. Subsequently, everyone expressed their opinions. Due to the low product quality and non-standard specifications, the Department Store Company has a large backlog of goods that cannot be sold. Some of the loans issued by the Cooperative Bank cannot be recovered. The meeting concluded that in addition to actively promoting existing inventory (the trade association requested the establishment of a joint sales office in Dongxiaoshi), the rectification of knitting industry production is extremely urgent. The scattered and disorganized households should first be organized into several guild groups. Such organizations should meet the requirements of the government and all parties for support, and be organized separately according to region and factory type (electric motors, manual labor, independent labor). The Bureau of Industry and Commerce will be primarily responsible for the grouping of electric motor and manual labor households, and the General Supply and Marketing Cooperative will be responsible for organizing independent laborers into cooperatives, in order to achieve regular production that meets sales needs.

　　整顿针织业
  　工商局召开座谈会
    【本市讯】工商局为加强针织业生产的指导，于十五日召开座谈会，到百货分公司、供销合作总社、合作银行及针织业代表二十余人。首由工商局陈纪科长说明过去对针织业的生产指导不够，曾经盲目发展，质量非常低、规格不合标准，影响销路，以致工厂陷于半停顿的状态，这是应当赶快纠正和解决的，并希望各有关部门进行这一工作时，要很好的配合。继由大家发表意见。由于产品质量低，不合规格，百货公司收的货现尚积压的很多，销不出去，合作银行贷出的款有些也收不回来。会上大家认为除积极推销存货（同业公会要求在东晓市成立联合售货处）外，对针织业生产的整顿是非常迫切的，应先把零乱的分散户组织成若干公会小组，这样的组织要适合政府和各方扶植的要求，按照地域、工厂类型（电机、手工、独立劳动）分别组织，由工商局为主进行电机和手工厂户的编组工作，由供销总社进行独立劳动者组织合作社的工作。以便达到合乎销路的正规生产。
