Punish the atrocities of the Czech and German priests
　　Beijing Student Federation and other organizations, as well as teachers and students from various schools, unanimously support the students of Fu Jen Middle School
[Our Newspaper] The Beijing Student Federation, Women's Federation, primary and secondary school teachers and other organizations, as well as teachers and students from various schools, have protested against the atrocities of the Czech priest Zeng Dewang, the German priest Ji Futai and others for illegally detaining six students from Fu Jen Boys' Middle School, demanding severe punishment for the imperialist elements, and expressing their condolences to the victimized students of Fu Jen Middle School, expressing their full support.
　　The Beijing Student Federation sent a letter to the students of Fu Jen Boys' Middle School on the 29th, saying: "When we heard about the incident in which six students from your school were illegally detained for half an hour by five foreign priests on the 25th of this month, we felt extremely indignant. After the Tianjin People's Court punished the French imperialist Gai Sijie for infringing on our students' freedom, a similar incident occurred again in Beijing, the people's capital. This shows that the imperialist elements are not reconciled to the victory of the Chinese people and that they are still trying to continue to oppress the Chinese people. We must teach these unreasonable imperialist elements a lesson: illegally detaining Chinese students is insulting the Chinese people and violating the laws of the Chinese People's Government. This is absolutely intolerable and must be punished by the people's law."
　　The person in charge of the preparatory committee of the Beijing Democratic Women's Federation made a special statement yesterday (29th) as follows: The imperialist behavior of the German and Czech priests Zeng Dewang and others from Fu Jen Affiliated Middle School is infuriating. Today, when the Chinese people have stood up and the People's Republic of China has been born, Zeng Dewang and others ignored the facts and the lessons of Gai Sijie, daring to treat our students with barbaric means. We Chinese people should give them the punishment they deserve. In addition to expressing our sincere sympathy and condolences to the six students of Fu Jen Affiliated Middle School who were detained, we propose that the students of Fu Jen Affiliated Middle School immediately file a lawsuit with the People's Court and hand these imperialist elements over to the people's legal sanctions!
　　The Beijing Primary and Secondary School Teachers' Union has issued a protest letter on this matter. The protest letter said: "We believe that the actions of the Czech and German priests are not accidental. Due to the nature of imperialism and the shameless betrayal of the country by the past Kuomintang reactionaries, they have been accustomed to oppressing and bullying the Chinese people; therefore, they cannot stand and are unwilling to see the Chinese people stand up in their own country; therefore, when the Chinese people have indeed stood up in front of them, and are so jubilantly preparing to celebrate the founding ceremony, they have staged this despicable and shameless imperialist atrocity. We fully agree with and support the protest of all teachers and students of Fu Jen Boys' and Girls' Middle School: we will not tolerate this illegal oppression of the Chinese people, we will file a lawsuit with the People's Court, and we will demand that it be dealt with according to law."
　　In addition, the Peking University School Committee, Student Union, General Branch of the Communist Party of China, General Branch of the Communist Youth League, Staff Union, Trade Union of Workers and Police and other six organizations, the Fu Jen University Council, and President Chen Yuan, professors Zhao Guangxian, Liu Jingfang, Chai Degeng and all the students of Hebei High School, have sent letters or made statements protesting against the atrocities of the imperialist elements, demanding that the People's Government punish them, and expressing their condolences to the victimized students, expressing their full support.

　　惩处捷德籍神甫暴行
  　京市学联等团体及各校师生一致支援辅中同学
    【本报讯】北京市学联、妇联、中小学教职等团体及各校师生，纷纷抗议捷籍神甫曾德望、德籍神甫纪福泰等五人非法扣留辅仁男中六同学的暴行，要求严惩帝国主义分子；并慰问辅中受害同学，表示全力支援。
    市学联于二十九日致函辅仁男中同学说：“当我们听到你们学校六位同学在本月二十五日被五个外国神甫非法扣留半小时的事件以后，感到万分激愤，在天津人民法院惩办了侵害我们同学自由的法籍帝国主义者盖斯杰以后，在人民首都的北京又发生了类似事件，这说明帝国主义分子对于中国人民的胜利是不甘心的，他们还企图继续欺压中国人民，我们必须教训这些横蛮无理的帝国主义分子：非法扣留中国学生，就是侮辱中国人民、而且违犯了中国人民政府的法律。这是绝对不能容许的，并必须受到人民法律的处分。”
    北京市民主妇女联合会筹委会负责人昨（二十九）日特发表谈话如下：辅仁附中德、捷籍神甫曾德望等人的帝国主义行为，是令人愤慨的。在中国人民已经站立起来，中华人民共和国已经诞生的今天，曾德望等竟无视事实，无视盖斯杰的教训，敢于以蛮横手段对待我们同学，我们中国人民就应该给他们以应得的惩罚，我们除了对辅仁附中遭受扣留的六同学致亲切的同情与慰问外，并提议附中同学立刻向人民法院起诉，把这些帝国主义分子交付人民法律制裁！
    北京市中小学教职员联合会特为此发出抗议书，抗议书说：“我们认为：捷德籍神甫的这种勾当，不是偶然的。由于帝国主义的本质加以过去国民党反动派的无耻卖国，他们压迫欺侮中国人民已是习惯成性的了；因此，就看不惯，也不愿意看中国人民在自己的国土上站立起来；因此，当着中国人民的的确确在他们面前站起来，并且那样欢欣鼓舞地准备热烈庆祝开国大典的时候，就演出了这种卑鄙无耻的帝国主义暴行。我们完全同意并支持辅仁男女附中全体师生的抗议：不宽容这种非法欺压中国人民的暴行，向人民法院起诉，要求依法处理。”
    此外北大校委会、学生会、中共总支、青年团总支、职员会、工警工会等六团体，辅大院联会及陈垣校长、赵光贤、刘景芳、柴德赓等教授和河北高中全体同学，都致函或发表谈话，抗议帝国主义分子的暴行，要求人民政府予以处分；并慰问受害同学，表示全力支援。
