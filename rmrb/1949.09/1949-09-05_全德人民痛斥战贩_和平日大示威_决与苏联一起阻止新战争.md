Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 4th: Berlin Dispatch: The German people warmly commemorated the "Peace Day" of September 1st, declared by the German People's Council – the tenth anniversary of Hitler's attack on Poland and the outbreak of World War II. In the Soviet occupation zone, mass rallies and demonstrations were held in cities and towns. In Berlin, 400,000 people participated in a grand peace demonstration on Bebelplatz, with thousands of flags flying, bearing slogans calling for peace and international friendship. Wilhelm Pieck, Chairman of the German People's Council, in his opening address, denounced the warmongers, stating: "The warmongers are those who launch slanderous anti-Soviet campaigns, those who demand revision of the current Oder-Neisse border between Germany and Poland. The warmongers are those who concluded the North Atlantic Treaty and made a peace treaty with Germany impossible." Polish writer Kruczkowski delivered a speech, pointing out: "After years of trying, after years of passively succumbing to evil forces, a considerable force has gradually grown among the German people, conducting a common struggle for peace and against the imperialist warmongers. This force now faces a great, historic task; they must win a decisive victory for the German national soul." The大会 (Dàhuì - Congress/Assembly) unanimously adopted a resolution condemning all war actions and calling on the world's forces of peace and progress, led by the Soviet Union, to fight together for peace. In Saxony-Anhalt, more than 2,000 districts and large enterprises held rallies, with a total participation of two million people. Many mass rallies were also held near the border between the Soviet and Western occupation zones, with many representatives from the Western occupation zones participating. In the Western occupation zones, despite the obstruction of the American and British occupation authorities, demonstrations were held in many places. The people of Hamburg held a grand rally under the auspices of the Peace Committee. The Free German Youth League of North Rhine-Westphalia issued a resolution on Peace Day, stating that German youth are determined to prevent a new war and protect world peace.
