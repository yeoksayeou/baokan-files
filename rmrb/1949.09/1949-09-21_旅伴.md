　　Traveling Companions
    (By Soviet author Panova, translated by Su Ling, proofread by Cao Jinghua)
    Part One: Night
    Chapter Four: Yulia

    "Carry this child to bunk number eleven on Bilov's car," the doctor said to Nurse Smirnova, who came in with him. "That woman..."
    "That woman is no longer needed," said Olga, the assistant military doctor who was standing at the second table, acting as an assistant. She removed the mask from the woman's face. A broad, high-cheekboned, Slavic face with thick, dark eyebrows. A beautiful mouth. A brown freckle on the nose...
    "Too late," the surgeon said.

    Suddenly, it threw him onto the table where the child was lying, throwing the child to the ground. Everyone except Yulia was knocked down. Only she was thrown against the doorway of the dressing room, grabbing the iron hook for hanging towels. Flakes of white paint fell from the ceiling and walls. A piece of the window frame fell, its sharp edge piercing Yulia's temple.
    "That was close," Dr. Bilov said.
    "Very close," Yulia said firmly, holding the child up. "I think they're hitting our train directly."

    Soldiers Kolicyn and Mayvejev ran into the car from both ends of the medic car, shouting:
    "The fourteenth car is on fire! The commander is there!"

    The commander, who was already on the roadbed, was running towards the burning car with all his strength.

    Dry wood, dry paint – it was burning fiercely. Fortunately, there were no wounded soldiers on board. Were all the staff safe? Safe, all safe: wasn't that Naga, bending over and vomiting...? Her coat was covered in blood.
    "Naga, what's wrong – are you hurt?"
    "Oh, it's nothing, Comrade Commander. I just broke my lip on the shelf on the wall."
    "Is Kolicyn alive?"
    "Alive, he went to look for you..."

    That was him, Kolicyn running. He was carrying a bucket of water. What good was a bucket of water... Mayvejev was following behind him.

    Kratov and Nivitski came from the other direction. They were walking as if their knees had been broken.
    "Hurry, brothers, hurry!" the doctor shouted.

    Nivitski ran quickly. Kratov was still walking slowly, his hands in his pockets.
    "Brothers, go and fetch water," the doctor said excitedly. "Call everyone, let's put out the fire."
    "But where's the water?" Kratov asked casually.
    "Water? There's water in the water tank. There's water on the locomotive..."
    "What use is this drop of water," Kratov said, then suddenly shouted:
    "Hey! Detach the car! Idiots, the generator is right next to it, and they're just looking around, as if nothing's happening! Hey, friend," he grabbed a greaser who was passing by, "give me a hand, old hand. We must detach this car."
    "Inexplicable!" the greaser said. "Thousands upon thousands of cars are being destroyed, and I'm supposed to detach this one car?"
    "It has to be detached, friend," Kratov said. "There are wounded soldiers here, and there's a generator here. There's no other way but to detach it."
    "You're a real nuisance! Asking to detach a car under bombing," the greaser said.
    "I order you to do it!" Kratov glared and slapped the greaser. The doctor was stunned... The greaser kicked Kratov in the stomach. Kratov punched him in the back of the head. The greaser cursed again and climbed up to detach the burning car. The car guard emerged from nowhere, covered in mud; he must have been lying in a nearby bomb crater. They dragged the burning car to a distance and watered it with water from the locomotive.

    Meanwhile, Yulia stood at the table, handing instruments and small towels to the professor. She was preparing the wounded for surgery. Applying anesthesia... The city was fighting all night, and wounded soldiers were constantly being transported to the car. Some were carried on stretchers, some were transported in trucks, some walked on their own... By morning, the professor couldn't take it anymore.
    "Enough," he said, tearing the ties of his coat without taking the time to untie them. "I can't. I've been working for five days and five nights..."

    Peili helped him to the commander's car to rest, and by chance, she told Yulia that she also needed to clear her head and change her clothes. The gore had made her nauseous, and her clothes were soaked with sweat.
    "I have to stop too," another small, dark-haired surgeon with a lemon-yellow face said as he went out. Olga lay down on the sofa in the washroom: "Just lie down for a little while, just a little while," she said in a childish voice, and immediately fell asleep. Only one young surgeon remained, with short, light-colored hair and a rudder-like nose, taller than Danilov.

　　旅伴
    （苏联潘诺瓦著苏龄译曹靖华校）
    第一部　夜
    第四章　尤丽
    “把这孩子抬到比洛夫车上十一号铺位，”医生对跟他进来的斯密诺瓦护士说。“那个女子……”
    “那个女子用不着了，”站在第二张桌子跟前当助手的助理军医娥尔加说着。她把面罩从那女子脸上揭去。一付宽大的，大颧骨的，斯拉夫型的面貌，浓黑的眉毛。美丽的口。鼻子上有一条棕色的雀班……
    “迟了，”外科医生说。
    突然把他扔到躺着孩子的那张桌子上，把孩子扔到地下去，除尤丽以外，都被震倒了，只有她被撞到裹伤室门口，抓住挂手巾的铁钩。白漆皮从天花板和墙上落下来。一块窗框震落下来，尖利的棱角，刺到尤丽的太阳穴上。
    “这很近呢，”比洛夫医生说。
    “很近，”尤丽把孩子往起抱着，肯定的说。“我想这是一直照咱们的列车打呢。”
    兵士柯里岑和麦威洁夫从药车的两头跑进车里，大叫着：
    “第十四辆车厢着火了！司令在那儿！”
    司令，当时已经到路基上，拼着全力朝着火的车厢跟前跑去了。
    干木料，干油漆——烧得很凶。车上还没有伤兵，真是万幸。工作人员全都安全吗？安全的，都安全的：那不是娜迦呵，她弯着身子在吐着………她的衣罩上都是血迹。
    “娜迦，你怎么了——受伤了吗？”
    “唉呀，这那的话，司令同志。这是我在墙上的橱架上把嘴唇碰破了。”
    “柯里岑活着的吗？”
    “活着的，去找你去了…………”
    那就是他，就是柯里岑在跑呢。手里提着一桶水。一桶水这有什么用呢……麦威洁夫也在他后边跟着。
    克拉错夫和尼威茨基从另一方面来了。他们走着，就好象他们的膝盖被打断了似的。
    “快点，弟兄们，快点！”医生喊起来。
    尼威茨基快跑着。克拉错夫照旧不紧不慢的走来，两手插在裤子兜里。
    “弟兄们，都去提水去，”医生激动的说。“把一切人都叫来，咱们来灌救。”
    “可是水在那儿呢？”克拉错夫轻率的问道。
    “水吗？水柜里有水。车头上也有水……”
    “这一滴滴儿水有什么用呢，”克拉错夫说着，就突然大叫起来：
    “喂！把车厢摘下来！傻瓜，发电机就在旁边，而他们却东张西望，若无其事呢！喂，好朋友，”他抓住了一个打他身边过的注油夫的衣襟，“帮帮忙吧，老行手。一定要把这辆车厢摘下来的。”
    “莫名其妙！”注油夫说着。“千千万万的车厢都糟塌了，我还来摘这一个车厢吗。”
    “必需要摘的，好朋友，”克拉错夫说。“这儿有伤兵，这儿有发电机呢。没别的办法，只有把它摘下来。”
    “你真是活见鬼！在炸弹下叫摘车厢呢，”注油夫说着。
    “我命令你作的！”克拉错夫把眼一瞪，就给注油夫了一个耳光。医生吃惊的发呆起来……注油夫照着克拉错夫的肚子踢了一脚。克拉错夫又照他后脑窝上给了一拳。注油夫又骂了一声，就爬去摘那一辆燃烧着的车厢去了。车守不知从那儿冒出来，身上满是泥土；大概是躺在附近的炸弹坑里呢。把燃烧着的车厢拖到远处，就用车头上的水浇起来。
    这时候，尤丽站在桌旁，给教授递着器械和小方巾。她替伤兵准备着动手术。上着麻药……这城市整夜都在战斗着，整夜不断的往车上运着伤兵。有些是用担架抬来的，有些是用卡车运来的，有些是自己走来的……早晨的时候，教授真受不住了。
    “够了，”他说着，来不及把衣罩的带子解开，就把它扯断了。“我不能够。我已经五天五夜……”
    裴丽把他扶到司令车上休息去了，遇巧她告诉了尤丽一声，她也有点清醒过来，换着衣服，这血腥已经使得她发呕了，她的衣服也都汗湿透了。
    “我也要歇手了，”另一位小身个，黑发，柠檬黄面孔的外科医生，说着就出去了。娥尔加就在洗涤室的沙发上躺下来：“少躺一小会，躺一小会，”她用孩子似的声音说罢，就立刻睡着了。只剩下一位年轻的外科医生了，他有剪得短短的淡色的头发。舵似的鼻子，个子比达尼洛夫高。
