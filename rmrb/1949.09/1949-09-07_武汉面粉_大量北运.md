　　Wuhan Flour
  　Large Quantities Transported North
    [Hankou Dispatch] Since the liberation of Wuhan, transportation routes have gradually been restored. The first batch of 6,750 bags of "Wannianqing" brand flour produced by the privately-owned Shengxin Flour Company of this city and destined for North China (Tianjin) was shipped via the Pinghan Railway on August 28th. A second batch of over 6,000 bags is being prepared for northbound transport. It is reported that the company's "Wannianqing" brand flour has a long history of sales in various parts of North China (Tianjin), with annual sales reaching hundreds of thousands of bags in the past. It is also understood that other flour mills are also planning to sell to the North. The flour industry in this city has always relied on large-scale northbound transport for its development. Since the suspension of northbound transport, it has stagnated. Now that North-South transportation has been restored, it has brought a bright future for the flour industry.

　　武汉面粉
  　大量北运
    【汉口讯】武汉解放后各路交通相继恢复，本市私营企业胜新面粉公司首批运往华北（天津）面粉六千七百五十袋，已于上月二十八日由平汉路车运出口，并已准备第二批六千余袋待车北运。据悉，该公司所制万年青牌面粉行销华北（平津）各地已有悠久历史，过去每年销数达数十万袋，又悉其他粉厂也在计划北销。按本市面粉工业一向靠大量北运而发展，自北运停顿后，即陷于呆滞状态，现在南北交通恢复，为面粉工业带来了光明的前途。
