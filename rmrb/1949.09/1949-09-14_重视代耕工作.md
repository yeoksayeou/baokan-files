　　Emphasize Substitute Farming Work

　　This year, various areas in Chahar Province have placed great emphasis on substitute farming work. Generally, they have ensured that the land of revolutionary martyrs and military families is sown and hoed on time, and have paid attention to manure accumulation and fertilization. As a result, autumn crops are thriving. In some areas, preparations for autumn wheat sowing were already underway when green manure was being pressed. This has made Chahar's substitute farming work surpass any previous year. The experience of this work should be learned by other provinces and regions.
　　The experience of various liberated areas in the past and the experience of various areas in Chahar Province this year have repeatedly proven that to carry out the agricultural large-scale production movement in rural areas, substitute farming work must be one of the important contents, and it must be implemented. The focus of substitute farming work is in the village. Therefore, first, it is necessary to attach importance to clearing the minds of village cadres and the masses, so that everyone understands that doing a good job in substitute farming work is a powerful support for the front line and a consolidation of the troops in order to win the victory across the country. Farmers should be called upon to recall how they achieved their liberation. Without the People's Liberation Army, the liberation of the peasants and the liberation of the people of the whole country would be completely impossible. Therefore, we must cultivate the land of revolutionary martyrs and military families well, otherwise we will be letting down the soldiers at the front. For every Communist Party member, it is even more necessary to carry out education on cherishing the Party and the army. Secondly, it is necessary to promptly check, investigate, and study the progress of substitute farming work and summarize experiences. In particular, county and district cadres must go deep into the villages, hold symposiums with revolutionary martyrs and military families to solicit opinions; personally go to their homes and fields to conduct actual inspections and solve their difficulties. This inspection work has formed a system in many areas. Conversely, in a few areas, only arrangements are made without inspection, so that substitute farming work cannot be effective or deviations occur.
　　The form of substitute farming must be acceptable to the masses, as has been proven by a year of practice. The "contract system" and "work point system" have been proven to be the most popular among the masses; the "assigned labor system" has been gradually eliminated. There are also several types of "contract system," some are large contracts with guaranteed yield and contracts, and some are small contracts without guaranteed yield, only fixing the contracting household (or contracting team) and stipulating the number of workdays and acres contracted. The common advantage of these systems is that they can guarantee a certain yield from the land of revolutionary martyrs and military families, improve the enthusiasm of substitute farming households and save labor; in most areas, the system of large contracts is adopted for the land of lonely and widowed revolutionary martyrs, military families, and workers' families who have no labor force, and good results have been achieved. The work point system is that the village assesses the number of workdays for substitute farming, reports it to the district level for approval, and the county level prints and distributes work points to the households that should receive substitute farming, and stipulates the price of work, which is paid in rice, generally higher than the market price, which is borne by the village and uniformly controlled. The holder of the work points can receive rice and hire labor freely. Because the price of rice per work is high, everyone is happy to be hired, which is much easier than assigning labor in the past. This method basically replaces labor with rice, which can improve production efficiency, save labor, and balance the burden of substitute farming, and the effect is also very good. However, no matter what form is adopted, it depends on mobilizing the masses, promoting democracy, and conducting fair and reasonable evaluation, and promptly checking and correcting deviations. Otherwise, even if there is a good organizational form for substitute farming, malpractices will inevitably occur.
　　Some areas have found that some serious deviations have occurred in the substitute farming work, that is: first, some areas have a coercive and commanding style, forcing the masses to adopt a certain substitute farming method without carrying out patient persuasion and assistance. Second, some set the output too low, or because the substitute farming households have an attitude of coping with the task, they do not work hard, or individual military families do not use the work rice they receive for production, so that the actual production results are very small. Third, some village cadres have departmentalism, over-reporting the number of substitute farming workdays and acres, and the leadership must pay attention to correcting it. However, some of these deviations have been corrected, and some are gradually being corrected.
　　We believe that the substitute farming work in Chahar Province this year is basically successful, and its experience needs to be promoted. At present, various places are still in the tense season of autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and autumn planting. It is hoped that other provinces and regions that have not paid attention to substitute farming work should pay attention to it in the future, conduct inspections and summaries, so that future substitute farming work will achieve more widespread results.

### 重视代耕工作

　　重视代耕工作
    今年察哈尔各地对代耕工作十分重视，一般都保证了革命烈士和军人家属土地按时耕种、锄苗，并注意积肥和施肥，因而秋苗旺盛，若干地区，当着压绿肥的时候，就已经为秋季种麦做了准备。这样就使得察哈尔今年的代耕工作超过了以往任何一年。此项工作的经验，应该引起其他省区注意学习。
    以往各解放区的经验和今年察省各地的经验一再地证明了在农村中要开展农业大生产运动，必须以代耕工作为重要内容之一，并使之贯彻实现。代耕工作的重点在于村。因此，第一，必须重视打通村干部与群众的思想，使大家了解做好代耕工作，就是有力地支援前线、巩固部队以争取全国的胜利。应该号召农民们回忆一下自己是怎样得到翻身的，如果没有人民解放军，农民的翻身和全国人民的解放都将是完全不可能的。因此，必须把革命烈士和军人家属的土地种好，否则就对不起前方战士。对于每一个共产党员，更必须进行爱护党军的教育。其次，必须及时检查、及时调查研究代耕工作进行的情况和总结经验。特别是县区干部，必须深入到村，召开革命烈士与军人家属座谈会，征求意见；亲自到他们的家里、地里，进行实际检查，解决他们的困难。这种检查工作，在不少地区已形成了制度。反之，也有少数地区，只布置不检查，以致代耕工作不能收效或发生偏向。
    代耕的形式必须使群众乐意接受，这也是一年的实践所证明了的。“包工制”和“工票制”已被证明是最受群众欢迎的；“派工制”则已逐渐被淘汰了。“包工制”也有几种，有的是包产量、订合同的大包工，有的是不包产量只固定包耕户（或包工组）并规定所包的工数、亩数的小包工。这些制度的共同优点是可以保证革命烈士与军人家属土地有一定的产量，提高代耕户的积极性并节省劳力；多数地区对于孤寡无劳力的烈、军、工属的土地，采取大包工的制度，收到很好的成绩。工票制是由村中评议代耕的工数，报告区级批准后，由县级印发工票，交应受代耕之户收执，并规定工价，以米支付，一般高于市价，由村摊付，统一掌握，持票者即可领米，自由雇佣，因工米价高，人人均乐于受雇，比过去派工容易多了。这种办法基本上是以米代工，可使生产效率提高，劳力节省，代耕负担亦得以平衡，收效也很好，但不论采用何种形式，均有赖于发动群众、发扬民主、公平合理地进行评议，并及时检查与纠正偏向。否则，虽有良好的代耕组织形式，仍不免会发生流弊。
    有些地区曾经发现在代耕工作中发生了若干严重的偏向，这就是：第一，有的地区存在着强迫命令的作风，强制群众采用某种代耕办法，而不进行耐心的说服和帮助。第二，有的把产量定得太低，或因代耕户抱着应差态度，不力生产，或有个别军人家属领得工米后不用于生产，以致实际生产的成绩很少。第三，有的村干部存在着本位主义思想，多报代耕工数与亩数，必须从领导上注意予以纠正。但是这些偏向，有的已经被纠正了，有的正在逐渐被纠正。
    我们认为，今年察省的代耕工作，基本上是成功的，其经验有推广的必要，目前各地还正处在秋收秋耕秋种的紧张季节，希望其他省区，未注意代耕工作的，今后应切实予以注意，进行检查与总结，使今后的代耕工作获得更普遍的成绩。
