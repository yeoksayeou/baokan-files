　　A Fate of Failure Awaits Warmongers
　　Huang Caoliang
　　Recently, a series of actions by U.S. imperialism—directing Western European countries to ratify the North Atlantic Treaty, dispatching the chiefs of staff of the army, navy, and air force to Europe to engage in various activities to implement this aggressive pact, proposing the so-called "$1.45 billion military aid plan," and desperately staging the farce of the "Pacific Pact," as well as hysterically spreading war fever, etc.—have once again nakedly exposed the hideous face of the new warmongers who are actively preparing for war.

　　Faced with this terrifying image of imperialism, some people are frightened and make a fuss out of nothing, exclaiming: "A third world war is inevitable." Even that it's "coming soon," how terrible! Meanwhile, the Kuomintang remnants, led by Chiang Kai-shek, seeing that they are about to be completely wiped out by the People's Liberation Army, are fantasizing there, pinning their last hope on the miracle of the outbreak of a third world war, dreaming of making a comeback at that time.

　　But what is the reality? Is there any basis for the "third world war is inevitable" argument and the illusion of Chiang Kai-shek and his ilk relying on a third world war to "turn the tables"?

　　The danger of a new war does indeed exist. In the camp of the U.S. reactionaries, there are indeed some war adventurers who dream of finding a way out of the increasingly serious political and economic crises through war. They collude with warmongers from various countries, intensifying war preparations like madmen, planning to launch a sudden attack one day like Hitler, launching a third world war, defeating democratic forces, and enslaving the people of the world. From the announcement of the Truman Doctrine, the implementation of the Marshall Plan, the signing of the North Atlantic Treaty, the instigation of the Pacific Pact, to the recent proposal of the Truman military aid bill, all indicate that the plan of the U.S. war-mongers to prepare to launch a war of aggression is proceeding step by step. U.S. imperialists are setting up military bases in the North Atlantic, the Mediterranean, the Middle East, Turkey, and Iran. It is particularly noteworthy that U.S. imperialism is trying to support the reactionary forces of West Germany and Japan as its capable assistants in carrying out aggressive wars. It is wrong to fundamentally disregard and obliterate this fact. Because this will produce a harmful result, namely, paralyzing the vigilance of the world's people against the war policy of the international reactionaries headed by the United States, thereby losing or weakening the resistance to the instigators of new wars, allowing imperialism to take advantage of the opportunity of the people's unpreparedness to realize its arrogant plan for a new war.

　　However, a new war is not "inevitable," and there are sufficient conditions for overcoming the danger of war. The warmongers cannot do whatever they want. There are powerful people's forces in our world that oppose war, and this force is constantly growing. This is the main factor in overcoming the danger of war. At the same time, the imperialist camp itself is outwardly strong but inwardly weak and is becoming increasingly weak. A full four years have passed since the end of World War II. During these four years, the world has undergone great changes. The biggest change is the great development of the world people's peace and democratic forces, headed by the Soviet Union.

　　The result of World War II was the elimination of the three imperialist countries of Germany, Italy, and Japan, and the weakening of the two imperialist countries of Britain and France. The position and strength of the Soviet Union have been greatly enhanced. Many new democratic countries have emerged in Europe and Asia. The awakening of people all over the world has also been greatly enhanced. The entire international situation is favorable to the people's democratic camp. But four years ago, the countries of Eastern Europe and the recovered areas of the Soviet Union were scarred. The fifth columns of U.S. and British imperialism were rampant in the new democratic countries of Eastern Europe. Although the people's movements in Western Europe were springing up like mushrooms after rain, they lacked strong organizations. The strength of the people's movements in the colonial and semi-colonial countries of the Far East could not immediately defeat imperialism and the reactionaries. At that time in China, the Kuomintang reactionaries, with the help of U.S. imperialism, were baring their fangs and claws, and adopted a comprehensive offensive against the liberated areas. On a global scale, although the awareness and organization of the people of major capitalist countries had greatly improved compared with before the war, their understanding of the new situation after the war and the struggle against the international reactionary camp headed by U.S. imperialism was obviously insufficient. Today, four years later, the situation has changed drastically.

　　The socialist Soviet Union, which leads the defense of world peace, has further improved its national strength in the past four years. Now the Soviet Union has not only recovered from the wounds of war, but its productivity has exceeded the level of 1940 before the German fascists invaded the Soviet Union. In June of this year, the average daily total industrial output exceeded 41% of that in 1940, approaching the level of 1950, the last year of the new post-war five-year plan. The slogan of completing the five-year plan in four years will soon become a reality. At the same time, the Soviet Union's peaceful diplomatic policy has gained more and more support from the people of the world. Since the great leader of mankind, Stalin, who is fighting for peace, twice declared the Soviet Union's firm peaceful policy at the beginning of this year, more and more people have united around this policy. The increasing strength of the Soviet Union and the increasing enthusiastic support of people around the world for the Soviet Union have forced imperialism to adopt the strategy of resuming negotiations with the Soviet Union, reopening the foreign ministers' conference that had been suspended for a year and a half since November 1947, and enabled the foreign ministers' conference to achieve some success. At present, although U.S. imperialism is intensifying its preparations for war on the one hand, it has to continue to negotiate with the Soviet Union on the other. This fact is the best illustration of the strength of the Soviet Union and the weakness of the United States.

　　The new democratic countries of Europe are continuing to consolidate and grow stronger. Poland, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary and other countries have ended the post-war initial stage of domestic political life, due to the destructive activities of imperialism and its pawns, some unstable states occurred. The working classes of these countries have victoriously completed the task of clearing the right-wing Social Democratic elements, the agents of imperialism, from their ranks and establishing a unified working-class party over the past year. The reactionary scum of the landlords and bourgeoisie of these countries have been suppressed for their treasonous conspiracies and swept off the political stage. The communist working class parties have been strengthened ideologically, politically and organizationally and have definitely become the powerful leading forces in these countries. Thanks to the friendly assistance and mutual unity and cooperation of the Soviet Union, these countries have recovered from the wounds of war. Their plans for restoring and developing the economy are being successfully completed and exceeded, and their economic life is flourishing.

　　The people's democratic forces in the European capitalist countries, led by the people of France and Italy, as well as the people's democratic forces in the United States and Latin America, are also developing. The people of France and Italy have resolutely countered the attacks of the French and Italian reactionaries aided by the Marshall Plan, basically consolidated their gains, and are gradually moving forward. The British labor movement, with the exposure of the Labor government's pro-American diplomacy and the pressures of the economic crisis, is gradually breaking away from the influence of the right-wing leaders of the Labor Party. For example, at the recent 81st Congress of the Labor Party, the number of votes against the reactionary policies implemented by the right-wing leaders of the Labor Party has greatly increased, with 1,017,000 votes against withdrawing from the World Federation of Trade Unions and 2,760,000 votes demanding that union members serve as union representatives in the various nationalized industrial bureaus. Although the American people are under the despicable persecution and fanatical war propaganda of the reactionaries, they are still moving forward step by step, overcoming difficulties and not fearing setbacks. The recent protest by the progressive people of the United States against the fascist attack on the Robertson concert is a good manifestation of this persistent struggle. This has caused these bourgeois-ruled countries to be shrouded in an increasingly serious political crisis in addition to the economic crisis.

　　Due to the awakening of the people in the Asian colonial and semi-colonial countries, and also because the Soviet Union and the people of European countries have contained the forces of the imperialist reactionary bloc, the great national liberation movement throughout Asia has continued to rise and has achieved significant victories. This is one of the important features of the international situation after the war. The Chinese people, who account for nearly half of the population of Asia and a quarter of the world's population, defeated the Kuomintang reactionaries who received US$5.9 billion in aid from U.S. imperialism, and will soon achieve national victory. This is the third great victory in the world since the victory of the October Socialist Revolution in the Soviet Union.

　　失败的命运在等待着战争挑拨者
    黄操良
    最近以来，美帝国主义的一连串的行动——指挥西欧各国批准北大西洋公约，派遣海陆空三军参谋长去欧洲从事实施这个侵略公约的各种活动，提出十四亿五千万美元的所谓“军事援外计划”，竭力导演“太平洋联盟”的丑剧，以及歇斯特里地散布战争空气等等，再次赤裸裸地暴露了积极准备战争的新战争贩子的狰狞面目。
    在帝国主义的这种凶神恶煞面前，有一些人被吓唬住了，他们庸人自扰地大惊小怪：“第三次世界大战不可避免”。甚至“快要到来”，这怎么得了？而以蒋介石为首的国民党残匪，眼看到自己快要被人民解放军扫荡净尽，正在那里异想天开，把最后一线希望寄托在第三次世界大战爆发的奇迹上面，幻想在那时候卷土重来。
    但是，事实是怎样呢？“第三次世界大战不可避免论”和蒋介石之流依靠第三次世界大战“翻身”的幻想有什么根据没有呢？
    新战争的危险确实存在着。在美国反动派阵营中，的确有一些战争冒险家，他们梦想从战争中找寻挣脱日益严重发展着的政治危机和经济危机的道路。他们纠集各国的战争贩子，象疯人一样地加紧战争准备，打算有一天象希特勒那样来个突然袭击，发动第三次世界大战，击败民主势力，奴役全世界人民。从杜鲁门主义的宣布、马歇尔计划的实施、北大西洋公约的签订、太平洋联盟的策动，以至最近的杜鲁门军事援外法案的提出，都说明了美国战争贩子们的准备发动侵略战争的计划，正一步紧似一步地在进行。美帝国主义者在北大西洋，在地中海一带，在中东，在土耳其及伊朗，正布置着军事基地。特别值得注意的是美帝国主义力图扶植西德和日本的反动势力，作为它进行侵略战争的得力助手。根本轻视而抹煞这个事实是不对的。因为这会产生一个有害的结果，即麻痹世界人民对以美国为首的国际反动派的战争政策的警觉性，因而丧失或减弱对新战争挑拨者的抵抗力，使帝国主义可以乘人民没有准备的机会，实现新战争的狂妄计划。
    但是，新战争并不是“不可避免”，克服战争危险的条件是充分存在着的。战争贩子并不能为所欲为，我们的世界存在着强大的反对战争的人民力量，而这个力量正在不断地增长，这是克服战争危险的主要因素；同时帝国主义阵营本身则是外强中干，日趋衰弱。第二次世界大战结束到现在，过去了整整四年，在这四年中间，世界发生了很大的变化，其中最大变化就是：以苏联为首的世界人民和平民主力量的大发展。
    第二次世界大战的结果，是消灭了德意日三个帝国主义，削弱了英法两个帝国主义，而苏联的地位和力量大为增强，在欧亚两洲出现了许多新民主主义的国家，全世界人民的觉悟也大大提高，整个国际形势就是有利于人民民主阵营的。但在四年以前，东欧各国和苏联的收复区满目疮痍，美英帝国主义的第五纵队在东欧新民主国家猖獗得很；西欧的人民运动虽如雨后春笋，但却缺乏强有力的组织；远东殖民地半殖民地的人民运动的力量也还不能立时战胜帝国主义和反动派；那时的中国，国民党反动派在美帝国主义帮助之下张牙舞爪，对解放区采取全面的攻势；在世界范围内，各主要资本主义国家人民的觉悟性和组织性虽然是比战前大大提高了，但对战后新形势的认识，对以美帝国主义为首的国际反动阵营的斗争，显然是不够的。在四年后的今天，形势却已经大变了。
    领导保卫世界和平的社会主义苏联，它的国力在四年中有了进一步的提高。现在苏联不但已恢复了战争的创伤，而且生产力已超过了德国法西斯侵犯苏联前的一九四○年的水平。今年六月份工业每日平均总产量，已超过一九四○年百分之四十一，接近战后新五年计划最后一年——一九五○年的水平，五年计划四年完成的口号很快就将成为事实。同时，苏联的和平外交政策，愈加获得了世界人民的拥护，为和平而奋斗的人类的伟大领袖斯大林自今年年初两次宣示苏联坚定不移的和平政策以后，愈来愈多的人们都在这个政策的周围团结起来了。苏联的更趋强大，和世界愈来愈多的人们对苏联的热烈支持，这就迫使帝国主义不得不采取与苏联恢复谈判的策略，重开自一九四七年十一月起停顿已一年有半的外长会议，并使外长会议获得了若干成就。目前，美帝国主义虽一面加紧备战，但一面却不得不仍硬着头皮继续和苏联谈判。这个事实正是苏联强大、美国软弱的最好说明。
    欧洲各新民主主义国家正在继续巩固和壮大。波、捷、保、罗、匈等国已结束了战后初期国内政治生活中，由于帝国主义及其走狗的破坏活动，而发生的某些不稳定的状态。这些国家的工人阶级，一年来已胜利地完成了从自己队伍中清除了帝国主义代理人的右翼社会党分子，建立起单一的工人阶级政党。这些国家的地主、资产阶级的反动渣滓，其叛国阴谋已被镇压，并被从政治舞台上扫荡下去。共产主义的工人阶级的政党在思想上、政治上和组织上都已增强，并已确定地成为这些国家的强有力的领导力量。这些国家由于苏联的友谊帮助和互相团结合作，已从战争的创伤中恢复过来。他们的恢复和发展经济的计划，正顺利的完成和超过，经济生活正蒸蒸日上。
    以法意人民为首的欧洲资本主义国家的人民民主力量，以及美国和拉丁美洲的人民民主力量，也正在发展。法国和意大利人民，坚毅地迎击了有马歇尔计划之助的法意反动派的进攻，基本上巩固了已得的阵地，并逐步地向前发展。英国的工人运动，随着工党政府媚美外交的暴露和经济危机的煎迫，正逐渐脱离工党右翼领袖的影响。例如，在最近举行的工党第八十一届大会上，反对工党右翼领袖所执行的反动政策的票数，已大为增加，有一百零一万七千票反对退出世界工人阶级联合会，有二百七十六万票要求由工会会员担任各国有化工业局的工会代表。美国人民虽然处在反动派的卑鄙迫害和狂热的战争宣传之下，但仍不避艰难，不怕挫折地一步一步地前进。最近美国进步人民的抗议法西斯分子袭击罗伯逊音乐会的暴行，便是这种坚持不懈的斗争的良好表现。这就使得这些资产阶级统治的国家在经济危机之外，又为日益严重的政治危机所笼罩。
    由于亚洲殖民地半殖民地人民的觉醒，也由于苏联和欧洲各国人民牵制了帝国主义反动集团的力量，整个亚洲的伟大的民族解放运动不断高涨，并且取得了重大的胜利。这是战后国际形势的重要特点之一。占亚洲人口近半、世界人口四分之一的中国人民，打败了获得美帝国主义五十九万万美元援助的国民党反动派，并很快就要取得全国的胜利。这是苏联十月社会主义革命胜利以来世界上的第三个大胜利。
