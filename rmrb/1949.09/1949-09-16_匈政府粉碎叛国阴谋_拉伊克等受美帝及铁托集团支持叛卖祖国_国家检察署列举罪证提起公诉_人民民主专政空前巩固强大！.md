Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 15th—According to TASS from Budapest: On the 6th, the Hungarian State Procuratorate filed a public prosecution with the People's Court regarding the espionage and treason case of former Hungarian Foreign Minister Rajk and his accomplices. On the 11th, Hungarian newspapers published the full text of the lengthy indictment. The indictment details materials that have been investigated and verified, confirming the crimes of the traitor Rajk and others in long-term betrayal of the people's democratic motherland and conspiracy to usurp power. Some evidence shows that the activities of Rajk and others were commanded by and supported by the espionage agencies of US imperialism and the Yugoslav Tito clique. The scope of the traitors' activities included organizing espionage networks, selling state secrets, and even secretly developing armed forces, assassinating government leaders such as Rakosi, subverting the government, usurping power, and changing the national system. Their ultimate goal was to enable the Tito clique to control Hungary, thereby restoring imperialist rule in Hungary.

The State Procuratorate charged eight people, including Rajk, with the following crimes: Former Hungarian National Assembly member, Hungarian Communist Party Politburo member, former Minister of Interior, Minister of Foreign Affairs Laszlo Rajk, guilty of war crimes and anti-people crimes, a national criminal; former Hungarian Deputy Minister of Defense George Palffy, a national criminal; Yugoslav Chargé d'Affaires Lazar Brankov, incitement to assassination; former Hungarian National Assembly member, Hungarian Communist Party Personnel Minister Tibor Szonyi, a national criminal; Andras Szalai, war crimes, a national criminal; former Hungarian Gendarmerie Captain Police Colonel Bela Korondi; former Hungarian National Assembly member, Director of the Broadcasting Administration Paul Justus, a national criminal; the above seven are guilty of leading an organization aimed at overthrowing the democratic national system; Hungarian citizen Milan Ognjenovic, a national criminal.

The indictment lists Rajk's and others' treasonous acts as follows:

As early as 1932 to 1934, Rajk was employed by the Hungarian Police Bureau and repeatedly reported and destroyed communist organizations among workers. Later, he was sent to Czechoslovakia, Spain, and France to spy on the activities of the Hungarian Communist Party abroad. In France, he came into contact with US intelligence chief Field and was sent back to Hungary. After returning to Hungary, he was commanded by Peter Hain, the political police chief of the Szalasi era. Due to Rajk's reports, Communist Party Secretary Zoltan Schoenherz was arrested and executed, and Rosa was killed. Later, Rajk served as the captain of the Horthy secret police intelligence team. At the end of 1945, Rajk returned to Hungary disguised as a persecuted communist, and successively deceived his way into positions such as secretary of the Budapest Party organization of the Hungarian Communist Party, member of parliament, Minister of Interior, and Minister of Foreign Affairs, continuing his espionage activities. According to Rajk's own confession, he regularly and systematically informed US spies of everything in the Hungarian Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

Rajk Colludes with the Tito Clique and US Spies
Organizes Espionage Networks, Sells State Secrets, Conspires to Assassinate Government Leaders, Usurps Power

Due to Tito's betrayal, US imperialism attempted to win the people's democratic countries over to their side with Tito's help. According to Rajk's confession, Yugoslav Interior Minister Rankovic once told him: "The people's democratic countries must unite with Yugoslavia and must take Tito as their leader." To this end, the intelligence agencies of the United States, Yugoslavia, and other imperialist countries used every means to support Rajk. At the beginning of 1945, Tito's official representatives and diplomatic representatives began to establish an intelligence network in Hungary, obtaining information through Rajk and providing it to the United States. In 1946, Allen Dulles, head of the European branch of the US intelligence organization Strategic Services, dispatched Szonyi, and Yugoslavia dispatched Palffy to serve as Rajk's assistants. Rajk and Szonyi placed spy personnel from the United States, Yugoslavia, Britain, France, and other countries into Hungarian state organs, political parties, and people's organizations. Palffy, on the other hand, placed fascist military officers in the Hungarian army. Through the Ministry of Interior and other relationships, Rajk and others spread influence among women, students, youth, and even trade unions. Rajk's organization developed together with Tito's spy organization in Hungary. According to Brankov, the former Yugoslav Chargé d'Affaires in Hungary, due to the expansion of the Yugoslav spy organization in Hungary, Yugoslav Interior Minister Rankovic was able, in accordance with Tito's plan, to issue specific instructions through the spy network to subvert the Hungarian government and change the Hungarian national system. When Tito visited Hungary in December 1947, he was preparing to implement this plan. On his way back to his country, Tito stayed on the Yugoslav-Hungarian border for a day under the pretext of hunting. At this time, Rankovic summoned Rajk and instructed him to rely on the army, police, and chauvinist elements and petty-bourgeois forces in state organs to prepare to usurp power.

In 1948, Rajk learned that the Information Bureau of the European Communist Parties would expose Tito's rebellion and immediately notified Tito. In October of the same year, Rajk and Rankovic held secret talks. Rankovic presented a new plan personally drafted by Tito, proposing three tasks in the new situation created after the publication of the Information Bureau's resolution: (1) Mobilize the Yugoslav people against the Soviet Union; (2) Strengthen anti-Soviet forces in the people's democratic countries and pull these countries to the side of imperialism; (3) Use the differences between the Soviet Union and the United States and Britain on international issues. The plan stipulated that the Yugoslav people should be told that Yugoslavia's five-year plan could not be realized and that the promise to raise the living standards of the masses could not be fulfilled, and that the Soviet Union should be held responsible, so as to cultivate hatred for the Soviet Union and pave the way for Tito's tendency toward Western countries. In Hungary, a movement should be started to attack Rakosi as a revisionist, saying that he was trying to divide the Yugoslav territory in the Hungarian residential area of the South Border. Yugoslavia would then cooperate to provoke border incidents, blaming Hungary, and using this as an excuse, Yugoslav troops wearing Hungarian military uniforms, gendarmes from the British and American occupied zones of Austria, Szalasi elements, and Horthy elements would enter Hungary from Yugoslavia, implement military intervention in Hungary, and occupy part of the territory by force. Tito's plan also included assassinating Hungarian leaders Rakosi, Farkas, and Gero. Rankovic said: Assassinations should be carried out in various ways, such as one person "committing suicide" and another "dying of illness," and appropriate explanations must be made. The new government of Hungary after the coup d'état, drafted by Tito, would have Rajk as Prime Minister, Anton Rob, the head of Yugoslavia's intelligence agency "UDBA" in Hungary and former secretary of the Yugoslav People's Democratic Alliance in Hungary, as Minister of Interior, and Palffy as Minister of Defense. The condition for exchange was that Hungary's domestic and foreign policies and military issues must be coordinated with Yugoslavia's interests, and Hungarian industry must make certain sacrifices to complete Yugoslavia's economic plan. Rankovic instructed Rajk to rely on Catholic reactionaries and rich peasants like Tito, and would provide Rajk with military experts to overthrow the government. Rajk accepted Tito's instructions and returned to Budapest to carry out preparations with Palffy and Szonyi. Rankovic also sent two veteran political assassins, Ivanovic and Ujkic, to Hungary as diplomats, giving them the mission of assassinating Rakosi.

All these plans were crushed by the Hungarian government's suppression. Rajk and his gang were dismissed from their posts, and in mid-May the Hungarian government arrested the conspirators.

Palffy was already a spy for Yugoslav intelligence in 1945; he regularly sent secret documents and intelligence of the Hungarian army to Brankov, the Yugoslav Chargé d'Affaires in Hungary. He cooperated with Rajk, and his task was to prepare an armed rebellion in the army. After Rajk accepted Rankovic's instructions in October 1948, Palffy drafted a written military rebellion plan, preparing to assign ten battalions to seize the Party Central Committee, radio station, post office, and industrial centers in various provinces. He also drew up a plan to assassinate government leaders. After the incident was exposed, he destroyed the plan.

Brankov was Rankovic's main agent in Hungary. For several years, he had maintained contact with Rajk, Palffy, and others, guided Yugoslav intelligence work in Hungary, and engaged in subverting the Republic of Hungary. He committed the crime of incitement to assassination by instructing Borov, a Yugoslav intelligence agent and Yugoslav Press Attaché in Hungary, to kill Milos Moic, one of the leaders of Yugoslavs in Hungary who supported the resolution of the Communist Information Bureau.

Szonyi organized a group of Hungarian Trotskyites in Switzerland in 1938, and then accepted the orders of US intelligence chiefs Field and Allen Dulles. Later, he returned to Hungary via Yugoslavia, occupied key positions, and placed many spy personnel in state organs. He regularly sent secret intelligence on the domestic political and economic situation to Yugoslav and US intelligence agencies respectively. In 1946, Szonyi was ordered by Dulles to be led by Rajk, and later conspired with Rajk to subvert the government. The above-mentioned acts constitute the crime of organizing to overthrow the government of the People's Republic of Hungary.

Szalai was a police intelligence agent as early as 1935, traveling between Yugoslavia and Hungary. In 1942, he sold out the leading organs of the Communist Youth League, including Antal Juzasz and five others. In 1944, he reported the escape plan of South Hungarian political prisoners in the Szatoraljaujhely prison, causing sixty-four prisoners to be executed. According to Brankov, Szalai had contact with Rankovic and "UDBA" throughout his life. He sent the draft of Hungary's border defense work and its annotations, secret decisions of the Council of Ministers, etc. to the Yugoslav intelligence agencies. He placed Hungarian intelligence personnel in state institutions and became one of the rebel leaders who conspired to subvert the government.

Korondi accepted the orders of Rajk and Palffy to organize an armed rebellion, preparing to lead an army composed of Horthy officers to seize Budapest and abduct leaders such as Rakosi.

Justus was an old Trotskyist. Since 1932, he had served as a Hungarian political police intelligence agent. He provided Yugoslavia with intelligence on Hungarian political parties. Tito attached great importance to him and assigned a special person to contact him. Justus also had contact with Frank Casaux, the cultural attaché of the French Embassy in Hungary, and provided him with information on Hungarian political parties, radio organizations, administrative and technical issues.

Ognjenovic served as Anton Rob's spy in 1946, recruiting intelligence agents for Rob, selling Hungarian political intelligence, and obtaining monetary rewards.

The indictment concludes that the above-mentioned charges establish that Rajk and his accomplices established a group with the aim of subverting the Hungarian people's democracy guaranteed by the constitution, eliminating Hungarian independence, and subjecting the country to imperialist enslavement. They attempted to achieve their goals by relying on the military support of the Yugoslav Tito clique. Behind Rajk stood US imperialism and its lackeys—the former Szalasi fascists and Horthy officers, who wanted to sell out the Hungarian people and thereby destroy all our achievements of liberation and rejuvenation. Their crimes have been proven by all the materials, and the prosecution against them is legally sound.

　　匈政府粉碎叛国阴谋
  　拉伊克等受美帝及铁托集团支持叛卖祖国 
    国家检察署列举罪证提起公诉  人民民主专政空前巩固强大！
    【新华社北平十五日电】据塔斯社布达佩斯讯：匈牙利国家检察署六日就匈前外交部长拉伊克及其同谋的间谍叛国案，向人民法庭提起公诉，十一日匈报纸全文发表长篇起诉书。起诉书详举业已调查属实的材料，证实叛贼拉伊克等长期进行叛卖人民民主祖国，阴谋篡夺政权的罪行。若干证据显示：拉伊克等的活动系受命于美国帝国主义及南斯拉夫铁托集团的间谍机关且受他们的支持。叛贼的活动范围包括组织间谍网，出卖国家秘密，直到秘密发展武装，刺杀政府领袖拉科西等人，颠覆政府，篡夺政权，改变国家体制，其终极目的则为使铁托集团能以控制匈牙利，从而恢复帝国主义在匈牙利的统治。
    国家检察署控告拉伊克等八人，他们的罪名为：前匈牙利国民议会议员、匈共政治局委员、前内政部长、外交部长拉兹洛·拉伊克，犯有战争罪及反人民罪，为国事犯；匈前国防部副部长乔治·巴尔费，国事犯；南斯拉夫代办拉萨尔·布兰科夫，暗杀教唆罪；匈前国民议会议员、匈共人事部长提波尔·佐恩尼，国事犯；安德拉斯·萨莱，战争罪，国事犯；匈前宪兵队长警察上校贝拉·科隆第；匈前国民议会议员、广播管理处主任保罗·尤斯图斯，国事犯；以上七名均犯领导以推翻民主国家制度为目的之组织罪；匈公民米兰·奥格涅诺维区，国事犯。
    起诉书列举拉伊克等的叛国行为如下：
    拉伊克早在一九三二年至一九三四年，便受匈牙利警察局雇用，接连告发破坏工人中的共产党组织，其后他被派到捷克、西班牙、法国，刺探匈牙利共产党在国外的活动。在法国，他和美国特务头子费尔德发生了联系，被派回匈牙利，返匈后他受查拉绥时代的政治警察头子彼特·哈因的指挥。由于拉伊克的告发，共产党书记佐尔丹·舍恩赫兹被捕处死，罗萨被杀。其后拉伊克又为霍尔梯秘密警察谍报队队长。一九四五年底拉伊克伪装被迫害的共产党人的面目回到匈牙利，先后骗取了匈共布达佩斯党组织的书记、议会议员、内政部长、外交部长等职位，继续进行其间谍活动。据拉伊克自己供称：他经常而有系统地使美国间谍获悉匈内政部和外交部的一切情况。
    拉伊克勾结铁托集团和美国特务
    组织间谍网、出卖国家秘密阴谋刺杀政府领袖篡夺政权
    由于铁托的叛变，美帝国主义企图通过铁托的帮助，把人民民主国家争取到他们那一边去，根据拉伊克的供词，南斯拉夫内政部长兰科维奇曾对他说：“人民民主国家必须和南斯拉夫团结，并须以铁托为其首领”。为此目的，美、南及其他帝国主义国家的谍报机关，曾用一切方法支持拉伊克。一九四五年初，铁托的官方代表及外交代表开始在匈牙利建立谍报网，即通过拉伊克取得情报，并以之供给美国。一九四六年，美国谍报组织战略服务处欧洲分处处长艾伦·杜勒斯派遣佐恩尼，南国派遣巴尔费充作拉伊克的助手，拉伊克和佐恩尼把美、南、英、法等国的间谍人员安插进匈牙利国家机关、政党及人民团体中去，巴尔费则在匈牙利军队中安插法西斯军官。拉伊克等通过内政部和其他关系，在妇女、学生、青年以至职工会中散布影响。拉伊克的组织与铁托在匈的间谍组织一同发展着，据前南国驻匈代办布兰科夫供称：由于南斯拉夫在匈间谍组织的扩大，南内政部长兰科维奇乃得依照铁托计划，通过间谍网发布颠覆匈政府及改变匈国家体制的具体训令。一九四七年十二月铁托访问匈牙利，即在准备执行这个计划。在铁托返国途中，借口打猎在南匈边境逗留一天，这时兰科维奇曾召见拉伊克，训令他依靠军队警察及国家机关里的沙文主义分子和小资产阶级力量，以准备篡取政权。
    一九四八年拉伊克获悉欧洲共产党情报局将揭露铁托的叛逆，即以之通知铁托。同年十月拉伊克和兰科维奇举行了密谈，兰科维奇出示一项铁托亲拟的新计划，提出情报局决议发表后所造成的新形势下的三项任务，即：（一）动员南国人民反苏；（二）加强人民民主国家的反苏力量，并把这些国家拉到帝国主义方面去；（三）利用苏联与美英在国际问题上的分歧。计划规定要向南斯拉夫人民宣传南国五年计划之不能实现，以及提高群众生活水平之诺言不能实现，应由苏联负责，以培养对苏联的仇恨，而为铁托的倾向西方国家铺平道路。在匈牙利则要开始一个运动，攻击拉科西是修正主义，并说他企图分割南境匈牙利居民区的南斯拉夫领土，南斯拉夫就配合挑起边境事件，归咎于匈牙利，并以此为借口，由穿着匈牙利军制服的南斯拉夫军队、奥境英美占领区的宪兵、查拉绥分子与霍尔梯分子自南斯拉夫开入匈牙利，实行对匈军事干涉并武装占领部分领土。铁托的计划还包括刺杀匈牙利领袖拉科西、法卡斯和格罗等人。兰科维奇说：刺杀要用多样的方法，譬如这一个人“自杀”，另一个“因病死亡”，并须作出适当解释。铁托所拟定的匈牙利政变后的新政府，由拉伊克任总理，南斯拉夫在匈谍报机关“尤巴”的首领、前匈境南斯拉夫人民民主联盟书记安东·罗勃任内政部长，巴尔费任国防部长，其交换条件是：匈牙利内外政策及军队问题必须与南斯拉夫的利益协调，匈工业必须作若干牺牲以完成南斯拉夫的经济计划。兰科维奇训令拉伊克要象铁托那样地依靠天主教反动派及富农，并将供给拉伊克以推翻政府的军事专家。拉伊克接受了铁托的训令，返回布达佩斯和巴尔费、佐恩尼进行准备工作，兰科维奇又派两名政治刺客老手伊凡诺维奇和尤伊基奇到匈牙利作外交官，给他们刺杀拉科西的使命。
    这一切计划均由匈政府的镇压而告粉碎，拉伊克和他的党徒被解除职务，五月中旬匈政府逮捕了阴谋叛国者。
    巴尔费在一九四五年已是南斯拉夫情报机关的间谍；他定期把匈军的秘密文件和情报送给南斯拉夫驻匈代办布兰科夫。他和拉伊克合作，任务是在军队中准备叛变武装。一九四八年十月拉伊克接受兰科维奇的训令后，巴尔费拟定一项书面军事叛乱计划，准备指派十个营夺取党中央委员会、电台、邮局、各省工业中心。并订出刺杀政府领袖的计划。事迹败露后，他把计划毁掉。
    布兰科夫是兰科维奇在匈的主要代理人，数年以来，他一直和拉伊克、巴尔费等人保持联系，并指导南国在匈谍报工作，从事颠覆匈牙利共和国。他因训令南国谍报员、南驻匈新闻参赞博罗夫去杀死支持共产党情报局决议的匈境南斯拉夫人领袖之一米洛施·莫伊奇而犯暗杀教唆罪。
    佐恩尼曾于一九三八年在瑞士组织匈牙利托洛斯基分子集团，后即接受美国特务头子费尔德和爱伦·杜勒斯的命令，其后经由南斯拉夫返回匈牙利，盘据要津，在国家机关里安插了许多间谍人员。他经常将国内政治与经济情势的秘密情报分别送给南斯拉夫和美国情报处。一九四六年佐恩尼奉杜勒斯命令受拉伊克领导，后与拉伊克合谋颠覆政府。上述行为构成推翻匈牙利人民共和国政府的组织罪。
    萨莱于一九三五年即为警察谍报人员，往来于南斯拉夫与匈牙利之间。一九四二年曾出卖共产主义青年团的领导机关人员安塔尔·尤萨兹等五人，一九四四年在萨托拉辽叶利监狱告发南匈政治犯的越狱计划，使六十四个犯人被处死。据布兰科夫供称：萨莱毕生和兰科维奇及“尤巴”有联系。他把匈牙利边境防御工作草案及其注释，部长会议秘密决定等送给南国谍报机关。他安插匈谍报人员到国家机构中去，并成为密谋颠覆政府的叛变领袖之一。
    科隆第接受拉伊克和巴尔费的命令，组织武装叛变，准备领导由霍尔梯军官组成的军队，夺取布达佩斯，劫持拉科西等领袖。
    尤斯图斯是老托洛斯基分子，一九三二年起即担任匈牙利政治警察谍报员，他供给南斯拉夫以匈国政党的情报，铁托极重视他，指定专人和他联系。尤斯图斯又和法国驻匈公使馆文化参赞佛兰克·茄旭有联系，并供给他匈牙利政党和无线电组织、行政和技术问题的情报。
    奥格涅诺维区一九四六年充安东·罗勃的间谍，给罗勃招募谍报员，出卖匈国政治情报并取得金钱报酬。
    起诉书最后指出，上述罪状确定拉伊克及其同谋建立以颠覆宪法所保证的匈牙利人民民主，消灭匈牙利独立，及使国家受帝国主义奴役为目的的团体。他们企图依靠南斯拉夫铁托集团的武力支持以达到目的。在拉伊克后面站着美国帝国主义及其走狗——前查拉绥法西斯分子和霍尔梯军官，他们要出卖匈牙利人民并从而摧毁我们解放与复兴的一切成就。他们的罪行已被一切材料证明，对他们的起诉是具有法律力量的。
