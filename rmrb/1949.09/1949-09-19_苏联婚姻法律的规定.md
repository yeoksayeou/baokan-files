　　Soviet Marriage Law Regulations
　　Huang Pao
　　Marriage is a problem in China that urgently needs to be solved. We are transforming from a semi-feudal and semi-colonial old society to a new democratic society, and marriages based on "the orders of parents and the words of matchmakers" are absolutely not allowed. Freedom of marriage and autonomy for both men and women are the characteristics of marriage in the new society. To this end, everyone must have a new understanding and a new perspective on marriage. Now, I will introduce some of the provisions of Soviet marriage laws since the October Revolution for your reference.
　　　　I. Principles of Marriage Law
　　After the success of the October Revolution in 1917, the Soviets established a people's government and subsequently promulgated decrees such as "Marriage and Family, Civil Registration of Marriage" in December of the same year. In the autumn of 1918, the Russian Soviet Federative Republic promulgated the "Birth, Marriage, and Death Registration Law and Marriage Family Guarantor Law."
　　The formulation of these laws was first published in newspapers, at gatherings, or at meetings to allow the people to conduct extensive, universal, and open discussions. For example, "Civil Registration of Marriage and Child Registration Procedures" was published in the newspapers of Petrograd. The publication of the "Regulations on Marriage, Family, and Protection of the People" in 1925 went through detailed discussions by people across the country, and opinions were put forward for modification before the legislative body adopted it. In 1936, the new and important draft laws on marriage and family life were also widely discussed by the masses in newspapers, at gatherings, and at meetings before they were passed.
　　The principle behind the formulation of Soviet marriage laws is aimed at combating the unsatisfactory views on marriage in the past. The new law stipulates that both men and women should be regarded as members of the family, and the relationship between the two parties should be built on a completely equal footing. Article 122 of the Soviet Constitution clearly stipulates: "Soviet women have equal rights with men in all aspects of economic, state, cultural, social, and political life."
　　Soviet law regards marriage not only as a personal matter but also as a matter concerning the entire nation. Therefore, the purpose of formulating marriage laws is to proceed from the interests of individuals and the entire society.
　　　　II. Provisions of Marriage Law
　　Before July 8, 1944, the Soviet state recognized unregistered marriages, that is, the actual cohabitation of men and women. Even if it was not registered, it was no longer considered illegal and had the same effect as marriages registered at the registry office, enjoying the same rights.
　　The provisions of the July 8, 1944 decree fundamentally changed this law. Now, only couples who have registered their marriage at the civil affairs bureau's marriage registration office are considered legal in law. Therefore, "de facto marriage" is no longer protected by national law because de facto marriage is a manifestation of a frivolous and careless attitude towards marriage.
　　The Soviet Union implements monogamy. One or both parties who are already married cannot remarry. Early marriage is prohibited, and close relatives are not allowed to marry.
　　Marriage is a voluntary act and must be mutually agreeable to both parties. Soviet law guarantees that every citizen has the right to freely and independently choose their spouse when they reach marriageable age. The two parties are built on a completely equal and truly free foundation. Marriages established by force, intimidation, or coercion will be subject to legal sanctions.
　　Another condition for marriage is the age limit. The marriage age for men and women in most Soviet republics is stipulated to be 18 years old. Only in special circumstances does the local Soviet have the right to reduce the marriage age of women by one year upon the request of the party concerned. In the federal republics of Ukraine, Azerbaijan, etc., women are allowed to marry freely at the age of sixteen due to climate and other conditions.
　　Marriage is only valid if it is within the legal marriage age and both parties are mutually willing. If either or both parties to the marriage are weak-willed or mentally disturbed, marriage is not allowed. Marriage between blood relatives or half-brothers and sisters is not allowed. If one party to the marriage marries a person who has not reached the legal age, he/she will be sentenced to two years of imprisonment. If marrying a person who is not yet mature, the punishment can be increased to eight years.
　　The Soviet Union does not prohibit marriage with foreigners. Any Soviet man or woman can marry a foreigner. The men and women who marry do not lose their Soviet citizenship.
　　When Soviet men and women get married, they have to go to the registry office to register. First, submit a statement to the registry office and inform them of your personal health status and how many times you have been married, and whether you have children. The marriage registration office will then inform the parties concerned of the relevant legal provisions on marriage, explain whether it hinders marriage, and warn the parties concerned of the consequences of false registration. Then, the new couple to be married signs the register, and the registrar testifies. Marriage registration is also recorded on the party's passport.
　　When registering a marriage, the couple can declare to use a common surname, whether it is the same surname as the woman's surname or the same surname as the man's surname, or each use their own surname, which is completely free.
　　After marriage, the choice of residence is freely decided by both parties, without legal restrictions. And both husband and wife have the freedom to choose their own profession and work. The property of the husband and wife is completely equal. The property before marriage still belongs to the individual, and the property acquired after marriage is equally distributed between the two parties. If one spouse dies, the other spouse has the right of first inheritance, and the inherited property cannot be less than that of other heirs.
　　　　III. Provisions of Divorce Law
　　The divorce law was promulgated as early as December 19, 1917. The law declared complete freedom of divorce. This precisely adapted to the requirements of the transition from the old society to the new society at that time.
　　In 1936, it went a step further. The Soviet government believed that it was necessary to adopt measures to prevent a frivolous attitude towards marriage. Therefore, the law stipulates that both parties requesting a divorce must personally go to the registry office to register and must indicate it on their passports before a divorce is allowed.
　　In 1944, the order of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union went a step further. It stipulates that when the reasons for divorce are justified, divorce is not hindered; unjust divorce and a frivolous attitude towards marriage are prohibited by law.
　　The new law stipulates that the divorce must be publicly declared and must be reviewed by the court. Divorce is only allowed if there are sufficient reasons for divorce. And the announcement of the trial of divorce cases must be published in the newspaper.
　　What conditions must be met for a divorce? What kind of reasons are allowed for divorce? Soviet law does not clearly stipulate this. It completely grants the power to approve or reject divorce to the court. The reason is that people's lives are diverse. What is considered a sufficient reason in one case and can constitute a condition for divorce may not be a justified reason in another case.
　　After the court rules for a divorce, the registry office issues a divorce certificate and makes the necessary notes on the passport, which completes the divorce procedure.

　　苏联婚姻法律的规定
    黄抛
    婚姻问题在中国，现在是一个迫切需要解决的问题。我们由半封建半殖民地的旧社会转变到新民主主义的新社会，“父母之命、媒妁之言”的婚姻是根本不许再有。婚姻自由，男女双方自主是新社会婚姻的特征。为此，大家必须对婚姻有新的认识、新的见解。现在介绍一点苏联自十月革命以来婚姻法律规定的情形，作为大家参考。
    　　　　一、婚姻法律的原则
    一九一七年十月革命成功，苏维埃建立了人民政权，接着于同年十二月颁布了“婚姻与家庭、民事登记结婚”等法令。一九一八年秋，俄罗斯苏维埃联邦又颁布了“出生结婚死亡登记法及婚姻家庭保证人法”。
    这些法律的制定，首先发表在报纸上、集会上或会议上，让人民进行广泛地普遍地公开讨论。如“民事登记结婚子女登记手续”，曾在彼得格勒的报纸上发表。一九二五年“关于结婚家庭和保护人民的法规”的发表，经过全国人民详细讨论，提出意见加以修改之后，立法机关才加以采用。一九三六年关于婚后与家庭生活的新的重要的法律草案，也是群众首先在报纸上、集会上、会议上作了广泛的讨论，然后才通过的。
    苏联关于婚姻法律制定的原则，其目的都在于和过去令人不满意的婚姻观点作斗争。新法律规定应视男女皆为家庭的成员，双方关系建筑在完全平等的基础上。苏联宪法一一二条明文规定：“苏联妇女在经济、国家、文化、社会与政治生活一切方面与男子有平等的权利”。
    苏联法律把婚姻问题不只当作是有关个人的私事，而且是当作有关整个国家民族的问题。因此婚姻法律的制定，目的是以个人及整个社会的利益为出发的。
    　　　　二、结婚法律的规定
    在一九四四年七月八日以前，苏联国家承认未经登记的结婚，即男子和女子实际上的同居，即使未经过登记，已不认为是非法，和在登记处登记过的婚姻有同样的效力，得享同样的权利。
    一九四四年七月八日法令的规定，使这个法律有了根本的改变，现在只有经过民政局结婚登记处登记过的夫妻在法律上才算合法。所以“事实上的结婚”已不在国家法律保护之下了。因事实上的结婚是对婚姻的一种轻率马虎态度的表现。
    苏联实行一夫一妻制，当事人之一方或双方已结婚者不能再结婚。早婚是禁止的，近亲属也不准结婚。
    结婚是一种自愿行为，须双方互相情愿，苏联法律保证每一个公民达到结婚年龄时，有权利自由的独立的选择自己的配偶。当事人双方建筑在完全平等与真正自由的基础上。若由于强力、威吓、胁迫方法成立的婚姻，都要受到法律的制裁。
    结婚的另一条件是年龄的限制，苏联大多数的各共和国男女结婚年龄规定为十八岁，只有在特殊情况下地方苏维埃有权应当事人之声请减低妇女结婚年龄一年。在乌克兰、亚塞尔拜然等联邦共和国，则因气候和其他条件关系，规定妇女在十六岁即可自由结婚。
    结婚只有在法定结婚年龄以内，并且当事人双方互相情愿才为有效。若结婚之双方或一方意志薄弱或神经失常时，则不准结婚。血统亲属间或异父或异母兄弟姐妹互相之间，不准结婚。若当事人一方与未达法定年龄的人结婚，要处二年监禁。如与年龄尚未成熟的人结婚，处罚可增到八年。
    苏联并不禁止与外人结婚，任何苏联男女，皆可与外国人结婚。其结婚之男女，并不丧失苏联公民的资格。
    苏联男女结婚时，要到登记处去登记。首先到登记处递上说明书。并告知个人健康状况及第几次结婚，有无子女。结婚登记处，则将有关结婚法律条文告知当事人，说明其是否妨害婚姻，并警告当事人登记虚伪的后果。然后由要结婚的新夫妇双方在登记册上签名，由登记人作证。结婚登记并记入当事人的护照上。
    在登记结婚时，夫妻可以声明用共用的姓，不论是同姓女姓或同姓男姓，或各用自己的姓，都完全自由。
    结婚后对于住所选定，由双方自由决定，无法律限制。并且夫妻双方有选择自己职业与工作的自由。夫妻财产是完全平等的，婚前财产仍归个人所有，婚后所得财产由双方平等分配。夫妻一方死亡，他方有优先继承权，其继承财产不能少于其他继承人。
    　　　　三、离婚法律的规定
    离婚法早在一九一七年十二月十九日即公布，该法律宣布离婚完全自由。这正是适应了当时由旧社会进到新社会的要求。
    一九三六年便进了一步，苏维埃政府认为有必要采用办法阻止对婚姻的轻率态度。于是法律便规定请求离婚者双方必须亲到登记处登记，并须在护照上注明，始准离婚。
    一九四四年苏联最高苏维埃主席团的命令又进了一步。规定离婚理由正当时，对于离婚不加阻挡；不正当的离婚与对婚姻的轻率态度是法律禁止的。
    新法令规定离婚要公开声明，且须经法院审理，认为有充分的离婚理由，才准离婚。并须将审理离婚案件的公告，在报纸上发表。
    离婚须具备什么条件？有什么样的理由才准许离婚？苏联法律并不加以明确规定。它是将批准离婚与否决离婚之权完全授予于法院。其理由是人们生活是多式多样的，在这一案件认为是充分理由而可以构成离婚条件的，而在另一案件则不见得是正当理由。
    法院判决离婚后，登记处发离婚证明书，并在护照上做必要的注明，便算完成离婚手续。
