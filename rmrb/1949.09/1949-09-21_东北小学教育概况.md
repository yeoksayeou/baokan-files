An overview of Primary Education in Northeast China
Zhang Jian

	Over the past three years, the restoration and development of primary education in Northeast China has generally gone through the following process: from "August 15th" to 1946, the entire Northeast was suffering from the attacks of the Kuomintang bandit army and the "Central" bandit rebellion. Most schools were destroyed, and many children were displaced and out of school. At that time, only in areas controlled by the People's Government could schools be reopened. In early 1947, thanks to the initial mobilization of the masses and the gradual elimination of the "Central" bandits, our army began to counterattack, and primary education also developed accordingly, but it had not yet reached the level of the puppet Manchuria. In 1948, the land reform in the old areas was basically completed, and the broad masses of peasants, who had initially turned over politically and economically, enthusiastically demanded to learn culture, and set up schools and sent their children to school using the fruits of their struggle. Rural primary schools not only caught up with the puppet Manchuria, but in some areas even exceeded it, such as in Hejiang Province, which exceeded it by one and a half times. The development of urban primary schools was not as rapid as that of rural primary schools due to housing limitations. In the autumn and winter, with the liberation of the entire Northeast, the restoration of primary schools in the new areas also began. By the end of 1948, according to incomplete statistics from nine provinces and three cities, there were a total of 27,050 primary schools, 55,966 teachers, and 2,165,655 students in the entire Northeast. If we add the rural primary schools in the entire province of Rehe and the province of Liaoxi, it roughly reached the highest level of the most prosperous era of puppet Manchuria (1943).

	In the first semester of 1949, due to the liberation of the entire Northeast and the completion of land reform, production had partially developed. Many worker and peasant parents said: "In the old society, we were poor and couldn't go to school for generations. Now we have turned over! We have food and clothing at home, so we must let our children go to school!" Students from all over the country poured into the schools like a tide. In large and medium-sized cities such as Shenyang, Harbin, Changchun, Jilin, and Anshan, due to the extreme shortage of school buildings, although the schools had already enrolled too many students, they had to implement a two-shift system (half a day of class in rotation) and a four-shift system (only half a day of class every other day). Without desks and chairs, they had to sit on the ground to attend classes. Despite such congestion, many parents still ran to the schools every day to negotiate and repeatedly asked to let their children enter school! Those who were not admitted blamed the government for not running enough schools. During the preparatory meeting of the People's Congress in Harbin in June, there were about 160 proposals on education, most of which required the government to find ways to increase the number of schools to solve the problem of their children's enrollment.

	According to preliminary statistics in May, there are currently 36,061 primary schools, 82,761 teachers, and 3,692,749 students in the entire Northeast. There are approximately 6,030,756 school-age children in the entire Northeast, and the enrollment rate is approximately 38.5 percent. The characteristics of school development are: the masses automatically establish schools and then request government leadership to manage them, mostly with spontaneity; there are more rural schools than urban schools because urban schools are restricted by school buildings; according to materials from Nenjiang, Rehe, Shenyang, and Anshan provinces and cities, children from worker and peasant basic masses account for approximately 89.8 percent of the enrolled children, and children from landlord and rich peasant families account for only 6.6 percent. According to statistics from five provinces and three cities, fourth-grade students account for approximately 7.1 percent, and sixth-grade students account for approximately 1.9 percent. Based on this, it is estimated that by this winter vacation, there will be approximately 262,195 primary school graduates and 69,162 higher primary school graduates in the entire Northeast. It is estimated that more than 30,000 higher primary school graduates will enter secondary schools next spring. Currently, on average, there is one primary school for every 1,100 people in the entire Northeast, and one in eleven people is enrolled in school. The number of primary school students in Northeast China has exceeded that of puppet Manchuria by 64.75 percent and that of the Kuomintang-ruled period by 158 percent.

	Over the past three years, primary education in Northeast China has not only developed greatly in quantity, but also fundamentally changed to become New Democratic in terms of educational content, that is, educational nature. We have thoroughly abolished the old textbooks and teaching materials of Japanese imperialism's enslavement education and the Kuomintang's feudal fascist obscurantist education, and rewritten a set of new textbooks and teaching materials that reflect the requirements of people's revolution and production construction. In the process of developing and improving primary education, striving for, uniting, and transforming the vast number of primary school teachers is a fundamental link. In terms of leadership, on the one hand, we have planned to conduct training during the holidays. The old areas have conducted five or six sessions, and the new areas have generally conducted them last winter. We also insist on and lead the two-hour study during the in-service period to improve teachers' political awareness and cultural and professional level. On the other hand, all localities resolutely implement the Northeast Bureau Political Committee's guidelines on primary education and the policy on intellectuals, and correct the "left" deviation of once extensively purging primary school teachers from landlord and rich peasant backgrounds during the land reform, which is conducive to the development of primary education. We have not only abolished corporal punishment and the Kuomintang's reactionary disciplinary system, but also overcome the tendency of extreme democratization during the land reform. We advocate respecting teachers and loving students, inspiring students to consciously abide by discipline, and using criticism and self-criticism to educate students. Many teachers have begun to use democratic enlightenment, collective mutual assistance, and object teaching methods. Rural teachers have also begun to pay attention to researching multi-grade teaching methods. Organizing teachers to study textbooks and teaching materials, observe each other's teaching, and exchange teaching experiences by city or district is an effective method for researching business. The formal teaching system of commencement, examination, promotion, graduation, and holidays has now begun to be established. This has improved the effectiveness of teaching. Some formal complete primary schools in towns and cities, such as the third-grade students of Jiamusi City Complete Primary School, have caught up with the level of the fourth grade in puppet Manchuria. They can write and use about 1,000 characters, write simple letters and notes, and articles of 300 to 400 words, and can calculate addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of integers and decimals. The level of the Chinese language course for students in the semi-old area of Jilin City Complete Primary School has also exceeded that of the puppet Manchuria and the Kuomintang-ruled period. Therefore, the parents of the students are happy to say: "Today's schools are really useful. Studying for one year is as good as studying for two years in puppet Manchuria!" In addition, rural primary school teachers and students also use their spare time and holidays to assist district and village cadres in promoting mass production, making plans, keeping work accounts, running blackboard newspapers, writing newsletters, performing plays for the masses on rainy days, and encouraging diligent production to get rich. Actively run literacy classes, reading classes, winter schools, and use the Spring Festival to perform Yangko dances to support the army and give preferential treatment to families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs. Urban primary schools also actively participate in mass current affairs policy propaganda, education and cultural and recreational activities, etc. In short, our primary schools are not only places to educate the children of workers and peasants and cultivate new citizens, but also fortresses of mass cultural life, and they are constantly striving to improve the political awareness and cultural level of the liberated working people.

	However, it cannot be denied that there are still many problems in the primary education work in Northeast China: The first is the funding problem. The general treatment of teachers is relatively low, and the salaries of rural teachers are both low and often in arrears. Urban school buildings are extremely scarce, and both urban and rural equipment is very poor, and office expenses are very difficult. Although the educational level of teachers in the new areas is higher, their political and ideological level is relatively poor. Although teachers in the old areas are slightly better politically, their educational level is too low. For example, among the 382 teachers in Jining County, Songjiang Province, 123 have a higher primary school education or lower, accounting for more than 33 percent. The mobility of teachers is also very high, and good teachers are being transferred away one after another (accounting for about one-fifth to one-tenth of the total), which has a great impact on the work. The leadership is also not sound enough. For example, in the 27 cities and counties in Rehe Province, there are only 16 education section chiefs. Not only is the number small, but the quality is also poor, and they are also engaged in other work. Their own work lacks planning and is busy with affairs. Many cadres are incompetent due to their low educational level, which makes it difficult for the lower levels to report to the higher levels, and it is also difficult for the higher-level instructions to be delivered to the lower levels, forming a disconnection between the upper and lower levels. Furthermore, most of the textbooks are outdated and unsuitable. In the past, the main content of textbooks was war and land reform, and there was less reflection on production and construction (especially for urban industry), more rural than urban, more political than cultural, and more adult-like without paying attention to whether it is suitable for children's psychology or interests. The problems in the progress and arrangement are: the early grades are too light, the higher grades are too heavy, and the middle grades are a bit chaotic. In addition, there is still a guerrilla style in the teaching system. All of the above are problems that urgently need to be resolved rationally.

	In the future, primary education in Northeast China must implement the instructions of the Northeast Bureau - to consolidate and improve it on the existing basis. We should rationally solve the funding problem, appropriately improve the treatment and social status of teachers; improve the quality of teachers, which is the main link in improving the quality of primary schools; strengthen administrative leadership, mainly by equipping a sufficient number of county and district education administrative cadres who are quite competent; re-compile a set of primary school textbooks and teacher reference materials according to the new situation, overcome the wartime, rural, adult-like, and chaotic arrangement problems of the past, and appropriately coordinate politics and culture; establish a formal teaching system and overcome the guerrilla habits.

	As far as I know, the Northeast Education Department has already begun to study how to solve the above problems, and will soon convene the fourth education conference to specifically study and solve the above problems.

　　东北小学教育概况
    张健
    三年来，东北小学教育的恢复和发展，大致经过这样的过程：“八一五”至一九四六年间，那时全东北因正遭受着国民党匪军的进攻和“中央”胡子叛乱的影响，大部分学校遭了破坏，许多儿童流离失学；当时，仅在人民政府控制的地区，才能复学上课。一九四七年初，由于群众初步发动，“中央”胡子次第肃清，我军开始反攻，小学教育也随之有了发展，但尚未达到伪满水平。一九四八年，老区土改基本上完成，在政治上经济上获得初步翻身的广大农民，热烈的要求学习文化，纷纷利用斗争果实设立学校，送子女入学，农村小学不但赶上了伪满，有些地区还超过了，例如合江省就超过一倍半。城镇小学因受房舍限制，发展数不如农村之多。秋冬间，随着东北全境解放，新区小学也开始着手恢复。到一九四八年底，据九省三市不完全的统计，全东北共有小学二七、○五○校，教师五五、九六六人，学生二、一六五、六五五名，若再加上热河全省及辽西省农村小学数，大致已达到伪满极盛年代（一九四三年）的最高水平。
    一九四九年上学期，因东北全境解放，土改已经完成，生产有了部分发展。许多工农家长说：“旧社会咱们受穷，几辈子没念上书；如今翻身啦！家里有吃有穿，这可要让孩子上学去！”各地学生都象潮水似的向学校里涌进来。沈、哈、长、吉、安等大中城市，因校舍奇缺，虽然学校已招生太多，只好实行二部制（一日中轮流上半天课）和四部制（隔天才能轮到上半天课）的办法，没有桌凳，只好坐在地下上课。这样拥挤法，许多家长仍天天跑到学校里交涉，再三要求让其子女入学！不得入学的就责备着政府学校办得太少了。六月间哈市召开人民代表大会筹备会，关于教育方面的提案约有一百六十余件之多，其中多半要求政府设法增设学校，解决他们子女入学问题。
    现据五月份初步统计，全东北共有小学校三六、○六一处，教师八二、七六一名，学生三、六九二、七四九名。全东北约有学龄儿童六、○三○、七五六名，入学儿童约占百分之三十八点五。学校发展的特点是：群众自动设立再请求政府领导办理，多半带着自发性；农村多于城市，因城市受着校舍的限制；根据嫩、热、沈、鞍省市材料，入学儿童工农基本群众子女约占百分之八十九点八，地富子女仅占百分之六点六。又据五省三市的统计，四年级学生约占百分之七点一，六年级学生约占百分之一点九，以这来推算，到今年寒假，全东北约有初小毕业生二六二、一九五名，高小毕业生六九、一六二名。估计明春将有三万余高小毕业生升入中等学校。现在平均起来，全东北每一千一百余人就有一处小学，十一人中就有一人入学。现在东北小学生数已超过伪满百分之六十四点七五；超过国民党统治时期百分之一百五十八。
    三年来，东北小学教育不但是在数量上大大发展了，而且在教育内容上即教育性质上，也根本的变为新民主主义的了。我们彻底废除了日本帝国主义奴化教育及国民党封建法西斯愚民教育的旧课本教材，重编一套反映人民革命和生产建设要求的新课本教材。在发展和改进小学教育过程中，争取、团结、改造广大的小学教师是基本环节，领导上一方面有计划的利用假期进行讲习训练，老区办过五六次，新区去冬也都普遍办理过；并坚持和领导平日在职期间两小时的学习，借此来提高教师的政治觉悟和文化与业务水平；另一方面，就是各地坚决贯彻东北局政委会关于小学教育方针及知识分子政策，纠正土改期间一度大批清洗地富出身的小学教师之左的偏差，这就有利于小学教育的发展。我们不但废除了体罚及国民党反动的训导制度，同时也克服土改时期极端民主化的偏向；提倡尊师爱生，启发学生自觉地遵守纪律，运用批评和自我批评来教育学生。许多教师开始运用民主启发、集体互助和实物教学法；农村教师也开始注意研究复式教学法；以市或区为单位来组织教师研究课本教材，互相观摩教学，交流教学经验，这是研究业务有效的方法。现已开始建立始业、考试、升级、毕业、假期等正规的教学制度。这样就使教学成效随之提高。有些城镇正规完小如佳木斯市完小三年级生，已赶上伪满四年级的程度；他们会写会用一千来字，能写简单的书信便条和三四百字的文章，会算整小数加减乘除；半老区吉林市完小学生国语课程度也都超过伪满及国民党统治时期，故学生家长高兴的说：“如今的学校真顶事，念一年赶上伪满念二年”！此外，农村小学师生尚利用课余假日，协助区村干部推动群众生产，订计划，记工帐，办理黑板报，写通讯，雨天给群众演戏，鼓励勤劳生产，发家致富。积极办识字班，读报班，冬学，利用春节扭秧歌，拥军优属。城镇小学也同样积极参加群众的时事政策宣传教育和文娱活动等。总之我们的小学不但是教育工农子女培养新国民的场所，而且还是群众文化生活的堡垒，它不断的努力来提高翻身的劳动人民政治觉悟与文化水平。
    但不可讳言的，东北小学教育工作，目前仍然存在着许多问题：首先是经费问题，现在教员一般的待遇都较低，农村教师，薪金既低又常拖欠；城市校舍奇缺，城乡设备皆很差，办公杂支经费很困难。新区教师文化程度虽较高，但政治思想水平较差，老区教师政治上虽稍好些，但文化程度太低，如松江省鸡宁县三八二名教师中，有一二三名是高小以下的程度，占百分之三十三强；教师的流动性也很大，好的教师都被陆续的调走（约占总数五分之一至十分之一），对工作影响颇大。领导上也不够健全，如热河省二十七个市县仅有十六个教育科长，不但数量少，质量也差，还搞其他工作，本身工作缺乏计划，忙于事务，许多干部因文化程度低不能称职，故造成下情难于上告，上级指示也难于下达，形成上下脱节。再就是教材已多半过时不适用，过去教材主要内容就是战争和土改，对于生产建设（尤其是对于城市工业）反映较少，农村多于城市，政治多于文化，成人气重而不注意是否适合儿童心理或兴趣，在进度和排列上的毛病是：初年级太轻，高年级太重，中年级有点乱。此外则是在教学制度上仍存在游击作风。以上种种，这都是急待获得合理解决的问题。
    今后东北小学教育要贯彻东北局的指示——在现有的基础上加以巩固和提高，就应该合理的解决经费问题，适当的提高教师待遇和社会地位；提高师资质量，这是提高小学质量的主要环节；加强行政领导，主要是配备相当称职的足够数量的县区教育行政干部；根据新的形势重编一套小学课本教材和教员参考材料，克服过去那种战时化、农村化、成人化和编排上的混乱毛病，使政治和文化适当地配合；建立正规的教学制，克服游击习气。
    据笔者所知，东北教育部早已开始着手研究如何解决上述问题，不久将召开第四次教育会议，具体研究解决上述诸问题的办法。
