　　A Visit with Representatives to the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference
  　People's Writer Zhao Shuli
    Rong An

    Zhao Shuli, the novelist who enjoys great fame in New China, is one of the representatives from the literary and art circles attending the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

    When the reporter met him, Zhao Shuli was still wearing the old cotton-padded coat he had brought from the Taihang Mountains. On his desk, besides office supplies and his pipe and tobacco, were letters from members of the Victory Theater Troupe sent from Shanxi. This troupe was an old rural opera troupe that Zhao Shuli personally cultivated and reformed during the Anti-Japanese War. In that long letter, the members affectionately reported to their Teacher Zhao (as they called him in the letter) about their recent theater activities in the countryside. During the conversation, Zhao Shuli would occasionally pick up his beloved sanxian and play a little tune, and sometimes insert his opinions on the reform of old operas and the creation of novels. Diligence, simplicity, connection with the masses, love, and loyalty to his own cause are precisely the valuable qualities of Comrade Zhao Shuli.

    Comrade Zhao Shuli is a typical writer who comes from the masses and goes back to the masses. Because he was born in the countryside, and especially because he lived in an oppressed and poor peasant family since childhood, he is most familiar with the countryside, especially with the oppression of peasants and how the feudal class exploited and oppressed them. Because he personally experienced the suffering of oppression and exploitation by feudal landlords, he developed an extreme hatred for the feudal class and an infinite love and sympathy for the peasant class. This emotion is fully expressed in his works, so his works can arouse class resonance among the masses and are welcomed by the broad masses. Taking his masterpieces "Xiao Erhei's Marriage" and "Li Youcai's Rhymes" as examples, in the former Taihang Liberated Area, they were the two most widely sold pamphlets. Almost all the theater troupes in the Taihang countryside adapted these two pamphlets into scripts and staged them.

    At the same time, this class feeling of Comrade Zhao Shuli, after years of cultivation by the Communist Party, has been guided onto the correct path of class struggle. Therefore, it is often manifested in Comrade Zhao Shuli's works in the form of class struggle, and this struggle often correctly reflects the Party's policies and lines, and grasps the art of class struggle.

    Look! The author describes the younger generation in "Li Youcai's Rhymes" and the new peasants such as Tiesuo, Leng Yuan, and Baigou in "Changes in Li Village" with such warmth, while exposing the insidious, cunning, and unscrupulous landlord class representatives Li Ruzhen and Yan Hengyuan so thoroughly. The author not only expresses infinite sympathy and enthusiastic support for the just actions of the peasants in the anti-traitor liquidation and land reform but also appears as an advanced element of the peasant class, representing the interests of the peasant class, and persuading those who still have confused ideas about the peasants' just actions. This is fully demonstrated in his novels "Changes in Li Village" and "The Floor."

    Comrade Zhao Shuli not only has full emotions of the oppressed class but also has an attitude of honestly serving the masses, truly "willing to be an ox for the children." Every time he participates in mass work, he truly appears as a representative of the local working people, so he is welcomed by the masses everywhere. He does this every time he collects creative materials—that is, he unifies mass work with the work of collecting materials. Precisely because of this, he can discover and solve problems and write the common problems in his work into novels to educate the broad masses of cadres and the masses.

    The reporter's conversation with Comrade Zhao Shuli began with exploring how to develop mass literature and art in the future. Comrade Zhao Shuli's opinion is: to develop mass literature and art, we should start with the transformation of drum lyrics and opera because opera is a kind of spiritual food enjoyed by more than 90% of the masses in China, and what we have done in this area is far from enough. He said: "This Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference has decided to establish a Ministry of Culture in the Central People's Government. In the future, the work of improving opera can be carried out in an all-round way. I am very satisfied and have great hopes—I hope this institution can take on the task of improving this spiritual food needed by the broad masses."

    When the topic turned to how Zhao Shuli personally strives for mass culture, it evoked painful memories for Comrade Zhao Shuli. Comrade Zhao Shuli said: "Fifteen years ago, I made a solemn vow to write something for the broad masses. At that time, although most of my friends in the literary and art circles had already inclined towards the revolution, what they wrote could not escape the circle of students and intellectuals, so there was no question of meeting the needs of the broad working masses. According to my own wishes, in 1933, when I was a teacher in Taigu, I wrote a full-length novel called "Panlongyu," which is a story about the struggle between peasants and feudal forces. Obviously, most of the newspapers at that time were controlled by feudal forces, so naturally, works that attacked them would not be published. Although I controlled a small newspaper, the space was too small, and the deposit for publishing in bookstores was too expensive, so this work had to be put on hold after writing about half of it, about 100,000 words, but I did not give up this aspiration. After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, I successively wrote some things, until after Chairman Mao delivered the new direction for literary and artistic work at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art in 1943, with the cultivation and help of the Party, my aspiration was able to develop smoothly." Speaking of this, a pleasant smile appeared on Zhao Shuli's face.

    The reporter then asked Zhao Shuli what his feelings were about attending the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference this time? Zhao Shuli said very excitedly: "The fact that the literary and art circles can send their own representatives to participate in this unprecedented founding event, organize their own government, and formulate their own common program is an unprecedented event in history. Mr. Zhou Xinfang said in his speech at the conference that in the old China, the opera circles were often under the management of the public security organs. In fact, the entire literary and art circles were not under the management of the so-called public security organs (actually secret service organs) of the reactionary government? In the past, if a young person inclined to literature and art, in the eyes of the reactionaries, it meant they inclined to revolution and were a dangerous element, and the 'public security' organs already had your name. Now, we, who have been 'managed' by the so-called 'public security organs,' can come here to organize our central government. In fact, the so-called cultural front of the reactionaries has already been completely defeated. China's literature and art and true cultural workers occupied the revolutionary position long ago. In the future, under the banner of Chairman Mao, and under the unified leadership and help of the Central People's Government, the cause of New Democratic culture will have a more rapid and vigorous atmosphere than we expected."

　　中国人民政协代表访问记
  　人民作家赵树理
    荣安
    在新中国享有盛名的小说家赵树理，是这次出席中国人民政治协商会议文艺界代表之一。
    当记者会见他时，赵树理仍然披着他从太行山上带出来的那件旧棉大衣。在他的办公桌上，除了办公用具和他的烟斗烟叶之外，还有从山西寄来的胜利剧团团员们的信。这个剧团是抗日时期赵树理亲自培养和改造出来的农村旧剧班，在那封长信里，团员们亲热地向他们的赵老师（信里是这样称呼的），报告着他们最近一个时期在农村演剧活动的情况。在谈话中，赵树理时而拿起他那心爱的三弦弹奏着小曲子，时而插入一段他对旧剧改革和创作小说的意见。勤劳、朴实、连系群众、热爱和忠于自己的事业，正是赵树理同志的宝贵品质。
    赵树理同志是从群众中来到群众中去的一位典型作家。由于他出生于农村，特别是自幼生活在一个受压迫的贫苦农民家庭，因此他就最熟习农村，尤其熟习农民受压迫和封建阶级如何剥削压迫农民的情形，又因为他亲身经受了封建地主压迫和剥削的苦痛，养成他对封建阶级的极端仇恨和对农民阶级无限热爱与同情的情感，这种情感充沛的发挥在他的创作中，因此他的作品能够在群众中引起阶级共鸣，为广大群众所欢迎，仅以他的佳作“小二黑结婚”和“李有才板话”为例，在前太行解放区说来，是推销最广的两种小册子，太行农村的所有剧团，差不多，都把这两本小册子改编成剧本搬上了舞台。
    同时，赵树理同志这种阶级感情，经过共产党多年的培育，把它引导上正确的阶级斗争道路上去，因此表现在赵树理同志的作品中，经常是以阶级斗争的姿态出现，而这种斗争又常常正确的反映了党的政策和路线，掌握了阶级斗争的艺术。
    看吧！作者对“李有才板话”里的小字辈和“李家庄变迁”里的铁锁、冷元、白狗等新农民描写的是那样的亲热，而对老奸巨滑无恶不作的地主阶级代表人物李如珍、阎恒元又是那样揭露的入骨，作者对于在反奸清算土地改革中农民的正义行动，不但寄予无限同情和热烈拥护，而且以一个农民阶级的先进分子出现，代表农民阶级的利益，说服那些对农民正义行动还有糊涂思想的人们，在他的小说“李家庄变迁”和“地板”里，就充分表现了这一点。
    赵树理同志不仅有着饱满的被压迫阶级的情感，而且有着老老实实为群众服务的态度，真是“俯首甘为孺子牛”，他每次参加群众工作，都是真正以当地劳苦群众的代表出现的，所以到处受到群众欢迎，他在每次收集创作材料时都是如此——即把作群众工作与搜集材料工作统一起来。正因为如此，所以也就能够发现问题解决问题，并把工作中普遍存在毛病，写成小说来教育广大干部和群众。
    记者和赵树理同志的谈话，是从探讨今后如何开展大众文艺这一题目开始的，赵树理同志的意见是：要开展大众文艺这一工作，应该先从改造鼓词、戏剧这方面着手，因为戏剧这一种形式在中国说来，为百分之九十以上的群众所享受的精神食粮，而我们在这一方面所作的工作还非常不够。他说：“这次人民政治协商会议决定在中央人民政府成立文化部，以后的戏曲改进工作便能全面开展，我是非常满意，而且寄予极大的希望——希望这一机构能够担负起改进这一有关广大群众所需精神食粮的任务。”
    当话题转到赵树理个人如何为大众文化而努力时，引起了赵树理同志痛切的回忆。赵树理同志说：“在十五年以前我就发下洪誓大愿，要为广大群众写点东西，那时大多数文艺界朋友虽然已倾向革命，但所写的东西还不能跳出学生和知识分子的圈子，当然就谈不到满足广大劳动群众的需要。根据我自己的志愿，一九三三年我在太谷当教员时，曾写过一部长篇小说，名子叫“盘龙峪”，是描写农民和封建势力作斗争的故事。很显然的，那时大多数报纸是操纵在封建势力手里，对于这种向他们开刀的作品当然不会被发表，自己虽然掌握着一个小报，但篇幅太小，在书店出版押金又太贵，因而这部作品只好写了一半约十万字就搁笔了，但我并没有放下这一志愿。抗日战争开始后，陆续写过一些东西，直到一九四三年延安文艺座谈会上毛主席发表了文艺工作新方针之后，在党的培养和帮助之下，我的这一志愿才得到了畅顺的发展。谈到这里，赵树理的脸上泛起了一副愉快的笑容。
    记者又询问赵树理这次出席中国人民政治协商会议有什么感想？赵树理十分兴奋的说：“文艺界能够派出自己的代表参加这一旷古未有的开国盛会，组织自己的政府，制订自己的共同纲领，这是历史上空前未有的大事。周信芳先生在大会发言上曾说，在旧中国戏剧界常是属治安机关管理。其实整个文艺界又何尝不是受反动政府的所谓治安机关（其实是特务机关）管理，以往一个青年倾向文艺，在反动派看来就是倾向革命，就是危险分子，‘治安’机关早就有了你的名字。如今我们这些曾受过所谓‘治安机关’管理的人，已经可以来这里组织我们的中央政府了。其实反动派的所谓文化阵地早已全军覆没了，中国的文艺和真正的文化工作者很早就占领了革命阵地。今后在毛主席的旗帜下，在中央人民政府统一领导和帮助之下，新民主主义的文化事业，当会更有一番我们预想得到的突飞猛进气象。”
