　　Chahar Province Unanimously Expresses
  　Support for the Three Major Documents of the CPPCC
    [Our Newspaper Zhangjiakou Dispatch, Twenty-seventh] People from all walks of life in Chahar Province and Zhangjiakou City have been studying the CPPCC documents intensely in recent days. They unanimously believe that the People's Republic of China government, the Organic Law of the People's Political Consultative Conference, and the Common Program reported on the second day of the CPPCC conference, concentrate the will of the people of the whole country and also represent the highest honor of Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people. All circles have expressed their feelings and attitudes on this matter. Sun Ming, Chairman of the Chahar Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, said: "Our working class will support it with infinite loyalty and carry the revolution through to the end. Our workers must support it by developing production." Wang Jixin, Vice President of the Zhangjiakou Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, said: "The three major documents come from the people and return to the people." Wang Ping, Commander of the Chahar Military Region, said: Zhu Commander-in-Chief's speech on September 24th, "Guaranteeing the Implementation of the Common Program," completely represents our wishes. This is a true reflection of the sentiments, demands, and hopes of all our commanders and fighters. Li Shunqin, Director of the Education Department of the Chahar Provincial People's Government, stated: The educational circles of Chahar Province are determined to wholeheartedly support the Common Program of the People's Political Consultative Conference and strive for its concrete realization! Representatives from the industrial and commercial circles in Zhangjiakou City unanimously believe that incorporating Chairman Mao's "both labor and capital benefit, giving consideration to both public and private interests, mutual assistance between urban and rural areas, and internal and external exchanges" policy into the Common Program is good news for industry and commerce across the country. Responsible persons from the Chahar Provincial Women's Federation, the Youth League, and the Zhangjiakou Student Federation also unanimously believe that the three major documents truly meet the requirements of the people. Gan Lin, Director of the Zhangjiakou Muslim Association, Jin Dianjie, Imam of the Mosque, Muslim representatives Yu Dehai and Sha Youliang, and Mongolians Gongbu Zha Pu, Guo Chimin, and Meng Ke, all praised Chairman Mao's wise leadership in liberating the Hui and Mongolian nationalities, making the People's Republic of China a big family of brotherly and cooperative ethnic groups.
