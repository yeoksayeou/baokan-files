　　The Afforestation Movement in North China
    Zheng Jia
    Before discussing the movement itself, let me first tell you about a small village with over 150 households in Laishui County, west of Beiping, called Shalingxi. More than a hundred years ago, this place was still a vast, uninhabited mountain forest. Later, the wealthy and powerful came and designated the mountains as their property. Farmers who came to cut trees for charcoal or clear land for farming had to pay rent and an axe tax. It wasn't until the Communist Party came and implemented rent reduction and interest rate reduction, and then land reform, that the lives of the farmers in Shalingxi gradually improved.

    The farmers cherish the trees on the mountains very much. They often say, "As long as the green hills remain, there's no need to worry about firewood." They also say, "If I have a thousand trees and ten acres of cornfields, the trees can build houses, and the corn can make porridge, so the whole family can enjoy happiness together." The farmers of Shalingxi, by preserving and nurturing the mountain forests for long-term benefit, have preserved and grown clusters of arbors and shrubs on the mountains. At a glance, it's all green hills and grass, and in spring, it's even more of a riot of peach and plum blossoms. They rely on this mountain for timber, selling wood, making farm tools, burning charcoal, and extracting walnut and almond oil; every household also relies on this mountain for raising cattle and sheep, and grazing donkeys and horses. Moreover, because the mountain forests are dense, heavy rains don't wash away the fields, and strong winds don't cause sandstorms. The thick layer of black soil (scientifically known as humus) preserved on the mountain often enriches the land during rainfall, gradually making the soil fertile. Mountain forests, animal husbandry, and agricultural products combined, in normal years, the entire village can earn 2,500 shi of corn, averaging more than three shi and three dou per person, greatly improving their lives.

    From the example of Shalingxi village, how beneficial are forests to farmers? Therefore, farmers understand the importance of protecting, using, and developing them.

    Another reason why the mountain forests of Shalingxi village have been preserved and grown is naturally that this village is located in the most consolidated part of the old liberated areas; for several years, it has not been destroyed by the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang bandit troops. In many areas of North China, especially in places where the struggle against the enemy was fierce in the past, the situation is different: as a result of the Japanese devils and Kuomintang bandit troops felling trees and destroying them wantonly, many green hills have turned into barren hills, and fertile fields have turned into wasteland; this, in turn, has caused years of floods, droughts, and wind disasters. Although the democratic government has been calling on and educating the masses to plant trees and create forests on a large scale every year, only partial results have been achieved due to the impact of the war. As North China gradually moves towards full liberation, and the farmers' land demands are gradually resolved, their enthusiasm for production has greatly increased, and the work of planting trees and creating forests has also moved forward. The afforestation work during the spring and summer rainy seasons this year has achieved unprecedented results. According to statistics from the Agricultural Department of the North China Government, the number of trees planted in the spring alone exceeded the original annual plan by 27.5 percent; especially in Chahar Province, it exceeded the original annual plan by more than three times.

    How did such great achievements come about? How were these trees planted?

    Since 1942, when Chairman Mao called for "getting organized," mutual assistance and cooperation in agricultural production has become a widespread movement. In many places where afforestation has been successful, the cooperative mutual assistance method has been adopted. Let me give you an example:

    North of Yanmen Pass, the Daying Village area in Fanshi County is the source of the Hutuo River. The terrain is high, and the wind is strong. Since ancient times, there has been a saying, "Of the thirteen provinces in the world, Daying is the main wind tunnel." Daying is the main wind tunnel, which means that the strong winds in the world all blow from Daying; one can imagine how strong the wind is here. When the Japanese invaders occupied this place, they washed and cut down the trees year after year, making the wind and sand even fiercer. To resist this fierce wind and sand, planting a few small trees by one person or one family would not do much. So, what to do? In 1947, the democratic government helped Daying Village and three nearby villages to jointly organize a windbreak forest cooperative. Following this, two nearby villages jointly organized another cooperative, and other villages also organized cooperatives. In this way, there were a total of five cooperatives. They gathered experienced old farmers to discuss tree planting methods and decided to first build a mother tree forest of 100,000 trees. For those who lacked tree saplings, the democratic government invested as shares. The tree saplings obtained from the government's share of the dividends each year would then be used to expand afforestation to the surrounding villages. When the farmers saw that such large-scale afforestation would definitely succeed, and that the completed forest would definitely withstand the gale, and that the method of sharing dividends for investment was fair and reasonable, everyone's confidence increased. Although that year unfortunately coincided with a major drought, the farmers watered and nurtured the trees, and selected special personnel to take care of them. The students of Daying Village Elementary School also took turns patrolling the forest after school, which played a major role. As a result, the survival rate of the planted trees was 50% in some places, and as high as 85% in others. Last year, five new afforestation cooperatives were established near Daying Village, and afforestation was carried out in both spring and autumn. The share calculation method of these five newly established cooperatives is even simpler and more rational. Each village has one cooperative, using public land to cultivate tree saplings. The tree saplings cultivated are considered village public shares. Labor shares are calculated based on the work done or the number of trees planted, all on a per-household basis. Because cooperative afforestation in Daying and its surrounding areas is so lively, it has promoted the afforestation movement throughout Fanshi County. Last year, Fanshi County planted a total of more than 90,000 poplar and willow trees and sowed more than 13,000 fruit trees such as walnuts, peaches, and apricots. This afforestation movement is still continuing vigorously, preparing to create a county-wide windbreak forest belt.

    Another example is the Tang River bank alluvium afforestation cooperative in Hebei Province. Its nature is the same as that of the Daying afforestation cooperative in Fanshi, which is also a joint cooperative among various villages, with the purpose of creating a large-scale flood and sand prevention forest belt. Now, the banks of the Tang River are lush with trees, planted with more than 200,000 poplars, willows, jujube trees, and reeds.

    According to Soviet scientists, in the Soviet Union, forests must account for more than 30% of the total area to avoid natural disasters such as floods, droughts, wind, and hail. The most basic way for the Soviet Union to conquer these natural disasters is to establish forest protection belts. According to statistics in the first year of the Republic of China, China's forests accounted for only 5%; after more than 30 years of serious damage caused by warlord melee, Kuomintang reactionary rule, and imperialist aggression, the forest area has been greatly reduced. The North China People's Government attaches great importance to afforestation work. It has now formulated a forestation plan for next year, preparing to mobilize farmers to plant nearly 50 million trees, and sow seeds on 105,000 mu of barren hills. This autumn, it will collect a large number of seeds and establish nurseries. The North China People's Government is also preparing to formulate a forest law to determine forest rights and a forest protection law. Now, the North China People's Government's forestry inspection group to Chabei and Suidong has set off. Chahar Province has formulated a 20-year afforestation plan for Chabei, preparing to create a basic windbreak forest belt within 20 years, so that it can be expanded into a northwest windbreak forest belt bordering the five provinces of Rehe, Chahar, Suiyuan, Gansu, Ningxia, and Mongolia in the future. After the northwest windbreak forest belt is created, the great wind and sand of the Mongolian grasslands will not endanger the vast agricultural areas of North China, and the common droughts and floods in North China and Northwest China can be greatly reduced. The vast North China and Northwest China will be transformed into a good place with favorable weather and moderate temperatures. We believe that this large-scale afforestation movement will definitely achieve brilliant results under the enthusiastic support and collective efforts of the liberated farmers.

　　华北的植树造林运动
    郑佳
    在还没有说到这个运动本身以前，先说在北平西面的涞水县，有一个一百五十多户人家的小村，名字叫砂岭西。一百多年以前，这个地方还是没有人烟的大山林。后来有钱有势的人来了，便指山为界，霸占山林作为自己的产业。农民来砍树烧炭、开荒种地，都得交租钱，拿斧子钱。一直到共产党来了，实行了减租减息，又实行了土地改革以后，砂岭西农民的生活，才渐渐有了起色。
    农民对山上的林木非常爱惜，他们常常叨念：“留得青山在，不怕没柴烧。”又说：“我有树千棵，棒子地十亩，树可以造屋，棒子可以熬粥，一家老少同享福。”砂岭西的农民，用养山护林，长期取利的办法，让山上保存和滋长了一丛丛的乔木林和灌木林。展眼一看，一片的青山绿草，春天更是闹嚷嚷的桃李争艳。他们使木材、卖木料、做农具、烧木炭、熬核桃油、杏仁油，都是靠的这座山；家家户户养牛养羊，放驴放马，也是靠的这座山。更因为山林茂密，下大雨的时候，不致于冲毁田园，刮大风的时候，不致于风砂漫地，山上保存的一层很厚的黑土（科学上的名词叫做腐植质）在下雨的时候，常常淤在地里，土地就慢慢的肥起来了。山林、畜牧、农产，三样加在一块，在平常的年头，全村可以收入两千五百石玉米，平均每人收到三石三斗多，生活大大的上升了。
    从砂岭西村的例子看，林木对农民该有多大的好处？所以农民是非常懂得爱护、使用和发展它的。
    砂岭西村的山林，能够得到保存、滋长的另一个原因，自然是这个村子是处在老解放区最巩固的地方；几年以来，这里没有遭到过日寇和国民党匪军的破坏。在华北的许多地区，特别是过去对敌斗争残酷的地方，情形就两样了：日本鬼子和国民党匪军伐山砍树、大肆破坏的结果，很多的青山变成了秃山，肥田变成了荒地；从这又引起了连年的水灾、旱灾和风灾。虽然民主政府年年都在号召群众和教育群众大量地植树造林，可是因为受到战争的影响，只收到部分的成绩。到华北一步一步的走向全境解放，农民的土地要求也一步一步的得到解决，生产情绪大大提高起来，植树造林的工作，也随着向前开展，今年春季和夏天雨季的造林工作，得到了空前的成绩。据华北政府农业部统计，单是春季造林的数字，就超过全年原订计划的百分之二十七点五；尤其是察哈尔省，更超过全年原订计划的三倍多。
    怎样会得到这么大的成绩的呢？这些树是怎样种起来的呢？
    自从一九四二年，毛主席号召“组织起来”以后，在农业生产上实行互助合作，已经成为普遍的运动。植树造林成绩好的地方，很多是由于采取了合作互助的办法。举例子说吧：
    雁门关北面，繁峙县大营村一带，是滹沱河的发源地，地势高，风势猛，古来就有“天下十三省，大营总风筒”的说法。大营总风筒，这意思就是说天下的大风都是从大营吹来的；可以想见这里的风势有多厉害。日寇占据这里的时候，连年洗伐树林，使得风沙刮得更猛了。要想抵抗这种猛烈的风沙，一个人，一家造几棵小树是顶不了什么事的。那么怎么办呢？一九四七年，民主政府帮助大营村和附近三个村，一同组织了一个防风林合作社，紧跟着附近又有两个村联合组织了一个合作社，另外还有其他村也组织合作社。这样一来，一共就有五个合作社了。他们把有经验的老农民召集起来，讨论了栽树的方法，决定先造母树林十万棵，缺树秧的，民主政府投资算股，每年政府这一股分得的红利树秧，再向四外各村扩大造林。农民一看，这样大规模的造林一定能造成，林造成了一定能顶住狂风，再加上入股分红的办法又公平合理，大家的信心增加了。那年虽然不巧赶上个大旱灾，可是农民浇水养树，又选出专人照看，大营村高小的学生下了课轮流巡护树林也顶了大事，结果，种活的树，有的地方是五成，有的多到八成半。到了去年，大营村附近又新扩大了五个造林合作社，春秋两季都开展了造林。这五个新成立的合作社算股的办法，更加简单化合理化，都是一村一社，利用公地培养树秧，培养出树秧来算做村公股，劳力股有的照出的工算，有的照栽的树算，都是以户为单位入股。因为大营这一带合作造林闹得这样热闹，推动了全繁峙县的造林运动，去年繁峙全县一共栽了杨柳九万多棵，播种核桃、桃子、杏子这一类的果树一万三千多棵。这个造林运动，还在蓬勃的继续进行，准备造成全县的防风林带。
    再如河北省唐河两岸的成滩造林合作社，和繁峙大营的造林合作社性质一样，也是联合各村，分段合作的，目的是造成大规模的防洪防沙林带。现在唐河两岸已经绿树成荫，栽满了二十多万棵的杨柳、枣树和芦苇了。
    据苏联科学家的研究，在苏联，按整个面积计算，必须有百分之三十以上的森林，才可以免掉水、旱、风、雹的天灾。苏联征服这些天然灾害的最基本的办法，是建立森林防护带。中国的森林，据民国元年的统计，才只有百分之五；经过这三十多年的军阀混战、国民党反动派统治和帝国主义侵略的严重破坏，森林的面积更是大大减少了。华北人民政府非常重视造林工作，现在已经订出了明年的造林计划，准备在一年里面发动农民造林将近五千万棵，荒山播种造林十万五千多亩，今年秋天要大量的采集种子，建立苗圃。华北人民政府并且准备制订森林法确定林权和森林保护法。现在，华北人民政府农业部到察北绥东的林业考察团已经出发了。察哈尔省已经拟定了一个察北廿年造林计划，准备在二十年里面，造成基干的防风林带，以便将来扩大成为热河、察哈尔、绥远、甘肃、宁夏五省和蒙古交界地区的西北防风林带。西北防风林带造成以后，蒙古草原的大风沙就不致于危害华北广大的农业区，华北和西北常见的旱灾和水灾可以大大减少，广大的华北和西北，将一变而成为风调雨顺寒暑适宜的好地方，我们相信，这个大规模的造林运动，在解放了的广大农民热诚拥护和集体努力之下，一定可以获得辉煌的成绩。
