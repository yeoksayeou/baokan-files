A Visit with a Delegate to the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference - Liu Shanben, Representative of the People's Air Force
Bai Zi

Three years ago, when the Kuomintang reactionaries launched an all-out civil war, they, supported by American imperialists, thought they could bully the Chinese people at will, and unscrupulously tore up the resolutions of the Old Political Consultative Conference. At that time, many people could not see the strength of the Chinese people clearly and worried whether she could withstand the offensive of the reactionaries. It was at this moment, on June 26, 1946, that Liu Shanben, through his active action against the civil war, resolutely broke away from the reactionary camp of the US-Chiang clique, becoming the first to fly a B-24 type No. 530 aircraft to Yan'an, the sacred place of light and freedom.

Time flies, it has been three years. Today, in the days of the people's victory, when the People's Political Consultative Conference is convened in the people's capital, the reporter met Liu Shanben, who flew to Yan'an in an uprising back then and is now a soldier of the People's Air Force. He is thirty-four years old this year, and his hometown is Anqiu County, Shandong. He looks tall and speaks very frankly, still retaining the simple characteristics of Shandong people. When he flew to Yan'an in an uprising, he was a captain pilot in the 35th Squadron of the 8th Group of the Kuomintang Central Aviation. Fourteen years ago, he was still a student at the Pingda Affiliated High School in Beiping. At that time, hating the Japanese invasion of China, he was admitted to the Hangzhou Jianqiao Aviation School in 1935. During the War of Resistance, he served in Kunming, Chengdu, Lanzhou and other places, and in 1943 he was sent by the Kuomintang to the Douglas and Arezana Advanced Aviation School in the United States and Albuquerque, New Mexico, for B-24 basic flight training.

When the reporter talked to him about the situation of the uprising at that time, it seemed as if everything was still vivid in his mind. He pondered for a moment and laughed heartily and innocently. He said, "This is a day I will never forget in my life. This uprising determined my future path." Why was he able to be so brave and dare to fly in an uprising when Chiang Kai-shek, a running dog of American imperialism, still seemed so rampant? He told the reporter that he was responding to Chairman Mao's call against the civil war. At that time, he saw Chairman Mao's statement on June 22 in Chengdu opposing the US military aid to Chiang Kai-shek bill. He applied for the Air Force originally to "serve the country through military service," but after he returned from the United States after learning to fly, Japanese imperialism had already surrendered, but he was driven by the Kuomintang reactionaries to fly American planes again to either bomb Chinese land or transport troops and guns and ammunition manufactured by American imperialism to slaughter the Chinese people. He hated the dark, corrupt, and degenerate Kuomintang reactionary government, and he hated even more the Kuomintang reactionaries selling China's territorial airspace and waters cleanly to American imperialism. This made him resolutely break away from the reactionary camp of the US-Chiang clique and fly to the liberated areas of light and freedom.

He talked about the day he flew in the uprising - June 26, 1946. That was a tense and exciting day. He said, "I still remember clearly that it was a rainy day. I took off from Xinjin Airport in Chengdu in gloomy and dangerous weather. Originally, the mission of this plane was to fly to Kunming to transfer military communications equipment, but under my pre-arranged arrangements, as soon as I took off, half an hour later, I turned the direction to the northwest and flew straight to the high altitude in the northwest. But the weather got worse and worse, and we could only fly blindly in dense clouds and heavy rain. We didn't come out of the clouds and see the ground until we were not far from Yan'an. Yan'an was an extremely familiar name to me, but the place was unfamiliar. I turned around near Yan'an but couldn't find Yan'an. I always thought that this world-famous city was a densely populated big city. When I saw the airport, I was really so happy that I wanted to shout, but I was immediately afraid - afraid that the anti-aircraft guns below would shoot me down, so I quickly landed sharply. When the plane stopped next to the airport runway, I jumped out of the plane and shouted, 'We are here to oppose the civil war!'" At that time, the airport was heavily guarded, and many guards initially looked at us with hatred, but later, when they knew why we had flown here, they all happily welcomed us."

He said happily, "I lived in Yan'an for a period of time, and everything made me feel so fresh and energetic. I began to live happily in the revolutionary melting pot." Then he said angrily, "But soon, on August 2, the Kuomintang reactionaries came to bomb and strafe Yan'an. What else can be said? Who is launching the civil war after all? All this has further strengthened my understanding. I clearly recognized the hideous face of the reactionaries. From this time on, I became even more determined. I am determined to be a soldier of the People's Air Force and contribute my strength to the people."

Three years have passed, and Liu Shanben is working and studying happily for the construction of the People's Air Force. In the opening speech of this People's Political Consultative Conference, Chairman Mao called for building a strong air force. When the reporter talked to Liu Shanben about this issue, he firmly stated to the reporter that he would definitely respond to Chairman Mao's call and strive to complete the glorious task given by the people. He said with a smile: "Today, even in the Kuomintang reactionary air force, there must be many young people with a sense of justice who will respond to Chairman Mao's call and come to the People's Air Force. In the past, there have been many uprisings from the air and from the ground, and there will inevitably be more in the near future." Finally, he firmly said: "I believe that under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and with the support of the working people, the People's Air Force will surely grow rapidly and, together with the People's Army and Navy, form a strong fortress to defend the motherland and defend world peace."

　　中国人民政协代表访问记　人民空军代表　刘善本
    柏子
    三年以前，在国民党反动派发动全面内战的时候，那时国民党反动派在美帝国主义者的支援下，以为中国人民可以任意欺侮，毫无顾忌地撕毁了旧政协的决议；当时很多人还看不清中国人民的力量，耽心着她是否抵挡得住反动派的进攻。就在这个时候，在一九四六年的六月二十六日，刘善本便以反对内战的积极行动，毅然脱离美蒋反动阵营，第一个驾驶Ｂ二十四型五三○号飞机，飞向了光明自由的圣地延安。
    日子过得真快，三年了，今天在人民胜利的日子，人民的首都，人民政协召开的时候，记者会见了这位当年驾机起义飞延现在已成为人民空军战士的刘善本。他今年三十四岁，老家是山东的安邱县，看起来他个儿高高，说话非常爽直，还保持着他那种山东人的淳朴特色。他驾驶飞机起义飞延的时候，是国民党中央航空第八大队三十五中队的上尉飞行员。十四年前，他还是北平平大附中的学生，当时因痛恨日本人的侵略中国，就在一九三五年考入杭州笕桥航空学校。抗战中间，他曾先后在昆明、成都、兰州等地服务，并在一九四三年被国民党派至美国道格拉斯、阿雷藏那高级航空学校及新墨西哥州阿尔博克尔克作Ｂ二十四型基本飞行训练。
    当记者和他谈起当时起义的情形时，他好象一切都历历在目前。他沉思了一下，爽朗天真地笑了起来，他说：“这是我一生永远也忘不掉的一天，这次的起义，决定了我今后的道路。”他为什么能够那样勇敢地，在美帝国主义的走狗蒋介石看来还是那么嚣张的时候，就敢于驾机起义呢？他告诉记者，当时他是响应毛主席反内战的号召。那时他在成都看到了毛主席在六月二十二日发表的关于反对美国军事援蒋法案的声明。他投考空军，原是为了“从军报国”，但是他从美国学驾驶回来后，日本帝国主义已经投降，而他却被国民党反动派驱使着再驾驶美国飞机或者轰炸中国的土地，或者运送军队和美帝制造的枪炮子弹屠杀中国的人民；他痛恨蒋介石反动政府黑暗贪污、腐化，更痛恨国民党反动派把中国的领空、领海干干净净地卖给美帝国主义，这就使他毅然脱离美蒋反动阵营，飞向光明自由的解放区。
    他谈起了他驾机起义的那一天——一九四六年六月二十六日。那是多紧张多兴奋的一天。他说：“我还清楚地记得那是一个下雨天，我冒着阴晦危险的天气，从成都新津机场起飞，本来这架飞机的任务，是飞赴昆明转运军用通讯器材的，但在我事先布置好的情况下，一升空，半小时后，我便把方向转向西北，直向西北高空中飞行，但天气愈来愈坏，我们都只能在浓云大雨中作盲目飞行。离延安不远时才钻到云下来看到地面。延安这一个对我极熟悉的名字，然而地方都是陌生的。在延安的附近转却找不到延安，我总以为这闻名世界的名城，是一个人烟稠密的大城市。及至看见了飞机场，我真的高兴得想叫了起来，但是立即又怕——怕下面的高射炮给打下来，于是赶快急遽降落。当飞机在机场跑道旁边停下后，我即跃出机门，高喊：“我们是反内战来的！”当时机场戒备很严，当初许多警卫员都很愤恨的望着我们，可是后来当他们知道我们是为什么飞来的以后，便都高兴的欢迎着我们。”
    他愉快的叙说着：“在延安我住了一个时期，一切都使我觉得那么新鲜、有生气，我开始愉快的生活在革命的大熔炉里。”接着他愤恨的说：“但是不久，在八月二号的这一天国民党反动派竟来轰炸扫射延安，还说什么呢？这到底是谁在发动内战，这一切都更深深地加强了我的认识。我清楚的认识了反动派狰狞的面目，从这时起我更坚定起我自己，我决心做一个人民空军的战士，为人民而贡献我的力量。”
    三年的时光已经过去，刘善本在为人民的空军建设事业而愉快的工作着、学习着。在这次人民政协开幕词里，毛主席号召建设一支强大的空军。当记者和刘善本谈到这个问题时，他向记者坚决的表示：一定响应毛主席的号召，为完成人民所给予的光荣任务而奋斗。他笑着说：“今天，即或在国民党反动派空军里也一定会有不少富于正义感的青年来响应毛主席这个号召，走到人民空军里来。过去已经有过不少从空中从地面起义过来的，不久的将来必然更多”。最后他坚决的说：“相信在中国共产党和毛主席、朱总司令的英明领导下，在劳动人民的支持下，人民的空军必然会很快的壮大起来，随同人民的陆军、海军，组成保卫祖国，保卫世界和平的坚强堡垒”。
