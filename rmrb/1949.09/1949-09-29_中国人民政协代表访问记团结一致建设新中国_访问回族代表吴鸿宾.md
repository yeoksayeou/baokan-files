A Record of Visits with Representatives to the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference: Unite and Build a New China
　　Visiting Hui Representative Wu Hongbin
　　Lin Mo
　　Hui representative Wu Hongbin is the head of the Lanzhou branch of the China Democratic League and was appointed Deputy Director of the Lanzhou Military Control Commission and Mayor of Lanzhou after the liberation of Lanzhou. He is from Tianshui County, Gansu Province. After graduating from Peking University in 1930, he struggled for the cause of national liberation for many years. During the January 28th Incident, he engaged in anti-Japanese work in Shanghai. During the Xi'an Incident, he organized the Hui Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association in Xi'an. Later, he engaged in democratic work in Lanzhou, Pingliang, and other places. In 1945, he began to organize the Lanzhou branch of the China Democratic League.
　　Regarding the creation of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and this great turning point in Chinese history, Representative Wu Hongbin said, "Under the victorious banner of Mao Zedong, the Chinese people have their own new motherland from today onwards. We are overjoyed and celebrating endlessly. From now on, our Hui people will unite firmly and amicably with all ethnic groups to build a happy new China." Representative Wu Hongbin cited the provisions of the Common Program of the People's Political Consultative Conference regarding ethnic policies, which aim to realize friendly cooperation among all ethnic groups in China, implement regional ethnic autonomy, unify all ethnic groups to participate in the People's Liberation Army, develop the languages, writing, politics, economy, and culture of all ethnic groups, respect the customs and habits of all ethnic groups, and implement religious freedom. These are the demands for which the Hui people have shed blood and struggled countless times over the years, and they have finally been realized today.
　　Representative Wu Hongbin then recounted to the reporter the cruel exploitation, killing, and oppression suffered by the Hui people in the Northwest under the feudal rule of the Ma family warlords, as well as the people's uprisings and struggles. For decades, the Ma family bandits were hereditary rulers in the Northwest. Important officials were all their relatives and nobles. Landlords and usurers were bound to them by blood. There were no fixed standards for collecting grain and forage from the people. Many only sons could not escape being conscripted. The rulers' lives of extravagance and debauchery reached the extreme. Ma Hongkui alone had dozens of maids and concubines, and his mansion became a famous opera troupe. Ma Bufang learned from the bandit Chiang Kai-shek and established a vicious secret service rule, with the people's lives and deaths entirely dependent on his own whims. In recent years, the Hui people, under the pressure of cruel taxation and killings, rose up to resist desperately. For example, during the Haiyuan-Guyuan people's uprising in Gansu in 1939 and 1940, the Chiang and Ma bandit troops besieged and suppressed the uprising with more than three divisions of troops. Over the course of two years, nearly ten thousand Hui people were brutally killed, and property such as cattle, sheep, and horses was looted. At that time, many Hui people abandoned their homes and fled to the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region under the leadership of the Communist Party, seeking a peaceful life. In 1942, in Dingxi and Yuzhong areas in southern Gansu, the Hui and Han people united to resist oppression and atrocities. The Chiang and Ma bandits mobilized nearly 100,000 troops to carry out a massacre. The Hui people in the Northwest have deep and painful memories of this. Therefore, when the People's Liberation Army advanced into the Northwest, every Hui person, regardless of their sect or gender, hated and detested the reactionary rulers. The People's Liberation Army deeply cherished the Hui people after entering the Northwest, protected Hui cultural monuments, respected Hui customs and habits, did not enter mosques, and did not take a needle or thread from the people. These excellent discipline and exemplary actions made the Hui people realize that the People's Liberation Army was truly their own army.

　　中国人民政协代表访问记团结一致建设新中国
  　访问回族代表吴鸿宾
    林沫
    回族代表吴鸿宾是民盟兰州支部负责人，兰州解放后被任为兰州军管会副主任兼兰州市市长。他是甘肃天水县人，一九三○年在北大毕业后，多年来为民族解放事业而斗争。一二八事变时在上海进行抗日工作，双十二事变时曾在西安组织回民抗日救国会，后一直在兰州、平凉等地进行民主工作，民国三十四年开始在兰州组织民盟支部。
    对人民政协的开创，对中国人民有史以来这个伟大的翻身时日，吴鸿宾代表说：“中国人民在胜利的毛泽东旗帜下，从今天起有了自己新的祖国。我们欢喜不尽，庆祝不尽，我们回族人民今后将坚强、友爱的和各族人民团结一致，来建设一个幸福的新中国。”吴鸿宾代表举出人民政协的共同纲领中对于民族政策的规定，要实现中国各民族的友爱合作，实行区域性的民族自治，各民族统一参加人民解放军，发展各民族的语言文字、政治、经济、文化的建设，尊重各民族的风俗习惯，实行宗教自由。这些都是回族人民多年来无数次流血斗争的要求，今天终于实现了。
    吴鸿宾代表继而向记者讲述西北回族人民多年来遭受马家匪帮封建统治者残酷的压榨杀害及人民起来反抗斗争的情形。马家匪徒数十年来在西北是世袭的统治者，重要官员都是他们的皇亲贵族，大地主、高利贷者和他们结着血缘，向人民征粮要草从无标准定数，捕抓壮丁，很多独子亦难逃免，统治者的生活骄奢淫侈达于极点，马鸿逵一人就有几十个丫头妻妾，他的公馆成为有名的二簧班子。马步芳学习蒋匪介石建立了一套凶恶的特务统治，人民的生杀完全决定于他自己的喜怒。连年来回族人民在酷征虐杀的逼迫下起而拼死反抗，如民国二十八、二十九两年中甘肃发生海（原）固（原）民变，蒋、马匪军以三师以上兵力围攻镇下，前后经两年，回民惨遭杀害者近万，牛羊马匹等财产掠夺一空，当时曾有很多回民弃家逃向共产党领导下的陕甘宁边区，谋得安乐生活。民国三十一年在甘肃南部定西、榆中一带，回、汉人民曾一致团结起来反抗压迫暴行，蒋、马匪曾动员近十万兵力进行屠杀。对此西北回族人民深留着各种痛苦的记忆，故当人民解放军进抵西北后，回民中无论那一教派及任何一个男女，对反动统治者无不仇恨痛恶；而人民解放军进抵西北后深切爱护回族人民，保护回民文化古迹，尊重回民风俗习惯，不进礼拜寺，不拿用人民一针一线等优良纪律与模范行动，使回族人民认识到了人民解放军才真是回族人民自己的军队。
