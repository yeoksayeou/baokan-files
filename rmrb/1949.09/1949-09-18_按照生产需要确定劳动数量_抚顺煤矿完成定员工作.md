Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 16th. The Fushun Coal Mine's open-pit department successfully completed the "staffing" work (i.e., determining the amount of labor based on production needs) by adopting a democratic evaluation method combining top-down and bottom-up approaches. The coal mining and stripping operations streamlined a total of 412 people and adjusted and transferred 592 people to more appropriate jobs. After staffing, not only was the waste of labor reduced, but the workers' enthusiasm was also significantly improved, and production efficiency generally increased. For example, after the East Coal Mine reduced more than 380 redundant personnel, its production volume in ten days exceeded 30% of the pre-staffing level. The staffing work began on August 14th and was completed in early September, divided into four stages: The first stage was to carry out ideological mobilization among cadres and workers and complete various preparations. During the mobilization, it was emphasized that staffing was important for economic accounting and improving production, and the serious waste of manpower was explained by comparing the output and manpower of the puppet Manchukuo era with the present. Concerns of workers about layoffs, fear of overwork due to reduced manpower, and fear of being transferred to coal mining were addressed through persuasion and explanation, clarifying that the purpose of staffing was to appropriately allocate labor, so that everyone had work to do and everyone was fully utilized. Technical personnel were allocated to technical work as much as possible. At the same time, staffing committees at all levels, including factory directors, engineers, trade union cadres, and worker representatives, were established to formulate registration forms for surplus personnel, staffing tables, and prepare for the handling and welcoming of surplus personnel. The second stage was to determine the labor quota by adopting the method of initial determination from top to bottom, re-determination from bottom to top, and finally decision through centralized discussion. First, engineers and technicians, based on the production plan, efficiency records, machinery and equipment, work scope, and the existing labor force allocation, drafted a preliminary staffing plan and submitted it to the workers for discussion, where they revised and supplemented the draft based on the actual situation. After the revision, it was discussed centrally, and the final decision was made by the General Staffing Committee. Because ideological education was conducted and democracy was promoted, employees actively and responsibly participated in the staffing work. For example, the transportation department of the Selection and Transportation Division automatically reduced 11 more workers during the discussion, and the truck loading department of the West Coal Mine also automatically reduced 14 workers; some units also reasonably increased workers based on the actual situation. This stage was also combined with the method of explaining reasons and calculating detailed accounts to further educate employees to supplement the shortcomings of the ideological mobilization stage. The third stage was to evaluate the surplus list based on the principle of "self-reporting and public discussion, subject to approval by higher authorities." The method was to first mobilize workers to evaluate themselves based on the reduction standards, then have everyone evaluate at mass meetings to initially determine the surplus list, and finally submit it to the section chief for review and stamping before submitting it to the staffing committees at all levels for decision. The evaluation criteria were mainly based on the size of the contribution to production (technical level and physical strength), while labor attitude and attendance were considered as additional conditions. Such standards are both reasonable and easy to grasp, so there were few or no deviations. The fourth stage was to arrange the resettlement of surplus personnel and organize welcoming and send-off activities. Each unit organized a Yangko team to send off surplus personnel to new jobs or welcome workers transferred from other units to participate in the work, and everyone was in high spirits. The shortcoming of this staffing work was that some units still bargained in the process of determining the quota, using the excuse of "fear of not completing the task." During the democratic evaluation of the list, some units also had errors such as voting and drawing lots. In the resettlement of surplus personnel, there were also cases where explanations were not timely and arrangements were improper, resulting in dissatisfaction among some personnel. The leaders of the factories and mines failed to go deep into the workshops and groups, grasp the specific situation, conduct publicity and explanations, and correct errors and deviations in a timely manner. The discovery of these shortcomings can enable other units to pay attention to prevention in advance when carrying out "staffing" work.

### 按照生产需要确定劳动数量　抚顺煤矿完成定员工作

　　按照生产需要确定劳动数量
  　抚顺煤矿完成定员工作
    【新华社沈阳十六日电】抚顺煤矿露天处采用上下结合的民主评议方式，胜利完成了“定员”（即依据生产需要确定劳动力的数量）工作。该处采煤，剥离两矿共精简了四百十二人，并有五百九十二人调整和转换到更适当的工作岗位。定员以后，不仅劳动力的浪费减少，工人积极性也显著提高，生产效率普遍增加。如东采煤厂减去了三百八十名多余的人力后，十天中生产量已超出定员前的百分之三十。此次定员工作自八月十四日开始，至九月上旬完成，共分为四个阶段：第一阶段是在干部和工人中进行思想动员，并完成各项准备工作。在动员中，强调说明定员对经济核算、提高生产的重要性，并以伪满时代与现在的产量和人力对比，说明现在人力浪费的严重。对工人群众怕裁员、怕人少受累及怕调去挖煤等顾虑，则进行说服解释，讲清定员的目的是适当配备劳动力，使人人都有工做，一人顶一人用。对技术人员则尽量分配做技术工作。同时，即建立包括厂长、工程师、工会干部及工人代表参加的各级定员编制委员会，制订编余人员登记表、定员表，并进行其他有关编余人员的处理及欢迎欢送的准备工作。第二阶级是采用由上而下的初定，由下而上的复定，最后再经过集中讨论决定的办法，确定劳动定额。首先由工程师、技师根据生产计划，效率纪录、机器设备、工作范围及现有劳动力配备情况，拟定初步定员草案，交职工群众讨论，由他们结合实际情况，对草案加以修改补充。修改后再集中讨论，由总编制委员会最后决定。由于进行了思想教育和发扬民主，因而职工都积极负责地参加定员工作。如选运股运输系在讨论中自动多减了十一名工人，西采煤厂装大车系亦自动减出十四名；也有一些单位则根据实际情况，合理地增加了工人。这一阶段中并结合讲道理算细帐的办法，进一步对职工进行了酝酿教育，以辅助思想动员阶段的不足。第三阶段是根据“自报公议，上级批准”的原则评议编余名单。办法是根据减员标准，先发动工人自己评自己，再在群众会议上大家评，初步确定编余名单，最后交系长审查盖章交各级编制委员会决定。评定的标准主要是根据对生产贡献大小（技术高低及体力强弱）来决定，至于劳动态度，上工多少则为附带条件。这样的标准既合理亦易于掌握，因而不出或少出偏差。第四阶段是进行编余人员的安置及组织欢迎欢送工作。各单位组织了秧歌队欢送编余人员到新的工作岗位，或欢迎别的单位调来的工人参加工作，大家情绪都很高。此次定员工作中的缺点是在确定定额过程中，仍有个别单位借口“怕完不成任务”因而讨价还价的。在民主评议名单时，也有个别单位发生票选、抓阄等错误现象。在安置编余人员中，亦曾有未及时解释及安置欠妥，因而造成个别人员不满的。在厂矿领导者方面则是未能深入车间、小组、具体掌握情况，进行宣传解释，及时纠正错误与偏差。这些缺点的发现，可使其他单位在进行“定员”工作时，预先注意防止。
