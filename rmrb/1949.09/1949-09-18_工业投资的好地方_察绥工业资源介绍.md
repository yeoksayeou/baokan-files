　　Good Place for Industrial Investment
  　Introduction to Industrial Resources of Chahar and Suiyuan
    By our reporter Feng Zhong
    During the recent industrial tour group from Beiping to Chahar and Suiyuan, based on the principle of "relying on raw materials," it was learned that Chahar and Suiyuan have many resources worth utilizing and even necessary to utilize for industrial development. In addition, the local coal in Xiahuayuan and Kouquan, the electricity in Xiahuayuan, and inexpensive grain are also excellent conditions for industrial development.

    First, the flaxseed oil pressing industry should be specially mentioned. The output of flaxseed in Chahar and Suiyuan provinces accounts for more than half of the total national output. Pure flaxseed oil is a mild oil and an important raw material for industry, which can be exported in large quantities. However, due to the underdeveloped oil pressing industry in our country and the impurity of the pressed oil (industrial use requires 95% purity), the export of raw materials (flaxseed) far exceeds the export of finished products (pure flaxseed oil). According to Tianjin Customs statistics, in 1934, 28,769 tons of flaxseed were exported, but only 700 kilograms of flaxseed oil were exported; in 1936, 36,810 tons of flaxseed were exported, but only 12,000 kilograms of flaxseed oil were exported. This is the situation of a semi-colonial economy. If the export of raw materials cannot be transformed into the export of finished products in the future, it will be extremely detrimental to the national economy. This year, Chahar and Suiyuan provinces have also planted a large amount of flaxseed, and the output is expected to double compared to the period under enemy rule. Chahar Province alone is estimated to harvest 14,000 tons this year, and the provincial government has made advance arrangements to improve planting and harvesting methods, implementing separate planting, harvesting, and threshing to obtain pure flaxseed as much as possible, thereby creating favorable conditions for pressing pure flaxseed oil. However, Chahar and Suiyuan provinces only have two machine oil pressing factories in Zhangjiakou (one public and one private), with a total daily output of 3.5 tons, which is far from the actual demand (according to people from the Zhangjiakou public oil pressing factory, 300 tons are needed for each export). Moreover, the products sometimes do not meet export standards. The oil pressing industry in Chahar and Suiyuan still needs substantial investment in technology and capital.

    Alkali Manufacturing Industry: The natural alkali in Suiyuan's Ikezhao League (also known as Yazi alkali) and Chahar's Kou alkali are famous. Tu alkali is produced near Etuoke in the Yimeng, about 800 miles southwest of Baotou. This is a large alkali lake with a circumference of hundreds of miles. Every spring, when the lake dries up, alkali crystals remain on the ground. The annual output is 215,000 tons, with the highest pure alkali content reaching 70%, and the ordinary ones also containing 50%. The locals regard it as loess, and the price is extremely low. Kou alkali is a specialty of Inner Mongolia, produced near Saihannaoer, about 600 miles north of Zhangjiakou. It is an alkali lake with a circumference of more than 40 miles. The annual output can reach more than 10 million catties when it is high, which is a crystal under the ice, containing one-third pure alkali. Alkali is a necessary raw material for industry. If the demand for alkali is high, it can illustrate the development of industry. At present, the surplus and low price of Yongli soda ash indicates an abnormal phenomenon in industrial development. When the whole country is liberated and industry gradually develops, and Yongli alkali is sold throughout the country (the south does not produce alkali), there will be a feeling of a large shortage. It is a major development to use the soil alkali and Kou alkali in the Northwest to make pure alkali. In order not to rely on foreign imports of soda ash, it is also necessary to develop.

    Starch Industry and Vermicelli Industry: Chahar North and Suiyuan are rich in potatoes. Because of the difficulty in exporting, the price is low, about one-tenth of the price in Beiping. Now potatoes are piled up like mountains in the Sui East area, only about 500 yuan per hundred catties. And potatoes are produced everywhere in Chahar North. According to Chahar merchants: a person can pick up thousands of catties of potatoes abandoned by farmers in Chahar North in seven or eight days. To make starch from it (textile mills need a lot of sizing), six to seven catties can produce one catty of starch. Transporting starch can save six to seven times the transportation capacity compared to transporting potatoes. If you make vermicelli from it, you can export a lot. The remaining residue from making starch and vermicelli can both feed pigs and fertilize the fields.

    Mechanized Flour Industry: This year, the area planted with wheat in the entire Chahar Province is about 8.4 million mu according to incomplete statistics. Wheat accounts for about 30% of the grain exported from Chahar Province each year. The wheat production in Suiyuan is even greater than that in Chahar Province. However, most of the flour mills in the two provinces are still old-fashioned flour mills. In addition, the quality of wheat is poor, and the flour milled can only be sold locally and cannot be sold elsewhere, resulting in a surplus. The Camel brand flour supervised by the Beiping Trading Company is also made from wheat. Due to better machinery and technology, the flour quality far exceeds the products of general flour mills in Zhangjiakou and Datong. There are a total of 204 flour mills in Zhangjiakou, only one private flour mill uses steel roller mills, and only a few use steel plate mills, while others still use stone mills. If new and larger flour mills are set up in Chahar and Suiyuan, there is no need to export wheat, and flour can be exported directly, saving about half of the transportation capacity.

    Pharmaceutical Industry: Chahar Province produces more than 40 kinds of mountain medicines such as red peony, ephedra, anemarrhena, ligusticum, polygala, scute, licorice, cynanchum, bupleurum, and rhubarb. According to incomplete statistics, the annual output of medicinal materials in the province reaches more than 25 million catties. The Datong Pharmaceutical Factory, which specializes in the production of ephedrine, is actively preparing to resume work, but the scale is not large. The Ping-Sui railway line and the surrounding area of Datong can produce more than 4 million catties of ephedra annually. Large-scale development still needs the efforts of the industrial sector.

    Leather Industry and Wool Spinning Industry: In addition to exporting a large amount of leather and fur from the Northwest, it also supplies the needs of the leather, carpet, and felt industries in Tianjin and Beijing. If the leather is made into semi-finished products and the wool is spun into yarn in Zhangjiakou, Datong, and Suiyuan, a lot of transportation capacity can be saved. Most of the more than 50 leather factories in Zhangjiakou are small-scale handicrafts, and most of them only aim to reduce costs and sell cheaply for the sake of temporary sales, without considering quality. They are unwilling to add enough roasted glue when soaking the leather, and the soaking time is insufficient, resulting in poor quality and unusable. Wool spinning is still mainly manual. Grain prices are low and labor is cheap in the Northwest. If wool is spun into yarn in Zhangjiakou, the cost can be reduced by 20% compared to spinning yarn in Tianjin and Beijing. If mechanical wool spinning is used, the cost can be further reduced. At present, although there is not much fur in Zhangjiakou, Datong and other places, this is only a temporary abnormal phenomenon. According to past statistics, from 1925 to 1929, 8 million pieces of leather and more than 10 million catties of various types of wool were imported into Zhangjiakou every year; after 1930, more than 2 million pieces of leather and more than 3 million catties of various types of wool were still imported into Zhangjiakou every year. Based on past experience, the source of fur will not be a problem in the future when trade with Inner Mongolia returns to normal, and both leather making and wool spinning have development potential.

    In addition, Suiyuan's Guisui, Wuchuan, and Gu'an produce asbestos, with a burial volume of about 119,000 tons; Wuchuan, Guyang, Xinghe, and the vicinity of Guisui produce black lead, with a burial volume of more than 10 million tons. Jining, Fengzhen, Guisui and other places produce mica, with a burial volume of 251,000 tons, and there are no special factories for mining. In addition, using farmers' useless cattle and sheep bones to make glue, refine oil, make pigments, and fertilize fields is also an industry with great development prospects.

    The Northwest's industrial technology is backward and lacks capital, and it needs foreign investment to develop industry. At present, it is facing the situation that some industries need to change their professions, and some industries are not suitable for development in certain cities and need to move factories. Based on the principle of "relying on raw materials," the Northwest is indeed a good place to invest. Zhangjiakou Mayor Sun once told the Beiping Industrial Tour Group: Under the goal of developing production and prospering the economy, Zhangjiakou welcomes assistance in technology and capital. If a factory is set up in Zhangjiakou, the People's Municipal Government will provide assistance within its capabilities.

　　工业投资的好地方
  　察绥工业资源介绍
    本报记者冯仲
    此次北平工业参观团赴察绥考察，在“就原料”的原则下，获悉察绥有许多资源值得利用乃至必须利用，以发展工业。另外，当地具有的下花园及口泉的煤，下花园的电力，廉价的粮食等则也是发展工业的优越条件。
    首先应特别提出的是胡麻榨油业，察绥两省的胡麻产量占全国总产量的半数以上。纯胡麻油为一种甘性油，是工业上重要的原料，可以大量出口；但因我国榨油业不发达，且榨出之油不纯（工业用需百分之九十五的成色），致出口之原料（胡麻）远超过成品（纯胡麻油）。据天津海关统计，一九三四年出口胡麻为二万八千七百六十九吨，出口之胡麻油仅七百公斤；一九三六年出口胡麻三万六千八百一十吨，出口之胡麻油一万二千公斤，这是半殖民地性经济存在的情况，今后若不能变原料出口为成品出口，对国家经济是极为不利的。本年察绥两省又大量种植胡麻，产量约可较敌人统治时增加一倍。仅察省今年估计可收获一万四千吨，且省府已预先布置改善种植和收割的方法，实行分种、分收、分打，尽量取得纯胡麻子，因之又形成榨纯胡麻油的有利条件；但察绥两省只有张家口现有机器榨油厂两家（公私营各一家），日产共三吨半，距实际需要相差甚远（据张家口公营榨油厂的人说，足三百吨才能出口一次），且产品有时尚达不到出口标准，察绥的榨油业尚需在技术上，资金上大量投资。
    制碱业：绥远伊克昭盟的土碱（又名牙子碱）、察北的口碱均为有名的天然碱。土碱产于包头西南约八百里伊盟的额托克附近。该处为一周围数百里的大碱湖，每年春季湖干时，碱的结晶品留于地面，年产二十一万五千吨，含纯碱成分最高可达百分之七十，普通的也可含百分之五十，当地视之如黄土，价极廉。口碱为内蒙之特产，产于距张家口北六百余里的塞汗诺尔附近，系一周围四十余里之碱湖，年产量多时可达一千余万斤，为一种冰下之结晶，含纯碱三分之一。碱为工业上必需的原料，如果碱的需用量多，就可说明工业的发展。目前永利碱面过剩价低，正表示工业发展之不正常现象。俟全国解放，工业日渐发展，永利碱行销全国（南方不产碱）时，将感到大量缺乏，利用西北的土碱和口碱制纯碱是有大发展的。为了不依赖外国输入碱面，也是必须发展的。
    淀粉业和粉丝业：察北和绥远盛产土豆，因为输出困难，价格低廉，约为北平市价的十分之一。现在绥东一带土豆堆积如山，每百斤仅五百元左右。而察北亦遍地皆产土豆。据察省商民谈：一个人到察北去七、八天，可以随地拾取农民遗弃的土豆千儿八百斤。以之制淀粉（纺织厂浆布大量需要），每六斤至七斤可出淀粉一斤，运出淀粉较运出土豆可节省运输力六至七倍。如以之制粉丝，更可大量出口。制淀粉、粉丝剩余之渣滓既可喂猪又能肥田。
    机制面粉业：本年全察省种植小麦的面积，据不完全的统计约八百四十余万亩。察省每年输出之粮食中的小麦约占百分之三十。绥远产小麦量尤盛于察省。但两省面粉厂大部仍是旧式磨面机，再加上口小麦质次，磨出之面粉只能销于当地，不能外销，致有过剩情形。北平贸易公司监制的骆驼牌面粉亦系以口小麦为原料，因机器设备及技术较佳，粉质则远超过张家口及大同等地一般面粉厂之出品。张家口市面粉业共二零四家，私营的面粉厂仅一家使用钢滚磨，用钢板磨的也只有少数的几家，其他均仍使用石磨。如在察绥设置新式较大的面粉厂，则不必输出小麦，直接输出面粉，可节省约一半的运输力。
    制药业：察省产赤芍、麻黄、知母、高本、远志、黄岑、甘草、蓁丸、柴胡、大黄等山药四十余种。据不完全的统计，全省年产药材达二千五百万斤以上。专制麻黄素的大同制药厂正在积极整理准备复工，但规模不大。平绥沿线铁道附近及大同周围年可产麻黄达四百余万斤，大量发展尚待工业界努力。
    制革业和纺毛业：西北的皮毛除大量出口外，并供给平津制革、地毯、制毡各业之需要，如在张家口、大同及绥远等地将皮革制成半成品，将羊毛纺成线再输出，可以节省很大运输力。张家口五十多家制革厂，多为小规模的手工业，且大都为了一时好销，只图减低成本廉卖，未考虑到质。泡皮时不肯加够用的烤胶，且泡皮时间不足，致品质低劣，不堪实用。纺毛现仍以手工为主，西北粮价低，人工便宜。如在张家口将毛纺成线，较在平津纺线可减低成本十分之二，如利用机械纺毛成本更可降低。目前张家口、大同等地虽然皮毛不多，这只不过是暂时不正常现象。过去统计，一九二五年至一九二九年每年输入张家口的皮革达八百万张，各种毛达一千多万斤；一九三○年以后每年输入张市者仍有皮革二百多万张，各种毛三百多万斤，根据过去情况，今后与内蒙贸易恢复正常，皮毛来源不致成问题，制革纺毛均有发展。
    此外绥远的归绥、武川、固安产石绵，埋藏量约十一万九千吨；武川、固阳、兴和、归绥附近产黑铅，埋藏量一千万余吨。集宁、丰镇、归绥等地产云母，埋藏量二十五万一千吨，均无专厂开采。另外，利用农民无用的牛羊骨制胶、炼油、制颜料及肥田粉。亦是很有发展前途的工业。
    西北工业技术落后，资金缺乏，需要外地投资发展工业。目前正面对着若干工业需要转业，若干工业则在某些城市不适合发展即需迁厂的情况，在“就原料的原则下，西北确是投资的好地方。张家口市孙市长曾向北平工业参观团表示：在发展生产，繁荣经济的目标下，张家口欢迎在技术上及资金上的帮助。如在张家口开设工厂，人民市政府将在可能范围内予以协助。
