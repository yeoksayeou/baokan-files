Beiping Electric Power Branch Company
　Holds a Mass Rally to Denounce the Crimes of Special Agents

　　[This City News] The North China Electric Power Company's Beiping Branch Company held a mass rally of over six hundred people yesterday morning (the 3rd) against special agents. In addition to employees from various business stations and substations in the city, Qinglongqiao Substation, and Shijingshan Power Plant under the company, representatives from the Chahar-Suiyuan Branch Company's Xiahuayuan Power Plant also rushed to participate. At the meeting, employees Zhang Jianmin, Liu Yan, Wu Zhonghui, Tang Jiaxiang, Wang Xiulan, and others successively denounced the atrocities of reactionary party and group special agents Zhang Zaizhong, Liang Weixian, and Chai Ruixiang in persecuting workers. Tang Jiaxiang, an employee of the Xiahuayuan Power Plant, first accused Zhang Zaizhong, the secretary of the 12th sub-branch of the Kuomintang Longyan District Party Department, who was using the name of workers in the Xiahuayuan Power Plant as a cover, of killing workers Xu Fengxiang and Zhang Xuetong, and persecuting workers Chen Sheng, Wang Peng, Zhang Kai, Meng Yunguang, and himself, along with over forty other people and the vast number of workers' families and local people. He said, "I am representing the workers of Xiahuayuan to demand a blood debt from Zhang Zaizhong!" Then, workers Zhang Jianmin and others from the Qinglongqiao Substation accused Cai Ruixiang, a local landlord, executive member of the Kuomintang Qinglongqiao District Branch, and current director of the Qinglongqiao Substation, of systematically spreading rumors after liberation to undermine the reputation of the People's Liberation Army and the People's Government, sabotaging factory security work, dampening workers' work morale, embezzling the company's water pump, substitute horse oil, machine oil, and workers' raincoats, and beating and abusing workers. Workers Liu Yan and others accused Liang Weixian, the deputy foreman of the power supply section, a Central Statistics Bureau (CC Bureau) special agent who had received special agent training at the Kuomintang Nanjing Pseudo-Training Corps and served as an executive member of the Kuomintang 20th District Party Department, of oppressing workers on weekdays, forcing workers to sabotage the student movement, and organizing a "anti-espionage and traitor elimination group" when the People's Liberation Army besieged the city. He did not confess truthfully during two registrations, attempting to continue his conspiracy and resolutely opposing the people and the revolution.
    After four hours, the workers who requested to speak and accuse were still very enthusiastic. Finally, after obtaining the consent of the workers present through the presidium of the conference, it was unanimously decided to request the administrative authorities to suspend the three incorrigible reactionary party and group special agents from their duties and salaries, and to request the Municipal Public Security Bureau to arrest and punish them to redress the grievances of the victims.

    【本市讯】华北电业公司北平分公司于昨（三）日上午举行六百余人的反特群众大会。除到有该公司所属城内各营业站、各变电站、青龙桥变电站、石景山发电所职工外，察中分公司下花园发电厂亦派代表赶来参加。会上，职工张健民、刘燕、吴钟慧、汤嘉祥、王秀兰等多人，纷纷控诉反动党团特务分子张在中、梁维贤、柴瑞祥等残害工人的暴行。下花园发电厂职工汤嘉祥，首先控诉以下花园发电厂工人名义作掩护的国民党龙烟区党部第十二区分部书记张在中杀害工友胥凤祥、张学桐，残害工友陈生、王鹏、张凯、孟云光和他自己等四十余人及广大工友家属以及当地群众的暴行。他说：“我是代表下花园的工友们，来向张在中讨血债的！”接着青龙桥变电所的工友张健民等，控诉当地大地主、国民党青龙桥区分部执行委员、现任青龙桥变电站主任蔡瑞祥在解放后有计划的散布谣言，破坏解放军及人民政府信誉；破坏工厂保卫工作，打击工友工作情绪；贪污公司绞水机、代马油、机器油及工人的雨衣，并打骂虐待工人等罪行。工友刘燕等控诉中统特务、曾在南京伪中训团受过特务训练、充当过国民党二十区党部执行委员的供电课副领班梁维贤，梁在平日欺压工人，强制工人破坏学运；在解放军围城时，布置“防谍锄奸小组”。两次登记，都不坦白，企图继续阴谋活动，坚决反人民反革命的罪行。
