    Provisional Regulations (Draft) for the Administration of Coal Mining in the Pingxi District of Beiping Municipality

    Chapter I: General Provisions

    Article 1: These regulations are specifically formulated to carry out long-term economic construction and protect and develop the coal mining industry in this district.

    Article 2: No one in this district may engage in mining without applying for and registering mining rights in accordance with the provisions of these regulations, being approved by the competent authority, and obtaining a license. During the mining period, they must be subject to the supervision and guidance of the government.

    Chapter II: Mining Rights

    Article 3: The provisions for mining areas are as follows:

    (1) The boundary of the mining area shall be determined by a straight line. The mining area's exploitation range is limited to the area included by the vertical line downwards from the boundary, and no mining beyond the boundary is allowed.

    (2) The area of the mining area is calculated based on the horizontal area within the boundary. (Each hectare is calculated as 10,000 square meters.)
    (3) Mining areas are divided into two sizes: large mining areas range from 10 hectares to 500 hectares, and those less than 10 hectares are small mining areas. (Each hectare is calculated as 10,000 square meters)

    Article 4: Adjacent mining areas shall be separated by at least 20 meters between large mines and at least 10 meters between small mines. If large and small mining areas are adjacent, the mining distance of the large mine shall prevail.

    Article 5: The term of mining rights is limited to 20 years for large mines and 5 years for small mines. If the mining term has expired but the mine intends to continue mining, an extension may be applied for.

    Article 6: The mining right shall take effect from the date of approval of registration and issuance of the license by the government.

    Those who have obtained mining rights before the implementation of these regulations must re-apply for registration, otherwise, it will be invalid. Those who are currently mining shall also submit an operating report (style attached separately) (omitted) and apply for registration within two months from the date of promulgation of these regulations. Mining can continue during the application period.

    Article 7: If two or more applicants apply for mining rights in the same mining area, those using mechanical mining shall have priority in registration. If both use mechanical mining, approval shall be granted in order of application.

    Article 8: If there are several kinds of minerals in the same mining area, secondary products may be mined in addition to the main product. Those who have not obtained the mining right for the main product but wish to mine the secondary product must obtain the consent of the original mining right holder before mining. Those who mine secondary products as mentioned above must apply for registration separately.

    Article 9: The mining of minerals is prohibited within 50 meters of cities, streets, villages, towns, railways, water conservancy projects, national defense projects, and other important buildings, unless otherwise specified.

    Article 10: Applicants for mining rights shall prepare three copies each of the application form and the mining area map and submit them to the local mining bureau or county government for forwarding to the Beiping Municipal Government for the issuance of a mining license and forwarding to the North China People's Government for record.

    The application form shall state the following items:

    ① Name, age, occupation, native place, and address (telephone number) of the applicant. ② Type and name of the coal mine. ③ Detailed address and area of the mining area. ④ Estimated reserves and mining volume. ⑤ Total capital. ⑥ Management method (public, private, joint public-private). ⑦ Business plan. ⑧ Proof documents from the local mining bureau or county government. ⑨ Application date.

    The mining area map shall indicate the following items:

    ① The orientation, distance, and area of the mining area. ② The place names and mountain names, water names, or permanent buildings near the mining area. ③ Indication of the north-south line. ④ The strike and dip of the coal seam outcrop (coal crop). The mining area map shall be calculated in meters (mining area map style attached separately) (omitted)

    Article 11: The position boundary and area of the mining area map shall be based on the distance angle between the base point and the measuring point of the mining area map. If the results are inconsistent when measured separately according to the two base points, the measurement of the first base point shall prevail.

    Article 12: Applicants for mining rights shall start mining within six months after obtaining the mining license and report the mining date, construction status, and main responsible technical personnel to the original approving authority. If mining is not started overdue without proper reason and there is no preparation for mining, the original approving authority may revoke the mining right.

    Article 13: After obtaining the mining license, the applicant for mining rights shall not lease it out privately or exploit it indiscriminately without a plan. Each coal mine shall report the construction situation and business status to the local competent authority and the Beiping Municipal Government for review in four installments in March, June, September, and December each year. If necessary, the local competent authority and the Beiping Municipal Government may send personnel to the coal mine for inspection. If it is less than three months, it shall also be calculated as one installment. (Report form attached separately) (omitted)

    Article 14: After the mining right is approved, the mining license shall be subject to taxation by the local tax collection agency in accordance with the law.

    Article 15: If the owner of the obtained mining right needs to make any changes to the mining area (such as increasing, decreasing, correcting, merging, or dividing the mining area), he shall prepare a change map and description and apply to the original approving authority for the change. If an independent operator transfers the coal mine or operates a joint-stock business and re-organizes the business by converting shares, he shall submit the reasons and details to the original approving authority for review and approval and forward it to the Beiping Municipal Government for record.

    Article 16: If the facilities of the coal mine need to occupy other people's land, houses, or trees, they shall first negotiate with the original owner and pay a considerable price to purchase or lease them. If there is a dispute between the two parties, the government shall arbitrate and resolve it.

    Article 17: If the mining of coal damages above-ground buildings or causes changes in soil quality that affect production, it shall be negotiated with the landowner for compensation. If there is a dispute between the two parties, the government shall arbitrate and resolve it.

    Article 18: The government retains the priority to purchase any minerals, and the miners shall not refuse.

    Article 19: If necessary, the government may recover the mining rights of the already mined mining area at any time, stop mining, and requisition part or all of its equipment according to the specific circumstances.
