　　Examples of US Imperialism Using Religion to Invade China
　　Rong Mengyuan
　　　　　American Missionaries in China Were the Vanguard of US Imperialism in China

　　Acheson said: "The concern of the American people and the government for China can be traced back to a very long time in our history. The religious, charitable, and cultural ties between the two nations have often strengthened American friendship with China."
　　Looking back at historical records, just in terms of American religion, it has been 119 years since it entered China in 1830 (the tenth year of the Daoguang Emperor's reign). According to statistics from American Remer (C.F. Remer) (New York, 1933, "Foreign Investment in China"):
Year　　　　　Number of Religious　Number of Missionaries　Percentage of American　US Religious　Percentage of Religious

Notes: ① Includes 9 Catholic organizations. ② Does not include Catholic missionaries. ③ Approximate figure. ④ US Consul in China reported $52.1 million in 1928.

　　From this table, we can see that the American religious forces in China are expanding daily; from the fact that American missionaries account for almost half of the total number of Americans in China, we can see the importance of American religion in the aggression against China. The United States sends many religious organizations and missionaries to China, which in essence is just as Jesus said: "No one can enter a strong man’s house and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong man. Then indeed he may plunder his house." (Mark 3:27); "They come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves." (Matthew 7:15)
　　The first American Christian missionary to China in 1830 was Reverend Elijah Bridgman. Later, Reverend Elijah Coleman Bridgman and Reverend Peter Parker came, and they initially lived in Guangzhou, starting a hospital (the Boji Hospital) in Guangzhou in 1835. The main purpose of the United States in sending missionaries to China was to investigate the situation in China and prepare for aggression against China. Therefore, missionaries had to make investigation reports to the American government. In 1841 (the 21st year of the Daoguang Emperor's reign), Reverend Peter Parker personally went to Washington to report to the US senators and representatives (Guang Xuehui Publishing House: "Liang Fa"). Elijah Bridgman said very frankly in a home letter: "We who preach in China are more due to political reasons than religious reasons." From this, it can be understood that the American missionaries who came to China were the vanguard of American aggression against China.
　　During the Opium War, Britain invaded China, and the United States followed suit. The American missionaries who had already come to China formally put on their aggressive faces. In 1844 (the 24th year of the Daoguang Emperor's reign), the United States sent Caleb Cushing to China to force the Qing government to sign the Treaty of Wangxia. The main personnel assisting Cushing in signing the treaty were Reverend Elijah Bridgman and Reverend Peter Parker. Relying on these pastors familiar with the Chinese situation, the United States not only obtained rights such as the opening of five ports for trade in China, but also obtained extraterritoriality for the first time (Article 21 of the Treaty of Wangxia), the right to preach (only in the five trading ports), and the right to purchase land (Article 17).
　　Although China's door was opened, the United States still needed to continue investigating the situation in China in order to expand its aggression in China. The most qualified investigators who could go deep into various regions and contact all levels of society were of course missionaries in religious disguise. Therefore, after Shanghai was opened as a port, "Although the United States focused on commerce, the first Americans to arrive in Shanghai were all missionaries. As soon as they arrived, they lived inside and outside the city and immediately reported the situation they witnessed to their head office in their own country." (Ernest O. Hauser: "Shanghai: Paradise of Adventurers") In 1850 (the 30th year of the Daoguang Emperor's reign), American missionary William Alexander Parsons Martin came to China. He knew that "according to the treaty, he was never allowed to enter the interior" to preach, but he said stubbornly: "We are commanded by the Lord (should be the command of the American aggressors) to preach to all directions. Even if there is secular obstruction, how can it be stopped?" (William Alexander Parsons Martin: "A Cycle of Cathay") He and Reverend Lan preached in Hangzhou and other places. During this period, American missionaries not only investigated the situation in the Chinese mainland for the American government, but also put forward bloody methods to harm the Chinese people. An American missionary said: "This Chinese nation will eventually be conquered by foreigners. Although it is inevitable to kill a few more people, it does not matter." ("Shanghai: Paradise of Adventurers") Every Chinese should remember firmly: American evil missionaries are trying to "conquer" the Chinese nation and "kill more" Chinese people. They are our enemies.
　　In 1858 (the eighth year of the Xianfeng Emperor's reign), the British and French allied forces invaded China, and the United States also participated. William Alexander Parsons Martin, a missionary who had lived in China for a long time, assisted the American Minister to force the Qing government to sign a treaty infringing on China's sovereignty in Tianjin. The Sino-American Tianjin Treaty was not only signed the earliest (signed on June 18, the British treaty was on the 26th, and the French treaty was on the 27th), but also "the article on believing in and preaching the Gospel first came from the American treaty, and the British treaty followed suit." ("A Cycle of Cathay"). The United States used religious organizations and missionaries to open up the road of aggression against China; in turn, it wrote the preaching section into the treaty and used political power to protect the aggressive behavior of religious organizations and missionaries. This is the mystery of Article 29 of the Sino-American Tianjin Treaty, that China should "show compassion and protection to those who preach and practice religion, and must not harass them"; and all the clauses protecting missionaries in other treaties; that is, the relationship between the American government and American religions in China for more than 100 years.

　　　　American Evil Missionaries Used Privileges to Poison the Chinese People

　　Before the First World War, Catholicism in China was mainly the power of French imperialism, without the share of the United States; while Christianity was mainly the power of the United States. In 1861 (the eleventh year of the Xianfeng Emperor's reign), France forced the Qing government to give Catholicism many privileges, such as "local officials must show respect to the clergy"; if the clergy "have cases to present to local officials, the local authorities shall also make fair judgments (that is, they must satisfy the clergy)"; Catholic believers are exempt from local levies ("Edicts on the Propagation of Religion"), etc. At that time, the American religion was still small in China and had not requested examples. Later, when the American religion expanded its power in China, in 1881 (the seventh year of the Guangxu Emperor's reign), the American Minister Angell used the excuse of "equal sharing of benefits" to propose to the Qing government: "Christian believers shall also receive the benefits that Catholic believers receive." ("The General Administration Consults on Matters within the Edicts on the Propagation of Religion, and Christian Matters Shall Be Handled in the Same Manner") From then on, American Christianity gained the same privileges as Catholicism in China, and American missionaries were able to poison the people more conveniently in various places.
　　In 1881, American missionary John Murray and Hong Shitifan forcibly bought Jiao Tongxing's house in Jinan; the American church forcibly occupied the foundation of the house of Wu Xia, a widow in Dezhou ("Historical Materials on Religious Cases in the Late Qing Dynasty" 2); in 1882, American missionary Mulliner forcibly occupied Zheng Yonghe's shop in Shantou ("Collection of Memorials on Religious Cases" Volume 6); in 1907 (the thirty-third year of the Guangxu Emperor's reign), "American pastors Li Lisheng and Shi Daoge bought land one after another on Jigong Mountain in Xinyang Prefecture, Henan Province, and resold it for profit" ("Kaifeng Road Consults with American Consul Madun on Commercial Matters on Jigong Mountain"). These are examples of land grabbing.
　　In 1879 (the fifth year of the Guangxu Emperor's reign), American missionary Xue Chengen scolded Chinese children and shot and injured Chen Gui, a Chinese civilian, in Yanping County, Fujian ("Historical Materials on Religious Cases in the Late Qing Dynasty" 2); in 1886 (the twelfth year of the Guangxu Emperor's reign), the "Religious Leader of Chongqing, Luo Yuanyi" and others beat Chongqing residents, "causing 22 Chongqing residents to be injured and 11 killed"; at the same time, in "Jiangbei Hall in Sichuan, more than 400 shops were burned down by religious believers" ("Diplomatic Historical Materials of the Late Qing Dynasty" Volume 67). These are examples of murder and arson.
　　In 1874 (the first year of the Guangxu Emperor's reign), "American missionary He opened a Huashantang in Jiujiang City. A stonemason shop child was locked up and not released" ("Comprehensive Examination of Current Affairs" Volume 18), this is an example of abducting and kidnapping people. In 1880 (the sixth year of the Guangxu Emperor's reign), there was an American missionary, Lu Pinru, in Qingyuan County, Guangdong, who seduced women ("Qingyuan County Reports to the Governor-General of Liangguang"), this is an example of adultery.
　　In 1887 (the fourteenth year of the Guangxu Emperor's reign), American missionary Xiang Bianwen wrote to Heshan County, Guangdong, to help Li Jinghu seize the property of his great-aunt Li Huang ("Heshan County Reports to the Governor-General of Liangguang"), which is an example of soliciting litigation. In particular, soliciting litigation was the most common. Missionaries could not only profit from it, but also take the opportunity to recruit hooligans and local bullies into the church and make them act as traitors and running dogs. Therefore, kind people were heartbroken and often spontaneously launched mass anti-imperialist struggles, and the target of the struggle was first of all the church. After the Yihetuan anti-imperialist movement in 1900 (the 26th year of the Guangxu Emperor's reign), even the Christian missionary Timothy Richard proposed that "to permanently end religious cases, Chinese officials should treat religious believers as they treat non-religious people, treating them equally" ("Regulations on Handling Religious Cases in Shanxi"). Graves, the chief pastor of England, also proposed that the church "cannot be a refuge for Chinese criminals"; missionaries "should be immediately dismissed if they engage in private protection and malpractice; no one, whether with official affairs pending or in litigation with others, shall be allowed to join the church" ("Regulations on the Interaction between Chinese Religious Believers and Officials"). These two regulations were of course not implemented later, but it can be seen from this that the church missionaries' crimes of soliciting litigation.
　　Professor Jia Lunpo of the United States said that missionaries were engaged by "people who have accomplished nothing" ("Fifty Years of Self-Description of Ouchu"). Coming to China to preach, "the pastors appointed by the United States often regard serving the church as a purely bread-and-butter issue; they engage in all businesses that are considered profitable, and many pastors also engage in buying and selling land speculation" (Waldersee: "Boxer Rebellion Notes"). These many evil and domineering behaviors of American church missionaries that poisoned the Chinese people were all carried out with the support of the American government. The invaders took the church as the center to create their own power. As a result, "countless enemy countries, self-governing and autonomous" appeared in China ("The General Administration's Letter to Ministers of Western Countries") that were not under the jurisdiction of the Chinese government, turning many Chinese territories into colonies in disguise. Based on this, they expanded outwards, attempting to turn the whole of China into a colony; and through church missionaries to protect thugs and bandits, and buy over traitors to act as pawns for the invasion of China, this is the reason why the United States supported church missionaries. During the approximately 60 years from the Opium War to the Sino-Japanese War, the United States always used missionaries as the vanguard to invade China, and American religion basically used coercive methods to make the Qing government accept its demands.

　　　　The Collusion between the American Church and the Chinese Reactionary Ruling Class

　　At the end of the 19th century, the United States had already formed imperialism, but its power in China was not as good as that of British, Russian, French, German, and Japanese imperialism. Therefore, it changed its method of aggression, attempting to enslave the Chinese people through the Chinese reactionary rulers. This conspiracy of the United States was first proposed to the Qing government by missionaries. British and American missionaries organized a Guangxuehui in China. Chinese reformers such as Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao once had illusions about the Guangxuehui and were also influenced by the Guangxuehui. The Guangxuehui flaunted its assistance to China's "reform," but in reality, it wanted to turn China into a colony. In 1895 (the 21st year of the Guangxu Emperor's reign), Timothy Richard, one of the leaders of the Guangxuehui, presented a memorial to the Qing Emperor called "New Policies," advising the Qing government to implement new policies. He taught the Qing government to set up a new policy department to take overall charge of all administration, and the person in charge of this new policy department should be British and American; the Qing Emperor should use British and Americans as consultants, use Germans and Americans to manage the Ministry of Education, and use Guangxuehui missionaries, British man Fu Lanya and American man Li Jiabai, to manage the National Daily. In short, the Guangxuehui missionaries helping the Qing government "reform" was for British, American, German and other imperialists to jointly manage China.
　　In 1899 (the 25th year of the Guangxu Emperor's reign), the United States opposed the partitioning of China (because the United States had little power in China, and the partitioning of China would not benefit the United States). Secretary of State John Hay announced the policy of "Open Door, Equal Opportunity," which meant that the United States must jointly squeeze the Chinese people with other imperialists, but still preserve China's name. This policy of the United States was made more specific by the missionary William Alexander Parsons Martin. In 1900, when the Eight-Power Allied Forces invaded China, William Alexander Parsons Martin presented a memorial to the Beijing Legation Corps. He advocated preserving the Qing Emperor, jointly managing the Qing government by various countries, and delineating the spheres of influence of each imperialist in China. Each country would send one person to manage the provincial governments; the countries would set up a public association as an organization to jointly discuss the rule of China. He said that this way, "we can get the help of wise Chinese (traitors), and what we get is more than dividing." He particularly emphasized: "To govern China, we must use Chinese. There is no other way." Using Chinese to govern Chinese can both paralyze a part of the Chinese people and alleviate the Chinese people's fierce resistance; and use the Chinese big landlords and compradors who know best how to rule the Chinese people to suppress the Chinese people's resistance, while imperialism actually rules the Chinese nation. The imperialists adopted William Alexander Parsons Martin's method, and since 1900, they have enslaved the Chinese people through reactionary rulers such as Nara, Yuan Shikai, Duan Qirui, and Chiang Kai-shek. And American religion especially helped the Chinese reactionary regime everywhere. First, the American missionary Lin Lezhi wanted to use "power to open up Chinese bureaucrats" ("Guangxuehui 50th Anniversary Newsletter" Issue 4); later, the American church openly supported the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang; and invaded China through these counter-revolutionary regimes.
　　Chiang Kai-shek came to power mainly relying on the support of US imperialism. He joined the American Methodist Church in Song's Shanghai private residence on October 23, 1930. According to the Chiang family's official book "The Private Life of the Chairman and His Wife": "This conversion to Christianity was influenced by his mother-in-law and wife and was a political act." That is to say, Chiang Kai-shek believed in American religion, and American Christianity was the bodyguard for Chiang Kai-shek. During the Anti-Japanese War, US imperialism attempted to sacrifice China in exchange for a compromise with Japan. The Xingtai American Presbyterian Church (led by American missionary Zhen Kaisi) led the "North China Christian Joint Promotion Association" to issue a declaration saying: "Based on the original purpose of coexistence and co-prosperity, the integration of politics and religion, and the revival of the evangelistic camp." It openly helped Japanese imperialism to destroy China. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the United States attempted to monopolize China. In 1946, the American missionary Stuart Lei Deng, who ran church schools in China, became the American ambassador to China. Representing US imperialism, he supported Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorship, betrayal of the country, and civil war. His followers also followed behind the US-Chiang's ass, clamoring for "suppressing the rebellion" and directly becoming enemies of the Chinese people.

　　　　The Anti-People Activities of the Catholic Church in China and the War Criminal Yu Bin

　　After the First World War, the French forces that invaded China declined, and the American forces increased. As a result, the American Catholic organizations also ran into China. Fu Jen Catholic University was established based on the proposal passed by the All-American Benedictine Conference on August 7, 1923 (Hangzhou Catholic Church Publishing House: "The Holy Religion and China"). By 1930, there were a total of nine American Catholic organizations in China. They obtained dioceses in Guangdong, Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and along the Yangtze River, mainly in Chiang Kai-shek's base areas. Yu Bin, the Bishop of the Nanjing Diocese and the general supervisor of the "Chinese National Catholic Association," this American running dog, a Fascist Doctor of Political Science who had won medals from the Italian Fascist bandits, helped the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang oppose the Chinese people when Chiang Kai-shek carried out ten years of anti-people civil war and relied on the United States to surrender to Japanese imperialism. His followers confessed: Yu Bin "made great contributions to our country's revitalization movement (Fascist movement) and national defense plan (massacre of the people, surrender to imperialism). Therefore, the chairman and important figures of the national government (Chiang bandits and their pawns) all value him very much." ("A Brief Biography of Archbishop Yu"). After American Catholicism entered China with the American aggressive forces, it immediately helped the Chinese counter-revolutionary bandit gangs to harm the Chinese people and expand American aggression against China. Before American Catholicism entered China, no Chinese was a bishop. After American Catholicism entered China, in 1926, there were six Chinese bishops at once, and the number of Chinese bishops continued to increase thereafter. This can be said to be another performance of the American "using Chinese to control Chinese" policy. This policy played a part in paralyzing the Chinese people. People like Yu Bin, who acted as running dogs for US imperialism as Chinese, would initially make some people unable to see his true colors clearly. Secondly, Chiang Kai-shek seized power not long after American Catholicism entered China. Chiang Kai-shek needed support from all aspects of the United States and even more the assistance of Fascist Yu Bin. In addition, French imperialism itself was aging. As a result, the American Catholic forces were able to expand rapidly in China.
　　In 1939, Pacelli became the Pope, "and he was especially close to Roosevelt. Roosevelt sent a special envoy to the Vatican to cooperate with the Pope" ("The Pope in the Vatican"). Since then, the United States has controlled the Pope, and Chinese Catholicism has almost all become American forces. Catholicism controlled by the United States has always been anti-Soviet, anti-communist, and anti-Chinese people during the Anti-Japanese War. Especially when the United States was preparing to compromise with Japan, this reactionary activity was particularly rampant. In May 1941, the 55th issue of "Sacred Heart News" insulted the Soviet Union as "a Russian with a ferocious face"; slandered the Chinese Communist Party as a "branch of the Soviet Union"; and slandered the anti-Japanese people as standing behind Stalin, "patriotic gentlemen who can shout slogans, write slogans, and sing national salvation songs." The American lackeys in Catholicism were then running dogs of the Japanese invaders.
　　After the end of the Anti-Japanese War, Yu Bin founded the "Catholic Cultural Advancement Association" in Nanjing, attempting to establish branches in 130 dioceses across the country and attempting to publish the "Yishi Bao" in 25 major cities across the country, planning to make all Catholics in the country become American forces and help the Chiang-Americans to squeeze the Chinese people. Therefore, Yu Bin was promoted by the Pope to Archbishop of the Jiangsu Diocese. When Yu Bin held the inauguration ceremony on New Year's Day in 1947, the Papal Envoy Li Peili delivered a speech, openly saying that Catholicism would assist the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's "nation-building work"; on January 21, Yu Bin and others called themselves "Northeast People's Delegation" and requested Chiang Kai-shek to "quickly recover the sovereignty of various places in the Northeast" ("Yishi Weekly"). Not only that, Yu Bin was also a representative of the Chiang bandits' pseudo-national congress and was one of the members of the presidium of the pseudo-national congress. This important accomplice of the US-Chiang bandit gang is precisely the war criminal that the people want to arrest and try.

　　　　The Special Agent Activities of the US Church in China in the Victory of the Chinese People

　　In the People's Liberation War, the people's strength grew unprecedentedly, and the US-Chiang failed militarily and politically. As a result, they strengthened special agent activities and infiltrated the liberated areas to sabotage. The liberated areas implemented a policy of freedom of religious belief, and the US-Chiang relied on some evil missionaries to carry out conspiracies and sabotage in the liberated areas. For example, the Xingtai Catholic Church distributed anti-communist pamphlets compiled by the American priest Fal Tanl Sheend, taught children to sing "anti-communist tunes" in the seminary, and used the opportunity to preach to spread rumors saying: "The Kuomintang army will arrive in less than a month." And they hid Gao Lianjiu, the chief person in charge of the Jinnan Third Youth League, arranged special agent work in Xingtai, and protected Gao Delin and 43 other traitors from escaping the people's arrest and trial. Finally, they escorted them to escape to Shimen (which had not yet been liberated at that time); they even secretly hid more than 60 firearms, attempting to organize a riot to welcome the Chiang bandit army to invade Xingtai; other crimes such as poisoning, shooting secretly, and sending information to the US-Chiang are countless. It was not until the evil missionaries Ge Lecai and others were discovered by the people of Xingtai at the end of 1946 that the anti-people activities were extinguished. In other places such as Shandong, Hebei, and Northeast, many of the bandits and special agents captured by the people were evil missionaries, and many were lurking in Catholic churches. In the words of Jesus: the church was originally "a house of prayer, but you have made it a den of thieves" (Matthew 21:13). With the victory of the People's Liberation War and the collapse of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, the US religious invasion of China has also shifted to a new model, that is, using the freedom of belief in the liberated areas to allow special agent bandit gangs to use the cloak of religion to undermine the people's regime and all the people's interests, attempting to preserve reactionary forces in order to take the opportunity to restore.
　　When American religion invaded China, they ran some newspapers and schools in China, which played a slightly progressive role in China's acceptance of capitalist culture. It is precisely because of this role that it is easy to paralyze people and ignore its essence of aggression. Ge Gongzhen said about imperialism running newspapers in China: "The purpose of foreign newspapers is to preach and promote commerce. Their remarks and records are closely related to their country's diplomatic policies, following every step without any chaos." ("History of Chinese Journalism") The Japanese said about imperialism running schools in China: "The Western countries implement colonial strategies, and even education is one of them. From the beginning of colonization, they send missionaries to spread Christianity and subtly change the brains of their people to assimilate them. Now, the power of English education in China has many potential forces, using education as a source of supporting forces." ("Educational Times" published in 1902). The person in charge of the London Chamber of Commerce in England said more clearly: Saving a few minutes of advertising costs and giving it to pastors to run schools in China will not only train students, but even the students' family and friends will promote for us. This is much better than that dead advertisement (Gu Mei: "Modern China and Its Education"). American missionaries running newspapers and schools in China is one thing to infringe on China's sovereignty and another thing to cultivate American forces. What US imperialism is pinning its hopes on now is mainly to use the so-called democratic individualists it has cultivated in the past, and it still attempts to continue to cultivate such people in the future. However, the Chinese people, except for a very small number of national scum, the vast majority stand on the side of the people and will never be fooled by US imperialism again.
　　The above are just a few examples. The crimes of American religious aggression against China are endless. We do advocate and conscientiously implement a policy of freedom of religious belief, but we will never tolerate imperialists using religion—whether Christianity or Catholicism—to invade China, oppose the Chinese people, and help counter-revolutionary bandit gangs to undermine the Chinese people's liberation cause. "Can the Chinese people not hate those who hypocritically use the name of spreading Christianity to cover up the policy of plunder?" We, the Chinese people, hate Acheson's so-called "connection" between American religion and China to the extreme. American evil missionaries who were sent to invade China, go all over the oceans and lands to fill up the evil of your ancestors. How can you, you snakes, you brood of vipers, escape the punishment of the people!

　　美帝利用宗教侵华举例
    荣孟源
  　　　　　美国来华教士是美帝侵华的先遣军
    艾奇逊说：“美国人民与政府对中国的关切，可以在我们的历史上追溯到很远的时期。结合两民族的宗教上慈善事业上以及文化上的联系，常使美国对中国的友谊加强。”
    翻开历史记载来看看，只说美国宗教，从一八三○年（道光十年）进入中国以后，到今天已有一百一十九年了。根据美国人里玛（Ｃ．Ｆ．Ｒｅｍｅｒ）的统计（一九三三年纽约出版：“外国在华投资”）：年代　　　　派到中国　派到中国　　在华美国教　　美国对华　　宗教投资
　　　　　　的宗教团　的教士人　　士与在华美　　宗教投资　　与对华投
　　　　　　体数　　　数　　　　　侨总数的百　　（单位万　　资总数的

    从这个表中我们可以看出，美国宗教势力在中国日益扩张；从美国教士占美国来华总人数的几乎一半，更可以看出美国宗教在侵略中国行为上的重要性。美国派遣许多宗教团体和教士到中国来，就其本质说，正和当年耶稣所说的一样：“没有人能进壮士的家里，抢夺他的家具；必先捆住那壮士，才可以抢他的家。”（“马可福音”第三章）；“他们到你们这里来，外面披着羊皮，里面却是残暴的狼。”（“马太福音”第七章）
    一八三○年美国第一个来到中国的基督教士，是裨治文牧师。随后又来了雅裨理牧师和伯驾牧师等人，起初他们都住在广州，一八三五年开始在广州办医院（博济医院）。美国派遣教士们到中国来，主要目的是调查中国情形，准备侵略中国，于是教士要向美国政府做调查报告，一八四一年（道光二十一年）伯驾牧师还亲身到华盛顿，向美国参众议员做过报告（广学会出版：“梁发”）。裨治文在家信中说得很坦白，他说：“我等在中国传教之人，与其说是由于宗教之原因，无宁说是由于政治之原因。”由此可以明白，美国来中国的教士，是美国侵略中国的先遣队。
    雅片战争，英国侵入中国，美国也赶上来了，美国早已来到中国的教士们，正式摆出他们的侵略面孔。一八四四年（道光二十四年），美国派遣古诚来中国强迫满清政府签订“望厦条约”，协助古诚订约的主要人员，就是裨治文牧师和伯驾牧师。美国依靠这些熟悉中国情况的牧师们，在中国不仅获得五口通商等权利，而且第一个获得了治外法权（“望厦条约”第二十一款）、传教权（仅在通商五口）和置买地产权（第十七款）。
    中国大门虽然打开了，但是美国要在中国扩大侵略，还须继续调查中国情形。能够深入各地和各阶层接触的调查员，当然以蒙着宗教外衣的教士为最合格。于是上海开埠以后，“美国所注重的虽在商业，但第一批到上海的美国人则都是教士。他们一到之后，就在城里城外住了下来，立刻把目击的地方情形报告他们本国的总机关。”（Ｅｒｎｅｓｔ
　Ｏ．Ｈａｕｓｅｒ：“出卖上海滩”）一八五○年（道光三十年）美国教士丁韪良来到中国，他明知道“按条约，终不许入内地”传教，但是他蛮横地说：“吾人奉主命（应是奉美国侵略者之命），传教万方，即有世俗阻止，安能阻哉，”（丁韪良：“花甲忆记”）硬和兰牧师到杭州等地传教。这期间美国教士不止替美国政府调查中国内地情形，而且还提出了血腥地残害中国人民的办法。有一个美国教士说：“中国这个民族，终久要被外国人所征服，虽然免不了要多杀死几个人，也是无关紧要的。”（“出卖上海滩”）每一个中国人都应当牢牢记住：美国恶教士是企图“征服”中国民族、“多杀”中国人民的，他们是我们的仇敌。
    一八五八年（咸丰八年），英法联军侵略中国，美国也参加了。久住中国的丁韪良教士，协助美公使首先到天津逼迫满清政府签订侵害中国主权的条约。“中美天津条约”不仅签订得最早（六月十八日签字，英约是二十六日，法约是二十七日），而且“奉教传道一节，系先出于美约，而英约仿照也”（“花甲忆记”）。美国用宗教团体与教士开辟侵略中国的道路；回头把传教一节写在条约上面，再用政治力量保护宗教团体与教士的侵略行为。这就是“中美天津条约”第二十九款，中国对于“传教习教之人，当一体矜恤保护，毋得骚扰”；以及其他条约中一切保护教士条款的奥妙；也就是美国侵略中国，一百余年来，美国政府与来华美国宗教的关系。
    　　　　美国恶教士利用特权，毒害中国人民
    第一次帝国主义世界大战以前，在中国的天主教，主要是法帝国主义的势力，没有美国的份；而基督教则主要是美国的势力。一八六一年（咸丰十一年），法国硬逼满清政府给天主教许多特权，如对教士“地方官务须示以体面”；教士“如有向地方官呈诉事件者，地方亦即公平剖断（即必使教士满意）”；教民免除地方滩派（“传教谕单”）等等。那时美国宗教在中国力量尚小，未曾援例要求。后来美国宗教在中国的势力扩大了，一八八一年（光绪七年），美国安公使就借口“实惠均沾”，向满清政府提出：“耶稣教民亦受天主教民得受之益。”（“总署传教谕单内事宜耶稣教一律办理咨”）从此美国基督教在中国获得和天主教同样的特权，美国教士得在各地更便利地毒害人民。
    一八八一年美国教士莫约翰与洪士提反在济南强买焦同兴的房屋；美国教会在德州强占寡妇吴夏氏的房基（“清季教案史料”二）；一八八二年美教士目为霖在汕头强占郑永合的店房（“教案奏议汇编”卷六）；一九○七年光绪三十三年）“美国牧师李立生与施道格在豫省信阳州鸡公山先后买地，辗转租卖，作为图利计”（“开封道致美领事马墩商办鸡公山照会）。这是霸产的实例。
    一八七九年（光绪五年），美教士薛承恩在福建延平县詈骂中国幼童，开枪击伤中国平民陈贵（“清季教案史料”二）；一八八六年（光绪十二年），美教会“重庆教首罗元义”等，殴打重庆居民，“致渝民被伤二十二人，伤毙十一人”；同时四川“江北厅地方，被教民烧毁铺房四百余家”（“清季外交史料”卷六十七）。这是杀人放火的实例。
    一八七四年（光绪元年），九江城内“美国赫教士，开设化善堂一所，有石匠店小孩，被堂内关闭不放”（“时务通考”卷十八），这是拐迷人口的实例。一八八○年（光绪六年），广东清远县有美国教士鲁聘儒，引诱妇女（“清远县禀两广督院”），这是奸淫的实例。
    一八八七年（光绪十四年），美教士香便文致函广东鹤山县，帮助李镜湖霸占其叔祖母李黄氏的产业（“鹤山县禀两广督院”），是包揽词讼的实例。特别是包揽词讼，最为普遍，教士不止可以从中获利，而且趁机收罗流氓地痞入教，使他们充当汉奸走狗。因此善良的人民痛心疾首，经常自发地兴起群众性的反帝斗争，而斗争的目标，首先是教会。一九○○年（光绪二十六年）义和团反帝运动以后，连基督教士李提摩太都提出，“要永息教案，中国官待教民当如待教外人，一视同仁”（“拟办山西耶稣教案章程”）。英国大掌教格雷孚斯也提出，教会“不能为中国罪人之逋逃薮”；教士“如有行私袒庇情弊，亦当即时革去；无论何人，或有官事未了，或将与他人＠讼者，均不得入教”（“拟中国教民与官场交涉章程”）。这两种章程后来当然不会实行，但从此可以看出教会教士包揽词讼的罪行。
    美国嘉伦坡教授说，教士都是“一事无成之人”所干的（“藕初五十自述”）。到中国来传教，“美国方面所委任之牧师，常以服务教会为纯粹面包问题；凡认为可赚钱之业务，无不兼营并进，许多牧师，兼做买卖土地投机事业”（瓦德西：“拳乱笔记”）。美国教会教士这许多毒害中国人民的恶霸行为，都是由美国政府撑持着进行的。侵略者以教堂为中心，造成自己的势力，于是中国境内出现了“无数敌国，自专自主”（“总署致各西国大臣书”）不受中国政府的管辖，使许多中国领土，无形中变成殖民地。并以此为基点，向外扩大，企图使全中国都变做殖民地；并且通过教会教士包庇棍痞匪类，收买汉奸，充做侵略中国的爪牙，这就是美国支持教会教士的原因。从鸦片战争到甲午战争约六十年间，美国侵略中国，总是用教士为先遣队，美国宗教基本上是用强迫的方式使满清政府接受它的要求。
    　　　　美国教会与中国反动统治阶级的勾结
    十九世纪末，美国已经形成为帝国主义，但是它在中国的势力，还比不上英、俄、法、德、日等帝国主义，于是它便改变侵略方法，企图通过中国的反动统治者来奴役中国人民。美国这种阴谋，首先由教士向满清政府提出来。英美教士在中国组织了一个广学会，中国的改良主义者如康有为梁启超等人，曾经对广学会发生过幻想，也曾受了广学会的影响。广学会标榜着帮助中国“维新”，可是实际上要把中国变为殖民地。一八九五年（光绪二十一年），广学会的首领之一李提摩太给满清皇帝上了一个条陈，名叫“新政策”，劝满清政府实行新政。他教满清政府设立一个新政部，总管一切行政，而这个新政部的负责人要用英国人和美国人；满清皇帝要用英国人和美国人为顾问，用德国人和美国人管理学部，用广学会的教士英人傅兰雅和美人李佳白管理国家日报。总之，广学会的教士帮助满清政府“维新”，就是由英美德等帝国主义来共同管理中国。
    一八九九年（光绪二十五年），美国反对瓜分中国（因为美国在中国的势力小，瓜分中国对美国无利），国务卿海约翰宣布“门户开放，机会均等”的政策，就是说美国必须和其他帝国主义共同来压榨中国人民，但是还保存着中国的名义。美国这种政策经过教士丁韪良更具体化了。一九○○年八国联军侵略中国的时候，丁韪良给北京公使团上过一个条陈。他主张保存满清皇帝，由各国共同管理满清政府，各帝国主义在中国划清了势力范围，每国派一人管理各省政府；各国再设一个公会，做为共同商讨统治中国的机关。他说这样“且得智慧华人（汉奸）之助，其所得者较瓜分为多也”。他特别强调：“治中国须以华人，无他术也。”以华治华，既可以使一部分中国人麻痹，缓和中国人民激烈地反抗；又可以使用最懂得统治中国人民的中国大地主大买办等汉奸国贼镇压中国人民的反抗，而帝国主义却实际上统治着中国民族。各帝国主义采用了丁韪良的方法，从一九○○年以来，通过那拉氏、袁世凯、段祺瑞、蒋介石等反动统治者来奴役中国人民。而美国宗教尤其处处帮助中国的反动政权。先有美国教士林乐知要用“力量来开通中国的官僚”（“广学会五十周纪念短讯”第四期）；后有美国教会公然支持蒋介石匪帮；通过这些反革命政权来侵略中国。
    蒋介石上台主要是依靠美帝国主义撑腰，他于一九三○年十月二十三日在宋家上海私邸里加入美以美派教会。据蒋家官书“委员长夫妇的私人生活”说：“这次信奉基督教是受了他岳母与妻子的感化，是一种政治行动”。就是说蒋介石信奉美国宗教，美国基督教替蒋介石保镖。抗日战争期间，美帝国主义曾企图牺牲中国以换取与日本的妥协，邢台美国长老会（首领是美教士甄开司）就领导着“华北基督教联合促进会”发表宣言说：“本乎共存共荣之原旨，政教合一，复兴布道阵容。”公然帮助日本帝国主义灭亡中国。抗战胜利以后，美国企图独占中国，一九四六年美国在华办教会学校的司徒雷登牧师，做了美国驻华大使。代表美帝国主义支持蒋介石的独裁、卖国和内战。他的喽ｌｕｏ＠①也跟在美蒋的屁股后面，叫嚣着“戡乱”，直接和中国人民为敌。
    　　　　在华天主教会及战犯于斌的反人民活动
    第一次帝国主义世界大战以后，侵略中国的法国势力衰落，美国势力增长，于是美国天主教团体也跑进了中国。天主教会的辅仁大学，就是根据一九二三年八月七日，全美本笃会会议所通过的提案成立的（杭州天主堂出版：“圣宗教与中国”）。到一九三○年为止，美国到中国的天主教团体共有九个，他们在广东、福建、浙江、江苏和长江沿岸各地，主要是蒋介石的根据地里边，获得了教区。南京教区主教兼“中华全国公教进行会”总监督于斌，这个美国洋奴，得过意大利法西斯匪帮勋章的法西斯蒂政治学博士，在蒋介石进行十年反人民的内战，依靠美国投降日本帝国主义的时期，就帮着蒋介石匪帮反对中国人民，他的喽ｌｕｏ＠①曾供出：于斌“对于我国复兴运动（法西斯运动），及国防计划（屠杀人民、投降帝国主义），均有伟大的贡献，故委员长及国府要人（蒋匪及其爪牙），均甚器重”。（“于总主教略历”）美国天主教随着美国侵略势力进入中国以后，立刻帮助中国的反革命匪帮残害中国人民，并扩大美国对中国的侵略。美国天主教没有进入中国以前，中国人没有一个当主教的。美国天主教进入中国以后，一九二六年一次就有了六个中国籍的主教，而且以后中国籍的主教继续增加，这可以说是美国“以华制华”政策的又一次表演。这种政策对中国人起了一部分麻痹作用，象于斌之类以中国人替美帝国主义当走狗，起初是会使某些人看不清楚他的真面目的。其次，美国天主教进入中国不久，蒋介石就窃取了政权，蒋介石需要美国各方面的支持，更需要法西斯爵士于斌的协助。再加上法帝国主义本身又衰老下去，于是美国天主教势力在中国能够很快地扩张。
    一九三九年巴赛里当了罗马教皇，“他和罗斯福特别要好。罗斯福曾派遣一个特使驻梵蒂冈跟教皇合作”（“教皇在梵蒂冈”）。从此美国掌握了教皇，中国天主教也几乎全成了美国的势力。美国所掌握的天主教，在抗日战争期间，一直是反苏反共反中国人民。特别在美国准备对日本妥协的时候，这种反动活动尤其嚣张，一九四一年五月“圣心报”五十五期，辱骂苏联是“一脸横肉的俄罗斯人”；污蔑中国共产党是“苏联底支店”；污蔑抗日人民是站在斯大林背后，“会喊口号、会写标语、会唱救亡歌曲的爱国君子”。天主教中的美国奴才，那时就是日寇的走狗。
    抗日战争结束了，于斌在南京创立“天主教文化协进会”，企图在全国一百三十个教区中成立分会，并企图在全国二十五处大都市中出版“益世报”，计划着使全国天主教都成为美国的势力，帮助蒋美压榨中国人民。因此于斌被教皇提升为江苏教区的总主教。一九四七年元旦于斌举行就职典礼时，教廷公使黎培理致词，公然说天主教要辅助蒋介石匪帮的“建国工作”；一月二十一日于斌等自称“东北民众代表团”，请求蒋介石“迅速收复东北各地主权”（“益世周刊”），不仅如此，于斌还是蒋匪的伪国大代表，而且还是伪国大主席团之一。这个美蒋匪帮的重要帮凶，正是人民所要逮捕审判的战犯。
    　　　　中国人民胜利声中美帝在华教会的特务活动
    在人民解放战争中，人民力量空前长大，美蒋在军事上政治上节节失败，于是便加强特务活动，混入解放区来破坏。解放区实行信仰自由的政策，美蒋就依靠一部分恶教士在解放区中实行阴谋破坏。如邢台天主堂散发美国神甫Ｆａｌｔａｎｌ　Ｓｈｅｅｎｄ所编的反共小册子，在小修院中教给儿童唱“反共小调”，利用传教的机会，散布谣言说：“国民党军队不出一个月就来到。”并且隐藏三青团冀南总负责人高连九，在邢台布置特务工作，掩护着高德林等四十三个汉奸逃避人民的逮捕审判，最后又护送他们逃亡石门（当时还未解放）；甚至暗藏枪械六十余枝，企图组织暴动，迎接蒋匪军队侵占邢台；其他如放毒药、打黑枪、给美蒋送情报等罪行、不一而足，直到一九四六年底，恶教士葛乐才等被邢台人民查获以后，反人民的活动才被扑灭。其他如山东、河北、东北各地人民所捕获的匪特中，有许多是恶教士，许多是潜伏在天主堂里。用耶稣的话来说：教堂本是“祷告的殿，你们到使他成为贼窝了”（“马太福音”第二十一章）。随着人民解放战争的胜利，蒋介石匪帮的倒台，美国宗教侵华又转变了新方式，即利用解放区的信仰自由，使特务匪帮借宗教的外衣，破坏人民的政权与人民的一切利益。企图保存反动力量，以便乘机复辟。
    美国宗教侵入中国，他们在中国办了一些报纸和学校，对中国接受资本主义文化一方面有一点推进作用。也正因为有这一点作用，就很容易使人麻痹，忽略了它的侵略实质。戈公振对于帝国主义在中国办报纸说：“外报之目的，为传教与通商而宣传。其言论与纪载，均与其国之外交方策息息相关，一步一趋，丝毫不乱。”（“中国报学史”）日本人对于帝国主义在中国办学校说：“泰西诸国，实行殖民政略，即教育之事，亦其一端也。彼等自殖民之始，即派传教士以布耶稣教，冥冥之中，换其人民之脑筋，使同化于己。今英语之教育权在支那者，实有许多潜势力，以教育为扶植势力之源。”（一九○二年出版之“教育时论”）英国伦敦商会负责人说得更清楚，他说：节省几分钟的广告费，拿给牧师到中国去办学校，不止所训练的学生，甚至连学生的家庭亲友，都会替我们宣传，这比那死广告可是好多了（古梅：“现代中国及其教育”）。美国教士们在中国办报纸、办学校，一是侵害中国主权，一是培植美国势力。现在美帝国主义所寄托希望的，主要就是利用过去它所培养的所谓民主个人主义者，而且今后还企图继续培养这种人。不过中国人，除去极少数的民族败类以外，绝大多数是站在人民方面的，决不会再上美帝国主义的当了。
    以上仅仅是举几个例，美国宗教侵略中国的罪行是说不完的。我们确实主张而且认真执行信教自由的政策，但是帝国主义者通过宗教——基督教也吧，天主教也吧——来侵略中国，反对中国人民，帮助反革命匪帮来破坏中国人民的解放事业，我们是决不能容忍的。“那些伪善地用传布基督教之名以掩护掠夺政策的人，中国人能不憎恶他们吗？”艾奇逊所说的那种美国宗教和中国的“联系”，我们中国人民是憎恶到极点的。美帝国主义派遣来侵略中国的恶教士们，你们走遍海洋陆地，去充满你们祖宗的恶贯吧，你们这些蛇类，毒蛇之种啊，怎能逃脱人民的刑罚呢！
