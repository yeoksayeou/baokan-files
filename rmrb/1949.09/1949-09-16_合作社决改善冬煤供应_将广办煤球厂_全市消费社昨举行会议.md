　　Cooperatives Decide to Improve Winter Coal Supply
　  Coal Briquette Factories Will Be Widely Established
　  Citywide Consumer Cooperative Held Meeting Yesterday
    [This Newspaper's Report] As winter approaches, with wind and snow, coal briquettes become wetter and more expensive. "This is it, take it or leave it!" Almost every long-time resident of Beiping has suffered this. To solve the winter fuel problem and develop street cooperatives from winter production, the Municipal General Cooperative convened a citywide consumer cooperative meeting on the 15th, calling on all street cooperatives to set up coal briquette factories, both to support the production of cooperative members and to supply fuel to all cooperative members in the city. Several production and management methods were proposed at the meeting: First, processing for the General Cooperative, with an exchange ratio of 2,100 jin of coal briquettes for every ton of coal dust received. This method only requires preparing tools and a location, which can save capital. Second, self-management, with the General Cooperative introducing coal purchases from the Coal Company or Chaoyangmen Coal Factory, at 4% cheaper than the daily listed price, and credit for seven days; a 5% discount for cash purchases. Third, self-management and processing for the General Cooperative, producing as much as possible within the limits of tools and location, with no problem with sales. Fourth, buying coal dust yourself and finding private coal briquette factories to process it, but the quality must be guaranteed. If the above methods are still insufficient to meet demand, the General Cooperative and the Coal Company may open large coal briquette factories to make up for the shortfall. In terms of sales: the General Cooperative will announce the price of coal briquettes in the newspaper every day, and each processing cooperative will sell at that price, recording the accounts daily and settling them periodically. Coal delivery is generally limited to the district. Alternatively, the General Cooperative will uniformly purchase coal briquettes from each cooperative and issue coal briquette tickets, and cooperative members can take the tickets to the nearby coal briquette factory to pick up coal. Therefore, the denser and more numerous the distribution of coal briquette factories, the better. At the same time, to strengthen the organization and planning of production and distribution and overcome the "coal briquette parade" of previous years, the General Cooperative has specially formulated a "Survey Form of Member Distribution and Coal Consumption" for each consumer cooperative, to facilitate local distribution and save transportation capacity; and to allow each consumer cooperative that handles coal briquette factories to fill out a production budget form, reporting the half-year production volume, how much is left after supplying their own cooperative members; and to budget the number of tons of raw coal needed for half a year, and submit it to the Coal Company for supply preparation. Currently, more than 20 street cooperatives in the city have begun preparations to set up coal briquette factories, and a few cooperatives have already started production. The future results will depend on the producers' guarantee of quality and their efforts in management. As long as the quality is high and the price is low, the consumer cooperative will not fail to support it.

　　合作社决改善冬煤供应
　  将广办煤球厂
　  全市消费社昨举行会议
    【本报讯】越到冬天刮风下雪的日子，煤球越湿越贵，“就是这个货，爱买不买！”北平的老住户，差不多都吃过这个苦头。为了解决冬季燃料及从冬季生产中发展街道合作社，市总社于十五日召集全市消费合作社会议，号召各街道社开办煤球厂，一则扶植社员生产，二则供应全市社员燃料。在大会上提出了几个生产经营的办法：第一给总社加工，交换比例是收煤末一吨交煤球二千一百斤。这个办法只须准备用具和地址，可以节省资金。第二是自己经营，由总社介绍到煤炭公司或朝阳门煤厂批煤，按每日牌价再便宜百分之四，还可赊帐七天；现款买便宜百分之五。第三是一面自营一面给总社加工，在工具和地址许可下可尽量生产，销路没问题。第四，自己买煤末，找私营煤球厂加工，但必须保证质量好。如采用上述方法之后，仍供不应求时，总社和煤炭公司或将开办大的煤球厂，以供不足。在销售方面：总社每天在报纸上公布煤球牌价，各加工社按价出售，当日记帐定期结算。送煤一般不出区。或由总社统一收购各社煤球发卖煤球票，各社员持票到附近煤球厂取煤。所以煤球厂的分布越密越多越好。同时为了加强生产和分配的组织性和计划性，克服往年“煤球大游行”的状态，总社特制定了各消费社“社员分布及用煤量调查表”，以便进行就近分配，节省运输力；并让各办理煤球厂的消费社填造生产预算表，报告半年生产量，除供本社社员外，尚有多少剩余；并预算半年需用原煤数，交煤炭公司作供应准备。现市内已有二十几个街道社开始进行筹备开办煤球厂，并有少数社已开始生产。将来的成绩如何，则决定于生产者的保证质量和经营上的努力。只要质高价廉，消费社是不会不支持的。
