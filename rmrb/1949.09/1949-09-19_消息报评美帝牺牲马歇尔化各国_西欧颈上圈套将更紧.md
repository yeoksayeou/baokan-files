Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 17th: Moscow dispatch: A commentator on international affairs for the newspaper *Izvestia* recently authored an article commenting on the second year of the Marshall Plan, specifically the US's allocation of "aid" to Marshall Plan countries, stating: The US ruling clique is implementing a policy of longer sticks and fewer carrots, striving to sacrifice Western European Marshall Plan countries in order to stem the impact of the American economic crisis.

For a long time, the so-called "Organization for European Economic Cooperation" (OEEC) Council has been painstakingly considering how to resolve the difficult task of allocating the reduced "aid" appropriations (not yet finally approved by the US Congress) among the Marshall Plan partners. Everything taking place within the Council very well illustrates the current economic situation in Western Europe and the characteristics of US imperialist policy. American imperialism wants to use the reduced "aid" appropriations to Western Europe to seek even greater effects in further enslaving Western European countries to American capital.

The failure of the Marshall Plan and the approaching economic crisis are now acknowledged by the leaders of the Marshall Plan countries. The report drafted by OEEC Council Chairman Spaak and Secretary-General Marjolin regarding the allocation of US "aid" confirms the sharp decline in Western Europe's exports to the dollar area. This means that the United States, affected by the impending crisis, has restricted imports from Western Europe. In June of this year, the value of US exports to Western European Marshall Plan countries reached $406 million, while imports from these countries were only worth $66 million. If this trend continues, Western Europe's dollar deficit in trade with the United States will be approximately $4 billion by the end of the year. As a result, the noose around the necks of Western European countries will be tightened further.

The preliminary allocation of "aid" appropriations to Marshall Plan countries, which has not yet been approved by Congress, indicates that there is no possibility of alleviating Western Europe's dollar crisis. For example, the planned allocations to Britain and France are much less than the dollar amounts requested by the governments of those two countries. The French ruling clique surpasses its counterparts in other Marshall Plan countries in selling out national independence to Wall Street merchants. The French government recently passed laws facilitating the investment of foreign capital in France and its overseas territories. From now on, American monopoly capitalists will fully control the economies of France and its colonial territories. Interestingly, American merchants have simultaneously obtained the same rights in occupied Japan. This shows that the Marshall Plan has reduced France to a position subordinate to the United States, just like Japan is to the MacArthur regime.

### 消息报评美帝牺牲马歇尔化各国　西欧颈上圈套将更紧

　　消息报评美帝牺牲马歇尔化各国
  　西欧颈上圈套将更紧
    【新华社北平十七日电】莫斯科讯：消息报国际问题评论员顷著文评论马歇尔计划实施的第二年美国对马歇尔化各国美“援”的分配称：美国统治集团执行加长棍子、减少胡萝卜的政策，力谋牺牲西欧马歇尔化各国，以抑止美国经济危机的冲击。
    很久以来，所谓“欧洲经合局”理事会一直在煞费心思，以考虑如何解决在马歇尔计划伙伴中分配尚未为美国国会最后通过的削减了的“援助”拨款的这一困难任务。在理事会中进行着的一切，很可以说明目前西欧的经济情势和美帝国主义政策的特点。美帝国主义想借给西欧的缩小了的“援助”拨款，以寻求在进一步使西欧各国受美国资本奴役中获致更大的效果。
    马歇尔计划的失败和经济危机的迫近，刻已为马歇尔化各国的领袖所承认。欧洲经合局理事会主席斯诺瓦及该会秘书长马若林所起草的关于美“援”分配的报告，证实了西欧对美元地区输出的剧减。这意味着美国为迫近中的危机所影响，限制了自西欧的输入，今年六月份，美国对西欧马歇尔化各国的输出品的价值，达四亿零六百万美元，而自这些国家的输入，仅值六千六百万美元。假如按照这一趋势继续下去的话，则西欧与美国贸易的美元赤字在年底前便将约为四十亿美元。其结果，套在西欧各国颈上的圈套将束得更紧。
    尚未为国会所通过的对马歇尔化各国“援助”拨款的初步分配，表示出西欧的美元危机没有任何缓和的可能。例如按计划给予英法的拨款，较该两国政府所要求的美元数额少得多。法国统治集团在出卖国家民族的独立给华尔街商人中，胜过其他马歇尔化国家的同伴。法国政府最近通过了便利外国资本投入法国及其海外领地的法令，从此，美国垄断资本家将充分支配法国和其殖民地领土的经济。有趣的是，美国商人同时在被占领的日本也获得了同样的权利。由此可见，马歇尔计划已把法国降到从属于美国的地位，正象日本之于麦克阿瑟政权一样。
