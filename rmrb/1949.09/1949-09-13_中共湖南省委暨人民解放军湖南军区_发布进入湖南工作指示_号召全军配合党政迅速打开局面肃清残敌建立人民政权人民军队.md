Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 12th: The Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Hunan Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army issued the following instructions on the initial work of the entire army under the military region upon entering Hunan on the 5th of this month:

The southward army has entered Hunan, and northern, central, and eastern Hunan have been liberated. The Hunan Military Region has been established, and the entire province of Hunan will soon be completely liberated. The main force of the field army will continue to advance, but several armies will be left behind from the field army to garrison Hunan. In addition, three more divisions will be transferred and dispersed as the established troops of various military sub-districts in Hunan. Several thousand party, government, military, and civilian cadres will be sent to Hunan, together with several thousand members of the original Hunan underground party and some local armed forces led by the Hunan party that persisted in guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines in the past, to jointly undertake the arduous and glorious task of overthrowing the reactionary rule, establishing a people's democratic government, eliminating reactionary armed forces, and establishing a people's army. The Provincial Party Committee and the Military Region fully believe that with this strong army, a large number of cadres, and the party's original foundation, as long as the entire party and army work together, they will surely victoriously complete the task of building a new Hunan.

Hunan is a strategic base for our continued advance to the southwest. The success of the work in the Hunan area is directly related to the continued advance and the victory of the war. Therefore, the primary task of the entire army under the military region is to closely cooperate with the party and government organs to quickly open up the situation, complete the takeover of urban and rural areas, reorganize various mixed troops, eliminate bandits and remnants of the enemy, stabilize social order, protect cadres going to the countryside to do mass work, launch production and disaster relief, raise grain and grass, repair bridges and roads, smooth traffic, and resolutely complete the work of supporting the front.

In order to better complete the above tasks, we must resolutely implement the Central China Bureau's instructions on the localization of the main force, and emphasize the following points:

　　Localizing the Main Force to Open Up Local Work

(1) We must understand and follow Chairman Mao's and our Party's instructions from the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee that "the People's Liberation Army is both a fighting force and a working force." In particular, all commanders and fighters of the three field divisions assigned to the various military sub-districts must understand that it is glorious to be promoted from a local armed force to a field army. For the needs of winning the national victory and opening up work in new areas, it is equally glorious to transform from a field army to a local army, and from a fighting force to a working force. The history of our People's Liberation Army's construction is often that of developing from a working force to a local army, from a local army to a regular army, and sometimes the regular army is transformed into a working force, or a part is divided to develop and open up local work, and establish new armed forces, and with this law developed to the present composition of millions of troops across the country. Any idea of not wanting to be changed to a local army, not wanting to do local work, not wanting to do mass work, not wanting to carry out bandit suppression and small battles, is contrary to the needs of the development of the revolutionary situation, and is extremely harmful to the completion of the Party's current tasks and the winning of a comprehensive victory. Every comrade who has been assigned to work in Hunan must establish the revolutionary idea of striking roots in Hunan, establishing a career, and working for a long time, and must have the determination to share hardships with the people of Hunan and thoroughly liberate the people of Hunan. Any localism and guerrillaism that disregards the interests of the people and the long-term interests of the revolution must be prevented and overcome in a timely manner. At the same time, it must be understood that the Party wants us to stay in the new area to do arduous pioneering work, and the foundation of all work can only be established through our own efforts; any idea of wanting to sit back and enjoy the fruits of others' labor and waiting is wrong. The "settling down" and hedonistic idea of attempting to go to a good place to "rest for a while," not wanting to go to remote mountainous areas, being reluctant to leave the city, and coveting "living a comfortable life" is an individualistic idea. It will not only cause losses to our current work, but will also lead us to be detached from the masses. We must be vigilant to prevent and overcome the emergence of this degenerate ideology.

　　Understand the Characteristics of Local Work Teams and Work Under the Unified Leadership of the Party Committee

(2) We must correctly understand the locality and decentralization of the characteristics of the work team. The so-called locality means that all actions and military deployments of the army must be coordinated and harmonized with the overall policies and steps of the local party and government work. No department is allowed to act on its own and seek independence from the party. All departments must be centrally unified under the unified leadership of the local party committee, unify thinking and action, unify policies and policies, and unify work steps. In particular, the army must be a model for implementing the party's unified leadership. The so-called decentralization means dispersing to do mass work and dispatching troops with dispersed organization to protect local party and government organs cadres to the countryside to organize mass production and disaster relief, establish political power, raise grain and grass, repair bridges and roads, and support the front lines. It must be recognized that protecting the opening of local party and government work is the army's due task. At the same time, it must be understood that "locality" and "decentralization" are not contradictory to the army's combativeness, but are precisely complementary. In order to establish new armed forces, it is necessary to go through in-depth mass work before it is possible. In order for the mass work to proceed smoothly, it is necessary to eliminate bandits and all reactionary armed forces. To eliminate reactionary armed forces, it is necessary to highly develop the troops' combat enthusiasm. The troops must fight independently and fight battles without detailed orders under the intention of the superior's instructions. As long as there are local reactionary armed forces, they must automatically and actively disintegrate, attack, and eliminate them. Only by eliminating the local reactionary armed forces can the work of mobilizing the masses be truly done well. Only by eliminating the reactionary armed forces can the task of protecting local work be completed. At the same time, it must also be understood that emphasizing locality and decentralization does not negate everything in the past, and does not mean that all the good systems and styles of the past regular army are not applicable. On the contrary, the courageous combat style, the military thinking of annihilation warfare, and the excellent military technology, the high degree of discipline, the strict mass line management and education system, etc. established in the regular army are not only still applicable, but must be adhered to and developed.

　　The Entire Party and Army Unite Closely, Connect with the Masses, and Master Policies

(3) We must recognize the importance of unity of the entire party and army. The troops remaining in Hunan are several troops with different establishments, and the cadres transferred to work in Hunan also come from different regions. Among them, there are bound to be certain differences in living habits and even ideological styles. This requires us to unite better in the party's ideology and policies. For some differences in lifestyle, we should learn from each other's strengths and discard each other's weaknesses, pick up the weapons of criticism and self-criticism, promote advantages, overcome shortcomings, and seek consistency in ideological style. In particular, foreign cadres and foreign troops should unite well with the cadres and troops who persisted in underground work in Hunan and persisted in guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines. We should recognize that the achievements and work experience gained by the comrades of the Hunan underground party and the guerrilla troops organized by our party in years of guerrilla warfare and arduous underground work are the most valuable. It has maintained the party's banner in Hunan, maintained the party's organization and cadres, and enabled the party to maintain and establish good contact with the people of Hunan, and effectively cooperated with the people's revolutionary war. Therefore, when meeting with them or working together, we must help them from all aspects with a kind and enthusiastic attitude, humbly learn from them, and understand the local situation, so as to achieve unity of the entire party and army and further unite the local masses.

(4) Strengthen and improve the political discipline of the troops and the relationship between the army and the people. Our party and our army once had a great reputation and belief in Hunan, and Xianggan was the birthplace of the people's revolution. The broad masses of the people had close ties with our party and our army. Therefore, the people's requirements for our army are high. Naturally, the people will measure everything in our army with the political standards of the Red Army era. If we do not have good political discipline and mass discipline, it will easily cause dissatisfaction among the masses. This strict requirement and supervision of us by the people is completely reasonable and necessary. At the same time, our army is an army led by the Communist Party. All actions of the army represent the policies of the Communist Party, and every move of the army becomes one of the signs for the broad masses to test the Communist Party and the People's Government. The good or bad actions of any small unit will affect the belief of the entire army and the entire party among the masses. Therefore, strengthening the education of the troops' political discipline and strictly enforcing political discipline is one of the focuses of the work of the party committees at all levels.

　　Strengthen the Leadership of the Troops' Mass Work, Carry Out Bandit Suppression and Support the Main Force's Operations

(5) Strengthen the leadership of the troops' mass work, improve the organization of the troops' and all levels of mass work, and mobilize the entire army to do mass work. Leading cadres at all levels must personally be responsible for educating cadres, organizing commanders and fighters to do mass work, making propaganda when seeing people, regularly supervising and inspecting, and strengthening guidance in a timely manner.

(6) At present, in addition to the daily work of allocating cadres, ideological education, and consolidating troops, the central work of the headquarters and political departments (sections) at all levels is to lead and organize the strength of the army, carry out mass work, support the main force's operations, carry out bandit suppression, and reorganize various mixed armed forces. Party committees at all levels must strengthen the leadership of the armed forces, must educate and strengthen the party's ideology of valuing the people's armed forces, boldly lead the localization of the main force, and actively establish new local armed forces. Any phenomenon of abandoning leadership, not daring to lead, not caring for or cherishing the armed forces is wrong and cannot be tolerated. If incorrect tendencies occur in the local armed forces in the future, and they cannot complete the task of opening up work and establishing new local armed forces, the party committee should be responsible, which is a concrete manifestation of the local party not strengthening the leadership of the armed forces and not cherishing the armed forces.

It is hoped that all departments will arrange work according to the actual situation, and take the opportunity to convey, organize discussions in connection with reality, and report the arrangement of work and the situation of conveying and discussing upwards!

　　中共湖南省委暨人民解放军湖南军区
　  发布进入湖南工作指示
    号召全军配合党政迅速打开局面肃清残敌建立人民政权人民军队
    【新华社长沙十二日电】中国共产党湖南省委及中国人民解放军湖南军区，本月五日发布对军区所属全军进入湖南初期工作指示如下：
    南下大军已进入湘境，湘北、湘中、湘东已获解放，湖南军区业已成立，湖南全省即将完全解放。野战军主力要继续向前进，但由野战军中留下几个军镇守湖南，另再抽调三个师，分散作为湖南各军分区的建制部队；并以派遣数千党、政、军及民连干部入湘，与原湖南地下党数千党员及湖南党领导的过去坚持敌后游击战争的若干地方武装，共同担负推翻反动统治，建立人民民主政权，消灭反动武装，建立人民军队的艰巨而光荣的任务。省委与军区完全相信有此强大的军队加上大批的干部及党的原有基础，只要全党全军共同努力，必能胜利地完成建设新湖南的任务。
    湖南是我继续向西南进军的战略基地，湖南地区工作开展的好坏与继续进军及战争的胜利有直接关系。因此军区所属全军之首要任务，就是密切配合党政机关迅速打开局面，完成接管城乡工作，整编各色游杂部队，肃清土匪残敌，安定社会秩序，掩护干部下乡做群众工作，发动生产与救灾，筹集粮草，修桥铺路，顺畅交通，坚决完成支前工作。
    为着很好地完成上述任务，我们必须坚决执行华中局关于主力部队地方化的指示，并着重指出几点如下：
    主力部队地方化开辟地方工作
    （１）必须了解和遵循毛主席及我党二中全会“人民解放军是一个战斗队又是一个工作队”的指示，尤其拨归各军分区建制部队的三个野战师的全体指战员，要了解由地方武装升为野战军是光荣的；为了争取全国胜利的需要，为了开辟新区工作，由野战军转化为地方军，由战斗队转化为工作队，同样是光荣的。我人民解放军的建军史，就常常是由工作队发展成地方军，由地方军发展成正规军，正规军有时又化为工作队，或分一部分发展与开辟地方工作，建立新的武装，随着这个规律发展到现在组成了全国数百万大军。任何不愿改为地方军的思想，不愿做地方工作，不愿做群众工作，不愿进行剿匪打小仗的思想，都是违反革命形势发展的需要，对完成党的当前任务，争取全面胜利是极端有害的。已经被分配到湖南工作的每个同志都要确立在湖南生根立业长期工作的革命思想，都要有与湖南人民同艰苦并彻底解放湖南人民的决心。任何不顾人民群众利益和革命长远利益的本位主义和游击主义，都必须注意防止和及时克服。同时必须了解，党要把我们留在新地区是要做艰苦的开辟工作，一切工作的基础，是要经过自己的努力才能建立起来的；任何想坐享其成及等待的思想都是不对的。那种企图到好地方去“歇一歇”，不愿意到偏僻山区，留恋城市，贪图“过过安乐日子”的“安家”享乐思想，都是个人主义思想。它不仅会使我们当前工作受到损失，而且将使我们脱离群众。必须警惕防止与克服这种蜕化思想的产生。
    了解地方工作队的特点统一在党委领导下工作
    （２）要正确了解工作队特点的地方性与分散性。所谓地方性就是军队的一切行动、军事布署，都要与地方党政工作总的方针步骤相配合、相协调，不允许任何部门各自为政，对党闹独立性。各个部门必须集中统一在当地党委的一元化领导之下，统一思想行动，统一方针政策，统一工作步骤。尤其是军队要成为执行党的领导一元化的榜样。所谓分散性，就是分散做群众工作，分散建制的派遣部队去掩护地方党政机关干部到农村去进行组织群众生产救灾，建立政权，筹借粮草，修桥补路，支援前线。必须认识掩护地方党政开辟工作，是军队的应有任务。同时必须了解“地方性”“分散性”并不与军队的战斗性相矛盾，而是恰恰相配合的。为了要建立新的武装，必须要经过深入的群众工作，才有可能。为着群众工作的顺利进行，必须要消灭土匪和一切反动武装。要消灭反动武装就要高度地发扬部队战斗积极性。部队要独立打仗，要在上级指示的意图下，打没有详细命令的仗。只要那里有地方反动武装就要自动积极地去瓦解它，打击它，消灭它。只有消灭了地方反动武装，才能真正做好发动群众的工作。也只有消灭了反动武装，才能完成掩护地方工作的任务。同时也要了解强调地方性、分散性，并不否定过去的一切，不是说过去正规军一套很好的制度作风都不适用了，恰恰相反，正规军中所建立起来的勇猛的战斗作风，歼灭战的军事思想及优良的军事技术，高度的纪律性，严格的又是群众路线的管理教育制度等等，不仅仍然适用，而且必须将它坚持和发扬起来。
    全党全军紧密团结联系群众掌握政策
    （３）必须认识全党全军团结的重要。留在湖南的部队是几个不同建制的部队，调到湖南工作的干部也是来自不同的地区，其中生活习惯以至思想作风难免有某些差别。这就要求我们要在党的思想上政策上更好地团结起来。对某些生活作风的不同，就应互相学其长，弃其短，拿起批评与自我批评的武器，发扬优点，克服缺点，求得思想作风的走向一致。尤其外来干部及外来军队，要与坚持湖南地下工作及坚持敌后游击战争的干部与部队很好地团结。我们应该认识，湖南地下党的同志及我党组织起来的游击部队，在多年游击战争及地下艰苦工作中获得的成就，及其工作经验是最可宝贵的。它保持本党在湖南的旗帜，保持党的组织和干部，使党与湖南人民保持与建立了很好的联系，有力地配合了人民革命战争。因此与他们会合，或共同工作，均须以亲切热情的态度从各方面帮助他们，要虚心的向他们学习，和了解当地情况，以达到全党全军团结和进一步团结当地群众的目的。
    （４）要加强与提高部队的政治纪律与军民关系。我党我军在湖南曾经有过很大声望与信仰，同时湘赣又是人民革命的策源地，广大人民群众与我党我军是有过密切联系的。因此人民对我军队的要求是高的。很自然的，人民将以红军时代的政治尺度来测量我们军队的一切。假若我们在政治纪律群众纪律上不好，就易引起群众对我们的不满。人民对我们这种严格要求与督促是完全合理与必要的。同时我们的军队是共产党领导的军队。军队的一切行动都代表着共产党的政策，军队的一举一动都成为广大群众测验共产党和人民政府的标志之一。任何一个小部队的行动的好或坏，都将影响全军全党在群众中的信仰。因此加强部队政治纪律的教育与严格执行政治纪律，是各级党委领导工作的重心之一。
    加强部队民运工作领导进行剿匪支援主力作战
    （５）加强部队民运工作领导，健全部队及各级民运工作的组织，动员组织全军做民运工作。各级领导干部要亲自负责去教育干部，组织指战员人人做群众工作，见人做宣传，经常督促检查并及时加强指导。
    （６）目前各级司令部政治部（处）的工作，除了调配干部思想教育巩固部队等日常工作外，当前的中心工作就是领导与组织军队的力量，进行民运工作，进行支援主力作战，进行剿匪，改编各色游杂武装。各级党委必须加强对武装的领导，必须教育与加强党内的重视人民武装的思想，大胆领导主力部队地方化，积极建立新的地方武装，任何放弃领导，不敢领导，不关心不爱护武装的现象，均是错误的和不能容许的。地方武装今后如发生不正确倾向，不能完成开辟工作与建立新的地方武装任务时，党委均应负责，均是地方党未加强对武装领导，不爱护武装的具体表现。
    以上各点望各部根据实际情况布置工作，并利用时机进行传达，联系实际组织讨论，并将工作的布置及传达讨论的情形向上报告！
