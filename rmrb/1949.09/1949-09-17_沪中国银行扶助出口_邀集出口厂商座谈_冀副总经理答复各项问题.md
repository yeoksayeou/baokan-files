　　Shanghai Bank of China Supports Exports
　　Invites Export Manufacturers to Symposium
　　Deputy General Manager Ji Answers Various Questions
　　[Shanghai News] Since the Bank of China announced five loan methods to support export trade, including fixed-amount regular overdrafts and short-term loans, real-value loans, order loans, domestic and foreign port-to-port drafts, and export material packing loans, in order to further understand the current situation of manufacturers who are exporting, so as to provide specific and effective assistance, it specially invited more than 20 exporters of straw hats, lace, menthol, feathers, and light industrial products in the city to hold a symposium on the 7th of this month. The topics discussed included the current actual situation of various export industries, market prices, foreign prices, inventory, transportation conditions, sales channels, current business plans, and urgent problems to be solved. In addition to reporting the current actual situation, the exporters also raised specific questions about foreign exchange rates, capital turnover, terms, draft collateral, etc. Finally, Deputy General Manager Ji and Manager Xiang summarized the answers: (1) The Bank of China is a foreign exchange professional bank, and it will do its best to develop production and support exports. (2) The setting of the foreign exchange rate is freely negotiated by the buyer and seller on the principle of encouraging exports, but now it is in a temporary special situation, with more sellers and fewer buyers. In the future, it will naturally tend to a reasonable level as import and export trade recovers. (3) Regarding the capital problem, our bank is willing to do its best to help. As for the use of draft or loan methods, it can be considered. We hope that various industries will have specific business plans to negotiate with our bank individually at any time. (4) The seasonality of export goods should be noted. Under the current circumstances, part of our funds has been used by the National Foreign Trade Corporation to purchase native products. As for the acquisition by various industries themselves, if it does not belong to the past hoarding of export materials but is a genuine capital flow, the bank's assistance within the scope of its business is possible. The bank is actively trying to solve all the difficulties in the allocation of remittances in the distribution centers of export goods.
　　All the exporters expressed satisfaction with the Bank of China's down-to-earth attitude in supporting the export business, and they were willing to actively find ways to overcome the current difficulties and increase exports with the help of the bank.

　　沪中国银行扶助出口
  　邀集出口厂商座谈
  　冀副总经理答复各项问题
    【上海讯】中国银行自公布扶助出口贸易实施定额定期透支及短期贷款、折实贷款、订货贷款、内外销埠际押汇、出口物资打包放款等五种贷款办法后，为进一步了解目前正在出口之厂商现状，以便具体而有效的扶助起见，特于本月七日邀集本市出口商举行座谈会，出席者计有草帽、花边、薄荷脑、羽毛及轻工业品等出口商二十余人，座谈问题包括各出口业目前实际情况、市价、国外价格、存量、运输情形、销路及目前业务计划和急待解决的问题等，各出口商除报告目前实际情况外，并提出有关外汇汇率、资金周转、期限、汇水担保品等具体问题，最后由冀副总经理、项经理总结答复：（一）中国银行是外汇专业银行，对于发展生产扶助出口，当尽力为之。（二）外汇率的订定，是在鼓励出口原则上，由买卖双方自由议定的，但现在是处于暂时特殊的情况，卖出者多而买进者少，将来自当随进出口贸易之恢复而趋于合理之水准。（三）关于资金问题本行愿尽力帮助，至于用押汇或押款等方式，都可考虑，希望各业有具体的业务计划随时与本行个别商谈。（四）出口货中的季节性问题是应注意的，在目前情况下，我们的资金已有一部分通过国外贸易总公司来收购土产，至于各业本身的收购，如果不属于象过去囤积出口物资而是真正资金流转性质，要求银行方面在业务范围内的协助，是可以的。在出口货物的集散地，所有调拨汇兑的困难，本行正积极设法解决中。
    各出口商对于中国银行扶助出口事业的实事求是的态度，一致表示满意，咸愿在银行帮助下，自己积极设法克服目前的困难，多多增加出口。
