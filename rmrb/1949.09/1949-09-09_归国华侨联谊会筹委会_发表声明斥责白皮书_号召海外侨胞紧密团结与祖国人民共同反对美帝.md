The Preparatory Committee of the Returned Overseas Chinese Federation issued the following statement regarding the American White Paper:

First, the White Paper makes us realize that the American imperialists are the most shameless liars. In the White Paper, it first pretends to be hypocritical, saying, "The United States has long had extremely friendly ties with this great country (referring to China)." This statement by the American imperialists is a vague and confusing statement, a shameless attempt to steal the American people's friendship with the Chinese people to cover up its consistent brutal face of oppression and persecution of the Chinese people, in order to carry out enslavement and exploitation again. We are very clear that there has indeed long been an extremely close and precious friendly relationship between the American and Chinese peoples, while the American imperialists have always had only hatred towards the Chinese people. As is well known, overseas Chinese everywhere suffer from imperialist persecution. Especially the overseas Chinese who have resided in the United States will never forget the barbaric provincial defense army of the American Empire in the last century, which, under the pretext of epidemic prevention, carried out a massacre in San Francisco by blockading and surrounding Chinatown. They will also not forget the Chinese Exclusion Act specially formulated by the American Empire for a century to restrict the entry of Chinese, they will not forget the ungrateful and robbery behavior of the American Empire in expelling hundreds of thousands of Chinese workers after they completed the construction of railways and the opening of gold mines in the American West. They have deep and indelible impressions of the suffering of being innocent and imprisoned upon initial entry (Angel Island), the lack of freedom of residence upon entry, and social discrimination. They will not forget the pain and deep hatred suffered under the persecution of the reactionary running dogs of the Dutch East Indies and the Philippines, in Indonesia, the Philippines, and China, instigated by the American Empire.

Secondly, the White Paper cannot but admit that we Chinese people, united together, have an irresistible power of unity. It cannot but admit that the failure of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit army this time is not due to any external force but due to the "internal forces" of the Chinese people. Because of this lesson that "unity is strength," we overseas Chinese must work even harder to unite and further expand the scope of unity. We must abandon the sectarian concepts, gang styles, localism, individualism that disregards the interests of the masses, and supra-class thinking that ignores politics that existed in the past. From now on, we must strive to unite every patriotic and democratic person with different beliefs and classes in the local area, and unite with the local people to become a force to resist imperialist aggression. We are firmly confident and will redouble our vigilance so as not to fall into the tricks and conspiracies of the American Empire's division, so that the so-called "democratic individualism" fifth column cannot play a role in the overseas Chinese community and the democratic camp, and so that the American Empire will suffer another crushing defeat.

美帝挑拨中苏友谊我们却要亲密合作
The American Empire Sows Discord Between China and the Soviet Union, But We Must Cooperate Closely

Furthermore, Acheson, in his statement, very "frankly" tells us that the American Empire will continue to implement various different ways of invading China in the future. Its methods may shift from open intervention to secret sabotage; it may come from the outside or it may be divisive from the inside; it may range from naval blockade to land encirclement, and even harassment of our border regions; it may even use various methods simultaneously. Just like the conspiracies and tricks that the imperialists implemented in an attempt to eliminate the Soviet Union after the October Revolution. But before implementing various forms of aggression, the American Empire must first isolate the Chinese people so that they cannot obtain foreign friendly countries and the sympathy and assistance of the people of the world. It first alienates the friendship between China and the Soviet Union, and secondly provokes the feelings between China and its Southeast Asian neighbors.

Acheson's letter to Truman contains an even more vicious conspiracy, that is, to bluntly make the assumption that China "attempts to invade China's neighbors" and "threatens the situation of international peace and security." The conclusion is that the American Empire must "encounter a principle that violates the United Nations Charter with other member states of the United Nations." The intention of this statement is very clear: firstly, the American Empire can at any time falsely accuse us of attempting to invade neighboring countries, under the pretext of threatening international peace and security, to carry out an action that violates the Charter in conjunction with other member states, and launch a war of aggression to interfere in the Chinese people. Secondly, the American Empire expresses special concern to China's neighbors such as Siam, Vietnam, South Korea, and the Philippines regarding China's aggression against them, alienating the friendship between overseas Chinese and the local people, dispersing their unity, and then using the method of defeating them one by one to colonize these Chinese neighbors. We overseas Chinese must fully expose the American Empire's vicious policy of dividing the oppressed nations, and explain that the American Empire will definitely use the method of supporting counter-revolutionary forces that it used to attack the Chinese people in the past to attack China's neighbors. We overseas Chinese must always express a sincere attitude of friendship, sympathy, mutual assistance, and cooperation to the people of the area where we are located, and must show that we are patriots and also internationalists. We overseas Chinese will not become arrogant towards the people of other countries because of the victory of the motherland's revolution, and we will not have the Han chauvinistic thinking of Yelang's arrogance. Since the Chinese people oppose the imperialists' aggression, oppression, and exploitation, they will never turn themselves into aggressors, oppressors, and exploiters. The oppressed nations and exploited people of the world will definitely understand the Chinese people's position even more, and will inevitably become closer to us because of the American Empire's provocation and alienation. The American Empire's attempt to divide the Chinese people and China's neighbors is doomed to failure.

Finally, we overseas Chinese solemnly declare to the American Empire that no matter when and where, the Chinese people resolutely support the united government of the people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class (through the Communist Party of China) and based on the worker-peasant alliance to the end. The people's government that you dislike is the one we love the most. The reactionary governments of Chiang Kai-shek and Li Zongren, which you like, are the ones we Chinese people hate the most. Because the interests of you American imperialists and the interests of the Chinese people are irreconcilable and stand in diametrical opposition. You American Empire are our real enemy.

Therefore, we overseas Chinese are even more convinced that only under the strong democratic government led by the CCP and united by various democratic parties can the interests of our returned overseas Chinese be legally guaranteed like the domestic people; the status of our overseas Chinese will be able to obtain equal treatment in the countries where they are located, just like the people of other countries.

We firmly and unswervingly believe that the power of the Chinese people and the unity of the peaceful forces of the people of the world, headed by the Soviet Union, will surely defeat the aggressive forces of imperialism, headed by the American Empire.

Chairman Mao once had two famous sayings: If Chiang Kai-shek launches a civil war, the Chinese revolution will succeed faster; if Truman launches a third world war, the world revolution will also succeed faster. Chairman Mao's first famous saying has already been fulfilled today. His latter famous saying will also receive the same fulfillment. If the American Empire dares to take the risk.

　　归国华侨联谊会筹委会
  　发表声明斥责白皮书
    号召海外侨胞紧密团结与祖国人民共同反对美帝
    【本报讯】归国华侨联谊会筹委会，对美国白皮书发表声明如下：
    首先，白皮书使我们认清美帝国主义者是最无耻的说谎者。它在白皮书中首先就装着伪善的口吻说道：“对于这个大国（指中国），美国早就有着极密友谊的联系。”美帝这种说法是笼统的鱼目混珠的说法，是无耻地企图窃取美国人民对中国人民的友谊来掩饰它一贯对中国人民摧残迫害的凶恶脸，以便再来进行奴役榨取的说法。我们认识得很清楚：美国人民和中国人民之间的确早就有着极密的珍贵的友谊联系，而美帝国主义者与中国人民则是一贯只有仇恨。如所周知，在海外华侨到处遭受帝国主义的迫害。尤其是在美国居留过的华侨，永远不能忘却前世纪美帝的野蛮省防军队借口防疫在三藩市用封锁包围唐人街的大屠杀。他们也不会忘却百年来美帝为限制华人入境而特别制定的排华法案，他们不会忘却数十万中国工人在美西完成筑铁路开金矿劳役之后惨被美帝驱逐出境的忘恩负义的强盗行为。他们对于初入境时的无辜被拘入狱（天使岛）的苦况和入境的居住不自由、社会的歧视均有深刻不可磨灭的印象。他们更不会忘记在印尼、在菲律滨、在中国、在美帝指使的荷印菲中的反动走狗的迫害下所遭受的流离颠沛，屠杀死亡的惨痛与深仇大恨。
    其次白皮书不能不承认我们中国人民联合起来有不可抗拒的团结力量。不能不承认这回蒋匪军的失败，不是由于什么外来力量而是由于中国人民的“内部势力”，由于这一“团结就是力量”的教训，我们华侨今后必须更加努力团结，更加扩大团结范围。我们必须放弃过去存在的宗派观念，帮口作风，地方主义，不顾大众利益的个人主义，以及不管政治的超阶级思想。今后更要争取当地每一个信仰、阶级不同的爱国民主人士团结起来，并团结所在地人民，成为抵御帝国主义侵略的力量。我们坚决自信与加倍提高警惕，不要中了美帝分化的诡计阴谋，使得所谓“民主的个人主义”第五纵队，在华侨社会中，民主阵营中起不了作用，而要使美帝再来一次的惨败。
    美帝挑拨中苏友谊我们却要亲密合作
    再次艾奇逊在其声明中，很“坦白地”告诉我们，今后美帝仍然继续施行各种不同方式的侵略中国政策。它的方式可能是由公开干涉的转而从秘密破坏；可能是从外面来也可能是在内部分化的；可能从海洋封锁而至陆上包围，甚至侵扰我国的边疆；也可能同时并用各种方式。正如帝国主义者们企图消灭十月革命后的苏联所施行的阴谋鬼计一样。但是在各种侵略方式实行之前，美帝首先要孤立中国人民，使其得不了外来的友谊国家及世界人民的同情与援助。她首先离间中苏的友谊，其次挑拨中国与东南亚邻邦的感情。
    艾奇逊致杜鲁门信中更有一种毒辣阴谋，即是生硬地作出中国“企图侵略中国的邻邦”“威胁国际和平与安全局面”的假设。结论就是美帝要“和联合国其他会员国必遭遇一种违反联合国宪章的原则”，这声明的用意是很明白的，第一美帝随时可以诬赖我们有侵略邻邦的企图，借口威胁国际和平与安全，来进行一种联合其他会员国家的违反宪章的行动，发动干涉中国人民的侵略战争。其次美帝对于中国邻邦如暹罗、越南、南韩、菲律宾表示着特别关心中国对他们的侵略，离间了海外华侨与当地人民的友谊，分散了他们的团结力，然后用各个击破次第消灭的方法来殖民地化这些中国的邻邦。我们华侨必要尽情揭露美帝这种分化各被压迫民族的阴毒政策，并说明美帝必会用过去进攻中国人民的扶植反革命势力的方法来进攻中国邻邦。我们侨胞必须经常对于所在地的人民表示友谊，同情、互助、合作的诚恳态度，必须表明我们是爱国主义者，同时也是国际主义者。我们华侨不会因祖国革命胜利而对他国的人民骄傲起来，我们不会有夜郎自大的大汉族思想。中国人民既然反对帝国主义者的侵略、压迫与剥削，断不会把自己变成侵略者、压迫者与剥削者。世界被压迫的民族被剥削的人民，必然更会明了中国人民的立场，必然更因美帝的挑拨离间而更加与我们亲密合作。美帝的分化中国人民与中国邻邦，必然是注定失败。
    最后，我们华侨正告美帝，不论何时何地中国人民是坚决拥护工人阶级（经过中国共产党）领导的以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政的联合政府到底。你们所不喜欢的人民政府就是我们所最爱戴的。你们所喜欢的蒋介石、李宗仁的反动政府，我们中国人民是最痛恨的。因为你们美帝的利益与中国人民的利益是不可调和的誓不两立的。你们美帝才是我们真正的敌人。
    因此，我们华侨更相信只有在强有力的中共为首的各民主党派联合的民主政府底下，我们归国的华侨的利益才会得到法律的保障如同国内人民一样；我们在海外的华侨的地位才会取得所在国家的平等待遇如同其他各国人民一样。
    我们坚定不移地相信中国人民力量与以苏联为首的全世界人民和平力量团结起来，必能战胜以美帝为首的帝国主义的侵略势力。
    毛主席曾有两句名言：蒋介石如果发动内战，中国革命就愈快成功；杜鲁门如果发动第三次世界大战，世界革命也就更快成功。毛主席的第一句名言今日已应验了。他的后一句名言也将会得到同样的应验。如果美帝敢于冒险的话。
