　　The North China People's Government Concerned with the Suffering of Disaster Victims
  　Launches "One or Two Rice Grains" Disaster Relief Campaign
    Affiliated Departments Establish Committees to Implement Frugal Disaster Relief
    [Reported by this newspaper] This year, the provinces of North China have successively suffered from varying degrees of drought, pests, wind, floods, hail, and frost disasters, among which the floods in Hebei are particularly severe. It is estimated that there are more than eight million disaster victims in the entire North China region, of whom about 3.5 million are in extreme difficulty due to lack of food and clothing. The North China People's Government is paying serious attention to this issue, leading the people to fight against the disasters, continuously overcome difficulties, and is still actively carrying out various disaster relief measures, such as organizing sideline production and seeking immigration and land reclamation, in order to enable the disaster victims to overcome their difficulties as soon as possible and be properly resettled. Now that the weather is gradually getting colder, how the affected farmers can survive the most difficult winter and spring is a more pressing problem to be solved.
    The North China People's Government has recently called on all its staff to carry out a "one or two rice grains per person per day" frugal disaster relief campaign for a period of six months. This matter was discussed and decided at the joint office meeting of the North China People's Government on the 13th of this month, pointing out that frugal disaster relief is an urgent task that is related to the lives and production of millions of disaster victims. Every government worker who serves the people should care about the suffering of the masses, highly develop the spirit of loving the people, and contribute their own strength to provide cordial help and relief to the affected farmers. In frugal disaster relief, we must continue to implement the opposition to waste, so that more strength can be used for disaster relief and production for the masses. All departments and directly affiliated units should immediately conduct in-depth mobilization, educate everyone, and launch a frugal disaster relief campaign.
    The main points of the decision issued by the North China People's Government to its affiliated departments on launching a frugal disaster relief campaign are as follows: 1. Each department and directly affiliated unit shall establish a committee for frugal disaster relief within the organization, which, in addition to taking charge of the "one or two rice grains" disaster relief campaign, shall also lead and inspect the frugal and anti-waste campaign within the organization. 2. The "one or two rice grains" disaster relief campaign will run from September of this year to February of next year. This campaign will be conducted on a voluntary basis, and all staff members (regardless of the supply system or salary system) can participate in the campaign; and can voluntarily donate according to their own strength. Attention should be paid to persistence, and donations should be made once a month. 3. The list of people participating in the disaster relief campaign and the number of donations from each department and directly affiliated unit shall be submitted to the supply or accounting department of each unit in a table. The total number of people and the amount of grain and money shall be reported to the Finance Department of the North China People's Government for monthly deduction. Salary-based units should also summarize and submit the information to the Finance Department. All disaster relief grain and money should be paid in full at the beginning of each month and remitted to the disaster area in a timely manner. 4. Simultaneously with the "one or two rice grains" disaster relief campaign, all departments and directly affiliated units should launch an in-depth frugal and anti-waste campaign, and continue to implement the main points stipulated in the streamlining and frugality called for by the North China People's Government in May. 5. Extensive publicity should be given to the frugal disaster relief campaign, and each unit should organize reports immediately.
    Currently, all departments and directly affiliated units of the North China People's Government are enthusiastically responding to the call and are actively mobilizing.

    华北人民政府对所属发出开展节约救灾运动决定的要点如下：一、各部门各直属单位均分别成立机关节约救灾委员会，除掌握一两米的救灾运动外，并领导与检查机关节约与反浪费的运动。二、一两米救灾运动自本年九月起至明年二月止。这个运动采取自愿方式，全体工作人员（不分供给制、薪给制）都可参加到运动中来；并可根据各自力量，自愿捐输。要注意持久，每月交纳一次。三、各部门各直属单位参加救灾运动之人名单及捐输数字，应列具表册送交各该单位之供给或会计部门。另将总人数与粮款数报由华北人民政府财政部逐月扣除。薪给制单位亦应汇总交财政部。所有救灾粮款应于每月月初交纳完毕，及时汇转灾区。四、与一两米救灾运动同时，各部门各直属单位应深入展开节约反浪费运动，依照华北人民政府五月中所号召精简节约所规定之要点，继续贯彻。五、对节约救灾运动要做广泛宣传，各单位应即时组织报导。
