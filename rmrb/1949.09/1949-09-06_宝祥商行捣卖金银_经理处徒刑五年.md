　　Baoxiang Trading Company Smuggles Gold and Silver
   　Manager Sentenced to Five Years
    [This City News] Baoxiang Entrusted Trading Company, located in Bamiantang in this city, had only been open for a short time in early June when it began secretly trading in gold and silver. Manager Guo Tingdong was in overall charge, with Deputy Managers Zhang Jinwang and Shao Zuyu assisting in the operation and introducing buyers and sellers. Kang Wenhai was responsible for the accounts of gold and silver transactions. Upon receiving a report, the Gold Management Section of the People's Bank sent cadres from the Gold Management Section, along with officers from the Third Precinct of the First Internal Affairs Division of the Public Security Bureau, to the company on June 17th to investigate. While there, they received continuous phone calls inquiring about gold prices and requesting gold transactions. The comrades from the Gold Management Section and the police station immediately conducted an inspection, seizing over seven liang of various gold scraps, fourteen silver dollars, fourteen touchstones, and various items such as gold-cutting knives and small scales on the spot. During the inspection, a salesman from a Shanghai company, Yu Lianhai, arrived with 50,000 yuan at the behest of Lü Qiyong to purchase ninety silver dollars. Shortly thereafter, Chen Jintai, a worker from the Postal Remittance Bureau, brought a gold ingot to the company for sale, and both were apprehended. During the interrogation, the company's manager, Guo Tingdong, returned from outside on his bicycle. Comrades from the Gold Management Section stepped forward to inquire and discovered recent gold and silver transaction records and several pieces of gold jewelry purchased that day on his bicycle. The Gold Management Section has submitted this case to the People's Court of Beiping Municipality for handling. After interrogation by the court, Guo Tingdong and others confessed to illegally engaging in gold and silver transactions. The court has recently sentenced Guo Tingdong, who used Baoxiang Entrusted Trading Company as a cover for organized private smuggling of gold and silver, to five years in prison. Kang Wenhai, the company's accountant specializing in gold and silver transactions, was sentenced to two and a half years in prison. Zhang Jinwang was sentenced to one and a half years in prison. Shao Zuyu was sentenced to one year in prison. Yu Lianhai's 50,000 yuan in People's Currency, used to privately purchase silver dollars for others, was confiscated, and the perpetrator was released after education. Chen Jintai's gold ingot, intended for private sale on behalf of others, was confiscated, and the perpetrator was released after education. Li Shaozeng, suspected of instigating Guo Tingdong to flee, was released after education. All gold, silver, accounts, and other evidence seized at the company were confiscated.
