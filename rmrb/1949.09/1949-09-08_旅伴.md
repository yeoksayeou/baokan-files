　　Traveling Companions
    By Soviet writer Panova, translated by Su Ling, proofread by Cao Jinghua
    Part One: Night
    Chapter Three: Doctor Billov
    In order to avoid being seen as strange, he was as polite as possible, offering everyone cigarettes and expressing his gratitude in every way.

    Others take on the airs of masters in life. But he stands at the door of life like an uninvited guest, why?

    He doesn't understand why.

    Moreover, he tries his best not to think about it. He feels better this way. He has everything he should. A secure profession, a stable position, a flawless reputation, these are the lovely little tricks that decorate life. What more does one need to be happy?

    From the first day of the war, everything went wrong. Belief, peace, stability—all vanished without a trace. People are used to listening to the sounds of life, like listening to music, even if it's through a wall; but suddenly, it resounds thunderously in their ears.

    He was drafted. Sorry! His physical condition isn't healthy! What then, he will serve on a hospital train. But he is not a surgeon! He can't clamp bullets or apply plaster!… All this is done by others; he will escort the wounded soldiers, take care of them on the road, prevent them from getting sick, and help them recover. Don't worry—if necessary, someone will even teach him how to clamp bullets!

    But he doesn't want to be crippled! He's afraid of bombs! Afraid of suffering!

    "Suprunov, you go to war, it doesn't matter; you should go to war," his mother said softly as she packed his bags. Her head was shaking. He didn't tell her he was afraid. He hated her these days. He hated everyone. Why do they all pretend not to be afraid!? They all know about mines, dumdums, mustard gas, and the cruelty of the enemy just like him. How dare they pretend not to be afraid!?… How dare they smile, talk about daily trivialities, eat ice cream, and go to the theater when their hearts are roaring!

    But everyone seemed to have agreed to pretend. They pretend so well that he doesn't even believe it's pretense, as if they really aren't afraid. He has to pretend too. So he forced people to smoke, talked about trivial things, and tried not to let himself give himself away. He couldn't sleep at night. The train was heading to the front. He smoked, and his hair turned white. Doctor Billov talked to him about stories from his work. Pena flirted with him. Electrical technician Nevitsky came to consult the doctor. Suprunov answered them all politely, but his heart was roaring madly.

    The quartermaster, Subao, became suspicious: Should he report the real situation on the train to the commander, or should he wait for time to wash him, Subao, clean, and for Danilov to issue the rations?

    As for the fact that the personnel on the ambulance only drank millet porridge and soup without a drop of oil, that wasn't Subao's fault. This was what Danilov had ordered. He told Subao:

    "Listen. Forget about the meat, butter, cocoa, and other good things you have on your train."

    "Forget forever?" Subao asked. "Or can I think about these things sometimes?"

    "I'll tell you when you should think about them," Danilov promised him.

    On the fourth day after Billov got on the train, he said embarrassedly to Danilov:

    "You know, our food is not being handled very well. Everyone is dissatisfied. Our quartermaster should put in a little effort."

    "The quartermaster is doing the right thing," Danilov replied. "We don't know what situation we will be in in the near future, where we will receive supplies, what supplies we will receive, and how much we will receive. But we have to feed the wounded soldiers."

    He fiddled with his polished boot tips and concluded:

    "I think Subao is very right."

    "Yes, yes," the doctor said hastily, thinking that Danilov might see him as a selfish glutton, and he blushed. "Right, indeed, we don't know where we can get supplies and what supplies we can get, Subao is right…"

    Everyone was cursing Subao, from the housekeeping nurse who weighed millet for him every morning to Kratov, all were cursing Subao. Kratov didn't explain this in person, but he asked Koritzen to convey that if Subao didn't change this rogue behavior, he would slap him.

    第一部　夜
    第三章　比洛夫医生
    为了不使人见怪起见，他尽可能的客气，请大家抽烟，处处都表示着感谢的样子。
    旁人在人生中摆起主人的架子。而他却象不速之客似的，站在人生的门口，为什么呢？
    他不明白为什么。
    况且，他尽力的不去想它。这样他也觉得好了。他应有尽有呢。牢靠的职业，稳固的地位，白璧无瑕的声誉，这些可爱的小把戏，点缀着人生。究竟还需要些什么才算幸福呢？
    从战争第一天起，一切都全糟了。信念，安宁，稳固——全都消逝得无影无踪了。人惯于听生活的音调，就象听音乐似的，就那还是隔着墙听的；可是，突然间，它在耳边惊天动地的响起来了。
    把他征调了。对不起！他体格不健康呵！怎么呢，他将到救护列车上服务的。可是他不是外科医生呵！他不会钳子弹，也不会敷石膏呵！……这全是别人作的事；他将护送着伤兵，在路上照看着他们，不使生病，叫恢复健康就是了。别叫他担心吧——必要时，连钳子弹都有人会教他呢！
    可是他不愿叫把他弄残废了！他怕炸弹！怕受痛苦！
    “苏普鲁戈夫，你去打仗吧，没关系；应当去打仗呢，”母亲替他收拾着行装，低声说着。她头在抖擞着。他没有告诉她说自己害怕。这几天他恨她。他恨一切人。为什么他们都装着不怕呢！？他们全同他一样的知道地雷，达姆弹，芥子毒气以及敌人的残忍。他们怎会敢假装不怕呢！？……他们心里在咆哮的时候，他们怎敢笑着，谈着日常琐事，吃冰淇淋，去看戏呢！
    可是大家都仿佛商量妥来装模做样似的。他们装得多么妙，他甚至都不相信是装的，好象他们真不怕似的。他也只得去装了。于是他强让人抽烟，谈些琐事，尽力不叫自己露出马脚来。他晚上睡不着觉。火车往前线开着。他抽着烟，头发发白了。比洛夫医生对他谈着自己工作中的故事。裴娜向他撒着娇。电气技师尼威茨基来请教着医生。苏普鲁戈夫客客气气的对他们回答着一切，可是心里疯狂得不断的咆哮着。
    军需官苏葆惑疑起来：把列车上的真实情形全报告给司令呢，还是留待时间去替他，替苏葆洗刷，以及把达尼洛夫汗发出来呢？
    至于说救护车上的人员，尽喝黍子粥和一点油水都没有的汤，那这并不是苏葆的错。这是达尼洛夫这样吩咐的。他告诉苏葆说：
    “你听着吧。你那儿车上有肉，黄油，可可和别的好吃的东西——把这些都忘掉吧。”
    “永远忘掉吗？”苏葆问着。“或者有时可以想起这些吗？”
    “到应该想起的时候，我会告诉你的，”达尼洛夫答应着他。
    比洛夫到了车上第四天，就难为情的对达尼洛夫说：
    “你知道，我们的伙食有点办得不妥当。大家都不满意。应该叫咱们的军需官起一点劲。”
    “军需官作得很对，”达尼洛夫回答着。“我们不知道最近的将来，我们会处到什么情况里，在那儿领到给养，领什么给养，以及领多少，我们全不知道。可是我们得养伤兵呢。”
    他玩弄着擦亮的靴尖，结束着说：
    “我认为苏葆是很对的。”
    “是的，是的，”医生匆匆的说着，他心里想着也许达尼洛夫会把他当成一个自私自利的好吃的人，他面红耳赤起来了。“对的，的确的，我们在那儿能领到给养，以及领些什么给养，都不晓得呢，苏葆是对的……”
    大家全都在骂着苏葆，从每天早晨苏葆给她称黍子的那位庶务护士起，一直到克拉错夫止，全都在骂着苏葆。克拉错夫并没亲自去解释这件事，可是，他托柯里岑转达说，如果苏葆不改这种流氓作风，他就叫他吃耳光呢。
