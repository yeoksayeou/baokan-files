Ping City Briefs

　　In August, pig and chicken plague and livestock anthrax were discovered in Mentougou, Wenquancun, Mayu Village, Wuli Village, Sanjiadian and other areas in the suburbs of this city, and the spread was very serious. After the North China Veterinary Epidemic Prevention Team and the veterinarians and epidemic prevention personnel of the Municipal People's Government Health Bureau went to conduct mobile medical treatment and disinfection, the mortality rate of livestock was reduced on the one hand, and the farmers' awareness of livestock epidemic prevention was improved on the other hand. A total of 94 pigs, 258 chickens, 12 horses, 277 donkeys, and 31 mules were preventatively injected and treated.
　　More than 1,000 faculty members and students of the First Detachment of the North China Military and Political University recently assisted the Railway Bureau in renovating railway work in Changxindian. Work began at 7:00 a.m. that day. Thanks to everyone's joint efforts, the roadbed of the four or five railway tracks at Changxindian Station, one kilometer long from north to south, which had not been repaired for many years, was paved with stones in five hours.
