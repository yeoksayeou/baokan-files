Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 12th:

　　Feng Wenbin, Secretary of the Youth Work Committee of the CPC Central Committee, delivered a report on the work of the Youth League at the East China Youth Work Conference.
　　He first, based on the current situation in the country and East China, put forward the current task of the youth movement in East China: to mobilize and organize the broad masses of young people to overcome difficulties and smash the enemy's blockade. The establishment and development of the Youth League organization is the central link in mobilizing and uniting the broad masses of young people.
　　Secondly, he pointed out that since the Youth League Congress, youth work in various places has achieved great results. At present, the number of Youth League members nationwide is about 500,000, an increase of one and a half times compared to 190,000 four months ago. However, in the establishment of the League in various places, there is still a fairly common, or more or less, tendency towards closed-doorism that is divorced from the masses. This tendency must be guarded against and corrected. We should follow the mass line, build the League to unite and educate the younger generation of young people, and should not be divorced from the masses, divorced from reality, and build the League for the sake of building the League. Regarding this issue, he put forward eight points to explain:
　　First, the purpose of building the League is to meet the demands of progressive youth, and more importantly, to unite and educate the entire younger generation of young people through this advanced, mass-based core organization, including intermediate and backward masses, around the Youth League. This is the only standard for measuring whether the work of the Youth League is correct, and it is also a fundamental issue related to the success or failure of the Youth League.
　　Second, the Youth League should open its doors to the broad masses of progressive youth. It must maintain its advanced nature and have broad mass character, and oppose the practice of setting the conditions for joining the League too high and the procedures too complicated, resulting in many excellent young people being shut out of the League. The organization of the League should break out of the narrow circle and establish and strengthen the foundation for contact with the broad masses of young people. The standards for League members should not include any conditions outside of the League Constitution that are inconsistent with the principles and spirit of the League Constitution. Anyone who is ideologically progressive and actively participates in various New Democratic undertakings (including production, work, and study), and who is not a counter-revolutionary politically or has no serious behavior of being divorced from the masses, can be admitted to the League. Those who have participated in the Three People's Principles Youth League and other reactionary parties should also be treated differently according to whether they joined voluntarily, the extent of their wrongdoings, and their current performance, and should not be rejected uniformly. The procedures for joining the League should be adapted to the actual situation and the requirements of the young masses, and should not hinder the joining of the broad masses of progressive youth due to complicated procedures.
　　Third, oppose the method of building the League in isolation from current practical movements and work. The League should be built in practical movements and work. The League is built to accomplish the tasks called for by the Party and the People's Government, and to realize the immediate demands and highest interests of the masses. Only in this way can the League that is established be tested and have close ties with the masses if it is combined with the actual movements, work, and activities needed by the masses at that time and place.
　　Fourth, the content of the League's work should be determined based on the tasks and work stipulated by the Party, the People's Government, and the trade union at that time and place, as well as the immediate demands and highest interests of the vast majority of young people. In the course of the work, the majority of young people, especially the intermediate and backward young masses, should be united to participate in various tasks and activities of the League, and their political consciousness should be enlightened and raised from these tasks and activities.
　　Fifth, the learning of League members should be combined with actual struggle and practical work. The so-called systematic study of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought is to use the viewpoint of dialectical materialism to understand the world, understand society, analyze the surrounding environment, analyze current political events, and answer various questions in life (such as family, career, love, marriage, etc.), and use Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to guide our practical actions. In addition to reading and discussion, the methods of learning should be adopted in various ways according to the different cultural and political levels of the target audience. The most basic method is to learn in struggle, in the implementation of the Party's policies, in work, in productive labor, in social services, and in practical life.
　　Sixth, the consolidation of the Youth League cannot be achieved simply by using organizational methods. Do not think that holding more meetings can strengthen the organizational concept of League members. The consolidation of the League mainly relies on: (1) strengthening and consolidating the League's ties with the broad masses of young people, especially the intermediate and backward masses; (2) giving play to the role of the League in various movements, struggles, and work; (3) promoting correct criticism and self-criticism to correct mistakes and improve work. These are the main methods of consolidating the League, and they are also the main standards for measuring whether the League's organization is consolidated.
　　Seventh, it is never advisable to use empty, dry preaching and rigid organizational forms to unite and educate young people. An effective method is to educate the masses with vivid facts based on the characteristics and needs of the young masses. We should say what the broad masses understand, do what the broad masses like to see and hear, and use various methods and organizational forms suitable for the requirements of young people (such as cultural and technical learning groups and classes, production cooperative mutual aid organizations, sports associations, singing groups, drama and dance research societies, clubs, research groups, etc.) to approach the masses, unite the masses, and educate the masses, so that various different masses, through various different methods and forms, take various different tortuous roads, gradually guide them to progress, and participate in various New Democratic undertakings and work.
　　Eighth, we should go to all places where there are masses. Work should not only be satisfied with the small circle of "progressive elements" themselves, and look down on the intermediate and backward masses. We should not discriminate against anyone (except reactionary elements), and we should boldly and freely unite them. We must do everything possible and use all methods to guide the broad masses of intermediate and backward masses to the revolutionary road.
　　Next, Feng Wenbin talked about the issue of youth work and cooperation in various aspects. He pointed out that to realize the task of uniting and educating the entire younger generation of young people, it is not enough to rely solely on the Youth League and our few youth workers. We must strive for the support of all adults and elderly people and the cooperation of all parties. The first is to rely on the strong leadership and concern of the Party. The Party's leadership over the Youth League is the decisive link in the development and work of the League. When we go to any place to carry out work, we must first go through the local Party organization and obtain the leadership of the Party. The Party organization should also regard leading youth work as its own responsibility and give various help and support to the development of youth work as much as possible. Secondly, we must cooperate with the trade union and obtain the assistance of the trade union. In factories, to carry out the work of young workers and establish the organization of the Youth League, only through the trade union and with the assistance of the trade union can our work be carried out quickly and done well. On the other hand, the organization of the League established with the help of the trade union is also a strong support for the work of the trade union. In addition, we must unite with education, culture, art, sports, and scientific workers and strive for their help in youth work. The Youth League must also help them complete various tasks.
　　Finally, Feng Wenbin talked about the issue of leadership methods. He pointed out that the leadership of the Youth League must first overcome the work style of bureaucracy and the phenomenon of busyness and chaos, strengthen the research and summary of work, and realize the leadership method of "from the masses, to the masses." Secondly, we must be good at carrying out work with emphasis in order to gain experience and guide the overall situation. Third, we must implement specific guidance and give practical work guidance to lower-level League organizations in a planned way. Fourth, we must strengthen propaganda and education work, run League schools and youth cadre training classes at all levels, and carry out correspondence work for Party newspapers, the "China Youth" weekly, and League newspapers at all levels. It should be recognized that to do a good job in the work of the League, in addition to the leadership of the Party above all else, running newspapers and periodicals and League schools well, and cultivating the backbone and cadres of the League are also key factors of decisive significance.

　　冯文彬在华东青年工作会议上
　  关于青年工作几个问题的报告
    【新华社上海十二日电】中共中央青年工作委员会书记冯文彬在华东青年工作会议中作了关于青年团工作的报告。
    他首先根据目前全国及华东的形势，提出华东当前青年运动的任务，是要动员、组织广大青年群众，克服困难，粉碎敌人的封锁。而建立和发展青年团的组织，又是动员团结广大青年群众的中心环节。
    其次，他指出：自从青年团代表大会以来，各地青年工作都有很大的成绩。目前全国团员数量约为五十万，较四个月前的十九万增加了一倍半。但各地建团工作中还相当普遍地、或多或少存在着脱离群众的关门主义偏向。这种偏向必须予以警惕和纠正。我们应该走群众路线，为团结教育青年一代而建团，不应该脱离群众、脱离实际、为建团而建团。关于这个问题，他提出八点来加以说明：
    第一，建团的目的是为了满足进步青年的要求，而更重要的是为了通过这一先进青年群众性的核心组织，团结和教育整个青年一代，把广大青年群众包括中间、落后群众团结在青年团的周围，这是测量青年团工作正确与否的唯一标准，也是关系青年团成败的基本问题。
    第二，青年团应对广大进步青年开门。既要保持其先进性，又要有广泛的群众性，反对那种把入团条件提得过高，手续订得繁复，结果把许多优秀青年都关在团的门外。团的组织，应从狭小的圈子里冲破出来，建立和加强与广大青年群众联系的基础。团员的标准，不能在团章以外附加任何与团章原则精神不符的条件。凡是思想进步，在新民主主义各种事业（包括生产、工作、学习）中表现积极的青年，在政治上不是反革命分子，无严重脱离群众的行为者，都可以吸收入团。对曾经参加三民主义青年团和其他反动党派的分子，亦应按其是否自愿加入、作恶的大小、现在的表现而分别对待，不得一律拒绝他们。入团的手续，应适合实际情况和青年群众的要求，不要因复杂的手续而妨碍了广大进步青年入团。
    第三，反对脱离当前实际运动和工作孤立地建团的方法。应在实际运动和工作中建团。建团是为了完成党和人民政府所号召的任务，为了实现群众的切身要求和最高利益。只有这样同当时当地的实际运动、工作以及群众所需要的活动结合起来，所建立的团才是经得起考验并与群众有密切联系的。
    第四，团的工作内容，应根据当时当地党、人民政府和工会所规定的任务和工作，以及最大多数青年群众的切身要求和最高利益来规定。在工作进行中，应团结大多数青年，特别是中间、落后青年群众，来参加团的各种工作和活动，并从这些工作和活动中启发和提高他们的政治觉悟。
    第五，团员的学习应同实际斗争、实际工作结合起来。所谓有系统地学习马列主义毛泽东思想，就是要用唯物辩证法的观点去认识世界、认识社会，分析周围的环境、分析当前的政治事变，解答人生的各种问题（如家庭、职业、恋爱、婚姻等），用马列主义毛泽东思想指导我们的实际行动。学习的方法，除了读书和讨论外，应当根据不同对象的文化政治水平，采取各种方式进行。最基本的方法是在斗争中、执行党的政策中、工作中、生产劳动中、社会服务中以及实际生活中学习。
    第六，青年团的巩固，不能单纯地使用组织办法。不要以为多开会就可以加强团员的组织观念。团的巩固，主要是依靠：（一）加强和巩固团与广大青年群众特别是中间、落后群众的联系；（二）发挥团在各种运动、斗争与工作中的作用；（三）发扬正确的批评和自我批评，以修正错误，改进工作。这些就是巩固团的主要方法，也是测量团的组织巩固与否的主要标准。
    第七，团结教育青年决不宜采用空洞枯燥的说教和刻板的组织形式。有效的方法是根据青年群众的特点和需要，以活生生的事实教育群众，应说广大群众所懂得的话，做广大群众所喜闻乐见的事，用各种各样适合青年要求的方法与组织形式（如文化技术学习组和班、生产合作互助组织、体育会、歌咏团、戏剧舞蹈研究会、俱乐部、研究组等）去接近群众，团结群众，教育群众，使各种不同的群众，通过各种不同的方法和形式，走各种不同的曲折的道路，逐渐引导他们走向进步，参加新民主主义的各种事业和工作。
    第八，应当到一切有群众的地方去。工作不要只满足于“进步分子”自己的小圈子，看不起中间、落后群众。我们对任何人（反动分子除外）都不应歧视，要大胆放手地去团结他们。必须尽一切可能，用一切方法，把广大中间、落后群众引导到革命道路上来。
    再次，冯文彬谈到青年工作与各方面配合的问题。他指出：要实现团结教育整个青年一代的任务，仅仅依靠青年团和我们少数青年工作者的力量是不够的，必须争取一切成年人、老年人的支持和各方面的合作。首先是依靠党的有力领导和关切。党对青年团的领导，是团的发展和工作的决定环节。我们到任何地方去进行工作，必须首先通过当地党的组织，取得党的领导。党的组织也应该把领导青年工作当作自己的责任，尽量给青年工作的开展以各种帮助和支持。其次，要同工会合作和取得工会的帮助。在工厂中开展青年工人的工作，建立青年团的组织，只有经过工会并取得工会的协助，才能使我们的工作开展得快，作得好。另一方面，由于得到工会的帮助而建立起来的团的组织，对工会工作也是一个有力的支柱。此外，要同教育、文化、艺术、体育、科学工作者结合起来，争取他们对青年工作的帮助。青年团并要帮助他们完成各项工作。
    最后，冯文彬谈到领导方法问题。他指出：青年团的领导必须首先克服事务主义的作风和忙乱现象，加强对于工作的研究和总结，实现“从群众中来到群众中去”的领导方法。其次，要善于有重点地进行工作，以便取得经验，指导全面。第三，要实行具体指导，有计划地对下级团的组织给予实际工作的指导。第四，要加强宣传教育工作，举办各级团校和青年干部训练班，开展对各级党报、“中国青年”周刊及各级团报的通讯工作。应认识做好团的工作，除了首先是党的领导之外，办好报纸、刊物和团校，培养好团的骨干和干部，也是有决定意义的关键。
