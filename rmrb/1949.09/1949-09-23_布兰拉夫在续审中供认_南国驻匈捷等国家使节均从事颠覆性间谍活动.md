Xinhua News Agency, Budapest Dispatch: On the morning of September 19th, at the Budapest People's Court's trial of state criminal Rajk and his accomplices, Prosecutor Gyula Alapi asked defendant Brankov (the judge's questioning of him had concluded on the 17th) to answer several questions. In answering one of the prosecutor's questions, Brankov confessed that the vast majority of the official representatives of Yugoslavia in Hungary were engaged in espionage activities under the direction of the Yugoslav envoy.

　　Defendant Brankov also confessed that the Tito clique's Yugoslav representatives were also conducting subversive espionage activities in other People's Democracies, and were particularly active in Czechoslovakia.

　　When the prosecutor asked the defendant what instructions the main figures of the Yugoslav State Security Administration stationed in Hungary gave him regarding methods for recruiting spies, Brankov stated that Ranković had instructed him to use secret police methods to achieve this goal.

　　The defendant confessed that, to his knowledge, the United States possesses documents detrimental to Tito and Ranković that expose all their relationships with the police, enabling the United States to maintain its control over Tito and Ranković. During the war, Ranković and a small group of guerrillas were captured by the Germans and taken to the secret police headquarters. Shortly thereafter, Ranković was released, while the other imprisoned guerrillas were shot by the Germans. This aroused suspicion among some guerrillas that Ranković had been bought off by the secret police, leading to his release. From 1941 to 1943, Tito was willing to cease fighting against the Germans under certain conditions, and he had conducted negotiations with the Germans. At the time, there was much discussion about this among his companions. Those who knew about these negotiations were sent to the most dangerous areas of the war. The same method was also used to eliminate those who did not approve of the Tito clique's collusion with the British and Americans. Hundreds of such people died.

　　At this point, Brankov confessed: Mojkić was murdered under the direct orders of Ranković and Tito. According to Brankov's confession, Ranković had issued written orders to eliminate those spies who might cause trouble, emphasizing that this had been approved by Tito.

　　At this point, the prosecutor asked defendant Rajk several questions. After the defendants' defense attorneys announced that they had no further questions to ask the defendants, the court began questioning the fourth defendant, Tibor Szőnyi.

　　In answering the chief magistrate's questions, this American spy Szőnyi said: All the accusations against him were correct, and he pleaded guilty to all the charges listed in the indictment.

　　Tito Conspired to Send Troops to Hungary to Assist Rajk in Subversive Activities

　　Defendant Brankov confirmed Rajk's confession regarding Tito's plan, which Ranković had proposed during his meeting with Rajk at the Kelebia train station.

　　The defendant said: According to Ranković's instructions, Rajk had to rely on the help of reactionary elements (i.e., chauvinistic nationalists, rich peasants, Trotskyists, and priests) to establish a bourgeois democratic system in Hungary, so that Hungary would embark on the "new path" that Yugoslavia was taking.

　　The Chief Magistrate asked: What is this "new path"?

　　Brankov replied: All the talk about building socialism as a "new path" was merely to deceive the Yugoslav people and members of the Yugoslav Communist Party.

　　The Chief Magistrate asked: Did Ranković openly tell this to Rajk?

　　Brankov replied: As far as I remember, Ranković did not say it openly, but that was the essence of the matter.

　　The Chief Magistrate asked Brankov to confront defendant Rajk. Subsequently, Brankov had to admit that Ranković did not (text missing in the telegram) talk about "building socialism" being merely to deceive the Yugoslav people.

　　The defendant confessed that Ranković allowed Yugoslavia to provide Rajk with military assistance. Tito would send several Yugoslav battalions dressed in Hungarian uniforms to Hungary, and also send the former Horthy troops currently stationed in the Western occupied zone of Austria through Yugoslavia to Hungary to aid Rajk.

　　The defendant confessed: In 1946 and 1947, Tito sent his representatives to various People's Democracies, all of whom were officially called representatives of the Yugoslav Communist Party. The defendant said that he belonged to this category of representatives stationed in Hungary. In Czechoslovakia, the current envoy Novošel is such a representative, and he is still alive. In Bulgaria, they were Kovaćević and Zćimir, in Albania, Delje and Latić, and in Poland, another Kovaćević. The defendant confessed that the purpose of these representatives was to strengthen propaganda and carry out subversive activities within the Communist Parties and state institutions of the People's Democracies.

　　The defendant revealed that the consular section of the Yugoslav embassy in Budapest was engaged in forging documents for those Yugoslav diplomats and citizens who were engaged in espionage activities.

　　The defendant said that he knew about the secret meeting between Ranković and Rajk in the suburbs of Bácska Topola, which Mrazović had told him. The defendant continued, stating that during a routine visit to Belgrade, Brankov had expressed dissatisfaction with Rajk's sluggishness, emphasizing that he could work harder and assassinate Rákosi and other leaders of the Hungarian state at night. To assist Rajk, Ranković sent two spies to Hungary – the experienced political assassins Ivanović and Ujkić, who had been tracking Rákosi. It is said that Ivanović has left Hungary, and Ujnoci returned to Belgrade at the end of 1948.

　　Tito Colluded with the US and Britain to Carry Out Base Anti-Soviet Activities

　　The defendant confessed that Đilas, who was also present during his meeting with Ranković, said that Tito had met with Americans and British, and had reached an agreement with them that they would support the Tito government's anti-Soviet struggle, not only economically but also militarily, if Tito carried out an anti-Soviet struggle.

　　Brankov stated: In this last meeting with Ranković, he told him that it was now impossible to work in Hungary in the old way. To carry out his orders, he was to return to Budapest and issue a public statement declaring his break with Tito's policies. Ranković noticed his hesitation, and therefore claimed: This is a direct order from Tito. At the same time, Ranković gave him specific instructions on how he should act in the future. First, he had to win the trust of the leadership of the Hungarian Working People's Party. Second, after he succeeded in this regard, he should continue to maintain secret contact with the Hungarian conspirator Rajk and others. Third, he had to establish contact with Yugoslav spies Salaj, Ognjenović, Justus, and others.

　　Brankov confessed: Ranković had ordered him to obtain materials that could be used to discredit the Hungarian Working People's Party and Yugoslav political exiles. The defendant said: Ranković intended to maintain contact with him through Sakota, the embassy counselor who was about to arrive in Budapest.

　　In court, the defendant Brankov tried to portray himself as someone who had "changed his goals and sought other ways," and who only obeyed his superiors out of habit. He had supposedly only written his false statement refusing to follow Tito after receiving a threatening letter from Ranković warning Brankov that his family would suffer.

　　However, Brankov's statement that he regularly visited Sakota's residence after his statement had been published refuted his above assertions.

　　Brankov stated: In November 1948, he met Rajk, and in later meetings, he told him about the task he had received, and he repeatedly reminded him that Ranković was urging him to fulfill the plan. In February, he met Sakota at the place they had agreed upon. There were a total of four such meetings. In the first two, he told him what Ranković had asked to be conveyed to Rajk. Ranković asked Rajk to hurry up and asked why he was not organizing assassinations. In the latter two meetings, Sakota told him that Ranković was not satisfied with his work. He continued that if he did not act as required, Ranković would carry out his threats.

　　The defendant once again claimed that he had decided to effectively break off relations with Tito shortly before he was arrested.

　　Near the end of today's court trial, Brankov confessed to the case of the assassination of Miloš Mojkić. He revealed that Miloš Mojkić was a spy for the State Security Administration and had been in contact with Ranković. After the Cominform issued its resolution, Miloš Mojkić announced his intention to break away from the Tito group. Brankov said that he had informed Ranković of this matter and received his order to eliminate the spy. Mrazović confirmed this order and told me that if I was afraid to carry out this task, he would hand his pistol over to someone else. This task must be completed, because all of Ranković's instructions were sacrosanct. He handed his pistol to Brankov, who then went through Borov to carry out this task.

　　The trial on the 17th ended here. The trial will resume on Monday, September 19th.

　　布兰拉夫在续审中供认
  　南国驻匈捷等国家使节均从事颠覆性间谍活动
    【新华社讯】塔斯社布达佩斯讯：九月十九日上午，在审讯国事犯拉伊克及其同谋的布达佩斯人民法庭上，检察官齐犹拉·亚拉比问被告布兰科夫（法官对他的诘讯已于十七日完毕），要他回答几个问题。布兰科夫在回答检查官的一个问题时，供称，南斯拉夫驻匈牙利绝大多数的官方代表都在南斯拉夫公使的指挥下从事间谍活动。
    被告布兰科夫也供称，铁托集团的南斯拉夫代表也在其他人民民主国家进行颠覆性的间谍活动，而在捷克斯洛伐克则特别活跃。
    当检察官问被告南斯拉夫国家保安处驻匈牙利的主要人物给了他关于招雇间谍的方法的怎样指示时，布兰科夫称，兰科维奇曾指示他用秘密警察的方法来达到这个目的。
    被告供称，就我所知，美国握有不利于铁托与兰科维奇并且有暴露他们和警察的一切关系的文件，这些文件使美国能保持铁托和兰科维奇受它的支配。在战争期间，兰科维奇和一小群游击队被德国人捉住了，并且被带到秘密警察机关去。不久，兰科维奇便获释了，而其他被囚禁的游击队员却遭德国人枪毙。这曾引起某些游击队员怀疑兰科维奇已被秘密警察收买，因而把他释放了。自一九四一年到一九四三年间，铁托愿意在一定的条件下停止对德人的斗争，他曾与德人进行谈判。当时在他的同伴当中曾对此议论纷纷。那些知道这些谈判的人，则被送往战争最危险的地带去。同样的方法也被用来消灭掉那些不赞同铁托集团与英国人及美国人勾结的人。这类人就有数百名身死。
    至此，布兰科夫供称：莫伊奇系在兰科维奇与铁托的直接训令下遭杀害的。据布兰科夫的供辞，兰科维奇曾下达关于把那些可能带来祸害的间谍加以消灭的书面命令，并强调说这是已获铁托的批准的。
    至此，检察官问被告拉伊克几个问题。在被告的辩护士宣布没有什么问题询问被告们后，法庭便开始审问第四名被告提波尔·佐恩尼。
    在答复首席推事的问题时，这个美国间谍佐恩尼说：所有一切对他的控告都是正确的，并对起诉书中所列举的一切罪状服罪。
    铁托曾阴谋派军队赴匈助拉伊克进行颠覆活动
    被告布兰科夫证实拉伊克关于铁托计划的供词，该计划是兰科维奇在与拉伊克会晤于凯利比亚车站时所提出的。
    被告说：依照兰科维奇的训令，拉伊克必须依靠反动分子（即沙文主义的民族主义者，富农，托洛斯基分子和牧师）的帮助来在匈牙利建立资产阶级民主制度，以使得匈牙利走上南斯拉夫所正走着的“新路”。
    首席推事问：这个“新路”是什么？
    布兰科夫回答说：一切关于建设社会主义的新路的谈话都仅是为了愚弄南斯拉夫人民与南共党员的。
    首席推事问：兰科维奇是否把这事公开地告诉了拉伊克？
    布兰科夫答：就我所记忆的，兰科维奇并未公开说过，但这是事情的本质。
    首席推事要布兰科夫同被告拉伊克对质，随后，布兰科夫不得不承认，兰科维奇不但没有（电文脱漏）谈论“建设社会主义”仅仅是用以欺骗南斯拉夫人民而已。
    被告供称，兰科维奇允许南斯拉夫予拉伊克以军事援助，铁托将派遣几个着匈牙利军装的南斯拉夫营到匈牙利，而且也派现在留在奥境西方占领区的前霍尔梯军队假道南斯拉夫到匈牙利去，以来援助拉伊克。
    被告供称：在一九四六年及一九四七年，铁托把他的均正式称之为南斯拉夫共产党代表的那些代表派往各人民民主国家。被告称，我就是属于这类驻匈牙利的代表。在捷克斯洛伐克，现任公使诺伏谢尔就是这类代表，而他到现在还活着，在保加利亚，为柯瓦西维奇和兹齐米尔，在阿尔巴尼亚为迪列德耶和拉提奇，在波兰为另外一个柯瓦西维奇。被告供称，这些代表的目的乃加强宣传，在人民民主国家的共产党和国家机构中进行颠覆活动。
    被告透露，布达佩斯的南斯拉夫公使馆的领事部从事于为那些进行间谍活动的南斯拉夫外交官以及公民伪造文件。
    被告称，他知道兰科维奇和拉伊克在巴克斯城郊的秘密会谈，那是姆拉佐维奇告诉他的。被告继称，在例行的访贝尔格莱德期间，布兰科夫曾经对拉伊克的疲塌表示不满，并着重称，他可以更起劲地干，和在夜里谋杀拉科西和匈牙利国家的其他领袖。为了协助拉伊克，兰科维奇派了两名间谍到匈牙利去，——老练的政治刺客伊凡诺维奇和尤伊基奇，他们曾跟踪拉科西。据说伊凡基维奇已离开匈牙利，尤伊诺奇于一九四八年底也回贝尔格莱德了。
    铁托与美英相勾结进行卑鄙反苏活动
    被告供称，在我与兰科维奇会谈时亦在场的德热拉斯说，铁托曾与美国人和英国人会谈过，而且跟他们达成协议，即他们将支持铁托政府进行的反苏斗争，不仅在经济上，而且也在军事上支持它，如果铁托进行反苏联的斗争的话。
    布兰科夫称：在与兰科维奇的这次最后的会谈中，他告诉我现在不可能以老方法在匈牙利工作，执行他的命令，我就要回到布达佩斯并且发表公开声明，表示我与铁托政策决裂。兰科维奇注意到我犹豫不决，因此声称：这是铁托的直接的命令。同时，兰科维奇给我以我在将来应该如何如何的具体训令。首先，我要赢得匈牙利劳动人民党的领导机构的信任。第二，当我在这方面获得成功后，就继续与匈牙利阴谋者拉伊克和其他人保持秘密的接触。第三，我要与南斯拉夫的间谍萨莱、奥格涅诺维区、尤斯图斯和其他等人建立联系。
    布兰科夫供称：兰科维奇曾命令他去获取可用以诋毁匈牙利劳动人民党和南斯拉夫政治流亡者的材料。被告称：兰科维奇打算通过那时即将来布达佩斯的公使馆参事萨科塔与我保持接触。
    被告布兰科夫在法庭上，力图把自己说成“改变目的另谋他途”、且只是由于习惯才服从其上司的人。他曾经据说是仅仅在收到兰科维奇的一封警告布兰科夫说他的家庭将受罪的威胁信后，才写下他拒绝追随铁托的假声明。
    然而布兰科夫说：在他的声明已经发表后，他还定期访问萨科塔的住所，这一说法把他上面的断言推翻了。
    布兰科夫称：在一九四八年十一月，我会到了拉伊克，在后来的会谈中，我曾告诉他我已接到的任务，并且我曾反复提醒他说：兰科维奇在催促履行计划。二月间，我在我们所商定的地方会见了萨科塔。这样的会晤共有四次。头两次他告诉我兰科维奇所要求传给拉伊克的东西。兰科维奇要求拉伊克赶紧办，并问他为什么不组织暗杀。在后两次会晤中，萨科塔告诉我说兰科维奇不满意我的工作。他继称，假若我不照所需要的去作的话，兰科维奇就要执行他的威胁。
    被告又一次声称，在他被捕以前不久他就已决定与铁托实际断绝来往了。
    在今天法庭审判将近结束时，布兰科夫供认关于暗杀米洛施·莫伊奇的案情。他透露，米洛施·莫伊奇曾是国家保安处的间谍，并且曾与兰科维奇有联系。在情报局发表决议之后，米洛施·莫伊奇便宣布他意欲脱离铁托集团。布兰科夫说他将这件事情通知了兰科维奇，并接到他的关于要干掉这个间谍的命令。姆拉佐维奇证实了这个命令，并告诉我说，假若我害怕执行这个任务的话，他将把他的手枪交给另一个人，这个任务必须完成，因为兰科维奇的一切训令都是神圣不可侵犯的。他就将他的手枪交给布兰科夫，而布兰科夫则经由博罗夫去执行这个任务。
    十七日的审判就此结束。九月十九日（星期一）再行审判。
