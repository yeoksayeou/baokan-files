Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 1st: US imperialism is unilaterally implementing a so-called "undeclared peace" plan with Japan, to replace the conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan through legal procedures. According to the American "U.S. News & World Report" quoted by the Soviet "New Times" magazine published on June 22: "The United States is not in a hurry to sign a peace treaty that would take away the power it currently holds in Japan. On the contrary, the United States will maintain a state of undeclared peace to build Japan." "New Times" pointed out that this view of the United States has been warmly responded to by the Japanese ruling class. Japanese Prime Minister Yoshida recently put forward a plan advocating the establishment of "de facto peaceful relations" without signing a treaty with all relevant countries.
	It is worth noting that the US government has recently publicly admitted that it will implement this "undeclared peace" plan with Japan. US State Department spokesman White announced on August 18: "The US government believes that promoting exchanges between Japan and other countries will be of great importance in promoting Japan's growth." According to White's explanation, this "exchange" includes participating in international conferences, exchanging consuls, or engaging in other bilateral activities. According to a Reuters report on the 28th, after this announcement by the US State Department, the Japanese Foreign Ministry, which had been virtually inactive since its surrender, suddenly became active. The report then quoted a message from Japan's Jiji Shimbun saying: People in the Japanese Foreign Ministry expect that by the end of this year, Japan will be able to establish consulates in major US cities, including New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago, New Orleans, Denver, Seattle and Honolulu. Jiji Shimbun also revealed that the consulates established in the United States belong to the first category. The second category will be consulates established in major cities in Central and South American countries, as well as Canada, Korea, India, Pakistan, Burma, and Thailand. The third category is to establish consulates in London, Paris, Alexandria, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Hanoi. The fourth category is to establish consulates in Batavia, Manila, and Sydney. This plan of the US government further exposes the US's great conspiracy to delay the peace treaty with Japan, monopolize Japan, and use Japan to carry out aggression in the Far East and other places.

### 美帝阴谋扩张侵略　妄图对日“不宣而和”　日本外交部正计划在美设领事

　　美帝阴谋扩张侵略
  　妄图对日“不宣而和”
  　日本外交部正计划在美设领事
    【新华社北平一日电】美帝国主义正在对日本独断地实行所谓“不宣而和”的计划，以代替按照合法程序缔结对日和约。据六月二十二日出版的苏联新时代杂志引美国新闻与世界报透露：“美国并不忙于签订一个将会夺去它目前在日本所握有的权力的和约。相反地，美国将保持一种不宣布的和平，以建设日本。”新时代指出：美国这种意见，已获得日本统治阶级的热烈响应。日本首相吉田最近已提出一个计划，主张不用与一切有关国家签订和约而建立“事实上的和平关系”。
    值得注意的是，美国官方最近已公开承认它将对日本实行这种“不宣而和”的计划。美国务院发言人怀特八月十八日宣布：“美国政府相信，推广日本与其他国家间的交往，在促进日本的成长中，将具有极重要地位。”根据怀特的解释，这种“交往”包括参加国际会议，交换领事或从事其他双边活动。据路透社二十八日电，在美国务院这一宣布以后，自投降以来事实上即无活动的日本外交部，已突然活动起来。该电继引日本时事新报的消息说：日本外交部人士预料，在今年年底以前，日本可在美国各主要城市设立领事馆，其中包括纽约、旧金山、洛杉矶、芝加哥、新奥尔良、丹佛、西雅图与檀香山。时事新报又透露，在美国设立的领事馆，属于第一类。第二类将是在中南美各国及加拿大、朝鲜、印度、巴基斯坦、缅甸、泰国等国的大城市中设立领事馆。第三类是在伦敦、巴黎、亚历山大港、香港、新加坡与河内设立领事馆。第四类是在巴达维亚、马尼拉、悉尼设立领事馆。美国政府的这一计划，更加暴露了美国拖延对日和约，独占日本，并利用日本向远东及其他地方实行侵略的大阴谋。
