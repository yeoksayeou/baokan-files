　　North China Cotton Yarn Company
  　Vigorously Organizes Rational Cotton Purchase
  　5 Million Jin Purchased in 20 Days
    [This City News] In order to implement the cotton purchase policy, protect the interests of cotton farmers, and organize a large amount of cotton purchase to supply the textile industry, the North China Cotton Yarn Company convened a meeting of branch managers from the entire North China region on August 22nd, lasting seven days, and decided on issues such as cotton purchase prices and cotton purchase organization. Regarding the cotton purchase price, it was stipulated that the price of standard cotton (fiber length 7/8 inch) at the place of origin would be standardized at ten jin of millet per jin for the whole year and the whole region, and it was guaranteed to be no less than nine jin of millet, in order to effectively protect the interests of cotton farmers. Regarding the cotton purchase organization, it was decided that the Cotton Yarn Company, the Grain Company, and the Department Store Company must closely cooperate. On the one hand, they should purchase cotton, and on the other hand, they should sell grain and daily necessities to farmers in cotton-producing areas. The Grain Company and the Department Store Company must actively cooperate with the Cotton Yarn Company in the cotton purchase work, and it was decided that they must closely integrate with the cooperatives and conduct purchases through the cooperatives. However, since the cooperative business in North China is not very widespread at present, and the cooperatives cannot complete such a huge cotton purchase task, it is necessary to universally organize private merchants and organ production to carry out cotton purchase work, and organize private merchants to implement joint purchase methods to jointly complete the cotton purchase task. In order to prevent speculators from speculating and manipulating in the cotton purchase process, it was specifically decided that market management should be strengthened in various cotton-producing areas, and illegal activities such as adulteration with water should be severely punished. It was also decided to closely integrate with the Tianjin China Textile Company and ask China Textile to send technicians to participate in the cotton purchase work. In addition, the meeting made specific decisions on issues such as grading, pressing, ginning, storage, transportation, and capital utilization, and formulated a cotton yarn management system, strictly implementing the reporting system for business conditions, sales, and cash storage and transportation.
    [Another News] The eight branches of the North China Cotton Yarn Company in Beijing, Tangshan, Baoding, Shijiazhuang, Linqing, Handan, Xinxiang, and Taiyuan, and the twenty-two sub-branches in Tongzhou, Nanyuan, Zhuozhou, Dingxian, Gaoyang, Xinji, Nangong, Anyang, Heze, Linfen, and Yuci, have sent nearly one hundred township cotton purchase teams to carry out cotton purchase. Since September 1st, they have actively launched the purchase of new cotton, and by September 20th, they had purchased more than 5 million jin of new cotton.
    In addition, two training classes for cotton purchase technicians of the company, with a total of more than 200 students, have graduated one after another and have been distributed to various regions for cotton purchase work.　　　　　　 　(Hua Xin Shi)

　　华北花纱布公司
  　大力组织合理购棉
  　廿天已收购五百万斤
    【本市讯】华北花纱布公司为贯彻收棉政策，保障棉农利益，组织大量收购棉花，以供给纺织工业，曾于八月廿二日召开华北全区分公司经理会议，共历时七天，决定了收棉价格、收棉组织等问题。关于收棉价格，规定产地标准棉（纤维长度八分之七英寸），每斤价格全年全区以十斤小米为标准，并保证不低于九斤小米，以切实保障棉农利益。关于收棉组织，决定花纱布公司与粮食公司百货公司必须密切配合，一方面收购棉花，一方面把粮食与日用品出售给棉产区的农民。粮食公司与百货公司必须主动的配合花纱布公司进行收花工作，并决定必须与合作社密切结合，通过合作社进行收购。但由于目前华北合作事业发展不很普遍，合作社还不能完成如此巨大的购棉任务，因此必须普遍组织私商及机关生产进行购棉工作，并组织私商实行联购办法，共同完成收棉任务。为防止收棉过程中奸商投机操纵，特决定在各产棉区，应加强市场管理，并严惩使水掺杂等不法行为，并决定与天津中纺公司密切结合，请中纺派遣技术人员参与收花工作。此外在分级、压花、榨花、保管、运输及资金运用等问题上，会议均已有具体的决定，并制定了花纱布管理制度，严格执行商情、进销、现金储运情况的表报制度。
    【又讯】华北花纱布公司设立之北京、唐山、保定、石家庄、临清、邯郸、新乡、太原八个分公司及通州、南苑、涿州、定县、高阳、辛集、南宫、安阳、菏泽、临汾、榆次等二十二个支公司，派出近一百个集镇收花小组，进行收花。自九月一日起积极展开收购新棉业务，迄九月二十日止，共已收购新棉五百余万斤。
    又该公司收花技术训练班，两期学员共二百余人先后毕业，已分发到各地区进行收花工作。　　　　　　 　（华新室）
