Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 23rd: TASS Moscow reports: *Pravda* published an editorial on the 21st entitled "Spies and Murderers in Power," commenting on the Hungarian treason trial, saying: The Budapest trial is increasingly revealing a picture of the conspiracies of the imperialist bloc against the people's democratic system, against peace, democracy, and socialism in Hungary and other people's democracies.

　　The indictment has proven beyond any doubt that the manipulators of this conspiracy are the imperialist bloc, and they assigned the leading role in implementing this conspiracy to the fascist Tito-Ranković group. Most of Tito's intimate confidants are spies of foreign imperialist intelligence agencies. The confession of the spy and traitor Brankov (one of the most active agents of the Tito-Ranković fascist group) makes it clear to everyone what the Tito elements who have fallen into the net look like. Brankov confessed that Đilas, Kardelj, and Ranković were the first to be recruited by the Americans and British as agents.

　　*Pravda* continued: The bourgeois nationalists of Yugoslavia are truly valuable people to foreign imperialist intelligence agencies. International imperialist reactionaries have repeatedly attempted to rely on the help of the compromised bourgeois parties in the people's democracies to restore reactionary regimes, but have repeatedly failed. In such a situation, in the struggle against the young democratic countries, the imperialists placed their hopes on a desperate gamble to overthrow the people's democratic regime with the help of espionage conspiracies, betrayal, murder, and intervention. In this vile subversive work, the main role was given to the fascist Tito group, which carried out the tasks of the imperialist intelligence agencies. *Pravda* concluded: The Budapest trial shows how far the fascist Tito group has fallen! The Yugoslav government, a collection of spies and murderers, has doomed the Yugoslav people to the most severe suffering, hunger, poverty, and inequality. The best sons and daughters of the Yugoslav people are heroically resisting the fascist rulers of Yugoslavia and are reviving the revolutionary Communist Party, which is faithful to the principles of internationalism. The Tito-Ranković group will be swept away by the people's anger, and neither bloody terror nor espionage serving imperialism can save the Tito-Ranković group from its doom.

　　铁托为帝国主义效劳
    决拯救不了它的灭亡
  　真理报评论匈审讯叛国案
    【新华社北平二十三日电】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报二十一日发表题为“间谍与凶手当权”的一篇社论，评论匈牙利叛国案的审判说：布达佩斯的审讯，愈来愈清楚地揭示出：帝国主义集团在匈牙利及其他人民民主国家中反对人民民主制度，反对和平、民主与社会主义的阴谋诡计的图画。
    起诉书已证据确凿地证明了这阴谋的操纵者是帝国主义集团，他们把执行这阴谋计划的领导角色，分配给了法西斯铁托——兰科维奇集团。铁托的大部分推心置腹的密友，正是外国帝国主义特务机关的间谍。间谍与奸细布兰科夫（铁托——兰科维奇法西斯集团最活跃的代理人之一）的供词，使所有人都能看清楚已陷入罗网之中的铁托分子的面目。布兰科夫供认：首先被美国人与英国人招募充当代理人的，便是德热拉斯、卡德尔和兰科维奇。
    真理报继续说：南斯拉夫的资产阶级民族主义者，是对外国帝国主义特务机关真正有价值的人。国际帝国主义反动派屡次企图依靠人民民主国家中资产阶级的妥协的政党之助，而使反动政权复辟，但结果屡次遭遇了失败。在这样的情形下，帝国主义者在对年青的民主国家进行斗争中，就把希望寄托在由间谍阴谋、变节、谋杀与干涉的帮助来完成推翻人民民主政权的孤注一掷上。在这龌龊的颠覆性的工作中，主要的脚色是交给了执行帝国主义特务机关的任务的法西斯铁托集团。真理报最后说：布达佩斯的审讯，说明了法西斯的铁托集团已堕落到怎样的地步！集间谍与凶手之大成的南斯拉夫政府，已使南斯拉夫人民注定要遭受最严重的苦难、饥饿、贫困与不平等。南斯拉夫人民最优秀的子孙正英勇地反抗南斯拉夫的法西斯统治者，并且正在使忠实于国际主义原则的革命的共产党复苏。铁托——兰科维奇集团将被人民的愤怒扫除干净，而且，不论是血腥的恐怖，还是替帝国主义效劳的间谍活动，都是拯救不了铁托——兰科维奇集团的灭亡。
