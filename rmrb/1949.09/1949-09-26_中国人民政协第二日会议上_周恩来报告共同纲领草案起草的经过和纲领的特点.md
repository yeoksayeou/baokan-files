Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 25th: At the second day's meeting of the Plenary Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the last important procedure was a report by Zhou Enlai, leader of the Third Group of the Preparatory Committee, on the drafting process and characteristics of the draft "Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference." Zhou first outlined the drafting process, saying: The Third Group decided that the Chinese Communist Party would be responsible for drafting the initial draft. After the initial draft was written, excluding discussions within each unit, it underwent seven rounds of repeated discussions and revisions. Approximately five to six hundred representatives to the CPPCC who arrived in Beiping successively discussed it in groups twice, the Third Group itself discussed it three times, and the Standing Committee of the Preparatory Committee discussed it twice, extensively absorbing opinions from all sides. Then, the draft was submitted to the Second Plenary Meeting of the Preparatory Committee and basically passed. Now, it is submitted to the Plenary Session of the CPPCC for discussion. Zhou Enlai presented and explained the following issues that were emphasized during the consultation. He said:

    The Question of the Chinese People's Democratic United Front

    First is the question of the Chinese People's Democratic United Front. Based on historical facts, Zhou Enlai explained that the initiation of this united front dates back to the First Great Revolution. Due to the proposal and efforts of the Chinese Communist Party, Mr. Sun Yat-sen agreed, reorganized the Kuomintang, and promoted the cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, which led to the victorious Northern Expedition. Later, this united front was destroyed by Chiang Kai-shek, but the Chinese Communist Party continued to work hard to organize the people's anti-imperialist and anti-feudal united front. In particular, Chairman Mao further developed and successfully implemented this policy. However, the Kuomintang reactionaries consistently opposed the united front. They launched three anti-communist upsurges during the Anti-Japanese War and overturned the Double Tenth Agreement and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference after the end of the Anti-Japanese War, finally launching a large-scale civil war. This civil war educated the people, making the vast majority of the people gradually and consistently support the People's Liberation Army in carrying out the Liberation War, eliminating the reactionaries, and carrying the revolution through to the end. Last year, based on the consistent主張 of the united front, the CPC called for a new Political Consultative Conference, which received enthusiastic responses from the people and various democratic parties across the country. This call has been realized today. Our purpose is very clear, as stipulated in the draft Common Program and the Organic Law of the CPPCC, which is to implement New Democracy, oppose imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and build a new China that is independent, democratic, peaceful, unified, and prosperous. For this task, we unite all democratic classes, all nationalities, and overseas Chinese at home and abroad to form such a great people's democratic united front. This is not only the主張 for which the CPC has struggled for twenty-eight years, but also what is supported and sponsored by various democratic parties, people's organizations, regions, armies, domestic minorities, overseas Chinese, and all patriotic democrats. In his "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship" essay on July 1st of this year, Chairman Mao clearly pointed out that the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and the people's democratic united front guaranteed the victory of the people's democratic revolution today. Therefore, in the discussion of the Preparatory Committee, everyone believed that such a united front should continue throughout the entire New Democratic period and needs to be formed organizationally to promote its development. Everyone agreed that the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is its best organizational form.

    During the discussion, two other ideas emerged: The first thought that after the National People's Congress was convened, there would be no need for an organization like the CPPCC; the second thought that because the parties were so united in promoting the rapid development of New Democracy, the existence of parties would not last long. Later, everyone agreed in the discussion that these two ideas were inappropriate because they did not meet the needs of the development and construction of the Chinese revolution. The convening of the universally elected National People's Congress will indeed still take a considerable amount of time, but even after the universally elected National People's Congress is convened, the CPPCC will still play a consultative, advisory, and promotional role in the work of the central government. Secondly, since there are classes in the New Democratic era, there will be parties. The rulers of old democratic countries are the bourgeoisie, and their factions must exclude each other and fight for power and profit. Under the leadership of the working class, although the interests and opinions of the classes in the New Democracy still have differences, they can achieve consistency on common demands and major policies. The draft Common Program passed by the Preparatory Committee is the most obvious proof. The different demands and contradictions within the people's democratic united front can and should be adjusted in the face of the struggle against the remnants of imperialism and feudalism.

    The General Program of New Democracy

    Zhou Enlai then talked about the second issue, namely the general program of New Democracy. He said: During the discussion of the general program, there was an opinion that since we recognize that New Democracy is a transitional stage that must develop towards the higher stages of socialism and communism, the general program should clearly stipulate this future. During the discussion of the Preparatory Committee, everyone believed that this future is certain and beyond doubt, but it should be proven to the people through explanation, publicity, and especially practice. Only when the people recognize in their own practice that this is the only and best future will they truly acknowledge it and be willing to wholeheartedly strive for it. Therefore, not writing it out for the time being does not negate it, but treats it more solemnly. Moreover, the economic part of this program already stipulates that it will actually guarantee that we will move towards this future.

    There are very clear provisions in the general program regarding the people's rights and obligations to the state. A definition needs to be explained, that is, there is a distinction between "people" and "nationals." "People" refers to the working class, the peasant class, the petty bourgeoisie, the national bourgeoisie, and some patriotic democrats who have awakened from the reactionary classes. As for the bureaucratic bourgeoisie after their property is confiscated and the landlord class after their land is distributed, the negative aspect is to severely suppress their reactionary activities, and the positive aspect is to force them to work more and transform them into new people. Before they are transformed, they are not within the scope of the people, but they are still a national of China. They are temporarily not given the rights of the people, but they need to abide by the obligations of the nationals. This is the people's democratic dictatorship. This is beneficial to the unity and production of our People's Republic of China.

    Zhou Enlai's report at this point particularly reminded everyone to pay attention: the important reactionaries in these reactionary classes will never be willing to lose their past privileges and will definitely carry out conspiracies and sabotage. The recent murder of General Yang Jie is an example. The people's army and police will strengthen their work to prevent their conspiracies and sabotage. We must all strengthen our unity and raise our vigilance to combat all kinds of conspiracies of the reactionaries.

    The Political System of New Democracy

    The third issue reported by Zhou Enlai was the political system of New Democracy. Zhou Enlai analyzed the deceptive nature of the old democracy of the bourgeoisie, pointing out that the political system of New Democracy is a government of the people's congress under democratic centralism, which is completely different from the parliamentary system of the old democracy, but belongs to the category of the congress system headed by the socialist Soviet Union. However, it is also not entirely the same as the Soviet system. The Soviet Union has eliminated classes, while we are an alliance of all revolutionary classes. This characteristic of ours is manifested in the form of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. The various departments of the government, the current people's representative conferences in various places, and the future National People's Congress will all show this characteristic in the same way. The entire process, from the people electing representatives, convening the People's Congress, electing the People's Government, to the People's Government exercising state power during the adjournment of the People's Congress, is a process of democratic centralism in the exercise of state power. The organs that exercise state power are the People's Congress at all levels and the People's Government at all levels.

    The Military System, Economic and Cultural Policies of New Democracy

    The fourth issue is the military system. It is by no means accidental that the People's Liberation Army has achieved today's victory and won the support of the people of the whole country. Its characteristics are not only brave, resourceful and good at combat, but also able to correctly implement policies and help the people in their labor. The political work system is its soul. This military system is not only different from the feudal warlords, but also different from the military system of the bourgeoisie. The program stipulates that this new democratic military system will be used to unify the armies of the whole country, including all the armies that have revolted from the Kuomintang reactionary rule. This approach is obviously different from the annexation and squeezing of the warlord system, but to help them transform into the people's army regardless of each other.

    Fifth, the basic spirit of the economic policy of New Democracy is to take care of all aspects, that is, to implement the policy of taking into account both public and private interests, both labor and capital, mutual assistance between urban and rural areas, and internal and external exchanges, to achieve the goal of developing production and prospering the economy. Among the five economic components of New Democracy, the state-owned economy is the leading component. Gradually realizing the requirements of planned economy, so that the whole society can get what it needs and achieve the effect of division of labor and cooperation, is an arduous and must be realized task. The economic part was the most discussed during the preparatory period, and the good opinions of all parties have been concentrated in the articles of the draft. There are many things to be done in economic construction, but there must be a distinction between urgency and importance. The draft has analyzed and stipulated specific articles based on what should be done, what should not be done; what can be done now, what cannot be done now; what has been done, and what has not been done.

    Sixth is the cultural policy of New Democracy. This issue was not discussed much. To put it simply, it is a national form, scientific content, and mass direction. The draft stipulates several items that must be emphasized. Other items not stipulated are not not to be done, because they have all been generally mentioned in Chapter 5 of the draft.

    The National and Foreign Policy Issues of New Democracy

    Seventh is the national policy issue of New Democracy. The basic spirit is to make the People's Republic of China a big family of friendship and cooperation among all nationalities. It is necessary to oppose the common enemies within all nationalities and external imperialism. In the big family of all nationalities, it is also necessary to constantly oppose the tendency of great nationalism and narrow nationalism. The regional autonomy of all ethnic minorities, the right to bear arms, and the respect for their religious beliefs are all clearly stipulated in the articles.

    Eighth is the foreign policy issue of New Democracy. Chapter 7 of the draft clearly stipulates what to guarantee, what to support, and what to oppose. That is to guarantee the integrity of national independence, freedom, and territorial sovereignty, support lasting international peace and friendly cooperation among the peoples of all countries, and oppose the imperialist policy of aggression and war. The general program has clearly accepted Chairman Mao's instruction in "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship" to stand with the Soviet Union and other new democratic countries. Everyone recognizes that there is absolutely no middle camp between the international peace and democratic camp and the imperialist aggressive camp.

### 中国人民政协第二日会议上　周恩来报告共同纲领草案起草的经过和纲领的特点

　　中国人民政协第二日会议上
  　周恩来报告共同纲领草案起草的经过和纲领的特点
    【新华社北平二十五日电】人民政协全体会议第二日最后一项重要程序为筹备会第三组组长周恩来报告“中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领”草案起草的经过和纲领的特点。周首先概述起草的经过说：第三小组决定由中国共产党负责起草草案初稿。初稿写出以后，除各单位自己讨论不计外，经过七次的反复的讨论和修改，计由先后到达北平的政协代表五六百人分组讨论两次，第三组本身讨论了三次，筹备会常务委员会讨论了两次，广泛地吸收了各方面的意见，然后将草案提交筹备会第二次全体会议作了基本通过，现在提交政协全体会议讨论。协商过程中着重讨论到的有如下几个问题，周恩来逐一提出并加以说明。他说：
    中国人民民主统一战线问题
    第一是中国人民民主统一战线的问题。周恩来根据历史事实，说明这种统一战线的发起远在第一次大革命时期。由于中国共产党的提议和努力，获得了孙中山先生的同意，改组了国民党，促成了国共合作，胜利地举行了北伐。后来这个统一战线被蒋介石破坏了，但是中国共产党仍然努力组织人民的反帝反封建的统一战线，尤其是毛主席更使这个政策得到了进一步的发展和成功。可是国民党反动派是始终反对统一战线的，它在抗日战争时期发动三次反共高潮，而在抗日战争结束以后又推翻双十协议和政协决议，最后终于发动了大规模的内战。这次内战教育了人民，使广大人民逐渐的走到一致拥护人民解放军进行解放战争，消灭反动派，把革命进行到底。去年中共根据历来统一战线的主张，号召召开新的政治协商会议，得到了全国人民及各民主党派热烈的响应，发展到今天，这个号召已经实现了。大家的目的很明确，正如共同纲领草案和人民政协组织法所规定的那样，是实行新民主主义，反对帝国主义、封建主义、和官僚资本主义，建设一个独立、民主、和平、统一和富强的新中国。为着这个任务，我们团结国内各民主阶级，各民族和国外华侨，结成这样一个伟大的人民民主统一战线。这不仅是中共为之奋斗了二十八年的主张，也是各民主党派，各人民团体，各区域、军队、国内少数民族、国外华侨，以及一切爱国民主人士所拥护和赞助的。毛主席在今年七一“论人民民主专政”的论文中，明确地指出中国共产党、中国人民解放军和人民民主的统一战线保证了人民民主革命取得今天的胜利。所以在筹备会讨论中，大家认为在整个新民主主义时期，这样一个统一战线应当继续下去，而且需要在组织上形成起来，以推动它的发展。大家同意：中国人民政治协商会议，就是它的最好的组织形式。
    在讨论中曾经出现过两种其他的想法：第一种以为等到人民代表大会召开之后，就再不需要人民政协这样的组织了；第二种以为由于各党派这样团结一致，推动新民主主义很快的发展，党派的存在就不会很久了。后来大家在讨论中认为这两种想法是不恰当的，因为他们不合于中国革命的发展和建设的需要。普选的全国人民代表大会的召开，固然还需要一个相当时间，就是在普选的全国人民代表大会召开以后，政协会议还将对中央政府的工作起协商、参谋和推动的作用。其次，新民主主义时代既有各阶级的存在，就会有各党派的存在。旧民主国家的统治者是资产阶级，其所属各派必然是互相排挤，争权夺利。新民主主义的各阶级在工人阶级领导之下，虽然各阶级的利益和意见仍有不同之处，但是在共同要求上在主要政策上是能够求得一致的，筹备会通过的共同纲领草案就是一个最明显的证明。而人民民主统一战线内部的不同要求和矛盾，在反帝反封建残余的斗争前面，是可以而且应该得到调节的。
    新民主主义的总纲问题
    周恩来接着谈到第二个问题，即新民主主义的总纲问题。他说：总纲讨论中，曾有一种意见，以为我们既然承认新民主主义是一个过渡性质的阶段，一定要向更高级的社会主义和共产主义阶段发展，因此总纲中就应该明确地把这个前途规定出来，筹备会讨论中，大家认为这个前途是肯定的，毫无疑问的，但应该经过解释、宣传、特别是实践来证明给全国人民看，只有全国人民在自己的实践中认识到这是唯一的最好的前途，才会真正承认它，并愿意全心全意为它而奋斗。所以现在暂时不写出来，不是否定它，而是更加郑重地看待它。而且这个纲领中经济的部分里面，已经规定要在实际上保证向这个前途走去。
    总纲中关于人民对国家的权利与义务有很明显的规定，有一个定义须要说明，就是“人民”与“国民”是有分别的。“人民”是指工人阶级、农民阶级、小资产阶级、民族资产阶级，以及从反动阶级觉悟过来的某些爱国民主分子。而对官僚资产阶级在其财产被没收和地主阶级在其土地被分配以后，消极的是要严厉镇压他们中间的反动活动，积极的是更多地要强迫他们劳动，使他们改造成为新人。在改变以前，他们不属人民范围，但仍然是中国的一个国民，暂时不给他们享受人民的权利，却需要使他们遵守国民的义务。这就是人民民主专政。这是对我们中华人民共和国的团结和生产有利的。
    周恩来报告至此，特别提起大家注意：这些反动阶级中的重要反动分子，决不会甘心失去他们过去的特权，一定要进行阴谋破坏的，最近杨杰将军的遇害，便是一个例证。人民的军队和警察将加强工作以防止他们的阴谋破坏。我们大家则须加强团结，提高警惕，以打击反动分子的各种阴谋。
    新民主主义的政权制度
    周恩来报告的第三个问题是新民主主义的政权制度。周恩来分析了资产阶级旧民主主义的欺骗性，指出新民主主义的政权制度是民主集中制的人民代表大会的政府，它完全不同于旧民主的议会制度，而是属于以社会主义苏联为首的代表大会制度的范畴之内的。但是也不完全同于苏联制度，苏联已经消灭了阶级，而我们则是各革命阶级的联盟。我们的这个特点，就表现在中国人民政协会议的形式上。政府各部门和现在各地的人民代表会议以及将来的人民代表大会都将同样表现这个特点。从人民选举代表、召开人民代表大会、选举人民政府、直到由人民政府在人民代表大会闭会期间行使国家政权的这一整个过程，都是行使国家政权的民主集中的过程。而行使国家政权的机关就是各级人民代表大会和各级人民政府。
    新民主主义的军事制度、经济和文化政策
    第四个问题是军事制度。人民解放军之所以能取得今天的胜利和得到全国人民的拥护，决不是偶然的。它的特点是不仅勇敢机智善于作战，而且能正确地执行政策，并帮助人民劳动。政治工作制度是它的灵魂。这种军事制度，不仅不同于封建军阀，也不同于资产阶级的军事制度。纲领上规定将以这种新民主主义的军事制度来统一全国的军队，这里边包括一切从国民党反动统治方面起义过来的军队。这种作法显然不同于军阀制度的吞并排挤，而是不分彼此帮助他们改造为人民的军队。
    第五、新民主主义的经济政策，基本精神是照顾四面八方，就是实行公私兼顾、劳资两利、城乡互助、内外交流的政策，以达到发展生产繁荣经济的目的。新民主主义五种经济的构成中，国营经济是领导的成份。在逐步地实现计划经济的要求下，使全社会都能各得其所，以收分工合作之效，这是一个艰巨而必须实现的任务。筹备期中关于经济的部分讨论最多，各方面好的意见都已经集中在草案的条文里面。经济建设是百端待举，但须有缓急轻重之分，草案中已根据那些是应该做的、那些是不应该做的；那些是现在可以做的、那些是现在不能做的；那些是已经做了的、那些是尚未做的等分析规定出具体条文。
    第六为新民主主义的文化政策，这个问题讨论不多，简单的说来，就是民族的形式，科学的内容，大众的方向。草案中规定了必须强调的几项，其他没有规定的并非不作，因为在草案第五章中已经都概括地提到了。
    新民主主义的民族和外交政策问题
    第七是新民主主义的民族政策问题。其基本精神是使中华人民共和国成为各民族友爱合作的大家庭，必须反对各民族内部的公敌和外部的帝国主义。而在各民族的大家庭中，又必须经常反对大民族主义和狭隘民族主义的倾向。各少数民族的区域自治、武装权利及其宗教信仰之被尊重均在条文中加以明确的规定。
    第八为新民主主义的外交政策问题。草案第七章中明确地规定了保障什么，拥护什么，反对什么，这就是保障本国独立、自由和领土主权的完整，拥护国际的持久和平和各国人民间的友好合作，反对帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策。在总纲上已明白地接受了毛主席在“论人民民主专政”中关于和苏联及各新民主国家站在一起的指示，大家承认：在国际和平民主阵营与帝国主义侵略阵营对垒之间是绝对没有什么中间阵营存在的。
