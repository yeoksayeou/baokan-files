　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 2nd: Moscow dispatch: Soviet coal miners have completed their previously proposed over-planned production task four months ahead of schedule. Half of the coal mine trusts in the Soviet Union have now reached the average daily output level of 1950. The miners also guarantee that all coal mining industries will reach the average daily production level of 1950 before December this year. This is the report presented in the letter from Soviet miners to Stalin, published on the front pages of Moscow newspapers on August 28.

　　The Soviet coal mining industry is developing rapidly. The Minister of the Coal Mining Industry, Zasiadko, gave a detailed account of the development and achievements of the Soviet coal mining industry in a speech at the celebration of the Soviet Miner's Day (August 26 is the Soviet Miner's Day) held at the Central Red Army Theater in Moscow on the 27th. He said: "The entire history of the development of the coal mining industry in the Soviet era is the history of the Communist Party and the Soviet government's efforts to mechanize coal production and transform the coal mining industry from the most backward sector in Tsarist Russia into an advanced industry using first-class machinery. By 1940, before the war, Soviet coal production would have increased sixfold compared to 1913. The second coal production center established in the east during the war played an important role in defeating the enemy during the Great Patriotic War. Post-war development in accordance with the Five-Year Plan has made Soviet coal production now rank first in Europe, far exceeding countries such as Britain and France. In the first seven months of this year, the entire coal mining industry completed 102 percent of its production plan."

　　The mechanization of the Soviet coal mining industry has far surpassed the pre-war level. The labor productivity of miners has increased by nearly 10 percent compared to last year. This year, the number of combined coal mining machines, coal cutting machines, and coal loading machines has tripled. Higher levels of mechanization are progressing simultaneously with the improvement of miners' cultural levels. The boundary between physical and intellectual labor in the Soviet mining industry is gradually being eliminated. The Soviet government is extremely concerned about improving the material and cultural life of miners. In 1947 and 1948, more than one billion rubles were allocated as service bonuses for miners. In the first half of this year, 950,000 square meters of housing and a large number of cultural palaces, clubs, libraries, and other cultural institutions have been built in various Soviet coal mining areas.

### 苏煤矿工人向斯大林保证提前完成超计划生产　采煤机械化与矿工文化同时猛升

　　苏煤矿工人向斯大林保证提前完成超计划生产
  　采煤机械化与矿工文化同时猛升
    【新华社北平二日电】莫斯科讯：苏联煤矿工人已提前四个月完成了他们过去所提出的超计划生产的任务，全苏现有一半煤矿托拉斯已达到一九五○年的每日平均出产水平，矿工们并保证全部煤矿工业在今年十二月以前达到一九五○年的每日平均生产水平——这是八月二十八日莫斯科各报头版所载苏联矿工给斯大林信中所提出的报告。
    苏联煤矿工业正飞跃发展中，煤矿工业部部长查夏迪科于二十七日在莫斯科中央红军剧院所举行的庆祝苏联矿工节（按八月二十六日为苏联矿工节）大会上演说，详述苏联煤矿工业的发展和成就。他说：“苏维埃时代煤矿工业发展的全部历史，就是联共党和苏联政府为煤矿生产机械化，把煤矿工业从沙俄时代最落后的部门转变到使用头等机器的先进工业的历史。到战前一九四○年，苏联煤产就将比一九一三年增加六倍。战时在东部所建立的第二个产煤中心，在伟大爱国战争中对击败敌人起了重要的作用。战后按照五年计划继续发展，使苏联煤产现已占欧洲第一位，大大超过了英、法等国。今年头七个月，整个煤矿工业完成生产计划百分之一百零二。”
    苏联煤矿工业的机械化，已大大超过战前。矿工的劳动生产率比去年增加将近百分之十。今年，联合采煤机、切煤机和装煤机的数目已增加了三倍。更高度的机械化是和矿工文化水平的提高同时并进的，苏联矿业中体力劳动和智力劳动的界限正在逐渐消除。苏联政府极为关心矿工物质与文化生活的改进。一九四七和一九四八两年中已拨了十亿以上卢布作为矿工的服务奖金。今年上半年，苏联各个煤矿区已建设了九十五万平方公尺的住屋和大量的文化宫、俱乐部、图书馆和其他文化机关。
