A Reporter's Visit to a Representative of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference
　　Deep Hatred and Ardent Love – An Interview with Farmer Representative Li Xiuzhen
    Wang Xi
    "Profound hatred for the enemy, unwavering loyalty to the people," Li Xiuzhen's life is interwoven with intense love and hate. Born into a poor tenant farmer's family, she worked as a servant for nine years. From middle age onwards, she found the Chinese Communist Party and threw herself into the great cause of women's liberation and people's liberation. She is forty-nine years old this year, her temples streaked with gray, but listening to her energetic and passionate words, I feel like she is only in her twenties.

    Speaking of the lives of women gasping for breath under feudal society, her hatred is endless: "That year, how many women did I not see with my own eyes hanging themselves, jumping into rivers, and drinking salt brine to die?" "Working as a servant for nine years was truly dark and hopeless, without a glimmer of light!" She took out the draft Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference from her drawer and pointed to Article 6, asking me to read it aloud: "The People's Republic of China abolishes the feudal system that shackles women. Women have equal rights with men in all aspects of political, economic, cultural, educational, and social life. Freedom of marriage between men and women is practiced." Having experienced the transition between the old and new eras, she is wholeheartedly delighted with this program that safeguards the interests of all the people.

    The program of victory was won through life-and-death struggles. Since joining the revolution in 1936, Li Xiuzhen has never ceased her struggle for liberation. When the Eighth Route Army launched guerrilla warfare against the Japanese invaders on the plains of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan, Li Xiuzhen was constantly responsible for secret communication and liaison work, entering and exiting the enemy's heartland, scouting the enemy's troop movements, distributing leaflets and slogans of the Eighth Route Army, and buying ammunition for the guerrillas.

    She often disguised herself as a superstitious Buddhist woman going to the City God Temple to burn incense, or carried a vegetable basket, evading the enemy's search and traveling long distances. Once, as she was walking near a highway, she saw enemy soldiers approaching her. She quickly tore up the letter, chewed it with fried dough sticks, swallowed it, and calmly escaped the enemy. She also recounted another experience of hiding a letter in her hair, wading through a large river, falling into the water seven times and climbing back up, finally delivering it safely. At that time, she told the comrades of the Eighth Route Army, "This is nothing. If we want to live a good life, we have to get up and do it!" In 1942, she sent her only son to join the army. She told me, "My son has already sacrificed himself for the people. Do I have any grief? I only know to avenge my son!"

    When the Kuomintang bandit gangs attacked her hometown in 1946, she personally witnessed the directors of the village women's salvation associations being boiled alive in pots and drowned in wells, and the militia cadres suffering brutal massacres, her fighting spirit grew stronger day by day. When she was arrested by the subordinates of Wang Sanzhu, the reactionary bandit leader, and threatened with being buried alive, she was even more stubbornly unyielding. She recalled, "They beat me with gun butts. I only felt a 'poor spirit' all over my body. My voice was louder than arguing, resisting their interrogation."

    "How many years have you been a party member, how many years have you been a cadre?" the enemy forced her to confess.

    Li Xiuzhen cleverly remained calm:

    "What do you mean by round? I have been a servant for nine years. Pears, red dates, and apples are not very round. Only the leather ball that the young master plays with is the roundest. What do you mean by 'dry wood'? I heard that the beam on the Nantian Gate is the driest. Besides that, what 'dry wood' is there?"

    The enemy found it both funny and angry, and further questioned her: "I'm asking you if you are a Communist, if your son is in the Eighth Route Army, where is he, tell the truth quickly!"

    She replied angrily, "Everyone has a son. Some sons are in the 'Central Army', some are in the Eighth Route Army. Are their parents all guilty?" When the enemy couldn't get anything out of her and took out a gun to threaten her, she shouted, "My son joined the Eighth Route Army. If his parents are guilty, kill them if you want, bury them if you want!"

    From the People's Political Consultative Conference to the prospects for the new Chinese countryside, she saw it very clearly and spoke enthusiastically.

    "We must unite four friends to overthrow three enemies. Workers and peasants must combine to develop production, and agriculture must supply more raw materials for industry." She spoke of the detours her hometown's mutual aid groups had taken and were now correcting. She said that before coming to the meeting, she was at home arranging for the development of cooperatives, drought resistance and famine preparedness, and the work of thrift and economy. Under her leadership, the local women have already begun to act as enthusiastically as the men. "With the energy we use to spin half a catty of cotton and weave fifteen feet of cloth in one night, what difficulties can't we overcome?"

    In order to undertake the arduous task of building a new China, the forty-nine-year-old woman is working hard to learn. Before the meeting, participating in the discussion of the draft program, she studied the three drafts until late every night. She deeply understands the meaning of the famous sayings "squeeze out time if there is no time" and "be honest, don't pretend to understand if you don't understand." I also asked her, "Is it still possible to learn well when you are old?" She showed the perseverance she was accustomed to when overcoming all kinds of difficulties: "It's not too late at all. When I attended the Women's Congress, I learned sixty characters. After that, I learned one character a day. That's a thousand in three years. At that time, I was only fifty-two years old. By the time I'm sixty, I'll be able to understand documents." She doesn't let go of every opportunity to learn in practical life and work. She mentioned visiting the Summer Palace, saying, "If I don't see such a place, I won't be able to tell the people in my hometown more truthfully how the feudal emperors used to exploit our blood and sweat to provide for their licentious and shameless luxurious lives."

    Chinese women have stood up. The older generation has paved the way for women's liberation in this way. Now, they still stand at the forefront, leading the women of over 200 million people forward!

　　中国人民政协代表访问记
  　深仇与热爱　访农民代表李秀真
    汪溪
    “对敌人仇深似海，对人民赤胆忠贞”，李秀真的一生，交织着强烈的爱和恨，出身于贫苦佃户的家庭，当过九年佣工。从中年后，找到了中国共产党，投身妇女解放人民解放的洪炉——他今年四十九岁了，鬓发斑白，但听她精力充沛热情奔放的言谈，我觉得她只有二十多岁。
    谈到在封建社会下喘息的妇女生活，她的仇恨说也说不完：“那一年我不亲眼看到多少女人上吊、跳河、喝盐卤死去？”“当了九年老妈子，真是天昏地暗，瞧不见一点亮儿！”她从抽屉里拿出了人民政协共同纲领草案，指着第六条，让我念下去：“中华人民共和国废除束缚妇女的封建制度。妇女在政治的经济的文化教育的社会生活各方面，均有与男子平等的权利。实行男女婚姻自由。”她经历过新旧时代的交替，她为这个维护全体人民利益的纲领衷心喜悦。
    胜利的纲领，是生死斗争换取来的——李秀真从一九三六年参加革命后，一天也没有停止过争取解放的斗争。当八路军在冀鲁豫平原上对日寇展开游击战争时，李秀真常年地担负着秘密通讯联络工作，出入于敌人的心腹地区，侦察敌寇兵力动向，散贴八路军的传单标语，替游击队收买弹药。
    她经常装扮成迷信的佛婆子上城隍庙烧香，或是挎着卖菜篮子，瞒过敌人的搜查，远途奔波。有一次，她正行在公路左近，眼见敌兵向她赶来，便连忙把信件撕碎同油条嚼在一起咽下，泰然逃脱了敌人。她又述说另一次把信件夹在头发里，涉过大水，七次倒下水里又爬起来，终于安全送达的经历。那时她对八路军的同志说：“我这不算啥，要过好日子，就得起来干！”她在一九四二年送独养儿子参军。她告诉我说：“儿子已经为人民牺牲了。我有什么悲痛么？我只知道替儿子报仇！”
    国民党匪帮在一九四六年向她的家乡进攻，她亲眼看见村妇救会主任一个一个地被煮死在锅里，被淹死在井里，民兵干部们遭受着残酷的屠杀，她的斗志则日加坚强。当她被反动派土匪头子王三祝部下逮捕，被活埋威胁着的时候，更是顽强不屈。她回忆说：“他们拿枪托捣我，我只觉满身有一股‘穷劲’，我的嗓音比吵架还响，对抗他们的审问。”
    “你是多少年的老党员，多少年的干部？”敌人逼她的口供。
    李秀真机智地不动声色：
    “你说什么是圆么？我当过九年老妈子，见到梨呀红枣苹果啊都不很圆，只有少爷玩的皮球顶圆；你问啥是‘干木’吗？我听说南天门上的过木是最干的，除去这，那还有什么‘干木’？”
    敌人好笑又气愤，再拷问她：“我问你是不是共产党，你儿子是不是八路军，在那里，快点实说！”
    她怒火冲天地答：“谁家也有儿子，儿子有当‘中央军’，有当八路军的，她爹妈都有罪么？”敌人问不出所以，掏出枪来威胁她时，她叫喊起来：“我儿子当了八路军，他爹妈要是有罪，你们想杀就杀，想埋就埋吧！”
    从人民政协谈到新中国农村的远景，她看得十分清晰，便热情洋溢地畅谈起来。
    “我们要团结四个朋友打倒三个敌人，工人和农民结合起来发展生产，农业要为工业供给更多的原料。”她谈着家乡互助组走过弯路正在纠正。她说在来参加会议前正在家布置发展合作社、抗旱备荒、节约俭用的工作，当地的妇女在她领导之下，已经同男子一样热烈地行动起来了。“凭着我们用一夜纺半斤棉花织一丈五尺布的劲儿，什么困难不能克服呢？”
    为了担负建设新中国的艰巨任务，四十九岁的老大娘正在努力学习。在会议前，参加草案的讨论中，她每天研究三个草案到夜深，她是深懂得“没有时间要挤”，“老老实实，不懂就是不懂，不要装懂”这些名言的意义的。我又试问她：“年纪大了还能学习好？”她表现出战胜千难万苦时惯有的毅力：“一点都不迟，我在开妇代大会时学会了六十个字，以后就一天学一个字，三年就是一千，那时我不过才五十二岁，到六十岁我便能看懂文件了。”她不放松每一个一个在实际生活工作中学习的机会，她提起了去参观颐和园，说：“不去看看这样的地方，我就没法更真实地告诉家乡的人，封建帝王过去是怎样吃尽我们的血汗，供他们荒淫无耻的豪华生活。”
    中国的妇女站起来了，年老的一代是这样地开辟了妇女解放的道路，现在，她们依然站在前列，率领二万万以上人口的妇女向前迈进！
