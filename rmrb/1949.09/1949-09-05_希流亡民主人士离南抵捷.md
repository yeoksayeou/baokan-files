　　Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 4th: TASS reports: It is announced here that the first transport ship carrying Greek democratic exiles from Yugoslavia has arrived at the Czechoslovakian border. The Greek Provisional Democratic Government recently requested Tito to send them to a people's democratic country. Under the pressure of international democratic public opinion and the insistence of the Greek exiles themselves, the Tito government was forced to allow them to leave the country. The 1,221 Greeks arriving in Czechoslovakia are mostly the old, weak, women, children, and the disabled. According to them, the Tito ruling clique exercised terror against them, imprisoning them in Yugoslav concentration camps, coercing them to abandon democratic ideas, and employing them as henchmen of the Ranković police apparatus.

    【新华社北平四日电】塔斯社布拉格讯：据此间宣布，第一艘载运南斯拉夫境内的希腊流亡民主人士之运输船已抵达捷克斯洛伐克边境。希腊临时民主政府最近要求铁托遣送他们到一个人民民主国家。铁托政府在国际民主舆论的压力下和希腊流亡民主人士们自己的坚持下，被迫允准他们离境。来捷的一千二百二十一个希腊人大都为老弱妇孺和残废者。据他们说：铁托统治集团对他们行使恐怖，把他们监禁在南斯拉夫集中营内，胁迫他们放弃民主观念，并充任兰科维奇警察机关的走卒。
