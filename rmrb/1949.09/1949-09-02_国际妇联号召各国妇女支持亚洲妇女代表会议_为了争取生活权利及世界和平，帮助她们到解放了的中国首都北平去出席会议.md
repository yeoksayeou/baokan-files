Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 1st—The International Democratic Women's Federation issued a letter to women, calling on women of all countries to support the upcoming Asian Women's Representative Conference. The full text is as follows:

　　Dear Sisters! Asian Women! Women of all countries!

　　We are very pleased to announce that the Asian Women's Representative Conference will be held in Beiping—the liberated capital of China—from December 1st to 7th, 1949.

　　In Asia, for many centuries, millions of women have lived like slaves, suffering from hunger and cold, and overwhelmed by hard labor from birth to death. Infectious diseases and famines periodically cause the death of one-nineteenth of the population. Few women see their children grow to adulthood.

　　And now, for the first time in Asian history, women will be able to gather together to conduct a common struggle, to fight for the right to live like human beings, for the happiness of their children, for the right of self-determination of all nations, and for world peace.

　　Women of Asian countries, you who are suffering and are engaged in the struggle for a happy life, you who are engaged in armed struggle because you are unwilling to be slaves any longer, regardless of your political or religious beliefs, please send your representatives to the Asian Women's Representative Conference to report your sufferings, your struggles, and your aspirations. In an atmosphere of exchanging experiences, mutual understanding, and international friendship, you will find new strength to continue the fight.

　　We know that there will be many difficulties in holding this conference, but in order to defend the lives of your children, concentrate all your strength to overcome these difficulties.

　　Women of America! Women of Britain! Women of France and Holland! You must also send your representatives to the conference. Your governments' oppression of the people of Asian countries makes it necessary for you to give Asian women all possible assistance. In the battle against imperialism, they are fighting to save the lives of their children, but they are also helping to save the lives of your children. A third world war is being manufactured through the Pacific Pact (a replica of the Atlantic Pact).

　　The people of Asian countries are defending world peace by waging a struggle for their national independence and democracy.

　　Women of all countries! Our Asian sisters, like all other women, are moving towards a future of freedom, peace, and happiness. We must wholeheartedly support them in order for the conference to be a success. Publicize the conference, raise funds for it, and help them send representatives to this epoch-making conference of Asian countries.

　　The Asian Women's Representative Conference must and will be a great success!

　　　　　　　　　　　　International Democratic Women's Federation, August 19, Prague

　　国际妇联号召各国妇女支持亚洲妇女代表会议
  　为了争取生活权利及世界和平，帮助她们到解放了的中国首都北平去出席会议
    【新华社布拉格一日电】国际民主妇联发表告妇女书，号召各国妇女支持即将到来的亚洲妇女代表会议，全文如下：
    亲爱的姐妹们！亚洲妇女们！世界各国的妇女们！
    我们怀着非常愉快的心情宣布，亚洲妇女代表会议将于一九四九年十二月一日至七日在北平——解放了的中国的首都举行。
    在亚洲，许多世纪以来，成千成万的妇女象奴隶一样生活着，饥寒交迫，从生到死都给苦役压得透不过气来。传染病和饥馑周期地使人口十九天亡。妇女很少能看到她们的孩子长大成人。
    而现在，在亚洲历史上还是第一次妇女将能够聚会在一起，进行共同的斗争，为争取过人的生活的权利，为她们孩子的幸福，为各民族的自决权，为世界和平而斗争。
    亚洲各国的妇女们，你们正在受痛苦和正在进行争取幸福生活的斗争，你们正在进行武装斗争，因为你们都不愿意再做奴隶，不论你们的政治或宗教信仰，请派你们的代表出席亚洲妇女代表会议，来报告你们的痛苦，你们的斗争和你们的愿望。在交流经验，互相了解和国际友爱的气氛中，你们将找到新的力量继续战斗下去。
    我们知道，要进行这次会议将面临许多困难，但是，为了保卫你们孩子的生命，集中你们一切的力量来克服困难吧。
    美国妇女们！英国妇女们！法国和荷兰的妇女们！你们也必须派遣你们的代表参加会议。你们的政府对亚洲各国人民的压迫，使你们必须给予亚洲妇女以一切可能的援助。在反对帝国主义的战斗中，她们是为拯救她们孩子的生命而战斗，但她们也从而帮助拯救你们孩子的生命。第三次世界大战正在经由太平洋公约（大西洋公约的翻版）制造着。
    亚洲各国的人民正以进行争取其民族独立和民主的斗争，保卫着世界和平。
    各国妇女们！我们的亚洲姊妹们，其他所有的妇女也一样，要举步走向自由、和平与幸福的将来。我们必须全心全意支持她们，以期会议成功。为会议进行宣传，为它募集基金，以帮助她们遣派代表参加这一亚洲各国划时代的会议。
    亚洲妇女代表会议必须而且一定将获得巨大的成功！
    　　　　　　　　　　　　国际民主妇女联盟　八月十九日于布拉格
