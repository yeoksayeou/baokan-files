Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 5th—According to TASS, Budapest: Bao Eison, Chairman of the World Federation of Democratic Youth (WFDY), delivered a report at the World Youth Congress on the 12th regarding the activities of the WFDY since the First World Youth Congress, and the tasks of the WFDY in the struggle for peace, democracy, national independence, and a better future for youth.

Bao Eison stated: Our Congress opens immediately after the World Youth Festival hosted by the WFDY and the International Student Union. The achievements of the festival once again prove that our alliance can unite youth and guide them in the struggle for a better future.

To illustrate the growing prestige of the WFDY, it suffices to mention that during the course of this Congress, dozens of organizations have been admitted to the Federation, bringing our membership to sixty million young men and women in over seventy countries; whereas at the London Congress in 1945, our total force was only thirty million.

Bao Eison recalled the oath taken at the First World Youth Congress: "We pledge to eliminate all traces of fascism from the face of the earth; to fight for the establishment of genuine friendship among all nations; we pledge to fight for the consolidation of lasting peace, the abolition of exploitation and poverty, and to ensure work for all. We are gathered here to consolidate the unity of all youth, to mourn our fallen comrades, and to vow that the capable hands, wise minds, and enthusiasm of youth will no longer be destroyed in war. Forward, forward for our future!" We can be proud that, four years later, we remain true to this oath. It is this oath, these goals, that unite tens of millions of young men and women around the world within the Federation.

He detailed the Federation's activities over the past four years. During this period, youth delegations visited different countries around the world. Those who visited the Soviet Union were able to directly understand the immense and unparalleled contribution of the socialist country to the common victory. The Soviet people are building their country to be more prosperous and beautiful. Young people who visited the People's Democratic countries also saw a youth with a better future. Speaking of the Federation's struggle to protect the interests of youth in colonial and dependent countries, he pointed to the achievements of the Southeast Asian Youth Conference convened in Calcutta in February 1948, in cooperation with the WFDY and the International Student Union.

Bao Eison's report emphasized:
	Expanding the Propaganda of Soviet Achievements Strengthens the Confidence of Youth Worldwide

Bao Eison emphasized: This conference demonstrated the solidarity of youth worldwide who are prepared to fight against imperialism. Bao declared: The WFDY has taken action to protect the youth of colonial and dependent countries. In early 1945, the WFDY had only about three million members in North Africa and the Middle East. Today, the number of members there exceeds ten million.

Next, Bao discussed the WFDY's struggle against the imperialist policies of war and poverty. The enemies of peace and democracy have done everything possible to undermine the unity of the WFDY, but these attempts have completely failed. Bao emphasized: Our alliance must point out to young people where the real enemy is, must tirelessly teach young people confidence in victory, broaden the horizons of young people, and explain that the struggles they are engaged in daily are linked to the worldwide democratic struggle. Imperialists have nothing to offer young people except poverty, unemployment, and oppression. They try to corrupt the morals of young people, spread sentiments of doubt, and undermine young people's confidence in their own strength. They use the most shameless methods to arouse base instincts. Our alliance must actively participate in exposing the shameless acts of harmful propaganda. Therefore, the Federation must increasingly expand the propaganda of the achievements won by the Soviet Union, because their achievements not only unfold a brilliant and bright future for Soviet youth, but also ignite hope in the hearts of youth around the world.

Bao continued: Our alliance must resolutely lead youth forward along the path of democracy, the only path that can build a happy life. Young people will not be intimidated by obstacles. Young people, closely gathering their ranks, can overcome these obstacles. There is no victory without struggle, and young people must fight because they want to win.

At this Congress, we must issue a slogan to the youth of all countries, calling on young people worldwide to unite in the ranks of the WFDY, to unite and strive for decisive victory!

When the report of the leading organs of the World Federation of Democratic Youth was adopted, the entire hall erupted in a storm of applause.

　　世界青年沿着民主道路前进
  　青联会员增达六千万
    鲍埃逊在世界青年代表大会报告
    【新华社北平五日电】据塔斯社布达佩斯讯：世界民主青年联盟主席鲍埃逊，十二日在世界青年代表大会会议上，作了关于第一次世界青年代表大会以来世界青联的活动，以及青联在争取和平、民主、各民族独立和青年更美好的将来的斗争中的任务的报告。
    鲍埃逊称：我们的代表大会，是紧接着世界民主青联和世界学联所主持的世界青年联欢大会之后开幕的。联欢大会的成就，再一次证明，我们的联盟能够团结青年，把他们引导到争取美好的将来的斗争中。
    要说明世界民主青联声望的增长，只要提到这一点就够了，即在这次代表大会工作的过程中，已通过数十个团体加入联盟，这样就使得我们的会员达到七十多个国家的六千万青年男女；而在一九四五年的伦敦代表大会时，我们的队伍的总数只有三千万。
    鲍埃逊追述了第一次世界青年代表大会所作的誓言：“我们立誓要从地面上消除一切法西斯主义的痕迹；为建立全世界各民族间真正友谊而斗争；我们立誓要为争取巩固与持久的和平、废除剥削与贫困、保证人人都有工作而斗争。我们聚集在这里以巩固全体青年的团结，悼念倒下的同志，并立誓要使青年的能干的双手、明智的思想和热情，不再被毁灭于战争中。前进，为我们的将来而前进！”我们能引为骄傲的，就是在四年后的今天，我们依然忠于这一誓言。正是这一誓言，这些目的，把全世界数千万男女青年团结在联盟的周围。
    他详述了联盟在过去四年中的活动。在这一时期中，各个青年代表团访问了世界上的不同的国家，那些访问了苏联的代表团，能够直接地了解社会主义国家对共同的胜利所作的巨大的无比的贡献。苏联人民正在把他们的国家建设得更繁荣更美丽。访问了人民民主国家的青年们也看到了有着更美好的将来的青年。谈到联盟所进行的保卫殖民地和附属国青年利益的斗争，他指出在世界民主青联与世界学联合作下，于一九四八年二月在加尔各答召集的东南亚青年代表会议的成就。
    鲍埃逊报告中强调指出
    扩大宣传苏联的成就坚定全世界青年信心
    鲍埃逊强调地说：这次会议显示了准备为反帝而斗争的全世界青年的团结一致。鲍氏宣称：世界青联已经采取了保卫殖民地和附属国青年的行动，一九四五年初，世界青联在北非和中东各国家里只有约三百万会员。而今天那里的会员数已超过了一千万。
    接着鲍氏谈论了世界民主青年反对帝国主义的战争和贫困政策的斗争。和平与民主的敌人竭尽一切努力破坏世界青联的团结，但是，这些企图，结果已完全失败。鲍氏强调称：我们的联盟必须向青年指出真正的敌人在那里，必须孜孜不倦地教导青年对胜利的信心，扩大青年人民的眼界，并且说明他们日常进行着的斗争，是和全世界民主斗争联系着的。帝国主义者，除了给予青年以贫困、失业和压迫之外，不会有任何东西。他们试图使青年的道德败坏，散布疑惑的情绪，破坏青年对自己力量的信心。他们用最无耻的办法来激起低级的本能。而我们的联盟必须积极地参与揭露进行有害宣传的无耻勾当。因此，联盟必须日益扩大地宣传苏联所赢得的成就，因为他们的成就不仅仅是向苏联青年展开了灿烂光明的前途，而且使全世界青年的心也燃烧起希望。
    鲍氏继称：我们的联盟必须坚决地领导青年沿着民主的道路前进，沿着这个唯一可能建设幸福生活的道路前进。青年是不会被障碍所吓倒的。青年紧密地集结着自己的队伍，能够克服这些障碍。没有斗争就没有胜利，青年们要斗争，因为他们要胜利。
    在这次大会上，我们必须向各国青年发出口号，号召全世界青年团结在世界青联的队伍里，团结起来，争取决定性的胜利！
    在通过世界民主青年联盟领导机关的报告时，全场响起暴风雨般的鼓掌。
