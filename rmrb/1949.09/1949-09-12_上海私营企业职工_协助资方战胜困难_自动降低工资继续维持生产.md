　　Shanghai Private Enterprise Workers
　  Assist Capitalists in Overcoming Difficulties
　  Voluntarily Reducing Wages to Maintain Production
    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 11th - Reporter Ji Xiying reports: In the current serious struggle to crush the enemy's blockade, workers in many Shanghai private enterprises are implementing a policy of benefiting both labor and capital, and are taking various measures to help capitalists overcome difficulties. Many workers, considering that the blockade of Haikou has led to slow product sales and the relatively difficult capital turnover for capitalists, have voluntarily reduced wages and benefits to maintain the continued production of factories. The more than 1,000 workers at the Xinguang Underwear Factory, which has always woven high-end underwear, have voluntarily reduced their original wage calculation method of one yuan base salary equivalent to four liters of white rice to one yuan base salary equivalent to two real savings units. They also agreed that wages could be issued in installments flexibly according to the factory's economic situation, so that capitalists would have room for maneuver in using funds. All the workers of Datong Weaving and Dyeing Factory agreed that those with a base salary of 30 yuan or less would still be paid according to the original salary, while those with a base salary of more than 30 yuan would have their wages discounted according to the original base salary, with the discount rate increasing proportionally with the base salary. In order to take care of the workers' minimum living standards, the capitalists also agreed to guarantee 24 days of work per month, with wages halved for the remaining six days of downtime, and rice subsidies issued as usual. The famous Meiren Silk Weaving Factory is currently facing slow sales of silk quilt covers. The capitalists proposed changing to weaving No. 6 Ge to meet market needs. Although the wages for weaving No. 6 Ge are lower than those for weaving quilt covers, the workers gladly agreed in order to ensure that the factory could continue to operate. The workers of Zhonghua Iron Factory use the method of depositing a portion of their wages in the factory according to salary level to help capital turnover and assist capitalists in overcoming difficulties. Workers and staff in Shanghai's private enterprises are also helping capitalists overcome various difficulties by increasing production, practicing economy, and actively providing capitalists with opinions on improving business management. For example, after the workers of Xingya Steel Factory were entrusted by the Heavy Industry Department to manufacture 120,000 railway spikes, everyone worked day and night to rush the project, and as a result, the goods were delivered three days ahead of the original schedule. Under the leadership of the trade union, the workers of Zhenxing Wool Weaving Factory vigorously practiced economy, saving 10% of wool and yarn every day, while the quality of the products remained the same as before. In order to thank the workers, the capitalists of the factory specially allocated a portion of funds to set up a small library to facilitate workers' learning. Hongzhang Yarn Factory, which has a considerable position in the private textile industry, planned to suspend production for three months to wait for the economic situation to improve due to lack of raw materials and slow sales of finished products. After discussion, the Hongzhang Trade Union believed that suspension of production was not a solution, and expressed to the capitalists its willingness to assist in overcoming difficulties, and pointed out many shortcomings of the capitalists in business operations and management, hoping for rapid and effective adjustments. At the same time, it also suggested to the capitalists to recall the funds that had been hidden during the rule of the Kuomintang bandit gang to maintain production. The staff who used to eat relatively well also agreed to reduce the food standards to save the factory's expenses. Under the influence of the workers' enthusiastic help, the capitalists of Hongzhang abandoned the negative idea of closing down and suspending production, and decided to continue production.
    Since the liberation, the famous Shanghai Wing On, Sincere, The Sun, and Lane Crawford department stores have experienced sluggish business and insufficient income due to the reduced sales of high-end goods and poor business management. In order to improve the company's business, under the leadership of the trade union, the workers have established business meetings with the capitalists to assist the capitalists in changing business policies and management methods. The workers of Sincere Company suggested to the capitalists to quickly sell off high-end goods and replace them with daily necessities needed by the vast majority of citizens. The workers of Wing On Company suggested to the capitalists to cut redundant staff and save many unnecessary expenses. Because the workers actively produced and took the initiative to help the capitalists come up with ideas and find ways to overcome difficulties, the business situation of major companies has gradually improved. For example, the recent daily sales figures of Sincere Company have been around 10 million yuan.
    Because Shanghai private enterprise workers have been subjected to political persecution and economic oppression for a long time, at the beginning of liberation, some workers inevitably had some overzealous actions in demanding that capitalists improve their treatment and allow them to resume work. However, under the correct leadership of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, after universal political study, the workers' awareness has been greatly improved. Although some leftist sentiments among some workers have not been completely eliminated, the vast majority of workers have deeply realized that only by implementing Chairman Mao's correct policy of benefiting both labor and capital can the current and long-term interests of the working class be met. As for the capitalists of Shanghai's private enterprises, some have also recognized the position and role of the working class in the production industry, and are willing to listen to the opinions of the workers and work together to overcome temporary difficulties. However, there are also some capitalists who are hesitating and watching in the face of difficulties. This kind of passive and wrong thinking needs to be quickly overcome by the capitalists.

　　上海私营企业职工
　  协助资方战胜困难
　  自动降低工资继续维持生产
    【新华社上海十一日电】记者计惜英报道：上海许多私营企业的职工，在当前粉碎敌人封锁的严重斗争中，执行劳资两利政策，采取各种办法协助资方克服困难。许多职工以海口被封锁，产品滞销，资方资金周转比较困难，自动降低工资和待遇，以维持工厂继续生产。过去向来织造高级内衣的新光内衣厂的千余职工自动把原来一元底薪折合白米四升的计薪办法减为一元底薪折合两个折实储蓄单位。他们并答应工资可按照厂中经济情况机动地分期发放，以便资方在运用资金时有周转回旋的余地。大统织染厂全体职工同意，凡底薪在三十元以内者仍按原薪发放，在三十元以上者，则按照原来底薪折扣发放工资，折扣率按底薪比例递增。资方为顾全工人最低限度的生活，也答应保证每月开工二十四天，其余六天停工期间工资减半，米贴照发。著名的美人织绸厂目前由于丝制被面销路不畅，资方提出改织六号葛以适应市场需要，虽然织六号葛的工资比织被面少，但工人为顾全工厂能继续开工，便欣然答应。中华铁工厂职工则用按照薪资等级，分别存储一部分工资于工厂的办法，来帮助资金周转，协助资方渡过困难。上海私营企业中的工人、职员并以增产、节约，积极地向资方提供关于改进经营管理的意见等办法来协助资方克服各种困难。例如兴亚钢业厂的工人们在得到重工业处委托制造十二万只道钉之后，大家日夜赶工突击，结果较原定计划提前三天缴货。振兴毛织厂的工人们在职工会领导之下厉行节约，每天可节省羊毛和毛纱百分之十，而产品的质量仍和从前相等。该厂资方为了酬谢工人，特拨出一部分款项，设立小型图书室，便利职工学习。在私营纺织业中颇有地位的鸿章纱厂，资方以原料缺乏，成品滞销，计划停工三月，以待经济情势好转。鸿章工会经研讨后，认为停工决不是办法，当向资方表示愿意协助克服困难，并指出资方在经营业务和管理方面的许多缺点，希望作迅速有效的调整，同时又向资方建议调回过去在国民党匪帮统治时期隐避的资金来维持生产。原来伙食吃得比较好的职员们亦同意减低伙食标准，节省厂方的开支。在职工这种热诚帮助的影响下，鸿章资方打消了关厂停工的消极想法，决继续开工生产。
    著名的上海永安、新新、大新、先施等各大百货公司解放以来，由于高贵货品的销路减少，加上业务经营不善，以致生意清淡入不敷出。职工们为改进公司业务，在工会领导之下与资方分别建立了劳资双方的业务会议，协助资方改变业务方针和经营方法。新新公司的职工向资方建议迅速脱售高贵货品，调换绝大多数市民需要的日用百货。永安公司的职工则向资方建议裁撤冗员，节省许多不必要的开支。由于职工们积极生产并主动地协助资方出主意、想办法克服困难，因之各大公司的业务情况已逐步好转。如新新公司最近每天营业数字均在人民币一千万元左右。
    上海私营企业职工因为过去长期受到政治迫害和经济压榨，所以在解放之初，一部分工人在要求资方改善待遇和准许复工方面，曾不免有些过激的行动。但是在中共市委会和上海总工会筹备会的正确领导下，经过普遍的政治学习之后，工人们的觉悟已大为提高。尽管某些工人中间的某些左倾的情绪尚未完全消除，但绝大多数的工人们都已深刻地体验到只有执行毛主席指示的劳资两利的正确方针，才符合工人阶级的目前和长远的利益。至于上海私营企业的资本家，有些人也已经认识了工人阶级在生产事业中所处的地位和所起的作用，愿意听取职工的意见，共同努力来战胜暂时的困难。但也还有一些资本家却在困难面前徘徊观望，犹豫不前。这种消极的错误的想法是亟需资方加以迅速克服的。
