The usage method is as follows: (1) When the light is red – all vehicles must stop, except for vehicles turning right. (2) When the light is green – vehicles going straight or turning may proceed, but vehicles turning left must make a large detour (if limited by terrain or other circumstances, the traffic police may direct a small detour).

(4) When a yellow light is used after a green light – vehicles that have entered the stop line should accelerate, and vehicles further away should prepare to stop.

Article 5: Fast vehicles (including automobiles and motorcycles) must use the fast lane. On roads without separate fast and slow lanes, they should travel on the right side of the center line of the road. Slow vehicles (vehicles other than automobiles and motorcycles) must use the slow lane. On roads without separate fast and slow lanes, they should travel on the right side of the road.

Article 6: Vehicles must be equipped with horns. When driving at night, lights must be lit (animal-powered vehicles are exempt from installing horns).

Vehicles on side roads should yield to vehicles on main roads. Slower vehicles should yield to faster vehicles. Empty vehicles should yield to loaded vehicles. If encountered on a narrow road or at a place with obstacles, the vehicle on the wider side should stop or reverse to allow the other vehicle to pass.

Article 9: All vehicles, except for fire trucks, ambulances, police vehicles, and engineering rescue vehicles that have urgent missions and have priority passage, other vehicles must proceed in order and must not overtake arbitrarily. However, this does not apply if the vehicle in front voluntarily yields and signals the vehicle behind to proceed.

If a breakdown occurs en route and the vehicle cannot proceed, it should be immediately pushed to the side of the road or a quiet place and must not be left in place for a long time or repaired there, so as not to obstruct traffic. When tram parts are damaged, they should be repaired quickly or returned to the factory for repair to avoid obstructing traffic.

Article 19: When traffic police use hand signals to direct traffic, they should use them clearly according to the situation at the time and must not hesitate or be ambiguous. However, if drivers have doubts about the instructions, they should stop or slow down immediately and must not pass rashly to avoid danger.
