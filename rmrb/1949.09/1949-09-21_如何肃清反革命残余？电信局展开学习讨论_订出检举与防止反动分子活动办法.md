　　How to Purge Counter-Revolutionary Remnants?
  　Telecommunications Bureau Launches Study and Discussion
    Formulates Methods for Reporting and Preventing Activities of Reactionary Elements
    [This City News] Since the 16th of this month, all staff and workers of the Telecommunications General Bureau and the Beiping Telecommunications Bureau have launched a study and discussion on how to purge counter-revolutionary elements. Up to now, all units have studied the Xinhua News Agency's short commentaries "Eliminate Complacency and Extinguish Special Agent Bandits" and "Protect the Property of the People's Motherland," as well as the trade union's call to "Unite and Consolidate Revolutionary Order," and discussed issues such as the recognition of the hidden enemies' conspiracies and destructive activities, and opinions on how to deal with reactionary party members, members of reactionary groups, and special agents who have registered or refuse to register in their respective departments. This study and discussion was initiated by the administration and the trade union, with the cooperation of the Party, government, trade union, and the Communist Youth League. On the 14th of this month, a staff and workers' meeting of two thousand people was held to arrange this study and discussion, making it the central task of the bureau at present. On the 15th, a meeting of responsible administrative and trade union cadres was held, deciding that responsible personnel at all levels should be responsible for promoting this work at their respective levels. After study and discussion, the staff and workers have enhanced their vigilance, strengthened their sense of responsibility for protecting state property, and formulated methods for reporting and preventing the activities of reactionary elements, expressing their willingness to assist the government in reporting counter-revolutionary special agents. The various units of the Telecommunications Bureau are still in the midst of heated study and discussion.
