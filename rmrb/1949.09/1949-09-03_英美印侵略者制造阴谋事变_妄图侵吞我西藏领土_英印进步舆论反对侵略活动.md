Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 2nd: According to reports from Lhasa and other places: American and British imperialism and its running dog, the Nehru government of India, are creating conspiratorial incidents in Tibet, attempting to annex this vast territory of China. On July 8th, the Tibetan authorities in Lhasa, instigated by foreign aggressors, suddenly cut off telegraphic communications between Lhasa and the outside world, announced that "Communist elements are carrying out disruptive activities," notified personnel of the Kuomintang's Tibetan Office to withdraw within a limited time, completely closed the Han Chinese school in Lhasa, and expelled Han Chinese living in Tibet, not even sparing Han Chinese lamas in monasteries. On July 24th, the Nehru government of India, using the pretext of "investigating the rebellion," dispatched Daya, the administrative commissioner of Sikkim (i.e., Zhe Mengxiong), to Lhasa. Nehru also indicated that he would soon visit Sikkim and Tibet. By July 27th, the Indian News Agency, the official news agency of the Indian government, suddenly denied that there was a "rebellion" in Tibet, and blatantly revealed the ambition of the Anglo-Indian aggressors to annex Tibet. The agency claimed: "Due to the recent developments in China's situation, the Tibetan authorities are deeply concerned that the establishment of the Kuomintang office in Lhasa will lead to the intrusion of Communist activities into Tibet, so they have requested the Chinese (Kuomintang) Tibetan office to withdraw from Lhasa." It also openly stated: "Tibet has never recognized China's suzerainty, which has often caused disputes between the two countries." On the same day, "British authoritative figures" in London also told a United Press reporter, falsely claiming: "Britain has never recognized China's assertion that Tibet is part of China and is under Chinese rule." Furthermore, they said: "If China attempts to impose its rule on Tibet, Tibet can... seek British intervention." Britain has always had a Commercial Commissioner's Office in Tibet, covering up its conspiratorial activities to invade Tibet. After India's "independence," this Commercial Commissioner's Office was nominally taken over by the Indian government, but the person in charge of the Commercial Commissioner's Office was still staffed by the original British government personnel.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 2nd: The British and Indian reactionaries' conspiracy to annex Tibet has been opposed by the people of Britain and India. The British Daily Worker published a report by the newspaper's diplomatic correspondent on July 30th, stating: The Indian government has dispatched a special official to Tibet, ostensibly to investigate the situation of the Tibetan "rebellion." The Daily Worker's diplomatic correspondent commented: "With the disintegration of the Kuomintang, various conspiracies are underway to hinder the liberation of various parts of China. In Inner Mongolia and Tibet, some people are attempting to establish nominally 'independent' and 'anti-Kuomintang' regimes, with the sole purpose of preventing or delaying the liberation of these non-Han ethnic groups. The Nehru government recently controlled the princely states of Sikkim (i.e., Zhe Mengxiong) and Bhutan on the India-Tibet border. The government's current dispatch of a mission to Tibet is an attempt to extend its control even further. This is part of the Nehru government's attempt to make itself the leading 'anti-communist' country in Asia." The newspaper pointed out: "The Chinese Communist Party advocates the fullest autonomy for China's non-Han ethnic groups, but it opposes imperialist conspiracies to separate these ethnic groups from China."

TASS Delhi, 2nd: The "Lightning" newspaper wrote in an editorial entitled "The Legend of the Independence of Indian Foreign Policy is Bankrupt": Britain and the United States have turned India into a tool to realize their ambitions in Tibet, and their conspiracy shows how "independent" Nehru's foreign policy is. The Tibetan "riots" instigated by Britain and the United States were first labeled as "Communist riots," and later as "anti-communist riots." The newspaper pointed out that, in reality, it was a conspiracy by Britain and the United States. The "Lightning" newspaper claimed that, with the help of India, Britain and the United States were attempting to make Tibet subordinate to them. The newspaper reported that the Indian embassy in Lhasa is headed by a Briton, Richardson. The newspaper said that this was an amazing thing.

　　英美印侵略者制造阴谋事变
  　妄图侵吞我西藏领土
  　英印进步舆论反对侵略活动
    【新华社北平二日电】据拉萨等地消息：美英帝国主义及其走狗印度尼赫鲁政府正在西藏制造阴谋事变，妄图侵吞中国的这一块广大的领土。七月八日，拉萨的西藏当局在外国侵略者的策动下，突然截断拉萨与外界的电讯联络，宣布“共产党分子有捣乱行动”，通知国民党驻西藏办事处人员限期撤离，将拉萨的汉人学校完全封闭，并驱逐住在西藏的汉人，连寺院中的汉人喇嘛亦无幸免。七月二十四日，印度尼赫鲁政府即以“考察叛乱”为理由，派遣锡金（即哲孟雄）行政专员达雅赴拉萨，尼赫鲁亦表示不久将访问锡金及西藏。至七月二十七日印度政府机关通讯社印度新闻社发表的消息中，忽然又否认西藏有“叛乱”事件，并露骨地透露英印侵略者吞并西藏的野心。该社称：“由于中国最近局势的发展，西藏当局深恐因国民党在拉萨设立办事处，而引起共产党的活动侵入西藏，故请中国（国民党）驻藏办事处撤离拉萨。”并公然地说：“西藏从未承认中国的宗主权，为此曾时常引起两国间的纠纷。”在同一天，伦敦的“英国权威人士”也向合众社记者发表谈话，妄称：“英国从未承认中国所说的西藏是中国的一部分并受中国统辖的讲法。”并且说：“如果中国有强加其统治于西藏的企图，西藏即可……觅取英国的干涉。”英国在西藏一直设有商务专员处，掩护进行侵略西藏的阴谋活动。印度“独立”后，这个商务专员处名义上即由印度政府接收，但商务专员处的负责人仍由原英政府人员担任。
    【新华社北平二日电】英国和印度的反动派阴谋侵吞西藏，已遭到英、印人民的反对。英国工人日报于七月三十日发表该报外交访员报道称：印度政府已派遣一名特别官员到西藏去，名义上是去调查西藏“叛乱”的情况。工人日报外交访员评称：“随着国民党的瓦解，各种阴谋正在进行着以阻滞中国各个部分的解放。在内蒙古和西藏，有人正企图建立名义上‘独立’的和‘反国民党’的政权，目的只是为了阻止或延缓这些非汉族民族的解放。尼赫鲁政府最近控制了印度——西藏边界上的土邦锡金（按即哲孟雄）和不丹。该政府目前派使团到西藏去乃是一种将其控制权扩展到更远的地方的企图。这是尼赫鲁政府使自己成为亚洲首要‘反共’国家的图谋的一部分。”该报指出：“中国共产党主张中国非汉族民族的最充分的自治，但是它反对使这些民族与中国脱离的帝国主义阴谋。”
    另据塔斯社德里二日电：“闪电”报在题为“印度外交政策独立的传奇破产了”的社论中写道：英美已把印度变成实现它们对西藏的野心的工具，它们的阴谋表明尼赫鲁外交政策是怎样地“独立”。由英美煽动的西藏“暴动”首先被指为是“共产党的暴动”，后来又被称为是“反共暴动”。该报指出，然而实际上，它是英美的阴谋。“闪电”报称，在印度协助之下，英美企图使西藏隶属于英美。该报报道印度驻拉萨的公使馆是由英国人里查逊领导。该报称，这是件令人惊异的事。
