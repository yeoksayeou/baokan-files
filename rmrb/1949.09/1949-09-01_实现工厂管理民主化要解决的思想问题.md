　　Ideological Problems to be Solved in Realizing Democratic Factory Management
　　Dai Xinmin
　　The North China Ordnance Conference in January of last year proposed the establishment of an organization to realize democratic factory management – the Factory Management Committee. Subsequently, the North China Industrial and Commercial Conference and the National Labor Congress repeatedly raised this issue. This year, the New China News Agency also broadcast the Northeast Daily's editorial on the democratization of enterprise management. … In particular, this North China Workers' Congress has emphasized this issue even more. However, even after the conclusion of the North China Workers' Congress, some comrades still have difficulty understanding this issue; naturally, it is difficult to earnestly realize democratic factory management. Why do these comrades find it so difficult to understand this issue? What concerns do they have? How can these concerns be resolved? These are indeed important questions to study and resolve in order to realize democratic factory management.

　　These comrades have raised the following concerns:

　　(1) We represent all the people of China in managing the factories, and we must be absolutely responsible for the factories. Uneducated workers are only selfish and want to increase wages and benefits. What if they find out that the factory is making money and make excessive demands?

　　(2) To be responsible to all the people, we must do a good job in production; to do a good job in production, we must improve the organization and discipline of the workers. Can democratic management improve organization and discipline? Some even believe that if the "managing" personnel are not strict enough, and do not slam the table, get angry, or punish workers when they neglect discipline, then discipline will be difficult to maintain. They think that letting everyone express their opinions will lead to an unimaginable situation.

　　(3) How many complete opinions can workers offer? At most, they can offer some scattered ideas. They have no experience in managing factories. What is the point of talking about democratic management? Isn't it just a formality? Sometimes, the correct opinions are not passed by everyone. If we follow everyone's opinions, who is responsible if things go wrong? If we don't follow everyone's opinions, it's undemocratic.

　　(4) "Party newspapers use a great deal of space to publicize the consciousness of the workers, obliterating the organizational role of all the new and old cadres." The Northeast Daily editorial said: "First of all, we must rely on the workers… first of all, the workers who have been working for a long time…" All of these are detrimental to the unity of the staff and workers.

　　What are the ideological roots of these concerns? The basic problem is of course that the idea of relying on the proletariat is too vague, and the understanding of the mass line is too poor. Specifically, the following issues have not been clarified:

　　I. There is only a conceptual understanding that the Communist Party is a proletarian party. When it comes to the proletariat being the leading class, it becomes blurred to the point of thinking, "During the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan and the nearly three-year War of Liberation, wasn't it mainly靠靠靠靠the support of the peasants? They paid military grain, became soldiers… How can the proletariat lead?" They know that it is the Communist Party that leads, but they are vague about whose party the Communist Party is, and even more vague about who the basic ranks of the proletariat are. They demand that staff and workers be relied upon equally; some even demand that staff be treated leniently and workers strictly, and disagree with "蔺子安 being dismissed for extravagance." They do not know that the reason for relying on the workers is that the workers have strong organization and discipline, and that the most important characteristic of the workers is that they have been subjected to three layers of oppression and exploitation, have no private property, and live entirely by selling their labor, and therefore are "most thoroughly revolutionary," but instead discard this understanding. As a result, they are disgusted and unwilling to rely on workers when they see workers neglecting organization and discipline. The reason for making revolution is also blurred. These comrades seem not to be unaware of these simple revolutionary principles in theory, but because their position is still very unstable, they are overwhelmed by individual heroism when they are related to specific problems, such as saying: "I personally am not from the working class, so '捧' the working class like this… I personally am a cadre, a staff member, so '求全责备' cadres and staff like this…" What if the workers rise up and become too disrespectful to cadres and staff? Yes, a worker representative at the staff and worker representatives' meeting of the Beijing Tram Company proposed disagreeing with putting the character for "staff" above the character for "worker," mainly because they were too dissatisfied with the staff. However, two worker representatives in the same group then expressed different opinions: "In the past, many staff members oppressed the workers too much, but the situation will be different in the future. Aren't there already staff members who respect the workers now? Aren't our activists among the workers going to be promoted to staff members?" The next day, the representative who made the proposal made a self-criticism. This shows that the workers understand that staff members are a class of the working class, and they do not necessarily oppose staff members who do not oppress the workers too much, and they will respect staff members who respect the workers. This is fundamentally a bourgeois ideology that puts oneself in opposition to the working class and puts staff members in opposition to the working class. To solve this ideological problem, this opposition must be eliminated. Our regime is a people's democratic regime led by the proletariat, therefore the factory director and factory leaders appointed by the state are representatives of the regime led by the proletariat, and he himself is also a member of the proletariat. As long as one stands in the ranks of the proletariat, rather than standing on the heads of the workers; as long as the staff members eliminate the superiority of intellectuals and the superiority of staff members, the above-mentioned opposing ideas will naturally be eliminated.

　　II. Some comrades do not understand the backwardness shown by the workers due to years of cruel oppression, and therefore not only do not give them any sympathy, but complain and cite it as a basis for not being able to rely on them. Some comrades are so frightened by being questioned that they dare not speak, or they have to follow the leadership and say things they disagree with, and blame them with "If it is the truth, what is there to be afraid of saying?" Some comrades get so angry that they slam the table and scold "bullshit" when workers hide their mistakes, which are not really that big, for fear of losing their jobs… even to the point of dismissal. On the one hand, they do not regard the workers as masters; but on the other hand, they demand that they be even more active than they are for their own production. They only blame the workers for being selfish, backward, not understanding the revolution enough, and being slow to accept education… and do not understand Lenin's words: "... a part of the petty bourgeoisie and backward workers must participate in the socialist revolution (if they do not participate, then the struggle of the masses is impossible, and any revolution is impossible), and at the same time must bring their prejudices, reactionary fantasies, weaknesses and errors into this movement." As long as there are classes, and as long as the proletarian society has not been completely consolidated and fully developed on its own foundation, there will inevitably be representatives who do not think and are not capable of thinking. If this were not the case, then capitalism would not be the capitalism that oppresses the masses." "The entire task of the Communists is to be good at persuading the backward masses, to be good at working among the backward masses, and not to come up with some naive left-wing slogans to separate themselves from the masses." To rely on the working class, it is necessary to carry out vigorous publicity, organization, and appropriate improvements in life, and it is necessary to first believe that the working class is a class that can do great things, and should be let go to think about things, do things, be masters… give them the opportunity to exercise. The recent staff and worker representatives' meeting of the Beijing Tram Company has told us that as long as all the situations are told to the workers and they are allowed to consider the overall problems, they will not only pay attention to wages and welfare (the agenda procedure researched by the staff and worker representatives was: first, personnel issues, because the old institutions have not been moved, everyone has particularly many opinions on personnel issues; second, the issue of democratic management; and finally, the issue of wages and welfare). Seventy-two percent of their opinions are constructive. Regarding the company's production issues, a large part of them are problems that the leadership did not think of. Regarding the issue of strengthening organization and discipline, they have put forward many specific opinions. We should recognize that when workers become masters, they will also be responsible for their own production. Their sense of responsibility for their own cause will not be less than the revolutionary cadres who have been "managing the factory on behalf of all the people of China" for ten years, because they all have a very important factor, that is, that cause is their rice bowl. (During the first liberation of Zhangjiakou, many workers fought to protect the factory. At that time, I did not understand why the workers automatically protected the factory without our work. Later, I realized in my work that it was a matter of the workers' lifeline; they would rise up even if they were not mobilized.) They are the people who love industry the most in the whole country, and they are also the people who understand and care about the development of industrial production the most in the whole country. When they really regard the factory as their own factory, there is no need to slam the table, no need to get angry… there will be no problem with organization and discipline, and it can all be established. (Because they have all pinned their future and their hopes on this cause.) The violation of discipline by a few will not be tolerated by the majority; the majority's sanctions against the minority will have a greater effect than the "managing" personnel slamming the table and getting angry. Factories that have been liberated for a slightly longer period of time should understand this principle by comparing the discipline before and after liberation. This is by no means a subjective idea, and backwardness can only be overcome in this process.

　　III. The masses are made up of many people, and the power of the masses is also the power made up of many people. The wisdom of the masses is also made up of the partial things of many people. Three cobblers make a Zhuge Liang, but that doesn't mean that every cobbler is a Zhuge Liang; moreover, isn't Zhuge Liang's divine calculation based on the reconnaissance work of many people? An engineer recalled after understanding the mass line after liberation: "In the past, the inventions were not all started by the workers, and we learned more, so when we improved it, it became our own invention." It is not necessary to say that it is difficult for workers to put forward complete opinions, and it is feared that complete opinions are rarely from one person's brain. The problem lies in being good at collecting the fragmentary things scattered among the masses and refining them into complete things. (When collecting, it is also necessary to pay attention not to obliterate the contributions of those who put forward any fragmentary opinions, so as to inspire and encourage the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses.) Therefore, as long as democratic management of factories is not intentionally made a formality: such as not notifying the content of the meeting in advance, and discussing it when everyone is together; not letting the workers know the overall things of the factory, so that the workers have no way to consider the problems; the leader's usual work style is not democratic, and the workers dare not speak in front of them, etc., it will never be just a formality. Although the things seen by everyone from many aspects are many partial things, they will come together to form a correct and comprehensive thing.

　　IV. Putting the leadership and the mass line in opposition, only knowing how to give tasks to the masses, not understanding how to inspire the consciousness of the masses, and appropriately waiting for the awakening of the masses, thinking that those who oppose coercion are abandoning the leadership and following the tail, only thinking that it is more efficient to do things immediately and that it is too troublesome to consult with the masses is a chronic disease; not understanding that tasks that are not passed by the masses, the enthusiasm cannot be inspired, and the execution is reluctant, the efficiency is even less to be talked about, and sometimes it will simply be put aside, that is what becomes a chronic disease! After returning from preparing for war last year, Shimen Daxing Yarn Factory made a plan to increase production and compensate for losses, one of the biggest projects to increase production was to drive fast, and it was implemented without consulting with the workers. The workers did not agree to drive fast, and as a result, wasn't it still not possible to implement it? It was still that yarn factory, because the female workers liked to be beautiful and often went to the tea stove to look in the mirror and comb their hair, which affected production. A notice prohibiting it was put up next to the tea stove without mobilization, but it did not work. Later, didn't it first convince the party members and League members and let them take the lead in persuading and influencing other female workers, before it was solved? It should be recognized that the mass line is the main symbol that distinguishes us from other political parties. Our correct slogans all coincide with the interests of the people, especially the working class, and are all able to persuade the masses and mobilize the masses to actively implement them. Only when the masses consciously rise up and actively implement the tasks can the work efficiency be truly improved. Therefore, the mass line can only strengthen the leadership, and it is not opposed to the leadership. Appropriately waiting for the masses to awaken (the "appropriate" is mainly for the problems of the majority) cannot be interpreted as tailism. Tailism lags behind the degree of awakening of the masses. Of course, the masses of a factory will see a smaller side, and it may be more difficult to persuade them sometimes, and it cannot be demanded that only the majority should understand the ideas before implementing them. Therefore, in addition to determining a democratic management, a final decision-making power of the factory director was also determined. However, while implementing the final decision-making power of the factory director, it is necessary to immediately report to the higher authorities for instructions, and at the same time carefully study why the majority disagrees (whether it is not correct) and how to persuade the majority. This situation must be regarded as an abnormal situation, and it must be grasped and resolved.

　　To better realize democratic factory management, of course, the first thing is for these comrades to raise their awareness and examine and solve their own ideological problems. However, it is not very simple, because there is a question of position involved in these ideological problems, the roots are quite deep and quite hidden, and it is very difficult to examine them. For example, a comrade once said when mobilizing workers to study, "Study hard, otherwise what is the use of being a worker for the rest of your life?" This comrade would not accept it if you usually said that he despised labor and despised workers, because he knows a lot about theory, but he inadvertently revealed it like this. Of course, comrades with such views will have many opportunities to expose themselves in their work if they pay close attention; but it is definitely not a short period of time that can examine and solve all these ideological problems. Therefore, it is also a very subjective idea to wait until the ideological problems are completely solved before realizing democratic factory management; at the same time, it should not affect the mobilization of hundreds, thousands, or even tens of thousands of staff and workers because a few factory leaders cannot understand the ideas; that is, it will affect the development of the work of a production department. Therefore, it is necessary to solve the ideological problems of these comrades on the one hand (the ideological problems must also be solved; otherwise, there will be many problems if they reluctantly obey the organization and implement the decisions). At the same time, these comrades must obey the organization and earnestly implement the decisions of the North China Workers' Congress. There are already facts showing that in the implementation process, the actual situation will improve these comrades and help these comrades solve their ideological problems. Many comrades who participated in the staff and worker representatives' meeting of the Beijing Tram Company have solved many of their own vague understandings after the meeting. (Most of the concerns about realizing democratic factory management mentioned above were solved at that meeting.) In the process of implementing the resolutions of the Workers' Congress, these comrades especially need to go deep into the workers, understand the emotions, demands, and opinions of the workers… The workers will help these comrades solve many ideological problems.

　　实现工厂管理民主化要解决的思想问题
    戴新民
    这是去年一月华北兵工会议，即提出了要建立实现工厂管理民主化的组织——工厂管理委员会。接着去年的华北工商会议、全国劳动代表大会，又一再的提出这一问题。今年新华总社还广播了东北日报关于企业管理民主化的社论。………特别是这次华北工代会议，则更加强调的提出这一问题。但一直到华北工代会议结束之后，还会有些同志想不通这一问题；当然也就很难认真的来实现工厂管理民主化。为什么这些同志如此难于想通这一问题，他们都有那些顾虑，要怎样才能解决？的确是为了实现工厂管理民主化，要很好的研究与解决的问题。
    这些同志曾提出以下顾虑：
    （１）我们是代表全中国人民来管理工厂的，我们要对工厂绝对负责。没有教育好的工人，只有自私自利，希望提高工资，增加福利，工厂赚了钱，要是他们知道了，提出过高的要求。怎么办呢？
    （２）为了对全体人民负责，必须搞好生产；要搞好生产，必须提高工人群众的组织性纪律性。实现民主管理，还能提高组织性纪律性吗？甚至认为“管”工人员态度不严，遇到工人忽视纪律的情形，不拍桌子，不发脾气，不处罚，……纪律即很难维持，再放手叫大家提意见，情况简直不可想象。
    （３）工人能提出多少完整的意见？顶多提一些零零星星的东西。过去没有管理过工厂，没有管理工厂的经验，讲什么民主管理，还不是摆一摆形式？有时明明是正确的意见，但大家都通不过，按大家的意见吧，闹坏了谁负责？不按大家的意见，又是不民主。
    （４）“党报用绝大篇幅宣传工人群众的自觉性，抹掉其中一切新老干部的组织作用”，东北日报社论称：首先要依靠工人群众，……首先是长期劳动的工人……这些都是不利于职工团结的。
    发生这些顾虑的思想根源是什么呢？基本问题当然是依靠无产阶级的思想太模糊，对群众路线了解太差，具体分析起来，主要是下面一些问题没闹清楚：
    一、对共产党是无产阶级政党，只是概念的了解。谈起无产阶级是领导阶级，就会模糊到“八年抗日战争，将近三年的解放战争，主要的不是靠农民支持吗？他们纳军粮，当兵……怎么是无产阶级领导的呢？”倒也知道是共产党领导的，但共产党是谁的党则模糊了，谁是无产阶级的基本队伍则更加模糊了。他们会要求一视同仁的来依靠职员与工人；甚至要求对职员要宽，对工人要严，会不同意“蔺子安只铺张了一下就撤职”。他们不知道所以要依靠工人群众，是因为工人群众组织性纪律性强，把工人群众最主要的特点受过三层压迫和剥削，毫无私有财产全靠出卖劳动力而生活，因而“最富于革命的彻底性”的认识，反而丢开了。以致一见到工人稍有忽视组织纪律的情形，即深恶痛绝的，不想依靠了；为什么要闹革命当然也就弄模糊了。这些同志在理论上好象倒不会不知道这些简单的革命道理，但因立场还非常不稳，一联系到具体问题，便被个人英雄主义冲昏头脑，如说：我个人并不是工人阶级出身，对工人阶级这样“捧”，……我个人是个干部，是个职员，对干部，对职员这样“求全责备”……工人起来，对干部对职员即太不尊重怎么办？是的，北平电车公司职工代表会上曾有一个工人代表提出不同意把职字放在工字上面，主要的是对职员太不满。但是接着即有两个与之同组的工人代表提出不同的意见：“过去是很多职员欺压工人太甚，今后情形即不同了，现在不是已经有尊重工人的职员吗？咱们工人中的积极分子不也要提成职员吗？”第二天提意见的代表本人又做了检讨，这说明工人了解职员是工人阶级的一个阶层，对欺压工人不太厉害的职员都并不一定那样反对，对尊重工人的职员，他们会很尊重的。这是在思想上把自己与工人阶级对立起来，把职员与工人阶级对立起来，基本上是一种资产阶级的思想。解决这一思想问题，必须消灭这种对立。我们的政权是无产阶级领导的人民民主政权，因此国家委派的厂长及工厂负责人，是无产阶级领导的政权的代表人，他本身也是无产阶级。只要自己站在无产阶级的队伍中，而不是站在工人头上；只要职员把知识分子的优越感，职员的优越感扫除掉，以上的对立思想自然就消除了。
    二、有的同志对工人群众因受多年的残酷压迫，而表现出来的落后，是理解不到的，因而不但不予以丝毫同情，反而抱怨，反而引为无法依靠的根据。有的同志对一被追问即吓得不敢讲话了，或只好顺着领导上讲自己不同意的话，都会责备以“要是真理，有什么不敢讲的？”有的同志对因怕丢饭碗而隐瞒自己一件并没有什么了不起的错误的工人会气得拍桌子，骂放屁，……以致开除。他们一方面并不把工人当主人翁来看；可是另一方面又要求比为自己生产还积极。对工人的自私，落后，对革命认识不够，接受教育慢……都只有责备，不懂得列宁的话：“……一部分小资产阶级及落后的工人必然要参加社会主义革命，（如果他们不参加，那么群众的斗争是不可能的，任何革命都是不可能的。）同时必然把他们的偏见，反动的幻想，弱点和错误带进这运动中来”。只要有阶级存在，只要无产阶级社会还没有在本身的基础上完全巩固充分发展起来，将来也必然有不去思想和没有思想能力的代表，假如不是这样，那么资本主义便不是压迫群众的资本主义了。”“共产党人的全部任务就是善于说服落后群众，善于在落后群众中进行工作，而不是想出一些幼稚的左的口号来把自己与群众隔开。”不了解要依靠工人阶级还必须用大力来进行宣传组织以及适当的改善生活的工作，还必须首先相信工人阶级是能做大事情的阶级，应当放手让他们去想事，做事，当主人，…给他们锻练的机会，最近北平电车公司职工代表会议已告诉了我们，只要把所有的情况都告诉给工人，放手让他们去考虑全面问题，他们并不是只注意工资与福利问题，（该职工代表所研究出来的议事程序是：第一人事问题，因旧机构未动，大家对人事问题意见特别多；第二管理民主化问题；最后才是工资与福利问题。）他们提的意见有百分之七十二是带有建设性的。关于公司生产的问题。而其中很大一部分是领导上没想到的问题，关于加强组织性纪律性的问题，他们曾提出很多具体意见，我们应当认识工人当起主人来，他们也就要对自己的生产事业负责任了，他们对他们自己事业的责任心并不会小于“代表全中国人民来管理工厂”的十来年的革命干部，因为他们都还有很要紧的一个因素，即那个事业是他们的饭碗。（张家口第一次解放即有许多工人奋死护厂。我当时不了解为什么没有咱们的工作，工人即自动护起厂来，后来工作中才了解到那是个有关工人命根子问题；不发动也会起来的。）他们是全国人民中最爱护工业的人，又是全国人民中最了解与最关心发展工业生产的人，在他们把工厂真的看成是自己的工厂的时候，不用拍桌子，不用发脾气，……组织性纪律性，没有问题，都可以建立起来。（因为他们只有把他们的前途、他们的希望都寄托到这个事业上。）少数人的违犯纪律，也会不容于多数人的；多数人对少数人的制裁，比“管”工人员的拍桌子，发脾气，作用都会大。解放时间稍长一点的工厂，只要把解放前后的纪律拿来比一比，都应当了解这一道理。这绝不是主观想出来的，落后也只有在这中间来克服。
    三、群众是很多人凑起来的，群众的力量也就是很多人凑成的力量，群众的智慧也是许多人的片面的东西凑成的。三个臭皮匠凑成一个诸葛亮，并不等于每个臭皮匠都是一个诸葛亮；况且诸葛亮的神算，又何尝不是靠许多人的侦察工作呢？一个工程师在解放后，理解了一下群众路线，回忆着说：“过去的发明还不都是先由工人提一个头，我们学的东西多，一提高，即成了自己的发明。”不必说工人很难提出完整的意见，恐怕完整的意见很少是出于一个人的脑筋。问题在善于汇集散在群众中的片断的东西，精制成完整的东西。（在汇集时还必须注意不能抹杀提出任何片断意见者的功劳，才会启发与鼓励群众的积极性与创造性。）所以民主管理工厂只要不是有意的作成形式：如事先不通知会议内容，凑到一起即讨论；工厂全面东西不叫工人知道，工人无从考虑问题；领导人平时作风不民主，工人当面不敢讲话等，绝不会只是个形式。大家从多方面看来的东西，虽然是许多片面，但是会凑成一个正确的全面的东西的。
    四、把领导和群众路线对立起来，只知道给群众提任务，不懂得启发群众觉悟，与适当的等候群众的觉悟，认为反对强迫命令的都是放弃领导的尾巴主义，只觉得想干马上即干工作效率高，和群众商量就太麻烦就是慢性病；不了解群众通不过的任务，积极性启发不起来，免强执行，效率更谈不到，甚至有时会干脆搁置起来，那才成了慢性病呢！石门大兴纱厂去年备战回来，做了一个增产补损计划，其中有很大一个增产项目是开快车，没有和工人商量即执行，工人都不同意开快车，结果，还不是执行不通吗？也还是那个纱厂，因女工好漂亮时常到茶炉去照镜子梳洗，影响生产，没有动员即在茶炉旁出了一个禁止的通知，结果不起作用，后来还不是先说通了党员团员由他们带头说服影响其他女工，才算解决了问题吗？应当认识群众路线是我们区别于其他政党的主要标帜。我们的正确口号都与人民群众利益相吻合，特别是工人阶级，都是能说服群众，发动群众积极执行的。也只有群众自觉的起来，积极执行任务工作效率才能真的提高。所以群众路线只能加强领导，与领导并不是对立的。适当的等待（“适当的”主要的是大多数的问题）群众觉悟，也并不能即解释成尾巴主义，尾巴主义是落后于群众的觉悟程度。当然一个工厂的群众是会看得面小一些，有时也会比较难说服，倒也不能要求只有大多数搞通思想才执行。所以在确定了一个民主管理之外，又确定了一个厂长最后决定权。不过一面执行厂长最后决定权，另一面又必须立即报告上级请求指示，同时还要仔细研究为什么大多数不同意（是否并不正确）与如何说服大多数，必须把这一情况看成是一个不正常的情况，一定要抓紧解决。
    要更好的实现工厂管理民主化，当然首先是要这些同志提高认识，检查与解决自己的这些思想问题。不过很不简单，因为这些思想问题中都有一个立场问题搅在里面，根都相当深，又相当隐蔽，检查起来很费劲，如某同志曾经在动员工人学习时讲“要好好学习，否则当一辈子工人有什么用啊？”这个同志平常要说他轻视劳动，轻视工人，他是不会接受的；因为他理论的东西知道得很不少，只是无意中这样暴露了一下。当然有这样一些观点的同志，在工作中仔细注意，暴露的机会就不会少；不过也绝不是一个短时期可以把这些东西都检查出来并且解决思想问题的。所以等待思想问题完全解决之后，再来实现工厂管理民主化，也是个很主观的想法；同时也不应当为了少数工厂领导干部打不通思想而影响着几百几千以致几万职工的发动；也就是影响一个生产部门工作的开展。因而必须一方面解决这些同志的思想问题（思想问题也一定要解决；否则，勉强服从组织，执行决定，问题也会很多。）同时一定要这些同志服从组织，认真的执行华北工代会的决定。已经有事实说明，在执行中，实际情况会提高这些同志，帮助这些同志解决其思想问题的，很多参加北平电车公司职工代表会议的同志，会后都解决了不少自己的模糊认识。（上面提到的实现工厂管理民主化的顾虑，大半在那个会上解决了。）在执行工代会决议中，特别需要这些同志多深入工人群众，了解工人群众的情绪、要求、意见……工人群众会帮助这些同志解决许多思想问题的。
