　　配合人民首都建设指导窑业计划生产
  　工商局召开窑业生产座谈会
    【本市讯】工商局为指导本市窑业进行有计划的生产，于昨（五）日上午召开窑业生产座谈会，出席者除各公私营窑场代表十八人外，并有建设局及西郊工程处代表参加。首由工商局陈纪科长说明开会意义在于了解本市砖瓦的供求状况，以便订出指导生产的计划。继由西郊工程处王处长、彭副处长分别说明今后北平市的建筑，依照都市计划委员会的规定，都要走上标准化，所以，砖瓦的质量和规格也应特别注意。最后决议：关于生产情况，由各窑场分别报告窑业公会；关于需要情况，公家建筑部分由西郊工业处等有关单位负责统计，私人建筑部分由建设局根据以往平均数字估计，然后再由工商局召集会议，作更进一步的商讨与确定；至于提高质量，确定规格等问题，也将在以后逐步研究解决。
