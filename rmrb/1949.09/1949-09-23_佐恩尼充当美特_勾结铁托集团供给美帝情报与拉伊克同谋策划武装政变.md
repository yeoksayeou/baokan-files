Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 22nd: The Hungarian People's Court continues to try the treason case, according to TASS, Budapest. On the 19th, it tried Tibor Zorn, former member of the Hungarian National Assembly, former Minister of Personnel of the Hungarian Communist Party, and spy for the U.S. intelligence agency, the Strategic Services Unit.

Zorn pleaded guilty to all the charges against him in the indictment, saying: All the accusations against him are correct. According to Zorn, in the autumn of 1944, he lived in Switzerland as a political exile. The European branch of the U.S. Strategic Services Unit was also located in Switzerland, and its head, Dulles, was openly the official of the U.S. Embassy in Bern. At that time, the situation of the Soviet army liberating Eastern Europe was very clear, and Dulles's task was to establish espionage organizations in Eastern European countries. One of Dulles's assistants was Feld, who was the official representative of the Unitarian Service Committee (note: an international church organization - editor) in Europe. They hired spies by providing political exiles with material assistance, with the help of the Yugoslav Consul in Switzerland, Lomba, and the Yugoslav Consul in Marseille, Latinovic (both of whom were American spies). Zorn at that time led a group of Hungarian political exiles, including some politically unstable students and intellectuals, whom Zorn educated in the spirit of chauvinism and nationalism. Lomba and Zorn maintained close contact with Vági, providing them with reading materials that promoted the American Browder theory. Zorn and these people agreed with these theories and decided to win Hungary over to the American side. After learning of this, Lomba proposed to Zorn in September 1944 to establish contact with Dulles. At that time, Zorn already knew that Lomba and Feld were recruiting spies among exiles in Czechoslovakia, Germany, Poland, and other countries. Zorn and Vági drafted a memorandum stating their understanding of the European political situation and their plan to cooperate with the United States in the future. After Lomba presented this memorandum to the Americans, Dulles met with Zorn. In November 1944, Zorn was formally employed to serve the U.S. intelligence agency.

Dulles told Zorn that the failure of fascism would lead to the rise to power of communist parties in Western European countries, so subversive activities must be carried out within these parties. Zorn fully agreed with this view, but Dulles still showed Zorn the receipt for the money he received from Feld. They agreed that Zorn would use the alias "Peter" after returning to his country, and Dulles would use the alias "Wagner" to maintain contact. Zorn confessed that he knew from Vági and Lomba, and was convinced that there was already a secret contact between Tito and Dulles in 1944; and negotiations were held for post-war activities against the Soviet Union.

Zorn confessed that in 1944, Dulles ordered him and Vági to return to Hungary. Feld gave them 4,000 Swiss francs and arranged for them to cross the Swiss border into France with forged documents from Yugoslav agencies. They met Latinovic in Marseille, obtained new documents, and then the U.S. military authorities sent them to Belgrade by military plane. Yugoslav officials escorted them back to Hungary and instructed them to burn the forged documents after crossing the border, which they did. Zorn said: All the American and Yugoslav officials he came into contact with on his way to Hungary knew that he was an American spy, and it was obvious that they were all people who cooperated closely with the American spy agency. It was difficult for me to determine where the boundary between the American spy agency and the Yugoslav spy agency actually lay.

Zorn confessed that Dulles ordered them to infiltrate the ranks of the Communist Party, climb to high positions, promote pro-American propaganda, and win over as many high-ranking officials as possible. They sent reports to the U.S. intelligence agency through three channels: first, through Zzimil and others in Yugoslavia; second, to Ferdi in Switzerland, and then from Ferdi to Feld and Dulles; third, by submitting written reports to Switzerland, from "Peter" to "Wagner." In Budapest, Zorn contacted Zzimil through Kálmán. After Zorn successfully occupied an important position in the party, he placed spies in important positions. He placed Vági in the press office of the Prime Minister's office, Kálmán in the Ministry of Social Welfare, Dimitér as the manager of the "Danube" joint-stock company, Balaban in the Radio Committee, Ferdi in the "Maszovol" joint-stock company, and so on. They held meetings every two months, and usually pretended to work actively, cautiously conducting anti-communist leadership propaganda. Zorn continued to place American spies who arrived in Hungary one after another, such as Szász, and helped Koisza establish a branch of the Unitarian Service Committee that covered up American organizations.

In 1946, Dulles instructed Zorn to contact Rajk. The instruction was brought by Bartók, an American spy working in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. After that, Zorn and Rajk maintained contact until May 1944, during which Rajk directed Zorn's activities.

Zorn confessed that they had long begun preparing for an armed coup in Hungary. During the Nagy era, they had been trying to remove the Communist representatives from the government. By 1947-1948, the situation had changed. The democratic forces had become stronger, and the strength of the working class had been consolidated. This meant that only a violent coup could be considered, and Rajk agreed to do so. In January 1948, Rajk told Zorn in detail about Rajk's talks with Rankovic, and told him about Tito's plan to establish a Balkan state group headed by Yugoslavia and anti-Soviet, with the aim of overthrowing the governments of people's democratic countries and establishing bourgeois regimes. The threads of the treasonous conspiracy were all concentrated in Rajk's hands. In April or May of the same year, Rajk instructed Zorn to prepare to convene a party congress after the coup. Rajk said that it was necessary to arrange for only those who agreed to give legal force to the coup to participate. Zorn also knew about the plan to assassinate Rákosi, Farkas, and Gerő, and knew that the Yugoslavs would provide assistance. Zorn said: The date of the coup would depend on Rankovic and the U.S. intelligence agency, because this date was related to the international situation. The authors of the armed coup plan were the U.S. intelligence agency and Tito, Rankovic, and others.

Zorn confessed that the armed coup in Hungary was only part of the overall American-Yugoslav plan to establish a Balkan state group headed by Yugoslavia. Zorn also knew that Rankovic had told Rajk about provocative acts aimed at Soviet diplomatic personnel in Belgrade. Zorn said: The coup relied on the support of the army and special police detachments guaranteed by Báárfy. Rajk placed reliable people in the Ministry of the Interior and disbanded the party organizations in the police. They used every means to win over young people in the People's University, build up Rajk's reputation, and seek the support of rich peasants, nationalists, and chauvinists. They also received the support of the Yugoslav army and terrorist actions. After the coup, the Hungarian government would accommodate those who participated in the conspiracy and those who sympathized with their policies, with Rajk as Prime Minister. Hungary would receive American economic and financial assistance and join the United Nations. Zorn said: After the coup, the Hungarian political system would be transformed in imitation of the Yugoslav system. They would reduce the Communist Party to an unimportant position and put the People's Front in the first place. They would fill the People's Front with rich peasants and petty bourgeois elements. In the economic field, they would abolish all the achievements of Hungarian democracy, return factories, manufacturing plants, mines, and banks to their original owners, abolish land reform, and return land to landlords. In foreign policy, they would act cautiously and gradually try to separate Hungary from the peace camp and drag Hungary into the American camp. He said: We were forced to act cautiously because we knew that the Hungarian people had deep feelings for the Soviet Union, so even American financial assistance would not be given openly at first, so as not to arouse the resentment of the Hungarian people.

The chief magistrate showed Zorn pictures of Dulles and Feld in court, and Zorn immediately recognized who Dulles and Feld were, just as Rajk immediately recognized Rankovic's picture.

Zorn admitted that he obtained monetary rewards from Feld for engaging in espionage activities. He also said: Among the foreign forces they were preparing to rely on was the Zionist organization. A group of Zorn's people joined the organization, and they also cooperated closely with the U.S. intelligence agency. Zorn finally confessed that the U.S. intelligence agency had also established an espionage organization in Czechoslovakia.

The court's trial of Zorn ended here.

　　佐恩尼充当美特
    勾结铁托集团供给美帝情报与拉伊克同谋策划武装政变
    【新华社北平二十二日电】据塔斯社布达佩斯讯：匈牙利人民法庭继续审判叛国案。十九日审讯匈前国民议会议员、匈共前人事部长、美国谍报机关战略服务处的间谍提波尔·佐恩尼。
    佐恩尼对起诉书中控告他的一切罪状服罪，并且说：对他的一切控告都是正确的。据佐恩尼供称：一九四四年秋，他作为一个政治流亡者侨居瑞士，美国战略服务处欧洲分处也设在瑞士，其首领杜勒斯的公开身份是美国驻伯尔尼公使馆的官员。那时苏军解放东欧的形势已很明显，杜勒斯的任务便是在东欧国家建立间谍组织。杜勒斯的助手之一是费尔德，他是一神教务委员会（按为国际教会组织——编者）在欧洲的正式代表。他们通过给政治流亡者以物质帮助的方法，雇用间谍，并由南斯拉夫驻瑞士领事洛姆巴和南斯拉夫驻马赛领事拉蒂诺维奇（二人都是美国间谍）帮助进行工作。佐恩尼当时领导了一批匈籍政治流亡者，包括若干政治上不稳定的学生和知识分子，佐恩尼以沙文主义和民族主义的精神教育他们。洛姆巴和佐恩尼与瓦基保持密切联系，供给他们以宣传美国白劳德理论的读物，佐恩尼这些人赞成这些理论，决定把匈牙利争取到美国方面来。洛姆巴得悉后，即于一九四四年九月提议佐恩尼和杜勒斯建立联系，那时佐恩尼已知道洛姆巴和费尔德正在捷、德、波等国的流亡者中招雇间谍，佐恩尼便和瓦基起草一项备忘录，申述他们对欧洲政治情势的认识和将来同美国合作的计划。洛姆巴把这备忘录呈递给美国人后，杜勒斯即与佐恩尼会晤。一九四四年十一月，佐恩尼正式受雇为美国谍报机关服务。
    杜勒斯告诉佐恩尼：法西斯主义的失败将招致西欧各国共产党的当权，所以必须在这些党内进行颠覆性的活动。佐恩尼完全同意这个意见，但杜勒斯仍把佐恩尼从费尔德处领取金钱的收据拿给他看。他们约定佐恩尼回国后用“彼德”的化名，杜勒斯用“华格纳”的化名以保持联系。佐恩尼供称：他从瓦基和洛姆巴那里知道，并且深信在一九四四年铁托与杜勒斯之间已有秘密联系；并举行对抗苏联的战后活动合作的谈判。
    佐恩尼供称：一九四四年杜勒斯命令他和瓦基等回匈牙利，费尔德给他们四千瑞士法郎，并给他们布置用南斯拉夫机关的伪造文件越过了瑞士边境到法国，他们在马赛见到了拉蒂诺维奇，获得了新的文件，然后美国军事当局用军用机送他们到贝尔格莱德，南斯拉夫的官员护送他们回到匈牙利，并嘱咐他们过境后即烧掉伪造文件，他们照办了。佐恩尼说：在他赴匈牙利的途中所接触的一切美国和南斯拉夫的官员，都知道他是美国间谍，很明显地他们都是与美国间谍机关密切合作的人，我很难确定美国间谍机关和南斯拉夫间谍机关的分界究竟在那里。
    佐恩尼供称：杜勒斯命令他们打入共产党的队伍，并爬上高位，作亲美的宣传并争取尽可能多的高级官员。他们用三条途径向美国谍报机关送呈报告：第一是通过南斯拉夫的兹齐米尔等人；第二是送给瑞士的费尔迪，再由费尔迪送给费尔德和杜勒斯；第三是递交书面报告到瑞士，由“彼德”给“华格纳”。在布达佩斯，佐恩尼通过卡尔曼与兹齐米尔联系。佐恩尼成功地盘据党的重要地位之后，即安插间谍人员到重要职位上，他安插瓦基到总理办公室新闻处，卡尔曼到社会福利部，迪米特尔担任“多瑙河”股份公司的经理，巴拉班到无线电委员会，费尔迪在“马苏伏尔”股份公司等等。他们每两个月举行一次会议，平时则假装积极工作，审慎地进行反共产党领导的宣传。佐恩尼继续安插陆续到匈的美国间谍萨兹等，并帮助科伊萨建立了掩护美国组织的一神教务委员会分会。
    一九四六，杜勒斯训令佐恩尼和拉伊克联系，训令是在外交部工作的美国间谍巴尔托克带来的，以后，佐恩尼和拉伊克一直保持联系到一九四四年五月，这期间拉伊克指挥佐恩尼的活动。
    佐恩尼供称：他们早就开始准备在匈牙利举行武装政变。在奈基时代，他们一直努力把政府里的共产党代表撤掉。到一九四七至一九四八年，情况已改变了，民主的力量强大了，工人阶级力量巩固了，这就只有考虑武力的政变，拉伊克同意这样做。一九四八年一月，拉伊克详细告诉佐恩尼关于拉伊克和兰科维奇的会谈，并告诉他铁托准备建立以南斯拉夫为首并反苏联的巴尔干国家集团的计划，其目的是推翻人民民主国家的政府，建立资产阶级的政权。叛国阴谋的线索都集中在拉伊克手里。同年四月或五月，拉伊克训令佐恩尼准备召集政变后召开的党代表会议，拉伊克说必须布置只让那些同意予政变以法律力量的人来参加。佐恩尼也已知道了刺杀拉科西、法卡斯和格罗的计划，并知道南斯拉夫人将给予援助。佐恩尼说：政变的日期要取决于兰科维奇和美国谍报机关，因为这日期和国际形势有关，武装政变计划的作者则是美国谍报机关和铁托、兰科维奇等人。
    佐恩尼供称：在匈牙利进行武装政变，仅是建立以南斯拉夫为首的巴尔干国家集团的美国——南斯拉夫总计划的一部分。佐恩尼并知道兰科维奇曾告诉拉伊克关于旨在反对苏联驻贝尔格莱德的外交人员的挑拨行为。佐恩尼说：政变依靠由巴尔费所保证的军队和特别警察支队的支持。拉伊克在内政部安插了可靠的人，并解散了警察中的党的组织，他们用一切方法在人民大学中争取青年，树立拉伊克的声望，并寻求富农、民族主义和沙文主义分子的支持。他们还得到南斯拉夫军队和恐怖行动的支持。政变之后，匈政府将容纳参与谋叛和同情他们政策的人，而以拉伊克为总理，匈牙利将得到美国的经济和财政援助，并加入联合国。佐恩尼说：政变之后，匈牙利政治制度将要仿效南斯拉夫的制度加以改造，他们要把共产党降到不重要的地位，而把人民阵线放在头等地位。他们将使人民阵线中充满富农和小资产阶级分子。在经济方面，他们将取消匈牙利民主的一切成就，把工厂、制造厂、矿山和银行交还原主，取消土地改革，把土地交还地主。在外交政策上，他们要审慎行动，逐渐设法使匈牙利脱离和平阵营；并把匈牙利拖到美国阵营去。他说；我们之所以被迫要小心翼翼地作，是因为我们深知匈牙利人民对苏联有深厚的感情，因此连美国的财政援助最初也不公开给予，以免引起匈牙利人民的反感。
    首席推事在堂上给佐恩尼看杜勒斯和费尔德的照片，佐恩尼立刻就认出来谁是杜勒斯和费尔德，正象拉伊克立刻认出兰科维奇的照片来一样。
    佐恩尼供认：他从费尔德取得从事间谍活动的金钱报酬。并称：他们准备依靠的外国力量中，有犹太复国主义者的组织，佐恩尼的一批人是加入该组织的，他们也和美国间谍机关密切合作。佐恩尼最后供出：美国谍报机关在捷克斯洛伐克也建立了间谍组织。
    法庭对佐恩尼的审讯至此结束。
