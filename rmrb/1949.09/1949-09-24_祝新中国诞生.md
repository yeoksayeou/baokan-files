　　Congratulating the Birth of New China
  　Tang Lan, Professor, Peking University
    The opening of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference not only unveils the newest page in Chinese history, but also in the history of the world. The old China was already heading towards destruction. Our 475 million people, with heads held high, have been waiting for a long time. The birth of the new China is the common aspiration of the people and the victorious fruit of the people's common struggle. We are satisfied, we are all jubilant, and we will forever remember this most memorable day, because this country, from now on, belongs to the people.
    The People's Republic of China, under the wise leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao Zedong, and through the arduous struggle of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, is finally born. Such a tremendous, earth-shaking undertaking has finally succeeded. In the world's democratic camp, this powerful force, accounting for a quarter of the world's population, has finally joined. They will completely eliminate the reactionaries domestically, and they will certainly make the reactionaries of the whole world tremble.
    The task of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference will certainly be accomplished. The new China will create an even greater history. We will forever follow Chairman Mao Zedong's banner and advance. Every one of our people has unparalleled confidence and unparalleled strength to welcome the great victory of great Marxism-Leninism.

    Wen Jiasi, Professor, North China University Second Branch
    The CPPCC conference, which the people of the whole country have been longing for, has opened. This is not only a major event in Chinese history, but also a major event in the history of all mankind.
    It has only one task, which is to oppose imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism; it has only one goal, which is to establish an independent, democratic, peaceful, and unified new China; it has only one leader, which is the vanguard of the proletariat – the Communist Party of China. During the conference, it will formulate the Common Program of the CPPCC and the Organic Law of the Central People's Government, elect the National Committee of the CPPCC and the committees of the Central People's Government, formulate the national flag and national emblem, and decide on the location of the capital and the era name.
    The old China will perish from this point on, and the new China will be born from this point on. Every one of us Chinese people must stand at our own posts, abide by the Common Program, and, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, accomplish this great historical task.

    He Luo, Professor, North China University Second Branch
    The flowers of freedom are irrigated with blood and sweat; the fruits of happiness grow from suffering. As we welcome the founding ceremony of the People's Republic of China, I cannot help but feel a mix of sadness and joy!
    I am joyful, I am joyful that our country is no longer like a broken mulberry leaf, allowing those silkworms to gnaw and devour it; from now on, the Chinese nation will appear in the world with the attitude of a creator of high culture. The people will live, rest, sing, and laugh in the way they love.
    I am saddened, I am saddened that those noble-minded people who hung their heads high and whose bodies were laid out in the wilderness, who gave their lives for the interests of the people, cannot personally hear such a magnificent march of liberation today and see the birth of such a glorious and brilliant new China, and continue to contribute their valuable strength.
    Therefore, when we celebrate the opening of the CPPCC, we must even more show the spirit of beating a drowning dog and resolutely eliminate all visible and invisible enemies at home and abroad; we must even more remember that "it was not easy to build" by the martyrs, and in the future nation-building cause, we must be "diligent and thrifty" and "vow to never slacken." We must raise the banner of Mao Zedong even higher, insert it further, more, and more firmly.
    Let us quickly build this bridge of new democracy! Not only the people of China, but even the people of the entire East, will steadily pass through here and rush to that new society with red stars shining brightly, which is more free and happier.

    Li Helin, Professor, North China University
    This conference makes the absolute majority of people in the world jubilant, but it also shocks and terrifies the Chinese and foreign reactionaries! It is the fruit of the Chinese people's struggle and victory, and also the fruit of the struggle and victory of the people of the world. It will produce a central people's government under the leadership of the proletariat, that is, under the leadership of the most advanced political party in China, the Communist Party of China, a people's democratic dictatorship; this government will lead a quarter of the world's population on the road to true liberation, completely eliminate the reactionary forces, and establish an independent, free, equal, and happy country. It will realize what Chairman Mao said in his opening speech: "The era when the Chinese were regarded as uncivilized is over. We will appear in the world as a nation with a high degree of culture." We cheer for the future of this nation! We cheer for "the shortening of the human liberation schedule due to the victory of the Chinese people's liberation!"
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　September 22nd, at North China University.

    Ding Haochuan, Deputy Director, North China University Second Branch
    I carefully read all the news about the opening of the CPPCC and Chairman Mao's speech in today's newspaper, and I carefully looked at the entire list of CPPCC representatives. Ah, the great unity of the people of the whole country! Ah, the great victory of the people's war and the people's great revolution—let us cheer! The suffering of the nation, the humiliation and miserable days of the working people for hundreds and thousands of years are forever in the past; a vast and boundless bright future is unfolding before us. I gaze at Chairman Mao's portrait in the newspaper. Ah, it is you who led us to achieve today's victory; it is you who are leading us to build the building of the new China. You are the banner of unity, the banner of victory! I am willing to prepare myself well so that I can better contribute my humble strength in the construction of the new China building.
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Sept. 22.

    Wu Qingyou, Professor, Peking University
    The convening of the CPPCC proves that the people's century has arrived, the new China, the People's Democratic Republic, is about to be born, and the Kuomintang's reactionary rule is gone forever. This is the result of Chairman Mao and the CPC's wise leadership, this is the result of the heroic fighting of the People's Liberation Army, this is the result of the concerted efforts of all the working people and democratic parties. The policy guidelines formulated by the new CPPCC are the guiding principles for our cultural and educational workers. We must serve the people wholeheartedly so as not to fail the people's expectations and to fulfill our responsibilities in the arduous nation-building cause!

    Fei Qing, Professor, Peking University
    Last night I attended the first session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in the auditorium, and today the People's Daily wants me to express my thoughts. My feelings, just like any Chinese person, are full of mixed emotions of sadness and joy.
    We remember the old CPPCC three years ago. At that time, many people in suffering naively called out "Only success is allowed, failure is not allowed," but American imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang treated it as a scam from the beginning, and finally tore up all the agreements and launched a cruel anti-people's war. After this painful experience, the people recognized who our enemies were and who our own people were. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the people's power finally grew quickly. The naive dreams of three years ago have finally become a reality. What the people allowed has finally succeeded, and what the people did not allow has finally failed. This is the iron law of history.
    This CPPCC conference, as Chairman Mao said in his opening speech, shows that the Chinese people have stood up from now on. From now on, the Chinese people will grasp their own destiny, so we not only celebrate the success of our liberation with unlimited joy, but also take on the heavy responsibility of self-reliance with a solemn and respectful mood. We believe that the people's democratic dictatorship and the unity of international friends will guarantee the success of our nation-building cause, but how we can achieve these two points still requires the unity and efforts of the people.

    Huang Jingtao, Principal, National Peiping Mongolian-Tibetan School
    When I read the news released by the People's Daily about the opening of the CPPCC, I and my colleagues were simply ecstatic, and everyone danced and cheered. We all called it "a great event for mankind."
    Indeed, the convening of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is indeed an epoch-making historical event of world significance. It is a grand event that the people of all ethnic groups in China (including the people of Inner Mongolia) have been eagerly looking forward to for many years. It represents the disillusionment of the rule of foreign imperialism and its Chinese running dogs – the Kuomintang reactionary government, represents the great victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War and the increase in the awareness of the people of all ethnic groups, and represents the great unity of all ethnic groups in the country and the new beginning of national-scale construction in the new China.
    The convening of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is completely in line with the wishes of the people of Inner Mongolia. The people of Inner Mongolia, like the people of other ethnic groups in the country, love their motherland. They hope that their motherland is an independent, democratic, peaceful, unified, prosperous, and strong country. For the liberation of their own nation, for the unity of the people of all ethnic groups, and for the establishment of such a country, they have been unyielding and persevering in their struggle for many years. Three years ago, the people of Inner Mongolia also hoped for the old CPPCC conference, which included the Kuomintang reactionaries, but the result of the conference was completely destroyed by the Kuomintang reactionary government. These criminals, with their fascist ferocity, frantically attacked the people of the whole country, attacked the people of Inner Mongolia, and attempted to extinguish the democratic flames of the whole country and subvert the autonomy of the people of Inner Mongolia. Their criminal acts greatly educated the people, making them understand that there can be no compromise with imperialism and its running dog Kuomintang, thus making the awareness of the people unprecedentedly high and immediately making the people of all ethnic groups (including the people of Inner Mongolia) unite and resolutely support the People's Liberation Army and launch the People's Liberation War. After three years of sacrifice and struggle, now, we have finally defeated the enemy, liberated most of the motherland, ended Chiang Kai-shek's criminal rule, launched a new stage of construction in the new China, and convened the CPPCC conference. The convening of the CPPCC is the result of the people's struggle.
    The CPPCC conference is formed entirely on a new basis. At this conference, not only are there representatives from various democratic parties, democratic figures, all strata, and all regions, but also representatives from overseas Chinese and all ethnic groups in the country (including Inner Mongolia). This is a great unity among all ethnic groups. Comrade Liu Shaoqi said: "The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is an organizational form of the Chinese People's Democratic United Front, and it is the most important concrete form of the revolutionary great unity of the people of the whole country." Completely correct. For twenty-two years, the people of Inner Mongolia have been subjected to cruel massacres and devastation under the bloody rule of the reactionaries. Not only do they have no equal political status, but also the unity with the people of all ethnic groups has been undermined by reactionary provocations; but today, the people of Inner Mongolia have been liberated. Not only are they no longer oppressed and discriminated against, but they are also gloriously electing their own representatives to participate in this people's conference to discuss major issues in the construction of the new China that are beneficial to the people of all ethnic groups, realizing the long-cherished wish of the people of Inner Mongolia. How moving this is! Here, the people of Inner Mongolia clearly know that the reason why the people of all ethnic groups in the country have today is by no means accidental. This is due to the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China and the people's leader Chairman Mao and the heroic struggle of the People's Liberation Army. Therefore, when we face such a victorious situation today, we cannot but thank our leader Chairman Mao and pay him our highest respect.
    The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference has opened, and we wholeheartedly support this conference and the various resolutions that this conference is about to pass. We believe that since the people of all ethnic groups in China have overcome difficulties and defeated the enemy in the past few years due to the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the unity of the people of all ethnic groups; then, in the future construction of the new China, under the leadership of the CPC and with the unity of the people of all ethnic groups, we will be able to overcome various difficulties and defeat any enemy's conspiracies and sabotage, making an independent, free, peaceful, prosperous, and strong new China stand tall on the earth.
    Celebrate the convening of the CPPCC!
    Long live Chairman Mao!
    Long live the new China!

　　祝新中国诞生
  　北大教授唐兰
    中国人民政协开幕了，这不仅是在中国历史上，并且是在全世界的历史上揭开了最新的一页。旧的中国早已在趋于灭亡，我们四万万七千五百万人民仰着头，期待了很久了，新中国的诞生，是人民共同的愿望，也是人民共同的奋斗所得到的胜利果实，我们自己满足了，我们人人都欢欣鼓舞，我们将永远记得这最可以纪念的日子，因为这国家从现在起是人民的了。
    中华人民共和国是在伟大的领袖毛泽东主席英明领导下，中国共产党和中国人民解放军的艰苦奋斗下，终于诞生了。这样翻天覆地的大事业，终于成功了。在世界的民主阵营中，终于加入了这一支强大的，占全世界人口四分之一的生力军，他们在国内已将使反动派完全消灭，他们当然要让全世界的反动派发抖了。
    中国人民政协的任务，一定是能够完成的，新的中国将创造更伟大的历史，我们将永远跟随在毛泽东的旗帜下前进，我们每个人民都有无比的信心，我们有无比的力量，来迎接伟大的马列主义的伟大的胜利。
    北大教授闻家驷
    全国人民久所渴望的政协会议已经开幕了。这不但是中国历史上的一件大事，而且是全人类历史上的一件大事。
    它的任务只有一个，就是反帝反封建反官僚资本；它的目标只有一个，就是建立独立民主和平统一的新中国；它的领导只有一个，就是无产阶级先锋队——中国共产党。在会议进行期间，它将要制定人民政协的共同纲领和中央人民政府的组织法，选举人民政协的全国委员会和中央人民政府的委员会，制定国旗、国徽，决定国都的所在地以及年号。
    旧中国从此灭亡，新中国从此诞生。我们每一个中国人都要站在自己的岗位上，遵照共同纲领，在中国共产党的领导之下来完成这个伟大的历史任务。
    华大二部教授何洛
    自由的鲜花是用血汗来灌溉的；幸福的果子是从苦难中成长的。迎着中华人民共和国的开国大典，我不禁“悲喜交集”！
    我喜，我喜咱们的国家再不象一片破碎的桑叶，让那些蚕虫来啮食吞噬了；从此中华民族将以高度文化创建者的姿态出现在世界上。人民是按照着自己爱好的方式来生活，作息，歌唱，欢笑的。
    我悲，我悲那些头悬高竿，尸陈郊野，为了人民的利益而粉身碎骨的仁人志士，今天，他们不能亲自听到这样雄伟的解放进行曲，看到这样光辉灿烂的新中国的诞生，而再继续贡献出他们底宝贵的力量。
    因此，当我们庆祝人民政协开幕的时候，更要拿出打落水狗的精神来，坚决消灭一切国内国外有形无形的敌人；更要记取先烈的“缔造不易”，而在今后的建国大业中“克勤克俭”，“矢志弗懈”。更要把毛泽东的旗帜举得更高，插得更远，更多，更坚牢。
    让我们赶快搭好这座新民主主义的大桥罢！不仅中国的人民，乃至整个东方的人民，都将从这里稳步通过而奔赴到那红星高照的，更加自由，幸福的新的社会去。
    华大教授李何林
    这个会议使世界上绝对大多数人民欢欣鼓舞，但也使中外反动派震惊颤栗！它是中国人民奋斗胜利的果实，也是全世界人民奋斗胜利的果实。它将产生一个在无产阶级领导之下，也就是在中国最先进的政党中国共产党领导之下的人民民主专政的中央人民政府；这个政府将领导着世界上四分之一的人民，走上真正解放的道路，彻底肃清反动势力，建立独立，自由，平等，幸福的国家。实现毛主席在开幕词里所说的：“中国人被人认为不文明的时代已经过去了，我们将以一个具有高度文化的民族出现于世界。”我们为这个民族前途欢呼！我们为“由于中国人民解放胜利而缩短了人类解放的日程”而欢呼！
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　九月二十二日于华大。
    华大二部副主任丁浩川
    我仔细地读了今天报纸上关于人民政协开会的全部消息和毛主席的讲话，我仔细地看了政协代表的全部名单。呵，全国人民的大团结！呵，人民战争和人民大革命的伟大胜利—让我们欢呼吧！民族的苦难，劳动人民百年千年的屈辱悲惨的日子永远成为过去了；一个广阔无边的光明前途展开在我们面前了。我凝视着报上毛主席的像。呵，是你，领导着我们取得了今天的胜利；是你领导着我们建设新中国的大厦。你是团结的旗帜，胜利的旗帜！我愿意好好地整备我自己，使我能更好地在新中国大厦的建筑过程中尽上点滴的力量。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　九，二二。
    北大教授吴清友
    人民政协的召开，是证明人民世纪业已降临，新中国，人民民主共和国即将诞生，国民党的反动统治已经一去不复返了。这是毛主席及中共英明领导的成果，这是人民解放军英勇战斗的成果，这是全体劳动人民及各民主党派和衷共济的成果。新政协所制定的施政方针，是我们文教工作者的指导原则。我们要全心全意为人民服务，才不辜负人民的期望，才能在艰巨的建国事业上尽一分责任！
    北大教授费青
    昨天晚上我在旁听席上参加了中国人民政协第一届会议，今天人民日报要我表示一点感想。我的感想，正和任何一个中国人民一样，正是万感衷来，悲喜交集。
    我们记得三年前的旧政协，当时多少苦难中的人民曾天真地叫着“只许成功，不许失败”，但是美帝和蒋介石国民党却自始就把它当骗局玩，终于撕毁了一切协议，发动了残酷的反人民战争。经过这个惨痛经验，人民认清了究竟谁是我们的敌人，谁是我们的自己人。在共产党毛主席的领导下，人民力量终于很快的长成，三年前的天真梦想，现在终于成为事实。人民所许的终于成功，人民所不许的终于失败，这是历史的铁律。
    这次政协会议，正如毛主席在开幕词中所说，乃表明中国人民从此站立起来了。此后中国人民将把握住自己的命运，所以我们一方面以无限的欣喜来庆祝自己解放的成功，另一方面更以郑重肃穆的心情来负担起这个自力更生的重任。我们相信人民民主专政和团结国际友人，将保证我们建国大业的成功，但是我们怎样才能做到这两点，还需要人民的团结努力。
    国立北平蒙藏学校校长黄静涛
    当读到人民日报发布的人民政协开幕的消息时，我及我的同仁们简直高兴的发狂了，大家均手舞脚蹈，欢欣鼓舞，我们均叫它做“人类大喜事”。
    真的，人民政治协商会议的召开，确是一件具有世界意义的划时代的历史事件，它是中国各族（内蒙人民在内）人民多年来所热切盼望的盛举，它表示了外国帝国主义及其中国走狗——国民党反动政府统治的幻灭，表示了中国人民解放战争的伟大胜利及各族人民觉悟程度的增高，表示了国内各族人民大团结及新中国全国规模建设的新开始。
    中国人民政治协商会议的召开，是完全适合于内蒙人民的意愿的。内蒙人民正象国内其它各族人民一样，是热爱自己的祖国的，他们希望自己的祖国是一个独立、民主、和平、统一、富强的国家，为了自己民族的解放，为了各族人民的团结，为了这样一个国家的建立，多年来一直不屈不挠坚持奋斗着。三年前，内蒙人民也曾有望于旧的包括国民党反动派在内的政协会议，然而会议的结果竟被国民党反动政府所破坏无余。这些凶犯们挟其法西斯凶焰、疯狂地进攻全国人民，进攻内蒙人民，妄图扑灭全国民主火焰，颠覆内蒙人民自治。他们这种罪恶行为，大大教育了人民，使人民懂得了与帝国主义及其走狗国民党是不能妥协的，因而使人民的觉悟程度空前提高并立即使各族人民（内蒙人民在内）团结一致，在中国共产党领导之下坚决地支援解放军，展开了人民解放战争。经过三年的牺牲奋斗，到现在，终于战胜了敌人，解放了祖国的大部，结束了蒋介石的罪恶统治，展开了新中国建设的新阶段，召开了人民政协会议。人民政协的召开，是人民斗争胜利的结果。
    人民政协会议完全是在新的基础上形成的，在这个会议上，不特有各民主党派、各民主人士、各阶层各地区的代表，而且还有海外华侨及国内各民族（内蒙的在内）的代表参加，这是一个各民族的大团结。刘少奇同志说：“中国人民政治协商会议，是中国人民民主统一战线的组织形式，是全国人民实行革命大团结的一种最重要的具体形式。”完全正确。内蒙人民二十二年来在反动派血腥统治下，遭到了残酷的虐杀，摧残，不但政治上没有平等地位，而且与各族人民的团结，也受到反动的挑拨；然而今天，内蒙人民是翻身了，它不特不再被压迫被歧视；而且光荣地推选自己的代表参加这一人民的会议，以商讨新中国有利于各族人民建设的大事，实现了内蒙人民的夙愿，这是多么感动人的事！在这里，内蒙人民清楚地知道：全国各族人民之所以有今天，决不是偶然的，这是由于中国共产党及人民的领袖毛主席的英明领导和人民解放军的英勇奋斗的结果。因此，当我们面对着这样一个胜利的局面的今天，我们不能不感谢我们的领袖毛主席并向他致崇高的敬意。
    中国人民政治协商会议已经揭幕了，我们竭诚拥护这一会议及这一会议即将通过的各种决议。我们相信，中国各族人民既然在过去的几年中由于中国共产党的领导及各族人民的团结，曾克服了困难，战胜了敌人；那么，在今后新中国的建设中，同样在中共的领导下，在各族人民的团结下，将更能克服各种困难，战胜任何敌人的阴谋破坏，使一个独立自由和平富强的新中国屹立于地球之上。
    庆祝人民政协会议的召开！
    毛主席万岁！
    新中国万岁！
