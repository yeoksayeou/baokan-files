　　Ping Electric Tram Company's System is Not Strict
  　Thirty Trams Destroyed in Rain
  　Workers' Opinions Should Be Heeded for Thorough Review
    [Ping City News] Due to heavy rain on the evening of the 24th of last month, the Ping City Electric Tram Company failed to bring in trams in time, resulting in most of them being soaked in rainwater. This burned out components such as the electric rollers, damaging a total of thirty trams. The loss of materials and labor costs exceeded 10 million yuan. Adding the lost ticket revenue due to repairs, the total loss amounted to approximately 30 million yuan, equivalent to more than 170,000 jin of millet. According to the review by the on-duty staff that night, the main reasons for such a huge loss were: (1) Subjectively, it was assumed that there would be no heavy rain in late autumn, so actions were slow, and trams were brought in too late. (2) Rainfall varied in different areas, and the inspector-in-chief, located in Dongdan, could not quickly understand the situation in all areas. This affected the deployment of tram retrieval and power outages. (3) The rain was too heavy, and the electric rollers were completely submerged. Moreover, the area near the South Factory was low-lying with a lot of silt, causing trams to derail, which affected the retrieval of trams. However, during the heavy rain that night, the tram staff demonstrated a spirit of active responsibility. Feng Linzhang, a foreman at the North Factory, saw that the rain was heavy and the trams were still running. He called the inspector-in-chief six times without getting through. Afterwards, he notified the North Substation to cut off the power. Near Chongyuan Temple, excessive water accumulated. District Inspector Chang Zhi gathered several workers to remove the iron grates of the culverts in the heavy rain to allow the water to drain and prevent damage to the trams. The day after the damaged trams were towed into the South Factory, dozens of conductors and drivers immediately gathered for a meeting, demanding that responsibility be investigated. The night shift workers and day shift workers of the electrical team challenged each other to complete the repair of the eleven trams with damaged roller cores before September 10, shortening the original planned 37-day schedule by half. Driver Sheng also cooperated with the electricians to test how to modify the resistance and improve insulation efficiency.
    From this "rain disaster," the employees have already learned a lesson. Recently, whenever it is overcast, the inspector-in-chief quickly retrieves the trams in advance and informs the dispatchers everywhere to consider the situation and retrieve the trams in case of rain, without waiting for orders (because telephone lines are easily disrupted during heavy rain). This incident shows that since the company was taken over half a year ago, many old and unreasonable systems have not been improved (such as the inspector-in-chief controlling the retrieval of trams, etc.), and new systems have not been fully established. Moreover, the company's administrative leadership does not pay enough attention to the opinions of the workers. After this incident, only the inspectors were convened for a review, without seeking the opinions of the conductors and drivers. Therefore, the leadership cannot easily know the valuable opinions of the workers. The company's administrative leadership should pay more attention to the opinions of the workers in the future and begin to reform the old and unreasonable systems and establish new and necessary working systems to prevent the same incident from happening again.

### 平电车公司制度不严密　雨天毁电车三十辆　应倾听工人意见深刻检讨

　　平电车公司制度不严密
  　雨天毁电车三十辆
  　应倾听工人意见深刻检讨
    【平市讯】平市电车公司于上月二十四日晚大雨中，因电车收车不及，大部被雨水浸淋，烧毁电滚子等机件，共计坏车三十辆。损失工料费一千多万元，加上因修车而少收的票款，损失约达三千万元，合小米十七万多斤。据当日晚班路员的检讨，造成如此巨大损失的主要原因是：（一）主观上以为秋深不会有大雨，所以行动迟缓，收车太慢。（二）各处降雨大小不一，稽查长在东单，短时间内对各处情况了解不够。影响收车与停电的布置。（三）雨水过大，电滚子全被水浸，而且南厂附近，地低而淤沙多，致车出轨，影响收车。但在当晚大雨时，车路员工们都表示了积极负责的精神，北厂领班冯林章，看见雨大了，车还在走，他给稽查长连打六次电话都不曾打通，之后，就通知北变流厂停了电。崇元观附近积水过多，区稽查常志就集合几个工人，在大雨下搬开暗沟的铁篦子，让水下去，以免泡坏了车。第二天坏车拖进南厂后，几十个司售员马上集合开会，要求追究责任。电工班的夜班工人与白班工人互相挑战应战，要争取在九月十日前完成修好坏了滚子心的十一辆车，较原计划三十七天缩短一半日程。司机生也和电工合作，试验如何改造阻力，提高绝缘的效率。
    从这次“雨劫”里，职工们已得到教训。最近，每逢阴天，稽查长就事先迅速收车，而且电告各处排车员，遇见雨天，就斟酌情形收车，不必再等命令（因大雨时电话易断）。从这次事件，可以看出，该公司接管半年以来，许多旧的不合理的制度，还没有改善（如稽查长掌握收车等），新的制度还没有完全树立起来。而且该公司行政领导上对工人的意见不够重视，这次事件发生后，只召集了稽查们检讨，而没有征求司售员们的意见。因此，工人的宝贵意见，领导上也就不易知道。该公司行政领导今后应更重视工人的意见，着手进行改革旧的不合理的制度，和建立新的必要的工作制度，才能防止同样的事件再度发生。
