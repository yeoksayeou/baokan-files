Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, September 1st: A grand rally of 500,000 people in Changsha was held on August 30th to celebrate the peaceful liberation and support the front lines.

The conference adopted a congratulatory telegram to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu. The text of the telegram is as follows: Respected Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu:

　　On the night of August 5th, when we saw our own People's Liberation Army troops marching into the city, how excited and thrilled we were! The entire city of Changsha was boiling, and 500,000 citizens crowded the streets, rejoicing all night long. When we shook hands with our PLA brothers, we recalled the arduous years of the past twenty years and more, and realized that without your wise leadership, we would not have been able to see the light of day again and achieve this great victory. Today, 500,000 people in Changsha are holding a grand rally to celebrate the peaceful liberation and support the front lines. We would like to express our highest respect and gratitude to you. Thanks to your wise leadership and the correct urban policies of the Communist Party of China, as well as the PLA's strict discipline, people from all walks of life have been moved. Since the liberation of Changsha, order has been restored, the market has prospered, and transportation and production have been rapidly restored. The movements to comfort the troops and reject the use of silver dollars are surging forward. In order to further mobilize the strength of the broad masses and effectively ensure the completion of the glorious tasks of developing production and supporting the front lines, all the people of Changsha are holding this celebration and support the front lines rally today. Because we know that the revolution must be carried through to the end, and we must actively support the PLA in its advance into Guangdong and Guangxi and the Southwest, and fight to Taiwan, to finally eliminate the remaining forces of the Kuomintang reactionaries, before we can enter into a permanent peaceful construction. We wish you good health!
