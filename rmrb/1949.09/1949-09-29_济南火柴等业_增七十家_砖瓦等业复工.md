　　Jinan Match Industry and Others
  　Increase by Seventy
  　Brick and Tile Industries Resume Work
    [Our Newspaper Jinan News] Under the support and encouragement of the People's Government, Jinan's private industry is gradually developing. All 458 machine industries (306 internal combustion machines and 152 manual machines) resumed work in April this year. According to a recent survey, 73 more match, machinery, oil pressing, pigment, and iron industries have been added. The resumption of work in the 28 sawmill and pole making industries and brick and tile industries that had been closed for many years before liberation shows the construction trend of the people's Jinan. In some private factories, workers' enthusiasm for work has increased and attention has been paid to saving costs and increasing output because workers' lives are reasonably guaranteed. In the past, Yuhua Match Factory could only produce two boxes of matches from one portion of medicine (more than eight pounds). As a result of the workers' serious saving of raw materials, they can now produce three boxes of matches. Manager Gao Lianpei of the factory therefore added a machine, built eleven new houses, and hired eight more workers. The factory's daily output of matches has now increased from ten boxes to fifteen boxes. The famous Chengtong Yarn Factory's three-year production plan has already added ten steel wire machines, fifteen fine spinning machines, and thirty cloth machines in the first year.

　　济南火柴等业
  　增七十家
  　砖瓦等业复工
    【本报济南讯】济南市私营工业在人民政府的扶植与鼓励下，正逐步发展。四百五十八家机器工业（内动力机器三百零六家，人力机器一百五十二家）今年四月全部复工。据最近调查，火柴、机器、榨油、颜料、铁工业，又增加了七十三家。解放前停业多年的二十八家锯木制杆业、砖瓦业均已重新开工，这两大行业的恢复，可以看出人民的济南建设动向。若干私营工厂中，由于工人生活得到合理保障，劳动热情提高，注意节约成本提高产量。裕华火柴厂过去一个药（八斤多重）只制两箱火柴，工人认真节约原料的结果，现在竟可制三箱火柴。该厂高连佩经理便因此增添了一部机器，新建十一间房子，加雇了八个工人。现该厂火柴每日产量，已从十箱提至十五箱。著名的成通纱厂三年生产计划，第一年已增添了钢丝机十部，精纺机十五部，布机三十部。
