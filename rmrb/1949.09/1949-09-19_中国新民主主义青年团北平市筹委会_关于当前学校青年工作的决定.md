　　China New Democratic Youth League Beiping Municipal Preparatory Committee
　　Decision on Current Youth Work in Schools
　　September 15, 1949

　　(1) The central task of students is to study. Currently, the purpose of students' study is to build a New Democratic New China and serve the people. Therefore, the content of study must be national, scientific, and mass-oriented; it must be social and natural science knowledge that is useful for the New Democratic revolution and construction; it must oppose feudal, comprador, and fascist reactionary ideas, mobilize and educate the masses to wage a resolute struggle against these reactionary ideas, thoroughly eliminate their influence in the minds of young people, and develop the idea of serving the people. The method of study should be consistent with theory and practice, and it is necessary to study and use the Marxist-Leninist stand, viewpoint, and method to study lessons and analyze problems. Youth League members must help run the school well in accordance with the New Democratic education policy, and unite teachers and students to do a good job in New Democratic study. This is the central task of the Youth League in schools at present. League members must study hard in terms of ideology and academics, and unite and organize teachers and students to teach and learn well, not look for another central task. Work and study are unified, not contradictory. The new youth must have the qualities of enthusiastically serving the people and connecting with the masses, possess historical, realistic, and scientific ideological viewpoints, strive to master specialized knowledge and work skills, and have a healthy body.

　　(2) Without the cooperation of progressive professors, lecturers, teaching assistants, and teachers, it is impossible to reform teaching content and teaching methods by relying solely on students. This is even more true in middle schools. We should encourage and strive for the progress of teachers, and strengthen the connection and help of teachers to students. The relationship of teacher-student antagonism caused by the past reactionary rule should be improved. The broad masses of teachers and students should strengthen unity on the basis of New Democratic ideology and common progress. However, we must struggle against reactionary ideas and remarks. Appropriate criticism must be made of erroneous and backward ideas. (Schools may appropriately try out teacher-student forums or gatherings, and report the experience to the Municipal Preparatory Committee.)

　　(3) In the five months from September this year to January next year, universities and middle schools can carry out the following specific tasks in order, according to specific circumstances (can be increased or decreased as needed): (A) Reorganize branches, democratically re-elect, formulate a specific work plan for half a year, and cooperate with the Communist Party branch in the school to convene forums of class representatives and activists to announce the Youth League's work policy for the next semester and solicit opinions. (B) Welcome new students, introduce the situation in the school, and exchange thoughts and experiences of summer study. Help new students solve problems in life and study. (C) Fully promote the democratic spirit and re-elect the student union. (D) Lead the reorganization of learning mutual aid groups so that they can regularly lead learning mutual aid based on individual learning (it is necessary to prevent the tendency of little reading and too much discussion). If the school has formulated and promulgated a teaching plan, then launch discussions and formulate individual learning plans where possible. (E) Actively assist the school affairs committee to promote the gradual reform of curriculum and school administration. Private schools that have not yet established a school affairs committee should strive to establish one to further expand democratic life in the school. (F) Regularly supervise and check the implementation of the learning plan and the work of the learning group in the middle of the semester. (G) In the short period before the semester examination, launch a review and organize students to prepare for the exam. (H) After the exam is over, cooperate with the administration to summarize the study.

　　(4) Youth League branches in schools should pay attention to various personal issues in the lives of the broad masses of students, and should organize everyone's strength to help solve them as much as possible. The assessment of people's scholarships must be realistic. Those who should not receive them should not apply, but those who should receive them should not be mobilized not to receive them in an overly left-leaning manner. All possible means should be used, such as organizing students to engage in spare-time labor production to improve their lives; pay attention to running the meals well; and organize mutual aid for diseases.

　　(5) Extracurricular activities should generally be streamlined, but it is necessary to actively participate in various necessary social activities and social service work with the broad masses of students (such as mass rallies and literacy classes, night schools, etc.), and at the same time strengthen attention to developing mass sports activities and cultural and recreational activities (appropriately combined with music and sports courses) to cultivate young people's healthy bodies and lively style.

　　The Municipal Youth League Preparatory Committee, the Municipal Student Federation Preparatory Committee, and the Municipal Youth Federation Preparatory Committee will jointly hold two or three city-wide large-scale "Youth Days" to welcome the broad masses of students to participate. The center may include: (1) sports meeting, (2) autumn travel and hiking, (3) half-day labor, (4) music and dance performances. Each time, the principle is to hold it for one day on Sunday, and invite experts to give reports.

　　In extracurricular activities, the division of labor must be precise, everyone must participate, and try not to hold multiple positions. Those under the management of the school administration shall be responsible by the school. There is no need to run too many wall newspapers, but concentrate efforts to run them well.

　　(6) In the internal organizational life of the League, in addition to holding a "League Day" once a month (which can sometimes be combined with the aforementioned "Youth Day"), there is also a general branch meeting, mainly for arranging, discussing and reviewing work. If necessary, additional general branch meetings can be held to discuss work. Reduce group meetings, generally hold them once a month, the content can discuss specific work issues that are not suitable for discussion at the general branch meeting, and can appropriately conduct self-criticism and criticism, and at the same time, it is necessary to commend and encourage the progressive performance and exemplary deeds of League members, and study the admission of new League members, etc. In order to streamline meetings without affecting work, there must be sufficient preparation before the meeting. Fragmentary events are discussed and resolved outside the meeting, and there is no need to discuss them at the meeting.

　　(7) In League study, it is necessary to strengthen the ideological education of Marxism-Leninism, and it should be combined with actual struggle and actual work. It is necessary to analyze various issues in political life from a Marxist-Leninist perspective and guide practical actions. In addition to "League Day" and "Youth Lectures", it is usually necessary to promote League members to read newspapers, and it is necessary to organize reading and discussion of important articles in "China Youth", "Beiping Youth" and other League publications. The Propaganda Department of the Municipal Youth League Preparatory Committee will soon draw up a catalog of youth reading materials to encourage League members to read. Learning should be long-term, and oppose impatience and demands for short-term raids.

　　(8) Actively develop League members in the movement and in actual struggle, mainly to improve students ideologically and politically, and enhance students' understanding and understanding of the Youth League. It is necessary to overcome the tendency of closed-doorism, prevent the emergence of formalism, and absorb a wide range of young student activists into the League individually, selectively, and after review, in accordance with the League Constitution and in accordance with the following three specific criteria: (1) progressive thinking (support the propositions of the Chinese Communist Party, be willing to actively strive for the cause of the New Democratic revolution, and be willing to serve the working people faithfully), (2) study hard, (3) upright style. When reviewing and approving, it is necessary to oppose overly complicated procedures (the Organization Department of the Municipal Youth League Preparatory Committee will notify separately after research).

　　(9) Strengthen the education of connecting with the masses, oppose arrogance, looking down on others, not letting go and not believing that others can do good things, impatience, paternalism, undemocratic and other styles that are divorced from the masses. It is necessary to play an exemplary leading role, but it does not mean that one is better than others, but to stand on the people's stand at all times, be humble and responsible, be realistic, take the lead in enduring hardship, and unite everyone to work together. At the same time, adhere to the truth, wage an irreconcilable struggle against all reactionary ideas, and criticize various erroneous ideas (but pay attention to the method). The attitude of fearing to fight and criticize reactionary and backward ideas is incorrect. Only in this way can we achieve the goal of ideologically and closely uniting with the broad masses of students.

　　(10) The specific formulation and implementation of the work plans of each branch must start from different schools, different conditions (historical, administrative authorities, student thinking, party and league strength, etc.), and the specific circumstances at the time and place. Distinguish the differences between universities and middle schools, public and private, progress and backwardness, and determine different content and methods, otherwise mistakes will be made. However, if there are principled modifications during implementation, the consent of the Municipal Youth League Preparatory Committee must be obtained.

　　(11) The work of the Youth League in schools must strive for the cooperation of adults and all parties. First of all, rely on the strong leadership and concern of the Communist Party. Youth League members should realize that the Party's leadership over the Youth League is the decisive link in the development of the Youth League's work. The Youth League branch in the school should first obtain the leadership and help of the Communist Party branch (naturally, it is not to treat the Youth League as an affiliated organization of the Party). Secondly, Youth League members should implement the correct resolutions of the Student Union.

　　(12) Each school's Youth League branch should conduct a serious discussion on this decision, formulate a practical and feasible half-year plan for the branch based on specific circumstances, and report it to the Municipal Youth League Preparatory Committee within two weeks. After that, submit a written detailed report once a month. The University Work Committee and Middle School Work Committee of the Municipal Youth League Preparatory Committee must focus on doing the work of several major schools, summarize experience, and promote overall work.

　　中国新民主主义青年团北平市筹委会
　  关于当前学校青年工作的决定
    一九四九年九月十五日
    （一）学生的中心任务是学习。目前学生学习的目的是为了建设新民主主义的新中国，为人民大众服务。因此，学习的内容必须是民族的，科学的，大众的；必须是对新民主主义革命及建设有用的社会科学和自然科学知识；必须反对封建买办法西斯的反动思想，动员与教育群众向这些反动思想进行坚决的斗争，彻底肃清其在青年思想中的影响，并发展为人民服务的思想。学习的方法应该是理论与实际一致，而且必须学习以马列主义的立场、观点、方法来研究功课，分析问题。青年团员必须按照新民主主义的教育方针帮助把学校办好，团结师生搞好新民主主义学习，这就是当前青年团在学校中的中心工作。团员必须在思想上功课上努力学习好，并团结与组织教师和同学教好学好，并不是另外再去找中心工作。工作与学习是统一的，不是矛盾的。新的青年，必须是具有热心为人民服务、联系群众的品质，具有历史的实事求是的科学的思想观点，力求掌握一种专门知识和工作技能，具有健康的身体。
    （二）没有进步教授讲师助教及教员的合作，单靠学生来改革教学内容与教学方法是不可能的。中学方面更是如此。应鼓励与争取教师的进步，及加强教师对学生的联系与帮助。过去反动统治所造成的师生对立的关系应该改善。广大师生应在新民主主义的思想及共同进步的基础上加强团结。但对于反动的思想言论必须进行斗争。对于错误落后的思想必须进行适当的批评。（各校可适当试行师生座谈会或联欢会，并将经验报告团市筹委会。）
    （三）今年九月至明年一月的五个月内，各大学中学可根据具体情况，大体上依次进行下列各项具体工作（情况需要时，可以增减）：（甲）整理支部，民主改选，制订半年的具体工作计划，与校中的共产党支部配合召开各班代表及积极分子座谈会，宣布青年团下学期工作方针并征求意见。（乙）欢迎新同学，介绍校内情况，交流暑期学习的感想和经验。帮助新同学解决生活与学习上的问题。（丙）充分发扬民主精神改选学生会。（丁）领导整理学习互助小组，使能经常领导以个人学习为基础的学习互助（须防止读书少而讨论多的偏向）。如学校制订并公布了教学计划，则发动讨论并在可能条件下制订个人学习计划。（戊）积极协助校务委员会，促进课程校政的逐步改革。尚未建立校务委员会的私立学校应争取成立，进一步扩大学校内的民主生活。（己）经常督促，并在学期中间检查学习计划执行情况及学习小组的工作。（庚）在学期考试前的短期内，发起温课，组织同学准备考试。（辛）考试完毕后，配合行政，总结学习。
    （四）学校中青年团支部对广大同学生活中的各种切身问题应该重视，并应组织大家力量尽量帮助解决。人民助学金评定须实事求是，不应领者做到不申请，但不应过左地动员应领者也不领。应利用各种可能，如组织同学课余劳动生产以改善生活；注意办好伙食；组织疾病互助。
    （五）课外活动一般须精简，但必须主动和广大同学在一起参加各种必要的社会活动与社会服务工作（如群众性的纪念集会及识字班夜校等），同时加强注意展开群众性的体育活动及文化娱乐活动（适当与音乐体育课程结合），培养青年健康身体与活泼作风。
    团市筹委会与市学联市青联筹委会联合举办二三次全市性大规模“青年日”，欢迎广大同学参加。中心可有：（１）运动会，（２）秋季旅行远足，（３）半日劳动，（４）音乐舞蹈表演。每次以在星期日举行一天为原则，并请专人作报告。
    课外活动中，分工须精密，大家都动手，尽量不要兼职。凡归学校行政管理的则由校方负责。壁报不必多办而要集中力量办好。
    （六）团内组织生活，每月除举行一次“团日”（有时可结合前述“青年日”举行）外，尚开支部大会一次，主要为布置、讨论与检讨工作。必要时可增开支部大会讨论工作。减少小组会，一般地每月举行一次，内容可讨论不适于在支部大会上讨论的具体工作问题，并可适当进行自我批评与批评，同时必须表扬鼓励团员的进步表现与模范事迹，研究吸收新团员等。为精简会议而不影响工作，开会前须有充分准备。零碎事件在会外商量解决，不必在会上讨论。
    （七）团内学习，必须加强马列主义的思想教育，应该同实际斗争实际工作结合起来。要以马列主义观点分析政治的生活的各种问题，并指导实际行动。除“团日”及“青年讲座”以外，平时须推动团员看报纸，并须组织阅读与讨论“中国青年”“北平青年”及其他团刊的重要文章。团市筹委会宣传部即将拟出青年读物的目录，鼓励团员阅读。学习应该从长期着眼，反对急燥及要求短促突击的作法。
    （八）在运动中与实际斗争中积极发展团员，主要是从思想上政治上提高同学，并增强同学对青年团的认识与了解。必须克服关门主义倾向，防止形式主义的产生，按照团章，同时按以下三项具体标准有选择与经过审查地个别吸收广大青年学生积极分子入团：（一）思想进步（拥护中国共产党的主张，愿为新民主主义的革命事业积极奋斗，愿为劳动人民忠诚服务），（二）学习努力，（三）作风正派。在审查批准时须反对过于繁复的手续（团市筹委会组织部研究后另行通知）。
    （九）加强联系群众的教育，反对骄傲自大，看不起旁人，不放手与不相信旁人会办好事，急躁、包办、不民主等脱离群众的作风。要起模范带头作用，但绝不是说自命比旁人高明，而是要时时刻刻站在人民立场，虚心负责，实事求是，吃苦在前，团结大家共同努力。同时坚持真理，与一切反动思想作不调和的斗争，并批判各种错误思想（但须注意方式）。那种惧怕对反动思想及落后思想进行斗争和批评的态度是不对的。只有这样，才能达到思想上和广大同学们亲密团结起来的目的。
    （十）各支部的工作计划的具体制订与执行，必须从不同学校、不同条件（历史的、行政当局的、同学思想的、党团力量的等条件），及当时当地具体情况出发。区别大学与中学，公立与私立，进步与落后等各种情况的不同，确定不同的内容和方法，否则就会犯错误。但执行时如有带原则性修改时，必须请示取得团市筹委会的同意。
    （十一）学校中青年团的工作，必须争取成年人和各方面的合作。首先是依靠共产党的有力领导和关切。青年团员应认识到党对青年团的领导，是青年团工作发展的决定环节，在学校中青年团支部首先应取得共产党支部的领导与帮助（自然也不是把青年团当做党的附属组织）。其次，青年团员要执行学生会的正确的决议。
    （十二）各校青年团支部对本决定应展开认真的讨论，根据具体情况，制订本支部切实可行的半年计划，并于两星期内报告团市筹委会。以后每月作书面详细汇报一次。团市筹委会大学工作委员会及中学工作委员会须有重点地做好几个主要学校的工作，总结经验，以推动全盘工作。
