In order to strengthen the leadership and management of domestic and foreign trade, the Chahar Provincial Trading Company and the Datong and Xuanhua Municipal Trading Companies were ordered to be abolished some time ago. The Grain Company originally under the Chahar Provincial Trading Company was changed to the Zhangjiakou Grain Branch Company, with branch companies in Datong, Xuanhua, Zhangbei, Chaigoubu, and Xiheying. The original Department Store Company was changed to the Zhangjiakou Department Store Branch Company, with branch companies in Datong and Xuanhua. The original Native Produce Company was changed to the Zhangjiakou Native Produce Branch Company, with a branch company in Datong and a native produce team in Hunyuan. The original Fur Company was changed to the Zhangjiakou Fur Branch Company, with branch companies in Duolun and Datong. Three new branch companies for Egg Products, Bristles, and Oils, as well as a Hardware and Machinery Branch Company, were established in Zhangjiakou. All of the above branch companies and the Hardware and Machinery Branch Company are directly led by the respective North China specialized companies, and cadres and funds are also uniformly deployed by North China. Each specialized company maintains close contact with the local leading organs, jointly establishes economic joint meetings, and maintains relations with the provincial industry and commerce departments on issues related to the entire province, and with the relevant departments of the special districts and counties on issues related to the special districts and counties. Each specialized company must fully utilize and support cooperatives, establish certain business relationships, cooperate with each other, and regularly provide business information.
