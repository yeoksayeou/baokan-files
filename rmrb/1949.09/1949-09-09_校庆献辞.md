　　Dedicatory Speech for the School Anniversary
    Fan Wenlan
    Judging from its historical development, North China University has a history of more than ten years; judging from its achievements, it has cultivated more than one hundred thousand revolutionary cadres. Consequently, it has accumulated quite rich experience in the work of reforming intellectuals.

    In the future, according to the new needs put forward by the revolution, North China University will continue to develop. We should value our existing experience without being restricted by it, and we should be realistic and not think from a superficial perspective. Everyone should work hard under the leadership of Principal Wu, and we hope that more and better achievements will be manifested.

　　校庆献辞
    范文澜
    华北大学，从她的沿革说来，已经有十余年的历史；从她的成绩说来，已经培养出上十万的革命干部。因之，在改造知识分子的工作中，积累了颇为丰富的经验。
    今后，按照革命所提出的新的需要，华北大学将继续向前发展。我们应重视已有的经验而不为经验所拘泄，我们要实事求是而不从虚浮处着想。大家在吴校长领导下努力奋斗，希望有更多更好的成绩表现出来。
