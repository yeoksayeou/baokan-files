  　Allocates 10 Billion in Cooperative Loans
  　Distributed to Thirteen Disaster-Stricken Counties in the Province
    [Chengde News] The Northeast Bank's Rehe Provincial Branch and the Rehe Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative have jointly decided to issue 10 billion yuan in autumn cooperative loans in September. The loans will be focused on disaster-stricken areas in thirteen counties within the province and areas with a good foundation for cooperative work. Based on the needs of each area, the funds will be used to purchase by-products, supply farmers with production and daily necessities, develop transportation, support sideline occupations, and resolve difficulties related to draught animals.
    [Western Liaoning News] In order to help rural supply and marketing cooperatives solve their working capital problems, the Fuxin branch of the Northeast Bank issued 385 million yuan in loans to seven cooperatives in Beizhen, helping the cooperatives expand their business scope. After obtaining the loans, the cooperatives in the orchard areas immediately mobilized the masses to weave pear baskets, which promoted the production of orchard farmers and solved the packaging difficulties for the sale of pears. After receiving the loan, the Zhong'anbao Village Cooperative in the Third District planned to buy 100,000 jin of grain from the rear to solve the problem of food shortages for the masses and help them with production.
