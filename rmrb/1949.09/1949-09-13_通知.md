    After the youth of this city participated in the work of opening up Tiananmen Square, the Second Station of Xinhua Broadcasting Station invited students from various broadcasting groups to hold a forum.

It is hoped that student unions, Communist Youth League branches, broadcasting groups, and communication groups of all schools will organize the broad masses of students to listen; and promptly reflect the opinions of the students after listening to us.
