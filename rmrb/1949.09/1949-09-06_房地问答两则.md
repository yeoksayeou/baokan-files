Two Q&A on Real Estate

To the Editor: I have a matter to inquire about:

A relative of mine owns a small house in this city (purchased in 1947), with a property registration certificate (from the Kuomintang ruling period). My relative is currently working in Shanghai and has entrusted me with taking care of the house. I heard that all real estate and other properties registered during the Kuomintang reactionary rule must be re-registered. I wonder if the Beijing Municipal People's Government has such a regulation? If re-registration is required, where should I go to complete the procedures and how much are the fees? I would appreciate a detailed answer.

Mr. Zhong Shen Shumin:

Regarding your question about real estate registration, the Land Administration Bureau replies as follows:

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Editor

According to the "Notice on Real Estate Registration in Urban Areas of This City" that has already been promulgated, those who already have a land ownership certificate issued by the bogus Land Administration Bureau, and whose current real estate situation has not changed, may postpone applying for registration. If there has been a transfer of property rights or an increase or decrease in buildings, they should immediately apply for registration with the Land Administration Bureau of this city's People's Government. The fees are collected according to the total value of the real estate appraisal price list published by the Land Administration Bureau (a registration fee of 1% is collected by the Land Administration Bureau, and a deed tax of 7.5% is collected by the Finance Bureau); if the owner's name remains unchanged when applying for registration, the deed tax will be waived.

Mr. Liu Ying:

The answers to your questions are briefly as follows:

You own a small house in this city. You once served as a school-level military adjutant in the Kuomintang bandit army, but have retired and are now engaged in business. If you are not a war criminal or a suspected war criminal, and currently have no reactionary behavior or other complications, your property in this city will not be confiscated by the People's Government.

　　房地问答两则
    编辑先生：兹有一事请示答：
    鄙亲在本市有自置小房一所（三十六年购置），领有房产登记（国民党统治时期）。现在鄙亲在上海服务，委托本人照顾该房。闻凡过去在国民党反动统治时期内所有房产等已登记者均须重新登记，不知北平市人民政府有此规定否？如须另行登记向何处办理手续及如何缴费？敬希详答是感。

    淑敏钟沈淑敏先生：
    你所问关于房地产登记问题承地政局答复如下：　　　　　　　　
    编者
    依据已经公布之本市城区房地登记须知，其已领有伪地政局发给之土地所有权状，且房地现况并无变更者，暂缓声请登记，如已有产权转移或建筑物增减情形，应即向本市人民政府地政局声请登记，其费用系依照地政局公布之房地评估价额表总值征收（登记费由地政局征收百分之一，契税由财政局征收百分之七·五）；如业主姓名不变声请登记时，免纳契税费用。刘英先生：
    所询问题，兹简复如下：
    在本市置有房屋一小间，本人曾在国民党匪军中充当校级军佐，已退役作商，若非战犯或战犯嫌疑者，现在亦无任何反动行为或其他枝节者，其在本市的房产，不在人民政府没收之列。
