The Soviet people's unity of political aims and moral principles is one of the greatest sources of the Soviet Union's great power. The great October Socialist Revolution laid the foundation for this political and moral unity. As a result of the October Revolution, the Russian working class overthrew the capitalists and landlords, took power into its own hands, and, in alliance with the working peasants, began to build a new socialist society.

On the basis of the socialist construction and complete victory in the Soviet Union, the Soviet people's solid political and moral unity has been established.

In the process of socialist construction, based on the implementation of the Lenin-Stalin policy, by 1934, socialism in the Soviet Union had become the dominant part of the entire national economy. Socialist industry at that time accounted for 99 percent of all industry. The voluntary joining of collective farms by peasants and the elimination of the rich peasants as a class fundamentally changed agriculture. Collective farms and state farms cultivated approximately 90 percent of the total sown area in 1934. Capitalist components were eliminated in industry, agriculture, and commerce. The system of exploitation of man by man was forever eliminated in the Soviet Union. The socialist public ownership of the means of production has been established in all sectors of the national economy, becoming the solid foundation of the new socialist system.

Along with economic changes, the class structure of the Soviet Union also changed. During the years of socialist construction in the Soviet Union, all exploiting elements—capitalists, merchants, rich peasants, and speculators—were eliminated. For the first time in human history, a society without exploitation of man by man was established, where all people have equal rights.

The Soviet laborers—workers, peasants, and intellectuals—have undergone profound changes.

The working class has become a completely new class, unlike any other class in human history. It, in alliance with the working peasants, eliminated the capitalist economic system and established socialist ownership of the means of production. It has become the leading force of the socialist state.

In the process of building and consolidating collective farms, completely new peasants have grown up. "...The peasants of the Soviet Union, the vast majority of whom are collective farmers, that is to say, their work and property are not built on individual labor and backward technology, but on collective labor and modern technology. Finally, the economic foundation of our peasants is not private ownership, but collective ownership grown on the basis of collective labor" (Stalin, "Problems of Leninism," Chinese edition, p. 676).

Soviet intellectuals have also changed. They are entirely new intellectuals. They are all from worker and peasant backgrounds, closely connected with the people, and faithfully serve the people.

Socialist economy, as the economic foundation of Soviet society, and the increasingly strengthened common interests of workers, peasants, and intellectuals bring them ever closer together.

In his report to the Eighth All-Union Congress of Soviets, Comrade Stalin summarized the changes that had taken place in the class composition of the Soviet Union from 1924 to 1936:

"Thus, the class lines among the Soviet laborers are increasingly blurred, and the old class specificities are increasingly disappearing. The economic and political contradictions between workers, peasants, and intellectuals are decreasing and disappearing. Thus, the foundation for moral and political unity of society is created" ("A Short History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)," Chinese edition, p. 421).

The Soviet society's political and moral unity is manifested in the solidarity of the Soviet people regardless of their social status, ethnic and national affiliation, and gender. The workers, peasants, and intellectuals of the Soviet state are building a communist society in firm friendship. The development of socialist economy, science, and culture forms the basis for their prosperous and cultured life. They understand that they are working for themselves, for socialist society, and not for the exploiters—capitalists and landlords. This creates blood-related common interests in the development and consolidation of the socialist economy and its socialist state.

The Soviet people's political and moral unity is manifested in all aspects of life in the Soviet Union.

This unity is first expressed in the people's firm trust in their government, in the Lenin-Stalin Party, and in the genius leader Comrade Stalin.

The Soviet people warmly accept and fully support the policies of their government, regarding them as their true national policies, which truly reflect the fundamental interests of the people.

The entire Soviet people infinitely trust the Bolshevik Party, considering the Party as their political leader, their advanced ranks, and the representative of the people's interests. The Lenin-Stalin Party has no other purpose than to safeguard the interests of the people. It itself has grown up from the core of the working masses, especially from the core of the most advanced class of ordinary workers. Based on their own experience, Soviet laborers are convinced that the Lenin-Stalin Party is the true representative of the opinions, interests, needs, and hopes of the entire people. The Party not only announces correct policies, but also knows how to resolutely implement them. Bolsheviks have always been consistent in word and deed. Lenin-Stalin is the highest manifestation of the Soviet people's political and moral unity.

The unlimited love and loyalty of the entire Soviet people for the Bolshevik Party and the people's leader Stalin is not only a highest form of expression of political and moral unity, but also a symbol of this unity. Molotov said in his report on the twentieth anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution: "The political and moral unity of our people has its own living embodiment. We have a name that has become a symbol of socialist victory. At the same time, this name is a symbol of the political and moral unity of the Soviet people. You know that this name is Stalin."

Under the leadership of their leader and teacher, Comrade Stalin, the Soviet people have built a socialist society and are confidently marching towards communism!

The socialist competition to complete and over-fulfill the national economic plan ahead of schedule, and the Stakhanovite movement, sweeping every corner of the Soviet Union and every sector of the national economy—industry, transportation, agriculture—are brilliant manifestations of the Soviet people's political and moral unity.

The Soviet society's political and moral unity was manifested with extraordinary strength during the Great Patriotic War. All Soviet laborers considered fighting against the fascist aggressors as a major event closely related to themselves, because they knew that the fate of the motherland depended on defeating the enemy. This war was for the freedom and independence of the socialist motherland, for defending the fruits of the great October Socialist Revolution, for liberating the European people from fascist oppression, and for the victory of progress in the world. Encouraged by the Bolshevik Party, the Soviet people did not stop fighting the enemy for any sacrifice. They fought heroically on the front and worked hard to increase production in the rear.

After the Patriotic War, the entire Soviet people wholeheartedly accepted the postwar five-year plan for restoring and developing the national economy, accepting it as their own program, and fought enthusiastically to complete the five-year plan in four years.

Loyalty to the socialist motherland, willingness to sacrifice one's life to defend the motherland, a high degree of understanding of public interests, a socialist attitude towards labor and public property, and the perseverance to achieve the goal without stopping, the ability to correctly understand and overcome difficulties—these are the new moral qualities of the Soviet people. These qualities of the Soviet people are cultivated by the Bolshevik Party, which guides them towards the road to communism! (Enlightenment Translation) (Reprinted from Dalian "Shibao")

　　苏联人民的政治上道德上的统一是苏联强大威力的源泉
    罗静著
    苏联人民政治目的与道德原则的统一是苏联强大威力最伟大源泉之一。伟大十月社会主义革命曾奠定了这个政治道德统一的基础。十月革命的结果，俄国工人阶级推翻了资本家和地主，把政权握在自己手里，与劳动农民联盟开始建设新的社会主义社会。
    在苏联社会主义建设与完全胜利的基础上，业已奠定了苏联人民巩固的政治道德的统一。
    在社会主义建设的过程中，在实现列宁——斯大林政策的基础上，到一九三四年在苏联社会主义部分业已成为国内整个国民经济的统治部分。社会主义工业在当时占全部工业的百分之九十九。农民之志愿加入集体农庄与富农作为阶级被消灭，根本上改变了农业。集体农庄和国营农场在一九三四年所耕种的土地约占全部播种面积的百分之九十。无论在工业中、农业中，以及商业中资本主义的成份都被肃清了。在苏联永远消灭了人剥削人的制度。社会主义生产资料的公有制在国民经济一切部门中已确立起来，成为社会主义新制度巩固的基础。
    与经济变革的同时，苏联的阶级构成也起了变化。在苏联社会主义建设年代，一切剥削分子——资本家、商人、富农、投机者都被肃清了。在整个人类历史上破天荒第一次建立了没有人剥削人的社会，在那里一切人都是权利平等的。
    苏联劳动者——工人、农民和知识分子都深刻地起了变化。
    工人阶级成为完全新的阶级，人类历史上还没有过类似这样的阶级。它和劳动农民联盟共同消灭了资本主义经济制度，并建立了社会主义生产资料所有制。它已成为社会主义国家的领导力量。
    在建设与巩固集体农庄的过程中完全新的农民成长起来了。“……苏联的农民，绝大多数都是集体农庄的农民，就是说，他们的工作和财产不是建筑在个体劳动和落后技术上，而是建筑在集体劳动和现代技术上。最后，我国农民底经济基础不是私人所有制，而是在集体劳动基础上长成的集体所有制”（斯大林著“列宁主义问题”中文版第六七六页）。
    苏联知识分子也发生了变化。他们已经完全是新的知识分子。他们全都是由工农出身，与人民取得密切联系，忠实地为人民服务的。
    作为苏联社会的经济基础的社会主义经济，工人、农民和知识分子利益的共通性日益加强，使他们日益接近。
    斯大林同志在第八次全国苏维埃代表大会上的报告中，对一九二四年到一九三六年苏联阶级成份所发生的变更作了一个总结：
    “这样，苏联劳动者之间的阶级界线已在愈益泯灭，旧时的阶级特殊性已在愈益消失。工人、农民以及知识分子间的经济上政治上的矛盾日益降低和泯灭。于是就造成了社会在道德上政治上统一的基础”（“联共（布）党史简明教程”中文版四二一页）。
    苏联社会政治道德的统一表现在苏联人民不管他们的社会地位、种族与民族属性和性别都团结一致。苏维埃国家的工人、农民和知识分子在牢固的友谊中建设共产主义社会。社会主义经济、科学与文化的发展形成了他们富裕生活和文化生活的基础。他们明白，他们是为自己，为社会主义社会而工作，而不是为剥削者——资本家和地主而工作。在发展和巩固社会主义经济及其社会主义国家之中，这给他们造成了血肉相关的利害关系。
    苏联人民政治道德的统一表现在苏联各部门的生活之中。
    这种统一首先表现了人民对自己政府、对列宁——斯大林党和天才领袖斯大林同志的坚定信任。
    苏联人民热烈地接受与完全拥护自己政府的政策，当作是自己真正的全民政策，这种政策真实地表现出人民的根本利益。
    全苏联人民万分信任布尔什维克党，认为党是自己政治的领导者，是自己先进的队伍，是人民利益的代表人。列宁——斯大林党除了维护人民利益之外，没有其他目的，它本身是从劳动群众核心中成长起来，首先是从普通工人阶级中最先进阶级核心内成长起来的。苏联劳动者根据其亲身体验来确信列宁——斯大林党是全人民意见、利益、需要与希望的真正代表。党不仅宣布正确的政策，而且善于坚决地实现这种政策。布尔什维克从来都是言行一致的。列宁——斯大林是党苏联人民政治道德统一的最高表现。
    全苏联人民对布尔什维克党和人民领袖的无限爱戴和忠诚不仅仅是表现政治道德统一的一种最高形式，而且也是这种统一的标志。莫洛托夫在社会主义十月革命二十周年纪念的自己报告中说道：“我国人民政治道德的统一有着自己活生生的体现。我们有一个名字，这个名字已经成为社会主义胜利的象征。同时这个名字是苏联人民政治道德统一的象征。你们知道，这个名字就是斯大林”。
    苏联人民在自己领袖和导师斯大林同志领导之下建设了社会主义社会，并有信心地向共产主义迈进！
    争取提前完成和超过完成国民经济计划的社会主义竞赛和席卷苏联国内各个角落、各个国民经济部门——工业、运输、农业——的千百万苏联人民底斯达汉诺夫运动，都是苏联人民政治道德统一的辉煌表现。
    苏联社会政治道德的统一以非凡的力量表现在伟大卫国战争时期。苏联全体劳动人民认为与法西斯侵略者作战是与本身血肉相关的，是切身的重大事件，因为他们知道，祖国的命运决定于战胜敌人。这个战争是为了社会主义祖国自由与独立，为了保卫伟大十月社会主义革命的果实，为了从法西斯压迫下解放欧洲人民，为了全世界进步胜利。为布尔什维克党所鼓舞的苏联人民并不因任何牺牲而停止对敌人的斗争，他们在前方英勇地打仗，而在后方则努力加紧生产。
    卫国战争之后，全苏联人民都全心全意接受恢复与发展国民经济的战后五年计划，当作是本身所有的纲领来接受，并为执行五年计划四年完成而狂热地进行斗争。
    忠于社会主义祖国，准备不惜牺牲自己的生命捍卫祖国，高度了解公共的利益，对待劳动和公共财产采取社会主义态度，具有非达到目的不休的刚毅力，善于正确了解和克服困难——这就是苏联人民新的道德品质。苏联人民的这些品质是布尔什维克党所培养的，党引导他们向共产主义道路迈进！（启迪译）（转载自大连“实话报”）
