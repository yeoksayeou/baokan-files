　　North China's Party and Government Leading Organs
　　Fully Organize the Autumn Harvest
　　Attention Should Be Paid to Organizing Labor, Selecting Seeds, Watching Over the Crops, and Protecting the Harvest.
　　[Comprehensive News from Our Newspaper] The hot summer has passed, and early autumn is here. The fruits of the farmers' year-long hard work are about to be harvested. Along with the autumn harvest comes autumn plowing and autumn sowing. This is a busy season for agricultural affairs. Party and government leading organs in various parts of North China are now fully organizing farmers to prepare for the "Three Autumns" (autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and autumn sowing). The Pingyuan Daily recently published an editorial entitled "Strengthen Autumn Work, Implement Increased Production," pointing out that to do a good job in the autumn harvest, it is first necessary to strengthen the current flood prevention work and actively lead the masses to repair and dredge waterways and low-lying areas to reduce the losses caused by autumn seedlings being flooded. At the same time, the masses should be organized to watch over the crops and prevent theft and sabotage by lawbreakers. In disaster-stricken areas, the masses should be organized to engage in production and practice economy for self-salvation, and the masses should be organized to plant late vegetables for famine relief. Cooperatives should do their best to help the masses solve seed problems. The Hebei Provincial People's Government also issued "Three Autumns" instructions in late August, requiring all localities to harvest autumn crops in a timely manner while plowing land and delivering manure to prepare for wheat planting. The instructions stated: In order to overcome the inevitable difficulties encountered in terms of labor and animal power when working on both fronts, it is necessary to widely mobilize women and children to participate in the autumn harvest and, based on the needs of agricultural work and the voluntary participation of the masses, to carry out mutual assistance and work exchange under the principle of benefiting both sides. The instructions also called on all localities to universally mobilize farmers to select seeds. In addition to farms, supply and marketing cooperatives, and other departments collecting and exchanging some superior varieties, the most important thing is to widely organize the masses to select drought-resistant, wind-resistant, insect-resistant, and high-yield superior seeds. In addition, the policy of "whoever plants it harvests it and bears the responsibility" that has already been announced must be thoroughly implemented. The CCP Chahar Provincial Committee and the Chahar Provincial People's Government have also issued instructions successively, calling on the province to concentrate its efforts, strengthen leadership, and mobilize the broad masses to participate in the autumn harvest and autumn plowing movement. Attention should be paid to strengthening crop protection and stopping the activities of saboteurs. The Provincial Government's instructions emphasized that harvesting should be timely, and that crops should be reaped as soon as they are ripe to avoid damage from wind, frost, and freezing. Currently, the Shaziling and other districts of Xuanhua County in the province have formed crop protection committees and have formulated specific crop protection measures, such as organizing militia to take turns watching over the crops, strengthening public security work, and mobilizing the masses to report and monitor thieves. In Gaomiaobao Village, District 1 of Wanquan County, ten households were found to have been victims of crop theft within three days. The village has now formed a joint defense with nearby villages, dividing boundaries for joint guarding. Local opium smokers and idlers have also been placed under control and forced to work. In order to promote universal land plowing this autumn, the Suiyuan Provincial Government decided on August 22 to issue loans for 1,000 head of draft cattle, and instructed all localities to vigorously organize idle funds to purchase draft cattle, striving to purchase 1,500 head of draft cattle to solve the shortage of draft cattle in the autumn plowing of various counties; the decision specifically proposed to concretely solve the difficulties of revolutionary martyrs, military personnel, and workers' families. In order to prevent the occurrence of wheat yellowing and black rust diseases next year, the Taiyuan Municipal People's Government decided to mobilize farmers in various counties to carry out wheat seed disinfection and soaking before autumn sowing, and organized a promotion team of more than 40 people to go to various special districts to cooperate with agricultural technicians from each special commissioner's office to guide farmers in disinfection and soaking separately. The municipal government has determined that the area of land disinfected and soaked in the entire region is 1,691,000 mu, to ensure a bumper wheat harvest next year.

　　华北各地党政领导机关
  　全力组织秋收
    应注意组织劳力、作好选种、看秋、护秋等工作。
    【本报综合讯】炎夏已过，时届初秋，农民一年辛勤劳动的果实就要收获了。伴随秋收而来的，是秋耕与秋种。这是一个农事繁忙的季节。华北各地党政领导机关，现正全力组织农民，进行“三秋”（秋收秋耕秋种）的准备工作。平原日报日前以“加强秋季工作，贯彻增产”为题发表社论，指出：要作好秋收工作，必须首先加强目前防汛工作，积极领导群众修疏水道与水洼地，以减少秋苗被淹的损失。同时应组织群众看青，防止不法分子的偷盗与破坏，在受灾区，应组织群众生产节约自救，组织群众种晚菜备荒；合作社应全力帮助群众解决种籽问题。河北省人民政府也于八月下旬发出“三秋”指示，要求各地一面及时收秋，一面耕地送粪准备种麦。指示称：为了克服这样双方下手，劳力畜力所遇到的必然困难，因此必须广泛发动妇女儿童参加秋收，并根据农活的需要与群众的自愿，在两利原则下，进行互助拨工。指示并号召各地普遍发动农民进行选种，除农场、供销社等部门收换一部优良品种外，最重要的是广泛组织群众选择抗旱、抗风、抗虫的及产量大的优良种籽。此外，对已公布的谁种谁收谁负担的政策，必须贯澈执行。中共察哈尔省委会、察哈尔人民政府亦先后发出指示，号召全省集中力量，加强领导，发动广大群众参加秋收秋耕运动。注意加强护秋，制止破坏分子活动。省政府的指示中着重提出收割要及时，应该熟一片、割一片，以免遭受风霜冻等灾的损害。现该省宣化县沙子岭等区已组成护秋委员会，并规定出具体护秋办法。如组织民兵轮流看青，加强公安工作，发动群众检举和监视偷盗分子等。万全县一区高庙堡村，在三天内发现十户被盗青事件，现该村已与附近各村组成民兵联防，分界联络看守。各村烟民、二流子也被管制起来，并强制他们进行劳动。绥远省政府为推动今秋普遍翻地，特于八月二十二日决定发放一千条耕牛的贷款，并指示各地要大力组织游资购买耕牛，争取买到一千五百条耕牛，以解决各县秋翻地中的耕牛困难；该决定特别提出要具体解决烈、军、工属的困难。太原市人民政府为防止明年小麦黄疸、黑疸病发生，决定在秋种前，发动各县农民进行麦种消毒浸种工作，并组织了四十余人的推广大队，出发到各专区，配合各专署农业技术人员，分别指导农民消毒侵种。该市府确定全区消毒浸种的土地为一百六十九万一千亩，以保证明年小麦丰收。
