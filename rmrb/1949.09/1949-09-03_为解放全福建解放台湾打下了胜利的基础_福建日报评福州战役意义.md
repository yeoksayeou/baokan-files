Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, September 2nd: This newspaper, *Fujian Daily*, commented on the significance of the victory of the Fuzhou Campaign, stating: The Fuzhou Campaign not only liberated Fuzhou and its surrounding areas, achieving the brilliant result of annihilating 50,000 enemy troops, but also laid a victorious foundation for the future liberation of all of Fujian and the liberation of Taiwan. The victory of the Fuzhou Campaign has shattered the Chiang bandit gang's dream of defending Fujian (mainly Fuzhou and Xiamen) in an attempt to prolong their existence, and has completely exposed Taiwan, the nest and air-sea base where the remaining reactionary forces of the Kuomintang bandit gang can make a final struggle and intrude into our coastal cities, to the spearhead of the People's Liberation Army's advance. The editorial further pointed out: The victory of the Fuzhou Campaign has increased the experience of large corps in mountain operations and greatly enhanced the confidence of our Fujian military and civilians in victory, proving that our powerful People's Liberation Army, with the assistance of the heroic local guerrillas and the people, can overcome all difficulties. This time, the People's Liberation Army marched into Fujian, advancing thousands of miles, passing through high mountains and narrow paths. Cadres and soldiers walked together, letting horses carry baggage and food. Each soldier carried heavy ammunition and weapons, as well as more than five days' worth of food and other daily necessities, chasing the enemy in the blazing sun. In some mountainous areas, because artillery vehicles could not pass, the soldiers disassembled them and carried them on their shoulders. This spirit of hard struggle of the People's Liberation Army is one of the main reasons for this victory. Finally, the editorial called on all commanders and fighters to make persistent efforts, strengthen political education, strengthen military discipline, further master new combat methods and combat techniques, and more bravely pursue the enemy. It also called on the people in the liberated areas and the areas to be liberated to actively support the People's Liberation Army, contributing their strength and money, implementing fair and reasonable burdens, eliminating bandits and secret agents, consolidating public security, repairing bridges and roads, and assisting the army's movement, to strive for the liberation of Xiamen, the liberation of all of Fujian, and the liberation of Taiwan!

　　为解放全福建解放台湾打下了胜利的基础
  　福建日报评福州战役意义
    【新华社福州二日电】此间福建日报评福州战役胜利的意义称：福州战役不仅解放了福州及其周围广大地区，获得歼敌五万的辉煌战果，而且为今后解放全福建、解放台湾打下了胜利的基础。福州战役的胜利，已打破了蒋匪防守福建（主要是福州、厦门），企图苟延残喘的迷梦，并使国民党匪帮残余反动力量借以作为最后挣扎的巢穴与进扰我沿海城市的海空基地台湾完全暴露在解放军的进军矛头之下。社论复指出：福州战役的胜利，增加了大兵团在山区作战经验，大大提高了我福建军民的胜利信心，证明了我强大的解放军在英勇的地方游击队和人民协助下，是可以克服一切困难的。此次解放军挺进福建，千里进军，通过高山峻岭、羊肠小道，干部、战士一起步行，让马匹驮载辎重、粮食，每个战士除携带沉重的弹药武器外，还要背五天以上的粮食及其他日用品，在炎天烈日下追击敌人，在好些山区，因为炮车不能通过，战士们就把它拆下来扛着走，人民解放军这种艰苦奋斗的精神是获得这次胜利的主要原因之一。最后社论号召全体指战员再接再厉，加强政治教育，加强军事纪律，进一步掌握新的作战方法与作战技术，更勇猛地追击敌人；已解放地区及待解放区的人民积极支援人民解放军，有力出力，有钱出钱，实行公平合理负担，肃清土匪特务，巩固治安，修桥补路，协助军队运动，为解放厦门解放全福建及解放台湾而奋斗！
