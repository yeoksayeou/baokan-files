　　Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 22nd—The Chinese delegation headed by Lin Qiangyun, which attended the Second Congress of the World Federation of Trade Unions, returned to Beiping by train at 7:00 PM today. Zhu Xuefan and Liu Ningyi, vice-chairmen of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and more than 500 representatives from Beiping trade unions welcomed them at the station. In his welcoming speech, Vice-Chairman Zhu Xuefan pointed out: The return of the delegation is very significant at a time when the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is opening and the People's Republic of China is about to be born. The Second Congress of the World Federation of Trade Unions, which the delegation attended, crushed the conspiracy of the American and British imperialists to split the unity of the world working class through united action. Our Chinese working class must also unite better and unite with all democratic strata to consolidate our people's democratic power, strive to produce and support the front lines, and build a new China. Lin Qiangyun of the delegation said in his reply: The delegation received a warm welcome from the working-class brothers of various countries during this trip abroad. Workers from various countries, especially those from the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries, are very concerned about the struggle of our working class and our people against domestic and foreign reactionaries, and expressed their willingness to do everything they can to help us overcome the difficulties in the construction of the new China. We believe that the diligence and tireless efforts of our people, coupled with the help of the people of the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries, will surely be able to build a prosperous and strong country.
