　　[Special dispatch from our correspondent in Harbin, 28th] Over ten thousand people from all walks of life in Harbin welcomed the Soviet delegation, which came to participate in the grand ceremony celebrating the establishment of the Chinese Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, with immense jubilation and respect. The delegation, headed by the famous Soviet writer Fadeyev, included 43 outstanding Soviet writers and artists. When the special train carrying the Soviet delegation arrived at Harbin Station at 6:00 PM, Zhang Ce, Secretary of the Songjiang Provincial Committee of the CPC, and Mayor Rao Bin immediately stepped forward to greet them. After a short rest in the station's reception room, a grand welcome meeting was held. The venue was set up in the square in front of the station, facing the magnificent Red Army Memorial Tower. A large five-pointed star, exquisitely crafted from countless red lights, hung high on the tower, sparkling brightly in the night, attracting attention. Huge portraits of the leaders of China and the Soviet Union were erected on the stage, symbolizing the friendship and unity between the people of the two countries. At 6:20 PM, the meeting began with the melodious strains of the Soviet national anthem. A dozen children dressed in colorful costumes ran to the Soviet delegation to present flowers. Mayor Rao Bin then stepped to the microphone to deliver a welcoming speech, emphasizing that China's revolution would not have achieved today's victory without the assistance of peace-loving people around the world, especially the Soviet people. He called on all sectors of Harbin to earnestly learn from the Soviet spirit of internationalism and their experience in nation-building. Subsequently, Professor Gerasimov, the director of the famous film "The Young Guard," spoke on behalf of the Soviet delegation, stating that the Soviet people expressed their heartfelt congratulations on the victory of the Chinese people, and that Soviet scientists and literary workers were willing to sincerely give advanced science and culture to their Chinese friends, enhance the friendship between China and the Soviet Union, and, on behalf of the Soviet people, offer blessings to the great leader Mao Zedong, who heroically leads the Chinese people forward. His speech was often drowned out by warm applause, and the audience repeatedly shouted "Long live Stalin!" to express their gratitude. The meeting was held in a very warm, harmonious, and solemn atmosphere throughout. Near the end of the meeting, a sudden autumn rain drenched the outerwear of the attendees, but everyone stood firm until they watched the Soviet delegation board the cars and depart for their accommodations before lining up to return.

    【本报哈尔滨二十八日专电】哈市各界万余人以极大的狂欢与敬意，欢迎为祝贺中国中苏友好协会成立盛典赶来参加的苏联代表团。该团系以苏联名作家法捷耶夫为首，包括了苏联出色的文学家，艺术家等共四十三人。当苏代表团所乘专车于下午六时抵哈市车站时，中共松江省委书记张策和市长饶斌即趋前迎迓。在车站休息室内稍事休息，即举行盛大的欢迎会，会场设在车站前广场，面对着雄伟的红军纪念塔，塔身高悬着由无数红灯精制的大五角星，在夜幕中明晃的闪烁着，吸人注目，台上竖立着中苏两国领袖底巨幅画像，象征着中苏两国人民的友谊和团结。六时二十分，大会在奏苏联国歌的悠扬乐声中开始，十几个身着彩衣的儿童飞跑到苏联代表团前献花甫毕，饶斌市长即走到麦克风前致欢迎词，他强调称：中国的革命，如果没有全世界爱好和平的人民，特别是苏联人民的援助，不会达到今天的胜利。并号召哈市各界认真学习苏联的国际主义的精神与建国的经验。旋即由苏联代表格那塞莫夫教授名影片青年近卫军的导演者致词，略谓苏联人民对中国人民的胜利表示衷心的庆祝，苏联的科学和文学工作者们都愿赤诚的把先进的科学文化赠给中国的朋友，增强中苏两国的友谊，并代表苏联人民为英勇的领导中国人民前进的伟大领袖毛泽东而祝福，他的讲话常淹没在热烈的掌声中，听众并连续高呼斯大林万岁以致谢意。会议始终是在十分热烈融洽和肃穆的空气中，临散会前，忽然来一阵秋雨，淋湿了到会群众底外衣，全场都稳立不动，直到欢送着苏联代表团都登上汽车往招待地点出发后始列队归回。（附图片）    法捷耶夫
