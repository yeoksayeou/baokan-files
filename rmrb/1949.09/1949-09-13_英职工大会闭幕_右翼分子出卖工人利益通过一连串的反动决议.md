Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 12th: Bridlington dispatch: The 81st British Trades Union Congress, which opened here on September 4th, closed on the 9th. Under the manipulation of right-wing leaders, the congress continued to pass a series of resolutions on the 8th and 9th, betraying the interests of the British working class. At the meeting on the 8th, the General Council, represented by Trades Union Congress General Secretary Vincent Tewson, proposed a motion to support the government's wage freeze policy. In order to force the congress to pass this proposal, Tewson fabricated a set of reasons, saying that only by freezing wages can full employment be maintained and living standards preserved. Trades Union Congress Executive Committee member and General Secretary of the Transport and General Workers' Union, Arthur Deakin, came out to support Tewson, emphasizing the necessity of freezing wages and demanding that workers work hard to increase profits for capitalists. At the meeting, Electrical Trades Union General Secretary Bertram Batty proposed requiring the regulation of profits, pointing out that wages could be increased as long as the profits of big capital were cut, while current wages were far from enough to maintain a reasonable standard of living for workers. However, the congress still passed the General Council's proposal. At the meeting on the same day, Manchester Rubber Workers' Union leader Eastwood proposed nationalizing the rubber industry, which was monopolized by Imperial Chemical Industries Trust and Dunlop Rubber Company, but this proposal was opposed by the General Council, represented by Evans, and was rejected. At the meeting on the 9th, left-wing representatives put forward a motion demanding that the government stop the purge of civil servants. Although this proposal was still rejected, it caused a fierce debate at the congress. When Arthur Deakin rose to speak, boos of contempt rang out from the representatives. The congress closed after electing the current British Trades Union Congress representative to the International Labour Office, Bullock, to succeed Lawther as Chairman of the General Council for this year.

　　英职工大会闭幕
　  右翼分子出卖工人利益通过一连串的反动决议
    【新华社北平十二日电】布里德林顿讯：九月四日在此间开幕的英国职工大会八十一届大会，已于九日闭幕。在右翼领导分子操纵下，大会于八、九两日继续通过一连串出卖英国工人阶级利益的决议。在八日会议上，最高委员会以职工大会总书记陶逊为代表，提出支持政府冻结工资政策的议案。为了强使大会通过这一提案，陶逊编造了大套理由，说什么只有冻结工资，才能维持充分就业和保持生活水平。职工大会执委、运输及各业工人工会总书记狄金出而支持陶逊，强调冻结工资的必要，并要求工人拼命为资本家增加利润而生产。会上电气工会总书记白塞提议要求管制利润，指出只要削减大资本的利润即可以提高工资，而目前的工资却远不足维持工人的合理生活水准。但是大会竟仍然通过了最高委员会的提案。同日会议上，曼澈斯特橡胶工人工会领袖伊斯特伍德，提议把为帝国化学工业托辣斯与邓禄普橡胶公司的垄断的橡胶工业收归国有，但是这一提案遭到以伊凡斯为代表的最高委员会的反对，并被否决。九日会议上，左翼代表提出议案，要求政府停止清洗公务员的行动，这一提案虽仍遭否决，但在这大会上曾引起了激烈的争辩，当狄金起立发言时，代表中响起轻蔑他的嘘声。大会在选出现任国际劳工局英国职工大会代表蒲洛克继劳瑟为本年度最高委员会主席后闭幕。
