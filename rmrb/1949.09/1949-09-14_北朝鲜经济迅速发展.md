　　North Korea's economy has shown remarkable success in the past two years. One of the greatest democratic reforms completed by the People's Government to ensure the economic recovery of North Korea was the complete nationalization of industry, transportation, and banks formerly owned by Japanese monopoly capitalists and Korean traitors. This reform, implemented by the Provisional People's Committee on August 10, 1946, has shown the most beneficial effects on the development of the Korean national economy. It transferred the key sectors of industry to the people, making them a source of strength for the people's democratic system and the continuous improvement of people's living standards. It also created a good opportunity for the people to plan production themselves and to ensure the rapid development of industry and transportation.

　　The damage inflicted on industry and transportation by the Japanese on the eve of their surrender made the development and improvement of these two sectors of the national economy doubly difficult. However, the creativity of the liberated people is infinite. Thanks to the enthusiastic efforts of the people and all the measures taken by the People's Committee, 822 of the 1,034 state-owned enterprises had resumed work by January 1947. The total industrial output of North Korea in 1947 almost doubled compared to the previous year, and the average productivity of workers increased by almost one and a half times. The development of light industry is particularly gratifying. Now, the People's Democratic Government has made the mass production of consumer goods and the continuous improvement of people's living standards one of its basic goals.

　　One of the main goals of the national economic plan is to enable North Korea, which has always relied on Japan in the past, to achieve economic independence and autonomy. More than 70 kinds of items that used to be purchased from Japan were already produced by North Korean industrial enterprises themselves last year. This even includes the most complex iron rolling, non-ferrous metal equipment, iron cutting machines, and current transformers.

　　By 1948, North Korea was already facing a more arduous task: to increase production and open up 100 new production projects (including mining industry tools, wires, motors, storage batteries, and agricultural machinery). The success of the working people of North Korea in completing the 1948 plan makes us confident that the above tasks will also be completed. The amazing vitality of the People's Democratic regime is the most powerful guarantee.

### 北朝鲜经济迅速发展

　　北朝鲜经济迅速发展
    过去两年中，北朝鲜国民经济已经表现出显著的成功。人民政府所完成的保证北鲜经济复兴的最大民主改革之一是：把从前属于日本独占资本家和鲜奸所有的工业、交通、运输，和银行完全收归国有。临时人民委员会于一九四六年八月十日所实行的这项改革，对于朝鲜国民经济的发展，显示出最有利的效果。它把工业的锁钥部门移交给人民，使它们成为人民民主制度以及人民生活水准不断提高的力量的源泉。并且造成了由人民自己来计划生产，来保证工业和交通运输迅速发展的一个良机。
    日本人在投降前夜对工业及交通运输方面所加的破坏，使国民经济该两部门的发展和提高，加倍繁难。但是，被解放了的人民的创造力是无穷的。感谢人民的热烈努力以及人民委员会所采取的一切措施，收归国营的一千零三十四个企业之中，有八百二十二个到一九四七年一月业已复工。一九四七年全北朝鲜的工业总生产量比较上一年几乎增加到两倍半，而工人的平均生产力几乎增加到一倍半之多。轻工业的发展，尤其使人满意。现在，人民民主政府已经把大量生产消费品和不断提高人民生活程度作为其基本目标之一。
    国民经济计划的主要目标之一，在于使过去一贯依靠着日本的北鲜，获得经济上的独立自主，有七十多种以前由日本购进的东西，在去年一年中，已经由北鲜的工业企业自己来生产。这里面甚至于更包含着最复杂的辗铁、非铁金属的装备，截铁机以及电流变压器等。
    到一九四八年，北朝鲜已经面临到一项更艰巨的工作。那就是增强生产和开辟一百种新的生产项目（其中包括采矿工业用具，电线，电动机，蓄电器和农业机器），北朝鲜的劳动人民，在完成一九四八年计划中获得的成功，使我们确信上述各项任务也一定会完成的。人民民主政权的惊人活力就是一个最有力的保证。
