　　Taiyuan Public Enterprises
  　Adjust Employee Salaries Merge Similar Factories
  　Formulate Production Plans for August to December
    [Taiyuan Electricity] Since mid-July, various public enterprises in Taiyuan have been busy adjusting salaries, reorganizing institutions, and formulating plans to further streamline production. During the Yan Xishan bandit regime, the salary system in Taiyuan factories was extremely unreasonable, which became an obstacle to restoring production after liberation. To solve this problem, the Taiyuan Military Control Commission established a Salary Research Committee, and in mid-June formulated a "Draft Salary Method for Employees of Public Factories." The Electricity Company was used as a key pilot project. After obtaining a salary assessment method that combined the new salary standards with specific conditions, the Industrial Takeover Team officially conveyed and deployed this on July 9th to the heads of various factories. Factories began salary assessments around the 15th of the month. This salary assessment was an adjustment based on the original, rather than a complete overhaul. Based on the experience of the Electricity Company, each factory conducted publicity and education for employees for a long period of time before the assessment, explaining not only the purpose and standards of the assessment, but also criticizing and explaining possible tendencies (such as egalitarianism, excessive demands, sectarianism, and not prioritizing technology), guiding employees to conduct democratic deliberation and establish a salary assessment committee to repeatedly discuss new salary standards, and continuing to prevent and overcome various tendencies during the assessment process. To strengthen leadership, the Industrial Takeover Team, in conjunction with the Taiyuan Office of the North China Federation of Trade Unions, established a Salary Review Committee to specifically review the salaries of cadres above the section chief level in each factory, the new salary standards, and the average number of final salaries, so as to achieve balance and rationality between factories. Currently, the Printing Company, Cement Plant, and other units have all completed this work. With the exception of the Iron and Steel Company, Textile Company, and Industrial and Mining Construction Company, other companies and factories will be able to complete this by the end of August. After the salary assessment, production backbones such as technical personnel, skilled workers, and experienced workers received the largest increases, except for those whose salaries were unreasonably high and should be lowered. Taking the Cement Plant as an example, the average salary of the entire factory increased by 26% compared to May, the average salary of technical personnel increased by 32%, the average salary of management personnel increased by 23%, and the average salary of logistics personnel increased by 5.91%. Further increases will continue as production recovers.
    The reorganization of institutions is being carried out simultaneously with the salary assessment. In the past, the industrial structure under the Yan Xishan bandit regime had large, overstaffed upper-level agencies, while similar factories below were not connected or coordinated with each other, forming a top-heavy structure that severely restricted business. In view of this, the Military Control Commission has changed the Industrial Takeover Team to the Public Light and Heavy Industry Management Office, and has merged related factories into thirteen companies, including Iron and Steel, Flour, Electricity, Industrial Chemistry, Printing, Industrial and Mining Construction, Textile, Coal Mine, Machinery, Tobacco, Matches, and Paper, as well as the Cement and Leather factories, and factories such as the Northwest Chemical Plant, Manufacturing Plant, and Repair Plant. The various companies have now been established one after another. The production institutions left by the Yan Xishan bandit regime have become more scientific after this rectification, but the staffing of the various companies does not fully meet the requirements of simplification and needs to be further rectified in the future.
    Currently, each company has formulated production plans from August to the end of the year based on the ordering and sales situation in various regions and the needs of construction and society, continuing to improve the quantity and quality of products and expand production.

　　太原各公营企业
  　调整职工薪资  合并同类工厂
  　订出八至十二月份生产计划
    【太原电】七月中旬以来，太原公营企业各厂，均忙于调整薪资，改组机构，制订计划，以使生产更走向正规。阎匪统治时期，太原各厂薪资制度极不合理。解放后成为恢复生产的障碍。太原军管会为解决这一问题，特成立工资研究委员会，并于六月中旬制订“公营工厂职工薪资办法草案”，以电力公司为重点，先行试评，获得以新工资标准结合具体条件的评资办法后，工业接管组即在七月九日召集各厂负责人正式传达布置。于十五日前后各厂开始评资。此次评资仍系在原有基础上进行调整，而非整个打乱重评。各厂根据电力公司经验，评资前均以较长时间对职工进行宣传教育，不仅讲明评资的目的和标准，而且针对可能发生的倾向（如平均主义、过高要求，小宗派、不以技术为主等）作批评解释，引导职工展开民主酝酿，成立评资委员会，反复讨论新工资标准，并在评资过程中继续防止与克服各种倾向。为加强领导，工业接管组又协同华北职工总会太原办事处，成立薪资审核委员会，专门负责审核各厂科长以上干部的薪资、新工资标准及最后工资的平均数，使厂与厂之间也做到平衡、合理。现印刷公司、洋灰厂等单位已全部结束，除钢铁公司，纺织公司，工矿建设公司外，其他各公司各厂至八月底亦均可完成。评资后除过去不合理应予降低者外，技术人员、技术工人、熟练工人等生产骨干提高得最多。以洋灰厂为例：全厂平均工资较五月份增加百分之二十六，技术人员平均增加百分之三十二，管理人员平均增加百分之二十三，勤杂人员平均增加百分之五点九一。今后随着生产的恢复将继续提高。
    改组机构是与评资同时进行的。以往阎匪的工业机构，上边机关庞大，冗员很多；下边同类的各厂却互不联系配合，形成头重脚轻，业务上很受限制。军管会有鉴于此，已将工业接管组改为公营轻重工业管理处，分别将有关工厂合并为钢铁、面粉、电力、工业化学、印刷、工矿建设、纺织、煤矿、机器、烟草、火柴、造纸等十三个公司及洋灰、皮革两厂，及西北化学厂、制造厂、修造等厂，现各公司已陆续成立。阎匪遗留下来的生产机构经此次整顿已比较科学化，但各公司编制尚不完全符合精简要求，有待今后继续整顿。
    现各公司根据各地订货及销售情况，根据建设与社会的需要，已订出八月至年底的生产计划，继续提高产品的数量与质量，扩大生产。
