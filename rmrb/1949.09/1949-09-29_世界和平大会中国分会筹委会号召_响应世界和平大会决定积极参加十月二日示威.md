Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 28th: The Preparatory Committee of the Chinese Branch of the World Peace Congress, in order to call on all people's organizations and compatriots from all walks of life across the country to enthusiastically respond to the decision of the World Peace Congress and actively participate in the October 2nd International Day of Peace demonstration, issued the following announcement:
    All people's organizations and compatriots from all walks of life across the country:
    The World Peace Congress warned the people of all countries: Peace is in danger. American imperialism and its servants are following in Hitler's footsteps, desperately pursuing and creating new wars of aggression. The "North Atlantic Treaty" and the so-called "Pacific Alliance" that is being rushed into production are a replica of the 1936 German-Japanese-Italian "Anti-Comintern Pact." Its purpose is to attempt to attack the Soviet Union, attack the new China and all people's democratic countries. American imperialists are striving to expand their armaments, expand their network of military bases, support the remnants of German and Japanese fascism, and plot to create a peace treaty with Japan that violates the Potsdam Agreement or indefinitely delay the peace treaty with Japan, support reactionaries in various countries, and carry out various sabotage and disruptive activities against the cause of people's democracy and peace, in order to achieve their sinister goals. However, the strength of the world's democratic and peace camp, led by the Soviet Union, has become unprecedentedly strong and has surpassed the strength of the aggressive group. The World Peace Congresses in Paris and Prague in April of this year organized this force on a global scale. The peace movement in all countries of the world is developing vigorously. In particular, the great achievements of the Soviet Union's socialist construction, the rapid progress of construction in the new democratic countries of Eastern Europe, and the great victory of the Chinese people have greatly strengthened and consolidated the position of the world's democratic peace, and made the provocations of the warmongers more difficult. As long as the people of the world continue to be vigilant, unite and fight, the danger of war can be defeated.
    The Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress recently issued a call, requesting the democratic and peaceful forces of the world to launch a more resolute and wider range of actions, and decided to designate October 2nd as the International Day of Struggle for Peace, with peace forces around the world acting together to hold rallies and demonstrations to strive for lasting peace and oppose the danger of war, in order to further advance the world people's peace movement.
    The Chinese people have always stood on the side of the world's people's peace and democratic camp. The victory of the Chinese people's liberation movement and the establishment of the People's Republic of China are a great contribution to the world's people's peace movement. There is no doubt that the new China will play an important role in world affairs, especially in Far Eastern affairs, and must actively participate in the struggle for world peace. Therefore, we hope that people's organizations and compatriots from all walks of life across the country will enthusiastically respond to the call of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress. All people's organizations and compatriots from all walks of life who support this call should hold grand rallies and parades on October 2nd to express the Chinese people's firm determination to defend world peace and oppose a new world war of aggression. We will also formally establish the Chinese Branch of the World Peace Congress in Beijing on the same day, as a general organization to unify the leadership and connect all parts of the country to fight for lasting world peace.
    We shout:
    Oppose the conspiracy of US and British imperialism to create a new war of aggression!
    Oppose the US and British imperialism's tool of aggression, the "North Atlantic Treaty" and the "Pacific Alliance"!
    Oppose US imperialism supporting Japanese fascism to re-invade China!
    Immediately convene a four-power conference on the Japanese peace treaty with the participation of the People's Republic of China!
    Unite with countries, nations, and people in the world who treat us equally, and fight to defend the independence and autonomy of all nations and strengthen international friendship and cooperation!
    People of the world, unite to oppose a new war of aggression and strive for lasting world peace!
    Long live the People's Republic of China, the powerful fortress of world peace!
    Long live the Soviet Union, the leader of the world's democratic peace camp!
    Long live the World Peace Congress!
    Long live people's democracy and lasting peace!

　　世界和平大会中国分会筹委会号召
    响应世界和平大会决定积极参加十月二日示威
    【新华社北京二十八日电】世界拥护和平大会中国分会筹备委员会，为号召全国各人民团体和各界同胞热烈响应世界拥护和平大会的决定，积极参加十月二日国际和平日的示威，发出通告如下：全国各人民团体和各界同胞们：
    世界拥护和平大会向各国人民发出警告：和平是在危险中，美帝国主义及其仆从们，正步着希特勒的后尘，在拼命地追求和制造新的侵略战争。“北大西洋公约”，和正在赶制中的所谓“太平洋联盟”，便是一九三六年德日意“反共公约”的翻版。其目的，是企图进攻苏联，进攻新中国和一切人民民主国家。美国帝国主义者努力扩张军备，扩张军事基地网，扶植德日法西斯残余势力，阴谋制造违反波茨坦协定的对日和约或无限期拖延对日和约，支持各国的反动派，对人民民主和平事业进行各种破坏捣乱活动，以期达到他们的罪恶的目的。但是，以苏联为首的世界民主和平阵营的力量，已经空前强大，并已经超过了侵略集团的力量。本年四月间的巴黎和布拉格的世界拥护和平大会，把这种力量在全世界的规模上组织起来了。全世界各国的和平运动正在汹涌澎湃地发展着。特别是苏联社会主义建设的伟大成就，东欧各新民主国家建设的突飞猛进，以及中国人民的伟大胜利，大大地加强和巩固了世界民主和平的阵地，并使战争贩子们的挑衅更加困难。只要世界人民继续保持警惕，团结奋斗，战争的危险是可以被击败的。
    世界拥护和平大会常设委员会最近发出号召，要求全世界民主和平力量展开更坚决更广泛的行动，并决定十月二日为国际和平斗争日，全世界和平力量一致行动起来，举行争取持久和平及反对战争危险的集会和示威游行，以便把世界人民的和平运动更向前推进一步。
    中国人民向来是站在世界人民和平民主阵营一方面的，中国人民解放运动的胜利和中华人民共和国的成立，是对于世界人民和平运动的一个伟大贡献。毫无疑问，新中国即将在世界事务尤其是远东事务中起重要的作用，对于世界和平斗争尤须积极参加。因此，我们希望全国人民团体和各界同胞热烈响应世界拥护和平大会常设委员会的号召。凡是赞助这一号召的人民团体和各界同胞，在十月二日应举行盛大的集会游行，来表示中国人民保卫世界和平、反对世界新的侵略战争的坚强决心。我们并将在同一天在北京正式成立世界拥护和平大会中国分会，作为统一领导和联系全国各地为争取世界持久和平而斗争的总机构。
    我们高呼：
    反对美英帝国主义制造新侵略战争的阴谋！
    反对美英帝国主义的侵略工具“北大西洋公约”和“太平洋联盟”！
    反对美帝国主义扶植日本法西斯重新侵略中国！
    立即召开有中华人民共和国参加的四强对日和约会议！
    联合世界上以平等待我之国家、民族和人民，为保卫各民族的独立自主，加强国际友谊合作而斗争！
    全世界人民团结起来，反对新的侵略战争，争取世界持久和平！
    世界和平的强大堡垒中华人民共和国万岁！
    世界和平民主阵营的领导者苏联万岁！
    世界拥护和平大会万岁！
    人民民主与持久和平万岁！
