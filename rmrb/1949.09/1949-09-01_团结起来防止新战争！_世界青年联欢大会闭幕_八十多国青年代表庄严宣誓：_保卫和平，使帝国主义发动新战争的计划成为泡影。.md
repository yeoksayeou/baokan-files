　　Unite to Prevent New Wars!
  　World Youth Festival Concludes
  　Youth Representatives from Over Eighty Countries Solemnly Swear:
  　Defend Peace and Thwart Imperialist Plans to Launch New Wars.
    【Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, August 31st】Budapest Dispatch: The World Youth and Student Festival concluded on the 28th after two weeks of meetings. Before the closing ceremony, youth representatives from over eighty countries and tens of thousands of working people from Budapest held a grand demonstration. Leading the way were flag bearers holding the flags of over eighty countries. Following them was a contingent of Soviet youth carrying a giant statue of Stalin. Flags and banners were held high, with banners reading: "Youth Unite! March towards a consolidated peace, democracy, national independence, and a bright future! Down with the imperialist warmongers! Glory to the bastion of peace! - The Soviet Union! Long live the great Stalin, teacher of all working people!" The demonstrators poured into Budapest's largest square, Heroes' Square, where a rally of over 250,000 people was held.
    The meeting was presided over by the chairman of the Hungarian People's Youth League, Comrade Nong. The chairman of the World Student Union, Comrade Grohman, spoke first, pointing out that the World Youth Festival, as a powerful demonstration of young people fighting for peace, had achieved its goal. The Secretary of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League, Mikhailov, said: The Second World Youth Festival vividly demonstrates the strength of democratic youth, who are firmly united to fight for the cause of peace, democracy, and freedom. The festival is a blow to the American and British warmongers and their accomplices. The festival shows the success achieved by the youth of the New Democratic countries, who stand firmly under the banner of socialism. The festival demonstrates the growth of the democratic youth forces in capitalist countries. They resolutely resist the conspiracies of the reactionaries and fight for peace, democracy, and friendship between countries. The festival declares its strong support for the youth of colonial and dependent countries who are bravely fighting for the glory and freedom of their motherlands. The festival proves the love of all those who cherish democracy and peace for the Soviet Union. The festival shows how deeply Stalin is loved and respected by all progressive mankind. Inspired by Lenin and Stalin, the Soviet youth always advance as the vanguard of democratic youth worldwide. We are inspired by our tomorrow, the unshakable destiny of our future. This destiny belongs to the forces of democracy. We must dedicate our strength and energy to fight for peace and friendship between countries, for a better future for youth, and we must win.
    Rakosi calls for:
    Supporting peace and intensifying the struggle
    The next speaker was the General Secretary of the Hungarian Workers' Party, Rakosi. He said: The Second Youth Festival faces a task: to resolutely support lasting peace and intensify the struggle against the Western imperialists who are sharpening their knives. The delegations have exchanged experiences and are ready to further fight for the great cause of defending and strengthening peace.
    Then, the chairman of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, Comrade Boisson, led the participants in the festival in taking an oath. In memory of the heroes who bravely sacrificed themselves for the freedom of the people, all flags were lowered slightly and then slowly raised, and silence reigned over the entire square for a moment. The participants of the festival solemnly swore: to defend peace, to fight against imperialism attempting to launch new wars, and to unremittingly carry out the just struggle for the national independence, rights, and happiness of all peoples. All the attendees of the conference repeated three times after Comrade Boisson: "We swear, we swear, we swear!"
    Finally, the conference ended in the singing of the "Song of Democratic Youth."
    Full text of the oath
    【Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, August 31st】Budapest Dispatch: The full text of the oath of the World Democratic Youth and Student Festival is as follows:
    "We, the representatives of democratic youth gathered from all over the world at the World Democratic Youth and Student Festival, hereby express our indomitable will and desire: to live happily in a world that will never know poverty, fear, and war. We are deeply convinced that our strength, united with the strength of all the peoples of the world, will surely create this new life. Therefore, in the name of millions of young people of all races and beliefs, we solemnly swear: to defend peace and thwart the imperialist plans to launch new wars. We swear to fight to improve the living conditions of the people. Because our many brothers and sisters sacrificed their lives in the anti-fascist struggle, the world has gained true democracy and peace. We call on all youth – the hope of all people in the world – to unite to prevent new wars. We swear to fight for the sacred cause of peace and happiness until victory."

    【新华社北平三十一日电】布达佩斯讯：世界青年与学生联欢大会在开会两周后，已于二十八日宣告结束。闭幕会之前，大会八十多国青年代表们和成千成万的匈京劳动人民，在布达佩斯举行了盛大的示威游行。走在最前面的是高举着八十多国国旗的旗手。接着就是抬着斯大林巨像的苏联青年的队伍。国旗和长幅被高高地举着，长幅上写着：“青年们团结起来！为巩固的和平、民主、民族独立、和美好的将来迈进！打倒帝国主义战争贩子！光荣归于和平的堡垒！——苏联！全体劳动人民的导师——伟大的斯大林万岁！”游行示威者涌入布达佩斯最大的广场——英雄广场，在那里举行了二十五万多人的集会。
    大会由匈牙利人民青年联盟主席浓氏主持开会。世界学联主席格罗曼首先发言指出：作为年青人为和平而斗争的有力示威的世界青年联欢大会，已达到了目的。苏联共产主义青年团书记米哈伊洛夫说：第二届世界青年联欢大会生动地证明了：坚牢地团结起来为和平、民主与自由的事业而斗争的民主青年，有着多么强大的力量。联欢大会是对美英战争贩子及其同谋者的打击。联欢大会显示出新民主国家的青年所获得的成功，他们坚定地站在社会主义旗帜底下。联欢大会显示着资本主义国家的民主青年力量的成长。他们坚持抵抗反动派的阴谋，并为和平、民主与各国间友谊而进行斗争。联欢大会宣告热烈支持为争取祖国的光荣与自由而英勇斗争的殖民地与附属国的青年。联欢大会证明了一切爱护民主与和平利益的人对苏联的热爱。联欢大会显示出斯大林享有着一切进步人类多么深挚的热爱与尊敬。被列宁和斯大林感召的苏联青年总是作为全世界民主青年的先锋向前迈进。我们被我们的明天、我们的未来的不可摇撼的命运所鼓舞着。这命运是属于民主力量的。我们要奉献我们的力量与精力，去为和平与各国间的友谊，为青年更美好的未来而斗争，并且要获得胜利。
    拉科西号召
    拥护和平加紧斗争
    继起演说的，是匈牙利工人党总书记拉科西。他说：第二届青年联欢大会面临着一个任务：坚决拥护持久和平，并加紧对磨刀霍霍的西方帝国主义者进行斗争。各代表团已交换了经验，并且已准备好进一步为保卫并加强和平的伟大事业而斗争。
    继由世界青联主席鲍埃逊领导联欢大会的参加者宣誓。为了纪念那些为争取人民的自由而英勇牺牲的英雄们，所有旗帜都稍稍下降，又徐徐升起，顷刻之间静默统治了整个广场。联欢会的参加者庄严地宣誓：誓必拥护和平，对企图发动新战争的帝国主义进行斗争，誓为各国人民的民族独立、权利与幸福而毫不松懈地进行正义的斗争。出席大会的全体会众，都跟着鲍埃逊重复三次：“我们宣誓，我们宣誓，我们宣誓！”
    最后大会在民主青年歌的歌声中结束。
    誓词全文
    【新华社北平三十一日电】布达佩斯讯：世界民主青年与学生联欢大会誓词全文如下：
    “我们，从世界各地聚集于世界民主青年与学生联欢大会的民主青年代表，谨表示我们不屈不挠的意志和愿望：希望幸福地生活在一个永不知道穷困、恐惧和战争的世界里。我们深信：我们的力量与全世界各民族的力量团结起来，定能创造出这种新生活。因此，我们用一切种族和信仰的千百万青年的名义庄严宣誓：保卫和平，使帝国主义发动新战争的计划成为泡影。我们誓为改善人民的生活条件而斗争。由于我们的许多兄弟和姐妹们，在反法西斯主义的斗争中牺牲了他们的生命，世界才获得了真正的民主与和平。我们号召所有的青年——全世界人民的希望——团结起来，防止新战争。我们誓为争取和平和幸福的神圣目的而斗争，直到胜利为止。”
