Prevention and Control of Wheat Bunt and Nematode Diseases
    Ma Juweng
    Wheat is about to be sown. There are two major wheat diseases that need to be prevented:

    　　　　1. Bunt
    Bunt is commonly known as "meidan" (霉疸) [mold spots], and also called "yaobao" (药包) [medicine packets] or "wumei" (乌霉) [black mold]. It is called bunt because the diseased grains have a fishy odor when crushed. This disease is currently a relatively serious and widespread disease in North China. Because farmers do not understand its transmission and do not pay attention to the selection and purchase of seeds, the affected area has gradually expanded in recent years, causing farmers a great deal of headache. In particularly severely affected areas, yield reductions reach 50% or even complete crop failure.

    This disease is mainly transmitted by the black powder of the diseased grains. If good wheat is contaminated with the black powder, it is certain to develop bunt the following year. Local people everywhere say that wheat develops bunt when it gets moldy, because bunt is easily broken when wet and easily contaminates good grains. If there is no bunt in the good wheat at all, it will not develop bunt even if it gets wet and moldy. Therefore, our control method is mainly to eliminate those black powders (pathogens).

    The methods for preventing and controlling bunt include the traditional method of mixing seeds with asphalt and liquor, which does have some effect, but the most economical and effective methods are chemical seed treatment and warm water soaking.

    (1) Ceresan: There are still considerable quantities stored in various places, and the Ministry of Agriculture has also distributed a lot to various places. The dosage is two qian (钱) of powder per ten jin (斤) of seeds. Place the medicine and seeds in a kerosene barrel, shake vigorously to ensure that the seeds are all coated with the powder.

    (2) Longhong (龙汞) [presumably a mercury compound]: This is a pink powder. The dosage is four qian (钱) of medicine per ten jin (斤) of seeds. However, it should be noted that sowing should be done as soon as possible after seed treatment.

    (3) Mercury Preparation No. 1: There are still considerable quantities stored in various places. There are two types: one for seed treatment and one for soaking. The one for seed treatment is a pink powder, using four qian (钱) of powder per ten jin (斤) of seeds. The one for soaking is a white powder; the powder turns blue when placed in water. Use a ratio of 0.2% for soaking. That is, add one liang (两) of medicine to 500 liang (两) of water, soak the seeds for 15 minutes, and then rinse with clean water, otherwise it will hinder germination. The prepared medicinal solution can be used continuously; after three or four uses, it is necessary to add some more powder.

    (4) Warm Water Soaking: Soak in warm water at 54 degrees Celsius for 5 minutes. In places without thermometers, use warm water made by mixing one part of cold water with one and a half parts of boiling water (same weight as the seeds) and soak for 5 minutes. After taking out the seeds, soak them in cold water for a while, and then sow them. However, when preparing warm water, the procedure must be fast and the water must be boiling.

    　　　　2. Nematode Disease

    Nematode disease is commonly known as "Wangmu Liu" (王母瘤) [Queen Mother's tumor], "Mai Youzi" (麦莠子) [wheat weeds], or "Malianzi" (马莲子) [Iris seeds], and the affected areas are quite widespread. Some farmers do not understand the severity of its transmission and neglect this disease, believing that diseased grains will not sprout. They do not know that the occurrence of wheat weeds is entirely due to diseased grains parasitizing on good wheat grains, causing the good wheat grains to turn into wheat weeds. Therefore, some local people often say that once you have this stuff, it increases year after year, which is the reason for its transmission.

    The control method is mainly to remove these diseased grains. It is best to use a nematode separator. We are preparing to manufacture them, but it is too late to apply them this year. The effective methods now are still mud water and salt water selection.

    (1) Salt Water Selection: Salt water selection is one of the effective methods for controlling nematode disease. The method is to dissolve one or two jin (斤) of salt in ten jin (斤) of water, wait for it to dissolve completely, stir with a wooden stick, put the seeds into the salt water, stir again with a wooden stick, and then remove the diseased grains and unfulfilled wheat grains floating on the surface. Rinse with clean water to remove the salt, dry, and then sow. However, it should be noted that if the seeds are mixed with honey ear disease masses (also known as egg yolk, yellow gum disease), they are not easy to float up and should be sieved before selection. Because honey ear disease masses are relatively small and easily sieved out, if they are not sieved out and dissolve in the water, they will contaminate good grains, leading to honey ear disease the following year.

    (2) Mud Water Selection: Add two jin (斤) of fine dry clay to ten jin (斤) of water (if it is wet soil, add some more), dissolve it fully, stir evenly, then put in the seeds, remove the diseased grains floating on the surface, and then remove the good grains below, dry them, and then sow. Using mud for seed selection saves the washing procedure compared to salt water, but it is also necessary to sieve out honey ear disease first.

　　小麦腥黑穗病和线虫病的防除法
    马矍翁
    现在小麦快下种了。小麦有两大病害需要预防：
    　　　　一、腥黑穗病
    腥黑穗病俗名霉疸，也有叫药包、乌霉的，因为把病粒捻开，有鱼腥臭味，所以叫腥黑穗病。此病在目前华北说，为一较严重较广泛的病害。因为农民对他的传播不了解，调剂和购买种子不注意以致近几年来面积逐渐扩大，农民对他也非常头痛，个别严重地区，减收达到百分之五十，甚或颗粒不收。
    这种病主要是靠病粒的黑粉传染，好麦一沾染上黑粉，没问题明年一定是黑疸。各地老乡们都说麦子霉了生黑疸，原因就是霉疸着湿，容易破裂，容易沾染在好粒上。假如好麦子里根本没黑疸，就是着湿发霉，也不生黑疸。因此我们的除治方法，主要是消灭那些黑粉（病菌）。
    防治腥黑穗病的办法，土法有用柏油和烧酒拌种的，确实有些效果，但比较经济而有效的首推药剂拌种和温汤浸种。
    （一）赛雷散：各地存有不少数量，农业部也发到各地不少。用药量是种子十斤，药粉二钱，将药与种子放置煤油桶内，用力摇拌，务使种子都能沾染药粉。
    （二）龙汞：为粉红色粉末，用量，种子十斤用药四钱，唯应注意拌种后，要尽速播种。
    （三）水银制剂一号：各地存放尚有不少数量，分拌种用和浸种用二种。拌种用的是粉红色粉末，每十斤种子拌药粉四钱。浸种用的是白色粉末，粉末放入水中即是蓝色，用千分之二比例浸种。即用药一两加水五百两，将种子放入浸十五分钟，取出用净水洗净，否则会妨碍发芽。配好的药水，可连续使用，经三四次后，须酌加药粉。
    （四）温汤浸种：用摄氏表五十四度温水浸五分钟。没有温度表的地方可用同种子等量的一份凉水一份半开水对成的温水浸五分钟，捞出后用冷水泡一下，即可播种，不过配温水时，手续要快，水要滚开才行。
    　　　　二、线虫病
    线虫病俗名王母瘤、麦莠子或马莲子，为害地区相当普遍。有的农民不了解他的传播严重，认为病粒不出苗，而忽视这项病害。却不知道麦莠子的发生，完全是病粒寄生在好麦粒上，使好麦粒变成麦莠子。所以有的老乡常说一有这种东西，一年就比一年多，就是它传染的原因。
    除治办法，主要是去掉这些病粒。最好用线虫汰除器。现在我们正准备制造，但今年已来不及应用，现在有效的办法，还是泥水和盐水选种法。
    （一）盐水选种法：盐水选种为除治线虫病有效办法之一，方法是用盐一斤或二斤溶解于十斤水中，俟其充分溶解，用木棍搅一下，将种子放入盐水中，再用木棍搅一下，将浮在上面的病粒和不饱实的麦粒捞出来，用清水洗净盐质，晾干，即可播种。但须注意的，如种子内混有蜜穗病块（又名鸡蛋黄、黄胶病）的，不容易浮起来，应在选种前筛一下才好。因为蜜穗病块比较小，容易筛出去，假若不筛出去，溶解在水里边，沾染好粒，会招致来年蜜穗病害的。
    （二）泥水选种：水十斤，把细干粘土二斤放入水中（如系湿土需酌加一些），使充分溶解后，搅拌均匀，即将种子放入，把浮在上面的病粒捞出后，再把下边的好粒捞出晾干，即可播种。用泥土选种比盐水省去洗的手续，但有蜜穗病的也必需先筛一下。
