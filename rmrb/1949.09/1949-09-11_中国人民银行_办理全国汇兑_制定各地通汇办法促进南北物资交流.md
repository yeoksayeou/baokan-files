　　People's Bank of China
　  Handles National Remittances
　  Formulates Inter-Regional Remittance Methods to Promote North-South Material Exchange
    [Our Newspaper] Recently, the People's Bank of China decided to universally carry out domestic remittances. In addition to the universal inter-regional remittance in various regions within the customs, and increasing the remittance limit, an agreement has also been reached with the Northeast Bank regarding inter-regional remittances between the inside and outside of the customs, implementing focused inter-regional remittances.
    This will make the material exchange between the North and the South smoother. Northern coal, cotton, oil, alkali and Southern yarn, cloth, tea and daily necessities can be exchanged in large quantities, and Northeast grain, steel, and timber can be continuously supplied to the inside of the customs. The main contents of its remittance methods are as follows:
    1. Adhering to the policy of smooth remittance, low price, and large remittance volume, the People's Banks in various regions should expedite inter-regional remittances with necessary locations. Generally, no restrictions should be added. However, when prices fluctuate or when necessary in new areas, temporary management can be implemented to prevent speculation.
    2. In order to expand the remittance limit, a centralized clearing system is implemented. Within a province, the provincial People's Bank branch will centrally clear and uniformly dispatch funds. Inter-provincial remittances between provincial branches and between Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Nanjing, Hankou, Jinan, and Xi'an are centrally cleared and uniformly dispatched by the head office of the People's Bank. Remittance accounting adopts a two-tier and three-tier banking system. Remittances to the Northeast region are temporarily transferred through the Shanhaiguan Associated Office.
    3. The main remittance points between regions are divided into two grades: A and B. Grade A remittance points are Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Nanjing, Hankou, Xi'an, Zhengzhou, Wuxi, and Taiyuan. Grade B remittance points are Tangshan, Shijiazhuang, Baoding, Zhangjiakou, Xinxiang, Hangzhou, Wuhu, Bengbu, Weifang, Qingdao, Xuzhou, Yantai, Fuzhou, Kaifeng, Changsha, Shashi, Yichang, Nanchang, Xuchang, Lanzhou, Xining, and Baoji. The above-mentioned Grade A remittance points will begin to expand the remittance limit and strive to achieve unlimited remittance as soon as possible. The daily remittance limit for Grade B remittance points is increased to 20 million yuan, and the remittance difference limit is increased to 300 million.
    Inter-regional remittance between inside and outside the customs: Remittance points outside the customs are Shenyang, Jinzhou, Harbin, and Andong. Inside the customs are Beijing, Tianjin, Baoding, Tangshan, Shanghai, Jinan, Yantai, Qingdao, Hangzhou, Hankou, Zhengzhou, and Xi'an. In the future, according to trade needs, the number of remittance points will gradually increase.
    4. Remittance types include telegraphic transfer, draft remittance, and mail remittance, all of which will be handled. Escrow business will be gradually handled based on conditions (such as transportation insurance). The Bank of China in various port cities should handle inland escrow with the People's Bank of China in the production areas of export goods according to export needs to facilitate exports.

　　中国人民银行
　  办理全国汇兑
　  制定各地通汇办法促进南北物资交流
    【本报讯】最近中国人民银行决定普遍开展内汇，除关内各区普遍通汇，增大汇额外，对关内外的汇兑，亦已和东北银行商有协议，实行有重点的通汇。
    这样将使南北的物资交流更加顺畅，北方的煤、棉、油、碱和南方的纱、布、茶及日用品可以大量交换，而且东北的粮食、钢铁、木材，可以源源地供给关内了。兹探悉其通汇办法主要内容如下：
    一、本畅通汇兑廉价多汇方针，各地人民银行均尽速与必要的地点通汇，一般不加限制，但当物价波动或新区有必要时，可暂时管理，以防止助长投机。
    二、为了扩大汇兑限额，实行集中清算制度。在一省范围内，由省人民银行分行集中清算统一调度。各省分行间及平、津、沪、宁、汉、济、西安间汇兑均由人民银行总行集中清算统一调度。汇兑帐务处理采用二级行制与三级行制。对东北区的汇兑暂均通过山海关联办转汇。
    三、将各区间的主要通汇点分为甲乙二等：甲等通汇点为北平、天津、上海、南京、汉口、西安、郑州、无锡、太原九地。乙等通汇点为唐山、石家庄、保定、张家口、新乡、杭州、芜湖、蚌埠、潍坊、青岛、徐州、烟台、福州、开封、长沙、沙市、宜昌、南昌、许昌、兰州、西宁、宝鸡等二十二地，上述甲等通汇点即开始扩大汇兑限额并争取早日实现无限额汇兑。乙等通汇点每日汇兑限额增至二千万元，汇兑差额限度增至三亿。
    关内外通汇：关外通汇点为沈阳、锦州、哈尔滨、安东四地。关内为北平、天津、保定、唐山、上海、济南、烟台、青岛、杭州、汉口、郑州、西安等十二地。将来根据贸易的需要，通汇点将逐渐增加。
    四、汇兑种类，电汇、票汇、信汇，均行举办，并根据条件（如交通保险等）逐渐办理押汇业务。各口岸城市的中国银行均根据出口需要与出口物资产地的中国人民银行办理内地押汇以便利出口。
