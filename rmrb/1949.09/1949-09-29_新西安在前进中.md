　　New Xi'an is Moving Forward
　　By our correspondents in Xi'an, Yao Liwen and Zhang Keren

Like other liberated cities, the ancient capital of Xi'an is rapidly moving forward. Six hundred thousand citizens have escaped the darkness and begun a new life.

During the thirteen years of the Hu Zongnan bandit army's rule, the citizens lived in constant fear of secret agent persecution and starvation. According to known figures, over 30,000 innocent citizens were brutally murdered by the Hu bandits. Countless citizens and business owners were bankrupted or forced to close their businesses due to their exorbitant taxes, levies, and fraudulent schemes, resulting in tens of thousands of unemployed people roaming the streets. Especially when the Hu bandits withdrew from Xi'an, they carried out a final large-scale destruction against the people of the city, frantically blowing up all the generators of the electric power plant on which the people depended for their livelihood, and the largest private Dahua Machinery Textile Factory with more than 30,000 spindles. They also looted the products and funds of various industrial and commercial households.

However, all this cannot hinder the progress of the new Xi'an. The Communist Party and the People's Government are good at uniting the people to overcome difficulties. From the first day of entering the city, the People's Government paid attention to eliminating secret agents, ensuring the safety of the people, and uniting people from all walks of life to start restoring production on the basis of ruins. In the past three months, the restoration of industry and commerce in the city has achieved significant results.

Xi'an's industrial base is relatively weak. In addition to state-owned enterprises such as railways and telecommunications, there are only small-scale machinery, textile, and soap factories. In terms of state-owned enterprises, thanks to the active repair work of railway employees, the western section of the Longhai Railway was opened to traffic as early as possible, playing a leading role in supporting the front and resuming production. The repair of the Qishui Bridge is a fragment of the heroic deeds of the railway. On May 21, when the Hu bandits fled, they completely destroyed the Qishui Bridge (located between Pujii and Wugong, west of Xi'an). With the liberation of Puwu, Xi'an engineers and workers who had just been liberated rushed to the site to measure and prepare for repairs. Because our army was luring the enemy in deep, the work could not be started in time, so the enthusiastic workers took the opportunity to repair the bridge frames in Xi'an as soon as possible. The repair started, and some workers went to work at 1:00 a.m. and got off work at 9:00 a.m. the next day. When the time came, they insisted on driving in four more piles. Twenty-four bridge-building workers persevered for two days and one night. The selfless labor of all the staff enabled the Qishui Bridge, which was originally planned to be completed in seventeen days, to be officially opened to traffic five days ahead of schedule. Recently, the Chang'an Street locomotive depot launched a production competition, and all departments have caught up with or exceeded the production level before liberation. For example, the sand casting class used to start the furnace twice a month before liberation, melting one ton of iron each time. Now, it starts the furnace three times a month, melting two tons of iron each time. The copper casting class used to start three furnaces a month before liberation. In July, it was able to start four furnaces. In August, the first furnace only took five days, and the output was greatly increased, while the materials were saved by 50%. The People's Power Plant, which was severely damaged by bandits, actively repaired the No. 2 generator on the third day after liberation, allowing the city to regain light. In the early days of liberation, the monthly electricity sales were 270,000 kilowatt-hours, which increased to 470,000 kilowatt-hours in August, restoring 84% of the production level before liberation. The increase in the repair profit of the People's Machinery Factory shows the daily improvement of the production level. The profit in July was 789,000 yuan, and it reached 4,085,000 yuan in August.

Xi'an has five private enterprises with a slightly modern scale: textile, flour, and match industries. Among the machine textile industries, the Dahua Textile Factory, which was destroyed by the enemy, had 30,000 spindles and 800 looms before liberation. When fully operational, it produced 60 pieces of yarn and 1,200 pieces of cloth per day. The factory resumed work in June and began to recover 8.2% of its pre-liberation output. In July, it increased to 51%, and by the end of August, the production level had reached more than 90% of the pre-liberation level. The other four textile factories have a total of 4,910 spindles. Before liberation, the average production was 122 pieces of yarn per month. In June, it recovered 57.8% of the original average output. In July, it increased to 84.8%, and in August, the monthly output of yarn was 134 pieces, exceeding the pre-liberation level.

In the past three months, the production of hand-woven textiles has not only exceeded the pre-liberation output, but has also exceeded the production level during the heyday of the Hu bandits' rule. At the peak of hand-woven textiles, there were 525 households, with 2,074 machines in operation, and a monthly output of 45,100 pieces of cloth. By the time of liberation, the number of machines in operation had been sharply reduced to 780. In August after liberation, 1,369 looms were in operation. However, thanks to the support of the trade company, timely supply of raw materials, smooth sales channels, and rapid capital turnover, the productivity of each loom was greatly improved, and the total output in one month reached more than 50,300 pieces. Among the 17 large flour industries, except for the Huafeng No. 1 factory, which was severely damaged by the enemy and is repairing machinery and actively preparing for resumption of work, the other 16 factories have increased from 8,830 bags per day to more than 11,300 bags compared with before liberation, an increase of 28%. The number of small flour industries has increased from 11 at the time of liberation to 38. At an industrial symposium, the city's flour industry production and sales association reflected two different encounters of small-scale handicrafts: before liberation, not only were there heavy taxes and levies, but it was also unprofitable, or even free of charge, to make military flour for the bandit army. Due to the inability to withstand the squeeze, the number of small flour factories decreased from 17 to 11. After liberation, the People's Government supported handicrafts, the loan procedures were convenient, and the difficulties in supply and sales were resolved, so small flour factories developed rapidly.

The relationship between urban and rural areas after liberation is rapidly recovering. Agricultural products are pouring into cities, promoting the export of industrial products and daily necessities to rural areas. The figures that can be counted from the business directly operated by the city's trade company can also show the progress of urban and rural recovery. In July, more than 849,000 catties of wheat and more than 141,000 catties of oil were purchased, and less than 10,000 pieces of various foreign cloths were exported. In August, the amount of wheat increased more than tenfold, totaling 9.55 million catties, and the export of foreign cloth increased to more than 20,000 pieces. With the victorious advance of the People's Liberation Army, the recovery of commercial ties between Gansu and Shaanxi, and the imminent full opening of the Longhai Railway, the accelerated recovery of urban and rural exchanges has encouraged the business interests of merchants in Xi'an. All of the city's more than 11,000 large and small factories and shops have opened for business, except for more than 100 that had closed down and moved out before liberation. The new plan that is increasing day by day among businessmen is to raise funds and go to large cities such as Shanghai and Tianjin to purchase goods. This has made the bank's remittance business active. The foreign exchange of the Xi'an branch of the People's Bank was 190 million yuan in July, and it soared to 5.1 billion yuan in August. The new Xi'an is moving towards the direction of a productive city.

Although there are still many urgent problems to be solved on the road to progress, such as the huge and bloated enterprise structure caused by the old bureaucratic capital setting up institutions based on personal relationships, the large and unreasonable disparity in wages among various systems, the labor-management disputes that have occurred in some private factories, and the urgent need for employment for tens of thousands of unemployed refugees, all of these have aroused the attention of the People's Government, which is convening a people's representative conference to mobilize the people of the city to strive for gradual solutions.

A new proverb is circulating among the Muslims in Xi'an: "The Muslims have turned over, Saiwa cloth (thank you) the People's Liberation Army" (people in the new district call the Communist Party, the People's Government, and the People's Liberation Army the People's Liberation Army). The formation of this proverb has undergone twists and turns. In the early days of liberation, the Muslims, who had been influenced by the reactionary propaganda of Hu Ma bandits for more than ten years, treated the People's Liberation Army and the People's Government with suspicion; but this artificial barrier created by reactionary elements was quickly broken by the facts. The People's Government respected and took care of the customs of the Muslims everywhere. During the military control period, the curfew was imposed from 12:00 p.m., but the Muslims were still allowed to follow their own living habits to perform the "seal festival," such as beating the clapper and fetching water at night, and shouting fasting, etc. The Muslim Ma Mingfu said with emotion: "During the military control period, the government was so considerate of the Muslims' fasting habits and provided convenience. The Muslims are really grateful to the government." On July 28, 60,000 Muslims in the city celebrated the first "Eid al-Adha" after liberation. Muslims wore brand-new clothes and white hats, and happily walked into the mosque. The number of people worshiping in each mosque was more than double that of previous years. Sixty percent of the Muslims are small vendors. Due to the abolition of exorbitant taxes and the abolition of the extortion of pseudo-police bandit agents, many people have initially improved their lives. Ma Haowen, of Xiyangsi Street, is one of them. Ma Haowen makes a living by selling cakes. Before liberation, the pseudo-police often ate a few plates, wiped their mouths and left. One came, and then another came, causing him to lose money in business. After liberation, no one dared to play rogue anymore. Ma Haowen worked harder and harder in production, saved money, and bought a mule and a cart for transportation, which changed the situation of being half-starved for more than ten years. The People's Government is very concerned about the welfare of the Muslims and is brewing to set up a trade branch to specialize in supporting and organizing Muslim production.

During the rule of Hu Ma bandits, the pseudo-provincial No. 3 Middle School was nominally a Muslim school, but in reality, less than one-tenth of the students were Muslims. For this reason, the People's Government specially allowed poor Muslim children to apply for free admission. In the sixth district, where there are a large number of Muslims, government workers actively mobilized Muslim children to enroll in school. The original No. 2 Primary School in the district had 70 Muslim students, and now it has doubled, accounting for seven-tenths of the school's students. The correct ethnic policy and the sincere actions to seek the welfare of the Muslims have made the People's Government and the Muslims closely united.

　　新西安在前进中
    本报驻西安记者  姚力文、张克仁
    和解放了的其他城市一样，古都西安正在迅速前进中，六十万市民已摆脱了黑暗，开始新生。
    在胡宗南匪军统治的十三个年头中，市民终日生活在特务迫害与饥饿死亡中。据已知数字，惨遭胡匪杀害的无辜市民达三万余人之多。无数市民与工商业户因不堪其苛杂勒索与敲诈撞骗而倾家荡产或关门歇业，造成了数以万计的失业人口，流浪街头。尤当胡匪撤出西安之际，又施展了对全市人民的最后大破坏，疯狂的炸毁了人民赖以生活的电灯厂的全部发电机，和最大的拥有三万多纱锭的私营大华机器纺织厂，并大肆抢劫各工商户的产品与资金。
    但是，这一切，阻碍不了新西安的前进。共产党和人民政府是善于团结人民战胜困难的。从入城的第一天起，人民政府即注意了肃清特务，保障人民安全，团结各界人民在一片残破的基础上着手恢复生产。三个月来，全市工商业的恢复已获得显著成绩。
    西安的工业基础是较薄弱的，除铁路、邮电等公营企业外，仅有小规模的机器业、纺织业及肥皂厂。在公营企业方面，由于铁路员工积极抢修，使陇海路西段及早通车，在支前与复工生产中起着带头作用。抢修漆水桥是铁路英雄事迹中的一个片断。五月二十一日，胡匪逃跑时，完全炸毁了漆水桥（位西安以西普集与武功间），随着普武的解放，刚获解放的西安工程师、工人们便赶赴该地测量准备抢修。因我军正诱敌深入，未得及时动工，热忱的工人便在西安趁早把桥架修好。抢修开始了，有的工人半夜一点上班，次日九点下班。时间到了，又坚持打了四根桩。二十四个架桥的工友，连续坚持了两天一夜的工作。全体职工的忘我劳动，使原计划十七天完工的漆水桥提前五天便正式通车了。最近长安街机务段展开了生产竞赛，各部门均赶上或超过解放前生产水准。比如翻砂班，解放前每月开炉两次，每次化铁一吨，现下每月开炉三次，每次化铁两吨。铸铜班解放前每月开三炉，七月份能开四炉，八月份第一炉只用了五天产量大为增加，而材料却节省了百分之五十。被匪徒们破坏惨重的人民电厂，解放后的第三天，职工们积极修复了二号发电机，使全市重放光明。解放初期，每月售电二十七万度，八月份已增至四十七万度，恢复解放前生产水平的百分之八十四。人民机械厂的修理盈利额的增涨，表现了生产水平的逐日提高。七月份盈利额为七十八万九千元，八月份即达四百零八万五千元。
    西安市稍具现代规模的私营企业有纺织、面粉及火柴业五家。机器纺织业中遭敌破坏的大华纺织厂，解放前有纺锭三万枚，织布机八百台，全部开动，每日纺纱六十件，织布一千二百匹，该厂于六月复工，开始恢复解放前产量百分之八点二，七月份增至百分之五十一，八月下旬的生产水平已达解放前百分之九十以上。其他四家纺织厂计有纱锭四千九百一十枚，解放前平均生产量为月产纱一百二十二件，六月份恢复原平均产量的百分之五十七点八，七月份增至百分之八十四点八，八月份月产纱一百三十四件。已超过解放前水平了。
    三个月来的手工纺织生产，不仅超过解放前产量，且已超过胡匪统治时极盛时代的生产水平。手工纺织最盛时，有五百二十五家，开动机数为二千零七十四张，月产布四万五千一百匹，迄解放前开动机数已锐减至七百八十张，解放后八月份的生产情况是开动布机一千三百六十九张，但由于贸易公司的扶植，原料供应及时，销路畅通，资金周转快，因而每张布机生产力大为提高，一个月的总产量竟达五万三百余匹。十七家大型面粉业，除华峰一厂遭敌破坏严重正修整机器积极筹备复工外，其他十六个厂与解放前相较已由日产八千八百三十袋增至一万一千三百余袋，增产百分之二十八。小型面粉业则由解放时的十一家增至三十八家。在一次工业座谈会上，市面粉业产销公会反映了小型手工业的两种不同的遭遇：解放前不仅捐税重重，给匪军赶做军面无利可图，甚至是无代价的，由于经不起压榨，小型面粉厂由十七家减至十一家；解放后人民政府扶植手工业，贷款手续方便，供销困难得到解决，小型面粉厂便快速发展起来了。
    解放后的城乡关系，在迅速的恢复中。农产品源源流入城市，促进工业品日用品的输向农村。仅就市贸易公司直接经营的业务能够统计的数字，也可看出城乡恢复的进度。七月份购进麦为八十四万九千余斤，油十四万一千余斤，输出各种洋布不足一万匹。八月份麦子增达十倍以上，计九百五十五万斤，输出洋布增至两万多匹。随着解放军的胜利推进，甘陕商业联系的恢复，陇海线的即将全线通车，城乡交流的加速恢复，鼓励了西安市商人们的经营兴趣。全市一万一千余大小工厂商店，除解放前早已停业外迁的百多户外，全部开张营业了。商民中逐日增多的新打算，是筹集资金，赶赴上海、天津等大城市办货。这使得银行的通汇业务活跃起来。人民银行西安分行七月份外汇为一亿九千万元，八月激增至五十一亿元了。新西安向着生产城市的方向迈进。
    虽然，在前进的路上还有许多急待解决的问题，诸如旧的官僚资本因人设事而造成企业机构的庞大臃肿，各系统工资的悬殊太大与不合理，某些私营工厂已发生的劳资纠纷以及数万失业难民的急需就业，这一切，已引起人民政府的重视，正召开各界人民代表会议，动员全市人民力谋逐次解决。
    西安市的回民中传颂着一个新的谚语：“回民翻了身，赛娃布（感谢）解放军”（新区人民对于共产党、人民政府和解放军均称之为解放军）。这一谚语的形成是经过曲折变化的。解放的初期，受胡马匪十数年反动宣传影响的回民们，曾以疑惧的眼光对待解放军和人民政府；但这道反动分子人为的壁障，很快就被事实冲破了。人民政府处处尊重与照顾了回民的习惯，军管时期，晚间十二时起戒严，仍允许回民按照自己的生活习惯去例行“封节日”。如夜间打梆子打水，喊斋等。回民马明甫情动于衷的说：“军管时期政府这样体贴回民的斋期习惯，给予方便，回民对政府实在感激得很。”七月二十八日，全市六万回民欢度解放的第一个“尔德节”。回民们一个个穿着崭新的衣服，头戴洁白的帽子，欢欣鼓舞的步入清真寺。各清真寺礼拜的人数比往年增加一倍多。回民中有百分之六十是小商贩，由于苛杂税的废除和取缔了伪警察匪特人员的敲诈，不少人初步改善了生活。西洋寺街马浩文就是其中的一个。马浩文靠卖糕维持生活，解放前，伪警察常常是吃上几碟子，嘴一抹拍屁股就走。这个去，那个又来了，弄得他生意亏本。解放后，再也没人敢耍无赖了。马浩文生产干的格外有劲，省吃俭用，添买了个骡子，拉了辆大车搞运输，改变了十几年来半饥半饱的境地。人民政府非常关怀回民的福利，正酝酿筹设贸易分公司，专事扶助与组织回民生产。
    胡马匪统治时，伪省立三中名义上为回民学校，实际上回民学生不足十分之一。为此人民政府特允准回民贫苦子弟得申请免费入学。在回民为数较多的六区，政府工作人员积极发动回民子弟入学，该区第二完小原有回民学生七十人，现已增添一倍，占全校学生的十分之七了。正确的民族政策，真诚的为回民谋福利的行动，使得人民政府与回民紧紧地团结在一起了。
