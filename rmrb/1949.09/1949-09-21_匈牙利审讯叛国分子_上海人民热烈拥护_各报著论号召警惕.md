Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, September 19th: The Hungarian people's trial of spies and traitors such as Rajk has received great attention and enthusiastic support from the people and media in Shanghai. Shanghai's *Liberation Daily*, *Xinwen Daily*, *Ta Kung Pao*, and *Wenhui Daily* all published this news in prominent positions. *Ta Kung Pao* also published a commentary saying: The fact that American imperialism and the Tito clique colluded with Hungarian spies and traitors to attempt to overthrow the Hungarian People's Democratic government should arouse great vigilance among the Chinese people, and should also arouse the vigilance of Chinese democratic individualists, to be careful not to be bought by American spies and mistakenly embark on the path of treason. *Wenhui Daily* commented: The Hungarian People's Government's cracking of the Rajk treason case is a major victory for the peace and democracy camp in the struggle against aggression and fascism. This case teaches us that only by strengthening the people's democratic dictatorship and giving the imperialist aggressors and their pawns a relentless suppression can we consolidate the people's revolutionary victory.

　　匈牙利审讯叛国分子
    上海人民热烈拥护
  　各报著论号召警惕
    【新华社上海十九日电】匈牙利人民对间谍叛国分子拉伊克等的审判受到上海人民和上海舆论界的极大重视和热烈拥护。上海解放日报、新闻日报、大公报、文汇报均以显著地位刊登此项消息。大公报并发表评论说：美帝国主义和铁托集团勾结匈牙利间谍叛国分子企图推翻匈牙利人民民主政权的事实，应该引起中国人民的极大警惕，同时也应该引起中国的民主个人主义者警惕，小心不要被美国间谍收买，误进叛国的歧途。文汇报评论说：匈牙利人民政府破获拉伊克叛国案，正是和平民主阵营在反侵略反法西斯斗争中的一个重大胜利。该案教训我们：唯有加强人民民主专政，给帝国主义侵略家及其爪牙以无情的镇压，才能巩固人民的革命胜利。
