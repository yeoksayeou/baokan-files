Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 10th: Li Huichuan, the Chinese railway delegate who recently returned to Beijing after attending the Second Congress of the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), gave a report to more than 2,000 railway workers in Beijing on the 7th of this month. He first explained that although the Chinese delegation to the WFTU was unable to directly participate in the congress due to the obstruction of the Italian reactionaries, the work that should have been done had been entrusted to other fraternal national delegations to handle on their behalf. The list of candidates for the WFTU General Council proposed by the Chinese delegation had also been submitted by other fraternal national delegations, thus making the delegates from various countries at the congress feel as if the Chinese delegates were also present at the meeting. When the congress heard the report on the Chinese workers' movement, the audience cheered and stood up. The General Secretary of the WFTU, Saillant, said: Although the reactionary leaders of the reactionary trade unions in the Netherlands, in violation of the will of the workers, withdrew from the WFTU, 500,000 Dutch workers are in essence still standing with their working-class brothers around the world. The liberation of Shanghai, China, immediately added a large number of new members to the WFTU. It is evident that China's liberation cause has a great impact on the world's workers. Next, Li Huichuan introduced his impressions of visiting the construction of the new democratic countries in Eastern Europe. He said: The efficiency of railway transportation in Hungary was originally very low, but their vehicle turnaround rate has been increased from the original fourteen days to the current three days. The only secret to their enormous and rapid progress is learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. Li Huichuan called on everyone to work hard to learn from the Soviet Union's experience in railway construction and improve the efficiency of the Chinese People's Railways. He also called on everyone to take practical actions to prepare to welcome the delegates from fraternal countries who will be coming to China to attend the Asian and Australasian Trade Union Representatives Conference.

　　出席世界工联代表李汇川
　  向铁路职工作报告
　  号召学习苏联经验提高人民铁路效能
    【新华社北平十日电】最近出席世界工联第二次代表大会返平的中国铁路代表李汇川于本月七日在北平市向二千余铁路职工作报告。他首先说明这次我国出席世界工联的代表团虽因意大利反动派的阻挠，未能直接参加大会，但应该做的工作都已委托其他兄弟国家代表团代办，我国代表团所提出的世界工联理事会的选举名单亦已由其他兄弟国家代表团代为提出，因而使大会各国的代表们感到犹如中国代表也在会场一样。当大会听到中国工人运动的报告时，会场欢呼起立。世界工联总书记赛扬说：虽然荷兰反动工会的反动领袖，违反工人的意志，退出世界工联，但是五十万的荷兰工人在实质上仍然与世界工人阶级兄弟们站在一起。中国上海市的解放，立刻给世界工联增加了大量会员的新生力量。可见中国解放事业对世界工人影响是很大的。接着李汇川介绍了中国代表团参观东欧新民主主义国家建设的观感。他说：匈牙利铁路运输的效率原来是很低的，但是他们的车辆周转率已由原来的十四天提高到了现在的三天多。他们获得这样巨大而迅速进步的唯一秘密，就是学习了苏联的先进经验。李汇川号召大家要努力地学习苏联建设铁路的经验，把中国人民铁路的效能提高。他并号召大家要以实际行动，准备欢迎即将来到中国出席亚洲澳洲职工代表会议的兄弟国家的代表。
