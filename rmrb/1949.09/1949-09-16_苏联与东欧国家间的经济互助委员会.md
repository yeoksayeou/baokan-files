　　The formation of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (COMECON) between Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Romania, the Soviet Union, and Czechoslovakia has stirred profound repercussions around the world. It not only provides evidence of the great progress in the development of economic cooperation between people's democratic countries and between them and the Soviet Union, but also elevates cooperation to a higher level.

　　This council is a complete manifestation of the new relationship between these countries, a relationship based on genuine democratic principles and equality, and built on sincere international cooperation.

　　In the capitalist world, international economic cooperation merely subordinates the interests of weaker countries to those of stronger countries, as evidenced by the Organization for European Economic Cooperation established by the Marshall Plan. This organization is entirely the creation of American monopoly capital. If the members of this organization have any equality at all, it is in their equal obedience to the calls and commands of American imperialism. What brings together the sixteen Marshall Plan participating countries is only the will of American monopoly capital and the desire of irresponsible politicians to obtain as large a portion as possible from American loans. From this perspective, it is not surprising that the Organization for European Economic Cooperation has become a battlefield for mutually contradictory groups and forces. The failure of attempts to coordinate the apparently incompatible "revival plans" put forward by the Marshallized countries proves that the efforts of imperialists to organize the Western European economy are based on unsound foundations. For imperialist elements, the Organization for European Economic Cooperation is merely a component of the military-political bloc they have hastily established. Nothing is more detrimental to the post-war recovery of European countries than this organization.

　　The post-war economic cooperation established between the Soviet Union and the countries of Central and Southeastern Europe is based on completely different principles. It has written an entirely new chapter in the history of international economic relations. This relationship is for the first time being built on the basis of complete equality between all parties and mutual respect for each other's interests. The selfless assistance and support of the Soviet Union has made it possible for Poland, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania to rapidly overcome the severe consequences of the war and re-establish their economies. Only the unwavering policy of the Soviet Union can explain this astonishing fact: Eastern European countries, which suffered immeasurably greater losses in the war than Western European countries, have successfully solved the problem of economic recovery, and in 1948, many of them had already exceeded their pre-war production levels. People's democratic countries, thanks to their effective economic cooperation among themselves and with the Soviet Union, have been able to stabilize their economies, rapidly promote their recovery and development, and create conditions for implementing economic plans and completing long-term economic plans.

　　One of the main results of this economic cooperation is the huge increase in trade between the people's democratic countries and between them and the Soviet Union.

　　Agreements such as the five-year economic cooperation agreement between Poland and Czechoslovakia, and Poland and Romania, have created a solid foundation for mutual assistance and expanded trade between people's democratic countries.

　　On the other hand, the proportion of the Soviet Union in the foreign trade of Central and Eastern European countries has greatly increased, which is fully in line with the economic interests of these countries. In 1949, the Soviet Union will rank first in Czechoslovakia's foreign trade, and in turn, Czechoslovakia is one of the largest in the Soviet Union's foreign trade. Soviet-Polish trade has far exceeded the targets set in the five-year agreement concluded in 1948. The Polish People's Daily reported that in 1948, the two countries exchanged goods worth 225 million US dollars, while the planned figure was 170 million US dollars. The Soviet Union is one of Poland's largest customers, while before the war, Polish trade with the Soviet Union accounted for less than 0.5 percent of its total foreign trade.

　　Equally noteworthy is the development of trade between the Soviet Union and Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary. According to the recently signed agreement, business between the Soviet Union and Romania in 1949 will increase by one and a half times compared to 1948, reaching approximately 465 million rubles each. Trade between the Soviet Union and Bulgaria will increase by 20 percent this year, and the industrial equipment that the Soviet Union will supply to Bulgaria under the loan agreement is not included.

　　These facts prove that economic cooperation between the people's democratic countries and the Soviet Union based on respect for each other's interests has opened up vast possibilities for concentrating the abundant resources of the countries concerned.

　　The establishment of the Economic Commission is another step forward in this regard. The purpose of the commission is to further expand economic cooperation among its member states. The commission will, in accordance with the principle of equal representation, plan to concentrate economic experience, provide technical assistance, and provide mutual assistance in raw materials, food, machinery, and equipment. The economic efforts of the six countries will now be more closely coordinated. Now they have new opportunities to more fully and appropriately utilize the resources of these countries for the benefit of the people. For the people's democratic countries that have begun to develop along the socialist path and are perfecting their planned economies, it will be of great value to be able to rely on the Soviet Union's powerful socialist industry and collective agriculture in their economic activities. This, as pointed out by the newspapers of the people's democratic countries, ensures that the member states of the commission are immune to the impact of the cruel economic crises that are shaking the capitalist world.

　　At the same time, the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance is also a powerful weapon to prevent imperialists from interfering in the internal affairs of these sovereign countries and hindering their economic development.

　　American monopoly capital, accustomed to the obedience and flattery of Western European politicians, cannot tolerate the existence of countries and governments that refuse to submit to the Marshall Plan. The initiators of the Marshall Plan and their servants have for some time been implementing a de facto trade boycott against the people's democratic countries and the Soviet Union. American imperialism apparently believed that their blockade would create insurmountable difficulties for the people's democratic countries and the Soviet Union.

　　But now it can be said with certainty that this policy has failed. In the pre-war European situation, attempts to economically strangle the small and medium-sized countries of Central and Eastern Europe might have succeeded. But in the current situation, such attempts are completely unattainable.

　　Economic cooperation between the people's democratic countries and the strong support of the Soviet state have already contained the efforts of the imperialists. The formation of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance has definitively shattered the hopes of the imperialists, who had dreamed of successfully wielding the weapon of economic pressure against democratic and progressive forces.

　　The statement announcing the establishment of the commission emphasized that it is an open organization, and that other European countries that agree with its principles and desire to conduct broad economic cooperation with the founding countries can participate. This fact has attracted the attention of world public opinion, because it presents new prospects and new hopes for those who advocate lasting peace and sincere international cooperation.

　　The establishment of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance is an event of the greatest international economic and political importance. It demonstrates the steady growth and consolidation of the forces of democracy and socialism. These forces are striving to ensure the peaceful development and welfare of countries, their economic progress and political independence. The Soviet people hail the composition and the fundamental principles of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, considering it as a reflection of the growing new truly democratic relations between the people’s democratic countries and the Soviet Union.

### 苏联与东欧国家间的经济互助委员会

　　苏联与东欧国家间的经济互助委员会
    保、匈、波、罗、苏联及捷克之间经济互助委员会的组成，在全世界激起了深刻的反响。它不仅为人民民主国家间以及他们与苏联之间经济合作发展中的巨大前进提供了明证；而且也使合作升到更高的水平。
    这一委员会是这些国家之间新关系之圆满的表现，这种关系建立在真正的民主原则及平等基础上，建立在真正诚意的国际合作上。
    在资本主义世界里，国际经济合作只是弱小国家的利益附属于强大国家的利益，由马歇尔计划而建立的欧洲经济合作机构就是这一点的证明。这一机构完全是美国垄断资本的创作。如果这一机构的成员有任何一点平等的话，那末就是它们在听从美帝国主义的呼唤和吩咐上是平等的。把十六个马歇尔计划参加国拉到一起的只是美国独占资本的意志和不负责任的政客们自美国贷款中获取尽可能大的部分的愿望。由此看来，欧洲经济合作机构之已成为互相矛盾的集团和势力的角斗场，是并不奇怪的。协调各马歇尔化国家所提出的显然互不相容之“复兴计划”的企图的失败，证明帝国主义者组织西欧经济的努力，其基础是不健全的。对于帝国主义分子说，欧洲经济合作机构只是他们匆忙建立的军事政治集团的一个组成部分。没有什么比该机构更有害于欧洲国家的战后复兴。
    苏联与中欧及东南欧国家间所建立的战后经济合作，其原则与此完全不同。它们写下了国际经济关系史上完全新的一章。这种关系第一次被建立在各方完全平等和互相尊重彼此利益的基础上。苏联的大公无私的援助和支持，使波、捷、保、匈、罗迅速克服其剧烈的战争残余影响和重新树立其经济成为可能。只有苏联的坚定不渝的政策才能说明这一惊人的事实：在战争中较西欧国家遭受不可计量的更大损失的东欧国家已成功地解决了经济恢复问题，而且在一九四八年，其中许多国家就已超过了战前生产水平。人民民主国家，由于它们自己之间以及与苏联之间的有效的经济合作，已经能够稳定它们的经济，迅速推进它们的复兴和发展，创造施行经济计划及完成长期经济计划的条件。
    这种经济合作的主要结果之一是人民民主国家之间以及它们与苏联之间贸易的巨大增加。
    如象波—捷、波—罗之间的五年经济合作协定，为人民民主国家之间的互助和扩大贸易创造了坚实基础。
    另一方面，苏联在中、东欧国家对外贸易中所占份量已大为增加，这完全符合于这些国家的经济利益。一九四九年，苏联在捷克对外贸易中将占第一位，而反转来，捷克也是苏联对外贸易中占最大数量的一个。苏、波贸易已远超过一九四八年缔结的五年协定中所订的目标。波兰人民言论报报导称，一九四八年，两国交换了价值二亿二千五百万美元的货物，而计划中所订的数目则为一亿七千万美元。苏联是波兰最大的顾主之一，而在战前，波兰对苏贸易在其对外总贸易中尚占不到百分之零·五。
    同样值得指出的是苏联与罗、保、匈之贸易的发展。根据不久前签订的协定，苏联与罗马尼亚之间一九四九年的商务要较一九四八年增加一倍半，双方各达四亿六千五百万卢布左右。苏联与保加利亚之间的贸易今年要增加百分之二十，而且苏联根据贷款协定要供给保加利亚的工业装备尚不计算在内。
    这些事实证明了：由于人民民主国家与苏联之间基于尊重彼此利益的经济合作，已开辟了集中各有关国家之丰富资源的广大可能性。
    经济委员会的设立是在这方面的又一步前进。委员会的目的是更加广大地发展其会员国之间的经济合作。委员会将根据平等代表权的原则，筹划集中经济上的经验，进行技术帮助，及以原料、食品、机器和装备相互援助等等。六国在经济方面的努力现在将更密切配合。现在它们有了新的机会以更充分更合适地利用这些国家的资源以利于人民。对于已经开始沿社会主义路线发展并使其计划经济臻于完善的人民民主国家说，能够在它们的经济活动上借助于苏联的强大社会主义工业与集体农业，对他们将有极大的价值。这一点，如象人民民主国家的报纸所指出的，保证了委员会各会员国免于遭受摇撼资本主义世界的残酷的经济危机的影响。
    同时，经济互助委员会也是防止帝国主义者干涉这些主权国家的内政及妨害其经济发展之一切企图的有力武器。
    美国独占资本熟习于西欧政客们的驯服和谄媚，而且不能容许拒绝服从马歇尔计划支配的国家和政府存在。马歇尔计划的发起人及其仆从们相当时日以来一直对人民民主国家及苏联实行实际上的贸易抵制。美国帝国主义显然以为他们的封锁会造成人民民主国家及苏联不可克服的困难。
    但现在可以保险的说，这个政策是失败了。在战前欧洲的情况下，经济上扼杀中、东欧中小国家的企图或许能够成功。但在目前情况下，这种企图是完全不能实现的。
    人民民主国家之间的经济合作及苏维埃国家的强有力的支持，已先行遏止了帝国主义者的努力。经济互助委员会的组成确定地打破了帝国主义者的希望，他们曾梦想成功地对民主与进步力量施用经济压力的武器。
    宣布该委员会之组成的声明强调它是一公开机构，凡赞同其原则愿望与首创国家进行广泛经济合作的其他欧洲国家，都可以参加。这一事实深得世界舆论的关注，因为它对持久和平与真诚国际合作的拥护者提出了新的远景和新的希望。
    经济互助委员会的建立是国际间具有最大的经济和政治重要性的事件。它证明了民主与社会主义力量的稳步增长与巩固。这些力量正奋力保证国家的和平发展与福利，他们的经济进步与政治独立。苏联人民欢呼经济互助委员会的组成及其基本原则，认为它是人民民主国家与苏联之间正在增长的新的真正的民主关系的反映。
