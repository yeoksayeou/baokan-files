Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 23rd: World democratic public opinion unanimously points out that the devaluation of the pound sterling is a shameful surrender by Britain to US imperialism. Moscow Radio's commentator, Leontiev, said: Regardless of the assurances of the Labor Party leaders, the British government has surrendered to the United States. Britain and other Western European countries could have escaped their financial difficulties with a very simple method. All they had to do was give up the ever-increasing huge military expenditures and stop the frantic preparations for a new war. But Wall Street's orders were exactly the opposite. The working people of Britain, France, and other Marshall Plan countries must now work harder and earn less. There is no question of reducing armaments, but rather of increasing them even more. "Guns instead of butter," that is the meaning of Wall Street's orders. The Polish People's Tribune published a special article entitled "The British Empire in a Big Sale," stating that the United States forced Britain to open its imperial doors at the Washington Conference so that Wall Street capital could infiltrate without restriction. Bevan and Cripps unanimously agreed to continue selling out the empire. Currently, this big sale is being conducted at reduced prices. Politicians from both the British Conservative and Labor parties no longer conceal that, through their mediation, the Anglo-American economic crisis has been transferred to the shoulders of the British people. The Warsaw newspaper pointed out: Now, American investors can acquire more property in Britain and Western Europe for the same amount of dollars. By devaluing the pound, American capitalists have abolished the last traces of the barriers surrounding the sterling area and paved a broad road for exporting the American crisis. The New York Worker, a US Communist newspaper, said: Our rich men have arranged a widespread attack on the living standards of the British people. This is a new trick for American capital to infiltrate the British Empire, and it is a British political crisis. After the fake socialists have committed this despicable and dirty deed, this political crisis may lead to the victory of the British Conservative Party. British progressive Member of Parliament Zilliacus said: The idea that the pound can improve our plummeting trade with the United States is insane. He urged doing business with the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, abandoning the North Atlantic Treaty, and stopping the arms race.

### 世界民主舆论评称：　英国贬低币值是向美帝投降

　　世界民主舆论评称：
  　英国贬低币值是向美帝投降
    【新华社北平廿三日电】世界民主舆论一致指出英镑贬值乃是英国对美帝国主义可耻的投降。莫斯科广播里昂捷也夫的评论称：不管工党领袖的种种保证，英国政府还是对美国投降了。英国及其他西欧国家本可借十分简单的办法就能逃出他们的财政困难。他们所必须做的一切，便是放弃不断增加的巨额军费，并停止对新战争的疯狂准备。但华尔街的命令却恰恰与此相反。英国、法国及其他马歇尔国家的劳动人民目前必须增加更多的工作，而获得更少的工资。军备更谈不上削减，反而还要更增加。“大炮代替牛油”这就是华尔街命令的意义。波兰人民论坛报发表题为“大拍卖中的英帝国”的专文称：美国在华盛顿会议上强迫英国开放帝国门户，以使华尔街资本无限制地渗入。贝文和克利浦斯一致同意继续出卖帝国。目前，这个大拍卖正在减价进行。英国保守党和工党两党的政治家，已不再隐瞒由于他们的媒介，英美经济危机已转嫁到英国人民的肩上。华沙报指出：现在美国投资者可以以同等数量的美元在英国和西欧获得更多的财产。美国资本家借英镑贬值废除了围绕着英镑区域的壁垒的最后痕迹，并铺平了输出美国危机的广阔道路。美共纽约工人日报说：我国的财主们安排好了对英国人民的生活水准实行广泛的攻击。这是美国资本渗入大英帝国的一套新花样，是英国的政治危机。在冒牌的社会主义分子干出了这件卑鄙龌龊的勾当后，这种政治危机可能引向英国保守党的胜利。英国进步议员齐里亚康斯说：认为英镑可以提高我们正走向暴跌的对美贸易的想法是在发疯。他力促与苏联及东欧做生意，抛弃北大西洋公约，停止军备竞争。
