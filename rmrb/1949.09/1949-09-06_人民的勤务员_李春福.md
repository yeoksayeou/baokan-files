　　The People's Servant—Li Chunfu
　　Feng Ping
　　Comrade Li Chunfu was a child from a poor family. When he was fourteen years old, his family couldn't afford to feed him, so his uncle, through connections in the city, got him a job as an apprentice in a blacksmith shop in Zhangjiakou. He got up early and went to bed late, was beaten and suffered abuse. The shopkeeper didn't treat him like a human being, and even the master who held the small hammer could beat and scold him. Li Chunfu was young and couldn't lift the fifteen-jin heavy hammer. He was so tired that he vomited blood, and he wasn't allowed to rest when he was sick. He had to sneak off to a deserted place to cry; if the shopkeeper saw him, he would be beaten severely again. Li Chunfu's childhood was spent in such painful and miserable days.
　　In the autumn of 1934, the People's Liberation Army liberated Zhangjiakou for the first time. Hundreds of thousands of oppressed people, under the leadership of the Communist Party, turned over a new leaf. Li Chunfu's days of suffering also came to an end. Since the arrival of the Communist Party, the shopkeeper and the master craftsmen dared not treat him unreasonably anymore. He was a person, a person who was respected. When he thought of this, he couldn't help but feel deeply moved from the bottom of his heart. He knew who gave him this freedom and happiness, so he decided to join the Communist Party. Li Chunfu embraced this ideal and went to "Lian Da" (United University) to work as a cook. In the winter of 1935, our army made a strategic withdrawal from Zhangjiakou, and Li Chunfu followed "Lian Da" to Fuping. In the nearly two years of work, he showed loyalty and responsibility, and soon he was approved to be a glorious Communist Party member.
　　"Lian Da" merged with Northern University to become North China University, and Li Chunfu also went to North China University. At that time, the school lived in a village near Zhengding. One day it was my turn to help in the kitchen. We went to the kitchen and saw the cooks were busy working. Li Chunfu was kneading a large piece of dough, sweat soaking through his faded gray military uniform. He kept wiping the sweat from his face with the towel draped over his shoulder. When he saw us coming, he smiled at us; at this time, I didn't recognize that the most honest smiling person was Li Chunfu! He was short and fat, and his red cheeks showed a healthy and happy look.
　　"Comrades, can you do this work?" A playful cook said to us with a happy face.
　　"We can do it, comrades, if you eat, you have to know how to cook!"
　　"If we don't know how, we can learn from you!" another comrade said playfully.
　　We all started working. The cooks worked even harder. Li Chunfu happily sang the tune of Yang Bailao's appearance in "The White-Haired Girl". When he was about to sing the lyrics of Xi'er, he stopped.
　　"Sing! You sing very well."
　　"I don't know how to sing the rest."
　　"How about I teach you?"
　　"That's great, comrade!" He looked at me and smiled.
　　That's how we met Comrade Li Chunfu. The cooks affectionately called him Little Fatty. He loved to sing or play musical instruments. Once I saw him learning to play the erhu. Although he was just monotonously repeating the tune at the beginning of Erhuang, he played it with great interest. Now, he writes a diary every day and leads other cooks to study. These are all his achievements since he participated in revolutionary work. In his work, he never looked tired, and he never heard him fuss about any personal problems. He was always so energetic when he worked, pulling the bellows and cleaning the steamer parts, all small things he took seriously. He had a lot of faith among the cooks, and everyone who saw him would happily call him "Little Fatty."
　　Last October, we set off for Xingtai. During the 400-li march, Li Chunfu was always working actively. Under difficult conditions, he had to make good meals. He always said, "When walking, comrades should eat better." I remember once we lived in a small village, there were many people, and there wasn't enough millet to raise here, and it was far from the big village, and it was getting late, what should we do? Everyone was anxious. Li Chunfu was so anxious that he ran around, but there was no way. Later, he found a few turnips, which was considered a makeshift meal. He felt very uneasy and uncomfortable when he thought that he hadn't made a good meal for his comrades. When we were about to arrive in Xingtai, four cooks were so tired that two of them fell ill. Li Chunfu was strong and not afraid of hardship, so he worked even harder. When he arrived at his destination, he had lost a lot of weight, but his cheeks were still red.
　　After the summing up of the march to Xingtai, the election of marching role models began immediately. This was a sensational event, and the election campaign was very enthusiastic. At the election meeting, someone introduced Li Chunfu. The person who spoke only said half of Li Chunfu's model labor deeds during the march, and applause rang out from all around the venue, lasting for a long time, making the speaker feel that there was almost no need to introduce him further.
　　Li Chunfu was elected the first labor hero of the whole team in the march. At the celebration meeting, he was awarded a towel, two bars of "Red May" soap, a pencil, a notebook, and other items; in addition, the students rushed to make a "Red Star" out of red cloth. This "Red Star Medal" was worn on his chest by the student representative. Although the red star was made of cloth, in the eyes of all the comrades, it showed an extraordinary glory - Li Chunfu is our model hero. All the comrades were very excited. Applauding didn't seem to express their love for Comrade Li Chunfu anymore. In a burst of shouts of "take a plane", the comrades swarmed up, and Li Chunfu flew in the crowd. How glorious is our beloved cook, Comrade Li Chunfu!
　　At the celebration meeting, Li Chunfu talked about his bitter childhood. His voice trembled a little when he spoke. When he talked about how the master of the blacksmith shop once injured him with a fire stick, his eyes were full of tears, and he tightly clenched the corner of his front clothes and trembled. The hatred for the old society made every comrade deeply feel it. Then he said: "The reason why I joined the revolution is to never be a slave. I know that in other unliberated places, there are still thousands of people like me who are suffering, waiting for liberation, waiting for the Communist Party. We must take the spirit of not being afraid to sacrifice personal interests and resolutely revolutionize to the end for the interests of the people!"
　　Ah: "Personal interests", "People's interests", Li Chunfu's words, Li Chunfu's struggle deeds, drew a line in the thoughts of the students. The students said excitedly: Li Chunfu is the people's servant, and also an example for our students!

　　人民的勤务员—李春福
    冯平
    李春福同志是一个穷家的孩子，十四岁的时候，家里养活不起，由他舅父托城里人情面，投到张家口一家铁匠铺里当学徒。起早睡晚，挨打受气，掌柜不把他当人看，就是撑小铁锤的师父也可以打骂他。李春福年纪小，举不动十五斤重的大铁锤，累得吐血，病了不准休息，哭都得偷躲在没人的地方；要是被掌柜看见，又是没轻没重乱打一顿。李春福的童年就是活在这样痛苦悲惨的日子里。
    三十四年秋天，人民解放军第一次解放了张家口。成千成万被压迫的人民，在共产党领导下翻身了。李春福苦难的日子也熬到尽头。自从有了共产党，掌柜的及大师父再不敢无理对待他，他是一个人，是一个被人看得起的人了，当他想到这些就不由得从心里深深地感动起来。他知道这些自由与幸福是谁给予他的，所以他决定了参加共产党。李春福抱着这理想到“联大”，担任炊事员工作。三十五年冬天，我军从张家口作战略撤退，李春福随“联大”到阜平。这将近两年来的工作，他表现得忠诚负责，不久他就被批准为光荣的共产党员了。
    “联大”与北方大学合并成为华北大学，李春福也到了华北大学。那时，学校住在正定附近的一个村庄。有一天轮到我去厨房帮忙做饭，我们到厨房里，看见炊事员同志正忙着工作。李春福揉着一大块面，汗水渗透了他褪色的灰军衣，他不断地用肩上搭的毛巾擦去脸上的汗。看见我们来了，向我们笑着；这时，我还不曾认得那个笑得最憨人的就是李春福呢！他矮而胖，红红的双颊显出健康愉快的神色。
    “同志们，你们干得了这活计吗？”一个俏皮的炊事员同志喜眉笑脸地对我们说。
    “干得了，同志，吃饭就得会做饭呀！”
    “我们不会可以向你们学习！”另一位同志俏皮地说。
    我们大家动起手来。炊事员同志干得更有劲了。李春福愉快地唱起“白毛女”杨白老登场的曲子来，当他要唱喜儿歌辞的时候，他停下了。
    “唱呀！你唱得很好。”
    “后面不会唱了。”
    “我来教你好吗？”
    “太好啦，同志！”他瞅着我笑着。
    我们就这样认识了李春福同志。炊事员同志都亲热地叫他小胖子。他喜爱唱歌或弄乐器，有一次我看见他在学拉胡琴，虽然只是单调地重复拉二簧开始的那个调，他却十分有兴致地拉着。现在，他每天要写日记，并领导其他炊事员同志学习，这些都是他参加革命工作以后的成就。在工作中，从没看见他疲倦的样子，也没听说他闹什么个人问题，做起活来什么时候都是那么有劲，拉风箱，清理蒸笼件件小事都很认真。他在炊事员同志间很有信仰，谁见了他都会高兴地叫他一声“小胖子”。
    去年十月间，我们出发到邢台，四百里行军，李春福一直是在积极地工作着。在困难的条件下，他要把饭做好，他总是说：“走路的时候，更应该让同志们吃好饭。”记得一次我们住在一个小村庄上，人多，这里筹借不出那么多小米，离大村庄路又远，天晚了，怎么办呢？大家在焦虑，李春福急得跑来跑去，没有办法，后来找来不多些蔓菁，算凑合着吃了一顿饭。他想到没使同志们吃好饭，感到很不安，很难受。快到邢台的时候，四个炊事员累得病倒两个。李春福身体结实，不怕吃苦，工作更忙了，到目的地，他瘦了很多，只是双颊还是红红的。
    到邢台行军总结完毕，随即开始了行军英模选举。这是件轰轰烈烈的事，竞选活动很热烈。竞选大会上，有人替李春福作介绍，讲话的人介绍李春福在行军中的劳动模范事迹只说了一半，掌声从会场四下便响起来，历久不停，使讲话的人感到几乎没有再介绍的必要了。
    李春福当选了行军中全队第一名劳动英雄，在庆功大会上，奖给他一条毛巾，两条“红五月”肥皂和铅笔、笔记本等物；另外是同学们用红布赶制的一颗“红星”，这“红星奖章”由同学代表给他戴在胸前，红星虽系布质，在全体同志心目中，却显示了一种不平凡的荣耀——李春福是我们大家的模范英雄。全体同志情绪非常激动，鼓掌似乎已不是表现对李春福同志的热爱了，在一阵“坐飞机”的喊声下，同志们蜂涌上去，李春福在簇拥的人群里飞舞起来，我们亲爱的炊事员李春福同志多么光荣啊！
    庆功大会上，李春福讲到自己童年悲苦的身世。他讲话的声音有些颤抖，当讲到铁匠铺师父有一次用火棒打伤他的时候，他眼泪满眶，手紧握前襟衣角抖着，对旧社会的愤恨，使每个同志都深切的感觉到了。接着他说：“为什么参加了革命，就是为了永远不做奴隶，我知道在其他没有解放的地方，还有千千万万象我一样受苦受难的人们，在等待解放，等待共产党。我们要以不怕牺牲个人利益的精神，坚决为人民利益革命到底！”
    啊：“个人利益”，“人民利益”，李春福的话，李春福的斗争事迹，给同学们在思想上划了一道界线，同学们激动地说着：李春福是人民的勤务员，也是我们同学的榜样！
