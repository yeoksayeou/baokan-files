Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 1st: TASS quoted the Swedish newspaper Nydag as reporting: Yugoslav General Staff Colonel Slobodan Sekic, recently arrived in Sweden as a Yugoslav sports representative and refused to return to his country. He published a statement in the newspaper, revealing the Tito clique's recent implementation of fascist rule and persecution in the Yugoslav army. The statement said: After Tito threw himself into the imperialist camp, Rankovic's secret police arrested large numbers of communists and all patriots willing to cooperate with the Soviet Union, people's democracies, and world democratic forces every day. Many military officers were tortured to death after being arrested. The Tito clique tried to "purge" dissidents in the army, wanting to turn the army into an obedient tool to suppress mass struggle, organize provocations on the borders of people's democratic countries, and incite anti-Soviet war. For example, after an uprising in the Bilopolje (west of Novi Pazar) area, Tito sent a division from the Sarajevo Military Region to suppress it, killing fourteen members of the Communist District Committee and arresting four in the massacre. But the Tito gang has difficulty realizing these plans. Opposition to Tito's policies is growing in the army and is being waged in various ways.

Minister of the Interior Rankovic sent a secret order to Tito's special agent in the army, Major General Avdo Cukic, to arrest all "unstable" military officers. As a result, Major General Mirko Krdic, Major General Vilko Micic, and others have recently been arrested. Krdic was the chairman of the Supreme Court of the Yugoslav Army, and Vilko Micic was the military prosecutor. They were arrested for refusing to pass judgments against patriots who spoke out against Tito's traitorous policies. At a recent party meeting, Major Danil Militic, who could no longer tolerate the insults to the Soviet Union, said, "Stop the anti-Soviet policy at last." He was immediately arrested. Then Ilija Jerkavic also disappeared. Twenty days later, it was learned that he had indeed been arrested. Similar situations occur daily in the Yugoslav army. The Tito clique intends to turn the Yugoslav army into a tool to realize its anti-national and traitorous plans, but the officers and soldiers of the army will not allow it to hand over the country to American imperialism.

　　铁托集团残害爱国军官胁迫挑衅煽动反苏战争
  　塞基区上校抵瑞典后揭露
    【新华社北平一日电】塔斯社引瑞典尼达格报载消息称：南斯拉夫参谋总部斯洛波丹·塞基区上校，近以南斯拉夫体育代表的身份到达瑞典后即拒绝返国，并在该报上发表声明，揭露铁托集团最近在南斯拉夫军队中实行法西斯统治与迫害的情形。声明说：铁托投入帝国主义阵营后，兰科维奇秘密警察每日大批逮捕共产党人和一切愿与苏联、人民民主国家以及世界民主力量合作的爱国者。许多军官在被捕后被拷打致死。铁托集团力图在军队中“清洗”异己分子，想把军队变为顺从的工具以镇压群众斗争，并组织在人民民主国家边境上的挑衅行动及煽动反苏战争。例如在比洛波尔（诺维巴萨之西）地区发生起义后，铁托即派出塞拉热窝军区一师团前往镇压，在这次屠杀中杀死了共产党区委员会委员十四名，逮捕四名。但铁托匪帮很难实现这些计划，军队中反对铁托政策的情绪，正在增长并采各种方式进行斗争。
    内政部长兰科维奇致铁托在军队中的特务头子艾夫脱·索西区少将一项密令，逮捕一切“不稳”的军官，结果，米尔柯·克尔迪区少将，维尔柯·米齐区少将及其他人已于最近被逮捕。克尔迪区曾任南斯拉夫军队最高法庭主席，维尔柯·米齐区曾任军事检察长。他们因拒绝通过对声言反对铁托叛国政策的爱国者所作的判决而被逮捕。在最近党的会议上，不再能忍受对苏联的侮辱的达尼尔·米里提区少校曾经发言说：“最后停止反苏政策吧”。他立即被逮捕了。接着伊里亚·杰里夫斯基也失踪了，二十天以后，才知道他确已被捕。南斯拉夫军队中每日也发生类似的情况。铁托集团打算将南斯拉夫军队变为用以实现其反民族与叛国计划的工具，但军队的官兵们是不会允许它把国家交给美国帝国主义的。
