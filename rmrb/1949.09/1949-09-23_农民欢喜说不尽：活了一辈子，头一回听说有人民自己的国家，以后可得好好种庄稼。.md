　　Peasants Can't Stop Cheering:
    Lived a lifetime, first time hearing of a country of our own people, must farm well in the future.
    The peasants in the Ping suburbs are overjoyed to hear the news of the opening of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. Chai Zemin, the director of the newly established Preparatory Committee of the Beiping Municipal Farmers' Association, said: "Peasant representatives account for sixteen of the group representatives of the CPPCC, and peasant representatives account for two in the presidium of the conference. This shows how the status of peasants has been improved. Peasants have not only achieved a great turnaround in politics but also in the economy. This is unprecedented in history. This is the result of the heroic struggle of the people of the whole country under the leadership of the Communist Party." He said: "The people's country needs the people to build it. Chairman Mao said, 'Economic construction work on a national scale has already been placed before us. In the future, under the leadership of our own country, we must learn from the advanced construction experience of our international friends—the Soviet Union—and gradually turn China's backward individual small-scale peasant economy into a collective and move towards socialization, and work hard with our worker brothers to complete the economic construction tasks of the new China!'"
    Liu Jianshan, a peasant from Majiabao Village in the southern suburbs of Ping City, said: "I have lived my whole life, and this is the first time I have heard of the emergence of our own people's country. In the past, Chiang Kai-shek ruined the common people. Our poor people could not go to the yamen to reason with the Kuomintang government. Just take Yang Jinfang, the puppet Bao chief of our village, as an example. He would hit people as soon as he spoke. No one in the village did not say that he was privately setting up a court. At that time, we could only swallow our anger." He continued: "This CPPCC truly represents the people. There are also workers and rural women (referring to Rong Guanxiu) among the representatives. Like the Kuomintang in Beiping in the past, it should be called electing senators, but I know that Zhang Wenkui in the southern suburbs is a big businessman who started by speculating in grain trading. When electing senators, he spent 60 million yuan in pseudo currency to treat the Bao chiefs as guests and bribe them to vote for him. What kind of democracy is this! I am old, and now that we have established our own government, I will have a few years of comfortable life." Sun Baoxiang, the village chief of the village, said: "In the past, no one in the Kuomintang government listened to the poor, and what the rich said was right even if it was wrong. We had no place to complain about any grievances and injustices. Wang Wenxiu's wife sought death because she was raped by the puppet Bao chief and had no place to reason. Now the days of oppression are finally over. In the future, we must farm well, lead the masses to produce, and make the village people's government well."
    The Nanyuan Town Office of the Fourteenth District in the suburbs also plans to convene a mass meeting tonight to spread this exciting news, so that more peasants who have turned over can be excited and encouraged.

　　农民欢喜说不尽：
    活了一辈子，头一回听说有人民自己的国家，以后可得好好种庄稼。
    平郊农民听到人民政协开会的消息都欢欣若狂。新近成立的北平市农会筹备委员会主任柴泽民说：“人民政协的团体代表中，农民代表占了十六人，在大会主席团中农民代表占了二人，这说明农民的地位是如何的被提高了。农民不仅是在政治上而且在经济上也获得了大翻身。这是空前的历史上没有过的事，这都是在共产党领导下全国人民英勇斗争的结果。”他说：“人民的国家就需要人民来建设，毛主席说‘全国规模的经济建设工作业已摆在我们面前，今后在自己国家的领导下，我们一定要学习先进的国际朋友——苏联底建设经验，把中国落后的个体的小农经济逐渐转向集体，走向社会化，和工人兄弟一起努力，完成新中国的经济建设任务！’”
    平市南郊马家堡村农民刘建山说：“我活了一辈子，头一回听说产生咱们人民自己的国家。以前蒋介石可把老百姓糟塌坏了，国民党的政府咱穷人那能进衙门讲理，就说咱村杨金方伪保长吧，一说话就是动手打人，乡亲们谁不说他是私立公堂，那时只有忍气吞声。”他接着说：“这回的人民政协真是代表人民的，代表中还有工人和农村妇女（指戎冠秀），象过去国民党在北平，应名叫选参议员，可是我知道的南郊张文魁是个以买卖粮食投机倒把起家的大商人，选参议员时他花了六千万伪法币请保长的客，给他贿选，这叫什么民主啊！我老了，咱成立了自己的政府，今后也过几年舒心光景吧。”该村村长孙宝香说：“以前国民党政府是穷人说话没人听，有钱人说话不对也是香的，受多大冤枉和委屈也无处诉说，王文秀的妻子因被伪保长强奸没处说理寻了死。现在受压迫的日子总算熬过去了，以后可得好好种庄稼，领导群众生产，把村人民政府弄得好好的。”
    郊十四区南苑镇公所并计划在今晚召集群众大会，把这个兴奋的消息传播出去，让更多的翻了身的农民们兴奋和鼓舞。
