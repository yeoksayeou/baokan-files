    World Federation of Trade Unions General Secretary Attends and Calls for Resolute Struggle Against Warmongers
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 5th] According to TASS: The Netherlands Progressive Trade Union Federation, affiliated with the World Federation of Trade Unions, held its second congress in Amsterdam starting on August 31st. More than 5,000 representatives from all over the country and trade union delegations from France and Luxembourg attended. World Federation of Trade Unions General Secretary Saillant also attended in person. The main speaker at the conference was Blokzijl, a member of the Central Executive Committee of the Netherlands Progressive Trade Union Federation, who gave a report on the struggle of the Dutch working people for their rights, peace, and democracy. Blokzijl emphasized that the Netherlands Progressive Trade Union Federation fully supports the World Federation of Trade Unions and uses all methods to consolidate the united front of working people all over the world, led by the Soviet Union. He pointed out that the implementation of the Marshall Plan and the result of aggressive military preparations have caused the economic situation in the Netherlands to continue to deteriorate. He further pointed out that the forces of peace are stronger than the forces of war. The Dutch working people, like the millions of working people in other countries of Western Europe, are willing to maintain lasting friendly relations with the Soviet Union. Blokzijl said: We protest against the reactionary policies of our government. This policy cannot represent the will of the people. The people demand that the government reject the North Atlantic aggressive pact. Finally, he sternly rebuked the Dutch trade unionist Kupers, an American-British imperialist lackey who attempted to split the unity of the trade union movement. Saillant, on behalf of the World Federation of Trade Unions, paid tribute to the Dutch working people and called on them to further consolidate the unity of the peace front and exert greater efforts to fight against the instigators of a new war.
