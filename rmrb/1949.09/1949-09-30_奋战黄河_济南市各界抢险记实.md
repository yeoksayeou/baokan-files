　　Fighting the Yellow River
  　A True Record of the Rescue Efforts of All Circles in Jinan
    By Our Correspondent in Jinan Chen Yongjin
    In mid-September, continuous rain fell over the 8,800-li Yellow River. Heavy rain in the Northwest had lasted for ten days. The flow of the Yellow River at Shanzhou had reached 15,000 cubic meters per second. On the 14th, the Changqing section of Jinan began to rise. Kang Sheng and Guo Zihua, the Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, and Yao Zhongming, the Mayor of Jinan, issued an emergency order to all the people, organizations, troops, factories, schools, and farmers in the six districts of Changqing on the 15th, calling for "Resisting the Flood and Defending Jinan." Immediately, the whole city was boiling in response to the call from higher authorities.

    Along the 70-li Yellow River embankment from Jinan to Changqing, there were nearly 20,000 people fighting the Yellow River. On the embankment, the roar of trucks carrying soil and stone, the shouts of carters, the singing of people, and the gongs and drums of the慰问团 (comfort groups/visiting groups) were all mixed together, drowning out the roar of the Yellow River. At night, tens of thousands of lights shone on both banks, and people calmly inspected the dikes like shuttles, preparing to fight the flood.

    The Beidianzi dangerous section in the southwest corner of Jinan was guarded by more than 1,000 officers and soldiers of the Jinan Garrison and more than 2,000 farmers from Changqing County. Like a battle, they ran the soil and stones from hundreds of meters away to the dike. After two days, the arms of all the officers and soldiers of the 7th Company on the Beidianzi dangerous section were swollen, but they fought more and more bravely.

    The veterans at the Luokou large dangerous section were working as hard as the workers, farmers, and other staff. Communist Party members Yu Wenting and Zhou Guogong, who had serious lung injuries in the Jinan Campaign, had inflammation of their wounds due to excessive wading in muddy water and carrying soil for rescue. Liu Jinghan, a combat model in the Huaihai Campaign, also actively wanted to participate in the rescue despite having an inflamed wound for two days without eating. He was finally ordered back to the rear by his superiors.

    The dangerous section from east of the Luokou Yellow River Railway Bridge to Gejiagou was defended by more than 3,000 employees of the Railway Bureau and farmers from the northern rural areas of Jinan. Here, we can see the combination of workers and farmers, with workers transporting soil and farmers driving piles. Section workers Zhang Huaiyin and Xu Shizhen created the miracle of carrying 400 jin of soil from 50 meters away.

    The section of dangerous work from Luokou West to Yangzhuang, due to the many trenches dug by the Kuomintang bandit army in the past, experienced 89 incidents of danger in the five days from the 15th to the 20th. Thanks to the day and night rescue by the defending office cadres and school teachers and students, the situation was finally turned from danger to safety.

    The people of Jinan also clearly knew that this flood was much larger than the one in 1937 (when it was 32.14 meters, the Yellow River breached its banks, and Jinan City was flooded). From the 15th, it began to rise to 31.14 meters (above sea level) and reached 32.34 meters on the 23rd. Under the slogan of "As the water rises, so does the dike," people fought tensely for ten days and nights. Although their eyes were red from exhaustion, their energy was still so abundant. Finally, the turbulent Yellow River was tamed in the hands of the people, and it slowly subsided. The 24th, the day of celebrating the founding of the new China and the first anniversary of the liberation of Jinan, was also the day when the Yellow River water largely receded and the heroes who fought the flood returned in triumph.

　　奋战黄河
  　济南市各界抢险记实
    本报驻济记者  陈勇进
    九月中旬，八千八百里黄河上阴雨连绵，西北大雨十日未停，陕州黄水流量已达一万五千秒立方公尺，十四日，济南长清段开始上涨。山东省政府康生、郭子化正副主席，济南市姚仲明市长于十五日向济南市全体人民、机关团体、部队、工厂、学校及长清六区农民发布了“抵抗洪水、保卫济南”的紧急命令。立刻，全市都为响应上级号召而沸腾起来。
    从济南到长清七十里黄河堤上，布满了近两万与黄河作战的人们。堤上，运送土、石的汽车吼叫声，车马吆喊声，人们歌唱声与慰问团的锣鼓声，热闹的搅成一团，使黄河的咆哮声消失了；入夜，两岸灯火万千，人们镇静地如梭似地检查察看堤坝，准备与洪水搏斗。
    济南西南角北店子险工，是济南警备部队千余指战员与长清县两千余农民看守，他们象战斗一样的将土、石从数百米以外跑步运到堤坝上，两天后，北店子险工上第七连的全体指战员膀子都被压肿了，但他们是愈战愈奋。
    洛口大险工上的荣军们，与工人、农民及其他机关人员一样的紧张工作。济南战役肺部负重伤的共产党员于文廷、周国功，他们由于过度的淌泥水抬土抢险而伤口发炎了；淮海战役中战斗模范刘景寒，伤口发炎两天不吃饭，亦积极要去抢险，最后被首长命令回到后方去。
    洛口黄河铁桥以东至盖家沟的险工，是铁路局三千余职工和济市北部农村的农民防守，在这里可看到工人与农民的结合，工人运土、农民打桩。段工张怀印、徐士珍则创造了从五十米远扛土四百斤的奇迹。
    从洛口西到杨庄的一段险工，因国民党匪军过去曾挖过很多壕沟，故在十五至二十的五天中即出险八十九次，由于防守的机关干部与学校师生昼夜抢救，终于转危为安。
    济南人民还清楚的知道：这比一九三七年的水大多了（按当时为三二·一四公尺，黄河决口，济南城被淹），从十五号开始上涨为三一·一四公尺（拔海）至二十三日为三二·三四公尺，人们在“水长堤高”的口号下，紧张战斗十昼夜，虽然他们的眼睛已经熬红了，而精力还是那样充沛。终于使万涛奔腾的黄河在人民手里消灭了它的威风，慢慢小下来。二十四日，在庆祝新中国成立，庆祝济南解放一周年的时候，也正是黄河水大部下落，与洪水搏斗的英雄们凯旋回来的日子。
