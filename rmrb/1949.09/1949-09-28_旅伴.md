　　Fellow Travelers
　　By Soviet author Pan Nuowa, translated by Su Ling, proofread by Cao Jinghua

　　Part One: Night
　　Chapter Four: Yulia

　　Suprunov and Danilov returned to the train.
　　He had also spent the entire night running through the city under fire, bandaging the wounded. In reality, with his frail body, it was impossible to do this kind of work. Excited nerves supported him. When shells exploded near him, he didn't tremble; he was like an observer, as if seeing himself in this night from high in the sky. Similarly, he seemed to see this heartening scene from the side, from a high altitude: a doctor returning from the perilous battlefield where he could die or be crippled every second. The shoulders of this dedicated and heroic doctor were pierced by shrapnel. He was exhausted, as black as a negro; his cuffs and the knees of his breeches were soaked in blood. His feet were also chafed by his boots... But he gathered his strength, grabbed the handrail, and boarded the command car. The cook Finma was so frightened that she dodged away...
　　"Get hot water!" he said to her as he walked. "Bring a clean dressing gown, and wash this one today."
　　Finma glanced at Suprunov with loyal eyes and ran to fetch water...
　　"Smirnova!" Suprunov shouted to the nurse running past in the corridor. "Tell the housekeeping nurse to get breakfast ready for me."
　　She peered into the room and saw his negro's head and blood-soaked, roughened wrists; she turned sharply and ran to the kitchen.
　　"Ha, she ran!" Suprunov said to himself.
　　He took off his shirt, loosened his suspenders, and deliberately went to wash his face casually. Finma followed him, walking lightly on tiptoe, carrying a pot of hot water in her hand. He stretched his palm towards her:
　　"Pour!"
　　The charred, blackened ambulance with broken windows returned to the rear. A scorched carriage was attached to the rear of the train. A green light shone in front of the train, and other trains yielded the way.
　　(End of Part One)

　　Editor's Note:
　　Part One of "Fellow Travelers" concludes today. As the book is about to be published as a separate volume, this publication will not continue serializing Part Two.

    第一部　夜
    第四章　尤丽
    苏普鲁戈夫同达尼洛夫回到列车上来了。
    他也是整夜在炮火下遍城跑着，去替受伤的裹着伤。实际上，以他那样瘦弱的身体，作这种工作是不行的。兴奋的神经支持着他。当炮弹在他附近爆炸的时候，他并不发抖；他仿佛旁观者似的，仿佛从高空中在这夜里看见自己似的。同样的，他仿佛从旁边，从高空看见了这一幅令人欣慰的画面：一位医生从那每秒钟都可以令他死或令他残废的险危的战场上回来了。这位献身而英勇的医生制服的肩上，都被弹片穿破了。他疲惫得要命，黑得好象黑人似的；他的袖口和马裤的膝盖上，都被血浸透了。脚也被靴子磨破了……可是他鼓了鼓气，抓着扶手，上了司令车上。厨女芬玛叫他吓得闪开来……
    “拿热水来！”他走着对她说道。“拿一件干净的衣罩来，把这一件今天就洗一洗。”
    芬玛用忠实的眼光，把苏普鲁戈夫看了一眼，就跑去打水去了………
    “斯密诺瓦！”苏普鲁戈夫向从走廊里跑过去的护士喊了一声。“告诉庶务护士，叫给我开早餐吧。”
    他脱了外衣。斯密诺瓦往房里一望，就看见了他的黑人的头和血浸得变粗糙了的手脖，她猛烈转回身来，跑到厨房去了。
    “呵哈，可跑了！”苏普鲁戈夫自言自语着。
    他裸着上身，把背带放下来，故意随随便便的去洗脸去了。芬玛跟在他后边，轻轻的用脚尖走着，手里提着一壶热水。他把手掌对她伸着：
    “倒！”
    烤焦了的，熏黑了的，窗子都打碎了的救护车，回到后方来了。一辆四面烧焦了的车厢，挂在车尾上。绿灯在列车前面照耀着，其他的列车都给它让着道路。
