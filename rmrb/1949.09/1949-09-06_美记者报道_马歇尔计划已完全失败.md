Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 5th: A dispatch from TASS New York acknowledges the growing difficulties of the Marshall Plan countries and the bankruptcy of the Marshall Plan. Although New York Times reporter Callender reported that the Marshall Plan countries finally reached an agreement on the allocation of this year's Marshall Plan appropriations on August 31, he emphasized that the amount of appropriations that could be obtained was far from meeting the needs of the Marshall Plan countries. Callender reported that Britain reluctantly agreed to accept $962 million (Britain originally requested $1.512 billion) as its share. Other countries receiving appropriations, with the exception of Belgium and Trieste, also complained that the funds they received were insufficient. The total amount of appropriations by the Council of the "European Economic Cooperation Administration" was only $3.78 billion, and the Council hoped that the US Congress would approve "at least this amount." Callender pointed out that even if the US Congress approved this amount, it would not be enough to solve the growing financial crisis of the Marshall Plan countries. Callender pointed out that in the second quarter of this year, the continental Marshall Plan countries had a serious drop in income from exports of dollar goods, and it is expected to continue to fall. He emphasized that the US Congress is bound to cut Marshall Plan funds, which makes the problems of the Marshall Plan countries even more serious at a time when the dollar shortage in Western Europe is increasing.

The Compass Daily published a dispatch from its Paris correspondent White, stating that "the Marshall Plan is failing." White declared that almost every senior official associated with the Marshall Plan would admit this, but none of them could offer a solution. White said that the so-called MacDougall Report, which has been kept secret so far—a report prepared by experts from the Council of the "European Economic Cooperation Administration" for the US Economic Cooperation Administration—admits that the Marshall Plan has failed. White declared that this report so shocked Hoffman's deputy, Bissell, that Bissell tried to prevent Western European countries from publishing the report to the press, because Bissell feared that the report would shock the US Congress and completely abandon the Marshall Plan.

  　马歇尔计划已完全失败
    【新华社北平五日电】塔斯社纽约讯：来自巴黎的消息承认马歇尔计划国家的日益困难和马歇尔计划的破产。纽约时报的记者卡兰达虽然报道马歇尔计划国家在八月三十一日终于对本年度马歇尔计划拨款的分配额达到了协议，但他却强调说：可能得到的拨款数量，远不足马歇尔计划国家的需要。卡兰达报道说：英国勉强地同意接受九亿六千二百万美元（英国原要求十五亿一千二百万美元）作为英国的一份。其他接受拨款之国家，除比利时和的里雅斯特以外，也都抱怨它们得到的款项不够。“欧洲经济合作局”理事会的拨款总数仅为三十七亿八千万美元，理事会希望美国国会批准“至少这个数目”。卡兰达指出：但是，即使是美国国会批准了这个数目，它也不足以解决马歇尔计划国家日益增长的财政危机。卡兰达指出：本年第二季中，大陆上的马歇尔计划国家，在美元货物出口之收入方面有严重的下跌，而且预料还将下跌。他强调称：美国国会势将削减马歇尔计划的款项，当此西欧国家美元荒日益增加之时，使马计国家的问题益趋严重。
    指南针日报刊载海外通讯社驻巴黎记者怀特的通讯称，“马歇尔计划在失败中”。怀特宣称：几乎每一个与马歇尔计划有关的高级官员，都会承认这一点，但他们中间没有一个人能提供解决的意见。怀特说：迄今保持秘密的所谓麦克道格尔报告——“欧洲经济合作局”理事会的专家们为美国经合总署而作的报告——承认马歇尔计划失败了。怀特宣称：这一报告如此地震惊了霍夫曼的副手比歇尔，以致比歇尔设法使西欧国家，不向报界发表这一报告。因为比歇尔害怕报告会使得美国国会震惊而完全抛弃马歇尔计划。
