　　The Preparatory Committee of the All-China Soviet Friendship Association and the Preparatory Committee of the Representatives' Conference of Natural Science Workers held a meeting at the auditorium of Peking Union Medical College at 10:00 AM on the 26th to commemorate the centenary of the birth of the great Soviet scientist Pavlov. Attendees included Soong Ching Ling, Dong Biwu, Shen Junru, Guo Moruo, Huang Yanpei, Ma Xulun, Yan Baohang, Shao Lizi, Liang Xi, Lu Zhiwei, Zeng Zhaolun, Zhu Kezhen, Hou Debang, He Cheng, Mao Yisheng, Ye Qisun, Rao Yutai, and 106 others. Chairman Guo Moruo, in his opening address, listed Pavlov's various scientific achievements and pointed out: "Pavlov is not only a great Soviet scientist, but also a world scientist because his science is universal. His scientific achievements mark the victory of science over metaphysics and materialism over idealism." He continued: "Today, as we commemorate Pavlov, we must thank him for his nearly sixty years of scientific achievement. We must not only learn from his tireless work, but also from his love for his motherland. After the success of the October Revolution in the Soviet Union, which suffered armed intervention and blockade by sixteen capitalist countries, enemy countries extended olive branches to Pavlov, but were rejected. He resolutely stayed in Russia and resolutely conducted scientific research for his country." Finally, he said: "Pavlov was treated coldly in the Tsarist era, but after the October Revolution, he received special care from Lenin and Stalin, who established research institutes for him during the country's most difficult times. After Pavlov's death, the research institutes were further expanded and increased. This fact proves that only under the leadership of the Communist Party can academic research be truly respected, and only then can scientific development have a greater future." Then, Wu Yuzhang, President of North China University, spoke, emphasizing Pavlov's greatness in obeying the truth and not blindly believing in old doctrines. He also said: "The Political Consultative Conference has already opened, and a new regime is about to be born. It needs a large number of scientific workers to participate in the construction work, to learn from Pavlov to work for the new country, and to dedicate science to the motherland." Following this, Lu Zhiwei, President of Yenching University, Zhang Xiaoqian, Director of Internal Medicine at Peking Union Medical College, and Xu Yingkui, Director of the Department of Neurology at Peking University Medical College, respectively reported on Pavlov's contributions to psychology, clinical medicine, and psychiatry. Lu particularly pointed out: Based on Pavlov's life, a superstition has been shattered—the "lack of freedom for scientific research under socialism" propagated by the bourgeoisie. Finally, Zhang Xijun, Dean of Academic Affairs and Director of the Department of Physiology at Peking Union Medical College, demonstrated Pavlov's experiment on a dog's gastric fistula. The meeting concluded at 12:10 PM. (Image attached)

    郭沫若、吴玉章等号召科学工作者学习巴夫洛夫把科学贡献给新国家
    【本报讯】中苏友好协会总会筹备委员会和中华自然科学工作者代表大会筹委会二十六日上午十时在北平协和医学院礼堂集会，纪念苏联伟大科学家巴夫洛夫诞生一百周年。到会者有宋庆龄、董必武、沈钧儒、郭沫若、黄炎培、马叙伦、阎宝航、邵力子、梁希、陆志韦、曾昭抡、竺可桢、侯德榜、贺诚、茅以升、叶企荪、饶毓泰等一百零六人。主席郭沫若在致开会词中历述马夫洛夫在科学上多种成就之后指出：“巴夫洛夫不仅是苏联伟大的科学家，由于其科学有世界性，所以可称是世界的科学家。他在科学上的成就，标志了科学战胜了形而上学，唯物论战胜了唯心论。”继称：“今天我们纪念巴夫洛夫，要感谢他约略六十年的科学成绩。我们不仅要学习他孜孜不倦地工作，同时也要学习他热爱祖国的精神。苏联十月革命成功后，曾遭受十六个资本主义国家武装干涉和封锁，敌系国家曾向巴夫洛夫招手，但遭到了拒绝，他坚决留在俄罗斯，坚决为祖国科学进行研究。”最后他说：“巴夫洛夫在帝俄时代很受冷遇，但自十月革命以后，受着列宁和斯大林的特别关心，在国家极艰难的时候为他设立了研究所。在巴夫洛夫逝世后，研究所更扩大且增多了。这一件事实证明：只有在共产党领导之下，学术研究才真正受到尊重，科学发展也才有更大的前途。”继由华北大学校长吴玉章讲话，他着重指出巴夫洛夫服从真理不迷信旧学说的伟大。他并说：“政治协商会议已经开幕了，新的政权就要诞生，需要广大的科学工作者参加建设工作，学习巴夫洛夫为新国家工作，把科学贡献给祖国。”接着有燕京大学校长陆志韦、协和医学院内科主任张孝骞、北大医学院神经系主任许英魁分别报告巴夫洛夫对心理学、临诊医学以及精神病学上的供献。陆氏并特别指出：根据巴夫洛夫的生活，破除了一种迷信——资产阶级所宣传的“社会主义无科学研究的自由”。最后由协和医学院教务长兼生理系主任张锡钧示范巴夫洛夫研究狗的胃囊的实验。午十二时十分会毕。（附图片）
