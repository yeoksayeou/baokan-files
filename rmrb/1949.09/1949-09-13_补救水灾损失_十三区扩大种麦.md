　　Remedy Flood Losses
　  Thirteen Districts Expand Wheat Planting
    [Reported by this newspaper] The thirteen suburban districts plan to expand wheat planting to remedy flood losses. Last year, the district planted 37,644 mu of wheat, accounting for 23 percent of the total cultivated area. This year, it plans to plant more than 48,900 mu, accounting for about 28 percent of the cultivated area, and strive to plant even more. According to farmers, there has been a lot of rain this year, and the wheat harvest next year will be good, so they are confident in planting wheat. However, some farmers lack wheat seeds and still rely on government relief. The district has convened a meeting of district and village cadres, discussed the matter in detail, arranged the wheat planting work, and formed a district production committee led by relevant departments to provide unified leadership. The district can solve 373,581 jin of wheat seeds on its own; 234,530 jin need to be exchanged; and 76,230 jin still cannot be solved. At the district and village cadre meeting, it was decided to mobilize farmers to lend and adjust to each other on a voluntary basis, and to exchange public grain stored in the villages for seeds to lend to poor farmers. If this is still not enough, a loan will be requested from the bank. The People's Bank has already lent the district 35,000 jin of wheat seeds, 50,000 jin of fertilizer, and 50,000 jin for exchanging wheat seeds. The district is currently discussing and studying the seed loans, focusing on lending to the Dongba and Qikeshu administrative villages, which have been severely affected by disasters. They are currently understanding the situation of the 50,000 jin of fertilizer and exchanged seeds and preparing for distribution. In terms of labor and animal power, they are mobilizing to organize mutual aid and exchange labor and adjust animal power on the principle of mutual benefit and voluntarism. The district has 3,051 heads of livestock. If adjusted appropriately, so that households with livestock do not suffer losses, the autumn plowing problem can be solved. At the same time, it also calls on everyone to work, mobilize women to help each other, and pay attention to ensuring the autumn harvest and wheat planting of dependents of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers and poor, orphaned and widowed households who lack labor. In the work, they emphasize following the mass line and oppose coercion. Some cadres have decided to take the lead in the wheat planting work. For example, the village head of Xin Si Village has ten mu of land, planted three mu of wheat last year, and plans to plant seven mu this year, and is willing to lend the remaining seeds to poor farmers.

　　补救水灾损失
　  十三区扩大种麦
    【本报讯】郊十三区为补救水灾损失，计划扩大种麦。该区去年种麦三七、六四四亩，占全部耕地面积的百分之二十三。今年计划种四万八千九百余亩，约占耕地面积的百分之二十八，并争取能更多种。据农民反映，今年雨水多，明年麦收会好，对种麦都有信心。但一部分农民缺乏麦种，又存在着依靠政府救济的思想。该区已召开了区村干部会议，经详细讨论，布置了种麦工作，并由有关各部门组成了区生产委员会，统一领导。全区麦种，自己能解决的有三七三、五八一斤；须调换的有二三四、五三○斤，尚需七六、二三○斤无法解决。在区村干部会上，决定发动农民在自愿原则下进行借贷，互相调剂。并将各村所存公粮换成种子借给贫苦农民。如再不足时请求银行借贷。人民银行已贷给该区麦种三万五千斤，肥料五万斤，调换麦种五万斤。现贷种已由区讨论研究，有重点的贷与受灾较重的东坝、七棵树等五行政村。五万斤肥料及调换的种子，正在了解情况，准备分配。在劳动力与畜力方面，发动在自愿两利原则下，组织互助变工并调剂畜力。全区有牲口三○五一头，如调剂适当，使有牲口户不吃亏，秋耕问题，可以解决。同时并号召人人劳动，发动妇女互助，并注意保证无劳力的烈军干属和贫苦孤寡户的秋收与种麦。在工作中，强调走群众路线，反对强迫命令。若干干部在种麦工作中决起带头作用。如辛四村村长有十亩地，去年种麦三亩，今年准备种七亩，并且愿把剩余种子借给贫农户。
