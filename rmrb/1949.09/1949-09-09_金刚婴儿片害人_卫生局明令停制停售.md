　　King Kong Baby Pills are Harmful
  　Health Bureau Orders Cease of Production and Sales
    [This Municipality News] The Municipal People's Government Health Bureau has recently decided to ban the King Kong Baby Pills produced and sold by Tianxinghao in this city. The company has been notified to immediately cease production and to announce on the radio for three days, notifying all locations and distributors to stop sales. Over the past few months, the Health Bureau has received complaints from various sources. After careful study of the formula of the medicine and actual laboratory tests, it has been confirmed that the prescription of the medicine is not scientific and has many disadvantages for patients. In addition to testing the medicine, the Health Bureau also sent a letter to pediatric experts at major hospitals in the city to identify the prescription, and they unanimously believed that: (1) The dosage is insufficient and cannot cure the disease; (2) Because the pill is a proprietary medicine, it can be said to treat all diseases, but cures none. Sometimes, due to overconfidence in its propaganda, children may lose proper treatment, which may increase the severity of the disease; (3) The combination of "aspirin" and "baking soda" is considered a taboo in pharmacology; the addition of santonin to antipyretics truly makes it a hodgepodge; (4) Infants under six months may experience diarrhea after taking the pill... etc. On the other hand, the false and exaggerated publicity of King Kong Baby Pills is well-known to citizens, which is not conducive to patients. The Municipal Health Bureau repeatedly advised the company, but it turned a deaf ear and made false claims that the medicine had been registered and licensed by the Health Bureau. Since May, the Health Bureau has successively received complaints from citizens, and the medical community has also made suggestions, requesting a ban. The company claims that its monthly advertising expenses are 1.7 to 1.8 million, and there are more than 200 sales outlets in Beiping alone. According to Director Zhang of the Health Bureau: The government will protect legitimate and legal pharmaceutical merchants, and will strictly ban improper and illegal operations to safeguard the health of citizens. Currently, there are still pharmaceutical merchants in this city similar to Tianxinghao. Some have accepted the government's advice, while others continue to engage in illegal business regardless of government laws and the interests of the people. The government hopes that they will quickly correct their mistakes and value human life, so as to avoid being sanctioned by the people's law.

　　金刚婴儿片害人
  　卫生局明令停制停售
    【本市讯】本市人民政府卫生局顷决定取缔本市天兴号所制售的金刚婴儿片，已通知该号立即停制，同时令其在电台广播三天，通知各处及代销店一律停售。数月来，卫生局曾接到各方面的控告，经慎重研究该成药的药方及实际化验的结果，已确认该成药处方不合学理，对患者坏处很多。卫生局除化验了该成药外，并曾函请本市各大医院小儿科专家鉴定处方，一致认为：（一）分剂不足，不能治病；（二）因该药片为一种成药，可以说有病皆治，百病不治，有时因过信其宣传，儿童会失去适当的治疗，致使病势有加重的危险；（三）“阿斯皮林”与“重曹”配合一块，在药物学理上都称为禁忌；又山道年配合在退烧药内，真正成了杂货铺；（四）半岁以下乳儿因服该药片有致腹泻的作用……等等。另方面金刚婴儿片虚伪夸大的宣传，恐市民无人不知，遗误患者不浅。市卫生局曾再三予以劝告，但该号充耳不闻，并招摇撞骗，谎言该成药已经卫生局登记许可。自五月起卫生局即陆续收到市民的控告信，医药界也都纷纷提出意见，要求予以取缔。该号自称每月广告费即有一百七八十万，推销处仅北平一地即有二百多处。据卫生局张局长谈：政府对正当合法经营的药商，必善加保护，而对不正当的非法的经营定严加取缔，以维护市民健康。目前在本市还有类似天兴号的药商，有的接受了政府的劝告，也有的还不顾政府法令与人民利益，而继续作非法营业。政府希望他们迅速纠正错误，以民命为重，免招致人民法律的制裁。
