(Ping Shi News) To correctly implement the policy of benefiting both labor and capital and achieve the goal of restoring and developing production, the Labor Bureau of the Municipal People's Government has specially stipulated the procedures for handling labor disputes in private enterprises. When labor disputes occur in private enterprises, the labor and capital parties should first resolve them through consultation. If they cannot be resolved, representatives from the industry's trade union and trade association may be sent to resolve them through consultation. After the consultation is successful, the representatives of both parties must sign an agreement and file it with the Municipal Labor Bureau for record. If the consultation fails, either party may fill out an application form stating the cause of the dispute, the consultation process, and the crux of the problem, and submit it to the Labor Bureau for mediation. During mediation, both parties involved must be present in person. If they cannot be present due to special circumstances, they may, with the permission of the Labor Bureau, entrust a fully authorized representative to attend. After the mediation is successful, the Labor Bureau will prepare a mediation agreement, issuing a copy to each party for retention and keeping a copy on file with the Labor Bureau. If the Labor Bureau's mediation still fails, the bureau will submit the case to arbitration. During the process of consultation, mediation, and arbitration, both parties should maintain the status quo of production. The capital side must not take actions such as closing the factory, stopping wages, stopping meals, or other reductions in treatment; the labor side must not engage in strikes or other actions that hinder production and violate labor discipline. After receiving the Labor Bureau's arbitration award, if either party is still dissatisfied, they may declare their dissatisfaction to the bureau within five days, and the bureau will submit the entire case to the court for trial. Before the court's judgment, the parties should follow the arbitration decision and handle the matter accordingly. The Labor Bureau will soon issue a notice regarding the above handling procedures for implementation.

　　处理私营企业劳资争议平劳动局规定处理步骤
    【平市讯】本市人民政府劳动局，为正确执行劳资两利政策，达到恢复与发展生产的目的，特规定私营企业劳资争议的处理步骤。凡私营企业内发生劳资争议，首先由该企业劳资双方自行协商解决；如不能解决时，得由该行业的工会及同业公会派代表协商解决，协商成立之后，须由双方代表签订协定，并向市劳动局备案。如协商不成立，任何一方可填写申请书说明争议原因、协商经过、问题症结，提请劳动局进行调解。在调解时须由双方当事人亲自到场，如因特殊情形不能到场时，经由劳动局准许，可委托全权代表出席。在调解成立后，由劳动局制成调解成立书，分别发给双方一份收执，并以一份存劳动局备案。如劳动局调解仍不成立，即由该局提交仲裁。在协商、调解、仲裁过程中，双方均应维持生产原状，资方不得有停厂、停资、停伙及其他减低待遇的处置；劳方不得有怠工或其他妨碍生产及违犯劳动纪律的举动。在劳资双方接到劳动局仲裁书后，任何一方仍不服时，得于五日内向该局声明不服，再由该局将全案提交法院审理。在法院未判决前，当事人应依照仲裁决定，先行处理。上项处理步骤，劳动局即将通告施行。
