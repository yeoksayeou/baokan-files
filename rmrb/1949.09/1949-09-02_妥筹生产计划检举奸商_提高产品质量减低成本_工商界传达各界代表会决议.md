　　[This article reports on the dissemination of resolutions from the All-Circles Representatives Conference to the industrial and commercial sectors of the city.]

　　[This City News] Representatives from the industrial and commercial sectors of this city who attended the Beiping City All-Circles Representatives Conference held a meeting yesterday (1st) with directors and supervisors of various trade associations to convey the resolutions and spirit of the All-Circles Representatives Conference. A total of over 230 people attended. Representative Liu Yifeng emphasized the achievements of the conference and the future direction of efforts for the industrial and commercial sectors. He said: This conference united people from all strata and fully demonstrated the spirit of cooperation. At the same time, the conference created and utilized new democratic forms and methods. Representatives enthusiastically discussed the government's measures and reports. Mayor Ye Jianying and Deputy Mayor Zhang Youyu listened sincerely and accepted the representatives' suggestions and criticisms with an open mind. This conference was full of the spirit and style of people's democracy, sweeping away the bad habits of the past bourgeois pseudo-democracy. Regarding the direction of efforts for the industrial and commercial sectors, he said that first, production plans should be carefully planned, quality should be improved, and costs should be reduced. Production should be based on market needs for specifications and quantities, shaking off dependence on imperialist raw materials, overcoming difficulties, and becoming self-reliant. Speculation must be strictly prohibited. On the one hand, strengthen the organizational structure of the industrial and commercial sectors and actively expose speculators; on the other hand, strengthen the political and professional studies of industrial and commercial practitioners. At the same time, idle capital should be guided into production, and the erroneous idea of simply relying on government loans should be broken. In addition, issues such as adjusting labor-management relations, taxation, streamlining and economizing, eliminating remaining counter-revolutionary special agents and bandits, and dispersing the population were also explained one by one. Various industry associations will convey the information based on the "Outline for Conveying" and "Documents of the All-Circles Representatives Conference" of the Beiping All-Circles Representatives Conference, and mobilize all members to publicize and discuss it within a week. Subsequently, Fu Huating, Zhang Xianting, Zhang Jihuan, and others spoke one after another, calling on all industries to earnestly implement the resolutions of the All-Circles Representatives Conference.
