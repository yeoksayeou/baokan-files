　　【Hebei News】In order to actively develop cooperative undertakings and strengthen leadership over cooperative undertakings, the Hebei Provincial People's Government formally established the Cooperative Affairs Committee on the 11th of this month. The committee members are Guo Xianrui, Wang Jinshan (Director and Deputy Director of Hebei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative), Dai Jinong (Director of the Provincial Department of Commerce), Liu Zehua (Director of the Industrial Department), Jiang Zhanchun (Deputy Director of the Agricultural Department), Fan Ruoyi (Director of the Finance Department), Liu Xiushi (Deputy Manager of the Hebei Branch of the People's Bank), Shao Qinghua (Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Hebei Provincial Women's Federation), and Hou Che (Hebei Provincial Federation of Trade Unions). Guo Xianrui and Wang Jinshan serve as the Chairman and Vice-Chairman respectively. The first meeting was held recently, determining the tasks of the Cooperative Affairs Committee (hereinafter referred to as the "Committee") to be: studying and implementing cooperative principles and policies, reviewing and approving the business plans of the Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative (the business plans of supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels must be reviewed by the corresponding level Committee and approved by the superior cooperative), resolving the relationships between the Supply and Marketing Cooperative and all parties, and handling major issues in the work. Supply and Marketing Cooperatives at all levels are the business organizations that implement the resolutions of the corresponding level Committee.

　　The Committee also studied and approved the work plan of the Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative for the second half of the year.

　　In order to promote the development of cooperative undertakings throughout the province, it was resolved to establish Committees at the county level and above, with members consisting of the main responsible cadres of the Supply and Marketing Cooperative, the Industry and Commerce Section, the Agriculture Section, the Bank, the state-owned stores stationed locally (if there are too many departments, one major one can be selected to participate), and the Women's Federation. The director of the Supply and Marketing Cooperative will serve as the chairman. If the organizations of the Supply and Marketing Cooperatives at the special district level and the province-directly administered cities are unified (such as Baoding and Shijiazhuang), the Committees should also be unified, mainly to solve the problem of urban-rural exchange, but the focus of work should be on the rural areas. The Committees in the province's directly administered cities, regardless of whether they are merged with the special districts, must have responsible cadres from the trade unions participating as members.

　　Finally, various working systems were established, and specific issues regarding leadership were studied. It is expected that the cooperative undertakings throughout the province will achieve new development due to the establishment of Committees at all levels.

　　【Another News】Under the leadership of the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government, the former Jidong, Jizhong, and Jinan District Supply and Marketing Cooperatives were merged to form the Hebei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative. The general guidelines for the work in the second half of the year were determined as follows: to fully carry out the production movement in the autumn and winter seasons, combine with the development of supply and marketing cooperatives, and organize and lead the masses in disaster areas to overcome famine through production. Strengthen the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, increase people's income, and solve the difficulties in the production and life of the masses. The specific measures are as follows:

　　1. Vigorously lead the masses to carry out the production movement and organize the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas.

　　Lead farmers in disaster areas to plant wheat on a large scale. It is estimated that about 22.56 million mu of wheat may be planted in the province this year. Therefore, the solution of the wheat seed problem is a major issue. In addition to mobilizing the masses to borrow from each other, according to the decision of the North China People's Government, 15 million jin of wheat seeds will be transferred and specifically allocated according to the actual situation in various places. Supply and marketing cooperatives in various places must ensure timely transfer and supply to farmers through three methods: loans, sales, and exchanges. The loan procedures should be simple and easy to implement, with short-term and long-term types, with interest rates of 1% to 1.5%, and a slight distinction should be made between members and non-members.

　　According to the different conditions in different regions, resume and develop the production of sideline handicrafts that are marketable in a planned and led manner, and organize small producers to gradually move towards collectivization. It is necessary to be good at organizing the wealth of the masses to solve the difficulty of insufficient funds. In order to strengthen planned operation, it is determined to take the special district as the operating unit, and specific operating figures and sales markets are specifically stipulated. In general, disaster areas mainly develop native cloth, pockets, straw hat braids, and various marketable and skilled productions. In non-disaster areas, in addition to marketable sideline handicrafts, no effort is generally made to engage in them in order to concentrate forces. Water towns mainly develop the fish and mat industries. Mountain areas organize the masses to mine mica, asbestos, medicinal materials, dig gold, and collect and transport waste wood from the mountains and forests. Supply and marketing cooperatives in disaster areas must do everything possible to promote the sale of sideline handicrafts, supply raw materials, improve quality, and reduce costs. Grasp the principle of small profits and quick turnover to enable the masses to obtain profits.

　　Purchase and promote cotton and other agricultural products in large quantities. This year, the province planted 99,266,80 mu of cotton. Excluding the disaster areas, it is estimated that 720 million jin of cotton can be produced. In order to protect the interests of cotton-growing farmers and expand cotton fields, the task of collecting cotton should be raised to a political task. In addition, it is also necessary to plan to purchase peanuts, and in conjunction with state-owned trading organizations, conduct trial operations of pig bristles with emphasis, and plan to collect and transport mountain goods and saltpeter. Organize the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas in a planned manner. This year's disaster situation is relatively serious, and it is estimated that fuel and food will be even more scarce this winter and next spring. Various localities should organize civil manpower and animal power to vigorously develop the transportation industry, protect livestock, try to run transportation cooperatives, and strengthen the material plans between cities and villages, disaster areas and non-disaster areas.

　　2. Actively develop cooperatives in a planned and focused manner

　　According to the situation in the province, the focus of cooperative work should be placed in the vast rural areas, and at the same time, the organization of supply and marketing cooperatives should be the main focus, and other cooperatives should be driven through the supply and marketing cooperatives. Various localities should develop and promote extensively and in large quantities in a planned manner and according to the specific situation. For the development of key cooperatives in the second half of the year, the number of demonstration counties should be expanded to five to seven, and the number of key non-demonstration counties should be developed to three in a planned and focused manner. The whole province requires the number of members to reach 1.5 million to 2 million. In cities, the main task is to organize consumer cooperatives, and it is required that consumer cooperatives in factories, institutions, schools, and troops should be established. Civilian consumer cooperatives will not be established for the time being, and those that have been established will maintain the status quo. Temporary small-scale production cooperatives can be organized in the development of sideline businesses. Small-scale labor-capital combination cooperatives are still allowed to develop because they are currently beneficial to economic development, but the principle of labor-based profit sharing must be implemented. Credit cooperatives can be tried to adjust rural finance and absorb the idle funds and surplus wealth of the masses.

　　3. Establish and improve the organizational leadership at all levels

　　Due to the heavy task of cooperation, supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels must be unified under the leadership of the corresponding level Committee. Therefore, the establishment and improvement of the Cooperative Affairs Committees at the provincial, special district, and county levels must be accelerated. The provincial head office has a special district head office under it. The special district office and the county office are operating units, but their business plans must be approved by the higher-level office. The special district head office has a direct leadership relationship with the county office, helping the county office to operate special economic crops and long-distance transportation and procurement. In order to connect the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, cooperative freight yards are set up in important towns, which are led by the corresponding level offices.

　　推动全省合作事业
  　河北成立合作委会
    确定省供销社秋冬工作计划　全力组织生产领导灾民渡荒
    【河北讯】为积极开展合作事业，加强合作事业的领导，河北省人民政府于本月十一日正式成立合作事业委员会。以郭献瑞、王金山（河北省供销总社正副主任）、戴冀农（省府商业厅长）、刘泽华（工业厅长）、姜占春（农业厅副厅长）、范若一（财政厅长）、刘秀实（人民银行河北省分行副经理）、邵清华（河北省妇联会筹委会主任）、侯澈（河北省总工会）九人为委员；并以郭献瑞、王金山为正副主任委员。日前举行首次会议，确定合作事业委员会（下简称合委会）任务为研究贯彻合作方针与政策，审查批准省供销总社的业务计划（各级供销社的业务计划，均须经同级合委会审查，经上级社批准），解决供销社与各方面的关系，和工作中的重大问题。各级供销社是执行同级合委会决议的业务机构。
    合委会又研究与通过了省供销总社下半年的工作计划。
    为推动全省合作事业的开展，决议县以上成立合委会，委员由供销社、工商科、农业科、银行、驻在当地的国营商店（如部门太多，可择一主要的参加）与妇联会，各部门的主要负责干部组成；由供销社主任任主任委员。供销社的组织，如专区级与省直属市的组织统一时（如保定、石家庄），合委会也统一起来，主要解决城乡交换问题，但工作重点要面向农村。省各直属市的合委会，不论与专区是否合并，都要有工会的负责干部参加为委员。
    最后确立了各种工作制度，并研究了关于领导上的具体问题。预计今后全省的合作事业，将因各级合委会的建立而得到新的开展。
    【又讯】在省委与省政府的领导下，原冀东、冀中、冀南三区供销总社合并，成立了河北省供销总社。确定下半年工作，总的方针为：全力开展秋冬两季的生产运动，结合发展供销社，组织领导灾区群众生产渡荒。加强城乡物资交流，增加人民收入，解决群众生产、生活上的困难。具体措施如下：
    一、大力领导群众开展生产运动，组织城乡物资交流
    领导灾区农民大量种麦。估计今年全省可能种麦二千二百五十六万亩左右。因此，麦种的解决是很大问题，除发动群众互借外，根据华北人民政府的决定，调运麦种一千五百万斤，根据各地实际情况，作了具体分配。各地供销社要保证及时调运，通过贷、卖、换三种方式供给农民。贷时手续要简单易行，分长短期两种，利息一分至一分五厘，社员与非社员要稍有区别。
    根据不同地区的不同条件，有计划有领导的恢复与发展有销路的副业手工业生产，组织小生产者逐渐走向集体化。要善于组织群众的财富，以解决资金不足的困难。为了加强计划经营，确定以专区为经营单位，并具体规定经营数字及销售市场。一般灾区主要发展土布、口袋、草帽辫及各种有销路有技术的生产。非灾区除有销路的副业手工业外，一般的不下力量去搞，以便力量集中使用。水乡主要发展鱼业、席业。山地组织群众采云母、石绵、药材和挖金及拾运山林废木。灾区供销社必须想尽一切办法推销副业手工业产品，供给原料，提高质量，降低成本。掌握薄利广销的原则，使群众获得利润。
    大量收购与推销棉花及其他农产品。今年全省种棉九九二六六八零亩，除灾区估计可产棉七亿二千万斤。为保障种棉农民的利益，扩大棉田，应将收棉任务提高到政治任务上去看。此外，并应计划收购花生，及与国营贸易机关结合有重点的试办经营猪鬃，有计划的收运山货与皮硝。有计划的组织城乡物资交流。今年灾情较重，估计今冬明春燃料、食粮更为缺乏。各地要组织民间人畜力大力开展运输业，保护牲口，试办运输合作社，加强城市与乡村，灾区与非灾区的物资计划。
    二、有计划有重点的积极发展合作社
    根据全省情况，合作社的工作重点应放在广大农村，同时又应以组织供销社为主，通过供销社带动其他合作社。各地应根据具体情况，有计划的，普遍的大量发展与提倡。下半年重点社的发展，已作示范县份，要扩大到五至七个，重点未示范的县份，要有计划有重点的发展到三个。全省要求社员达到一百五十万至二百万。城市中主要是组织消费社，要求将工厂、机关、学校、部队的消费社都建立起来，市民消费社暂不建立，已建立者维持现状。在发展副业中可组织临时的小型生产合作社。对劳资结合的小型合作社，在现时对发展经济尚有利，故仍允许其发展，但必须贯彻以劳力分红为主。为调剂农村金融，吸收群众的游资余财，可试办信用合作社。
    三、建立与健全各级的组织领导
    由于合作任务的繁重，各级供销社必须统一在同级合委会领导下，因此，迅速建立与健全省、专、县合作事业委员会。省总社下设专区总社。专区社县社为经营单位，但其业务计划必须经上级社批准。专区总社对县社是直接领导关系；帮助县社经营特种经济作物，与远地运销、采购。为沟通城乡物资交流，在重要城镇设合作货栈，受同级社的领导。
