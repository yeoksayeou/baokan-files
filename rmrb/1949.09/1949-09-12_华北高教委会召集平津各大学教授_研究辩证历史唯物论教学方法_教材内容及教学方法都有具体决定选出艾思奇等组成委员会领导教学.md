　　North China Higher Education Committee Convenes Professors from Universities in Beijing and Tianjin to Study Teaching Methods of Dialectical and Historical Materialism
    Concrete Decisions Made on Teaching Material Content and Methods; Ai Siqi and Others Selected to Form Committee to Lead Teaching
    [Our Newspaper] The North China Higher Education Committee held a symposium on Dialectical Materialism and Historical Materialism, one of the required public courses in North China universities, on the 10th. More than 40 professors and lecturers teaching this course from universities in Beijing and Tianjin attended. Qian Junrui, Deputy Director of the Higher Education Committee, presided over the meeting. Ai Siqi spoke in detail about his experience in teaching this subject. Teachers at the meeting enthusiastically discussed and unanimously agreed that the teaching objective of Dialectical Materialism and Historical Materialism is to enable students to initially comprehend and begin to establish the proletarian stand, viewpoint, and method through teaching, with particular emphasis on cultivating the labor viewpoint, the mass viewpoint, the class struggle viewpoint, the method of analyzing and handling contradictions, and the method and style of seeking truth from facts, investigation, and research. Secondly, the issue of teaching materials was discussed, and it was decided to use Stalin's "Dialectical and Historical Materialism" as the basic teaching material, and to read Chairman Mao's "Reform Our Study," "Rectify the Style of Study, the Style of the Party, and the Style of Writing," Stalin's "Anarchism or Socialism," and the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Investigation and Research" and other documents and books. Regarding teaching methods, Peking University, Tsinghua University, Yanjing University and other schools have proposed more detailed methods, which generally involve teachers giving introductory reports, followed by group discussions, raising questions, and then giving answer reports, in order to achieve the purpose of carrying out ideological education and solving ideological problems. The meeting also decided that teachers from various schools should hold a symposium every two weeks, and on the spot approved the formation of a "Dialectical Materialism and Historical Materialism Teaching Committee" composed of Ai Siqi, Zheng Xin, Fei Xiaotong, Zhang Dainian, Zhao Chengxin, Shen Zhiyuan, Hou Wailu, Xu Bao＠, Chen Xinren, Chang Renxia, Yue Han, Yang Bingru, Liang Hanbing, etc., directly under the Higher Education Committee, to lead and assist the teaching of this required course in various schools. Each school will separately establish a branch, jointly composed of teachers and students elected personnel, to specifically lead the teaching in each school. Many professors at the meeting emphasized that we should earnestly achieve mutual assistance between teachers and students and "teaching each other," Professor Zhao Chengxin of Yanjing University pointed out that ideological education should be combined with realistic and vivid reading materials. He especially introduced the education he received from the "People's Daily" after the liberation of Beiping, and hoped that in future teaching, it would be combined with current affairs education.
