　　The Seventh Anti-Epidemic Health Station Please Answer:
　　Why Force Us to Write False Certificates?
　　Editor:
　　At about 10:00 AM on August 24th, two injection personnel from the Seventh Anti-Epidemic Health Station came to our school. They rudely asked where the teachers were. We asked them to come to the office, but without any explanation, they wanted to gather the students for injections. After we explained that all teachers and students had already been vaccinated against typhoid and cholera three times in May, they admitted that there was no need for further injections. We were asked if we had received injection certificates. We said that the local health center didn't issue them during the injections. They said they could provide us with injection certificates for convenience and asked us to count out two hundred and sixty-one certificates (the total number of teachers, students, and staff).
　　At the same time, they wanted us to write them a certificate like this: "This is to certify that personnel from the Seventh Anti-Epidemic Health Station have come to this school to administer cholera injections to ××× male students, ××× female students, totaling ××× students. This is to certify, to the Seventh Anti-Epidemic Health Station." We felt that writing this would be inconsistent with the facts and gently explained to them why we shouldn't write it that way. One of them, however, became stern and demanded that we immediately gather the students for injections. We believed that they had no proof of being authorized to inject at our school (although they pointed to their armbands as proof, we didn't think that was sufficient to prove they could inject at will). Furthermore, they knew that our school had already completed the injections and didn't need any more. They only wanted us to gather the students for forced injections because we refused to issue a false certificate that was inconsistent with the facts. This completely violated the proper attitude of staff members, so we sternly refused. We agreed that we could issue the following certificate: "It is verified that all teachers and students of this school completed three combined typhoid and cholera vaccinations by the Changxindian Health Center in mid-to-late May. Personnel from the Seventh Anti-Epidemic Health Station have come to this school to administer injections. After verifying the previous situation (which this school is responsible for), two hundred and sixty-one injection certificates are issued. This is to certify." After looking at it, they said it was acceptable, but they also wanted us to issue another certificate as they instructed above and take it back with them. We stated that we absolutely could not issue a certificate that was inconsistent with the facts. One of them indicated it was acceptable, while the other said it was not. They then used the reason that "further investigation is needed" and took back the injection certificates and left. Based on the above facts, we raise the following questions to the Seventh Anti-Epidemic Health Station:
　　1. Should it be investigated whether personnel were sent to this school on the morning of August 24th? Who were they? What mission were they charged with?
　　2. Why did they issue us injection certificates and want us to issue a false certificate?
　　3. Why did they immediately threaten to gather the students for injections after we gently explained our reasons for not issuing a false certificate?
　　4. Why did they insist that we issue another false certificate even after we had already issued a factual certificate, and even stated that it must be submitted together to be valid?
　　5. Why did they give us the injection certificates initially after we stated that we had already completed the injections? But after we refused to issue a false certificate, why did they take them back under the reason that "further investigation is needed"? What was the reason for this?
　　Based on the above points, we suspect that these two individuals intentionally made false reports about the consumption of vaccines, and it is also necessary to review their bureaucratic work style.
　　Several teachers at this school can testify to the above facts. Please investigate and respond!

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
　　Respectfully,
　　Second Central National Elementary School, Eighteenth District, Beiping Municipality
　　To Mr. Jian Fuhui:
　　Regarding the management of prepared medicines and druggists, we will implement the measures conscientiously once they are announced.
　　To Mr. Yu Xincheng:
　　1. After a nursing mother becomes pregnant, the milk changes to colostrum (i.e., immature milk), which can easily cause diarrhea in children.
　　2. An eight-month-old child can be given fresh milk or formula instead of breast milk if healthy. At the same time, they can also eat porridge, paste, rice cereal, and eggs. These foods should be added one at a time, and attention should be paid to the child's digestion. If the child is unhealthy or has gastrointestinal problems, it is best to seek guidance from a pediatrician regarding which foods to use.
　　3. Diarrhea is naturally one of the causes of being weak and thin.
　　4. It takes a considerable amount of time to recover health after an illness.
　　5. Post-illness care for children still requires guidance from a pediatrician. If the illness is cured, paying attention to nutrition is better than taking medicine in order to restore health.
　　6. Hospitals have regulations regarding the nutritional quality and timing for hospitalized children.

### 第七防疫卫生站请答复　为何强让写假证明

　　第七防疫卫生站请答复
  　为何强让写假证明编辑同志：
    八月二十四日上午十时许，第七防疫卫生站派来注射人员二人，进门后就以毫不和气的态度询问教员在那里；我们让他到办公室来，他们不做任何交待就要集合学生注射。经我们说明了全体师生都在五月间注射了三次伤寒霍乱疫苗以后，他们承认没有再注射的必要。问我们是否领得了注射证，我们说本区卫生院注射时没有发给，他们说为了便利我们可以给我们注射证，遂叫我们自己数了二六一张（师生工友总数二六一人）。
    同时要我们写给他们这样的证明：“兹有第七防疫卫生站来员与本校注射霍乱针，男生×××名，女生×××名，共计×××名，特此证明，此致第七防疫卫生站”。我们认为这样写与事实不合，婉转的向他们说明了不应该这样写的理由，他们其中的一位却板起面孔要我们立刻集合学生，实施注射。我们认为他们并没有受命到本校注射的证明（虽然他们曾经指着臂章就当证明，但是我们不认为那就足以证明他们可以随便注射）。并且他们了解本校已经注射完了，不需要再注射，只是因为我们不答应开具与事实不合的虚伪证明，就又要我们集合学生强制注射。这完全违反了工作人员应有的态度，所以我们严正的拒绝了。我们答应他们，可以开具以下的证明：“查本校师生全体已于五月中下旬由长辛店卫生院注射伤寒霍乱混合疫苗三次完了；兹有第七防疫卫生站来员与本校注射，查明前情（由本校负责），发给注射证二六一张，特此证明。”他看了以后说可以，不过还要我们另外再开一张象他们上面所指示的那样证明，同时拿回去才行。我们表示决不能开具与事实不合的证明。他们之中的一位表示可以，那一位则表示不成。他们遂以“还需要调查”为理由，收回注射证走了。根据以上的事实我们向第七防疫卫生站提出以下几点疑问：
    １、应查明是否八月二十四日上午派员到本校来过？都是谁？他们是负了什么使命来的？
    ２、他们为什么要发给我们注射证，要我们开具伪证明？
    ３、为什么当我们婉转的说明不开具假证明的理由后，马上就以威胁的态度要我们集合学生实施注射？
    ４、为什么在我们已经开具了实实在在的证明以后，还一定要我们另外开具假证明，还声明必需一并呈报上去才有效？
    ５、为什么起初当我们声明了已经注射完了的事实以后，他们就给了我们注射证？但当我们拒绝开具假证明以后却又以“还需要再调查”为理由收回去了？这是为了什么？
    我们根据以上几点怀疑他们两人有意虚报防疫苗的消耗，并且那种官僚主义的作风也有提出检讨的必要。
    以上的事实本校的几个教员都可以证明。请第七防疫卫生站检查并答复！

    简复慧先生：
    关于成药和药商管理，一俟办法公布后，定当切实施行。于鑫城先生：
    一、乳母怀孕后，乳质即已变为初乳性质（即未成熟的乳）小儿食后易于腹泻。
    二、八个月的小孩如果身体健康可用鲜牛乳或代乳粉代替母乳。同时还可以和食粥、面糊、米糊及鸡蛋等。这些食物要一种种的增添，并且还要注意小孩的消化情形。如果身体不健康、或是有肠胃病的时候，应用何种食物，最好请小儿科医师指导。
    三、腹泻自然是瘦弱的原因之一。
    四、病后恢复健康，是需要相当时日的。
    五、小儿病后的调养，仍需要小儿科医师的指导。如果疾病痊愈，谨是恢复健康，还是注意营养，比较服药为佳。
    六、医院对于住院病儿的营养质量及时间，均有规定。
