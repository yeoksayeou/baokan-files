Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 29th: The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) plenary session today unanimously approved the Presidium's report on the review of representatives' proposals. The original text of the report is as follows:

　　A total of fourteen proposals were received from the representatives. The Representatives' Proposal Review Committee first reviewed them and submitted their review opinions, which were discussed and resolved by the Standing Committee of the Presidium. Except for the fourth case, which has already been resolved and will not be discussed, each case should be handled separately as follows:

　　Category 1, totaling two cases:

　　Case 1: Guo Moruo, Li Jishen, Shen Junru, Huang Yanpei, Ma Xulun, and 40 others proposed that the congress urgently send a telegram to the United Nations denying the representatives of the Kuomintang reactionary government.

　　Case 2: Huang Qixiang, Zhang Nanxian, He Zhuguo, and 13 others proposed that the First Plenary Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference send a telegram to the United Nations General Assembly, solemnly declaring the denial of the Kuomintang reactionary government.

　　The Representatives' Proposal Review Committee merged the above two cases for review. The Standing Committee of the Presidium believes that the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China elected by the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is the only government that can represent the Chinese people, and the government should issue a statement denying the credentials of all representatives sent by the pseudo-Kuomintang government to attend the United Nations meetings. Therefore, the above two cases should be handed over to the Central People's Government for implementation.

　　Category 2, totaling one case:

　　Case 3: All female representatives proposed that the congress extend regards to the troops in the name of the congress.

　　The Standing Committee of the Presidium agreed with the review opinion of the Representatives' Proposal Review Committee and proposed the following specific methods for extending regards to the troops:

　　(1) In the name of this congress, a telegram will be sent to express regards to the People's Liberation Army and the families of soldiers and martyrs throughout the country. (The telegram will be drafted by the Secretariat and read and adopted at tomorrow's congress.)

　　(2) After the establishment of the Central People's Government, the local governments should be ordered to distribute military shoes, socks, towels, soap, and meat to the troops when celebrating the establishment of the Central People's Government.

　　Category 3, totaling ten cases.

　　The Standing Committee of the Presidium believes that all cases are related to economic construction, the welfare of overseas Chinese, people's education, and national health, and the intentions are very good; the Central People's Government should be requested to forward them to relevant agencies for adoption and implementation.

　　人民政协全体会议通过提案
  　否认伪政府联大代表慰劳全国人民解放军
    交由中央人民政府分别执行
    【新华社北京二十九日电】中国人民政协全体会议，今日一致通过主席团关于代表提案审查的报告，报告原文如下：
    查代表提案，共收到十四件。先由代表提案审查委员会审查，并提出审查意见，经主席团常务委员会讨论决议。除第四案业已解决，不予讨论外，各案应做如下分别的处理：
    第一类，计两案：
    第一案：郭沫若、李济深、沈钧儒、黄炎培、马叙伦等四十四人提请以大会名义急电联合国否认国民党反动政府代表案。
    第二案：黄琪翔、张难先、何＠时等十六人提请以中国人民政治协商会议第一届全体会议名义电告联合国大会，郑重声明否认国民党反动政府案。
    以上二案，经代表提案审查委员会合并审查。主席团常务委员会认为中国人民政治协商会议所选举的中华人民共和国中央人民政府为唯一能代表中国人民之政府，应由政府发出声明，否认伪国民党政府所派出席联合国会议所有代表的代表资格。因此以上两案应交中央人民政府执行。
    第二类，计一案：
    第三案：全体女代表提请以大会名义劳军案。
    主席团常委会同意代表提案审查委员会的审查意见，提出劳军具体办法如下：
    （一）以本届大会名义通电慰问全国人民解放军及军属烈属。（电文由秘书处起草，明日大会宣读通过。）
    （二）中央人民政府成立后，应即通令各地政府于庆祝中央人民政府成立时，分发军鞋、袜子、毛巾、肥皂和肉食劳军。
    第三类，计十案。
    主席团常务委员会认为各案均系有关经济建设、侨民福利、人民教育暨国民卫生等事项，用意甚善；应请中央人民政府转交有关机关采择施行。
