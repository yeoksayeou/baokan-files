Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 8th: According to TASS, Budapest: The discussion on the report of the leadership of the World Federation of Democratic Youth at the Second World Youth Congress is nearing completion. Speakers unanimously endorsed the WFDY's activities in defending peace and exposing the crimes of warmongers, as well as its activities in fighting for democracy, freedom, national independence, and a bright future. Participants in the Congress supported the suggestions of the Soviet delegation.

　　In the morning session of September 6th, after the representative of Puerto Rico spoke, the American youth representative, Moore, said: The American democratic youth completely support the policies of the World Federation of Democratic Youth. They are increasingly determined to participate in the struggle against Wall Street's aggressive plans. On Moore's suggestion, the Congress unanimously passed a resolution to send a cable to US President Truman, protesting the US government's policy of plunder.

　　The succeeding speaker, Lim, the youth representative of Malaya, reported on the living conditions of the Malayan people groaning under British bondage. He said: However, we belong to the camp of democratic youth worldwide, and we are fighting not only for our national independence, but also against the entire colonial system, and for global peace.

　　Youth representatives from Turkey, Italy, Algeria, the Netherlands, Cameroon (Africa), and Australia also spoke at the morning session.

　　In the afternoon session, the South African youth representative, Yarward, said: The 8.5 million people of color in South Africa are deprived of all rights. They live in poverty. Eighty-five percent of the residents are illiterate. Social diseases such as syphilis, gonorrhea, and tuberculosis are rampant. South African youth are now rising up to fight against imperialist oppression, to strive for freedom and independence, and to fight for world peace.

　　The Ukrainian representative, Semichastny, said: The young men and women of Soviet Ukraine are very concerned about the fate of young people all over the world.

　　The French representative, Fekir, pointed out: French youth are becoming more and more experienced in the struggle against the reactionary government, and they have gained experience. Fekir told the Vietnamese representatives: The democratic youth of France will spare no effort to help the Vietnamese people fight for freedom and independence. He said: If the French government dares to launch a war against the great Soviet Union, then we will do everything in our power to stop it.

　　Next, Pastor Jensen, representing American youth, appeared on the podium. He said that fascism is the enemy of all mankind, and it still exists under the rule of barbaric capitalism. Dying American capitalism is increasingly emitting the odor of fascism. The life-and-death struggle against fascism is the responsibility of every Christian. Christians must unite with all democratic forces. Believers express deep respect for the genuine democracy that exists in socialist Soviet Union and its great contribution to the anti-fascist struggle.

　　The Vietnamese youth representative first extended a fighting salute to the representatives on behalf of the Vietnamese guerrillas fighting for freedom and independence. He described the terrible situation created by the French imperialists in Vietnam. He said that in 1945, two million people in Vietnam starved to death. More and more people are uniting around the democratic government led by Ho Chi Minh. We will become an independent country, we want peace and we will fight for peace.

　　The Danish representative, Carlson, emphasized that we will never take up arms to attack the Soviet Union, which liberated us from the shackles of fascism. We will fight for peace shoulder to shoulder with the Soviet youth.

　　Belgium's Ivardry continued: The reactionary government of Belgium receives subsidies from American imperialism and attempts to turn the Belgian people into docile tools of warmongers. But our people will never follow this policy.
