Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 27th: TASS, New York - Vyshinsky's speech at the United Nations General Assembly on the 23rd, and the proposals of the Soviet government that he presented, have become the center of attention for American newspapers. Most newspapers published reports on these proposals on the front page. Radio commentators also reported the gist of the Soviet proposals. The Soviet condemnation of the US and British ruling groups for preparing for a new war, opposition to the establishment of aggressive military blocs, and demands for the prohibition of atomic weapons and the establishment of strict and effective international control over atomic energy have become known to the American people and have been met with sympathetic reactions. The Soviet proposal called on the United Nations to urge the US, Britain, China, France, and the Soviet Union to jointly make efforts to achieve this goal and conclude a five-power pact to strengthen peace, in implementing the will of all countries around the world to avoid the danger of a new war and ensure peace. The great spiritual power of this Soviet proposal has shattered all the propaganda tricks of the reactionary newspapers.

The New York Herald Tribune and the New York Times reported the gist of Vyshinsky's speech in detail, and the New York Times also published the full text of Vyshinsky's speech. The newspaper pointed out that the Soviet proposal called on all countries to resolve their disputes without resorting to threats or use of force. Even the unprogressive newspapers pointed out that the Soviet proposal, aimed at consolidating peace and cooperation among countries, is proof that the Soviet Union has consistently had a peace plan. The Baltimore Sun wrote that United Nations officials pointed out that Vyshinsky's speech did not deviate from the plan that he and Molotov before him had explained at previous UN General Assembly meetings.

The Compass wrote that Vyshinsky condemned the United States and Britain for preparing for war and proposed to the United Nations that the United States, the Soviet Union, France, Britain, and China conclude a pact to strengthen peace. Vyshinsky told the General Assembly: Further delays in establishing appropriate and strict international control over atomic energy cannot be allowed. The newspaper pointed out that United Nations political observers believe that Vyshinsky's proposal of a five-power pact directly confronts the United States and Britain with the issue of peace. The heads of the US and British delegations have so far remained silent to foreign journalists regarding their attitude towards the Soviet proposals. The New York Times pointed out that Acheson and Bevin both refused to comment on the Soviet proposals, although they apparently discussed the Soviet proposals during a long meeting in the UN lounge. The US and British delegations did not come forward to publicly oppose the Soviet proposals, which have received widespread support from countries around the world, but instigated newspapers to publish news saying that the US and British delegations would try to obstruct the passage of the Soviet proposals.

The New York Times wrote on the 24th that the delegations of the United States, Britain, France, and China would not agree with the Soviet proposal on major powers concluding a pact to strengthen peace.

However, all attempts to diminish the great power of the Soviet proposals have been met with obvious failure. Vyshinsky's speech and his proposals are the main topics of discussion among delegates and the public attending the United Nations General Assembly. The Soviet Union's bold and heroic struggle for peace has received a good response and enthusiastic support from countries around the world. The hatred of the US and British warmongers for the Soviet proposals only makes the power of these proposals even greater.

### 苏向联大和平建议获得世界人民拥护　美英战贩不安反动宣传破产

　　苏向联大和平建议获得世界人民拥护
  　美英战贩不安反动宣传破产
    【新华社北京二十七日电】塔斯社纽约讯：苏联代表团团长维辛斯基二十三日在联合国大会的演说以及他所提出的苏联政府的建议，成为美国报纸的注意中心。大多数报纸均在第一版刊载关于这些建议的报道。无线电评论员也报道苏联建议的要旨。苏联谴责美英统治集团进行新战争准备的建议，反对建立侵略性军事集团与要求禁止原子武器以及建立对原子能之严格和有效国际管制的建议，已为美国人民所知悉，并受到同情的反应。苏联建议要求联大于执行全世界各国避免新战争危险与确保和平的意志时，敦促美英中法苏共同进行实现这一目的的努力，并缔结加强和平的五国公约。苏联这个建议的伟大的精神力量，已粉碎了反动报纸的一切宣传伎俩。
    纽约先驱论坛报及纽约时报详尽报道维辛斯基演说的要旨，纽约时报并刊载维辛斯基演说的全文。该报指出，苏联建议呼吁一切国家解决它们的纠纷，而不要采取以武力相威胁，或使用武力的办法。甚至连不进步的报纸也指出，旨在巩固各国和平与合作的苏联建议，是苏联一贯拥有和平计划的证明。巴尔的摩太阳报写道，联合国人士指出，维辛斯基的演说没有离开他和在他以前的莫洛托夫在历次联大会议上说明过的计划。
    指南针日报写道，维辛斯基谴责英美准备战争，并向联合同建议由美苏法英中五国缔结公约以加强和平。维辛斯基告诉联大：在建立原子能的适当与严格的国际管制上的再事延迟，是不能允许的。该报指出，联合同政治观察家认为，维辛斯基提出了五国公约的建议，就把和平问题直逼到美英头上。美英代表团团长对外国记者，关于他们对苏联建议采何态度的询问，迄今保持沉默。纽约时报指出，艾奇逊与贝文均拒绝对苏联建议发表任何意见，虽然他们显然曾在联大休息室的长时会谈中讨论过苏联的建议。美英代表团未出面公开反对得到世界各国广泛支持的苏联建议，但唆使报纸刊载消息，说美英代表团将试图阻挠苏联建议的通过。
    纽约时报在二十四日写道，美英法中四国代表团，将不赞同苏联关于大国缔结加强和平公约的建议。
    但是，一切缩小苏联建议之巨大力量的企图，均遭到显明的失败。维辛斯基的演说与他提出的建议，是出席联合国大会的代表与公众的主要谈论题目。苏联为和平而进行果敢与英勇的斗争，已得到良好反应和世界各国的热烈拥护。美英战争贩子对苏联建议的憎恨，仅仅使这些建议的力量更加增大。
