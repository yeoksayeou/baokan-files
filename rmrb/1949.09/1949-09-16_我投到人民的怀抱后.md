　　After I Threw Myself into the Embrace of the People
    Liu Debiao
    I participated in the labor of building the People's Square outside Tiananmen, and I felt unspeakably happy. Under the leadership and education of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, hundreds and thousands of young people, holding high the bright red flag, demonstrated the vigorous posture of the youth of New China. There, the gongs and drums were deafening, the Yangko dance, and the loud singing, stirred up the enthusiasm for labor. That kind of excited feeling of putting a pole on your shoulder and running back and forth as if nothing had happened, and the happy scene of labor, has not disappeared in my heart until now.
    Participating in this labor gave me another practical lesson. I thought of the youth in the old society, under the education of the reactionaries, not only could not labor for the people; on the contrary, they were opposing the people, oppressing the people, and exploiting the people. I was one of the youths who was deceived by the reactionaries into the Youth Training Corps, and then tricked into the Political Work Team, and sent to the 58th Division to be a probationary platoon leader, and became a tool against the people.
    On April 26, 1947, this anti-people army went from Suxian County to the area of western Anhui and eastern Henan; it was said to be "suppressing bandits." In more than two months, the "suppression" caused the common people to run away, and not even a chicken or a dog was seen. They cut down trees, removed door panels, and dismantled furniture to make fortifications. They dug pits and holes everywhere in the houses, and dug ditches and ridges in the fields, cutting the crops to feed the horses. I remember one time when we arrived at a village, there was only one family left. Our company commander, a Sichuanese with a beard, wanted the family to move out so that he could build machine gun fortifications in the house. The old man and the woman holding a nursing baby knelt down in front of him, kowtowing and begging: "Official Elder Master, please have mercy, we only have these two houses. Take whatever you need, just leave us a place to stay..." Before she could finish speaking, the bearded man curled his lips and kicked the old man to the ground! He also scolded fiercely: "Damn you, if we don't make fortifications, you'll leave a good house for the Eighth Route Army to live in! If you don't get out of here, I'll kill you!" The poor woman's face was pale with fright, and she helped the old man up, and had to leave with the furniture. After walking a few steps, she kept looking back, sobbing. …
    Later, it was said that we were going north to "suppress bandits." I thought: Those who kill, burn, loot, and commit all kinds of evil are bandits. Aren't these bandits in front of us? Where else are we going to suppress them? But in the end, I was dragged into the fire pit of the civil war in Yangshanji, western Shandong. Fortunately, the People's Liberation Army led by the Communist Party rescued me from this fire pit; I was nurtured and grew into a revolutionary newborn in the embrace of the Communist Party, and now I am more than two years old.
    I am now actively studying, to learn more knowledge and skills, to better serve the people, and to contribute to the construction of Peiping, the construction of North China, and the construction of New China.
    These are all the education that the Communist Party has given me. She is my loving mother, she teaches me to be a good person, to do good things for everyone. Therefore, I feel her greatness even more, and I want to follow her forever.
    In contrast, what did the reactionaries teach me? Burning, killing, looting, doing everything possible to destroy, becoming bandits, being robbers, trampling on my own fathers, brothers, wives and children. The more I think about it, the more angry I get. I want to study hard, work hard, and use our strength to develop and build the places destroyed by the reactionaries and the barren land.

　　我投到人民的怀抱后
    刘德标
    我参加建筑天安门外人民广场的劳动，心里有说不出来的高兴。在共产党毛主席领导、教育下的成百成千的青年们，高举着鲜红的旗帜，表现出新中国青年个个朝气勃勃的姿态。在那里，锣鼓喧天，秧歌舞，宏亮的歌唱，鼓动了劳动的热情。那一种将杠子放在肩头上象没事的一样来回奔跑的兴奋的心情和劳动时的愉快的情景，在我的心中，直到现在还没有消失。
    这次参加劳动，在我又上了一个实际的课。我想到旧社会的青年，在反动派的教育下，不惟不能为人民劳动；相反地，却在反对人民，压迫人民，剥削人民。我便是一个被反动派骗入青年集训队，后又被哄到政工队，分送五八师去当见习连指的青年，而变成了反人民的工具
    一九四七年四月二十六日，这支反人民的军队从宿县到皖西豫东一带；说是“清剿”，两个多月的时光，“剿”得老百姓都跑了，鸡狗都不见一只，砍树、卸门板、拆家具来做什么工事，房子里到处挖坑掏洞，地里就挑沟起堑，将庄稼割来喂马。记得有一次到的那个村，就剩一家人家了，我们那个四川胡子的连长，还要那家人都搬走，好在屋里做机枪工事。那家老头和抱着吃奶孩子的妇人，一齐跪在他的面前，一面叩头，一面哀求：“官长老爷，你老人家行行好吧，俺就这两口屋。东西你用什么就拿什么，给俺们留个＠①处……”话未完，那胡子一翘，上去就是一脚，把老头踢倒在那里！并厉言厉色的骂道：“你妈的，不叫做工事，留好房子给八路住！再不给我滚开，老子要你的命！”可怜那妇人脸都吓得苍白了，扶起老人，只得带着家具离走。走了几步，还不住回头看看。哽咽的哭着。……
    后来说是北上“剿匪”，我想：杀、烧、抢、掠、无恶不作的才是匪，眼前这些不都是匪吗，还上那儿去剿呢？但是我终于被挟上鲁西羊山集内战的火坑，幸被共产党领导的人民解放军把我从这个火坑里救了出来；就在共产党的怀抱里辅育成长成革命的初生儿，现在已两周岁多了。
    我现在正积极的学习着，要学习更多的知识和技术，更好的去为人民服务，为建设北平、建设华北、建设新中国出一份力量。
    这些都是共产党给我的教育。她是我慈爱的母亲，她教我做好人，给大家做好事情。因此我越发感到她的伟大，我要永远的跟着她。
    反过来，反动派教育我的是什么？烧、杀、抢掠，到处尽破坏的能事，做土匪，当强盗，蹂躏自己的父兄妻子，我越想越气愤，我要努力的学习，努力的劳动，把反动派破坏的地方，荒芜的土地，用我们的力量去开发它，去建设它。
