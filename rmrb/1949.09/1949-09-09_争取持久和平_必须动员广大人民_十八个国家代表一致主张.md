    Striving for Lasting Peace
  　We Must Mobilize the Broad Masses of the People
    Unanimous Advocacy by Representatives of Eighteen Countries
    Representatives of eighteen American countries pointed out in their speeches that lasting peace cannot be achieved through passive pacifism. This peace must be achieved through an active struggle for peace, coupled with continued exposure of the warmongers' masks and the mobilization of the broad masses of the people to defend peace.
    The Chilean representative denounced the activities of the country's president, Videla. He emphasized that the struggle against this US-backed Videla regime is an indispensable part of the struggle for lasting peace.
    Canadian representative Wen Youzhang called for mass action against atomic bomb production, using atomic energy solely for peaceful purposes. He said that the struggle for peace will be carried out in every city and every village in Canada. He also condemned the US authorities for refusing to grant transit visas to the Canadian delegation attending the Mexico conference, forcing the Canadian delegation to take a detour. Finally, he mentioned the economic and political pressure exerted by the United States on Canada, the purpose of which is to make the latter completely obedient to the interests of the United States and its aggressive anti-Soviet policy.
    The Guatemalan representative stressed in his speech that "the power of the dollar" is pushing towards war, but humanity's struggle against the dollar is growing day by day.
    The conference read out many congratulatory telegrams, including those from Professor Timofeevsky and Boris, organizers of the Wroclaw Congress of Intellectuals, as well as from the Polish Women's League, the Czech Writers' Union and other organizations.
    Although the governments of the United States, Brazil and other countries have obstructed representatives from attending the Mexico conference, those attending the conference include well-known figures from various American countries, such as Chilean poet Neruda, Argentine lawyer Garcia, Argentine Women's Federation President Daiponsai, Brazilian journalist Pena, Brazilian lawyer Mogal, Venezuelan "International Daily" editor Silva, and Colombian figure Florella.
    The conference may last five days. The conference has appointed ten committees.

    争取持久和平
  　必须动员广大人民
    十八个国家代表一致主张
    十八个美洲国家的代表们在他们的演说中指出：持久的和平是不能以消极的和平主义获致的。必须以积极的和平斗争，并配合以继续揭穿战争贩子的假面具，和动员广大人民保卫和平，来获致这一和平。
    智利代表指责该国总统魏德拉的活动。他强调说：反对这个受美国支持的魏德拉政权的斗争，就是争取持久和平的斗争中的不可缺少的一部分。
    加拿大代表文幼章号召以群众性的行动反对原子弹生产，把原子能单独用在和平目的方面。他说：和平的斗争将在加拿大的每一个城市、每一个乡村中进行。他并谴责美国当局曾拒绝给予出席墨西哥大会的加拿大代表团以过境签证，这样就使加拿大代表团不得不绕道而行。最后他述及美国对加拿大所施的经济和政治压力，其目的在使后者完全听从美国的利益及其侵略的反苏政策。
    危地马拉的代表在演说中强调说：“美元的力量”正在推向战争，但人类反对美元的斗争则与日俱增。
