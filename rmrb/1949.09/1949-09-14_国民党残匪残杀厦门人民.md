Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 13th: Kuomintang remnant bandit gangs are once again wantonly arresting and killing people in Xiamen. According to Hong Kong and Xiamen news in Shanghai's Ta Kung Pao and Wen Hui Bao, since the end of August, bandit "Southeast Military and Political Deputy Chief" Tang Enbo, bandit Xiamen Garrison Commander and special agent head Mao Sen, etc., have been directing military police and secret agents to arrest and kill people. As of the 3rd, more than a hundred progressive people from all walks of life have been murdered. On the night of the 31st alone, as many as sixty professors, students, workers, reporters, and shop assistants were arrested. Among them, more than forty people who were deemed slightly "suspicious" by the bandit gang were killed that night, and another twenty or so were押往 (escorted to) Magong Island. In the following days, there were continued mass shootings and mass burials alive. All universities and middle schools in Xiamen have been occupied by bandit troops, and a group of students staying at Xiamen University have been concentrated on Gulangyu for "supervision." Bandit Tang has also ordered bandit special agent officers and soldiers to enter private residences at any time to carry out "surprise inspections," causing the citizens to be unable to eat or sleep in peace. Bandit "Southeast Military and Political Chief" Chen Cheng arrived in Xiamen from Taiwan on the 11th, and publicly announced that he would continue to carry out cruel suppression of the people of Xiamen.
