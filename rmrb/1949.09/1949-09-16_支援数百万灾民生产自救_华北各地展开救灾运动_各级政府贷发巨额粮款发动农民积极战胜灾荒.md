　　Supporting Millions of Disaster Victims in Self-Salvation Through Production
　　Disaster Relief Campaigns Unfold Across North China
    Governments at All Levels Issue Huge Loans of Grain and Funds, Mobilizing Peasants to Actively Overcome the Disaster
    [This newspaper reports] This year, due to the impact of various disasters in the North China region, agricultural production has been greatly reduced in some areas, resulting in a large number of disaster victims. In response to the actual disaster situation, governments at all levels have launched disaster relief work. For example, Hebei and Chahar provinces have launched a thrift and disaster preparedness production self-salvation movement, while Tianjin has a disaster relief donation movement. Recently, the North China Bureau, the North China People's Government, and various units of the North China Military Region have also launched a "one-ounce rice movement," and the entire region is being swept up in a disaster relief high tide.

    Since the beginning of spring, the entire region has generally experienced drought, including the former Jinnan, Taihang, Taiyuan, southern Hebei, most of Chahar Province, and parts of Suiyuan. Under the leadership of governments at all levels, the broad masses were mobilized to fight the drought, carrying out drought-resistant planting, and finally completing this year's sowing task. Except for Pingyuan Province and some mountainous areas, the drought did not cause major damage. As the seedlings gradually grew, insect pests followed closely, with more than forty types of pests affecting an area of 222 counties and more than 5 million mu of cultivated land, accounting for about 2% of the total cultivated land area. However, under the emergency mobilization and organization of the broad masses by party and government departments at all levels, the pests were quickly extinguished. Apart from some severely affected areas, this year's pest control results were significant. In addition, the entire region also experienced disasters such as frost, hail, wind, and cattle plague, and destroyed seedlings were generally replanted.

    However, since the beginning of the hot season, continuous surges in various rivers have caused significant flooding. The total flooded area in North China is 29,462,200 mu, with 283 breaches and overflows of various rivers (52 major embankments), of which 69 have been blocked. In Hebei Province, there were 272 breaches, flooding more than 8,930,000 mu of land; in the former Hebei-Shandong-Henan region, there were 11 breaches; in Chahar Province, river flooding inundated 83,000 mu of land; and the Yellow River flooded 90,000 mu of beach land. In total, the area affected by river overflows and breaches was more than 9,100,000 mu, mountain floods destroyed 148,500 mu, and the rest were caused by rainwater, totaling 19,399,900 mu, accounting for two-thirds of the total disaster-stricken area in the region. There are 90 counties affected in the region, including 79 in Hebei, 11 in Chahar, and 169 villages in Shanxi. The final statistics for the affected population are not yet available, but it is estimated to be over 8 million, with 3.5 million being the most severely affected. In some disaster-stricken areas, the water receded quickly, such as along the upper reaches of the Zhulong River, which was not only harmless to crops but also beneficial. In some areas, wheat fields were left to silt, equivalent to silt irrigation, such as the Guzhuang section of the Jiyun River. However, a large portion of crops were completely submerged. Apart from tall-stalk crops with 30% yields, cotton and millet were completely destroyed. Eastern Hebei is the most severely flood-stricken area in Hebei, with the 12th Special District alone having a disaster area of more than 4 million mu, including 13 counties and more than 2,100 villages, with 310,000 houses collapsed and 200,000 households and 1,420,000 people affected. In addition, fishing and salt-producing households suffered greatly due to typhoons and tsunamis, and many crops were destroyed by the wind. Some disaster victims previously had side occupations such as weaving mats, weaving cloth, and spinning thread. Now, efforts should continue to open up sales channels in various ways, and the government is vigorously helping farmers restore side occupations and open up markets.

    The causes of this year's flooding are mainly due to the excessive river flows, making prevention and control difficult. In general, maximum efforts were made in flood prevention work. Many commissioners and county heads braved the rain to inspect the dikes at night, and personally participated in dike protection work or went into the water to plug breaches. Generally speaking, this year's attention to flood prevention exceeded any previous year, and there were many model deeds of the broad masses heroically rescuing and fighting selflessly. However, bureaucratic negligence in prevention still exists in individual areas.

    The North China People's Government has made great efforts to provide relief and treatment for the various disasters this year, issuing agricultural loans to solve difficulties in seeds, farm tools, and fertilizers, and actively cooperating with the people in various places to open canals, control rivers, provide loans, dig wells, and repair waterwheels. The total amount of agricultural loans in the first half of this year reached 582 million yuan. Many people said with emotion: "Heaven creates disasters, and the government provides relief." Now, governments at all levels have lent out a large number of wheat seeds to help farmers in disaster areas sow wheat in the autumn. The North China Government allocated 2 million jin of emergency relief wheat seeds to Hebei Province; Hebei Province lent out 15 million jin of wheat; the Water Conservancy Committee is also carrying out necessary river blocking in eastern and central Hebei, and the first batch of materials and labor costs of 5 million jin of millet has been approved by the North China People's Government for allocation. Immigration measures are also being discussed. In addition, the masses are being actively organized to drain water from waterlogged areas and promptly replant wheat; the masses are being mobilized to organize sideline production; grain, coal, and other necessities are being transported in a planned manner, and emergency relief is being handled in a focused manner.

　　支援数百万灾民生产自救
　  华北各地展开救灾运动
    各级政府贷发巨额粮款发动农民积极战胜灾荒
    【本报讯】华北地区今年由于各种灾害的侵袭，使部分地区农业生产减收很大，造成了大批灾民，各级政府针对灾情实况，纷纷展开救灾工作，如河北、察哈尔两省已发动了节约备荒生产自救运动，天津市则有救灾捐款运动，近日来华北局、华北人民政府和华北军区各单位亦发起“一两米运动”，全区正卷入救灾高潮。
    入春以来全区普遍发生旱灾，计有原冀南、太行、太原、冀中南部、察哈尔省大部及绥远部分地区。在各级政府的领导下，发动广大群众与旱灾作斗争，进行抗旱点种，终于完成了今年的播种任务。除平原省和部分山地外，旱灾并未造成重大损害。当青苗渐次成长时，紧接着又发生了虫灾，害虫达四十余种，被灾面积达二百二十二县，被害耕地五百余万亩，约占总耕地面积的百分之二，但在各级党、政部门的紧急动员组织广大群众捕打下，也很快地扑灭了。除部分严重地区有损失外，今年灭虫成绩是很大的。此外全区并曾先后发生冻、雹、风和牛瘟等灾害，被毁青苗一般都补种上了。
    但入伏以来，由于各河不断猛涨，造成了很大的水灾，全华北水灾面积共为二千九百四十六万二千亩，各河漫溢溃决共二百八十三处（主要堤防五十二处），已堵六十九处。河北省决口二七二道，淹地八百九十三万余亩；原冀鲁豫区决口十一道；察哈尔省河水泛滥淹地八万三千亩；黄河淹没滩地九万亩。总计河水漫决受灾面积为九百一十万余亩，山洪冲毁十四万八千五百亩，其余皆为雨水成灾，计有一千九百三十九万九千九百亩，占全区被灾总面积的三分之二。全区受灾者有九十县，其中河北占七十九县，察哈尔十一县，此外山西尚有一百六十九个村。被灾人口尚无最后统计，估计约在八百万人以上，最严重的有三百五十万人。被灾地区有的水过即干，如潴龙河上游沿岸，对农作物不但无害，而且有利；有的是留麦地，等于放淤灌溉，如蓟运河沽庄段即是。但有一大部分庄稼完全被淹，除高杆作物有三成收成外，棉花、谷子完全被冲毁。冀东是河北水灾最严重地区，只第十二专区被灾面积即达四百万亩以上，包括十三个县二千一百余村，房屋倒塌三十一万余间，被灾二十万户一百四十二万人。此外由于台风、海啸的袭击，渔户、盐户受害甚大，农作物被刮坏很多。一部灾民以前曾有副业，如编席、织布、纺线等，现在应继续多方面地打开销路，政府正大力帮助农民恢复副业并开辟市场。
    造成今年水灾的原因，主要是由于各河水势过大，难以防治；在防汛工作上，一般地都尽了最大努力。不少专员、县长冒雨上堤，黑夜检查，并亲自参加护堤工作，或下水抢堵决口。今年一般说来，对于防汛的重视，是超过了过去任何一年的，广大群众英勇抢救，奋不顾身的模范事迹很多。但是官僚主义疏于防范的错误在个别地区仍然存在。
    华北人民政府对于今年历次的灾害均曾大力予以救治，发放农业贷款，解决种籽、农具、肥料等困难，并与各地人民配合积极开渠治河，贷款，打井，修理水车，今年上半年的农贷总数即达五亿八千二百万元。不少群众感慨地说：老天爷造灾，政府救灾。现在各级政府为帮助灾区农民秋季种麦，又贷出了大批麦种，有华北政府拨交冀省的急赈麦种二百万斤；冀省麦贷一千五百万斤；水利委员会亦在冀东、冀中进行必要河流的堵口，第一批工料费五百万斤小米已呈准华北人民政府拨下，移民措施亦正研讨中。此外对积水地区，积极组织群众进行排水泄水，及时抢种小麦；发动群众组织副业生产；有计划地输送粮煤及其他生活必需品，有重点地办理急赈都在进行中。
