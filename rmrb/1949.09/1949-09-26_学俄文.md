　　Learning Russian
    Xiao Nan
    More than 90 percent of the teachers, students, and staff of the entire Beijing Normal University have joined the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, and 53 percent of the members have joined extracurricular Russian language classes. However, some people say, "When the Japanese devils came, we learned Japanese; when the Americans came, we learned English. Finally, no one is forcing us to learn a foreign language, but we are automatically learning Russian!" There is quite a sigh in these words.
    Yes, this question is not strange, because the Chinese people have suffered more than a hundred years of bullying from foreign imperialism, so mentioning foreigners fills them with anger. However, how to distinguish the Soviet Union from imperialist countries can be clearly seen from the phrase "automatically learning Russian."
    Culture itself is a tool, and the class that masters it serves that class. What did the Japanese imperialists mean by forcing us to learn Japanese? The reason is simple: to train slaves who can speak the language of the devils. Why did the American imperialists want us to learn English? Of course, there was profit to be made, to facilitate the buying off of "democratic individualists" of the "American way of life" to serve them. However, this does not mean that Japanese and English should absolutely not be learned. The main thing is to see from what standpoint and viewpoint you learn. If it is from the standpoint and viewpoint of the masses of the people, what is wrong with learning the enemy's things as weapons for your own struggle?
    Our automatic learning of Russian today is even more essentially different, because we understand the laws of social development. The whole world must take the road of the Soviet Union, and in history, the Soviet Union has already used the blood of the working people fighting against the exploiting classes to write a classic that instructs the working people of the world to seek a bright future, and a deep Sino-Soviet friendship. This friendship has been expressed even more concretely recently. When 200 million Soviet people and 400 million Chinese people join hands, what imperialist dare to be mischievous! Moreover, because the Chinese people have learned from the Soviet Union's revolutionary experience and achieved victory, of course, they must further learn from the Soviet Union's construction experience to build their beloved motherland, turn the backward agricultural China into an advanced industrial country, create the prerequisites for a socialist country, and then transition to the highest ideal of mankind, a communist society. With such lofty ideals, why not automatically "learn Russian"? Whoever can help us progress, we will learn from them. The Soviet Union is leading us on the right path, and of course we must learn from the Soviet Union, and we must learn thoroughly, starting with the Russian alphabet.

　　学俄文
    萧南
    北师全校师生工友百分之九十以上参加了中苏友好协会，会员的百分之五十三参加了课外的俄文学习班，但也有少数人这样说：“鬼子来了学日语，老美来了学英文，好容易没人强迫着学洋文了，又自动的学起俄文来了！”言下颇为慨叹。
    是的，这个问题并不奇怪，因为中国人民受了一百多年的外国帝国主义的气了，所以一提外国人就愤怒填膺，但是，如何把苏联和帝国主义国家区别开来，从“自动学习俄文”这句话上就看得清楚了。
    文化本身是一种工具，那个阶级掌握了它就给那个阶级服务，日本帝国主义者强迫我们学日语是什么意思呢？理由很简单，是要训练会说鬼话的亡国奴；美国帝国主义者希望我们学英文是为什么呢？当然有利可图，为了便于收买“美国生活方式”的“民主个人主义者”给他服务呀。然而，这并不是说日语和英文绝对不应该学习了，主要要看以什么立场观点去学，如果是人民大众的立场观点，学习了敌人的东西作为自己战斗的武器，有什么不可以学呢？
    我们今天自动的学习俄文，更有本质上的不同，因为我们懂得了社会发展的规律，全世界都要走苏联的路，而且在历史上苏联已经用劳动人民向剥削阶级斗争的血，写下了一部指示全世界劳动人民谋取光明大道的经典和一笔深厚的中苏友谊，这友谊在最近已经更具体的表现出来了，两万万苏联人民和四万万中国人民携起手来，那个帝国主义者敢调皮捣蛋！并且由于中国人民学习了苏联的革命经验而取得了胜利，当然要进一步的学习苏联的建设经验，来建设自己所热爱着的祖国，使落后的农业中国变成先进的工业国家，造成社会主义国家的先决条件，再过渡到人类最高理想的共产主义的社会中去。有了这样高尚的理想，为什么不自动的“学俄文”呢？谁能帮助我们进步，我们就学习谁，苏联领导着我们走上了正路，我们当然要学习苏联，而且要彻底的学习，从俄文字母学起。
