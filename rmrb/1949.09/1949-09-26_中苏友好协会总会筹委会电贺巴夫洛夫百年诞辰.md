The Preparatory Committee of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Sends Congratulatory Telegram for Pavlov's Centenary
    The Preparatory Committee of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association sent a telegram to the Soviet Union's Pavlov Centenary Commemoration, expressing congratulations. The telegram reads: "On the occasion of the centenary of the birth of the great biologist Academician Pavlov, we extend our sincere congratulations. Academician Pavlov was a great innovator in science, and his classic works in the study of nervous system activity particularly mark the great victory of materialism over idealism. He is the pride of the Soviet people and the pride of all the people of the world. In the struggle of the Chinese and Soviet people, shoulder to shoulder, against imperialist aggression, for lasting peace, and for people's democracy, Academician Pavlov's great scientific achievements will give the Chinese people great encouragement."
