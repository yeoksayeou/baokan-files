　　Tianjin People Conquer the Flood
　　Water Levels of All Rivers Generally Fall; State of Emergency Lifted
    [Tianjin News] Since the beginning of autumn, the water levels of various rivers in Tianjin have generally fallen. By the White Dew on the 8th, all had fallen below the warning line. Among them, the Hai River was 0.06 meters lower than the warning water level, the South Canal was 0.24 meters lower, and the North Canal was 0.74 meters lower. At this point, the two-month-long struggle against the flood has come to an end, and the summer flood season has been successfully overcome. The Municipal Flood Control Committee specially notified the flood control headquarters of various districts on the 9th, announcing the lifting of the state of emergency for all rivers. All remaining materials in various districts and temporarily requisitioned unused materials should be returned to the Flood Control Committee and the original owners immediately. If there are any unpaid requisitions, payment should be made immediately. The Flood Control Committee also scheduled responsible comrades to go to various districts on the 12th to re-inspect the projects to determine the gradual restoration of various facilities before the emergency. All blocked works and water pumps at the ditch entrances, except for special circumstances where they must be retained, will be demolished after re-inspection. Currently, all departments are actively rushing to complete the summary matters, and it is expected that it will be officially concluded in a week.
