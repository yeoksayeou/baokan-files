Tibetan Compatriots, Prepare to Welcome Victorious Liberation!
　　Tian Bao (Sangji Yexi)
　　Just as China's revolutionary war is advancing towards the northwest and southwest borders, and the great cause of people's liberation is about to achieve complete victory throughout the country, the so-called "anti-communist incident" of July 8th suddenly occurred in Tibet. This was a conspiracy engineered by the Anglo-American imperialists and their running dog Nehru. Its purpose is not only to attempt to prevent our Tibetan people from obtaining the liberation they have long yearned for, but also to further transform our Tibetan national defense territory of over 1.2 million square kilometers into a colony of foreign aggressors. We feel extremely indignant about this aggressive conspiracy of the Anglo-American imperialists and their running dog Nehru, and express our firm opposition.
　　For over a hundred years, our Tibetan people have suffered greatly from the aggression of Anglo-American imperialism. The harm we have suffered has been extremely profound! The British imperialists first occupied Sikkim, our Tibetan outer vassal, in 1816, and then launched two wars of aggression against Tibet in 1887 and 1904. During the invasion of Tibet, the British troops raped, plundered, and committed all kinds of atrocities. The people were massacred, and many temples were destroyed. Even the official British newspaper, the London Daily Mail, had to admit in its news chronicles: "British soldiers transported their looted goods (referring to the looted goods from Tibet) to India in an endless stream." It also said, "The living rooms of British residences are now filled with Tibetan antiques and treasures." The cruelty of their looting can be imagined. We Chinese people will never forget this blood debt and have the right to demand that the British imperialists fully repay it. From that time until now, British imperialism has never ceased its aggression against Tibet. Since the end of World War II, American imperialism has become even more actively plotting to invade Tibet. It has sent spies to Tibet to carry out conspiracies, and conducted aerial reconnaissance, photography, and surveying. In 1947, it even sent a so-called "goodwill mission" to Tibet to create puppets and gain actual control over Tibet. The aggressive actions of the British, American, and Indian aggressors have taught our Tibetan monks and laypeople, making us increasingly aware that the Anglo-American imperialists and their running dog Nehru are the deadly enemies of our Tibetan people. If we Tibetan people want to avoid the fate of colonial slaves and seek freedom and development for our nation, we must, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, unite closely and firmly with the Han and other fraternal ethnic groups in the country, and resolutely oppose any conspiracy to split national unity. Not only our Tibetan people, but any minority ethnic group within China, cannot be separated from the Han people today. Otherwise, they will inevitably become colonial slaves of imperialism. We Tibetan people are unwilling to be colonial slaves. We want to be the masters of an independent, free, democratic, and unified New China. We will carry forward the heroic tradition of our nation's two resistances against British imperialism and resolutely oppose the aggressive conspiracies of the Anglo-American imperialists and their running dogs.
　　Tibet is an inalienable part of China's territory. This is a matter of course. Our Tibetan people have joined the great family of Chinese nationalities for a long time. Even any British or American official news agency whose profession is to fabricate rumors cannot present any evidence to the contrary. The friendship between our Tibetan people and the Han people and other ethnic groups in the country has been damaged by British, American, and Indian aggressors and Han and Tibetan reactionaries. However, now that the remnant forces of the Kuomintang reactionaries are about to be completely eliminated, and a new state of people's democratic dictatorship led by the Communist Party is about to be born, we firmly believe that this unity between fraternal ethnic groups will inevitably be strengthened unprecedentedly under the policy of ethnic equality of the Chinese Communist Party and New China. The autonomy of our Tibetan people and the construction in political, economic, and cultural aspects will inevitably be developed rapidly with the active support of the Chinese Communist Party and the new state. The example of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region fills us with unlimited confidence in the bright future of Tibetan development in the great family of New China. All facts prove that the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army are the saviors of all ethnic minorities in China. If our Tibetan people want to achieve liberation and development, it is absolutely impossible without the leadership of the Communist Party and the help of the People's Liberation Army. We Tibetan people must wholeheartedly support the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army. Any "anti-communist" conspiracies and tricks are contrary to the interests and will of our Tibetan people and will inevitably be relentlessly attacked by the Tibetan and Chinese people.
　　We warn the British, American, and Indian aggressors to quickly stop all aggressive conspiracies against Tibet. If they dare to provoke us on Tibetan territory, they will surely receive the punishment they deserve in the face of the great power of the Chinese people. At the same time, we call on all Tibetan compatriots to rise up! Resolutely oppose the aggression of Anglo-American imperialism and their running dog Nehru, and prepare to welcome victorious liberation!

　　西藏全体同胞，准备迎接胜利的解放！
    天宝（桑吉悦希）
    正当中国的革命战争推向西北和西南边疆，伟大的人民解放事业快要在全国取得彻底胜利的时候，我西藏地方突然发生七月八日的所谓反共事变，这是英美帝国主义者及其走狗尼赫鲁阴谋制造的。其目的，不仅在于企图阻挡我们西藏人民得到渴望已久的解放，而且企图进一步使我们西藏一百廿余万方公里的国防疆土变为外国侵略者的殖民地。对于英美帝国主义者及其走狗尼赫鲁的这一侵略阴谋，我们感到万分的愤慨，表示坚决的反对。
    一百余年来，我们西藏人民饱受英美帝国主义的侵略，所遭祸害，至为深巨！英帝国主义者在一八一六年首先侵占了我西藏的外藩锡金，并于一八八七年及一九○四年又两度发动侵略我西藏的战争，当时侵入西藏的英国军队，到处奸淫掳掠，无所不用其极，人民横遭屠杀，庙宇多被破坏，连当时的英帝国主义的官方报纸伦敦日报也不得不在新闻纪事中供认：“英兵运其劫掠赃物（按指劫掠我西藏的赃物）至印度者，络绎不绝”。又说“英人住宅客厅中，已满布西藏之古董珍品”。其劫掠之酷，可以相见。这笔血债，我们中国人民永远不能忘记，并有权利要英帝国主义者来完全偿还。从那时候起，一直到现在，英帝国主义始终没有停止其对西藏的侵略活动。美帝国主义自第二次世界大战结束之后，亦更加积极图谋侵略西藏，曾派间谍人员到西藏进行阴谋活动，并进行空中的侦察，照相与测绘，一九四七年更派所谓“亲善访问团”到西藏活动，力图制造若干傀儡，取得对西藏的实际统治权。英、美、印侵略者的侵略事实，教训了我们西藏僧俗人民，使我们日益明确的认识到，英美帝国主义及其走狗尼赫鲁，是我们西藏人民的死敌。我们西藏人民要想避免殖民地奴隶的命运，求得自己民族的自由与发展，必须在中共领导下和汉族及国内其他兄弟民族亲密的、巩固的团结起来，坚决反对任何分裂民族团结的阴谋。不仅我们藏族即中国境内的任何少数民族，今天都不能和汉族人民分裂，否则，必然会沦为帝国主义的殖民地奴隶。我们藏族人民绝不愿做殖民地的奴隶，我们要做独立、自由、民主、统一的新中国的主人，发挥我族两次抗击英帝国主义的英勇传统，坚决反对英美帝国主义者及其走狗的侵略阴谋。
    西藏是中国领土的一部分，这是天经地义，我藏族人民加入中国各民族的大家庭，已有悠久的历史。即任何以造谣为职业的英、美官方通讯社，也不能提出任何一点与此相反的证据。我们藏族与汉族及国内其他各民族的友谊，曾经受过英、美、印侵略者及汉、藏反动派的损害，但是现在，国民党反动派的残余势力即将被彻底消灭，共产党领导的人民民主专政的新国家即将诞生的时候，我们坚信这种兄弟民族间的团结，必然会在中共和新中国的民族平等的政策下得到空前的加强，而我藏族的自治和政治、经济、文化各方面的建设，也必然会在中共和新国家的积极扶助下得到飞跃的发展。内蒙自治区的榜样，使我们对于藏族在新中国大家庭中光明的发展前途，充满了无限的信心。一切事实证明，共产党和人民解放军是我们中国各少数民族的救星，我们藏族人民要想得到解放和发展，没有共产党的领导和人民解放军的帮助是断乎不能成功的。我们藏族人民必须竭诚拥护共产党和人民解放军，任何“反共”的阴谋诡计，是违反我藏族人民的利益和意志的，必然会受到藏族和全国人民的无情打击。
    我们警告英、美、印侵略者，赶快停止对我西藏一切侵略阴谋，如果胆敢在我西藏领土上挑衅，在伟大的中国人民力量面前，一定会受到应得的惩罚。同时我们号召西藏全体同胞，起来！坚决反对英美帝国主义及其走狗尼赫鲁的侵略，准备迎接胜利的解放！
