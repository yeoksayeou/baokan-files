Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 19th: The following statement has been issued by Wang Youyong and 52 other former legislators of the Kuomintang puppet Legislative Yuan:

　　We were all legislators of the Legislative Yuan of the former Nanjing government. When the Kuomintang government retreated from Nanjing and Shanghai, we stayed behind with firm resolve in an extremely complex and terrifying environment. Our reason for staying was that the Kuomintang government's retreat to Guangzhou to continue fighting was fundamentally incompatible with our consistent opposition to being enemies of the people. We could not violate our own principles to support a reactionary regime and adhere to the war of the American imperialists to devastate the people!

　　We know that many of those who retreated with the Kuomintang government, especially among our colleagues, shared our understanding and views, and were forced to leave due to the circumstances at the time. To be honest, in the past, we did not have a deep understanding or sufficient knowledge of the policies of the Chinese Communist Party due to the news blockade and biased propaganda. We only recognized that the Kuomintang had been in power for more than twenty years, and it could not be said that they did not have enough time to serve the country and the people, but not only did they fail to improve the country, but they regressed and became more colonialized; not only did they fail to seek welfare for the people, but the accumulation of various erroneous measures such as corruption, feudalism, and selfishness deepened the suffering of the people and aroused their resentment. We should have broken away from this regime that betrayed the revolution and the people long ago. However, some of us were bound by personal feudal relationships and lacked the courage to break away from the environment that we had long been dissatisfied with; others harbored reformist illusions, thinking that staying there might offer some minor remedy. These attitudes and ideas of ours have more or less contributed to the continuation of the reactionary regime, which is a very serious mistake and fault of ours. The country originally belongs to the people, and Mr. Sun Yat-sen earnestly exhorted his party members to have the spirit of serving the world for the common good. Whether those in power now or in the past should bravely face reality and frankly admit failure; they should not be reluctant to give up their positions, causing suffering to the people. As Mr. Zhang Wenbai said in his statement on June 26th, "Since we are incapable, we should give way to those who are capable; since we have achieved nothing, we should give way to those who have achieved success." This is the breadth of mind that those who are loyal to the country and the people should have. At that time, the principle of our colleagues "not hesitating any personal sacrifice to promote the realization of peace" was based on this pure and simple understanding, admitting our past mistakes, and unanimously deciding.

　　Since the liberation of Nanjing, Hangzhou, and Shanghai, we have gained a further understanding of the Chinese Communist Party and its specific measures in various aspects. The New Democracy advocated by Mr. Mao Zedong, in the current stage of implementation, its essence is in line with Mr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary Three Principles of the People. What the Kuomintang reactionaries, headed by Chiang Kai-shek, have abandoned is precisely what the Chinese Communist Party is seriously implementing today. The major aspirations of national independence, political democracy, economic equality, and people's freedom, which the Kuomintang reactionaries have always used as slogans to deceive the people and seek personal gain, we see that the Chinese Communist Party is striving for these goals with courageous and responsible determination and a pragmatic spirit, and has gradually realized them in many liberated areas. If anyone continues to use fine-sounding terms such as safeguarding independence and freedom as a banner, to oppose the Chinese Communist Party or the People's Liberation Army, it is not only shooting an arrow without a target, but also using falsehood to confuse the truth. Moreover, we believe that only the Chinese Communist Party, with its hardworking and practical style, seeking progress through humble learning, and correcting mistakes through mutual criticism and self-criticism, can truly build a brand-new country. Here, we have seen the rebirth of the Chinese nation, and hundreds of millions of people feel great excitement! Therefore, we should sever all relations with the Kuomintang reactionary government and sincerely accept the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, study diligently, and strive for a new life.

　　The above is our new understanding and ironclad facts, which we have personally experienced, seen, heard, and personally felt, and which are in stark contrast to the various phenomena under the rule of the Kuomintang that we were previously dissatisfied with. We do not believe that a reactionary regime that violates history and is abandoned by the people can continue to linger on! As evidenced by the rapid military advance of the People's Liberation Army in recent months, we can see how generous the twenty-four articles of the eight-article domestic peace agreement are to the reactionary group! However, the reactionary group's response to this magnanimous and nationalistic reply is not to admit their mistakes and submit, and ask the people for forgiveness; but to intensify the blockade of the sea, bomb the people; and to fawn on MacArthur and the American imperialist puppets Quirino and Syngman Rhee,妄想借来寇兵,践踏祖国。They have forgotten that the armed encirclement of fourteen countries thirty years ago has fostered the powerful socialist Soviet Union of today. They have also forgotten that the invasion of Japan's more than one million troops for eight years has fostered the unprecedentedly powerful People's Liberation Army and the democratic forces of the people in China today. Feeling the responsibility to the country and the people in our conscience, we believe that it is necessary to truthfully report to the people outside the liberated areas and the Kuomintang party, government, and military personnel. Especially to our former colleagues in the Legislative Yuan who are now scattered in Guangzhou, Chongqing, Taiwan, Guilin, and other areas awaiting liberation, we must give a sincere piece of advice, hoping that they will believe that our words are sincere, eliminate all doubts, and resolutely join hands with us and move towards the side of the people!

　　Of course, we are not the only colleagues who have remained in the liberated areas, and because our knowledge is not comprehensive enough, we are unable to seek signatures one by one. We hope to be forgiven for any omissions.

### 伪立委五十三人发表声明　虔诚接受中共领导　决心努力学习争取新生

　　伪立委五十三人发表声明
　  虔诚接受中共领导
  　决心努力学习争取新生
    【新华社北平十九日电】前国民党伪立法委员王又庸等五十三人顷发表声明如下：
    我们都是前南京政府立法院立法委员，当国民党政府由京沪撤退的时候，我们在极其复杂和恐怖的环境中，很坚定地留下来了。我们留下来的理由，是认为国民党政府撤退广州继续作战，和我们一向反对与人民为敌的主张根本不相容的。我们不能违反自己的主张去支持一个反动的政权，依附美帝摧残人民的战争！
    我们晓得，随同国民党政府撤退的人们，尤其是我们的同仁中，有许多是和我们的认识相同，主张一致，徒以格于当时的环境不得不走的。说老实话，已往我们对于中共的政策，由于新闻的封锁，和片面宣传的朦蔽，是没有深切的了解与足够的认识的。我们只是认识国民党执政二十多年，对国家人民服务不能说没有足够的时间，然而不但未能把国家搞好，反而更倒退，更殖民地化了；不但未能为人民谋福利，反而由于贪污腐化封建自私种种错误措施累积的结果，更加深了人民的痛苦，招致了人民的怨愤。这种背叛革命，背叛人民的政权，我们早就应该和他脱离关系。但是我们中间，有的是羁于个人的封建关系，没有足够的勇气摆脱自己所久已不满的环境；有的是存着改良主义的幻想，以为留在那里或者可有些微补救，我们的这种态度和想法都或多或少的有助于反动政权的延续，这是我们很严重的错误和过失。国家本来属于人民，孙中山先生并谆勉他的党员要有天下为公的精神，不论现在或过去当政的人，实在应该勇敢地面对现实，坦白地承认失败；不应该再事恋栈，徒苦人民。诚如张文白先生于其六月二十六日声明中所说：“我们自己既然无能，就应该让给有能的；自己既然无成，就应该让给有成的”。这是忠于国家忠于人民的人应有的襟怀。当时我们同仁“不惜任何个人牺牲以促成和平之实现”的主张，就是根据这一种纯洁朴素的认识，承认自己过去的错误而一致决定的。
    自从南京、杭州、上海先后解放以来，我们对于中国共产党及其在各方面的具体措施，都有了更进一步的了解。毛泽东先生所倡导的新民主主义，在实行的现阶段说，其要旨是与孙中山先生的革命的三民主义相符合的。凡中国国民党以蒋介石为首的反动派所背弃了的，正是中国共产党今天所认真执行着的。大家所憧憬的国家独立，政治民主，经济平等，人民自由诸大端，国民党反动派一向拿来欺骗人民借图私便的口号，我们看到中共是在以勇敢负责的决心，实事求是的精神，为这些目标而奋斗，并且在许多解放地区确已逐步实现。如再有人以保障独立自由等好听的名词为号召，以与中国共产党或人民解放军为敌，不但是无的放矢，而且是以伪乱真。并且我们认为只有象中国共产党这种刻苦努力，践履笃实，以虚心学习求进步，以相互批评和自我批评纠正错误的作风：才能真正建设成一个崭新的国家。我们在这里看到了中华民族的新生，亿万人都感到莫大的兴奋！所以我们就应该与国民党反动政府断绝一切关系，而诚心诚意地接受中国共产党的领导，努力学习，争取新生。
    以上是我们亲历其境，亲见亲闻和亲自体验到的新的了解和铁一般的事实，而和我们以前所不满于国民党统治下的种种现象，恰好成为极其强烈的对照。我们不相信一个违反历史而为人民所弃绝的反动政权，还能够苟延残喘！证以最近几个月来解放军军事推进的迅速，我们更可以看出国内和平协定八条二十四款对于反动集团是如何的宽大来！但是反动集团对这种为国为民宽大为怀的答复，不是认过服输，向人民请罪；而是变本加厉地封锁海口，轰炸人民；奴颜婢膝地奔走于麦克阿瑟及美帝傀儡季里诺、李承晚门下，妄想借来寇兵，践踏祖国。他们忘记了三十年前十四国的武装包围，助长了今日世界强大无比的社会主义的苏联。他们也忘记了八个年头日本百多万军队的侵扰，助长了今日中国空前强大的人民解放军和人民民主的力量。我们感于对国家对人民良心上的责任，认为有向解放区以外的人民及国民党党政军人员据实报告的必要。尤其是对前立法院现在散处在广州、重庆、台湾、桂林暨其他待解放区的同仁们，我们必须有一次真挚的忠告，希望他们相信我们的语出至诚，排除一切疑虑，毅然和我们携手走向人民这一方面来！
    留在解放区的同仁，自然不仅我们这些人，因为我们知道的还不够周全，也就无法一一征求签署。挂漏之处，至希原谅。王又庸、王剑锷、方志超、孔令灿、朱华、初香山、李蒸、李峰、李仲公、李世军、李荫五、周伯敏、周杰人、孟云桥、武和轩、吴绍澍、金鸣盛、施今墨、范予遂、洪瑞钊、姜黎川、秦荣甲、孙履平、孙翔风、邹树文、崔纫秋、陈名豫、陈建晨、张汇文、万灿、程元斟、黄梦飞、黄启汉、曹寅甫、傅霖、贾戎章、葛敬恩、葛克信、葛覃、赵华叔、华声慕、欧元怀、薛明剑、郑若谷、郑家俊、刘蓬瀛、刘不同、刘云昭、熊梦宾、卢郁文、戴修骏、罗运炎、萧觉天。
