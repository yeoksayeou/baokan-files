[This Municipality News] The Jin Cheng Coal Shop and De He Long Hemp Shop on Chaoyangmen Outer Street were found to have evaded taxes by falsifying their account books, according to an investigation by the Fifth Sub-bureau of the Tax Bureau. After learning that the Jin Cheng Coal Shop was suspected of tax evasion, the Tax Bureau repeatedly sent cadres to conduct persuasion, but the manager of the shop, Miao Xin'geng, remained stubborn and refused to tell the truth, yielding no results. The Tax Bureau then continued to conduct side investigations and further obtained specific information. On August 13th, they went to the shop again to review the account books and found that the daily coal sales in the business account were only between 200 and 300 jin, with extremely regular figures, and the numbers of stamp tax used were also inconsistent. At the same time, through individual conversations, it was learned that the actual sales of coal balls at the store on August 11th were 1,300 jin, on the 12th were 1,600 jin, and on the 13th were 900 jin, none of which were recorded in the accounts. In addition, a large number of coal jin were also recorded in back accounts, resulting in a large amount of tax evasion. Based on these materials, the Tax Bureau cadres repeatedly persuaded the shop. Manager Miao Xin'geng of the shop initially prevaricated, but then, with the facts present, he admitted the past mistakes of deceiving the government and handed over three hidden genuine account books from a bolt of white cloth. A total of more than 5 million yuan of unreported business turnover was involved, 6,153 yuan of evaded spring business tax, and 6,816.8 yuan of evaded stamp tax. The next day, the Tax Bureau also discovered that De He Long Hemp Shop, a neighbor of Jin Cheng Coal Shop, also had similar instances of making false accounts and evading taxes, so they used the example of Jin Cheng Coal Shop to persuade them. The shop initially did not believe it, but later, with the assistance of Miao Xin'geng, the manager of Jin Cheng Coal Shop, in persuasion, they handed over three genuine account books, admitting that they had concealed more than 800,000 yuan of business turnover and evaded 2,440 yuan in stamp tax. The Municipal Tax Bureau, considering that Jin Cheng Coal Shop had repented and assisted the government in persuading others with actions, decided to deal with the tax evasion leniently.

　　朝外大街两商店
  　造假帐逃税被查获
    【本市讯】朝阳门外大街金城煤栈及德和隆麻铺，伪造帐簿，逃避纳税，经税务第五分局查获。税务局于获悉金城煤栈有逃税嫌疑后，曾一再派遣干部前往进行劝导，该号经理苗心耕态度倔强，拒不吐实，没有结果。税局乃继续进行侧面调查，进一步获得具体情况，于八月十三日再至该号查阅帐簿，发现营业帐每天售煤均在二、三百斤之间，数字极其规律，而印花贴用数字也有不符。同时由个别谈话中，获悉八月十一日门市实售煤球一千三百斤、十二日实售一千六百斤、十三日实售九百斤，全未列帐，另有大批煤斤多笔，也记的后帐，漏税款甚多。根据这些材料，税局干部再三向该号说服，该号经理苗心耕初尚支吾，后以事实俱在，乃承认过去欺骗政府的错误，从一匹白布中将藏匿的真帐三本交出，共计漏报营业流水额五百余万元，漏缴春季营业税六千一百五十三圆，漏贴印花税六千八百十六圆八角。次日，税局又查获金城煤栈邻户德和隆麻铺也有同样制造假帐、偷漏纳税情事，乃以金城煤栈实例进行说服。该店初不置信，后由金城煤栈经理苗心耕协助劝导，始将真帐三本交出，计匿报营业流水额八十余万元，偷漏印花税二千四百四十元，具结承认。市税局对金城煤栈漏税部分，念其已自己悔过，且以行动协助政府说服旁人，决定从宽处理。
