North China Professional Department Store
　Officially Established in Tianjin
　Branch Company Conference to be Held in the Coming Days
[Our Tianjin Dispatch] The North China State-Owned Department Store was officially established in Tianjin on the 12th. In order to further promote the sale of industrial finished products and promote the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, eleven department store branches have also been established in Tianjin, Beiping, Baoding, Taiyuan, Zhangjiakou, Shijiazhuang, Tangshan, Linqing, Handan, Suiyuan, Xinxiang and other places. Ten department store sub-branches have been established in Datong, Bozhen, Qinhuangdao, Xuanhua, Linfen, Changzhi, Anyang, Nangong, Xingtai, and Xinji. The tasks of the state-owned department store are: (1) Under the principle of restoring and developing industrial and agricultural production, the industrial products will be sold in large quantities to small and medium-sized cities and vast rural areas through branch companies, and in cooperation with local trade departments, agricultural products will be purchased in large quantities to supply the needs of industrial production, so as to achieve material exchange and urban-rural mutual assistance. (2) Based on the principle that commercial profits should not be higher than industrial profits, the method of small profits but quick turnover, or even unprofitable sales, is still adopted in terms of price and profit, appropriately reducing the price of goods and commercial profits, and increasing industrial profits, so as to promote the rapid development of industry, transform consumer cities into industrial cities, and overcome the past bad phenomenon of cities exploiting the countryside. It is reported that the company will soon hold a branch company meeting to study specific operating methods and make specific operating plans.
