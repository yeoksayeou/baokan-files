　　Conscientiously Carry Out Cotton Seed Selection
    Xi Fengzhou, Cotton Production Improvement Division, Ministry of Agriculture

    Cotton picking has already begun. In all improved seed promotion areas, efforts should be made to complete the cotton seed selection work. Before proceeding, it is necessary not only to strengthen technical guidance, but also to pay attention to organization and mobilization. (1) Key points of propaganda: (1) Publicize the advantages of Sz-character Cotton No. 2, such as high yield, long cotton fibers, high ginning percentage (high lint content), numerous fruit branches, and labor-saving management. (2) Explain to the masses: Good cotton fetches a high price. This should be linked to the immediate interests of the masses so they recognize that planting more improved cotton leads to greater profits. (3) Explain methods for maintaining improved varieties, so that the masses understand the techniques and do not mix the improved varieties. (4) Explain that the promotion of improved varieties is to increase cotton production and improve cotton quality, increase farmers' income, and relate it to machine spinning. (5) Explain that improved varieties are not easily obtained, so they should be cherished. In addition to increasing production by planting improved varieties themselves, they should also retain more improved seeds so that everyone can plant them. (2) Educate cotton farmers to sell improved cotton as much as possible to public cotton purchasing agencies in order to gin them separately and maintain control of high-quality cotton seeds. (3) Launch competitions in improved seed areas and propose competition conditions, such as ensuring that improved cotton varieties are not mixed, not mixed with frost-damaged cotton, and that the seeds are pure and free of impurities. The leadership should also put forward vivid and powerful slogans, such as: "Don't waste a single improved seed!" (4) In the work of harvesting and preserving purity, promptly summarize and promptly reward model cotton farmers and cadres. (5) Conduct seed inspection work: In the work of harvesting and preserving purity, in order to promptly discover problems and correct shortcomings, mass inspection work should be carried out, with the masses supervising each other, so that cotton farmers submit high-quality cotton seeds as much as possible.

    In order to do a good job in harvesting seeds, it is impossible not to pay attention to technology. Therefore, when guiding the masses in seed selection, from harvesting to storing seeds, strict separation must be maintained: (1) When picking cotton in the field, the improved varieties should be picked separately and put together. (2) After the improved cotton is picked, it should be stored separately at home and not mixed together. (3) The improved cotton seeds that are to be kept for seed should be ginned separately and not mixed with ordinary cotton. (4) The ginned improved seeds should be stored separately and should never be mixed together.

　　认真进行棉花选种
    农业部棉产改进处席凤洲
    棉花已经开始摘收，在各良种推广区，应该用力完成棉花选种工作。在进行以前，不但要加强技术指导，更要注意组织动员工作。（一）宣传要点：（１）宣传斯字棉二号的优点，如产量大，棉丝长，出净花多（衣分高），果枝多，管理省人工。（２）向群众说明：好棉花价钱高，要联系到群众的切身利益，使认识到多种良棉多得利。（３）说明保持良种的方法，使群众懂得技术，不要混杂了良种。（４）说明推广良种，是为了增加棉花产量及改良棉花品质，增加农民收入，并联系到与机器纺纱的关系。（５）说明良种来路不容易，应该珍惜，除自己种了良种增产外，还应多留良种，让大家都能种。（二）教育棉农，使棉农尽量把良种棉花卖给公家收购棉花的机构，以便分别轧花，保持掌握优良棉种。（三）在良种区要发动竞赛，并提出竞赛条件，如保证棉花良种不混杂、不掺霜后花，种子纯净无杂质等。领导上并提出生动有力的口号，如：“不浪费一粒良种！”（四）在收花保纯工作中，及时总结，及时奖励模范棉农及干部。（五）进行籽种检查工作：在收花保纯工作中，为了及时发现问题，纠正缺点，要进行群众性的检查工作，由群众互相监督，使棉农尽量交出优良棉种。
    为了把收种做好，不注意技术是不行的。因此，在指导群众选种时，从收花到存放种子，都要严格分开：（一）在地里摘收棉花时，要把良种分开摘到一起。（二）良种棉花摘起以后，到家里要分别放开，不要混放一块。（三）准备留种的良种棉花，要分开去轧，不要和一段棉花混轧。（四）轧出来的良种，种子要分开保存，千万不要混到一处。
