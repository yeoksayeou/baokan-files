　　We Are Steel
    Jin Shou, a sand casting worker at the Changxindian Machinery Factory, Foundry Workshop
　　Jin Shou
    Hey! Our group is steelmaking!
　　We suffered oppression in the past, such hardship! Such hardship!
　　We could only be passive and idle, loitering in the latrines;
　　Taking a smoke and checking the time, dawdling until it was time to quit work,
　　At the end of the month, the salary was quite a bit, a big wad of cash for each person!?
　　Buying noodles at the grain store was not enough, enough for the cat to eat in one meal!
　　Parents, wives, and children, worried and hungry.
　　Now we are liberated, the whole family is strong;
　　No worries, no thinking, food allowances bring joy.
　　Hey! The newly elected foreman agrees, impartial and with strong technical skills.
　　We unite and help each other, carefully making steel,
　　Dividing work and cooperating, adding fuel and working hard, discussing problems together.
　　Speaking of dividing work, we divide the work, sticking to our posts and not slacking;
　　You turn on the motor, I prepare the ingredients, taking turns as stokers, doing a good job.
　　We are all young men, working quickly and actively,
　　To melt the iron, to refine the steel.
　　Every time, the furnace bottom is so hard to repair,
　　This time, the furnace bottom must melt a few more furnaces of steel.
　　The weather is really sultry, the task must be completed;
　　The task is so urgent, we forget to eat our meals.
　　Our faces glow red, our sweat drips down;
　　Cheer up, continue to work hard.
　　We are steel, steel will not be tired!
　　Completing the task ahead of schedule, the factory director comes to see,
　　The quality is stronger than before, the work is successfully completed;
　　Recorded in the merit book, explained at the celebration meeting.
　　Positive work and good mood, everyone praises us as good heroes;
　　A red flag is awarded to the whole group, with "Labor Model" written on it.
　　The meeting place is filled with applause, everyone praises:
　　"We must learn from the steelmaking group, we must overcome difficulties!"

    嘿！咱们这组是炼钢！
　　过去受压迫，苦难当！苦难当！
　　只有消极怠工，泡茅房；
　　吸根烟来看看表，磨蹭着到点把工放，
　　月底发薪真不少，每人钞票一大包！？
　　粮店买面还不少，花猫一顿吃下了！
　　父母妻子小孩们，愁眉苦眼饥难熬。
　　如今得到解放，全家身体都强壮；
　　不发愁来，甭思索，食物折合都欢乐。
　　嘿！新选的工长都赞成，不偏不倚技术
　　强。
　　咱们团结互助，细心来炼钢，
　　分工合作加油干，有了问题共商量。
　　说分工来就分工，坚守岗位不放松；
　　你开马达我配料，轮流司炉搞得好。
　　咱们都是小伙子，干活迅速积极搞，
　　要把铁烧化，要把钢炼成。
　　每一次的炉底，是那么难修理，
　　这一次的炉底，要多化几炉出去。
　　天气真闷热，任务必须干完；
　　任务这样紧，忘记把饭餐。
　　咱们脸上放红光，咱们的汗珠往下淌；
　　振起精神来，继续加油干。
　　咱们就是钢铁，钢铁不会有疲倦！
　　提前完成任务，厂长来观看，
　　质量较前强，胜利把活完；
　　功劳簿上作记载，庆功大会说明白。
　　积极工作情绪好，人人皆称好功臣；
　　奖给全组红旗一面，上面写的“劳动模范”。
　　会场一片掌声，个个都称赞：
　　“我们要向炼钢组看齐，我们要克服困难！”
