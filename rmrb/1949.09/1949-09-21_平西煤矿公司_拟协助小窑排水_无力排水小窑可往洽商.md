  　Plans to Assist Small Coal Mines with Drainage
  　Small Coal Mines Unable to Drain Can Negotiate
Editor:
    I am running a small coal mine in Mentougou, Pingxi, in partnership with others. Mining was suspended last year due to the devastation caused by the Kuomintang. After liberation, all shareholders lacked funds. During the flood season, more than forty nearby mines were flooded, and a sum of money must be paid to pump the water out. I wonder if the government can provide a loan? If so, what are the procedures? If the government cannot provide a loan, we are willing to sell the property rights and seek other production opportunities. I wonder if the government can buy it at a price? If buying is possible, where should we apply? I respectfully request a reply!
　　　　　　　　　　Chen Dahao:
    Regarding your letter inquiring about the small coal mine you operate in Mentougou, concerning the government providing a loan or buying it at a price because you are unable to drain the water, we cannot give a specific answer because the letter does not specify the detailed location of the coal mine and the situation after the suspension of mining. Recently, Pingxi Coal Mine Company is preparing to assist small coal mines with drainage to restore production. The drainage costs can be repaid at a reduced price after the coal seam is produced. You can talk to the Pingxi Mining Bureau in Mentougou. If necessary, the bureau can introduce you to negotiate.

　　平西煤矿公司
  　拟协助小窑排水
  　无力排水小窑可往洽商编者：
    我在平西门头沟与人合伙经营一个小煤窑，去年由于国民党的摧残停止开采。解放后各股东均缺乏资金；涨水期间，附近的窑有四十多家都被水淹，欲想抽水必付出一笔资金，不知政府能贷款否？如能，手续如何？如政府不能贷款，我们愿意将产权变卖，另谋生产。不知政府能给价收买否？如收买，向何处申请？敬祈答复！　　　　　　　　　　陈大豪君：
    来函询问关于你在门头沟经营的小窑，因无力抽水，政府是否可以贷款或给价收买的事，因信上未说明煤窑的详细位置和停采后的情形，我们无法作具体答复。最近平西煤矿公司准备协助小窑进行排水，恢复生产，排水费用可俟煤筋出产后再行折价偿还。你可去门头沟平西矿务处一谈，必要时该处可以介绍洽办。 　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　工商局
