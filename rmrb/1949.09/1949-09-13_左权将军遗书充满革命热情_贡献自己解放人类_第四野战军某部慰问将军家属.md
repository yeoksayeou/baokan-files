Xinhua News Agency, Central China Front, 12th. After the People's Liberation Army's Fourth Field Army liberated Liling, Hunan, it sent representatives to Shuijiatang in the county to express condolences to the family of General Zuo Quan, the former Chief of Staff of the Eighteenth Group Army (i.e., the People's Liberation Army), who gloriously sacrificed himself in Taihang Mountain in 1942 during the War of Resistance Against Japan. The representatives expressed their condolences to General Zuo's eighty-year-old mother. The old lady Zuo took out General Zuo Quan's relics that had been buried underground for a long time and gave them to the representatives to see. Among them were photos of the General during the Northern Expedition and the War of Resistance Against Japan, and several letters sent home from Shanxi during the War of Resistance Against Japan. These letters were full of General Zuo's ardent loyalty to the Chinese nation and hatred for the enemies of the people. General Zuo made a clear comparison between the Kuomintang government's passive resistance against Japan at that time and the people's army's persistence in fighting behind enemy lines. The letter also stated: "All of us in the army are determined to fight to the end for the interests of the nation and the country. We didn't have a penny in the past, and we still don't have a penny now, and we still don't want a penny in the future. We suffered in the past, we suffer now, and we are prepared to suffer in the future." General Zuo Quan often used a firm revolutionary outlook on life and infinite confidence in the future of the revolution to educate his family. In a letter to his uncle, General Zuo wrote: "Uncle: Although I cannot go home for the time being, please believe that it is bright and great to contribute everything to the cause of human liberation. I am willing to repay you and my mother for your love and cultivation with the success of my career." The representatives of the People's Liberation Army were extremely moved after reading the letters from Chief of Staff Zuo. They told the old lady Zuo: "The People's Liberation Army led by Chief of Staff Zuo is now inheriting his legacy and advancing bravely under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu. The liberation of all of China is just around the corner. This can be a consolation to Chief of Staff Zuo." The Liling County People's Government has properly taken care of and settled the family members of General Zuo Quan.

　　左权将军遗书充满革命热情
　  贡献自己解放人类
    第四野战军某部慰问将军家属
    【新华社华中前线十二日电】人民解放军第四野战军某部政治部，于解放湖南醴陵后，曾派遣代表前往该县水架塘慰问在抗日战争中于一九四二年在太行山光荣殉国的前十八集团军（即人民解放军）参谋长左权将军的家属。代表们慰问了左将军的八十高龄的母亲。左老太太将久埋地下的左权将军遗物取出，交给代表们看，其中有将军北伐与抗日战争时期的照片，及在抗日战争时期从山西寄回的几封家信。这些家信充满了左将军热爱中华民族的赤胆忠心和对人民公敌的仇恨。左将军把当时国民党政府的消极抗战和人民军队的坚持敌后斗争的情况作了鲜明的对比。信中并说：“我们全军将士都有决心为民族和国家的利益奋斗到底，过去没有一个铜板，现在仍然一文不名，将来也同样一个铜板不要，过去吃苦，现在吃苦，以后准备还要吃苦。”左权将军常以坚定的革命的人生观和对革命前途的无限信心来教育他的家庭。左将军在给他的叔父的一封信中写道：“叔父：虽然我一时不能回家，但是请你相信，贡献自己的一切为人类解放事业而斗争，这一条路是光明的，伟大的。我愿以事业的成功来报答你及母亲对我的慈爱与栽培。”解放军的代表们看了左参谋长的家书后极为感动，他们告诉左老太太说：“左参谋长所带领过的人民解放军现正继承着他的遗志，在毛主席和朱总司令的英明领导下奋勇前进，全中国解放就在眼前。这是可以告慰于左参谋长的”。醴陵县人民政府已对左权将军家属妥为照顾和安置。
