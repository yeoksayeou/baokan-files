Xinhua News Agency, Central China Front, 15th—A frontline reporter in Central China reports on the liberation of Jiangxi Province, stating: With the courageous advance of the People's Liberation Army and the strong support of the people's guerrillas in the old liberated areas of Fujian-Zhejiang-Jiangxi and Hunan-Guangdong-Jiangxi, as well as the broad masses of the people, the entire province of Jiangxi, with the exception of the few county towns of Guangchang, Shicheng, and Xunwu on the Fujian-Jiangxi border, has been completely liberated.

　　After the People's Liberation Army's Western Route Army, which crossed the Yangtze River in late April, joined forces with the people's guerrillas who had persisted in southern Anhui, they marched towards northeastern Jiangxi, liberating the vast areas of northeastern Jiangxi in half a month. On May 3rd and 4th, they captured Guixi, Yiyang, Hengfeng, and other cities in succession, cutting off the so-called "new defense line" on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway boasted by the Kuomintang bandit gang. Then, they divided their forces into three routes to continue advancing in the east, west, and south directions. With the cooperation of the Fujian-Zhejiang-Jiangxi people's guerrillas, the Eastern Route Liberation Army advanced eastward along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, capturing Shangrao, Qianshan, Yushan, Guangfeng, and other cities in succession. The Southern Route took advantage of the victory to advance into northern Fujian. The Western Route Army, after liberating Yujiang, Linchuan, Dongxiang, and Jinxian, liberated Nanchang, the capital of Jiangxi Province, and its outer strongholds of Fengcheng and Zhangshu on May 22nd. The Kuomintang bandit army was routed and disorganized. Everywhere on the highways north of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway for hundreds of miles were weapons, ammunition, grain, and clothing discarded by the bandit army. At the same time, another unit of the Liberation Army liberated Jiujiang on May 17th, sweeping away the remaining Kuomintang bandit troops in the counties of northwestern Jiangxi and advancing south along the Nanxun Railway, victoriously joining forces with the Liberation Army of Nanchang on June 8th.

　　After the Xiang-Gan Campaign began on July 10th, the Jiangxi Liberation Army advanced south and west in two routes along the Gan River and the Nan (chang) Ping (xiang) section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. On July 23rd, they liberated the nationally famous Pingxiang mining area and, before the end of July, eliminated the remaining Kuomintang bandit troops on both banks of the Gan River north of Taihe, laying a good foundation for advancing into southern Jiangxi.

　　The Southern Jiangxi Campaign began on August 8th. The Liberation Army advanced south from Taihe along both banks of the Gan River in a pincer movement, liberating Ganzhou City, an important town in southern Jiangxi, on the 14th. Immediately afterwards, they divided their forces into two routes to continue advancing south. From August 8th to 23rd, in sixteen days, the Liberation Army liberated the areas of Nanfeng, Anyuan, Longnan, and Dingnan in southern Jiangxi, and recovered Ruijin, the People's Capital of the Land Revolution War era. The Southern Jiangxi Campaign basically ended victoriously, paving a victorious road for advancing into Guangdong and directly attacking Guangzhou, the lair of the Kuomintang bandit gang. The Northward Detachment of the Xiang-Min-Gan Border People's Liberation Column joined forces with the southward advancing Liberation Army north of Dayu, after liberating Dayu County. By this point, the revolutionary hometown of the Chinese people—Jiangxi—with the exception of a few county towns such as Guangchang and Shicheng, had been completely liberated. And those few unliberated county towns will certainly be liberated soon.

　　In the war to liberate Jiangxi Province, in addition to the powerful offensive of the People's Liberation Army and the strong cooperation of the people's guerrillas, the broad masses of the people in Jiangxi also enthusiastically supported the Liberation Army in its operations. The ferry workers on the opposite bank of Ganzhou, as soon as our army reached the bank of the Gan River, used the highest speed to bring the three preserved steamships to welcome the People's Liberation Army. The farmers of Xunqu Town in Yongxin County, under Jinggang Mountain, when the enemy retreated, automatically organized more than 100 people to disarm the puppet town government of the town and welcome the Liberation Army to take over. When the Liberation Army moved into the town, the farmers automatically stood guard in the dark to protect our soldiers and cadres. Active elements among the farmers immediately participated in local work, organized district and township governments, and began to raise grain and grass to support the Liberation Army. According to preliminary statistics, in the past three months, the entire province of Jiangxi has raised more than 200 million jin of grain.

　　革命故乡江西解放铺平直捣广州大道
　  前线记者报道江西解放经过
    【新华社华中前线十五日电】华中前线记者报道江西省的解放经过称：在人民解放军奋勇前进和坚持闽浙赣、湘粤赣老解放区的人民游击队及广大人民的有力支援下，江西全省除闽赣边境上的广昌、石城、寻邬几座县城外，已全部获得解放。
    四月下旬横渡长江的人民解放军西路大军与坚持皖南的人民游击队会师后，一路向赣东北挺进，半个月内全部解放了赣东北广大地区，并于五月三、四两日连克贵溪、弋阳、横峰等城，斩断了国民党匪帮吹嘘的所谓浙赣铁路“新防线”。然后分兵三路向东、西、南三个方向继续前进。在闽浙赣人民游击队配合下，东路解放军沿浙赣铁路东进，连克上饶、铅山、玉山、广丰数城；南路乘胜挺进闽北；西路大军则于解放余江、临川、东乡、进贤后，于五月二十二日解放江西省会南昌及其外围据点丰城、樟树等地。国民党匪军溃不成军，在浙赣铁路以北数百里的公路上，到处都是匪军丢弃的武器、弹药、粮食和被服。与此同时，另部解放军于五月十七日解放九江后，一路横扫赣西北各县残余国民党匪军，一路沿南浔铁路南进，于六月八日与解放南昌大军胜利会师。
    七月十日湘赣战役开始后，赣中解放军分两路沿赣江及浙赣路南（昌）萍（乡）段向南向西推进，七月二十三日解放全国闻名的萍乡矿区，并于七月底以前肃清泰和以北赣江两岸国民党残余匪军，为进军赣南建立良好基础。
    赣南战役于八月八日开始，解放军自泰和沿赣江两岸以钳形攻势向南挺进，十四日一举解放赣南重镇赣州城。旋即分兵两路继续南进。自八月八日至二十三日的十六天内解放军解放了赣南南丰、安远、龙南、定南等地区，收复了土地革命战争时代的人民首都瑞金。赣南战役基本上胜利结束，为进军广东直捣国民党匪帮巢穴广州，铺好了一条胜利大道。湘闽赣边人民解放纵队北进支队则于解放大庾县城后，在大庾以北新城和解放军南进大军胜利会师。至此，中国人民革命的故乡——江西，除广昌、石城等几座县城外，已全部获得解放。而那几座未解放的县城，不久也定将解放。
    在解放江西省的战争中，除了强大人民解放军猛烈的攻势和人民游击队的有力配合外，江西广大人民也热烈支援解放军作战。赣州对岸的轮渡工人，在我军刚抵赣江岸时，即以最高的速度将三只保存下来的汽轮开过来迎接人民解放军。井岗山下永新县浔曲镇的农民，当敌人溃退时，即自动组织起一百多人，将该镇伪镇公所缴械，欢迎解放军去接收。解放军进驻该镇时，农民们又在黑夜里自动放哨，保卫我们的战士和干部，农民中积极分子立即参加地方工作，组织区乡政府，开始筹借粮草支援解放军。据初步统计，三个月来，江西全省已筹粮两万万多斤。
