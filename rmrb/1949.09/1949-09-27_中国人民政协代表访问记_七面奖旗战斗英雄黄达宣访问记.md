　　A Visit with Huang Daxuan, Combat Hero with Seven Award Banners
　　Yang Yongping

　　Huang Daxuan is a combat hero of the 117th Division of the Fourth Field Army and also the company commander of a model company that has won seven award banners. He is only twenty-five years old this year, having joined the army at the age of nineteen and fought for six years. During the Anti-Japanese War, he frequently fought the enemy behind enemy lines in northern Jiangsu. Since the Japanese surrender, he has participated in battles at Niangniangmiao, Hartao, Daling, Jingou, Huaide, Changtu, Quantou, Jinzhou, Xinglongdi, Zhangwu, Shenyang, Siping, Dehui, Lalatun, the Liaoxi-Shenyang Campaign, and the liberation of Tianjin. He was transferred from northern Jiangsu to the Northeast, and during the Great March, he went from the Northeast to the South of the Yangtze River, always standing on the front lines of the war.

　　His company won its first "Model Company for Overcoming Fortifications" award banner in August 1944 during the battle of Lingongdu. In August 1945, during the battle of Xiang'an, he was still a machine gunner and one of the four members of the assault team. When they approached the enemy sentry post, the enemy sentry noticed them and turned to run. They followed closely, and as the enemy entered the first fence gate, they followed them inside. The enemy entered the second fence gate, but failed to close the gate. The third gate was closed by the enemy, but they smashed it open. In this way, they broke through three gates in fifteen minutes, opening a path for the follow-up troops. The battle ended in forty-five minutes, with forty-five enemies captured.

　　In 1947, during the first battle of the winter offensive in the Northeast, the Battle of Zhangwu, he was a platoon leader. His company's task was to capture Gaoling south of Zhangwu. Gaoling was the barrier to Zhangwu City, and the enemy had built three fortifications: east, west, and center. His platoon attacked the western corner of Gaoling, where the enemy had built five obstacles, three barbed wire fences, and twelve bunkers connected by covered trenches. The covered trenches were invisible from the surface, and the bunker doors were hard to find, but he clearly assigned tasks to his platoon, moved quickly, and skillfully used the terrain to blow up the covered trenches. The platoon drove off the defending enemy with explosions and intimidation. This was the first platoon to complete its task of capturing Gaoling. He received a special merit for this battle. The division headquarters called on all infantry platoons to learn from the third platoon and especially praised his command abilities. His company received the "Iron Party Army" award banner in this battle.

　　During the large-scale training exercises from May to August 1948, he promoted military democracy and inspired everyone's wisdom. His company did very well. In the summary, this company was the fastest and best in earthwork operations. Thirty soldiers in the company were commended, one-third of the squad leaders were commended, half of the platoon leaders were commended, and all the company leaders were commended. They received the "Excellent in Learning" award banner. At this time, he was the deputy company commander. In addition to leading training, improving the company's food was also an important task for the deputy company commander. Under his leadership, the quartermaster department ensured that the entire company did not eat the same dishes for three meals a day. Among the twenty-two units in the regiment, they were still number one in improving living standards within the prescribed food standards, and the company had won the battalion's award banner three times.

　　The results of his company's training were demonstrated during the battle of Tianjin. Among the spearhead companies of the main attack regiment, they used the strength of one company to defeat a defending enemy battalion, capturing all their weapons. In the battle summary, they received the "Sharp as a Knife" and "Completely Annihilate the Stubborn Enemy" award banners. At this time, he was the company commander. As the Northeast advanced into the interior, they received the "Victory in the Advance" award banner. The "Three Major Excellence" award banner was received when summarizing work from October to December, encompassing combat, consolidation, and discipline.

　　This time attending the CPPCC meeting, he was elected as an alternate representative of the Fourth Field Army. (Image attached)

　　中国人民政协代表访问记
  　七面奖旗战斗英雄黄达宣访问记
    杨永平
    黄达宣是第四野战军一一七师的战斗英雄，又是得了七面奖旗的模范连的连长。他今年才二十五岁，从十九岁就参加部队，到现在打了六年仗。抗日时期在苏北敌后经常和敌人作战。从日寇投降以后，参加过娘娘庙、哈尔套、大岭、金沟、怀德、昌图、泉头、锦州、兴龙地、彰武、沈阳、四平、德惠、拉拉屯、辽西会战、解放天津等战役。从苏北调到东北，大进军时又从东北打到江南，始终站到战争的最前线。
    他那连得第一面“攻坚模范连”奖旗是在一九四四年八月打林公渡时得的。一九四五年八月打襄安时，他还是一个机枪射手，是参加突击组四名中的一个。当他们摸到敌人岗哨跟前时，敌人哨兵发觉后转身就跑，他们跟着紧追，敌人刚进第一道栅栏门他们就跟进去了，敌人进第二栅栏门关门没关住，第三道门敌人把门关住了，又被他们撞开了，就这样十五分钟连破三道门，给后续部队打开通路，这场仗四十五分钟就结束了，俘敌四十五名。
    四七年东北我军冬季攻势第一炮彰武之战，他那时当了排长，他那连的任务是攻占彰武以南的高岭，这座高岭是彰武城的屏障，敌人在高岭修着东西中三处工事，他这排打高岭西角，敌人在西角修有五道障碍、三道铁丝网，十二个地堡中间有盖沟连着，从地皮上看不到盖沟、找不到地堡门，但他指挥的一个排分配任务明确，动作快，善于利用地形爆炸盖沟，把一排守敌连炸带震赶跑了，这是攻占高岭最先完成任务的一个排，他在这次战斗中立了特功，师部号召各步兵排向三排看齐，特别表扬了他的指挥才能，他那连在此次战斗中得了“铁的党军”奖旗。
    四八年五月到八月大练兵时，发扬军事民主，启发大家智慧，他这连作的很好，总结时这连土木作业最快最好，全连有三十个战士立功，班级干部三分之一立了功，排级干部半数立功，连级干部全部立功，得到“学习优胜”奖旗。他这时是副连长，当副连长除领导练兵外改善全连伙食也是重要的任务，在他领导下的事务处保证了全连一天三餐不吃重菜，在全团二十二个单位中在规定以伙食标准改善生活，直到现在还数第一，连得过营里三次奖旗。
    他这连练兵的成绩在打天津时表现出来，在主攻团尖刀连中他们以一连人的兵力解决守敌一个营，缴获了全部武器，总结战斗时得到“锐如尖刀”，“全歼顽敌”两面奖旗，这时他当了连长，以东北往关内进军得到“进军胜利”奖旗。“三大优胜”奖旗是总结十月到十二月间工作时得到的，是战斗、巩固、纪律。
    这次出席政协会议，他当选为四野的候补代表。（附图片）
