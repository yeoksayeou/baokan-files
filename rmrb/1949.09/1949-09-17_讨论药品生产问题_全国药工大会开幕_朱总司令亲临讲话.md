Discussing Pharmaceutical Production Issues
  National Pharmaceutical Workers' Conference Opens
  Commander-in-Chief Zhu De Attends and Speaks
    [Our Newspaper's Report] The Second National Pharmaceutical Workers' Conference, convened by the Military Commission's Health Department, opened in Peiping on the 14th. More than 50 representatives and guests attended, including directors of pharmaceutical factories from various regions, heads of materials departments, and representatives from North China, Northeast China, Central China, East China, Northwest China, Shanghai, and various field armies. Commander-in-Chief Zhu De attended and delivered a speech. The central focus of the conference is to discuss how to mass-produce pharmaceuticals nationwide and achieve scientific and unified management.
    In his speech, Commander-in-Chief Zhu De pointed out that the development of pharmaceutical science should catch up with the development of medicine in China, and that refined extracts should be made from traditional Chinese medicine to replace some Western medicines, in order to achieve self-reliance. He said: In the past, the pharmaceutical industry in the liberated areas mainly served the military. In the future, attention should be paid to serving the people, and educational and research institutions should be established in various places. Commander-in-Chief Zhu De compared the development of the pharmaceutical industry under three different social systems (feudal society, capitalist society, and socialist society), pointing out that only in socialist Soviet Union can pharmacy achieve true development and serve the majority of the people. Therefore, we should learn from the Soviet Union. Finally, Commander-in-Chief Zhu De stated that the pharmaceutical industry in China must develop, and the government must support it. Minister of Health Su Jingguan told the attending representatives that the future of the pharmaceutical industry is bright. He once again pointed out that our policy is self-reliance and self-sufficiency, and criticized the erroneous idea that "diseases cannot be treated without American medicine." He also pointed out that the pharmaceutical work in the liberated areas in the past was successful and solved the difficulties at that time. Now, due to the lack of unified production, a false impression of "overproduction" of some medicines in some areas has been created, while other areas feel a shortage of medicines. He further explained that the responsibilities in the future are even greater than in the past. As factories expand, it is necessary to study scientific management and planned production. Deputy Minister Fu reported that in the future, the pharmaceutical industry should aim to supply the countryside from the cities, public and private pharmaceutical factories should help each other, and all parties should cooperate and unite to mass-produce, improve quality, and create and invent more. He also emphasized that in the future, attention should be paid to the production of preventive medicines to strengthen epidemic prevention work. Finally, Deputy Minister Jiang spoke. The meeting adjourned at 7:00 PM. The attending representatives will be divided into groups to continue discussing various specific issues.

　　讨论药品生产问题
  　全国药工大会开幕
  　朱总司令亲临讲话
    【本报讯】军委卫生部召开的第二届药工大会于十四日在平开幕。到各地区药厂厂长、材料处长、华北、东北、华中、华东、西北、上海及各野战军等代表及来宾五十余人，朱总司令亲临讲话。会议中心是研讨如何使全国大量生产药品及科学化统一管理等问题。
    朱总司令讲话中，指出今后药学事业，要赶上医学在中国的发展，并应从中药中提炼精制，来代替一部分西药，以求得自力更生。他说：过去解放区药学事业主要是为军队服务，今后要注意为老百姓服务，并且要在各地成立教育研究机构。朱总司令列举在三种不同的社会制度（封建社会、资本主义社会、社会主义社会）下药学事业发展的情形，作了比较，指出只有在社会主义的苏联，药学才能得到真正的发展，才能为大多数人服务，所以应该向苏联学习。最后，朱总司令说明药学事业在中国必须发展，政府一定要加以支持。卫生部苏井观部长告诉到会代表，制药事业前途是光明的。并再一次指出我们的方针是自力更生、自给自足，对“没有美药就不能治病”的错误思想，给予了批判。同时指出过去解放区的药学工作是有成绩的，解决了当时的困难；现在由于生产的不统一，以致形成部分地区部分药品假象的“生产过剩”，而另一地区却感到药品缺乏。他并说明今后的责任更较过去重大，工厂扩大了，就必须研究科学化管理和有计划的生产。傅副部长报告今后药学事业要做到城市供给乡村，公私药厂间要互助，各方面要合作团结，大量生产，提高质量，多多创造与发明。并强调今后应注意防疫药品的生产，以加强防疫工作等。最后姜副部长讲话。直至七时宣告休会。到会代表将分成小组，继续讨论各项具体问题。
