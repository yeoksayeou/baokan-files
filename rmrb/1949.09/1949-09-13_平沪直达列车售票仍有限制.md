To the Editor:

　　Since the opening of the direct train between Beiping and Shanghai, the people have found it very convenient. However, I recently saw in the newspaper that among the twenty-six major stations along the route, passenger tickets are not sold at cities other than major cities such as Jinan, Xuzhou, and Nanjing. I don't know why? If the general public has urgent business in Cangxian or Boz镇, they have to buy tickets to Jinan, which is quite uneconomical. I wonder when all twenty-six stations along the route will be able to sell tickets? I hope you can answer this!

Dear Mr. Zhang Jing:

　　The Ministry of Railways has provided the following response to your question: Editor

　　Although the direct train between Beiping and Shanghai stops at twenty-six major stations, due to the large number of passengers, restrictions must be imposed on short-distance passengers in order to avoid overcrowding and to take care of long-distance passengers. Therefore, there is a regulation that only tickets to Dexian and points south are sold. Short-distance passengers going to places such as Cangxian and Botou can take other trains. In the future, if the number of direct trains increases and the transportation capacity is improved, this restriction can be lifted. (Ministry of Railways of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission of China)

### 平沪直达列车售票仍有限制

　　平沪直达列车售票仍有限制编辑同志：
    平沪间直达车自通车后，人民莫不称便。见日前报载沿途二十六个大站中，除了济南、徐州、南京等大城市外，其余的城市均不售客票，不知何故？一般群众因有急事赴沧县或泊镇等处，都得买济南票，颇感不大经济。惟不知何日沿途二十六站均能售票，望予以解答为祷！  　
　张靖张靖先生：
    你的问题承铁道部答复如下：  编者
    平沪直通列车虽然在二十六个大站停车，但因乘车旅客过多，为了免除拥挤并照顾长途旅客起见，对于短途旅客不得不加以限制，故有只发售到达德县以南客票的规定。而赴沧县泊头等地之短途旅客可乘坐其他车次，将来如直通列车车次增加输送量提高时，这种限制办法即可取消。（中国人民革命军事委员会铁道部）
