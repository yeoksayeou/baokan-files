Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 10th—The remnant Kuomintang bandit gang in Guangzhou, facing collapse, is frantically destroying and plundering national wealth and civilian goods. According to a report in the Shanghai Wenhui Daily: The various banks and bureaus in South China and Southwest China controlled by the four major families are transferring funds to Hong Kong, and then from Hong Kong to the United States, the Philippines, Siam, South America, and other places. The puppet Bank of Communications is using the "Philippine Bank of Communications," registered with the Philippine government, as a center to transfer assets to the Philippines. The bandit "United Logistics Headquarters" Guangzhou Clothing Factory and the 18th Arsenal are being moved to Yulin Port on Hainan Island, but this is being opposed by workers. Several warehouse explosions have occurred in Guangzhou recently to cover up their crimes of stealing and selling national materials. According to a Central News Agency dispatch: the puppet "Ministry of Economic Affairs" recently formulated a so-called "Measures for Evacuating Civilian Goods Approaching Communist Areas," stipulating that all military supplies, metals, raw materials, and export products produced by factories and mines in these areas should be dismantled and moved to Taiwan, Hong Kong, Guangdong, Guiyang, Chongqing, and other places. In addition, the Kuomintang bandit gang is also extracting grain from farmers in the areas awaiting liberation. Sichuan Province alone has been ordered to hand over 4.5 million shi of "requisitioned" grain this year.

　　广州残余匪帮
　  盗卖国家财富掠夺民间物资
    【新华社北平十日电】面临覆没的广州国民党残余匪帮正疯狂破坏、掠夺国家财富和民间物资。据上海文汇报消息：四大家族控制下的华南及西南各行、局，正纷纷将资金转往香港，然后再由港转遁美国、菲律宾、暹罗、南美等地。伪交通银行正以经菲律宾政府注册的“菲律宾交通银行”为中心，向菲律宾转移资产。匪“联勤总部”广州被服厂和十八兵工厂正在迁往海南岛的榆林港，但遭到工人的反对。广州市最近接连发生多次仓库爆炸事件，以掩饰他们盗卖国家物资罪行。另据国民党中央社消息披露：伪“经济部”最近又制定一项掠夺民间物资的所谓“接近共区民间物资疏运办法”，规定凡属这些地区的工厂，矿厂所产之军需品、金属、原料、外销品等均即拆移，疏运至台湾、香港、广东及贵阳、重庆等地。此外，国民党匪帮并在尽情地榨取待解放区各地农民粮食，仅四川一省即被规定今年须缴出“征借”粮四百五十万市石。
