Notification from the Tax Bureau of the People's Government of Beiping Municipality
(38 Ping Shui Lin Zi No. 2084) September 8, 1949

　　(1) In this city, in the collection of income tax from profit-making businesses for the second half of 1948, most industrial and commercial households actively paid taxes, but a few attempted to conceal and evade taxes. During the census and registration process, they were only registered after being reported by the masses and through in-depth investigations by this Bureau. However, according to recent reports from citizens, there are still individual industrial and commercial households operating secretly, consistently failing to register and pay taxes, attempting to evade taxes and increasing the burden on others. In order to balance the burden, it is specifically stipulated that from now until September 15th, it will be a period for self-reporting and registration. It is hoped that they will voluntarily go to their respective tax sub-bureaus to register.

　　(2) All industrial and commercial households that have already registered or will subsequently register this time, who have not paid the business tax for the spring of this year, should report to their respective tax sub-bureaus and pay the spring business tax from now until September 15th.

　　If the above is not reported within the time limit, it will be dealt with strictly as tax evasion once reported by the masses or discovered by this Bureau.

　　北平市人民政府税务局通告
    ３８平税临字第２０８４号三十八年九月八日
    （一）本市征收三十七年下半年营利事业所得税，一般工商户都很踊跃纳税，只有少数企图隐匿漏税。在普查登记过程中，经群众检举及本局深入调查后，方才登记。但近据市民反映，仍有个别工商户暗中营业，一贯的不登记纳税，企图逃税而加重他人负担，兹为使负担平衡计，特规定自即日起至九月十五日止为自报登记时期。务希自动向各该管税务分局进行。
    （二）凡此次已登记或今后续行登记工商户，未纳本年春季营业税者，应自即日起至九月十五日止，务向各该管税务分局申报，补缴春季营业税。
    以上倘逾期不报，经群众检举或本局查出，即以逃税从严处理。
    局长　赵子尚
    副局长　彭涛
