Revisiting the Fengtai Locomotive Depot
(Our reporter Xing Jun)

　　When this reporter visited the Fengtai Locomotive Depot in May of this year, it was the third month of the depot's implementation of the responsibility system. After locomotive assignment to specific crews, and cleaning competitions, the locomotives were in good condition, the number of locomotives in operation was relatively reduced, and the average daily mileage per locomotive increased from 84 kilometers in March to 231 kilometers; the contract inspection and repair system in the factory had just begun. When I recently returned there, the situation had developed further. Due to continuous improvements to the railway lines and the increasingly shorter time required for locomotives to enter the depot, the average daily mileage per locomotive in August increased to 308.9 kilometers, and fuel consumption was reduced from 425 kilograms per ten thousand ton-kilometers to 340 kilograms; and three relatively outstanding locomotives emerged. Regarding this, the depot chief told the reporter: "If we use six criteria to measure exemplary locomotives – good maintenance, many safe kilometers traveled, good solidarity and mutual assistance, high fuel efficiency, high technical speed, and strong tractive force – the 'May 1st Labor' locomotive already meets the first four conditions; No. 1939 has achieved the first three; and No. 1727 stands out most in the fifth." He also said: "When the contract crew system was implemented, the entire depot set a 100-day safe kilometer target; because some crew members had poor operating skills, locomotive No. 1784 had a responsibility accident of proceeding past a stop signal on July 17th, and the plan was not completed. But everyone was not discouraged. After reviewing the situation, they immediately set a new goal of 300,000 safe kilometers, and have now reached 180,000 kilometers without an accident. This fact tells everyone that there is a need for mutual improvement among the locomotives. Soon, the 'May 1st Labor' locomotive took the initiative to unite with No. 1939, No. 1925, and four other locomotives to form a joint labor group, formulating a work plan for joint maintenance and cleaning of the group's locomotives, saving oil and fuel, strictly adhering to speed limits, and labor discipline of not being late or leaving early, obeying the group leader's leadership, and not dozing off while driving. This gradually influenced the entire depot. From then on, within each joint labor group, those off-duty helped those on-duty to prepare the locomotives and carry out scheduled inspections, and those who were absent due to illness or other reasons automatically filled in for them. For example, on August 22nd, the No. 762 locomotive, which was responsible for train No. 152 and returned at 13:00, had a broken spring leaf on the right trailing wheel, which had to be replaced, but it had to run the next route at 14:11. If we had relied solely on the workers, it would have inevitably delayed the train, but thanks to the help of the joint labor group, the task was completed in 20 minutes, ensuring the scheduled departure."

　　In terms of factory maintenance, in order to better implement the contract inspection and repair system, the depot reorganized its production organization in early June according to work needs. The original Class B and C inspection groups were reduced from 44 people per group to 24 people; the Class A inspection group of 40 people was divided into two groups, each supplemented to 32 people, using two Class A inspection platforms to implement contract repair separately. Based on the crew members' level of learning about maintenance, the daily inspection staff was eliminated, and seven people were fixed to implement contract inspection separately. A strict acceptance system was established. All locomotives undergoing Class A inspection, regardless of whether they belonged to this depot or another, were subject to detailed inspection by the factory in conjunction with the technical department and the engine drivers. Any non-standard items were re-repaired, and the locomotive was jointly signed off only after the engine driver considered it to be in good condition. In this way, not only was the repair of locomotives with and without fire gradually eliminated, but also, because the crew members actually participated in Class B and C inspections, working hours were greatly reduced. According to the statistics of one locomotive inspected in each of the three months of June, July, and August: Class A inspection averaged 1,803 man-hours in June, exceeding the bureau's standard man-hours of 1,650 by 9%; 1,360 man-hours in July, a reduction of 18%; and 1,286 man-hours in August, a reduction of 21%. Class B inspection averaged 99 man-hours in June, a reduction of 46% compared to the standard man-hours of 185; 83 in July, a reduction of 55%; and 83 in August as well. Class C inspection averaged 85 man-hours in June, a reduction of 37% compared to the standard man-hours of 135; and 67 in both July and August, a reduction of 50%. Because the quality of maintenance has improved, not only has the established practice of single-machine test runs been broken, reducing a large amount of consumption, but also paving the way for the cyclical operation system implemented in September. Recently, in order to further improve work efficiency, on the basis of the isolated contract crew, contract inspection, and contract repair in each department, it has developed into a fixed number of locomotive groups and a certain inspection and repair organization or personnel, implementing fixed organization to engage in overall joint labor.

　　The vigorous development of Fengtai locomotive work, or one could say the basic key to the growth of China's new type of railway, lies in the combination of the Soviet Union's advanced experience and the working class's enthusiasm. The experience is readily available, but the workers' awareness is not something that happens overnight. In the early days after the liberation of Fengtai, the situation within the depot was complex, filled with factional organizations or reactionary groups such as "three-dynasty veterans," "Qiao's carriage shop," "Li's machine factory," and "North Tyrant," spreading rumors and disrupting the unity of the workers. Under the guidance of resolutely relying on the working class, the depot's leadership carried out the work of mobilizing the masses to expose bad people in a planned manner, and dealt with them according to the severity of their offenses, punishing them according to the law (four people), exonerating (six people), and conducting collective training (eleven people), and the workers' morale began to stabilize. Later, a large number of activists were promoted from daily work to serve as leading cadres (including one helper promoted to deputy foreman, seven drivers promoted to driver chiefs and guiding drivers, two construction workers, two directors, and three foremen and inspectors promoted to director), and backward workers were patiently educated. A more effective example is Chen Qiude, a technical apprentice who used to be unmotivated in his work and indulged in eating, drinking, whoring, and gambling, with debts piling up at his door. After education and transformation, he is now active. Long Yuchun is a skilled technician and expert in the theory of automatic mechanism construction of air brakes. He was passive and sluggish during the Kuomintang rule, and remained the same after liberation, often making strange remarks. The depot chief often educated him through casual conversations, constantly praising his strengths. He was gradually moved, admitted his mistake of not making progress after liberation, and vowed to correct his past mistakes. Later, when the crew members learned maintenance, he served as an instructor for the air brake section, working very hard and being very popular. Through correct leadership and a difficult transformation process, the depot enhanced and consolidated the workers' awareness and enthusiasm; coupled with the attitude of the entire depot, from top to bottom, humbly learning, it has achieved today's accomplishments.

　　再访丰台机务段
    （本报记者邢军）
    今年五月，记者访问丰台机务段时，正是该段推行负责制的第三月。机车包乘后，经过清扫竞赛，状态良好，运用台数相对减少，平均日车公里从三月份的八十四公里提高到二百三十一公里；工厂的包检包修刚刚开始。当我最近再到那里的时候，情况发展了。由于线路不断改进，和机车入库时间日益缩短，八月份日车公里平均提高到三百零八点九公里，燃料消耗由万吨公里四百二十五公斤，减至三百四十公斤；并出现三台比较出色的机车。就此，该段段长语记者：“如果以保修良好，安全走行公里多，团结互助好，节省燃料多，技术速度高，索引力强六项作为典型机车的标准来衡量，五一劳动号已具备前四个条件；一九三九号作到了前三项；一七二七号以第五项最突出。”他又说：“当实行包乘时，全段曾订出百日安全公里计划；因为有的乘务员操纵技术不好，一七八四号机车，在七月十七日发生冒进出发信号的责任事故，计划未完成。但大家没有灰心，经过检讨，立即定出三十万安全公里目标，现已达十八万公里无事故。这一事实告诉大家：各机车有相互提高的必要。不久，五一劳动号主动联合一九三九号、一九二五号等四台机车，成立了联合劳动组，制定本组机车共同检修清扫，节省油类燃料，严守限制速度的工作计划，和不迟到早退，服从组长领导，行车不盹睡等劳动纪律。并逐渐影响全段。从此，各联合劳动组内，休班者帮助当班的整备机车，执行定检，因事病缺勤者自动替班。如八月二十二日，担当一五二次十三点归来的七六二号机车，右从轮弹簧片折损，必须更换，但十四点十一分还要跑交路，假使单靠工匠势必延误行车，幸在联合劳动组的帮助下，二十分钟完成任务，保证了定点开出。”
    在工厂检修方面，为更好的贯彻包检包修制，该段于六月初，按照工作需要，重新调整了生产组织。将原来乙丙检每组四十四人，减为二十四人；甲检一组四十人，分为两组，每组补充到三十二人，使用两个甲检台，分别实行包修。根据乘务员学习检修的程度，取消日常检查员，固定七人分别实行包检。并建立了严格的验收制。凡机车甲检完竣，不分本段外段，均由工厂会同技术、司机长，施行细密检查，发现不合标准处，予以重修，待司机长认为状态良好，方共同签名。如此，不但逐渐绝灭有火及无火机车修理，而且由于乘务员实际参加乙丙检修，大大节省了工时。据六、七、八三个月分别定检一辆机车的统计：甲检六月份平均用一千八百零三工时，较局定标准工时一千六百五十超过百分之九；七月用一千三百六十，减百分之十八；八月用一千二百八十六，减百分之二十一。乙检六月份平均用九十九工时，较标准工时一百八十五减百分之四十六；七月用八十三，减百分之五十五；八月也是用八十三。丙检六月份平均用八十五工时，较标准工时一百三十五减百分之三十七；七、八两月均用六十七，减百分之五十。因为检修质量提高，不但打破单机试运转的成规，减少大批消耗，且为九月份实行的循环运转制开辟了道路。最近为进一步提高工作效率，在各部门孤立性的包乘、包检、包修基础上，发展为一定数量的机车组和一定的检修组织或人员，实行固定编组，从事整体的联合劳动。
    丰台机务工作的蓬勃发展，或说中国人民新型铁路成长的基本关键，在于苏联的先进经验和工人阶级的热情相结合。经验是现成的，但工人的觉悟却不是一个早晨的事。丰台解放后的初期，段内情况复杂，布满什么“三朝元老”，“乔家车房”，“李家机厂”，“北霸天”等宗派组织或反动集团；造谣惑众，破坏职工团结。段的领导上在坚决依靠工人阶级的方针下，有计划的进行了发动群众检举坏人工作，并根据情节轻重，分前予以法办（四名）、洗刷（六名）和集训（十一名），职工情绪开始稳定下来。后从日常工作中，提拔了大批积极分子，充当领导干部（计帮工提副工长一，司机提司机长、指导司机七、工务员二、主任二，监工、检查员提主任者三），和耐心教育了落后工友。收效较大的，如技术小工陈秋德，过去工作不积极，吃喝嫖赌，帐堆满门。经过教育改造，现已积极起来。隆雨春是个技术优良、精通自动机构造理论的风闸匠，国民党统治时期消极怠工，解放后依然如故，并常讲怪话，段长经常从漫谈中对他进行教育，不断表扬他的长处，他渐渐感动了，承认自己解放后不长进的错误，发誓痛改前非，后乘务员学习检修，他担任了风闸部分的教员，非常努力，很受大家欢迎。该段这样经过正确的领导和艰苦的改造过程，提高与巩固了职工的觉悟和热情；再加全段自上而下虚心学习的态度，便获得了今天的成就。
