　　People's Inner Mongolia Daily
　　[Dispatch from Ulanhot from this newspaper] The Inner Mongolia Daily has been in publication for one year and eight months. Its connection with the broad masses of the people of Inner Mongolia is growing daily. According to statistics from January to July of last year, a total of 790,747 copies of the Inner Mongolia Daily in both Han and Mongolian languages were distributed. In the past eight months of this year, the newspaper has distributed 1,167,458 copies, with sales increasing sharply. In order to widely publicize the Party's various policies and improve the political and cultural level of the Han and Mongolian working people, the newspaper publishes various books and magazines in addition to distributing newspapers. From January to July of last year, a total of 30 kinds of Mongolian and Chinese books were translated and printed, totaling more than 64,000 copies, including Chairman Mao's "The Present Situation and Our Tasks," the Constitution of the Communist Party of China, "How to Understand the National Question," the Cominform resolution, "Dialectical Materialism," children's books, and scientific knowledge. The publishing house also published two periodicals, "People's Knowledge" and "Inner Mongolia Pictorial," with a circulation of nearly 20,000 copies. From January to August of this year, the publishing house published 45 kinds of Mongolian books alone, totaling more than 77,700 copies. This situation powerfully demonstrates that the cultural life of the people of Inner Mongolia is constantly developing.
　　For hundreds of years, the people of Inner Mongolia suffered from the cruel rule and oppression of alien invaders. The Manchus, the Northern Warlords, the Kuomintang reactionaries, and the Japanese imperialists used various vicious methods to plunder the wealth of the people of Inner Mongolia; the feudal ruling class of Inner Mongolia aided and abetted the evildoers, making the people of Inner Mongolia extremely poor, and the Inner Mongolian economy stagnated for a long time at the backward natural economic level of "tea, cloth, water pipe tobacco, sugar, cattle, horses, camels, and sheep." This political and economic situation determined the shockingly backward cultural life of the people of Inner Mongolia, and the people basically could not see books and newspapers. After the people of Inner Mongolia were liberated, reforms and construction work began in the political and economic fields. Under the leadership of the Inner Mongolia Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Inner Mongolia Daily was also born last year. In addition to publishing domestic and foreign current affairs and political news, the newspaper also publishes several special publications, such as the literary special publication "Grassland," the international political and economic special publication "Weekly Digest," the worker's learning production special publication "Employee Production," and the communications business special publication "News Work." In addition, there are special publications such as "Medicine and Health," "Education," "Learning," and "Farmers and Herdsmen," with lively and rich content, which are very popular among readers. In August of this year, the newspaper summarized its work since its founding and believed that since this year, the guiding nature of the newspaper has been strengthened, and relevant commentaries have generally been organized in coordination with current work. The scope has also been broadened, and more attention has been paid to reports on forestry areas, pastoral areas, and fishing and hunting issues compared to the past, which is of great significance to Inner Mongolia's work and the people of Inner Mongolia.

　　人民的内蒙古日报
    【本报乌兰浩特市专电】内蒙古日报创刊迄今，已经一年又八个月了。它与内蒙广大人民的联系，与日俱增。据去年一至七月份的统计，内蒙古日报汉蒙文版共发行七十九万零七百四十七份。今年八个月来，该报已发行了一百一十六万七千四百五十八份，销数急剧增加。该报社为了广泛宣扬党的各种政策，提高汉蒙劳动人民的政治与文化水平，与发行报纸同时，又出版了各种书籍杂志。去年一至七月，共译印蒙汉文的书籍三十种，共六万四千余册，其中包括毛主席的目前形势与我们的任务，中国共产党党章，怎样了解民族问题，九国共产党情报局决议，辩证法唯物论，儿童读物，科学常识等。该社并出版了“人民知识”及“内蒙画报”两种期刊，印刷近两万份。今年一月到八月份，该社仅蒙文书籍即出版了四十五种，达七万七千七百余册。这种情况有力的说明，内蒙人民的文化生活是在不断发展中。
    内蒙人民几百年来，受尽了异族侵略者残酷的统治压迫。满清、北洋军阀、国民党反动派、日本帝国主义者，曾以各种毒辣的手法，搜刮内蒙民脂民膏；内蒙的封建统治阶级则助纣为虐，使得内蒙人民贫困不堪，内蒙经济长时期停滞在“茶布水烟糖，牛马骆驼羊”的落后的自然经济水平上。这种政治经济状况，决定了内蒙人民文化生活惊人的落后，人民的书籍报纸是根本看不到的。内蒙人民获得解放以后，政治、经济等方面都开始了改革与建设工作，在中共内蒙古党委会领导下的内蒙古日报，也在去年诞生了，该报除刊载国内外时事政治新闻外，还出版了好几种专刊，如文艺专刊—“草原”，国际政治经济专刊—“每周文摘”，工人学习生产专刊—“职工生产”，通讯业务专刊——“新闻工作”，此外尚有“医药卫生”，“教育”，“学习”，“农牧民”……等专刊，内容活泼丰富，颇受读者欢迎。今年八月，该报总结了创刊以来的工作，认为今年以来，报纸的指导性是加强了，配合当前工作，一般都组织了有关的言论。范围也广大了，较之过去，更加注意了林业区、游牧区以及渔业、打猎等问题的报导，这对于内蒙工作与内蒙人民是有着重大意义的。
