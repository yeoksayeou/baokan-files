　　The Soviet People's Struggle to Defend Peace
    By A. Surkov, translated by Tang Ren
    Enslavement of the people of all countries, economic plunder, war—these are the words engraved on the black banner of the criminal clique of rulers in the imperialist camp.
    This camp of "masters of the art of death" represents a handful of parasites who are accustomed to exploiting the blood and sweat of millions of working people, who are the exploited slaves of capitalism. Confronting it is the vast camp of supporters of peace and progress, under whose banner the forces of progressive laboring humanity are united.
    The entire historical process of the past thirty years has determined that the Soviet Union, the first socialist country of the world's working people, should stand at the head of this camp.
    The Soviet Union, the great guarantor of peace, has won indisputable prestige through its consistent struggle against reactionary and aggressive forces over the past thirty years.
    From the very moment it seized power, the Soviet government has pursued a consistent policy of peace among nations. One of the main slogans put forward by the Bolsheviks in preparing for the Great October Revolution was "struggle for immediate peace, without annexations or indemnities."
    One of the first decrees issued by the Soviet regime was the Decree on Peace. It was certainly not the fault of the Soviet people that the imperialists of Germany and the Entente responded to this call for peace with a war of intervention against the young workers' and peasants' state.
    In the period between the two world wars, the working people of the world recognized the Soviet Union as a selfless fighter for peace among nations.
    Inside and outside the ill-fated League of Nations, the Soviet government advocated universal disarmament as the most reliable guarantee of peace, and exposed the imperialist nature of the Anglo-French rulers of the League's policy of "security" first and then "disarmament." The Soviet government pointed out that this policy was encouraging an arms race and would inevitably lead to a new world war.
    Soviet public opinion and the government repeatedly warned the world that the capitalist governments' policy of "appeasement" of the aggressive actions and plans of Fascist Germany, Italy, and Japan was endangering humanity.
    Among the great powers, only the Soviet government was not disgraced by betrayal in the face of the Italian Fascist aggression against Abyssinia, the Japanese aggression against China, the German and Italian Fascist aggression against Republican Spain, the Nazi occupation of Austria and Czechoslovakia, and Hitler's aggression against Yugoslavia.
    This was the situation before the Second World War. When the war began, the imminent threat to Britain and the United States from the imperialist "Berlin-Rome-Tokyo Axis" (intoxicated by its easy "victories") forced the rulers of Britain and the United States to fight alongside the Soviet Union. This common struggle brought victory to the Allied countries. But after Britain and the United States committed many acts of betrayal against their ally, the Soviet Union, and did everything possible to obstruct the resistance movements in the countries occupied by the fascists, Anglo-American capitalists went further, attempting to weaken the Soviet Union as much as possible during the war; and in order to preserve themselves, they opposed the political activities of the laboring people liberated from fascist enslavement, political activities that had matured in the flames of resistance.
    However, their calculations failed, and their treacherous conspiracy did not achieve the desired results. Because the Soviet Union shouldered the entire burden of the struggle against the combined forces of Hitler and his vassals, on the day of victory, it made the world see the Soviet Union's inexhaustible strength shining with worldwide brilliance. Hundreds of millions of working people in all countries expressed their gratitude to the Soviet Union, regarding it as the benefactor who liberated the people of all countries from the fascist yoke.
    At no time in history have the blind, bestial instincts of greed, malice, and fear been wise guides in international political events. But today, in the mid-twentieth century, those who are attempting to restore the dark past of the "Holy Alliance" and are setting out to become the world's policemen are driven by these three instincts.
    These people launched their criminal adventure in Greece while the war was still going on, sending General Scobie's troops against the heroic resistance fighters of democracy. After the war, the executioners of Truman were added to the executioners of Churchill. To this day, together with the royalist fascist bandits of Tsaldaris, they continue to stain the mountains and rivers of Greece with the blood of Greece's finest sons and daughters.
    These people stood idly by during the war as Chiang Kai-shek passively resisted Japan but actively opposed the people's democratic army led by the heroic Chinese Communist Party—the true patriots of China. After the war, American imperialists spent hundreds of millions of dollars, extorted from American taxpayers, on their puppets, even though these puppets were despised and hated by the Chinese people.
    These people encouraged the civil wars in India and Pakistan, Siam and Burma; they suppressed the people's liberation movement in Malaya with fire and sword.
    These people use their henchmen to spill the blood of the people of Indonesia and Vietnam, who are fighting heroically for freedom and independence.
    These people issued orders for the bloodshed between Jews and Arabs in Palestine; they instigated the reign of terror against progressive forces in Iran and Turkey, in the countries of the Near East, and in the colonies and semi-colonies.
    The extreme fear of the tremendous growth of progressive forces throughout the world, the inevitable arrival of an economic crisis that threatens to shake the foundations of capitalism, and the greed that dominates the world are forcing American imperialists and their British accomplices to drive the world toward a new war at an accelerated pace. The Second World War had not yet ended when they launched a "nervous war" against the Soviet Union and the people's democracies. They stop at nothing to achieve their goals. Their arsenal includes economic oppression and diplomatic deception, the threat of atomic bombs, and the malicious propaganda of lies and slander in newspapers and on the radio.
    At the same time, military blocs are being organized, the Atlantic Pact was recently signed, and bases for future wars are being prepared in various parts of the world—from Greenland to Algiers, from Iceland to Turkey and Iran.
    The Soviet people cannot fail to pay attention to the criminal activities of the warmongers. Everyone can see that the goal of this gamble is an attack on the Soviet Union and the people's democracies, because their existence is an insurmountable obstacle to the Anglo-American imperialists' domination of the world. This obstacle also prevents the people of all countries from being turned into helpless slaves of a minority of uncrowned monarchs in America.
    Comparing the current policies of the imperialists with the facts of the recent past, the Soviet people, who are creatively working to build communism, see a striking similarity between the past and present behavior of the rulers of the capitalist world.
    Today, the imperialists are organizing aggressive blocs and intensifying the arms race. They use a set of empty words—humanitarianism, "defending world civilization" against "Bolshevik barbarism," "defending democracy" against "despotism and totalitarianism," and so on—to mask their criminal acts.
    But in 1918-1919, when they sent their troops to Russia, when they armed and instigated the White bandit gangs to slaughter the laboring people of Russia, they shouted exactly these slogans. Why did they do this? Simply because the Russian people, after suffering for many years from the suffering of war, decided and dared to plan their own destiny.
    At that time, they also attempted to strangle the young Soviet state with a noose of blockade and to prevent it from establishing economic ties with the Western world.
    They praised democracy in words, but in reality, they spilled the blood of Russian workers and peasants, aided by the reactionary royalist scum of humanity such as Kolchak, Denikin, Yudenich, and Wrangel.
    Today, they are again using the bones of the "Democrat" Kerensky as a symbol on the rostrum of anti-Soviet slander. They are gathering the remnants of the White bandits and German fascist servants who fled abroad—Banderov, Melnikov, Vlasov, and other fascist scum who escaped from the people's democracies—in order to use them for espionage, instigation, and all kinds of conspiracies.
    We have not forgotten how American and European imperialists did their best to restore Germany's military strength after the First World War.
    Isn't the open re-employment of German and Japanese war criminals, the refusal to implement democratization in those countries, and the consistent restoration of Germany and Japan's military and economic potential, regardless of the economic recovery of the victims of fascist aggression—isn't this a more intense re-enactment of the past story?
    Comparing the old tricks of those who dreamed of dominating the world yesterday with those of today shows a striking similarity.
    Isn't the claim that the Anglo-Saxon nation is superior to other nations, as expressed in America's racial discrimination against blacks and South Africa's racial discrimination against people of color, a reprint of the Nazi racial "theory"?
    Isn't the "American way of life," which is being imposed on other nations through propaganda, economic oppression, and political deception, a copy of Hitler's hated "New Order"?
    Isn't the notorious North Atlantic Defense Treaty, as drafted by its authors, a remake of the fascist "Anti-Comintern Pact"? Isn't the current "New York, London, Paris, Rome Axis" a replica of the notorious "Berlin, Rome, Tokyo Axis" that we destroyed?
    Humanity has not forgotten the outcome of the criminal adventures of those who dreamed of dominating the world yesterday. Anyone with a normal mind will immediately understand that the same causes must produce even more decisive results.
    It is difficult for us to predict which city in the world will become the second Nuremberg for those who dare to plunge humanity into a third world war. But the irrefutable logic of historical experience proves that there will be such a Nuremberg. And this time, the court of the world will not include judges who allow new Schachts to escape the revenge of justice.
    But the laboring people of those countries that have experienced the horrors of the Second World War must not forget for a moment the great price paid by the people of all countries to defeat the aggressors, and the heavy price paid by the people of capitalist countries for their governments' execution of criminal policies leading to war.
    History is on the side of the forces of human progress, who do not want a repeat of the horrors of world war. These forces are growing day by day. But we have seen the evils created and planned by the enemies of humanity—the imperialists—and we have no right to be fatalistic, hoping that history will naturally destroy the dark reactionary forces.
    The people create history. They push the old life off the stage of history and guide the new life forward. Only the united will of the people can snatch the burning torch that the warmongers—blinded by greed, fear, and malice—are holding toward the fuse of the powder keg.
    The Soviet people believe that this is the responsibility of all who want to avoid war. That is why the Soviet people and the Soviet government firmly stand on the side of peace, and why they are fighting the warmongers, removing their mask of self-proclaimed peacemakers, defenders of democracy and the rights of all nations.
    The Soviet Union's consistent peace policy does not stem from fear or weakness. The victory won in the last war has shown the world the strength of our people. The Soviet people are fighting for peace because they have a deep sense of responsibility for the fate of humanity, for its future—a future that is threatened by the enemies of peace and progress.
    Our people are particularly sharp in their protests against the warmongers because, in the past thirty years, they have experienced the destructive power of war more than any other nation in the world.
    The destruction of hundreds of ancient cities and the ashes of thousands of villages, the ashes of millions of brothers and sisters in the graveyards of Maidenek, Auschwitz, Mauthausen, and Buchenwald, and the memory of millions of brothers who died for peace and progress do not let us forget the past. They sharpen our ears and eyes. The working people of the Soviet Union have paid a great price for victory. This teaches them to cherish and defend peace, because peace brings the joy of creative labor, new milestones in culture, science, art, and literature, and the certain prospect of building communism successfully.
    In its arduous struggle against the reactionary forces of the world, our country relies on the invincible moral and political unity of the Soviet people.
    The Soviet people are stubbornly and consistently fighting for the unity of all progressive forces, because only the united strength of the supporters of peace and the building of confidence among the people of all countries can shatter the plans of the warmongers and prevent their evil conspiracies from being realized.

　　苏联人民拥护和平的斗争
    Ａ·苏尔科夫著  唐人译
    奴役各国人民、经济掠夺、战争——这就是镌刻在帝国主义阵营的统治者那罪恶集团的黑色旗帜上的字。
    这个“死亡艺术的大师”的阵营，代表屈指可数的一些寄生虫，他们习惯于奴役千百万劳动人民的血汗生活，这些劳动人民乃是资本主义被剥削的奴隶。与它对抗的是和平与进步的拥护者之广大阵营，在它的旗帜下团结了进步劳动人类的力量。
    过去三十年的全部历史过程，已经决定世界劳动人民的第一个社会主义国家——苏联，应该站在这一个阵营的前头。
    和平之伟大的保障者苏联，由于它在过去三十年间反对反动与侵略势力之一贯的斗争，已经赢得了不可争论的威望。
    从它最初握得政权的时候起，苏联政府就奉行着各民族间一贯的和平政策。布尔什维克党人在准备伟大的十月革命的时候所提出的主要口号之一，就是“为即时媾和，既不割地，又不赔款而斗争”这一个口号。
    苏维埃政权所发布的最初的命令之一就是和平法令。德国与协约国的帝国主义者对这个恢复和平的号召，却报之以对这个年青的工农国家底干涉战争，这完全不是苏联人民的过失。
    在两次世界战争之间的期间，世界的劳动人民，认清了苏联是各民族间和平的无我战士。
    在时运不佳的国际联盟里边和外边，苏联政府主张普遍裁军，以为和平的最可靠的保障。并揭露了英法对国际联盟的统治者主张先“安全”而后“裁军”的政策之帝国主义的本质。苏联政府指出，这个政策是在鼓励一个军备竞赛，并将不可避免地引起一次新的世界战争。
    苏联的舆论和政府都一再警告世界，说各资本主义政府对法西斯德意日的侵略行为与计划的“绥靖”政策，是在危及人类。
    在各强国中，只有苏联政府在意国法西斯侵略阿比西尼亚，日本侵略中国，德意法西斯侵略共和的西班牙，纳粹侵占奥国与捷克，以及希特勒侵略南斯拉夫面前，未曾以叛卖而蒙羞。
    这是第二次世界大战以前的局势。大战开始时，由于帝国主义的“柏林、罗马、东京轴心”（因其易得的“胜利”而陶醉了。）对英美迫在燃眉的威胁，迫使英美的统治者与苏联偕同作战。这个共同的斗争为盟国带来了胜利。但是当英美对他们的盟国苏联作了多次的叛卖行为以后，并在尽一切可能阻挡了法西斯占领各国的抵抗运动以后，英美资本家更进一步，在战争期间设法尽量削弱苏联；并且为了保全自己，而反对由法西斯奴役中解放出来的劳动人民底政治活动，这种政治活动在抵抗的火焰中是已经成熟了。
    然而，它们的计算没有成功，它们叛卖的阴谋也未得到所希望的结果。由于苏联肩负起反对希特勒和他的附庸们的联合力量之斗争的全部重担，在胜利的日子，使全世界都看到了苏联无穷竭的力量闪耀着世界的光辉。所有国家底千百万的劳动人民，都表示他们对苏联的感激，把它当作将各国人民从法西斯的羁轭下解放出来的恩人。
    在历史上任何时代，贪婪、恶意与恐惧之盲目的野兽的本能，都不是国际政治事件中的明智的向导的咨议。但是在二十世纪中叶的今日，那些企图恢复“神圣同盟”之黑暗的过去，并正在出发要成为世界宪兵的那些人，乃是这三个本能。
    这些人在战争仍在进行的时候，就发动了在希腊的罪恶的冒险，派遣斯科比将军的军队反对那英勇抵抗的民主战士。战后，在邱吉尔刽子手们以外，又加上了杜鲁门刽子手们。迄至今日，偕同着曹达利斯之保皇法西斯匪帮，他们仍在以希腊最优秀儿女的鲜血浸染希腊的山河。
    这些人在战争期间袖手旁观蒋介石消极抗日，积极反对中国的真正爱国者——英勇的中国共产党所领导的人民民主军队。战后，美帝国主义者又从美国纳税人榨取来的数十万万金元，花费在他们的傀儡身上，虽然这帮傀儡为中国人民所鄙视和憎恨。
    这些人鼓励印度与巴基斯坦、暹罗与缅甸的内战，他们用火与剑镇压马来亚的人民解放运动。
    这些人利用他们的小伙伴挥洒印尼与越南人民的鲜血，这些人民是在为自由与独立而英勇地战斗着。
    这些人颁下命令，叫犹太人与阿拉伯人在巴勒斯坦的流血；他们主使反对进步力量的恐怖统治，在伊朗与土耳其，在近东各国，在各殖民地与半殖民地。
    对于全世界进步力量巨大增长之非常的恐惧，势将摇撼资本主义的基础的经济危机之必然到来，以及支配世界的贪欲，正在迫使美帝国主义者和他们的英国帮凶，以加快的速度把世界驱向一次新的战争。第二次世界大战尚未终了，他们就对苏联和各人民民主国家发动了“神经战”。他们是为目的不择手段的。他们的火药库包括经济的压迫与外交的欺骗，原子弹的威胁，以及报纸与无线电的谎言与诽谤的恶毒宣传。
    同时，军事集团组织起来，最近签订了大西洋公约，并在世界各部分准备未来战争的基地——由格陵兰到阿尔及尔，由冰岛到土耳其与伊朗。
    苏联人民不能不注意战争贩子们的罪恶活动。人人看得清楚，此项赌博的目标，是对苏联与各人民民主国家的攻击；因为它们的存在，对英美帝国主义者的支配世界，是一个不可超越的障碍。这个障碍也阻挡着世界各国人民，使不致被变成美国少数无冕的君王之无能为力的奴隶。
    把帝国主义者现在的政策与最近过去的事实比较，正在为建设共产主义而创造性地工作着的苏联人民，在资本主义世界统治者的过去与现在的行为之间，看出了惊人的类似。
    今天，帝国主义者正在组织侵略集团，并加强军备竞赛。他们用人道主义，为“保卫世界文明”而反对“布尔什维克的野蛮主义”，为“保卫民主”而反对“专制与极权主义”等等一套空话来掩饰他们的犯罪行为。
    但是，一九一八年—一九年，他们曾派遣他们的军队到俄国，他们装备并鼓动白党匪帮屠杀俄国的劳动人民，那时他们所喊的正是这些口号。他们为什么这样作呢？只是因为俄国人民受了多年战争的苦难以后，决定而且敢于计划他们自己的命运。
    在当时，他们并企图以封锁的绳套扼死年青的苏维埃国家，并企图阻挡它与西方世界建立经济的联系。
    他们口头上称颂民主，实际上却挥洒俄国工人与农民的血，依以为助的是高尔查克、邓尼金、尤登尼赤、乌兰格尔这等反动的保皇的人类的浮渣。
    今天，他们在反苏诽谤的讲台上又拿出“民主党人”克伦斯基的骸骨作为标榜。他们正在搜罗逃亡国外的白党与德国法西斯仆从的残余—班德罗夫、梅尔君科夫、弗拉索夫之流，以及其他由各人民民主国家逃避出来的法西斯的浮渣，好利用他们作间牒、挑拨和形形色色的阴谋勾当。
    我们尚未忘记，美国与欧洲帝国主义者在第一次世界大战以后如何竭力恢复德国的军事实力。
    现在明目张胆起用德国与日本的战争罪犯，拒绝在各该国实行民主化，以及不顾法西斯侵略的牺牲者的经济恢复而一贯恢复德日的军事与经济潜力——这不是变本加厉地重演过去的故事吗？
    把昨日妄想支配世界的人底故辙与今日的比较一下，显示出惊人的类似。
    妄称盎格罗萨克逊民族优于其他民族，表现于美国对黑人，南非对有色民族的种族歧视，不是纳粹种族“理论”的再版吗？
    正在用宣传、经济压迫和政治欺骗强加于其他民族的“美国的生活方式”，不是人们痛恨的希特勒“新秩序”的复本吗？
    如它的著作者所拟订的臭名远扬的北大西洋防守公约，不是那法西斯的“反共公约”的重制？现在的“纽约、伦敦、巴黎、罗马轴心”不是被我们摧毁的臭名远扬的“柏林、罗马、东京轴心”的翻版吗？
    人类尚未忘记昨日妄想支配世界者之罪恶的冒险的结局。任何头脑正常的人会马上晓得，同样的原因必然要产生更具决定性的结果。
    我们难于预知世界那一个城市将成为敢于把人类抛入第三次世界大战的那些人的第二纽仑堡。但是历史经验之颠扑不破的逻辑证明将要有这样一个纽仑堡的。而这一次，世界的法庭将不包括那些让新的沙赫特们逃出正义的报复的法官们。
    但是经受过第二次世界战争惨祸的那些国家的劳动人民，必须片刻不要忘记，为战胜侵略者，各国人民所付出的重大代价，各资本主义国家的人民为他们的政府执行导向战争的罪恶政策所付出的惨重代价。
    历史是在人类进步力量一方面的，他们不想要世界战争惨祸的重演。这些力量是在逐日增长着。但是我们曾经看见人类公敌——帝国主义者——所制造与计划的罪恶，我们没有权力成为宿命论者，希望历史将自然地摧毁黑暗的反动力量。
    人民创造历史。他们把旧生活推出于历史舞台以外，引导新生活向前发展。只有人民团结的意志，能由战争贩子们——因贪婪，恐惧与恶意而盲目——的手中，夺取他们拿向火药箱导火管底点燃着的火把。
    苏联人民相信，这是一切想避免战争的人们的责任。这就是为什么苏联人民与苏联政府坚定地站在和平一方面，为什么他们正在打击战争贩子们，揭去他们自称为和平的制造者、民主与各民族权利的维护者的伪装。
    苏联一贯的和平政策不是从恐惧或软弱来的。上次战争赢得的胜利，已向世界表明了我们人民力量的坚强。苏联人民在为和平而斗争，因为他们对于人类的命运对于它的未来——这未来正遭受着和平与进步的敌人的威胁具有深刻的责任感。
    我们的人民在反对战争贩子的抗议上特别尖锐，因为在过去三十年中，他们比世界任何其他民族都更多地经验了战争的破坏力量。
    数以百计的年代久远的城镇的毁灭，与数以千计的乡村的劫灰，在梅达耐克、奥斯维辛、茂陶森与布肯瓦尔德的坟场中的数以百万计的兄弟与姊妹们的骨灰，为和平与进步而战死的数以百万计的兄弟们的记忆，不让我们忘记过去。它们使我们耳朵与眼睛敏锐起来。苏联的劳动人民已为胜利付出了巨大的牺牲。这教给他们爱护并保卫和平，因为和平带来的是创造性的劳动的欢乐、文化、科学、艺术与文学的新界碑，以及建设共产主义必定成功的远景。
    在它与世界反动力量艰苦的斗争中，我们的国家依靠苏维埃人民之不可战胜的道德的与政治的团结。
    苏联人民正在顽强地并一贯地为一切进步力量的团结而斗争，因为只有和平的拥护者团结的力量以及建立起各国人民间的信心，才能打碎战争贩子们的计划，并使他们的罪恶的阴谋不能实现。
