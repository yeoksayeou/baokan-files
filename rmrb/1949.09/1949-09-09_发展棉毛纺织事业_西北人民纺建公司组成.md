Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 8th: The Yongxing Industrial Company, the largest bureaucratic capitalist enterprise organization in the Northwest under the former Kuomintang reactionaries, has been reorganized into the Northwest People's Textile Construction Company on September 1st, upon the order of the Xi'an Military Control Commission and the People's Government, after three months of takeover and rectification. The company's future production and construction goals are to gradually restore the production of its affiliated factories to pre-war levels, and to plan the construction of new cotton and wool textile mills and dyeing and finishing factories, in order to adapt to the needs of utilizing the abundant cotton and wool raw materials of the Great Northwest to develop the textile industry. The company's current central task is to establish scientific management and reduce costs, so as to consolidate the existing foundation and seek gradual development. After the reorganization, the company temporarily administers three textile mills, one baling plant, and one flour mill. The First Textile Mill is the original Xianyang Textile Mill, the Second Textile Mill is the Caijiapo Textile Mill affiliated to the original Yongxing Company, and the Third Textile Mill is the original Guozhen Yejing Textile Mill; the baling plant is named the Northwest People's First Baling Plant, which was the original Xianyang China Baling Company; the flour mill is named the Northwest People's First Flour Mill, which was the original Caijiapo Power Alcohol Plant affiliated to the Yongxing Company. The original Yongxing Company was an enterprise organization established by the Four Big Families to monopolize the economic lifeline of the Northwest. At its peak, it held more than fifteen economic units of different natures. Before liberation, the company directly led seven units, including machinery, textiles, power alcohol, woolen textiles, flour, and coal mines; it managed the Xianyang Textile Mill and the Baling Company on behalf of others; it invested in the Chang'an Tannery, the Zhengbao News Agency, the Chongqing Yufeng Yarn Factory, and the Jiangsu Danyang Yarn Factory. At present, all of the above units, except those in the areas to be liberated, have been taken over by the People's Government.
