Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 27th - According to TASS, Budapest: After the Hungarian People's Tribunal's Chief Justice announced the verdict in the case of Hungarian traitor Rajk and his accomplices on the 24th, he read out the key points of the reasoning for the verdict, stating that the Special Committee of the People's Tribunal first pointed out that the defendants György Pálffy and Béla Korondy committed crimes while serving as soldiers (the former as a Lieutenant General, the latter as a Police Colonel). The judgment stated that, according to current laws, these two defendants should be handed over to a military tribunal.

Due to the defendants' confessions and witnesses' testimonies, the Special Committee of the People's Tribunal determined that, except for the consideration of László Brankov's role in the murder of Miloš Moic, all accusations were correct. Carefully weighing all the materials in the defendants' confessions and witnesses' testimonies, the People's Tribunal found that they completely coincided or supplemented each other, and corresponded perfectly to the events of recent years that were already known before this trial.

Regarding the murder of Moic, based on Brankov's confession and Borov's testimony, the People's Tribunal could only confirm the fact that after Brankov received the order from the Yugoslav Minister of the Interior, Ranković, to murder Moic, he introduced Borov to Mrazović, then the Yugoslav Ambassador to Budapest, and that Brankov was present when Mrazović handed his pistol to Borov for the purpose of the murder.

László Rajk, András Szalai, and Pál Justus had vilely infiltrated the revolutionary labor movement, acting as spies and informers, and had caused serious damage to the labor movement. They had continuously served the old anti-people fascist regime, acting as spies for the fascist regime, and therefore they cannot say that some past events of their criminal activities are outdated. It has been proven that Rajk returned from a French concentration camp with the help of a secret police officer (who acted according to the instructions of the Hungarian secret police). It has also been proven that Szalai, with his denunciations, helped to ensure that the political prisoners he betrayed were executed.

Based on the established facts, László Rajk, Tibor Szőnyi, András Szalai, and Pál Justus each separately and continuously, according to their own will, handed over information including extremely important state secrets to the Yugoslav and American intelligence agencies, and also partly to the French intelligence agencies, whose representatives were all covered by diplomatic positions. From these activities themselves, the purpose of these activities (which was to hand over various secrets to foreign countries) is obvious. The content of these state secrets and the positions held by the defendants determined the seriousness of the crimes they committed against national interests.

Although the information handed over by Milan Ognyenovic should also be regarded as secret, it was not of such great importance in terms of the harm to the state.

Based on the established facts, Rajk, Brankov, Szőnyi, Szalai, and Justus participated in the subversive activities carried out by imperialist forces around the world, the purpose of which was to obstruct the aspirations of progressive forces, eliminate the achievements gained by the democratic people, and prepare for a new war. The defendants cooperated as allies with the attacking force of the imperialist warmongers—the Tito anti-people fascist terrorist group in Yugoslavia. These international imperialist forces used the defendants to conduct struggles, openly or secretly, against the progress of mankind, against the achievements of Hungarian democracy and socialism, against the elimination of feudalism and the nationalization of industry and trade, against gender equality, and against the establishment of a genuine people's regime, while also preparing for bloody fascist terror against the working masses. The defendants' organization was aimed at overthrowing the democratic state system. The Special Committee of the People's Tribunal has no doubt that Rajk, Brankov, Szőnyi, Szalai, and Justus all played the same leading role.

Regarding the assassination of Moic, it has been determined that Mrazović had a decisive influence on Borov. Without this influence, Borov would not have carried out the assassination; but Brankov did not instigate Borov but only indirectly helped in the crime.

In passing the verdict, the reasons for the heavier sentences were: the length of time that Rajk, Brankov, Szőnyi, Szalai, and Justus engaged in espionage activities, and the particular seriousness of the various crimes they committed directly against the interests of the Hungarian people and all progressive humanity, and directly against the peace camp headed by the Soviet Union.

In addition to the above, the reasons for the heavier sentences were: they had vilely attempted to murder the lives of government officials who most fully represented the interests of the Hungarian people. The reasons for the heavier sentences also included that these defendants committed several crimes, each of which deserved the death penalty. The reasons for the heavier sentences also included: Rajk, Szőnyi, Szalai, and Justus had vilely abused the people's trust in them and acted jointly with foreign imperialist forces against the interests of their own people (these people trusted them, put them in high positions, and gave them enormous scope for activity). They tried to destroy the achievements of the Hungarian people's efforts, to deprive Hungary of its national and state independence, and to sell her out to imperialist forces for enslavement.

The Special Committee of the People's Tribunal believes that Rajk, Szőnyi, and Szalai have no mitigating circumstances, and the Special Committee cannot consider mitigating their sentences because the defendants confessed and repented. The Special Committee believes that although the defendants claim that they repented, they have far from proved that they are truly remorseful. As for Rajk, Szalai, and Justus' fear that Yugoslav government officials would expose their shameful history, this cannot be considered a mitigating factor either. This is not to be considered because these defendants concealed their past disloyalty and dared to usurp leadership positions in the revolutionary labor movement, thus giving the enemies of the Hungarian people the opportunity to use them against the people's interests.

The Special Committee of the People's Tribunal believes that Brankov, because he is a foreign citizen, may have some mitigating reasons. It is primarily a matter for the Yugoslav people to hold him accountable for the crime of betraying the interests of his own people. The fact that he acted under strong pressure from his government can also be used as a mitigating reason. The reason for partially mitigating Justus' sentence is that the secrets he leaked were relatively less important, and also, given that the organization he led had no connection with the Rajk group (although temporarily), it was relatively less dangerous. In view of the facts listed above, the Special Committee of the People's Tribunal cannot have any doubt about passing the death sentences on Rajk, Szőnyi, and Szalai. As for Brankov and Justus, the Special Committee considered the mitigating reasons and sentenced them to life imprisonment. The reason for a heavier sentence for Ognyenovic is that he committed the crime in an already particularly tense political situation. But the fact that he was under strong pressure from the conspirators, and that the information he handed over was of relatively less importance, should be regarded as a situation that could substantially reduce his sentence.

In conclusion, the Special Committee pointed out that the announced verdict not only conformed to the legal assessment of the charges, but also conformed to the judicial spirit of the Hungarian people. The working people and the Hungarian People's Democratic Republic, which follows the socialist road, demand that their mortal enemies be completely unable to do harm, and demand that their creative labor, national freedom, and peace be protected from the schemers and spies serving foreign imperialism. The mission of the People's Tribunal is to protect the interests of the people and protect the People's Republic. The Special Committee announced the verdict with a firm confidence, believing that it had fulfilled its duty—the duty to serve the people and protect their interests.

After announcing the verdict, the Chief Justice, in view of the prosecutors' and defense lawyers' appeals, declared that the court had decided to submit the verdict and materials related to the case of Rajk, Szőnyi, Szalai, Brankov, Justus, Ognyenovic, and others to the National Committee of the People's Tribunal for review.

　　匈牙利人民法庭首席推事宣布叛国犯判决理由要旨
    【新华社北京二十七日电】据塔斯社布达佩斯讯：二十四日匈牙利人民法庭首席推事宣布法庭对匈牙利叛国犯拉伊克及其同谋案件的判决后，即宣读判决理由的要旨称：人民法庭专门委员会首先指出：被告乔吉·巴尔赛及贝拉·科隆第系在身为军人之时（前者为陆军中将，后者为警察上校）犯罪。判决书称：根据现行法律，该两名被告须转交给军事法庭。
    由于被告的供词与证人的证言，人民法庭专门委员会便确定除考虑拉萨尔·布兰科夫在谋杀米洛施·莫伊奇上所起作用一项外，所有一切控告都是正确的。审慎地衡量被告供词及证人证言中的一切材料，人民法庭便发现它们完全互相吻合或互相补充，而且毫厘不差地符合于那些未经这次审判就已知道了的近年来的事件。
    关于莫伊奇之被杀害，根据布兰科夫的供词及博罗夫的证言，人民法庭只能确定这一事实，即布兰科夫在接获南斯拉夫内政部长兰科维奇的关于谋杀莫伊奇的命令后，就引博罗夫见当时为南斯拉夫驻布达佩斯公使的姆拉佐维奇，且当姆拉佐维奇把他底手枪交给博罗夫作谋杀之用时，布兰科夫也在场。
    拉兹洛·拉伊克、安得拉斯·萨莱及保罗·尤斯图斯曾卑鄙地潜入革命的劳工运动，作间谍与奸细，并曾予劳工运动以严重的损害。他们曾不间断地为旧的反人民的法西斯政权服务，充当法西斯政权的奸细，因此他们不能说他们罪恶活动的某些往事是过时的了。已经证明：拉伊克曾在秘密警察军官（他按照匈牙利秘密警察的训令行事）的帮助下，从法国集中营返国。也已证明：萨莱曾以他的告密，而有助于使他所出卖的政治犯受到执刑。
    根据已确定了的事实，拉兹洛·拉伊克、提波尔·佐恩尼、安得拉斯·萨莱及保罗·尤斯图斯四人，每人均各别地依照自己的意志而不间断地把包括有极重要的国家机密的情报交给南斯拉夫和美国特务机关，且也部分地交给法国特务机关，而这些特务机关的代表均以外交职位为掩护。从这些活动本身看来，这些活动的目的（这就是在于把各种秘密交给外国）是明显的。这些国家机密的内容与被告所盘据的职位，决定了他们所犯的违反国家利益的罪行的严重性。
    虽然米兰·奥格涅诺维区所交出去的情报，也要被看成是秘密的，然而从给国家的危害看来，它没有那样大的重要性。
    根据业已确定的事实，拉伊克、布兰科夫、佐恩尼、萨莱及尤斯图斯曾参与帝国主义力量在全世界所进行的颠覆活动，这一活动的目的在于阻挠进步力量的抱负，消灭民主的人民所获得的成就，并准备新战争。被告们作为盟友而与帝国主义战争贩子的攻击部队——南斯拉夫的铁托反人民法西斯恐怖主义集团——实行合作。这些国际帝国主义力量利用被告们，以公开或秘密的形式进行反对人类的进步、反对匈牙利民主与社会主义底成就、反对消灭封建主义及对工业及贸易国有化、反对男女平等、反对建立真正的人民政权的斗争，同时并准备着对付勤劳群众的血腥的法西斯恐怖。被告的组织系为了推翻民主的国家制度。人民法庭专门委员会毫不怀疑，拉伊克、布兰科夫、佐恩尼，萨莱及尤斯图斯都起了同样的领导作用。
    关于暗杀莫伊奇，已经确定：姆拉佐维奇曾予博罗夫以决定性的影响。没有这一影响，博罗夫就不会进行暗杀；但布兰科夫并未教唆博罗夫而仅仅间接地有助于犯罪。
    在通过判决时，加刑的理由是：拉伊克、布兰科夫、佐恩尼、萨莱及尤斯图斯进行的间谍活动时间之长，与他们所犯的直接反对匈牙利人民和全体进步人类底利益、直接反对以苏联为首的和平阵营的各种罪行之特别严重性。
    除上述而外，加刑的理由是：他们曾卑鄙地企图谋害那些最完全地代表着匈牙利人民利益的政府要员底生命。加型的理由还有这些被告犯了若干对他们每个人来说都应受死刑的罪行。加刑的理由还有：拉伊克、佐恩尼、萨莱及尤斯图斯曾卑鄙地滥用人民对他们的信任，与外国帝国主义势力共同行动反对他们本国的人民（这些人民是信赖他们，使他们担任高职，并给他们以巨大的活动范围的）底利益。他们力图摧毁匈牙利发动人民底努力所获得的成就，来剥夺匈牙利的民族与国家独立，把她出卖给帝国主义力量奴役。
    人民法庭专门委员会认为：拉伊克、佐恩尼与萨莱无任何减刑的理由，专门委员会不能以被告认罪与悔过而考虑减刑。专门委员会认为：被告虽力说他们悔过，但远未证明他们真诚悔悟。至于拉伊克、萨莱与尤斯图斯之怕南斯拉夫政府人士暴露他们可耻的历史一点，亦不能认为是减刑的理由。这一点无可考虑，因为这些被告既隐瞒他们过去的不忠实，同时又胆敢在革命的劳工运动中篡据领导地位，因此给予匈牙利人民之敌以利用他们来反对人民利益的机会。
    人民法庭专门委员会认为：布兰科夫，因他是外国的公民，可以有某些程度的减刑理由。要他对出卖他本国人民利益的罪行负责，首先是南斯拉夫人民的事情。他是在他的政府强硬压力之下行动，这亦可做为减刑的理由。对尤斯图斯部分减刑的理由是他所泄漏的秘密相对地较少重要性，同时，鉴于他所领导的组织与拉伊克集团没有关系（虽然是暂时的），相对地较少危险性。鉴于以上所例举的事实，人民法庭专门委员会关于通过判处拉伊克、佐恩尼与萨莱的死刑不能有任何怀疑。至于布兰科夫与尤斯图斯，专门委员会考虑到减刑的理由，处以终身惩役。对于奥格涅诺维区加刑的理由是：他在已经特别紧张的政治局势中犯的罪。但他曾处在阴谋者的强大压力之下，而且他所递交的情报是相对地较少重要性，这一事实应被视为可相当减刑的情形。
    专门委员会在结语中指出：所宣告的判决不仅符合了对罪状的法律上的评定，且符合了匈牙利人民的司法精神。劳动人民和遵循社会主义道路的匈牙利人民民主国家，要求使他们的死敌完全不能为害，要求使他们的创造性劳动、民族自由与和平受到保护而免受服务于外国帝国主义的阴谋者和间谍的侵害。人民法庭的使命便是保护人民的利益，保护人民共和国。专门委员会以一种坚决的信心宣布了判决，它相信它尽了它的职责——服务于人民及保护其利益的职责。
    首席推事于宣告判决后，鉴于检察官和辩护士提出上诉等情，乃声称法庭决定将有关拉伊克、佐恩尼、萨莱、布兰科夫、尤斯图斯、奥格涅诺维区等人一案的判决和材料呈送人民法庭国家委员会审议。
