　　The Northwest Under the Rule of the Hu-Ma Bandit Gang
　　Lao Wang
　　With the great victory of the People's Liberation Army, and the recent liberation of Lanzhou, the capital of Gansu, as the people of the Northwest are about to be completely liberated, based on my personal experience growing up in the Northwest, I want to expose the crimes of the Hu-Ma bandit gang in ruling the people of the Northwest, so that the people can settle accounts with them.
　　1. The "Two Mas"
　　Originally, there were the "Three Mas" who ran rampant in the Northwest: Ma Bufang ruled Qinghai, Ma Hongkui occupied Ningxia, and Ma Buqing was entrenched in the Hexi Corridor of Gansu. Later, when the Hu Zongnan bandit gang wanted to get involved in Xinjiang, they squeezed Ma Buqing into the Qaidam Basin of Qinghai, and his army was incorporated by Ma Bufang. Thus, only the "Two Mas" remained in the Northwest.
　　The "Two Mas" were both from Tao Sha in Gansu. Ma Hongkui's father, Ma Yunting, had pulled carriages for Empress Dowager Cixi of the Qing Dynasty. When the Eight-Nation Alliance entered Beijing, he followed Cixi in her escape, and was made a "General" for his meritorious service in escorting her, thus establishing a force in the Northwest. Ma Bufang and Ma Buqing were brothers, both from bandit backgrounds. Because they were located in the Northwest, although China went through the Xinhai Revolution, the Northern Expedition, and the War of Resistance Against Japan, many warlords and local emperors were overthrown one after another. However, the "Two Mas" maintained their rule and squatted firmly in the Northwest.
　　Under the rule of the "Two Mas," it was truly a dark and lawless place. There was no "law" to speak of, only the rulers' likes and dislikes. Military rations and land taxes were levied at will, and the lives and property of the people were not guaranteed at all. Ma Bufang had many wives in Qinghai, but that wasn't enough. If he took a fancy to a woman from any family, regardless of whether she had a husband or not, she had to marry him, and after a few days of marriage, he would "bestow" her upon his subordinates. There was once a famous dancer from the border region who went to Qinghai with his beloved wife to work. This "local emperor" seized his wife and imprisoned him for three or four years. Under the rule of the "Two Mas," young people had to serve as soldiers for the Ma family. They created a system called "father-son soldiers," using this method to force the people of the Northwest to serve as soldiers for them generation after generation. When the father died or became old, the son or grandson would take his place.
　　These two "local emperors" treated "traitors" who opposed them with extreme cruelty. They had cruel punishments such as "live skinning" and "lighting human oil lamps" (wrapping cotton around a person's body, pouring oil on it, and setting it on fire). Beheading and burying alive were simply commonplace.
　　2. The "Central Army"
　　The "Central Army" (Hu Zongnan's bandit army) in the eyes of the people of the Northwest was both a tiger and a mouse, truly hateful and annoying. Since Hu Zongnan's army squeezed out Ma Buqing in the Hexi area of Gansu, he placed his henchmen one by one in every town and village of Hexi. These bandit soldiers were mostly conscripted temporarily, and were ragged and poorly clothed, underfed, and emaciated. They had no discipline, and the bandits and thieves caught by the common people were often Hu's subordinates.
　　In Jiuquan, Gansu, a village called Jinfo Temple was inhabited by a row of Hu's bandit soldiers. One day, bandits came to the town and drove away all the cattle and sheep. The people reported it to them. These "Central Army" soldiers, riding on horseback with their guns slung behind them, went into the mountains to chase them. They hadn't gone far when the foremost one was shot off his horse. Without even seeing the shadow of the bandits, they all hurriedly ran back, but forced the people to buy a coffin and carry back the dead man, and also extorted a lot of compensation before it was over. Anxi County, outside Jiayuguan, is a place where the wind blows all year round. The sand in front of the city is piled up as high as the city wall. The people here are very poor. Due to lack of water, the harvest of crops is not very good. The vegetables they eat are scarce except for leeks. An old farmer planted a patch of leeks, and watched them in the field every day, afraid of being stolen. The "Central Army" living nearby always wanted to steal the vegetables but couldn't bring themselves to do it. Once, this gang of thieving soldiers, under the pretext of an exercise, brazenly climbed into the leek field and stayed there. The old man clearly watched the soldiers crawling and pulling up the vegetables, but was so anxious that he dared not say a word. After a while, when the "infantry exercise" of the "Central Army" ended, the leeks in the field were also gone.
　　Most hateful was in the spring of 1947, when Hu and Ma launched bandit soldier Bai Fengshan's unit to attack Qingyang City in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. Bandit leader Bai Fengshan even declared to his henchmen, "If we take Qingyang, everyone can do whatever they want." After Qingyang fell, these inhuman bandits were even more ferocious than any foreign enemy in history. In addition to looting, all the people in the city, men and women, were gathered in one place. Many women were subjected to gang rape. In order to dig out the things buried underground by the people, they dug three feet deep everywhere, causing houses to collapse and walls to fall, leaving the people homeless.
　　3. The Suffering Peasants
　　The rulers circulated a saying about how to treat the common people: "Three sentences are not as good as a stick." They believed that "the common people are walnuts to be cracked open and eaten," so in the Northwest, especially in Hexi, Gansu, whenever the ruler's officials went to the countryside, whether it was to collect grain and fodder or to apportion temporary labor, they always hung people up and beat them before talking. The beaten people, enduring the pain in their hearts, killed chickens and fried eggs to entertain the officials. The husband smiled and poured wine for the officials, while the wife, with tears in her eyes, cooked in the kitchen. Many poor farmers could not afford clothes. Generally, children under the age of ten were naked in winter. In some families, husband and wife had only one pair of cotton pants in winter. When one went out, the other squatted on the heated kang, warmed by donkey dung. Once, I went from Lanzhou to Jiuquan, and the car broke down on the road. It was a bitterly cold winter. The passengers in the car, wearing leather clothes, still felt a little cold. A group of children ran out of the village, only one of them wearing a pair of single pants, the others all naked. One of the passengers jokingly asked the child wearing the single pants, "Why are you wearing pants when the others aren't?" The child replied, "Because my family is rich." Many people laughed, but I felt extremely uncomfortable.
　　The Northwest farmers' means of transportation are very simple, especially in the Hexi Corridor of Gansu, where they generally still use the simplest and most clumsy wooden-wheeled ox carts. Every year when it comes time to pay public grain, the farmers use this only tool to transport grain. The rulers who ride on the heads of the people don't care about the lives of the people. They order the public grain of each county to be paid at the place where the commissioner's office is located. A commissioner's office governs six or seven counties. In the Northwest, the distance between cities is very long. In the Hexi area, many cities are separated by nearly a hundred to several hundred miles, and mostly desert, Gobi, and grassland. Farmers gather from all over to the commissioner's office half a month before the grain payment date, hitch up the old ox carts, load almost twice as much grain as the required amount, and set off to the place where the grain is paid. The official's measure is very large, and when measuring, they also fill it to a point. The farmers also pay in the grain they brought for their own consumption. Every winter on the roads of the Hexi Corridor, people often come across people begging for food carrying cowhides. Those are the farmers who were carrying carts full of grain to pay the public grain a month ago. Now they have eaten their own cattle, burned their own carts, and only have a cowhide left, carrying it slowly home. There are also many farmers who abandoned their land and estates and ran away because they could not afford to pay the public grain.
　　4. Blood Debt
　　Back when the Ma bandits ruled Hexi, in Jiuquan County, I personally saw more than a hundred farmers who could not pay the public grain and resisted the officials, were captured and taken to prison, and more than thirty of them, so-called "leaders of the rebellious people," were shot to death. The execution was carried out on a training ground called Dongjiaochang in Jiuquan City, and the bodies were placed in the square for "public display." One by one, the murdered peasants with their stomachs cut open and intestines flowing out, some had not been completely killed, struggling to get up, their eyes wide open, as if they had so much to say, but from their mouths, only bursts of black blood were吐着. The families of the victims, hugging the bloody and unrecognizable husbands or sons, cries and curses merged into one, and the ashes of burning paper flew everywhere.
　　I remember when the Red Army passed through the Hexi Corridor during the Long March, the Ma bandits dug a large pit, burned a fire inside, and pushed many of the comrades they had captured into it alive and burned them to death. The people of the whole country will not spare them this blood debt.
　　During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the people of Longdong and Longxi rose up because they could not bear the dark and corrupt rule of the Kuomintang bandit gang, and the endless exploitation of the landlords and corrupt officials. Most of those who participated in this movement were poor peasants, and for a time there were tens of thousands of people. They killed corrupt officials, landlords, and local bullies, and distributed the grain from the official warehouses and landlords to the poor people. This force once marched directly to the outside of Lanzhou, the capital of Gansu Province. The people of more than a dozen counties in Longshang rose up in response, but unfortunately: this vigorous movement had no correct leadership and no organization, so it was suppressed by the reactionaries in just a few months. It is said that several thousand people were killed in the fighting and later arrested and executed. Bandit leader Chiang Kai-shek even used airplanes to strafe and bomb them. Whenever the youth of Longshang think of this incident, they gnash their teeth and say, "Wait! One day we will slaughter those bastards!" (The End)

### 胡马匪帮统治下的西北角

　　胡马匪帮统治下的西北角
    老王
    随着人民解放军的伟大胜利，最近又解放了甘肃的省会兰州，在西北人民即将完全解放的今天，以我生长在西北的亲身经历，我要检举胡马匪帮在西北统治人民的罪行，让人民来清算他们。
    一、“二马”
    原先横行西北的有“三马”，马步芳统治着青海，马鸿逵占着宁夏，马步青盘据在甘肃的河西。后来胡宗南匪徒要插足新疆，便把马步青挤到青海的柴达木盆地，军队让马步芳收编了。于是西北就只剩下了个“二马”。
    “二马”都是甘肃洮沙人。马鸿逵的父亲马云亭，曾给清朝慈禧太后拉过马车，八国联军进北京时，跟着慈禧逃难，因保驾有功作了一个不小的“将军”，于是便在西北扎下了势力。马步芳和马步青是亲兄弟，都是土匪出身。因为地处西北，虽然中国经过了辛亥革命、北伐和抗日战争，许多军阀和土皇帝都先后被推翻了。但是“二马”却一直保持着他们的统治，稳稳地蹲在西北。
    在“二马”的统治下，真是暗无天日，那里谈不上什么“法律”，只有统治者的喜怒爱憎。军粮、地税随便征收，人民的生命财产，根本没有保障。马步芳在青海拥有许多太太还不算，如果在那里让他瞅上了谁家的妇女好，不管有无丈夫都必须嫁给他，结婚不几天，便“恩赐”了部下。曾经有一位边疆名舞蹈家偕着爱妻到青海去做事，这位“土皇帝”霸占了他的妻子，并且让他坐了三四年的监狱。在“二马”的统治下，青年人都要给马家当兵。他们创出了一种制度，叫做“父子兵”，用这种办法叫西北人一代给他当了兵便代代给他当兵，父亲死了或衰老了，儿子孙子去顶替。
    这两位“土皇帝”对待反对他的“叛徒”，也是极尽人间的残暴。他们有“活剥皮”、“点人油灯”（把人身上卷上棉花浇上油，点着火烧）等残忍的刑罚，砍头、活埋，简直算不了一回事。
    二、“中央军”
    西北人眼中的“中央军”（胡宗南匪军）是老虎又是老鼠，真是又可恨又可恼。胡宗南的军队自从在甘肃的河西地带挤走了马步青，便把他自己的喽＠们一批一批的摆在了河西的每个城镇和乡村里。这些匪军多半是临时强抓来的，都少衣裳短裤子的破破烂烂，吃饭吃不饱，饿的面黄饥瘦，毫无纪律，老百姓捉住的土匪小偷往往就是胡匪的部下。
    在甘肃酒泉地方，一个叫金佛寺的村镇上住着一排胡匪军，一天镇上来了土匪，把全镇上的牛羊都赶走了。老百姓报告了他们，这些“中央军”骑着马，倒背着枪，向山里去追，还没有走上好远，最前面的一个便被人打下了马，连土匪的影子也没有瞧见便都连忙的跑回来了，却强迫着老百姓买上棺材抬回死人，还索取了许多赔偿费才算了事。嘉峪关外的安西县，这地方成年吹风，城跟前的沙子，堆的和城墙一般高。这里的老百姓非常苦，庄稼因缺水，收成很不好，吃的蔬菜除韭菜一样外，别的蔬菜很少。有一个老农夫，种了一块韭菜，天天在地里看着怕人偷，住在附近的“中央军”老想偷菜总下不了手，一次，这伙贼军队假借着演习，便明目张胆的爬进了韭菜地，一直不起来，老头儿明明瞅着，军队爬着拔菜，但是干着急不敢吭声，等了一会，“中央军”的“步兵操演”结束后，地里的韭菜也光光的了。
    最可恨的，是在一九四七年的春天，胡马发动匪军白凤山部攻打陕甘宁边区的庆阳城，匪首白凤山竟向喽＠们宣称“打下了庆阳，大家可以任意所为”。庆阳陷落后，这些惨无人道的匪徒们，比历史上任何一次外族敌人还要凶暴，除抢东西外，全城的老百姓，男女各集一处，女的多遭集体奸淫；因为要挖出老百姓埋藏在地下的东西，处处刨地三尺深，弄得屋倒墙塌，老百姓无家可归。
    三、苦难的农民
    统治者们流传着一句对待老百姓的话：“三句话不如一棒子”。他们认为“老百姓是砸着吃的核桃”，所以在西北，尤其在甘肃的河西，统治者的官差每逢到乡下去，不论摧粮要草或是摊派什么临时扶役，总是将人吊起来，先打后讲。挨了打的老百姓，忍着满肚子的痛苦，杀鸡、炒鸡蛋款待官差，丈夫在官老爷面前陪笑斟酒，妻子含着眼泪，在伙房里给人家烧菜。许多贫苦的农民穿不起衣服，一般十岁以下的小孩子在冬天也光着屁股。有的人家，夫妻两个在冬天只有一条棉裤，一个出外，另一个便蹲在用驴粪烧的热炕上。一次，我从兰州到酒泉去，汽车坏在路上，正是严寒的冬天，同车的旅客，穿着皮衣，还觉着有点寒冷，村庄里跑出了一群小孩子，里面只有一个穿着一条单裤子，别的都光净着屁股，旅客中有人打趣问那穿单裤子的小孩子：“别人都不穿裤子，为什么你有裤子穿？”小孩回答说：“因为我家里有钱”。许多人都笑了，我却感到无限的难受。
    西北农民运输的工具很简单，尤其是甘肃的河西走廊地带，一般还使用着最简单最笨的木轮老牛车，每年到缴官粮的时候，农民们就用这种唯一的工具运输粮食。骑在人民头上的统治者们是不管老百姓死活的，限令各县的公粮，都要到专员公署设立的地方去缴纳。一个专员公署，管辖着六七个县城，在西北，城与城中间的距离很大，河西一带，许多城市中间差不多都隔着百里到几百里的路程，还多是沙漠戈壁和草滩。农民在缴粮日期前半个月，便从各地向专员公署集中，套上老牛车，装上比规定要缴的数目几乎要多一倍的粮食，动身到缴粮的地方去；官家的斗很大，量时还要尖着点子，农民把带着自己吃用的粮食也补缴进去。每年冬天在河西走廊的大道上，人们常会碰上一些背着牛皮讨饭的人，那就是在月前装着满车粮食去缴官粮的农民，如今他们吃了自己的牛，烧了自己的车，只剩一张牛皮，背着慢慢地走回家。还有许多农民因缴不起官粮，抛弃了自己的土地和庄园逃跑了。
    四、血债
    还在马匪统治河西的时候，在酒泉县，我就亲眼看见过，有一百多个农民因无法缴上官粮，抗拒了官差，被捉去到了监狱里，并用火枪打死了其中的三十多个所谓“叛民的领袖”，死刑是在酒泉城内的一个叫做东教场的练兵场上执行的，尸身摆在广场上“示众”。一个个肚破肠流的被杀害了的庄稼汉们，有的还没有被完全打死，挣扎着要爬起来，眼睛都睁的大大的，好象有多少话要说，但是他们的口里，却只是一阵一阵的吐着污黑的血。被难者的家属，抱着血肉模糊的丈夫或儿子，哭声和咒骂声汇成一片，烧纸的烟灰到处飞扬着。
    记得是红军长征路过河西走廊时，马匪们挖了一个大坑，里面烧着火，把许多被他们捉去的同志，都活活地推到里面烧死了，这笔血债，全国人民不会饶了他们的。
    在抗战当中，陇东陇西的老百姓因不堪国民党匪帮黑暗腐败的统治，不堪地主贪官无止境的剥削，人民起来了，参加这次运动的多数是贫苦的农民，一时竟有好几万人。杀贪官，杀地主，杀恶霸，把官仓和地主的粮食分给贫苦的人民。这支队伍曾经直打到甘肃的省会兰州城外，陇上老百姓起来响应的有十几县之多，但可惜的是：这个轰轰烈烈的运动无正确的领导，没有组织，所以仅历时数月便被反动派镇压下去了。据说这次被打死及事后被抓去处了死刑的就有好几千人，匪首蒋介石还用飞机去扫射轰炸。陇上青年每想起这件事就会切齿的说：“等着吧！总有一天会宰了狗日的！”　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（完）
