What is the “American Way of Life”?
    By Pulutesha, Translated by Zi Pei

During my several months of visiting America, I tried to figure out what ordinary Americans mean by the “American Way of Life,” a fashionable term frequently used by American political commentators and even mentioned in official diplomatic documents. However, no two explanations were the same. It seems that this "doctrine" has not yet been established. In this land of so-called "unlimited opportunities," no philosopher has dared to venture to establish it.

During the presidential election, Americans, in order to oppose Dewey's reactionary war program, staged an old film in a movie theater in the suburbs of New York. The theater was full of children. In the film, the star Chaplin and a group of bankrupt adventurers, rogue partisans, and poor people left Europe together on a ship. Charlie was persecuted on the ship and shed tears every day. But when the "Statue of Liberty" appeared on the screen, the children watching the movie immediately cheered and whistled, because they thought Chaplin's suffering was over. As in the old immigrant stories, with the appearance of the "Statue of Liberty," the "American Way of Life" unfolded before them.

Today, the United States has banned immigration from foreign countries. The main people who can now land in the United States are fascists protected by the "refugee" law. However, American propaganda still tries to vividly portray the illusion of the old immigrant stories, as if Wall Street's monopoly network has not yet extended to all continents. However, fantasy is not a sign of abundance, but a sign of poverty. The poverty that made these immigrants leave their homeland chases after them as much as before after they move to the United States. Immigrants are still looking for the "American Way of Life" behind the "Statue of Liberty." But immigration is no longer from other countries to the United States; it has become an endless migration of the American people within the country. According to statistics released by the U.S. Department of Commerce Registry last October, more than 2.3 million people have migrated from other states to California in the past eight years. Have these people found the "American Way of Life" in California?

California is not the only place that attracts workers to migrate; in fact, every state has been affected by this migration movement. Millions of people move from east to west and from west to east; from south to north and from north to south. To escape lynching and racial discrimination in the South, black people sell themselves as cheap labor to manufacturers in the North. Workers in the North, however, moved to the West in hopes of getting higher wages and working in new factories. At first glance, these non-fixed migrants do not seem to be workers. In fact, they are victims of America's unique fever—the pursuit of work. In addition, there is another kind of migration, from one profession to another. I met an aeronautical engineer who changed his career to become a typesetter, a university professor who became a bricklayer, and a lawyer who became a restaurant waiter. These millions of people will not understand the meaning of the "American Way of Life" when they can't even get food in their mouths.

My personal first experience of the "American Way of Life" was when I was about to enter the United States. At that time, they gave me an entry permit. Behind my name were the words "White Race." No diplomatic personnel can not receive this kind of entry permit. The moral insult caused by these words became more concrete as I stepped onto American soil step by step. There is no place in the world where people are subjected to so much humiliation as in the United States.

People who have never been to the United States can hardly imagine the system of discrimination against black people. This system of discrimination against black people ranges from restrictions on political rights and wages to lynching and other atrocities. Racial hatred permeates the atmosphere like suffocating poisonous fog, causing people's disgust and revulsion.

But Americans carefully preserved a place—and only this place—where racial discrimination is formally prohibited. This place is Washington, D.C., which Americans call the world's greatest democratic capital. As for the people who created this "democratic oasis in the desert," it is difficult to determine whether they suffer more from hypocrisy or from sadism. It is true that in Washington, D.C., black people can ride the same tram as white people. However, once you get to the suburbs, if you want to go to the neighboring city of Alexandria, black people must switch to a special vehicle. When I saw the signs "White Toilet" and "Colored Toilet" on the toilets of gas stations along the road around the capital of this "world's greatest democracy," I couldn't believe my eyes.

The American capital pays a special price for its "democracy." There is no theater in the capital. The National Theatre is closed because if it is not closed, black and white audiences will have to mix together.

In fact, even in Washington, D.C., there are rude acts of racial discrimination, although not as barbaric as erecting gallows in other states. Last September, the police fabricated excuses to search a private residence because black and white veterans were gathering there. The unwritten law of lower wages for black people is used in Washington as in other states, and the elevator operators in the State Department are all black people, as if to retaliate against the "no discrimination" law. White people who do not comply with racial discrimination rules will be persecuted by law and sanctioned by public opinion. Once I went to visit an American crypt, which is said to be the most beautiful place in the world. I stood in a line of ticket buyers, but the gatekeeper insisted that I stand in another line. At that time, I was a little confused. When I looked back, oh, I understood, it turned out that I was standing in the line for black people.

I have never been to the southern states. However, I don't understand why so many people believe that Americans in the North are against racial discrimination. Isn't there black residential areas everywhere in the North, aren't doormen and porters everywhere black, and aren't there racial prejudices everywhere?

Mrs. D, an American woman who has lived in the northern states for two generations, said that she supported President Roosevelt's policies and "regretted the deterioration of relations between the United States and the Soviet Union."

"Our relationship was better during the war," Mrs. D told me, "because we were allies at the time." When I talked about the increasing rampant of the terrorist murder organization the Ku Klux Klan, she also expressed anger and surprise. But when I asked her for her opinion on general racial discrimination, she quickly became "white." She said confidently: "Racial discrimination is the scourge caused by the crime of our ancestors who bought black slaves to work for them. Now we can only defend ourselves, otherwise, the physiological power of this barbaric race will turn us all black." Mrs. D was very happy that the black population in the United States was decreasing year by year due to the miserable living conditions.

Mrs. D's words, of course, do not represent those who have removed racial prejudice. She also does not represent those young "white" Americans who were arrested in Baltimore for violating racial discrimination laws in a football game. She also does not represent the Veterans Association, an organization that anyone who has fought against the Nazis can join, regardless of skin color. Mrs. D believes that the "American Way of Life" exists, but she cannot say what its meaning is.

In the speeches of Mr. Benas and most other American politicians, and in the essays in newspapers, several general formulas can often be found. They regard the phrase "American Way of Life" as the key point of their philosophy. These formulas include "equal opportunities," "free competition," "the state is not allowed to interfere in private affairs," and "self-made successful people," etc. The same illusions about the entire United States are also cultivated in the general political plan. Big capitalists boast that the United States is a "country of free people."

All these words constitute the theoretical basis of the "American Way of Life," but racial discrimination must also be added, as well as the anti-communist persecution launched by trust-run newspapers and various rogue organizations.

The propagandists of the "American Way of Life" are all dedicated to anti-communist propaganda.

One of White-Roosevelt's last supporters, died of a weak heart when the Un-American Activities Committee interrogated him—testifying in front of the infamous Thomas, said: Of course, he supports all the principles of the "American Way of Life," but he does not want them to be used by Thomas as an anti-communist tool. This statement shocked the Un-American Activities Committee, which believed that anti-communism was the foundation of the "American Way of Life." All the officials of the passport bureau and post office, and the drivers in Washington, are learning the "American Way of Life" from FBI leader Hoover!

Ordinary Americans are threatened by tear gas and police batons not only during strikes but also in daily life. During the election campaign, I personally witnessed the following scene in a Washington store. Two clerks made a bet on how many U.S. presidents were named Thomas. One of them called the Library of Congress to inquire. The library first asked for his name and address on the phone, and asked why he was inquiring about this matter. As a result, the clerk panicked, and he tremblingly asked the other clerk: "Have I done something un-American?"

Without witnessing the fierce anti-communist movement in the United States and the fantasy drama staged by the Un-American Activities Committee using millions of copies of monopoly newspapers, radio, and movies during Dewey's election campaign, the above-mentioned matter would be considered unbelievable.

The Vatican is also a loyal supporter of the "American Way of Life." This powerful reactionary fortress is always on guard. The propagandists of the "American Way of Life" have never mentioned the Vatican, but it is always behind the political stage and behind the Hollywood screen, conducting censorship and propaganda.

When the movie "Joan of Arc" was staged on Broadway, Bishop Spellman conducted anti-Soviet propaganda in St. Patrick's Church on Fifth Avenue.

Advertisements were posted everywhere, urging people to participate in the "Feast of the Assumption," praying for the "conversion of the Soviet Union" and "world peace." It would be wrong to think that the "Feast of the Assumption" is a new invention of Bishop Spellman. As the church magazine explained, the "Feast of the Assumption" was declared as early as 1917 to counter the October Socialist Revolution.

So, what exactly is the "American Way of Life"?

The "American Way of Life" is the worldview of American big monopoly capitalists. They call everything that conforms to their own interests "American" and everything that violates their interests "un-American." The "American Way of Life" is an attempt by monopoly capitalists to use it to conceal the class struggle that will destroy the capitalist system.

　　“美国生活方式”是什么
    普勒忒沙著  秭佩译
    在访美的几个月中，我曾力图搅清楚普通美国人所说的“美国生活方式”，这个为美国政论家所常用且甚至在官方外交文件中也被提及的时髦术语，到底是什么意思。但是，所得到的解释，从没有两个相同的。好象这个“学说”还没有确立。在这所谓“机会无限”的土地上，还没有一个哲学家敢于冒险来确立它。
    选举总统期间，美国人为了反对杜威的反动的战争纲领，曾经在纽约郊区一家电影院里上演了一部旧的片子。满院是儿童。片子里边，明星贾波林与一群破产的冒险家，无赖党徒和穷困的人，乘船一块离开了欧洲。查理在船上受着迫害，天天流着眼泪。但当“自由神像”出现银幕上时，看电影的孩子们立刻欢欣鼓舞地吹起口哨，因为他们想着贾波林的苦难已告结束。正如在古老的移民故事里一样，随着“自由神像”的出现，“美国生活方式”已展开在他们的面前了。
    今天，美国已经禁止外国向美国移民。现在能在美国登陆的，主要是受“难民”法保障的法西斯分子们。然而，美国的宣传仍力图把古老的移民美谈的幻景，描写得栩栩欲生，好象华尔街的垄断之网还没有伸展到世界各洲一样。可是，幻想不是富足底兆征，而是穷困底兆征。使这些移民们离开本土的贫乏，在他们迁到美国以后，和从前一样追逐着他们。移民们依旧在找寻着“自由神像”背后的“美国生活方式”。但是移民已不再是由旁的国家移到美国，它已经变成了美国人民在国内的无终止的迁徙。根据美国贸易部登记局去年十月发表的统计，八年来，共有二百三十多万人从其他各州迁至加里福尼亚州。这些人是不是在加里福尼亚州找到“美国生活方式”了呢？
    加里福尼亚州并不是唯一能吸引工人们迁入的地方，事实上每一州都受了这一迁徙运动的影响。成百万的人民从东移到西又从西移到东；从南移到北又从北移到南。为了逃避南方的私刑和种族歧视，黑人们把自己作为廉价的劳动卖给北方的制造商。北方的工人们，却为了希望得到较高的工资，迁到西方，在新工厂做工。粗略地看起来，这些没有固定工作的迁徙者好象都不是工人。其实，他们正是美国特有的热症——追寻工作——的牺牲者。除此之外，还有另一种迁徙，从一种职业转入另外一种职业。我曾遇见一个航空工程师，改行为排字工人，一个大学教员当了砖瓦匠，一个律师当了饭馆的侍者。这些成百万的人，当他们饭都弄不到嘴里的时候，他们是不会了解“美国生活方式”的意义的。
    我个人第一次体验到“美国生活方式”，是当我要进入美国的时候。当时，他们交给我一份入境证。在我的名字后面，写着“白种”这两个字。所有外交人员，没有人能不领这种入境证的。为这些字所引起的道义的侮辱，随着一步步踏上美国领土而变得更具体化了。世界上，再也没有地方象在美国一样，人们受着这么大的侮辱。
    没有到过美国的人，是很难想象歧视黑人的制度。这种歧视黑人的制度从政治权利的限制和工资的限制，直至私刑和其他暴行。种族仇恨象令人窒息的毒雾一样渗透了大气，引起人们的嫌恶与反感。
    但美国人小心地保留了一块地方——也就只有这一块地方——正式禁止种族歧视。这个地方就是美国人称之为世界上最伟大的民主首都的华盛顿城。至于创造这“沙漠中的民主绿洲”的人民，从虚伪抑或从虐待狂受到更大的痛苦，那就很难确定了。不错，在华盛顿城里边，黑人的确是可以和白人同乘一辆电车。但是，一到市郊，要往邻近的亚历山大城去，黑人就必须改乘一辆特种车了。当我在这“世界上最伟大的民主”的首都的周围，看到了路旁装油站的厕所上写着“白色人厕所”，“有色人厕所”等字样的时候，我简直不相信自己的眼睛了。
    美国首都为了它的“民主”，付出特殊的代价。首都里边是没有一个戏院。国家戏院关闭着，因为如不关闭的话，黑色观众和白色观众便要混在一起了。
    其实，即使在华盛顿城里，也有粗暴的种族歧视行为，虽然没有象其他各州那样野蛮到树起绞刑架来。去年九月，警察曾经捏造口实来搜查一所私人住宅，因为黑人退伍军人和白人退伍军人在那里聚会。黑人工资较低的不成文法，在华盛顿也与在其他各州一样采用，而国务院的开升降机的，则净是黑人，好象是要以此来报复“不许歧视”法。不遵守种族歧视规则的白种人，将受到法律的迫害和舆论的制裁。有一次我去参观一所美国的地穴，据说，这所地穴是世界上再也美不过的地方。我站入了一个买票者的行列，但守门者一定要我站到另外一行列去。当时我有点莫名其妙。及至回头一看，哦，我明白了，原来我所站的是黑人的行列。
    我不曾到过南部各州。但是，我不懂为何有这么多的人相信北部的美国人是反对种族区别的。北部不是到处都有着黑人住宅区，到处的门房掮夫都是黑人，到处都存在着种族的成见吗？
    Ｄ太太，一位美国妇人，她家在北部各州住了两代之久，她说她是拥护罗斯福总统政策，并且“因美国与苏联交恶而觉得遗憾”。
    “在战争期间我们之间的关系较好”，Ｄ太太告我说：“因为当时我们还是盟友”。当我谈起恐怖的谋杀组织三Ｋ党日益猖獗时，她也表示着愤怒和惊讶。但当我征求她对一般的种族歧视的意见时，她很快就变成“白人”了。她很自信地说：“种族歧视是购买黑奴来为他们做工的我们祖先们犯罪所引起的祸害。现在我们也只有防卫自己，不然的话，这个野蛮种族的生理的力量将要使我们都变成黑人了。”美国的黑人人口因凄惨的生活状况而逐年减少，Ｄ太太对此是很高兴的。
    Ｄ太太的话，当然不代表那些去掉了种族成见的人。她也不代表那些因在足球比赛中犯了破坏种族歧视法律在柏尔的摩被捕的美国年青“白人”。她也不代表退伍军人社，这个组织，不管皮肤的颜色如何，只要是对纳粹作过战的军人，都可以参加。Ｄ太太相信“美国的生活方式”是存在的，至于他底意义是什么，她却说不出。
    在贝纳斯先生和大部分其他美国政治家的演说中，在报纸的论文中，有几个一般的公式时常可以找到。他们把“美国的生活方式”这句话，作为他们的哲学底要点。这些公式包括着“机会均等”、“自由竞争”、“国家不许干涉私人事情”、“自己努力成功的人物”等。在政治的一般计划上，也培植着同样的关于整个美国的幻想。大资本家自夸美国是“自由人之国”。
    所有这些话构成了“美国生活方式”的理论基础，不过还必须加上种族歧视，加上托拉斯所办报纸与各种无赖组织所发动的反共迫害。
    “美国生活方式”的宣传家们，全都致力于反共宣传。”
    怀特—罗斯福的最后支持者之一，在反美委员会对他进行调查询问时，因心脏虚弱而死——在臭名昭著的汤姆斯的面前作证时说：对于“美国生活方式”底一切原则，他当然是拥护的，但他不愿它们被汤姆斯用为反共工具。这段话震撼了认为反共是“美国生活方式”底基础的反美委员会。所有的护照局和邮政局的官员们，华盛顿的汽车夫们，都正在从联邦调查局领袖虎佛那里学习“美国生活方式”呢！
    一般美国人不仅在罢工的时候，并且在日常生活中，都被催泪弹和警棍威胁着。在竞选运动当中，我在一家华盛顿的商店里亲眼看见了下面一幕情景。两个店员，打赌美国总统有几个是以汤姆斯为名。他们中间有一人就打电话向国会图书馆讯问。图书馆在电话里首先问了他的名字和住址，问他为什么要打听这件事情。这样一来，这位店员慌了，他战战兢兢地问另一位店员：“我是不是已经作了反美的事情？”
    没有目睹美国国内的激烈反共运动，与没有目睹反美委员会在杜威竞选时期利用发行百万份的垄断报纸、无线电和电影所演出的幻想剧，对于上边所说的事，是会认为不可相信的。
    梵蒂岗也是“美国生活方式”的忠实拥护者。这座强有力的反动堡垒，时时刻刻在警戒着。“美国生活方式”的宣传者没有提到过梵蒂岗，然而它总是在政治舞台的背后，在好来坞银幕的背后，进行检查，进行宣传。
    当电影片子“女救主冉达克”在百老汇路上演的时候斯泊尔曼主教在五马路的圣巴垂克教堂进行反苏宣传。
    四处贴着广告，劝人参加“圣母节”的纪念，祈祷“苏联转变”和“世界和平”。若以为“圣母节”是斯泊尔曼主教的一个新发明，那便错了。正如教堂杂志所解释的那样，“圣母节”是早在一九一七年，为对付十月社会主义革命而宣布的。
    那么，“美国生活方式”到底是什么呢？
    “美国生活方式”是美国大垄断资本家的世界观，他们把所有符合于自己利益的称为“美国的”，把所有违反他们利益的称为“反美的”。“美国生活方式”是垄断资本家企图利用它来掩蔽那使资本主义制度灭亡的阶级斗争。（译自六月十五日“争取持久和平与人民民主”）
