An utterly corrupt Chinese bureaucratic capitalist enterprise, once it fell into the hands of the people and underwent initial reform, began to flourish. In Shanghai, there are many such examples, and the China Tobacco Company is one of them.

The China Tobacco Company was formed after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War by merging four units, including the enemy's China Tobacco Co., Ltd., received by the Kuomintang bandit gang. The company has three factories, with a total of 114 machines for steaming tobacco, rolling cigarettes, and cutting tobacco (large and small), 2,000 workers, and 148 staff members. The company's production efficiency, taking the No. 1 factory, which can regularly operate 24 cigarette rolling machines, as an example, is that each machine can produce 7 cases of cigarettes (50,000 cigarettes per case) in 9 hours of work per day. If calculated based on 26 working days per month, the maximum output of 24 cigarette rolling machines can reach 4,368 cases. Such a production scale and efficiency are second only to the Yizhong, Fuxin, and Huacheng tobacco companies and are rare in China's cigarette industry.

However, during the three years under the management of the Kuomintang, the company's production not only did not develop but, on the contrary, a large amount of the company's old capital was also sucked away by the successive bloodsuckers. During the three years, the company changed its general manager four times. Each time, each person brought a group of cronies and relatives, colluding and cheating together. Therefore, under the general manager, deputy general manager, and assistant manager of the head office, there were actually four departments, three offices, and a purchasing committee. There were also so-called consultants and specialists who only received high salaries and did not do actual work, totaling 22 people. This turned the enterprise management organization into a bureaucratic institution filled with redundant personnel and inefficient. These people's purpose in the China Tobacco Company was only to make money, so purchasing raw materials, selling finished products, and disposing of waste were all good opportunities for them to engage in private fraud, corruption, and embezzlement. For example, in selling finished products, the China Tobacco Company has always adopted a distribution method, and the underwriting customers are divided into two types: local peers and out-of-town peers. However, most of the out-of-town peers are Shanghai merchants who falsely set up firms. They used bribery to obtain goods through these corrupt personnel in the company, sell them on the Shanghai market, and make huge profits in the process. This resulted in a glut of cigarettes in the Shanghai market, causing great losses to the company itself. As for the purchasing committee, it was even more corrupt. They used various methods such as delaying payments, falsely reporting prices, collecting kickbacks, and accepting substandard tobacco leaves in the procurement of tobacco leaves, paper rings, wooden boxes, and printed packaging materials to embezzle for their own benefit and make a fortune. As a result, the company's operations deteriorated day by day. The Third Factory had been shut down since it started operations for three months in early 1946, allowing the production machines to be damaged and rusted. Although the First and Second factories were still operating, the monthly total production had dropped from the highest output of 8,000 cases in October 1946 to 3,105 cases in February this year. Tobacco leaves and finished products piled up in the three warehouses rotted and deteriorated. Since April this year, the China Tobacco Company has been unable to maintain even the minimum production due to the exhaustion of funds and the lack of raw materials. Daily expenses were entirely dependent on selling one case to eat one case. By the eve of the liberation of Shanghai, the workers' wages could not be paid, and even the 2,000 cases of finished products piled up in the warehouse could not be sold because they could not afford to pay taxes. In this way, the China Tobacco Company reached the end of its rope in the hands of bureaucratic capital.

After the liberation of Shanghai, the China Tobacco Company was officially taken over by the Light Industry Department of the Shanghai Military Control Commission's Financial and Economic Takeover Committee. The takeover by the Light Industry Department was carried out under the established policy of "each according to its system, original state unchanged; top-down, complete set of acceptance; investigation and research, gradual transformation." The takeover personnel ordered the old personnel to prepare a transfer list while taking care of their lives and asking them to continue to work with peace of mind; at the same time, they went deep into understanding the specific situation of each unit of the company. During the investigation and research, it was found that senior company personnel such as assistant managers and department heads could not provide accurate figures for production costs, business profits and losses, and daily expenses. The General Affairs Department did not know where all the company's real estate was; the Accounting Department had not even cleared the accounts for January. All kinds of corrupt situations were fully exposed. It would be a big mistake if such an organization was not immediately transformed in a planned and step-by-step manner. Therefore, the Light Industry Department began to mobilize some personnel to transfer to various departments to master business and directly manage work.

The staff and workers of the China Tobacco Company bravely organized themselves to protect the factory before and after the liberation of Shanghai, kept all the important keys, and preserved the people's property. During the takeover period, they also established a temporary workers' representative meeting and elected representatives to assist in the takeover and inventory of materials. The staff and workers had long been very dissatisfied with those who engaged in private fraud, had notorious deeds, received salaries for nothing, and took go-slow actions against the company's rapid resumption of production, and they demanded that they be dealt with quickly. Obviously, if these correct demands of the staff and workers could not be met quickly, it would dampen the enthusiasm of the staff and workers and cause the government to become detached from the masses. Therefore, after careful study by the Light Industry Department, on July 15, it issued an order to dismiss 28 people, including Assistant Manager and Acting General Manager Yin Yanjun, department heads, specialists, directors, and section chiefs. Among them, ten people were ordered to provide guarantees for handling the transfer because the accounts and procedures for the business they handled were unclear. The other 18 redundant personnel who had nothing to do were given one and a half months' salary and sent away. Their positions were also taken over by military representatives, takeover personnel, and promoted old staff members who could really do things. Due to the dismissal of this group of corrupt and incompetent personnel, the righteous spirit in the company rose, the evil spirit declined, and the morale of the people was greatly boosted. In addition, as a result of the initial adjustment of the salaries of the staff and workers, the workers' production enthusiasm was greatly improved. Now, the No. 1 and No. 2 factories are operating six days a week. The output of cigarettes in June was 1,824 cases, the output of cigarettes in July was 3,420 cases, and the output of cigarettes as of August 26 has been 4,458 cases. The plan is to gradually reach a monthly output of 5,000 cases in the future. The No. 3 factory, which has been shut down for a long time, is also being planned for restoration. In terms of selling finished products, the business has gradually improved because the company's personnel have actively approached customers, investigated market conditions, and developed sales channels in other places. The actual sales in June were 2,794 cases, the actual sales in July were 2,321 cases, and the sales in August have been 2,354 cases. It is estimated that the sales will definitely increase when the moldy season is over and autumn arrives. In addition, the China Tobacco Company is currently carrying out a streamlining and economy campaign and holding staff and worker training classes, preparing to thoroughly eliminate the corrupt practices of bureaucratic enterprises from thought to action and lay a new foundation for people's enterprises.

Of course, the China Tobacco Company's transition from a dead end to a new life is only a beginning. It still has many difficulties to overcome. For example, the takeover personnel still need a learning process to become familiar with and master business and production technology; the entire production organization and personnel have not yet been comprehensively and thoroughly adjusted, and the phenomena of waste and unreasonableness still exist in the production process; in addition, due to the poor transportation, the sales of finished products are restricted, the capital turnover is difficult, and the vitality damaged in the past cannot be fully restored for a while. However, these difficulties can be gradually overcome. The major change of the China Tobacco Company from bureaucratic capital to the hands of the people determines that it, like other people's enterprises, has an infinitely bright future!　　　　　　[Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 1st]

　　改造官僚企业的一个例子
    计惜英
    一个腐败不堪的中国官僚资本的企业，一经转入人民之手，经过初步改造，便蒸蒸日上了。在上海，这样的例子很多，中华烟草公司便是其中一例。
    中华烟草公司，是抗日战争胜利后，国民党匪帮接收的敌中华烟草株式会社等四个单位合并组成。这个公司下辖工厂三座，有蒸烟、卷烟、大小切烟机等机器共一百一十四部，工人二千人，职员一百四十八人。该公司的生产效能，以经常可开动二十四部卷烟机的第一厂为例，每日开工九小时，每部机器可产烟七箱（五万支装）。如以每月开工二十六天计，二十四部卷烟机的最高产量可达四千三百六十八箱。这样的生产规模和生产效能，仅次于颐中、福新、华成三烟草公司，在中国的卷烟工业中是不可多得的。
    可是，在国民党管理的三年多时间中，该公司的生产，不但没有发展，相反地，连公司的大量老本，也被先后而来的吸血鬼们吮吸了。三年多当中，该公司曾四易总经理，每次交接，各人都带来一批裙带亲信，上下其手，共同作弊。因此，总公司在总经理、副总经理、襄理之下，居然分设四处、三室和一个购料委员会，并有只领高薪，不做实际工作的所谓顾问、专员等，共达二十二人之多，使企业管理机构变成一个冗员充塞而无效率的官僚机构。这些人在中华烟草公司的目的只是发财，所以收购原料，推销成品，处理废物，都是他们营私舞弊、贪污中饱的好机会。例如推销成品，中华烟草公司向来采取配售办法，承销客户又分本埠同行和外埠同行两种。但其中外埠同行，多半系上海商人虚设字号，他们用贿赂办法通过公司中的这批营私舞弊的人员取得配货抛售上海市场，转手之间获取巨利。这样，便形成上海市场卷烟充斥，使公司本身受到莫大的损失。至于购料委员会，则更为腐败。他们在采购烟叶、纸圈、木箱和印刷包装品方面，用延迟付款、虚报价格、收取回扣、验收劣等烟叶等种种方法，贪污自肥，大发洋财。其结果是使公司的经营日趋破落。第三工厂自一九四六年初开工三月以后，就一直停顿下来，任令生产机器损坏生锈。第一、第二两个工厂虽仍开工，但每月的生产总量，已从一九四六年十月份的最高产量八千箱，降到今年二月的三千一百零五箱。三座仓库堆放的烟叶、成品，霉烂腐坏。今年四月以来，中华烟草公司因为资金耗尽，原料不继，就连最低限度的生产都难于维持了，日常开支，全靠卖一箱吃一箱。到上海解放前夕，工人的工资已无法支付，甚至堆在仓库里的二千箱成品，因为无力纳税而不能出售。就是这样，中华烟草公司在官僚资本手中走到了山穷水尽的绝境。
    上海解放后，中华烟草公司由上海军管会财经接管委员会轻工业处正式接管。轻工业处的接管，是在“各按系统，原封不动；自上而下，整套接收；调查研究，逐步改造”的既定方针之下进行的。接管人员一面令旧人员造具移交清册，同时照顾他们的生活，要他们继续安心工作；一面就深入了解公司各单位的具体情况。在调查研究中，发现公司高级人员如襄理、处长等对于生产成本、营业盈亏、日常开支，都举不出确实的数字来。总务处不知公司所有的房地产在什么地方；会计室连一月份的帐目都没有清结，种种腐败情形，全部暴露出来。象这样的机构，如不立即着手有计划、有步骤的改造，就将犯极大的错误。所以轻工业处一开始就机动地分配一部分人员，转入各部门掌握业务，直接管理工作。
    中华烟草公司的职工，在上海解放前后，曾经英勇地组织起来进行护厂，保管了所有重要的钥匙，保全了人民的财产。接收期间，他们又成立了职工临时代表会，选出代表协助接收和清点物资。职工们对于那些营私舞弊，劣迹昭著，挂名领薪，及对于公司迅速复工生产采取怠工行动的人员，早已十分不满，纷纷要求迅速加以处理。显然，如果不能迅速满足职工们这些正确的要求，就将打击职工们的满腔热情，使政府脱离群众。因此轻工业处经过慎重研究后，于七月十五日明令裁撤襄理代总经理尹衍均以下处长、专员、主任、课长等二十八人。其中十人，因为他们经手的业务，帐目手续不清，责令交保办理移交。另外十八个无所事事的冗员，则发给一个半月薪金遣散。他们的职务亦分别由军事代表、接管人员和提拔旧职员中真正能够做事的人来代理。由于裁撤这批贪污无能的人员，公司内部正气上升，邪气下降，人心为之一振，加上初步调整职工薪资的结果，工人的生产情绪大为提高。现在一二两厂每周开工六天，六月份产烟一八二四箱，七月份产烟三四二○箱，八月份截至二十六日止已产烟四四五八箱，将来计划逐步达到月产五○○○箱；停工已久的三厂，也正在计划修复中。在推销成品方面，由于公司人员主动地去接近客户，调查市场情况，开拓外埠销路，业务也渐有起色。六月份实销二七九四箱，七月份实销二三二一箱，八月份已销出二三五四箱，估计霉季过，秋天到来，销路必然还会增加。此外，中华烟草公司最近正在进行精简节约运动，举办职工训练班，准备从思想到行动，彻底消除官僚企业的腐败作风，奠定人民企业的新基础。
    自然，中华烟草公司从绝路走到新生，现在还只是一个开端，她还有许多困难需待克服。例如，接管人员对于业务和生产技术的熟习掌握，还要一个学习的过程；整个生产机构和人员还没有作一个全面的彻底的调整，生产中间浪费和不合理的现象仍然存在；加上运输不畅，成品推销受到限制，资金周转困难，过去损伤的元气，一时还不能完全恢复。但是，这些困难无论如何是可以逐步克服的。中华烟草公司从官僚资本转到人民手中的这一重大变革，就决定了她和其他的人民企业一样，有着无限光辉的前途！　　　　　　【新华社上海一日电】
