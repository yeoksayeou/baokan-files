　　Closely Integrate with the Party Newspaper
　　Xiang Yi
    The Yanqing University branch of the Chinese Communist Party conducted a survey of its members before the summer vacation, with the survey outline mainly including two parts: how to understand the Party newspaper and how to read the Party newspaper. From the thirty-five materials collected, comrades generally valued the Party newspaper, were able to read it regularly, and regarded reading the newspaper as one of their daily tasks. In terms of daily reading time, apart from one comrade who read for three to four hours daily, eight comrades regularly spent one to two hours, and the rest generally spent half an hour to an hour. In terms of reading scope, they were generally able to read policy-related texts, Party documents, and editorials carefully, and would also not miss Marxist-Leninist papers. In terms of reading methods, although some were able to read the materials in a connected way, such as some comrades being able to connect Peng Zhen's report, Li Lisan's "May 1st" explanation (regarding labor-capital relations), and the news about Dahua Pottery Company and Liu Shaoqi's visit to Dongya Company, there were also those who were able to connect it with their own thoughts and work, such as thinking about their own meeting experience after reading the "How to Hold Meetings" article in the Beijing Liberation Daily, and thinking about their own insufficient exposure of thoughts after seeing the article "Uncovering Ideological Scars," etc. However, these are still far from enough, and mostly just associations or feelings, generally remaining passive, and unable to actively combine the materials with their own thoughts and work. Therefore, the help from reading the Party newspaper is relatively small.
    Judging from the materials, in general, everyone clearly recognizes that the Party newspaper is the propagandist of Marxist-Leninist theory and Mao Zedong Thought, and the Party's policies. They also recognize that the Party newspaper improves the cadres' class consciousness, political understanding, and guides the cadres' work principles and methods, but the recognition is not clear enough. Therefore, they cannot actively and regularly use the Party newspaper as learning material and work guidance, and cannot actively and regularly combine it with their thoughts and work. In particular, everyone's recognition of the fact that the Party newspaper is the organizer of the Party and the Party's work is extremely insufficient.
    This is the situation among Party members in a school, but from here, we can also roughly see how insufficient the understanding and application of the Party newspaper is among intellectuals who can generally use writing, among general cadres, and even among the general people, and how much it needs to be strengthened.
    Every Communist Party member, every revolutionary, must take closely linking and integrating with the Party newspaper as one of our regular tasks. In every factory, school, mine, institution, rural area... we must spread the Party newspaper more deeply to the masses and integrate it with the masses. On the one hand, we should use reading groups and other forms to educate the masses with the Party newspaper, and strengthen and promote the Party's influence more deeply and widely. On the other hand, we should strive to establish a communication organization to best reflect the lives, emotions, and demands of the masses, and then use those communications to guide the development of work and educate the masses.
    Lenin often said: "We are not good at using the little that we already have." That's right, we really need to learn to use the Party newspaper better and more perfectly!

### 和党报紧紧结合起来

　　和党报紧紧结合起来
    项伊
    中共燕京大学支部曾在暑期前对党员作过一次调查，调查提纲主要包括如何认识党报以及如何阅读党报两部分。从收回来的三十五份材料来看，同志们对党报一般说是重视的，能够经常阅读，并且把读报作为日常工作之一的。就每天阅读的时间来说，除了一位同志每天阅读达三—四小时以外，有八位同志经常在一小时到两小时之间，其余的大约都在半小时到一小时间；就阅读范围来说，一般对政策性的文字，对党的文件，对社论短论都能够比较精细地阅读，对马列主义的论文也大抵不会放过。就阅读方法来说，虽也有能把材料贯穿起来阅读，如有的同志能把彭真同志报告，把李立三同志“五一”说明（关于劳资关系）和大华窑业公司和刘少奇同志到东亚公司参观后的新闻联系起来看。也有能和思想及工作结合起来的，如读了北平解放报的“如何开会”就联想到自己开会的经验，看到“揭开思想的疮疤”一文就想到自己暴露思想的不够等。但是这些都还非常不够，而且多半只是联想或感想，大抵流于被动，而不能主动地把材料与自己的思想和工作结合起来，也因此，读党报对自己的帮助就比较小。
    从材料中来看，一般对于党报是马列主义理论和毛泽东思想，是党的政策的宣传者这一点大家是认识清楚的，对于党报是提高干部阶级觉悟，政治认识及指导干部的工作方针及方法这一点也有认识，但认识得还不够明确，因此，也就不能主动地经常地把党报作为学习材料和工作指导，不能主动地经常地和思想和工作结合起来，特别对于党报是党及党的工作的组织者这一点，大家是认识得十分不够的。
    这是一个学校中党员间的情况，但从这里，也可以大略看到，一般能运用文字的知识分子中间，一般干部中间，以至一般的人民中间，对党报的认识和对党报的运用是如何的不够，如何的需要加强了。
    每一个共产党员，每一个革命者，都必须把和党报紧紧联系结合作为我们经常的任务之一，在每一个工厂、学校、矿山、机关、农村……都必须把党报更深入地传布到群众中去，和群众结合起来。一方面，要利用读报组及其他形式，利用党报教育群众，把党的影响更深更广地加强推广。一方面，应努力建立通讯的组织，来最好地反映群众的生活和情绪要求，再用那些通讯来指导工作的开展及教育群众。
    列宁常说：“我们还不善于来利用我们已有的那一点东西。”正是这样，我们真要学习更好地更完善地来利用党报！
