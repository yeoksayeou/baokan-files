Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 4th: Honolulu dispatch: The strike of the 2,000 members of the Hawaiian dockworkers union, affiliated with the International Longshore and Warehouse Union of the American Federation of Labor (AFL), has stubbornly persisted for over 120 days. The strike began on May 1st after seven stevedoring companies refused the workers' demand for a 32-cent per hour wage increase. In order to undermine the strike, the Hawaiian legislature passed a bill on August 6th instructing the Governor of Hawaii to declare a state of emergency and hire thugs to break through the striking workers' picket lines and load and unload cargo themselves. However, due to the great anger among local laborers caused by the Hawaiian government's intervention in the strike, and due to the dockworkers' union's resolute exposure of the Hawaiian government's illegal actions, only a very small number of thugs responded to the hiring. Therefore, shipping in Hawaiian ports remains paralyzed to this day, forcing the representatives of the capitalists, who had previously resolutely refused to negotiate, to agree on August 31st to reopen negotiations with labor representatives in New York on September 7th.

During this strike, the Hawaiian dockworkers received support from the Welfare Association of the Marine and Shipbuilding Workers of America (C.I.O.), which ordered its members not to work for ships loaded and unloaded by the Hawaiian government. A conference of the Longshoremen's Union held in San Francisco also resolved to support the Hawaiian dock strike.

　　美夏威夷码头工人坚持罢工已逾四月
  　资方被迫将与工人谈判
    【新华社北平四日电】夏威夷讯：属于美国产联国际码头仓库工人工会的夏威夷码头工会二千会员的罢工，迄今已顽强地坚持了一百二十余日。罢工是在七家码头装卸公司拒绝工人关于每小时增加工资三角二分之后，于五月一日开始的。为了破坏这一罢工，夏威夷立法议会曾于八月六日通过一个议案，指令夏威夷总督宣布紧急状态，并雇佣流氓分子冲破罢工工人纠察线，自行装卸货物。但是由于夏威夷政府这一干涉罢工的行动在当地劳工中引起了巨大的愤怒，由于码头工人工会坚决揭露夏威夷政府这种违法行动，结果只有极少数流氓分子应雇。因此，夏威夷港口中的船运，迄今仍陷于瘫痪状态，从而迫使以前坚决拒绝谈判的资方代表，不得不于八月三十一日同意于九月七日在纽约与劳工代表重开谈判。
    在这次罢工中，夏威夷的码头工人获得了美国产联轮船机械工人福利协会的支援，后者曾命令其会员不得为夏威夷政府所装卸的轮船工作。在旧金山召开的码头工人工会会议，也曾决议支持夏威夷的码头罢工。
