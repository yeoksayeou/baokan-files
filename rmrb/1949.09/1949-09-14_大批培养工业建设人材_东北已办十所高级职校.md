Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 13th: To meet the needs of industrial construction in the Northeast, the Industry Department of the Northeast Administrative Committee has established ten advanced industrial vocational schools in the past two years, with 5,012 students. The schools are located in various industrial and mining areas, including the Shenyang Industrial Advanced Vocational School, Shenyang Electrical Engineering Advanced Vocational School, Shenyang Textile Advanced Vocational School, Andong Industrial Advanced Vocational School, Jilin Industrial Advanced Vocational School, Fushun Mining Advanced Vocational School, Anshan Industrial Advanced Vocational School, Benxi Industrial Advanced Vocational School, Fuxin Industrial Advanced Vocational School, and Forestry Advanced Vocational School. All schools uniformly adopt an educational policy that emphasizes both lecturing and practical training, and determine the focus of the education plan according to the needs of the local industrial bureau or mine. For example, the Fushun Mining Advanced Vocational School focuses on the study of oil quality to improve oil refining technology. Business courses account for approximately 54% to 67.3% of the total curriculum in the advanced vocational schools, with the remainder being courses in politics, Chinese language, etc. At the same time, in order to learn advanced Soviet scientific knowledge and technology, four hours of Russian are scheduled each week. All students in the schools have a high school diploma, and the duration of study is one to three years. Graduates can generally enter production departments as technicians' assistants, and those with excellent grades can become engineers' assistants. Currently, the equipment in the schools is relatively simple due to the initial establishment phase. Only schools in Anshan and Fushun can utilize on-site equipment for practical training and experiments. In the future, other local schools plan to extract necessary machines, instruments, and specimen materials from various factories and mines, without affecting production, to supply the schools for practical training and experimental applications.

　　大批培养工业建设人材
　  东北已办十所高级职校
    【新华社北平十三日电】沈阳迟到消息：为了适应东北工业建设的需要，东北行政委员会工业部两年来开办了工科高级职业学校十所，学生有五千零十二人。学校分设在各工矿地区，计有沈阳工科高级职业学校、沈阳电机高级职业学校、沈阳纺织高级职业学校、安东工科高级职业学校、吉林工科高级职业学校、抚顺矿山高级职业学校、鞍山工科高级职业学校、本溪工科高级职业学校、阜新工科高级职业学校、林务高级职业学校等。各校一律采用讲授和实习并重的教育方针，并根据所在地工业局或矿山的需要，决定教育计划的重点。如抚顺矿山高级职业学校就把重点放在对油质的学习上，以便提高炼油技术。各高级职业学校的业务课约占全部课程的百分之五十四到百分之六十七点三，其余是政治、国文等课。同时为了学习苏联先进的科学知识和技术，确定每周学习俄文四小时。各校学生都是高中毕业程度，修业年限一年到三年，毕业后一般地可以进入生产部门作技师的助手，成绩优良者且可以成为工程师的助手。目前各校的设备，由于是开初创办，大部比较简陋，仅鞍山和抚顺等地的学校，可以利用现场设备进行实习和实验。其他地方学校，今后准备在不影响生产条件下，由各厂矿抽出必要的机器、仪器和标本材料等，供给学校实习实验应用。
