Commodity Management of New Democracy Seen from Tianjin State-Owned Department Store
　　　　By Our Correspondent in Tianjin, Zhao Gang
　　　　(1) Overview of the Department Store
　　Tianjin State-Owned Department Store was established in late April of this year. The retail department is located in the building of the former "Zhongyuan Company" on Roosevelt Road, the most prosperous area in Tianjin. The organizational structure of the company includes a general manager and a deputy manager, under whom are the business department, wholesale department, production and purchasing department, recreation department, and secretarial and personnel sections. The business department handles retail business in the city, the wholesale department handles wholesale allocations inside and outside the city, and the production and purchasing department is responsible for establishing business relationships with factories and purchasing industrial products. The company deals in 3,600 kinds of goods, some of which are daily necessities suitable for workers, students, office staff, and ordinary citizens in the city, and most of which are necessities for citizens in small and medium-sized cities and the vast rural areas. About 10,000 people visit the company for shopping and sightseeing every day. The average daily retail sales are no less than 20 million yuan. Adding the sporadic wholesale amount, the daily average sales can reach 50 million yuan. This is an astonishing figure, unprecedented in the history of private department stores or shops in Tianjin.
　　　　(2) New Democratic Commodity Management Methods
　　Following the guiding principles of the New Democratic economic direction, Tianjin Department Store has achieved prosperous business. The new business direction of the company can be seen from the following aspects.
　　First, the business policy of Tianjin Department Store is based on Chairman Mao's instructions on the general policy of industry and commerce, with the purpose of supporting and developing industrial production, organizing the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, supplying daily necessities for urban workers, students, office staff, and ordinary citizens, and supplying the necessary living and production materials for citizens in the vast rural areas and small and medium-sized cities (such as kerosene, matches, alkali, white sugar, pigments, bicycle tires, paper, cloth, etc.). After the liberation of Tianjin, although private department stores and shops had some changes in commodity management compared with before liberation, the old commodity management concepts and methods still seriously existed. Most of the goods they dealt with were still needed by a small number of wealthy classes in the city, while daily necessities suitable for ordinary citizens, especially the vast rural areas, were rarely or not at all handled. The following are the sales figures of major goods of Tianjin Department Store in the past four months:
Goods　　　　　　　　　　Sales Volume
Matches　　　　　　　　　　600 cases
Pigments　　　　　　　　8,914 barrels
White Sugar　　　　　　　　6,257 jin
Bicycle Tires　　　　　　45,622 pairs
Alkali　　　　　　　　　　600 packages
Alum　　　　　　　　65,273 jin
Ink　　　　　　　　　　6,705 dozens
Pencils　　　　　　　　5,612 reams
Toothbrushes　　　　　　37,340 pieces
Soap　　　　　　　　　　2,996 cases
Newsprint　　　　　　18,912 reams
Socks　　　　　　　　5,469 dozens
Towels　　　　　　　　13,674 dozens

　　In addition to the above-mentioned main goods, the sales volume of wool yarn, sneakers, vests, undershirts, and fabrics is also considerable. According to statistics, the goods sold by the company to small and medium-sized cities and rural areas account for about 53% of the company's total sales. However, general private department stores rarely stock goods suitable for rural needs.
　　Second, in terms of commodity prices, Tianjin Department Store, based on the principle that commercial profits cannot be higher than industrial profits, adopted the method of small profits but quick turnover, and set reasonable prices appropriately according to the cost of goods. Retail prices are generally 5% lower than the market price, and wholesale prices are generally 10% lower than retail prices. By selling goods at such low prices, the department store not only achieved physical breakeven but also obtained an average profit of more than 10%.
　　Due to the company's grasp of the above policies and methods, the goods it manages have achieved rapid sales. According to statistics for four months, the total purchase amount was approximately 3,918,662,660 yuan, and the sales amount was 2,526,307,664 yuan, with sales accounting for about 80% of the total purchase amount.
　　Third, the company's approach has produced several good results. First of all, it has played a considerable role in supporting industrial production. The company has established business relationships with 91 public and private factories in Tianjin, promoting the sales of finished products of various factories through methods such as exchange, ordering, processing, and exclusive sales. In the past four months, the company has promoted industrial products worth more than 12.59 million yuan for four companies, including Dongya Woolen Mill, Zhonghua Match Factory, Yuhua Rubber Factory, and Zhenzhong Rubber Factory. It also supplied them with industrial raw materials worth more than 483 million yuan. The business department of the company has a special sales department that has established contracts with more than 70 public and private factories, requiring them to manufacture industrial products according to the company's regulations on prices, quality, etc. The company sells on their behalf, charging only a handling fee of 5% to 15% of the total sales. The company has also played a certain role in promoting the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas. According to statistics from April to the end of August, the company has allocated goods worth approximately 2,526,307,664 yuan in Renminbi to Zhangjiakou, Shijiazhuang, Baoding, Beiping, Taiyuan, Taihang, Jinnan, Jidong, Northeast, Northwest, and Central Plains areas through state-owned trading companies. Most of these goods are selling well in small and medium-sized cities and vast rural areas.
　　　　(3) Future Efforts
　　(1) Strengthen the investigation and research on the goods needed in rural areas, and supply goods in large quantities according to the actual needs of rural areas to meet the requirements of rural areas. (2) Further support industrial production, and vigorously help promote the sales of industrial products suitable for the vast rural areas through various methods. (3) According to the current abnormal phenomenon that commercial profits are higher than industrial profits, prices should be appropriately reduced in the future, which will be more conducive to industrial development and the needs of the people. (4) Standing in the leading position of state-owned enterprises, strengthen the unity with private department stores, and help them change the high-profit business thinking of "no business for three years, but eat for three years once business is done," so that they can also move towards the business aspect of small profits but quick turnover.

　　从天津国营百货公司
  　看新民主主义的商品经营
    本报驻津记者赵刚
    　　　　（一）百货公司的概况
    天津市国营百货公司成立于今年四月下旬，门市部设在天津最繁华的罗斯福路原“中原公司”的大楼里。该公司在组织机构上，设正副经理各一，下设商场部、批发部、生产采购部、游艺部及秘书、人事等科。商场部经营本市的零售业务，批发部办理市内外的批发调拨，生产采购部负责与工厂建立业务关系，采购工业品。该公司经营的货品达三千六百种，其中有一部分适合本市工人、学生、机关职员和一般市民需要的日用品，大部分是中小城市的市民和广大农村的必需品。每天往公司买货和游览者约万人，每天零售货品平均不下二千万元，加上零星批发的数额，每天平均可卖五千万元。这是个惊人的数字，在天津私营百货公司或商店来说，是历史上未曾有过的。
    　　　　（二）新民主主义的商品经营方法
    遵循着新民主主义经济方向的指导原则，天津百货公司获得了经营的兴旺与繁荣。从下列几个方面，可以看出该公司新的经营方向。
    一、天津百货公司的业务方针，是按照毛主席的工商业总方针的指示，以扶植与发展工业生产，组织城乡物资交流，供给城市工人、学生、机关职员和一般市民的日用必需品，供给广大农村和中小城市市民所必需的生活、生产资料（如煤油、火柴、碱面、红白糖、颜料、自行车内外带、纸张、布匹等等）为目的。天津解放以后，私营百货公司和百货商店在商品经营上，虽较解放以前有了一些转变，但旧的商品经营观点和方法依然严重的存在着。他们所经营的货品，绝大部分仍是城市少数富有阶级所需用的，而适合于一般市民特别是广大农村的日用品，他们很少或根本没有经营。四个月以来，天津百货公司主要货品销售数字如下：货品名　　　　　　　　推销数量火柴　　　　　　　　　　六○○箱颜料　　　　　　　　八、九一四桶白糖　　　　　　　　六、二五七斤自行车内外带　　　四五、六二二付碱面　　　　　　　　　　六○○包白矾　　　　　　　六五、二七三斤墨水　　　　　　　　六、七○五打铅笔　　　　　　　　五、六一二罗牙刷　　　　　　　三七、三四○支肥皂　　　　　　　　二、九九六箱粉连纸　　　　　　一八、九一二令袜子　　　　　　　　五、四六九打毛巾　　　　　　　一三、六七四打
    除上述几种主要货品外，毛线、球鞋、背心、汗衫、布匹等的销售量也不少。据统计，该公司销于中小城市和农村的货品约占公司总销额的百分之五十三。而一般私营百货商店，则很少备有适合农村需要的货品。
    二、在商品价格上，天津百货公司本着商业利润不能高于工业利润的原则，采取了薄利多销的办法，按照货品成本，适当订出合理价格。零售价格一般低于市场的百分之五，批发一般低于零售价格的百分之十。以这种较低价格出售货物，百货公司不但做到了实物保本，还能取得平均百分之十以上的利润。
    该公司由于掌握了上述方针与办法，其所经营的货品做到了迅速的推销。据四个月的统计，共进货额约三、九一八、六六二、六六○元，销出二、五二六、三○七、六六四元，销出占进货总额的百分之八十左右。
    三、百货公司这种作法，已经产生了若干良好的效果。首先，在扶植工业生产上起了相当的作用。该公司和津市九十一家公、私工厂建立了业务关系，通过交换、订货、加工、包销等办法，推销各厂的成品。该公司在四个月中，曾为东亚毛线工厂、中华火柴厂、钰华橡胶厂、震中橡胶厂等四家推销了约值一千二百五十九万余元的工业品。并供给了他们四亿八千三百余万元的工业原料。该公司的商场部内专设有一经销部，与七十多家公私营工厂建立了合同，使他们按照公司的价格、质量等规定制造工业品，公司代销，只抽销货总额百分之五至十五的手续费。该公司在促进城乡物资交流上也起了一定的作用。据四月至八月底统计，该公司通过国营贸易公司调拨到张家口、石家庄、保定、北平、太原、太行、冀南、冀东、东北、西北、中原等区的货品，约合人民币二、五二六、三○七、六六四元。这些货品大部分畅销于各地中小城市和广大农村。
    　　　　（三）今后努力的方向
    （一）加强农村需要货品的调查研究，根据农村实际的需要，有计划的大量供给货品，以满足农村的要求。（二）进一步扶植工业生产，凡适合广大农村所需要的工业品，通过各种办法，大力帮助推销。（三）根据目前商业利润高于工业利润的不正常现象，今后在价格上还要适当降低，更有利于工业发展和人民的需要。（四）站在国营企业的领导地位，加强和私营百货业的团结，帮助他们转变那种“三年不开张，开张吃三年”的高利润的经营思想，使他们也向着薄利多销的经营方面去作。
