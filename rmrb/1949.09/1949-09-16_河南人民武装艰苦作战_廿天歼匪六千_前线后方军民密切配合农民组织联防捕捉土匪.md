　　Henan People's Armed Forces Fight Hard
　　6,000 Bandits Eliminated in 20 Days
    Military and Civilians Closely Cooperate in Front and Rear; Farmers Organize Joint Defense to Capture Bandits
    [Hankou News] The suppression of bandits in Henan Province in August achieved great results. In twenty days (from the 1st to the 20th), according to incomplete statistics from various military sub-districts: the following bandit leaders were captured alive: Ren Taisheng, Deputy Commander of the Xi'an Pacification Headquarters' Western Henan District; Yang Chunting, Chief of Staff; Hu Junping, First Deputy Division Commander of the New Second Division; Ning Hanchen, Deputy Division Commander of the New Third Division; Xiao Wenfu, Commander of the Supplementary Regiment of the New Second Division; Huo Junfa, former Commander of the First Security Regiment of the Eleventh Administrative Office of Shanzhou; Chen Junhou, Commander and Division Commander of the Hubei-Henan-Anhui Guerrilla Forces; and Liu Yafo, Director of the Joint Defense of the pseudo-Fuyang, Linquan, and Xixian counties, and more than ten others. Two thousand four hundred and fifty-nine bandits were killed or captured, including bandit leader Liu Qi and bandit battalion commander Yang Yulin. Three thousand nine hundred and ninety-five bandits registered and surrendered, for a total of 6,454 bandits eliminated. The following were seized: 3 mortars, 3 sixty-millimeter guns, 47 light and heavy machine guns, 3,314 rifles and carbines, 16 submachine guns, more than 100 shells, and more than 50,000 rounds of various ammunition.
    In the bandit suppression operation, our troops fought hard, and the Party and government comrades in the front and rear, as well as the people of the entire region, actively assisted and cooperated. For example, when a certain battalion of a certain division of our 42nd Army cooperated with the Wenxiang Brigade to rush to Luling Pass (the border between Henan and Shaanxi), they walked 80 li of rocky mountain road. Due to the hot weather, many people suffered from heatstroke. After timely first aid, no one was left behind, and they finally completed the task of blocking the enemy. A certain regiment braved the rain to cross the river and did not rest for a day and a night. The morale of the soldiers was still very high, and they finally annihilated the enemy in the Wenyu Valley area of the Qinling Mountains. After the bandits were annihilated or defeated by us, the masses actively organized to capture fleeing bandits. For example, villages in the ancient urban area of Zheng County have organized joint defense teams to strengthen sentry posts. Militia in the Matou and Xincheng districts of Kaifeng County have organized to guard their homes, provide joint defense, report bandit activity, and capture scattered bandits. In the Shangcheng Renhe District of the Huangchuan sub-district, the masses organized night watch teams to patrol and cooperate with the troops in suppressing bandits with great success.

　　河南人民武装艰苦作战
　  廿天歼匪六千
    前线后方军民密切配合农民组织联防捕捉土匪
    【汉口讯】河南省八月份剿匪获很大成绩。二十天中（一日至二十日），据各军分区不完全统计：活捉匪首西安绥靖公署豫西区副司令官任泰升、参谋长杨春亭、新二师第一副师长胡均平、新三师副师长宁汉臣、新二师补充团团长萧文甫、前陕州十一专署保一团团长霍俊发、鄂豫皖游击司令兼师长陈钧厚、伪阜（阳）临（泉）息（县）三县联防主任刘亚佛等十余名，毙俘匪首刘七、匪营长杨玉林以下二千四百五十九名，连向我登记自新之匪三千九百九十五名，共消灭匪六千四百五十四名。缴获迫击炮三门、六○炮三门、轻重机枪四十七挺、长短枪三千三百一十四支、冲锋枪十六支、炮弹百余发，各种子弹五万余发。
    在剿匪作战中，我各部队艰苦作战，前后方党政工作同志及全区人民则积极协助配合。如我四十二军某师一营配合阌乡大队赶赴卢灵关（豫陕边境）时，走了八十里石头山路，因天气炎热，很多人中暑，经及时急救，无一人掉队，终于完成了堵击敌人的任务。某团冒雨渡河，一天一夜没有休息，战士情绪仍甚高涨，终将敌人聚歼于秦岭山区之阌峪山谷一带。土匪为我歼灭或击垮后，群众即积极组织起来捕捉流窜散匪，如郑县古城区各村已组织联防队，加强岗哨。开封县马头、新城等区民兵已组织起来，看家联防、报告匪情、捕捉散匪。潢川分区商城人和区群众组织打更队巡逻、配合部队剿匪有很大成绩。
