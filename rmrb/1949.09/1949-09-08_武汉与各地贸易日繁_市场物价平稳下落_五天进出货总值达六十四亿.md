　　Wuhan's Trade with Various Regions Flourishes
  　Market Prices Remain Stable and Decline
  　Total Value of Goods Imported and Exported Reaches 6.4 Billion in Five Days
    [Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 7th] The exchange of goods between Wuhan and various regions is becoming increasingly prosperous, and the market is stable. According to the statistics of the Jianghan Customs, the total value of goods entering and leaving the Wuhan market in mid-August was 7 million yuan, equivalent to 275 percent of that in the first ten days of the month. In the last ten days of the month, the statistics for only five days, from the 22nd to the 26th, show that the total value of goods entering and leaving reached 6.4 billion yuan. This is due to the restoration of transportation, the liberation of Hunan and Jiangxi, and the gradual development of rural work in Central China. Since August, agricultural products from various parts of Central China, such as rice, wheat, and cotton, have been continuously transported to Wuhan via the Hanshui River, the Yangtze River, and the Pinghan and Yuehan land and water transportation lines. Cloth, salt, other daily necessities, and Renminbi have also been imported into rural areas. The prices of various major items in Wuhan have been stable or steadily declining over the past month. In the week from August 22nd to 27th, the price of wheat fell by 4.4 percent compared with the previous week, cotton fell by 3 percent, cotton yarn fell by 1.5 percent, and second-grade machine rice fell by 12 percent. Cloth rose slightly by 2 percent due to the peak sales season.

　　武汉与各地贸易日繁
  　市场物价平稳下落
  　五天进出货总值达六十四亿
    【新华社汉口七日电】武汉与各地物资交流日趋畅旺，市场平稳。据江汉关的统计，八月中旬进出武汉市场的货物，总值为七十万万元，相当于上旬的百分之二百七十五；而下旬仅二十二日至二十六日五天的统计，进出货物总值即达六十四万万元。这是由于交通恢复、湘赣解放和华中农村工作逐渐展开的原故。八月以来，华中各地的农产品如谷米、小麦、棉花等，即经由汉水、长江和平汉、粤汉等水陆交通线源源运入武汉，布匹、食盐及其他日用必需品和人民币亦随之输入农村。武汉各种主要物品的价格月来即处于平稳或稳落的状态中，在八月二十二日到二十七日的一周中，小麦价格较前周下跌百分之四点四，棉花下跌百分之三，棉纱下跌百分之一点五；二道机米下跌百分之十二。布匹因到旺销季节微升百分之二。
