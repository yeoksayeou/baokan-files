　　Value-Protected Savings Are Not One-Sided Subsidies
　　Fixed Deposit Terms Cannot Be Shortened

Editor:
　　I have a few questions I would like to ask the People's Bank to answer:
　　(1) Why does value-protected fixed deposit saving have a minimum term of three months? I find this very inconvenient for depositors. Money needed after one or two months cannot be deposited, but prices often fluctuate within one or two months. I believe this rigid term reduces the effectiveness of absorbing idle funds and stabilizing prices. I suggest the minimum term be changed to one month.
　　(2) If a depositor with a value-protected deposit at your bank has an urgent need for funds, can they apply for a loan?
　　(3) How is interest calculated on such loans?　　　　　　　　　　(Zhang Cheng)

Mr. Zhang Cheng:
　　I will now answer your questions point by point:
　　1. The basic principle behind the People's Bank of China handling value-protected savings is to achieve mutual benefit for both the public and private sectors. On the one hand, it provides depositors with the benefit of maintaining the real value of their savings; on the other hand, it transfers the absorbed deposits to production and construction, assisting the government in implementing its policies. On the latter aspect, in order to facilitate the implementation of plans, it is necessary to have a longer period. Therefore, we stipulate that the shortest deposit term must be three months. If the deposit term is too short, it will be difficult to utilize the funds, and the bank providing depositors with the benefit of maintaining real value would become a one-sided subsidy, losing the meaning of mutual benefit for both the public and private sectors. Your opinion focuses more on the interests of depositors and does not understand the overall spirit of the People's Bank of China. We express our gratitude for your well-intentioned suggestion and are willing to keep it for reference, but it cannot be implemented at present.
　　2. The People's Bank of China has recently launched a loan business using value-protected savings certificates as collateral. Any depositor of value-protected savings at the People's Bank of China who has deposited for more than one month may apply to the People's Bank of China for a collateral loan using their open deposit certificate if they need funds for any of the following reasons:
　　1. Private weddings and funerals or special events, requiring a formal written certificate from the public security or registration authority.
　　2. Private illness or accidental injury, requiring a formal written certificate from a medical facility.
　　3. Private transfer away from this city due to official business, requiring a formal written certificate from their governing authority.
　　4. Unexpected events in organizations or groups, requiring a formal written certificate from their superior organization.
　　3. The interest on the above loans is calculated on a monthly basis. For value-protected certificate loans with a term of one month, the interest rate is increased by one point five li compared to the original certificate deposit interest rate, with an additional five hao for each additional month. For example, if a depositor uses a fixed deposit certificate with a three-month term as collateral for a one-month loan, the loan interest rate is four point five hao per month. If the loan term is two months, the interest rate is five li per month.
　　The People's Bank of China has detailed regulations for the above loan measures, which are available upon request.

### 折实储蓄不是片面贴补  整存整付期限不能缩短

　　折实储蓄不是片面贴补
    整存整付期限不能缩短编辑：
    有几个问题烦转人民银行回答一下：
    （一）折实储蓄整存整付如何规定三个月起码？我觉得这样对于存户很不便，一个月或两个月以后要用的钱就不能存储，但一个月或两个月中，物价往往有变动，我觉得这种呆板的定期，减低了吸收游资稳定物价的效力，我建议期限改为一个月起码。
    （二）在贵行有折实存款的存户如有急用时，是否可以请求贷款？
    （三）上项贷款利息如何计算？　　　　　　　　　　（章成）章成君：
    兹将所询各点分复于下：
    一、本部办理折实储蓄的基本精神是希望做到公私两利。一面给与存户实物保本的利益，一面将所吸收的存款转运用于生产建设，协助政府执行政策。在后一方面，为了便于运用计划的进行，便必须有较长的时间，因此我们规定最短存期要满三个月。如果存期过短，运用发生困难，那时银行给存户以保本的利益就成为片面的贴补，而失去公私两利的意义了。你所提的意见，看到存户利益上较多，而未了解本部整个精神，本部对你善意的建议表示感谢，愿意留作参考，但在目前还无法实行。
    二、折实储蓄单折质押贷款业务，本部最近已经举办，凡是本部折实储蓄存户存满一个月以上者，如因下列各项情形需款，均可用公开存款单折向本部申请质押贷款。
    １、私人婚丧特殊事故，须取得公安或登记机关正式书面证明。
    ２、私人疾病或意外伤害，须取得医疗处所正式书面证明。
    ３、私人因公调动离开本埠，须取得其管辖机关正式书面证明。
    ４、机关团体意外事故，须取得其上级机构正式书面证明。
    三、上项贷款利息，系以月息计算，折实单折贷款期限一个月者，利率比照原单折存款利率增加一厘五计算，每多一月增加五毫。例如某存户用三个月存期的整存整付存单质押贷款一个月，贷款利息是月息四厘五毫，如贷期为两个月，利息即为月息五厘。
    以上贷款办法，本部备有详章，可供索阅。
