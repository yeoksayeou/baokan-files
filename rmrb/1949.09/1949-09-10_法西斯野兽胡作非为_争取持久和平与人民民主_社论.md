Xinhua News Agency, Prague, September 9th:

　　The September 1st issue of "For a Lasting Peace, For a People's Democracy" published an editorial titled "Fascist Beasts Run Wild," the full text of which follows:

　　The Yugoslav bourgeois-nationalist Tito clique, having already taken the anti-Soviet, anti-Marxist road, has reached the inevitable result of its anti-communist fascism.

　　The Tito clique is a typical fascist spy group. No amount of empty talk about "socialist construction" can conceal this essence any longer.

　　The Soviet government's notes of August 11th, 18th, and 29th exposed and completely unmasked the Tito-Ranković clique as thoroughgoing fascists and running dogs of foreign capitalists. The Tito clique is a typical fascist spy group. People like Tito, Kardelj, Djilas, and Ranković, who use nationalism and social demagoguery at home to deceive the people, while colluding with Anglo-American imperialism, can only be direct running dogs and agents of the imperialist countries. On this point, as the Soviet government's note of August 11th states, the fact that this or that strong rope connects the Yugoslav government, or key figures within it, with the camp of foreign capitalism, is like a terrible indictment.

　　Lenin said: If you catch a liberal, you've found a despot. If we use Lenin's words in another, similar sense, we can say: If you catch a Yugoslav bourgeois nationalist, you've found a secret agent of foreign capitalists.

　　The Tito clique is pursuing a policy at home of turning Yugoslavia into a satellite of foreign capital, abolishing the people's democratic order, and establishing a fascist, anti-democratic, anti-communist rule using Bonapartist methods.

　　Such an anti-people, anti-communist rule can only be maintained through military-police terror. It is therefore no accident that Yugoslavia has now become a military camp. When the guerrilla war against the German aggressors was at its peak, Tito claimed to have 300,000 armed troops. Today, when there is no war against foreign enemies, there are no less than 800,000 in the armed forces and police alone, and this number does not include the armed secret police and "civilian" police. It is this military-police apparatus that supports the Yugoslav Tito clique.

　　The criminal bourgeois-nationalist Tito-Ranković clique has destroyed the Yugoslav Communist Party, and has killed, imprisoned, and expelled from the party all those who support friendship with the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, and all those who advocate friendship between Yugoslav communists and fraternal communist parties. As a result, the Yugoslav party is no longer a communist party. It has become an auxiliary force of the police apparatus, obeying the orders of police chief Ranković. The Yugoslav Communist Party—is an American political party.

　　In economic policy, the Tito clique has severed friendly economic relations with the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, and has brought the country to the brink of economic disaster. The state-owned sector is no longer public property. State capitalism dominates in industry, and private capital is tightening its grip in the cities and especially in the countryside.

　　All of this serves the purpose of wantonly exploiting the working class and the peasantry. The working class of Yugoslavia has never had such an unfortunate life.

　　In the countryside, rich peasants wield unlimited power over poor and middle peasants. In a speech in Skopje, Tito declared that what determines who is a rich peasant is not the economic status of this or that rural resident. According to Tito's definition, anyone who does not support the bourgeois-nationalist police regime is a "rich peasant."

　　Now the people of Yugoslavia call Tito "Tito-ler"; only Hitler's most despicable anti-Soviet policies can be compared to those of the Tito clique.

　　This is the result of the domestic policies pursued by the Tito clique. The restoration of capitalism in Yugoslavia is accompanied by shameless demagoguery, claiming that all of this is building socialism (if you will), and so on. The social demagoguery of the Titoites is the same in content as the demagoguery carried out by Hitler. It is therefore no accident that the people of Yugoslavia now call Tito "Tito-ler."

　　The foreign policy pursued by the Tito-Ranković clique is an example of the most odious and despicable anti-Soviet policy, and only Hitler's anti-Soviet policy can be compared to it. The leaders of the Yugoslav government have even gone so far as to condemn the Soviet government for pursuing a policy of instigating war. It seems that the instigator of war is the socialist Soviet Union, and not American imperialism. This is the shameless and degenerate state of Tito and Kardelj. In order to incite hatred towards the Soviet Union among the Yugoslav people, the Yugoslav fascists, like the German fascists, are arresting Soviet citizens residing in Yugoslavia, subjecting them to horrific torture, and fabricating various provocative stories in an attempt to prove to the Yugoslav people that the Soviet Union is "sabotaging" Yugoslavia. The fact that these citizens are willing to be friendly to the Soviet Union and express their approval of the Cominform's famous resolution on the situation of the Yugoslav Communist Party is used as an excuse to arrest and humiliate them.

　　Therefore, just like the plight of the Yugoslav people, Soviet citizens are also arrested and punished simply because they express democratic views. The Soviet note justly points out that now, only in fascist Greece under Tsaldaris and fascist Spain under Franco are people persecuted for their democratic views. Only in these countries is the Cominform resolution regarded as a "criminal document." It is no accident that the Tito-Ranković clique pursues this kind of policy in Yugoslavia, because this clique is no different from Tsaldaris and Franco in its hatred of communism, and because it has established a fascist regime in Yugoslavia. After the German fascists, no one has shown as much hostility to the international communist movement as the Yugoslav fascists. Indeed, the shamelessness of the Yugoslav fascists is even greater than that of the German fascists. The German fascists never attempted to attack any communist party, while the Tito clique attempted to weave a net to provoke various communist parties. Not long ago, the Tito gang tirelessly slandered the glorious Chinese Communist Party, spreading rumors that the CCP supported Yugoslav bourgeois nationalists. But the relentless counterattack given by the CCP to the Yugoslav fascists shattered this despicable provocation. Today, the Yugoslav newspapers seem to have completely lost their "love" for the struggle of the Chinese people.

　　The fact that Yugoslav fascists are daily denouncing the Communist Parties of Italy, France and other countries, and giving all kinds of assistance to the anti-communist police of Šerba and Moša, shows their hatred for the heroic struggle of the Communist Parties of other countries. The most despicable act of treachery by the Yugoslav fascists is the secret murder of the heroic fighters of the Greek Democratic Army. The harm done to the Greek people by the Yugoslav fascists Tito and Ranković gang is even greater than that caused by the Turkish looters. At the critical moment of the Greek guerrilla struggle, the Yugoslav fascists opened the border to the Greek fascists, while according to Tito and Ranković, they were "sealing the border" to the Greek guerrillas.

　　After breaking with the Communist Parties of the world and the socialist countries, headed by the Soviet Union, the Tito-Ranković clique has made new friends in the capitalist countries, headed by the United States and Britain. It is an obvious fact that the Tito clique is engaged in a struggle against the Communist Parties of the world and the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union, but has not waged a struggle against the government of any capitalist country. The Tito clique only has some unfinished private "business" with the governments of capitalist countries, and has no major political differences with any capitalist country.

　　The Yugoslav government is engaged in stupid attempts to "refute" the Soviet notes. It is again raising the noisy protests against the so-called unjust accusations against the Tito clique.

　　What is the point of making such a clamor in Yugoslavia that the Soviet notes are "unfair" when the newspapers of the world—both communist and bourgeois—all acknowledge that these accusations are just and are indeed facts. The fraternal communist parties know from their own experience the harm that the Yugoslav fascists—the despicable traitors of the socialist camp—are doing to the struggle against the bourgeoisie and the warmongers.

　　The bourgeois governments are well aware of this, because the Yugoslav fascists are helping them to carry out anti-Soviet activities, and are helping the warmongers and Anglo-American imperialists to carry out the struggle against the democratic socialist camp.

　　The working class and laboring people of Yugoslavia will have the strength to put an end to the criminal activities of the fascist Tito clique, and this struggle is strengthening.

　　The working class does not forgive oppressors or those who betray the interests of their people. The working class of Yugoslavia, the laboring people of Yugoslavia, will have the strength to put an end to the criminal activities of the fascist Tito-Ranković clique, and the struggle against the rule of the Tito clique is strengthening, which is an undeniable fact. Ranković himself can no longer hide this fact. The various trials that have become commonplace throughout Yugoslavia and the barbarous sentences imposed by Ranković's executioners clearly show this fact. This is evident from the reports in the Yugoslav newspapers, especially the local newspapers. The workers are not fulfilling the plan. They are leaving the factories and mines to go to the countryside. The peasants are resisting being forced into the mines and factories. The increasing number of people fleeing the country to escape police persecution, and the letters sent from Yugoslavia describing the incredible situation of the laboring people and the reign of terror by the police, provide proof that this resistance is growing. The overcrowded concentration camps and prisons clearly show this. Every day, hundreds and thousands of Yugoslav patriotic men and women are thrown into concentration camps and prisons by Ranković's police. No amount of empty talk about "socialist construction" can conceal the fascist nature of the Tito clique.

　　The workers of Yugoslavia and all true patriots, the true communists still within the Yugoslav party, are re-establishing the Yugoslav Communist Party, loyal to Marxism-Leninism, loyal to proletarian internationalism.

　　Throughout the country, in all the republics, in factories, in the countryside, many underground communist organizations are active. They are mastering the art of underground work and the skills of avoiding Ranković's police dogs. These organizations are steadily growing in number and size.

　　The new communist party and all the patriots of Yugoslavia now being established have the indivisible brotherly sympathy of the international proletariat, the communist parties of all countries, and all those who support democracy and socialism. The communists of Yugoslavia can rest assured that in their glorious and heroic struggle to return Yugoslavia to the camp of socialism and democracy, they have the full support of all fraternal communist parties.

　　The fascist beasts of the Tito-Ranković clique, who have completely run wild, are bound to perish.

　　法西斯野兽胡作非为
  　“争取持久和平与人民民主”社论
    【新华社布拉格九日电】九月一日出版的“争取持久和平与人民民主”，以“法西斯野兽胡作非为”为题发表社论，全文如下：
    已经采取了反苏、反马克思主义道路的南斯拉夫资产阶级——民族主义铁托集团，业已达到其反共法西斯主义的必然的结果。
    铁托集团是一个典型的法西斯奸细集团，一切关于“社会主义建设”的侈谈，再也隐瞒不住这一本质。
    苏联政府八月十一、十八和二十九日的照会揭露了而且完全揭穿了铁托——兰科维奇集团系彻头彻尾的法西斯分子和外国资本家的走狗。铁托集团是一个典型的法西斯奸细集团。象铁托、卡德尔、德热拉斯和兰科维奇之流，他们在国内利用民族主义和社会武断宣传来欺骗人民，同时则勾结英美帝国主义，这些人只能是帝国主义国家的直接走狗和代理人。在这一点上，如苏联政府八月十一日的照会中所说的，这一种或那一种强韧绳索将南斯拉夫政府或这个政府的要人和外国资本主义阵营连系起来，就很象一个可怕的起诉状。
    列宁说过：如果捉住一个自由主义者，那你就找到了一个专制主义者。如果用另外同一意思的词句来说列宁的话，我们就可以讲：如果捉住南斯拉夫资产阶级民族主义者，那你就找到了外国资本家的秘密代理人。
    铁托集团在国内奉行着把南斯拉夫变成外国资本的卫星国的政策，废除了人民民主的秩序，并且用着波那帕脱的方法，建立了法西斯的、反民主的、反共的统治。
    这样一种反人民、反共的统治只有借军事——警察恐怖行动才能维持得住。所以南斯拉夫现在已变成军营，并非偶然。当反对德国侵略者的游击战达于最高峰时，铁托宣称有三十万武装部队。今天，当并无对外国敌人的战争的时候，仅仅是武装部队和警察就有不下八十万人，这一数字并不包括武装的秘密警察和“民事”警察。支持南斯拉夫铁托集团的便是这种军事——警察机构。
    罪恶的资产阶级民族主义的铁托——兰科维奇集团，已破灭了南斯拉夫共产党，已把一切拥护对苏联和人民民主国家友好的人们，一切主张南斯拉夫共产党人与兄弟共产党间友好的人们，加以杀害、投入监狱和开除出党。其结果是南斯拉夫党已不再成为一个共产党。它已成为听从警察头子兰科维奇命令的、警察机构的辅助队。南斯拉夫共产党——是一个美国的政党。
    在经济政策方面，铁托集团断绝了与苏联和人民民主国家的友好经济关系，已把国家带到经济大灾难的边缘。国有部分已不再是公共财产了。国家资本主义在工业中占着优势，私人资本在加紧其在城市而且特别是其在农村中的钳子。
    这一切都服务于肆行剥削工人阶级和农民的目的。南斯拉夫的工人阶级未曾有过此种不幸的生活。
    在农村里，富农掌握对贫农和中农的无限制的权力。铁托在斯科普里的一次演说中声称：决定谁是一个富农的不是这一个或那一个农村居民的经济地位。根据铁托的定义，任何一个不拥护资产阶级民族主义警察政权的人就是“富农”。
    现在南斯拉夫的人民把铁托称作铁特勒；铁托集团的最卑劣的反苏政策只有希特勒才能与之比拟。
    这就是铁托集团所奉行的内政政策的结果。南斯拉夫的恢复资本主义，是与无耻的武断宣传相伴随的，即这一切都说成是在建设社会主义（假如你愿意这样说的话）等等之类。铁托分子的社会武断宣传，在内容上，与希特勒所进行的武断宣传是一样的。因此，绝非偶然，现在南斯拉夫的人民把铁托称作铁特勒。
    铁托、兰科维奇集团所奉行的外交政策是最可嫌恶的、最卑劣的反苏政策的例子，且只有希特勒的反苏政策才能与之比拟。南斯拉夫政府的领袖甚至到了谴责苏联政府遵循发动战争的政策的地步。似乎战争的挑拨者是社会主义的苏联，而不是美国帝国主义。这便是铁托和卡德尔堕落的寡廉鲜耻的情形。为了在南斯拉夫人民中煽动对苏联的憎恨，南斯拉夫法西斯如德国法西斯所作的一样，正逮捕侨居南斯拉夫的苏联公民，对他们加以可怖的拷打，并捏造各种挑衅性的故事，企图向南斯拉夫人民证明苏联在“暗害”南斯拉夫。这些公民愿意南苏友好，并表示赞成共产党情报局会议关于南斯拉夫共产党情况的著名的决议，这一事实被利用为逮捕和污辱他们的口实。
    因此，正如南斯拉夫人民的处境一样，苏联公民也是仅仅因为他们表示了民主的见解而被捕和受刑。苏联照会公正地指出，现在，只有在曹达利斯统治下的法西斯希腊和佛朗哥统治下的法西斯西班牙，人民才因为他们有民主的见解而受迫害。唯有在这些国家，才把情报局的决议看作“犯罪的文件”。铁托、兰科维奇集团在南斯拉夫奉行这一类政策并不是偶然的，因为这一集团在其仇恨共产主义方面，与曹达利斯和佛朗哥毫无差别，而且因为在南斯拉夫建立了法西斯的统治。在德国法西斯之后，没有任何人表现过象南斯拉夫法西斯分子那样敌视国际共产主义运动。的确，南斯拉夫法西斯分子的无耻，更甚于德国法西斯。德国法西斯从没有企图对任何一个共产党加以攻击，而铁托集团则试图编织一个向各个共产党挑衅的罗网。不久之前，铁托匪帮便曾孜孜不倦地诽谤光荣的中国共产党，散布谣言，说中共支持南斯拉夫资产阶级民族主义分子。但是中共所给予南斯拉夫法西斯分子的无情反击，粉碎了这个卑鄙的挑衅。今天，南斯拉夫的报纸似乎完全失却了它对中国人民斗争的“爱情”了。
    南斯拉夫法西斯分子，每天都在斥责意大利、法国和其他国家的共产党，并且给正在进行反共的谢尔巴和莫许的警察以种种帮助，这一事实表明了他们对于其他国家共产党的英勇斗争所抱的仇恨。南斯拉夫法西斯分子最卑鄙的背信弃义行为或者是对希腊民主军英勇战士们的暗中谋害。南斯拉夫法西斯铁托、兰科维奇匪帮对于希腊人民的危害，甚至比较土耳其掳掠者所造成的危害也是有过之无不及。在希腊游击队斗争的紧急关头，南斯拉夫法西斯分子把边境开放给希腊法西斯，而按铁托和兰科维奇的说法，他们是对希腊游击队“封锁边境”。
    铁托、兰科维奇集团与全世界共产党和各社会主义国家破裂之后，已在以美英为首的各资本主义国家中结交了新的朋友。铁托集团从事于反对全世界共产党，反对以苏联为首的社会主义国家的斗争，但却没有进行斗争去反对任何一个资本主义国家的政府，这是一个明显的事实。铁托集团与资本主义国家的政府仅仅有某些未了的私人“事务”，而与任何一个资本主义国家都没有任何重要的政治的分歧。
    南斯拉夫政府正在进行着“反驳”苏联照会的蠢笨的企图。再次提出对于所谓对铁托集团作不公正责难的喧嚣的抗议。
    当全世界的报章——共产党的和资产阶级的——莫不承认这些斥责为正当而且是确系事实的时候，在南斯拉夫作这种苏联照会“不公”的喧嚷有什么用处。各兄弟共产党从自身的经验知道南斯拉夫法西斯分子——社会主义阵营的可鄙的叛徒——对于反资产阶级、反战争贩子斗争的害处。
    各资产阶级的政府是深知这一点的，因为南斯拉夫法西斯分子正在帮助他们进行反苏活动，帮助战争贩子和英美帝国主义者进行反对民主的社会主义阵营的斗争。
    南斯拉夫工人阶级和劳动人民将有力量结束掉法西斯铁托集团的罪恶活动，这一斗争正在加强。
    工人阶级是不宽恕压迫者或叛卖他们人民的利益的那种人的。南斯拉夫工人阶级、南斯拉夫劳动人民将有力量来结束掉法西斯铁托、兰科维奇集团的罪恶活动，反对铁托集团统治的斗争正在加强，这是一个无可辩驳的事实。兰科维奇自己也再不能隐讳这一事实。在整个南斯拉夫已司空见惯的种种审判和兰科维奇刽子手们所强行的野蛮的判决，明显地表明了这一事实。从南斯拉夫报章，尤其是地方报纸报道上看来，这一点是明显的。工人们没有在履行计划。他们离开工厂和矿山到乡村去。农民反抗强制送入矿山和工厂。由于被警察追捕而逃亡出国的人们越来越多，这些人和自南斯拉夫寄出来的描写劳动人民的无法置信的情况和恐怖警察统治的信件，提供了这一抵抗正在增长的证明。集中营和监狱拥挤不堪，明显地表明了这一点。每天都有成百成千的南斯拉夫爱国志士被兰科维奇的警察投入集中营和监狱。一切关于“社会主义建设”的侈谈，再也隐瞒不住铁托集团的法西斯的本质。
    南斯拉夫的工人和一切真正的爱国分子，仍在南斯拉夫党内的真正共产主义者，已在重新建立忠于马克思列宁主义，忠于无产阶级国际主义的南斯拉夫共产党。
    在全国各地，在所有的共和国，在工厂，在农村，许多地下的共产党组织正在活动。他们正在掌握地下工作的艺术和避开兰科维奇的警犬的技巧。这些组织在数量上和人数上都在稳步地增长着。
    现在正在南斯拉夫建立中的新的共产党和南斯拉夫一切爱国分子，是有着国际无产阶级，各国共产党和一切拥护民主与社会主义的人们的不可分的兄弟般的同情的。南斯拉夫的共产主义者尽可以放心，在他们的使南斯拉夫重返社会主义与民主阵营的光荣英勇的斗争中，他们是有着一切兄弟共产党的充分支持的。
    已经完全胡作非为的铁托、兰科维奇集团的法西斯野兽，是必然要灭亡的。
