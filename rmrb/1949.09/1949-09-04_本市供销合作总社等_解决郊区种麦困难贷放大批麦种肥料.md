[Beijing News] The Ping Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative and the Cooperative Bank are lending and allocating wheat seeds and fertilizers to solve the difficulties of wheat planting for suburban farmers. In the Ping suburban area, due to excessive rainfall and the flooding of the Yongding River this year, 179 villages in eight districts, with more than 237,000 mu of farmland, have suffered from waterlogging and significant losses. To this end, the Beijing Municipal People's Government Suburban Work Committee, the Beijing Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative, the Cooperative Bank and other units held meetings to discuss solutions. It was decided that the Cooperative Bank would lend 200,000 jin of wheat seeds and 500,000 jin of fertilizer (manure) to each district in Ping suburban area. The Supply and Marketing Cooperative would also allocate 400,000 jin of wheat seeds to each district for use by poor farmers. The Supply and Marketing Cooperative recently transported 350,000 jin of wheat seeds from the Pinghan Line and Baoding area, which were distributed to various suburban areas for allocation starting yesterday (3rd).

The principle of the Cooperative Bank's loan for wheat seeds this time is to provide loans to poor farmers, some lower-middle peasants, and families of revolutionary martyrs, soldiers, and cadres in the severely affected areas of suburban Beijing who have suffered disasters and lack wheat seeds after engaging in wheat planting. The procedures for lending wheat seeds are as follows: the production committee of each district is responsible for the investigation, the borrowers themselves submit a production plan, and after review and decision, they fill out a promissory note and go to the grain storage designated by the bank to receive the wheat seeds. The loan period is stipulated to be no more than ten months (after the wheat harvest next year), with a monthly interest rate of six per cent, and the interest rate is calculated in kind. The bank also encourages the masses to adopt the method of borrowing in whole and repaying in parts or repaying in advance. The principles and procedures for lending fertilizer are roughly the same as those for lending wheat seeds, except that the fertilizer lent is converted into the number of jin of agricultural products for future repayment. The Cooperative Bank is transporting wheat seeds and fertilizers to various districts and will soon begin processing loans.

  　解决郊区种麦困难贷放大批麦种肥料
    【本市讯】平市供销合作总社与合作银行贷放、调剂麦种、肥料，解决郊区农民种麦困难。平市郊区，由于今年雨水过多和永定河水暴涨，在八个区中有一百七十九个村子，二十三万七千余亩农田已受到涝灾之患，损失不小。为此，北平市人民政府郊区工作委员会、北平市供销合作总社、合作银行等单位曾集会研讨解决办法，决定合作银行向平郊各区贷放麦种二十万斤、肥料（粪）五十万斤；合作总社也向各区调剂麦种四十万斤，以供给贫苦农民使用。合作总社近自平汉线、保定一带运到麦种三十五万斤，已于昨（三）日起分配各郊区进行调剂。
    合作银行此次办理贷麦种的原则是：在北平郊区受灾较重的地区内，对曾从事种麦而受灾没有麦种的贫苦农民、一部分下中农和烈、军、干属予以贷放。贷放麦种的手续是：由各区生产委员会负责调查，由贷户自己提出生产计划，并在审核决定后填写借据，到银行指定的存粮处领取麦种。贷放期限规定最长不超过十个月（过明年麦收以后），月息六厘，利率一律按实物计算。并鼓励群众采用整借零还或提前归还办法。贷肥的原则和手续大致和贷麦种相同，只是将所贷出的肥料折成农产品斤数。以便将来付还。合作银行正将麦种和肥料运赴各区，即可开始着手办理贷放。
