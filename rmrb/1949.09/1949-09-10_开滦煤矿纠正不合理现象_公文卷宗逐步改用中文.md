Kailuan Coal Mine Corrects Unreasonable Phenomena
　　Official Documents and Archives Gradually Switch to Chinese
　　[From Our Tangshan Correspondent] For decades, Chinese characters, which were "illegal" at the Kailuan Coal Mine, are about to become the common language for the mine's official documents and archives. This change was decided at the Kailuan Provisional Employee Representative Conference held on August 29th, and was agreed upon by Zhang Han, director of the General Labor Union Preparatory Committee, with Kailuan General Manager Yu Mingde and Pélia (a Briton) on August 31st. Zhang Han said: The Kailuan Mine is located on Chinese soil, and its main business is with Chinese people. Of the 54,000 employees in the mine, all are Chinese except for twenty-odd Britons. It is extremely unreasonable and hinders production efficiency not to conduct business in Chinese and to make the majority of Chinese people accommodate the very few Britons. Pélia proposed the establishment of a committee to oversee this reform. Both parties agreed to gradually implement the reform based on the nature of the work and actual needs.

　　开滦煤矿纠正不合理现象
  　公文卷宗逐步改用中文
    【本报唐山讯】几十年来在开滦煤矿“不合法”的中国文字，即将成为该矿公文卷宗的通用文字。这一改变，是八月二十九日召开的开滦临时职工代表会所决议，由总工会筹委主任章汉于上月三十一日与开滦总经理余明德、裴利亚（英人）所商定的。章汉说：开滦矿开设在中国土地上，其主要业务是和中国人来往，矿中五万四千余职工为中国人，英国人只有二十几个，不以中国文字行事，让大多数中国人迁就极少数英国人是极不合理并妨碍生产效率的。裴利亚提议成立一委员会，主持是项改革。双方议定根据工作性质与实际需要逐步实行改革。
