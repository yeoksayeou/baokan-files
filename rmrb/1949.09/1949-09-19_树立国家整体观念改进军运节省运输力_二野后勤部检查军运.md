　　Establish a National Overall Perspective, Improve Military Transport, and Save Transportation Capacity
  　The Second Field Army Logistics Department Inspects Military Transport
    【Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 18th】In order to improve military transport, save national transportation capacity, and facilitate the exchange of materials, the Logistics and Transportation Department of the People's Liberation Army Second Field Army convened its subordinate units on the 8th of this month to inspect and summarize the military transport work of the past half month. According to the inspection, all units have initially established a national overall perspective and are implementing the military transport system relatively strictly. For example, when troops travel by train or ship, they first fill out an application form, which is carefully reviewed by the Transportation Department, and a travel or ship verification form is issued. Only then can the troops travel by the designated number of vehicles or ships. Many units are also actively trying to save transportation capacity on their own initiative. For example, a certain ordnance depot requested ten train cars, but by automatically improving loading methods, they saved four train cars. In half a month, the units saved a total of ninety-seven train cars, which not only saved more than 42.09 million yuan in freight, but also greatly facilitated the exchange of materials in various regions.
    However, during this period, many wasteful phenomena were also discovered. The main problem is that some units and military transport personnel are not good at using and managing modern transportation tools, and there is a bureaucratic style of work, without careful calculation and inspection. For example, a certain unit hired a boat to transport coal to a certain place, but failed to investigate in advance, with the result that the boat could not dock and unload the coal, occupying the boat for more than half a month, so that only 9 million yuan worth of coal cost tens of millions of yuan in freight, and the boat could not be transported for more than half a month. There were also cases where the ship arrived at the dock, but the materials to be loaded and transported had not yet arrived, and the station had already allocated the train cars, but the shipping troops had not yet arrived at the station. All of this wasted a great deal of manpower and materials. Secondly, some cadres do not consider the problem from the overall interests of the country, such as only caring about requesting more vehicles and ships, and arbitrarily wasting transportation capacity. On one occasion, a ship that could accommodate two thousand people only carried more than seven hundred people.
    The summary of the meeting pointed out that in order to overcome the above shortcomings and improve military transport, all units must strengthen their study of military transport operations, understand the characteristics and usage methods of various transportation tools, strictly implement the system, and conduct serious inspections. Troops traveling by train or ship must have strict organizational work, such as checking the location of boarding and disembarking, and assigning special personnel to direct boarding and disembarking to avoid confusion and wasted time. Enhance the sense of political responsibility of the Transportation Department's staff, clearly recognize that all transportation tools are state property, and save transportation capacity for the country as much as possible.

### 树立国家整体观念改进军运节省运输力　二野后勤部检查军运

　　树立国家整体观念改进军运节省运输力
  　二野后勤部检查军运
    【新华社南京十八日电】人民解放军第二野战军后勤运输部为改进军运，节省国家运输力，以便利物资交流，特于本月八日召集所属各单位，检查和总结最近半个月来的军运工作。根据检查，各单位都已经初步树立了国家整体观念和比较严格地执行了军运制度。如部队乘车或乘船，都首先填写申请表，经运输部仔细核定，发出乘车或乘船核定表，然后部队才按核定数量乘用车船。不少单位并自动积极地设法节省运输力。如某军械处要了十个车皮，但因自动改进装载办法，结果节省了四个车皮。半月中各单位共节省车皮九十七个，这不仅节省了四千二百零九万余元运费，而且大大地便利了各地物资的交流。
    但是，在此期间，也发现了不少浪费现象。主要的是有些单位和负责军运人员还不善于运用和管理现代化的交通工具，存在着官僚主义作风，不进行周密的计算和检查。如某单位雇船运煤到某地，未事先调查，结果船不能靠岸，无法卸煤，把船占用半个多月，以致仅仅值九百万元的煤炭，竟花费数千万元的运费，并使该船半个多月不能航运。也有的船到了码头，但要装载运走的物资尚未到达，车站已把车皮配好，而托运部队还没到站，凡此种种浪费人力物力很大。其次，某些干部不从国家整体利益出发来考虑问题，如只顾多要车、船，任意浪费运输力。有一次有一艘能容两千人的轮船，却只载了七百余人。
    会议的总结中指出：为克服上述缺点，改进军运，今后各单位必须加强军运业务学习，了解各种交通工具的特点和使用方法；严格执行制度，认真进行检查。乘车乘船部队要有严密的组织工作，如查看上车上船地点，专人指挥上下，以免混乱和浪费时间。提高运输部工作人员的政治责任心，明确认识一切运输工具都是国家的财产，尽量替国家节省运输力。
