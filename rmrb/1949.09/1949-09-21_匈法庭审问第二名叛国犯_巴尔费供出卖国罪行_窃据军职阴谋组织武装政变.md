Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, September 17th: Today, the special committee of the Budapest People's Court trying the traitor Rajk and his accomplices, after the judge, prosecutor, and defense attorneys stated they had no further questions for the defendant Rajk, began questioning the second defendant, former Hungarian Lieutenant General and Inspector General, György Bárféi.

In answering questions posed by the chief magistrate, the defendant Bárféi pleaded guilty and admitted that the charges against him were correct.

This spy and Hungarian traitor, who directly led the preparations for the armed overthrow of the Hungarian democratic government and made plans to assassinate Hungarian national leaders, stated in his confession: He had served in the Horthy army with the rank of lieutenant, and due to his wife's origin, he left the army in 1939. As he confessed, he had always believed that fascist Germany would win. But later, when Germany's defeat was obvious, he hoped that Hungary would be occupied by American and British troops. He said this was consistent with his political interests. But events developed in another direction. The Soviet army liberated the Hungarian people. Bárféi said: This was inconsistent with my political interests, and I tried to seek a position for myself in the new democratic system, but not to faithfully serve the new democratic system, but to wage a struggle to realize my goals from the superior position of a responsible post. I hoped the situation was temporary, and after the coup, I would be able to obtain a higher position.

Pretending to be a democrat persecuted under the Horthy regime (ostensibly excluded from the Horthy army due to political beliefs), Bárféi used the support of those relevant imperialist spies to begin climbing the ladder of service.

	Preventing Workers from Joining the Army
	Deliberately Recruiting Trotskyites

In 1945, the defendant established contact with Rajk, because it was determined that their views were the same, they both hated the working class, they were enemies of socialism, they adopted a hostile attitude towards the Soviet Union, and they were prepared to do everything in their power to overthrow the existing system in Hungary. The defendant said: Since I became a general in 1946, Rajk began to talk to me in a completely frank manner. At the end of 1946 and the beginning of 1947, we had prepared for effective action, the ultimate goal of which was to put us in power. We planned to use the army and the police and, to this end, use our official positions to carry out a coup. We consciously and systematically prepared for an armed coup. I prevented workers from joining the army in every way, and whenever possible, I removed those who were already in the army. In three years, due to my activities, not a single worker was able to be appointed to any more or less important position in the army. On the contrary, I achieved the appointment of several Horthy elements, nationalists, and Trotskyites to important positions in the army, such as Nímisz, Korondi, and Földi. I meticulously carried out chauvinistic ideological education in the army.

The defendant continued: I deliberately promoted a peaceful "transition to socialism" without class struggle, and taught people that it was not the Party that must lead the country, but, as had been done in Yugoslavia, the People's Front must lead the country. I praised Tito and the Yugoslav regime in every way. In the army, I used the fact that I was the leader of the army's Party organization (which I tried to weaken in every way) to try to make myself a de facto dictator.

The defendant said: At the end of 1947, Rajk told me that he was disbanding the Party organization in the police force. Colonel Ložić, the Yugoslav military attaché in Hungary, advised me to carry out the same activities in the army, and I began to prepare for this. The defendant continued that by the beginning of 1948, he had managed to establish a mass organization in the army, composed of officers, which actually replaced the Party organization.

The defendant went on to describe how he used the position of commander of the border guards (which he also held) to instigate provocative border incidents. He forbade all Hungarian, Czechoslovak, and Romanian farmers who had land on both sides of the border from crossing the border. He admitted that he did this in an attempt to stir up hatred for Hungary among Czechoslovak and Romanian farmers and to turn Hungarian farmers against the democratic regime. Under various pretexts, he managed to leave the Hungarian border virtually unguarded, so that the people Bárféi and his accomplices needed could cross the border at any time.

Bárféi testified that, at the request of Colonel Žokel (replacing Ložić), the Yugoslav military attaché in Hungary, he managed to get Titoists to send propaganda attacking the Cominform resolution, the Communist Party, and workers' parties across the border.

The defendant stated: I pursued two goals. First, I tried to make it impossible for the Hungarian army to be used to defend the interests of the Hungarian people from imperialist conspiracies. Second, I tried to put the army entirely under our influence.

Stealing Military and Political Intelligence to Supply the Tito Clique

The defendant stated that in the summer of 1947, Rajk visited and we both agreed that we must seize power by all means, even through an armed coup. He said that we could expect help from the Yugoslav leaders, with whom he had long-standing connections. When Rajk returned from Yugoslavia, he told me about his talks with Ranković, who not only approved of our activities but also gave us new instructions. Rajk said that the only way was an armed coup, and Tito and the United States would help us to accomplish it. Bárféi said: It was at this time that the Yugoslav military attaché Ložić told him that Yugoslavia would establish increasingly close ties with the United States, and Hungary must do the same. Ložić told Bárféi that Hungary was lagging behind in this regard, and an armed coup could still change this situation. Bárféi testified that the defendant Rajk also told him about the contents of Rajk's conversation with Ranković during a hunting trip near the Kélebia train station. The defendant said: He also knew about the secret meeting between Rajk and Ranković at a hunting ground near Bács, near the Hungarian border.

The defendant said: During this meeting, as far as I know, Ranković expressed dissatisfaction with our slowness and stipulated that an armed coup be held in the spring of 1949; Ranković's instructions to Rajk were also obtained by me from the same Ranković through Colonel Žokel.

The rebel Bárféi said: Those who were prepared to hold an armed coup had planned to issue a declaration after the coup talking about friendship towards the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, while also foreshadowing that Hungary would gradually break away from the peaceful democratic camp and turn to the imperialist camp.

The defendant testified: He had systematically provided Brankov (who he knew was the representative of the Yugoslav intelligence agency in Hungary) with secret intelligence about the Hungarian military and political situation.

Brankov had introduced Bárféi to the newly arrived Yugoslav military attaché Colonel Ložić, who told Brankov that he (Bárféi) had a high position in Yugoslavia. After that, Bárféi gave his intelligence reports to the new Yugoslav military attaché in Hungary, Colonel Ložić.

Formulating Plans for Armed Rebellion and Conspiring to Assassinate Rákosi and Others

In October 1947, after learning from Ložić that a partisan congress was to be held in Rome, the defendant, in execution of his assigned task, with the help of Rajk, managed to attend the congress as a representative of the Hungarian partisans, with whom he had no connection whatsoever. At this congress, as pre-arranged, Bárféi met with Yugoslav Colonel Neđeljković, who, on Tito's orders, told the defendant about Tito's plan and gave him new instructions. In his testimony in court, Bárféi briefly described Tito's plan, which the defendant Rajk had already spoken about yesterday.

Bárféi stated: The preparations for the coup were under the overall command of Rajk, and I was responsible for the military preparations. I told Neđeljković that I agreed with this plan. I told Rajk about the meeting, and he told me that he already knew about it.

The defendant detailed how he had ensured that the car carrying Ranković to meet Rajk could secretly cross the border. He mentioned that he had met with Rajk, who gave him Ranković's instructions to immediately arrest Rákosi, Farkas, and Gerő during the military coup, and to kill them "if they resisted." Bárféi stated: In the plan I formulated, this was the most important task. Korondi was to organize three squads to prepare to arrest or assassinate Rákosi, Farkas, and Gerő at night. Rajk said: This should be done on the day they are all in Budapest. I told this to Korondi, and he told me that he had former gendarmes under him, and it would be appropriate to use them to carry out this purpose.

Bárféi testified: He also knew that the Yugoslav government had promised to aid the conspirators.

Sending Nímisz to Moscow to Engage in Espionage in the Soviet Union

The defendant stated: Through Rajk and Žokel, I received instructions from Ranković to draw up a plan for an armed coup. I carried out this task in November and December 1948. I intended to use ten battalions to carry out the coup, which would occupy the key points of the capital and the working-class districts, where we might encounter active resistance. Bárféi stated: Because the Hungarian Workers' Party began a purge (half a sentence is unclear - translator) which hindered the progress of the work, the conspirators could not determine the date of the armed coup, and only in March 1949 did Rajk decide to hold the coup between the end of May and June 1949.

Bárféi claimed: I drew up a specific plan and marked the targets to be occupied on a map of Budapest.

Bárféi kept this plan and the marked map for two months, and burned them after he learned of Rajk's arrest.

Bárféi testified: He had successfully sent Nímisz to Moscow in 1948 to serve as a military attaché, so that the latter could engage in espionage activities in the Soviet Union. Nímisz had contact with Yugoslav spies in Hungary, and in Moscow, he maintained these contacts with the intelligence agencies of the Tito clique. After the publication of the Cominform resolution, the Yugoslav military attaché in Hungary, Žokel, in a conversation with Bárféi, emphasized the increasing role of Nímisz and advised the defendant that Nímisz must now contact the Yugoslav ambassador to Moscow, Mrazović, directly.

The defendant stated: After finding an excuse, I summoned Nímisz to Budapest and informed him of this matter. Afterwards, Nímisz reported to me from Moscow that he had established contact with Mrazović.

The defendant stated in conclusion to his testimony: Colonel Žokel had told him that the armed coup in Hungary was part of a large plan drawn up by the United States, the next target of which was Poland.

The defendant continued, in answering the prosecutor's questions, that he had learned from Ložić and Žokel that the Yugoslav government was conducting espionage and subversive activities not only in Hungary but also in all other people's democratic countries. In answering another question raised by the prosecutor, Bárféi admitted that the instruction to assassinate Rákosi, Farkas, and Gerő "if they resisted" was given to him in such a way that he clearly understood that the point was to murder these leaders of the Hungarian state no matter what.

In answering another question from the prosecutor, the defendant Bárféi confirmed that he himself had participated in the activities of foreign intelligence agencies at the very time he was directing the military-political department of the Hungarian Ministry of Defense (whose task was to expose foreign spies).

The interrogation of the defendant Bárféi ended here.

After an intermission, the court began to question the defendant Brankov.

　　匈法庭审问第二名叛国犯
  　巴尔费供出卖国罪行
    窃据军职阴谋组织武装政变
    【新华社讯】据塔斯社布达佩斯十七日电：今日上午，布达佩斯人民法庭审判叛国犯拉伊克及其同谋犯的专门委员会，在法官、检察官和辩护士说他们已没有什么问题讯问被告拉伊克了之后，便着手审问第二名被告——前匈陆军中将、总监乔治·巴尔费。
    在答复首席推事所提出的问题时，被告巴尔费业已服罪，并承认对他的控告是正确的。
    这个曾直接领导武装推翻匈牙利民主政府的准备工作、并作出谋杀匈牙利国家领袖计划的间谍与匈牙利叛徒，在他的供词中说道：他曾以中尉的官阶服务于霍尔梯军队，而且由于他妻子的原籍，他在一九三九年脱离了军队。象他所供认的，他曾始终相信法西斯德国会赢得胜利。但后来当德国的败北已属明显时，他即指望匈牙利由美国及英国的军队占领。他说，这是与他的政治利益相一致的。但是事变却朝着另一条道路发展。苏军解放了匈牙利人民。巴尔费说：这是与我的政治利益不一致的，我便试图在新的民主制度中为我自己谋求一职位，但这不是为了忠诚地服务于新的民主制度，而是为了进行斗争，以便从负责任职位的优越地位来实现我的目的。我曾希望情势是暂时性的，而在政变以后，我就会能够获得更高的职位。
    装作霍尔梯政权下受迫害的民主人士（表面上因政治信仰而被排除于霍尔梯军队之外），巴尔费便利用那些有关的帝国主义间谍的支持，开始爬上了服务的阶梯。
    阻止工人参加军队
    蓄意引用托洛斯基分子
    一九四五年，被告与拉伊克建立了联系，因为已确定他们的观点相同，他们都仇恨工人阶级，他们是社会主义的敌人，他们对苏联采取敌对的态度，并准备竭尽他们权力所及的一切，推翻匈牙利现存的制度。被告说：自一九四六年我成为将军以后，拉伊克便开始以完全坦率的态度和我谈话。一九四六年底与一九四七年初，我们已为进行有效行动作了准备，其最终目的便是使我们当权。我们计划用军队与警察并为此利用我们的官职来举行政变。我们有意识地、有系统地作了武装政变的准备。我以各种方法阻止工人参加军队，并且凡是可能的时候我便除掉那些已在军队中的工人。三年之中，由于我的活动，没有任何一个工人能够得到任命充当军队中任何多多少少重要的职位。相反地，我却达成了使若干霍尔梯分子、民族主义分子和托洛斯基分子任军队的要职，这些人中譬如就有：尼米斯、科隆第、佛尔迪等人，我处心积虑地在军队中进行沙文主义精神的教育工作。
    被告继续说：我深思熟虑地宣传不经过阶级斗争而和平地“过渡到社会主义”，并向人们说教，不是党必须领导国家，而是如在南斯拉夫所已进行的，是人民阵线必须领导国家。我以一切方法极口颂扬铁托与南斯拉夫政权。在军队里，我利用我是军队党组织（我力求以一切方法削弱它）的领袖这一情况，试图使我自己成为实际上的独裁者。
    被告说：在一九四七年末，拉伊克告诉我，他正在解散警察队伍里党的组织。南斯拉夫驻匈牙利武官洛齐奇上校劝告我在军队里进行同样的活动，我便开始作这种准备。被告继称，到了一九四八年初，他已设法使一种群众组织在军队中建立起来，该组织由军官组成且实际上代替了党的组织。
    被告继描述他如何利用边防军指挥官（他同时担任此职）职位，来策动挑衅性的边疆事件。他禁止一切在边界两面都有土地的匈牙利、捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚的农民越过边界。他承认，他这样做是企图在捷克斯洛伐克和罗马尼亚农民当中激起仇恨匈牙利的情绪，并使匈牙利农民反对民主政权。在种种借口下，他设法使匈牙利边界实际上不设警卫，这样一来巴尔费和他的同谋者所需要的人就在任何时候都可以越过边界了。
    巴尔费供称，他应南斯拉夫驻匈牙利武官佐凯尔上校（代替洛齐奇）之请求，设法使铁托分子能够把攻击情报局决议、共产党和工人党的宣传品送过边界。
    被告称：我追求两个目的，第一，我力图使匈牙利军队不可能被用来保卫匈牙利人民的利益免受帝国主义阴谋侵害。第二，我力图把军队完全置于我们的影响之下。
    窃取军政情报供给铁托集团
    被告称，一九四七年夏，拉伊克来访，我们俩都同意必须用一切手段来夺取政权，即令通过武装政变也必须夺取政权。他说，我们可以期望南斯拉夫领袖的帮助，他已和他们有长时期的联系。当拉伊克自南斯拉夫回国之后，他就告诉我他和兰科维奇的会谈情形，兰科维奇不仅赞同我们的活动，并且给我们新的训令，拉伊克说，唯一的途径是武装政变，而铁托以及美国会帮助我们来把它完成。巴尔费说：就在这时南斯拉夫武官洛齐奇告诉他，南斯拉夫将与美国建立起日益密切的联系，且匈牙利也必须这样做。洛齐奇对巴尔费说：匈牙利在这方面落了伍，而武装政变却仍然能够改变这种情势。巴尔费供称，被告拉伊克也告诉了他拉伊克与兰科维奇在凯利比亚火车站附近打猎会时谈话的内容。被告说：他也知道了拉伊克与兰科维奇在邻近匈牙利边境的巴克斯城附近猎场秘密会谈的内容。
    被告说：在这次会谈中，就我所知，兰科维奇对我们的缓慢表示不满，并且规定一九四九年春季举行武装政变；兰科维奇给予拉伊克的训令，我也经过佐凯尔上校从同一兰科维奇那里获得了。
    谋叛分子巴尔费说：那些已准备举行武装政变的人们曾计划政变后发表谈到对苏、对南友好的宣言，同时也预示匈牙利将逐渐脱离和平民主阵营而投靠到帝国主义阵营。
    被告供称：他曾有系统地向布兰科夫（他知道布兰科夫是南斯拉夫驻匈牙利谍报机关的代表）提供关于匈国军事和政治情况的秘密情报。
    布兰科夫曾把巴尔费介绍给新到的南斯拉夫武官洛齐奇上校，洛齐奇对布兰拉夫说，他（巴尔费）在南斯拉夫的地位很高。此后，巴尔费就将他的谍报报告交给了南斯拉夫驻匈牙利新武官洛齐奇上校。
    制定武装叛变计划阴谋杀害拉科西等
    一九四七年十月，由洛齐奇获悉游击队代表大会将要在罗马举行，被告执行其所得到的任务，在拉伊克的帮助下，使自己得以匈牙利游击队代表的资格参加代表大会，而他与游击队是毫无任何关系的。在这次大会上，象预先所安排的，巴尔费会到了南斯拉夫涅捷尔科维奇上校，后者按照铁托的命令把铁托的计划告诉被告并给以新的训令。巴尔费在法庭的供词中扼要地描述了被告拉伊克已于昨日谈到的铁托的计划。
    巴尔费称：政变的准备工作交由拉伊克全盘指挥，由我负责军事的准备，我告诉涅捷尔科维奇说：我同意这一计划。我曾以会谈情况告诉拉伊克，而他告诉我说：他已经知道了。
    被告详述他曾如何确保了兰科维奇所乘搭的往晤拉伊克的汽车得以秘密越过边境。他提到他曾与拉伊克会谈，拉伊克给他以兰科维奇的训令，要在军事政变时立即逮捕拉科西、法卡斯和格罗，并且“如遇抵抗”即把他们干掉。巴尔费称：在我所制订的计划中，这是最主要的任务。科隆第要组织三个分队，准备在深夜逮捕或暗杀拉科西、法卡斯和格罗，拉伊克称：这要他们全都在布达佩斯的那一天进行。我把这些告诉科隆第，而他告诉我说，他手下有从前的宪兵人员，利用他们来实行这个目的是适当不过的了。
    巴尔费供称：他也知道南斯拉夫政府曾允诺援助阴谋者。
    派遣尼米斯到莫斯科在苏联进行间谍活动
    被告称：通过拉伊克和佐凯尔，我接获兰科维奇要我订出武装政变的计划的训令。我在一九四八年十一月和十二月执行了这一任务。我打算用十个营来实行政变，这十个营要占领首都的要冲和工人阶级住区，在那里我们可能遇到积极的抵抗。巴尔费称：因为匈牙利工人党开始清党（半句不清—译者）而妨碍了工作的进行，故阴谋者不能确定武装政变的日期，且仅在一九四九年三月，拉伊克才决定在一九四九年五月底到六月间举行政变。
    巴尔费声称：我拟订了具体的计划，并在布达佩斯的地图上标出要占领的目标。
    这一计划和标记了的地图，巴尔费曾保藏了两个月，在他获悉拉伊克被捕后即加以焚毁。
    巴尔费供称：他曾于一九四八年成功地派遣尼米斯到莫斯科任武官，俾使后者能在苏联进行间谍活动。尼米斯曾与在匈牙利的南斯拉夫间谍分子有接触，而在莫斯科，他保持与铁托集团的谍报机关的这些接触。在情报局决议公布后，南斯拉夫驻匈牙利武官佐凯尔在与巴尔费的谈话中，强调指出尼米斯的越来越大的作用，并劝告被告称：尼米斯现在必须与南斯拉夫驻莫斯科大使姆拉佐维奇直接联系。
    被告称：在找到借口后，我把尼米斯召到布达佩斯并将此事通知他。其后尼米斯由莫斯科报告我，他已与姆拉佐维奇建立了联系。
    被告在结束其供词时称：佐凯尔上校曾告诉他，匈牙利的武装政变是美国所拟订的庞大计划的一部分，而该计划的次一目标是波兰。
    被告继在回答检察官的问题时称：他曾经从洛齐奇和佐凯尔处获悉，南斯拉夫政府不仅在匈牙利并且也在所有其他的人民民主国家进行间谍和颠覆性的活动。在回答检察官提出的另一问题时，巴尔费承认：关于“如遇抵抗时”刺杀拉科西、法卡斯和格罗的训令是在这种形式下授给他的，他明白地了解到问题的要点是无论如何要谋杀这些匈牙利国家的领袖。
    在回答检察官的另一问题时，被告巴尔费证实：就在他指导匈牙利国防部军政处（其任务是揭露外国间谍）的时候，他自己却已参加了外国间谍机关的活动。
    对被告巴尔费的讯问于此结束。
    法庭在间歇后即开始讯问被告布兰科夫。
