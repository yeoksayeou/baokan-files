　　Spies and Traitors Must Not Be Forgiven
    The Hungarian State Prosecutor's Office has brought a public prosecution against the spy and traitor case of Rajk and others under the direction of American imperialism and the Tito group. This is not only to defend Hungary's people's democratic system, but also a great victory in the world's people's struggle to defend peace and democracy.
    On the road from New Democracy to socialist construction, the Hungarian people, under the leadership of the Hungarian Workers' Party-led People's Independent Front, have achieved brilliant achievements. The Hungarian People's Independent Front, established on a broader basis than the previous National Independence Front, has not only completed the Hungarian People's Republic's three-year economic plan, but is also about to start a new five-year plan for national economic construction, successfully overcoming all the difficulties imposed by domestic and foreign enemies, completed the nationalization of large and medium-sized industries, crushed the main reactionary forces in the country, fundamentally overcame the divisive tendencies in the workers' movement, and made the Hungarian Workers' Party's prestige among the people unprecedentedly high, winning the heartfelt support of the people of the whole country.
    Precisely because of this, the imperialists and their lackeys harbor resentment towards the Hungarian Workers' Party and the people's democratic system, constantly carrying out anti-Hungarian propaganda and attempting to interfere in Hungary's internal affairs. However, they have suffered a series of shameful failures in the face of the strength of the Hungarian people. Following the failure of the reactionary Nagy group, in February of this year, the Hungarian people exposed the treasonous conspiracy of Cardinal Mindszenty under the direction of American imperialism, forcing the American consul to tuck his tail between his legs and get out of Hungary. Now, the major treason case of Rajk and others is a complete exposure and failure of the despicable conspiracy of American imperialism and its lackeys! It should be recognized that such spy and traitor conspiracies are a trick inevitably adopted by imperialism within various countries to undermine the socialist and democratic camp, and this is an integral part of the imperialist plan to invade the world. This conspiracy failed in Poland, and it also failed in Bulgaria. Now, the failure in Hungary is even more severe.
    Rajk and other small group of traitors are spies jointly planned and hired by American imperialism and the Tito group. Their infiltration into the revolutionary ranks of the Hungarian people can only be accidental and temporary, and their prosecution and sentencing by the people's laws is inevitable and unavoidable. This not only further educates the people of all countries to be more politically vigilant, and in the struggle to unite all revolutionary forces against imperialism and domestic reactionaries, we must expose and punish counter-revolutionaries and saboteurs who collude with imperialism, betray the motherland, and oppose the cause of people's democracy at any time. Moreover, this case more thoroughly proves to the people of the world how ugly and arrogant the Tito group's counter-revolutionary plan is, that it is in the same vein as the war-mongering plots of the imperialists, and it is already an undeniable fact. However, the superiority of the socialist system and the people's democratic system and the invincibility of the people's democratic forces mean that imperialism and its lackeys will have no way to deal with the powerful forces of the world's people. The Hungarian people, like the people of all people's democratic countries, are taking resolute actions to inflict crushing blows on imperialism, traitors and national sell-outs, and on all enemies who are hostile to socialism and people's democracy. We fully support the Hungarian people's legal trial of Rajk and others, because the people must never forgive all national sell-outs and saboteurs!

　　不能饶恕间谍叛国分子
    匈牙利国家检察署对于在美帝国主义与铁托集团指使下的拉伊克等间谍叛国案提起公诉，这不仅是为了保卫匈牙利的人民民主制度，而且是在世界人民保卫和平民主斗争中的一个伟大胜利。
    在从新民主主义走向社会主义建设的道路上，匈牙利人民，在以匈牙利工人党为首的人民独立阵线的领导下，已经获得了光辉的成就。匈牙利人民独立阵线，在比过去民族独立阵线更加广泛的基础上建立起来之后，不但完成了匈牙利人民共和国的三年经济计划，而且正要开始新的国民经济建设的五年计划，胜利地克服了国内外敌人所加予的一切困难，完成了大工业与中等工业的国有化，粉碎了国内主要的反动力量，从根本上克服了工人运动中的分裂主义倾向，并使匈牙利工人党在人民群众中的威信空前地提高，获得了全国人民的衷心拥护。
    正因为如此，帝国主义及其走卒们，对于匈牙利的工人党和人民民主制度怀恨在心，不断地进行其反匈牙利的宣传，并企图干涉匈牙利的内政。但是，在匈牙利人民力量的面前，它们遭到了一连串可耻的失败。继反动派奈基集团失败之后，今年二月间，匈牙利人民又揭露了美帝国主义指使下的红衣主教明曾蒂的叛国阴谋，逼使美帝的领事也不得不夹着尾巴滚出匈牙利。现在拉伊克等的大叛国案，则更是美帝国主义及其走卒们的卑鄙阴谋的彻底暴露与失败！应该认识此类间谍叛国阴谋，是帝国主义为了破坏社会主义与民主阵营的目的，在各国内部所必然采取的伎俩，这是帝国主义侵略世界计划的一个组成部分。这个阴谋在波兰曾遭致失败，在保加利亚同样遭致了失败，现在，在匈牙利的失败更为惨重。
    拉伊克等这一小撮叛国贼是美帝国主义及铁托集团合谋和雇用的间谍分子，它们混入匈牙利人民的革命队伍内部，只能是偶然的和暂时的，它们之被检举并受人民法律的判处则是必然的和不可幸免的。这不但进一步教育了各国人民在政治上要更加提高警惕，在团结一切革命力量反对帝国主义及国内反动派的斗争中，对于勾结帝国主义、背叛祖国、反对人民民主事业的反革命分子及间谍破坏分子，必须随时予以揭发和惩处。而且这个案件更彻底地向世界人民证实：铁托集团的反革命计划是多么丑恶和狂妄，它是与帝国主义战争贩子对世界的阴谋一脉相承的，已经是再明显不过的事实了。但是，社会主义制度与人民民主制度的优越性和人民民主力量之不可被战胜，帝国主义及其走卒们在强大的世界人民力量面前，将毫无办法。匈牙利人民，和各人民民主国家的人民一样，正以坚决的行动，向着帝国主义、叛徒和卖国贼，向着一切仇视社会主义与人民民主主义的敌人，施以粉碎的打击。我们完全拥护匈牙利人民对拉伊克等的法律审判，因为人民对于一切卖国贼和间谍破坏分子是决不能饶恕的！
