Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 5th: TASS, New York, September 3rd: American newspapers predict that the upcoming US-UK-Canada meeting on the British financial crisis will not lead to any large-scale effective measures to alleviate Britain's difficulties. Although some American newspapers believe that the United States will take some small measures to partially ease the situation in order to maintain US-UK political and military "unity" and military alliance, they expect that the effectiveness of these measures will not be enough to solve Britain's deepening financial crisis.

　　The New York World-Telegram stated: "Apart from studying and exploring this issue, the participants really don't have much to do." The New York Times also expressed a similar view, stating that in next week's negotiations, "there is not much hope of devising quick solutions to the problem. On the contrary, it is believed that Britain must take another dose of austerity...". American newspapers tend to believe that the United States is unlikely to agree to give Britain more large-scale financial "aid," and believe that such a development is extremely unlikely because signs indicate that when the United States itself faces a huge budget deficit, Congress is extremely unwilling to approve any more expenditures. The Wall Street Journal bluntly pointed out: "Any large-scale American plan to help the United Kingdom or the Sterling Area find a balanced international balance of payments is impossible." At the same time, the newspaper pointed out that representatives of the American business community advocate giving Britain a small symbolic "aid," but at the same time, they hope to pressure British negotiators to lower the living standards of British workers.

　　American newspapers also pointed out that US, Canadian and British officials remain pessimistic about the chances of finding long-term solutions at the upcoming meeting. "Worker's Daily" reporter Kabel claimed in his special article: This pessimistic prediction was obviously encouraged by officials of the US Treasury Department in order to force the British representatives into a defensive position. Hall stated: The American representatives forced Britain to "reduce the price they demanded and enhance Washington's position in bargaining." Kabel claimed that the American ruling class has two goals for Britain: first, "to maintain the United Kingdom as an ally of American imperialism in the Cold War"; second, "to politically and economically reduce the British Empire to the status of a Wall Street satellite."

　　华盛顿继续压迫伦敦
  　美英矛盾无法缓和
    美报对三国金融会议咸表悲观
    【新华社北平五日电】塔斯社纽约三日讯：美国报纸预计，美英加行将举行的关于英国金融危机的会议，不会导向任何缓和英国困难的大规模的有效措施。虽然一部分美国报纸相信，美国会采取一些小的办法，来部分地缓和情势，以保持美英的政治与军事“统一”及军事联盟。但是，它们预料，这些措施的效力，都不足以解决英国正在深刻化的金融危机。
    纽约世界电讯报称：“除了研究与探讨这一问题之外，与会者真是没有很多的事情可作。”纽约时报也表示类似的见解称，在下周的谈判中，“拟出迅速解决问题的补救之策，是没有多大希望的。相反地，人们认为英国要再服一剂节约剂，乃是当然之事………。美国报纸倾向于认为美国不可能同意给英国更多的大量财政“援助”，并认为这样的发展极不可能，因为迹象指出，在美国自身面临庞大的预算赤字时，国会极不愿同意再开支任何款项。华尔街日报直率地指出：“任何美国援助联合王国或英镑区域寻找金圆的平衡国际收支的大规模计划，都是不可能的。”与此同时，该报指出，美国商界代表主张给英国一小笔象征性的“援助”，但在同时，他们又希望压迫英国的谈判代表抑低英国工人的生活水准。
    美国报纸又指出，美国、加拿大及英国的官方代表，对于在即将到来的会议中寻得长期解决办法的机会仍抱悲观。“工人日报”记者加贝尔在他的专文中宣称：这种悲观的预料，显然为美国财政部的官员所鼓动，以迫使英国的代表处于守势。霍尔称：美国代表如此迫使英国“减低他们要求的代价，并增强华盛顿在讨价还价中的地位”。加贝尔宣称，美国统治阶级对英国有两个目标：一，“维持联合王国作为美帝国主义在冷战中的盟友”；二，“将大英帝国在政治上及经济上均降为华尔街卫星的地位”。
