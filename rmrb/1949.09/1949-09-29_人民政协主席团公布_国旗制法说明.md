Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 28th -- The Presidium of the First Plenary Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference today announced the following specifications for the production of the national flag:

National Flag Production Specifications (The shape and color of the national flag are the same on both sides, and the five stars on the flag are opposite each other on both sides. For convenience, this document only uses the side with the flagpole on the left as the standard for description. For the side with the flagpole on the right, all references to "left" in this document should be changed to "right," and all references to "right" should be changed to "left.")

(1) The flag surface is red, rectangular, with a length-to-height ratio of three to two. Five yellow five-pointed stars are attached to the upper left of the flag surface. One star is larger, with its circumcircle diameter being three-tenths of the flag's height, and is located on the left; four stars are smaller, with their circumcircle diameter being one-tenth of its height, and encircle the right of the large star. The flagpole sleeve is white.

(2) The positions and drawing methods of the five stars are as follows:

　　A. To facilitate determining the position of the five stars, first divide the flag surface into four equal rectangles, and divide the upper left rectangle into ten equal parts vertically and fifteen equal parts horizontally.

　　B. The center point of the large five-pointed star is located at the point five-tenths up and down, and five-fifteenths left and ten-fifteenths right in that rectangle. The drawing method is: using this point as the center, draw a circle with a radius of three divisions. On this circumference, determine five equidistant points, one of which must be located directly above the circle. Then, connect every other two of these five points to form a straight line. The outer contour formed by these five straight lines is the required large five-pointed star. One corner of the five-pointed star points directly upward.

　　C. The center points of the four small five-pointed stars are: the first point is at two-tenths up and eight-tenths down, and ten-fifteenths left and five-fifteenths right in that rectangle; the second point is at four-tenths up and six-tenths down, and twelve-fifteenths left and three-fifteenths right; the third point is at seven-tenths up and three-tenths down, and twelve-fifteenths left and three-fifteenths right; the fourth point is at nine-tenths up and one-tenth down, and ten-fifteenths left and five-fifteenths right. The drawing method is: using the above four points as the center, draw four circles with a radius of one division respectively. On each circle, determine five equidistant points, each of which must have one point located on the connecting line between the center point of the large five-pointed star and the above four circle centers. Then, using the same method as constructing the large five-pointed star, construct the small five-pointed stars. Each of these four small five-pointed stars has one corner pointing directly at the center point of the large five-pointed star.

(3) The common dimensions of the national flag are set as the following five types, and all sectors may choose according to their circumstances:

　　1. Length 288 cm, height 191 cm.
　　2. Length 240 cm, height 160 cm.
　　3. Length 192 cm, height 128 cm.
　　4. Length 144 cm, height 96 cm.
　　5. Length 96 cm, height 64 cm.

　　人民政协主席团公布
  　国旗制法说明
    【新华社北京二十八日电】中国人民政治协商会议第一届全体会议主席团今日公布国旗制法说明如下：
    国旗制法说明（国旗的形状颜色两面相同，旗上五星两面相对。为便利计，本件仅以旗杆在左之一面为说明之标准。对于旗杆在右之一面，凡本件所称左均应改右，所称右均应改左。）
    （一）旗面为红色，长方形，其长与高为三与二之比，旗面左上方缀黄色五角星五颗。一星较大，其外接圆直径为旗高十分之三，居左；四星较小，其外接圆直径为其高十分之一，环拱于大星之右。旗杆套为白色。
    （二）五星之位置与画法如下：
    甲、为便于确定五星之位置，先将旗面对分为四个相等的长方形，将左上方之长方形上下划为十等分，左右划为十五等分。
    乙、大五角星的中心点，在该长方形上五下五、左五右十之处。其画法为：以此点为圆心，以三等分为半径作一圆。在此圆周上，定出五个等距离的点，其一点须位于圆之正上方。然后将此五点中各相隔的两点相联，使各成一直线。此五直线所构成之外轮廓线，即为所需之大五角星。五角星之一个角尖正向上方。
    丙、四颗小五角星的中心点，第一点在该长方形上二下八、左十右五之处，第二点在上四下六、左十二右三之处，第三点在上七下三、左十二右三之处，第四在上九下一、左十右五之处。其画法为：以以上四点为圆心，各以一等分为半径，分别作四个圆。在每个圆上各定出五个等距离的点，其中均须各有一点位于大五角星中心点与以上四个圆心的各联结线上。然后用构成大五角星的同样方法，构成小五角星。此四个小五角星均各有一个角尖正对大五角星的中心点。
    （三）国旗之通用尺度定为如下五种，各界酌情选用：
    一、长二八八公分，高一九一公分。
    二、长二四○公分，高一六○公分。
    三、长一九二公分，高一二八公分。
    四、长一四四公分，高九六公分。
    五、长九六公分，高六四公分。
