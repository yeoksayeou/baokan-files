Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, September 11th: Ye Chao, the Chief of Staff of the mechanized forces of the Third Field Army of the People's Liberation Army, said when denouncing the American White Paper: "We want to warn the American imperialist elements: Our People's Liberation Army's mechanized units have been equipped by you through the hands of the Chiang bandits. We have already defeated the entire military force of the Kuomintang reactionaries, which you equipped, and we already have a sufficiently strong force to defend our motherland. Whether you blockade us or sabotage us, we must rapidly liberate Taiwan and liberate all of China." This indignant sentiment towards the American White Paper filled the entire Third Field Army. Many former Kuomintang military officers who joined the Third Field Army also used their own experiences to refute the fallacies in the White Paper. Liu Weihua, the former Chief of Staff of the Engineering Corps Command of the Kuomintang Garrison Headquarters of the Nanjing-Shanghai-Hangzhou area, and Fang Jigeng, a former instructor at the Kuomintang Artillery School, said: When the Kuomintang bandit army frantically attacked the Soviet, Shandong, Henan, and Anhui liberated areas in 1946, American military advisors frequently instructed Gu Zhutong in operations in Xuzhou. In the Longhai Railway Campaign in 1947, American military advisors participated in the Kuomintang's operational plans. The reorganization of the puppet Ministry of National Defense in 1946 was implemented only after being approved by the U.S. military advisory group stationed in China. The operations of each department and section, and even each staff member, of the puppet Ministry of National Defense were specifically stipulated by the U.S. military advisory group. The 100,000 rounds of howitzer shells used by Du Yuming's bandit troops in the Huaihai Campaign were rushed from Okinawa by the U.S. government. Before the liberation of Shanghai, the U.S. military advisory group was still inspecting and guiding the bandit troops in building so-called "permanent" city defense fortifications in the suburbs. They said: There are too many examples of American imperialism directly slaughtering the Chinese people. This is the "close friendship" with the Chinese people that Acheson spoke of. Wei Laiguo, the battalion commander of a certain army guard battalion and a sharpshooting hero of East China, said: "American imperialism has confessed its consistent conspiracies and tricks in the White Paper, but it cannot deceive or scare us. We have already overthrown the Kuomintang reactionaries it supported and are prepared to expel all imperialist forces from China!"

　　第三野战军
　  愤怒指斥白皮书
    一定要迅速解放全中国驱逐一切帝国主义势力
    【新华社南京十一日电】人民解放军第三野战军机械化兵种特种纵队的参谋长叶超在斥责美国白皮书时说：“我们要警告美帝国主义分子：我们人民解放军的机械化部队，已由你们借蒋匪之手，把我们装备起来。我们已经击败了由你们装备起来的国民党反动派的整个军事力量，我们已经有足够强大的力量来捍卫祖国，管你封锁也罢，破坏也罢，我们一定要迅速解放台湾，解放全中国。”对于美国白皮书的这种激愤情绪，充满了第三野战军的整个部队。许多参加第三野战军的前国民党军军官也纷纷以自己亲历的事实来驳斥白皮书中的谰言。前国民党京沪杭警备总司令部工兵指挥部参谋长刘伟华、国民党炮兵学校教官方几更等说：一九四六年国民党匪军疯狂进攻苏、鲁、豫、皖解放区时，美军事顾问经常在徐州指示顾祝同作战。一九四七年陇海路战役中，美国军事顾问参与了国民党的作战计划。一九四六年伪国防部的改编，是经驻华美军事顾问团批准后才实行的，伪国防部的各处、科甚至每个参谋的业务都由美国军事顾问团具体规定。淮海战役中杜聿明匪部用的十万发榴弹炮炮弹，就是美国政府从冲绳岛赶运来的。上海解放之前，美军顾问团还在市郊巡视和指导匪军建立所谓“永久性”城防工事。他们说：美帝国主义这种直接屠杀中国人民的例子太多了。这就是艾奇逊所说的对中国人民“亲密的友谊”。某军警卫营营长华东射击英雄魏来国说：“美帝国主义在白皮书上供出了他的一贯的阴谋诡计，但他骗不了也吓不倒我们，我们已经打倒了他支持下的国民党反动派，并准备驱逐一切帝国主义势力出中国去！”
