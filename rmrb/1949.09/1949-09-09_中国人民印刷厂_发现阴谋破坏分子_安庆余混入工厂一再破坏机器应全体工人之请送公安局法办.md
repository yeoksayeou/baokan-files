China People's Printing Factory
　　Discovers Saboteurs
An Qingyu Sneaks into Factory and Repeatedly Damages Machines; Sent to Public Security Bureau for Legal Action at the Request of All Workers
[Reported by this newspaper] Last month, the Beiping China People's Printing Factory discovered a saboteur, who has now been handed over to the Fourth Branch of the Public Security Bureau for legal action.
　　Around 11:00 PM on the night shift of the 26th of last month, An Qingyu, a paper feeder on machine number 23 in a certain division of the People's Printing Factory, took advantage of the absence of his three fellow workers who had gone to submit tickets and collect cloth. When no one was paying attention, he suddenly threw over a hundred sheets of damp printing paper into the printing press. As a result, thirty-seven sheets were drawn in, and the iron frame of the roller instantly cracked, causing the machine to stop. Afterwards, the factory director, the Communist Party branch secretary, and the chairman of the trade union immediately investigated and spoke with An Qingyu, asking him to thoroughly examine his mistakes. However, An Qingyu not only did not repent, but upon returning to the workshop, he chopped the iron roller four times, his deliberate sabotage of production reaching a point of madness. For the sake of prudence, the Party, government, and trade union of the factory continued to investigate and sought the opinions of the workers in that division. It was learned that An Qingyu had been a military police officer in the 19th Regiment of the Kuomintang Military Police and a plainclothes agent in the puppet police bureau before liberation. After liberation, he infiltrated the factory and carried out sabotage activities. He ridiculed and attacked active workers when their production volume increased, and even threatened workers with hooligan tactics. The group leader and machine operator had educated him many times without success. In mid-July, An Qingyu attempted to sabotage the machine once by stuffing eighteen sheets of paper into it. Fortunately, the machine operator Liu Fengshan was alert and immediately pulled the brake, thus saving the machine. This shows that An Qingyu has been deliberately sabotaging the machine for a long time and is a complete enemy of the people.
　　On the 8th, the Party, government, and trade union of the factory jointly convened a meeting of all the workers in the division to report on An Qingyu's criminal acts of sabotaging the machine and to discuss how to deal with An Qingyu. This immediately aroused unanimous anger among the workers, who shouted, "Beat him to death!" They believed: "An Qingyu deliberately sabotages the machine, willingly acts as Chiang Kai-shek's running dog, destroys the people's public property, undermines the people's construction cause, and breaks the workers' rice bowls, which violates the interests of the people of the whole country, especially the working class. Therefore, he is not worthy of being called a worker, but rather an enemy of the working class." The workers unanimously demanded his immediate expulsion and that he be handed over to the Public Security Bureau for severe punishment. At the same time, another worker proposed that all the workers in the factory should be more vigilant, thoroughly eliminate saboteurs, and strictly prevent Kuomintang secret agents from engaging in activities in order to protect the people's property and the greatest interests of the working class. The administration immediately accepted everyone's opinions and handed over An Qingyu, along with the evidence of sabotage, to the Fourth Branch of the Public Security Bureau for legal action.

　　中国人民印刷厂
  　发现阴谋破坏分子
    安庆余混入工厂一再破坏机器应全体工人之请送公安局法办
    【本报讯】北平中国人民印刷厂上月发现阴谋破坏分子，现已送交公安局外四分局法办。
    上月二十六日夜班十一时许，人民印刷厂某股二十三号机铺纸工人安庆余乘其同机工人三人外出交票、卷布、无人注意之时，突然将已湿过之印刷纸百余张投入印刷机中，结果被卷入三十七张，过轮铁架顿时崩裂，机器被破坏停顿，事后该厂厂长，及共产党支部书记与工会主任当即加以调查，并和安庆余谈话，要他切实检讨自己的错误，但安庆余非但不知改悔，回到工房又将铁滚筒连砍四刀，其蓄意破坏生产已到了疯狂的程度。该厂党、政、工三方为了慎重起见，仍继续进行调查，并向该股工人征求意见。得知安庆余解放前为国民党宪兵十九团宪兵及伪警察局便衣，解放后混入厂内，进行破坏活动。看到积极工人生产量增加时便加以讥讽打击，甚至以流氓手段威胁工人。该股组长、领机曾多次向其教育无效。七月中安庆余曾企图破坏机器一次，用十八张纸塞进机器，幸而领机刘凤山机警，立刻拉了闸，因此机器得以保全。由此可见安庆余蓄意破坏机器已久，为一十足的人民公敌。
    八日该厂党、政、工联合召集该股全体工人开会，报告安庆余破坏机器的罪恶经过，并商讨处理安庆余的办法。立刻引起全场工人一致的愤怒，高喊：“揍死他”！他们认为：“安庆余蓄意破坏机器，甘愿作蒋介石的走狗，破坏人民的公共财产，破坏人民的建设事业，打破工人的饭碗，是违反全国人民，尤其是工人阶级的利益的。所以他不配称为工人，而是工人阶级的敌人。”工人一致要求立即开除，并送公安局严办。同时另有工人提议，全厂工友提高警惕，彻底肃清破坏分子，严防国民党特务活动，以维护人民财产与工人阶级的最大利益。行政上当即接受大家的意见，将安庆余连同破坏证物一并解送公安局外四分局法办。
