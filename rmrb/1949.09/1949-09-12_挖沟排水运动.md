　　Ditch Digging and Drainage Campaign
　　Ma Zong
　　From July to August, there was a lot of rain, and water accumulated everywhere. The water in the ditches overflowed onto the roads, and some fields became like small ponds. This situation was very harmful to crops. Therefore, in order to help the villagers and protect the crops, our troops launched a ditch digging and drainage campaign.
　　This campaign was carried out through the call of the Party branch and the Soldiers' Committee. Comrades voluntarily signed up to participate, and Party members and cadres played a leading role in it. The work formed a competition: to see who dug the best and who did the most. Everyone worked actively, demonstrating the People's Army's excellent mass perspective and spirit of labor. Some comrades worked while sick; one soldier had a sore on his ankle, which was so swollen that he had difficulty walking, but he still insisted on working in the mud. Many comrades did not have tools, so they came up with ways to use their hands instead: one person piled up mud, and the other carried it away. Their whole bodies were wet with mud, and they sang while working. The villagers said, "Everyone, take a break!" But no one wanted to rest. They said, "The villagers' crops are being flooded, shouldn't we hurry up and rescue them!? The villagers' lives are so hard, we talk about the mass perspective and helping the villagers every day, if we don't really take action to show it, what kind of People's Army are we?"
　　The villagers saw with their own eyes the People's Liberation Army serving the people in this way, and they all said, "If it weren't for your help, this year's crops would be ruined!" An old man in his seventies or eighties grabbed a soldier and said to him, "The Kuomintang lied to me, saying that when the Eighth Route Army came, everyone over the age of sixty would be killed. But seeing how you care for the people and work for them like this, damn it, who would still believe those lies!?"
　　After this ditch digging and drainage campaign, the comrades all felt very happy, because saving the crops meant saving many villagers. Some comrades said, "We work for the villagers, and it feels like we are in a political class." That's right, this is called turning slogans into practical actions.

　　挖沟排水运动
    马宗
    从七月到八月，下了很多雨，到处都积满了水。阳沟里的水满到路上了，有些田地变得象个小池塘。这种情形对于庄稼的损害是很大的。于是，为了帮助老乡，保护庄稼，我们的部队就发动了一次挖沟排水运动。
    这个运动是通过党支部和军人会的号召进行的。同志们都自动报名参加，党员和干部在其中更起了带头作用。工作形成一种竞赛：看谁挖得好，看谁做得多。大家都积极地工作，表现出人民军队优良的群众观点和劳动精神。有的同志是带病干的，一位战士脚踝生疮，肿得行走不便，还是在泥水中坚持工作。许多同志没有工具，就想出法子用手代替：一个用手堆泥，一个抱着走。他们全身都给泥水打湿了，一面唱歌一面干。老乡们说：“大伙儿歇一歇气吧！”但是谁都不愿休息，他们说：“老乡们的庄稼都淹坏了，还不赶快抢救吗！？老乡们生活可苦哩，咱们天天都讲群众观点，讲帮助老乡，要不真正拿行动出来表现，还算个啥的人民军队？”
    老乡们亲眼瞧见解放军这种为人民服务的情形，他们都说：“若是没有你们帮忙，今年庄稼可糟了！”一位七八十岁的老大爷拉着一位战士，对他讲：“国民党骗我说，八路军一来，上了六十岁年纪的都给杀光。可是看见你们这样爱护老百姓，这样给老百姓干活，他妈的，谁还信那些瞎话！？”
    这一次的挖沟排水运动，同志们干完以后都感觉非常愉快，因为救活了庄稼就是救了不少老乡。有的同志说：“咱们给老乡们干活，心里就象在上政治课。”可不是，这就叫做把口号变成实际行动干起来。
