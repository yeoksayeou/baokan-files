  　The People of Pingyuan Province Conquered the Flood: No Accidents in the Middle Reaches of the Yellow River for Two Years
    [Xinxiang Telegraph] Pingyuan Province is located in the middle reaches of the Yellow River. Due to its flat terrain and alluvial silt, it has historically been plagued by floods, and is known as the "copper head, iron tail, and tofu waist." However, under the leadership of the People's Government, and as a result of the efforts of all flood prevention cadres and the masses to fight the flood, there have been no breaches for two years. The following experiences were gained in flood prevention work:
    First, overcome complacency in leadership and mobilize the masses in depth. In late July, when the Yellow River's water rose sharply for the second time, leading comrades in the Fourth District of Shou Zhang conducted a self-criticism of their thinking and began to work conscientiously. In mobilizing the masses, they combined it with ideological education about the past suffering from floods, making everyone realize that flood prevention is a glorious task to protect everyone and their own lives and property. Therefore, as soon as the notice was issued, all dike and house flood prevention personnel were present. At the same time, the tasks assigned to village cadres were also very specific, and the phenomenon of neglect in the preparation of tools and materials in individual villages was checked and corrected in a timely manner. In the flood prevention work, capable flood prevention personnel were selected and formed into a rescue commando team, while the elderly and weak were responsible for transportation. The commando team, after clearly dividing the labor, played a great role in the rescue. Secondly, it is necessary to correct empiricism and departmentalism in flood prevention. "The 15th of July determines drought and flood, and the 15th of August determines the gale." These popular sayings mean that the various rises in water during the flood season will not exceed the highest water level of the first time. But the facts are not so. Actual examples should be used to correct the narrow and one-sided empiricism of the masses. The selfish and self-interested departmentalism of "helping the upper reaches but not the lower reaches" and "the two banks not helping each other" in flood prevention should be completely changed. In the flood prevention organization, manpower and material resources should be used centrally and unified dispatching should occur. Last year, when rescuing the dangerous project at Gao Village in Dongming, the manpower and material resources of twelve counties on the north and south banks were mobilized. This year, when the Zhu Kou and Liu Zhuang dangerous projects in Heze were in critical condition, not only were the engineering teams from the nearby north and south banks concentrated to rescue them, but also the engineering teams as far away as Kaifeng, Henan, rushed to reinforce them, so that the danger could be turned into safety. Third, appropriately take care of the production of the families of flood prevention personnel, so that flood prevention personnel can work more at ease and actively. In the Liu Cutui Village of Shou Zhang, a temporary mutual aid group was established during the flood season to determine that four families would help one flood prevention family do the work in the fields; Yuhuangling and other villages proposed to ensure that the production of the flood prevention family would not be delayed, and checked each household to help specifically. The positive mood of the flood prevention personnel was thereby consolidated.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 7th] Shandong Yellow River summer flood has been safely passed through the efforts of the Party, government, army, and people along the river. Since July, the Yellow River water level has risen sharply three times. The Shandong Branch of the CPC Central Committee and the Shandong Provincial People's Government issued an emergency instruction during the second water rise, mobilizing people from all over the province to prevent floods and carry out rescue. According to incomplete statistics: During the summer flood season, more than 500,600 people in the province participated in flood prevention. The embankment projects in only five counties and cities, including Lijin and Jinan, used more than 115,000 cubic meters of earth and more than 60,000 man-days. In flood prevention, county party secretaries, county governors, and other officials of all counties personally led the masses to rescue. At the end of July, a dangerous project at Qian Zuozhuang in Kenli County (newly established county, northeast of Lijin) was in danger, and the dikes collapsed and water flowed out. The river defense engineering team, with the cooperation of more than 2,000 workers, carried out emergency repairs day and night, turning the crisis into safety. Dangerous projects such as Chen Mengquan in Zhangli County (newly established county, parts of Zhangqiu and Licheng) also had water flowing out, and have been generally heightened after rescue. Other embankments along the river have also been surveyed and repaired. At present, various places are continuing to thicken and heighten and repair work to prevent the autumn flood.

### 在人民政府大力领导下　平原省人民战胜洪水黄河中游两年未出险

　　在人民政府大力领导下
  　平原省人民战胜洪水黄河中游两年未出险
    【新乡电】平原省地处黄河中游，以地势平坦，泥沙冲积，历来洪水为害，素有“铜头铁尾豆腐腰”之称；但在人民政府领导下，全体防汛干部与群众努力与洪水作斗争的结果，两年来迄未决口。在防汛工作中，获得了如下经验：
    首先是克服领导上的麻痹思想，深入发动群众。七月下旬黄水二次猛涨，寿张四区的领导同志经过思想检查，便认真的工作起来，在发动群众方面，结合过去水淹苦境，进行思想教育，使共同认识防汛是为保护大家也为保护自己生命财产而奋斗的光荣任务，所以一发出通知，各堤屋防汛员即全部到齐。同时对村干部布置任务也极具体，并及时检查纠正了个别村庄准备工具物料的忽视现象。在防汛工作中，选拔干练防汛员编成抢险突击队，老弱的则担任运输。明确分工后的突击队，在抢险中起了很大作用。其次要纠正防汛中的经验主义和本位主义。“七月十五定旱涝，八月十五定岚戈”。这些流行的谚语即是说汛期的各次涨水，都不会超过第一次的最高水位。但事实并非如此。要用实际例子来纠正群众的狭隘片面的经验主义。防汛中“帮上不帮下”“两岸不相救”的自私自利的本位思想，应彻底改变。在防汛组织上应集中使用人力物力，统一调度。去年抢救东明高村险工时，动用了南北两岸十二个县的人力物力，今年菏泽朱口、刘庄险工危急时，不但集中了附近南北两岸的工程队抢救，即远在河南开封的工程队，也赶来增援，才得化险为夷。第三要适当地照顾防汛员家庭生产，使防汛员更加安心积极工作。寿张刘粗腿村在汛期成立临时互助组，确定四家帮一家防汛员作地里的活；玉皇岭等村提出保证不误防汛员家里的生产，并挨家检查，具体帮助。防汛员的积极情绪由此得以巩固。
    【新华社济南七日电】山东黄河夏汛经沿河党政军民的努力防治，已安全渡过。自七月以来，黄河水位曾猛涨三次。中共中央山东分局、山东省人民政府于第二次水涨时即发布紧急指示，动员各地人民防汛抢险。据不完全统计：夏汛期中全省参加防汛者达五十万零六千余人。仅利津济南等五个县市的修堤工程，即用土十一万五千余方，用人工六万余个。在防汛中，各县中共县委书记、县长等都亲自率领群众抢救。七月底垦利县（新设县，利津东北部）前左庄险工出险，各埝坝下塌出水，河防工程队在二千余民工配合下昼夜进行抢修，转危为安。章历县（新设县，章邱、历城各一部）陈孟圈等险工亦曾出水，经抢救后，已普遍加高。沿河其他堤岸亦进行了勘查修补。现各地正继续进行培厚加高及修补工作，防范秋汛。
