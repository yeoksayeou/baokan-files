Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 15th, TASS Moscow, September 13th: The "Moscow Komsomol" newspaper recently published an article by Danasurun, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Republic Revolutionary Youth League, entitled "The Youth of the Mongolian People's Republic Fighting for Peace and Against Instigators of a New War." The article stated: Under the leadership of the People's Revolutionary Party, the Mongolian people are confidently and steadily moving towards socialism. The Mongolian Revolutionary Youth League is a mass advanced youth organization and a loyal assistant to the People's Revolutionary Party. The Youth League was established in August 1921, initiated by the Mongolian revolutionary leaders Sukhe Bator and Choibalsan. It firmly follows the leadership of the People's Revolutionary Party, helping the Party to solve major tasks in developing the economy and culture, enhancing the defense capabilities of the Mongolian Republic, and strengthening the country's integrity and independence. The Youth League's work teams, established in industries and state-owned farms across the country, constitute an active force, standing in the ranks of factory shock workers. They are also advanced livestock breeders who increase herds and improve livestock production rates. The Youth League helps state-owned farms, striving to make them model farms for the Mongolian people.

The Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and the government highly value the Youth League's contributions. Tens of thousands of young men and women are proficient in various industries. We have national universities, research institutes, and vocational schools. Every region has secondary schools or junior high schools. The People's Government has opened up all paths for young people to live and work.

Our youth are proud of their friendship with the youth of the great Soviet Union. We regard friendship with the Soviet people as a guarantee of our achievements and carefully study the rich experience of Soviet youth. The young men and women of the Mongolian People's Republic are actively struggling for the freedom and independence of all nations around the world, for universal security, peace, and democracy. Our Youth League and the entire youth of the Republic have joined the ranks of the World Federation of Democratic Youth and actively participate in all its undertakings. The youth of our country are determined not to allow their happy lives to be harmed. We hate the Anglo-American warmongers and regard the struggle to consolidate lasting peace as our primary responsibility.
