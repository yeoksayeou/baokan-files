　　The so-called “tribal independent zone” in Pakistan’s Northwest Frontier Province is increasingly becoming a turbulent and disruptive area.

　　The main residents of the Northwest Frontier Province are Afghans – including Afridis, Waziris, Momands, and other Pashtun tribes – numbering more than five million. Before 1893, the “tribal independent zone” was part of Afghanistan, but was later separated from Afghanistan under a British arbitrary treaty and merged into India. During the half-century of the merger, the Northwest Frontier Province has been in constant turmoil with people’s uprisings and tribal riots in opposition to British oppression and colonial exploitation.

　　In 1947, when preparations were being made to divide India into two dominions, the Pashtun people were deeply agitated. A powerful farmers' organization in the Frontier Province, the "Red Shirts," demanded that the province and all other parts of India with Afghan residents form an independent state – Pashtunistan. The leader of the "Red Shirts" demanded a referendum. However, the British authorities refused and decided to incorporate the Northwest Frontier Province into Pakistan.

　　Now Anglo-American imperialism is using the Pashtun issue to achieve its own long-term plans. Military conflicts occur not only within the British dominion but also from time to time between Pakistan and Afghanistan. From the beginning, the founders of the partition of India intended to make the Northwest Frontier Province a region of dispute at the important political focal point of Asia. Now they are inciting hatred between Afghanistan and Pakistan to begin implementing this part of the plan.

　　The first event that worsened relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan was the bombing of the border area by Pakistani planes in January last year. Afghan newspapers loudly protested against the Pakistani authorities for deliberately launching armed attacks; and emphasized the blood ties between Afghans and Pashtuns, demanding that the Pashtuns decide their own future. Pakistani newspapers condemned Afghanistan’s sympathy for the Pashtuns’ demand to establish Pashtunistan.

　　As is well known, the United States is increasing its influence in Afghanistan. U.S. imperialism is strengthening its control and plans to further penetrate areas that are still held by Britain. American newspapers encourage all circles in Kabul (the capital of Afghanistan – translator's note) to follow the example of the United States and incite anti-Soviet sentiment opposed by the Afghan people. The Anglo-American bloc intends to use the disputes between Afghanistan and Pakistan to achieve its own imperialist intentions, as revealed in an article in the authoritative American "Christian Science Monitor" last December. This article was published with the triumphant title "U.S. Influence Growing in Afghanistan," arbitrarily slandering that the Soviet Union has become a threat to Afghanistan.

　　But which countries are the real threat to Afghanistan was soon revealed by the Egyptian newspaper "Anida." In early June, the newspaper reported that U.S.-Afghan relations were facing a crisis because the Afghan government intended to abolish its contract with the American construction company "Morrison-Knudsen" (which was engaged in military and strategic construction work in Afghanistan).

　　According to the newspaper, the Afghan government held sufficient written evidence that American engineers were more interested in taking photographs and surveying minerals in Afghanistan than in the construction work they were supervising. In addition, the company's employees were busy conducting pro-American propaganda, trying to boast to the Afghan people about the "superiority of the American system." The Afghan government has become alert to the fact that American businessmen are carrying out their own improper activities. The newspaper claimed that the Afghan government decided to reject the new five-year work plan proposed by the company.

　　These facts show how completely hypocritical Anglo-American imperialism is toward the Pashtun people's struggle for liberation. They all pretend to be friends of the Pashtuns, even "warriors" for their independence. In fact, they want to satisfy their own greedy desires, secretly seize control of key positions, establish bases in disputed areas, and expand and consolidate their influence there.

　　Afghan newspapers said that Pashtuns held large-scale anti-Pakistan demonstrations; Pakistani newspapers, Reuters, and the British Broadcasting Corporation had a different story, such as the "Sind Observer" reported in April that the chiefs of the Orakzai had convened a meeting of tribal elders, protesting against the anti-Pakistan propaganda in Afghan broadcasts and deciding to sever all relations with Afghanistan.

　　The events were not limited to verbal abuse. On June 12, Pakistani planes bombed some villages in Afghanistan. The Afghan government lodged a strong protest with the Pakistani authorities.

　　Foreign newspapers, led by Britain, publicized that troops had been concentrated on the border between the two countries. According to Kabul Radio, British officers were sent to the Northwest Frontier Province, nominally to participate in Pakistani military exercises.

　　The "Manchester Guardian" hurriedly emphasized Britain's interests in the Afghanistan-Pakistan dispute. On June 6, the newspaper assured Pakistan that it could obtain the support of the British Empire if it were subjected to foreign attack.

　　After the intervention of Anglo-American imperialism, the Afghanistan-Pakistan dispute has developed to the point where foreign mediation is needed. According to a Cairo dispatch from a French newspaper, on June 5, Afghan officials stationed in Egypt asked the chairman of the "Arab League," Pasha, to mediate between the two countries.

　　This trick has further deteriorated the relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan. It seems to us that this trick leaves the true national interests of the Pashtun people behind. Imperialism is turning the "Pashtun Tribal Independent Zone" into something completely different.

　　The contradictions between Anglo-American monopoly capitalists have not prevented London and Washington from working together on long-term plans for aggressive strategic purposes, using this area—near the Soviet border. This was clearly revealed in a speech by Cairo, the former governor of the Northwest Frontier Province, at the Royal Society in London on April 6. After making many rude attacks on the Soviet Union, Cairo declared that Britain had been successful in protecting the empire's interests in India, Pakistan, and the Frontier Province "with strength and diplomacy." He added:

　　"From Istanbul to Karachi and even the Middle East, perhaps a new group should be formed to maintain stability in this region. This is not just Waziristan, but the Northwest Frontier Province... To make it effective, the Atlantic countries that mainly occupy oil and transportation interests in this region must support such a group. The countries in this region must provide bases to have in-depth defenses."

　　From these words, we can clearly see that the current instigation of the Pashtun issue is related to the acquisition of bases by Britain and the United States in Asia. Behind the Afghanistan-Pakistan dispute is actually the imperialists wanting to deprive the nominal independence of the countries in this region and force them to join groups that are subordinate to London and Washington.

　　London and Washington's manipulation of the Pashtun people's national sentiments is only to cover up the true purpose they are pursuing. But their actions are more moving than their rhetoric.

　　If Britain tells Pakistan that it can get its support in the event of an armed conflict with Afghanistan, Wall Street's agents will rush to provide the Afghan government with their "military assistance."

　　The "Pravda" correspondent in Delhi reported on April 22 that the advisor to the U.S. Embassy in Kabul proposed a draft agreement to the King of Afghanistan, stipulating that the United States would send a military delegation of 300 officers and experts in three years to "assist" the modernization of the Afghan army.

　　The U.S. imperialists who forced this agreement on Afghanistan used the old method. We know that in order to achieve the goal of obtaining army bases and airports in Iran, the U.S. also forced an agreement on the Tehran government, stipulating that it could send its military and administrative advisors to various departments of the Iranian government and seize control of key political and economic positions.

　　There is no doubt that Afghanistan and Pakistan can achieve a fair solution to the Pashtun issue by peaceful means. But for them to be able to do this, Anglo-American intervention must stop. The increasing severity of the dispute between Afghanistan and Pakistan is provoked by imperialism, which is not good for the Pashtun people, Afghanistan, or Pakistan.

### 在阿富汗巴基斯坦争议中英美怎样进行干涉

　　在阿富汗巴基斯坦争议中英美怎样进行干涉
    阿塔孟诺夫著  沈予译
    巴基斯坦西北边疆省中的所谓“种族独立区”越发成为一个紊乱骚扰地区了。
    西北边疆省主要居民是阿富汗人——有阿富里得斯人、瓦兹人、莫孟得人和其它的培赞族——数目在五百万人以上。一八九三年以前“种族独立区”是阿富汗的一部，其后在英国独断的条约下，从阿富汗分出来，合并于印度。在合并的半个世纪当中，西北边疆省为反对英国人的压迫和殖民地的剥削，不断有人民蜂起和种族暴动的骚动发生。
    一九四七年当要把印度分为两个自治领进行准备的时候，培赞族深深地受到激动。边疆省中一个有力的农民组织“红衫党”，要求该省和印度境内所有其他有阿富汗居民的部分，成立一个独立邦——培赞斯坦。“红衫党”领袖要求举行公民投票。然而，英国当局不准，而且要把西北边疆省划为巴基斯坦的一部。
    现在英美帝国主义正利用培赞问题，来达成它们自己长远的计划。军事冲突不仅在英国自治领内部发生，巴基斯坦和阿富汗间也时有发生。起初印度分治的创始人，就存心使西北边疆省成为亚洲重要的政治焦点上底一个纠纷地区。现在煽动阿富汗和巴基斯坦间的仇恨，来开始实行这一部分计划。
    促使阿富汗与巴基斯坦关系恶化的第一件事，是去年一月间巴基斯坦飞机轰炸边境地区事件。阿富汗报纸大声抗议巴基斯坦当局故意发动武装进攻；并强调阿富汗人和培赞人的血统关系，要求培赞人决定自己未来的命运。巴基斯坦的报纸则对阿富汗同情培赞人成立培赞斯坦的要求，加以谴责。
    众所周知的，美国正在阿富汗增长其势力。美帝国主义在加强他们的控制权，并计划更进一步地渗入直到目前还是英国保有的各地区里面去。美国报纸鼓励卡贝尔（阿富汗首都——译者注）各界效法美国，并煽动为阿富汗人民所反对的反苏情绪。美英集团意欲利用阿富汗和巴基斯坦间的纠纷，达到其自己的帝国主义的意图，去年十二月在权威的美国“基督教科学箴言报”的一篇论文中，已暴露了这一点。这篇论文是以“美国在阿富汗势力增长着”得意洋洋的标题发表的，内中任意诬蔑说苏联已成为阿富汗的威胁。
    但是那些是真正威胁阿富汗的国家，不久被埃及报纸“安尼达”报揭发了。六月初，该报报导称，由于阿富汗政府打算废止它和美国建筑商“莫里逊·俄得森”公司的合同，使美阿关系面临着一个危机。（“莫里逊·俄得森”公司是在阿富汗国内从事军事和战略建筑工作的。）
    按照这家报纸的报导，阿富汗政府手中握有充分的书面证据，证明美国工程师对于摄贩阿富汗境内的照片与勘测矿藏，比他们正在监督的建设工作，更有兴趣得多。此外，这家公司的职员们。都忙于进行亲美宣传，努力向阿富汗人夸耀“美国制度的优越性”。阿富汗政府已经警惕到美国商人正在进行自己的、不正当的勾当。该报称，阿富汗政府决定拒绝这家公司所建议的新五年工作计划。
    这些事实显示出英美帝国主义对培赞人解放斗争的态度是多么彻底伪善。它们都装成培赞人的友人，甚至是他们独立的“战士”。实际上，它们却是要满足自己贪婪的欲望，要偷偷抓到主要地位的控制权，要在争议地区中设立基地，以及要扩展与巩固它们在那里的势力。
    阿富汗报纸说：培赞人举行大规模的反巴基斯坦的示威游行；巴基斯坦报纸、路透社、和英国广播却有另一种的说法，例如“辛德观察”报四月间报导称：奥拉克兹各酋长召集过各族的长者会议，抗议阿富汗广播中的反巴基斯坦宣传，决定与阿富汗断绝一切关系。
    事件还不限于口头上的互骂。六月十二日巴基斯坦飞机轰炸了阿富汗境内的一些村落。阿富汗政府则向巴基斯坦当局提出一强硬的抗议书。
    以英国为首的外国报纸宣传，军队业已集中于两国边境。据卡贝尔广播称，英国军官被派往西北边疆省，名义上是参加巴基斯坦的陆军演习。
    “曼澈斯特保卫报”急忙强调英国在阿富汗巴基斯坦争议中的权益。六月六日该报向巴基斯坦保证，倘若受到外来的袭击，它可以获得英帝国的支持。
    经过英美帝国主义的干涉，阿富汗巴基斯坦纠纷，已发展到有由外国调处的需要。据一家法国报纸的开罗通讯称，六月五日阿富汗驻埃及官员，曾向“阿拉伯联盟”主席巴沙要求该联盟出面在两国间进行调处。
    这种把戏已将阿富汗巴基斯坦关系弄得更形恶化。我们看来，这种把戏，把培赞族真正的民族利益丢在背后。帝国主义在把“培赞种族独立区”变成完全不同的一件事。
    英美垄断资本家的矛盾，并没有阻止住伦敦和华盛顿利用这块地区——在苏联边境附近——在侵略性的战略目的而进行长远计划上携手工作。这一点，在前西北边疆省省长凯罗于四月六日在伦敦皇家协会的演说中，已经十分清楚地透露出来了。当他对苏联给予许多粗野的攻击后，凯罗宣称：英国“用力量和外交”，在印度、巴基斯坦以及边疆省中保护帝国的权益，已经获得成功。他又说：
    “从伊斯坦堡到喀喇嗤甚至中东，也许应结成一个新集团，来维持这一地区的稳定。这不光是瓦兹斯坦、就是西北边疆省………要使其有效力，在这地区主要占有石油和交通权益的大西洋国家，就必须支持这样的一个集团。这地区的国家要供给基地，使有纵深的防卫。”
    从这些话里，我们明明白白得以证明，目前培赞问题的挑拨是和英美在亚洲取得基地有关系的。在阿富汗巴基斯坦纠纷背后，其实是帝国主义者要剥夺这个地区内各国名义上的独立，迫使他们参加服从于伦敦和华盛顿的集团。
    伦敦和华盛顿之玩弄培赞人民族情绪，只是要掩蔽他们所追求的真正目的。但他们的行动比辞令还要动人。
    如果英国告诉巴基斯坦，在和阿富汗武装冲突事件中，能够得到它的支持，华尔街的代理人就急忙向阿富汗政府提供他们的“军事援助”。
    “布烈兹”报驻德里记者在四月二十二日报导称，驻卡贝尔美国大使馆顾问曾向阿富汗国王提出一个协定草案，内中规定由美国在三年中派遣由三百名军官和专家组成的军事代表团，“协助”阿富汗陆军近代化。
    把这一协定强给阿富汗的美国帝国主义者，是老一套的办法。我们知道，为达到在伊朗获得陆军基地，与机场的目的，美帝也曾把一个协定强给德黑兰政府，规定它能够派遣它的军事的、行政的各种顾问到伊朗政府机关各部门中去，并抓到政治经济主要地位的控制权。
    阿富汗与巴基斯坦之间，无疑地能够以和平手段获得培赞问题的公平解决。但他们要能够这样做，英美的干涉必须停止。阿富汗巴基斯坦间的纠纷日益严重，是由帝国主义挑拨起来的，这对培赞人也好，阿富汗也好，巴基斯坦也好，都没有好。　　　　　　　　　　（译自一九四九年第二十六期新时代周刊）
