　　How Did We Complete the Production Task?
　　Communication Group of the First Sewing Department of the Clothing Factory
　　On the 23rd of last month, our First Sewing Department victoriously completed the first phase of winter clothing task of 62,500 sets. In the half-month period of the second phase task (August 26th to September 10th), we completed another 32,800 sets.

　　　　Braving the Challenge
　　The First Sewing Department has a total of ten classes, of which the first, second, third, and fifth are female worker classes. Except for the ninth class and the temporarily added tenth class, which use manual machines, all the others are electric. Each class has some fast hands, and the cutting department and the repair department are in the same factory as us, so it is convenient to change parts and repair machines nearby. Really, when it comes to strength, we are no weaker than any other sewing department. But when the task came down, everyone didn't have the heart to think about fighting a victorious battle, and only passively braced themselves to accept the challenges from other sub-associations.
　　The first phase of the emergency task was assigned on July 19th. 200,000 sets of cotton clothing were allocated to all the front sewing machines, and each person had to produce seven and a half sets per day, which was more than two sets higher than before. The quality also had to be guaranteed, and "knee pads" and "buttock patches" were added, which were more troublesome than in the past. At this time, the administration announced that it would change the old "staple food system" (a method implemented during the Kuomintang period, where every worker, whether excellent or poor, had the same fixed wage of 48 catties of rice per month) which hindered workers' production enthusiasm, to a full piece-rate wage system; and also changed the working hours to ten hours. At first, everyone was reluctant to accept these new things. The fast hands thought that the standard (seven sets) was set too high, and the wages were not relatively increased; the new work was not yet skilled, and the output was not high, so they were not satisfied. They said: "We would rather take care of the slow ones, we still want staple food." Needless to say, the slow hands were full of anger, saying strange things: "It's not as good as being a handyman!" Unfortunately, the first few days coincided with the repair of the factory building, and continuous rain made half of the workshops unable to work, delaying work for four days. At this time, everyone was worried about completing the task on schedule.

　　　　Breaking Through Difficulties
　　In response to this situation, the leaders separately explored and worked steadily: the branch called on party members to take the lead, the slow hands stepped up to improve their skills, and the fast hands helped others. Zhao Xiuqin of the first class, whom everyone called Auntie, worked overtime early and late, and also provided water and washbasins for everyone, taking care of everything thoughtfully. Liu Shuzhen of the third class and Liang Mancang of the fourth class were both well-known fast hands, and this time they worked even harder, explaining to everyone that the new wage system meant the more you do, the more you earn, and they worked happily and non-stop. The administration re-equipped the class leaders of each class, and went to the classes to mobilize the fast hands, explain the spirit of the new wage system, and encourage them to lead everyone to work. The trade union did its best to take care of the lives of the workers. In the past, buying things at the cooperative was crowded and time-consuming. Now, it is suggested that the cooperative register at the office when paying wages. This saves time, facilitates everyone, and ensures that they are not affected by price increases. The trade union also organized everyone to set labor discipline, ensuring that they go to work on time, do not play, do not visit other classes, save time and materials, take care of tools, and promote the spirit of unity and mutual assistance, etc. The first wages were paid, including both old and new wages. In the transition between the old and new systems, confusion was inevitable, but the leaders were prepared in advance, collected opinions, and negotiated solutions to take care of individual wages that were particularly low. During this period, the leaders worked in a consistent pace around production, laying a preliminary foundation for later production competitions.

　　　　A Surge in Production
　　With the help of the students working during the summer vacation, the trade union re-established the blackboard newspaper and used all its strength to cooperate with the production movement, achieving timely praise and criticism, and introducing experiences. The third class was the first to be encouraged, and the whole class was happy to be recognized. Afterwards, they worked even harder, even calculating the time to go to the toilet. The good cooperation between the assistant worker and the sewing machine operator, and between the sewing machine operator and the repairman, was also mentioned on the blackboard newspaper and praised. The blackboard newspaper said: "The close cooperation and unity of the sewing machine operator and assistant worker in the second class is much stronger than the fifth class." This attracted the attention of the fifth class. The sewing machine operators and assistant workers worked together, and the efficiency of the repairmen repairing the machines was also improved. If they couldn't finish repairing the machines, they would automatically work overtime.
　　Next to the blackboard newspaper was written the daily output table, and the output of the third class was increasing. The other female worker classes became anxious. They used to think that "we female workers can't compare to male workers, we can't even meet the standard even if we risk our lives," but now they said: "The third class is also a female worker class, they can be so good, why can't we?" The seventh class, which was not far behind the third class, rushed to set production plans, wanting to compete with the third class.

　　When the new full wage was paid for the second time, the third and seventh classes generally received 150-160 catties of millet, and the highest was 270 catties in half a month. In the past, the standard salary for a first-class worker was only 317 catties per month. The facts made it clearer to everyone, and they said: "It turns out that the piece-rate wage system is much more cost-effective than the 'staple food system'. The more you do, the more money you earn, it's very fair." "Let's work hard! We also want to be recognized on the blackboard newspaper." Each class was unwilling to fall behind and competed hard. More and more people voluntarily worked overtime, and the trade union quickly started to add a meal to protect the workers' health. There were many mosquitoes at night, so DDT was sprayed. Wow! This time, the production enthusiasm surged.

　　　　Competing for the Red Flag
　　After the news of awarding the red flag was announced on the blackboard newspaper, everyone's attention was focused on the daily production results. Everyone was very nervous when reporting the results every night, holding their breath and listening. Today the third class exceeded the seventh class, and tomorrow the seventh class would catch up. The experienced ninth class was also unwilling to lag behind and wanted to show the power of the manual machine, chase! Bury your head and chase hard, vowing not to give in. In order to cooperate with the leadership of the red flag competition, the responsible comrades of the Party, government, and trade union went to the four classes with poor results to help and encourage them. The Party branch secretary was assigned to the sixth class. She went to provide water for them at night and helped with the odd jobs of the assistant worker. The workers called her Big Sister, and the output of the sixth class increased significantly day by day. The responsible comrades of the administration and the trade union went to specifically help the first, second, and fifth classes, and as a result, these classes also made rapid progress. The total output was like a heated thermometer, rising straight up, with an average of seven or eight sets per day being commonplace. The fastest, Lü Zhaoying, could produce ten sets of work a day. Everyone's heart was shining with a red flag. In the days approaching the completion of the task, those who finished the work first helped those who had not finished. The third class helped the fourth class with forty sets, and the female worker class helped the male worker class to do work. This had never happened before.
　　We started work four days late, but completed the task two days earlier than the scheduled date. After resting for two days, we started the second phase of the task on August 26th. The workers were in high spirits, and everyone was determined to fight another victorious battle.

　　我们是怎样完成生产任务的？
    被服厂第一缝纫部通讯组
    上月二十三日，我们第一缝纫部胜利完成第一期冬装任务六万二千五百套，第二期任务开始的半个月期间（八月二十六至九月十日），又完成了三万二千八百套。
    　　　　硬着头皮应战
    第一缝纫部共有十个班，其中一、二、三、五是女工班。除第九班和临时添招的第十班是使用人力机外，其余全是电动机。每个班都有些快手，裁剪部和修理部又和我们同在一个厂内，要换片子、修机器，都有就近的便利。真的，说起实力来，我们比那一个缝纫部都不弱。可是任务一下来的时候，大伙儿都没心想到要打一个胜仗，只被动地硬着头皮应了其他分会的挑战。
    第一期紧急任务是七月十九日布置下来的，二十万套棉衣分配到所有的前车机上，每人每天得出七套半，这比从前高了两套多。还要保证质量好，添了护膝和臀部“补钉”，比过去麻烦多了。正在这时，行政上宣布要把旧的障碍工人生产积极性的“主食制”（国民党时期实行的办法，无论优秀工或泡匠每人每月都一样有四十八斤大米的固定工资）改为全面计件工资；又变更工时为十小时。开始大伙儿可不乐意接受这些新东西。快手认为标准（七套）订得高了，而工资并没有相对提高；新活一上手还没熟练，出活不多，不满意。他们说：“宁愿照顾慢的，我们还要主食。”慢手更不用说，满心是气，说怪话：“还不如小工了！”不巧，开头几天又赶上修厂房，连天下雨，半数的工房都漏得不能做活，延误了四天工。这时，大家对如期完成任务有些担心了。
    　　　　突破困难
    领导上针对着这种情况，分头摸索着踏踏实实地干：支部号召党员要带头，手慢的加紧提高技术，手快的要帮助别人。慢手的党员起早睡晚的加班，象一班的赵秀勤，大伙儿都管她叫大婶的，加完班还给大伙提水借脸盆，照顾得周周到到。三班刘淑珍，四班梁满仓都是有名的快手，这回更加劲干，一面给大家解释新工资是越多做越上算，一面高兴兴地干个紧手不停。行政上把各班班长重新配备了一番，又到班上去动员手快的，解释新工资的精神，鼓励他们去带动大家干。工会方面用全力照顾工友们的生活，合作社过去买东西拥挤，费时间，现在建议合作社在发工资的时候到办公室去登记，这一来既省时间，又便利大家，还保证了不受物价影响。工会又组织大伙订劳动纪律，保证按时上下班、不玩耍、不串班、省时节料、爱护工具、发扬团结互助精神等十二条。第一次工资发下来，有旧工资也有新工资，在新旧制度交替当中，必不可免的要发生混乱，领导上却先有准备，收集意见，协商出办法来照顾个别工资特别少的。这段时间，领导上步调一致地围绕着生产做工作，给后来生产竞赛打下了初步的基础。
    　　　　生产热潮起来了
    在暑期工作的同学们帮助下，工会又把黑板报重新搞起来，用全力配合生产运动，做到及时表扬与批评，并介绍经验。象三班是首先受到鼓励的，这一露脸全班都乐了。以后干活更起劲，连上厕所的时间都要计算一下。副工和车工，车工和修理工之间工作配合得好，也提到黑板报上去表扬，黑板报说：“二班车工和副工的密切配合，团结互助可比五班强多了。”这一下引起了五班的注意，车工、副工合着劲干，修理工修理机子的效率也提高了，修不完机子就自动加夜班。
    黑板报旁边写着每天的产量表，三班的产量越来越多。其他女工班着急起来了，从前以为“我们女工可比不了男工，命拼出去也达不到标准”的，现在却说：“三班也是女工班，能那样好，我们为什么不能？”和三班不相上下的七班，各人都赶着订生产计划，要和三班争个高下。
    第二次开全新工资时，三班、七班普遍都开一百五六十斤小米，最高有半月得二百七十斤的，过去甲等工标准薪一个月才有三百十七斤，事实更让大家明白了，纷纷在说：“原来计件工资比‘主食制’合算得多，多做就多挣钱，很公平。”“加油干吧！我们也要在黑板报上露露脸。”各班都不愿落后，使劲赛着。自动加班的越来越多，工会赶紧着手加添一顿伙食，保护工人身体健康。夜晚蚊子多，给打ＤＤＴ。嗬！这下子生产热潮高涨起来了。
    　　　　争红旗
    要奖红旗的消息在黑板报上宣布以后，大伙的注意力都集中到每天的生产成绩上了。每晚报成绩时，大家都很紧张，屏住气听。今天三班超过七班，明天七班就追上去。老手的九班也不甘心，要大显人力机的能耐，追！埋头使劲追，誓不相让。党、政、工负责同志为了配合领导红旗赛，分头到四个成绩较差的班去帮助、打气。党支书分配到六班，她晚上去给他们提水，帮着做副工的零碎活，工友管她叫大姐，六班产量一天天显著地提高了。行政和工会负责同志去具体帮助一、二、五班，结果这几个班进步也很快。全部产量就象受热的寒暑表一样，直往上升，每天平均七、八套已是常事了。最快的吕兆英一天能出十套活。人人心里都闪耀着一面红旗，在接近完成任务的日子，先完活的都帮着没完的做，三班就帮四班作了四十套，女工班帮男工做活，这在过去是从没有过的事。
    我们迟开了四天工，却比规定日期早两天完成了任务。休息两天后，就在八月二十六日开始第二期任务。工人们情绪饱满，大伙都决心再打一个胜仗。
