Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 23rd. TASS reports on the scene at Flushing Meadow on the 20th, when the Fourth Session of the United Nations General Assembly opened: As in previous sessions, the Soviet delegation, led by Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky, attracted attention. Photographers constantly swarmed around the Soviet delegation. The television camera focused on the Soviet delegation for a long time.

The Australian representative, Makin, delivered a brief opening speech on behalf of the President of the previous session, Australian Foreign Minister Evatt. Makin's speech was a generality, but it reflected the fear of economic crisis, which is increasingly being felt by capitalist countries.

The next procedure for the General Assembly was to elect the President of the Assembly and the Chairmen of the six committees of the Assembly. Although the election of the President of the Assembly was conducted by secret ballot without prior nomination of candidates, it was well known that the American representatives stubbornly wanted to elect the Philippine representative, Romulo, as President. Romulo is known in the United Nations General Assembly for his hypocritical propaganda and obedience in carrying out the orders of the American delegation. The press pointed out that many advisors to the American delegation had worked hard to garner votes for their protégé. Therefore, no one was surprised when Romulo was announced as the elected President of the Assembly. The Soviet Union, the Ukrainian Republic, the Byelorussian Republic, Poland, and Czechoslovakia voted for Czech Foreign Minister Clementis.

At the subsequent meetings of the various committees, the list of elected committee chairmen is as follows: Chairman of the First Committee (Political Security): Pearson of Canada; Chairman of the Second Committee (Economic and Financial): Cruz of Chile; Chairman of the Third Committee (Social, Humanitarian and Cultural): Stoopke of Venezuela; Chairman of the Fourth Committee (Trusteeship): Lannung of Denmark; Chairman of the Fifth Committee (Administrative and Budgetary): Ghyrou of Greece; Chairman of the Sixth Committee (Legal): Lachs of Poland.

As a result of the vote, the positions of Vice-Presidents of the General Assembly were given to the delegations of the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, China (Kuomintang), Brazil, and Pakistan.

After the election of the officers of the General Assembly, the Assembly adjourned. The general discussion is scheduled to begin on the 21st at the plenary session of the United Nations General Assembly. The Steering Committee is also scheduled to hold its first meeting on the same day. The Steering Committee consists of the President of the Assembly (one person), the Vice-Presidents (seven people), and the Chairmen of the Committees (six people).

　　联大会议进行选举
    美帝操纵傀儡罗慕洛当选大会主席         
    六个委员会主席均已选出
    【新华社北平二十三日电】塔斯社记者报道联合国大会第四届会议于二十日在佛拉辛草地开幕时的情形称：和从前几届大会时一样，由苏联外长维辛斯基率领的苏联代表团，吸引了人们的注意。摄影记者们不断麇集在苏联代表团的周围。电视镜头在一个长时间内照着苏联代表团。
    澳大利亚代表梅金代表前届大会主席澳外长伊瓦特致简短的开会词。梅金的演词是一篇泛泛之论，但它反映出对于经济危机的恐惧，因为经济危机的到来，正日益为资本主义国家所感受到了。
    大会下面的程序是进行大会主席及大会六个委员会主席的选举。虽然大会主席的选举，系在事前并不提出候选人的的情况下由秘密投票方式进行的，但是，尽人皆知：美国代表们固执地要选举菲律宾代表罗慕洛担任主席。罗慕洛在联合国大会中以其虚伪的宣传及遵从执行美国代表团的命令而出名。新闻界方面指出：美国代表团的许多顾问们，曾尽力为他们所庇护的人运动选票。所以，当发表罗慕洛当选为大会主席时，没有一个人感到惊讶。苏联、乌克兰共和国、白俄罗斯共和国、波兰及捷克斯洛伐克投票选举捷外长克里门蒂斯。
    在随后举行的各委员会会议上，当选的委员会主席的名单如下：第一委员会（政治安全）主席为加拿大的皮尔逊；第二委员会（经济及财政）主席为智利的克鲁兹；第三委员会（社会人道及文化）主席为委内瑞拉的史涛普克；第四委员会（托管）主席为丹麦的蓝农；第五委员会（行政及预算）主席为希腊的吉鲁；第六委员会（法律）主席为波兰的拉克斯。
    票选的结果，大会副主席的职位给予苏联、美国、英国、法国、中国（国民党）、巴西及巴基斯坦的代表团。
    在选出大会的官员之后，大会会议即告散会。一般讨论定于二十一日在联合国大会全会上开始。指导委员会亦定于同一天举行首次会议。指导委员会由大会主席（一人）、副主席（七人）及各委员会主席（六人）组成。
