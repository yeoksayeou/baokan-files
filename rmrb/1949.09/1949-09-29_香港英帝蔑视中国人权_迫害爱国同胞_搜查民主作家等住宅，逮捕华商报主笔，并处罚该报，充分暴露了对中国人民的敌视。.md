Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 28th: Hong Kong dispatch: The British authorities in Hong Kong are intensifying their persecution of patriotic and democratic Chinese individuals in Hong Kong. On the same day that General Yang Jie, a specially invited representative to the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), was brutally assassinated by Kuomintang bandit secret agents, that is, at noon on the 19th of this month, Hong Kong police suddenly searched the residence of Chinese democratic writer Song Yunbin, and confiscated the return-to-China documents of CPPCC representative Hu Yuzhi from Nanyang, claiming that possessing this item was illegal. After General Yang Jie was assassinated, the British authorities in Hong Kong not only did not effectively pursue the Kuomintang murderers, but instead took the opportunity to persecute Chinese democratic individuals on a large scale. At 1:00 AM on the 20th, Hong Kong police, using the excuse that they found a letter from He Yaozu, who had already announced his departure from the Kuomintang reactionary camp, at General Yang Jie's residence, searched He's residence and interrogated him for as long as two hours. At 4:15 AM on the same day, a British special agent police officer led nine Hong Kong policemen to break into the residence of Zhang Tiesheng, the chief editor of the "China Business Daily." Without explaining the reason or showing any documents, they forcibly searched the residence for as long as an hour. When Zhang questioned them, the British man and the Hong Kong police were extremely rude, claiming that they were special police and did not need a "warrant." After searching the entire house without finding anything, the British man and the Hong Kong police unreasonably took Zhang to the Bonham Road Police Station. At the police station, they first forced Zhang to give his fingerprints before saying, "Yang Jie was assassinated, so we brought you here. We will ask you again tomorrow. Go to the detention center first." At 11:00 AM on the 20th, Zhang was sent to the Political Department and interrogated for as long as four hours. However, the questions about the Yang Jie case took only a few minutes, and the questions asked were all general in nature. The next day, the 21st, the Hong Kong British government's High Court opened a trial against the "China Business Daily" for "contempt of court." The "reason" was that the "China Business Daily" published news reports of British soldiers raping Chinese women in the New Territories, and included statements from the victims, which "disturbed the judges' hearing and hindered the trial." The British government court unreasonably demanded that the "China Business Daily" publish an apology for publishing this news exposing the crimes of the British imperialists. After the "China Business Daily" refused, the court immediately fined the newspaper 4,000 yuan. The next day, all the English newspapers in Hong Kong published the news in large print. These reactionary measures by the British authorities in Hong Kong fully expose the British aggressors' hostility towards the Chinese people.

　　香港英帝蔑视中国人权
  　迫害爱国同胞
    搜查民主作家等住宅，逮捕华商报主笔，并处罚该报，
    分暴露了对中国人民的敌视。
    【新华社北京二十八日电】香港讯：香港英国当局正加紧迫害在港中国爱国民主人士。与中国人民政治协商会议特邀代表杨杰将军惨遭国民党匪帮特务暗杀同日，即本月十九日中午，香港警察突然搜查中国民主作家宋云彬住宅，并将人民政协代表胡愈之自南洋返国证件搜去，声称藏此物系犯法。杨杰将军被暗杀后，香港英国当局不但不切实追缉国民党杀人凶手，反而乘机向中国民主人士大肆迫害。二十日上午一时，香港警察借口在杨杰将军住宅中发见有业已宣布脱离国民党反动阵营的贺耀组的约见函，搜查贺氏住宅并盘问达两小时之久。同日午前四时一刻，一英人特务警察又率领港警九人闯入华商报主笔张铁生的住宅，既不说明理由，亦无证件，强行搜查达一小时之久。张氏当提出责问，而该英人及港警竟态度极其蛮横，声称他们系特殊警察，用不着“花令纸”。在搜查全宅毫无所获后，英人及港警又无理地将张氏带至般含道警察局。至警局后，首先强迫张氏打指模，然后才说：“杨杰被暗杀，为此传你来。明天再问，先进拘留所。”二十日上午十一时，张氏又被送到政治部，并被盘问达四小时之久。但盘问中，有关杨杰案者不过十数分钟，且所问者，皆属一般性问题。次日，即二十一日，香港英国政府高等法庭又开庭控告华商报“藐视法庭”，其“理由”是华商报登载了报道英军强奸新界中国妇女的消息，并附有被害者的自述，“扰乱法官视听、妨碍审判”。英政府法庭无理地要华商报对登载这一揭露英帝国主义者罪行的新闻登报道歉，经华商报拒绝后，该法庭即判处该报罚金四千元。第二天香港各英文报纸并以大字刊载该项消息。香港英国当局这种种反动措施充分暴露了英国侵略者对于中国人民的敌意。
