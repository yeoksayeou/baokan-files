　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 26th: TASS, New York: Under the call of the "Joint Committee to Protest the Peekskill Atrocities," a delegation of 500 union representatives went to the New York State Legislature on the 21st to protest Dewey's shameless attempt to whitewash the fascist atrocities in Peekskill, and demanded the dismissal of the negligent prosecutor. The demonstrators marched in formation on the streets and then held a mass demonstration in front of the State Legislature. The delegation also sent former Undersecretary of Justice Rogge and Labor Party's Ross to meet with Dewey, but Dewey dared not meet with the delegation and fled to New York in advance. Rogge fiercely criticized this. On the same day, under mass pressure, the US House of Representatives was forced to hold a brief discussion on the Peekskill atrocities. When Rankin, a notorious reactionary Congressman from Mississippi, used insulting language against blacks to attack Robertson, he was immediately strongly protested by Labor Party Congressman Marcantonio.

　　美职工代表发动示威抗议毕克斯吉尔暴行
    【新华社北平二十六日电】塔斯社纽约讯：在“抗议毕克斯吉尔暴行联合委员会”号召下，由五百人组成的职工代表团，二十一日赴纽约州议会抗议杜威洗刷毕克斯吉尔法西斯暴行的无耻企图，并要求将失职检察官革职。示威者在大街上列队前进，然后在州议会面前举行群众性示威。代表团并派前司法部次长罗齐和劳工党罗斯等往见杜威，但杜威不敢接见代表团，事先逃往纽约，罗齐当对此猛加抨击。同日，美国众院在群众压力下被迫举行关于毕克斯吉尔暴行的简短讨论中，密士失必州臭名昭彰的反动众议员兰金用侮辱黑人的言词攻击罗伯逊时，立即遭到劳工党众议员马肯托尼奥的强烈抗议。
