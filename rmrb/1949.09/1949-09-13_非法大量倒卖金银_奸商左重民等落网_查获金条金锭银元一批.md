　　Illegal Large-Scale Profiteering in Gold and Silver
　　Leftist Zuo Chongmin and Others Arrested
　　A Batch of Gold Bars, Gold Ingots, and Silver Dollars Seized
　　[This Municipality News] The Yongshengheng Cloth Shop in this city has been found to be illegally profiteering in gold and silver dollars, and the main perpetrators have been sent to court for punishment. The shop, located at No. 22, Lower Fourth Alley, Changxiang, District Eight, has been using the legitimate facade of a cloth shop to conduct large-scale gold and silver dollar profiteering activities since February of this year. After learning of the shop's illegal activities, the Beiping Branch of the People's Bank of China, in coordination with the First Division of the Public Security Bureau, went to the shop for inspection on August 29. The shop had only twenty bolts of white cloth, with very little cloth business transactions. The eighteen account books were filled with gold and silver dollar transaction figures. Seven taels and four qian of gold, 277 silver dollars, and 1,090,000 People's Bank Yuan used for buying and selling gold and silver were found on the spot (according to the shop's accountant, Liu Zhen). The shop's manager, Zuo Chongmin, deputy manager Zhang Yimin, runner Zhang Ying, accountant Liu Zhen, and all material evidence were taken to the branch for interrogation. The manager and deputy manager were very cunning and refused to reveal the truth, attempting to deny the facts. Following the information provided by accountant Liu Zhen, on the 30th, eleven gold bars (each bar weighing ten taels), 29 gold bracelets, 39 gold ingots, 28 gold rings, two earrings, and 228 silver dollars were found in the manager's office basement. Furthermore, 2,000 miscellaneous silver dollars were found in the dormitory room of an employee.
　　According to the shop's current account statistics, from April 27 to August 29, gold income was recorded in 59 entries, totaling 123 taels, two qian, nine fen, and five li; payments were recorded in 77 entries, totaling 139 taels, four qian, nine fen, and five li. From April 16 to July 20, silver dollar income was recorded in 48 entries, totaling 5,160 coins; expenditures were recorded in 101 entries, totaling 4,515 coins. In transactions with various places, a total of 2,255 silver dollars and 35 taels of gold were purchased, and a total of 1,033 silver dollars and 15 taels of gold were sold.
　　Based on the above facts, it is proven that since the liberation of Beiping, the shop has been engaged in illegal activities of reselling gold and silver dollars under the guise of a legitimate cloth shop, disrupting financial order, endangering people's lives, and violating the decrees of the People's Government against illegal financial activities. In order to safeguard the interests of the people, stabilize the financial situation, and severely punish illegal speculators, it has been decided to send the main perpetrators, Zuo Chongmin, Zhang Yimin, and others, to the court for trial.

　　非法大量倒卖金银
　  奸商左重民等落网
　  查获金条金锭银元一批
    【本市讯】本市永升恒布庄非法大量倒卖黄金银元被查获，主犯人员已送法院惩办。该号开设八区长巷下四条二十二号，自今年二月迄今，一直在布庄的合法面貌掩饰下，大量倒卖黄金银元，进行非法投机活动。中国人民银行北平分行于获悉该号之非法活动后，乃于八月二十九日配合公安局外一分局前往该号检查，该号仅有白布二十匹，布帐来往甚少，十八本帐簿中满载黄金银元交易数字。当场并查出黄金七两四钱，银元二百七十七枚，买卖金银用人民券一百零九万元（据该号司帐刘真供认）。当即将该号经理左重民、副经理张义民、跑街张英、司帐刘真及一切物证带往分局审讯。该经理、副经理等十分狡诈，不肯吐露实情，企图抵赖。继根据司帐刘真所供，三十日又先后在经理室地下查出黄金十一条（每条计十两）、金镯子二十九个、金锭三十九个、金戒指二十八个、耳环二个、银元二百二十八枚，又由伙友宿舍室内查出杂牌银元二千枚。
    根据该号流水帐内统计，由四月二十七日至八月二十九日，黄金收入五十九笔，共一百二十三两二钱九分五厘；支付七十七笔，共一百三十九两四钱九分五厘。由四月十六日至七月二十日统计，银元收入四十八笔，共五千一百六十枚，支出一百零一笔，共四千五百十五枚。与各地来往中，共收购银元二千二百五十五枚，黄金三十五两，共售出银元一千零三十三枚，黄金十五两。
    根据以上事实证明，该号自北平解放后，即一直在布庄的合法名义掩护下，专事倒卖黄金、银元的非法活动，扰乱金融，危害人民生活，违犯人民政府取缔非法金融活动的法令。为维护人民利益，稳定金融，严惩非法投机分子，决将该案主犯左重民、张义民等人送法院讯办。
