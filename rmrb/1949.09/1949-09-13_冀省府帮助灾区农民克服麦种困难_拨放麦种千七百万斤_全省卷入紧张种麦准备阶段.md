The Hebei Provincial Government Helps Farmers in Disaster Areas Overcome Wheat Seed Difficulties
　Allocates 17 Million Jin of Wheat Seeds
　The Entire Province Enters a Stage of Intense Wheat Planting Preparation

[Our Newspaper’s Report] In order to provide relief to farmers in the province's flood-stricken areas and help solve the difficulties of autumn wheat sowing, the Hebei Provincial Government has issued 15 million jin of wheat seeds to be distributed by various special districts for loans to farmers in disaster areas for wheat planting. This batch of wheat seeds includes 5 million jin from the provincial government's wheat loans, 5 million jin of fine grains saved by cadres at all levels throughout the province for disaster relief, and 5 million jin from the provincial cooperative fund, which will be lent out together with the 2 million jin of wheat seeds allocated by the North China People's Government to Hebei Province for emergency relief.

[Baoding Telegraph] Currently, the autumn harvest season has arrived. Party and government leading organs in various parts of Hebei Province are mobilizing farmers to use all means to plant wheat on a large scale in order to shorten the spring famine next year and lay the foundation for providing food supplies as soon as possible. After the Hebei Provincial Government issued instructions on production for disaster relief on August 11, the four special districts of Tangshan, Tianjin, Tongxian, and Cangxian in the flood-stricken area have been grasping the leadership of the masses and vigorously draining water. The Tongxian Prefectural Committee and Administrative Office have transferred 76 cadres to various counties to help with the work. In Shunyi County's second district alone, 70,000 mu were freed from waterlogging after drainage. In Jixian County, digging ditches for drainage has made it possible for most of the land to avoid delaying wheat planting. Regarding the seed problem, various localities have launched private lending (such as in six villages including Gaomiao in Jixian County, where more than 9,000 jin of wheat seeds have been prepared through mutual assistance and lending among the masses), and the government has also provided seed loans to help. The Tongxian Special District alone has loaned 500,000 jin of seeds. The Tangshan and other special districts have also paid attention to educating farmers on seed soaking methods to prevent the occurrence of black and yellow jaundice diseases next year and to make the wheat seeds easier to germinate. Non-flood-stricken areas have decided not to plant wheat in areas suitable for cotton production, to plant more wheat in areas suitable for wheat production, and to strive to plant cotton instead of wheat in areas suitable for both cotton and wheat. Wheat planting requires a focus on processing and fertilization, improving technology, and increasing yields. In order to free up land for wheat planting as soon as possible, farmers in the Handan and other special districts have universally launched a movement to remove weeds and cut artemisia. In Handan County alone, from August 7th to 14th, more than 700,000 jin of artemisia were cut. The Xingtai Special District has prepared more than 112,300 jin of five excellent varieties such as "Guangzong White" and "Fish Scale White," as well as more than 2,500 jin of insecticides, which are sold to farmers at low prices. Currently, farmers in various places are actively deep plowing and reserving wheat land. In the midst of intense preparations, all localities have paid attention to the difficulties of revolutionary martyrs’ families, military families, workers’ families, and households without labor, and have guaranteed that wheat seeds will be delivered on time. Regardless of whether it is a disaster area or a non-disaster area, economic departments such as the People's Bank of China branches, trade companies, and local supply and marketing cooperatives are transferring large quantities of wheat seeds, fertilizers, and arsenic to help farmers prepare for wheat planting. The Cangxian Special District People's Bank allocated 880,000 jin of coarse grains to exchange for wheat seeds to be loaned to disaster victims lacking seeds, and established a 5 million yuan overdraft relationship with various county supply and marketing cooperatives to support production in disaster areas. The state-owned Yudong Store actively transferred, purchased, and exchanged more than 1.1 million jin of the excellent variety "Yise White." The Hengshui Supply and Marketing Cooperative shipped 40,000 jin of bean cake and 3,000 jin of arsenic from Tianjin and sold them below market prices. Currently, Party and government leading organs and cadres at all levels throughout the province, in addition to grasping the autumn harvest, have listed the preparation work for wheat planting in the "Three Autumns" movement as the main content of the current central work.

　　冀省府帮助灾区农民克服麦种困难
　  拨放麦种千七百万斤
    全省卷入紧张种麦准备阶段
    【本报讯】河北省政府为救济全省水灾地区农民，帮助解决秋麦播种困难，已发下麦种一千五百万斤，分配各专署贷出以备灾区农民种麦。此批麦种中包括省府麦贷五百万斤，全省各级干部节约下来救灾的五百万斤细粮和省合作社基金五百万斤，将连同华北人民政府拨交冀省急赈麦种二百万斤一并贷出。
    【保定电】目前秋收已届，河北省各地党、政领导机关，为缩短明年春荒，早日打下接济粮食，发动农民利用一切办法，大量种麦。河北省政府于八月十一日发出生产救灾指示后，水灾区唐山、天津、通县、沧县等四个专区，抓紧领导群众大力排水。通县地委、专署抽调干部七十六人，分赴各县帮助工作。仅顺义县二区，经排水后即脱出七万亩。蓟县挖沟排水，绝大部分土地可不误种麦。关于种籽问题，各地发动了私人借贷（如蓟县高庙等六村，在群众互助借贷下，已准备好麦种九千余斤），政府并贷种帮助，仅通县专署即贷种五十万斤。唐山等专区并注意了教育农民浸种方法，以预防明年黑、黄疸病的发生，和使麦种易于发苗。非水灾区则决定适宜产棉地不种麦，适宜种麦地多种麦，适宜种棉又适宜种麦地大量争取种棉不种麦。种麦要求以加工施肥、改良技术、增加产量为主。邯郸等专区为早日腾出地好种麦，农民普遍展开铲草、割蒿运动。仅邯郸县自八月七日至十四日，即割蒿七十余万斤。邢台专署已筹备优良品种“广宗白”、“鱼鳞白”等五种共十一万二千三百余斤，及杀虫药剂二千五百余斤，廉价卖给农民。现各地农民正积极深耕留麦地。各地在紧张准备中，都注意了烈、军、工属及无劳动力户的困难，保证按时把麦种上。无论灾区与非灾区，人民银行各分支行、贸易公司等经济部门及各地供销社，均大量调运麦种、肥料、信石等，帮助农民准备种麦。沧县专区人民银行拨出八十八万斤粗粮换成麦种，准备贷给缺乏种籽的灾民，并与各县供销社建立五百万元的透支关系，作为扶助灾区生产之用。国营裕东商店积极调运、购、换优良品种“一色白”一百余万斤。衡水供销社由天津运到豆饼四万斤、信石三千斤，低于市价出售。现全省各级党政领导机关及干部，除抓紧秋收外，对“三秋”运动中种麦之准备工作，已列为当前中心工作之主要内容。
