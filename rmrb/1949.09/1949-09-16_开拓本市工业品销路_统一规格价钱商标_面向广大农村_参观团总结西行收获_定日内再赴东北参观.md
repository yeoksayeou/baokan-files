　　Expand Sales of Industrial Products in This City
  　Standardize Specifications, Prices, and Trademarks
  　Target the Vast Rural Areas
    Visiting Group Summarizes Gains from Western Trip
  　Scheduled to Visit Northeast Again Within Days

    [This City News] The Peiping Industrial Visiting Group, which departed on August 24th and visited Zhangjiakou, Datong, Chengde, Fengzhen, Zhuolu, and other major industrial and commercial towns in the Northwest, returned to Peiping on September 8th. Yesterday (the 15th) at 4:00 PM, a meeting was held at the City Industry Association to summarize the gains from this trip.

    At the meeting, Shi Fuxiang, the head of the visiting group, first reported on the economic situation (raw materials, finished products, and industry and commerce) in various places. He then explained the gains of this trip: In all the places visited, the local administrative leaders, chambers of commerce, and heads of various industries enthusiastically provided materials and exchanged opinions. Especially in order to further promote Peiping-Zhangjiakou trade, five principles were agreed upon with Zhangjiakou (see page 4, top story of the September 11th issue of this newspaper). Finally, Mr. Shi, addressing the situation in the Northwest market, put forward several points that the Peiping industrial sector should pay attention to in the future: First, the Northwest is a market for Peiping industrial products. Therefore, Peiping should standardize the specifications, prices, and trademarks of its products to make it easier for farmers to purchase them. Furthermore, product inspection should be strengthened to ensure excellent quality. Second, establish normal trade relations with various places in the Northwest (according to the five agreed principles). Third, print samples of Peiping's industrial products and send them to the Northwest to facilitate local procurement. Fourth, the Northwest is rich in resources. Capitalists can invest in development in the Northwest and can also engage in the processing of agricultural products such as oil extraction and starch production, which will facilitate transportation and reduce the cost of industrial products.

    Subsequently, representatives from the machinery industry, soap and alkali manufacturing industry, leather industry, and fur industry reported on the raw materials and production situations in the Northwest, in the order of their respective industries. They unanimously expressed that Peiping industrial products can only develop by targeting the rural areas of the Northwest. Currently, Zhangjiakou Jianye Store has come to Peiping to negotiate the purchase of soap and intends to sign contracts with three soap companies, Huaxing (White Light Brand), Youxin (Five Flower Brand), and Lizhong (Triangle Brand) (totaling about 150 boxes). The Peiping soap industry, which has been experiencing overproduction, is gradually improving in terms of sales. Zhuolu, which is rich in rice production, needs various machines. After the Peiping Industrial Visiting Group arrived in the county, the county people's government and business community were very welcoming and requested that the Peiping machinery industry quickly send samples for ordering. Xinfu Iron Factory is currently negotiating with merchants in the county to order more than 20 rice threshers, one diesel engine, five coarse rice milling machines, and one fine rice milling machine.

    Currently, the Peiping industrial sector has realized the importance of visiting other places. Therefore, it was proposed at the meeting that during the Dalian Industrial Exhibition, the Peiping Industrial Visiting Group should first visit the Northeast (originally planned to go to Taiyuan after returning from Zhangjiakou). It was also decided that the board of directors of the Industry Association will elect members of the visiting group's preparatory committee today (the 16th) to make adequate preparations before the trip.

　　开拓本市工业品销路
  　统一规格价钱商标
  　面向广大农村       
    参观团总结西行收获
  　定日内再赴东北参观
    【本市讯】北平市工业参观团自八月二十四日出发参观了张家口、大同、承德、丰镇、涿鹿等西北各工商重镇，于九月八日返平。昨天（十五日）下午四时在市工业会开会总结此行收获。
    会上，参观团团长施复湘首先报告各地的经济情况（原料、成品、及工商业），继说明此行收获：凡到过的地方，当地行政首长、商会、各行业负责人均热诚的提供材料，交换意见。尤其为了进一步的促进平张贸易，更和张家口定了五项原则性的协议（见十一日本报四版头条）。最后，施氏又针对西北市场的情况，提出今后北平工业界应注意的几点意见：一、西北是北平工业品的市场，因此，北平应将产品的规格、价钱、商标等统一化，使农民便于采购；并应加强商品检查，使品质优良。二、和西北各地建立正常贸易关系（按五项协议原则）。三、将北平的工业产品，印成样本，送到西北，以便于该地采购。四、西北物资丰富，资本家可在西北投资开发，更可经营榨油、淀粉等农业品的加工，这样能便于运输，减低工业品的成本。
    继由机器业、造胰制碱业、皮革业、皮毛业等代表，按其行业先后报告西北的原料和生产品情况，一致表示：只有面向西北农村，北平工业品才有发展。现张家口建业商店已来平接洽购买肥皂，拟与华兴（白光牌）又新（五花牌）利中（三角牌）等三肥皂公司签订合同（共约一百五十箱）。生产过剩的北平肥皂业，在销路上已渐趋好转。盛产稻米的涿鹿正需要各种机器，北平工业参观团到该县后，县人民政府及商界均非常欢迎，请北平机器业速去样本，以便订制。信孚铁工厂正与该县商人洽商订制打稻机二十余架，柴油机一架，粗米机五架，细米机一架。
    现在，北平工业界对于到外地参观，已感到其重要性，因此会上提出在大连市工业展览会期间，北平工业参观团先赴东北参观（原计划由张家口回来后到太原），并定今日（十六日）由工业会理监事会选出参观团筹委会委员，以作行前充足的准备。
