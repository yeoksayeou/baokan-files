Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 15th: TASS, New York dispatch: The American Progressive Party held a grand banquet in New York on September 12th to commemorate the third anniversary of Wallace's famous speech in Madison Square Garden, in which he criticized America's Cold War policy and called for US-Soviet cooperation. More than 1,000 people attended the banquet, including Progressive Party leaders and activists, trade union workers, cultural figures, and freelancers.  Compass editor Sacre, American Labor Party leader Marcantonio, and famous singer Robeson all delivered speeches at the banquet.

	Wallace delivered a speech fiercely criticizing the Truman government, calling it the "destroyer of Roosevelt's policies." He said: America is now becoming a police state, civil rights are being sold out, citizens are being illegally sent to prison, black people are forced to live in fear of persecution, and large numbers of people are losing their jobs because of race, religious belief, and party affiliation.

	Wallace then vigorously stated: The Progressive Party must build and organize itself to win the support of the broad masses of the American people. The development of the situation is beneficial to the Progressive Party. The broad masses of people in the world who urgently seek peace are on our side. At the same time, as their illusions are about to be shattered, the American people will also leave the old parties and turn to us.

　　抨斥杜鲁门反动政府把美国变成警察国家
    【新华社北平十五日电】塔斯社纽约讯：美国进步党于九月十二日在纽约举行盛大宴会，纪念华莱士在麦迪逊广场发表抨击美国冷战政策并号召美苏合作的著名演说三周年。赴宴者有进步党领袖与积极分子，工会工作者，文化界人士及自由职业者共一千余人，指南针日报编辑萨克雷、美劳工党领袖马肯托尼奥，及著名歌唱家罗伯逊，都在宴会上发表演说。
    华莱士发表演说猛烈抨击杜鲁门政府，称之为“罗斯福政策的破坏者”。他说：美国现在正变成一个警察国家，民权正被出卖，公民们被非法送进监狱，黑人被迫生活在遭迫害的恐惧中，大批人们因种族、宗教信仰及党派而失掉职业。
    华莱士接着力称：进步党必须建设和组织起来，以赢得美国广大人民的支持，时局的发展是有利于进步党的。世界上迫切企求和平的广大民是站在我们这一边的。同时美国人民在他们幻想即告破灭中，也将离开旧政党而投向我们。
