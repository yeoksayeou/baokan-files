　　“Borrowing a Corpse to Resurrect the Soul”

　　The executioners' actions are always exceptionally rare and different from ordinary people; otherwise, wouldn't they be "ashamed" of their ancestor Hitler? Please look at these two news items:
　　According to reports: "When the Qing Ma bandit gang retreated and fled from Yuzhong on August 13th, they looted the coffin of Genghis Khan, his portrait, dressing mirror, and other items stored in the Xinglong East Mountain Great Buddha Hall north of the county seat." The newsletter "The Northwest Corner Under the Rule of the Hu Ma Bandit Gang" published in today's newspaper also reveals the following facts: When the Ma bandits ruled Hexi, they shot more than 30 peasant leaders who resisted paying grain to the government in Jiuquan with firearms, and then "displayed their corpses to the public"; When the Red Army passed through Hexi in those years, many people captured by the Ma bandits were burned alive in large pits by him; During the peasant riots in Longshang, several thousand peasants were disemboweled and executed by the Ma bandits. The punishments were extremely cruel, in addition to shooting, burying alive, burning, and beheading, there were also "live skinning" and "lighting human oil lamps" and other tricks.
　　This contrast of facts can be described as extremely clear! This Northwest "local emperor" Ma Bufang, even in his retreat and escape, still "filially" looted the coffin of Genghis Khan, who had been dead for hundreds of years, but treated the millions of peasants who supported him so rudely, hating them for living "not pleasing to the eye," killing them alive; and even finding their deaths "not painful enough," adding to them disembowelment, skinning, and other severe tortures. This is naturally not accidental, but precisely the inherent nature these "local emperors" brought from their mothers' wombs.
　　However, whether it is killing living people or looting corpses, it is all for the sake of maintaining his "throne."
　　Everyone knows that the Ma Bufang bandit gang started by looting and robbing homes, and the Ma Hongkui bandit gang started by his father "escorting Empress Dowager Cixi during her escape"; later, they prospered by relying on the bandit leader Chiang Kai-shek, occupying a corner of the Northwest; Now that the Chiang bandit has fled to Taiwan and is unable to take care of himself, and Taiwan is far away from the Northwest, with no hope of reliance, and the people of the Northwest have long hated them to the bone; Therefore, under the spearhead of the People's Liberation Army, the Ma bandit gang feels that "the deep pool is dry, and the solid rock is broken!" They had no choice but to pick up the already decaying coffin of Genghis Khan as a magic weapon for "borrowing a corpse to resurrect the soul."
　　Because Genghis Khan (Emperor Taizu of Yuan) is a historical figure with influence among the people in the Northwest, the Ma bandits' "escorting" the coffin of Genghis Khan seems to indicate that they are the orthodox and protectors of history, in order to deceive the people. However, the Ma bandits don't seem to have thought about it: Where are you going to escape with such a big coffin? I'm afraid that your "borrowing a corpse to resurrect the soul" will not succeed, but you will have to bury yourself along with the corpse!

### “借尸还魂”

　　“借尸还魂”
    江横
    刽子手们做事，总是绝世罕有，异乎常人；否则，岂不是对他们的祖宗希特勒“言之有愧”了吗？请看这样两则新闻吧：
    据报载：“青马匪帮于八月十三日自榆中败退逃窜时，将存放在该县城北兴龙山东山大佛殿的成吉思汗棂柩及遗像、梳装镜等物劫走。”今日本报发表的“胡马匪帮统治下的西北角”的通讯里又揭露了这样几段事实：马匪统治河西时，把酒泉抗拒缴官粮的农民领袖，用火枪打死三十多个人，火枪打了又以“尸身示众”；当年红军路过河西时，许多被马匪俘去的人，都被他用火活活地烧死在大坑里；陇上农民暴动时，被马匪开肠破肚处死的农民，也有好几千人。刑法也极尽残忍，除枪毙、活埋、火烧、砍头外，还有“活剥皮”、“点人油灯”等等花样。
    这个事实的对照可谓鲜明已极了！这个西北的“土皇帝”马步芳，虽在其败退逃窜时，还对已死了几百年的成吉思汗底棂柩，那样“孝敬”的劫走，而对养活他的千万农民们，却又是这样蛮横，活也嫌他们活得“不顺眼”，把他们活活地杀死；死也嫌他们死得“不痛快”，又加之以开肠破肚、剥皮等等严刑酷法。这自然不是偶然的，正是这些“土皇帝”从娘胎里带来的根性。
    但是，杀活人也好，劫死尸也好，都是为了保持他的“宝座”。
    谁都知道马匪步芳是靠打家劫舍起家，马匪鸿逵是靠他爸爸“保驾慈禧逃难”起家；后来又靠贼头子蒋介石发家，霸占西北一隅；如今蒋贼逃居台湾自顾不暇，且台湾距西北，山高路远，依靠无望，而西北人民早把他们恨之入骨；所以在人民解放军的矛头下，马匪帮自感“深池已干矣，坚石已碎矣！”只好捡起这个早已腐朽的成吉思汗的棂柩，作为“借尸还魂”的法宝。
    因为成吉思汗（元太祖）在西北民间是有影响的历史人物，马匪如此“保驾”成吉思汗的棂柩，好象表示他们才是历史的正统和历史的保护者，以此欺骗人民。但是，马匪似乎没有想一想：你抱着这么一个大棂柩逃到那里去呢？只怕你“借尸还魂”不成，反倒要赔尸殉葬了！
