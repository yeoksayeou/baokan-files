　　Large-Scale Irrigation Projects to be Constructed on the Yellow and Fen Rivers
　　North China Water Conservancy Inspection Team Returns to Beiping
　　[Report from this newspaper] The Yellow River and Fen River Water Conservancy Inspection Teams, composed of water conservancy experts from Tsinghua, Peking, and Peiyang Universities, invited by the Agricultural Department of the North China People's Government, have completed their inspections and returned to Beiping in late August. To understand the situation and exchange opinions, the department held a forum on August 31st at the Farmland Water Conservancy Office. First, Chen Shihua, Du Zhenfu, Chen Liangsheng, Li Wenda, and others from the Fen River Water Conservancy Inspection Team reported on the irrigation situation of the Fen River and the design of the permanent dam for the Shijin Canal irrigation channel. They also suggested regulating the Xiao River to stabilize the Fen River channel. Chen Mingshao, Li Piji, and Jie Zengyou from the Yellow River Water Conservancy Inspection Team reported on the topography, soil quality, and irrigation needs in the Dong'e area. They suggested that if a sluice gate could be built at Aishan to release water for irrigation, 400,000 mu of land on the north bank of the Yellow River would benefit. The total project cost would be no more than 10 million jin of millet, and the annual increase in production would be worth more than 20 million jin of millet, making it extremely economically valuable. Weishan, located 20 kilometers upstream of Aishan, has a similar topography to Aishan and can also have a sluice gate built to divert water to irrigate hundreds of thousands of mu of land. Currently, the Agricultural Department's water conservancy engineering team has begun surveying these two locations and will begin design work as soon as the survey is completed, striving to start construction. If there are no other problems, this project will become the first large-scale irrigation project in the lower reaches of the Yellow River.

　　黄河、汾河将修建大规模灌溉工程
  　华北水利考察团返平
    【本报讯】由华北人民政府农业部邀聘清华、北大、北洋三大学水利专家组成之黄河、汾河两水利考察团，已经考察完毕，于八月下旬先后回平。为了了解情况及交换意见，该部特于八月三十一日在农田水利处举行座谈会。首由汾河水利考察团陈士骅、杜镇福、陈梁生、李文达等分别报告汾河灌溉情况及石津运河灌溉渠永久坝的设计问题。并建议整理潇河以稳定汾河水道。黄河水利考察团陈明绍、李丕济、揭增佑报告了东阿一带地形、土质，及灌溉的需要后，建议如能在艾山设闸，放水灌溉，则黄河北岸四十万亩田地都将受益，全部工程费用，最多不过小米一千万斤，灌溉后，每年增产量约值小米二千万斤以上，极有经济价值。艾山上游二十公里处之位山，形势与艾山相似，亦可设闸引水灌溉数十万亩。现农业部水利工程队已开始在该两处进行测量，一俟测量完毕，即行设计，争取施工。该项工程如无其他问题，将成为黄河下游第一个大规模的灌溉工程。
