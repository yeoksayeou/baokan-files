　　Hungarian Trial Demonstrates People's Will
  　Socialist Camp Strong, Invincible
    Soviet, Hungarian, Polish, Czech, Austrian Newspapers Comment on Verdict in Hungarian Treason Case
    Pravda
    【Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 28th】Following the Hungarian People's Court's sentencing of Rajk and other traitors, newspapers in the Soviet Union, Hungary, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Austria have all published articles commenting on the matter. Pravda published an editorial entitled "Victory for the Camp of Peace, Democracy, and Socialism," stating: "The trial in Budapest has dealt a blow to the imperialist camp and convincingly demonstrated the victory of the democratic camp and the growth and consolidation of socialist forces in the people's democracies. The trial thoroughly proved that the imperialist conspirators were pursuing one goal: to overthrow the people's democratic system in Hungary and other people's democracies, restore the capitalist order in these countries, and turn these countries into imperialist colonies and bridgeheads for launching new wars. The imperialist conspirators chose the Tito group as their weapon to cunningly disguise their subversive activities. With the help of a gang of Tito spies who use 'socialist' deception, they hoped to inject the poison of espionage into the Communist and Workers' Parties and strike at the heart of the people's democratic system. The Budapest trial demonstrated the will of the people. The court pronounced its verdict on a gang of spies and assassins and nailed their imperialist masters to the pillory. This is a great victory for the Hungarian people, a great victory for the entire camp of peace, democracy, and socialism."
    Izvestia
    Izvestia published an editorial entitled "Verdict Against the Enemies of the Hungarian People, the Enemies of All Progressive Humanity," stating: "The trial has great international significance. The verdict of the People's Court in Budapest lets the imperialists know that the people of all countries are vigilant and that the forces of people's democracy are growing and strengthening. The socialist and democratic camp led by the Soviet Union is invincible."
    Hungarian Szabad Nép
    The Hungarian Workers' Party newspaper Szabad Nép published an article by Hungarian Workers' Party Politburo member Révai, stating: "The People's Court's verdict on the traitors has met the demands of millions of Hungarian working people. They have thoroughly considered the lessons learned from this verdict, aroused vigilance, and united the masses more closely around the Hungarian Workers' Party, strengthening their hatred for the provocateurs and the masters of the bandits—the imperialists and their Titoite agents, and awakening the most sublime socialist patriotic sentiments of millions of people. The Party's success and victory, the correct policy of its leading organs, its vitality and vigilance, have knocked the weapon aimed at the heart of our People's Republic out of the hands of the despicable conspirators. The Party's strength and unity are the guarantee and foundation for the growth of the people's power and people's welfare, and our country's peace and independence. In purging the Rajk gang, the Party has proven that the leadership of our country is entrusted to trustworthy hands, and that our people's state, labor, and peace are guarded by vigilant sentinels." The trade union Népszava said in an editorial: "The working people are raising their vigilance, understanding that this vigilance is an indispensable weapon in the struggle against the enemy. We are building socialism, understanding our strength, and convinced of the invincible power of the Soviet Union. We will sweep away those who attempt to hinder our construction of socialism, just as we swept away this gang of spies."
    Polish Trybuna Ludu
    The Polish Workers' Party newspaper Trybuna Ludu said: "The trial of the Hungarian People's Court has revealed all the details behind the conspiracy against Hungary and all the people's democracies. The threads of all conspiracies and evil plans lead to Belgrade, to the intelligence centers of the United States and Britain. The Polish working class and its party will increase their vigilance and enhance the combat capability of their ranks because of this trial. The verdict shows that no one can carry out their subversive activities against the people's democratic countries and go unpunished."
    Czech Rudé Právo
    The Czech Communist Party newspaper Rudé Právo said: "Marxism-Leninism teaches us that the Communist and Workers' Parties can only victoriously expose their enemies, no matter where the latter are hiding or what mask they are wearing, by systematically raising the ideological level of cadres, educating Party members in the spirit of intolerance towards the slightest deviation from the Marxist-Leninist line, strengthening organization, ruthlessly expelling hostile elements from the Party, waging a relentless struggle against all revisionist tendencies, and raising the class consciousness of the working class and all working people." The Czech Socialist Party newspaper Svobodné Slovo commented: "American imperialists are not only planning to overthrow the democratic system in Hungary, but also planning to overthrow the democratic system in other people's democracies, including Czechoslovakia. The Rajk trial must be a lesson for every Czechoslovakian, a lesson for every patriot. We must heighten our vigilance and safeguard the interests of the state and the people."
    Austrian Volksstimme
    The Austrian Communist Party newspaper Volksstimme said: "The world has learned what was previously only speculation. The Rajk gang's conspiracy is part of an international conspiracy by American imperialists against the people's democracies and against the Soviet Union, and also a conspiracy by war-mongers against the people of all nations. All the details of the conspiracy, from the planned assassination of Hungarian people's leaders to the establishment of a new Hungarian government composed of spies and foreign agents, have been brought to light. The vile creatures of Wall Street and the Tito group, composed of spies from the American intelligence agencies facing trial, have aroused the deep anger of working people around the world; but it is not enough to simply despise these demons, it is necessary to strengthen political awareness."

　　匈京审讯表现人民意志
  　社会主义阵营强固无敌
    苏匈波捷奥报纸评匈叛国案宣判
    真理报
    【新华社北京二十八日电】匈牙利人民法庭宣判拉伊克等叛国犯后，苏、匈、波、捷、奥地利等国报纸均著文评论。真理报以“和平、民主、社会主义阵营的胜利”为题发表社论说：布达佩斯的审讯打击了帝国主义阵营并且令人信服地表明了民主阵营的胜利和各人民民主国家中社会主义力量的增长与巩固。审讯详尽地证明了帝国主义阴谋者追求着一个目的，这就是要推翻匈牙利及其他人民民主国家中的人民民主制度，在这些国家恢复资本主义秩序，并把这些国家变成帝国主义的殖民地与进行新战争的桥头阵地。帝国主义阴谋者挑选出铁托集团作为他们的武器，以使他们的颠覆性活动得以狡猾地伪装起来。他们在那运用“社会主义”欺人之谈的一伙铁托间谍的帮助下，期望将间谍的毒素注入共产党与工人党，而打击人民民主制度的心脏。布达佩斯的审讯表现了人民的意志。法庭宣告对一伙间谍与刺客的判决，并且把他们的帝国主义主子钉上了枷。这是匈牙利人民的伟大胜利，整个和平、民主与社会主义阵营的伟大胜利。
    消息报
    消息报以“对匈牙利人民的敌人、全体进步人类的敌人的判决”为题发表社论说：审讯具有重大国际意义，布达佩斯人民法庭的判决使帝国主义者知道：各国人民是警惕着，人民民主的力量在增长壮大着。以苏联为首的社会主义与民主阵营是无敌的。
    匈牙利自由人民报
    匈工人党自由人民报刊登匈工人党政治局委员里瓦伊一文说：人民法庭对叛国犯的判决，满足了匈牙利千百万劳动人民的要求。他们彻底考虑了由这一判决所得的教训，唤起了警惕并把群众更紧密地团结在匈牙利工人党的周围，加强了他们对挑拨者和匪徒们的主子——帝国主义者及其铁托分子代理人的憎恨，唤醒了千百万人民最崇高的社会主义爱国主义的情绪。党的成功和胜利，它的领导机关的正确政策，它的活力和警觉，已打掉了卑鄙阴谋者手中指向我们人民共和国心脏的武器。党的实力和团结是人民政权和人民福利的增长、我国和平与独立的保证和基础。党在肃清了拉伊克一伙人的工作中已经证明了我国的领导权是付托在可信赖的手里，我们人民的国家、劳动与和平是为警觉的哨兵所警卫着。职工会涅普·斯查瓦报社论说：劳动人民正提高警觉，了解这种警觉是在对敌人进行斗争中不可缺少的武器。我们正在建设社会主义，明白我们的力量并确信苏联的无敌威力。我们将扫清企图阻碍我国建设社会主义的人，象我们扫除了这一伙间谍一样。
    波兰人民论坛报
    波兰工人党人民论坛报说：匈牙利人民法庭的审讯显露了反对匈牙利和一切人民民主国家的阴谋的幕后全部详情。一切阴谋和罪恶计划的线索都引向贝尔格莱德，引向美国和英国的谍报中心。波兰工人阶级及其政党将因这一审判而提高警觉和增大其队伍的战斗能力。判决显示：没有一个人能够进行其反人民民主国家的颠覆活动而逍遥法外。
    捷共红色权力报
    捷共红色权力报说：马列主义教导我们：共产党和工人党只有有系统地提高干部的思想水平，本着对马列主义路线丝毫的偏向都不宽容的精神教育党员，加强组织性，无情地把敌对分子驱逐出党，对一切修正主义倾向进行无情的斗争，并提高工人阶级和全体劳动人民的阶级觉悟，只有这样，才能胜利地暴露他们的敌人，不论后者隐藏于何处或带上什么假面具。捷社会党自由言论报评说：美国帝国主义者不仅计划着推翻匈牙利的民主制度，而且也计划着推翻其他人民民主国家的民主制度，包括捷克斯洛伐克在内。拉伊克的审判必须是每一个捷克斯洛伐克人的教训，每一个爱国者的教训。我们必须提高警觉，警卫国家和人民的利益。
    奥共人民舆论报
    奥地利共产党人民舆论报说：全世界已知道了在此刻以前仍属揣测的事情。拉伊克匪帮的阴谋是美帝国主义者反对人民民主国家，反对苏联的国际阴谋的一部分，同时也是战争贩子反对各民族人民的阴谋的一部分。一切阴谋的详情细节，从预谋暗杀匈牙利人民领袖到成立由间谍与外国代理人组成的新的匈牙利政府，均已水落石出。华尔街的卑鄙的动物和由面临法庭审讯的美国谍报机关之间谍所组成的铁托集团，已激起了全世界劳动人民深深的愤怒；但是单单蔑视这些魔王是不够的，必须加强政治觉悟性。
