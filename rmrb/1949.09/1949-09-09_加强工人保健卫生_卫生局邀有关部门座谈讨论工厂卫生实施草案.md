[Beijing News] In order to strengthen factory hygiene work, the Municipal People's Government Health Bureau recently investigated the sanitary conditions of twenty-three public factories in the city and drafted "Implementation Guidelines for Factory Hygiene in Beiping Municipality (Draft)". In order to widely solicit opinions from relevant departments and discuss specific implementation methods, the bureau held a symposium on factory hygiene issues on the 7th of this month. Thirteen representatives from the Labor Bureau, Industry and Commerce Bureau, Public Security Bureau, Enterprise Bureau, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the General Clothing Factory of the Military Supplies Department, the Enterprise Department of the North China People's Government, the Ministry of Communications and other units attended. At the meeting, Zhang Wenqi, Director of the Health Bureau, reported on the previous stage of factory investigation. He said: At present, the medical institutions and medical equipment of various factories are insufficient. Workers generally do not undergo physical examinations before entering the factory, and regular health check-ups are not held after entering the factory. Therefore, worker health care is an important part of today's factory hygiene work, and we cannot only focus on medical treatment and neglect worker health care. Representatives of various units expressed their opinions on how to establish factory hygiene organizations, how to carry out hygiene education and health care work, and discussed the draft implementation rules for factory hygiene. The draft will be submitted to the Municipal Government for approval before it can be promulgated and implemented.

  　卫生局邀有关部门座谈讨论工厂卫生实施草案
    【本市讯】本市人民政府卫生局为加强工厂卫生工作，已于日前调查了本市二十三个公营工厂的卫生情况，并草拟出“北平市工厂卫生实施须知草案”。为了广泛征求有关部门的意见以及商讨具体实施的办法，该局特于本月七日召开工厂卫生问题座谈会，到有劳动局、工商局、公安局、企业局及市总工会、军需部被服总厂、华北人民政府企业部、交通部等单位十三位代表。会上卫生局张文奇局长报告前一阶段调查工厂的情形，他说：目前各工厂的医疗机构与医疗设备都是不够的，工人进厂工作之前，一般都未经过身体检查，入厂后定期的健康检查也没有举行，因此工人的保健工作是今天工厂卫生工作重要的一项，不能只重医疗而忽略了工人保健。各单位代表在会上都对如何建立工厂卫生组织，如何进行卫生教育工作和保健工作等问题发表了意见，并讨论了工厂卫生实施草案，该项草案俟呈请市府核准后，即可公布施行。
