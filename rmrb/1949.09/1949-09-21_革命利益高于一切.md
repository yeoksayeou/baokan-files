　　Revolutionary Interests Above All Else
    Guo Yujian
    Comrade Bai Xiude is a deputy squad leader. A few days ago, his father came to see him from home specifically regarding his marriage, saying, "Your father-in-law has urged us several times, saying that the girl is getting older and should get married quickly. Can't you ask for leave to go back?" Comrade Bai Xiude explained to his father, "What's so important about this? The revolutionary situation is developing so fast, and the current tasks are so important. You go back and tell them not to bother with this!" Not long after his father returned, he received a letter from his father-in-law, urging him to return and get married quickly, otherwise, they would divorce his daughter from him. When the instructor read this passage, Bai Xiude took the letter and tore it up. He said, "Individual interests must be put aside, and revolutionary interests are above all else. No matter what they say, I won't go back, and it won't affect my work." He once said to the comrades in his squad: "This matter is for our district government to handle, so we don't need to worry. Husband and wife must be united politically. If she doesn't make progress, a divorce doesn't matter!"

　　革命利益高于一切
    郭玉健
    白秀德同志是副班长。为了他的婚事，他父亲前几天特地从家里来看他，说：“你岳父催了咱家好几次啦，说是姑娘大了，应该赶快结婚了，你不可以请假回去一趟吗？”白秀德同志向他父亲解释：“这事有啥要紧，革命形势发展这样快，现时任务这样重要，你回去告诉他们这事不用忙＠！”他父亲回去后不久，他接到了他岳父的一封信，让他赶快回去结婚，不然就和他离婚。指导员念到这一段时，白秀德便把信接过来撕了。他说：“个人利益必须放在一边，革命利益高于一切，任凭他们怎样说，反正我不回去，也影响不了我的工作。”他曾对班里同志说过：“这事有咱区政府呢，不用咱担心。夫妻要在政治上团结，她不进步，离婚也没关系！”
