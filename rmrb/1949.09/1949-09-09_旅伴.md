　　Fellow Travelers
    By Soviet writer Panova, translated by Su Ling, proofread by Cao Jinghua
    Part One: Night
    Chapter Three: Doctor Bilov
    So, Subao thought of going to see Doctor Bilov and telling him everything in detail. Subao knew that Krachov was not someone to be trifled with. Subao regarded the doctor as a talisman. He went to the doctor several times a day. The doctor looked at him with a humorous expression: Subao was always murmuring calculations, which he found quite amusing. Subao rolled his eyes, muttering:
    "One hundred and twenty times sixty-seven, equals eight thousand and forty centimeters, about eight kilograms and more."
    He wasn't very good at using the abacus, doing all the multiplication and division in his head.
    He didn't dare to resolutely go to the doctor. He didn't know what attitude the political commissar would take towards this kind of attack. The political commissar had cold eyes and a venomous little mouth. He wouldn't slap him, but who would want to ruin their relationship with such a person?
    "Conspirator," Subao thought of Danilov.
    He came up with a plan. Taking advantage of the mealtime on the commander's car, he took a can of minced meat from the storeroom, cut a slice of butter, and sprinkled a little white sugar. "What can I do?" he said softly. Counting the sugar cubes—there were forty-two. "Too much!" Subao thought, and put twelve of the largest ones back where they belonged. He hid these in his pocket and went to find Krachov. Krachov was asleep on the upper bunk of the commander's car, with a newspaper covering his face—only his small mustache was visible from under the newspaper... Sukhoedov was sleeping on the lower bunk. There was no one else nearby.
    Subao carefully pushed Krachov.
    "Comrade Krachov!" he said softly when the newspaper was moved away from Krachov's face and he looked at him with sleepy eyes. "You're angry for nothing, it's absolutely irrelevant."
    "What are you doing here?" Krachov sat up on the bunk, looking at the cigarette that Subao placed on his lap, and asked. "Oh, heavens: Am I a baby? Do I need to eat candy?"
    But Krachov, softened by Subao's docile attitude, forgave him.
    Subao felt relieved, and he was even happy that everyone saw him as an influential figure. He started joking with the women, something he hadn't done at first.
    "Hehe, look at that Pyna, really something!" he said when he met the head nurse in the corridor.
    Danilov heard and asked:
    "What does that mean?"
    "My involvement here is very little!" Subao said, raising both hands. "This is written by Pushkin."
    But the war continued, the enemy penetrated deep into the hinterland, enemy motorcycles sped along Russian roads, and enemy planes flew over Russian cities.
    "Did you see that?" Doctor Bilov asked Danilov. "Our people are laughing and having fun. As if nothing is happening."
    Danilov nodded:
    "What about it, that's good."
    He thought for a moment, and then repeated:
    "It's good to have fun. What's not good is imagining the scale of the disaster. Stalin also said that, but they still don't show it enough. We are here, on this train, in this isolated environment where we have not lost our civil rights."
    The doctor thought of Soni, thought of her tears. He became sad:
    "Do you think—will this disaster be so great?"
    Danilov smiled bitterly:
    "What's there to think? It's obvious." He bit his lip, speaking slowly, probably saying it with great pain. "It's far from over. We can't see the end. This is just the beginning..."
    "You know," the doctor said, "our people are prepared to make any sacrifice."

    第一部　夜
    第三章　比洛夫医生
    于是苏葆就想着去找比洛夫医生，把一切话都一五一十的告诉他。苏葆明白克拉错夫不是好开玩笑的那些人。苏葆把医生当护身符了。他每天要到医生那儿去好几趟。医生带着幽默的神情望着他：苏葆总是在喃喃的算着帐，这使他觉得怪好玩的。苏葆转动着眼睛，口里低声的算着：
    “一百二十乘六十七，得八千零四十公分，约八公斤多。”
    他算盘打得不高明，乘除全是心算的。
    他不敢决然去找医生的。他不知道政治委员对这种攻击抱什么态度。政治委员有一付冷酷的眼睛和一张刻毒的小嘴。耳光他是不会打他的，可是谁愿意同这样的人把关系弄坏呢？
    “阴谋家，”苏葆对达尼洛夫想道。
    他想出办法了。利用司令车上开饭的时间，他从储藏室里取了一罐肉末，切了一片黄油，撒了一点白糖。“我有什么办法呢？”他低声说着。数着糖块——竟有四十二块。“太多了！”苏葆想着，就把十二块最大的放回原地方。他把这些藏到兜里，就去找克拉错夫去了。克拉错夫在司令车上的上铺上睡着，用报纸盖着脸，——只有小胡须从报纸下边露出来……苏霍耶杜夫睡在下铺上。附近再没有别的人了。
    苏葆小心的把克拉错夫推了一下。
    “克同志！”当报纸从克拉错夫脸上挪开，用睡意朦胧的眼睛看着他的时候，他低声的说。“你白生气的，绝对不相干的。”
    “你在这儿干吗呢？”克拉错夫坐到铺上，望着苏葆往他膝上放的纸烟，问题。“呵，天呵：我是吃奶的孩子吗，我要吃糖吗？”
    可是见到苏葆这种温顺的态度而缓和起来的克拉错夫，就原谅了他。
    苏葆放心了，他甚至高兴着大家看他是有势力的人物了。他和女子们开起玩笑了，这种事在最初是没有的。
    “呵哈，瞧瞧吧，裴娜真那个呵！”他在走廊里遇到看护长的时候说。
    达尼洛夫听见就问道：
    “这是什么意思呢？”
    “这儿我的干系是很少呢！”苏葆说着，就把两手举起来。“这是普希金写的。”
    可是战争在继续着，敌人深入腹地了，敌人的摩托脚踏车，在俄罗斯的道路上急驶着，敌机在俄罗斯的城市上飞翔着。
    “你瞧见了吗？”比洛夫医生问着达尼洛夫说。“我们的人在笑着，在取乐呢。好象没有什么事似的。”
    达尼洛夫点了点头：
    “怎么呢，这是好的。”
    他想了一下，又重复道：
    “取乐才好呢。不好的是想象到灾害的规模。史大林也曾说过的，可是他们依然表现得不够。我们在这儿，在这列车上，处在这没有丧失公民权的与世隔绝的境地里呢。”
    医生想起了梭妮，想起了她的眼泪。他悲伤起来了：
    “你想——这灾害会这么大吗？”
    达尼洛夫苦笑了一声：
    “这有什么可想呢？那是显而易见的。”他咬着嘴唇，慢吞吞的说着，大概他说着很痛心的。“离结束还远着呢。还看不着边呢。这才开始……”
    “你知道，”医生说，“我们的人民是准备作任何牺牲呢。”
