　　Paying in Advance for Finished Products to Solve Funding Difficulties
    [Tianjin News] Recently, as the weather has turned cooler, egg factories in various parts of North China have successively started operations. In order to adapt to the season and promote the development of egg production, the state-owned North China Foreign Trade Company recently held discussions with egg factories in Tianjin, Baoding, Zhangjiakou, Datong, Fengzhen, and other places. It also placed orders with eight egg factories including Hebei, Lixing, Shengda, Yilong, Qingxing, Hengchang, Chengxing, and Yixingcheng, for a total of 84 tons in the first batch. The company's average purchase price was 2,800 yuan per pound, and it is estimated that each egg factory can obtain an actual profit of about 20 percent. Each order adopts a batch ticket method, and the delivery of goods on schedule is guaranteed by a shop guarantor. Therefore, the factories have uniformly responded favorably. As a result, Yixin in Tangshan and egg factories in various parts of Henan have also come to the company to negotiate sales. Because the Foreign Trade Company pays in advance after placing orders, it makes it convenient for each egg factory to have working capital for production. No problems occur in the process of purchasing raw materials and processing and manufacturing until sales, so each manufacturer can concentrate on developing production. At present, thanks to the results of the company's spring acquisition and assistance in starting production, the egg factories in this city have generally made profits, and are preparing to expand production scale and add egg factories. At the same time, because egg production exports in the spring were quite profitable, it has also stimulated the production enthusiasm of other private capitalists, who will set up factories in egg-producing areas in North China, such as Sangyuan, Dezhou, and other places. It is estimated that 30 egg factories may start production this autumn. Also, since the suspension of barter trade for egg exports on August 3, the foreign price has risen from 85 cents to 92 cents per pound. With the arrival of the seasonal export season, the prospect of egg exports this autumn will be even more favorable.

  　扶助各地蛋业发展
  　先期付款订购成品解决资金困难
    【天津讯】最近天气转凉，华北各地蛋厂均已相继开工。国营华北对外贸易公司为适应季节，推动蛋品生产之发展，日前曾与本市、保定、张家口、大同、丰镇等各地蛋厂分别洽谈，并向河北、利兴、盛大，义隆、庆兴、恒昌、诚兴、益兴诚等八家蛋厂订货，第一批共计订购八十四吨，公司每磅平均购价，为二千八百元，估计各蛋厂可获实际利润百分之二十左右。每次订货采用批票方式，并由铺保保证到期交货，故各厂一致反映良好，因之唐山怡新及河南各地蛋厂，也均纷纷到该公司接洽售货。因为对外贸易公司订货后即先期付款，使各蛋厂生产资金周转上获得便利，在采办原料及加工制造直到销售的过程中，都不致发生问题，故各厂家得以专一的发展生产。目前本市各家蛋厂因该公司春季收购扶助开工生产的结果，一般皆获得盈利，并将准备扩充生产规模及添设蛋厂。同时，由于春季蛋产出口获利颇多，也刺激了其他私人资本家的生产积极性，将分别在华北各产蛋地区，如桑园、德州等地设厂生产，据估计本年秋季将有三十家蛋厂可能开工生产。又，自八月三日蛋品出口停止易货后，国外价格已由每磅美金八毛五分，升至九毛二分，随出口季节性的来临，今秋蛋品出口前途益将有利。
