　　Bourgeois Cosmopolitanism and Its Reactionary Role
　　By Chernov, Translated by Zhou Nanjie, Revised by Cao Ting

　　The ideology of cosmopolitanism is produced by the bourgeois society's mode of production itself.

　　Cosmopolitanism is the negation of patriotism, the opposite of patriotism. It adopts a completely indifferent attitude towards the fate of the motherland. Cosmopolitanism denies that people should have any civic and moral responsibility towards their own country and people.

　　The bourgeoisie advocates the principle that money has no motherland; wherever one can "make money" and "do good business," that is one's motherland. Bourgeois cosmopolitanism is thus used to cover up, disguise, and "sanctify" the despicable, anti-patriotic ideas of the lonely and unattached bourgeois industrialists, businessmen, and compradores.

　　The poisonous ideas of cosmopolitanism are a most convenient ideological tool for the bourgeoisie and its lackeys to defend and conceal all kinds of anti-patriotic activities, treasonous acts, and political double-dealing. Marx once pointed out, "Bourgeois patriotism... has degenerated into pure hypocrisy since the bourgeoisie's financial, trade, and industrial operations have acquired a world character." (Complete Works of Marx and Engels, Vol. 3, p. 355)

　　In the era of imperialism, the idea of cosmopolitanism became a weapon for imperialist bandits to seize world hegemony.

　　During the First World War, Lenin, adhering to the Bolshevik program on the national question and fighting for the realization of national self-determination, wrote:

　　"Imperialism means that the growth of capital has transcended the boundaries of the state, it means the extension and intensification of national oppression on a new historical basis. Therefore, contrary to Parabelum's opinion, we should link the revolutionary struggle for socialism with the revolutionary program on the national question."

　　Lenin's assertion pointed out the close connection between the revolutionary struggle for socialism and the defense of the people's national sovereignty.

　　Imperialism is inseparable from the persecution of national sovereignty and the intensification of national oppression. In the policy of ruthlessly exploiting oppressed nations and in the expansionist aggression of the imperialist bourgeoisie, lies the source of bourgeois cosmopolitanism, which promotes national nihilism.

　　National sovereignty, the liberation struggle of oppressed nations, the patriotic sentiments of freedom-loving nations, especially the strong patriotic spirit of the Soviet people—all of these are huge obstacles to the aggression of imperialist bandits, hindering the imperialists' plans to establish world hegemony. In order to destroy the will of resistance of all nations, the imperialists and their lackeys among the right-wing social democrats vigorously propagate that national sovereignty is now outdated and fabricate their own set of notions of national and state autonomy.

　　The ruling groups of various countries that are the objects of American imperialist expansion spare no effort to revile and denounce the masses' desire to safeguard their national independence, calling on them to abandon national sovereignty, thereby aiding and abetting American imperialism.

　　The spokesmen of imperialism frantically attack the desire of all nations to defend their national sovereignty and national independence. They shamelessly declare that the desire of all nations to defend or strive for national independence—that is, their unwillingness to automatically surrender to imperialist aggressors—is "outdated."

　　Promoting national nihilism means consciously and deliberately opposing socialist countries and people's democratic countries with the ideology of Anglo-American imperialism. The people of people's democratic countries, under the leadership of the Communist Party and with the support of the Soviet Union, are heroically and resolutely fighting for their national independence. At present, the Communist Parties in various countries are the inheritors and most resolute defenders of the excellent national traditions of their respective countries, the vanguard fighters for the freedom and independence of all nations, and are leading the masses of the people to resist the plunder, expansion, and aggression of American imperialism.

　　Today, bourgeois cosmopolitanism is a manifestation of the aggressive, imperialist policy of the reactionary bourgeoisie in capitalist countries that are single-mindedly seeking to dominate the world. The uneven economic and political development of capitalism in the age of imperialism naturally and inevitably produced a struggle for world hegemony, with a few monopoly capitalists intending to exploit the entire world.

　　"To rule the world"—Lenin pointed out—"is, in brief, the content of imperialist policy, and it leads to imperialist war."

　　In the current situation, American imperialism puts forward the demand to rule the world. This is because American imperialists today appear as the most fanatical promoters of cosmopolitanism. Modern bourgeois cosmopolitanism—this is a carefully selected weapon in the ideological warfare of American imperialism to seize world hegemony. Through the propaganda of cosmopolitanism, American imperialism is carrying out ideological preparations to realize its expansionist and predatory schemes. The idea of bourgeois cosmopolitanism is a convenient cover for spies engaged in sabotage activities under the command of foreign agents. Beneath the mask of cosmopolitanism, under the slogan of fighting against the absurd "narrow national egoism," hides the beastly face of the new war provocateurs who are trying to realize the American dream of world domination. The American imperialist groups are now promoting the ideas of "world citizens," "world government," and so on.

　　Comrade Zhdanov, in his report at the meeting of representatives of several Communist Parties, exposed the essence of this propaganda:

　　"One of the directions of the ideological 'offensive' that accompanies the plan to enslave Europe,"—Comrade Zhdanov said—"is to attack the principle of national sovereignty and independence, calling on all nations to abandon their autonomous rights, and using the so-called concept of 'world government' to oppose it. The intention of this 'offensive' is to whitewash the endless territorial expansion of American imperialism and the arbitrary destruction of the autonomous rights of all nations, to portray the United States as the defender of the laws of all mankind, and to accuse anyone who resists American aggression as a supporter of outdated 'selfish' nationalism." (Liberation Press Edition: "On the Post-War International Situation," p. 61)

　　The patriotism of the masses is a powerful spiritual weapon for the laborers in their struggle for freedom and national independence. Bourgeois cosmopolitanism, which opposes patriotism, intends to disarm the masses of the people ideologically in their resistance to American imperialist expansion. With the help of cosmopolitan propaganda, the bourgeoisie of Western European countries and its lackeys, such as Blum, Bevin, and Schumacher, try to justify their treacherous acts and try to complete the ideological preparation for surrendering these countries to American imperialism.

　　Comrade Zhdanov pointed out that bourgeois cosmopolitanism, especially the idea of "world government" in it, has a clear anti-Soviet tendency. He said:

　　"The idea of 'world government,' picked up by the bourgeois intellectuals from the ranks of dreamers and pacifists, is not only used as a means of oppression to ideologically disintegrate those nations that defend their independence from American imperialist encroachment, but also as a slogan specifically directed against the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries, because they are unyieldingly and thoroughly adhering to the principles of true equality among all nations, large and small, and their principles of defending autonomous rights." (Ibid.)

　　Modern cosmopolitanism, which is a disguise for the Anglo-American plan to dominate the world, is merely the opposite of the foolish, bourgeois Anglo-American nationalism and racism.

　　Cosmopolitanism and nationalism—the two are not opposites, but merely variants of the same thing, two aspects of the ideology of bourgeois imperialism. Cosmopolitanism has always been, and is now, merely disguised, made-up nationalism. Marx and Engels, when exposing the "true socialists" of the German bourgeoisie at the time, wrote indignantly: "...How narrow and national is the world view at the core of the Germans' fanciful cosmopolitanism and universalism."

　　At the core of modern bourgeois cosmopolitanism lies the selfish, imperialist interests of Anglo-American monopoly capitalists, and the militant nationalism of the Anglo-American bourgeoisie.

　　The whole set of cosmopolitan propaganda of the concepts of "world citizen," "world government," "world power," "supranational," and so on exported by the United States is destined to become the ideological disguise of Anglo-American nationalism.

　　Leninism revealed the roots of bourgeois cosmopolitanism. Lenin wrote: "...The alliance of the imperialists of all countries, which naturally and inevitably is for the protection of capitalists who know no fatherland, is proved by many of the most striking, the greatest episodes in world history: capitalists place the cause of the alliance of capitalists within all countries against the workers above the fatherland, the people, and any other interests." (Complete Works of Lenin, Vol. 23, p. 4)

　　Here, Lenin pointed out: The bourgeoisie puts the selfish interests of its own class "above the fatherland, the people, and any other interests," and they organized an "alliance of the imperialists of all countries" in the name of defending the interests of their own class to oppose the laborers.

　　The new international situation after the end of World War II—the growth of the power and international prestige of the Soviet Union, the departure of the people's democratic countries from the imperialist system, the leftward shift of the masses in capitalist countries, the tremendous growth of socialist and democratic forces throughout the world, and the growth of the national liberation movement of the people in colonial and semi-colonial countries—all of this aroused intense hatred for the imperialist, anti-democratic camp, which is headed by the United States and whose main purpose is to fight against socialism and democracy.

　　For bourgeois cosmopolitanism, its call to abandon national sovereignty and its ideas of "world government" and organizing a "European Federation" are all attempts to ideologically "lay the foundation" and "sanctify" this "imperialist alliance" hidden behind the shield of American imperialism, in order to oppose the working masses, oppose the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, and oppose the unstoppable growing forces of socialism and democracy throughout the world.

　　Bourgeois cosmopolitanism, from beginning to end, is the extremely reactionary ideology of the imperialist bourgeoisie, the ideological banner of the imperialist anti-democratic camp. Therefore, the struggle against bourgeois cosmopolitanism constitutes an indispensable and extremely important part of the struggle against imperialism and against decadent bourgeois ideology.

　　　　　　×　　　　　　　　×　　　　　　　　×

　　Bourgeois cosmopolitanism is first and foremost opposed to patriotism. Therefore, the task of further educating, developing, and cultivating Soviet patriotism requires resolutely fighting against cosmopolitanism, and completely defeating this shameful remnant of bourgeois ideology that prostrates itself before Western capitalism.

　　The Soviet patriotism, which is opposed by the lonely and unattached cosmopolitans with their rebellious acts, is a powerful weapon of our Party and the Soviet people, and an inexhaustible source of creativity for the Soviet people.

　　Comrade Stalin, in revealing the indestructible spiritual strength of the Soviet people and their laboring and fighting heroism, which were clearly manifested during the years of the Great Patriotic War, said:

　　"The source of the labor achievements of the Soviet people in the rear and the immortal fighting achievements of our soldiers in the front is ardent and abundant Soviet patriotism."

　　In this extremely profound statement, Comrade Stalin explained the great, truly immeasurable significance that ardent and vigorous Soviet patriotism has in our social life and in the life and actions of the entire Soviet people.

　　Soviet patriotism, which has been widely developed in our country due to the victory of socialism and which is used by the Party of Lenin-Stalin to educate the Soviet people, has become a powerful driving force for the development of Soviet society.

　　Soviet patriotism is generated by the Soviet people's loyalty to their socialist motherland, and it is the solid foundation of the Soviet multi-ethnic state, which unites all the nationalities of our country into a fraternal family.

　　Soviet patriotism is a powerful ideological motivator for the people of our country, promoting selfless labor and heroic deeds for the socialist motherland and for the victory of communism. The noble feelings of Soviet national self-esteem and the recognition that Soviet society and socialist culture are infinitely superior to bourgeois society and its culture are brilliant manifestations of Soviet patriotism.

　　Soviet patriotism and the Soviet sense of national self-esteem are a reliable ideological barrier, shattering all attempts by international reactionary forces to make the Soviet people flatter the capitalist West.

　　Soviet patriotism, as the people's infinite loyalty to their socialist motherland, to the Soviet social and state system, is a phenomenon of essential novelty. Soviet patriotism is the priceless fruit of the fundamental change that has taken place in people's consciousness as a result of the victory of the great October Socialist Revolution in our country. Soviet patriotism, in terms of its influence on people's minds and spirits, is unprecedented.

　　"It must be admitted," Comrade Molotov said, "that the most important achievement of our revolution is the new spiritual face of the people as Soviet patriots and their ideological growth."

　　In the course of the Bolshevik Party's and the Soviet people's heroic struggle to defend the socialist motherland and build socialism, Soviet patriotism was generated, consolidated, and triumphed.

　　Throughout the entire history of the Soviet state, the Bolshevik Party has consistently educated the working masses of our country in the spirit of Soviet patriotism.

　　Long before the eve of the Great October Socialist Revolution, Comrade Stalin, in exposing the "theory" advocated by the Mensheviks-Trotskyites that Russia should completely rely on the capitalist West, said:

　　"It is not impossible for Russia to become a country that opens up the path to socialism... We must abandon the outdated notion that only Europe can show us the way." (Complete Works of Stalin, Vol. 3, pp. 186-187)

　　These truly patriotic prophecies of Comrade Stalin gave the Bolshevik Party and the ranks of workers a firm belief in their own strength and in the possibility of socialist development within our country.

　　In 1917, "the Russian people completed a huge leap—from Tsarist rule to the Soviets." (Complete Works of Lenin, Vol. 12, p. 185) The overthrow of the rule of the exploiting classes and the establishment of Soviet power meant that the working masses of our country, thanks to the heroic struggle of the Bolshevik Party, finally discovered their socialist motherland. "From September 7 (October 25 according to the Russian calendar) onwards," Lenin said, "we have openly declared that because we have this one motherland, we will defend it..." (Ibid., p. 400) In arguing for the patriotic concept of defending the socialist motherland, Lenin pointed out that under the conditions of the dictatorship of the proletariat, this concept acquired a new, socialist content, because, in defending the motherland, "we are defending socialism, defending the socialist motherland." (Ibid., p. 382).

　　The Party of Lenin-Stalin led the relentless struggle against all enemies of the socialist motherland. The Bolsheviks gave a firm rebuff to the so-called "Left Communists" who participated in the counter-revolutionary conspiracy of the Trotsky-Bukharin group. This group of enemies of the Party and the people attempted to place the socialist motherland, which the working masses had just won, under the plunder of foreign armed interventionists, and they concealed it with flowery words such as "revolutionary war" and "international" interests. They declared: "For the sake of the interests of the international revolution, we believe that even the loss of Soviet power is timely."

　　Lenin called this ugly provocative traitorous speech of the Bukharin gang "fantastic nonsense." Lenin indignantly exposed such acts of betrayal and treachery. While clearing away the anti-Soviet anti-patriotic delirium of the "Left Communists," Lenin tore off their mask of internationalism and pointed out: Under the conditions of the victory of the proletariat in one country, true internationalism is to fully defend the socialist motherland. "Precisely in order to 'strengthen ties' with international socialism," Lenin wrote, "it is necessary to defend the socialist motherland." (Complete Works of Lenin, Vol. 12, p. 510)

　　One of the Trotsky-Bukharin gang's favorite tactics for carrying out sabotage activities was the endless slander of the Soviet people and their socialist achievements, and the frantic promotion of submission to the capitalist West. In their anti-patriotic frenzy, the Trotsky-Bukharin followers indulged in insulting the Russian people, calling them "the nation of Oblomov." They declared that Leninism—the highest achievement of Russian and world culture, the glory and pride of the Soviet people—was a doctrine with national limitations. Prostrating themselves at the feet of the capitalist West, these people attempted to extinguish the Soviet people's confidence in the victory of socialism, and they declared: It is impossible for the Soviet people to overcome the country's technical and economic backwardness with their own strength, and "backward" Russia cannot catch up with "advanced" Europe.

　　Comrade Stalin, in exposing the enemies of the people, the Trotsky-Bukharin gang, said: They are "a bunch of spies, assassins, enemies, prostrating themselves at the feet of foreigners, filled with the subservient feeling of slaves towards every foreign servant, and ready to work as spies for them—a group of people who do not know that the Soviet citizens, who have recently been liberated from the shackles of capitalists, are higher than any foreign senior servant who is burdened with the enslavement of capitalism…." ("Problems of Leninism," p. 590)

　　In the struggle against all enemies of the socialist motherland—the Trotskyites, the Bukharinites, and the bourgeois nationalists—Lenin and Stalin pointed out that there is no and cannot be any contradiction and divergence between the proletariat, which defends the socialist motherland, in their loyal service to the socialist motherland and their internationalist tasks.

　　Soviet patriotism is inseparable from proletarian internationalism and is organically linked to the latter. It is organically linked to the national traditions of all the nations that are of vital interest to all the laborers in the Soviet Union. Soviet patriotism, with its own socialist essence, rejects any kind of preaching of national and racial particularities, and any nationalism and racial prejudices are alien to it. Soviet patriotism is a complete antithesis of bourgeois pseudo-patriotism, which is permeated from beginning to end with the spirit of nationalism and chauvinism, and it is alien to the masses of the people.

　　As Lenin pointed out, "Internationalism is not anti-national." (Complete Works of Lenin, 4th Edition, Vol. 21, p. 245) Lenin's instruction has principled significance because it shows that proletarian internationalism and bourgeois cosmopolitanism, which is the ideological banner of the current reactionary forces, have nothing in common.

　　"If internationalism is based on respect for other nations, then we cannot be internationalists if we do not respect or love our own people." (Zhdanov)

　　Bourgeois cosmopolitanism, with its preaching of indifference to the fate and interests of its own country and people, and its mockery and contempt for the true patriotism of all nations, can only educate a group of merchants despised by the motherland.

　　The Bolshevik Party, throughout the entire history of socialist construction in the Soviet Union, has led and is leading the most resolute and principled struggle against all anti-patriotic phenomena and against all enemies of the Soviet people and Soviet culture.

　　The struggle against the enemies of Leninism has always been a profound patriotic struggle for the development of our country along the socialist path, for the freedom and independence of our country, and for the victory of socialism. In such a struggle, the Party has cultivated the Soviet people's infinite confidence in their own creativity, developed and nurtured their Soviet patriotic feelings, their own national self-esteem, and their own recognition of being superior to the people of the bourgeois world.

　　The Party exposed the essence of the anti-patriotic, bourgeois cosmopolitanism of flattering the capitalist West, and pointed out that this slavishness to foreigners will inevitably lead to national betrayal, leading to the betrayal of the interests of the Soviet people and the socialist motherland. The exposure of the anti-patriotic group of lonely and unattached cosmopolitans and the struggle against bourgeois cosmopolitanism fully demonstrate how concerned the Bolshevik Party is with educating the working masses of our country in the spirit of vigorous Soviet patriotism.

　　The decisions and instructions of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) on ideological issues dealt a devastating blow to the manifestations of bourgeois ideology, and mobilized the Party and all workers on the ideological front to conduct a tireless struggle against bourgeois influence, and to fight for the strengthening of the Bolshevik spirit and the militant Soviet patriotic spirit. The purpose of these resolutions and instructions of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) is to "strengthen the Party spirit in Soviet science, literature, and art, and to elevate all departments of our socialist culture—printing, propaganda, science, literature, and art—to a new and higher level" (Malenkov).

　　资产阶级的世界主义及其反动作用
    切尔诺夫著  周南节译  曹汀校
    世界主义的思想是由资产阶级社会的生产方式本身所产生的。
    世界主义是爱国主义的否定，是爱国主义的对立物。它对祖国的命运采取全然漠不关心的态度。世界主义否定人们对其自己的祖国及人民应负有任何公民及道义的责任。
    资产阶级主张这样的原则——金钱无祖国，哪里能够“赚钱”，哪里能够“做好买卖”，哪里就是祖国。资产阶级世界主义就是这样来掩护、伪装及“圣化”孤寡无亲的资产阶级实业家，生意人及买办们的卑鄙的、反爱国主义的思想。
    有毒素的世界主义思想是资产阶级及其走狗们的一种最便利的思想工具，用以辩护并掩盖各式各样的反爱国主义活动，卖国行为及政治上的两面派手腕。马克思曾经指明，“资产阶级的爱国主义……自从资产阶级的金融、贸易及工业的经营具有了世界的性质以后，就蜕化成为纯然的虚伪了。”（马恩全集，第三卷，三五五页）
    在帝国主义时代，世界主义的思想变成了帝国主义匪徒们夺取世界霸权的武器。
    在第一次世界大战期间，列宁坚持着对民族问题的布尔塞维克纲领，为实现民族的自决权而斗争，他写道：
    “帝国主义意味着资本的生长已经超出了国家的范围，它意味着在新的历史基础上民族压迫的推广和加剧。因此，与巴拉别鲁姆的意见相反，我们就应该把争取社会主义的革命斗争与对民族问题的革命纲领连结在一起”。
    列宁的这一论断指明了争取社会主义的革命斗争与卫护人民的国家主权二者间紧密的连系。
    帝国主义与迫害各民族的国家主权及剧烈的民族压迫是不可分的。在对被压迫民族进行最残酷剥削的政策中，在帝国主义资产阶级的扩张主义的侵略当中，隐藏着宣扬民族虚无主义的资产阶级世界主义的泉源。
    国家主权，被压迫民族的解放斗争，爱好自由的民族的爱国主义感情，尤其是苏维埃人民的强烈爱国精神——所有这一切都是帝国主义强盗进行侵略的巨大障碍，妨碍着帝国主义者树立世界霸权的计划。为了想要击毁各民族的反抗意志，帝国主义者及其右派社会党人中的走狗们就大肆宣传，说什么国家主权现在已是过时之物，并虚构了自己的一套民族与国家自主的观念。
    作为美帝扩张对象的各国统治集团都不遗余力地唾骂、非难群众维护自己国家独立的愿望，号召他们放弃国家主权，而以此为美帝国主义帮凶。
    帝国主义的代言人们疯狂的攻击各民族防卫自己的国家主权与国家独立的愿望，他们厚颜无耻地宣称各民族防卫或争取国家独立的愿望——即是他们的不甘愿自动地向帝国主义侵略者屈服——是“过时之物”。
    宣扬民族虚无主义即是自觉地，故意地以英美帝国主义的思想反对社会主义国家，反对人民民主主义国家。人民民主主义国家的人民，在共产党的领导和苏联的支持下正在英勇地、坚决地为自己的国家独立而斗争。目前在世界各国内的共产党正是各国的优秀民族传统的继承人和最坚决的保卫者，是各民族的自由与独立的先锋战士，领导着人民大众反抗美帝国主义的掠夺及扩张侵略。
    今日资产阶级的世界主义是一心一意想统治全世界的大资本主义国家中反动的资产阶级的侵略的、帝国主义政策的表现。帝国主义时代资本主义在经济方面和政治方面的不平衡发展自然地、不可避免地产生了争取世界霸权，少数独占资本家意图剥削全世界的斗争。
    “统治全世界”——列宁指出——“简括地说，即是帝国主义政策的内容，它将引向帝国主义的战争。”
    在目前形势下美帝国主义提出统治世界的要求。这是因为美帝国主义者在今天表现为世界主义的最狂热的宣传者。现代的资产阶级世界主义——这是美帝攫取世界霸权的思想战中的精选武器。借着世界主义的宣传，美帝国主义正进行着实现其扩张及掠夺阴谋的思想上的准备。资产阶级世界主义的思想是在外国密探指挥下从事破坏活动的间谍分子的便利遮盖。在世界主义的词藻的面具下，在荒诞的与“狭隘的民族自私主义”作战的口号下，隐藏力图实现美国统治世界梦想的新战争挑拨者的兽脸。美国的帝国主义者集团现在就又在宣传什么“世界公民”、“世界政府”等观念。
    日丹诺夫同志在数国共产党代表会议上的报告中，揭穿了这一宣传的实质：
    “伴随着奴役欧洲计划而来的思想‘攻势’方向之一，”——日丹诺夫同志说——“就是向着国家主权独立的原则进攻，号召各民族放弃其自主权利，而以所谓‘世界政府’的观念来对抗。这一‘攻势’的意图，在于粉饰美帝国主义的无止境的领土扩张和对于各民族的自主权利的任意破坏，而把美国装扮成全人类法律的维护者，而谁若抗拒美国的侵犯，就把谁指责为陈腐的‘自私的’民族主义的拥护者”。（解放社版：“论战后国际形势”六一页）
    人民大众的爱国主义是劳动者为自由及国家独立斗争的强有力的精神武器。反对爱国主义的资产阶级世界主义意图解除反抗美帝扩张的人民大众的思想武装。借助于世界主义的宣传，西欧国家的资产阶级及其走狗们如勃鲁姆、贝文、舒马赫之流，力图为他们的叛国行为做辩护，力图完成使这些国家投降于美帝国主义的思想准备。
    日丹诺夫同志指出，资产阶级的世界主义，特别是其中“世界政府”的观念，有着明显的反苏的倾向。他说：
    “资产阶级知识分子从幻想者与和平主义者群中所拾来的‘世界政府’的观念不仅被作为一种压迫手段以便思想上瓦解那些保卫自己独立使之不受美帝国主义侵害的民族，而且被作为一种口号，专门对付苏联和新民主主义各国，因为它们正在不屈不挠地、彻底地坚持各大小民族真正平等原则和他们保卫自主权利的原则。”（同上）
    做为英美统治世界的掠夺计划的伪装的现代世界主义，只不过是愚蠢的、资产阶级的英美民族主义与种族主义的反面而已。
    世界主义与民族主义——二者并非对立，只不过是一物的变种，资产阶级帝国主义的思想的两方面。世界主义一直就是，现在也只是掩盖着的，化了妆的民族主义。马克思和恩格斯在当时揭发德国资产阶级的“真正社会主义者”时，曾经愤慨地写道：“……德国人的幻想的宇宙主义和世界主义骨子里是多么狭隘的、民族的世界观。”
    现代资产阶级的世界主义骨子里存在着英美独占资本家的自私自利的、帝国主义的利益，存在着英美资产阶级好战的民族主义。
    由美国输出的“世界公民”、“世界政府”、“世界权力”、“超国家”等等观念的全套世界主义宣教，注定要成为英美民族主义的思想伪装。
    列宁主义揭示了资产阶级世界主义的根源。列宁写道：“……各国帝国主义者的同盟，这同盟自然而不可避免地是为了保护不知有祖国的资本家，为在世界历史上的许多最惊人、最伟大的插话证明：资本家把维护一切国家内的资本家反对劳动者的同盟的事看得高于祖国、人民和任何其他的利益。”（列宁全集第二十三卷四页）
    这里，列宁指出：资产阶级把自私自利的本阶级的利益放在“祖国、人民和任何其他的利益之上”，他们以保卫本阶级的利益为名组织了“各国帝国主义者同盟”来反对劳动者。
    第二次大战结束后的新的国际形势——苏联威力及其国际威望的增长，人民民主国家之由帝国主义体系中脱出，资本主义国家中群众的左倾，全世界社会主义及民主力量的巨大增长，殖民地及半殖民地人民民族解放运动的成长——这一切都唤起了对帝国主义、反民主阵营的强烈憎恨，这一阵营是以美国为首的，其主要目的是与社会主义及民主作战。
    对于资产阶级的世界主义，它的放弃国家主权的号召及其“世界政府”和组织“欧洲联邦”等观念，都是企图在思想上“奠定”和“圣化”这个藏在美帝国主义的盾牌后面的“帝国主义者同盟”，以反对劳动群众，反对苏联及人民民主国家，反对全世界不可遏止地增长着的社会主义及民主的力量。
    资产阶级的世界主义自始至终即是帝国主义资产阶级的极端反动的思想、帝国主义反民主阵营的思想旗帜。因此，与资产阶级的世界主义所进行的斗争，就构成了反对帝国主义，反对腐朽的资产阶级思想的斗争的一个必不可少并且是极其重要的部分。
    　　　　　　×　　　　　　　　×　　　　　　　　×
    资产阶级的世界主义首先是反对爱国主义的。因此，进一步教育、发展和培养苏维埃爱国主义的任务，就需要坚决地与世界主义作战，就需要完全战胜这种对西方资本主义卑躬屈膝的、可耻的、资产阶级思想的残余。
    为孤寡无亲的世界主义者以其叛逆行为所反对的苏维埃爱国主义，是我们党与苏联人民的强大武器，是苏维埃人创造力的不竭源泉。
    斯大林同志在揭示出在伟大的卫国战争的年代里显明地表现出来的苏维埃人们的不可摧毁的精神力量及其劳动的与战斗的英雄主义时，他说：
    “苏维埃人民在后方的劳动功绩，和我们的战士们在前方的不朽的战斗功绩，其源泉即是热烈而充沛的苏维埃爱国主义。”
    斯大林同志在这一极其深邃的论断中，说明了热烈而蓬勃的苏维埃爱国主义在我们的社会生活中、在全苏维埃人民的生活和行动中所具有的那种伟大的真正无可估量的意义。
    由于社会主义的胜利而在我国广泛发展的、被列宁——斯大林的党用来教育苏联人民的苏维埃爱国主义，已成为苏维埃社会发展的强大的动力。
    苏维埃爱国主义是由苏维埃人民对自己的社会主义祖国的忠诚所产生，它是将我国一切民族团结在一个兄弟般的家庭里的苏维埃多数民族国家的巩固基础。
    苏维埃爱国主义是我国人民的强有力的思想上的鼓舞者，宣扬着为社会主义的祖国，为共产主义的胜利而进行奋不顾身的劳动和英雄的事业。苏维埃民族自尊的高尚感情，及苏维埃社会与社会主义文化比资产阶级社会及其文化无限优越的认识，乃是苏维埃爱国主义辉煌的表现。
    苏维埃爱国主义及苏维埃的民族自尊感是一道可靠的思想藩篱，粉碎了想使苏维埃人民对资本主义的西方阿谀奉承的国际反动势力的种种企图。
    苏维埃爱国主义，作为人民大众对自己社会主义祖国、对苏维埃社会与国家制度的无限忠诚的感情，是一种本质新颖的现象。苏维埃爱国主义是由于伟大的十月社会主义革命在我国获得胜利，因而在人们的意识中产生了根本的改变的无价果实。苏维埃爱国主义，就它对人们的头脑与精神的影响力来讲，是史无前例的。
    由于我国的劳动大众掌握了自己的社会主义祖国，因而产生的新的社会关系，也使人民大众对于祖国及国家具有了新的关系。这种新的关系就表现为苏维埃人的新的精神面貌的最深刻最显明的特征所构成的苏维埃社会主义爱国主义。
    “必须承认，——莫洛托夫同志说——我们革命的最重要的成果是作为苏维埃爱国主义者的人民的新的精神面貌及其思想上的成长。”
    在布尔塞维克党及苏联人民保卫社会主义祖国及建设社会主义的英勇斗争过程中，苏维埃爱国主义产生了，巩固了，战胜了。
    在苏维埃国家全部历史过程中，布尔塞维克党始终是以苏维埃的爱国主义精神教育我国的劳动大众。
    远在伟大的十月社会主义革命的前夜，斯大林同志在揭破孟塞维克——托洛茨基派所主张的俄国要完全依靠资本主义的西方的“理论”时就说过：
    “俄国并不是没有可能成为开拓走向社会主义的道路的国家……必须抛弃只有欧洲才能指示给我们道路的那种陈腐的观念。”（斯大林全集，第三卷，一八六——一八七页）
    斯大林同志的这些充满了真正爱国主义的预言，使布尔塞维克党和工人的队伍对于自己的力量，对于在我们国家内社会主义发展的可能性，获得了坚固的信念。
    一九一七年“俄国人民完成了巨大的飞跃—由沙皇统治一跃而至苏维埃”。（列宁全集，第十二卷，一八五页）推翻剥削阶级的统治而建立苏维埃政权意味着我国的劳动大众，由于布尔塞维克党的英勇斗争，最后终于发现了自己的社会主义祖国。“从九月七日（俄历十月二十五日）起—一列宁说——我们就公开地宣称，因为我们有了这一个祖国，我们就要保卫它……。”（同书，四○○页）在论证保卫社会主义的祖国的爱国主义观念时，列宁指出，在无产阶级专政的条件下，这一观念就获得了新的、社会主义的内容，因为，保卫祖国，“我们就是保卫社会主义，保卫社会主义的祖国”。（同书，三八二页）。
    列宁——斯大林的党领导了反对一切社会主义祖国的敌人的无情斗争。布尔塞维克曾给与参加托洛茨基——布哈林集团反革命阴谋的所谓“左派共产党人”以坚决的回击。这批党与人民的仇敌企图将工农大众刚刚争取到的社会主义祖国置于外国武装干涉者的掠夺之下，并以什么“革命的战争”和“国际的”利益等花言巧语掩饰，他们宣称：“为了国际革命的利益，我们认为那怕是丧失苏维埃政权，也是合乎时宜的。”
    列宁称布哈林匪帮的这种丑恶挑拨性的叛徒言论为“奇谈怪论”。列宁愤慨地揭破了这类叛变和出卖的行动。列宁一方面扫清了“左派共产主义者”反苏反爱国主义的谵语，一方面撕开了他们的国际主义的假面具，并指明：在无产阶级在一国胜利的条件下，真正的国际主义就是全力地保卫社会主义的祖国。“正为了要与国际社会主义‘加强联系’——列宁写道——就一定要保卫社会主义祖国。”（列宁全集、第十二卷、五一○页）
    托洛茨基——布哈林匪帮进行破坏活动的得意手法之一，就是对苏维埃人民及其社会主义的成就的无终止的诽谤，和疯狂地宣传对资本主义西方的屈从。在他们的反爱国主义的狂热中，托洛茨基—布哈林党徒尽情地侮辱俄国人民，称之为“奥勃洛摩夫的民族”。他们宣称：列宁主义——俄国及全世界文化的最高成就，苏维埃人民的光荣和骄傲——是一种具有民族局限性的学说。这批人匍伏在资本主义西方的脚跟下，企图灭杀苏维埃人民对于社会主义胜利的信心，他们宣称：苏维埃人民以自身的力量不可能克服国家的技术与经济的落后，“落后的”俄国不可能赶上“前进的”欧洲。
    斯大林同志在揭发人民的仇敌托洛茨基—布哈林匪帮时说：他们是“一撮探子、刺客、仇敌，匍伏在外国人的脚下，对于每一个外国仆役都充满了俯首听命的奴才感情，并准备为他们做暗探工作，——这群人不晓得近来从资本家的枷锁中解放出来的苏维埃公民，比起任何一个背负着资本主义奴隶制的重担的外国高级仆役来，都要高过一头的……。”（“列宁主义问题”，五九○页）
    在与一切社会主义祖国的敌人——托洛茨基派、布哈林派、资产阶级民族主义者——作斗争的当中，列宁和斯大林指出，保卫着社会主义的祖国的无产阶级，在他们为社会主义祖国的忠诚服务与他们的国际主义任务中间，没有也不可能有任何的矛盾和分歧。
    苏维埃爱国主义是与无产阶级的世界主义不可分的，并且是与后者有机地连结在一起的。它是与苏联全体劳动者有切身利害的，各民族的民族传统有机地连结在一起的。苏维埃爱国主义凭借其自身社会主义的本质摈斥了民族与种族特殊性的任何种类的说教，任何民族主义及种族主义的偏见对于它都是生疏的。苏维埃的爱国主义与资产阶级的假爱国主义是截然的对立物，后者是从头至尾贯穿着民族主义与沙文主义的精神，它对于人民大众是生疏的。
    正如列宁所指，“国际主义并不是反民族的”。（列宁全集、第四版，二十一卷，二四五页）列宁的这一指示具有原则性的意义，因为它说明了无产阶级的国际主义与作为目前反动势力的思想旗帜的资产阶级世界主义是毫无共同之点的。
    “如果说国际主义是以对其他民族的尊重为基础的，那么我们不尊重或不热爱自己本国人民，就不能成为国际主义者。”（日丹诺夫）
    资产阶级的世界主义以其对于自己祖国与人民的命运及利益采取漠不关心的态度的宣教，及其对于各民族的真正爱国主义的嘲笑蔑视，只能够教养出一批为祖国所鄙视的商人来。
    布尔塞维克党，在苏联的社会主义建设的全部历史过程中，领导了并正在领导着最坚决的原则性的斗争，反对一切反爱国主义的现象，反对一切苏维埃人民与苏维埃文化的敌人。
    当与列宁主义的敌人所进行的斗争，一直就是为了争取我国沿着社会主义的途径发展，为了我国的自由和独立，为了社会主义的胜利而进行的深刻的爱国主义的斗争。在这样的斗争中，党培养了苏维埃人民对自己的创造力的无限信心，发展并培育了他们的苏维埃的爱国主义感情，他们自己的民族自尊心，及他们自身较之资产阶级世界的人民更为优越的认识。
    党揭发了对资本主义的西方阿谀奉承的、反爱国主义的、资产阶级的世界主义的实质，并指出：这种对外国人的奴隶性将不可避免地导向民族变节，导向叛卖苏维埃人民及社会主义的祖国的利益。揭发孤寡无亲的世界主义者的反爱国主义的集团，与资产阶级的世界主义作斗争，这充分地表现了布尔塞维克党是如何关心以苏维埃的生气蓬勃的爱国主义精神教育我国的劳动大众。
    联共（布）中央关于思想问题的决定与指示给与资产阶级思想的表现以歼灭性的打击，并动员了党及思想战线上的一切工作人员对资产阶级的影响进行不疲倦的斗争，为了加强布尔塞维克党性，及富有战斗精神的苏维埃爱国主义精神而斗争。联共（布）中央的这些决议与指示的目的是在于“加强苏维埃科学、文学、艺术中的党性，将我们社会主义的文化各部门—印刷、宣传、科学、文学、艺术——提升到新的、更高的水平”（马林可夫）。
