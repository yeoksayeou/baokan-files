　　Pottery Manufacturers Hold Symposium Yesterday
　　Discussing the Transition to Machine Production
　　Currently Working to Standardize Specifications and Remove Impurities from Clay Materials
    [This City News] The city's Industrial Association convened a symposium of pottery manufacturers yesterday (the 20th) to discuss the industry's current development of production, improvement of quality, and other issues. Responsible persons from more than a dozen manufacturers, including Jiuda and Hengxing, attended, and responsible personnel from the Industry and Commerce Bureau, Trade Guidance Committee, Labor Bureau, and Industrial Experiment Institute were sent to provide guidance. The industry currently has very good sales, with demand exceeding supply. Brick production in July was 140,000 pieces (due to rain, production was low), and brick production in August was 1.3 million pieces. The bricks are sold immediately after leaving the kiln. Currently, many government construction projects and private factories are placing orders with various kilns. All kilns are actively producing and striving to improve quality and specifications. Under the guidance of the Western Suburbs Engineering Office, they are studying the "four-T" brick with uniform dimensions for the city's production based on soil quality and sampling, with a length of 25 cm, width of 12 cm, and thickness of 6 cm, to facilitate unified calculations for engineering construction. At the meeting, manufacturers spoke enthusiastically, discussing how to move from the existing handicraft technical foundation to machine production, so that work would not be suspended due to rain, lack of sunlight, or cold weather, and manufacturing could continue throughout the year. Regarding the problem of removing impurities from clay materials, they hope that the Industrial Experiment Institute will provide technical assistance to ensure that the soil does not contain "ginger stone," to avoid explosions during firing or poor quality after firing. Responsible personnel from the Industry and Commerce Bureau and the Industrial Experiment Institute expressed their willingness to provide assistance as much as possible.

　　窑业厂商昨座谈
  　商讨走向机器生产
  　现正努力划一规格去除土料杂质
    【本市讯】本市工业会昨（二十日）召集窑工业厂商举行座谈会，讨论该业当前发展生产，改进品质等问题。到久大、恒兴等十几家厂商负责人，工商局、贸易指导委员会、劳动局、工业试验所等机关均派有负责人员出席指导。该业目前销路极好，供不应求，七月份产砖十四万块（因雨产量少），八月份产砖一百三十万块，砖出窑后立即销出。现在许多政府建筑工程及私营工厂均纷纷向各窑订货，各窑都在积极生产，并对品质和规格上力求改进。他们经过西郊工程处的指导后，正根据土质、抽分研究全市生产尺寸划一的“四丁字”砖，长二十五公分，宽十二公分，厚六公分，以便于工程建筑的统一计算。会上各厂商热烈发言，讨论怎样由现有的手工业技术基础走向机器生产，不因下雨，缺阳光、天冷而停工，一年四季都能制造。对解决土料中的杂质问题，他们希望工业试验所给予技术协助，使土质不含“姜石”，以免烧时爆炸，或烧好后质量不佳。工商局和工业试验所负责人员都表示尽量予以协助。
