　　A Record of Visits with Representatives to the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference
  　Dong Heting, the Heroic Factory Protector
    Qing Mei
    During the Liberation of the Tianjin-Peiping Campaign, the Tianjin No. 3 Textile Factory was preserved intact by the workers, becoming the people's property. Even before the People's Liberation Army's attacking forces reached the factory, the workers had already organized a security team. For four days and nights, they worked tirelessly, heroically guarding the factory, preventing the bandit gangs from entering and sabotaging it. The person responsible for leading this arduous factory protection work was Dong Heting, a weaving worker, who was also specially invited to attend the People's Political Consultative Conference as a representative of Tianjin.

    Dong Heting was originally a weaving worker at the Japanese-owned Tianjin Gongda No. 7 Factory. Unwilling to be oppressed by the enemy, he returned to his hometown of Wen'an County in 1941 to join the Eighth Route Army to resist Japan. He fought in the 38th Regiment for three years and was wounded twice. After Japan surrendered, he returned home to recuperate. Soon after, the 38th Regiment was ordered to go to the Northeast, and he was left behind. After recovering from his injuries, he participated in local work. The following spring, he went to Tianjin, worked in a yarn factory, and organized underground labor movements.

    Before the Tianjin-Peiping Campaign, he transferred to the No. 3 Textile Factory to work, starting to organize workers, protect the factory, and prepare to welcome liberation. On January 15th, when the People's Liberation Army launched a fierce general offensive against the defending enemy on the outskirts of Tianjin, Dong Heting deployed forces near the factory buildings to monitor the actions of the enemy defending inside the factory. By the afternoon of the 17th, the enemy in Tianjin announced its surrender on the radio, but local battles were still ongoing. Shells continued to fly over the factory, and the remnants of the enemy in Hedong had not yet completely laid down their weapons. At this time, in order to prevent the enemy from taking the opportunity to sabotage, Dong Heting led two workers, bravely entered the factory, seized the weapons of the defending enemy, and immediately summoned the workers remaining in the factory to organize a security team of more than twenty people, drove the yellow union members out of the factory, ensured order within the factory, and waited for the arrival of the People's Liberation Army.

    At more than ten o'clock late at night, more than thirty KMT bandit soldiers suddenly poured in from outside the factory, attempting to loot the people's property. In order to deal with this emergency, Dong Heting quickly directed the factory's security team to converge from all sides, while he calmly pretended to be a receptionist and stepped forward to greet the scattering soldiers, deliberately chatting with the leading bandit platoon leader, diverting the enemy's attention. When the worker security team shouted "Disarm!" from all sides, the enemy was caught off guard, panicked, and had no choice but to obediently become prisoners. As a result, the factory suffered no damage.

    In the darkness, the surrounding situation was unclear. To guard against the bandit scattering soldiers from coming again, Dong Heting strengthened the patrol work of the security team. They persevered in the tense atmosphere of battle. It wasn't until 1:30 a.m. that they made contact with the People's Liberation Army's attacking forces. The attacking forces took away the weapons and prisoners seized by the worker security team and continued to advance. Dong Heting and the entire worker security team continued to perform the factory protection task within the factory. Everyone carefully guarded the factory buildings and machines, not closing their eyes for four days and nights. It was not until the military control commission representatives came to the factory to take over that this glorious task was finally successfully completed.

    Four days and nights of tireless guarding left Dong Heting exhausted, and he finally fell ill the day after completing the factory protection task. It took more than three months of treatment to restore his strength. However, thanks to the heroic defense of Dong Heting and the worker security team, the people's No. 3 Textile Factory was not damaged by the bandits. On the fourth day of the military control commission's takeover, the factory continued to smoke and produce. More than three thousand workers throughout the factory happily returned to the factory to celebrate their liberation!

    This factory protector who has contributed to the people has thus become a glorious and beloved representative of the People's Political Consultative Conference!

　　中国人民政协代表访问记
  　英勇护厂的董和亭
    庆楣
    在解放平津战役中，天津中纺第三厂完整无恙地被工人们保存下来，成了人民的财产。当人民解放军攻城部队还未到达该厂以前，工人们早已组织起纠察队。整整四昼夜，他们废寝忘食，英勇地在那儿护守着，不让匪帮入厂破坏。负责领导这一艰巨护厂工作的是织布工人董和亭，也即是这次被人民政协会议特别邀请出席的天津代表。
    董和亭原先是日寇天津公大七厂的织布工人，因为不愿受敌人的欺压，四一年就回到家乡文安县，参加八路军抗日。在三十八团作战三年，先后挂了二次彩。日本投降后，他回家养伤。不久，三十八团奉令开赴东北，他就被留下。伤愈以后，他参加了地方工作。第二年春天，他到天津，在纱厂中工作，组织地下工运。
    平津战役以前，他转到中纺第三厂工作，着手组织工人，保护工厂，准备迎接解放。一月十五日，当人民解放军在天津外围向守敌发起猛烈总攻时，董和亭就在厂房附近布署力量，监视厂内守敌的行动。到了十七日下午，天津敌人在广播中宣告投降，但局部的战斗仍在继续进行。炮弹不断在工厂上空飞过，河东的残敌还没有全部放下武器。这时，董和亭为了不使敌人乘隙进行破坏，就率领两个工友，奋勇地进入工厂，收缴守敌的武装。并立刻召集留在厂内的工人，组织了一支二十余人的纠察队，把黄色工会分子驱逐出厂，确保了厂内的秩序，等待解放军来到。
    深夜十点多，突然从厂外涌进来三十多个国民党匪军散兵，企图抢劫人民的资财。董和亭为了应付这一紧急情况，就迅速指挥厂内的纠察队从各方集中，他自己却镇静地假装招待人员上前向散兵招呼，故意和领队的匪军排长扯谈，分散了敌人的注意力。等到前后左右的工人纠察队一声喝令“缴械！”敌人猝不及防，警惶失措，只好乖乖地成了俘虏。结果使工厂没有受到丝毫损失。
    在黑夜中，周围的情况不明。董和亭为提防匪帮散兵再来，就加强纠察队的巡逻工作。他们在紧张的战斗气氛中，一直坚持着。到了午夜一点半，才与解放军的攻城部队取得了连系。攻城部队把工人纠察队收缴的武器和俘虏带走，继续挺进。董和亭和全体工人纠察队仍在厂内执行护厂任务，大家周密地看守着厂房和机器，整整四昼夜没有合过眼。直到军管会代表来厂接管，这一光荣的任务终于胜利完成了。
    四昼夜的不懈守护，使董和亭疲乏过度，他终于在完成护厂任务的第二天病倒了，经过三个多月的治疗，才把体力复原过来。可是由于董和亭和工人纠察队英勇守卫的结果，使人民的中纺三厂未受匪帮任何破坏。在军管会接管的第四天，工厂就继续冒烟生产了，全厂三千多个工友，个个喜欢地回到厂里来，庆祝自己的解放！
    这位有功于人民的护厂者就是这样成为一个光荣的众人敬爱的人民政协代表！
