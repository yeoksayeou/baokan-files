　　Don't "Just..."
    Li Si

    "I know all these theories you're talking about, and I can even explain them better than you, but..." Then comes a frown, or a wry smile.

    We often hear and see such words and expressions. Whenever someone is expounding at length to me, I myself have felt similarly.

    In theory, I know that under the economic blockade of imperialism, under the persecution of floods and droughts in rural areas, under the needs of supporting the War of Liberation, and under the premise of restoring and developing production..., it is reasonable and necessary to launch a sustained and planned campaign of streamlining and economy. Every person has the responsibility or obligation to assist the government in completing this task, because helping the government establish a people's democratic republic is equivalent to helping ourselves. However, in concrete actions—when using state property, I don't pay much attention to cherishing and economizing. For example, when applying for people's scholarships, I consider my own situation much more thoroughly than the plight of the peasants, always feeling that my family isn't living comfortably enough!

    In theory, in words, I will also say: "We must unite with the masses, learn from the masses, and humbly accept the criticism of the masses." But, when it comes to practice, I feel that some masses are "too backward" and unity is really "difficult." In fact, I myself have never sincerely and enthusiastically approached others. "To bring into play the creativity and initiative of the masses" is even just a term from textbooks. In reality, I handle everything myself, which is simpler and more enjoyable!

    Saying much, doing little; theory "correct," action deviating, even running counter, this is the true nature of us—intellectuals who have not been well reformed.

    Liu Hulan would not say: "In theory, I should sacrifice for the people, but, my own life is precious..." She calmly went to her death. Labor heroes would not say: "In theory, building a new China is correct, but, we are suffering too much..." They silently developed production. Combat heroes would not say, "In theory, I know we must overthrow the reactionaries, but, our lives are too dangerous..." They fought bravely with the enemy with their own flesh and blood. They overcame "just..." and just started doing it, completing the tasks entrusted to them by the times and creating great historical feats.

    Let's stop lingering in "theory" alone. Let theory take root in our thoughts and actions! Use "action" to prove that we already know those "theories"! Get rid of those "just...", overcome the difficulties of those "just..."!

    We must not only revolutionize the enemy, but also revolutionize our own thinking.

### 不要“只是…”

　　不要“只是…”
    李思
    “你说的这些理论，我都知道，甚至还能比你讲得更好，只是……”接着不是皱眉，就是苦笑了。
    这样的话，这样的表情，我们常常可以听到，看到。每当人向我夸夸其谈时候，我自己也曾经有类似的心情。
    在理论上，我知道：在帝国主义的经济封锁下，在各地农村的水灾，旱灾的迫害下，在支援解放战争的需要下，在恢复与发展生产的前提下……，目前持久而有计划的展开精简节约运动是合理而且是必要的，每一个人民都有责任或义务来协助政府完成这项任务，因为帮助政府建立起人民民主的共和国，也就等于帮助了我们自己。只是，在具体的行动中——在使用国家的财物时，我是不大注意爱护和节约的。比如申请人民助学金时，考虑我自己的情形，比考虑农民的苦境要周到得多，总觉得自己家里过得不够宽裕！
    在理论上，在口头上，我也会说：“我们要团结群众，向群众学习，谦虚地接受群众的批评。”但，一到实践，就觉得有些群众“太落后”了，团结实在“困难”呢，其实，自己就不曾虚心热忱地去接近别人。“要发挥群众的创造性与积极性。”更只是书本子上的名词，实际上，凡事自己一手包办，简便，痛快得多！
    说得多，做得少；理论“正确”，行动偏差，乃至背道而驰，这便是我们——没有改造好的知识分子的本色。
    刘胡兰不会说：“在理论上，我是应当为人民牺牲，只是，我自己的生命可贵……。”她从容地就义了。劳动英雄们不会说：“在理论上，建设新中国是正确的，只是，我们可太吃亏…。”他们默默地发展了生产。战斗英雄们不会说“在理论上，我知道我们要打倒反动派，只是，我们的性命太危险…。”他们用自己的血肉和敌人英勇搏斗。他们克服了“只是…”而是就这样地干起来，完成了时代赋予他们的任务，创造了伟大的史迹。
    我们别再仅逗留在“理论”上了。让理论在我们的思想、行动里生根！拿“行动”来证实我们已经知道那些“理论”！去掉那些“只是…”，克服那些“只是…”的困难！
    我们不仅要革敌人的命，同时还要革自己思想上的命。
