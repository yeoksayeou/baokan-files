Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 9th: TASS published a commentary on the results of the Soviet, American, British, and French Foreign Ministers' Assistants meeting on the 7th, stating: As is well known, agreement was reached on a number of basic issues regarding the Austrian State Treaty at the Paris Foreign Ministers' meeting. The Foreign Ministers' meeting instructed the Foreign Ministers' Assistants to resume their work in order to reach an agreement on the entire draft Austrian State Treaty before September 1, 1949.

In July and August 1949, the Foreign Ministers' Assistants reviewed the unresolved clauses in the draft Austrian State Treaty. They reached an agreement on nine of them. These nine clauses included: the clause on guaranteeing the rights of the Slovene and Croat minorities (this draft was proposed by the Soviet Union), the clause on returning the property of UN member states, and the clause on the issue of Austrian assets in the territories of the Allied Powers, UN member states, and other countries. The Foreign Ministers' Assistants also resolved to delete from the draft treaty the clause on Germany's demands on Austria, the clause on contracts between Austria and Germany, and the clause on patent rights. However, the Foreign Ministers' Assistants failed to reach an agreement on another nine clauses, including clauses concerning German assets, UN member state assets in Austria, Austria's pre-war and post-war debts, and the issue of people abducted during the war.

What hindered the Foreign Ministers' Assistants from implementing the Foreign Ministers' meeting's decision? Why was an agreement still not reached on the draft Austrian State Treaty this time? The representatives of the Western countries, attempting to deviate from the Foreign Ministers' meeting's decisions on certain issues, hindered the successful completion of the preparation work for the draft Austrian State Treaty. This refers to the proposals made by the Western countries' representatives regarding the transfer of oil field exploration rights in Austria to the Soviet Union.

As is well known, at the Paris Foreign Ministers' meeting, it was decided that 60 percent of the oil exploration areas from German assets in eastern Austria should be transferred to the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union, according to the Potsdam Agreement, has the right to enjoy these assets and currently holds these assets. Although the Soviet representative's proposal on this issue was fully in line with the Foreign Ministers' meeting's aforementioned decision, the representatives of the United States, Britain, and France strongly opposed including certain oil field exploration areas in the list proposed by the Soviet representative, even though the list proposed by the Soviet representative was entirely composed of former German assets, and the Soviet Union's right to obtain concessions in these areas was indisputable.

The Western three countries' proposals regarding the transfer of oil refineries to the Soviet Union also deviated from the Paris Foreign Ministers' meeting's decision. The decision of the Paris Foreign Ministers' meeting stipulated that oil refineries with an annual oil production capacity of 420,000 tons should be transferred to the Soviet Union. However, the representatives of the United States, Britain, and France violated this decision and proposed transferring oil refineries with an annual oil production capacity of only 250,000 tons to the Soviet Union. The representatives of the Western countries particularly disputed the exclusion of the former German refinery in Lobau and the Lobau-Sistensdorf oil pipeline built by Germany during the war from the list of refineries that should be transferred to the Soviet Union.

The Paris Foreign Ministers' meeting decided that enterprises engaged in the sale of oil products located in eastern Austria and already held by the Soviet Union as war booty should be transferred to the Soviet Union. The Soviet representative submitted a list of the aforementioned enterprises. However, the representatives of the Western countries insisted, without any reason, on removing the Lobau oil supply base and the Lobau-Lubmin oil pipeline, formerly belonging to a German company, from the list.

As is well known, at the Paris Foreign Ministers' meeting, it was resolved that the Soviet Union should transfer to Austria the military industrial enterprises, houses, and similar immovable property located in Austria and belonging to the Soviet Union as war booty. However, the representatives of the United States, Britain, and France, disregarding the Foreign Ministers' meeting's aforementioned decision, insisted on handing over to Austria not only the immovable property war booty but also all movable property war booty belonging to the Soviet Union.

The representatives of the United States, Britain, and France, at the London meeting, suggested submitting an amendment to Article 42 of the draft Austrian State Treaty, which stipulated that Austria "must pay... timely, appropriate, and effective compensation" for assets formerly held by UN member states or their nationals but subsequently acquired by German companies. From the arguments put forward by the representatives of the United States, Britain, and France at the London meeting in support of this amendment proposal, it can be inferred that American and British companies had invested capital during the war against Germany to establish various enterprises on the territory of the enemy country (Austria). These enterprises had been used by the fascists for war purposes, and they had brought profits to American and British monopoly capital. But now, the representatives of the United States, Britain, and France are trying to obtain "effective compensation" from Austria for the capital their companies invested in German enterprises during the war, which also brought profits to these companies. The representatives of the United States, Britain, and France want to use this method to obtain compensation from Austria for the capital invested by American and British companies in German enterprises during the war. In reality, these investments have already been compensated by the Germans. Needless to say, the Soviet representative could not agree to this proposal by the Western representatives.

At the Assistants' meeting, the Soviet representative repeatedly pointed out that the successful completion of the preparation work for the Austrian State Treaty could only be achieved if the Assistants abide by the decisions passed by the Foreign Ministers' meeting in Paris. However, the above examples prove that the representatives of the Western countries violated the Foreign Ministers' meeting's decision on the Austrian State Treaty and put forward some unfounded proposals. Therefore, the Assistants failed to complete the drafting work for the Austrian State Treaty.

At the meeting on September 1st, the representatives of the United States, Britain, and France declared that they had no authority to continue working and proposed to suspend the Foreign Ministers' Assistants meeting. Therefore, further discussions on the various clauses and sections of the draft Austrian State Treaty that had not yet been agreed upon were interrupted.

### 阻挠完成对奥和约草案　美英法违反巴黎协议  塔斯社评四国外长助理会议的中断

　　阻挠完成对奥和约草案
  　美英法违反巴黎协议
    塔斯社评四国外长助理会议的中断
    【新华社北平九日电】塔斯社于七日发表关于苏美英法外长助理会议谈判结果的评论称：如所周知，对奥和约的若干基本问题，曾在巴黎外长会议上达成协议。外长会议指示外长助理会议重行进行其工作，以便在一九四九年九月一日之前达成关于整个对奥和约草案的协议。
    一九四九年七八两月间，外长助理们审议了对奥和约草案中未获协议的各条款。他们对于其中的九条达成协议。九条中包括：关于保障斯洛文及克罗特少数民族权利的条款（该条草案是由苏联提出的），关于归还联合国会员国财物的条款，关于在盟国、联合国会员国及其他国境内的奥人资产问题的条款。外长助理会议并议决从和约草案中删去关于德国对奥要求的条款，关于奥德之间契约的条款以及关于专利权的条款。可是，外长助理们未能对另外九条达成协议，其中包括关于德人资产问题，奥境联合国会员国资产问题，奥国战前及战后债务问题，战时被掳人民问题等条款。
    是什么阻碍了外长助理会议执行外长会议的决定呢？为什么对奥和约草案这次仍然没有达成协议呢？企图背离外长会议关于某些问题之决议的西方国家代表们，阻碍了对奥和约草案准备工作的胜利完成。这里所说的，是西方国家代表对于奥境油田探掘区特许权交予苏联问题所提的建议。
    如所周知，在巴黎外长会议上，曾决定自奥国东部德国资产中以百分之六十的石油探掘区移交给苏联，苏联根据波茨坦协定有权享有该项资产，并且现在持有该项资产。虽然苏联代表关于这一问题的建议完全符合外长会议的上述决定，但是，美、英、法三国代表却力阻将某些油田探掘区列入苏联代表所提出的清单中，尽管苏联代表所提出的清单全是前德国资产，而且苏联之取得这些地区之特许权的权利是无可置辩的。
    西方三国对于炼油厂移交苏联问题所提的建议，也同样是背离巴黎外长会议决议的。巴黎外长会议的决定中规定，将每年产油能力四十二万吨的炼油厂移交给苏联，而美、英、法三国代表却违背这一决定，建议将每年产油能力仅及二十五万吨的炼油厂移交给苏联。西方国家代表特别争执不将洛鲍地方的前德国炼油厂及德国在大战期间建造的洛鲍——锡斯特道夫油管列入应移交给苏联的炼油厂清单中。
    巴黎外长会议决定，位于奥国东部并已被苏联持有的经售油产品的企业，应移交给苏联。苏联代表提出了上述企业的清单。然而，西方国家的代表却没有任何理由地坚持要从清单中删去洛鲍石油供应基地以及以前属于德国公司的洛鲍卢勃尼兹油管。
    如所周知，在巴黎外长会议上，曾议决由苏联将奥境作为战利品而属于苏联的军事工业企业、房屋及同类不动产移交给奥国。然而，美、英、法三国代表，却不顾外长会议的上述决定，坚持不仅将不动产战利品并且将属于苏联的一切动产战利品都交给奥国。
    美、英、法三国代表在伦敦会议上建议提出对奥和约草案第四十二条的修正案，该条规定：奥国对昔时由联合国会员国或其国民所握有嗣后又被德国公司取得的资产，“必须支付……及时适当和有效的赔偿”。从美、英、法三国代表在伦敦会议上所提出以支持这一修正案建议的论据，可以推知，美国公司及英国公司，曾在对德战争期间投入资金在前敌国领土（奥国）上建立了各色企业，这些企业曾被法西斯党徒用于战争目的，它们曾给美国及英国垄断资本带来利润。可是现在，美、英、法三国代表却力图自奥国为他们的公司在战争期间投于曾经也给这些公司带来利润的德国企业的资本，取得“有效赔偿”。美、英、法代表们想用这样的方法，为美国和英国的公司在战时投于德国企业的资本自奥国取得赔偿。而实际上，这些投资已自德国人方面得到了赔偿。不用说，苏联代表不能够同意西方代表们的这种建议。
    在助理会议上，苏联代表曾反复指出，对奥和约的准备工作要成功地完成，只有助理们遵守外长会议在巴黎所通过的决定。但是，上述例子证明，西方国家代表们违背外长会议关于对奥和约的决定，提出了一些毫无根据的建议，助理们因此未能完成对奥和约的起草工作。
    在九月一日的会议上，美、英、法代表们声明，他们无权继续工作，并提议停止外长助理会议，因此，关于对奥和约草案尚未协议的各条各节的进一步讨论，遂告中断。
