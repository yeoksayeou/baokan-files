Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 7th: Guo Moruo, head of the Chinese delegation to the World Congress of Defenders of Peace, and deputy heads Liu Ningyi and Ma Yinchu, today sent a telegram of congratulations to the Americas Peace Conference currently being held in Mexico City. The text of the telegram is as follows:
To the Presidium of the Americas Peace Conference, Mexico City:
The Americas Peace Conference is implementing the great call of the World Peace Congress, uniting the democratic and peaceful forces of the people of the Americas to resolutely struggle and give a serious blow to the new war plans of the American imperialists, the chief culprits of the world's aggressive camp today. The victorious Chinese people are willing to join hands with you under the leadership of the Soviet Union. Our common goal pursued on both sides of the Pacific Ocean – lasting world peace – will surely be achieved. We wish your conference success.
Guo Moruo, Head of the Chinese Delegation to the World Congress of Defenders of Peace
Deputy Heads Liu Ningyi, Ma Yinchu, September 7th, Beiping

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 7th: The All-China Democratic Women's Federation sent a telegram on the 6th of this month to congratulate the Americas Peace Conference, which opened on the 5th of this month in Mexico City. The original telegram is as follows: Please forward to the Americas Peace Conference, dear friends, through the Secretariat of the International Democratic Women's Federation:
We, on behalf of the democratic women of all of China, extend our warm congratulations to your conference! And wish you success!
Due to the increasing strength of the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries, the unity of anti-war forces around the world headed by the Soviet Union, and the great victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War, the reactionary camp headed by American imperialism is panicking and resorting to conspiracies everywhere. At this moment, the All-Americas Peace Conference is being held in the place where the reactionary forces of American imperialism are the strongest, which shows that the peace movement in the Americas and the peace movement in the world are expanding unprecedentedly, like a dagger inserted into the heart of American imperialism. At the same time, the people of the Americas will take this conference as a starting point, further recognize the nature of American imperialism, strengthen their unity with the world's peace forces, oppose wars of aggression, and strive for world peace. We, the democratic women of China, will respond to the call of the World Peace Congress with practical efforts to oppose the United States and eliminate the remnants of its running dog, the Kuomintang reactionaries, and support you!
With warm regards!
Cai Chang, Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, September 6th

　  中华全国民主妇联亦电致贺
    【新华社北平七日电】出席世界和平拥护者大会的中国代表团团长郭沫若，副团长刘宁一、马寅初，今日致电祝贺现在墨西哥城举行的美洲和平大会。电文如下：
    墨西哥城美洲和平大会主席团：
    美洲和平大会执行世界和平大会的伟大号召，团结全美洲人民民主和平力量，坚决奋斗，给今天世界侵略阵营的首犯美帝国主义的新战争计划以严重的打击。胜利的中国人民愿在苏联领导下，与你们携手并进。我们在太平洋两岸所追求的共同目标——世界持久和平一定能够实现。敬祝你们大会的成功。
    出席世界和平拥护者大会中国代表团团长郭沫若
    副团长刘宁一、马寅初　九月七日北平
    【新华社北平七日电】中华全国民主妇女联合会于本月六日致电祝贺已于本月五日在墨西哥城召开的美洲和平大会。原电如下：国际民主妇联书记处请转全美洲和平大会亲爱的朋友们：
    我们代表全中国的民主妇女向贵会致热忱的祝贺！并预祝你们成功！
    由于苏联及新民主主义国家的日益强大，由于以苏联为首的全世界反战势力的团结一致，由于中国人民解放战争的伟大胜利，使得以美帝国主义为首的反动阵营惊慌失措，到处施用其阴谋。正当此时，全美和平大会在美帝国主义反动势力最雄厚的地方召开，这说明了美洲的和平运动与世界的和平运动空前扩展，犹如一把匕首插进美帝国主义的心腑。同时，全美洲的人民将以此大会为起点，更认清美帝国主义的本质，更加强与全世界和平力量的团结，反对侵略战争，争取世界和平。我们中国民主妇女将以反对美帝及肃清其走狗国民党反动派残余的实际努力来响应世界和平大会的号召，并支援你们！
    致以热烈的敬礼！
    中华全国民主妇女联合会主席蔡畅　九月六日
