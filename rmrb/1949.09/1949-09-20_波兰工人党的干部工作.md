　　Cadre Work of the Polish Workers' Party
    Z. Nowak, Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party

    One of the major tasks that the Polish People's government and the Party faced immediately after liberation, and still face now, has been to discover trained cadres. In the past five years, the Party's cadre work has been successful; we have been able to mobilize the working class and peasantry to rebuild Poland from the chaos left by fascism. And thanks to the correct policy towards mental laborers, the majority of them, especially technical personnel, have also been absorbed into construction work.

    The right-wing nationalist tendencies that influenced some of our Party's leaders had a bad influence on the policy of selecting and training cadres. The political qualities of some people were often not properly vetted before they were assigned to responsible positions. As a result, some alien elements sneaked into our economic and administrative organs, and even into the Party's organs, affecting the work.

    In the struggle against right-wing tendencies, especially after the August 1948 Central Committee Plenum, important measures were taken to overcome these shortcomings.

    The Central Committee is now concentrating great attention on training cadres and raising the ideological level of Party members. Previously, there were two Central Party Schools—a one-year Party School in Warsaw and a half-year Party School in Łódź; there were also sixteen three-month district Party committee Party Schools, and more than a thousand Party evening schools throughout the country, with a total of 80,000 participants, and 750 rural areas had training classes for Party activists. The Central Organization Department considered the Party school distribution network to be insufficient and drafted some measures to improve the training of Party activists, deciding to extend the district Party committee Party Schools to six months, the Łódź Party School to one year, and the Warsaw Party School to two years.

    However, the serious lack of cadres for leadership work in state organs, in industry, and in rural work cannot be solved simply by establishing schools. To overcome the lack of cadres, the Party is selecting more capable and progressive workers and promoting them to leadership positions. This policy must be implemented even more boldly. This will strengthen the leadership role of the working class in People's Poland.

    After the August Plenum of the Central Committee, the rate of cadre promotion in industry increased significantly. Party organizations at all levels recognized the importance of this work and began to pay more attention. More importantly, they changed from randomly promoting cadres in the past to a more organized approach. According to incomplete figures as of April 1 this year, more than 15,000 workers have been assigned to managerial and administrative work at various levels. Among them, 3,646 were textile workers, 2,925 were miners, and more than 2,000 were metalworkers.

    The achievements of the Pokój Steel Factory are very significant. The Party Committee launched political and technical training for the selected cadres. Of the thirty workers who recently completed their studies, eighteen have been promoted to foremen and deputy foremen, and the others have been retained as reserves. The task of helping and caring for the new cadres is given to the most outstanding experts. In the Pokój factory, there are already eighteen such experts, each taking care of a small group, with each group having several people.

    One of the main tasks of the Party Committee is to pay constant, daily and hourly attention to the promotion of new comrades; however, there are still examples of bureaucracy and lack of concern for these workers.

    After the August Plenum, there was a great change in the work of selecting cadres in the countryside. In the past, right-wing representatives often called exploiting kulaks "good peasants." Due to this right-wing opportunist view, "good peasants" occupied positions in some peasant mutual aid societies, regional cooperatives run by mutual aid societies, and the leadership committees of regional people's representative conferences; they even infiltrated the Party's grassroots organizations. Much work has already been done to expel kulaks from rural organizations. According to incomplete figures, 8,220 kulaks have been expelled from the local branches of peasant mutual aid societies, and 6,111 kulaks have been expelled from regional cooperative organizations; these positions have all been filled by active poor and middle peasants. Although some "cautious" comrades predicted that cooperatives and peasant associations would not be able to function without the help of those "good peasants," these organizations are progressing rapidly. Poor and middle peasants have realized that these are truly their own organizations and actively support them. Kulaks have also been expelled from regional people's representative conferences.

    Because we have shown insufficient class vigilance in selecting rural cadres, the managers and administrators of state farms have for a long time been former landlords—appointed when Mikołajczyk was Minister of Agriculture. Therefore, it is not surprising that incidents of sabotage have occurred here. In 1948, 316 agricultural workers were assigned to these positions, and now they are victoriously developing state farms and increasing profits.

    Now, thousands of workers and poor peasants have been sent to positions in state work, municipal work, state-owned enterprises, and cooperatives.

    Before the war, Polish universities were only open to the children of the privileged classes; even after the war, this influence still lingered. In 1947, only 4% of students in universities came from working-class families, and 1% from poor peasant families. The proportion in secondary schools was only slightly higher.

    To develop the people's intelligentsia, universities have been reorganized. Preparatory courses and one-year entrance classes have been established for young people who do not have a university diploma; as a result, there has been a great change in the composition of students. This year, 88% of students participating in preparatory studies, 69% of students studying in entrance classes, and 49.5% of first-year university students are from working-class and poor peasant families. Undoubtedly, this is a major success for the Party. However, this is not enough. The Party is very concerned about further changing the social composition within universities because there is much important construction work to be done, and the sharp class struggle makes it necessary to quickly train theoretically mature cadres.

    To achieve the goals of the Six-Year Plan put forward by the United Workers' Party Congress, 800,000 to 900,000 skilled workers, 80,000 to 90,000 technicians, and 24,000 engineers are needed. Thousands upon thousands of agricultural economists, tractor drivers, cooperative chairmen, and accountants are needed in the countryside to transform agriculture. We must be able to train 7,500 doctors, 20,000 primary and secondary school teachers, 2,000 university faculty members and scientific workers, and 1,000 workers in other cultural departments in order to develop education, culture, and public health in a planned way. Achieving the Six-Year Plan means training thousands upon thousands of local government workers, cooperative workers, and trade union workers—people who can cope with the ever-growing tasks, overcome difficulties, and break any conspiracies of the class enemy.

    This problem is very important for the successful completion of the plan, and the Party is concentrating its efforts to solve it. Various training classes are being opened throughout the country. This year, approximately 400,000 people are participating in training classes for specialists and agricultural personnel; 475,800 people are studying in other schools, including more than 35,000 who are being trained to become teachers. Currently, the number of university students is twice what it was before the war.

    However, our cadre work is not good enough, and the cadre departments are not sound. Their work is not planned, and they have not yet overcome the phenomenon of acting as a kind of "intermediary agency." Some Party committees have not realized that to successfully cultivate cadres, the basic work should be done in organs and enterprises, guided and supervised by the Party's cadre departments. Many leading cadres in various departments have not realized that they themselves bear the responsibility for cadre work.

    A serious shortcoming in past cadre work was the lack of coordination in assigning work to new cadres. Sometimes, they were assigned unsuitable jobs, or cadres were attracted with higher salaries and better working conditions. There was a reluctance to boldly entrust work to women. The recent Central Committee Plenum emphasized the need to strengthen the work of women activists.

    The Central Committee has put forward the task to the whole Party of strengthening the work of training, cultivating, and deploying cadres, and the work of giving specialists political training in the spirit of Marxism-Leninism has begun. The work items that must be assigned through the comrades of Party committees at all levels have been stipulated. This allows Party committees to concentrate their attention on decisive links.

    As the class struggle intensifies, the vigilance of Party committees in selecting and vetting cadres has been strengthened. Measures for creating reserves have been adopted. Without reserves, there is no possibility of planned activity in this work. Currently, great attention is being paid to the selection of cadres for departments and sections.

    The cadre problem is one of the most serious and important problems facing the Party. We can only solve this problem by improving the work of educating, training, and deploying cadres and utilizing the rich experience of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. This is increasingly felt within our Party and all its organizations.

　　波兰工人党的干部工作
    波兰统一工人党中央委员Ｚ．诺瓦克
    波兰人民政权和党，在解放以后，即刻面对着的一项重大任务，曾经是和现在仍然是要发现受过训练的干部。过去五年中，党底干部工作是有成绩的；我们能够动员了工人阶级和农民，在法西斯遗留的混乱中重建波兰。并且由于对脑力劳动者采取了正确的政策，他们底大部分，特别是技术人员，也已经被吸收到建设工作中来了。
    右的民族主义底偏向影响了我们党底一部分领导，这对于选择与训练干部的政策起了一种坏影响。一些人底政治品质往往未经适当的审查，就被派担任负责的工作。结果，一些异己分子就钻进了我们经济和行政机构中去，甚至于到党底机构里来，影响了工作。
    在反对右倾的斗争过程中，特别是在一九四八年八月中央全会以后，采取了克服这些缺点的重要措施。
    中央现在正集中很大的注意力于训练干部和提高党员底思想水平。在这以前，有两个中央党校——在华沙的一年制党校，和在洛治的半年制党校；还有十六个三个月的区党委党校，在各地有一千多个党课夜校，总计八万人参加，七百五十个乡区有了党员积极分子训练班。中央组织部认为党校分布网还不够，就草拟了一些提高党员积极分子的办法，决定延长区委党校到六个月，延长洛治党校到一年，延长华沙党校到二年。
    可是，在国家机构，在工业和乡村工作中，领导工作的干部底严重缺乏问题，单是建立学校，还不能解决。为了克服干部缺乏，党正选择比较有能力而前进的工人，提拔作领导工作。这一政策还必须更大胆地执行。这将会加强工人阶级在人民波兰底领导作用。
    在中央八月全会以后，在工业方面，提拔干部的速率大大地增加了。各级党组织认识了这个工作底重要性，便开始更多注意。更重要的是，他们由过去的随便提拔干部，改变为有组织的办法。根据今年四月一日为止的不完全数字，一万五千多工人已被派作经理及各级行政工作。其中有三千六百四十六人是纺织工人，二千九百二十五人是矿工，和二千多金属工人。
    波克齐钢铁工厂底成绩是很有意义的。党委发动了给被选拔的干部的政治和技术的训练。三十个最近学习完了的工人中，十八个已被提拔做了领班和副领班，其他的人留作后备。把帮助和照顾新干部的任务，给予最优秀的专家。在波克齐工厂中，已有十八个这样的专家，他们每个人照顾一小组，每组大概有几个人。
    党委主要任务之一，就是经常地、每日每时地注意提拔新的同志；而现在仍然有一些官僚主义和不关心这些工作人员的例子。
    八月全会以后，乡村中选择干部的工作，有了很大的转变。过去，右倾的代表们常称剥削的富农为“好农民”，由于这种右倾机会主义底观点，“好农民”便占据了某些农民互助会，和互助会办的区域合作社，以及区域人民代表会议的领导委员会的职位；甚至于钻进党底基层组织中去。从乡村组织中驱逐富农的工作，是已经做了许多。据不完全的数字，有八千二百二十个富农被驱逐出了农民互助会的地方分会，从区域合作机关驱逐了六千一百十一个富农；这些位置都由积极的贫农和中农充任了。虽然一些“谨慎”的同志预言：如果没有那些“好农民”底帮助，合作社和农会就不能工作；可是，这些组织却在很快地进步。贫农和中农体验到了这些真正是他们自己底组织，积极地拥护它们。富农也被驱逐出了区域人民代表会。
    因为我们在选择乡村干部时，表现了阶级警惕性不够，国营农场底经理和行政人员，曾经有很长一个时期是旧地主——米柯拉齐克作农业部长时所委派的。所以，在这儿有怠工的事件发生，就不足为奇了。一九四八年，三百十六个农业工人被委派到这些岗位上去，现在，他们正胜利地发展着国营农庄，并且获利也在增加。
    现在，派了几千工人和贫农到国家工作，市政府工作，国营企业和合作社工作底岗位上去。
    战前的波兰，高等学校只是为那些特权阶级底子女而开设的；一直到战后，这影响还残存着哩。一九四七年，在高等学校里，只有百分之四的学生的家庭成分是工人，百分之一是贫农，中等学校比例只稍微高一些。
    为了发展人民底知识分子，大学都改组了。对于那些没有入大学文凭的青年，设立了预科和一年底入学班；因此，在学生成份方面，已有了很大的不同。本年，百分之八十八参加预科学习的学生，百分之六十九在入学班学习的学生，和百分之四十九·五的大学一年级学生，都是工人阶级和贫农家庭出身。毫无疑问地，这是党的重大成功。但是，这还不够得很，党非常关心进一步变更高等学校内的社会成份；因为，有许多重要的建设工作必须完成，而且尖锐的阶级斗争，有必要赶快训练一些理论上成熟的干部。
    为了实现统一工人党底代表大会所提出的六年计划底目标，就需要八十万到九十万熟练工人，八万到九万技师，和二万四千工程师。乡村中要有成千成万的农业经济家，拖拉机司机，合作社主席和会计，才能改造农业。我们要能训练医生七千五百人，中小学教师二万人，高等学校教员及科学工作者二千人，及其他文化部门底工作者一千人，才能有计划地发展教育、文化和公共卫生。实现六年计划，意味着训练成千成万的地方政府工作人员，合作社和工会底工作人员——一些能够应付在每天生长着的任务，能够克服困难，打破阶级敌人底任何阴谋诡计的人们。
    这个问题，对胜利地完成计划是很重要的，党正集中力量来解决它。全国各地正在开办各种训练班。今年专门家和农业人员底训练班，大约四十万人参加；四十七万五千八百人在其他学校学习，其中包括受训以后充当教师的三万五千多人。现在，高等学校底学生，已两倍于战前了。
    但是，我们的干部工作还不够好，干部科都还不健全。他们底工作不是有计划的，他们还不能克服充当某种“居间的机关”的现象。有些党委还没有认识到，要成功地培养干部，基本的工作应该在机关和企业中去作，由党底干部科指导和监督。许多部门的领导干部没有认识到，他们自己本身负着干部工作底责任。
    在干部工作中以往的严重缺点是：在分配工作给新干部时，缺少配合。有些时候，就产生了分配给他们不适合的工作，甚至于以较高的薪金，较好的工作条件等等来拉干部。对于妇女不敢大胆地将工作岗位交给她们。最近中央全会着重提出了对妇女积极分子的工作有加强的必要。
    中央向全党提出了加强训练、培养和配备干部的工作任务，给予专门家以马列主义精神的政治训练的工作已开始了。哪些是必需经过各级党委同志才能委派的工作项目，已经规定好了。这可以使党委集中注意力于有决定性的环节。
    随着阶级斗争日益尖锐化，党委选择干部和审查干部的警惕性已经加强了。制造后备的措施已经采用了。如果没有后备，在这一工作中就没有计划活动的可能。现在，对于部科底干部底选择，是非常注意的。
    干部问题是摆在党面前最严肃和重要的问题之一。我们只有改进教育、训练和配备干部的工作，利用联共党底丰富经验，才能够解决这个问题。在我们党内及其一切的组织中，这一点是日益感觉到了。
