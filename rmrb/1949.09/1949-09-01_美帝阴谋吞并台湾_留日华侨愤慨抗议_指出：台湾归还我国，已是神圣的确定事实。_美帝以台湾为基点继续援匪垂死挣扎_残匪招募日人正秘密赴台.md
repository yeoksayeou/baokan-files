　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 31st: Tokyo dispatch: The U.S. imperialist plot to annex Taiwan has aroused resolute opposition from overseas Chinese in Japan. The Federation of Overseas Chinese in Japan issued a statement on the 29th, pointing out that any attempt to make Taiwan independent, place it under Allied military control, or internationalize its administration is a vicious plot that disregards the will of the Taiwanese people. The statement said: Although a peace treaty with Japan has not yet been signed, the return of Taiwan to our country has been clearly stipulated in the Cairo and Potsdam Declarations, and like the return of Sakhalin Island to the Soviet Union, it is already a sacred and undeniable fact.
    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 31st: U.S. imperialism is continuing to aid the Kuomintang bandit gang through Taiwan in a counter-revolutionary struggle, and is vigorously promoting its plan for cooperation among reactionary factions in China, Japan, and South Korea, using Taiwan as a base. According to a United Press dispatch from San Francisco on the 24th, Dr. Harlan Paul, the Rockefeller Foundation's representative in China and Taiwan, revealed that the Kuomintang government is still receiving U.S. weapons, and ships sailing from the Pacific coast are unloading weapons at Keelung Port in Taiwan. These weapons are being used to equip the large number of Kuomintang troops stationed in Taiwan, but the morale of the Taiwanese army is low. According to a report in the Kuangming Daily on the 27th, citing news from Hong Kong, the Kuomintang bandit gang is colluding with MacArthur in Japan to recruit Japanese people who are secretly entering Taiwan. Cao Shizheng, who recently took office in Tokyo as the head of the First Group of the Kuomintang bandit gang's delegation to Japan, has dispatched his group member Chen Shaokai to frequently contact Okamura Neiji, the chief Japanese war criminal who invaded China, to secretly discuss the issue of recruiting Japanese people to Taiwan to assist Chiang in the war. It is said that when Chiang Kai-shek released Okamura Neiji back to Japan, he discussed the issue of recruiting Japanese people with Okamura Neiji. The Kuomintang's Taipei "New Life Daily" published an editorial on the 24th, openly expressing the shameless argument of "common interests between China and Japan" and "people of China and Japan should pay attention to how they can mutually protect themselves in terms of security," and said that it is necessary to "seek economic adjustment between the two countries" and "strive for ways to learn from each other in politics." In addition, Min Seok-rin, the first Consul General of the South Korean puppet regime stationed in Taiwan, also made a clamor against the Chinese people, saying that it is necessary to prevent "the aggression of new ambitious countries."

    【新华社北平三十一日电】东京讯：美帝国主义企图吞并台湾的阴谋活动，引起留日华侨的坚决反对。留日华侨联合会二十九日发表声明，指出：任何想使台湾独立，或交盟国军事管制，或由国际共管的企图，都是不顾台湾人民意志的恶毒阴谋。声明说：对日和约虽然还没有签订，但是台湾的归还我国，已在开罗和波茨坦宣言内明白规定，和库页岛的归还苏联一样，已经是神圣的确定事实。
    【新华社北平三十一日电】美帝国主义正经过台湾继续援助国民党匪帮进行反革命挣扎，并以台湾为基点，极力推行其中日韩反动派合作计划。据合众社旧金山二十四日消息披露：美洛克菲勒基金会在中国和台湾的代表哈兰·保罗博士称：国民党政府刻仍得到美国的武器，从太平洋海岸驶出的船只，在台湾的基隆港卸下武器。这些武器被用来装备台湾的大量国民党守军，但台湾军队的士气是低落的。另据此间光明日报，二十七日载香港消息：国民党匪帮勾结麦克阿瑟在日本招募的日人正秘密进入台湾。最近到东京就任国民党匪帮驻日代表团第一组组长曹士征已派出他的组员陈绍凯经常与日本侵华首要战犯冈村宁次联络，密商征募日人到台助蒋作战的问题，据说蒋介石释放冈村宁次回日时，即曾与冈村宁次谈到招募日人的问题。国民党台北“新生报”二十四日社论已公开发出“中日利害共同”“中日两国人士应注意如何在安全上可以互保”的无耻论调，并说要“谋求两国经济调节”，“在政治上力求切磋砥砺之道”。此外，南韩傀儡政权驻台首任总领事闵石麟亦作反对中国人民的叫嚣，并说什么要防止“新的野心国家之侵略”。
