[By Our Reporter in Harbin, 22nd] The news of the opening of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in Beiping immediately plunged the 800,000 people of Harbin in northern Manchuria into joyous celebration. At 10:00 AM, when the extra edition of the Songjiang Daily was distributed on the streets, many people rushed to read the long-awaited good news. Crowds gathered in front of blackboards, all saying in unison: "We've been waiting and waiting, and finally our Central People's Government is established!" When the news reached the factories, the workers immediately erupted in cheers of "Long live Chairman Mao!" To express their celebration, the workers of the Northeast Military Supply Bureau's Rubber Shoe Factory voluntarily produced ten to twenty extra pairs of shoes per person per day. Some factory workers voluntarily saved a portion of their money to support the front lines. People from all sectors of industry and commerce in Harbin also spread the word: This CPPCC includes representatives from all fields; China has not seen such genuine democracy in decades. When the Korean minority in Harbin heard that representatives of the Korean nationality were participating in the CPPCC, they all expressed their sincere gratitude for the Chinese People's Government and the Chinese Communist Party's policies towards ethnic minorities. At 5:00 PM, the Harbin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a grand lantern festival in the open-air plaza of Zhaolin Park in Daoli, to solemnly celebrate the beginning of the great undertaking of the founding of the People's Republic of China. The entire city has now been adorned in dazzling attire, with red flags waving and colorful lanterns hanging high everywhere. The cheers of the people and the thunderous sounds of gongs and drums have intertwined into one, overflowing the banks of the Songhua River.
