It Is Essential to Learn to Summarize Experience
(By K. Khidalev, translated by Ye Qun)

The Bolshevik worldview is consistent and complete. It resolutely opposes the separation of theory and practice, words and deeds at all times. It always pays special attention to studying and summarizing the special significance of practical work experience; it always pays special attention to how to study, with a creative spirit, the experience accumulated by the Party itself and the masses under the Party's leadership in the struggle to build a communist society. This attitude toward the surrounding affairs arises entirely from a vivid, revolutionary Bolshevism.

Comrade Stalin, when discussing the Mensheviks, pointed out that their fundamental error was the inconsistency between words and deeds and treating Marx's doctrine with a dogmatic attitude; they did not seek instructions and guidelines in analyzing actual life, but sought instructions and guidelines in similar matters and similar things in history.

The Bolshevik method is different from this in principle. "The Bolsheviks do not seek instructions and guidelines in similar things and similar matters in history, but seek instructions and guidelines from studying the actual situation around them" (Stalin). The Bolshevik Party in its work "does not base itself on citations and clichés, but bases itself on practical experience, and examines every step of its work with experience. It learns from its mistakes and educates others to build a new life."

This explains why one of the most important requirements that Comrade Stalin places on our cadres is that they should not become rigid in one place when carrying out practical work, should not stagnate in ready-made fixed forms, but should constantly study experience and carry out leadership with a creative spirit. So-called creative leadership is to study practical experience based on Marxist-Leninist theory, summarize practical experience, and be good at applying these experiences to daily work. A leader who is not good at combining daily practical work with his understanding of experience will inevitably lag behind and fall into the danger of losing awareness of new things.

Party workers—that is, political leaders—should carry out leadership with a far-reaching political vision, should be good at grasping and mastering the precise figures of all events and all aspects of things, and should be good at distinguishing between essential and non-essential phenomena, major and minor issues, general and individual circumstances. Only in this way can a correct evaluation of the work be given, and correct conclusions can be drawn. Making a summary without profound understanding, simply reciting the work that has been done in a straightforward manner, is not enough for a political leader, no matter how important. The characteristics of a political leader should be to summarize practical problems and practical tasks, integrate them into one, critically understand the road that has been experienced, and draw experience and lessons from it for future work. This is also of utmost importance for preventing errors. Lenin once said: "We should constantly conduct self-examination, study the entire course of events, clarify the causes and consequences of things, and analyze yesterday's mistakes so that we can learn from them how to avoid the mistakes of today and tomorrow." (Complete Works of Lenin, Volume 21, page 215)

However, we cannot say that all our Party organizations have paid due attention to summarizing practical experience. Unfortunately, there are still some Party workers who still adopt an indifferent attitude toward this matter. They are immersed in daily affairs all day long, not giving themselves a chance to think about their own practical work, not thinking about what new problems have occurred in life? How to understand and analyze these problems and facts that occur every day? If such a leader encounters a shortcoming in a work department, he will inevitably take it as his responsibility to strive to correct these shortcomings. However, he rarely thinks about what caused these shortcomings? The real reasons that contributed to the shortcomings? And what measures should be taken to prevent these shortcomings from recurring in future work? It is obvious that such a leader is a leader who cannot see the primary problems.

When some Party workers must reluctantly make a work report for a certain period of time, whether long or short, when they must mention the entire work environment, criticize the work, and must draw certain conclusions, their weakness in not being good at summarizing work becomes more obvious. Here it is also exposed that we have some leaders and good practitioners who seem to be capable, but in reality are not capable of analyzing the actual situation of the organization, not capable of summarizing work, not capable of distinguishing all the complex problems, and not capable of proposing concrete solutions. These workers usually take the easiest, most convenient, and most able to avoid difficulties shortcuts; they are usually most easily satisfied with materials that are nine-tenths made up of facts and examples, and most of these examples and facts are accidental and atypical.

Let us give such an example! This year, the city of Bezhitsa in the Bryansk Oblast held the city's Party representative conference. Some work reports were made at the conference, and the Bezhitsa City Committee also made a work summary report at the conference. This report seemed not to have missed any problems, and all the problems were mentioned. However, many representatives were not satisfied with this summary report and raised many criticisms and accusations against it. The vast majority of speakers believed that it was necessary to point out the shortcomings of this report. If we want to synthesize everyone's opinions on the report, then borrowing a representative's words can well express the essence of these opinions. He said: This report "did not mention any principled issues, but there was no analysis of the work carried out by the Party organization."

To ask whether these representatives' accusations against the city committee's summary report are correct? We answer: This is correct. Because the city committee's summary report formally described all the problems; however, the only things used to explain the problems were facts, examples, and figures. All the materials related to the facts were formally listed and piled up: such as the number of organization members? Where, how many Communist Party members are there? The deadline for probationary members to become full members? What issues did the city committee discuss? How is the work in the enterprise sector? etc.

Perhaps some people will say that a summary report without these specific materials will inevitably become generalized and empty. But we say that a summary report can in no way be a summary or catalog of facts. It should be a document that analyzes the actual work of the Party organization during a certain period, a document that summarizes the experiences and lessons of Party and economic construction, and a document that exposes and dissects errors and shortcomings in the work. However, the above is precisely what the Bezhitsa City Committee's summary report lacks. In the city committee's summary report, almost no analysis and summary was conducted. The facts and figures it cited are only rigid facts and figures. These facts and figures have no internal connection with the situation of the Party organization, cannot explain any problems, and cannot prove any problems.

In order to make a summary, one must be good at analyzing and studying all aspects of phenomena and things, be good at placing phenomena or facts in appropriate positions, and clarify its relationship with all events. For this reason, one must look at these facts critically, be good at identifying and clarifying what problems the facts cited are intended to explain? What can be proven and negated by citing this fact? Is this fact accidental or typical? That is to say, one must consider whether citing this fact can well explain and reflect the basic tendencies and basic processes.

Life is so rich, so diverse and multifaceted, it is not difficult for us to find as many suitable positive or negative facts and examples for any problem. However, if these examples are used casually, picked up at random, have no internal connection with basic things, and are not organized and analyzed, then these facts and examples can only be raw, rigid materials. It not only cannot explain any comprehensive practice and experience, but also can lead us to wrong conclusions. Lenin once said:

"In terms of social phenomena, nothing can be as sensational for a while and as likely to encounter serious bankruptcy as boasting about individual facts and playing with examples. Accumulating examples in general is not a particularly difficult task, but this behavior has no meaning. Facts, if placed in its entirety, placed in context, are not only 'stubborn' but also unconditionally able to prove the truth. Facts, if separated from its entirety, placed outside of context, if it is fragmented, picked up at random, used casually, then it can only be equal to a toy or worse than nothing..." (Complete Works of Lenin, Volume 30, page 303) In order to avoid these situations, we must take typical phenomena, facts, and examples, and we should carefully study and summarize these phenomena, facts, and examples.

Not being good at selecting facts that can represent certain characteristics and have typical significance from many facts is often due to our staff's unwillingness to do this important and delicate work; unwillingness to think carefully and understand the material. The habit of forcibly attaching some facts to speeches and piling up unnecessary figures and materials is very prevalent here. Everyone knows that these reluctantly attached facts and unnecessary numerical materials can only embellish and decorate speeches, but cannot add any new content to the speeches.

At the Party Congress of Bezhitsa City, many Communist Party members severely criticized the city committee's summary report and pointed out that the city committee staff did not regard the summary report as a document that correctly analyzed the Party's work. However, a worse situation is that some of our speeches only follow the stereotyped old formulas, and they don't care at all what problems need to be summarized in this speech and what problems need to be raised. For example: The Velikie Luki Oblast Party Committee recently discussed the election work and how to allocate and train cadres at an expanded meeting of the Oblast Committee. In addition to the report by the Oblast Committee Secretary on the issue of cadres, there were also speeches by the secretaries of the Belus and Opochka District Committees. Their reports and speeches were still a catalog of numbers and examples; still a list of cadres' names such as "who works well" or "who has not correctly completed the task," etc. In their reports, they did not put forward any well-considered methods and plans for how to carry out the cadre work in the district and department, and how to carry out the work of the chairmen of collective farms, these important cadre issues. The issue of training cadres, although proposed as a separate part, this part mainly talked about only the numbers of how many political schools have been established, how many lectures have been held, and how many students have been trained.

However, at this expanded meeting of the Oblast Committee, no one conducted any minimum necessary criticism of the Belus and Opochka District Committee Secretaries' unserious attitude in preparing their speeches. Perhaps the District Committee Secretary will excuse himself by saying that he is citing the Oblast Committee Secretary's report on the issue of cadres. But we say: Even the Oblast Committee Secretary's report on the issue of cadres also did not show any characteristics of profound summary and clear conclusions. As a report on the issue of cadres by an Oblast Committee Secretary, it is very insufficient. It lacks a program of active action significance, that is, it has completely formalized the practical question of "what do we need to do?" For example, when he talked about how to carry out the work of cadres such as the chairmen of collective farms, he came to the conclusion that "we must change the attitude of the District Committee and the District administrative organs towards the chairmen of collective farms." But when they talked about tractor drivers, mechanics, and combine harvesters, they would reuse this formula again. He said—"We should change our attitude towards the work of training machine operator cadres." When they mentioned industrial cadres, they abstractly said "It is necessary to change the attitude of the leaders of economic and construction organs towards cadres."

This inability to analyze and not being good at summarizing is often linked to another shortcoming in the speeches of some Party workers, that is, the lack of the spirit of sharply raising questions and Bolshevik criticism and self-criticism. Everyone knows that it is not enough to simply admit mistakes. The most important condition for conducting truly effective criticism is not only to admit mistakes, but also to analyze the reasons that caused the mistakes and shortcomings, and point out the methods of correction. Analyzing and dissecting the causes of mistakes is precisely to make everyone understand why mistakes were made, to draw experience and lessons from them, and to take certain measures to prevent such mistakes from being repeated in future work. If we simply list the shortcomings in the work and the mistakes in the leadership, without analyzing and exploring the causes of the mistakes, and without pointing out the ways to correct the mistakes, then we can judge that this department has less of the true Bolshevik spirit of self-criticism than any other department.

Summarizing experience is the most important sign of political leadership. Unwillingness or not being good at summarizing practical work and accumulating experience—is the most dangerous phenomenon for Party work. Our workers at all levels are often busy with thousands of large and small affairs. If we these workers do not give ourselves a chance to think about it often, do not often think about what new problems have occurred in life, and do not understand the specific situation and practical work, then we have no guarantee that the practical spirit of these staff members will not become narrow empiricism, and there is no guarantee that their sense of career will not become only chasing after the immediate interests of transactionalism.

A high degree of ideality in work and a spirit of continuous learning are the keys to summarizing practical work and understanding the actual situation. The weakness of summarizing ability is usually related to insufficient theoretical cultivation. Thought training can help us correctly evaluate practical work, profoundly understand and summarize practical work. Of course, lack of knowledge—this is not a fundamentally incurable thing. Knowledge—can be obtained through subjective effort. If you don’t have knowledge today, you can have it tomorrow, as long as our workers feel that they do lack knowledge and are willing to work hard to study seriously. The most dangerous thing is that some of our workers are unwilling to seriously improve their ideological level and further develop themselves politically and culturally. They often think that they don't have time to read; they think that he is not a person who can speak, but a person who does things; not a theorist, but a practitioner, thus legitimizing their backwardness, and even praising this backwardness as a virtue. For this kind of person, we can say bluntly: Anyone who does not have knowledge, does not have theoretical cultivation, and is unwilling to work hard to improve and make progress cannot become a good leading cadre.

In practical work, Party cadres should always pay attention to studying the classical works of Marxism-Leninism; the works of Lenin and Stalin. The Party's resolutions are the essence and examples of summarizing the revolutionary struggle experience of the masses, and are the best blueprints for summarizing the various experiences of Party, state, and economic construction. These works and resolutions give us a clear understanding of the road we have traveled in the past, and point out the future prospects and vision for us. Mastering Marxist-Leninist theory—is to master the key that can understand the general laws of social development, that is, to master the weapon that can see the regularity from concrete facts and daily affairs. Marxist-Leninist science armed our cadres with the correct attitude and methods, can enable us to be good at solving practical problems, can enable us to do our work better; can bring us increasing success and victory.

　　必须要学会总结经验
    （克·希达列夫作叶群译）
    布尔什维克党的人生观是一致的和完整的。它任何时候都坚决反对理论与实际、言论和行动的脱节。它经常都特别注意研究和总结实际工作经验的特殊意义；都特别注意怎样以创造的精神来研究党本身及党领导下的群众在共产主义社会建设斗争过程中所积累的经验。这种对待周围事务的态度完全是从生动的、革命的布尔什维克主义中产生出来的。
    斯大林同志论到孟什维克时曾指出他们的基本错误是言行不符，是以教条主义的态度来对待马克思的学说；他们不在分析实际生活中去求得指示和方针，却在相同的事情和历史上相象的事情里去求得指示和方针。
    布尔什维克的方法与这有原则上的区别。“布尔什维克不是在历史上相同事情和相象事情里去求得指示和方针，而是由研究周围的实际情况中去求得指示和方针”（斯大林语）。布尔什维克党在其工作中“不是拿引证和成语来做根据，而是拿实际经验来做根据，拿经验来审查自己的每一个工作步骤。在自己的错误中学习和教育别人去建设新的生活”。
    这就说明了为什么斯大林同志对我们干部的最重要的要求之一就是要求他们进行实际工作时不要僵化在一个地方，不要停滞在现成的固定的形式上，而应当经常研究经验，用创造的精神来进行领导。所谓创造的领导就是依据马、列主义理论来研究实际经验，总结实际经验并善于把这些经验运用于日常工作中去。一个领导者如果不善于把日常的实际工作和他对经验的理解结合起来，他就必不可免地要落后，就会陷入对新鲜事物失去知觉的危险里去。
    党的工作者——就是政治上的领导者，他应当以深远的政治眼光来进行领导，应当善于抓住和掌握一切事件的精确数字和事物的各个方面，应当善于分清本质的和非本质的现象、主要的和次等重要的问题、一般的和个别的情况。这样才能给工作以正确的评价，才能得出正确的结论来。没有经过深刻理解就作出总结，只把做过的工作平铺直叙地数一遍，无论怎样重要对于一个政治领导者来说都是不够的。政治领导者的特点应是总结实际问题和实际任务，把它们结为一体，批判地理解所经历的道路和从中得出未来工作的经验教训，这样作对于预防错误也有极重要的意义。列宁曾经说过：“我们应经常对自己进行检讨，研究整个事件发展的来龙去脉，弄清事情的前因后果，分析了昨天的错误就可以从中学习到怎样避免今天和明天的错误”。（列宁全集第二十一卷二百一十五页）
    然而，我们还不能够说我们的一切党的组织对于总结实际经验这件事都有了应有的注意。很可惜，我们还有一些党的工作者对于这件事仍采取毫不关心的态度，他们整天沉溺在日常事务中，不使自己对本身的实际工作有想一想的机会，不能想一想生活里发生了什么新的问题？怎样理解和分析这些每天发生的问题和事实？象这样的领导者如果遇到那一个工作部门里有了缺点的时候，他必然会把争取改正这些缺点的工作引为己任，但是，他却很少很少想到是什么引起这些缺点？促成缺点产生的真正原因？和为了使这些缺点在今后工作中不再重复应采取什么办法？显而易见，这样的领导者就是所谓看不见首要问题的领导者。
    某些党的工作者当他们必须勉强作某一时期或长或短的工作报告的时候，当他们必须要提到整个的工作环境、批评工作和必须作出一定结论的时候，他们的不善于总结工作的弱点就更明显的表现出来了。这里也就暴露了我们有着一些看起来似乎是能干的领导者和良好的实行家，而实际是没有能力分析组织的实际情况，没有能力总结工作，没有能力区别一切错综复杂的问题和提出具体方案来的。这些工作者他们通常都是走最轻易、最便于取巧的、最能躲避困难的捷径；他们通常都最容易满足于那些十分之九都是由事实和例子所堆积起来的材料，而这些被举出的例子和事实绝大多数又都是偶然性的，非典型的。
    让我们举出这样的例子来说吧！今年布良斯克州别日泽城市举行了该市党的代表会议，在代表会上作了一些工作报告，别日泽市委会也在会上作了工作总结报告，这个报告似乎并没有遗漏任何问题，一切问题都说到了，然而很多代表对这一总结报告都不满意，都对它提出很多批评和指责。绝大多数的发言人都认为必需指出这个报告的缺点，如果要想综合大家对报告的意见，那么借用一个代表的话就可以很好的表现出这些意见的本质来，他说：这个报告“没有一个原则的问题没有说到，至于对党的组织所进行的工作却没有任何分析。”
    要问这些代表对于市委总结报告的指责正确与否？我们回答说：这是正确的。因为市委总结报告形式的叙述了一切问题；然而，用以说明问题的只是事实、例子和数目字，一切有关事实的材料都被形式的罗列堆积起来：如组织成员的数字多少？在那里，有多少共产党员？候补党员的转党期限？市委会讨论了那些问题？企业部门的工作怎样？等等。
    也许有人要说，总结报告如果没有这些具体材料就不免形成一般化和空泛。但是我们说总结报告无论如何不能是事实的摘要或目录。它应当是一个分析一定期间党组织的实际工作的文件，是总结党的和经济建设方面经验教训的文件，是揭发和解剖工作中错误和缺点的文件。然而上述这些恰恰是别日泽市委总结报告中所缺乏的，在市委总结工作的报告里，几乎没有进行任何分析和总结，它所举出的事实和数字，只是生硬的事实和数字而已，这些事实和数字和党组织的情况并没有任何内在联系，不能说明任何问题，也不能证明任何问题。
    为了进行总结必须善于分析、研究现象和事物的各个方面，善于把现象或事实置于适当位置，弄清它和一切事件的关系，为此就要批判的看这些事实，善于识别和弄清所举事实是为了说明什么问题的？举这个事实能够证明什么和否定什么？这个事实是偶然的、还是典型的？也就是说必须考虑到举这一事实是否能很好地的说明和体现基本倾向与基本过程。
    生活是那样丰富的，那样多样性和多方面性的，我们要给任何问题找出多少合适的积极的或消极的事实和例子来这并不是怎样困难的事。然而，如果这些例子被随便使用，随手拈来就是一个例子，同基本事物没有任何内在联系，不加任何组织和分析，那么这些事实和例子仅仅能是未经制造的、生硬的原料而已。它不仅仅不能说明任何全面的实践和经验。而且还能使我们得出错误的结论。列宁曾说过：
    “在社会现象方面来说，没有任何事情能象吹嘘个别的事实和玩弄例子那样能喧赫一时，而又那样会遇到严重破产的。堆积例子一般来说——并不是什么了不起的难事，然而这种行为并没有任何意义。事实如果放在它的整体中，置于联系中它不仅是‘顽强’的而且也是无条件能证明真理的东西。事实如果和它的整体脱离，置于联系之外，如果他是片断的，随手拈来的，被随便使用的，那么它就只能等于玩具或者是比什么都不如的坏东西。……”（列宁全集卷三十、三百零三页）为了不发生这些情形，我们必须要取典型的现象、事实、和例子，并应注意地研究和总结这些现象、事实、和例子。
    不善于在很多事实中选择能代表一定特点的、有典型意义的事实，往往是由于我们的工作人员不愿意做这重要而又精细的工作；不愿意仔细的思想和理解材料。象这样在发言中牵强的安上一些事实，堆累不需要的数字和材料的习惯，在我们这里是很盛行的。殊不知这些勉强安上的事实，和不必要的数字材料仅仅能点缀和装饰发言，却不能给发言添加任何新的内容。
    在别日泽市党的代表大会上，许多共产党员严正的批评了市委的总结报告，并指出了市委工作人员没有把总结报告看成是正确分析党的工作的文件。然而，更坏的情形是我们有些发言只顾按照刻板的老一套的公式进行，至于这个发言里须要总结出什么问题，须要提出什么问题，他是根本不管的。譬如：韦利克路斯科州党委在最近一次的州委扩大会上讨论了选举工作和怎样配备培养干部的问题，在会议上谈到了干部问题的除了州委书记的报告外还有别路斯克和欧伯契科两地区委书记的发言，他们所做的报告和发言仍然是数字和例子的目录；仍然是“谁工作得好”，或是“谁没有正确完成任务”等等一大堆干部姓名的摘录。在他们的报告里对于怎样进行该区该部门干部工作问题，怎样进行集体农庄主席的工作这些重要的干部问题没有提出任何经过深思熟虑的办法和方案。培养干部问题，虽然被作为单独的部分提出，但这一部分里主要谈到的仅仅是关于建立几座政治学校，举行了多少次讲演会和有多少学生受训等问题的数字。
    可是，在这州委扩大会上，却没有任何人对别路斯克和欧伯契科两地区委书记的这种以不严肃态度准备发言的情形进行了任何最低限度的必要的批评，也许区委书记会借口他是援引州委书记关于干部问题的报告。但我们说：就是州委书记关于干部问题的报告，同样也没有表现出任何有深刻总结及明确结论的特点来。作为一个州委书记关于干部问题的报告来说，它是很不够的，它缺乏积极的行动意义的纲领，也就是说把“我们需要怎样做？”这一实际问题给完全公式化了。譬如当他说到怎样进行集体农庄主席这些干部的工作时他就得出这样的结论—“我们必须要改变区委和区的行政机构对集体农庄主席的态度。”可是当他们论到拖拉机手、机械师、和收割机手的时候他又会再度套用这个公式了。他说——“应当改变我们对培养机师干部工作的态度。”当他们提到工业干部时，他又抽象的说“必须要改变经济和建设机关的领导者对待干部的态度”。
    这种不会分析，不善于总结的情形经常是和某些党的工作者发言中的另一种缺点相联系着的，这种缺点就是缺乏尖锐提出问题和布尔什维克批评及自我批评的精神。大家都知道，单只承认错误是不够的，进行真正有效的批评其最重要的条件不仅仅是承认错误；而且是分析那些引起错误和缺点的原因，指出改正的方法。分析和解剖错误的原因正是为了使大家懂得为什么犯了错误，从中得出经验教训，并采取一定的办法使今后工作中不再重犯这种错误。如果只把工作中的缺点，领导方面的错误简单的罗列出来，既不分析和发掘产生错误的原因，又不指出改正错误的途径，那么我们就可以判定这个部门真正布尔什维克的自我批评精神比一切部门都少。
    总结经验是政治领导的最重要的标帜，不愿意或不善于总结实际工作和积累经验——对于党的工作来说是最危险的现象。我们的各级的工作者经常都忙于千百件大小事务中。如果我们这些工作者不使自己常有想一想的机会，不经常想一想生活里发生了些什么新的问题，对具体情况和实际工作不进行理解，那么，我们就没有任何保证使得这些工作人员的实际精神不会变成狭隘的经验主义，也没有任何保证使他们的事业心不会流为只会追逐眼前利益的事务主义者。
    工作中的高度的思想性和不间断的学习精神，是总结实际工作、理解实际情况的锁钥。总结能力的薄弱通常都是和理论修养不够相关联的。思想的锻炼可以帮助我们正确的评价实际工作，深刻的理解和总结实际工作，当然，知识不够——这还不是根本不可救药的事。知识——是可以从主观努力来获得的，今天没有知识，明天就可以占有它，只要我们的工作者感觉到自己的确缺乏知识，肯以严肃的态度去努力学习。最危险的倒是我们的某些工作者不肯以严肃的态度来提高自己的思想水准和使自己在政治上、文化上进一步得到开展。他们经常认为自己没有时间读书；认为他不是会说话的人，而是做事的人；不是理论家，而是实行者，就这样为自己的落后性取得合法，甚至还把这种落后性誉为美德。对于这种人我们可以直截了当的说：凡是自己没有知识、没有理论修养而又不肯努力求提高、图进步的人就不能成为一个好的领导干部的。
    党的干部在实际工作中应当经常注意研究马、列主义的古典著作；列宁、斯大林的著作。党的决议都是总结群众革命斗争经验的精粹、范例，都是总结党、国家、和经济建设的各种经验的最好的蓝本。这些著作和决议使我们清楚地认识了过去所经历的道路，和给我们指出了未来的前途及远景。掌握了马克思、列宁主义理论——就是掌握了能通晓总的社会发展规律的锁钥，也就是掌握了从具体事实和日常事务中能看出规律性的武器。马列主义科学用正确的态度及方法武装了我们的干部，能使我们善于解决实际问题，能使我们更好地的进行工作；能给我们带来与日俱增的成功和胜利。
