    Shaking Off Dependence on Imperialism
    Gradually Reducing Fine Yarn Spinning While Massively Purchasing Domestic Cotton
    Primarily to adapt to the domestic raw material supply situation, the 387,000 spindles originally spinning yarn of 32 counts or higher will be gradually reduced to 100,000. The remainder will be converted to spinning 20 count and lower coarse yarn. In the past, nearly half of the China Textile Corporation's spindles spun yarn of 32 counts or higher, thus necessitating the large-scale purchase of foreign cotton. On the other hand, in the past few years, due to the Kuomintang reactionary government's low exchange rate policy, which destroyed domestic industrial and agricultural production, American cotton could be imported in large quantities at prices lower than domestic cotton, seriously damaging Chinese cotton production and creating the abnormal phenomenon that Shanghai's textile industry had to rely on foreign cotton for its raw material supply. In the past, the amount of foreign cotton used by Shanghai's public and private cotton textile industries accounted for more than 60 percent of the total cotton used. In the future, by converting to spinning 20 count and lower coarse yarn on the one hand, and encouraging domestic cotton production and massively purchasing domestic cotton on the other, we can break free from the imperialists' control. At the same time, the China Textile Corporation's cotton mills have approximately 3,500 dan of waste cotton and cotton waste each month, which has historically been sold to merchants at prices only one-tenth to one-twentieth of the market price of raw cotton, which is quite uneconomical. Now it has been decided to use this batch of waste cotton and cotton waste to weave military blankets to supply the needs of the army. In addition, the cotton weaving sector has also decided to reduce the production of export cloth and fancy cloth, and to weave more 12-pound fine cloth and serge, which are needed by the broad masses of the Chinese people.

    Shanghai's private cotton spinning industry has more than 1,496,000 spindles and 59 factories. They are now also cooperating with the state-owned cotton textile industry and are involved in the struggle to break free from dependence on imperialism. Currently, the average number of shifts worked by each factory is approximately four days and three nights per week, with over 1,078,900 spindles in operation, accounting for more than 70 percent of the normal possible number of spindles in operation. As mentioned earlier, private factories also relied on foreign cotton in the past. After the liberation of Shanghai, the public Shanghai General Trading Company, in order to implement the correct policy of benefiting both public and private interests and developing production, has held two emergency cotton allocations in the past three months to support the private cotton textile industry in maintaining production. On July 8, the first allocation of 20,000 dan of raw cotton was made, and contracts were signed with 21 private yarn mills, including Qinfeng, Hongzhang, Yong'an, and Shenxin, based on the principle of exchanging cotton for yarn (i.e., commissioned spinning), stipulating that 5 dan of raw cotton could be exchanged for one bale of 20-count Grade A yarn. On August 29, contracts were signed with 50 private yarn mills, including Dafeng, Tongyi, Guangqin, Hengchang, Yong'an, and Shenxin, for an emergency allocation of 30,000 dan of cotton, stipulating that 5.5 dan of raw cotton could be exchanged for one bale of 20-count Grade A yarn, with each bale of yarn able to exchange for 50 jin more raw cotton than before.

    In addition, in order to thoroughly break free from dependence on imperialism, be self-reliant, and overcome the difficulties of raw cotton, Shanghai's public and private cotton textile industries are currently preparing to establish a joint cotton purchasing office for Shanghai's public and private cotton textile industries, absorbing factories to participate voluntarily. However, during the trial period, participation will be limited to factories in Shanghai, and will be expanded to other parts of East China in the future if successful. The joint cotton purchase volume will be estimated according to the possible number of spindles in operation in Shanghai's public and private yarn mills, estimating an annual cotton demand of 3.6 million dan, averaging 300,000 dan per month. Before the new cotton season arrives this year, it is planned to purchase 150,000 dan, requiring approximately 20 billion yuan. It is now decided to collect half of this amount, 10 billion yuan, first, with the remaining half collected at any time when needed. Within the total capital of 20 billion yuan, government trading institutions will contribute 20 percent of the shares, and the balance will be paid by the participating public and private factories in proportion to the number of spindles. The number of preparatory committee members for the joint cotton purchasing office is set at seven, with four members nominated by private factories and three members nominated by public factories and government agencies. The establishment of the joint cotton purchasing organization will have a significant impact on the production and raw cotton supply of Shanghai's public and private cotton textile industries in the future.

    The sales problem of Shanghai's cotton textile industry is easier to solve than the raw material problem. The cotton textile industry is also trying to promote the sale of yarn and cloth in a planned manner.

    It is indeed very difficult for Shanghai's public and private cotton textile industries to maintain production by reducing working hours, but people are confident that this is only a temporary phenomenon. When the rural autumn harvest boosts yarn and cloth sales and the new cotton comes on the market in November, the current difficult situation will surely improve, and the struggle of Shanghai's cotton textile industry to break free from imperialist economic influence will definitely achieve gradual victory.

    摆脱对帝国主义依赖
    一面逐步减纺细纱一面大量收购国棉
    首先是适应国内原料供应情况，把原来纺三十二支以上细纱的三十八万七千余枚纱锭，逐步减为十万枚。其余改纺二十支和二十支以下的粗纱。中纺过去几乎有半数锭子纺三十二支以上的细纱，因此不得不大量购用外棉。另一方面，过去几年中由于国民党反动政府采行摧毁国内工农业生产的低汇率政策，使美棉能以低于国棉的价格大批输入，严重地损害了中国棉花的生产，造成上海市纺业的原料供应非依赖外棉不可的畸形现象。过去一个时期上海市公私营棉纺业的外棉用量都在用棉总数的百分之六十以上。今后一方面改纺二十支及二十支以下的粗纱，另一方面奖励国内棉花生产并大量收购国棉，就可以摆脱帝国主义者的制轭。同时中纺各棉纺厂所余废棉和下脚棉每月约在三千五百担左右，历来标售给商人，价格仅及原棉市价的十分之一二，颇不合算。现在则决定利用这批废棉和下脚棉来纺织军毯，供应军队需要。此外如棉织部分也决定减少外销布、花色布的产量，多织十二磅细匹布和纱哔叽等中国人民大众所需要的货品。
    上海的私营棉纺工业，计有纱锭一百四十九万六千余枚，工厂五十九家。它们现在也和国营棉纺织业配合一致，卷入了摆脱对帝国主义依赖性的斗争。现在各厂开工班数每周平均约为四日三夜，运转纱锭有一百零七万八千九百余枚，占正常可能运转纱锭数的百分之七十以上。如前所说，私营各厂过去也是依赖外棉的。上海解放后，公营上海市贸易总公司为执行公私兼顾、发展生产的正确方针，扶助私营棉纺织业维持生产，三个月来曾经举行两次紧急配棉。七月八日首次配出原棉二万担，按照以棉易纱（即代纺）的原则，和私营勤丰、鸿章、永安、申新等二十一家纱厂签订合约，规定以原棉五市担易二十支甲级纱一件。八月二十九日又和大丰、统益、广勤、恒昌、永安、申新等五十家私营纱厂签订合约，紧急配棉三万担，并规定以原棉五市担半易二十支甲级纱一件，每件纱较上次可多换原棉五十斤。
    此外，上海公私营棉纺织业为求彻底摆脱对于帝国主义的依赖，自力更生，克服原棉困难起见，最近正在筹组上海公私营棉纺织业联合购棉处，吸收各厂自动参加。惟在试办期间，参加者暂以上海各厂为限，将来办有成效，再行扩大及于华东区其他各地。联合购棉数额将按照上海公私营各纱厂可能开工锭数，估计全年需棉三百六十万担，平均每月三十万担。在今年新花登场以前，拟收购十五万担，约需款二百亿元，现决定先收半数一百亿元，其余一半于需用时随时补收。在二百亿资金总额内，政府贸易机构入股百分之二十，余额由参加的公私营各厂按纱锭数比例认缴。联合购棉处的筹备委员名额定为七人，内私营各厂推派四人，公营工厂和政府机关推派三人。联合购棉机构的组成，对于今后上海公私营棉纺织业的生产和原棉供应将有很大作用。
    上海棉纺织业的销路问题较之原料问题容易解决些。棉纺织业界也正在设法有计划地推销纱布。
    现在上海公私营棉纺织业用减工的方法来维持生产，诚然十分艰苦，但人们深信这只是一时的现象，等到农村秋收纱布实销转旺以及十一月间新花上市，目前的困难情况必可改善，上海棉纺织业摆脱帝国主义经济影响的斗争，是一定要逐步地取得胜利的。
