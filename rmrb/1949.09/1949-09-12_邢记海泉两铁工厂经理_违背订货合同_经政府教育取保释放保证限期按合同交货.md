[Local News] The managers of the private Xingji and Haiquan Iron Factories in this city violated the contract with the North China Water Conservancy Promotion Agency to manufacture waterwheels. The managers of these two factories were handed over to the government for legal action. After education, they admitted their mistakes, were released on bail, and guaranteed to deliver the goods according to the contract within fifteen days. These two factories signed a contract with the North China Water Conservancy Promotion Agency to manufacture twenty waterwheels. After obtaining the deposit, they used it for other purposes, resulting in failure to deliver the goods on time. After repeated urging, they only delivered ten crudely made, poor-quality waterwheels to perfunctorily fulfill the contract. The managers of the two factories, Xing Baolin and Li Haiquan, were sent to court for handling. In order to educate the managers of these two factories and enable other factories to have a better understanding of the government's policies, the Municipal Industry and Commerce Bureau specially convened a machine industry manufacturers' conference in the Municipal Chamber of Commerce auditorium on the 10th (previous day). More than 190 manufacturers from the industry attended. Xiao Ming, director of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Preparatory Committee, also rushed to participate after hearing the news to explain the policies of mutual benefit for labor and capital and developing production. Chen Ji, section chief of the Industry and Commerce Bureau, Guo Jingyi, director of the Production Department of the North China Water Conservancy Promotion Agency, and Li Feilong, a judge of the Municipal People's Court, respectively explained the facts and errors of Xingji and Haiquan factories' breach of contract and bad faith, pointing out that the two factories had no sincerity in production at all, defrauded the deposit for other purposes, did not produce waterwheels, and prevented the work of the North China Water Conservancy Promotion Agency and the farmers from using waterwheels to develop production. Then, the managers of the two factories explained their own opinions. They knew that they had no reason to defend themselves and frankly admitted their mistakes. The meeting also solicited the opinions of various manufacturers on handling this incident. In order to promote their reflection and reform, the Industry and Commerce Bureau and the court decided to adopt a lenient policy and give them another opportunity to rehabilitate themselves, allowing them to be released on bail and deliver the remaining goods within fifteen days, and re-equip the bad waterwheels that have been handed over to improve the quality, strictly in accordance with the specifications specified in the contract. If the goods are not delivered by the deadline or are still crudely made, they will be severely punished and no further leniency will be granted.

　　邢记海泉两铁工厂经理
　  违背订货合同
    经政府教育取保释放保证限期按合同交货
    【本市讯】平市邢记、海泉两私营铁工厂违背给华北水利推进社承造水车合同，该两厂经理，被送政府法办，经教育后，已承认错误取保释放，并保证十五天内按合同交货。该两厂与华北水利推进社签订承造水车二十辆合同，于取得订款后，另作别用，以致逾期不能交货。经再三催促，只交了十辆粗制滥造、品质低劣的水车来搪塞。两厂经理邢宝林、李海泉即被送往法院处理。市工商局为教育该两厂经理，并使其他各厂对政府政策有进一步了解，特于前（十）日在市商会礼堂召开机器工业厂商大会，到有该业厂商一百九十余人，市总工会筹委会主任萧明闻讯亦赶来参加，讲解劳资两利、发展生产的政策。工商局陈纪科长、华北水利推进社生产部部长郭敬一和市人民法院审判员李飞龙分别说明邢记、海泉两工厂违约背信的事实经过及所犯错误，指出两厂根本毫无生产诚意，骗取订款另作别用，不生产水车，防害华北水利推进社的工作和农民使用水车发展生产。接着由该两厂经理说明自己的意见，他们自知无理可辩，坦白承认错误。会上并征求各厂商对处理此事件的意见。工商局和法院为促使其反省改过，特决定采取宽大政策，再予以自新机会，准取保开释，十五天内把缺货交齐，并重新装修已交的坏水车，使品质改进，严格符合合同中所定的规格，若到期再不交货或仍然粗制滥造，一定严惩，不再宽贷。
