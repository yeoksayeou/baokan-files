The People's Political Consultative Conference Xinjiang Delegates
Discuss the Liberation of the People of Xinjiang
Feng Zhong

[Reported by this newspaper] The Xinjiang delegates to the People's Political Consultative Conference, Saifudin, Alimujiang, and Tu Zhi, hosted a reception for reporters on the morning of the 28th. Mr. Saifudin declared: Under the victorious advance of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Xinjiang will soon become a free new Xinjiang under the leadership of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China. The goal for which the people of the entire Xinjiang have struggled and shed blood for so many years has been achieved today, and this should first of all be thanked to the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

In answering reporters' questions, Saifudin detailed the national liberation movement in Xinjiang. He said that for many years, the people of Xinjiang had been living in a long-term armed and unarmed struggle against oppression. There were two periods when they suffered the most severe oppression: the first was the late Qing Dynasty under the oppression of the autocratic government, and the second was the bloody rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries. The people rose up in resistance and launched armed struggles. Between 1932 and 1933, people in various parts of Xinjiang Province launched armed riots against the then rulers. In November 1944, riots broke out in the three cities of Yili, Tacheng, and Ashan. The first national liberation movement in 1932 forced Sheng Shicai, the ruler of Xinjiang Province at the time, to take disguised progressive measures. After 1940, Sheng Shicai and Wu Zhongxin were both experts in suppressing the people. Therefore, the heavy burden of oppression, exploitation, autocracy, and darkness made the revolutionary sentiment of the people of Xinjiang against them rise day by day. By 1949, a revolutionary riot broke out in Yili, which soon expanded to Tacheng and Ashan, liberating these three districts and receiving enthusiastic support from the people of the whole province. The Kuomintang reactionaries clearly saw that they could not defeat the revolutionary forces of the people of Xinjiang, so they put forward the idea of a peaceful resolution. The people were willing to have peace, so they started peaceful negotiations with the Kuomintang reactionaries, and as a result, a peace agreement was signed, and a coalition government was established in 1946. However, the Kuomintang reactionaries have always been hypocritical in deceiving the people, so the peace agreement was no exception, and the provincial government remained a reactionary government. Seeing that there was no hope of fulfilling the terms, the representatives of the people of Xinjiang withdrew from Dihua to Yili in August and September 1947, effectively severing relations with the reactionary government and continuing to carry out the struggle against the Kuomintang reactionaries in a peaceful manner, while carrying out cultural and educational work for the people of the three districts (Yili, Tacheng, and Ashan). Due to the successive victories of the People's Liberation Army, the Kuomintang reactionaries had to transfer the most reactionary lackey of the Xinjiang Province puppet chairman, Mesut, in January this year and replace him with Bao Erhan as chairman in order to win over the hearts of the people of Xinjiang. However, the people of the entire Xinjiang, after a long period of armed and peaceful struggle, have clearly understood that the liberation of the people of Xinjiang must be resolved at the same time as the liberation of the whole country, so they have always supported and looked forward to the victorious liberation of the whole country.

Saifudin continued to talk about his feelings since coming to Beijing to participate in the CPPCC, which can be summarized into three points: (1) The opening of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference shows that the goal that the people of Xinjiang have always demanded has been achieved, and all measures to achieve the goals of the people of Xinjiang have been formulated at the conference, which further shows that the future of the people of the entire China is infinitely bright. (2) The conference demonstrated the unanimous and enthusiastic unity of the representatives of the people from all over the country. (3) Although there are still major tasks ahead in the process of nation-building, the current great victory has strengthened the confidence in completing the tasks.

At the reception, Saifudin answered the questions raised by the reporters one by one:

Finally, Saifudin said: Under the principle of New Democracy and under the leadership of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, to build a new Xinjiang, this is our new task. The realization of this task is only a matter of time. The people of the entire Xinjiang guarantee that under the leadership of the Central People's Government and the wise leader Chairman Mao, we will definitely complete the major task of building a new Xinjiang.

　　人民政协新疆代表
  　谈新疆人民的解放
    冯仲
    【本报讯】参加人民政协的新疆代表赛福鼎、阿里木江、涂治于二十八日上午招待记者。赛福鼎先生宣称：在中国人民解放军胜利进军下，新疆即将在中华人民共和国中央人民政府领导下，变成一个自由的新新疆。全新疆的人民多少年来流血斗争的目的今天达到了，这首先应该感谢中国共产党和中国人民解放军。
    赛福鼎答记者问时，详述了新疆的民族解放运动。他说，新疆人民许多年来一直生活在长期武装和非武装的反压迫斗争中，受压迫最严重的有两个时期，第一个时期是清末受专制政府的压迫，第二个时期是国民党反动派的血腥统治。人民群起反抗，掀起了武装斗争，一九三二年和一九三三年间，新省各地人民曾掀起了武装暴动，反对当时的统治者。一九四四年十一月又爆发了伊犁、塔城、阿山三城的暴动。一九三二年第一次民族解放运动逼迫着新省统治者盛世才不得不采取伪装进步的措置。一九四○年以后，盛世才、吴忠信都是反人民的能手，因此，压迫、剥削、专制、黑暗的统治重负，使新省人民反对他们的革命情绪一天天的高涨。到一九四九年，伊犁爆发了革命暴动，旋即扩大到塔城和阿山，将这三个区解放，得到全省人民的热烈拥护。国民党反动派明显的看到不能打败新省人民的革命力量，乃提出了和平解决的意见；人民是愿意和平的，于是和国民党反动派开始和平谈判，结果签定了和平条款，在一九四六年成立了联合政府。但，国民党反动派是一贯以虚伪欺骗人民的，所以和平条款也不例外，而省政府则仍成为一个反动政府。新疆人民代表看到没有希望再履行条款，在一九四七年八、九月间乃由迪化撤退到伊犁，在实际上与反动政府断绝关系，一直继续着以和平方式作反对国民党反动派的斗争，对三区（伊犁、塔城、阿山）人民作文化教育工作。由于人民解放军的节节胜利，国民党反动派为了骗取新疆民心，不得不在今年一月将新省伪主席最反动的奴才麦斯武德调走，换上鲍尔汉任主席。但全新疆人民经过了长期的武装与和平的斗争，已清楚的了解了新疆人民的解放，一定要和全国人民解放同时解决，所以一直的拥护和期待着全国的胜利解放。
    赛福鼎继续谈到到北京参加政协以来的感想，总结起来可分为三点：（一）中国人民政治协商会议开幕，表示了新疆人民一向所要求的目的已经达到，并且在会议上已制定了达到新疆人民目的的一切措施，更表示了全中国人民前途无限光明。（二）在会议上表现了全国人民代表一致热烈团结的情绪。（三）在建国过程中虽尚有重大任务在面前，但目前伟大的胜利已坚定了完成任务的信心。
    在招待会上，赛福鼎逐一的答复各记者所提出的问题：
    最后赛福鼎说：在新民主主义原则下，在中华人民共和国中央人民政府领导下，来建设新的新疆，这是我们新的任务，这个任务的实现只是时间问题，全新疆人民保证在中央人民政府和英明领袖毛主席的领导下一定完成建设新新疆的重大任务。
