Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 11th: The Second World Youth Congress in Budapest passed a resolution on the Executive Committee report of the World Federation of Democratic Youth (WFDY) on the 8th, stating that the Congress unanimously agrees with the activities of the WFDY and its leading bodies in uniting youth to fight for peace, democracy, national independence, and a bright future for youth. The four years since the establishment of the WFDY have proven that the ideals, goals, tasks, and actual activities of the WFDY are completely just and fully in line with the vital interests of young people. In the four years since its establishment, the WFDY has doubled its membership and now unites over sixty million young men and women in more than seventy countries. The Youth and Student Friendship Gathering held in Budapest on the eve of the Congress further demonstrated the WFDY's growing influence.

The World Youth Congress, on behalf of sixty million young men and women, endorses the decisions of the World Peace Congress and urges all youth organizations to actively participate in implementing these decisions, to actively participate in the establishment of peace committees, and to work within them. The Congress urges all democratic youth to actively participate in the celebration of the International Day of Struggle for Peace on October 2nd.

The Congress, representing millions of young men and women, resolutely declares that democratic youth are determined to continue the struggle for lasting peace in the world, for friendship among all nations, for opposition to all manifestations of aggression, and against the threat of new war.

The resolution then points out with great satisfaction the powerful progress of the national liberation movements in colonial and dependent countries, especially the great victory of the Chinese people. The resolution states: The Congress salutes the heroic Chinese youth who are selflessly fighting for freedom and independence. The Congress calls on all youth organizations, all young men and women, to do their utmost to support the democratic youth of India, Vietnam, Burma, Malaya, Indonesia, and other colonial and dependent countries who are fighting for peace and national independence.

The Congress expresses its profound solidarity with the youth of Republican Spain and democratic Greece, and calls on youth organizations to support the struggle for freedom and independence in Spain and Greece in various ways.

The World Youth Congress firmly protests against this despicable imperialist policy of persecuting progressive movements and trampling on the rights of youth.

The Congress calls on the WFDY, national youth organizations, and democratic youth worldwide to fight against unemployment, to strive for labor protection, equal pay for equal work, to prohibit child labor, and to provide youth with opportunities to obtain general and vocational education.

The Congress declares its full support for the struggle of young working people in France, Italy, England, and other Marshall Plan countries to oppose attacks on their living standards and to fight for their rights.

In order to more effectively carry out the struggle for the economic and political rights of youth, the Congress recommends that the leading bodies of the WFDY and youth organizations consolidate their cooperation with the World Federation of Trade Unions and national youth organizations. The Congress calls on the WFDY to continue to expose the enemies who are trying to divide youth solidarity.

The resolution stipulates that the monthly magazine "World Youth" be published in four languages.

The Congress resolution concludes: Democratic youth hold unwavering confidence in the bright future of tomorrow. In order to achieve victory, we must contribute all our strength to the struggle for peace and friendship among nations. Youth unite! Forward, for lasting peace and democracy, for the national independence of all peoples, for a bright future!
