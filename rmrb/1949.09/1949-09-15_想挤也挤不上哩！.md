　　"Even if we wanted to squeeze, we couldn't!"
　　On August 28th, the newspaper office of the Fifth Corps of our Second Field Army arrived in Nanchang, and on the 30th at dusk, we arrived in Cihua Town. All along the four hundred li, the comrades of the Fourth Field Army prepared everything perfectly for us, treating us like true brothers. The following is a story from a young bugler, enough to demonstrate this revolutionary brotherly affection.
　　As soon as we arrived in Cihua, the regimental headquarters there said to us: "The houses here are very crowded. If you want to live in a particular house, we will vacate it for you. You've worked hard, don't be shy." We were sitting under a shed waiting for the regimental headquarters of the Fourth Field Army to vacate a house for us (we felt very embarrassed to have people vacate a house for us to live in as soon as we arrived). At this time, a young bugler comrade came over and, seeing that we were carrying machines, spoke a few words and learned that we were waiting for a house. He immediately pulled Minister Kang and asked him to look at the big house where the artillery company's first platoon lived. Minister Kang said, "You live very crowded, and it's troublesome for you to move." The young bugler comrade said with a Northeastern accent, "What's there to be afraid of? If you don't have a big house, you can't put the machines down, how will that work? Crowded? Isn't this just this once? Later you'll go to the Great Southwest, and we'll go to Guangdong. Even if we wanted to squeeze, we couldn't!" (Sheng)

　　“想挤也挤不上哩！”
    我们二野第五兵团连队生活报社，八月二十八日到了南昌，三十日黄昏抵达慈化镇。沿途四百里什么事都是四野同志们替我们准备得好好的，真是兄弟般的相待。下面记的是一段小司号员的话，足够来表明这种革命的兄弟之情。
    我们一到慈化，住在那里的团部就向我们提出说：“此地房子很挤，你们要住那座房子我们誊那座，你们辛苦了，不要客气。”我们在一个棚下坐着等四野的团部给我们誊房子（我们觉得一来就让人家誊出房子让我们住，很不好意思）。这时候对面走来一个司号员小同志，看到我们带得尽是机器，说了几句话知道我们在等房子，马上就拉着康部长要他去看他们炮兵连一排住的大房子。康部长说：“你们住得很挤，你们搬家怪麻烦的。”小司号员同志打着东北腔说：“那怕什么的？你们没大房按不下机器那怎么成呢，挤，才不是这一次吗？回头你们上大西南，我们上广东，想挤也挤不上哩。”  （生）
