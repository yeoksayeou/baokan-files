　  Over One Thousand Participate in Educational Work
    [Report from this Newspaper] Over two thousand two hundred students from the Second Division of North China University held a graduation ceremony for their political studies on the evening of the 11th at the main campus on Cotton Hutong. He Ganzhi, the head of the division, first pointed out that after this graduation, more than 1,100 people would leave the school to engage in educational work, more than 800 would remain at the school to continue their studies, and more than 200 would transfer to other schools or take on other work. In his speech, Principal Wu Yuzhang expressed his hope that everyone would not only wash away their bad habits but also take on the task of transforming the entire society. Subsequently, Vice-Principals Fan Wenlan and Cheng Fangwu, Dean of Studies Nie Zhen, and Deputy Secretary of the School Youth League Committee Zhu Ziqi spoke about the political and ideological nature of education, the mass line, and ideological self-struggle as parting words; and encouraged everyone to be excellent revolutionary cadres and exemplary people's teachers. Finally, a representative of the Student Union delivered a speech. At the meeting, all graduating students presented flags to the alma mater and the Second Division to pay their respects.
