Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 20th: London dispatch: Under the increasing pressure of American monopoly capital, the British government has suddenly announced a one-third devaluation of the pound sterling. The British Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sir Stafford Cripps, in a national broadcast on the evening of the 18th, officially announced that the pound sterling would be devalued from $4.03 per pound to $2.80 per pound. As the London Times had stated in advance, the devaluation news "came like a thief in the night." This is the result of a long period of behind-the-scenes negotiations between Bevin, Cripps, and the US government, kept secret from the British people. However, Cripps and other British officials repeatedly and emphatically guaranteed that the pound would not be devalued until the eve of the announcement. In this speech, Cripps had to admit that the decision had been made before he went to Washington to attend the US-UK-Canada financial conference. In his long speech, Cripps tried his best to prove the necessity of the pound's devaluation, saying: "The step I am announcing is the most serious step that the government could take, and without doing so, our current pound sterling difficulties cannot be resolved." He emphasized that Britain's current dollar and gold reserves would be exhausted and that it must rely on the devaluation of the pound to stimulate exports in exchange for dollars. However, he could not but face the serious consequences of the pound's devaluation within Britain. He did not hide the attack on the living standards of the British working class. He announced that the price of flour and bread would increase within two weeks, but at the same time announced that wages, salaries, and any personal income could not be increased. He said: "This is an iron fact, we must avoid anything that would cause an increase in production costs." In this way, overnight, British workers' wages suffered a sharp cut. London's financial circles accepted the decision to devalue the pound with suspicion and anxiety. According to a United Press London dispatch, financial figures unanimously believe that although devaluation can temporarily stimulate exports, even a one-third increase in exports will only earn back the same amount of dollars as before. It is very difficult for Britain to further increase exports to the dollar area, because the devaluation of the pound will inevitably lead to corresponding devaluations in other European capitalist countries, especially since Britain is a large importer of food and raw materials from abroad, and devaluation will inevitably increase Britain's costs and offset any expansion of the British goods market due to devaluation. The devaluation of the pound only provides favorable conditions for American investment in the sterling area and the purchase of raw materials from the sterling area. Now every dollar in the sterling area is used with a value one-third greater than in the past.

　　英政府在美帝压力下
  　进攻劳动人民宣布英镑贬值
    【新华社北平二十日电】伦敦讯：在美国垄断资本日益加紧的压力之下，英国政府已突然宣布英镑贬值三分之一。英国财政大臣克里浦斯于十八日晚间向全国广播时，正式宣布英镑自每镑合四点零三美元贬值至每镑合二点八零美元。贬值的消息如伦敦星期泰晤士报事先所称，是“象夜间的贼一样到来”的。这是贝文克里浦斯与美国政府瞒着英国人民进行长期幕后商谈的结果，但克里浦斯与其他英国官方人物，却直到宣布贬值的前夕，都一再信誓旦旦地担保英镑决不贬值。而在这次演说中，克里浦斯却不得不承认，早在他赴华盛顿出席美英加三国金融会议之前，即已作出了决定。克里浦斯在其长篇演说中竭力企图证明英镑贬值的必要，他说：“我所宣布的步骤是政府所可能采取的最严重的步骤，要不这样做，我们目前的英镑困难便无法解决。”他强调英国目前的美元黄金准备就会枯竭，必须赖英镑贬值来刺激出口，以换取美元。但是，他却不能不面对英镑贬值在英国国内引起的严重后果。他毫不隐讳对英国工人阶级生活水平的进攻。他宣布面粉与面包的价格将在两周内增加，但同时又宣布不能增加工资、薪金与任何个人收入。他说：“这是铁一般的事实，我们必须避免任何会引起生产成本的增加。”这样，就在一夜之间，英国工人的工资就受了猛烈的削减。伦敦金融界以怀疑与忧虑来接受英镑贬值的决定。据合众社伦敦讯，金融界人士一致认为：贬值虽然可以一时刺激出口，但是即使增加三分之一的出口，也不过赚回与以前相同的美元。而英国要再增加对美元区的出口，却有很大困难，因为英镑贬值也必然将引起其他欧洲资本主义国家相应的贬值，特别因为英国是食粮原料都要靠外国进口的大入超国家，贬值势必将使英国的成本增加而抵消任何由于贬值而扩大了的英国货的市场。英镑贬值只是为美国对英镑区的投资与购买英镑区原料，提供了良好的条件，现在每一块美元在英镑区，都以比过去大三分之一的价值来使用了。
