Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 28th: Dihua Radio Station broadcasted that the First Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference has been convened in Beijing, and an independent and free democratic republic is born. In order to adapt to the new situation, Deputy Commander Tao Zhiyue issued a public announcement on the 25th, declaring that from this day forward, he would sever relations with the Guangzhou government, obey the leadership of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, accept Chairman Mao's peace terms, await reorganization, and change the Xinjiang Provincial Government to the Xinjiang Provincial Provisional People's Government.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 28th: Former Kuomintang Xinjiang authorities, General Tao Zhiyue and others, issued a public announcement on the 25th, declaring their secession from the Guangzhou puppet government and joining the people's camp. The telegram stated:

To Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, Deputy Commander Peng, the People's Revolutionary Military Commission, and please forward to the commanders, deputy commanders, political commissars of the People's Liberation Army's field armies, and the representatives of the First Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference:

Our troops stationed in Xinjiang have, for the past three or four years, adhered to the leadership of General Zhang Zhizhong, supporting the policies of internal peace and external amity with the Soviet Union. Since General Zhang left the Northwest, the situation in the interior has changed. General Zhang has repeatedly expressed his concern, instructing us with revolutionary righteousness and urging all officers and soldiers to quickly join the people's democratic camp, so as to contribute to the country. Zhiyue and others, belonging to the military, have long disregarded personal praise or blame if it benefits the country and the people. Now that the First Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference has been convened, and the People's Republic of China, which the people of the whole country eagerly await, is about to be born, New China has entered the bright path of peaceful construction. Xinjiang, as a province of China, and the new troops, as the national forces guarding the frontier, will naturally express their ardent expectations for the future of national independence, freedom, prosperity, and strength. We deeply wish to make our due efforts in the complete completion of the people's revolutionary cause. Zhiyue and others respectfully lead all officers and soldiers to solemnly announce: From this day forward, we sever relations with the Guangzhou government and wholeheartedly accept Chairman Mao's Eight Peace Statements and the domestic peace agreement. All troops will remain stationed in their original defense areas, maintain local order, and await the orders of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission and the headquarters of the People's Liberation Army. We respectfully submit this telegram and await instructions. Xinjiang Provincial Garrison Commander Tao Zhiyue, Deputy Commander and Commander of the Reorganized 42nd Division Zhao Xiguang, Commander of the Reorganized 1st Cavalry Division Han Youyi, Commander of the Reorganized 78th Division Mo Chengruo, Brigade Commanders Zhong Zuyin, Li Zutang, Tian Zimei, Han Rongfu, Guo Quanliang, Zhu Minggang, Luo Ruzheng, Liu Lunyu, Yang Tingying, and Ma Pinglin kowtow in unison.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 28th: Xinjiang Provincial Government Chairman Bao Erhan, members Liu Mengchun, Qu Wu and others issued a public announcement on the 26th, seceding from the Guangzhou puppet government and joining the people's camp. The telegram stated:

To Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, Deputy Commander Peng, the People's Revolutionary Military Commission, and the First Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference: Since July 1, 1946, when a democratic coalition provincial government of representatives of all ethnic groups was organized in Xinjiang based on peaceful terms, it has consistently, under the leadership of General Zhang Zhizhong, promoted the policies of peaceful unification, democracy, and unity that are unanimously supported by the people of the province. For more than three years, due to the influence of the domestic political situation, especially the obstruction of the Kuomintang reactionaries, the task could not be fully accomplished, but thanks to the support of the people of all ethnic groups in the province and the encouragement of great friendly countries, the new province was finally able to maintain a peaceful and stable situation. Even when General Zhang Zhizhong left the Northwest for the national peace movement, and the domestic reactionary forces continued to stubbornly struggle, this province still made its greatest efforts to maintain peace and strive for peace. We deeply understand that the only wish of the people of Xinjiang is to complete the construction of a rich, strong, healthy, and happy New Xinjiang with the support of a unified, independent, free, and democratic motherland, and further contribute its strength to the national peaceful construction. Now that the First Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference has been convened, the birth of a unified, independent, free, and democratic New Democratic People's Republic of China is imminent. The people of the whole country are rejoicing for the foundation of this historically great project. The people of the entire province of Xinjiang feel especially excited about the birth of New China. We now solemnly announce on behalf of the Xinjiang Provincial Government and the people of all ethnic groups in the province: From this day forward, we sever relations with the reactionary government in Guangzhou, wholeheartedly accept Chairman Mao's Eight Peace Statements and the domestic peace agreement, and reorganize the provincial government into the Xinjiang Provincial Provisional People's Government, temporarily maintaining the province's administrative affairs, and awaiting orders from the Central People's Government. At the same time, we invite the provincial committee members remaining in Yining to return to Dihua for joint cooperation. We firmly believe that under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the great leader Chairman Mao, this province will surely quickly embark on a bright and splendid path of peaceful construction. We respectfully submit this telegram and await instructions. Xinjiang Provincial Government Chairman Bao Erhan, members Liu Mengchun, Qu Wu, Liu Xiaoli, Chen Fangbo, Liu Yongxiang, Bai Wenyu, Liu De'en, Erdeni, and Zhong Dihua kowtow in unison.
