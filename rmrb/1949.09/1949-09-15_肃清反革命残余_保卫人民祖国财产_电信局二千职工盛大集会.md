　　Thoroughly Eliminate Counter-Revolutionary Remnants
  　Defend the People's Motherland's Property
  　Telecommunications Bureau Holds Grand Meeting of Two Thousand Employees
    [Our Newspaper] In order to thoroughly eliminate counter-revolutionary remnant forces, the General Telecommunications Bureau and the Beiping Telecommunications Bureau held a staff meeting of more than two thousand people at the General Telecommunications Bureau at 9:00 a.m. yesterday (the 14th). First, the registration group announced the list of sixty-nine registered reactionary party members, league members, and secret agents. Then representatives from the Beiping Municipal People's Government and Deputy Director Liu Yin of the General Bureau spoke. The main points of Deputy Director Liu's speech were: (1) The whole country is about to be liberated, but everyone should pay attention to overcoming complacency and be vigilant against sabotage by special agents, be responsible to the people, and be responsible to the country. (2) There are still some weak elements and "nice guys" among the employees who do not believe in class struggle. In addition, some employees only want to exploit public resources and sell public property for personal gain. This is the basis for the activities of counter-revolutionary elements. Therefore, everyone must be vigilant, firmly stand on the class stand, and everyone should rise up to monitor reactionary elements. This is the key to workers' welfare. (3) We must not only concentrate our efforts to fight against counter-revolutionary elements, but also establish and strengthen work systems, improve work styles, and combine construction work with protecting the property of the people's motherland. It is not enough to only passively protect without actively building. He called on all employees to make it everyone's responsibility to report reactionary elements after this meeting and jointly protect the property of the people's motherland. He also pointed out that reactionary elements only have two futures: one is to bow their heads to the people, repent, and denounce other reactionary elements; the other is to continue to do evil, in which case they will be severely punished. For example, Nie Chuanru, the former director of the Beiping Telecommunications Bureau, has been arrested by the Public Security Bureau for consistently refusing to register.
    Finally, the workers' union announced: From the 16th to the 20th, each trade union group will specifically discuss today's report and how to fight against hidden enemies in the telecommunications business sector in order to protect the property of the motherland. The union's lead-printed newspaper "Telecommunications Workers" will also rush to print a supplement, publishing the discussion outline prepared by the union and relevant reference materials such as the Xinhua News Agency short commentary to help everyone study.

　　肃清反革命残余
  　保卫人民祖国财产
  　电信局二千职工盛大集会
    【本报讯】电信总局及北平电信局为了肃清反革命残余势力，昨（十四）日上午九时在电信总局召开两千多人的职工大会。首先由登记组公布已登记之六十九名反动党团人员及特务名单，继由北平市人民政府代表及总局刘寅副局长讲话。刘副局长的讲话要点为：（一）现在全国快解放了，但大家应注意克服太平观念。警惕特务破坏，对人民负责、对国家负责。（二）职工中还有部分软弱分子、老好人，不相信阶级斗争，另有些员工光想揩公家的油，套卖公家东西，这就是反革命分子活动的基础。因之每个人都要警惕，要坚定阶级立场，大家起来监视反动分子，这是工人福利的关键问题。（三）不仅要集中力量向反革命分子进行斗争，还要建立与加强工作制度，改进工作作风，把建设工作与保护人民祖国的财产结合起来。只是消极保护，不积极建设还不行。他号召全体职工从这个会后，把检举反动分子当成每一个人的责任，共同来保护人民祖国的财产。并指出反动分子只有两个前途：一个是向人民低头，悔过自新，检举别的反动分子；一个是继续为非作歹，那就要受到严厉的惩罚。如伪北平电信局局长聂传儒，始终拒抗登记，已被公安局逮捕。
    最后，职工会宣布：各工会小组从十六号至二十号专门讨论今天的报告及电信企业部门中如何与隐蔽敌人斗争，以保护祖国财产的问题。工会铅印报“电信职工”并赶印出增刊，登载工会所拟的讨论提纲及新华社短评等有关参考材料，帮助大家学习。  　　　　　　　　　（肖力）
