[Comprehensive report from our correspondents] Various agencies, organizations, and troops in Beijing are actively practicing thrift to aid disaster relief. Factories and schools in Beijing have also joined the wave of enthusiasm for disaster relief. The Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions' entire staff have been brainstorming and discussing this, and the third group of the Municipal Federation's Youth League branch took the lead in responding, implementing thrift measures starting from the 16th, and launching a "one or two liang of rice" movement. The trade union of the Liulihe Railway Station and the first branch of the Beijing Machinery General Factory successively convened worker meetings. Some workers said: "Workers and peasants are one family. If the peasants are in trouble, we should help them and share the same boat." All employees of the Liulihe Railway Station voluntarily signed up to donate over 36,000 yuan in one hour. More than 300 workers from the Machinery Factory donated more than 1,200 jin of rice. All the employees of the Beijing Clothing Factory Consumer Cooperative eagerly signed up, with workers from the general cooperative and the grain department alone donating a total of over 240 jin of millet. Other privately-owned factories such as Zhenhua Printing Factory, Shuanghesheng Brewery, and Danhua Match Company also made generous donations. Together, they donated nearly 10,000 jin of rice. The People's Printing Factory donated over 480,000 yuan in Renminbi. Comrades from the Beijing Municipal People's Government Land Administration Bureau and Labor Bureau felt that one liang of rice per day was too little and voluntarily proposed saving two to five liang per day. The two bureaus plan to save more than 6,000 jin of millet from September to February of next year. The Second District Public Office, the Fourth District Committee, the District Public Office, the First Branch of the Public Security Bureau, the Fifth Branch of the Internal Affairs Bureau, and the Municipal Third Hospital all generously donated. The employees of the Third Hospital alone donated over 4,400 jin of millet, over 440,000 yuan in Renminbi, and dozens of pieces of clothing and other items. The hospital authorities also donated all of their one-day diagnostic income of over 395,000 yuan. A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Beijing said: "Without the support of the people for more than ten years, we could not have achieved today's victory. Their disaster is our disaster." The two detachments of the unit donated over 9,500 jin of surplus millet, and together with the daily one-liang savings, they will donate tens of thousands of jin of rice, as well as a large number of towels, shoes, and socks.

　　The thrift and disaster relief movement in Beijing's schools is now being widely carried out. The Peking University School Affairs Committee made a special decision and jointly discussed disaster relief measures with various groups in the school. The Student Union organized discussions in various departments to respond to the one- or two-liang rice movement, and collected information on disasters across the country to compile wall newspapers. Teachers, staff, students and workers of the National Beijing Mongolian-Tibetan School signed up to donate money and goods for disaster relief. Teachers proposed to donate 70 to 80 jin of rice per month. After discussion, students in each class all felt that one or two liang of rice was too little and decided to save two liang per person per day. The Beijing Normal University Student Union held a class representative meeting on the 27th to discuss launching the one- or two-liang rice movement. Some proposed six months, some said three months, and some enthusiastically said it would continue until the disaster was over. In the end, it was decided to deduct two jin of rice per person per month from the meals. During the disaster relief discussion at the Second Affiliated Elementary School of Beijing Normal University, some teachers said: "When eating rice, don't forget the rice growers. The peasants are suffering today, and we should help them." All teachers, staff and workers of the school donated a large amount of millet. Elementary school students in Donggaofang National School in the Sixth District initiated a 20 yuan per person donation movement. The Beijing Municipal Primary and Secondary School Teachers' Union recently sent letters to various schools, calling on them to respond to the one- or two-liang rice movement and proposing to strengthen disaster relief propaganda and concretely organize donations. Currently, various primary and secondary schools have responded. Teachers and staff of Municipal Fifth Middle School, Beijing Normal School, Chengdu Normal School, and Beijing Normal University Affiliated Boys' Middle School have enthusiastically donated. Many people said: "One or two liang of rice is too little. Compared to the combatants of the People's Liberation Army and the cadres on the supply system, we who receive salaries should donate more!" In general, attention was paid to grasping the correct guidelines during the donation process, taking into account individual circumstances. Some families with heavier burdens who donated more were politely refused their enthusiastic donations.

　　During this thrift and disaster relief movement, many units paid attention to propaganda and education work, making everyone aware of the significance of this disaster relief, which is fundamentally different from the "pity" and "almsgiving" of the bourgeoisie in the past. Through donations and disaster relief, they further clarified their understanding that the people of the liberated areas are one, and greatly promoted the spirit of mutual assistance and friendship among the people.

　　京各机关团体工厂学校
  　热烈捐助灾胞
    【本报综合通讯员报导】北京市各机关团体部队纷纷节约救灾。各工厂、学校也相继卷入了救灾热潮。北京市总工会全体干部分头酝酿讨论，市总青年团支部第三小组首先响应，自十六日起施行节约，开展一两米运动。琉璃河车站职工会、北京机械总厂第一分厂，先后召开职工大会，有些工人说：“工人农民是一家，农民有患难我们应帮助，同舟共济。”琉璃河车站全体职工在一个钟头内，自动报名捐款三万六千余元；机械厂三百余人捐米一千二百余斤。北京被服厂消费合作总社全体职工，争先恐后报名，仅总社和粮食部工友，即共捐助小米二百四十余斤。其他私营振华印刷厂、双合盛啤酒厂、丹华火柴公司等，都纷纷捐输，以上共捐米近万斤。人民印刷厂捐献人民币达四十八万余元。北京市人民政府地政局、劳动局同志们则认为每日一两米太少，自动提出每天节约二两至五两。该两局计划自九月至明年二月止，共可节约小米六千余斤。二区区公所、四区区委会、区公所、公安局外一分局、内五分局、市立第三医院，纷纷解囊捐献。第三医院职工即捐出小米四千四百余斤，人民券四十四万余元，另有衣物等数十件。医院当局并将一日诊疗所得三十九万五千余元全部捐输。解放军驻京某部都说：“没有老百姓十多年来的支援，我们就不可能取得今天的胜利，他们的灾难就是我们的灾难。”该部两个支队共献出节余小米九千五百余斤，连同每日一两米的节约，共计可捐米数万斤，还有大批毛巾、鞋袜等。
    京市各学校的节约救灾运动现正广泛开展。北大校务委员会特作出决定，并联合全校各团体商讨救灾办法。学生会组织各系级展开讨论，响应一两米运动，并搜集各地灾荒情况，编刊壁报。国立北京蒙藏学校教职员、学生、工友，纷纷签名捐款救灾，教员提出每月捐米的有七十斤、八十斤不等。各班学生经过讨论后，大家都说一两米太少，决定每天每人节约二两。师大学生会二十七日召开班代表会议，讨论开展一两米运动。有的提半年，有的说三个月，有的则热情地说救到灾过为止。最后决定由伙食中每人每月扣除二斤米。师大二附小在讨论救灾中，有的教员提出：“吃米不忘种谷人，农民今天遭灾难，我们应当帮助。”全校教职员工友捐助了大批小米。六区东高房国民学校小学生发起每人捐二十元运动。京市中小学教联日前亦向各校发出信件，号召响应一两米运动，并提出加强救灾宣传、具体组织捐献款项等工作。现各中小学纷纷响应，市立五中、北京师范、成达师范、师大男附中等校教职员都热烈捐输，不少人说：“一两米太少，比起解放军的战斗员和供给制的干部，我们拿薪金的，应该多拿点！”捐献中一般都注意掌握正确方针，顾及个人实际情况，有些家庭负担较重而捐得较多的他们的热心捐助都被婉言谢绝了。
    这次节约救灾运动中，不少单位都注意了宣传教育工作，使大家认识了这次救灾的意义，与过去资产阶级假慈悲的“怜悯”、“施舍”根本不同；经过捐输救灾，更明确认识了解放区人民是一体，大大发扬了人民间的互助友爱精神。
