　　US Imperialism Arbitrarily and Illegally Decides to Raise Japan's Industrial Level
  　妄图发展侵略战争潜力
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 1st. A United Press Tokyo dispatch of the 27th reports: MacArthur Headquarters announced that it will use the 1932-1936 level as the basis for Japan's industrial recovery, instead of the lower 1930-1934 level stipulated by the Far Eastern Commission. This is another illegal measure by the United States to actively support Japan's war potential and make Japan a US arsenal in the Far East. To justify this measure, American economists trot out the long-bankrupt Malthusian population theory, saying that "this change is necessary due to the increase in Japan's population." But everyone knows that MacArthur's measure stems from the US policy of actively restoring and expanding Japan's war potential and turning Japan into an aggression base. From the Pauley Plan to the Strike Plan, the Draper Plan, and the Hoffman Plan, the repeated raising of Japan's industrial level and the reduction or even cancellation of Japan's reparations fully prove this point. For example, according to the recommendations of the Hoffman Mission last December, Japan's steel ingot production has been increased from the 2.25 million tons per year allowed by the Pauley recommendation to 11 million tons, and steel products from 1.5 million tons to 12 million tons. This level greatly exceeds Japan's highest wartime output. MacArthur Headquarters also argued that the 1932-1936 level it chose was because of "the development of new Japanese industries in the mid-1930s" and because "this period is more representative of normal, non-depressed business conditions." MacArthur Headquarters did not have the courage to explain what this "new industrial development" refers to. But as is well known, 1932 was the year after Japanese militarism occupied Northeast China, and 1936 was the year before Japan launched a full-scale war of aggression against China, both of which were periods of great development of Japan's military industry.

　　美帝擅自非法决定提高日本工业水平
  　妄图发展侵略战争潜力
    【新华社北平一日电】据合众社东京二十七日电，麦克阿瑟总部宣布：它将以一九三二至一九三六年的水平为日本工业恢复的基础，而不以远东委员会所规定的一九三○至一九三四年较低的水平为标准。这是美国积极扶植日本战争潜力，使日本成为美国在远东兵工厂的又一非法措施。为了给这种措施辩护，美国经济学家搬出早已破产了的马尔萨斯人口论，说什么“由于日本人口的增加，这种改变是必要的。”但尽人皆知，麦克阿瑟这一措施，是从美国积极恢复与扩展日本战争潜力，把日本变成侵略基地的政策出发的。从鲍莱计划到斯揣克计划、德莱柏计划、霍夫曼计划等一再提高日本工业水平与缩小以至取消日本的赔偿，都充分地证明了这一点。例如，依照去年十二月霍夫曼使团的建议，日本钢块产量已由鲍莱建议所允许的年产量的二百二十五万吨提高至一千一百万吨，钢材由一百五十万吨提高至一千二百万吨。这一水平大大超过了日本战时的最高产额。麦克阿瑟总部又辩解说，它所选择的一九三二至一九三六年的水平，是因为“三十年代中期日本新工业的发展”，是因为“这一段时期更能代表正常的、不萧条的企业状况”。麦克阿瑟总部没有勇气说明这种“新工业的发展”是指什么工业。但如所周知，一九三二年是日本军国主义侵占中国东北的后一年，一九三六是日本全面发动侵华战争的前一年，都正是日本军事工业大大发展的时期。
