Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 23rd: According to TASS, Budapest, related witnesses in the Hungarian People's Court trial of the Rajk treason case on the 20th testified to the actions of the traitorous criminals.

　　Witness Bokor, former Horthy police captain and relative of Rajk, testified that Rajk was hired by the police as a spy in 1931, and in 1936 Bokor helped Rajk transfer to Czechoslovakia.

　　Witness Ferencz, who served as prosecutor in the Sopronköcshida trial in January 1945, testified that during that trial, Rajk requested that Szweeney-Zeil and others be summoned to prove that he himself was employed by the police. After verification, the military court released Rajk.

　　Witness Stoll, a Horthy political police officer and American spy, was in the same Sopronköcshida prison as Rajk. Rajk asked him to go to the American-occupied zone of Germany to report to Szweeney-Zeil, the head of Hungarian special agents, that Rajk would return to Hungary. He found Szweeney-Zeil and met Claude Ville of the American intelligence agency. Claude Ville decided to hire Rajk.

　　Witness Zbenny, former secretary of the Hungarian Prime Minister's Office, was Deputy Minister of the Interior in 1947. He testified that in 1947, when Rajk presided over the investigation of anti-republican conspirators, Rajk personally released the conspirator Defense Minister Bártha.

　　Witness Tiersnis, appointed by Rajk as head of the Information Department of the Ministry of the Interior, was a British spy and also a Southern country spy. He testified about Rajk's Trotskyist activities in French concentration camps in 1937 and listed the anti-democratic elements he helped Rajk place in the Ministry of the Interior, proving Tito's trust in Rajk.

　　Witness Tariznias, a teacher in Bács County and former wife of the Southern country's former envoy to Hungary, Mrazovich, testified that Mrazovich took her to a hunting party at Klin's estate in Bács County, where she met two strangers whom Mrazovich did not introduce. One of them was identified in court as Rajk. The three of them wandered around the hunting grounds, and she overheard fragments of their conversation mentioning "must act," "Bárfé will be Minister of Defense," and mentioning the names Rakosi and Farkas. When the judge showed her a photograph of Rankovic, she immediately recognized him as the other stranger at the hunting party.

　　Witness Nimeth, a spy hired by Bárfé, was Chief of Staff of the Hungarian Border Guard in 1946. Bárfé recruited him and made him contact Brankov, reporting the border guard's military equipment, organization, and deployment at any time, placing Horthy officers and loosening the Hungarian-Southern border defense. Brankov ordered him to find weakly guarded places on the Soviet-Hungarian border in order to send spies into the Soviet Union. In 1948, Bárfé wanted him to be the Hungarian military attache to the Soviet Union, instructing him to learn about the Soviet army's situation and approach military attaches from various people's democratic countries to gather intelligence. After Nimeth arrived in Moscow, he contacted Mrazovich, who told him that Brankov's anti-Tito statement was a smokescreen.

　　Witness Férdi testified that Zohni and Vaki passed secret information to the American spy Feld in Switzerland through him. He learned from Lomb that there was close cooperation between American and Southern country intelligence agencies, and that the Southern country had a large spy network in Switzerland.

　　Witness Vandoli recounted that Justus asked her to establish Trotskyist groups and cells. Justus reported to her group, attacking people's democratic countries, slandering Hungarian government personnel, and saying that it was necessary to prepare for the struggle against the current democratic system, and that the struggle would receive help from the United States and the Southern country.

　　The last witness was Friesno (Ilona Dereki), who served as Justus's personal secretary from February 1945 to July 1948. She said that French military attaché in Hungary, Giache, often had long meetings with Justus.

　　After the court finished hearing the witnesses, it adjourned.
