To the Editor:

Will a business operating secretly without a storefront be punished for tax evasion? Does the government permit secret business operations? Can it be reported, and what are the procedures? I hope the editor can provide answers.

Liang Fu

Mr. Liang Fu:

Regarding your question about reporting secretly operated businesses, the Tax Bureau provides the following answer:

Editor

Secretly operating a business not only affects government tax revenue but also impacts the business of legitimate merchants, so the government absolutely does not allow it. Anyone can report it. Such reporting is a manifestation of being responsible to the people, and we welcome it. The procedure is very simple: report it in writing or orally to the relevant tax sub-bureau. The tax sub-bureau will then conduct an investigation and report to the municipal bureau to decide how to handle it. If the business voluntarily declares before being reported, the tax bureau will still require payment of taxes according to regulations; otherwise, it will be treated as intentional tax evasion.

　　暗中经营生意以有意逃税论
    编者同志：
    没有门面暗中经营的生意，是否以漏税罪处分？政府方面是否允许暗中经营？如检举是否可以？有何手续？请编者予以答复为盼。

    梁夫先生：
    你所问关于检举暗中经营生意的问题，承税务局解答如下：　　　
    编者
    暗中经营生意，不但影响政府税收，而且更影响正当商人的营业，所以政府是绝对不允许的。任何人都可以检举。这种检举是对人民负责的表现，我们是欢迎的。手续很简单，就是用书面或口头向各该管税务分局报告；然后税务分局进行调查了解，汇报市局决定如何处理。如未经检举而自行申报的，税局仍依规定补纳税款，否则以有意逃税论处。
