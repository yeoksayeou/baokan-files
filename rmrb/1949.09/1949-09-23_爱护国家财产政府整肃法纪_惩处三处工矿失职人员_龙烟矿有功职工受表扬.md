　　Commendation for Meritorious Employees of the Longyan Mine
　　[Reported by this newspaper] In the Mentougou Coal Mine, six accidents occurred continuously within fifteen days in June and July, including two fires in the powder magazine, one blasting cap explosion, one winch brake failure, one electric fence fire, and one discovery of blasting caps in the underground railway, resulting in a total loss of approximately 270,000 catties of millet. After investigation by the People's Government of Beiping Municipality, the main reasons were found to be the leadership's ideological paralysis, lack of thorough work, and failure to rely on the masses; failure to effectively educate, reform, unite, and use existing personnel; negligence and carelessness in custody and inventory work; and failure to pay attention to learning from fire accidents in other places, demonstrating a serious lack of responsibility towards the people's property. In order to educate cadres in enterprise departments and other departments to raise vigilance and cherish the people's property, the Beiping Municipal Government, on September 17th, submitted a request to the North China People's Government for approval to punish the following personnel: Yuan Shixian, the takeover committee member, was ideologically paralyzed, irresponsible in his work, and divorced from the masses, exhibiting serious bureaucratic work style and should be removed from his post. Zhang Shiming, the factory director, was perfunctory and shirking responsibility and should receive a major demerit. Jiang Riguang, the storage director, was careless in the inventory; Fu Xiangnan, the storekeeper, was negligent in business and lax in inspection, and irresponsible for the people's property, should all be removed from their posts and sent to the People's Court for interrogation. Li Zhizhong, the storekeeper, was perfunctory in the inventory work and should be removed from his post. Zhao Yiting, the deputy section chief of the administrative section, was paralyzed in his work and irresponsible, and although he had only been in office for a short time, he should also be strictly criticized. The North China People's Government also pointed out that it is necessary to educate all cadres of the Mentougou Coal Mine, learn from this experience and lessons, further rely on the masses, deeply understand the root causes of the incidents, earnestly improve leadership, and strengthen security work.

　　[Reported by this newspaper] The drying room of the gunpowder factory of the Longyan Iron Mine, under the North China Iron and Steel Company, caught fire on the morning of August 20th, burning 98 feet of wooden boards. The reason was that the watchman, Li Luanzi, deserted his post without authorization, and the acting deputy foreman, Ma Yupu, was consistently paralyzed and irresponsible; he neither conducted a thorough inspection before the fire nor reported it afterward. The mine decided to expel Li Luanzi and remove Ma Yupu from his position as acting deputy foreman. The leadership of the gunpowder factory should be strictly criticized for insufficient inspection and supervision. Employees Wang Wencai and others led the staff to bravely fight the fire, and their spirit of cherishing national property should be commended. The Longyan Iron Mine immediately conducted a serious review of the fire and studied ways to improve the drying room.

　　[Reported by this city] In the case of the fire in the laboratory of the Shijingshan Steel Plant in May of this year, after investigation by the Public Enterprise Department of the North China People's Government, the personnel involved have been handed over to the People's Court of Beiping Municipality by the North China People's Supervisory Procuratorate. Jin Huaizeng, the director of the laboratory, was sentenced to two years' imprisonment with a three-year reprieve; Zhao Jinji, a worker in the laboratory, was sentenced to one year's imprisonment with a two-year reprieve. The muffle furnace in the laboratory was designed by Jin Huaizeng, with three sides made of refractory bricks and one side against the wall. During construction, it was not carefully checked, and the wooden board wall was mistaken for a brick wall. On May 25th, an experiment was conducted to refine powdered ore into lump ore, requiring a temperature of over 800 degrees. The furnace had never been burned to such a high temperature in the past, but Jin Huaizeng still acted hastily and did not consider the consequences of the high temperature, and sent Zhao Jinji, a seventeen-year-old worker, to watch the fire overnight and then left, without giving detailed instructions or checking whether the worker could accomplish the task, resulting in a fire. Afterward, Jin Huaizeng blamed objective reasons and did not deeply reflect on and humbly admit his mistakes. His thoughts contained the erroneous idea that he was a technician and tried to obtain leniency from the government. The People's Court of Beiping Municipality believed that Jin Huaizeng caused huge losses to the people's property with a bad work attitude and a serious bureaucratic work style, and sentenced him to two years' imprisonment. However, after the factory was taken over, the leadership's attention to fire prevention, supervision, and inspection was insufficient, and ideological education of retained personnel was not tightly grasped. Based on the principle of education and reform, so that Jin Huaizeng can correct his mistakes in actual work, atone for his crimes, and benefit the work, a three-year reprieve was granted. Zhao Jinji was assigned to guard the night, but he left his post without permission and slept, failing to faithfully perform the assigned duties, causing losses to the people's property, so the court also sentenced him.

    龙烟矿有功职工受表扬
    【本报讯】门头沟煤矿于六、七月间十五天内，连续发生六次事件，计火药库起火两次、雷管爆炸、铰车闸失灵、电栏起火、井下铁道发现雷管各一次，共计损失约值小米二十七万余斤。经北平市人民政府令饬查究原因，主要由于领导思想上麻痹，工作不深入，不依靠群众；未能很好的教育改造，团结使用原有人员。对保管清点工作疏忽草率，又未能重视接受其他地方的失火教训，表现了对人民财产严重的不负责任的态度。平市府为了教育企业部门及其他部门干部提高警惕，爱护人民财产，于九月十七日呈请华北人民政府批准处分以下人员：接管委员袁士先，思想上麻痹，工作不负责任，脱离群众，有严重的官僚主义作风，应予撤职。厂长张世铭，遇事敷衍，推卸责任，应记大过一次。保管主任江日光，清点草率；保管员傅向南，疏忽业务，检查不严，对人民财产不负责任，均应撤职送人民法院讯办。保管员李志忠，对清点工作草率应付，应予撤职。事务股副股长赵一庭，工作上麻痹，不负责任，虽任职时间较短，亦应予以严格批评。华北人民政府并指出必需教育门头沟煤矿全体干部，吸取此次经验教训，进一步依靠群众，深入了解事件发生之根源，切实改进领导，加强保卫工作。

    【本报讯】华北钢铁公司所属龙烟铁矿火药厂烘干室，于八月二十日上午失火，烧毁木板九十八尺。原因是由于看管人李乱子，擅离职守，代理副领班马玉璞一贯麻痹，不负责任；此次失火事前既不切实检查，事后又不报告。该矿决定将李乱子除名，马玉璞撤销代理副领班职务。火药厂领导上检查督促不周，应严格批评。职工王文池等带动员工，奋勇扑救，对这种爱护国家财产的精神，给予表扬。龙烟铁矿对这次失火即时认真检讨，并研究了烘干室的改进办法。

    【本市讯】本年五月石景山炼钢厂化验室失火一案，经华北人民政府公营企业部调查清楚，有关人员已由华北人民监察院送交北平市人民法院处理，该化验室主任晋怀曾处徒刑二年，缓刑三年；该室工人赵晋基处徒刑一年，缓刑二年。该化验室的马弗炉系晋怀曾设计，三面用耐火砖，一面靠墙。于建造时未仔细检查，将木板墙误为砖墙。五月二十五日试验将粉矿炼为囤矿，需八百度以上高温。过去该炉从未烧至如此高温，而晋怀曾仍草率从事，对高温后所发生之后果未予考虑，派一十七岁的工人赵晋基看火守夜后即离开，既未详加指示，也未检查工人是否能达成任务，以致酿成火灾。事后晋怀曾归咎客观原因，不深刻反省、虚心承认错误，其思想中存在着自己是技术人员，企图得到政府宽大的错误想法。北平市人民法院认为晋怀曾以恶劣的工作态度与严重的官僚主义作风，造成巨大人民财产的损失，予以判徒刑二年。惟该厂于接管后，领导上对防火注意、督促检查均不够，对留用人员思想教育也抓得不紧。本诸教育改造的原则，使晋怀曾能在实际工作中改正错误，立功赎罪，裨益于工作，特予缓刑三年。赵晋基被派守夜，竟私自离开岗位睡觉，对于指定的职务未能忠实执行，使人民财产遭受损失，故法院亦予判刑。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（市府新闻室）
