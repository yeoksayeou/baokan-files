Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 18th. In preparation for the design of a new Beiping, the Beiping Urban Planning Committee, led by Professor Li Songchen of Peking University, Professor Liu Xinwu of Tsinghua University, and Professor Zong Guolian of Tangshan Jiaotong University, had over a hundred students from the Department of Geosciences of Tsinghua University and Jiaotong University complete a typical survey of the Beiping urban area during the summer vacation. The majority of the data has been organized and detailed charts have been created. The scope of the survey is very broad, and charts have been produced for the Eastern City residential area, the Northern City residential area, the Temple of Heaven Longxugou area, and Huashi, among others. The so-called typical survey refers to a sampling of representative areas, with the main contents being population density, occupational distribution, residents' education level, land use, traffic conditions, etc. Currently, the design and survey departments of the Beiping Urban Planning Committee both have dedicated personnel in charge, and architecture and geoscience departments from various schools have sent people to participate and assist.
