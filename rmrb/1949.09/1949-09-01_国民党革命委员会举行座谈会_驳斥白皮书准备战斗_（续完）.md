　　Chairman Mao, in his article "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship," pointed out that leaning to one side is the revolutionary truth discovered by Mr. Sun Yat-sen after forty years of experience and the CCP after twenty-eight years of experience. Today, when we look at Mr. Sun's Three Principles of the People, his letter to the Soviet Union, and his last will and testament, isn't that a thorough policy of leaning to one side? Therefore, all revolutionary followers of Mr. Sun should, with a sincere attitude, follow Chairman Mao's instructions to arm their own thinking, eliminate all thoughts that are harmful to the revolution, and resolutely lean to the side of the peace and democracy camp. There must be no wavering, no existence of middle-of-the-roaders, and even more vigilance must be raised to strictly guard against the fifth column of American imperialism disguised and sneaking in to divide the people's democratic camp. Only in this way can we smash all the conspiracies of American imperialism and consolidate the victory of the revolution!

Chen Cisheng
　　The so-called "democratic individualism" has a foundation in all countries except the Soviet Union, but its foundation varies in thickness from country to country. Its foundation is the bourgeoisie. China has a strong Communist Party, a strong People's Liberation Army, and a strong united front; at the same time, China's bureaucratic comprador bourgeoisie has fallen, and the petty bourgeoisie has deep hatred for imperialism. We will certainly make American imperialism fail miserably. Mr. Mao Zedong's fighting policy of "developing progressive forces, winning over middle-of-the-road forces, and isolating die-hard forces" is also "applicable to all parts of the world." The better the work of developing progressive forces and winning over middle-of-the-road forces is done, the more isolated the forces of imperialism become, and the easier it is to defeat them.

Yu Xinqing
　　American imperialism emphasizes its democratic methods in its consistent propaganda and hopes that other countries will also accept its democratic methods. After reading the White Paper, we know that its democracy is: 1. A democracy of arming the reactionaries of another country; 2. In China, it is a democracy of supporting a dictatorial fellow to suppress the majority of the people; 3. A democracy that violates the will of the majority of people in a country. I once told Mr. Wedemeyer sincerely about the above points of view when he came to Beiping, but of course he would not accept my opinion. Now I want to tell the Americans frankly: (1) The so-called "democratic individualism" has never succeeded in the history of world revolution, and it will never succeed in China. (2) It is foolish to dream of defeating us by force. (3) The Chinese democratic revolution based on workers and peasants will definitely succeed; otherwise, it will be an enemy of the Chinese people. At the same time, I used to be a Christian, so I want to say to Christians all over the world: 1. Imperialism's attempt to conquer the world by force is a destruction of peace and a violation of justice and truth. 2. The past blind adherence of Christianity to imperialism should be reviewed and corrected. 3. The victory of communism is the final completion of the socialism of Christian fantasy.

Li Zisong
　　This time, American imperialism issued the White Paper, frankly admitting its crimes of aggression against China, but it still concealed many important facts. For example, the signing of unequal Sino-American commercial treaties, the request to obtain naval and air bases and privileges in China as conditions for aiding the reactionary regime, and even the crimes of American soldiers killing our people and raping our women, infringing on the interests of the Chinese people, are too numerous to mention. However, the White Paper did not frankly admit these facts, but instead said that the United States has a traditional "friendship" with China! We Chinese people have been harmed by American imperialism, and each of us is a victim. We all have the right to report American imperialism's crimes of aggression and murder in China, just like reporting special agents, so that people all over the world can more clearly recognize its true face.

Qin Yuanbang
　　Marxism-Leninism is the theory and strategy of colonial revolution and proletarian revolution, and it is also the theory and strategy of the people's democratic dictatorship in China today. This is the magic weapon for the victory of the Chinese revolution. But in the eyes of American imperialism, it is a most terrible thing that makes people turn pale at the mention of it. Therefore, in the White Paper of American imperialism, it is specifically called "foreign system" and is slanderously used to sow discord. But our Chinese people's revolution has more than a hundred years of rich experience, and we have a deep understanding and knowledge of the essence of imperialism. That is to say, the system that American imperialism dislikes is the system that we Chinese people like and believe is the most capable of improving the lives of our Chinese people. We must only raise our vigilance, strengthen our study of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly study Lenin's "Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism," and study Chairman Mao's "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship" again and again, so that proletarian internationalism and revolutionary patriotism can be highly developed in China, and we can completely smash the conspiracies and attacks of American imperialism!

Cao Zhilin
　　Acheson painstakingly wanted to instigate a class of Chinese "democratic individualists" to stir up trouble in the people's democratic camp and "cooperate from within and without" with the remaining military forces of Chiang Kai-shek, so as to stop the revolution. But it never expected that this "self-confessed" White Paper would expose the ugly face of American imperialism's aggression against China to the world, and it was simply a public declaration that it would be hostile to the Chinese people to the end. As a result, people who originally could not see through the mask of American imperialism and had illusions about it suddenly realized and became even more enthusiastic about resisting. The result is tantamount to American imperialism educating the people about so-called "democratic individualism"! The "democratic individualists" that American imperialism expects are moving towards the people's democratic camp day by day in the high tide of national liberation and victory, which is an inevitable trend. Therefore, American imperialism's conspiracy will undoubtedly fall through completely again. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, rectify our own camp, prepare for struggle, and in the continuous struggle of ideological consciousness, smash the illusions about American imperialism.

Xiao Shuzi
　　The U.S. State Department, in order to cover up its failure and to cope with American capitalists and Congress and continue to deceive the people, issued this White Paper that reverses black and white. To the outside world, it is using its trick of sowing discord and using democratic individualist elements to split China's united front and undermine Sino-Soviet friendly relations. We should raise our vigilance, study Marxism-Leninism, transform our personal thinking, thoroughly eradicate illusions about the United States, resolutely lean to one side under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, stand in the world's democratic revolutionary camp, unite as one, and overthrow American imperialism.

Xie Feng
　　We clearly understand that this White Paper is the helpless confession of American imperialism's disastrous defeat in destroying the Chinese revolution, and it is a statement by American imperialism that it will continue to carry out new conspiracies to destroy the forces of the Chinese people now and in the future. Our Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang should express a solemn statement on this aggressive White Paper of American imperialism in order to expose the cunning schemes of American imperialism. At the same time, we must strengthen our organization, strengthen our strength, and earnestly smash any conspiracy by American imperialism to destroy the forces of the Chinese people.

　　国民党革命委员会举行座谈会
  　驳斥白皮书准备战斗　（续完）
    李世璋
    毛主席在“论人民民主专政”一文中，曾指出一边倒是孙中山先生积四十年之经验，和中共积二十八年经验所发现的革命真理，今天我们来看孙先生的三大政策，和致苏联遗书，以及临终的遗嘱，不就是彻底一边倒的政策吗？所以，凡属中山先生革命的信徒，应该以真诚的态度，遵从毛主席的指示，来武装自己的思想，清除一切有害于革命的思想。坚决向和平民主阵线一边倒，不许摇摆，不许有中间派的存在，更须提高警惕，严防伪装潜入的美帝的第五纵队，来分化人民民主阵线，只有这样，才能粉碎美帝一切阴谋，才能巩固革命的胜利！
    陈此生
    所谓“民主个人主义”，除苏联外各国都有其基础，不过它的基础在各国有厚薄的不同罢了。它的基础就是资产阶级。中国有强大的共产党，有强大的人民解放军，有强大的统一战线；同时中国的官僚买办资产阶级倒下去了，中小资产阶级是和帝国主义有深仇的。我们一定会使美帝大失败。毛泽东先生的“发展进步势力，争取中间势力，孤立顽固势力”的斗争方针，也是“放之四海而皆准”的。发展进步势力和争取中间势力这两项工作愈搞得好，帝国主义的势力就愈孤立，就愈容易打倒。
    余心清
    美帝在他一贯的宣传中强调他们的民主方式，并且希望别的国家也接受他们这种民主方式。我们读了白皮书以后，就知道他的这种民主；一、是以武器援助另一个国家的反动派的民主；二、在中国是扶植一个独裁的家伙去镇压大多数人民的民主；三、违背一个国家大多数人的意愿的民主。以上这几点看法，在魏德迈来到北平时，我曾剀切的和他说过，当然他是不会接受我这种意见的。现在我要正告美国人：（一）所谓“民主个人主义”在世界革命的历史中从未有成功过，在中国也决不会成功的。（二）梦想以武力战胜是愚蠢的。（三）以工农为基础的中国民主革命是一定成功的，反此，就是与中国人民为敌。同时我曾经是一个基督信徒，所以我要向全世界基督教人士说：一、帝国主义想以武力征服世界是破坏和平，违背正义和真理的。二、过去基督教盲目的附和帝国主义是应该检讨和改正的。三、共产主义的胜利是基督教幻想的社会主义的最后完成。
    李子诵
    此次美帝发表白皮书，坦白供认了侵略中国罪行，但还隐瞒了很多重要的事实。例如以签订不平等的中美商约，要求在华获得海空军基地、特权，为援助反动政权的条件，乃至美兵杀害我人民，奸污我妇女等侵害中国人民利益等事实，真是不胜缕举，然而白皮书都没有坦白承认，反而说美国对中国有传统的“友谊”！我们中国人民给美帝害透了，我们每个人都是被害的人，都有权象检举特务一样，检举美帝在华侵略杀人罪行，让全世界人士更清楚认识它的真面目。
    秦元邦
    马列主义是殖民地革命和无产阶级革命的理论和策略，同时也是今日中国人民民主专政底理论和策略。这是中国革命取得胜利的法宝。可是在美帝的眼光看来，却是一个最可怕的谈虎色变的东西，所以，在美帝的白皮书中特被称为“外来制度”，而加以挑拨离间的中伤。但我们中国人民革命有了一百多年的丰富经验，对于帝国主义的本质，已有深刻的了解与认识。这就是说，美帝所不喜欢的制度，就是我们中国人民所喜欢的，认为最能够改善我们中国人民生活的制度。我们只有提高我们的警觉，加强我们对于马列主义毛泽东思想的学习，把列宁的“帝国主义论”彻头彻尾的研究一番，把毛主席的“论人民民主专政”，学习再学习，使无产阶级的国际主义和革命的爱国主义，高度的发扬于中国，才能把美帝的阴谋和进攻彻底粉碎！
    曹志麟
    艾奇逊煞费苦心的想鼓动中国“民主个人主义”者的一类人，在人民民主阵营中，捣起乱来，与蒋介石残余军事力量“里应外合”，便可使革命止步。可是它想不到这篇“不打自招”的白皮书，恰好向全世界暴露了美帝侵略中国的狰狞面目，简直是公开声明它要和中国人民敌对到底的一篇供状。这样一来，使原来对美帝假面具看不清楚并寄予幻想的人们，一旦恍然大悟，更加激起反抗的热情，结果无异是美帝替人民教育了所谓“民主个人主义”！美帝所期待的“民主个人主义者”在今天全国解放胜利高潮中，一天一天的走向人民民主阵营，乃是情势所必然。因此，美帝的这一阴谋，无疑的又要全部落空。在中国共产党和毛主席领导之下整肃自己的阵营，准备斗争，在不断的思想意识斗争中，来粉碎对美帝的幻想。
    萧树滋
    美帝国务院为掩饰其失败并为达到应付美国资本家、议会，继续欺骗人民的目的，所以发表了这颠倒黑白的白皮书；对外则逞其挑拨离间的伎俩，利用民主个人主义分子分裂中国统一战线，破坏中苏友好关系。我们应提高警觉，学习马列主义，改造个人思想，彻底的革除对美幻想，在中国共产党领导之下，坚决地一边倒，站在世界民主革命阵营团结一致，打倒美国帝国主义。
    谢丰
    我们很明显的了解，这部白皮书，就是美帝破坏中国革命而遭遇惨败的无可奈何的供状，就是美帝说明现在与将来继续进行破坏中国人民力量的新阴谋。我们民革对于美帝这种具有侵略性的白皮书，应该有一种严正的表示，以暴露美帝侵略的狡计；同时，还要健全我们的组织，加强我们的力量，切实的去粉碎美帝破坏中国人民力量的任何阴谋。
