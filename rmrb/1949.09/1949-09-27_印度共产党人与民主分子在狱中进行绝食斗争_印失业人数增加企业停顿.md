　　Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 25th. TASS, Delhi: Imprisoned communists and democrats in many Indian prisons are continuing their hunger strike to demand improved living conditions in the prisons. One hundred and thirty Communist Party members in Calcutta Central Jail have been on hunger strike for seven consecutive days. In various prisons in East Punjab, 1,153 Communists have been on hunger strike since September 20th.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 25th. TASS, Delhi, 23rd: The recent closure of several enterprises in Kanpur (United Provinces) has increased the number of unemployed there by 15,000. Several textile mills and sugar refineries are also expected to close down. Due to the decline in people's purchasing power and the factory owners' attempts to raise prices, warehouses are piled high with finished products, so enterprises have to stop work. The impact on handmade leather craftsmen and ghee manufacturers in the United Provinces is particularly severe. In Agra, 400 handicraft leather shops have recently closed down.

　　印度共产党人与民主分子在狱中进行绝食斗争
    印失业人数增加企业停顿
    【新华社北平二十五日电】塔斯社德里讯：印度许多监狱中被监禁的共产党人与民主分子继续进行绝食斗争，要求改善监狱中的生活条件。加尔各答中央监狱中一百三十名共产党员刻已连续绝食七天。东旁遮普的各监狱里，一千一百五十三名共产党人自九月二十日起即开始绝食。
    【新华社北平二十五日电】塔斯社德里二十三日讯：近来孔坡（联合省）若干企业的停顿，使那里的失业人数增加了一万五千人。预料若干纺织厂和炼糖厂，亦将倒闭。由于人民购买力的降低和厂主力求提高价格，仓库中堆积着大量成品，因此企业就不得不停止工作。联合省内手工皮匠和牛油制造商受到的打击，特别严重。在亚格拉四百家手工业皮革店已于最近倒闭。
