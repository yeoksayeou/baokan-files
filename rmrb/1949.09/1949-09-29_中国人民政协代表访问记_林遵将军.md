Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Delegate Visit

    General Lin Zun
    Lin Mo

    When the reporter met with General Lin Zun, he first recounted the uprising of the original Kuomintang Navy's Second Fleet. He said: The Second Fleet had more than 70 ships of various sizes. In addition to the old ships, there were those given to the Kuomintang by the United States and Britain, and those received from Japan as reparations. Originally, they were defending the coastline south of Lianyungang, but later, because the powerful People's Liberation Army was about to cross the Yangtze River and the situation in the Yangtze River became tense, the Chiang bandits transferred us to the Yangtze River,妄想 vainly hoping to use the Second Fleet's flesh and blood to block the People's Liberation Army's advance. But his wishful thinking was wrong. When the People's Liberation Army's offensive to cross the river began, the Kuomintang bandit troops retreated at the mere sight of the PLA. On April 23rd, we raised the banner of the Navy's Second Uprising on the river near Nanjing and threw ourselves into the embrace of the people. This matter was very unexpected by the Chiang bandits and was also a heavy blow to the weak morale of the remaining Kuomintang troops.

    General Lin Zun said indignantly: "When the Kuomintang bandit gang learned of the Second Fleet's uprising, they sent planes to bomb and strafe us continuously from April 28th to May 6th. We immediately opened fire with anti-aircraft guns to return the fire. Now, all the officers and soldiers of the Second Fleet are burying themselves in study, preparing to cross the sea to liberate Taiwan in the near future, to perform meritorious service for the people, and to redeem their past crimes against the people."

    He then said: "I feel extremely honored to participate in the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is an epoch-making event in Chinese history and a great undertaking in Chinese politics. Immediately following the CPPCC, the Central People's Government will be established. Under the leadership of the new Central Government and the Chinese Communist Party, the people of the whole country will successively set off a climax of economic, cultural, and national defense construction."

    "Chairman Mao has clearly told us in his opening speech at the CPPCC that the new China will establish a strong navy. All the officers and soldiers of my Second Fleet are willing to work continuously under the leadership of Chairman Mao to complete this glorious task. I personally believe that in the near future, the new China will have a strong navy to defend our sacred territory."

　　中国人民政协代表访问记
    林遵将军
    林沫
    记者会见林遵将军的时候，他首先追述了原国民党海军第二舰队起义的经过。他说：第二舰队共有大小船舰七十余只，其中除旧有船只外，有美国和英国赠送国民党的，有从日本接收和赔偿得来的。原是防守连云港以南的海岸线，后来因为强大的人民解放军即将渡江，长江形势紧张，蒋匪才把我们调进长江来，妄想用第二舰队的血肉来阻挡人民解放军前进，但他的这一如意算盘打错了；当人民解放军渡江攻势开始，国民党匪军就望风败退，我们于四月二十三日在南京附近的江面上，揭起了海军第二次起义的大旗，投到了人民的怀抱。这一件事情很出乎蒋匪意料之外，而对于国民党残余军队的薄弱士气也是一个沉重的打击。
    林遵将军愤慨地说：“当国民党匪帮知道第二舰队起义的消息后，曾从四月二十八日到五月六日，接连派飞机来轰炸扫射，我们就立刻拉开高射炮还击。现在第二舰队的全体官兵正埋头学习，准备不久的将来渡海解放台湾，为人民立功，借以赎回过去反人民的罪过。”
    接着他说：“参加人民政协，感到十二万分的荣幸。中国人民政协在中国历史上是一件划时代的大事，是中国政治上的一个伟大创业。紧接着政协之后，中央人民政府便要成立，全国人民在新中央政府和中国共产党的领导下，将相继掀起一个经济、文化和国防建设的高潮。”
    “毛主席在政协开幕词中已明白地告诉我们，新中国将要建立一支强大的海军。我第二舰队全体官兵愿在毛主席的领导下，为完成这一光荣的任务而不断努力。我个人相信在不久的将来新中国就将有一支强大的海军来捍卫我们神圣的国土。”
