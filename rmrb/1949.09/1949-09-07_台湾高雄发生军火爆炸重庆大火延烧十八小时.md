Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 6th -- According to a Kuomintang Central News Agency dispatch from Taipei: An ammunition explosion occurred in Kaohsiung Port, Taiwan, on August 23rd. The "Zhongli," a merchant ship used by the Kuomintang bandit gang to transport ammunition, was sunk by the explosion. All 980 tons of military equipment and artillery shells on board that had not yet been unloaded exploded. Nearby ships, wharves, warehouses, and port authority facilities were also partially destroyed. The Taiwan Sugar Corporation lost 26,000 tons of sugar stored on the wharf. According to preliminary investigations, the number of dead and injured on the wharf and on the ship exceeded 500. When smoke was seen coming from the ship's hold, some suggested that the ship be immediately weighed anchor and moved away from the port or scuttled, but this suggestion was not implemented. It was only long after the fire started that fire engines were called in from neighboring counties to provide assistance. Furthermore, according to a dispatch from Chongqing on the 3rd by the same news agency: A major fire in the Shaanxi Street, Chaotianmen, and Zhongzheng Road areas of Chongqing burned from 4:00 PM on the 2nd to 10:00 AM on the 3rd, lasting a full eighteen hours. Approximately ten thousand houses were burned down. There were 615 corpses found on the ground. The number of those deeply buried in the rubble or who perished in the river is unknown. Nearly 100,000 residents were left homeless. After the fire broke out, no tap water could be found to fight the fire. By the time tap water arrived at the fire zone, the flames had already spread to hundreds of locations.

　　台湾高雄发生军火爆炸
  　重庆大火延烧十八小时
    【新华社北平六日电】据国民党中央社台北消息披露：台湾高雄港于八月二十三日发生军火爆炸事件。为国民党匪帮载运军火的商轮众利号被炸沉没。载在船上尚未及卸下的九百八十吨军用器材和炮弹全部爆炸，附近船只、码头、仓库及港务局设备亦被炸毁一部，台糖公司存在码头上的糖被烧掉二万六千吨。据初步调查，码头及船上死伤人员在五百人以上。当船舱冒烟时，即有人主张将该船立即起锚离港或加以凿沉，但这一主张未被实现。而在起火以后很久，始由邻县调来救火车施救。又据该社重庆三日讯：重庆陕西街朝天门、中正路一带大火，从二日下午四时延烧到三日上午十时才完，足足烧了十八个钟头，被焚房屋在万幢左右，被烧死陈尸于地面者有六百十五人，深埋于瓦砾中及葬身鱼腹者更不知有多少，近十万居民无家可归。当火警发生后，竟找不到自来水施救，等自来水送到火警区时，火头已经蔓延出数百支。
