　　Why Are We Separated from the Masses?
    Xiao Nan
    After listening to Comrade Jiang Nanxiang's report, we clearly understood that the basic task of the Communist Youth League in school work is to carry out New Democracy learning. Of course, we said long ago that learning is the basic task of the Youth League, but we did not implement it, which led to the Youth League being separated from the masses. Why are we separated from the masses and how can we avoid being separated from the masses? This is the problem we urgently need to solve today.
    Why are we separated from the masses? The following review should be made:
    (1) Unclear direction and tasks: We have the enthusiasm for work, but we do not know how to use the guidance of theory; we regard helping students to progress as the guiding principle of our work, but we do not realize the long-term nature of the work, but only impatiently stuff a set of half-baked political theories into the students. Moreover, we regard the development of the organization as an important task, and only focus on progressive students, and do not care about the vast majority of middle-of-the-road students. In this way, we will naturally be separated from them.
    (2) Not regarding ourselves as members of the masses: It is a fact that Youth League members are the backbone of the youth masses and have a higher degree of political awareness than ordinary students. But it would be terrible if we subjectively think that we are superior to others. For example, when explaining problems to students, we know a little bit about it, but we say: "Don't you even understand this principle?" This attitude of being a teacher often alienates students. Also, in the "study movement," we often adopt the attitude of instigating others and clamoring for learning, but we do not pay attention to learning ourselves, so that students misunderstand that Youth League members only teach others to learn, and look at us differently.
    (3) Old-fashioned underground work methods: We cannot sincerely and frankly discuss work with the masses. For example, when running a cooperative in school, some students disagree, and although we agree, we hesitate to put forward positive reasons, fearing that people will say we "have a standpoint." Also, when the work is conveyed within the League, we always whisper to each other in a mysterious way, which makes the students feel inexplicable and misunderstand the Youth League.
    (4) In the role of model and leader, we do not pay attention to improving thinking through unity: We think that treating students well is enough to achieve unity, and we do not further understand and help students ideologically; in the action of model and leader, we also think that we can do it ourselves, and there is no need to explain and publicize. For example, in the warm-up movement, the League put forward the slogan of not staying up late, and the members all did it; but many students were still staying up late, and therefore felt that we were too prominent. In fact, if we sincerely explain to them the disadvantages of staying up late, and then set an example to influence everyone, the students will definitely feel that the Youth League members are really thinking about the interests of the majority of students, and the Youth League is their own organization.
    In short, because of the unclear direction of work, the mistakes in working methods, and the acute illness, it is inevitable to be separated from the masses.
    As for how not to be separated from the masses? Judging from the specific situation of past work, first of all, we must emphasize that the relationship between the League and the masses is as close as fish and water, blood and flesh; secondly, we must implement the guiding principle of school work and correct the so-called view that learning is to restore the old learning; finally, we must strengthen the mass viewpoint and care about the vital interests of the masses, because the Youth League is an organization that represents the common interests of the broad masses of young people, and being responsible to the masses is being responsible to the organization.

### 我们为什么会脱离群众？

　　我们为什么会脱离群众？
    萧南
    听了蒋南翔同志的报告，使我们明确地了解到青年团在学校工作的基本任务是开展新民主主义的学习。固然我们很早就说过学习是青年团的基本任务，但却没有将它贯彻下来，以致使青年团脱离群众。为什么会脱离群众及如何才不脱离群众？这是今天我们急需要解决的问题。
    为什么我们会脱离群众？应该作如下的检讨：
    （一）方针任务不明确：我们虽有工作的热情，但却不会运用理论的指导；把帮助同学进步当做工作方针，却没有认识到工作的长期性，而只是急躁地向同学们硬塞一套半生不熟的政治理论。而且，我们把发展组织当做重要任务，两眼只钉住进步同学，对绝大多数的中间同学不予关心。这样，当然会与他们隔离开来。
    （二）不把自己当成群众中的一员：青年团员是青年群众中的骨干，比一般同学的政治觉悟程度要高些是事实。可是我们主观上要认为自己高人一头，那就糟了。例如当给同学解释问题时，本来自己略知一二，却说：“这个道理也不懂吗？”这种以教导者自居的态度往往疏远了同学。又如在“学习运动”中，我们往往抱着策动别人的态度，高嚷学习，但自己对学习却并不重视，以致使同学误会青年团员只会教别人学习，而另眼看待我们。
    （三）地下工作方式老一套：不能赤诚坦率地和群众商量工作。例如在学校办合作社时，有一部分同学不赞成，而我们虽然赞成，却吞吞吐吐地不取提出正面理由，怕人家说我们“有立场”。又如当团内传达工作时，总是交头接耳地显出神秘的样子，使同学们感到莫明其妙，而对青年团发生误解。
    （四）在模范带头作用中，不注意从团结中提高思想：我们认为对同学们态度很好就算做到团结了，而不进一步地从思想上，更多的了解同学，帮助同学；在模范带头行动中，也认为自己干就成了，用不着解释宣传。例如：在温课运动中，团内提出不开夜车的口号，团员们虽都做到了；但许多同学仍在开夜车，反而因此觉得我们太突出了。其实，我们若诚恳的对他们说明开夜车的坏处，再以身作则影响大家，同学们一定会感到青年团员真是为广大同学的利益着想，青年团就是自己的组织。
    总之，因为工作的方针不明确，和工作方式方法的错误，又加上害急性病，所以必然地脱离群众了。
    至于如何不脱离群众呢？从过去工作的具体情况上看，首先我们要强调团群关系是鱼和水、血和肉一样的密切关系；其次是要贯彻学校工作的方针，纠正所谓学习就是恢复旧的学习观点；最后是加强群众观点，关心群众切身利益，因为青年团就是代表广大青年的共同利益的组织，对群众负责就是对组织负责。
