Municipal Work in August
    City Government News Department

    The North Peace City All-Circles Representative Conference, convened by the Beiping Military Control Commission and the People's Government, was held for a total of six days from August 9th to 14th. The conference broadly included representatives from various democratic parties, people's organizations, professions, classes, organs, troops, minority nationalities, and other patriotic democratic individuals, totaling 330 people (the quota was 332, but because Mayor Ye concurrently held three representative identities from the government, the CCP Municipal Committee, and the Military Control Commission, the actual number was 330). Mayor Ye Jianying gave a "Report on the Half-Year Takeover and Administration of Beiping City" to the conference. Deputy Mayor Zhang Youyu and Bureau Chief Tan Zhengwen gave supplementary reports on financial and economic work and public security work, respectively. All the representatives listened and unanimously expressed satisfaction and made resolutions. Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and Vice Chairman Zhou personally attended and gave many valuable instructions, which made the atmosphere of the meeting excited and boiling. A total of 248 proposals were submitted to the conference. After examination and discussion, those that should be and could be handled were handed over to the Municipal Government for handling. Those that should be handled but could not be handled temporarily were explained and postponed or handled with discretion. Only three proposals were retained, and two proposals were rejected. The conference resolution put forward three current tasks for the people of Beiping: The first is to continue to eliminate bandits, special agents, and counter-revolutionaries; the second is to continue to restore and develop production, streamline and economize, disperse the unemployed population, and crack down on speculative merchants; and the third is to continue to develop the people's cultural and educational undertakings. The conference also resolved to establish a permanent public opinion institution—the All-Circles Representative Conference Consultative Committee. After the closing of the conference, the Municipal People's Government continuously discussed various proposals at its administrative meetings, and all units of the Municipal Government conveyed the conference resolutions to all cadres separately and made concrete plans for implementing the resolutions.

    By the end of August, the Civil Affairs Bureau had basically completed the work of cleaning up the coffins deposited in temples in the urban and rural areas. All 2,796 deposited coffins, except for a very small number, have been cleared and buried, freeing up 1,290 rooms. For the scattered beggars who reappeared on the streets after two rounds of shelter, the Civil Affairs Bureau decided to continue to take them in. To this end, the public security bureaus of various districts have increased the deployment of cadres to actively carry out the work. From the 18th to the 31st, 346 beggars have been taken in. In addition, from the end of July to the end of August, 275 beggars with labor capacity were taken in and formed the third batch of labor brigades, which can be sent to Chahar South and Yanbei areas to participate in agricultural production work.

    Following the implementation of real estate registration in the city, the Land Administration Bureau began issuing real estate ownership certificates on August 15. By the end of August, 4,597 registered owners had been announced, and 1,010 real estate ownership certificates had been issued. The Land Administration Bureau also began a general survey of real estate prices throughout the city on August 24 to clearly divide the standards for housing grades. The city is divided into twelve survey groups according to the twelve administrative districts of the urban and rural areas. The survey work is divided into three steps: regional survey, real estate price survey, and collection of materials to distinguish real estate grades and set prices. In August, 219 cases of housing rent disputes were resolved in the city. The trial implementation of collective mediation in various districts has achieved significant results and valuable experience.

    Since the signing of the collective contract by the city's Chinese medicine industry, there are still five companies with labor-management disputes. After the Labor Bureau convened representatives from the labor and management sides of the above-mentioned five companies, the disputes were quickly resolved through democratic discussion based on the contract. In August, the Labor Bureau mediated labor disputes in Hongshun Coal Mine, Yongda Stone Factory, and Guixiangcun, and arbitrated labor disputes in Zhongnong Flour Mill and Jielong Glue Factory. It also continued to conduct investigations in the carpet industry and convened a forum for the labor side of the dyeing and weaving industry.

    In order to facilitate urban and rural transportation, the Construction Bureau has begun to repair the road surface of Guang'anmen Inner Street, Xuanwumen, and Xuanwumen Outer Street. The project of repairing the city walls and filling the city wall openings is also proceeding smoothly with the strong assistance of the garrison troops, and will be completed soon. The People's Government has promulgated the Provisional Regulations on the Management of the Construction Industry and the Provisional Regulations on the Management of Architects. The Construction Bureau has begun to handle the registration of the construction industry and strengthen the inspection and management of public buildings.

    Under the leadership of the Suburban Work Committee, the flood prevention and waterlogging prevention work in the suburbs was concluded in August, freeing 150,000 mu of low-lying land from flooding and rescuing 54,741 mu of submerged land.

    In order to solve the problem of school enrollment for workers' children, the Education Bureau added 39 classes to the municipal primary schools in the urban and suburban areas in August, enrolling 1,340 workers' children, and is actively planning the second phase of class expansion in primary schools and is starting to set up workers' children classes in middle schools. The city's public and private primary and secondary schools have started school at the end of August. In order to solve the tuition problem of private schools, the Education Bureau convened a forum for principals, faculty, and student representatives of private middle schools on August 21. Of the 71 schools attending, about two-thirds, or 48 schools, had their tuition problems resolved. At the meeting, the schools exchanged experiences in solving tuition problems in a democratic manner. In the middle of the month, the People's Government promulgated the "Provisional Management Measures for Private Primary and Secondary Schools in Beiping City" and the "Provisional Organizational Outline of the Board of Directors of Private Primary and Secondary Schools in Beiping City" to reorganize and support the city's private primary and secondary schools and vocational schools.

    The Health Bureau continued to carry out the clean-up and fly-catching campaign in early August. From July 29 to August 9, a total of more than 32 million flies were caught in the city and have been incinerated by the Health Bureau. The disposal method for transporting manure from the city to outside the city has been formulated and has been implemented since August 22. In late August, encephalitis was discovered in the city. The Health Bureau immediately launched a publicity campaign to prevent encephalitis, mobilized citizens to kill mosquitoes, and sent DDT spraying teams to disinfect the environment near patients, which greatly reduced the threat of encephalitis.

    In August, under the unified leadership of the Municipal Finance and Economics Committee, the economic departments of the People's Government concentrated their efforts to stabilize the prices that began to rise sharply at the end of July. In terms of economic strength, the Trade Company sold a large amount of materials to ensure supply, the People's Bank temporarily stopped unnecessary loans and tightened money supply, and the Municipal Taxation Bureau also began to collect business income tax for the second half of the 37th year of the Republic of China... In terms of administrative management, led by the Industry and Commerce Bureau, starting from August 2, more than 100 cadres were transferred from the Municipal Taxation Bureau and the People's Bank to cooperate with the Public Security Bureau. They were divided into five major groups and several subgroups according to the jurisdiction of the tax offices to inspect various trading markets and key merchants. In accordance with the spirit of the resolutions of the All-Circles Representative Conference and the actual needs of regulating and reorganizing the market, preparations are being actively made to establish two exchanges for grain and yarn. In the management of private industry, the Industry and Commerce Bureau is carrying out the transformation of trade associations and has established a system for each industry to report production and sales in writing every month. Commercial registration is still in progress. In the second batch of 95 industries, except for a few individual problems that are still being resolved, the summary and issuance of business licenses has begun.

    The collection of business income tax for the second half of the 37th year of the Republic of China is nearing completion, and most merchants have paid their taxes. The total number of taxes is 2 million points. The tax amount per point is 1,000 yuan. The burden includes 34,994 households in 153 industries in the city. In order to promote the development and prosperity of industry and commerce, the People's Government announced provisional measures for tax reduction and exemption on August 7, stipulating that 21 types of commercial activities, including most industries and export, health, and transportation businesses, will be subject to tax reductions of 10% to 40%, and stipulating that industrial joint-stock companies with significant technological innovations or those that are beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood can also apply to the North China People's Government for approval for separate tax reductions.

    The work efficiency of the Beiping Municipal People's Court improved in August. As of the 30th, a total of 2,008 cases were received in one month, and 1,658 cases have been concluded. The circuit trial team has completed its trial in Mentougou District, and the political impact is very good. This work will be strengthened in the future.

    By the end of August, nearly 3,000 members of reactionary parties and groups in the city had registered with the registration office of the Public Security Bureau in accordance with the measures announced by the Military Control Commission. The Public Security Bureau has been publishing the list of registered reactionaries since the 30th, so that citizens from all walks of life can distinguish between the enemy and ourselves and supervise these reactionary parties and groups to prevent them from continuing to do evil. As of August 31, the Public Security Bureau had arrested 350 members of reactionary parties and groups who attempted to sabotage government decrees, resist registration, or engage in conspiracies after registration.
