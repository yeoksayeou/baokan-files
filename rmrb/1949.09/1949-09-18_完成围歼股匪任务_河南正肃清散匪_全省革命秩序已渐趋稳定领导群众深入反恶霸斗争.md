Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng, 17th. The stage of encircling and suppressing bandits in Henan Province has come to an end, and it has now entered a new stage of comprehensively eliminating scattered and hidden bandits. Since the Second Provincial Party Congress of the Chinese Communist Party Henan Provincial Committee in June established the policy of suppressing bandits and opposing local tyrants, after two months of encirclement and suppression in July and August, the major bandit gangs in Henan have been basically crushed, and more than 27,000 people have been eliminated in the past two months. This victory has brought about a major change in the bandit suppression situation in Henan.

The Second Provincial Party Congress of the Chinese Communist Party Henan Provincial Committee in June clearly stipulated the policy of suppressing bandits and opposing local tyrants, requiring the complete elimination of bandits and the overthrow of local tyrants within a certain period, and the mobilization of the masses. After the meeting, party, government, army and people throughout the province successively made specific arrangements for bandit suppression work. First of all, various localities enabled cadres to have a correct understanding of the seriousness of the bandit situation, overcome the idea of underestimating the enemy and being paralyzed, recognize the importance of the task of bandit suppression, and conducted education on various policies related to bandit suppression. In terms of organization, bandit suppression headquarters were established at all levels according to the situation in the province, and it was specifically determined that the three districts of Shan (Zhou) Luo (Yang), Huang (Chuan), and Nan (Yang) were the key areas for bandit suppression, the Xuchang district was the key area for mobilizing the masses, and the others were general areas for clearing scattered and hidden bandits.

After in-depth mobilization and education, all commanders and fighters of the troops were in high spirits and unanimously expressed their firm determination to "never withdraw until the bandits are wiped out," and competed to take oaths, determined to "not be afraid of heat, not be afraid of hunger, and not be afraid of climbing mountains and running errands" and other loud slogans. Around July 25th, the troops launched a large-scale military suppression against the bandits under a unified deployment. In the suppression, first use sufficient troops to strictly surround the bandits, seize the key points, and give them a annihilating blow to disrupt the bandit deployment. Then, shift the focus to political offensives supplemented by military suppression, strive for and disintegrate the bandit masses, and persuade them to surrender to us. Tactically, they divided and combined forces, made surprise attacks, pursued fiercely, and blockaded and surrounded. In late July, the New First Division of Li Zikui, under the bandit "Yu-Xi Bandit Suppression Headquarters," under the jurisdiction of Ling (Bao) Wen (Xiang) area of the Shanluo Bandit Suppression Zone, was wiped out two detachments. In the Nanyang Bandit Suppression Zone, the deputy commander of the bandit "Northwest Garrison Headquarters Yu-Xi Sub-district," Ren Taisheng's troops in the Nei (Xiang) Zhe (Chuan) area, after the joint attack and political offensive of the various units of the People's Liberation Army, Wang Zixian, the deputy division commander of the Ren Bandit, led a part of the bandits to surrender to the People's Liberation Army. After a short week of attacks by the People's Liberation Army in late July, the large bandit gangs throughout the province collapsed one after another, and some of them dispersed and hid, attempting to rebuild bandit nests and preserve their strength. At this point, the stage of encircling and suppressing large bandits in the province was largely over.

After the bandits were disrupted, we quickly moved to a stage of dispersed suppression. The bandits adopted a two-faced policy, one of faking the surrender of weapons and registering, and the other of controlling the bandit masses, dispersing and fleeing in mountainous areas where our strength could not reach, attempting to rebuild bandit nests and preserve their strength. In response to this change in the situation of struggle, in the method of struggle, our troops closely cooperated with local cadres, unified leadership, transformed combat teams into work teams, cooperated with local areas to mobilize the masses with emphasis, opposed local tyrants, and launched an in-depth struggle against dispersed and hidden bandits. At the same time, in order to smash the two-faced policy of the bandits' false surrender and false registration, a wide-ranging political offensive was further launched, on the one hand, striving for wavering elements among the bandits to surrender their weapons and register to repent, and on the other hand, resolutely suppressing stubborn ringleaders. The remaining bandits were relentlessly continued to be subjected to military suppression. After Ren Bandit Taisheng was severely attacked by our Nanyang District Bandit Suppression Force in July, he pretended to negotiate surrender to us, while recruiting scattered bandits, grabbing Ding Pai grain, and attempting to break through. A certain unit of our Fourth Field Army and a part of the Nanyang area armed forces launched another attack on August 17. Bandit Deputy Commander Ren Taisheng, Chief of Staff Yang Chunting, New Second Division Deputy Division Commander Hu Junping, New Third Division Deputy Division Commander Ning Ganchen and others were forced to surrender.

After entering the suppression stage, our troops and local cadres, under the unified leadership of the party committees at all levels, gave full play to the role of the work team, generally able to rely on the masses, investigate and study, correctly grasp the policies, abide by the mass discipline, actively help the masses with labor, and control the puppet Baojia personnel, and use the internal contradictions of the bandits, thus smoothly confiscating a large number of bandit guns, and striving for a large number of bandit puppet personnel to register and rehabilitate. Because of our firm attitude towards bandit suppression and opposition to local tyrants, coupled with the influence of the victory of bandit suppression, the broad masses of the people initially broke their concerns and set off a upsurge in opposing bandits and opposing local tyrants. Many people automatically complained to us, informed us or reported bandits, and some even automatically rose up to capture scattered bandits and confiscate bandit guns. For example, more than 3,000 people in Zhaobao, Yiyang, came out together, holding hoes, knives and spears, and captured the giant bandit Wang Jun alive. In this mass bandit suppression movement, bandits in various places had no way to go, and many people automatically surrendered. With the active assistance of the broad masses of the people, a total of 23,277 bandits were eliminated in the stage of clearing scattered bandits in August. Together with the 3,883 bandits wiped out in July, a total of 27,160 bandits were eliminated in July and August, and more than 33,300 guns were seized. Openly organized bandits in Henan Province have been mostly eliminated, and the revolutionary order in the province is gradually stabilizing.

The current problem is that complacency and complacency are growing in some cadres, satisfied with the victories they have achieved, thinking that it is "almost there"; they do not have a sufficient understanding of the insidious conspiracy of the remaining bandits to disperse and hide, continue to control the masses, in order to wait for an opportunity to rise again. Some cadres also underestimate the current revolutionary enthusiasm and demands of the masses, and are hampered in their work, unable to adapt to the demands of the masses and resolutely lead the masses to carry out an in-depth struggle against local tyrants. Therefore, the Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has recently issued instructions, pointing out that at present, all localities should overcome the ideas of underestimating the enemy, complacency, paralysis, and laxity among cadres, continue to station troops in the key areas of bandit suppression, and further develop a mass movement to oppose bandits and oppose local tyrants in order to completely eliminate all remaining bandits.

　　完成围歼股匪任务　河南正肃清散匪
    全省革命秩序已渐趋稳定领导群众深入反恶霸斗争
    【新华社开封十七日电】河南省围剿股匪阶段已告结束，现已转入全面肃清散匪潜匪的新阶段。自六月中共河南省第二届全省党代表会确定剿匪反恶霸方针后，经七、八两月的围剿，河南大股土匪已被基本上打垮，两月来被歼二万七千余人。这一胜利使河南剿匪形势发生了重大变化。
    六月间的中共河南省第二届党代表会，曾明确规定了剿匪反恶霸的方针，要求在一定时期内彻底肃清土匪，打倒恶霸，发动群众。会后，全省党政军民即相继具体布置了剿匪工作。各地首先使干部对匪情的严重性有正确的认识，克服轻敌麻痹的思想，认识剿匪任务的重要，并进行了有关剿匪的各项政策的教育。在组织上则根据全省情况，分别成立各级剿匪指挥部，并具体确定以陕（州）洛（阳）、潢（川）、南（阳）三个分区为剿匪重点区，许昌分区为发动群众的重点区，其他均为一般清剿散匪潜伏地区。
    经过深入动员教育后，部队的全体指挥员战斗员，都情绪高涨，一致坚决表示“匪不剿灭，誓不收兵”，并争相宣誓，下决心，提出“不怕热，不怕饿，不怕爬山跑腿”等响亮口号。七月二十五日前后，各部队即在统一部署下，向股匪展开大规模军事清剿。清剿中，首先用足够的兵力，严密包围土匪，抓住重点，予以歼灭性打击，打乱土匪部署。接着就转变以政治攻势为主，军事清剿为辅，争取、瓦解匪众，规劝其向我投降。战术上则分进合击，奔袭进剿，穷追猛打，封锁包围。七月下旬，陕洛剿匪区灵（宝）阌（乡）地区匪“豫西剿总指挥部”下辖之新一师李子奎部，即被歼灭两支队。南阳剿匪区内（乡）浙（川）地区匪“西北绥署豫西分区”副司令任泰升部经解放军各部合击和政治攻势，任匪之副师长王紫仙率匪一部向解放军投降。经解放军七月下旬短短一周时间的打击，全省大股土匪即先后溃散，其中一部分则分散隐蔽起来。至此，全省围剿股匪阶段即大体结束。
    土匪被打乱以后，我即迅速转入分散清剿阶段。土匪则采取两面政策，一个假缴枪、假登记，一面控制匪众，在我力量不能达到的山区中分散流窜，企图重建匪巢，保存势力。针对这种斗争形势的改变，在斗争的方法上，我部队与地方干部密切配合，统一领导，变战斗队为工作队，配合地方上有重点地发动群众，反对恶霸，向分散隐蔽的土匪展开深入的斗争。同时，为粉碎土匪假投降、假登记的两面政策，乃进一步展开广泛的政治攻势，一面争取土匪中动摇分子缴枪登记悔过，一面坚决镇压顽强抵抗的首恶分子。对残存股匪则毫不放松地继续进行军事清剿。任股匪泰升在七月份为我南阳区剿匪部队痛击后，曾向我假装接洽投诚，同时则收编散匪，抓丁派粮，企图突围。我第四野战军某部及南阳地区武装一部，乃于八月十七日再次发起攻击。匪副司令任泰升、参谋长杨春亭、新二师副师长胡均平，新三师副师长宁干臣等被迫投降。
    在转入清剿阶段后，我部队与地方干部在各级党委统一领导下，发挥了工作队的作用，一般均能依靠群众，调查研究，正确掌握政策，遵守群众纪律，主动地帮助群众劳动，并控制伪保甲人员，利用土匪内部矛盾，因而顺利地大批收缴匪枪，并争取大批匪伪人员登记自新。广大人民因为我对剿匪反恶霸态度坚决，加以剿匪胜利的影响，初步打破顾虑，掀起了反对土匪、反对恶霸的热潮，很多人民自动向我诉苦、告密或检举土匪，有的并自动起来捕捉散匪，收缴匪枪。如伊阳赵堡一带人民三千余人一齐出动，手持镢头、刀矛，活捉巨匪王钧。各地土匪在这一群众性的剿匪运动中，走头无路，不少人自动投案。在广大群众的积极协助下，八月份清剿散匪阶段中即共消灭土匪共达二万三千二百七十七名。加上七月份歼灭股匪三千八百八十三名，七八两月合共消灭土匪二万七千一百六十名，缴枪三万三千三百余支。在河南境内公开成股的土匪，至此均被大部消灭，全省革命秩序渐趋安定。
    目前存在的问题是在某些干部中正滋长着麻痹、自满情绪，满足于既得胜利，认为“差不多”了；对残余土匪分散隐蔽，继续控制群众，以图待机再起的恶毒阴谋认识不足。也有些干部对于当前群众的革命情绪和要求估计不足，工作中束手束脚，不能适应群众的要求，坚决领导群众进行深入的反恶霸斗争。因此，中共河南省委已于日前发出指示，指出目前各地应在干部中克服轻敌、自满、麻痹、松懈的思想，在剿匪重点区应继续分散驻剿，并进一步开展群众性的反对土匪反对恶霸的运动，以彻底肃清一切残余土匪。
