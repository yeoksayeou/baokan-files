　　Preventing Encephalitis Outbreaks
  　North China Government Departments Hold Symposium on Epidemic Prevention and Hygiene Work
    [This newspaper dispatch] To effectively prevent the current epidemic of encephalitis and to study the establishment of permanent hygiene and epidemic prevention organizations in various departments, the Ministry of Health of the North China People's Government specially convened a symposium on epidemic prevention and hygiene work for all government departments on the 3rd of this month. At the meeting, Vice Minister Zhu first reported on the guidelines for health work, pointing out that epidemic prevention work is primary and treatment is secondary. Treatment only involves the skills of a few doctors, while epidemic prevention work is a mass movement that requires the power of everyone. It is a mass work, so it must be promoted by administrative power to mobilize everyone to participate in this work. Then, Captain Liu of the Epidemic Prevention Brigade reported on the symptoms and prevention methods of encephalitis. Representatives from various units also reported on the past health work and put forward opinions on future hygiene and epidemic prevention. Everyone unanimously agreed that we should first attach importance to this issue ideologically and carry out mass hygiene campaigns. They also reviewed the past bias of not paying enough attention to hygiene work. Regarding the establishment of permanent hygiene and epidemic prevention organizations, everyone unanimously agreed that "Hygiene Committees" should be established at all levels from top to bottom to guide the hygiene work of various units. Finally, everyone also passed a one-and-a-half-month hygiene work plan and two suggestions for the Ping Municipality Health Bureau. The main points of the work plan are: 1. Invite experts to give special reports on encephalitis, typhoid fever, and other topics; 2. Inspect hygiene and epidemic prevention facilities; 3. Investigate garbage in various agencies and solve difficulties in hygiene work. The suggestions to the Ping Municipality Health Bureau are: (1) Establish public toilets and prohibit urination and defecation in the streets. (2) Strengthen street hygiene management and hygiene education for citizens. Prohibit the discarding of dead animals in the streets and the dumping of chamber pot sewage on the streets.

　　防止大脑炎侵袭
  　华府各部座谈防疫卫生工作
    【本报讯】华北人民政府为了有效地防止目前正在流行的大脑炎的侵袭，并研究建立各部门永久性的卫生防疫组织，卫生部特于本月三日主持召开全府各部门的防疫卫生工作座谈会。会议首由朱副部长报告卫生工作方针，他指出防疫工作是主要的，治疗工作是次要的，治疗不过发挥几个医生的技术，而防疫工作则是群众性的，是要发挥大家的力量。也就是一个群众工作，因此就必须要由行政力量来推动动员大家共同参加这个工作，继由防疫大队刘队长报告了大脑炎的症状、预防方法等。各单位也先后报告了以往的卫生工作情况，并提出了今后卫生防疫意见。大家一致同意应先从思想上重视并开展群众性的卫生运动。并检讨了以前对卫生工作不重视的偏向。关于建立永久性的卫生防疫组织问题，大家一致认为应自上而下的建立各级“卫生委员会”，来指导各单位的卫生工作。最后大家还通过了一个半月的卫生工作计划和对平市卫生局的两点建议。工作计划主要为：一、请专人做大脑炎、伤寒等专题报告；二、检查卫生及防疫设施；三、调查各机关垃圾及解决卫生工作中的困难。对平市卫生局的建议是：（一）建立公共厕所，禁止在街道上大小便。（二）加强街道卫生管理及对市民的卫生教育。禁止在街道上抛弃死兽及在街上倾倒痰盂污水。（华北政府新闻发布室）
