　　Government and the Masses Closely Combined
  　Gold and Silver Management Achieves Success
  　Black Market Activities Have Disappeared
    [Taiyuan Electric] Taiyuan City's gold and silver management work has achieved great success in the four months since liberation. As of the end of August, a total of 653 cases of gold and silver smuggling were investigated, uncovering 575 taels of gold, 63,842 silver dollars, and 6,602 taels of silver. Large-scale black market activities in gold and silver have now disappeared, and the local currency has become the only currency in circulation. During the period of Yan Xishan's bandit rule, gold and silver were openly used, leading to rampant gold and silver black market activities in Taiyuan after liberation. Because the People's Government correctly implemented the policy of combining administrative management with mass management, closely connected with the masses, and strictly managed the market, and widely carried out propaganda and education, the management work was able to proceed smoothly. For example, gold and silver kingpins Wang Dianchen and Wang Yisan were both investigated and captured under the principle of close connection with the masses. Currently, gold and silver criminals in the city have become isolated among the masses. For example, Hu Tianen, who worked as a "middleman" for the black market, was rejected by many industrial and commercial households after being investigated and arrested by the government. Most of the other gold and silver criminals who were investigated and arrested have already confessed their guilt, realizing that only by abiding by government laws and engaging in legitimate business can they have a future. As for the remaining few gold and silver smugglers, the Shanxi Provincial Branch is currently planning to completely eliminate them.

　　政府与群众密切结合
  　并金银管理获成绩
  　黑市活动已告消声匿迹
    【太原电】太原市金银管理工作，解放以来的四个月中获得极大成绩。截至八月底统计，共查获倒卖金银案件六百五十三起，查出黄金五百七十五两，白洋六万三千八百四十二元，纹银六千六百零二两；大的金银黑市活动，目前已消声匿迹，本币已成为唯一流通的货币。在阎匪统治时期，曾公开使用金银，以致解放后的太原市场，金银暗市活动猖獗，由于人民政府正确执行了行政管理与群众管理相结合的方针，密切联系群众，严格管理市场；并广泛进行了宣传教育，故管理工作得以顺利展开。如金银巨犯王殿臣、王益三等均是在密切联系群众的方针下检举查获的。目前市内金银犯在群众中已孤立起来，如胡天恩给黑市作“跑合”，被政府查获后，许多工商户即拒绝与其往来，其他大部被查获的金银犯，均已具结悔过，认识到只有遵守政府法令，经营正当业务，才有前途。至于残存的少数金银贩，现山西省分行正计划彻底肃清中。
