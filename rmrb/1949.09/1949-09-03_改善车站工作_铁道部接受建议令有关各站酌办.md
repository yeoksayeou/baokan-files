Improving Station Work
　　The Ministry of Railways Accepts Suggestions and Instructs Relevant Stations to Handle Accordingly Comrade Xu Wei:
　　Regarding your opinions on Tianjin, Jinan, and other stations, the Ministry of Railways has instructed the relevant railway bureaus to make appropriate improvements and provides the following answers to the suggestions you made:
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Editor
　　One, (1) The method of building more mat sheds and providing more seats outside the station is good, but there are practical difficulties. Because passenger congestion is not limited to Tianjin and Jinan stations alone. The congestion at stations like Xuzhou, Bengbu, and Pukou is even more severe than at these two stations. The railway bureau will need to have comprehensive planning in the future. If more train services can be added later, or if the ticket selling method is improved, this difficulty can be resolved.
　　(2) We agree with the suggestions on improving ticket sales, ticket checking, displaying train numbers, and guiding passengers, and have informed all bureaus to pay attention to improvements.
　　(3) The method of pre-reporting the number of seats on the train so that the next station can determine how many tickets to sell has long been in place. However, sometimes, due to train delays or communication disruptions, the station has to wait until the train enters the station before it can determine the number of tickets to sell. This has resulted in many passengers waiting for a long time without being able to buy tickets. We have informed all railway bureaus to make every effort to overcome this difficulty to benefit passengers.
　　(4) According to regulations, passenger cars on mixed trains should not be attached to open or covered wagons. Because there is an extreme shortage of passenger cars, we cannot stop selling passenger tickets simply because there is a shortage of passenger cars and we do not want to find other alternatives. The result will affect transportation and inconvenience the general public. Therefore, this is a temporary expedient, a measure taken as a last resort. Once the passenger car shortage improves, this problem can be resolved.
　　(5) Regarding the convenience of women buying tickets, if there are many ticket windows at the station, and there are no other obstacles when separating them, we will consider doing so as appropriate.
　　Two, the difficulty passengers feel during entry checks at Shenyang Station has been reported to the Shenyang Railway Bureau to study improvements together with the local public security organs.
　　Three, the suggestion of regularly sending people to solicit opinions from passengers in order to make improvements at any time is very good. We have informed all railway bureaus to do so.

### 改善车站工作　铁道部接受建议令有关各站酌办

　　改善车站工作
  　铁道部接受建议令有关各站酌办徐蔚同志：
    你对天津、济南等车站提出的意见，铁道部已分别令有关路局酌加改善，并对所提建议各点解答如下：　
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　编者
    一、（１）在站外多搭席棚多设坐椅的办法很好，但事实上有困难，因为乘客拥挤不仅是津济两站，徐州蚌埠浦口等站拥挤的情形比较这两站还严重，路局将来须要有通盘的筹划，如以后能增加车次，或将售票方法改善这种困难即可解决。
    （２）关于改善售票，剪票，揭示车次及向导旅客的建议，我们赞同，已令知各局注意改进。
    （３）预报车上座位以便下站酌定卖票多少的办法，早有规定，但有时因为列车晚点，或通信发生阻碍，车站不得不等到列车进站后始能判明售票张数。这样遂影响了许多旅客等了半天买不着票，此点已令知各路局竭力克服这种困难以利乘客。
    （４）混合列车上的客车，照章不应挂敞车或蓬车，因为现在客车极感缺乏不够运用，我们不能因客车缺乏也不想其他代替方法，而停止了发售客票，结果将影响了交通，反而使一般旅客不便，所以这乃是一时的权宜措置，不得已而行之的办法，一俟客车缺乏情形好转，这个问题即可解决。
    （５）对于便利妇女买票一节，如遇车站的售票窗口多，分开时又无其他妨碍，我们酌情照办。
    二、沈阳车站入站检查旅客感觉困难一点，已令知沈阳路局会同地方公安机关研究改善。
    三、经常派人向乘客征询意见，以便随时改进一点，这个建议很好，我们已令知各路局照办。
