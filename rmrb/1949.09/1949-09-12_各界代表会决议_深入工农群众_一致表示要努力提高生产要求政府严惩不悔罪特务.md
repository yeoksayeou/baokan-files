　　Representatives' Conference Resolution
　  Go Deep Among Workers and Peasants
    Unanimously Express Determination to Increase Production and Demand the Government Severely Punish Unrepentant Special Agents
    [This City News] After the conclusion of the Beijing Municipal People's Representatives Conference, workers in various factory districts in Beijing have generally studied the various resolutions and reports of the conference. Generally, workers believe that the requirements of developing production, improving quality, and saving raw materials should be met. Workers in the soap-making industry proposed that a joint testing organization should be established to set standards for finished products to prevent crude manufacturing and improve quality. Everyone's understanding of unscrupulous merchants has also become clearer. Wang Qi, a worker at the Great Wall Printing Factory, said: "We must ban speculative merchants. We must not only do a good job in politics, but also in economics." Workers believe that the treatment of special agents in the past was too lenient, and those who are incorrigible should be resolutely suppressed. Yu Haiting, a worker in the repair team of the North China Electric Power Company, said: "The government has repeatedly given special agents the opportunity to confess, but they are still unrepentant. They should no longer be treated leniently. This leniency creates their侥幸 psychology, thinking that it doesn't matter if they confess a few days later, or even that they don't have to confess if no one asks. These kinds of people should be resolutely suppressed." Zhao Yuxiang, a female worker at the厚生 Match Factory who participated in the Beijing Municipal People's Representatives Conference, told the workers about seeing Chairman Mao. After that, some workers said: "We must work hard and strive to become labor heroes and meet Chairman Mao." The workers were very moved that Chairman Mao took an anonymous letter to the meeting for discussion. The workers said: "Chairman Mao is truly democratic and respects the people. The people have truly turned over and become masters." Hearing that so many worker representatives participated in the Beijing Municipal People's Representatives Conference, they really felt that their political status had improved. Some workers who were not active in learning said: "We can't miss classes anymore. How can we be masters of our own house if we don't study?"
    [This Newspaper News] After the conclusion of the Beijing Municipal People's Representatives Conference, various suburban areas successively convened cadres and farmer representatives from various villages to convey the message. In addition to conveying the resolutions and gains of the conference, and the reports of Comrade Peng Zhen and Mayor Ye; arrangements were also made for autumn harvesting and wheat planting, streamlining and economizing, and other work. Afterwards, cadres and farmer representatives went to the countryside separately to hold mass meetings at the village level and various types of discussion meetings. For example, Zhang Zhenying, a women's representative from the Fifteenth District, convened a mass meeting of 1,000 people after returning to her village to talk about her feelings about the conference. She enlightened the masses with her vivid speech. The Nineteenth District also organized students to go to the countryside to conduct propaganda.
    After this widespread propaganda, the village representatives and the general farmers in the suburbs had a basic understanding of the spirit of the conference: After listening to the cadres conveying Chairman Mao's speech, the farmer representatives in the Fifteenth District were extremely happy. They said: "Now we have really turned over. In the past, it was harder than ascending to heaven to see a small Kuomintang official!" Representatives from the Nineteenth District said: "Chairman Mao is really great. He attaches so much importance to the letters written to him by the people."
    After conducting propaganda, the farmers in the suburbs understood that their status and rights were very different from before. They all felt that they should actively produce and build a new China. The farmers felt that special agents and traitors should be severely punished. Some farmers in Ma Liupu in the Fourteenth District said: "After the Liberation Army came, the poor people were saved, but don't be too lenient with the bad guys."

　　各界代表会决议
　  深入工农群众
    一致表示要努力提高生产要求政府严惩不悔罪特务
    【本市讯】平市各厂区工人在北平市各界代表会议结束后，普遍学习了大会的各种决议和报告，一般工人都认为应做到发展生产、提高品质和节省原料的要求。造胰业工人提出应联合建立化验机构，定出成品标准，防止粗制滥造，使品质提高。大家对奸商的认识也更明确了。长城印刷厂工人王琦说：“我们一定要取缔投机奸商，我们不仅要搞好政治，还要搞好经济。”工人们认为对特务分子的处置过去过于宽大，对怙恶不悛分子应该坚决镇压。华北电业公司修理班工人余海亭说：“政府一再给特务坦白机会，他们还是执迷不悟，对于他们不能再行宽大，这种宽大造成他们的侥幸心理，以为晚坦白几天，也没有关系，甚至没人追问就可以不坦白了，对付这种人，应该坚决镇压。”参加平市各界代表会议的厚生火柴厂女工赵玉香，把看到毛主席的事给工人说了以后，就有工人说：“咱一定要好好干，争得劳动英雄，见见毛主席。”工人们对毛主席把一封隐名的信拿到会上去讨论，都很感动，工人们说：“毛主席真民主，尊重老百姓，人民真翻身做主人了。”听说参加平市各界代表会议的工人代表那样多，确实感到自己的政治地位提高了，有些学习不积极的工人就说：“咱们可不能再缺课了，不学习那能当家作主。”
    【本报讯】平市各界代表大会结束后，各郊区先后召集干部及各村农民代表进行传达。除了传达大会的决议、收获及彭真同志和叶市长的报告外；并结合布置了秋收种麦、精简节约等工作。之后，干部及农民代表即分头下乡，召开以村为单位的群众大会及各种类型的座谈会。如十五区妇女代表张振英回村后，召集了一千人的群众大会，述说对大会的感想。她以生动的讲话，启发了群众的认识。十九区并组织学生下乡宣传。
    经过这次普遍的宣传，各村代表及郊区一般农民对大会精神都有了基本的认识：十五区农民代表听了干部传达毛主席的讲话后，高兴极了，他们说：“现在真是翻了身，在过去见一个国民党的小官比登天还难！”十九区代表说：“毛主席真伟大，老百姓给他写信，还这样看重。”
    在进行宣传后，郊区农民都更懂得自己的地位与权利和以前大不相同了。他们都感到应该积极生产，建设新中国。农民觉得特务汉奸应该严办，十四区马六铺一些农民说：“解放军来了后，穷人得了救，但对坏人可不要太宽大了。”
