　　Harvesting Record
    ——A Record of a Certain Unit Helping the Masses with the Autumn Harvest
    Song Jie
    In recent days, the crops in the fields have ripened, the millet drooping its golden heads, and the corn growing strong and sturdy. Some soldiers returning from sentry duty would mutter, "We should help the villagers with the autumn harvest, otherwise, if a wind or rain comes, it will be a waste, and those families with a shortage of labor will be desperate?"
    On the evening of September 6th, dark clouds suddenly gathered in the sky, and a heavy rain started in an instant, the sound of the rain striking the leaves was deafening. When the rain stopped, a strong wind blew again in the night, continuing to blow the next morning, as if it would blow all the millet out of the fields, the ground was covered with golden grains. The millet that was about to be harvested was about to be snatched away by this strong wind, and the villagers were also anxious.
    A soldier saw this situation and reported it to the company headquarters. The company headquarters immediately sent people to contact the local government to find out how many people were needed and which families should be helped first. Then, in addition to those on duty, they mobilized more than twenty soldiers from the entire company to assist in the autumn harvest.
    The soldiers were overjoyed to hear that they were going to help the villagers harvest millet. At that time, the third squad challenged the first squad to see who could harvest the fastest and best, and guaranteed not to drop any ears of grain, and even deliver them to the families whose homes were far away and had no carts.
    When they arrived in the fields and saw the millet that had been blown to the ground by the wind, everyone felt it was a great pity. First Platoon Leader Li Lai-shuan shouted out first: "Comrades, hurry up and work, don't let the people's property suffer losses!" After he finished speaking, he took off his clothes and worked bare-chested in the strong wind. Other comrades also worked hard.
    At first, the villagers were worried that this group of People's Liberation Army soldiers who were helping with the autumn harvest would not be able to do it. But after working for a while, they saw that they were harvesting faster and better than they themselves, and even picked up the dropped ears of grain. Smiles appeared on the corners of their mouths, and they shouted to their little daughter:
    "Go, tell your mother to boil a pot of water!"
    From morning until noon, some comrades had blisters on their hands, and some comrades had their legs chafed, but they still did not rest, sweat flowed down their faces, dripping onto the grains, and cheerful laughter spread everywhere.
    On the left, there was a piece of land that was very low, and because it had rained the day before, the water had accumulated to a depth of one foot. The villagers said with some embarrassment: "Comrades, the water is too cold, don't go down!" The soldiers didn't say a word, rolled up their trouser legs, took off their shoes, and went down with their sickles, saying to the villagers as they harvested:
    "It doesn't matter! It doesn't matter!"
    They worked all day, and twenty-odd people harvested twenty-two mu of land. After they finished harvesting, they carried it to the villagers' homes. Some old women took out cigarettes and pears and asked the soldiers to eat them. When the soldiers refused to eat, they stubbornly stuffed them into their pockets. The soldiers took them out, and the old women got angry, saying:
    "These are things from our own home, they are not worth much, just to show our appreciation. You have worked all day and haven't even drunk our water, we really feel bad!"
    The soldiers explained to them:
    "The People's Liberation Army is the army of the people, we all grew up from the soil, working for you is the same as working for ourselves, the army and the people are one family."
    The old man smiled, puffing on his pipe, and interjected:
    "You are really a good army. At first, I doubted whether the Communist army, being soldiers, could be much better?
    Later, more than a dozen soldiers lived in my house, and they were very kind. In the morning, they swept the yard and carried water, and in the evening, they helped with grinding grain. I realized that you are different from the Kuomintang army. This time, you helped me harvest these grains, and I realize the benefits of the People's Liberation Army even more!
    Last year, the 'disaster army' (referring to the Kuomintang Central Army) lived not far from here. When the autumn harvest was approaching, they didn't care whether the people had work to do at home or not, they forcibly dragged them to work for them. I am old and can't walk fast. Once, when I went up the mountain to deliver food, because I walked a little slow, a 'disaster army' forcefully slapped me in the face, knocking my teeth loose. They took the corn and cooked it to eat as they pleased, and cut the sorghum and millet to feed the horses. Now it's good, with you here to stand up for us, no one dares to bully us, and you also help us with our work, it is truly the happiness of the people!".

　　割谷记
    ——记某部帮助群众秋收
    宋婕
    近几天来地里的庄稼都熟了，谷子黄黄的垂着头，苞米也长得很壮实。有的战士放哨回来就念叨着：“应该帮助老乡秋收了，要不刮个风下个雨的，就得糟蹋好些，在劳动力缺乏的人家，还不急死？”
    九月六日晚上，天上忽然起了乌黑的浓云，霎时间下起雨来，打得树叶哗哗地响。雨止了，夜里又刮起了大风，天明后还不停的刮着，仿佛要把地里的谷子刮光了似的，地里满是金黄色的谷粒。到了嘴的谷子，眼看要被这一场大风给抢去，老乡们也发了急。
    一个战士看到了这个情形，就回连部里报告，连部里马上派人和当地政府联络，了解一下需要多少人，先帮助那几家，然后，除了担负任务的以外动员了全连二十几个战士协助秋收。
    战士们听见要帮助老乡去割谷子了，高兴的不得了。当时，三班就和一班提出挑战，看谁割得最快，最好，并保证不掉谷穗，路远没车的还要送到家里。
    到了地里，看见地面上被风刮下的谷子，大家都觉得太可惜了，一排长李来拴首先喊了起来：“同志们，快点干，不要叫人民的财产受了损失！”他说完了，就把衣服脱下来，在大风中光着膀子干了起来，其他同志也都加油割着。
    老乡们起初对这一群帮助秋收的人民解放军，还怕干不了，及至干了一会，看见比他们自己割得还快，还好，并且把掉了的穗子也捡了起来，嘴角上就露出了笑意，嚷着他的小闺女：
    “去，叫你妈妈给烧一锅开水！”
    从早晨直割到晌午，有的同志手上磨了泡，有的同志腿被擦破了，但是他们还不休息，汗顺着脸流了下来，滴到谷粒上，愉快的笑声，四处飘扬。
    在左边，有一片地，很低，又因为昨天下了雨，积水有一尺来深，老乡很难为情似的说：“同志，水太凉，别下去了吧！”战士们没啃气，卷了卷裤腿，脱下鞋子，拿看镰刀就下去了，一面割着，一面和老乡说：
    “不要紧！不要紧！”
    一直干了一天，二十来个人割了二十二亩地，割完了，又往老乡家里背。有的老大娘拿了烟卷、梨子，叫战士吃，战士不吃，就楞往口袋里塞，战士们掏了出来，老大娘生气了，说：
    “这是咱家里的东西，不值钱，只表表咱的心意罢了，你们干了一天，连水都不喝我们的，叫我们真过意不去！”
    战士们就给他解释：
    “解放军是人民的军队，都是从土里生土里长的，给你们干活，跟给俺自己干活一样，军民是一家人。”
    老大爷笑着叨着烟袋，也插嘴说：
    “你们真是好队伍，在起初我还怀疑，共产党的军队也是当兵的，究竟能好多少？
    后来，我家里住了十几个队伍（战士），可和气着哪，早晨给扫院子，担水，晚上还帮着推磨，我就觉出你们和国民党军队不一样。这次你们又帮我割了这些谷子，我越发认识到解放军的好处了！
    去年，遭秧军（指国民党中央军）住在这里不远，快大秋了，也不管老百姓家里有活没活，硬抓了去给他们作工。我老了，走不动，有一次上山去送饭，走得慢一点，一个遭秧军使劲的打了我一个嘴巴，把我的牙都打得活摇了。玉米随便拿去煮了吃，高粱、谷子的割了去就喂马。现在可好了，有了你们在这里给我们作主，没人敢来欺侮我们，又帮我们干活，真是人民的幸福啊！”。
