　　Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 25th: Dentsu Tokyo dispatch: A US military court today sentenced an editor of the Japan United Press to two years of hard labor for publishing dispatches from foreign news agencies that "absurdly and maliciously criticize the occupying power and have the color of developing a specific propaganda policy." The left-wing United Press editor, Shichiro Morioka, was accused of violating news regulations by sending the following three messages. The three messages were: First, Dentsu quoted a statement from a Malayan trade union leader protesting the news of the May 4th execution of Ganapathy, chairman of the Malayan General Federation of Trade Unions. Second, a TASS New York dispatch of the 28th reported on the Civil Rights Congress' statement protesting the trial of Communist leaders and the state of domestic civil liberties in the United States. Third, a Xinhua News Agency dispatch of July 6th reported on a speech by Chinese writer and historian Guo Moruo criticizing US policy toward Japan. The court's verdict stated that from now on, no Japanese editor can safely report such foreign news.

　　美驻日占领者压迫进步舆论
    【新华社北平二十五日电】电通社东京讯：美军事法庭今日判处日本联合通讯社的编者以两年苦役，因为他发表了外国通讯社“荒谬而恶意地批评占领国，并有发展特殊宣传方针的色彩的电讯”。左翼联合通讯社的编辑森冈七郎因发出下面三条消息，被控有违犯新闻法规的罪名。这三条消息是：一，电通社引马来亚工会领袖的声明，抗议五月四日绞杀马来亚总工会主席加纳帕西的消息。二，塔斯社纽约二十八日消息，报道民权大会关于抗议审讯共产党领袖和美国的国内公民自由情况的声明。三，新华社七月六日电报道中国作家和历史学家郭沫若批评美国对日政策的演说。法庭判决书说明了：今后日本的编者谁都不能泰然报道这类外国的消息。
