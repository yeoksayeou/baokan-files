Concerning my request some time ago in the People's Daily to inquire about Yuqiang's whereabouts, I have just received a letter from Comrade Wu Kebin of the Fuyang Sub-district Military and Political Cadre School in northern Anhui, with the shocking news that Yuqiang died in the line of duty in the Third Sub-district Military Region of the Henan-Anhui Border Region. The letter also stated that you took your grandson to Kaifeng and then Zhengzhou last autumn, which is extremely painful. I am urgently seeking you and your son. Please provide your current address so that our family can be reunited, allowing the deceased to rest in peace and the living to have someone to rely on. After seeing this notice, please quickly write down your current address and send the letter to No. 82, Jiqing Zongli, Zhongshan Avenue, Hankou, to my residence. I am anxiously waiting.

　　湖北鄂城县柯愈强遗妻陆彦芬（或名彦芳）览
    月前托登人民日报查询愈强下落，顷得皖北阜阳分区军政干校吴克彬同志函，惊悉愈强已于豫皖边区三分区军次殉职。并说明汝于去秋携同孙儿赴开封转郑州云云至为惨痛。余急待寻觅汝母子，现在住处，期于骨肉团聚，俾死者无遗恨，生者有依归望汝于见报后速将现在住址写明，信寄汉口中山大道积庆总里八十二号本寓，念切盼切。
