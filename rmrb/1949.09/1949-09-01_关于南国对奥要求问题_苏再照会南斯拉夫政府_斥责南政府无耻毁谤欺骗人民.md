Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 31st: TASS, Moscow, August 30th: The Soviet Union's note to the Yugoslav government.

On August 20th, the Yugoslav government delivered a note to the Soviet government in response to the Soviet government's note of August 11th regarding the Soviet Union's attitude towards Yugoslavia concerning the proposed demands on Austria in the draft Austrian treaty.

In its note of August 29th, the Soviet government informed the Yugoslav government of the Soviet Union's response as follows:

The Soviet government has received the Yugoslav government's note of August 20th. The Yugoslav government's new note is a combination of new deceptions and slanderous fabrications, intended to cover up its double-dealing policy and deceive the Yugoslav people. Because the undeniable facts presented in the Soviet government's note of August 11th prove that the Yugoslav government has betrayed the interests of the Carinthian Slovenes and the national interests of Yugoslavia, the Yugoslav government is trying to cover up the traces of its treachery and evade responsibility with its usual tricks of fabrication and slander. The Soviet government considers it necessary to make the following statement, not to persuade the Yugoslav government, because the Yugoslav government has long been unrepentant and completely obeys the orders of its Western masters, but to expose it and help the Yugoslav people understand the true face of the current Yugoslav government. The Soviet government declares as follows:

(1)

The Yugoslav government insists that Stalin, in his letter to Austrian Chancellor Renner, "made assurances regarding the 1938 borders of Austria" (see Yugoslav note of August 3rd), saying that Stalin "promised that the Austrian borders would remain unchanged," Stalin has "promised to maintain the Austrian-Yugoslav border unchanged with all kinds of assistance," and that in view of this, the Soviet government cannot agree to Yugoslavia's demand to transfer Slovene Carinthia to the Yugoslav Republic.

We now quote Stalin's letter to Austrian Chancellor Renner in May 1945 as follows:

"To His Excellency Mr. Renner, State Chancellor of Austria:

Dear friend, I am deeply grateful for your letter of April 15th.

You can rest assured that your concern for the independence, territorial integrity and welfare of Austria is also my concern. I will do my best to provide Austria with any assistance it may need.

Please excuse the delay in replying.

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Joseph Stalin"

As can be seen in Stalin's letter, there is not a single word mentioning "the borders of Austria," nor mentioning "guaranteeing the 1938 borders of Austria," or "the immutability of the Austrian borders," or "the Austrian borders will remain unchanged." All of this is fabrication and lies by the Yugoslav government.

Stalin's letter was prompted by two situations, namely the threat of Austria's division and loss of independence. On the one hand, some people in Britain were plotting to merge Austria, Hungary, and part of Southern Germany into a Danubian kingdom. The Soviet government strongly opposed this plan, declaring that such measures would endanger Austria's independence and that Austria must remain an independent country. On the other hand, some nationalists in Slavic countries—including Yugoslavia—planned to divide Austria among its neighboring countries. The Soviet government also firmly opposed this, declaring that dividing Austria was a reactionary measure that violated democratic principles and that Austria must remain a country with territorial integrity.

Stalin's letter was based on this.

The Yugoslav government believes that the principle of national self-determination only applies to Yugoslavia and the victorious nations. However, only those who have grown up in the spirit of imperialist conquest can think this way. On the contrary, democracy proceeds from the fact that the principle of national self-determination must be applied to all nations, including the conquered nations. The Soviet government proceeded from this point when opposing the plan to establish a Danubian kingdom and the plan to divide Austria.

Does this mean that the Soviet government's opposition to the division of Austria and its support for its independence is an acknowledgement of the "immutability of Austria's borders," and that it does not allow Austria's borders to be modified in favor of Yugoslavia? No, absolutely not. Absolutely not. The issue of the territorial integrity of one country or another is completely different from the issue of the "immutability of the borders" of that country. Only those who have lost the last trace of Marxism can confuse them and equate them. The Soviet government opposed the division of Poland and supported the unification of all Polish lands into a unified and territorially integral country. Does this mean that the Soviet Union also supported the immutability of Poland's borders and therefore did not consider any modifications of the Polish borders in one way or another to be possible? No, that is not what it meant at all. Later facts have clearly demonstrated this.

When some politicians in the United States were brewing a plan to partially partition Italy and demanded that Sicily be separated from Italy, the Soviet government opposed this plan and insisted on Italy's territorial integrity. Does this mean that the Soviet government supported the immutability of Italy's borders and considered it impossible to modify the Italian borders in favor of Yugoslavia? Absolutely not. Later facts have clearly demonstrated this. The same should be said about Austria. The Soviet government has advocated in the past, and continues to uphold, the integrity of Austria. Does this mean that the Soviet Union supports the immutability of Austria's borders and that the Soviet Union does not consider it possible to modify the Austrian borders in favor of Yugoslavia? Obviously, that is not what it means. Later facts have clearly demonstrated this, because while maintaining Austria's integrity, the Soviet Union simultaneously supported the need to modify Austria's borders in favor of Yugoslavia.

There is no doubt that if the Yugoslav government had not become cowardly, and if it had not betrayed Yugoslavia's national rights out of cowardice, Yugoslavia would have already obtained Slovene Carinthia.

(2)

The Yugoslav government knows that its malicious fabrication regarding Stalin's letter to Renner is unfounded, and therefore adopts another slanderous fiction. It asserts in its note that the Soviet government no longer considers it possible to support Yugoslavia's old demands regarding Slovene Carinthia, which the Yugoslav government has already abandoned, and insists that this is because the Soviet government received an extra $50 million when it sold Soviet property in Austria to the Austrian government. It is well known that, according to the Potsdam Conference, the Soviet Union obtained the right to possess German property in eastern Austria, just as Britain, the United States, and France obtained German property in western Austria, Western Europe, and the Americas. In order to accommodate Austria, the Soviet government agreed to sell a portion of this property to Austria for appropriate compensation. And now the Yugoslav government believes that "the Soviet government, by agreeing that Slovene Carinthia should remain under Austrian jurisdiction, has therefore increased the compensation for German property in Austria by $50 million," and that for this reason, the Soviet government is entitled to $150 million for the aforementioned property, instead of the $100 million it previously requested.

We never imagined that the Yugoslav government could sink so low as to imagine the Soviet Union in such a vile and filthy way. There is no doubt that only those who have betrayed socialism and democracy and have become rabid fascists can talk about the Soviet Union and its government in such a brazen and unreasonable manner.

In the Yugoslav government's sophistry, every word is a lie. Saying that the Soviet government demanded $100 million in compensation for the property (referring to Soviet property in Austria – translator), that is nonsense. In fact, the Soviet government demanded $200 million. Saying that the Soviet government received $50 million more than the price, that is nonsense. In fact, the Soviet government received $50 million less than the price. Saying that the Carinthia issue has anything to do with the sale of Soviet property in Austria, that is nonsense, because even according to the Yugoslav government's filthy assumptions, the issue of Slovene Carinthia is not even relevant. All of this is fabrication and nonsense by the Yugoslav government.

No, gentlemen! It is not the Soviet government that has betrayed the interests of the Carinthian Slovenes, but the Yugoslav government, which abandoned all territorial claims against Austria as early as 1947. Here is the document: a letter from Kardelj to Vyshinsky on April 20, 1947, in which the Yugoslav government abandoned Slovene Carinthia and limited itself to obtaining special rights in the management institutions of two power stations. The document states: "The problem can be resolved by slightly modifying the border. For this purpose, I submit to you a draft of two plans, which can ultimately be resolved by establishing the special rights of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia in the management institutions of these power stations."

The Yugoslav government cannot evade this treacherous document with excuses, just as it cannot evade its own shadow.

It is worth noting the fact that simultaneously with the Yugoslav government's abandonment of Slovene Carinthia in Kardelj's letter, the Soviet delegation attending the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference declared on April 21, 1947, the day after receiving Kardelj's letter: "The Soviet delegation believes that the Yugoslav government's proposals, as stated in the memorandum submitted by the Yugoslav delegation to the London Foreign Ministers' Assistants' Conference on January 22, 1947, regarding the merger of Slovene Carinthia with a part of Slavonia in Yugoslavia, and regarding the Slovene border region of Styria, and regarding the provision of special laws for the Croats of Burgenland (located in southeastern Austria, bordering southern Hungary) to protect their national rights, are well-founded. The Soviet delegation supports the above-mentioned proposals." As is well known, this statement by the Soviet delegation was later included in the report of the Council of Foreign Ministers to the Austrian Peace Treaty Committee in October 1947.

There is another document. In its note of August 3, 1949, the Yugoslav government claimed: "As early as April 20, 1947, the Soviet Union was notified of the Yugoslav government's proposals (which were submitted to British Minister Noel-Baker on June 14, 1947) in a letter to Minister Vyshinsky." The letter to Minister Vyshinsky is the aforementioned letter from Kardelj.

Therefore, the Yugoslav government admits in its August 3rd note that the British government was notified by the Yugoslav government in June 1947 that Yugoslavia was abandoning all territorial claims to Austria concerning Slovene Carinthia. Not only the British government, but also the United States and France, which followed a common negative policy on Yugoslavia's demands on Austria, were notified that the Yugoslav government, apart from formally retaining its formal statement of territorial claims on Slovene Carinthia in the Foreign Ministers' Conference for the sake of appearances, had in fact abandoned these demands, betraying the interests of the Carinthian Slovenes and the national rights of Yugoslavia.

From this, the falsity of the Yugoslav government's statement in its August 20th note is very obvious, in which the Yugoslav government stated: "Everyone knows that the Yugoslav government has never abandoned and has never stopped fighting for the reunification of Slovene Carinthia..."

The Yugoslav government's hypocrisy and double-dealing are made even more obvious by the fact that the aforementioned discussions with British ministers were kept secret from the Soviet government and held behind the Soviet Union's back. Everyone knows that Kardelj's letter of April 12th did not mention in the slightest that the Yugoslav government intended to notify Britain of its concessions regarding the issue of Slovene Carinthia. The Soviet government had no knowledge of the discussions until they were inadvertently revealed in July 1947 during a conversation between one of Yugoslavia's representatives in Vienna and the Soviet Union's deputy political advisor in Austria. Only after this did the Soviet government, through its ambassador in Belgrade, request the Yugoslav government to explain this matter. On August 5, 1947, Soviet Ambassador Lavrentiev met with Prime Minister Tito and Deputy Prime Minister Kardelj. The Soviet Ambassador requested that the Soviet government be informed of the situation of the Belgrade discussions with Noel-Baker. To this request, Tito initially claimed that in these discussions, the Yugoslav government had insisted on its formal proposals regarding Slovene Carinthia, which had been submitted to the Foreign Ministers' Conference, but this was immediately corrected by Kardelj, who admitted that Noel-Baker had also been notified of the minimum territorial demands for Slovene Carinthia.

However, it was only from the Yugoslav government's note of August 3, 1949, that it became clear that British Minister Noel-Baker had been notified of the Yugoslav government's proposals presented in Kardelj's letter of April 20, 1947, which included the Yugoslav government's abandonment of all territorial claims to Slovene Carinthia.

These facts first prove that the Yugoslav government notified the British government of its abandonment of territorial claims to Slovene Carinthia as early as the summer of 1947, but concealed it from the Soviet Union. Secondly, these facts prove that the Yugoslav government engaged in double-dealing in 1947 and later, pretending to be a fighter for Slovene Carinthia, although, in fact, the Yugoslav government had abandoned Slovene Carinthia two years earlier in secret talks with the British government delegation.

Third, these facts prove that since the Western countries learned that Yugoslavia had abandoned Slovene Carinthia, they could not but oppose Yugoslavia's territorial claims even more sharply, making it impossible for the Soviet Union to achieve success in supporting Yugoslavia's demands.

What is the reason for this betrayal of Slovene Carinthia by the Yugoslav government? What is the reason for this despicable double-dealing with the Soviet Union? What is the purpose it pursues?

Obviously, this is to cunningly incite divisions at the Foreign Ministers' Conference. The Yugoslav government did this for the benefit of the extreme and most aggressive imperialist groups in Britain, the United States, and France, which are conducive to maintaining anti-Soviet sentiment and war hysteria.

In this matter, the Yugoslav government acted like an opponent and enemy of the Soviet Union, like an agent of the imperialist groups.

When this ambiguous trick played by the Yugoslav government was clearly exposed, the Soviet government naturally refused to participate in the despicable policy of deceiving the Yugoslav people followed by the Yugoslav government.

It is also understandable that the Soviet government can no longer defend Yugoslavia's territorial claims, because it has now become clear that the Yugoslav government itself had abandoned these claims in secret talks with the British government delegation in 1947, thus making it impossible for the Soviet government to continue to support Yugoslavia's demands.

(3)

The Yugoslav government, feeling hopeless about its surrender stance on the Slovene Carinthia issue and seeing that it could not hide Kardelj's letter regarding the Yugoslav government's declaration of abandonment of Slovene Carinthia from public opinion, resorted to a third slanderous fabrication. It insisted that the Soviet delegation forced the Yugoslav government to discuss Yugoslavia's territorial claims on Austria with the Western countries, and said that the Yugoslav government was "willing to make concessions on this issue purely because the Soviet Union had made such a request."

In fact, the Soviet representatives exposed this lying nonsense of the Yugoslav government in statements at the Four-Power Conferences in Moscow, Vienna, and London in 1947, 1948, and 1949, where they openly and faithfully defended all of Yugoslavia's territorial and other demands on Austria. However, the Yugoslav government tried to evade these facts and preferred to engage in futile chatter.

In fact, the Soviet government exposed this lying nonsense of the Yugoslav government, reminding the Yugoslav government in its August 11th note that in November 1947, the Soviet Ambassador to Yugoslavia had told the Yugoslav Foreign Minister, in response to the latter's inquiry, that the Soviet Union believed that there was no basis for Yugoslavia to lower its territorial demands on Austria. However, the Yugoslav government evaded this fact and pretended not to notice it.

In fact, the Soviet government exposed this lying nonsense of the Yugoslav government, reminding the Yugoslav government in its August 11th note that in 1948, the Soviet Ambassador to Yugoslavia had reiterated the Soviet government's position on the inappropriateness of Yugoslavia lowering its territorial demands, and at the same time exposed Bebler's highly suspicious behavior in London. But this time the Yugoslav government also evaded this fact, pretending to be blind and ignorant. If all these facts do not show that the Yugoslav government is maliciously slandering the Soviet Union and its representatives, insisting that they have been forcing the Yugoslav government to abandon Yugoslavia's territorial demands, and that the Yugoslav government was "prepared to make territorial concessions because the Soviet government made such a request" – if all the above facts do not show these things, then what do they show?

The question arises: if the Soviet government had forced the Yugoslav government to make territorial concessions, then why did it not make full use of Kardelj's letter and agree to the Yugoslav government's proposals in this letter regarding the complete or partial abandonment of Yugoslavia's territorial demands? How is this explained?

Indeed, if the Soviet government had forced the Yugoslav government to make territorial concessions, then why did it not agree to Kardelj's letter? Why did it reject Kardelj's proposals? Did the Yugoslav government think about this?

Simply raising this question is enough to shatter all the slanderous fabrications of the Yugoslav government insisting that the Soviet government has stubbornly induced it to abandon Yugoslavia's territorial demands. Has the Yugoslav government not realized this?

Is it generally permissible to abandon maximum territorial demands? In the above situation, is it permissible to replace maximum demands with minimum demands? Yes, it is permissible, but with two conditions: that is, if it is out of necessity, that is, if there is no hope of realizing the maximum demands within a certain period of time, and that the Yugoslav government is responsible for such concessions. So, why did the Soviet government not agree to Kardelj's proposals? First, because the concessions proposed by Kardelj were not out of necessity, that is to say, there was a possibility of realizing the maximum territorial demands. Second, because Yugoslavia refused to be responsible for the concessions proposed in Kardelj's letter. The Yugoslav government was eager to have the Soviet Union responsible for these concessions instead of itself. The Soviet government certainly could not endorse this treacherous conspiracy to deceive the Yugoslav people.

The Yugoslav government attempts to present the matter in such a way that, on the surface, it seems that the reason why Kardelj wrote to Vyshinsky was because the Soviet representatives had attempted to obtain a compromise solution to the Slovene Carinthia issue, and therefore Kardelj's letter was a response to Vyshinsky's proposal. However, there is no hint in Kardelj's letter that this letter is a response to any proposal, let alone that this letter is a response to the request of the Soviet representatives. On the contrary, Kardelj's letter undoubtedly was not written for some "request" from the Soviet representatives, but out of Kardelj's own initiative. This can be seen from the first sentence of Kardelj's letter: "Because there is a possibility of completely abandoning Yugoslavia's territorial demands on Austria in their current form, and if you are willing to make new proposals, I would like to draw your attention to these issues, which are so important to the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia that it is necessary to seek a positive solution."

From this we can see that Kardelj's letter is not a response to any proposals or requests from Vyshinsky. If Kardelj's letter was responding to Vyshinsky's proposals or requests, it would have been written like this: "Because ("because" is emphasized – original note) you are willing to make new proposals" or "In view of the fact that you are willing to make new proposals." However, the letter states certain completely different facts, namely: "If ("if" is emphasized – original note) you are willing to make new proposals." Therefore, Kardelj's letter is not a response to any proposals or requests from Vyshinsky, but rather poses a question to Vyshinsky: Are you willing to make new proposals? Everyone knows that the Soviet government negatively answered Kardelj's question. The Soviet government stated that it had no intention of proposing modifications to Yugoslavia's demands on Slovene Carinthia. The Soviet government replied that the modification of Yugoslavia's demands was not out of necessity, and that if the Yugoslav government insisted on its position, then it must bear full responsibility for the territorial demands, and only if the Yugoslav government bears full responsibility for such concessions would the Soviet government be prepared to maintain this new position in the Foreign Ministers' Conference as Yugoslavia's position.

Everyone knows that the Yugoslav government wants to shift the responsibility for territorial concessions onto the Soviet government. It refuses to be responsible for these concessions and wants to conceal its new surrender stance from the Yugoslav people.

For the sake of clarity, let us still quote the original text of Kardelj's letter regarding the Yugoslav government's abandonment of its territorial demands:

"To Moscow. April 20, 1947.

Comrade Vyshinsky:

Because there is a possibility of completely abandoning Yugoslavia's territorial demands on Austria in their current form, and if you are willing to make new proposals, I would like to draw your attention to these issues, which are so important to the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia that it is necessary to seek a positive solution. A positive solution to these issues is the minimum satisfaction of Yugoslavia's territorial demands.

The first issue is about the Gvauberk and Lavamünd power stations. In my report to the Council of Ministers, I emphasized the special importance of these power stations to Yugoslavia's electrical industry. The Gvauberk and Lavamünd power stations were built by the Vienna German Electric Power Factory Corporation after the German-Austrian merger, mainly during the war, disregarding the 1926 convention (in which Austria had guaranteed not to build anything on the Drava River without Yugoslavia's prior consent). Therefore, these power stations are German assets in the western region of Austria from which the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia, as well as other countries that signed the resolutions of the Paris Reparations Conference, should also extract a portion of reparations. Not only that, the construction of these power stations did not take into account the needs of Yugoslavia's electrical industry, and under the current operating system, they cause huge losses – nearly one million kilowatt-hours in some months. The problem can be resolved by slightly modifying the border. For this purpose, I submit to you a draft of two plans, which can ultimately be resolved by establishing the special rights of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia in the management institutions of these power stations. Attached is a plan for this system.

The second issue is about the special protection of the national rights of the Carinthian Slovenes. In view of the historical experience of the Slovenes with Austria, it can be determined that after the treaty is signed, attempts to intensify Germanization will occur. After the collapse of Germany, Austria undertook in Carinthia – albeit only on paper – some appeasement measures aimed at showing its tolerance on national issues (such as rebuilding bilingual schools), but in fact even these measures have not been implemented to this day. Therefore, it would be of great importance if, in the treaty, we jointly agreed to increase the measures that have already become legally effective and to fully subject such measures to Four-Power control as an integral part of the treaty. Attached is a plan outlining the basic principles of this system. With kind regards. Kardelj

First Plan

The first plan includes the administrative district of Bleiburg (Pliberk), the area currently between the southern Austrian border, the Drava River and the western boundary of the two villages Bistrica (Feistritz) and Brato (Möchling), and the area north of the Drava River – the village Lavamünd (Lavamünde) and the adjacent village Ludmannsdorf (Ludmannsdorf) adjacent to the Drava River and separated from the rest of the village by the mountains along the 882-meter high peak. In this way, the area included is 210 square kilometers, with a population of 9,396 according to the 1934 Austrian census.

The ethnic composition of the area can be examined in detail according to the attached table. Although everyone knows that the Austrian census conducted in 1910 was unfavorable to the Slovenes, it also showed that the Slovenes accounted for a clear majority in this territory (6,696 Slovenes, 2,878 Germans).

In the 1920 plebiscite, the majority of the area voted for Yugoslavia.

Second Plan

The second plan includes the villages of Libelitz (Leifling) and Zweibach (Schwarbach) south of the Drava River, and a small part of the village of Lavamünd (Lavamünde) and Ludmannsdorf (Ludmannsdorf) north of the Drava River. This plan covers approximately 63 square kilometers and has a population of 3,150 according to the 1934 Austrian census.

The ethnic composition is slightly worse than in the first plan, because the village of Lavamünd (where most of the residents live according to this plan) has been heavily Germanized."

(4)

In its note of August 20th, the Yugoslav government requested the Soviet government to show special respect and even love for the Yugoslav government, and to express such respect and love in the Soviet note to the Yugoslav government; and that the note should not contain anything that might hurt the Yugoslav government's self-esteem or offend such self-esteem. The Yugoslav government claims that this is necessary according to "international rules."

The Soviet government has to state that what the Yugoslav government is asking of the Soviet government is impossible.

As is well known, the Yugoslav government has abandoned the socialist and democratic camp and sided with the imperialist and fascist camp.

It must be pointed out that the Soviet people and the Soviet public have no respect for traitors. They especially cannot express love for traitors. Not only that, as is well known, the Soviet people and the Soviet public despise traitors.

Of course, there are all kinds of traitors. There are traitors who seek good fortune, who betray out of cowardice and want to save their lives. There are also other traitors, malicious traitors. These are the kind of people who betray not only to save their lives, but also to harm the camp they have betrayed. No matter how sad it is, it must be stated that the Soviet people and the Soviet public classify the Yugoslav government not as a fortune-seeking traitor, but as a malicious traitor.

It must be further pointed out that malicious traitors are also of various kinds. Some are the kind of malicious traitors who feel guilty, are pained by their shame, try to make themselves inconspicuous and hide, and behave almost with self-deprecation. But there are also some malicious traitors who profit from their shamelessness, loudly embellish their betrayal as an act of heroism, jump out like puppets on a stage to denigrate the camp they have betrayed, and shamelessly boast that they can often bark at this camp, and therefore, they are not some simple traitor, but a hero. Just as Krylov's fable says, the puppy barks at the elephant and always thinks it is great.

No matter how sad it is, it must be stated that the Soviet people and the Soviet public precisely classify Yugoslavia as this kind of self-promoting malicious traitor.

This is the opinion of the public, and the Soviet government will naturally act accordingly.

We hope the Yugoslav government will recognize that it should not expect any courtesy from the Soviet government, let alone respect.

　　关于南国对奥要求问题  苏再照会南斯拉夫政府
  　斥责南政府无耻毁谤欺骗人民
    【新华社北平三十一日电】塔斯社莫斯科三十日电：苏联给南斯拉夫政府的照会。
    八月二十日，南斯拉夫政府交给苏联政府照会一件，答复苏联政府八月十一日关于苏联对南斯拉夫就奥地利和约草案的讨论所提对奥要求之态度的照会复文。
    苏联政府在八月二十九日的照会中，通知南斯拉夫政府关于苏联的答复如下：
    苏联政府业已收到南斯拉夫政府八月二十日的照会。南斯拉夫政府的新照会乃是新的欺骗与毁谤性捏造的结合，其用意在于掩盖其两面政策和欺骗南斯拉夫人民。由于苏联政府八月十一日照会中所提出的无可否认的事实证明了南斯拉夫政府出卖加林西亚斯洛文族的利益和南斯拉夫的民族利益，南斯拉夫政府正在试图以其捏造和诽谤的惯技，来掩盖其背信弃义的痕迹和规避责任。苏联政府认为有作下述声明的必要，这不是为了说服南斯拉夫政府，因为南斯拉夫政府早就不知悔悟，而完全唯其西方主子之命是听的政府，而是为了揭穿它，并帮助南斯拉夫人民认识南斯拉夫现政府的真面目。苏联政府声明如下：
    （一）
    南斯拉夫政府坚持，斯大林在其给奥地利总理伦纳的信中，“提出关于一九三八年奥地利疆界”的保证（见南斯拉夫八月三日照会）说，斯大林“答应奥国疆界不变”，斯大林业已“答应以种种援助来保持奥南疆界不变”，而且有鉴于此，苏联政府不能同意南斯拉夫的关于把斯洛文族加林西亚转让给南斯拉夫共和国的要求。
    我们现引证一九四五年五月斯大林致奥地利总理伦纳的信如下：
    “奥地利国务总理伦纳先生阁下：
    敬爱的朋友，我深深感谢你四月十五日的来信。
    你可以无须怀疑，你对奥地利之独立、领土完整与福利的关心，也就是我的关心。我将尽我的力量和可能，予奥地利以可能需要的任何援助。
    未即函复，谨致歉意。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　约瑟夫·斯大林”
    如象在斯大林的信中所看到的，既没有只字提到“奥地利的疆界”，也没有提到“保证一九三八年奥地利疆界”，或者是“奥地利疆界的不可变更性”，或者是“奥地利疆界将保持不变”。所有这一切，都是南斯拉夫政府的捏造与撒谎。
    斯大林的信是由两种情形所促起，那便是威胁着奥地利的分裂与丧失独立。一方面，英国某些人士阴谋计划合并奥、匈及南德的一部分成为多瑙河王国。苏联政府着重地反对这一计划，声明这种措施使奥地利有丧失独立的危险，奥地利必须保持为一独立的国家。另一方面，斯拉夫国家——包括南斯拉夫在内——的某些民族主义分子，计划把奥地利由各比邻国家瓜分。苏联政府也坚决反对这一点，声明瓜分奥地利乃是违反民主原则的反动措施，奥地利必须保持为一领土完整的国家。
    斯大林之所以写这封信，是以这一点为基础的。
    南斯拉夫政府认为，民族自决原则只适用于南斯拉夫和战胜的民族。但是，只有在帝国主义征服的精神中成长的人，才能作这种想法。相反地，民主主义则是从这种事实出发，即民族自决原则必须应用于一切民族，包括被征服的民族在内。苏联政府在反对建立多瑙河王国的计划以及瓜分奥地利的计划时，正是从这一点出发的。
    难道这就是说，苏联政府反对奥地利的分裂，赞成它的独立，就是承认奥地利“疆界的不可变更性”吗，就是承认不容许奥地利疆界作有利于南斯拉夫的修改吗？不是的，完全不是的。完全不是的。这一国家和那一国家的领土完整问题，与这一国家的“疆界的不可变更性”问题，完全是两个不同的问题。只有已经丧失了马克思主义的最后一点痕迹的人，才能把它们混为一谈，并在两者中间划一个等号。苏联政府反对分裂波兰，并赞成一切波兰人的土地统一为一个统一的领土完整的国家。难道这就能说是：因此苏联同时赞成波兰疆界的不可变更性，因此便不认为波兰疆界的这种或那种方式的修改是可能的吗？不，完全不是这个意思。后来的事实十分明显地证明了这一点。
    当美国的一部分政客酝酿部分地分割意大利的计划而要求西西里与意大利分离时，苏联政府就反对这一计划而坚主意大利的领土完整。难道这就是说，苏联政府赞同意大利疆界的不可变更性，认为将意大利疆界作有利于南斯拉夫的修改为不可能吗？绝不是如此。后来的事实十分明显地证明了这一点。关于奥国，也应该这样说。苏联政府过去主张，而且继续维护奥地利的完整性。难道这就是说，苏联赞同奥地利疆界的不可变动性，而且苏联并不认为将奥地利疆界作有利于南斯拉夫的修改是可能的吗？十分明显，绝不是这样的意思。后来的事实十分清楚的证明了这一点，因为苏联在维护奥地利的完整性的时候，同时支持对奥地利的疆界作有利于南斯拉夫的修改的必要性。
    无须怀疑，假如南斯拉夫政府不是变成怯懦，假如它不因为怯懦而出卖南斯拉夫的民族权利，南斯拉夫就会已经获得斯洛文族加林西亚了。
    （二）
    南斯拉夫政府知道自己关于斯大林致伦纳函件的恶意捏造毫无根据，因此采用另一个毁谤的虚构，它在其照会中断言苏联政府不再认为支持南斯拉夫政府所已放弃的南斯拉夫关于斯洛文族加林西亚的老要求是可能的，硬说这是因为苏联政府在把奥境苏联财产售与奥国政府时多得了五千万美元。世人皆知，按照波斯坦会议的决定，苏联取得了占有在东奥的德国财产的权利，一如英国、美国和法国取得了在西奥、西欧和美洲国家的德国财产一样。为迁就奥国起见，苏联政府同意将这种财产的一部分，以适当的补偿卖给奥地利。而现在南斯拉夫政府认为，“苏联政府由于同意斯洛文族加林西亚仍属奥国管辖，而因此在奥境德国财产的报偿上增加了五千万美元”，因为这个缘故，苏联政府不是如以前所要求的，对于上述财产有权得到一亿美元，而是一亿五千万美元。
    我们原来没有想到南斯拉夫政府能够堕落到如此之甚，以至于这样卑鄙龌龊地来设想苏联。毫无疑义，唯有叛卖社会主义与民主而且已经变为狂暴的法西斯分子的那些人，才能够这样厚颜无耻地和横蛮无理地信口谈论苏联及其政府。
    在南斯拉夫政府的诡辩中，每一个字都是谎话。说什么苏联政府要求给财产（指苏在奥财产—译者）以一万万美元的报偿，那是胡说八道。事实上，苏联政府要求二万万美元。说什么苏联政府超过定价多获得五千万美元，那是胡说八道。事实上，苏联政府是比定价少获得五千万美元。说加林西亚问题与奥境苏联财产的售卖有什么关系，那是胡说八道，因为即使以南斯拉夫政府的龌龊假定来说，也谈不上斯洛文族加林西亚的问题。这一切都是南斯拉夫政府的捏造和胡说八道。
    不是的，先生们！出卖了加林西亚斯洛文族的利益的，并不是苏联政府，而是南斯拉夫政府，后者远自一九四七年就放弃了对奥地利的一切领土要求。这里就有文件：一九四七年四月二十日卡德尔致维辛斯基的信其中南斯拉夫政府就放弃了斯洛文族加林西亚，并且自己只限于获得两个动力站管理机构中的特别权利就算了。这文件说：“问题可借对疆界略加修改而解决，为此目的，我向你提出两个方案的草案，最后并可由确立南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国在这些动力站管理机构中的特别权利而解决问题。”
    南斯拉夫政府不能借辞躲闪开这个叛逆性的文件，正如它不能躲闪开它自己的影子一样。
    值得注意的是这样一件事实：与南斯拉夫政府在卡德尔的信里放弃斯洛文族加林西亚同时，出席莫斯科外长会议的苏联代表团，在一九四七年四月二十一日，也就是接到卡德尔的信的次日，宣称：“苏联代表团认为：如南斯拉夫代表团对一九四七年一月二十二日伦敦外长助理会议所提出的备忘录中所述的那样，关于把斯洛文族加林西亚与南斯拉夫之一部分的斯拉窝尼亚合并，以及关于斯提里亚的斯洛文族边疆地区以及关于给布根兰（按在奥国东南，与匈南接壤）的克罗特族规定特别法令以保障其民族权利的这些南斯拉夫政府建议，是有充分根据的。苏联代表团支持上述的建议。”如所周知，苏联代表团这项声明后来已载于一九四七年十月间对奥和约委员会对外长会议的报告上。
    另外还有一个文件。南斯拉夫政府在其一九四九年八月三日照会中声称：“早在一九四七年四月二十日，即已经由致维辛斯基部长的一封信，将南斯拉夫政府的建议（而这一种建议于一九四七年六月十四日提交英国部长诺尔·贝克）通知了苏联。”致维辛斯基部长的信，就是上面提到的卡德尔的信件。
    因此，南斯拉夫政府在其八月三日照会中承认：英国政府在一九四七年六月就得到南斯拉夫政府通知，南国放弃对奥地利的有关斯洛文族加林西亚的一切领土要求。不仅英国政府，而且连对南斯拉夫对奥要求遵循共同的消极方针的美国和法国，也已经得到通知：南斯拉夫政府除了为面子关系，听任其关于斯洛文族加林西亚领土要求的形式上声明保留于外长会议中之外，事实上已放弃了这些要求，背叛了加林西亚斯洛文族的利益和南斯拉夫的民族权利。
    由此，南斯拉夫政府在八月二十日照会中的声明的虚伪性，就非常显而易见了，南斯拉夫政府在其照会中称：“大家都知道，南斯拉夫政府从未放弃且从未停止为团聚斯洛文族加林西亚而斗争…………”。
    南斯拉夫政府的虚伪性和两面手腕由下述事实而更加明显，即上面所讲到的与英国部长们的商谈，是对苏联政府保守秘密和在苏联背后举行的。大家知道，在四月十二日的卡德尔的信中，丝毫未提到南斯拉夫政府意欲以其关于斯洛文族加林西亚问题的让步通知英国。苏联政府一直到一九四七年七月在南斯拉夫驻维也纳代表之一与苏联驻奥地利副政治顾问谈话中无意中吐露出来之时为止，对商谈一直毫无所知。仅仅在这之后，苏联政府才经由其驻贝尔格莱德大使，要求南斯拉夫政府解释这件事情。一九四七年八月五日，苏大使拉夫伦捷夫曾与铁托总理及卡德尔副总理会议。苏大使请求把与诺尔·贝克贝尔格莱德商谈的情形，通知苏政府，对于这一请求，铁托最初声称，在这些商谈当中，南政府曾坚持其在外长会议中提出的关于斯洛文族加林西亚的正式建议，可是这立即为卡德尔所纠正，他承认诺尔·贝克也被通知了对斯洛文族加林西亚的最低限度领土要求。
    然而只有从南斯拉夫政府一九四九年八月三日的照会中才明白：英国的部长诺尔·贝克曾被通知以在卡德尔一九四七年四月二十日信件中提出的南政府建议，这些建议包括南政府放弃对斯洛文族加林西亚的一切领土要求。
    这些事实首先证明：南斯拉夫政府早在一九四七年夏季，便已通知了英国政府它放弃对斯洛文族加林西亚的领土要求，可是却向苏联隐瞒着。其次，这些事实证明：南斯拉夫政府在一九四七年以及后来，都曾从事两面的勾当，它假装是维护斯洛文族加林西亚的战士，虽然，事实上南斯拉夫政府两年前便已在和英国政府代表团的秘密会谈中放弃了斯洛文族加林西亚。
    第三、这些事实证明，西方国家既然获悉了南斯拉夫放弃斯洛文族加林西亚，便不能不甚至更尖锐地反对南斯拉夫的领土要求，这使得苏联在支持南斯拉夫的要求上，不可能获得成就。
    南斯拉夫政府对斯洛文族加林西亚的这种出卖行为的理由何在？对苏联的这种卑鄙的两面勾当的理由何在呢？它所追求的目的是什么呢？
    明显地，这是追求在外长会议上狡猾地煽动分歧的目的。南斯拉夫政府之所以这样做，是为了英、美、法极端的、最具有侵略性的帝国主义集团的利益，这些集团是利于保持反苏情绪和战争的歇斯底里的。
    在这件事情上，南斯拉夫政府的行动有如苏联的反对者和敌人，有如帝国主义集团的代理人。
    当南斯拉夫政府所玩弄的这一暧昧的诡计明白暴露之后，苏联政府自然不愿参与南斯拉夫政府所遵循的欺骗南斯拉夫人民的卑劣政策。
    同样可以了解，苏联政府不能再保卫南斯拉夫的领土要求，因为现在已经变得明显，南斯拉夫政府自己在一九四七年和英国政府代表团的秘密会谈中业已放弃了这些要求，因而使苏联政府不可能继续支持南斯拉夫的要求。
    （三）
    南斯拉夫政府感觉到它在斯洛文族加林西亚问题上的投降立场之无希望，和看到无法对舆论隐瞒卡德尔关于南斯拉夫政府声明放弃斯洛文族加林西亚的信件，南斯拉夫便借助于第三种诽谤性的捏造。它硬说苏联代表团强迫南斯拉夫政府和西方各国讨论南斯拉夫对奥地利的领土要求问题，而且说南斯拉夫政府之所以“愿意在这问题上作让步，纯然是因为苏联曾提出这样的要求”。
    真的，苏联代表们在一九四七、一九四八及一九四九年，在莫斯科、维也纳和伦敦的四强会议上的声明中，便曾揭穿南斯拉夫政府这种撒谎的谰言，他们曾在这些会议上公开与忠实地维护南斯拉夫对奥地利的一切领土及其他要求。然而，南斯拉夫政府却力图回避这些事实，而宁愿从事于无谓的闲谈。
    真的，苏联政府曾揭穿了南斯拉夫政府这种撒谎的谰言，在其八月十一日的照会中提醒南斯拉夫政府：一九四七年十一月苏联驻南斯拉夫大使曾在答复南斯拉夫外长的询问时曾告诉后者：苏联认为要南斯拉夫降低他的对奥领土要求一事，并无任何根据。但是，南斯拉夫政府回避这一事实，假装未注意到它。
    真的，苏联政府曾揭穿了南斯拉夫政府这种撒谎的谰言，它在其八月十一日的照会中提醒南斯拉夫政府：一九四八年苏联驻南斯拉夫大使曾再次重申苏联政府对于南斯拉夫降低领土要求之不合时宜所持的立场，并同时揭露贝勃勒在伦敦的万分可疑的行径。但这一次南斯拉夫政府也回避这一事实，假装盲目不知。这一切事实如果不是说明南斯拉夫政府正在心怀仇恨地诽谤苏联及其代表，硬说他们一直强迫南斯拉夫政府放弃南斯拉夫的领土要求、而南斯拉夫政府“虽然因为苏联政府提出了这样的要求”才准备作领土上的让步——如果上述一切事实不是说明这些的话，那么是说明什么呢？
    问题就发生了：如果苏联政府曾强迫南斯拉夫政府作领土上的让步的话，那么它为何不尽量利用卡德尔的信并同意南斯拉夫政府在这封信中所提出的关于全部或局部放弃南斯拉夫领土要求的建议呢？这点怎么解释呢？
    真的，如果苏联政府曾强迫南斯拉夫政府作领土上的让步的话，那么他为何不同意卡德尔的信？他为何要拒绝卡德尔的建议？南斯拉夫政府曾想到这点吗？
    只简单提出这种问题，就足以粉碎南斯拉夫政府硬说苏联政府曾固执地诱使它放弃南斯拉夫领土要求的一切诽谤的捏造，南斯拉夫政府难道没有发觉吗？
    放弃最大限度的领土要求是一般所可以容许的吗？在上述情况下，以最低限度的要求代替最大限度的要求是可以容许的吗？是的，是可以容许的，但有两个条件，这就是：如果这是出于不得已，即如果在一定的时间内没有希望实现最大限度的要求，而且，如果南斯拉夫政府对这种让步负责任。那么，苏联政府为何不同意卡德尔的建议呢？第一，因为卡德尔所建议的让步不是出于不得已，即是说最大限度的领土要求有实现的可能性。第二，因为南斯拉夫曾拒绝对卡德尔信中所提出的让步担负责任。南斯拉夫政府亟愿不由它而是由苏联对这些让步负责。苏联政府当然不可能赞助这种欺骗南斯拉夫人民的诡诈的阴谋。
    南斯拉夫政府企图把事情表现成这个样子，在外表上好象卡德尔之所以致函维辛斯基，是因为苏联代表曾企图获得对斯洛文族加林西亚问题的折衷解决，因此卡德尔的信件乃是对维辛斯基的建议的回答似的。然而在卡德尔的信件中，丝毫没有暗示这信件乃是对任何建议的答复，更没有暗示这信件是对苏联代表的要求的答复。相反的，卡德尔的信件毫无疑问的不是为对苏联代表的某种“要求”而写，而是出于卡德尔自己的主动。这可以从卡德尔的信中的头一句看出来：“由于存在着完全放弃目前形式的南斯拉夫对奥领土要求的可能性，而且如果你愿意提出新建议的话，我愿提起你对这些问题的注意，这些问题对于南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国是如此重要，以致必需觅取积极的解决”。
    由此我们可以看到卡德尔的信不是回答维辛斯基的任何建议或要求。如果卡德尔的信是对维辛斯基的建议或要求提出答复，它就会是这样写的：“由于（‘由于’二字加重点——原注）你愿意提出新建议”或“鉴于你愿意提出新建议”。然而信中却陈述的某些全然不同的事实，即：“假如（‘假如’二字加重点——原注）你愿意提出新建议”。所以，卡德尔的信并不是对维辛斯基的任何建议或要求的答复。而是向维辛斯基提出问题：你愿提出新建议吗？大家知道，苏联政府否定地回答卡德尔的问题苏联政府声称：它无意提出修改南斯拉夫对斯洛文族加林西亚要求的建议。苏联政府回答道：南斯拉夫的要求的修改不是出于不得已的，且假若南斯拉夫政府坚持其主张，那么必须负担对领土要求的全部责任，而且只有南斯拉夫政府对此种让步担负全部责任之后，苏联政府才准备在外长会议上对这种新立场作为南斯拉夫政府的立场加以维护。
    大家知道，南斯拉夫政府想把对领土让步的责任推卸在苏联政府身上，它拒绝对这种让步负责任，想对南斯拉夫人民隐蔽其新的投降立场。
    为着明了起见，我们还是引用卡德尔关于南斯拉夫政府放弃其领土要求的信的原文罢：
    “致莫斯科。一九四七年四月二十日。
    维辛斯基同志：
    由于存在着完全放弃目前形式的南斯拉夫对奥领土要求的可能性，而且如果你愿意提出新建议的话，我愿提起你对于这些问题的注意，它们对于南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国是如此重要以致必需觅取积极的解决。这些问题的积极解决即为对于南斯拉夫领土要求的最低限度的满足。
    第一个问题是关于格瓦别克与拉鲍德电力站问题。我在向部长会议所作的报告中，曾着重指出这些电力站对南斯拉夫电气工业的特别重要性。格瓦别克与拉鲍德电力站是由维也纳德国电力工厂股份公司在德奥合并以后，主要是在战时，不顾一九二六年公约（该公约中，奥国曾保证不经南斯拉夫事前同意即不在德拉瓦建筑任何东西）而建筑的。因而这些电力站是奥地利西区中除了签署巴黎赔偿会议决议的其它国家外南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国也应自其中提取一部分赔偿的德国资产。不仅如此，这些电力站的建筑没有考虑到南斯拉夫电气工业的需要，并且在现行使用制度之下，它们造成了巨大损失——在有些月份，将近一百万千瓦时。问题可以借对边界略加修改而解决，为此目的，我向你提出两个方案的草案，最后可由确立南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国在这些动力站管理机构中的特别权利而求得解决。兹附上这种制度的计划一份。
    第二个问题是关于特别保护加林西亚斯洛文族人的民族权利。鉴于斯洛文族人对奥地利的历史经验，可以确定，在条约签订之后，加紧日耳曼化的企图将发生。奥地利于德国崩溃后在加林西亚境内担承了——尽管只是一纸空文——一些旨在表现其在民族问题上的容忍的笼络人心之措施（例如重建使用两种语言的学校），事实上直到今天连这种措施都没有在执行。因此，如果在条约中共同协议，将业已取得法律效力的措施予以增加，并作为条约的组成部分将此种措施完全受四强管制的话，将是具有巨大重要性的。兹附上这种制度基本原则的计划书一份。顺致敬礼。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　卡德尔
    第一个方案
    第一个方案包括普利贝尔兹（布莱堡）行政区，目前奥南边界之间的地区，德拉瓦河与比斯特里卡（费斯特里茨）和布拉托（姆斯）两村的西界，以及德拉瓦河北面的拉鲍德村（拉瓦姆恩德）及柳得村（鲁登）之毗连德拉瓦河并为横越第八百八十二高地之山脉沿线与该村的其余部分隔离的地区。这样，所包括的领土有二百一十方公里，据一九三四年奥国的户口调查，有人口九千三百九十六人。
    该区民族组成可以根据附表详细审查。奥地利一九一○年所进行的户口调查虽然大家知道不利于斯洛文人，可是也在这块领土上表明了斯洛文人占显然的多数（六千六百九十六名斯洛文人，二千八百七十八名日耳曼人）。
    在一九二○年公民表决时，该区大多数投了南斯拉夫的票。
    第二个方案
    第二个方案包括德拉瓦河之南——利勃尔利茨（莱夫林）及兹瓦别克（施瓦德克）两村，与德拉瓦河之北——拉鲍德村（拉瓦姆恩德）及柳得村（鲁登）的小部分。这一方案约包有六十三方公里的领土，而且根据一九三四年奥国户口调查，有人口三千一百五十人。
    民族组成比第一个方案中略坏，因为拉鲍德村（据本方案所规定大多数居民住在该村）曾受强烈日耳曼化。”
    （四）
    南斯拉夫政府在其八月二十日的照会中向苏联政府要求：苏联政府对南斯拉夫政府表现特别尊重甚至热爱，并在苏联致南斯拉夫政府的照会中表示这种尊重和热爱；而且照会还不应包含任何可能伤害南斯拉夫政府自尊心或触犯这种自尊心的东西。南斯拉夫政府声称，按照“国际定则”，是必须如此的。
    苏联政府不得不声明，南斯拉夫政府所要求于苏联政府者乃不可能的事。
    众所周知，南斯拉夫政府背弃社会主义与民主阵营，投靠帝国主义与法西斯主义阵营。
    必须指出，苏联人民与苏联公众对于叛徒是没有尊敬的。他们尤其不能对叛徒表示热爱。还不仅仅这样，众所周知，苏联人民与苏联公众是蔑视叛徒的。
    当然有各种各样的叛徒。有图侥幸的叛徒，他们由于怯懦而叛变，想要保全他们的性命。也有别的叛徒，心怀恶意的叛徒。这些便是这样一种人，他们之背叛不仅是为了保全性命，而且还要为害他们所背叛的阵营。不论怎样可悲都必须声明，苏联人民与苏联公众把南斯拉夫政府不是归类于图侥幸者一类，而是归类为怀有恶意的叛徒。
    还必须进一步指出：怀有恶意的叛徒也是各式各样的。有的是那样的怀有恶意的叛徒，他们感觉到有罪，对他们的耻辱感到痛苦，设法使自己不为人所注意和隐藏起来，并且举止几乎是自惭形秽的。但是，也有那样一些心怀恶意的叛徒，他们靠他们的寡廉鲜耻牟利，吵吵嚷嚷把自己的背叛粉饰成一种英雄主义的行为，象戏台上的傀儡一样跳出来诋毁他们所背叛的那个阵营，并且厚颜无耻地吹嘘什么他们能够经常对这个阵营狂吠，因此，他们不是某种简单的叛徒，而是英雄。正象克里洛夫的寓言中所说的一样，小狗对大象吠叫，总觉得自己了不起似的。
    不论怎样可悲，都必须声明，苏联人民与苏联公众恰恰把南斯拉夫归类为这种自吹自捧的心怀恶意的叛徒。
    社会公众的意见便是如此，苏联政府自当依此行事。
    我们希望南斯拉夫政府会认到：它不用指望苏联政府对它会有什么礼节，至于尊敬就更不用想了。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　莫斯科，一九四九年八月二十九日
