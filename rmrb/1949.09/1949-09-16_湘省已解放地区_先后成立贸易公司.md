Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 15th: State-owned trade in Changsha and other liberated areas of Hunan Province has been rapidly developing. The Changsha City Trade Company and its first retail department, the trade companies in Changsha, Changde, and Yiyang Special Districts, and the trade companies in Yueyang, Pingjiang, and other counties have all been established one after another. Material exchanges within and outside the province are becoming increasingly smooth. A large number of goods, including salt, cotton yarn, cloth, flour, and kerosene, allocated to Hunan by the Central China Trade Corporation have been continuously arriving in Changsha. Trade companies in Changde, Yueyang, Pingjiang, and other places supply food and local products to cities such as Changsha in exchange for civilian industrial products.

In addition, in order to support the private-owned knitting, weaving, dyeing, and homespun cloth factories in Changsha to resume production, the Changsha Municipal People's Government has decided that the Bureau of Industry and Commerce and the trade company will allocate and sell cotton yarn to the factories at a price 10% lower than the market price, based on their production needs. The allocation started on the 2nd of this month, and more than 30 factories have received the allocation.

    【新华社长沙十五日电】长沙市及湖南省已解放各地区的国营贸易事业已迅速展开。长市贸易公司及所属第一门市部，长沙、常德、益阳等专区的贸易公司及岳阳、平江等县贸易公司都已先后成立，省内外的物资交流日渐畅达。由华中贸易总公司拨运湖南的大批食盐、棉纱、布匹、面粉、煤油等货物已源源运抵长市。常德、岳阳、平江等各地贸易公司则以食粮和土产品供应长沙等城市，换取民用工业品。
    又：长市人民政府为扶植针织、织染、土布等私营工厂恢复生产，决定由工商局及贸易公司根据复业各厂的生产需要，以低于市价十分之一的价格配售棉纱，配售于本月二日开始，获得配售的工厂达三十余家。
