　　My Mind is Clear Now!
　　——A Soldier's Wife's Conversation
　　Chang Hai
　　Speaking of my Shuanzhu, it’s not just a mother’s biased opinion, but he really is a promising good kid! Ever since he was little, he wasn't like the other kids who were always jumping around, fighting, and being naughty; he was always well-behaved like an adult. Everyone in the village praised him when they saw him: "Shuanzhu is a good lad!"
　　At the age of eight, he went to work for the landlord herding cattle. In wind and rain, from the east hillside to the west hillside, he never had good clothes or shoes. The white homespun clothes he wore were patched all over, and he tied two pieces of broken shoe soles to his feet with hemp rope. His body was covered with red welts from being scratched by thorns... Just a small child! He never complained. He saw his family eating bran and wild herbs, and with tears in his eyes, he went to suffer for the landlord, hoping to earn some grain to improve things for his family.
　　Later, he worked as a "banhuo" (small job laborer). At sixteen, he learned to hold the plow. Whether it was in the threshing ground or in the fields, he could handle any farm work! Nothing worried him. Whether it was sowing with a seed drill or spreading manure and seeds, some veteran farmers with decades of experience weren't as good as him! He was quick-witted and skilled. He could learn any job with just a little instruction.
　　As for his joining the army, he joined during the fight against the Japanese devils. That was seven or eight years ago. The year before last, he sent a letter back saying he had been promoted to platoon leader. I, this old woman, was so happy I almost died!
　　Alas! I’m not afraid of you laughing at me, comrade, but ever since Shuanzhu left, I felt like I was missing a piece of myself and I could never stop worrying. What mother doesn’t think of her own son?
　　When the land was distributed the year before last, our family received fifteen mu. There weren't enough people to work it, and the old man couldn't manage it alone. At that time, I thought of Shuanzhu again! If only our Shuanzhu was at home, how great that would be! Those fifteen mu of land could yield so much grain! That child suffered for others since he was little, how happy he would be to farm his own land now! After Beijing was liberated last year, I sent him a letter, telling him to "defeat Chiang Kai-shek as soon as possible and come home to farm!" A few days later, he sent a letter back from the army. I asked Teacher Wang to read it, and the words in it didn’t sound like something a farmer would say at all. The letter contained three long paragraphs. He wrote more than one paragraph just to address what I said about “coming home to farm,” complaining that I hadn't thought things through, saying that even if Chiang Kai-shek was defeated, maybe the American devils would still try to cause trouble; after the whole country was liberated, we still needed to build a strong nation. He gave me an example: if you plant a sapling, you have to water it diligently, trim the excess branches, and check on it often, or else it won’t grow well, or it will be eaten by livestock, or someone else will pull it out... He told me not to just think about those few mu of land, but to think more about the people of the whole country and future generations… I felt terrible when I heard that! How come this child wasn't listening to his elders anymore, and was even "counting up" (criticizing) me in his letter? After Teacher Wang left, I thought about it all afternoon, and then I lay on the kang at night and kept thinking for most of the night before I understood: of course! If all the mothers in China were like me, calling their children home to farm, wouldn’t Chiang Kai-shek and the American devils still oppress us? Living by farming wouldn’t be peaceful either! That cleared my mind completely. No matter what, I couldn't call the child home! The next day, I asked Teacher Wang to write him another letter, which said: "Shuanzhu! What you said in your letter is right. Even if Chiang Kai-shek is defeated, we still need to build a new country, and we can't just think about going home to farm! Mother didn't think things through last time. But my mind is clear now, you should work hard in the army! For the sake of our family's fifteen mu of land, for the sake of children like your Suotou and others being able to live a good life in the future, you must hold your gun tightly and always be a good soldier defending the motherland!"

　　我心眼亮堂了！
    ——一个军属的谈话
    长海 
    说起我们拴柱来，不是我做娘的有偏心眼，那可真是个有出息的好孩子！从打一小，就不象别的孩子们那么乱蹦、乱跳的打架、淘气，规规矩矩的象个大人，村里人谁见了也都夸奖他：“拴柱子是个好后生！”
    八岁上，他就给财主去放牛，风里雨里，从东山坡转到西山坡，又没个好穿好戴的，一身白土布衣裳穿成了一条一块的，脚上用麻绳绑上两块破鞋底，身上叫“葛针”（即荆棘）给划的净是一条条的红道道……——才几尺高高的一个孩子啊！他一回也没有叫过苦，——他看看家里一大家子人吃糠咽菜的情形，含着眼泪去给财主受苦，想挣点粮食给家里人换换胃口。
    以后又给人家当“伴伙”（即小做活的），十六岁上就学会了扶犁，不管是场里、地里，凡是庄稼活那样也拿的起来！一点也不发愁，你说是使耧耩地，还是撒粪丢籽，十几年的老把式有的还都不如他！心眼机灵，手巧，不论啥活，一指点就会。
    提起他参军的事，他还是打日本鬼子的时候就参加了，算起来有个七、八年了，前年个打回信来，说是升了排长，把我这老婆子活活没喜欢死！
    唉！说出来不怕同志你笑话，自从拴柱子一走，我这心里就象少了块东西，老是放不下。当娘的那个不惦记自己儿子啊？
    前年分地时，我们家分了十五亩，没人手，光老头子一个人做不过来，这时候我又想起拴柱来啦！要是我们拴柱在家，那该多好哇！这十五亩地不知道该打多少粮食哩！那孩子从小就给人家受苦，这会也种种自个的地，那该多高兴！去年北京解放以后，我就给他捎了一封信去，叫他“早点打垮蒋介石，回家种地！”过了不几天，他从队伍上打回信来，请王教员一念，上边那话一点也不象个庄稼人说的，那个意见写了满满三大篇。为了我说的“回家种地”那句话，就写了一篇多，埋怨我心眼没想开，说是蒋介石打垮了说不定美国洋鬼子还想捣乱；全国解放了还要把国家建设强大。给我打比方：一棵小树栽起来了，要不勤浇水、勤修理毛毛枝、勤去查看着点，就会长不好或者被牲口啃了，或者被别人拔了，……叫我别光顾眼下这几亩地，要多替全国老百姓和下辈子子孙孙们打算打算………我当下听了，心里好不是滋味！怎么这孩子也不听老人话了，还在信上“数得”（即批评之意）起我来？王教员走了，我一个人想了一后晌，黑间躺在坑上又直直想了多半夜，这才明白过来：本来么！全中国当娘的要都象我这样把自个孩子都叫回家种地，蒋介石、美国洋鬼子不还是照样欺压咱们吗？种地过日子也不安生啊！这一下我心眼里可真是想开了，＠么着也不能叫孩子回来！第二天，我就又请王教员给他写了一封信，信上这么说：“拴柱子！你来信说的那话很对，蒋介石打垮了也不能不管建设新国家，光顾回家种地！娘上回写信是一时想不开，这回我可是心眼亮堂了，你在队伍上好好干吧！为了咱家那十五亩地，为了你们锁头他们这帮小人们以后过好日子，你要握紧枪杆，永远做一个保卫祖国的好战士！”
