    [Reported by this newspaper] The Beijing Municipal Bureau of Education is vigorously assisting out-of-school children of workers to enroll in schools. In the second semester of this year, municipal primary and secondary schools have already enrolled 2,674 children of workers. Recently, it was decided that municipal primary schools will enroll another 1,650 children of workers. During the first general enrollment of municipal secondary schools in early July, 402 children of workers were admitted. On August 22nd, the Secondary Education Section of the Education Bureau and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions formed a unified enrollment committee to enroll organized children of workers. After review by the trade union, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions submitted the names of 932 applicants, all of whom have now been admitted and assigned to municipal secondary schools and Xin Sheng, Da Zhong, Da Tong, and Changxindian schools. In early August, the Primary Education Section of the Education Bureau formed a unified enrollment committee, which decided to recruit students who are children of workers in public factories. All 1,340 applicants were admitted and have now entered various municipal primary schools. Recently, it was decided to hold a second enrollment for children of workers, mainly targeting direct relatives of workers in various industries and private factories with impoverished families. Out-of-school children of workers in public factories and scattered laborers can also apply. 1,650 students will be admitted. Applicants can bring a letter of introduction from their trade union directly to the municipal primary schools to register for the examination. It has also been decided that children of workers from impoverished families who are unable to pay fees will be exempted from miscellaneous fees upon certification by the district government or trade union.
