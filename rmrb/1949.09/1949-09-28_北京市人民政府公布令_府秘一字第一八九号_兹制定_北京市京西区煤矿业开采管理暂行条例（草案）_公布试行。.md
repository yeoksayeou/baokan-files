    Provisional Regulations (Draft) for the Administration of Coal Mine Exploitation in the Jingxi District of Beijing

    Chapter I: General Provisions
    Article 1: These Regulations are specifically formulated to carry out long-term economic construction and protect and develop the coal mining industry in this district.
    Article 2: No one within this district shall engage in mining any mineral deposit without applying for registration of mining rights in accordance with the provisions of these Regulations, obtaining a license upon approval by the competent authority, and being subject to government supervision and guidance during the mining period.

    Chapter II: Mining Rights
    Article 3: The provisions for mining areas are as follows:
    (1) The boundary of the mining area shall be determined by straight lines. The scope of mining within the mining area shall be limited to the area included by the vertical lines downward from the boundary, and no mining shall be conducted beyond the boundary.
    (2) The area of the mining area shall be calculated based on the horizontal area within the boundary.
    (3) Mining areas are divided into large and small. A large mining area ranges from ten hectares to five hundred hectares, and any area less than ten hectares is considered a small mining area. (Each hectare is calculated as 10,000 square meters)
    Article 4: Adjacent mining areas of different mining rights shall be separated by a mining distance of at least 20 meters between large mines and at least 10 meters between small mines. If large and small mining areas are adjacent, the mining distance of the large mine shall prevail.
    Article 5: The term of mining rights is limited to 20 years for large mines and 5 years for small mines. If continued mining is desired after the expiration of the mining term, an extension may be applied for.
    Article 6: The effective date of mining rights shall be calculated from the date of government approval, registration, and license acquisition.
    Those who have obtained mining rights before the implementation of these Regulations must re-apply for registration, otherwise, they will be invalid. Those currently engaged in mining should also submit an operating report (form attached separately) (omitted) and apply for registration within two months from the date of promulgation of these Regulations. Mining operations may continue during the application period.
    Article 7: When two or more parties apply for mining rights in the same mining area, those using mechanized mining shall have priority for registration. If all use mechanized mining, approval shall be granted according to the order of application.
    Article 8: If there are several kinds of minerals in the same mining area, the by-products may be mined in addition to the main product. Anyone who wishes to mine by-products without obtaining the mining rights for the main product must obtain the consent of the original mining right holder before mining. Those mining by-products as described in the preceding paragraph must apply for separate registration.
    Article 9: The mining of mineral deposits is prohibited within 50 meters of cities, streets, villages, towns, railways, water conservancy projects, national defense projects, and other important buildings, unless otherwise specifically stipulated.
    Article 10: Applicants for mining rights shall prepare three copies each of the application form and mining area map and submit them to the local mining bureau or county government for forwarding to the Beijing Municipal Government for verification and issuance of a mining license, and for forwarding to the North China People's Government for record-keeping.
    The application form shall state the following items:
    ① Applicant's name, age, occupation, native place, address, (telephone number). ② Type and name of coal mine. ③ Detailed address and area of the mining area. ④ Estimated reserves and mining volume. ⑤ Total amount of capital. ⑥ Mode of operation (public, private, public-private joint venture). ⑦ Operating plan. ⑧ Supporting documents from the local mining bureau or county government. ⑨ Date of application.
    The mining area map shall indicate the following items:
    ① Orientation, distance, and area of the mining area. ② Place names, mountain names, water names, or permanent buildings near the mining area. ③ Indication of the north-south line. ④ Strike and dip of the coal seam outcrop (coal trace). The mining area map shall be drawn in meters (mining area map format attached separately) (omitted)
    Article 11: The position, boundary, and area of the mining area on the mining area map shall be based on the coordinates and distances between measuring points. If the results of separate measurements from two base points are inconsistent, the measurement from the first base point shall prevail.
    Article 12: Applicants for mining rights shall commence mining within six months of obtaining the mining license and report the commencement date, construction progress, and key technical personnel to the original approving authority. If mining is not commenced within the deadline without justifiable reason and there is no preparation for mining, the original approving authority may revoke the mining rights.
    Article 13: Applicants for mining rights shall not lease them out privately or engage in indiscriminate mining in disregard of the plan after obtaining the mining license. Each coal mine shall submit reports on construction progress and business conditions to the local competent authority and the Beijing Municipal Government for review in four quarterly installments in March, June, September, and December each year. If necessary, the local competent authority and the Beijing Municipal Government may send personnel to inspect the coal mine. Periods of less than three months shall also be considered as one installment. (Reporting form attached separately) (omitted)
    Article 14: After mining rights are approved, the mining right holder shall pay taxes in accordance with the law to the local tax collection authority when obtaining the mining license.
    Article 15: If there are any changes to the mining area after the mining rights are obtained (such as increases or decreases, corrections, mergers, divisions, etc.), the owner of the mining rights shall prepare a revised map and description and apply to the original approving authority for the change. If an independent operator transfers the coal mine or forms a joint-stock operation, they shall submit the reasons and details to the original approving authority for review and approval, and report to the Beijing Municipal Government for record-keeping.
    Article 16: If the facilities of the coal mine require the occupation of another person's land, houses, or trees, they shall first consult with the original owner and pay a reasonable price for purchase or lease. If disputes arise between the two parties, the government shall arbitrate the matter.
    Article 17: If mining causes damage to surface buildings or changes in soil quality that affect production, the owner shall negotiate with the landowner for compensation. If disputes arise between the two parties, the government shall arbitrate the matter.
    Article 18: The government reserves the right of first refusal to purchase any mineral product, and the mining operator shall not refuse.
    Article 19: When necessary, the government may at any time reclaim the mining rights of a mined area and stop mining, and purchase part or all of its equipment according to the specific situation.

    Chapter III: Penal Provisions
    Article 20: Overtly trespassing across the boundaries of the mining areas when mining is strictly prohibited. In addition to the party at fault being held accountable for the losses they caused they may also be fined.
    Article 21: Anyone who engages in unauthorized mining without approval shall be ordered to stop mining immediately and shall be subject to a fine of a certain amount.
    Article 22: Anyone who intentionally damages the mining area, sets fire to it, or floods it, affecting production, shall be liable for compensation and shall be handed over to the court for handling according to the seriousness of the circumstances.
