Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 20th—The devaluation of the pound sterling has caused tremendous turmoil in all capitalist countries outside the United States. On the evening of the 18th, after Cripps officially announced the devaluation of the pound sterling by one-third, many countries immediately ordered the suspension of foreign exchange and market activities and convened emergency cabinet meetings to discuss countermeasures. Countries in the Sterling Area, such as Australia, the Union of South Africa, Ireland, Egypt, Israel, India, and countries with close business ties to the United Kingdom, such as Denmark and Norway, announced the devaluation of their respective currencies by the same proportion that evening. On the 19th, France, the Netherlands, Sweden, Iceland, Finland, and Ceylon formally announced or decided to devalue their currencies. It is estimated that about 30 currencies will be affected by the devaluation of the pound sterling and have their exchange rates revised. The new exchange rates of the devalued currencies against the U.S. dollar are as follows: The Irish pound, South African pound, and Israeli pound have all been devalued from the original $4.03 per pound to $2.80 per pound, the Australian pound from $3.22 to $2.24, and the Egyptian pound from $4.133 to $2.871. India has devalued from 30 cents per rupee to 21 cents, Denmark from 21 cents per krone to 14 cents, Norway from 20 cents per krone to 14 cents, and Sweden from 27.7 cents per krona to 19.3 cents. Ceylon has devalued from 30 cents per rupee to 21 cents. In addition, France has decided to devalue the franc by 10 percent, and Finland has decided to devalue the Finnish mark by 29.5 percent.
