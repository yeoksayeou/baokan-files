　　Second Sewing Department of the Clothing Factory
　　Summarizes First Phase of Production
　　Seventy-Five Workers Elected as Models
　　[This City News] The first phase of the winter clothing production campaign of the Second Sewing Department of the Beijing Clothing Factory has been successfully completed thanks to the efforts of all the workers. From July 22nd, in forty days, a total of 68,550 sets were completed, with an overall average of 6.4495 sets completed per person per day. At the same time, the second phase of the production task, 3,000 sets of cadre uniforms, was completed ahead of schedule. After completing the production tasks, the factory workers conducted a democratic summary before September 6th, mutually evaluated work attitudes and work achievements, and elected seventy-five labor models, who were publicly commended by the administration. They also put forward many suggestions for improvement to the leadership and for future work.

　　The male and female workers of the Second Sewing Department greatly improved their production enthusiasm because the factory administration adjusted the wage system according to the spirit of "more work, more pay," changing the past basic wage system to a piece-rate wage system; and adjusted and handled unreasonable personnel matters. Not long after the start of the production campaign, a competition was launched between classes, and workers voluntarily added night shifts. For example, female workers in classes 1 and 2 added a night shift every other day. Female worker Chen Yanying had to get up and rush to work after only two hours of sleep and only stopped after being dissuaded. Many male workers in classes 7 and 8 worked overtime. In order to save electricity, four machines shared one light bulb, and each class saved a lot of thread. During this production process, Party members and Youth League members played a leading role, with Party members vying to do the heavy work of operating the back car (machine sewing), uniting the broad masses of workers to actively produce, and transforming backward workers who liked to dawdle. For example, workers Yang Zhongshan and Miao Jipu used to like to quarrel with people and were lazy, but after explanation and persuasion, their production volume greatly increased. Yang Zhongshan was also elected as a labor model (averaging 11.985 sets per day).

　　From August 29th to September 4th, the factory convened Party and Youth League member conferences, joint meetings of trade union group leaders and administrative class leaders, and mass meetings to make democratic summaries and launch a model worker evaluation campaign. The workers put forward valuable suggestions to the leadership to correct procrastination and strengthen publicity and explanation work to the workers. The workers themselves set three standards for electing labor models: (1) High production and good quality; (2) Compliance with labor discipline, saving raw materials, caring for machines, and punctuality; (3) Helping others, being good to the masses, and not quarreling with people. Based on these standards, seventy-five labor models were elected. Yu Shuzhen, the first-place female labor model, averaged 10.54 sets per day, Wang Xiuying, the second-place, 8.49 sets, and Niu Ruizhen, the third-place, 8.099 sets. Jin Shuren, the first-place male worker, averaged 12.37 sets per day, followed by Yang Zhongshan with 11.985 sets, and Cui Demiao with 10.144 sets.

　　During the production process, in order to stabilize production enthusiasm and take care of worker welfare, the factory administration improved the complicated procedures for purchasing from the cooperative: (1) Cooperative members' purchases are registered by the trade union group leader, eliminating the individual registration procedures at the cooperative. (2) Fixed workers (class leaders, staff, etc.) are mobilized to register receipts and handle procedures, decentralizing the centralized procedures to the heads of each production unit (such as administrative class leaders). (3) Canteens and sales departments were added. The workers were very happy with these improvements.

　　被服厂第二缝纫部
　  总结一期生产
　  七十五人当选模范
    【本市讯】北平被服厂第二缝纫部第一期冬装生产突击任务，由于全体工友的努力，已胜利完成。自七月二十二日起四十天内，共完成了六万八千五百五十套，总平均每日每人完成六·四四九五套，同时并提前完成了第二期生产任务干部服三千套。全厂工人在完成生产任务后，于九月六日前做了民主总结，相互评定了劳动态度、工作成绩，选出了七十五个劳动模范，行政上曾当众予以表扬。他们对领导上及今后工作还提出了不少的改进意见。
    第二缝纫部全体男、女工友，由于工厂行政上根据多劳多酬的精神调整了工资制度，将过去基本工资制改为计件工资制；和调整处理了不合理的人事，生产情绪大大提高。在生产突击任务开始不久，便开展了班与班的竞赛，工人自动加了夜班。如：一、二班女工每隔一天便加一次夜班，女工陈燕英刚睡了两个钟头便要起来赶活儿，经劝阻后才不做。七、八班的男工加班的很多。他们为了节约，四台机器合用一个电灯，各班都节约了不少线。在此次生产过程中，党团员都起了带头作用，党员争着去做上后车（机器缝纫）的繁重工作，团结了广大的工人群众积极生产，并且改造了爱泡蘑菇的落后工人。如：工友杨仲山、苗计浦，过去本来爱和人吵架，好偷懒，经过解释说服，生产量便大大提高。杨仲山还被选做劳动模范（每天平均做一一·九八五套）。
    八月二十九日到九月四日间，全厂分别召集了党、团员大会，工会小组长、行政班长的联席会，及群众大会，做出了民主总结，和展开评模运动，工人群众给领导上提出要纠正拖拉作风，和加强对工人宣传解释工作的宝贵意见。工友们自己订出选举劳动模范的三个标准：（一）生产多、质量好；（二）遵守劳动纪律，节省原料，爱护机器，守时刻；（三）帮助别人，对群众好，不和人争吵。并根据这个标准选出劳动模范七十五人。女工劳动模范第一名于淑珍，平均每天做一○·五四套，第二名王秀英八·四九套，第三名牛瑞珍八·○九九套。男工第一名靳树仁，平均每天做十二·三七套，其次杨仲山十一·九八五套，崔德淼一○·一四四套。
    在生产过程中，该厂行政上为了安定生产情绪，照顾工人福利，改进了合作社购买时的繁复手续：（一）社员购物由工会组长登记，取消个人去合作社的登记手续。（二）发动固定工（班长职员等）去登记收款，办理手续，把集中去合作社的手续分散到各生产单位的负责人（如行政班长）去办。（三）增设伙食团、贩卖部等。工友们对这些改进都很高兴。
