　　Fellow Travelers
    By Soviet author Panova, translated by Su Ling, proofread by Cao Jinghua

    Part One: Night
    Chapter Two: Lina
    But there's not much time for such a world. Either she's called to the kitchen to peel potatoes, or Dr. Suprunov gives a lecture on personal hygiene. In the morning, Danilov gathers all the staff to report the news, then explains how barbaric the fascists are, saying that our army's setbacks are temporary, and the Red Army will eventually win. The Hitlerite bandits will be crushed... Listening to Danilov's words, Lina thought, "Why do you have to tell us so much? Even if you didn't tell me, I know that we and Danila will win, we must win, otherwise the enemy will kill Danila and kill me, and we will never be happy..." The German army's occupation of one city after another doesn't make people panic. Oh, another city is occupied. It doesn't matter. Anyway, we will recover it. It's best to quickly drive back the enemy, to restore the past life, so that Danila can return from military service. She hasn't received a letter from him yet, but she knows he's alive.
    Lina sleeps soundly at night, neither Danilov's inspections nor the train's collisions disturb her sweet dreams. When she wakes up, it's already dawn. Before dawn, she had a good dream.
    She lies there, with her eyes closed, smiling in her dream, and then she immediately remembers without opening her eyes: this is not real, she is on a hospital train, going to the front to rescue the wounded soldiers, the train is stopped – has it already arrived?
    She jumps up and leans out of the window: a road policeman's watchtower, grassland and forest, little birds are already singing in the forest, the east is a rosy glow, a pink and light rosy glow, such a beautiful rosy glow, it really makes people want to cry. The sky is full of clouds, like pink feathers – she has never seen such a sky before…
    The train stopped at a small station again. No one is worried about us…
    She got up early. Everyone is still sleeping. There are still two hours before getting up… She can lie down and look at this morning scenery – perhaps she will have a good dream…
    But Commissar Danilov is already up. He came out of the kitchen car. Lina, wearing a skirt and barefoot, came out of the car. The morning is fresh, and the birds are singing higher and higher. In the fence next to the watchtower, a cluster of lilacs is in full bloom – under the clusters of flowers, the green leaves are invisible… Lina wanted to pick a branch, she walked towards the fence.
    "Hey, Lina!" Danilov shouted to Lina, who was reaching for the lilac flowers. "Come back – we're about to leave. You'll miss the train."
    Lina just pouted. About to leave! Just think, what kind of express train is it? When the train starts, can't she jump on? She picked a flower, and fresh dewdrops splashed on her face.
    The train started. Danilov slipped into the car. Lina deliberately stood on the roadbed and waited. The hot wind under the wheels blew on her bare legs. When the last car came to her, she grabbed the railing, and with a light jump, she stepped onto the footboard, which was higher than her knees. She stood on the footboard, pleased with herself – how agile she jumped, how strong she was, the wind blowing on her forehead and chest, how pleasant… "Look, Comrade Da," she said with a smile, "look at what kind of…" and then asked him to admire her fully, and then went into the car.

    Chapter Three: Doctor Bilov
    The hospital train stopped at the Vejipusk vehicle marshalling station in Leningrad. It was promised that a locomotive would be allocated in half an hour; but two hours passed, and there was still no locomotive. Dr. Bilov paced back and forth near the command car, muttering:
    "This is really terrible…"
    This was not about the stop. The doctor had sent a telegram to his wife, saying that he was passing through Leningrad and asked her to come to the station. But which station their car would stop at, he didn't even know until this morning. Now he doesn't see her. This is really terrible. The main thing is, perhaps she is already here, wandering on this hot, crisscrossing ground looking for him. And there are dozens of locomotives and thousands of carriages here. Once they are allocated a locomotive, they will leave, and she won't have time to find him. The doctor is suffering. Several times he thought about going to the middle of the train to look for her. Once, he had already left the command car. But he was afraid: what if the car suddenly left when he was not there? Of course, he could catch up. But what would Danilov say? The doctor was a little afraid of Danilov.
    Danilov greeted him and passed by: he hadn't met the commander today. From the morning, there was a party meeting to elect the party organizer. Yuli was elected, and Danilov also voted for her, because there was no one else to choose, but now he began to doubt. Although she has all the qualities of a man, she is, after all, a woman. And the organizer will have a lot of trouble with Doctor Bilov in the future. Danilov dealt with the problem in this way in his heart: Bilov should be appointed as the train commander. But how can a woman's weak wrist withstand such a thing…
    Danilov greeted him, feeling pity for him in his heart. The doctor, wearing a uniform, was walking in the sun. The pocket on the chest of his coat was bulging, like a square piece of pig iron; what did he put in it? Under the shiny cap badge, his high nose was also shining. Sweat flowed down the sides of his nose. The doctor was baked as hot as the roof under the scorching sun.
    "It's so hot!" Danilov said.
    "Don't mention it," the doctor replied. "You know, I can feel how hot the gravel is through the soles of my shoes."
    Danilov carefully looked down at his feet: he didn't know what it was called gravel; he liked to know these kinds of things. Old intellectuals always tell you something.
    "Where did they stop us?" the doctor continued. "It seems like a forest swamp area by the railway, I am an old Leningrad resident, but I don't know these places."
    Danilov didn't answer; isn't it all the same wherever you stop? The main thing is to drive to the destination and back. He didn't know why the doctor was distressed, and he didn't know that the doctor really wanted to cry like a child.

    第一部　夜
    第二章　琳娜
    可是对于这样的世界没有多少功夫呵。不是叫她到厨房去削马铃薯，就是苏普鲁戈夫医生讲个人卫生的演讲。早晨达尼洛夫召集全体工作人员报告消息，然后解释着法西斯是多么野蛮，说什么我军的失利是暂时的，红军终会胜利的。希特勒党徒将会被粉碎的……琳娜听了达尼洛夫的话就想道：“你干吗给我们讲得这么长呢，——你不讲我也知道我们和达尼拉会胜利的，不会不胜利的，否则敌人就会把达尼拉打死，把我打死，我们永远不会有幸福的了……”对于德军一个城一个城的占领，并不能使人心惊的。呵，又占领了一个城。没关系。反正我们会收复的。最好只有快些把敌人打退，好恢复已往的生活，好使达尼拉解甲归来。她还没收着他一封信，可是晓得他是活着呢。
    琳娜夜里睡得很熟，无论达尼洛夫的巡视，也无论列车的撞碰，都没有惊破她的酣梦。她醒来的时候，已经是天亮了。天未亮的时候，她作了一个好梦。
    她躺着，闭着眼睛，在梦里微笑着，于是即刻没睁开眼睛就想起来：这没有的事，她是在救护列车上呢，到前方去救护伤兵呢，列车在停着，——难道已经到了吗？
    她跳起来，身子伸到窗外一看：路警的岗楼，草原和森林，小鸟儿已经在森林里歌唱着，东方是一片朝霞，粉红的轻飘的朝霞，这样好看的朝霞呵，真要叫人流起眼泪来了。满天都是云，就象粉红羽毛似的，——她从来还不曾见过这样的天空呢……
    车又停到小站上了。没有人替我们着急呢……
    她早早儿起来。大家都还正在睡着呢。离起床还有两个钟头呢……可以躺下望着这清晨的景色——或许还会做一个好梦吧……
    可是委员达尼洛夫已经起来了。他从厨车里出来了。琳娜穿着裙子，光着脚，从车里出来了。清晨是新爽的，鸟儿越唱越高了。岗楼旁边的篱垣里，一丛紫丁香盛开着——一蓬蓬的花下，看不见绿叶了……琳娜想摘一枝来，她往篱垣跟前走着。
    “喂，琳娜！”达尼洛夫对那向丁香花伸着手的琳娜喊道。“回来——我们现在要开车了。你要误车的。”
    琳娜只把嘴噘了噘。要开车了！你想想吧，多么样的特快车呵。车开动的时候，她跳不上去吗？她摘了一枝花，新爽的露珠儿溅到她脸上。
    火车开动了。达尼洛夫钻到车里了。琳娜故意站在路基上等着。车轮下的热风，往她的光腿上吹来。当最后一辆车走到她跟前的时候，她抓住栏杆，轻轻儿一跳，就登到比她膝盖高的脚踏板上了。她站到脚踏板上自喜起来——她跳得多敏捷，她多有力气，迎面的风，吹着额和胸，多么畅快呵……“你瞧瞧吧，达同志，”她笑着说，“瞧我是怎样一个……”于是叫他饱饱的对自己叹赏一番，就进到车里了。
    第三章　比洛夫医生
    救护列车在列宁格勒停到威吉普斯克车辆调配站上。答应过半小时就给拨车头的；可是两小时过去了，还不见车头。比洛夫医生在司令车附近来回踱着，嘟囔着说：
    “这真糟极了……”
    这话并不是指停车讲的。医生曾给太太打电报，说路过列宁格勒，请她到车站上来。可是叫他们的车停到那一个站上，这件事直到今天早晨以前，连他自己也不晓得。现在没看见她。这真糟极了。主要的或许她已经在这儿呢，在这灼热的、轨道纵横的地上徘徊着找他呢。而这儿有几十辆车头，几千辆车厢。给他们一拨到车头就开车了，她来不及找着他呢。医生在难受着。几次他都想着到列车中间去找一找她。有一次，他已经离开了司令车。可是他怕起来：他不在，车突然开了怎么好呢？当然可以赶去。可是达尼洛夫会说什么话呢？医生有点怕达尼洛夫呢。
    达尼洛夫对他打着招呼，由跟前过去：他今天还没同司令见面的。从早晨起，就开党会，选举党的组织员。选举了尤丽，达尼洛夫也是投她的票，因为没人可选呢，可是现在他却怀疑起来了。虽然她有着一切男子的气概，可是究竟是个女子。而组织员将来跟比洛夫医生的麻烦可多得很呢。达尼洛夫心里把问题这样的处理着：应该叫比洛夫担任列车司令。可是女子的弱手腕，怎么能经得起这样的事呢……
    达尼洛夫对他打着招呼，心里怜惜起他来。医生穿着制服，在太阳地里散着步。他外衣胸前的口袋鼓着，好象一块四四方方的生铁似的；他往里边装的什么呢？光亮的帽徽下，他的高鼻子也发着光。汗从鼻子两边流下来。医生被晒得象炎阳下的房顶那么热。
    “真热！”达尼洛夫说着。
    “不提了，”医生回答着。“你晓得，隔着鞋底都觉得砂石多么热呵。”
    达尼洛夫细心的朝脚下看了一眼：他不晓得这叫砂石；他喜欢知道这类东西。老知识分子们，从来总是会告诉一些东西的。
    “他们把我们停到那儿来了？”医生继续说。“这好象是铁路边的森林沼泽地带似的，我是一个老列宁格勒，可是我就不知道这些地方。”
    达尼洛夫没回答；无论停在那儿，不都是一个样吗？主要的是向目的地开去开回来。他不知道医生为什么苦恼，他也不知道医生真要象小孩子似的哭起来了。
