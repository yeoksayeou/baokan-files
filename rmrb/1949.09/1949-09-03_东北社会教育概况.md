Editor's Note: In the past, old liberated areas had a set of experiences in educating farmers. However, since the liberation of many cities, how to educate citizens and workers, and how to develop social education, are new issues. This article introduces social education in Northeast China, especially worker education, which is worth referring to by other regions.

I. Mass Cultural and Recreational Activities

Regarding the overview of social education in Northeast China, I will briefly introduce it to the readers based on some materials I know personally. Since a comprehensive summary has not yet been conducted in this regard, I shall be personally responsible for any inappropriate statements.

In the past, social education in Northeast China was far less developed than school education. During the puppet Manchukuo period, only some civic education centers, libraries, and public schools were established in large and medium-sized cities. From August 15th to 1947, our focus was on supporting the war and carrying out land reform. Apart from work teams and district and village cadres conducting current affairs, policy, and class education to the broad masses of people through actual struggles, we did not have the full capacity to carry out cultural education for literacy. However, at that time, we had already begun to establish civic education centers, reform old artists, create blackboard newspapers, and organize literacy classes in large and medium-sized cities such as Harbin, Qiqihar, Mudanjiang, and Jiamusi. The main targets were ordinary citizens, but the results were not significant. The cultural education of the working class and peasants had not yet attracted widespread attention.

In August 1948, it was proposed at the Third Northeast Education Conference that social education work should be carried out with a focus on large and medium-sized cities, with workers as the main target. Secondly, winter school movements should be launched during the slack farming season. After that, it attracted attention from all regions. In the same winter, provinces began to establish winter schools. According to preliminary statistics, a total of 30,762 winter schools were established in the provinces, with 32,699 winter school teachers (mostly primary school teachers), and 1,232,299 students enrolled. According to statistics from Songjiang Province, poor peasants, farm laborers and middle peasants accounted for 92.5 percent of the students. The teaching materials used were farmers' almanacs, production textbooks, couplets, party member textbooks, "Turning Over" songs, and newspapers. Some implemented "learn what you do." When building political power, they taught about people's congresses and civil rights; when building the party, they taught party member textbooks; some compiled the surnames of the villages into "catchy rhymes," so that names would be recognized, which would be helpful for production teams to record work points in the future. Most of the winter schools were successful. For example, illiterates participating in the study in Songjiang Province could recognize more than 150 characters. The shortcomings were that the leadership did not pay enough attention, the handling time was too short (20 days to one month), and there was a lack of unified and applicable teaching materials. After the winter schools ended, some of the well-run ones were transformed into regular evening literacy classes. According to incomplete statistics from Jilin Province alone, there were about 291 places. After the spring plowing this year, rural primary schools in various provinces began to run literacy classes and newspaper reading groups. According to incomplete statistics from Rehe Province, about 49,494 people participated in the study, accounting for 1.1 percent of the province's population; about 325,610 people participated in the study in Jilin Province, accounting for about 8 percent of the province's population. Most of the students are women and children, and fewer young and adults. The vast majority are poor peasants, farm laborers and middle peasants. There is currently a lack of materials from Northeast China, and it is estimated that the number should not be less than that of winter schools. The teaching materials are the same as those used in winter schools. The classes are mostly taught for one or two hours at noon or in the evening. At present, due to the lack of clear guidelines, plans, and systems in rural social education work in various places, and weak leadership, most of them are in a state of intermittent operation, with little practical effect and formality. In addition, this year's Spring Festival mass cultural activities in Northeast China were very active. At that time, it coincided with the liberation of Peiping (Beijing) and Tianjin (Tientsin), and various places organized yangko teams to carry out victory celebration propaganda. The content was mostly: workers and peasants overturning their lives, women's liberation, development of production, exposing the Kuomintang reactionaries' false peace conspiracies, supporting Chairman Mao's Eight Peace Terms, publicizing the great victory of the Liberation War, carrying the revolution through to the end, etc. Many people participated. For example, there were as many as 6,000 people in Zhaoning County, Heilongjiang Province. In Boli County, 210 administrative villages organized 101 yangko teams. Almost every large village had a yangko team. Cities were also enthusiastic. Women accounted for half of the stilt team in the second district of Jiamusi City. Auntie Tian, 46 years old, from Didao Street, was very happy to see the young people dancing. She went back and found Old Auntie Xiao to dress up as an old couple and started dancing when they went out. It is estimated that there are thousands of yangko teams and hundreds of thousands of participants in Northeast China. This is a new atmosphere in the countryside after land reform and the liberated cities. However, there are also shortcomings: poor leadership and lack of unification. Except for the Propaganda Department of the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee, which paid attention to summarizing, no such experience summaries have been seen in general!

II. Worker Education

Northeast China paid attention to worker education earlier. From the autumn of 1946 to the period of the Xinhua News Agency's "February 7th" editorial in 1948, due to the unstable situation and the blind orthodox views of workers, coupled with the impact of rural land reform, worker education was mainly conducted by work teams in various places through large-scale short-term training classes, giving large lectures, conducting "three investigations and three rectifications," and launching movements to confess and pour out grievances, and conducting current affairs, policy, and class education. From the publication of the "February 7th" editorial to March 10th of this year, before the Northeast Bureau Political Committee issued the "Instructions on Launching Political and Cultural Education for Workers and Masses," during this period, due to the victorious development of the situation, the restoration and development of industrial production, and the need to universally establish trade unions, education on the basic issues of the Chinese revolution and the Chinese Communist Party was conducted for workers, and small-scale political training classes and specialized training classes in literature, art, labor protection, and technology were organized. At the same time, attention was also paid to running evening schools for workers' spare-time cultural education. From March 10th of this year to the present, since the Northeast Bureau Political Committee has already issued clear instructions, in order to develop production, various places are enthusiastically launching worker production competitions, implementing cost accounting and democratic factory management movements. Therefore, workers in various places universally demand to improve their cultural and technical levels. During this period, the content of worker education has shifted from focusing on political training to focusing on improving culture and technology (but it does not mean that political education can be neglected, but that it should be carried out through culture and technology and in combination with them); the educational form has also changed from irregular short-term training classes to more regular spare-time worker evening schools. Worker education has been successful in the past three years, mainly in politically enlightening the class consciousness of workers, and cultivating a large number of cadres and activists. It is estimated that there are about 100,000 trade union and production team leaders who have been trained in Northeast China, laying a good foundation for the establishment of people's enterprises.

Now worker education has considerable development in quantity. According to the statistics of the Cultural and Educational Department of the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions on July 14th, among the 1,117,202 workers in Northeast China, 325,957 people have participated in the study, accounting for 29.1 percent of the total number of workers. Among them, 133,091 people participated in worker evening school studies, accounting for 40.8 percent of the total number of students (the same below); 89,346 people participated in worker literacy classes, accounting for 27.4 percent; the two together accounted for 68.2 percent; all focusing on cultural education. 66,446 people participated in political training classes, accounting for 20.4 percent; 19,938 people participated in technical training classes, accounting for 6.1 percent; and 522 people participated in literary and artistic training classes, accounting for 0.2 percent. The above-mentioned worker education activities are mostly in the process of exploration and trial implementation. Among them, the Workers' Joint Evening School in Xifujia District, Harbin City, has achieved better results. The school divides workers into grades one, two, three, four, five, and six according to their cultural level. More than 1,200 people are divided into 23 classes. The study period for each grade is four months. Classes are held from 6 to 8 pm on Mondays and Wednesdays. Workers' meetings and political activities are scheduled for Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. Study and meetings do not interfere with each other. Grades one, two, and three have Chinese and arithmetic, grade four and above add common sense, and grade six adds drafting technology courses. A set of textbooks has been compiled by the Harbin Federation of Trade Unions. Primary and secondary school teachers are responsible for teaching, and there is a certain amount of remuneration (about two work points per hour). Illiterates first enter the first grade. After completing the one-year course and passing the examination, they are promoted to the second grade. In this way, an illiterate worker can complete all the courses of the six grades in two years, and can roughly reach the level of senior elementary school. This kind of regular spare-time worker evening school, which focuses on cultural education and supplements technical and political education, is very popular among the majority of workers. It is a better form explored in the three years of worker education work in Harbin City. It can be promoted to various places. Dalian's worker technical education is also very successful. But generally speaking, only a few worker education programs in Northeast China are as good as the Workers' Joint Evening School in Xifujia District, Harbin City. In general, there are still problems such as excessive political content in the education, insufficient attention to culture and technology, insufficient emphasis on employee education, and unresolved problems such as teaching materials, supplies, time, and funding, and weak ideological and organizational leadership. Attention has recently begun to be paid to research and solutions.

III. Civic Education

Education for ordinary citizens is mainly carried out through cultural centers. According to incomplete statistics, there are a total of 119 cultural centers and 39 libraries in Northeast China, with approximately 600 employees. About two-thirds of the cultural centers and libraries are concentrated in large and medium-sized cities with a population of more than 100,000, and one-third are distributed in ordinary towns. There are 3,432 public night schools run by cultural centers, with 75,433 students (mostly independent laborers, shop assistants, and housewives), 96 worker night schools, with 7,336 students (mostly handicraft workers), and 11 youth supplementary classes in cities such as Harbin, Shenyang, and Anshan, with 745 students, mostly out-of-school and unemployed youth. In addition, cultural centers also handle book reading, writing services, social services, street broadcasting, literary and artistic propaganda, blackboard newspapers, and other tasks. According to our investigation, the Cultural Center of Beifujia District in Harbin City is larger in scale and has achieved results. It currently has 14 employees and 2 workers. Since its establishment two years ago, the museum has successively led more than 350 shop assistants to study, and run a supplementary school with a total of 412 students. Among them, 258 students have been promoted to schools or participated in work after receiving education. Operated women's literacy classes with 130 students, village head training classes with 70 students, summer supplementary classes with 40 students, and also ran eight worker night schools this year with 460 students. The above-mentioned mass supplementary education mainly teaches cultural courses, supplemented by current affairs and policy education, and has yielded gains. In addition, the museum also has a reading room with 23 types of books, 2,227 volumes, 698 paintings, and dozens of newspapers and magazines, with an average of about 700 readers or viewers per day. Social services (copying, consultation, introduction, etc.) helped ordinary citizens handle 7,387 items. In the past five months of this year, it has organized 21 citizen entertainment evenings, published 80 editions of blackboard newspapers, 31 issues of window newspapers, and 100 microphone broadcasts. Radio broadcasts were made twice, in coordination with the center of municipal work, and current affairs and policy education was conducted, which yielded great results. Although the museum has shortcomings such as unclear guidelines and tasks from the leadership, doing whatever it encounters, being busy with daily affairs, and failing to summarize experience in a timely manner, it is undeniable that the museum has become the cultural and entertainment center of the district's citizens. The public night school in Dalian City is also well-run. More than 30,000 people in the city have enrolled, accounting for more than 60% of the city's more than 50,000 illiterate people. More than 95% of the students regularly attend classes. The night school in the city is run by neighborhood political cadres, and middle school students and general educated youths in the neighborhood are hired to teach without remuneration. The time is mostly from 6 to 8 pm, with 1,000 characters as the standard. After reading the textbook and passing the exam, a cultural certificate is issued to prove that he is not illiterate. The city plans to eliminate illiteracy within two years. Literacy education has now become a mass movement. Xin'an Primary School in Andong City mobilized senior students from the entire school to become small teachers, organizing more than 1,000 out-of-school children to study and teach them the lessons they learned in school, implementing Mr. Tao Xingzhi's advocacy of "knowing and spreading to others immediately." If every primary school in Northeast China could do this, then more than 2.34 million out-of-school children could be educated.

In short, among the current social education work in Northeast China, worker education has achieved greater results, with the number of people receiving education accounting for 29.1%, followed by farmer education, with the number of people receiving education accounting for 1% to 8%, and civic education is generally poor except for the Lushun and Dalian areas.

Now, in order to further improve social education in Northeast China, the following three major problems must be solved: (1) Efforts should be made to formulate unified guidelines, tasks, plans, and a set of regular systems, regulations, and ordinances for social education in Northeast China; (2) Efforts should be made to compile and select a set of textbooks suitable for workers, peasants, and citizens; (3) Efforts should be made to cultivate a group of social education administrative cadres, and organize and mobilize teachers and students of primary and secondary schools to participate in social education work. Although there are also some problems with social education funding, they are easier to solve than the above-mentioned problems. The Northeast Education Department is already working on research and will soon convene the Fourth Northeast Education Conference to discuss these issues. We hope to achieve satisfactory results.

　　东北社会教育概况
    张健
    编者按：过去老解放区对农民的教育，是有一套经验的，但是，自从许多城市解放后，对于市民和职工如何进行教育，又如何发展社会教育，均是新的问题，本文介绍了东北的社会教育，特别是职工教育值得各地参考。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    一、群众文娱工作
    关于东北社会教育概况，根据我个人所知的一些材料，简略的向读者介绍一下。因这方面尚未进行全面总结，如有些问题说得不妥之处，当由笔者个人负责。
    过去东北的社会教育，远不如学校教育发达，伪满时仅在大中城市设些民教馆，图书馆，民众学校而已。从“八一五”到一九四七年间，我们因工作重点是支援战争和进行土地改革，除了工作队、区村干部，经过实际斗争向广大人民进行时事政策及阶级教育外，对读书识字的文化教育工作未及全力进行。但那时在哈尔滨、齐齐哈尔、牡丹江、佳木斯等大中城市，已开始着手建立民教馆，改造旧艺人，办黑板报，识字班了，主要对象是一般市民，不过成绩不算大。工农大众的文化教育尚未引起普遍注意。
    一九四八年八月间，在东北第三次教育会议上提出：要有重点的先在大中城市开展社会教育工作，以工人为主要对象，其次利用农闲季节开展冬学运动，此后，才引起各地注意。同年冬季各省开始创办冬学，据初步统计，各省共办冬学三○、七六二处，冬学教师三二、六九九人（多半是小学教员），入学人数一、二三二、二九九名。据松江省统计，学员中贫雇农、中农共占百分之九二·五。教材用农家历、生产课本、对联、党员课本、翻身乐及报纸等，有的实行“做什么，学什么。”建政就讲人民代表会租公民权，建党就讲党员课本；有的将本村姓氏编成“顺口溜”，姓名会认了，将来生产小组好记工帐。大部分冬学是有成绩的，例如松江省参加学习的文盲，都能认一百五十字以上。缺点是领导上注意不够，办理时间太短（二十天至一个月），缺少统一适用的教材。冬学结束后，有些办得好的就转变成平时的夜校识字班，仅据吉林省不完全统计约有二九一处。今年春耕后各省农村小学又开始办理识字班，读报组，据热河省不完全统计：参加学习的约有四九、四九四人，占全省人口百分之一点一；吉林省参加学习的约有三二五、六一○人，占全省人口百分之八左右。学员中妇女儿童居多，青年、成年较少，绝大部分都是贫雇农和中农。现缺全东北材料，估计其数量当不少于冬学。教材和冬学一样，时间多半在午间或晚上教一两点钟的课。目前各地农村社教工作，由于缺乏明确的方针、计划、制度，领导又弱，故多数是处在时办时停状态中，实际成效不大，流于形式。再有，今年东北春节群众文艺活动很活跃。当时正逢平津解放，各地都组织秧歌队，进行祝捷宣传，内容多半是：工农翻身、妇女解放、发展生产、揭露国民党反动派假和平阴谋，拥护毛主席八项和平条件、宣传解放战争伟大胜利、将革命进行到底等等。参加人数很多，如合江省雉宁县有六千人之多，勃利县二百一十个行政村，就组织了一百零一个秧歌队，差不多大村庄都有秧歌队。城市也很热烈，佳木斯市二区的高跷队，妇女占一半，滴道街四十六岁的老田太太，看到青年人扭的挺高兴，回去就找老肖太太化装成老夫妇俩，出门就扭起来。估计全东北约有数千队秧歌，几十万人参加，这是土地改革后的农村，解放了的城市底新气象。但也存在着缺点：领导差，不统一，除合江省委宣传部注意总结外，一般还没见到这类的经验总结！
    二、职工教育
    东北职工教育注意的较早，自一九四六年秋至一九四八年新华社“二七”社论时期内，由于时局不稳定，职工存在着盲目正统观念，加上受农村土地改革影响，职工教育主要的是由各地工作队办大型短训班，上大课，搞三查三整，坦白诉苦运动，进行时事政策及阶级教育。从“二七”社论发表后至今年三月十日东北局政委会发出：“关于开展工人群众政治文化教育指示”以前，这一时期由于时局胜利发展，恢复和发展了工业生产，要普遍建立工会，就向工人进行关于中国革命基本问题和中国共产党的教育，多办小型政治训练班及文艺、劳保组织、技术等专门训练班。同时，也开始注意办理职工业余文化教育的夜校。从今年三月十日到现在，由于东北局政委会已有明确指示，为着发展生产，各地正在热烈地开展职工生产竞赛，实行成本核算和工厂管理民主化运动，故各地职工普遍要求提高自己的文化技术水平，这时期职工教育内容，就由以政治训练为主转变为以提高文化技术为主（但不是说可以疏忽政治教育，而使它通过文化技术并和其结合一起进行）；教育形式也由不正规的短训班转变为较正规的业余职工夜校。三年来职工教育是有成绩的，主要是在政治上启发了职工阶级觉悟，培养了大批干部和积极分子，估计全东北经过训练的工会和生产小组长以上的约有十万人左右，打下了建立人民企业的良好基础。
    现在职工教育在数量上有相当的发展，据东北总工会文教部七月十四日统计：全东北在一、一一七、二○二职工中，已有三二五、九五七人参加学习，占职工总数百分之二十九点一。其中参加职工夜校学习的一三三、○九一人，占学习总人数（下同）百分之四十点八；参加职工识字班的八九、三四六人，占百分之二十七点四；二者共占百分之六十八点二；皆以文化教育为主。参加政治训练班的六六、四四六人，占百分之二十点四；参加技术训练班的一九、九三八人，占百分之六点一；参加文艺训练班的五二二人，占百分之零点二。上述职工教育活动大都在摸索试办过程中，其中以哈尔滨市西傅家区工人联合夜校办理得较有成绩，该校根据工人文化程度分成一、二、三、四、五、六年级，一千二百余人分编成二十三个班，每年级学习期限是四个月，每星期一、三下午六至八时上课，职工会议及政治活动时间规定在星期二、四、六，学习与开会互不耽误，一、二、三年级设有国语、算术，四年以上增设常识，六年级酌设制图技术课，已由哈尔滨市总工会编成一套课本教材。由中小学教师负责教课，并有一定报酬（一小时约有二工薪分左右）。文盲先入一年级，学完一年课程考试及格后，再升入二年级，这样一个文盲工友经过两年的时间，就可以学完六个年级的全部课程，大致可以达到高小的程度。这种以文化教育为主，以技术政治教育为辅的正规职工业余夜校，颇受广大职工欢迎，它是哈尔滨市三年来职工教育工作中摸索到较好的形式。颇可以向各地推广。大连市的职工技术教育，也办得很有成绩。但总的说起来，东北职工教育象哈尔滨市西傅家区工人联合夜校办得一样好的还是少数。一般的仍存在着教育内容上政治分量过重，文化技术注意不够，对职员教育重视不够，对教材、物资、时间、经费等问题，尚未很好解决，思想和组织领导较弱等毛病，近来已开始注意研究解决。
    三、市民教育
    对一般市民教育主要是通过文化馆去进行的。全东北据不完全统计，共有一百一十九处文化馆，三十九处图书馆，职员约有六百余名。文化馆图书馆约有三分之二是集中在十万人口以上之大中城市里，三分之一分布在普通城镇上。由文化馆办理的民众夜校三、四三二处，学生七五、四三三人（以一般独立劳动者店员家庭妇女居多），工人夜校九十六处，学生七、三三六人（以手工业工人居多），哈尔滨、沈阳、鞍山等市尚办青年补习班十一处，学生七四五人，多为失学失业的青年。此外，文化馆尚办理图书阅览、代笔问事、社会服务、街头广播、文艺宣传、黑板报等工作。据我们调查所知，其中以哈尔滨市北傅家区文化馆规模较大，办理得也有成绩，现有职员十四名，工友两名。该馆自创办至今两年来，先后曾领导三百五十余名店员学习，办理补习学校一处，共有学员四一二名，其中经过教育后升学或参加工作者计有二五八名。办妇女识字班，学员一三○名，闾长训练班，学员七○名，暑期补习班，学员四○名，参加街上办冬学，今年又办八处职工夜校，学员四六○名，上述群众补习教育皆以教文化课为主，辅以时事政策教育，尚有收获。此外，该馆尚有阅览室一处，现有图书二十三种、二、二二七册，画片六九八幅，报纸杂志数十种，平均每天读者或观众七百人左右。社会服务（代书、问事、介绍等）帮助一般市民办理了七、三八七件。今年五个月中就组织过二十一次市民娱乐晚会，黑板报出了八十版，窗报出了三十一期，麦克风广播一百次，电台广播两次，配合着市政工作中心，进行时事政策教育，收获很大。该馆虽因领导上方针任务还不很明确，遇到什么做什么，忙于日常事务，未及时总结经验等缺点，但不可否认该馆已成为该区市民文化娱乐的中心。大连市民众夜校也办得很好，全市已有三万余人入学，占全市五万余文盲的百分之六十以上，学员经常上课者在百分之九十五以上。该市夜校是由街坊政权干部负责办理，聘请中学生和街坊上一般知识青年教课，无报酬，时间大都在晚上六至八时，以认识一千字为标准，读完课本考试及格，就发文化证，证明他是非文盲。该市预定两年内扫除文盲。识字教育现已成为群众运动。安东市新安小学，发动全校高年级学生当小先生，组织一千余名失学儿童学习，将自己在校内所学的功课教给他们，实行陶行知先生所提倡的“即知即传人”。若东北每个小学都能如此做的话，那么二百三十四万余失学儿童都可能受到教育。
    总之，目前东北社会教育工作中，以职工教育成绩较大，受教人数占百分之廿九点一，农民教育次之，受教人数占百分之一至百分之八，市民教育除旅顺大连地区外，一般都较差。
    现在东北社会教育要继续提高一步，必须解决下列三大问题：（一）应设法制定全东北社会教育统一的方针、任务、计划，和一套正规的制度、法规、条例；（二）应设法编选一套适用于职工的、农民的、市民的课本教材；（三）应设法培养一批社会教育行政干部，和组织动员中小学校师生来参加社会教育工作。社教经费虽也有些问题，但比之上述问题还是容易解决的。现在东北教育部已在着手研究中，不久将召开东北四次教育会议讨论这些问题，我们希望能得到圆满的结果。
