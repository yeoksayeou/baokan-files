　　Shijiazhuang Trading Company Reorganized
  　Establishment of Various Specialized Companies
  　Divided by Business Nature into Three Categories: Inland, Export, and Import
    [Shijiazhuang News] Our city's trading company has been ordered to close, and new specialized branches and retail departments have been established on the existing foundation under the direct leadership of higher authorities. These specialized companies were established in response to the needs of the revolutionary situation to actively develop industrial and agricultural production and strengthen import and export trade. The city's branch companies are divided into three categories: inland, export, and import. Inland companies include grain, cotton yarn, and general merchandise. Export companies include native produce, oils and fats, eggs, and bristles. Import companies include hardware and machinery, and chemicals and pharmaceuticals. The city's oils and fats, and hardware and machinery companies are branch companies. Chemicals and pharmaceuticals are set up as retail departments, while the rest are branch companies. Currently, with the exception of the egg, bristle, and oils and fats companies, which are still under preparation, the rest have been prepared and will be formally announced for reorganization and opening soon.
    In addition, to ensure the supply of daily necessities for all municipal organizations, factories, and schools, a general supply store will be established and is currently being actively prepared. After the store is established, the city's cooperative work can focus on organizing production and further promoting cooperative enterprises.
