　　Combat Hero Wei Xiaotang, Awarded Eight Meritorious Services and Two Special-Class Merits
    Shen Yukke
    On the morning of the 22nd, the reporter interviewed Comrade Wei Xiaotang, a combat hero of the Second Field Army. He is a 23-year-old youth who has been awarded eight meritorious services and two special-class merits. Before joining the army, he herded cattle and sheep for landlords. Now, he is not only a CPPCC representative but also one of the chairmen of the conference presidium.

    After explaining my purpose, I first asked him, "You must have been very happy when you received the notice to attend this meeting?"

    He said, "The feeling in my heart at that time, I really didn't know how to express it. On the one hand, I wanted to come, and on the other hand, I didn't want to come. Why didn't I want to come? Because I was wounded before the end of the Huaihai Campaign. Until the battles of crossing the Yangtze River and liberating Nanjing, Shanghai, and Nanchang, our company never had a chance to fight heartily. Therefore, during the advance to the southwest, I swore several times in front of the company, determined to complete the task and strive to make contributions in this final battle to eliminate the Chiang bandits. But I said it empty-mouthed several times, and the plan could never be realized, so I felt ashamed."

    "Why did you want to come then?" He continued, "I was a poor child since I was little, suffering from cold and hunger, herding cattle and sheep for others. If it were in the era of Kuomintang rule, let alone participating in the Political Consultative Conference, I probably wouldn't even be able to be a village head. Since I have the opportunity to participate in such a founding conference, it is a great honor, so I really wanted to come. Finally, the political director also persuaded me, and my comrades also persuaded me, saying, 'Xiaotang, go! See Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu! When you come back from the meeting, there will be opportunities for you to contribute!' I thought, okay, this is also a combat mission, I will study hard, bring the resolutions of the conference to everyone in their original form, and resolutely implement them with everyone!"

    When the reporter mentioned Chairman Mao, he expressed sincere love and support for this great people's leader. He said, "This time I saw Chairman Mao with my own eyes, and he is exactly the same as in the photos." Then he told me: When he was about to leave, every soldier said, "Xiaotang, say hello to Chairman Mao for me!" "Send greetings to Commander-in-Chief Zhu!" Some said, "When you see Chairman Mao, ask him to give us combat missions, and we guarantee to complete them 100%." Some literate people even wrote letters of greetings to Chairman Mao in their own handwriting. When he came, he brought more than twenty such letters.

    Regarding the birth of the People's Republic of China, he believes that this is the result of the arduous struggle of the people and the People's Liberation Army under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. He said, "It's really not easy! After more than twenty years of hard fighting, we have what we have today." His words are correct. Take him as an example! He joined the army at the age of nineteen, and was wounded five times in five years of combat. In one of them, a bullet entered his right cheek and came out of his mouth, leaving a clear scar on his fair face. Then he said indignantly, "The new China is like a flower. This flower is nurtured by our blood and sweat. Since we have nurtured it with blood and sweat, we must protect it with blood and sweat. If anyone dares to invade it, we will eliminate them like we eliminated Chiang Kai-shek!"

    Speaking of his personal achievements, he said sincerely and modestly, "This is not my own功劳, but the labor of the entire combat force. Can a single person win a battle?"

    He is from Henglin Village, Jincheng County, Shanxi Province. Since joining the army in 1945, he has participated in the famous Jinan, Luoyang, Huaihai, Yangtze River Crossing, and Nanchang Liberation campaigns. In every battle, he truly served as a model of charging forward and retreating last. For example, in the battle to liberate Jia County, Henan, he, as a communication soldier, captured more than twenty enemies alone. When the street fighting was intense, the enemy blocked the street entrance. The infantry company charged twice, but was stopped by the enemy. Blasting and shelling also failed. At that time, he was not assigned a combat mission, but he took the initiative and cleverly rushed to the vicinity of the enemy's fortifications, defeated the enemy, and played an important role in resolving the battle. Because of his infinite loyalty to the revolution, he was promoted from soldier, communication soldier, squad leader, platoon leader, deputy company commander to the current company political instructor.

　　立过八次大功两次特等功的
  　战斗英雄卫小堂
    沈毓珂
    二十二日上午，记者访问了第二野战军战斗英雄卫小堂同志。这是一个立过八次大功和两次特等功的二十三岁的青年。未参军前他给地主放牛牧羊，现在他不但是政协代表，而且是大会主席团主席之一。
    说明来意后，记者首先问他：“你接到参加这个会的通知后，一定很高兴吧？”
    他说：“当时心里的滋味，真不知道怎样说才好。一方面想来，一方面又不想来。为什不想来呢？因为在淮海战役还没结束的时候，我就负伤了，直到过长江解放南京、上海、南昌诸战役，我们那个连，始终没有痛痛快快的打个仗，所以这次向西南大进军时，我曾几次在连队前宣誓，决心完成任务，争取在这最后消灭蒋匪的战役中立功。可是空口白说了好几次，计划老不能实现，因此心里感觉到惭愧。”
    “为什么又想来呢？”他接着说：“我自小是个穷孩子，受冻挨饿，给人家放牛放羊，如果在国民党统治时代，不用说参加政治协商会议，恐怕连个村长也当不上，既然有机会参加这样开国的大会，真是天大地大的光荣，所以又很想来。最后政治主任也劝我，战友们也劝我，都说：‘小堂，去吧！看看毛主席和朱总司令！等你开会回来，有你出力的机会！’我想，也好，这也是个战斗任务，我一定好好学习，把大会决议，源源本本的带给大家，并和大家坚决执行！”
    当记者提到毛主席时，他对这位伟大的人民领袖，表现着赤诚的热爱与拥护，他说：“这次亲眼看到了毛主席，和照片上一模一样。”接着他又告诉我：他临来的时候，每个战士都说：“小堂，替我问毛主席好！”“问候朱总司令好！”有的说：“见了毛主席时，让他给我们战斗任务，我们保证百分之百的完成。”有些识字的人，并亲笔给毛主席写了问候的信。他来的时候，就带着二十多封这样的信。
    对于中华人民共和国的诞生，他认为这是全国人民和解放军在共产党毛主席领导下艰苦奋斗的结果，他说：“真不容易啊！苦战了二十多年，才有今天这个样子。”他的话是对的，就拿他来说吧！他十九岁参军，五年战斗中负伤五次，其中一次，子弹从右腮打进去，从口内穿出来，伤痕鲜明的留在他白净的脸上。接着他愤慨地说：“新中国好比一朵花，这朵花是用我们的血和汗养大的，我们既然用血汗养大它，我们就要用血汗保卫它，谁要是敢于向它进犯，我们也要象消灭蒋介石一样把它消灭掉！”
    说到他个人的功绩时，他诚挚而谦逊地说：“这也不是我一个人的功劳，而是全战斗部队的劳动，单人独马还能打胜仗吗？”
    他是山西晋城县横林村人，自一九四五年入伍到现在，曾参加过有名的晋南、洛阳、淮海、过长江、解放南昌诸战役，每次战斗中，他真正做到了冲锋在前，退却在后的模范。如解放河南郏县战斗中，他以一个通讯员的资格，一人俘敌二十余名。当巷战正激烈时，敌人将街口封锁，步兵连冲两次，均被敌人阻止，爆破、炮轰也未成功，当时并未担任战斗任务的他，主动而巧妙的冲至敌人工事附近，击溃敌人，给解决这次战斗起了重要的作用。就因他这样的对革命的无限忠诚，所以他由战士、通讯员、班长、排长、副连长，被提拔为现任之连队指导员。
