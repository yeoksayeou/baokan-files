　　Romanian Working People
  　Enthusiastically Discuss the Five-Year Plan
    Milled Iron and Steel Production Will Reach 2.25 Million Tons by the End of 1955
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 18th] TASS Bucharest dispatch: The Romanian people are enthusiastically discussing the first Five-Year Plan, which unfolds a broad prospect for the country. Spark (Iskra) newspaper reported: The Romanian working people are carefully studying the moving figures of the country's first Five-Year Plan, which was announced by George Dej, General Secretary of the Romanian Workers' Party, at the celebration commemorating National Day on August 23 this year.
    The first Five-Year Plan stipulates that by 1955—the last year of the first Five-Year Plan—Romania will produce one million tons of milled iron and one million two hundred and fifty thousand tons of steel, whereas between 1925 and 1935, Romania's average annual production of milled iron did not exceed 50,000 tons, and the average annual production of steel did not exceed 100,000 tons. By 1955, coal production will reach 8 million tons annually, which is four times that of 1925-1935, and coking coal production will increase seven to nine times, reaching 700,000 tons annually. Within three years, oil production will reach pre-war levels. The increase in the output of heavy industry and mining industry will create huge possibilities for the development of manufacturing. In the next five years, the output of machinery will double. The output of agricultural machinery and chemical fertilizers will also be greatly increased. Six thousand tractors will be produced annually. By the end of 1955, the country will have 25,000 tractors.
    　　　　National Electrification
    　　Will Establish Several Hydropower Stations with 2 Million Kilowatts of Electricity
    The substantial increase in the production of agricultural machinery will ensure a high level of agricultural mechanization, increase agricultural productivity, and create the necessary material conditions for the socialist transformation of Romania's agriculture. The Five-Year Plan will solve one of the most important tasks put forward by the Romanian Communist Party National Conference in 1945, namely, national electrification. Within five or six years, Romania will build several hydropower stations with a total power of 2 million kilowatts. In Romania during the bourgeois and landlord rule, the power of the power stations was only 600,000 kilowatts, and the number of people using electricity in rural areas did not exceed 6% of the total population. As a result of electrification, every village in Romania will have electricity supply.
    The Five-Year Plan stipulates a substantial increase in national income and an improvement in the people's living standards. By 1955, the national income will double compared with 1949, and the living standards of the working people will increase by 80% compared with 1949.

　　罗马尼亚劳动人民
  　热烈讨论五年计划
    一九五五年终铣铁和钢铁生产将达二百二十五万吨
    【新华社北平十八日电】塔斯社布加勒斯特讯：罗马尼亚人民正在热烈讨论为该国展开一个广大远景的第一个五年计划。火花报报道：罗马尼亚劳动人民细心研究该国第一个五年计划的动人数字，这个计划是罗马尼亚工人党总书记乔治·德治于今年八月二十三日举行国庆日纪念的庆祝会上所宣布的。
    第一个五年计划规定：到一九五五年——第一个五年计划最后一年，罗马尼亚将生产一百万吨铣铁和一百二十五万吨钢，而在一九二五到一九三五年间，罗马尼亚平均每年生产的铣铁未超过五万吨，平均每年生产的钢未超过十万吨。到一九五五年，煤产每年将达八百万吨，即为一九二五——一九三五年间的四倍，焦煤产量将增加七至九倍，每年将达七十万吨。三年内，石油产量将达到战前水平。重工业和采矿工业产量的增加将为制造业的发展创造巨大的可能性。在今后五年内，机器的产量将增加一倍。农业机器和化学肥料的产量也要大大增加。每年将生产六千辆拖拉机。到一九五五年底，全国将拥有二万五千辆拖拉机。
    　　　　国家电气化
    　　将建立二百万千瓦电力的若干水电站
    农业机器生产的大大增加将保证农业机械化的高度水平，并提高农业生产率，给罗马尼亚的农业进行社会主义的改造创造先决物质条件。五年计划将解决一九四五年罗国共产党全国代表会议上所提出的最重要任务之一，即国家电气化。在五年或六年内，罗马尼亚将建设共有二百万千瓦电力的若干水电站。在资产阶级和地主统治时代的罗马尼亚电力站的电力只有六十万千瓦，农村用电的人数不超过全国人口的百分之六。由于电气化的结果，罗国的每一座村庄将获得电力供应。
    五年计划规定大大增加国民收入和提高人民生活水平。到一九五五年，国民收入将比一九四九年增加一倍，劳动人民的生活水平将较一九四九年增加百分之八十。
