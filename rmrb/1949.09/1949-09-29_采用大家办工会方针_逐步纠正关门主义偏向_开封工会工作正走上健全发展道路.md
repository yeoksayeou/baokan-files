Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng, 28th. Kaifeng City is gradually correcting the tendency of closed-doorism in trade union work and embarking on a path of sound development. At present, the city has developed 9,949 trade union members, accounting for 49.2% of the city's total number of workers. In terms of trade union organization, in addition to the preparatory committee of the city's Federation of Trade Unions, industrial trade union federations and preparatory committees for handicraft, shop employee, and porter industries have also been established; trade unions, trade union preparatory committees, or branch offices have also been established in various factories, workshops, and stores. There are currently 23 industrial trade union units, with more than 3,800 members, accounting for 62.2% of the total number of workers in the industry.

　　Kaifeng's trade union organizational work has taken many detours. From the liberation of Kaifeng in October of last year to February of this year, the puppet trade unions were disbanded, and the special agent leader Liu Huatang, chairman of the puppet trade union, was struggled against, and preliminary class education was carried out among the working masses. However, at this time, the leading organs in Kaifeng did not pay enough attention to trade union work, and the policy of the workers' movement was not clear. Trade union preparatory committees were only established in nine units such as post offices and railways, but even in these nine units, it was not possible to effectively educate workers and develop members through the trade union preparatory committees. In April of this year, after the spirit of the Second Plenary Session of the CPC Central Committee was conveyed, the leading organs in Kaifeng gradually clarified the idea of "relying on the working class," and Kaifeng's trade union organizational work made further progress; however, at this time, a serious tendency of closed-doorism was made in the development of members. Many leading cadres did not have enough political trust in the working masses, and did not clearly realize that the trade union is a mass organization of the working class, so they raised the membership conditions to a level close to that of party members. As for the methods and style of trade union work, there were rural viewpoints and bureaucracy, mechanically separating technicians and apprentices, workers and staff, and making the membership procedures very cumbersome. Therefore, by the end of April of this year, only 1,006 members had been developed in Kaifeng.

　　After May, the tendency of closed-doorism began to be corrected, and the preparatory committees for industrial trade unions, handicraft, porter, and shop employee industries were successively established, and the number of trade union members increased to more than 8,900, with new members accounting for nearly 90% of the total number of members. However, the closed-doorist tendency of the trade union has not been completely overcome, and most staff members are still kept outside the door. Of the 105 staff members in the Kaifeng Post Office, only a dozen are trade union members. Some units pay too much attention to the family background of workers, and some workers who have been working for more than ten years and earn their living by their own labor are kept outside the trade union door simply because they were born into landlord families. At the same time, due to simply paying attention to the development of members and forgetting or neglecting to carry out propaganda and education work among the workers, many trade union members still do not know what the trade union does long after joining the union.

　　Now the Kaifeng City Federation of Trade Unions has decided to adopt the policy of everyone running the trade union, consolidate the existing organization, prevent formalism and the tendency of closed-doorism, develop a large number of members, and strengthen class education for workers, so as to realize the instruction of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions on "basically organizing workers in about one year" and further advance Kaifeng's trade union work.

### 采用大家办工会方针　逐步纠正关门主义偏向  开封工会工作正走上健全发展道路

　　采用大家办工会方针
    逐步纠正关门主义偏向
    开封工会工作正走上健全发展道路
    【新华社开封二十八日电】开封市正在逐步纠正工会工作中的关门主义偏向，走上健全发展的道路。现在全市已发展工会会员九千九百四十九人，占全市工人总数百分之四十九点二。在工会组织方面，除全市总工会筹委会早已成立外，另又成立了产业职工联合会及手工、店员、搬运等业工会筹备会；各工厂、作坊、商店也已分别建立了工会、工会筹委会或支会。产业工会现共有二十三个单位，会员三千八百余人，占该业工人总数百分之六十二点二。开封的工会组织工作曾经走了不少弯路。从去年十月开封解放到今年二月这一阶段中，解散了伪工会，斗争了伪工会理事长特务头子刘华堂，初步在工人群众中进行了阶级教育。但这时开封的领导机关对于工会工作不够重视，工人运动的方针也不明确，只在邮局、铁路等九个单位建立了工会筹委会，但即在这九个单位中，也没有能够通过工会筹委会很好地教育工人和发展会员。今年四月间，在传达了中共二中全会的精神以后，开封的领导机关逐渐明确了“依靠工人阶级”的思想，开封的工会组织工作才有进一步的推进；但这时在发展会员上又犯了严重的关门主义偏向。不少领导干部在政治上对工人群众不够信任，又没有明确地认识到工会是工人阶级的群众组织，因而把会员条件提高到接近党员的水平。至于在工会工作方法和作风上，则存在着农村观点和官僚主义，机械地把技工与学徒、工人与职员分开，把入会手续规定得十分繁琐。所以到今年四月底，开封全市只发展了会员一千零六人。五月以后开始纠正关门主义的偏向，产业工会、手工、搬运、店员业工会筹委会先后成立，工会会员发展到八千九百余人，新会员占会员总数的百分之九十弱。但工会的关门主义偏向仍未完全克服，多数职员还被关在门外。开封邮局一百零五个职员中，只有十余个人是工会会员。有些单位对于工人的家庭成份过于重视，有些作工已十余年靠自己劳动收入为生的工人，单单因为出身地主家庭，便被关在工会大门之外。同时，由于单纯注意发展会员，而忘记或忽视了在工人中进行宣传教育工作，因此许多工会会员入会后很久还不知工会是做什么的。现开封市职工会决定采取大家办工会的方针，巩固现有组织，防止形式主义和关门主义的偏向，大量发展会员，加强对工人的阶级教育，以便实现全国总工会关于“在一年左右基本把工人组织起来”的指示，使开封的工会工作向前推进一步。
