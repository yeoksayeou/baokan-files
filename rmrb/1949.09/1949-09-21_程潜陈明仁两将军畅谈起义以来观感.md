Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 20th—General Cheng Qian, after arriving in Beiping and interacting with various parties, is very pleased. He specially expressed his feelings since the uprising to reporters, saying: "Everything I have witnessed in Changsha after its liberation, and this time on my way to Beiping via Wuhan—the discipline of the People's Liberation Army, the demeanor and style of the CCP cadres, the order of society—all fill me with great admiration. In an extremely backward society, and after twelve years of war, to be able to cultivate such a brand-new atmosphere from the ruins, to be able to carry out a thorough revolution so steadily, so methodically, and with such effort to preserve vitality, is truly unprecedented. This precisely demonstrates how great the power of the people is, and also due to the correct leadership of the CCP."

General Cheng believes that the Kuomintang reactionaries now have only a remnant of strength left, and will soon be thoroughly swept away by the torrent of the Chinese revolutionary people. He believes that it is completely impossible for bandits such as Jiang, Li, Yan, and Bai to rely on American aid and the fantasy of a third world war to save their fate. General Cheng said: "The amount of military supplies, money, and materials that American imperialism has sent to the Kuomintang reactionaries in the past is truly an astonishing number, but in three or four years, apart from waste and enrichment of the wealthy families, all have been transferred to the PLA. The reactionaries are getting weaker and weaker, and now only have a remnant of strength left, which is vulnerable to a single blow. Even if the United States supports them again, it will be useless." Regarding the issue of a third world war, General Cheng said: "The people of the whole world love peace. Only some war-mongers and the reactionaries of the Kuomintang, for their own personal interests, disregard the cruelty of war and use various methods to instigate war. But the forces that love peace are even stronger after the Second World War. Not only do the countries supporting peace unite with each other and try their best to oppose war, but also the anti-war sentiment of the people of the United States and Britain is rising day by day. The recent peace movement that has spread across the globe is an example. Moreover, the liberation of China, even if it fails to eliminate world war, has diluted the atmosphere of world war. The reactionaries' fantasies will ultimately be defeated by the peace-loving people of all countries."

General Cheng Qian Advocates
Developing Sun Yat-sen's Three Major Policies: Alliance with Soviet Union, Cooperation with the Communist Party, and Service to Workers and Peasants

General Cheng, in the capacity of a believer in the Three Principles of the People, put forward his future propositions. He said: "After the death of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the Kuomintang was controlled and manipulated by the reactionary bureaucratic groups headed by the four major families, and gradually embarked on the path of extreme counter-revolution. The new China is based on the worker-peasant alliance, with the working class in the leading position. In the future, it must actively participate in the world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union. Therefore, in my personal opinion, Mr. Sun's three major policies must be further developed at this point. As a loyal old believer in the Three Principles of the People, I am willing, based on Mr. Sun's consistent revolutionary spirit, to put forward three simple and clear propositions: alliance with the Soviet Union, cooperation with the Communist Party, and service to workers and peasants. The reason why I advocate 'cooperation with the Communist Party' is because the Chinese Communist Party is undoubtedly the leader of the people's democratic government, and the revolutionary elements of the Kuomintang should be in an assisting position. Furthermore, since the future state power is based on the worker-peasant alliance, of course, everything must serve the workers and peasants."

General Cheng believes that the People's Liberation Army is the best guarantee for achieving revolutionary victory and consolidating revolutionary power. He said: "In the history of world revolution, it is rare to see such a strong revolutionary military force with such excellent military discipline. If I hadn't seen and heard it myself, it would be unbelievable. With such a strong and excellent People's Liberation Army, it is naturally more than enough to eliminate the reactionary remnant forces, and it is also completely reliable to use it to protect the revolutionary regime."

General Chen Mingren Said
Only by Firmly Accepting the Leadership of the CCP Can We Serve the People and Serve the Country

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 20th—General Chen Mingren, who came to Beiping to attend the CPPCC meeting, met with reporters and said: "I am very happy that I led my troops to revolt in Hunan this time and embarked on the road to brightness from now on." He said: "My uprising was based on the fact that since the Kuomintang came to power, it has fundamentally violated Mr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary Three Principles of the People. All measures not only failed to safeguard the interests of the people, but also deepened the suffering of the people because of corruption, feudalism, selfishness, and even collusion with American imperialism, which aroused the resentment of the people. Such a reactionary regime that is an enemy of the people can only collapse in the face of the ever-developing revolutionary forces, and there is absolutely no chance of survival. We soldiers have the sacred duty of defending the country and saving the people. All armed forces should unite with the people and fight for the revolution. Especially since I myself am a student of the first class of Huangpu, I originally went there to participate in the revolution. After entering Huangpu, Chiang Kai-shek often told us that he was revolutionary and wanted to implement the Three Principles of the People, and that if he was no longer revolutionary or violated the Three Principles of the People, anyone could oppose him and overthrow him. Today, he has betrayed the revolution and disregarded the interests of the people. Can't we wake up and continue to follow their reaction? If I continue to follow them, it is knowingly making a mistake and destroying myself, completely separating myself from the broad masses of the people and violating my original intention to participate in the revolution. Moreover, the New Democracy advocated by Chairman Mao, in the current stage of implementation, is consistent with the essence of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary Three Principles of the People. All truly revolutionary soldiers should sincerely support such a correct proposition. Therefore, I had the motivation to revolt as early as February this year. In the past, due to the news blockade and propaganda deception, we did not have a deep understanding and understanding of the CCP's policies and style, and even often heard people fabricating some terrifying news, saying how the CCP deprives freedom, how they arbitrarily slaughter, how cruel they struggle, how vicious they liquidate, how they break up families, etc. But in order to save the people, I was not shaken by what was said to be true or false. I thought: Even if I am liquidated and struggled in the future, as long as the people can be liberated from now on, then I will be willing to sacrifice. In short, everything is based on the interests of the people, and personal safety and gain are not worth considering. Because I have always held this determination, I resolutely revolted under the leadership of General Cheng Qian in early August. After the uprising, we completely accepted the leadership of the CCP, and saw that what the CCP did was fair, reasonable, stable and practical, which was really admirable, and they did not treat me as an outsider, but treated me like a brother and helped me, which was especially unexpected. All the rumors and deceptions of the Kuomintang reactionaries in the past were swept away. I think the most prominent feature of the People's Liberation Army is the unity of officers and soldiers and the unity of the army and the people, so its strength is unparalleled. I am able to embark on this revolutionary road, which is very bright and correct. In the future, there is no other way to go except to follow this bright road under the leadership of the CCP and Chairman Mao Zedong and Commander-in-Chief Zhu. This should not only be the case for me personally, but all truly revolutionary soldiers must have this awareness and confidence. There are still many places in Hunan under the reactionary forces, eagerly awaiting liberation, hoping for the People's Liberation Army as much as people hope for rain in a drought, and even complaining that the People's Liberation Army is slow to advance. We used to read old books and read some words such as 'Conquering the Western barbarians from the east is resented, and conquering the Northern barbarians from the south is resented. What are we waiting for? Later they will recover,' and we never believed that there would be such a fact. Today, we have experienced it personally, and we know that these words are written for today's People's Liberation Army. He said that the troops who revolted this time must be thoroughly transformed into the People's Liberation Army. First of all, we must adopt the political work of the People's Liberation Army to transform the thinking of the troops, and at the same time, we must adopt the economic system of the People's Liberation Army to transform the life of the troops. He hoped that the People's Liberation Army would send political workers to the uprising troops as soon as possible. He said: "Only by firmly accepting the leadership of the CCP and learning from the People's Liberation Army can we serve the people and serve the country. I have made up my mind to start over, to reform thoroughly, and to learn the whole set, otherwise we cannot truly progress."

　　程潜陈明仁两将军畅谈起义以来观感
    【新华社北平二十日电】程潜将军抵平后，与各方往还，极为欢洽，顷特向记者发表起义以来的观感说：“长沙解放后，本人在长沙和这次经武汉来到北平所目击的一切——解放军的军纪、中共干部的风度和作风，社会的秩序，都使我非常钦佩。在极度落后的社会，又经过十二年的战争，残破之余，能培养出这么一个崭新的气象，能够这样稳健，这么有条不紊，这么尽其可能保存元气地来进行一个彻头彻尾的革命，确是史无前例的。这正表现了人民力量何等伟大，同时也是由于中共领导的正确。”
    程将军认为国民党反动派现在已只剩了一点残破力量，很快就将被中国革命人民的洪流彻底荡涤净尽。他对蒋李阎白等匪徒企图依靠美援和幻想爆发第三次世界大战来挽救他们的命运，认为是完全不可能的。程将军说：“美帝国主义过去送给国民党反动派的军火、金钱和物资，真是一个惊人的数目，但是三四年间，除开浪费以及豪门中饱而外，通通转送了解放军。反动派越打越弱小，现在只剩了一点残破力量，不堪一击了，就是美国再支援他，也没有用处。”关于第三次世界大战问题，程将军说：“全世界人民都是爱和平的，只有一些战争贩子和国民党的反动派，为了自己个人的利益，才不顾战争的残酷，使用各种方法鼓动战争，但是爱好和平的力量经过第二次大战更为强大了，不单是支援和平的国家互相团结，极力反对战争，就是美英两国人民的反战情绪，也日益高涨。最近的和平运动，弥漫全球，便是例证。而且，中国的解放，纵然未能消灭世界战争，也已冲淡世界战争的气氛。反动派的幻想，终归必被世界各国爱好和平的人民力量所击破。”
    程潜将军主张
    发展孙中山的三大政策联苏、协共、服务工农
    程将军以一个三民主义信徒的资格提出了他今后的主张。他说：“在孙中山先生逝世后，国民党受了以四大家族为首的反动官僚集团把持操纵，渐次走上极端反革命的道路。新中国是以工农联盟为基础的，而以工人阶级居于领导地位，今后并须积极参加以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营。所以依照我个人的意见，孙先生的三大政策，至此实有进一步发展的必要。我以一个三民主义忠实老信徒的资格，愿意本着孙先生的一贯革命精神，提出三项简截明了的主张：联苏、协共、服务工农。我之所以主张‘协共’，因为中国共产党无疑应是人民民主政府的领导者，国民党革命分子应该居于协助的地位；再者，今后国家政权，既以工农联盟为基础，当然一切须为工农服务。”
    程将军认为解放军是取得革命胜利和巩固革命政权的最好的保障。他说：“在世界革命史上，革命军事力量象这么雄厚，军纪象这么优良，还是罕见的。要不是亲见亲闻，不会令人相信。以这样雄厚而优良的解放军，肃清反动残余力量，自然绰有余裕，用来保障革命政权，也是完全可靠的。”
    陈明仁将军说
    只有坚决接受中共领导才能服务人民效力国家
    【新华社北平二十日电】陈明仁将军来平参加政协会议，接见记者说：“我这次在湖南率部起义，从此走向光明大道，是非常愉快的。”他说：“我之起义乃是鉴于国民党执政以来，根本违背了孙中山先生的革命的三民主义，一切措施，不但不能维护人民的利益，反而因为贪污腐败封建自私乃至勾结美帝国主义，更加深了人民的痛苦，引起了人民的怨恨，这种与人民为敌的反动政权，在革命力量日益发展的今天，只有走向崩溃的一途，决无可以幸存之理。我们军人是以卫国救民为天职的，所有武力，应该与人民结合起来，为革命而奋斗。尤其我本人是黄埔一期学生，当初原是为了参加革命而去的。进到黄埔以后，蒋介石还经常对我们说他是革命的，要实行三民主义的，如果他不革命了或违反三民主义，任何人都可以反对他、打倒他。今天他已背叛革命，不顾人民利益，难道我们还不觉悟，还要继续跟着他们反动吗？如果我继续跟他们走，那是明知错误，自取毁灭，完全脱离了广大的人民，违背了我原来参加革命的初衷。况且毛主席所倡导的新民主主义，在实行的现阶段说，其要旨是与中山先生的革命的三民主义相符合的，凡是真正革命的军人，对于这种正确的主张应该竭诚拥护。因此，我在今年二月就有了起义之动机。在过去由于新闻的封锁与宣传的蒙蔽，我们对于中共的政策和作风没有深切的了解和认识，甚至常常听到有人捏造一些恐怖的消息，说中共如何剥夺自由，如何任意屠杀，如何残酷斗争，如何毒辣清算，如何拆散家庭等。但是我当初为了要救人民，不管所传是真是假，都不为所动摇。我想：即使将来要对我清算斗争，而只要人民能够从此解放，那么我便牺牲亦是甘心情愿的。总之，一切以人民利益为前提，个人安危得失，不足计较。由于我始终抱了这个决心，所以到了八月初间，便毅然在程潜将军领导之下起义。起义之后，我们完全接受了中共的领导，眼见中共所作所为都是公平合理，稳健切实，实在令人钦佩，而不把我当作外人，象亲兄弟一样对待我，帮助我，尤其出乎意料之外。以前国民党反动派的种种造谣欺骗，一扫而空。我认为解放军最显著的特点是官兵一致和军民一致，所以力量强大无比。我能够走上这条革命的道路，是很光明而正确的。今后除了在中共和毛主席朱总司令领导之下走此光明道路以外，别无第二条路可走。这不但我个人应该如此，凡是一切真正革命的军人都要有这种觉悟和信心。湖南现在仍有不少地方处于反动势力之下，急切等待解放，盼望解放军有如大旱之望云霓，并且还有埋怨解放军迟迟不进的。我们从前读旧书，读到‘东面而征西夷怨，南面而征北狄怨，奚我后，后来其苏’的一些话，总不相信会有这种事实，今日身历其境，才知这些话正是为今日的解放军而写照的。他说这次起义的部队必须彻底改造为人民解放军。首先要采用解放军的政治工作改造部队的思想，同时要采用解放军的经济制度改造部队生活。他希望解放军迅速派政工人员到起义部队中去。他说：“只有坚决接受中共领导，向解放军学习，才能服务人民，效力国家，我已抱定决心，重新来过，改造要改彻底，学习要学全套，否则就不能真正进步。”
