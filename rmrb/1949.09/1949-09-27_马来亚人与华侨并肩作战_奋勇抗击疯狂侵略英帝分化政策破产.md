TASS, Delhi, September 23rd: The National Herald recently published an article entitled "Terror Mania in Malaya," which stated: The British colonialists have launched a war of aggression against the people of Malaya for more than a year, and the people of Malaya are fighting to free Malaya from imperialist oppression. The British forces in Malaya can be judged from the following example: the air force alone has 5,000 people. In addition to the British, there are 50,000 native police officers involved in suppressing the guerrillas. The heroism of the Malayan guerrillas in the struggle for independence has aroused the admiration of all honest people in the world.

　　In Malaya, terror is increasing. The British military commander in Malaya recently announced that any village where a guerrilla fighter is found will be burned down. According to the emergency decree, anyone carrying weapons without the permission of the authorities can be sentenced to death. In the two months since the promulgation of this decree, seventy-two Malayans have been hanged. The total number of men and women executed for violating the emergency law in one way or another exceeds six hundred. Thousands of Malayans are being held in prisons without trial. In the first week of August, 305 people were arrested. During August, the British military commander in Malaya imposed a curfew in eighteen Malayan towns, prohibiting residents from going out on the streets after dusk, and anyone who violated this order would be shot on the spot.

　　For many years, the British have consistently incited Malayans to oppose Chinese, but now Chinese and Malayans are fighting side by side against their common enemy—British imperialism. The traditional British policy of "divide and rule" has gone bankrupt. Britain is stepping up its terror measures, and more than 2,000 Chinese democratic elements have been arrested. All progressive overseas Chinese public groups and political organizations in Malaya have been banned.

　　In August, the British military headquarters launched another large-scale suppression campaign in the guerrilla areas. Subsequently, fierce battles took place in Perak, Pahang, Selangor, and other areas. North Perak and Gifford areas were severely bombed, causing many casualties among peaceful residents. Many more severe tests await the people of Malaya, but the patriots' response to terror is a more tenacious resistance that has now become nationwide.

　　马来亚人与华侨并肩作战
  　奋勇抗击疯狂侵略英帝分化政策破产
    【新华社北平二十五日电】塔斯社德里二十三日讯：民族报顷登载题为“马来亚的恐怖狂”一文略称：英国殖民者对马来亚人民发动侵略战争以来已有一年多了，马来亚人民正为着使马来亚摆脱帝国主义的压迫而斗争。英国在马来亚的兵力可以从下面一个事例来判断：仅空军就有五千人。除英国人外，还有五万土著警察参与讨伐游击队。马来亚游击队在争取独立斗争中的英雄主义已引起全世界一切诚实人民的钦佩。
    在马来亚，恐怖正日益增加。马来亚英军司令最近宣布：凡发现有一个游击队员的村庄，整个村庄都要烧掉。依照紧急法令，任何未得当局许可而携带武器的人即可处以死刑。自颁布这一法令以来的两个月内，七十二名马来亚人被绞杀了。因这样或那样违反紧急法而被处决的男女总达六百人以上。成千的马来亚人未经审讯即被关在监狱里。在八月份的第一周，有三百零五人被捕。八月内，马来亚英军司令在十八个马来亚市镇实施戒严，一到黄昏就禁止居民上街，凡违犯这一命令者就地枪决。
    许多年来，英国一贯唆使马来亚人反对中国人，但是现在中国人与马来亚人肩并肩地对他们的共同敌人——英国帝国主义者作战。英国传统的“分而治之”的政策已经破产。英国正加紧恐怖措施，中国民主分子二千余人被逮捕了。马来亚的一切进步华侨的公共团体与政治组织都已被取缔。
    八月份，英军司令部再度在游击地区发动大规模讨伐战。随后即在霹雳、彭亨、雪兰峨及其他地区发生激烈战争。北霹雳和季佛地区曾遭严重轰炸，和平居民有许多伤亡。许多更严酷的考验正等待着马来亚人民，但是爱国者对恐怖的回答是现在业已成为全国性的更顽强的抵抗。
