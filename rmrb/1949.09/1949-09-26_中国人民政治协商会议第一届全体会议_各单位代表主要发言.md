The First Plenary Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference
Speeches by Representatives of Various Units

Guo Moruo, Chief Representative of Non-Party Democrats

Chairman, fellow representatives:

The first plenary session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference has convened. This is the founding assembly of the People's Republic of China. The conference will adopt three great charters for the founding of the nation, representing the will of the entire Chinese people to proclaim the establishment of the People's Republic of China.

We non-party democrats are honored to participate in this grand opening ceremony. We sincerely congratulate the success of the conference.

The three great charters for the founding of the nation:

"The Constitution of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference,"

"The Constitution of the Central People's Government,"

"The Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference,"

are all drafted with a spirit of seeking truth from facts and collective wisdom, after numerous deliberations and revisions. We believe they truly reflect the actual needs of the Chinese revolution and represent the collective will of the people. We will wholeheartedly accept and unconditionally support them.

We are non-party democrats, without any party affiliations to represent. Therefore, it seems we are all individuals. But we want to firmly declare at the conference: We are not the "democratic individualists" that American imperialism attempts to seduce.

"Democratic individualism" is the essence of old democracy. If it develops to this day without self-awareness, it will turn into "Americanism." With selfish individualism as the basis, wearing a "democratic" hat. The more thorough the individualism, the more hypocritical the "democracy" hat becomes. American imperialism is a good example today. The financial, political, educational, cultural, and economic powers in the United States are all controlled by a few individuals in the eight major financial cliques, making American-style "democracy" actually oligarchic rule.

Among the Chinese people, will there still be such foolish individualists who are willing to be the fifth column of American imperialism? Such people cannot coexist with us. We are followers of Mao Zedong. We are democratic collectivists. We have no illusions about American imperialism and no fear of it. American imperialism's paper tiger has been exposed. In the future, we will continue to expose it, making it wounded all over and unrecognizable.

We are non-party democrats. Because we have no fixed party affiliations, it seems we are all very free. But we want to declare at the conference: We are also not the so-called "liberalists" who think they stand in the middle.

Today's so-called "liberalism" is actually another name for "democratic individualism." Thinking they are in the middle, in reality, they are not in the middle at all. American imperialism welcomes such people, how can they be "in the middle"?

But we are indeed quite free, and we are free to the extent that we want to freely follow Chairman Mao to lean to one side.

Domestically, we want to freely lean to the side of the Communist Party of China, supporting all the calls of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, supporting the People's Liberation Army, supporting the people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants. We support, we support, we wholeheartedly support.

Internationally, we want to freely lean to the side of the democratic and peaceful camp led by the Soviet Union. We want to unite with the Soviet Union, learn from the Soviet Union, and accept all the precious experiences of the Soviet people to engage in construction. We want to align with the Soviet Union! Learn, learn, we wholeheartedly learn.

The Chinese people have their own new motherland from today onwards. We will cherish our motherland with all our lives, strive to implement the resolutions of the conference, and abide by the people's charters. We will quickly build our people's motherland into a strong bastion of peace.

Our motherland is sacred and inviolable, not allowing any foreign aggression or internal rebellion. We must always be vigilant, breaking the conspiracies of internal and external enemies, and eliminating all possible harm from imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism.

The task of building the nation is glorious but also arduous. We are fully aware that there are countless difficulties ahead. But we firmly believe that our hardworking and brave Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, can overcome any great difficulty.

The twenty-eight-year history of the Communist Party of China's arduous struggle has educated us, and the thirty-two-year history of our ally, the Soviet Union, has also educated us, making us firmly believe that under the leadership of the Communist Party, the working masses, whose productive forces have been thoroughly liberated, can create countless miracles like myths.

The era of collective heroism has arrived. The newborn motherland, for the rapid success of the national construction, is calling for her heroic sons and daughters.

Long live the People's Republic of China!

Long live the victory of the people's democratic dictatorship!

Long live the great leader of the people, Mao Zedong!

Liu Xiao, Chief Representative of Shanghai People's Organizations

Chairman and fellow representatives:

I represent the various people's organizations in Shanghai and speak with a heart full of excitement.

First, we fully agree with and enthusiastically support the "Common Program," "Constitution of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference," and "Constitution of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China" submitted by the preparatory committee to the conference! Because this represents the concentrated interests of the entire nation and is also the goal that the people of Shanghai have been striving for over the past few decades!

The people of Shanghai, especially the working class and students, have been brave and unyielding in their struggle against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism over the past few decades. We all remember: During the May 30th Movement, tens of thousands of workers, students, and patriotic industrialists and merchants in Shanghai, with the revolutionary unity of a strong strike, boycott, and shutdown, fought against the oppression of imperialism and its running dogs, the Beiyang warlords, pushing China's revolution to its first high tide. During the Northern Expedition, Shanghai workers again staged an armed uprising to drive out the Beiyang warlords, making Shanghai people's struggle against feudal warlords and imperialism achieve great victories. The April 12th Incident, Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang he led betrayed the revolution, surrendered to imperialism, and usurped the people's victory fruits, making Shanghai people fall into fascist rule and imperialist oppression, suffering cruel white terror, and sacrificing tens of thousands of outstanding leaders of the people. But Shanghai people, especially the working class, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, wiped the blood off their bodies, buried their comrades' bodies, and stood up firmly again, fearing no sacrifice, continuing to fight against the Kuomintang's traitorous government and imperialist aggression. After the September 18th Incident, they implemented revolutionary unity with various democratic parties, people from all walks of life, and patriotic armies. Relying on this revolutionary unity, they carried out the heroic resistance against the Japanese invaders' armed aggression and the great movement of anti-Japanese and national salvation until the realization of full-scale war.

During the War of Resistance against Japan, Shanghai had already become a colony of the Japanese invaders. In Shanghai, Kuomintang members surrendered to the Japanese invaders in batches, helping the Japanese invaders to jointly suppress Shanghai people's anti-Japanese struggle. Although Shanghai people were in such extremely difficult conditions, they still bravely used their revolutionary experience, very flexibly and cleverly, to fight against the Japanese invaders and their running dogs, making the Japanese invaders suffer great difficulties in their aggressive war.

The national war of resistance was victorious, but the Kuomintang, with the support of the American imperialists, plotted to launch a civil war. The people of Shanghai used all their strength to strive with the people of the whole country to realize the Political Consultative Conference and oppose the plot of civil war. For this purpose, they held a demonstration of ten thousand people on June 23, 1946, and sent their own representatives to Nanjing to protest. But the Kuomintang finally ignored the people's will, treacherously and crazily launched a civil war. The people of Shanghai were not intimidated but, on the contrary, had a deeper understanding that to turn China into a democratic and independent country, it was necessary to thoroughly smash the imperialist, especially the American imperialist, power in China and its running dog, the Kuomintang's reactionary rule. This hope could only be realized when the people's liberation war led by the Communist Party of China was completely victorious. Of course, the people of Shanghai believed firmly over the past few years that this liberation war would definitely be quickly victorious because it had the direct leadership of Chairman Mao. Therefore, over the past few years, the people of Shanghai confidently fought against the American Chiang Kai-shek continuously, coordinating the national liberation war. The people of Shanghai, especially the workers and students, to expose the conspiracy of the American imperialists supporting Chiang Kai-shek's civil war, eliminate the people's illusions about the American imperialists, and make the people understand the essence of Chiang Kai-shek's civil war, had fearlessly carried out a series of struggles against the American imperialists, from opposing various atrocities of the American army to driving the American army out of China, to the great movement against the American imperialists' support of Japan, dealing a heavy blow to the American imperialists' support for Chiang Kai-shek's civil war. The people of Shanghai, especially the workers and students, to expose the harm of the reactionaries' civil war to the interests of the vast Chinese people, to expose the political deception of the reactionaries to cover up their civil war, to make the people in the Chiang Kai-shek area further politically enlightened to oppose the Kuomintang and support our self-defense war, had launched a fierce struggle against the civil war, hunger, and persecution. To make the liberation war quickly victorious, the people of Shanghai, especially the workers and students, had fearlessly carried out decisive struggle actions to obstruct all the reactionary political, military, and economic measures of the American Chiang Kai-shek, expand the victory propaganda of the liberation army to shake the enemy's confidence, disintegrate the enemy camp, and use various methods to weaken their combat effectiveness, developing to the point of using tens of thousands of organized people's power to protect factories and schools, obstruct the enemy's destruction of Shanghai, protect the people's national property, and carry out necessary military struggles to coordinate the liberation of Shanghai by the liberation army. Although in these struggles, the people of Shanghai had suffered unprecedented cruel and barbaric oppression, many people were imprisoned, and many people were massacred, Shanghai people remained unyielding, fighting bravely forward with the enemy in a life-and-death struggle. Fellow representatives! Why did the people of Shanghai do this? It was for the sake of achieving such a people's Political Consultative Conference and the common program we are about to adopt, and the new democratic people's republic! Today, this goal, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the complete victory of the liberation war, has been realized! The working class of Shanghai, the people of Shanghai, sincerely thank Chairman Mao! Thank General Zhu and the liberation army they lead! At the same time, I represent the people of Shanghai to pay the highest respect to Chairman Mao, General Zhu, and the liberation army! I also guarantee to Chairman Mao, General Zhu, and the conference that the people of Shanghai will defend this victory with the greatest determination and be prepared to make any sacrifice!

Now the people of Shanghai have won, Shanghai has become the people's Shanghai, but imperialism and the remaining reactionary forces of the Kuomintang are not willing to admit defeat. As Chairman Mao pointed out: They will still make their last struggle and will use various means to carry out sabotage and disruption. The silver speculation, the Great Evening News incident, the mine-laying rumors, and the Oulifu incident that occurred after the liberation of Shanghai are all planned provocations and disruptive conspiracies. But these have all been broken one by one by the people of Shanghai under the leadership of the Communist Party with their own strength. This makes the imperialists and the remaining reactionary forces of the Kuomintang have to take out their last trump card, imposing a blockade on Shanghai in an attempt to disrupt and overwhelm us. But the people of Shanghai, especially the working class, firmly believe, based on their years of struggle experience, that as long as the people of all walks of life in Shanghai can achieve revolutionary unity, they will definitely be able to overcome all difficulties and smash the enemy's sabotage and blockade. Not long ago, at the people's representative conference held in Shanghai, this spirit and confidence were fully demonstrated.

Fellow representatives! We firmly believe: Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, as long as we rely on the immense power of the revolutionary unity of the people of Shanghai, implement the six major tasks passed by the Shanghai people's representative conference, we dare to guarantee to the conference that we will definitely smash the enemy's blockade, thoroughly implement the resolutions of the conference. We will resolutely turn this past bastion of the enemy, Shanghai, into a strong bastion of the people. It will forever stand at the forefront of New China, holding high the banner of Mao Zedong, striving for the construction of New Shanghai and New China! Striving to implement the resolutions of the conference!

I wish the conference a great success!

He Long, Chief Representative of the First Field Army of the People's Liberation Army

Chairman and fellow representatives:

I represent the entire officers and soldiers of the First Field Army of the People's Liberation Army to express our excitement, joy, and enthusiasm in celebrating the success of this conference and to sincerely support the People's Republic of China and the Central People's Government produced by this conference.

Our delegation has carefully studied and discussed the common program and constitution of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, as well as the constitution of the Central People's Government and other documents, and unanimously believe that this is the best organizational form and action program for the great unity of the people of the whole country at the present stage. We not only fully agree but will also strive to achieve its complete realization.

Since the Kuomintang led by Chiang Kai-shek treacherously launched a counter-revolutionary and anti-people civil war, our First Field Army has been fighting on the Northwest battlefield. Relying on the support of the broad masses of the people, the brave fighting of all officers and soldiers, the arduous struggle, the coordination of various brother battlefields, especially the wise leadership and personal command of Chairman Mao and General Zhu, we have not only defeated the serious attacks of the Hu Ma bandits, recovered lost territories, and annihilated a large number of invading enemies, but also liberated vast areas and strengthened ourselves. Since the Huabei Army Group marched to the Northwest and joined the ranks of the First Field Army, our strength has become even more powerful and magnificent. We have now advanced to the borders of Xinjiang and Sichuan! We guarantee to the conference that we will quickly complete the task of liberating the entire Northwest and, in cooperation with the brother units, liberate the entire Southwest. We will definitely liberate Xinjiang and Sichuan. The remaining enemies on the Northwest and Southwest battlefields, if they do not surrender or accept the eight-point, twenty-four-item plan for peaceful resolution, dare to continue resistance, we will definitely and thoroughly annihilate them.

We guarantee to the conference that we will strengthen the army's construction according to the military system in the common program. We will strive to improve political awareness, military and cultural standards, and discipline, making our army more regularized. This means: We will be a powerful army with both high political quality and high modern military technology. Any imperialist who dares to invade our sacred territory will definitely receive a lesson: The Chinese people and their army are not to be trifled with!

The Northwest, where the First Field Army is located, is a vast land with rich mineral resources and many ethnic groups, and it is closely connected with our great neighbor, the Soviet Union. In the future construction of New China, it will also play an extremely important role. But the rich resources of the Northwest have not been developed, and the people's lives are extremely difficult. Although the Kuomintang reactionaries also shouted empty words about "developing the Northwest," in reality, they increased the poverty and suffering of the people of the Northwest. The task of truly developing the Northwest can only be completed by the people's own government. We guarantee to the conference that all officers and soldiers of the First Field Army, in addition to being determined to quickly complete the glorious task of liberating the entire Northwest, will also be determined to follow the policies and measures of the Central People's Government, unite the people of all ethnic groups in the Northwest, strive to develop the Northwest, and participate in the construction of New China, so that our great motherland can quickly achieve independence, democracy, peace, unity, and prosperity. One of the fine traditions of the People's Liberation Army is that we not only know how to fight but also how to produce. Therefore, we firmly believe that we can not only defeat the enemy on the military front but also win victory on the production and construction front.

Long live the success of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference!

Long live the People's Republic of China!

Long live the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao!

Long live the Commander-in-Chief of the People's Liberation Army, General Zhu!

Zhu Lian, Representative of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions

Chairman and fellow representatives:

I speak today on behalf of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the Chinese working class. In the few days of the conference, the speeches of all representatives have unanimously expressed enthusiastic support for this conference, which proves that the people of the whole country have already firmly united under the banner of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. We, the Chinese working class, are even more pleased and happy about this unprecedented people's Political Consultative Conference in Chinese history. We unconditionally agree with and support the three major historical documents proposed by the preparatory committee: the Constitution of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the Constitution of the Central People's Government, and the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference! The Chinese working class is the most oppressed class, suffering from the triple oppression of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. Under the reactionary rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, the Chinese working class has experienced countless massacres, such as the "February 7th," "May 30th," and "April 12th" incidents. Today, under the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, with the help of the People's Liberation Army, with the great unity of the people of the whole country and the support of international friends, we have turned over a new leaf, making the Chinese working class, who were once pressed to the bottom of the eighteen layers of hell, stand at the top, turning us from slaves into masters of the state and society. In the three major historical documents to be discussed and adopted at this conference, the Chinese working class has received unprecedented respect and has been placed in a leading position in the state. We feel extremely honored and proud, but also very frightened. The higher our position in the state and society, the greater our responsibility. We will follow the frequent instructions of Chairman Mao to be cautious, modest, and not arrogant or impatient. We will display the self-sacrificing spirit inherent in the working class, taking the attitude of "suffering first and enjoying later" in our work, and in the construction of New China, especially in the economic construction of restoring and developing production, we will strive with the people of the whole country to fully implement the entire common program, especially the economic policies in the program, to turn backward agricultural China into an advanced industrial China, making the Chinese people stand up not only politically but also economically. This task is arduous and cannot be completed by any single class alone. But we, the Chinese working class, firmly believe that as long as we can firmly unite with the broad masses of the Chinese people, plus the support of international friends, especially the Soviet Union, and resolutely follow the path indicated by Chairman Mao, victory will definitely be ours. This is the confidence and determination of the Chinese working class towards this conference. We shout:

Long live the great unity of the Chinese people!

Long live the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference!

Long live the People's Republic of China!

Long live the great leader of the people, Chairman Mao!

Chen Mingren, Special Invited Representative

Chairman and fellow representatives:

The task of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is to end the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism in China and to establish a people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class, based on the alliance of workers and peasants, uniting various democratic classes and ethnic groups, and building an independent, democratic, peaceful, unified, and prosperous new China. This is a historic event. I am honored to be specially invited to attend and feel extremely honored. Due to the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, the brave struggle of the liberation army, the support of the broad masses of the people, and the cooperation of various democratic forces, we have achieved today's brilliant achievements. I sincerely thank the great leader, Chairman Mao, and express my highest respect!

The three drafts proposed at this conference have been repeatedly discussed by the preparatory committee and can indeed meet the needs of Chinese society and the people, without a single high-sounding but impractical phrase. They are not only the great charter protecting the interests of the Chinese people but will also become an extremely important political document in human history because they have accomplished the task of reforming society and changing history in China, indicating that the 475 million Chinese people have a great turnaround, moving towards independence, freedom, democracy, peace, unity, and prosperity. I express my heartfelt agreement and support, especially the military system stipulated in the common program, which is a guideline for the people's liberation war to the end. I, as a military man, will sincerely support it and strive for its complete realization.

Although the new China has been born, there are still some regions eagerly awaiting liberation, and the stubborn reactionaries have never awakened, so we must continue the war to the end to thoroughly eliminate them. They will not give up their last struggle. Therefore, I feel that our liberation war still needs to continue to develop and strive. Among the remaining reactionaries, some are the ringleaders and deserve to be punished; some have been poisoned by reactionary propaganda or coerced by force and have not had the opportunity to extricate themselves. For the latter category of people, in order to shorten the war and preserve strength, we should follow Chairman Mao's magnanimous intention to awaken them, save them, and guide them to approach the people and walk towards the bright path.

I am a military man, a student of the first class of the Whampoa Military Academy, originally with the mission of defending the country and saving the people. For more than twenty years, I participated in the Northern Expedition, the War of Resistance against Japan, and fought many hard battles. Unfortunately, after the victory of the War of Resistance against Japan, Chiang Kai-shek tore up the Political Consultative Conference and launched a civil war. He deceived us and drove me to the Northeast to fight against the liberation army for many years. I still fought hard for him. At that time, I witnessed the cruelty of the war and the suffering of the people, and my doubts about Chiang Kai-shek's insistence on civil war turned into disgust. Therefore, I had more contact with various sides and gradually awakened. So, in February this year, when I returned to Changsha, I decided to support the peace proposal under the leadership of General Peng and break away from the reactionary government. At that time, I was only for the people's suffering, deep in water and fire, really unable to bear the war anymore, but I was not very clear about the true face of the Communist Party. I thought that as long as the people truly gained liberation, I would be willing to suffer severe punishment from the Communist Party. Later, because the bandits of Bai Chongxi retreated into Hunan, they took us hostage, and we could not act. It was not until early August that the liberation army drove away the White Army, and we were able to rebel. At that time, Chiang Kai-shek only knew that General Peng advocated peace and did not understand my attitude. Two days before the rebellion, he still sent someone to send a telegram to me, asking me to "uphold justice and eliminate relatives." Because General Peng was my old school principal before I entered Whampoa, the meaning was to ask me to kill General Peng. He also wanted me to lead my troops of ten thousand to defend Changsha to the death, not hesitating to sacrifice the entire army; if I did not decide to defend Changsha, I should retreat to western Hunan and execute all the peace advocates. I remember that when I was in Whampoa, Chiang Kai-shek often told us: "I am revolutionary, practicing the Three Principles of the People, when do I stop being revolutionary, you should overthrow me." I now find that Chiang Kai-shek is not only not revolutionary but is counter-revolutionary, simply an enemy of the people. I must overthrow him. Not only do I want to overthrow him, but all the Whampoa students and the people of the whole country should rise up to overthrow him. He was our school principal, and now I give him a "uphold justice and eliminate relatives." I think Chiang Kai-shek should not blame me but blame himself.

At that time, Bai Chongxi also sent a special plane to deliver an order, asking me to send troops to surround General Peng's residence on Shuiluzhou, to carry out military advice, and to take decisive measures if necessary. I rebelled, and to Bai Chongxi, was it not military advice? Unfortunately, he was stubborn and unyielding, so what use was military advice to him?

I mentioned above that before the rebellion, I was only for the people, willing to sacrifice myself. At that time, I was not very clear about the true face of the Communist Party. It was not until the liberation army entered Changsha that I truly understood the greatness of the Communist Party of China and the liberation army, who treated the rebel army with great care and help, like brothers. All their measures were extremely fair, and up to now, I have not found a single unreasonable thing done by the Communist Party. I struggled in the darkness of the Chiang regime for many years, and now I am like waking from a dream, finally walking towards the true side of the revolution. After struggling in the darkness for many years, I finally gained light, and I can stride forward. My heart is so happy and excited. Especially coming to Beijing, witnessing various parties, organizations, and people from all walks of life gathering together, so harmonious, so inspiring, so diligent and frugal, it is something I have never seen before. This is the first time in Chinese history that the people have united. This is an unstoppable tide that can be used to eliminate the remaining reactionary forces, resist foreign aggression, and build a new China, all with ease. As Chairman Mao said: "Our nation will no longer be a nation that is bullied by others, we have stood up."

In the past, I blindly followed Chiang Kai-shek, and my heart was in great pain, but under his deception, I still fought many hard battles for him, which was my mistake and also a kind of guilt I should bear for the people. Now I have stood on the side of the people, everything is subject to the people, under the leadership of the wise leader Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, I believe I can better display my courage, carry out my original intention of participating in the revolution. In the future, fighting in Guangdong, Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Taiwan, I will definitely follow the example of the veterans of the liberation army and fight to the death, making the remaining reactionary forces completely collapse and the war completely victorious. At the same time, I am willing to completely accept Chairman Mao's theory of the unity of thought and practice, learn humbly, and strive to practice, reform myself, and reform the troops I command, absolutely with the spirit of fearing neither death nor hardship to complete the tasks of revolutionary soldiers.

Long live the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference!

Long live the People's Republic of China!

Long live Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu!

Bo Yibo, Chief Representative of the Northern China Liberation Area

Chairman and fellow representatives:

The Northern China delegation has discussed in detail over the past few days and fully agrees with the Constitution of the Political Consultative Conference, the Constitution of the Government, and the Common Program proposed by the preparatory committee. We believe that these three documents summarize the experience of the Chinese people's struggle over the past 109 years, perfectly present the revolutionary demands of the Chinese people in the current period, and are the great charter of the Chinese people's long-term struggle. I represent the 67 million people of Northern China to sincerely support them and strive with the greatest effort to implement the content and spirit of the Common Program in the entire work of Northern China.

Fourteen years ago, the People's Liberation Army led by Chairman Mao, which developed from the south, arrived in the north and immediately carried out the mobilization of the masses, igniting a wave of people's revolution, which turned the backward north into a progressive north and, in the eight years of the War of Resistance and the three years of the liberation war, was able to first overthrow the rule of imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries. The people of the south helped the people of the north, and this, the people of the north will never forget. Most of Northern China is an old liberation area, which has implemented land reform according to the Outline of the Land Law, achieving the goal of "land to the tiller," and the masses have stood up; it implemented the policy of developing production and guaranteeing supply during the War of Resistance; under the leadership of the Communist Party, it organized more than a million people's liberation army; it implemented the national democratic united front including workers, peasants, soldiers, students, merchants, and various ethnic minorities from the beginning of the War of Resistance. With these conditions, we were able to successfully carry out and support the eight years of the War of Resistance and the three years of the liberation war. Although the Northern China liberation area suffered severe destruction from the enemy during the war and the struggle between the enemy and us was extremely cruel, agricultural production dropped to 60% of the pre-war level, and the burden on farmers increased to 20-30% of their total income, the people of Northern China, with their own twelve years of struggle experience, proved, as Chairman Mao pointed out in the opening speech, that with confidence and determination, we can overcome any difficulty, continue to support the front line, eliminate the remaining reactionary forces, and liberate the whole of China, and will continue to achieve victory in economic and cultural construction.

The 67 million people of Northern China will support the resolutions of the first plenary session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference with practical actions.

Under the leadership of the Central People's Government, we are determined: Within two years, to restore agricultural production to the pre-war level and strive to increase grain and economic crops. Strive to restore and reorganize the industrial production of Northern China in a planned and step-by-step manner within five to ten years, develop heavy industry, and completely change the state of relying on imperialism. Change the unreasonable urban-rural relationship in the past, achieve mutual assistance and economic exchange between urban and rural areas, with rural areas supporting cities with grain and economic crops, and cities providing agricultural tools, machinery, and industrial necessities to rural areas. On the solid foundation of economic mutual assistance, strengthen the alliance of workers and peasants. Further build and strengthen the people's democratic dictatorship in Northern China, whether in old or new liberation areas, universally establish village, district, and county people's representative assemblies or people's representative conferences of all walks of life this winter and next spring, and prepare to hold provincial people's representative conferences next year. Raise the level of science and culture, strengthen technical education, and promote universal education as quickly as possible. Continue to strengthen local armed forces and mass work, eliminate bandits and special agents, maintain revolutionary order, and ensure that all industries and walks of life can concentrate on construction work.

The military and people of the Northern China liberation area have, in twelve years of revolutionary war, already displayed their high initiative and unyielding spirit of heroic sacrifice, and have made a certain contribution to the people's revolutionary cause. But we cannot be complacent. We have made some mistakes in our work and still have many shortcomings in our current work. In the future, we will forever follow Chairman Mao's instructions to "be modest and prudent, guard against arrogance and impetuosity," and diligently carry out the various policies stipulated by this people's Political Consultative Conference, better complete the tasks given to us by the Common Program.

Liu Geping, Chief Representative of Ethnic Minorities

Chairman, fellow representatives, and distinguished guests:

The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is held on the basis of the great victory of the Chinese people's liberation war and the unprecedented unity of the people of the whole country. It marks that our country's history has completely entered the period of people's democracy and national equality. We ethnic minority representatives participating in this conference truly feel honored and happy to discuss the major policies of building a new China with other representatives on an equal basis!

The three documents of this Political Consultative Conference, the Common Program, the Constitution of the Government, and the Constitution of the Political Consultative Conference, reflect the results of the long-term struggle of the Chinese people (including ethnic minorities). We believe that these three documents are the beacon of the Chinese people. We ethnic minorities will support and implement them with 100% of our hearts and souls.

The liberation of each ethnic minority is inseparable from the liberation of the entire Chinese people.

Chiang Kai-shek implemented the reactionary rule of great Han chauvinism, colluding with the feudal upper class scum of various ethnic minorities, such as Demchugdongrub (De Wang) and Bai Yuntian of the Mongolian people; Bai Chongxi, Ma Buqing, and Ma Hongkui of the Hui people; the local chiefs of the Yi and Miao peoples; and the local bullies and landlords of various ethnic minorities to carry out massacres, deception, enslavement, division, and exploitation, making the people of various ethnic minorities isolated from each other and creating hatred. Under these circumstances, the people of each ethnic minority, of course, would demand self-determination and separation from the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism.

After the independence and self-determination of Outer Mongolia, have their people not already obtained freedom and liberation?

But today, the situation we are in is completely different. In the liberated areas, the central task of ethnic minorities is regional autonomy and national unity. We see:

First, our People's Liberation Army is rapidly annihilating the remaining Kuomintang bandits, advancing towards the northwest (and will soon merge with the democratic forces of Xinjiang), southwest, southeast, and Taiwan, to completely eliminate the internal and external enemies of these ethnic minorities and their accomplices, smash the pests that hinder the unity of the people of all ethnic minorities in China, and make the people of all ethnic minorities in China able to unite in this big family of the Chinese nation.

Second, in the great victory of the eight years of the Chinese people's revolutionary war of resistance and the three years of the liberation war, the people of each ethnic minority, in the liberation areas of North China, East China, Northeast China, and Northwest China, united with the entire Chinese people, fought side by side, broke through all ethnic barriers; many organized people's armed forces, carried out land reform, developed production, and supported the front line.

Third, in the liberated areas, ethnic minorities have obtained equal status in politics, economy, and culture, implementing self-government at the village, township, and street levels to guarantee the rights of ethnic minorities. Under the unified national military system, they can join the People's Liberation Army and organize ethnic public security forces to protect the lives and property of the people of various ethnic minorities.

In Inner Mongolia, the autonomous region has been established for more than two years, which is the best example of ethnic autonomy and a concrete manifestation of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao's ethnic policy.

Therefore, we must be especially vigilant against the Kuomintang bandits and the American and British imperialists (who are plotting in Tibet) to incite and split the unity of the people of various ethnic minorities. Today, the ethnic policy clearly stipulated in the Common Program is the goal that the people of various ethnic minorities have fought for blood and tears for hundreds of years, and today it has finally been realized. We are 100% in agreement and support it. Seeing the bright and happy future of each ethnic minority and the entire Chinese people, we are indescribably happy and excited!

Finally, every person among the broad masses of each ethnic minority must cherish and treasure this great charter of the people and strive for its complete realization! "Oppose great-nation chauvinism and narrow nationalism, prohibit discrimination, oppression, and actions that split the unity of ethnic minorities." We must cooperate with the People's Liberation Army to eliminate the internal and external public enemies of ethnic minorities, smash and expel the conspiracies and invasions of imperialism, carry the revolution to the end, and only then can we plan and step by step complete our peaceful construction. The direction determined by this Common Program is a particularly arduous task for us, but we firmly believe that under the wise leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we will definitely overcome all difficulties and achieve great success!

Celebrate the founding of the People's Republic of China!

Celebrate the success of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference!

Ma Xulun, Chief Representative of the China Democratic Promotion Association

Fellow representatives:

The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, which the people of the whole country have longed for, has opened. This is achieved by the great victory of the Chinese people's liberation war and people's revolution. Not only are we, the representatives, full of joy and excitement here, but wherever the news of the conference reaches, the people there are also greatly excited. Now, I, on behalf of the China Democratic Promotion Association, express my congratulations and respect to the Chinese Communist Party and the wise leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, who led the people to achieve great victory!

We believe that the three documents that will be adopted at the conference, which open a new chapter in Chinese history—the Constitution of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and the Constitution of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China—are the products of the victory of the Chinese people's democratic united front. We enthusiastically support them.

The Chinese people have long suffered from the oppression of feudal forces, and for more than a hundred years, they have also suffered from the aggression of imperialism. The people of various classes in China, including the national bourgeoisie, have all been subjected to their oppression and have different degrees of resistance and revolutionary nature. But without the leadership of the proletariat, the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolution of China cannot succeed. The Chinese bourgeoisie has also launched revolutions, but once in power, they compromised with imperialism and feudal forces and were seized by the leadership of the big landlords and big bourgeoisie, oppressing the people, massacring the people, and exploiting the people. Now it is different. We have formed a people's democratic united front led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants! We not only achieved victory but can also consolidate this victory and begin to build a new China. This is guaranteed because the Communist Party of China is leading us.

The significance of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is global. The victory of the Chinese people has made a great contribution to the defense of world peace, giving a great encouragement to the liberation movement of the oppressed peoples in the East, and dealing a heavy blow to the rule of imperialist colonies. China is a semi-colonial, semi-feudal, and industrially backward country. After the victory of the revolution, the most important task is production and construction. Therefore, we must jointly encourage private capital and overseas Chinese to cooperate with state capital in a planned manner to develop industry. We believe: The national capitalists of New Democratic China are different from the capitalists of old democracy in England and America. The capitalists of England and America are only for personal interests, and they do not care about the national economy and people's livelihood. The interests of our national capitalists are inseparable from the interests of the nation and state, so they must be able to jointly build an industrialized New China according to the economic policies of the Common Program.

In the ideological field, we must also pay attention to the so-called "democratic individualism" thought. If we do not clarify the thought of old democracy in England and America, this thought will remain. Therefore, we must intensify the study of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought and promote this education extensively; everyone must be closely united, reform oneself, and serve the people wholeheartedly under the common goal of New Democracy, so that there is no room for the international big conspiracy like the one that occurred in Hungary in China!

Now the people's revolution has won, and the democratic united government will be proclaimed. But the current great victory, as Chairman Mao said, "is only the first step of the long march." Therefore, after the conference, we must seriously convey the significance of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the spirit and content of the Common Program, and the characteristics of the power of the People's Republic of China to the masses, and implement the resolutions of the conference, so that the people of the whole country under the power of the Central People's Government can be more united, on the one hand, to eliminate the remaining reactionary forces, eradicate the power of American-led imperialism in China, and make any conspiracy of the American imperialists and reactionaries have no room to exploit; on the other hand, with the greatest effort, engage in economic and cultural construction, and jointly build a brilliant People's Republic of China.

Long live the People's Republic of China!

Long live the Communist Party of China and the people's leader, Chairman Mao!

Long live the success of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference!

Zhang Ye, Chief Representative of Farmers' Organizations in Various Liberation Areas

Fellow representatives:

I speak on behalf of the farmers to express their feelings.

We farmers have long been oppressed and exploited by imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. The landlords and rich peasants, who are the running dogs of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, have been oppressing and exploiting us farmers for generations. They have been robbing us of our land and labor, making us live in misery and suffering. But today, under the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, with the help of the People's Liberation Army, we farmers have finally stood up. We have implemented land reform, distributed the land of the landlords and rich peasants to us farmers, and we have obtained the land we have been longing for. We are no longer slaves but masters of the land. We are full of joy and excitement.

We farmers will support the resolutions of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference with all our strength. We will implement the Common Program and the Constitution of the Central People's Government, and we will build a new China with our own hands. We will develop agriculture and industry, improve our living standards, and make our motherland prosperous and strong.

We farmers will also support the People's Liberation Army and the People's Government. We will provide them with food, clothing, and other supplies, and we will support them in their struggle against the reactionaries and imperialists. We will defend our motherland and build a new China with our own hands.

Long live the People's Republic of China!

Long live the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference!

Long live the People's Liberation Army!

Long live Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China!

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 22nd.

The reactionary rule has been declared dead, and the suffering of the peasants has ended!

We peasants have "rebelled," rebelled generation after generation, but we only ended up in tragic failure. It was only in the era of Chairman Mao that, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we succeeded in our rebellion and stood up!

In the dynasties without the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, every time we peasants rose up in rebellion, "rebelled," the outcome was always a tragic failure.

Chairman Mao led us through three revolutionary stages. We went through the Land Revolution War, the War of Resistance Against Japan, and today's People's Liberation War. We have awakened and organized ourselves. We are no longer the laughing stock of being a scattered sand, we have become a powerful iron fist.

Everyone has seen that to ensure the victory of the war, we peasants enthusiastically sent millions of our children to join the People's Liberation Army. During the critical periods of the war, sometimes all our young and strong men went to support the front lines. To ensure that the frontline soldiers could eat their fill, we were willing to endure a harsh life and donate all our surplus grain. In the rear, we organized women, children, and the elderly to prevent spies and work diligently. When the Kuomintang bandits tried to flood us with the Yellow River, we rushed to repair it. Just from Jinan to the mouth of the Yellow River, we mobilized more than 14 million man-days and over 20 million jin of grain to repair the Yellow River, overcoming the difficulties and dangers. In short, with Chairman Mao's leadership, we can overcome all difficulties and achieve great victories.

In the future, both internal and external enemies will not be willing to admit defeat and will use every means to sabotage us; at the same time, there will be many difficulties in the construction process, but we are confident that under the leadership of Chairman Mao, by mobilizing everyone's strength, we will definitely defeat all enemies and overcome any difficulties to achieve the final victory!

Long live Chairman Mao! We will forever follow you!

Long live Commander-in-Chief Zhu! We entrust our children to you to defend the fruits of victory!

Long live the People's Republic! We entrust our grain and industrial raw materials to you to build a prosperous new China!

We, the representatives of all peasants, come to this conference with such feelings. We have studied the three documents of the conference—the Organizational Law of the Political Consultative Conference, the Organizational Law of the Central People's Government, and the Common Program—and based on the experiences of each peasant representative, we unanimously agree that these three historic documents include the interests of the peasants. The interests of the peasants are completely consistent with the interests of all the people and the interests of all nationalities. Therefore, we fully agree, we resolutely support, and we are willing to struggle for their thorough implementation!

First, we will continue to support the front lines and carry out the people's revolutionary war to the end, striving for final victory!

Second, we will step by step thoroughly destroy the feudal system, implement land reform, and achieve the goal of "those who till the land own the land."

Third, we will strive to produce on our land, produce large quantities of grain and industrial raw materials, and strive for the industrialization of the country.

We fully understand that Chairman Mao is our peasants' mentor, and the working class is our elder brother. Only by relying on the advanced working class brothers, restoring and developing industrial construction, can we transform the backward production and living methods in the countryside, and only then can we finally escape poverty.

We warmly welcome the intellectuals and cultural circles to bring their talents in science, technology, and culture to help us. The minds of the peasants have been enlightened, and in the future, they will be even more enlightened. Because we need to launch a vast rural production movement to establish a reliable foundation for industrial construction, we must improve our culture and learn science.

We sincerely hope that the industrial and commercial circles will produce in large quantities the things needed by the peasants, and under the principle of mutual aid between cities and countryside and equal exchange, we can prosper together and promote the development of the entire social economy.

Finally, we peasants wish to unite closely with all democratic classes and all nationalities within the country to strive for the thorough implementation of the Common Program!

Special Invitation Representative

Deng Baoshan Speech

Chairman, distinguished representatives:

The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference has been successfully convened under the enthusiastic expectations of the people of the whole country and the enthusiastic expectations of the people of the world who love peace. The brave Chinese people have not only defeated the armed intervention of imperialism and the bloody rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries but have also begun to build their own independent, democratic, peaceful, and happy new China.

I am grateful to Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, the Communist Party of China, the People's Liberation Army, and the Chinese people for their magnanimity, which allowed me to resolutely break away from the shackles of the Kuomintang reactionaries and gain a new life; allowed me to participate in this historic Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference; allowed me to follow the distinguished representatives and learn from them.

In the past, the Kuomintang reactionaries often propagated that the new China has no democracy and no freedom; even now, they are still propagating such lies. Therefore, today, I want to expose these shameless lies on the podium of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and in front of the people of the whole country. I want to declare to the people of the whole country: those who do not want democracy and freedom are the reactionaries themselves! The new China not only has sufficient democracy and freedom but also gives opportunities for self-reform to all those who have made mistakes in the past, as long as they are willing to correct their mistakes. Today, I am a clear example of this!

I would like to advise the patriotic elements in the Northwest, Southwest, South China, and Taiwan liberation areas who are still hesitating and wavering: do not hesitate, do not waver, quickly break away from the darkness and walk towards the light, resolutely and unconditionally side with the people!

When General Fu Zuoyi and I went to Suiyuan, the Kuomintang reactionaries initially tried every means to win us over, but when they failed, they instructed their lackeys to distribute leaflets and post slogans, deliberately ignoring that the peaceful liberation of Beijing was the unanimous wish of the people of the whole country, but saying that we had betrayed Beijing and were going to betray Suiyuan, trying to sabotage the uprising of the people and soldiers of Suiyuan. However, the people and soldiers of Suiyuan clearly know who is really betraying Taiwan! Who is really betraying Tibet! They clearly know that what we oppose is precisely these traitors who sell China's territory and sovereignty to imperialism! Therefore, in the future, we will continue to oppose them until these traitors are completely eliminated from Chinese soil!

Distinguished representatives, today we have such an enlightened leader of the people—Chairman Mao, such a strong party of the people—the Communist Party of China, such an invincible army of the people—the People's Liberation Army, and so many people who are fighting for the united front—democratic parties and democratic personages, as well as 475 million awakened people. I firmly believe that an independent, democratic, peaceful, and prosperous new China will forever stand tall in the world. Let the domestic and foreign reactionaries tremble in front of the people, we shout:

The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is a great success!

Long live the People's Republic of China!

Long live Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu!

Special Invitation Representative

Sun Lanfeng Speech

Chairman, distinguished representatives:

I am very honored to participate in the People's Political Consultative Conference today, but at the same time, I feel very ashamed.

The People's Political Consultative Conference is an unprecedented great unity of the people of the whole country; it is the realization of the ideal that the Chinese people have been pursuing for many years. Now, the new China has been born, and based on the three great charters—the Organizational Law of the Political Consultative Conference, the Organizational Law of the Central People's Government, and the Common Program—the independence, democracy, peace, unity, and prosperity of the new China are more guaranteed.

I am a military man from the ranks, and just a week ago, I was still a member of the criminal reactionary clique. The reactionaries used every means of incitement, division, deception, and sabotage to prevent me from joining the ranks of the people. It was not until the 19th of this month that I, along with General Dong Jiuwu, led my troops to rebel. Chairman Mao's magnanimous policy not only does not pursue past mistakes but also allows me to participate in this sacred People's Political Consultative Conference. I truly feel limitless excitement.

I have been involved in revolutionary work for more than thirty years, believing in Mr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary Three Principles of the People. If his proposals could be thoroughly implemented, China could have become an independent and prosperous country long ago. However, the reactionary clique led by Chiang Kai-shek betrayed the revolution, betrayed Mr. Sun, and relied on American imperialism to launch a counter-revolutionary civil war. Fortunately, under the leadership of the great Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China, and the joint efforts of the people of the whole country, imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism have been thoroughly eliminated, and we have this People's Political Consultative Conference today, and we can establish a People's Republic of China with the working class as the leader, the worker-peasant alliance as the basis, and the unity of all democratic classes and nationalities.

However, the revolutionary work is arduous, and there will be many obstacles in the future. We must, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, follow the three major plans formulated by our conference, remain steadfast in our faith, strengthen our forces, and strive for the victory of New Democracy! I personally will also strive to learn from the people, learn from Chairman Mao, and learn from the distinguished representatives, and strive for the construction of an independent, democratic, peaceful, unified, and prosperous People's Republic of China! We shout:

Long live the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference!

Long live the People's Republic of China!

Long live Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu!

Chinese Nationalist Party Democratic Promotion Association Representative

Jiang Guangnai Speech

Chairman, distinguished representatives:

I am very fortunate to be able to participate in this conference. It is like a person who has been groping in the dark for many years suddenly seeing the light. The three drafts to be passed at this conference—the "Organizational Law of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference," the "Organizational Law of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China," and the "Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference"—are the symbols of this brilliant and dazzling lamp! I feel excited, happy, and sincerely express my support, and I am willing to struggle to the end for its thorough implementation!

From the time of the Xinhai Revolution to the time of the National Revolution, the provinces of South China were the base where Mr. Sun Yat-sen raised the banner of revolution to fight against the Northern Warlords. The people and revolutionary soldiers of South China also had glorious and heroic struggles against imperialism and feudalism under Mr. Sun's leadership. Now, the remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries led by the war criminal Chiang Kai-shek are actually trying to use South China and Southwest China as their counter-revolutionary base for their dying struggles, further selling the country and enslaving the people. This is not only what the people of South China hate with gnashing teeth, but it is also what the revolutionary soldiers who once had a glorious history should hate with gnashing teeth.

Therefore, at this People's Political Consultative Conference, I wish to tell the Kuomintang system soldiers in the South China liberation areas: light has already shone on China, the time does not allow you to hesitate, nor does it allow you to observe! For the sake of the glorious history we once had in the Chinese revolution, for the sake of the rapid realization of the liberation of the South China areas, you must recognize reality, align with Beijing, align with Changsha, and align with Suiyuan! Are you going to decide to bury yourselves by following the Kuomintang bandits, or are you going to resolutely stand on the side of the people?

I also wish to tell the compatriots in the South China liberation areas: you have a glorious tradition in the Chinese revolutionary struggle, this tradition is being destroyed by the American imperialist lackey Chiang Kai-shek, Li Zongren, Yan Xishan, and the reactionaries! You should also stand up, cooperate with the liberated areas of South China, cooperate with the southward-marching liberation army, smash the reactionary rule of Chiang Kai-shek, and smash the American imperialists' attempt to establish a so-called "individual democracy"!

The People's Republic of China is about to be established! The Chinese people are about to completely stand up! The struggle to finally liberate South China and Southwest China is about to come like a storm and rain, the South China soldiers and people with a glorious history should stand up quickly, welcome the southward-marching liberation army, welcome the birth of the People's Republic of China, welcome the great liberation of the people throughout the country in history!

Special Invitation Representative

Huang Shaojie Speech

Chairman, distinguished representatives:

I was invited to participate in this Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and when it opened, I listened to Chairman Mao's opening speech, and in these days, I listened to the speeches of the distinguished representatives, which made me very excited!

At this political consultative conference, as Chairman Mao said, we will formulate the Organizational Law of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, formulate the Organizational Law of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, formulate the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, elect the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, elect the Central People's Government Committee of the People's Republic of China, formulate the national flag and emblem of the People's Republic of China, decide the location of the capital of the People's Republic of China, and adopt the same calendar as most countries in the world.

I believe this is the greatest manifestation of the power and unity of the Chinese people, and such a great manifestation of power and unity is certainly not something that the remaining reactionary forces can resist, nor is it something that any imperialist can stop!

The complete success of this Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is not only enthusiastically celebrated and sincerely supported by us who are present at the conference and the compatriots in the already liberated areas, but also by the more than 100 million compatriots in the still unliberated areas such as Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, Xikang, Xinjiang, and Taiwan, who are eagerly awaiting the arrival of this great power! They will definitely support the fruits of this conference even more.

The Kuomintang and its lackeys have always used deception to enslave the compatriots in the unliberated areas, especially for this conference, they will definitely use various methods to slander and curse it in order to achieve their goal of deception again! I want to use this opportunity to expose their despicable deception plot and hope that the compatriots in the unliberated areas, the soldiers, and the colleagues in the agencies will all stand up to overthrow the remaining reactionary forces and jointly build a new democratic China!

When the people of the whole country hope for peace, the reactionaries want to use peace as a cover for their military failures, but that fake peace can only temporarily cover up the wounds of defeat and continue to fail. Now they want to use war to prolong their last breath, I dare to say that no matter what methods they use to escape to any place, trying to preserve the reactionary forces to resist the great power of the people, the result is always an illusion and a failure! Only by turning around and joining the power of the people can they truly exist and have a bright future!

The magnanimity of the Chinese people is great, and Chairman Mao's policy is magnanimous. As long as they turn around, they will be welcomed back into the warm embrace of the people, just like me who has been invited to participate in this conference. I have seen in various places those officers and soldiers who have rebelled and surrendered but have not found their place!

In the liberated areas, I have seen that industry, agriculture, and various public services have made great strides, not only restoring the pre-war standards, but in some places, the efficiency, methods, and rules have already improved significantly compared to before the war. Such amazing achievements are not due to external material assistance, but due to the correct political leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, and the people themselves have become the masters, and everyone has clearly understood their responsibilities and worked hard to achieve this result. This is truly the dawn of the new China, and this dawn will shine like the sun at noon with the complete success of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference!

In the already liberated major cities, I have seen that various measures are being carried out in a reasonable and reasonable manner. They consider the habits of society, even if they think they are not good in essence, they also consider the livelihood of those engaged in them, first changing their psychology and customs, and then changing their professions. They do not, like Chiang Kai-shek, issue a single order to solve any problem based on personal or minority preferences.

The staff led by the Communist Party, whether civilian or military, are now displaying a great spirit of serving the people in various places. All those who have come from the Kuomintang-controlled areas are deeply surprised and satisfied! They have planned, thorough, humble, sincere, and frank style, not only making those who receive their service deeply respect them, but also having many touching stories written in front of people!

They are not the personal affection of some people to some people, but the whole to the whole, displaying their great spirit of service. The high development of this spirit is a powerful guarantee for the construction of New Democracy and the new China.

Deception cannot cover up the truth, and sophistry cannot defeat the facts. If the important members of the reactionaries could come here, as long as their conscience has not been extinguished, they would definitely feel uneasy and achieve enlightenment and reflection. Compatriots who have been deceived! I dare not say false words to you, I am pursuing the truth to seek the facts, and now the facts have been proven, please do not doubt and be deceived by the reactionaries again. Everyone should unite and overthrow the reactionary deceivers! Everyone should unite under the leadership of Chairman Mao to complete the construction of a new democratic China!

The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is opening, and it will quickly achieve complete success. I am willing to exert my greatest efforts for this conference, especially to follow the representatives of all the democratic parties and democratic personages of the country, resolutely support the resolutions of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and complete the construction of an independent, free, equal, unified, and prosperous new China!

Beijing and Tianjin Directly Administered Municipal Chief Representative

Huang Jing Speech

Chairman, distinguished representatives:

The representative team of the Beijing-Tianjin area unanimously supports the wise instructions of Chairman Mao in his opening speech.

The Chinese people have been able to achieve such great unity and defeat such a powerful enemy to achieve such unprecedented victories completely because of the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, the heroic fighting of the People's Liberation Army, and the unity and joint efforts of various democratic parties and democratic classes. This great victory gives us full confidence to build a new China. We firmly believe that under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, everyone continues to unite as one, the construction of the new China will definitely succeed.

All the representatives of our representative team fully agree with the three major documents of the conference. Because they fully reflect the needs of the people. The formulation of these three documents has laid the most perfect political and organizational foundation for the great unity of the people of the whole country. It is an important guarantee for consolidating the victory of the Chinese people and building a new China. Therefore, we hope that these three major documents can be smoothly passed at the conference, and we are determined to struggle for their implementation.

We, the representatives of 4 million people in Beijing and Tianjin, declare and guarantee to the conference:

We will definitely strive in the great cause of national construction to do a good job in the economic and cultural work of Beijing and Tianjin. We will also strive to support the front lines and strive for the complete liberation of the country as soon as possible. In economic work, we will adhere to the policy of balancing public and private interests, benefiting both labor and capital, mutual aid between urban and rural areas, and exchange between domestic and foreign countries, and strive to correctly handle various complex economic relations so that production can develop rapidly. In cultural work, we will strive to develop New Democratic culture and education, universally develop the thought of serving the people, cultivate a large number of talents for national construction, and meet the needs of the construction of the new China.

In the past, our cities were occupied by the enemy, making the cities' contributions to the revolution less than the countryside, but in the future construction, we will not fall behind again, we will strive to catch up with the countryside, and we will even strive to contribute more than the countryside, only in this way can we complete the task of China's industrialization.

Since the liberation of Beijing and Tianjin, we have received a lot of support from the countryside and other areas, especially from Northeast China. We are grateful for their support. We should strive to restore and develop production and strive to provide the countryside with beautiful and cheap goods, and strive to meet the other needs of the countryside for the city. We hope that in the future, we will further develop our mutual aid relationship with the countryside and other areas.

We enthusiastically support the establishment of the capital of the People's Republic of China in Beijing. We believe this is the unanimous wish of the people of the whole country, and we feel this is the greatest honor for the people of Beijing and Tianjin.

We will not relax our vigilance, we will actively prevent and suppress the sabotage plots of the reactionaries, eliminate all hidden enemies, consolidate our capital, and defend our construction.

We are in the area directly under the Central People's Government, and we have more confidence to build these two cities well. We will unconditionally execute all the resolutions of this People's Political Consultative Conference and be prepared to accept and complete all the tasks given to us by the Central People's Government.

Shanghai Various People's Organizations Representative

Zhu Junxin Speech

Chairman, distinguished representatives:

I represent the workers of Shanghai to say a few words:

We, the working class, were the most despised slaves under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, but today, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we have become the masters. Today, we, the working class, can send representatives to participate in the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference to discuss state affairs, and we should first express our gratitude to Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and the People's Liberation Army they lead, and pay our highest respects to them.

Shanghai is a city with the most concentrated workers in the country. Due to Shanghai's past superficial prosperity, it was built on the economic foundation of relying on imperialism and bureaucratic capitalism. Now, American imperialism is helping its lackey, the Kuomintang reactionaries, to use this weakness to blockade our ports and try to obstruct our industrial construction and production development. This is the enemy's attempt to blockade us. Indeed, there are difficulties, but we are not afraid, we will only fight against them more resolutely.

We remember that during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, the Kuomintang reactionaries used secret and open arrests and killings against us workers, we sacrificed many people, but we were not intimidated, instead, we fought more actively, truly achieving that one person falls, ten thousand people stand up, with confidence and unity with people of all walks of life, finally achieving victory. Now, are we still afraid of what?

The enemy's blockade, they cannot blockade our two hands. Today, we only need to work harder to develop production, support the People's Liberation War; under the banner of Chairman Mao's victory, carry out the revolutionary war to the end, and liberate the whole of China quickly!

For the future construction work, we workers will definitely work hard and unite with the people of the whole country, strive for self-reliance, break through the enemy's blockade, build a new Shanghai and a new China for the people, and consolidate our victory.

Today, in the private enterprises of Shanghai, although there are still labor disputes, in the future, as long as both sides understand, under the leadership of the New Democratic government, with the spirit of consensus, it will definitely be resolved. We workers today naturally cannot avoid having many shortcomings, and we hope that people of all walks of life will give us more guidance.

In the future, the relationship between workers and the industrial sector will be very close, and we need to strengthen unity, overcome the current difficulties, and implement the Common Program. We workers need to work harder and learn more to become models for the people, so that we will not be unworthy of the workers of the new China.

We guarantee to the conference that we will bring the spirit and resolutions of the conference to all factories in Shanghai, so that the 1 million workers in Shanghai will understand their historical mission, mobilize their enthusiasm for labor, improve productivity, and strive for the construction of a new Shanghai and a new China.

We shout:

Long live the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference!

Long live the People's Republic of China!

Long live the Communist Party of China!

Long live the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao!

Peasant Representative

Li Xiuzhen Speech

I am very happy to participate in the conference, and the people of the whole country are happy.

In the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan and the three years of the Liberation War, peasants played a great role. We sent our sons and husbands to the army. I myself am an example. I only have one son, who joined the army and was killed by the reactionary Chiang Kai-shek. I did not shed a single tear, my son sacrificed for the people and died a glorious death, and all comrades are avenging him. To support the war, we peasants ate vegetable soup and porridge, and sent grain to the front lines. Today, holding such a conference is not easy, it is the blood and sweat of the people that has brought it about.

Under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we have overthrown the tyrants, reduced rent, and now we have divided the land and have political rights.

In the past, we women were oppressed and exploited, and had no status. The reactionary Chiang Kai-shek even raped women. Now we women have also stood up and have status. This is all thanks to the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. We will forever follow Chairman Mao and will not go wrong.

After I go back, I will mobilize peasant women to work hard, support the front lines, and thoroughly defeat Chiang Kai-shek to liberate the whole of China. American imperialism is helping him, but American imperialism is also a paper tiger, we are not afraid of him!

Religious Circle Democratic Personage Chief Representative

Wu Yaozong Speech

We, the eight representatives of religious units, including representatives of Buddhism, Islam, and Christianity, are very happy and excited to fully agree with and absolutely support the three important documents—the "Organizational Law of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference," the "Organizational Law of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China," and the "Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference."

We agree with and support these three documents because they are all formulated based on the principles of New Democracy through consultation, and New Democracy is the only path that China must follow today.

The Common Program points out that the new political power after liberation is "people's democratic dictatorship," which is based on the worker-peasant alliance and led by the working class, a united front government. This united front includes all classes except reactionaries—the working class, peasant class, petty bourgeoisie, national bourgeoisie, and other patriotic democratic elements, as well as ethnic minorities and people of various religious beliefs. This united front does not require a super-realistic program, but a realistic program that unites the will of the people of the whole country, making them move forward together towards a common goal.

This united front will make China, which was once ridiculed as "a heap of loose sand," form an unprecedented great unity. In the past, the reason why the Chinese people could not unite was not because they lacked the will to struggle, but because they lacked correct leadership, and the rulers used the evil method of "divide and rule." Now, we have seen our common enemy, which is imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism; we have also seen our common goal, which is an independent, democratic, peaceful, unified, and prosperous People's Republic of China. Because we have found a common goal and recognized a common enemy, we can unite and form a united front, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, to display our inherent, immense power.

The united front will also make China achieve true democracy. It allows every person in it to participate in the national affairs under a common goal, express their opinions, and propose their proposals. The democratic centralism adopted in the Common Program will ensure the full realization of this democratic principle, because it requires the people's government to be responsible to the people's representatives, and the people's representatives to be responsible to the people.

We, religious believers, are able to participate in the great cause of building the new China, which is an honorable and happy thing. We feel honored and happy because in the plan of building the new China, religion occupies the position it should occupy. In the Common Program, the principle of freedom of religious belief is established. We cherish this freedom, and we will not betray or abuse this freedom. We will also use all our strength to root out the corrupt traditions in religion and its past connections with feudal forces and imperialism. We will not only do the work of disinfection in religion but also promote the positive role of religion. Seeking truth and serving humanity are the common goals of all advanced religions. Applying this goal to today's China and today's world is to eliminate the remnants of feudal forces, overthrow the aggression and war-mongering plots of imperialism, and at the same time support the forces of permanent world peace and democratic construction. We are willing to follow the national democratic parties and democratic personages to strive for the realization of this common goal.

South China People's Liberation Army Representative

Wu Qiuwei Speech

Chairman, distinguished representatives:

Today, I am able to participate in this conference representing all revolutionary classes, democratic parties, people's organizations, nationalities, and overseas Chinese democratic personages of China, and discuss with all the representatives the three documents proposed by the Preparatory Committee—the Organizational Law of the Political Consultative Conference, the Organizational Law of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, and the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. I feel extremely honored and excited. Because I believe that the drafting of these three documents fully reflects the new democratic spirit and the demands of the people of the whole country, I believe that every Chinese person will be satisfied and wholeheartedly support them.

I am now standing in this great and solemn ceremony to speak, and I also feel extremely ashamed. I am a military man and a member of the Kuomintang. I once vowed to strive for the realization of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary Three Principles of the People. After the Northern Expedition, the Kuomintang was usurped by Chiang Kai-shek, and Mr. Sun's three policies were betrayed by Chiang Kai-shek. I was also deceived and fooled by the shameless revolutionaries like Chiang Kai-shek. Especially in the few years before the War of Resistance, I even became a tool for counter-revolution and anti-people, obstructing the progress of the revolution. But after the end of the War of Resistance, when Chiang Kai-shek launched the civil war, I began to realize that this civil war was against the people's demands and a criminal act of harming the people. I was already unwilling to actively serve as their tool for the civil war. But at that time, I was still hesitant and confused and did not have the resolve to leave them. Later, in the civil war, I saw the brutal measures of the reactionary government, which aroused the anger of the people of the whole country, and on the other hand, I saw that the People's Liberation Army led by the Communist Party actually implemented the policy of loving the country and loving the people, and was supported by the people everywhere. This fact enlightened me and educated me. It made me recognize the ugly face of the reactionaries and recognize that the revolutionary line led by the Communist Party was the true implementation of Mr. Sun's revolutionary proposals. I realized that only by advancing under the banner of Chairman Mao could I seek the independence and prosperity of the country, the freedom and happiness of the people, so I resolutely walked into the ranks of the people.

Today, the Kuomintang bandits are even more despicable and shameless, even colluding with the Japanese fascist military, the national enemy, to massacre the people. I believe that these despicable measures will only speed up the thorough awakening of patriotic soldiers in the reactionary camp to turn to the people's ranks. I wish:

The success of the Political Consultative Conference!

Long live the People's Republic of China!

Long live the Communist Party of China!

Long live Chairman Mao!

Long live Commander-in-Chief Zhu!

Special Invitation Representative

Qian Changzhao Speech

Chairman, distinguished representatives:

For the past eighteen years, I have been involved in heavy industry construction work, and my heart has always been troubled. Because the Kuomintang government has always represented the interests of a very small number of people, and as for the interests of the masses, it has not been considered at all. Therefore, economic construction, especially heavy industry construction, has been out of the question.

Today's situation is completely different. The People's Political Consultative Conference has opened; the Central People's Government is about to be established; the Common Program has clearly stipulated that industry should focus on the recovery and development of heavy industry. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, under the leadership of the people's leader Chairman Mao, economic construction will definitely make great progress in the near future. Therefore, everyone who is engaged in economic construction, especially those who are engaged in heavy industry construction, is dancing with joy.

Of course, there are difficulties in the construction of China's heavy industry, but as long as we have the determination, have a plan, and do it step by step, any difficulty will be eliminated in front of us.

Today, I have a few shallow opinions to put forward for the reference of the distinguished representatives. The first point is that the Kuomintang government has not paid enough attention to resource surveys in the past, and the funds for resource surveys are very small. Therefore, we are not very clear about population, land, minerals, forests, water resources, etc. Under such circumstances, it is impossible to complete a national economic construction plan, so we should quickly carry out large-scale resource surveys. The second point is that in the next two or three years, large-scale new construction of heavy industry is almost impossible. It is urgent to reorganize and supplement the existing heavy industry. The third point is that the construction of heavy industry should be planned by the central government, and after planning, some work can be entrusted to local governments to do. If each local government builds separately and then adjusts later, it will be very uneconomical. The fourth point is that the work of planning national economic construction is very heavy. Empty plans and hasty plans have great risks. We see that the five-year plans of the Soviet Union, each plan's drafting process, how serious and thorough! We should learn from the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Union will definitely be happy to teach us. The fifth point is that the promotion of industrial construction relies on talents, so the training of workers is urgent. Other things can be saved, but the training of talents must not be saved. In addition, various industries and schools and research institutions should also be closely linked and fully coordinated to make theory and practice consistent. The sixth point is that the world's technical standards are constantly improving, and we must not grope in the dark if we can avoid it. We must catch up. The latest technology should be obtained by various means. This can speed up the industrialization of China and make economic construction not take the wrong path. The seventh point is that in large-scale industrial construction, management is more difficult than technology. The object of management is people, and the object of technology is things. We want to industrialize, we must focus on management. If various management systems are not established in industrial construction, or if there are systems but no suitable people to implement them, it will definitely fail. How to make various industries themselves become enterprises, how to make various industries no longer have waste, how to make various industries no longer have the bureaucratic style of being separated from the people, is the most urgent problem in today's industrial construction in China. The eighth point is that the mood of the staff of economic construction has a decisive relationship with the general work efficiency. Everyone should communicate their thoughts, abide by discipline, focus on management, improve technology, help each other, and trust each other, so that new and old can be integrated, and workers can be united.

I used to work in the Resources Commission. The Resources Commission is a state-owned enterprise for building heavy industry, and in the past eighteen years, I am ashamed to say that there have been no achievements, but there are many, many workers who have always adhered to the principle of not doing anything or only doing things for the country. This time, more than 200,000 workers have entered the embrace of the New Democratic state relatively intact, and their joy is indescribable. We will definitely serve the people wholeheartedly, will not let down the country, will not let down the leadership of the Communist Party, and will not let down the leadership of the people's leader Chairman Mao.

Special Invitation Representative

Zhou Xinfan Speech

Distinguished representatives:

Xinfan would like to supplement the issue of drama and politics.

China's traditional and local operas originally came from the people. Many operas can be seen as symbols of the Chinese people's suffering and genius creation, and are therefore popular among the broad masses. This power has also been noticed by the feudal rulers, who often distort and use it to consolidate their rule.

But these feudal rulers, although they also used drama as a powerful cultural tool, have always looked down on those who perform drama. The so-called "singers and actors are servants" are lumped together. From the Qing Dynasty, the Northern Warlords, to the Kuomintang's feudal fascist rule, they have consistently oppressed drama workers, especially those who want to speak for the people through drama. Therefore, in the past, drama was managed by the public security authorities. On the one hand, they regarded drama as a mere entertainment tool and not an educational tool. If your drama contains strong national consciousness and democratic thoughts, the public security authorities would be very sensitive to suppress you, and actors often ended up in prison or were killed. We have not forgotten the registration of performers held by Chiang Kai-shek after Japan's surrender when he launched a counter-revolutionary civil war. His purpose was to humiliate us on the one hand and to suppress our thoughts on the other. If you want to revolt, he would cancel your registration certificate and cut off your livelihood.

It was not until the people's revolution developed to the south that we were liberated. At the last meeting of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles, Vice Chairman Zhou's report emphasized the necessity of reforming traditional drama in the construction of New Democratic culture. He also said that the old society liked drama but looked down on drama. Today, we not only like drama but also respect drama. Therefore, we must reform drama. This time, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference was convened, and the Common Program included the development of drama and film as an important part of cultural and educational policies. We, a few traditional drama workers, were also invited to participate in this unprecedented national ceremony, which is not only an encouragement to us a few actors but also a great encouragement to the nearly one million of our entire performing arts community.

Originally, Chinese traditional drama was not completely unrelated to politics. From Yu Meng to many excellent actors, they have criticized politics through very subtle and indirect, or sharp and fierce satire. But at most, they could only satirize politics and could not participate in politics. Traditional drama actors who have the opportunity to participate in politics and even participate in such a great people's national construction, in China's five-thousand-year history, it should start from us four people—Mei Lanfang, Cheng Yanqiu, Yuan Xiaofen, and me! Traditional drama is also regarded as people's art, this is a glory that we have never had before. Of course, we know that this glory is not easily obtained. It is thanks to the blood shed by the Chinese people and patriots for nearly a hundred years for the Chinese revolution, thanks to the unyielding struggle of the Communist Party of China for twenty-eight years, thanks to the bravery and sacrifice of the People's Liberation Army, and more thanks to the wise leadership of the great people's leader Chairman Mao.

We also know that such unprecedented glory is not to be received for free. We, on this occasion, dare to make a commitment to Chairman Mao, the distinguished representatives, and the people of the whole country:

First, we will definitely mobilize all drama workers to support the great national construction work of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and learn the Common Program and other basic laws. Improve everyone's love and understanding of their country and government.

Second, we will definitely strengthen unity, strengthen learning, overcome the past scatteredness, selfishness, and individualism, use collective power to reform traditional drama, and implement the tasks specified for us in the Common Program: "Serve the people, enlighten the people's political awareness, and encourage the people's enthusiasm for labor."

Third, we will definitely break away from the past inertia and many professional prejudices, bravely and boldly learn from the people, learn from brother arts, learn from cultural heritage, learn from the excellent achievements of advanced countries, and create dramas with thought and art to match the scale of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

Long live the success of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference!

Long live the People's Republic of China!

Long live the great people's leader Chairman Mao!

　　中国人民政治协商会议第一届全体会议
    各单位代表主要发言
  　无党派民主人士首席代表
    郭沫若　发言
    中国人民政治协商会议第一届全体会议开幕了。
    这是人民中国的建国会议。大会要通过三个建国的人民大宪章，要代表全中国人民的意志宣告中华人民共和国的成立。
    我们无党派民主人士得以参加这样隆重的开国盛会，我们感觉着无上的荣幸，谨以最大的热诚庆祝大会的成功。
    三个建国的人民大宪章：
    “中国人民政协组织法”，
    “中央人民政府组织法”，
    “中国人民政协的共同纲领”，
    都是本着实事求是的精神，集思广益的办法，经过了无数次的斟酌损益，返复商讨，而草拟出来的。我们认为确实是集中了全体代表的意见，字字句句都切合着中国革命的实际需要。我们认为这确实是人民意志的总表现。我们要以最大的热诚，表示无条件的接受，彻底的拥护。
    我们是无党派民主人士，没有什么党派的意见可以代表，因而仿佛都是个人。但我们要在大会上坚决的表示：我们决不是美帝国主义所企图引诱的“民主的个人主义者”。
    “民主的个人主义”本是旧民主主义的本质，发展到了今天，若不自觉，就会发展成为“美国主义”了。以自私自利的个人主义为本位，而戴上一顶“民主”的帽子。个人主义愈彻底，“民主”帽子便愈虚伪。美帝国主义在今天就是一个好例子。美国的财权政权教育权文化权都被操纵在八大财阀集团极少数个人的手里，因而美国式的“民主”实际上是寡头专政了。
    我们中国人里面，难道还会有那样糊涂的个人主义分子，甘心做美帝国主义的第五纵队吗？
    这样的人和我们是不能两立的，我们是毛泽东的信徒，我们是民主的集体主义者。对于美帝国主义不存丝毫的幻想，也不存丝毫的恐怖。美帝国主义这只纸老虎已经戳穿了。我们今后还要继续努力地戳，戳得它遍体鳞伤，不成形状。
    我们是无党派的民主人士，因为没有党派的固定关系，似乎也就显示得都很自由。但我们再要在大会上坚决的表示：我们也决不是自以为站在中间路线上的所谓“自由主义者”。
    今天的所谓“自由主义”，其实就是“民主的个人主义”的别名。自以为站在中间，其实丝毫也不中间。美帝国主义正是欢迎这种人的，那里会“中”得起来呢？
    但我们确实是相当自由的，而且自由到了这样的程度：我们要自由自在地跟着毛主席向一边倒。
    我们在国内要自由自在地倒在中国共产党的一边，拥护中国共产党和毛主席的一切号召，拥护中国人民解放军，拥护以工人阶级为领导、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政。拥护，拥护，我们彻底的拥护。
    我们在国际要自由自在地倒在以苏联为首的民主和平阵营的一边。我们要联合苏联，学习苏联，接受苏联人民的一切宝贵经验以从事建设。我们要向苏联看齐！学习，学习，我们彻底的学习。
    中国人民从今天起已经有了自己的新的祖国。我们一定要以全生命来爱护我们的祖国，要努力实行大会的决议，遵守人民大宪章。迅速把我们人民的祖国建设成为坚强的和平堡垒。
    我们的祖国是神圣不可侵犯的，不容许有任何外来的侵略和内在的反侧。我们要时常警惕着，击破内外敌人的阴谋，并消除帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的一切可能有的祸害。
    建国事业是很光荣的，但也是很艰巨的。我们清醒地知道，在我们面前横梗着无数的困难。但我们坚决地相信，我们勤劳勇敢的中国人民，在中国共产党和毛主席的领导之下，是能够克服任何天大的困难的。
    中国共产党二十八年来的坚苦奋斗的历史教育了我们，盟邦苏联三十二年来的建国历史也教育了我们，使我们坚决地相信，在共产党的领导之下，生产力获得了彻底解放的工农大众是能够创造出无数类似神话的奇迹出来的。
    集体主义的英雄时代到来了。新生的祖国，为了建国大业的迅速成功，在呼唤着她的英雄儿女。
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    人民民主专政胜利万岁！
    伟大的人民领袖毛泽东万岁！
    上海人民团体首席代表
    刘晓　发言
    主席团、各位代表先生：
    我代表上海各人民团体，带着兴奋的心情，来讲几句话。
    首先，我们对筹备会提交大会的“共同纲领”，“人民政协组织法”，“中华人民共和国中央人民政府组织法”表示完全同意和热烈拥护！因为这是全国人民利益集中的表现，同时也是上海人民多年来奋斗的目标！
    上海人民，特别是上海工人阶级和学生，在过去的几十年中，始终是英勇坚强，不屈不挠的在那里和帝国主义，封建主义和官僚资本主义进行不断的斗争。我们都还记得：在“五卅”运动中，上海几十万的工人学生与爱国的工商业家曾以革命大团结的坚强的罢工、罢课、罢市的斗争来反对帝国主义及其走狗北洋军阀的压迫，推动了中国大革命第一个高潮。在北伐时期，上海工人又以武装起义来赶走了北洋军阀，使上海人民反对封建军阀和帝国主义的斗争，取得了伟大的胜利。“四·一二”事变，蒋介石及其所领导的国民党，叛变了革命，投降了帝国主义，篡夺了人民的胜利成果，虽使上海人民又陷于法西斯统治与帝国主义的压迫，遭受了残酷的白色恐怖，牺牲了成千成万的人民的优秀领袖，但在上海人民，首先是上海工人阶级，又在中国共产党领导下，揩干了自己身上的血迹，埋好了同伴们的尸体，仍旧坚强地站起来，不顾一切牺牲，继续反对国民党的卖国政权及帝国主义的侵略。“九一八”事变以后更实行与各民主党派、各界爱国分子和爱国军队的革命大团结。并且依靠这一革命大团结进行了“一二八”的英勇反抗日寇武装侵略的战争和抗日救国的大运动，一直到全面抗战的实现。
    在抗日战争中，上海已沦为日寇的殖民地。在上海，国民党分子一批一批投降了日寇，帮助日寇共同来摧残上海人民的抗日斗争。上海人民虽在这样的极困难条件下，仍旧勇敢地运用自己革命的经验，很灵活、很巧妙地与日寇及其走狗进行不断的斗争，使日寇在侵略战争中遭受了很大的困难。
    全国抗战是胜利了，可是国民党在美帝支援下，又阴谋进行内战。上海人民努力用一切力量与全国人民共同来争取政协的实现，反对内战的阴谋。为着如此，他们曾经在一九四六年六月二十三日举行了十万人的大示威并派遣他们自己的代表到南京进行抗议。但国民党终于不顾人民的意志，背信的、疯狂的发动了内战。上海人民并没有被吓倒，相反的，却更深刻的认识清楚，要把中国变成为一个民主独立的国家，只有彻底摧毁帝国主义，首先是美帝在中国的势力及其走狗国民党反动的统治，而这个希望也只有在中国共产党所领导的人民解放战争全面胜利时，才能实现。当然，上海人民在这几年中，始终坚决相信着，这一解放战争，是一定能够很快胜利的，因为它有毛主席的直接领导。因此，在这几年中，上海人民很有信心地和美蒋进行不断的搏斗，来配合全国的解放战争。上海人民，特别是上海工人和学生为着揭露蒋介石内战的支援者美帝的阴谋，消除人民对美帝的幻想和使人民能了解蒋匪内战的实质，曾不顾国民党任何压迫，进行了一连串反对美帝的斗争，从反对美军的各种暴行发展到驱逐美军出中国，一直到反美帝扶日的大运动，使美帝对蒋介石内战的支援受到了很大的打击。上海人民，特别是上海工人、学生为着要暴露反动派所发动的内战对广大中国人民利益的损害，为着揭破反动派掩护其内战所进行的政治欺骗，使蒋区广大人民政治觉悟更进一步提高来反对蒋介石国民党与支援我们的自卫战争，曾展开了很激烈的反内战、反饥饿、反迫害的大斗争。为着使解放战争早日胜利，上海人民，特别是上海工人和学生曾不顾一切牺牲，以坚决的斗争行动阻挠美蒋的一切反动政治、军事与经济措施，扩大解放军及解放战争的胜利宣传来动摇敌人的信心，瓦解敌人阵营，用各种各样的方式来削弱他们的战斗力，一直发展到以几十万有组织的人民力量来护厂、护校，阻止敌人对上海的破坏，保护人民国家的财产并进行必要的军事斗争来配合解放军对上海的解放。虽然在这许多斗争中，上海人民曾遭受了无比残酷的野蛮压迫，许多许多人是被关进监牢中去了，同时也有许多许多的人是被屠杀了，然而上海人民始终不屈，前仆后继，奋勇向前与敌人作不顾生死的搏斗。各位代表先生！上海人民之所以如此，是为着什么？就是为着争取今天这样的一个人民政协会议，和我们将要通过的共同纲领，以及新民主主义的人民共和国！今天这一目标，在毛主席英明领导下，在解放战争全面胜利下，是实现了！上海工人阶级，上海人民是衷心地感谢毛主席！感谢朱总司令和他们所领导的解放军！同时，我代表上海人民向毛主席、朱总司令及人民解放军致崇高的敬礼！我更向毛主席、朱总司令和大会保证上海人民会以最大决心与准备任何牺牲来保卫这一胜利！
    现在上海人民是胜利了，上海已变成人民的上海了，但帝国主义与国民党残余反动势力，是不甘心失败的。正如毛主席所指出的：他们还要作最后的挣扎，还会以各种方式从事破坏与捣乱。上海解放后所发生的银元投机、大美晚报事件、布雷的造谣，欧立夫事件等都是有计划的挑拨与阴谋捣乱的表现。可是这些都已被上海人民用自己的力量在共产党领导下一件一件为我们击破了。这样使帝国主义与国民党残余反动势力不能不拿出他们最后的一张王牌，对上海进行封锁，企图以封锁来破坏我们，困倒我们。但是上海人民，特别是上海工人阶级，从他们多年斗争的经验中，坚决相信，只要上海各界人民能进行革命大团结，是一定能战胜一切困难，粉碎敌人任何的破坏和封锁。不久以前，在上海所召开的各界人民代表会议上，就充分表现了这种精神和信心。
    各位代表先生！我们坚信：在毛主席领导下，只要我们能依靠着上海人民革命的大团结的无比力量，执行上海各界人民代表会议所通过的六大任务，我们敢于向大会保证，我们一定能粉碎敌人的封锁，能彻底贯彻大会的决议的。我们要坚决把这个过去曾为敌人的堡垒的上海，变成为人民的坚强堡垒，它将永远站在新中国最前线，高举着毛泽东的旗帜，为建设新上海，新中国而奋斗！为贯彻大会决议而奋斗！
    敬祝大会的成功！
    人民解放军第一野战军首席代表
    贺龙　发言
    主席、各位代表先生：
    我代表中国人民解放军第一野战军全体指战人员以万分兴奋、愉快、热烈的心情，庆祝这个会议的成功，并竭诚拥护由这个会议所产生的中华人民共和国及中央人民政府。
    我们代表团详细研究和讨论了人民政治协商会议的共同纲领和组织法，以及中央人民政府的组织法等文件，一致认为这是目前时期全国人民大团结的最好的组织形式和行动纲领，不但完全赞同，并将为其全部实现而努力奋斗。
    自蒋介石国民党悍然发动反革命反人民的内战以来，我们第一野战军，就一直奋战在西北战场。依靠广大人民的支援，依靠全体指战人员的英勇作战，艰苦奋斗，依靠各兄弟战场的配合，特别依靠毛主席朱总司令的英明领导和亲自指挥，我们不仅打败了胡马匪帮的严重进攻，收复了失地，大量歼灭了进攻的敌人，而且解放了广大的地区，壮大了自己。自华北兵团进军西北加入第一野战军行列后，我们的力量就更加雄伟更加壮大了，我们现在已经打到接近新疆和四川的边境去了！我们向大会保证：我们一定迅速完成解放全西北并协同兄弟部队解放全西南的任务。我们一定要解放新疆，解放四川。残留西北西南战场的敌人，如果他们不投降或不接受八条二十四款和平解决的方案，胆敢继续抵抗，我们就一定坚决、彻底、干净、全部消灭之。
    我们向大会保证：我们一定按照共同纲领上的军事制度去强化军队的建设。我们要努力提高政治觉悟，提高军事和文化，提高纪律，使我们走向进一步的正规化。这就是说：我们将是一支既具有高度的政治质量，又具有高度的近代军事技术的强大的军队。任何帝国主义者如果敢于侵犯我们神圣的国土，那么，他们将一定从此得到教训：中国人民和他自己的军队是不可侮的！
    我们第一野战军所在地区的西北，是一个土地广大、矿藏丰富、民族众多的地方，又与我们伟大的邻邦苏联紧相连接，将来在新中国的建设上，亦占着极其重要的地位。但西北富源并未开发，人民生活极苦，国民党反动派虽亦喊过什么“开发西北”的空话，而其实质是更增加西北人民的穷困和痛苦，真正开发西北的任务只有人民自己的政府才能完成。我们向大会保证：我第一野战军全体指战员除有决心迅速完成全部解放西北的光荣任务外，并决心遵照中央人民政府各项政策和措施，团结西北各民族的全体人民，努力开发西北，参加新中国的建设工作，使我们伟大的祖国从速达到独立、民主、和平、统一、富强的境地。我们人民解放军的优良传统之一就是既会打仗，又会生产，因而我们坚信：我们不仅能在军事战线上战胜敌人，而且亦能在生产建设战线上赢得胜利。
    中国人民政治协商会议成功万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    中国人民领袖毛主席万岁！
    中国人民解放军朱总司令万岁！
    中华全国总工会代表
    朱学范　发言
    主席，各位代表：
    我今天代表中华全国总工会代表中国工人阶级发言。在几天的会议上，各位代表先生的发言，都一致表示热烈拥护这次会议，这就证明：全中国人民已经在中国人民政治协商会议的旗帜下巩固的团结起来了。我们中国工人阶级对于这次中国历史上空前未有的人民政治协商会议是更加感到欣慰和愉快。对于筹备委员会提出的三大历史文件，即人民政治协商会议组织法，中央人民政府组织法与人民政治协商会议的共同纲领，我们更表示无条件的赞成与拥护！中国工人阶级，是最受压迫的一个阶级，我们受着帝国主义、封建主义与官僚资本主义的三重压迫。中国工人阶级在帝国主义，封建主义与官僚资本主义的反动统治之下，所得到的除了在经济上受压榨剥削以外，在政治上所得到的就是“二七”“五卅”“四一二”无数次的屠杀。今天在中国共产党与毛主席的英明领导之下，在中国人民解放军的帮助之下，在全国人民的大团结与国际友人的援助之下，来了一个大翻身，一下子使我们这个被压在十八层地狱中的中国工人阶级翻到顶上来了，使我们由奴隶变成了社会国家的主人。在这次会议所要讨论并通过的三大历史文献中，中国工人阶级受到空前未有的尊重，而被放在国家的领导地位，我们是感到无上的欣慰与光荣，同时也感到很大的恐惧。我们在国家社会中的被推崇的地位愈高，我们对于国家社会所应负的责任也就愈重。我们要本着毛主席所经常告诉我们的谨慎谦虚不骄不躁的训示，我们要发挥我们工人阶级所固有的自我牺牲精神，在工作中要抱着“吃苦在前，享乐在后”的态度，在新中国的建设事业中，特别是在恢复与发展生产的经济建设事业中，我们要与全国人民一道，为彻底实现全部共同纲领，特别是纲领中全部经济政策而奋斗。使落后的农业的中国变为先进的工业的中国，使中国人民不仅在政治上而且在经济上站立起来。这一任务是艰巨的，不是某一个阶级所能单独的完成的。但我们中国工人阶级深信，只要我们能与广大的中国人民巩固地团结在一起，再加上国际友人，首先是苏联的援助，坚决遵照毛主席所指示我们的道路前进，胜利就一定是我们的。这是我们中国工人阶级对于这次会议所要表示的信心与决心。我们高呼：
    中国人民的大团结万岁！
    中国人民政治协商会议万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    伟大的人民领袖毛主席万岁！
    　　　　特别邀请代表
    特别邀请代表
　　陈明仁　发言
    主席，诸位代表先生：
    中国人民政治协商会议的任务，是要结束帝国主义、封建主义、和官僚资本主义在中国的统治，从而建立一个以工人阶级为领导，工农联盟为基础，团结各民主阶级各民族的人民民主专政的独立、民主、和平、统一和富强的新中国。这是划时代的盛典。本人承蒙特别邀请出席，引为非常荣幸。由于毛主席的贤明领导，解放军的英勇奋斗，广大人民的支援，各民主力量的配合，才获得今日光辉灿烂的成就。谨向伟大的领袖毛主席表示极诚恳的感谢和崇高的敬意！
    本届会议所提出的三大草案，经过筹委会反复研讨，确实能够针对中国社会和人民的需要，没有一句不合实际的高调，不但是保护中国人民利益的大宪章，而且将成为人类历史上非常重大的政治文献，因为它们在中国尽了改革社会改变历史的任务，指示着我们的中国四万万七千五百万人口的大翻身，向着独立、自由、民主、和平、统一、富强的前途迈进，我表示衷心的赞成和拥护；尤其共同纲领中规定了的军事制度，乃为人民解放战争进行到底的一种行动轨范，我以军人身份更要竭诚拥护，并为其全部实现而努力。
    新的中国虽然诞生，但还有若干地区急切等待解放，而且顽固的反动分子向来至死不悟，所以非将战争进行到底予以彻底肃清，他们是不会放弃其最后挣扎的。因此，我觉得我们的解放战争还需要继续发展，还需要继续努力。在残余的反动派里面，有些是罪魁祸首，罪在不赦；也有些是中了反动宣传的毒素，或者是被威力挟持，没有适当机会可以自拔。对于这后面一类的人，为了缩短战争，为了保存元气，我们应该本着毛主席宽大为怀的意旨，去唤醒他们，挽救他们，引导他们向人民靠拢，走向光明的道路。
    我是一个军人，我是黄埔第一期的一个学生，本来是以卫国救民为天职的，二十多年来，参加北伐，参加抗日，打了不少的硬仗。不料蒋介石在抗日胜利后撕毁了政协，发动内战，他欺骗我们，驱使我到东北与解放军连年苦战，我仍旧出死力替他打了好些硬仗。那时我目击战争的残酷，人民的痛苦，对于蒋介石所坚持的内战，便由怀疑而厌恶起来了，因而和各方面多接触，也渐渐觉悟起来了。所以今年二月回到长沙，我便决心在程潜将军领导之下，拥护和平主张，脱离反动政府。这时我只是为了人民痛苦水深火热，实在不堪再战，但对中共的真象我还不很明白，我想只要人民真正获得解放，我个人便遭受中共的严厉惩处，也是甘心的。后来因为白崇禧匪军退入湘境，挟持我们，我们没法行动，直到八月初解放军逼走了白军，我们才得起义。这时蒋介石只知道程潜将军主张和平，还不明白我的态度，在起义前两天，他还派员送电报给我，要我“大义灭亲”。因为程潜将军是我进黄埔以前的老校长，意思是叫我杀害程将军。他并要我率部十万死守长沙，不惜全军牺牲；如果不决心守长沙，便退湘西，把和平分子一律“明正典刑”。我记得我在黄埔的时候，蒋介石经常对我们说：“我是革命的，实行三民主义的，我什么时候不革命，你们应该打倒我。”我现在发现了蒋介石不仅是不革命，简直是反革命，简直是人民的公敌，我当然要打倒他。并且不但我要打倒他，就是凡是黄埔学生乃至全国人民，都要起而打倒他的。他是我们的校长，现在我便给他一个“大义灭亲”，我想蒋介石用不着怨恨我，应该去怨恨他自己。
    当时，白崇禧也派专机送来一个命令，叫我派兵包围程潜将军所住的水陆洲，实行兵谏，必要时采断然处置。我起了义，对白崇禧何尝不是兵谏，可惜他冥顽不灵，兵谏于他又有什么用？
    我上面说过，在起义前，我只是为了人民，甘愿牺牲自己，那时对中共真象，确实还不很明白。直到解放军进驻长沙以后，才确实了解中国共产党和解放军的伟大，对我们起义军多方爱护，多方帮助，犹如兄弟手足一样，一切措施，都极其公平，一直到现在，我没有发现共产党一桩不合理的事。我多年在蒋政权之下，徘徊惶惑，到现在才如大梦初醒，才走向真正的革命方面来。在黑暗中挣扎过多少年的我，一旦获得光明，今后可以大步迈进，我的心情，是多么愉快，多么兴奋。尤其来到北平，目击各党派，各团体，各阶层人士聚集一堂，那样谐和，那样振奋，那样勤谨朴素，确是生平所未见过，这是中国有史以来第一次人民大团结。这是一股不可阻挡的洪流，拿来肃清残余反动力量，拿来抵御外侮，拿来建设新中国，都是绰有余裕的。诚如毛主席所说：“我们的民族将再也不是一个被人侮辱的民族了，我们已经站起来了”。
    过去我盲从蒋介石个人，内心非常痛苦，但，我在他的欺骗之下，还是替他们打了不少的硬仗，这是我的一种错误，也可说是一种对人民应该担负的罪过。现在我已站在人民方面来了，一切服从人民，在人民政府指挥之下，在贤明的领袖毛主席朱总司令领导之下，我相信更能发挥我的勇气，贯彻我原来参加革命的初衷。今后打两广，打川康滇黔，打台湾，我一定更要追随解放军各位前辈之后拼命去打，务使残余反动势力完全崩溃，战争彻底胜利。同时我愿意完全接受毛主席的理论与实践统一的思想，虚心学习，努力实践，改造我自己，改造我所统率的部队，绝对以不怕死不怕苦的精神来完成我们革命军人的任务。
    中国人民政治协商会议万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    毛主席朱总司令万岁！
    华北解放区首席代表
    薄一波　发言
    各位主席、各位代表先生们：
    华北代表团经过数日来详细的讨论，完全同意筹备会所提出的政协组织法、政府组织法和共同纲领。我们认为这三个文件是总结了中国人民一百零九年以来的斗争经验，是完满无缺地提出了中国人民在现时期的革命要求，是中国人民长期奋斗所获得的大宪章。我谨代表华北六千七百万人民竭诚拥护，并以最大努力把共同纲领的内容和精神贯彻到华北的整个工作中去。（⑵⑶）
    十四年前，毛主席所领导的从南方发展起来的人民解放军开到了北方，立即实行唤起民众，掀起了人民革命的浪潮，这才使落后的北方变成为进步的北方，并在八年抗战和三年解放战争中间，能够首先推翻了帝国主义和国民党反动统治。南方人帮助了北方人，这一点，北方人是永远不会忘记的。华北解放区大部是老解放区，它已经按照中国土地法大纲实行了土地改革，实现了耕者有其田，人民群众已经站起来了；它远在抗战期间就实行了发展生产保障供给的方针；它在中共领导下，组织了百万以上的人民解放军；它从抗战开始就实行了包括工农兵学商及各少数民族的民族民主统一战线。有了这几条就能够使我们胜利地进行了并支援了八年抗战和三年解放战争。虽然华北解放区在战争中所受敌人摧残极为严重，敌我斗争极为残酷，农业生产降低到战前水平的百分之六十，农民负担加重到其总收入的百分之二十到三十，但华北人民以其自己十二年斗争的亲身经验证明，诚如毛主席在开幕词中所指出的一样，有信心并有决心，可以克服任何困难，继续支援前线，肃清反动派残余力量，解放全中国，并将继续在经济建设文化建设的战线上获得进步的胜利。
    华北六千七百万人民将以实际行动，来拥护中国人民政治协商会议第一届全体会议的一切决议。
    我们，在中央人民政府领导下，决心：在两年内把农业生产全部恢复到战前水平，努力增产粮食和经济作物。争取在五年到十年内有计划有步骤地恢复并改组华北的工业生产，发展起重工业来，做到完全改变依靠帝国主义的状态。改变过去不合理的城乡关系，做到城乡互助、经济交流，农村以粮食和经济作物支援城市，城市以农具，机器和工业必需品供给农村，在经济互助的坚实的基础上，巩固工农联盟。进一步建设与加强华北人民民主专政的政权，不论老解放区或新解放区，一律于今冬明春普遍建立起村、区、县三级人民代表大会或各界人民代表会议，并准备在明年召开各省人民代表大会。提高科学文化水平，加强技术教育，尽可能快地推行普及教育。继续加强地方武装和群众工作，进行肃清土匪和肃清特务分子。安定革命秩序，务使各业各界均能安心建设工作。
    华北解放区军民，在十二年的革命战争中，已经发扬了它高度的积极性和英勇牺牲不屈不挠的精神，已经对人民革命事业有了一定的贡献。但我们决不能以此自满，我们在工作中曾经犯过若干错误，就是在现在工作中也还存在着许多缺点，今后我们将永远遵照毛主席的指示“戒骄戒躁，谨慎谦虚”，兢兢业业地执行此次人民政协大会所规定的各种政策，更好地为完成共同纲领所给予我们的任务而奋斗。
    少数民族首席代表
    刘格平　发言
    主席，各位代表，各位来宾先生：
    中国人民政治协商会议，是在中国人民解放战争的伟大胜利和全国人民空前大团结的基础之上召开的，它标志着我们中国的历史从此完全进入到人民民主和民族平等的时期，我们各少数民族代表参加了这次会议，真正平等的和与会的其他代表先生们共同商讨建设新中国的大政方针，我们感到非常荣幸和愉快！
    这次政协会议的共同纲领，政府组织法，政协组织法三个文献中的每一句话，都反映了中国人民（少数民族在内）长期斗争所得到的成果，我们觉得这三个文献是中国人民的灯塔，我们各少数民族要百分之百地、全心全意地拥护它，执行它。
    各个少数民族的自由解放，与整个中国人民的自由解放是不可分的。
    蒋介石实行大汉族主义的反动统治，勾结着各少数民族中的封建上层败类，如蒙族中的德王（德穆楚克）、白云梯；回族中的白崇禧、马步芳、马鸿逵等等，彝、苗民族中的土司；以及各民族中的恶霸、地主等进行屠杀、欺骗、奴役、分化和剥削压迫，使各民族的人民互相隔离，造成仇恨。在这种情况下，各个少数民族人民，当然是要要求自决，要求脱离开帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义三位一体的统治。
    在外蒙古独立自决后，他们的人民不是早已得到自由解放了吗？
    但是，在今天我们所处的情况已经完全不同了。在解放的地区，少数民族的中心任务，是区域自治和民族团结。我们看：
    第一，我们的人民解放军是正在迅速的消灭着蒋匪残余，向着西北（也要迅速和新疆民主力量相汇合）、西南、华南及台湾等地区大进军中，要将这些少数民族内外的敌人和他们的帮凶们加以斩草除根，打倒障碍我们各民族人民团结的害虫们，使我们中国各民族人民能够团结在这个中华民族的大家庭里。
    第二，在中国人民革命的八年抗战，三年解放战争的伟大胜利中，各个少数民放人民，在华北、华东、东北、西北各解放区中，与整个中国人民团结在一起，出生入死的共同奋斗，打破了一切民族间的隔阂；很多的组织了人民武装部队，进行土地改革，发展生产，支援前线。
    第三，解放区的少数民族，在政治上、经济上、文化上得到了平等的地位，实行村、乡、街的自治，以保障了少数民族的权益。在统一的国家军事制度之下，可以参加人民解放军，可以组织民族的公安部队，以保卫各少数民族人民生命财产的安全。
    在内蒙，自治区建立已经有两年多了，这是少数民族自治的最好范例，这是在中国共产党和毛主席领导下的民族政策的具体表现。
    因此，我们要特别警惕国民党匪帮和美、英（他们正在西藏搞阴谋）各帝国的挑拨分裂各民族人民的团结。今天，已经明确的规定在共同纲领中的民族政策，是我们各少数民族人民几百年以来，流血奋斗所争取的目标，今天终究实现了，我们是百分之百的同意和拥护它，眼看着我们各个少数民族和整个中国人民的光明幸福前途，我们有说不出的愉快和兴奋！
    最后，各个少数民族的广大人民，每个人都必须宝贵和珍视这个人民自己的大宪章，并为其彻底实现而奋斗！“反对大民族主义和狭隘民族主义，禁止民族间歧视、压迫和分裂各民族团结的行为。”必须协同人民解放军肃清各民族内外的人民公敌，粉碎并驱逐帝国主义的阴谋和侵略，将革命进行到底，才能有计划、有步骤地努力完成我们的和平建设。这个共同纲领所确定的方向，对于我们还是一个特别艰巨的任务，我们深信在共产党及毛主席英明的领导下，一定能够克服一切困难，获得伟大的成功！
    庆祝中华人民共和国的成立！
    庆祝中国人民政治协商会议的成功！
　　中国民主促进会首席代表
    马叙伦　发言
    各位代表先生们：
    全国人民渴望的中国政治协商会议，已经开幕了。这是由于中国人民解放战争和人民革命的伟大胜利所获得的。不但我们全体代表们在这儿欢欣鼓舞，开会的消息传到那儿，那儿的人民也大大地欢欣鼓舞。现在本席代表中国民主促进会敬致庆贺的热忱，并向领导人民获得伟大胜利的中国共产党和英明的中国人民领袖毛主席致敬！
    我们认为那三个即将在大会上通过的，揭开中国新历史的文件——中国人民政治协商会议组织法，中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领，中华人民共和国中央人民政府组织法——是中国人民民主统一战线胜利的产物，我们热烈地予以拥护。
    中国人民历来受封建势力的压迫，一百多年来，更受了帝国主义的侵略，中国各阶层的人民，包括民族资产阶级在内，都受到它们的迫害，因此，对于帝国主义和封建制度，都有着程度不同的反抗性和革命性。可是没有无产阶级的领导，中国反帝反封建的革命是不能成功的。中国资产阶级也曾经发动过革命，但是一旦政权在手，就跟帝国主义和封建势力妥协，而且被大地主大资产阶级掌握了领导权，压迫人民，屠杀人民，剥削人民。现在可不同了，我们已经形成了以工人阶级领导的，以工农联盟为基础的人民民主统一战线！我们不但得到了胜利，而且能够巩固这个胜利，开始建设新中国。这是有保证的，因为有中国共产党在领导我们。
    中国人民政治协商会议的意义是有世界性的。中国人民的胜利，对于保卫世界和平有着巨大的贡献，对于东方被压迫民族的解放运动给予一个极大的鼓励，对于帝国主义殖民地的统治，给予一个严重的打击。
    中国是半殖民地半封建的、工业落后的国家。革命胜利以后最重要的任务是生产建设。所以我们必须共同来鼓励私人资本，及海外华侨与国家资本有计划地合作，发展工业。我们相信：新民主主义中国的民族资本家与英美旧民主主义的资本家不同。英美资本家是专为个人利益打算，对于国计民生，他们是不管的。我们的民族资本家的利益与国家民族的利益是分不开的，所以必能依据共同纲领的经济政策来合力建设工业化的新中国。
    在思想方面，我们更当注意所谓“民主的个人主义”的思想，要是不把英美旧民主主义的思想加以澄清，这种思想就会残留下来的。所以我们必须加紧学习马列主义，毛泽东思想，并广大地推行这种教育；大家要在密切团结之下，改造自己，在新民主主义的共同目标下面全心全意为人民服务，使类似发生于匈牙利的国际大阴谋，在中国没有空子可钻！
    现在人民革命胜利了，民主联合政府就要宣告成立。但是目前伟大的胜利，正如毛主席说，“只是万里长征走完了第一步”。因此在会议以后，我们还得认真地把中国人民政治协商会议的意义，共同纲领的精神和内容，中华人民共和国政权的特征，向群众传达，并贯彻实行会议的决议，使全国人民在中央人民政府的政权底下，更能团结一致，一面来肃清反动派的残余力量，铲除以美国为首的帝国主义在中国的势力，使美帝和反动派的任何阴谋，无隙可乘；一面用最大的努力，从事于经济建设与文化建设，共同建立光辉灿烂的中华人民共和国。
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    中国共产党和人民领袖毛主席万岁！
    中国人民政治协商会议成功万岁！
    各解放区农民团体首席代表
    张晔　发言
    诸位代表先生们：
    我代表农民，把我们农民的心情讲一讲。
    反动统治宣告死亡了，农民痛苦结束了！
    我们农民“造反”，反了一代一代又一代，都只落得个悲惨的失败，一直反到毛主席时代，在共产党毛主席领导下，我们才反成了功，我们才翻过身来了！
    在没有共产党毛主席领导的那些朝代里，我们农民每一次起来暴动，“造反”，结局都只落得个悲惨的失败。
    毛主席领导我们，经过了三个革命阶段了。我们经过了土地革命战争，抗日战争，和今天的人民解放战争，我们已能觉悟起来，组织起来，我们已经再不是人家讥笑的一盘散沙，我们已经变成了一个强大的铁拳了。
    大家都看见，为了保证战争胜利，我们农民踊跃地把几百万的子弟，送去参加人民解放军，在战争紧急的时期，有时我们所有的青壮年都去支援前线了。为了保证前线战士能够吃得饱，我们宁可自己过刻苦的生活，把多余的粮食全部献出。在后方，我们组织妇女老幼，严防特务，勤劳生产。在蒋介石匪帮，拿黄河淹我们的时候，我们就拼命抢修，仅仅从济南至黄河口这一段，我们就动员了一千四百余万人工，两万万余斤粮食，才抢修了黄河，战胜了那困难危险。总之，我们有毛主席领导，我们就能克服了一切的困难，就能争得伟大的胜利。
    在今后，内部和外部敌人，是决不会甘心失败的，一定要用千方百计来破坏我们的；同时建设途中，我们的困难还多，但我们确信，在毛主席领导下，发挥大家的力量，一定能打败一切敌人，克服任何困难，达到最后胜利！
    毛主席万岁！我们永远跟着你走！
    朱总司令万岁！我们把我们的子弟交给你，保卫胜利的果实！
    人民共和国万岁！我们把我们的粮食和工业原料交给你，建设富强的新中国！
    我们全体农民代表，就是抱着这样的心情来参加这个大会的，我们研究了大会的三个文件——政协组织法，人民中央政府组织法，共同纲领——根据我们农民代表每个的经验，都一致认为：这三个历史性的文件，已经包括了我们农民的利益。我们农民利益，与全体人民利益，和各民族的利益，是完全一致的。因此我们完全同意，我们坚决拥护，愿为它的彻底实现去奋斗！
    第一，我们一定继续支援前线，将人民革命战争进行到底，争取最后胜利！
    第二，我们要有步骤地，彻底摧毁封建制度，贯彻土地改革，实现耕者有其田。
    第三，我们要在自己的土地上，努力生产，大量生产粮食与工业原料，为国家工业化而奋斗。
    我们完全懂得，毛主席是我们农民的导师，工人阶级是我们的老大哥。只有依靠先进的工人阶级兄弟，恢复和发展工业建设，才能改造农村落后的生产方式和生活方式，才能使我们最后超脱贫困。
    我们热烈欢迎知识界文化界，发挥你们的天才，拿科学技术文化各方面来帮助我们，我们农民的脑筋已经开化了，今后还要大大地开化。因为我们要开展广大的农村生产运动，为工业建设树立一个可靠的基础，所以我们要提高文化，学习科学。
    我们恳切希望工商业界，大量生产为农民需要的东西，在城乡互助，等价交换的原则下，使我们能共同繁荣，达到促进整个社会经济发展的目的。
    最后，我们农民愿与一切民主阶级和国内各民族，亲密地团结起来，为彻底实现共同纲领努力奋斗！

    邓宝珊　发言
    主席，各位代表先生们：
    中国人民政治协商会议，在全国人民的热烈盼望下，在全世界爱好和平的人民热烈盼望下，胜利地召开了，这是一件历史上空前的大事。英勇的中国人民，不仅打垮了帝国主义的武装干涉，打垮了国民党反动派的血腥统治，而且开始建设自己的独立、民主、和平、幸福的新中国了。
    感谢毛主席、朱总司令、中国共产党、人民解放军和中国人民的宽大，使我能够毅然脱离国民党反动派的羁绊，获得新生；使我能够参加划时代的中国人民政治协商会议；使我能够追随各位代表先生之后，向各位代表先生学习。
    过去，国民党反动派常常宣传新中国没有民主，没有自由；一直到现在，它们还在这样的宣传。因此，今天，我要在中国人民政治协商会议的讲台上，在全国人民面前，揭穿这种无耻的谎言。我要向全国人民宣告：不要民主，不要自由的，正是反动派自己！新中国不但有充分的民主和自由，而且对于一切过去有错误的人，只要他勇于改正，都给予自新的机会，不咎既往，今天的我，就是一个明显的例子！
    我愿意劝告西北、西南、华南、台湾等待解放区的真正的爱国分子，不要徘徊，不要犹豫，赶快冲破黑暗，走向光明，坚决的，毫无保留的向人民靠拢！
    这一次，傅作义将军和我到绥远的时候，国民党反动派起初千方百计的拉拢我们，拉拢不成，又指使它们的走狗发传单，贴标语，故意忽视北平的和平解放是全国人民一致的愿望，却说我们出卖了北平，又要出卖绥远，想这样的来破坏绥远军民的起义。可是，绥远的人民和军队，清楚的知道，究竟谁正在出卖台湾？！谁正在出卖西藏？！他们清楚的知道，我们所反对的，正是这些出卖中国领土主权给帝国主义的反动派！因此，今后，我们还是要继续反对下去的，直到这些卖国贼在中国土地上完全被肃清为止！
    各位代表先生们，今天我们中国有了这样一位英明的人民领袖——毛主席，有了这样一个坚强的人民政党——中国共产党，有了这样一支无敌的人民军队——人民解放军，有了这样许多为统一战线奋斗的民主党派和民主人士，以及四万万七千五百万觉醒的人民，我坚决的相信：独立、民主、和平、繁荣的新中国必将永远屹立于世界。让那些国内外反动派在人民面前发抖吧，我们高呼：
    中国人民政治协商会议胜利成功！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    毛主席朱总司令万岁！
    特别邀请代表
    孙兰峰　发言
    主席团，各位代表先生：
    我今天参加人民政治协商会议，感觉十分荣幸，同时，也感觉十分惭愧。
    人民政治协商会议，是全国人民空前的大团结，是多少年来中国人民所追求的理想的实现；现在，新中国诞生了，根据人民政协组织法，中央人民政府组织法，和共同纲领三个大宪章，新中国的独立、民主、和平、统一与富强，更得到确实的保证。
    我是一个行伍出身的军人，在一个星期以前，还是罪恶的反动集团一分子，反动派曾拼命的使用挑拨、分化、欺骗、破坏，种种的卑鄙手段，阻止我走向人民的阵营，直到本月十九日，我才随同董其武将军率部起义。毛主席的宽大政策，不但不究既往；而且我还能参加这个神圣的人民政协会议，我真感到无限兴奋。
    我过去参加革命工作三十多年，是信仰孙中山先生革命的三民主义，如果能彻底实行中山先生的主张，中国当可早日成为一个独立富强的国家；无如以蒋介石为首的反动集团，背叛革命，背叛中山先生，投靠美帝国主义，发动反人民的内战。幸而有伟大的毛主席和中国共产党的领导，全国人民的共同努力，对帝国主义，封建主义，和官僚资本主义，彻底的予以扫除，我们今天才有这个人民政治协商会议的召开，才能建立一个以工人阶级为领导，工农联盟为基础，团结各民主阶级及各民族的中华人民共和国。
    但是，革命工作是艰巨的，将来的障碍还不少，我们必须在毛主席、朱总司令的领导下，依照我们会议制定的三大方案，坚定信心，充实力量，争取新民主主义之胜利！我个人更要努力向人民学习，向毛主席学习，向各位先生们学习，为建设独立、民主、和平、统一、富强的中华人民共和国而奋斗。我们高呼：
    中国人民政治协商会议万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    毛主席朱总司令万岁！
    中国国民党民主促进会代表
　　蒋光鼐　发言
    主席，各位代表先生：
    本人非常的欣幸能参加这次大会。正如一个在黑暗中摸索了多年的人，突然看见了光明一样。即将通过于大会的“中国人民政治协商会议组织法”，“中华人民共和国中央人民政府组织法”和“中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领”三草案，就是这光辉灿烂明灯的标志！我感到兴奋，愉快，衷心地表示拥护，并愿为其澈底实现而奋斗到底！
    自辛亥革命时代以迄于国民革命时代，华南各省曾是孙中山先生树起革命旗帜与北洋军阀搏斗的根据地，华南各省人民和革命军人亦曾在孙先生指导之下有过光荣的英勇的反帝反封建的斗争事迹。现在以战犯蒋介石为首的国民党反动派残余，竟妄想以华南西南各省为其反革命基地作垂死的挣扎，进一步出卖祖国和奴役人民，这不仅是华南各省人民所切齿痛恨的，也应是曾经有过光荣的革命历史的革命军人所切齿痛恨的。
    因此在人民政治协商会议的今天，我愿敬告华南待解放区国民党系统下的军人们：光明已经照耀着中国，时机已不许你们彷徨，更不许你们观望！为了大家在中国革命中曾经有过一段光荣的历史，为了华南各省区的迅速解放的早日实现，你们必须认清现实，向北平看齐，向长沙看齐，向绥远看齐！你们将是决心追随蒋介石匪帮埋葬自己呢？还是坚决站在人民一边来呢？这是最后抉择的时机了！
    我更愿敬告华南待解放区的同胞们：你们在中国革命斗争中，有光荣的传统，这传统正在被美帝走狗蒋介石，李宗仁，阎锡山及反动分子所摧毁，你们也应该起来了，配合华南已解放地区的军民，配合南下的解放大军，粉碎蒋介石反动统治，粉碎美帝国主义妄图扶植所谓“个人民主主义”的阴谋！
    中华人民共和国就要成立了！中国人民就要完全翻身了！最后解放华南西南的斗争，就要象狂风暴雨一样的到来，有过光荣历史的华南军人、人民赶快站起来，迎接正在南下的解放军，迎接中华人民共和国的诞生！迎接有史以来的，全国人民的大解放！
    特别邀请代表
    黄绍＠　发言
    主席，各位代表先生：
    我被邀参加这次中国人民政治协商会议，在开幕的时候听了毛主席的开会词，这几天里听了各位代表的讲话，令我非常之兴奋！
    在这次政治协商会议里，诚如毛主席所说的将要制定中国人民政治协商会议的组织法，制定中华人民共和国中央人民政府的组织法，制定中国人民政治协商会议的共同纲领，选举中国人民政治协商会议的全国委员会，选举中华人民共和国中央人民政府委员会，制定中华人民共和国的国旗和国徽，决定中华人民共和国国都的所在地以及采取和世界大多数国家一样的年号。
    我认为这是中国人民从来没有的最伟大的力量的结合和表现，这样伟大力量的结合和表现，决不是那些反动派残余力量可以抵抗得住的，也决不是任何帝国主义者可以阻止得住的！
    这次中国人民政治协商会议的完满成功，不仅是我们到会的代表们及已经解放地区的同胞们，热烈的庆祝，和真诚的拥护，而未曾解放的地方，如“广东”“广西”“云南”“贵州”“四川”“西康”“新疆”“台湾”等省一亿以上的同胞们，他们正期待着这个伟大力量的到来！使他们早日得到解放！他们必定的更加的拥护这个大会所产生的果实。
    蒋介石及他的走狗们一向以欺骗的手段来奴役未解放地区的同胞的，尤其对于这一次大会也一定用种种方法来诋毁和诅咒，以图达到再欺骗的目的的！我想趁此机会来揭穿他们卑鄙的欺骗阴谋，希望未解放地区的同胞们，军队的同胞们，机关的同事们，大家起来推翻反动派的残余力量，共同来建设新民主主义的新中国！
    当全国人民希望和平的时候，那些反动派就想利用和平来作军事失败的掩护，但是那种假和平终归不能养息惨败的创伤而继续失败了。现在又想利用战争来苟延他的残喘，我敢肯定的说，不管他们利用任何的方法逃到任何的地方，希图保存反动的力量，抗拒人民伟大的力量，结果都是幻想的，都是失败的！只有翻然改悟和人民的力量靠拢在一起，才能真正的存在，才有光明的前途！
    中国人民的度量是宽大的，毛主席的政策是宽大的，只要翻然改图，他将不究既往的一样可以回到人民温暖的怀抱里面。我在各地见不到那一些起义附义而不得其所的官兵和公务员！
    在解放区内我所见到的工业农业以及各种公用事业，已经大踏步的进展，它不仅以恢复战前的标准为满足，而且有些地方在效率上方法上规律上已较战前进步得多。这种惊人成绩的演出，不是由于外来物质的帮助，而是由于毛主席及他领导下的共产党政治领导的正确，人民自己作了主人，各人认清了自己应尽的责任而努力得来的结果。这真正是新中国的曙光，这种曙光将随中国人民政治协商会议的完满成功，如日中天的光芒四射起来！
    我在已经解放的各大都市里，看到各种措施都很合情合理的进行着。他们对于社会上的习惯，即使在本质上认为是不良的，也顾虑到那些从业人们的生活，先由心理的转变，风气的转变，而达到职业的转变，他们决不以个人或少数人的好恶，象蒋介石一样凭一纸命令，就解决什么问题的。
    中国共产党领导下的工作人员，不论文员、武员，正在各地展开了为人民而服务的伟大精神，凡是由蒋管区到来的人们都深深地感觉到惊异的满意！他们有计划的、周到的、虚心的、热诚的、坦白的作风，不但使得受到他们服务的人衷心的敬佩！而且还有许多可歌可泣的事迹，写在人们的面前！
    他们不是某些人对某些人在感情上表示自私的好感，而是整个的对整个人群，发挥他们的伟大的服务精神，他们这种精神的高度发展，就是建设新民主主义、新中国有力的保证。
    欺骗是掩不了真理的！狡辩是胜不了事实的，假使反动派的重要分子能到这里来，只要他们的良心还未泯灭，一定会感觉到不安，一定会得到觉悟的反省。被欺骗的同胞们！我决不敢在你们面前说假话，我是凭着真理来追求事实的，现在事实已经证明了，请你们大家不要怀疑再受那些反动派的欺骗，大家一致起来吧！打倒那些反动派的骗子！大家共同在毛主席领导之下，完成建设新民主主义的新中国！
    中国人民政治协商会议正在开幕，也很快的完满成功，我愿意为这个会议尽我最大的努力，尤其愿追随全体代表全国各民主党派之后，坚决地拥护中国人民政治协商会议的决议，来完成建设独立自由平等统一富强的新中国！
    北平天津两直属市首席代表
    黄敬　发言
    主席团和各位代表先生：
    我们平津区代表团一致拥护毛泽东主席开幕词中的英明指示。
    中国人民所以能有这样伟大的团结，所以能够战胜这样强大的敌人取得这样空前的胜利完全是由于中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导，由于中国人民解放军的英勇作战，由于各民主党派各民主阶级的团结与共同努力的结果。这个伟大的胜利使我们有充分的信心来建设新的中国。我们坚信在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，大家继续团结一致，新中国的建设也一定能够成功。
    我们代表团全体代表都完全同意大会的三大文件。因为它充分反映了人民的需要。这三个文件的制定就是最完满地奠定了全国人民大团结的政治基础和组织基础。它是巩固中国人民胜利的成果与建设新中国的重要保证。因此我们希望这三大文件能在大会上顺利通过，我们决心为其实现而奋斗。
    我们代表平津四百万人民向大会声明与保证：
    我们一定在伟大的人民国家建设事业中，努力把北平天津两市的经济工作和文化工作作好。我们并努力支援前线，争取全国早日完全解放。在经济工作中，我们要本着公私兼顾，劳资两利，城乡互助，内外交流的政策努力地正确处理各种复杂的经济关系，以便生产能够迅速的发展。在文化工作中，我们努力发展新民主主义的文化教育，普遍地发展为人民服务的思想，大量培养建国人才，以符合新中国建设的需要。
    过去我们的城市因为被敌人盘据着，使城市在革命的贡献上比乡村要少，但在今后建设中我们绝不再落后，我们要努力赶上乡村，我们还要争取比乡村贡献的更多，只有这样才能完成中国工业化的任务。
    平津两市解放以来得到乡村及其他地区特别是东北很多支持，我们感激他们的支持。我们应努力恢复与发展生产，力求以物美价廉的物品供给农村，并努力满足乡村对城市的其他需要。我们希望今后更发展我们与乡村，与其他地区的互助关系。
    我们热烈拥护中华人民共和国定都在北平，我们相信这是全国人民一致的愿望，我们更感觉这是我们平津人民无上的光荣。
    我们决不松懈我们自己的警惕性，我们要积极防止与镇压反动派的阴谋破坏，肃清一切潜伏的敌人，巩固我们的首都，保卫我们的建设。
    我们是处在中央人民政府的所在地区，更得到中央人民政府的直接领导，我们完全有信心把这两个城市建设好，我们将无保留地执行这次人民政协的全部决议并准备一切来接受和完成中央人民政府所给予我们的一切任务。
    上海各人民团体代表
    朱俊欣　发言
    主席团各位代表先生：
    我代表上海工人来讲几句话：
    我们工人阶级在国民党反动统治下，是他们最看不起的奴隶，但是今天在共产党毛主席领导之下，我们却变成了主人。今天我们工人阶级能派代表来参加中国人民政治协商会议讨论国家大事，我们首先应该向毛主席朱总司令以及他们所领导的人民解放军表示无限的感激并致崇高的敬礼。
    上海是一个全国工人最集中的城市。由于上海过去的表面繁荣，是建筑在依靠帝国主义和官僚资本主义的经济基础之上。现在美国帝国主义帮助他的走狗国民党反动派，利用这个弱点，来封锁我们的海口，企图阻碍我们工业建设和发展生产。这是敌人想以封锁来难倒我们。不错，困难是有的，但我们决不怕，只有使我们更坚决的和他们斗争。
    我们曾记得，在国民党反动统治时期内，国民党反动派对我们工人用秘密的公开的逮捕和枪杀，我们牺牲了很多人，但并没有吓退，反而更积极的斗争，真能做到一个人倒下去，千万个人站起来，有信心的和各界人民团结一致，终于得到了胜利，现在难道还怕什么？
    敌人的封锁，他封锁不了我们的两只手。在今天我们只有更努力来发展生产，支援人民解放战争；在毛主席的胜利旗帜之下，将革命战争进行到底，使全中国很快的解放！
    对今后的建设工作，我们工人一定能刻苦耐劳和全国人民团结在一起，努力的自力更生，打破敌人的封锁，建设人民的新上海和新中国，巩固我们的胜利。
    今天上海在私营企业中，虽然还存在着劳资纠纷，但今后只要双方了解，在新民主主义政权领导下，拿出协议的精神，是一定能够解决的。我们工人在今天还自然也免不了有很多的缺点，希望各界给我们多多的指导。
    今后我们工人和产业界的关系，非常密切，要加紧团结，渡过目前的困难，实现共同纲领，我们工人要加倍努力，加倍学习，做到人民的模范，这样我们才不愧新中国的工人。
    我们向大会保证，我们要把大会的精神和决议，带到上海各工厂中去，使上海一百万工人，明了自己的历史任务，发挥劳动的热忱，提高生产力，为建设新上海新中国而奋斗。
    我们高呼：
    中国人民政治协商会议万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    中国人民领袖毛主席万岁！
  　农民代表
    李秀真　发言
    我来参加大会，很高兴，全国人民都高兴。
    在八年抗日战争中，和这三年解放战争中，农民起了很大作用。我们送儿子、送丈夫参军。我自己就是一个例子。我只有一个儿子，参了军，给蒋二秃子反动派杀害了。我一滴眼泪也没有掉，我的儿子为人民服务而牺牲，是光荣的，大家同志们都在给他报仇。为了支援战争，我们农民自己吃菜汤，吃糊糊，把粮食送给前线，今天开这样的大会也是不容易的，是人民大众的血汗换来的。
    在共产党毛主席领导之下，我们反了恶霸，减了租，现在又分了土地，还有了政治权利。
    过去我们妇女，受压迫剥削，更没地位，蒋二秃子反动派，还强奸妇女。现在我们妇女也翻身了，也有地位了。这都是共产党毛主席领导的。永远跟着毛主席走，一点也不会错。
    我回去以后，要动员农民妇女，努力生产，支援前线，彻底打倒蒋介石，解放全中国。美国帝国主义帮助他，可是美国帝国主义自己也是一只纸老虎，我们不怕他！
    宗教界民主人士首席代表
    吴耀宗　发言
    我们宗教单位的八个代表，包括了佛教、回教和基督教的代表，愿以最愉快最兴奋的心情，对“中国人民政治协商会议组织法”，“中华人民共和国中央人民政府组织法”和“中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领”这三个重要文件，表示我们完全的同意，和绝对的拥护。
    我们所以同意和拥护这三个文件，是因为它们都是根据新民主主义的原则协商拟定的，而新民主主义，又是今日中国所必须遵循的唯一道路。
    共同纲领指出解放后的中国的新政权是“人民民主专政”，是以工农联盟为基础，以工人阶级为领导的统一战线的政权。这个统一战线包括了反动分子除外的工人阶级，农民阶级，小资产阶级，民族资产阶级及其他爱国民主分子，也包括了少数民族和各种宗教信仰的人民。这个统一战线所要求的，不是一个超现实的纲领，而是一个切合实际的纲领；它统一了全国人民的意志，使他们在共同的目标上，共同前进。
    这个统一战线将要使过去被人讥为“一盘散沙”的中国，形成一个空前伟大的团结。过去中国人民之所以不能团结，不是因为他们没有斗争的意志，而只是因为他们没有正确的领导，只是因为统治者对他们采用“分而治之”的恶毒办法。现在，我们看清楚我们共同的敌人了，那就是帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义；我们也看清我们的共同的目标了，那就是一个独立、民主、和平、统一、富强的中华人民共和国。因为我们发现了共同的目标，认识了共同的敌人，我们就能团结起来，组成统一战线，在中国共产党领导之下，发挥我们所固有的、巨大无比的力量。
    统一战线也将使中国实现真正的民主，它使在它里面的每一个人民，都能在共同目标之下，参预国家的大计，表达自己的意见，提出自己的主张。共同纲领所采取的民主集中制，将保证这个民主原则的充分实现，因为它要人民政府向人民代表负责，人民代表向人民负责。
    我们宗教信徒能够参加这次新中国建设的伟业，是一件荣幸的事，也是一件愉快的事。我们所以感到荣幸，感到愉快，就是因为在新中国建设的计划中，宗教占有了它所应当占有的地位。在共同纲领里面，宗教信仰自由的原则是确定了的。我们宝贵这个自由，我们也决不辜负这个自由，或滥用这个自由。我们也要用尽我们的力量，把宗教里面腐恶的传统和它过去与封建力量，帝国主义的联系，根本铲除。我们不但要在宗教里面做消毒的工夫，也要把宗教的积极作用，发挥光大。追求真理，服务人类，是一切高级宗教的共同目标。把这目标应用到今日的中国，和今日的世界，就是要扫除封建的残余力量，打倒帝国主义的侵略和挑拨战争的阴谋，同时拥护世界的永久和平，拥护民主建设的力量。我们愿意追随着全国的民主党派和民主人士，为这个共同目标的实现而奋斗。
　　华南人民解放军代表
    吴奇伟　发言
    主席、各位代表先生：
    今天我能够在这儿参加代表全中国各革命阶级，各民主党派，各人民团体，各民族及海外华侨民主人士的政协会议，亲身和各代表在一起讨论筹委会提出的三个文件——人民政协组织法，中华人民共和国中央人民政府组织法，及中国人民政协共同纲领，我感到无限的光荣和兴奋。因为我认为三个文件草案的协商，充分地表现了新的民主精神，反映了全国人民的要求，我相信每一个中国人都会感到满意，都会全心全意地来拥护的。
    我现在站在这个伟大庄严的盛典中来讲话，我又是感到异常的惭愧。我是一个军人，又是一个国民党党员，曾经立志要为实现孙中山先生的革命的三民主义而努力，北伐以后，国民党为蒋介石所篡窃，孙先生的三大政策为蒋介石所背叛，我也就为蒋介石等无耻的革命叛徒所蒙蔽，愚弄，尤其在抗战以前的几个年月中，我更充当了反革命反人民的工具，阻碍了革命的进展。但抗战结束以后，当蒋介石又发动了内战时，我开始发觉到这种内战是违反人民要求，残害人民的罪恶行为，我内心已不愿意再积极为他们驱使去作内战的工具。但是那时候我还是彷徨苦闷，还没有决心离开他们。到后来在内战中看到了反动政府的残暴的措施，激起了全国人民的愤怒，而在另一方面，看到了中共所领导的人民解放军实际上执行着爱国爱民的政策，到处得到了人民的拥护，这事实才启发了我，教育了我。教我认清了反动派的狰狞面孔，教我认识了中共领导的革命路线才是真正的实行孙先生革命主张的路线。认清了只有走向毛主席的旗帜下前进，才能求得国家的独立、富强，人民的自由、幸福，所以我才决然地走到人民阵营里来。
    今天蒋介石匪帮，更加卑鄙无耻，甚至勾结民族死敌——日本法西斯军人，来屠杀人民，我相信这些无耻的措施，只有加速地使反动阵营里的爱国军人的澈底觉悟，转向人民的队伍来。谨祝：
    人民政协成功万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
    朱总司令万岁！
    特别邀请代表
    钱昌照　发言
    主席，各位代表：
    本席过去十八年参加重工业建设工作，内心总是苦闷的，因为国民党政府自始至终代表极少数人的利益，至于大众的利益，根本没有顾到，因此经济建设，特别是重工业建设，也就无从谈起。
    今天的情形完全不同了。人民政治协商会议已经开幕；中央人民政府即将成立；共同纲领又复明白规定工业应以恢复和发展重工业为重点。在共产党领导之下，在人民领袖毛主席领导之下，经济建设最近将来一定会有长足的进展。所以凡是从事经济建设的人，尤其是从事重工业建设的人一个个手舞足蹈。
    中国重工业建设的困难当然是有的，只要我们有决心，有计划，有步骤地去做，任何困难，都应在我们面前消灭。
    本席今天有几点肤浅的意见，提出来供各位代表的参考。第一点，过去国民党政府对资源调查太不注意，资源调查的经费，微乎其微，因此我们对人口，土地，矿藏，森林，水力等等根本不大清楚。在这种情形之下，全国性经济建设计划是无法完成的，所以我们应该从速举办大规模的资源调查。第二点，最近两三年内，大规模的重工业新建设几乎是不可能的，把已有的重工业加以整理，加以配合，加以补充，实为当务之急。第三点，重工业建设应由中央统筹，统筹之后，有一部分工作可以责成地方去做，要是先由各地方分头建设起来，将来再加调整，是极不经济的。第四点，计划全国性的经济建设，其工作非常繁重。空洞的计划，草率的计划，有很大的危险性。我们看苏联几个五年计划，每个计划起稿的经过，何等认真，何等彻底！我们应该向苏联学习，苏联也一定很乐意的指教我们的。第五点，工业建设的推动，全靠人才，所以职工的训练，刻不容缓。别的可以省钱，训练人才，千万不可省钱。此外各工业与学校及研究机关之间亦应密切联络，充分配合，使理论与实际一致。第六点，世界技术标准，蒸蒸日上，我们非不得已千万不可暗中摸索。我们必须迎头赶上。最新的技术，应该用种种方法去取得。这可使中国加速工业化，这可使经济建设不走冤枉路。第七点，在大规模的工业建设中，管理比技术更难。管理的对象是人，技术的对象是物。我们要想工业化，必须着重管理。工业建设如不把各种管理制度建立起来，或是有了制度，没有适当的人去执行，那是一定会失败的。如何使各种工业本身企业化，如何使各种工业不再有浪费的情形，如何使各种工业不再有脱离人民群众的官僚主义作风，是今日中国工业建设中最迫切的问题。第八点，经济建设职工的情绪，与一般工作效率，有决定性的关系。大家应该搞通思想，遵守纪律，着重管理，提高技术，互助，互信，这样才能作到新旧不分，职工一体。
    本席以前在资源委员会工作。资源委员会是建设重工业的国营事业机关，过去十八年，很惭愧的没有什么成绩，但有许多许多的职工，一向抱定宗旨，不做事情则已，要做事情只替国家做事情。此次二十余万职工比较完整的投入新民主主义国家的怀抱，其愉快难以言语形容。我们一定全心全意为人民服务，决不辜负国家，决不辜负共产党的领导，决不辜负人民领袖毛主席的领导。
    特别邀请代表
    周信芳　发言
    各位代表先生：
    信芳想就戏剧与政治的问题做一些补充。
    中国的旧戏、地方戏，原来都是从民间来的。许多戏可以看出中国人民苦闷的象征和天才的创造，因而为广大人民所喜闻乐见。这种力量也就被那些封建统治者看上了，每每被他们歪曲利用，来巩固他们的统治。
    但这些封建统治者虽然也利用戏剧这一个有力的文化工具，却又从来看不起干戏剧的。所谓“倡优隶卒”是联在一道的。从满清皇朝，北洋军阀，到蒋介石的封建法西斯的统治一贯的压迫戏剧工作者，尤其是想通过戏剧替人民说话的。所以以前的戏剧是归治安机关管理。一者把戏剧专当作娱乐工具看，而不当作教育工具看，倘使你的戏里面含有强烈的民族意识，民主思想，治安机关便会很敏感的给你取缔，演员常常会坐牢或是杀头。我们没有忘记日本投降后蒋介石发动反革命内战的时候所举行的艺员登记。他的目的一面是糟蹋我们，一面是箝制我们的思想。你要革命便取消你的登记证，断绝你的生路。
    直到人民大革命发展到江南，我们才被解放。上次文代大会上周副主席的报告着重指出在新民主主义文化建设中改革旧剧的必要。又说旧社会欢喜戏剧，却看不起戏剧，今天我们不仅欢喜戏剧而且尊重戏剧。所以要改造戏剧。这次人民政治协商会议召开，共同纲领里面把发展戏剧电影作为文化教育政策的重要组成部分，我们几个旧剧工作者也被邀请来参加这一个旷古未有的开国盛典，这不单是对我们几个演员的鼓励，对于近百万的我们全体艺人也是绝大的鼓励。
    原来我们中国旧戏也不是完全与政治无关的。从优孟以来许多优秀演员曾经通过很委婉曲折，或是尖刻猛烈的讽刺来批评政治，影响政治。但顶多也只能讽刺政治，却不能参与政治。旧剧演员有机会参与政治甚至参加今天这样伟大的人民建国事业的，在中国五千年的历史上要从我们这四个人——梅兰芳、程砚秋、袁雪芬和我算起！旧剧也当作人民艺术看待，这真是我们从来不曾有过的光荣。当然我们知道这光荣不是容易得来的，这得感谢近百年来中国人民以及志士仁人为中国革命流的血，得感谢中国共产党二十八年来的坚贞奋斗，得感谢人民解放军的英勇善战和伟大牺牲，更得感谢伟大人民领袖毛主席的英明领导。
    我们也知道这种旷代的光荣是不能白受的。我们在这个机会，敢向毛主席，各位代表，和全国人民保证：
    一、我们一定要唤起戏剧界全体工作者拥护人民政治协商会议的伟大建国工作，并学习共同纲领等几个基本大法。提高大家对自己的国家和政府的热爱与认识。
    二、我们一定要加强团结，加强学习，克服以前那样的散漫，自私，人自为战，用集体力量改革旧剧，实现共同纲领给我们规定的任务：“为人民服务，启示人民的政治觉悟，鼓励人民的劳动热情”。
    三、我们一定要打破以前的故步自封，以及许多职业的偏见，勇敢大胆地向人民学习，向兄弟艺术学习，向文化遗产学习，向先进国家的优良艺术成就学习，创造有思想性与艺术性的新戏剧，以配合中华人民共和国开国的规模。
    人民政治协商会议成功万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    伟大人民领袖毛主席万岁！
