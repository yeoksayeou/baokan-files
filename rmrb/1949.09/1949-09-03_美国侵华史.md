　　A History of American Aggression Against China
　　Liu Danian
　　I. Aggression Against China by Following or Through Other Countries (Continued from Part 7)
　　Like Japan, the United States also highly regarded Li Hongzhang, the most capable traitor in the Qing government's traitorous clique (during the Sino-Japanese War peace negotiations, Japan refused Zhang Yinheng and Shao Youlian but welcomed Li Hongzhang), wanting to specially elevate Li Hongzhang's position in the Qing government to benefit from him. First, the State Council telegraphed Chafee, instructing him to assist Li Hongzhang in "suppressing riots" within his "jurisdiction" (!?). Then, in the name of the American official newspaper, they sent a telegram directly to Li Hongzhang, asking:
　　"The sentiment here is that foreign troops should withdraw from China, and recognize your Excellency (Li's official title) as the government's peace negotiation minister. Can your Excellency reorganize peace, protect foreigners, and suppress the 'Boxer bandits'?"
　　Although Li Hongzhang agreed, he had already been bought by Tsarist Russia (Li had received a "gift" of 500,000 rubles from Tsarist Russia when Russia leased Lushun and Dalian in 1898; the Qing government called this "Li Hongzhang's collusion with Russia"). Tsarist Russia intended to exploit Li Hongzhang's special role, using him to sign a secret treaty with the Qing government to obtain all the benefits in Northeast China. The United States not only found this embarrassing but also saw its plan to continue invading the Northeast after entering Korea through Japan completely thwarted. It then turned against him, on one hand, through Britain, urging Liu Kunyi, the Governor-General of Liangjiang and Minister of the Southern Seas, and Zhang Zhidong, the Governor of Hubei, to oppose Li Hongzhang's signing of the Russian treaty, saying Li Hongzhang's actions would "lead China to partition"; on the other hand, it exerted diplomatic pressure. In February 1901, the U.S. State Department sent a note to the Qing envoy to the U.S., Wu Tingfang, stating, "The U.S. agrees with Japan's advice to China regarding the Three Eastern Provinces issue." It also delivered a memorandum directly threatening Li Hongzhang, saying that if he signed a secret treaty with another country, ceded land, or borrowed money, it "may cause great harm and lead to a crisis." Li Hongzhang wanted Wu Tingfang to secretly promise the United States trade, mining, and railway benefits, asking it to "maintain" him on the Russian issue. The United States insisted on not making concessions on Northeast China, and as a result, the Russian treaty was halted, and the United States' policy was largely successful. With the signing of the Boxer Protocol, the United States, like other countries, obtained the right to station troops from Beijing to the coast and received over 32.9 million taels in indemnity.
　　In 1904, the United States independently established an "Exclusion Act" amendment, overturning the content of the 1868 Burlingame Treaty, in which the United States requested the Qing government to allow Chinese people to travel to the United States "at their own discretion, without prohibition," and the 1894 "Sino-American Convention on Limiting Chinese Laborers Entering the United States and Protecting Chinese Residents in the United States." This made the anti-Chinese atrocities that the United States had inflicted on Chinese people in America for more than 20 years, such as insults, abuse, beatings, expulsions, and massacres, completely legal. The "Immigration Law" that the United States exercised for a long time afterward was established on this basis.
　　II. Gradually Moving Towards Independent Aggression Against China
　　(1905-1907, from the Russo-Japanese War to World War I)
　　At the beginning of the 20th century, world capitalism had become imperialism. The famous American oil trust (i.e., Standard Oil) was established in 1900. The American steel trust produced 9 million tons of steel in 1902 (Guangxu 28th year). This development of American capitalism elevated its position in the world and strengthened the independence of its foreign imperialist aggression policy. Taking the end of the Russo-Japanese War as an opportunity, the United States changed from a history of aggression against China through other countries to a history of gradually independent aggression against China.
　　Originally, the United States' use of Japan to intervene in Korea was not its main purpose (such as its transfer of the railway it operated in Korea to Japan). It only wanted to realize its invasion of Manchuria through this step. Therefore, eliminating Russia's influence in Northeast China had become the United States' established policy. This point was already demonstrated in the Eight-Nation Alliance, and in February 1904, when the war between Japan and Russia broke out to seize the Three Eastern Provinces, the United States wanted to continue using Japan to achieve the goal of expelling Russia and acquiring Manchuria. During the Russo-Japanese War, Japan's finances were extremely difficult, and the United States supplied Japan with war expenses of 450 million U.S. dollars, almost entirely dependent on the United States. At that time, France and Russia had an alliance, and Germany was also close to Russia. France and Germany might intervene in Japan, so the newly-appointed Theodore Roosevelt came out to warn France and Germany: if one of them helped Russia, the United States would help Japan. When Japan gained significant victories in the war, but its strength was exhausted, and Russia was remobilizing, Roosevelt came out again to "mediate" in Japan's favor, inviting representatives of Japan and Russia to meet in Portsmouth, USA, in August 1905 (Guangxu 31st year) to negotiate a peace treaty. All of these were means for the United States to attack China, namely, helping Japan defeat Russia and then, at the very least, sharing the interests of Northeast China equally with Japan.
　　During the war, the United States provided Japan with such great assistance, naturally giving the U.S.-Japan side considerable confidence in victory. The United States and Japan also negotiated a secret agreement, with Japan recognizing the U.S. annexation of the Philippines, and the U.S. recognizing Japan's annexation of Korea in exchange. The agreement was concluded before the Russo-Japanese armistice in 1905. This was an especially undeniable criminal conspiracy in the United States' aggression against China. The demise of Korea was determined at this time, not waiting for the formality of the Japan-Korea Annexation Treaty on August 22, 1910 (Xuantong 2nd year, July 18th); American aggressors had to keep this agreement secret for a long time, and it was only made public for the first time from his private records after Roosevelt's death.
　　On September 5, 1905, the Treaty of Portsmouth was signed, and U.S.-Japan relations rapidly changed from then on. At the end of August of the same year, the American capitalist and railroad tycoon E. H. Harriman went to Japan under the guise of travel to discuss plans for the U.S. and Japan to divide the spoils in Manchuria after defeating Russia. Japanese Prime Minister Katsura Taro met with Harriman and negotiated an initial contract, stipulating:
　　"During Sino-Japanese or Russo-Japanese war, the railway shall at any time be subject to the order of the Japanese government for the transportation of troops and military supplies. The Japanese government shall reward the railway for its services and protect the railway from invasion by other countries at any time."
　　The day this contract took effect would be the day the United States achieved its goal of seizing Northeast China. But things did not go so smoothly. When the Japanese government reconsidered that if the United States acquired the South Manchurian Railway, Japan's position of using Manchuria as a base to attack the Chinese mainland would be replaced by the United States, it immediately overturned the previous agreement. Harriman returned to San Francisco, satisfied, and received a letter from the Japanese consul upon landing, stating that "the Japanese government has found it necessary to conduct more careful investigation and research on the draft contract of October 12, 1905," asking him to "regard the contract as an unresolved matter." Later, Soichi Toyoda (President of the Industrial Bank of Japan), the intermediary on the Japanese side when the contract was signed, telegraphed Harriman that the previous contract was simply voided. The United States used all its efforts but completely failed, greatly disliking Japan. The "U.S.-Japan estrangement" of the next few decades began from this point.
　　After rejecting American capital, the Japanese side turned to Britain, using the method of "raising corporate bonds," attracting 140 million yuan in British capital to operate the South Manchurian Railway Company, the base for Japan's invasion of China, achieving the later "Manchurian Railway Kingdom" and a smooth series of invasions of China. The United States, on one hand, retaliated against Japan by excluding Japanese immigrants and prohibiting Japanese children from attending schools in Europe and America. The State Department sought reasons to warn the Japanese government that Japan's actions in Manchuria would leave no room for other countries to trade, "hoping that the Japanese government would reflect on Russia's failure to monopolize practical interests in the area." On the other hand, it courted China. Harriman planned to build a new line outside the South Manchurian Railway to compete with Japan. At this time, the American Straight (Willard. Straight) was the American Consul-General in Fengtian (formerly a Reuters correspondent in Korea, promoted to this position for his meritorious service in invading China), greatly appreciated by Harriman. Before Straight went to Fengtian, he was informed of the above plan. After Straight took office, he joined forces with American consuls stationed in various parts of the Three Eastern Provinces to carry out extensive activities. Coincidentally, the following year - 1907 (Guangxu 33rd year), the Qing government appointed Tang Shaoyi, a graduate of Yale University in the United States, as the Governor of Fengtian. Straight then proposed his plan to Tang Shaoyi: to build a branch line from the Jingfeng Railway, from Xinmintun to Fakumen, preparing to develop to Qiqihar and Aigun, and then to Siberia; and suggested that American capital, mainly Harriman's, of 20 million U.S. dollars, establish a Three Eastern Provinces Bank as the economic center of the Three Eastern Provinces. In addition to building railways, the bank would manage industries and reform the currency system. On August 7, 1907, Straight and Tang Shaoyi formed a memorandum, and the so-called Xinfa Railway issue emerged. But it immediately encountered serious protests from Japan, stating that "the Imperial Government would never recognize it." Coincidentally, the famous American financial crisis broke out, causing Harriman to be overwhelmed, and the matter was "postponed for consideration." As a result, the Xinfa Railway contract fell into the pockets of British and French capitalists. This was the second failure of the United States to seize the Three Eastern Provinces.

　　美国侵华史
    刘大年
  　一　追随或通过别国向中国侵略　（续七）
    美国也和日本一样，于清政府卖国集团中所最看得上的卖国能手，是大地主大买办兼军阀的李鸿章（中日战争议和时，日本曾拒绝张荫桓邵友濂而欢迎李鸿章），想把李鸿章在清政府中的地位特别提高，来从他身上取彩，先由国务院电告查飞，要他于“职权范围内”（！？）帮助李鸿章“削平暴乱”。接着又以美国官方报纸名义，直接给李鸿章一个电报，问他说：
    “此间意思，均欲洋兵退出中国，并认中堂（李官位称呼）为政府议和大臣，中堂能重整太平，保护洋人，剿办‘团匪’否？”
    李鸿章虽然给以同意答复，无如他已被沙俄收买在先（一九九八年俄租旅顺大连时李已收受沙俄五十万卢布的“礼物”，清政府把这叫做“李鸿章向与俄习”），沙俄正欲乘此发挥李鸿章的特殊作用，经过他与清政府订一个密约，取得全部东北利益。美国于此不仅面子很难堪，而且使它通过日本插足朝鲜后继续侵入东北的计划，完全不能实现，遂又翻过脸来，一面通过英国在中国运动两江总督兼南洋大臣刘坤一，及湖北总督张之洞出面反对李鸿章签订俄约，说李鸿章的作法是要把中国“驯至瓜分而后已”；一面又从外交上施以压力。一九○一年二月，美国务院送一个照会给清驻美公使伍廷芳，表示“此次东三省一事，日本劝告中国各节，美国主亦以为然”，又另交一个节略直接威胁李鸿章，说如果与别国订密约，或让地，或借款，“恐有大碍，蹈危机”。李鸿章曾要伍廷芳秘密许给美国通商，矿路利益，请它在沙俄问题上予以“维持”，美国坚持对东北不肯让步，结果俄约停划，美国政策大致成功。辛丑和约的签订，美国与其他各国同样取得由北京到海岸的驻兵权，又分得赔款三千二百九十余万两。
    至一九○四年，美国又单独成立一个“排华律”修正案，把一八六八年蒲安臣条约中，美国要求清廷允许中国人民往来美国“听其自便，不得禁阻”的内容以及一八九四年“中美会订限禁来美华工保护寓美华人条款”，全部推翻，使二十余年来，美国加于旅美中国人民的侮辱、虐待、欧打、驱逐、屠杀……等排华暴行，变成了完全合法，而后来美国长期行使的“移民律”，也就在这个基础上成立起来。
    二　逐渐走向独立侵略中国
    （一九○五—一九第七即从日俄战争到第一次世界大战）
    二十世纪初期，世界资本主义已经变成了帝国主义。美国著名的煤油托辣斯（即美孚油公司）是一九○○年成立的。美国钢业托辣斯在一九○二年（光绪二十八年）时产生了九百万吨的钢。美国这种资本主义发展使它在世界的地位提高，增强了对外帝国主义侵略政策的独立性，以日俄战争结束为契机，美国由通过别国向中国侵略的历史，变成逐渐独立侵略中国的历史。
    原来美国利用日本向朝鲜插足，并不是它的主要目的（如它把在朝鲜经营的铁路让与日本），它只是想经过此步骤来实现侵入满洲。因此，排除俄国在东北的势力，已成美国既定政策，八国联军中既已表现此点，及一九○四年二月，日俄两国争夺东三省的强盗战争爆发，美国遂想继续利用日本，达到驱逐俄国取得满洲的目的。日俄战争中，日本财政异常困难，美国先后供给日本战费达四万万五千万美金之多，日本财政几全部仰给于美国。当时法俄有同盟关系，德国也与俄国接近，法德有干涉日本可能，美国则由刚上台不久的老罗斯福（Ｔｈｅｏｄｏｒｅ　Ｒｏｏｓｅｖｅｌｔ）出来警告法德：如果它们有一个出来帮助俄国，美就要出来帮助日本。及战事在日本方面获得重大胜利，但其力量已经衰竭，而俄国则正重新动员的时候，罗斯福又出来作对日本有利的“调停”，并邀请日俄两国代表于一九○五年（光绪三十一年）八月会于美国的朴茨茅斯商订和约。凡此种种，都是美国进攻中国的一种手段，即帮助日本打败俄国后，从而与日本最少平分东北利益。
    战争期间，美国对日本既如此大力帮助，自使日美方面胜利得有相当把握，美国与日本于此又谈判一个秘密协定，由日本承认美国吞并菲律滨，美国则以承认日本吞并朝鲜为交换条件。协定在一九○五年日俄停战前成立，这是美国侵略中国过程中尤为无可狡饰的罪恶勾当，朝鲜灭亡，此时已被规定，不等待一九一○年八月二十二日（宣统二年七月十八日）日韩合邦条约的形式才实行；美国侵略者不得不把这个协定保持了很长时间的秘密，只有在罗斯福死去以后，才第一次从他的私人记载中公开出来。
    一九○五年九月五日朴茨茅斯和约签订，美日关系亦从此迅速变化。是年八月底美国大资本家铁路大王哈利满（Ｅ．Ｈ．Ｈａｒｒｉｍａｎ）以游历为名赴日本，讨论美日在击败俄国后对满洲分赃的计划，日本首相桂太郎出面与哈利满商谈，由美国组织一个银团，收买日本从俄国手中夺得的中国南满铁路，并于十月间成立一草合同，规定有：
    “中日或日俄交战时，该铁路随时受日本政府之命令，运输军队及军用品，日政府对该路之服务应予报赏，并随时保护该铁路不受他国侵略。”
    这个合同生效之日，即美国夺取东北目的实现之时。但事情并不如此顺利，当日本政府重新考虑到如果让美国取得南满路，则今后日本以满洲为基地，向中国内地进攻的地位将会被美国所代替时，马上推翻前约，哈利满心满意足回抵旧金山一上岸，就接到日本领事一个公函，说“日本政府于一九○五年十月十二日之草合同发现有更加慎重调查与研究之必要”，要他“认该合同为未决事件”，其后更由订合同时，日本方面的中间人添田寿一（日本兴业银行总裁）电告哈利满前约干脆作废。美国用尽心机，至此完全失败，对日本大起反感，以后数十年的“日美交恶”就从此始。
    日本方面于拒绝美国资本后，转向英国用“募集社债”方式，先后吸引英资一万万四千万元，经营日本侵略中国大本营——南满洲铁路株式会社，成就以后的“满铁王国”与一帆风顺的全部侵华事业；美国则一面对日本施以报复，排斥日本移民，不准日本赴欧美儿童入学的学校读书，并由国务院寻找理由警告日本政府，说日本在满洲的行动，其他外国将没有通商余地，“深望日本政府鉴于俄国在该地欲为实利的独占而失败，切加反省”。一面又向中国方面活动，哈利满打算于南满路外别筑一新线，以与日本对抗。这时美国人司戴德（Ｗｉｌｌａｒｄ．Ｓｔｒａｉｇｈｔ）为美驻奉天总领事（原为路透社驻朝鲜访员，以侵华活动有功累升至此），大为哈利满所赏识，于司戴德赴奉天之前告以上述计划，司抵任后即联合驻东三省各地美国领事大肆活动，恰好第二年——一九○七年（光绪三十三年），清政府以美国耶鲁大学毕业生唐绍仪为奉天巡抚。司戴德即向唐绍仪提出他的计划，于京奉路筑一支线，自新民屯至法库门，准备发展至齐齐哈尔与爱珲，进而至西伯利亚；并建议以哈利满为主的美国资本二千万美金，设立一东三省银行，为东三省的经济中心，除筑路以外兴办实业，改革币制……等，都归这个银行经理。一九○七年八月七日司戴德与唐绍仪成立备忘录一件，从此即出现所谓新法铁路问题。但立即遭到日本严重抗议，表示“帝国政府断难承认”，又巧遇有名的美国金融大风潮爆发，致哈利满一时力不从心，把这件事“展期考虑”，结果新法铁路合同落到英法资本家荷包里去了。这是美国夺取东三省的第二次失败。
