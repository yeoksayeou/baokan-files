　　The Spirit of Ownership
  　Fengtai Transport Workers Rush to Ship Wheat Seeds
    Changchun
    On the afternoon of the 14th, it was raining, and 58,000 jin of wheat seeds from the Cooperative General Agency arrived at the station. If they were not immediately transported into the warehouse, they would be damaged.
    Director Li of the Cooperative Office discussed with the group leader of the transport team what to do. The workers unanimously agreed that this was a matter for the public, which meant it was their own business. Therefore, they immediately mobilized all workers to actively transport the seeds and called on everyone to ensure that not a single grain was lost. The workers responded enthusiastically to this call. Stepping through the muddy water on the street, they slipped and slid as they rushed to transport the seeds to the warehouse about half a mile away from the station. In less than three hours, twenty-seven people successfully transported all the wheat seeds. During the rush, if a sack was broken, it was immediately sewn up. If anyone saw wheat scattered on the cart, they would shout, "Comrades! Sweep it up, don't waste it!" They sang songs, helping and encouraging each other. If a worker slipped and fell, another worker would immediately carry him. If a wheel got stuck in a mud pit, everyone would work together to get it out. Wang Fengzi, who was over forty years old, kept shouting "Let's do a great job!" Without using his hands, he skillfully used his shoulder to place a bag of wheat in a very suitable position. This earned him applause from everyone. In this tense and mutually supportive atmosphere, they successfully completed the task.
    Director Li took out a few packs of cigarettes to thank them, but they were unwilling to accept them, saying, "It's a public matter, we should put in some effort, it's nothing!"
    This truly demonstrates the spirit of ownership of the new China.

　　主人翁的气概
  　丰台排运车工人抢运麦种
    长春
    十四日下午，天下着雨，合作总社的五万八千斤麦种运到了车站，如果不马上起运入库，就要受损失。
    合作社办事处李主任和排运车的组长商量怎样办，工友们一致认为这是公家的事，也就是自己的事。于是立刻动员全体工友积极起运，并号召大家保证不受一点损失。工友们热烈地响应了这一号召。踏着满街的泥水，一步一滑地向离车站约半里远的仓库抢运，二十七个人不到三个钟头，全部麦种即顺利运完。在抢运中，麻袋破了，马上叫缝上；谁看见撒在车上的麦子，便喊：“同志！扫扫，别糟蹋了！”他们唱着歌，互相帮助、互相鼓舞；一个工友被滑倒了，另一工友马上替他扛起来，车轮陷在泥坑里了，便大家伙一齐上；四十多岁的王疯子还不断的“来个漂亮的；”不用手扶着，肩膀一使劲，很敏捷地就把一包麦子放在很适当的位置。博得大家的喝采。就在这紧张互助的情绪下，胜利地完成了任务。
    李主任拿出几盒烟卷来慰劳他们，他们还不愿接受说：“公家的事，应该卖点力气，不算啥！”
    这真表现了新中国主人翁的气概。
