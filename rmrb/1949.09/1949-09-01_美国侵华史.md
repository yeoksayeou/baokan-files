A History of American Aggression Against China
    Liu Danian
  　I. Aggression Against China by Following or Through Other Countries (Continued from IV)
    During the Treaty of Shimonoseki negotiations, the United States, through Li Hongzhang's advisor, the American Foster, supported Japan in threatening China in various ways, stipulating that in addition to "China recognizing the complete and absolute independence of Korea," China would permanently cede the Penghu Islands, Taiwan, and the Liaodong Peninsula to Japan.

    On the sixth day after the signing of the Treaty of Shimonoseki—April 23, 1895—the intervention of Russia, France, and Germany suddenly erupted, putting Japan in a very awkward position. On the one hand, it decided to make full concessions to the three countries even if it ultimately couldn't avoid it, while adopting a policy of not yielding an inch to China. On the other hand, it requested the United States, Britain, Italy, and other countries to come forward to counter the intervention. The United States deeply feared that the actions of Russia, France, and Germany would cause China to renege, refuse to ratify the Treaty of Shimonoseki, or even use the military assistance of the three countries to organize a counterattack against Japan, in which case both Japan and the United States would have lost all their previous efforts. Therefore, when Britain and Italy refused Japan's request, the United States alone continued to put pressure on the Qing government, carrying out counter-intervention activities. The Japanese Minister to the United States, Kurino, after contacting the US government in accordance with instructions from the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, telegraphed Mutsu Munemitsu:

    "The Secretary of State of the United States has promised to cooperate with Japan to the extent that it does not contradict the principle of remaining neutral (?) and has instructed the American Minister in Beijing to advise the Chinese government to accelerate the implementation of the ratification of the peace terms."

    At the beginning of the Tripartite Intervention, Japan was still bargaining. After Russia, France, and Germany prepared to use force as diplomatic leverage, they organized a large-scale joint fleet in the Far East. Russia secretly deployed troops to the Chinese border. After the US government obtained this information through its espionage activities in Russia, it immediately informed Kurino in secret. Kurino urgently telegraphed the Japanese government, enabling Japan to quickly make full concessions and avoid a war of resistance. The Tripartite Intervention ended according to the wishes of the United States and Japan, and the Treaty of Shimonoseki was affirmed. China's process of moving towards a colony took a bigger step forward from then on.

    In the same year, Britain, France, and the United States, taking advantage of the Chengdu and Gutian missionary cases, launched negotiations with the Qing government. In addition to the three countries' warships sailing up the Yangtze River to demonstrate force, demanding compensation, and dismissing and punishing more than a dozen Chinese officials of various ranks, the American Minister to China, Denby, further forced the Qing court to accept a "Draft Prevention of Anti-Foreignism," obtaining full rights to preach, reside, and purchase land.

    Soon after, Germany took the lead in demanding compensation from the Qing government in November 1897, forcibly occupying Jiaozhou Bay. Then Russia occupied Lushun and Dalian, France leased Guangzhou Bay, Britain took the opportunity to seize Weihaiwei, Japan designated Fujian as its own, and Italy also wanted to lease Sanmen Bay. The coastal areas were completely turned into the "spheres of influence" of the powers. At this time, the United States (1898) was engaged in a war with Spain for the Philippines and had no time to spare for China. After the war ended, it found that China had actually been completely divided by the powers, which caused great disappointment. US President William McKinley stated in his message to Congress: "The coastline of China has fallen into the hands of foreigners, and the United States cannot stand idly by in the face of this important change... If we do not want to be squeezed out by the powers occupying Chinese territory, we must participate in Chinese affairs," fully expressing this sense of disappointment and the intention to remedy the situation urgently. However, the United States had no possibility of obtaining a sphere of influence in China at this time, so it adopted the suggestion of the Englishman Hippisley and, through Secretary of State John Hay, put forward the famous "Open Door" policy in September 1899, the main points of which were:

    (1) All countries shall not interfere with each other in any "sphere of influence" or leased territory in China, in any treaty port or investment enterprise.

    (2) China's existing tariff rates shall apply to all goods loaded and unloaded at ports within all "spheres of influence," regardless of which country they belong to.

    (3) In any port within such a "sphere of influence," no higher dockage fees shall be charged to the ships of other countries than to those of its own country, and all freight rates charged by railways laid, managed, or operated within such a "sphere of influence" for the transport of goods belonging to other countries shall not be higher than those charged to its own country.

　　美国侵华史
    刘大年
  　一　追随或通过别国向中国侵略　（续四）
    马关谈判中，美国经过中国议和代表李鸿章的顾问美国人福世德，支持日本对中国多方威胁，除“中国认明朝鲜国确为完全无缺之独立国”外，将中国澎湖群岛、台湾、与辽东半岛永远割让给日本。
    马关条约签字后的第六日，——一八九五年四月二十三日，俄法德三国干涉突然发作，日本顿时很狼狈，一面决定对三国纵令最后不能不完全让步，而对中国则采取一步不让的方针，一面请求美、英、意等国出来作反干涉。美国深怕因俄法德的行动引起中国方面翻悔，不批准马关条约，甚至利用三国军事外援组织对日反攻，则日本和美国都前功尽弃。所以英、意对日本请求加以拒绝时，美国仍单独对清政府施以压力，进行反干涉活动，日驻美公使栗野奉日外务省训令与美政府接洽后复陆奥宗光电云：
    “美国务卿承诺在不与局外中立（？）之主旨相矛盾范围内，与日本协力，而对批准讲和条件之事，已训令在北京美国公使劝告中国政府加速实行云。”
    三国干涉初起，日本还在讨价还价，俄法德准备以武力作外交后盾，组织了一个大规模的东洋联合舰队，俄国更秘密往中国边境调兵，美政府经它在俄国的特务工作得到此种情报后，立即密告栗野，栗野急电告日政府，使日本迅速完全让步，避免了它虽于对抗的战争。三国干涉，依照美日的愿望结束，马关条约被肯定下来。中国走向殖民地的过程，从此更大踏步前进。
    就在这一年，英、法、美借口成都、古田两起教案，向清政府大开交涉，除三国军舰开至长江以内示威，要求赔款，及撤惩中国大小官吏十余人外，驻华美使田贝更强迫清廷接受一个“防止排外草案”，取得传教、居住、购买土地等充分权利。
    此后不久德国首先于一八九七年十一月向清政府索取报酬，武力占领胶州湾，于是俄占旅顺、大连，法租广州湾，英国乘机索得威海卫，日本又划福建为己有，意大利也要租借三门湾，滨海地区完全成列强的“势力范围”。而美国则正在这时（一八九八年）从事与西班牙争夺菲律滨的战争，对中国无暇兼顾，战争终了，发现中国实际上已被列强分割净尽，感到很大失望，美总统麦金莱（Ｗｉｌｌｉａｍ　Ｍｃｋｉｎｌｅｙ）对国会提出的意见书有云：“中国沿海土地有落入外人手中者，此种重要变局吾美不能袖手旁观……苟欲不受占有中国土地之强国的排挤，非参预华事不可”，充分表现了这种失望情绪和急谋补救的企图。但美国此时已没有再从中国取得势力范围的可能，乃采用英人希贝斯莱的建议，由国务卿海约翰（Ｊｏｈｎ　Ｈａｙ）于一八九九年（光绪二十五年）九月提出有名的所谓“门户开放”政策，其要点为：
    （一）各国在中国任何所谓“势力范围”或租借地内之通商口岸或投资事业，彼此不得加以干涉。
    （二）中国之现行关税率，对于一切“势力范围”内之口岸装卸之一切货物，无论属于何国均为适用。
    （三）此种“势力范围”内之任何口岸，对他国船舶，不得课以较对本国船舶为高之码头税，又在此种“势力范围”内敷设管理或经营之铁路，运输属于他国之货物，所有运费，不得较其本国为高。
