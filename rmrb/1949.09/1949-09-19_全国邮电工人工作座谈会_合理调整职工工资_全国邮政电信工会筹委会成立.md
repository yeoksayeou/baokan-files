Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 18th:

　　The National Postal and Telecommunications Workers' Work Forum, convened by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, concluded on the 5th of this month after lasting eleven days.  Thirty-seven representatives of postal and telecommunications workers and administrative personnel from major liberated areas such as the Northeast and North China, as well as major cities such as Nanjing, Shanghai, Beiping, and Tianjin, attended the meeting.  At the meeting, a Preparatory Committee for the National Postal Workers' Union and a Preparatory Committee for the National Telecommunications Workers' Union were established to prepare for the convening of the National Postal Workers' Representative Conference and the National Telecommunications Workers' Representative Conference, and to establish the National Postal Workers' Union and the National Telecommunications Workers' Union. The forum also suggested to the soon-to-be-established Central People's Government that a National Postal Bureau be established promptly after the establishment of the Central People's Government to uniformly lead the national postal service.

　　The forum focused on discussing three issues: the wages and benefits of postal and telecommunications workers, and the proper handling of redundant personnel. These issues are currently in urgent need of appropriate resolution within the postal and telecommunications systems.  After discussion, the representatives reached a consensus on the above issues, and finally, Zhu Xuefan, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, gave a summary. The forum believed that postal and telecommunications workers in various regions should actively develop their businesses and increase revenue. At the same time, in order to take into account the current financial difficulties of the country, wages and benefits should be appropriately reduced, and redundant personnel should be streamlined, in order to achieve the goals of benefiting both the public and private sectors and developing the business.  Regarding the issue of wages, the meeting believed that in the past, the wages of postal and telecommunications workers were generally much higher than the wages of workers in heavy industries such as steel, ordnance, and railways. This is unreasonable and inconsistent with the "to each according to his work" wage principle of the New Democratic society. Moreover, the revenue of postal and telecommunications businesses generally falls short of expenditures. For example, the revenue of Wuhan Post Office only accounts for about 10% of wage expenditures, Beiping accounts for about 30%, and even Tianjin, which has the best revenue, is only sufficient to cover wage expenditures. Therefore, if wages are not appropriately adjusted, it will be difficult for the postal and telecommunications industries to maintain the status quo, let alone rapidly recover and develop. For this reason, the forum unanimously agreed to make appropriate and reasonable adjustments to the wages of postal and telecommunications workers across the country. The wages of postal and telecommunications workers in Beiping and Tianjin have been automatically reduced since June and July. The former has been reduced by an average of more than 27%, and the latter has been reduced by an average of 32%. Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Wuhan, Xi'an and other places have also made adjustments successively. Other regions where wages are still too high should immediately reduce the overall average wage by 20% to 30% and implement this as soon as possible. Regarding employee welfare, the forum hoped that the government would promptly adopt the labor insurance regulations already implemented in the Northeast and implement labor insurance. At the same time, the forum determined the principle of relying on employees' own unity and mutual assistance to run welfare programs, in order to correct the incorrect idea of solely relying on the administrative side to fund welfare programs. Before the new labor insurance system is implemented, the original, unreasonable so-called welfare programs should be abolished; if reasonable welfare programs cannot be fully implemented at present due to limited economic strength, then employees should be informed in detail, and the benefits should be issued with appropriate discounts, striving to conform to the principle of benefiting both the public and private sectors in order to achieve the goal of developing production.  On the issue of personnel, due to the long-term rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries in the past, the personnel system of the postal and telecommunications systems had unreasonable phenomena such as too many redundant personnel, mismatched functions, and unreasonable promotions and demotions. If these phenomena are not appropriately and reasonably resolved, not only will the country's financial expenditures suffer great losses, but also the work enthusiasm and creativity of postal and telecommunications workers will be difficult to unleash and improve. For this reason, the forum agreed that it is necessary to make reasonable and necessary adjustments and streamlining of personnel to make it consistent with the principles of enterprise management.

　　At the end of the forum, an open letter to postal and telecommunications workers across the country was issued, providing a detailed explanation and interpretation of the issues discussed at this forum. The letter also called on postal and telecommunications workers across the country to enhance their sense of responsibility as masters of the country, help and love each other, implement the methods of "eating sparingly, living tightly," and "five people eating the food of three people," and jointly actively find ways to overcome temporary difficulties. The forum also issued a statement strongly condemning the "White Paper" published by the U.S. government and called on postal and telecommunications workers across the country to actively participate in local Sino-Soviet Friendship Associations, learn humbly from the Soviet Union, and strive to restore and develop the people's postal and telecommunications services.

### 全国邮电工人工作座谈会　合理调整职工工资  全国邮政电信工会筹委会成立

　　全国邮电工人工作座谈会
　  合理调整职工工资
    全国邮政电信工会筹委会成立
    【新华社北平十八日电】由中华全国总工会召开的全国邮电工人工作座谈会，历时十一日，已于本月五日结束。出席会议的有东北、华北等各大解放区及南京、上海、北平、天津等各大城市邮电职工代表和行政负责人员共三十七人。会上成立了全国邮政总工会筹备委员会和电信总工会筹备委员会，以筹备召开全国邮政职工代表大会和全国电信职工代表大会，成立全国邮政总工会和电信总工会。座谈会并向行将成立的中央人民政府建议，在中央人民政府成立之后，迅速成立全国邮政总局，以统一领导全国的邮政事业。
    座谈会着重地讨论了邮电职工工资、福利和冗员的适当处理等三个问题。这些问题是目前邮电系统中所迫切需要适当解决的问题。经过讨论，代表们对上述问题都获得了一致意见，最后由中华全国总工会副主席朱学范作了总结。座谈会认为各地邮电职工应积极开展业务，增加收入，同时为照顾目前国家的财政困难，应适当地减低工资、福利等待遇，精简冗员，以达到公私兼顾、发展业务的目的。关于工资问题，会议认为过去邮电职工的工资一般都比钢铁、兵工和铁路等重工业工人的工资高得很多。这是不合理的，是不合于新民主主义社会“按劳付酬”的工资原则的。而且目前邮政和电信的营业一般都是入不敷出，如武汉邮政收入只占工资支出的百分之十左右，北平占百分之三十左右，收入最好的天津也仅够开支工资。因此，如果工资不加以适当调整，则邮电事业很难维持现状，更不易迅速恢复和发展。为此，座谈会一致同意对全国邮电职工的工资，加以适当的、合理的调整。北平、天津邮政职工的工资从六、七月份起已自动降低。前者平均降低了百分之二十七以上，后者平均降低了百分之三十二。上海、南京、杭州、武汉、西安各地也先后作了调整。其他工资还过高的地区，应即按总平均工资减低百分之二十到三十，并尽速实行。关于职工福利事业，座谈会希望政府尽速采纳东北所已实行的劳动保险条例，实施劳动保险；同时座谈会确定了依靠职工自己团结互助来举办福利事业的方针，以纠正某些单纯依靠行政方面出钱举办福利事业的不正确思想。在新的劳动保险制度尚未实施以前，对于原有的、不合理的所谓福利事业，应予取消；合理的福利事业目前因限于经济力量不能全部实施时，则向职工详细说明，酌量折扣发给，力求合乎公私兼顾的原则，以达到发展生产的目的。在人员问题上，由于过去国民党反动派的长期统治，邮政、电信系统的人事制度存在着冗员太多、职能不称、升降不合理等不合理现象。这种现象如不加以适当的、合理的解决，则不仅国家财政开支受到很大损失，而且邮电职工的工作积极性、创造性都难以发挥和提高。为此，座谈会同意必须对人员加以合理的必要的调整和精简，使之合于企业化的原则。
    座谈会结束时发表了一封致全国邮电职工的公开信，对此次座谈会所讨论的问题作了详细的说明和解释。该信并号召全国邮电职工提高国家主人翁的责任感，互助互爱，实行“省着吃，挤着住”，“三个人的饭五个人吃”的办法，共同积极设法克服暂时的困难。座谈会并发表声明，严斥美国政府所发表的“白皮书”，号召全国邮电职工积极参加当地的中苏友好协会，虚心向苏联学习，努力恢复与发展人民的邮电事业。
