　　Fujian People's Government Established
  　Tan Kah Kee Sends Congratulatory Telegram
    Mr. Tan Kah Kee, leader of overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia, recently sent a telegram congratulating the establishment of the Fujian People's Government. The telegram reads:

    Chairman Zhang Dingcheng, Vice Chairman Fang Yi, Vice Chairman and Commander Ye Fei: Our Fujian province has many mountains and little farmland, and the people suffer from poverty. Many go abroad, but few return home. After the defeat of the Japanese invaders, various ethnic groups in Southeast Asia sought liberation and were subjected to armed oppression by imperialism. Overseas Chinese suffered significant property losses in the war, and unemployment increased daily. The province had already suffered the horrors of the War of Resistance Against Japan, and then faced the cutoff of foreign exchange. This was followed by the outbreak of civil war, the Kuomintang's cruelty, and the imposition of harsh policies, resulting in indescribable misery. The people of Fujian, both at home and abroad, longed for liberation like a drought year for rain. The news of the army entering Fujian and the liberation of famous cities meant that our goal was about to be achieved. The establishment of the People's Government and the military region, and your appointment as chairman and commander, is celebrated by all the people of Fujian. I hereby extend my congratulations and hope that the entire province will be liberated quickly, saving the people from fire and water, promoting benefits and eliminating evils. I pray for this with utmost sincerity.

    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Chairman of the Southeast Asian Fujianese Association Tan Kah Kee

　　福建人民政府成立
  　陈嘉庚驰电祝贺
    【新华社北平二日电】南洋华侨领袖陈嘉庚氏顷电贺福建人民政府成立。电称：
    张鼎丞主席，方毅副主席、叶飞副主席兼司令员：吾闽山多田少，民生困苦，出洋者众，回乡者寡。日寇败后，南洋各民族为求解放，受帝国主义武力压迫，华侨在战争中财产损失重大，失业日增。省内既受抗战惨祸；又遭外汇断绝。继以内战爆发，蒋党凶残，苛政百出，凄惨情况，莫可言喻。中外闽民，盼望解放，若大旱之望雨。电传大军入闽，名城解放，目的将达，人民政府及军区成立，公等荣膺主席及军旅之寄，闽民咸庆得人。谨此弛贺，并盼全省迅速解放，救民水火，兴利除弊，无任祷切。
