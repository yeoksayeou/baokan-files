　　We Guard Tsinghua University
    Qinghua Communication Group
    Tsinghua University had already established a Security Committee. Prior to this, a series of disturbances and thefts had occurred on campus. These saboteurs were either Three Youth League squad leaders, Three Youth League members, or demobilized soldiers. This further aroused the vigilance of the entire university.

    After the vacation, under the leadership of the Security Committee and relying on all Tsinghua personnel, the campus has consistently maintained good order.

    The Security Committee includes representatives from the faculty and staff union, the labor union, the student union, and the housewives' association. It has departments for general affairs, security, protection, and accommodation management. The General Affairs Department uses various forms, such as wall posters, mimeographed publications, oral reports, and exhibitions, for publicity. The Security Department organized a patrol team of 100 students and 80 workers. During the recent enrollment examination, they patrolled to ensure the safety and order of the campus. Teachers, students, and workers from the departments of Physics, Biology, Mechanical Engineering, and Civil Engineering jointly discussed how to protect their department buildings and formed patrol groups. Doors and windows were locked after work to restrict access.

    After the establishment of the dormitory committees in each dormitory, unnecessary doors have been sealed. A zoning system has been implemented, with students from the same department and grade living together, ensuring order within the dormitories. In the faculty and staff residential area, patrol groups have also been organized. For example, the teachers in Shengyin Courtyard divided the entire area into several groups, with the group leader serving as the patrolman for that area. This makes the organization even tighter.

    Fire prevention work has also been given special attention. Fire extinguishers have been repaired, fire extinguishing bombs have been placed in each dormitory and building, and fire sandboxes have been set up. In the event of a fire or other emergency, the alarm bell will summon firefighters and teachers and students to the scene. The patrol team will also immediately dispatch patrols to each area to prevent sabotage by criminals.

    After the accommodation management regulations were established, it became even more difficult for bad elements to infiltrate Tsinghua. The regulations stipulate that non-university personnel borrowing accommodation on campus must register and have a guarantor. The Accommodation Management Department conducts regular inspections. On August 13th, a surprise inspection of student dormitories revealed that a small number of students were still not complying with the Security Committee's decision by allowing relatives and friends to stay overnight without registering. They have been advised to register in accordance with the regulations. After this inspection, accommodation management has generally been given more attention.

    From the establishment of the Security Committee to the consolidation of order, we have learned that to do a good job in school security, it is necessary to mobilize the broad masses of teachers, students, workers, and police, so that everyone becomes the most active guard; at the same time, there must be a strict organization to eliminate the loose phenomenon in the school in the past.

　　我们警卫着清华园
    清华通讯组
    清华大学早就成立了保卫委员会。在这以前，校园内曾发生过一连串的扰乱秩序和偷窃事件。这些破坏者，不是三青团小队长便是三青团员或流散军人。这样更引起了全校的警惕。
    放假后，在保委会领导之下，依靠全体清华人，园内始终保持着良好的秩序。
    保委会包括校内教职联、工会、学生会和家庭妇女会。下设总务、警卫、防护、住宿管理等课。总务课用墙报、油印刊物、口头报告及展览会等各种形式来宣传。警卫课组织了包括一百同学和八十位工友的纠察队。在这次招生考试时，他们出动巡查，保证了园内的安全和秩序。物理、生物、机械、土木等系师生工友共同讨论了怎样保卫系馆，组成了纠察小组。下班后门窗加锁，限制出入。
    同学宿舍在各斋斋委会成立后，已钉封了不必要的门。并实行了同系级同学住在一起的分区住宿办法，保证了斋内秩序。在教职员住宅区里，也组织起纠察小组。象胜因院的先生们还把全区分成了若干组，组长是本区的纠察。这样，组织更严密了。
    防火的工作也被特别注意。灭火机修理好了，各斋各馆都挂有灭火弹，还放置了消防沙箱。如果遇有火警或其他紧急事件，警报钟声便会将消防队员和先生同学召集到出事地点。纠察队也马上会出动到各区巡查，以防歹徒破坏。
    住宿管理的办法规定以后，坏分子更不容易侵入清华了。办法规定：非本校人士而在校内借住者，一定要办理登记，有人保证才行。住宿管理课经常检查，八月十三号突击检查了同学宿舍，发现仍有少数同学不遵守保委会的决定，留宿亲友而没有办理登记，已分别劝导依照规定去登记。这次检查以后，对住宿管理一般地都重视起来了。
    从保委会的成立到秩序巩固起来的这一段工作中，我们得到这样的经验，要把学校保卫工作做好，一定要发动广大的师生工警，使每一个人都成为最积极的警卫员；同时还要有严密的组织，消除过去学校中的松散现象。
