　　The First Field Army Issues Instructions
　  To Strengthen Publicity Work in New Areas
    Focusing on the Specific Circumstances of the Northwest, Complete the Task of Being Both a Fighting Force and a Working Team.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northwest Front] The Political Department of the People's Liberation Army's First Field Army, which is advancing far into Gansu, recently issued instructions to strengthen mass propaganda work in the new areas, based on the specific circumstances of the Northwest. The instructions pointed out that due to the sparse population, scattered villages, and mixed Han and Hui populations in the vast areas of the Northwest, the previous methods of collective propaganda are no longer applicable. Individual propaganda methods must be adopted, conducting propaganda in one village at a time, in one household at a time, and to one person at a time. At the same time, it is necessary to earnestly implement the mass work of "doing work in every courtyard you stay in," that is, the mass work system of "contracting work by courtyard." All units should regularly check the propaganda situation of the propaganda teams in the companies and earnestly implement the task of our army being both a fighting force and a working team. The instructions further pointed out that Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai are areas where the Hui and Han people live together. The reactionary Greater Han chauvinist policy of the reactionaries has created estrangement and hatred between the Hui and Han people. Since our army has had cruel battles with the Ma bandits from the civil war to the liberation war, there is a widespread and deep-seated hatred for the bandit army throughout the army. However, it is essential to distinguish between the Ma bandit army that oppressed the people and the oppressed Hui people, and to distinguish between the few reactionary elements in the Ma bandit army and the vast number of soldiers oppressed by the Ma bandits. In the propaganda, it is necessary to focus on exposing the Ma bandits' heinous crimes of heavy taxation, conscription, and grain robbery against the Hui people, publicize our army's policy on ethnic minorities, and enlighten the class consciousness of the Hui people. Secondly, due to the backward culture and inconvenient transportation in Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai, the masses do not have a sufficient understanding of the situation of the nationwide victory and the various policies of the New Democracy regarding industry, commerce, finance, agriculture, animal husbandry, and burdens. Therefore, it is necessary to widely publicize the strength of the People's Liberation Army and the absolute advantage of our army on the Northwest battlefield, publicize the land policy and the rational burden financial policy of the People's Government, and especially explain our army's method of pre-borrowing military grain and grass. In addition, it is necessary to widely publicize the advantages of the Renminbi, explaining that it is based on solid state assets and the enthusiastic support of the broad masses of people. Finally, the instructions called on the entire army to implement the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention, especially to strictly respect the customs and habits of the Hui people, and to influence the masses with practical actions.

　　第一野战军发布指示
　  加强新区宣传工作
    针对西北具体情况，完成战斗队又为工作队的任务。
    【新华社西北前线电】远向甘肃长驱挺进的人民解放军第一野战军政治部，日前根据西北具体情况，发布加强新区群众宣传工作的指示，该指示指出：由于西北广大地区，人烟稀少，村落分散，回汉杂居，以往集体宣传的方式，已不适用，必须采取个别的宣传方式，到一村宣传一村，住一户宣传一户，遇一人宣传一人。同时，切实执行住一院做一院的群众工作，即所谓“房院包工制”的群众工作制度。各部应经常检查连队中宣传组宣传的情形，认真执行我军为战斗队同时又为工作队的任务。指示继指出：甘、宁、青各地，是回汉杂居的地区，反动派的大汉族政策，造成了回汉之间的隔阂及仇恨。而我军由于和马匪从内战到解放战争，都有过残酷的战斗，全军中普遍存在着对匪军深刻的仇恨，但一定要注意把压迫人民的马匪军和被压迫的回民分别开来，把马匪军中少数反动分子和广大的被马匪所压迫的士兵分别开来。在宣传中要着重揭露马匪对于回民的横征暴敛抓丁抢粮的罪恶行为，宣传我军的少数民族政策，启发回民的阶级觉悟。其次，由于甘、宁、青各地文化落后，交通不便，群众对于全国胜利形势及新民主主义工商、金融、农牧、负担等各种政策都了解不够，因此应广泛宣扬人民解放军的力量及西北战场我军占绝对优势的形势，宣传人民政府的土地政策和合理负担的财政政策，特别应该讲解我军预借军粮军草的办法。此外要广泛宣传人民币的优点，说明它有雄厚的国家资产作基础及广大人民的热烈拥护。最后指示号召全军贯彻三大纪律八项注意，特别要严格尊重回民风俗习惯，以实际行动来影响群众。
