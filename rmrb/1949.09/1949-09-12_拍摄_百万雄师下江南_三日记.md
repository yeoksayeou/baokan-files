　　Three Days of Filming "A Million Soldiers Cross the Yangtze"

  　April 21st
    The Crossing-the-Yangtze Campaign marked the shift of the powerful armed forces of the Chinese People's Revolution from the north to the south, signifying the liberation of all of China. This future film should record how, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the mighty People's Liberation Army and the people supporting the war, especially the heroic boatmen, broke through the enemy's Yangtze River defense line stretching for thousands of miles and the heroic historical events of liberating the Jing (Nanjing), Hu (Shanghai), and Hang (Hangzhou) areas. It bears a very important responsibility to the audience and to history. This made me, who had always been confident in the face of various difficulties, feel a shiver of trepidation at this task.
    The long-awaited order to cross the river finally arrived today. Little Zhou and I hurriedly prepared the camera and film. We wiped and checked the camera repeatedly, still feeling uneasy, fearing it might malfunction when needed. I don't know if it was due to the tension of going to the battlefield or the excitement, but my heart was pounding all day long.
    Night came, and the boat sailed from the narrow river to the Yangtze River. Assault teams moved forward quietly, one after another. At eleven o'clock, more than forty sailboats carrying these invincible warriors advanced towards the south. The conditions of the night restricted me, preventing me from recording such heroic and vivid scenes. Nineteen minutes later, red signal flares indicating arrival on the south bank shot into the sky, one after another. The enemy discovered us, and bullets were fired from the bunkers on the south bank. Our artillery on the north bank and the soldiers on the boats also opened fire on the enemy. Under the enemy's flares, I watched our soldiers jump from the boats and rush ashore; the enemy fled or surrendered their weapons. At this time, my camera could not be started. As dawn approached, I went to another crossing point and filmed some material, but unfortunately, the most exciting and moving scenes had already passed.
    The task of crossing the river was victoriously completed, but because the most vivid and exciting shots were not captured, I felt distressed and considered it the greatest regret. I thought that other brother teams along the river, due to different crossing times, would surely capture better material and accomplish the task of telling the people about the great Crossing-the-Yangtze Campaign through cinematic images.
    April 24th
    The rain fell day and night, and the troops relentlessly pursued the enemy, traveling at least a hundred li or more each day. Most of the comrades' feet were swollen. All the commanders and fighters put forward the heroic slogan "Catching up is Victory."
    Today, at two o'clock, we reached a large mountain, said to be the old base area of the New Fourth Army. The rain grew heavier, and the soldiers ran faster and faster. In order to prevent the enemy from escaping, they had to catch up and overwhelm them. I took out the camera, and Little Zhou covered it with a rain cloth, capturing several shots of the soldiers chasing the enemy in the muddy rice paddies and rugged mountain roads of the south. After filming nearly a hundred feet, the rear units had also passed by, so we quickly packed up the camera and chased after the troops. When we caught up with the troops, we were both covered in mud like mud monkeys.
    April 26th
    Day and night pursuit, utterly exhausted, we fell asleep by the wall. Comrade Lu Ming from the Xinhua Branch hurriedly woke us up, telling us that near Liyang County on the Jing-Hang (Nanjing-Hangzhou) National Highway, one of our regiments had captured more than 10,000 enemy soldiers. Hearing this news, all sleepiness vanished, and we immediately shouldered the camera and ran. The straight and wide Jing-Hang National Highway was filled with cannons, guns, bullets, shells, medicines, clothes, bedding, cooking pots, and carts discarded by the routed Chiang bandits. Our soldiers jumped over these messy obstacles to pursue the enemy. I excitedly filmed the panicked state of the enemy as they fled and the heroic posture of our soldiers pursuing them from both the front and the rear. Soon, waves upon waves of countless prisoners were escorted down. A soldier shouted at me, "Comrade filmmaker, take a picture of us. Look, we've captured quite a few, haven't we!?" I started the camera, and through the viewfinder, I saw his excited, happy, and victorious face walk past the lens.
    Victory! Today is the happiest day for the soldiers and the most successful day for our work; in a short while, we filmed three hundred feet. Little Zhou and I smiled at each other knowingly.
    In the afternoon, we heard that the pursuit and annihilation battle in Yixing had also ended victoriously; so we discussed with the unit leaders and decided to temporarily return to Nanjing, join up with other brother teams, and prepare to concentrate our efforts on filming the liberation of Greater Shanghai.

　　拍摄“百万雄师下江南”三日记
    郝玉生
  　四月二十一日
    渡江作战是中国人民革命的强大武装力量从北方引向南方，是解放全中国的标志。这部未来的影片，应当记录下在毛主席领导下，强大的人民解放军和支援战争的人民，特别是英勇的船工，如何突破敌人千里江防的长江与解放京沪杭的英勇史迹。它在观众和历史面前，负着很重要的责任，使一贯在各种困难面前自负的我，在这个任务面前也感到战栗了。
    期待好久的渡江命令今天终于来了，小周和我急忙的准备机器和底片。我们将机器擦了又擦，看了又看，总不放心，恐怕到用时出毛病。我不知是由于上战场的紧张或是太兴奋的缘故，一整天，心里总是扑通扑通的跳。
    夜来了，船从狭江开到长江边，突击队悄悄的一个接着一个向前运动。十一点钟，四十几只帆船载着这些无敌的勇士们，一齐向南挺进。夜底条件限制住了我，使这样英勇生动的场面不能记录下来。十九分钟后，抵达南岸的红信号弹，一个接一个飞向天空。敌人发现了，子弹从南岸的碉堡里射过来。我们北岸的大炮和船上的战士们也向敌人开了火。在敌人的照明弹下，我眼看着我们的战士从船上跳下来冲上岸去；敌人逃的逃，缴枪的缴枪。这时我的摄影机却不能开动。天将快明的时候，又到另一渡口上拍了一点材料，可惜最精彩最动人的场面却早已过去。
    渡江任务胜利的完成了，可是因为最生动最精彩的镜头没有拍下来，心里难受，感到这是最大的遗憾。我想着其他沿江的兄弟队，因渡江时间不同，一定会拍到较好的材料，完成伟大的千里渡江用电影形象告诉给人民的任务。
    四月二十四日
    雨日夜不停的下，队伍日夜不停的追击敌人，每天至少也要走一百里以上，大部分同志脚都走肿了。全体指战员提出“追上就是胜利”的英雄口号。
    今天两点钟走到一座大山前，据说这座山是从前新四军老根据地。雨越来越大，战士们越跑越快，为了不让敌人逃掉只有追上去，拥过去。我把机器拿出来，小周把雨布遮在上面，将战士们在南方泥泞的稻田小路上和崎岖的山路上冒雨追击的情景拍了几个镜头。拍了将近一百英尺，后尾部队也已过去，我们赶紧将机器装起来追赶队伍。当我们追上队伍时，两个人都摔的成了个泥猴。
    四月二十六日
    日以继夜的追击，疲乏透啦，倒在墙边就睡起来。新华支社陆明同志急急忙忙把我们叫起来，告诉我们在京杭国道上溧阳县附近，我们一个团俘虏敌人一万多。听到这消息，睡意早不翼而飞，立即背上机器就跑。一条挺直宽阔的京杭国道被蒋匪溃兵扔下的炮、枪、子弹、炮弹、药品、衣服、被褥、行军锅、大车堆的满满的，我们的战士便跳过这些乱七八糟的绊脚物向前追。我兴奋地前前后后地拍敌人逃跑时遗留下来的狼狈相，和我们战士追击的英勇姿态。不一会，一队接着一队的数不清的俘虏押下来了，一个战士大声喊着我：“拍电影的同志给我们照一张。你看，我们抓的不算少吧！？”我开动了机器，从取景框里，看见他兴奋、愉快、胜利的脸从镜头前面走过去。
    胜利了。今天是战士们最愉快的一天，也是我们工作最顺利的一天；不一会拍了三百英尺，我和小周面对面的会心的笑了。
    下午听说宜兴方面追击围歼战，也已胜利结束了；于是和部队首长商议，我们暂时赶回南京，同其他兄弟队会合，准备再集中力量拍解放大上海的材料。
