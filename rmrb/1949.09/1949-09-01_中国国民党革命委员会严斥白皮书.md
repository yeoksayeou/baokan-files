The so-called "United States Relations with China" White Paper and other related documents, published by U.S. imperialism on August 5th of this year, is, as the New China News Agency editorial title put it on August 13th, a "helpless confession."

Some say: This is a confession made without being beaten, which is not in accordance with the facts. It was beaten out, and it was beaten out with severe torture. Who was the judge who interrogated it, and who was the executioner? It was none other than the world's toiling masses under its oppression, exploitation, aggression, and enslavement, the Chinese toiling masses, especially the Chinese proletariat and its party—the Chinese Communist Party, leading the Chinese toiling masses. See how Acheson, with a mourning face, says: "The unfortunate but inevitable fact is that the unfortunate result of the Chinese civil war (meaning being defeated by U.S. imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang it supported) was beyond the control of the U.S. government. What the United States has done or could do within the reasonable limits of its capabilities (meaning "more than fifty percent of the monetary expenditure" and "most of the military supplies" to aid Chiang) could not change this result. What the United States did not do also had no impact on this result. This is the product of internal forces in China (meaning the forces of the Chinese toiling masses), which the United States also tried to influence, but could not effectively." This is the severe torture that the Chinese toiling masses inflicted on U.S. imperialism, under which it had no choice but to confess this confession.

What did it confess?

First, it confessed that the world's toiling masses and the Chinese toiling masses are the mortal enemies of U.S. imperialism, and the Soviet Union, which represents the interests of the world's toiling masses, and the Communist Party, which represents the interests of the Chinese toiling masses, are also the mortal enemies of U.S. imperialism. In the eyes of U.S. imperialism, the cover of world history after World War II is already marked with the "American Century," and the whole world should be the market or colony of Wall Street financial oligarchs. China—a market of nearly 500 million people, a land almost as large as two Europes—should not only but certainly belong to Wall Street financial oligarchs. However, the bold Chinese toiling masses and the Chinese Communist Party, representing the Chinese toiling masses, simply refused to listen and rejected its invasion. The bold Soviet Union, representing the interests of the world's toiling masses, also hindered its aggressive actions. Undoubtedly, these are all its mortal enemies, and it must be hostile to them to the end.

Second, it confessed that U.S. imperialism must interfere in China's internal affairs, must invade China, must turn China into a U.S. colony, must oppress, exploit, and enslave the Chinese toiling masses, and therefore must support China's dictatorial, traitorous, and bellicose Kuomintang reactionaries, oppose the Chinese people, slaughter the Chinese people, and even eliminate the Communist Party, which represents the interests of the Chinese toiling masses. See how Acheson tears off the hypocritical mask, nakedly revealing its blue-faced and fanged true nature, saying: "Large-scale military intervention to aid the Kuomintang in destroying the Communist Party" is one of the three choices in its China policy.

Third, it confessed that U.S. imperialism's interference in China's internal affairs, its aid to the Kuomintang reactionaries, and its policy of turning China into a U.S. colony have all failed. However, it shamelessly attributes the responsibility for the failure to the incompetence of the Kuomintang reactionaries and the obstruction of the Soviet Union. However, it will continue to interfere and invade, and insists on continuing its policy of interfering and invading China. This is expressed in the five principles of Acheson's statement, according to which "the U.S. government will continue to recruit various colored saboteurs at home and abroad to disrupt the solemn and beautiful motherland of the Chinese people, to disrupt the democratic forces of the Soviet Union and the world's people, and to disrupt peace in the East and the West." (See the New China News Agency editorial of August 13th.) Among the various colored saboteurs, it especially favors the so-called "democratic individualist" elements. See how Acheson says very proudly and with seeming assurance: "China's long civilization and democratic individualism will eventually triumph again, and China will eventually overthrow the foreign system."

Aggression, failure; failure, continue aggression. What will be the result? The logic of the development of things is inevitably: further failure. Aggression, being beaten; being beaten, continue aggression. What will be the result? The logic of the development of things is inevitably: being beaten again. This is the gist of the entire confession.

To be enemies with the world's toiling masses and the Chinese toiling masses, to be enemies with the Soviet Union, which represents the interests of the world's toiling masses, and the Communist Party, which represents the interests of the Chinese toiling masses—in a word: anti-Soviet, anti-communist, anti-people. To be friends with the world's few big landlords and big capitalists and China's few big landlords and big capitalists, to be friends with all the reactionaries representing the interests of the world's few big landlords and big capitalists and the Kuomintang reactionaries representing the interests of China's few big landlords and big capitalists, to aid them, unite them around the "American Century," form an anti-Soviet, anti-communist, anti-people united front, and use it to confront or even attempt to eliminate the anti-imperialist democratic and peaceful united front headed by the Soviet Union—this is the essence of the entire confession.

Thank you, U.S. imperialism. Those of us in China who had illusions about U.S. imperialism in the past, that is, those who had accepted the propaganda and deception of U.S. imperialism and its running dogs, the Kuomintang reactionaries, have all learned the following clear and most precious lessons from this lovely and frank confession:

(1) U.S. imperialism (not the American people) is irreconcilable with the Chinese toiling masses, the Communist Party representing the interests of the Chinese toiling masses, and all democratic parties. If the U.S. government does not abandon its imperialist policy for a single day, there is absolutely no room for reconciliation between the Chinese people, the Chinese Communist Party, and all democratic parties and it cannot be hoped that it will talk about equality and mutual benefit with the People's China.

(2) The U.S. imperialist bloc, representing the interests of the few big landlords and big capitalists, is also irreconcilable with the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries of Eastern Europe, which represent the interests of the world's toiling masses. If the U.S. government does not abandon its imperialist policy for a single day, the Soviet Union, the new democratic countries of Eastern Europe, and even the world's toiling masses, including the American toiling masses, will have absolutely no room for reconciliation with it. It cannot be hoped that it will talk about equality and mutual benefit, or even temporary peaceful coexistence, with the Soviet Union, the new democratic countries of Eastern Europe, and all toiling masses.

(3) To make it temporarily and permanently abandon its imperialist policy, one must prepare to fight it, carry the people's revolutionary war to the end, expose the nature of imperialism, eliminate the remaining forces of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, its running dogs in China, and suppress all kinds of colored saboteurs, "only allow them to be well-behaved, and not allow them to talk and act recklessly" (Mao Zedong's words). Being afraid of provoking it is not feasible, and begging it is even less feasible.

(4) To make our struggle against imperialism lead to victory, and to make it finally abandon its imperialist policy, we must step up mobilization, "arouse the masses and unite with the nations of the world that treat us equally to fight together" (Sun Yat-sen's words). In particular, we must strengthen, consolidate, and support the bastion of world democratic peace, the Soviet Union, which represents the interests of the world's toiling masses. Stand on the side of the Soviet Union, stand on the side of the anti-imperialist democratic and peaceful united front, stand on the side of truth, and stand on the side of the world's toiling masses. That is to say, we must follow the instructions of the Chinese Communist Party and the leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao: "Lean to one side." "Leaning to one side is what Mr. Sun Yat-sen's forty years of experience and the Communist Party's twenty-eight years of experience have taught us. We deeply know that to achieve victory and consolidate victory, we must lean to one side." Leaning to one side, it can also be said, is what U.S. imperialism's 1,054-page White Paper has taught us. We deeply know that to make our struggle against imperialism lead to victory, and to make it finally abandon its imperialist policy, we must lean to one side.

The above clear and most precious lessons are indeed taught to us by this "helpless confession"—the White Paper. In this respect alone, this confession does indeed appear frank and lovely. However, we must pay special attention: Any robber, especially an imperialist robber, when it is under severe torture by the world's toiling masses, especially the Chinese toiling masses, certainly cannot help but honestly confess some of its robber acts; but the imperialist robber is always accustomed to and good at placing all its robber acts under the concealment of some dignified, beautiful, pleasant-sounding things that some people once had a weakness for and still stubbornly cling to. What is the outer skin that U.S. imperialism covers its 1,054-page-long White Paper with? It is what Acheson said: "China's long civilization and democratic individualism will eventually triumph again, and China will eventually overthrow the foreign system." He seems to be saying: U.S. imperialism is not interfering in or invading China, but is protecting China's long civilization and democratic individualism, and helping China overthrow the foreign system.

China's long civilization is something that some Chinese people have indeed had a weakness for and still stubbornly cling to. Democratic individualism, that is, old democracy, Anglo-American democracy, is indeed something that some Chinese people have had a weakness for and still stubbornly cling to. Opposing and firmly rejecting foreign systems can be said to be a general manifestation of national character, and the Chinese nation is no exception.

However, is U.S. imperialism really going to protect China's long civilization and democratic individualism, and help China overthrow the foreign system? Since we have exposed the essence of all its robber acts from its helpless long confession, we must also tear off the beautiful and dignified outer skin that covers all its robber acts.

Let's first analyze what it calls "democratic individualism." As mentioned earlier, this is the old democracy, Anglo-American democracy, especially American democracy with the traditions of Washington, Jefferson, and Lincoln. At that time, it did have its progressive and revolutionary nature. But in today's America, it has been strangled by the so-called Truman Doctrine, Marshall Plan, and Acheson Doctrine. The democracy in the mouths of Truman, Marshall, and Acheson is a democracy that takes anti-Soviet, anti-communist, anti-people, and supporting the interests of the few big landlords and big capitalists as a necessary and minimum condition. If you are a democratic individualist, you must be anti-Soviet, anti-communist, anti-people, and support the interests of the few monopoly capitalists on Wall Street. Otherwise, you are a communist, and you will be reported by the Un-American Activities Committee, and you will not be able to enjoy any of the slightest rights that old democracy should give you. Old democracy has been strangled by U.S. imperialism, but it still wants to peddle the legacy of old democracy in front of the world's people and the Chinese people, and say that all its anti-Soviet, anti-communist, and anti-people robber acts are righteous deeds to protect world democracy. Therefore, what it calls China's long civilization and democratic individualism will eventually triumph again, which means that China's reactionaries, anti-Soviet, anti-communist, and anti-people elements, will eventually triumph again. If China's "democratic individualist" elements want to be appreciated by U.S. imperialism, they must become anti-Soviet, anti-communist, anti-people elements who support the interests of China's few big landlords and big capitalists. Therefore, democratic individualism in the mouth of U.S. imperialism is just a skin to cover up all its anti-Soviet, anti-communist, and anti-people robber acts, and we must tear it apart.

Then let's dissect what it calls "foreign systems" and the "foreign system" that it wants to "overthrow." This refers to Marxism-Leninism, the social system produced by the ideological system of Marxism-Leninism, and the people's democratic dictatorship system led by the current Chinese Communist Party. To put it bluntly, it refers to all systems from the Soviet Union. U.S. imperialism believes that it must be overthrown because it is a system that "serves the interests of foreign countries and the Soviet Union." In order to overthrow this foreign system, U.S. imperialism colludes with the Kuomintang reactionaries, who are "reactionaries no different from the warlords of the past" and "have lost the support of the people." Supporting it and helping it to wholeheartedly implement the imperialist policy of colonizing China is not serving the interests of foreigners. Although this system is also foreign, to put it bluntly, because it is from the United States, it must be maintained and cannot be overthrown. Therefore, what U.S. imperialism calls "overthrowing the foreign system" is just a skin to cover up all U.S. imperialism's acts of interference and aggression against China, and we must tear it apart.

Therefore, all dignified, beautiful, pleasant-sounding things that some people once had a weakness for and still stubbornly cling to, once spoken by the mouth of an imperialist robber, we must interpret and translate them differently. Therefore, we must distinguish between the democracy of the early days of capitalism with the traditions of Washington, Jefferson, and Lincoln, that is, the old democracy, and the democratic individualism that has been changed in content and distorted in meaning by Truman, Marshall, and Acheson in the era of imperialism, especially the democratic individualism that is being peddled in China. The former had its progressive and revolutionary nature, while the latter is just a guise for anti-Soviet, anti-communist, and anti-people, and is completely reactionary and counter-revolutionary. We must distinguish between the foreign system from the Soviet Union and the foreign system from the United States. The former is the ideological system of Marxism-Leninism that conforms to the interests of the world's proletariat and all toiling masses, and is the social system produced by the ideological system of Marxism-Leninism that conforms to the interests of the world's proletariat and all toiling masses. This system is being established and increasingly consolidated in the Soviet Union, China, and Eastern Europe, and it will also be established in the whole world, including the United States, and it is impossible to overthrow it. The latter is the imperialist ideological system that conforms to the interests of the world's big landlords and big capitalists, and the social system of colonizing China produced by the imperialist ideological system. This is what needs to be overthrown, and the Chinese people will inevitably overthrow it. Once we have distinguished all of these clearly, we will not be afraid of the distortions and slanders of imperialism, but the distortions and slanders of imperialism are used to the extreme. Chapter 2 of the White Paper published by U.S. imperialism maliciously distorts the cooperation between Mr. Sun Yat-sen and the Chinese Communist Party, maliciously obliterates Mr. Sun's progressive propositions, such as the policy of alliance with the Soviet Union, the policy of alliance with the Communist Party, the policy of assisting workers and peasants, opposition to imperialism, opposition to the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, and the proposition that tillers should have their own land, etc. At the same time, it also maliciously slanders Mr. Sun as having opposed class struggle, thereby also opposing the foreign system from the Soviet Union. Of course, we will never deny that Mr. Sun was limited by the historical background and social conditions of a certain period, and had conservative elements in his past ideology. However, our evaluation of a historical figure must be based on his final words and deeds. In his will to the Soviet Union before his death, Mr. Sun wrote painfully, solemnly, and sincerely: "I am suffering from an incurable disease here. My thoughts at this moment turn to you, to my party, and to the future of my country. You are the leaders of the great union of free republics. This great union of free republics is the true legacy left by the immortal Lenin to the world's oppressed nations. The refugees of imperialism will use this to defend their freedom and seek liberation from the international system based on ancient slavery, war, and favoritism. I leave behind the Kuomintang. I hope that the Kuomintang will work together with you in completing its historical task of liberating China and other invaded countries from the imperialist system. Fate requires me to put down the unfinished business and hand it over to those who adhere to the teachings of Kuomintang principles and organize my true comrades. Therefore, I bequeath to the Kuomintang the work of carrying out the national revolutionary movement, so that China can be spared the semi-colonial shackles imposed on China by imperialism. To achieve this goal, I have ordered the Kuomintang to continue to cooperate with you. I firmly believe that your government will also continue to provide us with the assistance it has provided us before. Dear comrades, as I bid farewell to you, I would like to express my warm hope that the dawn will soon break, at which time the Soviet Union will welcome a strong and independent China as a good friend and ally. The two countries will work hand in hand in the great battle to fight for the freedom of the world's oppressed nations to achieve victory. I wish you peace with brotherly friendship!"

The above is the full text of Mr. Sun's will to the Soviet Union. Stupid Mr. Truman and Mr. Acheson, if you are lucky enough to read this will, you will know how sincere the great Mr. Sun was in expressing his heartfelt sympathy to the socialist country, the Soviet Union, which was established based on the great victory of the October Revolution based on the Marxist-Leninist theory of class struggle and represents the interests of the world's proletariat and all toiling masses! Did he oppose class struggle? It should be known that the Marxist-Leninist theory of class struggle is not about maintaining classes and class struggle, but on the contrary, it is about finally eliminating classes and class struggle, that is, finally eliminating the system of oppression and exploitation. Therefore, Mr. Sun believes that the socialist country, the Soviet Union, "is the true legacy left by the immortal Lenin to the oppressed nations." This legacy "will be used by the refugees of imperialism to defend their freedom." Therefore, he "hopes that the Kuomintang will work together" with the Soviet Union "in completing its historical task of liberating China and other invaded countries from the imperialist system," hoping that China and the Soviet Union "will work hand in hand in the great battle to fight for the freedom of the world's oppressed nations to achieve victory." Therefore, he directly calls the Soviet people "dear comrades." Before his death, he also wants to "wish the Soviet people peace with brotherly friendship," and he foretold and expressed his warm hope that the dawn will soon break, "at which time the Soviet Union will welcome a strong and independent China as a good friend and ally." Now the dawn has truly broken, and the law of historical development has unreservedly confirmed the accuracy of his prediction. To say that this is a foreign system! This foreign system that conforms to the interests of the people of the whole world and also conforms to the interests of the people of the whole China is what Mr. Sun has long sincerely welcomed and wanted to put into practice. To say that this is leaning to one side! Mr. Sun also leaned to one side long ago.

Precisely because Mr. Sun sincerely welcomes the foreign system from the Soviet Union that conforms to the interests of all the people, he will inevitably oppose and overthrow the foreign system from U.S. imperialism that oppresses and exploits the people. Precisely because Mr. Sun has long leaned to one side, leaning to the side of the socialist country, the Soviet Union, he will inevitably oppose imperialism and hate imperialism with gnashing teeth. Therefore, he wants to "bequeath to the Kuomintang the work of carrying out the national revolutionary movement, so that China can be spared the semi-colonial shackles imposed on China by imperialism." Stupid Mr. Truman and Mr. Acheson, wanting to obliterate the transformation of history and regard Mr. Sun as a supporter of "democratic individualism" to win him over to their side can only be another futile effort, and it is also another most serious slander against Mr. Sun's historical evaluation.

In addition to making a solemn rebuttal to the distortion and slander of the White Paper on this point, the members of this committee, that is, those whom Mr. Sun calls "those who adhere to the teachings of Kuomintang principles and organize my true comrades," will inevitably abide by Mr. Sun's last wishes, unite with the Soviet Union, and carry out the Chinese national and democratic revolution to the end, eradicating all the remaining forces of U.S. imperialism and its running dogs, the Chiang Kai-shek group, from the root, and smashing the conspiracy of U.S. imperialism to continue to recruit various colored saboteurs to disrupt China, disrupt the Soviet Union and the world's democratic forces, and disrupt peace in the East and the West. At the same time, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, we must launch the study and discussion of the White Paper, clarify some of the previously incorrect understandings of Sino-U.S. relations, Sino-Soviet relations, Kuomintang-Communist relations, etc., determine the attitude that various democratic parties, people's organizations, and democratic people from all walks of life should take in the struggle against imperialism, and especially strive to win over as many of the so-called "democratic individualist" elements as possible, so that U.S. imperialism's future new conspiracies and tricks have no way to display their skills. In this way, the White Paper is not only a "helpless confession," but also a good educational book for some people in China with muddled thinking.

### 中国国民党革命委员会严斥白皮书

　　中国国民党革命委员会严斥白皮书
    美帝国主义于本年八月五日发表的名为“中美关系”的白皮书及其他有关文件，正如八月十三日新华社社论的标题所提出，是一篇“无可奈何的供状”。
    有人说：这是一篇不打自招的供状，却与事实不符。这是打出来的，而且是重刑拷打出来的，拷问它的法官是谁，掌刑人又是谁呢？不是别人，正是在它压迫、剥削、侵略、奴役底下的世界劳苦人民大众，中国劳苦人民大众，尤其是中国无产阶级及其政党——中国共产党所领导下的中国劳苦人民大众。试看艾奇逊哭丧着脸说：“不幸的但亦无法逃避的事实，是中国内战的不幸结果（按即指把美帝国主义及其所支持的蒋介石匪帮打败了）为美国政府控制所不及。美国在它的能力的合理限度之内，所曾经做或能够做的（按即指援蒋的“金钱支出的百分之五十以上”，以及“军需品的大部分”）都不能改变这个结果。美国所未做的对于这个结果也没有影响，这是中国内部势力（按即指中国劳苦人民大众的势力）的产物，这些势力，美国亦曾试图加以影响，但不能有效”。这就是中国劳苦人民大众，对于美帝国主义所施的重刑拷打，在重刑拷打之下它才无可奈何的招出了这篇供状。
    它供出了些什么呢？
    第一、它供出了世界劳苦人民大众和中国劳苦人民大众，是美帝国主义的死敌，代表世界劳苦人民大众利益的苏联和代表中国劳苦人民大众利益的共产党，也是美帝国主义的死敌。在美帝国主义看来，第二次世界大战后，世界历史的封面上所标的已是“美国世纪”，全世界都应该是华尔街金融寡头市场或殖民地，中国——差不多五万万人口的市场，差不多等于两个欧洲大的土地，不仅应该而且当然是属于华尔街金融寡头所有的。然而大胆的中国劳苦人民大众，及代表中国劳苦人民大众的中国共产党，偏不听话，拒绝它的侵入；而大胆的代表世界劳苦人民大众利益的苏联，也从中阻碍它的侵略行动，这无疑都是它的死敌，它一定要敌视到底。
    第二、它供出了美帝国主义，必须干涉中国内政，必须侵略中国，必须把中国变成美国的殖民地，必须压迫、剥削、奴役中国劳苦人民大众，因而必须支援中国的独裁、卖国、好战的国民党反动派，反对中国人民，屠杀中国人民，乃至消灭代表中国劳苦人民大众利益的共产党。试看艾奇逊扯脱了伪善的假面具，赤裸裸的露出它那青面獠牙的本相说：“大规模的在军事方面加以干涉、援助国民党击毁共产党”，是它对华政策的三种抉择中之一。
    第三、它供出了美帝国主义对于中国内政的干涉，对于国民党反动派的援助，对于变中国为美国殖民地的政策都失败了。不过它把失败的责任，无耻的归之于国民党反动派的无能，和苏联的阻扰。然而它还要继续干涉、侵略、并坚持继续干涉、侵略中国的政策。这表现于艾奇逊声明的五项原则，根据这五项原则，“美国政府仍然要在中国国内外继续征募各种彩色的破坏分子来捣乱中国人民的庄严美丽的祖国，来捣乱苏联和世界人民的民主力量，来捣乱东方和西方的和平。”（见八月十三日新华社社论）而在各种色彩的破坏分子里面，还特别看中了所谓“民主的个人主义”分子；试看艾奇逊很得意而又象很有把握的说：“中国的悠久文明和民主的个人主义终将再度胜利，中国终将推翻外来制度。”
    侵略，失败；失败了，继续侵略，结果怎样呢？事物发展的逻辑必然是：再失败。侵略，挨打；挨打了，继续侵略，结果怎样呢？事物发展的逻辑，必然是：再挨打。这就是全篇供状的要点。
    与世界劳苦人民大众和中国劳苦人民大众为敌，与代表世界劳苦人民大众利益的苏联和代表中国劳苦人民大众利益的共产党为敌，一句话：反苏、反共、反人民。与世界少数大地主大资产阶级和中国少数大地主大资产阶级为友，与代表世界少数大地主大资产阶级利益的一切反动派和代表中国少数大地主大资产阶级利益的国民党反动派为友，援助它们把它们团结在“美国世纪”的周围，结成反苏、反共、反人民的统一战线，并以它来对抗乃至企图消灭以苏联为首的反帝国主义的民主和平统一战线，这就是全篇供状的实质。
    谢谢美帝国主义，我们中国过去对美帝国主义曾经有过幻想的人们，也就是说，过去曾经接受过美帝国主义及其在中国的走狗国民党反动派宣传欺骗的人们，都从这篇可爱的坦白的供状中，获取了如下几点清楚明白的最可宝贵的教训：
    （一）美帝国主义（不是美国人民）与中国劳苦人民大众，和代表中国劳苦人民大众利益的共产党，及一切民主党派，是势不两立的。如果美国政府一日不放弃它的帝国主义政策，中国人民，中国共产党及一切民主党派，就与它绝无调和的余地。就绝不能希望它会和人民的中国讲平等讲互利。
    （二）代表少数大地主大资产阶级利益的美帝国主义集团与代表世界劳苦人民大众利益的苏联及东南欧各新民主国家也是势不两立的。如果美国政府一日不放弃它的帝国主义政策，苏联、东南欧各新民主国家，乃至世界劳苦人民大众，包括美国劳苦人民大众在内，也是与它绝无调和的余地的。也绝不能希望它会和苏联、东南欧各新民主国家，及一切劳苦人民大众讲平等、讲互利，以至于暂时和平相处。
    （三）要它暂时和永久放弃帝国主义政策，只有准备同它斗争，把人民革命战争进行到底，揭露帝国主义的本质，消灭它在中国的走狗蒋介石匪帮的残余势力，并镇压各种色彩的破坏分子，“只许他们规规矩矩，不许他们乱说乱动”，（毛泽东语）怕刺激它不行，哀求它更不行。
    （四）要使我们同帝国主义的斗争走向胜利，使它最后放弃帝国主义政策，只有加紧动员，“唤起民众及联合世界上以平等待我之民族，共同奋斗。”（孙中山语）尤其是要加强巩固、拥护代表世界劳苦人民大众利益的世界民主和平的堡垒——苏联。站在苏联的一边，站在反帝国主义的民主和平统一战线的一边，站在真理的一边，站在世界劳苦人民大众的一边。也就是说，只有遵循着中国共产党和中国人民领袖毛主席的指示：“一边倒”。“一边倒，是孙中山先生的四十年经验和共产党的二十八年经验教给我们的。深知欲达到胜利和巩固胜利，必须一边倒。”一边倒，也可以说，是美帝国主义长达一千零五十四页的白皮书教给我们的，深知欲使我们同帝国主义的斗争走向胜利，使它最后放弃帝国主义政策，必须一边倒。
    以上几点清楚明白最可宝贵的教训，的确是这篇“无可奈何的供状”—白皮书教给我们的。仅就这一点来说，这篇供状也的确显得坦白而又可爱。然而我们一定要特别注意：任何强盗，尤其是帝国主义强盗，当它在世界劳苦人民大众，尤其是在中国劳苦人民大众的重刑拷打之下，固然不能不把它某些强盗行为，老实供出来；但帝国主义强盗总是惯于而且善于把它的一切强盗行为，放在某些冠冕堂皇的，好看的，好听的，曾经对于某些人们有过癖爱而今还固执着的那些东西的隐蔽之下。美帝国主义蒙在它那一千零五十四页长的白皮书的外皮是什么呢？就是，艾奇逊说的“中国的悠久文明和民主的个人主义终将再度胜利，中国终将推翻外来制度。”他好象说：美帝国主义不是在干涉、侵略中国，而是要在保卫中国的悠久文明和民主的个人主义，并且帮助中国推翻外来制度。
    中国的悠久文明，对于某些中国人的确是有过癖爱而今还固执着的。民主的个人主义，亦即旧民主主义，英美式的民主主义，对于某些中国人的确也是有过癖爱而今还固执着的。反对并坚拒外来制度，更可以说是一般民族性的表现，中国民族也不能例外。
    然而美帝国主义，是否真的要来保卫中国的悠久文明和民主的个人主义，并来帮助中国推翻外来制度呢？我们从它那无可奈何的长篇供状中，既然揭穿了它一切强盗行为的实质，还必须撕掉它那蒙在一切盗强行为之上的好看的冠冕堂皇的外皮。
    我们先来剖解一下它所谓“民主的个人主义”是什么？如前所说，这就是旧民主，英美式的民主，尤其是有着华盛顿、嘉斐孙、林肯传统的美国式的民主。这在当时的确是有它的进步性与革命性的。但在今天的美国，已被所谓杜鲁门主义、马歇尔主义、艾奇逊主义扼杀了。杜、马、艾口中的民主主义，是以反苏、反共、反人民、拥护少数大地主大资产阶级利益为必须和起码条件的民主主义。你要是一个民主的个人主义分子，你就必须反苏、反共、反人民，拥护华尔街少数独占资本家的利益。否则你就是共产党，你就要受非美调查委员会的检举，你就不能享有任何旧民主主义所给与的应有的丝毫权利。旧民主主义已被美帝国主义扼杀了，但是它还要在世界人民面前、中国人民面前，叫卖旧民主主义的遗爱，而把它的反苏、反共、反人民的一切强盗行为说成是保卫世界民主的义举。因此，它所谓中国的悠久文明和民主的个人主义终必再度胜利，也就是说中国的反动分子、反苏、反共、反人民的分子，终必再度胜利。中国的“民主的个人主义”分子，如果要受到美帝国主义的赏识，你就必须要变成反苏、反共、反人民、拥护中国少数大地主大资产阶级的利益的分子。因此，美帝国主义口中的民主个人主义，不过是掩盖它反苏、反共、反人民的一切强盗行为的外皮，我们必须撕碎它。
    再则我们来解剖一下它所谓“外来制度”及其所要“推翻”的“外来制度”是什么？这指的就是马克思主义、列宁主义，由马列主义的思想体系所产生的社会制度，和当前中国共产党所领导的人民民主专政制度。揭穿了说就是一切从苏联来的制度。美帝国主义认为必须推翻它，因为这是“为外国为苏联的利益效劳”的制度。美帝国主义为要推翻这种外来制度，就与“过去军阀并无区别的反动分子”“已经失去人民的支持”的国民党反动派，打成一片。支持它、帮助它来全心全意的执行帝国主义殖民地化中国的政策，这才不是为外国人的利益效劳，这种制度虽然也是外来的，揭穿了说因为它是从美国来的，才必须保持，不可推翻，所以美帝国主义所叫卖的“推翻外来制度”，也只是掩蔽美帝国主义干涉、侵略中国一切强盗行为的外皮，我们必须撕毁它。
    因此，所有一切冠冕堂皇的、好看的、好听的，曾经对于某些人们有过癖爱而今还固执着的东西，一经过帝国主义强盗之口说出来，我们就必须另外加以解释，加以翻译。因此，我们必须把资本主义初期有着华盛顿、嘉斐荪、林肯传统的民主主义，亦即旧民主主义和帝国主义时代经过杜鲁门、马歇尔、艾奇逊改换了内容歪曲了意义的，特别要在中国叫卖的民主个人主义，区别出来。前者是有过它的进步性与革命性的，后者只是反苏、反共、反人民的幌子，是彻底反动的、反革命的。我们必须把从苏联来的外来制度，与从美国来的外来制度区别出来，前者是符合世界无产阶级及一切劳苦人民大众利益的马列主义的思想体系，是由马列主义的思想体系所产生的符合世界无产阶级及一切劳苦人民大众利益的社会制度；这种制度正在苏联、中国、东南欧建立并日益巩固起来，它也要在全世界，在美国建立起来，决不可能把它推翻；后者是符合世界大地主大资产阶级利益的帝国主义的思想体系，由帝国主义思想体系所产生的殖民地化中国的社会制度，这才需要推翻，中国人民也必然推翻它。我们把这些都辨别清楚了，我们就不怕帝国主义歪曲、诬蔑，但帝国主义的歪曲、诬蔑是无所不用其极的。美帝国主义所发表的白皮书的第二章，恶意的歪曲了孙中山先生与中国共产党的合作；恶意的抹杀了孙先生的进步主张，例如联苏政策，联共政策，扶助工农政策，反对帝国主义，反对资产阶级专政，耕者有其田的主张等等，同时还恶意的诬蔑孙先生曾反对阶级斗争，从而也反对过从苏联来的外来制度。当然我们也决不否认孙先生为一定时期的历史背景，社会条件所限制，在其过去的思想意识中有着守旧部分。然而我们对于一个历史人物的评价，必然要以其最后言行作为定论。孙先生于临死前致苏联的遗书，沉痛而又严肃诚恳的写道：“我在此患不治之症，我的心念，此时转向于你们，转向于我党及我国之将来，你们是自由的共和国大联合之首领，此自由的共和国大联合，是不朽的列宁遗与被压迫民族的世界之真遗产，帝国主义的难民，将借此以保卫其自由，从以古代奴役战争偏私为基础之国际制度中谋解放。我遗下的是国民党，我希望国民党在完成其由帝国主义制度解放中国及其他被侵略国之历史工作中，与你们合力共作。命运使我须放下未竟之业，移交与彼谨守国民党主义教训而组织我真正同志之人，故遗嘱国民党进行民族革命运动之工作，俾中国可免帝国主义加诸中国的半殖民地状况之羁缚，为达此目的，我已命国民党长此继续与你们提携，我深信你们政府亦必继续前此予我们之援助。亲爱的同志，当此与你们诀别之际，我愿表示我热烈的希望，希望不久即将破晓，斯时苏联以良友及盟国而欢迎强盛独立之中国，两国在争世界被压迫民族自由之大战中，携手并进以取得胜利。谨以兄弟之谊祝你们平安！”
    以上是孙先生致苏联遗书全文。愚笨的杜鲁门、艾奇逊老爷们，你们如果能有幸运读到这篇遗书，就知道伟大的孙先生是如何真诚的，对于根据马列主义阶级斗争学说获致十月革命伟大胜利而树立起来的代表世界无产阶级及一切劳苦人民大众利益的社会主义国家——苏联，表示衷心的同情啊！他反对阶级斗争吗？须知马列主义的阶级斗争学说，并不是在保持阶级及阶级斗争，恰恰相反，而是要最后消灭阶级及阶级斗争，也就是要最后消灭压迫、剥削制度，所以孙先生认为社会主义国家苏联：“是不朽的列宁遗与被压迫民族的真遗产”，这份遗产对于被压迫剥削的“帝国主义的难民，将借此以保卫其自由”，所以他“希望国民党在完成其由帝国主义制度解放中国及其他被侵略国之历史工作中”，要与苏联“合力共作”，希望中国与苏联“两国在争世界被压迫民族自由之大战中，携手并进以取得胜利”。因此，他直呼苏联人民为“亲爱的同志”，于临死前，还要“谨以兄弟之谊”，祝苏联人民的平安，而且他预言的表示了他热烈的希望，希望不久即将破晓，“斯时苏联以良友及盟国而欢迎强盛独立之中国”，现在已真正破晓了，历史发展的规律，不折不扣的证实了他的预言之准确。要说这就是外来制度吧！这种符合于全世界人民利益，也符合于全中国人民利益的外来制度，是孙先生所早就衷心欢迎而欲见诸实行的。要说这就是一边倒吧！孙先生也早就“一边倒”了。
    正因为孙先生衷心的欢迎从苏联来的符合于一切人民大众利益的外来制度，他就必然要反对并且要推翻从美帝国来的压迫剥削人民大众的外来制度。正因为孙先生早就一边倒了，倒在社会主义国家苏联一边了，所以他就必然要反对帝国主义，咬牙切齿的痛恨帝国主义，所以他要“遗嘱国民党进行民族革命运动之工作，俾可免帝国主义加诸中国半殖民地之羁缚”。愚笨的杜鲁门、艾奇逊老爷们，想抹杀改造历史，把孙先生也当着“民主个人主义”的拥护者，争取到他们那边去，这只能是又一次的徒劳，而且是又一次对于孙先生历史评价最严重的诬蔑。
    我们除了在这一点上，要对于白皮书的歪曲诬蔑，加以严正的驳斥外，本会同人，亦即孙先生所谓“谨守国民党主义教训而组织我真正的同志之人，必然要恪守孙先生的遗教，联合苏联，贯彻中国民族、民主革命到底，从根消灭美帝国主义及其在中国的走狗蒋介石集团的一切残余势力，并粉碎美帝国主义继续征募各种色彩的破坏分子来捣乱中国，捣乱苏联及世界民主力量，捣乱东方和西方和平的阴谋。同时，还要在中国共产党和中国人民领袖毛主席的领导之下，展开白皮书的研究讨论，澄清一些素来对于中美关系、中苏关系、国共关系等等不正确的了解，决定各民主党派，各人民团体及各界民主人士在反帝国主义的斗争中，应取的态度，尤其是要把美帝国主义所谓“民主个人主义”分子尽可能的争取过来，使美帝国主义今后任何新的阴谋诡计，无所施其技。这样，白皮书，就不仅是一篇“无可奈何的供状”。同时，也是一本对于中国某些思想糊涂的人们的很好的教育书了。
