　　Application for Travel Permits
　　Beijing Sets New Procedures
　　[This Municipality News] The Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau recently announced that the travel permits required for travel between this city and the North China liberated areas will be abolished starting from the 29th of this month. At the same time, the bureau also announced new procedures for applying for travel permits for those traveling to the Central China, East China, Northwest China, Northeast China liberated areas, and other areas awaiting liberation. The procedures stipulate that personnel from government organs, schools, and organizations applying for travel permits must submit a letter of introduction and other supporting documents directly to the local Public Security Sub-bureau. Ordinary citizens must first fill out an application form at the local police station, present their household registration and other documents, and then obtain the permit from the Public Security Sub-bureau.
