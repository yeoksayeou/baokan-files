A History of American Aggression Against China
Liu Danian

　　II. Gradually Moving Towards Independent Aggression Against China (Continued VIII)

After serving as the Consul in Fengtian for two years, Studer, after the New Railway Law failed, repeatedly contacted Xu Shichang, the Governor-General of the Three Eastern Provinces, and Tang Shaoyi to develop Manchuria with American capital. In September 1908, Studer returned to the United States, carrying with him a draft contract for American investment concluded with the authorities of the Three Eastern Provinces. After Studer returned to the United States, he was appointed Acting Director of the Far Eastern Department of the State Department, which indirectly prompted the Qing government, through Tang Shaoyi, to thank the U.S. government for returning the Boxer Indemnity that year, and to go to the United States for further negotiations. Not long after Tang Shaoyi arrived in the United States, the last authoritative figures of the dark rule of the Manchu Qing Dynasty—Nara (Empress Dowager Cixi) and Zai Tian (Emperor Guangxu)—suddenly died at the same time. This was another major blow to the American plan, because the United States was indirectly targeting Cabinet Minister Yuan Shikai in this activity, and Tang Shaoyi's visit to the United States was directly recommended by Yuan. After Nara's death, Empress Longyu (Zai Tian's wife) was very dissatisfied with Yuan Shikai because Yuan had betrayed Zai Tian during the Hundred Days' Reform. In January 1909 (the first year of Xuantong), Yuan was forced to resign, and the loan negotiations had to be suspended again. This was the third failure of the United States to seize the Three Eastern Provinces.

As mentioned above, the United States had previously returned a portion of the Boxer Indemnity (i.e., the reward obtained by the United States for suppressing the Boxer Rebellion). This was done by the United States to strengthen its foundation for independent operations in China. It needed to cultivate a group of Chinese "talents" who would faithfully serve the American aggression and to broadly buy the hearts of the Chinese people. Returning a portion of the indemnity and stipulating that it be used for education could achieve both of these goals. It was a triumphant "double-edged sword" for the American aggressors, and certainly not out of any "friendship" for the Chinese people. By 1923, when various countries were vying to "return" the Boxer Indemnity and learn from the United States, the American Millard's Review revealed this "heavenly secret." (Note: The Oriental Magazine, Vol. 12, No. 5, translated Millard's Review's comments on the return of the Boxer Indemnity by various countries: "Recently, almost every week, a country announces its intention to return the Boxer Indemnity... Judging from this, it can be seen that all future aggression against China will take the form of education. Various countries are competing to educate young Chinese men and women... If Roosevelt were still alive, how gratified would he be to see that the plan to return funds for education, which he initiated, and which was criticized by those who regarded it as aggression against China a few years ago, is now actually unanimously approved by all participating countries.")

From 1905 to 1908, relations between the United States and Japan were tense, and the U.S. Atlantic Fleet "visited" Japan, and rumors of a U.S.-Japan war spread for a time. But at this time, the United States' activities in China could not completely break away from Japan, and Japan was not in favor of a falling out with the United States. At the end of November 1908 (the 34th year of Guangxu), the two countries reached an agreement through an "exchange of notes," the Root-Takahira Agreement, which showed mutual understanding in the aggression against China. On the surface, it declared:

"The policy of the two governments does not contain any aggressive tendencies... and they are determined to maintain the independence and territorial integrity of China, and the principle of equal opportunity for the industries and commerce of all powers in that country, within the limits of their authority, by all peaceful means, in order to protect the common interests of the powers in that country..."

Such obscure and circuitous diplomatic language must be read in reverse. Translated into ordinary language, the meaning is very simple: the United States and Japan may engage in any acts of aggression against China, but they must reduce friction between them in order to maintain the common interests of exploiting the Chinese people. As for the sacrifice of the Chinese people, that need not be considered. This kind of agreement naturally had no meaning in restraining the aggression of both sides against China, but was merely a product of the transitional period when the United States was gradually independently aggressing against China.

At the same time that Studer and Tang Shaoyi were conducting negotiations and the U.S. and Japan were conducting "exchange of notes" negotiations, American aggressors were drafting another plan to attack the Three Eastern Provinces. At this time, there was news that Russia was selling the Chinese Eastern Railway, which revived the United States' ambition to buy the South Manchurian Railway. They believed that if they bought the Chinese Eastern Railway, they could pressure Japan to sell the South Manchurian Railway. Obtaining these two railways was the most ideal undertaking for the American aggressors since the Russo-Japanese War. Jacob H. Schiff, manager of Harriman's company, Kuhn, Loeb & Co., asked the Japanese authorities whether Japan was willing to renegotiate the sale of the South Manchurian Railway if the United States was prepared to buy the Chinese Eastern Railway. In January 1909, Schiff received a reply from Takahashi, the president of the Yokohama Specie Bank: "Japan has no intention of selling the South Manchurian Railway, and please do not engage in such activities in the future." Negotiations with Tang Shaoyi had also stopped at this time, so the United States simply organized a large-scale consortium to compete with Japan and other powers in China. The consortium included the largest American financial organizations such as J.P. Morgan & Co., Kuhn, Loeb & Co., First National Bank, and Citibank, and sent Studer to China again as its representative to conduct large-scale investment negotiations. President William H. Taft and Secretary of State Knox used various diplomatic means to promote this plan.

At this time, the Manchu Qing government was no longer optimistic about the situation in the Three Eastern Provinces, and felt that "the Eastern Province is located between two strong powers, and the situation is pressing, like a pile of firewood under a house, with deep hidden dangers." Therefore, their traitorous policy was: "To open up commercial ports widely to allow foreigners to collect, to secretly prevent monopolies, to accumulate foreign debts in order to allow foreign funds to flow inward, and to secretly use this as a restraining measure." (Note: Archives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Telegram from Xi Liang, Governor-General of the Three Eastern Provinces, and Cheng Dequan, Governor of Fengtian, to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, recorded in Wang Yunsheng's Former Writings, Vol. 5, pp. 292-293.) Xiong Xiling, the Financial Supervisor of the Three Eastern Provinces, even advocated turning the Northeast into the Balkans of the time and submitting it to a conference of the powers. (Note: Xiong Xiling's memorial to Zai Ze, the Minister of the Ministry of Revenue, Drafts of Mr. Xiong Bing San.) As soon as Studer arrived in Beijing, he seized the opportunity and quickly agreed on a plan with the Qing government to build a railway from Jinzhou to Aigun with American capital in conjunction with the British Pauling & Company. In October 1909, Xi Liang, the Governor-General of the Three Eastern Provinces, and Cheng Dequan, the Governor of Fengtian, signed a draft loan contract for the "Aigun-Jinzhou Railway" with Studer. Article 6 stipulated: "This company shall be formed by people from China, the United States, and Britain" (Note: Archives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, recorded in Wang's Previous Writings, Vol. 5, pp. 293-296), completely disregarding Chinese sovereignty. However, it was again opposed by Japan and Russia, and some people within the Qing government also came out to criticize this contract as "being condemned by the world," and said that the Three Eastern Provinces were the birthplace of the Qing government and should not be sold (Note: Archives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Memorial from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Posts and Communications regarding the loan for building railways in the Three Eastern Provinces, recorded in Wang's Previous Writings, pp. 299-301). The Aigun-Jinzhou Railway issue was delayed for a time.

The United States had repeatedly hoped that Japan would sell the South Manchurian Railway, basically using Japan's strength, but it had been unsuccessful several times. Thus, while the Aigun-Jinzhou Railway had not yet been finalized, Knox proposed a more vicious plan for the international management of the Manchurian Railway—the so-called Knox Plan—and reversed its past methods, completely abandoning Japan and adopting a policy of cooperation with Britain. In November 1909, the U.S. State Department instructed Reid, the U.S. Ambassador to London, to ask the British government to "approve" the U.S. plan. In December, Fei Lici, the U.S. Chargé d'Affaires in Beijing, sent a note to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Qing government, saying that if China wished to preserve the sovereignty of the three provinces, it must first unify the railway affairs there. "This method must recognize China as the landlord and allow several countries to prepare the necessary funds." (Note: Archives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, recorded in the Previous Writings, p. 311.)

The true intention of Knox's plan was not simply to change the ownership of the railways in the Three Eastern Provinces from Japan and Russia to a greater number of aggressors. It was to use this method to completely seize the Three Eastern Provinces for itself! When Fei Lici urged the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to quickly finalize the Aigun-Jinzhou Railway issue, he said: "The U.S. government attaches great importance to this matter, believing that the future method of unifying railways is of the utmost importance. If the Aigun-Jinzhou Railway is completed, then according to this contract, this company can be allowed to come forward, gather the funds of various countries, and build roads everywhere" (Note: Archives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Secret Letter from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the Ministry of Revenue and the Ministry of Posts and Communications, the second day of the twelfth month of the first year of Xuantong, recorded in the Previous Writings, p. 315). The "company" mentioned here refers to the American Aigun-Jinzhou Railway Company, which had no Chinese sovereignty and in which Britain only held a secondary position, as stated in the aforementioned contract. If the United States succeeded in "gathering the funds of various countries and building roads everywhere," it would undoubtedly "unify" the affairs of the Three Eastern Provinces under the control of the American aggressors. Therefore, Knox's "internationalization" or "neutralization" of the Manchurian Railway was actually a euphemism for Americanization.

　　美国侵华史
    刘大年
  　二　逐渐走向独立侵略中国　（续八）
    司戴德任奉天领事二年，新法铁路不成后，他又与东三省总督徐世昌及唐绍仪屡次接洽，以美国资本开发满洲。一九○八年九月司戴德回国，携带有与东三省当局订立的美国投资草合同一件。司回国后，被任为国务院代理远东司长，转使清政府方面由唐绍仪以致谢美国政府于是年退还庚子赔款为名，往美国作进一步接洽。唐绍仪抵美不久，满清朝廷黑暗统治的最后权威者——那拉氏（西太后）和载＠（光绪帝）突然同时死去，这对美国的计划又是个不小打击，因为美国这次活动是间接以内阁大臣袁世凯为对手，唐绍仪赴美尤为袁所直接推荐，那拉氏死后，隆裕后（载＠妻）以袁世凯在戊戌变法时曾出卖载＠，对袁世凯很不满，一九○九年（宣统元年）一月，袁被迫辞职，借款交涉又不得不中止。这是美国夺取东三省第三次失败。
    上面已提到的美国在此以前曾退还庚子赔款（即美国镇压义和团连动所得报酬）一部，是美国为了加强它在中国独立作战的基础，既要培养一批为美国侵略事业忠实服务的中国“人材”，又须广泛收买中国人心，退还一部庚款，并规定用于教育事业，正可以收到这两方面的效果：是美国侵略者“一箭双雕”的得意之作，绝非它对中国人民有何“友谊”，到一九二三年，各国争着“退还”庚子赔款，向美国学习的时候，美国密勒氏评论报曾把这一点“天机”泄漏出来。（注：东方杂志十二卷五号，译密勒氏评论报对各国退还庚子赔款评论有：“近来每一星期中几必有一国宣布其欲退还拳乱赔款，……综此以观，可知以后一切对华侵略皆将以教育形式出之，各国皆以教育中国青年男女为竞争………假令罗斯福而犹生存者，见彼所发起之退款兴学计划数年前犹为侵略中国者非难，今实际上已为参加各国一致赞同，则其欣慰为何如乎。”）
    从一九○五年到一九○八年期间，美日两国的关系一直很紧张，美国大西洋舰队曾“访问”日本，美日战争风声传播一时。但美国此时在中国的活动究竟还不能完全脱离日本，日本也不利于与美国失和，一九○八年（光绪三十四年）十一月底，两国以“换文”方式成立一个在对中国侵略中互相谅解的罗脱高平协定，表面上宣称：
    “两国政府之政策，不含任何侵略的倾向……并决意依其权限内之一切和平手段维持中国之独立及领土完整，及该国内列强工商业之机会均等主义，以保列强在该国之共同利益……”
    这类隐蔽曲折的外交词令，是要从反面去读的，译成普通语言，意思很简单：美日两国对中国不妨有任何侵略行为，但须减少双方磨擦，才能维持榨取中国人民的共同利益，至于中国人民的被牺牲，那是不必顾虑的。此种协定，自然没有任何约束双方对华侵略的意义，只是美国逐渐独立侵略中国这个过渡时期应有的产物。
    就在司戴德与唐绍仪进行交涉及美日“换文”谈判的同时，美国侵略者们正起草着另外一个进攻东三省的计划。这时俄国有出售中东路消息，使美国收买南满路野心复活，他们以为买得中东路，便可压迫日本出售南满路，取得这两条铁路，是美国侵略者在日俄战争以来最理想的事业，哈利满的公司——坤洛公司经理斯奇夫（Ｊａｃｏｂ．Ｈ．Ｓｃｈｉｆｆ）问日本当局，说美国准备收买中东路，日本是否愿意重新谈判出售南满路问题？一九○九年一月斯奇夫得到日本正金银行总裁高桥的答复：“日本无出售南满路之意，并请将来亦勿作此类活动。”与唐绍仪的谈判这时也已停止，美国遂干脆组织一个大规模财团，来与日本及其他强国在中国竞争，财团包括美国最大的金融组织摩根公司、坤洛公司、第一国家银行、花旗银行等，以司戴德为代表重赴中国，进行大举投资交涉，总统塔虎脱（Ｗｉｌｌｉａｍ．Ｈ．Ｔａｆｔ）与国务卿诺克斯（Ｋｎｏｘ）更以种种外交手段推行这个计划。
    满清政府此时对东三省情势已不敢乐观，觉得“东省介居两强，势成逼处，积薪厝火，隐患日深”。因此他们的卖国政策是：“广开商埠俾外人搜集，隐杜垄断之谋，厚集洋债俾外款内输，阴作牵制之计。”（注：外交部档案，东三省总督锡良奉天巡抚程德全致外务部电，载王芸生前书，五卷，二九二——二九三页。）东三省财政监理官熊希龄更主张把东北变成当时的巴尔干半岛，付之列国会议。（注：熊希龄上度支部尚书载泽条陈，熊秉三先生存稿。）司戴德一到北京就乘机而入，很快与清政府商定了一个方案，由美国资本结合英国保龄公司建筑从锦州到瑷珲的铁路。一九○九年十月东三省总督锡良，奉天巡抚程德全与司戴德签订一个“瑷锦路”借款草合同，第六条中规定：“该公司应由中美英三国之人联络而成”（注：外交部档案，载王前书，五卷，二九三——二九六页），完全置中国主权于不问。但又遭日俄两国反对，清政府内部也出来一部分人指责这个合同“为举世诟病”，且说东三省为清政府发祥之地，不宜出卖（注：外交部档案，外度邮三部为东三省借款筑路事奏摺，载王前书，二九九——三○一页。）锦瑷路问题便一时迁延不决。
    美国几次希望日本出售南满路，基本上还是利用日本的力量，但几次都不成功，如是在锦瑷路还没有定局时，诺克斯提出一个更加毒辣的国际共管满洲铁路的计划——所谓诺克斯计划（Ｋｎｏｘ　Ｐｌａｎ），并一反过去手段，完全抛开日本，采取与英国合作的方针。一九○九年十一月，美国务院训令驻伦敦美国大使李德（Ｒｅｉｄ）要他请英政府对美国的计划予以“嘉纳”，又于十二月由驻北京美国代办费莱齐送一个节略给清政府外务部，说中国如果愿保存三省主权，便须先把那里铁路事权统归一律，“此等办法须认中国为地主，亦当允数国备办需用之款。”（注：外交部档案，载前书，三一一页。）
    诺克斯这个计划的真实用意，并不是简单的要把东三省铁路由日俄两国所有，变为更多数的侵略者所有，它是想用此办法把东三省完全抓到自己手里！在费莱齐催促外务部迅速确定锦瑷路问题时说：“美政府重视此事，以为将来统并铁路之办法，有最切要之关系，若锦瑷之局既成，则按此约，可令该公司出头，集各国之资，而筑各处之路”（注：外务部档案，宣统元年十二月初二日，外务部致度支邮传部秘函，载前书，三一五页），这里所谓“该公司”，是指前述合同所载中国没有主权，英国仅占次要地位的美国锦瑷路公司，如果做到了由美国来“集各国之资，筑各处之路”，自是不折不扣将东三省的事权“统归”到美国侵略者手中去了，所以诺克斯的满洲铁路“国际化”或“中立化”，实际上是美国化的代名词。
