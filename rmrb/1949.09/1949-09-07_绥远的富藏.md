　　Suiyuan's Rich Resources

    Before arriving in Suiyuan, based on past incorrect understanding, I imagined Suiyuan to be mostly a barren desert, a desolate place; but since arriving in Suiyuan, my impression is quite different.

    Suiyuan is a very important area in North China. It is a well-known grain-producing area in North China. More than half of the food for the Tianjin and Beijing areas depends on Suiyuan. In the past, it has exported more than 2.4 million dan of grain in a year. Suiyuan has the water conservancy of the Hetao area, vast fertile land, and large areas of uncultivated land. If it can use modern methods to produce more food to supply the needs of Tianjin and Beijing, it can greatly reduce the grain burden on Hebei and the Northeast. Then Hebei can grow more cotton, and the Northeast can use more food to exchange for machinery, gasoline, etc., which will greatly help the industrial construction of Tianjin and Beijing and the Northeast.

    Suiyuan also has a large number of export goods such as flaxseed, pig bristles, eggs, and cashmere. Flaxseed accounts for about 10 to 15 percent of the planting area. A dozen dan of flaxseed can be exchanged for a tractor. The quality and quantity of pig bristles are second only to the Northeast. Six-inch bristles can be exchanged for more than two bolts of native cloth per catty. Tianjin exports are worth more than 800 taels of gold per set (more than 4,500 catties). Eggs are both large and numerous. The Yixingcheng Egg Factory in Fengzhen processes 120,000 eggs every day. Tianjin Trading Company once ordered 216 tons of egg products. Two hundred eggs can be exchanged for a bolt of native cloth. Two catties of white cashmere can be exchanged for a bolt of native cloth, and three catties of black cashmere can be exchanged for a bolt of native cloth. Other products such as leather have an annual output of more than 5 million pieces, and livestock exports are about 100,000 heads per year.

    The mineral deposits are also very rich. The coal reserves in the Yikezhao League are about 420 million tons. If the coal and iron ore deposits in Anbei and Baotou are exploited, they will be no less than the Ruhr area of Germany. Then Baotou can be developed into a city with a population of 4 million. The Japanese invaders had built a railway to Shiguaizi and carried out preliminary mining. Other products such as mica, asbestos, lead powder, graphite, and natural alkali are indispensable raw materials for industry. Baotou is rich in ＠＠, which is the best raw material for papermaking. If a large-scale paper mill can be established, it can supply the entire North China.

    Suiyuan has only been developed for more than 300 years. Although it has an area of more than 340,000 square kilometers, it only has a population of 2 million, with less than six people per square kilometer. Furthermore, because in the past the general public did not have enough understanding of Suiyuan, coupled with the cruel rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, cultural construction was very backward and the rich resources could not be developed. Now Suiyuan will be completely liberated, and everything will forever belong to the people. The construction of a new Suiyuan has a bright and great future. It is hoped that revolutionary youths who are determined to serve the border areas can actively come to Suiyuan and strive for the glorious cause of building a new Suiyuan and a new China!

　　绥远的富藏
  　本报绥远通讯
    愿志军
    在未到绥远以前，根据过去不正确的认识，想象绥远多半是沙漠不毛之地，一片荒凉；但自到绥远后，给我的印象却大不然。
    绥远在华北是一个很重要的地区，它是华北有名的产粮区，平津一带二分之一以上的食粮仰给于绥远，过去一年之内曾输出过二百四十万大石的粮食。绥远有河套等处的水利，有广漠肥沃的及大片未开垦的土地，如果能用现代化的方式，生产更多的食粮供给平津等地的需要，大可减少河北、东北等地对平津的粮食负担，则河北可多种棉花，东北可多用食粮对外交换机器汽油等，对平津东北工业的建设帮助很大。
    绥远还有大量的胡麻、猪鬃、鸡蛋、羊绒等出口品。胡麻约占种植面积的百分之十至十五，十几石胡麻即可交换拖拉机一架；猪鬃的质与量仅次于东北，六英寸鬃每斤可换土布二匹多，天津出口每套（四千五百多斤）值黄金八百多两；鸡蛋既大又多，丰镇的义兴诚蛋厂每天便要打十二万颗，天津贸易公司一次定购了蛋品二百十六吨，二百个鸡蛋即可换土布一匹；白色羊绒二斤可换土布一匹，黑色羊绒三斤可换土布一匹；其他如皮革年产在五百万张以上，牲畜每年输出约十余万头。
    矿产的蕴藏也甚丰富，伊克昭盟的煤藏约四万万二千万吨。安北、包头一带煤铁矿藏如开采后，不下于德国的鲁尔区，则包头可发展为四百万人口之都市，日寇并向石拐子修有铁路初步进行过开采。其他如云母、石棉、铅粉、石墨、天然碱等出产，均为工业上不可缺少的原料。包头盛产＠＠，为造纸之最好原料，如能设大规模造纸厂，可供全华北之用。
    绥远因开化仅三百多年，虽有三十四万多平方公里的面积，但却只有二百万人口，每平方公里尚不到六个人，再因过去一般人对绥远认识不够，加以国民党反动派的残酷统治，所以文化建设均甚落后，富藏未能开展。现绥远将全部解放，一切永远为人民所有，建设新的绥远有光明伟大的远景，希望有志服务边疆的革命青年，能踊跃到绥远来，为建设新绥远新中国的光荣事业而奋斗！
