Xinhua News Agency, Central China Front, 14th. After entering the Xiangjiang area, the People's Liberation Army immediately helped the people with the autumn harvest, quickly establishing close relations with the local people. After the political department of a certain unit issued instructions to various units to use the gaps in combat to help the people with harvesting, all units immediately responded in unison. Commanders and fighters, disregarding fatigue, helped the people cut wheat under the scorching sun. Many people's clothes were soaked with sweat, but they were unwilling to rest. Some units launched a competition campaign during the harvest. Some soldiers explained the victorious situation of the current Liberation War to the villagers while cutting rice. Many elderly farmers said with emotion: "Twenty years ago, the Red Army fought for us and also helped us cut rice. You are exactly the same as the Red Army." When a certain unit of the PLA was ordered to continue advancing south, the men, women, old, and young of a certain village were reluctant to part, as if they were parting with relatives. They saw them off for several miles and also gave the PLA two silk banners to express their gratitude to their own army.

　　湘赣我军冒烈日酷暑
  　帮助人民秋收
    【新华社华中前线十四日电】人民解放军进入湘赣地区，即帮助人民秋收，迅速地和当地人民建立了亲密的关系。某部政治部号召各部利用作战空隙时间帮助人民收割的指示发出后，各部立即一致响应。指挥员战斗员们在烈日酷暑下不顾疲劳帮助人民割麦。许多人衣服被汗水湿透了也不肯休息。有些部队在收割中掀起了竞赛运动。有些战士一边割稻一边给老乡们讲解目前解放战争的胜利形势。许多年老的农民都感动地说：“二十年前，红军为我们打仗，还帮我们割稻子，你们和红军真是一模一样。”当某部解放军奉命继续南进时，某村男女老少都象离别亲人一样依依不舍，他们一直欢送了几里路远，还送了锦旗两面给解放军，表示他们对于自己的军队的感谢。
