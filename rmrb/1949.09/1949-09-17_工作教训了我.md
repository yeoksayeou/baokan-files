　　Work Has Taught Me
　　Zhī Shān
　　Filled with enthusiasm, I entered the army; after a short period of study, I was assigned to be a cultural instructor in a company. Indeed, at the time, I felt infinitely excited: I could do some things for the soldiers, I could absorb the soldiers' language, I could enrich my own life experience, I could...
　　However, for half a year, the facts proved that everything was not as easy as imagined. I became depressed for a short period, and finally, after a calm review, I discovered the crux of the problem:
　　I thought I was here to do cultural work, and as long as I did the cultural work well, everything else would be fine, and I could ignore everything else. So I didn't go to morning exercises, thinking it wasn't serving the soldiers, so why go? I didn't listen to the cadres' political lessons, thinking I didn't come to listen to your lectures, and I understood what you were saying anyway (always forgetting that I was a college student), listening to you for two hours was not as beneficial as reading for two hours myself. After attending the class and platoon discussions once or twice, I felt there was nothing to listen to, so I stopped attending. In this way, I gradually created a special status for myself in the company. This was entirely due to my narrow understanding of the meaning of "work." I didn't realize that doing so would only separate me from the masses step by step. Not participating in discussions would prevent me from understanding the soldiers' ideological situation (soldiers' opinions in the discussions were mostly related to themselves), which greatly hindered my work and created an impression of being insincere and arrogant among the masses. In this way, how could it be possible to do a good job simply by talking about it?
　　Without considering the needs and level of the masses, I stubbornly forced my own ideas on them. For example, in cultural classes, when talking about what dialectical materialism is, I wrote on the blackboard: "Dialectical materialism is the philosophy of Marxism, a science about the most general laws of the development of nature, society, and human thought." Unquestioningly reciting from books, how could they listen? As a result, the number of people attending the class dropped sharply to one-third (and some were even dozing off), but at the time, I still blamed them for not being good enough.
　　Distrusting the masses: Expressing doubts about the power of the masses, I dared not let them do anything on their own. For example, when writing the blackboard newspaper, I had the soldiers write it themselves a few times, but I immediately felt that they didn't know how to write the headlines and their handwriting was sloppy, so I simply stopped letting them write it. I didn't think about how to patiently help them and humbly accept their opinions, eventually forming a situation of doing everything myself. Being too busy, I inevitably became perfunctory.
　　Not having a broad enough contact base: Only relying on my own pleasure, I only interacted with a very small number of soldiers with higher education levels (mostly those who had been liberated not long ago), while taking an indifferent attitude towards the vast majority of others, and even less could I talk about actively approaching them. In this way, I invisibly isolated myself. At the same time, for some soldiers with ideological problems (most of the newly liberated ones had very deep orthodox ideas), after arguing with them once or twice, I let them go. The above are just a few major examples. I felt that I had really let the soldiers down in the past six months, and at one point, I even lost the courage to work because of this. But the soldiers' same kindness and concern for me made me deeply aware of my mistakes and their magnanimity; as long as I can bravely correct myself and have the determination to transform myself, the soldiers will always welcome me.

　　工作教训了我
    之山
    满怀着热情，走入部队；经过短期学习后，被派充连队文化教员。的确，当时我是感到无限兴奋的：可以为兵多少做些事情，可以吸收兵的语言，可以丰富自己的生活经验，可以………
    可是，半年来，事实证明一切都并不如想象的那末容易，自己消沉了一个短期，终于在冷静的检讨下，我发现了症结所在：
    我以为自己是来干文化工作的，只要把文化工作干好，其他一切都没问题，都可以不理；于是早操也不去，认为这又不是为兵服务，去干啥？干部上政治课也不去听，认为我又不是为听你上课而来，并且你讲的我都懂（始终忘不掉自己是个大学生），听你讲两个钟头还不如自己看两个钟头书得益的多。班排开讨论会，参加了一两次后，觉得没啥听头，于是也就不再参加了。就这样，渐渐将自己造成连队中一位特殊地位的人物。这实是全由于我对“工作”之含义有着太狭隘的认识，没想到那样做只有和群众一步一步隔开，不参加讨论会就不会认识了解战士们的思想上情况（讨论会中战士发表意见大多联系到自己），使自己在工作上受到极大阻碍，在群众中造成不虚心，自高自大的印象。这样，凭空说干好工作，又那来可能？
    不顾及群众需要、程度，就把自己那一套硬往群众头上套，例如上文化课，讲到什么叫辩证唯物论时，就在黑板上写着：“辩证唯物论是马克思主义的哲学，是关于自然、社会、和人类思维发展最一般的法则的科学。”不折不扣地背诵书本，你叫他们怎能听得下去？于是听课人数骤减至三分之一（还有打瞌睡的），但当时自己还怪他们不应该。
    不相信群众：对群众力量表示怀疑，什么事也不敢放手让他们去做。譬如写黑板报，要战士们自己去写过几次，但马上就觉得他们既不会标题，字又潦草，于是索性不要他们写了；却没有想到怎样去耐心地帮助他们，虚心接受他们的意见，终至形成包办。自己忙不过来，也就不免敷衍塞责。
    接触面不广：仅凭一己的高兴，专和极少数几个文化程度较高的战士（多为解放过来不久的）打交道，而对其他大多数则采取漠不关心的态度，更谈不到主动的去靠近他们；这样便无形中使自己孤立起来。同时对一些思想上有毛病的战士们（新解放过来的大部正统观念很深），与之争论一两次后也就放任不理。以上不过是举其荦荦大者，自己感到半年来委实太对不起战士们，一度竟因此而失去了工作的勇气。但战士们对我一样的亲切与关心，却使我深感到我的错误及他们的宽大；只要我能勇于改正自己，有决心改造自己，战士们对我永远是表示欢迎的。
