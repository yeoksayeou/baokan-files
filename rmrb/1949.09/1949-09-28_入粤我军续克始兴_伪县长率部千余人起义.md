Xinhua News Agency, Guangdong-Jiangxi Front, 27th—The People's Liberation Army unit that liberated Nanxiong continued to advance and liberated Shixing County, 130 *li* northeast of Qujiang, at 6:00 AM on the 25th. The defending enemy abandoned the city and fled towards Qujiang. The People's Liberation Army took advantage of the victory to capture the Xiaojiang Dam and Shensuo bridges southwest of the city, killing and wounding dozens of enemies and capturing over forty. Before the liberation of Shixing, the original county chief, Rao Jimian, led over a thousand members of the Self-Defense Corps in an uprising on the night of the 22nd, engaging in fierce fighting with the 309th Regiment of the 103rd Division of the 39th Army, killing the commander of the 309th Regiment and a battalion commander. They then withdrew from the city and joined forces with the people's armed forces of northern Guangdong.
