Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 16th: The Polish Press Agency, London, September 15th: Australian doctor Urie, who worked in the health organization in Zagreb, Yugoslavia for sixteen years, recently returned home and told a reporter for the British Communist Worker's Daily that Tito has lost his influence over the masses of the Yugoslav people. He can only get the support of those privileged police groups, a few political leaders, and diplomatic representatives of capitalist countries. Urie said: I have recently traveled almost the entire Yugoslavia and can honestly say that I have not met anyone who agrees with the Tito government. He described the Tito group's reign of terror, saying: Anyone suspected of sympathizing with the Soviet Union or the Intelligence Bureau is arrested. In Zagreb alone, fifty to one hundred students are arrested every month. Concentration camps are established throughout Yugoslavia. Yugoslavia's five-year plan is a delusion. The people's living standards have been reduced by 50 percent and they are often forced to work.

　　南国各地遍设集中营没有一个人赞同铁托
　  澳医生尤里自南返英谈话
    【新华社北平十六日电】波兰通信社伦敦十五日讯：曾在南斯拉夫萨格勒布的卫生机关工作了十六年的澳大利亚医生尤里，最近归国对英共工人日报记者谈称：铁托已失去了对南斯拉夫人民群众的影响，他仅还能得到那些享有特权的警察集团、几个政治领袖和资本主义国家外交代表的支持。尤里说：我最近几乎游历了整个的南斯拉夫，并且能够忠实地说，没有遇见任何一个人赞同铁托政府。他叙述铁托集团的恐怖统治说：凡有对苏联或情报局表示同情之嫌者，即遭逮捕，单是萨格勒布一个地方，每月就有五十到一百个学生被捕。南斯拉夫各地遍设集中营。南斯拉夫的五年计划是虚妄的，人民生活水平已降低了百分之五十，而且常被强迫劳动。
