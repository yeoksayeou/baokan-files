A Record of Visits with Representatives of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference
	Zhai Shuzhen, a Heroic Daughter of the Working Class
	Qing Mei
	Zhai Shuzhen—a combat hero on the production front—initially impresses people as young, brave, and simple. She is only twenty-four years old this year, an optimistic, talkative, yet humble and prudent young woman. This past March, her resounding name was heard at the National Women's Congress, and now she is honored to attend the People's Political Consultative Conference.
	Looking at her youthful face, one would rarely consider that she has had any serious experiences. However, in Zhai Shuzhen's twelve years of work and struggle, she has written many heroic deeds.
	She grew up in the slums of the bustling city of Tianjin; her father was a poor cook. Hunger and poverty drove the proletariat into the cheap labor market, enduring cruel exploitation. The young Zhai Shuzhen was no exception. After managing to attend elementary school for four years, she was deprived of her right to education at the age of twelve and entered the Shuangxi Textile Factory, opened by Japanese devils, to work as a machine-cleaning girl. The devils in the factory and their running-dog foremen did not treat workers as human beings at all. Under the long-term brutal rule of the enemy, Zhai Shuzhen's spirit of resistance was cultivated, budding and growing, becoming resilient from its initial fragility. At the age of eighteen, she was working in the spooling section. At that time, unable to bear the oppression and abuse of the running-dog foreman, the young Zhai Shuzhen was the first to stand up and lead the workers of the entire section in a strike to resist. Everyone united around her, unafraid of threats, and persisted to the end, leaving the devils helpless. In the end, they had to agree to the workers' demands and fire that dog-leg. This was Zhai Shuzhen's first attempt to move from awareness to action. The fact profoundly educated her: when dealing with the enemy, only resistance is the path to survival, and unity is strength. Knowing the importance of unity, she highly promoted the spirit of mutual aid and friendship among the worker sisters, and the masses loved to be around her. The following year, she led the workers in the warping section in another strike, demanding that the devils pay extra wages and protesting the devils' insults and beatings of a female worker. The result was also a victory.
	During that period, due to a lack of political and class awareness, the young Zhai Shuzhen remained at the stage of spontaneous struggle. She firmly resisted the old, unreasonable social system but did not understand the origin of this system, let alone what it would become in the future. In the summer of 1945, Zhai Shuzhen met a stenographer, and the two became very close friends. Under her enlightenment and education, Zhai Shuzhen began to develop class consciousness, from vague to clear. For the first time since birth, she recognized her class vanguard—the Communist Party of China. In subsequent struggles, she used her exemplary actions to complete arduous tasks and awaken the consciousness of the masses.
	After the Japanese surrender, the Kuomintang bandit gang took over the Shuangxi Textile Factory, renaming it China Textile Factory No. 5. Bureaucratic capital replaced the Japanese invaders in exploiting and oppressing the workers. The darkness had not passed; on the contrary, the suffering had intensified. At that time, the factory paid wages based on the quantity of yarn produced, and each worker received only over two hundred catties of corn flour per month. The reactionary factory director colluded with the yellow trade union in the factory to exploit the workers in every possible way. They converted the corn flour, which had a market price of 75 yuan per catty, into cash at a standard of 50 yuan, causing great losses to all the workers in the factory. Zhai Shuzhen mobilized the masses to sign a petition and nominated their own representatives to negotiate with the factory. Knowing they were in the wrong, the bandit gang dispatched reactionary factory protection troops and labor traitors to suppress them. They heavily surrounded the workers' representatives, detained two representatives on the spot, and drove the rest out after beating them with rifle butts. Zhai Shuzhen told all the factory workers about what happened, which immediately aroused the anger of the masses. More than two thousand people rushed towards the director's office like a tide to demand the return of the representatives. Although the Kuomintang bandit army had set up four machine guns at the entrance, they were afraid to move under the roar of the masses. At this time, the factory used tricks, cunningly saying to the workers, "Do you want money or people?" Attempting to lure the masses, but the masses resolutely refused to sell out their representatives and insisted on releasing them. Fearing the power of the masses, the reactionary factory director finally had to release the workers' representatives, and the deducted wages were also fully compensated. This struggle also achieved victory.
	After the Japanese surrender, Li Yuxiang, a traitor and special agent who had colluded with the Japanese invaders to brutally rule over them in the past, was not only not punished in any way but was instead re-employed by Kuomintang agents to continue leading the yellow trade union in the factory and was hostile to the workers to the end. In order to redress the grievances of the murdered workers, Zhai Shuzhen boldly mobilized the masses to accuse him, but the Kuomintang government shamelessly protected the murderer, ignoring them. All the factory workers demonstrated in the rain, demanding the punishment of Li Yuxiang. The heroic Zhai Shuzhen, with the support of the masses, attended the reactionary court and confronted the murderer. Under the pressure of the masses, the puppet court dared not obliterate the facts and had to sentence the murderer to five years in prison. However, this murderer was shamefully released by the bandit gang before the liberation of Tianjin.
	Zhai Shuzhen heroically led the workers in unremitting struggle against the reactionaries, arousing the factory's immense hatred for her. Special agents and bandits tried to frame her several times, but under the protection and rescue of the masses, Zhai Shuzhen was not harmed. On May 4, 1946, she was finally arrested along with more than thirty workers by reactionary military police. During the enemy's interrogation, Zhai Shuzhen did not reveal a single secret. The day she was released, the factory fired her and even notified other factories not to hire her. However, soon the young and brave Zhai Shuzhen found an opportunity to enter China Textile Factory No. 2 and continue her revolutionary work.
	In 1947, the great People's Liberation War was advancing victoriously. The Kuomintang bandit gang in Pingjin became anxious and planned to "move the factories south." This conspiracy was quickly exposed due to the fierce resistance of the working masses. At that time, China Textile Factory No. 2 had also asked workers to dismantle the machines. The conscious workers in the factory then told everyone: "The factory belongs to us workers. If the Kuomintang moves the machines away, how will we workers survive!" In this way, the workers quickly became aware. Everyone hated the reactionaries' "move south" conspiracy to the bone, and no one wanted to dismantle the machines anymore. Some even reinstalled the disassembled parts, thus crushing the reactionaries' "move south" conspiracy.
	Before the liberation of Tianjin, Zhai Shuzhen organized factory protection work. In China Textile Factory No. 2, she mobilized female workers to participate in the workers' pickets and mobilized the masses to monitor the conspiratorial activities of special agents within the factory. Therefore, when the great People's Liberation Army entered Tianjin on January 17, China Textile Factory No. 2 became the property of the people intact, and all the workers and Zhai Shuzhen gloriously completed the task of protecting the factory.
	After liberation, the working class of Tianjin turned from slaves into masters. Zhai Shuzhen continued to lead the factory in striving to improve work efficiency and product quality with her exemplary actions. Due to the love and support of the masses, the young Zhai Shuzhen is already an outstanding leader among the female workers of Tianjin. She has been elected as a standing committee member of the Tianjin Textile Committee, a member of the Tianjin Municipal Consultative Committee, and the welfare minister of the Tianjin Women's Federation. However, she does not feel the slightest bit of pride because of this. On the contrary, she is even more humbly learning from the masses. As she told reporters during this People's Political Consultative Conference: My attending the CPPCC meeting represents everyone. This is not only my personal glory, but the glorious achievement gained by the arduous struggle, bloodshed, and sacrifice of all the female workers and the entire Chinese working class over the past few decades!

　　中国人民政协代表访问记
  　工人阶级的英勇女儿——翟淑珍
    庆楣
    翟淑珍——生产战线上的战斗英雄，她首先给人的印象是年青、勇敢和纯朴。她今年才二十四岁，是一个乐观、健谈而又谦虚持重的青年。今年三月间，全国妇代大会上有过她的响亮名字，现在，她又光荣地出席了人民政协会议。
    从她那样稚气未脱的脸上，人们很少会考虑到她有过什么严重的经历。但在翟淑珍年青的十二年工作战斗中，却写下了许多英勇的事迹。
    她成长在天津繁华都市的贫民窟里，父亲是一个贫苦的厨工。饥饿和穷困驱使无产者投入廉价的劳动市场，忍受残酷的剥削。年幼的翟淑珍也没有例外。她好容易上了四年小学，十二岁那年便被剥夺了求学的权利，跨进日本鬼子开办的双喜纺织工厂，当一个擦机器的女童工。厂里的鬼子和走狗工头根本不把工人当作人看。在敌人长期的残暴的统治下，培养出翟淑珍的反抗思想，由萌芽而茁壮，由脆弱而坚韧。十八岁那年，她在打轴科打纱。当时因忍不住走狗工头的欺压和虐待，年青的翟淑珍就第一个起来，领导全科工人罢工反抗。大家团结在她的周围，不怕威胁，坚持到底，弄得鬼子没法可想，最后只得答应工人的要求把那条狗腿开革了。这是翟淑珍从意识到行动的第一次尝试。事实深刻地教育了她：对付敌人，只有反抗才是生路，团结就是力量。她知道团结一致的重要，因此在工人姊妹群中她高度发挥了互助友爱的精神，群众都爱跟她接近。第二年，她又领导了整经科工人罢工，要求鬼子发加点费和抗议鬼子辱打一位女工。结果也得到了胜利。
    那一时期，年青的翟淑珍由于缺乏政治和阶级认识，她只停留在自发性的斗争阶段上。她坚决反抗旧的不合理的社会制度，但却不明白这种制度的由来，更不知道将来变成什么样？一九四五年夏天，翟淑珍遇到了一位速记女工，两人的友谊很密切，在她的启发和教育下，翟淑珍开始有了阶级觉悟，从模糊到清晰。她出生以来第一次认识了自己的阶级先锋队——中国共产党。在以后的斗争中，她以自己的模范行动来完成艰巨任务，唤起群众的觉悟。
    日本投降后，国民党匪帮接收了双喜纺织工厂。改为中纺第五厂。官僚资本替代了日寇对工人的剥削压迫。黑暗并未过去，痛苦反而加重。那时，工厂以面计发工资，每一工人每月只得玉米面二百多斤。反动厂长勾结厂内的黄色工会，百般剥削工人。他们把市价七十五元一斤的玉米面照五十元标准折现发下，使全厂工人受到很大损失。翟淑珍发动群众签名并推出自己的代表向厂方交涉。匪帮自知理亏，竟调遣反动的护厂部队和工贼来镇压。把工人代表重重包围，当场扣留二个代表，其余的都在枪托痛打下被驱逐出来。翟淑珍将事情经过告诉了全厂工友，立刻激起群众的愤怒。二千多人象潮水一般冲向厂长室去要回代表。虽然，国民党匪军已在入口处架起四挺枪，但在群众怒吼下，吓得匪军不敢动弹。这时，厂方就施用伎俩，狡点地对工人说：“你们要钱还是要人？”企图利诱群众，但群众决不出卖自己的代表，坚决要把代表释放，反动厂长害怕群众的力量，最后只得把工人代表开释，而且克扣的工资也照数补发了，这次斗争也获得了胜利。
    日本投降后，过去勾结日寇凶暴地统治他们的汉奸特务李玉祥，不但不受任何惩罚，反被国民党特务起用，继续来领导厂内的黄色工会，与工人敌对到底。翟淑珍为了替被害工友雪冤，大胆地发动群众控告，但国民党政府竟无耻地包庇杀人凶手，爱理不理。全厂工人群众就冒雨示威，要求惩办李玉祥。英勇的翟淑珍在群众支持下出席反动法庭和凶手对质，伪法庭在群众的压力下，不敢抹杀事实，只得将凶手判处五年徒刑。但在天津解放前，这个凶手却被无耻的匪帮释放了。
    翟淑珍英勇地领导工人与反动派作不懈的斗争，引起了厂方对她万分仇恨。特务匪徒几次想陷害她，可是在群众的保护和营救下，翟淑珍未遭毒手。一九四六年五月初四日，她终于和三十多个工友一起被反动军警逮捕了。在敌人审讯中，翟淑珍没有暴露一丝的秘密。当她释出那天，厂方就开除了她，而且还通告别的工厂不准雇佣她，但不久年青勇敢的翟淑珍却找到机会进了中纺二厂，继续她的革命工作。
    一九四七年，伟大的人民解放战争胜利地向前发展。平津的国民党匪帮着了急，曾打算“工厂南迁”。这一阴谋，因为受到工人群众的剧烈反抗，很快就败露了。当时中纺二厂也曾叫工人拆卸机器。厂中有觉悟的工人就向大伙宣传说：“工厂是我们工人的，国民党把机器搬走了，叫咱们工人靠什么过活啊！”这样，工人们很快就觉悟了。大伙对反动派的“南迁”阴谋，痛恨入骨，谁也不愿再拆机器了，有的甚至把已经卸下的机件重新装上，因而粉碎了反动派的“南迁”阴谋。
    在天津解放前，翟淑珍就组织护厂工作。她在中纺二厂发动女工参加工人纠察队，并动员群众来监视厂内特务分子的阴谋活动。所以，当一月十七日，伟大的人民解放军进入天津时，中纺二厂就完整地成了人民的财产，全体工人和翟淑珍光荣地完成了护厂任务。
    解放后，天津的工人阶级由奴隶变为主人。翟淑珍继续以自己的模范行动领导厂内为提高工作效率和出品质量而努力。由于群众的热爱和拥护，年青的翟淑珍已经是天津女工中的一位卓越领袖，他被推选为天津市纺织委员会常委，天津市各界协商委员会委员，天津市妇联福利部长。但她并不因此而感到丝毫自傲。相反地，她却更加虚心向群众学习了。正如这次她参加人民政协对记者所说的：我出席政协会议是代表大家的。这不单是我一个人的光荣，而是全体女工和整个中国工人阶级几十年来艰苦奋斗，流血牺牲所获得的光荣成果！
