　　Peking University CPC General Branch and Four Other Units Hold
　　Sino-Soviet Friendship Forum
    More Than Two Thousand People Enthusiastically Discuss Studying the Soviet Union; Comrade Chen Shaoyu Attends and Delivers Concluding Speech
    [Reported by this newspaper] The Peking University CPC General Branch, the Peking University Communist Youth League General Branch, the Peking University Faculty and Staff Union, the Peking University Student Union, and the Peking University Workers and Police Union jointly held a Sino-Soviet Friendship Forum on the evening of September 8th in the auditorium of the Third Courtyard of Peking University. Approximately two thousand faculty, students, staff, and guests attended the conference, with people crowding outside the windows of the auditorium. The arrangement of the venue was simple and solemn. On the rostrum, gigantic portraits of Lenin, Sun Yat-sen, Stalin, and Chairman Mao were hung between the Soviet flag and the People's Liberation Army flag, symbolizing the unity of the Chinese and Soviet people. Ye Xiangzhong, Secretary of the Peking University CPC General Branch and chairman of the conference, first explained that the purpose of holding the conference was to understand the Soviet Union, learn from the Soviet Union, and consolidate and develop Sino-Soviet friendship. Then, he briefly and specifically explained from the basic change in the situation where China had changed from a country ruled by reactionaries to a people's democratic country why we should stand on the side of the Soviet Union, why we should understand the Soviet Union, learn from the Soviet Union, and consolidate Sino-Soviet friendship. The conference discussion was divided into three sections: (1) Sino-Soviet relations; (2) Learning from the Soviet Union; (3) Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. Faculty, students, and staff spoke enthusiastically and succinctly. Until the chairman announced the end of the discussion, many people still had their hands raised for a long time before reluctantly putting them down. Finally, Comrade Chen Shaoyu, who was invited to attend, delivered a two-and-a-half-hour concluding speech.
    During the discussion on Sino-Soviet relations, everyone pointed out that the relationship between Tsarist Russia and China before the October Revolution was an imperialist aggression relationship; the relationship between the Soviet Union and China after the October Revolution was a friendly relationship between socialist countries, and the Soviet Union was the loyal friend and mentor of the Chinese people. A worker from the Peking University Publishing Department listed the facts of Soviet assistance to the Chinese people after the October Revolution, illustrating that the victory of the Chinese revolution was inseparable from the powerful existence of the socialist Soviet Union. Finally, Mr. Wang Tieya summarized everyone's speeches.
    Regarding the discussion of learning from the Soviet Union, everyone unanimously agreed that the Soviet Union and China are fraternal countries led by the working class, and the path of the revolutionary and advanced Soviet Union is the path of the Chinese people. In answering the question of what to learn from the Soviet Union, a worker said in a firm tone: We must learn from the Soviet Union how to build a backward agricultural country into an advanced industrial country. His words were quoted many times by later speakers. A student said: We often say that we should learn from the old liberated areas and from the working class. The Soviet Union is the old liberated area of the world, and the Soviet working class is the most advanced and powerful working class in the world, so we should learn from the Soviet Union. His brief and powerful speech was unanimously applauded by everyone. Later, Mr. Wu Qingyou summarized this part of the speech. He particularly pointed out the need to learn from the great patriotism and internationalism of the Soviet people and the spirit of hard work, self-reliance, and regeneration.
    Regarding the discussion of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, Mr. Xu Deheng, Mr. Qian Duansheng, Mr. Fan Hong, and Mr. Tang Yongtong were invited to speak in succession. Mr. Xu called on everyone to actively participate in the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and its various tasks. Mr. Qian explained that the significance of establishing the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association lies in systematically and organizationally learning from the Soviet Union and strengthening the understanding of the Soviet Union. Mr. Fan pointed out that the New Democratic China and the Socialist Soviet Union have a strong foundation and full conditions for mutual friendship. Old Mr. Tang pointed out: Today's conference is the beginning of the entire Peking University learning from the Soviet Union. In the future, we must systematically and deeply learn from the Soviet Union in all aspects in order to be a good student of the Soviet Union.
    After a five-minute break at the conference, Comrade Chen Shaoyu began to deliver a concluding speech amidst enthusiastic applause from the audience. He first exhaustively analyzed the various great assistance, direct and indirect, tangible and intangible, of the Soviet Union to the cause of the Chinese people's liberation. Then, he talked about why we should learn from the Soviet Union and what to learn from it. He explained that Mr. Sun Yat-sen, based on his forty years of revolutionary experience, called on the Chinese people to take Russia as their teacher, and Chairman Mao instructed that the historical experience of the Chinese revolution proves that the Chinese working class and the Chinese people must "follow the path of the Russians." There are only two paths in the world now: one is the "path of the Russians," which is the path to socialism and then to communism, which is the path to the liberation and happiness of the vast masses of people and the liberation and happiness of all advanced human beings; the other is the path of British and American capitalists, which is the path to the poverty and death of the vast working people and the enrichment of a very small number of capitalists. At the same time, he compared the advantages and disadvantages of the two paths from the political, economic, cultural, national defense, and diplomatic aspects, proving that the socialist system is superior to the capitalist system in all aspects. He called on everyone to enthusiastically learn from the experience of the Soviet people in revolution and construction under the leadership of the great Lenin and Stalin. He encouraged everyone to learn from the spirit of heroic struggle and arduous construction of the Soviet people. He also pointed out that the friendly unity of the Chinese and Soviet people is a matter of great significance and an important guarantee for striving for lasting world peace and people's democracy.
    Finally, he praised the spirit of unity and the organized and disciplined phenomenon displayed by all the faculty, students, and staff of Peking University at the conference. He hoped that everyone would unanimously follow Chairman Mao's instructions: learn from the Soviet Union with an honest and respectful attitude, and actively participate in the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association.
    Comrade Chen Shaoyu ended his speech amidst prolonged and enthusiastic applause. Finally, the chairman of the conference called on all faculty, students, and staff of Peking University to systematically, regularly, and continuously understand the Soviet Union, learn from the Soviet Union, actively participate in the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, and consolidate and develop Sino-Soviet friendship after this conference. He also reported that all students of the Department of Chemistry and the Pre-Medical Department initiated a signature campaign to participate in the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association.
    The conference lasted until 12:00 midnight, and the faculty, students, and staff who attended and crowded outside the windows maintained an excited and happy mood throughout. There was no sign of relaxation at the venue. This was the first time that the Peking University Party General Branch publicly co-sponsored a conference with mass organizations. The conference ended in enthusiastic cheers: "Consolidate Sino-Soviet Friendship," "Learn from the Soviet Union," "Long Live Stalin," and "Long Live Mao Zedong."

　　北大中共总支等五单位举行
　  中苏友好座谈大会
    二千余人热烈讨论学习苏联陈绍禹同志出席作总结发言
    【本报讯】中共北大总支、青年团北大总支、北大教职联、北大学生会、北大工警工会五单位于九月八日晚在北大三院礼堂联合召开中苏友好座谈大会。参加大会的约有二千左右的师生员工和来宾，礼堂的窗口外都挤满了人。会场的布置朴素庄严。主席台上，在苏联国旗与人民解放军军旗之间悬挂着列宁、孙中山、斯大林、毛主席的巨像，象征中苏人民的团结。大会主席中共北大总支书记叶向忠首先说明了举办大会的目的在于认识苏联，学习苏联和巩固与发展中苏友谊。接着他从中国已由反动派统治的国家变成人民民主国家这一基本形势的改变简短具体地说明了为什么要站在苏联一边以及为什么要认识苏联，学习苏联和巩固中苏友谊。大会讨论分三节进行：（一）中苏关系；（二）学习苏联；（三）中苏友好协会。师生员工发言热烈紧凑，直到主席宣布停止讨论时，还有许多举了好久的手才勉强放下来。最后被邀莅会的陈绍禹同志作了两点半钟的总结发言。
    讨论中苏关系时，大家指出十月革命以前的帝俄对中国的关系是帝国主义的侵略关系；十月革命以后的苏联对中国的关系是社会主义国家的友好关系，苏联是中国人民的忠诚朋友和导师。北大出版部工友列举十月革命以后苏联援助中国人民的事实，说明了中国革命的胜利与社会主义苏联的强大存在分不开。最后由王铁崖先生总结了大家的发言。
    关于学习苏联的讨论，大家一致认为苏联和中国都是工人阶级领导的兄弟国家，革命先进的苏联的道路便是中国人民的道路。在回答向苏联学习什么这一问题时，一位工友用坚强的语气肯定的说：要学习苏联怎样把落后的农业国建设成先进的工业国。他的话被以后的发言人多次引用。一位同学说：我们常说要向老解放区学习，要向工人阶级学习。苏联是世界的老解放区，苏联的工人阶级正是世界上最先进最强大的工人阶级队伍，所以我们应该向苏联学习。他简短有力的发言获得了大家一致的鼓掌。后来吴清友先生作了这一部分发言的总结。他特别指出需要学习苏联人民伟大的爱国主义及国际主义精神和刻苦耐劳、自力更生的建设精神。
    关于中苏友好协会的讨论，先后请了许德珩、钱端升、樊弘、汤用彤四先生发言。许先生号召大家要踊跃参加中苏友好协会及其各种工作。钱先生说明了成立中苏友好协会的意义在于有系统有组织地学习苏联，加强对于苏联的认识。樊先生指明新民主主义的中国与社会主义的苏联有相互友好的坚强基础和充分条件。汤老先生指出：今天的大会是全北大向苏联学习的开始，以后要有系统地、深刻地从各方面学习苏联，才能做苏联的一个好学生。
    大会休息了五分钟以后，在台下热烈鼓掌中陈绍禹同志开始作总结发言。他首先详尽分析苏联对于中国人民解放事业的直接的与间接的、有形的与无形的各种伟大援助。接着说到为什么要学习苏联和学习些什么，他说明，孙中山先生积四十年革命之经验号召中国人民要以俄为师，毛主席指示中国革命的历史经验证明中国工人阶级和中国人民必须“走俄国人的路”。现在世界上只有两条路：一条是“俄国人的路”，这就是经过社会主义走进共产主义的路，就是各国广大人民群众解放幸福以及全体先进人类解放幸福的路；另一条是英美资本家的路，就是广大劳动人民贫困死亡和极少数资本家发财致富的路。同时他从政治、经济、文化、国防、外交各方面比较两条路的优劣，证明社会主义制度在各方面都优于资本主义制度。他号召大家热诚地学习苏联人民在伟大的列宁、斯大林领导下的革命与建设的经验。他勉励大家要学习苏联人民英勇奋斗与艰苦建设的精神。并指出：中苏人民的友好团结是一件具有伟大意义的事情，是争取世界持久和平与人民民主的重要保障。
    最后他称赞北大全体师生员工在大会中表现的团结一致的精神和大会的有组织与有纪律的现象。他希望大家一致遵照毛主席指示：抱着老老实实和恭恭敬敬的态度，向苏联学习，踊跃地参加中苏友好协会。
    陈绍禹同志在长久热烈的掌声中结束了他的发言。最后由大会主席号召北大全体师生员工从这个会后有系统地经常不断地认识苏联，学习苏联，踊跃参加中苏友好协会，巩固与发展中苏友谊。并报告了化学系与医预系两系全体同学发起参加中苏友协的签名运动。
    大会一直进行到深夜十二时，到会的以及挤在窗外的师生员工都一直保持着兴奋、愉快的情绪，会场没有一点松懈的现象。这是北大党总支第一次公开地和群众团体联合举办的一个大会，大会在热烈的欢呼：“巩固中苏友谊”，“向苏联学习”，“斯大林万岁”，“毛泽东万岁”声中结束。
