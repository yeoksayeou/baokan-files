Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, September 27th: In order to correctly implement the reorganization policy and correct certain biases in some units regarding the handling of former employees, the Shanghai Military Control Commission and the People's Government recently, based on the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's decision on handling former Kuomintang personnel, jointly issued "Important Points for Attention in Handling Former Employees," ordering all units to register and properly resettle former employees who have no means of support due to redundancy. The circular stipulates that all former employees who have been laid off and truly have no means of support can register with their original departments, which will handle them separately according to the following different circumstances: (1) For those who are indeed in distress after being laid off and cannot find a way out of life, the original departments should take the initiative to recall them and properly handle them. If they have considerable working ability and are sincerely willing to serve the people, the original departments should properly resettle them, adhering to the spirit of "three people eating the food of five," and provide them with appropriate work or learning opportunities to avoid displacement. (2) For general dismissed personnel who have already obtained other jobs, regardless of their current position or whether the nature of the job is completely suitable, it is hoped that they will continue to work with peace of mind, understanding the government's current difficulties, and not seek to be transferred elsewhere. In the future, as construction undertakings gradually develop and the country needs talents, they can be given priority for employment according to their individual expertise. (3) For those who are old and weak, unable to perform their duties, and have been laid off, if they have no savings and no close relatives responsible for their support, the government will show sympathy. After registration, efforts should be made to properly resettle them. If they can still perform other light tasks, they should also be given work or helped to change jobs. (4) When handling registration, investigation, or taking the initiative to recall, all departments should provide appropriate reception, carefully understand, and provide comfort and explanation, so that they can understand the government's prudent handling policy and know where to work towards. They cannot be dealt with hastily due to being busy, nor can they be treated rudely because their requests are not met. At the same time, they should fully understand the actual situation, distinguish the types, and seek more appropriate solutions. (5) For those who were originally expelled for criminal behavior, if they apply to their original departments for registration, a careful review should be conducted again to distinguish right from wrong. If they are not extremely heinous or notoriously bad elements, and have already confessed their mistakes, the government, based on its lenient policy of education and salvation, will still give them a path to self-renewal. It is hoped that they will thoroughly realize their mistakes, make an early decision, and transform themselves through labor. If they are willing to go to reclamation areas to engage in production, they will be given assistance.

　　Regarding units at all levels that have not been effectively reorganized, the circular stipulates: In the future, when streamlining and downsizing, the handling of former personnel should be even more clearly distinguished between right and wrong, and the targets should be clearly distinguished. Except for individual elements with notorious records and opposed by the masses, the policy of unity and transformation should be adopted, and more consideration should be given to their livelihood. All units should act in a serious, responsible, and proper resettlement spirit, and handle them separately according to the following points: (1) For surplus personnel after reorganization, if the original departments cannot directly and appropriately resettle them for the time being, the Commission and the Government will set up learning institutions in appropriate locations, mobilize them to go to the countryside to study, explain the reasons for streamlining and the individual's future, so that they can consciously and voluntarily accept the assignment. Then organize them, transfer them in batches, and appropriately solve their difficulties. (2) Those who are younger, have fewer burdens, and are more suitable for further study should be introduced to appropriate educational institutions to cultivate talents for national construction. In special circumstances, the age limit can be relaxed to broaden the scope of training. (3) Those who are suitable for retention but exceed the authorized size of the institution may temporarily set up training courses attached to the original institution, training in rotation. In the future, depending on the needs of the undertaking, in addition to being transferred to the original institution, they can also be assigned to the same system in other regions. (4) The above resettlement methods should be agreed to by the individuals as much as possible and submitted to the higher authorities for approval. Their concerns about their current life and future prospects should be discussed in many ways to help them solve them. Those who return to their hometowns will be given various conveniences and material assistance. Those who study will be informed of the treatment system and solve their certain difficulties. Those who change careers will be given help. Those who must be expelled should also be allowed to clarify the facts, so that they can be convinced, given more education to help them be good, so that they can live in peace and abide by the law, and seek their own livelihoods, or help them reclaim land and create new homes. (5) Other people who have no way out except to be retained should be properly deployed and resettled by their original departments.

　　In addition, the circular also stipulates: For former personnel who are laid off and participate in learning and training, except for special technical personnel, the salary and benefits are uniformly provided for living expenses according to the treatment of trainees. If the family life of the learners is indeed difficult, their minimum living standard must be taken care of. However, the free schooling for children, preferential treatment for public utilities, and other items are still treated the same as other retained personnel.

　　正确执行整编方针
  　妥善处理旧员工
    上海规定因裁减而生活无着者，概予登记安置。
    【新华社上海二十七日电】上海市军事管制委员会和人民政府，为正确执行整编方针，纠正若干单位对于处理旧员工的某些偏向，最近根据中共中央关于处理国民党的旧工作人员的决定，联合发布“关于处理旧员工的应行注意事项”，通令各单位对旧员工因裁减而生活无着者，概予登记，并妥善安置。通令规定，凡已被裁减之旧员工，确实生活无着，得向原机关登记，由该机关按照下述各种不同情节，分别处理之：（一）凡裁减后确系陷于困窘，无法求得生活出路者，原机关应主动召回，予以妥善处理。如有相当工作能力，且诚意愿为人民服务，则本三个人饭五个人吃的精神，原机关应妥善安置，予以适当工作或学习机会，以免流离失所。（二）一般的被遣散人员，已经另行获得职业者，不论目前地位大小或性质是否完全适合，均望照旧继续安心工作，体谅政府当前困难，不必另求调动，将来建设事业逐渐开展，国家需要人材时，自可根据个人专长分别优先录用。（三）因老迈体弱，不堪任事而被裁减，如素无积蓄亦无相当亲属负责赡养，无法生活者，政府自更寄以同情。办理登记后，应即设法妥为安置。如尚可充任其他轻便事务者，亦应给予工作或帮助其转业。（四）各机关办理登记、调查或主动召回时，应适当接待，细心体察，予以安慰与解释，使他们认识政府审慎处理之方针而知所努力，不能因忙碌而草率应付，不能以其要求不合而粗暴对待。同时应充分了解实际情形，分清类型，求得更适当之处理。（五）原来因有犯罪行为而被开除者，如本人向原机关要求登记时，应再为慎重审查，分清是非。如非罪大恶极，劣迹昭著的分子，已经坦白悔过者，开除后确系无法为生，政府本宽大政策教育挽救之方针，仍予以自新之路。希望其本人彻底觉悟，早下决心，于劳动生活中改造自己。如愿去垦区从事生产，当予以资助。
    对于未经切实整编的各级单位，通令规定：今后在进行精简缩并时，对于旧人员之处理，更应明辨是非，分清对象，除个别劣迹昭著，群众反对者以外，一律采取团结和改造的方针，更为其生活出路多加考虑。各单位悉本郑重负责、妥善安置之精神，依照下列各点分别办理：（１）整编后多余人员，原机关一时无法直接适当安置者，由本会、府另在适当地点设立学习机关，分别动员下乡学习，说明精简理由与个人前途，使之自觉自愿，接受分配。然后加以组织，分批转送，并适当解决其困难。（２）年事较轻，牵累较少，比较适宜于深造者，介绍进适当的教育机关，分科培养建国人材。遇有特殊情形，并可商请放宽年龄限制，以广造就。（３）适宜于留用而超出于机关编制定额者，暂就原机关附设训练班，轮流训练，以后视事业需要，除就原机关调补外，并可分配于其他地区之相同系统。（４）以上各项安置办法，应尽量通过其本人同意，报送上级批准。对其当前生活与今后出路之顾虑，应多方商酌，助其解决。回乡者予以各种便利及物质上之资助。学习者说明待遇制度，解决其一定之困难。转者业予以帮助。即须开除者亦应准其辩明事实，使之折服，多予教育，助其向善，使能安分守法，自谋生计，或助其开垦，另创家务。（５）其他非留用即无出路者，由原机关适当调度安置之。
    此外，通令又规定：对于被裁参加学习训练之旧人员，薪金待遇除特殊技术人员以外，一律按学员待遇供给生活。学习人员家属生活确有困难者，必须照顾其最低限度之生活。惟关于子女上学免费办法，公用事业优待办法等项，仍与其他留用者同等待遇。
