　　How Does the Fengtai Railway Maintenance Section Maintain the Railways?
　　Xing Jun
　　Strengthening railway maintenance and improving marching speed are important foundations for the construction of people's railways. Since the day they broke away from the old slave life and became masters, more than 600 employees of the Fengtai Railway Maintenance Section have shouldered this task; and combined with the continuous absorption of new experiences and high enthusiasm, they have achieved good results.
　　In the early days after liberation, the percentage of rotten sleepers on the entire line reached 37%, and the driving speed was only 40 kilometers. It was extremely urgent to repair the line. However, at that time, due to the old style of administration and certain concerns, the leaders were unwilling to take bold responsibility, and the work was unplanned, forming a situation where the track section foreman took care of everything: today he ordered to change a few sleepers on the east side, and tomorrow he tightened the tracks on the west side. The thinking was that as long as there were no derailments in my area, it would be good enough; some workers also reflected: "We have turned over, we can work by ourselves, and we don't need supervisors anymore!" The supervisors felt uneasy because their personal errands were not reaching up or down. Therefore, work efficiency was not high. After the handover was completed and the work entered a regular phase, relevant leading cadres assisted the section in convening an expanded production meeting attended by worker representatives, reviewed the blindness in production, set the goal of increasing the driving speed to 80 kilometers in the first half of the year, and established labor discipline, and then launched a production competition to welcome "May Day." The section organized propaganda teams to go to each work area to provide specific assistance, and the work began to undergo new changes. In the replacement of sleepers, the previous average of four per person per day increased to eight; the screening of road ballast increased from five meters to ten meters; and the tamping increased from thirteen blocks to twenty-four blocks. Until Red May, nearly 60,000 man-hours of voluntary overtime were worked, completing the scheduled plan ahead of schedule. Although this stage had a tendency to neglect quality and overwork the workers due to the pursuit of quantity, the road maintenance work still made a step forward.
　　In June, on the basis of realizing democratic management, the implementation of new road maintenance systems and methods began. That is, the railway maintenance responsibility system and the "three inspections" system for routes. The former, according to the workers' personal experience, believed that before the route was completely repaired, there were more tasks that needed to be concentrated on for assault, such as mechanical division of labor according to the nature of the work was not very suitable; therefore, a method of "division of responsibility and collective work" was adopted within the scope of each track section, dividing into groups. However, in practice, in order to compete for model status, each group reported that the section of road they were responsible for was not good and hoped that everyone would go to their section for repairs first, which made the foremen very difficult. Later, each work area established evaluation groups, and the problem was solved by deciding the order of priority based on the quality of the lines. Subsequently, each group automatically established a work completion inspection system, jointly stipulating that when replacing sleepers, they must first be tightened and then nailed, and their own marks must be drawn on the sleepers. If substandard ones were found, they would be criticized and reworked, and good ones would be encouraged and commended, greatly enhancing the workers' sense of responsibility. Many workers provided their own materials to repair tools, and some patrolled the lines they were responsible for in the rain to check for any abnormalities. Track inspector Zhao He said: "I look at my own tracks every day, just like an old farmer looks at his own crops. I feel close, and I want to fix it when there is something wrong." In terms of quality, in more than two months, tool savings were 30%, loose screws were reduced from 40% to 5%; floating spikes were reduced from 70% to 8%; and because the lines were divided into sections for responsibility, each section needed to select a group leader to grasp the overall work, which invisibly cultivated four or five cadres in each work area. The route three inspection system is the experience learned from the Suihua Railway Maintenance Section by the worker representatives who went to Northeast China to visit. At the July production and savings meeting, the draft three inspection plan was studied. Everyone believed that if we followed the methods of "Class A Inspection" which is to repair the route as thoroughly as possible with all possible conditions, so that the route is close to standardization; "Class B Inspection" is to carry out general repairs, so that the driving speed gradually increases; "Class C Inspection" is to only carry out slight repairs to maintain the status quo, we can overcome the blindness in railway maintenance work. Therefore, according to the specific situation of the lines in this section, it was stipulated that in July, August, and September, one-third of the work hours would be used for Class A inspection of 40 kilometers of route, and one-half of the work hours would be used for "Class B Inspection", striving to increase the driving speed to 85 kilometers by the end of September. The results of the trial implementation were very good and it is now close to completion. Meng Shuchun, an old worker with 44 years of railway maintenance experience, said: "Before, working was blind, but now the clues are clear; the roads were good in the old Beining era because there were many people and sufficient materials, but now the roads are good because of scientific methods." Chen Fujji, a worker in the Luofa work area, said: "When I first did Class A inspection, I thought in my heart that it was a stupid idea to move the set of locomotives to the railway line. Now when I look at the places that have been inspected by Class A, no grass grows, it is easier to tighten the tracks, and it is safer to drive, and I know that this is a good idea."
　　In addition, it is worth mentioning the flood prevention in the rainy season and joint railway maintenance. The soil quality between Luofa and Yangcun on the Pingjin line is poor, and it is close to the Yongding and Bei Canal Rivers, which flood nine out of ten years, which has been a headache for many years. This year, the railway belongs to the people, and the masters do not want it to be harmed again. Therefore, before the rainy season, pile driving, laying of rubble, stacking of sacks, and necessary track lifting and ditch digging were carried out on the narrow and soft sections of the roadbed to ensure good drainage of the roadbed. During the rainy season, the workers closely contacted the peasant masses and jointly prevented floods on the premise of protecting the roads and fields. When the river embankment breached, everyone rushed to repair it together, safely passing the dangerous period in the three-month continuous flood fight. Joint railway maintenance is a creation since liberation. In July, encouraged by the achievements of railway maintenance in Qinhuangdao, with the lead of the workers of the railway maintenance section and the support of various station sections, a voluntary joint railway maintenance movement was launched. 4,000 employees and family members cleared the ballast in the station. The railway hospital organized an on-site medical treatment team to take care of everyone's health; some station areas organized technical guidance groups to ensure the required standard quality. Douzhangzhuang and Huangtu Slope stations mobilized the nearby farmers to participate in railway maintenance. By the end of August, a total of 30 kilometers of route had been completed. And from the joint labor, the unity between departments and employees was enhanced. This is an important gain.
　　In the past nine months, the Fengtai railway maintenance work has shown a brand-new look. In addition to relying on the consciousness and enthusiasm of the employees, it also contains two factors. One is to strengthen the connection between the leadership and the masses - especially after the realization of democratic management, the section chief and technical personnel often go to the countryside to guide, and hold meetings of foremen and foremen on time to report on work and exchange experience. One is to consciously cultivate typical work areas (such as Yangcun) and typical figures (such as Zhao Zheming of the Fengtai Second Track Section), who played a leading role. Recently, the railway maintenance section conducted an inspection and summary of the railway maintenance work, and all employees are working hard to strive to increase the driving speed to 90 kilometers during the New Year.

　　丰台工务段是怎样养路的？
    邢军
    加强养路，提高行军速度，是人民铁路建设上的重要基矗丰台工务段六百余名职工，从摆脱旧的奴隶生活，成为主人的那天起，便担当了这一任务；并在不断吸收新的经验和高度热情结合下，获得较好的成绩。
    解放后的初期，全线枕木腐朽到百分之三十七，行车速度不过四十公里，整修路线十分迫切。但当时由于行政领导上的旧作风和某些顾虑，不肯大胆负责，工作没有计划，形成道班工长一把抓：今天指挥去东边换几根枕木，明天又到西边扎扎道，思想认为只要我的管内不掉车，就算不错；也有些工友反映：“我们翻身啦，自己会干活，不必再要监工员了！”监工员感到个人的差使上下够不着，而情绪不安。因此，工作效率不高。待接交完毕，工作步入正规，有关领导干部协助段内召开了职工代表参加的扩大生产会议，检查了生产中的盲目性，定出上半年提高行车速度到八十公里的奋斗目标和劳动纪律，随即展开迎接“五一”生产竞赛。段内组织宣导小组，分赴各工区具体帮助，工作开始有了新的转变。抽换枕木中以往每人每天平均四根，增到八根；筛道碴由五公尺增到十公尺；捣固由十三块增到二十四块。直到红五月，义务加班近六万工时，提前完成预定计划。这一阶段，纵然因为追求数量而产生忽视质量和工友过度疲劳的偏向，但养路工作毕竟发展了一步。
    六月间，在实现管理民主化的基础上，开始推行新的养路制度和方法。即是工务负责制和路线“三检”制。前者，根据工友切身体验，认为在路线尚未彻底整修之前，需要集中力量突击的任务较多，如机械按照工作性质实行分工负责还不太适合；因此，采取在各道班所属范围内，划分小组，实行“分段负责，集体工作”的办法。但执行起来，各组为了争取模范，都报告自己负责的段路不好，希望大家先到他段去整修，很使工长为难，后来各工区建立了评议小组，根据线路的优劣程度来决定先后，问题便解决了。相继各小组，自动建立起工毕检查制，共同规定抽换枕木，必须先扎实，后打钉，并在枕木上画出自己的记号，查出不合标准，要批评，重作，好的则鼓励表扬，大大增强了工友的责任心。许多工友自备材料修理工具，有的冒雨巡查所负责的线路有无异状，查道工人赵合说：“我天天看着自己的道，就象庄稼老看着自己的庄稼一样亲，有点毛病就想给它整治整治。”在质量方面，两月余，工具节省百分之三十，螺丝松动由百分之四十，减到百分之五；道钉浮起由百分之七十，减至百分之八；并因为线路分段负责，每段需选出一个小组长，掌握全面工作，这无形中每个工区又培养着四、五个干部。路线三检制，是去东北参观的职工代表，从绥化工务段学来的经验。七月生产节约会议上，根据带来的三检草案，作了研究。大家认为如果按照“甲检”是尽一切可能条件，澈澈整修，使路线接近标准化；“乙检”进行一般整修；使行车速度，逐渐提高；“丙检”只轻微整修，维持现状等方法去做，就可克服养路工作中的盲目性。于是根据本段线路的具体情况，规定七八九三月中，以三分之一的工时，甲检路线四十公里，二分之一的工时作“乙检”，争取九月底行车速度增到八十五公里。试行结果，成绩很好，现已接近完成。有四十四年养路经验的老工友孟树椿说；“从前作活是瞎忙，现在头绪清了；老北宁时代道好，就仗人多料足，如今道好，是靠科学方法。”落垡工区工友陈福吉说：“刚做甲检时，我心里话，把火车头的一套搬到路线上用，简直是傻主意，现在一看甲检过的地方，不长草了，扎道容易了，行车也放心了，才知道这是个好主意。”
    除此，值得提出的是雨季防水和联合养路。平津线落垡至杨村间，土质不良，且靠永定、北运诸河，十年九泛，是多年以来的头痛地带。今年铁道为人民所有，主人不愿叫其再次受害。于是，雨季前对路基窄软之处，进行了打桩，铺片石，堆麻袋和必要的起道、挖沟工作，使道床排水良好。雨季中工友密切联系农民群众，在保路保田的前提下，共同防汛。河堤决口，大家便一起抢修，在持续三个月的洪水搏斗中，安全渡过险期。联合养路是解放以来的创举。七月，继秦皇岛养路成绩的鼓舞，在工务段工友带头和各站段支持下，展开业余联合养路运动，全线四千名职工、家属，清筛站内道碴。铁路医院组织现场医治组，照顾大家身体健康；有的站区组织技术指导组，保证所要求的标准质量，豆张庄、黄土坡站带动临村农民群众参加养路。至八月底共完成路线三十公里。并从联合劳动中，增进了部门与职工间的团结。这是个重要收获。
    九个月来，丰台养路工作，已呈显出崭新的面貌。它除了依靠职工的觉悟和热情外，还含有两种因素。一是密切了领导与群众的联系——特别从实现民主管理之后，段长、技术人员时常下乡指导，并按时召开工长、领工员会议，汇报工作，交流经验。一是有意识的培养了典型工区（如杨村）和典型人物（如丰台第二道班赵哲明），起了带头作用。最近工务段对养路工作作了检查总结，全体职工正为争取年节提高九十公里行车速度而努力。
