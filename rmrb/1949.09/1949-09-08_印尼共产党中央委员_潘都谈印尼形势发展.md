Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 7th: TASS, The Hague, 5th: The Dutch Communist newspaper "Truth" published a letter from Pantu, a member of the Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party, sent from Java. In the letter, Pantu reviewed the developments in the Indonesian situation over the past few months and explained that American imperialists are becoming increasingly active in Indonesia. Pantu's letter emphasized that despite all the efforts of Dutch and American imperialism, the scale of Indonesia's national liberation struggle is growing larger and larger. Pantu pointed out that last year's Madiun Uprising was merely a shameless provocation arranged by American imperialism to eliminate a large number of Indonesian democratic leaders from the political arena. American imperialism spent 65 million US dollars to prepare and carry out this provocation. According to Pantu, American imperialism and its lackeys have concentrated all their forces to deal with the People's Democratic Front. Because the People's Democratic Front bravely supports land reform, improves the living standards of the working class, and destroys feudalism, its influence is growing day by day. Pantu pointed out that the merger of the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and the Labor Party, and the formation of a unified Indonesian Communist Party, are major events in Indonesian life. Pantu then wrote that after this event, the leaders of the people's liberation movement focused their attention on strengthening the international ties of the Republic of Indonesia, mainly with the Soviet Union. The agreement on consular relations between the Republic of Indonesia and the Soviet Union signed in Prague last year was an important milestone on this road. After the merger of the three working-class parties, the Indonesian national liberation movement was raised to a new level. During this period, Communist Party leaders traveled to many cities in Java and did a great deal of work. For example, in Madiun, gatherings with speeches by Communist Party leaders Musso and Sharifuddin were attended by more than 100,000 people; in Yogyakarta, more than 35,000 people attended the gatherings. Pantu claimed that this situation greatly shocked American imperialism. In August and September of last year, many agents of the British and Americans came to Yogyakarta. It was there that they began behind-the-scenes activities, arranging provocations, bribery, and intimidation. Pantu continued that on September 18th of last year, in order to implement these provocative plans of the British and American agents, the Hatta group arrested many leaders of the Communist Party and trade unions on charges of plotting a "coup." On December 20th, Sharifuddin, Suripno, Darusman, Harino, and seven other Communist Party leaders were escorted from Solo Prison to a small village and shot. They sacrificed themselves as heroes of the Indonesian revolution. In the moment before their execution, they proudly shouted "Freedom, freedom!" repeatedly. Bakri, one of the leaders of the Socialist Youth League, shouted before being executed: "I am about to die, but I want to tell you that our country will never allow imperialism to trample on it." Pantu's letter stated that many democrats have died, but those who are still alive are continuing their cause. The Communist Party is still alive. It has learned lessons from the Madiun provocation launched by foreign imperialism with the help of Indonesian lackeys. Pantu wrote that guerrilla warfare has now spread throughout Indonesia. The Indonesian people are fighting for their complete freedom. Indonesian residents in Java and Sumatra support the guerrillas, providing them with food and clothing. Pantu concluded by writing that the so-called Hague Round Table Conference will not yield any results because there are no representatives of the Indonesian people there. The Indonesian people will win freedom through national liberation struggle, and the strength of the national liberation movement is growing day by day.

  　潘都谈印尼形势发展
    【新华社北平七日电】塔斯社海牙五日电：荷共真理报发表印尼共产党中央委员会委员潘都自爪哇寄来的一封信。潘都在该信中回顾过去数月中印尼形势的发展，并说明美国帝国主义者在印尼正越来越加活动。潘都的信强调指出：尽管有荷兰与美国帝国主义的一切努力，但印尼的民族解放斗争的规模却越来越浩大。潘都指出：去年的茉莉芬暴动，只是美帝国主义为了从政治舞台上消灭大批印尼民主领袖而安排的无耻挑衅。美帝国主义花了六千五百万美元，来准备和进行这次挑衅。据潘都称：美帝国主义及其走狗已集中他们所有的力量，来对付人民民主阵线。由于人民民主阵线勇敢地支持土地改革，改进工人阶级的生活标准及摧毁封建主义，它的影响正在一天一天扩大。潘都指出：共产党与社会党、劳工党合并，以及统一的印尼共产党的组成，是印尼生活中的重大事件。潘氏接着写道：在这一事件以后，人民解放运动领袖把他们的注意力集中在加强印尼共和国的国际联系上，主要的是与苏联的联系上。去年在布拉格签订的关于印尼共和国与苏联的领事关系的协定，是这条道路上的重要里程碑。三个工人阶级政党合并后，印尼的民族解放运动提高到了新的水平。共产党领袖在这一时期旅行了爪哇的许多城市，作了许许多多的工作。例如：茉莉芬有共产党领袖穆索与沙利佛丁讲演的集会，参加者达十万余人；在日惹出席集会的达三万五千人以上。潘都称：这种情形使得美帝国主义大为震惊。在去年八月和九月，英美的许多走卒来到日惹。他们即是在那里开始幕后活动，布置挑衅、收买与威吓等勾当。潘都继称：去年九月十八日，为了实施美英走卒的这些挑衅计划，哈达集团以阴谋“政变”的罪名逮捕了许多共产党和职工会的领袖。十二月二十日，沙利佛丁、苏利普诺、达鲁斯曼、哈利诺及其他七位共产党领袖由梭罗监狱被押解到某一小村庄中被枪毙了。他们作为印尼革命英雄而牺牲了。在他们就义前的一刻，他们仍昂然地一再呼喊着“自由，自由！”社会主义青年团领袖之一巴克利在就刑以前高喊：“我就要死了，但我要告诉你们，我们的国家决不会听任帝国主义践踏。”潘都的信称：许多民主分子都死去了，但那些还活着的人正在继续他们的事业。共产党仍然活着。它从由外国帝国主义借印尼走狗之助而发动的茉莉芬挑衅中，取得了经验教训。潘都写道：现在游击战已发展到整个印尼。印尼人民正在为争取他们的完全自由而斗争。爪哇与苏门答腊各地的印尼居民都支援游击队，供给游击队粮食和衣服等。潘都最后写道：所谓海牙圆桌会议，是不会得到任何结果的，因为那里没有印尼人民的代表。印尼人民将以民族解放斗争来赢得自由，民族解放运动的力量正在一天一天地增长。
