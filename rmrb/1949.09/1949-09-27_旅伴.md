　　Part One: Night
　　Chapter Four: Yuli
　　"How is it?" he asked, looking at Yuli.
　　"Very good!" Yuli replied with praise, walking to his desk.
　　They worked in silence. The rumbling of artillery fire shook the carriage, but they worked, not thinking about whether the night was about to end, whether the morning was about to arrive, working without rest... The doctor worked, humming softly, vaguely hearing pleasant songs, which Yuli loved to listen to...
　　Two hours later, Olga woke up and ran to call those who were resting. The first to return was Pena, as fresh as a rose, followed by the old professor.
　　"You haven't slept yet!" he said apologetically to Yuli, and began to wash his hands.
　　She didn't answer – she was counting the small squares of cloth that the young doctor was taking out of the surgical wounds, only giving Pena a look to tell her to hand the professor his surgical gown.
　　All morning, wounded soldiers were continuously brought in. The hammocks were full. Su Bao prepared three hundred breakfasts. Doctor Bilov ordered him to prepare five hundred lunches... The nurses no longer carried buckets to the bomb craters; they simply poured the bloody water onto the roadbed.
　　At noon, Danilov came to the command car and asked the commander:
　　"How is it? Is it enough?"
　　"I'm afraid it's enough," the doctor replied. "Even the command car is full. We put some on the floor, but you know, that might be punishable."
　　They walked through the train. It was crowded, filled with the smell of medicine and sweat, and flies were buzzing. Many lightly wounded people came on their own and stayed on the train, hoping for a chance to leave the city. Most of them were residents. A woman with a wounded scapula brought four children; Pena squeezed them into her room. These actions were all against the rules, but somehow that night everyone forgot the rules, only remembering the common Russian disaster, and that they should work together to escape from this disaster.
　　The doctor looked at every bunk, he didn't know how many times he had looked! He kept thinking: perhaps Igor would suddenly be here. But Igor was not there.
　　"Comrade Danilov," the doctor said. "You'd better lie down for a while, good friend. You've been working like a coolie all night, that won't do."
　　The doctor himself hadn't slept, running around, arranging the wounded, putting out fires, and had nothing to eat except for a glass of vodka that Kratsov poured for him. But the doctor felt that he was the only one not working, and this glass of gloating vodka seemed to him like a huge crime violating official duty and ethics. Let Danilov not know about this drink...
　　"I was thinking," Danilov said, "that there are several train cars full of valuables left at the station here. They're going to burn them. We could very well tow a train car away."
　　"How to tow it away?"
　　"What do you mean how? Use our locomotive to tow it. Hitch it onto our train. I've already talked to the station commander, and he's very willing."
　　Danilov thought the doctor would be very happy. But the doctor looked at him, his tired eyes flashing, and did not rush to answer him.
　　"Danilov, I'm sorry," he finally said. "But, I don't think we can solve this problem lightly. You have to understand, I am first and foremost a doctor, and I am responsible for the lives of the patients. If this additional load affects the speed of the train, I will be forced to refuse..."
　　He spoke very kindly, but in his flashing eyes, Danilov understood: the commander felt like a commander. Danilov's face turned red, and he thought, "You are not only a doctor, but also a Soviet citizen, you should save the country's property!" But the doctor seemed to be reminding him:
　　"You know, property can be compensated. And what our train is carrying is the most valuable, isn't it?"
　　Yuli walked towards them, standing tall, with a triumphant expression, but her face was not as rosy as usual. There was still a dried bloodstain on her temple.
　　The doctor saluted her. She bowed modestly and walked past.
　　"And this one," the doctor said, looking at her back, "is probably the most precious person on our train."
　　"Who brought her here?" Danilov thought. "I brought her here! When you came, everything was prepared perfectly, and now you're giving orders!"
　　But, he remembered that this was the battlefield, and in front of him was the commander of his unit. So he didn't say anything.

    第一部　夜
    第四章　尤丽
    “怎么样？”他瞧着尤丽问着。
    “很好！”尤丽称赞的回答着，走到他的桌子跟前。
    他俩默然的工作着。隆隆的炮声，把车厢震得抖颤着，可是他们在工作着，不曾想到夜是不是快完了，早晨是不是快到了，休息不休……医生工作着，低声儿啸着，恍恍惚惚听见入耳中听的歌声，尤丽很爱听……
    过两小时，娥尔加醒了，她跳起来，就跑去叫那些休息的人。头一个回来的是裴娜，新鲜得象一朵玫瑰花似的，其次是老教授。
    “你们还没睡觉！”他抱歉的对尤丽说着，就洗起手来。
    她没回答——她在数着青年医生从开刀的伤口里取出来的小方巾，只对裴娜使了一个眼色，叫她把衣罩递给教授。
    整个的早晨，都不断的有伤兵运来。吊床都满了。苏葆预备了三百份早餐。比洛夫医生吩咐他预备五百份午餐……护士们已经不再提着桶往弹坑里去了，她们简直就把血水倒到路基上。
    中午的时候，达尼洛夫来到司令车里，问司令道：
    “怎么样？够了吗？”
    “恐怕够了，”医生回答着。“连司令车上都是满满的。我们放些到地板上，可是你晓得，这可能要受处分的。”
    他们由列车里走着。车里挤得满满的，发着药房的气味和汗臭气，苍蝇在飞着。有许多轻伤的，他们自己走来，就留到车上，好等机会离开这城市。他们大多数都是居民。一个肩甲骨受伤的女子，带了四个孩子；裴娜把他们挤到自己房间里了。这些举动都是犯规的，可是这夜不知怎的都把规则忘记了，只记得俄罗斯的共同的灾害，应当共同努力从这灾害里逃出来吧。
    医生到每张铺上看着，他不知看了多少次呵！他总在想着：或许伊戈尔会突然在这儿呢。可是没有伊戈尔。
    “达尼洛夫同志，”医生说。“你最好躺一躺，好朋友，你好象苦力似的整夜工作着，这样不行的。”
    医生自己也没睡觉，奔跑着，安排着伤兵，救火，除了克拉错夫给他倒的一杯白干以外，什么也没入口。可是医生觉得就他一个人没作事，这杯幸灾乐祸的白干，在他看来，简直是违犯公务和伦理的天大的罪行。就让达尼洛夫不晓得这杯酒……
    “我想，”达尼洛夫说：“这里的车站上有好几列车贵重东西扔在这儿。要把这些烧掉的。我们很可以拖一列车带走。”
    “怎么拖走呢？”
    “怎么，用咱们的车头拖。把它挂在咱们的车上。我已经同车站司令谈过，他很乐意。”
    达尼洛夫想着医生一定很高兴的。可是医生望着他，疲惫的眼睛在闪着，没有急着回答他。
    “达尼洛夫，对不起，”他终于说了。“可是，我觉得这问题我们不能轻率的来解决。你要明白，我首先是一个医生，病人的性命我要负责的。如果这附加的载重量影响了行车的速度，我迫不得已，只有不答应了…”
    他非常和气的说着，可是在他那闪灼的眼睛里，达尼洛夫明白：司令觉得自己是司令了。达尼洛夫的脸红起来，他想道：“你不但是位医生，而且是苏联公民，你应当救国家的财产！”可是医生仿佛在提醒他似的说道：
    “你晓得，财产我们可以补偿。而且我们列车所载的是最有价值的呢，不是吗？”
    尤丽迎面走来，她挺着身子，带着胜利的神情，只是容颜没有平常那么红润。她的太阳穴上，还留着一道干了的血迹。
    医生向她行着礼。她谦逊的鞠了一躬，就走过去了。
    “而这一位，”医生望着她背后说，“大概是咱们这列车上最宝贵的人了。”
    “谁把她找来的呢？”达尼洛夫想着，“我把她找来的！你来的时候，一切都预备得现现成成的了，而现在你命令起来了！”
    可是，他想起来这是在战场上，而且在他面前的是他这部分的司令。他也就没说什么了。
