　　Preface

　　Today, we are pleased to celebrate the centenary of the birth of the great Soviet scientist Pavlov. In the Soviet Union, starting from the 20th of this month, the State Bureau for the Dissemination of Political and Scientific Knowledge has been disseminating Pavlov's scientific contributions and his spirit of patriotism throughout the country. Scientists from all over the world have also been invited to Moscow to hold a grand memorial meeting. The Chinese scientific community was invited to send Pan Shu, Director of the Psychology Department of Nanjing University, Feng Depei, Acting Director of the Institute of Medicine of the Central Research Institute during the Kuomintang era, and Ji Zhongpu, President of Harbin Medical University. This demonstrates the people's government's emphasis on science, as well as the people's lofty respect and eternal remembrance of scientists.

　　The preparatory committee of the All-China Federation of Sino-Soviet Friendship Associations and the preparatory committee of the First Congress of the All-China Association of Natural Science Workers, in order to strengthen cultural exchanges between China and the Soviet Union, and because Pavlov's theory has had a tremendous impact on the research work in physiology, psychology, medicine, and education in our country, specially held a grand memorial meeting in the auditorium of Peking Union Medical College today. At the same time, a special memorial publication is being published to express our respect for Pavlov.

　　In the short few days since the launch of this publication, many memorial articles have been received from various parties. Although each person's understanding is not entirely the same, and the starting point of their impressions is not completely consistent, there is a unanimous admiration and respect for Pavlov's epoch-making contributions. And the conclusion that scientific research can only be developed in a country where the people are in charge is also generally consistent. The Chinese people are beginning to conduct great scientific experiments in social undertakings. On August 17, 1935, Pavlov once said this at Molotov's reception of representatives of the International Physiological Society in the Kremlin: "You have all heard and seen the position that science occupies in our country. The relationship between our government and the scientific community can be explained by one thing: that is, the only fear of those of us who preside over research institutions is the constant fear of failing to live up to the government's provision of all conveniences for our work. You all know that I am a pure experimentalist, and our government is an even more advanced experimenter. I earnestly hope to live long enough to see the success of this great socialist experiment." Then, today, when we commemorate Pavlov, it will be a greater encouragement and excitement for Chinese scientific workers. (Ding Zan)

　　前言
    今天欣逢苏联伟大科学家巴夫洛夫诞生百周年纪念。在苏联，从本月二十号起便由国家政治科学知识传播局在各地传播巴氏的科学贡献和他的爱国主义的精神。并且邀集了世界各国科学家在莫斯科举行盛大的纪念会。—我国科学界应邀前往的有南京大学心理系主任潘菽，国民党时代中央研究院医学研究所代所长冯德培和哈尔滨医科大学校长季钟璞。这表示了人民政权对于科学的重视，也表示了人民对于科学家的崇高的敬意和永恒的怀念。
    中苏友好协会全国总会筹备会和中华全国自然科学工作者第一次代表大会筹备委员会为了加强中苏两国文化的交流，也为了巴氏学说对于我国生理学，心理学，医学和教育学各方面研究工作曾经发生过巨大的影响，所以特于今天借协和医学院礼堂举行隆重的纪念会，同时在此发刊纪念特刊来表示我们对于巴氏的崇敬。
    在发起本刊的短短几天内，竟收到各方纪念文字多篇，尽管各人的认识不尽相同，而观感的出发点也不完全一致，但是，对于巴氏学说的划时代的贡献，却是一致的推崇和一致的景仰。而科学研究的只有在人民当家的国家里才能得到发展这一点，也庶乎是一致的结论。中国人民正在开始进行伟大的社会事业的科学试验。一九三五年八月十七日克林姆宫中莫洛托夫招待国际生理学会的代表时巴夫洛夫曾经这样说过：“你们都已听到和看到科学在我国所占的地位。我们的政府和科学界的关系，可以用一件事来说明：那就是我们主持研究机构的人的唯一恐惧，就是时时害怕辜负政府给予我们一切工作上的便利。诸位都知道我是一个纯粹的实验家，我们的政府也是一个实验者，不过是更为高级的罢了。我切望再活下去，以致能看到这个伟大的社会主义实验的成功”。那末，今天我们来纪念巴氏，这对于中国的科学工作者将感到更大的鼓舞和兴奋。 （丁瓒）
