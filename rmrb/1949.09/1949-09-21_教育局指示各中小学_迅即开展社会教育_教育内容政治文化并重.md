　　Bureau of Education Directs All Primary and Secondary Schools to Swiftly Launch Social Education; Education Content Emphasizes Both Politics and Culture
　　[Our Newspaper] The Ping City People's Government Bureau of Education issued instructions on the 18th to all municipal and private secondary schools, and to the cultural and educational sections of each district and municipal central primary schools, requiring everyone to take action and undertake the task of social education. It stipulates that the cultural and educational sections in urban areas should focus on developing adult education as the central task for the next two months; suburban areas should spend the next month preparing for the launch of winter schools after the following month. Municipal primary and secondary schools should generally attach adult night schools or children's supplementary schools. Secondary schools can generally focus on running adult night schools, and primary schools can run children's supplementary schools. Regarding the teacher problem, staff and students should be mobilized to take on the responsibility, and not all be placed on the shoulders of the school's teachers. The educational task of adult classes lies in eliminating illiteracy and raising the masses' political awareness, with equal emphasis on supplementing culture and studying current affairs and politics. The target audience is scattered independent laborers, peddlers, shop assistants, and secondarily, a portion of citizens (worker education is already being handled uniformly by the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions). The teaching content of children's classes is basically consistent with ordinary primary schools, so that children can transfer to ordinary primary schools when opportunities arise; the main target is the children of the working people, and if conditions permit, general children can also be admitted. In addition, the instructions also made specific provisions regarding funding, leadership relations, teaching materials, and the school system, curriculum, and teaching time of children's supplementary schools. The Bureau of Education also uniformly compiled and printed literacy textbooks for adult night schools and textbooks for the first and second grades of children's supplementary schools. The instructions finally requested that all schools launch social education as soon as possible, without waiting. If there are difficulties or constructive suggestions, they can be reported to the Bureau of Education at any time.
　　[Our Newspaper] The Social Education Section of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Education yesterday (the 20th) at 2 p.m. invited relevant units from the Propaganda Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, the Municipal Women's Federation, the Joint Association of Primary and Secondary School Teachers, and the Municipal Federation of Students to discuss the issue of developing adult education. During the meeting, preliminary exchanges of views were made on the establishment of adult education, unified organization and leadership, and teaching content. Everyone unanimously agreed that in addition to the cultural and educational sections in urban and suburban areas being responsible for developing adult education, general primary and secondary schools and institutions should also attach adult supplementary classes. The courses for adult education should be undertaken by mobilizing staff and students, and not all be placed on the shoulders of the school's teachers. Regarding the teaching content, it was agreed that equal emphasis should be placed on culture and politics, and it was decided to establish a unified organization for adult education including the above six units next week.
