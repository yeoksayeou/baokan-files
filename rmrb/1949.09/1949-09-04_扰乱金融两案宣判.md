　　[This Municipality News] The Municipal People's Court recently announced sentences in two cases of illegal financial disruption: (1) Zhang Ruiming, a peddler traveling between Ping (Beiping) and Shanghai, colluded with Li Haiting, the manager of Yonggu Zhai antique shop outside Chongwen Gate in this city, to purchase over a hundred copper-inlaid stone ashtrays, cigarette cases, etc., and concealed 251 silver dollars within the tobacco products, attempting to transport them to Shanghai for illegal profit. He was apprehended at the railway station. The principal offender, Zhang Ruiming, is in Shanghai and will be dealt with separately upon arrival. The silver dollars and the tobacco products used to conceal them are confiscated. Li Haiting, for assisting in the smuggling of silver dollars, is fined 125,000 yuan, equivalent to the value of the smuggled silver dollars. Long Wenqi, a shop assistant at Yonggu Zhai, who assisted in delivering the silver dollars to the station under the manager's instructions, was given education and ordered to publish a self-criticism in the newspaper. (2) Liu Dehui, manager of Taihe Grain Shop at 98 Yanshou Temple in this city, privately borrowed loans to engage in illegal money-lending activities. He accepted a deposit of 300,000 yuan from Li Yiheng, manager of Jiu Ji Knitting Factory at 51 Langfang Toutiao, at an interest rate of 18 yuan per thousand. Li Yiheng also introduced Guo Tingzhai, a worker at the factory, to lend 5,000 yuan in Renminbi to Su Jingting, manager of Juchengquan Restaurant at 10 Xisi Mazhuang, at a daily interest rate of 20 yuan. The court, based on the "Provisional Measures for the Administration of Private Money Shops in the North China Region" and the Municipal People's Government's Order No. 127 on Criminal Trials, sentenced Taihe Grain Shop to a three-day suspension of business and a fine of 200,000 yuan.
