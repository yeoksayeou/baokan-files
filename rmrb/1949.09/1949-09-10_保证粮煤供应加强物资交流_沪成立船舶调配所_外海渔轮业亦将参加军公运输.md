　　Guarantee Grain and Coal Supply, Strengthen Material Exchange
  　Shanghai Establishes Shipping Dispatch Office
    Offshore Fishing Fleets Will Also Participate in Military and Public Transportation
    [Our Newspaper Shanghai, 9th Dispatch] In order to smash the enemy's blockade and strengthen the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, Shanghai's water and land transportation business with various places has gradually recovered. The area of cargo circulation is expanding daily. So far, there are major cities such as Ping, Tianjin, Han, Ji, Xu, Beng, Zheng, Xi'an, and Lanzhou. In addition to the resumption of direct freight trains from Ping to Shanghai on land, private ships have recently opened up new inland river routes. Trial voyages directly to Lianyungang and Bengbu have been successful. In order to uniformly dispatch and centrally manage ships, guarantee the supply of grain and coal to Shanghai, and support the front lines, the Shipping Administration has established a Shipping Dispatch Office. All levels of passenger and cargo ships, tugboats, iron barges, motorized barges, sailboats, and wooden boats must register with the office and undertake the transportation business assigned by the office. Under the promotion of the Shipping Guidance Committee of the Shipping Administration, private ships have been organized successively, and the Tugboat and Iron Barge Joint Management Office, the Yangtze River Shipping Joint Management Office, and the Inland River Steamboat Industry Joint Management Preparatory Office have been established. Recently, it is mobilizing to organize private wooden boats and inland river barges. More than 20,000 tons have been organized internally. Due to the enemy's blockade, the offshore fishing fleet cannot go out to sea to fish. In order to solve the difficulties encountered by the crew after the fishing boats are docked, the Shipping Guidance Committee is investigating the performance, sailing routes, deadweight tonnage, and transportation costs of all fishing boats, and is also preparing to organize them to participate in military and public transportation, which is expected to reach 10,000 tons. In the future, with the active support of the government and the direct leadership of the Shipping Administration, the transportation business will be greatly strengthened and will play a significant role in strengthening urban-rural trade and smashing the enemy's blockade.

　　保证粮煤供应加强物资交流
  　沪成立船舶调配所
    外海渔轮业亦将参加军公运输
    【本报记者上海九日专电】为了粉碎敌人封锁，加强城乡物资交流，上海与各地的水陆运输业务渐渐恢复，货物流通地区日广，至目前止，已有平、津、汉、济、徐、蚌、郑、西安、兰州等大城市，除陆上恢复平沪直达货车以外，私营船舶最近更开辟了内河新航线，直达连云港及蚌埠的试航业已成功。为了统一调配、集中管理船舶，保证供应上海粮煤、支援前线，航运处特成立船舶调配所，凡各级客货轮船、拖轮、铁驳机、帆船、木船，均需向该所登记，并应承担该所支配的运输业务，私营船舶在航运处航业指导委员会推动下，已相继组织起来，先后成立了拖轮、铁驳联营处，长江航运联营处，内河汽船业联营筹备处。最近正动员组织私营木船和内河轮驳，内组织起来的已有二万多吨，外海渔轮业因敌人封锁，不能出海打渔，为了解决渔轮停泊后船员所遭遇的困难，航业指导委员会正在调查所有渔轮性能、行驶航线、载重量及运输成本等，也准备组织起来参加军公运输，预计可达一万吨。今后在政府的积极扶助与航运处直接领导下，运输业务将大大加强，在加强城乡贸易，粉碎敌人封锁中，将起很大的作用。
