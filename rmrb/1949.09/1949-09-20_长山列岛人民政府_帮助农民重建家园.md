　　Changshan Islands People's Government
  　Helps Farmers Rebuild Their Homes
    [This News Agency reported] According to Shanghai Dagong Bao: Since the Changshan Islands were recovered by our army, under the leadership and assistance of the People's Government, and with the voluntary mutual assistance and mutual relief of the masses, the island's residents have actively reclaimed wasteland, applied fertilizer, rebuilt their homes, and strived to harvest more grain in the autumn.
    During the twenty-two months of enemy rule in the Changshan Islands, except for a few patches of less weedy crops that could be seen at the entrances of villages, the land across the mountains and fields was barren. Moreover, due to the counter-settlements by landlords and local bullies who returned to the island with the Kuomintang bandit army, the land distributed to poor farmers during the land reform was all snatched back. The lives of the farmers were extremely hard. When the staff of the island's People's Government led them to engage in production, the masses still had many difficulties and concerns. Some said, "How can we work when we are hungry?" Others harbored thoughts of a change in the political situation, hindering the progress of production work. In light of this ideological situation, the staff first convened large and small meetings, village meetings, and meetings of hired and poor farmers among the masses in each village, repeatedly publicizing the current situation in which the entire country is about to achieve complete victory. At the same time, the People's Government allocated 360,000 catties of relief grain to aid the families of district and village cadres who were killed by the Kuomintang, as well as poor and middle peasants. It also organized villages to carry out mutual assistance and mutual relief on a voluntary basis,投入in production, and eliminate wasteland. Men and women, young and old, in each village went to the mountains to pull grass, clear seedlings, and rush to hoe. The men and women of Quetui Village in Yushi Township, on the one hand, loaded and unloaded military grain and military grass at the码头dock, and at the same time, fertilized 400 mu of land in the village, and hoed 300 mu of crops. To prevent rain, they also picked up the grass. In Beidian Village, Miaodao Township, more than 1,200 mu of the 1,600 mu of land were hoeed in seven days, and 530 mu were hoeed twice. Fu Peisheng, a 74-year-old blind man, also went to the field to pull grass. Lin Han's mother, who is in her sixties, pulled grass on three mu of land in seven days. The Changshan Islands saw the successive emergence of green seedling fields amidst such a high tide of labor enthusiasm.

　　长山列岛人民政府
  　帮助农民重建家园
    【本报讯】据上海大公报载：长山列岛自经我军收复后，该岛居民在人民政府领导帮助及群众的自愿互助互济下，积极垦荒、施肥，重建家园，争取秋天多打粮食。
    长山列岛在敌人统治的二十二个月中，各岛除村头上可看出几块荒草较少的庄稼外，满山遍野的土地都荒成一片；更由于随着国民党匪军回岛的地主恶霸的倒算，土地改革时贫苦农民分到的土地，全都被抢夺回去。农民生活极苦。当该岛人民政府工作人员领导他们进行生产时，群众尚有不少困难和顾虑，有的说：“肚子饿还能干活吗？”还有的存着变天思想，阻碍生产工作的开展。工作人员根据这一思想情况，首先在各村群众中召开大会、小会、村民会、雇贫农会、反复的宣传了目前全国即将全部胜利的形势。同时人民政府拨发救济粮三十六万斤，救济被国民党杀害的区村干部家属及雇贫中农。并组织各村在自愿原则下，进行互助互济，投入生产，消灭荒地，各村男女老幼都到山里拔草、清苗、抢锄。玉石乡鹊嘴村的男女，一方面在码头上装卸军粮、军草，同时把该村四百亩地施上粪，三百亩庄稼也锄过一遍，为防天下雨，并把草都拾出来。庙岛乡北店村，一千六百多亩地，七天的工夫锄了一千二百多亩，并有五百三十亩锄过两遍。七十四岁双眼瞎的傅培盛，也到地里去拔草，林汉的母亲六十多岁，七天拔了三亩地的草。长山列岛就在这种高涨的劳动热情下次第出现了青青的苗田。
