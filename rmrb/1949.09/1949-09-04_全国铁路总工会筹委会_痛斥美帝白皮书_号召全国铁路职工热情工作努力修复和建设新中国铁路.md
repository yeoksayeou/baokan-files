　　National Railway Workers' Union Preparatory Committee
  　Vigorously Denounces the U.S. Imperialist White Paper
  　Calls on Railway Workers Nationwide to Work Enthusiastically to Repair and Build the New China's Railways
    [This Dispatch] The Preparatory Committee of the All-China Railway Workers' Union issued a statement on the second of this month, vigorously denouncing the U.S. imperialist White Paper. The statement stated: In the White Paper published by the U.S. imperialists, we see more clearly that all past activities of the U.S. imperialists in China were nothing more than to weaken and eliminate the patriotic democratic forces led by Chairman Mao of the Chinese Communist Party, and to eliminate China's patriotic democratic revolutionary movement, in order to turn China into a colony of the U.S. imperialists. We railway workers have personally experienced this disaster and feel it acutely. Many locomotives and vehicles, many railway bridges, and many station buildings were all destroyed by the airplanes and cannons supplied by the U.S. imperialists to the Kuomintang bandit gang; many railway workers also died tragically under the bombing of the airplanes and cannons supplied by the U.S. imperialists to the Kuomintang bandit gang. We will never forget this blood feud! In the U.S. imperialist White Paper, they try to sow discord between China and the Soviet Union, and incite so-called "democratic individualists" to organize anti-communism. We express our solemn opposition. We call on railway workers across the country to heighten their vigilance against U.S. imperialism, use high labor enthusiasm, and work hard to repair and build the people's railways of New China, adapt to the needs of the People's Liberation Army's advance, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely eliminate the remnant forces of the Kuomintang that the U.S. imperialists continue to support, and develop production, prosper the economy, and build a new China.

　　全国铁路总工会筹委会
  　痛斥美帝白皮书
  　号召全国铁路职工热情工作努力修复和建设新中国铁路
    【本报讯】中华全国铁路总工会筹备委员会于本月二日，发表声明，痛斥美帝白皮书。声明略称：在美帝公布的白皮书中，使我们更清楚地看到：美帝过去在中国的一切活动，无非是为了削弱和消灭中国共产党毛主席所领导的爱国民主力量，消灭中国的爱国民主革命运动，以便把中国变为美帝的殖民地。我们铁路工人身受这种灾难，尤有切肤之痛。许多机车车辆，许多铁路桥梁，许多车站建筑，都是美帝供给国民党匪帮的飞机大炮炸毁的；许多铁路工人也都是在美帝供给国民党匪帮的飞机大炮轰炸下惨死的。这种血海深仇，我们永远也不会忘记！在美帝白皮书中，挑拨中苏两国的友谊，鼓动所谓“民主个人主义”者组织反共。我们表示严正的反对。我们号召全国铁路职工，提高对美帝的警惕，用高度的劳动热情，努力修复和建设新中国的人民铁路，适应人民解放军的进军需要，彻底、干净、全部消灭美帝所继续支持的国民党残余力量，并发展生产，繁荣经济，建设新中国。
