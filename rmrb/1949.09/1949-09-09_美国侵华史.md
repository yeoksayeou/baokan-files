　　II. Gradually Moving Towards Independent Aggression Against China (Continued XI)

　　After the Nanjing government collapsed, many upper-class figures in the South were still engaged in fierce struggles for power and profit with Yuan Shikai. Yuan Shikai had to use a large amount of "reconstruction" funds to eliminate dissenting forces. The United States also wanted to obtain new benefits from Yuan Shikai. Thus, the old broker Tang Shaoyi (who was then the "Prime Minister" of Yuan's government) came out again to negotiate a loan with the four-nation banking consortium originally initiated by the United States. However, in view of past failures, the United States had to consider that such blatant "political" loans would be difficult to achieve without the participation of Japan and Russia. Therefore, the four countries jointly invited Japan and Russia to join this banking consortium. After Japan and Russia proposed the "excluding Manchuria and Mongolia" condition, they successively joined, and the four-nation banking consortium initiated and organized by the United States was transformed into a six-nation consortium. After many surprising tricks, a huge loan of 25 million pounds—the famous "Reorganization Loan" in modern Chinese history—was finally agreed upon in the spring of 1913. The main conditions demanded by the imperialists were: (1) The six-nation banking consortium would send representatives to supervise the use of the loan. These representatives were called "associate foreign personnel"; (2) The salt tax guaranteeing the loan would be implemented by a special tax authority established by the six-nation banking consortium; (3) During the period of this loan, China was not allowed to borrow from any banking consortium other than the six countries (Note: Reorganization Loan Contract, see Oriental Magazine, Vol. 9, No. 12). They also prepared to use force as a backing for the implementation of these conditions. In 1913, the ministers of the six countries in Beijing held a meeting on the large loan, and one of the resolutions was: "If China cannot implement the supervisory power mentioned in the terms of the large loan, the six countries must intervene with national power." (Note: YUAN Sheng's Posthumous Works, Vol. 1, p. 27.) The establishment of the six-nation banking consortium was a temporary compromise to some extent among a group of foreign aggressors in China. The United States and Japan each had their own special intentions. The United States was playing the old trick of exploiting other countries to obtain practical benefits. Japan was seizing the opportunity to win over Yuan Shikai and prepare for a larger-scale offensive against China.

　　The political role of the six-nation banking consortium in China was so dark, and the same was true in the economic field. Although the loan amount written on the contract was 25 million pounds, after the bankers and creditors deducted 16 percent of the profits first, only 84 percent—21 million pounds—remained. Then, the paying countries deducted more than 12.7 million pounds for various overdue reparations and advances. The final figure Yuan Shikai received was 8.2 million pounds, or 33 percent (Note: The Times, 6th Year, Issue 29). This 25 million pounds in real terms had to be extorted from the Chinese people by Yuan Shikai through various cruel methods and sent to the pockets of foreign capitalists headed by the United States!

　　But things took another turn. On March 4, 1913, the final list of financial supervisors decided by the six countries did not include the United States and Japan. Japan quickly asked the other countries to help it obtain a seat as "advisor" in Yuan Shikai's other institutions as compensation. Only the United States was left empty-handed. This was completely contrary to its original intention of initiating the banking consortium, and it was a decisive issue. Because the United States lost the supervisor, it lost control over China. This not only made it difficult to achieve the original purpose of involving the powers in deeper aggression against China, but also gave other countries a more advantageous position. How unfavorable this was to the United States! To change this situation, it was only possible to destroy the banking consortium that it had organized with its own hands. Taking advantage of the opportunity of Woodrow Wilson's new presidency, the US government announced its withdrawal from the six-nation banking consortium on March 20. The reasons listed in the declaration were, of course, not to say that the US plan to invade China had failed again, but to solemnly declare:

　　"The loan is close to interfering with China's administrative independence... It is contrary to the founding principles of the United States, and this government is unwilling to bear this responsibility." (Note: Oriental Magazine, Vol. 9, No. 12.)

　　This set of complete nonsense still hoped that the Chinese people would believe it. However, due to the contradictions between the United States and Japan, the Japanese rudely exposed the US imperialist plot. The Japan Diplomatic Times commented on this: "The United States' policy towards China has always been based on the key to wielding the sword of justice in the left hand and the key to interests in the right hand." "Where they call for justice and hang up the banner of humanity, there must be interests hidden..." (Note: Ibid., Vol. 9, No. 11), which perfectly exposed this nonsense.

　　The United States' withdrawal from the banking consortium did not cause the other five countries to disband. It further advised Yuan Shikai through the US Minister to Beijing to abandon the large loan plan and make more small loans, saying that "it is most appropriate for China to adopt this method" (Note: Yuan Sheng's Posthumous Works, Vol. 2, p. 50), wanting to achieve the goal of destroying the banking consortium in this way. At this time, Yuan Shikai was not under the sole control of the United States, so the advice naturally had no effect. Thus, the US banking consortium plan, from beginning to end, completely failed again.

　　Japan seized this opportunity to intensify its expansion of its power in China. Especially after the outbreak of the European War in 1914, the Western powers had no time to look east. On January 18, 1915, Japan presented Yuan Shikai with the Twenty-One Demands to monopolize China. This was a major blow to the United States. The United States deeply knew that it did not have the strength to stop Japan's major offensive, so it abandoned the approach of direct confrontation with Japan since the "Knox Plan" and returned to the old path of cooperation with Japan. US Minister to Beijing, Reinsch, asked President Wilson to "pay attention" to the pressure exerted by Japan on Yuan Shikai. On February 8, Wilson wrote a letter to Reinsch saying: "I feel that any direct advice or direct intervention to China in the current negotiations will do more harm than good and will arouse Japanese suspicion and hostility..." (Note: Wang Yunsheng's Previous Book, Vol. 6, p. 330), which told him that the US position was to stand on Japan's side. During the Japanese-Yuan negotiations, the United States, together with Britain, advised Japan to abandon "Group Five" of the Twenty-One Demands (i.e., hiring Japanese military, political, and financial advisors, and establishing joint Chinese-Japanese police and arsenals), so that Yuan Shikai could continue to rule in China (Note: Yang Liqiao translated, Memoirs of US Missionary Paxonford, "I heard that Japan, for the sake of friendship, has abandoned part of the demands of the Twenty-One Demands at the joint request of the United States and Britain!" Also, the former book of British journalist Donald Yun, the Twenty-One Demands were personally handed over to Yuan Shikai by Japanese Minister Hioki Eki, and threatened Yuan that if the contents of the demands were leaked, it would cause a Chinese revolution and overthrow him; Wang's Previous Book, Vol. 6, pp. 382-383), and advised Yuan Shikai to "tolerate and compromise with each other" (Note: Wang's Previous Book, p. 320), all of which were actions of cooperation with Japan.

　　美国侵华史
    刘大年
  　二　逐渐走向独立侵略中国　（续十一）
    南京政府瓦解后，南方许多上层人物还在与袁世凯从事激烈的争权夺利斗争，袁世凯不得不要大批“善后”费用来排除异己势力，美国也正想从袁世凯手中取得新的利益，如是老经纪人唐绍仪（这时为袁政府的“国务总理”）又出来与原由美国发起的四国银行团接洽一笔借款。但鉴于以往的失败，使美国不能不顾虑此种明目张胆的“政治”借款，没有日本和俄国加入，将难实现，因此由四国共同邀请日俄两国也加入这个银行团。日俄提出“满蒙除外”条件后，相继参加，美国所发起组织的四国银行团遂一变而为六国团了。经过许多出奇的花样，终于一九一三年春天，一个二千五百万英镑的巨额借款——中国近代史上有名的“善后大借款”，得到了协议。帝国主义者们所要的条件主要有：（一）由六国银团派代表监督借款用途，这种代表称为“协理洋员”；（二）担保借款的盐税，由六国银团设立特别税务机关执行；（三）中国在此借款期间，不许向六国以外的任何银行团借款（注：善后借款合同，载东方杂志，九卷十二号）。它们并准备以武力为执行这些条件的后盾，一九一三年六国驻北京公使举行关于大借款的会议，其决议中有一项是：“大借款条件所言监督权，如中国不能实行，则六国须以国力干涉。”（注：远生遗著，一卷，二七页。）六国银行团的成立，是一群外国侵略者在中国某种程度的暂时妥协。美日两国又各有其特殊用意，美国是玩弄利用别国故智，取得现实利益；日本是抓紧机会争取袁世凯，作更大规模向中国进攻的准备。
    六国银行团对中国所发生的政治作用是如此黑暗，在经济方面也是同样。合同上写着的借款额虽是二千五百万镑，首先经过银行家和债权人扣除百分之十六的利益，只剩下百分之八十四——二千一百万镑了，又再由付款国扣除各种名义的到期赔款，垫款等等一千二百七十余万镑，袁世凯最后所得到的数字是八百二十万镑，即百分之三十三（注：时代，第六年二九期）。这个二千五百万英镑实数却要经过袁世凯的手，用各种残酷方法从中国人民身上敲榨出来，送到以美国为首的外国资本家钱袋里去！
    但事情又发生了波折。一九一三年三月四日六国最后所表决的财政监督官中，没有美日两国名额——日本迅速请各国帮助在袁世凯其他机关中获得一席“顾问”作补偿，只有美国是最后落空了。这完全与它发起银行团的初愿相反，而又是一个有决定性的问题，因为美国失掉监督官，就是失掉了对中国的控制权，这不仅难以达到当初援引列强深入侵略中国的目的，反因此给了别国更优越的位置，对美国这是如何不利的形势！要转变此种形势，就只有把由它自己一手组织起来的银行团，再由它去一手破坏才有可能，美国政府乘威尔逊（Ｗｏｏｄｒｏｗ　Ｗｉｌｓｏｎ）新上台的机会，于三月二十日又宣告退出六国银行团，宣言中所列举的理由，当然不是说美国侵略中国的计划又失败了，而是堂哉皇哉地声明：
    “该借款近于干涉中国行政之独立……有背吾美立国主义，本政府不愿负此责任。”（注：东方杂志，九卷一二号。）
    这套十足的鬼话，竟还希望中国人民去相信它，但是由于美日的矛盾，使日本人不客气的来揭露了美国帝国主义的鬼计。日本外交时报对此评论说：“美国对中国之政策，向以左手执正义之剑，右手操利害关系之键为要诀”，“彼等呼号正义，悬挂人道牌号之处，必伏有利益……”（注：同前，九卷一一号），正好把这鬼话揭穿。
    美国从银行团退出，并未使其他五国拆散，它又进一步由驻北京美国公使劝告袁世凯放弃大借款计划，多作小借款，说是“中国以采用此法为最宜”（注：远生遗著，二卷，五○页），想这样来达到破坏银行团的目的。这时袁世凯既不属美国单独支配，劝告自然没有效果。至是，美国的银行团计划，从头至尾，又完全败北。
    日本正好乘此机会加紧扩张它在中国的势力，尤其一九一四年欧洲大战爆发，西方列强已无暇东顾，日本乃于一九一五年一月十八日向袁世凯提出独占中国的二十一条。这对美国是个很大打击，美国深知它本身还没有力量阻止日本这样的大举进攻，遂放弃从“诺克斯计划”以来与日本正面冲突的作法，返回到和日本合作的老路上去。美驻北京公使芮茵斯曾请总统威尔逊对日本施与袁世凯的压力加以“注意”，二月八日威尔逊给芮茵斯一函说：“余感觉对于现在之交涉，予中国以任何直接劝告，或任何直接干涉，均属害多益少，且将惹起日方之猜忌及敌意……”（注：王芸生前书，六卷，三三○页），这告诉他美国的立场是要站在日本一边的。日袁谈判中，美国既联合英国劝告日本把二十一条中的“第五号”（即聘用日本军、政、财顾问，中日合办警察，军械所等）放弃，让袁世凯在中国继续统治得下去（注：杨历樵译，美教士班煦福回忆录有：“余闻日本为友谊计，已从美英联名请求，将二十一条一部分要求放弃矣！”又前书英记者道纳云，二十一条系由日本公使日置益亲交袁世凯，并恫吓袁云：倘泄漏要求内容，即将引起中国革命，将他推翻；载王前书，六卷，三八二—三八三页），又劝告袁世凯“相忍相让”（注：王前书，三二○页），这都是与日本合作的行动。
