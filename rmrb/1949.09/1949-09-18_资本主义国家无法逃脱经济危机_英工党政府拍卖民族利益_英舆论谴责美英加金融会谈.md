Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 16th: A Reuter dispatch from London on the 13th reports that the agreement reached between Bevin, Cripps, and Washington opens the door to Britain and the British Empire for American capital to invade. This is considered by a broad spectrum of the British people as a shameful auction to the gold standard emperor. The ultimate result of the agreement is likely to be the destruction of British national industries due to American companies establishing factories and competing within British territory.

　　　　Washington Financial Agreement Violates Interests of British People
Bevin and Cripps trusted America's vague promise that they would "consider what can be done" to increase its imports from Britain, and agreed to "remove all obstacles to American investment," "reduce" the "production costs" - that is, wages - of goods sold in the dollar market, and "keep the belt tight" on the stomachs of British workers. The goal of the discussion was said to be to find ways to overcome Britain's dollar deficit, but the agreement just reached in Washington intensifies the dollar problem. All the profits earned by American companies by exploiting British workers will be converted into dollars and sent back to the United States.

The widely circulated "Daily Mail" reflects the attitude of a large part of the British bourgeoisie in its editorial, who are indignant at handing over the exploitation of colonies and their people to American monopoly capitalists, and angrily condemn this "final despicable auction" by the "socialist" government (referring to the Labour government). The newspaper expressed the British capitalists' love for their imperial resources, saying that the "socialists" "are auctioning off their enormously valuable undeveloped assets to the United States." The newspaper said: In the future, "according to the investment agreement reached in Washington, all possible minerals, plants, and animals within the Empire will be developed by the United States, not by Britain. All these markets could have been developed in pounds sterling. But now it will be in dollars. Every place where a dollar is invested will be a small piece of the dollar area. What was previously the sterling area will become the dollar area." The Daily Mail continued: "Not only that, but we will also pay the price for this agreement in other ways. For example, Americans will not only control their own copper in the future, but also the copper of the British Empire. Once they can do this, they will establish a cartel or trust, which will no longer be a national matter, but a global one. As for oil, all the potential resources of all British colonies, all unexplored areas, all places where the oil industry may have development prospects, will be transferred to the control of the United States." The newspaper pointed out that Britain is "once again bound" - "once bound in our market by Clause 9 of the US loan agreement, which prevents us from trading with our own people if that trade is deemed to discriminate against the United States," and the second time, by the auction of "our colonial assets."

The British Communist Party's "Workers' Daily" pointed out that the American economic chains are an attack on the British working class and hundreds of millions of enslaved colonial people. The Workers' Daily wrote that the Washington agreement "means the strengthening of capitalist control, a complete betrayal of the hopes of the advanced elements of the labor movement." It means "selling parts or all of the factories, workshops, and industries of the British Isles to American investors. In addition to our own employers and exploiters, we will now have American bosses with privileges here." It will bring "fiercely anti-union American employers into our country... It will strengthen the Confederation of British Industry and British employers in every effort to attack British wages and working conditions." The Workers' Daily wrote: "The United States is doing everything possible to worsen Britain's economic crisis. It has increased the pressure on Britain to reduce its further resistance to dependence, to break the sterling area and British monopoly trade controls, to seize the entire empire, devalue the pound, and attack the living conditions of the British working class. Now, as part of this process, Britain and the British Empire are being sold piece by piece to American lenders." The newspaper emphasized, "This is not a great plan for new economic development that will increase world wealth; on the contrary, it is being formulated against the backdrop of a developing capitalist economic downturn. For the colonial people, it only means changing from one exploiter to another. The American bosses will replace the British bosses, and the Labour government will provide troops to suppress the colonial revolutions against the two masters." The Workers' Daily concluded: "It is not a solution to Britain's economic crisis. On the contrary, it will further tighten the chains of American enslavement."

　　资本主义国家无法逃脱经济危机
  　英工党政府拍卖民族利益     
    英舆论谴责美英加金融会谈
    【新华社北平十六日电】电通社伦敦十三日讯：贝文及克利浦斯与华盛顿之间所达成的协定，把英国及大英帝国的门户打开，让美国资本侵入。这被广大阶层的英国人民认为是向金元皇帝的可耻的大拍卖。协定的最后结局很可能是，由于美国公司在英国领土内设厂并发生竞争，而把英国的民族工业摧毁。
    　　　　华盛顿金融协定违背英人民利益
    美国含糊地允诺他们会“考虑可以怎样做”以增加它自英国的输入，贝文及克利浦斯即听信了它的诺言，而同意“撤销一切对美国投资的障碍”，“削减”运销美元市场的货物的“生产成本”——那就是工资——并对英国工人的肚子“维持紧束腰带”。讨论的目标，据说是要寻得克服英国美元逆差的办法，但刚刚在华盛顿达成的协定，却使美元问题紧张化。美国公司因剥削英国工人而赚得的全部利润，将可转变成美元而送回美国。
    销路广大的“每日邮报”在社论内反映很大部分英国资产阶级的态度，他们对于把对殖民地及其人民的剥削转交给美国垄断资本家都感到愤慨，并愤怒地谴责“社会主义”政府（指工党政府）的这种“最后的卑鄙的拍卖”。该报表现了英国资本家对其帝国资源的爱惜，说“社会主义者”“把自己价值巨大的未开发的资产拍卖给美国”。该报说：在将来，“根据在华盛顿达成的投资协定，帝国之内一切可能的矿物、植物和动物，都将由美国开发，而不是由英国开发了。全部这些市场本来都可以用英镑开发的。但是，现在将是用美元了。每一个美元投资的地方，都将为美元区的一小片。以前是英镑区的，将来都要变成美元区了”。每日邮报继称：“不仅如此，我们还要在别的方面对这一协定付出代价。例如，美国人将来不仅控制他们自己的铜，而且也要控制英帝国的铜。如果他们一旦能做到这步，他们将建立起一种卡迭尔或是托辣斯制度，这将不再是一件全国范围的事，而是一件世界范围的事了。至于石油方面，所有一切英国殖民地潜在的资源，一切不曾探测过的区域，一切石油工业可能有发展希望的地方，均将转入美国的掌握”。该报指出，英国“再度被束缚”——“一度在我们的市场内被美国贷款协定第九款所束缚，该款阻止我们与我们自己的人民贸易，假如那种贸易被认为是歧视美国的话”，而第二次，则是对“我们殖民地资产”的拍卖。
    英国共产党的工人日报则指出美国的经济锁链是对英国工人阶级及千百万被奴役的殖民地人民的进攻。工人日报写道华盛顿协定“意味着资本主义掌握的加强，对劳工运动先进者希望的完全背叛”。它意味着“部分或全部地把英伦三岛的工厂、工场及各种工业卖给美国投资者。除了我们本国的雇主和剥削者以外，现在我们又要有美国东家在这里的特权”。它将把“激烈反对职工会的美国雇主引入我国…………它将加强英国工业界联合会及英国雇主，尽一切努力向英国的工资及劳动条件进攻”，工人日报写道：“美国以一切的办法使英国的经济危机更为恶化，它已增加了压力，使英国减少它更进一步对倚赖性的反抗，击碎英镑区域及英国独占的贸易控制，夺获整个帝国，把英镑贬值，并进攻英国工人阶级的生活状况。现在，作为这个过程的一部分，英国及英帝国正被一片片地卖予美国贷款人”。该报强调，“这并不是将增加世界财富的新经济发展的伟大计划，相反地，它是在发展着的资本主义经济下跌的背景上订出来的。对殖民地人民来说，则仅意味着自一个剥削者换为另一个而已，美国东家将取英国东家的地位而代之，而工党政府则将供给军队以镇压殖民地对两个主人的革命”。工人日报在结语中说：“它并不是解决英国经济危机的办法。相反地，它将更收紧美国奴役的锁链”。
