A Record of Visits with Representatives to the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference
	Shanghai Jiangnan Shipyard's Factory Protection Struggle
		An Interview with Specially Invited Representative and Copper Craftsman Li Shiliang
			Liang Shan

	Li Shiliang, a specially invited representative to the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, is a technician (copper craftsman) at the Jiangnan Shipyard in Shanghai. He is fifty-six years old this year and started working at the age of eighteen. Counting only from when he entered the shipyard directly under the Nationalist Party's Ministry of Navy, he has been there for twenty-six years by the time of liberation this year. He is a worker with a strong sense of justice and has made many efforts for the vital interests of his fellow workers over the past twenty years.

	On the morning of the third day of the conference, when the reporter went to visit him, he introduced the vivid scenes of the shipyard workers' heroic factory protection before the liberation of Shanghai and their strenuous efforts to rush repairs after liberation!

	A few days before the liberation of Shanghai, the war criminal Gui Yongqing, the pseudo-Minister of the Navy, stole all the wages originally intended to be paid to the workers. He also conspired to dismiss the employees, forcing technical talents to go to Taiwan, seizing repaired ships and important machinery and materials, and even attempting to destroy the entire factory. Gui's criminal conspiracy aroused the righteous indignation of more than 3,000 employees throughout the factory. They organized a factory protection team to fight against these bandits with the "three-anti" struggle of anti-relocation, anti-dismissal, and anti-destruction.

	The factory protection team first adopted a "non-cooperation" approach, delaying work, and prioritizing less important tasks to disrupt Gui's relocation plan. For example, a 3,350-ton landing craft took two full weeks to load, while it usually only took three or four days. When loading, they piled things up haphazardly, so a ship that could carry 3,000 tons could not hold more than 2,000 tons. When the first ship loaded for Taiwan was about to set sail, only three of the ten cranes were working. When the second ship was about to be loaded, all the crane operators in the factory had disappeared, leaving Gui and his bandit chiefs helplessly anxious. On another occasion, Gui ordered eight cannons to be moved onto the ship, but the workers deliberately loaded them unevenly. When the Huangpu River receded, the ship and the cannons capsized into the river.

	When Gui saw that the workers were "not cooperating" with them, he transferred a division of naval infantry to monitor and suppress them, and ordered their guard battalion and marine corps to carry the cargo. But they were all laymen, and they had to consult the workers to dismantle the machines. The workers specifically dismantled unimportant parts and dealt with them slowly. They cleverly took valuable motors, meters, instruments, and other materials and files home when the enemy was not paying attention. The heavy ones were scattered and hidden in remote parts of the factory or buried underground. The engineers also hid important charts. Once, when Jiang and Gui's bandit troops escorted workers and forced them to repair ships, they searched around and found no engineers, so they could not work in the end. The whole factory was united in this way, causing Gui's attempt to repair nearly ten ships and loot a large amount of materials to Taiwan to fail miserably.

	In response to Gui's dismissal order, the entire factory bravely joined the struggle against dismissal. Gui planned to force more than 1,000 technical talents and skilled workers in the factory to go to Taiwan to continue to be driven by the reactionaries, but the slogan "Don't go with Chiang Kai-shek's bandits" resounded among the employees. Many engineers hid under the cover of the workers. Only two hundred people were forced to go to Taiwan. Gui ordered that employees were not allowed to enter the factory from May 20th, but the employees who insisted on the struggle were unwilling to disperse. Most of them stayed near the factory, eagerly waiting for the arrival of the People's Liberation Army and preparing to serve the people's new China.

	Under the circumstances that Gui's conspiracy did not succeed, he viciously announced the law of "execution for those who strike," and arrested the worker leaders Wang Huikang and Zhu Genji, but this did not scare the heroic and unyielding workers. The struggle continued. Under the protest of all employees and various rescues, Wang and Zhu finally regained their freedom.

	In the anti-sabotage struggle, the workers also wrote a glorious page.

	The bandit army wanted to concentrate the welding vehicles to destroy them, which would be done with just a few grenades, but the workers refused to concentrate them, so only a few vehicles were damaged. The bandit army's methods were vicious. When they buried explosives, they forced the workers to bury twelve barrels of gasoline, vainly attempting to destroy everything with fire. But the workers secretly replaced them with nine barrels of water. The important departments of their shipyard were not greatly damaged.

	The employees' selfless struggle to protect the factory not only preserved many construction talents and worker leaders from the poisonous hands of Chiang and Gui war criminals, rescued a large number of valuable machines and materials, increased the wealth of the people's country, but also laid a solid foundation for the rush repair project and the restoration of production after liberation, and supported the People's Liberation Army.

	All employees expressed their deep hatred for the serious damage caused by the Kuomintang bandits, but they were full of firm confidence in the restoration of production after liberation. They said: "The Communist Party is here, and the factory is our own. No matter how badly the enemy destroys it, we will be able to restore production quickly!"

	After liberation, the workers immediately returned to the factory one after another, organized a rush repair team and a people's security team, and carried out repair work while assisting the People's Liberation Army in guarding the factory and warehouse.

	On May 25th, in the morning just after liberation, the workers renovated two transport ships capable of carrying hundreds of people within three hours and sent thousands of People's Liberation Army soldiers across the Huangpu River to participate in the battle to completely wipe out the enemy. The machinery of the power plant was damaged by the explosion of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits. Under the rush repairs of seventeen workers, the chimney of the boiler room was already smoking on the morning of the fifth day. During the rush repairs, the foremen and team leaders who had never done anything in the past also participated in the work. When repairing the dock, the engineers estimated that it would take three months to complete, but under the leadership of the military control commission and after joint consultation by the workers, they organized a shock force and completed the task in one and a half months. This surprised the director and engineers!

	Just as Chairman Mao said in his opening speech at this People's Political Consultative Conference: "The imperialists and domestic and foreign reactionaries will never be reconciled to their failure, and they will still make a final struggle." At noon on August 3rd, nine enemy planes with four engine propellers took turns bombing the shipyard. This aroused the unparalleled anger of all the employees throughout the factory. The reactionaries' bombs could not suppress the workers' enthusiasm for loving the people's motherland. They knew that they could only live and work in peace after the People's Liberation Army had attacked Taiwan and liberated the whole of China. "When the bandit planes come, we hide; when the bandit planes leave, we work" became their creed.

	When the reporter asked Li Shiliang himself about his role in the factory protection struggle, he said modestly and briefly: "The factory protection work is the collective strength of everyone, and personal achievements are insignificant."

	He felt extremely honored and excited to be able to participate in the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference this time. He said: "I never thought that an ordinary worker like me could participate in this meeting. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the workers have truly turned over!" The two days of the meeting gave him a deep and satisfactory impression. He realized the full democracy of the meeting itself and the unity of representatives from all democratic classes across the country under the banner of Chairman Mao. He said in a Shanghai-accented Zhejiang dialect: "Our working class must support the construction of a new China under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao!"

	Finally, he ended our conversation with the following words.

	"The workers of Shanghai have always been united. Since the First Great Revolution, they have had a glorious tradition of nearly thirty years of struggle. The work of national construction will certainly not lag behind other places, and this can be proved by future facts."

　　中国人民政协代表访问记
  　上海江南造船所护厂斗争           
    记特邀代表铜工匠李时良的谈话
    梁山 人民政治协商会议特邀代表李时良，是上海江南造船所的技术工人（铜工匠），今年五十六岁了，十八岁开始做工，仅从进入国民党海军部直辖的造船所算起，到今年解放时就已经有二十六个年头。他是一个富有正义感的工人，二十年来，为了工友们的切身利益，曾作了不少的努力。
    大会进行的第三天上午，记者去访问他时，他介绍了上海解放前造船所工友英勇护厂和解放后奋力抢修的生动斗争场面！
    上海解放前几天，伪海军部长战犯桂永清偷走了原来预备发给工友们的全部工资，更阴谋遣散职工，强迫技术人才到台湾去；劫走修造好的舰艇和重要机器资材；甚至要想破坏整个工厂。桂匪这一罪恶阴谋，引起了全厂三千余名职工的义愤，他们组织了护厂队，用反搬迁队、反遣散、反破坏的“三反”斗争来与这些匪徒们对抗。
    护厂队首先先采用了“不合作”的方式，以拖延怠工，避重就轻等来破坏桂匪的搬迁计划，如：一艘三千三百五十吨的登陆艇，装了足足两个星期，平时的速度，只要三四天就行了；装货时乱七八糟的堆上就算，一条能装三千吨的船，最多不超过两千吨，就已无法再装了；装载去台湾的第一艘舰开船时，十架吊车（起重机）才开动了三架，装第二艘时，厂里的吊车司机都溜光了，使桂匪匪首们只好白瞪着两个眼干着急。另一次桂匪叫把八门大炮搬上船去，工友们故意把重量装得不平衡，黄浦江退潮时，连船带炮都翻进了江心。
    桂匪看出工人与他们“不合作”，就调了一个师的海军陆战队去监视和镇压，并叫他们的警卫营、陆战队等来搬运。但他们都是外行，拆卸机器还得请教工人，工友们就专门拆卸些不重要的零件，慢慢地应付他们，把贵重的马达、电表、仪器和其它器材档案，乘敌人不注意时，轻巧的拿回家去，笨重的分散隐蔽在工厂偏僻处或者埋到地下，工程师们也将重要的图表藏起，有一次蒋桂匪军押着工人，强迫他们修船时，找来找去没有了工程师，结果还是不能工作。全厂这样的始终团结一致，使桂匪准备修复近十条舰艇，劫走大批物资去台湾的企图遭到可耻的失败。
    针对着桂匪的遣散令，全厂英勇的卷入了反遣散的斗争中，桂匪计划强迫厂中一千多名技术人才和熟练工人到台湾去继续供反动派驱使，但“不跟蒋匪走”的口号却响亮地在职工中传布着，许多工程师在工人的掩护下，躲藏起来了，被迫去台的一共只有二百人。桂匪下令从五月二十日起不准职工进厂，但坚持斗争的职工们谁也不愿分散，他们大都居留在工厂附近，热切地等待解放军到来，准备为人民的新中国服务。
    在桂匪阴谋不逞的情况下，他又穷凶极恶地宣布了“怠工者枪毙”的律条，并逮捕了工人领袖王惠康和朱根基，可是这也没有吓倒英勇不屈的工人们，斗争依旧进行着，在全体职工抗议和多方营救下，王、朱两人终于恢复了自由。
    在反破坏斗争中，工友们也写下了辉煌的一页。
    匪军要把电焊车集中起来破坏，只要几个手榴弹就完了，但工人们硬是不给集中，所以只被损坏了少数几辆。匪军的手段是狠毒的，他们在埋炸药时强迫工人埋上十二桶汽油，妄图用火来毁灭一切。但工人们偷天换日地换上了九桶清水。他们造船厂的重要部门也都没有受到多大损伤。
    职工们奋不顾身的护厂斗争，不但在蒋、桂战犯的毒手下，保存了很多建设人才和工人领袖，抢救了大批贵重的机器物资，增加了人民国家的财富，更为解放后的抢修工程和恢复生产打下了坚实基础，支援了解放军。
    全体职工对国民党匪帮的严重破坏，无不表示切齿痛恨，但他们对解放后的恢复生产，却充满了坚强信心。他们表示：“共产党来了，工厂是我们自己的了，不管敌人的破坏怎样厉害，我们一定能很快的恢复生产！”
    解放后，工友们当即陆续回厂，组织了抢修队和人民保安队，一面进行修复工作，一面协助解放军看管工厂和仓库。
    五月二十五日，刚才获得解放的清晨，工友们在三小时内就装修起两只能装数百人的运输船，把成千解放军送过黄浦江，参加全部歼灭敌人的战斗。发电厂的机器被蒋匪爆炸时震坏了，在十七个工友抢修下，第五天上午，锅炉房的烟囱就已冒着烟。抢修中，过去一贯不动手的匠首和领班也参加了工作。抢修船坞时，工程师计算三个月才能完工，但在军管会领导下，经工人共同商议，组织突击，结果一个半月完成了任务。这使所长和工程师们都惊叹不止！
    正象毛主席在这次人民政协开幕词中所说的一样：“帝国主义者和国内外反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎”。八月三日中午，九架四个发动引擎的敌机，轮番轰炸造船所。这更激起了全厂职工的无比愤怒。反动派的炸弹压不住工人们爱护人民祖国的热情，他们知道：只有解放军打到台湾去，解放全中国之后才能安居乐业。“匪机来，我们避；匪机走，我们干”成了他们的信条。
    记者问到李时良本人在护厂斗争中的作用时，他谦虚而简短地说：“护厂工作是大家集体的力量，个人的成就是微不足道的。”
    他对于这次能参加中国人民政协，感到无上光荣和兴奋。他说：“象我这样一个普通工人能参加这个会，真是想不到的。在共产党领导下，工人真是翻身了！”两天会议给他的印象是深刻而满意的，他体会到了会议本身的充分民主与全国各民主阶层代表，在毛主席旗帜下的团结一致。他用带些上海腔的浙东方言说：“我们工人阶级一定拥护在共产党毛主席领导下建设新中国！”
    最后，他用下面几句话结束了我们的谈话。
    “上海工人向来是团结的，第一次大革命以来，有将近三十年斗争的光荣传统，建国工作一定不会比别地方落后，这是将来事实可以证明的。”
