[Baoding Telegram] In southern Hebei, the famous cotton-producing areas of Handan, Hengshui, etc., are seeing new cotton entering the market in succession. State-owned trading departments and supply and marketing cooperatives are vigorously purchasing it. The Handan region has planted a total of more than 1.7 million mu of cotton. Although devastated by drought, pests, and other disasters, it can still maintain 60% to 70% of its harvest. In newly planted cotton areas such as Wei County, Quzhou, and She County, although there are difficulties such as low technology and lack of fertilizer, the average yield per mu can still reach more than 66 jin of seed cotton. The Hengshui region also has a 60% to 70% harvest. Farmers are extremely excited, and every household is busy picking cotton. Individual merchants are taking the opportunity to purchase at low prices, resulting in each jin of raw cotton being worth only six jin of millet. In order to protect the profits of cotton farmers and implement the government's cotton price policy of eight to ten jin of millet per jin of raw cotton, the regional trade company has established purchasing stations and transported 400,000 jin of millet and 10 million yuan to each station for purchasing cotton. Supply and marketing cooperatives have established cotton purchasing stations in all counties, sending a large number of cadres to work at each station, and notifying farmers in each village to go to the station to exchange cotton for millet. Supply and marketing cooperatives in all counties of the Handan region have begun purchasing cotton. Cheng'an has already purchased more than 10,000 jin. The region also plans to raise the standard price of raw cotton to nine jin of millet, ensuring that cotton farmers obtain substantial profits.

　　邯郸衡水等产棉区
  　新花源源上市
    贸易部门大力组织收购提高棉价保障棉农利润
    【保定电】河北南部邯郸、衡水等著名的产棉区，新花陆续涌入市场，国营贸易部门、供销社正大力收购。邯郸专区共植棉一百七十余万亩，虽经旱、虫等灾害摧残，尚能保持六、七成的收成。魏县、曲周、涉县等新植棉区，虽有技术低、肥料缺等困难，但每亩平均亦可产六十六斤以上的籽棉。衡水专区亦有六、七成收成。农民情绪异常兴奋，家家户户均紧张采摘。有个别商贩乘机以廉价收购，致使每斤净棉只合米六斤。区贸易公司为保护棉农利润，贯彻执行政府每斤净棉八至十斤小米的棉价政策，特设立收购站，并将四十万斤米、一千万元运至各站作收购棉花之用。供销社已在各县普设收购棉站，派大批干部至各站工作，通知各村农民到该站以棉换米。邯郸专区各县供销社已开始收购，成安已收买万余斤，该区并有计划的将标准净棉提到九斤小米，保证棉农获丰厚利润。
