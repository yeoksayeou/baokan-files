Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 31st: The Polish News Agency, Warsaw, 25th, reports: The Polish Trade Union Central Council recently passed a resolution at its plenary session outlining the tasks of the trade unions in the struggle for peace and trade union unity, defending trade union rights and freedoms; tasks concerning production, labor discipline, and protecting social property; and the current activities of the Trade Union Central Council and the movement to communicate the resolutions of the recent Polish Trade Union Congress.

The resolution begins by stating: The plenary session of the Trade Union Central Council fully endorses the decisions of the Second World Trade Union Congress held in Milan. The Central Council instructs the Presidium and all trade unions to cooperate most actively with the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress and to mobilize the entire working class and laboring intellectuals to fight for peace. Standing committees for the defense of peace must be established in every factory and agency to prepare for participation in the October 2nd International Day of Struggle for Peace, and every action to strive for peace must be linked with promoting the Polish people's friendship with the Soviet Union.

The second part of the resolution states that the trade union's struggle for democratic peace and a higher standard of living is inseparable from the struggle for national economic development. Production issues must occupy a central position in the work of trade unions. Trade unions must develop the daily work of striving to achieve economic plans ahead of schedule, so that the three-year plan can be completed two or three months before the end of the year. All trade union committees and branches must focus on production issues and actively participate in the struggle to improve quality and reduce production costs. These tasks are closely linked to the trade union's fundamental tasks of caring for workers' work safety, hygiene, social conditions, and housing. Trade unions should boldly promote labor emulation and increase vigilance against reactionary agents carrying out economic sabotage and espionage in enterprises and transportation.

The third part of the resolution points out the achievements in workers' welfare, such as the State Council's allocation of 2 billion zlotys for the repair of workers' housing and the establishment of a special committee to handle housing management funds and investment funds. The Trade Union Central Council has formulated a draft law on labor social inspection and has created the highest national medals for service to People's Poland—the Order of the Builders of People's Poland and the Banner of Labor.

　　波兰职工会中央理事会
  　号召团结为和平斗争
  　把每一行动和促进对苏友谊联系起来
    【新华社北平三十一日电】波兰通讯社华沙二十五日讯：波兰职工会中央理事会最近在全体会议上通过决定，规定职工会在争取和平和职工会团结、保卫职工会权利与自由的斗争中的任务；关于生产、劳动纪律、保护社会财产的任务；以及职工会中央理事会目前的活动与传达最近波兰职工会代表大会决议的运动。
    决议开头说：职工会中央理事会全体会议完全赞同在米兰举行的世界职工会第二届代表大会的决定，中央理事会责成主席团和一切职工会，与世界拥护和平大会常设委员会作最积极的合作，并动员全体工人阶级和劳动知识分子为和平而斗争。必须在每一个工厂和机关成立保卫和平常设委员会，准备参加十月二日国际和平斗争日的筹备工作，并把争取和平的每一个行动和促进波兰人民对苏联的友谊联系起来。
    决议的第二部分称，职工会争取民主的和平、争取较高生活水平的斗争，是与争取国家经济发展的斗争不可分的。生产问题在职工会工作中必须占中心的地位。职工会必须发展争取提早实现经济计划的日常工作，俾使在年终前两三个月就可完成三年计划。各工会委员会及分会必须集中注意于生产问题，并积极参加提高质量和减低生产成本的斗争。这些任务是和职工会关心工人的工作安全、卫生、社会条件与住房等方面的基本任务密切联系着的。职工会应大胆地推广劳动竞赛，并提高对付反动派代理人在企业和交通事业中进行经济破坏和间谍活动的警惕性。
    决议的第三部分指出了举办工人福利的成就，例如国务会议已指拨了二十亿兹罗提作为修缮工人住宅之用，并已成立了特别委员会，来处理房屋管理处的基金和投资基金。职工会中央理事会制订了劳动社会检查法草案，并已创设了为人民波兰服务的最高国家勋章——人民波兰建设者勋章和劳动旗勋章。
