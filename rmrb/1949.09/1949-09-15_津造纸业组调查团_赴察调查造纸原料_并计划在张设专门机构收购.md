　　【Zhangjiakou News】In order to solve the problem of paper-making raw materials, the Tianjin State-owned Pulp Company and 20 private paper mills such as Changjiang and Xincheng have formed an investigation group to investigate the production of various paper-making raw materials in the Chahar and Suiyuan areas, and plan to purchase and transport them to Tianjin in large quantities. In order to assist the group in understanding the situation and facilitate the completion of the investigation task, the Industry and Commerce Department of the Provincial Government held a symposium on the province's paper-making raw materials on the morning of the 4th of this month. Departments or individuals familiar with the situation in various regions gave detailed introductions to the production of various paper-making raw materials in various regions.

　　After testing, *Zhi Ji* grass is an excellent paper-making raw material, and it is mostly produced in the grasslands of northern Chahar. Places such as Huade, Kangbao, Baoyuan, and Duolun have large quantities of production. Local people use it to make bamboo baskets, brooms, and grass fences, or as raw materials for building houses. It is also a sideline for farmers in northern Chahar, but most of the *Zhi Ji* grass is not utilized and is burned as firewood by the folks.

　　Sesame stalks, one of the special products of Chahar Province, can also be used as paper-making raw materials. It is said that sesame stalks can be used to make banknote paper. It is estimated that the annual output of the province is about 100 million *jin*. In addition to the 50 million *jin* that can be used by the Xuanhua Paper Mill, there are still more than 50 million *jin* that can be exported.

　　In addition, sulfur is also an indispensable raw material for the paper-making industry. China produces very little sulfur, and in the past it mostly relied on imports from abroad. Hunyuan, Guangling, Xuanhua, Yanggao and other places in Chahar Province produce sulfur, but due to backward technology, mining is not widespread. At present, the monthly output is only 10,000 *jin*. In the future, it is urgent to improve technology and carry out large-scale mining.

　　The investigation group decided to go to northern Chahar in the short term to investigate the output of *Zhi Ji* grass, and plans to set up a purchasing agency in Zhangjiakou to transport it to Tianjin in large quantities. At the same time, the group will also start investigating detailed materials on sesame stalks and sulfur in preparation for future purchases, so as to fully supply the needs of the Tianjin paper industry.

　　津造纸业组调查团 　 赴察调查造纸原料
  　并计划在张设专门机构收购
    【张市讯】天津国营纸浆公司及私营长江、新成等二十家纸厂，为解决造纸原料问题，特组成调查团，前来察绥一带，调查各种造纸原料的出产情况，并计划大批收购运津。省府工商处为协助该团了解情况，便于完成调查任务起见，本月四日上午举行了关于本省出产造纸原料的座谈会，由熟悉各个地区情况的部门或个人，详细介绍了各个地区各种造纸原料的出产情况。
    枳机草经化验为优良的造纸原料，以察北草地出产较多。如化德、康保、宝源、多伦等地都有大量出产，当地群众用以制作竹篮、扫帚、打草围或作盖房用原料，也是察北农民的一种副业，但大部分枳机草没被利用，被老乡们当柴烧。
    察省特产之一的胡麻秸，也可做为造纸原料，据说胡麻秸可制钞票纸，估计全省年产一亿斤左右，除宣化造纸厂可用五千万斤外，尚余五千余万斤可以输出。
    此外还有硫磺，亦为造纸工业不可缺少的原料。我国产硫磺很少，过去多靠国外输入。察省浑源、广灵、宣化、阳高等地，都有硫磺出产，但因技术落后，开采不普遍，目前每月产量只有一万斤，今后亟需改进技术，大量开采。
    调查团一行，决定短期内先赴察北调查枳机草的产量情况，并计划在张市设立收购机构，大量输给天津。与此同时，该团并将着手调查胡麻秸和硫磺的详细材料，以备将来收购，充分供应天津造纸业的需要。
