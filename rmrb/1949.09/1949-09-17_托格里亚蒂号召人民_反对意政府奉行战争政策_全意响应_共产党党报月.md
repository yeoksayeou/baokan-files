Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 16th: TASS reports that the General Secretary of the Italian Communist Party, Togliatti, gave a speech on September 11th at a mass rally of 50,000 people in Terni, central Italy, celebrating L'Unità (this rally was one of numerous mass rallies held throughout Italy in response to the Italian Communist Party's "Communist Party Newspaper Month"). He discussed the political and economic situation in Italy and called on the people to unite to oppose the government's war policies and rescue Italy from the economic crisis caused by these policies.

Togliatti first reviewed the various events that had occurred since the general election of April 18, 1948, emphasizing that the offensive of slander, hatred, and provocation against the working people and their vanguard—the Communist Party—which was launched at that time and has continued to this day, "cannot force the people's forces to retreat, nor can it hinder the advance of the people's forces." "Today, more than a year after the reactionary offensive against the Communist Party by De Gasperi and Scelba began, the number of Communist Party members has increased by 100,000 to 200,000 compared to last year." Togliatti continued: The current domestic political and economic situation is fraught with great danger for the working people, the middle class, and the vast majority of Italians; looking to the future, they feel increasingly anxious and fearful, recognizing the need to change course. The threat of an economic crisis spreading from the United States to Europe is growing. The signs of this crisis in Italy are increasing unemployment, layoffs used as a means of intimidation by employers, shrinking production, and falling prices of agricultural products. All Italian citizens have felt the consequences of this crisis in their daily lives: insufficient water and electricity supply, and although wholesale bread prices are constantly falling, retail prices remain very high.

Togliatti then condemned the foreign policy of Italy's current rulers. These rulers declare that their policies are completely and substantially consistent with those of the United States, that is, with the policy of preparing for another world war against the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, and they intend to drag Italy into this war as well.

		Everyone should recognize:
		Italy will be reborn　The enemy's doomsday is doomed

Togliatti emphasized that all Italian people, with the exception of a small number, oppose this policy. Here, Togliatti recalled the suggestions he made a week earlier in his speech in Castellammare di Stabia, Naples. The purpose of these suggestions is to rescue Italy from the dangers it faces. These suggestions can be summarized as abandoning the policy of dividing Europe and the entire world, abandoning the policy that indicates war preparation. These suggestions can be summarized as following the policy of international cooperation among all free countries... However, the representatives of the opposing camp can only respond with their usual words, saying that these are merely "Communist Party suggestions" and therefore must be rejected. Togliatti stated: These gentlemen pretend that they do not know: The Communist Party, together with the Socialist Party, is in fact the only force. For more than twenty years, it has proven without exception on all occasions: it, and only it, represents the interests of the working people, and not only the interests of the working people within its ranks, but also the lofty interests of all citizens and the entire Italian nation. This is the truth that history has proven. We, and only we, have taken the correct stance and pointed out the correct direction, while our enemies today are praising fascism and advising young people to engage in criminal wars under the banner of fascism.

Togliatti said: Let our enemies have no illusions. Their doomsday is doomed, just as the doomsday of the system based on the exploitation of the working people throughout the world, and the rule based on the dictatorship and autocracy of a small number of privileged groups, has been doomed, so is the doomsday of such an Italy, the doomsday of such an Italy where the economy and all the wealth are concentrated in the hands of this group, the doomsday of such an Italy where the peasants cannot get land, the doomsday of such an Italy that does not take the road of revival.

Italy must and will be reborn, just as the people in this half of the world, from our borders to the distant shores of the Pacific, are now successfully walking on a new road and consolidating their position, and no threat can make them retreat. Togliatti emphasized: Our task is to make all citizens understand these facts. The people must be awakened so that they can see the danger that is threatening our country because our government is unwilling to take the necessary measures that are in the interests of everyone to alleviate the consequences of the economic crisis that has already gripped Italy.

This danger is the result of government policy. With the support of American imperialism, the government is pursuing a policy of dragging Italy and Europe into a new war. Everyone must be made aware, everyone must know, that at present, as long as all those who are aware of this danger can unite closely regardless of party affiliation, religious belief, and political inclination, it is possible to change the path our country is taking. We suggest implementing a policy that can alleviate the consequences of the crisis and avoid the danger of war. We are prepared to move forward shoulder to shoulder with everyone who desires this policy, and we are certain that the vast majority of the Italian people desire this policy.

### 托格里亚蒂号召人民　反对意政府奉行战争政策  全意响应“共产党党报月”

　　托格里亚蒂号召人民
  　反对意政府奉行战争政策
    全意响应“共产党党报月”
    【新华社北平十六日电】据塔斯社讯，意大利共产党总书记托格里亚蒂，九月十一日在意中部特尔尼庆祝团结报的五万人群众大会（这个大会是全意各地为响应意共发起的“共产党党报月”而举行的无数群众大会之一）上发表演说，纵论意大利政治经济形势，号召全国人民团结起来，反对政府奉行的战争政策，把意大利由这一政策所造成的经济危机中拯救出来。
    托格里亚蒂首先回溯自一九四八年四月十八日大选举以后所发生的各种事件，强调指出：在那个时候所发动并继续至今的对劳动人民及其先锋队——共产党的污蔑、仇恨和挑衅的攻势，“并不能迫使人民的力量后退，也不能阻拦人民力量的前进”。“今天，在谢尔巴和加斯贝利对共产党的反动攻势开始年余以后，共产党党员已较去年增加了一二十万人”。托格里亚蒂继称：目前国内的政治经济情况，充满着对于劳动人民、中等阶级和极大多数的意大利人的重大危险；他们展望未来，日益感到焦虑和恐惧，认识到有改变道路的必要。从美国向欧洲蔓延的经济危机的威胁在增长中。这一危机在意大利的征兆，是日益增加的失业，雇主们作为威胁手段的解雇、生产的萎缩和农产品价格的跌落。全体意大利公民群众已经在其日常生活中感受到这一危机的后果：水电供应不足，面包批发价格虽然不断跌落，但零售价格却仍然非常高昂。
    托格里亚蒂继之谴责当今意大利统治者的外交政策。这些统治者宣称他们与美国的政策完全而且实实在在地一致，即是说，与准备对苏联和人民民主国家的另一次世界大战的政策一致，他们打算把意大利也拖进这次大战。
    　　　　每一个人都应该认识：
    　　意大利必将新生　敌人的末日已经注定
    托格里亚蒂强调说：全体意大利人民，除了人数寥寥的一小群之外，都反对这一政策。在此，托格里亚蒂回溯了他一周以前在那不勒斯的卡斯提拉马里——狄斯塔比亚的演说中提出的建议。这些建议的目的，是把意大利救出它所碰到的危险。这些建议归结起来说，就是放弃分裂欧洲和整个世界的政策，放弃表示战争准备的政策。这些建议，归结起来说，就是遵行一切自由国家国际合作的政策………但是，反对阵营的代表，不能有任何其他回答，仅能用他们的惯用的话说，这些只是“共产党的建议”，因此必须予以否决。托格里亚蒂称：这些绅士们装做他们不知道：共产党与社会党一起，事实上是唯一的力量。二十余年来在一切场合下毫无例外地证明：它，而且只有它代表劳动人民的利益，而且不止是代表其队伍以内的劳动人民的利益，同时也代表全体公民、整个意大利民族的崇高利益。历史所证明了的真理就是这样。我们，而且只有我们采取了正确的立场，指出了正确的方向，而我们今天的敌手却在赞扬法西斯主义，劝青年们从事法西斯旗帜下的犯罪战争。
    托格里亚蒂称：让我们的敌人不要抱任何幻想吧。他们的末日是注定了，正如全世界以剥削劳动人民为基础的制度，以少数特权集团的独裁和专制为基础的统治，其末日已经注定了一样，那样一个意大利的末日也注定了，那样一个经济和全部财富都集中在这种集团手里的意大利，那样一个农民得不到土地的意大利，那样一个不走复兴道路的意大利的末日已经注定了。
    意大利定要而且将要新生，正如从我们的边境直到遥远的太平洋岸现在新生中一样，这半个世界上的人民正成功地走着新的道路，巩固着他们的地位，没有任何威胁能使他们退后。托格里亚蒂着重说：我们的任务，就是使一切公民都了解这些事实。必须唤起人民，使他们看到这样的危险，这一危险正由于我国政府不愿采取符合于一切人的利益的必需措施、以减轻业已攫住意大利的经济危机之后果而威胁着我国。
    这个危险，是政府政策造成的结果。政府在美帝国主义的支持之下，奉行着把意大利和欧洲拖向新战争的政策。必须让每一个人都认识到，必须让每一个人都知道，在目前，只要一切觉察这一危险的人能不分党派、宗教信仰和政治倾向而紧密地团结起来，是有可能改变我国所走的道路的。是我们建议实行能够减轻危机后果、避免战争危险的政策。我们准备与每一个愿望这种政策的人并肩前进，而且我们确知绝大多数意大利人民是愿望这种政策的。
