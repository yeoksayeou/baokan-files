　　The Struggle Between Old and New in Soviet Social Conditions (Part 2)
    By Fu Yueduofu
    The Party of Lenin and Stalin was the inspirer and organizer of the struggle between the old and the new. The Party waged a relentless struggle against the Trotskyites, who pushed the working class to split with the laboring peasants, attempting to clear the road for the restoration of the regime of landlords and capitalists. The Party waged a relentless struggle against the right-wing restorationists of capitalism, who reached "reconciliation" with the exploiters, defending the bourgeois theory that rich peasants could peacefully grow into socialism. The Party tirelessly consolidated the alliance of workers and peasants under the leadership of the working class, and on the basis of the policies of national industrialization, agricultural collectivization, and elimination of the exploiting classes, guided workers and peasants towards the victory of socialism and the establishment of a socialist society.
    As a result of implementing the Party's policies, the fundamental contradiction that existed in Soviet society during the revolutionary transition from capitalism to socialism was resolved. The contradiction between the two foundations of the Soviet regime—large-scale socialist industry and small-commodity agricultural economy—was resolved. The 25 million small peasant farms were merged into 240,000 large-scale socialist agricultural enterprises—collective farms based on the latest technology. The peasants with private ownership ideas have become a brand-new class—the collective farm peasants. This broke the opposition between the city and the countryside that had existed for thousands of years. Workers and peasants have become two free labor forces in a unified socialist society.
    The work of cultivating new Soviet intellectuals, mostly from worker and peasant backgrounds, and transforming the old intellectuals who finally came over to the Soviet regime, on the one hand, consolidated the friendly relationship between the working class and the peasants, and on the other hand, consolidated the friendly relationship between the working class and the Soviet intellectuals. Soviet intellectuals have united with their people. They serve the interests of the people honestly and have become equal members of a socialist society.
    The victory of socialism means the establishment of a completely new society. A completely new socio-economic foundation has been established for the first time in world history, all political and spiritual life has been completely rebuilt, and a completely new state system has also been established. The Soviet state is the first truly people's state in history. In Soviet society, democracy is the democracy of the people. The face of man and citizen has fundamentally changed: the interests of the people and the state have become the highest moral law of Soviet citizens' activities. People's views on labor have also undergone a fundamental transformation: in the Soviet Union, labor has changed from a heavy burden to a matter of glory, honor, heroism and heroism; labor is recognized by society as the highest and noblest mission of man.
    Soviet society is a new world that far surpasses the old capitalist world, a world of new and advanced culture.
    The guiding force for the development of Soviet society is the Bolshevik Party—the initiator and organizer of the struggle for the victory of the new over the old. The Bolshevik Party's world view is a world view that not only gives a scientific explanation of the past, but also faces the present and the future. In its activities, the Party leads itself with a profound knowledge of maturing historical needs, a clear understanding of the prospects for development, and the ability to foresee the course of events. The Bolshevik Party tirelessly cultivates the creative initiative of the working people. The progressive new initiatives put forward by innovators in Soviet society that are beneficial to society are strongly supported and receive comprehensive and practical support from the Bolshevik Party and the Soviet state, and the Soviet people have unlimited prospects for rapid development.
    Does this mean that the progress of Soviet society proceeds in a harmonious, smooth, and unhindered manner, without friction, without overcoming difficulties, and without the struggle of the new against the old? Naturally not.
    Comrade Stalin taught: “In our lives, there is always something dying. But what is dying is unwilling to die easily, but wants to fight for its own survival, to defend its own dead cause. In our lives, there is always something new born. But what is born is not easily born, but is whistling, crying, and defending its right to survival. The struggle between the old and the new, between the dying and the born, is the foundation of our development.”
    What exactly is the basis of the struggle between the old and the new? On what basis does this struggle arise? In what form does it take place?
    The Struggle Between Old and New in Soviet Social Conditions
    Socialist production constitutes the fundamental basis for the development of Soviet society and its transition to a higher stage. Comrade Stalin taught that the first characteristic of socialist production is that it never stays at one point for a long time, but is always in a state of change and development. Under the social conditions based on private ownership of the means of production, people who improve a certain means of production and a certain factor of productive forces do not think about what social consequences this improvement should bring, but only think about their own daily interests. Under socialism, the social consequences of production development are clearly recognized by the people and appear before the people for the clear goals they are pursuing. The Soviet people are striving to build a perfect communist society, and the development of national productive forces is moving towards this goal. In accordance with this goal, the Bolshevik Party and the Soviet state determine and formulate the economic tasks facing the Soviet people. As early as the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks), Comrade Stalin formulated the basic economic task for an entire historical period. Comrade Stalin said:
    “In terms of production technology and the speed of industrial development, we have surpassed the major capitalist countries. This is very good. But this is not enough. We must also surpass them economically. We can do this, and we must do this. Only when we surpass the major capitalist countries economically can we expect that our country will be completely filled with consumer goods, we will have abundant means of production, and we will be able to transition from the first stage of communism to the second stage” (see “Problems of Leninism”, 11th edition, pages 578 to 579).
    The basic economic tasks are specifically expressed in the national economic plans. These plans have a guiding influence on production development and its transition to a higher stage. New tasks are consciously put forward in front of production, and higher new requirements for developing technology, organizing the production process, and researching new methods for improving production and increasing labor productivity are revealed. In the struggle to victoriously solve these new tasks, the creative initiative of the working people is brought into play, and the working people make production move from the stage that has been reached to a higher stage. But with the emergence of new things, new and old contradictions also arise.
    In Soviet society, the struggle between the old and the new appears as a struggle against fatigue, inertia, and conservatism, and a struggle to overcome the passive, and sometimes active, resistance of backward elements.
    In Soviet society, the planned economic system has triumphed. But spontaneous factors still exist, and this factor is currently being fought against.
    The Struggle Between Old and New in Soviet Social Conditions
    Industry, agriculture, transportation—all sectors of the Soviet national economy are advancing rapidly. Innovators in production are inventing more sophisticated machines and mechanical devices, adopting more suitable working methods and new forms of production process organization. However, we still have people here who are permeated with the spirit of fatigue, conservatism, inertia, and conservatism. These people not only do not rush to innovation, to boldly study new things, to actively create, but often are hostile to everything new created by people with initiative and creativity, oppose new things, hinder the implementation of new things, and stick to old things, thus becoming an obstacle to further progress.
    In Soviet society, labor has become a matter of glory, heroism and heroism. But there are still people who evade labor. The opposition between the individual and society on the part of individual backward people has not been completely eliminated. Some collective farm members still have the desire to give most attention to their personal economy, harming the public economy.
    This situation also exists in all other aspects of social life—in terms of morality, living habits, and culture. Here, the new things that take the lead meet the inertia and fatigue of backward elements. Remnants of the old still exist in all aspects of social life. Our society is advancing even more in the struggle to completely overcome the remnants of the old.
    In Soviet society, a completely new state system has been created. This state system is based on the most active participation of the broadest masses of the people in political life. However, here, there are still people who are deeply dyed with the anti-socialist spirit of petty-bourgeois and bourgeois individualism. Remnants of the old are also manifested in bureaucracy. Bureaucracy has not been eradicated in individual links of state organs and even party organs among individual staff members. There are also such staff members who have become arrogant bureaucrats, treating "civilians" with arrogance and contempt, combining fatigue and conservatism, bureaucracy and formalism.
    Sticking to old things is also manifested in the scope of ideological activities. Among our intellectuals, some have not abandoned the slavish manifestations of worshiping bourgeois culture, and have become prisoners of old tendencies and old views that have long been dead in science, philosophy, ethics, and aesthetics.
    There are also people who are unfamiliar with the proposal of new issues in science, have become prisoners of dogmatism, and are afraid to push theory forward. Among philosophers, there are often people who take an uncritical attitude towards philosophy before the advent of Marxism, exaggerating the achievements of the representatives of this philosophy, and completely failing to understand the depth of the revolutionary leap that marked the emergence of Marxist philosophy in the history of philosophy. On the issues of literature and art, and on the issues of aesthetics, there are manifestations of opposition to and hostility towards Soviet literature and Soviet art that are indifferent to politics. In terms of ethics, the old consciousness can often be seen manifested in the non-communist behavior of people's family lives, and in the remnants of nationalism that cannot coexist with the Soviet ideology of national friendship...….
    The phenomenon that some Soviet intellectuals inherited from the old aristocratic intellectuals and bourgeois intellectuals, the inferior, praising foreign culture and underestimating the significance of the great Russian culture in world history, has not yet been eliminated. Individual people still do not understand the superiority of Soviet culture over modern bourgeois culture.
    The Struggle Between Old and New in Soviet Social Conditions
    For thousands of years, the various exploiting classes that occupied the ruling position, in order to conceal the selling and profit-making nature of their own ideologies, instilled in intellectuals the false ideas of "non-partisanship," "impartiality," "objectivism" in science, literature, and art, and the absolute "independence" of ideology from "practical life." Among the individual representatives of Soviet intellectuals, there are still believers in this type of thinking to this day.
    In this way, the advanced new things in all aspects of social life and national life encounter various manifestations of inertia, fatigue, conservatism, indifference to advanced new things, and sometimes even negation, on the part of individual conservatives on their way forward. The root of this backwardness lies in the power of tradition and habit. The remnants of capitalism in people's consciousness, which are supported and nurtured by the bourgeois world that is hostile to us, are the environment that cultivates this backwardness. In the thirty years since the birth of Soviet society, the formation of new consciousness has achieved great results. But to completely and finally eradicate all capitalist remnants in people's consciousness requires tenacious educational work and an active struggle for the victory of communist consciousness.
    The decisions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) on ideological issues—the decisions on the two magazines "Star" and "Leningrad," the decision on the programs performed in theaters, and the decision on the film "The Great Life"—played a huge role in the struggle against the hostile influence of ideology and culture, and in overcoming manifestations of indifference to politics and worshiping bourgeois culture. These decisions armed Soviet intellectuals to participate in the struggle to create such thoughtful and sublime literary and artistic works, the task of which is to educate Soviet people, especially young people, with the spirit of Soviet patriotism, with the spirit of joy and confidence in their own strength. In the struggle for the party spirit of science and philosophy, for the unfolding of criticism and self-criticism in scientific work, and for the proposal and study of new real problems, the discussion on Comrade Alexandrov's book "History of Western European Philosophy" based on the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) is of great significance. The Party's tireless attention to ideological issues and the struggle to overcome shortcomings and errors in ideological work are serving to victoriously solve the tasks of communist construction and victoriously promote the advancement of our society.
    Soviet society can only advance victoriously when it overcomes the contradictions between the new and the old.
    However, in socialist society, the path to overcome these contradictions and the forms of the struggle between the new and the old are fundamentally different from the situation in societies where antagonistic classes exist and the struggle between the new and the old is a struggle between antagonistic forces.

　　苏维埃社会条件下的新旧斗争　（中）
    夫约多洛夫作
    列宁斯大林党曾是新旧斗争的鼓舞者与组织者。党进行了反托洛茨基派的无情斗争。托洛茨基派曾推动工人阶级去与劳动农民分裂，力图为恢复地主与资本家的政权清除道路。党进行了反对右翼的资本主义恢复派的无情斗争。右翼的资本主义恢复派与剥削者达成了“和解”，为富农可以和平地生长到社会主义里去的资产阶级理论而辩护。党不倦地巩固了工人阶级领导下的工农联盟，并且在国家工业化、农业集体化与肃清剥削阶级等项政策基础上，引导工人与农民走向社会主义的胜利，走向社会主义社会的建立。
    实行党的政策的结果，从资本主义到社会主义的革命过渡时期存在于苏维埃社会里的基本矛盾解决了。苏维埃政权的两种基础之间——大规模的社会主义工业与小商品性农业经济之间——的矛盾解决了。两千五百万个的小农庄合并成了二十四万个大规模的社会主义农业企业——以最新的技术为基础的集体农庄。有私有观念的农民，变成了全新的阶级——集体农庄的农民。这便打破了存在了几千年的城市与乡村之间的对立。工人与农民成了统一的社会主义社会里的两支自由劳动者的部队。
    培植大部分是工农出身的全新的苏维埃知识分子与改造终于走到苏维埃政权方面了的旧知识分子阶层的工作，一方面使工人阶级与农民之间的友好关系巩固了，另一方面也使工人阶级与苏维埃知识分子之间的友好关系巩固了。苏维埃知识分子与自己的人民结合起来了。他们诚实地为人民的利益服务，成了社会主义社会里有平等权利的成员。
    社会主义的胜利，意味着一个全新的社会的建立。全新的社会经济基础，在世界史上第一次建立了，全部政治的与精神的生活也完全改建了，全新的国家制度也建立了。苏维埃国家，是有史以来第一个真正人民的国家。在苏维埃社会里，民主就是人民的民主。人与公民的面貌根本改变了：人民与国家的利益，成了苏联公民活动的最高道德规律。人们对于劳动的看法也有了根本的转变：在苏联，劳动从苛重的负担变成了荣耀、光荣、英勇与英雄主义的事情；劳动被社会承认为人的最高尚最高贵的使命。
    苏维埃社会，这是一个超过资本主义旧世界很远的新世界，是新的高级文化的世界。
    苏维埃社会发展的指导力量，是布尔什维克党——争取新东西战胜旧东西的斗争的发起者与组织者。布尔什维克党的世界观，乃是这样一种世界观：它不仅对过去给以科学的解释，而且也面对现在与将来。党在活动中，是以对于成熟中的历史需要的深刻知识，对于发展前途的明晰了解以及预见事件进程的能力来领导自己的。布尔什维克党不倦地培养着劳动人民的创造主动性。苏维埃社会里的革新者所提出的进步而有益于社会的新开端，被大力地拥护着，受着布尔什维克党与苏维埃国家方面的全面而切实的支持，苏维埃人民面前展开了迅速发展的无限前途。
    这是否意味着苏维埃社会的进展是以和谐的、顺利的、无阻碍的前进的方式进行的，没有磨擦，没有对困难的克服，没有新东西反对旧东西的斗争呢？自然不是的。
    斯大林同志教导说：“在我们的生活中，随时总有东西死去。但死去的东西不愿意轻易地死去，而要为自己的生存而斗争，要卫护自己已死去的事业。在我们的生活中，随时总有新东西出生。但出生的东西并不是轻易地出生的，而是在啸着，叫着，卫护着自己的生存权利。新旧之间、垂死与出生之间的斗争，便是我们发展的基础”。
    新旧斗争的基础究竟是些什么东西呢？这一斗争是在什么基础上产生的？以什么形式进行的？
    苏维埃社会条件下的新旧斗争
    社会主义的生产构成了苏维埃社会发展及其走向更高阶段的根本基础。斯大林同志教导说，社会主义生产的第一个特性，便在于它从来不长期地滞留在一点上，总是处在变化与发展的状态中。在生产手段私有为基础的社会条件下，改善某种生产工具与某种生产力因素的人们，并没想到这种改善应该带来一些什么社会结果，而只是想到自己的日常利益。在社会主义下，生产发展的社会结果是被人们认得清的，是为人们所奔赴的明白的目标而出现在人们眼前。苏维埃人民力图建立完善的共产主义社会，全国生产力的发展便是朝着这个目标的。遵照这个目标，布尔什维克党与苏维埃国家确定着并制定着苏维埃人民面前的经济任务。还在联共（布）党第十八次全国代表大会上，斯大林同志便制定了一整个历史时期的基本经济任务。斯大林同志说：
    “在生产技术与工业发展速度的意义上，我们已超过了各主要资本主义国家。这是很好的。但这还太少。我们在经济方面也应该超过他们。我们可以做到这一点，我们并且应该做到这一点。只有我们在经济上超过了各主要资本主义国家的情况下，我们才能预计我们国家将完全充满了消费品，我们将有丰裕的生产品，我们将有可能从共产主义的第一阶段过渡到第二阶段去”（见“列宁主义问题”第十一版第五七八页至五七九页）。
    基本的经济任务，具体地表现在各国民经济计划中。这些计划对生产发展及其过渡到更高阶段起着指导性的应响。在生产的面前，自觉地提出了新任务，显现了发展技术、组织生产过程、研究改善生产与提高劳动生产率的新方法等等更高的新要求。在为了胜利地解决这些新任务的斗争中，劳动人民的创造主动性发挥了，劳动人民使生产从已达到的阶段走向更高的阶段。但随着新东西的产生，也产生了新旧矛盾。
    在苏维埃社会里，新旧斗争出现为反对疲塌、惰性与墨守成规的斗争，为克服落后分子消极地有时也是积极地抵抗的斗争。
    在苏维埃社会里，计划经济制度胜利了。但自发的因素仍然存在，现在正在与这种因素进行着斗争。
    苏维埃社会条件下的新旧斗争
    工业、农业、运输业——苏维埃国民经济的一切部门，都正在迅速地前进着。生产中的革新者发明着更完善的机器与机械装置，采用着更适宜的劳动方法与新的生产过程组织形式。然而我们这里还有浸透了疲塌、墨守成规、惰性、保守主义的精神的人。这些人不仅自己不奔向革新，奔向大胆地研究新东西，奔向主动地创造，而且常常敌视有主动性与有创造性的人所创造着的一切新东西，敌对新东西，妨碍新东西的实行，墨守旧东西，从而成了进一步前进的阻碍。
    在苏维埃社会里，劳动成了荣耀的事情，英勇与英雄主义的事情。但还有躲避劳动的人存在。个别落后人群方面个人与社会的对立还没有完全消除。部分集体农庄庄员还有对自己个人的经济给予大部分注意的愿望，而损害了公共的经济。
    这种情况也存在于社会生活的一切其他方面——在道德、生活习惯、文化各方面。在这里，带头前进的新东西，碰上了落后因素的惰性与疲塌。旧东西的残余还存在于社会生活的一切方面。我们的社会，更是在为完全克服旧东西的残余而与之斗争中前进的。
    在苏维埃社会里，创立了全新的国家制度。这一国家制度是以最广大的人民群众最积极地参加政治生活为基础的。然而在我们这里，还有深染了小市民与资产阶级式个人主义的敌视社会主义精神的人。旧东西的残余也表现在官僚主义上。在国家机关甚至党机关的个别环节中的个别工作人员方面，官僚主义还没有根绝。还有这样一种工作人员，他们变成了傲慢的官僚，以高傲与轻蔑的态度对待“平民”，集疲塌与墨守成规、官僚主义与形式主义于一身。
    墨守旧东西，也表现在思想的活动范围中。在我们的知识分子中，有人还没有放弃崇拜资产阶级文化的奴性表现，做了科学、哲学、伦理学与美学上久已死亡的旧倾向与旧观点的俘虏。
    还有人对于科学中新问题的提出是陌生的，做了教条主义的俘虏，害怕把理论向前推进。在哲学家中，常常有人对马克思主义出世以前的哲学采取不批判的态度，夸大这种哲学的代表者的功绩，完全不懂得哲学史上标志了马克思主义哲学出现的那一革命性飞跃的深度。在文学与艺术问题上，在美学问题上，存在着反对和敌对苏维埃文学与苏维埃艺术的不关心政治的表现。在伦理学方面，常常可见旧意识显现于人们家庭生活的非共产主义行为中，以及与民族友爱的苏维埃思想意识不可并立的民族主义残余中………。
    还没有消除若干苏维埃知识分子从旧的贵族知识分子与资产阶级知识分子那里所承继的、卑下的、赞扬外国文化与低估伟大俄罗斯文化在世界历史上的意义的现象。个别的人还不懂得苏维埃文化胜过现代资产阶级文化的优越性。
    苏维埃社会条件下的新旧斗争
    千百年来，占统治地位的各种剥削阶级为了掩饰自己思想意识的贩卖性与牟利性，灌输知识分子以科学、文学、艺术的“无党性”、“无偏袒”、“客观主义”、以及思想意识绝对“独立”于“实际生活”之外等虚妄思想。在苏维埃知识分子的个别代表中，这一类思想至今仍然还有其信徒。
    这样，社会生活与国家生活一切方面的先进的新东西，在自己前进的道路上便遇见了个别守旧者方面惰性、疲塌、墨守成规、对先进的新东西抱冷淡态度甚至有时候抱否定态度的种种表现。这一落后性的根源便在于传统与习惯的力量中。敌视我们的资产阶级世界所支持与薰陶的、人们意识中资本主义的残余，便是培养这一落后性的环境。在苏维埃社会出世以来的三十年中，新意识的形成已达到了巨大的成绩。但要完全而最后地根绝人们意识中的一切资本主义残余，便需要有顽强的教育工作与为共产主义觉悟的胜利的积极斗争。
    联共（布）党中央委员会关于思想意识问题的各决定——关于“星”与“列宁格勒”两杂志的决定、关于剧院上演的节目的决定、关于“伟大的生活”影片的决定，在反对思想意识与文化方面的敌视影响的斗争中，在克服不关心政治与拜倒于资产阶级文化面前的表现上，起了巨大的作用。这些决定武装了苏维埃知识分子去参加为创造这样一种有思想的崇高文学作品与艺术作品的斗争，这种文学作品与艺术作品的任务，便是用苏维埃爱国主义的精神，用愉快与确信自己力量的精神来教育苏维埃人们，特别是青年。在为科学与哲学的党性、为展开科学工作中的批评与自我批评、为提出并研究新的现实问题的斗争中，根据联共（布）党中央委员会指示就亚力山德罗夫同志所著“西欧哲学史”一书所进行的讨论，具有很大的意义。党对于思想意识问题的不倦的注意与为克服思想意识的工作中的缺点与错误的斗争，正在为胜利地解决共产主义建设任务与胜利地推动我们社会前进而服务。
    苏维埃社会只有在克服新旧矛盾的时候，才可以胜利地前进。
    然而在社会主义社会里，克服这些矛盾的道路与新旧斗争的形式，与有敌对阶级存在、新旧斗争是敌对力量斗争的社会里的情况，有着原则上的不同。
