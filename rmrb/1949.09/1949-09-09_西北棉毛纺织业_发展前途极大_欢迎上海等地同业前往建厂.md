　　Northwest Cotton and Wool Textile Industry
　　Great Development Prospects
　　Shanghai and Other Industry Members Welcome to Establish Factories

　　(Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 8th) The liberation of Xi'an and Lanzhou has opened up a rich new field for the cotton and wool textile industry. At the recent Xi'an All-Circles Representatives Conference, a proposal was made on the issue of developing the Northwest cotton and wool textile industry, requesting the People's Government to consult with relevant parties to move a portion of spindles and looms from Shanghai and other places to the Northwest to establish new factories or expand existing ones. It is reported that this proposal will be submitted to relevant parties for research, planning, and implementation. Recently, the Northwest People's Textile Construction Company also gathered several experts to discuss the plan for developing the Northwest textile industry and issued a telegram welcoming the relocation of the textile industry from Shanghai and other places. The telegram expressed concern and respect for the arduous struggle of cotton and wool textile industry colleagues in Shanghai and other places against the blockade by imperialism and the Kuomintang bandit gang. At the same time, it invited them to move some spindles and looms to the Northwest to set up factories near the production areas, to achieve the goal of developing production for the benefit of both the public and private sectors. The Northwest People's Textile Construction Company also expressed its willingness to make its best efforts to assist in this relocation work. It is reported that the Northwest is rich in cotton and wool. Among them, Shaanxi cotton is of excellent quality, with an average annual output of more than one million dan. The annual output of raw wool is about 400,000 dan. However, the Northwest currently has less than 100,000 spindles, and the Lanzhou Wool Textile Factory has only more than 2,000 wool spindles. According to this equipment, the annual demand for raw cotton is only about 300,000 dan, and the demand for raw wool is less than 10,000 dan. Therefore, in the past, most of the cotton and wool raw materials in the Northwest were exported, while cotton and wool textile factories in other places were far from the raw material production areas, making round-trip transportation extremely uneconomical. According to general expert estimates, if Shaanxi Province expands its spindles to 300,000, there will be no problem with the supply of raw materials and labor or the sales of products. Therefore, the large-scale development of the Northwest wool textile industry has even broader prospects.

### 西北棉毛纺织业　发展前途极大　欢迎上海等地同业前往建厂

　　西北棉毛纺织业
  　发展前途极大
  　欢迎上海等地同业前往建厂
    【新华社西安八日电】西安、兰州的解放，给棉毛纺织工业开拓了一块富饶的新园地。不久前召开的西安各界代表会议中，曾对发展西北棉毛纺织业问题有一项提案，请求人民政府商请有关各方面由上海等地迁移一部分纺锭织机到西北，筹设新厂或增装现有各厂。据悉，这一提案将分别送交有关方面研究筹划进行。最近西北人民纺织建设公司又集合若干专家，研讨发展西北纺织工业方案，并发出欢迎上海等地纺织工业内迁的通电一份。该电对上海等地棉毛纺织同业与帝国主义和国民党匪帮的封锁进行艰巨斗争表示关怀和敬意，同时邀请他们迁移部分纱锭织机来西北，就产地设厂，以达到发展生产公私两利的目的。西北人民纺织建设公司并表示愿尽最大努力协助此种迁移工作。按西北盛产棉花、羊毛。其中陕西棉花品质优良，每年平均产量在一百万担以上。原毛每年出产约四十万担。但西北现有纱锭则不足十万枚，兰州毛纺厂的毛纺锭只有两千多枚。按此设备，每年仅需原棉约三十万担，原毛需要量则不足一万担。因此过去西北棉毛原料大部是输出，而外地棉毛纺织厂则远离原料产地，往返运输，极不经济。据一般专家估计，陕西省如扩充纱锭至三十万枚，无论是原料和劳动力的供应或产品的销路都不成问题。因此，西北毛纺织业的大量发展，前途更是十分广阔。
