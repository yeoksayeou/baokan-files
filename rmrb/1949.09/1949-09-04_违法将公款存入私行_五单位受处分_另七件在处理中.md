Illegally Depositing Public Funds into Private Banks
　　Five Units Punished
　　Seven Other Cases Under Review

[Our Newspaper News] From April to August, the People's Bank of Peiping Branch discovered twelve instances of military and government organizations and state-owned enterprises violating policies and regulations by depositing public funds into private banks and financial institutions. Among them, five units, including the Peiping Film Service Department, have been punished accordingly, and the other seven cases are still under review. The North China People's Government, in order to rationally utilize national funds and stabilize the financial market, explicitly stipulated that all deposits from military and government organizations, public schools, and state-owned enterprises must be deposited into state banks, and private banks and financial institutions are not allowed to absorb such public funds. The Peiping Branch of the People's Bank also issued a circular on April 14th of this year, ordering all private banks and financial institutions in Peiping not to absorb such deposits. However, in recent months, some military and government organizations and state-owned enterprises have still deposited public funds directly or under assumed names into private banks and financial institutions. At the same time, a small number of banks and financial institutions have deliberately violated government laws and regulations and adopted various methods to absorb public funds. In order to implement this regulation and prevent national funds from flowing into the speculative market, the Peiping Branch of the People's Bank began conducting continuous investigations into various banks and financial institutions in April of this year. As of the end of August, it had discovered twelve such deposits, with a total deposit amount of over 31,565,100 RMB. Among them, the deposit amount of the Chahar Daily was the largest, totaling over 17,800,000 RMB. The banks and financial institutions that absorbed these public funds include China Agriculture and Industry Bank, the Mainland Bank (including the Wangfujing branch), Jin Cheng Bank (West and South City offices), Da Zhong Bank, and the Yong Zeng, Quan Ju Hou, Yi Ju, and Heng Tai pawnshops. According to the bank's investigation materials, among the twelve cases of depositing public funds into private banks and financial institutions, except for a few that were due to ignorance of the legal regulations, most were due to the heads or handlers of the relevant agencies seeking higher interest rates from private banks and financial institutions, focusing only on local interests, and disregarding policies and regulations. As of the end of August, five of the twelve illegal deposit cases have been processed: Comrade Sha Ding of the Northwest Administrative Office Education Department brought 750,000 RMB to Peiping in June to purchase books, first depositing the money in the People's Bank, and then depositing it in the Mainland Bank because the prepared book payment was not used; Cao Cheng of the Directly Subordinate Smelting Plant of the East China Finance Office Industrial and Mining Department deposited 1,350,000 RMB of public funds for shipping cement into the China Agriculture and Industry Bank. The above two items were due to ignorance of the law, and with the approval of the Peiping Municipal People's Government and other agencies, the original deposits have been returned, and the interest has been confiscated. The Peiping Film Service Department deposited 283,400 RMB of public funds into the China Agriculture and Industry Bank, Ma Chi, Deputy Director of the Baoding Telecommunications Bureau, deposited 140,000 RMB of public funds into the Yong Zeng pawnshop, and Tian Song of the Materials Section of the Logistics Department of the North China Military Region deposited 500,000 RMB of public funds for purchasing wood in Peiping into the Mainland Bank. All of these were illegal acts of seeking petty gains, and with the approval of the competent authorities, the principal and interest of the deposits were confiscated. The illegal case of the Peiping Film Service Department has also been transferred to the Peiping People's Court for handling.

　　The seven cases still under review include: 1,700,000 RMB of funds for purchasing automobile parts by the Special Mobile Corps were deposited into the South City Office of Jin Cheng Bank in the name of Lin Qian, introduced by Wan Yu Yong sack shop; 800,000 RMB of automobile repair fees and food expenses of a certain division headquarters were deposited into the West City Office of Jin Cheng Bank by Tian Qi, the clerk of the division; Fu Yanzeng of the Peiping Construction Bureau Quarry fabricated personal names and addresses, dividing 3,800,000 RMB of public funds into seven accounts and depositing them into the West City Office of Jin Cheng Bank; the General Store of the Jidong 14th Special Zone deposited 265,400 RMB of public funds into the Yi Ju pawnshop; the Supply Department of a certain division deposited 2,800,000 RMB of public funds into the Da Zhong Bank; Hu Qingrong, a purchasing agent of the Chahar Daily, colluded with the private merchant Baosheng Paper Company to deposit over 17,800,000 RMB of public funds into the Quan Ju Hou and Heng Tai pawnshops; Rong Jing'an of the Second Outer Branch of the Peiping Public Security Bureau deposited 800,000 RMB of public funds into the South City Office of Jin Cheng Bank. Among them, except for the illegal deposit case of the Chahar Daily, which has been handled by the court due to the seriousness of the circumstances, the other six items are being reviewed by the competent departments. As for the West City Office of Jin Cheng Bank, Yi Ju pawnshop, and Da Zhong Bank, which deliberately violated laws and regulations to absorb public funds, they have also received written criticism from the Peiping Branch of the People's Bank.
