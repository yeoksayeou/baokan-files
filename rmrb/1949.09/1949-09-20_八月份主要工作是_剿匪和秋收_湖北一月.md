　　The Main Tasks in August Were
  　Bandit Suppression and Autumn Harvest
  　Hubei in One Month
    In August, Hubei Province held two meetings of great significance. One was the Hubei Military Region Party Committee's Party Representative Conference held from July 29th to August 5th; the other was the first Provincial Party Representative Conference of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held from August 13th to 25th. The convening of both meetings was to discuss and implement the Central China Bureau of the CPC's work policy of bandit suppression, anti-local bullies, and mobilizing the masses. The former focused on summarizing past bandit suppression work and, based on the current situation, arranged future bandit suppression tasks; the latter analyzed in detail the specific situation in Hubei Province and unanimously agreed that the vast rural areas of Hubei are still controlled by bandits, special agents, and feudal forces such as landlord bullies, making it difficult to carry out much work and impossible to implement policies and decrees. Therefore, both meetings believed that bandit suppression and anti-local bullyism are the central tasks of the current work in Hubei and an unavoidable historical task. Based on the current specific conditions, the two meetings clearly stipulated that bandit suppression should be the focus first, combined with anti-local bully struggles, thereby mobilizing the masses in a step-by-step manner, carrying out various rural social reforms, and preparing conditions for the subsequent implementation of land reform. Both meetings pointed out that in order to complete the above tasks, rectifying the thinking of cadres and transforming and improving grassroots organizations of district and township governments are the primary links in promoting the current movement.
    August was the month when Hubei Province extensively launched bandit suppression mobilization. According to incomplete statistics from the early days of the province's liberation, there were about 28,000 bandits (excluding scattered bandits). The vast majority of these bandits were remnants of the Kuomintang bandit gangs and were controlled by special agents and local feudal forces. Since May, June, and July, through the joint efforts of the southward army and local armed forces, more than 12,000 bandits have been annihilated. After the Military Region Party Representative Conference decided to focus on bandit suppression in early August, the results of bandit suppression became more significant. In August alone, more than 9,600 bandits were annihilated.
    There were many serious problems in the past bandit suppression work. For example, the bandit suppression troops could not cooperate well with the local party and government organs, forming isolated operations by the troops; the junction areas of various provinces or counties did not contact each other; especially after bandit suppression achieved some victories, a general sense of complacency and numbness arose, neglecting in-depth pursuit, encirclement, annihilation, and mobilization of the masses to clear out bandits. Therefore, the bandits used these weaknesses to roam everywhere, either gathering in the mountainous areas or moving to the junction of several regions; the remaining bandits in the interior scattered and hid, colluding with local bullies; and even many bandits and bullies sneaked into the revolutionary ranks and engaged in secret sabotage. The two Communist Party representative conferences of the military region and the province both focused on reviewing the above situation, believing that it is necessary to strengthen the cooperation of all parties and cooperate in combat under the unified leadership of the Party.
    After the two meetings, the representatives from various places returned to convey and discuss the resolutions of the conference, conducted preliminary reviews and criticisms of various erroneous tendencies, summarized past achievements and experiences in bandit suppression, studied the current bandit situation, decided to redeploy and concentrate forces to suppress bandits, and at the same time launched a fierce political offensive against the bandits.
    According to the different development of work in various regions, different work steps were proposed, such as focusing on bandit suppression while combining anti-local bully struggles, or focusing on anti-local bullyism while combining the clearing of scattered bandits. For example, the Xiangyang Sub-district has entered the stage of generally clearing out scattered bandits and carrying out anti-local bully struggles, and the Jiangbei areas of Xiaogan Sub-district and Jingzhou and Mianyang Sub-districts, and most areas of Huanggang Sub-district are now likely to begin clearing scattered bandits and carrying out anti-local bully movements; however, in the Jiangnan areas of Daye, Jingzhou, and Mianyang Sub-districts, and parts of Huanggang, it is still necessary to vigorously suppress bandits.
    August was also the autumn harvest season in rural Hubei. Early rice began to be harvested in various places at the end of July, and late rice was also harvested by the end of August. Except for some areas that suffered reduced harvests due to floods, most areas in the province had an average yield of 80%. The famous "Yunluo Plain" (i.e., the area along the river in southeastern Hubei to the border with Hunan) had more than 90%. In order to protect and assist the masses in the autumn harvest, governments at all levels and local armed forces implemented a method of combining armed bandit suppression with labor production, on the one hand, eliminating bandits and special agents and thwarting their conspiracies to sabotage the autumn harvest, and on the other hand, taking turns going to the fields to help farmers harvest rice. The relationship between the army and the people has become more harmonious. Farmers are now enthusiastically busy threshing, milling rice, and preparing to pay the autumn public grain. In mid-August, the Hubei Provincial People's Government officially issued instructions for the autumn grain levy, and in late August, various places were busy arranging this work, deciding to start the levy in September. This autumn levy work is being carried out on the basis of the successful completion of the summer levy work in July, combined with the bandit suppression and anti-local bully movement, carrying out in-depth anti-concealment field struggles, and implementing a simpler progressive levy method through democratic appraisal, in order to further implement the policy of reasonable burden.
    In addition, in the areas along the Yangtze River and Xiang River, under the active leadership of the People's Government, the embankment repair project was completed, and the summer flood season was successfully overcome; only a few embankment sections in Mianyang, Huanggang, and other places were seriously damaged by the Kuomintang bandit gangs in the past, resulting in local flood areas. The provincial government has successively allocated 3.2 million catties of grain to relieve severely affected households and assist local disaster victims in production and self-rescue. In the disaster area of Mianyang, disaster victims have generally organized various production organizations such as spinning hemp, weaving nets, fishing, chopping firewood, and transporting salt; most of the flooded fields have been organized by farmers to drain the water and have been replanted with late rice and vegetables. The autumn flood season has now arrived, although the water level of the Yangtze River has not yet risen, all localities continue to repair the embankments to prevent autumn floods.

### 八月份主要工作是　剿匪和秋收　湖北一月

　　八月份主要工作是
  　剿匪和秋收
  　湖北一月
    八月份，湖北省召开了两个具有重大意义的会议。一个是中共湖北军区党委会于七月二十九日至八月五日召开的军区党代表会议；另一个是中共湖北省委会于八月十三日至二十五日召开的全省第一次党代表会议。两个会议的召开都是为了讨论贯彻中共中央华中局剿匪、反恶霸、发动群众的工作方针。前者着重总结了过去的剿匪工作，并根据当前情况布置了今后的剿匪任务；后者详细分析了湖北省的具体情况，一致认为湖北广大农村目前仍为土匪、特务及地主恶霸等封建势力所控制，以致许多工作难于开展，政策法令无法推行。因此，前后两次会议都认为剿匪、反恶霸是湖北当前工作的中心任务，而且是不可超越的历史任务。两个会议根据目前的具体条件，明确规定先以剿匪为重点，结合进行反恶霸斗争，从而有步骤地发动群众，进行各种农村社会改革工作，为以后实行土地改革准备条件。两次会议都指出：为了完成上述任务，整顿干部思想，改造与健全区乡政权基层组织，又是推动当前运动的首要环节。
    八月是湖北省广泛展开剿匪动员的月份。据全省解放初期的不完全统计，共有土匪（散匪未计在内）约二万八千余名。这些土匪绝大部分为国民党匪帮之残存武装及为特务、地方封建势力所操纵。自五、六、七三个月来，经南下大军及地方武装合力围剿，已歼匪一万二千余名，至八月初军区党代表会议决定采取重点剿匪后，剿匪成绩更为显著，八月份一个月内共歼匪达九千六百余名。
    过去剿匪工作中存在许多严重的问题。如剿匪部队与当地党政机关不能很好地配合，形成部队孤军作战；各省或县的结合区则互相不联系，有的部队把土匪赶出本区即算完成；特别是在剿匪稍微得到一些胜利之后，普遍产生自满麻痹思想，忽视深入追剿、围歼及发动群众清剿等艰苦的斗争。因此，各地土匪就利用这些弱点，到处流窜，不是聚结于山区，就是转到几个地区的结合部活动；内地的残匪则分散隐蔽起来，与当地恶霸勾结；甚至有不少土匪恶霸分子竟钻入革命阵营内部，从事暗中破坏。军区和省的两次共产党代表会议上，都曾着重地检讨了以上情况，认为必须加强各方面的配合，在党的一元化领导下协同作战。
    两个会议结束后，各地代表都回去传达和讨论了大会的决议，对各种错误倾向进行了初步检查批判，总结过去剿匪成绩和经验，研究当前的土匪情况，决定重新部署，集中力量进剿，同时向土匪展开猛烈的政治攻势。
    各地区根据工作发展的不同情况，提出了以剿匪为主而结合反恶霸斗争，或以反恶霸为主而结合清剿散匪等不同的工作步骤。例如襄阳分区已进入普遍清剿散匪和进行反恶霸斗争的阶段，孝感分区和荆州、沔阳等分区的江北地区、黄冈分区的大部地区目前已有可能开始清剿散匪和进行反恶霸运动；但在大冶、荆州、沔阳等分区江南地区及黄冈部分地区则仍须大力剿匪。
    八月份又是湖北农村的秋收季节。各地早稻七月底即已开始收割，晚稻至八月底也已收完。全省除部分地区因水灾歉收外，一般地区均有八成年景。著名的“云萝平原”（即湖北东南部沿江两岸至湖南接界地区）则在九成以上。各级人民政府与地方武装为了保护和协助群众秋收，都实行了武装剿匪和劳动生产结合的办法，一方面剿灭土匪特务，粉碎其破坏秋收的阴谋，一面轮流下田帮助农民割稻。军民关系益形融洽。农民们现正热烈地忙着打场、碾米，准备缴纳秋季公粮。在八月中旬，湖北省人民政府已正式颁布秋季征粮指示，八月下旬各地正忙着布置这一工作，决定在九月份开征。这次秋征工作是在七月夏征工作胜利完成的基础上展开，结合剿匪反恶霸运动，开展深入的反瞒田斗争，以民主评议方式，实行较简单的累进征收办法，以进一步贯彻合理负担政策。
    另外，在沿长江、襄河两岸地区，在人民政府积极领导下完成了堤岸抢修工程，胜利渡过了夏汛期；仅有沔阳、黄冈等少数堤段因过去被国民党匪帮破坏太重，致造成局部水灾区。省政府曾先后拨出粮食三百二十万斤，救济受灾严重的灾户，并扶助各地灾民生产自救。在沔阳灾区内，灾民已普遍组织起纺麻、织网、捕鱼、打柴、运盐等各种生产组织；大部被淹田亩经组织农民排除积水后，已抢种上晚稻和菜蔬等农作物。目前秋汛期已到，虽长江水位尚未见上涨，但各地都继续修补堤防，以预防秋汛。
