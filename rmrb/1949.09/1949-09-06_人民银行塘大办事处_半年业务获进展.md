　　Half-Year Operations Achieve Progress

    [Tangda News] The Tangda Office of the Tianjin Branch of the People's Bank of China, under the correct leadership of the branch and the efforts of all personnel, has achieved considerable results in its operations over the past six months under the general policy of developing production and promoting economic prosperity. The office was established on the third day after the liberation of Tangda, and within fourteen days, it had eliminated counterfeit currency and initially clarified the financial market. It exchanged more than 6.83 million yuan of pseudo-gold yuan coupons, 50 percent of which were exchanged by employees and poor citizens at preferential exchange rates. Subsequently, the office provided small loans based on the original production of citizens. Over the past six months, a total of 6.38 million yuan in small loans were issued to 992 households. The transportation of salt and alkali supported by the office played a significant role in the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas in the early days of liberation, and initially laid the foundation for mass cooperative management. During the spring plowing season, the office issued more than 54,000 yuan in agricultural loans, helping 26 poor farmers to reclaim wasteland, purchase seeds, and add farm tools.

    However, before the end of April, the office's work focused on small loans, and other businesses were not vigorously developed, resulting in losses at one time. Later, the office reviewed its failure to delve deeply into the work and its simple relief perspective, and decided to vigorously promote business in the future. Industrial loans were issued seasonally, and real savings deposits were launched, with a total of 47 million yuan in industrial loans issued successively. April and May were the time when salt marshes needed mats, and the office provided loans to support the mat weaving industry in Tangda. May is the peak season for yellow croaker and Mandarin fish, and the office issued 130,000 yuan in fishing loans to support 23 fishing households and fish shops. The number of real deposit accounts also increased month by month, with a total of 243 households and 2,384 units in April, and increasing to 320 households and 3,462 units by early August. In addition, in order to attract deposits and reduce the trouble of cash sales for various public and private enterprises and trade departments, the office has established overdraft relationships and collection services with various public and private enterprises and trade departments.

　　人民银行塘大办事处
  　半年业务获进展
    【塘大讯】中国人民银行天津分行塘大办事处，半年来由于分行的正确领导和全体人员的努力，在发展生产、繁荣经济的总方针下，业务已获得相当成绩。该处成立于塘大解放后第三日，十四天就肃清了伪币，初步澄清了金融市场。共兑入伪金元券六百八十三万余元，其中百分之五十是职工和贫苦市民按优待比价兑换的。接着，该处在市民原有的生产基础上，举办小本贷款，半年来共贷出小本贷款六百三十八万元，贷给九百九十二户；该处所扶植的运输盐碱，在解放初期的城乡物资交流上起了相当的作用，初步打下了群众合作经营的基础，在春耕期间，该处曾发放农贷五万四千余元，帮助二十六户贫苦农民开荒、购买种籽、添置农具等。
    但在四月底以前，该处工作偏重在小本贷款，其他业务未大力开展，所以一度亏累。后来检讨了工作不深入和单纯的救济观点等，并决定今后大力推广业务。按季节性发放工贷，开展折实储蓄，计先后共贷出工贷四千七百万元。四、五月份正是盐滩需要席子的时候，该处贷款扶植了塘大的织席业；五月盛产黄花鱼、脍鱼，该处发出渔贷十三万余元，扶助渔户、鱼店共二十三家。折实存款户数也逐月增加，四月份共二四三户，二、三八四单位，到八月上旬就已增加到三二○户，三、四六二单位。此外，该处为了吸收存款，减少各公私企业和贸易部门售货时点款的麻烦，与各公私企业及贸易部门建立了透支关系及代收业务。
