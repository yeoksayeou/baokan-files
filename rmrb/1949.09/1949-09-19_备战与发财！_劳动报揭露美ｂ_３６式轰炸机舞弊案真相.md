　　Preparing for War and Getting Rich!
  　Labor Daily Exposes the Truth of the U.S. B-36 Bomber Scandal
    【Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 17th】 TASS, Moscow: The Labor Daily published an article by Ivanov entitled "Who Gets Rich in the American Arms Race." The article stated: The B-36 bomber "case" has attracted the attention of the general public in the United States. Involved in this "case" are high-ranking figures such as U.S. Secretary of Defense Johnson, Secretary of the Air Force Symington, and other important officials. The mutual attacks in the newspapers centered on this "case" exposed the relationship between U.S. government officials and Wall Street, and to a certain extent, clearly indicated the main reasons for America's war hysteria and the sources of income for some government bigwigs. Johnson's appointment as U.S. Secretary of Defense marked the beginning of what American newspapers called "a real war between the U.S. Air Force and the Navy." In fact, this was a "war" between competing corporations, which were attempting to grab as much money as possible from the U.S. military expenditure of 15 billion U.S. dollars in this fiscal year. It was precisely due to these "military-theoretical" considerations that some people touted the B-36 bomber as a global weapon for winning the war, while others praised aircraft carriers and their onboard aircraft. This matter did not stop at the mutual infighting in the newspapers between competing corporations. Some rather disgraceful events were also revealed. The whole incident smacked of a major fraud. Congressman Vinson, a member of the House Armed Services Committee, stated in Congress: There is a widespread "shocking rumor" that Johnson, Symington, and others were involved in the B-36 bomber manufacturing contract. But nothing came of it afterward. The committee quickly declared that the accused Johnson, Symington, and other figures had been "cleared of all suspicion." The committee has decided to engage in the purely theoretical issue of "determining the status of the Air Force and Navy in the war" next month, which will more appropriately maintain the prestige of U.S. government officials and the monopoly capitalists manipulating behind the scenes. Ivanov concluded that in the struggle between competing aircraft manufacturing companies and shipbuilding companies, Johnson was a victor, and if it was a victory won as a military leader, it would be better to say that it was a victory won as the former president of the Consolidated Vultee Aircraft Corporation. The manufacturers standing under the golden alms of American military spending certainly have reason to celebrate their victory.

  　劳动报揭露美Ｂ—３６式轰炸机舞弊案真相
    【新华社北平十七日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：劳动报登载伊凡诺夫的题为“谁在美国军备竞赛中发财”的论文，该文写道：Ｂ—３６式轰炸机“案件”引起美国一般社会的注意。牵涉在这个“案件”中的，是些高级的人物，如美国防部长詹森、空军部长薛明顿等要员。报纸上以这个“案件”为中心的互相抨击，暴露了美政府官员与华尔街之间的关系，并在一定程度上，明白地指明了美国的战争歇斯底里的主要原因所在和若干政府大员们的收入来源。詹森被任命为美国防部长，即是美报之所谓“美空军与海军间的真正战争”的开始，事实上这就是互相竞争的企业公司间的“战争”，这些企业公司企图在本财政年度美军费一百五十亿美元中尽可能地多捞一笔钱。正是由于这种“军事理论”上的考虑，使得若干人们鼓吹Ｂ—３６式轰炸机为赢得战争的寰球性的武器，而其他的人们则夸奖航空母舰及舰上的飞机。这件事并不止于那些互相竞争企业公司间在报纸上的倾轧而已。一些颇为不体面的事件也显露出来了。整个事件带有大舞弊的意味。众院军委会委员范展特曾在国会声称：此间盛传一个“可惊的谣言”说詹森、薛明顿等曾染指于Ｂ—３６式轰炸机制造合同。但这件事以后就没有下文了。该委员会赶快声明说：受控告的詹森、薛明顿及其他人物已“被洗清了所有的嫌疑”。该委员会已决定在下月中从事关于“确定空军及海军在战争中的地位”这一纯理论的问题，这样就更为妥当地保持了美政府大员们及幕后操纵的垄断资本家的威信。伊凡诺夫结论称：在互相竞争的飞机制造公司及造船公司间的争斗中，詹森是一个胜利者，如果说那是以一个军事领袖的地位所获的胜利，倒不如说那是以沃尔梯飞机制造总公司的前任总理的身份所获的胜利。站在美国军费的黄金布施下的制造商们确有庆祝胜利的理由。
