　　General Deng Baoshan Speaks of His Thoughts
　　A Record of a Visit with a Specially Invited Representative to the CPPCC

　　General Deng Baoshan, who recently arrived in Beiping from Suiyuan with General Fu Zuoyi to attend the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, expressed the following thoughts regarding his attendance at the CPPCC when he met with reporters on the 22nd:

　　The opening of the People's Political Consultative Conference marks an unprecedented unity of the Chinese people. The birth of a new China not only means that the 475 million Chinese people have begun to build their own peaceful, democratic, and happy lives, but also adds a powerful new force to the world peace camp.

　　Unity and peace have always been the goals I have pursued for decades, and my only wish. In the past, I worked in various positions, always hoping that the Kuomintang could seek unity and peace for the Chinese people. However, under the rule of the reactionaries controlling the Kuomintang, I was naturally only disappointed. Watching them betray Dr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary policies, antagonize the people, and drag China into a desperate situation, I felt infinitely saddened.

　　After the old Political Consultative Conference was torn up by the reactionaries, I once wanted to break away from the shackles of the reactionaries and stand on the side of the people, but due to internal contradictions, I never resolutely made up my mind. This is a great regret.

　　I am grateful for the broad-minded policies of Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and the Chinese Communist Party, which enabled the peaceful liberation of Beiping. During the liberation process, I was fortunate to be able to do my best to alleviate my mental burden, which I personally find very comforting. Recently, I assisted Mr. Fu Zuoyi in the Sui-Bao area, earnestly explaining the true meaning of the Chinese revolution to the officers and soldiers who had worked with me in the past, as well as Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu's painstaking efforts to "treat people with kindness," encouraging them to resolutely awaken and join the revolutionary camp. Everyone was very moved and expressed their willingness to perform meritorious service and start anew. From the perspective of the people, this is also my duty.

　　Yesterday, I returned from Suiyuan and participated in the People's Political Consultative Conference in the afternoon. Seeing the harmonious and enthusiastic atmosphere inside the venue, it was as if I had seen a united and peaceful new China, and I felt indescribably happy. I am willing to do some practical things that are beneficial to the people, to the best of my ability, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party in the future.

　　邓宝珊将军谈感想
  　人民政协特邀代表访问记
    新近偕傅作义将军由绥远抵平参加中国人民政治协商会议的邓宝珊将军，在二十二日接见记者时，发表此次出席人民政协的感想如下：
    人民政治协商会议的揭幕，是中国人民空前的大团结。一个新中国的诞生，不仅意味着四万万七千五百万中国人民开始着手建设自己的和平、民主、幸福的生活，而且使世界和平阵营平添了一支强大的生力军。
    团结、和平，一向是我几十年来追求的目标，也是我唯一的愿望。过去，我在各种不同的岗位上工作，一直希望国民党能够为中国人民谋取团结与和平，然而，在以反动派操纵着的国民党统治之下，我自然只有失望。眼看着他们背叛孙中山先生革命的政策，与人民为敌，把中国拖到山穷水尽的绝境，真是感到无限的痛心。
    在旧政协会议被反动派撕毁以后，我曾经想脱离反动派的羁绊，站到人民这边来，但由于内心的矛盾，始终没有毅然决然的下决心，这真是极大的遗憾。
    感谢毛主席、朱总司令和中国共产党的宽大政策，使北平能够和平解放；而在解放的过程中，我幸而能够竭尽微力，借以减轻我精神上的负担，这在我个人是觉得非常安慰的。最近协助傅作义先生到绥包一带，曾对过去和我共事的官兵恳切说明中国革命的真义，以及毛主席、朱总司令“与人为善”的苦心，鼓励他们毅然觉悟，参加革命阵营，大家都很感动，表示愿意立功自新。就人民的立场来说，这也是我应尽的责任。
    昨天，我从绥远回来，下午参加了人民政治协商会议，见到会场内部融洽、热烈的气氛，就象见到了一个团结和平的新中国，感到说不出的愉快。我愿意今后在毛主席和中国共产党领导之下，就我的能力所及，切切实实的做一些有利于人民的事。
