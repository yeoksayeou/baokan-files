　　Deputy Secretary-General of the Preparatory Committee
  　Lin Boqu Reports on the Preparatory Process

    Lin Boqu, Deputy Secretary-General of the Preparatory Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, reported on the preparatory process of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference at the second meeting of the plenary session. The report is divided into four parts, with the following main points:

    (1) The Initiation of the New Political Consultative Conference

    All Parties and Groups Enthusiastically Responded to the CCP's "May 1st" Slogan

    In October 1947, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, based on the consistent advocacy of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong over the years, issued a declaration proposing: "Unite the workers, peasants, soldiers, students, businessmen, and all oppressed classes, all people's organizations, all democratic parties, all minority nationalities, overseas Chinese, and other patriotic elements to form a national united front, overthrow the Chiang Kai-shek dictatorial government, and establish a democratic coalition government." In December of the same year, Chairman Mao reiterated this program in his report to the CCP Central Committee meeting. This proclamation by Chairman Mao further consolidated and developed the national united front in China, laying the foundation for the subsequent response of all parties and factions to the CCP's May 1st slogan.

    On May 1, 1948, the CCP Central Committee, in the slogans it issued, called on "all democratic parties, all people's organizations, and social notables to promptly convene a new Political Consultative Conference, discuss and realize the convocation of a People's Congress, and establish a democratic coalition government." After this call was made, it immediately received enthusiastic responses and support from all democratic parties, people's organizations, non-party democratic人士, minority nationalities, and overseas Chinese.

    (2) The Establishment of the Preparatory Committee of the New Political Consultative Conference

    The New Political Consultative Conference Preparatory Committee Was Established on a Solid and United Political Basis

    Starting in August 1948, representatives of various democratic parties and democratic strata successively arrived in the Liberated Areas from all over the country and overseas. On November 25 of the same year, the representatives of the CCP Central Committee and the democratic人士 who had arrived in Harbin reached the following agreement on the establishment of the Preparatory Committee of the New Political Consultative Conference and the nature and tasks of the New Political Consultative Conference.

    Regarding the Preparatory Committee of the New Political Consultative Conference, it was decided: 1. It would be composed of representatives from a total of twenty-three units, including the CCP and the major democratic parties, people's organizations, and non-party democratic人士 who supported the CCP Central Committee's May 1st slogan; 2. The tasks of the Preparatory Committee of the New Political Consultative Conference were to: be responsible for inviting representatives from all parties to participate in the New Political Consultative Conference, be responsible for drafting the documents of the New Political Consultative Conference, and be responsible for convening the official meeting of the New Political Consultative Conference; 3. The organizational regulations of the Preparatory Committee would be drafted by the CCP and sent to all parties for review, and officially adopted when the Preparatory Committee met.

    Regarding the nature and tasks of the New Political Consultative Conference, it was decided: 1. The scope of participation in the New Political Consultative Conference would be composed of representatives from various democratic parties, people's organizations, and non-party democratic人士 who opposed American imperialist aggression, opposed the Kuomintang reactionary rule, and opposed feudalism and bureaucratic capital oppression. All reactionary parties and reactionary elements under the Nanjing reactionary government system must be excluded and not allowed to participate; 2. The time for holding the New Political Consultative Conference was set for 1949, with the specific time and place to be determined by the Preparatory Committee; 3. The New Political Consultative Conference should discuss and implement two issues: the formulation of a common program and the establishment of the Central Government of the People's Republic of China.

    After the completion of the November 25th agreement, the domestic situation had undergone new and fundamental changes. Following the great victory of the autumn offensive in 1948, especially the complete liberation of the Northeast, the People's Liberation Army also achieved a decisive victory in the Huaihai Campaign. The main force of the Kuomintang was completely wiped out north of the Yangtze River, and the final victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War on a national scale was undoubtedly only a matter of time. This unprecedented victorious situation urgently demanded that the people of the whole country "carry the revolution through to the end." In order to adapt to this new situation and to defeat the peace offensive of the Kuomintang reactionaries sheltered by American imperialism, Chairman Mao Zedong of the CCP Central Committee issued the "Statement on the Current Situation" on January 14, 1949, proposing eight conditions. The democratic parties and democratic人士 who had arrived in the Liberated Areas declared their unanimous support for these calls, and the democratic parties and democratic人士 outside the Liberated Areas also expressed the same. Everyone unanimously recognized the CCP's call as the common political basis for the united struggle of the people of the whole country. In this way, the success of the New Political Consultative Conference was further guaranteed.

    In the first half of 1949, the heroic People's Liberation Army liberated the central cities of the country such as Beiping, Tianjin, Hankou, Nanjing, Shanghai, and Taiyuan. The Kuomintang reactionaries had basically been overthrown, and what remained was only the task of eliminating the reactionary remnants. On the other hand, after unifying the country, the issue of how to use the greatest strength to restore and develop the people's economic, cultural, and educational undertakings and consolidate national defense was put on the agenda. In order to undertake these two major tasks, it was necessary to quickly complete all necessary preparations and convene the New Political Consultative Conference as soon as possible to establish a democratic coalition government. On this solid and united political basis, and under the conditions that the time was completely ripe, after consultations among all parties, the Preparatory Committee of the New Political Consultative Conference was officially established in Beiping on June 15.

    (3) Overview of Preparatory Work in the Past Three Months

    After Three Months of Serious and Intense Work, Three Important Drafts Were Formulated

    The inaugural meeting of the Preparatory Committee of the New Political Consultative Conference, which was also the first plenary meeting, lasted for a total of five days. A total of twenty-three units and one hundred and thirty-four people attended, including the original proposers of the New Political Consultative Conference, the Chinese Communist Party, and the democratic parties, people's organizations, democratic人士, domestic minority nationalities, and overseas Chinese representatives who supported this proposition of the CCP. The "Organizational Regulations of the Preparatory Committee of the New Political Consultative Conference" were unanimously adopted, and the Standing Committee was elected according to these regulations to be responsible for handling regular work. Mao Zedong was elected as the chairman, and Zhou Enlai, Li Jishen, Shen Junru, Guo Moruo, and Chen Shutong were elected as the vice-chairmen, and Li Weihan was elected as the secretary-general.

    In order to quickly complete all necessary preparatory work for convening the New Political Consultative Conference and establishing a democratic coalition government, the Preparatory Committee decided to establish six groups under the leadership of the Standing Committee to complete the following tasks respectively: 1. Drafting the units and their representative quotas to participate in the New Political Consultative Conference; 2. Drafting the Organizational Regulations of the New Political Consultative Conference; 3. Drafting the Common Program; 4. Drafting the Program for the Government of the People's Republic of China; 5. Drafting the Declaration; 6. Drafting the Program for the National Flag, National Anthem, and National Emblem.

    Before the closing of the inaugural meeting, the first group drafted the document "Regulations on the Units Participating in the New Political Consultative Conference and Their Representative Quotas," which decided that the units and their representative quotas participating in the New Political Consultative Conference would be: fourteen party representatives, one hundred and forty-two people, nine regional representatives, one hundred and two people, six military representatives, sixty people, sixteen group representatives, two hundred and six people, In addition, a special invited unit was established, and its representative qualifications, quotas, and candidates were to be negotiated separately by the Standing Committee. This regulation was approved by the plenary meeting.

    After the closing of the inaugural meeting of the Preparatory Committee, all preparatory work continued to be undertaken by the Standing Committee and the above-mentioned five groups separately. The focus of the preparatory work was placed on three aspects: the first was to draft various documents of the New Political Consultative Conference; the second was to promote and facilitate the preparatory work of national social science, natural science, education, news, and other people's organizations, and assisted in the establishment of the National Federation of Literary and Art Workers; and the third was to negotiate the list of representatives of each unit in accordance with the "Regulations on the Units Participating in the New Political Consultative Conference and Their Representative Quotas" adopted by the first plenary meeting of the Preparatory Committee.

    After nearly three months of intense work, the above-mentioned three tasks have been completed in succession in September. Before the finalization of each document, the Standing Committee, the drafting groups, and the representatives of the Preparatory Committee in Beiping and the representatives who arrived in Beiping successively to participate in the first plenary meeting of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference repeatedly studied and carefully discussed them. Therefore, the Standing Committee convened the second plenary meeting of the Preparatory Committee of the New Political Consultative Conference on September 17. At this meeting, the following documents were reviewed and basically approved: 1. Draft of the Organizational Law of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference; 2. Draft of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference; 3. Draft of the Organization of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China. As for the two tasks of drafting the draft declaration of the first plenary meeting of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and drafting the proposal for the national flag, national emblem patterns, and national anthem lyrics and scores, because they have not yet been completed, the meeting decided to transfer these two tasks to the presidium of the first plenary meeting of the People's Political Consultative Conference, and the two groups originally responsible for these two tasks would submit reports to the presidium of the first plenary meeting of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. In addition, this meeting also approved the report of the Standing Committee of the Preparatory Committee on the preparatory work.

    (4) Regarding the Decision on the "List of Representatives of the First Plenary Meeting of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference"

    The List of All Representatives Was Drafted with a Very Cautious and Serious Attitude

    The Preparatory Committee handled the issue of the units participating in the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and their representative quotas and candidates with a very cautious and serious attitude. The list drafted by the Preparatory Committee is divided into five categories. In addition to the four categories mentioned above, with a total of forty-five units, five hundred and ten representatives, and seventy-seven alternate representatives, the fifth category is specially invited representatives, which were determined to be seventy-five people after consultation between the Standing Committee of the Preparatory Committee and all parties.

　　筹备会代理秘书长
  　林伯渠报告筹备经过
    【新华社北平二十二日电】中国人民政治协商会议筹备会代理秘书长林伯渠在全体会议第二天会议上报告了中国人民政治协商会议筹备经过。报告分四部分，要点如下：
    （一）新政治协商会议发起经过
    中共“五一”口号发表后各党派团体热烈响应
    一九四七年十月，中国人民解放军根据中国共产党及毛泽东主席多年来的一贯主张，发表宣言，提出：“联合工农兵学商各被压迫阶级，各人民团体，各民主党派，各少数民族，各地华侨及其他爱国分子，组成民族统一战线，打倒蒋介石独裁政府，成立民主联合政府。”同年十二月，毛主席在对中共中央会议的报告中，再度重申这个纲领。毛主席的这个文告，使中国的民族统一战线获得进一步的巩固和发展，为后来各党各派响应中共五一口号奠定了基础。
    一九四八年五月一日中共中央在发布的口号中号召“各民主党派、各人民团体及社会贤达，迅速召开新的政治协商会议，讨论并实现召集人民代表大会，成立民主联合政府。”这个号召提出之后，立即得到各民主党派、各人民团体、无党派民主人士、少数民族、海外华侨热烈的响应和赞成。
    （二）新政治协商会议筹备会成立经过
    在坚固团结的政治基础上成立了新政协筹备会
    从一九四八年八月开始，代表各民主党派和各民主阶层的人士，从全国各地以及海外陆续来到解放区。同年十一月二十五日，中共中央的代表人与已经到达哈尔滨的民主人士，对于成立新政协筹备会及新政协的性质任务等问题，获得如下的协议。
    关于新政协筹备会，决定：一、由中共及赞成中共中央五一口号的各主要民主党派，人民团体及无党派民主人士等共计二十三个单位的代表组成；二、新政协筹备会的任务为：负责邀请参加新政协的各方代表人物，负责起草新政协的文件，负责召开新政协的正式会议；三、筹备会组织条例推由中共起草送各方审阅，经同意后，俟筹备会集会时正式通过。
    关于新政协的性质及任务等问题，决定：一、新政协参加范围，由反对美帝国主义侵略、反对国民党反动统治、反对封建主义和官僚资本压迫的各民主党派、各人民团体及无党派民主人士的代表人物组成，南京反动政府系统下的一切反动党派及反动分子必须排除，不许参加；二、新政协举行时间定在一九四九年，具体时间及地点由筹备会决定；三、新政协应讨论和实现的问题有二：一是共同纲领的制定，一是中华人民共和国中央政府的建立。
    十一月二十五日协议完成之后，国内形势已起了新的根本变化。继一九四八年秋季攻势的大捷，特别是东北的完全解放，人民解放军又获得了淮海战役的决定性的大胜利。国民党主力在长江以北被完全消灭，中国人民解放战争在全国范围内的最后胜利，谁都不能不承认只是时间问题了。这一个空前胜利的形势，迫切地要求全国人民“将革命进行到底”。为了适应这一新的形势，并且为了击破美帝国主义卵翼的国民党反动派的和平攻势，中共中央毛泽东主席发表了一九四九年一月十四日的“关于时局的声明”，提出八项条件。对于这些号召，已经到达解放区的民主党派与民主人士声明一致支持，解放区以外的民主党派与民主人士也有同样的表示。大家一致承认中共的号召为全国人民团结奋斗的共同政治基础。这样，就使得新政治协商会议的成功，有了进一步的保证。
    一九四九年的头半年，英勇的人民解放军解放了北平、天津、汉口、南京、上海、太原等全国的中心大城市，国民党反动派基本上已被打倒，剩下来的只是消灭反动残余的问题。在另一方面，统一全国之后，如何用最大力量来恢复与发展人民经济文化教育等事业及巩固国防的问题，被提上了日程。为了担负这两大任务，就必须迅速完成各项必要的准备工作，尽早召开新的政治协商会议，成立民主联合政府。在这样坚固团结的政治基础之上，在时机业已完全成熟的条件之下，经各方协商之后，新政协筹备会于六月十五日在北平宣告正式成立。
    （三）三个月来筹备工作概况
    经过三个月严肃紧张的工作拟定三项重要草案
    新政协筹备会成立会，亦即第一次全体会议，一共进行了五天，出席的计有新政协原提议人中国共产党与赞成中共此项主张的各民主党派、各人民团体、各界民主人士，国内少数民族和海外华侨代表人物等，一共是二十三个单位，一百三十四人。全体一致通过了“新政协筹备会组织条例”，并根据这个条例选出了常务委员会，负责办理经常工作。常委会推毛泽东为主任，周恩来、李济深、沈钧儒、郭沫若、陈叔通等为副主任，李维汉为秘书长。
    为了迅速完成召开新政协及建立民主联合政府的各项必要准备工作，筹备会决定在常务委员会领导下设立六个小组，分别完成下列各项任务，即：一、拟定参加新政治协商会议的单位及其代表名额；二、起草新政治协商会议组织条例；三、起草共同纲领；四、拟定中华人民民主共和国政府方案；五、起草宣言；六、拟定国旗、国歌及国徽方案。
    在成立会闭幕之前，第一小组即拟定了“关于参加新政治协商会议的单位及其代表名额的规定”的文件，决定参加新政协会议的单位及其代表名额为：党派代表十四个单位，一百四十二人，区域代表九单位，一百零二人，军队代表六单位，六十人，团体代表十六个单位，二百零六人，此外，另设一特别邀请单位，其代表资格、名额与人选由常委会另行协议。这个规定获得全体大会的通过。
    筹备会成立会闭幕后，一切筹备的工作继续由常务委员会和上述五个小组分别担负起来。筹备工作的重心是放在三方面上：其一是拟定新政治协商会议的各种文件；其二是推动并促成全国社会科学、自然科学、教育、新闻等人民团体的筹备工作，并协助了全国文学艺术工作者联合会的成立；其三是根据筹备会首次全体会议所通过的“关于参加新政治协商会议的单位及其代表名额的规定”，协商各单位的代表名单。
    经过将近三个月的紧张工作，上述三项工作都已于九月次第完成。各项文件在定稿以前，均经常委会和起草的各小组，以及在北平的筹备会代表和陆续到达北平参加中国人民政协第一届全体会议的代表们，反复研究，缜密商讨。于是常委会即于九月十七日召开新政协筹备会第二次全体会议。在这一次会议中，审议并基本通过下列各项文件：一、中国人民政治协商会议组织法草案；二、中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领草案；三、中华人民共和国中央人民政府组织草案。至于起草中国人民政治协商会议第一届全体会议宣言草案及拟订国旗、国徽图案及国歌词谱建议案等两项工作，则因尚未完成，会议决定把这两项任务移交给人民政协第一届全体会议，并由原来负责该两项工作的两个小组向中国人民政协第一届全体会议主席团提出报告。此外，这一次会议并批准了筹备会常委会关于筹备工作的报告。
    （四）关于“中国人民政治协商会议第一届全体会议代表名单”的
    决定的经过
    以非常慎重严肃的态度拟定了全体代表名单
    对于参加中国人民政治协商会议的单位及其代表名额与人选的问题，筹备会是用非常慎重严肃的态度来处理的。筹备会所拟订的名单分为五类。除前项所述四类共四十五个单位，代表五百一十人，候补代表七十七人外，第五类为特别邀请代表，经筹备会常委会与各方面协商定为七十五人。
