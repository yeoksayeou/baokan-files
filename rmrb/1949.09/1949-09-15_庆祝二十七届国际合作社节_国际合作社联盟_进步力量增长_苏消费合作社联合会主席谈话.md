Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 14th: Moscow dispatch: September 11th marked the 27th International Cooperative Day, and all 30 member countries of the International Cooperative Alliance held commemorations. Ivan Kokhlov, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Soviet Consumers' Cooperative Union, recently spoke to a TASS reporter on this matter, pointing out the victory of peace and democratic forces in the international cooperative movement. Kokhlov stated: Last year was a year of development for progressive forces within the International Cooperative Alliance. As a result, the International Cooperative Alliance held its 17th Congress in Prague last September. During the congress, the Soviet representatives, with the active support of the cooperatives of the People's Democratic countries, criticized the reactionary leadership of the Alliance for not taking every opportunity to fight for lasting peace and democracy in the struggle against the reactionary leadership of the Alliance. The Soviet delegation exposed the disastrous impact of the Marshall Plan on the cooperatives of Western European countries. It pointed out that this "plan" was making the lives of consumers and working people increasingly worse. As a result, the congress unanimously adopted an appeal calling on cooperative members of all countries to fight for peace and democracy and to strengthen the international cooperative movement. Although the proposal of the Soviet, Czech, Polish, and Bulgarian cooperatives to participate in the World Peace Congress was rejected, the Soviet delegation's proposal to abolish the notorious politically neutral clause in the Alliance's constitution was victorious, and the congress made an addition to the constitution, namely, that cooperatives of all countries should fight for lasting peace and democratic cooperation between countries.
　　At the meetings of the Central Committee of the International Cooperative Alliance held in Stockholm at the end of June this year, a program of international cooperative activities was adopted, stipulating that the most important tasks of the Alliance are: to fight for the unification of the cooperative movement at the national and international level and against division; cooperative organizations should participate in all undertakings that guarantee the economic and social rights of working people; to eliminate all discrimination based on race, nationality, party affiliation, and religious belief; and to take active action in defending peace, striving for democratic cooperation between countries, and opposing all forms of fascism.

    苏消费合作社联合会主席谈话
    【新华社北平十四日电】莫斯科讯：九月十一日是第廿七届国际合作社节，国际合作社联盟的三十个会员国都举行纪念。苏联消费合作社中央联合会委员会主席伊凡·贺何洛夫顷就此事对塔斯社记者发表谈话，指出和平民主力量在国际合作社运动中的胜利。贺氏称：去年是国际合作社联盟中进步力量发展的一年。结果，国际合作社联盟于去年九月在布拉格举行了第十七次代表大会。在大会上所进行的反对该联盟反动领导机构的斗争中，苏联代表得到人民民主国家合作社的积极支持，批评了该联盟中央委员会不利用一切机会进行争取持久和平与民主的斗争。苏联代表团在大会上揭露了马歇尔计划对西欧各国合作社灾难性的影响。指出这个“计划”使消费者和劳动人民的生活日益恶化。结果，大会一致通过了号召各国合作社社员为和平民主、为加强国际合作社运动而斗争的呼吁书。尽管苏、捷、波、保合作社所提关于参加世界拥护和平大会的建议被否决了，但苏联代表团提议取消联盟章程中声名狼籍的政治上中立一项条款，却获得了胜利，并使大会对该章程作了一项补充，即各国合作社应为持久和平与民主国家合作而斗争。
    今年六月底在斯德哥尔摩举行的国际合作社中央委员会的各次会议上，又通过了国际合作社活动的纲领，规定联盟的最主要任务是：为争取各国国内与国际范围合作社运动的统一、反对分裂而斗争；各合作社组织应参加一切保证劳动人民经济与社会权利的事业；消灭一切基于种族、国籍、党派和宗教信仰的歧视；在保卫和平、争取各国间民主合作和反对一切形式的法西斯主义斗争中，积极行动。
