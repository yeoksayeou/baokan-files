Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 24th: According to TASS, Budapest: On the 21st, the Hungarian State Chief Prosecutor, Gyula Alapi, spoke at the People's Court, summarizing the trial of the treason case:

	Respectable people's judges: The trial of Rajk and his accomplices for treason over the past week has aroused great reactions among the Hungarian working people, international friends, and foreign enemies. This trial is of international importance. The judgment to be announced will not only be a judgment against the defendants who have infringed upon the state system and great achievements of the Hungarian People's Republic, but also against those foreign imperialist enemies' tools and puppets who oppose the Hungarian working people building socialism. Sitting in the dock are not only Rajk and his accomplices, but also their foreign masters, their instigators—the imperialists in Belgrade and Washington.

	Nagy and his conspirators, who were previously tried by the People's Court, and Mindszenty, who has already been punished, are all deadly enemies of the Hungarian People's Democratic Republic. However, the Rajk group are even more dangerous and hateful enemies because they attack secretly and conspire under the guise of hypocrisy. The Rajk group are also servants of foreign imperialists. However, the prominent feature of the Rajk case trial is that the Tito gang, which is currently oppressing the heroic people of Yugoslavia, appears as the main agent of imperialism, as the transmitter of imperialist orders, and as the offensive detachment of imperialism.

	According to the trial materials, the defendants' confessions, the witnesses' testimonies, and the results of the confrontation, the assertions in the indictment have been fully proven, and the truth has been revealed. The defendants defended themselves very freely, and at the same time, some defendants explained the same thing from different perspectives. The confrontations arranged by the court also confirmed the occasional subtle contradictions in the defendants' confessions.

	Rajk and Brankov essentially described in the same way the so-called "strategic" plan of the Tito elements to undermine the people's democracy from within and instigate opposition to the Soviet Union, as well as the role of the Tito group in this plan. The purpose of the Tito group has always been the same, only their methods of struggle have changed after the publication of the Cominform resolution.

The Confessions of Rajk and Seven Other Criminals Prove They Are American Imperialist Spies

	The trial not only confirmed the accusations in the indictment, but also obtained some new facts that were not included in the indictment and were not confirmed during the investigation. For example, Brankov confessed that the American imperialist and Tito's intelligence agencies colluded not only in all people's democratic countries to carry out subversive activities, but also in some capitalist countries with strong labor movements and influential communist parties to carry out activities. Brankov also confessed that after the coup in Hungary, the Tito faction assigned tasks to Antal Bán, the right-wing Social Democratic leader who fled abroad in 1948. According to Rajk's confession about the conversations in Kellebia and Ranković, it can be seen that the Tito group pursued an anti-Soviet policy even during the war and after the war. Only after the socialist forces in the people's democratic countries repeatedly打击ed the reactionary forces, making it impossible for the reactionaries in these countries to seize power, did the Yugoslav leaders turn to an open anti-Soviet policy. Rajk confessed that Ranković told him in the Bucks meeting about isolating and strangling democratic Greece, which is completely consistent with all the events that have occurred since then as a result of the establishment of a united front between the Tito elements and the Greek royalist fascists against the Greek freedom fighters. Rajk's confession about the Bucks meeting also revealed the general preparation of the Greek royalist fascists and Tito fascists to abolish Albania's independence and divide and "merge" Albania.

	Alapi then listed the facts confirmed in the trial, and separately described the confessions of the eight criminals Rajk, Barfé, Brankov, Zönni, Szalai, Ognyenovics, Kolondi, and Justus, which fully conformed to the crimes charged, proving that they were spies, conspirators, assassins, and imperialist-hired spies.

	Alapi said: In order to pronounce the defendants' guilt, it is not enough to understand their crimes, but it is necessary to understand the political background of this conspiracy, its purpose and essence, and it is necessary to understand all the political connections of this conspiracy so that we can fully judge the defendants' crimes.

The Traitors Conspired with the Tito Group to Subvert Democratic Hungary

	The trial has shown that their political purpose is to restore capitalism in Hungary and restore the rule of landlords and capitalists. Rajk tried his best to prevent the democratic and socialist forces from defeating the Hungarian reactionary forces. Later, when the democratic forces led by the working class won and moved towards socialism, they conspired an armed coup, attempting to form a government led by Rajk after the coup, uniting all kinds of reactionaries, from right-wing social democrats to the followers of Nagy and Mindszenty, to abolish the people's democracy, abolish nationalization, and cancel land reform.

	This Rajk government would also be a fascist government that would use bloody terror to massacre the people and destroy the fruits of democracy. The army used for the coup would not only consist of troops composed of Horthy officers, but also former Csalaszi gendarmerie troops. Rajk's "political ABC" is to enslave the working masses and kill thousands of their outstanding representatives. This is the fascist ABC that Rajk learned from his teachers and masters—Tito.

	It is also very clear that the Rajk group's conspiracy aimed at selling out national independence and eliminating Hungarian national sovereignty. They wanted to turn Hungary into a foreign colony, and the government would be composed of foreign lackeys and spies. Tito wanted to transfer the Yugoslav army to Hungary to carry out a coup. Tito also wanted to command the Hungarian army, with Yugoslav officers commanding Hungarian officers, and Yugoslavia having higher authority over Hungary.

	Every Hungarian worker with patriotic dignity will clench his fists when he hears this despicable plan that insults our national honor. Tito's arrogant plan will never succeed, but they seriously thought about it! From these shameful facts, we can best estimate how the Western imperialist newspapers and radio stations try to portray Rajk as a representative of the "national line." The representative of the "national line" in the eyes of American and British imperialism is a person who has sold his country to foreign imperialism in whole or in part for eighteen years by means of informing and betraying!

	The Rajk group's attempt to sell out Hungarian independence was to forcibly pull our country out of the strong democratic and peaceful camp and to oppose the Soviet Union. They are enemies of the Soviet Union because they know exactly that the Soviet Union is the main pillar of Hungary's peace and independence. They concentrated their efforts on weakening the powerful Workers' Party of the working people because the party is the organizer of all the victories of the Hungarian working people and the defender of the country. They clearly knew that to subvert the people's democratic country, they must destroy the party and kill the party leaders. Our working people are angered by this evil plan, realizing that those who plot to murder the party and Rákosi are those who want to destroy our people's regime, our people's prosperity and happiness.

	The international significance of this trial lies precisely in the fact that we announce the verdict on the Yugoslav traitors. The trial revealed that the Tito group is mostly agents of the American imperialist intelligence agencies. Many striking evidences prove that Tito's collusion with imperialism has older roots. As early as during the war, the Tito group had contact with American and British imperialism, carrying out anti-Soviet struggles. The struggle against Jujović and Hebrang was Tito's struggle against the truly patriotic elements of Yugoslavia in order to ensure their power in the country and the party after the war. This exposed the entire role of Tito, Kardelj, Đilas, Ranković, etc. in the Yugoslav guerrilla war. Many facts in the defendant's confession prove that the current leaders of Yugoslavia are mostly connected with the intelligence agencies of the United States, Britain, and France. Rajk was given to Ranković by Himmler. The Tito group used imperialist spy methods in Hungary, turning the Hungarian embassy into the center of a treasonous conspiracy, hiring spies from Horthy intelligence officers and traitors, sending assassins to Hungary, carrying out assassinations, forging documents, and later organizing armed coups and provoking border incidents. The gist of these political plans is that Tito wants to establish an anti-Soviet group of Balkan countries serving imperialism. The Tito group's policy includes two stages: First, before the outcome of the struggle between the bourgeois reactionary forces and the people's democratic forces in Eastern European countries is determined, the Tito elements remain latent. Second, after the democratic and socialist forces in Eastern European countries have achieved a decisive victory, they appear as an anti-Soviet vanguard. This is just like Yugoslavia "lurking" in the first few years of the war, and then openly appearing as an imperialist vanguard. Rajk was not a central figure in the first stage, but Rajk temporarily became an important figure when the United States and Tito could no longer rely on Nagy and Mindszenty. When Rajk planned to assassinate Rákosi, he also prepared to deceive the Hungarian working people, planning to stretch the assassin's hand to the Soviet Union in order to drag Hungary out of the path of Hungarian-Soviet friendship.

The Trial Proved That the Tito Group Is an Imperialist Intelligence Agency

	The trial has also proven the subversive activities carried out by Yugoslav spies in Poland, Romania, Czechoslovakia, and Albania.

	The trial further revealed the espionage activities of Tito's masters—the American imperialists. As early as during the war against Hitler, the American imperialist intelligence agencies were preparing to fight against democratic and socialist forces, and the method was to carry out sabotage from within. Now, American Colonel Kovac claims that he has never met Rajk, and former US ambassador to Hungary Chapin claims that he has not talked to Rajk about Tito's plan, but their policies and actions have proven the opposite! Are the fascist forces of Kisbarnas-Fargas still staying in the American-occupied zone of Austria? If it were not for the purposes revealed in the trial, why would they keep these people? Allen Dulles' brother, Foster Dulles, issued a statement in the spring of 1948 about the American imperialist "X Action" to launch underground movements in people's democratic countries. The Swiss newspaper "Neue Zürcher Zeitung" said on April 26, 1949, that the content of this plan was: The West first tried to establish contact with the ruling class cadres and prominent representatives of the people's democratic countries, and it is said that they have achieved unexpected success. These few words summarize all the materials of the trial. The trial tore off the veil covering the implementation of the American imperialist plan, and also tore off the veil of the "precious" American democratic purpose, allowing people to see that the American "democracy" is precisely the fascist method used by Hitler and Horthy. American imperialism is the host and author of Tito's political program and their coup plot. Even during the war against Hitler, the American and British intelligence agencies cultivated Tito elements, hindered the national and social liberation of the peoples of Southeast Europe, isolated the Soviet Union, and prepared for the Third World War. The Hungarian coup plan cannot be separated from the American imperialist international plan. Rajk's so-called "waiting for an opportunity" to launch a coup meant waiting for the opportunity when the Soviet Union was attracted by other things. The coup was "determined to be suitable" between February and June 1949. The international situation at that time was: on the eve of the Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference, the conflict artificially planned around the Berlin Airlift and the intensified anti-Soviet Cold War were suitable for Ranković and Rajk's plan to surround the Soviet Union. The Hungarian Republic's arrest of the traitors in May foiled an important part of the war-mongers' international policy. The People's Court's verdict on the defendants will help to further prevent the realization of the war-mongers' aggression plan. The trial and verdict constitute a part of the struggle waged by the democratic and socialist forces to win peace and oppose war-mongers. The issue is to ruthlessly eliminate the Hungarian agents of the war-mongers and the fifth column of imperialism.

The Only Way to Defend Against Mad Dogs Is to Destroy Them

	Who are the defendants? They are just ordinary spies. Some of them were originally fascists who hated the people, and some were involved in the working-class movement, but because of cowardice and lack of principles, they became traitors after the first trial. Some people in Western European countries asked: How can there be so many traitors in the working-class party? It is strange that the people who raise this question are the most qualified to answer this question. The newspapers of the imperialist trust spy agencies ask us about these traitors, but it is they who send spies to undermine the revolutionary movement from within! But why hasn't the working-class party been able to expose these traitors immediately? As long as we have the archives including the list, but the Hungarian police archives were then dominated by the American spy agencies! Many people ask us why this trial only establishes facts and does not pay attention to the psychology of the defendants. My opinion is that the main thing in the trial of treason cases is behavior, not psychological motives, but it is not difficult to explain the spiritual evolution and psychological situation of the defendants. They became traitors because they were cowards and unprincipled people, because they were not able to sacrifice; they did not stop being traitors because they were in the hands of their masters, afraid of exposure, and dared not reveal their ugly deeds; they pleaded guilty, did not deny, and did not try to defend themselves because they were exposed and they knew that denial was useless. They did not repent, but were only afraid of punishment; they confessed not because of repentance, but because of exposure. There are no conditions to reduce their guilt, only conditions to aggravate their guilt.

	Our people demand the death penalty for these criminals. As the representative of the prosecution, I agree with this demand. The heads of the poisonous snakes must be crushed. Such a verdict will let every imperialist agent and traitor see what awaits him. There is only one way to defend against mad dogs: destroy them!

	Let the People's Court realize in its verdict that its highest duty is to protect the people from the poison of the fifth column serving imperialism. The interests of the people require that all defendants be given the most severe sentence prescribed by law.

	After the prosecutor's speech, the court listened to the defense lawyers' speeches.

	After listening to the defense lawyers' speeches, the court adjourned.

　　匈人民一致要求处死叛贼
  　匈国家检察署长总结叛国案审讯
    【新华社北平二十四日电】据塔斯社布达佩斯讯：二十一日，匈牙利国家检察署署长齐犹拉·阿拉庇在人民法庭上发言，总结叛国案的审讯称：
    可尊敬的人民法官们：一周来对拉伊克及其同谋叛国者的审讯，已在匈牙利劳动人民，国际友人和外国敌人中间引起了巨大反应。这一审讯是具有国际的重要性的，即将宣布的判决，不仅是对侵害匈牙利人民共和国国家制度和伟大成就的被告们的判决，而且也是对那些为建设社会主义的匈牙利劳动人民之外国帝国主义敌人的工具傀儡们的判决。坐在被告席上的，不仅是拉伊克及其同谋者，而且也就是他们的外国主子，他们的唆使者——贝尔格莱德和华盛顿的帝国主义者。
    以前为人民法庭审判的奈基及其阴谋者，和业已受到惩罚的明曾蒂，都是匈牙利人民民主国家的死敌，但拉伊克们却是更危险更可恶的敌人，因为他们是偷偷摸摸地进行攻击，是在表里不一的掩护下进行阴谋的。拉伊克们也是外国帝国主义者的奴仆，但是对于拉伊克案审讯的显著特色，就在于目前压迫着英勇的南斯拉夫人民的铁托匪帮，是作为帝国主义的主要代理人，作为帝国主义命令的传达者，作为帝国主义的进攻支队而出现的。
    根据审讯的材料、被告的供词、证人的证言和对质的结果，完全证明了起诉书上的断言，真相业已昭然若揭了。被告曾十分自由地为他们自己辩护，同时某些被告都各自在不同方面说明同一件事。法庭所安排的对质也确定了被告供辞中偶尔发生的细微矛盾。
    拉伊克与布兰科夫实质上都是完全相同地叙述了铁托分子从内部破坏人民民主并唆使反对苏联为目的的所谓“战略”计划，以及铁托集团在这一计划中担任的角色。铁托集团的目的前后都是一样，只是在情报局决议发表后，他们的斗争方法才有所改变。
    拉伊克等八犯的招供证明他们是美帝间谍
    在审讯中不仅证实了起诉书中的控告，而且还得到起诉书中所没有的、且在调查期间也未确定的若干新事实。例如布兰科夫供出美帝国主义和铁托的谍报机关不仅在所有人民民主国家勾结进行颠覆活动，而且也在若干有强大劳工运动，有在广大群众中具有影响的共产党的资本主义国家中勾结着进行活动。布兰科夫又供出：在匈牙利举行政变后成立的新政府中，铁托派给右翼社会民主党领袖、一九四八年逃亡外国的安塔拉·班以任务。根据拉伊克在凯利比亚和兰科维奇谈话的供词，看出铁托集团在战后甚至在战争当中即奉行反苏政策，只有在人民民主国家内的社会主义力量一再打击了反动力量，使得这些国家内的反动派不再可能夺获政权之后，南斯拉夫的领袖们才转入公开的反苏政策。拉伊克供认兰科维奇在巴克斯会议中告诉他关于孤立及扼杀民主希腊的事，这和自那时以来由于铁托分子和希腊保皇法西斯建立反对希腊自由战士的统一战线之结果，所发生的一切事件完全符合。拉伊克对巴克斯会议的供词，又显露了希腊保皇法西斯和铁托法西斯取消阿尔巴尼亚的独立，瓜分“合并”阿尔巴尼亚的总的准备。
    阿拉庇继列举审讯中证实的事实，分述拉伊克、巴尔费、布兰科夫、佐恩尼、萨莱、奥格涅诺维区，科隆第、尤斯图斯八名罪犯的招供，完全符合于所控之罪名，证明他们是奸细，阴谋者，进行暗杀的匪徒，帝国主义雇用的间谍分子。
    阿拉庇称：为了要宣判被告的罪状，了解他们的罪行还是不够的，必须了解这一阴谋的政治背景，它的目的和实质，必须明白这一阴谋的一切政治联系，以便使我们能够充分判定被告的罪行。
    叛贼们勾结铁托集团阴谋颠覆民主匈牙利
    审讯业已说明：他们的政治目的是要使资本主义在匈牙利复辟，恢复地主和资本家的统治。拉伊克力求阻挠民主与社会主义力量战胜匈牙利反动力量，后来当工人阶级领导的民主力量获胜并迈向社会主义时，他们就阴谋武装政变，企图在政变后由拉伊克领导政府，纠合各色的反动派，从右翼社会民主党人到奈基和明曾蒂的党徒，取消人民民主，废除国有化，取消土地改革。
    这个拉伊克政府还将是会用血腥恐怖屠杀人民破坏民主果实的法西斯政府。用于政变的军队不仅有霍尔梯军官组成的部队，且有前查拉绥宪兵部队。拉伊克的“政治ＡＢＣ”，乃是奴役劳动群众并杀害他们千万优秀的代表，这就是拉伊克从他的老师和主子—铁托学习的法西斯ＡＢＣ。
    拉伊克分子的阴谋，旨在出卖民族独立和消灭匈牙利国家主权，也是很清楚的。他们要变匈牙利为外国殖民地，政府由外国的走狗和间谍组成。铁托要把南斯拉夫军队调到匈牙利来实行政变，铁托还要指挥匈牙利军队，南斯拉夫军官指挥匈牙利军官，南斯拉夫对匈牙利有较高的权威。
    每一个有爱国尊严情绪的匈牙利劳动者听到这种污辱我们民族名誉的卑劣计划时，都将握紧拳头。铁托们的狂妄计划永远不能成功，但他们却认真地这样想过！从这些可耻的事实，我们就能够最好地估量西方帝国主义的报纸和电台如何企图把拉伊克描绘成“民族路线”的代表，美英帝国主义心目中的“民族路线”的代表，就是十八年来以告密和出卖手段把他的国家零整批售给外国帝国主义的人物！
    拉伊克们企图出卖匈牙利独立，是要把我们的国家自有力的民主和平阵营中强拉出来，是要我们反对苏联。他们是苏联的敌人，因为他们确当地知道苏联是匈牙利和平与独立的主要支柱。他们集中力量削弱强大的劳动人民的工人党，是因为党是匈牙利劳动人民各种胜利的组织者与国家保卫者。他们清楚知道，要颠覆人民民主国家，必须摧毁党和杀死党的领袖们。我们劳动人民为这凶恶的计划所激怒，意识到谋害党和拉科西的人，就是要摧毁我们人民的政权，我们人民的昌盛和幸福的人。
    这一审讯的国际意义恰恰在于我们宣告对南斯拉夫叛徒的判决，审讯揭露了铁托集团大多数是美帝谍报机关的代理人，许多引人注目的证据证明：铁托和帝国主义的勾结有着更老的根源。早在战争期间，铁托集团便和美英帝国主义联系，进行反苏斗争，反对尤约维奇和海布朗的斗争，就是铁托反对南斯拉夫真正爱国分子的斗争，为的是以保证战后他们在国家和党内的权力，这就暴露了铁托、卡德尔、德热拉斯、兰科维奇等人在南斯拉夫游击战争中的全部作用。被告的供词中许多事实证明南斯拉夫现在的领导人物，大都和美、英、法等国谍报机关有联系，拉伊克便是希姆勒交给兰科维奇使用的。铁托集团把帝国主义的间谍方法用于匈牙利，把驻匈公使馆变成阴谋叛国的中心，从霍尔梯谍报员与奸细中雇用间谍人员，派遣刺客到匈牙利，进行暗杀，伪造文件，以后更组织武装政变，挑起边境事件。这些政治计划的要旨，就是铁托要建立为帝国主义服务的巴尔干国家反苏集团。铁托集团的政策包括两个阶级：第一，在东欧国家资产阶级反动势力与人民民主力量的斗争结果尚未确定前，铁托分子保持潜伏。第二，在东欧国家的民主与社会主义力量取得了决定性的胜利后，他们才以反苏挺进队的姿态出现。这正与南斯拉夫在战争的头几年中“潜伏”起来，后来才公然以帝国主义挺进队的出现一样。拉伊克在第一阶段也还不是中心人物，后来是在美帝和铁托不再能依靠奈基和明曾蒂的时候，拉伊克才暂时成为要角。拉伊克计划暗杀拉科西时，同时也准备欺骗匈牙利劳动人民，打算把刺客的手伸到苏联去，以便把匈牙利拖出匈苏友好之途。
    审讯证明了铁托集团是帝国主义间谍机关
    审讯又已证明：南斯拉夫间谍在波、罗、捷、阿尔巴尼亚所进行的颠覆活动。
    审讯更揭露了铁托的主子—美帝国主义者的间谍活动。早在对希特勒作战的时期，美帝谍报机关已准备着对民主和社会主义力量进行斗争了，方法是在内部进行破坏。现在，美国的科瓦克上校宣称他从未见过拉伊克，美前驻匈公使查平宣称他没有和拉伊克谈过铁托的计划，可是他们的政策与行为业已证明：恰恰与此相反！基斯巴纳斯——发加斯的法西斯队伍，是不是仍留在奥地利美占区呢？如果不是为了审讯中揭发了的目的，他们为什么还留住这些人？艾伦·杜勒斯的兄弟福斯特·杜勒斯于一九四八年春季发表了美帝在人民民主国家内发动地下运动的“Ｘ行动”的声明。瑞士实事报于一九四九年四月二十六日说出这一计划的内容称：西方首先试图与人民民主国家的统治阶级的干部和著名代表建立联系，而且据说已获得超乎所料的成就。这几句话总结了审讯的一切材料，审讯把遮掩着美帝国主义计划实施的帷幕撕下来了，也撕下了“可贵的”美国民主之目的的帷幕，使人看到美国的“民主”正是为希特勒、霍尔梯所使用的法西斯方法，美帝国主义就是铁托的政治纲领和他们图谋政变的计划的主持人和作者。美英谍报机关甚至在对希特勒的战争时期，就培养铁托分子，阻挠东南欧各民族的民族与社会解放，孤立苏联和准备第三次大战。匈牙利政变计划是不能从美帝国主义的国际计划分开来的，拉伊克所谓“伺机”举行政变，就意味着等待苏联为别的事情吸引着的时机。政变“确定宜于”一九四九年二月到六月之间，那时的国际情势是：在巴黎外长会议前夕，围绕柏林空运而人为地筹划的冲突，与加剧了的反苏冷战，这就适合兰科维奇和拉伊克计划包围苏联的目的。匈牙利共和国五月逮捕了谋叛者，就挫败了战争贩子国际政策的一个重要部分。人民法庭对被告的判决，将有助于进一步阻止战争贩子侵略计划的实现。审讯和判决构成民主与社会主义力量所进行的争取和平反对战争贩子的斗争的一部分。问题就是无情地消灭战争贩子的匈牙利代理人、帝国主义的第五纵队。
    对疯狗的防卫办法只有把它们毁灭掉
    被告是些什么人呢？他们都是普通间谍而已。他们中间某些是原来就憎恨人民的法西斯主义者，有些则卷入工人阶级运动中，但因怯懦并缺乏原则，在第一次审讯后就成为叛卖者了。西欧国家的某些人士问道：工人阶级政党中怎样会有这么多叛卖者呢？奇怪的是提出这问题的人，刚刚是最够资格回答这问题的人。帝国主义托辣斯间谍机关的报纸问我们这些叛贼的事情，但正是他们派遣间谍来从内部破坏革命运动！但是为什么工人阶级政党没有能够立即揭露这些叛徒呢？只要我们手上有包括名单的档案就行了，但是匈牙利警察的档案那时却是受美国间谍机关支配的！许多人问我们，在这次审讯中为什么只确立事实而不注意被告的心理，我的意见是审理叛国案中主要的是行为，而不是心理动机，但要说明被告的精神演变和心理情况也并不困难，他们成为叛徒是因为他们是懦夫和无原则的人，因为他们不能够牺牲；他们不停止作叛徒，是由于他们掌握在他们主子手中，害怕暴露，不敢吐露丑事；他们认罪，没有否认也不企图辩护，是因为他们被揭发了，他们知道否认是没有用的。他们并未悔恨，只是害怕惩罚；他们招供不是由于悔过，而是由于揭露。没有减轻他们罪过的条件，只有加重罪过的条件。
    我国人民要求处死这些罪犯，我作为起诉人之代表，赞同这一要求，必须踏碎毒蛇的头。这样的判决书将使每一个帝国主义代理人和叛卖者看见什么在等着他。对疯狗，只有一种防卫方法：毁灭它们！
    让人民法庭在判决时认识到它最高的职责，是保卫人民免遭为帝国主义服务的第五纵队的毒手。人民的利益要求对一切被告的条件处以法律所规定的最严厉的判决。
    检察署长发言后，法庭听取被告的辩护士发言。
    在听取辩护士发言后，法庭即行退庭。
