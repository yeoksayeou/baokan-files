Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 13th. TASS Moscow dispatch: Leontief published a special article in New Times magazine entitled "The Disillusionment of the Myth of Western European Economic Recovery." He wrote: The Marshall Plan has suffered a double failure. First, the collapse of its officially declared goals is obvious. Second, it is equally clear that the real attempt of the policy specifically manifested by the Marshall Plan is also in a deep crisis.

The author wrote: The official goal of the Marshall Plan was "European economic recovery." The ruling groups of Western European countries, serving American monopoly capitalists, hoped to use their assistance to repair their chaotic situation. But the Marshall Plan's "support" for the Western European economy is only correct in one sense: the rope supports the person on the gallows.

At the end of last year, the crisis clearly began to form in the United States, and immediately spread to several Western European countries. At present, the impact of the crisis on Western European countries will undoubtedly be greatly accelerated and strengthened by the policy of Marshallization, because this policy has tied Western European countries to the war chariot of American imperialism. As a result, the fatal diseases of the American economy have a malignant impact on the economies of Western European countries. In the golden age of the Marshall Plan, its leaders repeatedly declared that it would enable Western European countries to firmly stand on their own feet within four years and cure their chronic dollar deficit. However, at the end of 1948 and the beginning of 1949, this hope suffered a severe blow: the so-called European Economic Cooperation Bureau reached a very sad conclusion, that is, when the plan ends, that is, by 1952, the dollar deficit of Western European countries will accumulate to about 3 billion US dollars per year. But the greater illusions of Marshallized countries were yet to be shattered.

The United Kingdom, which holds the first seat among the Marshallized countries, has been suffering from an increasing dollar deficit for several months. Financial issues occupy a prominent position in the Anglo-American quarrel. Some people concerned even tried to give these issues an exaggerated importance. The most vivid example is the statement of the Times. The newspaper editorial mentioned the House of Commons' debate on foreign policy on July 21, saying: There is a general impression that the "cold war" has melted due to the heat of the "dollar crisis."

The dollar crisis is a reflection of the UK's deep economic crisis. The change in the UK's position in the post-war world has caused a sharp decline in its overseas industries, shipping, and various other incomes. The chronic dollar shortage in Western Europe is caused by the entire foreign trade policy of the United States. On the one hand, the United States increased its exports to Western Europe, but on the other hand, it drastically reduced its imports from Western Europe. The dollar shortage in Western Europe has not only not been eliminated due to the implementation of the Marshall Plan, but has become more acute.

Leontief continued to write: The following fact is of great significance, that is, the result of the first year of the Marshall Plan implementation—1948—the rate of expansion of industrial output in almost all Western European countries has declined compared with 1947, when the Marshall Plan did not yet exist. Due to the reduction of industrial production, in the first few months of 1949, the number of unemployed people in all Western European countries rose sharply. In the first three months of this year, the number of unemployed people doubled, and in some countries even more than that.

The agricultural production of Western European countries is still far below the pre-war level. The output of grains from 1948 to 1949 was only about 87% of the annual average from 1934 to 1938. The relationship between the industrial and agricultural recession in Western Europe and the increasing unemployment and the implementation of the Marshall Plan can be seen with the naked eye. Under the Marshall Plan, goods from the United States flowed into Western Europe, mainly those that could not find a market in the United States. The massive import of unsalable and low-quality American goods into the already shrinking domestic market of Western Europe due to the poverty of the people is destroying and strangling local industry and agriculture. Not only that, the forced influx of American goods imposed on Western Europe also deprives them of their traditional foreign markets. Washington's policy of forcing Western Europe to sever trade relations with the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries has had a fatal impact on Western Europe. The trade of Marshallized countries with Eastern Europe in 1948 was only 48% of that in 1938. The lives of the working people of Western European countries have deteriorated sharply due to the implementation of the Marshall Plan. A United Nations report shows that in the vast majority of Western European countries, the prices of consumer goods continued to rise in 1948, while the increase in wages lagged far behind. The Oxford Institute of Statistics estimates that in the six months from November 1948 to May 1949, the price of the minimum amount of food required by an average family of five in the UK increased from 42 shillings and 6 pence per week to 48 shillings and 8 pence. In Scandinavian countries, the cost of living has increased by more than 50% compared with pre-war levels. According to recently published figures, the Dutch people reduced their purchases of bread and sweets by 15% in May 1949 compared with March, and their purchases of manufactured goods by 17%. The consumption of meat and butter has also been greatly reduced due to high prices. In June and July, the purchasing power of residents declined even further. In the first half of 1949, butter consumption decreased by 13% compared with the same period last year. In the occupied zones of West Germany, the vast majority of residents are trapped in terrible poverty and lack, while a few profiteers and tools of Anglo-American monopoly capital are fattened by the poverty of the people.

Leontief wrote in conclusion: The crisis of capitalist overproduction always shows the "poverty in abundance" picture. But this contradiction has never been as great as Western Europe faces today. Because the current crisis has grown up in a situation where the most destructive consequences of the war, such as inflation and the collapse of trade and credit, have not even been eliminated, and millions of people have been deprived of the most basic means of subsistence since the war.

### 西欧经济复兴神话的幻灭　里昂捷也夫在新时代杂志发表专文

　　西欧经济复兴神话的幻灭
　  里昂捷也夫在新时代杂志发表专文
    【新华社北平十三日电】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：里昂捷也夫在新时代杂志发表专文，题为“西欧经济复兴神话的幻灭”。他写道：马歇尔计划已受到了双重的失败。第一、其官方宣称的目标的崩溃已显而易见。第二、同样明显的，由马歇尔计划所具体表现的政策的真正企图也处在同样深刻的危机之中。
    作者写道：马歇尔计划的官方目标是“欧洲经济复兴”。西欧国家的统治集团为美国独占资本家服务，希望借他们的援助以修补自己混乱的状况。但马歇尔计划的对西欧经济的“支持”，只在一个意义上是对的，那就是：绳索支持绞架上的人。
    在去年年底，危机清楚地在美国开始形成，而立刻就扩展到好几个西欧国家内。目前，危机对于西欧国家的打击，将无疑地因马歇尔化的政策而大大加速和加强，因这一政策已将西欧国家系在美帝国主义的兵车上。结果是美国经济的致命的疾病对西欧国家的经济发生恶性的影响。在马歇尔计划的黄金时代，它的主持人们曾反复宣称，它将在四年以内使西欧国家稳固地自立，并治好它们的慢性美元亏空病。可是就在一九四八年底、四九年初的时候，这个希望已受到了严重的一击：所谓欧洲经济合作局得到了非常悲伤的结论，即当计划终止时，亦即到一九五二年时，西欧国家的美元赤字将积累至每年三十亿美元左右。但马歇尔化国家更大的幻想破灭还在后面。
    马歇尔化国家中坐第一把交椅的英国，数月来感受到日益增加的美元赤字的痛苦。财政问题在英美间的口角中占显著地位。某些有关的人士甚至企图给予这些问题过度夸张的重要性。最生动的例子就是泰唔士报的说法。该报社论提到下院七月二十一日关于外交政策的辩论称：一般有这样的印象，认为“冷战”已因“美元危机”的热气而融化了。
    美元危机是英国深刻的经济危机的反映。英国在战后世界中地位的改变，已使它自国外产业，航运业及其他各种收入急剧下降。西欧的慢性美元短缺是美国整个国外贸易政策所造成的。美国一方面增加它对西欧的输出，另一方面却剧烈地削减它自西欧的输入。西欧的美元短缺不仅未因马歇尔计划的实施而消除，反而更加尖锐起来。
    里昂捷也夫继续写道：下面的事实有很大的意义，即马歇尔计划实施第一年——一九四八——的结果，几乎所有西欧国家的工业出产量的扩增的速率，较之一九四七年马歇尔计划尚未存在之时，均形减退。由于削减工业生产，在一九四九年的头几个月，所有西欧国家的失业人数均急剧上升了。在本年的头三个月内，失业人数增加两倍，在某些国家内甚至比这还要多。
    西欧国家的农业生产量仍然远低于战前的水平。一九四八至一九四九年谷物的产量仅及一九三四至一九三八年每年平均量的约百分之八十七。工业农业的不景气情况及西欧不断增加的失业与马歇尔计划的实施之间的关系肉眼都可以看出。在马歇尔计划之下，货物自美国源源流入西欧，主要是那些在美国找不到销路的货物。没有销路和品质低劣的美国货大量输入因人民的穷困而已经缩小的西欧国内市场，这正破坏和绞杀当地的工业和农业。不仅如此，强迫加诸西欧的美货流入还剥夺它们传统的国外市场。华盛顿强迫西欧断绝与苏联及人民民主国家贸易关系的政策，对西欧产生致命的影响。马歇尔化国家在一九四八年对东欧的贸易仅及一九三八年的百分之四十八。西欧国家劳动人民生活因马歇尔计划的实施而急剧恶化。联合国报告显示，在绝大多数的西欧国家内消费品的价格于一九四八年仍然继续上涨，而工资增加的程度则大大地落后。牛津统计研究所估计，在一九四八年十一月至一九四九年五月这半年以内，英国一般五口之家所需的最低限度食物的价格自每星期四十二先令六便士增至四十八先令八便士。在斯堪的纳维亚国家内，生活费用较战前增高百分之五十以上。据最近发表的数字，荷兰人民在一九四九年五月较之三月对面包糖果的购买减少百分之十五，对制造品的购买则减少百分之十七。肉类及牛油的消费亦因价格的高涨而大大减低。六月和七月，居民的购买力更为低降。在一九四九年的上半年，牛油消费量较之去年同一时期减少百分之十三。在西德各占领区，绝大多数的居民陷于可怖的贫穷和匮乏，而少数的渔利者及英美独占资本的工具则因人民的贫困而肥壮起来。
    里昂捷也夫在结语中写道：资本主义生产过剩的危机永远现出“在富足中的贫困”的图书。但这个矛盾却从来不曾如西欧今日所面临的这样巨大。因为目前的危机是在这样的一种情况中长大的：战争的最具破坏性的后果如通货膨胀及贸易和信用的崩溃等甚至尚未消除，而千百万的人民自战争以后即被剥夺了维持生计的最基本手段。
