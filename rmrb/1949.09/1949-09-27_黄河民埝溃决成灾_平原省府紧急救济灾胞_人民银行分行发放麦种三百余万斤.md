　　【Xinxiang Dispatch】Following the collapse of the civil embankments along the Yellow River in Pingyuan Province, residents along the riverbed have suffered severely. The government is taking emergency measures to provide relief to those affected. On the 15th and 16th, all the civil embankments along the Yellow River in Pingyuan Province were breached. The Yan Shanren embankment in Shouzhang and Liangshan counties was also breached simultaneously. From Dongming and Changyuan in the west to Changqing in the east, and including Liangshan and Shouzhang counties, over 1,400 villages were flooded, affecting a total population of approximately 700,000. To provide urgent assistance, local Party and government departments, as well as the Stone Transportation Office and the Navigation Administration Bureau of the Yellow River Bureau, dispatched all available vessels. Local governments also organized civilian boats for rescue efforts, prioritizing saving lives and then transporting resources. As a result, most of the disaster victims in Fanxian, Shouzhang, and Yuncheng were rescued. The Yellow River Headquarters, in addition to dispatching a large number of vessels and organizing civilian boats for rescue operations, provided immediate relief to disaster victims who were genuinely unable to support themselves and had no relatives or friends to turn to, providing each adult with one catty of mixed grains per day and each child with ten taels. Nearby villages were mobilized to provide the greatest possible assistance and resettlement to the disaster victims. The Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government have also put forward four disaster relief measures: Firstly, each special district and county along the river should immediately organize a disaster relief committee to systematically and planfully resettle the refugees based on the disaster situation and call on the masses to help each other and increase relief efforts. Secondly, organize public and private vessels to help the masses salvage belongings. Thirdly, it is estimated that more than 7,000 hectares of land may emerge above the water after the flood recedes, and wheat seeds must be loaned to help the masses rush to plant wheat. Fourthly, the people's governments of the affected areas should immediately organize and lead the masses in production and self-help to overcome the famine.
    【Xinxiang Dispatch】In this Yellow River disaster, the residents of the riverbed in Pingyuan Province suffered the most. According to preliminary statistics from 64 villages in the Puyang County section alone, five people were drowned, and another eight were swept away on rooftops, their fate unknown. The water has now receded slightly, and the masses have begun to salvage corn, sweet potatoes, and sorghum, and to find property buried in houses. Han Zheyi, Deputy Chairman of the Pingyuan Provincial Government, personally visited the disaster-stricken masses in the riverbed on the 19th of this month. When the boat arrived at Dazhai Village in Puyang, the water level had receded slightly. Deputy Chairman Han walked through the mud and inquired and comforted the people one by one. Disaster victims said that this flood broke through six village protection dams in a row, the water in the back streets was waist-deep, houses collapsed, pots, bowls, clothes were crushed, people stood under the collapsed roofs, extremely dangerous, fortunately, the large boats organized by the government came to rescue, and they were able to escape. Many disaster victims are now living in the homes of relatives and friends, and when the water recedes, they will plant wheat, but they lack wheat seeds. In addition to providing comfort, Deputy Chairman Han stated that the government will do its utmost to provide assistance to the victims, and hoped that the victims could also help themselves, organize, and produce to overcome the famine.
    【Another Dispatch】In order to solve the current difficulty for the masses in planting wheat seeds, the branch of the People's Bank of China has allocated 3,490,000 catties of wheat to various special districts on the 15th of this month, and the special districts are seizing the time to start distributing it. The branch pointed out that this year's wheat seed loans should focus on areas with serious disasters, and other areas should generally not be loaned (except for the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers who have difficulties). It is strictly forbidden to distribute the loans evenly.

　　黄河民埝溃决成灾
  　平原省府紧急救济灾胞
    人民银行分行发放麦种三百余万斤
    【新乡电】平原省黄河沿线民埝溃决后，河床居民受灾严重。政府正采取紧急措施救济灾胞。十五、十六两日，平原省黄河沿线之民埝全部被冲决，寿张与梁山县之严善人（系民埝名）埝亦同时决口，西起东明、长垣东至长清，以及梁山、寿张等县，共淹村庄一千四百多个。受灾人口共约七十余万。为急救灾胞，各地党政部门与河务局石料运输处、航政管理局派出全部船只，各地政府也组织民船抢救。先救人、后运资财。因之范县、寿张、郓城灾民大部被救。黄河总指挥部除调大批船只，并组织民船赴各地抢救，对真正无法生活而又无亲友可投之灾民，予以随时救济。大人每人每日发一斤杂粮，儿童十两。并动员附近各村，予灾民以最大帮助和安置。省委会、省政府特又提出四项救灾办法：一、沿河各专、县立即组织救灾委员会，有组织、有计划地根据灾情安置难民，并号召群众互助互济，以增加救济力量。二、组织公私船只帮助群众打捞东西。三、大水落后，估计可能有七千多顷地高出水面，须贷麦种一部帮助群众抢种小麦。四、各被灾区的人民政府应即组织和领导群众生产自救渡过灾荒。
    【新乡电】此次黄灾，平原省河床居民受害最重。仅据濮阳县段六十四村初步统计，计淹死的五人，另有八人在屋顶上漂走，生死不明。现水已稍落，群众开始打捞玉蜀黍、红薯、高粱，找出砸在屋内财物。平原省政府韩副主席哲一，于本月十九日亲赴河床慰问受灾群众。当船驶至濮阳打寨村时，水势已稍落。韩副主席踏着稀泥，依次亲询慰问。灾民述说这次大水一直冲破六道护庄坝埝，后街的水深至腰，房倒屋塌，锅碗衣物被砸，人站在已塌的屋顶下，危险万分，幸有政府组织的大船来抢救，始得出险。现不少灾民都在亲友家寄居，水落了，就要种麦，但缺少麦种。韩副主席除进行安慰之外，并说明政府对灾胞定尽最大努力予以援助，并希灾胞们亦能自己动手，组织起来，生产渡荒。
    【又电】中国人民银行分行为解决目前群众种麦种籽困难，特于本月十五日拨发各专区麦子三百四十九万斤，各专区正抓紧时机开始发放。分行指出：今年发放麦种贷款，重点应放于灾情严重地区，其他地区一般不贷（有困难之烈军干属例外）严禁平均分散。
