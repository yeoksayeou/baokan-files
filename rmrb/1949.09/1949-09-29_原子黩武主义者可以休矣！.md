Atomic warmongers can take a break!

	On the same day that the imperialist war group headed by the American reactionary Truman and others frantically shouted that "the Soviet Union has already had an atomic bomb explosion," Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky, in his speech to the United Nations General Assembly, suggested to the General Assembly that measures for the unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons and the implementation of full and strict international control brook no further delay. Then, on the 24th, TASS issued a statement, clearly pointing out that the Soviet Union had already discovered the secrets of atomic weapons as early as 1947, and already possessed such weapons, but the Soviet government had always adhered to the position of unconditionally prohibiting the use of atomic weapons, and emphasized the necessity of controlling atomic weapons. This is an extremely heavy blow to the "atomic" warmongers headed by US imperialism, making them tremble and unable to stand!

	Prior to this, US imperialism and its hired lackeys had always been using a different tone to make propaganda about the atomic bomb. They deliberately exaggerated the power of the atomic bomb, and nonsensically claimed that "two atomic bombs forced Japan to surrender." On the one hand, they used this to erase the huge decisive role of the Soviet army's participation in the war against Japan in defeating Japan, and on the other hand, they used it to scare some people in the world who were neurasthenic or had no common sense of modern science. They were initially so complacent, thinking that only they possessed the secret of atomic energy. In fact, atomic energy is the result of the development of modern natural sciences in various countries around the world, and is not a mythical monster that fell from the sky. This is by no means something that anyone or any country can claim as its own unique secret. In October 1947, Molotov said in his speech at the 30th anniversary of the October Revolution in Moscow: "As is well known, among the American expansionists, a new religion is widely popular. Since they have lost confidence in their own internal strength, they place their faith in the secret of the atomic bomb, although this secret has long ceased to be a secret." This was the first time in the world that the bankruptcy of the imperialists' "atomic bomb religion" was announced. At the Third United Nations General Assembly in 1948, Vyshinsky reiterated that the atomic bomb was no longer a secret. However, the delusions of American atomic warmongers did not become any clearer because of this. Since the United Nations General Assembly in January 1946, the Soviet Union has put forward proposals on the atomic bomb issue at successive United Nations General Assemblies, requesting the conclusion of an international convention on the prohibition of atomic weapons, requesting the destruction of all existing atomic bomb stockpiles after the convention comes into effect, and requesting the establishment of an international control agency within the Security Council to supervise the production of atomic energy; however, even after the Soviet Union repeatedly announced that the atomic bomb was no longer a secret, US imperialism mistakenly thought that this was Soviet "bluffing," and has been manipulating its "voting machine" in the United Nations General Assembly, controlling the General Assembly, rejecting the Soviet Union's peace proposals, and repeatedly evading and obstructing the work of the Atomic Energy Commission,妄想着保有在原子能领域中的永久统治权。

	Now US imperialism and its lackeys are panicking because they have discovered that "an atomic bomb explosion has occurred in the Soviet Union." This is very natural, and there will probably be more things that will make them even more panic-stricken!

	However, after their panic, the imperialists seem to be trying to make a desperate struggle. According to a Washington dispatch from the Associated Press on the 24th: "Panicked members of Congress are calling on Atlantic nations to combine their defense efforts more closely, and to concentrate the manufacture of atomic weapons in the United States." According to a Washington dispatch from Reuters on the 24th: "Truman has urged Congress to include in the military appropriations bill the provision to spend × million dollars to purchase 'strategic and urgently needed' materials to build national defense. ... A joint conference of the House and Senate will quickly pass the $20 million foreign aid bill approved by the Senate on Thursday, and possibly also the Marshall Aid appropriation and foreign aid appropriation that were blocked in the joint conference recently." These are the exposure of the US imperialists' conspiracy to carry out a desperate struggle. Obviously, the war-mongers of the United States will "not give up until they reach the Yellow River." They also want to use the so-called "Soviet atomic explosion incident" to "persuade" their "opposition," to frighten and divert the people's attention from their preparations for a new war, to find an excuse to expand military spending, and to find an excuse to further control the North Atlantic countries and support the reactionaries of various countries.

	However, all the attempts of the frightened imperialists are futile. As is well known, the Soviet Union has always been and always will be the defender of world peace; the fact that the Soviet Union possesses atomic weapons does not mean that a new war is likely to occur, but on the contrary, it means that the proposal to prohibit and control atomic weapons is more powerful, and that the strength of the world peace camp is stronger. The essence of American capitalism determines that it does not dare and is unwilling to use atomic energy for peaceful industry, but instead is trying its best to destroy the social productive forces; and once atomic energy is combined with socialism, it will inevitably accelerate the progress of peaceful industrial construction.

	The Chinese people are very excited about the TASS statement, and have infinite admiration for the Soviet government's adherence to the position of prohibiting atomic weapons. We have basically defeated the US imperialists' heinous conspiracy to use China as a base for a new war through the People's Liberation War. We believe even more that the Soviet Union can use the fact that it possesses atomic weapons to shatter the evil new war plan of the US atomic warmongers.

### 原子黩武主义者可以休矣！

　　原子黩武主义者可以休矣！
    当着以美国反动派杜鲁门等为首的帝国主义战争集团惊慌地叫喊“苏联已有原子弹爆炸的事实发生”的同一天，苏外长维辛斯基在联合国大会演说中向联大建议：无条件禁用原子武器并实施充分与严格的国际管制的措施已不容再事拖延；接着，二十四日塔斯社发表声明，明确指出苏联早在一九四七年就已寻找出了原子武器的秘密，而且已经有了这种武器，但苏联政府一直信守着无条件禁止使用原子武器的立场，并着重说明管制原子武器的必要。这对于以美帝国主义为首的“原子”黩武主义者是极沉重的打击，使它们浑身发抖，站立不住！
    在这以前，美帝国主义及其雇佣的喽＠，一直是用另一种口吻作着关于原子弹的宣传，他们故意夸大地吹嘘原子弹的威力，胡说什么“两颗原子弹迫使日本投降”的鬼话，一方面用以抹杀苏军参加对日作战对于战胜日本的巨大决定性作用，一方面用以吓唬世界各国一些神经衰弱或毫无近代科学常识的人。他们最初是那样地沾沾自喜，以为只有他们握有原子能的秘密。其实原子能是近代世界各国自然科学发展的成果，并不是什么神话似地凭空掉下来的怪物，这决不是任何人任何国家所能据以为自己独特的秘藏的。一九四七年十月，莫洛托夫在莫斯科十月革命三十周年纪念会上演说时就说：“如所周知，在美国扩张分子中间，正广泛流行着一种新的宗教，既然对他们内部自己的力量失去了信心，他们就把他们的信仰寄托于原子弹的秘密上，虽然这种秘密早已不成其为秘密了。”这向全世界第一次宣布了帝国主义者的“原子弹宗教”的破产。一九四八年第三届联合国大会上，维辛斯基曾重申原子弹已非秘密。可是美国的原子黩武主义者的迷梦并没有因此清醒一些。从一九四六年一月联合国大会以来，历次联合国大会上苏联都提出关于原子弹问题的建议，要求缔结关于禁止原子武器的国际公约，要求在公约生效后毁灭一切现有的原子弹存货，要求在安理会内设置国际管制机构督察原子能的生产；可是，虽在苏联一再宣布原子弹早非秘密之后，美帝国主义还错以为这是苏联“虚张声势”，在联合国大会上一直操纵着它的“投票机器”，把持大会，拒绝苏联的和平建议，并多方回避、阻挠原子能委员会的工作，妄想着保有在原子能领域中的永久统治权。
    现在美帝国主义及其喽＠们因为发现“已有原子弹爆炸的事在苏联发生”而大惊失措了，这是很当然的，使它们更加惊恐失措的事恐怕还会有的！
    然而，帝国主义于惊恐之余，似乎又正企图作冒险的挣扎。据美联社华盛顿二十四日电称：“惊慌的国会议员们呼吁大西洋国家把他们的防御工作更紧密地结合起来，在美国集中制造原子武器。”又据路透社华盛顿二十四日电称：“杜鲁门已力请国会把花费×千万美元购买‘战略与急需’物资以建设国防的规定列到军费拨款法案中。……参众两院联席会议将从速通过参院在星期四批准的两千万美元武器援外法案，可能还有日前在联席会议中受阻的马歇尔援助拨款和援外拨款。”这些正是美帝国主义者企图进行冒险挣扎的阴谋的暴露。显然美国的战争贩子们是“不到黄河心不甘”的，它们还想借所谓“苏联原子爆炸事件”来“说服”其“反对派”，恐吓并转移人民对他们准备新战争的注意力，为扩充军费寻找借口，为进一步控制北大西洋各国及支持各国反动派寻找借口。
    可是，惊魂不定的帝国主义者之一切企图都是徒然的。众所周知，苏联一贯是而且永远是世界和平的保卫者；苏联拥有了原子武器，这一事实决不是表示着新战争的可能发生，而是完全相反，表示着禁用与管制原子武器的建议更为有力，表示着世界和平阵营的力量更为强大。美国资本主义的本质决定了它不敢也不肯使用原子能于和平工业，反而竭力在破坏着社会的生产力；而原子能一经和社会主义相结合，将必然会使和平的工业建设加速进展。
    中国人民对于塔斯社的声明感到非常兴奋，对于苏联政府信守禁用原子武器的立场更有无限钦敬，我们已以人民解放战争基本上打败了美帝国主义以中国为新战争基地的万恶阴谋，我们更相信苏联能以握有原子武器这一事实击碎美帝原子黩武主义者的罪恶的新战争计划。
