To the Editor:

Due to insufficient attention to workers' medical care and hygiene, and a careless and perfunctory attitude toward prescriptions, a very unfortunate incident occurred in the Second Clothing Factory. The course of events is as follows:

Wang Haichang, a member of the Communist Youth League and a sewing worker at the Second Clothing Factory, was on guard duty at the factory on the night of August 31st. The next day, he caught a cold while rushing to move cotton bales that had been rained on. In the morning, he went to the clinic for medicine. Huang, the medical assistant at the clinic, gave him 20 cc of a dark purple liquid. Wang Haichang smelled a strange odor and asked what the medicine was. Huang, the medical assistant, said, "It will be good after you take it." Wang Haichang drank it all in one gulp. Immediately after drinking it, he felt very uncomfortable, as if there was a fire burning in his throat and stomach, and then he vomited. He was sent to the main factory for two injections, and then to the Army Hospital. After testing, it was found that he had drunk iodine.

A similar and even more serious incident occurred in the Duanfu Sewing Department of the Clothing Factory. In late July, more than one hundred workers experienced widespread vomiting, high fevers, delirious speech, red and swollen eyes, and festering injection sites on the night after receiving cholera vaccinations from Doctor Kang of the sewing department. The factory spent 5,000 catties of millet on emergency treatment and delayed the production of 5,000 sets of military uniforms. An investigation revealed that the cholera vaccine had been stored for too long and had partially settled. The clinic of the sewing department not only failed to inspect it in advance, but also, out of convenience, poured the vaccine into unwashed old bottles that had contained other drugs, resulting in a chemical reaction.

We believe that such careless, irresponsible, and neglectful behavior toward workers' health is fundamentally due to a lack of a responsible attitude toward the people. The people will never allow such a bad style to continue. We ask the editor to publish this letter to encourage everyone to pay attention to this issue, and we hope that the leadership of the Clothing Factory will quickly correct it.

### 被服厂某些医务人员　漠视工人健康  竟给患感冒病人喝碘酒注射坏疫苗使百人高烧

　　被服厂某些医务人员
　  漠视工人健康
    竟给患感冒病人喝碘酒注射坏疫苗使百人高烧编辑同志：
    因为对工人的医药卫生不够重视，处方上的粗枝大叶，胡乱了事，被服第二厂发生了一件非常不幸的事。事情的经过是这样的：
    被服第二厂缝纫工青年团员王海常，在八月三十一日夜间担任工厂警卫工作，第二天因为抢搬将被雨淋的棉花包，受了凉。上午去医务室要药吃，医务室黄医助给他二十ＣＣ浓紫的药水，王海常闻着有怪味，问他是什么药，黄医助说：“吃了就好。”王海常就一口气喝下去了。吃后马上就觉得非常难受，喉咙、胃部好象有火在烧，随即呕吐。送到总厂去打了二针后，又送到陆军医院，经化验的结果，喝的竟是碘酒。
    类似并且更加严重的事，发生在被服厂段府缝纫部。七月下旬，一百多位工人在接受该缝纫部康医生的霍乱预防注射后的当晚，普遍发生大呕吐，发高热说呓语，眼睛红肿，着针处溃烂等现象。工厂因紧急救治而耗费五千斤小米，耽搁生产五千套军装。事后调查，因为霍乱菌疫苗积存太久，已起部分沉淀作用，该缝纫部医务室不仅没预先检查，反而因为贪图方便，将疫苗倒置未经洗涤的曾装其他药物的旧瓶中，致起了化学作用。
    象这种粗枝大叶，漠视工人健康，糊涂塞责的事，我们认为基本上就是缺乏对人民负责的观点。这种坏作风，人民决不容许它继续存在，请编辑同志把这信发表，促起大家重视，并希望被服厂领导方面速予纠正。
