Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 7th. "Gansu Daily" was launched in Lanzhou on September 1st, and published an editorial celebrating the liberation of Lanzhou. The editorial pointed out that Lanzhou is the political, economic, and cultural center of Gansu, as well as a strategically important military town and transportation hub in the Northwest. The liberation of Lanzhou not only marks the rapid liberation of the entire Gansu province but also has a very significant impact on the military situation in the Northwest. First, it cut off the connection between the reactionary troops in the Northwest, creating more favorable conditions for annihilating the enemy. Second, the reactionary派 [faction] lost its ruling center in the Northwest, further increasing the internal wavering, confusion, and disintegration of the enemy. Third, by annihilating over 20,000 enemy troops, it basically eliminated the main force of the Qing Ma bandit army, which can significantly shorten the time to liberate the entire Northwest. However, the editorial pointed out that the remaining military forces of the reactionary派 [faction] have not yet been completely eliminated, and the great task of liberating all of Gansu and the entire Northwest is still before us. The people of all ethnic groups in Gansu must unite, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, to eliminate the reactionary local armed forces and establish people's armed forces; complete the advance requisition of grain and grass to vigorously support the advancing army; complete the takeover work of Lanzhou city and the vast urban and rural areas, and rapidly restore urban and rural industrial and agricultural production. The editorial finally emphasized that Gansu is a newly liberated area and a multi-ethnic region. Widely publicizing policies, educating and organizing the masses, and continuously enhancing the unity of people of all ethnic groups are the prerequisites for us to do all our work well.

　　“甘肃日报”在兰创刊
  　发表社论庆祝兰州解放
    号召各民族人民团结起来完成解放全甘肃全西北任务
    【新华社兰州七日电】“甘肃日报”于九月一日在兰州创刊，并发表社论庆祝兰州解放。社论指出兰州是甘肃的政治、经济、文化中心，又是西北军事重镇和交通枢纽，兰州的解放，不仅标志着甘肃全省迅速解放，而且对西北战局有极重大的影响。首先是割断了西北反动军队的联系，造成歼灭敌人的更有利的条件；其次是反动派在西北失去了统治中心，更加增长了敌人内部的动摇混乱与分崩离析；第三是歼敌两万数千人，基本上消灭了青马匪军主力，这就可相当地缩短解放全西北的时间。但社论指出：目前反动派的残余军事力量还没有消灭干净，解放全甘肃和全西北的伟大任务还摆在我们面前，全甘肃各民族人民必须团结起来，在共产党和人民政府领导下，肃清反动地方武装，建立人民武装；完成预借粮草，大力支援大军前进；完成兰州市与广大城乡的接管工作，迅速恢复城乡工农业生产。社论最后并着重指出：甘肃是刚解放的新区，又是一个多民族的地区，广泛宣传政策，教育和组织群众，并不断增进各民族人民的团结，是我们做好一切工作的前提条件。
