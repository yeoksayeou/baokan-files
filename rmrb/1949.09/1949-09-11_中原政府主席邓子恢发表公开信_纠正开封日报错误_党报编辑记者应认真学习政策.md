[Henan News] The Kaifeng Daily of Henan Province published a local news item on May 19th titled "Be Vigilant Against Speculators' Illegal Profiteering," which committed a serious policy error. Comrade Deng Zihui, Chairman of the Central Plains People's Government, issued an open letter instructing its correction. The news item stated that Ren Xinyi, a small vendor in Guanfang Town, District Five, Kaifeng, and others, seeing that the government was organizing cart drivers to transport and sell salt without interest-bearing loans, enlisted three small merchants and five cart drivers from the neighborhood. Under the introduction of the town cadres, they borrowed 5,000 catties of salt from the Kaifeng Trading Company, but they did not transport it themselves, instead hiring cars and horse carts for transportation. Another case involved merchant Meng Guangwen, who, seeing that the government was restoring the peanut oil pressing industry and raising the purchase price of peanut oil, organized an oil pressing group with others. Through the introduction of the District Five Cooperative, they signed a contract with the Trading Company to exchange 2.5 catties of peanuts for 1 catty of peanut oil, totaling 1,000 catties of peanut oil. After Meng Guangwen received over 100,000 yuan in Central Bank notes, he pressed only a small amount of oil himself, and purchased the rest from farmers. The news item accused Ren Xinyi and Meng Guangwen of "speculation and profiteering, and improper behavior of illegal profiteering." The editor's note further stated that this "helped certain speculative merchants to engage in speculation and disrupt the market." Comrade Deng Zihui pointed out that this news and the editor's note clearly distorted the Party and the People's Government's policies on industry and commerce. Comrade Deng Zihui believed that Ren Xinyi's act of borrowing salt and hiring others for transportation "cannot be condemned as illegal profiteering, nor can it be called speculation, and therefore cannot be regarded as improper behavior." He stated that it was borrowed from the Trading Company through an introduction, not obtained through fraud. The government also has no laws stipulating that merchants cannot use cars and horse carts to transport goods, and only allow cart drivers to transport them. If the Trading Company aims to help cart drivers make a living, and Ren Xinyi violates the regulations, the Trading Company can recover the salt loan, but cannot arbitrarily accuse people of illegal profiteering and disrupting the market, and cannot vaguely call it "improper behavior." Because Ren Xinyi and others did not disrupt the market, but adjusted the market, there was no "illegal" profiteering, but "legal profit," not "improper behavior," but "proper behavior" allowed by the government. Similarly, Comrade Deng Zihui believed that the merchant Meng Guangwen's purchase of peanut oil to hand over to the Trading Company, while pressing very little himself, was also a legitimate commercial activity in line with the interests of the people; it cannot be said to be "speculation," "disrupting the market," or "playing a destructive role." He said that the People's Government has no laws stipulating that merchants cannot purchase peanut oil to hand over to the Trading Company, but only allow themselves to press it. The oil purchased from farmers is also produced by oil pressing workers, which still conforms to the government's original intention of restoring the oil pressing industry. Why only allow Kaifeng workers to produce, but not allow rural farmers to produce? In this regard, Comrade Deng Zihui pointed out that "our administrative cadres and cooperative comrades have a very superficial and vague understanding of our Party's policy of developing industry and commerce and the People's Government's decree of protecting the freedom of industry and commerce. They do not understand that the New Democratic economy should not only have the development of industry and agricultural production, but also the circulation of commerce," especially underestimating the important role of commerce in Henan in activating rural experience, improving rural productivity and purchasing power, and restoring and developing industry. "These comrades do not understand that private capital engaging in industry and commerce is not for anything else but for profit, for getting rich. When they get rich, industry and commerce will also develop." Comrade Deng Zihui said that freedom of business, freedom of employment, and freedom of borrowing are economic laws that should be retained in a New Democratic society, and we should not shake or destroy them. The open letter concluded: The Kaifeng Daily is an important guiding tool of the Party. Every day a newspaper is published, how many people read it, how many people care about it. If a news item is wrong, the editor's note is wrong, "the impact will cause how many masses to have doubts and panic. It will also cause how many cadres to have a vague understanding!" Comrade Deng Zihui said that the origin of this error is that the editors and reporters of the Kaifeng Daily still lack research on the Party's policies and government decrees, and lack a serious and responsible spirit towards the Party and the people's revolutionary cause, and he hopes to conduct a review.

　　中原政府主席邓子恢发表公开信
　  纠正开封日报错误
    党报编辑记者应认真学习政策
    【河南讯】河南省开封日报地方版，于五月十九日刊登“警惕投机商贩非法渔利”的新闻，犯严重政策错误，中原人民政府主席邓子恢同志发表公开信指示纠正。该新闻中说，开封五区官坊镇小贩任新义等，见政府组织架车工人无利贷盐运销，即拉拢街邻三个小商人及五个架车工人，假运输为名，经该镇干部介绍，从开封贸易公司贷盐五千斤，但自己却不运输，另雇汽车马车代运。另一为商人孟广文，见政府恢复花生榨油业，提价收购花生油，即与别人组织一榨油组织，经五区合作社介绍，以二斤半花生米换一斤花生油比率，与贸易公司订立一千斤花生油合同，孟广文领回中钞十余万元后，自己榨油少许，其余则从农民手中收购。该新闻指责任新义、孟广文此举为“投机捣鬼，非法渔利的不正当行为”。编者按语中更说这是“助长了某些投机商人进行投机取巧、捣乱市场的破坏作用”等。邓子恢同志指出这篇新闻及编者按语，显然曲解了党与人民政府的工商业政策，邓子恢同志认为任新义贷盐不从事运输而另雇他人，“不能骂为非法渔利，也不能称为投机捣鬼，因此更不能视为不正当行为。”他说是经这过介绍由贸易公司贷给的，不是诈欺取财。政府也没有任何法律规定商人不能用汽车马车转运商品，而只许架车工人运输。如贸易公司旨在帮助架车工人谋生活，而任新义违反了规定，贸易公司尽可收回盐贷，却不能随便加人以非法渔利捣乱市场的罪名，不能含糊其词说是“不正当行为”。因为任新义等并没有捣乱市场，而正是调剂了市场，没有“非法”渔利，而正是“合法营利”，并非“不正当行为”，而正是政府所允许的“正当行为”。同样，邓子恢同志认为商人孟广文收购花生油交与贸易公司，而自己榨油很少，也是符合人民利益的正当商业行为；不能说是“投机取巧”“捣乱市场”“起破坏作用”。他说人民政府没有法律规定商人不能收购花生油交贸易公司，而只许自己来榨。从农民中购来的油也是经过榨油工人生产的，仍符合于政府恢复榨油业的本意，为什么只准开封工人生产，而不准乡下农民生产，于此，邓子恢同志指出“我们行政干部与合作社同志对我党发展工商业政策与人民政府保护工商业自由的法令是认识得很肤浅很模糊的。他们不懂得新民主主义经济，不仅要有工业与农业生产的发展，而且要有商业的流通”，特别是轻视了在目前的河南商业对活跃农村经验，提高农村生产力与购买力，恢复与发展工业所起的重大作用。“这些同志更不懂得私人资本经营工商业，不是为了别的而是为了图利，为了发财致富。他们发了财，工商业也就发展起来了”。邓子恢同志说营业自由、雇佣自由与借贷自由，是新民主主义社会所应保留的经济法则，我们不应去动摇它破坏它。公开信在最后写道：开封日报是党的重要指导工具，每天刊出一张报纸，多少人阅读，多少人关心，一个新闻发错了，按语说错了，“其影响所及，将使多少群众发生怀疑恐慌。又将使多少干部引起认识模糊！”邓子恢同志说这错误的由来，是开封日报编辑和记者同志对党的政策与政府法令还缺少研究，缺乏对党对人民革命事业认真负责的精神，希望加以检讨。
