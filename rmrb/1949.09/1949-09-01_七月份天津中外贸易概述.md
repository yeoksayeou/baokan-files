Overview of Tianjin's Foreign Trade in July
    Ya Jun

According to the statistics of goods released after tax payment by Tianjin Customs, the total value of foreign trade in Tianjin in July was RMB 2,331,542,794 for imports and RMB 5,968,293,633 for exports. In terms of RMB, exports increased by more than 44% compared to the previous month, and imports increased by about 100%. However, price fluctuations were quite drastic this month. If the total value of imports and exports is converted based on the average market exchange rate of the US dollar for the month, the export value for this month is over 2.7 million US dollars, a decrease of nearly 24% compared to the previous month, while imports increased by more than 11%.

Regarding exports, since the customs implemented the exemption of export tax on June 28, the export cost can be reduced by about 10%. At the same time, the opening of traffic between Ping (Beiping/Beijing) and Shanghai allows northern goods to be transported to the south, which is a trend of growth. However, it was sluggish in the first half of the month due to the impact of shipping congestion. It was not until the arrival of ships such as Jiesheng, Hubei, and Sharish in the second half of the month that shipping became smooth for a time, and exports subsequently turned active. Among the export goods this month, dried egg products ranked first, with 5,227 metric tons exported, worth RMB 1,317,110,800, accounting for 22% of the total value (this product was not exported in the same month of the previous year, but in July 1936, it was the month with the most egg product exports, totaling 12,790 metric tons). As for fresh eggs, a total of 10,337,000 were exported this month, accounting for 2.28% of the total value, which is 1,665,000 more than in the same month of 1936. The second largest export this month was peanut oil, with 9,950 metric tons exported, worth RMB 572,343,051, accounting for 9.6% of the total value, setting a record high since liberation. This is an increase of 4,460 metric tons compared to the previous month, which is a phenomenon not seen in previous years. The third largest export was bristles, with 50,921 kilograms exported this month, worth RMB 446,279,723, accounting for 7.48% of the total value, slightly less than 10,000 kilograms compared to the previous month; however, it is still one to two times less than the previous year and 1936. The fourth largest export was woolen carpets, with 1,529 metric tons exported this month, accounting for about 6% of the total value. Although slightly lower than the previous month, it is still higher than the export volume in any month of the previous year and 1936. Next was peanuts, with 10,160 metric tons exported, a slight increase of 653 metric tons compared to the previous month. This month, another 1,060 metric tons of Lu salt were exported to Japan, bringing the total export volume to 1,669 metric tons. Soybean cake exports greatly increased this month, with 66,308 metric tons, more than two and a half times that of the previous month. The export that decreased the most compared to the previous month was sheep wool, with only 122,551 kilograms exported this month, almost a quarter less. By country of export, Hong Kong ranked first in total export value this month, accounting for 47.28%. Secondly, the United States accounted for 28.22%, the United Kingdom accounted for 17.75%, and Japan accounted for 4.37%. In terms of operators, state-owned enterprises accounted for 35.50%, private enterprises accounted for 47.33%, and foreign merchants accounted for 17.17%.

On the import side, due to the obstruction of shipping in Shanghai, the source of foreign goods was not smooth, resulting in prices gradually increasing. After the direct traffic between Ping (Beiping/Beijing) and Shanghai opened, Shanghai merchants came to Tianjin to purchase goods, which affected the price of foreign goods in Tianjin to rise accordingly. At the same time, the poor shipping in Tianjin in the first half of the month further stimulated the rise in the price of foreign goods. Merchants reported and picked up more goods in order to supply market sales, which may be the main reason for the increase in imports this month. Among the imported foreign goods this month, cigarette paper ranked first, with 222,209 kilograms imported, worth RMB 290,437,313, accounting for 12.46% of the total value, a sudden increase of more than seven times compared to the previous month. There were no imports last year, and the import volume in 1936 was only worth 14,943 yuan in fake gold units. The second largest import was ordinary printing paper and newsprint, with 14,495 metric tons imported, worth RMB 284,785,230, accounting for 12.21% of the total value, a slight increase of 11 metric tons compared to the previous month. The third largest import was unlisted drugs, worth RMB 148,169,003, accounting for 6.35% of the total value, more than double that of the previous month. But in the previous year, only 4.336 kilograms were imported. The fourth largest import was aniline dyes, with a total of 431 metric tons imported, accounting for 6.15% of the total value, a large increase compared to May and June. Last year there were only 256 metric tons. Rubber imports this month decreased slightly compared to the previous month, with a total of 2,754 metric tons, worth RMB 96,145,519, accounting for 4.12% of the total value. However, this is more than the same month last year and 1936. No new jute bags were imported this month, only 1,934 metric tons of old jute bags were imported, accounting for 3.63% of the total value. It is said that Indian jute bags have signed an agreement with Belgium to exchange steel, so our country's imports may be affected by this. By country of import, the United States accounted for 42.06%, the United Kingdom accounted for 16.43%, France accounted for 7.47% (mostly cigarette paper), Sweden accounted for 6.90%, and Norway accounted for 4.22% (these two countries are the main source countries for roll newsprint). In terms of operators, state-owned enterprises accounted for 31.11%, private enterprises accounted for 51.26%, and foreign merchants accounted for 17.63%.

Speaking of maritime trade between neighboring regions, the total import value this month was RMB 436,408,255, a sudden increase of more than seven times compared to the previous month; the total export value was RMB 109,120,832, a slight decrease of more than 43% compared to the previous month. The main imports were mineral oil from Dalian and Qingdao, cotton cloth from Qingdao and Yantai, chemical products from Qingdao and Andong, and millet from Yingkou, etc. The exports included soybeans transported to Qingdao, soybean cake, alkali, and mineral oil transported to Qingdao, Longkou, Yantai, and other places. By port of import, Qingdao accounted for 44.07%, Dalian accounted for 38.12%, Andong accounted for 6.60%, and Yingkou accounted for 4.58%. By port of destination, Qingdao accounted for 50.45%, Longkou accounted for 23.78%, Yantai accounted for 11.04%, and Shanghai accounted for 8.35%.

　　七月份天津中外贸易概述
    雅君
    依照津海关已完税放行的货物统计，本市七月份的对外贸易额进口总值为人民币二、三三一、五四二、七九四元，出口总值为人民币五、九六八、二九三、六三三元，若以人民币来看，则出口较上月增加了百分之四四强，进口增加了约一倍。但本月物价波动颇烈，若将出进口总值按当月之平均市价美汇加以折算，则本月出口值为二百七十余万美元，较上月且减少了百分之二十四弱，进口则增加了百分之十一强。
    出口方面自六月二十八日海关实行免征出口税后，出口成本可减低约百分之十左右。同时平沪通车，北货可以南运，本是增长的趋势，惟因上半月受航运阻塞的影响，曾见疲滞。直到下半月捷盛、湖北、夏利士等轮相继来津，航运一时通畅，出口随之才转趋活泼。本月出口货物中以干蛋品占第一位，计出口五、二二七公担，值人民币一、三一七、一一○、八○○元，占总值百分之二二（前年同月此品并无出口，但在一九三六年七月，是蛋品出口最多的一个月，共计一二、七九○公担）。至鲜蛋本月共输出了一○、三三七、○○○个，价值占总值的百分之二·二八，比一九三六年同月却多了一、六六五、○○○个。本月出口的第二位是花生油，计输出九、九五○公担，值人民币五七二、三四三、○五一元，占总值的百分之九·六，创解放以来之最高纪录，比上月增加了四、四六○公担，这是往年所没有的现象。第三位是猪鬃，本月输出五○、九二一公斤，值人民币四四六、二七九、七二三元，占总值百分之七·四八，比上月稍逊一万多公斤；但较前年和一九三六年还差一倍到两倍。第四位是毛地毯，本月输出一、五二九公担，价值约占总值的百分之六，虽较上月稍为减退，但比前年和一九三六年任何一个月的输出量仍高。以次为花生仁，计出口一○、一六○公担，较上月微增六五三公担。本月芦盐又有一、○六○公吨输往日本，连前共已输出了一、六六九公吨。豆饼输出本月大为增进，计六六、三○八公担，比上月增加两倍半有奇。本月出口比较上月减退最多的是绵羊毛，本月只输出了一二二、五五一公斤，几乎减少至四分之一。以出口的国别来分别比较，则本月出口总值以香港居首，占４７．２８％。其次，美国占２８．２２％，英国占１７．７５％，日本占４．３７％。若以经营者来比较，则公营的占３５．５０％，私营的占４７．３３％，而洋商则占１７．１７％。
    进口方面因上海海运受阻，洋货来源欠畅，致价格步步趋高。平沪直达通车后，沪商纷纷来津采购，遂影响津市洋货价格随之趋升。同时又以上半月本市航运欠通，更刺激洋货价目上涨。商人为了供应市场销售，多报关提货，这可能是本月进口增加的大原因。本月进口洋货中，以卷烟纸占首位，计输入二二二、二○九公斤，值人民币二九○、四三七、三一三元，占总值的百分之一二·四六，较上月突增七倍多。去年并无进口，一九三六年的输入量只值伪金单位一四、九四三元。第二位是普通印书纸和印报纸，计进口一四、四九五公担，值人民币二八四、七八五、二三○元，占总值百分之一二·二一，比上月微增一一公担。第三位为未列名药品，值人民币一四八、一六九、○○三元，占总值百分之六·三五，比上月增加了一倍有奇。但在前年只进口了四·三三六公斤而已。第四位为安尼林染料，共进口四三一公担，占总值的百分之六·一五，比五、六两月份都大见增加。去年只有二五六公担。本月橡胶的进口较上月稍见减少，共二、七五四公担，值人民币九六、一四五、五一九元，占总值的百分之四、一二。但较去年和一九三六年同月还多。本月新麻袋没有进口，只旧麻袋输入一、九三四公担，占总值的百分之三、六三。据说印度的麻袋曾和比国订约交换钢铁，因之我国进口，可能受到这种影响。以进口的国别来比较，则美国占４２．０６％，英国占１６．４３％，法国占７．４７％（多数是纸烟纸），瑞典占６．９０％，脑威占４．２２％（这两国是卷筒报纸的主要来源国），以经营者而论，则公营占３１．１１％，私营占５１．２６％，洋商占１７．６３％。
    再谈到友邻区间的海上贸易，本月份的进口总值为人民币四三六、四○八、二五五元，较上月骤增了七倍多；出口总值为人民币一○九、一二○、八三二元，较上月则稍减百分之四三强。主要进口货有自大连和青岛运来的矿物油，青岛和烟台来的棉布，青岛和安东的化学产品，营口来的小米等，出口货则有运往青岛之黄豆，运往青岛、龙口、烟台等地之豆饼、碱及矿物油等。以进口口岸来比较，青岛来的占４４．０７％，大连占３８．１２％，安东占６．６０％，营口占４．５８％。若以运往口岸作比较，则青岛占５０．４５％，龙口占２３．７８％，烟台占１１．０４％，上海占８．３５％。
