　　Shanghai Cotton Mills Jointly Purchase Cotton
　　Funds Temporarily Set at 20 Billion
　　Self-Sufficiency Expected After New Cotton Enters the Market
    [Shanghai News] After the establishment of the Joint Cotton Purchasing Committee of public and private cotton mills (eight representatives from public cotton mills and seven from private cotton mills), in order to crush the enemy's blockade, active cotton purchasing work is underway. The funds are temporarily set at 20 billion, of which the China National Cotton Yarn & Cloth Corporation will bear 20%, and the public and private cotton mills will bear 80%, to be shared by each mill. The sharing standard is based on the number of spindles currently in operation (900,000 spindles for public mills and 1,100,000 spindles for private mills), with each 10,000 spindles contributing 34.8 million. Of the aforementioned 20 billion funds, 10 billion will be used to acquire existing cotton stocks in various regions, and the other 10 billion will be used to acquire new cotton after it enters the market. It is estimated that 10 billion funds can acquire more than 100,000 dan of raw cotton.
    According to estimates from textile industry人士: this year's new cotton on the market, in addition to civilian use, can be transported to Shanghai. From North China and Northwest China, the cotton supply can reach 3.2 million dan, and from Central China, it can reach 1.8 million dan, for a total of 4.8 million dan. Most of this cotton will be used in Shanghai. According to the current operating conditions of Shanghai cotton mills, the monthly demand for raw cotton is 300,000 dan. Therefore, after the new cotton enters the market, public and private textile industries will not depend on foreign cotton and can maintain normal production.

　　沪纱厂联合购棉
　  资金暂定二百亿
　  估计新花登场后即可自给
    【上海讯】公私营纱厂国棉联购委员会（公营纱厂八人，私营纱厂七人）成立后，为了粉碎敌人封锁，积极进行购棉工作，资金暂定二百亿，其中花纱布公司负担百分之二十，公私营纱厂负担百分之八十，由各厂分担。分担标准以现开纱锭数为原则（公营厂九十万锭，私营厂一百十万锭），每万锭出资三千四百八十万。上述二百亿资金，将以一百亿先行收购各地存棉，另一百亿则俟新棉登场后收购新棉。估计一百亿资金，可收购原棉十余万担。
    据纺织界人士估计：本年度新棉登场，除了民间自用之外，可运沪供应者华北、西北棉花可达三百二十万担，华中方面可达一百八十万担，总共四百八十万担。此项棉花，大部分将归上海方面应用。依目前上海纱厂开工情况，每月需原棉三十万担，因此新花登场后，公私纺织业不依赖外棉，亦可照常维持生产。
