Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 13th: The latest issue of "Struggle for Victory," the organ of Yugoslav exiles on the Polish border published here, contains a series of essays on the political and economic situation in Yugoslavia and the recent Soviet note to Yugoslavia. The essay entitled "From the Formation of a New Communist Party to the Rapid Victory of Overthrowing the Tito Clique" states: The process of establishing a new Yugoslav Marxist Communist Party, which is being born in the flames of the anti-Tito clique struggle, is intensifying. This struggle has reached a new stage, the stage of directly organizing and uniting the masses of the people to overthrow the imperialist lackeys headed by Tito, Rankovic, Kardelj, and Djilas. The victory in the struggle to organize such a party depends on the efforts of all working people in Yugoslavia to mobilize for the anti-Tito clique struggle, on the development of the revolutionary movement, and on the firm political struggle to overthrow the anti-communist, anti-people, fascist, and terrorist regime of this clique.
