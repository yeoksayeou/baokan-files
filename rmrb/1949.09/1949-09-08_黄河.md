　　The Yellow River
    Chairman of the North China Water Conservancy Committee, Xing Zhaotang
    Since historical times, the Yellow River has been said to be an uncontrollable torrent. Since the Song Dynasty, the Yellow River has had no fixed lower course. Recorded major course changes number six, and minor ones seven. The loss of life and property of the people has been incalculable. It is no accident that the people of the Central Plains call the Yellow River "Yellow Peril." "The Yellow River's waters come from the sky" precisely describes the turbulent state of the Yellow River suddenly pouring into the Central Plains from the Northwest Plateau. Today, if we want to conquer the Yellow River's floods, we must conduct a comprehensive study from its source to its mouth to find the root cause and devise solutions. Considering just the section from Maojin Ferry to the sea, the situation is dangerous enough. The section from Maojin Ferry downwards, especially from the Zhengzhou Iron Bridge to Lanfeng, is characterized by wide embankments, an unfixed riverbed, slow flow, and rapid siltation. Consequently, the embankments have had to be raised year by year along with the rising riverbed. The city of Kaifeng is now more than two zhang (approximately 6.6 meters) lower than the bottom of the Yellow River. If there is a rat hole or badger burrow leaking water in the embankments, there is a risk of breaching and changing course with the slightest carelessness. This is the fundamental reason why the Central Plains region cannot control the Yellow River. The section from Lanfeng to Jinan is characterized by narrow embankments and small capacity. If the Yellow River's flow reaches 20,000 cubic meters per second, there is a risk of overflowing. The section entering the sea is characterized by dispersed rivers, even slower flow, and even faster siltation, and a landscape of sand without a single stone, and without even a piece of good soil. Building solid embankments to "constrict the water to attack the sand" and ensure smooth discharge is still very difficult under the current conditions. Therefore, river management projects in the plains are not a one-time solution, but rather a yearly contest with the Yellow River, constantly fighting against the Yellow River waters. Under such circumstances, it is indeed a significant achievement to have prevented the Yellow River from breaching for the past two years.
    During this year's flood season, the Yellow River's maximum flow was 17,000 cubic meters per second. However, our engineering standards this year, due to limited financial resources, are only one meter higher than the 16,500 cubic meters per second flow. Therefore, the situation during this year's flood season was extremely critical. After the danger occurred at Guantai, the main cadres of the Yellow River Commission, along with all engineering personnel and the masses in that section, mobilized fully and continuously fought for twenty-five days and nights, finally making the surging Yellow River waves submit to the pressure of the broad masses and obediently flow eastward.
    For the past two years, under the glorious banner of Mao Zedong and the correct leadership of the People's Government, the people of the Central Plains have overcome unparalleled difficulties, defeated the Chiang bandits who were accustomed to digging dikes and releasing water, and conquered the uncontrollable Yellow River. This not only demonstrates the great power of the Chinese people to overcome everything, but also soundly struck a blow to the despicable conspiracies of reactionary "experts" at home and abroad who妄想 [wangxiang] to inundate the liberated areas. In the sharp struggle to return the Yellow River to its former course, it has been proven that the airplanes and artillery of American imperialism cannot flatten our Yellow River embankments or scatter our thousands upon thousands of workers restoring the dikes and fighting the flood. The Kuomintang bandit gang's secret agents and traitors also cannot burn all our river management straw materials, steal all our river management equipment, or sabotage our river management projects. Furthermore, it proves that our river management projects over the past two years can withstand the impact of a 17,000 cubic meters per second flood.
    The achievements of the past two years are great, but there are also many shortcomings. As long as we accept experience, are not arrogant or complacent, are not careless, learn humbly, respect technology, organize the masses, rely on the masses, and combine technology with the strength of the masses, and always strive tirelessly, then we have every reason to believe that we will certainly be able to transform the water hazards that are harmful to the national economy and the people's livelihood into water conservancy that is beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood.

　　黄河
    华北水利委员会主任委员  邢肇棠
    黄河从有史以来，据说是无法控制的一道洪流，宋朝以后，黄河就没有下游，有记载的改道是大徙六次，小徙七次，人民生命财产的损失是不可以数计的，中原人民称黄水为“黄祸”当不是偶然的了。“黄河之水天上来”正是形容黄河从西北高原突然泻入中原平原的激湍姿态。今天我们要征服黄河水患，必须从发源到入海作一全盘研究，才能找出根由，想出办法。兹就茅津渡到入海一段而言，其形势就足够危险了。由茅津渡以下特别是由郑州铁桥到兰封的一段，它的特点是堤距宽，河身不固定，流速缓，淤淀快，因而两堤也就不得不随着河底的逐年上长而逐年增高，现在的开封城还比黄河底低二丈有余，假如两堤有一个鼠穴獾洞漏水，一不小心，它就有决口改道的可能，这是中原地区对黄河无法控制的基本原因。由兰封到济南一段，它的特点是堤距窄，容量小，假如黄河流量达到二万秒立方公尺时，它就有漫溢危险。入海一段，则是河流分散，流速更缓，淤淀更快，且一片砂土，不仅没有一方石头，而且找不到一块好土；要筑成坚固堤岸，使其“束水攻沙”，宣泄通畅，在目前的条件下还是有很大困难的。因此，平原一带的治河工程，不是一劳永逸，而是年年与黄河争高低，时时与黄水作斗争。在这样的情况下，两年来能使黄河不决口，确是一件非同小可的大事情。
    今年伏汛期间，黄河最大流量为一万七千秒立方公尺，然我们今年的工程标准，却因财力所限，仅高出一万六千五百秒立方公尺流量的一公尺，因此，今年伏汛期间，黄河险象是十分危急。贯台发生危险后，黄委会主要干部与该段所有工程人员及群众，全体动员，连续抢护了二十五个昼夜，终使奔腾汹涌的黄河浪潮，屈服在广大群众的压力之下，驯服地向东流去了。
    两年来，我中原人民在光辉的毛泽东旗帜下，人民政府的正确领导下，克服了无比困难，击溃了惯于掘堤放水的蒋匪，战胜了无法控制的黄河。这不仅表现了中国人民能够战胜一切的伟大力量，而且痛痛快快地打击了妄想淹没解放区的中外反动“专家”们的卑鄙阴谋。在黄河归故的尖锐斗争中，证明了美帝国主义的飞机大炮不能炸平我们的黄河堤岸，轰散我们成千成万的复堤抢险员工。蒋家匪帮的特务奸细，也不能烧尽我们的治河秸料，偷尽我们的治河器材，破坏我们的治河工程。更证明我们两年来的治河工程是经得起一万七千秒立方公尺洪流的激荡。
    两年来的成绩是大的，但缺点亦复不少，只要我们接受经验，不骄不傲，不麻痹大意，虚心学习，尊重技术，组织群众，依靠群众，使技术与群众力量结合在一起，始终不倦地奋斗，则我们就有充分理由，相信一定能够把有害于国计民生的水患，改变成为有益于国计民生的水利。
