Fifteen foreign delegations from countries including the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Bulgaria, France, and Republican Spain also participated. Polish Prime Minister Cyrankiewicz delivered the opening speech, and when he stated that it was only thanks to the Soviet Union that the Nazi German war machine could be defeated, the entire audience stood up and shouted "Long Live Stalin."

The representatives expressed their commitment to remaining faithful to this oath. The Soviet delegation was represented by Holodkov, who gave a congratulatory speech to the Congress. The German delegation was addressed by the outstanding anti-fascist Pieck, who, after exposing the anti-people policies of the West German imperialists that run counter to the interests of peace, emphasized that the forces in Germany striving for peace, democracy, and unity are fighting against the policies of imperialism and demanding the conclusion of a peace treaty and the withdrawal of occupying forces. Representatives from France and Czechoslovakia, the Polish armed forces, and other representatives also gave congratulatory speeches to the Congress.
