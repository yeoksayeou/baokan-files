　　After Hard Work and Reconstruction by Workers
　　Beiyang Paper Mill Starts Production
　　Daily Output of Ninety Reams
　　[Our Newspaper] The privately-owned Beiyang Paper Mill in this city, which was severely damaged by the Chiang bandit troops last winter, officially resumed operations yesterday (19th) after more than four months of active repairs by all employees. Beiyang Paper Mill is the largest of the five privately-owned paper mills in this city. It was founded in the thirty-sixth year of the Republic of China and has two large paper machines and one calender. Before liberation, it employed more than 60 workers and had a normal output of more than 190 reams (500 sheets per ream) of yellow rough-edged paper and colored paper per day. When our army besieged the city last winter, the Chiang bandit troops were stationed in the factory, attempting to use it to resist. After more than two months of the Chiang bandit troops being stationed there, the factory's electrical appliances, warehouses, iron factory, engineering rooms, employee dormitories, cotton gin,铡草机 (chá cǎo jī, a grass-cutting machine) and a large chimney over eight zhang (丈, a traditional Chinese unit of length, approximately 3.3 meters) high were all destroyed. When the Chiang bandit troops withdrew from the factory, it was a pile of rubble. After the liberation of Beiping, the workers who had been dismissed by the factory returned to the factory on their own initiative. At that time, the factory was not very confident in the recovery of the factory. Later, after repeated persuasion by the workers and with the strong help of the People's Government, it was decided to start the reconstruction project on May 1. During the more than four months of reconstruction, all the workers showed a high degree of enthusiasm for fighting to restore and develop production. In order to take care of the factory's difficulties, they endured many difficulties and insisted on working in extremely abnormal living conditions. Without a place to sleep, the workers automatically lived in the bunkers left by the enemy and puppets. Corn buns were their only food. Worker Xing Guangxiang was hit in the head by a brick while digging a artesian well, but he still insisted on working despite the pain. Wang Baoming and Li Guilin dug the artesian well, which had been converted into a bunker by the bandits, in the bone-chilling water. After careful research, the principle of the locomotive chimney was used with a blower to temporarily replace the huge chimney project. The nine electric motors that were completely destroyed by the Chiang bandit troops were actively worked on by the workers, who patiently searched for the important parts that the bandits had stolen and buried in the field, and reworked them. Six units have now been repaired. In order to quickly supply electricity and resume production, the power company tried its best to borrow a high-voltage meter from another place for the factory to install, restoring power supply. The factory's daily output is now ninety reams (only one machine is running), and there is not much difficulty in preparing raw materials. Experiments will soon be carried out to use rice straw to make rope. If successful, it will not only solve the factory's raw material supply, but also find a way out for the rice straw of farmers in the nearby rice-producing areas.

　　经工人艰苦重建
  　北洋纸厂开工
  　每日产纸九十令
    【本报讯】去冬遭蒋匪军过技师张玉葆和工友们的精严重破坏的本市私营北洋造纸厂，经全体职工四个多月的积极修建，已于昨（十九）日正式复工。北洋造纸厂为本市五家私营造纸厂中规模最大的一家，创始于民国三十六年，共有大型造纸机两台，压光机一台。解放前雇有职工六十多人，正常产量每日可出黄毛边、片艳纸一百九十多令（每令五百张）。去冬我军围城时，蒋匪军即驻扎该厂，企图凭借该厂进行抵抗。经过蒋匪军两个多月的驻扎，该厂的电器、仓库、铁工厂、工事房、职工宿舍、弹棉机、铡草机及八丈多高的大烟囱等均遭破坏。当蒋匪军退出该厂时，已成瓦砾一堆。北平解放后，早被该厂遣散的工友自动回了厂。当时厂方对该厂的恢复信心不高，后经工友们再三劝说和人民政府的大力帮助，始决于五月一日开始重建工程。在四个多月的重建中，全体工友表现了高度的为恢复发展生产而奋斗的热情。为照顾厂方困难，他们忍受了重重困难，在极不正常的生活中仍坚持工作。没有睡觉的地方，工友们自动住在敌伪遗留下的地碉里。窝窝头是他们唯一食品。工友邢广祥在挖自流井时被砖头砸破了脑袋，仍忍痛坚持工作。王宝明和李桂林在冰冷浸骨的井水中挖掘匪军们改建成碉堡的自流井。经心研究，引用火车头烟筒的原理加吹风机，暂时代替了工程浩大的烟囱。为蒋匪军完全破坏的九台电动机，经工友们积极努力，把匪军偷埋在野地里的重要零件耐心地寻觅回来，重加修整，现已修复六台。为了迅速供电，恢复生产，电力公司想尽办法从别处借了高压表为该厂按装，恢复供电。该厂日产量现为九十令（只开动一部机器），原料也没多大困难准备在最近实验用稻草制绳，如获成功，不仅可解决该厂原料供应，并可为附近产稻区农民的稻草，觅得出路。
