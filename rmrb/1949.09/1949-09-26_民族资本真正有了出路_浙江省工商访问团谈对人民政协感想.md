　　National Capital Truly Has a Way Out
  　Zhejiang Provincial Industry and Commerce Delegation Talks About Their Impressions of the People's Political Consultative Conference
　　[Our Newspaper] The Zhejiang Province and Hangzhou City Industry and Commerce Delegation, a group of twenty-two people led by delegation leader Tang Xunze, arrived in Beiping from Shanghai on the afternoon of the 22nd. Shi Lin from the Beiping Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce, Pu Jiexiu from the Industrial Association, and Liu Zhonglin from the Chamber of Commerce greeted them at the station.
　　A reporter paid a special visit to the delegation yesterday morning. It is understood that the main purposes of the delegation's visit are: 1. To learn from the old liberated areas and understand the new democratic economic construction, the development of private industry and commerce, the establishment of new labor-capital relations, and tax policies; 2. Technical investigation, mainly to visit industrial technology; 3. Business negotiations, preparing to sign domestic and foreign trade contracts where possible (mainly exporting silk and tea); 4. Raw material and finished product investigation. Entrusted by the Hangzhou City Industry and Commerce Federation, to investigate and understand the supply and demand of materials. According to Mr. Tang Xunze, the head of the delegation, Hangzhou's industry and commerce have developed abnormally in the past, with a lot of speculative business. How to reform and adapt it to the new democratic economy after liberation is an urgent problem to be solved. The industrial and commercial circles of Hangzhou City, having clarified the people's government's industrial and commercial policies, are no longer taking a wait-and-see attitude and are actively studying how to run factories and businesses well, presenting a new atmosphere.
　　When the topic turned to the convening of the People's Political Consultative Conference, Delegation Leader Tang said to the reporter in a very pleasant tone: "We happened to encounter the convening of this epoch-making meeting during our visit to Beiping, and we are very excited and supportive from the standpoint of the national bourgeoisie. Because there are real people's representatives in the CPPCC, it includes a wide range of revolutionary classes. This time, the national bourgeoisie not only participated in the People's Political Consultative Conference, but also can say what they want to say. This was impossible in the past. In the past, under the oppression and control of imperialism and bureaucratic capital, the real national bourgeoisie could not raise its head at all. Especially the industrial circles in Zhejiang Province have a deeper understanding of this point. For example, silk, a special product of Zhejiang Province, could produce 250,000 dan in 1907, but it had been reduced to more than 6,000 dan during the period of bureaucratic capital control before liberation. This reduction number is a very good explanation. The convening of this CPPCC points out a clear path for us, that is: we should cooperate closely under the leadership of the working class in the future, and strive to restore and develop the new democratic economy, and thereby transform the national bourgeoisie itself." He went on to say: "The national bourgeoisie not only clarified its political direction today, but also has a goal internationally, that is, to learn from the powerful world peace fortress, the socialist social country - the Soviet Union. All our future development and hopes should be directed towards the Soviet Union, learning from the Soviet Union's economic construction and experience, until the completion of the socialist social revolution."
　　It is reported that the delegation will leave for Tianjin, Harbin, Changchun, Xiaofengman, Shenyang, Andong, Anshan and other places after staying in Ping for a few days, and finally participate in the industrial exhibition held in Dalian this time. The entire visit is planned to last for two months.

　　民族资本真正有了出路
  　浙江省工商访问团谈对人民政协感想
    【本报讯】浙江省暨杭州市工商界东北华北访问团一行二十二人由该团唐巽泽团长率领已于二十二日下午由沪抵平。平市工商局石林、工业会浦洁修、商会刘仲霖等亲到车站欢迎。
    记者昨日上午特走访该团。据悉，访问团此次主要的访问目的为：一、由老解放区学习和了解新民主主义经济建设，私营工商业发展情况，劳资双方新关系的建立以及税收政策等；二、技术性的考察。主要是参观工业技术；三、业务接洽。准备在可能条件下订定国内外贸易合同（主要是输出绸、茶）；四、原料成品调查。受杭州市工商界委托，调查了解物资供需情况。据团长唐巽泽先生说：杭州市过去工商业是畸形发展的，投机性的营业很多，解放后应该如何进行改革并使之适应新民主主义经济是一个急待解决的问题。杭州市的工商业界由于明确了人民政府的工商业政策，目前已不再抱观望态度，都在积极研究如何把工厂和商业办好，呈现了一番新的气象。
    当话题转到此次人民政协的召开时，唐团长以极愉快的语调告诉记者：“我们此次到北平刚好碰到这个划时代的会议召开，我们站在民族资产阶级立场表示十分兴奋和拥护。因为政协中有真正的人民代表，它包括了广泛的各革命阶层。民族资产阶级这次不仅参加了人民政协，而且能够讲它所要讲的话，这在过去是不可能的，过去在帝国主义、官僚资本的压迫和统制下，真正的民族资产阶级根本就不能抬头，尤其是浙江的产业界对这点体会得更深刻，例如浙江省的特产——丝，在一九○七年能产二十五万担，而在解放前官僚资本统制时期已减产到六千余担，这个减产的数字就是一个很好的说明。这次政协的召开，更给我们指了一条明路，就是：我们今后应当在工人阶级领导下密切合作，努力恢复和发展新民主主义经济，并从而改造民族资产阶级本身。”他又接着说：“民族资产阶级在今天不惟明确了自己的政治方向，而且在国际上也有了目标，这个目标就是学习强大的世界和平堡垒社会主义社会国家——苏联。我们今后一切发展和希望都要面向着苏联，学习苏联的经济建设和经验，一直到完成社会主义社会革命。”
    闻该团在平逗留数日后即行启程赴天津、哈尔宾、长春、小丰满、沈阳、安东、鞍山等地，最后并参加大连市这次举办的工业展览会。全部访问时间计划为两个月。
