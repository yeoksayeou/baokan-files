Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 15th: According to TASS, the Soviet automobile industry is developing rapidly. The quality of artificial rubber car tires has surpassed that of the United States, and automobile production last year increased by 50% compared to 1947. In the second quarter of this year, the production of passenger cars and trucks increased by 23% (passenger cars) and 38% (trucks) respectively compared to the same quarter last year, and buses increased by 25%. Due to the widespread application of new technologies, the Moscow Automobile Factory will increase its production by 21% this year. In terms of tractor production, a new automatic lathe system designed by the Soviet inventor Inozemstev has been applied in the Stalingrad Tractor Factory. This new automatic lathe conveyor system automatically completes the work of machinists, planers, and grinders. Parts automatically move from one lathe to another along the system, gradually completing the production process. This automatic lathe system was first manufactured in 1940 in the Soviet Union and abroad. Later, it was promoted in Moscow, Leningrad, Kharkov, and Sverdlovsk, and similar equipment only began to appear abroad at this time.

This year, the Soviet rubber industry produced 44% more automobile tires than last year. Factories have mastered the manufacturing of new automobile tires with synthetic rubber, which are known for their durability. Soviet "Balloon" brand automobile tires can travel 30,000 kilometers on roads and highways. Many British and American companies' tires cannot travel such long distances. As is well known, the tires manufactured by the American Goodyear company broke down after only 18,000 kilometers during the war. In addition, new tires specially designed for passenger cars have also been successfully trial-produced in the Soviet Union. Before the war, the Soviet Union ranked first in the world in the production and consumption of synthetic rubber car tires. Based on the experimental results of Academician Lebedev, the Soviet Union began the world's first large-scale industrial production of synthetic rubber in 1932. By the end of the Five-Year Plan, the Soviet Union's production of synthetic rubber will greatly exceed that of 1940, and the production of natural rubber will also increase several times.

　　苏联汽车工业发展
  　广泛装置车床自动系统车胎质量已经超过美国
    【新华社北平十五日电】据塔斯社讯：苏联汽车工业正在迅速发展，人造橡胶汽车轮胎的质量已超过美国的轮胎，去年汽车生产较一九四七年增加百分之五十。今年第二季所制造的客车和大货车较去年同季增加百分之二十三（客车）和百分之三十八（大货车），公共汽车增加百分之二十五。莫斯科汽车工厂由于新技术的广泛应用，今年生产量将提高百分之二十一。在拖拉机生产方面，由苏维埃发明家印诺奇金所设计的新的车床自动系统，已在斯大林格勒拖拉机工厂应用。这一新的车床自动输送系统自动地完成机工、刨工及磨工的工作，机件顺着这一系统从一个车床自动地运转到另一车床，同时即逐渐完成了生产过程。这一车床自动系统在一九四○年时在苏联国内外均属首次制造，后来在莫斯科、列宁格勒、哈尔科夫及斯维德洛夫斯克各地推广，同时在国外也才开始出现这种装置。
    苏联橡胶工业今年所生产的汽车胎比去年增加百分之四十四。工厂已精通了用人造橡胶制造新汽车胎，这种人造橡胶的车胎以经久耐用闻名。苏联汽球牌汽车轮胎，能走三万公里的大路与公路。许多英美公司出品的汽车胎都走不了这样长的距离。如所周知，美国固德立公司所制造的车胎，在战时只走一万八千公里就坏了。此外，专为载客汽车用的新车胎，也已在苏联试制成功。苏联在人造橡胶汽车轮胎的生产和消费方面，在战前就已占世界第一位。根据科学院院士列别杰夫的实验结果，苏联在一九三二年便开始了在工业上大量制造人造橡胶的世界创举。在战后五年计划结束时，苏联所生产的人造橡胶，将大大超过一九四○年，同时天然橡胶的生产，也将增加好几倍。
