　　Shijiazhuang Coking Plant Coke
　　Sells Well in Shanghai, Nanjing, and Other Places
　　[Shijiazhuang Electric] With the victorious development of the revolutionary situation and the gradual restoration and smooth flow of transportation, the sales of coke produced by the coking plant are expanding daily. The plant produces more than 3,000 tons of coke per month. At the beginning of Shijiazhuang's liberation, about 1,200 tons were sold to Yangquan every month, followed by about 700 to 800 tons sold in small quantities to central Hebei, leaving a surplus of more than 1,000 tons. After the liberation of Tianjin and Beiping, sales channels for coke in Tanggu and Tianjin were opened. By June of this year, the plant still had a surplus of more than 10,000 tons of coke. After the liberation of Nanjing and Shanghai, various public enterprises in the Nanjing and Shanghai area rushed to sign contracts with the plant to pre-purchase coke. In order to develop its business and open up sales channels, the plant sent personnel to Shanghai, Nanjing, Tianjin and other places to understand the situation and promote its products. Since the beginning of July, large-scale transportation to Pukou has begun, with about 200 to 300 tons each time, and a maximum of 500 tons at one time. Up to now, the plant has transported and sold about 7,000 tons of coke to Pukou, Nanjing, Shanghai and other places. It is estimated that about 1,000 tons of coke have been sold to Shanghai. Half of the plant's coke reserves have now been sold.
