Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 11th: TASS, Sofia - Marshal Bulganin, head of the Soviet delegation attending the celebration of the fifth anniversary of Bulgaria's liberation, delivered a speech at the Sofia conference on the 8th, stating:

    Dear comrades, friends, and citizens of the People's Republic of Bulgaria! On behalf of the Soviet government, the Soviet people, and the armed forces, and on the orders of the great Stalin, I extend my respects and warm congratulations to you on the occasion of Bulgaria's National Day, the fifth anniversary of the establishment of the people's government. The epoch-making victory of the Soviet army over the fully armed fascist German army five years ago created the conditions under which the Bulgarian people, under the leadership of the Bulgarian Communist Party and its leader Comrade Dimitrov, overthrew the royal fascist regime that the people deeply hated. The Soviet victory over fascist Germany and the armed uprising of the Bulgarian people on September 9, 1944, ushered in a new era in Bulgarian history.

    The former rulers of Bulgaria left the Bulgarian people only a painful legacy. However, the Bulgarian working people were not discouraged by the difficulties. They rose up to fight the difficulties, following the Bulgarian Communist Party on the only correct path of building socialism. In a short period of time, the workers, peasants, and intellectuals of democratic Bulgaria have achieved great accomplishments in economic and cultural construction.

    The Soviet people are happy to point out these achievements. The Soviet Union, the great Stalin (at this moment, the hall resounded with stormy applause, cheers, and shouts of "Long live Stalin!"), regards every new victory of the Bulgarian people on the road to socialism as cordial and precious, and provides assistance to the restoration and development of the Bulgarian national economy. The political and cultural cooperation between our two countries is strengthening year by year.

    The experience of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries has convinced the working people of the world that only socialism can guarantee national independence, genuine democracy, and the gradual improvement of the living standards of the working masses.

    Every true socialist and democrat must recognize that his main task is to strengthen the strength of the democratic camp, to strengthen the friendship between the people's democratic countries and the friendship with the Soviet Union (applause).

    Any attempt to weaken this friendship, any action that deviates even slightly from the Leninist-Stalinist principles of socialism and proletarian internationalism, means betraying one's own people and inevitably causing one's country to lose its national independence and become a colony of imperialism.

    The tragic fate of Yugoslavia is the result of this. The traitor Tito and his servants have turned Yugoslavia into a secret police hell, where any expression of free thought and human rights is suppressed, and where the advanced representatives of the working class, working peasants, and intellectuals are being brutally eliminated. After separating from the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, Yugoslavia is becoming more and more a colony of international, primarily American, imperialism.

    All progressive mankind condemns these despicable traitors, agents and helpers of imperialism. However, the Yugoslav people will have the opportunity to speak freely. The traitors will not escape the severe judgment of their people.

    History shows that the people who have been liberated from the yoke of American imperialism can only firmly embark on the road to independence and socialism in close friendship with the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries.

    The Bulgarian people, faithful to the legacy of their leader, Comrade Dimitrov, constantly guided by the teachings of Lenin and Stalin, are resolutely advancing along this great road (applause). Comrades, working people of free Bulgaria, you face great tasks in the struggle for socialism. No matter what trials you may encounter on your path, you need not doubt that you can find selfless and genuine friendship in the Soviet Union and in Stalin himself, who are ready to support the Bulgarian brothers in every way.

　　代表苏联亲往保国祝贺
　  布尔加宁发表演说
    盛赞两国合作日益增强
    【新华社北平十一日电】塔斯社索非亚讯：苏联出席保加利亚解放五周年庆祝大会的代表团团长布尔加宁元帅，八日在保京大会上发表演说称：
    亲爱的保加利亚人民共和国的同志们、朋友们、男女公民们！我代表苏联政府、苏联人民与武装部队，代表伟大的斯大林并奉他的命令，当保加利亚国庆日，人民政权建立五周年之际，向你们致敬并致热烈的贺忱。苏军五年前对全副武装的法西斯德国军队的划时代的胜利，创造了种种条件，保国人民在这些条件下，在保共及其领袖季米特洛夫同志的领导下，推翻了人民所深恶痛绝的保皇法西斯政权。苏联对法西斯德国的胜利，与保加利亚人民一九四四年九月九日的武装起义使得保加利亚的历史进入了新的时代。
    保加利亚前统治者只给保国人民留下了痛苦的遗产。可是，保加利亚劳动人民并未因困难而气馁。他们起而对困难进行斗争，跟随着保共走上了唯一正确的建设社会主义的道路。民主保加利亚的工农与知识分子在短暂的时间内便在经济与文化建设方面达成了巨大的成就。
    苏联人民乐于指出这些成就。苏联、伟大的斯大林（这时会场上响起了暴风雨般的鼓掌、欢呼、为斯大林欢呼万岁）把保加利亚人民在走向社会主义途中所获得的每一新胜利都看作是亲切而珍贵的，并且对保国国民经济的恢复和发展予以援助，我们两国间的政治与文化的合作正在一年年地加强。
    苏联的经验，人民民主国家的经验，使全世界的劳动人民相信：只有社会主义才能保证民族独立，真正的民主与劳动群众生活水平的步步提高。
    每一个真正的社会主义者与民主分子，必须认识他的主要任务就是加强民主阵营的力量，加强人民民主国家间的友谊及对苏联的友谊（鼓掌）。
    任何削弱这种友谊的企图、丝毫脱离列宁斯大林的社会主义与无产阶级国际主义原则的行动都意味着背叛他自己的人民，而且不可避免地使其国家丧失国家独立而变为帝国主义的殖民地。
    南斯拉夫的悲惨命运就是这样造成的。叛徒铁托及其仆从把南斯拉夫变成了秘密警察的地狱，那里任何自由思想的表现及人权都遭受了摧残，那里工人阶级、劳动农民及知识分子的先进代表，正被横暴地消灭。与苏联及人民民主国家分离之后，南国就一天天地变成国际的、首先是美帝国主义的殖民地。
    一切进步人类都斥责这些卑鄙的叛徒、帝国主义的代理人与助手。然而，南国人民将有机会畅所欲言。叛徒逃不掉他们人民的严厉判决。
    历史指明：从帝国主义美桎梏下解放了的人民，只有在与苏联、与人民民主国家的亲密友谊中才能坚定地走向独立、走向社会主义的道路。
    忠于其领袖——季米特洛夫同志遗训的保加利亚人民，经常以列宁斯大林的学说为指针，正坚决地沿着这条大路前进（鼓掌）。同志们，自由保加利亚的劳动人民们，在争取社会主义的斗争中，你们面临着巨大的任务。不论你们在你们的道路上会遇到怎样的考验，你们都用不着怀疑；你们定可在苏联与斯大林本人那里找到无私的真正的友谊，他们正准备用种种办法支持保加利亚的兄弟。
