Rebuilding from the Ruins
  A Record of the Reconstruction Work at Pangjiabao, Xuanhua

The reconstruction work at the Pangjiabao Mine of the Xuanhua Longyan Iron Mine began in August. This is an important, arduous, and gratifying start. Pangjiabao is a rich mine, with iron ore content reaching 62 percent. If such a mine, from destruction to reconstruction, from ruin to rebirth, can exert its due strength, its contribution to the country's economic construction will be invaluable.

The Pangjiabao Mine is changing; the dilapidated scene is gradually being replaced by new construction and orderly renovation.

In the past, six 2.0 high-voltage lines transmitting 77,000 volts from Xiahuayuan have been converted into three 33,000-volt lines. Workers from the North China Electric Power Company have successfully completed this work in the scorching heat, which is an important first step in the recovery work. Relying on this major power conduit, veteran miners are working to rebuild the 800-meter-high water-lifting equipment and repair the remaining machinery. The workers excitedly said, "This is really starting!"

More than 1,500 horsepower of electric motors, air compressors, transformers, and other valuable machinery buried in the rubble are being sorted out. Most of the electric motors have been dug out of the rubble and covered with steel plates. The workers will soon begin a thorough cleaning. They said, "The people who openly sabotage are gone, but there are still many enemies hidden in the mine. These are rust, wind, and rain."

An old worker named Qi Dezhong found a 25-horsepower electric motor for streetcars in the drain of the tram house. When he saw the electric motor pressed under weeds and rocks in the ditch, his emotions surged. He jumped into the ditch and lifted the machine, which usually requires two or three people to move.

The 15-li-long mountain road has been repaired, using more than 1,500 workdays.

The construction of 3,500 square meters of housing began a few days ago. Housing that can accommodate 500 employees will be completed before winter. Engineers and surveyors have examined the site again and again for this construction, carefully estimating the old foundations, bricks, and tiles, as well as all the new materials needed, anticipating various possible situations in advance, and revising the already completed blueprints several times. They have been working with bloodshot eyes and aching legs, "rebuilding from the ruins." This is the picture at Pangjiabao.

Recently, Longyan Iron Mine formulated a five-month reconstruction plan. The outline of the plan is: to build a small machinery repair factory including 50 technicians, to erect 3,000 meters of 3,300-volt transmission lines for the mine itself, to renovate water sources No. 1 to No. 4, to repair pump houses No. 4, 5, and 6, to sort out and clean 2 to 4 kilometers of tunnels, and to rebuild a 500 to 1,000-ton sand storage.

Everything is being done to strive for a daily output of 500 to 1,000 tons of iron ore by next summer.

Pangjiabao is revived! The years of abandonment and cruel destruction will never happen again. The new challenges in the forward march are: insufficient funds; lack of technical and management personnel; and the 43-kilometer-long railway is still paralyzed. It is hoped that relevant departments will gradually resolve these problems.

### 从废墟上重建起来　记宣化庞家堡的重建工作

　　从废墟上重建起来
  　记宣化庞家堡的重建工作
    宣化龙烟铁矿庞家堡矿场，从八月份开始了重建工作，这是一个重要、艰巨而可喜的肇始。庞家堡是一个富矿，矿砂含铁达百分之六十二。从破坏到重建，从毁灭到新生，这样的矿场如果发挥了它应有的力量，对于祖国的经济建设的贡献，将是非常可贵的。
    庞家堡矿场在变着样子，破烂的景象逐渐为新的建设和有条有理的整补所代替了。
    昔日自下花园输送七万七千伏特的六条二点零高压线，已改做为三万三千伏特的三条线。华北电业公司的工友们在酷热的气候里胜利完成这一工作，这是恢复工作中重要的第一步。凭着这一个大的动力管，矿山的老工友们正着手重建高达八百公尺的打水设备，和整修剩余的机械。工友们兴奋的说：“这可开始了！”
    被压在瓦砾堆里数达千五百匹马力以上的电动机和压风机、变压器等贵重机械，正在被整理着。电动机已大都从瓦砾中挖了出来，盖上了钢板。最近工友们就要开始来一个彻底的擦洗，他们说：“公开破坏的人是没有了，暗藏的在矿上的敌人却不少。这就是锈、风吹、雨打。”
    一个名叫齐德仲的老工友，从电车房的地沟里，找到了一部电车用的二十五匹马力的电动机。他看见电动机被杂草石块压在沟里，立刻情感沸腾。跳下沟去，搬起了通常必须两、三个人才能搬动的这部机器。
    全长十五里的山腰公路，已修补完竣，用工一千五百多个。
    三千五百平方公尺的房舍建筑，已于日前动工，可容五百职工的房舍，将于冬季以前完成。工程师、测绘人员为着这个建筑，看了一次又一次，精密的估计了旧留的房基、砖瓦，和需用的一切新材料，事先预见到各种可能遇到的情况，几次修改了已经做好的蓝图。他们熬红了眼，累酸了腿，“从废墟上重建起来”。在庞家堡，就是这幅图景。
    最近龙烟铁矿拟定了一个五个月的重建计划。计划的梗概是：建设一个包括技术工五十人的小型机械修理厂，架设矿山本身三千三百伏特的输电线三千米，整修一号至四号水源地，修好四、五、六号水泵房，整理清扫二公里至四公里的坑道，重建五百至一千吨砂库一个，新铺轻便道轨六千米。
    一切都在为着争取明年夏季日产铁砂五百至一千吨而奋斗。
    庞家堡复活了！被遗弃被惨酷破坏的岁月将不会再有。新的前进中的困难是：资金不足；技术人员和管理人员的缺乏；全长四十三公里的铁路还是一幅瘫痪状态。希望有关部门逐步予以解决。
