　　Returning to the Ranks of the People's Air Force
    ——A Conversation with an Air Force Mechanic
    Mao Xuan
    My name is Jiang Bingheng. I left the Kuomintang Air Force in 1947. Counting from that year, I’ve been working in the air force for eleven years. "Farmers love the land, and workers love machines." I studied aircraft mechanics, so I was tied to airplanes. Otherwise, I would have quit long before 1947. I started learning aircraft mechanics in 1935, and in 1936 I became a mechanic. I've been dealing with airplanes ever since. In these dozen years, I learned how to repair P-51s, B-24s, C-46s, and P-43s. You see, with airplanes and my skills as a technician, I would be "a hero with no place to use his skills" if I left the airplanes. So, even though I was mistreated, I had to endure it. To be honest, when I left the air force, I was willing to give up everything except the airplanes. It wasn't until 1947 that I really couldn't take it anymore. At that time, with the help of my older brother, he asked me, "You love airplanes, but who are you repairing them to fight? Who are you going to bomb?" That one sentence woke me up.
    I am a member of the Kuomintang, but let’s not talk about that. In the Kuomintang Air Force, ten out of ten are party members, but how did they join the party? Let me tell you this story: In the past, we had a mechanic, and one day the political instructor called him in. The first question he asked was about his understanding of the party. When he heard that, he knew they wanted him to join the party, so he deliberately answered that he had an understanding and that the Soviet party was better than the American party. The instructor immediately turned his face and asked why the Soviet party was better. He said that the Soviet party was at a 45-degree angle, while the American party was at a 30-degree angle, so the Soviet one was better. The instructor was completely baffled; he had been doing it for so many years and didn't know anything about party-degree theory. So he explained, "I'm talking about wheel chocks (挡) [dang], what party are you talking about?" The instructor realized he was being deliberately disruptive, so he directly asked him if he wanted to join the Kuomintang. He told the instructor that he would join the party if he got paid for not working, but joining the party would not only require him to work but also deduct party dues from his salary, so he wouldn't join. This immediately led to a falling out with the instructor. But they didn't do anything to him at the time; when it came to collective party membership, they still issued him a membership application form. After reading it, he didn't say a word and wrote five big characters on the form: "I will not join the party." This caused quite a stir. The director called him in to talk, asking him why he wouldn't join the party and if he had any background. He said, "A gentleman does not form factions." The director frowned and said, "If you don't join, then leave!" He still didn't join the party. Leaving was one thing, but then someone followed him, and he might be labeled and thrown in jail one day. You see, not joining the party was impossible.
    The political instructor would just peddle snake oil, saying that everyone was of one mind after joining the party, but he himself knew that no one was of one mind with him. The biggest task for Kuomintang members was to pay party dues. Group meetings were also held. At those meetings, party members would complain that their salaries were not enough and that prices were rising sharply. Every time, that's all they talked about, so the instructor simply stopped calling them.
    The Kuomintang could hide things from anyone, but not from its air force. After Japan surrendered, Chairman Mao went to Chongqing for peace talks. The people of Chongqing were jumping for joy, parading and demonstrating, and shouting things like "Permit good, not permit bad." But I knew better: don't be happy, there won't be peace. It wasn't that I didn't want peace. You see, Chairman Mao got off the plane at Jiulongpo in Chongqing, but Bai Shi Yi Airport in Chongqing was busy day and night transporting troops and ammunition to the Northeast and North China, preparing to attack the Liberated Areas. How could there be peace? Later, the Political Consultative Conference was held, and the Kuomintang's "peace representatives" ran to Jiulongpo every day, making it seem like there was some hope for peace. But if you went another forty li to Bai Shi Yi Airport, you would be disheartened. The Fourth Squadron was the Kuomintang's self-proclaimed strongest air force. During the War of Resistance, it had been hiding in the rear, but in 1946, it was transferred to Beiping. Wasn't that obvious? It was to fight the Communists.
    When we got to Beiping, the officials were busy taking over. They asked me to take over as well, and I received over a dozen broken-down trucks. What kind of taking over was that? It was simply asking me to be responsible for repairs. After the cars were repaired, the communications chief drove them around for fun every day, and two of them broke down as soon as they were fixed. I was furious. He was a captain, so if it were someone else, I wouldn't say anything. If they broke down, they would just pile them up with the broken cars and be done with it. But I couldn't stand it, so I went to find him. When I found him and questioned him, I offended him. He was my superior officer, so you can imagine how good that was for me. He found fault with me for no reason.
    At that time, I really didn't want to keep doing it. Just then, my older brother came to Beiping and came to find me. I told him my frustrations, and he said not to do it anymore. At that time, how did I know he was an underground Communist Party member? He just said that the Communist Party was good, but what would I do if I didn't do this? At that time, I was always a little hesitant.
    Not many days later, I was repairing an airplane when the communications chief called me and gave me ten minutes to report the numbers and conditions of all the airplanes in the Fourth Squadron. This was clearly finding fault. You see, the Fourth Squadron had over sixty airplanes, some in Tianjin, some in Shanghai, and some in Wuhu. You couldn't even send a telegram that fast! At that time, I told him that I couldn't do it, and he immediately labeled me as resisting orders from a superior officer. I told him that I was resisting, that I couldn't do it, that I wasn't going to do it anymore. From that time on, I left the airplanes that I had been reluctant to leave for over a dozen years.
    I met my older brother in Tianjin and asked him what to do. He told me to go to the Northeast, saying that there were also airplanes there. But I thought: I've been working on the Kuomintang side for over a dozen years, and I don't have an introducer. If I suddenly go over there, they might detain me, and that would be troublesome. Later, seeing that I was a little hesitant, he said we should go together. That gave me confidence, but when he was about to leave, his wife was about to give birth. After a few days, he said he wasn't going anymore. So I waited!
    The cannons around Tianjin were firing, and the sound of the cannons got closer and closer. My heart was being scratched more and more, and I couldn't wait to see the People's Liberation Army immediately. I had been waiting for two years!
    After Tianjin was liberated, I ran into former air force personnel on the street, all wearing civilian clothes. But I had been wearing a gown for two years, so I put on my air force uniform at that time. Others looked at me strangely, but I knew what I was doing. As soon as the air force reporting office was established, I went to report. The comrades said that I wasn't an active-duty air force member, so they wouldn't register me yet and told me to go back. I was disheartened when I heard that, but I couldn't have waited for two years for nothing! I didn't leave and told them what I could do and why I had quit in the past. They introduced me to the director to talk, and I told the director about the detailed circumstances of the past again. He encouraged me and told me to go home and wait for recruitment.
    I remember very clearly that on January 16th, the director personally came to find me and asked if I knew how to repair P-51s. That was what I had learned! I told him that I could as long as there were enough parts. We went to the aircraft factory together, and I saw that they were the ones the Fourth Squadron had abandoned and couldn't use. In the past, they couldn't have been repaired, but now that they were liberated, the airplanes also had to be liberated. The first P-51 airplane of the People's [Air Force] that flew from Tianjin to Beijing in North China was the one I repaired. This was finally a little service I could do after I began to embrace the people!
    In the Kuomintang [Air Force], if seven out of ten airplanes could fly, that was a 100% record. Often, five out of ten airplanes were on sick leave. Now our tools and materials are not as complete as they used to be, but the airplanes that the Fourth Squadron abandoned have all turned over a new leaf. We guarantee that the ones that can fly will fly, and we try to make the ones that can't fly fly. Now we guarantee to fly as many as we can. This sounds a bit mysterious, but the reason is very simple: everyone understands that the airplanes we repaired back then were to bomb the common people, but now they are to save the common people...

　　回到人民空军的队伍
    ——记一个空军机械员的谈话
    毛宣
    我叫姜秉衡，民国三十六年脱离了国民党空军，从那年算，干空军是已经十一年了。“庄稼人爱地，工人爱机器”，我学的是飞机机械，也就叫飞机给扯着腿了。要不然等不到三十六年，早就不干了。我是在二十四年学空军机械，二十五年做了机械士，就一直跟飞机打交道，在这十几年里，学会了修Ｐ５１、Ｂ２４、Ｃ４６、Ｐ４３。你想：有飞机，我有技术，是技术人员，要是离开飞机可就是“英雄无用武之地”了。所以，虽然受气也得忍着。说老实话，脱离空军我什么都舍得，就是舍不得飞机。一直到三十六年，那气实在没法再受了，当时又有我哥哥的帮助，他问我：“你爱飞机，可是你修好飞机去打谁啊？去炸谁啊？”这一句话可把我打通了。
    我是国民党员，你就别提这个了，国民党空军，十个有十个是党员，可是怎么入的党啊？我给你说这么件事：过去我们那里有个机械员，有一天指导员把他叫去了，第一句话就问他对党的认识怎么样？他一听就是要让他入党，就故意的回答说有认识，苏联的党，比美国的党好。指导员一听马上就翻了脸，问他为什么苏联党好。他说这苏联的党是四十五度，美国党是三十度，苏联的就是比美国的好。指导员一听可就摸不着头绪了，他干了那么些年也不知道党论度。于是他就解释说：“我说的是轮挡（党）（注）你说的是什么党啊？”指导员一听他是有点故意捣蛋，就直截了当的问他入不入国民党。他就告诉指导员不干活给钱就入党，入了党不但干活，还得从薪金里扣党费，所以不入党。这一下就跟指导员闹崩了。可是当时没把他怎样，集体入党的时候照样发了他一份入党志愿表。他看了以后一句话也没说，在表上大大的写了五个字：“本人不入党”，这下可闹坏了。主任找他谈话，问他为什么不入党，是否有背景？他说：“君子不党”。主任把脸一绷说：“你要不入，就走！”他还是不入党，走了倒没什么，可是就有人跟上了，说不定那天扣个帽子就得坐监牢。你瞧这不入党那行啊？
    指导员就会卖膏药，说什么入了党大家一条心，其实他自己就知道没有谁跟他一条心。国民党员的最大任务就是交党费。小组会也开过，那会一开会，党员们就提薪金不够用，物价涨的厉害，每次都是提这个，后来指导员索性就不叫开了。
    国民党的事情，什么人都能瞒，就是瞒不了他的空军。日本投降以后，毛主席到重庆去进行和平谈判。重庆的人们都喜的乱蹦乱跳，游行示威，还喊什么“许好不许坏”。可是我心里有准啊，甭高兴，和不了。我倒不是不愿意和平，你想，毛主席在重庆九龙坡下飞机，可是重庆白市驿机场一天到晚的忙着往东北、华北运兵运军火准备进攻解放区，那还有个和？后来开了政协会，国民党的“和平代表”天天往九龙坡跑，看起来很有点和平的样子，可是你要再走上四十里到白市驿机场一看，你就寒心了。四大队是国民党自称为最强的空军，抗战时一直躲在大后方，可是三十五年就调到了北平，那还不明显，就是打共产党去吗？
    到了北平，官儿们都忙着接收。也叫我接收，接收了十几辆破卡车，那里是接收啊？简直就是叫我负责修理。汽车修好了，通信长天天开着玩，刚修好就开坏了两部。我一看就火了。他是个上尉，要是别人就不说了，坏了就坏了，往坏汽车里一堆完事大吉。我可看不下去这个，就找他去了，找到他一问，可碰了他的面子了。他是我的长官，你想那还有我的好？没事就找我的岔子。
    当时我可真不想再干了，正赶上我哥哥到北平来，他就找我来了。我把苦闷跟他一说，他说别干了，那会我那里知道他是共产党的地下党员？他光说共产党好，可是不干怎么办呢？当时心里总是有点犹疑。
    没等几天，我正在修飞机，通信长给我来了个电话，限十分钟把四大队所有飞机号码、情况做个报告。这是明明的找岔，你想：四大队的飞机六十多架，有的在天津，有的在上海，还有的在芜湖，打电报也不能那么快哪！当时我就回他我干不了，一下就给我扣了个大帽子，说是反抗长官命令。我告诉他我就是反抗，干不了，不干了。从那时我就离开这十几年舍不得离开的飞机了。
    到天津见到了我哥哥，问他怎么办。他叫我去东北，说那边也有飞机。可是我想：在国民党这边干了十几年，也没个介绍人，突然跑到那边去，到那边把我扣起来可就麻烦了。后来他看我有点犹疑，就说一块走。这一说我心里就有了底了，可是等他要走的时候，刚好妻子要生小孩。过了些日子，他又说不走了。等着吧！
    天津四周的炮响了，炮声一声比一声近了，我心里的小手就越抓弄的厉害，恨不能马上看见解放军。等了两年了！
    天津解放后，在街上碰到了过去的空军都换上了便服。可是我穿了两年大褂，这会就把空军服穿上。别人都看着我莫明其妙，可是我心里有底儿。空军报到处刚一成立，我就去报到。同志们说不是现役空军，先不进行登记，叫我回去。一听可就寒心了，可是等了两年不能白等啊！我不走，跟他们说我会什么，过去为什么不干的。他们给我介绍到主任那里去谈，把过去的详细情形，跟主任又说了一遍。他鼓励了我一番，叫我回家听候录用。
    我还记得很清楚，是一月十六那天，主任亲自去找我，问我会不会修Ｐ５１。那是我学的就是这门哪！我告诉他不缺零件就行。我们一同到了机厂，一看是四大队扔下不能用的，这要在过去是不能修的，可是解放了，飞机也得解放。华北的第一架从天津飞到北京的人民的Ｐ５１飞机就是我修的。这总算我开始投向人民怀抱后的一点效劳吧！
    国民党的飞机十架有七架能飞，就是百分之百的纪录，经常是十架有五架请病假。这会我们的工具、材料各方面都不如那会完善，可是四大队扔下的飞机，都翻身了，能飞的保证飞，不能飞的也想法叫他飞。现在是有多少架保证飞多少架。这听起来有点玄虚，可是道理很简单，就是大家都闹清了，那会修的飞机是炸老百姓，这会是救老百姓……
