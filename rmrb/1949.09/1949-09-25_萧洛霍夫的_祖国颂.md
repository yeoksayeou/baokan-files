　　Sholokhov's "Ode to the Motherland"
    (Translated by Zhang Tianen, published by Guanghua Bookstore)

    "Ode to the Motherland" is a short story by Sholokhov, or rather: a confession based on an ordinary story; an ode—a confession of hatred towards the American imperialists who hate the Soviet people; an ode to the Soviet Union, the motherland of the working class.

    The protagonists of the story are all simple and ordinary farmers. They rarely talk about themselves in their daily work, let alone give patriotic speeches. However, the author uses these few farmers to illustrate the tremendous spiritual changes that have taken place in the Russian people during the period of the Soviet system, and the extremely novel and noble moral qualities they have cultivated in the years of the several Stalin Five-Year Plans. In this way, the author finally establishes the image of the real Soviet people in front of the readers, and behind them, the magnificent prospect of the Soviet motherland is set off.

    In the early 1930s, when comprehensive collectivization began in the Don River basin, the author took a carriage from Millerovo station to Veshenskaya. On the way, he met his first protagonist, his coachman Prokofyevich—an elderly but youthful and handsome Cossack. At that time, as his coachman said, the situation of villages in the area participating in collective farms was: "divided into two halves: one half has joined, and the other half is still hesitant, like sheep standing at the door of the sheepfold. Everyone comes to the meeting, and they fight and make noise at the meeting, just like a bunch of little roosters... There is crying and laughing, it's endless!" The struggle between collectivization and anti-collectivization was going on fiercely. Although Prokofyevich hated those individual farmers who opposed collectivization, he still adopted a wait-and-see attitude, fearing that collectivization would be more "worrying" than individual farming.

    However, in the village of Nizhne-Yablonovsky, the author met another old man. This character reflects the active labor enthusiasm and high sense of collectivism of the farmers who participated in the collective farms at that time, giving us a strong indication of the bright future of collectivization. This old man had been working hard for the collective farm for four days and four nights without rest. He drove his family's horse, a cow, and two bulls to the public livestock farm. No one forced him to do so. He joined the collective farm of his own free will. During the long winter nights, he told himself: "Old people have always slept poorly, and now it's even harder to sleep in this world. It's clear that an official always thinks our farmers' lives are easy, but this idea is wrong. Not long ago, a person sent by the district came to our village; just when I was driving my livestock to hand over to the collective farm, he said to me: 'Now, old man, take a free breath! You don't have to worry about anything, you don't have to manage the livestock, and you don't have to worry about feeding the livestock. Your winter life only has two things: eating and sleeping, but during spring plowing and summer harvest, you can help the collective farm as much as you can.'..." He continued: "Did I join the collective farm to eat for free? When my legs can still stand and my hands are strong, I should always work, otherwise I will be bored to death without work! That's what he meant, I handed over the livestock to everyone, and I should also draw a cross and say thank God I don't have to suffer anymore! No, that's not the case at all." On the contrary, he was melancholy because of this new change, but what kind of melancholy was this?—During the transition period from individual farmers to collective farmers, he felt that his enthusiasm for labor had no place to use, he said: "...my cattle are in the public livestock pen, and my good and comfortable days have begun... The distress of these comfortable days has fallen on my heart, which is more uncomfortable than heartburn."

    Fifteen or sixteen years later, when collectivization had achieved universal success in the Soviet Union, the author came to see the old man in the village of Nizhne-Yablonovsky again. The author was no longer traveling by carriage but by car. The old man had become the chairman of the collective farm, wearing a military uniform—he had participated in the war on the front lines during the Great Patriotic War. The old man, who was more than sixty years old, served as an infantryman. He said: "Yes, I am old enough to suffer, but I went voluntarily, so I must persevere and endure, because the Germans occupied many of our places. Since I went to serve as a soldier, that means I am responsible for myself." In the war, half of the village was burned down by the German invaders, the school was destroyed, the horses and bulls were gone, and the tractors were destroyed—the collective farm suffered fatal losses; but they used their labor to rebuild everything! Here, we are told how the people in the Soviet rear countryside worked with a high degree of consciousness during the war, and the women shouldered the same heavy burdens as the Red Army on the front lines; we are told how the Soviet people emerged victorious from hardship and built their motherland. Sholokhov sings the praises of the millions of Soviet people who have worked and are working tirelessly in various departments, driven by a strong aspiration—to serve their great motherland; he sings the praises of socialism.

    Mardanova, a collective farmer from Kursk Province who was awarded the glorious title of Hero of Socialist Labor, said in her thank-you speech: "In my life,... I have never been so happy and joyful as today. For all this, for all this, I most sincerely thank him—dear Comrade Stalin. He has made my life happy and bright. I want to work more and better, and never be satisfied with the achievements I have made, in order to repay Comrade Stalin for his meticulous care for me and for all the ordinary people like me." This is the sincere voice of the Soviet people.

    In the thirty years of the Soviet regime's existence, under the leadership of Stalin, the Soviet Union has never known failure, whether in war or in overcoming any difficulties. It won the final victory in the anti-fascist war at the cost of unheard-of sacrifices and suffering of the people, and is healing the wounds of war and carrying out new construction at an astonishingly magical speed; however, American imperialism is seeking its savior in the war, trying to instill its people with aggressive emotions, and igniting the ambition of "conquering the world" among the people with absurd and poisonous propaganda. They are doing everything possible to stir up hatred and hatred towards the Soviet Union. Therefore, the author warns at the beginning of the article: the new fascists are still alive, "and are still generously spending billions of dollars to manufacture atomic bombs, preparing for new and terrible wars. Let our irreconcilable hatred for them also live! It will be useful when the time comes!"

### 萧洛霍夫的“祖国颂”

　　萧洛霍夫的“祖国颂”
    （张天恩译·光华书店发行）
    “祖国颂”是萧洛霍夫的一个短篇小说，或者更恰当些说：是一篇以一段平常的故事为主题的告白；是一篇颂歌——对于仇视苏联人民的美帝的告白；对于无产阶级劳苦大众的祖国苏联的颂歌。
    故事的主人公都是很朴质而平常的农民，他们在日常的工作中很少谈论自己，更不作爱国的演讲，但作者就通过这很少的几个农民，说明了在苏维埃制度存在的期间内，俄国人精神上所起的极大的变化，以及他们在几个斯大林五年计划的年代中，所养成的极其新颖的高尚的道德品质。这样，作者最后就把真正的苏维埃人的形象树立在读者的面前，而在他们的后面，陪衬出苏联祖国的雄伟的远景。
    一九三○年初，当顿河流域开始实行全面集体化的时候，作者从米列罗沃车站乘着马车到维辛斯卡雅，在路上他遇到了他的第一个主人公，他的驭手普洛柯夫叶维奇——他是个上了年岁但却年青力壮身材漂亮的哥萨克。那时这一带村庄参加集体农场的情形，如他的驭手所说：“分成了两半：一半人加入了，另一半现在还犹疑不定，象羊站在羊卷门口似的，开会可大家都来，在会场上又打又闹，就活象一群小公鸡一样……有哭有笑，简直说不完！”集体化与反集体化的斗争在激烈地进行着，普洛柯夫叶维奇虽然憎厌那些反对集体化的个体农民，但却仍然抱着观望态度，他怕集体化了会比个体的更“操心”。
    然而在尼日涅亚勃罗诺夫斯基村，作者遇到了另一个老汉，从这个人物，反映出来了当时参加集体农场的农民的积极的劳动热情和高度的集体感，给我们强有力地暗示出集体化必然成功的光明的前途。这个老汉已经四天四夜不休息，他为集体农场的事情苦心焦虑。他把家里的马，一只牝牛和两只公牛都赶到公共畜场去，谁也没有强拉他，他入集体农场是自己情愿的。冬天的长夜，他讲述着他自己：“年老的人一向是睡不酣，如今这种世道就更睡不着，很明白，一个当职员的人总是把我们农民们的生活想得很容易，但是，这种想法是不对的。不久前，我们村里来了一个区上派来的人；恰好我把自己的牲口赶去交给集体农场的时候，他对我说：‘现在，老爸爸，自由的喘口气吧！什么也不用你担心，牲畜不要你经管，喂牲畜的事你也不必挂心。你的冬天生活只有两件事：吃饭和睡觉，不过，春耕夏收的时候，你有多少力量就帮集体农场干多少活吧。’……”他继续讲着：“莫非我入集体农场是为的白吃饭？当我的腿还能站得起，手巴里有力的时候，总是应当干活的，要不然没有活干非把我闲得闷死不可！照他的意思就是这么回事，我把牲口交给大家，还应当画个十字，说一声谢天谢地我再也不受苦了！不是，绝不是这么回事。”他反而因这新的变换而忧郁了，但这忧郁是哪一种的呢？—在从个体农民变作集体农民的过渡时期，他觉得他的劳动的热情没有地方用了，他说：“…我的牛在公共畜圈里，我的好过自在的日子开头了…这种自在日子的苦恼也就掉在我的心上了，比烧心病还难受。”
    十五六年之后，当集体化在苏联已获得普遍的成功的时候，作者又来看尼日涅亚勃罗诺夫斯基村的这位老汉，作者已经不再是坐马车而是坐小汽车了。老汉已经作了集体农庄的主席，他身穿军衣——在卫国战争时期，他参战到前线去过。六十多岁的老汉当步兵，他说：“是的，我这样大的年纪是够受的，但是那是我自愿去的，那就必须坚持忍耐，因为德国人侵占了我们的许多地方，既然我去当兵，那就是说我对自己负责。”在战争里，半个村子被德寇烧毁了，学校炸坏了，马和公牛没有了，拖拉机被捣毁了——集体农庄遭到了致命的损失；但是，他们用他们的劳动来重新建设这一切！在这里告诉了我们，在战争时期，苏联后方乡村里的人们是怎样地凭着高度的自觉工作的，妇女们担负着和前线的红军同样重的担子；告诉了我们，苏联人民是怎样从艰苦中获得胜利，建设着他们的祖国。萧洛霍夫歌颂着，苏联数百万在各部门中不住手地劳动过并劳动着，而为一种强有力的志望——为自己伟大的祖国而服务——所驱使的苏联人；歌颂着社会主义。
    荣膺了最光荣的社会主义劳动英雄称号的库尔斯克省集体农民马尔德诺娃在答谢褒奖时说：“我的一生，……象今天这样的欢欣愉快我还没有过。为这一切，为这一切我最衷心的感谢他——亲爱的斯大林同志。他使我的生活变得幸福而光明。我要更多更好的劳动，永不满于既得的成绩，以便回谢斯大林同志对我，对所有这些同我一样的平凡的人们之如此备至的关怀。”这是苏联人民的真诚的呼声。
    苏维埃政权存在的三十年中，苏联在斯大林的领导下，无论在战争中，无论在克服任何困难中，从来不知道失败，以从未听闻的牺牲和人民苦难的代价，赢得了反法西斯战争的最后胜利，而且正以惊人的神奇的速度治愈战争的创伤，进行新的建设；然而美帝国主义却在战争中寻找自己的救星，企图以侵略感情去灌注自己的人民，以荒谬毒辣的宣传在人民中烧起“夺取世界”的野心，他们千方百计地竭力激起对苏联的仇视和憎恨，因此，作者在文首就警觉地说：新的法西斯还活着，“还在不吝啬地支出亿万美元制造原子炸弹，准备新的可怕的战争，让我们对他们的不共戴天的仇恨也活着吧！它到一定的时候是有用的！”
