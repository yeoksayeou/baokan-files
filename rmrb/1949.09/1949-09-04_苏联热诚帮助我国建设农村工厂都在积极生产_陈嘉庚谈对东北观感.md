　　The Soviet Union Enthusiastically Helps China Build Rural Factories That Are Actively Producing
　　Chen Jiageng Talks About His Impressions of the Northeast
　　[Our Newspaper News] This reporter interviewed Chen Jiageng, a well-known democratic figure from the Nanyang Chinese community, on the 2nd, after his return from a tour of Northeast China. Chen's trip to Northeast China lasted more than two months, covering more than 5,000 kilometers. He visited more than a dozen famous cities including Shenyang, Fushun, Benxi, Anshan, Dandong, Siping, Changchun, Jilin, Harbin, Qiqihar, Dalian, Lushun, and Wangyemiao. When talking about his impressions of the Northeast, Chen first expressed his admiration for the serious and sincere work ethic and open-mindedness of the responsible leaders of the Northeast Administrative Committee and provincial and municipal governments. He continued: Everywhere he went in the countryside, as a result of the land reform, the farmers were actively engaged in production, ensuring that the fields were free of weeds, which is something that cannot be seen in Nanyang. In the factories, because the workers' jobs are stable, the phenomenon of slacking off is no longer seen, and the workers are all working hard to produce. However, because the industry suffered serious damage from the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang, the repairs are costly, and coupled with a lack of management experience, the costs are relatively high. Chen said: I firmly believe that under the leadership of the People's Government, this phenomenon will be gradually resolved. Chen mentioned that during his week-long stay in Dalian and Lushun, he visited the famous glass factory and canal in the area. The glass factory is a Sino-Soviet joint venture, and the factory's labor competition has achieved gratifying results. During the Japanese occupation, the daily output was 9,000 square meters, but now the daily output has reached 20,000 square meters, and they are striving for a daily output of 30,000 square meters. At the Dalian Shipyard, the Soviet general manager invited Chen to a banquet. During the banquet, the hosts and guests raised their glasses to celebrate the health of the two great leaders of China and the Soviet Union, to celebrate the eternal friendship and cooperation between the two peoples, and to lay the foundation for world peace. The Soviet general manager also represented the factory's more than 8,000 employees and asked Chen to convey their respects to Chairman Mao when he returned to Peiping. Chen emphasized: "In the past, during the Japanese occupation, Chinese people could only be workers for a lifetime, and were not even allowed to go to important places in the factory. Now, according to the Sino-Soviet treaty, Soviet troops are stationed in Dalian and Lushun, but they do not interfere in local administration, and they treat our compatriots like brothers, helping each other, and their relationship is very good. For example, all the warehouse managers, dock managers, and section chiefs of the Dalian seaport docks are now Chinese. The factory directors and technicians of the factories affiliated with the canal are also all Chinese. They run technical training schools and night schools, and try their best to give Chinese workers the opportunity to learn technology and literacy." Chen finally said excitedly: "This time I went to the Northeast, I didn't see any beggars, and no one was gambling. Some prostitutes have reformed, and some have learned to produce, so they have gradually decreased, and some places even have none. These are all very good phenomena and are really worth learning from in all regions."

　　苏联热诚帮助我国建设农村工厂都在积极生产
  　陈嘉庚谈对东北观感
    【本报讯】记者于二日访问最近自东北参观归来之著名南洋华侨民主人士陈嘉庚氏。陈氏此次赴东北参观，为时两月余，行程五千余公里，遍访沈阳、抚顺、本溪、鞍山、安东、四平、长春、吉林、哈尔滨、齐齐哈尔、大连、旅顺、王爷庙等十余名城。陈氏谈到他对东北的观感时，首先对于东北行政委员会及省市负责首长的认真诚恳和虚怀若谷的工作精神表示钦佩。继称：他所到之处，在农村中由于土地改革的结果，农民们积极生产，做到了田无杂草，这在南洋是看不到的。在工厂中，因为工人工作安定，偷工怠工的情况已看不到了，工人们都是努力生产的。惟因工业遭受日寇、国民党严重破坏，整修费力，加以管理经验不足，使得成本较高。陈氏说：我坚信在人民政府领导下，这种现象必能逐步解决。陈氏谈及他在大连、旅顺逗留的一周中，曾相继参观了该地著名的玻璃工厂和船渠。玻璃工厂为中苏合营，该厂的劳动竞赛有了可喜的成绩。日寇时代每日出品九千平方米，现在每天出品已达两万平方米，且正向日产三万平方米努力。在大连船渠，苏联总厂长曾邀陈氏赴宴，席间宾主举杯庆祝中苏两伟大领袖健康，庆祝两国人民永远亲善合作，奠定世界的和平基础。苏联总厂长并代表全厂职工八千余，要求陈氏回北平时，代向毛主席表示敬意。陈氏着重地说：“过去日寇时代，中国人只能当一辈子工人，甚至连工厂重要的地方也不准去。现在根据中苏条约，苏联军队驻在大连、旅顺，但他们没有干涉地方的行政，而且和我同胞如兄弟相处，互相帮忙，感情是很好的。例如大连海港的码头现在所有货仓仓长、码头长、科长都是中国人负担，船渠所属各厂的厂长和技师也全是中国人了。他们办技术训练学校，还办夜学，尽量给中国工友有学习技术及识字的机会。”陈氏最后兴奋地说：“此次去东北，没有看到乞丐，也没有人赌博，娼妓有的已从良，有的已学习生产，所以已逐渐减少，有些地方甚至没有了。这些都是很好的现象，实在值得各地区学习。”
