[This City News] The Beijing People's Court made a judgment on the case of Ren Wenrui reporting a bad element being accused of making a false accusation on the 14th. The verdict: Defendant Ren Wenrui truthfully reported the illegal activities of Shen Yingtang, a suspected special agent, and should be commended. Plaintiff Zhang Suqing (Shen Yingtang's wife) accused Ren Wenrui of making a false accusation, which is inconsistent with the facts and should issue a public apology in the newspaper. Shen Yingtang is the manager of the Ailin Department Store in this city and also managed Tang Di, a puppet councilor and Kuomintang secret agent. He associated with many Kuomintang puppet military officers and officials. He once organized a Military Friends Association on the upper floor of the Ailin store, chaired by Shen Yingtang. The members who came and went were extremely complex, and there were often guns stored in the store. After the Public Security Bureau learned of this situation, they went to investigate. After Ren Wenrui and other shop assistants truthfully reported the situation, Shen Yingtang was arrested. Zhang Suqing then filed a complaint with the Municipal People's Court accusing Ren Wenrui and others of making false accusations. After the People's Court summoned the defendant Ren Wenrui to court to confess, it was confirmed that the Military Friends Association had indeed been established on the second floor, chaired by Shen Yingtang, who colluded with puppet agency personnel, including his cousin Tang Di, a Kuomintang secret agent. The Public Security Bureau often sent people to investigate in the past, so he truthfully reported the past situation. After investigation by the Municipal People's Court, the case was found to be true. The court believed that Ren Wenrui did not make a false accusation and should be declared innocent. His truthful report to the government of Shen Yingtang's illegal activities should be commended. Zhang Suqing made a false accusation out of spite and should apologize to the victim in the newspaper.

　  任文瑞应受表扬
　  张素卿挟怨诬告法院判登报道歉
    【本市讯】北平市人民法院于前（十四）日对任文瑞举发坏分子被控为诬告一案已经判决。宣判：被告任文瑞据实报告特务嫌疑犯沈应棠不法行为，应受表扬。原告张素卿（沈应棠之妻）指控任文瑞为诬告，与事实不符，应登报道歉。沈应棠系本市爱林百货商店经理，兼理唐棣是伪参议员及军统特务分子，结交国民党伪军佐官吏甚多，曾于爱林商店楼上组织军友联谊社，由沈应棠主持，来往分子极为复杂，并时有枪支存放该店内。公安局得此情况后，即前往调查，经该店伙友任文瑞等据实报告，遂将沈应棠逮捕。张素卿乃向市人民法院状诉任文瑞等诬告。经人民法院传讯被告任文瑞到庭供认，该号二楼上确曾成立过军友联谊社，由沈应棠主持，勾结伪机关人员中有其表兄军统特务分子唐棣。公安局前时常常派人前往调查，遂据实将过去情形报告。此案经市人民法院调查结果属实，认为任文瑞并非诬告，自应宣判无罪，其据实向政府报告沈应棠不法行为应受表扬，张素卿挟怨诬告，应登报向被害人道歉。
