Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 11th: TASS, Moscow: The "Izvestia" newspaper published an article on the 9th by Pilibchuk, titled "Bulgaria's National Day," stating that five years ago, Bulgaria, which had been under the rule of a royal fascist regime and served as a tool of German imperialism in the Balkans for thirty years, began a new era of free, independent, and democratic development. Under the leadership of the working class and its vanguard, the Communist Party, the working people of Bulgaria have achieved remarkable accomplishments in these five years. Following the nationalization of industry and land reform, agricultural cooperatives began to develop in rural areas. In 1948, Bulgaria's industrial production had already exceeded pre-war levels by 75 percent, and the production of means of production had increased by one and a half times compared to pre-war levels. During Bulgaria's first two-year economic plan in 1947 and 1948, several new railways, factories, and power stations were constructed, and new industrial centers such as Dimitrovgrad are being established.

Bulgaria embarked on its first five-year plan in 1949, aiming to lay a socialist foundation in industry and agriculture. Within these five years, the production of machinery, equipment, and transportation vehicles will increase by 4.8 times compared to 1948, and by 64 times compared to 1939. The output of coal, iron, lead, and other metals will increase several-fold. In agriculture, it is stipulated that crop yields should increase by 62 percent compared to pre-war levels, and livestock breeding by 44 percent. This surge in agricultural production will be the result of an increase in the number of agricultural cooperatives, which will encompass 60 percent of the basic farming population by the end of the five-year plan. To date, there are 1,594 agricultural cooperatives with approximately 150,000 members; the machines of 86 machine and tractor stations are working on the farmers' land. The living standards of the Bulgarian working people have significantly improved, as evidenced by wage increases and better supplies.

The article continues: Thanks to the fraternal and selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, the Bulgarian people have achieved these remarkable accomplishments. The Soviet Union supplies machine tools, helps mechanize mines and build power stations, and provides tractors for agriculture. The Soviet Union also provides Bulgaria with grain and industrial raw materials, and increasingly provides economic and financial, scientific and technological assistance. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Bulgarian working people have absorbed the very rich experience of Soviet socialist construction and applied it extensively. Cooperation between the Soviet Union and Bulgaria is based on the principles of complete equality and mutual respect for national sovereignty, pursuing goals that are entirely beneficial to the development and prosperity of both countries and the improvement of the welfare of the Bulgarian people.

The Soviet Union has consistently defended the rights of the Bulgarian people, national independence, national sovereignty, and the integrity of Bulgarian territory. It is worth recalling that during the preparation of the peace treaties in 1946 and 1947, the representatives of the British and American blocs and their Greek agents put forward demands to partition Bulgarian territory and demand huge amounts of compensation. At that time, the Soviet Union declared its support for the interests of the Bulgarian people and stopped the imperialists' conspiracies. The post-war Soviet-Bulgarian mutual assistance treaty further guarantees the friendship between the peoples of the Soviet Union and Bulgaria. At the same time, the fraternal and friendly relations between Bulgaria and other people's democratic countries such as Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, and Albania are also growing stronger.

Now, Bulgaria is an important factor for peace in the Balkans. As is well known, the fascists Tito and Tsaldaris, carrying out the tasks of their masters, are eager to turn the Balkans into a breeding ground for turmoil and a "powder keg of Europe" once again. Loyal to proletarian internationalism and friendship with the Soviet Union, the Bulgarian people stand at the forefront of the struggle for peace, thwarting the conspiracies of warmongers. The success of the People's Democratic Bulgaria has strengthened the forces of peace and democracy.

### 向社会主义迈进　保国生产大增　消息报著论庆祝

　　向社会主义迈进
　  保国生产大增
　  消息报著论庆祝
    【新华社北平十一日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：消息报九日刊登皮利卜楚克的题为“保加利亚人民的国庆日”的论文称：五年前，曾经在皇室法西斯统治下充当德国帝国主义在巴尔干的工具达三十年之久的保加利亚，开始了自由独立和民主发展的新纪元。在工人阶级及其先锋队共产党领导之下，保加利亚劳动人民在这五年内获得了卓越的成就。工业国有化，土地改革之后，接着农业合作社就在农村开始发展了。在一九四八年，保国的工业生产就已超过了战前水平百分之七十五，生产工具的生产则较战前增加一倍半。在一九四七年和一九四八年间，保加利亚进行第一个两年经济计划的时候，若干新的铁路、工厂和电力站就已建设起来，新的工业中心如季米特洛夫格勒等正建立起来。
    保加利亚在一九四九年着手进行第一个五年计划，要在工业和农业上奠定社会主义的基础。在这五年内，机器设备与运输工具的生产要较一九四八年增加四点八倍，较一九三九年增加六十四倍。煤和铁、铅及其他金属的产量将增加数倍。在农业方面，规定作物的产量要比战前增加百分之六十二，牲畜繁殖数百分之四十四。农业生产方面的这种高涨将是农业合作社数目增加的结果，到五年计划终了时，农业合作社将包括百分之六十的基本农民群众。到现在为止，已有一千五百九十四个农业合作社，拥有十五万左右的社员；八十六个机器与拖拉机站的机器在农民的土地上工作着。保加利亚劳动人民的生活水平业已有了显著的提高，工资的增加和较好的供应就证明了这一点。
    该文继称：由于苏联兄弟般的大公无私的帮助，保国人民赢得了这些卓越的成就。苏联供给工作母机，帮助矿坑机械化和增建电力站，并在农业上供给拖拉机。苏联还同时供给保国以谷物和工业原料，并越来越大地给予经济和财政、科学和技术方面的帮助。保加利亚劳动人民在共产党领导下吸取了苏联社会主义建设的非常丰富的经验，并加以广泛的运用。苏联与保加利亚之间的合作是基于完全平等和互相尊重国家主权的原则，追求着完全有利于两国的发展和繁荣与保加利亚人民福利之提高的目的。
    苏联一贯地保卫保加利亚人民的权利、民族独立、国家主权和保加利亚领土的完整，值得追忆的是在一九四六年及一九四七年准备和约的时候，英美集团的代表及其希腊的代理人曾提出分割保加利亚领土和索取巨额赔偿的要求。那时，苏联便声言维护保加利亚人民的利益，并制止了帝国主义者的阴谋。战后苏保互助条约更保证了苏保两国人民的友谊。同时，保国与波、捷、匈、罗、阿等人民民主国家之间的兄弟友好关系也在日益增强中。
    现在，保加利亚乃是巴尔干和平的重要因素。如众所周知的，法西斯分子铁托和曹达利斯执行他们主子的任务，亟欲把巴尔干再度变成动乱的策源地，变成“欧洲的火药库”，忠实于无产阶级国际主义和对苏联友谊的保加利亚人民，屹立在和平斗士的前列，阻止战争贩子的阴谋。人民民主的保加利亚底成功，加强了和平与民主的力量。
