　　Guiding the Machine Manufacturing Industry
　  The Industry and Commerce Bureau Continues to Hold Symposiums
    [This City News] In order to strengthen guidance over the production of private industries, the Industry and Commerce Bureau yesterday (the 12th) continued to convene a symposium of manufacturers of weaving machines, sock knitting machines, iron shovels, and large cart axles to understand the current production and sales situation of these four industries for planned production guidance. Due to overproduction, hand-powered looms and sock knitting machines are selling poorly, and some factories have even dismantled their inventory of hand-powered looms to sell the parts. However, both types of machines are suitable for developing sideline industries in rural areas. Manufacturers in these two industries hope that the government will organize production and establish contact with rural areas, so that production can be planned according to market needs. Fumin, Dachang and other factories manufacture large cart axles, using scrap iron, selling each for only 25,000 yuan, which is seven times cheaper than those made of wrought iron, and the quality is very strong, so supply cannot meet demand. Sales of iron shovels are seasonal, with spring being the most prosperous and the current period being the off-season. All manufacturers are paying attention to improving production technology. They all hope to hold more symposiums to exchange experiences, study how to improve quality, and reduce costs. The Industry and Commerce Bureau will study specific production guidance plans based on these situations and in conjunction with relevant agencies such as trade companies and the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives.

　　指导机器制造工业
　  工商局续召开座谈会
    【本市讯】工商局为加强对私营工业生产的指导，昨（十二）日续召集制造织布机、织袜机、铁锹、大车轴四种品类的机器工业厂商举行座谈，以了解该四业目前产销情况作有计划的生产指导。人力织布机和织袜机现因生产过剩，销路不好，有的厂子甚至把人力织布机存货拆了卖零件。但这两种机器都适合农村发展副业的需要，该两业厂商希望政府组织生产和农村取得联系，有计划地按照市场需要来生产。制造大车轴的有福民、大昌等厂。采用碎铁制造，每个只售二万五千元，比用元铁制造的便宜七倍，品质也很坚固，所以供不应求。铁锹的销路有季节性，以春季最畅旺，目前是淡季。各厂商对改进生产技术都很注意，他们一致希望多开座谈会，交换经验，研究提高品质，减低成本。工商局将根据这些情况和贸易公司、供销合作总社等有关机关研究具体指导生产计划。
