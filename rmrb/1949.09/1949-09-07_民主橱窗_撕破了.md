　　The "Democratic Showcase" Torn Apart
    Shu Han
    Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong Dispatch
    As the Liberation War approached nationwide victory and Guangzhou, separated from Hong Kong by a strip of water, was about to see the dawn, the British imperialists' oppression of Hong Kong residents and hostility towards the new China became more and more blatant.

    In the past, some people gave Hong Kong a name, calling it a "democratic showcase." As the name suggests, the so-called democracy here was just a kind of decoration. This meant that in Hong Kong, a few democratic newspapers and periodicals could still be published, and some progressive people who had suffered persecution by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits could still live there temporarily. But now, that showcase has openly hung up pictures of fascism.

    Beginning in October of last year, the Hong Kong colonial government passed a series of reactionary decrees, including the "Public Order Ordinance" restoring the wartime powers of the "Governor of Hong Kong," a bill specifically designed to prohibit workers' strikes, and the "Societies Registration Ordinance" specifically designed to control the activities of various organizations, and so on. Not long ago, the British army in Hong Kong increased to more than 10,000, deploying defenses and conducting exercises in the New Territories of Kowloon, creating a tense atmosphere of war. Following this was a series of wartime measures, such as requisitioning houses, household registration, restricting the export of rubber and cotton (i.e., prohibiting imports into the Liberated Areas), expanding police powers, and searching and arresting Chinese residents, or deporting them, without legal procedures. As a result, Hong Kong has become more and more openly a fascist world of terror.

    Under these reactionary decrees, the freedom and rights of the Chinese people in Hong Kong have been violated and even completely deprived. The expulsion of writer Zhou Gangming is one example. Mr. Zhou was the head of the Hong Kong branch of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles. That day, the Hong Kong special service agency – the Political Department of the Police Headquarters – asked him to go there. After asking him some irrelevant questions, the British special agent chief told him: "I have bad news for you. The Governor of Hong Kong has issued a warrant asking you to leave Hong Kong within a week." When Mr. Zhou asked for an explanation of the reasons for his expulsion and protested, the special agents replied that, according to a "law," as long as the information they obtained indicated that someone's behavior was harmful to Hong Kong's so-called "public security," they could be expelled without the person's defense or counter-evidence. They also grinned and said that this was "polite," allowing him to leave freely, otherwise he could be arrested immediately and deported. This writer was thus expelled from Hong Kong after being subjected to insults such as being photographed and fingerprinted at the special agent agency. A social science worker named Ma Te was expelled around the same time. The "Societies Registration Ordinance" contains a provision that any organization, including political parties, that has not registered in accordance with this bill is deemed non-existent; but if it is later discovered that a person was originally a member of this organization and appears in Hong Kong, the colonial government can ban it. The ordinance also stipulates that any gathering of five or more people must be reported to the police station ten days in advance, otherwise it is illegal and can be arrested. People say that the saying that Hong Kong has become a police world is completely true.

    Let's talk about the so-called freedom of speech. Although several democratic newspapers and periodicals are still being published, the restrictions and threats they face are increasing day by day. British-run newspapers can use considerable space every day to fabricate rumors and slander the new China, but when Chinese-run democratic newspapers and periodicals reveal a bit of the truth about Britain and Hong Kong, the colonial government always takes various means to retaliate, either by summoning the person in charge of the newspaper and threatening them in person, or by clamoring through its own newspapers. Once, when several democratic newspapers published a Xinhua News Agency commentary on the Four Foreign Ministers Conference, the colonial government's mouthpiece published a text that was neither news nor commentary, threatening to take action and close the newspapers. Not long ago, after the Hong Kong branch of Xinhua News Agency published the General Headquarters' commentary on the "Amethyst" incident, British imperialism went a step further and directly warned the Hong Kong branch of Xinhua News Agency in writing, saying: Hong Kong allows "freedom of speech," but this "freedom" should not be "abused." That commentary was detrimental to British interests, so it was not allowed. It turns out that Hong Kong's "freedom of speech" is only limited to "freedom" within the scope of adapting to the interests of British imperialism.

    Not only that, but the Hong Kong government is openly destroying the education of the Chinese people, especially the education of workers' children, forcing workers' children to drop out of school or accept the enslavement education of British imperialism. The Workers' Children's School was founded by the Workers' Education Promotion Association. With the support of trade unions and some enthusiastic people from the community, its achievements are excellent, and it provides learning opportunities for many workers' children who cannot afford to go to school, and has always been praised by the vast majority of residents. However, this has been envied by the colonial rulers. In May, they wanted to forcibly take over it, which aroused widespread opposition in the community, and progressive public opinion also criticized it. Recently, the Workers' Children's School was finally closed under violent suppression. There is also a fishermen's school run by the fishermen themselves, which has also been oppressed, and its board of directors has been dissolved. This reactionary behavior of destroying education began with the closure of the famous Dat Tat College, and has now expanded to all aspects. Not long ago, the colonial government promulgated a very strict condition for school equipment. On the surface, it is very grand, as if it is for the sake of students, but the actual effect is to try to seize all the schools into the hands of imperialism, directly manage them, and implement enslavement education.

    However, no matter how the British imperialists in Hong Kong take various hard or deceptive means to oppress their compatriots in Hong Kong, the compatriots in Hong Kong love their motherland even more because of the victory of the People's Liberation War. When the news that the People's Liberation Army had destroyed four British ships that had invaded China's inland rivers to help the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in the battle of the southern expedition reached Hong Kong, whether on the bus, on the road, in the tea house, or in public places, every Chinese person was talking about it with great interest, and everyone's face was full of brilliance. Even some people who had been deceived by the reactionary propaganda and therefore had deep prejudices against the Communist Party said about this incident: No matter how bad the Communist Party is, this incident is still a heroic action.

    The "democratic showcase" has been torn apart, but the people's awakening is increasing day by day.

　　“民主橱窗”撕破了
    舒翰
    新华社香港通讯
    在解放战争接近全国胜利，与香港一水之隔的广州即将黎明的时候，英帝国主义对香港居民的压迫，对新中国的敌视，一天比一天地露骨了。
    过去有人替香港题了一个名字，叫做“民主的橱窗”。顾名思义，这里的所谓民主，只是一种装饰。这就是：在香港，还有几种民主的报刊能够出版，一些遭受蒋匪迫害而流亡的进步人士，也还能在那儿暂时住一下。但是现在呢，那个橱窗里却已公开挂上一幅幅法西斯的画像。
    去年十月开始，香港的殖民地政府就通过了一连串反动法令，其中有恢复“港督”战时权力“公共秩序条例”，有专为禁止工人罢工而设的法案，有专为控制各种团体活动的“社团登记条例”等等。不久以前，英军在香港增加到一万以上，在九龙的新界一带布置防御，进行演习，造成紧张的战争空气。跟着而来的，就是一连串的战时措施，如象征用房屋，户口登记，限制橡胶、棉花出口（即禁止输入解放区），扩大警察权力，不经法律手续即可搜查与逮捕中国居民，或加以驱逐。于是，香港越来越公开地变成了法西斯恐怖世界。
    在这些反动法令下，在港的中国人民的自由权利被侵害以至被完全剥夺。作家周钢鸣的被逐，是一个例子。周先生是中华全国文艺协会香港分会的负责人，那天，香港的特务机关——警察总署政治部找他去，问了些无关紧要的话之后，英国特务头目就对他说：“告诉你一个不好的消息，港督下了手谕，请你在一个星期内离开香港。”当周先生要求说明驱逐他的理由并提出抗议时，特务们的回答是：根据一项“法律”规定，只要他们得到的情报，认为某个人的行为有妨害香港的所谓“治安”时，不需要本人申辩和提出反证，即可驱逐出境的。他们还狞笑着说，这是“客气”的，容许自由离开，否则可以即行逮捕，押出境外。这位作家就这样在特务机关遭受了照相、盖指印等侮辱之后，被驱逐出了香港。差不多时间被驱逐的，还有一位社会科学工作者马特。在“社团登记条例”里，有这么一条规定：没有按照这个法案去登记的任何团体，包括政党在内，就认为它不存在了；但以后如果发现一个人，他原是这个团体的一分子，在香港出现，那些殖民地政府就可加以取缔。该条例又有一条规定，凡有五人以上的集会，必须在十天前报告警察局，否则就是非法，发现时就可以逮捕。人们说，香港已成为警察世界这句话，是完全符合事实的。
    再说所谓言论自由这回事吧。虽然几家民主报刊还在出版，但它们所受到的限制和威胁一天天增加。英国人办的报纸，可以每天用相当的篇幅，对于新中国造谣污蔑，但当中国人办的民主报刊透露一点英国与香港的真相时，殖民地政府总要采取各种各样的手段来报复，不是传讯报刊的负责人给以当面威胁，就是通过它自己的报纸，大肆叫嚣。有一次，几家民主报纸刊载了新华社一篇关于四外长会议的评论，殖民地政府的机关报即发表了一段既非消息也不象评论的文字，恫吓着要采取行动，封闭报纸。不久以前，新华社香港分社发表了总社对英舰“紫石英号”逃跑事件的评论后，英帝国主义的做法又进了一步，直接由官方书面警告新华社香港分社，里面说：香港允许“言论自由”，但是这种“自由”不应“滥用”，那篇评论对英国的利益是妨害的，因此不允许这样做。原来香港的“言论自由”，仅仅是限于适应英帝国主义利益范围内的“自由”。
    不但如此，香港政府正公开地摧残中国人民的教育，特别是劳工子弟教育，迫使工人子弟失学或接受英帝国主义的奴化教育。劳工子弟学校是劳工教育促进会创办的，由于工会及一些社会热心人士的支持，成绩优良，对于许许多多无力上学的工人子弟，给以学习的机会，素来得到绝大多数居民的赞美。可是这就遭了殖民地统治者的忌，五月间，即要强迫接收过去，这事引起了社会上普遍的反对，进步的舆论也群起抨击。最近，劳工子弟学校终于在暴力压制下被封闭了。还有一所渔民自己办的渔民学校，同样遭受压迫，它的校董会被解散了。这种摧残教育的反动行为，以封闭著名的达德学院开始，现在扩大至各个方面了。殖民地政府不久以前曾颁布过一个非常严格的学校设备条件，表面上是非常堂皇，好象是为学生着想，而实际的作用，就是企图把所有的学校夺取到帝国主义的手里来，直接管理，实施奴化教育。
    但是，尽管英帝国主义在香港怎样采取各种各样强硬的或欺骗的手段，来压迫香港的同胞，香港同胞却因为人民解放战争的胜利对于祖国是更加热爱了。当解放军渡江南征时击毁了侵入中国内河帮助蒋匪作战的四艘英舰这一消息传到香港时，无论在车上，在马路上，在茶馆里，在公共场所，没有一个中国人不是津津有味地谈论这件事，每个人的脸上都充满着光辉。甚至一些被反动派的欺骗宣传所蒙蔽，因而对共产党抱很深的成见的人，对于这件事也都说：不管共产党怎样不好，这件事情总是一个英雄的行动。
    “民主的橱窗”撕破了，人民的觉悟却日益提高了。
