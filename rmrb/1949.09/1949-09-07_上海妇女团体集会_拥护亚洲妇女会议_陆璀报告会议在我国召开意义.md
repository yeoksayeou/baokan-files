Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 6th: Shanghai News: The preparatory committee of the Shanghai Democratic Women's Federation convened an enlarged meeting of representatives from all sectors of women on August 24th to support the upcoming Asian Women's Conference to be held in China. Representatives from 236 women's groups, totaling over 1,100 people, attended. At the meeting, Lu Cui, the China-based secretary of the Women's International Democratic Federation and Deputy Director of the International Work Department of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, reported on the general situation of the Women's International Democratic Federation's work and the significance of holding the Asian Women's Conference in China. She first explained that the task of the Women's International Democratic Federation is to organize women from all countries around the world to oppose the remnants of fascist forces, oppose new wars of aggression, strive for lasting world peace and people's democracy, defend women's rights, protect children's welfare, and strengthen the friendship and unity of women worldwide. Over the past three years, the Women's International Democratic Federation has expanded to 57 countries with 81 million members, becoming a banner of solidarity and struggle for democratic women worldwide. The purpose of convening the Asian Women's Conference this time is to enable women from Asian countries to exchange experiences in struggle, help each other, and further advance the struggle of oppressed women in Asia. At the same time, through this conference, the struggle of Asian women will be more closely linked to the struggle of women worldwide. The victory of the Chinese revolution has enhanced the international status of Chinese women, which is why the Asian Women's Conference decided to be held in China. Therefore, it has also increased the international responsibility that Chinese women should bear. She said: Chinese women must strive to learn from their Soviet sisters in order to achieve their own thorough liberation. At the same time, they must care for the women of Asian colonial and semi-colonial countries with the spirit of internationalism, share the suffering of women of oppressed nations around the world, support their struggles, and unite closely with democratic women of the world to fight for national independence, lasting world peace, and the liberation of women worldwide.

  　陆璀报告会议在我国召开意义
    【新华社北平六日电】上海讯：上海民主妇女联合会筹备会为拥护即将在中国召开的亚洲妇女会议，特于八月二十四日召开各界妇女代表扩大会。到妇女团体二百三十六个单位代表一千一百余人。会上，国际民主妇联总会中国驻会书记、中华全国民主妇联国际工作部副部长陆璀报告国际妇联工作概况及亚洲妇女会议在中国召开的意义。她首先说明国际民主妇联的任务是组织全世界各国妇女反对法西斯残余势力，反对新侵略战争，争取世界持久的和平与人民民主，保卫妇女权利，保护儿童福利，加强全世界妇女的友谊团结。三年来国际妇联已扩大到五十七国八千一百万会员，成为全世界民主妇女团结斗争的旗帜。此次召开亚洲妇女会议的目的是在于使亚洲各国妇女能够交换斗争经验，互相帮助，使亚洲被压迫妇女的斗争更向前推进一步。同时通过这个会议，使亚洲妇女的斗争和全世界妇女的斗争更加密切的联系起来。中国革命的胜利提高了中国妇女的国际地位，这就是为什么亚洲妇女会议决定在中国召开的原因。因此，也就加重了中国妇女在国际上应负的责任。她说：中国妇女要努力向苏联姊妹学习，以求得自身的澈底解放，同时又要以国际主义的精神关心亚洲殖民地与半殖民地国家的妇女，和全世界被压迫民族妇女的痛苦，支援他们的斗争，并且和世界的民主妇女紧密团结起来为各民族的独立、世界的持久和平、和全世界的妇女解放而斗争。
