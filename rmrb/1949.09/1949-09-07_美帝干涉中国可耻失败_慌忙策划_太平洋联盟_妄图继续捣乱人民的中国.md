Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 6th. After suffering a disastrous defeat in its interference in Chinese affairs, the U.S. government is frantically colluding with reactionary forces such as Britain to plan a so-called Pacific anti-communist alliance, vainly attempting to continue disrupting the People's China and opposing the people's movements throughout the Far East. Many reports indicate that the U.S. and Britain will discuss the issue of a so-called "unified policy" towards the Far East at the Tripartite Financial Conference in Washington on the 7th – a conference primarily convened to address the increasingly severe economic situation in the capitalist world. According to a Reuter's dispatch on August 25th, quoting Washington officials, "Acheson and Bevin will undoubtedly review the entire Far Eastern situation." Bevin, when departing from London for the U.S. on August 31st, stated: "We will not be limited to discussing narrow financial and trade issues, but will discuss the security of the entire world." The British Foreign Office openly acknowledged on August 30th that Dennis, the Under-Secretary of the British Foreign Office responsible for Far Eastern affairs, would fly to the United States on September 6th to participate in "strategic talks" parallel to the Tripartite Financial Conference.

In the Far East, the U.S. and Britain have also intensified their behind-the-scenes activities recently. U.S. Undersecretary of the Army Voorhees flew to Tokyo on August 29th to begin secret talks with MacArthur. The U.S. Congressional investigation team headed by Huber has also departed for the Far East for a forty-day "trip" to "study the necessity and appropriateness of a Pacific pact similar to the North Atlantic Treaty" (Reuter's). Meanwhile, after the secret Southwest Pacific defense conference held by Britain, Australia, and New Zealand in Melbourne from August 22nd to 27th, British High Commissioner for Southeast Asia MacDonald arrived in Japan from Singapore on September 3rd. According to the British Daily Mail, MacDonald will discuss anti-communist measures in the Far East with MacArthur. United Press quoted Tokyo observers as saying that one of MacDonald's tasks in Japan is to "explore militarily the extent to which U.S. forces in the Far East can prevent communist expansion outside of China." Under these circumstances, the followers of U.S. and British imperialism in the Far East are also clamoring for the speedy organization of a "Southeast Asia Anti-Communist Alliance." After exclaiming about a "major crisis in Southeast Asia" on August 30th, Thai fascist ruler Luang Phibunsongkhram said that Thailand is eager to convene a conference of anti-communist groups in Southeast Asia. Filipino representative to the United Nations Romulo, after meeting with U.S. Ambassador to the Philippines Cowen and Quirino, flew to Washington on August 29th and is currently discussing the Pacific anti-communist alliance at Lake Success with representatives of reactionary governments from Far Eastern countries. Indian reactionary government leader Nehru is planning to visit the U.S. in October. The notorious American reactionary magazine "Life Magazine" even openly put forward the hope of U.S. imperialism in an editorial on August 22nd, "In the next historical stage, Nehru can leap to become the Chiang Kai-shek of India."

The frantic activities of U.S. and British imperialism and their followers reflect their fear of the powerful national liberation movements in Eastern countries. This fear is constantly revealed in their words, and "the situation is serious" and "the crisis is significant" have become the mantras of these reactionary rulers.

　　美帝干涉中国可耻失败 　慌忙策划“太平洋联盟”
   妄图继续捣乱人民的中国
    【新华社北平六日电】美国政府在干涉中国事务中遭受惨败后，正慌忙地勾结英国等反动派，策划所谓太平洋反共联盟，妄图继续捣乱人民的中国，并反对整个远东的人民运动。许多消息透露，美英两国将于七日在华盛顿开始的三国金融会议上——这个会议主要是为了应付资本主义世界愈益严重的经济形势而召开的——讨论所谓对远东的“统一政策”问题。据美联社八月二十五日一则电讯中引华府负责人士说：“无疑的，艾奇逊与贝文将检讨整个远东情势。”贝文于八月三十一日自伦敦启程赴美时发表谈话：“我们将不限于讨论狭隘的财政、贸易问题，而是就整个世界的安全来讨论”。英外交部八月三十日更公开承认，英外部负责远东事务的次长丹宁，将于九月六日飞往美国，参加与三国金融会议平行的“战略会谈”。
    在远东方面，美英两国最近也加紧了幕后活动。美陆军部次长伍利斯已于八月二十九日飞抵东京，开始与麦克阿瑟作秘密会谈。以胡勃为首的美国会调查小组，又已动身前来远东作四十天的“旅行”，“研讨类似北大西洋公约的太平洋公约的需要性与适当性问题”（美联社）。同时，在英、澳、新西兰三国于八月二十二至二十七在墨尔本举行了西南太平洋秘密防务会议之后，英国驻东南亚高级专员麦克唐纳又于九月三日自新加坡到达日本。据英国每日邮报说，麦克唐纳将与麦克阿瑟讨论远东的反共措施。合众社引东京观察家的话，麦克唐纳赴日任务之一，便是“在军事上探悉远东美军在中国以外可以阻止共产党扩进的程度”。在这种情况下，美英帝国主义在远东的追随者，也在跟着叫喊尽速组织“东南亚反共联盟”。泰国法西斯统治者銮披汶八月三十日在惊呼“东南亚重大危机”之后说：泰国急于召集东南亚的反共集团会议。菲律宾驻联合国的代表罗慕洛，在偕同美驻菲大使柯温与季里诺会谈之后，已于八月二十九日飞抵华盛顿，现正在成功湖与远东各国反动政府代表讨论太平洋反共联盟。印度反动政府首脑尼赫鲁现正拟于十月间访美。臭名远扬的美国反动杂志“生活杂志”竟于八月二十二日社论中公然提出美帝国主义的希望，“在下一历史阶段内，尼赫鲁可以一跃而成为印度的蒋介石”。
    美英帝国主义及其追随者手忙脚乱的活动，反映出他们对于东方各国强大的民族解放运动的恐惧，这种恐惧随时流露于他们的言谈之中，“情势严重”和“危机重大”已经成为这些反动统治者的口头禅。
