Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 12th—The Hunan Military Region Headquarters and Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, in order to stabilize social order and establish people's armed forces, issued an order to reorganize local armed forces throughout Hunan Province. The order pointed out that since the People's Liberation Army entered Hunan, the armed forces led by local organizations affiliated with the Chinese Communist Party, and self-defense forces spontaneously organized by the people to resist grain requisition, resist conscription, protect factories, and protect mines, have resisted the Chiang Kai-shek-Bai Chongxi bandit troops, protected transportation, and coordinated with our main forces in military operations, achieving considerable results. However, the titles and organizational structures are inconsistent. Moreover, a small number of special agents, bandits, and lawless elements have taken the opportunity to organize armed forces under false pretenses or self-proclaimed titles, disrupting social order, endangering the interests of the people, and acting as accomplices for the enemy. Therefore, they must be reorganized or suppressed accordingly. The order stated: All armed forces and armed organizations within Hunan Province that have not been formally commissioned by the Military Region Headquarters should cease expansion from the date of the order and quickly compile a roster of personnel, weapons, ammunition, and organizational structure, attaching supporting documents, and submit it to the local military sub-district or local People's Liberation Army division-level headquarters or county people's government for forwarding to the Military Region to await formal titles and reorganization. All armed forces and their leaders who organize under self-proclaimed or false titles should immediately cease activities and quickly compile a roster of personnel, weapons, ammunition, and organizational structure, and send personnel to report and register with the local county people's government and military sub-district or People's Liberation Army division-level headquarters, abide by the law, and obey orders. The Military Region will grant lenient treatment. Those who have rendered meritorious service to the people will be appropriately rewarded. Those who persist in their errors, continue to plunder the people's property, and commit evil deeds will be severely punished without leniency. In already liberated areas, all armed forces that have not been commissioned and reorganized by this headquarters or military and political organs above the People's Liberation Army division level should immediately cease activities. All required grain and funds must be reported to the local military and political organs above the People's Liberation Army division level or the local county people's government and military sub-district for forwarding to the Military Region authorities for approval and designated location for collection. If anyone uses false pretenses to seize or borrow grain and funds without authorization, the military and political organs above the People's Liberation Army division level, local military sub-districts, and county people's governments shall strictly stop them, and the people also have the right to refuse collection. In liberated areas, without the approval of this headquarters, no one may establish armed organizations of any form under false pretenses without authorization. Violators will be punished according to law.
