　　[News from this newspaper] In supporting the production of the private Hongshun and Siwei mines, the Beijing Bank of Communications implemented the policy of developing production and taking into account both public and private interests, which strengthened the confidence of capitalist Hu Xianzhou in engaging in production. To solve the problem of sluggish sales of private coal mines' products in the summer, the bank provided a loan of 21,935,610 RMB to the private Hongshun and Siwei coal mines in Mentougou in June through a purchase order loan, ordering 7,000 tons of lump and fine coal produced by the two mines. The contract was signed on June 22, stipulating that all 7,000 tons of the ordered goods should be delivered before July 22. Later, due to flooding of the two mines during the rainy season, coupled with the long-unresolved labor-capital disputes in the two mines, production was suspended, resulting in the failure to deliver the owed coal on schedule. It was not until August 25 that they barely delivered 3,000 tons of lump and fine coal. The Bank of Communications, taking into account the difficulties of the two mines, did not immediately demand the delivery of all the owed coal according to the contract. After the labor-capital disputes in the two mines were resolved at the end of August, production was restored in early September. The bank, in implementing the policy of supporting production, did not immediately pursue the owed coal at the beginning of the two mines' resumption of production. The two parties re-negotiated to extend the time for delivery of the owed goods. The Bank of Communications allowed the two mines to deliver the owed coal in three installments one and a half months after the resumption of production (i.e., starting from October 15, one-third of the 4,000 tons of owed coal will be delivered, and another one-third will be delivered at the end of October and mid-November). It is also stipulated that before the delivery, the outstanding portion will still be calculated at a rate of six percent based on the actual goods. The two mines deeply admired the Bank of Communications' policy of both achieving the goal of developing production and complying with the principle of taking into account both public and private interests. Hu Xianzhou, the manager of the two coal mines, deeply realized the correctness of the state bank's measures to develop production, take care of the actual difficulties of private industrial and mining enterprises, and not mechanically emphasize credit. Therefore, he further strengthened his confidence in engaging in production. When the two parties signed the contract for extending the delivery period in early September, he also stated that he would definitely respond to the government's call for developing production by actively producing and repaying the owed coal on schedule.

　　照顾宏顺四维两矿实际困难
  　平市交通银行
  　准予缓期交清欠货 
    两矿经理对政府公私兼顾发展生产精神深为感佩
    【本报讯】北平交通银行扶植私营宏顺、四维两矿生产中，贯彻了发展生产，公私兼顾的方针，增强了资本家胡仙洲从事生产事业之信心。该行为解决私营煤矿夏季产品滞销问题，于六月间曾以定货贷款方式，贷予门头沟私营宏顺、四维两煤矿人民币二千一百九十三万五千六百一十元，定购两矿所产块末煤七千吨，合同于六月二十二日签定，规定于七月廿二日以前将定货七千吨全部交清。后因雨季两矿被水浸淹，复加两矿劳资纠纷久未解决，生产因而停顿，致使欠煤不能如期交付。迟至八月廿五日始勉强交付块末煤三千吨。交通银行为顾及两矿困难，当时未按契约催索应交之全部煤筋。该两矿劳资纠纷于八月底解决后至九月上旬已恢复生产。该行为贯彻扶植生产方针，并未于两矿恢复生产之初立即追索欠煤，双方复商定将交付欠货时间予以延展，交通银行允许两矿于恢复生产一个半月后再分三期交付欠煤（即由十月十五日开始交欠煤四千吨之三分之一，十月底，十一月半再各交三分之一），并规定在未交付以前拖欠部分仍按实物息六厘计算。该两矿对交通银行此种既能达到发展生产目的又符合公私兼顾原则之方针，深为感佩，该两煤矿经理胡仙洲，由此更深切认识到国家银行为发展生产照顾私营工矿实际困难，未机械强调信用之措置的正确，因而更增强其从事生产事业之信心。在九月初双方签定展期交货契约时，他并表示：一定以积极生产，如期偿还欠煤，来回答人民政府发展生产的号召。
