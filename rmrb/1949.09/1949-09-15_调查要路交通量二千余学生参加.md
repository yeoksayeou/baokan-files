　　Survey of Traffic Volume on Key Roads Involves Over Two Thousand Students

　　[Reported by this newspaper] The Municipal Urban Planning Commission, taking advantage of the opportunity of over one hundred students from Tangshan Jiaotong University participating in the summer urban data survey work, launched a city-wide traffic volume survey. Approximately two thousand two hundred people participated, surveying forty-four intersections and city gates. According to this survey, we can know which road is congested and needs to be widened or have a parallel road opened, which road should be paved with a better surface first, and which area should have more city gates opened to facilitate urban-rural traffic. On the active side, it can also be used as a basis for the city's main road system plan.

　　On September 7th, more than eighty students from Tangshan Jiaotong University conducted a trial traffic volume survey at the Xidan intersection. In this trial survey, methods and experience were created. Therefore, it was decided to mobilize a large number of middle school students to participate in the work through the Municipal Preparatory Committee of the Communist Youth League, with each person working only three hours and no transportation or meal expenses provided. Because the time was very tight, the decision was made on the 9th, and the work had to be started on the 11th. Problems such as mobilizing and organizing two thousand people and technology had to be rushed overnight. Relying on the assistance of the Youth League Committee, organizational work and study were concentrated in five districts at 3:00 pm on the 10th.

　　On the morning of the 11th, the students from Tangshan Jiaotong University departed at 4:30 am and arrived at their work locations. They did not return home until 9:30 pm, each working for eighteen hours, and fully utilizing their own experience to diligently complete the leadership tasks. The middle school students showed even greater enthusiasm. Most of the students in the first shift from 6:00 am to 9:00 am arrived before 5:30 am. Everyone persisted in their work in the rain. Some students, after finishing their shifts, still helped the liaison officers with handover and sorting work, working for eighteen hours from six in the morning, just like the liaison officers. Many shops and institutions also provided assistance, lending stools for the students to sit on and providing water for them to drink.

　　Because it rained in the morning, the traffic volume was relatively low, so it had an impact on the maximum daily traffic volume. In the afternoon, the weather cleared, and the traffic volume returned to normal. The obtained figures can still be used as a reference for the maximum traffic volume. In order to obtain more accurate and more material, the Construction Bureau plans to launch another traffic volume survey on a sunny day in the near future, and to add more intersections.

　　调查要路交通量二千余学生参加
    【本报讯】本市都市计划委员会借唐山交大一百多个同学参加暑期都市资料调查工作的机会，发动一次全市规模的交通量调查。参加工作者约两千二百人，调查路口及城门共四十四处。根据这个调查，可以知道那一条路拥挤需要展宽或开辟平行路，那一条路应该先修较好的路面，那一带应该加开城门口以便利城乡交通，积极方面更可以根据它来作全市干路系统计划。
    九月七日由八十多个交大同学在西单路口作了一次交通量的试验调查，在这次试验调查里创造了方法和经验，于是决定通过青年团市筹委会发动大量的中学同学来参加工作，每人只作三小时，不发车饭费。因为时间非常匆促，九日决定，十一日就要展开工作，两千多人的发动组织技术等问题都得连夜赶成，依靠青委会方面的协助，在十日下午三点钟分五个区集中作了组织和学习。
    十一日早晨，唐山交大同学四时半出发，到达工作地点，直至晚九点半回家，每人都工作十八个钟头，并充分的运用了他们自己的经验，努力完成了领导工作的任务。中学同学的工作热情更高，第一班晨六点至九点的同学大多数在五点半以前就到了。下雨中大家仍坚持着工作，有的同学下了班以后，仍旧帮助联络员作交班整理等工作，从早晨六点一直工作，和联络员一样地工作十八小时。有许多商店和机关亦予以帮助，借凳子给同学们坐，送水给同学们喝。
    这次工作因为上午下雨，交通量比较少，所以对全日最大交通量有影响。下午天晴，交通量恢复正常，所得数字仍可作为最大交通量的参考。为了得到更精确和更多的材料，建设局准备在最近选出一个晴天再发动一次交通量调查，并且要多增加一些路口。　　　　　　　　　　（北平市政府建设局企划室）
