Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, September 5th. The Shanghai Municipal Military Control Commission of the Chinese People's Liberation Army promulgated the "Provisional Measures for Handling Labor Disputes in Private Enterprises" on August 19th. The full text is as follows:

Article 1: These measures are formulated to reasonably handle labor disputes, with the aim of achieving mutual benefit for both labor and capital and developing production.

Article 2: The Shanghai Labor Bureau is the agency in this city for mediating and arbitrating labor disputes. Regarding all matters involving labor disputes, if direct negotiations between labor and capital fail to reach an agreement, either party may apply to the Labor Bureau for mediation or arbitration.

Article 3: The procedures for handling labor disputes must proceed according to the following steps:

	I. If daily disputes arise between labor and capital in various industries and factories, the labor and capital sides should first negotiate directly to seek a reasonable solution. The method shall be that the union, representing its workers and staff (hereinafter referred to as "employees"), directly negotiates with the capital side or legal organizations formed by the capital side.
	II. If direct negotiations between labor and capital are ineffective, both parties or either party may apply to the Labor Bureau for mediation. If mediation is ineffective, arbitration may be carried out in accordance with the law.
	III. If labor and capital, or either party, still disagree with the arbitration of the Labor Bureau, they may file a lawsuit with the People's Court of this city according to judicial procedures, and the court shall make a judgment.

Article 4: All demands made by employees of various industries and factories that need to be negotiated with the capital side must first be submitted to the Shanghai General Labor Union (or the Preparatory Committee before the General Labor Union is established) through the union of the industry or factory, or representatives of all employees, for review. If necessary, the General Labor Union may send personnel to jointly negotiate with the capital side or legal organizations formed by the capital side together with employee representatives. After an agreement is reached, both labor and capital shall jointly abide by it. If the two sides cannot reach an agreement on the dispute, either party may apply to the Labor Bureau for mediation or arbitration.

Article 5: The method of direct negotiation regarding labor disputes shall be specifically negotiated by labor and capital based on the nature and scope of the dispute. For daily disputes within the scope of one factory, representatives may be mutually dispatched by labor and capital to conduct negotiations with the factory as a unit. If the nature of the dispute belongs to the scope of the same industry, legal organizations formed by labor and capital should convene meetings separately with the industry as a unit, and elect an equal number of representatives to negotiate and resolve the matter. The number of representatives on each side shall be at least three and shall not exceed ten. The agreement reached through detailed negotiations between labor and capital shall be reported to the Labor Bureau for record. Any agreement reached by either labor or capital side using coercive means against the other party shall be invalid.

Article 6: The Labor Bureau's procedures for handling labor disputes are as follows:

	I. When labor and capital apply to the Labor Bureau to handle disputes, they should prepare an application, which should include the industry, factory name, factory address, number of people involved in the dispute, key points of the dispute, process of dispute negotiation, names of representatives and contact addresses, and other matters.
	II. After reviewing the application, the Labor Bureau shall immediately notify labor and capital to send representatives to the Labor Bureau for mediation.
	III. If mediation is ineffective, the Labor Bureau may arbitrate according to law. The arbitration decision shall be signed by the chairman of the arbitration committee and, after being approved by the director of the Labor Bureau, shall be notified to both parties for execution. If either party disagrees with the arbitration, they must notify the Labor Bureau within five days of receiving the arbitration decision and submit it to the court for handling; otherwise, the arbitration decision will have legal effect.
	IV. After a dispute occurs between labor and capital, before negotiation, mediation, and arbitration are established, both parties should maintain the original state of production. The capital side shall not have any measures such as closing the factory, suspending wages, stopping meals, or other reductions in treatment. The labor side shall not have any actions such as slowdowns or other actions that hinder production and disrupt labor discipline. However, after the Labor Bureau's arbitration is determined, even if one party needs to file a lawsuit with the court, both parties should comply with the arbitration decision before the court makes a judgment.

Article 7: The Labor Dispute Arbitration Committee established by the Labor Bureau shall be chaired by the Director or Deputy Director of the Labor Bureau or their designated representative, and shall be composed of representatives from the Municipal Government Industry and Commerce Bureau, representatives from the Municipal General Labor Union, and representatives from legal organizations formed by industrialists and businessmen in this city. The detailed rules for the organization of the Arbitration Committee shall be separately stipulated by the Labor Bureau.

Article 8: If the capital side truly needs to change its business or reduce production due to significant difficulties in production conditions, it must report to the Municipal Government Industry and Commerce Bureau for approval. After approval, the capital side has the right to reasonably dismiss workers. If the union believes that the capital side's dismissal of employees is unreasonable, it has the right to protest. If the capital side does not accept the protest, it may be submitted to the Labor Bureau for resolution through mediation or arbitration.

Article 9: These measures shall be implemented from the date of promulgation.

Article 10: The right to interpret and modify these measures belongs to the Municipal Military Control Commission during the military control period, and to the Municipal People's Government after the end of the military control period.
