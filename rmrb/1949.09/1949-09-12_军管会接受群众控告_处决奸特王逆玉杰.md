　　Military Control Commission Accepts Mass Accusations
　　Executes Traitor Wang Yujie
　　[Report from this city] Wang Yujie, the great traitor and special agent who murdered thousands of workers in the Changxindian area, was sentenced to death by the Military Tribunal of the Military Control Commission in Changxindian on the 10th, and executed publicly, following requests and accusations from the worker masses. The masses were overjoyed.

　　The special agent Wang Yujie, known as "Living Yama," served the Japanese invaders during the occupation of North China, cruelly harming his compatriots. In 1942, the criminal served as a police officer and plainclothes detective in the Changxindian Police Section. Because of his loyalty to the enemy and puppet regime, he was awarded certificates and bonuses four times by the enemy and puppet authorities, and was promoted to police officer in April 1945. Under the command of the Japanese special agent Da Pu and others, the criminal personally tortured and murdered workers on false charges of "secret communication with the Eighth Route Army," "ideological impropriety," and "theft of public property." Workers sent to the Shijiazhuang concentration camp at his instigation, where they suffered the enemy and puppet regime's tortures and died, included Ma Xiang, Zhai Xiangyun, Wei Yongzhong, Wang Huanzhang, Bai Dehai, Fu Jun, and the peddler Li Yonggui. Workers sent to Japan to be enslaved by the enemy included Tan Fu, Li Shunlu, Sun Shanting, Chen Junming, Sun Jingwen, and Li Wenyu. Except for Li Wenyu, who luckily survived, all others died in Japan due to the unbearable persecution of the Japanese invaders. Workers sent to Manchukuo to be used by the Japanese and puppet regime included Sun Dexiang, Bai Jinsheng, Liang Hongkui, Niu Gui, Liu Sen, Wang Zhong, Zhang Zhengang, Fan Qiming, Li Yuxiang, Zhang Xuejian, and Liu Xiaoer. Except for a small number who risked their lives to escape en route and survived, the whereabouts of the rest are unknown. After the Japanese invaders surrendered, the criminal defected to the Kuomintang reactionaries' Fengtai 3rd Tank Regiment and became a secret agent, continuing to act as a tool of oppression. The masses suffered grievances and were filled with deep-seated hatred but had nowhere to appeal. Only after the liberation of Beiping did the families of the deceased and the victims lodge accusations with the Municipal Public Security Bureau, with as many as 24 written complaints. The bureau accepted the just demands of the masses and arrested Wang Yujie on April 12. During the interrogation, the criminal resorted to various sophistries, downplaying his crimes and showing no intention of confessing.

　　The entire workforce of Changxindian was extremely angered by this heinous public enemy, Wang Yujie, and unanimously demanded that the Military Tribunal of the Military Control Commission sentence him to death in the area. The Military Tribunal of the Military Control Commission held a court session there yesterday. At that time, the courtroom and the surrounding area were packed with more than 4,000 worker representatives and members of the public. Workers Liang Chengxun, Ma Fu, Li Wenyu, Guo Jiade, and students from Fulun Elementary School, Zhang Fengying and Gong Xiulan, all spoke with extremely heavy hearts, accusing the criminal of his monstrous crimes in court. Liang Peixun, an elderly worker in his sixties, sobbed as he recounted how the criminal had brutally beaten his son, Liang Hongkui, before sending him to Japan to be enslaved by the enemy. He concluded, "We are indeed fortunate; without the Communist Party, we would not have this day!" Gong Xiulan, a thirteen-year-old elementary school student, choked with emotion as she accused Wang Yujie of torturing her father, Gong Lianzong. Guo Jiade, a representative of the South Factory workers, shouted in an angry voice, "We workers demand that the People's Government sentence Wang Yujie to the ultimate penalty in court to avenge the dead and injured workers!" At the same time, he called on the workers to actively support the front lines and completely eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries. When Wang Feiran, Director of the Military Tribunal, announced the death sentence for the special agent Wang Yujie, all the workers present raised their arms and shouted, "Support the fair verdict of the court!" "Support the People's Government that protects the people!" "Raise vigilance, report special agents, and protect factories and railways!" "Long live the Chinese Communist Party!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" The masses crowded in the plaza outside the courtroom also shouted, "Execute the special agent Wang Yujie!" After Wang Yujie was executed, workers and the masses rushed to the execution ground like a flood. They wanted to see for themselves how Wang Yujie, who had caused them more than a decade of bloody hatred, was brought to justice under the protection of the people's interests by the People's Government.

　　军管会接受群众控告
　  处决奸特王逆玉杰
    【本市讯】在长辛店一带杀害过成千成百工人的大汉奸大特务王玉杰，经工人群众的要求和控诉，已于十日由军管会军法处在长辛店判处死刑，当众处决。群众无不称快。
    特务王玉杰人称“活阎王”，早在华北沦陷时，即曾供日寇驱使，残害同胞。三十一年时，该犯充当长辛店警务段警务手和司法便衣，因效忠敌伪，曾由敌伪发给四次奖状及奖金，并于三十四年四月提升为警务员。该犯在日特大蒲等指挥下，以“私通八路军”，“思想不良”及“窃盗公物”等名义，亲自非刑屠杀工友，由他主使送往石家庄集中营受尽敌伪酷刑而死的工人有马翔、翟湘云、韦永忠、王焕章、白德海、傅钧及小贩李永贵等。送往日本供敌奴役的工人有谭福、李顺录、孙善亭、陈俊明、孙景文、李文友等，除李文友幸得生还外，余均因不堪日寇迫害，死于日本。送至伪满供日伪驱使的工人有孙德祥、白金声、梁洪魁、牛贵、刘森、王仲、张振刚、范启明、李玉祥、张学俭、刘小二等，除一小部分于途中冒死逃脱得生还外，余均下落不明。日寇投降后，该犯又投靠国民党反动派丰台战车三团，充当谍报特务，继续为虎作伥。群众含冤受害，仇深如海，无处申诉。直到北平解放后，死难工人家属及受害的工人和群众，才纷纷向市公安局提出控诉，单书面控诉状即达二十四件之多。该局接受了群众正义要求，于四月十二日将王玉杰逮捕。在审讯中，该犯多方狡辩，避重就轻，毫无认罪之意。
    长辛店的全体工人，对此罪大恶极的公敌王玉杰，愤怒已达极点，一致要求军管会军法处到该地判处死刑。军管会军法处乃于昨日在该地开庭，当时法庭内外，挤满了四千多工人代表和群众。工人梁承训、马富、李文郁、郭家德，扶轮小学学生张凤英、龚秀兰等，在法庭上均以极沉痛的心情，控诉该犯的滔天罪行。六十多岁的老工友梁培训在控诉该犯以非刑将他的儿子梁洪魁毒打之后，送往日本供敌奴役时，痛哭失声。最后他说：“还是我们有德，要不是来了共产党，我们那有今天呀！”十三岁的小学生龚秀兰控诉王玉杰如何拷打他父亲龚连宗时，呜咽不能成声。南厂工友代表郭家德以愤怒的声音大声喊出：“我们工人要求人民政府当庭对王玉杰判处极刑，为死难和受害的工友报仇雪恨！”同时他号召工友们积极生产支前，彻底消灭蒋介石反动派。当军法处王斐然处长宣布判处特务王玉杰死刑时，全体到庭工人一致振臂高呼：“拥护法庭的合理判决！”“拥护保护人民的人民政府！”“提高警觉性，检举特务，保护工厂铁路！”“中国共产党万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”等口号。拥挤在法庭外广场上的群众，亦喊出：“枪决特务王玉杰！”当王玉杰被执行死刑之后，工友和群众象洪流一般的奔向刑场，他们要亲眼看一看，和他们有过十多年的血海深仇的王玉杰，在人民政府保护人民的利益下是怎样的伏了法。
