　　汉口金银首饰业
  　大部自动转业
  　古玩珠宝业亦纷纷改行
    【汉口讯】本市金银首饰业解放后先后自动转业。根据市政府工商局八月份调查结果，金银首饰业原有会员一○二家，转业者已有九五家，房屋租让歇业者二家。其改业种类繁多：如民权路老凤祥益记转营印刷业，汉正街老宝成盛记改营面粉业，大智路一六号老宝兴永记改营宝兴五金号。转业的性质为书店、文具、印刷、钢笔、寄售店、茶叶庄、香烟、肥皂、面粉、酱油、油盐场、杂货店、山货纸张、西法洗染、米厂、橡胶商店、电器厂等十六行业，其中香烟店占一八家，寄售店九家，茶叶庄七家等。本市其他奢侈品行业象保华街梵宫、复兴街淳化阁、交通路品珍等九家古玩珠宝店，因生意萧条，亦纷纷转向其他业务，改变营业方向，从事有利国计民生的商业。
