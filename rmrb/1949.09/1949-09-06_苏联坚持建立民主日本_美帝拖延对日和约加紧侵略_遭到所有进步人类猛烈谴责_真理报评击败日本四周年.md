Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 5th: TASS Moscow dispatch: On the 3rd, the Soviet *Pravda* published an article by Mayevsky entitled "The United States Obstructs the Democratization of Japan" to commemorate the fourth anniversary of the defeat of Imperialist Japan.

The author said: The complete destruction of Hitler's war machine by the heroic Soviet Army also tolled the death knell for the Japanese militarists. However, Japan still possessed powerful war industry bases in Northeast China and Korea. The one million-strong Japanese Kwantung Army was the main striking force. It is well known that the Anglo-American Pacific Command had stipulated that a landing operation on the Japanese mainland would not be carried out until the summer of 1946.

The Soviet Union's declaration of war against Imperialist Japan was prompted by the lofty efforts of the Soviet people to end World War II. The rapid and astonishing offensives carried out by the heroic Soviet Army in Northeast China and Korea, and the defeat of the Japanese Kwantung Army, led to the complete collapse of Japan. The Soviet Union played a decisive role in eradicating the hotbeds of aggression in the West and the East.

Referring to post-war policy toward Japan, the author said: The policy of the Soviet Union is based on the Potsdam Declaration of July 26, 1945. The declaration stipulated the following plan: to eliminate Japanese militarism, to implement the democratization of Japan, to transform Japan into a peace-loving and democratic country, and to prevent Japan from engaging in aggression in the Far East again. The Soviet government fully abides by this declaration, insisting on abolishing Japan's war industry, establishing international control, and not allowing the revival of Japanese aggression. On the other hand, the Soviet Union supports the development of Japan's peaceful industry to meet the interests of the Japanese people.

The author declared: The uncooperative policy pursued by the United States in the Far Eastern Commission and the Allied Council for Japan, and the attempt to indefinitely delay the conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan, are constituent parts of the overall aggressive policy pursued by U.S. imperialism. The United States blatantly violates its international obligations, transforming the plan to eliminate militarism and democratize Japan into a plan to rebuild Japanese militarism and turn Japan into a U.S. military strategic bridgehead against the Soviet Union and the national liberation movements in Asian countries.

The author continued: The policy implemented by the U.S. ruling clique in Japan is fully manifested in the so-called "Japanese economic recovery and stabilization" plan adopted by the U.S. government at the end of last year without notifying and exceeding the Far Eastern Commission. The implementation of the "stabilization" plan has intensified the enslavement of Japan by U.S. monopoly capitalists in close contact with Japanese financial groups.

The author continued: The policy pursued by the U.S. imperialists, which seeks to revive the hotbed of aggression in the Far East and threaten the peace and security of the people, has been fiercely condemned by all progressive humanity.

The Soviet Union, which played a major role in defeating Hitler's Germany and Imperialist Japan, stands at the forefront of the powerful movement for peace and democracy. For the peace and security of the whole world and the Far East, the great socialist country is fighting for the establishment of a democratic, peace-loving Japan.

### 苏联坚持建立民主日本  美帝拖延对日和约加紧侵略　遭到所有进步人类猛烈谴责  真理报评击败日本四周年

　　苏联坚持建立民主日本
    美帝拖延对日和约加紧侵略
    遭到所有进步人类猛烈谴责
    真理报评击败日本四周年
    【新华社北平五日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：三日，苏联真理报登载马耶夫斯基所撰“美国阻挠日本民主化”一文，以纪念击败帝国主义日本四周年。
    作者说：苏联英勇陆军的完全击毁希特勒战争机器，同时也敲响了日本军阀的丧钟。然而，日本在中国东北及朝鲜仍拥有强大的战争工业基地。一百万日本关东军，是主要的冲击力量。众所周知，英美太平洋司令部曾规定在一九四六年夏季才对日本本岛进行登陆作战。
    苏联对帝国主义日本的宣战，是由于苏联人民为了结束第二次世界大战而作的高尚努力所促成的。英勇的苏联陆军在中国东北及朝鲜进行的迅速而惊人的攻势，以及日本关东军的溃败，导向日本的全部崩溃。在铲除西方及东方的侵略温床方面，苏联发挥了决定性的作用。
    论及战后对日政策时，作者说：苏联的政策系根据一九四五年七月二十六日的波茨坦宣言。该宣言规定了如下的方案，即肃清日本军国主义，实行日本的民主化，把日本变为一个爱好和平的民主国家，并使日本再不能在远东从事侵略。苏联政府完全信守这个宣言，坚持废除日本战争工业，建立国际管制，不容许日本侵略的复活。另一方面，苏联赞成日本和平工业的发展，以符合日本人民的利益。
    作者宣称：美国在远东委员会及盟国对日委员会上所执行的不合作政策，以及企图无定期延宕缔结对日和约，是美帝国主义所执行的总侵略方针的一个构成部分。美国明目张胆地违反其所负的国际义务，把肃清军国主义与民主化的方案，变换为重建日本军国主义，并把日本变为反对苏联和亚洲各国民族解放运动的美国军事战略桥头阵地的方案。
    作者继称：日境美国统治集团所执行的政策，充分表现在美国政府去年底在没有通知而且超越远东委员会的情况下所采取的所谓“日本经济复兴及稳定”计划。“稳定”计划施行的结果，加紧了美国垄断资本家在与日本财阀密切联系之下对日本的奴役。
    作者继称：美帝国主义者所执行的希图使远东的侵略温床复活并威胁人民的和平与安全的政策，受到所有进步人类的猛烈谴责。
    在击溃希特勒德国和帝国主义日本上曾起主要作用的苏联，站在和平与民主的强大运动的前列。为了全世界及远东的和平与安全，伟大的社会主义国家正在为建立民主的、爱好和平的日本而斗争。
