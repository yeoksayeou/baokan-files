　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 18th. A Polish News Agency dispatch from New York on the 17th reports: A celebration of the 30th anniversary of the American Communist Party was held in Madison Square here, attended by 20,000 people. The slogans of the celebration were: Fight against the growth of American fascism, fight for international peace and democracy, and fight for the rights of workers and the people at home. American Communist Party General Secretary Dennis said at the meeting: Regardless of the outcome of the trial of the twelve in New York, the American Communist Party will continue to fight for the realization of socialism in the United States. The recent persecution suffered by the Communists has only increased the will to fight for peace and democracy in the United States; this is evidenced by the widespread response to the Trade Union Support for Peace Conference scheduled to be held in Chicago in October. He said: "We Communists swear on the honor of the working class: We will block the path of imperialism, fascism, and the war camp. To those who hope to declare our party illegal, we say: 'This road is impassable.' Regardless of all difficulties, we will lead our class and our country to victory."

　　纽约麦迪逊广场盛大集会
  　庆祝美共三十周年
    美共总书记以工人阶级荣誉宣誓将堵塞帝国主义及战争阵营道路
    【新华社北平十八日电】波兰通讯社十七日纽约讯，美国共产党三十周年纪念庆祝会，在此间麦迪逊广场举行，参加者达两万人。纪念会的口号是：为反对美国法西斯主义的增长而斗争，为国际和平与民主而斗争，为国内的工人权利及人民权利而斗争。美国共产党总书记但尼斯在会上说：不论在纽约举行的十二人审讯的结果怎样，美国共产党将继续为争取社会主义在美国的实现而斗争。最近共产党人所遭受的迫害，仅仅增加了为争取美国国内和平与民主而斗争的意志；这一点可由定于十月间在芝加哥召开的职工会拥护和平会议一事所引起的广泛响应获得证明。他说：“我们共产党人以工人阶级的荣誉宣誓：我们将堵塞帝国主义、法西斯主义及战争阵营的道路。对那些希望宣布我们的党为非法的人们，我们说：‘此路不通’。不顾一切困难，我们将领导着我们的阶级及我们的国家走向胜利。”
