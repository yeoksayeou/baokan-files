Regarding the Issue of Real Value Savings
Reply from the Savings Department of the People's Bank of Beiping to Readers

Editor:
　　I have a few questions that are not very clear. Please answer them for me:
　　1. I don't understand the meaning of the "Real Value Savings Rate" published daily in the newspaper. How is it calculated, and based on which commodities?
　　2. Will Real Value Savings still be affected by price fluctuations?
　　3. Where is the bank located? Does it have any agencies in the Western District?
　　4. I would like to make a deposit. What are the procedures?

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Ma Lingbo
Mr. Ma Lingbo:
　　The Savings Department of the Beiping Branch of the People's Bank answers your questions regarding Real Value Savings in the order they were listed:
　　1. The Real Value Savings offered by our department uses the "Standard Commodity Unit" as the calculation standard. Each unit includes one "jin" (approximately 500g) of wheat flour, one "jin" of corn flour, and one "chi" (approximately 1/3 meter) of Five-Blessings Cloth. The total price of these three items is calculated based on the sum of the daily published wholesale market prices of these three commodities in the People's Daily for the previous five days, averaged out. The total price of these three items calculated in this way is posted daily as the Real Value Savings Unit Rate.
　　2. The deposit and withdrawal of Real Value Savings are both based on commodity units. The unit rate changes at any time according to the rise and fall of commodity prices. When depositors make a deposit, the currency to be deposited is converted into units and deposited. When the deposit matures, it is converted back into currency at the then-current rate for payment. Therefore, even in the event of rising prices, depositors can still enjoy the benefit of preserving the real value of their deposits and will not be affected by price fluctuations.
　　3. The address of our department is No. 27, West River Embankment, Qianmenwai, specializing in Real Value Savings. In addition, the branch offices and sub-branch offices established by our branch in various cities of this municipality, as well as the office in Tong County, also handle this business on our behalf.
　　4. The following four types of Real Value Savings are temporarily available: 1. Lump-sum Deposit and Lump-sum Withdrawal; 2. Deposit Principal with Interest Payment; 3. Regular Small Deposits and Lump-sum Withdrawal; 4. Lump-sum Deposit and Regular Small Withdrawals. The specific procedures for making a deposit are as follows: When opening an account, the depositor must first fill out a "Real Value Savings Deposit Account Opening Application Form," select the type of deposit, and fill in the account name, occupation, address, and other items. If the depositor wishes to withdraw the funds with a simple slip, a pre-reserved seal must be provided for verification. Then, the depositor pays the amount due to the cashier's office according to the number of units they wish to deposit. Our department enters the amount into the account book and issues a deposit certificate or passbook. The procedure is then complete (please refer to the Provisional Regulations for Real Value Fixed-Term Savings Deposits).

### 有关折实储蓄问题　北平人民银行储蓄部答读者

　　有关折实储蓄问题
  　北平人民银行储蓄部答读者编者先生：鄙人有几件事不甚清楚，请您解答一下：
    一、每日报载之“折实储蓄牌价”不知作何解释，是按照何种实物计算出来的？
    二、折实储蓄能否再受物价波动影响？
    三、该行地址在何处？西城有无代理处？
    四、余欲储蓄不知有何手续？
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　马凌波马凌波先生：你所询有关折实储蓄各点，承人民银行北平分行储蓄部按原列次序分别解答如下：
    一、本部所办之折实储蓄是用“标准实物单位”做计算标准。每个单位包括通粉一市斤、玉米面一市斤和五福布一市尺。三种东西的总价计算的方法是根据前五天人民日报按日公布的这三种实物市场批发价格的总和平均计算；这样算出来的三种物品的总价，每天挂牌公布就是折实储蓄单位牌价。
    二、折实储蓄存款的存付都是以实物单位做为计算的基础，而单位的牌价则是随着实物价格的升降而随时变化。储户存款时把要存的货币折成单位存入，到期支付时又按当时牌价折成货币付出。所以虽然在物价上涨的情形下，储户的存款依然可以得到实物保本的好处，不致受物价波动的影响。
    三、本部地址在前外西河沿二十七号专办折实储蓄。此外本分行在本市各城所设的办事处、分理处等分支机构以及通县的办事处也都代办此项业务。
    四、折实储蓄暂时举办以下四种：１整存整付，２存本付息，３零存整付，４整存零付。存款的具体手续，就是开户时先由存户填具“折实储蓄存款开户申请书”，选定存款种类，填明户名、职业、住址等项，如愿凭草支取者并须预留印鉴以凭验付，然后照自己要存的单位数到出纳部分缴清应缴的款项，本部记入帐册，开给存单或存摺，手续即告完毕（可参阅折实定期储蓄存款暂行章程）。
