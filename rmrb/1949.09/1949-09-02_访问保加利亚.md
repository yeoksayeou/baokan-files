　　Visiting Bulgaria
    By Saslavsky, Translated by Zhang Erchangjie
    A solid road, like a spiral, winds its way along the dizzying edge of a cliff, up the Trojan Pass. This mountain pass is built on a mountain over a thousand meters high, surrounded by undulating mountains that stretch from central Bulgaria to the northern border with the Danube River. There are also many mountains to the south, but they are not very high. Bulgaria is like a strong fortress behind a stone wall. From ancient times, many conquerors, enemies of the Bulgarian people, invaded through the Balkans. For example, the Trojan Pass is named after its conqueror, Trojan, an ancient Roman emperor who left many historical sites. Even now, ancient Roman relics of granite and marble can be found in many places. The Turkish emperors also oppressed the Bulgarian people.
    These mountains are all places of historical significance. Standing on the Trojan Pass, we can see Mount Ura to the right south, where the Bulgarian hero Hristo Botev resisted the Turkish army and died (1876)! This great warrior, with the help of the Russian people, brought Chernyshevsky's ideals to his motherland; even now, the memory of him is a glorious symbol of Soviet-Bulgarian friendship. We can also see to the left, the forested Shipka Pass area, where the bravery and loyalty of Russian soldiers once shocked the world, as they defeated the Turks for the freedom of their Slavic brothers.
    We followed the Rhodope mountain road, passing through many small towns and villages, and everywhere we went, we were delighted to see the new social life emerging. We saw new industries being built. On the way, we passed a city hidden in the mountains, which was the construction site of a new Bulgarian electricity project. We received a warm welcome. The women all wore smiles, and the Young Pioneers – here they are called "Children of December" – also excitedly told us about their studies in school. When passing through the Muslim areas of Bulgaria, we often saw church spires piercing the sky, relics of the Turkish feudal era. But there were also new things here. They have overcome the old traditions in struggle. For example, in addition to mosques, we also saw Turkish teenagers working in factories, sharing a part of the construction work with Bulgarian teenagers. Turkish teachers also gave lectures on "Botev's Influence on Turkish Youth" to commemorate this hero. This was something that did not exist in ancient times.
    After the Turks were defeated, the treacherous and cruel Prince Ferdinand ruled Bulgaria. He paved the way for German capitalists and spies to invade, allowing Germany to build the Berlin-Baghdad railway through central Bulgaria. From then on, the Balkans became the "powder keg of Europe." British and French capitalist forces also invaded, and Bulgarian capitalists sold out their country to serve them. But the imperialist countries finally failed. In December 1944, the Soviet army liberated Bulgaria and also liberated the Balkans. This is why the Bulgarians call the young generation "Children of December." The fate of the Bulgarian bourgeoisie was the same as that of imperialism, and it was also defeated. The Bulgarians handed over power to those who had fought for the freedom and independence of the country for decades, embodying the will of Hristo Botev – the Communists led by Georgi Dimitrov.
    We traveled through the new Bulgaria to a new city, Dimitrovgrad, an industrial city built by young people, where the new Bulgarian working class is being trained. At the Panik best Dimitrov mine, old and young miners, gathered in the shade to ask us about the latest achievements of the Soviet coal mining industry. They were most concerned about the production situation in the Donets Basin – the famous Moscow coal-producing area.
    Boniskin visited Panik himself last year, and explained many new production methods. This was the first time Bulgarian workers had seen a Soviet innovator, which left a deep impression on the Bulgarian workers. Boniskin's method was simply applied to Panik, because although the nature of the coal seams was different, the Bulgarian workers began to use new machines to adapt to his special conditions. The workers learned to think, create, and overcome difficulties. Bulgaria's Boniskin schools have trained many outstanding workers and innovators, the most famous of whom is Stolov.
    Before the victory of the Bulgarian people, the production situation of its coal mining industry was the opposite. The coal mines were owned by capitalists, who rarely cared about mechanized production methods and only knew how to exploit labor to increase their income. Only now that the people have begun to love their motherland, can coal production exceed the level of 1948. In the Five-Year Plan, production in 1953 will be more than three times that of the pre-war period.
    We not only answered questions about Soviet coal production, and machinery and working conditions. They also asked about Soviet literature, movies, and new theatrical works.
    We saw young people in blue coats everywhere on the way, they belong to the engineering troops who are building new roads and power stations. We have personally seen that the whole of Bulgaria is undergoing a creative development process, and is busy with construction and learning work. Socialist sentiment has spread to all industrial and enterprise sectors.
    In Sofia, we had the opportunity to participate in the Bulgarian National Production Conference. The meeting place was filled with leaders of the Bulgarian working class, who were discussing the work summary of the movement to improve worker morale, and also evaluating the results of the honorary flag awards. At the meeting, we met the male and female worker leaders who completed Bulgaria's first Five-Year Plan. The pre-war industrial level has been raised, and the results are amazing.
    They attach great importance to the recovery of agriculture, which was damaged during the war. Under the leadership of the working class, Bulgarian farmers have increased their self-confidence and ability. Although there are still many weaknesses left over from the past, the enemies of socialism still want to capitalize on this historically longer tendency of private property. However, tractor stations have been established in large numbers, poor and middle peasants have great confidence in the help of the Communist Party, and cooperative farms are gradually increasing. It is estimated that there will be 1,909 cooperative farms in 1909, and there are already 1,535.
    Bulgaria's path to socialism is complicated. The difficult task of building a strong industry and restoring agriculture according to the new plan remains to be completed. The defeated bourgeoisie still has obstructive power, but the whole of Bulgaria shows a new atmosphere. In the dormitories of young workers, many places are engraved with the motto: "We are building, we must be vigilant!"
    This is the slogan of the new Bulgaria!

### 访问保加利亚

　　访问保加利亚
    萨斯拉夫斯基著  张耳常节译
    一条坚固的路，象螺旋一样沿着高得使人晕眩的悬岩边，向特罗金山道盘旋上去。这条山道修筑在一千多米高的山上，四面被起伏的群山环绕着，这些山脉从保加利亚中部伸展到北边和多瑙河流域的国境去。南方也有很多山，但并不十分高。保加利亚就象在一座石墙后面的坚固的堡垒中一样。从古代，就有许多征服者，保加利亚人民的仇敌，经巴尔干侵入，例如特罗金山道就因它的征服者特罗金而得名，这个古罗马的皇帝留下很多史迹，到现在，许多地方还可以发现花岗石和大理石的古罗马的遗物。土耳其皇帝也曾经压迫过保加利亚人民。
    这些山都是有历史意义的地方，站在特罗金山道上，我们可以看见在右南方的乌拉山，保加利亚的英雄克里斯多波特夫，在那儿抵抗过土耳其军队，而且战死了（一八七六年）！这个伟大的战士因为有俄国人民的援助，把薛尔尼雪夫斯基的理想带给他的祖国；直到现在，人们对他的怀念，还是苏保人民友谊的光荣的象征。我们还可以看见左边的，有森林的希比加山道一带地方，在那儿，俄国兵的勇敢和忠实，曾惊动过全世界，他们曾为斯拉夫兄弟民族的自由战败了土耳其。
    我们沿着罗杜布斯的山路，经过许多小镇和村庄下山了，每到一个地方，我们都因为看见新生的社会生活而欣喜。我们看见新的工业正在建设中，途中经过一座藏在群山中的城市，那是新保加利亚电力计划的建筑。我们受到热诚的招待，妇女们都面带着笑容，少年先锋队员们——这儿把他们叫做“十二月的孩子”——也兴高彩烈地告诉我们在学校中学习的情形。路过保加利亚的回教区时，我们常看见直刺着天空的教堂塔尖，这都是土耳其封建时代所遗下来的古迹，但是这儿也有新的东西，它们在斗争中已战胜了古旧的传统，例如：除了回教堂之外，我们还看见土耳其的少年也在工厂做工，他们分担了一部分保加利亚少年的建设工作，土耳其的教师们，也以“波特夫对土耳其少年的影响”为题演讲，来纪念这位英雄，这都是古代所没有的。
    土耳其被打败后，奸诈而残酷的裴迪南王子统治了保加利亚，他为德国资本家和间谍铺好了侵略的道路，让德国经过保加利亚的中部，修筑柏林到巴格达的铁路。从那时起，巴尔干就变成了“欧洲的火药库”，英国和法国的资本主义势力也侵入了，保加利亚的资本家们，出卖了祖国为他们服务。但是帝国主义国家终于失败了，一九四四年十二月，苏联军队解放了保加利亚，也解放了巴尔干，这就是保加利亚人把年青的一代叫做“十二月的孩子”的原因。保加利亚的资产阶级和帝国主义的命运一样，也被打垮了，保加利亚人把政权交给那些为祖国的自由独立战斗了数十年的，具体表现了克里斯多波特夫的遗志的人——以季米特洛夫为首的共产党人。
    我们经过新保加利亚旅行到一个新的城市季米特洛夫格勒，这是一个青年们建造的工业城市，新生的保加利亚的工人阶级在这儿受着训练。在派尼克最好的季米特洛夫矿场上，老的和少年的矿工们，在遮阴的地方围着我们询问苏联的煤矿工业最近的成绩，他们最关心波尼斯金——著名的莫斯科产煤区生产的情形。
    波尼斯金去年曾亲自访问过派尼克，而县解释了许多新的生产方法，这是保加利亚工人第一次见到苏联的改革家，给保加利亚工人留下了很深的印象。波尼斯金的方法很简单地实用于派尼克，因为煤层的性质虽然不一样，但保利加亚工人开始使用新机器适应他的特殊条件，工人们学会了思想，创造，克服了困难。保加利亚的波尼斯金学校曾训练出许多优秀的工人和改革家，其中最著名的是斯脱洛夫。
    保加利亚人民胜利以前，它的煤矿工业的生产情形是相反的，煤矿属于资本家们所占有，他们很少关心机械化的生产方法，只知道剥削劳工增加自己的收入。只有现在人民开始热爱他们的祖国的时候，煤矿生产才能超过一九四八年的水准，五年计划中，一九五三年的生产最将达战前的三倍以上。
    我们不仅解答苏联煤矿生产的问题，和机械以及工作条件的问题。他们还问起苏联文学，电影和新出的戏剧作品。
    我们在途中到处看见穿蓝外套的年青人，他们属于修筑新道路和电力站的工程部队。我们亲眼看见整个的保加利亚正经历一段富有创造性的发展过程，而且忙于建设和学习的工作。社会主义的情绪已普及于各个工业和企业部门。
    在索菲亚，我们有一个机会参加保加利亚全国的生产会议，会场里坐满了保加利亚工人阶级的领导者们，他们正在讨论提高工人情绪的运动的工作总结，同时还评判荣誉奖旗的成绩。在会上，我们遇见那些完成保加利亚第一次五年计划的男女工人领袖。战前的工业水准已提高了，成绩很惊人。
    他们很重视在战时遭受破坏的农业的恢复工作，保加利亚的农民在工人阶级的领导下，已增加了他们的自信心和能力，虽然现在仍存在着许多过去遗留下来的弱点，社会主义的敌人仍然想使这历史较长的私有财产的倾向资本主义化，但是拖拉机站已大量成立，贫农和中农已很信任共产党的帮助，合作农场渐渐增多了，据估计一九○九年将有一千五百个合作农场，现在已经有一千五百三十五所了。
    保加利亚走上社会主义的道路是复杂的，建设强大的工业和按照新计划恢复农业的困难工作，还待努力完成，被打垮的资产阶级仍有阻碍的力量，可是保加利亚全国都表现了一种新生的气象，在年青工人们的宿舍里，许多地方都刻有座右铭：“我们正在建设，我们要警惕！”
    这是新保加利亚的口号！
