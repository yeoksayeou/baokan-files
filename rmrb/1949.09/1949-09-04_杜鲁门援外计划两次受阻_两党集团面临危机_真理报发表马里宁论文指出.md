　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 1st: TASS Moscow News: The Pravda published the second part of Malinin's international commentary on August 30th, entitled "The Crisis of the American Two-Party Group".

　　Malinin wrote: The extension of the US Congressional session was the result of pressure from the White House. The White House demanded that Congress pass the President's proposed foreign aid weapons program at all costs before adjourning for vacation.

　　However, during the debate on the plan, intense struggles ensued, proving the severity of the "two-party group" crisis. In a short period, Truman has suffered two defeats in Congress. The first was during the debate on the 1950 fiscal plan for the Marshall Plan. Although the notorious Harriman and Hoffman had already notified the Marshall Plan countries of the total amount of the 1950 Marshall Plan appropriation and even allocated it to the recipient countries, the Senate, regardless of the huge pressure from the White House, still reduced this amount by 10 percent. The second failure was encountered by the President in the House of Representatives during the discussion of the foreign aid weapons program. The House of Representatives cut Truman's plan by 50 percent. And even when 187 Democrats and 51 Republicans voted in favor of the plan, which had already been cut, 122 members (94 Republicans, 27 Democrats, and 1 Labor Party member) voted against it.

　　Malinin wrote: Such a result caused the President's concern. The President appealed to past events and urged Republicans to be loyal to the "two-party group."

　　The attitude currently adopted by the Republican Party is the result of the drastic deterioration of the situation in the United States and the growing dissatisfaction of the broad masses of the American people. The US economy is on the verge of a major economic crisis. Industrial production is declining month by month. Exports are decreasing, and unemployment is increasing.

　　There is a two billion dollar deficit in the 1949 federal budget. As for the 1950 budget, the "planned" deficit is five billion dollars, and there are various reasons to believe that this number will be greatly exceeded.

　　Marshall Plan appropriations (roughly equal to the "planned" 1950 deficit) are included in the budget. This means that it will be paid for solely by taxpayers. In this situation, Truman proposed to pass a new foreign aid weapons program, thereby further expanding the budget deficit and adding new burdens to the shoulders of middle-income American taxpayers.

　　It is understandable that this policy has aroused dissatisfaction among all sectors of the American people. Republicans are now definitely trying to extract as much political capital as possible from this dissatisfaction for the 1950 congressional elections.

　　Malinin concluded: Facts have proven that the "two-party group" does indeed face a crisis, and the Republicans believe that it is more beneficial for them to depart from the path of "two-party" consensus than to share the responsibility for the failure and bankruptcy of the "two-party group."

### 杜鲁门援外计划两次受阻　两党集团面临危机　真理报发表马里宁论文指出

　　杜鲁门援外计划两次受阻
  　两党集团面临危机
  　真理报发表马里宁论文指出
    【新华社北平一日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报八月三十日刊登马里宁国际评述的第二部分，题为“美国两党集团的危机”。
    马里宁写道：美国国会会期的延长是由于白宫施行压力的结果。白宫要求国会在休会渡假以前不顾一切通过总统所提出的武器援外计划。
    但是在辩论计划期间，紧张斗争却接踵而至，证明“两党集团”危机的严重性。在短短时间内，杜鲁门已在国会中遭到两次失败。第一次是辩论马歇尔计划一九五○年度财政方案时。虽然丑名昭彰的哈里曼与霍夫曼已将一九五○年度马歇尔计划拨款的总额通知马歇尔计划各国，甚至已批给各受援国，但参院仍不顾白宫的巨大压力，将这一数目削减百分之十。第二次失败是总统在众院讨论武器援外计划时遇到的。众院将杜鲁门的计划削减百分之五十。而且甚至在一百八十七名民主党人和五十一名共和党人投票赞成这一计划时，还有一百二十二名议员（九十四名共和党人，二十七名民主党人及一名劳工党人）投票反对这一已经经过削减的计划。
    马里宁写道：这样的表决结果引起总统的忧虑。总统就诉诸于不久之前的往事，敦促共和党人对“两党集团”忠心。
    共和党目前所采取的态度是美国情况剧烈恶化和美国广大人民日益不满的结果。美国经济正濒于大经济危机的边缘上。工业生产正在逐月下降。出口正在减少，失业正在增加。
    一九四九年的联邦预算中有二十亿元亏空。至于一九五○年的预算，“计划中”的亏空是五十亿美元，而且有各种根据相信这一数字将被大大地超过。
    马歇尔计划拨款（约与“计划中”的一九五○年的亏空相等）被列入预算中。这意味着，它将由纳税人单独支付。正在这样情况下，杜鲁门建议通过新的武器援外计划，从而更扩大了预算亏空，并将新的负担加到美国中等收入的纳税人肩上。
    这一政策在美国各界人民中引起不满是很可以了解的。共和党人现在肯定地正力图为了一九五○年的国会选举而从这一不满中间牟得尽可能大的政治资本。
    马里宁结语说：事实证明，“两党集团”确实存在着危机，共和党人认为比起分担“两党集团”失败与破产的责任来，离开“两党”一致的道路，是对他们更有利的。
