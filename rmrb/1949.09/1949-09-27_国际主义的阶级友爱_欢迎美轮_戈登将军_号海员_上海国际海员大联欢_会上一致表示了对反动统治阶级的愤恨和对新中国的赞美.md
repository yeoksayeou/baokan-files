　　Internationalist Class Friendship
  　Welcoming the Seamen of the American Ship "General Gordon"
    Shanghai International Seamen's Grand Gathering
    The meeting unanimously expressed their resentment towards the reactionary ruling class and their praise for New China
    【Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 25th】 The Shanghai Seamen's Union held a grand "International Seamen's Friendship Party" on the evening of the 23rd with the seamen of the American ship "General Gordon," which arrived in Shanghai that day. More than 300 Chinese and foreign seamen and guests attended. The venue was decorated with various paintings, and the ship flags of various countries were interspersed in the hall. In the center of the platform was a huge portrait of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and a huge, clear slogan "Seamen are the Pioneers of International Cooperation!" was hung. The conference began with a speech by Wang Alin, director of the Shanghai Seamen's Union. He expressed his welcome to the seamen of the "General Gordon" on behalf of all the seamen in Shanghai, and then said: "We seamen drift on the ocean for years, leaving our parents and wives, and live a very hard and monotonous and lonely life at sea all year round. When we arrive at a port, few people care about us, let alone welcome us. This is not because the seamen of various places do not care about foreign seamen brothers, do not welcome foreign seamen brothers, but because of political relations, many local governments do not want seamen brothers all over the world to have too close contact. Now that Shanghai is liberated, the Chinese people can engage in activities according to their own wishes, so we can be very excited to hold this friendship party. We hope to encourage each other, unite with each other, and continue to work hard for the happiness of all mankind in the future." Then Liu Changsheng, director of the preparatory committee of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, delivered a speech, in which he expressed his welcome to the seamen of the "General Gordon" on behalf of the federation and explained that the status of the working class in Shanghai had fundamentally changed after liberation. He excitedly continued: "Dear brothers! We are one family, we are dear brothers, we are good friends; what the Chinese working class opposes is American imperialism. The reason for opposing it is because it helped the reactionary Chiang Kai-shek to massacre the Chinese people. Our struggle against American imperialists is not only necessary for the Chinese people, but also beneficial to the American workers. Facts have proved that we Chinese workers and American workers, and even workers all over the world, have long seen this point clearly. For example, seamen and dockworkers in the United States, Canada, and Australia refused to help the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang load and transport military supplies to massacre the Chinese people. The Chinese working class has been, is, and will be friendly to American workers, and this friendship will definitely become more and more intimate. Naturally, American imperialists and the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries will continue to undermine the great unity of the world's workers, especially the workers on both sides of the Pacific. They are inciting a third world war, attempting to sacrifice our working class and preserve their reactionary ruling position through a third world war. Brothers! Let us unite more closely! Strive for greater victories for the working class of the world, and work hard to defend world peace." Then foreign seamen spoke one after another. Moon, an American seaman on the "General Gordon," said: "I used to hear many good things about the Chinese Liberated Areas, which have now been confirmed; and you are continuing to move forward for the happiness of the Chinese people." Black man Watkins said: "In the United States, we often fight against capitalists. We fight against them through newspapers, trade unions, and various other means. The reactionary ruling class uses all methods to destroy us, but our power is very strong, and we believe that the final victory will definitely belong to us." Overseas Chinese Liu Qun said in Cantonese: "In the past, we listened to the propaganda of the reactionaries and were very unclear about many things in China. Recently, I realized that this revolution in China is the greatest of all revolutions in Chinese history. After I go back, I will definitely do my best to publicize to every overseas Chinese and mobilize overseas Chinese to enthusiastically support the great Chinese revolution." Stoddard, a seaman on the "Flying Clipper," said: "I have never been to Shanghai, but in any case, I am very willing to see the people of any country liberated from autocratic tyrannical rule." Keston, a seaman on the "Independence," said: "We are very happy to come to Shanghai and see that you have overthrown Chiang Kai-shek. This is a victory for the working class in the struggle against the ruling class. Now you are independent and you have become the masters. We hope that when we come back again, we will see that you are united even more strongly." Finally, the People's Broadcasting Station Choir sang, the New An Troupe performed waist drums, and the film "Liberation of Northeast China" was shown, all of which aroused enthusiastic applause. The conference was filled with internationalist class friendship from beginning to end.

　　国际主义的阶级友爱
  　欢迎美轮“戈登将军”号海员
    上海国际海员大联欢
    会上一致表示了对反动统治阶级的愤恨和对新中国的赞美
    【新华社上海二十五日电】上海海员工会于二十三日晚与当日抵沪的美轮“戈登将军”号海员，举行了盛大的“国际海员联欢晚会”，到中外海员及来宾共三百多人。会场四周遍挂各种画幅，场中各国各色船旗交错，讲台上正中为毛主席朱总司令巨幅肖像，并悬“海员们是国际合作的先驱！”的巨幅鲜明标语。大会首由上海海员工会主任王阿林致词。他代表全上海的海员们向“戈登将军”号海员们表示欢迎之意，接着说：“我们海员成年在海洋中飘流，抛别父母和妻子，常年过着极辛劳而又极单调寂寞的海上生活。每到一个港口很少有人关怀我们，更用不到说来欢迎我们了。这倒并不是各地海员们不关心外来的海员兄弟，不欢迎外来的海员兄弟，实在是由于政治上的关系，许多当地政府不希望全世界的海员兄弟们有太密切的联系。现在上海解放了，中国人民可以依照自己的志愿从事活动，所以我们能够非常兴奋地来举行这次联欢晚会。我们希望今后彼此勉励，互相团结，为全世界人类的幸福继续努力工作。”继由上海总工会筹委会主任刘长胜致词，他代表该会表示对“戈登将军”号海员们的欢迎，并说明解放后上海工人阶级的地位已根本改变。他兴奋地接下去说：“亲爱的弟兄们！我们是一家人，我们是亲弟兄，我们是好朋友；我们中国工人阶级反对的是美帝国主义。反对它的原因，就是因为它帮助反动派蒋介石残杀中国人民。我们对美帝国主义者的斗争不只对中国人民是必须的，就是对美国工人也是有利益的。事实证明我们中国工人和美国工人，以至全世界的工人，老早看清楚了这一点。譬如美国、加拿大和澳洲的海员和码头工人就曾拒绝帮助蒋介石匪帮装运军火来屠杀中国人民。中国工人阶级过去、现在以及将来对美国工人都是友爱的，而且这种友爱一定会越来越发亲密。自然，美国帝国主义者和蒋介石反动派会继续破坏世界工人，尤其是太平洋东西两岸工人的伟大团结。他们正在煽动第三次世界大战，企图通过世界第三次大战，来牺牲我们工人阶级，保存他们的反动的统治地位。弟兄们！我们更加亲密地团结起来吧！争取世界工人阶级的更大的胜利，为保卫世界和平而努力吧。”接着外籍海员相继发言。“戈登将军”号美籍海员穆恩（ＭＯＯＮ）说：“以前听到许多中国解放区美好的事情，现在已经证实；而且你们正在为着中国人民的幸福继续前进。”黑人华特金斯（ＷＡＴＫＩＮＳ）说：“在美国，我们常常和资本家斗争，我们通过报纸、工会以及其他各种方式和他们斗争。反动的统治阶级用一切的方法来摧毁我们，但我们的力量非常强大，相信最后胜利一定属于我们。”华侨刘群用广东话说：“过去我们听了反动派的宣传，对中国许多事情很不明了。最近才明白这次中国的革命是中国历史上所有革命中最伟大的。我回去后一定尽我的力量向每一个华侨宣传，动员华侨热烈地支持中国大革命。”“飞剪”号海员司多达（ＳＴＯＤＤＡＲＤ）说：“我没有来过上海，但无论如何我是很愿意看到任何一国人民能从专制暴力统治下解放出来。”“独立”号海员凯司顿（ＫＥＳＴＯＮ）说：“我们很高兴来到上海，看到你们把蒋介石推翻了。这是工人阶级对统治阶级的斗争的胜利。现在你们是独立了，你们已做了主人。我们希望再回来的时候看到你们团结得更加坚强。”最后由人民广播电台合唱团歌唱、新安旅行团表演腰鼓，并放映“解放东北”电影，都激起了热烈的鼓掌。大会自始至终洋溢着国际主义的阶级友爱。
