Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, 26th. Following the liberation of Zhangzhou on the 19th, the People's Liberation Army on the Fujian front advanced victoriously. In the three days from the 19th to the 21st, they successively captured eight bandit strongholds on the outskirts of Xiamen, including Haicheng, Fugong, Jimei, Jiaowei, Liuwudian, Panmei, Hongtang, and Aotou, annihilating more than 4,000 enemy troops. Part of the Liberation Army advancing south along the Fuzhou-Xiamen Highway, simultaneously with the liberation of Zhangzhou, captured the Liuwudian bandit stronghold on the opposite bank of Xiamen on the evening of the 19th, annihilating a company of the 221st Regiment of the 74th Division. Subsequently, at 4:00 AM on the 20th, they captured three bridgehead fortresses on the opposite bank of Xiamen, namely Aotou, Panmei, and Hongtang, annihilating two battalions and the entire engineering battalion of the 543rd Regiment of the 55th Army. The Liberation Army that liberated Zhangzhou, overcoming various difficulties and disregarding fatigue while pursuing the fleeing bandits, at 12:00 PM on the 20th, first delivered a head-on blow to the fleeing bandits crossing the Jiulong River at Dongmei, 20 miles west of Jiaowei, annihilating more than 1,000 men from the 427th and 428th Regiments of the 143rd Division. Another group of Kuomintang bandit troops, consisting of the headquarters of the 68th Army and the headquarters of the 81st Division under its command, the 241st Regiment, the 242nd Regiment, and one regiment of the 143rd Division, totaling more than 3,000 men, fleeing towards Haicheng, were surrounded and annihilated by the pursuing troops of the Liberation Army near Shimatou, 10 miles west of Haicheng, at 5:00 AM on the 21st. More than 1,500 enemy troops, including Tang Xingbo, Chief of Staff of the 68th Army, were captured, and the remaining bandits fled in panic towards Xiamen by sea. Another unit of the Liberation Army, advancing straight down the Long River, also occupied Haicheng and Fugong, strongholds on the southwest coast of Xiamen, at 3:00 PM on the 20th, capturing more than 200 remnant bandits alive. According to the above preliminary statistics, more than 4,000 enemy troops were annihilated.

Xinhua News Agency, Central China Front, 26th. A certain unit of the Liberation Army in Southern Jiangxi completely annihilated approximately 3,000 die-hard Kuomintang bandits who stubbornly resisted in the Cuiwei Peak north of Ningdu, capturing alive the bandit leader Huang Zhenzhong, the pseudo-Eighth District Commissioner and concurrently Commander of the Security Forces, and his deputy Huang Guozhen, along with more than 800 others. A certain unit of the Liberation Army launched an attack at 6:00 AM on September 23rd, and by 8:30 AM, they had successively occupied Yixiantian, Sizishi, Cuiwei Peak, and other places. After fierce fighting until 1:30 PM on the same day, they continued to occupy Jinjingdong, Huangzhufeng, Manaofeng, Sanxianfeng, Sanduanzhai, Dazhouzhai and other strongholds. A small number of remnant bandits retreated to the last remaining stronghold, Guanyin Mountain, attempting a last-ditch struggle. The Liberation Army then surrounded them tightly, and at 4:00 PM, they once again occupied Guanyin Mountain in one fell swoop, and the remnant bandits were completely wiped out. Detailed battle results are still being verified. Cuiwei Peak has a dangerous terrain, and the mountains are covered with stone fortresses, which has always been the base of the feudal rule of the bandit gangs in Southern Jiangxi. The bandit Huang Zhenzhong has dominated Southern Jiangxi since 1930, persecuting the people and plundering property. Recently, as our army advanced south like a broken bamboo, the bandit Huang forced the people to donate money to buy guns, organize teams, and store a large amount of grain and water on Cuiwei Peak, attempting to resist stubbornly relying on the terrain. However, the People's Liberation Army only took nine and a half hours to conquer all their mountain villages one by one and completely annihilate the bandit forces. The people of Southern Jiangxi all rejoiced upon hearing the news.

　　闽南前线我军乘胜挺进
  　连克厦门外围八据点
    赣南宁都翠微峰上全歼顽匪三千
    【新华社福建前线二十六日电】福建前线人民解放军继十九日解放漳州后，乘胜挺进，于十九日至二十一日三天内，连克海澄、浮宫、集美、角尾、刘伍店、潘湄、洪塘、澳头等厦门外围匪军据点八处，歼敌四千多人。沿福厦公路南下的解放军一部，与解放漳州同时，于十九日晚攻占厦门对岸的刘伍店匪军据点，歼敌七十四师二二一团一个连。继于二十日晨四时，攻占澳头、潘湄、洪塘等厦门对岸的桥头堡垒三处，歼敌五十五军五四三团两个营暨工兵营全部。解放漳州的解放军，于追击逃匪中，克服种种困难，不顾疲劳，于二十日十二时，首由角尾西二十里之东美，迎头痛击渡过九龙江的逃匪，歼敌一四三师之四二七团、四二八团一千余人。另股向海澄方向逃窜的国民党匪军六十八军军部及所率之八十一师师部，二四一团、二四二团及一四三师的一个团共三千余人，于二十一日拂晓五时，为解放军追击部队在海澄西十里的石码头附近包围聚歼，俘敌六十八军参谋长唐星伯以下一千五百余人，余匪从海上向厦门仓惶逃逸。沿龙江直下的另部解放军，并于二十日下午三时，占领厦门西南海滨据点之海澄、浮宫，生俘残匪二百余。以上初步统计，共歼敌四千余人。
    【新华社华中前线二十六日电】赣南解放军某部全歼宁都以北翠微峰据险顽抗的国民党残匪约三千人，活捉匪首伪八区专员兼保安司令黄镇中、副司令黄国桢以下八百余人。解放军某部于九月二十三日上午六时开始发起进攻，八时半即相继占领一线天、四子石、翠微峰等地，激战至当日十三时半，续将金井洞、黄竹峰、马脑峰、三仙峰、三段寨、大州寨等据点占领。少数残匪退守最后残余据点观音山，图作垂死挣扎，解放军乃将其团团包围，迄十六时复一举占领观音山，残匪乃告全部肃清。详细战果正清查中。翠微峰山势险要，山上遍通石寨，一向为赣南匪帮封建统治的根据地。黄匪镇中自一九三○年以来即霸持赣南，残害人民，掠夺财物。近因我大军南下势如破竹，黄匪更强迫人民捐购枪支，编练团队，并在翠微峰储藏大批粮水，企图据险顽抗。但人民解放军仅以九小时半的时间，即将其所有山寨一一攻克，全歼匪部。赣南人民闻讯莫不称快。
