Ji Yue Zi No. 0625

It is hereby announced that the "Provisional Traffic Management Rules of Beiping Municipality" and the "Management Rules for the Operation of Large Vehicles in Beiping Municipality" were promulgated and implemented on September 10th. In order to maintain traffic order, ensure the safety of people's lives and property, and implement government decrees, this Bureau will begin to earnestly enforce management.

It is hoped that all vehicle owners will equip their vehicles completely as scheduled according to the regulations. Those who fail to actively improve their equipment or deliberately delay after the deadline will be dealt with according to the regulations, depending on the severity of the circumstances.
