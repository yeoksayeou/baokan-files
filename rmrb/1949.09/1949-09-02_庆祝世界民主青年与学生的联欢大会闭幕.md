　　Celebrating the Closing of the World Festival of Democratic Youth and Students

　　The World Festival of Democratic Youth and Students is a solidarity gathering of international youth fighting for peace, a powerful demonstration by the youth of all countries, united for the cause of peace and democracy and the bright future of humanity, against the reactionary camp of imperialism!

　　The appearance of the Chinese youth delegation at this World Youth Festival represents the first time that the youth of New Democracy China have gloriously participated in the international family. This opportunity was not easily obtained. It was obtained under the unprecedentedly strong conditions of the international peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, and it was obtained under the conditions that our people's liberation war has achieved a basic victory in the country. Every performance of the Chinese youth delegation in the conference has been loved and cheered by the world's youth, which precisely shows how closely the victory of the Chinese people is connected with the victory of the world's people.

　　However, the Chinese youth must not be arrogant and complacent. In the ranks of the world's youth, we must learn with an open mind. We must learn from the Soviet youth, cultivated under the earnest care of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the great Stalin. Their spirit, wisdom, culture and physical strength have been fully developed, and their morality, thought, and political outlook brilliantly show the world's youth how glorious and happy this generation in socialist countries is!

　　Listen, in every great peace demonstration, in the magnificent ranks, a common voice resonates in various languages: "Long live the mentor of all working people—the great Stalin! Glory to the fortress of peace—the Soviet Union!" This kind of emotion of loving the Soviet Union and loving the great leader Stalin comes from hatred of the evils of imperialism, and from the vision of the common bright future of mankind—communist society. This powerful call will make the warmongers of Wall Street tremble.

　　We must learn the spirit of internationalist unity and friendship represented by this World Youth Festival. Although the U.S. imperialists armed Chiang Kai-shek to the teeth to oppose our people with money, the American youth solemnly swore to stand with the Chinese youth. The U.S. imperialists can cruelly exploit the countries of Central and South America, but the American youth donate travel expenses and medicine to the youth of Puerto Rico. This powerfully tells the U.S. imperialists that its North Atlantic aggressive treaty and any similar aggressive treaties are just waste paper without the signature of the people! They will eventually be torn to pieces! French youth and Vietnamese youth, Dutch youth and Indonesian youth, all extend their hands of support to each other, promising to fight together to smash the enslavement and tyranny of imperialism!

　　We Chinese youth, through the Festival, exchange combat experience with the world's youth and learn from each other, in order to "Defend Peace, Prevent a New War!" In the future, we must accelerate our pace, march towards the remaining nests of the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries, and quickly achieve a comprehensive victory to liberate all of China; at the same time, we must more bravely and actively devote ourselves to the construction of our people's democratic country. We hope that youth and students in various places will respond to the call of the Central Committee of the New Democratic Youth League and the All-China Students' Federation, and immediately convene youth mass rallies in various places to celebrate the success of the World Youth and Student Festival, introduce the great achievements of the international youth movement, and strengthen internationalist education among the broad masses of youth across the country.

### 庆祝世界民主青年与学生的联欢大会闭幕

　　庆祝世界民主青年与学生的联欢大会闭幕
    世界民主青年与学生的联欢大会，是一个为争取和平而战斗的国际青年的团结大会，是世界各国的青年为和平、民主事业和人类美好的未来而联合一致向帝国主义的反动阵营所举行的强有力的示威！
    中国青年代表团在这次世界青年联欢大会中的出现，是代表着新民主主义的中国青年，光荣地参加到国际大家庭中的第一次。这一机会之所以得来实在是不容易的。这是在以苏联为首的国际和平民主阵营空前强大的条件下得来的，这是在我国人民解放战争在全国取得了基本胜利的条件下得来的。中国青年代表团在大会中的每一项表演受到了世界青年的热爱与欢呼，正说明了中国人民的胜利与世界人民的胜利是如何紧密地相连着的。
    但是，中国青年决不可骄傲自满，在世界青年的行列，我们必须虚心学习。学习在苏联共产党与伟大的斯大林殷切关怀下培育起来的苏联青年，他们的精神、智慧、文化和体力充分的发展了，他们的道德、思想与政治面貌，辉煌地向世界青年显示着社会主义国家的这一代是多么的光荣、幸福！
    你听，在每次和平大示威中，雄伟的行列里每一次都用各种不同的语言响着一个共同的声音：“全体劳动人民的导师——伟大的斯大林万岁！光荣归于和平的堡垒——苏联！”这一种热爱苏联热爱伟大领袖斯大林的情感，是来自对帝国主义罪恶的憎恨，来自对人类共同的美好的未来——共产主义社会的憧憬。这个强大的呼声，将使华尔街的战争贩子发抖。
    必须学习这次世界青年联欢大会所代表的国际主义的团结友爱精神。尽管美帝国主义者用金元把蒋介石武装到牙齿与我国人民为敌，但是美国青年却庄严地宣誓要和中国青年站在一起。美帝国主义者可以残酷地压榨中南美的国家，但是美国青年却向波多黎各的青年捐赠旅费和医药。这就有力地告诉美帝国主义者，它的北大西洋侵略公约以及类似的任何侵略公约，没有人民的签字，一概都是废纸！终将被撕成碎片！法国青年和越南青年、荷兰青年和印尼青年，都相互伸出支援的手，保证要共同奋斗，击碎帝国主义的奴役与暴政！
    我们中国青年借联欢大会和世界青年一起交流战斗经验，相互学习，为了“保卫和平，防止新战争！”今后更必须加快步伐，向蒋介石反动派残余的巢穴进军，迅速获致全面的胜利，解放全中国；同时要更英勇更积极地投入我们人民民主国家的各项建设事业中去。我们希望各地青年、学生，响应新民主主义青年团中央委员会和全国学联的号召，立即在各地召集青年群众大会，庆祝世界青年与学生联欢大会的成功，介绍国际青年运动的伟大成就，在全国青年群众中加强国际主义的教育。
