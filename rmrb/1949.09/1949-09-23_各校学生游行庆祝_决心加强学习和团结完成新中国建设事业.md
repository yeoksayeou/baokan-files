Students from Various Schools Parade in Celebration
    Resolved to Strengthen Learning and Unity to Complete the Construction of New China
    After reading yesterday's newspaper, students of the China University (Hua Da) stationed on campus held a celebration. At 6:00 PM, over a hundred students dressed up, danced the Yangko, and paraded with banners to celebrate. The "Celebrating the People's Political Consultative Conference Yangko Dance," for which students of the Third Division had prepared for two months, would soon be performed. The Political Research Institute convened a symposium in the evening to discuss Chairman Mao's report. The female students were especially happy. Zhao Xuying and Zhang Minghua from the First Division said, "There are sixty-eight women representatives in the People's Political Consultative Conference. Isn't that exciting?"
    The Middle School Affiliated to the Normal University immediately published a blackboard newspaper. Yesterday (the 22nd) afternoon at 4:00 PM after class, a parade of over eight hundred teachers, students, and staff quickly set off. The teachers also participated in the Yangko team. While dancing the Yangko, they shouted, "Celebrate the success of the People's Political Consultative Conference!" "Celebrate the founding of the People's Republic of China!" When the large group arrived in front of Zhongnanhai, enthusiastic applause immediately erupted from the crowd. The Yangko team danced, and a dense crowd of people surrounded them, shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the Chinese Communist Party!" The cheers lasted for a long time.
    Early in the morning of the 22nd, Peking University (Beida) students waited at the school gate to buy the People's Daily. Some even ran to Wangfujing to buy it. Many people were vying to read one copy of the newspaper, so one student recited Chairman Mao's opening address aloud. When he recited, "The Chinese, who account for one-quarter of the world's population, have stood up from now on," the students unanimously raised their hands and shouted, "The Chinese people have stood up from now on!" The reciting student read in a majestic voice, "Let those reactionaries at home and abroad tremble before us!" The students immediately shouted, "Let the American imperialists and Chiang Kai-shek tremble!" The cheers were endless.
    In the list of representatives, students excitedly pointed to the names of Peking University professors and students, saying, "Professors such as Xu Deheng, Yuan Hanqing, and Fan Hong, as well as students such as Xie Bangding and Yan Fumin, were under special agent surveillance and oppressed and warned by the reactionaries before the liberation of Beiping. Some were forced to flee to the liberated areas, but now they have all stood up." An economics student said, "These professors and students are wholeheartedly serving the people and are loved by the students. They can only stand up in a country with a people's democratic dictatorship."
    When the students of the Normal University saw that the People's Political Consultative Conference had opened and the Central People's Government was about to be established, ushering in the prelude to the new China, they were extremely happy and excited, believing that the People's Political Consultative Conference represented the voice of the entire Chinese people. They resolved to strengthen learning and unity to complete the construction of new China.
    The Catholic University (Fu Jen) Communist Party branch and the Communist Youth League General Branch framed the People's Daily with red borders and posted eight red characters "Celebrating the Inauguration of the People's Political Consultative Conference" on the dormitory wall. The students gathered around, vying to see it, and everyone showed excited smiles. The students of the faculty and department joint association and the communication group divided into four groups to visit the president and professors.

　　各校学生游行庆祝
    决心加强学习和团结完成新中国建设事业
    华大同学读到昨天报纸之后，一部留校队举行了庆祝会。午后六点钟，一百多同学化了装扭着秧歌、抬着标语上街游行庆祝。三部同学花了两个月准备时间的“庆祝人民政协大秧歌舞”很快就要演出。政治研究所在晚上召开了座谈会，讨论毛主席的报告。女同学们尤其高兴。一部赵叙英、张明华说：“人民政协中有我们妇女代表六十八名，这不令人兴奋么？”
    师大附中学生会立刻出了黑板报。昨（二十二）日下午四点课后，师生员工八百多人的游行队伍很快出发了，先生们也参加了秧歌队。一边扭着秧歌一边高呼着“庆祝人民政协成功！”“庆祝中华人民共和国成立！”大队到达中南海门前时，队伍里立刻涌起热烈的掌声，秧歌队扭起来了，行人们密密层层地围了一个大圈，大家高呼着“毛主席万岁！”“中国共产党万岁！”
    二十二日一早，北大同学们都等在校门口买人民日报，有的为此跑到王府井去买。多少人抢着一份报看不开，就由一位同学朗诵毛主席的开幕词。当朗诵到：“占人类总数四分之一的中国人从此站立起来了。”同学们一致举手高呼“中国人民从此站起来了！”朗诵同学用雄壮的声音读着：“让那些内外反动派在我们面前发抖吧！”同学们立刻高呼：“让美帝和蒋介石发抖吧！”呼声经久不息。
    在代表名单中，同学们兴奋地指着北大教授和同学的名字说：“许德珩、袁翰青、樊弘等教授、及谢邦定、晏福民等同学，在北平解放前都受着特务监视，受着反动派压迫和警告，有的被迫跑到解放区，现在都站起来了。”一位经济系同学说：“这些教授和同学都是全心全意地为人民服务，为同学所爱戴的，只有在人民民主专政的国家里才能站起来。”
    师大同学们见到人民政协开幕了，中央人民政府即将成立，揭开了新中国的序幕，都异常欢欣、兴奋，认为人民政协代表了整个中国人民的声音。决心加强学习和团结，完成新中国的建设事业。
    辅大中共支部和青年团总支部把人民日报加上红边，并且编了“庆祝人民政协揭幕”八个红字贴在宿舍的墙上。同学们围着争着看，大家都显露着兴奋的笑容。院系联合会和通讯组的同学分成四组访问校长及教授。
