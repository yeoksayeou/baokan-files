Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 24th: Upon hearing the news of the victorious opening of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the founding of the People's Republic of China via radio, the over 40,000 overseas Chinese in North Korea were overjoyed and congratulated each other. They were particularly excited about Chairman Mao's opening address at the People's Political Consultative Conference. The North Korea Overseas Chinese United General Association has notified its branches in various regions to prepare for expanded celebrations on the day of the establishment of the Central People's Government. The association also sent a congratulatory telegram to the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference on the 23rd. The telegram reads as follows: To all representatives of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference:
    The epoch-making Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference has opened in the people's capital of Beiping amidst the cheers of all Chinese people.
    The victorious opening of the conference has realized the long-cherished aspirations of the Chinese people for many years. It is the result of the Chinese people's unyielding struggle for a hundred years, especially the victorious fruit of the Chinese people's heroic struggle under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao for more than twenty years. From now on, the Chinese people will be completely free from the feudal oppression of three thousand years, the imperialist aggression of one hundred years, and the rule of bureaucratic capitalism of thirty years. From now on, under the leadership of the people's own central government, they can build a brand-new, prosperous, and advanced New Democratic New China. It will be a strong member of the world's democratic camp.
    On the occasion of the opening of this great epoch-making People's Political Consultative Conference, the more than 40,000 overseas Chinese in North Korea are as overjoyed as the people of the whole country. We extend our most sincere and warmest congratulations on the success of the conference and the birth of the Central People's Government. We overseas are willing to unite around the Central Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in the spirit of internationalism, and strive for the construction of a new Korea and the lasting peace of the Far East. Finally, we extend our highest respect to the representatives of the conference.

    【新华社平壤二十四日电】北朝鲜的四万多华侨从收音机中听到中国人民政治协商会议胜利开幕和中华人民共和国诞生的消息后，莫不欢欣若狂，交相祝贺。他们对毛主席在人民政治协商会议上的开幕词，尤感兴奋万分。北朝鲜华侨联合总会已通知各地分会，准备在中央人民政府成立之日，扩大庆祝。该会并于二十三日向中国人民政治协商会议发出贺电，电文如下：中国人民政治协商会议全体代表们：
    划时代的中国人民政治协商会议在全中国人民的欢呼声中于人民首都北平开幕了。
    大会的胜利开幕实现了中国人民多年来的宿望，她是中国人民百年来不屈不挠奋斗的结果，特别是二十多年来中国人民在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下英勇斗争所获得的胜利果实。中国人民从此完全摆脱了三千年来的封建压迫，一百年来的帝国主义侵略和三十年来的官僚资本主义的统治，从此可以在人民自己的中央政府领导之下，建设一个崭新的、富强的、先进的新民主主义的新中国。她将是世界民主阵营强有力的一员。
    在这伟大的划时代的人民政治协商会议开幕之际，北朝鲜四万多华侨和全国人民一样莫不欢欣若狂。谨以最真挚最热烈的敬意庆祝大会的成功和中央人民政府的诞生。我们在海外愿以国际主义精神团结在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国中央政府的周围，为建设新朝鲜和争取远东持久和平而奋斗。最后并向大会代表致以崇高的敬礼。
