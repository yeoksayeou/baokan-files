　　The work of suppressing bandits in the newly liberated areas south of the Yangtze River has achieved great results. In various places, more and more bandits are surrendering under the political offensive and military suppression of the People's Liberation Army. Since the beginning of August, the military and civilians of the Changsha and Yueyang sub-districts of Hunan Province have launched a campaign to suppress the Kuomintang's scattered bandit troops and local habitual bandits who have been harassing the area between Pingjiang, Yueyang, Linxiang, Liuyang, and Xiangyin. In more than 20 days, a total of 5,477 bandits were eliminated, including 5,025 who surrendered and were reorganized, 437 captured, and 15 killed or wounded; 5 mortars, 62 light and heavy machine guns, nearly 3,000 long and short guns, and many other materials were seized. Remnant bandits in the central Jiangxi Ji'an sub-district have also been largely wiped out. According to statistics, in the one month from late July to late August, a total of 3,000 bandits were eliminated, including more than 2,400 who were persuaded to accept reorganization and surrender. The captured included Long Xuanchi, a major general staff officer, and Dai Sui, a major general senior staff officer, and 521 other officers and soldiers. More than 6,000 long and short guns were seized. The Kuomintang's remaining bandits and special agents lurking in Zhejiang Province were quite rampant in June and July when we took over the cities and adjusted our deployments. After the beginning of August, the People's Liberation Army Field Army organized a large number of armed work teams to go to the countryside to carry out suppression work. On the one hand, a mass movement for bandit suppression and anti-espionage was organized. Through the distribution of leaflets, the holding of mass meetings, and symposiums with the families of bandits, efforts were made to persuade deceived and coerced elements to hand over their guns and surrender, and to repent to the government (this work has achieved considerable results; in the past month, more than 150 people in Yongkang alone have surrendered voluntarily). On the other hand, the obstinate bandits and special agents were resolutely tracked down and suppressed. More than 500 bandits in Shaoxing County who frequently harassed the Lizhu District have been wiped out by more than 450 in the past month's active suppression. In recent months, the grassroots armed forces and local armed forces in Lanxi and Yiwu of the 8th Military Sub-district of Zhejiang have actively suppressed bandits, engaging in more than 20 battles of varying sizes and eliminating more than 460 bandits. The bandits in various parts of Zhejiang Province are now wavering. In the course of pursuing and suppressing bandits, the bandit suppression troops in various places strictly implemented the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention, and thus won the enthusiastic help of the broad masses of the people, and gradually formed a mass movement for bandit suppression and anti-espionage. Many peasants escorted the bandit suppression troops and sent intelligence day and night, and participated in capturing scattered bandits. With the help of the People's Liberation Army, the peasants in Longyou County have formed a self-defense force of hundreds of people to fight against bandits and special agents. With the assistance of the Field Army, the local armed forces in various places overcame difficulties in bandit suppression, pursued and suppressed fiercely, and have improved a step further in terms of tactics and political quality. While suppressing bandits, they also cooperated with the staff of the people's governments at all levels to carry out mass work, establish and expand the new district democratic government.

　  江南新区剿匪获成绩
    各地已形成群众性剿匪反特务斗争
    【新华社北平十日电】长江以南新解放区的剿匪工作，已经获得很大的成绩。各地土匪在解放军政治攻势与军事进剿下，投诚者日益众多。湖南省长沙、岳阳两分区军民自八月初对窜扰平江、岳阳、临湘、浏阳、湘阴之间的国民党流散匪军及当地惯匪展开清剿以来，二十余天共消灭土匪五千四百七十七名，其中受降及改编的五千零二十五名，俘虏的四百三十七名，毙伤的十五名；缴获迫击炮五门，轻重机枪六十二挺，长短枪近三千支，其他物资甚多。江西中部吉安分区境内残匪，亦已大部肃清。据统计自七月下旬至八月下旬的一个月中，共消灭土匪三千名，其中争取接受改编及投诚的二千四百多名，俘匪少将参谋处长龙萱池，少将高级参谋戴绥以下官兵五百二十一名，缴获长短枪六千多支。浙江境内潜伏的国民党残余土匪特务，六七月份乘我接管城市，调整部署之际，活动相当猖獗。八月初以后人民解放军野战军组织大批武装工作队下乡开展清剿工作。一方面，组织了群众性的剿匪反特务斗争，通过发传单、召开群众大会及土匪家属座谈会等方式，争取受骗和胁从分子交枪投诚，向政府悔过（这个工作已获得相当成绩，过去一月中仅永康一地自动投诚的就有一百五十多人）。另一方面，对执迷不悟的土匪特务则坚决追踪剿灭。绍兴县境经常窜扰于漓渚区的土匪五百余人，经一个月来的积极清剿，已被歼四百五十多名。浙江第八军分区兰溪、义乌各地基干武装及地方武装近月来积极剿匪，大小战斗二十多次，歼匪四百六十多名。现浙江省各地土匪已呈动摇。各地剿匪部队在追剿土匪中严格地执行了三大纪律八项注意，因此获得了广大人民的热烈帮助，逐渐地形成了群众性的剿匪反特务斗争。很多农民不分昼夜，给剿匪部队带路送情报，参加捕捉散匪。龙游县农民在解放军协助下，已组成一支数百人的自卫武装，与土匪特务进行斗争。各地地方武装在野战军协助下，在剿匪中克服困难，猛追猛剿，无论在战术上或政治质量上都已提高了一步。他们在剿匪的时候，还配合各级人民政府工作人员展开了群众工作，建立和扩大了新区民主政权。
