　　Fellow Traveler
    By Soviet writer Panova, translated by Su Ling, proofread by Cao Jinghua
    　　　　Part One: Night
    Chapter Four: Yulia
    “Fifty centimeters,” Subao immediately opened his eyes and looked at the ceiling, whispering. “Fifty multiplied by one hundred and twenty equals six thousand – six kilograms…”
    “I forgot something,” the doctor thought after instructing Subao. “I forgot something, forgot…”
    Suddenly, he remembered.
    Why didn't he try to find Igor? Maybe he could have found a way back then. Make a phone call. Write a statement. Run around, ask someone for help… Confused, dreaming—make that phone call, run around? Ask who?… No, no. He could have found a way back then, definitely. But he can't do it anymore. Sonya would have been able to do it. He is too slow, he has always been slow about these things. Sonya would definitely have thought of it because she loves Igor. True love can think of everything and make it work. He doesn't love Igor very much, he never loved him very much, he is a useless, indifferent, clumsy father. He likes Lily better. What is good about her? Full of cleverness, loves to watch plays, loves to act coy. She is good at flattering… When she flatters, he gives her money to see plays, but when Igor asks him, he doesn't give it, he refuses, even for just thirty yuan… My dear child, forgive me. Take everything, take my old life in my later years, just so you live! Just so you come back! Just so you don't suddenly disappear, my child…
    At home, when sending Yulia off to join the army, her two older brothers came with their wives and children, as well as all the relatives. Everyone made snacks and churned ice cream, as if it were a birthday. Yulia personally moved the tables, covering them with snow-white tablecloths used for New Year's and festivals.
    That was twelve or thirteen days ago. Now she is moving the tables again, covering them with white tablecloths.
    The first wounded soldier arrived—a combat soldier. He leaned his gun against the corner of the wall and looked around with a seasoned eye.
    “Am I lying on that table?” he asked.
    One could tell at a glance that he was a sensible and experienced person.
    “Whatever you like,” Yulia answered kindly. “But first, take off your clothes. Where are you wounded? Your foot? Muhangna! Cut off his boots.”
    She herself stood there, holding a gown, ready for the professor to put on after washing his hands. He had a pair of white, plump, professor-like hands, just like Professor Si's hands. The window of the washing room was draped with curtains, and the dazzling white light illuminated the table. No one thought that when the entire train was so clearly illuminated from the outside by the fire in the sky, it was foolish to cover up this light.
    Muhangna cut off the wounded soldier's boots, turning away in fear.
    “Oh, what’s wrong, what’s wrong?” the wounded soldier said, frowning. “Aren't you used to it yet? This is just a minor injury. If you want to know, I can tell you—it didn't even touch the bone.”
    Yulia put the gown on the professor, poured some alcohol on his pink palms, and handed him the gloves. This handsome old man, like an actor on stage, glanced at her contented face with suspicion…
    But two minutes later, he understood her. She worked piously. Nothing needed to be asked of her, nothing needed to be reminded of. She handed him what he needed before he even thought of it.
    When bandaging the foot of the wounded soldier, he didn't care at all and didn't even groan, only occasionally letting out a sigh: “Phew…” Yulia admired this kind of patient. She hated those who yelled loudly. She was immersed in her work, no longer hearing the rumbling sounds outside. Only the muggy heat bothered her. It was terribly hot in the car, and the ventilators couldn't dissipate the heat. She used pliers to clamp a square towel and wiped the sweat from the wounded soldier's face.
    “Thank you, good mama,” the soldier said.
    They brought in a child with a fractured tibia, who had already lost consciousness. His muscles were particularly developed: probably liked to play football or ride a bicycle… She could tell at a glance that the leg had to be amputated, even before the professor did.
    “Those damned villains,” Peina said, looking at the child.
    The child's chin twitched, his teeth gnashing… The professor asked Yulia:
    “Can you administer anesthesia?”
    Can she administer anesthesia! If she really opened the window and spoke frankly, she could even perform the amputation surgery. The only reason she didn't was because formally she had no right.
    She put the anesthetic mask on the child’s face… When the saw was resounding on the bone, Peina walked to the window, turned around, and cried.
    While the surgery was in progress, Dr. Bilov came in.
    “Do you need me?” he asked.
    Yulia gave him a threatening look. He carefully walked over, stretching his neck, and carefully looked at the injured person… On another table in the washing room lay a woman.

    　　　　第一部　夜
    第四章　尤丽
    “五十公分，”苏葆立刻就睁眼望着天花板，低声说。“五十乘上一百二十，得六千——六公斤…………”
    “我把什么忘了，”医生向苏葆交代完了之后，想着。“我把什么忘了，忘了………”
    突然他想起来了。
    他怎么一点都没生法找伊戈尔呢？大概当时可以生法的。打电话。写声明书。到那奔走一下，托一托谁……糊涂，作梦——往那打电话，到那奔走？托谁？………不，不。当时可以生点办法呢，一定的。不过他不会办吧了。梭妮许会办理的。他太迟钝，从来对这些事情他都是迟钝的。梭妮一定会想到的，因为她爱伊戈尔。真正的爱，一切都会想得到，作得通的。他不大爱伊戈尔，他从来不大爱他，他是一个无用的，漠不关心的，拙笨的父亲呵。他比较喜欢莉莉些。她好处在什么地方呢？满肚子心眼，爱看戏，爱撒娇。她是会献殷勤的能手………她一献殷勤，他就给她钱去看戏，可是伊戈尔找他要时，他就不给，就拒绝了，可怜只三十块钱………我的亲孩子，原谅我吧。你把一切都拿去吧，把我的晚年的老命都拿去吧，只要你活着！只要回来！只要别突然没有了，我的孩子……
    在家里当给尤丽送行从军的时候，她的两个哥哥带着他们妻子和孩子们，以及所有的亲族都来了。大家作着点心，搅着冰淇淋，好象过生日似的。尤丽亲自搬动着桌子，铺上雪白的过年过节用的桌布。
    这是十二三天以前的事。现在她又在搬动着桌子，铺着白色的桌布。
    第一个受伤的来了——这是一个战斗兵。他把枪往墙角里一靠，很精干的环顾了一番。
    “我躺到那张桌子上呢？”他问道。
    一望就知道是个通达事理，老有经验的人。
    “你随便吧，”尤丽慈祥的回答着。“不过你首先把衣服脱了。你那伤了？脚吗？穆恒娜！你把他的靴子割下来。”
    她自己站在那儿，手里拿着一件衣罩，预备等教授洗过手好穿。他有着一双白胖的，教授似的手，就象斯教授的手似的。洗涤室的窗子挂着窗幔，眩目的白色的灯光，照在桌上。谁也没想到，当整个的列车，被满天的火光从外边照得那样明显的时候，把这灯光遮起来真是糊涂事。
    穆恒娜把伤兵的靴子割下来，害怕的转过身去。
    “呵，你怎么了，怎么了？”伤兵皱着眉头说。“你还没有过惯吗？这只是轻伤，假如你想知道的话，我可以告诉你——连骨头都没伤着呢。”
    尤丽把衣罩给教授穿上，往他那粉红的手掌上倒了些酒精，把手套递给他。这位英俊的老头，好象舞台上的演员似的，狐疑的对她那心满意足的面孔望了一眼……
    可是两分钟之后，他明白她了。她虔诚的工作着。什么事情都不必问她，任何事情都不需要提醒她的。他所需要的东西，不等他想到，她就递给他了。
    这位脚上受伤的兵士，给他裹伤的时候，他毫不在乎的一声也不哼，只偶然的长出一口气：“砩………”尤丽很佩服这种病人。她讨厌那些大声乱叫的人。她沉没在自己的工作里，再听不见外边的轰隆的响声了。只有闷热使她心烦起来。当时车里热得要命，通风机也把热气吹散不了。她用钳子夹了一块方巾，把伤兵脸上的汗擦了擦。
    “谢谢你，”好妈妈，兵士说着。
    把一个打碎胫骨的孩子抬来了，他已经失去了知觉。他的筋肉特别发达：大概是爱踢足球或是爱骑脚踏车………她一眼就看出来那只腿要锯了的，比教授先看出来呢。
    “那些该死的恶徒，”裴娜看着这孩子说着。
    孩子的下巴抽动了一下，牙咬得吱吱响着………教授问尤丽道：
    “你会上麻药吗？”
    她会上麻药吗！如果真正打开窗子说亮话，她连割锯的手术都会呢。她所以不下手的，只因为形式上她无权。
    她把麻药面罩放到孩子脸上……当锯在骨头上响的时候，裴娜走到窗子跟前，转过身子，哭起来了。
    正在动手术的时候，比洛夫医生进来了。
    “需要我吗？”他问着。
    尤丽向他投了一个威吓的眼色，他小心的走到跟前，伸着脖子，仔细看着受伤的人……在洗涤室的另一张桌上，躺着一个女子。
