　　Introduction to the Production Movement and Experience in the Former Taihang Area
　　Shi Linqi
　　(I) The Production Movement
　　This year's production movement has the following characteristics:
　　A. Small-scale labor mutual aid has developed widely
　　The scale of organization this year is more extensive than in previous years. For example, statistics from 462 villages in seven counties including Ping, Chang, Ling, Xing, Zan, Nei, and She show that participants in mutual aid account for 63 percent of the total number of households. Statistics from 150 villages in Xingtai show that participants in mutual aid during the summer harvest accounted for 41 percent of the total number of households, an unprecedented level of widespread participation. There are two reasons for this: First, after the land reform, farmers' enthusiasm for production increased, but they also felt that labor and animal power were insufficient, so they urgently demanded to be organized. For example, statistics from 13 villages in 11 counties show that out of a total of 9,376 households, those with both labor and animal power accounted for 42.7 percent, those with labor but no animal power accounted for 31.85 percent, those with animal power but no labor accounted for 5.25 percent, and those lacking both labor and animal power accounted for 20.2 percent. Second, the previous deviations of forced mobilization, blindly "improving and consolidating," only allowing entry into the group but not allowing withdrawal, and assigning many administrative tasks to the mutual aid group were corrected. It was earnestly done on a voluntary, equivalent, small-scale, and flexible basis, which was welcomed by the broad masses. In addition, the leading and exemplary roles of Party members, labor heroes, and activists have achieved better results than in previous years.
　　The forms of mutual aid groups this year can be roughly divided into the following types:
　　(1) Long-term fixed mutual aid with Party members or labor heroes as the core, generally with unified farming plans and methods for deploying labor (such as assigning one person to engage in transportation and supplying coal for the whole group), using work points to calculate work, and farming techniques can also be improved. This type of village accounts for about 20 percent of the organized villages in the old areas.
　　(2) Labor-equivalent exchange labor mutual aid. Those with higher labor intensity adopt a work-for-work system, and those with weaker labor adjust the work appropriately.
　　(3) Unified labor and animal power mutual aid and exchange labor, implementing the exchange of labor and animal power.
　　(4) Mutual aid groups combined with the use of larger production tools, such as sharing waterwheels, with some contributing wheels, some contributing labor, and some contributing animal power, forming groups together.
　　(5) Larger-scale mutual aid for certain tasks, such as repairing river滩地, and pushing large carts and pulling water to plant seeds in distant places during droughts. The group disbands after the work is completed.
　　(6) Mutual aid between relatives and friends, mostly during the busy farming season. Relatives and friends help each other without work points, wages, or organization, but the work done is more solid.
　　The above forms all have the advantages of being small-scale and flexible. Some have group leaders, and some do not, but all have one or two enthusiastic and technically innovative core figures to lead. Through the exemplary actions of Party members to unite the core figures in the mutual aid group around the branch, holding meetings of production activists in a timely manner to improve technology and exchange experience has not only promoted the production movement but also further improved the relationship between the Party and the masses.
　　B. Large numbers of women participated in the production movement
　　There are approximately one million women with full or semi-labor capacity in the entire area. Those who participated in the weeding movement accounted for more than 60 percent, with better villages accounting for 80 percent and general villages accounting for 50 percent. The Anyang Special District mobilized more than 500,000 women to fight locusts, and 60 villages in the Xinxiang Special District mobilized more than 20,000 women to fight locusts. Xiuwu County alone produced 1,200 female model activists. During the summer harvest movement in the Xingtai Special District, 80 percent of the women participated in harvesting, pushing carts, carrying wheat, threshing, etc. As a result, the summer harvest work was completed three days earlier than in previous years. Not only did it exceed previous years in quantity, but many women also learned farming techniques from men, improving agricultural efficiency.
　　The following experiences were gained in mobilizing women to participate in the production movement:
　　(1) It is necessary to mobilize women to participate in the production movement on the basis of advocating family democracy and harmony, labor production, and getting rich. This is the only way to mobilize the production enthusiasm of both male and female farmers and truly improve the status of women. Unilaterally and isolatedly emphasizing that women should take on a portion of land (this is only a problem for a portion of divorced or widowed women remarrying) will inevitably alienate the broad masses and be detrimental to production. Facts have proven that if the family is not harmonious or democratic, there is no desire to produce, and waste is easily formed.
　　(2) While mobilizing women to participate in production, it is also necessary to seize the opportunity to solve their other personal needs. For example, women with many children or those with illnesses should be helped to solve their difficulties, combined with explaining hygiene knowledge, organizing doctors to treat illnesses, etc. This not only protects women's health but also increases labor and gradually overcomes women's superstitious psychology, reducing the scope of activities of secret societies.
　　(3) If you want to mobilize and organize women to participate in the production of each season, so that women are organized into the production movement in batches continuously, you must specifically summarize the production achievements of each season, calculate labor, and educate cadres and the masses to recognize the importance and necessity of mobilizing women to participate in production. This is the only way to continuously improve women's enthusiasm for participating in production, learn agricultural techniques, and ensure women's enthusiasm for participating in production throughout the year.
　　(4) Advocate family saving and production, "living a good life," and mobilize the whole family to formulate a production and saving plan and strive to achieve the plan. This can not only mobilize the enthusiasm of the whole family to work but also promote democracy, unity, and harmony in the family, and improve women's production enthusiasm.
　　At present, there has been some success in mobilizing women to participate in production, but not enough has been done to improve women's political awareness to consolidate their production enthusiasm, and the organization of women's work has not been better combined with the development of the production movement, and not enough has been done to solve the special problems of women themselves.
　　C. Digging canals, sinking wells, and building water conservancy projects have achieved remarkable results
　　According to incomplete statistics from the entire area, a total of 409 new canals have been opened, 1,496 old canals have been repaired, 16,056 new wells have been dug, 3,575 old wells have been repaired, 1,852 waterwheels have been purchased, and 4,372 old waterwheels have been repaired, increasing paddy fields by 529,417 mu and reducing waterlogged land by 609,906 mu.
　　In carrying out this work, it is first necessary to attach importance to technical guidance and careful planning, especially for large-scale projects. Matters such as surveying, measuring, assigning work sections, and tools and materials must be fully prepared in advance; otherwise, it will inevitably lead to waste of manpower or affect the completion of the project (such as the river management project of the Fourth Special Commissioner's Office, although it has achieved great results, it wasted 200,000 manpower due to poor planning). Secondly, all economic departments must pay attention to supporting the masses in developing small-scale water conservancy projects. The Yuanshi Cooperative organized a waterwheel repair station, the Neiqiu County Federation of Cooperatives organized the masses to exchange wheat for waterwheels, and the use of bank water conservancy special funds all achieved good results. Third, there must be sound water conservancy management, democratically elected management committees, and the absorption of water conservancy experts for guidance. Agreements on water use, management, and repairs are formulated through mass consultation to overcome village-based egoism, water theft, and leakage.
　　D. The topdressing movement has been widely carried out
　　This year, the villages applying topdressing account for more than 70 percent in the old areas, with each mu applying from 5 to 20 dan. The semi-old areas are worse. The experience of organizing topdressing is mostly based on production increase plans, spreading the actual effects of topdressing, and cooperatives purchasing fertilizer on behalf of the masses (such as sesame cake, red alum, black alum, etc.) and then organizing labor to absorb the broad masses of women and children to accumulate and apply fertilizer. This year, the slogan of "processing and fertilizing" in the weeding movement has been widely responded to by the masses, changing the old habit of not applying topdressing in the past. The development of the topdressing movement has played a major role in ensuring a 10 percent increase in production.
　　The above four items are the main situations in production. Now, except for individual areas in the Fourth and Fifth Districts that are still suffering from drought (14,000 mu of autumn seedlings have died from drought in the four counties of Qin, Bo, Wu, and Wen), most areas have lush green crops, strong and tall, and farmers are also visibly pleased.
　　However, in actual work, there are still major shortcomings:
　　First, although the enthusiasm of the broad masses for production has been mobilized through in-depth publicity of "organizing to get rich," many cadres have not yet learned to lead production. In general, they are still stuck in slogan mobilization, making plans, filling out forms, or reciting resolutions from higher levels in a preachy manner. Therefore, the leadership of production appears empty and weak. That is, on the one hand, the Party's policies are supported by the masses, and the masses' enthusiasm for production is unprecedentedly high, while on the other hand, the specific leadership shows a tendency towards spontaneity. At the same time, although attention has been paid to the leadership of the branch in production, less attention has been paid to the daily education of the branch and the construction of the branch in combination with production. Later, after the district party committee issued instructions on the leadership of the branch in the production movement and the decision on branch work, there was progress to varying degrees in various places.
　　Second, although all localities have greatly exerted the role of activists, implemented reward policies (such as public praise, issuing certificates, etc.), and promoted experience to promote the production movement, the discovery and cultivation of labor heroes is still insufficient. There are not many typical figures in one district or one county, and the requirements for typical labor heroes are too high. Instead of giving full play to their expertise, they are required to be perfect in all aspects, such as production technology, political awareness, and mass relations.
　　Third, except for some areas, most areas lack extremely research, guidance, and exchange of experience in agricultural technology. Attention should be paid to promoting this in the future.
　　Now that the Beginning of Autumn has passed, all localities have been called upon to carry out the green manure pressing movement, adjust and select seeds, and prepare for the autumn harvest and wheat planting. There are also wasteland reduction tasks in the new areas, and flood prevention and drainage work is being carried out in various places along the river.

　　(II) Eliminating bandits
　　The Henan North New Area restoration area has a population of approximately 1.57 million, which can be roughly divided into two types of areas. One is the areas of Jiaozuo, Xiuwu, Huojia, Wuzhi, etc., liberated last winter. After two stages of combining large-scale bandit suppression with production last winter, most of the enemy and puppet personnel have registered, most of the guns have been handed over, the masses have been initially mobilized, and a preliminary democratic order has been established. The other is the areas around Anyang and Xinxiang, liberated in May this year. Although certain achievements have been made in the two-month bandit suppression movement, the mobilization of the masses is not yet sufficient, and social order is not yet stable. According to statistics from 12 counties including Wuzhi, Xiuwu, Huojia, Boai, and Anyang, 11,094 registered enemy and puppet personnel and scattered soldiers and bandits, 1,849 have undergone short-term education and transformation, and 8,791 enemy and puppet rifles and pistols have been seized. The old regime has been preliminarily transformed, and a large number of activists have emerged, laying the foundation for further mobilizing the masses.

　　前太行区的生产运动与经验的介绍
    史林琪
  　（一）生产运动
    今年生产运动有如下几个特点：
     甲、小型劳动互助普遍发展
    今年组织起来的规模较往年广泛，如平、长、陵、邢、赞、内、涉等七县四六二村统计，参加互助者占总户数百分之六十三。邢台一五○村统计夏收中参加互助者，占总户数百分之四十一，其广泛程度空前未有。其原因有二：第一，土地改革结束后，农民生产情绪高涨，但又感劳力畜力不足，故迫切要求组织起来，如十一个县十三村统计，共九三七六户，其中劳畜力俱全者占百分之四二·七，有劳力无畜力者占百分之三一·八五，有畜力无劳力者占百分之五·二五，劳畜力均缺者占百分之二○·二。第二，纠正了以往的强迫动员盲目“提高巩固”，只许进组不许退组，以及强给互助组许多行政工作任务等偏向，认真作到自愿等价、小型灵活、为广大群众所欢迎。加之党员干部、劳动英雄、积极分子的带头、领导，乃获得超于往年的成绩。
    今年互助组之形式，约可分为以下几种：
    （一）以党员或劳动英雄为核心，长年固定的互助，一般均有统一耕作计划和调度劳力办法（如抽出一人搞运输，供给全组烧煤等），使用工票计工，耕作技术亦可提高。此种村庄在老区约占已组织起来的村庄的百分之二十左右。
    （二）劳力相等变工互助，劳力强度较高采用工换工制，劳力弱者，酌情变工。
    （三）劳畜力统一互助变工，实行劳畜力互换。
    （四）使用较大的生产工具结合起来的互助组，如伙用水车，有的出车轮，有的出劳力，有的出畜力，互相碰组。
    （五）一定活计的较大型互助，如修河滩地，以及天旱时在较远的地方推大车、拉水点种等，活计做完即散伙。
    （六）亲友邻朋之互助，大半在农忙季节，亲朋互助，无工票，无工资，无组织，但所做活计较为踏实。
    上述各种形式均以小型、灵活为其优点，有的有组长，有的无组长，但均有一二个热心劳动与改良技术的核心人物进行领导，经过党员之模范行动团结互助组中之核心人物在支部周围，适时召开生产积极分子会议，改进技术，交流经验，不仅推动了生产运动，且使党与群众的关系得进一步改善。
  　乙、广大妇女参加了生产运动
    全区全半劳力妇女约计百万，参加锄苗运动者约占百分之六十以上，较好村庄则占百分之八十，一般村占百分之五十。安阳专区动员了五十余万妇女打蝗，新乡专区六十个村动员了妇女二万余人打蝗，修武一县即涌现一二○○个妇女模范积极分子，邢台专区夏收运动中百分之八十的妇女参加收割、推小车、担麦、打场等；因而夏收工作较往年提早三日完成。不仅在数量上超过往年，且不少妇女向男人学习耕作技术，提高农作效率。
    发动妇女参加生产运动有如下经验：
    （一）必须是在提倡家庭民主和睦、劳动生产、发家致富的基础上，发动妇女参加生产运动，这样才能发动男女农民的生产热情，也才能真正提高妇女的地位。片面孤立的强调妇女带一份地（这只是一部分离婚或寡妇出嫁的问题）必将脱离广大群众，而于生产不利。事实证明，家庭不和，不民主，则无心生产，且易形成浪费。
    （二）发动妇女参加生产，同时必须抓紧解决其其他切身要求，如对孩子多或有疾病的妇女应帮助解决其困难，结合讲解卫生常识，组织医生治病等，这样不仅保障妇女身体健康，且能增加劳动力，又能逐渐克服妇女迷信心理，缩小会道门之活动范围。
    （三）如想发动与组织妇女参加各个季节之生产，使妇女接连不断的一批一批的组织到生产运动中来，这就必须具体总结各个季节之生产成绩，计算劳力，教育干部与群众认识发动妇女参加生产之重要性与必要性，这样才能不断提高妇女参加生产之热情，学习农作技术，保证妇女全年参加生产之积极性。
    （四）提倡家庭节约生产，“过好日月”，发动全家订出生产节约计划，为实现计划而努力。这样不仅可以发动全家劳动的积极性，且可民主团结，和睦家庭，提高妇女生产热情。
    目前对发动妇女参加生产较有成绩，但对提高妇女政治觉悟，以巩固生产积极性，尚做得不够，且妇女之组织工作未能更好的与生产运动的开展相结合，对妇女本身特殊问题亦解决不够。
　  丙、开渠打井，兴修水利，取得显著成绩
    据全区不完全统计，共开新渠四○九道，修理旧渠一四九六道，打新井一六○五六眼，修旧井三五七五眼，购买水车一八五二架，修旧水车四三七二架，共增水田五二九四一七亩，减少水淹地六○九九○六亩。
    在进行这一工作中，首先必须重视技术指导与周密计划，尤其浩大工程更须如此，如勘察、测量、占工分段、工具工料等，均须事先充分准备，否则必致浪费民力或影响工程之完成（如四专署之治河工程，虽有很大成绩，却因计划不周，浪费民力二十万）。其次各经济部门必须注意扶植群众开展小型水利，元氏合作社组织水车修理站，内邱县联社组织群众以麦子换回水车，以及银行水利专款之使用，均收到良好效果。第三，必须有健全之水利管理，民选管理委员会，吸收水利专家进行指导，经过群众公议制定用水与看管、修补等公约，克服村本位主义偷水漏水等现象。
  　丁、普遍开展了上追肥运动
    今年上追肥的村庄老区可占百分之七十以上，每亩上到五担至二十担不等，半老区则较差。组织上追肥的经验多是从增产计划出发，传播上追肥之实际效果，合作社代购肥料（如麻饼、红、黑矾等）进而组织劳力，吸收广大妇女儿童积肥上肥。今年在锄苗运动中“加工加肥”的口号，普遍得到群众响应，改变了过去不上追肥的旧习惯，追肥运动的开展对保证增产一成，起重大作用。
    以上四项为生产中之主要情况，现在除四、五分区个别地区仍有旱灾外（沁、博、武、温四县旱死秋苗一四○○○亩），绝大部分地区庄稼绿油一片，壮而且高，农民亦喜形于色。
    但在实际工作中，仍有重大缺点：
    第一，虽经过深入宣传“组织起来发家致富”，发动了广大群众生产热情，但因不少干部仍未学会领导生产，一般的仍停留在口号动员、订计划、填表格、或是说教似的背诵上级决议，因而对生产领导表现空泛无力，即一方面党的政策为群众拥护，群众生产情绪空前高涨，而一方面在具体领导上则表现了自流，同时虽注意了支部在生产中的领导，但对支部日常教育和结合生产建设支部则注意较差。后经区党委发出支部对生产运动之领导及支部工作决定之指示后，各地才有不同程度的进步。
    第二，各地虽大量发挥了积极分子的作用，实行了奖励政策（如当众表扬、发奖状等），推广经验，推动了生产运动，但发现与培养劳动英雄尚不够，一个区一个县的典型人物不多，对劳动英雄典型人物要求过高，不是发挥其一技之长，而是要求不论在生产技术、政治觉悟、群众关系等各方面都十全十美。
    第三，除部分地区外，多数地区对农业技术的研究、指导、与交流经验，极为不够，今后须注意提倡。
    现立秋已过，已号召各地开展压绿肥运动，调剂选择种子，为秋收种麦作准备，在新区另有减荒任务，沿河各地正在开展防汛排涝工作。
    （二）肃匪工作
    豫北新区恢复区约有一百五十七万人口，大体可分两种地区，一为去冬解放的焦作、修武、获嘉、武陟等地，经过去冬较大规模的肃匪与生产相结合两段运动，敌伪人员大部进行登记，枪支大部缴出，群众得到初步发动，初步建立了民主秩序。另一种是今年五月解放的安阳、新乡两市及其周围地区，在两个月肃匪运动中，虽然取得一定成绩，但群众发动尚不充分，社会秩序尚不稳定。据武陟、修武、获嘉、博爱、安阳等十二县统计，敌伪人员散兵游勇已登记者一一○九四人，经短期教育改造者一八四九人，收缴敌伪长短枪支八七九一支，并初步改造旧政权，涌现出大量积极分子，为下一步发动群众准备下基础。
