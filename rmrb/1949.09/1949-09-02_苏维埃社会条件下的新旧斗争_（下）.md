The Struggle Between the Old and the New in Soviet Social Conditions (Part 2)
    By Fuyueduofu

    Comrade Zhdanov said at the discussion meeting on Alexanderov's book "History of Western European Philosophy": "In our Soviet society, hostile classes have been eliminated, and the struggle between the old and the new, and thus the development from the lower to the higher, does not proceed in the form of class struggle and great变革 as it does under capitalism, but in the form of criticism and self-criticism. Criticism and self-criticism are the real driving force of our development and a powerful tool in the hands of the Party. This is undoubtedly a new mode of movement, a new type of development, and a new dialectical law."

    Self-criticism is one of the requirements of the Leninist method. The Bolshevik Party has applied the method of self-criticism throughout its entire history. The slogan of self-criticism has had special development in our Party and in the country after the 15th National Congress of the CPSU (B.). At that time, a new situation arose due to the purge of opposition factions within the Party. Comrade Stalin said:

    "What is new in the situation? It is that we will no longer have or hardly have any opposition factions. It is that, in view of the easy victory over the opposition factions (this victory itself is the Party's most serious advantage), there may be a danger within the Party of being complacent with achievements, indulging in comfort, sleeping for a while, and ignoring the shortcomings of our work. Easy victory over the opposition factions is the greatest advantage of our Party. But this victory itself contains its own special shortcomings, which lie in the possibility that the Party may fall into complacency, narcissism, and contentment with achievements. What does it mean to be content with achievements? It means putting an obstacle in the way of our progress. If this is not to happen, we need self-criticism. This is not the malicious, essentially counter-revolutionary criticism carried out by the opposition factions, but honest, open criticism, Bolshevik self-criticism. The 15th National Congress of our Party considered this situation and put forward the slogan of self-criticism." (Volume 2, page 490 of "Lenin and Stalin on Party Building")

    There are two types of criticism: one that is hostile to the socialist cause, attempting to injure and slander our motherland, our system, our life, our achievements, and aiming to fight us and weaken the Soviet Union. There is also Soviet, Bolshevik criticism, which arises from the tasks of socialist construction and aims to overcome shortcomings. This is honest criticism that promotes the realization of the great ideals of communism. This kind of criticism is not afraid to expose shortcomings in the sharpest way. It is an indicator of the extent to which the Soviet people are confident in their own strength and serves as the most important tool for them to solve the tasks before them.

    Among the broad masses of working people who are conscious of the lofty tasks and goals of the development of socialist society, innovators have emerged in all aspects of social life. In the words of Comrade Stalin, these innovators represent the "future" of our development. In the struggle against what is dying and falling behind, the advanced lead more and more of the masses onto the road of forward development of socialist society. Comrade Stalin said that great goals produce great strength. The lofty task of building communism inspires hundreds of millions of workers, collective farm peasants, and intellectuals to achieve new labor achievements. And in these hard-won achievements, the creative and critical thinking of the true innovators of socialist production is manifested. A vivid example is the powerful and widespread movement of advanced workers, engineers, and technicians to transfer factories, departments, workshops, and entire factories to the use of Stakhanovite production methods. The creators of this movement sharply criticized the old production methods and forms of labor organization, proving that they did not conform to the enormous possibilities laid down by socialist production. They discovered new and better working methods and forms of labor organization and led the struggle to promote them. They emerged as true innovators and revolutionaries in labor, and organizers of the broad masses' movement. This movement is destroying the old labor methods and outdated productivity, leading socialist production to glorious new victories.

    Criticism and self-criticism not only enable us to expose and discover the contradictions of socialist society but also serve as a means of overcoming these contradictions. The forms of criticism and self-criticism that the Party uses for the benefit of the development of socialist society are diverse. Public, comradely criticism and self-criticism in publications and at meetings, taking the greatest responsibility for the people, supervising and assessing the completion of tasks in all aspects of Soviet and state organs—these are only a few of the methods of criticism and self-criticism that play a role in Soviet society.

    In Soviet society, an important and practical form of criticism and self-criticism is socialist competition.

    Comrade Stalin said: "Socialist competition is a manifestation of realistic, revolutionary mass self-criticism, which relies on the creative initiative of millions of working people."

    Socialist competition is criticism through facts. If your comrade achieves a higher labor productivity than you in work, and the quality index is also better than yours, if he "defeats" you in socialist competition, this is an obvious practical criticism of your work. This criticism forces you to improve in order to catch up with the comrade who has surpassed you, and urges you to engage in more intensive and greater creative activity.

    Socialist competition is a mass, people's movement, and in this movement, the power of example plays a huge role. Socialist competition, according to Lenin, "submits" the activities of every worker in socialist society "to the judgment of the masses." This movement awakens the initiative and talents of millions of workers, peasants, and intellectuals, as well as a studious, critical, and creative spirit.

    Socialist competition is a movement of innovators and creators. Comrade Stalin said that the Stakhanov movement "is destroying the old views of technology, destroying the old technical standards, the old scheduled production capacity, and the old production plans, and demanding the establishment of new, higher technical standards, scheduled production capacity, and production plans. The task of the Stakhanov movement is to carry out a revolution in our industry, and it is precisely for this reason that the Stakhanov movement is deeply revolutionary in its basis" ("Problems of Leninism," 11th edition, page 494).

    In the course of socialist competition, especially in its highest stage—the Stakhanov movement—many new people have emerged. In the words of Comrade Stalin, these people "have completely mastered the technology of their business and are driving it forward."

    The absence of exploiting classes hostile to the people in the Soviet Union, the moral and political unity of the people, and the consciousness, purposefulness, and planning of our development—these are the conditions that make criticism and self-criticism a form of struggle between the old and the new in socialist society.

    The characteristics of criticism and self-criticism as a form of progress in socialist society lie, first of all, in the fact that under this form of progress towards a higher new stage, the struggle between the old and the new is not a struggle between classes with opposing and mutually exclusive interests. This is a form of progress and development in a society characterized by moral and political unity.

    In a society united by moral and political unity, the maintainers of social progress are all engaged in creative work, and the overcoming of the old is carried out in the process of this creative work.

    Under the conditions of hostile struggle between the new and the old, the old dominates the new until the new triumphs, and even after the new triumphs, it is still more powerful than the new. Under the conditions of the moral and political unity of the entire society, the new dominates the old and is immeasurably more powerful than the old.

    Under the conditions of the moral and political unity of the entire society, the new overcomes the old mainly by means of education, persuasion, and transforming people's consciousness in the process of establishing new forms of life. And self-criticism is a form of increasing the speed of development from backwardness to progress.

    Under the current conditions of the development of Soviet society, self-criticism has a renewed significance. Now that a socialist society has been established in our country, progress means moving towards communism. In order for this progress to proceed victoriously, it is not only necessary to have a new and higher level of development of productive forces but also to have a new and higher level of communist consciousness. To conduct communist education for the people and to educate them in the spirit of infinite loyalty to communist ideas is now the primary and fundamental task. But any further progress in the development of communist consciousness is inextricably linked to the intensification of the struggle against the remnants of the old in people's consciousness and to further overcoming these remnants.

    At the same time, the achievements of the development of socialist society and its progress towards communism are making the enemies of socialism abroad increasingly angry. They see the achievements of communist construction in the Soviet Union as a dangerous (from their point of view) example for the working people of all capitalist countries. This example can revolutionize the masses of the people and inspire them to fight for their own liberation. The growing prestige of the Soviet social system, especially after the Second World War (the Soviet social system has proven its invincible vitality and strength), explains the current slander campaign by reactionary forces abroad against the Soviet socialist system and against the Soviet people, aimed at weakening the position of socialism. Intensifying the struggle against democratic and progressive forces, the reactionary forces abroad, who harbor particular malice towards the Soviet Union, are now trying, and will try in the future, to find support among those in our country who are least tempered in the struggle against reactionary bourgeois ideology, and are trying to revive the old in the consciousness of these people.

    All this requires an offensive struggle against the remnants of the old in people's consciousness and against the hostile influence of reactionary bourgeois ideology.

    The significance of Bolshevik criticism and self-criticism lies, first and foremost, in the fact that its purpose is to expose these hostile influences and resolutely overcome them.

    The complexity of the great cause of building a perfect communist society requires all Soviet people to make their greatest efforts, to constantly carry out self-education and self-training, to resolutely drive out everything that is corrupt, dead, and outdated, and to carry out a systematic and tireless struggle against the enemies of socialism. In order to victoriously solve the great tasks of the Soviet people, all Soviet people must raise their demands on themselves and must carry out tireless, Bolshevik self-criticism.

    Bolshevik criticism and self-criticism are the tested weapons of the Party of Lenin and Stalin. The Party of Lenin and Stalin makes this weapon serve the victorious construction of communism. Bolshevik criticism and self-criticism are the real driving force of Soviet social development.

　　苏维埃社会条件下的新旧斗争　（下）
    夫约多洛夫作
    日丹诺夫同志在关于亚力山德罗夫所著“西欧哲学史”一书的讨论会上发言时说：“在我们的苏维埃社会里，敌对阶级被肃清了，新旧斗争以及因而从低级到高级的发展，不是象在资本主义之下那样以敌对阶级斗争与大变革的方式进行的，而是以批评与自我批评的方式进行的。批评与自我批评是我们发展的真正动力，是党手中强有力的工具。这无疑地是新的运动方式，新的发展类型，新的辩证规律。”
    自我批评是列宁主义方法的要求之一。布尔什维克党在其整个历史过程中都应用了自我批评的方法。自我批评的口号在我们党内与在全国有特别的发展，是在联共（布）党第十五次全国代表大会以后。那时，由于肃清了党内的反对派而产生了新的情况。斯大林同志说：
    “情况的新处何在。它就在于：我们不再会有或几乎不再会有反对派了。它就在于：鉴于轻易地战胜了反对派（这一胜利本身便是党最严重的优势），党内可能产生安于既得成就、耽于安心、稍微睡一会儿、无视我们工作缺点等现象的危险。轻易地战胜反对派。是我们党最大的优势。但这一胜利本身含有自己的特殊缺点，这就在于：党可能跌入自满感里、自恋感里，安于既得的成就。安于既得的成就意味着什么？这就意味着对我们的前进加了一个障碍。若要没有这种情况发生，我们便需要自我批评。这不是反对派所进行的、恶意的、本质上反革命的批评，而是正直的、公开的批评，布尔什维克的自我批评。我们党第十五次全国代表大会考虑了这一情况而提出了自我批评的口号”。（“列宁与斯大林论党的建设”第二卷第四九○页）
    批评有两种，有敌视社会主义事业，力图中伤与污蔑我们的祖国、我们的制度、我们的生活、我们的成绩、目的在与我们斗争并削弱苏联的批评。也有苏维埃的、布尔什维克的、出于社会主义建设任务的，目的在克服缺点的批评。这是正直的、促进共产主义伟大思想实现的批评。这种批评不怕最尖锐地暴露缺点。它是苏维埃人民确信自己力量的程度的指标，并充当着他们解决自己面前任务的最重要工具。
    在意识了社会主义社会发展的崇高任务与目标的广大劳动人民中，涌现了社会生活各方面的革新者。照斯大林同志的话说，这些革新者代表了我们发展的“将来”。在反对正在死亡和正在落后的东西的斗争中，先进者带引着愈来愈多的群众走上社会主义社会向前发展的道路。斯大林同志说，伟大的目标产生伟大的力量。建立共产主义的崇高任务，鼓舞了成千百万工人、集体农庄农民与知识分子去取得新的劳动功绩。而在这些劳苦功绩中，便表现了社会主义生产的真正革新者的创造性与批评性的思想。鲜明的范例便是先进的工人、工程师、技师使工厂的各部门、各车间以及整个工厂转至使用斯达哈诺夫式生产方法的强大而广泛的运动。这一运动的主创者们对旧的生产方法与劳动组织形式的估价提出了尖锐的批评，证明了其不符合社会主义生产所奠下的巨大可能性。他们发现了更完善的新工作方法与劳动组织形式，领导了使其发扬起来的斗争。他们涌现为劳动中真正的革新者与革命者，广大人民运动的组织者。这一运动正在摧毁着旧的劳动方法与过时了的生产率，引导社会主义生产走向光辉的新胜利。
    批评与自我批评不仅使我们可以暴露和发掘社会主义社会的矛盾，同时也是克服这些矛盾的手段。党为了社会主义社会发展的利益所利用的批评与自我批评的形式，是多种多样的。在出版物与会议上进行公开的同志态度的批评与自我批评，对人民负最大的责任，监督与考核苏维埃机关与国家机关各环节中的完成任务——这些仅是在苏维埃社会里起作用的批评与自我批评方法之很少一部分的名目。
    在苏维埃社会里，批评与自我批评的重要而实际的形式，便是社会主义竞赛。
    斯大林同志说：“社会主义竞赛，乃是实事求是的、革命的群众自我批评的表现，这一自我批评依赖于千百万劳动人民的创造主动性。”
    社会主义竞赛，乃是以事实来进行的批评。假如你的同志在工作上所达到的劳动生产率比你的高，质量指数也比你的好，假如他在社会主义竞赛中“击败了”你，这便是对你的工作的一个显而易见的实际批评。这一批评迫使你上进以赶上那超过了你的同志，催促你进行更紧张更大力的创造活动。
    社会主义竞赛，乃是群众性的、人民运动，而在这一运动里，范例的力量起着巨大的作用。社会主义竞赛把社会主义社会中每一个劳动者的活动，照列宁的说法，“提交群众评判”。这一运动唤醒着千百万工人、农民与知识分子的主动性与才能，以及好研究的、批判的、创造的精神。
    社会主义竞赛，乃是革新者与创造者的运动。斯大林同志说，斯达哈诺夫运动，“摧毁着对技术的旧看法，摧毁着旧的技术标准，旧的预定生产能力与旧的生产计划，而要求建立新的、更高的技术标准、预定生产能力与生产计划。斯达哈诺夫运动的任务是要在我们的工业中进行革命，正因为如此，所以斯达哈诺夫运动在其基础上是深具革命性的”（“列宁主义问题”第十一版第四九四页）。
    在社会主义竞赛的进程中，尤其是在其最高阶段——斯达哈诺夫运动中，产生了许多新人。照斯大林同志的说法，这些人“完全掌握了自己业务的技术，而驱驰它便前进”。
    苏联的没有敌视人民的剥削阶级存在，人民的道德与政治的统一，我们发展的自觉性、目的性与计划性——这便是批评与自我批评成为社会主义社会里的新旧斗争形式的条件。
    作为社会主义社会前进形式的批评与自我批评的特性，首先便在于：在这一走向更高的新阶段的前进形式下，新旧斗争不是有对立而相斥的利益的阶级之间的斗争。这是以道德与政治的统一为特性的社会的前进与发展的形式。
    在用道德与政治的统一结合起来的社会里，社会进步的保持者都在从事创造工作，而旧东西的克服，便是在这一创造工作的过程中进行的。
    在敌对的新旧斗争的条件下，旧东西统治着新东西直到新东西胜利之时，甚至在新东西胜利以后，还仍然比新东西强有力些。在全社会的道德与政治统一的条件下，新东西统治着旧东西，并比旧东西无可衡量地强有力些。
    在全社会的道德与政治统一的条件下，新东西克服旧东西主要地是用教育、说服、在建立新生活形式的过程中改造人们的意识等方法达成的。而自我批评乃是使落后到进步的发展中的一种增加其速度的形式。
    在苏维埃社会发展的现条件下，自我批评具有更新的意义。在我们国内已建立了社会主义社会的现在，前进便意味着走向共产主义。而为了使这一前进胜利地进行，不仅需要有新的、更高的生产力发展水平，而且也需要有新的、更高的共产主义觉悟水平。对人们进行共产主义的教育，用对共产主义思想无限忠诚的精神来教育他们，便是现在首要的基本的工作。但共产主义觉悟发展方面的任何进一步的前进，是与反对人们意识中旧东西的残余的斗争的尖锐化及与进一步克服这些残余不可分地相联系的。
    与此同时，社会主义社会发展的成绩及其向共产主义前进的成绩，使国外的社会主义敌人愈来愈发愤怒了。他们认为共产主义建设在苏联的成绩，就是各资本主义国家劳动人民的危险的（从他们的观点看）范例。这一范例能使人民大众革命，鼓舞他们去为自己的解放而斗争。苏维埃社会制度的成长了的、特别是在第二次世界大战后成长了的威信（苏维埃社会制度证明了自己的不可克服的活力与力量），便说明了国外反动力量目前对苏维埃社会主义制度与对苏维埃人民所采取的旨在削弱社会主义地位的诽谤运动。加紧进行反对民主进步力量的斗争、对苏联抱有特殊恶意的国外反动派，现在正在努力、而且将来也将努力在我国那些在与反动资产阶级思想进行斗争时受锻炼最少的分子之间寻找支柱，正在努力使旧东西在这些人的意识中复活。
    这一切要求着进行反对人们意识中的旧东西残余、反对反动资产阶级思想的敌视影响的攻势斗争。
    布尔什维克的批评与自我批评的意义，并首先在于：它的目的在揭露这些敌视影响并坚决予以克服。
    建立一个完善的共产主义社会这一伟大事业的复杂性，要求着全体苏维埃人民尽其最大努力，经常进行自我教育与自我训练，坚决驱逐一切已腐化、已死亡与已落伍的东西，与社会主义的敌人进行有步骤的不懈怠的斗争。为了胜利地解决苏维埃人民的伟大任务，全体苏维埃人民都必需提高对自己的要求，必需进行不倦的、布尔什维克的自我批评。
    布尔什维克的批评与自我批评，乃是列宁、斯大林党的考验过的武器。列宁、斯大林党使这一武器为胜利地进行共产主义建设而服务。布尔什维克的批评与自我批评，乃是苏维埃社会发展的真正动力。
