Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 6th: The inaugural meeting of the Shanghai Branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association was held on the evening of the 3rd in the auditorium of the former Central Research Institute, attended by 463 representatives from all walks of life. The meeting established the Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, electing Chen Yi, Rao Shushi, Yen Hui-ching, Pan Hannian, Liu Changsheng, Chen Wangdao, Wu Youxun, Mei Lanfang, Sheng Pihua, and others, 52 in total, as members of the Preparatory Committee. Yen Hui-ching was elected as the Director of the Preparatory Committee, Pan Hannian as the First Deputy Director, and Chen Wangdao as the Second Deputy Director. Rao Shushi, Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, pointed out in his speech at the meeting: The enthusiastic response of the people of Shanghai to the establishment of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association fully demonstrates that strengthening and consolidating the friendship between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union is a universal demand of all the people of Shanghai and even all of China. This is not accidental, but a conclusion reached by the Chinese people from more than 30 years of personal experience. He said: "The establishment of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association is to further consolidate Sino-Soviet friendship and learn from the Soviet people's experience in all aspects of revolution and construction. The friendship and unity between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union is a guarantee for the victory of the Chinese revolution and also a guarantee for the successful construction of the new China. Strengthening and consolidating the friendship between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union is also strengthening and consolidating the world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, which is conducive to overcoming the threat of a new war and striving for democracy and lasting peace in the world." Sun Xiaocun, Sheng Pihua, Mao Qihua, Guo Huaruo, Hu Feng, Li Chang, and others also spoke at the meeting. The conference also unanimously approved sending telegrams of respect to Marshal Stalin and Chairman Mao respectively.

Telegram of Respect to Chairman Mao:
Respected Chairman Mao:
    For over a hundred years, numerous patriots in China have struggled for the independence and freedom of the motherland. Only you and the Communist Party of China, twenty-eight years ago, found the correct path for the Chinese revolution. For twenty-eight years, under your leadership and that of the CPC, the Chinese people have endured countless hardships, overcome various difficulties, and finally basically completed the great cause of the people's democratic revolution. From now on, the Chinese people will forever break free from the shackles of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and open up a bright future for building their own New Democratic country. You brilliantly summarized the fruitful and valuable experience of the twenty-eight years of revolution on July 1st of this year, and pointed out a truth: For the revolution to be victorious, it must lean to one side, to the side of socialist Soviet Union; to consolidate the victory, it must also lean to one side. This instruction of yours illuminates a road to revolutionary victory and peaceful construction for the Chinese people and the people of the world. We vow to follow this path forward. Therefore, we enthusiastically respond to the call of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association recently initiated in Beiping, and initiate the organization of a branch in Shanghai, to fight for the development and consolidation of the deep friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union, against imperialism, and for lasting world peace. We hereby send our respectful greetings.

    【新华社上海六日电】中苏友好协会上海分会发起人大会于三日晚在前中央研究院大礼堂举行，到各界代表四百六十三人。会上成立了中苏友好协会上海分会筹备委员会，选出陈毅、饶漱石、颜惠庆、潘汉年、刘长胜、陈望道、吴有训、梅兰芳、盛丕华等五十二人为筹委会委员，并推选颜惠庆为筹委会主任委员，潘汉年为第一副主任委员、陈望道为第二副主任委员。中共上海市委书记饶漱石在会上讲话中指出：上海各界人民对发起成立中苏友好协会的热烈响应，充分表现了加强与巩固中苏两大民族的友谊是全上海以至全中国人民普遍的要求。这并不是偶然的，这是中国人民从三十多年亲身体念中所获得的结论。他说：“成立中苏友好协会就是为了进一步巩固中苏友谊，并学习苏联人民在革命与建设的各方面经验。中苏两大民族的友谊和团结是中国革命胜利的保证，同时也是新中国建设成功的保证。加强与巩固中苏两大民族的友谊，同时也就是加强与巩固以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵线，有利于克服新的战争威胁，争取全世界的民主与持久和平”。此外在会上讲话的尚有孙晓村、盛丕华、毛齐华、郭化若、胡风、李昌等。大会并一致通过分别致电斯大林大元帅和毛主席致敬。
    【新华社上海六日电】中苏友好协会上海分会发起人大会通过向斯大林大元帅及毛主席致敬电，两电电如文下：
    向斯大林大元帅致敬电斯大林大元帅：
    我们解放后的上海各界人民代表于九月三日发起成立中苏友好协会上海分会。大会一致对您和您所领导的伟大苏联所给予中国人民的深厚友谊和帮助表示感谢。我们认为加强中苏两国人民友谊团结，是世界持久和平的可靠保证。中苏两国人民友谊万岁！

    一九四九年九月三日
    向毛主席致敬电敬爱的毛主席：
    百余年来中国多少志士仁人曾为祖国的独立自由而奋斗，只有你和中国共产党于二十八年前才为中国革命找到了正确的道路。二十八年来，中国人民在你和中共领导之下，历经万苦千辛，克服了种种困难，终于在基本上完成了人民民主革命的大业。从此，中国人民将永远打脱帝国主义、封建主义与官僚资本主义的枷锁，开辟了建设自己的新民主主义国家的光明前途。你在本年七月一日英明地总结了二十八年来革命的丰硕宝贵的经验，指示了一个真理：革命要胜利，必须一边倒，倒向社会主义苏联的一边：胜利了要巩固，也必须一边倒。你这一指示，向中国人民和全世界人民照耀出一条革命胜利与和平建设的大道，我们誓必遵循着这条道路前进。因此，我们热烈响应最近在北平发起组织的中苏友好协会的号召，在上海发起组织分会，为发展和巩固中苏两国人民的深厚友谊，为反对帝国主义，为争取世界永久和平而斗争。特此肃电致敬。
