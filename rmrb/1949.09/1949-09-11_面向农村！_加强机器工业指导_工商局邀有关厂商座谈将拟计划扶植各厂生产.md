　　Focusing on the Countryside!
　　Strengthening Guidance for the Machine Industry.
　　Industry and Commerce Bureau Invites Relevant Manufacturers to Discuss and Formulate Plans to Support Factory Production.
　　[This City News] In order to systematically guide the production of the machine industry and to focus on the countryside, the Industry and Commerce Bureau held symposiums with manufacturers of electric grinders, waterwheels, etc., on the 9th (yesterday) and 10th (today). More than 40 manufacturers of electric grinders, rice threshers, rice milling machines, cotton gins, and cotton gins not only explained the current production and sales situation in detail, but also unanimously expressed their willingness to cooperate in production and sales under the leadership of the government to carry out planned production. The electric grinders and rice milling machines produced by the industry do not sell well because the grain and flour processing industry in this city has developed considerably, and there is no need to add more. At the same time, the countryside lacks electricity and cannot use electric grinders and rice milling machines. However, rice threshing, cotton ginning, and cotton ginning can be done by manpower machines, which have a future in the countryside and meet the needs of farmers. For example, the rice threshers produced by factories such as Huadong, Fuxing, and Xinfu in this city are often purchased by farmers in the suburbs and Zhuoxian, and they sell very well. However, the promotion scope is very small, and farmers in other counties do not know about it. The Industry and Commerce Bureau plans to vigorously promote these machines that are beneficial to farmers and is preparing to formulate plans to support factory production and serve the countryside. More than 20 manufacturers of waterwheels admitted in the symposium that most of the more than 1,000 waterwheels contracted to the North China Water Conservancy Promotion Society were delivered late and of poor quality. After the staff of the Industry and Commerce Bureau explained that the production of waterwheels is to develop agriculture, and that farmers currently lack scientific knowledge, if they use waterwheels of poor quality, they will not be able to repair them when they are broken. At the same time, if they break down soon after installation, it will also affect farmers' interest in using machines and directly hinder the improvement of agricultural production. Therefore, everyone should improve according to the opinions of farmers after actual use, and not "build cars behind closed doors." The manufacturers spoke enthusiastically and discussed how to improve the methods. They unanimously proposed that it is best to set standard waterwheels, with each factory cooperating in division of labor, some specializing in pipes, some specializing in chains, some specializing in sand casting, and some specializing in assembly, so that each factory can become skilled, work quickly, and reduce costs. In addition, the factories also pointed out that the pipes of this waterwheel are not good, and tools for making pipes should be developed instead of manual work, so that the specifications and quality can be uniform. The Industry and Commerce Bureau attaches great importance to these opinions and will study them together with the North China Water Conservancy Promotion Society. It is also scheduled to continue to convene manufacturers of iron shovels, large carts, axles, looms, and hosiery machines for discussion tomorrow (12th).

　  加强机器工业指导
    工商局邀有关厂商座谈将拟计划扶植各厂生产
    【本市讯】工商局为有计划地指导机器工业生产，面向农村，前（九）昨（十）两日分别与制造电磨、水车等厂商举行座谈会。制造电磨、打稻机、碾米机、弹花机、轧花机等四十余厂商除详细说明目前产销情况外，并一致表示愿在政府领导下，使产销配合，进行有计划的生产。该业所产电磨、碾米机销路欠佳，因本市各粮面加工业已有相当发展，没有再多添置的必要，同时农村缺乏电力，不能使用电磨和碾米机。而打稻、轧花、弹花可造人力机，在农村有出路，适合农民需要。象本市华东、复兴、信孚等厂所产打稻机，平郊和涿县农民常来购买，销路很好。不过，推销范围很小，其他各县农民还不知道。工商局拟将这些有益农民的机器大力推广，准备订出计划扶植各厂生产，服务于农村。制造水车厂商二十余家在座谈中，承认最近给华北水利推进社承制的一千余辆水车，大部延期交货，品质不好。经工商局人员说明，生产水车是为发展农业，现在农民科学知识尚极缺乏，若使用品质不好的水车，坏了不会修理，同时若按装不久就坏，也影响农民使用机器的兴趣，直接妨碍农业生产的提高。所以大家应根据农民实际使用后的意见来改进，不要“闭门造车”。各厂商纷纷发言，热烈讨论怎样改进办法，一致提出最好订出标准水车，各厂分工合作，有的专做管子，有的专做练子，有的专翻砂，有的专代装，使各厂技术熟，做活快，成本低。此外，各厂并提出这次水车管子不好，应该研究出专造管子的工具，不用手工，规格品质就可划一。工商局很重视这些意见，将和华北水利推进社共同研究。并定于明（十二）日继续召集制造铁锨、大车、车轴、织布机、织袜机等厂商座谈。
