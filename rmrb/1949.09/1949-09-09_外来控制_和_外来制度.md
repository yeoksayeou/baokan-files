　　"Foreign Control" and "Foreign System"
　　Xing Zongjiang
    In the conclusion of Acheson's letter to Truman, there is the following paragraph: "We continue to believe that... China's long civilization and democratic individualism will eventually rise again, and China will eventually overthrow the foreign system..." Acheson's intention in making this statement is to use the malicious propaganda of "foreign control" and "foreign system" to slander the Chinese people's cause of liberation and the socialist Soviet Union. At the same time, he established his "arrogant belief" and determined his "work goals" on this basis! This is one of the most important points in the US State Department White Paper, so we must severely refute it to set the record straight!
    Acheson's slander of "foreign control" and "foreign system" fully exposes his deception and ignorance! Therefore, his "belief" and "goals" are nothing but fantasies! No matter how hard he tries and works, it is all in vain.
    Acheson's so-called "foreign control" is a claim that the Chinese Communist Party is "serving" and being "controlled" by the Soviet Union. This is a blatant lie that turns black and white! In fact, since the October Revolution, the Soviet Union has never interfered in China's internal affairs, and has never provided the CCP with material support during the People's Liberation War. This is an ironclad fact, which even the US imperialists have never denied. As for the CCP's policy of "leaning to one side" towards the world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, it is a concrete manifestation of proletarian internationalism and an inevitable measure in the struggle against the anti-people and anti-democratic camp headed by the US imperialists. Moreover, in this policy, the relationship between China and the Soviet Union is entirely based on genuine equality and mutual assistance. But on the other hand, in the 109 years of Sino-US relations (starting from the Opium War of 1840, a collaboration between Britain and the US), the US imperialists have consistently, in the spirit of "traditional friendship with China," constantly made this or that "urge" and "wish" regarding China's internal affairs. And this "friend" is so "enthusiastic" that when his "well-intentioned" "urges" and "wishes" cannot be realized, he becomes furious! In the past three years, the US imperialists have provided massive military and economic assistance and guidance to the reactionary Kuomintang government, hoping to realize their own "wish": to defeat the Chinese people's revolutionary forces in order to maintain their exclusive control over China. This is also an ironclad fact, and the US State Department White Paper is a naked confession of its aggression against China! The Chinese people, with their "long civilization," still have a clear enough mind to distinguish which country is imposing "foreign control" on them and in what way!
    Acheson also claims that Marxism-Leninism and the people's democratic dictatorship system currently implemented in China are so-called "foreign systems." This is indeed an ignorant fallacy! In the past thirty years, the socialist revolution in the Soviet Union and the new democratic revolutions in Eastern European countries and China have fully confirmed the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism! According to the inevitable laws of social development, socialism and communism are destined to be the future of all mankind. Therefore, this is the "common system" of all nations in the future! If the US imperialists insist on claiming that this is a "foreign system," then such a "foreign system" will inevitably be imposed on them in the future. Furthermore, China's current people's democratic dictatorship is an important part of Mao Zedong Thought. It is not a formulaic imitation of Marxism-Leninism, but a product of the integration of Marxism-Leninism with China's specific revolutionary practice. For example, the social and material living conditions in Russia in 1917 determined the nature of its socialist revolution. And the social and material living conditions in our country at the present stage determine the nature of the new democratic revolution. The great Mao Zedong Thought is the application of Marxism-Leninism, making it suitable for China's specific conditions and China's national form. Therefore, Mao Zedong Thought is rooted among the Chinese people and is supported by the people of the whole country. Acheson, the spokesman of the US imperialists, actually stared at us and gave us a so-called "foreign system" hat, while stubbornly assigning their own so-called "democratic individualism" system as China's "own system" and believing that it "will eventually rise again"! It is a pity that the Chinese people with their "long civilization" can clearly recognize what is our "own system"—this can be seen from the fact that our people of the whole country reject what system and adopt what system today. Today, our people across the country are telling this "well-intentioned" "friend" not to worry, we wholeheartedly support the system of people's democratic dictatorship and resolutely reject the system of "democratic individualism"!

### “外来控制”和“外来制度”

　　“外来控制”和“外来制度”
    刑宗江
    艾奇逊在给杜鲁门的信的结尾中，有下面这样一段话：“我们继续相信，……中国的悠久文明和民主个人主义终将再起，中国终将推翻外来制度。……”艾奇逊讲这段话的用意，是想用“外来控制”和“外来制度”的恶毒宣传，来诬蔑中国人民的解放事业，和社会主义的苏联。同时就在这个基础上，建立了他的“狂妄信念”，并确立了他的“工作目标”！这是美帝白皮书中的一个最重要之点，因此我们要予以严厉的驳斥，以正视听！
    艾奇逊所谓的“外来控制”和“外来制度”的诬蔑，充分暴露出他的欺骗和无知！因此他的“信念”和“目标”，都不过是一种幻想！无论他怎样的努力和工作，都是枉费心机的。
    艾奇逊所谓的“外来控制”，是宣称中国共产党是为苏联“效力”并受其“控制”的。这是一个颠倒黑白的天大的谎！事实上，苏联自从十月革命以后，从不过问中国的内政，在人民解放战争期间，从未予中共以物质支援。这是铁一般的事实，就连美帝也不曾否认过。至于中共的“一面倒”向以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营的政策，则是无产阶级的国际主义的具体表现，也是与以美帝为首的反人民反民主的阵营作斗争中的必然措施。并且在这个政策中，中苏关系是完全建立在真正的平等与互助的基础之上的。但是另一方面，一百零九年（从一八四○年英美合作的鸦片战争算起）的中美关系中，美帝是一贯地在“对华传统友谊”的精神下，对中国内政不断地提出这般或那样的“敦促”和“愿望”。并且这位“朋友”还是如此“热心”，以致在他“好心”的“敦促”和“愿望”不能实现时，就要大发雷霆！近三年来，美帝更在军事和经济方面大量援助并指导反动的国民党政府，希图实现他自己的“愿望”：就是打败中国人民革命的力量，以维持他对中国的独占统治的地位。这也是铁一般的事实，美帝白皮书就是一篇自己赤裸裸的侵华供状！有着“悠久文明”的中国人民，是尚有足够清晰的头脑来分辨出“外来控制”是由那个国家、用怎样方式来加诸己身的！
    艾奇逊又宣称马列主义之于中国与中国现阶段所实行的人民民主专政的制度是所谓“外来制度”。这实在是个无知的谬说！近三十多年，苏联的社会主义革命与东欧各国及中国的新民主主义革命，已然完全证实了马列主义的普遍真理！社会主义与共产主义，根据社会发展的必然规律，已经注定了是全人类的前途。因此这是未来全世界民族的“共同制度”！如果美帝国主义者必欲坚持主张这是“外来制度”的话，那么，这样的“外来制度”，在将来也一定不可避免的要加诸于他们之身的。再进一步来说，中国现在的人民民主专政，是毛泽东思想的一个重要部分。这并不是公式的抄袭马列主义，而是将马列主义与中国具体的革命实践互相结合起来的产物。比如一九一七年俄国的社会物质生活条件，就决定了他的社会主义革命的性质。而现阶段我国的社会物质生活条件，则决定了新民主主义革命的性质。伟大的毛泽东思想，是应用马列主义，使其适合于中国的具体情况与中国的民族形式。所以毛泽东思想是生根在中国人民中间，而得到全国人民的拥护。美帝的发言人艾奇逊，竟瞪着眼给我们送上一顶所谓“外来制度”的帽子，同时却硬将他们自己的所谓“民主个人主义”的制度派定为我们中国的“自有制度”，并相信其“终将再起”！可惜有着“悠久文明”的中国人民是可以清清楚楚地认识到什么是我们“自己的制度”的—这从今天我们全国人民拒绝了什么制度与采取了什么制度的事实中就可以表现出来。今天我们全国人民正告这位“好心”的“朋友”不劳关切了，我们都是全心拥护人民民主专政的制度，而坚决唾弃“民主个人主义”的制度！
