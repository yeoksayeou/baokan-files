How Much Should We Eat?
    Peng Dahui
    Our bodies need a certain amount of energy to maintain body temperature and drive work. The source of this energy is the food we eat every day. Food undergoes chemical changes in the human body, generating a certain amount of energy. One gram of protein, after being broken down in the human body, has four calories of heat (calorie is the unit of heat energy); one gram of sugar also has four calories of heat; and one gram of fat has nine calories of heat. Because the composition of food is different, the amount of heat generated is also different.
    The amount of calories each person needs per day varies depending on gender, age, the intensity of labor, and weight. In 1939, the Chinese Medical Association stipulated that the minimum heat requirement for an adult weighing one kilogram per hour is 40 calories; if there is work, it should be appropriately increased according to the intensity of the work. According to this standard, the amount of calories needed for various types of workers can be roughly calculated as follows:
    Men (weighing 60 kg) Daily Calorie Needs:
    　　Light work (writing, reading, sewing, making leather shoes, etc.) 2500 calories
    　　Moderate work (carpentry, bricklaying, painting, students, driving cars, etc.) 3000 calories
    　　Heavy work (farming, riding horses, mechanical craftsmen, running, peacetime commanders and fighters, etc.) 3500 calories
    　　Very heavy work (miners, ironworkers, stoneworkers, mountain climbing, wartime commanders and fighters, etc.) 4000-4500 calories
    Women (weighing 50 kg):
    　　Light work (female office workers, telephone drivers, clothing workers, etc.) 2100 calories
    　　Moderate work (cooking, students, teachers, cycling, salespersons, etc.) 2500 calories
    　　Heavy work (laundry, farming, carrying water, etc.) 3000 calories
    Pregnant women 2500 calories
    Lactating women 3000 calories
    If a normal person obtains more calories from food each day than the body consumes, the person's weight should increase. Conversely, if the calories obtained from food are not enough to supply the body's consumption, the weight will decrease, and the spirit will be tired and depressed.
    Breaking it down further, of course, we must also consider protein, fat, minerals, and vitamins, but the important thing is to first look at the supply of calories.
    From an economic point of view, we should choose cheap foods with high caloric value. Below is a simple table of the caloric value of common foods in Peiping (Beijing). According to this table, you can estimate whether the things you eat every day can supply your work needs, and you can roughly know if you are eating enough.
    Note: One jin equals five hundred grams (see table)
    The above table tells us:
    (1) Coarse grains are not only cheaper than refined grains, but they also provide the same amount of calories as refined grains.
    (2) Although vegetable oil and animal oil have different prices, the amount of energy supplied is the same.
    (3) Although the price of white sugar and brown sugar differs greatly, the calories of the two are almost the same.

　　应当吃多少才好呢？
    彭大惠
    我们的身体需要一定量的热能，来保持体温和推动工作。这热能的来源，就是每天所吃的食物，食物在人体中经过化学变化后，发生一定量的热能。一公分蛋白质，在人体中分解后有四卡的热量（卡是热能的单位）；一公分糖，也有四卡的热量；一公分脂肪有九卡的热量。因为食物的成分不同，发生的热量也就不等。
    每人每天需要的热量，因性别、年龄、劳动的强度和体重而不同，民国二十八年中华医学会规定：成年人体重每公斤每小时最低热力需要量为四十卡；如有工作则按工作之轻重再酌加。按照这个标准来计算各种不同工作者需要的热量，大概如下：男人（体重六十公斤）　每日需要热量轻度工作（写字、读书、缝衣、做皮鞋等）　二五○○卡中度工作（木工、泥水工、油漆工、学生、开汽车等）　三○○○卡重度工作（耕田、骑马、机械工匠、跑步、平时指战员等）　三五○○卡极重工作（矿工、铁工、石工、爬山、战时指战员等）　四○○○——四
　五○○卡女人（体重五十公斤）    轻度工作（女职员、电话司机、被服工等）　二一○○卡中度工作（煮饭、学生、教员、骑车、售货员等）　二五○○卡重量工作（洗衣、耕田、担水等）　　三○○○卡孕妇　二五○○卡乳妇　三○○○卡
    一个正常的人每天由食物中所得的热量如多于每天身体的消耗，这人的体重就应该增加，反之，由食物中所得的热量不足供给身体的消耗，体重就会减少，精神也会疲劳不振。
    细分起来看，当然还要顾到蛋白质、脂肪、矿物质和维生素等，不过重要的先要看热量的供给。
    从经济上来说，我们应该选择价廉而热量高的食物，下面是一张北平市普通食品的热量简表，按照这表可以估计一下每天你所吃的东西能不能供给你工作的需要，就大概可以知道你吃的够不够。附注：一斤等于五百公分（附图表）
    上面的表告诉我们：
    （一）粗粮不但比细粮价贱，而且与细粮供给同等的热量。
    （二）晕油和素油虽然价格不同，但是热能的供给量是相同的。
    （三）白糖和红糖价虽相差很多，可是两者的热量是不相上下。
