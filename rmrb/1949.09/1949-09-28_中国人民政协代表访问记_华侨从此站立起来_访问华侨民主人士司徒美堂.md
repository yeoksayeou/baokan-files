　　Record of Visits with Representatives of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference
  　Overseas Chinese Stand Up From Now On
    ——An Interview with Overseas Chinese Democratic Figure Situ Meitang
    Lin Hong
    One bright morning, I visited Mr. Situ Meitang, an 83-year-old democratic figure from the Americas.

    His first words were: I have lived the life of an overseas Chinese in the Americas for more than sixty years. I have waited so long, and only now have I seen the true emergence of a new China. The joy in my heart is indescribable. For many years, overseas Chinese have been like orphans abroad, uncared for and subjected to bullying and insult by imperialist countries. Therefore, we have constantly hoped that our country could also become strong, and we have supported domestic revolutions in various ways, all to achieve this wish. But we have been disappointed many times. Today, thanks to the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the reactionary Chiang Kai-shek regime has been overthrown, and the forces of American and British imperialism have been driven out of our country. With the victorious opening of the People's Political Consultative Conference, the new Central People's Government is about to be established, and the new Common Program clearly stipulates that the interests of overseas Chinese will be effectively protected. When we see these new scenes, only those who have suffered all kinds of oppression can imagine our joyful mood. Speaking of this, Mr. Situ Meitang particularly cited two examples. He said: Recently, two things have made overseas Chinese feel very excited. From these two things, we can see how much the overseas Chinese love the new China. The first thing is that when the People's Liberation Army victoriously crossed the Yangtze River, British imperialist warships attempted to interfere in China's internal affairs and directly helped the Kuomintang to stop the People's Liberation Army from advancing, but it immediately received a strong response from the Chinese people. Our People's Liberation Army, in order to defend the sacred territory, bravely opened fire to counterattack, and finally made the British imperialists flee in panic. Another thing is that the American Consul in Shanghai, Oliver, violated Chinese law and apologized to the Chinese people. After these two things were reported to the United States, the overseas Chinese all cheered and celebrated enthusiastically, all feeling that this was truly a breath of fresh air for the Chinese people. Mr. Situ said: I haven't drunk alcohol in more than twenty years, but those two things made me so happy that I got drunk.

    When the reporter asked about the situation of the overseas Chinese in the Americas, Mr. Situ Meitang said: The overseas Chinese in the Americas all have high hopes for the People's Government. Having suffered enough from the Kuomintang's deception, the overseas Chinese are very hateful of the Chiang Kai-shek regime. What particularly dissatisfies the overseas Chinese is the Kuomintang reactionary government's exchange policy, which has caused great losses to the overseas Chinese and their families. Before and after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, in addition to donating money to help the "motherland," the overseas Chinese also purchased a large number of US dollar bonds issued by the Kuomintang, but as a result, the US dollar bonds were worthless, and the overseas Chinese suffered great losses. Today, this situation has changed, and the overseas Chinese are willing to help the construction of the motherland with redoubled enthusiasm. I plan to go to the Northeast after the CPPCC meeting to provide some materials for the future investment of overseas Chinese in the construction of the motherland.

    Mr. Situ Meitang finally said to the reporter: For more than a hundred years, the Chinese people at home and abroad have suffered enough from the bullying of imperialism. Today, I can see the Chinese people stand up and exist in the world as an independent nation. My lifelong wish has been fulfilled. After completely overthrowing the Kuomintang reactionary regime, the construction of the new country will still encounter some difficulties, but the previous difficulties have been overcome, creating today's victorious situation. We have the confidence to overcome any future difficulties. As long as the people of the whole country are closely united around the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, under their wise leadership, we will definitely be able to overcome any difficulties and build a free and happy country. This is what I personally firmly believe.

    Mr. Situ Meitang's ancestral home is in Guangdong. He left the country for the United States at the age of fourteen, and participated in the "Overthrow the Qing Dynasty and Restore the Ming Dynasty" movement at the age of seventeen. Before and after the Revolution of 1911, he actively assisted, especially in providing financial assistance to Mr. Sun Yat-sen to engage in revolutionary activities. During the Anti-Japanese War, he raised funds in the name of the fundraising bureau to support the war. In 1941, after the Southern Anhui Incident, Mr. Situ personally sent a telegram opposing the Kuomintang's destruction of the anti-Japanese national united front, opposing the massacre of communists and patriots, and launched overseas Chinese groups to send telegrams of opposition. In 1948, he refused to attend the pseudo-National Assembly.

　　中国人民政协代表访问记
  　华侨从此站立起来
    ——访问华侨民主人士司徒美堂
    林洪
    一个晴朗的清晨，我访问美洲华侨民主人士八十三岁的司徒美堂先生。
    他第一句话便说：我在美洲度着侨居的生活已有六十多年的历史，好容易盼到今天，才看到新中国的真正出现，我心里的高兴是无法形容的。多少年来，华侨在国外象孤儿一样无人照管，受尽了帝国主义国家的欺凌和侮辱，因此我们无时无刻不在盼望自己的国家也能强盛起来，随时以各种各样的方式资助国内的革命，都是为了达到这一愿望。但是我们多少次都失望了。今天由于中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导，打倒了反动的蒋介石政权，而且将美英等帝国主义的势力赶出了我们的国境，随着人民政协的胜利开幕，新的中央人民政府便要成立，新的共同纲领中更明白地规定将切实保护华侨的利益，当我们看到这一些新的情景时，我们欢喜的心情只有曾经饱受各种压迫的人才能想象得到。司徒美堂先生说到这里时，他特别高兴地举出了两件例子。他说：最近有两件事情让华侨十分感到兴奋，从这两件事情中，我们就可以看到华侨对新中国是多么的热爱。第一件事情是当人民解放军胜利渡江的时候，英帝国主义的兵舰妄图干涉中国内战，直接帮助国民党阻止人民解放军前进，但它立刻得到中国人民有力的回答，我们人民解放军为了维护神圣的国土，便英勇地开炮加以还击，终于使英帝国主义者狼狈而逃。另外一件事情，就是美国驻沪领事奥立佛违犯中国法律，向中国人民道歉。这两件事传到美国后，华侨们无不连声称快，大家都开会热烈庆祝，都觉得这是真正为中国人民出了一口气。司徒先生说：我有二十多年没有喝酒，那两次事情实在让我太高兴了，我也就喝醉了。
    当记者问到美洲华侨的情形时，司徒美堂先生说：美洲华侨对人民政府都抱着热烈的希望。因为受够了国民党的欺骗，华侨对蒋介石政权都十分憎恨。尤其是让华侨不满意的就是国民党反动政府所施行的侨汇政策，使华侨和他的家庭都吃了很大亏。抗战胜利前后，华侨除去捐款帮助“祖国”还大量购买国民党发行的美金公债，但结果美金公债不值钱，华侨受了很大的损失。今天这种局面改变了，华侨愿以加倍的热情来帮助祖国的建设。我打算政协会议后去东北一行，以便对将来华侨投资祖国的建设事业提供一些材料。
    司徒美堂先生最后向记者说：一百多年来，中国人在国内和国外都受够了帝国主义的欺侮，今天能看见中国人民站立起来，作为一个独立的民族存在于世界，我这一生的愿望算是达到了。在完全打倒国民党反动政权后，新国家的建设还会遇到一些困难，但以前的困难都克服了，创造出今天胜利的局面，我们就有信心克服今后的任何困难。只要全国人民紧紧地团结在共产党和毛主席的周围，在他们英明的领导下，我们一定能够渡过任何难关，建立起一个自由幸福的国家，这是我个人坚决相信的。
    司徒美堂先生原籍广东，十四岁离国赴美，十七岁就参加“反清复明”运动。辛亥革命前后，曾积极协助，尤其是以金钱接济孙中山先生从事革命运动，抗日战争时期复以筹饷局名义募款支持抗战。一九四一年皖南事变发生，司徒先生曾以个人名义通电反对国民党破坏抗日民族统一战线，反对屠杀共产党员和爱国人士，并发动海外侨团通电反对。一九四八年他曾拒绝出席伪国民大会。
