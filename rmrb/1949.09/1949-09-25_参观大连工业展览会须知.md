　　Notice for Visiting the Dalian Industrial Exhibition

　　[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The Dalian Travel Service, in order to assist visitors from all over the country to the Dalian Industrial Exhibition in resolving issues related to food, lodging, and transportation, has recently established "Visitor's Guide to the Industrial Exhibition." Excerpts are as follows:

　　(1) Visitors from outside the city should notify the agency (Dalian Travel Service, the same below) of the number of visitors and the estimated time of arrival in the city before departure, so that we can introduce arrangements for food, lodging, and transportation in a planned manner. (2) All expenses for food, lodging, transportation, and luggage for visitors from outside the city shall be borne by themselves. Those departing after mid-October should prepare more clothing. (3) Travel permits for visitors from outside the city should be issued by the governments above the city and county level, marked with "Visiting the Industrial Exhibition" or "Industrial Exhibition Visiting Group" for easy identification by traffic posts. Visitors only need to bring letters of introduction from city, county, Party, government, and organizations. No other procedures are required. (4) The time required to visit the Industrial Exhibition is generally about three to five days. (5) Visitors from various places shall not exchange more than 10,000 Kwartung Currency per person, but the exchange can be increased or decreased according to the number of days of the visit. Gold and silver carried shall be sold or kept in custody by the Kwartung Bank. (6) Foreign currencies carried by visitors from outside the city, except for the amount exchanged according to regulations, shall be deposited in the Kwartung Bank for safekeeping, and a receipt shall be obtained. The currencies can be withdrawn upon presentation of the receipt after the visit. (7) The exchange rate for foreign currencies shall be based on the quotation of the Kwartung Bank. (8) The exchange of currencies for visiting groups shall be arranged by the agency to the Kwartung Bank. Visitors from within the customs who pass through the Northeast should first exchange their Renminbi for Northeast Currency. However, passengers arriving in Dalian by sea can exchange through the agency. (9) Visitors from outside the city will be given preferential treatment for food, lodging, bathing, and haircuts. In terms of food expenses, three meals a day of refined grains are divided into three standards: 400, 600, and 900 Kwartung Currency per person, which visitors can choose themselves. Accommodation fee: 60 Renminbi per person with their own bedding, and 110 Renminbi without bedding. The agency is responsible for introducing accommodation addresses. (10) It is hoped that organs and organizations in various regions will come to visit in an organized manner. Those who come to visit with letters of introduction will be assisted by the agency in handling food, lodging, transportation, and other matters.
