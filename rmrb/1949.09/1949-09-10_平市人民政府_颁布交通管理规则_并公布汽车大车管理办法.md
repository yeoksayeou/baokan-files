[News from this city] Before the liberation of Peiping, traffic order was extremely chaotic. Due to the reckless driving of automobiles by American imperialists and the Kuomintang bandit army on the streets, traffic accidents occurred several times a day. The injured were left unattended, and the dead had nowhere to appeal. After liberation, the Municipal People's Government made considerable efforts to rectify traffic order, such as reorganizing street vendors, etc. However, although traffic accidents have decreased, they still occur from time to time. According to statistics from the Public Security Bureau, a total of 218 traffic accidents occurred from February to August. The causes of the accidents were mostly due to careless driving (accounting for 89 cases) or mutual carelessness (accounting for 57 cases). A total of 184 people were injured and 24 people died in traffic accidents. The losses caused by traffic accidents amounted to approximately 15,506 jin of millet (excluding medical expenses for the injured and funeral expenses and compensation for the deceased). Therefore, in order to ensure the safety of citizens and more effectively manage traffic order, the Municipal People's Government has specially formulated the "Provisional Traffic Management Regulations for Peiping Municipality," "Provisional Automobile Management Regulations for Peiping Municipality," "Provisional Automobile Trade Management Regulations for Peiping Municipality," "Provisional Automobile Driver Management Regulations for Peiping Municipality," and "Peiping Municipal Cart Traffic Management Regulations" and other regulations (all of which can be found in the advertisement column of this newspaper), which are officially promulgated and implemented today (the 10th) and will be earnestly enforced by the Public Security Bureau. It is hoped that all citizens will jointly abide by the various regulations and establish a good traffic order in the people's capital.

　　平市人民政府
  　颁布交通管理规则
  　并公布汽车大车管理办法
    【本市讯】北平解放以前，交通秩序极乱，由于美帝国主义者及国民党匪军的汽车在街道上横冲直撞，车祸一日数起，伤者无人管照，死者无处申诉。解放后，本市人民政府对交通秩序的整顿，曾作了不少工作，如整理摊贩等等，但是车祸虽已减少，而仍不免时有发生，据公安局的统计，二月至八月的车祸共二一八起，肇事原因多半是驾驶不慎（占八十九起）或双方不慎（占五十七起），因车祸而受伤者共一八四人，死亡者二十四人，因车祸而遭的损失约合小米一五、五○六斤（受伤人的医药费及死亡者的抬埋费，抚恤金尚不在内）。因此，为了保证市民安全，更有效地管理交通秩序，本市人民政府特制订“北平市交通管理暂行规则”、“北平市汽车管理暂行规则”、“北平汽车行管理暂行规则”、“北平市汽车驾驶人管理暂行规则”和“北平市大车行驶管理规则”等各种条规（均见本报广告栏），于今（十）日正式公布实施，并由公安局切实执行。希全体市民共同遵守各项规定，建立起人民首都良好的交通秩序。
