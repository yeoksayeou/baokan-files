　　Breaking the Blockade and Relying on Our Own Efforts
  　Shanghai Zhongfang No. 3 Factory
  　Successfully Switches to Domestic Raw Materials
  　Shanghai Steel Company and Zhentai Rubber Factory Conduct Careful Research
  　Achieving Remarkable Results in Modifying Machines and Switching to Raw Materials
    [Special Dispatch from Our Shanghai Correspondent, 4th] In order to smash the enemy's blockade and break away from economic dependence on imperialism, public and private factories in Shanghai are beginning to modify machines and switch to domestic raw materials. Zhongfang No. 3 Factory, Shanghai Steel Company's Zhonghua Iron Factory, and Zhentai Rubber Factory have achieved remarkable results. Zhongfang No. 3 Factory, after research, from August 13th, eliminated the main American cotton component of the original mixed cotton, whether it was 42-count yarn or 20-count yarn, and the production results were very good. At the same time, because the average length of domestic cotton fiber used is shorter by one-sixteenth than when American cotton was mixed, the quality remains the same, while the cost is reduced, and the production rate is also increased as a result. In terms of modifying machines and saving diesel, Shanghai Steel Company's Zhonghua Iron Factory has achieved success through careful research by engineers and workers. Shanghai Steel Company began modifying the three diesel-burning Martin open-hearth furnaces of the first and second factories to burn coal on August 19th. The No. 2 ten-ton Martin furnace of the third factory has been modified and officially produced steel from August 30th to September 1st. The condition of the four furnaces is good. Zhonghua Iron Factory tested a gas-diesel dual-fuel engine (burning a large amount of gas with a small amount of diesel), and as a result, 87% of diesel was saved, while the engine horsepower and power generation remained unchanged. According to the current market price, a 40-horsepower engine consumes about 3,000 yuan per hour when burning diesel completely. The cost of converting to gas is only 600 yuan. Moreover, when the diesel supply is insufficient, cottonseed oil, rapeseed oil, or tung oil can be used instead; this not only reduces costs, but the installation is simple, requiring only the addition of a gas generator that burns wood or charcoal. Zhentai Rubber Factory has successfully tested using tap water instead of gasoline as a paste. Shanghai's general rubber factories use gasoline as a bonding agent for rubber products, which consumes a large amount of gasoline. This factory alone needs 10,000 gallons per month. Since the enemy's blockade, the source of gasoline has been difficult and the cost is expensive. Engineer You Qiwen and Lu Danping, the director of the compounding department, based on the clues tried by the Japanese, painstakingly researched and tested the use of tap water instead of gasoline as a paste. All water-based slurry is being tested for galoshes. In terms of tires, the original gasoline paste was used, and each canvas required six applications, costing 15 gallons of gasoline. Now, it is pasted twice first, and then pressed twice with a calender (roller) together with the cloth, eliminating the need for gasoline, and the quality is just as good. The factory can now save more than 60% of gasoline per month. These reforms and inventions not only reduce costs but also overcome the difficulties brought about by the enemy's blockade, and are worthy of emulation everywhere.

　　打破封锁自力更生

  　改用国产原料成功

  　改装机器改用原料均获显著成绩
    【本报记者上海四日专电】为了粉碎敌人封锁，摆脱经济上对帝国主义的依赖，沪市公私营工厂正开始改装机器，改用国产原料。中纺三厂、上海钢铁公司中华铁工厂、正泰橡胶厂等已获显著成就。中纺三厂，经过研究后，于八月十三日起，将原来混棉成份之主要美棉，不论四十二支纱或二十支纱等，一律剔除，生产成绩很好。同时因所用国棉纤维长度平均，较混用美棉时减短十六分之一时，质量依旧，而成本则减低，生产率还因此提高。在改装机器，节省柴油方面，上海钢铁公司中华铁工厂，经工程师和工人的细心研究已获成功。上钢公司于八月十九开始第一第二两厂的三座柴油燃烧的马丁炼钢炉，改装烧煤，三厂第二号十吨马丁炉，已改装完竣，并已于三十日至九月一日正式出钢。四炉情形良好。中华铁工厂试装煤气柴油两用引擎（以小量的柴油配合大量煤气燃烧），结果省下了百分之八十七柴油，而引擎马力和发电量不变。按目前市价四十匹马力的引擎，完全用柴油燃烧，每小时消耗约为三千余元。改装煤气仅为六百元即可。并且在柴油来源不继时，可以棉花子油菜油或桐油代替；不但减低成本，而装置又简单，只添装一套烧木柴或木炭的煤气发生炉即可。以自来水代替汽油作糊浆，正泰橡胶厂已试验成功。上海一般的橡胶厂。都用汽油来作橡胶制品的结合剂，所费汽油量很大，该厂每月就需一万加仑。自敌人封锁后，汽油来源困难，成本又贵；该厂工程师尤启文和配料间主任陆丹萍，根据日本人试用过的线索，苦心研究，试验用自来水代替汽油作糊浆。套鞋方面试行全用水浆。车胎方面原用汽油糊浆，帆布每只需六次，费汽油十五加仑，现先糊二次，再用卡轮达（压车）和布一起压两次，不必再用汽油，品质一样好。现该厂每月可节省汽油百分之六十以上。诸种改革与发明，不仅成本低，且可克服敌人封锁所带来的困难，值得各地仿效。
