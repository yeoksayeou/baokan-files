Traffic Regulation Yields Results; Traffic Accidents Decrease

[This City News] The city's Public Security Bureau's efforts to regulate traffic order have achieved significant results. Traffic accidents are decreasing daily, and no major accidents have occurred. Generally, pedestrians, vehicles, and horses are able to follow traffic rules. The section of Qianmenwai Street from Zhushikou to Tianqiao was the most congested and chaotic before the regulation, but after the regulation, both fast and slow vehicles can follow the rules, and the traffic posts at both ends can see each other clearly. During the regulation period, each sub-bureau was able to cooperate appropriately with the district trade unions, district offices, and stall management offices to jointly carry out publicity and regulation work. The electric tram company's workers' propaganda vehicles and some elementary school students also voluntarily assisted in the traffic regulation publicity work. Many people not only followed traffic order themselves, but also helped with the regulation work. In order to assist in maintaining traffic order, the tricycle drivers and vendors in each district are brewing a covenant to be followed by everyone. The tricycle drivers in the inner seven districts have already formulated thirteen covenants on the sixteenth, guaranteeing that everyone will abide by them and not violate traffic rules. The traffic police officers of most sub-bureaus have shown a high degree of enthusiasm for serving the people during the regulation process. For example, the traffic police officers of the Inner Seventh Sub-bureau voluntarily stopped resting and participated in the regulation work all day long. As for the few who violated traffic rules, appropriate education or punishment has been given.

　　整理交通收效交通事故减少
    【本市讯】市公安局整理交通秩序，已获很大效果。交通事故逐日减少，重大事故更未发生。一般行人车马，尚能遵照交通规则行驶。前门外大街珠市口至天桥一段，在整理前是最拥挤最杂乱的，但在整理以后，快慢车均能遵章行驶，两头的交通岗，彼此能够很清楚的望见了。整理期间，各分局均能与各区工会，区公所，摊贩管理处等作适当配合，共同进行宣传及整理工作。电车公司工人的宣传车和部分小学校学生们，也自动的协助整理交通宣传工作。许多群众，不但自己遵守交通秩序，有的还帮助整理工作。各区的三轮车夫，摊贩等，为协助维护交通秩序，正酝酿制定公约，大家遵守，内七区的三轮车夫于十六日已订定出十三条公约，保证大家共同遵守，不违反交通规则。多数分局的交通队警士们，在整理过程中，发挥了高度的为人民服务的热忱，如内七分局交通队警士，自动停止休息，整日参加整理工作。至于少数违反交通规则者，已作适当教育或惩戒。
