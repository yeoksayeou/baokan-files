The British Labour Government—Serving Imperialism
By Harry Pollitt, translated by Fu Ying

One of the absurd myths about the British Labour government is that the "socialism" we now enjoy in Britain has not only ended capitalism but also imperialism.

Prime Minister Attlee of the Labour government made a grandiloquent speech at the end of 1947, in which this idea was most clearly expressed. He said:

"If there is imperialism in the world today, and imperialism means the political and economic control of one strong country over other nations, then it certainly cannot be found in the British Commonwealth."

There has never been a greater distortion of the truth.

The Attlee Labour government continues to implement the old "divide and rule" policy of British imperialism. In India and Burma, Britain was forced to make some concessions to the national independence movement, but Britain sought the assistance of the local bourgeoisie and landlords to oppose the demands of the people. India under Nehru has become the center of support for British imperialist policy throughout Southeast Asia, especially the anti-communist movement.

Moreover, at present, the British Labour government is conducting a full-scale colonial war in Malaya; after using various imperialist methods of provocation to prevent a solution to the Palestine issue, it is now not voting in favor of Israel's admission to the United Nations as a member state. In Transjordan, it continues its sinful policy. Throughout the Middle East, it is strengthening its imperialist conspiracies. On the African continent, it is now actively engaged in large-scale exploitation of its resources.

The British working class bears a series of costly imperialist adventures, colonial wars, and military obligations. Defense Minister Alexander told Parliament on March 3:

"We intend to spend £760 million on defense in the 1949-1950 financial year. Last year's defense expenditure was £692 million. However, the actual increase is greater than this."

In the 1949-1950 financial year, British overseas military expenditures are estimated to be at least £107 million.

Where does the Labour government, which claims to have "abandoned imperialism," send these troops?

According to official reports, Britain has military bases in Aden, Agber, Bermuda, British Honduras, Cyprus, Cyrenaica, East Africa, the Suez Canal Zone of Egypt, Eritrea, Gibraltar, Greece, Hong Kong, Jamaica, Malaya, Malta, Singapore, Somaliland, Sudan, and Tripolitania. There are also garrisons in Nigeria and the Gold Coast of Africa. The Labour government has special military agreements with the governments of India, Pakistan, and Burma. There are still British officers in the armies of India and Pakistan; according to the British-Burmese agreement, only British troops can enter Burma.

The Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force have many bases in other parts of the Empire.

This vast apparatus of imperialist exploitation and oppression, shamelessly wasting manpower and material resources, is a huge drain on the British economy and a heavy burden on the working class.

However, Labour spokesmen, especially the "Daily Herald," come out to defend the empire even more enthusiastically than Churchill's Conservatives. Labour leaders conceal their imperialist policies with empty words such as "caring for the welfare of backward nations." And according to their recent statements, the Labour government seems to want to make this one of the key points of the next election struggle.

Labour's official propaganda recently boasted that the economic memorandum submitted to the Organization for European Economic Cooperation is the "British Four-Year Plan," which will solve the problems Britain is now encountering.

This memorandum offers no hope of improving the living standards of workers. Its main feature reveals the Labour government's naked imperialist aims, attempting to "solve" Britain's economic crisis by greatly increasing the exploitation of colonial peoples.

The real reason Britain is fighting the Malay people is that tin and rubber are considered the most important dollar-earning commodities.

It is officially acknowledged that this war costs the British people £31,500 a day in war expenses. The bourgeois newspapers are increasingly frustrated with the ultimate outcome of this war. The imperialists' hope of quickly stopping the Malay people's struggle for independence suffered a major blow last month.

The London "Observer" commented on January 23: "Progress is slow... the military has not been as successful as official statements claim."

The Straits Times said on January 21: "The countryside is more unstable, and the military has not made the progress it should have."

The British Labour government has adopted the most despicable means to intimidate the Malay people. British military authorities have admitted to burning villages in retaliation for "non-cooperation." On August 2, Bakili village was destroyed; on August 10, Purai was destroyed; on October 12, Bori Sen was destroyed; on November 2, Kazhao and Batankari were destroyed. Sometimes, entire batches of houses were burned as retaliation. The most prominent examples are: on September 23, eighty houses were burned in the Lihu mining area; on September 24, eighty houses were burned in Badu Yalan; on October 16, one hundred farmers' houses were burned in Songke Sipu. In December, air force sweeps increased, and even naval warships opened fire.

This is the "socialist" policy adopted by Bevin and Attlee in Malaya, where "imperialism has ended."

However, the Labour government's plan to solve the crisis of British imperialism at the expense of the colonial peoples and the British working class has not achieved much.

Clearly, the entire plan outlined in the British memorandum to the Organization for European Economic Cooperation is doomed to failure. First, because the colonial peoples' resistance to the Labour government's plan (which will inevitably increase exploitation and oppression) is growing increasingly fierce. Second, because the huge military expenditure required to crush this resistance places such an impossible burden on the British economy and has such an adverse impact on the living standards of workers, that opposition to the Labour government's entire policy is growing stronger. Third, because this policy inevitably makes Britain more subservient to the stronger American imperialism, making American intrusion into British colonies even greater, and increasing American pressure on Britain to lower the living standards of British workers and delay British nationalization and social welfare facilities;—all of this results in Britain losing even more of its independence.

According to the terms of the Marshall Plan, American capitalists have the right to invest in the British Empire, and Britain must provide all conveniences so that the United States can obtain strategic raw materials to be stockpiled in the United States.

Although the Labour government's policy makes Britain inevitably follow the general plan of American imperialism, the increasing rather than decreasing contradictions between Britain and the United States continue to cause conflict over certain issues. For example, the issue of exploiting Middle Eastern oil resources and using strategic military and air bases. Bevin hopes to use the Arabs to maintain Britain's position in the Middle East, while American imperialists intend to conclude agreements with the reactionaries in the State of Israel to increase their power, thereby weakening Britain's position.

The bankruptcy of Bevin's Palestine policy reflects the relative strength of the two imperialist countries and shows that Britain will inevitably fail if it wants to resist American attacks and maintain Britain's position without completely abandoning imperialist policies.

All of these struggles for markets and investment areas are, of course, subject to the unshakable laws of capitalist economics.

Although investment in Britain itself has decreased, British capital is flowing to South Africa, Rhodesia, and other territories. Barclays Bank alone lent £70 million to South African and Rhodesian businesses in 1947. Imperial Chemical Industries, a large monopoly company, received financial assistance from the Labour government; it proposed to establish a factory in Mikindani and build a new deep-water port in Tanganyika, using £4 million. These are private investments, shameless imperialist investments in this era when Attlee declared that imperialism had been eliminated.

The right-wing Labour leaders boast that they are superior to others in political democracy. Is this so?

The status of Africans in South African territories is notoriously bad. No Africans can be members of parliament to represent their people; Africans, who make up the majority of the population, can only be represented by Europeans.

The new Legislative Council in Kenya has 39 representatives, only two of whom represent four million Africans, and they are recommended by the government.

In South Africa and East Africa, racial discrimination is most distressing—hut taxes, poll taxes, and pass laws are used to force Africans to work in mines and farms; genuine trade unions are prohibited, and strikes against meager wages and miserable living conditions are suppressed with extremely brutal means.

The true national liberation movements in colonial countries are growing stronger; this is the most striking fact of our time. The Burmese government admits that it cannot control the domestic situation. The situation in Indochina is also the same. The people of Indonesia are waging guerrilla warfare against Dutch imperialism. The strength of the Indian popular movement is growing, as can be seen from the Nehru government's official announcement that 6,400 communists have been arrested and imprisoned.

We welcome the growing mass movements in all colonial and semi-colonial countries, whether they are opposing British imperialism or opposing their own exploiters supported by British imperialism.

We demand the unconditional withdrawal of British troops from all colonies and the abolition of strategic bases.

The old privileged position of British imperialism must not be restored. The old privileged position of British imperialism is contrary to the interests of the British people and the interests of the people of the British Empire (referring to its territories and colonies). For the British people and the colonial people, their future lies equally in the permanent abolition of imperialist rule, in intimate cooperation (cooperation based on the right of self-determination of all nations and the measures necessary to realize self-determination).

The British working class's struggle to seize power requires a ruthless struggle against the Conservative Party and the right-wing Labour leaders. We should repeatedly remind the British working class, who are struggling to seize power, that those who participate in exploiting and oppressing others can never be free themselves.

The Labour government's imperialism means lowering the living standards of British workers and their families, and means losing their national independence.

All of these great struggles require the full support and solidarity of the British working class, because we are entering a situation in which we ourselves also need the support and solidarity of workers elsewhere. Our own dependence on international assistance is indeed the same as the degree to which workers in other capitalist countries depend on international assistance.

It is precisely for this reason that we must fight against Deakin and leaders of his ilk who have violated the wishes of the British working masses and withdrawn the British trade union from the World Federation of Trade Unions. The crimes of the right-wing Labour leaders, which reveal the true face of the right-wing social democrats, who are in fact loyal servants of imperialism, should be made known to the working people of the whole world.

### 英国工党政府—为帝国主义服务

　　英国工党政府—为帝国主义服务
    英共总书记波立特著  福英译
    关于英国工党政府的荒唐神话之一，就是说，我们在英国现在所享有的社会主义，不仅终止了资本主义，而且也终止了帝国主义。
    工党政府首相艾特里在一九四七年末作了一次大吹牛屁的演讲，在这次演讲中，把这种想法讲得最明显。他说：
    “如果今天世界上有帝国主义，而帝国主义底意思是指一个强国对其他民族之政治的和经济的控制，那末，在不列颠联邦是一定找不到的。”
    对于真相之歪曲，未有甚于此者。
    艾特里工党政府继续施行英帝国主义底“分而治之”底旧政策。在印度与缅甸，英国被迫而不得不对民族独立运动作某些让步，但英国争取当地的资产阶级与地主底援助，来反对人民底要求。尼赫鲁统治下的印度，变成为支持英帝国主义在整个东南亚的政策之中心，尤其是反共运动之中心。
    而且，在目前，英国工党政府正在马来亚进行全面的殖民地战争；对于巴勒斯坦，在用各种帝国主义的挑拨方法来阻止其获得问题解决之后，现在则不投票赞成伊色列加入联合国组织为会员国。在外约旦则继续其罪恶的政策。在中东各地，则加强其帝国主义的阴谋。在非洲大陆，现在积极地从事大量剥削其资源。
    英国劳动阶级负担着一连串的费用浩大的帝国主义的冒险、殖民地战争、和军事义务。国防大臣亚历山大在三月三日告诉国会说：
    “我们打算在一九四九—一九五○年度，用七亿六千万镑为国防费。去年的国防费则为六亿九千二百万镑。可是，实际的增加，比此为大。”
    在一九四九—一九五○年会计年度英国海外军队费用占计最少为一亿零七百万镑。
    自称已“废弃了帝国主义”的工党政府派遣这些军队驻在什么地方呢？
    根据官方报告，英国在亚丁、亚格伯、百募大、英属洪都拉、赛普拉斯、西利内伊卡、东非、埃及苏彝士运河地带、厄立特利亚、直布罗陀、希腊、香港、牙买加、马来亚、玛尔他、新加坡、索马利兰、苏丹、特利波利塔尼阿，都有军事基地。在奈基利阿和非洲黄金海岸也有驻军。工党政府与印度、巴基斯坦、和缅甸政府之间，有特别军事协定。在印度及巴基斯坦的军队中，尚有英国军官；照英缅协定，只有英国军队得进入缅甸。
    皇家海军与皇家空军在帝国其他部分有许多的基地。
    这个帝国主义的剥削和压迫底浩大的机构，无耻地浪费着人力物力，对英国经济是一巨大的耗费，对劳动阶级是一极重的负担。
    然而工党发言人，尤其是“每日先锋报”，出来拥护帝国，比邱吉尔底保守党人还更热情。工党领袖们以“关怀落后民族底福利”这类的空话来掩蔽他们底帝国主义的政策。而且就最近的他们的声明看来，工党政府好象是要以此作下次大选斗争的要点之一。
    工党的官方宣传，最近吹牛屁说，向欧洲经济合作组织所提出的经济备忘录，就是“英国四年计划”，它会解决英国现在所遭遇的问题。
    这备忘录并没有使工人生活标准有改善之丝毫希望。其主要特点显露出工党政府底赤裸裸的帝国主义的目的，企图以大量增加对殖民地人民的剥削来“解决”英国底经济危机。
    英国对马来人民作战，其真正理由是：锡和橡皮被视为最主要的赚取美元的商品。
    官方承认此一战争使英国人民每天要付出战费三万一千五百镑。资产阶级的报纸，对于此一战争底最后结果如何，是日益沮丧。帝国主义者希望迅速停止马来人民底独立斗争，这个希望在上月受了很大的打击。
    伦敦“观察报”一月廿三日评论说：“进展得缓………军事并没有象官方声明所说的那末成功。”
    海峡殖民地“时报”一月廿一日说：“乡村是更不稳定，军事并没有得到其所应有的那种进展。”
    英国工党政府采取了最卑怯的手段来威吓马来人民。英国军事当局承认了因为报复村镇之“不合作”，而将其烧毁。在八月二日，巴基利村被毁；八月十日，普来被毁；十月十二日，波李森被毁；十一月二日，卡曹与巴坦卡里被毁。有时，以烧毁整批的房屋，作为报复。最显著的例子就是：九月二十三日在里虎矿区烧了八十座房屋；九月二十四日在巴杜亚兰烧了八十座房屋；十月十六日在宋格西普烧了一百座农民房子。在十二月，空军扫射增加，甚至海军军舰开炮轰击。
    这就是贝文和艾特里在“帝国主义已终止”的马来亚所采行的“社会主义的”政策。
    可是，工党政府底计划，以牺牲殖民地人民和英国劳动阶级来解决英帝国主义的危机，并没有什么大的成就。
    很明显地，英国向欧洲经济合作组织提出的备忘录中所概括叙述的整个计划，是注定失败的。第一是由于殖民地人民对工党政府底计划（这计划必然使剥削和压迫更增加）之抵抗日益猛烈。第二是由于要粉碎这种抵抗而化的巨大的军费给予英国经济加上了如此不可能的负担，而且对工人底生活程度有如此不利的影响，使得对工党政府底整个政策之反对派日益强大。第三是由于这一政策必然使英国更加屈服于更强大的美帝国主义，使美国之侵入英国殖民地更甚，使美国压迫英国降低英国工人生活程度和延缓英国国有化与社会福利设施之压力更大；——这一切底结果是英国更丧失其独立性。
    按照马歇尔计划底条件，美国大资本家有权在英帝国中投资，英国必须给予一切便利，使美国能获得战略原料，运至美国囤积着。
    虽然工党政府底政策，使英国必然跟从美帝国主义底一般的计划，英美两国间之日益增加的而不是日益减少的矛盾，却引起对某些问题继续冲突。例如，关于剥削中东石油资源以及使用战略的军事和空军基地之问题。贝文希望利用亚拉伯人来维持英国在中东的地位，美帝国主义者则打算与伊色列国中的反动分子成立协定以增加其势力，因而削弱了英国底地位。
    贝文底巴勒斯坦政策底破产，是反映出两个帝国主义国家底相对力量，并表明了英国如果不完全放弃帝国主义的政策，想要挡住美国的进攻而保持英国底地位，是必然失败的。
    这一切为争夺市场及投资区域之斗争，当然是服从于资本主义经济底不能动摇的法则。
    在英国本国中的投资虽然减少，但英国资本却走向南非洲、罗谛西亚、以及其他领地。单是巴克来斯银行，在一九四七年，贷给南非洲和罗谛西亚的企业的款项就已达七千万镑。帝国化学工业公司是一个很大的独占公司，得到工党政府底财政援助；它建议在米金大尼设立一个工厂，并在坦干伊喀建一新的深水港，用了四百万镑。这些是私人的投资，是在艾特里宣称帝国主义已消灭的这个时代的不知耻的帝国主义的投资。
    工党右派领袖们吹牛屁说他们在政治的民主上是比别人高明。是不是如此呢？
    在南非领土内的非洲人底地位，是坏得尽人皆知。在国会中没有非洲人能当议员来代表其人民；非洲人占人口底大多数，只能由欧洲人当他们底代表。
    肯雅底新的立法会有代表三十九人，其中只有二人是代表着四百万非洲人，而且他们是由政府推荐的。
    在南非和东非，种族歧视来得最令人难受——屋税、人头税、通行证法，是被用来强迫非洲人在矿山和农场工作；禁止真正的职工会，以极野蛮的手段来镇压因反对小得可怜的工资和凄惨的生活情况的罢工。
    殖民地国家中的真正为民族解放的运动，其力量日益增长；这是我们的时代底最醒目的事实。缅甸政府承认不能控制国内的形势。印度支那底情形也如是。印度尼西亚的人民采取游击战争来反对荷兰帝国主义。印度民众运动底力量增长，从尼赫鲁政府正式宣布有六千四百名共产党人被捕入狱，就可看出来了。
    我们欢迎在一切殖民地半殖民地中的日益增长的群众运动，不论他们是反对英帝国主义，或是反对英帝国主义所支持的他们本国的剥削者。
    我们要求英国在一切殖民地的军队一律撤出，和取消战略基地。
    英帝国主义底旧有的特权地位，不许恢复。英帝国主义底旧有的特权地位，与英国人民底利益以及英帝国（指其属地及殖民地）人民底利益，是相违背的。对于英国人民与殖民地人民，其前途同样是在于永远废止帝国主义的统治，在于亲爱的合作（以一切民族底自决权并实现自决权所需的措施为基础的合作）。
    英国劳动阶级为夺取政权而奋斗，需要对保守党和工党右派领袖作无情的斗争。我们应反复提醒在为夺取政权而奋斗的英国劳动阶级说：参与剥削和压迫别人的，他们自己就决不能自由。
    工党政府底帝国主义，对于英国工人是意味着降低他们及其家庭底生活程度，是意味着丧失其民族独立。
    这一切的伟大的斗争，需要英国劳动阶级底全力支援和表示团结，因为我们正在进入这样的一种情形，即我们自己也需要他地的工人之支援和表示团结一致。我们自己之依赖国际援助，确是和其他资本主义国家的工人之依赖国际援助程度一样。
    正因为这个缘故，对于狄金及其同类的领袖之违背英国工人群众底愿望而把英国工会退出世界工联，是必须向他们作斗争。应使全世界的劳动人民都知道右派工党领袖们底罪过，这些罪过显出右派社会民主党人底真面目，原来是帝国主义底忠仆。
