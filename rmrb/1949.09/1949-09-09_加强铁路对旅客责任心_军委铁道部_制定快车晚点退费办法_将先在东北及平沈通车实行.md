　　Strengthen Railways' Sense of Responsibility to Passengers
  　Military Commission and Ministry of Railways
  　Formulate Measures for Refund of Express Train Delay Fees
    To be Implemented First on Northeast and Beijing-Shenyang Trains
    [Report from this newspaper] In order to reduce train delays caused by non-natural disasters or incidents and to strengthen the People's Railways' sense of responsibility to passengers, the Military Commission and Ministry of Railways have formulated measures for refunding express train fees for delayed express trains. Passengers who purchase express train tickets and arrive at their destination more than three hours late due to railway responsibility (including delays in operation time due to loading and unloading locomotives, lines, dispatching, etc.) may request a refund of the express train fee. Designated express train stops, when an express train is indeed more than three hours late due to railway responsibility, each station should automatically refund the express train fee to arriving passengers. When processing the refund of the express train fee, the express train ticket must be taken back and refunded after matching with the passenger ticket. It is also stipulated that no handling fee will be charged. This method will be implemented first in the Northeast Railway Bureau and the Beijing-Shenyang train line starting from September 10th, and other lines will be subject to regulations when conditions are met.

    【本报讯】军委铁道部为减少非天灾、事变等原因的列车误点，加强人民铁道对旅客的责任心，特制定快车晚点退还快车费办法。凡购买快车票的旅客，因铁路责任（包括装卸机车、线路、调度等原因耽误运行时间）到站晚三小时以上者，得请求退还快车费。指定快车停车站，遇快车确系因铁路责任晚到三小时以上时，各车站即应自动将快车费退还到达旅客，办理退还快车费时，须将快车票收回，与客票对照相符后退还快车费。并规定不收手续费，该办法自九月十日起先在东北铁路总局管内及平沈通车实行，其他各线俟条件具备时再行规定办理。
