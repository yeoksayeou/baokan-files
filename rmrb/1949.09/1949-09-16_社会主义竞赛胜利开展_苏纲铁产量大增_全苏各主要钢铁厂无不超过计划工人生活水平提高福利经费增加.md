　　Socialist Competition Wins Great Success
  　Soviet Steel Production Increases Greatly
    All Major Soviet Steel Plants Exceed Plans, Workers' Living Standards Improve, Welfare Funds Increase

    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 15th] TASS reports a comprehensive overview of significant expansions in the production of steel, iron, and rolled metal across all major Soviet steel plants. Factories from the Donbas to the Urals and Siberia have exceeded their production plans for the first eight months of this year. The nation's largest steel industry centers, Magnitogorsk and Kuznetsk, have surpassed their August plans by smelting tens of thousands of tons of steel. Magnitogorsk plants have even reached the average daily production level of 1950, saving 151 million rubles beyond the plan this year. In the first seven months of this year, the Kuznetsk factory exceeded its capital accumulation plan, adding an extra 60 million rubles to state property. Blast furnace workers and steelworkers at the plant have created new production records, with steelworkers recently completing 124 fast melts in recent months. Ural steelworkers are committed to completing their annual production plan before November 7th. Steel factories in Dnepropetrovsk, Moscow, and Sverdlovsk have also completed their August plans and are expanding production beyond the plan.
    The development of steel production is inseparable from socialist competition among workers. Ninety-six winning steel factories have been awarded the Red Banner of Victory and bonuses for the second quarter competition. The scale of the competition initiated by Vasily Amossov, a steelworker at the Zlatoust Stalin Steel Plant, is particularly large. More than 19,000 workers from this location and the Magnitogorsk and Chelyabinsk plants have participated in the competition.
    The development of production and the increase in labor productivity have also increased workers' income and living standards. Collective contracts stipulate the construction of more than 760,000 square meters of housing for steelworkers. Cultural palaces, clubs, libraries, and cinemas are also being added in large numbers. This year, 72 million rubles have been allocated for cultural services for steelworkers.

　　社会主义竞赛胜利开展
  　苏纲铁产量大增
    全苏各主要钢铁厂无不超过计划工人生活水平提高福利经费增加
    【新华社北平十五日电】综合塔斯社消息，全苏各主要钢铁厂在钢、铁和辗金属的生产上已有显著的扩展。从顿巴斯、乌拉尔一直到西伯利亚各地的工厂已超过今年头八个月生产计划。全国最大的钢铁业中心——马格尼托哥尔斯克和库兹涅茨克，已超出八月份计划熔炼了成千成万吨的钢铁。马格尼托哥尔斯克各厂且已达到一九五零年的每日平均生产水平，今年并超计划地节省了一亿五千一百万卢布。库兹涅茨克工厂在今年头七个月中，超过资本积累计划，额外地增加了六千万卢布的国家财产。该厂鼓风炉工人和炼钢工人制造了新的生产纪录，炼钢工人最近数月来作了一百二十四次快速熔炼。乌拉尔钢铁工人保证在十一月七日以前完成全年生产计划。德涅伯罗彼德罗夫斯克、莫斯科及斯维德洛夫斯克各钢铁工厂，也已完成八月份计划，并正超计划地扩大生产中。
    钢铁生产的发展是与工人社会主义竞赛分不开的。九十六个钢铁工厂的优胜者已获得了第二季竞赛的优胜红旗和奖金。由兹拉托斯特的斯大林钢铁厂炼钢工人瓦西利·阿莫索夫所倡导的竞赛规模尤大。该地与马格尼托哥尔斯克及车里雅宾斯克各厂，已有一万九千多名工人参加竞赛。
    生产的发展、劳动生产率的提高，使工人的所得和生活水平也提高了。集体合同规定为钢铁工人建筑七十六万余平方公尺居住面积的房屋。文化宫、俱乐部、图书馆、电影场等也在大量增设中。今年为钢铁工人文化服务的经费已指拨了七千二百万卢布。
