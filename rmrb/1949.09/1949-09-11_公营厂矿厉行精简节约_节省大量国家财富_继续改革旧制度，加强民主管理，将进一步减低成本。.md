[This Municipality News] Comprehensive Report: The streamlining and economy work of public-owned mines and factories in Beiping has achieved preliminary results.

I. Streamlining organizations and improving production efficiency. The Water Company originally had only 307 workers, but as many as 274 staff members. After the takeover, the organization was adjusted, 11 special agents were cleared out, and more than 80 staff members were streamlined (mostly staff members), saving more than 50,000 catties of millet per month. The number of staff in the Business Section was reduced from 110 to 75. Although 300 new users were added, not only was the work not hindered, but the efficiency was improved. Before liberation, the Trolleybus Company needed more than 90 workdays to repair an electric roller, but now it only takes 40 workdays to do the same job. The Beiping Garment Factory used to make an average of four sets of cotton military uniforms per person per day, but now it has increased to seven sets. Some factories have begun to organize the surplus manpower from various production units and use them in new production areas.

II. Abolishing unreasonable systems and initially establishing cost accounting. In terms of various systems, there were either none before, or they were extremely unreasonable. Costs could not be calculated, and responsibility could not be determined. The Mentougou Coal Mine saved 300,000 catties of millet per month just by reforming seven unreasonable systems such as bonuses and housing subsidies. After the Public Bus Company implemented the contracted responsibility system in August, in addition to reducing failures, the daily ticket income more than doubled. After the Qinghe Woolen Mill calculated the cost of each production unit separately, not only did the output increase, but each unit actively requested to reduce indirect producers and unnecessary personnel. The Beiping Municipal People's Government Enterprise Bureau has been urging factories and mines to establish a cost accounting system since June, which is now being carried out step by step. Most factories have a daily report system and a budget system.

III. Saving coal and electricity and improving technology. After the liberation of Beiping, workers generally showed a high degree of enthusiasm and creativity in saving coal and electricity and improving technology in the production process. The boiler room workers of the Qinghe Woolen Mill not only repaired the corroded steel boiler lace and fixed the boiler that had been abandoned for two years, but also encrypted the grate bars to save coal, so that the coal consumption was two-thirds less than during the Kuomintang reactionary rule (comparing June this year with June last year, the amount of steam used was still more than last year). The workers of the Second Soy Sauce Factory took extra care to protect the water pump and save water and electricity. As a result, the output in July increased by a quarter, and the electricity consumption decreased by 7%. The newly built Iron Factory added oil boxes, which saved one-fifth of the machine oil every month. In addition, it is a common phenomenon for workers to find useful materials from waste materials and reduce expenses. In terms of technological improvement, the chuck claw groove milling cutter designed by the workers of the 70th Arsenal increased the output by nine times, and the modified casing cutter increased the output by ten times. Workers at the First Branch of the Beiping Machine Factory studied how to quench blades, saving one-third of the consumption. The Enterprise Bureau called for the use of castor oil instead of machine oil on rough machines. It is estimated that the 16 units under the bureau alone can save several million yuan per month.

IV. Eradicating bureaucratic work style. Before liberation, factories and enterprises were bureaucratized, irresponsible in case of trouble, and arbitrarily squandered the people's blood and sweat. After preliminary rectification after liberation, there were significant achievements. The Water Company started repairing leaky pipes in May, and by the end of August, it leaked more than 1,000 metric tons of water less per day, achieving an average reduction of more than 30,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity per month (comparing May, June, and July this year with May, June, and July last year). In February, the cost of each metric ton of water was equivalent to two catties of millet, but now it is only equivalent to one and a half catties. In the past, the Mentougou Coal Mine had to go through eleven procedures to buy a thing. A kiln wood cost 16 catties of millet to buy outside, but after these procedures, it became 20 catties. This problem is now being gradually corrected. The Enterprise Bureau only replaced small light bulbs and turned off unnecessary lights every night, and the electricity consumption in August was more than half less than in June.

V. Raise vigilance, prevent fire and prevent spies. Beiping has had a series of tragic lessons: In April, special agents burned 59 trolleybuses and the laboratory of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant caught fire. From the end of June to the beginning of July, Mentougou suffered three consecutive explosions and fires, resulting in heavy losses. In the past two months, due to the leadership's emphasis on fire prevention and anti-espionage, factories and mines have improved the workers' security team and fire brigade, and regularly inspected fire-fighting equipment, which has basically prevented similar incidents from happening. Regarding this point, Beiping's experience is: If the leadership cannot rely on the workers, raise vigilance, and eliminate complacency, all achievements in production and economy will be destroyed by special agents, causing huge losses to state property.

In the past six months, although there have been these achievements, it is still not enough. Even worse is the work in reforming the old system and establishing a new system. The Trolleybus Company has not yet implemented the contracted responsibility system (after implementation, it is estimated that more than 10 million yuan can be saved every month), and the five sections, eighteen divisions, and thirty-two units have not been adjusted. Many factories and mines do not yet have a personal production standard record system, a reasonable reward and punishment system, etc. The Yanjing Paper Mill does not even have statistics on "damaged paper" (bad paper in the production process). In some factories and mines, the bureaucratic work style has not been completely eliminated. In many factories and mines, the person in charge does not know what is stored in the warehouse, and lets it rot. Secondly, there is the issue of combining the leadership with the masses. Until now, except for a very small number of factories, the factory management committee has not been established. And even those that have been established have not been able to play a full role. The democratization of factory management has not been achieved in most cases, which directly affects the development of production and the reduction of costs. Some administrative cadres still believe that reporting to superiors and following the mass line is a burden; cadres with this kind of thinking cannot wholeheartedly rely on the workers. The experience of the past six months proves that in the newly liberated areas, the takeover cadres must unite and transform the retained personnel. The Mentougou Coal Mine implemented several unreasonable systems, wasting 300,000 catties of millet per month. The old staff had seen it long ago, but they "did not dare to say it, and had nowhere to say it," which led to the monthly increase in the cost of coal production. It was not corrected until July. In the past few months, trade union cadres have rarely paid attention to production and economy. Recently, the preparatory committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and the industrial trade union have pointed out this bias, emphasizing that production and economy is a particularly important task in the current trade union work.

　　公营厂矿厉行精简节约
　  节省大量国家财富
    继续改革旧制度，加强民主管理，将进一步减低成本。
    【本市讯】综合报导：北平各公营矿厂的精简节约工作，已获初步成绩。
    一、精简机构，提高了生产效率。自来水公司，原仅有工人三百零七人，职员却多至二百七十四人。接管后，调整机构，清除了十一个特务，精简了八十几个职工（大部分是职员），每月就节省了五万多斤小米。业务科职工从一百一十人减为七十五人，虽增加了三百户用户，不但没有妨害工作，反而效率提高了。电车公司在解放前修一个电滚子要九十多工，现在作同样的活，只用四十个工。北平被服厂以前每人每天平均做四套棉军装，现在提高到七套。有的工厂，已开始把各生产单位多余的人力组织起来，用到新的生产方面去。
    二、废除不合理制度，初步建立了成本会计。在各种制度方面，以前或者根本没有，或者极不合理。成本无法计算，责任无法判明。门头沟煤矿，只改革了奖金提成，房贴等七种不合理的制度，每月就省下了三十万斤小米。公共汽车公司八月实行包乘制后，除减少故障外，每天客票收入就多了一倍半。清河制呢厂各生产单位分别计算成本后，不仅产量增多了，而且各单位都积极要求减少间接生产者和不必要的人员。北平市人民政府企业局从六月起督促各厂矿树立成本会计制度，现正逐步进行，一般的工厂都有了日报制和预算制。
    三、节省煤电改进技术。北平解放后，工人在生产过程中节省煤电与改进技术方面，普遍表现了高度的积极性与创造性。清河制呢厂锅炉房工人，不只修补了＠钢的锅炉花边，治好了弃置两年的锅炉，而且加密炉条，节省烧煤，使煤的消耗量比国民党反动统治时期少了三分之二（今年六月与去年六月比较，所用蒸汽量还比去年多）。第二酱油厂工人加意爱护水泵，节省水电，结果，七月份产量提高了四分之一，电力少用了百分之七。新建铁工厂添了油盒，每月就节省了五分之一的机器油。此外，工人从废料中找用材料，减少开支，更是普遍现象。在改进技术方面，七十兵工厂工人设计的卡盘爪车槽铣刀提高了产量九倍，改造的套管刀提高了产量十倍。北平机器厂第一分厂工人研究洗刀＠火，节省三分之一的消耗量。企业局号召在粗机器上用蓖麻油代替机器油，只局属十六个单位，每月估计即可省数百万元。
    四、根除衙门作风。解放前，工厂企业衙门化，遇事不负责任，任意＠蹋人民血汗。解放后，初步整顿之下，就有了显著成绩。自来水公司从五月开始检修漏管，到八月底，每天就少漏水一千多公吨，做到每月平均少用电三万多度（今年五六七月与去年五六七月比较）。二月里每公吨水的成本合两斤小米，现在只合一斤半了。门头沟煤矿过去买一件东西要经十一层手续，一根窑木，在外面买是十六斤小米，经过这些手续，就变成二十斤了。这个毛病现正逐步纠正。企业局只是换用小灯泡，每天晚上把不必需的灯熄掉，八月份用电就比六月份少了一半多。
    五、提高警惕，防火防特。北平曾有过一连串惨痛的教训：四月里，特务烧了五十九辆电车和石景山钢铁厂化验室失火。六月底到七月初，门头沟连续发生爆炸和失火三次，损失均甚大。最近两个月来，由于领导的强调防火防特，各厂矿都健全了工人保卫队、消防队，经常检查消防器具，才基本上防止了类似事件的发生。关于这点，北平的经验是：如果领导上不能依靠工人，提高警惕，消灭麻痹现象，则一切生产节约的成绩，都将为特务破坏而使国家财产受到巨大损失。
    半年来，虽然有了这些成绩，但是做得还不够。在改革旧制度，建立新制度方面做得更差。电车公司还没有实行包乘制（实行后，据估计每月可省千余万元），五处十八科三十二股还没有调整。许多厂矿还没有个人生产标准表记制度，合理的奖惩制度等。燕京造纸厂连“损纸”（生产过程中的坏纸）的统计都没有。有些厂矿，衙门作风还没有彻底消除，不少的厂矿仓库里存的东西是什么，负责人都不知道，任它糟烂下去。其次是领导上与群众结合的问题，到现在，除极少数工厂外，工厂管理委员会还没有成立。而已经成立的，也还不能发挥充分的作用。工厂管理民主化、大部分没有作到，直接影响到发展生产与减低成本。有的行政干部还认为向上请示报告和走群众路线是个负担；存在着这种思想的干部，是不可能全心全意依靠工人的。半年来的经验证明，在新解放区，接管干部对留用人员，必须加以团结和改造。门头沟煤矿实行几种不合理的制度，每月浪费三十万斤小米，旧职员早就看出来了，但是他们却“不敢说，也无处说。”以致产煤成本逐月增加。直到七月才改正过来。工会干部在过去几个月中，很少注意到生产节约，最近市总工会筹委会产业工会已指出此种偏向，强调生产节约是当前工会工作中特别重要的任务。
