　　Commentary on the Beijing Construction Industry Labor-Capital Collective Contract
    The labor and capital sides of the Beijing construction industry officially signed a collective contract on the 23rd of this month. This collective contract resolves some of the unclear issues between labor and capital and within the workers themselves in the Beijing construction industry in the past.

    First is the issue of wages. In the past, wages were not based on the season, working hours, or skill level, but stipulated a uniform wage; and it was customary for construction workers to gather and jointly agree on wages every year on "March 3rd" (of the lunar calendar), and it was not allowed to be violated, otherwise, they would be "severely punished." This contract changes the unreasonable old practice and re-stipulates that "the wage for temporary skilled workers is generally based on 12 catties of millet per workday, and the wage for temporary unskilled workers is generally based on 8 catties of millet," but it can be "increased or decreased temporarily by mutual agreement between the two parties according to the situation"; however, the minimum wage for skilled workers shall not be less than 11 catties, and the wage for unskilled workers shall not be less than 7 catties. In this way, on the one hand, the minimum wage for various construction workers is guaranteed, and on the other hand, some increases or decreases are allowed under the voluntary conditions of labor and capital according to different seasons. This is an improvement compared to the previous wage system.

    Second is the treatment of apprentices. In the past, employers and masters often beat and abused apprentices, and there was a so-called "no responsibility for beating to death." As for apprentices wanting to terminate the contract midway, it was not allowed at all, while the employer was not subject to any restrictions. This contract clearly stipulates that the employer and master should "care for apprentices, honestly guide their skills, and strictly prohibit beating and abuse," and apprentices should have the same right to terminate the contract as ordinary workers, completely based on the principle of voluntariness. This breaks the feudalistic master-apprentice relationship of the past and protects the personal freedom of apprentices.

    Third is the issue of welfare, especially the issue of compensation for injuries and deaths. This is one of the most urgent issues to be resolved among construction workers. Because construction workers are most likely to encounter danger during work, and they may become disabled or even die if they are not careful, there was no fixed and proper arrangement in the past. This time, the contract stipulates that "the employer shall strive for safety in the equipment for employees during work and be responsible for strict inspection" to reduce the possibility of danger, and stipulates specific measures for handling worker illnesses, injuries, and deaths, which increases the employer's attention to worker safety. This is a matter of the utmost concern to construction workers.

    Fourth is the issue of profit sharing. At the beginning of the contract negotiation, the employer proposed to distribute profits at the end of the year according to a ratio of three, three, three, and one, but this clause was later canceled through negotiation. Because the so-called "30% profit bonus" is actually part of the total wages of the workers, and the so-called profit sharing is actually the employer withholding this part of the wages and paying it to the workers at the end of the year. This is unreasonable. In addition, the vast majority of construction workers are temporary workers, and the number of long-term workers is very small, so the so-called "30% profit bonus" can actually only be obtained by a small number of long-term workers, and the vast majority of temporary workers cannot get it. Dividing the wages of the majority of workers among a small number of workers can easily split the unity of the workers and create divisions within the workers.

    Fifth, this contract clearly stipulates the minimum wage standard and the specific handling measures for injury and death compensation. On the one hand, it provides a basic guarantee for the lives of workers, thus increasing their enthusiasm for production; on the other hand, it enables employers to have something to follow when dealing with the above-mentioned issues that are most likely to cause disputes between labor and capital, and enables employers to have a certain standard when contracting projects and calculating the number of workers and the profits that may be obtained, thus eliminating many unnecessary concerns and troubles.

    Sixth, the contract clearly stipulates that the employer has the right to hire employees and, under certain conditions, to dismiss employees. Such as dismissal and layoff of workers due to business changes, business closures, and reduction of operations, and the right of both parties to freely terminate the contract upon expiration of the contract period. This resolves the dispute between labor and capital regarding the issue of contract termination that has existed for several months.

    Due to the resolution of the above-mentioned problems, the lives of workers and the operating conditions of employers have been favorably guaranteed, which is of great benefit to the restoration and development of production. However, this contract still has shortcomings, the main one being its generality. It has not completely broken free from the constraints of the old wage system and still follows the old unreasonable two-tier wage system. In the past, under the rule of the reactionary government, this wage system was beneficial because it could prevent and eliminate competition within workers, prevent employers from defeating workers one by one, and was simple and easy to implement. But strictly speaking, it is unscientific and unreasonable. Because construction workers include various types of workers such as carpenters, masons, paperhangers, lantern makers, painters, etc., and there are various differences in skills and proficiency among various workers; in different seasons, the supply and demand relationship of labor is different, the working hours are different, but the wages are stipulated as two levels, such as eight catties and twelve catties. This not only fails to fully encourage workers to learn technology and improve technology, but also fails to fully encourage workers' enthusiasm for work. Therefore, we believe that this is very unreasonable. However, the habits of labor and capital have been followed for a long time and are not easy to break at once, so the contract still adopts a two-tier wage system.

    Secondly, in the process of contract negotiation, because it was attempted to solve all the problems between labor and capital in one contract at the beginning, there were too many clauses, and it was not easy to reach a complete agreement quickly; at the same time, very few problems were solved for temporary workers, who account for about 90% of the total number of workers, so it took a long time to deliberate repeatedly, but the two simple agreements on temporary wages played a decisive and positive role. Experience proves that a labor-capital collective contract in an industry should also have a focus and flexibility. It should not be too cumbersome, nor should it be a demand for perfection.

    The current contract is temporary in nature, and can be reasonably modified based on execution experience after half a year. Therefore, there is no need and it is impossible to permanently solve all problems in one contract. These experiences are worth remembering.

### 评北京市建筑业劳资集体合同

　　评北京市建筑业劳资集体合同
    北京市建筑业劳资双方已于本月二十三日正式签订了集体合同。这个集体合同解决了北京市建筑业劳资间及工人内部过去的一些纠缠不清的问题。
    第一是工资问题。过去的工资是不按季节、不按工作时间、不分技术高低，而规定一律的工资；并且在习惯上每年“三月三”由建筑工人聚会共同议定工资后，即不许违背，否则即会受到“严重处分”。此次合同则改变了过去不合理的旧例，重新规定“临时大工每工一般以小米十二斤为标准，临时小工工资一般以小米八斤为标准”，但可“由双方临时依情况协议增减之”；惟大工最低工资不得低于十一斤，小工不得低于七斤。这样一方面保证了各种建筑工人的最低工资，一方面又允许根据不同的季节，在劳资双方自愿条件下可以有若干增减。这比之过去的工资制是改良了。
    第二是学徒的待遇。过去资方与师傅对徒弟打骂虐待行为是很多的，并且有所谓“打死勿论”，至于学徒要中途解约是根本不许可的，而东家则不受任何限制。此次合同中则明确规定了资方和师傅应“爱护工徒，诚实指导技术，严禁打骂虐待”，而徒弟应与一般工人有同样的解约权利，完全根据自愿的原则。这样就打破了过去的封建性的师徒关系，保障了学徒的人身自由。
    第三是福利问题，特别是伤亡抚恤问题。这是建筑工人中一个最需要解决的问题。因为建筑工人在工作时最易发生危险，偶一不慎即会摔成残废，甚至丧命，过去对此是没有固定的妥善安置办法的。这一次在合同中则规定了“资方对职工工作时之设备，应力求安全，并负责严密检查”，以减少发生危险之可能，并规定了对工人疾病伤亡处理的具体办法，这样就提高了资方对工人安全的注意，这是建筑业工人最关心的一个问题。
    第四是分红问题。在订约之初，资方曾提出将利润按照三、三、三、一的比例于年底分红，后来在谈判中经过协议取消了这一条。因为所谓“三成红利”实际上是全体工人工资的一部分，所谓分红实际上是资方将这部分工资扣留在年终再付给工人。这本是不合理的。加以建筑业工人绝大多数是临时工，长期工为数很少，所谓“三成分红”实际上只有一小部分长期工能够得到，绝大多数的临时工是得不到的。把多数工人工资分给少数工人，很容易分裂工人的团结，造成工人内部分歧。
    第五、这次合同中明确规定了最低的工资标准，规定了伤亡抚恤的具体处理办法，这样一方面使工人生活得到了基本保障，因而也会提高其生产的积极性；另一方面又使资方在处理劳资双方最易引起纠纷的上述问题时有所遵循，使资方在承揽工程时计算工数，计算可能获得的利润时有一定的标准，解除了很多不必要的顾虑和苦恼。
    第六、在合同中又明白规定了资方有雇用职工和在一定条件下解雇职工之权。如由于转业、歇业及缩小营业时辞退和遣散工人及契约期满时双方自由解约的权利等。这样就解决了几个月以来存在着的劳资双方关于解约问题上的纠纷。
    由于上述问题的解决，工人的生活和资方的营业条件都获得了有利的保障，这对于生产之恢复与发展是有很大好处的。但这个合同还是有缺点的，其主要缺点是一般化。它还没有完全超脱旧的工资制度的束缚，还沿袭了旧的不合理的两级工资制。过去在反动政府统治时代，这种工资制因为可以防止和消除工人内部的竞争，可以防止资方对工人各个击破，同时又简单易行，是有好处的。但严格说来，它是不科学、不合理的。因为建筑业工人中包含着各种不同的工人如木匠、泥瓦匠、裱糊匠、扎彩匠、油漆匠等，而各种工人中又有各种不同的技术和熟练程度的差别；在不同的季节，劳动力的供求关系不同，工作时间不同，而工资却规定为两级，如八斤、十二斤。这样不但不能充分鼓励工人学习技术改进技术的热情，而且也不能充分鼓励工人的劳动积极性。所以我们认为这是很不合理的。但劳资双方的习惯，沿袭已久，一时不易打破，故合同中仍采用了两级工资制。
    其次，在合同商订过程中，因为开始阶段曾企图在一个合同中解决劳资间所有的问题，因而条款太多，不易很快完全商得一致；同时，对于占工人总数百分之九十左右的临时工的问题，又解决的甚少，因此反复斟酌费时很久，倒是关于临时工资的两条简单的协定，却起了决定的积极作用。经验证明：一个行业的劳资集体合同也应有重点，和伸缩性，不应太繁琐，亦不应作求全的责备。
    现在的合同本是临时性质的，半年后即可根据执行经验作合理之修改。因此用不着、也不可能在一次合同中把一切问题都作永久性的解决，这些经验都是值得记取的。
