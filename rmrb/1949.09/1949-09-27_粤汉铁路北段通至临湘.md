　　Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 26th: The Puqi Bridge and Yanglousi Bridge on the northern section of the Yuehan Railway were both repaired on the 23rd. The northern section of the Yuehan Railway, from Wuchang to Linxiang County, Hunan Province, a distance of 180 kilometers, is now officially open to traffic. The middle section of the line is open to traffic from Changsha north to Miluo and from Changsha south to Lukou. The bridges between Linxiang and Miluo have also been repaired and will be connected in the near future. The Puqi Bridge was severely damaged when the Bai bandit Chongxi's bandit troops collapsed and retreated. The Engineering Bureau of the Railway Ministry of the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission sent personnel to lead the emergency repair work, and finally overcame all difficulties and restored traffic.
　　
　　In addition, the implementation of the responsibility system and the launch of the conservation movement by all employees of the Changsha Locomotive Depot of the Yuehan Railway has been effective. After the implementation of the responsible shift system in the train crew, the seven locomotives in the crew can save 80 tons of coal and more than 100 kilograms of oil per month. The team also switched to using rice straw to wipe the cars and hands, saving more than 100 kilograms of cotton yarn per month.

　　粤汉铁路北段通至临湘
    【新华社汉口二十六日电】粤汉铁路北段的蒲圻大桥和羊楼司桥均已于二十三日修复。现粤汉路北段自武昌至湖南临湘县一百八十公里间已正式通车。该路中段长沙以北通至汨罗、长沙以南通至渌口；临湘至汨罗间的桥梁亦均修复，不日即可接轨。蒲圻大桥于白匪崇禧匪部溃退时曾遭惨重破坏。经中国人民革命军事委员会铁道部工务局派员前往领导抢修，终于克服一切困难，修复通车。
    又：粤汉铁路长沙机务段全体员工实行负责制和开展节约运动已著成效。行车组实行负责包班制后，该组七辆机车，每月可省煤八十吨，省油料一百多公斤。该组并改用稻草擦车擦手，每月可节省棉纱一百多公斤。
