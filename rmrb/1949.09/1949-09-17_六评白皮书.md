　　Six Critiques of the White Paper

Chinese people should thank Mr. Acheson, the spokesperson for the American bourgeoisie, not only because Acheson clearly admitted the fact that America provided money and guns, Chiang Kai-shek provided the people, and they fought for America, killing Chinese people. This allows China's advanced elements to convincingly persuade the backward elements. Isn't it? Look, Acheson himself confessed that this great bloody war in recent years, which caused millions of Chinese to lose their lives, was systematically organized by American imperialism. Chinese people should also thank Acheson not only because Acheson openly declared that they would recruit so-called "democratic individualist" elements in China to organize America's fifth column, overthrow the people's government led by the Chinese Communist Party. This has alerted the Chinese people, especially those with liberal tendencies, to be careful not to fall for the American scheme, and to be vigilant everywhere against the conspiracies being carried out by American imperialism in secret. Chinese people should also thank Acheson because Acheson fabricated a large portion of modern Chinese history, and Acheson's historical viewpoint is precisely the viewpoint shared by some Chinese intellectuals, that is, the bourgeois idealist view of history. Refuting Acheson may benefit a large number of Chinese people by opening their eyes. It may be even more beneficial for those who hold the same or somewhat similar views as Acheson.

What is the modern Chinese history fabricated by Acheson? He first tries to explain the occurrence of the Chinese revolution from China's economic and ideological conditions. Here, he tells many myths.

Acheson said: "China's population doubled in the 18th and 19th centuries, thus becoming an unbearable pressure on China. The first problem that every Chinese government must face is solving the people's food problem. So far, no government has succeeded. The Nationalist Party attempted to solve this problem by formulating many land reform laws, some of which failed, and others were ignored. The National Government's current predicament is largely because it cannot supply China with sufficient food. Most of the CCP's propaganda consists of their promises to solve the land problem."

To uninformed Chinese people, this sounds somewhat plausible. Too many people, not enough food, leading to revolution. The Nationalist Party didn't solve the problem, and the Communist Party may not be able to either. "So far, no government has succeeded."

Is the occurrence of revolution due to overpopulation? Have all revolutions throughout history, both ancient and modern, been due to overpopulation? Have the many revolutions in China over thousands of years also been due to overpopulation? Was the American anti-British revolution 177 years ago also due to overpopulation? Acheson's historical knowledge is equal to zero; he hasn't even read the American Declaration of Independence. The reason why Washington and Jefferson launched the anti-British revolution was because the British oppressed and exploited the Americans, not because of any American overpopulation. The reason why the Chinese people overthrew their feudal dynasties in the past was because these feudal dynasties oppressed and exploited the people, not because of any overpopulation. The reason why the Russians launched the February Revolution and the October Revolution was because of the oppression and exploitation of the Tsar and the Russian bourgeoisie, not because of any overpopulation. Russia still has far more land than people. Outer Mongolia has such vast land and such a sparse population that, according to Acheson's logic, it is unthinkable that a revolution would occur, but it has already happened.

According to Acheson, China has no way out. With a population of 475 million, it is an "unbearable pressure." Whether there is revolution or not, it is a disaster anyway. Acheson places great hope here, a hope he doesn't explicitly state, but which is often revealed by many American journalists. This is the so-called idea that the Chinese Communist Party cannot solve its own economic problems, China will always be in chaos, and only reliance on American flour, i.e., becoming an American colony, can offer a way out.

Why did the Xinhai Revolution fail to succeed and not solve the food problem? It was because the Xinhai Revolution only overthrew the Qing Dynasty, without overthrowing the oppression and exploitation of imperialism and feudalism.

Why did the Northern Expedition fail to succeed and not solve the food problem? It was because Chiang Kai-shek betrayed the revolution, surrendered to imperialism, and became a counter-revolutionary leader who oppressed and exploited the Chinese people.

"So far, no government has succeeded"? Do the old liberated areas in the Northwest, North China, Northeast, and East China, which have solved the land problem, still have the "food problem" as Acheson says? America has many spies or so-called observers in China. Why haven't they even discovered this? The unemployment problem in Shanghai and other places, which is the food problem, is entirely the result of the cruel and merciless oppression and exploitatation of imperialism, feudalism, bureaucratic capitalism, and the Kuomintang reactionary government . Under a People's Government, it will only take a few years to completely solve the unemployment problem, which is the food problem, just like in North China and Northeast China.

China's large population is a great thing. It is entirely possible to support many times more people. The solution is production. The fallacies of Western bourgeois economists such as Malthus, who claim that food increases cannot keep up with population increases, have not only been theoretically refuted by Marxists long ago, but have also been completely refuted by the facts of the post-revolutionary Soviet Union and the liberated areas of China. Based on the truth that revolution plus production can solve the food problem, the CCP Central Committee has ordered the Communist Party organizations and the People's Liberation Army throughout the country to retain all old Kuomintang staff who have skills and are not known to be reactionary or have notorious records, without reducing their numbers. In times of great difficulty, share food and crowd housing. Those who have been laid off and have no means of livelihood should have their orders rescinded and be given food. Those who have revolted or been captured from the Kuomintang army should be accepted according to this principle. All non-chief reactionary elements should be given a way out in life as long as they repent.

Of all things in the world, people are the most precious. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, as long as there are people, any human miracle can be created. We are the rebutters of Acheson's counter-revolutionary theory. We believe that revolution can change everything. A new China with a large population, abundant resources, a prosperous life, and a flourishing culture will arrive before long. All pessimistic arguments are completely unfounded.

"The Western Impact," is the second reason Acheson explains for the occurrence of the Chinese revolution. Acheson said: "For more than three thousand years, China has developed its own high culture and civilization, mostly unaffected by foreign forces. Even after being conquered by force, the Chinese have often been able to eventually suppress and assimilate the invaders. Therefore, they would naturally regard themselves as the center of the world and the highest expression of civilized people. In the mid-19th century, this Chinese wall of isolation, which had been impassable until then, was broken through by the West. These foreigners brought an aggressiveness, a unique Western technological development, and a high culture not brought into China by previous foreign invaders. Partly because of these qualities, partly because of the decline of Qing rule, Westerners were not only not assimilated by the Chinese, but also introduced new ideas to the Chinese. These new ideas played an important role in stimulating unrest and unease."

To uninformed Chinese people, Acheson sounds somewhat plausible. Western new ideas were imported into China, causing a revolution. Ideas can cause revolution; this is typical historical idealism.

Whose revolution is it? "Because of the decline of Qing rule," attacking weaknesses, it is a revolution against the Qing Dynasty. Acheson lied here. The Xinhai Revolution was a revolution against imperialism. The reason why the Chinese wanted to revolt against the Qing Dynasty was because the Qing Dynasty was a running dog of imperialism. The Opium War against British aggression, the war against the Anglo-French Allied forces' invasion, the Taiping Rebellion against the imperialist running dog Qing Dynasty, the war against French aggression, the war against Japanese aggression, the war against the Eight-Nation Alliance invasion all failed. Therefore, there was another Xinhai Revolution against the imperialist running dog Qing Dynasty. This is modern Chinese history up to the Xinhai Revolution. What is the "Western Impact" that Acheson speaks of? It is what Marx and Engels said in the "Communist Manifesto" (1848): the Western bourgeoisie used barbaric methods to transform the world according to their own image. In this process of impact or transformation, the Western bourgeoisie needed compradors and slaves who were familiar with Western customs, and had to allow countries like China, i.e., colonies and semi-colonies, to open schools and send students abroad, "introducing new ideas to the Chinese." This also led to the emergence of the national bourgeoisie and the proletariat who understood modern technology in countries like China. At the same time, it bankrupted the peasants, creating a vast semi-proletariat. In this way, the Western bourgeoisie created two types of people in the East: a small number who served the Western bourgeoisie, i.e., imperialism; and a large number who resisted imperialism, including the working class, the peasant class, the petty bourgeoisie, the national bourgeoisie, and revolutionary intellectuals from these classes. All of these are gravediggers that imperialism created for itself, and revolution arose from these people. It is not simply the input of Western ideas that caused unrest, but the invasion of imperialism that caused resistance.

In this resistance movement, for a very long period, from the Opium War in 1840 to the eve of the "May Fourth" Movement in 1919, a total of more than seventy years, the Chinese people had no ideological weapons to resist imperialism. The old, stubborn feudalist culture was defeated, could not resist, and declared bankruptcy. The Chinese were forced to learn evolutionary theory, the theory of natural human rights, and the ideas of bourgeois republics and other ideological weapons and political plans from the Western bourgeoisie's arsenal during the age of revolution. They organized political parties and launched revolutions, thinking that they could resist foreign powers externally and build a republic internally. However, like feudalist culture, it was very weak, could not resist, and was defeated, declaring bankruptcy.

The Russian Revolution of 1917 awakened the Chinese people. The Chinese learned something new: Marxism-Leninism. The emergence of the Communist Party in China was a major event that opened up the world. Sun Yat-sen also advocated "learning from Russia" and advocated "alliance with Russia and the Communist Party." In short, from then on, China changed direction.

Acheson is the spokesperson for the imperialist government, and of course he is unwilling to mention imperialism at all. He describes imperialist aggression as: "Foreigners bring an aggressiveness." Look, what a beautiful name: "aggressiveness." Chinese people learned this "aggressiveness," not to advance to Britain or America, but simply to cause their own "unrest," i.e., to revolt against imperialism and its running dogs in their own country. Unfortunately, no one succeeded, and they were all defeated by the inventors of "aggressiveness," i.e., the imperialists. So they turned their heads to learn something else, and strangely enough, they were effective as soon as they learned it.

"The Chinese Communist Party was organized in the early 1920s under the ideological influence of the Soviet revolution." Acheson is right. This ideology is none other than Marxism-Leninism. Compared with the Western bourgeoisie's "high culture not brought into China by previous foreign invaders" that Acheson speaks of, this ideology is many times higher. Its obvious and great effectiveness is that, compared with China's old feudalist culture, the Western bourgeoisie's culture, which can be proudly regarded by Achesons as "high culture," will be defeated as soon as it encounters the Marxist-Leninist culture, i.e., the scientific theory of social revolution, learned by the Chinese people. The new culture of scientific social revolution learned by the Chinese people defeated the imperialist running dog, the Northern Warlords, in the first battle; in the second battle, it defeated another imperialist running dog, Chiang Kai-shek's obstruction on the 25,000-li Long March; in the third battle, it defeated Japanese imperialism and its running dog, Wang Jingwei; and in the fourth battle, it finally ended the rule of the United States and all imperialism in China and all the reactionary forces, including its running dog Chiang Kai-shek and others.

The reason why Marxism-Leninism has had such a great effect since its arrival in China is because Chinese social conditions have this need, because it is connected with the Chinese revolution, and because it has been mastered by the Chinese people. This is the opposite of the situation in which Western bourgeois culture is incompatible with Chinese social conditions. Any ideology, if it is not related to objective reality, if there is no objective need, if it is not mastered by the people, even if it is the best thing, even if it is Marxism-Leninism, it is useless. We are historical materialists who oppose historical idealism.

Very strange, "Soviet theories and practices have had considerable influence on Sun Yat-sen's thoughts and principles, especially in the economic and party organization aspects." What about the influence of the "high culture" of the West, which is proudly regarded by Achesons, on Mr. Sun? Acheson didn't say. Sun Yat-sen spent most of his life searching for the truth of saving the country from Western bourgeois culture, but the result was disappointment, and he turned to "learning from Russia." Is this a coincidence? Obviously not. Mr. Sun and the suffering Chinese people he represented were all angered by the "Western Impact" and determined to "ally with Russia and the Communist Party" to fight desperately with imperialism and its running dogs. Of course, it was not a coincidence. Here, Acheson does not dare to say that the Soviets were imperialist aggressors and that Sun Yat-sen was learning from the aggressors. Well, then, Sun Yat-sen can learn from the Soviets, and the Soviets are not imperialist aggressors. Why can't Sun Yat-sen's successors, the Chinese people after Sun Yat-sen's death, learn from the Soviets? Why do Chinese people other than Sun Yat-sen learn the scientific theory of social revolution from Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, and combine it with Chinese characteristics, launch the Chinese People's Liberation War and the People's Great Revolution, and create a People's Democratic Dictatorship Republic, which is called "controlled by the Soviet Union," "the Fifth Column of the Communist International," and "running dogs of Red imperialism"? Is there such a brilliant logic in the world?

Since the Chinese people learned Marxism-Leninism, i.e., the scientific theory of social revolution, the Chinese people have changed from passive to active in spirit. From this time on, the era in modern world history when people looked down on the Chinese and Chinese culture should come to an end. The great victorious Chinese People's Liberation War and the People's Great Revolution have revived and are continuing to revive the culture of the great Chinese people. This culture of the Chinese people, in its spiritual aspect, has surpassed the entire capitalist world. For example, the level of understanding of modern China and the modern world of people like US Secretary of State Acheson is below that of an ordinary soldier in the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

Up to this point, Acheson, with the posture of a bourgeois university professor lecturing on boring textbooks, shows people that he is seeking the cause and effect of the Chinese Incident. The reason why China had a revolution was because of the large population and the stimulation of Western ideas. Look, he is a causalist. Next, even this boring, fabricated causal relationship disappears, and a lot of inexplicable incidents appear. The Chinese just fight each other and suspect and hate each other for no reason. The contrast between the spiritual strength of the two sides of the struggle has undergone inexplicable changes. One side has declined to the extreme, falling below zero, and the other side has risen to the extreme, rising to the point of fanaticism. What is the reason? No one knows -- this is the logic inherent in America's "high culture." To know the details, wait for the analysis.

　　六评白皮书
    中国人之所以应当感谢美国资产阶级发言人艾奇逊，不但因为艾奇逊明确地供认了美国出钱出枪、蒋介石出人、替美国打仗杀中国人的这样一种事实，使得中国的先进分子有证据地去说服落后分子。不是么，你们看，艾奇逊自己招认了，最近数年的这一场使得几百万中国人丧失生命的大血战，是美国帝国主义有计划地组织成功的。中国人之所以应当感谢艾奇逊，又不但因为艾奇逊公开宣称他们要招收中国的所谓“民主个人主义”分子，组织美国的第五纵队，推翻中国共产党领导的人民政府，因此引起了中国人特别是那些带有自由主义色彩的中国人的注意，大家相约不要上美国人的当，到处警戒美帝国主义在暗地里进行的阴谋活动。中国人之所以应当感谢艾奇逊，还因为艾奇逊胡诌了一大篇中国近代史，而艾奇逊的历史观点正是中国知识分子中有一部分人所同具的观点，就是说资产阶级的唯心的历史观。驳斥了艾奇逊，就有可能使得广大的中国人获得打开眼界的利益。对于那些抱着和艾奇逊相同、或者有某些相同的观点的人们，则可能是更加有益处的。
    艾奇逊胡诌的中国近代史是什么呢？他首先试图从中国的经济状况和思想状况去说明中国革命之发生。在这里他讲了很多的神话。
    艾奇逊说：“中国的人口，在十八、十九世纪中增加了一倍，因此对于中国成为一种不堪重负的压力。每一个中国政府必须面临的第一个问题，是解决人民的吃饭问题。到现在为止，没有一个政府成功。国民党曾企图用制定许多土地改革法令的方式解决这个问题，这些法律中有的失败了，另外的则遭忽视。国民政府今日所面临的难境，大部分正是因为它不能以充分的粮食供给中国。中共宣传的大部分，就是由他们将解决土地问题的诺言所组成”。
    在不明事理的中国人看来，很有点象。人口太多了，饭少了，发生革命，国民党没有解决这个问题，共产党也不见得能解决这个问题，“到现在为止，没有一个政府成功”。
    革命的发生是由于人口太多的原故么？古今中外有过很多的革命，都是由于人口太多么？中国几千年以来的很多次革命，也是由于人口太多么？美国一百七十七年前的反英革命，也是由于人口太多么？艾奇逊的历史知识等于零，他连美国独立宣言也没有读过。华盛顿杰佛逊们之所以举行反英革命，是因为英国人压迫和剥削美国人，而不是什么美国人口过剩。中国人民历次推翻自己的封建朝廷，是因为这些封建朝廷压迫和剥削人民，而不是什么人口过剩。俄国人所以举行二月革命和十月革命，是因为俄皇和俄国资产阶级的压迫和剥削，而不是什么人口过剩，俄国至今还是土地多过人口很远的。外蒙古土地那么广大，人口那么稀少，照艾奇逊的道理是不能设想会发生革命的，但是却早已发生了。
    按照艾奇逊，中国是毫无出路的，人口有了四万万七千五百万，是一种“不堪重负的压力”，革命也好，不革命也好，总之是不得了。艾奇逊在这里寄予了很大的希望，这个希望他没有说出来，而却被许多美国新闻记者经常透露出来，这就是所谓中国共产党解决不了自己的经济问题，中国将永远是天下大乱，只有靠美国的面粉，即是说变为美国的殖民地，才有出路。
    辛亥革命为什么没有成功，没有解决吃饭问题呢？是因为辛亥革命只推翻一个满清朝廷，而没有推翻帝国主义和封建主义的压迫和剥削。
    北伐战争为什么没有成功，没有解决吃饭问题呢？是因为蒋介石背叛革命，投降帝国主义，成了压迫和剥削中国人的反革命首领。
    “到现在为止没有一个政府成功”么？西北、华北、东北、华东各个解决了土地问题的老解放区，难道还有如同艾奇逊所说那样的“吃饭问题”存在么？美国在中国的侦探或所谓观察家是不少的，为什么连这件事也没有探出来呢？上海等处的失业问题即吃饭问题，完全是帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义和国民党反动政府的残酷无情的压迫和剥削的结果。在人民政府下，只消几年工夫，就可以和华北、东北等处一样完全解决失业即吃饭问题。
    中国人口广大是一件极大的好事。再增加多少倍人口也完全有办法，这办法就是生产。西方资产阶级经济学家如象马尔萨斯者流所谓食物增加赶不上人口增加的一套谬论，不但被马克思主义者早已从理论上驳斥得干干净净，而且已被革命后的苏联和中国解放区的事实所完全驳斥。根据革命加生产即能解决吃饭问题的真理，中共中央已命令全国各地的共产党组织和人民解放军，对于国民党的旧工作人员，只要有一技之长而不是反动有据或劣迹昭著的分子，一概予以维持，不要裁减。十分困难时，饭匀着吃，房子挤着住。已被裁减而生活无着者，收回成命，给以饭吃。国民党军起义的或被俘的，按此原则，一律收留。凡非首要的反动分子，只要悔罪，亦须给以生活出路。
    世间一切事物中，人是第一个可宝贵的。在共产党领导下，只要有了人，什么人间奇迹也可以造出来。我们是艾奇逊反革命理论的驳斥者，我们相信革命能改变一切，一个人口众多、物产丰盛、生活优裕、文化昌盛的新中国，不要很久就可以到来，一切悲观论调是完全没有根据的。
    “西方的冲击”，这是艾奇逊解释中国革命所以发生的第二个原因。艾奇逊说：“三千余年以来，中国发展他们自己的高度的文化与文明，多半未受外来势力的影响。甚至受武力征服之后，中国人还往往能在最后镇压并同化侵入者。因此，他们自然会自视为世界中心以及文明人的最高表现。在十九世纪中叶，这座中国的孤立的到那时为止一直不能通过的墙，被西方突破了。这些外来者带来一种进取性、独一无二的西方技术发展和一种为以前的外国侵入者所未带入中国的高度文化。一部分因为这些性质，一部分因为满清统治的衰微，西方人不但没有被中国同化，反而为中国人介绍新观念。这些新观念，在刺激骚乱和不安方面，占了一种重要位置。”
    在不明事理的中国人看来，艾奇逊说得很有点象。西方的新观念输入了中国，引起了革命。观念可以引起革命，这是典型的历史唯心论。
    革什么人的命呢？“因为满清统治的衰微”，向弱点进攻，是革满清的命了。艾奇逊在这里说了谎。辛亥革命是革帝国主义的命。中国人所以要革满清的命，是因为满清是帝国主义的走狗。反对英国侵略的鸦片战争，反对英法联军侵略的战争，反对帝国主义走狗满清朝廷的太平天国战争，反对法国侵略的战争，反对日本侵略的战争，反对八国联军侵略的战争，都失败了，于是再有反对帝国主义走狗满清朝廷的辛亥革命，这就是到辛亥为止的近代中国史。艾奇逊所说的“西方的冲击”是什么呢？就是马克思恩格斯在“共产党宣言”（一八四八年）中所说的西方资产阶级按照自己面貌用野蛮的方法去改造世界。在这个冲击或改造过程中，西方资产阶级需要买办和熟习西方习惯的奴才，不得不允许中国这一类国家即殖民地和半残民地开办学校和派遣留学生，“为中国人介绍新观念”。随着也就产生了中国这类国家的民族资产阶级和懂得现代技术的无产阶级。同时并使农民破产，造成了广大的半无产阶级。这样，西方资产阶级就在东方造成了两类人，一类是少数人，这就是为西方资产阶级即帝国主义服务的洋奴。一类是多数人，这就是反抗帝国主义的工人阶级，农民阶级，小资产阶级，民族资产阶级和从这些阶级出身的革命知识分子。所有这些，都是帝国主义替自己造成的掘墓人，革命就是从这些人发生的。不是什么单纯的西方思想的输入引起了骚乱，而是帝国主义的侵略引起了反抗。
    在这个反抗运动中，在一个很长的时期内，即从一八四○年的鸦片战争到一九一九年“五四”运动的前夜，共计七十多年中，中国人没有什么思想武器可以抗御帝国主义。旧的顽固的封建主义文化打了败仗了，抵不住，宣告破产了。不得已，中国人被迫从帝国主义的老家即西方资产阶级革命时代的武器库中学来了进化论，天赋人权论和资产阶级共和国等项思想武器和政治方案，组织过政党，举行过革命，以为可以外御列强，内建民国。但是和封建主义文化一样，软弱得很，又是抵不住，败阵下来，宣告破产了。
    一九一七年的俄国革命唤醒了中国人，中国人学得了一样新东西，这就是马克思列宁主义。中国产生了共产党，这是开天辟地的大事变。孙中山也提倡“以俄为师”，主张“联俄联共”。总之是从此以后，中国改换了方向。
    艾奇逊是帝国主义政府的发言人，他当然一个字也不愿意提到帝国主义。他将帝国主义的侵略，说成：“外来者带来一种进取性。”看呵，多么美丽的名称：“进取性”。中国人学了这种“进取性”，不是进取到英国或美国去，只是引起了自己的“骚乱”，即在自己国土内革帝国主义及其走狗的命。可惜没有一次成功，都给“进取性”的发明人即帝国主义者打败了。于是掉转头去学别的东西，很奇怪，果然一学就灵。
    “中国共产党是在二十年代初期，在苏联革命的观念形态下组织的”。艾奇逊说对了。这个观念形态不是别的，就是马克思列宁主义。这个观念形态，和艾奇逊所说的西方资产阶级的“为以前的外国侵入者所未曾带入中国的高度文化”相比较，不知要高出几多倍。其明效大验，就是和中国旧的封建主义文化相比较可以被艾奇逊们傲视为“高度文化”的那种西方资产阶级的文化，一遇见中国人民学会了的马列主义文化，即科学的社会革命论，就要打败仗。被中国人民学会了的科学的社会革命新文化，第一仗打败了帝国主义的走狗北洋军阀，第二仗打败了帝国主义的又一名走狗蒋介石在二万五千里长征路上的拦阻，第三仗打败了日本帝国主义及其走狗汪精卫，第四仗最后结果了美国和一切帝国主义在中国的统治及其走狗蒋介石等一切反动派。
    马列主义来到中国之所以发生这样大的作用，是因为中国社会条件有了这种需要，是因为和中国革命发生了联系，是因为被中国人民所掌握了。这和西方资产阶级文化对于中国社会条件格格不入的情况是相反的。任何观念形态，如果不和客观实际事物相联系，如果没有客观存在的需要，如果不为人民群众所掌握，即使是最好的东西，即使是马列主义，也是没有用的。我们是反对历史唯心论的历史唯物论者。
    非常奇怪，“苏维埃的理论与实际，对于孙中山先生的思想和原则，尤其是经济方面和党的组织方面，有相当的影响”。被艾奇逊们所傲视的西方的“高度文化”，对于孙先生的影响怎么样呢？艾奇逊没有说。孙先生以大半辈子的光阴从西方资产阶级文化中寻找救国真理，结果是失望，转而“以俄为师”，这是一个偶然事件吗？显然不是。孙先生和他所代表的苦难的中国人民，一齐被“西方的冲击”所激怒，下决心“联俄联共”，和帝国主义及其走狗奋斗拼命，当然不是偶然的。在这里，艾奇逊不敢说苏联人是帝国主义侵略者，孙中山是向侵略者学习。那么，好了，孙中山可以向苏联人学习，而苏联人并非帝国主义侵略者，为什么孙中山的继承者，孙中山死后的中国人，就不可以向苏联人学习呢？为什么孙中山以外的中国人从马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林学了科学的社会革命理论，并使之和中国的特点相结合，发动了中国的人民解放战争和人民大革命，创立了人民民主专政的共和国，就叫做“受苏联控制”，“共产国际的第五纵队”，“赤色帝国主义的走狗”呢？世上有这样高明的逻辑吗？
    自从中国人学会了马列主义即科学的社会革命论以后，中国人在精神上就由被动转入主动。从这时起，近代世界历史上那种看不起中国人，看不起中国文化的时代应当完结了。伟大的胜利的中国人民解放战争和人民大革命，已经复兴了并正在继续复兴着伟大的中国人民的文化。这种中国人民的文化，就其精神方面来说，已经超过了整个资本主义世界。比方美国的国务卿艾奇逊之流，他们对于现代中国和现代世界的认识水平，就在中国人民解放军的一个普通战士以下。
    至此为止，艾奇逊以一个资产阶级大学教授讲述无聊课本的姿态，向人表示他在寻求中国事变的因果关系。中国之所以发生革命，一因人口太多，二因西方思想的刺激。你们看，他是一个因果论者。接下去，他就连这点无聊的伪造的因果论也不见了，出现了一大堆莫名其妙的事变。中国人就是那样毫无原因地互相争权夺利和猜疑仇恨。斗争双方的精神力量的对比，发生了莫名其妙的变化，一方极度下降，降到零度以下，另一方极度上升，升到狂热的程度。什么原因呢？谁也不知道——这就是美国的“高度文化”中所固有的逻辑。欲知其详，且待分解。
