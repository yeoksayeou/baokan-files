Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 2nd: TASS reports: The Austrian Communist Party and the League of Progressive Socialists (i.e., the Left-Wing Socialist Party) in Vienna held their first joint mass meeting on August 28th at the Engelmann Arena. Representatives attending the ongoing Austrian Communist Party National Congress also participated. More than 15,000 people filled the stands, and the streets outside, equipped with loudspeakers, were also crowded with people. Countless slogans and banners called for the consolidation of working-class unity. When Austrian Communist Party Chairman Koplenig and League of Progressive Socialists Chairman Schärf appeared on the podium, the audience greeted them with enthusiastic applause. The Chairman of the Vienna Branch of the League of Progressive Socialists, Haas, delivered the opening speech, emphasizing the great significance of this meeting in achieving working-class unity and pointing out that it was also a warning to those who wanted to plunge Austria into war and revive fascism. In his speech, Austrian Communist Party Chairman Koplenig pointed out that the joint meeting of the Communist Party and the League of Progressive Socialists confirmed that the forces determined to achieve democratic reforms in Austria had greatly increased. In the past four years, the two government parties – the "People's Party" and the "Socialist Party" – have not only developed a predatory capitalist economy but have also re-established poor management and corrupt systems in all sectors of the national economy and social life. To conceal these facts and divert the people's attention, they have launched unscrupulous slanderous propaganda against the people's democratic countries and the Soviet Union. But the people know that the enemy is not where the government parties point, but in our own country. This enemy is the reactionary coalition government that lies, deceives, and exploits the people; this enemy must be eliminated in the upcoming elections. Koplenig concluded by saying that in order to fight against the camp of capitalism and reactionary forces, the Communist Party and the League of Progressive Socialists have formed a left-wing alliance. They are confidently and hopefully moving towards the elections. Then, League of Progressive Socialists Chairman Schärf delivered a speech, saying that in 1945, the Austrian people were full of hope for rebuilding a new and democratic Austria. But disappointment awaited them. The leadership of the new Socialist Party fell into the hands of those who were responsible for the failure of the working class in 1934. Renner, Helmer, and Schärf, these deadly enemies of working-class unity, gained the leadership of the Socialist Party, and they did everything possible to provoke division in the working class and prevent the unity of all progressive forces. The meeting continued with speeches by League of Progressive Socialists Berg and Kutzel, and Communist Party member of parliament Fischer, who was warmly welcomed by the audience.

　　维也纳共产党与左翼社会党
  　联合举行群众大会
  　奥共主席斥责反动联合政府
    【新华社北平二日电】据塔斯社讯：奥地利维也纳共产党及进步社会党人联盟（按即左翼社会党）于八月二十八日在恩格尔曼圆形竞技场举行第一次联合主持的群众大会。正在开会的奥共全国代表会议的代表亦均参加。一万五千余人挤满了看台，附近装着扩音器的街道上也挤满了人民群众。无数的口号和标语号召巩固工人阶级的团结。当奥国共产党主席柯普利尼希及进步社会党人联盟主席夏尔夫在讲台出现时，听众报以狂热的欢迎。进步社会党人联盟维也纳支部主席哈斯致开幕词，强调这次大会在取得工人阶级团结方面的重大意义，并指出它同时也是对那些想把奥国投入战争及把法西斯主义复活的人的一个警告。奥共主席柯普利尼希在他的演词中指出：共产党及进步社会党人联盟的联合大会证实了决心在奥国实现民主改革的力量已大为增长。在过去四年中，两个政府党——“人民党”与“社会党”不仅发展了掠夺性的资本主义经济，并且也在全国经济及社会生活的各部门，重新建立了管理恶劣和腐败的制度。为了隐蔽这些事实，以转移人民的注意，他们便于人民民主国家与苏联发起了肆无忌惮的诽谤宣传。但是人民知道：敌人并不是在政府党所指的地方而是在我们自己的国家里面。这个敌人就是说谎、欺骗及剥削人民的反动的联合政府，这个敌人必须在即将到来的选举中被铲除掉。柯普利尼希最后称：为了对资本主义及反动势力的阵营进行斗争，共产党和进步党人联盟已组成左翼联盟。他们正有信心，有希望地走向选举。接着进步社会党人联盟主席夏尔夫发表演说称，在一九四五年，奥国人民曾经对重建新的民主奥国充满希望。但是失望等待着他们。新社会党的领导权落到那些应对一九三四年工人阶级的失败负责的人们的手中。伦纳、赫尔麦和侠夫，这些工人阶级团结的死敌，获得了社会党的领导地位，他们尽一切可能挑起工人阶级的分裂，并阻止一切进步力量的团结。大会继由进步社会党人联盟柏格及库茨尔及共产党的国会议员费希尔演讲，费希尔受到听众热烈的欢迎。
