Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 20th: Reporter Ding Shuqi reports on the latest situation in the Shanghai market, stating that since August, the value of the Renminbi in the Shanghai market has become increasingly stable, and bank and private bank deposits have increased significantly, indicating that the government's correct economic measures have achieved remarkable results.

The stability of the currency value is reflected in the stability of commodity prices. After prices stabilized and fell for three weeks in August, prices of yarn, cloth, cotton, rice, and other goods began to rebound from the 23rd, but the increase was not significant (the largest was only about 10%), and it was mainly due to seasonal factors and normal adjustments, without forming a price surge. Yarn and cloth first rebounded because the peak sales season had arrived and the exchange ratio with agricultural products had been too low in the past. Cotton, as the raw material for yarn and cloth, also rose accordingly. The rebound in rice prices was also the result of appropriate adjustments to rice prices in neighboring producing areas. Therefore, overall, Shanghai's prices have been stable since August.

The currency value stability, as reflected in stable prices, has led the general public to begin to change the mentality of valuing goods over currency that was created by successive hyperinflations under the "Legal Tender," "Central Reserve Certificates," and "Gold Yuan Certificates" over the past twelve years, and to re-establish the habit of saving money. At the end of July, the total deposits of private banks and private money shops were only 6.27 billion yuan, but by August 13, they had increased to 16 billion yuan, and now have reached over 20 billion yuan. The Shanghai Branch of the People's Bank of China started offering three types of fixed deposits for ten, twenty, and thirty days on the 25th, and absorbed 1.5 billion yuan in deposits in two days.

Before liberation, bureaucratic capitalists and other speculators took advantage of hyperinflation to stir up trouble in the speculative market, causing the market's credit to fluctuate, and prices to jump accordingly, leading to a more rapid devaluation of the currency, making it impossible for private banks and private money shops to develop normal business. After the liberation of Shanghai, in order to stabilize finance and establish a unified currency system with the Renminbi as the standard currency, the People's Government immediately severely cracked down on speculation in silver dollars after successfully redeeming the fake Gold Yuan Certificates. It uncovered the center of gold, silver, and foreign currency speculation in the stock exchange building, which had been disrupting finance and prices. The East China Military Region Headquarters successively promulgated the "Provisional Measures for Foreign Exchange Management in East China" and the "Provisional Measures for Gold and Silver Management in East China," strictly prohibiting the circulation and trading of gold, silver, and foreign currencies. The People's Bank also posted rates for redeeming silver dollars, set deadlines for depositing foreign currencies, and offered value-guaranteed savings. In this way, the Renminbi gradually and completely occupied the Shanghai market. Gold and silver currencies were not only completely excluded from the commodity circulation process, but also the remaining black market speculation lost its influence on prices. During the semi-annual settlement period for banks and private money shops at the end of June, the Financial Department of the Military Control Commission suspended the business of three banks and private money shops that failed to make up the shortage in bill exchange on time, which played a significant role in restricting credit expansion and stabilizing finance. In June and July, the phenomenon of tight and loose credit continued to exist, and interest rates, as an indicator of credit tightness, fluctuated three times with price fluctuations. However, since August, the above-mentioned financial measures, coupled with more effective currency control, increasingly smooth material exchanges, and increasingly strengthened market management, have led to stable prices, stable currency value, easing credit, and declining interest rates.

On this basis, the Shanghai Branch of the People's Bank of China, on the one hand, began to trial seven-day fixed deposits for banks and private money shops on August 12 to regulate short-term credit and temporarily solve the difficulty of capital utilization for private banks and private money shops, and started offering short-term fixed deposits on the 25th to absorb social capital; at the same time, it also opened inter-port discounting business to support the development of production and sales enterprises that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. The Bank of China has also started offering export loans in the form of inter-port discounting, packing loans, and fixed-term collateral loans for fourteen major export commodities such as tung oil, bristles, tea, and raw silk. In addition, the number of inland remittance locations of the Shanghai Branch of the People's Bank of China is increasing (now reaching more than 100) and preferential remittance methods have been stipulated. The China Property Insurance Company insures water and land transportation war risk, and the China Aviation United Insurance Company insures aviation employee accidental liability. At the same time, the East China Military Region announced the "Provisional Measures for the Management of Private Banks and Private Money Shops" on August 21, which was formulated after more than two months of soliciting opinions from various parties and careful deliberation. The negative purpose is to eliminate speculation and eliminate some banks and private money shops with weak capital strength, and at the same time, promote the banks and private money shops that have relied on hyperinflation and speculative markets to earn illegal profits to get on the right track; the positive purpose is to protect the banks and private money shops engaged in legitimate business, and increase their capital strength so that they can better start their business. The implementation of this method will further stabilize Shanghai's finance and further guarantee social credit. All these series of measures, coordinated with each other, will provide further strong support for Shanghai's production and sales businesses, in order to successfully overcome the current economic difficulties in the period of transformation.

### 人民币信用空前提高　上海市场日趋稳定  物资交流畅通银钱业存款增加

　　人民币信用空前提高
  　上海市场日趋稳定
    物资交流畅通银钱业存款增加
    【新华社北平二十日电】记者丁树奇报道最后的上海市场情势称：自八月以来，人民币币值在上海市场日趋稳定，银行钱庄存款大量增加，说明人民政府的各项正确的经济措施已获得显著成效。
    币值稳定，表现在物价平稳上面。八月内物价在稳跌三周之后，二十三日起纱、布、棉花、食米等价格相继止跌回涨，但上涨幅度不大（最大者不过一成左右），而且主要是由于季节性的原因和正常的调整作用，并未形成涨风。纱、布以实销旺月已届，加以过去与农产品的交换比率过低，所以这次首先回涨，作为纱、布原料的棉花也就连带上涨。食米回涨，也是与邻近产区米价适当调整的结果。所以整个说来，八月以来上海物价是平稳的。
    由于物价平稳所表现的币值稳定，使一般市民已开始改变十二年来由“法币”、“中储券”、“金圆券”等历次恶性通货膨胀所造成的重物轻币心理，开始重新建立储蓄货币的习惯。七月底，私营银行钱庄的存款总额仅六十二亿七千余万元，至八月十三日即增至一百六十亿元，现在已达二百亿元以上。人民银行上海分行于二十五日开始举办十天、二十天、三十天三种定期存款，两天工夫即吸收存款十五亿元。
    解放以前，官僚资本家和其他投机分子利用通货的恶性膨胀在投机市场兴风作浪，以致市场银根忽松忽紧，物价相应地不断跳动，促使通货更加迅速贬值，私营银钱业无法发展正常的业务。上海解放后，人民政府为了安定金融，确立以人民币为本位币的单一币制，在顺利收兑了伪金圆券之后，立即严重打击了银元投机风潮，在证券大楼破获了一向扰乱金融、物价的金银外币投机中枢，华东军区司令部又先后颁布了“华东区外汇管理暂行办法”和“华东区金银管理暂行办法”，严禁金银外币的流通买卖。人民银行并挂牌收兑银元、限期存兑外币、举办折实储蓄等。这样，人民币便逐步以至完全占领了上海市场，金银外币不但完全被排除于商品流通过程之外，而且残存的某些黑市投机交易也失去了影响物价的作用。六月底的行庄半年决算期中，军管会金融处对于不能按时补足票据交换缺额的三家行庄予以停业处分，在限制信用膨胀、安定金融上起了很大的作用。六、七两月，银根时松时紧的现象还继续存在，作为银根松紧指标的利率也曾随着物价的波动有过三次起伏。但自八月以来，上述各项金融措施，配合着更有效的通货控制、日益通畅的物资交流以及日益加强的市场管理，就出现了物价平稳、币值稳定、银根趋松、利率步降的现象。
    在这样的基础之上，人民银行上海分行一方面于八月十二日起试办银钱业七日定期存款，以调节短期信用，暂时解决私营银钱业资金运用的困难，二十五日起更举办短期性的定期存款，以吸收社会资金；同时，又开办埠际押汇业务，扶助有利于国计民生的生产运销事业的发展。中国银行对于桐油、猪鬃、茶叶、生丝等十四种主要出口物资也开始举办埠际押汇、打包放款、定期质押放款等方式的出口贷款。此外，人民银行上海分行内地通汇地点日益增多（现已达一百多处）并规定了通汇优待办法，中国产物保险公司承保水陆运输兵险，中国航联保险公司承保航业职工意外责任等保险。同时，华东军区于八月二十一日公布了“管理私营银钱业暂行办法”，这是经过两个多月多方征求意见和慎重商讨才制定的，其目的，消极方面在杜绝投机，淘汰一部分资力过弱的行庄，同时促使过去依赖通货膨胀和投机市场赚收非法利润的行庄走上正轨；积极方面在保障从事正当业务的行庄，并使其增加资力，以便更好地开始业务。这个办法的施行，将使上海金融进一步得到安定，社会信用进一步得到保障。所有这一系列的措施彼此配合，将给上海的生产、运销事业以进一步的有力扶助，以便胜利地克服目前蜕变期中的上海经济困难。
