Hebei Non-Disaster Areas Such as Anguo and Wangdu Counties
　　Autumn Harvest Looks Promising
(Reported by this newspaper) This reporter, during an interview, traveled through dozens of villages and towns in non-disaster areas of Anguo, Dingxian, Boye, Qingyuan, Wangdu and other counties. What I saw along the way was beautiful autumn crops, lush green fields, stretching as far as the eye could see, a scene of abundant harvest everywhere. When this reporter was chatting with some old farmers in Anguo County, they said, "This year is really a year of timely winds and rains," "It's hard to buy a dry May with money, a continuous rainy June fills the stomach." Although there was a period of rain shortage in May this year, since June, the wind and rain have been well-distributed, the autumn crops are lush and strong, so deep that they can engulf people, the best in the past decade. If no major disasters occur again, a good harvest is expected this year. Farmers in Nanloudi Village (second-class village), in the first district, when asked by this reporter about the benefits they have received since the land reform, they talked about the following four points: First, all farmers in the village have land to cultivate, and they have also turned over politically, becoming their own masters, no longer oppressed and exploited by landlords and rich peasants. This year's wheat harvest was very good, and there is hope for a good autumn harvest. War service and errands have also been reduced, everyone has enough to eat and wear, and life is happy; Second, landlords and rich peasants have also been allocated land in the land reform and have turned to labor production. Some, in addition to agriculture, also engage in sideline occupations, setting up small stalls, women doing needlework to earn money, and their lives are now guaranteed. These people who used to exploit and oppress others have now turned to labor production, which is an unprecedented event; Third, the original idlers and lazy people in the village have also been reformed and participated in production, and there are no more people who live by sponging off others; Fourth, there are no more thieves, beggars, or gambling ghosts, and the phenomenon of fighting and quarreling has also decreased. The whole village is united and harmonious, engaged in labor production, and the appearance of the countryside is brand new. This is only the situation in the second-class village. Other first-class villages such as Dazhang and Yancun have done even better in terms of intensive farming, mutual assistance in cultivation, and fertilizer accumulation. Many farm families buy coal to burn, use wheat roots to make compost, and raise pigs and grow green manure in greater numbers. In Dazhang Village, the number of pig-raising households reaches 90% of the village population. Wells, waterwheels, and livestock have generally increased. Before the war, Sixia Village had 103 head of livestock, 100 waterwheels, 180 carts, and 183 wells. By July of this year, the number had increased to 193 head of livestock, 139 waterwheels, 185 carts, and 210 wells. In terms of hoeing, this year everyone has generally hoed one or two more times than last year, so this year's wheat season yield has generally increased. Last year, Sixia Village averaged 1.3 dou per mu of irrigated land, and this year it produced 1.9 dou. The living standards of farmers are gradually improving. For example, the poor peasant Zhang Ruike used to have only three mu of land, and he harvested eight to nine bags of grain each year, which was not enough for his five or six family members. Every year he had to go to Raoyang to burn kilns; after the land reform, he added more than ten mu of land, and he can harvest more than forty bags of grain each year. In addition to eating and drinking, he has surplus grain, plus income from sideline occupations, his life is more prosperous. This year, the crops are very good in non-disaster areas of Hebei Province. Although insect pests and floods have been discovered successively in various places, they have been mostly suppressed and rescued. If they do not continue to spread, there will be no problem with a good harvest.

　　河北非灾区安国望都等县
  　秋禾可望丰收
    【本报讯】此次记者于采访中，历经安国、定县、博野、清苑、望都等县非灾区数十村镇，沿途所见，秋禾丰美，遍野青翠，一望无际，到处一片丰收景象。当记者在安国县与几个老农交谈中，他们说：“今年真是个五风十雨的年景”，“有钱难买五月旱，六月连霪吃饱饭。”今年五月份虽一度缺雨，但六月以来即风雨调匀，秋禾丰美肥壮，深可没人，为十年来所仅有。如不再发生大的灾害，今年可望丰收。一区南楼底村（二等村）农民，在记者问到他们自土地改革以来得到那些好处时，他谈出的有这样四点：第一、全村农民都有地种了，在政治上也翻了身，自己当家作主人，再不受地主富农的压迫剥削了。今年麦收很好，秋季又有丰收希望，战勤支差也少了，大家都有吃有穿，生活愉快；第二、地主富农在土改中也分得了土地，转入了劳动生产，有的除农业之外，还兼搞副业，摆小摊、妇女作针线活赚钱，生活已有保障。这些过去剥削和压迫人的人，现在已转入了劳动生产，这是从来没有过的大事；第三、村里原有的二流子、懒汉也都改造过来，参加了生产，再没有勤吃坐穿的人了；第四、没有了小偷、乞丐、赌博鬼，打架闹架的现象也少了，全村团结和睦、劳动生产，农村面貌一新。这仅是二等村的情况。其他一等村如大章、阎村等村，在精耕细作、互助代耕、积肥等方面，就做得更好。不少农家买煤烧，将麦根沤粪，养猪、压绿肥也大有增加。大章村养猪户达全村人口百分之九十，水井、水车、牲口，普遍都有增加。寺下村战前有牲口一○三头，水车一○○辆，大车一八○辆，水井一八三眼，到今年七月增加到牲口一九三头，水车一三九辆，大车一八五辆，水车二一○辆。在锄地方面，今年普遍的都比去年多锄一遍或两遍，因而今年麦季产量普遍提高。去年寺下村每亩水地平均产一石三斗，今年产一石九斗。农民生活水平逐渐提高。如贫农张瑞科过去只有三亩地，每年打粮食八—九口袋，五六口人不够吃，每年不得不到饶阳一带去烧窑；土改后添了十多亩地，每年可打四十多口袋粮食，一年吃喝之外尚有余粮，加上副业收入，生活更加富裕。今年河北省非灾区各地庄稼都很好，各地虽先后发现虫害、水灾，已大部扑灭、抢救，如不再继续扩展，丰收当无问题。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（本报河北农村考察组）
