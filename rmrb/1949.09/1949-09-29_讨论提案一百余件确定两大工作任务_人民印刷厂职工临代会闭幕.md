    The factory's Workers' Temporary Representative Meeting opened on August 19th and lasted for ten consecutive days. The 91 worker representatives present put forward over a hundred proposals related to production and welfare and personnel matters. The meeting was adjourned for more than 20 days due to the study and handling of proposals and the handling of the sabotage of machinery by saboteur An Qingyu. It resumed on September 22nd. On the first day of the resumption, Wei Xiaotian, Secretary of the factory's General Party Branch and Chairman of the meeting, spoke first. He explained that reasonable proposals that can be resolved at present will be resolved immediately; generally reasonable proposals that cannot be resolved at present will be explained by the administration and the trade union regarding the reasons why they cannot be resolved at present; and some proposals are fundamentally incorrect and unreasonable, and cannot be resolved and should be appropriately criticized. Subsequently, Wang Ji, Director of the factory's Trade Union Preparatory Committee, answered various proposals related to the trade union, such as the cafeteria, cooperative, and clinic, which have been improved or established; in terms of workers' cultural entertainment, preparations are being actively made to establish a club. Then, factory director He Xiaochu explained the various proposals that have been resolved or are being resolved administratively. (1) In terms of production: (1) The issue of increasing and repairing workshops is being planned and constructed. (2) Accept the motion to strengthen production management and establish various systems, and simplify procedures. (3) Regarding the adjustment of manpower, working hours, and equipment, it has been studied and handled separately. (2) Personnel issues: According to the opinions of the representatives, the handling methods are divided into three types: (1) Among the old personnel to be retained, those with political problems and hated by the masses, such as special agents Huang Shuming and Wang Wanzhong, have been expelled or sent to the government for legal action; (2) Those who the masses have opinions on, and those who have bad work styles and are opposed by the masses, will be strengthened with education to make them repent and strive for reform. (3) Individual cadres with bad work styles have also been criticized separately. (3) Wage issues: Unreasonable wages will be adjusted. A wage adjustment committee will be formed after the meeting to complete the wage adjustment work by the end of October. (4) Work clothes issues: Issued according to work needs.

The general requirements are: improve production quantity and quality, carry out the save movement, promote a high degree of production enthusiasm and persist in it, establish preliminary production standards, revise production systems, work systems, and adjust the organization, and gradually establish cost accounting.
