　　At the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference
　　Speech by
　　Zhu De, Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese People's Liberation Army
    I, on behalf of the delegation of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, declare that we unanimously endorse the draft Organic Law of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the draft Organic Law of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, and the draft Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. The Chinese People's Liberation Army is willing to resolutely abide by the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and, under the leadership of the Central People's Government, to strive for the complete realization of this program.
    From the very first day of its establishment, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has regarded serving the people as its sole purpose. For twenty-two years, the people of the whole country have recognized that our army is the people's army. The people of the whole country have cooperated with us, and thus we have defeated the aggression of Japanese imperialism, defeated the attacks of the Kuomintang reactionaries aided by American imperialism, and are now eliminating the last remnants of the enemy and completing the great task of liberating and unifying the whole of China.
    The Common Program requires that the revolutionary war be carried through to the end, liberating all of China's territory, including Taiwan, Penghu, Hainan Island, and Tibet. Today, I assure you that we will resolutely do so.
    The Common Program requires the People's Liberation Army and all people's armed forces to defend China's independence and territorial integrity, and to protect the revolutionary achievements and all legitimate rights and interests of the Chinese people. Today, I assure you that we will faithfully do so.
    The Common Program requires the establishment of a unified people's army, implementing unified command, unified system, unified organization, and unified discipline. The Common Program also requires that the People's Army should continue to strengthen itself militarily and politically, strengthen the modernization of the army, build air and naval forces, and educate the commanders and fighters of the troops with revolutionary spirit and patriotism. Today, I assure you that we will resolutely do so, and we must build a unified, modernized, and politically steadfastly people's army that serves the people. Only such an army can defend our great motherland and people.
    Chairman Mao Zedong told us that our army is the most important weapon of our people's democratic state against internal and external reactionary conspiracies for restoration. Domestically, our army will never allow any counter-revolutionaries to continue to sabotage and disrupt, endangering the interests of the people. Internationally, our army will never allow any foreign aggressors to infringe upon an inch of our great motherland's territory. I earnestly hope that all representatives of the People's Political Consultative Conference, all democratic parties and people's organizations, and all patriotic people throughout the country can continue to assist the People's Liberation Army in carrying out the above-mentioned tasks. I firmly believe that under the leadership of Chairman Mao, and with the assistance of the people of the whole country, our People's Liberation Army and all people's armed forces will surely realize all the wishes of the People's Political Consultative Conference and carry out all the orders of the Central People's Government.

　　中国人民政协会议上
  　中国人民解放军
  　朱总司令发言
    我代表中国人民解放军代表团，宣布我们一致拥护中国人民政治协商会议组织法草案，中华人民共和国中央人民政府组织法草案和中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领草案。中国人民解放军愿意坚决服从中国人民政治协商会议的共同纲领，并在中央人民政府领导之下，为完全实现这个纲领而奋斗。
    中国人民解放军从产生的第一天起，就把为人民服务当作自己的唯一宗旨。二十二年来全国人民已经认识我们的军队是人民的军队，全国人民和我们合作，因此就战胜了日本帝国主义的侵略，战胜了美帝国主义所援助的国民党反动派的进攻，并且正在消灭最后的残敌，完成解放和统一全中国的伟大事业。
    共同纲领要求把革命战争进行到底，解放全中国的领土，包括台湾、澎湖、海南岛和西藏在内。我今天向大家保证：我们一定坚决地这样去做。
    共同纲领要求人民解放军和一切人民武装力量保卫中国的独立和领土主权的完整，保卫中国人民的革命成果和一切合法权益。我今天向大家保证：我们一定忠实地这样去做。
    共同纲领要求建立统一的人民军队，实行统一的指挥，统一的制度，统一的编制，统一的纪律。共同纲领又要求人民军队应当在军事上和政治上继续加强，加强现代化的陆军，建设空军和海军，以革命精神和爱国精神教育部队的指挥员和战斗员。我今天向大家保证：我们一定坚决地这样做，一定要建立一支统一的、现代化的、政治上坚定地为人民服务的强大的人民军队，只有这样的军队，保卫我们的伟大的祖国和人民。
    毛泽东主席告诉我们：我们的军队是我们人民民主国家对付内外反动阴谋复辟的最重要武器。对于国内来说，我们的军队决不允许任何反革命分子继续破坏捣乱，危害人民利益。对于国外来说，我们的军队决不允许任何外国侵略者侵犯我们伟大祖国的一寸土地。我恳切地希望人民政协的全体代表，全国各民主党派人民团体和全国一切爱国人民，能够继续援助人民解放军执行上面所说的各项任务。我坚决地相信，在毛主席领导之下，在全国人民的援助之下，我们的人民解放军和一切人民武装力量，一定能够实现人民政协的一切愿望，执行中央人民政府的一切命令。
