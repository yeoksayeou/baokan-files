Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 15th -- In the inaugural issue of the "Study" monthly published in Beiping, Ai Siqi published an article titled "Starting from Scratch," discussing preliminary methods for studying Marxism-Leninism. In this article, Ai Siqi, based on the recent experiences of study movements in various regions, particularly in major cities that had recently been liberated, put forward some summarizing opinions. He pointed out that the current study of Marxism-Leninism "should still be a period of starting from scratch." He said: "The steps taken by the current study movements in many places are precisely in line with this situation. For example, generally, the history of social development—historical materialism—is taken as the main content of the first step of study. In a short period of one to three months, concentrate efforts to conduct a relatively in-depth study of this course, without seeking to read too many books, without necessarily listening to many lectures and reports, and without rushing to obtain knowledge of all aspects of Marxist-Leninist theory and policy, but only seeking to establish several basic Marxist viewpoints relatively systematically through the study of the history of social development—historical materialism: First, the idea that labor creates the world; second, the idea of class struggle; and third, the Marxist theory of the state. Mastering these basic viewpoints often enables one to solve many problems that are not understood or cannot be figured out. Further advancing from this point, whether participating in work or continuing deeper study, there is great convenience. Experience has proven that this kind of concentrated, refined learning step has a great effect for those who start from scratch. However, a learning step that arranges many complex courses, listens to lectures and reports continuously every day, and squeezes the time for discussion and digestion to almost zero has a very small effect."

Regarding how to link theory with practice in preliminary study, Ai Siqi said in the article: "The easiest way to link study with practice in the first step is to link it with one's own thinking, that is, to apply the Marxist-Leninist theory learned to solve one's own ideological problems. While studying theory, one should constantly reflect on one's own thoughts and work, and compare one's own thoughts with the theory one has learned. In this way, one will find that one's various thoughts are often different from, or even completely contradictory to, Marxism-Leninism. Discovering contradictions is discovering problems; since our thinking is in contradiction with Marxist-Leninist theory, this shows that there are problems in our thinking that must be solved. If we solve this problem in the course of study, that is, if we clarify our thinking and make it consistent with Marxist-Leninist theory, then it can be regarded as mastering the preliminary method of linking with practice. For example, after studying the history of social development—historical materialism—and knowing the idea that labor creates the world, and knowing that history is first and foremost the history of the working people, and that the people are the driving force for creating history, one must therefore follow the mass line in doing work, and must be good at mobilizing and relying on the masses. Taking this idea as a basis to reflect on one's original thoughts, it will be easy to discover how contradictory one's own thoughts are to this Marxist-Leninist idea. Originally, one held the idea that 'heroes create the times,' regarding history as the history of emperors, kings, generals, and ministers, and not understanding that the working people are the creators of history. Therefore, in actual work, one does not pay attention to the power of the people, is self-righteous, individualistic, and commandist, and this becomes one's main way of working, not understanding that doing work must mobilize and rely on the masses. In this way, the problem that should be solved in our thinking is discovered. For example, studying the history of social development—historical materialism—and knowing the idea of class struggle, and knowing that in class society everyone is engaged in struggle with other classes from a certain class standpoint, and knowing that one must analyze classes when deciding policies in work. Comparing this idea with one's original thoughts, one will surely find many contradictions. Originally, one's own thoughts did not have a clear concept of class struggle, or one thought that some people could have a supra-class standpoint, or one believed that there was no class opposition in Chinese society at all, only the distinction between 'big poor' and 'small poor,' or in work one did not know how to divide classes, did not know how to adopt different policies toward different classes, and many deviations and errors in work arose from this. In this way, due to the study of the history of social development—historical materialism—and after some self-reflection, one will discover that one's own thinking has many contradictions with the basic viewpoints of Marxism, which means discovering some problems that must be solved. We must discover and solve these kinds of ideological problems in studying Marxism-Leninism."

The article said: "Using the basic viewpoints of Marxism-Leninism to oppose one's original non-Marxist-Leninist viewpoints and solve one's own ideological problems is the preliminary method of linking the study of Marxism-Leninism with practice. This means that the first step in studying Marxism-Leninism is to transform one's thinking." And transforming one's thinking "must go through ideological struggle," which means: "Criticism and self-criticism are the driving force for progress in study."

　　艾思奇论学习马列主义的初步方法
    在平出版的“学习”月刊创刊号中，发表了艾思奇的论文“从头学起”，论学习马列主义的初步方法。在这篇论文中，艾思奇根据最近各地，特别是解放不久的各大城市中的学习运动的经验，提出了一些总结性的意见。他指出，目前对于马列主义的学习“还应该是一个从头学起的时期”。他说：“目前许多地方的学习运动所采取的步骤，正是符合于这种情况的。例如一般都是以社会发展史——历史唯物主义作为第一步学习的主要内容。在短短的一个月到三个月里，集中力量对这一门课程作比较深入的研究，不求读太多的书本，不一定要听很多的讲授报告，不急于马上获得马列主义的理论、政策的一切方面的知识，只求经过社会发展史——历史唯物主义的学习中，较有系统地建立起几个马克思主义的基本观点：一、劳动创造世界的思想；二、阶级斗争的思想；三、马克思主义的国家学说。掌握了这些基本的观点，许多不了解和想不通的问题就往往能够自己迎刃而解。由此前进一步，不论是参加工作，或继续更深入的学习，都有很大的便利。经验证明：这种集中力量、少而求精的学习步骤，对于从头学起的人是有很大效果的。而那种排列许多复杂课程，每天接连不断地听讲演报告，把讨论消化的时间挤得几乎没有了的学习步骤，则是效果非常微小的。”
    关于在初步学习中怎样才能做到理论和实际相联系，艾思奇在论文中说：“学习联系实际，第一步最方便的办法，就是联系自己的思想，就是应用所学到的马列主义理论来解决自己的思想问题。在学习理论的时候，应该不断地对自己的思想、工作加以反省，并把自己的思想，拿来和自己所学到的理论加以比较，这样就会发现自己的各种思想与马列主义常常是不同的，甚至完全矛盾的。发现矛盾，就是发现问题；我们的思想既然与马列主义的理论有了矛盾，这就说明我们的思想里有了必须解决的问题。如果我们在学习当中解决了这个问题，就是说，把我们的思想搞通了，使之与马列主义的理论一致，那就算是掌握了联系实际的初步方法。举例来说，学习了社会发展史——历史唯物主义，知道了劳动创造世界的思想，知道历史首先是劳动者的历史，而人民是创造历史的动力，因此在做工作的时候就必须走群众路线，必须善于发动群众，依靠群众。把这个思想作为基础，来反省一下自己的原来的思想，一定容易发见，自己的思想与这马列主义的思想是如何矛盾。原来自己所有的，是‘英雄造时势’的思想，把历史看做帝王将相的历史，而不懂得劳动人民才是历史的创造者，因此在实际工作中，对人民群众的力量就不重视，自以为是、个人英雄主义、命令主义，成为自己主要工作方式，不懂得做工作必须发动群众，依靠群众。这样，就发现了我们思想上应解决的问题。又例如，学习社会发展史——历史唯物论，知道了阶级斗争的思想，知道阶级社会里任何人都在一定的阶级立场上与其他的阶级进行斗争，知道在工作中决定政策必须分析阶级。把这思想和自己原来的思想比较一下，一定又会发现很多矛盾，原来自己的思想，并没有明确的阶级斗争观念，或者以为某些人还可以有超阶级的立场，或者相信在中国社会根本说不上阶级对立，只有‘大贫’‘小贫’的分别，或者在工作中不懂得如何划分阶级，不懂得对不同的阶级采取不同的政策，而工作中的许多偏差和错误就由此产生。这样，由于学习社会发展史——历史唯物主义，经过一些自己反省，就会发现自己的思想与马克思主义的基本观点有着许多矛盾，也就是发现了一些必须解决的问题。我们学习马列主义，就必须发现和解决这一类的思想问题。”
    论文说：“用马列主义的基本观点，来反对自己原有的非马列主义的观点，解决自己的思想问题，这就是学习马列主义联系实际的初步方法。这也就是说，学习马列主义的第一步是要改造思想。”而改造思想又“必须经过思想斗争”，这就是说：“批评与自我批评是学习前进的动力。”
