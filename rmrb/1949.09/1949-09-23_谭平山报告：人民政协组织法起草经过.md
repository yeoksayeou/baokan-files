Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 22nd: Tan Pingshan, representing the Preparatory Committee's Second Group, reported on the drafting process and main content of the "Organic Law of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference" at the second day of the plenary session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. Tan Pingshan said: The Second Group consisted of twenty-one members and held four meetings. The first meeting was convened on June 18th, and five people were designated to draft a discussion outline. The second meeting discussed the basic principles of the new CPPCC organization and its nature, powers, and relationship with the government, and designated Tan Pingshan, Zhou Xinmin, Ye Shengtao, Jiang Guangnai (represented by Qin Yuanbang), Shen Zijiu, Shi Liang, Guo Chuntao, Lin Zuhan, and Yi Lirong to form the drafting committee. After the initial draft was completed, opinions were solicited from various parties, and it was revised repeatedly. On August 18th, it was submitted to the third group meeting for collation, and then submitted to the fourth meeting of the Standing Committee of the New CPPCC Preparatory Committee for approval. The group then convened a fourth meeting to further collate it and submitted it to the second meeting of the Preparatory Committee, which approved it in principle. This is the draft now submitted to the CPPCC plenary session.

Tan Pingshan then explained some of the main issues in the draft:

First, the New Political Consultative Conference was renamed the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference to conform to the actual situation of the conference.

Second, regarding the provisions of the General Principles: In Article 1 of the Organic Law of the CPPCC, the position of the CPPCC is clearly defined. It is to "implement New Democracy, oppose imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism"; its task is to "establish and consolidate an independent, democratic, peaceful, unified, and prosperous People's Republic of China under the people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance." To accomplish this task, it is necessary to unite all democratic classes and nationalities through the unity of various democratic parties and people's organizations domestically, and to unite with nations and countries in the world that treat us as equals internationally. Only in this way can we ensure that our task can be completed.

Third, regarding the provisions for participating units and representatives: Today's CPPCC is an organization of the people's democratic united front, and its scope is naturally very broad. It has both the organizational strength of the four-class alliance led by the working class and the representatives of some patriotic democratic figures, which is very beneficial to the consolidation and expansion of the people's democratic united front. Who should negotiate the number of participating units and the selection of representatives to the CPPCC? In the draft Organic Law of the CPPCC, we stipulate that the first CPPCC "shall be negotiated by the Preparatory Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference," and subsequent CPPCC sessions "shall be negotiated by the National Committee of the previous People's Political Consultative Conference." Regarding compliance with CPPCC resolutions, the draft stipulates that the democratic principle of the minority submitting to the majority shall be adopted. However, it also stipulates that if participants have dissenting opinions, they may still reserve them for discussion at the next session, and those who fundamentally disagree with important resolutions have the freedom to apply to withdraw from the CPPCC.

On the other hand, the draft stipulates that those who violate the Organic Law of the CPPCC, the Common Program, or important resolutions may be subject to sanctions by the National Committee, depending on the severity of the circumstances. Those who are sanctioned may still appeal to the next plenary session if they are not satisfied. This represents the discipline and democratic spirit of the People's Political Consultative Conference.

Fourth, regarding the provisions for the plenary session: The draft stipulates that the CPPCC plenary session shall be held once every three years, but the National Committee may convene the meeting earlier or postpone it if it deems it necessary. The extent of the plenary session's powers varies depending on whether the National People's Congress has been convened. The draft stipulates that before the National People's Congress is convened, it shall exercise the functions and powers of the National People's Congress, including not only the power to legislate (formulate or amend the Organic Law of the Central People's Government) and the right to elect (elect the Central People's Government Committee), but also the right to propose resolutions; after the National People's Congress is convened, it will only have the right to make suggestions.

Fifth, regarding the provisions for the National Committee: The draft stipulates that after the CPPCC closes, the National Committee elected by the CPPCC plenary session shall guarantee the implementation of the resolutions of the plenary session and the National Committee, provide opinions to the government at any time, practically assist the government, guarantee the cooperation of various parties in the government, expand the local united front work, make it easier to convene the next plenary session, and strengthen the unity within the CPPCC.

Sixth, regarding the provisions for local committees: The draft stipulates that before the People's Congress is convened, there should be a National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference under the Central Government; there must also be local committees of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in central cities, important regions, and provincial capitals. However, because the situation varies from place to place, the organizational regulations should be formulated or approved by the National Committee in order to adapt to the actual situation.

　　谭平山报告：人民政协组织法起草经过
    【新华社北平二十二日电】中国人民政治协商会议全体会议第二日，谭平山代表筹备会第二小组报告“中国人民政治协商会议组织法”起草经过和主要内容。谭平山说：第二小组由二十一人组成，曾经开会四次。第一次会议于六月十八日召集，推定五人起草讨论提纲。第二次会议研讨新政协组织的基本原则及其性质、职权、与政府的关系等，推定谭平山、周新民、叶圣陶、蒋光鼐（秦元邦代）、沈兹九、史良、郭春涛、林祖涵、易礼容等九人组织起草委员会。初稿完成后，经多方征询意见，一再修改，于八月十八日提交第三次小组会议整理后，即提交新政协筹委会常委会第四次会议通过。该小组复召开第四次会议再加整理，送交常委会提交筹备会第二次会议在原则上通过。这就是现在提交政协全体会议的草案。
    谭平山接着对该草案若干主要问题加以说明：
    第一、新政治协商会议改名中国人民政治协商会议，是为了符合会议的实际。
    第二、关于总则的规定：在政协组织法第一条，明显地规定政协的立场。是“实行新民主主义，反对帝国主义、封建主义及官僚资本主义”；它的任务，是“建立及巩固由工人阶级领导的，以工农联盟为基础的，人民民主专政的，独立、民主、和平、统一及富强的中华人民共和国”。要完成这个任务，对内必须经过各民主党派、人民团体的团结，去团结全国各民主阶级、各民族共同努力，对外必须联合世界上以平等待我之民族及国家共同奋斗，这样才能保证我们的任务能够完成。
    第三、关于参加的单位和代表的规定：今日的政协，既是人民民主统一战线的组织，它的范围当然很广。既有以工人阶级为领导的四个阶级联盟的组织力量，又能有若干爱国民主分子的代表人物在内，这对于人民民主统一战线的巩固和扩大是很有利的。参加政协的单位名额及代表人选，究应由谁来商定呢？我们在政协组织法草案中规定：第一届政协“由中国人民政协筹备会商定之”，以后各届政协则“由前一届人民政协全国委员会商定之”。关于政协决议的遵守草案规定采少数服从多数的民主原则。但又规定，参加者如有不同意见，仍得保留至下届会议提出讨论，其对于重要决议根本不同意的，并有声请退出政协的自由。
    另一方面，草案规定对违反政协组织法、共同纲领或重要决议者，得视其情节严重的程度，由全国委员会分别予以处分。被处分者如有不服，仍得向下届全体会议提出申诉。这是人民政协的纪律性和民主精神。
    第四、关于全体会议的规定：草案规定政协全体会议每三年开会一次，但全国委员会认为有必要时，得提前或延期召集会议。全体会议职权的大小，则因全国人民代表大会已否召开而有不同。草案规定在全国人民代表大会召开以前，执行全国人民代表大会的职权，不仅有立法权（制定或修改中央人民政府组织法）和选举权（选举中央人民政府委员会），并有提出决议权；在全国人民代表大会召开以后，则仅有建议权了。
    第五、关于全国委员会的规定：草案规定政协闭幕后，即由政协全体会议所选出的全国委员会，来保证实现全体会议及全国委员会的决议，随时向政府提出意见，从实际上帮助政府，保证各党派在政权中的合作，展开地方的统一战线工作，使下届全体会议易于召集，使政协内部的团结加强。
    第六、关于地方委员会的规定：草案规定人民代表大会未召开以前，在中央颁有中国人民政协全国委员会；在中心城市、重要地区和省会，亦须有中国人民政协地方委员会。惟以各地情形不同，故其组织条例应由全国委员会制定或核准，方能适应实际。
