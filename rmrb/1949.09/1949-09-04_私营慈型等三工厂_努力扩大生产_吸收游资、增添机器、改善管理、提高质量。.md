  　Attracting Idle Capital, Adding Machinery, Improving Management, and Enhancing Quality.
    [This City News] Private Fuchang and Dahua factories are currently attracting idle capital to expand production. The Fuchang Weaving and Dyeing Factory originally had only twenty manual looms. Because manual machines had low output and high costs, making it difficult to develop, they recently absorbed a batch of capital, combined with the factory's increased funds, totaling the value of eleven bales of yarn. They added twelve Toyota-style power looms and one winding machine. These machines have all been purchased and are about to be installed and put into operation. Currently, the factory produces about 140 bolts of plain white cloth per month. After the power looms are put into operation, the output can be increased four to five times. Dahua Pottery Company recently absorbed idle capital and increased new shares totaling 70 million yuan, of which more than 40 million yuan has been received. In addition to using part of the new funds to repay debts from losses last year, the remainder will be used to build finished product warehouses, offices, kiln shelters, and install three pulverizers.
    [This City News] The private Cixing Iron Factory has improved its management methods, and workers are actively producing. Recently, they have made progress in increasing output and improving product quality. In the past two or three months, the factory has manufactured a large number of machines and parts for the Ministry of Railways, Dahua Pottery Company, Oriental Paper Mill, North China Water Conservancy Promotion Association, North China Cement Company, Gongting Reservoir, People's Paper Mill, Xinhua Rubber Factory, and others. The workers have high morale, and most of the orders have been completed, with the remainder to be completed in the short term. In terms of improving product quality, the factory customized 200 iron pipes for supplying water to trains for the Pingjin Railway Bureau, guaranteeing no pinholes and no leaks under 250 pounds of water pressure. The results all met the specifications. The 300 waterwheels manufactured for the North China Water Conservancy Promotion Association are very strong and efficient. The factory is gradually improving its management methods. In June, a factory affairs meeting was established as the foundation for establishing a factory management committee. The meeting is held weekly, with the deputy managers, technicians, worker representatives, and heads of various production departments attending to discuss all important issues within the factory. The factory's accounts are also prepared to be made public within the month. Regarding the wage system, piecework is being implemented as much as possible for large jobs. For example, the wages for the 700 sets of hanging bucket screws made for the cement company are based on piecework. In addition, the factory has implemented a bonus system since August 1st, with democratic evaluations every half month, divided into three grades and nine levels based on technology, output, work attitude, and labor discipline, with graded awards given. In addition to adding more than 20 temporary workers since the middle of last month, there are plans to produce machinery for wool spinning, cotton spinning, oil pressing, and flour milling.

　　私营慈型等三工厂
  　努力扩大生产
  　吸收游资、增添机器、改善管理、提高质量。
    【本市讯】私营福昌、大华两工厂最近正进行吸收游资，扩大生产。福昌织染厂原来只有人力织布机二十架，因人力机产量小，成本高，不易发展，最近吸收一批资金，连厂方增加的资金，共折纱十一包，添制了十二台丰田式电力织布机和一台轮线机，这些机器都已购到，即将按装开动。现在该厂每月产大白布一百四十匹左右，开动电力机后，产量可增加四、五倍。大华窑业公司近吸收游资增加新股共七千万元，已收到四千余万元。新资金除一部分偿还去年赔累的债款外，其余则作为修建成品仓库、公事房、锦窑和按装三架粉碎机之用。
    【本市讯】私营慈型铁工厂改进经营方法，工人积极生产，最近在增加产量和提高产品质量方面都有了进步。两三个月以来，该厂给铁道部、大华窑业公司、东方造纸厂、华北水利推进社、华北水泥公司、宫厅水库、人民造纸厂、新华橡胶厂等承制了大批机器及零件，工人生产情绪很高，大部已制造完成，其余短期内亦即可完成。在提高产品质量方面，该厂给平津铁路局定制火车上水用的铁管二百根，保证没沙眼，压二百五十磅水绝不渗水，结果都合乎规定；给华北水利推进社承制的三百辆水车，很坚固，效率亦高。厂方在经营方法上逐渐改进，六月间成立厂务会议，作为建立工厂管理委员会的基础，会议每周举行一次，正副经理、技师、工人代表、各部门生产负责人都出席，讨论厂内一切重要问题，该厂帐目也准备在月内公开。工资制度方面，近来也尽可能把大活实行计件制，如现在给水泥公司做的七百套吊斗螺丝，工资就按照计件制。此外，该厂并自八月一日起实行奖励金制度，每半月民主评定一次，依技术、产量、劳动态度、劳动纪律分为三等九级，分级给奖。对扩大生产，除自上月中旬又增加了二十几个临时工外，并计划着生产毛纺、棉纺、榨油、制面粉等机器。
