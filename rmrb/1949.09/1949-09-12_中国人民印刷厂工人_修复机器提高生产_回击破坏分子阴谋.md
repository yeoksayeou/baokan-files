　　[This Municipality News] After the China People's Printing Factory discovered saboteur An Qingyu damaging machinery, a reporter conducted an on-site investigation and witnessed the entire factory's workers responding to the sabotage attempts with an active production competition and care for the factory. On the morning of the 9th, workers arrived at the factory ahead of schedule. In terms of production volume, among the six people in the West Intaglio Printing Group led by Long Tao, the highest individual output increased by more than 50%, and the lowest also increased by 25%, with an average increase of more than 32%. The production volume of the Finishing Paper Group increased by an average of 50%. The offset printing group increased by 25%. According to the workers, the intaglio printing machine damaged by An Qingyu was recently transported from Changchun. This type of machine is extremely valuable (China cannot yet manufacture it itself). Fortunately, it was discovered early, preventing the saboteur from causing widespread damage. Although the ink rollers were slashed and the gear racks were cut off, the workers of the West Intaglio Printing Group quickly repaired the machine and continued working to increase production in response to the saboteur's destructive actions.

　　The factory workers were extremely indignant at the fact that saboteur An Qingyu repeatedly attempted to sabotage production and damage the factory, demanding that he be severely punished according to the law. Many workers expressed: to protect their own factory and the wealth of the country, they must first unite themselves and assist the government in continuing to expose counter-revolutionary saboteurs, so that no bad elements escape the net. The factory's Party, government, labor union, and Youth League convened a meeting of all workers in the factory on the 10th, held in four different locations. The general secretary, factory director, deputy factory director, and chairman of the staff and workers preparatory committee spoke separately, explaining An Qingyu's crime of damaging machinery, and demanding that workers recognize the class enemy, raise vigilance, cherish machinery, save raw materials, and help the government expose bad people, not allowing a single bad element to remain in the factory. After the meeting, workers everywhere discussed An Qingyu's sabotage of the machinery, unanimously believing that in the future they should monitor the bad elements at all times and in all places, raise vigilance, and strictly prevent sabotage.

　　中国人民印刷厂工人
　  修复机器提高生产
　  回击破坏分子阴谋
    【本市讯】中国人民印刷厂发现破坏分子安庆余破坏机器后，记者到实地调查，目睹全厂工人正以积极的生产竞赛和爱护工厂来回答破坏分子的罪恶行动。九日晨工人均提前到厂，生产量方面，西凹印股领机关龙涛等六人中，个人最高量提高了百分之五十以上，最低也在百分之二十五，平均增高了百分之三十二以上；完成股划纸工生产量平均提高了百分之五十；胶印股提高了百分之二十五。据工友们说，安庆余所破坏的凹印机，是刚自长春运来的，这种机器，极为宝贵（中国目前还不能自造），幸亏发现较早，未容破坏分子大肆破坏。虽然墨油滚子被砍伤，齿轮架被砍断，但西凹印股工人为了回答破坏分子的破坏行动，很快便将机器修理好，继续工作，提高生产。
    该厂工人对破坏分子安庆余屡次企图破坏生产、破坏工厂的事实，极为愤慨，要求依法严办。许多工友表示：要保护自己的工厂和国家的财富，首先必须自己团结起来，协助政府继续检举反革命的破坏分子，使坏蛋一个也不漏网。该厂党、政、工、团于十日召集全体工友在厂中分四处开会。由总支书、厂长、副厂长、职工筹备会主任分别讲话，说明安庆余破坏机器的罪行，要求工友们今后认清阶级敌人，提高警惕，爱护机器，节省原料，并帮助政府检举坏人，不容许一个坏分子在厂内留身。会后工友们到处谈论着安余庆破坏机器的事，一致认为：今后要随时随地监视坏蛋们，提高警惕，严防破坏。
