[Chahar News] To closely connect with the masses, after the takeover work was largely completed in Datong City, the Military Control Commission and the Municipal Government planned and established the All Circles Representative Conference on June 9th. Three meetings have been held, and over a hundred proposals have been put forward. Many valuable opinions have been put forward on issues such as production and construction, burden reform, preventing sabotage and theft, and popularizing cultural education.

The Municipal People's Government has studied the opinions put forward by the representatives. Except for individual opinions that were temporarily postponed due to limited conditions, most of the opinions have been implemented successively. For example, the most urgent issue to be resolved was the problem of unemployed workers. The government has, based on specific conditions, successively resumed work at the match factory, fur factory, and shoe factory, and assisted private egg-beating factories and several flour mills in resuming production, providing preliminary arrangements for the livelihoods of nearly 300 workers. More than 300 remaining unemployed workers were difficult to re-employ due to limited conditions, and the government helped them transition to other occupations.

In terms of wage adjustments: Based on the current conditions, the government first eliminated the illegal exploitation left over by the enemy and made appropriate adjustments. For example, coal carriers generally earn about 15 kilograms of rice per day (some can earn more than 30 kilograms). Some workers said, "In the past, we got 10 kilograms of rice a day, but only 30% was actually received, while now we can get 70% (the other 30% is consumption), which is much better than before." Regarding the issue of waste in mines, the suggestions of the representatives were also accepted, and the relevant departments conducted inspections and made specific improvement plans.

Social security issues: The government has effectively managed loafers, opium addicts, etc., and forced them to participate in labor. Currently, more than 400 people have joined the labor team (coal carrying). Individuals who continue to engage in sabotage have been arrested, which has greatly stabilized social order in the city.

Burden issues: After specific investigation and understanding, the unreasonable methods of the past enemy were reformed, and new and reasonable burdens were implemented.

Regarding the popularization of national education, based on specific conditions, it was decided to add 23 classes to primary schools, which has now begun. This will allow most out-of-school children to enter school to study. Other tasks such as urban sanitation and road repairs have also begun.

Because the issues of urgent concern to all circles have been resolved in a timely and appropriate manner to the extent possible, the government's words and actions are consistent, which has been warmly supported by the people of all circles.

　　大同市人民政府
  　正确执行各界代表会建议得到各阶层人民热烈拥护
    【察哈尔讯】为密切联系群众，大同市于接管工作大致告一段落后，经军管会、市政府的筹划，各界代表会已于六月九日正式成立，并已开过三次会议。提出议案百余条。对生产建设、负担改造、制止破坏偷盗、普及文化教育等问题，均提出了许多宝贵意见。
    该市人民政府对代表们所提意见，均进行了研究，除个别意见因条件所限暂缓执行外，大部意见均已先后执行。如最迫切需要解决的是失业工人问题，政府已根据具体条件，将火柴厂、皮毛厂、鞋厂先后复工，帮助私营打蛋厂及几家面粉厂恢复生产，使将近三百工人的生活得到初步安置。其余三百多名失业工人因条件所限尚难复工，政府帮助转为其他职业。
    在调整工资方面：根据目前条件，首先肃清了敌人残留下的非法剥削，并予以适当调整。如背煤工人一般每日能得米十五斤左右（多者能得三十斤以上）。有的工人说：“过去一天得米十斤，只能实得三成，而现在即能得七成（那三成是消耗），可比以前强多了”。关于矿厂浪费问题，也接受了代表的建议，各有关部门作了检查，并做出具体的改进计划。
    社会治安问题：政府对二流子、烟鬼等已予以有效管理，强迫他们参加劳动。现参加劳动大队的（背煤）已有四百多人。对个别继续为非作歹的破坏分子，已予拘捕。使市内社会秩序大为安定。
    负担问题：经过具体调查了解，改造了过去敌人不合理的办法，实行了新的合理负担。
    对普及国民教育，根据具体条件，决定小学校增加二十三班，现已开始进行，可使大部失学儿童得以入校学习。其他如市内卫生、修理马路等工作均已着手进行。
    由于各界迫切要求的问题，在尽可能的条件下已予以及时的适当解决，政府的言论和行动一致，得到了各界人民的热烈拥护。
