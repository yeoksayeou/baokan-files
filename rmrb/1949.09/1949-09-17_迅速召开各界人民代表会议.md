Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 16th.
In Chairman Mao Zedong's speech at the People's Representative Conference of All Circles in Beiping on August 13th, he said: It is hoped that all cities across the country can quickly convene similar conferences to strengthen the connection between the government and the people, assist the government in various construction tasks, overcome difficulties, and thereby prepare conditions for convening a people's congress with universal suffrage. Chairman Mao also said: Once conditions are ripe, the current form of people's representative conferences of all circles can exercise the functions of the people's congress, become the highest authority in the city, and elect the municipal government. Chairman Mao's call has been warmly echoed throughout the country, and now cities such as Nanjing, Tianjin, Hangzhou, and Wuhan have already convened or are in the process of convening representative conferences of all circles.

Facts have proven that the people's representative conference of all circles is the best organizational form for the people's government to connect with the broad masses of people in a city after liberation during the period of military control. This organizational form is much better than a provisional council; it can connect with the masses more widely and effectively, and wash away the bureaucratic legacy of the old regime's institutions, giving the people's regime a new look among the masses. Establishing a provisional council easily evokes unfavorable impressions reminiscent of the councils convened during the Kuomintang rule; and because it is an advisory body, and its composition often cannot achieve broad representation, it is impossible to establish close ties with the masses. It can also connect with the masses more regularly and broadly than symposiums of all circles and industries, because it can regularly convene representative conferences to communicate the relationship between the government and the people through representatives of all circles. Although symposiums of all circles and industries are a good way to disseminate the policies and decrees of the Party and the government and solicit opinions from all parties when the city is first liberated, they are only temporary in nature, lack a fixed organization, and cannot solve the problem of regular contact with the masses. Through the people's representative conference of all circles, through the activities of representatives of all circles inside and outside the meeting, the opinions of people from all strata can be concentrated, so that the people's government can more clearly understand all aspects of social life and the problems that currently exist, and more accurately formulate policies and important measures; at the same time, the government's governance situation and policies and decrees can be transmitted to the people of all strata, gain the support of the masses, become the action program of the people themselves, and attract the broad masses of people to actively participate in the city's various construction tasks. On the other hand, through the people's representative conference of all circles, through the discussions and work of representatives of all circles, people from all strata can have the opportunity to fully state and communicate their different propositions, requirements, and opinions based on their own interests, especially major issues such as public-private relations, labor-capital relations, and tenant-landlord relations, which involve the lives of the broad masses of people and are most prone to disputes, can seek a unanimous agreement, so that people from all circles can unite more closely under the leadership of the people's government, and the people's government can more comprehensively and properly take care of the interests of people from all strata in future governance. Therefore, in places where the people's representative conference of all circles has been convened and truly successfully held, the efficiency of the people's government has been greatly improved, and the connection between the government and the people has become closer. Beiping is a very good example. After the representative conference of all circles, some people said: In the past, he did not quite believe that the Communist Party would realize democracy; because the democracy he understood was abstract and formal logic. After participating in the representative conference of all circles, he realized the meaning of the democratic system, how democracy and dictatorship are combined, and why the people's democratic dictatorship is necessary.

However, to this day, some party and government leading organs in some cities still lack sufficient understanding of the nature, significance, and role of the representative conference of all circles. Some people believe that it is not appropriate to convene a representative conference of all circles during the period of military control, otherwise it will hinder the functions of the military control commission and affect the rapid establishment of social order. They do not know that even during the period of military control, the representative conference of all circles should still be convened. Because during the period of military control, many of our staff members are transferred from other places, and they temporarily lack contact with the local masses, and their understanding and reflection of the situation is inevitably distanced from reality, while the representative conference of all circles enlists representatives from all circles of the local people to participate, which can become a link between the military control commission, the people's government, and the local people. The convening of the representative conference of all circles will not hinder the functions of the military control commission, on the contrary, it will only enhance the effectiveness of the government's work. Because the purpose of implementing military control is to smoothly take over agencies and enterprises, establish revolutionary order, mobilize and organize the people's forces, eliminate the remaining enemies, suppress counter-revolutionary activities, and restore production; and the representative conference of all circles can unite the people, assist the people's government, and promote the realization of the above-mentioned goals. The functions of the representative conference of all circles are entrusted by the military control commission and the people's government. It is an organ for the people to participate in the construction of political power during the transitional period. When conditions are ripe, it can be entrusted with the functions of the people's congress, in order to transition to the people's congress with universal suffrage. Therefore, as long as we lead well, there will be no conflict with the military control system.

So, how can we make the representative conference of all circles a success? According to the existing experience in various places, at least the following three points should be noted: First, there must be sufficient preparation before the meeting. The number of people participating in the representative conference of all circles should be determined according to the size of the city and the work situation, but each representative should truly have full representativeness. In terms of the composition of members, on the one hand, attention should be paid to purity and solemnity, and reactionary elements should be prohibited from participating, otherwise it will affect the prestige of the representative conference of all circles among the people; on the other hand, attention should be paid to its breadth and flexibility, and representatives from all factories, schools, agencies, garrison troops, people's organizations, democratic parties, and democratic classes should be absorbed to participate, so that all kinds of different people in the city can have close relations with the people's government through their representatives. The representatives of factories, schools, agencies, and troops should be elected by mass meetings as much as possible if conditions permit, in order to enhance their representativeness. Before the meeting, the military control commission and the people's government must prepare a realistic work report, so that the representatives can understand and discuss the government's work. At the same time, it is necessary to consult with the representatives in advance, solicit the opinions of the masses, and prepare one to several central issues related to the lives of the broad masses of the people in the city and that need to be resolved urgently, such as solving the supply of grain and coal, streamlining and saving, dispersing the surplus population in the city, mediating labor-capital disputes, communicating trade between urban and rural areas, banning speculative profiteering activities, restoring and developing public and private economic undertakings, and restoring and developing cultural and educational undertakings, and submit them to the meeting for discussion, and strive to obtain definite results and make written resolutions for implementation.

Second, the meeting time should not be too long, but democracy must be fully promoted, and representatives from all circles should be absorbed to participate in the various tasks and activities of the meeting, so that everyone can contribute their efforts. The government's work report and important proposals in the meeting should allow the representatives to conduct full discussions, encourage everyone to truly speak freely and exhaustively, so that the voices and demands of the people can be reflected, and the government's governance measures can be understood by the representatives. The people's government should humbly listen to the opinions of the representatives, understand the lives and demands of the people, and express acceptance of all well-intentioned and correct suggestions. However, the establishment of any resolution should be very solemn and should not be done hastily. In the discussion, we should guide everyone to study the actual situation of the city, understand the focus of governance, and distinguish the priorities, so that we can make practical and feasible different handling methods for various proposals: those that are necessary and possible should be done, those that are necessary but cannot be done at present should be postponed, and those that are unnecessary and impossible should not be done.

Third, in order to make the representative conference of all circles get definite results, it is very important to implement the spirit and resolutions of the meeting after the meeting. After the closing of the meeting, the representatives should be mobilized to fully use newspapers, radio stations, and mass gatherings to convey and report to all factories, schools, groups, agencies, to the units and masses they represent, and to mobilize the people to discuss the government's work report and the important resolutions in the meeting, so that the resolutions of the meeting are truly understood and accepted by the masses and become the actions of the masses. That is to say, the activities of representatives of all circles should be extended from the meeting to the masses, turning a representative meeting into countless large and small meetings, and making the resolutions of the representative meeting become the resolutions of the broad masses. In this way, the representatives of all circles can truly fulfill their representative responsibilities, the representative conference of all circles can play the role of connecting with the masses, and the connection between the people's government, the representative conference of all circles, and the broad masses will become closer.

The people's representative conference of all circles should not only be convened in cities with a population of more than 30,000, but also in counties in the newly liberated areas, a county-wide people's representative conference of all circles should be convened as an organ for the people's government to have close contact with the people from all walks of life, and its importance is the same as that of the people's representative conference of all circles in the city. Districts and townships convene peasant representative conferences, but revolutionary intellectuals should be absorbed to participate. In the old liberated areas, where conditions are ripe, the people's congress with universal suffrage should be convened; where conditions are not yet ripe, the people's representative conference of all circles can also be convened as a transition. In short, whether it is a transitional people's representative conference of all circles or a people's congress with universal suffrage, it must be convened. Convening is correct, and not convening is not allowed.

### 迅速召开各界人民代表会议

　　迅速召开各界人民代表会议
    中国共产党毛泽东主席八月十三日在北平各界人民代表会议上的讲话中说：希望全国各城市都能迅速召集同样的会议，加强政府与人民的联系，协助政府进行各项建设工作，克服困难，并从而为召集普选的人民代表大会准备条件。毛主席又说：一俟条件成熟，现在方式的各界人民代表会议即可执行人民代表大会的职权，成为全市的最高权力机关，选举市政府。毛主席的这个号召，得到了全国各地的热烈响应，现在南京、天津、杭州、武汉等城市都已经或正在纷纷召开各界代表会议。
    事实证明，各界人民代表会议，是一个城市解放后，在实行军事管制的时期，人民政府联系广大群众的最好的组织形式。这种组织形式，要比临时参议会好得多，它可更广泛而有效地联系群众，并洗涤旧的政权机构的官僚主义的遗毒，使人民政权在群众中而貌一新。而成立临时参议会，则很容易使人联想起国民党统治时代召开过的参议会而发生不良印象；并且因为它是一个咨议机关，而在组成的成份上又往往不容易做到有广大的代表性，因而也就不可能与群众建立密切的联系。它又要比各界、各业的座谈会能更经常而宽广地联系群众，因为它可经常地定期召开代表会议，通过各界代表沟通政府与人民的关系。而各界、各业的座谈会，虽然是城市刚刚解放时传布党和政府的政策法令并征询各方意见的良好方式，但它只是临时性质，缺乏固定的组织，不能解决与群众的经常的联系问题。经过各界代表会议，通过各界代表在会内会外的活动，可以把各阶层人民的意见集中起来，使人民政府能够更清楚地了解社会生活的各方面以及目前存在着的问题，更准确地规定施政方针和重要措施；同时，又可以把政府的施政情况和政策法令传达到各阶层人民中去，取得群众的拥护，成为人民群众自己的行动纲领，吸引广大人民来积极地参加城市的各项建设工作。另一方面，经过各界代表会议，通过各界代表的讨论和工作，又可使各阶层人民由其本身利益出发的不同主张、要求和意见，得到充分的申述和沟通的机会，特别是诸如公私关系、劳资关系、房客和房主关系等这些涉及广大人民生活而又最易发生纠纷的重大问题，可以谋取一致的协议，使各界人民能在人民政府领导下更亲密地团结起来，而人民政府在今后施政方面也能更全面而妥善地照顾各阶层人民的利益。所以，凡是召开了各界人民代表会议并且真正开得成功的地方，人民政府的施政效率都有很大提高，政府和人民之间的联系也更加密切了。北平便是一个很好的榜样，在各界代表会议以后，有些人说：他过去对于共产党要实现民主，是不大相信的；因为他所了解的民主是抽象的、形式逻辑的。而在参加过各界代表会议以后，才领会了民主制度的意义，领会民主和专政是怎样结合起来的，领会人民民主专政是何以成为必要的。
    可是，直到今天，有些城市的党政领导机关对于各界代表会议的性质、意义和作用，还缺乏足够的认识。有些人认为军事管制时期不宜召开各界代表会议，否则便会妨碍军管会的职权，影响社会秩序的迅速建立。他们不知道虽然是在军管时期，还是应当召开各界代表会议。因为在军事管制时期，我们的工作人员有很多是由外地调来的，他们暂时还与当地群众缺乏联系，了解与反映情况难免和实际有距离，而各界代表会议网罗当地各界人民代表参加，正可成为军管会、人民政府与当地人民联系的纽带。各界代表会议的召开，不但不会妨碍军管会的职权，相反地，只会增强政府的工作效能。因为实施军事管制的目的，是在于顺利地接管机关企业，建立革命秩序，发动和组织人民力量，肃清残余敌人，镇压反革命活动和恢复生产事业；而各界代表会议则正是能够团结人民，协助人民政府，促进上述目的的实现。各界代表会议的职权是由军管会和人民政府赋与的，它是过渡时期人民参与政权建设的机关，到了条件成熟时并可赋与执行人民代表大会的职权，以便过渡到普选的全权人民代表大会。因此，只要我们领导得好，是不会与军管制度发生任何冲突的。
    那么，怎样才能把各界代表会议开好呢？根据各地已有经验，至少应该注意如下三点：第一，是开会以前必须有充分的准备。参加各界代表会议的人数，应当视城市大小和工作情况决定，但每个代表应该真正具有充分的代表性。在组成的成员方面，一方面应注意纯洁性和严肃性，禁止反动分子参加，否则便会影响人民群众对各界代表会议的威信；另方面又应注意其广泛性和灵活性，应该吸收各工厂、各学校、各机关、卫戍部队、各人民团体、各民主党派、各民主阶层的代表参加，以便市内各种不同的人民群众都能经过他们的代表与人民政府发生密切的关系。工厂、学校、机关、部队的代表，如果条件具备，应尽可能经由群众大会推选，以增强其代表性。在会议以前，军管会和人民政府必须准备合乎实际情况的工作报告，以便与会代表了解和讨论政府的工作。同时必须事先与代表们协商，征求群众的意见，准备一个至数个与本市广大人民生活有关而有迫待解决的中心问题，例如解决粮煤供应、精简节约、疏散城市多余人口、调处劳资争议、沟通城乡贸易、取缔投机奸商活动、恢复和发展公私经济事业、恢复和发展文化教育事业等，提交会议讨论，并务期得到确实结果，作出成文决议，以便贯彻实施。
    第二，会议时间不要太长，但必须充分发扬民主，吸收各界代表参加会议中的各项工作和活动，使大家都能贡献力量。政府的工作报告和会中的重要提案，应该允许代表们进行充分的讨论，启发大家真正做到知无不言、言无不尽，使人民群众的呼声和要求能够得到反映，而政府的施政措施也能得到代表们的了解。人民政府应该虚心倾听代表的意见，了解人民的生活和要求，对于一切善意的和正确的建议都应表示接受。但成立任何决议应十分郑重，不要草率从事。在讨论中，就应引导大家研究本市实际情况，了解施政重心，分别轻重绥急，以便对于各种议案作出切实可行的不同处理办法：凡必要的而又可能办到的即应该办，凡必要的但目前还办不到的即应缓办，凡不必要而又不可能办到的则不应办。
    第三，要使各界代表会议得到确实的效果，在会后贯彻会议的精神和决议，便是十分重要的事。在会议闭幕以后，应该发动代表们充分利用报纸、广播电台和群众集会场合，向各工厂、学校、团体、机关，向他们所代表的单位和群众，进行传达和报告，并发动人民群众讨论政府的工作报告和会中的重要决议，使会议的决议真正为群众所了解和接受，成为群众的行动。这就是说，要使各界代表的活动由会议中推广到群众中去，把一个代表会议化成无数的大会、小会，使代表会议的决议成为广大群众自己的决议。这样，各界代表才真正尽到代表的职责，各界代表会议才能起到联系群众的作用，人民政府和各界代表会议与广大群众间的联系才会密切起来。
    各界人民代表会议，不但在三万人口以上的城市一律应当召开，在新解放区的县也应一律召开全县性的各界人民代表会议，以为人民政府与各界人民群众发生密切联系的机关，其重要性，和城市的各界人民代表会议是一样的。区与乡则召开农民代表会议，但应吸收革命知识分子参加。老解放区，凡属条件成熟的地区，则应召开普选的全权的人民代表大会；凡属条件尚未成熟的地区，亦可召开各界人民代表会议以为过渡。总之，不论是过渡性的各界人民代表会议，或是全权的普选的人民代表大会，必须召开。召开是正确的，不召开是不许可的。
