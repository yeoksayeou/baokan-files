Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd: People's organizations in Nanjing have issued statements refuting the White Paper of the US State Department. The preparatory committee of the Nanjing General Labor Union stated: After Japan's surrender, US imperialism provided large amounts of money, arms, and materials to aid the Kuomintang bandit gang in fighting the civil war. At the same time, Marshall orchestrated various fake peace tricks in Nanjing. We Nanjing workers saw this very clearly. In the future, our working class must further strengthen its unity with the peasants, petty bourgeoisie, and national bourgeoisie, and resolutely oppose US imperialism and its running dogs. We must strengthen the friendship between the two great peace-loving and democratic fraternal countries of China and the Soviet Union, intensify efforts to conserve and increase production, overcome difficulties, and fight to complete the anti-blockade task. The preparatory committee of the Nanjing Student Union stated: In the future, we Nanjing students will respond to the aggressors' conspiracies with more resolute actions. We must support the front lines, practice thrift and production, and go to the countryside to work. All difficulties in victory can be overcome. US imperialism! Continue your reckless actions! Ultimate failure awaits you! The statement from the Nanjing Municipal Working Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League said: The youth of Nanjing are responding to the White Paper of US imperialism with concrete actions. Disregarding the bombing and strafing by the US-Chiang planes, we participated in the movement to repair dikes and build dams to prevent floods; we participated in the movement to comfort the People's Liberation Army and support the front lines. A large number of young students are assisting the People's Government in conducting industrial, commercial, and rural economic surveys to prepare for the construction of a new Nanjing. The youth of Nanjing are responding to the call for production and thrift, growing their own vegetables and digging their own wells to reduce the burden on the people. The preparatory committee of the Nanjing Municipal Democratic Women's Federation stated: We women not only suffered various insults from the American aggressors ourselves, but also because US imperialism aided the Kuomintang reactionaries in fighting the civil war, sacrificing our husbands, fathers, and brothers. This blood debt has made us deeply aware that the responsibility of women today is to unite all peace-loving and democratic women compatriots in China, work hard, and intensify production to cooperate with the front lines, rapidly liberate all of China, and quickly drive out the imperialist aggressor forces.

　　Distinguish Between Friend and Foe, Eliminate Illusions, and Resolutely Oppose International Reactionaries

Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng, 3rd: People's organizations in Henan and professors from Henan University have expressed their opinions on the White Paper. The preparatory committee of the Henan Provincial Federation of Trade Unions issued a written statement calling on the working class brothers in Henan to unite, respond to the decision of the National Trade Union Work Conference, basically organize the working class of Henan within a year or so, intensify production, practice thrift, and unite with the people of the whole province to build a new Henan, so as to cooperate with the people of the whole country to smash the aggressive conspiracies of US imperialism. The preparatory committee of the Henan Provincial Democratic Women's Federation issued a written statement saying: The 15 million women in Henan must, under the leadership of the Communist Party, thoroughly eliminate the special agents and bandits directly and indirectly supported by the US and Chiang within the province. The preparatory committee of the Henan Provincial Democratic Youth Federation and the Henan Provincial Working Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League jointly issued a statement calling on the youth of Henan to be more vigilant, distinguish between friend and foe, eliminate any illusions about US imperialism, and resolutely oppose the international reactionaries headed by US imperialism. Zhang Baiyuan, Ji Wenfu, and 106 others from Henan University issued a written statement saying: From the contradictory statements in the White Paper, a truth is also reflected, that is, the Chinese Communist Party represents the interests of the Chinese people, and the Chinese people follow the Chinese Communist Party. If anyone wants to oppose the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people, his path will surely be the dead end taken by Wang Jingwei and Chiang Kai-shek. Tian Lesan, vice chairman of the preparatory committee of the Zhengzhou Municipal Chamber of Commerce, said: Only the Soviet Union is the true friend of the Chinese people, and we must learn from the Soviet Union. We should work harder to develop industry and commerce and smash the "blockade" conspiracy of US imperialism and the Kuomintang bandit gang.

　　南京、河南各人民团体
  　驳斥美帝白皮书
  　美帝国主义！你们蛮干到底吧，最后的失败在等待着你们！
    【新华社南京三日电】南京各人民团体发表声明驳斥美国务院白皮书。南京市总工会筹委会声明说：日本投降后，美帝国主义把大量金钱、军火、物资援助国民党匪帮打内战，同时马歇尔在南京策动种种假和平的把戏，我们南京工人是看得清清楚楚的。今后我们工人阶级要更进一步的加强和农民、小资产阶级、民族资产阶级的团结，坚决反对美帝国主义及其走狗。我们要加强中苏两大爱好和平民主的兄弟之邦的友谊，加紧进行节约增产，克服困难，为完成反封锁任务而斗争。南京市学联筹委会声明说：今后我们南京学生将用更坚决的行动来答复侵略者的阴谋。我们要支援前线，要厉行节约生产，要下乡去工作。一切胜利中的困难是可以克服的。美帝国主义！你们蛮干到底吧！最后的失败在等待着你们！中国新民主主义青年团南京市工作委员会的声明说：南京的青年们是以具体的行动来答复美帝国主义的白皮书，我们不顾美蒋飞机的轰炸与扫射，参加了修堤筑坝防止水灾的运动；参加了慰劳解放军支援前线运动，大批的青年学生正协助着人民政府进行工商经济调查，农村经济调查，为建设新南京作准备。南京的青年们，响应生产节约，他们自己种菜，自己掘井，以求减轻人民的负担。南京市民主妇联筹委会声明说：我们妇女，不单单自己本身遭受了美国侵略者种种侮辱，而且还因为美帝国主义援助国民党反动派打了内战，牺牲了我们的丈夫、父亲和兄弟，这一笔血债，已使我们深深地认识到妇女们今天的责任是要把全中国爱好和平民主的女同胞们，紧密地团结起来，努力工作，加紧生产，以便配合前线，迅速解放全中国，将帝国主义侵略势力迅速驱逐出去。
    分清敌友消除幻想坚决反对国际反动派
    【新华社开封三日电】河南各人民团体和河南大学教授纷纷发表意见，评论白皮书。河南省总工会筹委会发表书面声明，号召河南工人阶级兄弟们团结起来，响应全国工会工作会议的决定，在一年左右把河南省工人阶级基本上组织起来，加紧生产，厉行节约，和全省人民团结一致，建设新的河南，以配合全国人民粉碎美帝国主义的侵略阴谋。河南省民主妇联筹委会发表书面声明说：河南一千五百万妇女一定要在共产党领导下，彻底肃清境内为美蒋直接间接扶植的特务、土匪。河南省民主青联筹委会、中国新民主主义青年团河南省工作委员会联合发表声明，号召河南青年更加警惕起来，分清敌友，消除对美帝国主义的任何幻想，坚决反对以美帝国主义为首的国际反动派。河南大学张柏园、嵇文甫等一百零八人发表书面谈话说：从白皮书等矛盾百出的辞句中，也反映了一条真理，即中国共产党代表中国人民的利益，中国人民跟着中国共产党走。如果谁要跟中国共产党与中国人民作对，他的道路一定是汪精卫与蒋介石所走过的一条死路。郑州市商会筹委会副主委田乐三说：只有苏联才是中国人民的真正朋友，要好好地向苏联学习。我们更应努力发展工商业，粉碎美帝国主义和国民党匪帮的“封锁”阴谋。
