　　Welcoming the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference
　　Beiping Presents a New Look
　　Major Improvements in Transportation, City Appearance, and Fire Prevention
　　[Report from Our Newspaper] Hearing that representatives from all over the country attending the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference are arriving in Beiping one after another, and that the Central People's Government, which truly represents the will of all Chinese people, will be formally established through this conference, the joy of the people of Beiping, who have suffered under the oppression and bullying of autocratic governments for so many years, is hard to describe. This joy has immediately permeated all aspects of activity. Everyone's slogan is to establish a model transportation order and city appearance in the people's capital, and to safeguard the security of the people's capital, especially the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. To do these tasks well, the firefighters have specifically and meticulously investigated water sources, formulated fire prevention work plans, reorganized fire police and fire trucks, and carefully inspected the water trucks, machines, clothing, and other equipment used for firefighting. They busily and cheerfully carried out water source inspections for general households, while persuading each household to universally prepare for fire prevention. The members of the Cleaning Brigade, with the slogan of "Do a good job in cleaning and make Beiping more beautiful," sweep the streets an hour earlier every morning, and have specially made fifty new rubber-wheeled garbage trucks to ensure that garbage is promptly removed. Each public security sub-bureau is fully engaged in a concentrated campaign to rectify traffic. The traffic team of the Second Sub-bureau has been working nineteen hours a day for the past few days, and everyone's morale has been high. Their goal is to establish a model transportation order in their jurisdiction. The traffic police of the First Sub-bureau have voluntarily suspended their half-month rest, persevering in their work with amazing endurance, and publicizing traffic rules on the streets with gongs and drums every afternoon. Loudspeakers newly installed at Dongsi Pailou and Bamiantao are broadcasting traffic regulations loudly. All kinds of vehicles are orderly and smoothly following the directions of the traffic police, and the vendors are full of praise. One vendor said, "I have lived for more than forty years and have never seen such responsible and patient police." To further improve transportation construction, more than two thousand students have volunteered to participate in the investigation of traffic volume on various important streets.
　　In front of the magnificent Tiananmen Gate, a square with an area of ​​16,000 square meters, capable of accommodating 160,000 people, has been opened up. More than four thousand male and female students and teachers, children, more than seven hundred cadres of the North China People's Government, and more than three hundred postal workers completed this project through a Saturday shock voluntary labor. To make the square more glorious, large and small lanterns have been newly hung. The students enthusiastically sang: "We shoveled away bricks and stones, paved the great square, transformed Tiananmen, changed and changed."
　　On this square, more than one hundred workers from the Second Engineering Team of the Municipal Government Construction Bureau are driving road rollers to complete the final construction work. They were originally scheduled to work eight hours a day, but for the past few days, they have automatically worked ten hours. They said: "The students are here to build, and our workers must work even harder. When it is repaired, we will listen to Chairman Mao speak to us on Tiananmen Square." They are preparing to remove the four flowerbeds and two traffic command umbrellas, convert them into asphalt pavement, and erect a 22-meter-high flagpole.
　　Inside Zhongnanhai, three roads, from Xinhua Gate along the left coast to Fengze Garden, from Fuyou Street Yunliao Gate to Huai Ren Tang, and from Wenjin Street Fuhua Gate to Ju Ren Tang, were originally uneven cobblestone roads; after the enthusiastic repairs by the employees of the Second and Third Engineering Teams, they have now become smooth and tidy asphalt roads. The entire project covers more than 9,800 square meters. During the Kuomintang era, it would have required more than 6,300 workdays, but this time it was completed with only 2,963 workdays. In order to modify the high-voltage wires and transformers in Zhongnanhai, the workers of the Beiping branch of the North China Electric Power Company worked overtime on Sunday, bringing dry food and not going home for lunch, and launched competitions between groups to complete the work ahead of schedule.
　　The great history of the people is about to open a new page, and the two million people of Beiping are looking forward to the birth of their own central government of the Chinese people.

　　迎接中国人民政协
  　北平气象一新
  　交通市容消防大加整理
    【本报讯】听到各地出席中国人民政治协商会议的代表纷纷抵平，中国人民政协即将揭幕，真正代表全中国人民意志的中央人民政府将经过此次会议而正式产生的消息时，多少年来受尽专制政府压制与欺侮的北平人民，其欢欣是很难形容的。这种欢欣并立即渗入到各方面的活动中去。大家的口号，一是要在人民的首都建立模范的交通秩序与市容，一是要维护人民首都特别是中国人民政协的安全。为了做好这些工作，消防队员们特意详密地调查了水源，订出消防工作计划，重新布置了消防警察和消防车辆，并细心地把消防所用的水车、机器和衣服等用具都一一作了检查。他们忙碌而愉快地对一般住户同样实行水源检查，同时劝说各户普遍作消防准备。清洁总队的队员们以“做好清洁工作，使北平更漂亮一些”为口号，每天清早都提前一个钟头扫街，并特地新制了五十辆皮轮垃圾车，保证垃圾及时清除拉走。各公安分局全力展开整理交通的突击运动。二分局的交通队，近数日来每天工作达到十九个小时，而且大家的情绪一直很饱满，他们的目标是争取在辖区内建立模范的交通秩序。一分局的交通警则自动停止半个月的休息，以惊人的忍耐力坚持工作，并在每天下午打着锣鼓在街上宣传交通守则。东四牌楼和八面槽等处，增设的扩音器在嘹亮地播送着交通规则。各种车辆秩序井然地依着交通警的指挥鱼贯而行，摊贩们交口称赞。有一个摊贩说：“我活了四十多岁，没见过这么负责又这么耐心的警察。”为使交通建设更进一步，有两千多名学生自动参加了各重要街道交通量的调查工作。
    雄伟的天安门前，已开辟了面积一万六千平方公尺、能容十六万人的广场。四千多男女学生和教员、儿童、七百多华北人民政府的干部、三百多邮政人员，曾以礼拜六的突击义务劳动来完成此项工程。为使广场更加光耀，新悬了大大小小的灯头。学生们起劲地歌唱着：“铲除了砖头石块，铺平了伟大广场，改造得天安门，变呀变了样。”
    在这个广场上，市府建设局第二工程队的一百多个工人，驾驶着压路机，正在完成着最后的修建工作。他们原定一天工作八个小时，但是几天以来，他们都自动地做到十个小时。他们说：“学生们都来建设啦，咱们工人更要加劲干。修整好了，听毛主席到天安门上来给咱们讲话。”他们准备把四个花圃和两个交通指挥伞都拆掉，改建成沥青路面，并竖立一个二十二公尺高的旗杆。
    中南海内，由新华门沿左海岸至丰泽园、由府右街运料门至怀仁堂、由文津街福华门至居仁堂等三条路，原先是高低不平的碎石路；经过工程队二、三分队员工的热烈赶修，现已变成光滑整洁的沥青路。全部工程九千八百余平方公尺，在国民党时代须用六千三百多工，这次只用二千九百六十三工就完成了。为了改装中南海的高压电线和变压器，华北电业公司北平分公司的工人星期天加班赶工，中午带着干粮不回家吃饭，小组间展开竞赛来提前完成了工作。
    伟大的人民的历史即揭开新的一页，北平二百万人民在翘首期待着中华人民自己的中央政府的诞生。
