　　Hearing the Victorious Opening of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference
　　People of Tianjin and Beijing Cheer
    Determined to Unite and Strive for the Construction of a New China
　　[Reported by this newspaper] The victorious opening of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference has brought boundless joy to the people of all circles in Beijing. Everyone unanimously and warmly supports the convening of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and wishes it a complete success.
　　More than 20 telecom workers from the Seventh Telecom Bureau squeezed around a radio, listening quietly to the news of the opening of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. Especially after hearing Chairman Mao's report, the workers jumped up with joy. A female worker, Cui Yungang, said excitedly: "The People's Republic of China is about to be born, and we must produce more actively!" Another female worker, Zhu Weixian, said: "In the past, the Political Consultative Conference was convened by reactionaries, but now it is convened by our own people, which is different from the past." They all agreed that the establishment of the Central People's Government and the unification of the country is the result of the Chinese people's struggle. We should be more united, work harder, and build a bright and splendid People's Republic of China.
　　Workers from the Third Telecom Bureau gathered in the cafeteria, the switchboard room, and the workers' dormitory to listen to the news of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. They immediately held a small discussion. Worker Fei Yinkai said, "We have been looking forward to this day, and it has finally arrived. With our own central government, we have a backer!" Worker Yin Zhonglu said, "Everyone should be more vigilant and guard against sabotage by reactionaries..."
　　Private factories in various districts of Beijing were all listening to the broadcast from Xinhua Broadcasting Station if they had radios. More than 30 workers from the First Night School of the First District Federation of Trade Unions applauded and cheered when they heard Chairman Mao's speech. The workers said: "The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference has opened, and the Central People's Government will soon appear. This is a new era, and we must abolish all unequal treaties." Zhang Tingwen, a worker representative from Huaxing Factory, said: "We workers are particularly happy every time we hear about the liberation of a place. Today, hearing about the opening of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, we must step up our studies and production." The workers from Dahua Pottery Company said: "The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference represents the people of all democratic classes. We workers must unite with other democratic classes to build a new China well." Some said: "After the founding of New China, we will no longer be bullied by imperialism, and we will truly be independent and autonomous from now on." The workers unanimously hoped that the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference would successfully complete its tasks, that the whole country would be completely liberated soon, and that everyone would have a good life.
　　Under the Wise Leadership of Chairman Mao, National Economic Construction Will Surely Succeed
　　Yesterday evening (the 21st), cadres from various district government offices in Beijing also listened attentively to the Xinhua Broadcasting Station's broadcast about the opening of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference with extremely pleasant feelings. More than 50 people gathered on the upper floor of the Ninth District Office alone. Although the electricity was cut off for a while due to rain, everyone waited quietly. When they heard Chairman Mao speaking passionately, the comrades jumped up excitedly. Hearing the applause from the venue, everyone couldn't help but applaud as well.
　　After listening to the broadcast, the comrades discussed animatedly. Cadres from the Eighth and Third Districts unanimously said that this meeting fully demonstrated the unprecedented great unity of the people of all strata. A cadre from the Ninth District said: "In the past, when the revolution was difficult, we fought underground warfare, but at that time, we had a firm belief: We must win! Sure enough, today, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, this wish has been achieved." He is even more convinced that under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, the national economic construction will surely succeed in the end. Zhuang Wei of the Third District Committee said: "From now on, the Chinese nation will no longer be an insulted nation, we have stood up." Everyone unanimously believed that the soon-to-be-established Central People's Government would certainly be able to lead the people of the whole country to victory.
　　When the broadcaster first announced that the news of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference would be broadcast tonight, it set off a wave of excitement and joy among the students of Normal University. The faculty and students of the Second Institute, who lived on campus, gathered under the loudspeakers in the rain, listening quietly to every word. When Chairman Mao spoke, everyone smiled knowingly at each other, and thunderous applause rang out, unable to contain their excitement. Everyone said, "The voice of the people's leader is even louder today." After listening to Chairman Mao's speech, the professors said excitedly: "The convening of the People's Political Consultative Conference signifies the success of the united front and the correct policies of the Chinese Communist Party and the wise leadership of Chairman Mao!"
　　The news of the convening of the People's Political Consultative Conference attracted more than 1,000 professors, students, workers, and police from Tsinghua University. Some professors braved the rain and rushed to the loudspeakers in the auditorium with the students. "Long live the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference!" "Long live the People's Republic of China!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" In the cheers, hearing the speech of the people's leader Chairman Mao, the students said in unison that this is the voice of the 400 million people of China! We want to establish the People's Republic of China! We will never be oppressed by imperialism again. When the past situation of the old Political Consultative Conference convened by the Kuomintang reactionaries was mentioned, student Feng Sixiao said excitedly: "At that time, our classmates in Chongqing also celebrated, but we were beaten at Jiaochangkou. Today is the people's own Political Consultative Conference, and we can cheer and celebrate to our heart's content!" When the students heard Chairman Mao say in his speech that there would still be many difficulties in the future and that they would have to be overcome step by step, everyone's faces looked very serious, showing that they would resolutely complete the task of building the country as instructed by Chairman Mao.
