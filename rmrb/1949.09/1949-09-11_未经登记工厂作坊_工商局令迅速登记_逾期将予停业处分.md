　　Unregistered Factories and Workshops
　  Industry and Commerce Bureau Orders Prompt Registration
　  Overdue Registration Will Result in Shutdown
    [This City News] The city's industrial registration was completed by the Industry and Commerce Bureau in May and June. However, it has recently been discovered that there are still many unregistered factories and workshops, especially those engaged in weaving, dyeing, and knitting. They often request loans from banks or ask the Flower Yarn and Cloth Company and department store branches to exchange finished products for yarn. This not only undermines the government's understanding of the city's industrial production situation and affects plans to support production, but it is also illegal and unreasonable. To this end, the Industry and Commerce Bureau has specially stipulated that from now until September 20th, these factories and workshops that failed to register last time will be given another opportunity to complete registration. In addition to notifying the trade associations of various industries to inform all unregistered businesses, it has also notified the People's Bank and other units that, from September 20th onwards, all private industrial enterprises requesting loans or yarn exchanges must hold a business license issued by the Industry and Commerce Bureau or an approval for operation to be valid. At the same time, any unregistered factories or workshops, once discovered, will be dealt with in accordance with Article 10 of the "Provisional Measures for Industrial and Commercial Enterprises in North China to Apply for Business Registration" as a refusal to register, and will be subject to a shutdown penalty.

　　未经登记工厂作坊
　  工商局令迅速登记
　  逾期将予停业处分
    【本市讯】本市工业登记，早于五、六月份由工商局办理完竣。但近来发现仍有不少未经登记的工厂作坊，特别是经营织染、针织两业的，时向银行请求贷款，或向花纱布公司、百货分公司请求以成品换纱，这不但破坏政府对全市工业生产情况的了解，影响对扶植生产的计划，并且也是不合法、不合理的。工商局为此，特规定自即日起到九月二十日止，再给这些上次未登记的工厂作坊一个补行登记机会，除已通知各业同业公会，转知尚未登记各户外，并通知人民银行等各单位，自九月二十日后，凡私营工业要求贷款、换纱者，均须持有工商局所发营业证或准予开业的批示，才能有效。自同时起，凡未经登记的工厂作坊，一经查获，将依照华北区工商业声请营业登记暂行办法第十条之规定，以拒绝登记论，予以停止营业处分。
