　　A Visit with Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Delegate, Revolutionary Elder He Xiangning
　　Bai Sheng

　　Today, as the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference convenes, among the six hundred-plus people's representatives, the reporter met Madame He Xiangning, the wife of martyr Liao Zhongkai, a revolutionary elder with white hair and temples, aged seventy-one. She is a representative of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang and is attending the People's Political Consultative Conference this time with her son, Liao Chengzhi, and daughter, Liao Mengxing.

　　Today's CPPCC reminded her of China's revolution over the past fifty years. She excitedly recounted many of her experiences participating in the revolution in her Guangdong-accented Mandarin. Madame Liao was originally from Mian Village, Nanhai County, Guangdong. Her father was a businessman in Hong Kong, so she grew up there. At the age of twenty, she married the revolutionary martyr, Mr. Liao Zhongkai. At that time, it was during the Reform Movement of 1898, and people with advanced ideas all wanted to learn from foreign countries. Mr. Liao wanted to study in Japan at this time, so Madame Liao sold her jewelry to support her husband, and the two went to Japan to study one after another. In Tokyo, they met Mr. Sun Yat-sen and were greatly inspired by hearing Mr. Sun talk about the revolution, so they decided to join the revolutionary cause. Several years before the Xinhai Revolution, Madame Liao and Mr. Sun Yat-sen formed the Tongmenghui (Revolutionary Alliance) together in Japan. During the Xinhai Revolution, both she and Mr. Liao returned to China to participate in revolutionary work.

　　In the conversation, she always kept Mr. Sun Yat-sen and Mr. Liao Zhongkai in mind. When talking about Mr. Sun Yat-sen serving as President in Guangzhou in 1922, she said: At that time, Mr. Sun Yat-sen was determined to launch the Northern Expedition because he vigorously implemented revolutionary policies, but the governor of Guangdong, the famous warlord Chen Jiongming at the time, resolutely opposed it and intended to rebel. Although Sun Yat-sen was tolerant and lenient towards him and sent Mr. Liao Zhongkai to persuade him, hoping that he could change his mind, Chen Jiongming finally rebelled, and Mr. Liao Zhongkai was also detained by him. At that time, Sun Yat-sen was grief-stricken and was forced to leave by his aides and take refuge on a warship. Madame Liao, upon receiving the news of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's plight, disregarded all danger and searched for Mr. Sun and Madame Sun overnight. After finding them, she delivered supplies to them until Mr. Sun was safe. Then, she ran around day and night for more than two months for the release of her husband.

　　In January 1925, Madame Liao rushed north from Guangzhou again because Mr. Sun Yat-sen was seriously ill in Beijing and lived in Tieshizi Hutong after arriving in Beiping. At that time, everyone felt uneasy because Mr. Sun Yat-sen was very ill, and they had no choice but to euphemistically ask Mr. Sun about the future. On January 24, Mr. Sun Yat-sen made three wills, one of which was to be forwarded to the Soviet government through the Soviet Ambassador to China, Karakhan, expressing that "China is willing to unite with Russia in brotherly friendship to jointly resist imperialism and complete the world revolution." This was signed the day before Mr. Sun Yat-sen passed away. Speaking of this, Madame Liao said with great emotion that she remembered Mr. Sun Yat-sen repeatedly holding her hand before his death and instructing her about the Chinese revolution, especially emphasizing the need to strengthen the policy of alliance with Russia and the Communist Party. Madame Liao also mentioned that there was a sentence in Mr. Sun Yat-sen's will: "Unite with the nations of the world that treat me equally to fight together." Originally, Mr. Sun Yat-sen meant to write "Unite with all oppressed nations of the world to fight together," but at that time, Duan Qirui, Wang Jingwei, and others were afraid of the power of imperialism and insisted that Mr. Sun Yat-sen change it.

　　In August of the same year, Mr. Liao Zhongkai was assassinated by the Kuomintang reactionaries in Guangzhou. Madame Liao was extremely grief-stricken and determined to dedicate herself to the revolution to the end, following in her husband's footsteps.

　　Subsequently, after Chiang Kai-shek openly betrayed the revolution, the blood of Communists and progressive elements was shed all over China. From this time on, Madame Liao resolutely broke away from the Kuomintang reactionary group led by Chiang Kai-shek and fearlessly and more resolutely engaged in the struggle against the counter-revolutionary forces. The successive sacrifices of her husband and son-in-law at the hands of counter-revolutionaries, and the two imprisonments of her son Chengzhi at the hands of the reactionaries, only deepened her hatred for the reactionaries.

　　But today... When talking about the great victory of the Chinese people's revolution and freedom and liberation, she seemed to breathe a sigh of relief and became excited from her suppression. She said in a loud voice: If there were no Chinese Communist Party, no Chairman Mao's wise and great leadership, and no arduous struggle of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and a resolute long-term and brutal struggle against the reactionaries, how could China have today! I have been waiting for twenty-two years, and today the Chinese revolution has finally been victorious, and the people have raised their heads. Then, she said even more emotionally: I have participated in the revolution with the martyrs for these decades, and today I can personally see the reactionaries being defeated and the revolution winning victory. I am really indescribably happy in my heart!

　　Finally, Madame Liao also mentioned that, according to the experience and lessons of the revolutionary martyrs, it proves that the Chinese Communist Party's current policy of friendship with the Soviet Union is completely correct and necessary. She also quoted a sentence that Mr. Sun Yat-sen said during his lifetime: The Soviet Union is a "friendly teacher." Why is it a "friendly teacher"? Because the Soviet Union can lead all weak nations in the world to fight together and lead the suffering and oppressed people to stand up and seek freedom and liberation. At the same time, Madame Liao emphasized that the new China's construction undertakings are currently lacking in technical talents, and in order to develop production and exploit China's underground resources, it is necessary to rely on the help of the Soviet Union and other new democratic countries. Therefore, she said: It is necessary to make the Chinese people understand the necessity of Sino-Soviet friendship and strengthen their understanding of the Soviet Union. Today, we want to oppose imperialist aggression and build a new China with people's democracy. Without the assistance of the Soviet Union, it is impossible.

　　Regarding this People's Political Consultative Conference, she said she firmly supports it. Especially regarding the draft Common Program of the CPPCC, she said: This is the product of embodying the will of the entire Chinese people, and therefore she completely agrees with it.

　　中国人民政协代表访问记  革命老人何香凝
    柏生
    在人民政协召开的今天，记者在六百多个人民代表中，会到了这位白发鬓斑，年高七十一龄的革命老人，廖仲恺夫人——何香凝先生。她是国民党革命委员会的代表，这次与她的儿子廖承志女儿廖梦醒，一同参加了人民的政协会议。
    由于今天的政协，使她想起了五十年来中国的革命。她兴奋的用带有广东口音的国语和记者讲述了许多当年她参加革命的事情。廖夫人原是广东南海县棉村人，父亲在香港经商，因此她便生长在那里。二十岁时与革命先烈廖仲恺先生结婚。当时正值戊戌政变，思想先进的人们，都想学外国。这时廖先生欲求学日本，廖夫人就变卖自己的珠宝手饰资助丈夫，二人先后东渡日本留学。在东京得识孙中山先生，听中山先生畅谈革命，大为激发，就决心参加革命事业。辛亥革命前数年，廖夫人与中山先生在日本同组同盟会。辛亥革命起义时候，与廖先生都先后回国参加革命工作。
    在谈话中，她总念念不忘孙中山先生和廖仲恺先生。谈到一九二二年中山先生在广州任大总统时，她说：当时中山先生因厉行革命政策，决意北伐，而广东都督，当时著名的军阀陈炯明却坚决反对，蓄意谋叛。虽然孙中山先生对他优容宽大，并派廖仲恺先生劝说；深望他能心回意转，但不久陈炯明终于叛变了，廖仲恺先生也被他扣起来。当时中山先生悲愤之中为左右强扶出走，避于兵舰上。廖夫人得到中山先生蒙难的消息，连夜不顾一切危险寻找孙先生与孙夫人，找到后，并为他们送递东西，直至孙先生获得安全后，她才又日夜为丈夫的被扣奔走达两个多月。
    一九二五年一月，廖夫人因中山先生在北京病重，便又匆匆由广州北上，到平后即住铁狮子胡同。当时大家因为中山先生病得很沉重，人人心里都感到惶惶不安，逼不得已才和中山先生婉言请示后事。一月二十四日，中山先生立了三个遗嘱，其中有一个是给苏联驻华大使加拉罕转苏联政府的，内容是表示“中国愿以兄弟之谊与俄国联合起来共同抵抗帝国主义，完成世界革命。”这是在中山先生临逝前一天签的字。谈到这里，廖夫人很感慨的说，记得中山先生临逝前曾再三的握住她的手为中国的革命而叮嘱，尤其着重在要加强联俄联共的政策上。廖夫人又谈及中山先生遗嘱中有一句“联合世界上以平等待我之民族共同奋斗”，原本中山先生的意思是写“联合世界上一切被压迫之民族共同奋斗”，但当时因段祺瑞、汪精卫等怕帝国主义的势力，一定要中山先生改掉的。
    同年八月，廖仲恺先生在广州被国民党反动派所暗杀。廖夫人万分悲痛，决心踏着丈夫的血迹献身革命到底。
    接着，蒋介石公开背叛革命后，共产党人的血和进步分子的血，洒遍了全中国，廖夫人从这时起，便毅然决然的脱离了以蒋介石为首的国民党反动集团，不畏强暴地，更加坚决地从事与反革命势力的斗争。丈夫、女婿的先后牺牲在反革命分子手里，儿子承志在反动派毒手下的两次坐狱，这些都只有更深深地增加了她对反动派的仇恨。
    但今天，…当谈到目前中国人民革命的伟大胜利，自由与解放的时候，她象是松了一口气，从抑压中兴奋起来，她亮着嗓子说：如果没有中国共产党，没有毛主席的英明伟大的领导，没有中国人民解放军的艰苦奋斗与反动派坚决进行长期残酷的斗争，中国怎能有今天！我盼望二十二年了，今天中国革命终于胜利，人民抬起了头。接着，她更感慨的说：我随着先烈参加革命这几十年，今天能亲眼看到反动派被打垮，革命得到胜利，我心里真是有说不出的高兴！
    最后，廖夫人又谈到，根据先烈革命的经验与教训，证明今天中国共产党的对苏联友好政策是完全正确和必须的。她并引中山先生生前讲的一句话：苏联是“国友人师”。为什么是“国友人师”呢？因为苏联能够领导世界上一切弱小民族共同奋斗并领导被压迫的痛苦人民起来翻身求得自由解放。同时廖夫人更着重的指出目前新中国的建设事业中，技术的人才很缺乏，为了发展生产，开发中国地下的富源，这是一定要得力于苏联及各新民主主义国家的帮助的。因此，她说：一定要使中国的人民了解到中苏友好的必要和加强对苏联的认识。今天，我们要反对帝国主义的侵略，要建设一个人民民主的新中国，没有苏联的援助是不可能的。
    对于这次人民的政协会议，她说她是坚决拥护的。特别对政协的共同纲领草案，她说：这是体现全中国人民意志的产物，因而也完全同意。
