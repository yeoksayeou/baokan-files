Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 31st: Delayed news from Budapest: After visiting the head of the Soviet delegation on the 19th, the Chinese Youth Delegation held receptions at their residence on the 23rd and 25th to host youth representatives from New Democratic countries and capitalist countries.

　　At 3 PM on the 23rd, over 200 youth representatives from Hungary, Poland, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Albania, Romania, Mongolia, and East Germany were invited to attend. These young people, who had gone through arduous struggles and are now advancing towards a beautiful and happy new society, gathered together as if old friends were reunited, or like a family gathering. Han Tianshi, the deputy head of the Chinese delegation, told these young friends in his speech that the Chinese People's Liberation Army has grown into a regular army of four million with modern equipment in the battles. He then introduced the combat heroes and naval representatives from the Chongqing warship uprising among the Chinese representatives. The entire audience stood up and applauded them in salute. Finally, he spoke about the blockade of the new China by the US-Chiang reactionaries, saying: The Chinese people have the leadership of Chairman Mao, the assistance and construction experience of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, and this battle against the enemy's blockade will surely be won. At this point, the guests present stood up again and enthusiastically cheered the names of Stalin, Mao Zedong, and the leaders of various people's democratic countries, which lasted for a long time.

　　In their speeches, the guests from various countries expressed their respect for the Chinese fighting youth and praised the great victory of the Chinese people. When the Chinese delegation presented each representative with a commemorative badge of Chairman Mao, everyone cherished it as a treasure and immediately pinned it on their chests. In the evening, everyone parted in the song of the Internationale, but still reluctantly asked each other for autographs, took photos, and exchanged souvenirs and contact addresses. They also eagerly hoped that the Chinese delegation could visit their countries.

　　At 3 PM on the 25th, about 200 youth representatives from 14 countries including France, Italy, the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Belgium, the Netherlands, Austria, Germany, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Switzerland, and Denmark were invited to attend the reception of the Chinese delegation. Chen Jiakang, the secretary-general of the Chinese delegation, emphasized in his speech that the Chinese people have always firmly opposed imperialism, but they only oppose the imperialist governments of various countries, and never oppose the people of various countries. The enemies of the Chinese people are also the enemies of the working people and peace-loving and democratic people all over the world. When he said that Chinese youth will follow Chairman Mao's teachings, oppose the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries who have turned to the side of imperialism, and also oppose the illusions of the third road, and resolutely turn to the side of socialism, the audience applauded warmly. Representatives from various countries spoke one after another. Representatives from the United States and other capitalist countries unanimously expressed their joy at the victory of the Chinese people's struggle and their hatred for the reactionary policies of their own governments. They all said that they had learned a lot of fighting experience from this youth festival, and the fighting experience of Chinese youth was a very important one. The French representative pointed out that the progressive youth and people of France will never allow Vietnam to become a base for imperialist war. The Italian representative described the facts of the struggle of Italian youth for peace this year and presented a flag they used in demonstrations all over Italy to the Chinese representative. The Canadian representative said: The friendship between the Chinese and Canadian people has a long history, and the deeds of Dr. Bethune are something that the Chinese and Canadian people will never forget. His name symbolizes the permanent friendship and unity between the Chinese and Canadian people. The British representative said that after returning home, they will work hard to make the youth and people of Britain more aware of the new China. The Dutch representative pointed out that the Dutch progressive youth are on the side of the Chinese people and the Indonesian people's guerrillas, not on the side of the Dutch government and the Indonesian traitors. The German representative said that German youth are willing to fight for peace together with youth all over the world. They will fight for the cause of peace and democracy, and thereby gain the trust of youth all over the world. The atmosphere at the meeting was filled with deep friendship of international youth solidarity from beginning to end.

　　These two receptions, together with the previous two receptions (hosting youth representatives from Southeast Asian countries and youth representatives from Free Greece and Spain), have further enhanced the friendship and unity between Chinese youth and youth from various countries.

　　增强国际青年的友谊和团结
  　我青年代表团续招待各国代表
  　战斗青年欢聚一起洋溢着浓厚的国际友情
    【新华社布拉格三十一日电】布达佩斯迟到消息：中国青年代表团在十九日拜访苏联代表团负责人后，又于二十三、二十五两日先后在寓所举行招待会招待新民主主义国家的青年代表和资本主义国家的青年代表。
    二十三日下午三时，匈、波、保、捷、阿、罗和蒙古、东德等青年代表二百余人，应邀到会。这些经过艰苦斗争、现正向着美满幸福的新社会前进的青年们相聚在一起，好象故友重逢，又象是家庭欢聚。中国代表团副团长韩天石同志在讲话中告诉这些青年友人们，中国人民解放军在战斗中已壮大成为有近代化装备的四百万正规军队。他随即介绍了中国代表中的战斗英雄和重庆号起义的海军代表，全场都起立向他们鼓掌致敬。他最后讲到美蒋反动派对新中国的封锁说：中国人民有毛主席的领导，有苏联与人民民主国家的援助和建设经验，这反对敌人封锁的一仗一定是会打赢的。至此，到会来宾又起立热烈欢呼斯大林、毛泽东及各人民民主国家领袖的名字，历久不息。
    各国来宾致词中都表示对中国战斗青年的敬意，并赞扬中国人民的伟大胜利。当中国代表团拿出毛主席的纪念章赠给每个到会代表时，大家如获至宝，立即挂在胸前。傍晚，大家在国际歌声中分手，但仍依恋地互相要求签名，互相拍照、交换纪念品和通讯地址。他们并热望中国代表团能到他们国家去参观。
    二十五日下午三时，法、意、英、美、加、比、荷、奥、德、瑞典、挪、芬、瑞士、丹等十四国青年代表约二百人应邀出席中国代表团的招待会。中国代表团秘书长陈家康致辞时着重指出：中国人民一向是坚决反对帝国主义的，但他们只反对各国帝国主义政府，而决不反对各国人民。中国人民的敌人，也正是全世界劳动人民与爱好和平民主人民的敌人。当他说到中国青年将按照毛主席的教导，反对倒向帝国主义一边的蒋介石反动派，也反对第三条道路的幻想，坚决倒向社会主义一边时，全场热烈鼓掌。各国代表相继致词。美国代表和其他资本主义国家代表一致表示对中国人民斗争胜利的欢欣及对其本国政府反动政策的痛恨。他们都表示从这次青年节中学习了不少的斗争经验，中国青年的斗争经验就是很重要的一个。法国代表指出：法国的进步青年同人民，决不让越南成为帝国主义战争的基地。意大利代表叙述了今年意大利青年为争取和平而斗争的事实，并把他们在意大利各地游行示威用过的一面旗帜赠给中国代表。加拿大代表说：中加人民的友谊是有着悠久历史的，白求恩大夫的事迹，是中加人民永远不能忘记的，他的名字就象征着中加人民永久的友谊和团结。英国代表说：他们回国后将努力从事于使英国的青年和人民更多地了解新中国。荷兰代表指出：荷兰进步青年是站在中国人民和印尼人民游击队的一边，而不是站在荷兰政府与印尼卖国贼的一边。德国代表说：德国青年愿意和全世界青年一起为和平而斗争，他们将为和平民主事业进行斗争，并以此获得全世界青年的信赖。会场上自始至终贯彻着浓厚的国际青年大团结的友情。
    这两次招待会连同上两次招待会（招待东南亚各国青年代表及自由希腊与西班牙青年代表）一起，使中国青年和各国青年的友谊与团结进一步增强了。
