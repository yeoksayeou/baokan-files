　　Hope Literary and Art Workers
  　Write and Perform More Plays for Workers
    Liu Lan
    On the evening of the 16th, the Northeast Cultural and Educational Work Team performed the worker opera "Earning Merit" for all the employees of the Tangshan Railway.

    This play expresses the enthusiasm of workers in the production movement, who, in order to support the front lines, fear no difficulties, resolutely complete their tasks, and how workers unite, help each other, and promote the spirit of collectivism.

    After watching "Earning Merit," we all agreed that it was a good play, "So satisfying!" We had never seen such a large-scale worker opera.

    As he walked, Fatty Zhou from the locomotive section said very modestly to Little Wang, "From now on, we shouldn't help people like Wang Kui did." Old worker Wang Defu from the electrical section nodded and said, seeing Little Zhang behind him, "Young man, learn from Gao Sheng! Recognize your past mistakes and quickly become active."

    "From now on, just watch me," Little Zhang said to Old Wang with great remorse.

    The next day at work, everyone discussed and agreed that what Gao Sheng said was right: "If Chairman Mao hadn't led us to stand up and become masters, we wouldn't have what we have today." While working, we shouted the slogan: "Learn from labor hero Zhao Haiming, respond to Chairman Mao's call, and be sure to earn merit on the production front!"

    Today, our workers' task is to develop production. We hope that literary and art workers will come to the factory more often to help us and enlighten us. Write more plays that encourage and educate the workers to help us complete this task.

　　Correction

　　希望文艺工作者
  　多给工人编剧演戏
    刘岚    
    十六日晚上，东北文化教育工作队，给我们唐山铁路全体员工演出工人歌剧“立功”。
    这个剧是表现工人在生产运动中的积极性，为了支援前线不怕任何困难，坚决完成了任务，以及工人之间如何团结、互助，发挥集体主义的精神。
    我们看完了“立功”一致认为是个好剧，“太可口味啦！”从来没有看见这样大型的工人歌剧。
    机务段胖子老周一边走一边对小王很虚心的说：“以后咱们不要象王奎那样帮助人了。”电气段老工友王德福点了点头，看见了后边的小张说：“小伙子跟高升学习吧！认识自己过去的错误，快点积极起来”。
    “以后你就瞧着吧。”小张很自悔的对老王说。
    第二天上班的时候，大家都议论着认为高升说的太对啦：“要不叫毛主席领咱们翻身做了主人咱还有今个”。在干着活的时候我们喊出了口号：“向劳动英雄赵海明学习，响应毛主席的号召，一定要在生产战线上立功！”
    今天我们工人的任务是发展生产，希望文艺工作者，多到工厂来帮助我们，启示我们。多编一些对工人有鼓励，有教育的剧，配合我们完成了这个任务。
　　更正
    本月十九日本刊所载“苏联宇宙航空学的创造者康士坦钉齐奥柯夫斯基”一文之作者为“心迈”；第一行中之“（十八日）”应为“（十九日）”；第七行中之“一只手”应为“一双手”。
