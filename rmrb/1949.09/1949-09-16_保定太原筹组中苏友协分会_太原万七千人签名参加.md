　　Baoding and Taiyuan Prepare to Form Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Branches
　  17,000 People in Taiyuan Sign Up to Participate
    [Baoding Electric Dispatch] Various organizations, groups, troops, and patriotic people from all walks of life in Hebei Province and Baoding City are actively initiating preparations to establish the Baoding branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. 209 people have already signed up to participate. The initiators convened a meeting of initiators on the 10th at the Provincial Government. Lin Tie, Secretary of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, stated in his speech that the enthusiastic preparation by various organizations, groups, and people from all walks of life in Hebei Province and Baoding City to establish the Baoding branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association fully demonstrates the friendship between the peoples of the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union. The meeting approved Yang Xiufeng, Lin Tie, Sun Yi, and 36 others as members of the preparatory committee, and elected Yang Xiufeng as the chairman of the preparatory committee.
    [Taiyuan Electric Dispatch] Responsible persons from the Party, government, military, and various organizations and groups in Taiyuan City initiated the establishment of the Taiyuan branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association on the 4th. The initiative first clarified the sympathy and help of the Soviet Union for the cause of the Chinese people's liberation since the October Revolution. It then pointed out that today's New China must stand in the democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union to oppose the aggressive behavior of the imperialist bloc. The initiative particularly emphasized: In order for Shanxi Province to achieve its industrialization goals, the best teacher is the Soviet Union. We must learn from the Soviet Union's construction experience. Therefore, we specifically initiate the establishment of the Taiyuan branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association.
    [Taiyuan Electric Dispatch] The Taiyuan branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association began soliciting signatures on the 5th, and by the 13th, it had reached 17,213 people. This signing demonstrated great mass participation, with more than 500 large and small units from all walks of life, including workers, peasants, soldiers, students, and merchants, participating in the signing. Many factories, schools, and troops participated in the signing as a whole, such as the Independent Sixth Brigade, with 3,638 participants. The signature campaign has now come to an end, and once the preparatory work is completed, an initiators' meeting will be convened to formally establish the preparatory committee.
