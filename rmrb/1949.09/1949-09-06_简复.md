　　Mr. Li Dihua:
    I. Through tickets have long been available for sale at all stations; however, the trains are not yet through, and it is necessary to change trains at connecting stations.
    II. The railway now handles baggage and parcel transport responsibly, and passengers may consign items according to regulations. Restrictions on items that passengers can carry with them are published at all stations.
    III. Regarding the matter of feces all over the floor outside the waiting room of Xuzhou Station, orders have been issued to the department concerned to improve and rectify the situation.
    IV. Regarding the prevention of the unauthorized sale of black market tickets, all stations are strictly enforcing regulations and have promulgated reward measures for reporting black market tickets.
    V. Regarding train delays, stations have long been notified to use loudspeakers to inform passengers at stations equipped with loudspeakers. Stations without loudspeakers should provide verbal announcements or write notices on the waiting room bulletin board.
    VI. According to the Ministry's regulations on passenger transport rules, the maximum weight of items that passengers can bring into passenger cars is 20 kilograms (40 Jin). Regarding the order of ticket checking, ticket checking is now done in advance, but it is not convenient to let passengers in too early to avoid disrupting order inside the station.
    VII. Fresh vegetables and other perishable and easily spoiled items are given priority for transportation.
    VIII. All railway lines are now open and smooth, and passenger and freight transport is extremely frequent. There is often a shortage of vehicles to meet demand, so there are no empty cars available for use.
