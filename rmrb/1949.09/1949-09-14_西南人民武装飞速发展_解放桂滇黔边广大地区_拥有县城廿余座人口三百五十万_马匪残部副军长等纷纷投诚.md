[Xinhua News Agency, Beiping Radio Broadcast] Beiping, 13th Dispatch: Encouraged by the victorious situation of the Liberation War, the people's armed struggle in the Guangxi-Yunnan-Guizhou border area has been rapidly developing. Up to recently, more than 20 county towns have been liberated, vast guerrilla areas have been opened up, and more than 3.5 million people have been liberated. In Guangxi, the people's guerrilla warfare has spread throughout the Zuojiang and Youjiang river basins, including more than 20 counties such as Longzhou, Wancheng, Wuming, Guode, Longshan, Du'an, Jingxi, Zhenbian, Binyang, Yongchun, Hengxian, and Guixian. The development of people's armed forces in Yunnan has been even more rapid. In the year from the first half of last year to the first half of this year, it has increased tenfold, and the scope of people's armed activities has spread throughout the province. According to existing materials, in southern Yunnan, from Yuanjiang, Xinping, Jingdong to south of Zhenkang, all the way to the borders of Burma and Vietnam, vast areas in southern Yunnan, including many county towns, have been liberated; in western Yunnan, eight county towns such as Weixi, Jianchuan, and Dengchuan, as well as vast villages and towns in western, central, and southeastern Yunnan, have been liberated. In the more than 20 county towns that have been liberated, the people's armed forces have established four administrative offices and 18 people's county governments, possessing more than 150 towns of all sizes and a population of 3.5 million. The people in the liberated areas of Guangxi, Yunnan, and Guizhou are now under the leadership of their own government, establishing revolutionary order and steadily moving towards the road of restoring and developing production. Now, the people in the liberated areas and vast guerrilla areas of Guangxi, Yunnan, and Guizhou are urgently mobilizing, preparing to welcome and cooperate with the People's Liberation Army, to advance into the southwest, and to fight for the liberation of the great southwest and the liberation of all of China.

[Xinhua News Agency, Northwest Front, 13th Dispatch] After the People's Liberation Army liberated Xining, the capital of Qinghai Province, the officers and soldiers of the remnants of Ma Bufang's bandit troops who escaped from Lanzhou, feeling that there was no way out for continuing their reactionary activities and unwilling to continue to serve as cannon fodder for the Kuomintang bandit gang, surrendered to the People's Liberation Army one after another. From the 8th to the 11th of this month, within four days, as many as 500 people, including the deputy army commander and division commander of Ma Bufang's bandit remnants, surrendered to our army. On the 8th, Zhao Sui, deputy army commander of the 82nd Army of Ma Bufang's bandit troops, Ma Wending, chief of staff, Tan Chengxiang, division commander of the 100th Division, Ma Yuanqing, chief of staff, Ma Chengjun, commander of the cavalry regiment, Han Youlu, division commander of the 248th Division, Gao Fashen, commander of the cavalry regiment, and Yang Xirong, division commander of the 357th Division, led more than 320 of their remnants to Xining to surrender to the Liberation Army. In the three days from the 9th to the 11th, Ma Zhenwu, division commander of the 190th Division of Ma Bufang's bandit troops, Ma Zixiu, deputy division commander, and Ma Zhiwu, commander of the 568th Regiment, Ma Denglei, commander of the 569th Regiment, and a part of officers and soldiers of the 25th Regiment of the 8th Cavalry Division, totaling 151 people, successively surrendered to the Liberation Army. The Liberation Army seized more than 800 rifles, more than 180 light machine guns, and nearly 200 war horses. According to the surrendered officers and soldiers, since Ma Bufang's bandit remnants escaped from Lanzhou, the fighting spirit of the officers and soldiers has been completely lost, and many have deserted along the way.

[Xinhua News Agency, Northwest Front, 13th Dispatch] A unit of the Shaanxi Southern People's Liberation Army attacked the Shanyang Self-Defense Corps, which was entrenched in Wujiashan, Shanyang County, on August 29th, annihilating and capturing 128 bandits, including Mao Pengfei, the deputy commander of the bandit regiment. Another unit of the Liberation Army launched a surprise attack on the Bai Qingyun bandit troops entrenched in Fenghuangzui, northeast of Zhen'an County, on the 2nd of this month, capturing more than 90 bandits alive.
