Good Books for Children: First Issue of "Chinese Children" Published
	Ya Qun
	China Youth Publishing House, 2 Wangfujing Street, Beijing

For quite some time, people have been saying in the newspapers that there is nothing for children to read, causing many of them to read those weird and strange, feudal and superstitious "little picture books." Now it's great, the first issue of "Chinese Children," published by the China Children's Publishing House, is out!

Look: on the cover, a whole bunch of children dressed in bright red and green are having so much fun; it makes adults happy to see them! But, how can children just play? So, when you open the first page, there are large characters written by Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, telling the children to "study hard," "be healthy, be lively, learn, learn." Because "children are the masters of the future and the builders of the new society," Comrade Feng Wenbin goes on to advise the children: "To become outstanding children of the new China, to become model youths and children, you should love the motherland, love the people, love learning, love labor, and love the collective..."

Have you understood these principles? Then, listen to stories and look at pictures! Lin Wei's "Mantianfei Travels in the Northwest," Zuo Lin's "45,000 Li Travelogue," Xiao Guang's writing and Liu Yi'an's paintings in "Li Xiaowu Delivers Intelligence," Wu Lao's "A Belt"; stories with pictures, pictures with stories, both good-looking and easy to understand; and Mr. Guo Moruo's "The Story of Yellow Fever," Mr. Gao Shiqi's "Exposing the Secrets of Lilliput," can give you some unheard-of scientific principles.

Do you love to read and listen to these? Then children, let's also talk about your own affairs! So Wang Xincheng talks about "Me as a Little Teacher," Li Xiu talks about "Our Study Group," and several children start writing articles together, and want "everyone to write"!

How to write? Mr. Ye Shengtao tells everyone: "Writing is like talking," not difficult at all!

There's still a lot more! I can't say it all, children, go and see for yourselves.

　　小朋友有好书看了 　“中国儿童”第一期出版
    亚群
    北京王府井大街二号中国青年社发行
    好久就有人在报上说，没有小朋友们喜欢读的东西，使得很多小朋友们去读那些怪头怪脑的，封建迷信的“小人书”。现在可好了，中国儿童社办的“中国儿童”第一期出版了。
    你看：封面上一大堆穿得红红绿绿的小朋友们，玩得那末起劲，大人看了也挺开心！可是，小朋友们光是玩怎么行呢？所以，你一翻开第一页，就有毛主席朱总司令亲笔写的大字，叫小朋友们“好好学习”，“要健康，要活泼，要学习，要学习。”因为“少年儿童是未来的主人，是新社会的建设者”，所以，冯文彬同志接着就劝小朋友们：“要使自己成为新中国的优秀儿女，成为模范的少年和儿童，就应当爱祖国，爱人民，爱学习，爱劳动，爱集体……”
    这些道理都已看懂了么？那末，听讲故事，看图画吧？林韦的“满天飞游西北”，左林的“四万五千里旅行记”，萧光写，刘易晏画的“李小五送情报”，吴劳的“一条裤带”，故事里有画，画里有故事，又好看，又好懂；还有郭沫若先生的“黄热病的故事”，高士其先生的“揭穿了小人国的密秘”，更可以给你一些没有听过的科学道理。
    这些你都爱看爱听么？那末小朋友们也自己来讲一讲自己的事情吧！于是王新成讲“我做小先生”，李岫讲“我们的学习小组”，一共好几位小朋友七手八脚地写起文章来，并要“大家都来写”！
    怎样写法呢？叶圣陶先生告诉大家：“写文章跟说话”一样，一点不难！
    还有很多哩！我也说不完，小朋友们自己去看好了。
