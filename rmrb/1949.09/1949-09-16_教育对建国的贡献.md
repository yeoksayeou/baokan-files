　　Education's Contribution to National Construction
    Huang Yanpei
    There are several important issues in education currently. I will first discuss one of them:
    In June of this year, I traveled from Beiping to Shanghai. A fellow engineer on the train said, "We are currently calculating that the country has over 27,000 kilometers of railway. In the next five years, we plan to add several thousand kilometers, including several trunk lines like Lanzhou to Dihua. We have solutions for steel and timber, but we need 40,000 engineering personnel. Currently, the entire country only has 6,000."
    After returning to Beiping, a veteran in the banking industry told me, "The People's Bank, responsible for the nation's financial affairs, estimates that after nationwide liberation, they will extend the People's Bank to all regions, provinces, and counties, requiring approximately 100,000 personnel. Currently, Shanghai's banking staff accounts for more than half of the country, but it's still only 16,000 or 17,000."
    Based on the above calculations, there is a shortage of railway engineering personnel by 85%, and banking personnel by approximately 60% to 70%. These are just examples. However—
    In Shanghai, the visitors and letters I received were mostly about job seeking. It was the same in Beiping. How can I comfort them? Let me give an analogy: Farmland with poorly maintained ditches often suffers from drought, and heavy rain causes severe flooding. Today's supply and demand for people is similar. Normally, unemployment is rampant everywhere, but when a major project is launched, we suffer from a shortage of talent.
    Is there a real shortage? Yes, there is a real shortage. But the problem is not the quantity; it's the quality. What is needed are people who have received specialized training in various fields, while most job seekers have only received general education.
    This phenomenon has been going on for a long time. In the past, the country did not have opportunities for large-scale construction. What about the future? Under the New Democracy, the policy of increasing production and promoting economic prosperity will be realized. When the national electrical grid begins to be laid out, a large number of workers will be needed. When the cotton textile industry expands from the current 4 million spindles to 10 million spindles, a large number of textile engineering personnel will be needed. When improving and promoting certain crops, a large number of agricultural guidance personnel will be needed. These are just a few examples. I fear that when the national production plan is proposed, the Financial and Economic Commission will require the Culture and Education Commission to deliver a certain number of certain specialized talents within a specified period.
    On this point, I want to tell a comical story: In the past, administrative departments were divided into "hot" and "cold" categories. "Hot" departments absolutely looked down upon, did not admire, and did not trust "cold" departments. Transportation, finance, commerce, and economy were "hot" departments. The talent they needed should logically come from the "cold" education departments. Only cooperation between "cold" and "hot" departments could produce suitable talent. But how could "hot" departments condescend to cooperate with "cold" departments! Taking advantage of their fiery momentum, regardless of authority, they snatched the education for training specialized talent and ran it themselves, leaving the Minister of Education dumbfounded and helpless. However, they had to run some agricultural, industrial, and other specialized schools of various levels under their own jurisdiction to save face. The students taught by these schools suffered. The agencies in charge of the "hot" departments would certainly not recruit them in large numbers, and as a result, these young people suffered greatly. Isn't this a big joke in administration!
    This education for training specialized workers in agriculture, industry, etc., was called industrial education at the end of the Qing Dynasty and the beginning of the Republic of China, and later it was called vocational education. Let me tell another story:
    In 1917, I went to Japan and visited Mr. Tejima Seiichi, a senior expert in industrial education and former principal of the Tokyo Higher Industrial School. I was invited to his home for a long conversation. I said that China was planning to establish vocational education. The old principal was very surprised and said, "Japan has been running new education for decades, and until now, we only dare to call this kind of education industrial education. China has jumped to calling it vocational education. You are becoming egalitarian so quickly!" This is recorded in my book "The New Education of Southeast Asia."
    What is the meaning of this sentence? It can be seen that 30 years ago, people only knew about running industrial education to help capitalists accumulate wealth, and did not approve of vocational education to help the common people solve their livelihood problems. But in that year, the sixth year of the Republic of China, the China Vocational Education Society was established, advocating egalitarian vocational education.
    Vocational education, on the one hand, helps the common people solve their livelihood problems, and on the other hand, it is also an important preparation for the country to increase production. The Vocational Education Society clearly stated their goals. However, the Northern Warlords obviously did not see it, and the reactionary Kuomintang government could not say anything at all. It is pitiful that egalitarian vocational education survived for more than 30 years in China under the internal and external layers of oppression by imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism.
    Now, the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China will be produced following the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. Next, there are several things that I deeply hope and firmly believe will be done:
    1.  Formulate a national economic plan for several consecutive years, including agriculture, heavy and light industry, mining, forestry, fishery and animal husbandry, water conservancy, reclamation, railways, highways, shipping, and maritime transportation. It is necessary to execute this with full strength.
    2.  When formulating the aforementioned plan, propose the types and quantities of talent needed for the aforementioned plan, and the deadline for when they are needed. Formulate a national education plan for several consecutive years.
    3.  According to the aforementioned education plan, conduct education and training in both the long and short term, while investigating, registering, and employing all existing talents of various types in the country that are needed for the aforementioned economic plan.
    These things should be done to develop production. Shouldn't they also be done to help solve the livelihood problems of individuals, based on the general principle that material life determines everything? Please look at the Soviet Union:
    "Higher education institutions train the highest qualified specialists. Technical schools train specialists with secondary training in industry, construction, transportation, communications, and agriculture."
    "Before the October Revolution, secondary vocational training was underdeveloped. In 1914, the total number of students in secondary vocational schools was only 35,800. The tremendous development of socialist industry, agriculture, and culture has made the rapid progress of higher and secondary vocational training in the Soviet Union necessary."
    "In 1938, there were a total of 951,900 students in technical schools, secondary medical schools, and other vocational schools, an increase of 26.6 times compared to pre-revolutionary Russia."
    These are words from Medinsky's book "The Soviet Education System."
    Great! Great! Of course, this is the country's demand for education, and it is also education's contribution to national construction.
    I would also like to add a report: The mechanical engineering students who graduated from the Shanghai China Vocational School run by the Vocational Education Society this summer were transferred and employed by the local government, but the quantity was far from sufficient. The number of applicants for engineering courses in various schools this autumn was particularly crowded, almost unprecedented.
    Isn't the shift in national power and the trend of people's hearts clearly demonstrated here!

### 教育对建国的贡献

　　教育对建国的贡献
    黄炎培
    当前教育上有几个重要问题，我先说这中间的一个：
    今年六月我从北平到上海，同车一位工程师说：“我们正在计算，全国现有铁道二万七千多公里，今后五年里打算添筑几千公里，中间包括几条干道，象兰州到迪化之类，钢铁木材都有办法，就是需要工程人员四万，而现在全国仅有六千。”
    回到北平，一位老于银行业者告我：“负有全国金融总责的人民银行，计算在全国解放以后将人民银行推广到各区、各省、各县，算来约略需要人员十万，而现时上海银行人员几占全国半数以上，但还只一万六七千。”
    依上计算，铁路工程人员缺少到百分之八十五，银行人员大约缺少到百分之六七十，这不过是举例罢了。但是——
    我在上海，来访的客人，收到的信件，绝大多数，是求职。到了北平，还是这样。怎样安慰他们呢？提出一个比喻，沟渠失修的农田，常常闹旱灾，一下大雨，就苦淹水，今天人的供求，也是这样，平时到处闹失业，但某一大工作举办时，将又苦人才不够用了。
    真不够用么？真不够用。可是不是数量不够，问题是在品质上边。所需要的是受过各种专科训练的人员，而呼号求职者大都属于仅受过普通教育者。
    这种现象，闹了好久好久了，过去国家没有举办大规模建设的机会。今后呢？在新民主主义下增加生产、繁荣经济政策是要实现的了，到了全国电气网着手布置时，就大量需要工作人员；棉纺织业由现时纱锭四百万枚，想扩充到一千万枚时，就大量需要纺织工程人员；要改良推广某种农作物时，又大量需要农事指导人员。这也不过举几个例，怕全国生产总计划提出时，财经委员会将要求文教委员会限期交出多少多少某种某种专门人才来。
    在这上边，我说一桩滑稽性的故事，过去的行政衙门，分冷热两种，热衙门对冷衙门绝对看不上眼，绝对不佩服，不信任。交通、财政、工商、经济等是热衙门，他们所需要的人才，照理要从教育冷衙门管辖下产生，总得冷热两种衙门合作，才能产生出适当的人才来，热衙门那里肯屈尊和冷衙门合作呢！趁着火一般势焰，不顾权限，把训练专门人才的教育，抢过来自己办，弄得教育部长白瞪了两眼，一点没有办法，但自己管辖下也得办些农工等各级专门性学校撑撑场面呢。这些学校教出来的学生苦了，热衙门主管的机关当然不会大量录用的，结果这班青年吃了大亏，这不是行政上的大笑话么！
    这些训练农工等专门工作人员的教育，在清末，在民国初年称为实业教育，后来被称为职业教育。我再来说一桩故事：
    一九一七年我去日本，在东京高等工业学校里，访问工业教育前辈专家手岛精一老校长，被约到他家里长谈。我说，中国正在计划办职业教育，老校长很惊讶地说：“日本办新教育几十年，到现在，对这种教育，只敢称实业教育，中国一跃而称职业教育，你们平民化得这样快！”这事记在我所写的“东南洋之新教育”一书里。
    这句话包含的是什么意义呢？可以看出三十年前一般人只知举办帮资本家累积财产的实业教育，而还不赞成帮平民解决生计问题的职业教育。但是中国就在那年民国六年成立了中华职业教育社，大倡平民化的职业教育了。
    职业教育，一方面帮助平民解决生计问题，一方面也是国家增加生产的重要准备工作，职教社就这样明白地揭出他们的目标。可是过去北洋军阀，当然见不到，反动的国民党政府，更是一切说不上。可怜平民化的职业教育，在中国在帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义内外层层压迫之下，就这样苟延生命了三十多年。
    现在，中华人民共和国中央人民政府将跟着中国人民的政治协商会议而产生了，接上来有几件事，我深切地期望同时也坚决地相信一定这样办的：
    一、制定全国连续若干年经济总计划，中间包括农业、重轻工业、矿山、森林、渔牧、水利、垦殖、铁道、公路、航运、海运一切生产运输事业，是要全力来执行的。
    二、在制定前项计划时，提出前项计划所需要人才的种类、数量和开始需要期限。制定连续若干年的全国教育总计划。
    三、根据前项教育总计划，一面长期短期分别教育训练，一面调查前项经济总计划所需要的全国现有各种人才登记录用。
    这些，为了发展生产，该这样办，为了帮助解决个人生计问题，根据物质生活决定一切的大原则，不也应该这样办么？请看苏联：
    “高等学校训练的，是最高资格的专门人才，技术学校训练的，是工业、建筑、运输、交通与农业各部门具有中等训练的专门人才。”
    “十月革命以前，中等职业训练是不发达的，一九一四年中等职业学校的学生总数仅三万五千八百人，社会主义的工业、农业和文化的巨大发达，使苏联的高等和中等职业训练的迅速进展，成为必要。”
    “一九三八年技术学校，中等医科学校及其他职业学校的学生，共有九十五万一千九百人，比革命前的俄国，增加了二十六倍点六。”
    这是梅丁斯基著“苏联教育制度”一书里的话。
    伟大！伟大！当然的，这是国家对教育的要求，也是教育对建国的贡献。
    我还附带报告一句：职教社所办上海中华职业学校今夏毕业的机械科学生，被地方政府调取录用，数量太不够供应了。秋季招生，各校工科报考者特别拥挤，几于空前。
    国势的转移，人心的趋向，在这里表现得还不够明白么！
