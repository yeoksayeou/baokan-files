Land Administration Bureau's Half-Year Work Overview
City Government Press Office

Since its establishment, the Land Administration Bureau of the Beiping Municipal People's Government, in addition to being busy with the initial takeover, has focused its primary work over the past six months on mediating housing lease disputes and registering real estate, issuing property ownership certificates, and other tasks to implement the policy of protecting and managing privately owned urban houses, encouraging housing construction, and developing urban construction in a planned manner. The bureau has also conducted a general survey of land prices in the urban area and a survey of vacant land to clearly delineate land grades and clarify public and private property rights. The bureau's various tasks are now on track and proceeding according to plan.
		
		Investigating Real Estate Disputes
Since the Military Control Commission of this city promulgated the proclamation on housing issues on May 16th, the Land Administration Bureau has dispatched cadres to various districts to investigate the situation of housing and land lease disputes, understand the crux of the disputes, and provide a reference for establishing new mediation institutions and determining mediation procedures. Since the start of mediation work on real estate disputes on June 20th, up to the end of August, the bureau received a total of 696 cases directly applied for by citizens and transferred by district offices. Of these, excluding those that had to be transferred to the People's Court for trial and other agencies for handling, the Land Administration Bureau handled 266 cases, including 111 cases that were successfully mediated, 56 cases that were not successfully mediated, 15 cases that were settled through persuasion and self-agreement, 43 cases that were handled jointly, and 12 cases where mediation was terminated, with 29 cases still pending. The number of real estate disputes settled through mediation is increasing month by month. For example, the Land Administration Bureau mediated 15 cases successfully in June, 26 cases in July, and 70 cases in August.
The 7th district of this city took the lead in adopting the method of classifying and collectively mediating housing disputes, and the results of the trial implementation were good. The Land Administration Bureau specially convened a meeting of cadres from the mediation sections of various districts on August 22nd. After detailed research, it was decided to notify all districts to adopt this method universally and to call on all districts to continuously research and improve it in their work to replace the method of mediating cases one by one. In addition to the 7th district continuing to adopt the method of collective mediation, the 3rd and 9th districts also successively adopted this method, which generally improved the efficiency of mediation work. In total, the 12 districts in the city and suburbs received 2,882 housing dispute cases by the end of August, and a total of 1,644 cases had been successfully mediated, accounting for 70 percent of the total number of cases concluded.
In the disputes that were successfully mediated, the agreed-upon rent was generally still low. For example, in the 841 cases where agreements were reached in various districts, 617 cases had a monthly rent of 15 jin of millet or less, accounting for 73.4 percent; 332 cases had a monthly rent of 10 jin of millet or less, accounting for nearly 40 percent. Calculating the wages of tile workers for repairing houses, the daily wage for a master worker is 12 jin of millet, and the wage for a junior worker is 8 jin of millet. The monthly rent for each room is not even enough to cover the expenses of two master and junior workers. How can this make landlords profitable and maintain and develop urban housing? In the review of mediation work, the bureau emphasized the need to correct this deviation.
		
		Real Estate Registration and Certificate Issuance
Real estate registration is the main method of determining real estate property rights. The Land Administration Bureau began this registration on June 16th. By the end of August, it had cleared 1,586 old cases, newly received 6,280 registrations, reviewed 2,422 cases, surveyed 3,186 cases, announced 4,075 cases that could receive certificates, transferred 5,989 cases to the Public and Enemy Property Clearing and Management Bureau for attention, and drawn 5,177 sectional maps. By the end of August, a total of 962 real estate ownership certificates had been issued, and certificate issuance is continuing.
In handling real estate registration and certificate issuance, the method of owners handling it themselves was implemented. This can prevent theft and property disputes, and it also combats the bad habits of brokers and lawyers who monopolize registration and defraud citizens; it also transforms the old thinking of the working masses who dare not enter "government offices." Since the bureau began handling real estate registration and certificate issuance, it has discovered cases of forged deeds and impersonation. For example, the major broker Zhai Guangting privately forged deeds to deceive owners and was exposed after registration; Niu Zhaoxiang was a usurer who privately engraved the owner's name on 18 house deeds that others had mortgaged, attempting to muddle through registration, and was also found out, and all were denied certificates.
		
		Land Surveying and Other
Land surveying is divided into fieldwork and office work. The Land Administration Bureau started fieldwork on April 1st, carrying out small triangulation surveys, traverse surveys, and household land surveys. On July 5th, the 13th and 20th districts of the old city were completely surveyed, totaling 110,560 mu, completing 63 percent ahead of schedule. Office surveying is the calculation of area and map drawing. The work procedure is edge connection, numbering, preliminary calculation and re-calculation, inspection and distribution, annotation of mu and fen, and map mu and fen, drawing and annotating public maps and checking public maps. By the end of August, a total of 54,275 area calculations had been completed, and 345 public maps had been drawn, accounting for about four-tenths of the original plan. It is estimated that all will be completed by the end of this year.
In order to formulate measures for the temporary management of vacant land in the urban and suburban areas, the Land Administration Bureau sent more than 20 employees to various districts in early July to survey vacant land, which was roughly completed by early August. A total of 10,376 mu of vacant land (not used for construction) were found in the 12 districts, accounting for about 11 percent of the total area of 92,929 mu in the urban and suburban areas. The 10th district (i.e., the outer three districts) has the most vacant land, accounting for about 42 percent of the district's land area; the 8th and 9th districts (outer one and two districts) have the least, accounting for only 2 percent of the district's land area.

　　地政局半年工作概况
    市府新闻处
    北平市人民政府地政局成立以后，除初期忙于接管外，半年来的主要工作，着重于房屋租赁纠纷的调解及房地产登记，颁发房地所有权状等，以执行保护与管理城市私有房屋，鼓励房屋修建，有计划地发展都市建设的政策。该局并进行了城区房地价的普遍调查和空地的勘查，以便明确划分房地等级和划清公私产权。该局各项工作，现已步入正轨，正按计划依次进行中。
    　　　　调查房地纠纷
    自五月十六日本市军管会公布关于房屋问题的布告后，地政局即开始派遣干部分头到各区调查房地租赁纠纷的情况，了解纠纷的症结所在，以为筹设新的调解机构及决定调解程序的参考。自六月二十日开始房地纠纷的调解工作，截至八月底止，由市民直接声请和各区公所转送地政局调解的案件共有六九六件。其中除必须转送人民法院审判及其他机关办理的以外，经地政局处理的有二六六件，计调解成立的一一一件，未成立的五十六件，接受说服自行协议的十五件，并案办理的四十三件，停止调解的十二件，尚有二十九件未办完。经调解而成立协议的房地纠纷，逐月增加。例如：六月份地政局调解成立的案件为十五件，七月份为二十六件，八月份为七十件。
    本市第七区曾首先采用了分别类型、集体调解房屋纠纷的办法，试行结果成绩良好。地政局特于八月二十二日召集各区调解科干部开会，经过详细研究后，决定通知各区普遍采用；并号召各区于工作中不断研究改进，用以代替逐案调解的工作方法。除第七区继续采用集体调解的方法外，第三、九等区也先后采用了这一办法，普遍提高了调解工作的效率。总计本市城厢十二个区到八月底止共收到二、八八二件房屋纠纷案件，已经调解成立的共一、六四四件，占已结案件总数的百分之七十。
    在调解成立的纠纷案件中，房租的议定一般还是偏低。例如在各区成立协议的八四一件案件中，每月租金在十五斤小米以下者计六一七件，占百分之七三·四；在十斤小米以下者计三三二件，占百分之四十弱。以修理房屋的瓦工工资计算，每日大工工资为十二斤小米；小工工资为八斤，每间房屋一个月的租金尚不足两个大小工工资的开支，这如何能使房东有利可图，保养发展城市房屋呢？该局在调解工作的检讨中，曾着重指出要纠正这种偏差。
    　　　　房地产登记及发状
    房地登记是确定房地产产权的主要办法。地政局在六月十六日开始举办这一登记，截至八月底共清理旧案一、五八六件，新收登记的六、二八○件，已经审验的二、四二二件，查丈的三、一八六件，业经公告可以领状的有四、○七五件，转送到公逆产清管局查注意见的有五、九八九件，经绘制分段图的五、一七七件，到八月底共发出房地产所有权状九六二件，仍在继续办理发状中。
    在办理房地登记和发状中，实行了业主亲自办理的办法。如此，既能防止盗卖及产权纠纷的情事，又打击了纤手和律师们包办登记欺诈市民的恶习；并使了劳动群众不敢进“衙门”的旧思想得到转变。该局自办理房地登记、发状以来，已发现有假造契证、冒名顶替的情形。如大纤手翟光庭私造契证，欺骗业主，在登记后被发现黑幕；牛兆祥是个高利贷者，把别人抵押的房契十八件私刻了业主的名章，企图蒙混登记，也被查出，全都不予发状。
    　　　　土地测量及其他
    土地测量，分外业和内业两部。地政局自四月一日起开始外业测量工作，进行小三角测量、导线测量及户地测量等。七月五日把旧市区的十三及二十两区完全测竣，计一一○、五六○亩，提前完成百分之六十三。内业测量，就是求积绘图，工作的程序是接边，编号，初算复算，检查配赋，注记亩分，并图亩分，绘注公布图及核对公布图等。截至八月底共完成求积五四、二七五起，绘注公布图三四五幅，约占原计划十分之四，预计到今年年底可全部完成。
    为拟定城厢区空地代管办法，地政局于七月初先后派员工二十余人到各区勘查空地，至八月初已大致完成。总计十二个区共有空地（未作建筑用者）一○、三七六亩，约占城厢区总面积九二、九二九亩的百分之十一。其中以第十区（即外三区）空地最多，约占该区土地面积百分之四十二；以八、九两区（外一、二区）最小，仅占该区土地面积百分之二。
