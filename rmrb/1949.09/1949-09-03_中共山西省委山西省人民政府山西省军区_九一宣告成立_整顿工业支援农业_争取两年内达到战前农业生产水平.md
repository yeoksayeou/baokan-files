[Taiyuan Electric] The CCP Shanxi Provincial Committee, Shanxi Provincial People's Government, and Shanxi Military Region held a grand inaugural meeting in Taiyuan City on September 1st. Nearly 7,000 people attended, including cadres from provincial and municipal organs, troops, and organizations, responsible persons from special districts and counties, as well as democratic figures and representatives from all walks of life. Chairman Xie Xuegong announced the list of responsible persons for the CCP Shanxi Provincial Committee, Shanxi Provincial People's Government, and Shanxi Military Region to the conference, explaining the significance of the restoration of the Shanxi province system and the task of building a new Shanxi province.

The New Shanxi Construction Guidelines:

Comrade Lai Ruoyu, Deputy Secretary of the CCP Shanxi Provincial Committee, then spoke, humbly explaining that the construction of the new Shanxi is an arduous task, expressing the hope that representatives from all walks of life would offer more opinions, and pointing out the three basic guidelines for building the new Shanxi: (1) production and construction; (2) development of culture and education; (3) doing a good job in maintaining law and order. In order to successfully complete the above tasks, Comrade Lai Ruoyu particularly emphasized the need to strengthen unity, practice strict frugality and economy, strengthen party building and democratic governance, in order to fully promote the spirit of democracy and make the people's power truly built on a solid mass base.

Subsequently, Pei Lisheng, Vice Chairman of the Shanxi Provincial People's Government, spoke, clarifying the work program of the provincial government.

Secondly, it is necessary to vigorously restore and develop agricultural production, striving to reach pre-war levels within two years. Thirdly, it is essential to connect urban and rural relations. In restoring and developing cultural and educational undertakings, Vice Chairman Pei said that it is imperative to strive to enroll all school-age children within three to five years, strengthen secondary, normal, and vocational education, and establish rural night schools and urban workers' literacy classes to eliminate illiteracy in a step-by-step manner.

Introduction to Shanxi Province

[Taiyuan 1st dispatch] Shanxi Province, which was once divided by the enemy, was completely liberated in April this year after the final and thorough annihilation of the enemy. In order to adapt to the needs of large-scale production and construction, the North China People's Government issued a circular to adjust administrative divisions and restore the original system of Shanxi Province. The Shanxi Provincial People's Government was officially established on September 1st.

Shanxi Province is located in the middle reaches of the Yellow River Basin, bordering Hebei to the east, connecting the plains to the south, bordering Shaanxi across the Yellow River to the west, and connecting Suiyuan with the Great Wall to the north, with a corner of the northeast adjacent to Chahar Province. Within the territory are mountains such as Wutai, Hengshan, Taihang, Taiyue, Lüliang, and Yunzhong. The mountains are mostly ditch-type basins, suitable for farming. The Yellow River and Fen River basins have fertile land. The provincial government is stationed in Taiyuan City, specially called Bing.

With the exception of the thirteen counties in Yanbei, which were assigned to Chahar Province, the old Shanxi Province was divided into seven special districts: Xinxian, Xingxian, Yuci, Fenyang, Changzhi, Linfen, and Yuncheng, with jurisdiction over ninety-two counties and one city. The population totals 10,840,014 people.

Shanxi Province has abundant industrial resources, especially coal and iron. The area of coal mining areas in the province is more than 3,248,000 hectares, and the reserves are approximately 2,956 trillion metric tons, with excellent carbon quality. Iron ore is distributed in Gaoping, Changzhi, Pinding, Yuxian, Ningwu, Guanxian, Yangqu, Linxian, Jincheng, Yangcheng and other places. The ore veins are exposed and easy to mine. In addition, salt production is also quite rich, with Anyi and Yuncheng's Lu Salt (also known as Hedong Salt) being the most famous. According to a survey in the 23rd year of the Republic of China (1934), the average annual output was more than 1,286,000 dan, which was sold to Shaanxi, Henan and other areas. In the past, sulfur production was more than 300 tons per year, and the gold mines in Daixian produced 30 taels per day in the past. Gypsum and asbestos produced in Pinglu County are also well-known.

Industrial production in Shanxi Province accounts for 5% of the entire economy. Modern large-scale machine industrial production is mostly concentrated in the Taiyuan urban area. After our army took over, it was operated by the Light and Heavy Industry Management Office of the Taiyuan Military Control Commission. It is planned that by the end of this year, the production of cotton yarn, woolen fabric, and carpets in the textile industry, flour, winemaking, and egg products in the food industry, leather, matches, alcohol, and tri-acids in the chemical industry, steel, machinery in the hardware industry, and cement in the construction industry will reach the level of 1947.

The total length of railways in Shanxi Province is 1,130 kilometers, and the current operating length is 358 kilometers. The main lines include the Shijiazhuang-Taiyuan Railway from Taiyuan to Niangziguan, which is 160 kilometers long (the entire line is open to traffic); the southern section of the Datong-Pukou Railway from Taiyuan to Fenglingdu (the Taiyuan to Lingshi section is open to traffic), which is 481 kilometers long; the northern section of the Datong-Pukou Railway is the section from Taiyuan to Ningwu, which is 188 kilometers long. There are branch lines on the Shijiazhuang-Taiyuan Railway, including the Huangzigou branch line, which is 15 kilometers long; on the Datong-Pukou Railway, there are branch lines in Baijiazhuang, Fenyang, Jiangcun, Guoxian, Changzhi, etc., with a total length of 301 kilometers. The southern section of the Datong-Pukou Railway is currently being repaired from Lingshi to Linfen, and it is expected to be completed by the end of September. The section from Linfen to Fenglingdu is being planned for construction. The section from Huanghouyuan to Ningwu in the northern section of the Datong-Pukou Railway is also being planned for restoration. It is planned to widen the gauge of the southern section of the Datong-Pukou Railway next year or the year after. The main highways in Shanxi Province include the Taiyuan-Ningwu line, the Taiyuan-Fenglingdu line, the Taiyuan-Jiuguan line, the Taiyuan-Jundu line, the Taiyuan-Jincheng line, and the Jincheng-Yumenkou line. There are ten main lines with a total length of 4,634 kilometers, eighteen branch lines with a total length of 1,813 kilometers, and seventy-one feeder lines with a total length of 4,023 kilometers, totaling 10,470 kilometers. Since liberation, the highways that have been opened to traffic are: the Taiyuan-Ningwu line, the Taiyuan-Jundu line (to Fenyang), and the Taiyuan-Jincheng line. The Shanxi Provincial Highway Transportation Bureau has drafted a five-year construction plan. After the five-year plan is completed, there will be 6,061 kilometers of high-quality highways in the province, with smooth traffic during the rainy season, and cars can travel at a speed of more than 70 kilometers per hour.

The cultivated area of agricultural products in Shanxi Province is 50,566,077 mu, with an annual grain output of 58,576,488 dan. The annual output of wheat and millet is more than 16 million dan each, sorghum is more than 9 million dan, and soybeans are more than 1.7 million dan.

In addition, medicinal materials, mountain products, etc. are also exported in large quantities every year.

The main rivers in Shanxi Province that can be irrigated include the Fen River, Qin River, and Sanggan River. The Fen River is more than 1,500 li long and is the longest tributary of the Yellow River. Its basin area is vast, and the soil on both sides is fertile and rich in agricultural products. It is a major economic lifeline of Shanxi.
