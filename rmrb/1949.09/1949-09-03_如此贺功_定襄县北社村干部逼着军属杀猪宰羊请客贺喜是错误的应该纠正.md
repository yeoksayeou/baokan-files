Criticism and Suggestions

　　Such Congratulation
　　Cadres in Beishe Village, Dingxiang County, Force Military Dependents to Slaughter Pigs and Sheep for Feasts and Celebrations and Should Be Corrected

　　According to a letter from the Political Department of the 66th Army, forwarded by the 20th Army Corps: "Comrade Ma Shuangxi, a soldier of this unit, is from Beishe Village, Dingxiang County, Shanxi Province (formerly under Xin County). He was gloriously wounded and performed meritorious service in the Taiyuan Campaign. While Comrade Ma was receiving treatment in the hospital, he received a letter from home stating: 'After receiving the good news of your meritorious service, the village cadres forced us to slaughter pigs and sheep and hold a grand banquet to celebrate. You know how difficult our family's situation is; how could we afford to slaughter a pig or a sheep? So, we haven't held any celebrations yet.'" Based on the above situation, there are likely two reasons: First, the village cadres do not understand the meaning and practice of celebrating meritorious service, mistakenly believing that whoever has good news should host a feast. Second, the village cadres want to take the opportunity to eat and drink, are not considerate of the difficulties of military dependents, and may even consciously increase the burden on military dependents. Regardless of the starting point, this erroneous phenomenon cannot be allowed to occur. If the issue of Comrade Ma Shuangxi's family hosting a feast has not yet been done, the county government should order it to be stopped. If it has already become a reality, the village cadres should be criticized and educated. The method of celebrating meritorious service should first involve mobilizing the masses, holding a conference, performing Yangko dances, and hanging honorary plaques, etc. However, village funds and grain should not be used, nor should there be extravagance and waste. Efforts should be made to be frugal, in order to educate the masses, raise their awareness, and make them truly realize that it is glorious for soldiers to perform meritorious service for the people, thereby enhancing the social status of military dependents.

　　如此贺功
  　定襄县北社村干部逼着军属杀猪宰羊请客贺喜是错误的应该纠正
    据二十兵团转来六十六军政治部之函称：“本部战士马双喜同志，系山西定襄县北社村人（该村原属忻县），在太原战役中光荣负伤，并立了大功。该同志在医院疗伤期间，曾接到家庭来信说：“家里接到你的功臣喜报后，咱村干部逼着杀猪宰羊，大开宴会，来表示给咱家贺喜，你想咱家这样困难，那能杀起条猪？宰起只羊呢？所以直到现在仍未进行贺功。”根据以上情况，估计可能有两种原因：一、村干部不了解贺功的意义及做法，误认为谁家出喜事就应该由谁家来请客。二、村干部想趁机吃喝，不体谅军属的困难，甚至有意识的加重军属负担。无论出发点如何，这种错误的现象是决不能允许发生的。马双喜同志的家属请客贺喜的问题，如果还没有做的话，应由该县政府勒令停止，如果已经演成事实，应给村干部以批评教育。贺功贺喜的方式，应首先发动群众，召开大会，演秧歌，挂光荣匾等方式进行之，但不得动用村财粮款项，也不能铺张浪费，力求节俭，借以教育群众，提高群众觉悟，使之真正认识到战士为人民立功是光荣的，从而提高军属的社会地位。
