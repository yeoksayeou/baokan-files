　　【Baoding Electric】Since responding to the call of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee to enthusiastically launch the movement to save and aid disaster relief, significant results have been achieved by provincial-level directly affiliated organs and local organs, organizations, factories, and schools throughout Hebei Province. In addition to the Party Committee, Military Region, and other directly affiliated organs and more than 50 units in Baoding City, including Party, government, and people's organizations, saving 221,041 jin of millet, 1,655,520 yuan, and large quantities of clothing and cloth for disaster relief, the former Jidong, Jizhong and other state-owned trading departments, directly affiliated departments, organizations, factories, and schools of Party and government leading organs in various districts have also actively responded to the call of the Provincial Party Committee. In addition to deciding to save one or two liang of millet per person per day, they have also donated 100,690 jin of millet, 2,671,660 yuan, 1,900 pieces of clothing and shoes, and 367 bolts of cloth with a high degree of class friendship. The main reason for the enthusiastic development of this movement is that responsible cadres of Party and government leading organs and organizations at all levels have conducted in-depth ideological mobilization among their subordinate cadres and personnel, so that everyone understands the hardship of the people in the disaster areas and the great significance of saving and helping disaster relief. At the mobilization meeting of all personnel of the Cangxian Special Office, everyone learned that nearly 200,000 of the 900,000 disaster victims in the entire special zone were living in extreme hardship, and they unanimously stated that they could not and should not sit idly by in the face of this disaster for the people. The Qingyuan County Party Committee emphasized strengthening the overall concept, and that everyone must provide relief when one place is affected by disaster. The Hengshui Sub-district directly affiliated team proposed "The people's famine is our famine" when discussing disaster relief. On a conscious basis, all staff members fully demonstrated their high degree of friendship towards the disaster victims. The Qinhuangdao Railway Workers' Union issued a call for each person to donate one jin of rice, and all the workers unanimously volunteered to donate 178,250 yuan. Song Shubin, an employee of the former Jizhong Postal Administration, automatically donated 200 jin of millet, and Song Hua donated a cotton quilt and 100 jin of millet. The Handan Public Security Bureau stipulated saving office supplies, electricity bills, etc., and other agency personnel also formulated personal production and saving plans, resolutely implementing the saving and disaster relief movement.

　　河北全省机关团体
  　节约大批款米支援灾区同胞
    【保定电】河北省省级各直属机关及各地机关、团体、工厂、学校，自响应省委号召，热烈展开节约救灾运动以来，已收到显著成绩。除省委、军区各直属机关及保定市党、政、民等五十余单位，已节约小米二十二万一千零四十一斤，款一百六十五万五千五百二十元及大批衣服、布匹救灾外，原冀东、冀中等国营贸易部门，各分区党、政领导机关的直属部门、团体、工厂、学校等百余单位，亦积极响应省委号召，除决定每天每人节省小米一两外，并以高度的阶级友爱捐助小米达十万零六千九百斤，款二百六十七万一千六百六十元，衣服鞋袜等一千九百件，布三百六十七匹。此次运动热烈展开的主要原因是由于各级党政领导机关、团体负责干部，在所属干部人员中进行了深入的思想动员，使每个人都了解到灾区人民的困苦和节约救灾的重大意义。沧县专署全机关人员的动员大会上，大家知道了全专区九十万灾民中近二十万人已生活极苦，对于人民这种灾害，一致表示不能也不应坐视。清苑县委强调加强整体观念，一处受灾必须大家救济。衡水分区直属队在讨论救灾时提出“人民的灾荒，就是我们的灾荒。”在自觉基础上，所有工作人员充分发扬了对灾民的高度友爱精神。秦皇岛市铁路职工会发出每人输捐一斤米的号召，全体职工们一致自愿捐出十七万八千二百五十元。原冀中邮政管理局职工宋树彬自动捐出小米二百斤，宋华捐出棉被一床、小米一百斤。邯郸公安局规定节省办公用具、电费等，其他机关人员也纷纷订出个人生产节约计划，坚决将节约救灾运动贯彻下去。
