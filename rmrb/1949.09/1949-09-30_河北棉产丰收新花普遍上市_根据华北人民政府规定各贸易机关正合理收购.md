　　[Baoding Electric] In the cotton-producing areas of western and southern Hebei Province, the cotton harvest is abundant, and new cotton is continuously entering the market. Local governments and economic departments are purchasing according to cotton price policies to guarantee the interests of cotton farmers and solve their difficulties. Since this spring, due to the active leadership of cadres from Party and government organs at all levels in guiding farmers to fight drought and plant seeds, water more, hoe more, and combat various disasters, the cotton in various places has now matured. The cotton bolls are abundant, presenting a scene of bumper harvest. In Jin County, Luancheng, Shulu, Zhao County and other counties, each mu can generally produce around 100 jin of seed cotton; in Qinghe County, 25% of the cotton fields can produce more than 120 jin of seed cotton per mu; in Shijiazhuang Prefecture, 14 counties planted 1.13 million mu of cotton, which will produce more than 100 million jin of seed cotton. The broad masses of farmers are beaming with joy and are busily picking cotton. In Handan Prefecture, Linzhang, Cheng'an and other counties have picked about 30% of the new cotton; Daming, Ji County and other places have also picked the first round. Currently, new cotton is widely available in various places. At Julu market in the third district of Hengshui, over 10,000 jin of cotton are available at each market session; in Ji County, more than ten major markets average between 20,000 and 40,000 jin of cotton per session. In order to encourage farmers' enthusiasm for growing cotton, protect their interests, and solve their difficulties in selling cotton, local governments, trade companies, and supply and marketing cooperatives are conducting purchases in a planned manner according to the North China People's Government's regulations of 8 to 10 jin of rice per jin of ginned cotton. The Handan Prefectural Commissioner's Office assisted the state-owned North China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company's Handan branch in purchasing 800,000 jin of ginned cotton in 20 days. The company also distributed 1.7 billion RMB to supply and marketing cooperatives in various counties for purchases. In order to solve the food difficulties in major cotton-producing areas such as Wu'an, Yongnian, and Ci County, and stabilize grain prices, the company also agreed with the North China Grain Company's Handan branch to guarantee a fixed cotton-grain price ratio so that cotton farmers would not suffer losses. It has now sent people to transport grain from other places. The Hengshui Prefectural Trade Company and supply and marketing cooperatives have dispatched a large number of cadres to set up cotton collection stations in various places to prevent speculation by unscrupulous merchants, and have transported 200,000 jin of rice to Julu town to implement rice-for-cotton exchanges. The Zhao County Supply and Marketing Cooperative has set up cotton collection agencies in various markets and used 60,000 jin of wheat to exchange for cotton, solving the farmers' difficulties in obtaining wheat seeds. At the same time, the county is preparing to organize more than 700 cotton gins to mobilize farmers and cooperative members to gin cotton and turn seed cotton into ginned cotton for shipment to the cities. The Yongnian County government actively supports private cotton ginning factories and cotton ginning machines, organizing farmers' scattered cotton gins to enable them to obtain 70% of the profits from cottonseed. In Linluo Pass alone, 150 units have been organized. In the process of purchasing cotton, various places have implemented the cotton purchase prices and methods stipulated by the North China People's Government, guaranteeing the interests of cotton farmers. In addition to this year's bumper cotton harvest, most farmers regret planting too little and have expressed that they will definitely plant more cotton next year. Huolu County plans to plant 25% to 30% of the cultivated land area next year.
