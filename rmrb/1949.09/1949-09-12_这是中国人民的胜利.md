　　"This is a Victory for the Chinese People"
    Liu Nianqu
    Having been established for only four months, with its scale still in the initial stages, the Beiping Film Studio, whose central task is the production of newsreels and documentaries, has already completed three productions in succession. The latest, the third production, "Million Soldiers Cross the Yangtze," has surpassed the first and second productions in terms of achievement.

    This is primarily due to the cinematographers who, without shying away from hardship and danger, performed their tasks on the front lines just like the revolutionary soldiers. Anyone with a little knowledge of news photography will fully acknowledge that certain precious materials were not obtained casually. Not just one person, and not just once, a cameraman holding a camera was buried by the mud kicked up by a shell that exploded not far from him; not just one person, and not just once, a cameraman rushing to the front approached the enemy's firepower points together with the demolition team; not just one person, and not just once, a cameraman forgetting the danger entered a city with the vanguard, where there were still remnants of the enemy resisting stubbornly. Thanks to the cinematographers' bravery, decisiveness, and resolute execution of their tasks, we can see the People's Liberation Army crossing the natural barrier of the Yangtze River, breaking through the enemy's defenses built over several months, seizing powerful firepower points, and finally liberating the Kuomintang reactionaries' "capital" Nanjing and Asia's largest city, Shanghai, in the cinema as if we were there, without having to worry at all.

    Although it is possible to shoot the entire fact of crossing the Yangtze in a very planned way, the situation on the battlefield is completely different from that in the studio. All the precious materials obtained at that time, from a few feet to hundreds of feet, had to be carefully edited to fit the theme. In this respect, "Million Soldiers Cross the Yangtze" also has a significant achievement. The beginning briefly explains how the Kuomintang reactionaries launched a massive offensive against the liberated areas, how the Chinese people fought for self-defense, and in the spring of 1949, after the great victory of the Huaihai Campaign, the various units of the People's Liberation Army immediately launched a wave of "Crossing the Yangtze River, Liberating All of China." After the Kuomintang reactionaries rejected the peace agreement recognized by their plenipotentiaries, on April 21, Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu issued the order to cross the river and attack. This was an order that the million soldiers had been looking forward to and were happy to accept. With the support of the broad masses of people in Jiangbei, without the need for warships, just ordinary civilian ships, just ordinary boatmen, just the straw lifebuoys created by the collective wisdom of the people (which are as reliable as American-made rubber lifebuoys, and will never leak even if hit by bullets), they rushed through the滔滔巨浪 (Tāotāo jùlàng. Huge, surging waves), braving the overwhelming artillery fire, and reached the south bank in just over ten minutes, and every revolutionary fighter disembarked like a dragon and a tiger. The natural barrier of the Yangtze River, or the defense line built over several months, could not stop the invincible and unconquerable People's Liberation Army. This was followed by a series of victorious advances, with Nanjing, Suzhou, Hangzhou, and Shanghai being completely liberated one after another. The victorious march of the People's Liberation Army has not stopped, and continues to the south, to the south—liberating all of China. If the campaign to cross the Yangtze River and liberate Jinghu (Nanjing and Shanghai) is one of the important battles of the Liberation War, and one of the most glorious achievements of the People's Liberation Army, then "Million Soldiers Cross the Yangtze" is a systematic, concrete, and vivid record of this important battle and this glorious achievement. Moreover, due to the relationship of written editing, this record not only faithfully reports but also has a profound infectious power.

    It is this profound infectious power that makes us, in the feeling of being on the scene, further realize the brave, fearless, and great heroic spirit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army dedicating itself to the cause of people's liberation, realize the Chinese people's enthusiastic support and love for their own troops, and also realize the evil face of the Kuomintang reactionaries struggling to their death, and we cannot remain indifferent! As Chairman Mao said, "This is a victory for the Chinese people." In order to implement this victory, the million soldiers who crossed the Yangtze are continuing to advance south, and the Chinese people will certainly provide more and greater strength to support the front from all sides. We can hear that "Million Soldiers Cross the Yangtze" is precisely calling on every one of our audience members, every Chinese person. September 6th evening

　　“这是中国人民的胜利”
    刘念渠
    建厂不过四个月，规模仅仅初定，以摄制新闻纪录片为中心工作的北平电影制片厂，已经接连的完成了三号出品。最新的第三号“百万雄师下江南”，成绩是超过了第一、二号出品的。
    这首先得归功于不避艰苦与危险，和革命战士们同样的在火线上执行任务的摄影师同志们。稍有一点新闻摄影知识的人都会完完全全的承认：若干珍贵的材料，实在不是随随便便得到的。不仅一人也不仅一次，手里拿着摄影机的摄影师被在身边不远炸开的炮弹所震起的泥土把整个的人埋没起来；不仅一人也不仅一次，冲在前面的摄影师和和爆炸手一同接近了敌人的火力据点；不仅一人也不仅一次，忘记了危险的摄影师和先锋队伍一同进入了还有残余敌人顽抗的城市。由于摄影师同志们的英勇、果敢、坚决的执行了自己的任务，我们才得在影院里如同身临其境，而又用不着担半点心的看见了人民解放军的渡过长江天险，攻破敌人经营数月的防线，拔取了火力强大的据点，最后，解放了国民党反动派的“首都”南京和亚洲第一大城市上海。
    虽然可以很有计划拍摄全部下江南的事实，而战场上的情况绝不同于摄影棚里的。所有当时得到的珍贵的材料，由几英尺到几百英尺，还得经过细心的、符合主题的编辑。在这一点上，“百万雄师下江南”也有着显著的成就。开头扼要地说明了国民党反动派如何大举进攻解放区，中国人民如何为自卫而战，一九四九年春天，淮海战役大胜利后，人民解放军各部立即掀起了“打过长江去，解放全中国”的热潮。当国民党反动派拒绝了为他们的全权代表所承认的和平协定之后，四月二十一日，毛主席和朱总司令发出了渡江进攻的命令。这是百万雄师盼望已久的并乐于接受的命令。在江北广大人民支援之下，用不着军舰，就是普普通通的民船，就是普普通通的船夫，就是人民集体智慧所创造的稻草救生圈（它比美国制的橡皮救生圈一样可靠，枪弹打中了也绝不泄气），冲过滔滔的巨浪，冒着漫天盖下的炮火，只要十几分钟，就到达了南岸，革命战士个个如生龙活虎一样的舍舟登陆了。长江天险也好，经营数月的防线也好，什么都阻挡不了无坚不摧，无攻不克的人民解放军。跟着是一连串的胜利进军，南京、苏州、杭州、上海相继完全获得解放。人民解放军的胜利行进不曾止住，还继续向南，向南——解放全中国。如果横渡长江、解放京沪的战役是解放战争的重要战役之一，是人民解放军的最辉煌的战绩之一，那么，“百万雄师下江南”就是这一重要战役与这一辉煌战绩的有系统的、具体的、生动的记录。而且，由于书面剪接的关系，使这一记录于忠实报导之外，还具有深刻的感染力量。
    正是这种深刻的感染力量，使我们于身临其境之感中，更进一步的认识了中国人民解放军献身于人民解放事业的勇敢、无畏、伟大的英雄气概，认识了中国人民对于自己队伍的热烈的支援与爱戴，也认识了垂死挣扎的国民党反动派的罪恶面目，而不能无动于中！诚如毛主席所说的，“这是中国人民的胜利”。为了贯彻这一胜利，下江南后的百万雄师正继续的南进，中国人民也必以更多更大的力量从多方面的支援前线。我们可以听到，“百万雄师下江南”恰恰是这样的号召着我们每一个观众，每一个中国人民。　　　　　　　　　　九，六晚
