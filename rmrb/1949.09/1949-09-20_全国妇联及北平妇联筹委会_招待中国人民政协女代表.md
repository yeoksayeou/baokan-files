    [Our Newspaper] The All-China Democratic Women's Federation and the Preparatory Committee of the Beiping Municipal Women's Federation hosted the women representatives attending the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference at the Beijing Hotel at 9:00 AM yesterday. Fifty-four people attended, including Madame Sun Yat-sen Soong Ching Ling and Madame Liao Zhongkai He Xiangning. Cai Chang delivered a welcome speech, and Deng Yingchao reported on the selection of women representatives to the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, pointing out that the tasks of the women representatives are: (1) to concentrate efforts on studying the great plan for national construction, starting from reality; (2) to be serious and responsible, and serve the people; (3) to strengthen learning and strive to implement the resolutions of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. Zhang Xiuyan spoke on behalf of the Preparatory Committee of the Beiping Municipal Women's Federation, hoping that the women representatives participating in the CPPCC would truly serve the people. He Xiangning pointed out in her speech that the future responsibility of the women representatives is to guide the 200 million women to participate in the construction of the new China. At the same time, they must learn from the Soviet Union and strengthen Sino-Soviet friendship. He Xiangning also suggested launching a campaign to comfort the troops. The entire audience immediately agreed. Wu Yifang, Li Dequan, Yu Qingtang, and Li Xiuzhen also spoke successively, expressing their deep feeling of unity and democratic spirit under the leadership of the Communist Party, and expressing their willingness to work hard to serve the people.
