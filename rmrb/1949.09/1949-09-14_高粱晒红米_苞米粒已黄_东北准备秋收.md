　　Sorghum Turns Red, Corn Kernels Turn Yellow
　  Northeast Prepares for Autumn Harvest
    [Report from this newspaper] Northeast News: Currently, in both Southern and Northern Manchuria, sorghum is generally turning red, and corn kernels are turning yellow. Various regions are intensifying their preparations for the autumn harvest. This year, due to flooding in Southern Manchuria and drought in Northern Manchuria, a general crop failure has occurred. For the sake of long-term frugality and preparedness for famine, all regions are emphasizing careful harvesting and threshing, and cherishing crops during the autumn harvest arrangements. Provinces such as Heilongjiang and Songjiang, including counties like Nehe, Keshan, Suihua, Tangyuan, and Jixian, have proposed "cut when ripe, haul as you cut" to prevent autumn rains from making the fields inaccessible for vehicles, and to guard against possible early frost (due to abundant rainfall and low temperatures in autumn). Following the passage of the summer flood season last month and the provision of 30 million catties of grain to assist over 1.1 million disaster victims in Southern Liaoning Province in production and self-salvation to overcome the summer famine, the current work focus has shifted to concentrating efforts on intensifying preparations for the autumn harvest. Liaoxi Province, severely affected by disaster, is focusing on developing sideline production for self-salvation and preparing for the autumn harvest as its current central task. Since many crops in various regions of Southern and Northern Manchuria are not bearing fruit due to drought and flooding this year, and because some areas have experienced Ustilago disease, many counties and districts have paid attention to field cultivation and seed selection in advance to thoroughly eliminate diseases and ensure sufficient good seeds for next year. In Liu Jia District of Shuangyang County, Jilin Province, the method of "selecting the best seeds from each household, and then exchanging them appropriately based on the quality, to ensure neither party loses out" is used for field seed selection. At the end of August, Tiande District organized a seed selection committee to select the best seeds as the standard for seed selection in each village. To compensate for crop failures and prepare for long-term famine, adjusting labor and combining autumn harvesting with sideline production is one of the most important issues in this year's autumn harvest. To this end, many areas in Northern Manchuria are intensifying the rectification of labor exchange and mutual aid organizations.

　　高粱晒红米·苞米粒已黄
　  东北准备秋收
    【本报讯】东北消息：目前南北满之高粱已普遍晒红米，苞米粒已黄，各地正加紧进行各项秋收准备工作。今年由于南满涝北满旱，造成普遍性的歉收，为长期节约备荒计，各地在布置秋收中，特别强调了细收细打，珍惜庄稼。黑龙江、松江三省讷河、克山、绥化、汤原、集贤等县并提出“熟了就割，随割随拉”，以防秋雨大地里进不去车，并防备可能的早霜（因秋天雨量多，气温低）。辽东省继上月份渡过夏汛并以三千万斤贷粮扶助一百一十多万灾民生产自救渡过夏荒后，目前工作中心已转入集中力量加紧准备秋收。灾荒严重的辽西省则以搞副业生产自救与准备秋收，作为目前中心工作。由于今年南北满各地很多庄稼因旱涝而不实成，又加今年部分地区发生乌疸，为彻底消除病害，保证明年有足够的好种籽，不少县区事先都注意了田间培种和选种。吉林省双阳县刘家区则以“谁家好选谁家的，然后再按成色好坏适当交换，保证两不吃亏”方法进行田间选种；天德区八月底就组织了选种委员会，选出最好的种籽作为各村选种的标准。为了弥补歉收及为长期备荒做打算，如何调整劳力，把秋收和副业生产结合起来，是今年秋收中最重要的问题之一，为此，北满不少地区正加紧整顿换工互助组织。
