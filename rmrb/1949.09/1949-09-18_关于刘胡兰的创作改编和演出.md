On the Creation, Adaptation and Performance of "Liu Hulan"
    Luo Qing

The people of Beiping have a feeling for "Liu Hulan" that is a solemn and sublime revolutionary feeling; this feeling will turn into an invincible force, pushing the history of the People's China woven from the blood of millions of revolutionary martyrs like Liu Hulan to even greater glory.

The arousal of this emotion reflects the great appeal of the opera "Liu Hulan," which no one will doubt; but why does the opera "Liu Hulan" have such a great appeal? I think: first, it is because the creation, adaptation, and performance of this opera were all attempts and exercises under different conditions, based on Chairman Mao's literary and artistic thought; therefore, it can more appropriately bring the moving deeds of Comrade Liu Hulan, who "lived greatly and died gloriously," to the stage vividly, reflecting the result to the audience.

Second, it comes from the appeal of Comrade Liu Hulan's heroic deeds themselves. Liu Hulan's heroic deeds, just like the eulogy given to her by our great teacher and dear leader Comrade Mao Zedong, show that she "lived greatly and died gloriously." Moreover, this eulogy added to Liu Hulan's "living greatly and dying gloriously." This is the main source of the opera's appeal. Now, I would like to express some thoughts on these two points.

First, let's talk about the creation, adaptation, and performance of the script:

The script of "Liu Hulan" was originally created by the Combat Drama Troupe. This script was already well-written and had been performed many times in Beiping, Shijiazhuang, and other places, and was quite popular among the audience; but the Literary and Art Troupe of the North China Military and Political University studied and adapted it on this existing and favorable basis. Why? Because the original script had a major shortcoming, namely, that "the audience cannot see Liu Hulan's activities during her lifetime" (see "Writing Before and After Liu Hulan"). This means that the script did not adequately express Liu Hulan's "living greatly," which is a very important and fundamental issue, because if you cannot show Liu Hulan's "living greatly," it is not enough to show her "dying gloriously." This is a major issue related to theme, plot, and its ideological and artistic nature.

Where did Comrade Liu Hulan "live greatly"? Mainly in her flesh-and-blood connection with the masses; in her great collectivism; in her great heroism—which is also the noblest quality of a Communist.

Liu Hulan came from the peasant masses and became an excellent female Communist Party member. She lived and fought in the ranks of the masses, united, organized, led, and educated the masses under the cultivation and leadership of the Party, carried out anti-traitor liquidation, took the lead in production, supported the army and the front, sheltered the wounded, fortified the villages and cleared the fields, stood guard, prevented traitors and spies, and carried out guerrilla self-defense, etc. All of these were to implement the Party's policies and protect the interests of the masses who had turned over; she relied closely on the masses and had infinite loyalty and love for the working people, which is her great collectivism. She always stood at the forefront in the struggle, unafraid of difficulties, unafraid of fatigue, unafraid of danger, unafraid of sacrifice, and used her exemplary actions to influence the masses, which is her great new heroism. Because of this, the masses also showed her unparalleled trust and love. For example, when the enemy surrounded and arrested her, the masses initially surrounded her tightly to prevent her from being exposed, and then they stepped forward one by one to take her place, vying to say to the enemy: "I am Liu Hulan," "…". Shi Laohan, a member of the evil landlord's family, repeatedly recognized Liu Hulan as his daughter "Xiao Xiangzi" to protect her, and finally sacrificed for her. This is a powerful reflection of Liu Hulan's great collectivism and new heroism among the masses.

Chairman Mao's literary and artistic thought teaches us that in literary and artistic practice, the main thing is to fully explore and praise, describe and portray our heroic Chinese revolutionary people (mainly workers, peasants, and soldiers), in the class struggle and national struggle, under the education and leadership of Marxism-Leninism and the Communist Party, the collectivism and new heroism they display. Communists like Liu Hulan are typical embodiments of this collectivism and new heroism, and the main objects of literary and artistic creation and expression. Only such works can truly win the love of the broad revolutionary people and exert a huge role in the self-education of the revolutionary people. The focus of the Military and Political University Literary and Art Troupe's adaptation of the play "Liu Hulan" is mainly on this. To make Liu Hulan's heroic deeds "living greatly" as figurative as possible, so that the theme and thought are more clear and prominent. To make the structure, interweaving, and unfolding of the plot more close, substantial, tortuous, and vivid, and to strengthen its artistic nature, thus adding several scenes, lyrics, and supplementing the accompaniment of some famous songs (such as the Shaanxi-Gansu Red Army Uprising Song and the Internationale), so that the original work has been developed after adaptation.

I think the creation and adaptation of Liu Hulan is one of the commendable methods and directions in Chinese literary practice. This play was created by the Combat Drama Troupe and performed in certain areas, which can be regarded as the first and basic work, which is very valuable; and the comrades of the Military and Political University Literary and Art Troupe drew inspiration from the original work and the broad audience, and then studied and adapted it, which facilitated the improvement and promotion of the work. Although this may still be a preliminary attempt, it is precisely a very necessary and meaningful work. That is: whoever has mastered the material may boldly write it out; whoever finds any finished products in the literary and art circles should study, learn, and, if necessary, develop and adapt them; it is said that before the Military and Political University Literary and Art Troupe adapted and performed "Liu Hulan," some literary and drama groups in Beiping were also preparing to adapt and perform it, which is a good phenomenon. Of course, this work must be very serious, principled, and conditional, rather than arbitrarily changing its appearance and creating novelty; it must improve the ideological and artistic nature of the original work. This kind of adaptation may and should be multi-faceted, for example, from stage opera to stage opera, this is only one aspect; but the stage play like Liu Hulan can also be adapted into other forms, especially movies, which are more convenient in terms of technology, economy and space. We can also adapt novels into stage plays, especially movie scripts. It is said that someone intends to put New Children's Heroes on the screen, which are all very urgent and important tasks, and it is hoped that they can be done more planned and systematically in the future. Such a method has two major meanings: First, this will combine the work of popularization and improvement, and it is also a good internal division of labor and cooperation method in the literary and artistic front; it is also very beneficial to the development of the entire literary and artistic movement. Because today, the development of our entire literary and artistic work and the production of works are still extremely insufficient and unbalanced, doing so may remedy it; Second, from the creation and adaptation of Liu Hulan, and even adapting her and New Children's Heroes and other works into movie scripts, it is still a task that the Chinese literary and artistic circles should strive to achieve in the future. Like Liu Hulan and New Children's Heroes, they are the products of the patriotic self-defense war and the anti-Japanese war, and the Chinese literary and artistic circles' record and reflection of these two great historical struggles, especially in quantity, are still very small and insufficient, which is a shortcoming that must be worked hard to make up for. Yes, today, facing the national victory and entering the new tasks of great production construction and national defense construction, literary and artistic work should serve the workers, peasants and soldiers under this new historical task, to reflect and encourage the collectivism and new heroism shown in these two increasingly high struggles, which is certain. However, history should not be cut off. Our literary and artistic workers still have the need and responsibility; under the appropriate division of labor and use of strength, to systematically and systematically, excavate and express the heroic achievements of the people in the anti-Japanese war, patriotic war, and even the land revolution stage, to educate the newly liberated people across the country, to educate the vast urban people (including the working class itself), and even to educate our descendants, so that everyone will never forget that without the heads and blood of millions of martyrs in history, we cannot achieve today's victory, there is no new democracy and socialism; to encourage our people and future generations to continue and further promote the collectivism and heroism of the martyrs in the construction of the new China, from production, learning various labor struggles and competitions. This performance of Liu Hulan, the appeal to millions of viewers in Beiping is a vivid example, is it not important to say such work?

Secondly, let's talk about the special significance of performing the play "Liu Hulan" in today's cities:

The heroic story of Liu Hulan took place in a rural village in Wenshui County, Shanxi Province, in the winter of 1946. What was the situation like in the winter of 1946, when the Patriotic War was in its initial stage? At that time, the American imperialists were about to complete their shameless so-called "mediation" conspiracy, and aided and supported the reactionary bandit troops of Chiang Kai-shek, Yan Xishan and others, and frantically attacked our various liberated areas, while our army was adopting strategic defense and carrying out large-scale mobile warfare to create favorable conditions to annihilate the enemy; the temporary withdrawal from cities such as Zhangjiakou also occurred during this period. This was the most difficult stage of the Patriotic War, that is, "when the sky seemed to be dark," the storm had not yet passed. At that time, the American imperialists and Chiang Kai-shek and Yan's reactionaries were indeed overwhelmed by temporary victories and danced with joy. Let's not talk about it again. At that time, there were also many people in the country who underestimated the party, the army, and the people's power armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and were frightened and pessimistic by the temporary arrogance of the Chinese and foreign reactionaries, and were shaking and attaching themselves to the enemy; however, at this critical historical juncture, what about the Chinese working class party and the peasant class in the liberated areas? The unparalleled self-confidence and fortitude spirit shown by Liu Hulan and the peasant masses around her is an epitome. This is the source of our strength, the source of victory! Today, the millions of viewers in Beiping, thinking of the source when drinking water, love and respect Liu Hulan so much, which is completely natural and should be the case. Liu Hulan's greatness and glory is the greatness and glory of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese proletariat, and the peasant class; it is also the greatness and glory of the entire people and nation. Our people have learned from Liu Hulan how to love the Communist Party, love the people's army, love their own working people, their own hometown, and their own motherland! Learned how to carry out tenacious and intelligent struggles with open and hidden enemies to protect the interests of the people and the country; learned how to work for the Party, the army, and the people with a selfless and fearless spirit, even at the cost of self-sacrifice and a heroic spirit that regards death as home.

Liu Hulan's spirit is a particularly good mirror for those so-called "democratic individualists," so-called "nationalists" or "patriots" who are unfortunately "favored" and summoned by American imperialism today. Liu Hulan is the daughter of a peasant, and she is not even twenty years old. She has neither been nurtured by "Western culture" nor does she even understand what the "long Chinese culture" mentioned in the mouths of American reactionaries is; however, she grew up in the soil of such a remote rural area in China, and under the influence of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, she has such extraordinary wisdom and courage. She recognizes and despises the reactionary enemies of the US, Chiang, and Yan, and has no illusions or fears, showing the awe-inspiring integrity of "wealth cannot be moved, and force cannot be subdued." She is wholeheartedly and unswervingly loyal to the Communist Party and the people, becoming a docile tool and a loyal servant. This is because she has no "individualism," only "the interests of the public." "The interests of the public" is "democracy." "Individualism" is linked to the bourgeoisie's "minority democracy." This is outdated and reactionary today. Only the proletariat's "collectivism" has the interests of the public and the democracy of the people. Personal interests and personal democracy are subordinate to the interests of the people and the democracy of the people. From Liu Hulan, we can see the entire Party, the entire new China, and the world of the people. They are all the same principle and the same logic. From Liu Hulan's several basic characteristics, she is higher than the surrounding masses, and she has made great contributions to the Party and the masses. However, she is not proud or arrogant and does not think she is great; on the contrary, she regards everything she has as less important than the interests of the Party and the masses. She does not seek to be known by others but is known by herself, does not seek to be respected by others but is respected by herself, and does not seek eternal life but obtains eternal life. "You will always live in your mother's heart, and in the hearts of the people!" (Liu's mother cried to Hulan's tomb) This "mother" is not only her physical mother, but also Mao Zedong's Party, and our motherland. This "public" is not only the small Yunzhou Xicun, but all the Chinese people, and even the progressive people all over the world. She and the Soviet heroine Dan Niang will compete with each other and be immortal. Therefore, I hope that all patriotic elements with "democratic individualism" can learn from Liu Hulan's people's wisdom and courage, from her great collectivism, new heroism, that is, the people's democracy, draw experience and lessons, dare to despise imperialism and all internal and external reactionaries, and sever any ideological and emotional ties with them, and truly sit on the side of the Chinese people, then the creation, adaptation, and performance of the play "Liu Hulan" will have a higher significance today!

　　关于刘胡兰的创作改编和演出
    罗青
    北平市人民对于“刘胡兰”的情感，是一种庄严而崇高的革命情感；这感情将变成一种不可战胜的力量，把象刘胡兰那样千百万革命先烈的鲜血所交织成的人民中国的历史，更光辉的推向前进。
    这情感的激发，反映了“刘胡兰”这部歌剧的巨大的感召力，这是谁也不会怀疑的但；“刘胡兰”这部歌剧，为什么会有这样巨大的感召力呢？我以为：第一、是由于这部歌剧的创作、改编和演出，都是在不同的条件下，本着毛主席的文艺思想而尝试和习作的；因而，它就比较能恰如其份的，把刘胡兰同志这一可歌可泣的“生的伟大，死的光荣”的事迹，生动的搬上舞台，反映到观众面前的结果。
    第二、是由于刘胡兰同志的英雄事迹本身所具的感召力来的。刘胡兰的英雄事迹，正如我们伟大的导师，亲爱的领袖毛泽东同志给她题的赞辞一样，表现了她“生的伟大，死的光荣。”更由于这个赞辞，而增加了刘胡兰“生的伟大，死的光荣。”这便是这部歌剧的感召力的主要源泉。现在，我想就此两点，发表一些感想。
    先就剧本的创作、改编和演出来谈：
    “刘胡兰”剧本原是战斗剧社所创作，这个剧本本来就写的不错，曾在北平与石家庄等地演出多次，也颇受观众的欢迎；但华北军大文工团在这个现成的和有利的基础上，又加以研究和改编，为什么呢？因为原剧本有一个主要缺点，即在于“看不到刘胡兰生前的活动”（见“写在刘胡兰前后”一文）。这就是说，剧本对刘胡兰的“生的伟大”，还表现的不够，这就是一个很重要而又很基本的问题，因为表现不出刘胡兰“生的伟大”，就不足以显示她“死的光荣”。这是有关主题、剧情及其思想性与艺术性的大问题。
    刘胡兰同志“生的伟大”在那里呢？主要的在于她和群众的血肉联系；在于她伟大的集体主义；在于她伟大的英雄主义——这也就是共产党人最高贵的品质。
    刘胡兰从农民群众中来，变成了一个优秀的女共产党员，她又生活、战斗在群众的行列中，在党的培养与领导下，团结、组织、领导和教育群众，进行了反奸清算，带头生产，拥军支前，掩护伤员，坚壁清野，站岗放哨，防奸防特，游击自卫等等的斗争。这些，都为了贯彻党的政策，保护群众的翻身利益；她才紧紧的依靠群众，对劳动人民具有无限的忠诚和热爱，这就是她的伟大的集体主义。她在斗争中永远的站在最前列，不怕困难，不怕疲劳，不怕危险，不怕牺牲，用自己的模范行动去影响群众，这就是她伟大的新英雄主义。因为如此，群众对她也表现了无比的信任和热爱。比方：当敌人围捕她时，群众始而将她团团围住，不让她暴露，继而不惜一个个挺身以代，争着对敌人说：“我就是刘胡兰”，“……”。恶霸地主的本家石老汉，曾一再认刘胡兰是她的女儿“小香子”以掩护她，终于为她而牺牲，这便是刘胡兰伟大的集体主义与新英雄主义在群众身上有力的反映。
    毛主席的文艺思想，教导我们在文艺的实践上，主要的就在于要我们充份的去发掘和颂扬，描写与刻划我们英雄的中国革命人民（主要是工农兵），在马列主义和共产党的教育领导下，在阶级斗争与民族斗争中所表现的集体主义与新英雄主义。而共产党人如刘胡兰，则更是这种集体主义与新英雄主义的典型体现者，和文艺创作与表现的主要对象。只有这样的作品，才能真正赢得广大的革命人民的爱好和发挥对革命人民的自我教育的巨大作用。军大文工团对刘胡兰一剧的改编，其着力点主要在此。将刘胡兰的英雄事迹“生的伟大”，尽可能的加以形象化，使主题与思想更较明确和突出。使剧情的结构、穿插、展开更较紧密、充实、曲折而生动，而加强其艺术性，从而增改了若干场面，歌词，补充了一些名曲的伴奏（如陕北红军起义歌及国际歌等），这样就使得原作经过改编而得到发展了。
    刘胡兰的创作和改编，我觉得是中国文艺实践上一种可取的方法和方向之一。这个剧由战斗剧社创作出来，并在一定的地区予以公演，这可算做到了第一步的和基本的工作，这个工作是十分可贵的；而军大文工团的同志们，从原作和广大观众中吸取了启示，又加以研究和改编，比较便利的做了改进和提高一步的工作。虽然这仍可能是初步的尝试，但恰是很必要的很有意义的工作。这就是：谁掌握了材料，谁就不妨大胆的把它写了出来；谁发现了文艺界有什么成品，谁就加以研究，学习，必要时并加以发展和改编；听说在军大文工团改编和演出“刘胡兰”以前，北平市就有些文艺戏剧团体，也准备从事改编和演出，这是很好的现象。当然，这种工作必须是十分严肃的有原则和有条件的，而不是随意的改头换面，标新立异的乱改一通；必须是提高原作的思想性与艺术性的。这种改编，也可能和应当是多方面的，比方，由舞台歌剧而改编为舞台歌剧，这只是一方面；但象刘胡兰这个舞台剧，还可以改编成其他形式，特别是电影，那在技术、经济和空间等条件上，就更多方便，我们还可以把小说改编成舞台剧特别是电影脚本。听说有人拟把新儿女英雄传搬上银幕，这都是十分迫切而重要的工作，今后希望能更有计划，有系统的去作。这样的作法，有两个重大的意义：其一、这将使普及与提高的工作相互结合，而且是文艺战线上一种很好的内部分工与合作的办法；对整个文艺运动的开展也是很有利的。因为今天我们整个文艺工作的发展和作品的产生，还极其不足和不平衡，这样做就可能有所补救；其二、从刘胡兰的创作和改编，甚至把她和新儿女英雄传等作品，改编为电影脚本来说，还是今后中国文艺界应当努力实现的一个任务。象刘胡兰和新儿女英雄传，是爱国自卫战争和抗日战争的产物，而中国文艺界，对于这两段伟大的历史斗争的纪录与反映，至其在数量上还非常微末和不足，这是必须努力弥补的一个缺憾。是的，今天面临着全国胜利，进入伟大的生产建设和国防建设的新任务，文艺工作应当为这种新的历史任务下的工农兵服务，以反映和鼓舞在这两种日形高涨的斗争中所表现的集体主义与新英雄主义，这是肯定的。然而，历史是不应划断的，我们的文艺工作者，还完全有必要，有责任；在适当的分工和力量的使用之下，有计划的，有系统的，把抗日战争，爱国战争，甚至土地革命阶段的人民的英雄业迹，发掘与表现出来，以教育全国新解放的人民，教育广大城市人民（包括工人阶级自己），乃至教育我们的后代子孙，使大家永远的不要忘记，没有历史上千百万先烈的头颅、鲜血，便不能取得今天的胜利，便没有新民主主义与社会主义；以鼓舞我们的人民和后代，在新中国的建设中，从生产，学习各种劳动斗争与竞赛中，永远继续并进一步发扬先烈的集体主义与英雄主义。这次刘胡兰的演出，给北平千百万观众的感召力就是一个生动的例证，难道说这样的工作不重要吗？
    其次，就刘胡兰一剧在今天的城市中演出的特殊意义来谈：
    刘胡兰的英雄故事，发生在一九四六年冬天山西文水县一个农村里，一九四六年的冬天，正当爱国战争的初期。当时是一种什么情景呢？那时美帝国主义者，正要罢了无耻的所谓“调处”阴谋，援助与支持蒋介石阎锡山等反动匪军，向着我各个解放区疯狂进攻，而我军正采取战略防御，进行大规模的运动战，创造有利条件，以歼灭敌人的时候；张家口等城市的暂时撤守，也就在这个时期。这是爱国战争最艰苦的阶段，也就是“当着天空中似乎是黑暗的时候”，暴风雨还未过去，当时美帝和蒋阎反动派，固然曾被暂时的胜利冲昏头脑，手舞足蹈。这且不再谈它，而当时国内也曾有不少的人，对马列主义和毛泽东思想所武装的党，武装的军队，武装的人民力量估计不足，被中外反动派的一时猖狂所吓倒而悲观失望，正在动摇附敌；然而，在这种历史的严重关头，中国工人阶级的党和解放区的农民阶级是怎么样呢？刘胡兰和她周围的农民群众，所表现的无比的自信心与刚毅精神，便是一个缩影。这就是我们力量的源泉，胜利的源泉！今天，象北平市千百万观众，饮水思源，这样的热爱刘胡兰，崇敬刘胡兰，完全是很自然，而也很应当的事。刘胡兰的伟大和光荣，也就是中国共产党，中国无产阶级和农民阶级的伟大和光荣；也就是全体人民和民族的伟大和光荣。我们的人民，从刘胡兰身上，学习到如何热爱共产党，热爱人民的军队，热爱自己的劳动人民，自己的家乡和自己的祖国！学习到如何与公开的及隐蔽的敌人进行顽强机智的斗争，以保卫人民和国家的利益；学习到如何以忘我的，奋不顾身的精神而为党、为军队、为人民而工作，以至不惜自我牺牲视死如归的英雄气概。
    刘胡兰的精神，特别对于今天不幸的美帝国主义所“垂青”而召焕的所谓“民主个人主义”，所谓“民族主义”或“爱国主义”分子是一面最好的镜子。刘胡兰是一个农民的女儿，年纪还不到二十岁，她既没有什么“西方文化”的薰陶，甚至也不懂得如美国反动派血口中所说的“中国悠久文化”是什么；然而，她在中国那样偏僻的农村的土壤上生长，在马列主义与毛泽东思想的浸润下，具有这样非凡的智慧和气魄，她认清并卑视美蒋阎反动敌人，绝无幻想与畏惧，表现了“富贵不能移，威武不能屈”的懔烈节操。她对共产党和人民，则全心全意，忠贞不二，成为一种驯服工具和忠实公仆，这由于她没有“个人主义”，只有“众人利益”，“众人利益”就是“民主”，“个人主义”与资产阶级的“少数民主”相联系，这在今天，已经是过时的和反动的东西，只有无产阶级的“集体主义”才有众人的利益和人民的民主；个人的利益与个人的民主，是从属于人民的利益和人民的民主的。从刘胡兰一个人看我们全党，看整个新中国，看人民的世界，都是一个道理，一个逻辑。从刘胡兰的若干基本特点来说，她高出于周围的群众，她对党和群众，都有很大供献，然而她毫不骄傲自大和觉得自己了不起；相反的，她把自己的一切，看得比党比群众的利益轻得多，她不求人知而人自知，不求人敬而人自敬，不求永生而得永生。“你永远活在娘的心上，活在众人的心上！”（刘母上坟时哭胡兰语）这个“娘”不仅是她的肉体的母亲，而是毛泽东的党，而是我们的祖国，这个“众人”，不仅是小小的云周西村，而是全中国人民，甚至全世界进步人民。她与苏联女英雄丹娘，将相互比美而永垂不朽。因此，我希望一切有“民主个人主义”的爱国分子，能够从刘胡兰所具有的人民的智慧与气魄，从她伟大的集体主义，新英雄主义，也就是人民的民主主义学习，吸取经验教训，敢于卑视帝国主义和一切内外反动派，和它们割断任何思想与情感联系，把屁股真正坐在中国人民当中，则刘胡兰一剧的创作改编和演出，在今天也就具有更高的意义了！
