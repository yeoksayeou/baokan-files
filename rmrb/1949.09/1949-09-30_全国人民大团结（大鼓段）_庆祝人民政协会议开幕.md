The sun rises in the east, a sky full of red, and ten thousand rays of light shine on Beijing. The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference opens in Beijing, and the people of the whole country cheer in unison. An unprecedented event has been written into the history of the Chinese people's revolution. Old China is forever destroyed and no longer exists, and New China is born, eternally green. Nearly a hundred years of foreign aggression have been overthrown, and thousands of years of cannibalistic feudalism have been swept away. These founding days are earth-shattering, and the great unity of the people is victorious and bright.

Six hundred and sixty-two people's representatives represent all aspects and strata of the country. The Communist Party of China leads, and the people's leader is Mao Zedong; Chairman Mao Zedong is comparable to a big red star high in the mountains. Chairman Mao shines on the revolutionary road, and the Chinese people follow him and stride forward. With Chairman Mao, the Chinese people move towards victory, and only with the Communist Party can the People's Political Consultative Conference be convened.

The Political Consultative Conference was also held three years ago, but the resolutions of that Political Consultative Conference were kicked away by the traitor Chiang Kai-shek. Chiang Kai-shek is a running dog of imperialism; how can a dog not eat excrement? After he tore up the Political Consultative Conference resolutions, he showed his true colors in a vicious and evil manner, mobilizing millions of troops to attack the Chinese people. The old Political Consultative Conference proved a truth: proving that Chiang Kai-shek and his accomplices, as long as it is beneficial to the Chinese people, they will not tolerate even a trace of it. The old Political Consultative Conference had a great harvest: it gave the Chinese people a very clear education: that there can be no compromise with the traitor Chiang and the Kuomintang. Either the enemy must be completely overthrown, or the enemy will be allowed to slaughter at will. Two paths of life and death, victory and defeat are clearly distinguished; one of the two must be followed, and it is impossible to take the middle ground.

Since the Opium War, the Chinese people have suffered disasters; they have been oppressed year after year, and their lives have been like those of cattle and horses. Imperialism, old feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism run rampant everywhere. The three enemies join forces and attack our Chinese people; under the leadership of the Communist Party, the working class follows the leader Mao Zedong; and joins hands with the people of the whole country, bravely and tenaciously fighting on the front lines. Hong Kong seamen have a glorious history, the Kailuan coal mines had a big strike, the "February 7th" martyrs of the Beijing-Hankou Railway shed fresh blood, and the "May 30th" movement in Shanghai was famous; coordinating with the Northern Expeditionary Army to fight, there were three armed uprisings by workers.

After the failure of the First Great Revolution, Chairman Mao led the struggle to the countryside; ten years of civil war, eight years of resistance against Japan, and more than three years of the Liberation War; gritting his teeth and taking the lead, not afraid of bloodshed and sacrifice. All for the sake of establishing a New China, all for the sake of independence, freedom, peace, unity and prosperity. This is why the New China must be led by the workers, and establish a revolutionary camp based on workers and peasants. Unite all democratic classes, twist all domestic nationalities into one rope, and implement the people's democratic dictatorship, so that the great revolutionary fruits can be guaranteed. Now that we have won, the countless revolutionary martyrs have made great contributions. The People's Liberation Army has fought hard for twenty-two years, and the Communist Party has fought heroically for twenty-eight years; defeating the Kuomintang government aided by the United States, and defeating millions of Chiang Kai-shek's counter-revolutionary troops. The working brothers must remember firmly: the enemy has not been completely eliminated; China's economy is still backward, and the people's living standards are not yet sufficient; the current work is very arduous, and difficulties will still occur on the road to victory. A lot of work has been done in the past, like the first step of the Long March. We must support the front lines and increase production, and strive for the early completion of national liberation. Consolidate the united front, and guard against lurking and disruptive enemies. Be brave, diligent and hardworking, and create our own happiness and civilization. Unite all peaceful and free nations, and join the world family. We must resolutely lean to one side and stand in the same camp with the Soviet Union; all the new democratic countries unite to defend world peace. Internal and external reactionaries tremble before us, and the people of the whole world cheer with joy.

　　全国人民大团结（大鼓段）
    ——庆祝人民政协会议开幕
    苗培时
    太阳东升满天红，霞光万道照北京，北京开了人民政协会，全国人民欢呼同声。在中国人民革命历史上，写下了空前的大事一宗。旧中国永远灭亡不存在，新中国从此诞生万年青。近百年外来侵略都打倒，几千年吃人封建一扫清。这开国日子翻天覆地，全国人民大团结胜利光明。
    人民代表六百六十零二位，代表着全国各方面各个阶层。中国共产党做领导，人民领袖是毛泽东；毛泽东主席好有一比，好比那高高山上的一颗大红星。毛主席照耀着革命大道，中国人跟着他大步前行。有了毛主席中国人民走向胜利，有了共产党人民政协才开成。
    三年前也开过一次政协会，那政协决议都被蒋贼一脚蹬，蒋介石是帝国主义大走狗，狗不吃屎怎能行？他撕毁政协决议后，穷凶极恶日现原形，发动了人马几百万，向中国人民来进攻。旧政协证明了一个真理：证明着蒋介石和他帮凶，只要是对中国人民有利益，一丝一毫他们也不容，旧政协有一条大收获：给中国人民的教育很分明：对那蒋贼国民党，想要妥协万不能。或者是把敌人彻底推翻了，或者是让敌人屠杀任意行。生生死死两条道，胜利失败分得鲜明；两条必须按着一条走，想走中间万不成。
    自从那鸦片战争后，中国人民遭下灾星；成年累月受压迫，生活牛马一般同，帝国主义老封建，官僚资本到处横行。三个敌人拧成一股劲，向着咱中国人民来进攻；工人阶级在共产党的领导下，跟着领袖毛泽东；和全国人民来携手，英勇顽强打前锋。香港海员有光荣历史，开滦五矿大闹罢工，京汉路“二七”烈士流鲜血，在上海“五卅”运动大有名；配合着北伐部队来作战，有工人三次武装起义兵。
    第一次大革命失败后，毛主席领导转向农村斗争；十年内战八年抗日，三年多的解放战争；咬着牙关带头干，不怕流血和牺牲。为只为建立一个新中国，为只为独立、自由、和平、统一和强盛。这就是新中国必须工人来领导，建立工农为基础的革命阵营。各民主阶级团结好，各国内民族拧成一条绳，实行那人民民主来专政，这伟大的革命果实才有保证。到而今我们胜利了，那无数革命先烈都有大功。解放军二十二年艰苦奋战，共产党二十八年英勇斗争；战胜了美帝援助的国民党政府，战败了那蒋匪反革命的数百万兵。工人弟兄要牢牢记着：敌人最后还没肃清；中国经济还落后，人民生活也不够水平；眼前工作十分艰巨，胜利道上困难还要发生。过去工作作了不少，好象那第一步的万里长征。我们要支援前线加劲生产，争取那全国解放早日完成。巩固团结统一战线，防备着潜伏捣乱的敌人。勇敢勤劳真苦干，创造咱自己的幸福和文明。团结那和平自由各民族，参加那世界大家庭。必须坚决一边倒，和苏联站在一个阵营；各新民主的国家联合起，保卫世界的持久和平。内外反动派在我们面前乱发抖，全世界的人民都欢呼高兴。
