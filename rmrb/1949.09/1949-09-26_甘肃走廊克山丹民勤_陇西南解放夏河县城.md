    Xinhua News Agency, Northwest Front, 25th: The county seat of Xiahe (Labrang), the center of the Tibetan area in southwestern Gansu, was liberated on the 20th of this month. When the People's Liberation Army marched into the city in formation, people of all ethnic groups, Tibetan, Mongolian, and Han, lined the streets to welcome them. The Xiahe County People's Government and the Labrang City Garrison Command have been officially established. Labrang is famous for its Labrang Monastery, built mostly on the banks of the Daxia River. The buildings are magnificent and resemble a royal palace. The monastery houses more than 2,000 lamas. The area is located in the midst of mountains, more than 900 meters above sea level, and has a very cold climate. It is a key route connecting Gansu, Qinghai, Sichuan, and Xikang to Tibet, and a trade center for Mongolians, Hans, and Tibetans. Since it was established as Xiahe County in the 16th year of the Republic of China, commerce has flourished, with fur being the main export. In the surrounding thirteen villages, there are approximately 17,000 Tibetans (excluding lamas). The urban area has more than 5,000 residents, of whom seven-tenths are Tibetans.
