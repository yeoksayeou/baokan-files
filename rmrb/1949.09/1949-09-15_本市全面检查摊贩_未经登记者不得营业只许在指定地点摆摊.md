　　City Conducts Comprehensive Inspection of Street Vendors
  　Unregistered Vendors Prohibited from Operating, Allowed to Set Up Stalls Only in Designated Locations
    [This City News] The city's street vendors have been reorganized, registered, and issued licenses, and are operating in designated locations. However, recently the number of street vendors has gradually increased again, some of whom are unregistered, and some of whom have strayed from their designated locations. According to statistics, there are approximately 400 unregistered vendors in the Deshengmen Market, while half of the stalls in the Huangchenggen South Section and Dongheyan Market have moved out. This not only affects the business of law-abiding vendors but also hinders traffic order. Therefore, it is urgent to strengthen management. After careful discussions by relevant municipal government departments, it was decided to launch a comprehensive inspection based on two principles: (1) Unregistered vendors are not allowed to operate; (2) Mobile registered vendors must return to designated locations to operate. Stalls are strictly prohibited in locations where stalls are already prohibited. This decision has been earnestly implemented since September 10th with the close cooperation of various vendor management offices, district offices, and public security bureau police stations. The government will impose appropriate penalties on individuals who deliberately violate the regulations. (Municipal Government Information Office)

　　本市全面检查摊贩
  　未经登记者不得营业只许在指定地点摆摊
    【本市讯】本市摊贩已经过整理，并登记发照；在指定地点营业。然近来街头摊贩又渐增多，其中有一些是未经登记的，有一些是由各指定地点跑出来的。据统计：德胜门市场未登记营业的约有四百户左右，而皇城根南段及东河沿市场则有一半摆摊跑出。这不但影响守法摊贩的营业，且妨碍交通秩序，因此，亟须加强管理。经市府各有关单位数度慎重商讨后，决定根据两项原则展开全面检查：（一）未登记摊贩，不得营业；（二）流动的已登记的摊贩，必须迁回指定地点营业。已规定不准摆摊的地点一律不准摆摊。此项决定已于九月十日起在各摊贩管理处、区公所、公安分局派出所密切配合下认真执行，对个别故意违犯规定的分子，政府将予以适当处分。  （市府新闻处）
