　　Traveling Companions
　　By Soviet writer, Panova, translated by Su Ling, and proofread by Cao Jinghua
　　Part One: Night
　　Chapter Three: Dr. Bilov
　　“The fighting is on, yes… this is only the beginning.”
　　“Ah, I know this is only the beginning! I saw someone from Vilnius. It’s frightening… I don’t want to talk about it. Ask me something else. What else do you want to ask me?”
　　“Lili and Igor…”
　　“Lili is on duty. She said they will be sent off in a couple of days. Igor has already left with the first group.”
　　“Sent where?”
　　“To Pskov.”
　　She started to cry. He let go of her hand, looking at her in alarm. She had never cried before. He used to be jealous of how good she was to her son. The son was a good-for-nothing – lazy, rude, always wandering outside; the doctor blamed her for always indulging the son, always saving the best food for him when they shared meals. But now he understood – or so he thought: she knew that her son’s future was special, a future of going to war; didn’t she often say, “It doesn’t matter, after he graduates from school, he’ll join the army, and they’ll teach him a lesson there.” She knew he would be in the first group sent to dig trenches; that’s why she pitied him, spoiled him…
　　“Sonya, don’t cry!” the doctor pleaded. “Why are you crying as if he’s already dead? You’re crying like that!”
　　“I’m not crying for him. If it weren’t for work, I would have gone myself. I’m crying because I can’t bear to hear these news.”
　　Yes, work, he hadn't asked a single question about work.
　　“Work is still the same. Sometimes it’s really irritating: at a time like this, some people still want to get dentures. There was a silly woman who brought some gold. She has two steel teeth, and she wants to replace them with gold teeth. I got angry and said to her: You've picked a fine time to get dentures. She felt offended and went to another dentist. Let her go.”
　　“Let her go,” he mechanically repeated.
　　They were silent, looking at each other with kind, tearful eyes, sitting in silence for a long time. A layer of skin had formed on top of the coffee in the cups, they had forgotten about it. They had also forgotten about the fruit drink.
　　There was another knock on the door. Danilov came in, apologized, and announced that the locomotive was about to be attached.
　　“What?” the doctor asked. “Already attached? So, we’re leaving, Sonya…”
　　Danilov, afraid of intruding on their farewell, went out, and then the doctor's wife went out. The tall, slightly stooped doctor's wife walked in the middle of the railway track, strands of silver-gray hair peeking out from under the brim of her old black hat. The short doctor, looking valiant in his military uniform, moved his feet, walking side by side with her – he was seeing her off.
　　Before the war, the doctor kept a diary. Deep down, he felt he was a writer. Because there had been doctors who were also writers: like Chekhov (note one), Veresaev (note two). Ah, or perhaps he wasn't a novelist, but a commentator, like… "Marat" (note three), once, when he told his wife this idea, she continued on. Her ridicule offended the doctor, so he didn't tell her about keeping a diary. He kept it secretly. Especially wary of the children. He didn't know that his wife and daughter secretly took the notebook out of the drawer and read it from beginning to end.
　　Note one: Chekhov (A. Chekhov; 1860-1904) Russian novelist, playwright.
　　Note two: Veresaev (B. Veresaev; 1867-) Received medical education, Soviet writer.
　　Note three: Marat (Marat; 1744-1793) One of the leaders of the French Revolution, writer, orator.
　　Writing was very satisfying, because every tiny thing, written with literary flair, possessed a profound meaning, sometimes even a great significance. If the doctor wanted to write about the bad things about his friends, he wouldn't write their real names, but use A, B, C, D, etc. instead. He was afraid that those people who often came to his house to play cards would discover his diary after his death and publish it, and be slandered by society because of his records. When he went out, he put the diary in a large envelope, tied it with string, and sealed it with sealing wax.
　　"Sonya," he said, handing the sealed envelope to his wife with both hands, as if holding a sacred icon. "Please keep this safe, and only open it under… certain circumstances. Do you understand?…"
　　After meeting his wife on the train, he wanted to write. He opened a thick, unused notebook, sniffed the oilcloth cover with a satisfied expression, sighed, and wrote:
　　"July 2nd, 1941. Sonya came."
　　He suddenly didn't want to write anymore. The train was moving. It was cool in the car. The ventilator was humming… She sat in this corner, she's on the tram now, or is she still waiting?… The doctor leaned his head on the notebook, sitting motionless like this for a long time.
　　"Mr. A is a strange person," the doctor wrote the next day, after regaining his mood. "I understand Danilov, I understand our sympathetic, albeit serious, surgical nurse. I understand that nurse wearing a nurse's hat, caring for me, who is very happy when I praise her for folding the napkins well. I understand the drunk Mr. C, I understand everyone on the train, but I just can't understand Mr. A. But he is the closest person to me here, or at least he should be the closest person to me, because we are colleagues, we can talk for a long time, but somehow, I don't want to talk to him. He offered me a cigarette, very politely, but there's nothing but politeness. I talk to him about current events; but he talks to us completely using those words published in the newspaper. I talk to him about our practical problems, even if I deliberately say some foolish things, he agrees with what I say. I asked about his family, he is a bachelor, living with his old mother.

    第一部　夜
    第三章　比洛夫医生
    “打着呢，是的，……这只是开头。”
    “呵，我知道这只是开头！我看见从维尔诺来的一个人。真怕人……我不愿说了。你问我别的事吧。你还有什么话问我呢？”
    “莉莉和伊戈尔……”
    “莉莉在服务呢。她说过两天就会派他们去的。伊戈尔已经跟第一批出发了。”
    “到那出发了？”
    “到普斯科夫。”
    她哭起来了。他放了她的手，惊慌的看着她。已往她从来没哭过。已往他妒嫉她对儿子好。儿子是一个不成器的人——懒惰，粗鲁，永远在外边游荡着；医生怪她总是姑息儿子，分吃食物的时候，总把好的留给儿子。可是现在他明白了——他觉得是这样的：她晓得将来儿子的命运是特殊，是出征作战的命运；她不是常说吗：“不要紧，等他学校毕业以后，参加军队，那儿会把他教训好呢。”她早知道他会第一批被派去挖战壕呢；因此她就怜念他，娇惯他……
    “梭妮，别哭吧！”医生恳求着。“你哭什么呢，就象他已经阵亡了似的，你这么哭着！”
    “我不是哭他呢。假如要不是工作的话，连我自己也要去了。我哭的是不能听这些消息。”
    是的，工作呵，对于工作他一句话也没有问过。
    “工作还是那样的工作。有时真气人：这样的年光，而有人还要装牙呢。有一个傻女人，拿些金子来。她有两只钢牙，她想改装金牙。我火起来了，就对她说：你可找到装牙的好时候了。她怪了，就去找别的牙医去了。尽她去吧。”
    “尽她去吧，”他机械的重复着。
    他们默然不语了，慈祥的泪眼，彼此相视着，沉默的好久的坐着。杯里的咖啡，结了一层白皮，他们把这忘了。把果子露也忘了。
    又有敲门声。达尼洛夫进来，说了一声对不起，就通知说马上车头就挂上了。
    “什么？”医生问道。“已经挂上了？那么，我们要开车了，梭妮……”
    达尼洛夫怕妨碍他们夫妇辞别，就出去了，然后医生太太出去了。高个儿的，微微弯着背的医生太太，在铁道中间走着，一缕缕银灰的发丝，从黑色的旧帽檐下露出来。小个儿的医生，雄赳赳的穿着戎装，移着脚步，同她并排走着——他送她呢。
    战前医生是记日记的。在心灵的深处，他感到自己是文学家。因为从前有过医生而兼作家呢：比如柴霍甫（注一），韦列沙耶夫（注二）都是的。呵，或者他不是一位小说家，而是时论家，就象……“马拉”（注三），有一次，当他把这个意思告诉太太的时候，她就接着说。她这嘲笑把医生得罪了，因此，记日记的事情，他不告诉她。他偷偷的记着日记。特别是忌讳孩子们。他却不知道太太和女儿悄悄的把笔记本从抽屉里取出来，把它从头看到底呢。
    注一：柴霍甫（Ａ．Ｃｈｅｋｈｏｖ；１８６０—１９０４）俄国小说家，剧作家。
    注二：韦列沙耶夫（Ｂ．Ｖｅｒｅｓａｅｖ；１８６７—）曾受医学教育，苏联作家。
    注三：马拉（Ｍａｒａｔ；１７４４—１７９３）法国大革命领袖之一，作家，演说家。
    写作是很快意的事，因为每一件极小的事，用文学的笔调把它写出来，就具有一种深长的意味，有时甚至于有伟大的意义。如果医生要写朋友间的坏处的时候，就不写真姓名，而用甲、乙、丙、丁等来代替。他怕常到他家来打牌那些人，在他去世之后，把他的日记发现出来发表的时候，因他的记载而受到社会的诽谤。他出门的时候，把日记装到一个大封套里，用绳子捆好，用火漆封起来。
    “梭妮，”他说着，就象捧圣象似的用双手把这封起的封套递给太太。“请你把这保存着，只有在……情况下，才能打开。你明白吗？……”
    在车上同太太见面之后，他想写作了。他打开一本没有用过的厚笔记本，带着心满意足的神情，把那油布封面嗅了一下，叹了一口气，写道：
    “一九四一年七月二日。梭妮来。”
    他突然又不想写了。火车在开着。车里很凉爽。通风机嗡嗡的响着……她在这角里坐过呢，她现在上了电车呢，或者还在等呢？……医生把头俯在笔记本上，一下不动的好久的这样坐着。
    “甲某真是一个怪人，”第二天，医生恢复了心情之后，这样写着。“我了解达尼洛夫，了解我们的有同情心的，虽然严肃的外科女护士。了解那位戴着护士帽，关心着我，当我夸奖她餐巾叠得好的时候，就非常高兴的那位女护士。了解醉汉丙某，了解列车上的每一个人，可是甲某我就无论如何也不了解的。可是他是这儿我最亲近的人，至少也应该是我最接近的人，因为我们是同行，我们可以长谈，可是不知怎的，我总不愿和他交谈。他请我抽烟，很客气，可是客气之外，什么也没有的。我跟他谈时事；可是他却完全用那些在报纸上发表出来的话同我们谈。我同他谈我们实际上的问题，就让我故意说些怎样糊涂话也吧，他也同意我说的。我问起他的家庭，他是一个光身汉，同老母亲住在一起。
