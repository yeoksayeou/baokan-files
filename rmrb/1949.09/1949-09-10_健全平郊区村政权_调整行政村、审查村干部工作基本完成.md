To strengthen the village governments in the suburbs of Beijing, the Suburban Work Committee of the Beijing Municipal People's Government has basically completed the adjustment of administrative villages and the review of village cadre work, in order to coordinate with the Farmers' Association to lead suburban farmers in land reform and lay a solid foundation for vigorously developing suburban agricultural production in the future. Since the beginning of July, they have led the district governments of various suburbs to carry out the work of adjusting the administrative villages and reviewing the village cadres. As of the end of August, except for the 17th District, which is still in progress, the remaining districts have been successfully completed. At the beginning of the liberation of Beijing, the suburban farmers, under the leadership of the People's Government, destroyed the puppet Baojia system. From this mass movement, a large number of activists emerged. By the end of April, the new village governments, composed of these activists as the backbone, had been preliminarily established. At that time, the Municipal Government's Suburban Work Committee had not yet been established, and the districts were focusing on mobilizing and organizing the masses, paying insufficient attention to the appropriate division of administrative villages. Some administrative villages followed the old township divisions, resulting in an excessive number of households and relatively weak leadership by the village cadres. For example, Dongran Village in the original 17th District had as many as 1,323 households, and four administrative villages in the original 16th District had more than 1,000 households each. Other districts also had this phenomenon. Some administrative villages had too few households. For example, among the administrative villages under the original 25th District, as many as 42 had fewer than 200 households, which excessively dispersed the leadership of the district government. After the establishment of the Municipal Government's Suburban Work Committee, in order to correct the above shortcomings, it was decided to make adjustments, and the adjustment standards were determined as follows: the number of households under each administrative village should be between 200 and 800, not too many or too few, and the distance between natural villages within the same administrative village should not exceed five li. This work was formally deployed after the completion of the district division adjustment in the suburbs in June. At the beginning of July, each district started with the inspection of the work of the village cadres, and combined the review and adjustment of the village cadres in July and August. Now, the administrative villages are actively handling the handover matters after the adjustment, and have begun to carry out education on unity and mutual assistance among the village cadres.

　　健全平郊区村政权
  　调整行政村、审查村干部工作基本完成
    【本市讯】本市人民政府郊区工作委员会，为使平郊的区村政权更为健全与巩固，以便协同农会领导郊区农民进行土地改革，并为今后大力发展郊区农业生产奠定强有力的基础，自七月初开始领导各郊区区政府进行调整郊区行政村与审查村干部的工作以来，至八月底止，除第十七区尚在继续进行外，其余各区均已顺利完成。本市解放之初，郊区农民在人民政府领导下，摧毁了伪保甲制度。从这一群众性的运动中，涌现出大量积极分子。到四月底止，以这些积极分子为骨干而组成的新的村政权初步建立成功。当时，市府郊区工作委员会尚未成立，各区则因集中力量于发动与组织群众，对行政村的适当划分，注意不足。有些行政村系沿用旧有乡的区划，以致户数过多，村干部的领导力量相对地薄弱。如原十七区的东冉村，多至一三二三户，原有十六区有四个行政村，户数均在一千以上，其他各区也有此种现象。有些行政村则户数过少，如原二十五区所辖行政村中，户数在二百以下者多至四十二个，使区政府的领导力量过于分散。市府郊区工作委员会成立后，为纠正上述缺点，决定加以调整，并确定调整标准为：每一行政村所辖户数应为二百至八百之间，不能过多或过少，同一行政村内各自然村间的距离应不超过五里。此一工作当六月份郊区区划调整完毕后，即已正式布置。至七月初各区均从检查村干部的工作入手，于七、八两月内结合审查与调整村干部的工作同时进行。现在各行政村正在积极办理调整后的交接事宜，并已开始于村干部中进行团结互助的教育。　　　　　　　（市府新闻处）
