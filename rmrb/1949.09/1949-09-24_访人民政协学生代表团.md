　　Visiting the Student Delegation of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference
　　Jin Feng
　　The student delegation, composed of ten representatives, is obviously the youngest among all the CPPCC delegations. They are carrying out the will entrusted by over a million Chinese students and represent the victory of the Chinese students' struggle goals over the past thirty years. They exude joy and liveliness amidst solemnity and dignity. Representing the Chinese students of the 1950s, they, though young, have diverse experiences. Each has fulfilled the mission that Chinese students should fulfill in this historical era, depicting the epitome of this generation of Chinese students' hard struggles.

　　Representatives such as Xie Bangding, Zhou Shouchang, Huang Hezheng, Ma Jun (Zhang Xiwen), Ding Li, and Yan Fumin all persisted in the anti-American and anti-Chiang struggles in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. Like most Chinese students, they once dreamed of building the country through industry, saving the country through education, reviving China's economy, and transforming life through literature. With such good dreams, from 1944 to 1946, Xie entered the Geology Department of Southwest Associated University, Zhou entered the Chemistry Department of Jiaotong University, Ding entered the Education Department of Henan University, Yan and Huang entered the Economics Departments of Central University and Peking University, and Ma entered the Journalism Department of Fudan University. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the Kuomintang launched an anti-people civil war, and its corrupt-to-collapse rule and the increasingly obvious aggression and enslavement of China by American imperialism shattered their good dreams and those of most Chinese students. From grief and despair, they turned to struggle and hope, stepping forward one by one, leaving the library, and fighting alongside the vast number of students against the Kuomintang's machine guns, water cannons, secret agents, flying fortresses, special criminal courts, prisons, and death, experiencing the Kunming "December 1st" Movement, the protests against American soldiers' atrocities, the "May 20th" anti-hunger and anti-civil war movement, and the anti-American and pro-Japan movement. Over the past three years, some were arrested and imprisoned (such as Ma Jun), some were expelled and wanted, fleeing to Hong Kong to continue their student movement (such as Zhou Shouchang and Huang Hezheng), some went to the liberated areas (such as Ding Li and Yan Fumin), and some continued to stay in schools to persist in their work, welcoming liberation (such as Xie Bangding). By 1949, they had all participated in the National Student Congress and served as executive committee members of the All-China Students' Federation.

　　While they were shedding blood in struggle, being imprisoned, and fleeing, in Yan'an in the Northwest Liberated Area and Harbin in the Northeast Liberated Area, two other representatives in the delegation—Nie Weiqing, the son of a liberated peasant, and Li Xiuzhen, the daughter of a worker—were happily studying and working. They were nurtured and protected by the People's Liberation Army and the People's Government under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. The People's Government provided them with good schools, and the People's Liberation Army defended and ensured their stable study life. They supported the army on the front lines, went to the countryside to do land reform work, helped peasants to stand up, and diligently studied at school, preparing to better serve the people. This year, they were also elected as representatives to attend the National Student Congress and served as vice chairpersons of the All-China Students' Federation.

　　The other two representatives, Fang Xianyu and Sun Zongfen, students from Tianjin Women's Normal School and Wuhan University, are representatives of the rapid progress of a large number of intellectual youths under the development of the nationwide victory. They are activists who emerged from the high tide of welcoming and celebrating liberation. Long subjected to the deception and oppression of the Kuomintang's reactionary rule, they immediately rushed towards the light upon liberation, uniting students and teachers in schools, carrying out ideological transformation and reforms in the school system and curriculum, and gradually unfolding the study of New Democracy.

　　Xie Bangding, a student at Peking University, experienced the entire student movement of the People's Liberation War era, from the "December 1st" Movement to the liberation of Beiping. After participating in the National Student Congress, he was elected as the chairman of the All-China Students' Federation. Now, with irrepressible excitement and joy, he repeatedly said: "The CPPCC has convened, and the Central People's Government is about to be established. It is the first time in history that we students can participate in discussing such major national affairs. This is truly a great event, and students all over China should applaud and cheer for it." He solemnly stated: "Our participation in such a meeting is by no means something that each representative's individual experience can bear such glory. This is the result of the struggle of all Chinese students over the past thirty years, especially the result of the unprecedented heroic struggle of Chinese students over these thirty years." He also said with a smile: "We have moved from yesterday's prison to today's victory. I believe that we Chinese students have worked hard for New Democracy in the past, and in the future, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, we will, together with the people of the whole country, face the rising sun of the new China and march along the road of construction!"

　　访人民政协学生代表团
    金凤
    由十个代表组成的学生代表团，显然是全体人民政协代表团中最年轻的一个，执行着百余万中国学生托付的意志，代表着三十年来中国学生斗争目标的胜利，他们在严肃庄重中带着欢快活泼。代表着五十年代的中国学生，他们虽然年轻却有着各个不同的经历，各自尽了中国学生在这历史时代所应尽的使命，正描绘出了这一代中国学生努力斗争的缩影。
    代表团中谢邦定、周寿昌、黄鹤桢、马骏（张希文）、丁力、晏福民等都是曾在国民党统治区内坚持反美、反蒋斗争的。和大多数中国学生一样，他们曾做过工业建国，教育救国，经济复兴中国，文学改造人生等等的美梦。带着这样的好梦，从一九四四到四六年，谢进了西南联大地质系，周进了交通大学化学系，丁进了河南大学教育系，和晏黄进了中央大学和北京大学的经济系，马则进了复旦大学的新闻系。抗战胜利后，国民党发动了反人民的内战以及它腐败到要崩溃的统治、美帝的日益明显的侵略和奴役中国，一一击碎了他们和一般中国学生的好梦，由悲愤绝望走向斗争和希望，一个个挺身而出，走出图书馆，和广大同学一起，与国民党的机枪、水龙、特务、飞行堡垒、特种刑事法庭、牢狱和死亡进行了斗争，历经昆明“一二一”运动、抗议美军暴行运动、“五二○”反饥饿反内战运动、反美扶日运动等等。三年来，有的被捕坐牢（如马骏），有的遭受开除通缉，流亡到香港继续从事学运（如周寿昌和黄鹤桢），有的投奔到解放区去（如丁力和晏福民），有的继续留在学校坚持工作，迎接解放（如谢邦定）。到一九四九年他们都参加了全国学代大会，并都担任了全国学联的执委。
    而在他们流血斗争，坐牢，流亡的同时，在西北解放区的延安和东北解放区的哈尔滨，代表团中其他两位代表—翻身农民的儿子聂维庆和工人的女儿李秀贞却正在欢欣学习着和工作着，他们受到中国共产党领导的人民解放军及人民政府的扶育和卫护。人民政府供给他们良好的学校，人民解放军捍卫着和保障着他们安定的读书生活。他们劳军上前线，下乡做土地改革工作，帮助农民翻身，在学校里则勤奋学习，准备更好地为人民服务，今年也都被选为出席全国学代大会的代表，并都担任了学联的副主席。
    另两位代表方先宇和孙宗汾是天津女师和武汉大学的学生，他们是全国胜利形势发展下大批知识青年飞速进步的代表，是从迎接解放、庆祝解放的高潮中涌现出来的积极分子，他们长期受着国民党反动统治的欺骗和压制，一旦解放，立即奔向光明，在校内团结同学师长，进行思想改造和学制课程的改革，逐步展开新民主主义的学习。
    谢邦定是北京大学的学生，他经历了这整个人民解放战争时代的学运，从“一二一”运动一直到北平解放，参加全国学代大会后，被选为全国学联的主席。现在他带着抑制不住的兴奋和欢喜，连连说着：“人民政协召开了，中央人民政府要成立了，我们学生能参加讨论这样的国家大事，这还是历史上的第一次，这真是件大喜事，全中国的学生都要为它拍掌欢呼的”。他又郑重地申明：“我们能参加这样的会议，决不是每个代表个人的经历能担当得起这样的光荣，这是全体中国学生三十年来奋斗的结果，尤其是这三十年来中国学生空前英勇斗争的结果。”他又笑着说：“我们已从昨天的牢狱走向今天的胜利。我相信，我们中国学生过去为新民主主义努力斗争着，今后更要在毛主席和中国共产党的领导下，和全国人民一起，迎着新中国升起的朝阳，沿着建设的大道迈进！”
