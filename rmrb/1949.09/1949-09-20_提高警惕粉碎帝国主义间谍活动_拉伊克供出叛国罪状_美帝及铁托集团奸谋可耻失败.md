Xinhua News Agency, Budapest: The trial of state criminal Rajk and his accomplices opened publicly in Hungary on the 16th, according to TASS. The indictment was presented by the Chief Prosecutor of Budapest, Aralpi Chiula. Approximately 300 representatives from various Hungarian people's organizations and foreign embassies were present. Representatives from Hungarian and foreign news media were also present.

The trial began in the morning with the reading of the Hungarian prosecutor's indictment.

Subsequently, the main defendant, László Rajk, who had successively served as the Hungarian Minister of Interior and Minister of Foreign Affairs, was interrogated.

In response to questions from the Chief Magistrate, Rajk confessed to all the crimes he had committed. Rajk confessed that after returning to Hungary from France in 1930 (where he had absorbed leftist ideas), driven by adventurous motives, he established contact with the Hungarian left-wing revolutionary student movement. He was arrested in 1931. His relative, Lajos Bokor, who worked in Horthy's political police and knew Rajk well, introduced him to Hetényi, the head of the political section of the police department. Hetényi told him that if he signed a confession stating that he was willing to cooperate with the police and engage in espionage within the revolutionary movement, he would be released immediately. Thus, Rajk, who held Trotskyist views at the time, readily agreed to sign such a confession. After receiving his first assignment from the police, Rajk infiltrated the ranks of revolutionary youth students at the university. In 1932, due to his betrayal, 17 people were arrested, and to avoid exposing Rajk's identity as an informant, the police also arrested him, but quickly released him. Among those arrested were Károly Olt, Gyula Schöpflin, and others.

He committed one despicable act after another, and the most outstanding leaders of the revolutionary youth became victims of these acts. In 1934, Ferenc Rózsa, Andor Kálmán, Erzsébet Kozma, and others, became victims because of the spy and informant Rajk, who had by then transferred to the ranks of the underground propaganda and agitation center of the Communist Party in Budapest. For the sake of concealment, Rajk was arrested again, but he was released before the trial began.

The Chief Magistrate asked him: How many times did you inform on people to the police?

		Contacted Political Police
		Framed Hungarian Communist Revolutionary Leaders; Exposed Names of Strike Organizers

The defendant answered: I can't remember the total number. I regularly reported to the police agencies the revolutionary leaders I knew and their work.

Rajk went on to describe how, in addition to supplying the police agencies with information, he used every possible means to assist it in dismantling the Communist Party's underground movement.

In 1934, Hungary began a strong fascization. At the same time, a policy was adopted to fascize the trade unions and turn them into Mussolini's trade unions. The masses of Hungarian working people resolutely fought against this, and the situation became increasingly tense. By the end of 1935, the inevitability of the outbreak of incidents was clearly felt. At this time, Rajk, on the orders of Horthy's secret police, transferred to work in the construction workers' union. After hearing that the construction workers planned to hold a general strike, Rajk told the secret police the names of the organizers of the strike - Communist Party members Antal Apró, Imre Bika, and others, and later organized a demonstration of construction workers for the sake of espionage activities, according to the instructions of his masters. The police arrested the leaders of the Communist movement active among the construction workers, whose names Rajk had reported to the police agencies in advance. Rajk himself managed to "disappear." The "price" of the spy and informant Rajk increased. He was already in contact with the head of the secret police himself, Szombathelyi-Schweinitzer. Rajk was advised to "disappear" from Hungary. He appeared in Czechoslovakia. According to the instructions of the police agencies, Rajk was to gradually infiltrate the Communist Party's underground centers and report their activities to the Hungarian police agencies. The defendant claimed that, fearing being completely exposed by some erroneous step, he was forced to play the role of a Communist Party member and did not do anything special in Czechoslovakia. While in Pozsony (Bratislava), Rajk received an assignment from Szombathelyi-Schweinitzer to go to Spain to discover the names of Hungarian Communists actively participating in the Spanish People's Liberation struggle, and at the same time to frustrate the ranks of the Hungarian Rakosi Battalion (a part of the International Brigades) as much as possible.

		Entered Spain and France and Contacted Trotskyites

In Spain, Rajk posed as a Hungarian Communist who had repeatedly suffered persecution from the Hungarian secret police. This enabled him to become the secretary of the battalion's Party Committee. Utilizing his position, Rajk carried out sabotage and Trotskyist propaganda. On the eve of the decisive battle of the Ebro River, he falsely accused the battalion's political commissar, László Haas, thereby sowing discord within the battalion and reducing its combat effectiveness. Rajk was later exposed and expelled from the Party.

Rajk confessed that he then abandoned the ranks of the fighters for the freedom of the Spanish people, illegally crossed the French border, and was detained in France. A group of Yugoslav Trotskyites were actively engaged in activities in international concentration camps. Rajk said that he established close contact with these Yugoslav Trotskyites and engaged in sabotage activities shoulder to shoulder with them. The defendant said that in the Gurs camp, he was summoned by officers of the French "Second Bureau" and asked to provide him with information about the people in the concentration camp. He took a list full of Yugoslav names from the drawer of the table and checked the names I mentioned. I knew that he also considered them to be the leaders of the Trotskyist group. He then told me that he knew the activities of this group. Later, I often met these Yugoslavs in the office of the "Second Bureau," and it was clear to me that they, like me, were acting according to the instructions of this officer.

According to Rajk's confession, he remained in concentration camps in France until 1941. In the spring of the same year, a German committee came to the concentration camp to recruit labor. The committee was led by a major of the secret police, whose name Rajk could not recall. The major summoned Rajk and suggested that Rajk go to Germany, from where he would be helped to enter Hungary. The secret police major told Rajk that he was helping Rajk at the request of Hungarian secret police officer Péter Hain. The major also told Rajk that he was concerned about some Yugoslavs in the concentration camp. He showed Rajk a list, which was the same list that Rajk had seen earlier in the hands of the officer of the French intelligence agency.

Rajk further confessed that about 150 Yugoslavs who were in the same concentration camp as Rajk at the time, asked this secret police major to help them return to Yugoslavia. The defendant said that he told the secret police about the representatives of these Yugoslav Trotskyite activities. He was satisfied with the description I gave to the latter, and said that he was willing to carry out the request of these Yugoslavs.

This group of Yugoslavs also went to Germany with Rajk.

Rajk pointed out that he did not know exactly what these Yugoslavs' attitude was toward the then Yugoslav government. From the point of view of the secret police, they were completely reliable people.

The defendant confessed that Imre György returned to Hungary in the same way as he did. Rajk said: "His social views were no different from my political views. I was convinced of this while still in France."

		Returned to Hungary with the Help of German Secret Police
		Continued to Infiltrate the Communist Party as a Saboteur of the Revolution

As soon as Rajk returned to Hungary, he gradually infiltrated the ranks of the Communist Party's underground movement. He re-established contact with the secret police and, on Hain's orders, had Imre György infiltrate an organization of the Communist Party. The defendant said that he had György meet with László Gács. In 1942, the police arrested many leaders of the Communist Party's underground movement. I later heard that this was mainly the result of György's activities. As a result of espionage activities, Rózsa and Schönherz were arrested.

Rózsa, one of the leaders of the Communist Party's underground movement, was tortured to death during interrogation by the secret police. Schönherz was hanged. Because Rajk's name had also appeared in court, he was also arrested, but was only sentenced to six months in prison.

Once released, Rajk continued his espionage activities in the ranks of the Communist Party's underground movement. According to the defendant, in 1944, the Hungarian military intelligence agency, unaware that he was a police agent, arrested him. This happened when Szálasi was serving as head of government. He was subjected to court-martial. Rajk said: I was afraid of being sentenced to severe punishment, or even death. During a secret interrogation, I told how I had faithfully served the secret police since 1931, and I asked that my brother Andor Rajk and my superior Szombathelyi-Schweinitzer be called to testify.

Rajk's case was then transferred to the civil court. But later, in view of the advance of the Soviet army, he was deported to Germany along with other prisoners. The leaders of the Hungarian liberation movement (Bajcsy-Zsilinszky and others), who were arrested at the same time as Rajk, were either shot or sentenced to long prison terms.

Rajk's delayed release had two purposes: first, to avoid exposing Rajk's true colors in front of the underground movement members and hindering his reputation; second, to portray Rajk as a person who had not been executed for his superficial "Communist" activities, and had escaped very fortunately.

The defendant went on to say how in Germany he asked Stopli (who, like Rajk himself, was also a spy and informant, and intended to find a way to go to the American occupation zone) to find Szombathelyi-Schweinitzer in the American occupation zone, and to tell Szombathelyi-Schweinitzer that he—Rajk—was about to return to Hungary.

		Infiltrated the Leading Organs of the Hungarian Communist Party
		Conspired to Overthrow the People's Democratic System on the Instructions of the US Imperialist Espionage Agency

The defendant confessed that when he returned to Budapest, the Hungarian Communist Party was already operating legally. The leading organs of the Communist Party were unaware of my connection with the secret police. I was seen as one of the outstanding Party members.

Utilizing this environment, the cunning and treacherous spy and informant Rajk stubbornly and gradually infiltrated the Party's leading organs. He was appointed as the secretary of the Party organization of Greater Budapest. Soon after, Lieutenant Colonel Kovács, a member of the US military delegation attached to the Allied Control Commission, visited Rajk. He told Rajk that Szombathelyi-Schweinitzer in the US occupation zone had told him that Rajk had colluded with the Hungarian police; he also suggested that Rajk work for the American espionage agency. Rajk accepted this suggestion; as he said in his confession in court, Rajk had handed over several important secret documents to the American espionage agency.

Rajk said: When I told Kovács that Trotskyites and right-wing groups of certain Hungarian political parties were carrying out anti-Soviet activities in factories and institutions and were actively striving to have their cronies appointed to leading positions, Kovács told me that he knew about this and that it was being done with the knowledge of the United States.

From this time on, Rajk began to serve his new masters, the US imperialists, zealously.

On the orders of the American espionage agency, Rajk had tried his best to weaken the strength of the Hungarian Communist Party, which was supported by the broadest masses of the Hungarian people. Rajk claimed: "Our goal was to restore capitalism in the country."

Rajk described in detail in court his activities harming the Hungarian people, detailed his espionage connections with the former US Ambassador to Hungary, Chapin; and also detailed how, when he occupied the position of Hungarian Minister of Interior, he was following the instructions of the American espionage agency to place those people in the ministry whom he knew were serving the British and American espionage agencies.

Rajk confessed that in early 1946, Kovács contacted Rajk with Zöldi, who was used by Rajk to enable his people to occupy key positions, so that these people could later be used to achieve his criminal ultimate goal—overthrowing the democratic government and the people's democratic system.

Rajk said: In early 1946, Kovács contacted me with another agent of the American espionage agency, Márton Himler, who came to Hungary as an escort of Hungarian war criminals. Himler had been urging him to unite the anti-Soviet nationalist elements within the Communist Party, to establish a group, and thereby disintegrate the strength of the Hungarian people. In the autumn of 1946, Himler said that he would no longer maintain contact with Rajk, because in the future this contact would continue through the Yugoslavs.

The defendant said that he did not place his people in leading positions suddenly. Rajk claimed that this was only realized after a considerable period of time in accordance with the instructions of Tito and Ranković. This was the same line pursued by the Americans, because the work of Tito and Ranković closely coincided with that of the American espionage agencies. I have several facts at hand to prove this connection. I know that many prominent Yugoslav politicians were secret police agents recruited from concentration camps in France. In 1945, the United States mainly sent their people to Hungary through Yugoslavia, and the Yugoslav leaders knew that these people were American agents. When I met with Ranković in the summer of 1947, I particularly understood this connection between the Yugoslav leaders—Tito, Ranković, and others—and the American espionage agencies.

		US Imperialism Sent Spies to Hungary Through Yugoslavia
		Rajk Was Commanded by the Tito Group

In answering the questions of the Chief Magistrate, the defendant confessed that although he had colluded with the American espionage agency, he had established contact with the representatives of the Yugoslav espionage agency in 1945, at which time he still did not know what kind of people Tito, Ranković, and their accomplices actually were. Rajk said that he met the defendant Brankov in 1945, and later when Rajk served as Minister of Interior, Brankov often visited him. In their meetings, Brankov tested Rajk and told him about Tito's policies.

Rajk said: From my reply, Brankov understood that I agreed with Tito's nationalist and essentially anti-Soviet policy. Later he frankly told me that he was the commander of the Yugoslav espionage agency in Hungary, and asked me to provide him with various secret intelligence about the domestic political situation.

Brankov conveyed to me the greetings of the Yugoslav Trotskyites, who I had met in French concentration camps. Currently they all hold important positions in the Yugoslav state.

The defendant further confessed how, when he was on vacation in Yugoslavia, he received great respect and gratitude there because of his "friendly relationship" with the Yugoslav espionage agency.

		Trotskyites
		Occupy Leading Positions in Yugoslavia and Maintain Contact with US Espionage Agencies

The defendant said that when I was staying in Yugoslavia, I fully understood that Trotskyites occupied leading positions in Yugoslavia, and that they all maintained contact with the American espionage agencies. Not only Ranković, Đilas, and their friends, but even Tito himself had connections with the American espionage agencies.

Rajk described in detail the secret talks he had with Ranković at that time. In this meeting, Ranković told Rajk that if he did not cooperate to realize the goals set by Tito himself, then he (Rajk) would be exposed in front of the Hungarian Communist Party.

The defendant said: In my reply to his words, I told him that these threats would not achieve their goals. If I cooperated with them, it was not because I was afraid, but because my views coincided with their views.

Ranković then showed me a photographic copy of the oath I signed in 1931 to work for the Hungarian secret police. He said he got the document from the Americans, because Horthy's archives had been transported from Hungary to the West. I wanted to know why the Americans would give him this document. Ranković replied that there was no need to hide the truth from me, that the Tito group had close ties with the Americans. Ranković emphasized that therefore I (Rajk) would receive all the instructions given to me by the Americans through Tito and Ranković.

Rajk said that he believed that Tito, Ranković, and their group had established contact with the Americans a long time ago. It would not be possible to achieve such close cooperation in a short period of time. In my opinion, Tito had been hired by the Americans a long time ago, and apparently they had used some facts that were unfavorable to his reputation.

		Stole Confidential Documents and Sent Them to Tito; Used Authority to Release Foreign Spies

The defendant confessed that he had handed over several documents concerning state secrets to Yugoslav spies. Rajk said that after his meeting with Ranković, following Ranković's instructions, he intensified his activities to place Trotskyites, nationalists, and other anti-people elements in more important responsible positions.

Ranković ordered Rajk to help the parties of Balogh and Pfeiffer win the 1947 parliamentary election. As Minister of Interior, Rajk gave all kinds of assistance to the propaganda carried out by these two parties.

The defendant accepted Ranković's instructions, which was to use his position in the Central Committee of the Hungarian Workers' Party to convince the Party's leading organs that it was impossible to fight on two fronts at the same time—both against the pro-fascist right-wing parties in the country and against the right-wing Social Democrats, thereby supporting the right-wing Social Democrats.

Carrying out these and later instructions issued by the Yugoslav agents of British and American espionage agencies, Rajk dissolved the Communist Party organizations in the police force, and began to build anti-democratic armed forces, seeing them as the pillar for overthrowing the democratic government.

After receiving instructions passed to him through Brankov (who was Rajk's liaison with Ranković and Tito), Rajk mobilized virtually the entire police force, under the pretext of needing to protect Tito (who was then going to Hungary to sign a treaty of friendship), to organize a welcome for this American agent that would emphasize his particularly high status. The government had forbidden Rajk from taking certain excessive measures to welcome Tito, but he still had the whole of Budapest elaborately decorated.

The defendant admitted that, in his capacity as a member of the Political Bureau of the Hungarian Workers' Party, after learning the contents of the Cominform resolution, he notified the defendant Brankov before the resolution was published. Rajk cited the names of several agents of foreign espionage agencies, whom he had used his official positions as Minister of Interior and Minister of Foreign Affairs to enable to occupy leading positions in important state organs. He also confessed that he had helped several important leaders of the exposed fascists escape abroad. Rajk used his position to exert all the power he could to release foreign spies, Trotskyites, and nationalists who were then imprisoned.

		Conspired to Sabotage Eastern European Friendship with the Soviet Union Under the Instigation of US Imperialism and Yugoslav Spies

In answering the questions of the Chief Magistrate, the defendant described in detail the circumstances of his meeting with Ranković after the hunting party, which Rajk had arranged for Tito near the Kelebia railway station. The defendant said that during our talks, Ranković had told me that the governments of the people's democracies must be overthrown, that these countries must be prevented from establishing socialism, and that these countries must be separated from the Soviet Union. Bourgeois democratic governments must be restored, and a path of developing capitalism must be adopted. Ranković said that these governments must be oriented towards the United States. Thus, an alliance headed by Yugoslavia would be created, which would receive the support of the United States. This alliance would serve as a base for military aggression against the Soviet Union. I told him that I did not understand what methods Tito wanted to use to implement this policy, because there were some contradictions between Yugoslavia's situation and the plans of its leaders. Ranković replied that since the country's liberation, neither Tito nor the entire Yugoslav government had sought to establish a people's democratic system or socialism. Ranković said: "We were forced to implement some measures to abolish capitalism, purely due to the pressure of the working masses in the country. Secondly, the situation in Eastern Europe after the war made it impossible for Tito not to deal with the Soviet Union."

Ranković said that from the beginning they had taken care not to let revolutionary elements take up important positions, but to concentrate all power in Tito's hands. Therefore, the People's Front was established on the basis of nationalism. Therefore, the Communist Party merged with the People's Front.

Rajk continued to confess the Tito group's plans that Ranković explained to him. In all the people's democracies that had defeated the right-wing elements and been established, Yugoslavia must take on the task of overthrowing the democratic system. But this could not be done openly, because the peoples of Yugoslavia and the people's democracies sincerely adhered to the position of being friendly to the Soviet Union. This meant that the work had to be carried out secretly. Fraudulent and lying propaganda must be engaged in. The prestige of the Yugoslav people among the people of other countries must be used. All kinds of Balkan alliances, with their center in Yugoslavia, must be established, while at the same time continuing to pretend to have a policy of being friendly to the Soviet Union and a policy of establishing socialism.

Ranković told Rajk that Tito emphasized that while concluding bilateral treaties, measures must be taken to weaken the Soviet Union's prestige among the democrats, while raising that of Tito.

The Chief Magistrate asked: Did you accept this task in Hungary?

The defendant replied: Yes. They called it Tito's special plan, which involved not only Hungary, but also all the people's democracies. Ranković said that Tito had taken into account the different conditions in each different country. He only told me about the plans concerning Hungary in detail.

		Plotting to Assassinate Hungarian Government Leaders; Intensifying Slander to Weaken the Prestige of the Soviet Union

The Chief Magistrate asked: What were the tasks you received to deal with the Hungarian politicians?

The defendant replied: The essence of the task was that the Hungarian people's democratic system had to be changed, government commissioners had to be arrested, and the most dangerous people had to be eliminated. On this point, Ranković pointed out the names of Rákosi, Farkas, and Gerő.

The Chief Magistrate asked: Were you promised military assistance from Yugoslavia?

The defendant replied: Ranković promised to give me this support, but emphasized that I must gain support in my work from internal forces.

Rajk further confessed that when he met with the US Ambassador to Hungary, Chapin, he had told the latter that Ranković hoped that the United States could divert the Soviet Union's attention to events in Hungary if necessary. After some hesitation, Chapin declared that he knew about this plan. The defendant said that this made me believe that Tito had informed the United States of his plan, and may even have formulated it in conjunction with them. Rajk confessed that he had given the defendant Korondy the task of forming a special police brigade among the anti-democratic elements, to be used to arrest government commissioners.

He said that after the resolution of the Cominform was announced, Brankov immediately informed him that Ranković wanted to arrange a meeting. This meeting was held at a manor near Bácsalmás, not far from the Hungarian border. The defendant Pálffy, a lieutenant general, ensured that Ranković crossed the border. Rajk was led to the meeting by the then Yugoslav Ambassador to Hungary, Mrázović, who served as an interpreter during the talks. The defendant confessed: At this meeting, Ranković told me that the Cominform resolution could not change the ultimate goal of our plan; however, we needed to change the methods and means of achieving this plan. Circumstances forced us to take a more resolute attitude. We currently have three tasks: First, to turn the Yugoslav people against the Soviet Union; second, to unite the anti-Soviet forces and make the reactionary forces in the people's democracies ready to act; third, to use the increasingly acute contradictions between the Soviet Union and the United States, and to overthrow the government by force at the appropriate time. Ranković said: Turning to an open anti-Soviet policy will take some time. Tito has come up with a "brilliant" plan. Đilas, Kardelj, and Ranković also fully agreed with this plan. The gist of this plan is: To begin with, to criticize the Cominform resolution in a friendly manner, while praising the Soviet Union. Then to discredit the Cominform resolution, saying that it is defamatory, while still not taking any actions that are hostile to the Soviet Union. Then to blame the Soviet Union for obstructing Yugoslavia's construction of socialism, thereby explaining why Tito was forced to request economic assistance from the United States.

The defendant said: Ranković told me that in this propaganda campaign, Tito was counting on the support of Western countries. He said: Our task is to strengthen this propaganda. But currently the main thing is not just propaganda, but also to unite all anti-Soviet forces, even including fascists, because the people's democratic system may become more solid, so everything that can be used must be thrown into the struggle. Support must be sought from the dismissed fascist officers, from people like the former Minister of Defense, Vörös.

		Ultimate Despicable Goal:
		Fantasizing About Overthrowing the Democratic Systems of Eastern Europe and Restoring the Criminal System of Capitalism

The defendant said: Ranković wanted me to pay attention to the need to attract the rich peasants to our side. He asserted that, according to Tito's opinion, after the publication of the Cominform resolution, there was no way to change the democratic system other than by force, and that success could only be expected through an armed coup. Ranković said: Tito was ready to immediately allocate me a considerable number of Yugoslav armed forces to be used to overthrow the Hungarian government. Yugoslavia promised to make a special army composed of Yugoslav-Hungarian people ready for action, and they would be stationed on the border at that time. He told me: The leaders of the Hungarian state must be eliminated by methods that do not superficially resemble assassination. The question also concerned the support of his treasonous conspiracy by military organizations composed of former Horthy soldiers, Hungarian gendarmes, etc., stationed in the Western occupation zone of Austria. Furthermore, various measures were taken to establish contact with the commanders of these military organizations, with the aim of sending these troops through Yugoslavia to Hungary, because the Soviet occupation zone of Austria was separated in their direct passage. Rajk said that Tito began to implement his plan at the end of 1948.

Rajk confessed that because Tito did not express any doubt that he would win, he made concrete demands. He demanded that after the coup, Pálffy be appointed Minister of Defense, and Rób, Minister of Interior. On the issue of foreign policy, Hungary was to obey Yugoslavia. The Hungarian economy was also to be subordinate to the Yugoslav economy.

The defendant claimed that the consolidation of the Hungarian people's unity, and their unity around the Hungarian Workers' Party, deeply frightened Tito and Ranković, and they constantly urged their Hungarian spies to intensify their activities even further.

As Rajk said, when the defendant Rajk notified Tito through his liaison that, in the changed circumstances, it was no longer possible to hold an armed coup in Hungary, Tito's reply was that he had no intention of changing his plan. Rajk said that Brankov was ordered to "transfer" to the side of the Cominform in order to stay in Hungary to help my activities.

Rajk then spoke about what Brankov had said, that Tito and his group were not only trying to intervene in Hungary, but also in Poland, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, and Albania. The defendant said that their ultimate goal was to overthrow the democratic systems of these countries, and to restore the capitalist system.

Near the end of the trial, the Chief Magistrate asked Rajk: Your grandfather's surname was Lech, why did you change Lech to Rajk? The defendant replied: I am an Aryan. I changed my surname when I was a student.

This further clarified a specific matter. It exposed that Rajk, who had consistently posed as a "pure" Hungarian, was originally German. The trial ended here, and the court adjourned.

　　提高警惕粉碎帝国主义间谍活动
  　拉伊克供出叛国罪状         
    美帝及铁托集团奸谋可耻失败
    【新华社讯】据塔斯社布达佩斯讯：匈牙利十六日公开审讯国事犯拉伊克及其同谋者。起诉书由布达佩斯首席检察官亚拉庇·齐犹拉提出。到场约有匈牙利各人民团体和外国公使馆的代表三百名。匈牙利和外国新闻界也派有代表列席。
    上午，审讯以宣读匈牙利检察官的起诉书开始。
    随后便审问主犯——曾先后担任匈牙利内政部长、和外交部长的拉兹洛·拉伊克。
    在回答首席推事的问题时，拉伊克对所犯一切罪状都供认不讳。拉伊克供称：一九三○年从法国（他在那儿接受了左翼运动的思想）回国后，为冒险的动机所迫使，他曾和匈牙利的左翼革命学生运动建立了联系。他于一九三一年被捕。他的亲戚——拉约斯·鲍科尔，他在霍尔梯的政治警察机关工作并且深知拉伊克其人，把他介绍给警察厅政治处处长赫提尼，赫提尼对他说：假如他在悔过书上签字，声明他甘愿和警察合作并在革命运动中从事间谍工作，他便会立刻获释。于是，那时有托洛斯基观点的拉伊克便欣然同意在这样的悔过书上签了字。在从警察机关接受了第一个任务之后，拉伊克即混入大学革命青年学生的行列里。一九三二年，由于他的告密，有十七人被捕，而且为了不暴露拉伊克的奸细面目，警察把他也加以逮捕，但很快便把他释放。被捕者当中有卡罗利·奥尔特，鸠拉·邵普夫林及其他等人。
    他作了一件又一件的卑鄙勾当，而革命青年最优秀的领袖便成了这些勾当的牺牲者。一九三四年，费伦克·罗萨，安德尔·卡尔曼，艾尔齐布特·柯兹玛及其他等人，都由于间谍和奸细拉伊克的原故而成了牺牲者，他那时已转入了共产党布达佩斯地下宣传和鼓动中心的行列中。为了掩饰起见，拉伊克再度被捕，但在法庭审讯开始之前，他就已获释。
    首席推事问他：你向警察告密过多少次？
    　　　　和政治警察联系
    　　陷害匈共革命领袖　告发罢工组织者姓名
    被告答：总数我记不清了。我按时向警察机关报告我所知道的革命领袖和他们的工作。
    拉伊克继描述他如何除了供给警察机关以情报之外，还用尽种种办法协助它瓦解共产党的地下运动。
    一九三四年，匈牙利开始了强烈的法西斯化。同时，也采取了使工会法西斯化和使工会成为墨索里尼工会的方针。匈牙利劳动人民群众对这进行了坚决的斗争，情况愈来愈紧张。到了一九三五年底，爆发事变的不可避免性已经明明白白地感觉得到。这时候，拉伊克奉霍尔梯秘密警察之命，转到建筑工人工会中工作。在听到建筑工人计划举行总罢工之后，拉伊克便将此次罢工组织者的姓名——共产党员安塔尔·阿普罗，伊姆勒·比卡与其他等人告诉了秘密警察，后来并奉他主子的训令为了进行奸细活动起见组织了建筑工人的游行示威。警察逮捕了在建筑工人中活动的、共产党运动的领袖，拉伊克事前已把他们的姓名报告了警察机关。拉伊克他自己则设法“失踪”了。间谍和奸细拉伊克的“价钱”便提高了。他已经是与秘密警察首领邵姆波·史威尼泽尔本人接头了。拉伊克被劝告自匈牙利“消失”。他在捷克斯洛伐克出现。依照警察机关的训令，拉伊克要渐渐钻进共产党各地下中心并向匈牙利警察机关报告它们的活动情形。被告称：由于怕被某种错误步骤而完全暴露自己，迫不得已起了共产党员的作用，在捷克斯洛伐克没有特地作任何事情。当在波兹索伊城（布拉的斯拉发）时，拉伊克奉到邵姆波·史威尼泽尔指定的任务，前往西班牙以发现积极参加西班牙人民解放斗争的匈牙利共产党人的姓名，同时尽可能沮丧匈牙利拉科西营（系国际纵队之一部）的队伍。
    　　　　进入西班牙及法国和托洛斯基分子联系
    在西班牙，拉伊克装成曾屡遭匈牙利秘密警察迫害的匈牙利共产党人。这使得他能够成为营的党委会书记。利用他的职位，拉伊克进行了阴谋破坏的托洛斯基的宣传。在厄布罗河决定性战役的前夕，他诬告营政治委员拉兹洛·哈斯，从而在营的内部散布不和并降低其战斗能力。拉伊克后来受到揭露并被开除出党。
    拉伊克供认：随后，他脱离了争取西班牙人民自由的战士行列，非法越过法国边境，并被拘留于法国。一批南斯拉夫托洛斯基分子在国际集中营中积极活动。拉伊克说：他与这些南斯拉夫托洛斯基分子建立了密切的联系，并与他们肩并肩地进行阴谋破坏的活动。被告说：在居尔营中，我被法国“第二局”军官召见并被要求供给他关于集中营内人们情况的情报。他从桌子的抽屉中取出一份充满着南斯拉夫人姓名的名单，并核对我所提到的名字。我知道他也认为他们是托洛斯基集团的首领。他于是告诉我说，他知道这一集团的活动。后来，我常常在“第二局”的办公厅会见这些南斯拉夫人，且他们也象我一样按照这位军官的训令而行动，这对我是清楚的。
    根据拉伊克的供词，他一直到一九四一年为止，都在法国的集中营内。同年春天，德国委员会前来集中营招募劳动力。该委员会由一位秘密警察少校率领，拉伊克已想不起他的名字了。这位少校传见了拉伊克并向拉伊克建议，要拉伊克到德国去，从那里他就会得到帮助进入匈牙利。秘密警察少校告诉拉伊克说：他是应匈牙利秘密警察官员彼特·哈因底请求而帮助拉伊克。该少校同时并告拉伊克说，他关心集中营内一些南斯拉夫人。他向拉伊克拿出一份就是拉伊克从前在法国谍报机关的军官手上所看见的那份名单。
    拉伊克进而供认：当时与拉伊克同在一集中营的约一百五十名南斯拉夫人，要求这个秘密警察少校帮助他们返回南斯拉夫。被告称：我把这些南斯拉夫人托洛斯基活动的代表告诉了秘密警察。他听到我对后者描述的情形，感到满意，并且说他愿意执行这些南斯拉夫人的请求。
    这一群南斯拉夫人也与拉伊克一同去德国。
    拉伊克指出：我没有确切知道这些南斯拉夫人对于当时南斯拉夫政府的态度怎样。从秘密警察的观点来看，他们是完全可靠的人。
    被告供认：伊姆拉·纪尔用和他一样的方式回到了匈牙利。拉伊克说：“他的社会观与我的政治见解毫无不同之处。还是在法国的时候，我便有了这种确信。”
    　　　　受德秘密警察之助回匈
    　　继续钻入了共产党作破坏革命的奸细
    拉伊克一回到匈牙利，便又渐渐地钻到了共产党地下运动的行列中。他又重新与秘密警察接上了关系，并奉哈因之命使伊姆拉·纪尔打入共产党的一个组织中。被告称：他曾使纪尔与洛·加克斯相晤。在一九四二年，警察逮捕了许多共产党地下运动的领袖。后来我听说这主要是纪尔活动的结果。奸细活动结果使罗萨与舍恩赫兹被捕。
    共产党地下运动的领袖之一罗萨在受秘密警察审讯时，曾受酷刑拷打至死。舍恩赫兹则被吊死。因为拉伊克的姓名也曾在法庭上出现，所以他也同样被捕，但仅被判处六个月徒刑。
    拉伊克一经释放便继续其在共产党地下运动行列中的奸细活动。据被告供称，一九四四年匈牙利军事谍报机关不知道他是警察特务，曾逮捕了他。这是在查拉绥充当政府首领的时候发生的。他被交付军法审判。拉伊克说：我恐怕被判处严刑，甚或是死罪。有秘密审讯时，我讲出了我怎样自一九三一年便忠心耿耿地服务于秘密警察，我要求传我的兄弟安德尔·拉伊克和我的首长邵姆波·史威尼泽尔作证。
    拉伊克的案件于是便转到民事法庭。但后来鉴于苏军的挺进，他便与其他囚犯一同被解往德国。与拉伊克同时被捕的，匈牙利解放运动领袖们（巴伊西—齐林茨基及其他等人），或遭枪毙或被判处长时期的监禁。
    拉伊克之延迟释放，有两重目的：第一、免得在地下运动分子的眼前暴露拉伊克的面目而妨碍其名声；第二、把拉伊克装成是未因其表面上的“共产党”活动而被处死，非常侥幸地脱逃了的人。
    被告进而说出他在德国如何要求斯托普利（他和拉伊克本人一样也是间谍和奸细，而且意欲设法前往美占区）在美占区找邵姆波·史威尼泽尔，并告诉邵姆波·史威尼泽尔说，他—拉伊克即将返回匈牙利。
    　　　　钻进匈共领导机构
    　　受美帝谍报机关训令阴谋推翻人民民主制度
    被告供称：当我回到布达佩斯时，匈牙利共产党业已合法地进行活动。共产党领导机构不知道我与秘密警察的联系。我被看成卓越的党员之一。
    利用这一环境，老奸巨滑的间谍与奸细拉伊克便顽强地逐渐钻到党的领导机构里面。他被任命为大布达佩斯的党组织的书记。不久，盟国管制委员会所属美国军事代表团人员科瓦克中校就访见了拉伊克。他告诉拉伊克说：美占区的邵姆波·史威尼泽尔曾告诉他说拉伊克曾与匈牙利警察勾结过；他并建议拉伊克为美国谍报机关工作。拉伊克接受了这个建议；就象他在法庭上的供辞中所说的，拉伊克曾把若干重要的秘密文件交给美国谍报机关。
    拉伊克说：当我告诉科瓦克说，托洛斯基分子和某些匈牙利政党的右翼集团正在工厂和机关进行反苏活动且正为着使其一伙人被委任到领导职位而进行积极的斗争时，科瓦克告诉我说，他知道此事而且这是在美国知晓的情况下进行的。
    从这时候起，拉伊克便开始为他的新主子—美帝国主义者热心地效力了。
    遵照美国谍报机关的命令，拉伊克曾竭力试图削弱为匈牙利最广大的人民群众所支持的匈牙利共产党的力量。拉伊克声称：“我们的目标就是在国内使资本主义复辟。”
    拉伊克在法庭详述他危害匈牙利人民的活动，详述他和前任美国驻匈牙利公使查平的间谍瓜葛；并且又详述当他盘踞着匈牙利内政部长的位置时，他是怎样地遵照着美国谍报机关的训令来在部里安插那些他晓得他们是为英美谍报机关服务的人。
    拉伊克供称：在一九四六年初，科瓦克使拉伊克与佐恩尼联系，后者被拉伊克利用来使他的人得以盘踞要津，以便随后可利用这些人去实现他这个罪犯的最终目的——推翻民主政府和人民民主制度。
    拉伊克说：在一九四六年初，科瓦克使我和另一个美国谍报机关的代理人马顿·希姆勒联系，他是作为匈牙利战犯的护送人而来匈牙利的。希姆勒一直劝告他纠合共产党内反对苏联的民族主义分子，建立集团，并从而瓦解匈牙利人民的力量。在一九四六年秋季，希姆勒说：今后他将不与拉伊克保持联系，因为将来这种联系将通过南斯拉夫人而继续下去。
    被告说：他没有突然把他的人安置在领导职位上去。拉伊克声称：这是在相当时间之后才遵照铁托和兰科维奇的指令而实现的。这是与美国人所追随的同一的路线，因为铁托和兰科维奇的工作是与美国谍报机关密相吻合的。我手头有好些事实可证明这种联系。我晓得南斯拉夫的许多出名的政治家都是从法国集中营里招募来的秘密警察的特务。一九四五年，美国主要是通过南斯拉夫而派他们的人到匈牙利来的，南斯拉夫领袖们都晓得这些人是美国的特务。当我和兰科维奇在一九四七年夏相会时，我便特别明了南斯拉夫领袖——铁托、兰科维奇及其他等人——和美国谍报机关之间的这种联系。
    　　　　美帝通过南斯拉夫派间谍到匈牙利
    　　拉伊克受铁托集团指挥
    在回答首席推事的问题时，被告供称：尽管他已与美国谍报机关勾结，他还是于一九四五年和南斯拉夫谍报机关的代表建立了联系，那时他仍不知铁托、兰科维奇以及他们的同谋实际上为何等人。拉伊克说：他在一九四五年结识了被告布兰科夫，且后来当拉伊克任内政部长时，布兰科夫时常访问他。在他们的会晤中布兰科夫曾试探拉伊克，并告诉他关于铁托的政策。
    拉伊克说：从我的答复中布兰科夫了解我赞同铁托所奉行的民族主义的而本质上是反苏的政策。后来他坦白地告诉我，他是南斯拉夫在匈牙利的谍报机关的指挥者，并请求我供给他有关国内政治情势的具有秘密性质的各种情报。
    布兰科夫向我转达了南斯拉夫托洛斯基分子的问候，这些托洛斯基分子就是我在法国集中营所结识的。目前他们全都高踞南斯拉夫国家重要的职位。
    被告进一步供认：当他在南斯拉夫度假的时候，由于他与南斯拉夫谍报机关的“友善关系”，他如何在那儿受到很大尊敬与感谢。
    　　　　托洛斯基分子
    　　高踞南斯拉夫领导职位与美谍报机关保持联系
    被告说：当我在南斯拉夫逗留期间，我才完全明白托洛斯基分子在南斯拉夫均高踞领导职位，并且他们均与美国谍报机关保持联系，不仅兰科维奇、德热拉斯、及其朋友们，而且连铁托本人也和美国谍报机关有联系。
    拉伊克详细地描述那时候他与兰科维奇所举行的秘密会谈。在这次会谈中，兰科维奇告诉拉伊克说，假使他不进行合作来实现铁托自己所订下的目的，那么他（拉伊克）将会在匈牙利共产党面前被揭发。
    被告说：我在回答他的话中，告诉他这些威胁是达不到目的的。假使我与他们合作，那倒不是因为我害怕，而是因为我的见解与他们的见解相吻合。
    兰科维奇随后向我拿出我在一九三一年所签署的愿为匈牙利秘密警察工作的誓词的摄影本。他说他是从美国人那里得到这文件的，因为霍尔梯的档案已被由匈牙利运到西方。我很想知道为何美国人会给他这个文件。兰科维奇回答说：没有必要向我隐瞒这一真象，即铁托集团与美国人有着密切的联系。兰科维奇强调说：因此我（指拉伊克）将会经由铁托与兰科维奇而接获美国人给我的一切指令。
    拉伊克说，我相信很久以前铁托、兰科维奇及其集团就已与美国人建立了联系。在短时期内要做到这样密切的合作是不可能的。在我看来，很久以前铁托就已经为美国人所雇用，而且显然地，他们曾经利用了一些不利于他的声誉的事实。
    　　　　窃取机密文件送交铁托　利用职权释放外国间谍
    被告供称，他曾经把有关国家机密的若干文件交给南斯拉夫的间谍。拉伊克说，在他和兰科维奇会晤之后，遵照兰科维奇的指令，他便加紧活动，以把托洛斯基分子、民族主义分子和其他反人民分子安插在较重要的负责的职位上。
    兰科维奇命令拉伊克帮助巴兰科维奇和费菲尔的党在一九四七年议会选举中获胜。作为内政部长的拉伊克对该两党所进行的宣传予以种种帮助。
    被告接受了兰科维奇的指令，就是利用他在共产党中央委员会的地位，使党的领导机构相信不可能同时在两个战线上进行斗争——既反对国内的亲法西斯的各右翼政党，又反对右翼社会民主党人，这样来支持右翼社会民主党人。
    执行英美谍报机关的南斯拉夫特务所发出的这些和后来的指令，拉伊克便解散了警察部队中的共产党组织，而且开始建立反民主的武装队伍，把他们看成是推翻民主政府的支柱。
    在接到了经由布兰科夫（他是拉伊克与兰科维奇及铁托之间的联系人）交给他的指令之后，拉伊克便在需要卫护铁托（那时他要到匈牙利签订友好条约）的借口下，实际上出动了全部警察，来为这个美国特务组织一个可以强调他的特别高级的地位的一种欢迎。政府曾禁止拉伊克为欢迎铁托而采取某些过分的措施，但是他仍使整个布达佩斯盛装起来。
    被告承认他以匈牙利工人党政治局委员的资格得悉共产党情报局决议的内容之后，便在该决议尚未发表之前通知了被告布兰科夫。拉伊克举出外国谍报机关若干特务的姓名，这些人是他利用他先后担任的内政部长和外交部长的官职，使其窃居国家重要机关的领导职位的。他也供认他曾帮助若干被揭露了的法西斯重要领袖逃出国外。拉伊克利用他的地位竭尽其权力所及的一切力量使当时被监禁的外国间谍、托洛斯基分子和民族主义者获释。
    　　　　受美帝及南国间谍指使阴谋破坏东欧对苏友谊
    在回答首席推事的问题时，被告曾详细叙述他和兰科维奇在打猎会之后会晤的情况，这一打猎会是拉伊克在凯利比亚火车站附近为铁托布置的。被告说：在我们会谈时兰科维奇曾告诉我说，必须推翻各人民民主国家的政府、阻止这些国家建立社会主义并使这些国家与苏联分离。必须恢复资产阶级民主的政府，采取发展资本主义的路线。兰科维奇说，这些政府须以美国为方向。这样创立一个以南斯拉夫为首的联盟，它将得到美国的支持。这个联盟将充军事进攻苏联的基地。我告诉他我不了解铁托想用什么方法来执行这个政策，因为南斯拉夫的情形与它的领袖们的计划之间有某些矛盾的地方。兰科维奇回答说，自该国解放以来，无论铁托或整个南斯拉夫政府都未曾谋求建立人民民主制度或社会主义。兰科维奇说：“我们被迫实施某些废除资本主义的措施，纯粹是由于国内劳动大众的压力。其次，战后东欧的形势使得铁托不能不应付苏联。”
    兰科维奇说，从一开始他们就注意到不让革命分子走上重要位置，而把整个权力集中于铁托之手。因此就在民族主义的基础上建立了人民阵线。因此共产党就与人民阵线合并。
    拉伊克继续供认兰科维奇解释给他听的铁托集团的计划。在所有击败了右翼分子而成立的人民民主国家中，南斯拉夫必须担当推翻民主制度的任务。但这不能公开地干，因为南斯拉夫和人民民主国家的人民都真诚地坚持对苏友好的立场。这就是说工作必须秘密地进行。必须从事欺诈的说谎宣传。必须利用南斯拉夫人民在其他国家人民中的声望，必须建立各种各样的巴尔干联盟，其中心设在南斯拉夫，而同时，继续伪装对苏友好的政策及建立社会主义的政策。
    兰科维奇告诉拉伊克说，铁托强调，与订立双边条约同时，必须采取措施削弱苏联在民主分子中的威望，而同时提高铁托。
    首席推事问：你接受了在匈牙利的这一任务吗？
    被告答称：是的。他们把它叫做铁托的特别计划，它不仅涉及匈牙利，而且包括一切人民民主国家，兰科维奇说铁托考虑到了各个不同国家的不同条件。他只详细告诉我了有关匈牙利的计划。
    　　　　图谋刺杀匈国政府领袖　加紧毁谤削弱苏联威望
    首席推事问道：你所接到的对付匈牙利政治家的任务是什么呢？
    被告回答说：任务的实质就是匈牙利的人民民主制度必须改变，政府委员必须被逮捕，而最危险的人必须予以消灭。在这一点上，兰科维奇指出了拉科西、法卡斯和格罗的名字。
    首席推事问道：你曾被诺许得到南斯拉夫的军事援助吗？
    被告答称：兰科维奇答应给我这种支持，但是强调我在我的工作中必须从内部力量中获取支持。
    拉伊克进一步供称，当他与美国驻匈牙利公使查平会面时，他曾告诉后者说，兰科维奇希望在必要时美国能转移苏联对匈牙利事件的注意。经过某些踌躇后，查平宣称，他知道这一计划。被告说，这使我相信铁托已将他的计划告知美国，而且还可能是与他们联合制定的。拉伊克供称，他曾给被告科隆第以任务，在反民主分子中组成特别的警察大队，俾用来逮捕政府委员。
    他说，在共产党情报局的决议公布后，布兰科夫即通知他说，兰科维奇想布置一次会面。这次会议在距匈牙利边境不远的巴克斯城附近的庄园里举行。被告巴尔费中将保证兰科维奇通过边境。拉伊克由那时的南驻匈公使姆拉佐维奇引领赴会，后者在会谈中充任翻译。被告供称：在这次会面中，兰科维奇告诉我说：情报局的决议并不能改变我们计划的最终目的，然而，我们却需要改变实现此计划的方法与手段。环境迫得我们采取更坚决的态度。我们当前有三个任务：一、使南斯拉夫人民反对苏联，二、纠合反苏力量并使人民民主国家里的反动力量准备行动，三、利用苏联与美国之间日益尖锐的矛盾，并在适当的时机以武力推翻政府。兰科维奇说：转到露骨的反苏政策，需要若干时间。铁托已想出了一个“辉煌的”计划。德热拉斯、卡德尔和兰科维奇也完全同意这个计划。这计划的要旨就是：开始时，友好地批评情报局的决议，而同时赞颂苏联。接着就诋毁情报局的决议，说它是毁谤性的，然而，却仍然不采取与苏联为敌的行径。然后再责备苏联阻挠南斯拉夫建设社会主义，从而解释为什么铁托被迫向美国请求经济援助。
    被告说：兰科维奇告诉我说：在这一宣传运动中，铁托指望着西方国家的支持。他说：我们的任务就是加强这种宣传。但目前主要的不光是宣传，而且还要纠合一切反苏的力量，甚至包括法西斯分子在内，因为人民民主制度可能变得更牢固，所以每一件可资利用的东西都必须投到斗争中去。必须从被撤职的法西斯军官当中寻求支持，从前任国防部长维里斯这一类人当中寻求支持。
    　　　　最终卑鄙目的：
    　　妄想推翻东欧民主制度恢复资本主义罪恶制度
    被告说：兰科维奇要我注意把富农吸引到我们这一边来的需要。他力称：照铁托的意见，在情报局决议发表之后，要改变民主制度，舍武力方式外别无他途，而且只有经由武装政变才能期望成功。兰科维奇说：铁托已准备立刻拨给我相当数目的南斯拉夫武装力量，以供推翻匈牙利政府之用。南斯拉夫答应使南斯拉夫借匈牙利人所组成的特别军队整装待发，届时他们便会驻在边境。他对我说：必须用外表上不类似行刺的这一类方法来干掉匈牙利国家的领袖们。问题也关涉到驻在奥地利西占区的由前霍尔梯军人、匈牙利宪兵等等组成的军事组织支持他的叛国阴谋。而且采取种种措施来建立与这些军事组织的指挥官的联系，目的是把这些部队经由南斯拉夫派遣到匈牙利去，因为在他们的直接通路上隔着奥境苏占区。拉伊克说，铁托就在一九四八年底开始实行了他的计划。
    拉伊克供称，因为铁托对于他将赢得胜利一点不表怀疑，故他提出了具体要求。他要求在政变之后，任命巴尔费为国防部长，罗勃为内政部长。在外交政策问题上，匈牙利要服从南斯拉夫。匈牙利的经济也要隶属于南斯拉夫的经济。
    被告称，匈牙利人民团结的巩固以及他们之团结在匈牙利工人党周围，使铁托和兰科维奇深为惊恐，他们不断催促他们的匈牙利间谍要他们更加紧活动。
    正如拉伊克所说的，当被告拉伊克经由他的联络人通知铁托说，在已经改变了的情况下，已不可能在匈国举行武装政变时，铁托的答复是，他无意改变他的计划。拉伊克说，布兰科夫被命令“转到”共产党情报局方面，以便留在匈牙利帮助我的活动。
    拉伊克继乃谈及布兰科夫所说过的话，即铁托及其集团不仅力图干预匈牙利、而且还要干预波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、保加利亚和阿尔巴尼亚。被告说，他们所追求的最终目的就是推翻这些国家的民主制度，和恢复资本主义制度。
    在审讯快终了时，首席推事问拉伊克说：你祖父的姓是莱赫，你为何把莱赫改成拉伊克呢？被告答道：我是阿利安人。我在学生时代便改了姓。
    这一来，又弄清楚了一件具体的事情。它暴露了那一贯冒充“纯”匈牙利人的拉伊克原来是德国人。审讯至此结束，法庭宣告休庭。
