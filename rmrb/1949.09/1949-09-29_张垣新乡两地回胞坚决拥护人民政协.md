　　【Chahar News】The Hui people in Zhangjiakou were extremely excited when they heard the news of the opening of the People's Political Consultative Conference and Chairman Mao's opening speech, and expressed their determination to support it with practical actions. When the news spread to the Hui people who were praying in the mosque, it immediately sparked a wave of support. Sha Youliang, Imam of the Tu'ergou Mosque, said, "I saw that there are three Hui representatives and one alternate representative on the list of representatives of the People's Political Consultative Conference, which is really a dream come true!" Yang Dengshan, a Hui worker in the riveting furnace workshop of the Zhangjiakou Railway Machinery Factory, said, "We all ethnic groups must unite under the leadership of the Central People's Government to build a new China. We must step up production to support the front lines, save raw materials, and overcome difficulties. Don't think that American imperialism has money; we don't need him. We must learn from the Soviet Union's experience in nation-building. Now, we work an extra hour every day and prepare to complete the task of 4,000 splints ahead of schedule." Li Yingxuan, principal of the No. 17 Elementary School in District 1 and a Hui person, said, "Three different periods (referring to the Kuomintang, the Japanese puppet regime, and after liberation) gave me a valuable experience: only under the leadership of the Communist Party can minority ethnic groups be liberated."
　　【Xinxiang Telegram】The news of the opening of the People's Political Consultative Conference has inspired the farmers and Hui people in the city who have just been liberated. When people recalled the miserable life during the Kuomintang rule, they said: In 1947, one mu of land had to produce 530 jin of grain. If they couldn't afford it, they would be tied up, beaten, and have their homes ransacked, and the young and strong were forced to become soldiers, leaving women and the elderly with only the option of begging. But the landlords colluded with the "government" and did not pay a single grain. The Hui people of Xinxiang City gritted their teeth and hated the Kuomintang even more, saying: Zhao Dapupu, the Kuomintang commissioner of Xinxiang, forcibly extorted the mosque's house, and the bandit troops cooked large pieces of meat in the pot used for cooking in the mosque. The Hui compatriots harbor irreconcilable hatred in their hearts. Hui representative Yang Yaozu earnestly requested the newspaper to send a telegram to Chairman Mao and the representatives of the People's Political Consultative Conference: The Hui people of Xinxiang will firmly implement all the decrees of the Central People's Government and are prepared to establish a Hui production cooperative and a Hui elementary school, actively produce, improve culture, and support the People's Liberation Army to liberate all of China.

　　张垣新乡两地回胞坚决拥护人民政协
    【察哈尔讯】张家口回民当听到人民政协开幕的消息和毛主席的开幕词后，异常兴奋，咸表示要以实际行动来拥护它。消息传到正在清真寺做礼拜的回民群众中后，立即发出了一片拥护的议论。土尔沟清真寺教长沙幼良说：“我在人民政协各单位代表名单上，看见有我们回民代表三名，候补代表一名，这真是梦想不到的喜事！”张家口铁路机厂铆炉房回民工人杨登山说：“我们各民族要团结起来在中央人民政府领导下建设新中国。我们要加紧生产支援前线，要节省原料，克服困难。别看美帝国主义有钱，我们用不着他。我们要学习苏联建国的经验。现在，我们每天加工一个钟头，准备提前完成四千块夹板的任务。”一区十七街初小校长，回民李应选说：“三个不同时期（指国民党、日伪统治时期及解放后）给了我一个宝贵的经验：只有在共产党领导之下，少数民族才能解放。”
    【新乡电】人民政治协商会议开幕的消息振奋了此间刚获解放不久的农民和全市回民。人们回忆到国民党统治时期的悲惨生活时说：一九四七年一亩地要出五百三十斤粮食，出不起，又捆又打还抄家，并把青壮年硬拉去当兵，妇女老人只有要饭一条路。可是地主们却和“官府”勾结，一粮不拿。新乡市回民更咬牙切齿痛恨地说：国民党新乡专员赵大浦把清真寺的房子硬给讹诈了去，匪军们则在清真寺做饭的锅里煮大肉。回胞们蕴藏在内心里真有不共戴天的仇恨。回民代表杨耀祖更恳切的要求报社打电报给毛主席及人民政协代表：新乡回民一定坚决执行中央人民政府的一切法令，并准备建立回民生产合作社、回民小学，积极生产，提高文化，支援人民解放军解放全中国。
