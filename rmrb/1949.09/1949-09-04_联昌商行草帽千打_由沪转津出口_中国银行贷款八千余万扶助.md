　　Lianchang Trading Company’s Thousand Dozen Straw Hats
  　Transferred from Shanghai to Tianjin for Export
  　Bank of China Provides Loans of Over 80 Million to Assist
    [Tianjin News] In order to shatter the Kuomintang bandit gang’s blockade of Shanghai’s port, with the support of the state bank, some export goods have recently been transferred to Tianjin for export. Lianchang Trading Company, an exporter in Tianjin, has purchased a large quantity of straw hats from Shanghai. The first batch of twenty-seven packages (approximately one thousand dozen) has been transported to Tianjin for sorting and packaging, awaiting shipment. The straw hats handled by this company have always been exported through Shanghai, but because the straw braid's raw materials and labor are all from the north, they are now exported through Tianjin. Since Shanghai was blockaded, the company decided to purchase straw hats from Shanghai and export them through Tianjin. However, due to difficulties in capital turnover, it requested a packing loan from the Bank of China on the 17th of last month through the introduction of the North China Foreign Trade Administration. Under the premise of supporting legitimate export businesses to earn foreign exchange and implementing a counter-blockade against the enemy, the Bank of China granted the company a total of 86.04 million yuan in loans in three installments on the 22nd and 24th of last month.

　　联昌商行草帽千打
  　由沪转津出口
  　中国银行贷款八千余万扶助
    【天津讯】为粉碎国民党匪帮对上海港口之封锁，在国家银行的扶植下，部分出口货物近日已转由天津出口。津市出口商联昌商行，已由沪购进大批草帽，首批二十七包（约一千打左右）已运津整理装包，候轮出口。该行所经营的草帽，一向由上海出口，而草帽辫因原料及人工皆用北方的，故由天津出口。自上海被封锁后，该行即决定由上海购进草帽改由天津出口，但因资金周转困难，故于上月十七日经华北对外贸易管理局介绍，到中国银行请求打包贷款，在扶植正当出口商业争取外汇和对敌人实行反封锁的前提下，中国银行于上月二十二日和二十四日先后三次对该商贷款共计八千六百零四万元。
