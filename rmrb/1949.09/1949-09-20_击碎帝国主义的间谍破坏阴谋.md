　　Smash the Imperialist Conspiracy of Espionage and Sabotage
    In the Hungarian People's Court, faced with the ironclad evidence listed in the prosecutor's indictment, the traitor Rajk confessed to all his crimes. With his own confessions, he painted an extremely ugly portrait of himself. Through it, people were able to recognize more clearly the ugly faces of the Tito clique and even American and British imperialism, greatly increasing the vigilance of the world peace camp against imperialist espionage and sabotage conspiracies.
    Rajk's confession showed that the purpose of the adventurous activities carried out by the imperialists and their hired traitors and spies in the people's democratic countries was to overthrow the people's democratic system and restore the capitalist system. They not only wanted to drag all the people's democratic countries to the side of American imperialism in Hungary, but also wanted them to become objects of exploitation and enslavement by American imperialism, bases for attacking the Soviet Union, and springboards for new wars. Ranković, one of the fascist bosses of the Tito clique, said nakedly in a conversation with Rajk: "Tito has never sought to establish a people's democratic system from the beginning." He attempted to "overthrow the governments of the people's democratic countries, prevent these countries from establishing socialism, and separate these countries from the Soviet Union." Tito's partner in Hungary has confessed to the entire criminal plan jointly formulated by this American spy group and American imperialism.
    They—the likes of Tito and Rajk—used disguise to lurk in the revolutionary camp for a long time. As early as during World War II, the Tito clique established contact with American imperialism; Rajk also gladly participated in espionage work as a Trotskyite since 1931, acting as an accomplice of the then Hungarian reactionary government's police department. Later, he colluded with the German secret police, and then worked for the American intelligence agency, and was introduced by an American spy to contact the Tito spy group, and worked as an international spy for eighteen years. And they have been lurking in the revolutionary camp for a long time, occupying important positions, and using their positions to destroy the people's regime. This makes the people of all people's democratic countries more vigilant so that traitors do not mix into the revolutionary camp!
    Another important means for Rajk and others to sabotage the people's democratic regime was to establish counter-revolutionary armed forces. He confessed that he carried out the instructions of British, American and Yugoslav special agents, disbanded the Communist Party organization in the police force, and had begun to establish anti-democratic armed forces. At the same time, the Tito clique also planned to intervene militarily in Hungary at an appropriate time. This makes the people of all people's democratic countries more aware of the importance of consolidating and strengthening the people's armed forces.
    Rajk also confessed that, under the instructions of the Tito clique, he used fascists, nationalists, and rich peasants as their forces to destroy the people's democratic regime. This has made the people of the people's democratic countries more politically vigilant, and has also educated the people of all countries: the inevitable path of nationalism is to betray the independence and sovereignty of the country.
    Another despicable and vicious means for Rajk and his ilk to undermine the people's democratic regime was to carry out assassinations. The Tito clique taught him various assassination methods, asking him to assassinate Rakosi and other revolutionary leaders most loved by the people, in order to launch a coup and seize power. This makes the people of the world recognize that the Tito clique is an assassination gang. It also makes the people of all countries more love and more vigilantly defend the revolutionary leaders.
    The conspiracy of Rajk and his ilk was finally shattered by the immense power of the people's democratic regime, which was a heavy blow to American and British imperialism and the Tito clique. This is an encouragement to the Hungarian people; because it proves the power of the organized people under the leadership of the Hungarian Workers' Party, and proves the further consolidation of the people's democratic dictatorship in Hungary. This is also an encouragement to the people of Yugoslavia; the South Slav people are strengthening the organized forces against Tito, and we believe that the day when the South Slav people finally judge Tito, Ranković, Djilas and other American spies will eventually come. This is also a great encouragement to the people of all people's democratic countries and to the people of our soon-to-be formally established People's Republic of China; because this makes us more confident that we have the power to defeat all imperialist espionage conspiracies and smash the plan admitted in the American imperialist White Paper to recruit a fifth column in the new China.

### 击碎帝国主义的间谍破坏阴谋

　　击碎帝国主义的间谍破坏阴谋
    在匈牙利人民法庭上，在检察官的起诉书列举的铁的罪证面前，叛贼拉伊克供认了他的一切罪状，以他自己的供词，把他自己那副极其丑恶的尊容描绘了出来。透过它，人们得以更清楚地认清了铁托集团以至美英帝国主义的丑脸，大大提高了世界和平阵营对于帝国主义间谍破坏阴谋的警惕性。
    拉伊克的供词说明了帝国主义者及其雇佣的奸细、间谍在人民民主国家中所进行的冒险活动的目的是想要推翻人民民主制度，恢复资本主义制度。他们不止是在匈牙利，还妄想把所有的人民民主国家拖到美帝国主义方面去，成为美帝国主义剥削奴役的对象，成为进攻苏联的基地，成为新战争的跳板。拉伊克所供述的铁托集团法西斯头目之一兰科维奇和他的一段谈话中赤裸裸地说：“铁托从开始便未曾谋求建立人民民主制度。”妄图“推翻各人民民主国家的政府，阻止这些国家建立社会主义，并使这些国家和苏联分离。”铁托在匈牙利的伙伴，已经把他们这一美国间谍集团和美帝国主义共同制订的全部罪恶计划都招供出来了。
    他们——铁托、拉伊克之辈——用伪装的办法长期潜伏在革命阵营里。早在二次大战期间铁托集团就和美帝国主义建立了联系；拉伊克从一九三一年开始也就以一个托洛斯基分子的身份欣然参加了间谍工作，作当时匈牙利反动政府警察厅的鹰犬，以后又和德国秘密警察勾结，接着就为美国谍报机关工作，又经美国间谍介绍转与铁托间谍集团联系，一直作了十八年国际间谍。而他们都长期潜伏在革命阵营中，僭居要职，利用职务方便，破坏人民政权。这使所有人民民主国家的人民都更警惕，不要使奸细混入革命阵营中来！
    拉伊克等破坏人民民主政权的又一个重要手段是建立反革命的武装。他供认了他执行英美南特务的指令，解散了警察部队中的共产党组织，并已开始建立反民主的武装部队。同时，铁托集团还计划在适当时机武装干涉匈牙利。这使所有人民民主国家的人民都更明白巩固加强人民武装力量的重要性。
    拉伊克还供认，他受铁托集团的指使，把法西斯分子、民族主义分子、富农都作为他们摧毁人民民主政权的力量。这使人民民主国家的人民都更提高了政治警惕性，也又教育了各国人民：民族主义的必然道路是出卖国家的独立主权。
    拉伊克辈又一卑鄙毒辣的破坏人民民主政权的手段是进行暗杀；铁托集团教导他种种暗杀的方法，要他刺杀拉科西等人民所最敬爱的革命领袖，以便发动政变，夺取政权。这使全世界人民认清了铁托集团乃是一个暗杀团。也使各国人民更加爱戴与更加警惕地保卫革命的领袖们。
    拉伊克辈的阴谋终于是被人民民主政权的巨大无比的力量击得粉碎了，这是对美英帝国主义和铁托集团沉重的一击。这对匈牙利人民是一个鼓舞；因为这证明了在匈牙利工人党领导下的有组织的人民的力量，证明了人民民主专政在匈牙利的更加巩固。这对南斯拉夫人民也是个鼓舞；南国人民正在加强反铁托的有组织的力量，我们相信，南斯拉夫人民最后审判铁托、兰科维奇、德热拉斯等一伙美国间谍的日子也终必会到来的。这对各人民民主国家、对我们即将正式成立的中华人民共和国的人民也是一个莫大的鼓舞；因为这使我们更相信我们有力量挫败帝国主义一切间谍的阴谋，击碎美帝白皮书中所供认的要在新中国招募第五纵队的计划。
