　　Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, 23rd: Following the liberation of Tong'an, the People's Liberation Army on the Fujian front has liberated three more cities: Changtai, Nan'jing, and Longxi (Zhangzhou). One unit of the PLA first captured Changtai County, more than 20 miles northeast of Zhangzhou, with a swift action at 6:00 AM on the 19th. Another unit of the PLA simultaneously occupied Nan'jing County, more than 30 miles west of Zhangzhou. The remnant troops of the Kuomintang bandit Liu Ruming, entrenched in Zhangzhou, abandoned the city in panic under the pressure of the PLA and fled towards Haicheng, southeast of Zhangzhou. Zhangzhou was declared liberated at 10:00 PM on the 19th. The PLA is now pursuing the fleeing enemy. Note: Zhangzhou (Longxi) is located on the north bank of the Long River, a key point connecting the inland and coastal areas of southern Fujian. Going down the Long River to the east leads directly to Xiamen, making it a strategically important military location in southern Fujian. The city is densely populated, with convenient transportation, and thriving trade, making it a major city in the southwest of Fujian Province. The sugar industry is the most developed handicraft industry, and the textile industry is also relatively developed, with more than 20 textile workshops. Zhangzhou silk and velvet have long been famous.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, 23rd: In the battle to liberate Tong'an, the People's Liberation Army on the Fujian front annihilated more than 1,500 Kuomintang bandit troops. At dawn on the 19th, the PLA launched an attack on Tong'an, quickly breaking through the enemy's outer defenses. The bandit troops fled in disarray towards Jimei on the north shore of Xiamen Island, where they were divided and surrounded by the PLA's flanking forces. All fleeing enemies were annihilated. Simultaneously with the liberation of Tong'an, another unit of the PLA liberated Jiaowei Town in the northwest corner of Xiamen, capturing more than 200 men from the 355th Regiment of the 119th Division of the Kuomintang bandit army's 68th Corps, and defeating the bandit security 3rd Regiment, which reinforced from Jiaowei Alley, killing and wounding more than 100 bandits, destroying two cars, and seizing a radio station.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northwest Front, 23rd: Zhang Qinwu, the brigade commander of the 1st Cavalry Brigade of Hu Zongnan's bandit troops, who had been roaming in the Jingtai area of northern Gansu, led his remaining 450 men, carrying more than 630 rifles, to surrender to the People's Liberation Army on the 20th.
