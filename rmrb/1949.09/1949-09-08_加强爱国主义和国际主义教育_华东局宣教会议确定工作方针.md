Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 7th: The East China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China held the East China Propaganda and Education Conference in Shanghai from August 22nd to 30th. Those attending included the propaganda ministers of the Shandong and Zhejiang Provincial Committees, the four District Committees of Southern Jiangsu, Northern Jiangsu, Southern Anhui, and Northern Anhui, the Shanghai and Nanjing Municipal Committees, and the Propaganda Department of the Political Department of the Third Field Army of the People's Liberation Army, as well as the heads and directors of education departments and offices in various places, and the presidents of Xinhua branch offices and various newspapers. At the meeting, Comrade Shu Tong, Minister of Propaganda of the East China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, gave a comprehensive report, and Deputy Ministers Feng Ding and Xia Yan gave supplementary reports on education work and propaganda and literary work respectively. After the reports, the attendees were divided into four groups—propaganda and literature, news and communications broadcasting, school education, and bookstore publishing—to conduct discussions separately. Finally, Shu Tong gave a summary report, and Rao Shushi, First Secretary of the East China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Shanghai Municipal Committee concurrently, and Chen Yi, Second Secretary, gave clear instructions on the guiding principles for the Party's propaganda and education work in East China in the future.

In his comprehensive report, Minister Shu Tong pointed out that the propaganda and education work since going south has been successful, with three main points: (1) Ensuring the victory of the troops crossing the river in the front and expanding the political influence of the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army; mobilizing millions of militiamen and laborers to participate in the war in the rear, establishing the idea of combining support for the front with production. (2) Completing the cultural and educational takeover work in a prepared manner, avoiding possible chaos and disconnection; attacking the enemy's cultural positions, but at the same time preserving parts with scientific and artistic value. (3) Universally launching a powerful struggle on the literary and propaganda front, attacking the enemy's ideological positions and expanding our own ideological positions. Minister Shu also pointed out the main shortcomings and deviations in propaganda work, such as: some places being tight at the beginning and loose later, or the methods being rigid in the urban takeover work; in the leadership of propaganda work, generally emphasizing cities and neglecting the countryside, paying attention to key points and neglecting overall consideration. In terms of literary propaganda, the united front was not broad and deep enough, paying attention to advanced classes and neglecting backward classes. The propaganda methods were not flexible enough, and more or less there was a tendency toward generalization and formulaization.

Regarding the tasks and principles of propaganda work in East China in the future, Minister Shu said: First, it is necessary to launch anti-imperialist and anti-feudal propaganda from all aspects, emphasizing the consistency of revolutionary patriotism and internationalism. Emphasize the propaganda of the "leaning to one side" ideology. Propaganda methods must proceed from the existing level of the masses, in accordance with objective and specific conditions, to gradually raise them to the level of the Party's policies. Second, propaganda and education work must powerfully cooperate with the six major tasks proposed by the East China Bureau of smashing the enemy's blockade and building a new Shanghai. Third, the urban takeover work has basically ended, and is now entering a new stage of management, transformation, and construction. Propaganda and literary work and school education work must continue to destroy the enemy's ideological positions, consolidate and expand our ideological positions, and on this basis, gradually strengthen the ideological education and organizational work of the propaganda and education departments, and improve professional standards. At the same time, we must boldly promote and train new cadres. Local cultural troupes and propaganda teams should become schools for training propaganda cadres, and a large number of young intellectuals should be absorbed to participate in various propaganda and education work. In order to accomplish these tasks, Minister Shu emphasized that propaganda work must take into account both urban and rural areas; consolidate and develop the united front on the cultural front, opposing left and right deviations; overcome the problems of generalization and formulaization in propaganda and literary work, constantly engage in new revolutionary creations, and should strengthen the unity and discipline in propaganda work, overcoming the still existing phenomena of disorganization and lack of discipline.

　　加强爱国主义和国际主义教育　华东局宣教会议确定工作方针
    【新华社上海七日电】中共中央华东局八月二十二日至三十日在上海召开华东宣传教育会议。到会山东、浙江两个省委、苏南、苏北、皖南、皖北四个区党委，上海、南京两个市委和人民解放军第三野战军政治部宣传部的宣传部长，各地教育厅长、处长和新华分社、各报社社长等。会上由中共中央华东局宣传部长舒同作综合性报告，副部长冯定和夏衍分别作关于教育工作和宣传文艺工作的补充报告。报告后，出席会议者即分成宣传文艺、新闻通讯广播、学校教育、书店出版等四个组分别进行讨论。最后由舒同作总结报告，并由中共中央华东局兼上海市委第一书记饶漱石、第二书记陈毅对今后华东全党的宣教工作方针作了明确指示。
    舒同部长在他的综合报告中指出：南下以来的宣教工作是有成绩的，主要的有三点：（一）在前方保证部队渡江作战的胜利，扩大了共产党和人民解放军的政治影响；在后方动员了百万民兵、民工参战，树立了支援前线和生产相结合的思想。（二）有准备地完成了文教接管工作，避免了可能引起的混乱和脱节；打击了敌人的文化阵地，但同时保存了有科学及艺术价值的部分。（三）普遍展开了强有力的文艺宣传战线上的斗争，打击了反动思想的阵地，扩大了自己的思想阵地。舒部长也指出宣传工作中的主要缺点和偏向，例如：城市接管工作中某些地方前紧后松或方式生硬；宣传工作的领导上，一般偏重城市而忽略了农村，注意到了重点掌握而忽视了全面照顾。文艺宣传方面，统一战线还不够广泛和深入，注意到先进的阶层忽视了落后的阶层。宣传方式还不够灵活，而且或多或少存在着一般化和公式化的倾向。
    对今后华东宣传工作的任务和方针，舒部长说：第一要从各方面展开反帝反封建的宣传，着重说明革命的爱国主义和国际主义的一致性。强调宣传“一面倒”的思想。宣传方法必须按照客观的具体情况，从群众的现有水平出发，以便逐渐提高到党的政策水平。第二，宣传教育工作必须有力地配合华东局所提出的粉碎敌人封锁建设新上海的六大任务。第三，城市接收工作已经基本结束，目前正转入管理、改造和建设的新阶段。宣传文艺工作和学校教育工作必须继续摧毁敌人的思想阵地，巩固与扩大我们的思想阵地，并在这个基础上逐步强化宣教部门的思想教育和组织工作，提高业务水平。同时要大胆提拔培养新干部，各地文工团、宣传队应当成为培养宣传干部的学校，大量吸收青年知识分子参加各种宣教工作。为了完成这些任务，舒部长强调提出，今后宣传工作必须做到城乡兼顾；巩固并发展文化战线上的统一战线，反对左的和右的偏向；克服宣传文艺工作的一般化、公式化的毛病，不断从事新的革命创造，并应当加强宣传工作中的统一性和纪律性，克服仍然存在的无组织无纪律现象。
