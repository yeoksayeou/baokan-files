　　Unified Management and Rational Use of State Assets
　　State-Owned Enterprises in Northeast China
　　Initially Complete Property Inventory
    [This Dispatch from Our Northeast Correspondent] In order to unify the management of state property, accurately calculate and rationally utilize state funds, and promote economic accounting in various enterprises, state-owned enterprises in Northeast China have, to date, successively and preliminarily completed the inventory, registration, and valuation of property. This includes most factories and mines under the Ministry of Industry, postal and telecommunications, shipping, highway, and railway administrations under the Ministry of Transport (railways and affiliated factories within the prescribed scope), trade agencies under the Ministry of Commerce, the Northeast Bank, and three mechanical farms under the Ministry of Agriculture. Relevant leading organs are now stepping up the work of review and compilation in order to submit them to the Financial and Economic Committee for approval as soon as possible, and then hand them over to the General Accounting Bureau as state revenue. Subsequently, the General Accounting Bureau will allocate the funds to the respective enterprises as state investment, thereby establishing unified state management of enterprise funds, profits, and depreciation. During the property inventory, the Railway Administration, by learning from Soviet methods and experiences, adopting a combination of top-down and bottom-up approaches, promoting democracy, and pooling wisdom, has carried out its work methodically, scientifically, and meticulously.

    【本报东北消息】为统一管理国家财产，精确计算并合理运用国家资金，促进各企业经济核算，东北各国营企业清理财产工作，截至目前，工业部所属大部分厂矿，交通部所属邮电、航务、公路、铁路总局所属依照规定范围的铁道及附属工厂，商业部所属贸易机关，东北银行，以及农业部所属三个机械农场，均已相继初步完成了清点、登记和估价。现各有关领导机关正加紧进行审核和汇编工作，以便及早呈报财经委员会审定后交总会计局作为国家收入，然后按需要经总会计局拨付各该企业具领，作为国家之投资，从而建立国家对企业资金、利润、折旧的统一管理。在清理财产中铁路总局由于学习苏联的方法和经验，采取上下结合，发扬民主，集思广益，工作进行得有步骤且较科学细致。
