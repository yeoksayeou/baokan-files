 Shandong Provincial Grain Bureau Directs Localities to Organize Grain Sunning and Inventory Clearance; Inspection Teams Dispatched to Various Regions to Carry Out Work

[This Paper Reports] Jinan Dispatch: Recently, continuous rainstorms in Shandong have caused the collapse of public grain warehouses in various places, and the public grain has been affected by moisture and mold, resulting in losses to state assets. To this end, the Provincial Grain Bureau has issued an urgent directive to all localities to immediately organize forces to engage in grain sunning. In addition to the provincial government's telegram ordering the speedy implementation by the local administrative offices, the Provincial Grain Bureau's instructions stated in summary: All grain stocks in warehouses in all localities, regardless of new or old wheat and rice, should be thoroughly inspected, either by sunning, or by transfer between warehouses, or by transshipment. Leading cadres at all levels must personally take charge and must not delay or act carelessly in the slightest. Leaky roofs, damp floors, and insecure warehouses should be immediately moved or make minor repairs. In addition, during the grain inspection, attention should be paid to cleaning up warehouse materials, especially the inventory of equipment such as sacks and flour bags, to ensure clear accounts and facilitate work. The directive emphasized in particular that cadres should realize ideologically that this inventory of assets is different from the past, and they should go all out to lay the foundation for convenient payment of current grain in the future.

Furthermore, after the Provincial Grain Bureau issued an emergency directive on grain inspection and material inventory, it specially selected eighteen cadres to form grain inspection teams, which were dispatched to the Lunan, Bohai, Jiaodong, and Changwei administrative offices on August 31st to carry out work.

  　组织晒粮清仓
  　查仓组分赴各地开展工作
    【本报讯】山东消息：最近霪雨连绵，山东各地不断发生公粮仓库倒塌现象，公粮受潮发霉，致使国家资财遭受损失。为此，省粮食局特紧急指示各地，立即组织力量，投入倒晒运动。除省府已电令各地行署迅速执行外，省粮食局指示略称：各地所有仓库存粮，无论新陈麦米，一律进行彻底检查，或曝晒，或倒仓，或转运，各级领导干部必须亲自掌握，丝毫不得拖延，马虎从事。屋漏、地湿及仓房不坚固者，应立即移仓，或作小型修补。另外，在查粮中应注意清理仓房物资，特别是麻袋、面袋等用具的清点工作，做到帐目清白，以利工作。指示最后特别强调：干部应从思想上认识到这次清理资财和过去不同，要全力以赴，打下今后掌握现粮便利支付的基础。
    又：省粮食局发出查粮、清理物资的紧急指示后，特又抽调十八个干部组成查仓组，于上月三十一日分赴鲁中南、渤海、胶东、昌潍等行署进行工作。
