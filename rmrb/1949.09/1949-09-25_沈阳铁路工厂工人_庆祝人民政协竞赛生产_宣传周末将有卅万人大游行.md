　　【Our Correspondent in Shenyang, 23rd Dispatch】"Improve production to celebrate the People's Political Consultative Conference!" The words of Zhang Shuqin, a female worker at the Shenyang Woolen Mill, and Xi ChunKui, a pipe fitter, represent the will of all workers. Their activities are unfolding a bright future for the production and construction of the new China. The four heroes of the No. 13 Machine Factory who created new production records – Zhao Fuyou, Zhao Guoyou, Zhang Shangju, and Dang Huian – wrote in their letter to Chairman Mao after their group meeting: "We guarantee to permanently maintain our spirit of creating new records and improving production tools." Sure enough, three people at the No. 3 Machine Factory created new records yesterday (22nd). Wang Baoshan, a main axle grinding worker, was one of them, increasing his output from one axle in seven hours the day before yesterday (21st) to one axle in five and a half hours. The Shenyang Textile Mill is celebrating the birth of the new China with an unprecedented output of 460匹 per machine (the previous highest being 420匹). The competition committee of the Telecommunications Machine Factory workers, which is currently engaged in a competition, has decided to complete the work plan for the final eight days of the second stage, and also to repair six woodworking machines, install a new large automobile, two 50-line common battery switchboards, and one non-button type switchboard. Shenyang railway attendants held a particularly serious "inspection competition" simulating faults yesterday, and finally demonstrated their support for the People's Political Consultative Conference with the practical action of completing the inspection over the allotted time (disqualification). In an article written by the railway factory workers themselves, entitled "Celebrating the Founding of the Country with a Production Competition," it says: "First, the passenger car, freight car, flatcar, material preparation, and machine repair teams jointly challenged the car assembly, riveters, mechanics, foundry, and forging workshops. The former will complete 40 passenger cars and 100 freight cars. In addition, the machine repair workshop will also dedicate a repaired large bus as a gift, and prepare cold-proof equipment and materials for winter use to meet winter production tasks. The latter should also respond to the challenge by supplying electricity, water, wind, and steam, ensuring that there are no accidents."

　　【Another Dispatch】All of Shenyang is doubly blessed. Yesterday we celebrated the People's Political Consultative Conference, and the day after tomorrow (25th) we will hold the first People's Congress since the liberation of Shenyang ten months ago. The streets are clean and tidy, and red flags are flying. Many trams and pedicabs have slogans written on them, and everyone has a happy face. It is reported that, according to the instructions of the Northeast Bureau, Shenyang City will conduct decentralized propaganda activities, with discussions and studies organized by government departments and schools. On the last day of the Propaganda Week (October 2nd), there will be a grand parade of more than 300,000 people.

    【又电】沈阳全市双喜临门了。昨天庆祝人民政协，后天（二十五）又召开沈市解放十个月以来第一次人代会，街头整洁，红旗飘扬，不少电车、三轮大车，写上标语，人人都呈现出一张喜悦的面容。据悉，沈阳市根据东北局指示，将作分散的宣传活动，以机关学校为单位进行讨论学习。在宣传周结束的那一天（十月二日）将有三十余万人的大游行示威。
