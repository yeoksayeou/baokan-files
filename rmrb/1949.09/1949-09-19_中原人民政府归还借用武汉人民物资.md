Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 18th. The Central Plains People's Government is now beginning to return grain, coal and other materials borrowed from the people of Wuhan when Wuhan was initially liberated in May of this year. When Wuhan was initially liberated, a large number of People's Liberation Army troops gathered in the urban area, and transportation had not yet been restored. The supply of military grain and fuel could not be met for a time. The Financial and Economic Department of the Central Plains People's Government, through the Hankou Chamber of Commerce, borrowed more than 346,000 catties of rice and 600,000 catties of firewood from merchants in Hankou and the original Wuhan Security Committee. In addition, there were flour, coal, soybeans and other items. Now that Wuhan's transportation is smooth and the supply of various materials is abundant, the Central Plains People's Government has ordered the Financial and Economic Department to quickly return the borrowed materials, and has designated the Central China Grain Bureau under its jurisdiction to jointly discuss the return method with the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. The Central Plains People's Government expressed its deep gratitude to the citizens for their enthusiastic help in the early days of Wuhan's liberation.

　　中原人民政府归还借用武汉人民物资
    【新华社汉口十八日电】中原人民政府，现正着手归还今年五月武汉初解放时向人民借用的粮煤等物资。当武汉初解放时，解放军大军云集市区，交通尚未恢复，军粮燃料一时供应不及，曾由中原人民政府财政经济部经汉口市商会，向汉口市各商户及原武汉治安委员会筹借大米三十四万六千余斤，木柴六十万斤，此外尚有面粉、煤炭、黄豆等物。现武汉交通畅通，各种物资供应充裕，因此中原人民政府特命令财政经济部迅速归还借用物资，指定该部所属华中粮食总局与市商会共同商定归还办法，中原人民政府并对武汉解放初期市民的热烈帮助，表示深切感谢。
