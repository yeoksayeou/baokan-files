　　Beijing Public Buses Switch to Package-Responsibility System
　　Efficiency Increases, Breakdowns Decrease
    [Our Newspaper] The publicly operated Beijing Automobile Company has seen improved efficiency and a lower breakdown rate since adopting the package-responsibility system. Before mid-August, the company implemented a rotation system, where drivers were not responsible for the vehicles. If a minor problem occurred on the road, they would call the company for a replacement vehicle and send the original to the repair shop. The repair shop would only fix minor issues superficially. Drivers, in turn, would not thoroughly inspect the vehicle before driving, resulting in breakdowns shortly after being put back into service. When investigating responsibility, drivers blamed the repair shop for inadequate repairs, while the repair shop blamed the drivers for being irresponsible and lacking technical skills. Furthermore, frequent driver changes made it difficult to understand the vehicle's condition and problems, leading to increased breakdowns and difficulty in assigning responsibility. These issues caused significant losses to the company. Therefore, after detailed research and discussion, the company switched to a package-responsibility system on August 20th. Each vehicle was assigned to two drivers and two conductors (assistants), with a designated leader and deputy leader for the morning and evening shifts, respectively. All major, medium, and minor repairs of the vehicle became the sole responsibility of these four individuals. These drivers were all experienced repairmen transferred from the repair shop, and the company appropriately assigned them to vehicles based on their technical expertise, ensuring they could handle the task. As a result, the four individuals were extremely careful and responsible while driving, and they could fix minor problems themselves on the road, reducing the waste of manpower and resources. During the drivers' rest periods, their vehicles also rested, providing an opportunity for inspection and repair. This ensured that both drivers and vehicles could rest in shifts, significantly reducing the occurrence of breakdowns. The company used reserve vehicles as replacements during rest periods, ensuring that operations were not affected. According to statistics from July 20th to August 19th, during the rotation system, each vehicle carried an average of 376 passengers per day, traveled 92.71 kilometers, and had a breakdown rate of 0.73 times. After the implementation of the package-responsibility system from August 20th to September 19th, each vehicle carried an average of 503 passengers per day, traveled 120.17 kilometers, and had a breakdown rate of 0.41 times. This represents an increase of 127 passengers per vehicle per day, or 33.8%, and an increase of 27.46 kilometers traveled, or 29.6%; the breakdown rate decreased by 0.32 times, or 43.9%.
    [Another Report] The company and the repair shop have also achieved significant results in conservation. For example, in August, when the company was repairing the coal cinder road, it repeatedly negotiated with the Peking Union Medical College Hospital, successfully diverting the waste coal cinder they intended to transport out of the city to the company, saving the company 750,000 [currency units] in transportation costs. In terms of office expenses, the company made full use of old paper and envelopes, and inspected pencil stubs, saving 60,000 [currency units]. It also exchanged three boxes of waste paper with the Yanjing Paper Mill for three reams of colored paper, enough for the office's needs for three months. The repair shop utilized the plates from discarded batteries to make new batteries, used scrap iron to repair vehicle bodies, and melted down waste plates into pure lead, saving a total of 739,726 [currency units], which, based on the August rice price, could be converted into 4,429 kilograms of rice. Currently, the production enthusiasm of the company and repair shop employees has greatly increased. The plan for September is to repair 15 vehicles, and in October, they are preparing to launch a campaign to complete 60 vehicles (including the 35 already completed), and are also preparing to open new bus routes.

　　京公共汽车改行包乘制
  　效率提高故障减少
    【本报讯】公营北京汽车公司自改行包乘制后，效率提高，故障率减低。该公司在八月中旬以前，由于实行轮乘制，司机对车不负责任，路上发生一点小毛病，也要打电话到公司要车去拉，然后回来往修理厂一送。修理厂对小毛病，只是马马虎虎一修。司机再开时也不仔细检查，结果刚开就坏，又往修理厂一送，追究起责任来，司机推修理厂未修好，修理厂推司机不负责，技术不好。同时由于一辆车时常换人驾驶，互相摸不清车的情况与毛病，也使故障增多，且难追究责任。这些情形，使公司遭受很大损失。因之，该公司详细研究讨论以后，自八月二十日起改用包乘制，每一辆车交两个司机，两个售票员（助手）负责，选出正副组长各一人，分担早晚两班，一切车的大、中、小修完全由这四人负责。这些司机都是从修理厂调来的大修理工，公司事先又按他们技术的好坏对每个车加以适当的配备，因之都能担负起这个任务。这样不但行车时这四个人非常小心负责，路上发生些小毛病自己就修理好了，减省了许多人力物力的浪费。在司机休息的时候，他的车也同时休息，趁机进行检查或修理，这样，司机和车都能轮班休息，也大大减少了故障的发生。休息时公司另用预备车顶替，业务也不受影响。据七月二十日到八月十九日统计，实行轮乘制的期间，平均每辆车一天有乘客三百七十六人，行驶九二·七一公里，故障率为○·七三次。八月二十日到九月十九日实行包乘制以后，一辆车一天平均有乘客五百零三人，行驶一二○·一七公里，故障率为○·四一次。共计一个车一天增加乘客一二七人，即百分之三十三·八，多驶二七·四六公里；即增百分之二十九·六公里；故障减少○·三二次，即百分之四十三·九。
    【又讯】该公司与修理厂在节约方面也有很大的成绩。如八月份公司修理煤碴路，和协和医院再三交涉，将其欲运出城外作废煤碴送到公司，使公司减省了运费七十五万。在办公费上，尽量使用旧纸旧信封，检查铅笔头等，节约了六万元，并用三箱废纸向燕京造纸厂换了三令片艳纸，足够办公室三个月需要。修理厂利用废电瓶的极板做成新电瓶，用废铁皮修补车体，把废极板溶化成纯铅等，共节约了七十三万九千七百二十六元，按八月份米价，可折米四千四百二十九斤。现在该公司与修理厂员工的生产情绪均大为提高，九月份计划修理十五部车，十月份准备展开完成六十辆车的运动（连以前已有的三十五辆在内），并准备开辟新的汽车路线。
