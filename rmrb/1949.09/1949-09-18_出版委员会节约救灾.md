　　Publishing Committee Saves on Expenses to Aid Disaster Relief
　　[Our Newspaper's News] In response to the call from the North China People's Government to launch a campaign of saving on expenses to aid disaster relief, the Publishing Committee held a mobilization meeting on the 17th and proposed that, in addition to donating money, grain, and material goods to relieve disaster victims, it is even more important to integrate this effort with our own work, practice strict economy, and strengthen production. Each individual should set out a plan for mutual challenge and competition. After a comrade whose family was in a disaster area reported on the flood situation in his hometown, all comrades immediately made enthusiastic donations, reaching more than 100 "fold-standard units" in less than half a day. More than 30 comrades set out a long-term donation plan from September this year to February next year, with one comrade donating 25 units each month. Preliminary calculations show a total of 211 units per month. In addition, old cotton clothes and other items were also donated. Everyone also unanimously suggested to the administration that the food standards should be further lowered to save on expenses for disaster relief, and that the working hours should be increased by one hour per day to strengthen work efficiency.

　　出版委员会节约救灾
    【本报讯】出版委员会响应华北人民政府展开节约救灾的号召，十七日召开动员大会，并提出除了献金、献粮、献实物，以救济灾胞外，更重要的是要与本身工作结合起来，厉行节约、加强生产，各人定出计划，互相挑战、竞赛。当一个家在灾区的同志报告过家乡水灾的情形以后，全体同志当即热烈捐献，不到半天就达一百多个折实单位。三十多个同志定出自今年九月至明年二月的长期献金计划，有一个同志每月献出二十五个单位。初步计算，每月共有二百一十一个单位。此外，还捐出旧棉衣服等多件。大家并一致向行政上提出要再降低伙食标准，节约救灾，每天增加工作一小时，加强工作效率等建议。
