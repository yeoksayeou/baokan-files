Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 19th: According to TASS, Moscow: *Pravda*, *Izvestia*, and *Red Star* have successively published editorials in the past two days, commenting on the shameful failure of the great conspiracy of American, British, and French imperialism and the Tito clique in Hungary, and unanimously calling on the people of the world to heighten vigilance. The conclusion of *Pravda*'s September 17th editorial was: "Vigilance, more vigilance! This is the conclusion that all freedom-loving people around the world have now reached with new strength." *Izvestia*'s September 18th editorial pointed out: The trial of the employed Hungarian and Yugoslav spies and assassins is of great significance because it teaches the people to be vigilant and calls on them to use greater strength to smash the conspiracies of the instigators of a new war and defend the cause of peace. The conclusion of *Red Star*'s September 18th editorial stated: The exposure of spies in Budapest and Belgrade urges all freedom-loving people around the world to heighten their revolutionary vigilance and thwart all efforts of imperialist spies in the future.

*Pravda* stated: The indictment of the Rajk conspiracy case shows that as World War II was nearing its end, the American and British espionage centers concentrated their efforts on trying to occupy the countries of the Balkan Peninsula and the Danube River Basin to prevent the victory of the people's democratic movement in these countries and maintain the bourgeois exploitative regimes in these countries. The Yugoslav bourgeois nationalists in the Tito and Ranković clique were designated by the American and British ruling groups to play a central role in this plan.

The indictment, which has now been published, contains conclusive evidence that the main part of Tito's closest confidants were recruited by American and British imperialists long ago to carry out espionage activities, and they were especially encouraged by Churchill. During World War II, the intense activities carried out by American and British spies around Tito were actually based on a conspiracy of extensive secret collusion.

The main point of this conspiracy was that after the end of the war, with the help of Yugoslavia, the "Balkan version" of Churchill's wartime "strategy" would be implemented to consolidate imperialism's position in the Balkans. The indictment proves that the Yugoslav rulers cultivated conspiracy organizations in Hungary and directed all their criminal activities. After the Rajk and Ranković spy groups were proven guilty beyond any doubt, they confessed to the Tito clique's plan. Ranković, one of the Yugoslav fascist leaders, told his Hungarian partner Rajk these plans, wanting to pull all the people's democratic countries over to the side of the American imperialists with the help of Yugoslavia.

In order to achieve this goal, the Tito clique established secret spy networks in various people's democratic countries and played a central role in coordinating the criminal activities of foreign spies and the entire spy organization. This clique tried its best to unite the reactionary nationalist, Catholic, and fascist groups in the people's democratic countries and directed their sabotage activities.

After the Information Bureau issued a resolution exposing the Tito clique as bourgeois nationalists who betrayed the cause of socialism, Tito and his followers adopted new tactics in their struggle against the people's democratic countries and the Soviet Union.

Tito's plan stipulated that the following three tasks be completed under the new situation: First, to turn the Yugoslav people against the Soviet Union; second, to win over all reactionary and anti-people elements in the people's democratic countries; and third, to maintain a pro-imperialist line.

According to this heinous plan, the Yugoslav spy group formulated a whole set of provocative measures to undermine the Yugoslav working people's love and friendship for the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. With the help of vicious and slanderous propaganda, the Tito clique wanted to shift the responsibility for the economic chaos in Yugoslavia caused by the disastrous policies pursued by the Yugoslav fascists onto the Soviet Union. The meaning of this propaganda was to make the masses of the people believe that Tito's reliance on imperialist forces was justified.

Regarding Hungary, Tito and his imperialist masters planned to overthrow the people's democratic system by means of armed intervention and turning Hungary into an imperialist colony.

The purpose of Yugoslav and American intervention was to restore the bourgeois regime in Hungary, bring Hungary, and then other people's democratic countries, into the imperialist sphere of influence, and create conditions for the imperialist countries to enslave these countries.

This anti-Hungarian adventure, jointly prepared by spies in Belgrade and Budapest, was motivated by a desire to restore reactionary regimes in the people's democratic countries, turn the Balkans into a powder keg, undermine peace and international security, and prepare a springboard for another war.

Fascist plans inevitably require the use of fascist tactics. The Tito clique completely followed the methods and means of the Hitler secret police in its struggle against the people's democratic countries. The Yugoslav fascists planned to take the "experience" they had gained in the terrorist persecution of the outstanding sons and daughters of the Yugoslav people outside the Yugoslav borders and use it in Hungary. The bloody crimes planned by Tito and Ranković were to physically eliminate the most outstanding representatives of the Hungarian government. With disgusting shamelessness, the executioner Ranković taught his lackeys in Hungary how to kill communist leaders, demanding that his party members carry out assassinations in various ways, sometimes by "accidents," sometimes by "suicide," and also by "sudden death" and "shooting while escaping."

The conspiracy of spies in Belgrade and Budapest has been uncovered. The crimes of the enemies of the People's Hungary, the enemies of all the people's democratic countries, and the mortal enemies of the cause of peace and friendship among nations are conclusive and undeniable. The imperialists' plan has failed.

The imperialist bosses and their Yugoslav lackeys hoped to establish a fifth column in Hungary. But their calculations were wrong.

The imperialist bosses and their spies in Yugoslavia and Hungary intended to separate Hungary, and then other people's democratic countries, from the camp of peace and democracy. These plans also ended in miserable failure. The friendship between the people's democratic countries and the Soviet Union has never been so consolidated as it is now.

　　真理报等论拉伊克叛国案
  　号召世界人民提高警惕
    粉碎帝国主义间谍一切阴谋
    【新华社北平十九日电】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报、消息报、红星报近两日相继发表社论，评论美英法帝国主义及铁托集团在匈牙利的大阴谋的可耻失败，并一致号召全世界人民提高警惕性。真理报十七日社论的结语是：“警惕，再警惕！这就是全世界爱自由的人民现在以新的力量所得出来的结论。”消息报十八日社论指出：对受雇用的匈牙利和南斯拉夫间谍和刺客的审讯，有着巨大的意义，因为它教导人民警觉，号召他们以更大的力量粉碎新战争挑拨者的阴谋，保卫和平的事业。红星报十八日社论的结语称：布达佩斯和贝尔格莱德的间谍的暴露，敦促全世界爱好自由的人民提高其革命的警觉，并在将来同样地挫败帝国主义间谍的一切努力。
    真理报称：对拉伊克等阴谋案的起诉书显示：在第二次世界大战行将结束的时候，美国和英国的间谍中心机关就集中力量，设法盘据在巴尔干半岛和多瑙河流域的国家中，防止这些国家的人民民主运动获得胜利，保持这些国家的资产阶级剥削政权。铁托和兰科维奇集团里的南斯拉夫资产阶级民族主义者，被美国及英国统治集团指定要在这个计划中发挥中心作用。
    现在起诉书已经发表它确凿的证据：铁托最亲信人物中的主要部分，很早以前就被美英帝国主义者招募去作间谍活动，他们特别得到邱吉尔的鼓励。在第二次世界大战期间，美国和英国间谍所进行的围绕着铁托的紧张活动，实际上有着规模广泛的秘密勾结的阴谋为其基础。
    这一阴谋的要点是在战争结束之后，在南斯拉夫的帮助下，实行战时邱吉尔“战略”的“巴尔干版”，巩固帝国主义在巴尔干的地位。起诉书证明：南斯拉夫统治者在匈牙利培养了阴谋组织，并由他们指使全部的罪恶活动。拉伊克与兰科维奇的间谍集团经证明罪状确凿无可抵赖之后，供出了铁托集团的计划。作为南斯拉夫法西斯头目之一的兰科维奇，把这些计划告诉了他在匈牙利的伙伴拉伊克，要在南斯拉夫的帮助下，把所有的人民民主国家拉到美帝国主义者方面去。
    铁托集团为了达到这一目的，在各人民民主国家建立了秘密间谍网，并起了配合外国间谍人员和整个间谍组织罪恶活动的中心的作用。这一集团竭力纠合人民民主国家中反动民族主义、天主教与法西斯的集团，并指挥它们的破坏活动。
    在情报局发表决议，揭露铁托集团是背叛社会主义事业的资产阶级民族主义分子之后，铁托及其党徒在反对人民民主国家与苏联的斗争中，采用了新的策略。
    铁托的计划规定在新形势下完成下列三个任务：第一、使南斯拉夫人民反对苏联；第二、拉拢人民民主国家中一切反动的反人民分子；第三、保持亲帝国主义国家的路线。
    南斯拉夫奸细集团按照这一罪大恶极的计划，拟出了整套的挑拨措施，用以破坏南斯拉夫劳动人民对苏联与人民民主国家的热爱与友谊。在恶毒与诽谤宣传的帮助下，铁托集团想把由于南斯拉夫法西斯分子奉行灾难政策而招致的南斯拉夫经济混乱的责任，推在苏联身上。这种宣传的意思就是要使人民群众相信铁托投靠帝国主义势力是正当的。
    关于匈牙利，铁托及其帝国主义主子计划以武装干涉和变匈牙利为帝国主义殖民地的手段，来推翻人民民主制度。
    南斯拉夫与美国干涉的目的，是要在匈牙利恢复资产阶级的政权，把匈牙利，然后再把其他人民民主国家包括在帝国主义势力范围之内，并为帝国主义国家奴役这些国家创造条件。
    这一由贝尔格莱德的间谍与布达佩斯的间谍联合准备的反对匈牙利的冒险，其动机是想要在人民民主国家恢复反动政权，变巴尔干为火药库，破坏和平与国际安全，和为另一次战争准备好跳板。
    法西斯计划不可避免地要使用法西斯策略。铁托集团在它反对人民民主国家的斗争中完全沿用着希特勒秘密警察的那一套方法与手段。南斯拉夫法西斯分子打算把他们在对南斯拉夫人民的优秀儿女进行恐怖的迫害时所取得的“经验”，拿到南斯拉夫国界以外、到匈牙利来使用。铁托与兰科维奇的血腥罪行的计划，要在肉体上消灭匈牙利政府的最卓越的代表。刽子手兰科维奇以令人恶心的无耻，教导他在匈牙利的走狗用什么方法杀害共产党领袖，他要求他的党羽用各种不同的方法进行暗杀，有时用“偶然事件”，有时用“自杀”，还有“暴死”和“逃跑时被枪杀”。
    在贝尔格莱德与布达佩斯的间谍的阴谋被破获了。人民匈牙利的敌人，一切人民民主国家的敌人，和平事业与各民族间友谊的死敌的罪证确凿，无可抵赖。帝国主义者的计划失败了。
    帝国主义头子及其南斯拉夫走狗希望在匈牙利建立第五纵队。但是，他们的算盘打错了。
    帝国主义头子及其在南斯拉夫和匈牙利的间谍打算使匈牙利，然后再使其他人民民主国家脱离和平与民主阵营。这些计划也以惨败而告结束。人民民主国家与苏联的友谊从来没有现在这样巩固。
