The Dalian Industrial Exhibition (hereinafter referred to as the Industrial Exhibition), a review of the industrial production strength of the Dalian region, solemnly opened on the morning of the 18th after more than five months of preparation. That morning, the city was full of red flags, and balloons rose high, forming the slogan "Celebrating the Opening of the Industrial Exhibition," fluttering in the sky at dawn. The opening ceremony was held at 10:00 a.m. in the Industrial Exhibition Theater, attended by leading party and government officials of the Dalian region, representatives of the Soviet military command, and representatives of various enterprises, institutions, and organizations, totaling more than 500 people. The conference unanimously approved the entire members of the Politburo of the CPSU Central Committee, headed by Marshal Stalin, and the entire members of the Politburo of the CPC Central Committee, headed by Chairman Mao Zedong, as the honorary presidium of the conference.

This is the result of the arduous struggle of the working class and the working people of the entire Dalian region. It proves to everyone that China must be industrialized, and the Chinese people have the ability to achieve industrialization. The advanced socialist Soviet Union has set a brilliant example for us in progressing from an agricultural country to an industrial country.
