Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 6th: Rome dispatch: Eighty thousand junior bank employees in Italy began a nationwide strike on September 1st to protest the bank's unilateral decision to revise working hours. The striking employees belong to the National Federation of Trade Unions and other unions. The Italian General Confederation of Labor fully supports the striking employees and defends the principle that collective agreements must be amended with the consent of workers' representatives. Vittorio, Secretary-General of the General Confederation of Labor, said at a meeting of the Steelworkers' Union and other employees in Florence that the General Confederation of Labor had notified trade unions across the country, urging them to support the struggle of bank employees. Vittorio said: "If the bank employees themselves cannot defend their rights, we will mobilize working people in other industries to participate in the struggle so that the financial tycoons of Italy will know that it is impossible to unilaterally impose their will on the working people."

　　意八万银行雇员举行全国性罢工
  　总工会号召各工会支援
    【新华社北平六日电】罗马讯：意大利八万银行下级雇员，于九月一日起举行全国规模的罢工运动，以反对银行资方擅自修改工作时间的决定。罢工雇员分属全国总工会与其他工会。意大利总工会充分支持罢工雇员，并保卫集体协议必须经工人代表的同意而修改的原则，总工会总书记维特里奥在佛罗伦萨的钢铁工人联合会及其他雇员的大会上演说称：总工会已通知全国的工会，敦促他们支援银行雇员的奋斗。维特里奥称：“若银行雇员自己不能保卫他们的权利，我们将发动其他各业的劳动人民参加斗争，以便使意大利的财阀们知道，单方面将其意志强加于劳动人民身上是不行的。”
