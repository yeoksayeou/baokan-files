The preparatory committee for the Shenyang Municipal People's Representative Conference has already been formed and has drafted an outline for collecting opinions to broadly gather input from people from all walks of life. The conference is scheduled to be held on the 19th. The Jilin Municipal People's Government also decided at a recent joint meeting of representatives from all sectors to convene the Jilin Municipal People's Representative Conference in late September. The meeting also decided that in electing representatives, full democratic education should be conducted among the masses to publicize the nature, tasks, and role of the People's Representative Conference and to explain the content and purpose of this conference, and to widely solicit the people's opinions on the government. In addition, the People's Representative Conferences of Yanji, Longjing, and Tumen in the same province will also be held at the same time. The Dalian Municipal People's Representative Conference has decided to be held from the 23rd to the 25th of this month and is currently actively preparing. In mid-August, the Liaodong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party instructed all cities in the province to actively prepare to convene People's Representative Conferences in September to summarize past government work and discuss future tasks, focusing the conference discussions on opposing waste, practicing thrift, developing industry and commerce that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, and adjusting labor-management relations.
