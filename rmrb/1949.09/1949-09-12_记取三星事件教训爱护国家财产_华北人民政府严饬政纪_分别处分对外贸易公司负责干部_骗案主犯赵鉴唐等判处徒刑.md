　　Remembering the Lessons of the Samsung Incident and Cherishing State Property
　  North China People's Government Strictly Enforces Discipline
    Responsible Cadres of the Foreign Trade Company Are Punished
　  Chief Culprit of the Fraud Case, Zhao Jiantang, and Others Sentenced to Imprisonment
    [Our Dispatch] The massive fraud case involving Tianjin Samsung Foreign Trade Company (hereinafter referred to as Samsung), which engaged in speculative buying and selling and obtained a large amount of loan payments from the North China Foreign Trade Company using fake insurance policies, has been fully resolved. The North China People's Government has imposed disciplinary actions on relevant personnel of the Foreign Trade Company.
    The case occurred in May of this year. At that time, the Foreign Trade Company was tasked with purchasing copper wire. Cao Zhongshu, the Deputy Manager of the company, was introduced to Zhao Jiantang, the manager of Samsung Foreign Trade Company (which was not registered with the Bureau of Industry and Commerce and the Foreign Trade Bureau). Zhao claimed to be able to procure the goods. On April 9th, the two parties signed a contract for 1,000 tons of copper wire, but it was canceled because Samsung could not find a bank to provide a guarantee. On April 16th, Zhao Jiantang contacted the Foreign Trade Company again regarding selling pig bristles and purchasing copper wire. The two parties immediately signed a contract for 3,000 tons of copper wire, stipulating that Samsung would provide the foreign exchange, and the funds would be withdrawn upon receipt of a bank guarantee, with delivery within 40 days of payment. After the contract was signed, Samsung, unable to directly purchase goods from abroad or obtain a bank guarantee, asked his close friend Rao Yongze to ask Haining Foreign Firm to purchase goods on their behalf. Although Rao did not actually negotiate a contract with Haining Foreign Firm, Zhao Jiantang falsely claimed to the Foreign Trade Company that he had purchased the goods from Haining Foreign Firm. On April 29th, Zhao Jiantang fraudulently presented an English notification from the Tianjin Huabi Bank to the Foreign Trade Company, passing it off as a guarantee, and claiming that once the bank received the payment, it would guarantee delivery and settlement. Chen Shi, the Director of the Audit Office of the company, did not read or translate the notification, mistakenly believed Zhao, and took it as a guarantee. On May 3rd, he signed a supplementary contract with Samsung for the delivery of 1,000 tons, with the payment of 444 million yuan made in full from May 3rd to 6th. After obtaining this huge sum, Samsung's Zhao Jiantang did not exchange the Huabi Bank receipt for a guarantee and hand it over to the Foreign Trade Company. Instead, he deposited 315 million yuan in twelve banks and money houses, including Tianjin Jiu'an, Shanghai, United, Mainland, and HSBC, and used the remaining over 100 million yuan for speculation and squandering. At the same time, Zhao, using the excuse of needing foreign exchange to purchase copper wire from Haining Foreign Firm, requested permission from the Foreign Trade Company to purchase unified sales export goods on the market. Although not approved, he illegally purchased pig bristles and carpets at high prices. Due to the injection of this huge amount of funds into the market (in early May, Samsung's deposits in various banks and money houses were equivalent to the total daily check clearing amount of the city's banks and money houses at that time), it affected price fluctuations. It was not until May 19th, when the Tianjin People's Bank discovered Samsung's huge deposit of 10 million yuan in one transaction when checking the accounts of the Mainland Bank, that this matter attracted attention from all parties. At this time, the Foreign Trade Company repeatedly urged Samsung to submit a formal guarantee and fulfill the contract, and Samsung's scam was completely exposed. On May 27th, the Foreign Trade Company filed a complaint with the Tianjin People's Court, which detained Samsung's Deputy General Manager Liu Xijiu and Manager Zhao Jiantang. The next day, the Tianjin People's Bank froze over 210 million yuan of Samsung's funds deposited in various banks and money houses, and sealed up three sets and six and a quarter of a set of pig bristles and 36,000 square feet of carpets stored by Samsung. At this time, the prices of pig bristles and carpets rose, and even calculated at the increased prices, the total value of its inventory and frozen deposits was still less than 400 million yuan, which was more than 40 million yuan less than the original payment. Adding in the loss of 180 million yuan in foreign exchange rates, the scam caused a loss of over 226 million yuan in state assets. In order to rectify discipline, the North China People's Government decided on the 10th of this month to issue a major demerit to Cao Zhongshu, the Deputy Manager of the North China Foreign Trade Company who was directly responsible for the case, and Chen Shi, the Director of the Audit Office. Although Manager Guo Jinwu did not directly manage the matter, he did not carefully examine Zhao Jiantang or inform the company to conduct an examination before introducing him to Cao Zhongshu for trade. The signing of the contract with Samsung had also been approved by him, and he failed to conduct a subsequent inspection. He was given a serious warning.
    [Another Dispatch] The Tianjin People's Court, finding that Samsung Trade's General Manager and Deputy Manager Li Shuyan, Liu Xijiu, and Manager Zhao Jiantang had committed wrongdoing, daring to defraud the state of a huge amount of assets this time, announced on August 24th, after interrogation, that the chief culprit Zhao Jiantang was sentenced to five years imprisonment, Liu Xijiu to three years imprisonment, and that fugitive Li Shuyan would be dealt with separately after being arrested and brought to justice. The North China Foreign Trade Company's asset losses will be compensated by the above three criminals.

　　记取三星事件教训爱护国家财产
　  华北人民政府严饬政纪
    分别处分对外贸易公司负责干部
　  骗案主犯赵鉴唐等判处徒刑
    【本报讯】天津三星国外贸易行（以下简称三星）买空卖空，以假保单套取华北对外贸易公司大宗货款的巨大诈骗案已全部解决，华北人民政府并对对外贸易公司有关人员分别予以处分。
    该案发生于本年五月。时对外贸易公司受命购进紫铜丝。该公司副经理曹中枢经介绍与一未经工商局与对外贸易局登记的三星国外贸易行的经理赵鉴唐相识，赵自称能购得此项货物，曾先于四月九日双方订立紫铜丝一千吨之合同，惟因三星未能觅得银行作保作罢。四月十六日，赵鉴唐又到对外贸易公司接洽出售猪鬃与采购紫铜丝事，双方当即订立紫铜丝三千吨合同，并约定外汇由三星自备，款额凭银行保单提取，付款后四十天内交货。合同订立后，三星因自己不能直接向国外购货，并不能取得银行保单，乃由赵鉴唐转托其密友饶用泽请海宁洋行代购。虽然事实上饶并未与海宁洋行商订合同，赵鉴唐却向对外贸易公司谎称已自海宁洋行购妥。四月二十九日，赵鉴唐诡将天津华比银行英文通知书冒充保单送给对外贸易公司，并谓一俟银行收到货款，即生保证交货结汇之效。该公司审计室主任陈实对该通知书未加阅读翻译，误信赵言，当成保单，乃于五月三日与三星订立交货一千吨之补充合同，货款四亿四千四百万元于五月三日至六日全部付清。三星赵鉴唐获此巨款，并未将华比银行收据换得保单交与对外贸易公司，且将此款分存天津久安、上海、联合、大陆、汇丰等十二家银行钱庄，共计三亿一千五百万元，而将其余一亿多元从事投机挥霍。同时赵又借口向海宁洋行购铜丝需外汇，要求对外贸易公司准其在市场上采购统销出口物资，虽未得批准，但竟擅自违法以高价抢购猪鬃、地毯等。由于此项巨额资金投入市场（五月初，三星在各行庄的存款，相当于当时全市行庄每日票据交换金额的总数），曾影响物价发生很大波动。直至五月十九日天津人民银行于检查大陆银行帐目发现三星一次存入一千万元的巨额存款时，此事才引起各方注意。对外贸易公司此时才再三催促三星交出正式保单，履行合同，而三星的骗局才完全败露。五月二十七日，对外贸易公司向天津市人民法院控告，法院当将三星副总经理刘锡九与经理赵鉴唐扣押。次日天津人民银行即冻结三星存放各银行钱庄之货款二亿一千余万元，并封存三星所存之猪鬃三套又六成二五及地毯三万六千方尺。此时猪鬃地毯价格上涨，即按涨价计算，其存货折价与所冻结存款总数仍不足四亿元，较原所付货款相差四千多万元，加上外汇牌价损失一亿八千万元，故此骗案使国家资财损失二亿二千六百余万元。华北人民政府为了整饬政纪，于本月十日决定将华北对外贸易公司对此案直接负责人副经理曹中枢与审计室主任陈实各记大过一次。经理郭今吾虽未直接管理其事，但他对赵鉴唐未详加考察或告诉公司考察即介绍与曹中枢来往贸易，与三星订立合同又曾经过他的批准，事后又不检查，决予严重警告。
    【又讯】天津市人民法院以三星贸易总正副行经理李树岩、刘锡九与经理赵鉴唐为非作歹，此次竟敢诈骗国家巨量资财，经审讯，于八月二十四日宣布判处主犯赵鉴唐有期徒刑五年，刘锡九有期徒刑三年，逃犯李树岩缉拿归案后另处。华北对外贸易公司所受资财损失，由以上三犯负责赔偿。
