　　China Association for Promoting Democracy
　　Denounces U.S. Imperialist White Paper

[This News Report] The China Association for Promoting Democracy has published a special article denouncing the White Paper, exposing the consistent U.S. imperialist strategy of aggression against China. The original text is as follows:

U.S. imperialism is adept at using deceptive means, consistently using the term "friendship" as a guise to implement its strategy of aggression against China. Therefore, the White Paper's deception and conspiracy must be exposed, so that those who in the past had more or less illusions about the imperialists, as well as the so-called "democratic individualists" in the eyes of the U.S. imperialists, can recognize the true face of the American robbers.

Acheson said: "Despite the wide differences in distance and background that separate China and the United States, the religious, charitable, and cultural ties that bind the two nations have often strengthened America's friendship with China. This friendship can be proven by the facts of many years."

Now let's cite a few examples to prove this "friendship" of the U.S. imperialists: (1) The Treaty of Wanghia in 1844 forced China to accept the five-port trade system, following the example of the British-Chinese Treaty of Nanjing, implementing economic aggression; forced China to allow Americans to go deep into the interior to preach and run schools, implementing cultural aggression, and paralyzing the Chinese people; and forced China to grant extraterritorial rights. (2) In 1900, the United States actively participated in the Eight-Nation Alliance, invading China, massacring the Chinese people, and forcing the Boxer Indemnity. (3) In 1919, the United States supported Japan in inheriting Germany's interests in Shandong. (4) In 1925, U.S. troops participated in the massacre of the people of Shanghai. (5) In 1927, U.S. warships shelled Nanjing. (6) From 1931 to 1940, the United States supplied Japan with a large amount of military equipment to invade China. (7) After Japan surrendered in 1945, the U.S. government used more than 5.914 billion U.S. dollars to instigate the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to massacre millions of Chinese people. (8) After the liberation of Shanghai, U.S. warships, airplanes, and submarines, flying the Kuomintang flag, blockaded the Chinese coast. This "friendship" is enough for us to never forget, right? For more than a hundred years, the United States has consistently carried out aggression against China, attempting to enslave the Chinese people, yet it still speaks of "friendship," "friendship." Isn't this deception?

U.S. imperialism is clearly interfering in China's internal affairs, yet it falsely claims non-interference. The White Paper says: "The United States has always maintained and still maintains the various basic principles of its China policy, including the Open Door Policy, respect for China's administrative and territorial integrity, and opposition to any foreign control of China, etc."

At the end of the 19th century, the United States saw that other imperialists had already taken the lead and had territory in China. It was a rising imperialist power, and at that time it only wanted to come in and share the spoils, so it demanded "Open Door" and "equal opportunity." The so-called "Open Door Policy," translated into popular language, is the "fat meat for everyone to eat" principle. After World War I, the United States was not satisfied with "everyone eating," it wanted to "eat more"; after World War II, it simply wanted to "swallow" China, to make China a second Philippines, to make China the forefront of the U.S. anti-Soviet and anti-communist strategy. What method did it use to achieve this goal? It used a group of running dogs – the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, who had "degenerated into corruption" and "alienated themselves from the people" – to launch a civil war to massacre the Chinese people. If anyone doesn't believe it, listen to the U.S. imperialists' own confession: (1) "Assisting the National Government to establish its authority in as wide an area as possible in China." (2) "Intervening on a large scale in the military aspect, assisting the Kuomintang in destroying the Communist Party." (3) "From 1945 until the early autumn of 1948, the National Government had a significant advantage over its opponents in terms of manpower and military equipment. Indeed, during that period, to a large extent due to our assistance in transportation, arming, and supplying their troops, they were able to extend their control to most of North China and Manchuria." (4) "Marshal Marshall hoped that his stay in China would encourage the liberal elements in the non-Communist areas of China to more forcefully develop their strength than in the past and exert a fermenting effect on the autocracy implemented by reactionaries and warmongers. Marshal Marshall remained in China until the National Assembly completed its work." (5) Wedemeyer suggested: "And requested that Manchuria be placed under the guardianship or trusteeship of the five powers." (6) "The only other path that the United States could take was to fully intervene for a government that had lost the confidence of its people. Such intervention would require spending even more money than has been ineffectively spent so far, requiring American officers to command the National Government's troops, and possibly involving American armed forces – land, sea, and air – thus resulting in war." In addition, we should not ignore a more blatant new aggression that the U.S. is currently carrying out, that is, it wants to annex China's Taiwan Province, using the pretext that "Taiwan is still Japanese territory before the signing of the peace treaty with Japan," as the last U.S. colony in China. Isn't it slapping itself in the face when it speaks of "non-interference in China's internal affairs" and "respect for the integrity of China's territory"? This kind of robber gang in the United States will certainly be opposed by the Chinese people, condemned by the American people, and spurned by all humane people in the world.

Why did the U.S. imperialists help the Kuomintang attempt to destroy the Communist Party? Because the Chinese Communist Party is capable and willing to strive. If anyone doesn't believe it, listen to what the U.S. imperialists themselves say: The Chinese Communist Party "is the most strictly organized, best disciplined, most efficient, and most constructive group in China." (Supplementary material to the White Paper "The Chinese Communist Movement" published by the U.S. State Department; the same applies to the following passage). This is a truth that the U.S. imperialists were forced to leak out.

"The people are mostly on the side of the Communist Party... Many middle parties have also shown a tendency to prefer to cooperate with the Communist Party rather than with the Kuomintang." This is another truth that was forced to leak out.

If the United States were truly what it claims to be, speaking of "morality," "friendship," and "democracy," then, now that China has such a political organization that is the most strictly organized, best disciplined, has the greatest efficiency and constructiveness, and is supported by all the Chinese people and many democratic parties, it should congratulate China. Why, instead, does it want to destroy it? Precisely because the Communist Party is good, the U.S. imperialists want to destroy it! Because with the Communist Party, China has hope! Because with the Communist Party, the United States cannot treat China as the Philippines! Conversely, why has the U.S. imperialist always supported and continues to support the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang? Because the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang is their running dog, it is anti-people and anti-communist. Listen to what the U.S. imperialists themselves say: "In the years after the New Fourth Army Incident... the Chongqing government gradually became unwilling to use its best troops to resist Japan. (Please note: The Kuomintang's so-called resistance to Japan was actually like this) ...Many troops of the Chongqing government or the Kuomintang even joined the puppet army and attacked the Communist Party with the support of the Japanese army. (Please note: This is evidence of the collusion between the Kuomintang and the Japanese puppets.)..." From the mouth of the U.S. imperialists, it is helplessly confessed that: Precisely because the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang is degenerate, corrupt, does not resist the Japanese invaders, massacres patriotic people, is strongly condemned by middle parties and non-party figures, is anti-people, the U.S. imperialists favor it and support it with all their strength; precisely because the Chinese Communist Party is good, constructive, patriotic, resists the enemy, loves the people, and democratic parties and non-party figures are willing to cooperate with it, and the Chinese people wholeheartedly support it, the U.S. imperialists treat it as a mortal enemy and vainly attempt to destroy it. Isn't the U.S. imperialists' attempt to destroy China obvious enough? Don't be fooled by the White Paper, thinking that the U.S. imperialists have lost their vision and are now condemning the Kuomintang's incompetence and lack of ambition. No, the Kuomintang did not suddenly become bad; the U.S. imperialists deliberately chose a bad one. The White Paper's condemnation of the Kuomintang is merely shifting responsibility to the domestic opposition. It is "striking the son's body, but the mother's heart aches," giving the Kuomintang another shot in the arm. Capable and ambitious Chinese people will certainly not be willing to sell out their country; if you are unwilling to sell out your country, what does it need you for? Isn't the U.S. imperialists' intention clear enough?

The Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang has been defeated by the power of the Chinese people, and the U.S. imperialists have admitted that "our assistance has been ineffective" and "beyond the control of the U.S. government." Then, it should give up. However, that is not the case. Imperialism not invading is like a dog not eating feces. This is its "nature" and cannot be changed. The U.S. imperialists also want to recruit "democratic individualists" to serve them. The so-called "democratic individualists" obviously refer to a group of people who still have illusions about old democracy or Anglo-American style democracy. Such people do exist in China, and the Chinese people naturally still need to be vigilant against them. But under the broad unity of the people throughout the country, these individualists will inevitably be gradually transformed; if they stubbornly refuse to change, become detached from the masses, and willingly become running dogs of U.S. imperialism, betraying the motherland, the result will certainly be their demise. The U.S. imperialists' fantasy is nothing more than a bubble.

American capitalists who get rich from war, imperialists who live by exploiting colonies and semi-colonies, are most afraid of the Soviet Union, which opposes aggression, opposes exploitation, opposes fascism, sympathizes with the national independence and people's democratic movements of various countries, and safeguards world peace. The more the forces leaning towards democracy and peace increase by one point, the more the imperialists' power of aggression is weakened by one point. The U.S. imperialists see that China, with a population of 475 million, has basically achieved revolutionary victory, and unequivocally expressed its leaning towards the Soviet Union and joining the world peace camp. How can it not wail and rant and curse in the streets?

Why do we lean towards the Soviet Union? Because we want democracy, independence, freedom, and peace. Why don't we lean towards U.S. imperialism? Because we are unwilling to be slaves of colonies, unwilling to fight for fascists, and unwilling to support the system of people eating people! Today, there are only two paths before us: one is a dead end, which is the aggressive line headed by the U.S. imperialists; the other is a living path, which is the peaceful line headed by the socialist Soviet Union.

The U.S. imperialists have consistently been robbers who have invaded China, and even today, they are still seducing so-called "democratic individualists," sending the Fifth Column to sabotage China's revolution and construction, and supporting Japanese warlords to attack China again. The Soviet Union, since the October Revolution, has always been a friend of China. It treats us as equals, it does not interfere in China's internal affairs, it expresses sympathy for our just struggle, and it welcomes our revolutionary victory. "China's long-standing civilization" has taught the Chinese people to "repay kindness with kindness and resentment with justice." We will inevitably resolutely oppose all imperialists and unite with the Soviet Union, which treats us as equals, to fight together.

The victory of the Chinese revolution relies on the power of the Chinese people's own struggle, relies on the objective situation of the world's anti-imperialist and anti-aggression movements, but has never received Soviet airplanes, artillery, warships, tanks, military equipment, or gold yuan. Even Marshall declared that the Soviet Union did not help the Communist Party, and the White Paper cannot cite any evidence of Soviet aid to the People's Liberation Army. Then, how do we explain the ranting and cursing words such as "foreign control of China," "Soviet rule of China," and "serving Soviet interests"? Originally, the U.S. imperialists called everything that was "non-American" as "foreign" and everything that was "not ruled by the United States" as "ruled by the Soviet Union." Therefore, all Chinese people who support the Chinese Communist Party, participate in or approve of anti-American and anti-Chiang activities are called "foreigners" and are called "Soviets." Everyone knows that what is now controlling China (except for the areas to be liberated) and ruling China is the Chinese people led by the Chinese Communist Party, not the U.S. imperialists. The U.S. imperialists believe that this is "foreign control of China" and "Soviet rule of China." This is the logic of the U.S. imperialists!

The White Paper is the U.S. imperialists confessing without being beaten that their essence is a complete aggressor, so the basic principles of its China policy are "including the Open Door Policy, respecting the integrity of China's administration and territory, and opposing any foreign control of China, etc." This is because it has definitely made China its colony that it dares to boldly insult us. Looking at this White Paper, despite such distortion of right and wrong, it has exposed some facts that we should always remember, namely: (1) The U.S. imperialists' consistent policy towards China is to turn China into its colony. (2) The U.S. imperialists' aggressive policy is irreconcilable with the interests of the Chinese people and all people who love democracy, freedom, independence, and peace. (3) The U.S. imperialists and China's and other countries' reactionary traitorous governments collude with each other; they are irreconcilable with China's and other countries' Communist Parties and working people. (4) The U.S. imperialists will never automatically withdraw from China. (5) Even if the U.S. imperialists are completely driven out of China by the power of the Chinese people, they will still use various vicious means to sabotage our construction. Therefore, we must do the following things:

(1) We must, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, unite as one, thoroughly eliminate the remaining forces of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and destroy any democratic individualists who dare to come out and be enemies of the people.

(2) We must, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, unswervingly "unite with the nations of the world that treat me as equals to fight together."

(3) We must resolutely fight against imperialism and drive all imperialists out of China.

(4) We must intensify the study of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought.

(5) We must learn from the Soviet Union's experience in building the country, overcome all difficulties, achieve cooperation between labor and capital, mutual communication between urban and rural areas, develop production, prosper the economy, and build a new democratic China led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants.

### 中国民主促进会　痛斥美帝白皮书

　　中国民主促进会
  　痛斥美帝白皮书
    【本报讯】中国民主促进会发表专文，斥责白皮书，揭穿美帝一贯的侵华策略。原文如下：
    美帝国主义是擅长于用欺骗手段的，他是一贯地用“友谊”这名词作幌子，实行他的侵华的策略。因此，白皮书的骗局和阴谋，必须予以揭穿，使那些过去对帝国主义者曾经有过或多或少幻想的一部分人，以及在美帝国主义者心目中的所谓“民主个人主义”者，认清美国强盗的本来面目。
    艾奇逊说：“尽管距离及背景上广泛的差异把中国和美国隔开，但结合中美两民族的宗教上，慈善事业上以及文化上的联系，常使美国对中国的友谊加强。这种友谊是可用许多年来的种种事实予以证明的。”
    现在我们举几个例子来证明一下美帝国主义者的这种“友谊”吧：（一）一八四四年的望厦条约援中英南京条约例强迫中国接受五口通商，实行经济侵略；强迫中国让美国人深入内地传教办学，实行文化侵略，麻醉中国人民。并强迫中国给与治外法权。（二）一九○○年，美国积极参加八国联军，侵略中国，屠杀中国人民，迫出庚子赔款。（三）一九一九年，美国支持日本继承德国在山东的权益。（四）一九二五年，美军参加对上海人民的屠杀。（五）一九二七年，美国军舰炮轰南京。（六）一九三一年到一九四○年，美国以大量的军火供给日本侵略中国。（七）一九四五年，日本投降以后，美国政府以五十九亿一千四百余万美金煽动蒋介石匪帮屠杀几百万中国人民。（八）上海解放以后，美国军舰、飞机、潜水艇挂着国民党的招牌封锁中国海岸。这种“友谊”尽够我们忘记不了吧。一百多年来，美国一贯的对华侵略，企图奴役中国人民，可还口口声声地说“友谊”，“友谊”，这不是欺骗是什么？
    美帝国主义明明是干涉中国内政，却伪称是不干涉。白皮书说：“美国始终维持并且现在依然维持对华外交政策的各种基本原则，包括门户开放主义，尊重中国的行政和领土完整，以及反对任何外国控制中国等。”
    十九世纪末年，美国眼看别的帝国主义者已经捷足先登，在中国都有了地盘，他是后起的帝国主义者，那时候只想进来坐地分赃，于是要求“门户开放”，“利益均沾”。所谓“门户开放主义”，译成通俗的话，就是“肥肉大家吃主义”。第一次大战以后，美国不满足于“大家吃”，他要“多吃些”；第二次大战以后，它又干脆要“独吞”中国，要把中国作为菲列滨第二，要把中国作为美国反苏反共最前线。用什么方法来达到这个目的呢？它就利用一群走狗——“已经堕落于腐败”、“自绝于国人”的蒋介石匪帮，发动屠杀中国人民的内战。如果有人不信，请听美帝国主义者自己招供吧：（一）“协助国民政府在中国尽可能广大的地区建立它的权威”。（二）“大规模在军事方面加以干涉，援助国民党击毁共产党”。（三）“在一九四五年一直到一九四八年初秋，国民政府在人力和军备上较其对手具有显著的优势。的确，在那一时期之内，很大一部分由于我们在运输、武装和补给上给予他们的部队的援助，他们遂能推广其控制及于华北和满洲的大部分”。（四）“马歇尔元帅希望，他的在中国，将鼓励中国非共产党区域的自由分子，较过去有力地发扬他们的力量并对反动分子和黩武分子所实施的专制发生一种发酵的作用。马歇尔元帅留在中国，直到国民大会完成了他的工作”。（五）魏德迈建议：“并请求将满洲置于五强的监护或托管之下”。（六）美国所能走的唯一另一条路，是为一个已经失掉它的人民的信心的政府全面干涉。此种干涉需要化费甚至比迄今为止无效果地用去的钱还要多的费用，需要由美国军官指挥国民政府的军队，并可能由美国武装部队——陆、海、空——参加，因而发生的战争”。此外我们不该忽略美帝最近在进行的一个更露骨的新侵略，即就是它借口“在对日和约签订前，台湾仍是日本领土”的鬼话，要吞并中国台湾省，作为美帝在中国最后的一块殖民地。所谓“不干涉中国内政”，“尊重中国领土的完整”，不是打自己嘴巴吗？美国这种强盗集团，当然要受到中国人民的反对，美国人民的谴责，和全世界有人心的人类的唾弃。
    美帝国主义者为什么要援助国民党企图击毁共产党呢？因为中国共产党能干、肯争气。如果有人不信，请听美帝国主义者自己说吧：中国共产党“在中国是政治组织最严密，纪律最良好，具有最强大效率及建设性之团体。”（美国国务院发表的对于白皮书的补充材料“中国共产党运动”，下条亦同）这是美帝国主义者被迫而漏出来的一句实话。
    “人民多向共产党一方面……许多中间党派也表示出宁愿与共产党合作，而不愿与国民党合作的趋势。”这又是被迫而漏出来的一句实话。
    如果美国真象他所声明的，讲“道义”，讲“友谊”，讲“民主”，那么，中国有了这么一个政治组织最严密，纪律最良好，是有最强大效率及建设性的，又是全中国人民和许多民主党派所拥护的中国共产党，它就该替中国庆幸，为什么反倒要击毁它呢？正因为共产党好，美帝国主义者才要击毁它。因为有了共产党，中国就有救！因为有了共产党，美国就不能把中国当作菲列宾！反过来说，美帝国主义者为什么始终支持并且现在依然支持蒋介石匪帮呢？因为蒋介石匪帮，是它们的走狗，是反人民的，反共的。请听美帝国主义者自己说吧：“在新四军事件以后的几年内……重庆政府便逐渐不愿以其最好的部队用于抵抗日本。（请注意：国民党所谓抗日原来如此）……许多重庆政府的军队或者国民党的部队甚至参加伪军，在日军的支持下攻击共产党。（请注意：这就是国民党与日伪合流的证据。）……”从美帝国主义的嘴里，无可奈何地招供出：正因为蒋介石匪帮是堕落的、腐败的，不抵抗日寇的、屠杀爱国人民的、中间党派和无党无派人士所强力谴责的、反人民的、美帝国主义才看中了它，用全力支持它；正因为中国共产党是良好的，富有建设性的、爱国的、抵抗敌人的、爱护民众的、各民主党派和无党派人士愿意与之合作的、中国人民所全心拥护的，美帝国主义者才把它当做死敌，妄想击破它。美帝国主义者企图灭亡中国的行为还不够明显吗？别上了白皮书的当，以为美帝国主义者失了眼，现在在谴责国民党的无能、不争气。不是的，国民党并不是中途变坏的，是美帝国主义者故意挑上一个坏的。白皮书谴责国民党只是向国内的反对派推诿责任罢了。是“打在儿身痛在娘心”，替国民党再打一枚强心针吧了。有能的、争气的中国人一定不肯卖国，你不肯卖国，它要你干么？美帝国主义的用心还不够明白吗？
    蒋介石匪帮已给中国人民的力量打垮了，美帝国主义者已经承认“我们的援助一直无效”，“为美国政府控制所不及”，那么，它就该死了心吧。然而不然。帝国主义不侵略等于狗不吃屎。“天性”如此，无法改变。美帝国主义者还要招募“民主个人主义者”，替它服役。所谓“民主个人主义者”，照票面看来当然是指对旧民主主义或英美式的民主主义存着幻想的一批人。这种人，中国确是有的，中国人民自然还须加以警惕，但在全国人民广大的团结之下，这等个人主义者必然在逐步改造之中；要是固执不化，脱离群众，甘心为美帝国主义的走狗，背叛祖国，结果必定灭亡。美帝国主义的幻想不过是一个泡影吧了。
    靠战争发财的美国资本家，靠剥削殖民地和半殖民地过活的帝国主义者，最怕的是反侵略、反剥削、反法西斯、同情各国人民的民族独立和人民民主运动、保障世界和平的苏联。倒向民主和平的力量增加一分，就是帝国主义者侵略的力量削弱了一分。美帝国主义者眼看拥有四万万七千五百万人口的中国基本上获得了革命胜利，而且毫不含糊地表示倒向苏联，加入了世界和平的阵营，它怎么能不痛哭流涕撒赖骂街呢？
    我们为什么倒向苏联呢？因为我们要民主、要独立、要自由、要和平。我们为什么不倒向美帝国主义呢？因为我们不愿意做殖民地的奴隶，不愿替法西斯打仗，不愿拥护人吃人的制度！今日摆在我们面前的只有两条路：一条是死路，就是以美帝国主义者为首的侵略路线；一条是活路，就是以社会主义的苏联为首的和平路线。
    美帝国主义者一贯的是侵略中国的强盗，直到今天，还在勾引所谓“民主个人主义者”，派遣第五纵队来破坏中国的革命和建设，扶植日本军阀再向中国进攻。苏联呢，十月革命以来一向做了中国的朋友，它以平等待我，它不干涉中国内政，它对我们正义的斗争表示同情，它对我们革命的胜利表示欢迎。“中国悠久文明”使中国人民知道“以德报德，以直报怨”。我们必然坚决地反对一切的帝国主义者，联合以平等待我的苏联，共同奋斗的。
    中国革命的胜利是依靠中国人民自己斗争的力量，是依靠全世界人民反帝反侵略的客观形势，可并不曾得到过苏联的飞机、大炮、军舰、坦克、军火、金圆。连马歇尔也声明苏联并未援助共产党，白皮书也不能举出苏联援助解放军的任何一个证据。那么，“外国控制中国”，“苏联统治中国”，“为苏联利益服役”等撒赖骂街的话怎么解释呢？原来美帝国主义者把“非美国的”都称为“外国”，“非美国统治的”都称为“苏联统治的”。因此，凡是拥护中国共产党，参加或赞成反美反蒋的中国人民，都叫做“外国”，都叫做“苏联”。谁都知道现在控制中国的（除待解放区外）统治中国的，是中国共产党所领导的中国人民，而不是美帝国主义者，美帝认为就是“外国控制中国”，“苏联统治中国”。这就是美帝国主义者逻辑！
    白皮书是美帝国主义不打而招供了它的本质是个十足的侵略者，所以他的对华政策基本原则，是“包括门户开放主义，尊重中国行政和领土的完整，以及反对任何外国控制中国等”；这是他已确定地把中国做他的殖民地，才敢大胆地侮辱我们。我们就这白皮书来看，尽管这样颠倒是非，可是它已经暴露出一些值得我们永远记住的事实，就是：（一）美帝国主义者对华的一贯政策是要把中国变做它的殖民地。（二）美帝国主义者的侵略政策与中国的以及一切爱好民主自由、独立、和平的人民大众的利益是无法调和的。（三）美帝国主义者与中国的以及各国的反动卖国政府是狼狈为奸的；与中国的以及各国的共产党及劳苦人民大众是势不两立的。（四）美帝国主义者决不会自动地退出中国。（五）美帝国主义者即使完全被中国人民的力量赶出中国，还要用各种毒辣手段来破坏我们的建设的。因此，我们必须做到下列的几件事情：
    （一）我们必须在中国共产党领导之下，团结一致，彻底肃清蒋介石匪帮残余势力，并击毁任何敢于出来与人民为敌的民主个人主义者。
    （二）我们必须在中国共产党领导之下，毫不动摇地“联合世界上以平等待我之民族，共同奋斗”。
    （三）我们必须坚决地与帝国主义作斗争，把一切帝国主义者赶出中国去。
    （四）我们必须加紧学习马列主义和毛泽东思想。
    （五）我们必须学习苏联建国的经验，克服一切困难，做到劳资合作、城乡互通，发展生产，繁荣经济，建设以工人阶级为领导的以工农联盟为基础的新民主主义的新中国。
