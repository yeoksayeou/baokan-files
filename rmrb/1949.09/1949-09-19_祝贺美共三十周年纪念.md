　　The Communist Party USA and the progressive American people united around it are celebrating the 30th anniversary of the CPUSA with unparalleled enthusiasm. This is a militant demonstration in the face of the increasingly intensified external aggression and internal repression by reactionary forces in the United States. The Chinese people extend their warm congratulations on the 30th anniversary of the CPUSA's struggle.

　　At a time when imperialist warmongers are stretching out their bloody claws everywhere, and world peace is facing a major threat, we on this side of the Pacific are particularly pleased to hear that the heroic American communists, representing the American working class and the American people, are vowing to block the path of imperialism, fascism, and the war camp on the other side of the Pacific. We, the Chinese Communists and the Chinese people, will respond to this great oath with continuous efforts to jointly strangle the bloody hands of the warmongers on both sides of the Pacific!

　　Currently, American imperialist schemers, led by Truman and Acheson, are actively preparing to provoke a new world war in Western Europe and the Far East with vicious, cunning, and despicable means. They are busy with farces such as the "Western European Union," the "North Atlantic Treaty," and the "Pacific Union," dreaming of escaping the irreparable capitalist economic crisis and enslaving the countries of the world, and have been universally opposed and resisted by the people of all countries. Within the United States, these reactionary dark forces are cruelly plundering the working class and depriving the people of all "democratic" rights in various ugly and shameless ways, in order to suppress the just and progressive movements of the American people. They are busy with things like the "House Un-American Activities Committee," and recently illegally arrested and interrogated twelve leaders of the Communist Party USA and the American working class, and organized rogue fascists to attack the concerts of black singer Robeson. The American people are waging a heroic and unyielding struggle against these. All of this fully exposes that American imperialism is the common and vicious enemy of the people of the world and the American people, and that the struggle waged by the Communist Party USA and the American people is inseparable from the struggle of the people of all countries for peace and democracy. The victorious struggle waged by the Chinese people has crushed the heinous rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries fostered by American imperialism, and won national independence and freedom, and is also inseparable from the encouragement and assistance given to us by the Communist Party USA and the American people. Similarly, the victory of the Chinese people will undoubtedly greatly enhance the fighting will of the American people.

　　Today, thanks to the solidarity of the world's peace and democracy forces led by the Soviet Union, the strength of the world's people is so strong that all the despicable and evil conspiracies of American imperialism in Europe and the Far East are doomed to failure or will surely fail. The international situation is extremely beneficial to the struggle of the American people for domestic peace and democracy. The heroic actions of the Communist Party USA and the progressive American people, who, regardless of the persecution of the Truman reactionary government, "fight against the growth of American fascism, fight for international peace and democracy, and fight for the rights of workers and the rights of the people at home," are by no means isolated. "The future of the United States does not belong to the outwardly strong but inwardly weak American reactionary forces, but to you and the American people."

　　祝贺美共三十周年纪念
    美国共产党和团结在她周围的美国进步人民，正以无比的热情庆祝美共三十周年纪念。这在美国反动势力日益加紧其对外侵略和对内高压的今天，是一个战斗性的示威。中国人民谨以热烈的心情，祝贺美共战斗的三十周年纪念。
    当着帝国主义战争贩子们正在到处伸出它们的血爪，世界的和平正遭受着重大威胁的时候，我们在太平洋的这一边，特别高兴听见在太平洋的那一边，英勇的美国共产党人，代表着美国工人阶级和美国人民，宣誓要堵塞帝国主义、法西斯主义及战争阵营的道路。我们中国共产党人和中国人民将以继续不断的努力，响应这个伟大的誓言，在太平洋两岸，共同扼住战争贩子们的血手！
    目前，以杜鲁门、艾奇逊为首的美国帝国主义野心家们，正以凶恶、狡诈、卑劣的手段，在西欧和远东积极准备企图挑起新的世界战争。他们正忙着搞什么“西欧联盟”、“北大西洋公约”、“太平洋联盟”等等把戏，梦想摆脱无可挽救的资本主义经济危机，奴役世界各国，并已遭到世界各国人民的普遍反对与抗击。在美国国内，这些反动黑暗势力则以各种丑恶与无耻的方式，残酷掠夺工人阶级，剥夺人民的一切“民主”权利，以压制美国人民正义的进步的运动。他们正忙着搞什么“非美活动调查委员会”，最近更非法逮捕与审讯美国共产党与美国工人阶级的十二位领袖，组织流氓法西斯分子袭击黑人歌唱家罗伯逊音乐会。对于这些，美国人民正进行着英勇不屈的斗争。这一切，充分暴露了美帝国主义是世界人民和美国人民共同的凶恶敌人，美国共产党与美国人民所进行的斗争，是与世界各国人民为和平与民主的斗争分不开的。中国人民所进行的胜利斗争，打垮了美帝国主义所豢养的国民党反动派的罪恶统治，赢得了国家的独立和自由，也是与美国共产党与美国人民的斗争所给予我们的鼓励和援助分不开的。同样，中国人民的胜利，无疑也将大大增强美国人民的斗争意志。
    今天，由于以苏联为首的全世界和平民主势力的团结一致，世界人民的力量是如此强大，以致使美帝国主义在欧洲、在远东的一切卑鄙的罪恶阴谋都归于失败或必将失败，国际的形势对美国人民争取国内和平与民主的斗争是极为有利的。美国共产党和美国进步人民，不顾杜鲁门反动政府的迫害，“为反对美国法西斯主义的增长而斗争，为国际和平与民主而斗争，为国内的工人权利及人民权利而斗争”的英勇行动，绝对不是孤立的，“美国的未来，不属于外强中干的美国反动势力，而属于你们和美国人民。”
