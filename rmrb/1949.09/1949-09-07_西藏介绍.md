An Introduction to Tibet

Tibet is an inseparable part of China's territory. From Lanzhou, which has just been liberated, to Tibet, there is a relatively flat road through Xining, Haihe, and Erling Lake, which takes about 40 days. Alternatively, you can reach Tibet from the southwest of Xining by climbing over the Tanggula Mountains, or from Chengdu into Xikang. The mountains are very high, but the journey is shorter. Most of the commercial exchanges between the Northwest and Tibet take the first, flatter route.

Tibet covers an area of 905,000 square kilometers and is the world's largest plateau, known as the "Roof of the World." It connects to Central Asia in the west and to India across the Himalayas in the south. When Buddhism was introduced to China during the Tang Dynasty, it first entered Tibet. The exact population is unknown, with estimates ranging from one million to 3.7 million. The residents are mostly Tibetans, who practice Lamaism, and mainly live in the narrow valley along the Yarlung Tsangpo River. Tibet is divided into three parts: Ü-Tsang (Front Tibet), Tsang (Back Tibet), and Ngari. Lhasa, in Ü-Tsang, is the political, religious, cultural, industrial, and commercial center of Tibet. To the north of the city is the Potala Palace, a 13-story temple that is 100 meters high, where the Dalai Lama resides. Nearby is a Buddhist university with 7,000 students. The main town of Tsang, Shigatse, is located at the confluence of the Yarlung Tsangpo River and the Nyang River. The Tashilhunpo Monastery, with a circumference of about three li, is the residence of the Panchen Lama.

Due to the inconvenient transportation between Tibet and mainland China, the Manchu Qing Dynasty and the Kuomintang reactionaries have always adopted erroneous policies of national oppression against the Tibetan minority. Therefore, imperialism has been able to carry out continuous aggression. After the British imperialists occupied Sikkim, a vassal state of Tibet, in 1860, they sent troops to invade Tibet in 1887. In 1904, they formed the "Younghusband Expedition" and invaded Lhasa, forcing the Tibetan authorities to sign the "Lhasa Convention," infringing upon Tibetan sovereignty. In 1910, when the Dalai Lama fled Tibet for India, the British imperialists took the opportunity to demand that China allow them to send troops to "protect overseas Chinese." In 1911, when the Xinhai Revolution broke out, the British instigated upper-class Tibetans to issue a "declaration of independence" and demanded that our country recognize the "Outer Tibet" (including the part of Tibet near India, including Shigatse and Chamdo) as "fully autonomous." After 1935, the British further expanded their aggressive organization in Tibet, the British Mission, doing everything possible to sow discord and engage in espionage.

After World War II, American imperialism also began actively plotting to invade Tibet. Through the Kuomintang reactionary traitorous government, they openly or secretly sent spies into Tibet, colluding with some upper-class Tibetan rulers, attempting to gain control over Tibet. This conspiracy orchestrated by British and American imperialism and their running dog, the Nehru government, further demonstrates their covetousness and intensified aggression against Tibet.

### 西藏介绍

　　西藏介绍
    西藏是组成中国的版图的不可分离的部分。从刚获得解放的兰州去西藏，有一条经过西宁、海河、鄂陵海等地较为平坦的道路，行程约须四十天；另外从西宁西南向爬过唐古拉山，或从成都入西康也都可以到西藏，路上山很大，但路程却近一些。西北与西藏间的商业往来，大半都是走第一条较平坦的大路。
    西藏面积九十万五千方公里，是世界第一大高原，有着世界屋脊之称。西通中亚细亚，南越喜马拉雅山脉可通印度。唐代佛教传入中国时，即首先传入西藏。人口确数不详，有谓一百万，有谓三百七十万者，居民多藏族、信奉喇嘛教，主要居住在沿雅鲁藏布江的狭长河谷地区。西藏区分为前藏、后藏、阿里三部分，前藏的拉萨是西藏的政治、宗教、文化、工商业中心。市北有高达百公尺的十三层大庙——布达庙，达赖喇嘛就住这庙里。附近有一所七千人的佛教大学。后藏首邑在雅鲁藏布江与年楚河合口处名日喀则，扎布伦布庙周约三里，是班禅的住地。
    由于西藏与中国内地交通不便，满清及国民党反动派一向对西藏少数民族采取错误的民族压迫政策，所以帝国主义得以进行连续不断的侵略。英帝国主义在一八六○年侵占了西藏的外藩哲孟雄（锡金）以后，一八八七年曾派兵侵略西藏；一九○四年，又组成“杨赫斯本远征队”侵入拉萨，强迫西藏当局与英签订“拉萨协定”，侵犯西藏主权；一九一○年，西藏达赖喇嘛出奔印度，英帝又乘机向中国要求允许英帝出兵“保护侨民”；一九一一年辛亥革命爆发，英帝唆使西藏上层分子发动“独立”宣言，并要求我国承认“处藏”（包括日喀则与察木多在内的靠近印度部分）“完全自治”；一九三五年以后，英帝更在西藏扩充其侵略机构——英国使团，极尽挑拨离间与间谍活动之能事。
    第二次世界大战后，美帝国主义也开始积极地图谋侵略西藏的活动，通过国民党反动卖国政府公开地或秘密地派间谍进入西藏，勾结西藏一些上层统治分子，企图取得对西藏的控制权。这次英美帝国主义及其走狗尼赫鲁政府的制造的阴谋事变，更表现了它们对西藏的进一步垂涎与加紧侵略活动。
