Short Commentary

　　The Liberation of Xining
　　Our People's Liberation Army, with its mighty hundreds of thousands of soldiers, marched westward, advancing into Gansu and Qinghai with irresistible force. On the 26th of last month, they liberated Lanzhou, the capital of Gansu Province. Only ten days later, news of victory arrived: the liberating army had liberated Xining, the capital of Qinghai Province, on the 5th.
　　Xining was the military and political center where the Kuomintang bandit gang and the Ma bandit Bu Fang had long carried out cruel rule. It is located on the south bank of the Huangshui River, with city walls about five kilometers in circumference. The city is densely populated with merchants. Large quantities of leather, wool, livestock, and medicinal materials are exported through here, and fabrics, porcelain, sundries, and other goods are imported through here. It is also the largest distribution center for goods in Qinghai. With the liberation of Xining, the people of all ethnic groups in Qinghai, who have long suffered under the tyranny of the Ma bandits, will, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, begin to build a democratic, free, happy, and prosperous life. In particular, the Hui, Tibetan, and other minority ethnic groups, who account for nearly half of the one and a half million people in Qinghai Province, can now be liberated from the suffering of oppression and enslavement for more than two thousand years. The Chinese Communist Party's policy on minority ethnic groups can be fully implemented, eliminating all ethnic discrimination and oppression, and fully developing the infinite creativity of all ethnic groups, striving to jointly build a new Qinghai.

　　西宁解放
    我人民解放军雄师数十万长驱西进，挺进甘肃青海，势如破竹，上月二十六日解放甘肃省会兰州，相隔十天，捷报传来，解放大军已于五日解放青海省会西宁。
    西宁是国民党匪帮及马匪步芳长期残酷统治的军事、政治中心，地当湟水南岸，城垣周约五公里，全市商贾密集，大宗皮革、羊毛、牲畜、药材等，经此输出，布匹、瓷器、杂货等经此输入，亦为青海货物集散之最大都会。西宁解放了，久受马匪蹂躏的青海各族同胞将在中国共产党领导下开始建设民主自由幸福繁荣的生活，尤以占青海全省一百五十余万人民近半数的回藏等少数民族，从此可以解脱二千余年来被压迫奴役的痛苦，完全实现中国共产党少数民族政策，摆脱一切民族歧视和压迫，充分发展各族人民的无限创造力，为共同努力建设新青海而奋斗。
