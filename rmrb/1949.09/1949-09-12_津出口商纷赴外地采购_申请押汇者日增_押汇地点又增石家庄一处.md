　　Tianjin Exporters Flock to Other Places for Procurement

    [Tianjin News] With the native product season approaching and new goods about to be launched one after another, exporters in this city have been applying for inter-port acceptance financing and procurement loans to go to other production areas to purchase native products. From the 1st to the 9th of this month, companies such as Dalai, Renren, and Shengda have successively borrowed more than 70 million yuan from the Bank of China for acceptance financing to purchase export native products such as sausage casings and fresh eggs in Zhangjiakou, Jinan, and other places. Shijiazhuang has recently been added as another location for inter-port acceptance financing. Yesterday, a transaction of 7.8 million yuan was also made, which was Shengda Egg Factory in this city purchasing fresh eggs in Shijiazhuang. In recent days, more than ten companies, including Daming Company, China Chemical Company, and Zhitong Trading Company, have applied to the Bank of China for procurement loans to go to other places. The first loan was finalized on the 8th for Zhitong Trading Company, which mortgaged goods such as straw braid and leather to obtain loans to purchase grey fox pelts for export in the Jining area. Another loan was finalized on the 9th for Sichuan Livestock Company, which also went to Jining to purchase grey fox pelts. The terms of both loans are one month.
