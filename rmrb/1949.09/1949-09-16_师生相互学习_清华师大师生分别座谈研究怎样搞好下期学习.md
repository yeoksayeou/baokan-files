Teachers and Students Learn from Each Other
　　Tsinghua and Normal University Teachers and Students Hold Separate Forums to Study How to Improve Learning in the Next Semester
    [Report from this newspaper] On the evening of the 11th, over a hundred teachers and more than two hundred students from Tsinghua University held a forum in the main dining hall. First, the assembly listened to typical reports from three departments, then teachers and students expressed their opinions. Three department heads—Zhuang Qianding of the Department of Mechanical Engineering, Cao Benxi of the Department of Chemical Engineering, and Zhang Wei of the Department of Civil Engineering—all spoke about their experiences and how they are preparing to organize teacher-student teaching groups to plan and promote the next semester's learning in each class. Zhuang Qianding also spoke about ways to unite teachers and students, and Cao Benxi further proposed that teachers take the initiative to connect with students, citing moving examples of how teachers in the Department of Chemical Engineering care about students' lives and organize teams to challenge students to promote their health. Finally, Academic Dean Zhou Peiyuan spoke, which can be considered a summary. He pointed out that the "buyer-seller relationship" between teachers and students is a product of capitalist society. In the new democratic society, teachers and students should unite and love each other, learn from each other, and use department meetings to further unite. He also proposed that political study should implement the spirit of New Democracy in every study, calling on teachers and students to plan their homework well for the next semester and arrange their time well so that students can learn political studies well.
    In the group discussions, teachers and students eagerly spoke. Talking about teacher-student connections, a professor from the Department of Civil Engineering said, "We can't afford to play ball with students like the Department of Chemical Engineering, but we think that teachers should study political classes with students next semester and connect with them ideologically, which will definitely be better than them." They also talked about living with students and solving specific difficulties for students. For example, slide rules in the engineering college used to rely on American goods, but now they have been successfully made domestically, costing only twenty catties of millet, which is ten times cheaper than domestic products. Regarding department meetings, most groups believed that today's report clarified the central task of leading teaching, and they talked about how to organize teaching groups to specifically plan and promote teaching. The forum did not end until late at night. (Tsinghua Correspondent Group)
    [Report from this newspaper] The Chinese Communist Party branch of Normal University invited teachers and students to hold a forum at 8 a.m. on the 13th. Attendees included the school affairs committee, administrative heads of various departments, and department heads. Chairman Liu Mingzhe explained that the purpose of the conference was to study how to combine New Democracy learning with the characteristics of the school—cultivating educational talents; and hoped to review the past with the spirit of mutual teacher-student assistance and teaching each other, and re-establish correct teacher-student relationships, teaching methods, and teaching attitudes. At the meeting, teachers enthusiastically spoke, putting forward their own opinions and views. Li Jinxi, chairman of the school affairs committee, pointed out: To build a new education, it is necessary to transform and absorb the rational parts of the old education. He encouraged the teachers who grew up in the old society to humbly learn from the students in order to better transform themselves. He explained that the past methods of teaching divorced from reality and the unplanned nature of curriculum arrangements seriously harmed the effectiveness of education. This semester, teaching methods and materials should be improved according to the principle of combining theory with practice. Professor Ye Dingyi analyzed the basic differences between the teacher-student relationship under the old education system and the New Democracy education policy. He emphasized the need to ensure that the learning content is in line with government policies. When reviewing the past teacher-student relationship, Zhang Yunbo, the librarian, said: "In the future, teachers and students should combine in business." Academic Dean Fu Zhongsun proved with his many years of teaching experience that the new educational achievements are based on the unity of teachers and students and mutual learning. Li Dequan introduced the situation of Soviet education in conjunction with practice. Next semester, Normal University will develop teaching materials and methods that combine theory with practice. At this meeting, Huang Guozhang, Dean of the School of Science, put forward specific suggestions for the geography department's study plan to implement active teaching, a study group leader system, and strengthen internships. Hou Wailu also suggested that the Communist Party branch mobilize party members to guarantee the completion of learning tasks. The conference ended successfully at 12 o'clock.

　　师生相互学习
  　清华师大师生分别座谈研究怎样搞好下期学习
    【本报讯】十一日晚上，清华大学上百位师长和两百多同学，在大饭厅举行座谈会。首先大会听取了三个系级的典型报告，接着先生同学纷纷发表意见。三位系主任——机械系庄前鼎、化工系曹本熹、土木系张维，都讲了许多经验，和正准备如何组织师生教学小组，计划并推动各班下期学习的情形。庄前鼎又讲了些师生团结的办法，曹本熹更提出要先生主动去连系同学，并举出化工系先生们如何关心同学生活，并组织球队向同学挑战，以促使同学注意健康等令人感动的例子。最后教务长周培元讲话，可算一个总结。他指出师生的“买卖关系”是资本主义社会的产物，在新民主主义社会中，师生应该团结友爱，教学相长，运用系务会议来进一步的团结起来。他并提出政治学习应做到贯彻新民主主义精神到每一学习中去，号召师长和同学好好计划下学期功课，好好安排时间，使同学的政治学习能学好。
    分组座谈了，先生同学们争着发言。谈到师生连系，土木系教授说：“象化工系那样和同学赛球，我们吃不消；可是我们觉得下学期政治课师长应和同学一起学习，从思想上连系起来，一定比他们更好。”他们还谈到应该和同学生活在一起，并替同学解决具体困难。例如工学院的计算尺，以前靠美货，现在已自制成功，只要二十斤小米，比国货都便宜十倍。关于系务会议，大部分小组都认为今天的报告中明确了以领导教学为中心任务，纷纷谈到如何组织教学小组具体计划并推进教学。座谈会直到深夜始散。　　　　　　　　　（清华通讯组）
    【本报讯】中共师大支部十三日上午八时邀请师生举行座谈会。出席的有校务委员会，学校各部行政负责人及各系主任。主席刘明哲说明大会目的是研究如何把新民主主义学习和本校的特性——培养教育人材结合起来；并希望以师生互助、教学相长的精神检讨过去，重新建立正确的师生关系、教学方法与教学态度。会上各位先生踊跃发言，提出自己的意见和看法。校务委员会主席黎锦熙指出：建设新教育，要改造并吸取旧教育中合理的部分。勉励在旧社会里成长起来的先生们要虚心向学生学习，借以更好的改造自己。他说明过去脱离现实的教法及课目安排的无计划性是严重危害了教育效果。在今学期要根据理论结合实际的原则去改进教法及教材。叶丁易教授分析了旧教育制度及新民主主义教育方针下师生关系的基本区别。他强调要注意使学习内容和政府政策配合起来。检讨到过去师生关系的时候，图书馆长张云波说：“今后师生要在业务上结合起来。”教务长傅种孙以自己多年教学经验证明新的教育成果是建立在师生团结互相学习的基础上。李德全介绍了苏联教育与实际配合的情形。师大下学期将开展理论与实际结合的教材教法。在这个会上，理学院院长黄国璋对于地理系的学习计划提出实行积极教学与学习班长制度、加强实习的具体意见。侯外庐并建议中共支部发动党团员保证学习任务的完成。大会于十二时完满结束。
