Xinhua News Agency, Northwest Front, 2nd: The People's Liberation Army units, victoriously pursuing the fleeing bandit armies of Ma, earnestly implemented the various policies and disciplines of the People's Liberation Army, receiving a warm welcome from the Hui compatriots in the new areas. When a unit of the People's Liberation Army camped in a certain place, the Hui people busied themselves vacating houses for the troops, boiling water, and helping to cook meals. When the machine gun company of the second battalion of the 46th regiment of a certain unit camped in a certain village, because there were few houses, they bivouacked in the courtyard. The landlord, Ma, insisted that the soldiers go to the house to rest. After being politely declined, he brought a lot of wheat straw for the soldiers to lay on. In the middle of the night, fearing that the soldiers would catch a cold, Ma quietly took out his own quilt and covered the soldiers with it. The Hui and Han people of Gansu are deeply resentful of the tyrannical rule of the Ma bandits and their countless crimes of grabbing grain, conscripting men, and raping women. The Hui people call the Ma bandits "religious bandits." Wherever the People's Liberation Army arrives, the Hui and Han people come to accuse them. On August 2nd, when Ma's bandit cavalry eighth division fled to Erwanli Village in Qin'an County, the residents of this village were all Hui people. The Ma bandits searched every household and took away everything that could be carried away. Ma Cungui's wife did not escape in time and was gang-raped by several bandit soldiers. Before leaving, the Ma bandits also arrested many young men from the village. When another unit of Ma bandits fled from Longde City on August 2nd, they set fire to all the more than 1,000 dan of wheat stored in the four granaries in the city. Ahongs in mosques in Longnan, Qingshui and other places have held meetings one after another to condemn the tyrannical crimes of the Ma bandits and wrote letters to Ahongs in mosques in various places and Hui people in various places, calling on them to welcome and help the People's Liberation Army to eliminate the Ma bandits. This kind of atrocity by the Ma bandit army forms a sharp contrast with the strict discipline of the People's Liberation Army and its respect for the local Han and Hui people. All soldiers universally and strictly abide by the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention of the People's Liberation Army and the various regulations that should be paid attention to when entering Hui areas. All soldiers do not enter mosques, do not enter people's houses casually, do not borrow things indiscriminately, and use the gaps in fighting to help the Hui people harvest wheat.

　　西北新区回胞
  　热烈欢迎我军
  　爱护我军战士有如亲人
    【新华社西北前线二日电】乘胜猛追两马匪军的解放军各部，认真地执行了人民解放军的各种政策与纪律，受到新区回民同胞的热烈欢迎。解放军某部在某地宿营时，回民都忙着给部队腾房子，烧开水，帮助作饭。某部四十六团二营机枪连在某村宿营时，因为房子少，在院子里露宿，房东马老汉一定要战士们去屋里休息，经婉言辞退后，他就给战士们抱来很多垫铺的麦草。半夜里马老汉怕战士们受凉，又把自己的被子拿出来，悄悄地给战士们盖上。甘肃回汉人民对马匪的暴虐统治及其抢粮、抓丁、强奸妇女的无数罪行，痛恨万分，回民都称马匪为教匪。解放军所到之处，回汉人民都纷纷前来控诉。八月二日，马匪骑八师逃窜至秦安县的二万里村，这个村里的居民都是回民，马匪挨户进行搜索，把任何可以带走的东西，都搬走一空。村民马存贵之妻未及逃走，被匪军数人轮奸。马匪临走时，还抓走了该村许多壮丁。另部马匪八月二日自隆德城逃跑时，将该城四座粮库所存小麦千余石全部放火烧毁。陇南清水等地的清真寺阿訇都纷纷集会，一致声讨马匪暴虐罪行，并写信给各处清真寺阿訇及各地回民，号召他们欢迎和帮助人民解放军消灭马匪军。马匪军的这种暴行正与解放军的纪律严明，尊重当地汉回人民的情形形成一鲜明对照，解放军各部普遍地严格遵守解放军的三大纪律八项注意和进入回民地区应注意的各项规定，所有战士都不进入清真寺，不随便进入民房，不乱借用东西，并且利用战斗空隙时间，帮助回民割麦。
