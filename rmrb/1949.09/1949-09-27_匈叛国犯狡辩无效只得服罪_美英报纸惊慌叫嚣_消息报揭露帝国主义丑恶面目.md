Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 25th: TASS, Moscow -- The News Bulletin published an article by Lev Slavinsky on the 23rd, titled "Spies and Their Masters." Commenting on the trial of the Hungarian traitor case, it stated: "The trial of the traitor case in Budapest has stimulated the British and American newspapers as if a stick were poked into an anthill." Now that Rajk has been exposed, the "concern" shown by the American intelligence agencies for Rajk and his accomplices has been written down by American journalists. One cannot help but think that their pens are being directed by Allen Dulles. The main trump card, uniformly created by these "affectionate" gentlemen, is this: Why did Rajk and his gang confess to everything and not insist on their beliefs during the trial? But the whole world knows that it is only in another kind of trial that the defendant will insist on his position, namely, the bourgeois court's trial of the Communist Party.

The author pointed out that the defendants confessed, as the prosecutor said at the Budapest trial, "because they have been exposed, because they know that denial will not help them." They hope to win some leniency by their confessions. But there is no price to bargain with the people. The people's court is not a stock exchange. As for the works of their American defenders, they may be estimated in dollars.

Dollars, subversion, and assassination—these are the weapons used by the world's reactionaries in their struggle against all nations. It is not democratic Hungary that sends spies and assassins to the United States, but the opposite; it is not the people's democratic countries that attempt to overthrow the President of the United States, but the opposite; it is bought murderers who attempt to assassinate Rakosi and shoot Togliatti, and not assassination and shooting towards Dulles and Churchill.

Conspiracy is irrelevant to communists, whose strength lies in the truth and the support of the broadest masses of the people. When a regime enjoys the support of the people, neither open attacks nor secret conspiracies can overthrow it. But when a regime is supported by bayonets, it is doomed to perish. Tito has been completely defeated in his secret war against democratic Hungary, against the camp of democracy and socialism.

　　匈叛国犯狡辩无效只得服罪
  　美英报纸惊慌叫嚣
    消息报揭露帝国主义丑恶面目
    【新华社北平二十五日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：二十三日消息报发表列夫·斯拉文的“间谍及其主子”一文。评论匈牙利叛国案的审讯称：布达佩斯审讯叛国案对英美报纸的刺激，就象棍子插到蚁穴里一样。拉伊克既已被揭露，美国谍报机关对拉伊克和他的同伙所表现的“关怀”就为美国新闻记者所写下来了。人们不禁想到他们的笔是被艾伦·杜勒斯所指挥的。这些“多情的”绅士所创造出来的千篇一律的主要王牌是这样的：为什么拉伊克和他的一伙对一切都服罪而不在审讯时坚持他们的信仰呢？但是全世界都知道，只有在另一种审讯中被告才会坚持其立场，那就是资产阶级法庭对共产党的审讯。
    作者指出，被告之所以服罪，正如检察官在布达佩斯审讯时所说：“因为他们已被揭发，因为他们知道否认对于他们并没有什么帮助。”他们希望由他们的供认来赢得某些宽大。但与人民是没有价钱可讲的。人民法庭不是股票交易所。至于他们的美国辩护者的作品，倒是可能以美金来估计的。
    美元、颠覆行动和暗杀——这些就是世界反动派在其反对世界各民族的斗争中所使用的武器。并不是民主的匈牙利派遣间谍和刺客到美国，而是相反的情形；不是人民民主国家企图推翻美国总统，而是相反的情形；是被收买的谋杀者企图暗害拉科西并向托格里亚蒂开枪，而不是暗害和枪击向着杜勒斯和邱吉尔。
    阴谋是与共产党人不相干的，共产党人的力量在于真理和最广大的人民群众的支持。当政权享有人民的支持时，不论公开的攻击或秘密的阴谋都推翻不了它。但当政权为刺刀所支持的时候那就注定了要灭亡。铁托在其反对民主的匈牙利、反对民主和社会主义阵营的秘密战争中，是完全被击溃了。
