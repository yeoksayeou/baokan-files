　　[Beijing News] The Beijing soap industry has decided to try joint sales. After the preparatory committee of the industry's trade association was established, it immediately sought to improve business operations and improve quality. It was decided to conduct a one-month trial of joint sales in October. The location has been selected at 96 Yizi, Xidan North Street. Thirty-two factories are participating, with a total of more than one hundred brands of soap. The selling price is based on the wholesale price of each factory, which is 10 to 20 percent cheaper than the market price. In terms of improving quality, the preparatory committee of the industry's trade association has sent soap samples from more than sixty factories to the Industrial Laboratory for testing. All tests will be completed today (29th), and standard quality will be set based on the test results so that each factory can produce according to the standard.
