Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, 21st - A frontline reporter reports on the liberation of Pingtan Island, stating: After the liberation of Fuzhou, the Kuomintang bandit army's 73rd Army headquarters, along with the 238th Division, fled in disarray to Pingtan Island, attempting to use the isolated island to blockade Fuzhou and defend Taiwan. Bandit chieftain Chen Cheng even personally went to Pingtan on September 13th to convene a meeting of senior military officers, deploying a plan for a desperate defense. However, three days later, this delusion of the bandit army was completely shattered under the attack of the powerful and valiant People's Liberation Army.

Following the Fuzhou campaign, the People's Liberation Army overcame difficulties from continuous operations and swiftly launched an offensive against the island groups along the Fujian coast, from Dalian Island and Xiaolian Island in the north to Caoyu in the south, and Pingtan Island. On the 13th, it first captured Xiaolian Island, annihilating a company of the 712th Regiment of the bandit's 238th Division. At 7:00 PM that evening, it continued its attack on Dalian Island. Although hindered by a hurricane during the advance, with follow-up troops unable to land in time, the vanguard troops that had already landed, facing a situation of overwhelming enemy numbers and a disparity in strength, highly developed the spirit of independently completing tasks and fighting bravely and tenaciously. After a day of fighting, the island was finally liberated at 5:00 PM on the 14th, completely annihilating a battalion of the 712th Regiment and two battalions of the 714th Regiment of the defending enemy, capturing alive the bandit army's 714th Regiment Commander, Chen Lei, and over 800 others. Another unit of the People's Liberation Army captured Caoyu at 7:00 PM on the evening of the 13th, annihilating an enemy platoon. By this point, the satellite islands surrounding Pingtan Island had all been captured by the People's Liberation Army, and the enemy defending the island was completely isolated.

On the evening of the 15th, the People's Liberation Army launched an attack on Pingtan Island, breaking through the enemy's front-line positions at 8:00 PM that evening and rapidly advancing into the depth. At 2:00 AM on the morning of the 16th, our army liberated Pingtan County, and the battle was completely concluded by 10:00 AM. The majority of the defending enemy was annihilated, with only a small number fleeing across the sea in disarray.

Pingtan Island is 70 li long from north to south and over 30 li wide from east to west, and is the largest island along the Fujian coast. It has a population of 100,000. Under the Kuomintang bandit gang's oppressive collection of exorbitant taxes and levies, the people have been in a state of poverty and starvation for years. In May of this year, the people of the island once rose up in resistance, cooperating with the people's guerrillas to break into the bandit county government. After the bandit 73rd Army scurried to the island, they again plundered supplies and grain on a large scale, and abused the people. Before the liberation, many people broke through the bandit army's blockade and secretly went to the mainland, requesting the People's Liberation Army to quickly eliminate the bandit army and rescue the people.

　　跨海解放平潭岛
    【新华社福建前线二十一日电】前线记者报道解放平潭岛的经过称：福州解放后，国民党匪军七十三军军部率二三八师狼狈逃窜平潭岛上，妄图凭借孤岛，封锁福州，防守台湾。匪首陈诚并于九月十三日亲至平潭召集高级军官会议，部署死守。但三天之后，匪军这一迷梦即在强大英勇的人民解放军的攻击下完全粉碎了。
    人民解放军继福州战役后，克服连续作战中的困难，迅速对福建沿海北起大练岛、小练岛南至草屿的岛屿群及平潭岛展开攻势。十三日首先攻占小练岛，歼匪二三八师七一二团一个连。当晚七时，继续向大练岛攻击，前进途中虽为飓风所阻，后续部队未及登陆，但先头登陆之少数部队，在敌众我寡兵力悬殊情况下，高度发扬了独立完成任务与勇猛顽强作战的精神，奋战一天，十四日下午五时，终于解放该岛，全歼守敌一三八师七一二团一个营、七一四团二个营，生俘匪军七一四团团长陈磊以下八百余。解放军另部则于十三日晚七时攻占草屿，歼敌一个排。至此，平潭岛外围卫星岛屿均被解放军占领，该岛守敌完全陷于孤立。
    十五日晚，解放军对平潭岛发起攻击，当晚八时即突破敌前沿阵地，并迅速向纵深发展。十六日晨二时，我军解放平潭县城，上午十时全部结束战斗。守敌除小部渡海溃窜外，大部就歼。
    按平潭岛南北长七十里，东西三十余里，为福建沿海第一大岛。人口十万。在国民党匪帮苛捐杂税榨取压迫下，人民历年处于贫困饥饿的苦境。今年五月间该岛人民曾一度起而反抗，配合人民游击队突进匪县府。此次匪七十三军窜踞该岛后，复大肆掠夺物资粮食，虐待人民，解放前曾有不少人民突破匪军封锁，潜赴大陆，要求人民解放军迅速前往消灭匪军，拯救人民。
