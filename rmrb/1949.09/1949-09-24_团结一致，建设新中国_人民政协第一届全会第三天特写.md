　　Unite as One, Build a New China
    ——A Feature on the Third Day of the First Plenary Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference

    Let the whole world know the strength of our unity.
    The unity expressed by the representatives of the Chinese people at the Political Consultative Conference heralds a bright and glorious future for the new China. The three great historical documents – the Draft Organizational Law of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the Draft Organizational Law of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, and the Draft Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference – concentrate the will of the people of the whole country. Every word sparkles with the hopes and ideals of the people, giving the Chinese people endless strength to build a new China.
    The more we are in victory, the more we are in times of joy and happiness, the more we infinitely cherish the heroes who are fighting hard, shedding blood, and sacrificing themselves on the front lines. When General Liu Bocheng stated that the Second Field Army is coordinating with the brotherly units of the national field army to ensure the complete annihilation of the remaining enemies in the Southwest and South China, and when General Su Yu spoke of annihilating the enemies in the Zhoushan Islands and Fujian in the shortest possible time, and making every effort to complete the liberation of Taiwan in a short period, the applause was like surging waves. These words were especially heard by the Taiwan representatives, representing 6.7 million people of Taiwan, and representatives from other areas awaiting liberation. Their applause was particularly warm, and their hearts were particularly concerned. Now that a strong and happy new China has arrived, people naturally abhor the remaining darkness even more, and the expectation of victory is even more urgent.
    The urgent welcome of the birth of the new China is the unanimous demand of the people of the whole country. Special representative General Fu Zuoyi, who just returned from Suiyuan, feels the same way. Therefore, in Suiyuan, Chiang Kai-shek telegraphed General Fu Zuoyi, still wanting to drag him back to the wrong side of history. But General Fu Zuoyi resolutely refused him and rushed back to Beiping to attend the CPPCC meeting. At the meeting, General Fu Zuoyi said he was extremely happy, shouting loudly, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Commander-in-Chief Zhu!" Chiang Kai-shek should know this situation. This is Fu Zuoyi's answer to him, and it also shows that the power of unity is constantly growing.
    People from all walks of life across the country are united around the three great historical documents, and everyone has a bright future. I have seen the close unity of the various democratic parties, and I have heard the speeches of representatives from all sides, all of which are loyal oaths to the new China. Of the sixty articles in the Draft Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, sixteen are related to the economy. In the Draft Organizational Law of the Central People's Government, sixteen of the thirty-one departments belong to finance and economics. The new country attaches so much importance to economic construction, which brings broad avenues to national industrialists and businessmen. Regarding the new democratic, that is, national, scientific, and mass education policy in the Draft Common Program, educators expressed their willingness to support these three great documents with practical actions to cultivate thousands of new Chinese construction talents. Representatives from the literary and art circles solemnly declared: National literary and art workers will definitely wholeheartedly support the three major documents and do their best to use various forms of art to conduct propaganda and education for the people of the whole country. The story of the Soviet psychologist Pavlov, as told by Liang Xi, the chief representative of natural science workers, reminded people of the suffering of the young socialist country after the October Revolution, which suffered the armed intervention of sixteen countries and famine. At that time, Pavlov himself grew vegetables next to the laboratory to feed the animals used in his experiment. His home was twelve kilometers away from the research room, and he rode his bicycle back and forth every day at the age of seventy. Lenin and Gorky took care of his life, but Pavlov declined the government's assistance to him personally. This noble spirit of self-denial is a good example for each of us. In this regard, General Su Yu also expressed touching opinions. He said: "We should try our best to overcome difficulties, be satisfied with maintaining the minimum living standards, and regard 'contributing more and enjoying less' as the supreme glory of our revolutionary soldiers." The common goal of serving the people is the guarantee of our eternal unity.
    The three historical documents submitted to the congress for approval guarantee the unity of the people of the whole country, and the unity of the people of the whole country will surely guarantee the rapid progress of our great motherland. With the foundation of these three major documents, the construction work of our new China will surely be like what Representative Tao Menghe said: "We should strive to complete the long road that others have taken in two hundred years in twenty years."

　　团结一致，建设新中国
    ——人民政协第一届全会第三天特写
    陆灏
    让全世界都知道我们团结的力量。
    中国人民的代表在政治协商会议上表示的团结，昭示着新的中国灿烂辉煌的前程。中国人民政治协商会议组织法草案、中华人民共和国中央人民政府组织法草案和中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领草案三个伟大历史文献，集中了全国人民的意志，每一个字闪烁着人民的希望和理想，中国人民由此得到了建设新中国的无穷无尽的力量。
    越是在胜利中，越是在快乐和欢跃的时候，人们对于前线艰苦作战流血牺牲的英雄们，更显得无限的怀念。当刘伯承将军表示第二野战军正在与全国野战军弟兄部队协同作战，保证一定能够彻底消灭西南、华南的残敌的时候，当粟裕将军谈到当于最短时间，歼灭舟山群岛和福建的敌人，尽一切努力于短时期内完成解放台湾的任务的时候，掌声犹如波涛翻腾，这些话，特别为代表六百七十万台湾人民的台湾代表和其他待解放区的代表听到，他们的掌声显得格外热烈，心情也格外关注。当强盛的、幸福的新中国已经来到，人们对于那残留的黑暗自然就格外厌恶，对于胜利的期待也就更加迫切了。
    迫切的欢迎新中国的诞生，是全国人民一致的要求。刚从绥远回来的特邀代表傅作义将军也是如此，因此，在绥远，蒋介石打电报给傅作义将军还想拖他走历史的回头路，但傅作义将军坚决拒绝了他，赶回北平参加政协会议。在会上，傅作义将军说他高兴极了，大声的喊着毛主席朱总司令万岁，这种情形应该让蒋介石知道。这就算是傅作义将军给他的回答，这也表示团结的力量在不休的增长。
    全国各阶层人民团结在三个伟大历史文献的周围，每一个人都有光辉的前途。我见到了各民主党派的紧密的团结，我听到的各方面代表的发言，都是对于新中国忠诚的宣誓。人民政治协商会议共同纲领草案六十条条文，其中有十六条是有关经济的，中央人民政府组织法草案里面，三十一个部门有十六个是属于财经方面的，新的国家如此重视经济建设工作，这给民族工商业家带来了广阔的道路。共同纲领草案关于新民主主义的，即民族的、科学的、大众的新中国教育方针，教育工作者表示愿意以培养千万个新中国的建设人材的实际行动拥护这三个伟大的文献。文艺界代表则郑重宣告：全国文艺工作者一定全心全意拥护三大文件，尽最大努力，用各种文艺形式，对全国人民进行宣传和教育。自然科学工作者首席代表梁希所说的苏联心理学家巴夫洛夫的故事，使人们回想到十月革命以后，年青的社会主义国家遭受十六国武装干涉和饥荒的痛苦，那时候的巴夫洛夫，在实验室旁，自己种菜，喂养他试验所用的动物，家离研究室十二公里，以七十高龄天天骑自行车往返奔跑，列宁托高尔基照顾他的生活，但巴夫洛夫辞谢了政府对他个人的资助。这种崇高的克己的精神，对于我们每一个人，都是一个很好的榜样。在这方面，粟裕将军也发表了动人的意见。他说：“我们当想尽办法，克服困难，以维持最低生活为满足，并以‘多贡献，少享受’为我们革命军人无上的光荣。”愿为人民服务的一致目标，就是我们永远团结的保证。
    提交大会通过的三个历史的文件保证了全国人民的团结，全国人民的团结，必将保证我们伟大祖国的飞速前进。我们新中国建设工作有了这三大文件的基础，一定会象代表陶孟和先生所说的一样：“我们应该努力在二十年里走完人家在二百年里所走的长路。”
