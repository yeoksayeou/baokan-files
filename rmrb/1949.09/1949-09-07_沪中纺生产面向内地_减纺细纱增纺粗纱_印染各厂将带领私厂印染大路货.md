　　Shanghai China Textile Production Focuses on the Mainland
  　Reducing Fine Yarn Spinning, Increasing Coarse Yarn Spinning
    Printing and Dyeing Factories Will Lead Private Factories in Printing and Dyeing Mass-Market Goods
    [Special Dispatch from Our Shanghai Correspondent on the 6th] The China Textile Company is actively changing its production policy and has formulated a plan to reduce fine yarn spinning and increase coarse yarn spinning; and to print and dye mass-market goods. Of the China Textile Company's seventeen cotton textile factories, in addition to the number of spindles required for spinning 32-count and 42-count warp and weft yarns, the remaining 240,000+ spindles are planned to be gradually converted to spinning 20-count yarn. The first phase involves converting 120,000 spindles, to be completed in two stages. The first stage involves converting 64,000+ spindles, planned for completion in September. Currently, the actual number of spindles in operation in all cotton mills is 750,664, of which 11,648 spindles spinning 60-count to 80-count yarn will be completely reduced; those spinning 32-count to 42-count will be reduced from 349,920 to 285,768; those spinning 20-count to 23-count will be increased from 361,372 to 449,896; and those spinning 16-count and below will be reduced from 27,724 to 15,000. The printing and dyeing factories have formulated their production plans for September, requiring them to lead private factories in promoting the conservation of dyeing materials, not dyeing fabrics in excessively deep colors, and not competing on color. This will not only save dyeing materials and reduce costs but will also indirectly increase the purchasing power of the working people.

　　沪中纺生产面向内地
  　减纺细纱增纺粗纱
    印染各厂将带领私厂印染大路货
    【本报记者上海六日专电】中纺公司积极进行改变生产方针，已订出计划，减纺细纱，增纺粗纱；印染大路货。中纺十七个棉纺织厂，除纺三十二支、四十二支经纬纱所需锭数外，余二十四万余锭，拟逐步改纺二十支纱。先改十二万锭，分两期完成，第一期改六万四千余锭，计划九月内完成。现全部棉纺厂实际开工锭数为七十五万零六百六十四枚，其中纺六十支到八十支纱锭计一一六四八枚全减；三十二支到四十二支者，从三四九九二○枚减至二八五七六八枚；二十支到二十三支者，从三六一三七二枚，增至四四九八九六枚；十六支以下从二七七二四枚减至一五○○○枚。印染各厂已订出九月份生产计划，要求做到领导私营厂推动染色原料节约运动，不染色泽过深的布，不以色泽作竞争。这样不但可以节省染色原料，减低成本，同时间接提高了劳动人民的购买力。
