Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 10th: Warsaw dispatch: Polish farmers are celebrating this year's harvest festival in a joyful atmosphere. The characteristic of the festival is the participation of workers from industrial centers, demonstrating the increasing consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance. In Warsaw and Danzig, 100,000 workers and peasants participated in the joint celebration, in Krakow there were 200,000 participants, and in Silesia nearly 300,000 people participated in the celebration. Slogans were posted everywhere, celebrating the friendship between the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies, calling for the consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance, calling for the fight against backwardness in the countryside, for increasing agricultural production, and for further development of competition.

This year's harvest in Poland was slightly delayed due to unfavorable weather, but under the government's call, a large number of urban workers and young people participated in the harvest work. The harvest committees established this year also helped farmers lacking animal power to rent machinery, greatly solving their difficulties. A total of 1,824 tractors, 280 binding machines, 125 tractor-drawn harvesters, 6,124 horse-drawn binding machines, 5,000 horse-drawn harvesters, and 5,600 threshing machines, etc., were available for farmers to use. The combined harvesters supplied by the Soviet Union were used for the first time this year on Polish state-owned farms. Agricultural labor competition was widely launched throughout the country. As of August 20, more than 42,000 production teams with 768,000 people have been organized throughout Poland; by the end of this year, this number of teams will increase to 60,000. Ninety percent of individual agricultural producers participated in the labor competition, ensuring that they greatly exceeded the figures stipulated in the plan. The results of this year's harvest are very good. The wheat harvest of individual farms reached 1,500 kilograms per hectare, while state-owned farms reached 1,850 kilograms.

After the victorious completion of the harvest, the sowing of winter crops of rye, wheat, and barley began in early September. Polish Minister of Agriculture Koziol said: Poland's arable land has increased by 300,000 hectares, and 6.15 million hectares of land will be sown with winter crops this year. Nearly 40,000 tons (9,000 tons more than last year) of selected seeds and nearly 100,000 tons of artificial fertilizers have been distributed to farmers. Sowing will be completed in October. The government is now providing farmers with short-term credit loans of 1.26 billion zlotys to purchase seeds, fertilizers, and rent agricultural machinery. The Polish Ministry of Agriculture is now facing the major task of further mechanizing agriculture. Significant achievements have been made in this area. There are currently nearly 3,000 district machinery and tractor centers and approximately 4,000 branch stations serving farmers' farms.

　　波庆祝收获节
　  大批工人青年参加收割冬季播种定十月里完成
    【新华社北平十日电】华沙讯：波兰农民在欢乐的气氛中庆祝今年的收获节。节日的特色是工业中心的工人也来参加，表现工农联盟日益巩固。在华沙和但泽均有十万工农参加了联欢大会，在克拉科有二十万人，在西里西亚则有将近三十万人参加庆祝。到处都张贴着标语，庆贺苏联和人民民主国家的友谊，号召巩固工农联盟，号召为反对农村的落后、为增加农业生产和进一步发展竞赛而斗争。
    今年波兰收割因气候不佳稍有迟延，但在政府号召下，大批城市工人和青年参加了收割工作。今年成立的收割委员会，也帮助缺乏畜力的农民租用机器，大大解决了他们的困难。共有一千八百二十四辆拖拉机，二百八十架捆谷机和一百二十五架拖拉机曳引的收割机，六千一百二十四架马拉捆谷机，五千架马拉收割机，和五千六百架打谷机等供农民使用。苏联供给的复合收割机今年第一次在波兰国有农场上使用。农业劳动竞赛在全国广泛展开。至八月二十日止，波兰全国业已组织了有七十六万八千人的四万二千余个生产小组；到今年年底，这种小组将增加到六万个。有百分之九十的个体农业生产者参加了劳动竞赛，保证他们大大地超过计划所规定的数字。今年收获的成绩甚好。个体农场小麦收获量达每公顷一千五百公斤，国营农场则达一千八百五十公斤。
    收获胜利完成后，冬季作物裸麦、小麦和大麦的播种已在九月初旬开始。波农业部长科齐奥尔称：波兰可耕面积已增加三十万公顷，今年将有六百一十五万公顷的土地播种冬季作物。有近四万吨（比去年多九千吨）的选种和近十万吨的人造肥料分配给农民。播种将在十月里完成。政府现正贷予农民十二亿六千万兹罗提的短期信用贷款，以便购买种子、肥料和租用农业机器。波兰农业部现正面临着使农业进一步机器化的重大任务。在这一方面已获重大的成就，目前已有将近三千个区的机器和拖拉机中心站与大约四千个分站，为农民们的农场服务。
