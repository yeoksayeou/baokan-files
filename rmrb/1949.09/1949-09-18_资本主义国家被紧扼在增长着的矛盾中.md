Title: Capitalist Countries Are Being Crushed in Growing Contradictions

The bankruptcy and decline of the capitalist system has never been as blatant and prominent as it is now.

The Second World War has further sharpened the general crisis of capitalism. Four years have passed since the end of the war, but the countries ruled by the bourgeoisie have become increasingly and hopelessly mired in a web of economic and political contradictions, imperialist antagonisms, and social conflicts.

The United States, the primary country in the imperialist camp and now the center of world reaction, is the source of economic chaos and the hotbed of political corruption in all countries ruled by the bourgeoisie. The American economy has been hit by all the fatal diseases of the current decadent and parasitic capitalism. In the face of an inevitable and approaching new economic crisis, what is the meaning of the fabricated ravings about "prosperity"? The American ambitionists, who try to arrogantly act as the masters and trustees of almost all nations in their quest for world hegemony, turn out to be despicable and hopelessly bankrupt in their own country. American industry, even in the post-war period, has not reached 80 percent of its wartime peak production, and has been declining since the end of 1948. In the first half of 1949, its production fell by 13 percent, which is exactly the same as in the first six months of the 1929-1933 crisis. This is not just an ominous coincidence, but a cold warning about the countless new disasters that the selfish rule of monopoly capital has imposed on the American people.

The growing economic crisis has subjected millions of men and women to severe poverty. In the United States, approximately six million people are completely unemployed, and more than twelve million are partially unemployed. In many industrial areas, the number of unemployed accounts for a quarter of the total number of workers.

The economic crisis is plunging the Marshall Plan countries of Western Europe into the abyss. The failure of the Marshall Plan is a fact that even its most ardent supporters cannot deny. For a few dollars, the Western European bourgeoisie sold out the national interests of their countries to Wall Street, and the money they received was not even enough to plug most of the loopholes. On the contrary, the Marshall Plan has made Western European countries subject to the control of the dollar, and has destined them to follow the fate of the American economy step by step.

The noisy advertising of "European economic recovery" is merely a shameless swindle. While the Soviet Union has exceeded its pre-war industrial output by two-fifths and is moving forward on a path of strong and genuine growth, and while the people's democratic countries have successfully completed the restoration of their national economies and have far surpassed the pre-war level, the economies of Western European countries are limping along, not even reaching the level of the crisis year of 1938, and have been declining throughout 1949.

The current crisis will inevitably be a particularly deep one. It is hitting countries that have been weakened by the war and its consequences. It is developing in a situation where capitalist exploitation has become narrower due to the separation of the people's democratic countries from the imperialist system, and is continuing to shrink due to the unstoppable growth of the national liberation movement in the colonial world.

In the capitalist countries of Western Europe, the first blow of the crisis has already caused a serious decline in the people's living standards and a growing unemployment rate. In the Western occupied zones of Germany, the number of unemployed is approximately 1.5 million. Italy's army of unemployed has reached three million, and, as the official Roman News Agency admits, unemployment "has taken on the nature of an organic phenomenon in Italian economic life." In tiny Belgium, the number of unemployed has exceeded 300,000. In France, there are hundreds of thousands of unemployed. The United Kingdom, the second most important capitalist country, is unable to escape the quagmire of the continuous crisis of its entire economic system.

As the crisis grows, the infighting within the imperialist camp inevitably becomes more acute. The fierce struggle for markets doubles the centrifugal forces in the imperialist camp. Although the Anglo-American bloc acts as a united front against democracy and progressive forces, it is torn apart by the sharpest contradictions. Anglo-American antagonisms in the Near East and Middle Eastern dependencies have openly taken on a more obvious and acute form. In order to distribute American "aid," the governments of the Marshallized countries are ready to pounce on each other and strangle each other at any time.

Such is the bleak picture presented by the current capitalist economy. Marx's indignant words about the bourgeoisie, which is so weak that it is even unable to guarantee a slave's life to its hired slaves, have never resonated so prophetically as they do today.

On the basis of the currently decaying economic foundation of capitalism, there have arisen adventurous plans to forcibly establish an Anglo-American imperialist world hegemony and extremely reactionary cosmopolitan conspiracies aimed at eliminating the national sovereignty of all countries. In all aspects of political life, the most extreme forms of reaction and ignorance are growing on this basis. On this basis, the culture of the bourgeoisie is gradually disintegrating.

What can the bosses of capitalist countries offer to the people who long for peace, work, bread, and freedom? Not peace but mad preparations for a new war, not work but unemployment, not bread but bullets to greet striking workers, not freedom but rampant terror to suppress the working class and all progressive forces. The reactionary imperialist bloc is attempting to find a way out of the growing crisis by indulging in the arms race, inciting war hysteria and poisoning the international atmosphere, by intensifying exploitation and continuing to lower the living standards of the working people, and by violently suppressing the growing resentment of the broad masses.

However, this policy pursued by the ruling camp is not only anti-people, but also reckless and absurd. It is becoming clearer day by day that this policy can only lead to results that are the exact opposite of what the masters of the current capitalist countries expect. Because the increasing international tension and the arms race are making the economic chaos even more serious. Lowering living standards will further shrink the market. Brutal police repression can never suppress the resentment of the masses, but on the contrary, will only increase it to the maximum extent. The daily resistance of the people against the rule of monopoly capital and its obedient ministers, and against the cannibalistic conspiracies of the new war instigators, is growing. The solidarity of the proletariat is growing and becoming more seasoned. The resistance of the broadest masses against the warmongers is continuing to increase. The people of Western Europe emphatically declare that they will never allow their children to be cannon fodder for those man-eating guys across the ocean, and will never allow their historically long-standing countries to become battlefields for atomic bombs. The mass demonstrations against the North Atlantic aggressive treaty in countries such as France and Italy, the protest letters signed by millions of people, and the huge scale of the world peace movement—all of this is a stern warning to those who intend to play with fire.

Therefore, real life itself proves with its countless facts that there is a great distance between the war instigators' adventurous plans and the realization of these plans. The peace camp, headed by the great Soviet state and supported by the people of all countries, is stronger than the camp of war.

Almost twenty years ago, Comrade Stalin pointed out that along with the capitalist economic system, there exists a socialist system. The socialist system is growing and flourishing, it opposes the capitalist system, and it points out the decline of capitalism and shakes its pillars by the very fact of its existence.

Since then, the socialist national economic system of the Soviet Union has grown to a magnificent scale. Today, following the example of the Soviet Union and with the strong support of the Soviet Union, the people's democratic countries have embarked on the road of building socialism. The people of the Soviet Union and several countries in Central and Southeastern Europe have eliminated all the terrible scourges of capitalism, such as crises, unemployment, and disastrous production anarchy. The people of the entire capitalist world clearly see that these terrible scourges of capitalism can be eliminated, but only by eliminating the capitalist system itself.

The peaceful and creative efforts of the Soviet people are redoubling the power of the great socialist country. The Soviet people feel honored because their victories in this area have inspired millions of fighters for liberation from the shackles of capitalism, giving them new strength and perseverance. The Soviet people, under the leadership of the great Stalin, are marching towards the brilliant peak of communism, and firmly believe that the future belongs to the workers.

### 资本主义国家被紧扼在增长着的矛盾中

　　资本主义国家被紧扼在增长着的矛盾中
    资本主义制度的破产和没落，从来没有象目前这样露骨而突出。
    第二次世界大战已使得资本主义总危机更加尖锐化。战争结束业已四年，但是，资产阶级统治的国家，却变得越发绝望地深陷于经济政治矛盾、帝国主义对立和社会冲突的罗网中。
    帝国主义阵营中的首要国家，现在已成为世界反动中心的美国，就是经济混乱的渊源和资产阶级所统治的一切国家政治腐化的温床。美国经济受到了当前腐朽透顶的寄生性资本主义一切致命疾病的打击。在新的经济危机无可避免地迫近着的情况下，伪造的关于“繁荣”的呓语有什么意义呢？力图妄自尊大充当几乎一切民族的主子和托管人的美国的争夺世界霸权的野心家，原来是卑鄙下贱而且在他们自己国内无可挽救地破产了的。美国的工业，在战后时期甚至没有达到战时生产最高峰的百分之八十，自一九四八年底以来又一直在下降。一九四九年上半年，它的生产下降了百分之十三，这正好和一九二九——一九三三年危机的开头六个月时期一样多。这不仅只是一个不祥的巧合，这是关于垄断资本自私统治所加诸美国人民的无数新灾难的冷酷警告。
    成长着的经济危机，使千百万男女遭受严酷的穷困。在美国，完全失业的人已约达六百万，部分失业的人已超过一千二百万，在许多工业区，失业人数竟达工人总数的四分之一。
    经济危机正在使西欧马歇尔化的国家坠入深渊。马歇尔计划的失败是一个事实，甚至是最热心拥护马歇尔计划的人也无法否认。西欧资产阶级为了几块美元就把他们国家的民族利益出卖给华尔街，而所得的一点钱，却甚至不足以堵塞大部漏洞。相反的，马歇尔计划使西欧各国受美元的驾御，使他们注定了只好跟随着美国经济的命运亦步亦趋。
    “欧洲经济恢复”的喧嚣的广告，其结果只是无耻的骗局。在苏联已经超过战前工业产量五分之二并正在强大而且确实的高涨途中向前迈进的时候，在人民民主国家已经成功地完成了国民经济的恢复工作而把战前的水平远远抛在后面的时候，西欧各国的经济却是一跛一跌地还没有爬到一九三八危机年度的水平，而在一九四九年就已一直在往下滚了。
    目前的危机，必将是一个特别深重的危机。它打击为战争及其后果所削弱了的国家。它是在这种情况下发展起来的，即：资本主义的剥削，由于人民民主国家脱离帝国主义体系而更加狭窄，而且由于殖民地世界之民族解放运动的无可抑制的增长还在继续缩小。
    在西欧资本主义国家，危机的第一个打击就已造成了人民生活水准的严重低落和增长不已的失业。在德国西方占领区，失业人数约达一百五十万。意大利的失业大军已达三百万，正如官办的罗马通讯社所承认的，失业“已具有了意大利经济生活的有机现象的性质”。在小小的比利时，失业人数已超出了三十万。在法国，失业者已达数十万人。其重要性居第二位的资本主义国家英国，则没有能力来脱出它整个经济制度连绵不断的危机的泥淖。
    在危机日益成长的情况下，帝国主义营垒内的互相倾轧无可避免地变得越加尖锐。争夺市场的残酷斗争，使帝国主义营垒中的离心力加倍地增大。美英集团虽然在反对民主和进步力量上有象统一战线一样的行动，但是，却被最尖锐的矛盾撕得四分五裂。美英在近东、中东附属国中的对立，公开地采取了更明显更尖锐的形式。为了分配美“援”，各马歇尔化国家的政府相互之间准备着随时扑过去扼住对方的咽喉。
    目前资本主义经济所呈现的一幅凄惨的图画就是如此。马克思所说过的关于衰弱到甚至无力为其雇佣奴隶保证奴隶生活的资产阶级的那些义愤的话语，从来没有象今天这样预言性地回响着。
    在目前资本主义的腐朽着的经济基础上，产生了武力建立美英帝国主义世界霸权的冒险计划和极端反动的以消灭各国人民的民族主权为目的的世界主义的阴谋。在政治生活各方面，反动与愚昧之极端的形式，正是在这个基础上滋长起来的。在这个基础上，资产阶级的文化正在逐渐解体。
    对于渴望和平、工作、面包和自由的人民，资本主义国家的老板们能有什么贡献呢？不是和平而是疯狂的准备新的战争，不是工作而是失业，不是面包而是对饥饿的罢工工人飨以子弹，不是自由而是镇压工人阶级和一切进步力量的猖狂的恐怖。反动的帝国主义集团企图依靠放纵军备竞赛、煽动战争歇斯底里和毒害国际气氛，依靠加紧剥削和继续压低劳动人民的生活水准，依靠横暴镇压广大群众增长着的愤恨，企图依靠这些去寻找摆脱日益成长着的危机的出路。
    但是，统治营垒所遵循的这一政策，不仅仅是反人民的，而且是鲁莽荒唐的。一天比一天明显地，这个政策只能招致与目前资本主义国家的主子们所期望的截然相反的结果。因为越来越甚的国际上的紧张局面和军备竞赛，使得经济混乱更加严重。压低生活水准会使得市场更加缩小。残暴的警察镇压，绝不能抑制群众的愤恨，相反地，只会使愤恨提高到最大程度。人民反对垄断资本的统治及其唯唯是听的部长们，反对新战争煽动者的吃人阴谋的那种日常的反抗，正在增长着。无产阶级的团结，正在壮大起来并且变得愈有锻炼。最广大群众对战争贩子的反抗，正在继长增高。西欧的人民着重声明，他们绝不让自己的子弟去替海洋彼岸的吃人成性的那些家伙当炮灰，绝不容许他们的历史悠久的国家成为原子弹的战场。法意等国反对北大西洋侵略条约的群众示威，千百万人联名提出的抗议书，世界和平运动的巨大规模——所有这一切，都是对那些意欲玩火者的严厉的警告。
    因此，现实生活本身以其不可胜数的事实证明：战争贩子的冒险计划和这一计划的实现，两者之间存在着一大距离。以伟大苏维埃国家为首，而且有着各国人民之支持的和平阵营，比战争的营垒更为强大。
    差不多在二十年以前，斯大林同志指出过，和资本主义的经济制度一起，存在着社会主义制度。社会主义制度正在长大和欣欣向荣，它反对资本主义制度，它以其存在这一事实本身指明资本主义的没落并且动摇它的支柱。
    自那时以来，苏联的社会主义的国民经济制度，已壮大为雄伟的规模。今天，遵循着苏联的榜样并在苏联的强有力的支持之下，人民民主国家已经走上了建设社会主义的道路。苏联和中欧东南欧若干国家的人民，已经肃清了资本主义所有的类如危机、失业和招致灾难的生产无政府状态等可怖祸害。整个资本主义世界的人民清楚地看到，资本主义这些可怕的祸害，是可以被消灭的，但唯有通过消灭资本主义制度本身才能做到。
    苏联人民的和平的创造性努力，正在加倍地增强着伟大社会主义国家的威力。苏联人民感到荣幸，因为他们在这方面的胜利，鼓舞了千百万为自资本主义桎梏下谋解放的战士们，给他们以新的力量和毅力。苏联人民在伟大斯大林的领导下向光芒万丈的共产主义高峰迈进中，并坚定地相信将来是属于劳动者的。
