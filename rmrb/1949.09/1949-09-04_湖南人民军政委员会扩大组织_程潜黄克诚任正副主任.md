Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 3rd - The Hunan People's Military and Political Committee expanded its organization on the 29th of last month, with Cheng Qian, Huang Kecheng, Xiao Jingguang, Wang Shoudao, Tang Shengzhi, Chen Mingren, Qiu Ao, Jin Ming, Tang Xing, Tang Tianji, Li Minghao, Zhou Li, and Yuan Ruren as members, with Cheng Qian as Chairman and Huang Kecheng as Vice Chairman. Previously, after Generals Cheng Qian and Chen Mingren led the uprising, they organized the Hunan People's Military and Political Committee with the support of the people to maintain military and political affairs during the transition period. Now that Changsha has been liberated, there is an urgent need to reorganize the uprising troops and prepare for the establishment of a formal people's government at an appropriate time. The affairs are complex, and therefore the original organization of the Military and Political Committee needs to be expanded and enriched. This expanded organization method has been implemented on the 29th of last month after consultation between the Hunan Communist Party and the Military and Political Committee, and with the approval of the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission.
