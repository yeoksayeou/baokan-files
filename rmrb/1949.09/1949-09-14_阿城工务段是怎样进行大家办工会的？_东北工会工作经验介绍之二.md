　　How the Acheng Engineering Section Conducts Union Affairs by Everyone?
　  Second Introduction to Northeast Union Work Experience
    The Acheng Engineering Section of the Harbin Railway Administration manages a line extending 144 kilometers from Xinxiangfang in the north to Yimianpo in the south. It has 20 administrative units (each administrative unit is a union central group), divided into four subsections, with a total of 607 employees, of which 515 are union members. Because the engineering section has achieved "everyone running the union," union work has developed rapidly, and administrative efficiency has also greatly improved. The process and experience of implementing "everyone running the union" is briefly introduced below:

    The Organizational Form and Several Systems of the Union

    The union committee has one chairman and one vice-chairman, and six executive committee members in charge of organization, production, labor protection, and propaganda and education. In addition, there are four executive committee members stationed in the four subsections. Each central group has three or two member groups. Each group has one group leader and one deputy group leader. Each group member (approximately 7 to 12 people) takes on a specific job, such as entertainment, sanitation, communication, merit, technology, recording merit, mutual aid, and labor protection. They are members of their group, participate in group life, but are also guided in their work by the organization, production, and other committee members, according to the nature of their work. New positions can be added according to work needs. For example, the Shelteron road maintenance team group, discovering members were tardy, elected an inspector to visit employees' homes before work; the construction factory group, when planting vegetables, had a vegetable garden person in charge.

    Member groups hold weekly review meetings to examine the advantages and disadvantages of the work and to arrange work for the following week. The persons in charge contact and promote each other, report the situation to the group leader at any time, the group leader reports to the central group leader at any time, the central group leader reports work to the executive committee members by telephone once a week, the executive committee members report to the section union at any time if they encounter problems that cannot be solved, and a joint meeting of central group leaders is held at the end of each month (with executive committee members also participating) to report the work of the month and arrange the work for the following month.

    In addition, a merit evaluation committee composed of responsible comrades from the Party, government, and union, as well as worker representatives, reviews the standards for earning merit and assesses the size of the merit. An accounting review committee composed of executive committee members and worker representatives reviews the income and expenditure of the section union once a month (the section union publishes the accounts monthly).

    Initially, Employees Had a Vague Understanding of the Union

    The section established a union as early as 1946, which was then a regional union, and after several changes, it was changed to a section union. Because the organization was very imperfect at that time and the work was not carried out on a large scale, employees had a vague understanding of the union. Some people thought that "joining the union is just paying membership fees," and that learning was just "peddling plaster"; some workers even questioned the union director: "Can learning be eaten?"

    When the section union was conveying the method of "everyone running the union" downwards, the following ideas existed among the employees:

    (1) Setting up these persons in charge is "taking off your pants to fart—superfluous," it is better to use the group leader alone. (2) I want to be a person in charge, but I don't know how to do anything, so it won't work. (3) Universally saying: "This time everyone is promoted!" is a tone of dissatisfaction.

    In response to these ideological situations, the section union committee members divided the work and went to each subsection to explain and publicize, and mobilized group leaders and activists to organize group discussions and individual conversations to conduct education. As a result, the vast majority of people's thinking was cleared. For example, the Acheng road maintenance team group, after discussion, felt that there was a lot of union work and the group leader could not take care of it alone, so everyone needed to do it. The various persons in charge were just dividing the work and being responsible, and the division of labor of the various persons in charge was just doing what they were good at, according to their personal strengths.

    After the group discussed the problems, the union committee members personally went down to explain the specific responsibilities of each person in charge, and promoted publicity with typical examples, so everyone was very satisfied to take on their responsibilities.

    Mobilizing Everyone to Run the Union Must Be Combined with the Production Merit Campaign

    Mobilizing everyone to run the union must be combined with the production merit campaign, and active members and model groups must be elected to ensure that the union is not divorced from production. The conditions for active members should not be too high or too low, because if they are too high, workers will easily be discouraged, and if they are too low, it will be impossible to distinguish between good and bad, and it will not arouse the enthusiasm of the work. Based on this situation, the conditions for active members of the section are: (1) conscientious and responsible; (2) complete their own tasks; (3) implement union resolutions; (4) enthusiastic about union work. Those who meet the above four conditions are active members, and the union will give them praise.

    Each group sets out conditions to compete with each other, and the one with good results will get the title of model group. For example, the third group of the construction factory is a model group. Not only does each person in charge play a role, but the union and administrative calls are enthusiastically responded to in the group and challenges are made to external work areas. When welcoming "May Day", the construction of the work area houses stipulated 210 workdays, and as a result, 142 workdays were completed, and two more railcars were repaired.

    After the production task is assigned, the group immediately discusses and formulates a plan. For example, after the Red May assault task is assigned, they discuss and formulate guarantee conditions.

    Everyone has work, everyone is responsible, and the work becomes active.

    After everyone runs the union, each member is responsible for their own work, the responsibilities are clear, and the union work becomes enthusiastically active. The members' understanding of the union and their production enthusiasm have also greatly improved. Non-members, due to the implementation of labor protection and the influence of the active situation of everyone running the union, have also become active and are requesting to join the union.

    Sanitation person in charge Cui Huating used to not care about union work. This time, he not only inspected each household and office, but also took the lead in doing it. At the same time, when he saw workers not washing their faces, he would propose corrections. Generally speaking, the sanitation persons in charge play a universal role, inspecting workers' homes, so the employees' families have also become clean. Entertainment person in charge Guan Jingying of the office's third group used to be a very shy girl. After taking on the role of entertainment person in charge, she automatically wanted to play Song Meiling in the performance of "War Criminals Seeking Peace." Liu Dianrong of the construction factory organized and rehearsed and also wrote his own scripts, and produced a play for every festival and anniversary. Zhao Huanzhang, the learning person in charge of the Acheng work area, used to teach workers the courses and then leave it at that, regardless of whether the workers understood or not. This time, he also took responsibility and had to ask about the content of the lecture every morning to ensure that the workers understood it, so the workers were willing to learn. Zhao Xianbin, the technical person in charge of the construction factory, formulated a merit plan to guarantee that he would teach two apprentices in three months. When the time came, one apprentice was officially promoted to bricklayer, and the other also made great progress. In this way, the members are all moved and feel that the union is their own home and their own school. For example, if workers at the construction factory wanted to cancel study time because of busy work tasks, the workers requested to study in the evening. The workers in Pingshan were reluctant to leave the club after work.

    Give Play to Class Friendship and Create a Wave of Mutual Assistance

    The mutual assistance situation is good. They have highly demonstrated the spirit of class friendship. Not only do individuals help each other, but also work areas help each other. What is more noteworthy is that family members help employees with their work. This all shows that the workers have a fairly high degree of class consciousness, the workers are united as a family, and the production enthusiasm is also improved accordingly. The workers who are on business trips are also more at ease.

    Acheng shift worker Xia Chung閣, escaped last year from Anshan in the Kuomintang-ruled area to the liberated area, the family is in difficulty, everyone automatically helps money and food, Sun Wenzhang alone aided fifty-two pounds of corn, moved to say: "Who cares if I starve to death in the Kuomintang-ruled area? The liberated area is really a worker is a family!"

    Ma Jin'ao, a worker in the Maoershan work area, took out his own money to buy paper and order notebooks for the illiterate workers to use for learning, so the illiterate workers actively learned.

    Wang Minghe and Pu Chengji, workers in the technical room, seeing that the woodworking shop was too busy, automatically helped to mark the stakes.

    Seeing that there were few people in the Yimianpo factory, the Acheng construction factory brushed all the station nameplates in the area of Yimianpo and also plastered the houses in Maoershan.

    Seeing that other departments were busy, the office organized a commando team. During the Chinese New Year holiday this year, they did not rest for three days and helped to load 78 railcars of steel rails. Their group of 18 people loaded 40 rails per car, creating the fastest record of 17 minutes.

    At the same time, the family members of the employees also helped the employees with their work. Worker Fang Mengchun mobilized his family to pull six loads of tree strips from the mountains; the Women's Federation of Xiao Jiu helped the workers unload five train cars of stones at night (according to 10 workers and 15 women, a total of ten cars were unloaded, and the five cars shared by the Women's Federation were unloaded first, and then helped the workers unload). The families of employees in Maoershan, Yimianpo, Shangzhi and other work areas helped to split wooden plugs (wooden plugs are because the rail spikes are floating, the rail spikes are pulled out, the wooden plugs are placed inside, and then nailed). All of the above demonstrates the class friendship of the workers.

    Greatly Improved Production Enthusiasm

    Because the employees are all moved, the production enthusiasm is greatly improved. When inspecting the work in February, the screws were not loose and none of the nails were floating; unloading sand at night did not exceed the train's stay time; during the Lunar New Year holiday, 63 cars of steel rails were transported to Guannei, the seven-day task was completed in three days, and no overtime pay was required; the tools produced were worth more than 100 million yuan; more than 18,000 meters of abandoned lines were removed, and 24 bridges were removed; 71 steel rails were collected, so the administrative side was awarded a special merit once in March, and the union was awarded a great merit once.

    Mobilize Members to Actively Participate in All Union Activities

    Each person in charge in the group not only mobilized everyone to participate in the activities of the union group, but also mobilized everyone to actively participate in all collective activities of the union organization, such as clubs, drama groups, singing teams, night schools, etc.… This mobilized all members to participate in all union activities, and initially realized the comprehensive "everyone runs the union".

　　阿城工务段是怎样进行大家办工会的？
　  东北工会工作经验介绍之二
    哈尔滨铁路管理局阿城工务段，所辖线路北起新香坊，南至一面坡，全长一百四十四公里，行政业务共有二十个单位（每一行政单位为一工会中心小组），全段分四个分段，共有员工六百零七人，其中工会会员五百十五人。该工务段由于做到了大家动手办工会，因之工会工作开展迅速，行政效率也大大提高。今将其实行大家办工会之经过及其经验简单介绍如下：
    工会的组织形式及几个制度
    段工会委员会有主任副主任各一人，设组织、生产、劳保、宣教等六个常务执行委员，外有四个执委分置于四个分段。每一中心小组下有三个或两个会员小组。小组有正副小组长各一人。各组组员约七至十二人都担任一定工作，如文娱、卫生、通讯、立功、技术、记功、互助、劳保等干事。在小组为小组组员，过小组生活，但又按其所担任的工作性质的不同，分别由组织、生产等各委员在业务上来指导。根据工作需要可增设干事，如舍利屯养路工区小组，发现会员有迟到现象，便选举了巡视干事，上班以前到各员工家中巡视；建筑工厂小组，在种菜的时候，设有菜园子干事。
    会员小组会，每周开一次检讨会，检讨工作中的优缺点并布置下周的工作。各干事互相联系，互相推动，有情况随时汇报小组长，小组长随时向中心小组长报告，中心小组长每周用电话向执行委员汇报工作一次，执行委员如遇有不能解决的问题时，随时向段工会报告，每月底召开一次中心小组长联席会议（执委也参加），汇报一月的工作情况，布置下月的工作。
    此外，由党政工负责同志及工人代表组织一评功委员会，审查立功标准及评论功绩大小。并由执委及工人代表组成一查帐委员会，每月审查一次段工会的收支情况（段工会每月公布一次帐）。
    起初员工对工会认识模糊不清
    该段自一九四六年即成立了工会，当时是地区工会，后经几次变更，改为段工会。由于当时组织很不健全，工作无大开展，所以员工对工会的认识是模糊不清的。有的认为“参加工会就是拿会费”，学习不过是“卖膏药”；有的工友竟质问工会主任：“学习能当饭吃吗？”
    当着段工会向下贯彻大家办工会的办法时，员工中存在以下几种思想：
    （一）设这些干事是“脱了裤子放屁—多余”，莫如用小组长一个人。（二）想自己当个干事，但自己啥也不会干，不行。（三）普遍的说：“这回都升官了！”是一种不满的口吻。
    段工会针对这些思想情况，各委员分工到各分段进行解释宣传，并发动组长、积极分子组织小组讨论及个别谈话等方式进行教育，结果绝大部分的思想打通了。如阿城养路工区小组，讨论觉得工会工作很多，小组长一人照顾不过来，需要大家来办，各干事不过是分工负责，各干事的分工不过是依个人的特长能干啥就干啥。
    小组讨论出来的问题，工会委员便亲身下去解释清楚各干事的具体责任，并以典型推动宣传，这样大家就很满意的担任起自己的责任了。
    发动大家办工会要与生产立功运动结合
    大家办工会必须与生产立功运动结合，必须选举积极会员与模范小组，才能使工会与生产不脱节。积极会员的条件既不能过高又不能过低，因为过高工友则容易泄气，过低则分不出好坏，引不起工作的积极性。根据这个情况，该段积极会员的条件是：（一）认真负责；（二）完成本身任务；（三）执行工会决议；（四）热心工会工作。够以上四条便为积极会员，由工会给以表扬。
    各组定出条件互相比赛，成绩好的便得模范小组的头衔，如建筑工厂第三小组为模范小组，不但每个干事都起作用，对工会及行政号召在小组内纷起响应进行挑战，并对外工区挑战，迎接“五一”时修建工区房屋规定二百一十个工，结果一百四十二个工就完成了，并多修出两台压车。
    该组在生产任务下来后便马上讨论订出计划，如红五月的突击任务下来后，他们便讨论出保证条件。
    人人有工作，大家负责任，工作活跃起来。
    大家办工会以后，各会员分工负责，责任明确，便把工会工作热烈的活跃起来，会员对工会的认识和生产情绪也都大大提高了一步。非会员由于劳保的实施和大家办工会活跃情况的影响，也都积极起来，要求入会。
    卫生干事崔华廷以前对工会工作不关心，这回不但检查各家及办公室而且带头去干，同时见到工友不洗脸他便提出纠正，一般来说卫生干事普遍起作用，到工友家中检查，所以员工家属也都干净起来了。事务室三组文娱干事关晶莹，以前是个很忸怩的姑娘，担任文娱干事后排演“战犯求和”自动愿意扮宋美龄。建筑工厂刘殿荣，组织排演并且自己编，每次节日纪念日都出一个剧。阿城工区学习干事赵焕章以前教工友课程时，是教过拉倒，不管工友会不会，这次也负起责任每日早晨要把讲的内容问一遍，使工友明白为止，工友也就愿意学习了。建筑工厂技术干事赵宪斌订出立功计划，保证三个月教会两个徒弟，到期一个徒弟果然正式升为瓦工，另一个也大有进步。这样会员都动起来感到工会是自己的家，自己的学校，如建筑工厂工友因工作任务忙想取消学习时间，工友们便要求在晚间学习，平山工友下班后都不愿意离开俱乐部。
    发挥阶级友爱造成互助热潮
    互助的情况是好的，他们高度的发挥了阶级友爱的精神，不但个人互相帮助而且工区与工区都是互相帮助，更值得注意的是家属帮助员工工作。这都说明了工友有了相当高的阶级觉悟，工人团结成一家，生产情绪也随之提高，出差工作的工友也更安心。
    阿城飞班工友夏春阁，是去年从国民党统治下的鞍山逃来解放区的，家庭困难，大家自动帮助钱粮，孙文章一人便援助五十二斤苞米，感动得他说：“我在国民党统治区饿死谁管呢？解放区真正是工人是一家！”
    帽儿山工区马金骜工友自己拿出钱买纸订本子，给不识字的工友作学习之用，因之不识字的工友都积极学习。
    技术室工友王明和朴成吉，见木工场忙不开，自动帮助划标桩。
    阿城建筑工厂见一面坡工厂人少，把一面坡担任区域的站名牌全都刷了，并把帽儿山的房子也刷了浆。
    事务室见别的部门活忙，便组织突击队，在今年过年时三天假都未休息，去帮助装了钢轨七十八车。他们一组十八人每车装四十根，创出十七分钟的最快纪录。
    同时各员工家属也帮助员工工作，房梦春工友动员家中上大山里拉了六趟树条子；小九妇女会晚上帮助工友卸五火车石头（按工友十人妇女十五人共卸十车，妇女会分担的五车还先卸完，又帮助员工卸的）。帽儿山、一面坡、尚志等工区员工家属帮助劈木塞子（木塞子是因道钉起浮，把道钉拔出，把木塞放里，然后再钉）。以上这些都表现了工友们的阶级友爱。
    生产积极性大提高
    由于员工都动起来，生产积极性便大大提高，二月份检查工作时，螺丝不松，钉子全部没起浮；夜间卸沙子没超过列车停留时间；旧历年假中往关内运钢轨六十三车，七天任务三天完成，不要加班加点费；生产出的工具约值一万万多元；撤废线一万八千多米，撤桥梁二十四连；搜集钢轨七十一根，所以三月份行政方面立特功一次，工会立大功一次。
    动员会员，积极参加工会的一切活动
    小组中各个干事不仅动员大家参加了工会小组的活动，还动员大家积极地参加了工会组织的一切集体活动，如俱乐部、剧团、歌咏队、夜校等………。这样把全体会员都动员起来参加了工会的一切活动，初步的实现了全面的大家办工会。
