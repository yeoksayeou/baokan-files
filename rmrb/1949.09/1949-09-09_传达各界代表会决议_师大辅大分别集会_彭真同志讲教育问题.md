　　Communicating the Resolutions of the People's Representative Conference
  　Normal University and Fu Jen University Hold Separate Meetings
  　Comrade Peng Zhen Speaks on Education Issues
    [This newspaper's report] At 3:00 PM on the 6th, Normal University held a general meeting of teachers, students, and staff in the auditorium of the First Academy to communicate the resolutions of the People's Representative Conference of Peiping Municipality by the school's representatives who attended the conference. First, student Duan Baolin reported on the resolutions of the conference, followed by Mr. Zhao Lian, Mr. Dong Weichuan, and Mr. He Luting, who reported on the situation of the conference and expressed their feelings. Mr. Li Dequan and Comrade Peng Zhen also came to participate.
    Comrade Peng Zhen specifically spoke about his views on China's current education issues. He said: China's current general policy for education is New Democratic education, which is education with a national form, scientific content, and mass character. There are two aspects to the task of education: one is to eliminate the existing feudal, comprador, and fascist ideas; the other is to build up ideas of serving the people. The biggest mistake in the past education was the disconnection between theory and practice. From now on, we study in order to use what we learn. Comrade Peng Zhen pointed out that some students at Normal University want to transfer because they believe that education is not directly participating in construction and production. This idea is wrong. He said that while science and engineering are important, education is equally important, especially since the students of Normal University will be running middle schools, primary schools, and normal schools after graduation, and will also be training many educators for China. If middle and primary schools are not run well, China cannot quickly move towards industrialization. If normal universities are not run well, the development of cultural and educational undertakings will be problematic. Finally, he affirmed: Educational work is one of the leaders of the revolution and one of the leaders of the people's thought.
    Finally, Mr. Li Jinxi, Chairman of the University Affairs Committee, gave a summary report. Mr. Li said: Normal University must combine the resolutions of the People's Representative Conference with the actual situation of the school and thoroughly implement them. At the end, he emphasized his support for the establishment of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association.

　　传达各界代表会决议
  　师大辅大分别集会
  　彭真同志讲教育问题
    【本报讯】六日下午三时，师大在一院大礼堂召开师生员工大会，由本校出席北平市各界代表会议的代表传达该会决议。首由段宝林同学报告了会议的决议，继由赵琏先生、董渭川先生、贺绿汀先生先后报告大会情况，并且发表了感想。李德全先生和彭真同志也赶来参加。
    彭真同志特别讲了他对中国目前教育问题的看法，他说：中国目前教育的总方针是新民主主义的教育，是民族形式的、科学化、大众化内容的教育。教育的任务有两方面：一是肃清现存的封建的、买办的、法西斯的思想；一是要建设起为人民服务的思想。已往的教育在方法上犯了最大的毛病，就是理论与实践脱节，今后我们学就是为了用。彭真同志指出师大有些同学想转学，认为教育不是直接参加建设生产，这种想法是错误的。他说理工重要，教育也同样重要，尤其师大的同学将来毕业是要去办中学、办小学、办师范学校，还要为中国培养许多教育工作者的。假如中小学办不好，中国就不能很快走向工业化。不把师范大学办好，文化教育事业的发展是成问题的。最后他肯定的说：教育工作是革命的领导者之一，是人民思想的领导者之一。
    最后由校务委员会主席黎锦熙先生做总结报告。黎先生说：师大一定要将各界代表会的决议和本校的实际结合，彻底实行。末了并强调拥护中苏友好协会的成立。
