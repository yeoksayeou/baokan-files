"Soldiers Acting as Soldiers"
How the 1st Company of the 136th Regiment of the Second Field Army Self-Composed and Performed

To celebrate "August 1st" (Army Day), the regiment held a grand meeting. Clerk Feng Shusen discussed it with several soldiers who had previously been involved in recreational activities. Clerk Feng suggested that the play "Four Soldiers Competing for Merit," which he had seen before, would be good to perform. Squad Leader Qin Jie said, "This play isn't about our company, and it's not our own composition, so it's not fresh!" Everyone agreed to write their own. Qin Jie had many "ideas." From "Four Soldiers Competing for Merit," he associated it with the deviation in the company's military and political studies during training. This material was similar to "Four Soldiers Competing for Merit," and everyone agreed to write about it.

Qin Jie described the general situation of the play. First, three soldiers would come on stage, each talking about the importance of their respective learning subjects, leading to an argument. Then, the political instructor would come on stage to point out the deviations and correct them. Everyone agreed, saying it would be best to perform it using clapper talk. Who would write it? It was decided to divide the work. Nie Zhaotu would write the lyrics emphasizing the importance of military affairs, Liu Wanyuan would write about politics, and Lei Hongzhu and Qin Jie would write about culture. After writing, they would ask the deputy political instructor to revise it. Deputy Political Instructor Li Hengyin pointed out a few problems with the content and suggested that it wouldn't be good to only have clapper talk in terms of form, suggesting adding some "dialogue." Everyone suggested adding a cook, so the whole company would be represented, and suggested adding some singing to make it even livelier. Everyone agreed.

They went to the division to attend a meeting on "August 1st" and didn't get to perform. The company used a game time to try out the performance. There was no stage or makeup. After the performance, everyone welcomed it and wanted to do more and compete with other companies. Some soldiers volunteered to participate, the number of actors increased, and an entertainment organization was established.

Combining class education with the upcoming march into the Great Southwest, they also created "Wang Zezhi Establishing Merit," using actual material from the company to illustrate that revolutionary soldiers should carry the revolution through to the end. After dividing the roles, everyone worked very hard. Some didn't take naps to practice, and some took care of the actors' fatigue by taking their shifts when they were on duty or on business trips. They rehearsed the play in ten days and performed it for the entire battalion, receiving praise.

The company's ability to carry out "self-composed and self-performed" recreational activities is inseparable from Deputy Political Instructor Li Hengyin and Clerk Feng Shusen. They paid attention to organizing and mobilizing the masses, participating in and guiding the writing and performance activities, and taking care of the actors. They believed that this was a good political and cultural study, and they timely persuaded those who thought "doing this is useless," and carried out this activity consistently.

　　“兵演兵”
    二野一三六团一连怎样自编自演
    为了迎接“八一”，团里开大会热闹热闹。文干冯树森便和过去搞过文娱的几个战士商量。文干提出过去看过的“四战士争功”好演，六班长秦杰说：“这剧不是咱连的事，不是自己编的，不新鲜了！”大家都同意自己编，秦杰的“点子”多，从“四战士争功”联想到练兵中本连军政处学习有偏差，这种材料和“四战士争功”差不多，大家也同意编这个。
    秦杰把这个剧的大概情形说了一下，先由三个战士上台，各说各偏重学习课目的重要，发生争论，然后由政指上台指出偏差纠正。大家同意，说最好用快板演。谁来编：确定分开编，聂肇图编强调军事重要的词，刘万元编政治的，类洪珠、秦杰编文化的，编好后，请副政指修正。副政指李恒银指出了内容的一点毛病，指出形式上光快板不好编，可加上些“道白”，大家提出再加上一个炊事员，一个连就全了，并提出再加上点唱就更热闹了。这些大家都同意了。
    “八一”到师里开会，没有演成。连里利用一个游戏时间试演了一下，没台子，也没化装，演后大家欢迎，要多搞几个，和别的连比赛比赛。有的战士自动报名参加，演员增加了，并建立了娱乐组织。
    结合阶级教育和要进军大西南，又编排了“王泽之立功”，用连里实际材料，说明革命战士要把革命进行到底。分了角色后，大家都很卖力气，有的不睡午睡练，有的照顾演员劳累，替上岗，出差。十天里排好了这个剧，给全营演，受到好评。
    连里能搞起“自编自演”的文娱活动，与副政指李恒银、文干冯树森是分不开的。他俩注意组织发动群众，参加指导编演活动，照顾演员。他俩认为这就是个好的政治、文化学习，并及时说服了个别的认为“搞这个没啥用”的说法，把这一活动贯彻坚持下去。
