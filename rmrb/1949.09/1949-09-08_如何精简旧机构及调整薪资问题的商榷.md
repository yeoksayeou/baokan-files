Consultation on How to Streamline Old Institutions and Adjust Salaries
    Yang Bo
    Currently, in our East China and Central China liberated areas, a mass movement of streamlining and thrift is widely unfolding. This is a great movement for us to overcome current financial difficulties, accelerate economic construction, and welcome the final victory of the whole country. We should quickly promote this movement to every corner of every liberated area, and streamlining and thrift should be established as an indispensable and regular system in each of our work departments from now on. Only in this way can we greatly save national expenditures, accumulate wealth for production construction, and victoriously build our free and happy New Democratic New China.
    This movement involves a wide range of issues. Here, I would like to offer a few suggestions for discussion on how to streamline the old institutions we have taken over, how to handle the old personnel, and how to adjust their salaries.
    1. How to Streamline Old Institutions and Handle Old Personnel
    Due to the political corruption and degeneration of the Kuomintang reactionaries, all their administrative institutions—from general administrative organs to every production enterprise department—can be said to have reached the peak of bureaucracy and corruption. There was no work efficiency to speak of, and the phenomenon of overlapping institutions and overstaffing was widespread. Therefore, when we take over these bloated and decayed institutions, not only should the general administrative organs be destroyed and reorganized, but every production enterprise institution must also be quickly streamlined and adjusted. Many undertakings are entirely based on individual connections and have no need to exist at all; many undertakings blindly imitate highly developed capitalist countries such as Britain and the United States, which are completely incompatible with the development of China's social economy. Therefore, it is necessary to merge what should be merged and streamline what should be streamlined according to the needs of China's social and economic development and the people's ability to bear it, in order to benefit the future development of our entire production enterprise.
    In this streamlining work, the handling of personnel must be particularly cautious. We should treat different specific targets appropriately. (1) For technical personnel and various experts in various departments, we must strive to unite them and make them feel at ease in their work. Those who are necessary for the original institutions should be retained well. If there are surpluses in the original institutions, they can be introduced to appropriate positions in other places to work and effectively utilize their talents. Even if it is impossible to place them temporarily, they should be retained as much as possible and given opportunities for research and study, so as to carry out the construction of New Democracy in the future. (2) For general administrative personnel, those who are competent in their work should be recruited separately to make them feel at ease in their work. If there is overstaffing, they can be transferred to other work. Because today, on a national scale, our cadres are not too many, but insufficient; the vast newly liberated areas in the south of the Yangtze River still need cadres, and the vast areas in South China, Southwest China, and Northwest China will soon be completely liberated, where even more cadres are needed; even in our old liberated areas in North China, due to the transfer of a large number of old cadres to the south, the various work departments in the countryside currently also need to be supplemented with a batch of cadres. Therefore, we can plan to distribute this surplus personnel in the cities to work in the new liberated areas and the countryside. This is not only beneficial to the entire revolutionary work, but also a good opportunity for these old personnel to exercise. (3) For those who are incompetent in their work and who have held such positions in the past through family connections, some can be demoted; those who are unwilling to be demoted and have no work ability and are difficult to place can only be dismissed; but they should also be given the opportunity to participate in various production labor. If they have no work ability and are unwilling to endure hardship, they can only be left to their own devices. Because today, the blood and sweat of the Chinese people do not allow us to support these idlers for nothing. (4) Finally, for the small number of reactionary special agents lurking in various organs and enterprises, except for those who have repented and are willing to atone for their sins, they must be resolutely and thoroughly cleansed. Only in this way can we strictly rectify our revolutionary ranks and improve our work efficiency. In short, the placement of old personnel is a task that we must handle with caution. We must proceed with the policy of striving for, uniting, and transforming, and conduct it with a responsible attitude, so as to ensure that everyone gets their due and is settled in their jobs, and strictly prevent any hasty and irresponsible phenomena.
    2. Salary Adjustment
    Local experience has proven that the policy of "original position and original salary" has had a great effect in the initial stage of our liberation of every city, allowing us to smoothly take over every enterprise unit. Because this can not only avoid disrupting the old enterprise institutions, but also allow the general old staff (and even some old senior staff) to avoid worries about their livelihood and adhere to their duties, so that production and business are not interrupted. But when our various takeover tasks have come to an end, and social order has tended to stabilize, we must begin to consider the old salary adjustment issue, otherwise it will affect the further development of our entire production enterprise. Because in the past, the salary system of the Kuomintang government was very unreasonable. Inheriting this unreasonable salary system will inevitably cause serious losses to our economic construction. This unreasonable salary system is mainly manifested in: (1) valuing mental labor and despising physical labor, forming a disparity in salary treatment between mental labor and physical labor. In the past, the salary of an ordinary clerk was far higher than the wage of an ordinary worker, while their labor intensity was much lower than that of workers. (2) The salaries of organs such as customs, post offices, and railways, which have close ties with imperialism, are much higher than the salaries of general organs. They live in luxury and develop the colonial slave mentality of relying on foreigners. (3) The salaries of enterprises that make more money (such as China Textile and banks) are much higher than those of enterprises that cannot make money; therefore, the salaries of light industry are often higher than those of heavy industry (such as China Textile's employees' salaries, which are on average about 50% higher than those of other factories). However, the work of general heavy industry workers is obviously more burdensome than that of light industry, and requires a higher level of technical skill. (4) Currently, the salaries of general old staff are also very unreasonable compared to the treatment of our general supply-system cadres. Of course, old staff with special skills or special experience should enjoy relatively favorable treatment; but the work undertaken by general staff is less important than that of our supply-system cadres, and if the treatment is much higher, it is too unreasonable. Currently, in the North China region, the salary of an old staff is on average equivalent to the treatment of three of our supply-system cadres, while in Shanghai it is on average equivalent to the treatment of five and a half supply-system cadres, which must be appropriately adjusted. (5) In the past, due to different salary calculation methods in various regions, the levels between regions were also very disparate. For example, the salaries in the south of the Yangtze River are calculated to be much higher than those in North China and Northeast China, which hinders our mobilization of excessive technical personnel from the Beijing-Shanghai area to work in the interior. Therefore, today we must make appropriate adjustments to the past salary system and standards, and gradually establish a new and reasonable salary system.
    China's economic development was originally very backward. After 20 years of destruction by the Kuomintang reactionaries and more than ten years of war damage, all industries have been withered, and the people are poor and the country is exhausted. Now, we must mobilize all the people to economize on food and clothing, work hard, and strive to restore and exceed the pre-war level of our industrial and agricultural production within two or three years. In order to achieve this goal, we must grasp the principle of streamlining and thrift to reform all unreasonable institutions and salary systems. Of course, such reforms will cause pain to some personnel. In the past, they relied on special relationships to enjoy special treatment; this privilege should not and cannot be preserved today. The lives of staff, like the lives of workers and farmers, should be guaranteed, and they can be guaranteed to enjoy a slightly better life than workers and farmers; but they should not be too far apart from workers and farmers. Some social insurance systems (such as retirement pensions, old-age pensions, etc.), we recognize that they are progressive; but before the entire society can implement these systems, certain organs should not be too prominent. Therefore, I think such reforms are completely reasonable and hope that people from all walks of life can adopt them.

　　如何精简旧机构及调整薪资问题的商榷
    杨波
    目前在我华东、华中两大解放区，已广泛地展开群众性的精简节约运动，这是我们克服当前财政困难，加速经济建设，迎接全国最后胜利的一个伟大运动。我们应将这一运动，迅速推广至我们每一个解放区的每一个角落里去，并应将精简节约定为我们今后每一个工作部门中的一个不可缺少的经常制度。只有如此，我们才有可能大量节省国家开支，积累资财用于生产建设，胜利的建设起我们自由、幸福的新民主主义新中国。
    在这一运动中，涉及的面是相当广阔的，这里个人仅就如何精简我们已接收的旧机构，如何处理旧人员及调整其薪资的问题，提出几点意见与大家商榷。
    一、如何精简旧机构，处理旧人员
    国民党反动派由于其政治上的腐败堕落，其一切办事机构——从一般的行政机关到每一个生产企业部门，可以说已达到了官僚、腐朽的顶点；谈不上什么工作效率，机构重叠，人浮于事的现象普遍皆是。因此当我们接收了这一些臃肿庞大、糜烂不堪的机构后，不但一般的行政机关应予摧毁整顿，而且每一个生产企业机构，亦必须很快加以精简调整。有许多事业完全是因人设事，根本没有存在的必要；有许多事业则盲目仿效英美等资本主义高度发展的国家，与中国社会经济的发展是完全不相称的。因此必须按照中国社会经济发展的需要，和人民负担能力，应合并的就合并，该精简的就精简，以利我们今后整个生产事业的发展。
    在这一精简工作中，对于人员的处理，必须特别慎重，我们应分别具体对象予以适当的安置。（一）对各部门的技术人员，各种专家，我们必须争取团结他们，使其安心工作。原机关所必需者，皆应很好留用，如原机关有多余，则可介绍到其它地方适当的岗位上去工作，有效的发挥他们的才能。即使一时无法安插，亦应尽可能保留下来，给予研究和学习的机会，以便将来进行新民主主义的建设工作。（二）一般的行政人员，凡工作能称职者，我们即应分别录用，使其安心工作。如人浮于事，则可调任其它工作。因为今天就全国范围来说，我们的干部不是太多，而是不足；江南广大新解放区的乡村中还需要干部，华南、西南、西北广大地区即将全部解放，那里需要的干部数量更多；即在我华北老解放区，亦由于大批老干部的抽调南下，目前乡村的各级工作部门，也同样需要充实一批干部。因此我们即可将这一批城市中多余的人员，有计划的分配到新解放区及乡村中去工作，这不但对整个革命工作有利，即对这些旧人员自己来讲，也是一个很好的锻炼机会。（三）凡不能胜任工作，过去是靠亲戚裙带关系而担任这样的职务者，一部分可降级使用；不愿降级及毫无工作能力很难安插的，只能遣散；但亦应给以机会去参加各种生产劳动。如果自己既无工作能力，而又不愿吃苦耐劳，那就只有听其自便。因为今天中国人民的血汗，是不容许我们白白养活这些游手好闲的人员的。（四）最后对各机关企业中潜伏的少数反动特务分子，除已改过自新，愿意戴罪立功者外，必须坚决彻底予以清洗。只有如此，才有可能严整我们的革命队伍，提高我们的工作效率。总之，对旧人员的安置，对我们来讲是一件必须慎重处理的工作，我们必须本着争取、团结、改造的方针和负责的态度去进行，务必使其各得其所，各安其业，严格防止任何草率从事，不负责任的现象发生。
    二、调整薪资问题。
    各地经验证明，“原职原薪”的政策，在我们解放每一个城市的初期，对我们顺利接收每一个企业单位，是收到了很大的效果的。因为这不但可以避免打乱旧的企业机构，而且可以使一般的旧工作人员（甚至一部分旧高级工作人员）免除生活上的顾虑，恪守职责，使生产及业务不致中断。但当我们各项接收工作已告结束，社会秩序已趋安定，需要迅速恢复与发展生产时，我们即必须开始考虑旧的薪资调整问题，否则将会影响我们整个生产事业的进一步发展。因为过去国民党政府的薪资制度，是很不合理的。继承这种不合理的薪资制度，必然会使我们的经济建设受到严重的损失。这种不合理的薪给制度主要表现在：（一）重视脑力劳动，轻视体力劳动，形成了脑力劳动与体力劳动在薪资待遇上的悬殊。过去一个普通职员的薪金，远远高于一个普通工人的工资，而其劳动强度则比工人低得很多。（二）与帝国主义有密切联系的海关、邮政、铁路等机关的薪资，比较一般机关的薪金高出很多，他们养尊处优，养成依附洋人的殖民地奴隶思想。（三）赚钱较多的企业（如中纺和银行等），其薪资远多于不能赚钱的企业；因此轻工业的薪资，往往反而高于重工业（如中纺较其它工厂的职员薪金，平均高出百分之五十左右）。但一般重工业职工的工作，是显然较轻工业繁重，且须较高的技术水准。（四）目前一般的旧职员的薪资，与我们一般供给制干部的待遇相比，也是很不合理的。当然有特殊技能或特殊经验的旧职员，应当享受比较优厚的待遇；但一般职员所担负的工作，其重要性还不如我们供给制的干部，如果待遇高得很多，那就太不合理。目前在华北区一个旧职员的薪金，平均等于我们三个供给制干部的待遇，在上海则平均等于五个半供给制干部的待遇，这就必须作适当的调整。（五）过去各地区由于薪资计算方法不同，因此地区之间高低也很悬殊。如江南的薪资，据计算高出华北、东北很多，这样就妨碍了我们动员京沪一带过多的技术人员到内地来工作。因此，今天我们对过去的薪资制度、标准，必须予以适当的调整，逐渐建立起一套新的合理的薪资制度。
    中国经济发展原很落后，经过国民党反动派二十年的摧残，又经过十余年的战争破坏，已经弄得百业凋蔽，民穷财尽。现在必须动员全体人民，节衣缩食，艰苦奋斗，努力于二三年内把我们的工业农业生产恢复并超过战前的水准。为要达此目的，我们就必须掌握精简节约原则，来改革一切不合理的机构和薪资制度。当然，这样的改革，会使部分的人员感到痛苦的，过去他们依靠特殊关系，而享受着特殊的待遇；这种特权今天不应当再保存，亦不可能再保存。职员的生活，与工人农民的生活同样应予保证，且可保证他们享受比工人农民稍为好一点的生活；但不应该与工人农民距离太远。某些社会保险制度（如退休金、养老金等），我们承认它是进步的；但在整个社会无法实行这些制度以前，某些机关亦不宜于过份突出。因此这样的改革，我想完全是合情合理的，希望社会各界人士能予采纳。
