Nine Three Society Issues Declaration
  　Exposing US-British Aggression Conspiracy
  　Urging Swift Liberation of Taiwan and Tibet
    US Imperialism Creates Excuses to Seize Taiwan
    [Reported by this newspaper] The Nine Three Society issued a declaration on September 14, denouncing the conspiracies of US and British imperialism to invade Taiwan and Tibet. The declaration stated:
    "As our liberation army liberates Fuzhou, Lanzhou, Xining, and other places, and approaches Taiwan and Tibet, the greatest enemy of the Chinese revolution—US imperialism—in addition to publishing a White Paper openly declaring that it will continue to support so-called democratic individualists as its fifth column, is also using the excuse that 'Taiwan is still Japanese territory before the signing of the peace treaty with Japan' to prepare to take over Taiwan, which was returned to China four years ago based on the Cairo and Potsdam Declarations. It is also directing its little accomplice, British imperialism, to use the reactionary regime of the Indian traitor Nehru, who has always regarded himself as the anti-communist leader in the East, to create so-called 'communist disturbance' incidents in Tibet, as a pretext to expel the Han people and invade Tibet. The Indian News Agency, representing the Indian government, and so-called 'British authorities' have even overturned history, denying China's sovereignty over Tibet, and even threatening that 'if China attempts to impose its rule on Tibet, Tibet may...seek British intervention.' Such sophistry by US and British imperialism, in addition to making us further recognize the true face of these ogre-like imperialists and increasing our vigilance, fully reveals the embarrassing situation of the imperialists themselves, who are at the end of their rope and in a flurry.
    Taiwan was originally a province of our country. Except for the Gaoshan ethnic group, which accounts for 2.5% of the province's population, all are descendants of immigrants from southern Fujian and eastern Guangdong. In 1895, the Qing Dynasty, due to its defeat in the Sino-Japanese War of Jiawu, signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding Taiwan to Japan. This was immediately opposed by the people of Taiwan, who erected the Yellow Tiger Flag and established the Republic of Taiwan, supporting Governor Tang Jingsong as president. Although the event failed, during the subsequent 51 years of Japanese rule, the people of Taiwan, unable to endure the high-pressure policies of the Japanese rulers, launched uprisings and revolts, which were countless in history. Among them, the great revolutions led by Luo Fuxing and Yu Qingfang involved hundreds of thousands of comrades, with responses throughout Taiwan. As the Japanese themselves said, "Small changes occur every three years, and major changes occur every five years." Even the Gaoshan ethnic group, regarded as ignorant and muddle-headed, once launched the Wushe Incident, which shocked the world, killing more than two hundred Japanese. Japan dispatched a large army to suppress it, and more than one hundred and eighty Gaoshan women collectively committed suicide to encourage their husbands, sons, and nephews to go to war. Because of such resistance from the Taiwanese people, although the assimilation and colonial policies were vigorously promoted during the Japanese rule, the number of marriages between Taiwanese and Japanese was only one in ten thousand, and the number of Japanese immigrants accounted for only 2.5% of the province's population (most of whom have now been sent back to their country). Therefore, the Cairo Declaration stipulated that "territories Japan has stolen from the Chinese, such as Manchuria, Taiwan, and the Penghu Islands, shall be returned to China." And the Potsdam Proclamation, as the post-war Allied Charter against Japan, also stated that "The terms of the Cairo Declaration shall be implemented. Japanese sovereignty shall be limited to Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu, Shikoku, and such minor islands as we determine." Because of the constraints of these international documents, the Allied Headquarters returned Taiwan to China after Japan's surrender. The Kuomintang reactionary government successively established the Administrative Governor's Office and the Provincial Government here, and used it as a training base for troops. US imperialism also established consulates here, as in other provinces of China, recognizing Taiwan as a part of Chinese territory.
    The reactionary US government, which violated Roosevelt's China policy, although nominally returned Taiwan to China, but in essence wanted to use Taiwan as a naval base for anti-Soviet, anti-communist, and aggressive purposes in the Far East. In the political aspect, during the "February 28th" incident, it instigated the masses, attempting to transform the movement of the Taiwanese people against Chiang, against US imperialism, and against corrupt rule into a criminal activity of separating from China. Later, it also fostered Taiwanese traitors such as the Liao Wenyi and Liao Wenkui brothers, who organized the pseudo-Taiwan Re-Liberation League in Tokyo, under US imperialism's exclusive control, fabricated that the Taiwanese people were of mixed blood, wrote to the United Nations, and shouted wildly for "independence," and requested "assistance" from US imperialism. In the military aspect, it sent people to direct Sun Liren in training the Kuomintang bandit army, US military jeeps ran rampant everywhere; the Kaohsiung military port once had as many as twenty-seven US warships docked; the US Air Force, based in Pingtung, frequently traveled between Tokyo and Manila; and military key areas were photographed at will. In the economic aspect, important Taiwanese enterprises mostly fell into the hands of American monopoly capitalists. In the cultural aspect, it used consulates, news offices, and libraries as centers to seduce Taiwanese compatriots and implement alienation. Such rampant and unscrupulous crimes by US imperialism even forced Chiang Kai-shek's gang's shameless bureaucrat politicians Sun Ke and Wei Daoming to publicly issue statements, pointing out that the conspiracy for Taiwan's independence had international backing. Now US imperialism sees that Chiang Kai-shek's gang has collapsed and the People's Liberation Army is about to strike Taiwan; it wants to arrange an island defense line from Japan through South Korea, Okinawa, Taiwan, and directly to the Philippines, and Taiwan is located in the center of this line. Therefore, it absurdly uses the excuse that Taiwan is still technically Japanese territory before the signing of the peace treaty with Japan, and demands to take over. May we ask, who has delayed the US imperialist's peace conference with Japan? If, as in the recent US imperialist conspiracy of undeclared peace, the peace conference with Japan is never held, then will Taiwan not be permanently nominally belonging to Japan but actually occupied by US imperialism? In the past, Taiwan was under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries for a full four years. Why didn't US imperialism demand to take over at that time, and only make this request when the People's Liberation Army is about to advance into Taiwan? How can it justify itself?
    Tibet Has Always Been a Part of Chinese Territory; US-British Aggression Conspiracy Is Bound to Fail
    As for Tibet, it has always been a part of Chinese territory. British imperialism has long coveted Tibet, but because (1) US imperialism has now become the only important pillar of the entire capitalist imperialist system, and all recent imperialist aggressions in the Far East, such as the French in Vietnam and the Dutch in the Dutch East Indies, are all directed by US imperialism behind the scenes; (2) as early as during our country's war of resistance against Japan, US imperialism used the pretext of opening up the hump route between India and Kunming, dispatching a large number of spies to deeply infiltrate Tibet; (3) the reactionary government of the Indian traitor Nehru, now because it has changed from a debtor nation to a creditor nation to Britain, but is heavily dependent on the United States, so it is more pro-American than pro-British, and Nehru will go to the United States at Truman's invitation to carry out conspiracies; (4) last year, Tibet sent a so-called business delegation to visit Washington, talking nonsense about the "independence of Tibet"; we conclude that US imperialism is actually in an active position in this Tibetan conspiracy. British imperialism and the Indian traitor Nehru are just pawns of US imperialism.
    The Indian News Agency said: "Due to the recent developments in the situation in China, the Tibetan authorities are deeply afraid that the establishment of an office by the Kuomintang in Lhasa will cause communist activities to invade Tibet, so they have requested the Chinese (Kuomintang) office in Tibet to withdraw from Lhasa." From this passage, the conspiracy of US, British, and Indian aggression against Tibet can be said to be clearly revealed. The British and Indian reactionaries' claim that "Britain has never recognized Tibet as a part of China and under Chinese rule" is even more arbitrary barking, obliterating historical facts. The Sino-British Tibetan-Indian Supplementary Treaty of 1906 clearly stipulates that "Britain shall not interfere in all internal affairs of Tibet, and China also acknowledges that other foreign countries (referring to Tsarist Russia) shall not be allowed to interfere in Tibetan territory and all its internal affairs." And the Qing government paid Britain's indemnity on behalf of Tibet. The Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907 also clearly stipulates that "The two countries recognize China's suzerainty over Tibet, and henceforth no negotiations shall be conducted with Tibet by any means without the Chinese government." In the Simla Conference between China, Britain, and India in India from the second to the third year of the Republic of China, the draft treaty proposed by the British side and rejected by our country also had the clear statement that "The Chinese and British governments both recognize Tibet as a country belonging to China's suzerainty." This proves that Tibet is a part of Chinese territory, and the British and Indian reactionaries are not allowed to attempt to invade it. In fact, US and British imperialists themselves do not know these historical facts, and the reason why they are arguing unreasonably is nothing more than because Chiang Kai-shek has collapsed, and they no longer have more powerful lackeys in China, so they have to carry out new conspiracies to prevent the liberation of all parts of China.
    When the world's peace and democracy camp, headed by the Soviet Union, is becoming increasingly strong, and the national liberation movement in the East and the Chinese people's liberation movement are magnificent, the fascist aggressive camp headed by US imperialism is trembling with fear. In order to prevent the People's Liberation Army from liberating Taiwanese and Tibetan compatriots, US and British imperialists dare to be outwardly strong but inwardly weak, fabricate shameless fallacies, and conspire to steal our territory. We must strengthen unity, redouble our efforts, and under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, vigorously support the front line, so that the People's Liberation Army can quickly strike Taiwan and Tibet, thoroughly liberate the long-oppressed and eager-to-be-liberated Taiwanese and Tibetan compatriots; at the same time, further unite with the Soviet Union to smash the aggressive conspiracies of US and British imperialism, convene the peace conference with Japan as soon as possible, and eradicate all the evil conspiracies of US imperialism, especially MacArthur, who violates the will of the Allied people, supports the remnants of Japanese military fascism, oppresses the Japanese people, and endangers world peace.

　　九三学社发表宣言
  　揭露美英侵略阴谋
  　呼吁迅速解放台湾西藏
    美帝制造借口妄图霸占台湾
    【本报讯】九三学社于九月十四日发表宣言，痛斥美英帝国主义侵略我国台湾西藏的阴谋，宣言称：
    “当我解放大军，解放福州、兰州、西宁等地，逼近台湾西藏的时候，中国革命的最大敌人——美帝，除了发表白皮书，公开宣布仍将扶植所谓民主个人主义者，做它的第五纵队外，又借口“在对日和约签订前，台湾仍是日本领土”，准备接管在四年前根据开罗及波茨坦宣言，业已交还中国的台湾，并指使其小伙计英帝，利用素以东方反共头目自居的印奸尼赫鲁反动政权，在西藏制造所谓“共党捣乱”事件，以为驱逐汉人，侵占西藏的口实。代表印度政府的印度通讯社及所谓“英国权威人士”竟推翻历史，否认中国对西藏的宗主权，甚至威胁地说：“如果中国有强加其统治于西藏的企图，西藏即可……觅取英国的干涉。”美英帝国主义如此强词夺理，除使我们进一步地认识帝国主义者这种青脸獠牙的真面孔，提高警惕性外，更十足的显露出帝国主义者自己日暮途穷，手忙脚乱的窘状。
    台湾原为我国的一个行省，除高山族占全省人口百分之二·五外，全为闽南粤东一带移民的后裔。一八九五年，满清因甲午中日战争失败，马关订约，割于日本，即遭台湾人民反对，曾树立黄虎旗，成立台湾民主国，拥戴巡抚唐景崧任总统。事虽失败，然在此后日本统治五十一年间，台湾人民因不堪日本统治者之高压政策，暴动起义，史不绝书。其中如罗福星、余清芳所领导的大革命，同志数十万，响应遍全台，诚如日人所说：“三年一小变，五年一大变”。而被目为浑浑噩噩的高山族，亦曾发生一度轰动全球的雾社暴动，杀戮日人两百以上，日本派遣大军进剿，高山族妇女百八十余，曾集体自杀，以激励其丈夫子侄出战。因台胞如此反抗，故在日本统治期间，虽极力推行同化与殖民政策，但台日结婚者不过万分之一，日人移入者不过占全省人口百分之二·五（现多遣送回国）。因此，开罗会议宣言规定：“日本所窃取于中国之领土，如满洲、台湾、澎湖等，均应归还中国”。而作为战后盟国对日大宪章之波茨坦公告也说：“开罗宣言之条件，必将实施。日本主权，必将限于本州、北海道、九州、四国及所决定其他小岛之内”。因为有此等国际文件之约束，故日本投降后，盟总即将台湾归还中国。国民党反动政府，曾在此地先后设立行政长官公署及省政府，并作为练军基地。美帝亦曾在此设立领事馆，如在中国其他省区一样，承认台湾是中国领土之一部。
    违背罗斯福对华政策的美国反动政府，虽说在名义上把台湾交还中国，但实质上是想利用台湾作反苏反共及侵略远东的海军基地。在政治方面，当“二二八”事变中，曾鼓动群众，拟将台湾人民反蒋反美帝反贪污统治的运动，转变成为脱离中国的罪恶活动。以后又豢养台奸廖文毅廖文奎兄弟等，在美帝独占下的东京，组织伪台湾再解放联盟，捏造台湾人民为混血种，上书联合国，狂叫“独立”，并请求美帝“援助”。在军事方面，则派人指挥孙立人训练国民党匪军，美军吉普车到处横冲直撞；高雄军港最多时曾泊美军舰二十七艘；以屏东为根据地的美空军，经常往来于东京马尼剌间；军事要地随便摄影。在经济方面，则台湾重要企业，多落入美国独占资本家之手。在文化方面，则以领事馆、新闻处、图书馆为中心，诱惑台胞，实行离间。美帝这种猖狂无忌的罪行，连蒋介石匪帮的无耻官僚政客孙科、魏道明辈也不得不公开发表谈话，指摘台湾独立的阴谋具有国际背景。现在美帝看见蒋介石匪帮垮台了，解放军快打到台湾了；它要布置一由日本经南韩、琉球、台湾、直达菲律宾之岛屿防线，而台湾适居此线之中心。遂荒谬绝伦地借口台湾在对日和约签订前，在技术上仍是日本领土，要求接管。试问美帝对日和会，是谁延不召开，果如美帝最近不宣而和的阴谋，永远不召开对日和会，那么台湾不将永久名义上属日本而实际上由美帝占领吗？过去台湾在国民党反动派统治下，整整四年之久，美帝当时何不要求接管，独于解放军快将进军台湾之时，提出这个要求？将何以自圆其说？
    西藏向为中国领土　美英侵略阴谋必败
    至于西藏本来是中国领土之一部。英帝觊觎西藏固有很久历史，但由于（一）美帝现已成为整个资本帝国主义制度之惟一重要支柱，最近所有各帝国主义在远东侵略，如法帝之于越南、荷帝之于荷印，都由美帝在背后指使；（二）早在我国对日抗战时，美帝即已借口开辟印昆间驼峰航线，派遣大批间谍，深入西藏活动；（三）印奸尼赫鲁的反动政府，现因对英已由债务国变成债权国，而对美则依赖颇深，故亲美实远过于亲英，尼赫鲁且将应杜鲁门之邀赴美，进行阴谋活动；（四）去年西藏曾派所谓商务代表团，访问华盛顿，妄谈“西藏独立”问题；我们断定这次西藏阴谋，美帝实处于主动地位。英帝和印奸尼赫鲁，不过是美帝的走卒罢了。
    印度新闻社说：“由于中国最近局势的发展，西藏当局深恐因国民党在拉萨设立办事处，而引起共产党的活动，侵入西藏，故请中国（国民党）驻藏办事处撤离拉萨”，由这段话看来，美英印侵略西藏的阴谋，可说是昭然若揭。英印反动派妄称：“英国从未承认西藏是中国的一部分，并受中国统辖的讲法”，更是任意狂吠，抹煞史实。一九○六年，中英所订藏印续约，明白规定：“英国不干涉西藏的一切内政，中国亦承认不准其他外国（指沙俄）干涉藏境及其一切内政。”并由清政府代西藏偿付对英赔款。一九○七年英俄协约，亦明白规定：“两国承认中国对西藏之宗主权，自后非经中国政府，不得与西藏为何等交涉。”民国二年至三年，中英印在印度希摩拉会议，由英方提出，而为我国所拒绝的草约，亦有“中英政府均承认西藏为属于中国宗主权之国家”的明文。由此可以证明西藏为中国领土之一部，不容英印反动派妄图侵略。其实美英帝国主义者自己何尝不知道这些史实，他们所以强词夺理，无非是因为蒋匪垮台，他们在中国再没有更得力的走狗，不能不进行新的阴谋，以阻止中国各个部分的一一解放而已。
    当全世界以苏联为首的和平民主阵营日益强大，东方民族解放运动与中国人民解放运动，波澜壮阔，以美帝为首的法西斯侵略阵营骇得发抖的时候，美英帝国主义者，为了阻止人民解放军解放台藏同胞，竟敢色厉内荏，制造无耻谰言，阴谋窃占我领土。我们更要加强团结，加倍努力，一致在中国共产党和毛主席朱总司令的领导下，大力支援前线，使人民解放军迅速地打到台湾去，打到西藏去，彻底解放久经压迫、渴待解放的台藏同胞；同时更进一步地与苏联联合，粉碎美英帝国主义的侵略阴谋，早日召开对日和会，根绝美帝尤其麦克阿瑟违反盟国人民意志，扶植日本军事法西斯残余势力，压迫日本人民，危害世界和平的一切罪恶阴谋。
