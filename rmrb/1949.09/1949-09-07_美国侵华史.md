　　A History of American Aggression Against China
  　Two: Gradually Moving Towards Independent Aggression Against China (Continued 10)
    At that time, there were two openly opposed political forces in China: one was the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois anti-Manchu revolutionary force represented by Sun Yat-sen, and the other was the landlord-class comprador-class anti-revolutionary force represented by Yuan Shikai, who inherited the Qing Dynasty. The imperialists each attempted to choose an object that suited their needs from between the two, to be used as a tool to continue exploiting the Chinese people. Not long after the Wuchang Uprising, the United States expressed its "sympathy" for the Nanjing Provisional Government. (Note: Sun Yat-sen's Autobiography, contained in the Complete Works of Sun Yat-sen; Zou Lu's Draft History of the Kuomintang, Volume 4; also Man Yi Hua Xia Ji, Extra Edition, General Discussion, page 18.) However, Japan took the lead, and in November 1911, Mitsui & Co. lent the Nanjing government 300,000 yuan for preparatory expenses (Note: Zhang Xiaoruo: Biography of Mr. Zhang Jian of Nantong, Zhonghua Edition, pp. 170-171). In January 1912, after the establishment of the Nanjing government, Sun Yat-sen "specially permitted" the Japanese Bantani Yoshiro to establish the privilege of "China National Central Bank" (Note: Yuansheng's posthumous works, Commercial Press, Volume 3, page 113). Subsequently, Japan successively obtained the joint venture rights of the Suzhou Railway and the Hanyeping Company through the Nanjing government (Note: Zhang Xiaoruo's previous book, pp. 170-177). Of course, the United States was very dissatisfied. Wang Chonghui, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Nanjing Provisional Government, twice requested recognition from the US government, but was rejected twice. American newspapers criticized Sun Yat-sen's ideals as "absurd and ridiculous," and together with Britain, created an atmosphere of "either Yuan or perish" and "no recognition without Yuan" (Note: Cai Hesen: Military Unification and Provincial Autonomy, Warlord Dictatorship and Warlord Separatism, September 20, 1922, Guide, Issue 2.), exerting diplomatic pressure on Sun Yat-sen, causing the Nanjing camp to quickly disintegrate. Sun Yat-sen was forced to resign as Provisional President, and Yuan Shikai succeeded him in Beijing. The US Senate and House of Representatives passed a bill on February 29 to "congratulate" the establishment of the Chinese "republican government" (Note: Zhang Zhongfu's previous article, Diplomacy Monthly, Volume 6, Issue 1.). The State Department also expressed welcome to Yuan Shikai's "strong rule" (Note: US, Terraz, China and the United States.). Since then, American aggressors have been actively supporting Yuan Shikai, the thief of the country, and his disciples.
    Yuan Shikai's political activities mainly relied on Britain, but he also had certain relations with the United States. In August and September 1912 (the first year of the Republic of China), Sun Yat-sen and Yuan Shikai met in Beijing. There was a secret conversation, and a famous reporter at the time reported the content of this conversation, saying: "Sun asked Yuan about the history of alliance with the United States (the history of the United States using Yuan), and Yuan told him so and so, and Sun sighed on the spot, saying it was a long-term plan (the United States' long-term plan to use Yuan)." (Note: Huang Yuanyong: Sun Yat-sen in the Eyes of a Reporter, Yuansheng's posthumous works, Volume 2, page 119.) From this, we can know that the United States' use of Yuan Shikai has a long history and a "long-term plan." Sun Yat-sen, as the leader of the Kuomintang, "advocated alliance with Japan" (Note: Sun Yat-sen personally added annotations to Chen Ying Shizhi's letter to Huang Keqiang, contained in the Complete Works of Sun Yat-sen, An Appendix to Can Know Must Be Able to Do, Shanghai Zhongshan Bookstore Edition, Volume 2, pp. 6-7.). During this period, the struggle between imperialists for China was mainly the struggle between Britain and Japan. The United States generally supported Britain. The policies of Britain, the United States, and Japan in using China were different. Japan created chaos in China to profit from it, so it often manipulated various opposing forces at the same time; Britain and the United States often supported a most reactionary representative figure and his government in China.　　　　　　(To be continued)

　　美国侵华史
  　二　逐渐走向独立侵略中国　（续十）
    当时中国有两种公开对立的政治势力，一是以孙中山为代表的资产阶级小资产阶级反满的革命势力，另一是以袁世凯为代表的地主阶级买办阶级继承满清的反革命势力。帝国主义者各企图在两者之间，选择一个合乎自己需要的对象，用为继续榨取中国人民的工具，武昌起义不久，美国曾表示过它对南京临时政府的“同情”。（注：孙中山自传，载中山全书；邹鲁国民党史稿，四卷；又满夷猾夏记，外编，通论下，一八页。）但被日本捷足先登，一九一一年十一月便由三井洋行借给南京政府筹备经费三十万元，（注：张孝若：南通张季直先生传记，中华版，一七○—一七一页。）一九一二年正月南京政府成立，孙中山即“特许”日人版谷芳郎设立“中华国立中央银行”的特权（注：远生遗著商务版，三卷，一一三页。）此后日本更通过南京政府相继取得苏州铁路及汉冶萍公司的合办权等（注：张孝若前书，一七○—一七七页。）当然，美国是很不满意的，南京临时政府的外交总长王宠惠两次向美政府请求承认，两次碰壁。美国报纸既指责孙中山的理想为“荒谬绝伦”，又和英国制造一种“非袁则亡”，“非袁则不承认”的空气（注：蔡和森：武力统一与联省自治，军阀专政与军阀割据，一九二二年九月二十日，向导第二期。），对孙中山施以外交压力，使南京阵营迅速分化，孙中山被迫辞去临时大总统，由袁世凯在北京继任，美国上下两院于二月二十九日通过一个议案，“庆贺”中国“共和政府”成立。（注：张忠绂前文，外交月报，六卷，一期。）国务院也表示欢迎袁世凯“强有力的统治”。（注：美，特拉斯著：中国与美国。）此后美国侵略者对袁世凯这个窃国大盗及其徒子徒孙们一直都是积极支持的。
    袁世凯的政治活动，主要依靠英国，对美国也有一定的关系，一九一二年（民国元年）八九月间，孙中山与袁世凯在北京见面，有一幕秘密谈话，当时有位名记者报导这个谈话内容说：“孙君遂问袁君以联美历史（美利用袁的历史），袁乃告之如此如此，孙君即席嗟叹，谓为远谋（美利用袁的远谋）”。（注：黄远庸：记者眼中之孙中山，远生遗著，二卷，一一九页。）由此可以知道美国利用袁世凯是历史悠久而又有“远谋”的。身为国民党领袖的孙中山则“向主联日”（注：孙中山亲在陈英士致黄克强书中所加按语，载中山全书，能知必能行附录，上海中山书局版，二册，六七页。）在此时期内，帝国主义者争夺中国的斗争，主要是英日的斗争，美国一般是赞助英国的。英美与日本利用中国的政策有不相同之处，日本是制造中国纷乱，从中取利，因之对各种对立势力常同时操纵；英美则常扶持中国一个最反动的代表人物及其政府。　　　　　　（未完）
