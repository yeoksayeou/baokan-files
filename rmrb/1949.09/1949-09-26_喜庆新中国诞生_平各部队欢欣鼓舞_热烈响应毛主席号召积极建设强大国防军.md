Celebrating the Birth of New China
  Troops in Beiping are Elated
    Enthusiastically Responding to Chairman Mao's Call to Actively Build a Strong National Defense Force
    [Reported by Our Newspaper] After the news of the opening of the People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) spread, all circles in Beiping expressed their warm support, celebrating the birth of the great New China. In particular, the heroic troops who had fought hundreds of battles and made countless contributions to the people were overjoyed. All commanders and fighters of the Special Forces of the North China Military Region unanimously expressed their warm support for the CPPCC and were determined to fight to the end to defend the People's Republic of China. Chief of Staff Li, after listening to Chairman Mao's recorded broadcast with the soldiers, said: "After listening to Chairman Mao's speech, I was so moved that I almost shed tears. The great people's leader, Chairman Mao, has led the revolution for more than twenty years, experiencing all kinds of hardships and encountering all kinds of difficulties. Now, the CPPCC has finally been successfully convened, sentencing the old China to death and announcing the birth of the New China. How exciting this is! Chairman Mao's speech embodies the will of the people across the country, and every sentence has the power of steel." All commanders and fighters unanimously recognized that the task of the special forces is even more important in the future. In the future, we must build strong mechanized units to defend the national defense, use our anti-aircraft guns to guard the people's airspace, and push the artillery to the coast. Imperialists, whoever dares to invade us will be resolutely wiped out.
    The wounded and sick soldiers of the People's Liberation Army recuperating in the Beiping Army Hospital were even more moved when they heard the news of the opening of the CPPCC, saying, "This is a sign of the victory of the Chinese revolution. Our years of bloody struggle have finally paid off today!" Zhang Yongcai, a soldier of the 40th Army who had lost a left leg, said, "In the past, I worked for the landlord for eight years, suffering untold hardships. Later, I joined the revolution because the people wanted to be liberated! Now that the people have control of the state power, I am happy even though my leg is broken! And I will still participate in the work and use my two hands to build our country!" Ding Zemin, who participated in the Long March of 25,000 li, recalled the heroic deeds of climbing snow-capped mountains and crossing grasslands, saying, "After all kinds of hardships, we finally overcame all difficulties and achieved today."
    All cadres and members of the Beiping Garrison Headquarters, who are undertaking the glorious task of defending the people's capital, are not only overjoyed by the opening of the CPPCC, but also adhere to their posts and work hard, feeling that the tasks they shoulder are more important and more glorious. When the salute was fired at 9 p.m. on the 21st, the personnel performing duties in every corner of the city were greatly moved. Li Yu, of the guard platoon, even shed tears at the time.
    Chairman Mao's opening speech, especially the mention of the need to develop a strong army, navy and air force to defend the motherland's territory, deeply moved the hearts of every soldier and increased their unparalleled strength. They unanimously proposed: "In the future, we will complete all tasks given by the higher authorities with a positive working attitude; respond to Chairman Mao's call to build a national defense force." The personnel on duty that night patrolled the streets in the heavy rain without any slackness until dawn. Now all the personnel are involved in a campaign to make contributions. The entire unit has only one heart—to resolutely ensure the safety of the CPPCC.

　　喜庆新中国诞生
  　平各部队欢欣鼓舞
    热烈响应毛主席号召积极建设强大国防军
    【本报讯】当人民政协开幕的消息传出后，北平各界一致表示热烈拥护，欢庆伟大的新中国的诞生，特别是身经百战、对人民立过多少汗马功劳的部队英雄们，更是欢欣若狂。华北军区特种兵部队的全体指战员一致表示热烈拥护人民政协，并决心为保卫中华人民共和国而奋斗到底。李参谋长在和战士们听完毛主席的广播录音后说：“听了毛主席的讲话，我感动得几乎落眼泪。伟大的人民领袖毛主席领导革命奋斗了二十几年，什么苦没吃过，什么困难没遇到过？现在终于胜利地召开了人民政协，判决了旧中国的死刑，宣布了新中国的诞生，这是多么令人兴奋的事啊！毛主席的讲话是集中了全国人民的意志，每句话都有着钢铁般的力量。”全体指战员们都一致认识到：今后特种兵的任务更重大了，今后要建设强大的机械化兵团，保卫祖国的国防，把自己的高射炮守卫着人民的领空，把大炮推向海岸去，帝国主义者们，谁要来侵略我们，就坚决消灭他。
    在北平陆军医院休养的人民解放军伤病员们，听到人民政协开幕消息时，更感动地说：“这是中国革命胜利的标志，我们多年的流血奋斗今天可有了成果啦！”伤了一条左腿的四十军战士张永才说：“过去我给地主扛了八年活，受了说不尽的苦，后来我就参加了革命，那是为了人民要翻身哪！现在人民掌握了国家政权，我的腿虽然打折了，心里也是高兴！而且我还要参加工作，用我的两只手来建设咱们的国家！”参加过二万五千里长征的丁泽民回忆着当年爬雪山过草地……等等的英雄事迹说：“历尽千辛万苦，但终于战胜了一切困难而有了今天。”
    担任保卫人民首都光荣任务的北平纠察总队的全体干部、队员除了为人民政协的开幕欢欣鼓舞外，更坚守岗位，努力工作，感到自己肩负的任务更重大更光荣了。当二十一号晚上礼炮轰鸣时，分散在全城各个角落执行勤务的人员，受到了极大的感动，警卫排李玉当时竟掉下泪来。
    毛主席大会开幕词的录音特别是提到必须发展强大的陆海空国防军，以保卫祖国领土的时候，深深地激动了每个战士的心，增加了无比的力量。他们一致提出：“今后决以积极的工作态度来完成上级给予的一切任务；响应毛主席建设国防军的号召。”当晚值勤人员冒着大雨在街上来往巡逻，没有毫丝松懈，直到天明，现在全体人员正卷入立功热潮中，全部队只有一条心——坚决保卫人民政协安全。
