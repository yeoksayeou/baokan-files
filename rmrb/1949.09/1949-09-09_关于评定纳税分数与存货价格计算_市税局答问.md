Title: On the Assessment of Taxable Points and Calculation of Inventory Prices – Q&A with the Municipal Tax Bureau

To the Editor: I have a question that I would like you to answer. The current Profit-Seeking Enterprise Income Tax implemented in our city stipulates that each industry association should assess the points each company should bear and submit them to the tax bureau. The tax bureau then levies taxes from each company based on these points. If the company had no profit in the second half of 1937, should it still pay taxes based on the points assessed by the association? Or can it be exempted from paying taxes? Also, what is the standard for calculating the value of inventory at the end of 1937? If the goods were inventory from the end of 1936 and were not sold in 1937, if these goods are still calculated at the inventory price at the end of 1936, and the new goods purchased in 1937 that were not sold out at the end of the year are calculated at the new purchase price in 1937, I wonder if this method of calculating the price of goods meets the calculation standards of the Tax Bureau? Please take the trouble to answer them.

Mr. Li Yongsheng:

The Tax Bureau's answer to your question about the profit income tax is as follows:

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
Editor

(1) The evaluation work for the Profit-Seeking Enterprise Income Tax for the second half of 1937 in our city was carried out by the evaluation committees at all levels. As for whether the company actually has profits or not, the group leaders (selected by each business) and the industry evaluation committees are very aware of this. If there is really no business or little profit, the industry evaluation committees will definitely take care of it and reduce or exempt it during the evaluation.

(2) The calculation of inventory prices should be based on the price at the time of the inventory. We believe that your calculation method is not quite right. Because when goods purchased in 1936 are sold in 1937, they will never be sold at the price of 1936. Since they are sold at the price at the time of sale, the price at that time must be used as the calculation standard when taking inventory.

### 关于评定纳税分数与存货价格计算——市税局答问

　　关于评定纳税分数与存货价格计算——市税局答问
    编者同志：我有一个问题请你答复一下。此次本市实施的营利事业所得税，规定由各业公会评好各家应负担的分数，呈到税务局；税务局即依此项向各家征税。如该号三十七年下半年本无盈利，是否亦应按公会所评分数缴纳税款？抑或可免缴税款？又三十七年年终存货货价计算以何为标准？如货物为三十六年年终所存的，而三十七年并未售出，此种货如仍按三十六年年终存货价计算，三十七年新进之货在年终未售清者则按三十七年新进货价计算，不知此种计算货价方法是否合乎税务局计算标准？均请费神予以答复。

    李永盛先生：
    你所问关于营利所得税问题经税务局解答如下：
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    编者
    （一）此次本市征收三十七年下半年营利事业所得税的评议工作，是由各级评议委员会评议的，至于该号究竟有无盈利，各小组长（各商号自选的）及各行业评议委员会都很了解。如真无营业或赚钱不多，则各行业评议委员会一定会照顾，在评议时减少或免掉。
    （二）存货价格的计算应以盘查时的价格为标准，你的计算方法我们认为是不大对的。因为三十六年买进的货在三十七年出卖时，绝不会按三十六年的价格出售，既是按出卖时价格卖出，因此盘货时必须以当时的价格为计算标准。
