　　Private Middle School Tuition Issues
  　Dazhong and Songyun Resolve Appropriately
  　Inviting Parents to Discuss School Budgets and Teachers and Students to Repair School Buildings to Reduce Tuition Fees
    [Reported by this newspaper] Schools in this city have successively started classes. The tuition issues of more than eighty private middle schools have been mostly resolved based on the principle of democratic consultation. Among them, Dazhong Middle School resolved the issue by having teachers, students, and parents jointly review the school budget. Songyun Middle School, led by the principal, had teachers and students repair school buildings and furniture themselves, reducing the burden on students.
    Regarding the determination of tuition fees, Dazhong Middle School took into account three principles: school expenses, the burden on parents and students, and the willingness of students to pay. The principal and department heads drafted a preliminary budget for the semester based on income and expenditure. They then convened all faculty, staff, and student representatives for discussion. After a month of repeated discussions, a draft budget was formulated, stipulating tuition fees: 50 "real units" for senior high school and 46 "real units" for junior high school. Finally, the school invited parents to a meeting to review the draft budget and use this as an opportunity to unite parents. The school sent out over seven hundred letters, and about six hundred parents attended the meeting. At the meeting, parents understood the school's difficulties, and the school understood the parents' difficulties. Most parents agreed to approve the draft budget, but a small number of parents, unclear about how the budget was decided, hoped for further tuition reductions. After persuasion and explanation from other parents, they also agreed. At the meeting, student representatives suggested paying in installments, and parents offered guarantees – with organizations or shops acting as guarantors, which the school agreed to adopt. Parents and students also expressed concern about the issue of tuition waivers. The school's draft budget already stipulated 50 free places, so a discussion was held at the meeting. Everyone used democratic consultation to determine the criteria for tuition waivers: excellent academic performance, ideological progress, and a poor family background. At the same time, the application procedure was decided: first, discussion in the class, then submission to a democratic evaluation committee composed of school staff, faculty, and students for final review. After the meeting, everyone felt very satisfied. Now, the first phase of payment at Dazhong has ended. Over four hundred students have paid the full fee, over a hundred have requested to pay in installments or delay payment, guaranteeing to pay in full during the second phase, and over a hundred have applied for tuition waivers. The awarding of these waivers will be decided through democratic evaluation after the start of the semester. Before determining the amount of tuition, Songyun Middle School considered the difficulties faced by students' parents and tried to reduce expenses. This summer was very rainy, and many of Songyun Middle School's buildings collapsed, and the desks and chairs were incomplete. If workers were hired to repair them, it would require a large expense, and the budget for the next semester would inevitably increase as a result. Therefore, the principal decided to personally take the lead, mobilizing a large number of faculty, staff, and students to work together. Everyone carried bricks, mixed soil, hammered nails, and cut wood. Within a few days, the walls were repaired, and more than two hundred desks and chairs were repaired, reducing school expenses. Each student only needs to pay 70 catties of millet for tuition.

　　私立中学学费问题
  　大中嵩云妥善解决
  　邀集家长讨论学校预算师生修缮校舍减轻学费
    【本报讯】本市各中学校已先后开学，八十余个私立中学的学费问题，大部分已根据民主协商原则获得解决，其中大中中学是以学校师生和家长共同审议学校预算来解决的；嵩云中学则由校长带头，师生自己动手修理校舍家具，减轻了学生负担。
    大中中学校方对学费数额之订定，以照顾校方支出、家长同学的负担和同学愿意交纳三点为原则，由校长和各主任量出为入的草拟本学期的初步预算，并召集全体教职员和学生代表研讨，经过一个月反复研讨，拟定了预算草案，规定了学费：高中是五十个折实单位，初中四十六个折实单位。最后，校方又邀请家长开会，审核预算草案，并借此团结家长。学校发出了七百多封信，来参加会议的约有六百名家长。会上，家长们了解了学校的困难，学校也了解了家长的困难。在大部分家长同意通过了预算草案，还有小部分家长，因为不明了学校这次预算是怎样决定的，希望收费再减少些，经过别的家长说服解释，也同意了。会上同学代表提出分期交费的建议，家长们也提出了保证——由机关或商店作保，校方表示采纳。家长和同学还关心免费生的问题，在校方预算草案上已规定免费名额五十人，于是在会上展开讨论，大家以民主协商的方式订出成绩优良、思想进步、家境清寒为免费生标准，同时决定申请的步骤：首先由班里讨论，然后交给校方、教职员、学生组成的民主评定委员会作最后审核。会后，任何一方都感到很满意。现在，大中第一期缴费已告结束，有四百余名同学缴了全费，有百余名请求分期缓交，并保证在第二期缴足，另有百余人申请免费，这是要待开学后以民主评议方式来决定的。嵩云中学在订定学费额数以前，校方就考虑到学生家长的困难，设法减少开支。今年夏季多雨，嵩云中学校舍倒坍颇多，桌凳也残缺不全，如果雇人修理，需要一笔庞大的费用，下学期的预算数字必然也为之增多。为此，校长决定由本人亲自带头，动员庞大教职员和学生共同劳动，大家搬砖、合土、敲钉、截木，几天之内，墙壁修补好了，二百多件桌凳也修理完毕，减少学校一笔开支，每个同学只需缴纳七十斤小米的学费。
