　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 4th. TASS, citing an article by Shakhmagonova in the Moscow News entitled "New Methods of Marshallization," reveals the despicable conspiracy of American monopoly capitalists who recently colluded with French reactionaries to set fire to 200,000 hectares of large forests in southwestern France in order to strike at the French forest chemical industry. The author writes: When the fire broke out, the councilors of the southwestern provinces immediately demanded emergency measures to extinguish the forest fire, but the French government did not order the dispatch of 3,000 soldiers and two aircraft to fight the fire until the fire had become a prairie fire. The manpower and machinery dispatched were less than those used to suppress the strike of the workers at the Snecma aircraft factory. Defense Minister Ramadier even refused to fight the fire, saying it was not his responsibility.
    The author continues: The reason for the French government's indifference to the forest fire should be found in the activities of American chemical companies in France and the resurgence of de Gaulle's conspiracy. Before the war, France was the world's second largest producer of turpentine. A large amount of turpentine was produced from the famous Basgogna forest in southwestern France. This situation was naturally displeasing to the American chemical consortium. Now they are using this to strike at the French forest chemical industry. According to the arsonists' plan, this fire will not only burn down the forest, but also use it as an excuse to carry out a slander campaign against democratic groups, especially the Communist Party, in order to strengthen their police terror and prepare the ground for the establishment of a military fascist dictatorship. However, the author states: Although the first objective—destroying the French forest—was achieved, and the French forest chemical industry suffered irreparable losses, the provocative act aimed at opposing French democracy has clearly failed. The arsonists were caught on the spot; they were secret police of the former Vichy government and clearly members of the same reactionary organizations connected with the French People's Rally and its leader, de Gaulle.
    Shakhmagonova concludes: In adopting arson as a means of Marshallizing France, the French rulers never imagined that the flames of the fire would drive away the darkness in the dark corners, exposing the ugly face of the anti-French people's conspiracy web being woven by American colonialists and their French cronies.

　　马歇尔化的新手段
  　美帝唆使戴高乐分子焚毁法廿万公顷森林
    【新华社北平四日电】塔斯社引莫斯科消息报所刊沙克马高诺娃“马歇尔化的新手段”一文，揭露美国独占资本家最近勾结法国反动派纵火焚毁法国西南部二十万公顷大森林以打击法国的森林化学工业的卑劣阴谋。作者写道：当大火发生后，西南各省议员立即要求采取紧急措施，扑灭森林大火，但法国政府却一直到火势已成燎原，才由内政部长下令遣送三千名兵土和两架飞机去救火，出动的人力和机器较之用予镇压斯奈克马飞机厂罢工工人的要少得多。国防部长拉马第甚至拒绝救火，说这不是他的责任。
    作者继称：法国政府对森林大火这种漠不关心的原因，应该从美国化学公司在法国的活动与戴高乐阴谋又趋活跃这两件事中去找。在战前，法国是世界第二位的松节油出产国。大宗松节油是由法国西南部有名的柏司哥纳森林出产的。这种情形当然为美国化学康采仑所不高兴。现在他们就以此来打击法国的森林化学工业。按照纵火者的计划，这次大火不仅要焚毁森林，同时也要以之为对民主团体，特别是共产党进行侮蔑运动的借口，以便加强其警察恐怖，并为建立军事法西斯独裁准备基础。但是作者说明：虽然第一个目的——摧毁法国的森林是达到了，同时法国的森林化学工业也遭受到了不可补偿的损失，而旨在反对法国民主的挑拨行为却显然失败了。纵火者被当场捕获，他们是前维希政府的秘密警察，且显然是与法国人民联盟及其领袖戴高乐有关系的同类反动组织的人员。
    沙克马高诺娃结语称：在采取纵火作为使法国马歇尔化的手段时，法国统治者绝没有想到大火的火焰竟会驱去了阴暗角落中的黑暗，使美国殖民者及其法国亲信们正在编造的反法国人民阴谋网丑态毕露。
