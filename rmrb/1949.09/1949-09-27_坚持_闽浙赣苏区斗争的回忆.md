Persistence
    ——Recollections of the Struggle in the Fujian-Zhejiang-Jiangxi Soviet Area
    Rong
    In 1928, the Chinese Communist Party began rural work in the Guixi and Yiyang areas of northeastern Jiangxi, mobilizing the masses. In the following year, armed uprisings began in various places. In 1930, a congress of workers, peasants, and soldiers was held, and the Fujian-Zhejiang-Jiangxi District People's Government—the Soviet Government—was established. Various democratic social reforms were implemented, and various mass organizations were established, such as: peasant associations, youth leagues, women's federations, red guard corps, etc. The people enthusiastically participated in the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, armed to defend the Soviet government, and supported the front line with unparalleled enthusiasm. Taking women alone, in addition to actively participating in production work and various mass movements, they warmly received the Red Army passing through. As soon as the Red Army arrived, they immediately boiled tea and served water, cleaned rooms, and went to the hospital every week to comfort the wounded and sick Red Army comrades with pork, eggs, and other gifts. From 1931, the Kuomintang reactionaries launched large-scale offensives against the Soviet area, with five major "encirclement and suppression" campaigns in succession. At that time, the Red Army was small in number and lacked weapons, relying entirely on indomitable fighting spirit and the support of the broad masses. During the first "encirclement and suppression," we sharpened many bamboo sticks and inserted them at the bottom of mountain gullies, covered them with bamboo, and concealed them with loose soil. When the Chiang bandit troops stepped on them and fell into the pits, they would be stabbed to death or wounded by the bamboo sticks. During the second "encirclement and suppression," they were already able to identify where there might be earthen pits, so we changed our method and used earthen cannons to bomb them. The earthen cannons were bamboo tubes filled with explosives, with incense sticks inserted on top. When we discovered the Chiang bandit troops were attacking, we lit the incense sticks. When the Kuomintang bandit troops approached, they suddenly exploded, inflicting heavy casualties on them; however, this method had a drawback, namely that the timing was not easy to coordinate, and sometimes, even if lit, they often went out halfway. During the third and fourth "encirclement and suppression" campaigns, we used tripwire cannons. We installed mechanisms on the cannons and connected them with ropes. Anyone who touched them would immediately explode, playing a great role and greatly striking the offensive of the Chiang bandit troops.
    During several encirclement and suppression campaigns, the Kuomintang bandit troops adopted inhuman and brutal methods to deal with the people of the Soviet area, killing people on sight, burning houses on sight, and looting and raping were commonplace. Fortunately, the people at that time had already recognized their hideous faces. When the bandit troops came, they all fled to the mountains, leaving only a few old people to guard the houses, but even these few people often could not escape their fate. Due to resentment of the Kuomintang reactionaries' tragic and inhuman atrocities, coupled with love for the Soviet government, the people always tried to strike at the Kuomintang bandit troops. In 1931, when the bandit troops reached Maoping near Xiayaoshang, Hengfeng, the villagers fled, leaving only a few old women to guard the houses. A bandit soldier pretended to be kind and became very familiar with an old woman, even becoming her "adopted son." When the old woman's daughter-in-law went down the mountain to get something, the bandit took the opportunity to rape her, and was stabbed to death by the young daughter-in-law with a knife. In 1932, women in Sanqiao managed to lure away two bandit soldiers, enticing one of them into a room, where seven or eight women pounced on him, covering his mouth and nose, suffocating him to death, and seizing his gun. This kind of news spread everywhere, inspiring many people.
    In 1935, Comrade Fang Zhimin was unfortunately arrested, and Comrade Yu Jingde succeeded him as Chairman of the Fujian-Zhejiang-Jiangxi Soviet Government. He also gloriously sacrificed himself in Dexing not long after. This was in 1936. But the people of Fujian, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi did not succumb. They established a guerrilla base in Mopan Mountain between Dexing, Shangrao, Yiyang, and Hengfeng, and slowly developed and grew stronger.
    Later, we transferred to Shilong to continue the guerrilla warfare. The force had grown to more than seven hundred people, with four hundred guns. We stayed on the mountains during the day and went down to do mass work in the evening.
    The Kuomintang mobilized many troops in Dexing, Shangrao, Yiyang, Guixi, and other counties, implementing encirclement and suppression. The situation was quite serious. The bandit troops drove the residents at the foot of the mountain into the blockhouse lines. In addition to burning and looting, peasants suspected by them were subjected to finger-squeezing, hanging upside down, and beatings before being massacred. We transferred to Guixi, where we continued to be besieged by the Kuomintang. At Sanxingling, the bandit troops mobilized more than 17,000 people and besieged us for a week. We could not move during the day and moved at night. We could not light fires for cooking and ate very little. However, we eventually managed to safely transfer because we were well concealed.
    In 1943, the Kuomintang bandit troops of Huangtuling in Shangrao launched an attack at dawn one day. The leading comrade was unfortunately captured. After being escorted to Yiyang, the Kuomintang reactionaries wanted to use soft tactics to make him waver. Fearing that he would riot with comrades in prison, he was held in solitary confinement, but he remained unmoved. The reactionaries then resorted to torture, forcing him to confess our activities. The pseudo-county magistrate Peng Xueyou burned him with incense, but he still did not yield. Finally, they decided to execute him. On the way to the execution ground, he said to the people: "Born a revolutionary, I will die a happy revolutionary ghost! Let's see how long the Kuomintang reactionaries can be arrogant!" This great proletarian heroic spirit deeply moved countless people. This is part of the struggle history of our Chinese people. We persisted in this way, striking at the enemy and welcoming victory!

　　坚持
    ——闽浙赣苏区斗争的回忆
    荣
    一九二八年中国共产党在赣东北的贵溪、弋阳一带，已经展开农村工作，发动群众，第二年各地开始武装起义，一九三○年召开了工农兵代表大会，成立闽浙赣区人民政府——苏维埃政府，实行了各项民主社会改革，成立了各种群众组织，如：贫农团、青年团、妇女会、赤卫团等，人民踊跃的参加工农红军，武装保卫苏维埃政府，并且用了无比的热忱，支援前线。单就妇女而言，除积极参加生产工作与各种群众运动外，对过境红军都是热烈的招待。一有红军开到，立刻烧茶送水，打扫房间，每星期还到医院去慰问伤病红军同志送慰问品猪肉鸡蛋等。从一九三一年起国民党反动派便对苏区大举进攻，先后有五次大“围剿”。那时候红军数量少，武器更是缺乏，全靠不屈的斗志与广大群众的支援。第一次“围剿”，我们削了不少竹签插在山坑底，上面加上竹子，用浮土掩盖好，当蒋匪军踩上去跌下坑时，就被竹签刺死，刺伤。第二次“围剿”时，他们已经能识别那里有没有土坑，我们改变了方法，用土炮去炸他们，土炮是竹筒里放炸药，上面插着线香，当我们发现蒋匪军进攻时，便燃着线香，等到国民党匪军逼近时突然爆炸，给他们大量的死伤；可是这方法，有一个缺点就是时间不容易配合好，有时虽燃着了，半途往往熄掉。第三四次“围剿”当中，我们用挨丝炮。在炮上按上机关，用绳子连起来，谁挨着马上就爆炸，发挥了很大的作用，大大地打击了蒋匪军的进攻。
    国民党匪军在几次围剿当中，采用了灭绝人性的残暴手段来对付苏区人民，见人便杀，见房便烧，至于抢掠奸淫更是家常便饭。幸亏当时人民已经认清了他们的狰狞面目，匪军一来都逃到山上去，只留下少数老人在家里看守，但这少数人也往往不能幸免。由于愤恨国民党反动派这样惨绝人寰的暴行，加上对苏维埃政府的爱护，人民对国民党匪军总是设法打击。一九三一年，当匪军到达横峰下窑上附近毛坪的时候，村民逃跑一空，只剩下几个老女人看守房子，匪军一个士兵假装和善，与老女人混得很熟，并拜为干娘，等这老女人的媳妇下山拿东西，匪军便趁机奸淫，结果被年青的媳妇用刀刺死。一九三二年三桥妇女设法把两个匪军士兵引开，把其中之一引诱到房里，七八个妇女一拥而起，蒙住这个匪兵的口鼻，把他闷死，把枪支也夺过来了。这种消息到处传着，振奋了不少的人心。
    一九三五年方志敏同志不幸被捕以后，余敬德同志继任为闽浙赣区苏维埃政府主席，不久也在德兴壮烈牺牲。这是一九三六年的事情。但闽浙赣的人民，并未屈服，又在德兴、上饶、弋阳、横峰之间的磨盘山建立了游击根据地，慢慢的发展壮大起来。
    后来我们转到石垄继续打游击。队伍已经发展到七百多人，枪支也有四百条，白天在山上，晚间下山做群众工作。
    国民党在德兴、上饶、弋阳、贵溪等县动员了很多军队，实行围剿。情形相当严重，匪军把山脚下居民都赶到碉堡线内去了，烧抢之外，被他们认为有嫌疑的农民，捉到便是上夹棍、倒吊、毒打，然后加以屠杀。我们转移到贵溪，受到国民党继续围攻。在三星岭，匪军动员了一万七千余人，围困我们一周之久。白天不能活动，入夜活动，做饭也不能烧火，吃的很少。可是终因我们掩蔽得法，以后才安全转移。
    一九四三年，上饶黄土岭的国民党匪军在一天拂晓开始进袭，领导同志不幸被俘被押解到弋阳、解到弋阳以后，国民党反动派想利用软办法，使他动摇。又怕他与监牢中同志在一起暴动，一个人关在一处，可是他始终不为所动。反动派又改用苦刑，逼他招供我们活动情形。伪县长彭学游用香烧他也没有使他屈服，最后才决定枪毙，他在赴刑场途中，对人说：“生为革命人，死时也要痛快的做革命鬼！国民党反动派看你神气几久！”这种伟大的无产阶级英雄气概，使无数的人受了极大的感动。这是我们中国人民斗争史的一部分，我们就如此的坚持着，打击敌人，迎接胜利！
