An Invitation from the U.S. Consul in Shanghai
    Ma Fantuo
    When I returned to Shanghai this time,
    There was a pile of mail that hadn't been opened for over a month
    on the table at home.
    I opened them one by one,
    Suddenly I saw an English invitation,
    Signed "Cabot, Esquire."
　
    Mr. Cabot! I haven't forgotten,
    You are the U.S. Consul in Shanghai.
    But this time the situation is quite different,
    You did not add your official title behind your respected
    name.
    But merely used the ordinary title of "Mister," or "Sir,"
    or "Master."
    Mr. Cabot! Master Cabot!
    Who made you change your mind?
    Who removed you from your post?
    You know it very well yourself.
　
    The Chinese People's Liberation Army liberated
    Shanghai,
    This fact made you change your mind;
    The great victory of the Chinese people's democratic revolution
    Made you, Mr. Cabot, at least on the land of us Chinese
    people,
    No longer able to be your official!
　
    The hard-card invitation was printed very exquisitely,
    At the top was a gold-stamped, fiercely startled eagle,
    Below was "July 4th, tea and cocktails at ×× Avenue, Da Xi."
    Mr. Cabot! I haven't forgotten at all,
    And naturally, you wouldn't forget either,
    What day July 4th is.
　
    On this day one hundred and seventy-three years ago,
    The American bourgeoisie, oppressed by Britain,
    Announced the "Declaration of Independence" drafted by Thomas
    Jefferson,
    (Mr. Cabot, please pay attention to the content of this document!
    It contains "non-American thoughts," the democratic spirit of Locke and Voltaire),
    Announced that "all men are created equal,"
    "People have the rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,"
    And also—Mr. Cabot, do you believe it?
    There is also this sentence in this famous historical document:
    "Whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends,
    it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it,
    and to institute new Government."
    Mr. Cabot! I haven't forgotten at all,
    When you first came to Shanghai to take office,
    You made particularly reactionary remarks as soon as you landed,
    Calling the revolutionary Chinese people who "overthrow a government"
    mobs who must be suppressed.
    Anti-Soviet and anti-communist cliches,
    Were splashed out to the fullest in the "American Club" on Fuzhou Road,
    Even causing the "Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury," which pretended to have some liberalism
    and was related to your embassy,
    To be embarrassed and unable to smooth things over.
    This is not surprising,
    I heard that you have always held the post of colonial administrator,
    Moreover, the international news section of the newspaper can testify,
    Consuls of your country and the like certainly don't do a little espionage work as
　
    a mere hobby,
    So what's so strange about mouthing Goebbels's rotten tunes?
    Mr. Cabot, so what is the purpose of you inviting us cultural figures
    this time?
    Is it to repeat your old anti-Soviet and anti-communist
    cliches to us,
    In today's Shanghai, in today's China,
    I guess you wouldn't dare,
    I guess you wouldn't be so stupid.
    Is it an attempt to use this revolutionary day of July 4th
    to build relationships with progressive Chinese writers?
    If that's really the case, you're being too naive!
    You are a hundred and eight thousand miles away from July 4th,
    Your ancestors, each with a rifle,
    Fought guerrilla warfare against the British Empire's occupying forces.
    They were the revolutionaries,
    But you, you are a reactionary bureaucrat of imperialism, without
    any compromise,
    They and you are different characters in two different historical stages.
    Even if you put up the old banner of revolution,
    You can't cover up your ferocious face.
　
    July 4th, the Independence Revolution—we respect,
    Imperialists, fascists—we hate;
    Lincoln, Jefferson, Tom Paine—we respect,
    Truman, Marshall, Acheson—we hate;
    The American people – our friends,
    The American ruling class – our enemies.
    We resolutely fall on that side,
    We will not hesitate to wage a relentless struggle
    against you American imperialism,
    Against you Mr. Cabot and the like.
　
    The American troops who insulted women, shot civilians, and transported troops to aid the brutal acts
    Have already fled from Beiping, Nanjing,
    Shanghai along with the Kuomintang bandit gang...
    But you, Cabot, stayed behind and didn't leave.
    Does the State Department still have a lot of official business for you to handle?
    Cabot, we solemnly warn you,
    If you still want to resort to any conspiracies and tricks,
    The Chinese people will request the government
    To drive you out!
    No leniency!
　
    This time, the consulate envelope brought from Washington
    Has to be abandoned,
    Replaced by a common
    envelope with a purple rubber stamp of a private name
    and address,
    This small change reflects
    a major event that shook the world:
    It signifies the crushing defeat of American imperialism in China!
    It means you can no longer swagger, act domineeringly,
    and order a group of puppets like ordering a group of dogs
    here!
    It means that the Chinese peasants whom you despise, hate, and fear
    have overthrown the government supported by tens of billions of American
    dollars!
    It signifies the decline of capitalism and the victory of communism!
    It signifies the bankruptcy of the "American Century" and the growth of the people's
    democratic forces!
　
    Mr. Cabot, your invitation states:
    R.S.V.P. (Please reply),
    Alright,
    My reply is as above.

### 美帝驻沪领事的请帖

　　美帝驻沪领事的请帖
    马凡陀
    当我这次回到上海的时候，
    家里桌子上放着一个多月来没有拆的
    信。
    我一封一封地拆，
    忽然看到一个英文的请帖，
    具名是“Ｃａｂｏｔ，Ｅｓｑｕｉｒｅ”。
　
    卡白特先生！我一点也没有忘记，
    你是美国的驻沪领事。
    可是这一回情形不很相同，
    你并没有把你的官衔附加在你尊贵的姓
    名后面。
    而仅仅用了“先生”，或者“大人”，
    或者“老爷”这个普通称呼。
    卡白特先生！卡白特老爷
    ！
    谁使你改变了主意？
    谁撤了你的职？
    你自己很清楚。
　
    中国人民解放军解放了上
    海，
    这一事实使你改变了主意
    ；
    中国人民民主革命的伟大胜利
    使你，卡白特先生，至少在我们中国人
    民的土地上，
    不再能做你的官！
　
    硬卡片的请帖印刷得非常讲究，
    上端是烫金的一头猛惊的鹰，
    下面是“七月四日在大西路××号
    招待茶和鸡尾酒”。
    卡白特先生！我一点也没有忘记，
    自然，你也不至于忘记，
    七月四日是什么日子。
　
    在一百七十三年前的这一天，
    受英国压迫的美国资产阶级
    宣布了汤麦斯·杰弗逊起草的“独立宣
    言”，
    （卡白特先生，请你注意这篇东西的内
    容！
    其中有“非美国的思想”，洛克和伏尔
    泰的民主精神），
    宣布了“人是生而平等的”，
    “人有生活，自由，和追求幸福的权利
    ”，
    还有——卡白特先生，你相信吗？
    在这个著名的历史文件里还有这么一句：
    “任何政府如破坏这些权利，
    人民就可以更换或推翻这个政府，
    并创设一新政府。”
    卡白特先生！我一点也没有忘记，
    当你刚到上海来上任的时候，
    你一上岸就发表了特别反动的言论，
    把“推翻一个政府”的革命的中国人民
    称为必须镇压的暴民。
    反苏、反共的流行熟语，
    在福州路“美国总会”里尽情喷溅，
    甚至使假装带几分自由主义的，
    并且与你们大使馆有关的“大美晚报”，
    也弄得满脸尴尬，不好转圜。
    这也难怪，
    听说你一向做的是殖民地总管的官，
    何况，报纸的国际新闻版可以作证，
    贵国的领事之类干一点特务工作决不是
　
    什么业余爱好，
    满嘴戈倍尔的烂调又何足怪？
    卡白特先生，那么你这一回招待我们文
    化界人士，
    又为的什么？
    是要向我们重复一遍你的反苏反共的老
    套，
    在今天的上海，在今天的中国，
    料你也不敢，
    料你也不致那么愚蠢。
    是企图利用七月四日这革命的日子
    来和进步的中国作家们拉关系？
    如果真是这样，你想得太天真了！
    你跟七月四日离开十万八千里，
    你的祖先们一人一枝来福枪
    跟不列颠帝国占领军打游击。
    他们才是革命者，
    而你呢，你是帝国主义的反动官僚，不
    折不扣，
    他们和你们是两个不同的历史阶段中的
    不同人物。
    那怕你打起革命的老招牌
    也遮盖不住你的狰狞面目。
　
    七月四日，独立革命——我们尊敬，
    帝国主义，法西斯蒂——我们憎恨；
    林肯，杰弗逊，汤姆·潘恩——我们尊
    敬，
    杜鲁门、马歇尔、艾奇逊——我们憎恨；
    美国人民——我们的友人，
    美国的统治阶级——我们的敌人。
    我们坚决地倒在那一边，
    我们决不讳言要跟你美帝，
    跟你卡白特老爷之流作无情的斗争。
　
    侮辱妇女，枪杀平民，运兵助虐的美军
    已经和国民党匪帮一同逃出北平、南京
    、上海……
    可是你，卡白特，却留下不走。
    国务部还给你不少公事要办吧？
    卡白特，我们正告你，
    如果你们还要使什么阴谋鬼计，
    中国人民会请求政府
    把你们赶走！
    决不宽饶！
　
    从华盛顿带来的领事馆信
    封这一回只好不用了，
    代替它的是一个私人姓名
    地址的紫色橡皮戳的普通信
    封，
    这小小的变换反映着
    一件震撼世界的大事：
    它意味着美帝在华的惨败
    ！
    它意味着你们再也不能在这里耀武扬威
    ，横行霸道，命令一群傀儡象命令一群狗
    一样！
    它意味着你们所鄙视的，痛恨的，害怕
    的中国农民已经推翻了你们白化几十亿金
    元支持的政府！
    它意味着资本主义的没落，共产主义的
    胜利！
    它意味着“美国世纪”的破产，人民民
    主力量的壮大！
　
    卡白特先生，你的请帖上注明：
    Ｒ．Ｓ．Ｖ．Ｐ．（请答复），
    好吧，
    我的答复如上。
