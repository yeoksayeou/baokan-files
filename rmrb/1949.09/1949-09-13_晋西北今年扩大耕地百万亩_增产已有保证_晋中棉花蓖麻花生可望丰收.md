[Taiyuan Dispatch] This spring's production conference in the Jinxi Northwest region of Shanxi Province called for expanding cultivated land area, building water conservancy projects, and practicing intensive farming, to achieve the region's plan of increasing fine grain production by 200,000 shi across 23 counties. According to the production inspection meeting held on August 17th, there is full confidence in completing this production increase plan. The cultivated land alone has been expanded by more than 1.1 million mu compared to last year, bringing the total cultivated land this year to over 19.36 million mu. The achievements in water conservancy construction are particularly remarkable. The original plan was to restore 387,000 mu of irrigated land. According to statistics from 19 counties, more than 529,000 mu have already been completed, with a total of more than 700 large and small canals opened. It is estimated that water conservancy alone can increase production by more than 63,000 shi. Regarding intensive farming, excellent work was done during the spring plowing. All counties ensured early delivery of manure and increased fertilizer application, and generally achieved timely sowing.

[Taiyuan Dispatch] The 19 counties of central Shanxi Province (formerly the Taiyuan District) have made great achievements in restoring cash crops. A bountiful harvest is expected for cotton, castor beans, and peanuts, totaling more than 437,000 mu. More than 410,000 mu of cotton have been planted, and have been hoed five times, and topping and pinching have been completed early. Most of the plants have finished flowering and are setting fruit, with dense and abundant cotton bolls. If calculated at an average yield of 30 jin of clean cotton per mu, the total yield should be over 12 million jin. A total of 19,000 mu of castor beans and 7,502 mu of peanuts have been planted. For both crops, an average yield of 300 jin per mu can be expected, resulting in a total harvest of 8.25 million jin. The government plans to purchase 3 million jin of cotton in the Central Shanxi region, using 75 percent of the purchase price in essential goods needed by the peasants such as foreign cloth and knitwear, and 25 percent in currency.

　　晋西北今年扩大耕地百万亩
　  增产已有保证
    晋中棉花蓖麻花生可望丰收
    【太原电】山西晋西北地区今春生产会议号召扩大耕地面积，兴修水利，精耕细作，达到全区二十三县增产二十万石细粮的计划，据八月十七日召开的生产检查会议，认为完成此项增产计划已有充分把握。仅耕地一项即比去年扩大一百一十余万亩，使今年总耕地成为一千九百三十六万余亩。兴修水利的成绩尤其显著，原计划恢复水地为三十八万七千亩，现据十九个县的材料统计，即已完成五十二万九千余亩，共开大小水渠七百余道，估计水利一项可增产六万三千余石。精耕细作方面，春耕时作得很好，各县都做到早送粪、多施肥，一般都作到按时下种。
    【太原电】山西省晋中十九县（原太原区）恢复经济作物成绩极大，四十三万七千余亩棉花、蓖麻、花生均可望丰收。棉花共种植四十一万余亩，现已锄过五遍，打杈平顶亦早完成。大部谢花结实，棉桃密茂；若按每亩平均收净花三十斤计，则总计当在一千二百余万市斤以上。蓖麻共种一万九千亩，花生七千五百零二亩，以上两种作物，平均每亩各收三百斤，共可收获八百二十五万市斤。政府拟在晋中区收购棉花三百万市斤，其办法是以百分之七十五农民必需品如洋布、针织品等物换取，另以百分之二十五货币购买。
