(Hangzhou News) The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Material Department, during the Kuomintang rule, relied solely on official documents and telephone communication with its affiliated factories and warehouses, lacking understanding of the storage situation in each facility, and the allocation, purchase, and usage of materials were often unreasonable. After liberation, the relevant responsible persons of the department, together with military representatives, conducted investigations and understanding at the material factories and warehouses along the line in late July, discovering many impractical facilities. For example, the Yingtan material warehouse and the Yushan material factory were established to expedite track laying during the engineering period, but now that the period of road maintenance has arrived, these factories and warehouses have lost their function. The Xiaoshan material warehouse is very close to the Hangzhou material factory, and its warehouse facilities are also relatively poor, so its business can be merged into the Hangzhou factory. The Leping coal receiving station is no longer necessary because most of the coal for the locomotives is supplied by Shanghai. The above institutions, which are not suitable for the current needs, have been abolished or merged. In order to facilitate supply to the many material-using units in the Shangrao area, the material warehouse there has been changed to a material factory. A large number of signal lamps, bedding, paper, stationery, and telecommunications materials stored in the Jinhua material warehouse were decided to be transported to Hangzhou, where these materials were more needed. After the above adjustments, the materials are concentrated, the supply capacity is enhanced, and it is easier for the department to command and communicate both internally and externally. At the same time, during the implementation of the investigation, a lot of usable materials were found. Among them, the Jinhua material warehouse alone had more than 10,000 fishplates, which were set aside as waste because they were not suitable for use on this railway. This time, after an actual investigation by engineers, it was discovered that they were still applicable to most of the rails on this railway. All internal and external custodians were convened to review and improve their work, and to thoroughly overcome the bureaucratic style of being aloof and superior.

　　浙赣铁路材料处
  　深入各厂调查切实清理资财
    【杭州讯】浙赣铁路材料处，在国民党统治时期与所辖各厂库只靠公文和电话联系，对各厂库的储存情况不了解，对材料之调拨、购买、使用多不合理。解放后，该处各有关负责人会同军事代表于七月下旬到沿线各材料厂库进行调查了解，发现很多不切合实际需要的厂库。如鹰潭材料库、玉山材料厂等，过去是根据工程时期赶工钉道而设，现既进入行路养路时期，该厂库已失却作用；萧山材料库距杭州材料厂很近，库房设备亦较差，业务可并入杭州厂；乐平收煤所因路机煤大半是上海供给的已无设立必要。以上不适合目前需要的机构，均分别予以裁撤或合并。上饶区用材料单位较多，为便于供应，已将该处之材料库改为材料厂。金华材料库所存的很多号志灯、被服、纸张、文具、电讯材料，则决定运往更为需用此项材料的杭州。经过以上调整后，材料集中，供应力增强，且使该处内外又便于指挥联络。同时在实施调查中，并发现了不少可用的材料，其中仅存金华材料库的鱼尾板即有一万多块，因在本路不适用，故当废料搁置一边。这次经工程师实际调查，发觉仍适用于本路大多数的钢轨上。召集内外各看管人员，检讨改进工作，彻底克服高高在上的作风。
