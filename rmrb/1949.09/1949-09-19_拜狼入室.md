Letting the Wolf into the House
　　Dong Qian

The traitorous act of "letting the wolf into the house" is "commonplace" in Chinese history. Qin Hui framed Yue Fei at the end of the Song Dynasty and sought peace with the Jin people, which was called "letting the wolf into the house." At the end of the Ming Dynasty, Wu Sangui led the Qing troops into the customs, which was called "letting the wolf into the house." Until 1931, when the Japanese invaders invaded Northeast China, the Kuomintang reactionary leaders Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei advocated "non-resistance," causing the subsequent large-scale invasion of China's mainland by the Japanese invaders, which was also called "letting the wolf into the house." Because this kind of "letting the wolf into the house" is "handed down from ancestors," the "replica" is also lifelike. At the same time, as the name suggests, this so-called "wolf" has already pricked up its ears at the door, stuck out its tongue, and lunged its claws into the room. The "introducer" not only welcomes it into the room, but also goes from "flirting" to "secretly colluding." Doing so is already more than enough to be "contrary to heaven and reason, and against human feelings."

However, these "unreasonable" things, after being manipulated by those experienced "wolf-introducing" experts, will be original and become more and more strange.

Such "ingenuity" is unique to traitors like Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan. When the Chinese people drove away the "wolf" of Japan in eight years of bloodshed and sacrifice, the Chiang and Yan bandits were still reluctant to part with it, but secretly kept the "wolf" alive and continued to "cohabitate," euphemistically calling it "retained Japanese technical personnel." When the Chinese people demanded severe punishment for the "wolf" leader, they had no choice but to secretly send it back to the "wolf's den," euphemistically calling it "repatriating prisoners of war to Japan." However, because the "wolf" has not yet "eaten" all the Chinese people in the past eight years, and the "American wolf" can only "stir up trouble" in the mid-levels, it is inevitable that "old feelings will be rekindled," recalling the old "lover," so they simply sent Wu Tiecheng to the "wolf's den" to "worship the wolf" and "summon a consort," euphemistically calling it "recruiting volunteers" and a new way of "Sino-Japanese cooperation." Wu Tiecheng even coquettishly said: In the past, your unilateral "seeking cooperation" and "rape" were somewhat inelegant. Today, we must "cooperate" voluntarily!

The way of "cohabitation" is certainly more "civilized" and "peaceful" than the way of "rape," and "recruitment" is certainly better to hear, but a wolf is always a wolf, and a dog is always a dog. No matter how it changes, it cannot change the original appearance of the wolf and the dog.

Although "wolves and dogs colluding" is a bit strange, "colluding" is still "colluding," but calling "prostitutes" home is also afraid of being scolded by the world. According to the traitor Shen, the envoy to Japan: "The Allied spokesman said that there is no way to legally make Japanese people mercenaries in the Chinese army" (United Press, Tokyo, August 18). It seems obviously a bit difficult, but since there is an affair, they will simply do it to the end. "A dog jumps over the wall" and finally comes up with the wonderful method of "smuggling." According to reports from various sources: "Most of the 'volunteers' obtained passports to Taiwan in the name of sugar engineers." And "since August 16, some have appeared in Guangzhou."

History has "letting the wolf into the house," and now there is "worshipping the wolf and letting it into the house." If "openness" fails, it turns to "smuggling," which is becoming more and more strange!

However, you "drowning dogs" should not dream of "the water running out and the river drying up." Although the dead "wolf" that has been beaten all over is "injected with blood" by MacArthur, it cannot save its already doomed fate in the face of the powerful Chinese people's strength!

　　拜狼入室
    董谦
    “引狼入室”的卖国勾当，这在中国历史上已“屡见不鲜”。宋末秦桧谋害岳飞，与金人求和，这叫“引狼入室”；明末吴三桂引清兵入关，这叫“引狼入室；”直到一九三一年，日寇侵略东北，国民党反动头子蒋介石、汪精卫之辈，主张“不抵抗主义”、造成以后日寇大规模入侵中国内地，这也叫“引狼入室”；这种“引狼入室”的勾当，因为是“祖传”，“翻版”起来也就维妙维肖。同时顾名思义，这个所谓“狼”者已经在门口竖起耳朵，伸出舌头，爪子扑向室内，“引”者不但把它迎接入室，还由“吊膀子”而到“私通”。这样做已经够十二分“逆乎天理，悖乎人情”了。
    可是这些“逆乎人情”的事情，经那些“引狼”的老行家们一拨弄，就会别出心裁，愈演愈奇了。
    这样的“心裁”正是蒋介石、阎锡山等卖国贼所独有。当中国人民在八年流血牺牲中把日本这只“狼”打走的时候，蒋阎匪贼犹恋恋不舍，却偷偷摸摸地把“狼”养活下来，继续“同居”，美其名曰“留用日技术人员”；当中国人民要求严惩“狼”头的时候，他们才不得不偷偷摸摸地送回“狼窝”，美其名曰“遗送战俘回日”。但是，因为八年来还没叫“狼”把中国人民都“吃”光，“美国狼”又只能在半山凹里“呼风唤雨”，这就难免“旧念复萌”，忆起旧的“恋人”，便索性派吴匪铁城到“狼窝”里“拜狼”“召驸马”了，美其名曰“召募志愿军”、“中日合作”新方式；甚至吴匪铁城还撒娇的说：过去是你单方“求取合作”“强奸”的方式有些失之大雅，今天咱们要双方自愿“合作”哟！
    “同居”的方式固然比“强奸”的方式“文明”“和平”，“召募”固然也好听一些，可是狼总是狼，狗总是狗，变来变去也变不了狼狗原相。
    虽说“狼狗为奸”有些怪离，但“奸”还是要“奸”，不过召“嫖客”到家，又怕世人唾骂，据驻日公使沈匪称：“盟总发言人称，没有办法可使日人合法地成为中国军队的雇佣兵，”（合众社东京八月十八日电）。看来显然觉得有点为难，可是既有奸情，也就不做不休了，“狗急跳墙”，终于别出心裁，想出了“走私”的妙法，据各方消息报导：“大部分‘志愿兵’都以制糖工程师名义获得赴台湾的护照。”而且“从八月十六日起已有一部分在广州出现。”
    史有“引狼入室”，今有“拜狼入室”，“公开”不成，竟而“走私”，真是愈演愈奇了！
    可是，你们这些“落水狗”却不要梦想“水尽河干”，那个已被打得遍体鳞伤的死“狼”，虽经麦克阿瑟的“注血”，但在强大的中国人民力量面前，也无法挽救它业已注定死亡的命运！
