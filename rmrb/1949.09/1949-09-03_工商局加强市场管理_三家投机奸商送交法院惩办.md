The Industry and Commerce Bureau Strengthens Market Management
Three Speculative Profiteers Sent to Court for Punishment

[This City News] In order to strengthen market management and strictly ban the illegal activities of profiteering merchants, the Beiping Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce conducted a comprehensive inspection in early August in cooperation with the Taxation Bureau, banks and other agencies, which played a considerable role in curbing the illegal activities of profiteering merchants and stabilizing prices. The bureau recently announced that Huachang Military Uniform Bureau in this city hoarded a large amount of flour, Quanxing Grain Store purchased grain from the trade company for speculation, and Yu＠ Grain Store resold gold and silver. The circumstances were serious, and it has been submitted to the People's Court for punishment according to law. The speculative activities of the respective firms are reported as follows:

(1) Huachang Military Uniform Bureau hoarded a large amount of grain and cloth. The firm undertook the production of uniforms for the Ministry of Railways for a total of 231 million yuan, and used this huge sum to purchase flour and other items not needed by the firm in the market for hoarding and speculation. The firm purchased 720 bags of flour on July 28. On August 4, the market price of grain had already fallen, but Huachang still entrusted Changtaishi and other grain stores to purchase in large quantities inside and outside the market. On August 4, 2,175 bags were purchased, and on the 5th, 600 bags were purchased. Hoarding and speculation disrupted grain prices. In total, the firm purchased 3,785 bags of flour, totaling 170,325 jin, from July 15 to August 5. In addition, there were also large rice, millet flour, etc. and 2,119 bolts of cloth, and 292 pieces of yarn.

In addition, the 950 bolts of white cloth that were sealed during this inspection were used by the firm without applying for government permission. Neglecting laws and regulations, speculating and hoarding, should be sent to court for handling.

(2) Quanxing Grain Store purchased grain from the trade company for sale in the market, engaging in speculative reselling. Since March, the firm has continuously purchased grain from the trade company, entrusting Tongyixing to purchase 47,800 jin, and Jiucheng Yongdai to purchase 12,000 jin. By early May, a total of 140,240 jin of grain had been purchased. After the government discovered this, the firm's manager, Cha Hongkui, changed his methods. His father, Cai Runquan, opened a Yihexing Rice and Flour Shop to obtain legal status to purchase grain in the market, and continued to purchase grain from the trade company through Yihexing. In total, from the opening of Yihexing on May 10 to August 2, a total of 237,400 jin of millet, 77,200 jin of sorghum rice, and 4,000 jin of corn were purchased from the trade company, accounting for two-thirds of its total purchases. Yihexing provided grain to Quanxing Grain Store at any time for sale in the grain market in Simianzhong. For example, on May 20, 6,000 jin of red sorghum purchased from the trade company was sold. From July 1 to 18, Yihexing allocated 8,750 jin of grain to Quanxing Grain Store. The above facts prove that Quanxing Grain Store purely used the Yihexing name to purchase grain from the trade company and engage in speculative reselling activities, violating government laws and regulations and fueling price fluctuations. Quanxing Grain Store also falsely reported capital. Although the Bureau of Industry and Commerce had educated them, they did not know how to repent and continued to carry out illegal activities. In addition to revoking the business license of Yihexing Rice and Flour Shop and suspending business, Quanxing Grain Store was sent to court for handling.

(3) Yu＠ Grain Store resold gold and silver. Since January, a total of 27.23 taels of gold have been purchased, and a total of 31.479 taels have been sold, including the previous balance. 1,392 yuan of silver dollars were purchased, with a total of 1,461 yuan including the previous balance. In addition, a leak of 9,000 yuan in stamp duty was found, and 3.9 million yuan in grain converted from commercial tax was unreported from February to June. The firm's buying and selling of gold and silver disrupted financial prices. In addition to the tax evasion part being sent to the Taxation Bureau for handling, the entire case was sent to court for handling.

　　工商局加强市场管理
  　三家投机奸商送交法院惩办
    【本市讯】北平市工商局为加强市场管理，严格取缔奸商投机之非法活动，曾在八月初与税务局、银行等机关配合进行了普遍的检查工作，对于制止奸商的非法活动和稳定物价上起了相当作用。该局顷宣布本市华昌军装局大量囤积面粉，泉兴粮栈套购贸易公司粮食，投机倒把，钰＠粮栈倒卖金银，情节严重，已提请人民法院依法惩办。兹将各该商号之投机活动报导如下：
    （一）华昌军装局大量囤积粮布。该号承做铁道部服装共二亿三千一百万元，即以此项巨款在市场上购买面粉等非该号所需之物品，囤积居奇。该号曾于七月二十八日买进面粉七二○袋。八月四日，市场粮价本已下跌；但华昌仍委托长泰石等数家粮店在市场内外大批收购。八月四日买二一七五袋，五日买六○○袋。囤积居奇，扰乱粮价。总计该号自七月十五日至八月五日止共购进面粉三七八五袋共一七○、三二五斤。此外，并有大米、小米面等及布二、一一九匹，纱二九二块。
    又此次检查中予以封冻之九五○匹白布，该号竟未呈请政府许可，擅自动用七八○匹。玩忽法令，投机囤积，应送法院处理。
    （二）泉兴粮栈套购贸易公司粮食在市场上出卖，投机倒把。该号自三月份以来，即不断套购贸易公司粮食，曾托同益兴购买四七、八○○斤，久成永代购一二、○○○斤。至五月初先后共套购粮食一四○、二四○斤。经政府发觉后，该号经理察鸿逵即改变方式，由其父蔡润泉，另开设一义合兴米面庄，以取得合法的在市场上购粮之身份，继续通过义合兴套购贸易公司粮食。总计义合兴自五月十日开张营业，至八月二日止共套购贸易公司小米一五六、二○○斤，高粱米七七、二○○斤，玉米四千斤，共计二三七、四○○斤，占其全部购进量的三分之二。义合兴随时将粮食给泉兴粮栈，在四面钟粮食市场上出售。如五月二十日卖出由贸易公司套购的红粮六千斤，七月一日至十八日，义合兴拨给泉兴粮栈的粮食有八七五○斤，以上事实证明泉兴粮栈纯系利用义合兴字号套购贸易公司粮食，进行投机倒把活动，违犯政府法令，助长物价波动。泉兴粮栈并曾虚报资本，虽早经工商局予以教育，仍不知改悔，继续进行违法活动。除将义合兴米面庄营业执照吊销，停止营业外，泉兴粮栈送法院处理。
    （三）钰＠粮栈倒卖金银。自一月以来共买入黄金二七·二三两，连前结存共卖出三一·四七九两。购入银元一三九二元，连前结存一四六一元。此外尚查出漏贴印花税九千元，二月至六月漏报未纳行商税之粮食折款三百九十万元。该号买卖金银，扰乱金融物价，除漏税部分送税务局处理外，全案送法院处理。
