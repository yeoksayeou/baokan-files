　　Jingdezhen, Jiangxi Province, Porcelain Industry Moves from Ruin to Revival
　　
　　The porcelain industry in Jingdezhen, Jiangxi Province, which is famous throughout the country, has resumed production and is rapidly increasing its output with smooth sales due to the thorough work of our Party and government personnel and the active support of the People's Government. It is currently experiencing raw material shortages and urgently needs the rapid resumption of production at porcelain raw material manufacturing plants in various locations. The porcelain industry holds a dominant position in Jingdezhen's economy, and the prosperity or decline of porcelain production and sales affects the prosperity or decline of other industries and commerce in the city. As a result of the reactionary rule, the local porcelain industry was in a state of dilapidation before liberation. Except for a few kiln factories such as Yu Zhaohua, which were barely operating, all the others were shut down, and almost all the workers were unemployed. Since the liberation of Jingdezhen, the city's Party and government work has focused on supporting the resumption of porcelain production as one of its main tasks. First, we explained the policies of developing production and mutual benefit for labor and capital to the workers and carried out class education. At the same time, we explained our Party's policy of protecting and developing industry and commerce to the major kiln owners and called on them to resume work. At this time, because the sales channels had not yet been opened, the porcelain industry was temporarily unprofitable, and only some factory owners recognized that the porcelain industry would inevitably move towards prosperity and felt optimistic, so they resolutely resumed work. Some factories were still unwilling to resume work. In the second step, our working cadres led workers and capitalists to negotiate together, persuading the capitalists to recognize the future and not to hesitate to wait and see, but to resume work immediately. At the same time, the workers also took the initiative to make concessions to the capitalists, proposing that wages could be calculated at 80% of the original wage in rice, and allowing the factory to owe a portion of wages. Because the factories of the carved ware workers were small kiln owners, they voluntarily proposed that wages be calculated at 60% of the past wage in rice. This took care of the capitalists so that they had appropriate profits, which facilitated the rapid resumption of work, increased production, and relieved the suffering of worker unemployment. Through the efforts of all parties, by the end of July, most of the large factory owners with strong capital and raw materials had resumed work, and the production mood was relatively stable. A total of 46 porcelain kilns have resumed work, with 812 workers; 711 roughcast factories for round and carved wares have resumed work, with 4,139 workers. In the initial stage of resuming work, the leadership only paid attention to the resumption of roughcast factories, and neglected the resumption of kiln factories, so that more than 700 roughcast factories resumed work, but very few kiln factories resumed work, so that the number of roughcast products produced was very large, with no place to store them and no place to fire them. As a result, the roughcast factories urgently demanded that the kiln owners start firing. At this time, the Bureau of Industry and Commerce also cooperated with the preparatory committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions to convene a meeting of kiln owners, roughcast ware owners, and kiln workers to discuss how to promote the resumption of work by kiln owners. Based on the current situation that kiln owners are unprofitable, and some are even losing money, the kiln factories and roughcast factories negotiated, and both sides, based on the principle of mutual care, jointly agreed that the roughcast factories should pay 2,000 yuan (People's Currency) for each load of roughcast to be fired on behalf of the kiln factories so that the kiln factories would also be slightly profitable. After the meeting, most of the kiln owners quickly resumed work. With the gradual resolution of the problem of resuming work, the government actively sought to open up sales channels for porcelain. It has successively held several symposiums with porcelain merchants and porcelain firms to solicit opinions and study decisions. The government has taken active actions, such as frequently sending armed escorts for porcelain merchants to transport porcelain for export, suppressing bandits and special agents along the way, purchasing a large amount of porcelain to transport to Beijing and Shanghai for sale, supporting small vendors to transport porcelain to other areas for sale, and contacting other liberated areas to negotiate material exchanges. As a result, porcelain sales have become increasingly widespread. It is estimated that more than 800 loads were shipped out in May, more than 2,000 loads in June, more than 10,000 loads in July, and more than 9,000 loads were shipped out in one instance on the morning of August 9th. Excluding the small quantities transported by cars and shoulder poles, more than 10,000 loads were shipped out in the previous and subsequent days. Recently, the Municipal Trading Company purchased 4 million yuan of porcelain for promotion in Shanghai. A telegram has already been received from Shanghai stating that all of it has been sold smoothly, and if there is more porcelain, it can still be sold smoothly. Recently, the main sales areas are Jiujiang, Wuhan, Beijing, Shanghai, Zhejiang and other places. In recent days, the Changjiang Wharf in the urban area has been bustling with people busy loading porcelain for shipment; merchants from all over the world have been coming to purchase porcelain in an endless stream. Merchants come from Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, Suzhou, Wuhu, Bengbu and other places. According to reports, porcelain shops in major cities have mostly sold out and are urgently awaiting large quantities of supply. It is also said that because our work of suppressing bandits has been carried out rapidly, bandits and special agents between Poyang and Jingdezhen have almost disappeared, and merchants and travelers are safe, so on the 9th, porcelain merchants set sail for Poyang City without waiting for our army to escort them. However, with the problem of porcelain sales basically solved, the problems of raw materials and fuel urgently need to be solved next. The glaze fruit used in Jingdezhen porcelain comes from Dongxiang County, the "Buzi" comes from Qimen, Yugan and other counties, and the white clay also comes from the surrounding counties. The manufacturing plants for the above raw materials had almost all stopped working due to the previous porcelain industry slump. Even the firewood needed for firing kilns is also experiencing difficulties because those in the surrounding villages who made kiln firewood had mostly changed careers due to the previous stagnation of sales. In the future, if we want to meet market needs and manufacture porcelain in large quantities, all these raw material manufacturers should resume work as soon as possible.

　　江西景德市瓷业由残破走向复兴
    各地通讯
    名闻全国的江西景德市的瓷器业，解放后由于我党政工作人员深入进行工作，人民政府积极扶植，现已纷纷复工，产量激增，销路顺畅；目前已感原料困难，急需各地瓷器原料制造厂迅速复工。按瓷业在景德市经济上占主导地位，瓷器产销盛衰影响全市其他工、商业的兴旺与萧条。反动派统治结果，至解放前，该地瓷业已呈残败不堪状态，除余昭华等个别窑厂尚勉强开工外，其余全部停工，工人几将全部失业。自从景市解放后，全市党政工作均以扶植瓷业复工生产为主要工作之一。首先先向工人讲解发展生产、劳资两利的政策，进行阶级教育；同时向大窑户讲解我党保护与发展工商业政策，号召他们复工。这时，因为销路尚未打开，瓷业暂时无利可图，只有一部分厂主认清了瓷业必将走向繁荣，感到乐观，乃决然复工，有一部分厂还不愿复工。第二步，我工作干部又领导工人与资本家共同协商，劝导资方认清前途，不要犹豫观望，应立即复工；同时工人并主动向资方让步，提出工资可按原工资米数打八折，允许厂方欠发一部工资。琢器工人因为厂方是小窑户，就自动提出按过去工资米数打六折来算工资。这样照顾资方，使其有适当利润，以便于迅速复工，增加生产，解除工人失业的痛苦。经过各方面的努力，至七月底，凡是资本雄厚、有原料的大厂主，绝大部分都复了工，生产情绪也比较安定。计复工的瓷窑共四十六座，工人八一二名；圆、琢器坯厂复工的七一一个，工人四一三九名。在复工工作初期，领导上曾只注意了坯厂的复工，而忽视了窑厂的复工，以致七百多个坯厂复了工，而窑厂复工的很少，使坯厂生产坯胎数量甚大，无处存放，亦无处去烧。于是，坯厂便急切要求烧窑户开烧。这时，工商局又配合市总工会筹委会召集烧窑户、坯器户、窑厂工人开会，协商如何促进烧窑户复工问题。根据目前窑户无利可图，且有的赔钱的情况，窑厂与坯厂协商，双方本互相照顾原则，共同议定代烧一担坯应由坯厂出人民币二千元，以使窑厂也稍微有利可图。会后，大部烧窑户便很快复了工。随着复工问题的逐渐解决，政府积极设法打开瓷器销路。先后曾召开数次瓷商瓷行座谈会，征询意见，研究决策。政府采取的积极行动，如经常派武装掩护瓷商转运瓷器出口，剿灭沿途匪特；收买大量瓷器运赴京沪出售；扶植小商贩运瓷器到外区出售；与其他解放区联络，商订物资交流。因此，瓷器销路日广。计五月份运出八百余担；六月份运出两千余担；七月份运出一万余担；八月九日上午一次即运出九千多担，除去汽车与担挑零星外运不计，前后数日内即运出一万多担。日前市贸易公司曾收购四百万元的瓷器赴沪推销，已自沪来电称，全部顺利售出，如再有瓷器，仍可顺利销售。最近主要销路为九江、武汉、京沪、浙江等地。数日来，市区昌江码头上终日人群扰攘，忙于装运瓷器外出；各路商人前来购瓷者，络绎不绝。商人来自京沪、武汉、苏州、芜湖、蚌埠等地。据谈，目前各大中城市瓷器店多已售罄，急待大量供应。又据称，因我剿匪工作迅速开展，鄱阳与景市之间匪特几已敛迹，商旅安全无虑，故九日即有瓷商不等我军掩护，即开船向鄱市出发。但在目前瓷器销路问题大体解决的情况下，继之而来的是原料问题与燃料问题又迫切需要解决。缘景市制瓷所用之釉果出自东乡县，不子出自祁门、余干等县，白土亦出自四周各县。以上各种原料制造厂，前以瓷业萧条，几已全部停工。即烧窑所需之木柴，亦因前曾销路滞塞，四乡做窑柴者多已转业，目前亦感受困难。今后如欲供应市场需要，大量制造瓷品，凡此种种原料制造者则极应迅速复工。
