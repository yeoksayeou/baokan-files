　　Striving for Peace, Democracy, National Independence and a Bright Future for Youth
    —Summary of Speech by Mikhailov, Head of the Soviet Delegation, at the Second World Youth Congress on September 4
  　Soviet Union—Hope of All Mankind
    The enemies of the Soviet people, the enemies of peace and democracy—the Anglo-American imperialists and their lackeys—are spreading the most incredible lies and slanders about the Soviet Union in pursuit of their despicable aims, trying to portray the Soviet Union as an aggressive country. However, the number of people who believe these lies and slanders is decreasing day by day. Millions of progressive people deeply know that the Soviet Union is the most loyal, sincere, and resolute defender of peace and friendship among nations, and a beacon and hope for all mankind. No amount of lies and slanders can diminish it.
    Since the war, Soviet youth have cultivated a new batch of outstanding industrial production reformers, improved many production technologies, and better organized people's labor. In agriculture, more than 800 young men and women have been awarded the title of Hero of Socialist Labor for their achievements. Eight thousand young collective farmers have been awarded the Order of Lenin and the Order of the Red Banner of Labor for their selfless labor.
    In the Soviet Union, there are nearly 34 million students in primary, seven-year, and secondary schools. This year, universal compulsory seven-year education is being implemented throughout the country. In 1946, the number of students in higher education institutions had already exceeded the pre-war level, and the restoration of the pre-war higher education institution network had been largely completed. Now, there are over one million students in higher education institutions. In 1949 alone, over 60 billion rubles were allocated from the state budget for people's education.
    Night schools, which have been established in recent years, are of great importance to Soviet youth. More than 300,000 young workers are receiving seven-year and secondary education in night schools.
    The entire expenses of 771,969 students in vocational schools and factory-affiliated schools are entirely provided by the state. In the course of eight years, more than 4.5 million young men and women have graduated from vocational schools and factory-affiliated schools.
    The Soviet state constantly cares about the development of literature and art, which plays a significant role in cultivating youth. The Soviet Union has more than 110,000 cultural centers, cultural palaces, clubs, and reading rooms; more than 60,000 libraries with a total collection of 132 million volumes; and more than 800 theaters. All of this fully serves the Soviet youth.
    This year, the Soviet state budget has allocated 119.2 billion rubles for social and cultural services, an increase of 12.9 percent compared to 1948. The allocation for social and cultural services accounts for 34.8 percent of the total budget.
    However, on the other hand, in 1948, the United States' education expenditure only accounted for 1.6 percent of the budget, while the expenditure for armed forces accounted for 32 percent; in Britain, the former accounted for 4.7 percent, and the latter accounted for 25 percent; in France, it was 6 percent and 32 percent respectively. These materials once again prove who is following a policy of peace and who is following a policy of war. No lies from the Anglo-American reactionaries and their lackeys can hide this truth.
    The Soviet state, trade unions, and other public organizations spend hundreds of millions of rubles annually for the development of sports, construction and restoration of stadiums, manufacturing of sports equipment, and opening of sports colleges and schools. More than 700 sports schools for children and 150 sports schools for youth have been established to help young people achieve a high level of proficiency in sports.
    This year, Soviet athletes have set 113 new all-Soviet records. In the recently concluded World Student Games, Soviet athletes won 187 medals, including 115 gold medals, 42 silver medals, and 30 bronze medals.
    In the Soviet state, sports have acquired a truly mass, universal character. The socialist state pays great attention to the health care of the working people. This year alone, more than 2 million people have received medical treatment in sanatoriums and rest homes. Young workers enjoy equal rights with adults in terms of holiday sickness benefits and free accommodation in sanatoriums and rest homes, and in some cases, they are even given priority.
    One of the noble traditions of Soviet society is the nationwide concern for children. In 1948, more than 4 million children spent their summer vacations in Young Pioneer camps and traveling camps, etc.
    The Soviet people proudly call the young generation of the socialist country the Stalin generation. Soviet youth are educated and cultured youth who embrace lofty ideals, grand plans, and a spirit of bold creation. Soviet youth deeply believe in tomorrow and move forward confidently to meet it. Soviet young men and women are filled with ardent Soviet patriotism; and remember the name of the great leader and teacher Comrade Stalin with deep love in their hearts.
    American and British Imperialism - The Main Enemy of the People and Youth
    The gradual decline in living standards, the tragedy of hunger and unemployment, the shame of mankind, the mad and unbridled propaganda of new wars, these are the situations in the United States, Britain and other capitalist countries.
    The Anglo-American reactionaries - this is the main enemy of youth. Imperialism is stained with the blood of the working people. The war against the German fascist aggressors had hardly ended when imperialism threw people into wars again in Indonesia, Vietnam, Greece and Malaya.
    Imperialism not only cruelly exploits adults, but also cruelly exploits youth, even children. In many places dominated by capitalism, employers extract every drop of blood possible from children as young as seven or eight years old, even resorting to such sordid and despicable acts as child trafficking. Imperialism is destroying humanity like a terrible plague or @ ulcer. In India, one in four infants under the age of one dies. Imperialism deprives men and women of their jobs. Millions of people are faced with the terrible tragedy of unemployment, they curse imperialism, and are increasingly convinced that they must fight to win a better life.

　　为和平民主民族独立与青年的美好将来而斗争
    ——苏联代表团团长米哈依洛夫九月四日
    在第二次世界青年代表大会上的演说摘要
  　苏联—全人类的希望
    苏联人民的敌人，和平与民主的敌人——英美帝国主义者及其从仆们，为了追逐他们卑劣的目的，正在散布关于苏联的最不足信的谎言与诽谤，力图把苏联说成侵略的国家。但是，听信这些谎言与诽谤的人，正一天天减少。千百万进步的广大人民群众深知苏联是和平与各民族友谊的最忠实、最诚挚、最坚决的保卫者，是全人类的灯塔与希望。任何大量的谎言与诽谤，都不能使它减色。
    战后，苏联青年已从他们的队伍中培养出一批新的卓越的工业生产改革者，改进了许多生产技术，并更好地组织了人们的劳动。在农业方面，也有八百多名男女青年建立了功绩而荣获社会主义劳动英雄的称号。八千名年青的集体农民，因为无我劳动而荣获列宁勋章和劳动红旗勋章。
    在苏联，初等、七年制和中等学校的学生将近有三千四百万名。今年，普遍强迫的七年制教育正在全国各地实行。在一九四六年，高等教育机关的学生数目就已超过战前水平，而战前高等教育机关网的复兴工作，则已大体上完成。现在，高等学校的学生超过了一百万。仅在一九四九年一年，就已从国家预算中拨出六百亿余卢布作为人民教育的经费。
    对苏联青年具有巨大重要性的，就是在这些年中所设立的夜校。有三十万以上的青年工人在夜校中受了七年制与中等教育。
    有七七一、九六九名职业学校与工厂附设学校的学生的全部费用完全由国家供给。在八年过程中，从职业学校与工厂附设学校中毕业的青年男女，共达四百五十万以上。
    苏维埃国家经常关怀对培育青年起着重大作用的文学艺术的发展。苏联计有十一万多个文化之家、文化宫、俱乐部与阅览室；六万多个藏书共一亿三千二百万卷的图书馆和八百多个剧院。所有这一切，都充分地为苏联青年服务。
    今年，苏联的国家预算拨了一千一百九十二亿卢布作为社会与文化服务之用，这比一九四八年增加百分之一二点九。社会与文化服务的拨款占全部预算的百分之三十四点八。
    但是，另一方面，在一九四八年，美国的教育经费仅占预算的百分之一点六，而武装部队的经费则占百分之三十二；在英国前者占百分之四点七，而后者占百分之二十五；在法国则是百分之六和百分之三十二，这些材料再一次证明了谁遵循着和平的政策，而谁遵循着战争的政策。英美反动派及其从仆们任何希图遮掩的谎言，都是不能隐蔽这一真象的。
    苏维埃国家、职工会和其他公共团体，每年支出亿万卢布，供发展体育、建筑与恢复运动场、制造体育用品、和开办体育学院与学校之用。七百余所为儿童而设的运动学校和一百五十所为青年而设的运动学校已经建立，以帮助青年们在运动方面达到高度精通的程度。
    今年，苏联运动员已树立了一一三种新的全苏纪录。在最近结束的世界学生运动会中，苏联运动员赢得了一八七个奖牌，其中包括一一五个金奖牌，四十二个银奖牌和三十个青铜奖牌。
    在苏维埃国家里，运动已获得了真正群众性的、普遍的特性。社会主义国家对于劳动人民的保健付以极大的注意。只是本年，在疗养院和休养所进行医疗的就有二百余万人。在假期疾病福利与免费住疗养院和休养所方面，青年工人与成年享有平等的权利，且在若干情况下甚至给予优先权。
    苏维埃社会的高尚的传统之一，是全国性地关心儿童。一九四八年，四百余万儿童在少年先锋队营和旅行队营等等地方消度暑假。
    苏联人民骄傲地称社会主义国家的年青的一代，是斯大林的一代。苏联青年是有教养有文化的青年，他们怀抱着崇高的理想、远大的计划和勇往直前的创造精神。苏联青年深深相信着明天，并满怀信心地向前迈进迎接明天。苏联男女青年充满着热诚的苏维埃爱国主义；并以深深的热爱在他们的心中怀念着伟大的领袖和导师斯大林同志的名字。
    美英帝国主义——人民和青年的主要敌人
    生活水准的逐步降低，饥饿与失业的悲剧，人类的耻辱，疯狂放肆的新战争的宣传，这些就是美国、英国及其他资本主义国家的情况。
    英美反动派——这是青年的主要敌人。帝国主义沾满了劳动人民的血。反对德国法西斯侵略者的战争几乎还没有结束的时候，帝国主义便在印尼、越南、希腊和马来亚各地又把人们投进战争里去了。
    帝国主义不但残酷地剥削成年人，而且也残酷地剥削青年，甚至于儿童。在受资本主义支配的许多地方，雇主从七八岁的儿童身上榨取可能榨出来的每一滴血，甚至不惜做出贩卖儿童这种卑陋龌龊的丑行。帝国主义正象可怕的疫疠或＠疡一样，毁灭着人类。在印度，一岁以下的婴孩在四人当中就有一个死亡。帝国主义剥夺了男人和女人的职业。千百万人遭遇到失业的可怖的悲剧，他们咒诅着帝国主义，并越来越深信必须靠斗争才能赢得较美好的生活。
