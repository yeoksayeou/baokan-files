　　American Continent Representatives
  　Continue to Condemn US Imperialism's Warmongering, Expressing Firm Support for Peace
    Costa Rican representative Fallas said: If the people of the American continents prove their determination not to go to war, then those who are preparing for new wars and want to use us as cannon fodder will be forced to abandon their evil plans. The President of the Cuban Popular Socialist Party and member of the World Peace Defenders Committee, Marinello, said: The Mexico City Conference proved that the struggle against the threats of US imperialists to the freedom, democracy, peace and welfare of the American countries should lie in organizing and strengthening peace movements in various countries, and establishing peace defenders committees in various places, factories and social groups. The head of the Brazilian delegation, Congressman and editor of the Rio de Janeiro newspaper "People's Forum," Pomar, pointed out: The growing support of the people for the plans and activities of the Paris World Peace Council demonstrates to the world that the peace force headed by the Soviet Union is invincible. "The Brazilian people will not participate in any war of aggression against any other nation, let alone a war against the Soviet Union." Panamanian youth leader Yulada also strongly condemned US imperialism. He said: The Panama Canal Zone "is ruled by a military junta that obeys the most reactionary forces of American imperialism. There exists a shameful and unbearable racial discrimination. Under this racial discrimination, only white North Americans can get decent salaries, and we Latin Americans are judged to only get dirty shacks and starvation wages." He said: The Panama Canal Zone is also a center for training various Latin American reactionaries. "American imperialism uses armed aggression, economic aggression, and political interference against us." Yulada demanded the demilitarization of the Canal Zone to "remove the danger hanging over Latin America."
    The anti-Soviet remarks made by John Roach, Vice Chairman of the Standing Peace Committee in Paris, at the meeting aroused the indignation and protests of the representatives.
    At the closing session, Wallace's telegram to the conference from US Progressive Party leader Wallace was read. The telegram stated: "The people of the world are calling for peace. He will continue to fight for peace until fascist terror and its atrocities disappear from the earth." The conference also listened to the recording brought by Mrs. Robertson of Mr. Robertson’s address to the congress, and a congratulatory telegram from Chaplin.

　　美洲各国代表
  　续斥美帝挑拨战争表示坚决拥护和平
    哥斯达黎加代表法拉斯说：如果美洲各国人民证明他们决心不走向战争，那么，那些正准备新战争想把我们作炮灰的人，将被迫放弃他们的罪恶计划。古巴人民社会党主席与世界和平保卫者委员会委员马利涅洛说：墨西哥城大会证明了美帝国主义者威胁着美洲各国的自由、民主和平与福利的斗争应在于组织与加强各国和平运动，和在各地、各工厂和社会团体中成立和平保卫者委员会。巴西代表团团长国会议员与里约热内卢报纸“人民论坛”报编辑波马尔指出：人民对于巴黎世界和平委员会的计划和活动的越来越大的支持，向全世界说明了以苏联为首的和平力量是不可战胜的。“巴西人民将不参加反对任何其他民族的征服战争，更不参加反苏的战争。”巴拿马青年领袖尤拉达也猛烈谴责美帝国主义。他说：巴拿马运河区“被听命于美国帝国主义最反动力量的军事阀阅制度所统治着。那里存在着可耻的不堪忍受的种族歧视。在这种种族歧视下，只有北美的白人才能得到象样子的薪水，我们拉丁美洲人被判定只能得到肮脏的茅屋和挨饿的工资。”他说：巴拿马运河区也是训练各种拉丁美洲反动分子的中心“美国帝国主义对我们使用武装侵略、经济侵略和政治干涉。”尤拉达要求运河区非军事化，以“除去悬在拉丁美洲头上的危险”。
    巴黎常设和平委员会副主席约翰·罗奇在会上的反苏谈话，激起代表们的愤慨和抗议。
    在闭幕会上，宣读了美国进步党领袖华莱士致大会的电文。该电文称：“世界人民呼吁和平。他将继续为和平而战斗，直到法西斯恐怖及其暴行在地面上消逝为止。”大会并听取罗伯逊夫人带来的罗伯逊致大会的录音片及卓别麟的贺电。
