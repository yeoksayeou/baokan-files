　　Land Administration Bureau Achieves Success in First Collective Mediation of Housing Disputes

　　[This Municipality News] The Municipal People's Government Land Administration Bureau achieved remarkable results in its first collective mediation of housing rental disputes on the 5th of this month. There were a total of seventeen disputes, all of which had been transferred to the Land Administration Bureau after unsuccessful mediation by the district offices. These disputes between landlords and tenants mostly arose from disagreements over rent negotiations and the repayment of arrears, while some were caused by mere spite on both sides. The Land Administration Bureau analyzed the specific circumstances of each dispute, and with reference to past mediation experience and the opinions of the district offices, organized the mediation personnel, made specific divisions of labor, and proceeded separately by combining collective persuasion mediation with individual persuasion mediation methods. As a result, in one and a half days of mediation, agreements were reached in twelve cases, while agreements could not be reached in five cases. In the past, because mediation was done on a case-by-case basis, the effort was scattered, and on average only three cases could be handled per day.

　　Among the five disputes in which agreements could not be reached, one was because the landlord raised the rent too high and refused to compromise, while the remaining four were because the tenants were unwilling to pay a reasonable rent or demanded excessive moving expenses. For example, He Changsheng rented two adobe rooms from Li Yangshi, owing rent for as long as thirteen months, and refused to pay out of spite. In the newly agreed rent, the landlord only asked for ten catties of millet per room, while the tenant insisted on only giving five catties. After the landlord automatically reduced it to eight catties on the spot, the mediators spoke to the tenant alone for two hours, but to no avail. He Changsheng even said: "If you can't mediate, you can transfer it to the court." According to the Land Administration Bureau, in the face of this attitude of deliberately "dragging" and "stalling," and refusing to solve problems reasonably, the relevant government departments, after unsuccessful persuasion and mediation, can only transfer them to the court for a judgment in accordance with the law.

　　地政局处理房屋纠纷首次集体调解获成绩
    【本市讯】本市人民政府地政局于本月五日第一次集体调解房屋租赁纠纷，获得了显著的成绩。纠纷一共十七件，都是经过各区区公所调解不成而转到地政局来处理的。这些房东与房客的纠纷，多半是在租金的议定和欠租的偿还问题上发生了争执，也有双方仅因负气而引起的。地政局分析了纠纷的个别情况，并参照着过去调解的经验和各区公所的意见，组织了参加调解的人员，具体分工，结合集体说服调解与个别说服调解的方法，分头进行。结果在一天半的调解中，获得协议的有十二件，未能成立协议的有五件。过去因为是逐件调解把力量分散，每日平均只能处理三件。
    不能成立协议的五件纠纷中，除有一件是因为房东把租提得太高，不肯让步外，其余四件都是房客不愿拿出合理的租金，或索要过多的搬家费所致。例如，何长生租住李杨氏的灰房二间，欠租有十三个月之久，负气不给，而新定租约中，房东每间只要十斤小米，房客则坚持只给五斤，房东当场自动减为八斤后，调解人员单独和房客说了两个钟头，仍然毫无效果，何长生并且说：“你们调解不了，可以转法院”。据地政局表示，这种故意抱着“拖”“泡”，不肯合理解决问题的态度，人民政府主管部门于说服调解无效后，只有转送法院依法判决。
