    [From our city] The Ping Cooperative Bank Business Department's loan work in August achieved considerable success in developing agricultural production in suburban areas, handicraft production in the city, and cooperating with the Beijing Supply and Marketing Cooperative to facilitate the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas. Agricultural loans in August totaled 714,055 yuan, mainly to help farmers replant late rice and solve problems related to fertilizer and draft animals. Handicraft loans were granted to 114 households, totaling 21,803,060 yuan, with the weaving industry accounting for the largest share at 51%, agricultural implements at 13%, knitting at 12%, copper wire mesh at 6%, and other industries such as fertilizer, flour milling, oil pressing, grinding, shoes and hats, and chemicals accounting for 18%. The primary target of handicraft loans was to meet the needs of farmers, followed by daily necessities for urban consumption. In terms of cooperative loans, 2,978,743 yuan were loaned out in August, with the Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative accounting for 84%. The cooperative used the loans to purchase 500,000 jin of wheat seeds, 1,000,000 jin of millet, 300,000 jin of bean cake, 200,000 jin of green hemp, and 800 jin of red letter paper, with the remainder used to purchase cloth, cigarettes, and coal to supply members. This played a significant role in connecting urban and rural trade and ensuring the livelihood of the working people.
    In addition, the Business Department of the bank has the following work plan for September: 1. To work with the Suburban Work Committee to arrange for this year's autumn loans and begin issuing them. 2. To continue to collect and inspect handicraft loans and issue new ones. 3.
