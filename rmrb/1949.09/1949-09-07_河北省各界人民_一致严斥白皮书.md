　　People from All Walks of Life in Hebei Province
  　Unanimously Denounce the White Paper
    [Baoding Telegram] The American imperialist White Paper has aroused strong condemnation from the people of Hebei Province. On August 25th, the Hebei Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League, the Preparatory Committee of the Hebei Women's Federation and other people's organizations, as well as the People's Representatives Conference of Baoding City, issued statements, unanimously holding that the White Paper exposes the hideous face of American imperialism's continued aggression against the Chinese people. The statement of the Hebei Provincial Federation of Trade Unions said: We must, together with our class brothers all over the world, thoroughly smash all aggressive conspiracies of American imperialism. We must strive to produce and provide disaster relief, vigorously practice saving raw materials, reducing costs, and increasing production, support the People's Liberation Army in swiftly wiping out the remaining forces of the Kuomintang reactionaries, and resolutely smash the economic blockade of the American Chiang clique, so as to give a powerful response to the White Paper. The statement of the People's Representatives Conference of Baoding City stated: No matter how cleverly the White Paper conceals the sinister intentions of American imperialism's aggression, we have recognized its true face to the core. The 100,000 citizens of Baoding will not forget the rule and destruction of the people by the Chiang bandits in Baoding under the support of the American imperialists. Finally, it proposed: In order to carry the revolution through to the end, unite the peace-loving people of the world, especially standing closely with the great socialist country of the Soviet Union, to oppose any imperialist aggressive ambitions, Hebei Province and Baoding City should quickly establish a Sino-Soviet Friendship Association.
