Severely Punish Profiteering

The Beijing Huachang Military Uniform Bureau, Quanxing Grain Store, and Yu＠ Grain Store have been accused by the Industry and Commerce Bureau to the People's Court in accordance with the law for illegal activities such as hoarding and speculation, obtaining grain through illegal purchases, and reselling gold and silver.

At the Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference, representatives from all sectors unanimously advocated severe sanctions against unscrupulous merchants who hoard and speculate, disrupting prices and finances. The indictment of illegal businesses by the Municipal Industry and Commerce Bureau is precisely the implementation of the resolution of the representatives' conference. It will certainly be warmly supported by the people from all walks of life!

Hoarding and speculation are fundamentally different from the legitimate storage of necessary grain, raw materials, and supplies by factories and stores. Legitimate industrial manufacturers are completely allowed to store necessary grain and raw materials for direct production and to ensure the living supplies of workers, as long as they do not put these stored grain and materials into the market for speculative trading. Only those who hoard grain and materials, not for the purpose of developing production but for speculation and illegal profiteering, are violating the law. Such illegal acts, no matter who commits them, must be subject to people's reporting and government sanctions. Because such behavior directly endangers people's lives, undermines the national economy, and hinders the development of production.

At the same time, we should also distinguish between legitimate buying and selling in the market and illegal reselling. All legitimate commercial transactions enable the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas and regulate production and consumption. This is necessary, and the legitimate profits of such legitimate merchants should be guaranteed. However, buying at low prices and selling at high prices in the same place, even reselling repeatedly in one day, stimulating prices, and thus obtaining excessive profits, must be banned.

The people's government's industrial and commercial policy is based on the principles of developing production, prospering the economy, considering both public and private interests, and benefiting both labor and capital. In order to implement this principle and protect the economic interests of the people, we must not show any leniency towards unscrupulous merchants who engage in illegal speculation, disrupt the market, cause drastic fluctuations in finance and prices, and thus endanger people's lives and undermine the normal development of industry and commerce. We must impose severe sanctions in accordance with the resolution of the Beijing People's Representative Conference. Although some price increases are inevitable during the current transition period, the normal price trend should be a steady rise, not a drastic fluctuation. Experience has proven that every sudden surge in prices is the result of unscrupulous merchants speculating and disrupting the market. Therefore, the broad masses of the people and all legitimate industrialists and businessmen have the responsibility to cooperate with the government in supervising, inspecting, and exposing the illegal activities of unscrupulous merchants.

The indictment of speculative businesses by the Municipal Industry and Commerce Bureau should be considered only the beginning of the implementation of the resolution of the representatives' conference on banning speculation, but we hope that the trend of speculation can be eliminated from the market from now on, and that there will be no more subsequent cases. If the trend of speculation does not stop for a while, then one case must be handled at a time, until there are no more cases to handle.

### 严惩投机倒把

　　严惩投机倒把
    北平华昌军装局、泉兴粮栈、钰＠粮栈，因囤积居奇、套购粮食、倒卖金银等违法行为，已经工商局向人民法院依法提起控诉。
    在北平市各界代表会议上，各界代表一致主张严厉制裁囤积居奇扰乱物价、金融的奸商。此次市工商局对违法商号的控告，正是执行各界代表会议的决议。当然会得到各界人民热烈地拥护！
    囤积居奇投机倒把的行为，和一般正当的工厂商店积存应有的粮食、原料和物资，是有根本区别的。正当的工业厂家为了直接生产所必需，并为保障工人的生活供应而积存必要的粮食和原料，只要不把这些积存的粮食和物资投到市场上去作投机买卖，那是完全可以被容许的。只有那些囤积粮食物资，目的不是为了发展生产而是为了投机倒把，获取非法的超额利润，那才是犯法的，对于这样的犯法行为，不管他什么人，都必须受到人民的检举和政府的制裁。因为这种行为是直接危害人民生活，破坏国民经济和阻碍生产发展的。
    同时，我们还应该区别市场上正当的买卖和非法的倒卖行为。一切正当的商业买卖，使城乡物资得以交流，使生产与消费得以调节，这是必需的，这样的正当商人的合法利润是应该得到保障的。但是，在同一地方，以低价买进，高价卖出，甚至一日之中，循环倒卖，刺激物价，从而获得超额的利润，这是必须予以取缔的。
    人民政府的工商业政策，是以发展生产、繁荣经济、公私兼顾、劳资两利为原则的，为了贯彻这个原则，保障人民经济生活的利益，对于一切非法的投机活动，捣乱市场，引起金融物价的剧烈波动，以致危害人民生活，破坏工商业正常发展的奸商，决不能有丝毫放任，必须按照北平各界代表会的决议，予以严厉制裁。虽然，在目前的过渡时期，物价的某些上涨是不可避免的，但正常的物价趋势应该是平稳的上升，而不应该发生剧烈的波动。经验证明：每次物价的突然暴涨都是由于奸商投机倒把扰乱市场的结果。因此，广大人民与一切正当的工商业者都有责任来配合政府进行监督、检查和揭发奸商的非法活动。
    此次市工商局控告投机倒把的商号，应该认为只是执行各界代表会议关于取缔投机的决议的开始，但我们希望从此投机之风能在市场上消灭下去，而不希望再有继起的案件。如果投机之风一时仍不停止，那就必须来一个办一个，办到无可办而后已。
