　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 14th: TASS reports: The Peace Conference initiated by the Stockholm Branch of the Swedish National Committee for the Defense of Peace was held on the 12th, with the participation of approximately three thousand people. The conference passed a resolution stating: We oppose our country's participation in the North Atlantic Treaty or any other alliance that does not comply with the United Nations Charter. At the same time, we express our anxiety about certain tendencies in our country's political life. After the official leaders of our foreign policy announced that they do not intend to have Sweden join the Atlantic Treaty, representatives of the Swedish military authorities and the Swedish ambassador to Washington made, and continue to make, contrary statements. A large proportion of Swedish newspapers, news agencies, and radio stations are disseminating propaganda that can only mislead the Swedish public. Therefore, advocates of peace must fight for peace. We give all support to the peace movement led by the Swedish National Committee for the Defense of Peace. We declare our solidarity with the people and groups in other countries who are fighting against war.

　　瑞典举行保卫和平大会号召团结反对侵略公约
    【新华社北平十四日电】塔斯社讯：瑞典拥护和平全国委员会斯德哥尔摩分会所发起的保卫和平大会于十二日举行，参加者约三千人。大会通过决议说：我们反对我国参加北大西洋公约或任何其他不符合联合国宪章的联盟。同时，我们对我国政治生活中的某种倾向表示焦虑。在我们外交政策的官方领袖宣布他们不打算使瑞典加入大西洋公约以后，瑞典军事当局的代表和瑞典驻华盛顿大使却作了并继续在作相反的声明。很大一部分瑞典报纸通讯社和广播散布着只能把瑞典公众引入歧途的宣传。因此，和平的拥护者们必须为和平而奋斗。我们予瑞典拥护和平全国委员会所领导的和平运动以一切支持。我们表明我们与其他国家中为反对战争而奋斗的人民和团体团结一致。
