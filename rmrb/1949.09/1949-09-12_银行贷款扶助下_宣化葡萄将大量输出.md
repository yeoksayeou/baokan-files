　　With Bank Loan Assistance,
　  Xuanhua Grapes Will Be Exported in Large Quantities
    [Xuanhua News] Xuanhua grapes, famous in North China, have been on the market for many days. The annual export volume is about three million catties, and there are more than six thousand large and small grape trellises in the city. This spring, the bank provided a loan of 100,000 yuan to help farmers who could not afford to buy trellis poles. Now, most of the grapes are about to ripen. In order to ensure the smooth sale of grapes to benefit production, the bank has loaned 1.85 million yuan to the Yuxing Transportation Company in Nanguan, Xuanhua, in five installments; grape farmer Wei Qifang could not afford to buy baskets, and the bank provided a loan of 50,000 yuan; and a loan of 1.2 million yuan was provided to the supply and marketing cooperatives in the first and second districts of Xuanhua City for grape export. From August 15th to 31st, about 170,000 catties of grapes have been exported. In the future, with the assistance of the bank, a larger quantity will be exported.
