　　Xuanwumen Grain and Goods Depot

　　[This newspaper dispatch] The Xuanwumen Grain and Goods Depot, directly under the Beijing Supply and Marketing Cooperative General Office, has achieved considerable success in organizing the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas. Since its opening on May 10th, the depot has gradually established business relationships with cooperatives in various regions. In August, its own purchasing and sales business further developed, so personnel were sent to neighboring districts to establish business relationships. Purchasing groups have now been established in Zhuozi Mountain, Jinan, Baoding, Shijiazhuang, and Tianjin, promoting the sale of Ping-Lü (Beijing-Lüshun) industrial products and handicrafts to various regions in exchange for food, pig bristles, fur, and other items. Furs are organized for export, and grain is transported to disaster areas for sale or loans. For example, recently, in coordination with the suburban working committee's work on lending wheat seeds, 5,625 bags of flour were used to exchange for 1 million catties of sorghum from the Food Company. Additionally, some were purchased from the market and then transported to the Baoding and Shijiazhuang areas to exchange for high-quality wheat seeds for lending purposes. The original target was to purchase 560,000 catties, but the task has now been exceeded, and the seeds have been sent to various suburban branches for distribution to disaster-stricken farmers.

　　The dynamics of business transformation can be seen in the statistical figures. In August, the depot's business: 768,977 catties of goods entered the depot, a decrease of 1,058,591 catties compared to the previous month; 810,080 catties of goods left the depot, a decrease of 995,017 catties compared to the previous month. However, for the depot's own business, the total amount of goods purchased was 2,116,967 catties, an increase of 1,497,183 catties compared to the previous month; the total amount of goods sold was 1,129,512 catties, an increase of 567,108 catties compared to the previous month. A portion of the goods sold were put into the market, and the majority were supplied to cooperative members. The supply to cooperative members was 844,819 catties, equivalent to 177,651,998 yuan in People's currency. At a rate of 160 yuan per 111,000 catties of millet, a total of 40 cooperatives purchased grain, with an estimated 180,000 members, averaging 6 catties per person. In addition, a portion of the grain was coordinated with the Grain Company to be released into the market to stabilize prices. For example, after the announcement in the September 11th newspaper of the issuance of 500-yuan and 1,000-yuan denominations of People's currency, some unscrupulous merchants spread rumors in an attempt to drive up prices and profit from it. The Grain and Goods Depot decided to release a large quantity of white flour and mixed wheat grains into the market to cooperate with the Grain Company in stabilizing market prices, becoming a powerful assistant to the Grain Company in the Beijing market.

　　To solve the grain processing problem of consumer cooperatives, the Municipal General Office organized more than 30 mills in the spring to form a "Flour Production Cooperative." However, due to the mills' cutting corners and failing to guarantee quality, in addition to calling on cooperatives to establish their own mills or processing facilities, the eight electric mills within the Grain and Goods Depot have been organized to start operations, specializing in processing for various consumer cooperatives. To meet the widespread demands of various cooperatives, it has been decided to install four rice milling machines, specializing in milling sorghum rice. These are expected to be completed in a month and a half, with a daily milling capacity of 8,000 to 10,000 catties. The existing two mills will specialize in milling millet day and night, with a daily output of 6,000 catties.

　　Now that the autumn harvest is approaching, and the peak season for private goods depots is about to arrive, the depot is actively preparing to expand its autumn business and welcome new tasks.

　　宣武门粮货栈
    郑重
    【本报讯】本市供销合作总社直属的宣武门粮货栈，在组织城乡物资交流等工作中，已获相当成绩。该栈自五月十日开业以来，逐渐和各地合作社建立了业务关系。八月份本身的购销吞吐业务有进一步的开展，乃派人到友邻区建立业务关系。现已在卓资山、济南、保定、石门、天津各地设立采购组；把平律工业品和手工艺品推销各地，换回食粮、猪鬃、皮毛等物。毛皮组织出口，粮食运到灾区，出售或贷放。如最近配合郊区工作委员会的贷麦种工作，用面粉五千六百二十五袋换食粮公司高粱一百万斤；又从市场购入一部，然后运到保、石一带，换回品质优良的麦种以供贷放，原定采购五十六万斤，现已超过任务，并送到各郊区分社调剂给受灾农民。
    由统计数字中可看出业务转变的动态。八月份的货栈业务：进栈货物七六八、九七七斤，较上月减少一、○五八、五九一斤，出栈货物八一○、○八○斤，较上月减少九九五、○一七斤。而本身业务，进货总量二、一一六、九六七斤，较上月增加一、四九七、一八三斤，销货总量一、一二九、五一二斤，较上月增加五六七、一○八斤。销货中一部分投入市场，大部分供给了合作社社员。社员供给量八四四、八一九斤，合人民券一七七、六五一、九九八元。按一六○元折合小米一百一十一万斤，买粮的合作社共四十个，社员按十八万人计算，平均每人六斤。另外一部分粮食则配合粮食公司，抛入市场，平抑物价：如九月十一日报纸上公布了将发行五百元一千元两种人民券之后，某些奸商大造谣言，企图哄抬物价，从中牟利，粮货栈便决定拿出大量白面和小麦杂粮到市场出售，协同粮食公司进行平抑市价，成为粮食公司在北平市场上的有力助手。
    为了解决消费合作社的粮食加工问题，市总社在春天曾组织三十余家磨房成立“面粉生产合作社”。但因磨房偷工减料，不能保证质量，现除号召各合作社自己建立磨房或加工外，并把粮货栈内的八盘电磨组织开工，专门给各消费社加工。为了满足各社的普遍要求，已决定按装四个碾米机，专碾高粱米。一个半月后即可竣工，每天可碾八千到一万斤。原有的两盘碾子则专碾小米，日夜加工，也可出到六千斤。
    现秋收已届，私营货栈的旺月即将到来，该栈正在积极准备扩大秋季业务，迎接新的任务。
