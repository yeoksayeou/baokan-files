Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 23rd—The day after the news of the opening of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference reached Wuhan (the 22nd), Wuhan City was still immersed in the carnival of Yangko dances, gongs and drums, and firecrackers all day long. On this day, the radio station continued to broadcast the news of the People's Political Consultative Conference, and every loudspeaker was surrounded by listeners. The propaganda team of the Central China Military and Political University paraded the streets, playing majestic military music. Pan Shi'an, a worker representative who had participated in the Wuhan All-Circles Representative Conference, was also elected by the workers of the Jiang’an Machinery Plant to give street speeches. More than 6,000 dockworkers in the city held a grand celebratory parade. In the afternoon, seventeen schools held a meeting to decide to study the documents related to the CPPCC and prepare for a grand celebration. The news of the opening of the CPPCC has spread to the rural areas of Wuhan’s suburbs today. Farmers everywhere are gathered around listening to elementary school teachers reading the CPPCC news in the Yangtze River Daily. Farmers from time to time issued cheers and applause, especially when they heard the names of farmer representatives.

Also: The directly affiliated organizations such as the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Hubei Provincial People's Government, the Hubei Military Region, and mass organizations such as the workers', farmers', youth, women's, and literary associations, and various schools, jointly established a preparatory committee for celebrating the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference on the afternoon of the 22nd. The preparatory committee decided to hold a grand military-civilian celebration rally on the afternoon of the 25th, hold a torch parade, and decided to combine the celebration activities with the "World Day of Struggle for Peace" on October 2nd, and carry out extensive publicity from now until October 2nd. The Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Hubei Military Region have also instructed local party committees and military sub-districts at all levels throughout the province to launch extensive celebration and publicity activities to make the news known to every household and welcome the birth of the People's Republic of China.

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 23rd—After the news of the unveiling of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference reached Changsha yesterday, people from all walks of life expressed their congratulations on the birth of the People's Republic of China with unusually excited hearts. Xiao Jinguang, commander of the Hunan Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and director of the Changsha Military Control Commission, pointed out in his speech: The opening of the People's Political Consultative Conference is a watershed moment for the 475 million Chinese people to completely break away from their enslaved, oppressed, and humiliated status and embark on the road of independence, democracy, and freedom. He called on the people of Hunan to mobilize all their strength, restore and develop production, support the front-line operations, and quickly achieve a comprehensive victory throughout the country. The employee representatives who were attending the Changsha Employee Representative Conference congratulated each other upon hearing the news of the unveiling of the People's Political Consultative Conference. Zhang Yingde, a representative of the Yuehan Railway employees, said: "Our railway workers must step up their work, restore railway transportation, and support the front lines." Cai Shengshuo, a postal worker representative, said: "Our working class is the leading class in the democratic united front. We must step up production to welcome the new people's democratic regime." Zeng Guangshu, chairman of the preparatory committee of the Changsha Student Union, said: "We students are willing to study revolutionary theory and various knowledge and skills that are beneficial to the people under the banner of Mao Zedong and strive to build the People's Republic of China." Wang Shikai, the former dean of Keqiang College, said: "This meeting is different from the hypocritical and fake public opinion of the Kuomintang reactionaries and their National Assembly. This is the people's representative meeting of a new democratic country." Cao Bowen, a democratic personage who had just returned from the countryside to comfort the troops, heard the news of the opening of the People's Political Consultative Conference. Based on what he had newly witnessed of the People's Liberation Army living a disciplined and happy life under difficult conditions and helping farmers with the autumn harvest without fear of hardship, he confidently said: "I firmly believe that the Communist Party of China will surely succeed in leading the construction of a new China." Liu Yuehou, a democratic personage, said: "I saw the list of CPPCC representatives in the newspaper, which included all aspects. This is truly gathering the essence of the whole country in one hall, and this is truly a democratic style." Yang Zilin, manager of Zhongzhou Cotton Weaving Factory in the industrial sector, said: "I hope that people in our industrial sector will work with the advanced working class under the principle of mutual benefit between labor and capital to develop production, prosper the economy, and build a new Changsha."
