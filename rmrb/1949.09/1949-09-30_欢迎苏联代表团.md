　　Welcome Soviet Delegation
　　At the very moment when the Chinese people are warmly celebrating the birth of their own Central People's Government, another extremely exciting piece of good news arrives, that is, our greatest and closest friends—the Soviet delegation, undeterred by the long journey, have finally arrived in China amidst our longing! We would like to extend our warm welcome to our dear friends.
　　We will never forget the friendship of the Soviet people towards the Chinese people. As early as after the October Revolution, under the guidance of the great revolutionary teacher Lenin, the Soviet Union gave the Chinese people profound internationalist sympathy and assistance. Therefore, Mr. Sun Yat-sen at that time deeply felt that only the Soviet Union was the most reliable friend of the Chinese people and that we should "take Russia as our teacher." Unfortunately, this deep friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people was soon destroyed and insulted by the Chinese counter-revolutionary Chiang Kai-shek. However, the friendship between the Chinese people and the Soviet Union has not been severed for more than 30 years due to the destruction of the counter-revolution. The Soviet Union has always given the Chinese people internationalist concern and assistance. In the most difficult years of the Chinese People's Revolution, only the Soviet Union gave us the greatest spiritual support and encouragement. In particular, the theoretical weapons of Marxism-Leninism and Stalinism have always been extremely important magic weapons for us to overcome difficulties and defeat the enemy. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Soviet Union's spiritual and material support to China, and the Soviet Union's dispatch of troops to Northeast China in 1945, which led to the unconditional surrender of the Japanese invaders and helped the Chinese people to quickly liberate themselves from the iron hooves of the Japanese invaders, are even more gratefully remembered by the entire Chinese people forever. Today, the old China has perished; the new China has been born. Any obstacles to the friendly cooperation between the Chinese and Soviet people have been fundamentally eliminated. What lies before us is the brilliant future of the extensive and close friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people with unlimited development.
　　It is under such circumstances that the Soviet delegation has come to China, and the Chinese people can stand up unprecedentedly to welcome our greatest friends—the Soviet delegation.
　　This Soviet delegation includes the most outstanding cultural, educational, and artistic figures of the Soviet Union, headed by Alexander Fadeyev, the giant of Soviet socialist literature. Their works, such as those by Fadeyev and Simonov, have been translated into Chinese and have a wide readership in China. These great works have deeply touched people's hearts, inspired the Chinese people's fighting spirit, and enlightened us with the direction of the battle. Today, we feel infinitely honored to welcome our "dear relatives," our great international comrades-in-arms. We dare to declare that the Chinese people must work together with our international comrades-in-arms to defend human culture, defend lasting world peace, and wage a merciless fight against the imperialist warmongers, thoroughly expose all their conspiracies, wound them all over, and make them unrecognizable, and make our Chinese people, following the great Soviet people, appear in the world with a high level of culture.

　　欢迎苏联代表团
    正值中国人民热烈庆祝自己的中央人民政府诞生的时候，又传来一个令人极为兴奋的喜讯，这就是我们最伟大最亲密的朋友——苏联代表团不辞远道跋涉，终于在我们的渴望中莅临中国了！我们谨以满怀热诚欢迎我们亲爱的友人。
    我们永远不会忘记苏联人民对中国人民的友谊。苏联远自十月革命后，即在伟大革命导师列宁的指导下，给予了中国人民以国际主义的深厚的同情和援助，因此，使当时的孙中山先生，也深深地感到：只有苏联是中国人民最可靠的朋友，应“以俄为师”。不幸的是，当时中苏人民这一深笃的友谊，不久便被中国的反革命蒋介石所破坏和污辱了，然而，中国人民与苏联的友谊三十余年来并不因反革命的破坏而断绝，苏联更无时无刻不寄予中国人民以国际主义的关切和援助。在中国人民革命最困难的岁月里，只有苏联给予我们以精神上的最大支援与鼓励，特别是马列主义和斯大林的理论武器，随时成为我们战胜困难，战胜敌人的极重要的法宝。抗战速时期苏联对中国精神上、物质上的支援和一九四五年苏联出兵东北使日寇无条件投降，帮助中国人民迅从日寇铁蹄下获得解放，这更是全中国人民永远感激的。今天旧中国已经灭亡；新中国已经诞生，中苏人民友谊合作的任何障碍都已被根本扫除，展现在我们面前的是中苏人民广泛的亲密友谊无限发展的光辉前途。
    就是在这种情况下，苏联代表团才莅临了中国，中国人民也才能够空前地挺起胸膛来欢迎我们最伟大的友人——苏联代表团。
    此次苏联代表团，包括着以苏维埃社会主义文学的泰斗——亚历山大·法捷耶夫为首的苏联最优秀的文化教育艺术家，他们，如法捷耶夫、西蒙诺夫的作品，都曾被译为中文，在中国曾拥有广大的读者，这些伟大的作品，深入人心，鼓舞了中国人民的斗志，启示我们以战斗的方向。今天，我们迎接我们“心上的亲人”、我们伟大的国际战友来临，感到无上的光荣。我们敢于宣告，中国人民一定要和我们的国际战友共同努力，为保卫人类的文化、保卫世界持久的和平，向帝国主义战争贩子们作无情的搏斗，把它们的一切阴谋彻底地戳穿，把它们戳得遍体鳞伤，不成形状，并使我中国人民，随着伟大的苏联人民之后，以高度的文化出现于世界。
