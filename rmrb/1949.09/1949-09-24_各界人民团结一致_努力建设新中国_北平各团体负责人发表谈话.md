    萧明说：中国人民政治协商会议是中国人民的革命大团结。我们北平工人要在毛主席的旗帜下，在即将成立的中华人民共和国中央政府的领导下，一年左右，将我们三十余万人的队伍基本上组织起来，努力生产，改良技术，爱护机器，节省工料，肃清反革命分子，提高觉悟，勇敢勤劳，学习苏联建国的经验，战胜一切困难，建设新中国。
    北平市民主妇联筹委会负责人说：北平妇女对于人民政协召开和中华人民共和国成立的欢乐兴奋之情，是无法形容的，因为中国妇女数千年来所受的压迫和痛苦，将随同旧的中国永远的一去不复返了。在欢欣鼓舞之余，我们北平妇女将和全北平、全中国人民一道，在中华人民共和国中央政府的领导下，教育我们自己和我们的子孙们，以主人翁的姿态，勇敢而勤劳地工作着，为全中国、全世界人民的美好的将来而不倦地奋斗。

    古奇踪说：青年是热爱自己祖国的。现在中国已经属于人民自己了，北平青年学生将要更加努力地学习，把自己培养成为人民新中国建设中的有用人才。
    薛成业说：我们教育工作者更要加紧学习，改造思想，把自己锻炼成为新中国建设工作中的战士。同时要努力教育青少年一代，使之成为新中国的建设人才。
    傅华亭说：从代表名单中，我们看出会议的代表，正是全中国人民的代表，是从各阶层、各单位、各地区中所产生出来的，这个会议称得起真正人民自己做主的人民政协。中国人民革命在中国共产党领导下胜利了，中国人民从此站立起来了，全世界和平阵营也更坚强了，人民民主的前途光明是无比的。（王向辰谈话，见昨日本报）
