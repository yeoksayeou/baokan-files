　　North China Highway Conference Second Day
  　Zhang Wen'ang Reports on Business Direction
    [Our Newspaper's Report] The North China Highway Transportation Bureau's Manager and Accounting Joint Conference entered its second day on the 17th. Zhang Wen'ang, Deputy Minister of the North China People's Government's Ministry of Transportation, went to give a speech. He first analyzed the current situation, emphasizing self-reliance, and relying on and learning from the Soviet Union. He pointed out six problems that need improvement in business: (1) Resolutely develop charcoal-fueled vehicles. Gasoline vehicles that waste fuel and those that are past their prime need to be converted. Better gasoline vehicles still need to be preserved. (2) In management and operation, it is necessary to overcome the tendency of departmentalism and capitalist viewpoints, and learn socialist management and operation methods. (3) Connect, organize and support the development of mass transportation, and under the leadership of state-owned transportation enterprises, jointly complete the transportation tasks for the exchange of urban and rural goods. (4) Reduce transportation costs. Increase the number of personnel directly participating in production and reduce the number of administrative management personnel in order to develop production and improve people's lives. (5) All work should be planned, developed, and completed around transportation work. (6) All tasks must rely on the working class and the masses to be completed. Improve management methods and implement democratic management.
