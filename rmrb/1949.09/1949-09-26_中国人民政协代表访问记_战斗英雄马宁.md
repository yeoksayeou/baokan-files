　　Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Representatives Visit
  　Combat Hero Ma Ning
    Chen Ji
    Ma Ning, a combat hero of the Second Field Army, walks with a slight limp. His strong legs have been hit by bullets several times. One time was in the Dabie Mountains, where he was the deputy commander of a regiment, leading his troops through the rugged mountains, about forty meters away from the enemy. A bullet entered his left leg from the rear of his thigh. He fell down the mountain, got up, and was supported by his orderly, escaping the enemy. His tenacious body, without a hospital or rear support in the Dabie Mountains, was hidden in a cave to recover from his injuries. When the enemy came to "mop up," he endured the pain and walked again with his injury, falling once more on the mountain road. He leaned on a table board to prevent his leg from being ruined. After receiving medical treatment, even though his left leg was one finger shorter, he still worked vigorously in the army.
    Talking about his injuries, he said that during the fourteen months after the start of the War of Liberation in 1946, he was wounded four times. In the Battle of Yutai, he was only a mile away from the enemy when a bullet grazed his leg. He continued to command the soldiers when a sniper shot him in the stomach. The bullet didn't come out and pierced fifteen holes in his intestines. He wasn't afraid of the pain. He didn't eat anything for twenty-five consecutive days, only drinking water, and allowed the doctor to perform surgery. His intestines were completely taken out, and after the fifteen holes were sewn up, he joined the battle in the Dabie Mountains in less than four months. Although his stomach often hurt in the damp weather, he still fought actively. Speaking of this, he gratefully said, "I really have to thank our Minister of Health, Zhan Shaolian, and other medical staff for my stomach being okay."
    Comrade Ma Ning's home is in Qinyang County, Henan Province. He grew up in a middle-peasant family, ploughing and tilling the land. Later, he studied for a few years, becoming a member of the Communist Youth League in senior primary school. His older brother was a Communist Party member. When the War of Resistance against Japan broke out, he left home secretly, against his mother's wishes, through his brother's introduction, and joined the people's revolutionary war at the age of sixteen. In the army, he served as the head of the civil affairs section, the chief of the combat staff, and the chief of staff of the regiment. In 1938, he became a glorious Communist Party member. Under the Party's cultivation, he was not only brave and fierce, flexible and mobile, but also able to endure hardship. Not sleeping for three days and three nights and not eating for two or three days had become a habit for him.
    In the great war of the Jiluyu region emerging from the Longhai Railway three times, he was an excellent commander, although he repeatedly humbly said: "I am ashamed to be a combat hero. The things I did were very ordinary, nothing to talk about." In this magnificent People's Liberation War, there were too many tragic events to write or say clearly. But when I asked him about a famous battle he personally commanded, he smiled for a while and slowly said that in August 1946, they attacked Lanfeng, and his entire regiment was tasked with capturing the station south of Lanfeng. After receiving the task, they were determined to "fight a brilliant victory." Ma Ning was the regiment's chief of staff at the time, and he led his troops at the forefront, rushing through fifty or sixty li of enemy-occupied territory and crossing the railway. When they were about to capture the station ticket office, they found that the trains near the station were loaded with enemy tanks, and there were also forty or so bunkers near the station, which they had not anticipated. They attacked the ticket office several times without success. Comrade Ma Ning responded decisively and came up with the idea of immediately occupying the largest bunker, concentrating their forces, and soon occupying the bunker. From their high vantage point, they threw grenades, hitting a train full of enemy shells. The enemy tanks arrogantly drove out, and they used captured enemy anti-tank rounds to shoot, finally hitting two tanks. At that time, the remaining enemies in Lanfeng City fled to the station, and they blocked the fleeing enemies near the station. They then launched an attack from the southwest on two roads, capturing more than four hundred enemies alive, and all eleven tanks were captured, which was the first time in their history that they had captured tanks. In this battle, they attacked from the southwest on two sides, and only ambushed a battalion of men on the east side, without encircling the enemy, and then annihilated them when they fled from the east. This combat method was praised by the superiors, and Comrade Ma Ning was promoted to deputy commander.
    In the breakout battle of Funcun in Yanling, the troops commanded by Comrade Ma Ning, even the wooden parts on the rifles were burning, and they were out of ammunition, but they remained incomparably calm; only after seizing the enemy's bullets did they continue to fight and successfully break through.
    In the defensive battle of Dazhangji, the enemy attacked Ma Ning's regiment of men with four regiments of troops. Their regiment mobilized all the grooms and cooks to fight the enemy, exhausting them, and they didn't even know how many troops they had. Comrade Ma Ning said that this battle attracted the enemy to their vicinity, which played a significant role in eliminating Zhao Xitian of the enemy's Third Division.
    Having experienced countless battles, Comrade Ma Ning, tempered in the flames of war, came to the people's capital as a representative of the Second Field Army to participate in the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. He resolutely said: "The People's Liberation Army must use its brave and skillful fighting strength to completely eliminate the Kuomintang reactionaries, study hard, and defend the motherland's national defense. We are not afraid of any imperialist conspiracy. Chairman Mao said at the first session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference that the Chinese people have stood up from now on. Yes, the Chinese people have stood up from now on. We are extremely excited. We will never fear difficulties. We will certainly establish a glorious, brilliant, democratic, free, prosperous, and happy New China under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao."

　　中国人民政协代表访问记
  　战斗英雄马宁
    陈迹
    第二野战军的战斗英雄马宁，走起路来，有点儿拐，在他强壮的腿上，曾被子弹打中过几次。有一次是在大别山，他是某团的副团长，带领着部队，活动在崎岖的山头，离敌人四十公尺的地方，一颗子弹由后股穿出左腿，他跌倒在山下，爬起来，由靠着他的通信员扶持，躲开了敌人。他的顽强身体，在没有医院，没有后方的大别山附近，隐藏在山洞里养伤，敌人又来“清剿”，他忍痛的带着伤又走，在山路上又跌断了一次，他靠着桌板子，没有把腿弄坏。医疗好了之后，即使左腿短了一个指头，他还是很矫健的在部队里工作。
    谈起了他负伤的情形，他说，三十五年解放战争开始，在十四个月当中，他负了四次伤。在鱼台的战斗中，他离敌人只有一里路，子弹穿擦了他的腿部，他还指挥着战士，不料一个冷枪，打中了他的肚子，子弹没有出来，肠子打穿了十五个洞，他也不怕痛，一连二十五天没吃东西，光是喝水，任凭大夫动手术，他的肠子曾全部拿了出来，十五个洞缝了之后，不到四个月的功夫，他又参加了大别山的战斗。虽然在阴湿的天气，肚儿常常疼痛，他还是活跃地战斗着。说到这里，他很感激地说，“我的肚子能够好，真真要感谢我们的卫生部长詹少联和其他医务工作同志。”
    马宁同志，家在河南沁阳县，从小在一个中农的家庭，耕地翻土；后来读了几年书，在高小就做了共产主义青年团团员，他哥是个共产党员。抗战爆发了，他由他哥的介绍，不顾母亲的不同意，偷偷的离开了家，十六岁参加了人民革命战争。在部队里，他当过民运科长，作战参谋股长，团参谋长。一九三八年，他成为一个光荣的共产党员。在党的培养下，不仅英勇凶猛，灵活机动；而且能吃苦耐劳，三天三晚不睡觉，两天三天不吃饭，在他看来，已成了习惯。
    在冀鲁豫三出陇海路的伟大战争中，他是一个优良的指挥员，虽然他一再谦虚：“我当了战斗英雄，惭愧得很，事情很平凡，没什么可说的。”在这轰轰烈烈的人民解放战争中，悲壮的事儿太多了，写不完，说不清。但当我问到他亲自指挥的有名的战斗时，他笑了一会，慢慢的说道，三十五年八月，他们进攻兰封，他们全团担任攻占兰封以南的车站。接受了任务后，他们都下了“坚决打个出色的胜仗”的决心。马宁当时是团参谋长，他带领着部队走在最前头，冲过了五六十里的敌占区，越过了铁路。当他们要攻占车站票房时，谁知道车站附近的火车上装载了敌人的坦克，车站附近还有四十来个碉堡，这是他们预先所没料想到的。他们向票房冲击了几次没成功，马宁同志临机应变，想出了马上占领最大碉堡的办法，集中了兵力，不一会，就占据了碉堡。他们居高临下的掷手榴弹，打中敌人满载炮弹的一列车。敌人坦克逞凶，毫不在乎地开了出来，他们以收缴敌人的反坦克弹射击，终于打中了两辆坦克，那时兰封城的残余敌人向车站逃窜，他们于是堵击残敌窜近了车站。他们遂由西南两路，发动攻击，生俘敌人四百余，全部十一辆坦克尽被卤获，这是他们有史以来第一次获得了坦克。这个战斗，他们从西南两面攻击，在东面只埋伏了一营人，没有围击敌人，等敌人从东面逃跑时，方尽情消灭之。这种战斗方式，得到了上级的奖誉，马宁同志荣升了副团长。
    在鄢陵府村的突围战中，马宁同志指挥的部队，连步枪上的木块都烧着了，弹药打尽了，还保持着无比的镇静；等到把敌人的子弹夺了回来，才又战斗下去，胜利突围。
    大张集的防御战，敌人以四个团兵力攻犯马宁指挥的一团人。他们的团发动了所有马夫。伙夫，跟敌人干，把敌人弄得筋疲力尽，还不知道他们有多少兵力。马宁同志说，这次战斗把敌人吸引在自己周围，对于消灭敌人整三师赵锡田起了很大作用。
    经历了无数次战斗，在战争烈火中锻炼出来的马宁同志，代表第二野战军来到人民首都参加中国人民政协，他坚决的说：“人民解放军要以其英勇善战的雄壮力量，彻底消灭国民党反动派，努力学习，保卫祖国的国防。任何帝国主义的阴谋，我们决不害怕。毛主席在人民政协第一届会议上说，中国人从此站立起来了，是的，中国人从此站立起来了，我们兴奋极了，我们决不畏惧困难，我们一定在共产党和毛主席的领导下，建立一个辉煌灿烂的民主、自由、富强、康乐的新中国。”
