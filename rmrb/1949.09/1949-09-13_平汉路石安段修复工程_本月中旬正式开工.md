Pinghan Railway Shijiazhuang-Anyang Section Restoration Project
	Officially Commences in Mid-September

    [This Newspaper Report] The restoration project for the Shijiazhuang-Anyang section of the Pinghan Railway will officially commence in mid-September. The Fourth Detachment of the Railway Engineering Corps previously organized a reconnaissance team to conduct on-site investigations of the damage to the line and bridges in that section. They are currently studying and formulating a construction plan. The damage to the Shijiazhuang-Anyang section is quite severe, with three hundred bridges of various sizes destroyed, totaling 4522.27 meters in length, and twenty-one stations. Among the bridges, the construction of more than twenty large bridges such as the Shahe River, Zhanghe River, and ＠ River bridges is relatively extensive. The Shahe River Bridge (a total of four) is 310 meters long with thirty spans. The Zhanghe River Bridge is the largest bridge on the Shijiazhuang-Anyang section, with a total length of 420 meters and twenty spans of 20-meter-span upper-bearing steel plate girders.
