Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 22nd: The Propaganda Department of the CCP Central China Bureau issued a notice on the 20th regarding the International Day of Struggle for Peace, calling on all people in Central China and all Party, government, military, and civilian organizations to use their actions on this day to express their determination and strength in opposing new wars of aggression. It also suggested that all large and medium-sized cities in Central China hold demonstrations and parades on October 2nd, provided that production is not affected.

The notice requires all regions, in accordance with the specific situation that most of Central China is newly liberated, to expose the aggressive nature of American imperialists and their running dogs, the Kuomintang reactionaries, and their consistent acts of aggression against the Chinese people, due to the long-term dogmatic and deceptive propaganda of the American imperialists and their running dogs, the Kuomintang reactionaries, which has caused confused thinking among the people in the new areas. It also requires promoting the idea that the Soviet Union is a socialist country with a peaceful and democratic foreign policy, and its revolutionary policy of aiding oppressed nations around the world in their independence and liberation, especially the concrete facts of consistently aiding the Chinese revolution, to prove that the Soviet Union is the most reliable, powerful, and sincere friend of the Chinese people. It must be explained that imperialism is fragile and has various internal contradictions, and that the people's democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union is strong.

The notice said: We hope that on October 2nd, advanced workers, broad revolutionary intellectuals, and all democrats will be mobilized to explain the above-mentioned principles to the people in factories, schools, theaters, streets, and rural areas in the suburbs of cities in a guided and decentralized manner. Therefore, we hope that factories, schools, government agencies, and troops in various regions will systematically study important documents related to world peace, Sino-Soviet relations, and critiques of the US State Department White Paper recently published by the New China News Agency before October 2nd, launch a broad ideological study movement, and establish and develop the work of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association.

[This Newspaper Shanghai Special Telegram] People from all walks of life in Shanghai are actively展开ing activities to welcome the International Day of Struggle for Peace. On the 18th, the preparatory office for the Shanghai "International Day of Struggle for Peace" was established and decided to carry out in-depth publicity and education in various units in advance with the content of defending world peace and promoting internationalism, to organize a World Peace Defense Propaganda Week, and to hold grand commemorative meetings and torchlight parades around October 2nd. The Propaganda Department, Command Department, Democratic Women's Federation, Shanghai Literary Association, Youth League Working Committee, and Higher Education Federation of the preparatory office have all held meetings successively and formulated work plans.
