　　US 480,000 Coal Miners'
  　Strike Enters Second Week
    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 28th: New York dispatch: The strike of 480,000 coal miners which began on the 19th has entered its second week, and as of the 26th, the strikers are still holding on. Last week, picket lines prevented strikebreakers from succeeding in their sabotage attempts in several mining areas near Charleston, West Virginia. Mine owners have been using the police for suppression, and three workers were arrested on "disturbing the peace" charges in western Pennsylvania last weekend.
    According to a United Press report: If the demands of the steel and auto workers are not met, more than 600,000 workers will go on strike this weekend, including 500,000 steel workers and 115,000 Ford Motor Company workers. At the same time, the UE workers at Westinghouse and General Electric are also considering holding a strike vote.

　　美四十八万煤矿工人
  　大罢工进入第二周
    【新华社北京二十八日电】纽约消息：十九日开始的四十八万煤矿工人大罢工已进入第二周，迄二十六日止，罢工人仍在坚持中。上周工人纠察队曾使罢工破坏者在西弗吉尼亚州查利斯顿附近若干矿区中的破坏行为未能实现。矿主们已在利用警察进行镇压，上周周末在宾州西部借“骚动罪”名逮捕了三个工人。
    据合众社消息：如钢铁与汽车工人的要求不能满足，则本周周末将续有六十余万工人举行罢工，计钢铁工人五十万，福特汽车公司工人十一万五千人。同时，威斯汀豪斯及奇异两电器公司的产联电器工人，也正在考虑举行罢工投票。
