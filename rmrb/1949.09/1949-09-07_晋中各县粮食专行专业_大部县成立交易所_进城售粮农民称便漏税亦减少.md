　　Jinzhong Various Counties Implement Grain Monopoly and Specialization
  　Most Counties Establish Exchanges
    Farmers Selling Grain in Cities Find it Convenient, and Tax Evasion is Reduced
    [Taiyuan Electric] Jinzhong various counties have implemented grain monopoly and specialization, and most counties have also established grain exchanges to strengthen grain management. After the original Taiyuan Area Urban Work Conference in April, Jinzhong counties successively implemented grain monopoly and specialization in May and June, and established grain exchanges. In terms of grain monopoly and specialization, it was generally ensured that non-grain businesses were not allowed to engage in the grain trade, and processing and semi-processing industries were only allowed to buy and sell for manufacturing purposes and were prohibited from selling. On the one hand, administrative power was used for management, and business licenses were issued; at the same time, the masses were mobilized for management. This prevented unscrupulous merchants, who had always regarded grain as a target for speculation, from taking advantage of loopholes, protected the interests of legitimate merchants, and played a significant role in stabilizing prices. After the establishment of the grain exchanges, daily listings for transactions and agency sales and purchases were provided, which was convenient for merchants and residents. For example, since the opening of the Fenyang Exchange, due to good management, grain from various places has been traded at the exchange. Farmers feel that the daily listing and trading at the exchange prevents them from being deceived due to a lack of understanding of market conditions, thus avoiding "squeeze" losses. Buyers are also satisfied because they feel that the prices are fair and the quantities are accurate. In the past, private grain stores would lower prices as soon as there was an abundance of grain on the market, forcing farmers from afar to sell their grain cheaply. This phenomenon no longer exists. Whenever there is too much grain to sell, the trading company will conduct purchases. If farmers are unwilling to sell, the exchange will also provide storage services. At the same time, planned storage and release of grain is carried out through the exchange, which is very helpful in stabilizing prices. According to reports, exchanges in various counties have purchased large quantities of grain on behalf of trading companies. In terms of taxation, due to the concentration of transactions, the phenomenon of tax evasion has gradually decreased. After the establishment of the Jiexiu Grain Exchange in May, tax revenue increased by one fold compared to April.
    Bureaucratic Work Style in Exchanges Must Be Overcome Immediately
    However, due to the lack of experience in the initial operation of the exchanges, the exchanges in some counties still have serious shortcomings. First of all, the bureaucratization and bureaucratic style of some county grain exchanges must be overcome. For example, in counties such as Yuci, mechanical office systems and complicated procedures were stipulated, which made it extremely inconvenient for farmers selling grain and made them unwilling to go to the exchanges. Although it has been corrected, attention is still needed. Furthermore, there are two biases in the exchange's business. One is that exchanges with more tax cadres pay special attention to tax collection, but do not pay enough attention to businesses such as introducing transactions and agency sales and purchases (such as the Qixian Exchange); the other is that exchanges with more trade cadres pay special attention to collecting grain on behalf of trading companies, and all the grain arriving at the exchange is purchased by the trading company, which increases the trouble for the general public to buy grain (such as Yuci and Taigu). Various counties have also not paid enough attention to the education of traders, and there are also individual cases of embezzlement and fraud.
    Comprehensive Consideration Must Be Given to Fully Implement Free Internal Trade
    Finally, in terms of grain management, the North China Government has long instructed that all permits and quantity limits should be abolished, but until now, some areas have not seriously implemented this. Some cadres regard their own county as an "independent country," believing that grain leaving the county is an "export." Regardless of whether large cities need grain, they attempt to stabilize prices by restricting grain from leaving the county. In Jiexiu County, buying grain still requires a "certificate" and approval procedures, and each person can buy no more than 150 jin of grain. This violates the principle of free internal trade.

### 晋中各县粮食专行专业　大部县成立交易所  进城售粮农民称便漏税亦减少

　　晋中各县粮食专行专业
  　大部县成立交易所
    进城售粮农民称便漏税亦减少
    【太原电】晋中各县粮食实行了专行专业，大部县并成立起粮食交易所，加强了粮食管理。今年四月，原太原区城市工作会议后，晋中各县在五、六月间相继实行了粮食专行专业，成立起粮食交易所。在粮食专行专业上，一般作到了非粮食业不准经营粮食，加工与半加工业亦只准收卖进行制造禁止贩卖。一面以行政力量进行管理，颁发了营业证；同时发动群众进行管理，这样就使一向以粮食为投机对象的奸商无隙可乘，保障了正当商人的利益，对稳定物价上起了很大作用。粮食交易所成立后，每日挂牌交易，代客买卖，便利商民。如汾阳交易所自开业后，由于经营的好，各地粮食均到交易所成交。农民感到交易所每日挂牌买卖，即不会象过去因不了解行情而受骗，遭受“撒合”的损失。买客感到价格公道分量公平，亦很满意。过去私人粮店一见市上粮多便压价，使远道而来的农民不得不贱价卖粮。现在此种现象已不存在。每当粮多卖不完时，贸易公司便进行收购，农民不愿卖时，交易所还代为保存。同时通过交易所进行有计划吞吐粮食，对平稳物价很有作用。据报告各县交易所均为贸易公司代买了大批粮食。在税收上由于交易集中，漏税现象，逐渐减少。介休五月份粮食交易所成立后，比四月份税收即增加了一倍。
    交易所存在官僚作风必须立即克服
    但因交易所初办缺乏经验，目前有些县交易所尚存在严重缺点。首先是有些县粮食交易所的机关化与官僚主义必须克服，如榆次等县，曾规定了机械的办公制度，再加一套繁杂的手续，使得售粮农民极感不便，不愿到交易所去。现虽经纠正尚须注意。再者在交易所业务上存有两种偏向，一种是税收干部多的交易所，对收税特别注意，而对介绍成交、代客买卖等业务则注意不够（如祁县交易所）；一种是贸易干部多的交易所，特别注重代贸易公司收粮，所有到交易所之粮全由贸易公司收购，以致使得一般群众买粮反而增加麻烦（如榆次、太谷）。各县对交易员的教育亦注意不够，还有个别营私舞弊现象。
    必须照顾全面贯彻内地贸易自由
    最后在粮食管理上，一切凭证限量，华北政府早已指示全部取消，但是直到现在，某些地区尚没认真执行。有些干部把本县看成“独立国”，认至粮食出县便是“出口”，不管大城市是否需要粮食，想以限制粮食出县来平稳物价。介休县至今买粮还要“证明”，并要经过批准手续，每人买粮最多不能超过一百五十斤。这是与内地贸易自由的原则相违背的。
