　　New Exhibition Halls Opened in the Palace Museum
  　Sharp Contrast Between the Lives of Emperors and Peasants

　　[This newspaper's dispatch] The Beiping Palace Museum, under the Cultural Relics Department of the Higher Education Commission, recently completed the arrangement of four thematic exhibitions: "Historical Materials Exhibition of the Life of Emperors and Empresses of the Qing Dynasty," "Forbidden Books Exhibition," "Textile Exhibition," and "Jade Exhibition." The museum also hosted a preview reception and seminar for cultural relics workers in Beiping at the Boxin Hall of the Palace Museum at 2:00 PM on the 4th. Ma Heng, Director of the Palace Museum, and Wang Yeqiu, Director of the Cultural Relics Department of the Higher Education Commission, reported on the preparation process. Guests including Zheng Zhenduo, Fan Wenlan, Deng Chumin, Pei Wenzhong, Xu Beihong, Li Helin, Han Shouxuan, and Wang Zhongmin, totaling more than 30 people, were then guided to visit the exhibitions separately. It is noted that the historical materials and clothing items of the Qing Dynasty emperors and empresses displayed in this exhibition are presented in contrast with the daily necessities of peasants. This sharp contrast between the lives of the ruling class and the ruled allows visitors to gain a deeper impression. In addition, the exhibition of forbidden books exposes the autocracy of the feudal emperors, while the displays of textiles and jadeware highlight the exquisite craftsmanship of our working people.

　　故宫新辟陈列室
  　尖锐对比帝王农民生活
    【本报讯】高等教育委员会文物处所属北平故宫博物院，最近着手布置的“满清帝后生活史料陈列室”、“禁书陈列室”、“纺织品陈列室”、“玉器陈列室”等四个专题展览，已全部布置完毕，该院并于四日下午二时招待在平文物工作者在故宫博心殿举行招待预展座谈会，由故宫博物院院长马衡、高等教育委员会文物处处长王冶秋报告筹备经过后，来宾郑振铎、范文澜、邓初民、裴文中、徐悲鸿、李何林、韩寿萱、王重民等三十余人即被引导分别参观。按此次展览中所陈列满清帝后生活史料及享用服饰是与农民生活用品对比陈设起来的，把统治阶级的生活与被统治阶级的生活作了尖锐的对比，使观众可以得到更深刻的印象。另外禁书及纺织品、玉器的陈设，或则揭穿了封建帝王的专横，或则阐扬我国劳动人民手工艺的精工。
