　　Promoting Ping-Zhang Trade
  　Ping Industrial Delegation Inspects Zhang City's Economy, Discusses Production and Sales Contracts to Reduce Consumer Burden
    [Our Dispatch] The Beiping Industrial Delegation, shouldering the mission of promoting material exchange, arrived in Zhangjiakou from Beiping on August 24th. After nine days of investigation, research, and visits, and after several discussions and exchanges of views with responsible persons from the Chahar Province and Zhang City industrial and commercial departments, as well as local industrialists and businessmen, a preliminary foundation has been laid for future material exchange between the two regions. In the exchange of production and sales experiences, shortcomings and blind spots in production were mutually reviewed, and the direction and division of labor in industrial production in the two regions were clarified.
    The industry of Chahar Province is relatively backward, and most industrial products need to be supplied from other places, thus becoming a sales market for Beiping industrial products. Beiping's serge, cloth, herringbone twill, lining cloth, blue and blue city cloth, and imitation Shanghai-made sub-grade towels, coarse woolen socks, and durable cotton textiles occupy a large market in Chahar Province. Enamelware, better quality soaps, and general daily necessities also have considerable sales. However, a single item, from the Beiping factory to the Zhang City store, and then to the consumer, has to go through two or even three transfers by vendors and merchants, which increases the price and affects sales considerably. After discussions and research between the Beiping Industrial Delegation and the Zhang City Chamber of Commerce and responsible persons from some trade associations, it was unanimously agreed that reducing the number of transfers and lowering the selling price is equivalent to indirectly increasing the people's purchasing power, which is indeed a key to promoting industrial products. Therefore, both parties proposed the idea of combining industry and commerce, and directly linking production and sales, by having relevant industrial and commercial enterprises in the two regions sign collective production and sales contracts. For example, the enamel bowls from the Beiping Sanzhong Enamel Factory, if not transferred through intermediate merchants and directly from the Beiping factory to the Zhang City department store, could be 20% to 30% cheaper than the current market price in Zhang City. Although the method of signing collective contracts has not been fully concretized, it has at least embarked on this path, laying the foundation for the restoration of normal trade between Beiping and Zhang, and promoting material exchange.
    Chahar North and Inner Mongolia produce fur, which are the main raw material sources for Beiping's leather making, wool spinning, and carpet industries. The Chahar Province Trading Company is purchasing large quantities in Inner Mongolia. However, the leather and wool from the Northwest have always been of inferior quality. After understanding the livestock situation in Chahar North in Zhang City, the delegation has put forward improvement suggestions to the Chahar Province administrative departments: for cattle raising, feed should be given in the absence of green grass season, and attention should be paid to nutrition. The cattle pens should be kept clean, and beating should be avoided as much as possible, and do not brand the upper leg. Pay attention not to cut the cowhide when peeling. Spring wool, autumn wool, cased wool and other should be separated clearly, do not mix. When the trading company purchases fur, it should be priced according to the quality.
    After understanding the economic overview of Chahar Province and visiting thirteen public and private factories, the delegation believes that Zhangjiakou has unlimited prospects for industrial development, and some members have considered investing in building factories in Zhang. The richness of electricity and fuel in Xiahuayuan, the abundance of coal in Datong, wheat, millet, and sesame in Chahar North, and the abundance of industrial raw materials such as fur, cattle and sheep bones, mirabilite, ephedra, and crude alkali are all favorable conditions. If new oil extraction plants (extracting sesame oil), flour mills, bone glue factories, and leather factories are set up, all are suitable. At a time when the government is calling for factories to move inland, and some factories that are not suitable for the current needs are preparing to switch industries, Zhangjiakou will become an object of factory establishment, which can further accelerate the industrial development of Zhang City. The machine tools, flour milling machines, oil presses, and wool spinning machines made by Beiping's machinery industry will also have a larger market.
    [Further News] The Beiping Industrial Delegation left Zhangjiakou for Datong on the 2nd to conduct an inspection. It is expected to return to Beiping before the 10th of this month.

　　增进平张贸易
  　平工业参观团考察张市经济状况商拟产销合同以减轻消费者负担
    【本报讯】肩负促进物资交流使命的北平工业参观团八月二十四日由平抵达张家口后，经九天的调查、研究、参观，并与察省及张市工商部门负责人及当地工商业家数度座谈交换意见后，已初步奠定平张两地今后物资交流的基础。在交换产销经验中，又互相检讨了缺点及生产上的盲目现象，并明确了两地工业生产的方向及分工。
    察省工业比较落后，工业品大部需外地供给，因此成为北平工业品的推销地。平市的线呢、条布、人字呢、里予布、青蓝市布及仿上海制品的副号毛巾，粗线袜予以及耐用的棉织品，在察省占有大的市场。搪瓷用品，品质较好的肥皂及一般日用品，也都有相当销路。但一件物品由北平的工厂到张市的商店，再到消费者手里，中间要经过摊贩、行商等两层乃至三层转手，价格因之提高，销路颇受影响。经过北平工业参观团和张市商会及部分同业公会负责人座谈研究，一致认为减少转手层次，降低售价，即等于间接提高人民购买力，确为推销工业品之一主要关键。因之双方提出了工业与商业结合，产与销直接联系的意见，以两地有关的工业与商业订立产、销集体合同办法。例如北平三中搪瓷厂的搪瓷碗，如不经过中间行商转手，由北平工厂直接到张市百货店，比现在张市市面的售价可以便宜百分之二十到百分之三十。虽然订集体合同的办法尚未完全具体化，但至少已走上这条道路，而奠定了平张两地恢复正常贸易，促进物资交流之基础。
    察北及内蒙出产皮毛，为北平的制革业、纺毛业、地毯业主要原料来源地。察省贸易公司正大量在内蒙收购。但西北的皮革、羊毛一向品质低劣。参观团在张市了解了察北的牧畜情况后，已向察省行政方面提出改善意见：对于养牛，在无青草季节应喂以饲料，注意营养。牛圈内要保持清洁，尽可能不用鞭打，不要在股肱上烫记。剥皮时要注意勿刀伤牛皮。羊毛不要掺土。春毛、秋毛、套毛等应分别清楚，不要混杂。贸易公司在收购皮毛时，要按品质好坏计价。
    参观团在了解察省经济概况及参观十三个公私营工厂之后，认为张家口在发展工业上有无限前途，某些团员已考虑在张投资建厂问题。下花园的电力和燃料，大同的大炭，察北小麦，小米、胡麻等农产物之丰富，皮毛、牛羊骨、芒硝、麻黄、土碱等工业原料之充足，都是有利的条件。如果设置新式的榨油厂（榨胡麻油）、面粉厂、骨胶厂、制革厂等无不适合。当此政府号召工厂内迁，及若干不适合目前需要之工厂准备转业之际，张家口将成为一设厂之对象，更可加速张市工业之发展。北平的机器业所制之机器母机、磨面机、榨油机、纺毛机等亦将随之有了更大的销路。
    【又讯】北平工业参观团于二日由张家口赴大同考察，预计本月十日前可返平。
