[This Municipality News] The Preparatory Committee of the Beiping Municipal Federation of Trade Unions convened an enlarged cadre meeting on the 30th and 31st of last month for cadres from the district offices of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, trade unions of various enterprises and factories, and industry trade unions to relay the spirit of the National Trade Union Work Conference. Cadres from relevant organs such as the Ministry of Railways, the Finance Committee, the Municipal Party Committee, the Enterprise Department, the Pingjin Railway Bureau, the Suburban Committee, the Youth League Committee, the Labor Bureau, the Enterprise Bureau, the Industry and Commerce Bureau, the Women's Federation, the Production and Marketing Cooperative, and the Construction Office were also invited to participate, with a total of over 800 people attending. On the 30th, Xiao Ming, director of the Preparatory Committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, gave a report on the issue of trade union organization from the National Trade Union Work Conference. He first explained that this National Trade Union Work Conference was extremely important and that the CCP Central Committee attached great importance to it. Chairman Mao himself attended the conference and gave cordial instructions to all the representatives, Commander-in-Chief Zhu twice attended the meeting to speak, and Vice-Chairman Zhou attended the meeting to give a political report. According to Comrade Liu Shaoqi's instructions to basically organize the national working class in about a year, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions clearly stipulated that the main task of trade union work is to organize workers and establish trade unions. Then, he gave a detailed report on the issues of names, members, membership fees, democratic life, organizational system, tasks, staffing, funding, and relations with various parties in trade union organizations at the conference. He summarized the issues related to trade union organization into the following points: Regarding the trade unions themselves, it is necessary to extensively establish trade unions, develop membership, and oppose closed-doorism and formalism in trade union work; carry out democratic life, truly implement the democratic system of trade unions, implement democratic elections, change the appointment system, carry out the movement of everyone running trade unions, and correct the practice of monopolizing everything; promote the spirit of unity and mutual assistance of the working class, and do a good job in workers' welfare undertakings. Finally, he called on trade union cadres to follow the direction indicated by Chairman Mao, inherit the hard-working style of the martyrs of the labor movement, and ensure that the working class of Beiping is organized in about a year to complete the glorious task assigned to us by the higher authorities.
    On the second day of the meeting, Comrade Zhang Hongshun first relayed the issue of launching a democratic movement and establishing factory management committees. In addition to relaying Comrade Li Lisan's report, he summarized several experiences of Beiping in establishing factory management committees, pointing out that when establishing management committees, it is necessary to closely integrate them with production to achieve the goals of developing production, reducing costs, and improving product quality; when establishing factory management committees, it is necessary to pass them through the workers' representative assembly to establish the workers' sense of ownership. Responsible cadres in charge of enterprises and factories should conduct self-criticism in conjunction with the development of this democratic movement and truly listen to the opinions of the workers. At the same time, it is necessary to launch a struggle between two lines, oppose bureaucracy and commandism, and also oppose extreme democracy and narrow, purely economic viewpoints. According to the draft resolution of the meeting and the reports of Comrades Li Lisan and Liu Zijiu, Comrade Liu Laifu made a key report on the issue of handling labor-capital relations, explaining the basic situation of current labor-capital relations, the principles and policies for handling labor-capital relations, and why it is necessary to implement the policy of "developing production and benefiting both labor and capital." Workers and trade unions can first use negotiation and consultation to resolve labor-capital disputes. If negotiation and consultation fail, they can ask the Labor Bureau to mediate and arbitrate. If the problem still cannot be resolved, they can finally ask the court to make a judgment. He emphasized that each industry should negotiate and sign collective contracts according to the principle of "one line, one industry." This is the central link in resolving labor-capital disputes in private enterprises. Subsequently, Comrade Ma Guangdou gave a brief explanation of the nature, tasks, organization, labor disputes, resolution steps, and the current thinking and activities of both labor and capital. Finally, Comrade Zhang Chunjiu reported on the experience of the city's Chinese medicine industry in negotiating and signing collective contracts; Comrade Zhang Xiaomei conveyed Comrade Cai Chang's report on the work of female workers.

　　组织全体工人  做好工会工作
  　传达全国工会工作会议精神
  　市总工会扩大干部会议结束
    【本市讯】北平市总工会筹委会于上月三十、三十一两日连续召集市总工会各区办事处、各企业工厂工会及行业工会干部举行扩大干部会议，传达全国工会工作会议的精神。铁道部、财委会、市委、企业部、平津铁路局、市郊委、青委、劳动局、企业局、工商局、妇联、生产供销合作总社、修建处等有关机关干部也被邀参加，到会共八百余人。三十日，由市总工会筹委会主任萧明作全国工会工作会议关于工会组织问题的传达，他首先说明这次全国工会工作会议极为重要，中共中央非常重视，毛主席曾亲临大会向全体代表作亲切的指示，朱总司令两次莅会讲话，周副主席曾到会作政治报告。全国总工会根据刘少奇同志在一年左右把全国工人阶级基本上组织起来的指示，明确规定了工会工作主要的是把组织工人、建立工会工作搞好。接着他将大会关于工会组织中的名称、会员、会费、民主生活、组织系统、任务、编制、经费，以及与各方面的关系等问题作了详细的传达。他并将有关工会组织的问题归纳为以下几点：关于工会本身的，要广泛建立工会，发展会员，反对工会工作中的关门主义、形式主义；开展民主生活，真正实行工会民主制度，实行民主选举，改变委派制度，开展大家办工会运动，纠正包办代替；发扬工人阶级的团结互助精神，办好工人福利事业。最后，他号召工会干部遵照毛主席所指示的方向，继承工运先烈的艰苦作风，保证一年左右把北平工人阶级组织起来，完成上级指示给我们的光荣任务。
    会议第二天，首由张鸿舜同志传达关于开展民主运动与建立工厂管理委员会的问题，他除传达李立三同志的报告外，并总结了北平建立工厂管委会的几点经验，指出建立管委会时，要密切结合生产，以达到发展生产、减低成本、提高产品质量之目的；在建立工厂管委会时，必须通过职工代表会，以树立工人的主人翁思想。企业、工厂主管负责干部，应结合这一民主运动的开展作自我检讨，真正倾听工人群众意见。同时要展开两条路线的斗争，反对官僚主义、命令主义，也要反对极端民主与狭隘的单纯经济观点。刘莱夫同志根据会议的决议草案和李立三、刘子久两同志的报告，对处理劳资关系问题进行了重点传达，说明了目前劳资关系的基本情况、处理劳资关系的方针政策和为什么必须贯彻执行“发展生产、劳资两利”的方针。工人和工会对劳资纠纷可先用谈判、协商等方式解决，如谈判协商不成，再请劳动局调解、仲裁，如仍不得解决，最后可请法院判决。他着重指出：各行业应按一行一业的协商签订集体合同，这是解决私营企业中劳资争议的中心环节。继由马光斗同志分别就劳动局的性质、任务、组织、劳动争议、解决步骤、劳资双方目前的思想与活动方式等问题作了简单扼要的说明。最后，由张春久同志报告本市国药业协商签订集体合同的经验；张晓梅同志传达蔡畅同志关于女工工作的报告。
