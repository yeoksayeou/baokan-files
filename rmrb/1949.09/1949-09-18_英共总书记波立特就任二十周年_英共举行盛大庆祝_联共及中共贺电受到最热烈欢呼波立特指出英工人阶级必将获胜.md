Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 17th: London Dispatch: On the evening of September 11th, the British Communist Party and representatives of the London working class held a grand meeting in St. Pancras Town Hall to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Pollitt's inauguration as General Secretary of the British Communist Party. This was the most enthusiastic meeting seen in London for a long time, with people packed inside and outside the hall. Campbell, editor of the London Daily Worker, addressed the meeting, saying: Pollitt will be praised as an advanced fighter for a socialist Britain. While many Labour Party leaders pursue the dazzling favors of capitalism, Pollitt has always been loyal to the working class. Campbell recounted many major events of the past 20 years, illustrating how the British Communist Party has consistently been the best party in Britain, always under Pollitt's leadership, putting forward policies that can provide the greatest benefit to the British people. Campbell emphasized: Attlee, Bevin, and Lawther's attacks on the British Communist Party are only a praise for the work of the British Communist Party, for the work of the General Secretary of the British Communist Party, Pollitt.

Telegrams of congratulation from communist parties around the world were read at the meeting. First was the telegram from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, followed by the telegram from the Chinese Communist Party signed by Chairman Mao Zedong. These two telegrams received particularly warm applause. At the meeting, the Executive Committee of the British Communist Party, the Communist Youth League, and various branches of the British Communist Party sent congratulatory gifts to Pollitt. Pollitt rose to deliver a reply amidst fervent and continuous applause. He said: If I were not deeply moved and proud of the many awards and encouragement given to me in recent days by our own comrades and comrades of the international communist movement, I would not be telling the truth. After tracing the arduous struggles of the British Communist Party in the past 20 years, Pollitt pointed out to the conference with full confidence: "In 1929, I accepted your decision - to work hard for 20 years. Now, I am proud to have implemented this decision and am ready to do another 20 years with your support. I know that the working class will one day overthrow the declining and corrupt groups that rule us today and achieve victory in Britain. I know that the Communist Party will lead this struggle until victory."

　　英共总书记波立特就任二十周年
  　英共举行盛大庆祝           
    联共及中共贺电受到最热烈欢呼波立特指出英工人阶级必将获胜
    【新华社布拉格十七日电】伦敦航讯：九月十一日晚间，英国共产党和伦敦工人阶级代表在圣潘克拉区大厅举行盛大会议，庆祝英共总书记波立特就任二十周年纪念。这是伦敦很久以来所仅见的最热烈的一次会议，场内场外挤满了人。伦敦工人日报编辑甘贝尔在会上致辞说：波立特将以争取社会主义的英国的先进战士而为人称颂。当许多工党领袖追求着资本主义眩人心目的恩赐时，波立特始终对工人阶级忠诚不渝。甘贝尔历述二十年来的许多大事，说明英国共产党如何一贯是英国最优秀的政党，始终在波立特领导下，提出可以给英国人民以最大利益的政策。甘贝尔强调说：艾德礼，贝文和劳瑟对英共的攻击，只是对英共的工作，对英共总书记波立特的工作的一种赞扬。
    会上宣读了世界各国共产党发来的贺电。首先是苏联共产党的贺电，其次是中国共产党由毛泽东主席署名的贺电，这两份贺电受到了特别热烈的欢呼。会上，英共执行委员会、共产主义青年团和英共各支部向波立特致送贺礼。波立特在狂热不息的鼓掌中起立致答辞。他说：如果说最近几天来我们自己同志们和国际共产主义运动的同志们给我的许多嘉奖勉励没有使我深受感动，并引以为荣，那我就不是说真话了。波立特追溯英共在过去二十年中的艰巨斗争后，满怀信心地向大会指出：“在一九二九年，我接受了你们的决定——刻苦工作二十年。现在，我引以为豪地执行了这个决定，并准备在你们的支持下再来二十年。我知道，工人阶级终有一天推翻今天统治我们的没落腐朽的集团，而在英国取得胜利。我知道共产党将领导这个斗争，直到胜利为止。”
