Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 16th. The Central Plains People's Government issued the Rent Reduction and Interest Rate Reduction Regulations on the 12th. The full text of the proclamation is as follows:

	Proclamation of the Central Plains People's Government

Due to the long-term aggression of imperialism, the multi-layered oppression and exploitation by bureaucratic capital and feudal forces, the land in old China was mostly concentrated in the hands of the unearned landlord class. The vast majority of working farmers, on the contrary, had no land or very little land, and had no choice but to cultivate the land from landlords and borrow grain and seeds for a living, and thus endured heavy rent, high interest, cheap sales, expensive purchases, and various feudal exploitations. The more concentrated the land, the heavier the rent and interest, the more miserable the lives of farmers, and the more the land productivity tended to decline. The result of this decline in productivity was poor harvests, an increase in wasteland, continuous natural disasters such as floods, droughts, wind, and insect pests, which bankrupted most of the farmers who accounted for more than 80 percent of the population, and greatly reduced purchasing power, which in turn led to urban depression, industrial and commercial depression, worker unemployment, and educational decline. These unemployed masses and bankrupt farmers suffered from hunger and cold every day. The old and weak died in their villages, while the strong took risks, and the local tyrants and evil gentry took the opportunity to exploit them, and imperialism manipulated them from within. This is the basic root cause of bandits everywhere, warlords rampant, incessant civil wars, and frequent foreign insults in old China. To change this tragic phenomenon and transform the semi-colonial and semi-feudal old China into an independent, peaceful, democratic, prosperous, and strong new China, it is necessary to thoroughly reform this feudal and semi-feudal land system, realize that those who till the land own it, abolish heavy rent and high interest, so that all working farmers have land to cultivate, food to eat, clothes to wear, and houses to live in, thereby greatly increasing rural productivity and farmers' purchasing power, enabling industry and commerce to develop greatly, the market to prosper, the cause of culture and education to be revitalized, the unemployed people to have work, the idlers and vagrants to be transformed, the bandits to be eradicated, and the social order to be stabilized. Therefore, this land reform has become the basic policy of the new democratic country and the People's Government. However, to carry out land reform, there must be full preparation. Today, the war in the front has not ended, and there are still scattered bandits in the rear causing disturbances, and the vast number of farmers still lack a high degree of political awareness and a strict organization. Under such circumstances, it is not easy to achieve good results if land reform is carried out hastily. Therefore, in order to meet the current urgent needs of the farmers in the new areas, this government, in accordance with Article 7 of Chapter 8 of the People's Liberation Army's Code of Conduct, announces that it will first implement rent reduction and interest rate reduction in the newly liberated areas, initially improve the lives of farmers, start rural production and construction, gradually restore the rural economy and urban industry and commerce, and stabilize the social order, so as to unite the people of all strata, concentrate forces to completely eliminate the Kuomintang remnants, and quickly liberate all of China. The New Liberated Areas Rent Reduction and Interest Rate Reduction Regulations are hereby formulated and promulgated, and it is hoped that governments at all levels and people everywhere will abide by them!

	New Liberated Areas Rent Reduction and Interest Rate Reduction Regulations

Chapter 1 General Provisions

Article 1: This regulation is promulgated to meet the current requirements of farmers in the newly liberated areas, improve farmers' lives, develop agricultural production, unite the people of all strata, support the front, liberate the whole country, and consolidate the people's democratic liberated areas.

Chapter 2 Regarding Rent Reduction

Article 2: All land rented out by landlords, old-style rich peasants, and all institutions, schools, ancestral halls, temples, and churches shall be subject to rent reduction in accordance with these regulations. Those who violate this shall not only be ordered to implement rent reduction in accordance with these regulations and return the over-collected rent to the original tenants, but shall also be punished according to law.

Article 3: Regardless of the form of tenancy, the original rent shall be reduced by 25%. That is, if the original rent was one *shi* of grain, it will be reduced by two *dou* and five *sheng*. The reduced rent shall not exceed 375 per thousand of the land's regular yield. Those exceeding shall be reduced further. If the rent is less than 375 per thousand after the 25% reduction, the rent shall be paid according to the rent after the 25% reduction, and shall not be increased.

Article 4: All by-products of the rented land (such as wheat straw, rice straw, melons and beans on the edge of the field, etc.) shall belong to the tenants. However, by-products (such as tea, mulberry, *muzi*, tung oil, etc.) which originally belonged entirely to the farmers shall still belong to the farmers as before; those originally shared by the landlord and the tenant shall be reduced by 25% according to the original distribution; those originally belonging entirely to the landlord shall be distributed in proportion to the reduced rent.

Article 5: Land rent (rent *ke*) shall be paid after the harvest of agricultural products, and land rent shall not be collected in advance. It is forbidden for second landlords to sublet land and all illegal extra exploitation (such as various uncompensated labor, gift-giving, etc.).

Article 6: The deposit rent system is abolished. The deposit rent paid by the original tenants to the landlords shall be returned to the original tenants according to the actual price at the time of payment.

Article 7: The rent reduction period shall be implemented from the time of establishment of the people's government in each county. Rent arrears before the establishment of the people's government shall be waived.

Article 8: For families of poor revolutionary soldiers and revolutionary staff, urban workers, poor freelancers, and widowers, widows, orphans, and the disabled, etc., who rent out a small amount of land due to lack of labor (not exceeding the average land owned by local middle peasants), the rent may be reduced less or not reduced at all after consultation with the government and the farmers' association.

Article 9: The tenancy relationship between middle peasants and poor peasants should be regarded as an internal problem of the farmers, and should be handled by both parties through negotiation and mediation by the farmers' association in accordance with the principle of unity and mutual assistance.

Article 10: After the rent reduction, the tenancy rights should be effectively protected, and it is strictly forbidden to withdraw land, seize tenants, and seize tenants in disguised form. Those who have permanent tenancy rights in the contract or in custom shall continue to be valid. Those without permanent tenancy rights, the landlord and the tenant should sign a longer-term (more than three years) contract, so that farmers can produce with peace of mind. During the effective period of the contract, the landlord shall not take back the land. After the expiration of the contract, when the landlord recruits tenants or mortgages or sells the land, the original tenant has the priority to rent, mortgage, and purchase. If the landlord, old-style rich peasant, needs to take back part of the land for self-cultivation or hiring people for cultivation for livelihood, he should also take care of the lives of the original tenants and reduce the rent of the unreturned part of the land to subsidize them.

Article 11: After the rent reduction, the people's government and the farmers' association may appropriately adjust the tenancy rights based on the principle of voluntariness (such as tenant rich peasants who cultivate too much land), so that poor farmers who cultivate too little land can increase a part of the cultivated land to maintain their lives.

Article 12: After the rent reduction, the old contract should be destroyed and a new contract should be signed by both parties. After the landlord reduces the rent according to the contract, the tenant shall also pay the rent according to the contract. However, if the harvest is poor due to irresistible disasters (such as war, flood, drought, wind, insect pests, etc.), it shall be reduced or exempted as appropriate.

Chapter 3 Regarding Interest Rate Reduction and Debt Clearing

Article 13: Old debts owed by farmers to landlords and old-style rich peasants before liberation shall be repaid with interest at a monthly rate of 1.5% (that is, 1.5% interest shall be paid per yuan per month). If the interest paid in the past exceeds the principal by one time, the interest shall be stopped and the principal shall be repaid. If it exceeds the principal by two times, the principal and interest shall be stopped. After the old debt is cleared, the land and property mortgaged for the debt shall be returned to the farmers immediately. Those that have been established for sale shall not be moved.

Article 14: The sale of loans with agricultural products priced in advance (such as releasing green seedlings) is essentially also usury, and the price set in advance is invalid and should be calculated at the market price at the time of delivery. The interest on the original loan shall be calculated at half interest before the establishment of the people's government. After the establishment of the people's government, it shall be freely agreed upon by both parties.

Article 15: Debt disputes between middle peasants and poor peasants shall be mediated by the government and the farmers' association as internal problems of the farmers.

Article 16: Accounts for goods sales and commercial credit are not subject to interest rate reduction and debt clearing.

Article 17: The interest rate reduction referred to in this chapter refers to debts borrowed before liberation. From now on, the interest rate for borrowing and lending shall be freely agreed upon by the people, and the government may stipulate the interest rate.

Chapter 4 Handling Special Land Issues

Article 18: If local tyrants, evil gentry, landlords, and rich peasants forcefully occupy farmers' land, and the government verifies the facts after the farmers report it, the occupied land shall be returned to the original owner without compensation.

Article 19: Those who are indeed key counter-revolutionary elements shall be sentenced by the government organs above the commissioner's office in accordance with the law. Their land should be confiscated and distributed to farmers who have no land or less land. However, family members who have not participated in criminal activities should retain the land they are entitled to.

Article 20: Since the 26th year of the Republic of China, if landlords and old-style rich peasants take advantage of the disaster to buy cheaply (or in disguised form) and mortgage farmers' land, the farmers may request the people's government to investigate and verify the facts, and redeem it at the original price.

Article 21: The land of fleeing landlords and rich peasants may be managed by their relatives and friends on their behalf. If no one manages it, the local people's government shall manage it on their behalf. After the tenants reduce the rent according to law, they shall pay the rent to the government, and the government shall deduct the burden they should pay. When the original owner returns, it shall be returned together with the land.

Article 22: Clan fields, community fields, public fields, and school fields shall be managed by the management committee organized by the people of the clan, village, and region. In addition to paying the burden, the income may be used for running schools, helping the poor, providing disaster relief, or other public welfare undertakings after public discussion.

Article 23: Public wasteland shall be allocated by the government to poor farmers for reclamation (but forests shall not be damaged due to reclamation) and shall belong to them. The private wasteland of landlords and old-style rich peasants should first be allowed to be reclaimed by the owners; if the owners are unable or unwilling to reclaim it, the government may recruit people to reclaim it. The ownership of the land still belongs to the original owner, and the reclaimers have permanent tenancy rights. In order to encourage production, no rent or burden shall be paid for barren land within five years and cultivated wasteland within three years.

Article 24: When confiscating the land of key counter-revolutionary elements and distributing public wasteland as mentioned in Articles 19 and 23, the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers who are poor have priority in receiving distribution.

Chapter 5 Supplementary Provisions

Article 25: The Farmers' Association is a legitimate organization for carrying out rent reduction and interest rate reduction. All land rent, usury, borrowing interest, etc. in rural areas shall be mediated by the Farmers' Association, but the final decision-making power belongs to the people's government above the district level.

Article 26: Protect the property, legitimate business, and legitimate rights and interests of all industrialists and businessmen from infringement, including the industry and commerce concurrently operated by landlords and rich peasants.

Article 27: Disputes among tenants and others regarding rural burdens (such as public grain and public grass) shall be handled in accordance with the principle of rent reduction.

Article 28: In the semi-old areas, the land and property of landlords and old-style rich peasants that have been distributed to farmers shall not be reversed. Those who violate this shall be punished by the People's Government. The specific handling shall be implemented in accordance with the separate laws promulgated by the local provincial government.

Article 29: Each provincial government shall formulate implementation measures in accordance with the principles stipulated in these regulations and the specific conditions of the local area, and implement them after approval by this government.

Article 30: These regulations only apply to rural and suburban land. Real estate and housing property and debt issues in cities shall be formulated separately.

Article 31: The right to amend and interpret these regulations belongs to the Central Plains People's Government.

Article 32: These regulations shall be implemented from the date of promulgation.

　　中原人民政府发布减租减息条例
    【新华社汉口十六日电】中原人民政府十二日发布了减租减息条例。布告全文如下：
    　　　　中原人民政府布告
    由于帝国主义的长期侵略，官僚资本与封建势力的层层压迫与剥削，旧中国的土地，大部分集中于不劳而获的地主阶级手里，绝大部分劳动农民，反而没有土地或很少土地，而不得不向地主佃耕土地借粮借种以为生，因而忍受重租高利、贱卖贵买及各种封建剥削。土地越集中，租息就越重，农民生活就越苦，土地生产力也就越趋于衰落。此种生产力衰落的结果，就造成年成歉收、荒地增多、水旱风虫灾荒不断，使占人口百分之八十以上的农民大部破产，购买力大大减低，因而又形成城市萧条，工商凋敝、工人失业、教育不振。这些失业群众以及破产农民日受饥寒交迫，老弱者困死乡闾，强壮者挺而走险，而豪强恶霸即乘机利用，帝国主义则从中操纵，这就是旧中国土匪遍地，军阀横行，内战不息，外侮频仍的基本根源。要改变这种悲惨现象，使半殖民地半封建的旧中国成为独立、和平、民主、富强的新中国，必须贯彻改革这种封建半封建的土地制度，实现耕者有其田，废除重租高利，使劳动农民大家有田耕、有饭吃、有衣穿、有房子住，因而大大提高农村生产力与农民购买力，使工商业得以大大发展，市场得以繁荣，文化教育事业得以振兴，失业人民得有工作，游手好闲无业游民得以改造，盗匪得以绝迹，社会秩序得以安定。所以这种土地改革便成为新民主主义国家与人民政府的基本政策。但要进行土地改革，必须有充分的准备，今天前方战争尚未结束，后方还有散匪扰乱，广大农民还缺乏高度的政治觉悟与严密组织。在此种情况下，如仓猝进行土地改革，实不易取得良好效果。因此本府为适应新区农民当前迫切要求，特遵照人民解放军约法八章第七条之规定，宣布在新解放地区首先实行减租减息，初步改善农民生活，开始乡村生产建设，逐渐恢复农村经济与城市工商业，安定社会秩序，以便团结各阶层人民，集中力量彻底消灭国民党残余势力，迅速解放全中国。兹特制定新区减租减息条例公布之，希望各级政府及各地人民一体遵行为要！
