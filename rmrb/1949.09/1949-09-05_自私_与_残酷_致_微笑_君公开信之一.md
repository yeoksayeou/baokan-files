　　"Selfishness" and "Cruelty"
    ——Open Letter to Mr. "Smile" (Part One)
    Dong Qian
    You believe that the revolution cannot solve "personal and family difficulties," and for this, you "couldn't help but shed a few tears of sadness"; and from this, you draw the conclusion: "Selfishness cannot be eradicated at the root," and "Revolution is cruel"?! You even specifically declare: "I insist on this theory!" This is a "materialistic viewpoint"!
    Now, regardless of your motives, let us examine the "source" of "selfishness" and who the real cruel people are from the perspective of historical materialism.
    Indeed, selfishness and cruelty have existed since the existence of class society; therefore, it is a product of class society. Although Mencius once said, "Human nature is good," this is a trans-class statement, viewing good and evil as a transcendental metaphysics and morality, becoming a tool for rulers to oppress the working people. As the common sayings "If a man doesn't look out for himself, heaven and earth will punish him," and "Man is a selfish and self-interested animal," represent the life philosophy of the oppressing class and the exploiting class, becoming a customary law for maintaining private society, and dominating the ideological sphere of the entire private society.
    Therefore, people have class character, and selfishness and cruelty also have class character. "Selfishness" and "cruelty" were originally twins, two-in-one; exploiters must be "selfish" and therefore must be "cruel" to the exploited, and the reason they are so "cruel" is also to achieve the purpose of "selfishness."
    Please open the history books and see that the most "selfish" and most "cruel" people are those who hold the ruling power: nobles, emperors, feudal landlords, and bureaucratic classes. In the distant past, Empress Wu Zhao of the Tang Dynasty, during her twenty-two years in power, spared no effort in implementing the most cruel secret agent rule on the people in order to maintain her personal imperial rule. She suspected that the people of the country hated her, so she raised hundreds of ruffians specifically for whistleblowing. The cruel methods of interrogation included ten types of heavy cangues such as "fixing hundreds of veins" and "unable to breathe"; this cruel person, fearing that this was not "cruel" enough, cleverly created various names such as "Phoenix Spreading Wings," "Donkey Colt Pulling Pegs," "Immortal Presenting Fruit," "Jade Maiden Ascending Ladder," and so on. Hundreds of members of the Tang imperial family, hundreds of ministers, and countless officials and commoners suffered under these "cruel methods." Empress Wu Zhao wanted to satisfy her personal desires, while the people of the world suffered. Who is selfish? Who is cruel?!
    Looking at the more recent public enemy of the people, Chiang Kai-shek, he is the epitome of medieval barbarity and cruelty from ancient and modern times, both Chinese and foreign. Chiang's rule over China has also lasted exactly twenty-two years. In such a long period of time, there has hardly been a day or an event that has not faced the Chinese people with "selfishness" and "cruelty." Saying that he "says all the nice things but does all the bad things" is truly "well-deserved." In order to maintain the Chiang family dynasty, he did not hesitate to be servile and "surrender externally," selling China from heaven to earth through overt and covert methods; he did not hesitate to be vicious and "oppress internally," in addition to using extremely barbaric secret agent methods such as "flying airplanes" and "riding elevators," he also used the armed forces equipped by US imperialism to suppress the Chinese people. Who is selfish again? Who is cruel?!
    It is precisely because these reactionary classes are the most selfish and cruel, placing the people in dire straits, that there have been multiple peasant revolutions in history. Now, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people have finally overthrown the most selfish and cruel rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries in history, and are about to complete the great cause of the Chinese people's democratic revolution over the past century. For such a earth-shaking happy event, all the people of the world are jubilant and applaud, who can say that the people do not welcome such a rebirth and dislike "cruelty"? I am afraid that only those landlords, compradors, and bureaucratic bourgeoisie who have been overthrown by the revolution dislike "cruelty"!
    Indeed, the revolution is somewhat "cruel" to these reactionary oppressing classes. This is exactly what Chairman Mao said: "Return the way they treated others to themselves." Without this, it would not be enough to eliminate their cruelty. Even after the people's armed forces so "cruelly" destroyed the reactionary rule, the hidden reactionary forces are still constantly harming the people, which shows that the revolution must be bloody, and it is impossible to carry out a revolution with white gloves.
    Marx and Engels once told us: "Without violent revolution, it is impossible to replace the bourgeois state with the proletarian state." ("State and Revolution")
    Lenin also once said: "The liberation of the oppressed class requires not only a violent revolution, but also the abolition of the state power organs established by the ruling class." ("Lenin's Complete Works," Volume 21, page 373)
    Therefore, the so-called "cruelty" of the revolution only applies to the small number of reactionary ruling classes under certain revolutionary conditions. The purpose is very clear: it is not for the "selfish interests" of a few revolutionary leaders, but to guarantee the freedom and democratic rights of the majority of the people, so that more than ninety percent of the people can be liberated from cruel oppression in politics, economy, and culture (of course, the interests of revolutionary leaders are also consistent with the interests of the people). Can it be said that revolutionaries are acting for "selfishness"? And who can say that so many revolutionary martyrs sacrificed their lives for "selfishness"?
    Regarding who is "selfish" and who is for the people, Marx and Engels also made an essential analysis long ago:
    "The exploiting class needs political rule to maintain the system of exploitation, that is, to seek the selfish interests of a very small number of people against the vast majority of the people. The oppressed class needs political rule to completely eliminate all exploitation, that is, to seek the interests of the vast majority of the people against the modern small number of slave owners, namely landlords and capitalists." ("State and Revolution")
    So, is the revolution really "selfish" and "cruel"? I think you should understand from these two paragraphs, right? You must know that there is only one truth. The key to the problem lies in understanding it from what position and viewpoint.

### “自私”与“残酷”——致“微笑”君公开信之一

　　“自私”与“残酷”
    ——致“微笑”君公开信之一
    董谦
    你认为革命不能解决“个人与家庭的困难”，为此还“禁不住掉下几点心酸泪”；并从而得出这样的结论：“自私心不能连根拔去”，“革命是残酷的”？！甚至你还特别声明：“我是坚持此项理论的！”这是“唯物论的观点”！
    现在且不管你的动机是什么，我们就以历史唯物论的观点，来考究一下“自私”的“策源地”，以及谁是真正的残酷者吧。
    诚然，自私与残酷，自阶级社会存在以来即已存在，因之它是阶级社会的产物。虽然孟子曾经说过：“人性善也”，但这是超阶级的说法，把善与恶视为一种超世的玄学、道德观，而成为统治者压迫劳动人民的工具。如俗话常说的“人不为己，天诛地灭”、“人是自私自利的动物”这两句话，便是代表压迫阶级剥削阶级的人生哲学，而成为维护私有社会的一种习惯法，并支配着整个私有社会的思想界。
    因此，人是有阶级性的，自私与残酷也是有阶级性的，而“自私”与“残酷”原本是一母双胎，二而一的东西；剥削者要“自私”就必然对被剥削者要“残酷”，而其所以如此“残酷”也是为了达到“自私”的目的。
    请翻开历史看看，最“自私”最“残酷”者，还是那些握有统治权的贵族、帝王、封建地主、官僚阶级的人们。远者如：唐时太后武照在位二十二年，为了维护个人帝王之天下，不惜对人民施行最残酷的特务统治。她怀疑全国人厌恶她，便畜养了无赖数百人，专做告密工作。讯囚酷法就有“定百脉”、“喘不得”等十样大枷；这位残酷者唯恐此还不“残酷”，又巧立“凤凰洒翅”、“驴驹拔橛”、“仙人献果”、“玉女登梯”等各种名目。死于这种“酷法”下者，前后有唐宗室贵戚数百人、大臣数百家；刺史郎官以下直至庶民受苦者，那就数不可胜数了。武后为了她一人之私欲，而天下人遭殃，是谁自私？是谁残酷？！
    近者再看看这位人民公敌蒋介石，他更是集古今中外中世纪式的野蛮残酷之大成。蒋贼统治中国至今也恰恰是二十二年，在这样长久的岁月里，几无日无事不是以“自私”和“残酷”面对着中国人民，说他“好话说尽，坏事做绝”，真是“受之无愧”了。他为了维护蒋家皇朝，就不惜奴颜卑膝，“对外投降”，以明卖暗送的方法，把中国从天上卖到地下；就不惜穷凶极恶，“对内压迫”，除施用极野蛮之“坐飞机”、“坐电梯”等等特务酷法之外，更以美帝装备之武力来剿灭中国人民，这又是谁自私？谁残酷！？
    正因为这些反动的阶级最自私最残酷，置人民于水深火热之中，历史上才有多次的农民革命，而现在在中国共产党的领导下，中国人民才得以最后推翻历史上最自私最残酷的国民党反动派统治，而即将完成近百年来中国人民民主革命的大业。对这样翻天覆地的大喜事，天下万民莫不欢腾鼓舞，额手称庆，谁能说人民不欢迎这样的苏生而嫌“残酷”呢？恐怕只有那些被革命被打倒的地主、买办、官僚资产阶级嫌“残酷”吧！
    的确，革命对这些反动的压迫阶级说来，是有些“残酷”的，这正是毛主席所说：“以其人之道，还治其人之身”，不如此，就不足以消灭其残酷；甚至人民的武装那样“残酷”的摧毁了反动的统治，暗藏的反动势力还在不断地残害人民，足见革命是要流血的，带着白手套革命是不行的。
    马克思、恩格斯曾告诉我们说：“没有暴力革命，要以无产阶级的国家来代替资产阶级的国家，是不可能的。”（“国家与革命”）
    列宁也曾经说过：“被压迫阶级的解放，不仅非有强力革命不可，而且非消灭统治阶级所建立的国家政权机关不可。”（“列宁全集”第二十一卷，第三七三页）
    因此，所谓革命之“残酷”性，也只是在一定的革命条件下，对那些少数的反动统治阶级而言，其目的是很显然的，并不是为了几个革命领导者的“私利”，而是为了保障大多数人民的自由民主权利，使百分之九十以上的人民在政治上经济上文化上，从残酷的压迫下求得解放（当然革命领导者的利益也和人民的利益是一致的），这难道能说革命者是为了“自私”吗？又有谁能说多少革命的烈士，都是为了“自私”而舍身殉难吗？
    关于谁为“自私”，谁为人民，马克思、恩格斯也早做了本质的分析：
    “剥削阶级需要政治的统治，来维持剥削的制度，就是说来谋极少数人底自私的利益，反对最大多数的人民。被压迫阶级需要政治的统治，来完全消灭一切剥削，就是说来谋取最大多数人民底利益，以反对现代极少数的奴隶主，即地主和资本家。”（“国家与革命”）
    那么，革命究竟是否“自私”“残酷”，我想，你从这两段话里也该弄明白了吧？要知道，真理只有一个，问题的关键，是在于站在什么立场观点上来认识它。
