　　School Plays Should Integrate with Real Life
    Zhang Nan
    Drama is the most powerful weapon for direct propaganda (especially for young people). Therefore, students involved in drama at school should use it to educate and transform their fellow students.
    Since drama in schools is for the purpose of educating students, what kind of things should we perform? Because we are not familiar enough with the lives of workers, peasants, and soldiers, we can neither write well nor perform well about them. Therefore, we can write more about things related to student life, integrating drama with life, and after analyzing the problems in daily life, present them in drama. This can produce various forms of creative work that reflect life and are combat-effective. We should inspire and encourage students' enthusiasm for creation, not be afraid of being rough, take materials locally, and write about the people and things we are most familiar with in our lives. This will make it easier to write deeply and vividly, such as writing about the ideological transformation of students, or problems that occur in work and life, or common mistakes that most people make, or various exemplary figures and typical examples. These are the things that students are most concerned about, easily accepted by students, and have great educational significance. For example, in the past, at the Yan'an Cadre School, they wrote a script called "Dogmatism" targeting the serious errors made by cadres in their learning methods (it described a person who knew dialectical materialism, historical materialism, and Capital very well, but could not solve a very small practical problem, which shows that rote learning of dogmas is useless). After the play was performed, the cadres felt that it was talking about them, so they launched criticisms and self-examinations. As a result, everyone's thinking and learning were improved.
    After having a theme and content for the script, the form can be diversified. For example, before liberation, various schools created many new forms in the struggles of various student movements, such as cartoon dramas and living newspaper dramas. Because it was combined with reality and reflected reality, it played a great educational role inside and outside the school. In addition, before we write a script, we can exchange opinions with students more, which can help inspire our own thinking and collect more practical and vivid materials, making the content of the creation richer and deeper. We must take the things that come from the masses, refine them, improve them one step, and then take them to the masses to educate them. This is the mass line of literature and art, which is what Chairman Mao said, "from the masses, to the masses."
    Regarding directing, because we have little experience, we can exert collective strength—collective directing.
    Some students feel that acting often affects learning. This is a bias. Our main purpose of acting is to unite and educate students and help them progress. It should be coordinated with learning and ensure the thorough completion of the New Democratic education plan. We don't need to demand too much, and we must learn from professional performing arts groups to perform some large plays. That would more or less hinder learning. We can write some small scripts that are realistic and combat-effective in coordination with each movement.
    In short, if we want to develop drama in schools, we must appropriately coordinate drama with learning to ensure the completion of learning tasks. The wider our artistic creation vision, the better, and the more practical our creative feet, the better. We must go deep into the lives of students, because the learning and life of students is a kind of combat, is an infinite source of creation!

　　学校演戏要结合实生活
    张楠
    戏剧是直接宣传的最有力的武器（尤其对青年来说）。因此在校中搞戏剧的同学，就应该通过它去教育同学和改造同学。
    戏剧在学校既然是为教育同学，那么我们应该演些什么东西呢？因为我们对工农兵的生活不够熟悉，既写不出，也演不好。因此，我们可以多写与学生生活有关的东西，把戏剧和生活打成一片，将日常生活中的问题加以分析后，把它表现在戏剧上，这样可以产生反映生活的有战斗性的各种形式的创作。我们应该启发和鼓励同学们创作的积极性，不要怕粗糙，就地取材，写我们生活中最熟悉的人和事，这样也容易写得深刻和生动，譬如写同学的思想转变，或工作上生活上发生的问题，或大多数人易犯的错误，或各种模范的人物和典型的事例等，这些都是同学们最关切的，容易被同学接受，而得到的教育意义也大。例如从前在延安干部学校，他们针对干部在学习方法上犯的严重错误，写了一个剧本——“教条主义”（里面描写一个人把辩证唯物论、历史唯物论、资本论念的很熟，可是却不能解决一个很小的实际问题，这说明空背教条的学习方法是没有用处的），这个剧演出后，干部们都感到是在说自己，于是纷纷地展开批评和检讨。因此，每个人在思想和学习上都为之提高了。
    写剧本有了主题和内容后，形式可以多样化，譬如解放前，各校在历次学运的斗争中，创造出许多新形式，象卡通剧和活报剧等，它因为是结合实际，反映现实，在校内外起了很大的教育作用。另外，我们在写剧本之前，可以找同学多交换意见，这样能帮助启发自己的思想，和收集更多实际的与生动的资料，使创作的内容更丰富，更深刻，我们要把从群众中来的东西，经过洗炼，提高一步，再拿到群众中去教育他们，这就是文艺的群众路线，也就是毛主席说的“从群众中来，到群众中去”。
    关于导演，因为自己经验少，我们可以发挥集体力量——集体导演。
    有的同学感到演戏常常要影响学习，这是一种偏向，我们演戏主要目的是为团结教育同学和帮助同学进步，它是应该和学习配合，并保证新民主主义教育计划彻底地完成，我们不必要求过高，一定要学文工团演些大戏，那样是会或多或少地妨碍学习的，我们可以配合每次的运动，写些富有现实性和战斗性的小剧本。
    总之，我们要想把戏剧在校中开展起来，就必须将戏剧和学习适当地配合起来，保证学习任务的完成，我们艺术创作的眼越广越好，创作的脚越实越好，我们要深入同学的生活当中，因为同学的学习和生活就是一种战斗，就是一个无限的创作的源泉！
