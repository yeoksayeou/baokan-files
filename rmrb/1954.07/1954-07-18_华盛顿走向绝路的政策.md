Washington's Policy Leading to a Dead End
Wu Quan

The United States' occupation of our country's Taiwan has put Sino-American relations in a state of tension. In recent years, the various provocative conspiracies carried out by the United States in collusion with the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang have thoroughly exposed the United States' arrogant policy of hostility toward the People's Republic of China. It is precisely this policy that has repeatedly caused serious threats to the security and peace of Asia.

When former U.S. President Truman announced the occupation of Taiwan on June 27, 1950, he tried his best to portray this armed aggression as a temporary action. However, at that time, the U.S. occupation of Taiwan was carried out simultaneously with its launch of the war of aggression against Korea and the open intervention in the war in Indochina. Since then, the United States has continued to occupy Taiwan and intends to further use the Chiang Kai-shek remnant bandits to carry out military provocations against the People's Republic of China. After the Korean armistice, the United States intensified its intervention in the war in Indochina and has always deliberately attempted to expand the war to the People's Republic of China.

A group of reactionary congressmen from the United States' notorious so-called "China Lobby," such as Nolan and Judd, have frequently clamored for using the Chiang bandits to attack the Chinese mainland. Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs Robertson also shamelessly stated in his testimony to Congress on January 26 this year that the core of the United States' "current policy toward China and Taiwan is to maintain a constant threat of military action against Communist China, hoping that its internal collapse will occur at some point." It is with such arrogant goals in mind that the Pentagon has spared no expense in using 1 billion U.S. dollars worth of munitions to expand Chiang Kai-shek's army. Now Van Fleet even clamors to sign a so-called "bilateral mutual security agreement" with the Chiang bandits, antagonizing 600 million Chinese people and creating tension in Asia.

At the same time, the U.S. ruling clique is doing its utmost to obstruct capitalist countries from improving their relations with our country. Any remarks by far-sighted politicians in these countries who believe that the People's Republic of China and its international status and legitimate rights should be recognized will immediately arouse a burst of rage and attacks from the Washington ruling figures. The reason why the U.S. ruling clique is so barbaric and unreasonable is that if it cannot force these countries to continue to follow U.S. policies, then international tensions will be greatly eased, the threat to Asian peace can be greatly reduced, and Wall Street's pursuit of war profits may be thwarted.

Recently, as the United States' policy of aggression in Asia has repeatedly suffered setbacks, the forces striving to ease international tensions have grown stronger, and the People's Republic of China's peaceful diplomatic policy has gained increasingly broad understanding and support from countries around the world, its international status and prestige have rapidly increased, and the U.S. ruling clique has become even more furious, reaching a point of complete loss of reason. On July 10 and 13, the Foreign Affairs Committees of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives, after a frenzy of clamoring, successively passed resolutions opposing the restoration of the People's Republic of China's legitimate rights in the United Nations.

This shows that the U.S. ruling clique is attempting to resist the objective situation that it cannot resist, determined to tie a knot in its relationship with the People's Republic of China, force other countries to follow it, and engage in new adventures in Asia. On January 5 this year, the "Christian Science Monitor" wrote: "The initial purpose of the non-recognition policy was to find some way to eventually return Chiang Kai-shek to a position of controlling China. This is still the goal that some important figures in Washington, especially Nolan, Robertson, and Radford, are willing to achieve."

The United States' policy of hostility toward the People's Republic of China thoroughly violates international agreements and violates all standards of international conduct.

Taiwan is China's sacred and inviolable territory. The "Cairo Declaration" and the "Potsdam Proclamation," personally signed by the U.S. President, both affirmed that Taiwan belongs to China. Former U.S. President Truman, in a statement issued on January 5, 1950, also reiterated the above two solemn international agreements and stated: "The United States Government has always advocated good faith in international relations. ... The United States has no predatory ambitions on Taiwan or other Chinese territories. The United States has no intention of acquiring special rights or privileges or establishing military bases in Taiwan. The United States does not intend to use armed forces to interfere in its present situation. ... Similarly, the United States Government does not intend to provide military assistance or advice to the Chinese forces in Taiwan (referring to the Chiang Kai-shek remnant bandit forces)." However, Truman's words were completely abandoned by himself in less than a few months. In the eyes of the American aggressors, all international agreements and its own statements are worthless.

Secondly, the Atlantic Charter, which the United States has always flaunted, stipulates that it is willing to "respect the right of all peoples to freely determine the form of government under which they will live." The recent joint declaration of the Washington Anglo-American talks also stated that they "reaffirmed" the "principles of the Atlantic Charter." This principle can play a positive role in international affairs. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence established in the joint statements of the Sino-Indian and Sino-Burmese talks also include this principle. However, for the government of the United States of America, the signatory and advocate of the Atlantic Charter, which is still clamoring for hostility toward the People's Republic of China today, has this principle not become a great irony?

Therefore, the United States' continued implementation of this lawless policy can only mean adhering to its morally bankrupt and disreputable policy.

Everyone sees that the People's Republic of China, created by the Chinese people according to their own will, is absolutely unshakable, its strength is growing day by day, and its friendship and unity with the people of all countries is growing day by day. What will be the result of the United States' attempt to use a small group of rotten Chiang Kai-shek remnant bandits to antagonize 600 million Chinese people and lead to new military adventures is very clear.

It is obvious that the United States' arrogant and dangerous policy is getting less and less support from anyone. Only those who have lost confidence in tomorrow will be willing to entrust their fate to the United States and link it with the outlaws in Taiwan. Now, whether in Asia, Europe, or Africa, and even within the United States, there are calls against this U.S. policy. This is because this U.S. policy violates the true interests of all countries, including the United States.

During the recent debate on foreign affairs in the British House of Commons, the issue of policy toward China became the most prominent issue. This is not accidental. Eden expressed to the House of Commons the British government's desire to improve relations with the People's Republic of China. In this debate, many members criticized the United States' occupation of Taiwan and its policy of hostility toward the People's Republic of China. British Labour Party leader Attlee believes that it is wrong, unwise, and contrary to the principles of the United Nations to exclude China from the United Nations. He also pointed out: "There are some impatient people who still want to wage war against Communist China and want Chiang Kai-shek to be restored. I think this idea is foolish from a military point of view, and from a political point of view, it ignores all the lessons of history."

The United States' policy of hostility toward China is even more untenable in Asia. Indian Prime Minister Nehru recently stated that "the balance of power in Asia has undergone some historical changes" and that "to fail to recognize People's China is like closing one's eyes to the reality of Asia." The people of Asia generally demand the establishment of relations between countries based on the principles of peaceful coexistence and joint efforts to consolidate peace in Asia. This historical trend is already unstoppable.

Within the United States, calls for adopting a realistic policy are also growing. The American "Christian Science Monitor" admitted on May 6 that the United States' policy of "non-recognition" of China "is almost like the proverb about ostriches burying their heads in the sand." The American people, like the people of all countries in the world, demand peace, and they hope to establish normal and friendly relations with the people of all countries. Therefore, the U.S. ruling clique's collusion with the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and its opposition to 600 million Chinese people, which makes the United States isolated from the world, obviously seriously violates the wishes of the American people and rudely damages the dignity of the American people.

It has become increasingly clear that the U.S. ruling clique's policy of hostility toward the Chinese people will inevitably be met with opposition from all sides, and it has no way out at all. If the U.S. ruling clique stubbornly continues to act recklessly, it will undoubtedly bring serious consequences to itself.

    华盛顿走向绝路的政策
    吴全
    美国侵占我国台湾的行为，使中美关系处于紧张状态。几年来美国勾结蒋介石残余匪帮所进行的种种挑衅性的阴谋活动，彻底地暴露了美国敌视中华人民共和国的狂妄政策。正是这个政策，使得亚洲的安全与和平一再遭到严重的威胁。
    美国前总统杜鲁门在一九五○年六月二十七日宣布侵占台湾时，竭力企图把这种武装侵略说成是临时的行动，但在当时，美国侵占台湾是和它发动侵朝战争，开始对印度支那战争的公开干涉，同时进行的。此后美国就继续占据台湾，而且要进一步利用蒋介石残兵败将来向中华人民共和国进行军事挑衅。朝鲜停战后，美国加紧干涉印度支那战争，并一直蓄意把战争扩大到中华人民共和国。
    美国臭名远扬的所谓“援华院外活动集团”的一群反动议员，如诺兰、周以德之流就经常叫嚣利用蒋匪进攻中国大陆。负责远东事务的助理国务卿罗伯逊今年一月二十六日在议会作证时也恬不知耻地声言美国“现在对中国和台湾的政策的中心是对共产党中国保持一种行将采取军事行动的经常威胁，希望在某一时机其内部将起崩溃。”正是怀抱着这样的狂妄目的，五角大楼不惜以十亿美元的军火来扩充蒋介石军队，现在范佛里特更扬言要和蒋匪签订所谓“共同安全双边协定”，与六亿中国人民为敌，制造亚洲的紧张局势。
    与此同时，美国统治集团竭力阻挠资本主义国家改善与我国之间的关系，所有这些国家有远见的政治家任何认为应该承认中华人民共和国及其国际地位和合法权利的言论，都要立即引起华盛顿统治人物的一阵暴怒和攻击。美国统治集团所以这样蛮横无理，是因为如果它不能强使这些国家继续追随美国的政策，那末，国际紧张局势就会大大缓和，亚洲和平所受到的威胁就可以大大减轻，华尔街追求的战争利润就有落空的可能。
    最近以来，由于美国侵略亚洲的政策一再遭到挫败，争取缓和国际紧张局势的力量日益壮大，中华人民共和国的和平外交政策得到世界各国越来越广泛的了解和支持，国际地位和声望随之迅速提高，美国统治集团也就更加显得暴跳如雷，达到了完全丧失理性的地步。七月十日和十三日美国参议院和众议院的外交委员会，在一阵狂热的叫嚣后，先后通过了反对恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利的决议。
    这是表明美国统治集团企图抵挡事实证明它们抵挡不了的客观形势，一心要在和中华人民共和国的关系上打下死结，强迫其他国家跟着它走，在亚洲进行新的冒险。今年一月五日“基督教科学箴言报”写道：“不承认政策的最初目的，就是要寻找一些办法以便最后使蒋介石回到控制中国的地位去。这仍旧是华盛顿的一些重要人物特别是诺兰、罗伯逊和雷德福等人所愿意达到的目标。”
    美国推行的这种敌视中华人民共和国的政策，彻头彻尾地破坏国际协议，违背一切国际行为的准则。
    台湾是中国的神圣不可侵犯的领土。美国总统亲自签了字的“开罗宣言”和“波茨坦公告”，都确定台湾属于中国。前美国总统杜鲁门在一九五○年
  一月五日发表的声明中，还重述了上述两项庄严的国际协议，并且表明：“美国政府向来主张在国际关系中应具有诚意。……美国对台湾或中国其他领土从无掠夺的野心。现在美国亦无意在台湾获取特别权益或特权或建立军事基地。美国亦不拟使用武装部队干预其现在的局势。……同样地美国政府也不拟对在台湾的中国军队（指蒋介石残余匪帮军队）供给军事援助或提供意见。”但是，杜鲁门的话说过不到几个月，就被他自己彻底背弃了。在美国侵略者的眼中，一切国际协议和它自己的声明，都是不值一文钱的。
    其次，美国一直标榜的大西洋宪章，规定愿“尊重各民族自由决定其所赖以生存之政府形式之权利”。最近的华盛顿英美会谈联合宣言，又表明他们
  “重新肯定”了“大西洋宪章原则”。这种原则是可以在国际事务中起积极的作用的。中印、中缅会谈联合声明确立的指导国际关系的五项原则，也包含了这一个原则在内。但是，这个原则，对于今天仍在叫嚣敌视中华人民共和国的大西洋宪章的签字国和鼓吹者——美利坚合众国的政府来说，不是成了绝大的讽刺了吗？
    因此，美国继续推行这种无法无天的政策，只能意味着坚持它在道义上彻底破产，使自己声名扫地的政策。
  谁都看到，中国人民按照自己的意志所创立的中华人民共和国是绝对不可动摇的，它的力量天天在壮大，它和各国人民的友好与团结天天在增长。美国想利用一小撮腐烂了的蒋介石残余匪帮，来和六亿中国人民为敌，导向新的军事冒险，这会有什么结果，是清清楚楚的。
    很显然，美国这种狂妄的危险的政策，是越来越得不到什么人的支持的。只有失掉明天的信心的人才会甘心把自己的命运交由美国去和台湾的亡命之徒联结起来。现在，不论是在亚洲，或是在欧洲和非洲，以至在美国国内，到处都发出反对美国这种政策的呼声。这就是因为美国这种政策，是违反各国包括美国在内的真正的利益的。
    日前英国下院举行外交问题的辩论中，对中国的政策问题成为最突出的问题。这就不是偶然的。艾登曾向下院表示英国政府关于改善与中华人民共和国关系的愿望。在这次辩论中，许多议员都抨击美国侵占台湾和敌视中华人民共和国的政策。英国工党领袖艾德礼认为把中国排斥在联合国之外是错误的、不智的，而且是与联合国原则相违背的。他并指出：“有些性急的人，他们仍然想对共产党中国进行战争，想让蒋介石复辟。我认为，这种想法，从军事方面说，是愚蠢的，从政治方面说，它忽视了历史的一切教训。”
      美国敌视中国的政策，在亚洲更是行不通了。印度总理尼赫鲁最近表示：“亚洲的力量对比已有了某种历史性的变化”，“不承认人民中国就像是对亚洲的现实闭起眼睛来一样”。亚洲人民普遍要求按照和平共处的原则建立各国之间的关系，并共同努力巩固亚洲的和平。这个历史的潮流已经是不可抵挡的了。
    在美国国内，要求采取现实政策的呼声也正在增长。五月六日的美国“基督教科学箴言报”承认，美国“不承认”中国的政策，“就跟谚语所说驼鸟把头埋在沙土中的行径差不多”。美国人民和世界各国人民一样，是要求和平的，他们希望和世界各国人民建立正常的和友好的关系，因此美国统治集团勾结蒋介石匪帮，和六亿中国人民作对，使美国自绝于世人的政策，显然是严重地违背了美国人民的愿望，粗暴地损害了美国人民的尊严的。
    事情已经越来越清楚了，美国统治集团敌视中国人民的政策必然遭到四面八方的反对，它是根本没有出路的。美国统治集团如果不顾一切地蛮干下去，那就要给它自己带来严重的恶果，这是毫无疑问的。
