Xinhua News Agency, Paris, July 15th: TASS reports that the French Minister of the Interior's ban on the routine demonstration commemorating the anniversary of the storming of the Bastille on July 14th has aroused the anger of the French democratic public.

    "L'Humanité" published a protest from the French Communist Party, which emphasized "the seriousness of this new infringement upon constitutionally guaranteed freedoms and democratic traditions."

    The protest stated: "It cannot be overlooked that one of the main reasons for banning the July 14th demonstration is Dulles' hurried visit to Paris. The U.S. Secretary of State, who is frantically opposed to the conclusion of a ceasefire agreement on Indochina, is attempting to single-handedly erase the progress made in the recent stage of the Geneva negotiations and obstruct the establishment of the peace desired by the nation."

    The French Communist Party called on all organizations to join the protest lodged by the mass demonstration organizing committee.

    The Communist Party also called on the French working people to send delegations to Geneva, demanding that the French representatives strive to achieve a cessation of the war in Indochina—the first step in pursuing a policy of peace, national independence, freedom, and social progress.

    The French General Confederation of Labor also issued a strong protest against the ban on the July 14th parade.

    A delegation from the mass demonstration organizing committee met with the Minister of the Interior yesterday and lodged a firm protest.

    Today, the organizing committee issued a notice calling on residents of Paris and its suburbs to actively participate in regional demonstrations, such as rallies, parades, mass dances, etc., to express their unwavering determination to fight for the defense of peace, freedom, and national independence.

    法国民主公众抗议法政府禁止例行的示威游行
    法共号召法国人民努力求得印度支那和平
    【新华社十五日讯】塔斯社巴黎十四日讯：法国内政部长禁止在七月十四日举行纪念攻克巴士底狱周年的例行示威游行，引起了法国民主公众的愤怒。
    “人道报”刊载了法国共产党的抗议，抗议中着重指出了“这一对宪法规定的自由和民主传统的新的侵害行为的严重性”。
    抗议中写道：“不能不看到，禁止七月十四日示威游行的主要原因之一就是杜勒斯的匆匆来到巴黎。疯狂反对缔结关于印度支那停战协定的美国国务卿企图一手抹煞日内瓦谈判最近阶段所取得的进展，并阻挠建立全国所希望的和平。”
    法国共产党号召一切团体组织参加群众示威游行组织委员会提出的抗议。
    共产党还号召法国劳动人民派代表团到日内瓦，要求法国代表努力求得停止印度支那战争——这是推行和平、民族独立、自由和社会进步的政策的第一步。
    法国总工会也提出激烈的抗议，反对禁止七月十四日的游行。
    群众示威游行组织委员会的代表团昨日进见了内政部长，向他提出坚决的抗议。
    今天组织委员会发表通告，号召巴黎市内和市郊的居民积极参加地区性的示威运动，如群众大会、游行、群众舞会等，以表示自己为保卫和平、自由和民族独立而不屈不挠地斗争的意志。
