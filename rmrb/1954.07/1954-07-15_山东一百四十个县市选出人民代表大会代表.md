    People's Congress delegates at the county and city levels have been elected in 140 counties and cities in Shandong Province. The first sessions of the first People's Congresses have now been convened in most of the province's counties and cities.

    The election of delegates to the first People's Congresses in the counties and cities was conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Electoral Law. Before the elections, all localities generally carried out extensive publicity in conjunction with their central tasks. They effectively promoted the spirit of democracy during the elections, and therefore, the elected delegates have extremely broad representation and have been supported by the broad masses. The delegates also felt very honored to be elected and expressed their determination not to disappoint the people's hopes and trust and to fulfill the responsibilities of a people's representative. Zhao Ruqin, an agricultural technician from Gongzhuang Township, Eighth District, Ju County, traveled more than thirty li on the day he was elected as a delegate to the County People's Congress to contact voters, collect proposals, and help farmers study methods of planting trees on river banks. People's representatives in Sishui County, while collecting and handling proposals in the Third District, effectively helped the masses solve problems such as selecting and exchanging improved varieties, democratic management in mutual aid and cooperative organizations, and rushing the harvest and planting, promoting the selection of more than 30,000 jin of seeds in the entire district, and all mutual aid and cooperative organizations democratically formulated summer harvest and planting plans. In the process of electing delegates to the County People's Congress in Jining County, due to the full promotion of democracy, the enthusiasm of cadres and the masses for production was increased, 123 mutual aid teams were promptly reorganized throughout the county, and production plans were generally formulated, ensuring the summer harvest and planting.

    山东一百四十个县市选出人民代表大会代表
    山东省一百四十个县、市一级单位人民代表大会的代表已经全部选出。现在全省绝大部分县、市都已召开了第一届第一次人民代表大会会议。
    各县、市首届人民代表大会代表的选举都是按照选举法的规定进行的。各地在选举前，一般都结合中心工作广泛进行了宣传；在选举中切实发扬了民主精神，因此，选出的代表都具有极广泛的代表性，并得到了广大群众的拥护。代表们当选以后，也感到十分光荣，纷纷表示不辜负人民的希望和委托，尽到人民代表的责任。莒县八区宫庄乡农业技术人员赵汝钦当选为县人民代表大会代表后，当天就跑了三十多里路，和选民联系，搜集提案，帮助农民研究在河崖植树的办法。泗水县人民代表在三区搜集和处理提案中，切实帮助群众解决了选换良种、互助合作组织中的民主管理和抢收抢种等问题，推动全区选种三万多斤，所有互助合作组织都民主订出了夏收夏种计划。济宁县在选举县人民代表大会代表过程中，由于充分发扬民主，干部和群众的生产积极性提高了，全县及时整理了一百二十三个互助组，并普遍制订了生产计划，保证了夏收夏种。
