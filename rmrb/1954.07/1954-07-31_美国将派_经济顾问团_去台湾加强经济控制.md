Xinhua News Agency, July 30th: While sending various military personnel to Taiwan to strengthen its military aggression deployment there, the U.S. authorities will also send an "economic advisory group" to strengthen economic control over Taiwan, attempting to turn Taiwan into a permanent base for aggression against China and Asia.

According to Taiwan news, Roger Steffan, economic assistant to Eisenhower, will lead an "economic advisory group" in early August, including experts in so-called economic development, budgeting, taxation, foreign exchange, and accounting, to Taiwan for activities lasting four to nine months. The "economic advisory group" will "study" Taiwan's overall economic situation, help the Chiang Kai-shek gang plan to intensify the exploitation of the Taiwanese people's wealth and the development of natural resources, adapt to the U.S.'s aggressive strategic deployment and the plunder goals of monopoly capital. In order to further sell out Taiwan's interests to its American masters, the Chiang Kai-shek gang recently hastily established a group to collect a large amount of Taiwan's economic data, preparing to provide it to this "economic advisory group" for use.

The U.S. has long taken this aggressive action of turning China's territory of Taiwan into a permanent U.S. military base for aggression. Since the surrender of Japan, with the help of the traitor Chiang Kai-shek, the United States has gradually manipulated Taiwan's economic lifeline, replacing Japan's position in Taiwan.

After Japan's surrender, the United States sent many so-called experts to Taiwan to investigate economic resources and control important enterprises. In November 1946, the Chiang Kai-shek gang and the United States signed the traitorous "Sino-American Treaty of Commerce," granting the United States privileges in Taiwan such as "free operation" of various enterprises and the use of the Keelung and Kaohsiung seaports. In February 1948, the Chiang Kai-shek gang and the United States signed an agreement on the "joint development" of Taiwan, granting privileges for the exploitation of Taiwan's mineral resources. In August of the same year, the United States sent special envoy Wedemeyer to Taiwan to formulate specific plans with the Chiang Kai-shek gang for the United States to control Taiwan's economy. Since then, the forces of U.S. monopoly capital have massively invaded and controlled Taiwan. In June 1952, the Chiang Kai-shek gang signed the so-called "investment guarantee" agreement with the United States, allowing U.S. monopoly capital to remit profits plundered in Taiwan back to the United States without being subject to foreign exchange controls. On July 6th of this year, the Chiang Kai-shek "Legislative Yuan" passed the traitorous "Foreign Investment Regulations," openly abolishing some restrictions on foreign investment that the Chiang Kai-shek had previously formulated to deceive the people, and opening the door for its American masters to carry out more brutal plunder of Taiwan.

Through economic "aid" and private investment to the Chiang Kai-shek gang, the United States has gradually completely controlled Taiwan's industry, mining, and agriculture. The United States has continued to provide the Chiang Kai-shek with a large amount of economic "aid" after it forcibly occupied Taiwan. According to the Chiang Kai-shek gang's news agency, in the four years from July 1950 to June 1954, the United States gave the Chiang Kai-shek economic "aid" totaling 396.8 million U.S. dollars. Under the guise of economic "aid," the United States invested a large amount of funds and materials into various sectors of Taiwan's industry and mining, and sent a large number of so-called "technical personnel" to supervise. U.S. monopoly capital also directly controls Taiwan's important industrial and mining sectors in the form of investment and loans. Westinghouse Electric Corporation, a major U.S. monopoly company, controls Taiwan's main power plants, thereby indirectly controlling other industries that rely on these power plants for electricity. Reynolds Metals Company, the second largest U.S. aluminum monopoly, controls Taiwan's entire aluminum metal industry. Other industries such as fertilizers, oil refining, cement, sugar manufacturing, and camphor have also been controlled by U.S. monopoly capitalists.

In terms of agricultural production, the United States controls the production and distribution of chemical fertilizers, which are indispensable for agricultural production in Taiwan, selling them to farmers at extremely high prices while purchasing farmers' grain and raw materials at extremely low prices, carrying out super-exploitation. The United States forces farmers to plant large amounts of sugarcane and camphor that are most beneficial to it, resulting in the one-sided development of agriculture and strengthening Taiwan's colonial dependence on the United States. The United States also colludes with the Chiang Kai-shek to forcibly occupy a large amount of land to form so-called "cooperative farms," using American machinery and the labor of the Taiwanese people to carry out serf-like production.

Now, the United States is preparing to send an "economic advisory group" to further strengthen its control over Taiwan. This fact shows that the United States has not learned its lesson from the continuous failures it has suffered in China and Asia in recent years. However, the U.S. aggressors also invested a lot in that Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group on the Chinese mainland, and the result is known to everyone. The fate of the U.S. aggressors' bet on Taiwan will be no better.

### 美国将派“经济顾问团”去台湾加强经济控制

    美国将派“经济顾问团”去台湾加强经济控制
    【新华社三十日讯】美国当局在派遣各种军事人员到台湾去加强那里的军事侵略部署的同时，又将派遣“经济顾问团”去加强对台湾的经济控制，企图把台湾变成侵略我国和亚洲的永久性基地。
    据台湾消息透露，艾森豪威尔的经济助手罗杰·斯特芬将在八月上旬率领一个包括所谓经济发展、预算、税收、外汇、会计等方面的专家的“经济顾问团”到台湾去，进行四个月到九个月的活动。“经济顾问团”将“研究”台湾全面的经济情况，帮助蒋匪策划加紧对台湾人民膏脂的压榨及自然资源的开发，适应美国的侵略战略部署和垄断资本的掠夺目的。蒋匪帮为了进一步把台湾的利益出卖给它的美国主子，已在最近急不及待地成立了一个小组，大量搜集台湾的各种经济资料，准备提供给这个“经济顾问团”使用。
    美国采取的这种变我国的领土台湾为美国永久性的侵略军事基地的侵略行动，由来已久。美国自日本投降以来，依靠卖国贼蒋介石的帮助，逐步地操纵了台湾的经济命脉，代替了日本在台湾的地位。
    日本投降后，美国就派遣许多所谓专家到台湾去调查经济资源和控制重要企业。一九四六年十一月，蒋匪帮和美国签订了卖国的“中美商约”，给予了美国在台湾“自由经营”各种企业、使用基隆、高雄海港等特权。一九四八年二月，蒋匪帮和美国又签订了“共同开发”台湾的协定，给予了开采台湾矿产资源的特权。同年八月，美国又派遣特使魏德迈到台湾去，和蒋匪帮制定了美国控制台湾经济的具体方案。从此，美国垄断资本的势力就大规模地侵入并控制了台湾。一九五二年六月，蒋匪帮又和美国签订了所谓“投资保证”的协定，允许美国垄断资本可以不受外汇管制的约束，把在台湾搜刮的利润汇回美国去。今年七月六日，蒋匪“立法院”又通过了卖国的“外国人投资条例”，公开取消蒋匪过去为了欺骗人民而制定的对外国人投资的某些限制，为它的美国主子对台湾进行更残酷的掠夺大开方便之门。
    美国通过对蒋匪帮的经济“援助”和私人投资，逐步地完全控制了台湾的工矿业和农业。美国在它强占台湾以后，继续给予了蒋匪大量的经济
  “援助”。据蒋匪帮通讯社透露，从一九五零年七月到一九五四年六月的四年内，美国给予蒋匪的经济
  “援助”达三亿九千六百八十万美元。美国以经济
  “援助”为名把大量资金和物资投入了台湾工矿业的各个部门，并派遣了大批所谓“技术人员”去进行监督。美国垄断资本还用投资和贷款的形式直接掌握台湾的重要的工矿业部门。美国大独占公司威斯汀豪斯电气公司控制了台湾的主要的发电厂，从而间接地控制了依靠这些发电厂供给电力的其他工业。美国第二铝业独占公司雷诺金属公司掌握了全台湾的铝金属工业。其他如肥料、炼油、水泥、制糖、樟脑等工业也都被控制在美国垄断资本家手里。
    在农业生产方面，美国控制了台湾农业生产中不可缺少的化学肥料的生产和运销，以极高的价格卖给农民，而以极低的价格收购农民的粮食和原料，进行超额剥削。美国迫使农民大量种植对它最有利的甘蔗和樟脑，造成了农业的片面发展，加强了台湾经济对美国的殖民地附属性。美国还勾结蒋匪强占大批土地组成所谓“合作农场”，利用美国的机械和台湾人民的劳动力，进行农奴式的生产。
    现在，美国又准备派遣“经济顾问团”去，进一步加强它对台湾的控制。这一事实表明，美国并没有在它近年来在中国和亚洲接连不断地遭到的失败中领受教训。但是，美国侵略者也曾经在中国大陆上对那个蒋介石卖国集团下过很大本钱，结果是大家都知道的。美国侵略者在台湾下的赌注，其命运也决不会更好。
