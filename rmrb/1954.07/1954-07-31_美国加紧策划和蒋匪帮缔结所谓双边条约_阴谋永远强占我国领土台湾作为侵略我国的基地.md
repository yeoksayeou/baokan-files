Xinhua News Agency, July 30th: The United States authorities are intensifying their plotting to conclude a military-based so-called mutual defense treaty with the Chiang Kai-shek remnants, in order to permanently seize our territory of Taiwan and further turn Taiwan into a long-term base for American aggression against our country.

According to "New York Post" columnist Robert Allen on the 27th, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles and Senator Republican leaders, including the head of the Aid-Chiang Group, Nolan, held a series of secret meetings on the issue of U.S. occupation of Taiwan. Dulles emphasized that the U.S. government is determined to prevent Taiwan from being liberated and returning to the embrace of the motherland. Dulles also indicated that the U.S. government intends to include Taiwan in the U.S.-planned Southeast Asia military aggression bloc, but he believes that, given the opposition of other relevant countries, "the best way" is for the United States to conclude a mutual defense treaty with the Chiang Kai-shek bandits similar to the one concluded with South Korea. After the Southeast Asia group is established, Taiwan will then be included.

News from the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek side said that the so-called mutual defense treaty between the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek bandits is expected to be concluded in September. After the U.S. "Ambassador" to Taiwan, Rankin, recently returns to Taiwan, final consultations on the conclusion of the treaty will be conducted. The news also revealed that this U.S.-Chiang treaty had obtained a "decision in principle" and completed its first draft during the recent third visit to Taiwan by the U.S. war-monger Van Fleet. Rankin brought back the draft treaty this time to consult with the U.S. government.

Chiang Kai-shek's "ambassador" to the United States, Gu Weijun, also publicly told reporters on the 28th after recently returning to Taiwan that the conclusion of the so-called U.S.-Chiang bilateral treaty is only a matter of time.

The U.S. conspiracy to fix the U.S. occupation of Taiwan in the form of a treaty by concluding a so-called U.S.-Chiang bilateral treaty, and to expand the heinous arrangement for aggression against China, is to be permanently hostile to the Chinese people. The Chinese people will never allow American imperialism to use Taiwan's Chiang Kai-shek remnants to occupy our territory as its military base for aggression, in whatever form. If the United States does not abandon its plan and withdraw from our territory, it must be responsible for the serious situation caused thereby and bear the consequences.

    美国加紧策划和蒋匪帮缔结所谓双边条约
    阴谋永远强占我国领土台湾作为侵略我国的基地
    【新华社三十日讯】美国当局正在加紧策划和蒋介石残匪缔结军事性的所谓共同防御条约，以谋永远强占我国领土台湾，并进一步把台湾变为美国侵略我国的长期基地。
    据“纽约邮报”专栏作家罗伯特·艾伦二十七日透露，美国国务卿杜勒斯和援蒋集团头目诺兰等参议院共和党领袖们，就美国侵占台湾问题举行了一系列的秘密会议。杜勒斯着重表示美国政府决心阻止台湾获得解放，重归祖国怀抱。杜勒斯也表示美国政府有把台湾包括进美国策划中的东南亚军事侵略集团的意思，但他认为，鉴于其他有关国家的反对，“最好的办法”是由美国和蒋匪缔结一项类似和南朝鲜缔结的共同防御条约。到东南亚集团成立以后，再把台湾包括进去。
    台湾蒋匪方面传出消息说，美国与蒋匪间的所谓共同防御条约预计要在九月间缔结。当最近回到美国的美国驻台湾“大使”兰金再到台湾后即将进行缔结条约的最后商谈。消息还透露，这项美蒋条约在美国战争贩子范佛里特最近第三次到台湾活动时已获得“原则性的决定”，并完成第一次初稿。兰金这次是带着条约草稿回去和美国政府磋商的。
    蒋匪驻美国“大使”顾维钧最近回台湾后，二十八日也公开对记者说，美蒋所谓双边条约的缔结仅是时间问题。
    美国阴谋通过缔结美蒋所谓双边条约来把美国强占台湾的情况用条约的形式固定下来，并扩大对中国的侵略的罪恶布置，就是要长期与中国人民为敌。中国人民决不容许美帝国主义利用台湾蒋介石残匪占据我国领土作为它的侵略军事基地，不论是以什么形式。美国若不放弃它的计划并撤出我国领土，必须对因此而造成的严重局势负责并承受其后果。
