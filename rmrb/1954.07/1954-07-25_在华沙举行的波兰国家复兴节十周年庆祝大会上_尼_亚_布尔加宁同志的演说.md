Comrades!

On behalf of the Soviet Government and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, on behalf of the Soviet Armed Forces, and on behalf of all the people of the Soviet Union, I extend warm greetings to you, and through you to all the people of Poland, and sincerely congratulate you on the tenth anniversary of the establishment of the Polish People's Republic.

I also extend warm greetings to the working people of the Polish capital, the heroic city of Warsaw. Warsaw was completely destroyed by the fascist occupiers, but it has been rebuilt from ruins and ashes, and is now living a life of fiery labor. This is a vivid example of the creative energy of the Polish people.

Ten years ago, a new page was opened in Polish history, a page marking the national and social liberation of the heroic Polish people.

Ten years ago, on the newly liberated Polish soil, the Polish Committee of National Liberation was established—the first worker-peasant government in Polish history. After its establishment, the committee, as a legitimate temporary organ of power, led the people in their struggle for liberation and for the independence and revival of the Polish state. The historical declaration issued by the Polish Committee of National Liberation on July 22, 1944, served as its program, promoting the creation of a new democratic Poland and declaring a firm alliance and friendship with the Soviet Union as the foundation of its foreign policy.

As everyone knows, due to the Great October Socialist Revolution, which declared the right to national self-determination, even to secession from the mother country, for all nations that had been oppressed by Tsarist autocracy, Poland became an independent nation. The Soviet government recognized Poland's sovereignty, and a decree signed by the great Lenin declared all past treaties regarding the partition of Polish territory invalid.

The October Revolution had a tremendous influence on the development of the Polish revolutionary movement. However, at that time, the Polish working people were unable to seize power for themselves. Landlords and capitalists established a reactionary regime in Poland that deprived the people of their rights and subjected them to poverty. As everyone knows, the Polish ruling clique's anti-people domestic policy and anti-national foreign policy led to Poland's loss of national independence in September 1939 and brought countless disasters to the Polish people. As a result of the German fascist occupation, the survival of the Polish people was threatened.

The freedom-loving Polish people rose up to fight against the Hitlerite aggressors. The Polish Workers' Party led this struggle. It united the working peasants, advanced intellectuals, and all true patriots of the motherland around the working class, establishing a broad democratic anti-fascist national front.

The Polish Workers' Party combined the struggle for the national liberation of the motherland with the struggle for the social liberation of the Polish working people and for the establishment of a people's government. The events of decisive significance during this period were the formation in late 1943 and early 1944 of the Polish people's secret parliament—the People's Representative Council, headed by Comrade Bolesław Bierut, a tested fighter for the cause of the Polish working people and an outstanding leader of the new, independent, democratic Poland. The People's Representative Council established its own armed forces—the People's Army, which united the guerrilla forces. Prior to this, the Polish First Division named after Tadeusz Kościuszko, formed in the Soviet Union on the initiative of the Union of Polish Patriots, already existed and was actively fighting on the front against the Hitlerite bandits. The Union of Polish Patriots, composed of Polish revolutionary emigrants, had requested the Soviet government to allow the establishment of a Polish army on Soviet territory. Because the Soviet people considered it their internationalist duty to assist all peoples under the oppression of German fascism, the Soviet government granted this request of the Polish patriots.

On October 12, 1943, the Polish First Division, then commanded by General Zygmunt Berling, together with the Soviet troops, entered the battle against the German fascist forces near the Lenino settlement west of Smolensk. In this arduous battle, Polish soldiers and officers demonstrated unparalleled bravery and collective heroism. More than 300 soldiers and officers of the Polish First Division received Soviet awards for their military achievements. Some Polish soldiers were awarded the lofty title of Hero of the Soviet Union.

Later, the newly formed Polish units on Soviet territory were organized into the Polish First Army. Later, on the liberated Polish territory, the establishment of the Polish Second Army began.

In the summer of 1944, the victorious advancing Soviet troops entered the border between the Soviet Union and Poland. The Soviet army, together with the Polish troops fighting on the Soviet-German front, crossed the Western Bug River, crossed the Soviet-Polish border, and entered Polish territory, thereby laying the foundation for liberating the fraternal Polish people, who had suffered so much, from German occupation.

In these momentous days, the only determination of the Soviet troops entering Poland was to defeat the German fascist enemy, help the Polish people liberate themselves from the oppression of the aggressors, and rebuild an independent, strong, and democratic Poland.

Equipped with first-class Soviet weapons and mastering the latest tactics, the Polish People's Army fought heroically alongside the Soviet Red Army for the complete liberation of Poland and the complete defeat of the fascist aggressors.

I had the great honor to serve as the representative of the Soviet government on the Polish Committee of National Liberation in its early days.

I had the opportunity to observe the combat operations of the Polish army. The extraordinary bravery of the Polish soldiers and officers in fighting the enemy, inspired by the noble goal of liberating their homeland, showed that they were capable and disciplined soldiers, reliable comrades-in-arms of the Soviet army. Supreme Commander Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin repeatedly pointed out the heroic combat prowess of the Polish army in his orders. Hundreds of Polish soldiers and many Polish units were awarded Soviet medals for their military achievements.

The establishment of the Polish armed forces, their political education and combat were directly led by these well-known figures of people's Poland, such as: Aleksander Zawadzki, Hilary Minc, Jakub Berman, Edward Ochab, Karol Świerczewski, Stanisław Popławski and others.

The Union of Polish Patriots and its outstanding activist, Wanda Wasilewska, played a significant role in organizing the Polish troops.

When discussing the liberation of Poland from the fascist aggressors, one cannot fail to point out the contributions of Marshal Konstantin Rokossovsky, an outstanding son of the Polish people, to this noble cause. Marshal Rokossovsky was then the commander of the First Belorussian Front of the Soviet Army, which was operating on Polish territory. The Polish People's Army units attached to this front fought alongside the Soviet Army against the enemy.

On the battlefield against the common enemy, the friendship between our two peoples was strengthened, and the combat friendship between the Soviet and Polish armies was forged. These glorious traditions of comradely friendship have been preserved to the present peaceful period and serve as a reliable source for strengthening the combat spirit of the Soviet and Polish soldiers. Under the leadership of Marshal Rokossovsky, new command cadres of the Polish army are growing day by day. We believe that these new command cadres will certainly be able to gloriously fulfill the military's duty to the motherland.

Comrades! The birth of the new Poland marks the greatest victory of the Polish working masses and is an event of great international significance; it demonstrates the weakening of the world imperialist system and the strengthening of the democratic camp. All progressive humanity warmly applauds the great victory of the Polish people.

Looking back at the path the Polish people have traveled in the past ten years, it can be said with certainty that the main summary of this glorious decade is the consolidation of Polish independence and sovereignty, the growth of the Polish people's democratic state, and the unprecedented development of the Polish national economy.

The war and the German fascist occupation caused significant losses and destruction to Poland. More than one-third of Poland's national wealth was lost. Many villages and cities, including the Polish capital, were turned into ruins. Approximately six million Polish citizens lost their lives. The people's government at that time—the People's Representative Council and the Polish Committee of National Liberation—faced a difficult and complex task: to restore and reorganize the country's economic life. As you all remember, this task was carried out under conditions of brutal class struggle. Reactionaries and hidden fascists, incited and instigated by foreign countries, desperately tried to sabotage the social and economic measures of the people's government, attempting to rebuild the old system in Poland.

The Polish working people crushed all the plots of the reactionaries, overcame the chaos caused by the war in a very short period, and made a great leap forward in developing the economy. All this was possible because the main means of production had been transferred to the working people. Fundamental social reforms, such as the universal land reform and the nationalization of large and medium-sized industries, transportation, and banks, were implemented throughout the country. As a result of these revolutionary reforms, the bourgeoisie and landlords were deprived of their political and economic dominance, and the Polish people, after healing the wounds of war, rapidly advanced the country's economic development according to plan.

Poland was able to revive so easily and quickly because it had such loyal friends as the Soviet Union and other countries of the democratic camp, and the friendship of the Soviet Union helped the Polish people to merge all Polish territories, including the western territories previously seized by German aggressors, into a unified, independent nation.

We, the Soviet people, and all true friends of the Polish people heartily rejoice in your achievements. Your achievements are so clear and obvious that even those who have no goodwill towards the Polish people cannot ignore them.

All friends of Poland are particularly pleased that Poland has transformed from a backward agricultural country into a powerful industrial country, with its industrial production ranking fifth in Europe, surpassing Italy and almost catching up with France. At the same time, it should be emphasized that Poland has established some industrial sectors that it did not have in the past, and the machine-building industry has achieved particularly great development.

The Second Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party, held in March this year, pointed out that the achievements made in national industrialization make it possible to realize another of the most important tasks facing Poland in the short term—the task of rapidly increasing agricultural production and rapidly increasing the production of consumer goods in order to greatly improve the material welfare of the working people. It is an undeniable fact that Polish agriculture has made tremendous achievements in the past decade. However, the current development of agriculture still lags behind the requirements of the rapid growth of the population and industry. Now, your country has formulated extensive plans to vigorously improve agriculture. This task is a task for the whole people and the whole country, and there is no doubt that, under the leadership of the Polish United Workers' Party headed by the Party Central Committee, the Polish working people will certainly be able to promote the development of agriculture.

With the economic upsurge of people's Poland, Polish culture has also developed. Countless geniuses have emerged among the Polish people, making great contributions to the treasure house of world culture. The names of Copernicus, Mickiewicz, Chopin, and many other outstanding Polish scientific and cultural figures are known throughout the world. The Soviet people have been and are watching the achievements of modern Polish scientists and cultural figures and hope that they will achieve new successes in their work for the happiness of their motherland.

When talking about the achievements of people's democratic Poland, it must be pointed out that these achievements are first and foremost the result of the selfless labor and participation in state management by the Polish people's masses. Bourgeois propagandists are still spreading slanderous remarks, saying that the working people are not capable of leading the country. How stale and foolish is that! The actual situation in the Soviet Union and other countries of the democratic camp has long overturned this bourgeois rumor. Under the socialist system, the people are not only the creators of history, but also the true masters of their own destiny, because they are engaged in creation and work for themselves. This is exactly the case in Poland now. The Polish working class has been freed from the unfreedom and lack of rights it was subjected to during the period of capitalist and landlord Poland, and has become the ruling class, the recognized leading force of the people. The Polish working peasants, who have been forever freed from the heavy oppression of the landlord exploitation system, have formed an alliance with the working class and actively participated in the struggle to strengthen people's democratic Poland. Polish intellectuals have broad possibilities to engage in creative work for the motherland.

The completion of the six-year plan for laying the foundations of socialism and the struggle to consolidate the cause of peace have united all the working people of Poland and constantly strengthened their spiritual and political unity.

The revolutionary, Marxist-Leninist party of the Polish working class is the leading and guiding force of the Polish people in the cause of socialist construction. The Polish workers' movement has a long and glorious revolutionary tradition of fighting for the national and social liberation of the people. And today, on this glorious Polish National Revival Day, on the day when the lofty ideals of people's freedom, for which thousands upon thousands of Polish revolutionaries sacrificed their lives, have been victorious, we cannot help but recall the names of those outstanding fighters who fought for the cause of the working class: Ludwik Waryński, Rosa Luxemburg, Feliks Dzierżyński, Julian Marchlewski, Marceli Nowotko, and Paweł Finder.

Today, on this solemn and joyful day, we have every right to say that the aspirations of the outstanding sons and daughters of the Polish people to build a strong and independent Poland—the people's own mother—have been realized.

The Second Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party demonstrated the party's solidarity and its unity around the great, invincible banner of Marx-Engels-Lenin-Stalin. There is no doubt that the unbreakable unity of the Polish United Workers' Party, the People's Government, and all the Polish people is the source of strength and further achievements of the Polish People's Republic, and this unity will continue to be strengthened in the future.

Comrades! The Polish people, like other peoples, are wholeheartedly concerned about maintaining and consolidating peace. The Polish people, who have experienced the disasters of war, know how to cherish peace. Therefore, they actively participate in the struggle for peace and fully support the peace policies pursued by our camp of peace, democracy, and socialism.

The policy of the ruling groups in the United States and Britain to revive German militarism and establish a military bloc of six European countries led by West German revanchists is a great threat to peace. The Polish people and the people of other European countries recognize the danger of this policy to the freedom and independence of European countries, and they unanimously support the proposals put forward by the Soviet Union on the German question and on concluding an all-European treaty guaranteeing collective security in Europe.

The peaceful policies pursued by the countries of the democratic camp and the vigorous development of the worldwide peace movement have led to some easing of international tensions. The Korean Armistice Agreement was signed last year. Now, the first good results have also been achieved in restoring peace in Indochina. According to recent news, agreements to cease hostilities in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia have been signed. This is a great victory for the forces of peace and a direct result of the struggle for peace waged by the delegations of the Soviet Union, the great People's Republic of China, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam at the Geneva Conference.

The cessation of military operations in Indochina could have been achieved sooner if American diplomacy had not obstructed the work of the Geneva Conference, not engaged in covert sabotage, and not exerted brutal pressure on France and Britain.

Many facts prove that American diplomacy is unwilling to abandon its policy, which is known to all as the "policy of strength." As everyone knows, the United States and Britain held separate talks in Washington not long ago, after which a joint declaration on the policy principles of the United States and Britain was issued. Are there any new principles in these principles aimed at easing international tensions? No. There are still those old, well-known imperialist policy principles, such as rehashing the old American plan to enslave the peoples who have already broken free from the shackles of imperialism under the pretext of "opposing communism." It is surprising that they actually put forward such an absurd argument, saying that they want to "liberate" those so-called "enslaved" peoples.

The absurdity of this kind of suggestion and plan is obvious. The era when imperialists could do whatever they wanted is long gone and will never return. Now, in opposition to the aggressive camp, there are nine hundred million people united in a single front, who have truly and forever broken free from imperialist enslavement, enjoying the joy of a new free life, and they are determined to fight to defend these great achievements, no matter who dares to invade them.

The socialist democratic camp is a camp of peace. The most telling fact to illustrate this is that the Soviet Union and the people's democracies have long and resolutely strived for the prohibition of atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons, believing that the greatest invention of human wisdom—atomic energy—should not be used for war and destructive purposes, but for peaceful construction and for increasing human happiness.

Not long ago, the Soviet government issued a statement saying that the Soviet Union had taken a practical step in applying atomic energy for peaceful purposes, and the world's first industrial atomic power station had begun generating electricity. This event is of particular significance. The Polish "People's Tribune" is right: June 27, 1954 (the date when this power station began generating electricity) will be the beginning of a great industrial and technological revolution, the significance of which is not even possible to imagine now.

But as long as the United States does not abandon the use of atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons, the Soviet Union will, of course, have to possess such weapons in order to avoid being defenseless in the event of an accident.

Comrades! The establishment and consolidation of the socialist camp—a powerful fortress of peace and security for all peoples—is the greatest fruit of victory for the free peoples of all countries. We should cherish this fruit and protect it like the apple of our eye. It is our sacred duty to heighten our vigilance, further strive to consolidate the socialist democratic camp, and further strengthen our friendship.

The strength of our peace camp lies not only in its economic and military strength, but primarily in its unity; the relations between our countries are not built on the basis of one country being subordinate to another, but on the basis of friendship and mutual assistance, on the basis of unity of purpose, and on the basis of recognizing the complete equality of all countries, regardless of size.

People's Poland is a strong link and an inseparable part of the powerful socialist camp, and it has the closest friendly relations with all the countries in this camp. The fraternal friendship established between the Soviet Union and the Polish People's Republic is of extreme importance to both of our countries. As everyone knows, the relationship between Tsarist Russia and old Poland was such that, due to the anti-people policies of the ruling exploiting classes, the two countries were filled with hatred, and even military conflicts occurred, although there were never any contradictions between the working people of the two countries, and there was already a good and close friendship between the advanced people of Poland and Russia at that time. During the period between World War I and World War II, the Soviet government wanted to establish friendly relations with Poland, but the Polish ruling clique, incited by foreign imperialists, pursued a reactionary anti-Soviet policy, preventing the improvement of relations between the Soviet Union and Poland at that time.

During World War II, in the process of the two peoples' joint struggle against their common enemy—German fascism—the mutual relations between the two countries underwent a fundamental transformation. This new relationship was consolidated by the Treaty of Friendship, Mutual Assistance, and Post-War Cooperation between the Soviet Union and Poland signed on April 21, 1945.

Since then, the friendship and cooperation between the Soviet Union and People's Poland have been increasingly consolidated and developed, encompassing all aspects of our two countries' political, economic, and cultural relations. The mutually beneficial trade between the Soviet Union and Poland is constantly growing. For example, the trade volume between our two countries this year will increase eightfold compared to 1945. The import of machinery and industrial equipment from the Soviet Union in the form of long-term credit is of particular importance to Poland.

The economic relations between the Soviet Union and People's Poland are characterized by a common desire to help each other. This kind of relationship between countries clearly embodies the new type of socialist state relations, which is completely opposite to the relations between imperialist countries that attempt to enslave each other.

The Polish people can be confident that the Soviet government will continue to expand economic and cultural cooperation between our two countries and provide friendly assistance to the Polish People's Republic in the cause of safeguarding its independence and security.

It is completely natural that People's Poland constantly consolidates and develops friendly relations with other countries in the socialist camp—the great People's Republic of China, the European people's democracies, and the German Democratic Republic, the fortress of the peaceful forces of the German people. In contrast to the revanchist policies of the Bonn rulers in West Germany, the people's government of the German Democratic Republic is constantly strengthening its friendly relations with Poland on the basis of recognizing the peaceful and friendly border between the two countries along the Oder-Neisse line. The existence of a friendly democratic Germany to the west of Poland is a very important historical fact for the Polish people.

Comrades! You have done tremendous work and achieved great achievements in the past ten years, and in the future, a bright prospect unfolds before you. Poland has abundant natural wealth, and you have all the necessary conditions to use this wealth to benefit the country and the working people: a truly people's government, the people's love of labor and love for the motherland, a solid alliance of the working class and the working peasants, the collective wisdom of the party representing the interests of the working people, developed industry, and the constant brotherly support of your friends—the Soviet Union and the people of other countries in the democratic camp. Today is the glorious National Day of Poland. On behalf of all the people of the Soviet Union, I warmly congratulate the Polish people on achieving further successes in consolidating their people's democratic state, in developing the national economy and improving the welfare of the working people, and in the great cause of building a socialist Poland.

Long live the Polish People's Republic—a strong link in the consolidated camp of peace, democracy, and socialism!

Long live the heroic Polish people who are building a socialist society with confidence!

Long live the glorious Polish army that vigilantly defends the interests of the motherland!

Long live the Polish United Workers' Party—the organizer and inspirer of all the victories of the Polish people!

Long live the eternal and unbreakable friendship between the Soviet and Polish peoples!

### 在华沙举行的波兰国家复兴节十周年庆祝大会上  尼·亚·布尔加宁同志的演说

专栏：

    在华沙举行的波兰国家复兴节十周年庆祝大会上
    尼·亚·布尔加宁同志的演说亲爱的同志们！
    我代表苏联政府和苏联共产党中央委员会，代表苏联武装部队，代表苏联全体人民向你们、并通过你们向波兰全体人民致热烈的敬礼，并衷心地祝贺波兰人民政权建立十周年。
    我并向波兰首都——英雄的华沙的劳动人民热烈地致敬。华沙曾被法西斯占领者毁坏无遗，但它从废墟和灰烬中重建了起来，现在它正过着热火朝天的劳动生活，这就是波兰人民的创造性的精力的鲜明例证。
    十年前，波兰的历史揭开了新的一页，这一页标志着英勇的波兰人民的民族解放和社会解放。
    十年以前，在刚刚解放了的波兰土地上成立了波兰民族解放委员会——波兰人民历史上的第一个工农政府。这个委员会成立后作为合法的临时政权机构，领导人民进行解放斗争，争取波兰国家的独立和复兴。波兰民族解放委员会在一九四四年七月二十二日发表的历史性的宣言就是它的纲领，这个宣言促成了新的民主波兰的创立，并宣布和苏联的牢固联盟和友谊是它的外交政策的基础。
    大家知道，由于伟大的十月社会主义革命宣布了过去一直受沙皇专制压迫的一切民族都有民族自决权，甚至可以脱离母国，波兰成了一个独立的国家。苏联政府承认了波兰的主权，并且由伟大的列宁签署一项法令，宣布过去缔结的关于瓜分波兰领土的一切条约无效。
    十月革命对波兰革命运动的发展产生了巨大的影响。但是当时波兰劳动人民并没有能把政权夺到自己手中。地主和资本家在波兰建立了使人民没有权利和遭受穷困的反动政权。大家知道，波兰统治集团反人民的国内政策和反民族的外交政策曾使波兰在一九三九年九月丧失了民族独立，并为波兰人民带来了数不尽的灾难。德国法西斯占领的结果，使波兰人民的生存遭到了威胁。
    爱好自由的波兰人民曾奋起和希特勒侵略者进行斗争。波兰工人党领导了这一斗争。它把劳动农民、先进知识分子和祖国一切真正的爱国人士团结在工人阶级周围，建立了广泛的民主的反法西斯的全国阵线。
    波兰工人党把争取祖国民族解放的斗争和争取波兰劳动人民社会解放、争取建立人民政权的斗争结合了起来。这个时期中具有决定意义的事件是，在一九四三年底和一九四四年初组成了波兰人民的秘密议会——为波兰劳动人民的事业而斗争的久经考验的战士、新的、独立的民主波兰的卓越领袖波莱斯瓦夫·贝鲁特同志为首的人民代表会议。人民代表会议建立了自己的武装——一支把游击队联合在一起的人民军。在这以前，由于波兰爱国者联盟的倡议而在苏联组成的塔戴乌士·科邱希科波兰第一师就已存在，并在反希特勒匪帮的战线上进行着积极的斗争。由波兰的革命侨民组成的波兰爱国者联盟，当时曾要求苏联政府允许在苏联的领土上建立一支波兰军队。由于苏联人民认为援助一切处在德国法西斯压迫下的人民是自己的国际主义职责，苏联政府满足了波兰爱国者的这一要求。
      一九四三年十月十二日，当时由泽格蒙特·伯林格将军指挥的波兰第一师随同苏军部队一起在斯摩棱斯克以西的列宁诺居民区附近投入了反抗德国法西斯军队的战斗。在这次艰苦的战斗中，波兰士兵和军官表现出了无比高度的英勇善战的精神和集体英雄主义。波兰第一师中有三百多个士兵和军官获得了苏联的战功奖赏。有一些波兰军人荣获了苏联英雄的崇高称号。
    后来，由在苏联领土上新组成的波兰部队编成了波兰第一军。稍后在解放了的波兰领土上，开始建立波兰第二军。
    一九四四年夏天，胜利挺进的苏联军队进入苏联和波兰之间的国境。苏军和在苏德战线上作战的波兰军队一起，跨过了西布格河，越过苏波国境，踏入波兰境内，从而奠定了把饱受灾难的兄弟波兰人民从德国占领下解放出来的基础。
    在这些意义重大的日子里，进入波兰境内的苏军的唯一的决心是击溃德国法西斯敌军，帮助波兰人民从侵略者的压迫下解放出来，并重建一个独立、强盛和民主的波兰。
    装备着头等苏联武器和掌握最新战术的波兰人民军，和苏联红军一起为完全解放波兰和彻底击溃法西斯侵略者而英勇战斗。
    我非常荣幸地能够在波兰民族解放委员会建立
  的初期担任苏联政府在这个委员会里的代表。
    我曾有机会看到波兰军队的作战情况。为解放
  祖国的崇高目标所鼓舞的波兰战士和军官们，在与
  敌人的作战时的非凡英勇，表明了他们是能干的、
  有纪律的军人，是苏联军队可靠的战友。最高统帅
  约瑟夫·维萨里奥诺维奇·斯大林在他的命令中曾不
  止一次地指出波兰军队的英勇善战。数以百计的波
  兰军人和许多波兰部队都荣获了苏联的战功勋章。
      波兰武装力量的建立、它们的政治教育和战斗
  是由人民波兰的这些有名的活动家直接领导的，
  如：亚历山大·萨瓦茨基，希拉里·明兹，雅库布·贝尔曼，爱德华·奥哈布，卡罗尔·斯维尔切夫斯基，斯坦尼斯瓦夫·波布瓦夫斯基和其他等人。
    在组织波兰部队的事情上，波兰爱国者联盟和它的杰出活动家文·勒·华西列夫斯基很有功劳。
    谈到波兰自法西斯侵略者手中解放出来时，不能不指出波兰人民的杰出儿子康斯坦蒂·罗科索夫斯基元帅对这一崇高事业的功绩。罗科索夫斯基元帅当时是在波兰领土上作战的苏军白俄罗斯第一战线的统帅。编在这一战线内的波兰人民军部队和苏 军并肩与敌人作战。
    在反对共同敌人的战场上，加强了我们两国人民之间的友谊，锻炼出了波苏两国军队的战斗友谊。这种光荣的同志友谊的传统一直保存到现在的和平时期，成为加强波苏两国军人的战斗精神的可靠源泉。在罗科索夫斯基元帅的领导下，波兰军队的新的指挥干部日益成长。我们相信，这些新的指挥干部一定可以光荣地完成军人对祖国的职责。
    同志们！新波兰的诞生标志着波兰劳动群众的最伟大的胜利，也是具有巨大国际意义的事件；它证明世界帝国主义体系的削弱和民主阵营的加强。全体进步人类都热烈欢呼波兰人民的伟大胜利。
    回顾一下波兰人民十年来所走过的道路，可以肯定地说，这辉煌的十年的主要总结是：波兰独立和主权的巩固，波兰人民民主国家的壮大及波兰国民经济的空前未有的发展。
    战争和德国法西斯的占领使波兰遭受了重大的损失和破坏。波兰的三分之一以上的民族财富都荡然无存了。许多乡村和城市、包括波兰的首都在内，都变成了废墟。约有六百万波兰公民丧失了生命。当时的人民政权——人民代表会议和波兰民族解放委员会面临着一项困难而复杂的任务：恢复和整顿国家的经济生活。你们都记得，解决这一任务，是在残酷的阶级斗争的情况下进行的。受到外国的鼓动和唆使的反动分子和隐蔽的法西斯分子不顾一切地来破坏人民政权的社会措施和经济措施，力图在波兰重建旧制度。
    波兰的劳动人民粉碎了反动派的一切阴谋，在极短时期内就克服了战争所造成的混乱，并在发展经济方面向前跃进了一大步。这一切所以会成为可能，是因为主要的生产资料都已转归劳动人民所有。在全国实现了根本的社会改革，如普遍的土地改革，大、中型工业及运输业和银行收归国有。由于进行了这些革命的改革，资产阶级和地主被剥夺了政治上和经济上的统治地位，而波兰人民在医治了战争的创伤之后，按照计划把国家的经济发展迅速地向前推进了。
    波兰能够这样容易地迅速复兴，是由于它有苏联和民主阵营的其他国家这样一些忠实朋友和苏联的友谊，帮助了波兰人民把所有的波兰领土、包括过去被德国侵略者夺去的西部领土在内，合并到一个全国统一的独立的国家。
    我们苏联人民和波兰人民的一切真正朋友一起，为你们的成就而衷心欢欣。你们的成就是这样明显昭著，甚至那些对波兰人民绝不怀好意的人们，也不能对你们的成就漠然无视。
    波兰的一切朋友特别感到高兴的是：波兰从一个落后的农业国变为一个强大的工业国，波兰的工业生产量在欧洲占第五位，它超过了意大利，而且几乎赶上法国。同时应当着重指出的是：波兰已经建立了过去所没有的一些工业部门，机器制造工业获得特别大的发展。
    今年三月举行的波兰统一工人党第二次代表大会指出，国家工业化所获得的成就使得有可能在短期内实现波兰面临的另一个最重要的任务——急速提高农业生产和迅速增加消费品产量的任务，以大大提高劳动人民的物质福利。无可争辩的事实是：在过去的十年当中，波兰的农业获得了巨大的成就。但是，目前农业的发展仍然落后于居民和工业的迅速增长的要求。现在，你们国家拟就了大力提高农业的广泛计划。这个任务是一个全民的和全国的任务，毫无疑问，在以党中央委员会为首的波兰统一工人党的领导下，波兰劳动人民一定可以推动农业向前发展。
    随着人民波兰经济的高涨，波兰的文化也发展起来了。波兰人民中曾出现了无数的天才，对世界文化宝库作出了巨大的贡献。像哥白尼、米茨凯维奇、萧邦和其他许多波兰杰出的科学和文化人物的名字是全世界都知道的。苏联人民过去和现在都一直在注视着波兰现代的科学和文化人士的成就，并希望他们在为祖国谋幸福的工作中获得新的成功。
    谈到人民民主波兰的成就时，必须指出，这些成就首先是波兰人民群众忘我劳动和参加国家管理的结果。资产阶级的宣传家们仍然在散布诽谤言论，说劳动人民没有能力领导国家。这是何等陈腐和愚蠢！苏联和民主阵营其他国家的实际情况早已推翻了资产阶级的这种谣言。在社会主义制度下，人民不仅是历史的创造者，并且是自己命运的真正主人，因为他们是在为自己而从事创造和工作。波兰现在的情况就正是如此。波兰的工人阶级摆脱了在资本家和地主的波兰时期所处的不自由和无权利的地位，而成了统治阶级，成了公认的人民的领导力量。永远摆脱了地主剥削制度的沉重压迫的波兰劳动农民，和工人阶级结成了联盟，积极地参加了加强人民民主波兰的斗争。波兰人民知识分子有了广阔的可能性来为祖国从事创造性的工作。
    为完成奠定社会主义基础的六年计划和为巩固和平事业的斗争，团结了波兰的全体劳动人民，并不断加强他们在精神和政治上的团结。
    波兰工人阶级的革命的、马克思列宁主义的政党，是波兰人民在社会主义建设事业中的领导的和指导的力量。波兰的工人运动具有为人民的民族和社会解放而斗争的悠久而光荣的革命传统。而今天，在光荣的波兰国家复兴节，在成千成万波兰革命志士为之捐躯的人民自由的崇高理想获得胜利的日子，我们不禁想起为工人阶级的事业而奋斗的那些卓越战士的名字：鲁德维克·瓦林斯基、罗萨·卢森堡、菲利克斯·捷尔任斯基、乌利安·马赫莱斯夫斯基、马赛尔·诺沃特基和帕维沃·芬德尔。
    今天，在这个隆重的和快乐的日子里，我们完全有权利说，波兰人民的优秀儿女要建立一个强大和独立的波兰——人民的亲生母亲——的宿愿已经实现了。
    波兰统一工人党第二次代表大会表明了党的团结一致以及它团结在伟大的不可战胜的马克思—恩格斯—列宁—斯大林的旗帜的周围。毫无疑问，波兰统一工人党、人民政府和全体波兰人民的牢不可破的团结是波兰人民共和国取得力量和获得进一步成就的泉源，这种团结今后将继续加强。
    同志们！波兰人民和其他各国人民一样，是全心全意地关心着维护和巩固和平的。饱经战争的灾难的波兰人民是知道珍惜和平的。因而他们积极地参加争取和平的斗争，并完全拥护我们和平、民主和社会主义阵营所实行的和平政策。
    美国和英国的统治集团所实行的复活德国军国主义和建立以西德复仇主义者为首的六个欧洲国家的军事集团的政策，是对和平的极大的威胁。波兰人民和欧洲其他一些国家的人民都认识到这一政策对欧洲国家的自由和独立的危害性，他们一致拥护苏联提出的关于德国问题的建议和关于缔结保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约的建议。
    民主阵营各国实行的和平政策和全世界和平运动的蓬勃发展，使国际紧张局势得到某些缓和。朝鲜停战协定去年签订了。现在，在恢复印度支那和平方面也取得了第一批良好的结果。据最近消息，在越南、老挝和柬埔寨停止敌对行动的协定已经签订了。这是和平力量的巨大胜利，是苏联、伟大的中华人民共和国和越南民主共和国代表团在日内瓦会议上进行的争取和平的斗争的直接成果。
    如果美国外交不阻挠日内瓦会议的工作，不在暗中捣鬼，不对法国和英国施加粗暴的压力，那末印度支那军事行动的停止是早就能实现的。
    许多事实证明，美国外交不愿放弃自己的政策，这就是大家所知道的“实力”政策。大家知道，就在不久以前，英美在华盛顿举行了单独会谈，会谈后发表了一项关于美国和英国的政策原则的联合宣言。这些原则里有没有什么新的、目的在于缓和国际紧张局势的东西呢？没有。那里面仍然是那些陈旧的、举世皆知的帝国主义政策原则，譬如，借口“反对共产主义”而重新搬出想奴役那些已经摆脱了帝国主义桎梏的人民的陈旧的美国计划。使人惊奇的是他们居然提出这种荒谬的论调，说什么要“解放”那些所谓“被奴役”的人民。
        这一类建议和计划的荒谬是显然易见的。帝国主义者为所欲为的时代早就过去了，并且永远也不会再回来了。现在和侵略阵营相对立的有结成一条统一战线的九亿人民，他们已经真正永远摆脱了帝国主义奴役，享受着新的自由生活的欢乐，他们具有决心，不论谁敢来侵犯他们的伟大的成果，他们一定为保卫这些成果而战斗。
    社会主义民主阵营是和平阵营。最足以说明这点的事实是：苏联和各人民民主国家早就坚决地努力争取禁止原子武器和氢武器，它们认为人类智慧的最伟大发明——原子能不应用于战争和破坏的目的，而应用于和平建设和增进人类幸福的目的。
    不久前苏联政府曾发表声明说：苏联已在把原子能应用于和平目的方面走了实际的一步，世界第一个原子能工业电力站开始发电。这件事是有着特别意义的。波兰“人民论坛报”说得对：一九五四年六月二十七日（这个电力站开始发电的日期）将是伟大的工业和技术革命的开端，这一革命的意义现在甚至还不可能想像出来。
    但是只要美国一天不放弃使用原子武器和氢武器，苏联当然就不得不握有这种武器，以便在一旦发生意外时不致处于赤手空拳的境地。
    同志们！社会主义阵营——和平和各国人民安全的强大堡垒——的建立和巩固，是各国自由人民的最伟大的胜利果实。我们应当珍惜这一果实，并像保护眼珠一样来保护它。我们的神圣责任是提高警惕，进一步竭力巩固社会主义民主阵营，进一步加强我们的友谊。
    我们和平阵营的力量不仅在于它的经济和军事力量，而且首先在于它的团结；我们各国之间的关系不是建筑在一国屈从于另一国的基础上，而是建筑在友谊和互助的基础上，建筑在目的一致的基础上，建筑在承认不分大小的一切国家完全平等的基础上。
    人民波兰是强大的社会主义阵营的一个坚强的环节和不可分割的部分，它同这一阵营中所有的国家都有着最亲密的友谊关系。在苏联和波兰人民共和国之间建立的兄弟友谊对我们两国都有着极重大的意义。大家知道，沙皇俄国和旧日的波兰的相互关系是怎样的，由于统治的剥削阶级的反人民的政策，两国之间充满了仇恨，甚至于发生军事冲突，虽然两国的劳动人民之间从来没有过任何的矛盾，而且当时波兰和俄国的先进的人士之间已有了很好的、紧密的友谊。在第一次世界大战和第二次世界大战之间的一段时期里，苏联政府曾想同波兰建立友好的关系，但是受到外国帝国主义者怂恿的波兰统治集团实行反动的反苏政策，阻挠了苏联和波兰的关系在当时得到改善。
    在第二次世界大战期间，在两国人民对他们共同的敌人——德国法西斯主义作联合斗争的过程中，两国之间的相互关系才有了根本转变。这种新的关系为一九四五年四月二十一日签订的波苏友好、互助与战后合作条约巩固下来了。
      从那时起，波苏两国之间的友谊和合作日益巩固和发展，包括我们两国政治、经济和文化关系的各个方面。波苏两国之间以互利为基础的贸易不断增长。例如，今年我们两国之间的贸易额将增为一九四五年的八倍。以长期信贷方式从苏联输入机器和工业设备，对于波兰有特别重大的意义。
      苏联和人民波兰的经济关系的特点是互相帮助的共同愿望。这种国与国之间的关系明显体现了新型的社会主义的国家关系，它和企图互相奴役的帝国主义国家之间的关系完全相反。
      波兰人民可以相信，苏联政府将继续扩大我们 两国之间的经济和文化合作，在波兰人民共和国保障自己的独立和安全的事业中，给予它友好的帮助。
      人民波兰不断巩固和发展同社会主义阵营的其他国家——伟大的中华人民共和国、欧洲各人民民主国家、德国人民和平力量的堡垒德意志民主共和国的友好关系，这是完全自然的。和西德波恩统治者的复仇主义政策相反，德意志民主共和国人民政权在承认沿奥得—尼斯河的两国和平友好国界的基础上，不断地加强同波兰的友好关系。波兰的西边有友好的民主德国存在，对波兰人民说来是一个非常重要的历史事实。
    同志们！过去十年中你们进行了巨大的工作，获得了伟大的成就，而在未来，你们面前又展开了一幅光辉的远景。波兰有着丰富的天然财富，你们有着用这些财富来为国家和劳动人民谋幸福的一切必要条件：真正的人民政权，人民的爱好劳动和对祖国的热爱，工人阶级和劳动农民的巩固的联盟，代表劳动人民利益的党的集体智慧，发达的工业，以及你们的朋友——苏联和民主阵营其他各国人民的经常不断的兄弟般的支持。今天是波兰光荣的国庆日，我代表苏联全体人民热烈祝贺波兰人民在巩固自己的人民民主国家中，在发展国民经济和增进劳动人民的福利中，在建设一个社会主义的波兰的伟大事业中获得进一步的成就。
    强大的和平、民主、社会主义阵营的巩固的一环——波兰人民共和国万岁！
    满怀信心地建设着社会主义社会的英雄的波兰人民万岁！
    警觉地保卫着祖国利益的光荣的波兰军队万岁！
    波兰人民一切胜利的组织者和鼓舞者——波兰统一工人党万岁！
    苏波两国人民永恒的、牢不可破的友谊万岁！
