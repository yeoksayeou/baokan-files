Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, July 17th: U.S. Communist Party Chairman William Z. Foster published a commentary on Eisenhower's opposition to People's China entering the United Nations in the New York "Daily Worker" on the 13th. He wrote: "Whether Eisenhower likes it or not, People's China is already a world power. The diplomatic recognition of China by all countries and the United Nations is one of the main conditions for easing international tensions and establishing peace."

Foster pointed out: "The main purpose of the Eisenhower government's opposition to People's China entering the United Nations is to open the door for a large-scale civil war that it is currently trying to instigate in China, in order to use it as part of its strategy to conquer the world."

Foster wrote, when mentioning that China is a world power: "This explains why more and more countries are tending towards the inevitable conclusion: the great, new People's Republic of China must be given the seat in the United Nations that it deserves, which is currently being usurped by the Chiang Kai-shek gang. Although Senator Noland has desperately threatened that if China gets a seat in the United Nations, the United States will withdraw from the United Nations, this trend will not stop because of this threat."

Foster concluded: "The time has come for labor and the broad masses of the American people to participate in this affair and extend a welcoming hand to their friends, the great Chinese people."

Xinhua News Agency, July 16th: The Soviet "Literary Gazette" published an article written by Markov on July 10th, denouncing the clamor of Noland and his ilk who are hostile to the Chinese people. The following is an abstract of the article:

William Noland, the Republican majority leader of the U.S. Senate, is known throughout the world for his infamous title "Senator representing Taiwan." For many years, this senator from California has been representing the Kuomintang bandit gang in Washington. It is justly recognized that he is the "number one spokesman" for a group of pro-Chiang Kai-shek ranters in the U.S. Congress -- the most enthusiastic representative of the notorious "Aid China Lobby," which demands the continued implementation of bankrupt policies such as interfering in the internal affairs of the Chinese people, providing military assistance to the remnants of the Kuomintang bandits in Taiwan, and expanding the war in Indochina. According to the Congressional Record, Noland gave one hundred and three speeches on the issue of aiding Chiang Kai-shek in 1951 alone.

When explaining Noland's "plan," the "New York Times" once pointed out that his plan was to not recognize the People's Republic of China, to not allow the Central People's Government of China to obtain its legitimate status in the United Nations, to not return Taiwan, which belongs to China, to China, and to "not show excessive respect for Mr. Nehru's opinions," that is to say, to ignore Asian public opinion aroused by the U.S. policy of discriminating against People's China. In recent years, many arrogant plans aimed at deepening the tension in the Far East have been proposed by this overbearing senator.

However, the People's Republic of China has gained universal recognition as one of the world's five major powers. The great contribution China has made to the success of the Korean armistice negotiations, the activities of the Chinese delegation in Geneva, and the recent visits of Zhou Enlai, Premier and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, to Delhi and Rangoon – all of this has greatly enhanced the international prestige of the new China. World opinion demands an end to the shameful policy of ignoring the legitimate rights of the Chinese people in the United Nations and harming the cause of peace, and demands the restoration of normal economic relations with China. These demands are so consistent that Noland and other "lobbyists" feel that their position is under serious threat. A group of the most stubborn members of the U.S. Senate demanded that if the United States could not impose its will on other member states of the United Nations this time, and if the majority of the members of the General Assembly voted in favor of the People's Republic of China entering the United Nations, then the United States would withdraw from the United Nations. As usual, "number one spokesman" Noland has exerted the greatest effort. As American newspapers pointed out, the American ruling group has taken into account that these words of the senator will have an impact on those countries that hope that the People's Republic of China will participate in the United Nations.

But the rage of Noland and his ilk is the rage of paper tigers. Noland's clamor, and the recent speeches by Eisenhower and Dulles, prove the intention of the American ruling group to persist in a disruptive policy towards China, which has been met with very strong resentment by British public opinion. The people of all countries know that the role played by the People's Republic of China in modern international affairs is so huge and so important that it is impossible to artificially "exclude" it from life, despite the fact that those American reactionaries who have lost all sense of reality are eager to do so.

    美共主席福斯特斥艾森豪威尔敌视人民中国
    苏联“文学报”发表马尔科夫的文章谴责诺兰之流的叫嚣
    【新华社柏林十七日电】美国共产党主席威廉·兹·福斯特在十三日的纽约“工人日报”上就艾森豪威尔反对人民中国进入联合国一事发表评论。他写道：“不论艾森豪威尔喜欢不喜欢，人民中国已经是一个世界大国了。各国和联合国在外交上承认中国是缓和国际紧张局势和建立和平的主要条件之一。”
    福斯特指出：“艾森豪威尔政府反对人民中国进入联合国的主要目的，就是为它目前正企图在中国发动起来的一场大规模内战敞开门户，以便作为它征服世界的战略的一部分。”
    福斯特在提到中国是一个世界大国时写道：“这说明为什么越来越多的国家正在倾向于这个必然的结论：必须让伟大的、新的中华人民共和国得到它应该得到的目前被蒋介石匪帮所窃据的联合国席位。尽管参议员诺兰已经拼命地威胁说，如果中国在联合国中得到席位的话，美国就退出联合国，但是这种倾向并不因这种威胁而停止。”
    福斯特最后写道：“劳工和广大的美国人民群众参预这件事务并向他们的朋友、伟大的中国人民伸出欢迎的手的时候到来了。”
    【新华社十六日讯】苏联“文学报”七月十日刊载马尔科夫写的一篇文章，斥责诺兰之流敌视中国人民的叫嚣。文章摘要如下：
    美国参议院共和党多数派领袖威廉·诺兰是以他的臭名“代表台湾的参议员”著称于世的。多年来，这个美国加利福尼亚州的参议员在华盛顿一直代表着国民党匪帮。人们很公正地认识到，他是美国国会中一批亲蒋介石的饶舌家的“天字第一号发言人”——臭名远扬的“援华院外活动集团”的最热烈的代表，这批饶舌家要求继续执行干涉中国人民的内政，给台湾国民党残余匪帮以军事援助，扩大印度支那战争等等那种破了产的政策。根据美国国会的会议记录，诺兰在一九五一年一年中就对援助蒋介石问题作了一百零三次的讲演。
    “纽约时报”在说明诺兰“计划”时，曾经指出，他的计划是不承认中华人民共和国，不让中国中央人民政府取得在联合国中的合法地位，不把属于中国的台湾归还中国，“不对尼赫鲁先生的意见表示过分尊重”，这也就是说，不理会因美国歧视人民中国的政策而激起的亚洲舆论。近几年来凡是旨在加深远东紧张局势的许多狂妄计划，没有一个不是这个蛮横的参议员所提出的。
    然而，中华人民共和国作为世界五大国之一已获得了普遍的承认。中国对朝鲜停战谈判的成功所作的巨大贡献、中国代表团在日内瓦的活动、中华人民共和国总理兼外交部部长周恩来不久前对德里和仰光的访问——所有这一切都大大提高了新中国的国际威信。世界舆论要求停止那种无视中国人民在联合国合法权利并使和平事业遭受损失的可耻政策，要求和中国恢复正常经济关系，这些要求是这样地一致，以致诺兰和其他“院外活动者”们都感到自己的立场受到了严重的威胁。美国参议员中一批最顽固的分子要求：如果美国这次不能够把自己的意旨强加在联合国其他会员国的身上，如果大会的大多数会员国都投票赞成中华人民共和国进入联合国，那末美国就退出联合国。正如平日一样，“天字第一号发言人”诺兰也卖了最大的力气。正如美国报纸所指出的，美国统治集团已考虑到，参议员这些话对希望中华人民共和国参加联合国的那些国家，会发生影响。
    可是诺兰之流的狂怒乃是纸老虎的狂怒。诺兰的叫嚣、艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯最近发表的谈话，证明了美国统治集团坚持对中国采取扰乱政策的意向，英国公众舆论就对它们表示非常强烈的反感。各国人民知道，中华人民共和国在现代国际事务中所起作用太巨大和太重要了，以致要想人为地把它“排斥”于生活之外已是不可能的事情，尽管那些丧失了所有现实感的美国反动分子渴望着做到这一点。
