A Common Man's Noble Qualities
    ——Remembering Communist Party Member Geng Changsuo
    Xinhua News Agency reporter Wen Ying

    In appearance, Geng Changsuo is a very ordinary farmer. Like all laboring farmers in their fifties, his face is covered with wrinkles recording his past labor and suffering. And like many farmers now, one can see in his eyes a confidence in a happy future.

    This ordinary man, under the leadership of the Communist Party, was the first to organize an agricultural production cooperative and the first to use a cooperative to prove to the broad masses of farmers that the path of collectivization was the correct path to escape poverty and move towards a happy life. From some ordinary things in Geng Changsuo's work, one can see what noble qualities this Communist Party member possesses.

    When the cooperative was still small, the members discussed building an oil mill to engage in sideline production, but they didn't have the money to buy lumber. At that time, the two rooms Geng Changsuo lived in had collapsed, and he was preparing to rebuild them. He said, "Use my lumber!" The others said, "What will you do for a place to live?" He said, "I'll borrow a house to live in. When the cooperative is rich, it can repay me." The oil mill was built, and it could increase the members' income a lot every year. This is naturally a small matter, but this spirit of selfless devotion is the most important virtue of a Communist Party member. The members liked such a person to lead them. Once, Geng Changsuo went to the Soviet Union to visit. When he returned, he had some living allowance money left over from what the People's Government had given him. He didn't use the money to buy personal items, but bought some pictures, small bowls, pencils, hair clippers, etc., to give to the members and children to use. Everyone said, "Geng Changsuo is always thinking about us!" Everyone's suffering is his own suffering, and everyone's happiness is his own happiness. This is the characteristic of Geng Changsuo's thinking, and it is precisely this thinking that made him determined to run the cooperative for everyone.

    Because he thoroughly understood the thoughts of the laboring farmers, he especially appreciated the correctness of the Party's policies. Not long after the cooperative was established, eight households of farmers requested to withdraw. At that time, the cooperative's public property included lumber and hemp for making rope. The withdrawing households thought the lumber would be difficult to sell, and they all wanted to take hemp out of the cooperative. Some members were very angry, advocating restricting their withdrawal, and some advocated not giving them hemp. Geng Changsuo was naturally very sad to see someone withdraw, but he remembered the Party's "voluntary" policy. He said to the members, "Their withdrawal proves that our cooperative is not running well. If we run it well, they will believe in the benefits of organizing and will come back. If we make things difficult for them, we will close the door." The withdrawing households took away more than a thousand catties of hemp, so Geng Changsuo borrowed money everywhere to buy more, so that the rope-making team would not delay production. In the autumn, after the land yielded grain and the sideline production made money, seven of the eight withdrawing households successively returned to the cooperative.

    Geng Changsuo often introduces his most fundamental experience in running the cooperative to people who come to visit the cooperative: "Listen to the Party's words and follow the right path; resolutely do not take the crooked path." The cooperative had the following two incidents. In 1950, the cooperative had already used the power of organization to increase land yield. The members all had some surplus money. Some members' old-fashioned ideas emerged. They said, "Land is fundamental," and wanted to use the surplus money to buy land. Geng Changsuo and the majority of Party members firmly opposed it. He said to everyone, "The Party lets us organize so that everyone can live a good life. If we become rich and buy land, leaving others poor, that's not right." The members who wanted to use the surplus money to buy land realized their mistake and thought he was right. However, in 1951, when Geng Changsuo and a group of Party members resolutely opposed engaging in speculative trading with unscrupulous merchants, many members did not agree with his approach. At that time, the unscrupulous merchant Li Hengxin wooed the member Li Genli, who was engaged in sideline production, attempting to use the cooperative's name to sell kerosene and peanut oil. After Geng Changsuo discovered this, he sternly refused. Some members were very dissatisfied, saying, "We can earn millions in one transaction. We're not even eating the food that's being delivered to our mouths." Geng Changsuo said, "If the cooperative engages in speculative trading, it's going against the state, and it's going down the crooked path." Soon, the "Five-Anti" movement was launched, and the unscrupulous merchant Li Hengxin was punished by the government. Everyone said, "Thanks to the director's firm stand, otherwise we would have made a mistake."

    Because Geng Changsuo's leadership in running the cooperative produced excellent results, some people often became proud, but Geng Changsuo became even more modest and cautious. He said, "These achievements came from the Party's leadership and the members' labor. The glory belongs to the Party and the members." He never relaxed his studies, often recognizing characters, reading newspapers, and reading documents, sometimes asking others to read them to him. He always hoped to learn from the strengths of others. Last December, when their agricultural production cooperative held its tenth anniversary celebration, he heard that the Cao Tongyi agricultural production cooperative had implemented "contracting work and output to households," so he invited representatives from five large cooperatives attending the meeting to discuss the experience of the Cao Tongyi cooperative in implementing contracting work and output to households. He heard that Liang Jiaduan, a farmer from Chengjiao Village in Shijiazhuang City, had good cotton-growing techniques, so he sent three people to travel hundreds of miles to learn from him.

    People who become arrogant after achieving success feel that the past work is enough and are unwilling to make further progress. Geng Changsuo is not like this. He said:
    "To get to socialism, we still have to shed some more sweat!" He said that at his age, he wouldn't rest until socialism was achieved. In his opinion, socialism is a very clear thing. Socialism is happiness, like the Soviet Union. If the cooperative can increase production by one foot using manual labor, then the collective farm can naturally increase production by ten feet using machines, so nothing can stop him from working for socialism. For a long time, everyone has been complaining that he sleeps too little, attending meetings at night, going to the fields to inspect production during the day, and always thinking about what to do next and how to do it, sleeping only four or five hours a day. But he always says, "I'm not tired or sleepy." Recently, the cadres of the cooperative's management committee sometimes force him to go to sleep; however, before long, he appears in the fields again. Afraid that someone will force him to rest again, he hurriedly says, "I slept, I slept enough." Geng Changsuo joined the Party in 1944 and has been fighting for the happy life of farmers tirelessly for the past ten years.

    一个平常人的高贵品质
    ——记共产党员耿长锁
    新华社记者　文英
    看起来，耿长锁是个很平常的农民，像一切到了五十多岁年纪的劳动农民一样，脸上堆满了记载着过去劳动和苦痛生活的皱纹，也像现在很多农民那样，可以从他的眼睛里看到对未来幸福生活的信心。
    这个平常的人，在共产党领导下最先组织了农业生产合作社，最先用合作社向广大农民证明了合作化道路是摆脱贫困走向幸福生活的正确道路。从耿长锁工作中一些平常的事里，可以看出这个共产党员有着怎样高贵的品质。
    当这个合作社的规模还小的时候，社员们商量盖一所油坊搞副业，但是没钱买木料。当时耿长锁住的两间房子塌了，正准备翻盖，他说：“把我的木头用了吧！”大伙说：“你没住的怎么办？”他说：“我去借房子住，社里富裕了再还我。”油房盖起来了，它年年可以给社员们增加不少收入。这自然是一件小事，但是这种大公无私的精神，是共产党员最重要的美德。社员们喜欢这样的人来领导他们。有一次，耿长锁到苏联去参观，回来时，人民政府发给他的生活补助费剩下了一些，他没有用这些钱买个人用的东西，却买了些图片、小碗、铅笔、理发的推子等，送给社员和孩子们用，大家都说：耿长锁心里老想着大伙哩！大家的苦就是自己的苦，大伙的幸福就是自己的幸福，这是耿长锁思想的特点，也正是这个思想使他决心为大家办社的。
    因为他对劳动农民的心思摸的透，所以也特别体会到党的政策的正确。刚建社不久，有八户农民要求退社，当时社里的公共财产有木头和打绳用的麻，退社户嫌木头不好卖，都愿意带麻出社。有的社员很生气，主张限制他们退社，有的主张不退给他们麻。耿长锁见有人退社自然很难过，可是他记着党指示的“自愿”政策，他向社员们说：“他们退出去，证明咱们的社办的不好，咱办好了，他们就相信组织起来的好处，还会回来的。要是难为了他们，就把门堵上了。”退社户分走了一千多斤麻，耿长锁就到处借钱再买，使打绳组不耽误生产。秋后，地里打了粮食，副业也赚了钱，退社的八户，有七户又陆续回到社里来了。
    耿长锁常向到社里参观的人们介绍他的一条最根本的办社经验：“听党的话，走正道；坚决不要走歪道。”合作社曾发生过这样两回事，一九五零年，合作社已经用组织起来的力量提高了土地产量，社员们都有些余钱，有的社员走老路的思想就产生了，他们说“地是根本”，要用余钱买地。耿长锁和大多数党员坚决反对，他跟大家说：“党让咱们组织起来，是为了大家都过好日子，咱们富裕了就买地，让别人受穷，可不对头。”想用余钱买地的社员觉悟了，认为他说的对。可是，一九五一年当耿长锁和一批党员坚决反对和奸商一起作投机买卖时，很多社员就不赞成他的作法了。当时，奸商李恒信拉拢搞副业的社员李根立，企图用合作社的名义贩卖煤油、捣卖花生。耿长锁发觉后，严厉拒绝了。有些社员很不满意，说：“一趟买卖就赚几百万，送到嘴边的饭都不吃。”耿长锁说：“合作社要干投机买卖，就是跟国家作对，就走到歪道上去了。”不久，“五反”运动开展了，奸商李恒信受到政府处分。大家说：“亏了社长的脚跟站得稳，要不，咱们就犯错误了。”
    因为耿长锁领导办社，作出了很好的成绩，有的人就常常骄傲起来，但耿长锁却更加谦虚谨慎了。他说：“这些成绩是党领导来的，是社员们劳动来的，光荣是党的，是社员们的。”他从不肯放松学习，经常认字、读报、看文件，有时请别人念给他听。别人的长处，他总希望学到。去年十二月，他们农业生产合作社开十周年纪念大会时，他听说曹同义农业生产合作社已实行了“包工包产”，就邀请到会的五个大社的代表座谈了曹同义社实行包工包产的经验。他听说石家庄市城角庄农民梁家端的种棉技术好，就派了三个人跑出几百里地去学习。
    有了成绩就骄傲的人，是觉得过去的工作已经够了，不肯再进步了。耿长锁不是这样，他说：
  “要到社会主义，还得再流把子汗才行哩！”他说过，就他的年纪，不到社会主义是不会歇心的。在他说来，社会主义是很明白的事情，社会主义就是幸福，就是苏联那样。合作社用手工能把生产提高一尺，集体农庄用机器自然就能把生产提高一丈，所以什么东西也挡不住他为社会主义工作。好久以来，大家都怪他睡觉太少，晚上开会，白天下地检查生产，脑子里老想下一步干什么，怎么干，一天才不过睡四、五个钟头的觉。可是他总是说“不累也不困”。最近，社里管理委员会的干部们有时逼着他去睡觉；可是，不一会，他又在地里出现了。他怕有人又逼他去休息，就忙说：“我睡过了，睡够了。”耿长锁从一九四四年入党，到现在十年来，为着农民的幸福生活而斗争，始终是不知疲倦的。
