Comrades Delegates! Distinguished Guests!

    On behalf of the Central People's Government, I extend warm congratulations to the First Congress of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives.

    For more than four years, our country, relying on the strength of state organs and the people of the whole country, has victoriously carried out large-scale struggles such as reforming the land system, resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and restoring the national economy, and has achieved a series of new victories in politics and economics, and has entered the period of large-scale construction of the first Five-Year Plan in 1953.

    Along with the great achievements of our country's various tasks, our cooperative cause, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government and with the active support of the broad masses of the people, has played an extremely important role in the restoration and development of the national economy. Now, the national supply and marketing and consumer cooperatives have developed into a huge mass economic enterprise with 164 million members and have become an important force in the national economy. In recent years, the national supply and marketing cooperatives and consumer cooperatives led by the All-China Federation of Cooperatives have made significant contributions in assisting state-owned enterprises to invigorate the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, stabilize prices, serve agricultural production, assist handicraft production, improve the living standards of the working people, and consolidate the worker-peasant alliance.

    The Central People's Government under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong has always attached great importance to the development of the cooperative cause and the position and role of cooperatives in the entire national economy. The Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference once stipulated that the cooperative economy "is an important component of the entire people's economy. The People's Government should support its development and give it preferential treatment." In order to realize the general task of the state during the transition period, with the advancement of the state's cause and the development of the cooperative economy, based on the actual situation, the draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China more clearly stipulates: "The cooperative economy is a socialist economy of collective ownership by the working masses, or a semi-socialist economy of partial collective ownership by the working masses." It also stipulates that "The state protects the property of cooperatives, encourages, guides and helps the development of the cooperative economy, and takes the development of production cooperatives as the main road to transform individual agriculture and individual handicraft industry." In the future, after the Constitution is adopted and implemented by the National People's Congress, our socialist construction cause will continue to achieve greater victories, and the cooperative economy will have greater development in the general task of the state gradually realizing socialist industrialization and gradually completing the transition to the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicraft industry, and capitalist industry and commerce, and will play a greater role in the national economy.

    Comrades! At a time when we are victoriously realizing the construction tasks of the second year of the state's first Five-Year Plan, the convening of the First National Congress of Cooperatives is of great historical significance. We are fully confident that in completing the general task of the state during the transition period, all cooperative cadres will be able to, as in the past, further develop their infinite loyalty to the state and to the people's cause, lead all members to better complete the arduous and glorious tasks of the cooperative, and I believe that comrades will continue to achieve new victories and new progress in their glorious cause. I wish the congress a complete success.

    中央人民政府代表
    林伯渠向中华全国合作社第一次代表大会的祝词各位代表们！来宾们！
    我代表中央人民政府向中华全国合作社第一次代表大会致热烈的祝贺。
    四年多以来，我们的国家依靠国家机关和全国人民的力量，胜利地进行了改革土地制度、抗美援朝、镇压反革命分子、恢复国民经济等大规模的斗争，在政治上和经济上取得了一系列的新的胜利，并在一九五三年进入大规模的第一个五年计划的建设时期。
    随着我们国家各项工作的伟大成就，我们的合作社事业，在中国共产党和中央人民政府领导下和在广大人民的积极拥护下，对于国民经济的恢复和发展起了极为重要的作用。现在，全国供销、消费合作社，已经发展成为一个有一亿六千四百万社员的巨大的群众性的经济事业，在国民经济中已经成为一个重要的力量。几年来，中华全国合作社所领导的全国供销合作社、消费合作社在协助国营企业活跃城乡物资交流，稳定物价，服务农业生产，辅助手工业生产，改善劳动人民生活，巩固工农联盟等方面是有重大贡献的。
    在中国共产党和毛泽东主席领导下的中央人民政府，从来就很是重视合作社事业的发展，很是重视合作社在整个国民经济中的地位和作用。中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领曾经规定：合作社经济“为整个人民经济的一个重要组成部分。人民政府应扶助其发展，并给以优待。”为了实现国家在过渡时期的总任务，随着国家事业的前进和合作社经济的发展，依据实际情况，在中华人民共和国宪法草案中更明确的规定：“合作社经济是劳动群众集体所有制的社会主义经济，或者是劳动群众部分集体所有制的半社会主义经济。”并规定了：“国家保护合作社的财产，鼓励、指导和帮助合作社经济的发展，并且以发展生产合作为改造个体农业和个体手工业的主要道路。”将来宪法经全国人民代表大会通过和实施以后，我国社会主义建设事业，必将继续不断地取得更伟大的胜利，合作社经济在国家逐步实现社会主义工业化和逐步完成对农业、手工业和对资本主义工商业社会主义改造的过渡时期的总任务中，将有更大的发展，将会更大地发挥它在国民经济中的重要作用。
    同志们！在我们正在胜利实现国家第一个五年计划第二年度的建设任务的时候，全国合作社第一次代表大会的召开，是有很大历史意义的。我们完全相信，在完成国家过渡时期的总任务中，全体合作社干部一定能够同过去一样，更加发扬自己对国家和对人民事业的无限忠诚，领导全体社员，更好地完成合作社的繁重而光荣的任务，我相信同志们在自己的光荣事业中不断地获得新的胜利和新的进步。敬祝大会的胜利。
