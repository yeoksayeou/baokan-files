The armistice and restoration of peace in Indochina, a matter of close concern to people all over the world, was agreed upon on July 21. Following the Korean armistice, the eight-year-long bloody war in Indochina came to an end. The peace in Indochina, yearned for by the world, has begun to be realized. We warmly welcome this encouraging news.

The Geneva Conference agreement on Indochina is a victory for peace forces, a victory for the people against the colonial system, and a victory for resolving international disputes through peaceful consultation. The achievement of this agreement once again demonstrates to the world that: the war policy of US imperialism has suffered a heavy blow, the desire of people all over the world for peace and against war has converged into a huge torrent, the forces of peace cannot be stopped, and more and more countries in the world agree to peaceful coexistence. As long as the forces of peace unite, the war conspiracies of US imperialism can be completely defeated, and peace in Asia and the world can be promoted and consolidated. It also proves that the people determined to fight for independence and freedom cannot be conquered, and the era in which imperialism attempts to continue maintaining its criminal colonial rule will never return.

In this Geneva Conference, the United States, on the one hand, unreasonably interrupted the talks on the Korean issue, so that the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, which is of concern to the world, did not reach any agreement; on the other hand, it created various obstacles to undermine the peaceful resolution of the Indochina issue. Recently, it has stepped up its collusion with the Chiang Kai-shek gang, attempting to use the Chiang Kai-shek gang and Taiwan to further carry out aggression and sabotage against New China. We, together with the entire Chinese people, firmly oppose these activities of the United States, and strive to thoroughly implement the agreement on Indochina, peacefully resolve the Korean issue, and crush the US's sinister conspiracy to use the Chiang Kai-shek gang.

We express our warm praise and support for the efforts and brilliant achievements made by our delegation headed by Premier Zhou Enlai at the Geneva Conference in line with our government's consistent peaceful foreign policy. The major achievements of the People's Republic of China since its founding and its great contributions to international issues as one of the world's major powers vividly illustrate that all major international issues cannot be resolved without the participation of the People's Republic of China; anyone who tries to obliterate the legitimate status and legitimate interests of the People's Republic of China in international affairs will surely be battered and bruised.

    九三学社主席许德珩的谈话
    全世界人民密切关心的印度支那停战和恢复和平问题，已于七月二十一日达成了协议，继朝鲜停战之后，历时八年的印度支那的流血战争宣告结束了。举世渴望的印度支那的和平开始实现了。我们热烈欢迎这一令人鼓舞的消息。
    日内瓦会议关于印度支那问题的协议，是和平力量的胜利，是人民反对殖民制度的胜利，是以和平协商方式解决国际争端的胜利。这个协议的达成，再一次向全世界表明了：美帝国主义的战争政策遭到了沉重的打击，全世界人民要求和平反对战争的愿望已汇成一个巨大的洪流，和平力量是阻挡不住的，世界上赞成和平共处的国家越来越多，只要和平力量团结起来，美帝国主义的战争阴谋是完全可以战胜的，亚洲及世界和平是可以促进和巩固的。同时也证明了决心争取独立与自由的人民是不能征服的，帝国主义妄想继续维持其罪恶的殖民统治的时代将一去不复返了。
    在这次日内瓦会议中，美国一方面横蛮无理地中断关于朝鲜问题的会谈，使举世关心的和平解决朝鲜问题，没有达成任何协议；一方面制造种种障碍来破坏印度支那问题的和平解决。最近更加紧与蒋匪帮勾结，企图利用蒋匪帮和台湾来进一步施展对新中国的侵略和破坏。我们和全中国人民一道，坚决反对美国这些活动，为彻底实施印度支那问题的协议、和平解决朝鲜问题和粉碎美国利用蒋匪帮的罪恶阴谋而奋斗。
    我们对于以周恩来总理为首的我国代表团本着我国政府一贯的和平外交政策在日内瓦会议中的努力和辉煌成就，表示热烈的赞扬和拥护。中华人民共和国成立以来的重大成就和它以世界大国之一的身份对国际问题作出的巨大贡献，都生动地说明了一切重大的国际问题没有中华人民共和国的参加，是不可能解决的；任何人要抹煞中华人民共和国在国际事务中的合法地位和合法利益，是一定要碰得头破血流的。
