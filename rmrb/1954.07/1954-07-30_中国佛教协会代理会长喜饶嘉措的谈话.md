The agreement reached on the Indochina issue demonstrates that any international dispute can be resolved through peaceful negotiation. This is a victory for the principle of peaceful coexistence. This victory not only restores and guarantees peace in Indochina, but also has significant implications for easing international tensions and consolidating peace and security in Asia and the world. We Buddhists are peace-loving, and like the people of the whole country, we are very happy about the successful outcome of the Geneva Conference.

Our delegation, in line with our government's consistent peaceful diplomatic policy and the strong will of our people to strive for peace, has worked tirelessly throughout the Geneva Conference and made important contributions to the achievement of the agreement. Our country's status as one of the world's major powers has been universally recognized, which has greatly enhanced our country's international prestige. We wholeheartedly endorse Premier Zhou's speech at the final session of the Geneva Conference, and express our highest respect and gratitude for the achievements of our delegation's efforts.

Due to the obstruction of the United States, the Geneva Conference did not reach an agreement on the Korean issue. However, the Korean issue has not been removed from the agenda, and the agreement reached on the Indochina issue brings new hope for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. Although the war and power policies of the U.S. imperialist warmongers have suffered a serious defeat at the Geneva Conference, the U.S. imperialists will not be reconciled. We must be vigilant against all kinds of conspiracies and sabotage by the U.S. warmongers.

We Buddhists must enhance our patriotic ideology, strengthen unity, and work together with the people of all ethnic groups in the country to continue to strive for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and to liberate our territory of Taiwan. We are willing to work with peace-loving Buddhists in Asia and around the world to strive for the thorough implementation of the Indochina agreement and to consolidate world peace.

    中国佛教协会代理会长喜饶嘉措的谈话
    印度支那问题达成协议，说明了国际上的任何争端都可以用和平协商的方式来解决，这是和平共处的原则的胜利。这一胜利不仅恢复和保障了印度支那的和平，而且对缓和国际紧张局势，巩固亚洲及世界和平和安全，有着重大的意义。我们佛教徒是爱好和平的，我们和全国人民一样，为日内瓦会议的胜利成功，感到万分高兴。
    我国代表团本着我国政府一贯的和平外交政策和我国人民争取和平的坚强意志，在日内瓦会议上自始至终，努力不懈，为会议达成协议作了重要的贡献。我国作为世界大国之一的地位已为举世所公认，从而大大地提高了我国国际威望。我们衷心地拥护周总理在日内瓦会议最后一次会上的讲话，并对我国代表团的努力的成就，表示崇高的敬意和感谢。
    日内瓦会议在朝鲜问题上，由于美国的破坏，没有达成协议。但朝鲜问题并没有从议程上去掉，印度支那问题达成协议给朝鲜问题的和平解决带来了新的希望。美帝国主义好战分子的战争和实力政策，在日内瓦会议上虽然遭到了严重失败，但美帝国主义者是不会甘心的。我们必须警惕美国好战分子的各种阴谋和破坏。
    我们佛教徒要提高爱国主义思想，加强团结，和全国各族人民一起，为争取朝鲜问题的和平解决而继续努力，为解放我国领土台湾而奋斗。我们愿和亚洲及世界各国爱好和平的佛教徒在一起，为争取印度支那问题协议的彻底实现，为巩固世界和平而奋斗。（新华社）
