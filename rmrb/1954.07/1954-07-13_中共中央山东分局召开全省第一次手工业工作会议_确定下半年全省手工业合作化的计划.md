    The CPC Central Committee Shandong Bureau Convenes First Provincial Handicraft Work Conference
    Determines Handicraft Cooperativization Plan for Second Half of Year
    The Shandong Branch of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China convened the first provincial handicraft work conference from June 21st to July 3rd. The conference summarized the achievements of Shandong Province in developing handicraft cooperative organizations in recent years and formulated a plan for the province's handicraft cooperativization in the second half of this year.
    According to preliminary investigations, there are more than 1,187,000 people engaged in handicrafts in Shandong Province, and the total annual output value last year accounted for slightly more than 8% of the province's total annual industrial and agricultural output value. Shandong Province began developing handicraft cooperative organizations in 1948. Since the promotion of the general line in rural areas last winter, the handicraft cooperative movement has greatly developed. By June of this year, the province had organized 731 handicraft production cooperatives, 46 supply and marketing production cooperatives, and 2,731 production teams, with more than 72,900 members. More than half of the members were developed in the first half of this year.
    The thousands of products produced by handicraft cooperative organizations in Shandong are mainly sold to rural areas. The handicraft cooperative organizations in eight cities, including Jinan, Qingdao, Yantai, Weifang, Jining, and Zibo, recently signed production and sales contracts with the Shandong Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative for a total value of more than 230 billion yuan in handicraft products to be supplied to rural areas.
    The conference determined that in the second half of this year, while consolidating and improving existing handicraft cooperative organizations, it plans to organize more than 470 handicraft production cooperatives, 164 supply and marketing production cooperatives, and more than 3,000 production teams, newly developing more than 53,000 members. In areas where handicraft cooperation is relatively developed, the main focus will be on developing handicraft production cooperatives where conditions permit. In areas where handicraft cooperation is in the initial stages of development or has not yet been organized, the focus will be on piloting handicraft production cooperatives, vigorously developing production teams where conditions permit, and initially establishing supply and marketing production cooperatives. In areas where handicraft cooperation has developed rapidly but has not yet been reorganized and consolidated, the main task is to consolidate and improve existing cooperatives and teams, and appropriately develop them.

    中共中央山东分局召开全省第一次手工业工作会议
    确定下半年全省手工业合作化的计划
    中国共产党中央委员会山东分局在六月二十一日到七月三日召开了全省第一次手工业工作会议，总结了山东省近几年来发展手工业合作组织的成就，作出了今年下半年全省手工业合作化的计划。
    山东省手工业从业人员据初步调查有一百一十八万七千多人，去年年产总值约占全省工农业年产总值百分之八强。山东省一九四八年就已开始发展手工业合作组织，自去年冬天在农村宣传总路线后，手工业合作运动有了很大发展，到今年六月，全省已组织了七百三十一个手工业生产合作社、四十六个供销生产社和二千七百三十一个生产小组，拥有社员、组员七万二千九百多人，其中半数以上的社员和组员是今年上半年发展的。
    山东各地手工业合作组织出产的上千种产品，主要销往农村。济南、青岛、烟台、潍坊、济宁、淄博等八个城市的手工业合作组织，最近和山东省供销合作总社订的产销合同，供应农村的手工业品总值就有二千三百多亿元。
    会议确定今年下半年在巩固和提高现有的手工业合作组织的同时，计划组织四百七十多个手工业生产合作社、一百六十四个供销生产社和三千多个生产小组，新发展社员、组员五万三千多人。在手工业合作组织相当发展的地区，主要是有条件的发展手工业生产合作社；手工业合作初步发展或尚未进行组织的地区，重点是试办手工业生产合作社，有条件的大量发展生产小组，初步建立供销生产社；在手工业合作发展较快，但尚未进行整理巩固的地区，主要是巩固和提高现有的社、组，并适当地发展。（新华社）
