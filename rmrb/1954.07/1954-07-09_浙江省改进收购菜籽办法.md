Xinhua News Agency:

    In Zhejiang Province, supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions have mostly adopted methods of designated area acquisition, dividing into townships and villages, arranging sequences, organizing farmers to sell collectively in rotation, and simultaneously selling and clearing contracts, which has produced good results. After the Xiaoshun Township Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Jinhua County adopted this method, the amount of rapeseed sold by the five villages that sold in rotation on the first day was equal to the sales figures of the other thirty-plus villages. Currently, the China Oils and Fats Company Zhejiang Provincial Company is entrusting these new rapeseeds to more than 1,000 public and private oil mills throughout the province for processing.

    浙江省改进收购菜籽办法
    浙江省各地供销合作社在收购菜籽中，大都采取划片收购，分乡分村，排好次序，组织农民轮流集体出售，和一面出售，一面清理合同的办法，效果很好。金华县孝顺乡供销合作社采取这个办法以后，第一天轮售的五个村出售菜籽的数量，就等于其他三十多个村的出售数字。目前中国油脂公司浙江省公司正把这批新菜籽委托给全省一千多家公私营油厂加工。　（新华社）
