    The Soviet Union is a Great Naval Power
    Soviet Admiral G.I. Levchenko
    This year, we celebrate the traditional holiday - Navy Day - amidst the further prosperity of our socialist motherland.

    The Soviet people, led by the beloved Communist Party, are selflessly working to realize the historic resolutions of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the resolutions of the September Plenary Session and the February-March Plenary Session of the Central Committee.

    The workers of the Soviet state, with extreme joy and elation, welcomed the resolution of the June Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee this year, which summarized the spring sowing work and crop field management work this year, and the resolution on preparing for the harvest and ensuring the completion of the 1954 agricultural product procurement plan. This resolution once again demonstrated the Communist Party's keen attention to the sharp rise in all sectors of agriculture, to further strengthening the power of the Soviet motherland, and to continuously improving the welfare of the workers.

    The Soviet people, engaged in peaceful and creative labor, always remember Lenin's instructions: we must always be vigilant and protect the armed forces like the apple of our eye, and consolidate our national defense.

    Comrade Malenkov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, said at the first session of the Fourth Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union: "The Soviet Armed Forces now and in the future have all the necessary conditions to fulfill their lofty mission - to defend the motherland and to be ready to give a crushing blow to the aggressors who dare to disrupt the peaceful labor of our people."

    The Navy occupies a very important position in the Soviet armed forces system. The Soviet Navy, which is constantly concerned by the Party and the people, vigilantly and reliably protects the coastline and protects the national interests of the socialist power.

    The Soviet Union is not only the largest land power in the world, but also a great maritime power. The Soviet Union's coastline is more than 47,000 kilometers long, accounting for more than two-thirds of the total length of the Soviet Union's border. The Soviet state borders fourteen seas and is directly connected to the three major oceans: the Atlantic, the Pacific, and the Arctic. Through these oceans, the Soviet Union conducts economic and cultural exchanges with many countries.

    Russians have long been brave navigators and daring, ingenious explorers. They have made great contributions to the study of the world's oceans. The brilliant achievements of Dezhnev, Chirikov, the Laptev brothers, Chelyuskin, Lazarev, Litke, Makarov, Sedov and many Soviet Arctic explorers have been forever recorded in geographical science.

    The purpose of Russian sailors' scientific exploration and discovery has always been different from that of the naval officers of capitalist countries, whose intention is to plunder colonies, enslave weak nations, and rarely care about enriching science.

    The honor of discovering the northeast corner of Asia, the strait between Asia and America, the northwest coast of America, the sixth largest continent in the world - Antarctica - and many islands in the Arctic and Pacific Oceans belongs to the Russians. Five hundred and sixty-four geographical names of oceans, straits, and islands discovered by Russians have been listed on nautical charts.

    Under the Soviet regime, scientific exploration has acquired a particularly large scale. In the period after the October Revolution, the Soviet state conducted twenty-five major explorations, which played a major role in mastering the Soviet sea routes and also made great contributions to science. From 1924 to 1940 alone, the Soviet Union organized ten large-scale marine explorations, while the United States conducted only three explorations in total during these years, and Britain only one.

    This truly scientific purpose of exploration is completely different from that of modern capitalist countries. For example, all the "research" work carried out by the United States in the Arctic region, including in northern Greenland, floating ice islands in the central Arctic region, etc., is subject to its strategic plans.

    Our ancestors often had to engage in bloody battles with those enemies who attempted to push Russia from the coast of the sea into the depths of forests and grasslands. In these battles, Russian sailors added immortal glory to their battle flags. The heroic feats of the Kronstadt sailors, the first great victory won by the young Russian Navy at Hango in 1714, and the heroic defense battles in Sevastopol, Petropavlovsk, Kamchatka Peninsula and other places will forever remain in the memory of the Soviet people.

    The selfless heroism shown by Russian sailors and soldiers in defending their motherland in the face of formidable enemies amazed the whole world. Leo Tolstoy wrote when describing the defenders of Sevastopol: "The epic of Sevastopol will be immortal in Russia, and the hero of the epic is the Russian people..."

    As early as the age of sailing ships, Russian sailors had fought more than twenty major battles with the enemy and completely defeated the enemy. The Russian Navy cultivated outstanding creators and organizers of victories at sea, advanced naval commanders - such as patriotic heroes Ushakov, Senyavin, Lazarev, Nakhimov and others.

    From among the Russian naval servicemen, there emerged not only many world-renowned travelers, discoverers of oceans and islands, fearless sailors and officers, and heroes of sea battles, but also many talented and insightful inventors, innovators, and scientists.

    Nikonov, Bubnov, Titov, Naletov, Makarov, and the Hero of Socialist Labor, Academician Krylov, promoted our motherland's shipbuilding industry and brought it to the forefront in the world. Armored cruisers, fast torpedo boats, submarines, torpedo boats, mine weapons, shipbuilding electrical technology, and many other of the most important combat and technical tools of the navy were initially designed and manufactured in our country, and only later were they plagiarized by foreign countries.

    Russian naval officer Mozhaisky was the first in the world to design and experiment with airplanes. Not long ago, to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the founding of the naval fortress Kronstadt, the city of Russian sailors—Kronstadt—was awarded the Order of the Red Banner. Our great predecessor, Popov, the inventor of radio and radio direction finding, invented radio and radio direction finding here.

    In the years of Soviet power, the navy of our motherland has achieved true development. The Communist Party and the great Lenin considered the work of the army and navy to be of great significance in organizing the Russian people to fight for the victory of the socialist revolution. On February 12, 1918, Lenin signed the order to establish the Red Navy.

    The Communist Party promoted and trained outstanding organizers and leaders of the revolutionary struggle from among the naval servicemen, such as Uliantsev, Sladkov, Malkin, Pozhilov, and Zheleznyakov.

    The naval servicemen led by the Communist Party actively participated in the Great October Socialist Revolution and in the struggle to overthrow the regime of landlords and capitalists.

    The young army and navy grew up and were tempered in fierce battles with countless enemies of the Soviet motherland. The Party sent the Navy to the most important fronts. The Soviet fleet successfully repelled the foreign armed interventionists and White Guards incited by American imperialism on the Volga River, the Kama River, the Northern Dvina River, the Western Dvina River, the Don River, the Dnieper River, the Amur River, Lake Ania and Lake Chiduo. More than 60,000 naval servicemen participated in the ranks of the Red Army, cavalry, and armored trains to fight.

    Tempered in the great revolutionary battles, the naval servicemen who were infinitely loyal to their socialist motherland gloriously completed all the tasks given by the Communist Party and the Soviet government.

    The Soviet people, embarking on peaceful construction, paid great attention to consolidating the defense capabilities of their country and strengthening their armed forces. Restoring and developing the navy was of particular significance.

    In March 1921, the Tenth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union adopted a special resolution on naval issues, which stipulated that it was necessary to ensure the rapid restoration and consolidation of the Red Navy.

    In 1922, the Lenin Communist Youth League assumed the obligation to help the navy. The Youth League sent its outstanding children to work in the fleet and the navy, and to study in naval schools.

    Thanks to the efforts of the entire Soviet people, warships were successfully restored and began to sail. In 1924-1925, the Soviet warships "Aurora," "Komsomolets," "Volovsky," "Proletarian," and others held the first few voyages.

    The socialist industrialization and agricultural collectivization of the country provided a strong economic foundation for the further development and consolidation of the army and navy. Due to the completion of the first five-year plan, there were modernized battleships, strengthened submarines, consolidated coastal defense, and greatly developed the shipbuilding industry. This made it possible to establish the Pacific Fleet in 1932 and the Northern Fleet in 1933.

    The navy obtained many professionally proficient and patriotic naval cadres, who were trained in accordance with the requirements of Soviet military science and the needs of modern warfare characteristics.

    The Soviet naval servicemen, cultivated by the Communist Party, fought bravely for the honor and independence of their motherland during the Great Patriotic War. They demonstrated collective heroism, unprecedented fortitude, bravery, and boldness in fighting against German fascists and Japanese imperialists. The soldiers of the army and navy completed their historical mission, lived up to the love and trust of their people, and lived up to the lofty expectations of all progressive humanity.

    The Soviet people gave a high evaluation of the naval feats and heroic achievements of the navy. Many warships, fleets, and regiments were awarded Soviet orders, and dozens of warships were renamed as Guards. Five hundred and thirteen naval soldiers, sergeants, and officers were awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union, and seven naval servicemen were twice awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union. More than 350,000 naval servicemen were awarded medals and orders.

    The Communist Party and the Soviet government constantly cared about strengthening our country's armed forces, the reliable defenders of the peace and creative labor achieved by the Soviet people. Socialist industry equips the army, navy, and air force with modern, powerful weapons, complex machines, and the most accurate instruments. After the war, the navy was replenished with new warships.

    The naval servicemen deeply felt the constant concern of the Communist Party and the Soviet government for themselves, and are tirelessly improving their military and political knowledge, mastering modern combat technology and new weapons, and strengthening the discipline and organization in their ranks.

    The entire crew of the cruiser "Sverdlov" which sailed to England in June 1953, demonstrated a brilliant example of being well-trained in navigation, having skilled navigation techniques and a high degree of discipline.

    Last year, Soviet warships visited people's democratic countries for friendly visits. This year, the cruiser "Admiral Nakhimov" and many other warships of the Black Sea Fleet also visited the People's Republic of Albania. The meeting between the envoys of the Soviet state - our glorious Black Sea Fleet - and the Albanian working people was a powerful demonstration of the unbreakable friendship between the people of the Soviet Union and Albania.

    This year, Soviet warships are preparing to make several voyages to foreign countries, and naval servicemen are carefully preparing to welcome the upcoming voyages.

    The Soviet people are proud of their armed forces, and they enthusiastically support their army and navy. The participation of tens of thousands of Soviet people in the activities of the Soviet Army, Navy, and Air Force Assistance Association is a vivid manifestation of the people's boundless love and patriotic concern for the Soviet Army and Navy. While studying army and air force operations, members of the Army, Navy, and Air Force Assistance Association are also tenaciously studying various naval professional skills.

    The Soviet naval personnel, together with the soldiers of the army and air force, are devoting their strength and perseverance to further strengthening the defense power of the socialist motherland - the bastion of peace and security for all ethnic groups.

    Faithful to their vocation, the naval soldiers will continue to serve the Soviet people faithfully and enthusiastically, reliably guarding the sea defenses, and protecting the national interests of the great Soviet motherland.

    苏联是伟大的海军强国
    苏联海军上将  戈·依·列夫琴科
    今年在社会主义祖国进一步繁荣的情况下，来庆祝这个传统的节日——海军节。
    由亲爱的共产党领导的苏联人民，正在为实现苏联共产党第十九次代表大会的历史性决议、党中央委员会九月全会和二—三月全会的决议，而忘我地劳动着。
    苏维埃国家的劳动者，以极其愉快的心情，欢欣鼓舞地迎接了苏共中央委员会今年六月全会的决议，即关于今年的春播工作、作物田间管理工作的总结，以及关于准备收获和保证完成一九五四年农产品的收购计划的决议。在这个决议中，再一次表现出了共产党对农业一切部门的急剧高涨、对进一步加强苏维埃祖国的威力以及提高劳动者福利的不断关怀。
    从事着和平的创造性劳动的苏联人民，永远铭记着列宁的指示：必须经常保持警惕，像保护眼珠一样来保护武装力量，巩固国防力量。
    苏联部长会议主席马林科夫同志在苏联第四届最高苏维埃第一次会议上说道：“苏联武装部队现在和将来都有一切必要的条件来完成他们的崇高使命——保卫国防和随时准备给予胆敢破坏我国人民的和平劳动的侵略者以粉碎性的回击。”
    海军在苏联武装力量体系中占着很重要的地位。为党和人民经常关注的苏联海军，警惕地、可靠地保卫着海岸线，保卫着社会主义强国的国家利益。
    苏联不仅是世界上最大的陆上强国，同时也是伟大的海上强国。苏联的海岸线长达四万七千多公里，占苏联国境线总长的三分之二以上。苏维埃国家的国境濒临十四个海，直接与大西洋、太平洋、北冰洋三大洋相连。苏联通过这些大洋，同许多国家进行着经济上和文化上的联系。
    俄国人在很早以前就是勇敢的航海者，大胆的天才的探险家。他们对研究世界上的海洋提供了巨大的贡献。捷日湼夫、齐里柯夫、拉普捷夫兄弟、柴留斯金、拉札列夫、里特盍、马卡洛夫、谢道夫等人和许多苏维埃的北极地带探险家们的光辉业绩，已永远地被记入地理科学之中了。
    俄国海员进行科学探险和发现的目的，一向是不同于资本主义国家的海军军人的，后者的意图是进行殖民地的掠夺，奴役弱小民族，很少关心到丰富科学的问题。
    发现亚洲的东北角、亚洲和美洲之间的海峡、美洲的西北岸、世界上的第六大洲——南极洲大陆以及北冰洋、太平洋上的许多岛屿的荣誉，是属于俄国人的。有五百六十四个由俄国人发现的海洋、海峡、岛屿的地理名称被列入了海洋地图之上。
    在苏维埃政权下，科学的探险工作获得了特别广大的规模。在十月革命以后的时期里，苏维埃国家进行了二十五次最重大的探险，这对掌握苏维埃海路起了极重大的作用，而且对科学也有很大的贡献。仅从一九二四到一九四○年，苏联便组织了十次大规模的海洋上的探险，同时美国在这些年里总共只进行了三次探险，而英国则只有一次。
    这种真正科学的探险目的，是与现代资本主义国家迥然不同的。例如美国在北极地带，包括在格陵兰北部、漂浮在中央北极地区的浮冰岛等地所进行的一切“研究”工作，都是服从于它的战略计划的。
    我国的先辈曾不得不同那些企图把俄国从海洋之滨挤退到森林和草原深处的敌人时常进行流血斗争。在这些战斗里，俄国海员为自己的战旗增添了不朽的光荣。喀琅施塔得海员的英勇功绩，一七一四年年轻的俄国海军在汉哥获得的第一次伟大胜利，在塞瓦斯托波尔、彼德罗巴夫洛夫斯克、堪察加半岛等地的英勇保卫战，永远留在苏维埃人民的记忆里。
    俄罗斯的水兵和战士们在声势浩大的敌人面前保卫自己祖国时，表现出的那种奋不顾身的英勇气概，使整个世界为之惊讶。列·托尔斯泰在描写塞瓦斯托波尔的保卫者时写道：“塞瓦斯托波尔这部史诗将在俄国永垂不朽，史诗的主人翁就是俄罗斯人民……”
    早在用帆船航行的时代，俄国的海员便和敌人进行过二十余次大会战，而且完全战胜了敌人。俄国的海军培育了在海上取胜的卓越的创造者和组织者，先进的海军统帅——如爱国志士乌沙柯夫、谢那雅温、拉扎列夫、纳希莫夫等人。
    从俄国海军军人中，不但出现了许多举世闻名的旅行家、海洋和岛屿的发现者、无畏的海员和军官、海上战斗英雄，而且出现了许多有才干的、富于钻研精神的发明家、革新者和科学家。
    尼科诺夫、布博诺夫、季托夫、那列托夫、马卡洛夫以及社会主义劳动英雄、院士克雷洛夫等人，推动了我们祖国的造船业，使之达到了世界上的首位。装甲巡洋舰、快速水雷艇、潜水艇、鱼雷艇、水雷武器、造船电气技术以及海军许多其它最重要的战斗的和技术上的工具，最初都是在我国设计和制造的，只是在后来才为外国所剽窃。
    俄国海军军官莫让依斯基，在世界上第一个设计了并实验了飞机。不久前为纪念海军要塞喀琅施塔得奠基二百五十周年，授予俄罗斯海员之城—喀琅施塔得以红旗勋章。我们的伟大先辈，无线电、无线电测位术发明者波波夫就是在这里发明无线电和无线电测位术的。
    在苏维埃政权的年代里，我们祖国的海军得到了真正的发展。共产党和伟大的列宁在组织俄国人民争取社会主义革命胜利的斗争时，曾认为陆军与海军的工作是有重大的意义的。一九一八年二月十二日列宁签署了建立红海军命令。
    共产党从海军军人之中提拔和培养了革命斗争的杰出的组织者和领导者，如乌里扬采夫、斯拉得科夫、马尔金、波日洛夫、热列兹尼雅科夫等人。
    由共产党领导的海军军人们，非常积极地参加了伟大的十月社会主义革命，参加了推翻地主和资本家的政权的斗争。
    年轻的陆军和海军，在同苏维埃祖国无数敌人进行顽强的战斗中间成长起来并得到了锻炼。党把海军派到最重要的战线上去。苏维埃的舰队在伏尔加河、呵马河、北德维那河，西德维那河、顿河、第聂伯河、黑龙江、阿尼牙湖和刺多牙湖等地顺利地击退了为美帝国主义所煽动起来的外国武装干涉者和白卫分子。有六万多名海军军人参加到红军、骑兵、装甲列车的队伍里进行战斗。
    在伟大的革命战斗中锻炼起来的，无限忠实于自己社会主义祖国的海军军人们，光荣地完成了共产党和苏维埃政府所给予的全部任务。
    着手进行和平建设的苏维埃人民，极其注意巩固自己国家的防御能力和加强武装部队。而恢复与发展海军是有着特别重大的意义的。
    一九二一年三月，苏联共产党第十次代表大会通过了一项关于海军问题的特别决议，这项决议规定要保证迅速恢复和巩固红海军。
    一九二二年，列宁共产主义青年团负起了帮助海军的义务。青年团把自己的优秀儿女派到舰队、海军里工作，送到海军学校去学习。
    由于全苏人民的努力，顺利地恢复了军舰并且开始了航行。在一九二四—一九二五年，苏维埃的
  “阿芙乐尔号”、“共青团员号”、“沃洛夫斯基号”、“无产者号”等军舰举行了最初的几次远航。
    国家的社会主义工业化和农业集体化为陆海军的进一步发展和巩固提供了强大的经济基础。由于第一个五年计划的完成，因而有了近代化的主力舰，增强了潜水艇，巩固了海防，大力发展了造船工业。这使得在一九三二年建立了太平洋舰队，一九三三年建立了北方舰队。
    海军得到了许多精通业务的、热爱祖国的海军干部，他们是根据苏联军事科学的要求，根据现代战争特点的需要受过训练的干部。
    由共产党所培养起来的苏维埃海军军人，在伟大卫国战争年代里，为自己祖国的荣誉与独立进行了奋勇的斗争。在同德国法西斯分子和日本帝国主义分子作战时，他们表现出了集体的英雄主义精神、空前未有的刚毅、英勇和豪迈。陆军和海军的战士们，完成了自己的历史使命，没有辜负了自己人民的热爱和信任，没有辜负了一切进步人类的崇高期望。
    苏联人民对海军的战功和英勇的伟迹给予了很高的评价。许多军舰、舰队和联队荣膺了苏联勋章，数十艘军舰被改称为近卫军。五百一十三名海军战士、军士、军官荣获了苏联英雄的称号，有七名海军军人是苏联英雄称号的两次获得者。三十五万多名海军军人荣获了勋章和奖章。
    共产党和苏维埃政府不断关怀着加强我国的武装力量，苏联人民已取得的和平与创造性劳动的可靠保卫者。社会主义工业，以近代的威力巨大的武器、复杂的机器、最准确的仪器来装备陆海空军。战后又以新的军舰充实了海军。
    海军军人深深地感到了共产党和苏维埃政府对自己的不断关怀，正在孜孜不倦地提高自己的军事、政治知识，掌握现代的战斗技术和新式武器，加强自己队伍中的纪律性和组织性。
    一九五三年六月曾航驶到英国的“斯维尔德洛夫号”巡洋舰全体船员表现出了受过航海训练与锻炼、有着熟练的航海技术和高度纪律性的辉煌范例。
    去年苏联的军舰曾到过人民民主国家作友谊的访问。今年，“那希莫夫海军上将号”巡洋舰和黑海舰队的许多其它军舰也访问了阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国。苏维埃国家的使者——我们的光荣的黑海舰队同阿尔巴尼亚劳动人民的会见，是苏联与阿尔巴尼亚两国人民牢不可破的友谊的强大示威。
    今年，苏联军舰准备要远航到外国去数次，海军军人们正在精心地准备迎接即将来临的航行。
    苏联人民为自己的武装力量感到自豪，他们热情地支持自己的陆军和海军。成千上万的苏联人参加了苏联陆、海、空军协助会的活动，就是人民对苏联陆海军的无限热爱与爱国主义的关怀的鲜明表现。陆海空军协助会会员在研究陆军、空军作业的同时，还顽强地学习着各种海军专业技术。
    苏联的海军人员，同陆军、空军战士们一道，不惜自己的力量和毅力，致力于进一步加强社会主义祖国——各族人民和平与安全的堡垒的国防威力。
    忠实于自己天职的海军战士们，今后仍将永远矢忠地、热心地为苏联人民服务，可靠地守卫海防，保卫伟大苏维埃祖国的国家利益。
