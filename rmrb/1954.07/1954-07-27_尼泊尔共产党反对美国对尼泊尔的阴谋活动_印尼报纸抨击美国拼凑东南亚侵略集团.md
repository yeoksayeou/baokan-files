Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, July 25th: According to Indian newspaper reports, the Nepalese Communist Party recently issued a statement accusing American imperialism of plotting to turn Nepal into an American military base and demanding that all national democrats unite and take joint action to oppose American conspiracy activities in Nepal.

The statement pointed out that the recent discovery of the United States transporting military equipment to the Gorkha Party and other events show that the United States is attempting to use the most reactionary feudal elements to organize a military coup to seize power in Nepal, so that it can establish a base for aggression against China in Nepal. The statement revealed that the United States is spending large amounts of US dollars in Nepal to engage in conspiracy activities and is trying to create misunderstandings between Nepal and China, as well as between Nepal and India. The statement pointed out that American activities in Nepal are a serious danger, and said: If we do not fight in time, we will suffer the same fate as East Pakistan or other countries under American military rule.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, July 25th: "Indonesia Raya" published a commentary on the 23rd, saying that when all other countries are rejoicing at hearing the good news of the ceasefire in Indochina, why is the United States so unhappy?

The United States has been plotting from the beginning to obstruct the restoration of peace in Indochina. After the ceasefire agreement was reached, the United States immediately used the Philippines and Thailand as its pawns to intensify its conspiracy to organize a Southeast Asian group.

The Indonesian "People's Daily" on the 23rd called on people to maintain a high degree of vigilance against Dulles, Smith, and Eisenhower's recent statements expressing their intention to intensify the organization of a Southeast Asian group and not be bound by the Indochina ceasefire agreement.

The newspaper pointed out the importance of consolidating the victory of peace in Geneva. The "People's Daily" said: The most important historical fact at present is first: The People's Republic of China has played an extremely important role in resolving current disputes, and the Geneva Conference has proved this. Therefore, the world must assume responsibility and force American imperialists to agree to the People's Republic of China entering the United Nations. Second, the Five-Power Conference is the most effective meeting venue. The five major powers, including the People's Republic of China, must continue to work to resolve current disputes not only in Asia but also in other parts of the world through consultation and peaceful means.

The newspaper said: "These are the two factors that guarantee lasting peace."

    尼泊尔共产党反对美国对尼泊尔的阴谋活动
    印尼报纸抨击美国拼凑东南亚侵略集团
    【新华社新德里二十五日电】据印度报纸消息，尼泊尔共产党最近发表声明，指责美帝国主义企图把尼泊尔变为美国的军事基地的阴谋，并要求全国民主人士团结起来，采取联合行动来反对美国在尼泊尔的阴谋活动。
    声明指出，最近发现美国运送军事装备给廓尔喀党一事以及其他事件说明，美国正企图利用最反动的封建主义分子，组织军事政变来夺取尼泊尔的政权，以便它在尼泊尔建立侵略中国的基地。声明揭露，美国正在尼泊尔花费大量的美元来从事阴谋活动，并力图在尼泊尔和中国以及尼泊尔和印度之间制造误解。声明指出，美国在尼泊尔的活动是严重的危险，并说：如果我们不及时进行斗争，就会遭到和东巴基斯坦或其他美国军事统治下的国家一样的命运。
    【新华社雅加达二十五日电】“印尼新闻”二十三日发表评论说，当所有其他国家都因听到印度支那停火的好消息而欢欣鼓舞的时候，为什么美国却非常不高兴呢？
    美国从一开始就阴谋阻挠恢复印度支那的和平。当停火问题达成协议以后，美国又马上利用菲律宾和泰国充当它的走卒，加紧进行组织东南亚集团的阴谋。
    印尼“人民日报”二十三日要求人们对杜勒斯、史密斯和艾森豪威尔在最近的声明中表示要加紧组织东南亚集团和不受印度支那停火协定的约束一事保持高度警惕。
    这家报纸指出了巩固日内瓦和平胜利的重要性。“人民日报”说：目前最重要的具有历史意义的事实首先是：中华人民共和国在解决目前各项争端中起了极为重要的作用，日内瓦会议就证明了这一点。因此，世界必须承担责任，迫使美帝国主义者同意中华人民共和国进入联合国。第二，五大国会议是最有效的会议场合。包括中华人民共和国在内的五大国必须继续工作，以通过协商、通过和平方式来解决目前不但在亚洲而且在世界其他地方存在的争端。
    这家报纸说：“这是保证持久和平的两个因素。”
