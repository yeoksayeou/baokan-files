Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, July 17th: Our special correspondent reports: Many signs appearing in recent days have cast a shadow over the prospect of a visible agreement to restore peace in Indochina. Many reports indicate that after the Paris talks, the U.S. is intensifying its activities to plot the Southeast Asia aggression bloc. Of particular concern here is the urgency with which U.S. authorities are trying to drag Bao Dai Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos into the Southeast Asia aggression bloc. With this plan, the U.S. hopes to obstruct the Geneva Conference from reaching an agreement on restoring peace in Indochina in the final five minutes.

It is noted that U.S. Undersecretary of State Smith returned to Geneva on the 17th. A news item issued by the Associated Press on the morning of the 17th, when talking about Smith's mission to Geneva, said that Smith "must work out a way with other ministers... to allow Washington to provide aid and protection to southern Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia." The news went on to point out that the so-called "protection" is to place these three countries "within the scope of a broader Western security pact," that is, within the so-called "Southeast Asia Defense Treaty" aimed at preparing for a new war.

Similar news has been widely circulating in Geneva these past two days. Many Western journalists have revealed that this issue was touched upon in the Paris talks. They also said that Dulles had particularly emphasized in Paris the U.S. determination to make Bao Dai Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos participate in the Southeast Asia aggression bloc. What is particularly suspicious is that some Western officials, when asked about this issue, equivocated and dared not deny it outright.

Authoritative sources here point out that the plan to make the three Indochinese states participate in the Southeast Asia aggression bloc not only directly violates the purpose of the Geneva Conference to seek peace in Indochina, but also directly undermines the basis for reaching an agreement at the Geneva Conference, because the purpose of the Geneva Conference is to stop hostilities in Indochina, to restore peace there, and to prevent the recurrence of war. If, on the one hand, peace is being negotiated, and on the other hand, the three Indochinese states are being dragged into an aggressive military bloc aimed at launching a war, then the armistice will become merely a breathing space for adjusting battle lines and deploying forces in order to launch a larger-scale war again. In this case, the armistice agreement will inevitably become a scrap of paper. People remember that as early as June, in off-the-record contacts in Geneva, responsible persons from certain delegations clearly stated that they guaranteed that the three Indochinese states would not participate in any military bloc and that no foreign country would establish military bases in these three countries. This guarantee greatly facilitated the convergence of opinions between the two sides and constituted an important basis for reaching an agreement. Now, when an agreement is close to being reached, more and more clamor about the three countries participating in the U.S.-manipulated Southeast Asia aggression bloc has drowned out the solemn guarantees that were once made. People cannot help but question: If the realization of the Indochina armistice only opens the way for Bao Dai Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos to participate in an aggressive war bloc, then what guarantee is there that this armistice will not become merely an interval between two wars? People cannot help but ask: If so, what was the purpose of the hard work in Geneva?

This is a question that must be clarified.

The Geneva Conference is at its most important moment. Mendès-France promised French parliamentarians that an agreement would be reached before July 20. That date is only three days away. It is noted that although off-the-record contacts in these two days have exchanged in-depth views on unresolved issues, not all parties have adopted the same spirit of mutual concession, and therefore the distance between the parties has not been eliminated. The U.S. propaganda machine is gloatingly spreading a pessimistic atmosphere. However, the forces of peace have the confidence to defeat all sabotage and obstruction conspiracies and promote an early agreement.

### 美国加紧阻挠在印度支那问题上达成协议  正策划把印度支那三国拉进东南亚侵略集团

    美国加紧阻挠在印度支那问题上达成协议
    正策划把印度支那三国拉进东南亚侵略集团
    【新华社日内瓦十七日电】本社特派记者报道：近几天来出现的许多迹象，给可以看得见的恢复印度支那和平的协议的前景投下了暗影。许多消息指出，在巴黎会谈以后，美国策划东南亚侵略集团的活动更为加紧了。特别引起此间人士严重注意的是，美国当局正急于把保大越南、柬埔寨、老挝拖入东南亚侵略集团，凭借这个计划，美国希望能在最后五分钟阻挠日内瓦会议就恢复印度支那和平问题达成协议。
    人们注意到，美国副国务卿史密斯已在十七日返日内瓦。美联社在十七日上午发出的一条消息中谈到史密斯来日内瓦的任务时说，史密斯“必须与其他部长们定出一个办法……容许华盛顿给南部的越南国、老挝和柬埔寨以援助和保护”。这条新闻接着指出，所谓“保护”的办法就是把这三个国家
  “置于一个较广泛的西方安全公约的范畴之内”，也就是说，置于以准备新战争为目的的所谓“东南亚防御公约”之内。
    诸如此类的消息，这两天在日内瓦广泛地流传着。许多西方国家的记者们都透露，巴黎会谈中曾涉及这个问题。他们还说，杜勒斯在巴黎曾特别强调美国使保大越南、柬埔寨、老挝参加东南亚侵略集团的决心。特别引起人们怀疑的是，某些西方官员在被问到这个问题时，闪铄其辞，不敢正面否认。
    此间权威人士指出，使印度支那三国参加东南亚侵略集团的计划，不仅直接违反日内瓦会议谋求印度支那和平的目的，而且直接破坏日内瓦会议达成协议的基础，因为日内瓦会议的目的是要使印度支那的敌对行动得以停止，使那里的和平得以恢复，使战争不致于重新爆发。如果一方面在谈判和平，另一方面又在把印度支那三国拉入旨在发动战争的侵略性军事集团，那末停战就将成为不过是为了调整战线、部署力量以便重新发动一个更大规模的战争的喘息期间。在这种情况下，停战协定势将成为一张废纸。人们记得，早在六月间，在日内瓦的会外接触中，某些代表团的负责人士曾经明确声明，保证印度支那三国不得参加任何军事集团，任何外国不在这三国建立军事基地。这种保证曾大大便利了双方意见的接近，构成了达成协议的重要基础。现在，当协议已接近达成的时候，越来越多的关于三国参加美国操纵的东南亚侵略集团的喧嚷，淹没了曾经作过的庄严保证。人们不能不发出疑问：如果印度支那停战的实现，只是给保大越南、柬埔寨与老挝打开了参加侵略性战争集团的道路，那末这个停战究竟有什么保证能不成为仅仅是两次战争间的间隙？人们也不能不问：如果如此，在日内瓦的辛勤努力究竟是为了什么？
    这是必须澄清的问题。
    日内瓦会议正处在最重要的时刻。孟戴斯—弗朗斯曾向法国议员承诺在七月二十日前达成协议。这个日期离现在只有三天了。人们注意到，这两天的会外接触虽然就尚未解决的问题深入地交换了意见，但是并不是有关方面都采取同样的互让精神，因而各方之间的距离还没有得到消除。美国宣传机器正在幸灾乐祸地散布悲观空气。然而和平力量有信心挫败各种破坏和阻挠阴谋，促使早日达成协议。
