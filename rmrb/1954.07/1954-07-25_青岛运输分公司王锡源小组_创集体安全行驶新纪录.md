    Qingdao Transportation Branch's Wang Xiyuan Group
    Creates New Collective Safe Driving Record
    The Wang Xiyuan Group of the Second Motor Vehicle Team of the Qingdao Branch of the Shandong Provincial Transportation Company, in the twenty months from its establishment to June of this year, safely traveled 534,106 kilometers, creating a new record for collective safe driving by the group.
    The reason why their group has not had an accident for a long time is mainly because they constantly improve their driving skills and regularly maintain the vehicles in good condition. Among the seven people in the group, except for the group leader Wang Xiyuan, who has nine years of driving experience, the rest are young driving workers who have just learned to drive not long ago. Because of their low technical level, the whole group conscientiously studied the "Key Points of Advanced Automobile Driving Method." Wang Xiyuan also demonstrated his driving operation methods and introduced his experience in safe driving to help everyone improve their technical level. At the same time, they strengthened vehicle maintenance and strictly implemented the three-level maintenance system, thereby extending the service life of the vehicles.

    青岛运输分公司王锡源小组
    创集体安全行驶新纪录
    山东省运输公司青岛分公司第二汽车队王锡源小组，从成立到今年六月共二十个月中，安全行驶了五十三万四千一百零六公里，创造了小组集体安全行驶的新纪录。
    他们小组长期不出事故的原因，主要是不断地提高驾驶技术和经常保持车辆的完好。全小组七个人中，除小组长王锡源有九年驾驶经验外，其余都是刚学会开车不久的青年驾驶工人。因为技术水平低，全组都认真地学习了“先进汽车驾驶法要点”，王锡源并表演自己驾驶操作方法，介绍自己安全行驶的经验，帮助大家提高技术水平。同时，加强车辆保养工作，严格地执行了三级保养制度，因而也延长了车辆的使用寿命。
