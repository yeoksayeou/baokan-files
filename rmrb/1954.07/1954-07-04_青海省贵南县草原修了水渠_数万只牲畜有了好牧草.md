Water channels have been built on the Balohatan grassland in Guinan County, Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Region, Qinghai Province. This grassland was originally a lush pasture, but it could not be grazed due to lack of water. Last year, the People's Government led the herdsmen in building a five-and-a-half li long water channel, solving the problem of drinking water for people and livestock, and two-tenths of the grassland was utilized. Lambs eating this good grass grew as fat in the spring as in the autumn, and the survival rate of lambs reached 95 percent. This year, the People's Government continued to lead the herdsmen in building twenty-four li of small channels, excavating more than 10,000 cubic meters of earth. The entire channel was completed on May 20. Now five-tenths of the Balohatan grassland can be utilized, and more than 35,000 sheep, more than 4,200 cattle, and more than 800 horses from the Dancang and Maishiga tribes can graze on this grassland.

    青海省贵南县草原修了水渠
    数万只牲畜有了好牧草
    青海省海南藏族自治区贵南县巴洛哈滩草原上修了水渠。这块草滩原是丰美的草原，但因缺水，不能放牧。去年，人民政府领导牧民修了五里半长的水渠，解决了人和牛羊吃水问题，草原被利用了十分之二。羊吃到了这些好草春膘长得和秋膘一样，羊羔的成活率也达到百分之九十五。今年人民政府继续领导牧民修建小渠二十四里，挖土有一万余方。五月二十日全渠竣工，现在巴洛哈滩草原可以利用到十分之五，大仓、麦什尕两部落的三万五千多只羊、四千二百多头牛，八百多匹马都能在这草原上吃上好草了。
