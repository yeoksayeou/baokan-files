Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 28th: According to the Korean Central News Agency, the Cabinet of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea heard and discussed the report by Foreign Minister Nam Il on the work of the delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea at the Geneva Conference on the 24th, and adopted a decision on this matter.

The decision stated: The Cabinet of the Republic believes that the delegation of the Republic correctly carried out its work at the Geneva Conference, in accordance with the policy of the Republic's government to peacefully unify the fatherland, and with the active support of the delegations of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. Although the Geneva Conference failed to reach an agreement in the discussion on the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue due to the obstruction and sabotage of the United States and the Syngman Rhee clique that follows it, as well as the representatives of some Western countries, it has achieved certain successes.

The decision pointed out: The process of the Geneva Conference once again clearly confirmed that the consistent efforts of the Republic's government to peacefully resolve the Korean issue are in complete accordance with the national interests of the Korean people, and on the other hand, it once again exposed before the people of the world the reactionary and anti-people stance of the United States ruling clique and the Syngman Rhee gang, as well as the representatives of some Western countries, who oppose the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue and do not abandon their aggressive ambitions towards Korea.

The decision emphasized: The government of the Republic will strengthen the struggle to restore and develop the post-war people's economy and improve the people's living standards, so as to further consolidate the democratic base, which is an important guarantee for achieving the peaceful reunification of the fatherland. The government of the Republic will reflect the desire of the peace-loving people of the world to peacefully resolve the Korean issue and the long-cherished wish of all Korean people for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland, and continue to strengthen efforts to complete the unification of Korea through consultation, under the principle of the Korean people themselves solving the Korean issue.

    决定中说：共和国内阁认为，共和国代表团在日内瓦会议上，根据共和国政府和平统一祖国的政策，在苏联及中华人民共和国代表团的积极支持下，正确地进行了自己的工作。日内瓦会议虽然由于美国和追随它的李承晚匪帮及一部分西方国家代表的阻挠和破坏，在关于和平解决朝鲜问题的讨论中，未能达成协议，但是取得了一定的成就。
