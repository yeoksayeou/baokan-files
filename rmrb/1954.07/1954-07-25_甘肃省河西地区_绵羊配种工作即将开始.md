    Mating Work for Sheep in the Hexi Region of Gansu Province is About to Begin
    Artificial insemination mating work for sheep in the Hexi Region of Gansu Province is about to begin. Forty-four artificial insemination mating teams have set off one after another.
    In order to improve the quality of sheep, increase wool and mutton production, and support national industrial construction, Gansu Province plans to use artificial insemination to mate 62,500 sheep in the Hexi Region this year, an increase of more than 14% compared to 1953. By the end of June, the Animal Husbandry Bureau of the Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the Gansu Provincial People's Government had dispatched 44 artificial insemination mating teams, carrying Xinjiang breeding rams, various artificial insemination equipment, medicines, and tents, to Wuwei, Jiuquan, Yongchang, Shandan, Yongdeng, Minle, and the Tianzhu Tibetan Autonomous Region, the Sunan Yugur Autonomous Region, and other places to help farmers and herdsmen of all ethnic groups mate their local sheep with Xinjiang sheep breeds. The Provincial Animal Husbandry Bureau requires that the pregnancy rate of sheep mated this year reach 85%, the lambing rate reach 95%, and the survival rate reach 85%.
    State-owned farms and sheep improvement and promotion stations in various regions have also guided farmers and herdsmen in making full preparations in advance. A total of 44 mating pastures have been surveyed and determined, more than 2,000 teaser rams have been prepared, and mating pens have been repaired and expanded. Existing artificial insemination personnel from various regions were concentrated in various stations for training, and a new batch of artificial insemination workers were trained at the Yongchang Sheep Improvement and Breeding Farm. The masses in the above-mentioned areas are actively preparing for sheep mating, and more than 70,000 local and hybrid ewes that meet the standards of coat color, physique, and age have been registered.

    甘肃省河西地区人工授精绵羊配种工作即将开始，四十四个人工授精配种队已先后出发。
    为了改良绵羊品质，增产羊毛和羊肉，支援国家工业建设，甘肃省计划今年在河西地区用人工授精法配种绵羊六万二千五百只，较一九五三年增加了百分之十四多。到六月底，甘肃省人民政府农林厅畜牧局已派出四十四个人工授精配种队，携带新疆种公羊、各种人工授精器械、药品和帐篷等，先后分别到武威、酒泉、永昌、山丹、永登、民乐和天祝藏族自治区、肃南裕固族自治区等地，帮助各族农牧民用新疆羊种给当地绵羊配种。省畜牧局要求今年配种后的绵羊，受胎率要达到百分之八十五，产羔率要达到百分之九十五，成活率要达到百分之八十五。
    各地国营牧场和绵羊改良推广站，并在事先指导各地农牧民作了充分的准备工作，共勘察确定了四十四个配种草地，准备了两千多只试情公羊，整修和增修了配种圈；集中各地原有人工授精人员在各站进行了学习，并在永昌绵羊改良繁殖场训练了一批新的人工授精工作人员。上述各地群众积极准备给绵羊配种，现已登记了毛色、体质、年龄合格的土种母羊和杂种母羊七万多只。
