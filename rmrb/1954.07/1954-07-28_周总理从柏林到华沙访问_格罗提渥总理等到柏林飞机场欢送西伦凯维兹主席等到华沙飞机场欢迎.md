Premier Zhou Enlai inspected the guard of honor and shook hands with the well-wishers. Premier Grotewohl delivered the following speech at the airport: Respected Premier Comrade, dear Chinese friends:

As you are about to leave our country, I would like to express once again our heartfelt gratitude to you, the members of the government of the People's Republic of China, and your staff.

The purpose of your visit to the German Democratic Republic is to further deepen and develop the close friendly relations between the peoples of Germany and China. Dear Premier Comrade, we are very pleased to say that this goal has been fully achieved.

Our purpose is also to inform the people of our two countries and make them aware of the commonality of our political and economic interests. These interests are to safeguard world peace and to carry out peaceful and democratic construction.

In this way, we have worked for peace. The German people, like the Chinese people, need peace in order to realize the great plans for social progress. Under the leadership of the Soviet Union, Premier Comrade, you, together with the representative of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, have put forward a plan for peace and have guided it to victory. The realization of the ceasefire in Indochina will also leave a lasting impression on the German people. At the same time, the German people have gained new hope in solving the German problem. The peace-loving German people express their deep gratitude for this great support.

Your visit has once again strengthened the belief of the German people that they have a strong and victorious friend marching forward, united in the great peace camp headed by the socialist Soviet Union.

We hope that you and the entire Chinese people will achieve further great success in realizing the wise plans for peaceful and democratic construction of your country.

Dear Premier Comrade, I ask you to convey our deep brotherly respect to the great Chinese people, to Comrade Mao Zedong and the government of the People's Republic of China.

We wish you and the members of the government of the People's Republic of China a safe return to your motherland, and we bid you farewell here with the hope of meeting again.

Premier Zhou Enlai delivered the following speech: Respected Premier Comrade, dear comrades and friends:

After a three-day visit to the German Democratic Republic, I am now about to bid you farewell.

During the short three-day visit, thanks to the efficient arrangements of the government of the German Democratic Republic, I not only met with the heads of various departments of the government of the German Democratic Republic, the leaders of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, and the leaders of the various democratic parties in the parliament, but I also met with representatives of the broad masses at the citizens' meeting, and with workers and activists in the factory, and with well-known professors and scientists at the university; I also met with the lively and cheerful young people and Young Pioneers of Greater Berlin. I have personally witnessed the strong will and brilliant achievements of the German people under the leadership of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany in rebuilding their motherland. I will never forget all of this.

Dear comrades and friends, the German people are a creative nation, a nation that is not afraid of difficulties and can overcome them. Now, they are waging unremitting struggles with a firm will to establish a peaceful, unified, independent, and democratic Germany. This struggle is just, and the Chinese people will always support this just struggle.

This time, after the Geneva Conference, the Soviet government proposed to convene a conference of all European countries to discuss the establishment of a European collective security system. This proposal will further open up avenues for solving the problem of peaceful reunification of Germany. I believe that anyone who does not want to see Germany and Europe fall into long-term division and confrontation has no reason to oppose this reasonable proposal of the Soviet government.

During this visit, we not only received the warm welcome and hospitality of the government and people of the German Democratic Republic, and were honored by Humboldt University with an honorary doctorate, which is an honor bestowed by the German people on the Chinese people, and a manifestation of their fraternal love for the Chinese people. For this, Premier Comrade, please allow me to express my deep gratitude to you and to the government and people of the German Democratic Republic.

The Chinese people value their friendship with the German people very much, and believe that it is a great honor to be able to cooperate with the German people side by side in the cause of peace. The Sino-German Joint Communiqué issued on July 25th affirmatively proves that the people of China and Germany will further develop their friendship and cooperation to consolidate and strengthen the world's forces of peace and democracy headed by the Soviet Union.

Long live the friendship and cooperation between China and Germany!

Premier Zhou Enlai then boarded the plane and waved to the well-wishers at the door of the cabin.

Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, July 27th: Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, arrived in Warsaw by plane from Berlin on the 26th at the invitation of the government of the Polish People's Republic. Accompanying Premier Zhou Enlai were Zhang Wentian, representative of the Chinese delegation to the Geneva Conference and Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Secretary-General Wang Bingnan, and advisors Qiao Guanhua and Chen Jiakang.

Those who welcomed him at the airport included: Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Polish People's Republic Cyrankiewicz, First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers Nowak, Deputy Chairmen of the Council of Ministers Berman, Jaroszewicz, and Indrihovsky, members of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, Secretaries of the Central Committee Ochab, Majur, and Dvořákovský, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Poland Skrzeszewski, members of the Polish Council of State, ministers and deputy ministers of various ministries of the Polish government, and representatives of the Polish army, various political parties, and people's organizations.

After Premier Zhou Enlai got off the plane, he accepted flowers presented by Chairman of the Polish Council of Ministers Cyrankiewicz, and the band played the national anthems of the People's Republic of China and the Polish People's Republic. Premier Zhou Enlai, accompanied by Chairman of the Polish Council of Ministers Cyrankiewicz and Deputy Minister of National Defense General Pobvavsky, inspected the guard of honor. Then, Premier Zhou Enlai shook hands cordially with the welcomers one by one.

Premier Zhou Enlai made the following remarks at the airport: Respected Chairman of the Council of Ministers Comrade: Dear comrades and friends:

I am deeply honored to have the opportunity to visit the Polish People's Republic after the end of the Geneva Conference. Upon arriving in Warsaw, the capital of the Polish People's Republic, I would like to first extend my warm regards on behalf of the government and people of the People's Republic of China to the government and people of Poland, and I would like to express my sincere gratitude for the kind invitation of the Polish government.

The people of China and Poland have a deep friendship. I am convinced that the continued strengthening of friendly cooperation between our two countries will make valuable contributions to the common economic upsurge and the common cause of safeguarding world peace. The recent agreement reached at the Geneva Conference on the restoration of peace in Indochina has been warmly welcomed by the people of China and Poland. Because it not only allows the war in Indochina to stop, but also brings new hope for establishing and maintaining collective security and peace in Asia and Europe. The Polish government and people helped the Korean armistice with their participation in the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, and will now participate in the Indochina International Commission to supervise the current work in Indochina. The Polish government and people have made great contributions to maintaining peace in Asia, and the Chinese government and people warmly support these peaceful efforts of the Polish government and people. Strengthening friendly cooperation between China and Poland will surely further strengthen the world's forces of peace headed by the Soviet Union, and further consolidate peace and security in Asia and Europe.

Long live the friendly cooperation between the People's Republic of China and the Polish People's Republic!

Long live peace!

    在你们即将离开我们国土的时候，我向你和中华人民共和国政府的人员们以及你的工作人员们再一次表示我们衷心的感谢。
    你在德意志民主共和国的访问目的，是为了进一步加深与发展德中两国人民间亲密的友好关系。亲爱的总理同志，我们非常高兴地说，这个目的已经完全实现了。
    我们的目的还在于告诉我们两国人民并使他们认识到我们在政治和经济利益上的一致性。这种利益就是维护世界和平与进行和平民主的建设。
    这样，我们就已为和平做了工作。德国人民正像中国人民一样需要和平，以便实现社会进步的各项伟大计划。在苏联的领导下，总理同志，你和越南民主共和国的代表一起提出了一个和平的计划，并已将其导向胜利。印度支那停战的实现，也将在德国人民中间留下永恒的印象。同时，在解决德国问题上德国人民已经获得了新的希望。爱好和平的德国人民对这种伟大的支持，表示深深的感谢。
    你的访问又一次地加强了德国人民的信念，就是他们有着一个团结在以社会主义苏联为首的伟大和平阵营中的胜利前进着的强大朋友。
    我们希望你及全体中国人民在实现你们国家各项和平民主建设的英明计划中获得进一步的伟大成就。
    亲爱的总理同志，我请求你将我们深厚的兄弟般的敬意带给伟大的中国人民，带给毛泽东同志和中华人民共和国政府。
    我们希望你以及中华人民共和国政府的人员们平安地回到你们的祖国，我们怀着重见的愿望在这里向你们告别。
    周恩来总理致词如下：敬爱的总理同志，亲爱的同志们和朋友们：
    我在德意志民主共和国作了三天的访问以后，现在即将向你们告别。
    在短短三天的访问中，由于德意志民主共和国政府有效率的安排，我不仅会见了德意志民主共和国政府各部门的首长、德国统一社会党的领导者和议会中各民主党派的领导者，同时我还在市民大会中会见了广大的群众代表，在工厂中会见了工人群众和积极分子，在大学中会见了知名的教授和科学家；我还会见了大柏林市的活泼愉快的青年和少先队员。我亲眼看到了德意志人民在德国统一社会党的领导下，为了重建他们的祖国所表现出的坚强毅力和已经取得的辉煌成绩。这一切都是我永远不能忘记的。
    亲爱的同志们和朋友们，德意志人民是一个富有创造性的民族，是一个不怕困难而能克服困难的民族，现在，他们正以坚强的意志为建立一个和平统一的独立的民主的德国而进行不懈的斗争。这一斗争是正义的，中国人民对于这一正义的斗争是会永远加以支持的。
    这次苏联政府继日内瓦会议之后，建议召开一个全欧洲国家的会议，讨论建立欧洲集体安全体系的问题。这一建议将进一步为解决和平统一德国问题开辟途径。我认为，凡属不愿使德国及欧洲陷于长期分裂和对立的人，对于苏联政府这一合理的建议是没有任何理由加以反对的。
    在这次访问期间，我们不仅受到了德意志民主共和国政府和人民的热烈欢迎和盛情接待，并承胡包特大学授予我荣誉的博士学位，这都是德意志人民给予中国人民的荣誉，也是他们对中国人民所表示的兄弟般的友爱。对此，总理同志，请允许我向您并向德意志民主共和国的政府和人民表示深切的感谢。
    中国人民很重视他们与德意志人民的友谊，并且认为在和平的事业中能与德意志人民并肩合作是非常值得自豪的。七月二十五日发表的中德联合公报肯定地证明中德两国人民将会进一步发展他们之间的友谊和合作，来巩固和加强以苏联为首的世界和平民主力量。
    中德友好合作万岁！
    周恩来总理接着走上飞机，在机舱门口向欢送的人们举手致意。

    中华人民共和国和波兰人民共和国友好合作万岁！
    和平万岁！
