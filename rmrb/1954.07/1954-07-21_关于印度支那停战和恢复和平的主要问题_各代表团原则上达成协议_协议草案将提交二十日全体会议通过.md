Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, 20th -- Special correspondent Shen Jiantu reports: A plenary session attended by all delegations will be held on the 20th to pass the draft agreement on the Indochina armistice and restoration of peace. Delegations are continuing to finalize the wording of the draft agreement in order to complete the drafting work.

Foreign ministers continued their contacts on the 20th to resolve issues still to be finalized in the draft agreement on the Indochina armistice and restoration of peace. During the contacts that the delegations continued until late on the 19th, agreement in principle was reached on important issues in the draft agreement.

The contacts on the 20th will be decisive for this final agreement that will bring about a ceasefire in the three Indochinese countries. Foreign Minister Molotov and Foreign Secretary Eden will hold talks on the morning of the 20th, and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai and Prime Minister Mendes-France will hold talks on the afternoon of the 20th. The Cambodian Foreign Minister will meet with Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai on the morning of the 20th.

Agreement in principle has already been reached late on the 19th on the major issues regarding the Indochina armistice and restoration of peace. These issues are: the provisional demarcation line of Vietnam; the regroupment areas of Laos; the composition of the International Supervisory Commission and the supervision of the armistice; the time limit for holding general elections; the time limit for the withdrawal of armed forces to the regroupment areas.

Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, 20th -- The conference discussing peace in Indochina has reached the eve of an agreement after ten weeks of negotiations. Geneva is now filled with an ever-increasing atmosphere of optimism and expectation.

On the morning of the 20th, a large number of journalists from various countries rushed to the "Press Building" early, waiting to receive news of an agreement at any time. Radio commentators are already trying to find out how long the documents to be passed by the conference will be in order to adjust their broadcast programs.

Spokespersons for some delegations have been busy answering phone calls since the night of the 19th. Journalists are asking when the nine-nation delegations will hold the final plenary session to pass the agreement. An employee working in the League of Nations building said: "As long as the conference room is ready, it can be used at any time."

The newspapers on dozens of newsstands throughout the city sold particularly quickly on the morning of the 20th. Without exception, all local newspapers published optimistic predictions about the outcome of the conference on the 20th. "Journal de Genève" was titled "Geneva Conference Nearing Victory Day." "La Suisse" said that the conference may announce a ceasefire in Indochina within twenty-four hours. TASS's report on the night of the 19th about the imminent agreement at the conference was published in all the morning papers here on the 20th.

At the same time, more people from France came here on the 20th to call for peace than usual. Seeing the chance of a ceasefire in Indochina increasing, they could hardly contain their joy. Pierre Caldairou, a representative of 150 lawyers from Paris, said: "The peace that we have been asking for for almost eight years is about to be realized. How can we pretend to be nonchalant at such a time? Hopefully, this Indochina armistice can promote the permanent elimination of all wars." Mrs. Gadet, a railway worker's wife from Grenoble, said: "After an agreement is reached, we cannot relax. Those of us with children of draft age must be vigilant, guarding against any actions that would undermine this agreement and launch another war."

    关于印度支那停战和恢复和平的主要问题
    各代表团原则上达成协议
    协议草案将提交二十日全体会议通过
    【新华社日内瓦二十日电】本社特派记者沈建图报道：二十日将举行所有代表团参加的全体会议，以通过关于在印度支那停战和恢复和平的协议草案。各国代表团正在继续加紧最后确定协议草案的措辞，以完成文件的拟订工作。
    外长们二十日继续进行接触，以解决关于在印度支那停战和恢复和平的协议草案中尚待最后决定的问题。在各国代表团一直继续到十九日深夜的接触中间，关于协议草案的重要问题已在原则上达成协议。
    二十日的接触对于这个将使印度支那三国实现停火的最后协定，将有决定性的作用。莫洛托夫外长和艾登外交大臣二十日上午将举行会谈，周恩来外长和孟戴斯—弗朗斯外长二十日下午将举行会谈。柬埔寨外交大臣将在二十日上午访晤周恩来外长。
    十九日深夜已经就在印度支那停战和恢复和平方面的主要问题，在原则上达成协议。这些问题就是：越南的临时分界线；老挝的重新集结地区；国际监察委员会的组成和停战的监察；举行普选的时限；武装部队撤退到重新集结地区的时限。
    【新华社日内瓦二十日电】二十日，讨论印度支那和平的会议在经过十个星期的谈判之后，已到了达成协议的前夕。日内瓦现在充满了不断高涨的乐观和期待的气氛。
    二十日早晨，大批的各国记者特别早就拥到“新闻大厦”里，等待随时得到达成协议的消息。广播评论员已在设法打听会议将要通过的文件有多长，以便调整他们的广播节目。
    某些代表团的发言人从十九日夜里起就一直忙着接电话。记者们都询问，九国代表团要在什么时候举行最后的全体会议来通过协议。一位在国联大厦中工作的人员说：“只要会议室已经准备好，随时可以使用。”
    全市几十个报摊二十日早上的报纸卖得特别快。当地所有报纸二十日都没有例外地对会议的结果发表乐观的预测。“日内瓦日报”的标题是“日内瓦会议已临近胜利日”。“瑞士报”说，会议可能在二十四小时内宣布印度支那停火。塔斯社十九日夜报道会议即将达成协议的消息，在二十日这里所有的晨报上都登了出来。
    与此同时，二十日从法国来到这里呼吁和平的人也比往常多，他们看到印度支那停火的机会在增长，简直不能抑制住他们的高兴。巴黎一百五十名律师的代表皮埃尔·卡尔德说：“差不多八年来我们所一直要求的和平马上就要实现，在这样的时候，我们怎能装得出满不在乎的神气呢？希望这个印度支那的停战能促成永远消除一切战争。”格累诺布尔一位铁路工人的妻子加德特说：“在取得协议之后，我们还不能松懈下来。我们这些有役龄孩子的人们得警惕着，提防任何破坏这个协议和发动另一次战争的任何行动。”
