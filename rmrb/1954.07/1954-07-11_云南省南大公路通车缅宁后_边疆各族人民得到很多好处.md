    After the opening of the Nan (Jian) Da (Nanda) Highway in Yunnan Province to Mianning, supplies from the interior have been continuously transported to the border areas, bringing happiness to the people of all ethnic groups.
    Mianning is the location of the Mianning Special District Commissioner's Office and a hub for economic ties between the interior and the border counties of Cangyuan, Gengma, and Zhenkang. In the past, due to inconvenient transportation, material exchanges were greatly limited. Since the highway opened to Mianning, state-owned trading departments have transported more than 200 tons of goods, including cloth and general merchandise, from Kunming to supply the Dai, Kawa, Lahu, and other ethnic groups in the special district. During the rainy season this year, thanks to the sufficient reserves of the state-owned trading departments, the needs of the people of all ethnic groups have been met.
    The replacement of long-distance mule and horse transport with automobiles has greatly reduced freight costs and accelerated commodity circulation. The freight cost per ton of goods transported from Kunming to Mianning was formerly 4.49 million yuan, but now it is only 2.1 million yuan. In the past, it usually took more than forty days for goods sent from Kunming to Mianning to arrive, but now it only takes one week. The prices of industrial products have also been continuously decreasing as the highway opens. At the end of June, the prices of industrial products and miscellaneous goods transported from other areas were 3% to 20% lower than before the highway opened. The export volume of locally produced tea has also increased, and the purchase price has gradually increased. The Dai girls, who love beauty, have bought clothing and skirt fabrics from Shanghai, and many people wear new costumes made of colorful silk and cotton fabrics when they go to market or celebrate festivals.

    云南省南大公路通车缅宁后
    边疆各族人民得到很多好处
    云南省南（涧）大（南大）公路通车缅宁后，内地物资源源运到边疆，给各族人民带来了幸福。
    缅宁是缅宁专署所在地，是内地和边境的沧源、耿马、镇康等县经济联系的枢纽。过去由于交通不便，物资交流受到很大限制。公路通到缅宁后，国营贸易部门已经从昆明运去了布匹、百货等两百多吨物资，供应专区内的傣、佧瓦、拉祜等族人民。今年雨季期间，由于国营贸易部门储备充足，已能满足各族人民的需要。
    汽车代替了长途的骡马运输，大大降低了商品运费，并加快了商品流转。从昆明运往缅宁的物资，过去每吨运费要四百四十九万元，现在只要二百一十万元。过去从昆明发往缅宁的物资、通常要四十天以上才能到达，现在只要一个星期就可到达。工业品的价格也随着公路通车不断下降。六月底工业品和外区运去的土杂货的价格，比通车前降低了百分之三到百分之二十。当地盛产的茶叶输出量也增加了，收购价格逐渐提高。喜欢漂亮的傣族姑娘们，买到了来自上海的衣、裙料子，每逢赶街、过节的时候，许多人都穿起彩色丝棉织品制成的新装。                        （新华社）
