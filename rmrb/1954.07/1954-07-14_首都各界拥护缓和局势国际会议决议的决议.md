The All Circles in the Capital Supporting the Resolutions of the International Conference for Relaxation of Tension held a meeting, and after listening to the report by Guo Moruo, head of the Chinese delegation, on the situation and achievements of the International Conference for Relaxation of Tension held in Stockholm, Sweden, from June 19 to 23, 1954, unanimously agreed that the holding of the International Conference for Relaxation of Tension, reflecting the desire for peace of the people of the world, was very timely. The representatives of various countries participating in the conference included public leaders, social figures, and well-known figures from political, economic, cultural, scientific, artistic, and religious circles, which not only illustrates the broad representation of the conference, but also proves that the desire for peace of the people of the world is so strong and universal that any differences in nationality, occupation, political opinion, and religious belief cannot prevent them from uniting in the cause of peace. We, the Chinese people, thank the representatives of all countries participating in this conference—including our own—for their great efforts, and also thank the people of the world for their great contributions to seeking the relaxation of international tensions.

We, the Chinese people, are particularly pleased that the three important resolutions and other recommendations made by the International Conference for Relaxation of Tension fully express the sincere hope of the people of the world for easing the current international situation. We believe that the decisions made by this conference regarding the demand for an early ceasefire in Indochina and opposition to the continuation and expansion of this war, and regarding the demand for an early resumption of the interrupted negotiations on the Korean question and the prevention of the recurrence of the Korean War, are entirely in line with the interests of the Chinese people, the Asian people, and the people of the world, and are beneficial to the development of the ongoing Geneva Conference.

We, the Chinese people, solemnly declare to the people of the world that we are willing to work unremittingly to realize and implement the resolutions of the International Conference for Relaxation of Tension. We believe that the people of the world will certainly work with us. At present, the common goals of all peace-loving people in the world are to demand that the Geneva Conference reach an agreement on a ceasefire in Indochina, to demand that the governments of the countries concerned resume negotiations on the Korean question at an appropriate time, and to demand that other issues related to easing international tensions be resolved in a spirit of consultation among the countries concerned. Committing ourselves to the restoration and development of normal economic relations and cultural exchanges among the people of all countries in the world, and to promoting understanding, friendship, and cooperation among the people of all countries on the basis of peaceful intentions, is the common path of the peace-loving people of the world.

    首都各界拥护缓和局势国际会议决议的决议
    中国首都各界拥护缓和局势国际会议决议大会在听取了中国代表团郭沫若团长关于一九五四年六月十九日——二十三日在瑞典斯德哥尔摩召开的缓和局势国际会议情况与成就的报告后，一致认为反映着全世界人民和平意愿的缓和局势国际会议的召开是深合时宜的。参加这次会议的各国代表有各国人民的公众领袖，社会人士以及政治、经济、文化、科学、艺术、宗教等各界的著名人士，这不仅说明了这次会议的广泛的代表性，而且也证明着全世界人民对于和平的愿望是这样的强烈和普遍，以致任何不同的民族、职业、政治见解和宗教信仰的差别，都不能妨碍他们彼此在和平事业中团结起来。我们中国人民感谢参与这次会议的各国——包括我们中国在内——的代表们所作的巨大努力，同时也感谢全世界人民在寻求缓和国际局势工作上所作的巨大贡献。
    特别使我们中国人民感到满意的是：缓和局势国际会议所作的三项重要决议以及其他各项建议，充分地表达了全世界人民对于缓和当前国际局势的热诚希望。我们认为：这次会议关于要求尽快实现印度支那的停火与反对这一战争的继续和扩大，关于要求尽快恢复中断了的朝鲜问题谈判与防止朝鲜战争再起等决定，完全符合中国人民、亚洲人民和世界人民的利益，并且有益于正在进行中的日内瓦会议的发展。
    我们中国人民向全世界人民郑重宣告：我们愿意为实现与贯彻缓和局势国际会议的各项决议而努力不懈。我们相信全世界人民是一定会和我们一道努力的。在当前，要求日内瓦会议达成在印度支那停火的协议，要求各有关国家的政府在适当时机恢复朝鲜问题的谈判，要求有关缓和国际局势的其他问题在有关各国之间一本协商精神谋求解决，这些就是全世界愿意和平人民的共同努力的目标。而致力于恢复和发展全世界各国人民间的正常的经济关系和文化交流，促进各国人民间在和平意愿基础上的谅解、友好和合作，则是全世界愿意和平人民的共同努力的途径。
