    The Chinese edition of the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties' organ, "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" 1954, Issue 24, has been published.

    This issue publishes an editorial entitled "Standing at the Forefront of the Struggle for Peace and National Independence." The editorial points out: The most important task for the people of all countries is to strive for peace and ease international tensions. The movement of the people of all countries to defend peace has now reached an unprecedented climax and has become a powerful driving force of our time. In all capitalist countries, the Communist and Workers' Parties are the leading forces of the national and democratic movements. The struggle for peace is inextricably linked with the struggle for national sovereignty and national independence, and with the struggle of the working class and all working people for their vital interests. In order to further expand the peace movement, the primary task of the Communist and Workers' Parties is to win over more working people to join the ranks of peace fighters and to strive for the strong unity of the working class. The editorial then summarizes the situations of the Communist and Workers' Parties of France, Italy, Germany, and other capitalist countries in their struggle for peace and national independence. The editorial emphasizes that the Communist and Workers' Parties of capitalist countries are well aware that to establish a united front including all democratic national forces, it is necessary to make great efforts and give full play to initiative, and it is necessary to wage a relentless struggle against the imperialist agents who advocate abandoning national sovereignty and attempt to split the ranks of the fighters for peace and national independence.

    Important articles published in this issue include: "Strive for Peace, Strive for Democracy and National Independence, Strive for Socialism" by Maurice Thorez, General Secretary of the French Communist Party; "Strive to Change the Current French Policy, Strive for National Independence and Peace" by Jacques Duclos, Secretary of the French Communist Party; and "India's Movement for a Peaceful Solution to Asian Problems" by R. Chandra, Member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of India.

    The articles by Thorez and Duclos are their speeches and reports at the 13th Congress of the French Communist Party in June of this year. Thorez's article points out: The reason why this congress of the French Communist Party was able to arouse widespread and enthusiastic responses is because it reflected the increasingly fierce struggle of the masses to thoroughly change French policy, and pointed out the way for the working class, the people, and our entire nation to get rid of the current predicament and suffering. All strata of the working people are increasingly opposed to the war adventure policy. The masses of the people have seen that our party has not only correctly declared the necessity of changing this policy, but also correctly declared the possibility of changing this policy. Our people demand an immediate end to the war in Indochina and a negotiated settlement of the Indochina issue. The just proposals put forward by the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam at the Geneva Conference and supported by the Soviet Union and China have powerfully echoed the demands of our people. The article emphasizes that the French Communist Party has always spared no effort to strive for the unity of all democratic national forces, and will continue to do so in the future.

    Chandra's article summarizes the achievements of the All-India Conference Against the US-Pakistan Military Treaty and Advocating the Relaxation of International Tensions, held in early May. The article points out: The signing of the US-Pakistan military treaty has made all the people of India more deeply aware of the seriousness of the current international tension. It is these factors that have enabled people with extremely different political views to take a consistent stand on the issue of peace. The resolutions adopted at this conference reflected the unanimous views of the Indian people on the most important issues in the current international situation. The article concludes by saying that the resolutions of the conference have been enthusiastically responded to by the broad masses of the Indian people and have encouraged them to fight more resolutely for peace in Asia and the world.

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版一九五四年第二十四期内容介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版一九五四年第二十四期已经出版。
    本期以“站在为和平与民族独立而斗争的前列”为题发表社论。社论指出：各国人民当前最重要的任务就是争取和平和缓和国际紧张局势。各国人民保卫和平的运动现在已经达到空前的高潮，成为当代强大的动力。在所有的资本主义国家中，共产党和工人党是民族和民主运动的主导力量。争取和平的斗争是与争取国家主权和民族独立的斗争、与工人阶级和全体劳动人民群众为切身利益而作的斗争，不可分割地联系在一起的。为了进一步扩大和平运动，共产党和工人党的首要任务就是争取更多的劳动人民参加和平战士的队伍，争取工人阶级的坚强团结。社论接着综述了法国、意大利、德国以及其他资本主义国家的共产党和工人党为和平和民族独立而斗争的情形。社论着重说：资本主义国家的共产党和工人党都很了解，要建立一个包括所有民主的民族力量在内的统一战线，必须作很大的努力并发挥高度的主动性，必须进行无情的斗争，反对那些鼓吹放弃国家主权和企图分裂争取和平和民族独立的战士们的队伍的帝国主义代理人。
    本期刊载的重要文章有：法国共产党总书记多列士的“争取和平，争取民主和民族独立，争取社会主义”，法国共产党书记杜克洛的“争取改变法国现行政策，争取民族独立与和平”，印度共产党中央委员罗·钱德拉的“印度争取和平解决亚洲问题的运动”。
    多列士和杜克洛的文章是他们今年六月间在法共第十三次代表大会上的发言和报告。多列士的文章指出：法国共产党的这次代表大会所以能够引起普遍和热烈的反响，是因为它反映了群众争取彻底改变法国政策的日益猛烈的斗争，指出了工人阶级、人民和我们整个民族摆脱目前的困境和苦难的道路。劳动人民的各阶层日益反对战争冒险政策。人民群众已经看到，我们党不仅多么正确地宣布了改变这种政策的必要性，而且多么正确地宣布了改变这种政策的可能性。我国人民要求立即停止印度支那战争并通过协商方式解决印度支那问题。越南民主共和国政府在日内瓦会议上提出的并为苏联和中国所支持的公正的建议，有力地呼应了我国人民的要求。文章着重说，法国共产党一向不遗余力地争取一切民主的民族力量的团结，今后仍然是这样。
    钱德拉的文章综述了五月初举行的全印反对美巴军事条约，主张缓和国际紧张局势大会的成就。文章指出：美巴军事条约的签订，使印度全体人民更加深刻地认识到目前国际紧张局势的严重性。正是这些因素使政治见解极不相同的人士对和平问题采取了一致的立场。这次大会所通过的各项决议反映了印度人民对目前国际局势中最重大的问题的一致见解。文章最后说，大会的各项决议已得到印度广大人民的热烈响应，并且鼓舞着他们更坚决地为亚洲和全世界的和平而奋斗。
