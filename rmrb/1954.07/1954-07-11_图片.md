On the afternoon of April 29th this year, after a rain, a strong wind rose, and the tide of the Chongchon River, carrying silt, rose sharply. The sandy beach in the heart of the river was about to be submerged by the sea. Huang Guangbao, a soldier of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army stationed in Bofei-ri, Mundok County, South Pyongan Province, Korea, saw from afar several children catching crabs in the river being stranded on the sandy beach in the heart of the river. He immediately called out three other soldiers who were studying culture, and together they jumped into the Chongchon River and rescued the three Korean children from the rapids. These four volunteer soldiers, Weng Ziguang, Huang Guangbao (both Communist Party members), Deng Zhengshi, and Hu Zhitian (both members of the Communist Youth League), were all soldiers of the company where the immortal internationalist fighter Luo Shengjiao was before his death, and they were all from Hunan. The three rescued Korean children were: Kim In-chang, 15, Kim In-sang, and Cao Shi-xing, 9. They are all happily studying in a peaceful environment.

The picture below is a group photo of the soldiers and the children. From left to right, back row: Weng Ziguang, Hu Zhitian, Deng Zhengshi, Huang Guangbao. Front row: Kim In-chang, Kim In-sang, Cao Shi-xing. (Draft from the People's Liberation Army Pictorial, photo by Tan Shaohua)

    今年四月二十九日下午，一阵雨后，狂风大作，清川江的潮水卷着泥沙急剧上涨，江心的沙滩也快被海水吞没了。驻在朝鲜平安南道文德郡博飞里的志愿军某部战士黄光保，远处看见几个在江中捉螃蟹的孩子被隔在江心的沙滩上，他马上叫出来正在学文化的另外三个战士，一块跳进了清川江，从急流中救出了三个朝鲜孩子。这四个志愿军战士翁梓光、黄光保（都是共产党员）、邓正仕、胡芝田（都是青年团员），都是不朽的国际主义战士罗盛教烈士生前所在连队的战士，也都是湖南人。被救的三个朝鲜孩子是：十五岁的金仁昌、金仁相和九岁的曹士星。他们都在和平的环境中愉快地学习着。
