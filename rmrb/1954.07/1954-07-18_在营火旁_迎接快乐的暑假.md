Xinhua News Agency reporter Sun Shikao:

    On the evening of July 14th, after a brief shower, the streets of the capital were refreshed. More than two thousand children, filled with joy and dressed in their holiday best, flocked from all directions to the Beijing No. 25 Middle School stadium. Teams of Young Pioneers sat on the green grass. They were all there to participate in the "Welcoming a Happy Summer Vacation" campfire party. Wang Guangru, a nine-year-old Young Pioneer from the Dongdan District Central Primary School who presented flowers to Chairman Mao on this year’s May Day, appeared, and groups of children immediately surrounded her. Wu Zhenguo, a combat hero from a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, musician Ma Ke, Qiao Yu, the author of the children's drama "Orchard Sisters," and Wang Mingfu and Chen Zheng, the authors of the children's play "Be a Good Team Member," and other literary and art workers beloved by the children also came to offer their congratulations.

    At 8 o'clock, Zhang Junying, the little chairman of the campfire party and a Young Pioneer from Peiyuan Primary School who presented flowers to Chairman Mao on last year's National Day, announced the opening of the meeting. The venue immediately transformed from boisterous to quiet. She spoke on behalf of the millions of happy children in the capital, and finally said: Let us dance heartily around the campfire and spend this happy and beautiful night! At this moment, a group of children wearing red scarves sang in unison to the light music played by the uncles from the military band of the General Staff Department of the Central People's Government's Revolutionary Military Commission, who were invited to participate in the campfire party: The campfire is burning, our songs are flying, our laughter is flying... Five children holding torches invited their beloved musicians, writers, and representatives from the Youth and Children's Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League to light the campfire.

    Beside the roaring campfire, the children sang and danced to their hearts' content. More than forty Young Pioneers from the Xidan District First Central Primary School sang "Our Holiday" and "We Sing Happily," and Ji Jingyi, a student from the Second Affiliated Elementary School of Beijing Normal University, recited the poem "Happy Summer Vacation," newly written for the children by the writer Yuan Ying. Nine little girls, dressed as beautiful girls from ethnic minorities, gracefully danced the "Singing of Chairman Mao." After the Xidan District First Central Primary School performed the graceful "Wild Goose Dance," the little chairman excitedly shouted: I have good news to report! "Sister Moon" and "Little Star" have also come to join our party! Immediately, the audience burst into enthusiastic applause, and beautiful "Sister Moon" and "Little Star" indeed appeared from beside the bright campfire. They were played by two young actors from the China National Theatre for Children. "Little Star" said to the children in a bright voice: Are you welcome to me and Sister Moon to join your campfire party? Before the words were finished, a group of children on the opposite side shouted loudly: "Welcome!" Groups of children rushed forward, pulling "Sister Moon" and "Little Star" to sing and dance together.

    The breeze blowing from afar made the campfire burn brighter and brighter. The firelight reddened the children's faces. The military band played a lively dance tune again, and the children held hands and danced in circles. Musicians and writers also sang and danced with the children. The children spent the first evening of their summer vacation in this beautiful night.

    在营火旁“迎接快乐的暑假”
    新华社记者　孙世恺
    七月十四日傍晚，刚落过一阵小雨，首都街头一片清新。二千多名孩子怀着愉快的心情，穿着节日的新衣，成群结队地从四面八方奔向北京市第二十五中学体育场。绿色的草地上坐着一队队少年先锋队员。他们都是来参加“迎接快乐的暑假”营火会的。今年“五一”劳动节给毛主席献花的九岁小女孩东单区中心小学少年先锋队员王光如出现了，成群的孩子立刻围上来。中国人民解放军某部战斗英雄吴振国、音乐家马可、儿童剧“果园姐妹”的作者乔羽、儿童话剧“作一个好队员”的作者王命夫、陈正等这些为孩子们热爱的文艺工作者也赶来祝贺。
    八时，营火会的小主席，去年国庆节给毛主席献花的培元小学少年先锋队员张筠英宣布开会。会场立即由欢腾转入宁静。她代表首都千万个幸福的孩子讲话，最后她说：让我们围着营火痛痛快快地跳舞，渡过这幸福的美丽的夜晚吧！这时，一群带着红领巾的孩子随着被邀前来参加营火会的中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会总参谋部军乐团的叔叔们奏起的轻盈的乐曲齐声歌唱：营火烧起来了，我们的歌声飞扬，我们的笑声飞扬，……五个孩子举着火把请他们喜爱的音乐家、作家和中国新民主主义青年团北京市委员会少年儿童部的代表等点燃营火。
    在熊熊的营火旁，孩子们尽情地歌舞。西单区第一中心小学四十多名少年先锋队队员合唱了“我们的节日”、“我们快乐的歌唱”等，北京师范大学附属第二小学学生吉敬易朗诵了作家袁鹰为孩子新作的诗篇“快乐的暑假”。打扮成少数民族美丽的姑娘模样的九个小女孩翩翩舞起“歌唱毛主席”的舞蹈。当西单区第一中心小学表演完优美的“雁舞”后，小主席兴奋地喊：报告大家一个好消息！“月亮姑娘”和“小星星”也来参加咱们的晚会了。顿时全场响起狂热的掌声，从明亮的营火旁果真出现了美丽的“月亮姑娘”和“小星星”，她们是由中国少年儿童剧团的两个小演员装扮的。“小星星”用爽朗的声调向孩子们说：你们欢迎我和月亮姐姐来参加你们的营火会吗？话音还没落地，对面的一群孩子高声答话：“欢迎！”成群的孩子一涌上去拉着“月亮姑娘”和“小星星”一起歌舞起来。
    远处吹来的微风，把营火煽得越来越旺。火光照红了孩子们的脸。军乐团又奏起轻快的舞曲，孩子们手拉着手团团的跳起舞来。音乐家和作家们也和孩子们一起歌舞。孩子们在这美丽的夜里，渡过了今年暑期生活中头一个晚会。
