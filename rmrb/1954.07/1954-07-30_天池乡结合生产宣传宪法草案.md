    Tianchi Township Combines Production with Propaganda of the Draft Constitution
    Sichuan Provincial Draft Constitution Discussion Committee Office
    In order to gain experience in publicizing the Draft Constitution to the masses, the Party and government leading organs of Yibin Special District and Yibin City in Sichuan Province jointly organized a work group to conduct a typical trial in Tianchi Township, a suburb of Yibin City.

    The propaganda work of the Draft Constitution in Tianchi Township was carried out in conjunction with current production and the establishment of agricultural producers' cooperatives. Most of the masses in the township have a general understanding of the spirit and essence of the Draft Constitution. According to statistics from Zhongxing and Liyuan villages in the township, this type of farmer household has reached 94% of the total number of farmer households. After extensive and thorough publicity, the political consciousness of cadres and the masses in the township has been generally improved, their enthusiasm for production has been boosted, and the mutual aid and cooperation movement has been promoted.

    The reason why the propaganda work in Tianchi Township has achieved relatively good results is that it first grasped the close integration with current production. After a special study by the township Party branch, on the one hand, it put forward specific slogans such as "Support the Draft Constitution and launch a summer manure accumulation campaign" and "Support the Draft Constitution and further eliminate barnyard grass and control borers." On the other hand, it paid attention to understanding the ideological problems of the masses in current production. Then, in response to these ideologies, it deeply educated the masses to welcome the Draft Constitution with practical actions to improve production. For example, regarding the issue of manure accumulation, some cadres and activists believed that fertilizer was "accumulated every year" and that "it was still early." On the issue of eliminating barnyard grass and controlling borers, cadres were satisfied with the achievements already made, and the masses also felt that "it was almost done." Based on these situations, the work group combined the propaganda of the Draft Constitution with specific explanations of the resolutions of the township People's Congress, publicized the significance of launching a summer manure accumulation campaign and continuing to eliminate barnyard grass and control borers, and used examples such as the repair of ponds in Liyuan Village in the township to educate the masses. After this, the whole township launched a manure accumulation campaign and continued to eliminate barnyard grass and control borers. Some farmers went to the fields on rainy days to pull barnyard grass and block gaps. Cadres in Zhonghe and other villages in the township began to deliberate on how to repair ponds.

    Secondly, it was carried out in conjunction with the establishment of agricultural producers' cooperatives. At the beginning, the Draft Constitution propaganda work group and the cooperative establishment work group each did their own thing, emphasizing the importance of their respective work. One asked him to participate in discussions on handling membership issues, and the other asked him to participate in Draft Constitution discussion meetings, making it difficult for cadres and activists to know which way to go. As a result, neither the propaganda of the Draft Constitution nor the establishment of agricultural producers' cooperatives was done well. In response to this situation, on the one hand, the two work groups unified their thinking and understanding and consulted with each other; on the other hand, they immediately convened a meeting of the township Party branch to study how to combine leadership and formulate principles for the combination: the propaganda of the Draft Constitution should not affect the progress of the work of establishing agricultural producers' cooperatives, but both parties have the responsibility to cooperate with each other. In areas where agricultural producers' cooperatives are being established, slogans such as "Support the Draft Constitution and actively participate in agricultural producers' cooperatives" were put forward, and unified arrangements were made through administrative channels. Two methods were also adopted in the combination: one was to jointly arrange the time for propaganda and meetings; the other was to combine the propaganda content and discussion content. For example, Tianchi Agricultural Producers' Cooperative in the township was just starting to be established, and some people had various concerns in their minds after hearing rumors from bad elements. Therefore, it was specifically pointed out in the propaganda: the Draft Constitution stipulates that joining the cooperative is voluntary, and the state helps farmers take the road of collectivization, and vigorously publicizes the superiority of Huangjueping Agricultural Producers' Cooperative. This solved the ideological problems of some people. The combination of establishing agricultural producers' cooperatives and propagating the Draft Constitution not only helped each other, but also understood each other's situations and provided opinions. As a result, the propaganda of the Draft Constitution gradually deepened, and the work of establishing agricultural producers' cooperatives was also promoted.

    Mobilizing and continuously cultivating propaganda backbones has enabled the propaganda of the Draft Constitution to be widely carried out and gradually deepened. At the beginning of the Draft Constitution propaganda, the Tianchi Township Party Branch organized 46 propaganda backbones to study, and absorbed 23 activists to participate in the township People's Congress, totaling more than 70 propaganda backbones, with an average of one to three propaganda backbones in each residential group. Before they publicized to the masses and led the masses to study, they listened to three to four reports and went through two or three serious discussions. Generally, they had the ability to publicize to the masses. Full-scale publicity began after the propaganda backbones were trained, and assistance and training were continuously given during the propaganda process. In addition to actively organizing the masses to study, discuss, and promptly reflect the situation, they could also actively think of ways to guide the discussion to gradually deepen. Li Zuorong and Tang Jinsheng, propaganda backbones in Zhonghe Village, used vivid facts to compare and enlighten everyone when leading the group discussion on why the constitution should be formulated, so that the masses realized the relationship between the Draft Constitution and each individual.

    Tianchi Township also paid attention to the following points when conducting reports on the Draft Constitution: First, the content of the report must be targeted at the farmers' thinking and closely combined with the farmers' own interests so that the farmers can accept it. After listening to the report, farmer Li Shaoshan suddenly realized and said: "I didn't know where the seals and guns came from after I was liberated. Now I know that it was because of the leadership of the Communist Party and the working class that we farmers and workers came together to be masters of our own affairs. This must be included in the constitution." Farmer Cao Yuzhen said: "The Draft Constitution points out the way forward for us. Everyone should unite closely and move towards socialism."

    Second, in the report, key points should be clearly explained according to the actual situation. When explaining the necessity of transforming individual agriculture, it is necessary to repeatedly explain the road of transformation and the policies of the state, and explain that the state helps and encourages everyone to develop cooperative economy. At the same time, it should be explained that the state protects the land ownership and other property rights of farmers in accordance with the law, precisely to encourage everyone to organize, improve their awareness, and gradually change and get rid of the circle of small-scale peasant economy. It should also be explained that "protecting in accordance with the law" and "transforming" are not contradictory. After hearing this, middle peasant Cao Zebo nodded and said: "The Draft Constitution stipulates that our interests are protected in accordance with the law in order to encourage us to engage in mutual aid and cooperation. I will definitely work hard in the mutual aid group and strive to join the cooperative when it is established." When explaining "Citizens have the right to education" and "The state establishes and gradually expands various schools and other cultural and educational institutions to guarantee citizens' enjoyment of this right," it is necessary to address the current ideological problems of junior and senior primary school graduates participating in labor production, explain the situation of the people's government actively developing people's education in the past four years, explain the educational nature of primary and junior high schools, and explain that "gradually" means that the improvement of cultural level must be subordinate to the development of production. Explaining that labor is a glorious thing for citizens should be combined with criticizing some erroneous understandings. After listening to the report, student Zeng Zhongfu said: "The working people study to improve production. I should respond to the call to participate in labor production."

    Third, the method of comparative education must be used to enlighten farmers. This is an effective educational method. Once, when discussing citizens' personal freedom, everyone connected it with the past. Farmer Yang Dequan said: "Before liberation, I saw with my own eyes that strong young men who could still eat were buried alive because the laws at that time only protected a few bureaucrats and landlords to exploit us. But now every article in the Draft Constitution is good for us, because we are the masters of our own affairs. I will take the lead in everything in the future."

    Fourth, attention should be paid to mobilizing women according to their characteristics. The cultural level of rural women in general is relatively low, and their understanding of issues is relatively poor. Therefore, the significance of equality between men and women should be emphasized to women in the report. This will give women a kind of strength and increase their enthusiasm. In the past, only 10 or 20 people attended women's meetings in Tianchi Village, but this time, more than 40 people came. Not only did they actively study the Draft Constitution themselves, but they also publicized it everywhere.

    天池乡结合生产宣传宪法草案
    四川省宪法草案讨论委员会办公室
    四川宜宾专区和宜宾市党、政领导机关，为了取得向群众宣传宪法草案的经验，联合组织了工作组到宜宾市郊天池乡进行典型试办。
    天池乡的宪法草案宣传工作，是和当前生产和建立农业生产合作社工作结合进行的。该乡大部分群众对宪法草案的精神实质，都有了一个概括的认识。据该乡中兴、梨元两村统计，这一类农户已达总农户的百分之九十四。经过大张旗鼓、深入细致的宣传以后，该乡干部和群众的政治觉悟普遍有了提高，生产热情得到鼓舞，也推进了互助合作运动。
    天池乡的宣传工作，所以获得比较好的成绩，首先掌握了密切结合当前生产。经过该乡党支部专门研究以后，一面提出“拥护宪法草案，开展夏季积肥运动”、“拥护宪法草案，进一步除稗治螟”等具体口号，一面注意了解群众在当前生产中的思想问题。然后针对思想，深入教育群众用搞好生产的实际行动来欢迎宪法草案。如积肥问题，有些干部和积极分子认为肥料是“年年积到的”，“时间还早”；在除稗治螟问题上，干部满足于已经得到的成绩，群众也认为“已经搞得差不多了。”根据这些情况，工作组便结合宪法草案宣传具体解释乡人民代表大会会议决议，宣传开展夏季积肥运动和继续除稗治螟的意义，并用该乡梨元村修塘等事例教育群众。这以后，全乡就展开了积肥运动和继续除稗治螟的工作。有些农民在雨天到地里扯稗子、堵缺口。该乡中和等村的干部，开始酝酿如何修塘。
    其次，和建立农业生产合作社工作结合进行。开始时，宪法草案宣传工作组搞一套，建社工作组搞一套，各自强调工作的重要；你叫他去参加处理入社问题的讨论会，我叫他去参加宪法草案讨论会，干部和积极分子弄得不知走那头好。结果，宪法草案的宣传和建立农业生产合作社两件工作都没有搞好。针对这种情况，一面由工作组双方统一思想认识，互相商量；一面立即召开乡党支部会研究如何结合领导，订出结合的原则：宪法草案宣传不能影响建立农业生产合作社工作的进行，但双方都有责任互相配合。正在建立农业生产合作社的地区，提出“拥护宪法草案，积极参加农业生产合作社”等口号，并通过行政统一布置。在结合中还采取了两种方法：一种是共同安排宣传和开会的时间；一种是在宣传内容、讨论内容上结合进行，如该乡天池农业生产合作社正开始建立，有些群众听了坏分子的谣言，心中产生种种顾虑，于是在宣传中特别提出：宪法草案规定入社是自愿的，国家帮助农民走合作化道路，并大力宣传黄桷坪农业生产合作社的优越性。这就解决了一些人的思想问题。建立农业生产合作社和宪法草案宣传结合起来了，两方面的同志不但互相帮助，而且互相了解情况，提供意见。宪法草案宣传因而逐步深入，建立农业生产合作社工作也推进了。
    动员和不断培养宣传骨干，使宪法草案宣传广泛开展并逐步深入。宪法草案宣传一开始，天池乡党支部组织宣传骨干四十六人进行学习，召开乡人民代表大会会议时又吸收了积极分子二十三人参加，前后共计培养了宣传骨干七十多人，平均每个居民小组有一到三个宣传骨干。他们在向群众宣传、领导群众学习以前，都听了三到四次报告，经过了二、三次认真的讨论。一般都有了向群众宣传的能力。全面展开宣传是在培养了宣传骨干以后开始的，在宣传过程中又不断给以帮助和培养。他们除积极组织群众学习、讨论和及时反映情况外，还能主动想办法引导讨论逐步走向深入。该乡中和村宣传骨干李作容、唐金盛在领导小组讨论为啥要制定宪法时，用生动的事实来对比、启发大家，使群众认识到宪法草案对每个人的关系。
    天池乡在进行关于宪法草案的报告时，还注意下面几点：第一，报告内容必须针对农民思想，和农民的切身利益密切结合，使农民能接受。农民李绍山听了报告以后，恍然大悟地说：“以前我翻了身，还不知印把子、枪杆子从那里来的，现在才知道是有了共产党和工人阶级的领导，我们农民和工人一起当家作主得来的。这一定要订在宪法里才行。”农民曹玉珍说：“宪法草案给指出了我们前进的路，大家要团结紧，朝社会主义走。”
    第二，在报告中，重点地方应该根据实际情况解释清楚。说明改造个体农业的必要性时，必须反复讲清改造的道路、国家的政策，说明国家帮助和鼓励大家发展合作社经济。同时说明，国家依照法律保护农民的土地所有权和其他财产所有权，正是为了鼓励大家组织起来，提高觉悟，逐步改变，摆脱小农经济的圈圈。还应该说明“依照法律保护”和“改造”是没有矛盾的。中农曹泽波听到以后，点头说道：“宪法草案上订上了依照法律保护我们的利益，是为了鼓励我们搞互助合作，我一定在互助组里好好干，争取办社时入社。”解释“公民有受教育的权利”、“国家设立并且逐步扩大各种学校和其他文化教育机关，以保证公民享受这种权利。”时，必须针对当前初中、高小毕业生参加劳动生产中的思想问题，讲清人民政府四年来积极发展人民教育事业的情况，讲清小学、初中的教育性质，讲清“逐步”就是指文化水平的提高必须服从生产的发展。讲清劳动是公民的光荣事情，结合批判一些错误认识。学生曾仲福听了报告以后说：“劳动人民读书是为了搞好生产，我应该响应参加劳动生产的号召。”
    第三，必须运用对比教育的方法启发农民。这是一种有效的教育方法，有一次讨论关于公民的人身自由时，大家都联系过去，农民杨德全说：“解放前我亲眼见过，还吃得饭的壮丁就被活埋，因为那时的法律只保护少数官僚、地主来剥削我们。而现在宪法草案上条条对我们有好处，就因为我们当家作主了。以后我啥子都要带头干。”
    第四，应该按照妇女特点，重视发动妇女。一般农村妇女的文化程度比较低，认识问题比较差。所以在报告中要着重对妇女讲清男女平等的意义。这样就会给妇女一种力量，使她们的积极性提高。该乡天池村开妇女会一向只有一、二十人，这次，一来就有四十多人。她们不但自己积极学习宪法草案，并且到处进行宣传。
