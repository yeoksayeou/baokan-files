Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, July 8th: The Second International Conference of Metal and Machine Workers has concluded.

    At the closing session, congratulatory telegrams from many countries were read.

    The conference sent a telegram to the Greek unified trade union movement, condemning the Bevegos government's persecution of outstanding representatives of the Greek working class and demanding democratic and trade union rights.

    The conference passed a telegram of tribute to the metal workers of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, which was greeted with enthusiastic applause.

    The conference also passed a telegram to the people of Guatemala, protesting against the aggression instigated by American imperialism.

    The delegates adopted amendments to the international statutes of the Metal and Machine Workers' Trade Unions. The conference also sent a telegram to the Supreme Court of Japan and Prime Minister Yoshida protesting against the judgment against Japanese railway workers related to the so-called "Matsukawa Incident."

    The conference unanimously adopted a socio-economic program (the program lists the basic demands of metal and machine industry workers), general resolutions on the first and second agenda items, and resolutions on the third agenda item of the conference.

    The resolution on unemployment stipulated several measures to eliminate the growing unemployment in capitalist countries: generally increasing wages to increase purchasing power and expand the internal market; rapidly developing international trade on a mutually beneficial basis, eliminating barriers to East-West trade; developing the economies of backward countries, and so on.

    The conference adopted a resolution emphasizing the need to intensify opposition to the "European Coal and Steel Community," which is transforming the steel industries of its six member states into arsenals for the aggressive "European Defense Community."

    The conference unanimously adopted a letter to metal and machine workers and an open letter to trade union organizations and working people who did not participate in the Metal and Machine Workers' Trade Unions International.

    Based on the suggestion of Bredou (France), the conference elected the new Administrative Committee of the Metal and Machine Workers' Trade Unions International. Those elected to the Administrative Committee included: Rovida (Italy), Marcel Bra (formerly translated as Marcel Brax, France), Yefanov (Soviet Union), Zhao Guoqiang (People's Republic of China), Berg (Germany), Martins (Brazil), Kovacs (Romania), Tihak (formerly translated as Sihak, Czechoslovakia), and others.
