    South Siberian Railway Main Line
    By S. Borisov, Soviet Union
    The roar of the speeding train has just faded away, and in the distance comes the long whistle of the locomotive – train after train, loaded with coal, minerals, timber, grain, and wool, rushes along the Siberian mainline. The freight intensity of this railway line exceeds that of some of the most active railway mainlines in the world. The freight volume of just the Omsk and Tomsk sections of the line is equivalent to the total railway freight volume of the United Kingdom, Belgium, the Netherlands, Japan, and Turkey. However, the Siberian Grand Trunk Railway still cannot fully meet the requirements of the Soviet national economy. The continuous increase in freight transport requires the construction of another trans-Siberian mainline.

    Now, this second Siberian mainline, except for the Abakan-Stalinsk section, has been completed. The new mainline starts from the city of Abakan in the southern part of the Krasnoyarsk Krai, passes through the Kuznetsk coal mining base to Stalinsk, and from there enters Barnaul, the administrative center of the Altai Krai, then crosses the Kulunda Steppe and the Pavlodar and Akmolinsk provinces of the Kazakh Republic, passes through the Kartaly station, and ends at Magnitogorsk.

    This new railway is over two thousand kilometers long and connects the Urals and the Kuznetsk coal mining base with the shortest route. It will greatly share the burden of the original Siberian Grand Trunk Railway. This is one of the main purposes of building this railway. At the same time, the South Siberian mainline is also a powerful lever for further developing the productive forces of the eastern regions of the Soviet state. From this point of view, each section of the mainline plays a significant role.

    The construction of the Abakan-Stalinsk section (two-thirds of which has now been completed) will increase the mining volume of iron ore in Abakan, Teysk, Irbinsk, and other mines. At the same time, this section will make the mining work in many coal and manganese ore producing areas more intensive, and the logging industry in the upper reaches of the Tom River will expand day by day. The completion of the Barnaul to Kulunda section will enable the chemical industry in the base (Kulunda Lake), which is rich in raw materials for manufacturing soda and other chemicals, to develop rapidly. In addition, this route will serve the granary of Siberia – the Kulunda Steppe, and can greatly shorten the distance of grain transportation. The completion of the Pavlodar to Akmolinsk section will also reduce the burden of mining operations in the Boschekul copper mining area and the Ekibastuz coal mining area. And the completion of the Akmolinsk to Kartaly section will enable coal from Karaganda to be transported to Magnitogorsk via the shortest route, and at the same time, it will play a huge role in developing agriculture in the nearby areas.

    The South Siberian mainline was originally started in 1939. After a few years, by 1942, the construction workers had opened up the main section of the mainline – Akmolinsk to Kartaly – with a length of 806 kilometers. In 1941, the construction of other sections of the mainline – the Pavlodar to Akmolinsk section and the Stalinsk to Barnaul section – had already begun, but the construction work was suspended due to the start of the Great Patriotic War.

    After the war, the construction workers returned to the South Siberian mainline construction site. In 1952, regular line opening work was carried out on the Aldeshta to Altai section. This section of the route is not long – only two hundred kilometers in total. However, it must pass through many extremely complex and rugged mountainous areas. Therefore, the construction workers had to use mountain blasting explosives repeatedly.

    Once, in a desolate place, a violent explosion resounded – 500,000 kilograms of explosives lifted a huge hill high into the air, forming a deep gap half a kilometer long. What two hundred excavators needed five months to do was completed in a few seconds.

    Construction workers reappeared on the construction site of the Pavlodar to Akmolinsk section. They overcame many difficulties in their work. Although most of the railway line passes through grasslands and flat areas, the construction work encountered many difficulties due to deeply hidden aquifer and the presence of clay layers and some loose soil sections. Moreover, this route must also pass through mountainous areas.

    Hydraulic workers completed unusually arduous and complex work. Providing water to the residential areas and technical centers of the new route was a very complex problem. Because in these areas through which the new line passes, there are few surface ponds and fixed sources of groundwater. Therefore, in water-scarce areas, huge dams and main conduits had to be built to store rainwater and snowmelt from the spring floods. Thus, artificial reservoirs with a capacity of one million cubic meters of water and waterways tens of kilometers long were established.

    It would not be possible to complete such a large-scale construction project without powerful mechanical equipment. The Soviet government supplied the construction workers with the latest domestic technology and equipment. There are various types of earth-moving machines on the construction site, from light graders and excavators to various brands of excavating machines. Powerful cranes and track-laying machines were used in the work of laying the tracks. The process of pouring concrete and other heavy labor was almost entirely mechanized.

    Construction workers and mechanical workers have quickly mastered these complete technical equipment, and have been able to skillfully operate them, and have also fully exploited the potential power of these equipment.

    At the beginning of the construction project, excavator operators competed with each other to successfully overfulfill the average annual progress quota, and later they launched a campaign to complete two years' quota within one year. The advanced excavator team led by Ya. Sukur and the famous mechanic of the Stalingrad Hydroelectric Power Station, the Hero of Socialist Labor D. Sliebukho, competed with each other. Sukur and his comrades fully utilized the power of their steam excavators and almost overfulfilled their annual task by one and a half times.

    Due to the use of various construction technical equipment with high production efficiency, earthwork, loading ballast, spreading ballast, and pouring concrete were almost completely mechanized. The degree of mechanization greatly exceeded the level specified in the plan.

    In February 1952, the construction workers laid the last few sections of the railway, completing approximately 11 million cubic meters of earthwork. Just to pass through the Yermintausk Mountains, it was necessary to excavate more than 1.5 million square meters of rock and remove it from the route. The construction workers built 198 artificial structures and opened up 35,000 square meters of residential area. Now trains can travel along the entire 438-kilometer railway.

    At the same time, in some places towards the eastern region, the Barnaul to Kulunda section has begun to be built. The start of this construction project was different from usual. People came to the construction site with their own homes – complete sets of clapboard houses. In the snowy grassland, many construction worker villages were built within a few weeks, and clubs, restaurants, shops, bathrooms, and medical stations were established. This saved a lot of time. People can immediately devote themselves to the main work. The construction project immediately unfolded in full swing. The grassland was filled day and night with the sounds of diesel engines of power stations, the horns of cars, and the rotation of band saws. The excavator pierced the ground, leaving behind the roadbed and the newly opened gap. Following it was the grader; the grader, driven by a tractor, cut the uneven ground flat, and then the heavy iron rollers pressed the ground flat. After that, it was the turn of the paving workers to work. They lifted sections of rails nailed with sleepers from the ground and carefully placed them on the paved roadbed. Immediately afterwards, the track-laying machine carried out the work of laying ballast on the rails. In this area, 40 excavators and 500 cars were working day and night. Dozens of fixed power stations and mobile power stations supply electricity to various machines and equipment. The bridges along the line were also built quickly. The bridges are built with ready-made complete materials – two giant I-beams. After the construction workers built the piers, they only needed to put the pre-prepared I-beams on them. The bridge can be erected in four to eight hours, depending on the size of the bridge. Mechanized methods were also widely used in building houses.

    Twenty-two months after the start of construction, the construction workers held a grand celebration of the completion of the construction project. A 343-kilometer route has entered the stage of regular opening. A total of 400 million cubic meters of earth were excavated at the construction site, 95 artificial structures were built, 800 meters of trunk line routes and station sidings were laid, 800,000 cubic meters of ballast were collected, transported, and laid, and hundreds of houses and offices and workshops were built.

    Participating in the construction of the Barnaul to Kulunda section of the railway can be said to be entering a large technical school for all the construction workers. In 1953 alone, 650 construction workers mastered various specialized technologies, 300 people improved their technical proficiency, and 150 people completed production technical training courses. Dozens of people have also learned two or three specialized businesses and have become comprehensive specialists.

    The most important part of the South Siberian mainline has been completed. From now on, the Urals and the Kuznetsk coal mining base have been connected with the shortest route: direct traffic from Stalinsk to Magnitogorsk has begun to run. Freight cars, full of timber, coal, minerals, and grain produced in the vast land of Siberia, are running along the new mainline. Near the newly opened station, the overhead of the excavator stands tall, and various warehouses are also under construction. Railway employees are preparing to welcome new harvests. Timber harvesting workers built timber transportation roads leading to the railway, transporting valuable timber from the large forest area. Various industrial enterprises are also being established and developed at the same time. New residential areas have also been established near the railway line. Busy and intense life is boiling on one of the largest new projects in the Soviet Union's Fifth Five-Year Plan – the South Siberian mainline.

    南西伯利亚铁路干线
    苏联　斯·鲍利索夫
    急驰而过的火车的喧嚷声刚刚消失，远处又传来了机车的漫长的鸣叫声——列车装载着煤炭、矿物、木材、粮食和羊毛一列接着一列地沿着西伯利亚干线飞奔着。这条铁路线的货运强度超过了世界上最活跃的一些铁路干线。仅该线中的鄂木斯克和托姆斯克两段，其货物运转量就相当于英国、比利时、荷兰、日本和土耳其的全部的铁路货运量。可是，西伯利亚大干线仍不能完全满足苏联国民经济的要求。大批货运的不断增加，需要在西伯利亚再修建一条横贯的干线。
    现在，这第二条西伯利亚干线，除阿巴根至斯大林斯克一段外，都已修成了。新干线以克拉斯诺雅尔斯克边区南部的阿巴根城为起点，通过库兹涅茨煤矿基地到达斯大林斯克，再由此进入阿尔泰边区的行政中心巴尔瑙尔，然后越过库伦琴草原和哈萨克共和国的帕福洛达尔省和阿克摩林斯克省，经过卡尔塔来车站，而以马格尼托哥尔斯克为终点。
    这条新的铁路全长二千余公里，以最短的路线把乌拉尔和库兹涅茨煤矿基地联接起来。它将大大地分担原有的西伯利亚大干线的负担。这就是修建这条铁路的主要目的之一。同时，南西伯利亚干线也是进一步发展苏维埃国家东部地区生产力的强有力的杠杆。从这个观点来看，干线中的每一段都起着重大的作用。
    修建阿巴根至斯大林斯克一段（现已建成三分之二），将使阿巴根、节伊斯克、伊尔宾斯克和其他矿山的铁矿的采掘量增高。同时，这一段将使许多煤矿和锰矿产地的采掘工作更加紧张，托姆河上游的伐木业日益扩展。巴尔瑙尔到库伦特一段的建成，将使盛产制造苏打和其他化学品原料的基地
  （库伦琴湖）的化学工业，得以迅速发展。此外，这条路线将为西伯利亚的谷仓——库伦琴草原服务，并可大大地缩短粮食运转的距离。帕福洛达尔到阿克摩林斯克一段的建成，也将会减轻铜矿产地之一——鲍歇库尔矿区，以及厄基巴斯杜兹矿区的煤矿的开采工作的负担。而阿克摩林斯克到卡尔塔来一段的建成，使卡拉干达的煤得以通过最短的途径运往马格尼托哥尔斯克，同时在发展附近地区的农业方面也将起着巨大的作用。
    南西伯利亚干线原于一九三九年开始修筑。经过了几年，至一九四二年时，建筑工人们已开拓了这条干线的主要的一段——阿克摩林斯克到卡尔塔来——长达八百零六公里。一九四一年修建干线中的其他几段——帕福洛达尔到阿克摩林斯克段及斯大林斯克到巴尔瑙尔段的建筑工程，都已开始动工，但建筑工程因伟大卫国战争的开始而中止。
    战争结束后，建筑工人们重新来到了南西伯利亚干线工地。一九五二年进行了阿尔德什塔到阿尔泰段的经常性的线路开拓工作。这一段路线并不长——总共只有二百公里。但是它必须通过许多极其复杂和崎岖不平的多山地区。因此，建筑工人们不得不屡次使用开山炸药。
    有一次在荒无人烟的地方轰然发出了剧烈的爆炸声——五十万公斤的炸药把一个巨大的丘陵高高地掀起来了，而组成了一个长达半公里的深豁口。几秒钟内就完成了二百个掘土工人需要五个月才能做完的工作。
    建筑工人们又重新出现于帕福洛达尔到阿克摩林斯克一段的工地上。他们在自己的工作中克服了重重困难。虽然这条铁路线所通过的大部分是草原地带和平坦的地区，但是由于深深潜伏着含水地层和由于粘土层和一些土壤松弛地段的存在，使建筑工程遭到了很多困难。而且这条路线还必须通过多山地带。
    水利工作人员完成了异常艰巨和复杂的工作。对新路线的居民区和技术中心站进行供水工作，是
  一个很复杂的问题。因为在新线所通过的这些地带，很少有地面池塘和固定的地下水的泉源。因此在缺水的地段不得不建筑巨大的堰堤和主导管以贮存春季泛滥的雨水和雪水。于是可容水一百万立方公尺的人工贮水池和长达数十公里的水道便因此而建立起来了。
    建成这样巨大规模的建筑工程，如果没有强大的机械设备是不可能的。苏联政府以最新的本国技术装备供给建筑工人们。在工地上有各式的掘土机器，自轻型的平路机、掘土机起，到各种牌号的掘凿机止。在铺设轨道的工作中，使用了威力强大的起重机和铺轨联动机。灌浇混凝土和其他需要繁重劳动的过程，几乎全部是机械化的。
    建筑工人和机械工作人员们都已很快地掌握了这些完备的技术设备，并已经能够熟练地来操纵它们，同时也充分地发掘了这些设备的潜在力量。
    在建筑工程开始时，掘凿机手们曾互相进行了顺利超额完成一年平均进度定额的竞赛，后来他们又展开了在一年之内完成两年定额的运动。由雅·苏库尔所领导的先进的掘凿机工作队和斯大林格勒水电站的著名机械师、社会主义劳动英雄德·斯列布霍进行了竞赛。苏库尔和他的同志们，充分地发挥了自己的蒸气掘凿机的威力，几乎超额完成自己的全年任务的一倍半。
    由于使用了具有高度生产效力的各种建筑技术设备，土方工程、装载道渣、铺敷道渣和灌浇混凝土的工作几乎完全机械化了。机械化的程度大大地超过了计划中所规定的水平。
      一九五二年二月，建筑工人们铺设了这条铁路的最后几段铁路，完成了约一千一百万立方公尺的土方工程。仅仅为了通过叶尔明塔乌斯克山地，就不得不把一百五十万平方公尺以上的山岩掘开并把它从路线上清除出去。建筑工人们建筑了一百九十八个人工建筑物，开拓了三万五千平方公尺的住宅面积。现在火车已经可以沿着全长四百三十八公里的铁路行驶着。
    同时在偏向东部地区一些的地方，已开始建筑巴尔瑙尔到库伦特这一段。这一建筑工程开始时，和平常不一样。人们带着自己的住宅——整套的夹板房，来到了工地。在积雪的草原上，几星期内就兴建起来了许多建筑工人村，并设立了俱乐部、餐厅、商店、浴室、医疗站。这样便节省了很多时间。人们可以马上投入主要的工作中去。建筑工程立刻全面地展开起来。草原上日夜不停地响彻着电力站柴油发动机的格?格?的响声，汽车的喇叭声和带锯的转动声。掘凿机穿凿着地面，留在后面的是路基和刚刚凿开的豁口。紧跟着它后面的是平土机；平土机由牵引机推动着把不平整的地面切平，然后由沉重的铁滚子把地面压得平平坦坦的。此后，该轮到铺道工人来工作了。他们把一段段钉上了枕木的铁轨，由地面上轻轻抬起，小心翼翼地把它放在已铺好的路基上。紧接着便是铺轨机器来进行路轨敷设道渣的工作。在这一地带有四十部掘凿机和五百部汽车昼夜不停地工作着。数十座固定电力站和流动电力站供给各种各样的机器设备以电力。沿线的桥梁也迅速地建筑起来了。桥梁是用现成的整套材料——两段巨型的工字架筑成的。建筑工人们在建好桥墩以后，只需要把事先准备好的工字架放上去就行了。桥梁可以在四至八个小时内架好，需时的长短要看桥的大小而决定。在建筑房屋时也广泛地采用了机械化的方法。
    开工以后过了二十二个月，建筑工人们举行了一次盛大的庆祝建筑工程竣工大会。长达三百四十三公里的路线已进入经常开拓的阶段。在工地上总共掘土四亿立方公尺，修建了九十五个人工建筑物、铺筑了八百公尺的干线路线和站内支线，采集、运送和铺设了八十万立方公尺的道渣，修建了数百间住宅和办公室与工房。
    参加建筑巴尔瑙尔到库伦特一段铁路线，对于所有的建筑工人们说来，可以说是进入了一座大的技术学校。仅在一九五三年间掌握了各种专门技术的建筑工人就有六百五十人，提高了技术熟练程度的有三百人，修完了生产技术训练班的有一百五十人。还有几十个人已学习了两三种专门业务，成了全面的专门人才。
    南西伯利亚干线的最重要的部分已完工。从现在起，从乌拉尔到库兹涅茨煤矿基地已用最短的路线联络起来了：斯大林斯克到马格尼托哥尔斯克的直达通车已开始行驶。货车满载着西伯利亚辽阔的土地所盛产的木材、煤炭、矿物和粮食，沿着新的干线奔驰着。在新开辟的车站的附近，耸立着掘凿机的高架，各种仓库也正在建筑中，铁路员工正在准备迎接新的收获物。木材采伐工人们建筑了通向铁路的木材运输道，把珍贵的木材从大森林区运出来。各种工业企业也同时在建立和发展中。铁路线附近新的居民区也建立起来了。在苏联第五个五年计划中的最大的新工程之一——南西伯利亚干线上，繁忙而紧张的生活正在沸腾着。
