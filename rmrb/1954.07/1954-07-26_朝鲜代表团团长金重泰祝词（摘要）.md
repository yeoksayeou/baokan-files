Kim Chung-tae, head of the Korean Cooperative Delegation, delivered a congratulatory speech at the First Congress of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives. He said: Entrusted by the Central Committees of the Korean Consumer Cooperative, the Korean Production Cooperative, and the Korean Fisheries Cooperative, I extend brotherly and warm congratulations to the First Congress of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives.

He described the friendship forged in blood between the people of Korea and China. He particularly pointed out that the most outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people—the Chinese People's Volunteers and technicians—have created brilliant achievements on the labor front of reconstructing Korea. He then said: On the railways and bridges restored by the Korean people and the Chinese People's Volunteers, trains sent to us by the Chinese people have already begun to speed. The tremendous assistance from our fraternal Chinese people, together with the assistance from the great Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries, has become a major guarantee for defeating the enemy and has greatly inspired the Korean people who are fighting to complete and overfulfill the Three-Year Plan for the restoration of the post-war national economy.

He said: The All-China Federation of Cooperatives has become a powerful assistant to state-owned commerce in supplying the working people with production and living materials and carrying out the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas. In organizing cooperative members, based on the principle of voluntarism, it has used various methods and practical examples to demonstrate the superiority of the collective economy, educated individual small producers, made them realize the superiority of the cooperative economy, and encouraged them to voluntarily participate in the cooperative for the country's socialist construction and to improve their own living standards. Therefore, it has truly become a mass economy and has been trusted and respected by the Chinese people.

He said: The glorious path taken by the All-China Federation of Cooperatives is not only a great achievement in socialist construction in China but will also provide valuable experience for the Korean cooperative movement and serve as a good example to learn from.

Finally, Kim Chung-tae said: The Korean cooperatives further believe that you are one of the most reliable friends. They will use all their strength to protect the solidarity and friendship between the people of Korea and China and the people's democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union, like protecting their own eyes. Any conspiracy that attempts to undermine our just cause cannot prevent us from moving towards victory.

    朝鲜代表团团长金重泰祝词（摘要）
    朝鲜合作社代表团团长金重泰在中华全国合作社第一次代表大会上致祝词，他说：我受朝鲜消费合作社、朝鲜生产合作社及朝鲜水产合作社中央委员会的委托，向中华全国合作社第一次代表大会致兄弟般的热烈的祝贺。
    他叙述了朝中人民用鲜血结成的友谊。他特别指出，中国人民最优秀的儿女——中国人民志愿军和技术人员，在重建朝鲜的劳动战线上，创造了光辉的事迹。接着他说：在朝鲜人民和中国人民志愿军所恢复起来的铁路和桥梁上，已开始飞驰着中国人民送给我们的火车了。兄弟般的中国人民如此巨大的援助和以伟大的苏联为首的各人民民主国家的援助一道，成为了战胜敌人的主要保证，并极大地鼓舞了为完成和超额完成恢复战后国民经济三年计划而奋起斗争的朝鲜人民。
    他说：中华全国合作社联合总社在供应劳动人民生产和生活资料，开展城乡物资交流的事业上成为了国营商业的有力助手。在组织合作社社员的工作中，根据自愿原则，以各种方法和实际例子证明了集体经济的优越性，教育了个体小生产者，使他们认识到合作社经济的优越性，为国家的社会主义建设和提高自己的生活水平，自愿地参加了合作社。因此它真正成为群众经济并受到了中国人民的信任和尊敬。
    他说：中华全国合作社联合总社所走过的光荣的道路，不仅在中国成为社会主义建设中的巨大成就，而且将给朝鲜合作社运动以宝贵的经验，并成为应该学习的很好的榜样。
    最后，金重泰说：朝鲜合作社更认为你们是最可靠的朋友之一。他们将用一切力量去保护朝中两国人民及以苏联为首的人民民主阵营之间的团结友谊，像保护自己的眼珠一样。企图破坏我们的正义事业的任何阴谋，都不能阻碍我们走向胜利。
