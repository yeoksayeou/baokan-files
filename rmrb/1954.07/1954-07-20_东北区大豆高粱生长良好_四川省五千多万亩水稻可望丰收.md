Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, July 19th: Soybeans, sorghum, and other major crops in the Northeast region are growing well, and the wheat harvest season is about to begin. It is expected that 140,000 hectares (each hectare equals fifteen mu) of wheat in Liaoxi Province will have a bumper harvest. It is estimated that Ning'an County, Songjiang Province, with 35,000 hectares of wheat, will yield 700 catties more per hectare than last year based on the current situation.

Currently, the Northeast region is in its most intensive farming season. Farmers in various areas are actively strengthening field management to protect and promote the growth and development of crops. Large fields in various regions have entered the third round of weeding. In Yanbian Korean Autonomous Region, Jilin Province, some large fields have completed four rounds of weeding. Summer weeding competitions, centered on agricultural production cooperatives in some areas, have greatly contributed to increasing weeding speed and protecting seedlings. Rural women and students on summer vacation are participating in summer weeding more than in previous years, which has also accelerated weeding, thinning, and topdressing. Many mutual aid and cooperation organizations have also achieved continuous operation plans for weeding, thinning, and topdressing. Farmers in the cotton-producing areas of Liaoxi, Liaodong, and Rehe Provinces are actively preventing and controlling aphids with the help of local agricultural technology promotion stations. After recognizing the significance of increasing cotton production, members of the Xiangqian Agricultural Production Cooperative in Beigong Village, Lingyuan County, Rehe Province, sprayed 666 powder twice in the cotton fields where aphids occurred, and transplanted more than 300 seedlings, making the cotton seedlings grow vigorously again.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, July 19th: Sichuan Province's more than 51 million mu of rice is expected to have a bumper harvest, and farmers are busily preparing for the autumn harvest.

This year, the rice planting area in Sichuan Province has been expanded by more than one million mu compared to last year, and the area with sparse seedling and dense planting has also increased significantly. Rice in most areas is maturing uniformly, so the autumn harvest will be very intensive.

In the vast rural areas of Sichuan Province, where the number of organized farmers has more than doubled compared to last year, the slogan "Reduce waste and strive for every grain to return home" has been loudly put forward to increase the harvest yield. Farmers in various areas are adding and repairing various agricultural tools needed for the autumn harvest. Agricultural production cooperatives have all formulated autumn harvest plans and divided labor according to skills and manpower, and rationally adjusted labor organization. Mutual aid teams, with the help of agricultural production cooperatives, have arranged agricultural work in advance, and some have roughly determined the order of harvesting based on the principle of "harvesting the ripe first." Many individual farmers have also invited each other to form threshing organizations of four people each.

    东北区大豆高粱生长良好
    四川省五千多万亩水稻可望丰收
   【新华社沈阳十九日电】东北区大豆、高粱等主要作物生长良好，小麦收获季节就要开始。辽西省十四万垧（每垧合十五市亩）小麦可望丰收。松江省宁安县三万五千垧小麦，根据当前情况预计，每垧可比去年多收七百斤。
    现在东北区正处在最紧张的农忙时期。各地农民正积极加强田间管理，保护和促进禾苗的生长发育。各地大田已进入第三遍铲?。吉林省延边朝鲜族自治区部分大田已铲完四遍。某些地方以农业生产合作社为核心展开的夏锄竞赛，对增加铲?速度和保苗起了很大作用。各地农村妇女和在暑假期中的学生，比往年更多地参加夏锄，也加快了铲?、间苗和追肥等工作。许多互助合作组织还实现了铲?、间苗、追肥连续作业的计划。辽西、辽东、热河三省的产棉区农民，在当地农业技术推广站帮助下，正积极防治蚜虫。热河省凌源县北宫村向前农业生产合作社的社员认识到增产棉花的意义后，就在发生蚜虫的棉田内喷洒六六六粉两遍，又移苗三百多棵，使棉苗重新生长茁壮。
   【新华社成都十九日电】四川省五千一百多万亩水稻丰收在望，农民正紧张地进行秋收准备。
    今年四川省水稻种植面积比去年扩大一百多万亩，少秧密植的面积也增加很多。各地水稻大多成熟一致，因此秋收工作将十分紧张。
    在目前组织起来的农户超过去年一倍左右的四川省广大农村里，已经响亮地提出“减少抛撒，争取颗粒还家”的口号，以提高收获量。各地农民纷纷添买和修补各种秋收需用的农具。农业生产合作社都订出秋收计划，并按技术和劳力进行分工，合理调整劳动组织。互助组在农业生产合作社帮助下都预先安排农活，有的并根据“先黄先打”的原则，大体上确定了收割次序。许多单干农民也相互邀约组成每四个人一组的打谷组织。
