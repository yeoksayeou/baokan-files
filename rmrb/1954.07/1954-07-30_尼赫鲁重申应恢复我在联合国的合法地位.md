Xinhua News Agency, Yajimer, July 28th: Indian Prime Minister Nehru reiterated the proposal to restore the legitimate status of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations when he delivered a speech at the meeting of the All-India National Congress Committee on the 27th. He said that the failure to recognize such an obvious reality was due to the failure to face the facts. He said that the war in Indochina, which had dragged on for seven years in the past, had not been resolved because of the failure to face reality.

Nehru pointed out that "to think that Taiwan represents China is as unreasonable as thinking that the Andaman Islands represent India's 360 million people." He believes that it is regrettable that this issue has not been handled in accordance with the UN Charter.

    尼赫鲁重申应恢复我在联合国的合法地位
    【新华社二十八日讯】亚日米尔消息：印度总理尼赫鲁二十七日在印度国大党全国委员会会议上发表演说时重申恢复中华人民共和国在联合国合法地位的主张。他说，不承认这样一种明显的现实是由于未能正视事实。他说，过去在印度支那拖了七年之久的战争之所以一直未能解决，就是因为未能正视现实所致。
    尼赫鲁指出，“认为台湾是代表中国正像认为安达曼群岛是代表印度的三亿六千万人民一样的不合理”。他认为在这个问题上未能按联合国宪章办事是一件遗憾的事情。
