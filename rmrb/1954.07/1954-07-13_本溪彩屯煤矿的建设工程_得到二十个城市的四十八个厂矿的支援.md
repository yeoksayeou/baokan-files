The construction project of Benxi Caitun Coal Mine (vertical shaft) has received support from forty-eight factories and mines in twenty cities.

The Caitun Coal Mine is scheduled to be put into production before October 1st. Therefore, the installation of various mechanical and electrical equipment must be carried out urgently. According to the plan, the installation of a tippler requires four large wheel rim components. These components need to be made of cast steel material, which is very large in size. General machine factories cannot produce them, and the units that can produce them are temporarily unable to undertake the task due to the large number of orders from basic construction departments. When the workers of Dalian No. 20 Factory under the Lüda Machinery and Hardware General Factory heard the news, they expressed great concern. The factory had never produced cast steel products before, but they happily accepted the task of producing this product. Some workers said, "We must find a way to use the large wheel rims we make with our own hands in the construction of the motherland's coal mines." They also guaranteed early delivery.

Under the urgent circumstances, the workers of Jilin Machinery Factory undertook the task of manufacturing stop car machines, coal feeders, and car pulling machines to support the Caitun Coal Mine in starting production on schedule. When the workers heard that they were going to manufacture products for Benxi Caitun Coal Mine, they all felt happy and honored. At the meeting, they all expressed their determination to complete the task ahead of schedule. As a result, the delivery date was fifteen days ahead of the original plan.

As the heart of coal mine production—the electric motor—this is an important piece of equipment in the installation project of the Caitun vertical shaft. The workers of Jiamusi Electric Motor Factory and Harbin Electric Motor Factory, who are responsible for manufacturing the equipment, have all displayed their enthusiasm for labor and completed the original plan for the electric motors to be delivered in batches in the third quarter ahead of schedule. They have now delivered the goods in May and June, creating conditions for Caitun Coal Mine to complete the equipment installation plan on schedule.

    本溪彩屯煤矿的建设工程
    得到二十个城市的四十八个厂矿的支援
    本溪彩屯煤矿（竖井）的建设工程，得到二十个城市的四十八个厂矿的支援。
    彩屯煤矿在十月一日以前就要投入生产，因此，各项机电设备的安装工程就必须紧张地进行施工。在计划中要安装一项翻车机，需要四个大轮圈的机件，这种机件要用铸钢料来做，体积很大，一般机器工厂不能制作，能制作的单位又因基本建设部门订货繁多而暂时不能承受。当旅大机械五金总厂大连二十厂职工听到这个消息时，表示非常关心。该厂从未做过铸钢料的产品，但愉快地接受了这个产品的制作任务。有的工人说，咱们总要想办法，把我们亲手做出来的大轮圈使用到祖国煤矿建设工程上去。他们还保证提前交货。
    吉林省机械厂职工在任务紧迫的情况下，为了支援彩屯煤矿能够按期开工生产，承担了制作档车机、给煤机和引车机的任务。工人们一听说要给本溪彩屯煤矿制作产品，都感到高兴和光荣，在会上都纷纷表示，决心提前完成这项任务。结果，交货日期比原计划提前了十五天。
    作为煤矿生产的心脏——电动机，这是彩屯竖井安装工程中的重要设备。负责制作该项设备的佳木斯电机厂和哈尔滨电机厂职工，都发挥了劳动热情，提前完成了原订电动机在三季度分次交货计划，现已提前在五月和六月交货，给彩屯煤矿按期完成设备安装计划创造了条件。
