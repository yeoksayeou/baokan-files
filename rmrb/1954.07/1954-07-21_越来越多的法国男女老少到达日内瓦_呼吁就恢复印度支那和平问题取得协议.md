Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, July 19th: As the Geneva Conference approaches its decisive moment, more and more men, women, and children from all over France are arriving here to make a last-ditch appeal for the conference to reach an agreement on the peaceful settlement of the Indochina issue. In the past 48 hours, more than 600 people have visited the delegations of various countries here. Since June, a total of approximately 3,300 people, representing millions of French people with various political views, have visited the delegations of various countries.

The people who have come in the last two days come from a wider range of social strata and a wider range of regions than before. In addition to the workers from Lyon, the housewives from Paris, and the farmers from southern France who have sent many delegations to Geneva, there are now mayors from the Gard region, dockworkers from Dunkirk, and Catholics from Vichy. Some French people, although still sick and not fully recovered, have also come here to demand peace. Some farmers in northern France have used a lot of money from their year's savings as travel expenses and living expenses in Geneva.

Petitioners who have come here in the past few days have, without exception, raised the same urgent question: "Will the Geneva Conference be able to reach an agreement on a ceasefire by the 20th?"

A delegation from Neuilly-Plaisance, composed of a member of the municipal council, a female textile worker, a farmer, and a middle school student, came to Geneva on the 18th with such a question in their hearts, to meet with the French delegation to get an answer and make their demands. In front of the residence of the French delegation, two armed Swiss police officers stopped them and said, "The delegation is very busy and cannot meet with you."

The member of the municipal council asked the Swiss police to tell the French delegation: "The people in my city welcome the July 20th deadline announced by Mendès-France, as long as real efforts are made while making this promise. We hope the delegation recognizes that the Geneva Conference is a conference of mutual concessions." He said that the French people will never allow the great hopes raised by the promises made by their government to be turned into a bubble by their government again.

The middle-aged woman (textile worker) left a petition with the French delegation, demanding an immediate ceasefire and the immediate return of all French soldiers in Indochina. This petition was passed by the workers at a meeting before she left for Geneva. "Since the meeting between our Prime Minister and Dulles in Paris, the movement for peace has reached a new high tide. We have distributed leaflets in the city and posted slogans on the walls of factories, denouncing the United States for putting pressure on France in Geneva and Paris. We must make our demands clear to our government and the Americans."

The farmer, who fought in North Africa in 1942, said, "Like all French farmers, I don't want to see my only son sent to Indochina to kill or be killed for the benefit of the United States." He added that since the American generals want to continue the war, it would be best to send them to the front lines and let them fight themselves.

Seventeen-year-old middle school student Robert Mauru (whose entire family was killed in a German concentration camp) handed the French delegation a petition signed by more than 300 young people in his city. The petition, tied with a red, white, and blue ribbon, read: "We, the boys and girls of Neuilly-Plaisance, ask you to do something in Geneva to immediately stop the Indochina War. Young people are the first victims of war. The threat of the continuation of the Indochina War is making us uneasy, and we know that if the war is not stopped now, we will sooner or later be sent to Indochina to die." Robert Mauru said: "France now has an opportunity in Geneva to show its independence to the Americans and restore the prestige it has lost."

Like all other French people's delegations, these four petitioners ran to the American delegation to protest in writing and verbally against the American oppression of France's refusal to reach an agreement in Geneva. Due to the public's outrage over the American delegation's refusal to meet with French petitioners in the past few weeks, this time the American delegation met with them, but used the petitioners' visit to conduct pro-American propaganda. An American who claimed to have lived in China for 30 years and could speak French delivered a half-hour tirade of slander against China. He also gave them mimeographed copies of the same slanderous remarks. When the petitioners noticed many loopholes in his remarks and asked him questions, the American stood up and said that his French was not good enough to understand their questions, ending the petitioners' visit.

These four petitioners also visited the delegations of China, the Soviet Union, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, praising their efforts to reach an agreement at the Geneva Conference. The member of the municipal council, on behalf of the group of petitioners, said: "We are optimistic because we believe that your sincere efforts will eventually lead to some positive results at the conference." They also left copies of their appeal to the French delegation and their protest to the American delegation.

### 越来越多的法国男女老少到达日内瓦  呼吁就恢复印度支那和平问题取得协议

    越来越多的法国男女老少到达日内瓦
    呼吁就恢复印度支那和平问题取得协议
    【新华社日内瓦十九日电】当日内瓦会议快到决定性的时刻的时候，有越来越多的男女老少从法国各地来到这里，为要求会议就和平解决印度支那问题取得协议而发出最后关头的呼吁。在过去四十八小时内，有六百多人访问了这里的各国代表团。从六月以来一共约有三千三百人访问了各国代表团，他们代表着千千万万具有各种不同政治见解的法国人民。
    这两天来的人是从远比以前更广泛的阶层和更广大的地区来的。除了派了许多代表团到日内瓦来的里昂工人、巴黎的家庭妇女和法国南部的农民以外，现在还有加尔省的市长们，敦刻尔克的码头工人们和维希的天主教徒们。有几个法国人虽然生病还没有完全恢复健康，也到这里来要求和平。法国北部的一些农民把他们一年的积蓄中的许多钱用来作为旅费和在日内瓦的生活费。
    前几天到这里来的请愿者，都无例外地提出同样迫切的问题：“到二十日那天日内瓦会议能够在停火问题上达成一个协议吗？”
    有一个从诺伊利—普莱桑来的、由市政委员会委员、纺织女工、农民和中学生各一人组成的代表团，就在心中带着这样一个问题在十八日来到日内瓦，去见法国代表团，想得到答复并提出他们的要求。在法国代表团寓所门前，两个武装的瑞士警察拦住了他们，对他们说：“代表团很忙，不能接见你们。”
    市政委员会的委员要求瑞士警察告诉法国代表团：“在我的城市中的人民欢迎孟戴斯—弗朗斯所宣布的七月二十日的期限，只要在提出这个诺言的同时作真正的努力。我们希望代表团认识到：日内瓦会议是互相作让步的会议。”他说，法国人民决不允许因他们政府所作的诺言而引起的很大的希望又被他们的政府弄成泡影。
    这个中年妇女（纺织女工）给法国代表团留下一份呼吁书，要求立即停火，并立即使在印度支那的所有法国士兵回国。这份呼吁书是她动身来日内瓦之前由工人们在一次会议上通过的。“自从我们的总理和杜勒斯在巴黎会谈以来，要求和平的运动已达到一个新的高潮。我们在城里散发了传单，在工厂的墙上张贴了标语，斥责美国在日内瓦和巴黎对法国施加压力。我们必须让我们的政府和美国人明确无误地听到我们的要求。”
    这个农民是一九四二年曾在北非作战过的，他说：“像所有的法国农民一样，我不希望看到我的唯一的儿子被送到印度支那去为美国的利益杀人或被人杀死。”他又说，既然美国的将军们希望把战争继续打下去，那么最好能把他们送到前线去让他们自己去打仗。
    十七岁的中学生罗伯·毛鲁（他的全家都在一个德国集中营中被杀害）交给法国代表团一份由他的城里的三百多名青年签名的呼吁书。用蓝白红三色丝带扎着的这份呼吁书写着：“我们诺伊利—普莱桑的男女孩子们要求你们在日内瓦做些事情来立即停止印度支那战争。青年是战争的首先的牺牲品。印度支那战争继续打下去的威胁正在使我们惶惶不安，我们知道如果战争现在不停止，我们迟早将被送到印度支那去送死。”罗伯·毛鲁说：“法国现在在日内瓦有一个机会向美国人显示它的独立性和恢复它已丧失了的威信。”
    像所有其他法国人民代表团一样，这四个请愿者跑到美国代表团那里去，对美国压迫法国拒绝在日内瓦达成协议进行书面和口头的抗议。由于过去几星期来公众对美国代表团拒绝接见法国请愿者表示了愤慨，因此这一次美国代表团接见了他们，但是却利用请愿者的访问来进行有利美国的宣传。一个自称在中国居留了三十年的能说法文的美国人，向他们发表了半小时的诽谤中国的言论。他并发给他们刊载着同样的诽谤言论的油印印刷品。当请愿者注意到他的言论中有许多破绽而向他提出问题时，这个美国人站了起来，说他的法文不好，不能懂得他们的问题，而结束了请愿者的访问。
    这四个请愿者并访问了中国、苏联和越南民主共和国的代表团，赞扬这些代表团在日内瓦会议上为了达成协议而作的努力。市政委员会委员代表这群请愿者说：“我们是乐观的，因为我们相信你们的诚恳努力终将使会议获得一些积极成果。”他们并留下了他们向法国代表团所致送的呼吁书和向美国代表团所提出的抗议书的副本。
