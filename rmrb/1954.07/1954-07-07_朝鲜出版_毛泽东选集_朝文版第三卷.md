    【新华社平壤一日电】朝鲜劳动党出版社最近出版了“毛泽东选集”朝文版第三卷，共分上、下两册。
    朝鲜劳动党中央委员会机关杂志“勤劳者”的六月号上发表了一篇介绍的文章说：“毛泽东选集”朝文版第三卷收集了毛泽东同志从一九四一年三月到一九四五年八月期间的著作。毛泽东同志在这些著作里，发展和具体化了马克思列宁主义关于殖民地和半殖民地国家的革命运动和工人阶级的政党在这个运动中的作用的学说，科学地阐明了中国人民革命中的最重要的问题。
    文章又写道：毛泽东同志在抗日战争时期的这些著作，清楚地说明了中国共产党和中国人民在这一时期内，怎样战胜了敌人。这些著作不仅对中国人民，而且对全世界人民特别是对殖民地、半殖民地人民的解放斗争，提供了丰富的斗争经验。
