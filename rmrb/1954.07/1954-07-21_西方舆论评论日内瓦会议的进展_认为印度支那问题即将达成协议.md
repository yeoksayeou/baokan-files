Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, July 20th: Major Swiss newspapers here expressed deep conviction on the 20th that the Geneva Conference would be successful in its final stages. Most newspapers hoped that the conference would announce a ceasefire in Indochina on the 20th, perhaps.

Newspapers reported that in order to resolve the remaining differences, the delegations would have intense activity in the last 24 hours, and the foreign ministers would hold talks on the 20th.

The newspapers also prominently published a visit to Pham Van Dong by a French reporter on the evening of the 19th. "La Voix Ouvrière" and the "Journal de Genève" emphasized the sincerity expressed by the acting Foreign Minister of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in his meeting with the reporter. The "Journal de Genève's" Paris correspondent wrote that the general feeling in Paris was that a ceasefire was certain.

"La Voix Ouvrière" expressed the wishes of the Swiss people, saying: "We can have no more fervent wish today than to be able to bring the silence of the battlefield to the people of Indochina and to make progress towards the consolidation of world peace."

Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, July 19th: Almost all Parisian newspapers on the 19th expressed their belief that after the nine foreign ministers held a meeting here on Sunday and made many informal contacts, the Geneva Conference's goal of restoring peace in Indochina would soon be achieved.

"L'Humanité" said that the efforts of the delegations of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Soviet Union, and China had prompted a change in the atmosphere in Geneva, bringing bright hope for an early ceasefire agreement. "L'Humanité" reporter Pierre Goutard wrote: "On Saturday evening, the difficulties increased to a point that made everyone very uneasy. It seemed that American pressure on the French delegation had a very bad effect. The French negotiators took a negative attitude on all issues, without exception... On Saturday evening, Saturday night, and Sunday morning, those who supported reaching an agreement, especially the Soviet delegation, launched decisive efforts. The fundamental issues were raised with the necessary force and clarity. Finally, the decision to convene a nine-nation conference on Sunday afternoon forced Smith to face his responsibilities. The time had come for him to openly agree to or reject peace."

"He did not say yes. His speech showed that the United States would not abandon its plan to re-raise the issue of resolving the Indochina issue and to maintain a situation of force forever in this part of the world. In every line of this American representative's speech, one could see the thoughts running through his mind. His speech was vague and sometimes despicable."

"But one thing is clear now: the U.S. government has been forced, little by little, to admit that it does not have the power to obstruct the conclusion of a truce agreement."

"L'Humanité" asserted that the disputes that remained to be resolved could not be considered insurmountable, saying: "At least it can be said that unless the French delegation raises new demands that violate the fundamental principles of lasting peace (namely, the principles of unity, independence, and the right of the Vietnamese people to freely choose their government and their system), the hope of achieving success within the time limit set by (Mendès-France) is indeed very high."

Xinhua News Agency, July 20th: TASS, Geneva, July 19th: The Soviet delegation's assessment at the 18th meeting of the work of the Geneva Conference over the past month and the current situation of the Geneva Conference attracted the attention of political commentators, local reporters, and foreign reporters. This assessment became the subject of newspaper commentary and lively discussion at the "Press Building" on the 19th.

Local newspapers published the basic contents of the Soviet delegation's speech on the 18th, and they particularly emphasized the point in the speech that while it would be incorrect to think that everything has been arranged and that there are no more difficult problems, one cannot fail to recognize the objective value of the achievements made by the Geneva Conference. Many observers and commentators agreed with the Soviet delegation's view that the recent contacts and talks between members of the delegations have played a beneficial role and will continue to pave the way for resolving outstanding issues. The "Tribune de Genève" introduced the essence of the Soviet assessment of the Geneva Conference with the headline "Progress Achieved at Geneva Conference." The newspaper pointed out that after the meeting on the afternoon of the 18th, "there was a general feeling that the tense atmosphere had eased."

The "Journal de Genève" also expressed the same opinion. The newspaper wrote that after the meeting on the 18th, there was a general sense of optimism.

In the comments of newspapers and political commentators, the Soviet Union's calm and objective assessment of the progress of the Geneva talks was compared to the malicious rumors of the enemies of peace, who recently made special efforts to poison the atmosphere and deceive public opinion, absurdly claiming that the Geneva Conference was inevitably doomed to "failure." These self-proclaimed "prophets" took their wishes for reality, and their angry and malicious propaganda was dealt a heavy blow.

A commentator for the "Feuille d'Avis de Lausanne" wrote: "Molotov gave a clear and unambiguous assessment of the situation at the Geneva Conference."

The great interest in the Soviet delegation's speech on the 18th proves how the Soviet delegation's confidence in the possibility of achieving positive results at the Geneva Conference corresponds to the hopes of broad social strata in various countries around the world. They see the positive results already achieved at the Geneva Conference as a victory for the forces of peace. At the same time, they have maintained vigilance and caution against all kinds of conspiracies that deliberately exaggerate the issues that have not yet been agreed upon. For example, on the 18th, everyone paid close attention to the suspicious conspiratorial activities of the Bảo Đại delegation.

That day, the "Press Building" was notified that this delegation had decided to hold a press conference at the moment when the nine-nation delegation was holding a closed-door meeting. The press conference was eventually cancelled. But later, the Bảo Đại delegation distributed a statement insisting on the demands they had made in the note to the French delegation on July 17.

Judging from these demands quoted in the "Feuille d'Avis de Lausanne," they show that the Bảo Đại regime is delusionally seeking the right to speak for the Vietnamese people. In the aforementioned statement, the Bảo Đại delegation boasted that a "demonstration of unprecedented scale" would be held in Saigon on the 18th. As intended by the organizers of the demonstration, this demonstration was intended to show the people's will to unite around the Bảo Đại regime to seek unification.

However, according to reports from foreign news agencies, the total number of participants in this much-publicized demonstration was only a few hundred, and these few hundred people were rounded up by the authorities in the city and even in the entire province and forcibly transported to Saigon by car.

These reports here aroused much sarcasm at Bảo Đại's overreaching aspirations. If everyone did not know that all of their machinations were instigated by their foreign masters, then perhaps no one would pay attention to their conspiracy itself. In this regard, everyone is paying attention to the fact that the moment the Bảo Đại elements issued the statement coincided with the American representative Smith's assurance at the meeting that if the meeting reached an agreement that the United States approved of, then the United States would issue a separate statement stating that it would not undermine the agreement. Observers here assessed Smith's speech as follows: The American ruling group, foreseeing that the Geneva Conference would adopt resolutions acceptable to both parties, is still trying to put together a Southeast Asian aggressive bloc in order to pursue a policy of obstructing the restoration of peace in Indochina.

In any case, the overwhelming majority of opinion here, which has been further strengthened by the Soviet delegation's speech on the 18th, is that although there are still differences on some issues and the difficulties on the road to the success of the conference cannot be underestimated, there is still every possibility of reaching an agreement based on respect for the legitimate national rights of the people of Indochina.

    西方舆论评论日内瓦会议的进展
    认为印度支那问题即将达成协议
   【新华社日内瓦二十日电】这里主要的瑞士报纸在二十日表示深信日内瓦会议在最后阶段取得成功。大多数报纸希望会议在二十日或许将宣布印度支那停火。
    报纸报道，为了解决剩下的分歧，各代表团在最后二十四小时内将有紧张的活动，外长们在二十日将进行会谈。
    报纸还显著地刊载了法国记者十九日晚对范文同的访问记，“工人之声报”和“瑞士报”强调了越南民主共和国代理外长在接见记者中所表示的诚恳。“瑞士报”驻巴黎记者写道，巴黎的一般感觉是停火是确实了。
    “工人之声报”表达瑞士人民的愿望说：“除了愿望今天能够给印度支那各国人民带来战场的静寂和向着世界和平的巩固取得进展之外，今天我们不能再有更热烈的愿望了。”
    【新华社日内瓦十九日电】几乎所有的巴黎报纸十九日都表示，相信在九国外长星期日在这里举行会议并进行了许多非正式的接触以后，日内瓦会议的恢复印度支那和平的目标很快就要达到了。
    “人道报”说，越南民主共和国、苏联和中国的代表团的努力，促使日内瓦的气氛改变，为早日达成停火协议带来了光明的希望。“人道报”记者皮埃尔·古达德写道：“星期六傍晚，困难增加到使大家非常不安的地步。看起来，美国对法国代表团的压力产生了很恶劣的效果。法国的谈判代表在一切问题上，毫无例外地采取了否定的态度……星期六傍晚、星期六夜里和星期日上午，支持取得协议的人，尤其是苏联代表团展开了决定性的努力。基本问题用必要的力量和明确性提出来了。最后，在星期日下午召集九国会议的决定使史密斯不得不正视他的责任。他公开对和平表示同意或拒绝的时候到了。?
    “他没有说同意。他的发言说明美国将不放弃他们的这样一个计划：把解决印度支那问题这个问题再度提出来，并在世界的这一部分永远保持一种武力局面。在这位美国代表的发言的每一行里都能够看出他脑筋里转的念头来，他的发言含糊其词，有时很卑劣。
      “但是目前有一点是很明显了：美国政府已经
  一点一点地被迫承认，它没有力量阻挠停战协定的缔结。”
      “人道报”肯定地说不能认为仍待解决的争执问题是不可克服的，它说：“至少可以这样说：除非法国代表团提出了违反持久和平的基本原则（就是统一、独立、越南人民有权自由选择他们的政府和他们的制度等原则）的新要求，在（孟戴斯—弗朗斯）规定的时限内获得成功的希望，的确是非常大的。”
    【新华社二十日讯】塔斯社日内瓦十九日讯：苏联代表团在十八日会议上对日内瓦会议过去一个月的工作以及日内瓦会议现在所处的情况所作的估计引起政治评论员、当地的记者和外国的记者的注意。这个估计成为十九日报纸评论和“新闻大厦”议论纷纭的主题。
    当地报纸刊载了苏联代表团十八日发言中的基本内容，它们特别强调指出发言中的这一论点：虽然，认为一切都已安排停当而再没有什么困难问题了，这样的看法是不对的，但是也不能不承认日内瓦会议所取得的成就的客观价值。许多观察家和评论员都赞同苏联代表团的看法，即各代表团成员最近的接触和会谈起了有益的作用，这已经而且还将继续为解决尚未解决的问题打开道路。“邮报”以“日内瓦会议已获得进展”这个大标题来介绍苏联对日内瓦会议情况的估计的实质。报纸指出，十八日下午会议结束后，“普遍感到紧张空气有所缓和”。
  “日内瓦日报”也表示了同样的意见。这家报纸写道，十八日会议开完之后，普遍有乐观的情绪。
    在报纸和政治评论员的评论中，都拿苏联对日内瓦商谈的进展所作的冷静而客观的估计跟和平敌人的恶意的造谣作了比较。和平的敌人最近特别力图毒化气氛和欺骗舆论，胡说什么日内瓦会议不可避免地要“失败”。这些自封的“预言家”把愿望当成了现实，他们所作的怒气冲冲的不怀好意的宣传遭到了狠狠的打击。
        “洛桑日报”的评论员写道：“莫洛托夫对日内瓦会议的情况作了明白的、没有一点含糊的估计。”
    大家对苏联代表团十八日的发言十分感兴趣，这就证明：苏联代表团对日内瓦会议能够取得积极结果所表示的信心是怎样符合世界各国广泛的社会阶层的希望。他们把在日内瓦会议上已取得的积极的结果看成是和平力量的胜利。同时，他们对故意夸大还未达成协议的问题的种种阴谋诡计保持了警惕和戒心。例如，十八日大家就很注意保大代表团的可疑的阴谋活动。
    那天在“新闻大厦”得到通知，这个代表团决定在九国代表团举行秘密会议的时刻举行一次记者招待会。记者招待会最后被取消了。但是后来保大代表团散发了一个声明，声明中坚持他们在七月十七日给法国代表团的照会中所提出的要求。
    从“洛桑日报”所引的这些要求来看，他们表示保大政权妄想得到代表越南人民说话的权利。保大代表团在上述的声明中吹牛说，十八日西贡将举行一次“规模空前”的大示威。像示威的策动者所打算的，这次示威要表现人民要求团结在保大政权周围求得统一的意志。
    但是，根据外国通讯社的报道，参加这一大肆宣扬的示威的一共只不过几百个人，这几百个人还是当局在市内搜罗的，甚至是在全省区内搜罗起来，用汽车强迫运到西贡的。
    这些消息在这里引起了对保大这种不自量力的奢求的许多讽刺。如果大家不知道他们的全部勾当都是由他们的外国主子唆使的，那么他们这种阴谋本身也许没有人去理会。在这方面，大家注意的是：保大分子发表声明的时刻，恰当美国代表史密斯在会议上保证说，如果会议达成了美国所赞同的协议，那么美国将发表单独声明，声明不破坏协议。这里的观察家对史密斯的发言作了这样的估计：美国统治集团由于预见到日内瓦会议将通过双方都能
  一致接受的决议，为了奉行阻挠恢复印度支那和平的政策，仍在竭力拼凑东南亚侵略集团。
    不管怎样，由于苏联代表团十八日的发言而更加坚定的这里压倒多数的意见是：虽然现在在某些问题上仍然存在分歧，不能低估会议成功道路上的困难，但是，仍然有着一切可能，在尊重印度支那各国人民的合法的民族权利的基础上达成协议。
