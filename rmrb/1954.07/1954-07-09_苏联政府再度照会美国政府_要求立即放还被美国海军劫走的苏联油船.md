Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 8th: It was previously reported that on June 24th, the Soviet government sent a note to the U.S. government regarding the hijacking of the Soviet oil tanker "Tuapse" by a warship in the seas south of Taiwan Island, an area controlled by the U.S. Navy.

    On June 26th, the U.S. Embassy in Moscow submitted a reply to the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs on this matter. In its reply, the U.S. government categorically denied that the U.S. Navy had participated in the illegal hijacking of the Soviet ship.

    In response, the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent another note to the U.S. Embassy on July 2nd.

    The note stated: The Soviet government deems it necessary to declare that it cannot consider the U.S. government's response to the Soviet government's note of June 24th to be satisfactory. In its note of June 26th, the U.S. government neither denied the fact that the "Tuapse" oil tanker was hijacked by a warship, nor did it deny that the high seas where the incident occurred were under the control of the U.S. naval fleet. The hijacking of the Soviet oil tanker in the seas controlled by the U.S. fleet and patrolled by U.S. military aircraft can only have been done by the U.S. Navy, regardless of what flag it flew.

    The note stated: The Soviet government protests to the U.S. government regarding the continued detention of the Soviet oil tanker "Tuapse" and firmly demands that immediate measures be taken to return the aforementioned oil tanker and its entire crew and cargo. The Soviet government also hopes that the U.S. government will take appropriate measures to prevent similar illegal actions that grossly violate the freedom of navigation on the high seas from occurring in the future.

    At the same time, the Soviet government reserves the right to demand that the U.S. government compensate the Soviet Union for the losses incurred due to the hijacking of the "Tuapse" oil tanker.

    苏联政府再度照会美国政府
    要求立即放还被美国海军劫走的苏联油船
   【新华社八日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：前已报道，六月二十四日，苏联政府曾就苏联油船“图阿普斯号”在台湾岛以南美国海军所控制的海面上被一艘军舰劫走一事送给美国政府照会一份。
    美国驻莫斯科大使馆六月二十六日就这一问题向苏联外交部提出了复照，美国政府在复照中矢口否认美国海军曾参与非法劫走苏联的海船。
    为此，苏联外交部七月二日再致照会给美国大使馆。
    照会说：苏联政府认为有必要声明，它不能认为美国政府对苏联政府六月二十四日的照会的回答是令人满意的。美国政府在六月二十六日的照会中既没有否认“图阿普斯号”油船被一艘军舰劫走的事实，也没有否认出事的公海海面是在美国的海军舰队控制之下。苏联油船在美国舰队控制下和美国军用飞机巡逻下的海面上被劫走，只能是美国海军所干的，不管它挂的是什么旗帜。
    照会说：苏联政府对苏联油船“图阿普斯号”继续被扣留一事向美国政府提出抗议，并坚决要求立即采取措施放还上述油船及全体船员与货物。苏联政府并希望美国政府采取应有的措施，以防止今后发生类似的、粗暴地破坏公海航行自由的非法行动。
    同时苏联政府保留要求美国政府赔偿由于“图阿普斯号”油船被劫而使苏联遭到的损失的权利。
