Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, July 5th: The Second International Conference of Metal and Machine Workers opened in Vienna on July 3rd. More than 250 delegates and guests from over 30 countries are participating in the conference. Many of them represent trade union organizations that have not yet joined the Metal and Machine Workers Trade Unions International (Industry Department of the World Federation of Trade Unions).

    The opening address was delivered by Rovid, Chairman of the Metal and Machine Workers Trade Unions International. He said that the conference will greatly contribute to the concerted action of metal and machine workers in various countries in the struggle for the people's welfare, for freedom and peace.
    After the adoption of the agenda, Louis Saillant, Secretary-General of the World Federation of Trade Unions, congratulated the delegates.
    Rudan, Secretary-General of the Metal and Machine Workers Trade Unions International, made a report on "The work of the Trade Unions International, strengthening the struggle of men and women workers in the metal and machine manufacturing industry to improve working and living conditions, to fight for peace and to consolidate their unity in the struggle."
    He cited many specific figures to illustrate the sharp decline in real wages, the extension of working hours and the increase in unemployment in capitalist countries. Rudan pointed out that in order to pursue maximum profits, capitalists are implementing high production quotas and speed-up systems in various factories. He emphasized that the speed-up system under capitalism reduces wages, lowers the living standards of workers and increases the number of work accidents. This results in the dismissal of tens of thousands of employees, the closure of many factories, and the unprecedented increase in the profits of the imperialists.
    Rudan described the fierce opposition of metal and machine workers to the policies of war, poverty and super-exploitation implemented by monopoly capital. He emphasized that the workers' struggle for the satisfaction of economic and social demands is increasingly combined with the struggle for democracy, national independence and peace, with the struggle against the "European Coal and Steel Community" – the arsenal for the Third World War being prepared by the imperialists – and with the struggle against the ratification of the Bonn and Paris war treaties.
    Rudan finally called on metal and machine workers from all countries to take concerted action in the struggle. He put forward proposals to strengthen concerted action. He specifically suggested organizing a week of struggle against the "European Coal and Steel Community" by the end of this year.
    During the discussion of Rudan's report, Zacharias, the representative of the Cypriot metal workers, pointed out that the brutal exploitation of Cypriot workers is particularly severe due to colonial oppression. There are no laws guaranteeing trade union rights and democratic freedoms.
    Sihak (Czechoslovakia), in summarizing the achievements of the All-European Trade Union Conference, emphasized that it once again demonstrated the desire for peace of millions of European workers.
    Fellaubaty, the representative of the Luxembourg metal workers, spoke about the struggle of the Luxembourg workers against the "Schuman Plan," which further impoverishes the workers and greatly increases the profits of the capitalists.
    Also speaking at the meeting were: Saloinen (Finland) and Johnson (International Democratic Women's Federation).

    五金和机器工人第二届国际会议开幕
    【新华社五日讯】据塔斯社维也纳四日讯：五金和机器工人第二届国际会议七月三日在维也纳开幕。参加会议的有来自三十多个国家的二百五十多个代表和来宾。他们有许多是代表还没有参加五金机器工人工会国际（世界工会联合会产业部）的工会组织的。
    五金机器工人工会国际主席罗维达致开幕词。他说，会议将大大有助于世界各国的五金和机器工人在争取人民福利、争取自由和和平的斗争中的一致行动。
    通过议程后，世界工联总书记路易·赛扬向代表们祝贺。
    五金机器工人工会国际总书记儒丹作了关于“工会国际的工作、加强五金和机器制造工业男女工人争取改善工作和生活条件、争取和平的斗争并巩固他们在斗争中的团结”的报告。
    他列举了很多具体数字说明资本主义国家的实际工资尖锐下降、工作时间延长和失业人数增加的情况。儒丹指出，资本家为了追求最大限度的利润，正在各工厂中实行高额生产定额和赶快制度。他着重指出，在资本主义下的赶快制度减低了工资、降低了工人的生活水平并且增加工作事故的次数。这使得成千成万的职工被解雇、许多工厂倒闭、帝国主义者的利润空前增加。
    儒丹叙述了垄断资本所实行的战争、贫穷和超额剥削政策遭到五金和机器工人激烈的反对的情况。他强调指出：工人争取满足经济和社会要求的斗争，越来越经常地和争取民主、民族独立与和平的斗争结合起来，和反对“欧洲煤钢联营集团”——帝国主义者正在准备的第三次世界大战的兵工厂——的斗争结合起来，和反对批准波恩和巴黎战争条约的斗争结合起来。
    儒丹最后要求各国的五金和机器工人在斗争中采取一致行动。他提出了加强一致行动的建议。他具体建议在今年年底组织反对“欧洲煤钢联营集团”的斗争周。
    在讨论儒丹的报告时，塞浦路斯五金工人代表萨查里阿斯指出，对塞浦路斯工人的野蛮剥削由于殖民压迫而特别厉害。那里没有保障工会权利和民主自由的法律。
    西哈克（捷克斯洛伐克）总结全欧工会会议的成就时着重指出，它又一次表明了千百万欧洲工人要求和平的渴望。
    卢森堡五金工人代表费拉包蒂谈到了卢森堡工人为反对使工人进一步贫困和资本家利润大大增加的“舒曼计划”而斗争的情况。
    在会上发言的还有：萨洛伊宁（芬兰）和约翰逊（国际民主妇女联合会）。
