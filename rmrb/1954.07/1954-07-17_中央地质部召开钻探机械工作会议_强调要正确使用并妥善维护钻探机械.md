    Central Geological Department Holds Drilling Machinery Work Conference
    Emphasizing the Correct Use and Proper Maintenance of Drilling Machinery
    The Central Geological Department recently convened a drilling machinery work conference in Zhangjiakou. A total of 159 representatives from geological bureaus, exploration teams, and prospecting machinery factories across the country attended the conference. The conference heard a report on drilling machinery work by Soviet expert Droppet, studied and exchanged work experiences, and conducted detailed discussions on how to strengthen the maintenance and proper use of drilling machinery to eliminate accidents.
    Since the drilling worker representative conference held in March this year, the quality of drilling work and drilling efficiency have improved to some extent. For example, Team 241 conscientiously implemented the suggestions of Soviet experts, established a mechanical department, and strengthened the maintenance and management of mechanical equipment, beginning to reverse the situation of frequent accidents and failure to complete tasks. However, on a national scale, the problem of frequent drilling accidents and low efficiency is still relatively serious. According to statistics for the first quarter of this year, the national drilling production plan was only 88.72% completed, and the downtime caused by accidents from January to May accounted for 23.55% of the total production time.
    After discussion, the conference unanimously agreed that the long-term failure to effectively solve the problem of frequent drilling accidents and low efficiency is mainly due to the insufficient understanding of the importance of correct use and proper protection of prospecting machinery and equipment by leaders, who did not fully understand that this is an important guarantee for completing geological exploration tasks; the improper use and poor maintenance of drilling machinery and equipment by various teams; the long-term lack of responsible leadership in repair workshops, chaotic workshop production, no regular maintenance system, no pre-inspection, and untimely troubleshooting after accidents; and insufficient education for employees in cherishing state property, abiding by labor discipline, and improving skills, leading to the continuous occurrence of phenomena such as employees not following operating procedures and not cherishing state property.
    The conference decided that, first of all, leaders of bureaus and teams must attach importance to the management, maintenance, and repair of mechanical equipment, strengthen political and ideological education for employees, and firmly establish the idea of cherishing state property and abiding by labor discipline. Secondly, employees should be regularly organized to conduct technical studies and continuously improve the technical level of workers. Thirdly, mechanical equipment must be used correctly, a regular maintenance system for mechanical equipment must be established, and equipment that has not yet been used should be properly stored. Fourthly, prospecting machinery factories should face the worksite and quickly master the major repair work of mechanical equipment; they should increase the production of spare parts and tools for main equipment, improve quality, and ensure the needs of the worksite.
    At the end of the conference, Song Ying, Deputy Minister of the Central Geological Department, delivered a closing speech, pointing out that the key to implementing the decisions of this conference lies in strengthening leadership and management, and especially requiring all worksites to strengthen safety production education for employees to prevent personal accidents.

    中央地质部召开钻探机械工作会议
    强调要正确使用并妥善维护钻探机械
    中央地质部最近在张家口市召开了钻探机械工作会议。出席会议的有全国各地质局、勘探队和探矿机械厂的代表共一百五十九人。会议听了苏联专家德罗裴特关于钻探机械工作的报告，研究和交流了工作经验，并对如何加强钻探机械的维护保养和正确使用以消灭事故，进行了详尽的讨论。
    从今年三月间召开钻探职工代表会议以后，钻探工作的质量和钻进效率有所提高，如二四一队认真贯彻苏联专家建议，建立了机械科，加强了对机械设备的维护和管理，开始扭转事故多和完不成任务的局面。但在全国范围说来，钻探事故多、效率低还是一个比较严重的问题。据今年第一季统计，全国钻探生产计划仅完成百分之八十八点七二，一至五月份因事故所造成的停钻时间占总生产时间的百分之二十三点五五。
    会议经过讨论，一致认为钻探事故多、效率低的问题长期得不到有效的解决，主要原因是领导人员对正确使用和妥善保护勘探机械设备的重要性认识不足，他们没有充分了解这是完成地质勘探任务的重要保证；各队对钻探机械设备使用不当，保养不善；修配车间长期无人负责领导，车间生产混乱，没有定期的检修制度，事先不检修，事后排除事故不及时；对职工进行爱护国家财产、遵守劳动纪律和提高技术的教育不够，职工中不遵守操作规程、不爱护国家财产的现象不断发生。
    会议决定：首先各局、队领导方面必须重视机械设备的管理和维护检修工作，加强对职工的政治思想教育，巩固地树立爱护国家财产和遵守劳动纪律的思想。其次应经常组织职工进行技术学习，不断地提高工人的技术水平。第三，对机械设备必须正确地使用，建立机械设备的定期检修制度，并应妥善保管尚未使用的设备。第四，探矿机械厂应面向工地，迅速掌握机械设备的大修工作；对主要设备的配件及工具，应增加产量，提高质量，保证工地的需要。
    会议最后由中央地质部副部长宋应致闭幕词，他指出：贯彻此次会议决定的关键在于加强领导和管理，并特别要求各工地加强对职工进行安全生产教育，防止人身事故的发生。（虹生）
