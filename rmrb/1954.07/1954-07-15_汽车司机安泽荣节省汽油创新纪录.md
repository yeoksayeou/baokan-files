    Automobile Driver An Zerong Sets New Record for Fuel Efficiency Innovation
    An Zerong, an automobile driver at the Yuncheng Central Station of the Shanxi Provincial Transportation Bureau, inspired by the spirit of Wang Chonglun's technical innovation, diligently studied technology and set a new record for fuel efficiency in automobile driving in the province.
      To reduce gasoline consumption, the Shanxi Provincial Transportation Bureau repeatedly called on all automobile drivers to study technology and create experience in saving gasoline. Automobile driver An Zerong realized that saving gasoline was an important part of reducing costs, so he began to study the performance of his car. Initially, he discovered that the "Wala mouth" of the cylinder head of the car was leaking air due to prolonged driving, which increased gasoline consumption. He flexibly replaced the cylinder head, reducing gasoline consumption per 100 kilometers from the quota target of 27 liters to 21.6 liters. After continued research, he adjusted the "circuit," thickened the live wire of the "motor vent meter," lowered the "oil float," and thickened the oil needle. This reduced the gasoline consumption per 100 kilometers to 18.63 liters, greatly breaking the quota target and setting a new provincial record for fuel efficiency.

    汽车司机安泽荣节省汽油创新纪录
    山西省运输局运城中心站汽车司机安泽荣，受到王崇伦技术革新精神的鼓舞，认真钻研技术，创该省汽车行驶节省汽油新纪录。
      为降低汽油消耗，山西省运输局一再号召全体汽车司机钻研技术，创造节省汽油的经验。汽车司机安泽荣认识到节省汽油是降低成本的重要一环，因此开始研究自己汽车的性能。最初发现车上缸盖的“瓦拉口”因行车过久而漏汽，因而加大了汽油的消耗，他就灵活地调换缸盖，使行车每百公里的汽油消耗由定额指标二十七公升降低到二十一点六公升。经过继续研究，调整了“电路”，并把“马达通气表”的火线加粗，再把“油浮子”放低，加粗油针，这样就使行车百公里的汽油消耗下降到十八点六三公升，大大地突破了定额指标，创全省节省汽油新纪录。
