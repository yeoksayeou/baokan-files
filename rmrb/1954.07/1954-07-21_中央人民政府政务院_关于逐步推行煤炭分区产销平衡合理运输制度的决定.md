    State Council of the Central People's Government
    Decision on Gradually Implementing a Coal Zonal Production and Sales Balance and Rational Transportation System
        (Adopted at the 220th Plenary Session of the State Council on July 1, 1954)
    With the development of national economic construction and the expansion of material circulation, the tasks of transportation, especially railway transportation, are becoming increasingly heavy. Since 1953, certain sections of the railway have begun to show a trend of not being able to fully meet transportation needs.
    In order to adapt to the increasing needs of national economic development and national defense construction for railway transportation, in addition to the planned improvement and strengthening of railway equipment capacity and the full utilization of the potential of existing railway equipment, it is also necessary to immediately take measures to gradually and resolutely eliminate unreasonable transportation in order to save national transportation capacity. An effective way to eliminate unreasonable transportation is to gradually implement a zonal production and sales balance and rational transportation system for various major materials. Therefore, the following decision is made:
    First, the zonal production and sales balance and rational transportation system will be implemented starting from the fourth quarter of this year (trial implementation in August and September), starting with coal, which has the largest output among industrial products and accounts for more than one-third of the national railway freight volume, and then gradually extended to other major materials. The Financial and Economic Committee of the State Council of the Central People's Government is responsible for promptly formulating interim measures for the zonal production and sales balance and rational transportation of coal and issuing them to various departments for implementation.
    Second, the implementation of the coal zonal production and sales balance and rational transportation system (hereinafter referred to as the coal rational transportation system) is not only a major reform in the transportation system, but also a major reform in the distribution system. In the process of implementation, there will inevitably be some difficulties. Therefore, in implementing the coal rational transportation system, the principle of gradualness, step-by-step promotion, and steady progress should be implemented. That is, starting from state-owned coal mines and unified allocation of local state-owned and joint state-private coal mines, and then gradually extended to other local state-owned, joint state-private, and larger private coal mines. For those who have difficulties in implementing the basic flow chart of coal zonal production and sales balance and rational transportation, some transitional measures should be stipulated in the rational transportation measures. In addition, the price difference problem in individual regions caused by the implementation of the coal rational transportation system, which falls within the scope of supply of the Coal Industry Building Materials Company, will temporarily maintain the original price to avoid affecting the burden of consumer units.
    Third, in order to ensure that the coal rational transportation system can be gradually and smoothly implemented, it is necessary to conduct extensive and in-depth publicity and explanation work to relevant personnel, coal-using units, and residential consumers. Explain to them the important significance and role of implementing the coal rational transportation system in improving the national economic planning, rationally using national resources, saving national transportation capacity, and promoting national socialist industrialization. Make everyone understand the importance of starting from the overall and long-term interests of the country, consciously overcoming certain temporary difficulties, and thus conscientiously implementing the rational transportation system.
    Fourth, in order to ensure the smooth implementation of the coal rational transportation system, various departments are required to carry out the following tasks:
      1. The Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government should promptly strengthen sales organizations according to work needs and the spirit of streamlining, examine the requirements of various departments in accordance with the national coal allocation plan and the coal zonal production and sales balance and rational flow chart, and do a good job in the zonal and rational supply of coal to regions and departments. Further investigate the product quality and uses of state-owned and central joint state-private coal mines, and assist major coal-using units in investigating the quantity, quality, and habits of coal use in various places, in order to gradually improve the quality of rational supply work. The financial and economic committees of relevant provinces and municipalities directly under the central government should gradually investigate the product quality, uses, and supply and marketing laws of local state-owned, local joint state-private, and larger private coal mines that require railway and waterway transportation, and report the results of the investigation to the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government in order to gradually incorporate them into the national rational flow.
    2. All coal-using units and the Coal Industry Building Materials Company of the Ministry of Commerce of the Central People's Government (hereinafter referred to as the Coal Building Company) should strengthen work planning, and promptly submit coal application plans and consignment plans in accordance with the basic flow of coal zonal production and sales. They should also organize the trial burning of substitute coal, secondary coal, and inferior coal from nearby coal mines according to the needs of their units, improve firing technology, gradually change coal-using habits, and, if necessary and possible, appropriately improve coal-burning equipment.
    In order to reduce repeated transportation, for units with large coal consumption supplied by the Coal Building Company, if their coal-using locations or coal storage locations are not at the same unloading station as the Coal Building Company's coal yard, the Coal Building Company is required to gradually adopt the method of direct delivery, transporting coal directly from the coal mine to the unloading station of the coal-using unit. Other units must also gradually change the method of first concentrating in one place and then transporting it out.
    3. According to the principle of rational use of transportation tools, waterways should be fully utilized wherever possible. Water transport departments should continue to improve business management, especially to improve port management, simplify consignment procedures, and reduce water transport costs, in order to facilitate the use of water transport by various units. In order to encourage the use of water transport and rationally use national transportation capacity, the Ministry of Communications of the Central People's Government and the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government are responsible for submitting a plan to reduce water transport costs and restrict long-distance transportation and counter-flow transportation of coal within July 1954, which will be submitted to the Financial and Economic Committee of the State Council of the Central People's Government for approval and implementation.
    Fifth, in order to ensure the effective implementation of the coal rational transportation system, strict supervision and inspection must also be carried out, and experience must be summarized in a timely manner to improve work. To this end, the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government, the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government, and the Ministry of Communications of the Central People's Government should conduct supervision from the perspective of material supply and transportation work, and the financial and economic committees of relevant provinces and municipalities directly under the central government and the central ministries should also regularly conduct inspections of their regions or departments and report quarterly to the Financial and Economic Committee of the State Council of the Central People's Government.
    Sixth, although the rational transportation system is implemented starting with coal, it will be gradually extended to various major materials such as grain and timber. To this end, the relevant central departments should immediately collect data, conduct research, create conditions, and prepare for implementation. The Ministry of Food of the Central People's Government and the Ministry of Forestry of the Central People's Government are required to submit a plan for the zonal production and sales balance and rational transportation of grain and timber to the Financial and Economic Committee of the State Council of the Central People's Government for review this year. For regionally allocated materials such as sand, stone, bricks, tiles, and lime, the financial and economic committees of relevant provinces and cities can organize local production and transportation departments to conduct research, and after full preparation, they can gradually implement the rational transportation system.

    中央人民政府政务院
    关于逐步推行煤炭分区产销平衡合理运输制度的决定
        （一九五四年七月一日政务院第二百二十次政务会议通过）
    随着国民经济建设的发展，物资流转的扩大，交通运输首先是铁路运输的任务是日益繁重了。一九五三年以来，铁路某些区段即已开始呈现出不能充分满足运输需要的趋势。
    为适应国民经济发展和国防建设对铁路运输日益增长的需要，除必须有计划地改善与加强铁路设备能力，并充分发挥现有铁路设备的潜力外，还必须立即采取措施，逐步而坚决地消灭不合理的运输，以节约国家运输能力。消灭不合理运输的有效办法，就是逐步推行各种主要物资的分区产销平衡合理运输制度。为此特作如下决定：
    第一、分区产销平衡合理运输制度自本年第四季度起（八、九两月试行）首先从工业品中产量最大，并占全国铁路货运量三分之一以上的煤炭开始推行，然后逐步推行到其他主要物资。责成中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会从速制定煤炭分区产销平衡合理运输暂行办法，颁发各部门执行。
    第二、推行煤炭分区产销平衡合理运输制度（以下简称煤炭合理运输制度），不仅是运输制度上的重大改革，而且更是分配制度上的重大改革，在推行过程中必将会遇到某些困难，因此，在推行煤炭合理运输制度时，应贯彻由宽到严、逐步推广、稳步前进的方针。即先从国营煤矿和统一分配的地方国营、公私合营煤矿着手，然后再逐步推广到其他地方国营、公私合营与较大的私营煤矿。对于某些执行煤炭分区产销平衡合理运输基本流向图确有困难者，在合理运输办法中应规定一些过渡办法。此外由于实行煤炭合理运输制度所引起的个别地区差价问题，属于煤业建筑器材公司供应范围者，暂时维持原价不变，以免影响消费单位的负担。
    第三、为保证煤炭合理运输制度能够逐步地、顺利地推行，必须对有关人员、用煤单位和居民消费者进行广泛深入的宣传解释工作。向他们说明实行煤炭合理运输制度，对提高国家经济计划性，合理使用国家资源，节约国家运输力，促进国家社会主义工业化的重要意义和作用。使大家懂得从国家整体利益和长远利益出发，自觉地克服某些暂时的困难，从而认真贯彻合理运输制度。
    第四、为保证煤炭合理运输制度的顺利执行，要求各部门进行下列工作：
      一、中央人民政府燃料工业部应根据工作需要和精简的精神迅速加强销售机构，依照国家煤炭分配计划及煤炭分区产销平衡合理流向图，审查各部门的要求，做好地区的和部门的煤炭分区合理供应工作。进一步查清国营和中央公私合营各煤矿的产品质量及用途，协助各主要用煤单位查清各地用煤数量、质量和习惯，以便逐步提高合理供应工作的质量。各有关省、直辖市财政经济委员会应逐步查清需要铁路和水路运输的地方国营、地方公私合营及较大的私营煤矿的产品质量、用途及其供销规律，并将调查结果报告中央人民政府燃料工业部，以便逐步将其纳入国家合理流向之内。
    二、各用煤单位及中央人民政府商业部煤业建筑器材公司（以下简称煤建公司）应加强工作计划性，根据煤炭分区产销基本流向及时提出煤炭申请计划和托运计划。并应根据本单位需要情况，组织就近煤矿的代用煤、次煤及劣质煤的试烧工作，提高烧火技术，逐步改变用煤习惯，在必要与可能时也可适当改善烧煤设备。
    为减少重复运输，凡由煤建公司供应的用煤量较大的单位，其用煤地点或储煤地点与煤建公司的煤场不在同一卸车站者，要求煤建公司逐步采取直接送货的办法，将煤炭从煤矿直接运到用煤单位的卸车站。其他单位也须逐步改变先集中一地然后又外运的办法。
    三、根据合理使用运输工具的原则，凡可利用水运者，应充分利用水运。水运部门应继续改善经营管理，特别要改善港务管理工作，简化托运手续，降低水运费用，以利各单位使用水运。为鼓励利用水运，合理使用国家运输能力，责成中央人民政府交通部、中央人民政府铁道部于一九五四年七月内提出降低水运费用和限制煤炭长距离运输和对流运输的运价方案，报经中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会核准执行。
    第五、为保证煤炭合理运输制度的切实推行，还必须进行严格的监督与检查，并及时总结经验以改进工作。为此，中央人民政府燃料工业部、中央人民政府铁道部和中央人民政府交通部应从物资供应上与运输工作上进行监督，各有关省、直辖市财政经济委员会与中央各部亦应经常地对本地区或本部门进行检查，并按季总结报告中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会。
    第六、合理运输制度虽从煤炭开始实行，但将逐步推行到各种主要物资如粮食、木材等方面。为此中央各有关部门应立即收集资料，进行研究，创造条件，准备推行。要求中央人民政府粮食部与中央人民政府林业部于今年内提出粮食、木材分区产销平衡合理运输方案送中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会审核。对地区性调拨的物资如沙、石、砖、瓦、石灰等，各有关省、市财政经济委员会可组织当地生产和运输部门进行研究，经过充分准备以后，即可逐步推行合理运输制度。
