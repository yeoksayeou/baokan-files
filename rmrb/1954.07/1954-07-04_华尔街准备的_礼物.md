Wall Street Prepares a "Gift"
	Li Daokui

	A United Press dispatch from Washington on June 16th stated: The U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill stipulating that the United States "will ship surplus agricultural products worth $1.3 billion to foreign countries over the next three years, without getting a single penny in return." -- Sending $1.3 billion worth of agricultural products away and not wanting "a single penny" in return, are the U.S. congressmen really so generous?
	Things are naturally not so simple.
	The United Press dispatch continued to report: This bill will allow "agricultural products worth $1 billion to be 'sold' in exchange for foreign currency," and then "this foreign currency will be used by the United States to purchase strategic materials abroad, fund foreign economic and military aid programs, and for other purposes." (Please note this "other purposes"!) "In addition, the bill stipulates that surplus grain worth $300 million will be given completely free (??) to hungry people in foreign countries." Subsequently, the House of Representatives also "passed an amendment stipulating that products must be labeled as 'gifts from the American people' whenever feasible (showing that the congressmen also anticipated that there would be 'times when it wouldn't be feasible'!)"
	The issue is not completely clarified here, because everyone knows that many of the real American people are starving today, and they really cannot afford to send such "gifts." In February, the U.S. authorities had to admit that there were 3.7 million fully unemployed people in the United States (according to the estimate of Academician Varga of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, the actual number is around 6 million). In January of this year, U.S. Senator Morse of Oregon admitted that more and more people in the United States are starving today. He said: "The number of unemployed people is increasing in many parts of the United States. Therefore, we have many compatriots who, even if they receive unemployment relief, do not have enough food to feed their families properly."
	Please go back and continue reading the United Press dispatch from Washington on June 16th:
	“American congressmen who support this huge disposal plan” said: “This plan is very necessary because export markets have shrunk,” especially “surplus products will be damaged if they are not utilized.”
	Alright, now the true face of the American "philanthropist" is completely exposed! It turns out that the U.S. congressmen want to package the economic crisis as "aid" that "doesn't take back a single penny," and as a "completely free" "gift" to foreign countries. Naturally, the U.S. ruling authorities can also use this "aid" to intensify the arms race in other countries, and can also use this "gift" with the trademark misappropriating the name of the "American people" to exchange for military bases, arms orders, and military agreements. In Western parlance, this is truly a good idea to "kill two birds with one stone"!
	It must be admitted that compared to the era of economic crisis in capitalist countries more than twenty years ago, when tens of thousands of tons of wheat and coffee were thrown into the sea for nothing, today's Wall Street bosses and their strategists have become "smarter." But unfortunately, the U.S. congressmen's wishful thinking will not always encounter "feasible times." The reason is also very simple: even if arsenic is coated with sugar, it is still a poisonous drug, not a candy. In the years after the war, the people in those countries who received the "benevolence" of "U.S. aid" have tasted enough of the "aid" and "gifts" from the United States from the "Marshall Plan," the "Truman Point Four Program," and so on! People have understood that accepting this so-called "aid" and "gift" means that their country will lose its freedom and independence.
	Therefore, now these "aids" and "gifts" are already not very "feasible," and will become increasingly "unfeasible." (Attached image)

    华尔街准备的“礼物”
    梨稻葵
    合众社六月十六日自华盛顿发出的一则电讯说：美国众议院通过一项法案，这项法案规定，美国“在今后三年中把价值十三亿美元的剩余农产品运往外国。而一个铜板也不拿回来。”——十三亿美元的农产品送出去，而“一个铜板”也不要，美国的议员先生们果真是这么慷慨么？
    事情自然不会如此简单。
      合众社电讯继续报道说：这个法案将准许把“价值十亿美元的农产品
  ‘卖出’以换取外国货币”，然后“这种外国货币将被美国用来在国外购买战略物资，资助对外的经济和军事援助计划以及用于其他用途。”（请注意这个“其他用途”！）“此外，这个法案规定把价值三亿美元的剩余粮食完全免费地（？）赠给外国饥饿的人”。接着众议院还“通过一项修正案，规定凡在行得通的时候（可见议员先生们也预料到有‘行不通的时候’！）就必须标明产品是‘美国人民的礼物’”。
    问题到这里还没有完全交代清楚，因为人们都知道今天真正的美国人民很多都在挨饿，他们实在送不起这样的“礼物”。二月间美国当局不得不承认美国完全失业者已有三百七十万人（据苏联科学院瓦尔加院士的估计，实际上当在六百万人左右）。今年一月间，美国俄勒冈州的参议员莫尔斯就曾承认，美国今天挨饿的人愈来愈多。他说：“在美国许多地方失业人数正在增加。因此，我们有许多同胞，即令是得到了失业救济金，也还没有足够的食物来好好地养活他们的家属。”
    请再回头继续读合众社六月十六日自华盛顿发出的电讯：
      “支持这个巨大的处理计划”的美国议员先生说：“这个计划是很必要的，因为出口市场已经缩小，”特别是“剩余品将会损坏，如果不对它们加以利用的话。”
    好了，至此美国“慈善家”的嘴脸完全暴露了！原来美国议员先生们想把经济危机包装成“一个铜板也不拿回来”的“援助”品，包装成“完全免费”的“礼物”送到外国去。自然，美国统治当局还同时可以通过这种“援助”来加紧别国的扩军备战，还可以利用这种盗用“美国人民”的名义作为商标的“礼物”来交换军事基地、军火订单、军事协定。用西方的成语说，这真是“一块石头打死两只鸟”的好主意！
      必须承认，比起二十多年前资本主义国家经济危机时代，把成万吨的小麦、咖啡白白地扔到大海里去，今天的华尔街老板和他们的策士们是变得
  “聪明”些了。但可惜的是美国议员先生们的如意算盘总不会经常碰到“行得通的时候”。道理也很简单：砒霜即使加上糖衣也还是毒人的药物，而不是水果糖。战后几年来，受到“美援”“恩惠”的那些国家的人们，已经从
  “马歇尔计划”、“杜鲁门第四点计划”等等计划中，尝够了美国的“援助”和美国的“礼物”的滋味了！人们已经懂得接受这种所谓“援助”和
  “礼物”是意味着他们的国家将丧失自由和独立。
    因此，现在这些“援助”和“礼物”已经是不大“行得通”的时候了，而且愈来将愈“行不通”。（附图片）
