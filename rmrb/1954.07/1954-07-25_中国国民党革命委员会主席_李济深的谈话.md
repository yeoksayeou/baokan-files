    The negotiations at the Geneva Conference on the issue of the cessation of hostilities and the restoration of peace in Indochina have reached an agreement. This is another victory for resolving international disputes through peaceful consultation and another proof that the forces of peace will surely overcome war. We fully agree with and support these agreements.

    During the seventy-five days of negotiations on restoring peace in Indochina, thanks to the unwavering struggle for peace by our delegation, the Soviet Union, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam delegation, which was enthusiastically supported by the vast number of peace-loving people around the world, the conspiracy of the American ruling clique to directly intervene and expand the war in Indochina and its attempts to obstruct and sabotage the Geneva Conference in every possible way were finally thwarted, and the agreement was finally achieved. The great victory of this struggle is a victory for our government's consistent peaceful diplomatic policy and our 600 million people's struggle for peace in Asia and the world. The Chinese delegation, headed by Premier and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai, negotiated major international issues with other major powers as a delegation representing one of the world's major powers, demonstrated China's firm and unwavering peaceful diplomatic policy, and made outstanding contributions to this international conference. We are immensely excited by their hard work and the significant achievements they have made, and I would like to express my highest respect to them on behalf of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang.

    The international status of the People's Republic of China as one of the world's major powers has been universally recognized, and our international prestige has been greatly enhanced. At the same time, it also shows that the role and responsibility that our country plays and bears in international affairs are extremely significant. Although the war policy of the American ruling clique has suffered another disgraceful defeat this time, we must still be vigilant to prevent any conspiracy to undermine peace in Indochina and be ready at any time to crush all its evil attempts to be hostile to the Chinese people.

    From this victory, we have a deeper understanding of the strength of the world's peace forces. We firmly believe that as long as we and the peace-loving people of the world are closely united and take on the cause of peace, we will continue to win victories!

    中国国民党革命委员会主席
    李济深的谈话
    日内瓦会议关于印度支那停战和恢复和平问题的谈判，已经达成了协议。这是用和平协商方式解决国际争端的又一次胜利，是和平力量一定战胜战争的又一次证明。我们完全同意和支持这些协议。
    在恢复印度支那和平问题的七十五天谈判当中，由于我国代表团和苏联以及越南民主共和国代表团坚决不渝地为争取和平而进行不懈的斗争，得到全世界广大爱好和平人民的热烈拥护和支持，终于挫败了美国统治集团直接干涉和扩大印度支那战争的阴谋和它对日内瓦会议千方百计的阻挠破坏而最后取得了协议。这一斗争的伟大胜利，是我国政府一贯的和平外交政策和我们六亿人民争取亚洲及世界和平的胜利。而以周恩来总理兼外交部长为首的我国代表团，以世界大国之一的代表团身份，与各大国一起协商重大国际问题，表现了我国坚定不移的和平外交政策，在这一次国际会议中作了卓越的贡献，他们的辛勤努力和所获得的重大成就，使我们感到无限兴奋，我谨代表中国国民党革命委员会对他们表示崇高的敬意。
    中华人民共和国作为世界大国之一的国际地位已经为举世所公认，我国的国际威望已经大大提高，同时也就表明了我国在国际事务中所起的作用和所负的责任是异常重大的。这一次美国统治集团的战争政策虽然又遭到可耻的失败，但我们还必须提高警惕，防止它任何破坏印度支那和平的阴谋，并随时准备粉碎它与中国人民为敌的一切罪恶企图。
    从这一次胜利，使我们更深刻地认识到世界和平力量的强大，我们深信，只要我们和全世界爱好和平的人民紧密团结在一起，把和平事业担当起来，我们必将不断获得胜利！
