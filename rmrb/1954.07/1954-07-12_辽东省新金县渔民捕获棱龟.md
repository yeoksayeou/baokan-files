    Liaoning Province, Xinjin County Fishermen Catch Leatherback Turtle

    In mid-June, the Fan Yuni fishery mutual aid team in Xinjin County, Liaoning Province, caught a leatherback turtle weighing more than 1,000 catties in the Piziwo sea area. This leatherback turtle is seven feet long, four feet wide at the back, and two feet five inches high. The Xinjin County People's Government has put this leatherback turtle into a wooden tank and placed it in seawater for breeding. Note: The leatherback turtle, also known as the leathery turtle, belongs to the vertebrate reptile class. It has a strange shape, is good at swimming, and is produced in tropical oceans. Leatherback turtle meat is high in fat and can be used to make oil.
