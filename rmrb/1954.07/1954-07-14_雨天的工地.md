    Rain on the Construction Site
    Ai Mingzhi
    June arrived at the construction site with wind and rain.
    Perhaps some people feel that walking in the hot weather, in the strong wind, and under the raindrops is a pleasure. However, for the people on the construction site, wind and rain are their enemies.
    This is China's first automobile factory. Last year has passed, and almost half of this year has passed. The remaining half-year is the day when the people participating in this construction project determine victory or defeat. The first three months of this half-year are the key to opening the door to victory.
    However, as soon as June arrived, it brought wind and rain. Could it be that this year's rainy season has arrived earlier than in previous years?
    I rushed from my accommodation to the construction site. The rain had lessened a bit. The gray-blue rain clouds in the sky were still dense. Only in the western part, a strong ray of sunlight broke through the rain clouds and shone down. Everything on the construction site looked very fresh and clear. The yellow reed mats, the red steel roof trusses, the date-colored brick walls, the dark gray winches, cranes, and dense scaffolding... all on the vast green grassland, all painted with a particularly charming color.
    The road was muddy from the rain, and the silt was biting at my shoes, making each step a bit of an effort. Horse-drawn carts and cars were often trapped in the mud. The wheels spun desperately, the engine roared angrily, the coachman shouted, the whip whistled, and the livestock cried sadly, all ringing out together. With great difficulty, the car escaped from the mud pit and drove away, the thick and sticky mud on the road spreading out like waves, layer upon layer, splashing mud stars.
    Now the construction site is very quiet. Besides the sound of the wind and rain, nothing else can be heard around. Concrete trucks, carts, wheelbarrows... are running in various places. Tractors are running. The workers are wearing raincoats and rain boots, working silently. Every sweaty and shiny face is flashing with a tense expression, they are saving the time for speaking and putting it on work.
    The loudspeaker suddenly rang:
    "Comrades on the roof, the section chief orders, please prepare to come down, there will be strong wind and heavy rain soon, the task is important, and safety is also important!"
    However, the crane still calmly and unhurriedly lifted the huge steel roof truss gently. A short, sturdy little fat man shouted at the loudspeaker:
      "No hurry! We have fastened our safety belts, wait until the rain gets heavier!"
    I found the branch secretary of a certain work section. This is a young man in his twenties, who used to be a political instructor in the army. When he saw me, he smiled and extended his hand, saying:
    "It's the seventh day, this rain seems to be racing against us!"
    "Can we win?" I asked.
    He pushed his hat to the back of his head and said decisively: "Yes!"
    "It looks like it will rain for a few more days!" I reminded him.
    He looked up at the sky. The rain clouds in the sky were moving quickly, squeezing around, as if discussing: Hey! When shall we give it a good downpour again. I don't know why, he suddenly curled his lip at the sky, and then said:
    "There are difficulties, without difficulties, victory cannot be won! The wind and rain are merciless, now it depends on our people!"
    "How do people feel?"
    He smiled and said: "Ten fingers are of different lengths, of course, some people have less confidence. They say: For many years, you can't work in the rain. They say: In windy and rainy weather, high-altitude operations are windy and rainy, and your feet are slippery, you can't work; digging earthworks, there is water, you can't work. Concrete pouring is also not possible. But, now you see," he made a semi-circular gesture towards the construction site with his hand: "High-altitude, earthwork, concrete, bricklaying, ... all are going on. These comrades also answered simply: 'Don't say it's raining,' they said: 'Even if it hails, we can't delay the task!'..."
    He glanced at me and suddenly lowered his voice:
    "What we need to pay attention to now is not to let them go too far. Everyone is saying that completing the plan is not enough, this month is over and it will be 'July 1st', and we have to offer an extra gift!"
    A red cloth banner was hung on the large column in front of the construction site, the wind and rain were blowing it, only these few words could be seen: "Increase production by two billion, as a gift to the Party's birthday on 'July 1st'!" He led me to sit down on a concrete pillar, and said:
    "Our leaders have confidence because we have such a group of people, when the Party gives them a task, they don't say: 'It's difficult, let us complete 80 percent!' but say: 'Okay! We will complete it at 200 percent, no, 300 percent, 400 percent!'"
    "For example, these hoisting workers," he pointed to the roof, "they come from different places, Shanghai, Chongqing, Wuhan... people from all over the country have come. Their experiences are also different. These people, now put together, have created miracles. We have revised the quota twice, and they have broken through every time! Not a little bit, but several times over!
    Let me tell you about this person. His name is Qiang Kouzi. He used to be a hoisting worker in Shanghai, he had a job, and he earned a lot of work points. His wife was pregnant, but when he heard the news of the construction of the automobile factory, he came despite his wife's opposition.
    At that time, we had many difficulties. On this land, there were only sorghum stubble, bean dregs, wormwood, and earth mounds. Everything had to be started from scratch. Once everyone came, this place changed. It changed really fast, every day was different. It was the first time that Qiang Kouzi and the others had been to the Northeast, they had heard about the severe winter, but they had never seen it or experienced it. The snow was a foot or two deep. Holding the steel cable, it would freeze in a while, and a hard pull would tear off the skin. Their hands were swollen from the cold. The crane was difficult to move on the snow, so they used straw mats to cushion the snow, rolling it section by section. The soil was frozen like iron, so they poured boiling water on it, and only after the ice melted did they start digging. The daily quota for hoisting large concrete pillars was eight, but they hoisted forty. The quota for steel roof trusses was thirteen bays, but they completed twenty-three bays."
    Speaking of this, the branch secretary moved closer to me, without speaking, he just laughed first.
      "There was also a joke about this." He continued: "One morning, the chairman of the trade union, Lao Wu, got out of bed and saw that it was 5:30, so he rang the bell to wake everyone up. The bell rang for a long time, but no one came out. He ran to where Qiang Kouzi and the others lived and saw that everyone was gone. He was very shocked and thought they had deserted. He hurried to find our deputy branch secretary, Lao Zhang.
    'Everyone is gone!'
    Lao Zhang asked: 'Who exactly are they?'
    'Qiang Kouzi and the others. They're all gone.'
    When Lao Zhang heard it was them, he felt a little more at ease. He understood this group of young men. 'That can't be, let's go to the construction site and see.'
    They took off their shoes and left. Sure enough, Qiang Kouzi and the others were all working on the construction site! They came at 3:30.
    We said: 'This won't do! Isn't this working overtime?'
    They said: 'This doesn't count, we didn't really work, we just prepared the tools and stuff, and we'll start when the time comes!'
    Look, what can you say about these comrades! Later I asked them why they were working so hard. What they said was really good:
    'Secretary, our hoisting is the first process, if we don't work fast, the thirty-odd processes below will have to crane their necks and wait. When will we be able to see the cars we made and hear their horns!'
    I haven't finished telling you about Qiang Kouzi's story! When he came, didn't his wife object? After he came, Qiang Kouzi wrote letters to his wife, but none of them were returned. She was angry. During the Spring Festival, the construction site stopped work, so we persuaded Qiang Kouzi to say:
    'Go back and take a look, get your wife to see reason, and then come back.'
    Qiang Kouzi went back. When his wife saw him, she was very happy at first, but then she saw that Qiang Kouzi didn't bring all his luggage back, so she asked:
    'Do you still have some things?'
    'Left at the construction site.'
    'You're going back?'
    'Going back.'
    'Qiang Kouzi,' his wife called out: 'Let me tell you honestly, if you go back, we'll get a divorce, I can't be left alone here!'
    No matter how Qiang Kouzi tried to tell her, it didn't work. At night, when Qiang Kouzi fell asleep, she secretly hid Qiang Kouzi's employee card. The next day, Qiang Kouzi discovered it and took it out, but she grabbed it and bit it in her mouth! She wanted to keep the employee card so she could keep Qiang Kouzi's heart.
    Qiang Kouzi was not kept. He said to his wife:
   'Don't do this, there's work waiting for me on the construction site! Food, clothes, whatever money you need, I'll prepare it all, and I can come back to see you every year, let me go.'
    Seeing that she couldn't shake Qiang Kouzi's determination, she left the child at home and went back to her mother's house.
    'Okay, if you want to go back, we'll each make our own plans, I won't take care of the child anymore.'
    The child was only two months old, and everything from feeding to defecating needed someone to take care of. Qiang Kouzi, this young man, now had to be not only a father but also a mother. He didn't sleep well for days and nights, taking care of the child. His heart was very sad. 'Why are you holding me back like this?' he thought. Then he said to himself: 'No, even if I lose my wife, I can't lose the construction site.'
    At that time, people who returned to Shanghai wrote letters back, and we were all worried that Qiang Kouzi wouldn't return. Some people in Shanghai also advised him to forget it, it's not hard to find a job in Shanghai, there's no need to lose your wife and children and go to suffer the cold and hardship! But, when the vacation was about to end, we saw him again among the people who were reporting back. He found a kind person who promised to take good care of his child, and rushed back."
    I asked the branch secretary to accompany me to find him. He looked like a very honest young man, with a smooth face and a small black mole by his mouth. His hands were thick and strong.
    I asked him why he was so determined to come back. He thought for a while, with an apologetic smile, he said awkwardly:
    "I can't explain it clearly. I was very distressed at that time. But the heart to come back has never wavered. It seems like there is a voice calling me back."
    "What voice?" I asked.
    "I, I can't explain it clearly." He smiled uneasily, as if he felt bad for not satisfying my question.
    "Have you received any letters from your wife recently?"
    "Yes." A light flashed across his face.
    "Is she still so determined to hold you back?"
    "No, she even greeted me in the letter and blamed herself for not being so unreasonable at the beginning." He smiled lightly.
    After we left him, the branch secretary said to me again:
    "We can cite many such people. There are more people who have done a lot of work, but we haven't had time to discover them. Political work can't keep up!"
    I left the branch secretary. The rain continued to fall. The people on the construction site also continued to work. Concrete pouring work continued, digging continued, hoisting continued. ... The shovel was stuck with mud into a large earth hammer, and some people abandoned the shovel and began to dig with their hands. On the slippery springboard, people pushed small carts and ran, and people picked up earth baskets and ran. Many digging workers who were half-submerged in the mud had swollen arms, but no one wanted to come down and rest. The excavator relentlessly stretched out its iron claws, grabbed chunks of earth, and scattered them far away. …
    I walked around. I thought of many people and things I saw and heard. An old engineer, who in the past endured the ridicule of others in university and chose to study automobile manufacturing, and later went abroad to study and practice. For decades, he never had the opportunity to participate in the work he was passionate about. I can't forget his trembling lips and shining eyes when he described his work at the automobile factory.
    I suddenly thought of the two young girls who came to our room to chat one night. One was named Tang Huifang and the other was named Zhang Qin. They were both graduates of a nursing school in the south, and before leaving school, they had never been to a further place. They were only eighteen or nineteen years old, and their faces still carried the simple expression of children.
    That night, they wore the same purple-red lapel shirts. Zhang Qin had a pencil and a white copper spoon for eating in her upper pocket; Tang Huifang kept spinning my hat with one finger like a windmill while talking. They were not yet adults after all.
      "At graduation," Zhang Qin began to describe their journey here, saying: "The school asked us for our opinions on the location of work, and we all filled in: 'Obey the allocation of the motherland'! We were assigned to Beijing, and we were extremely happy. Beijing, what a great place! What better place could we hope to go to? Not long after, we suddenly received a notice asking us to come to the Northeast."
    Speaking of this, Zhang Qin glanced at Tang Huifang, as if soliciting her opinion on whether to continue.
      "Alas, we had to leave Beijing. We were reluctant. What is the Northeast like? In our imagination, it is farther and colder than any other place. We were a little unwilling, but we are members of the Youth League, so we held a group meeting, of course, we consciously obeyed. The three comrades who stayed in Beijing came to see us off, and we all cried when the train was about to leave."
     Tang Huifang, who was spinning her hat while sitting on the side, suddenly called out:
    "Didn't cry!"
    "Cried!"
    "Those were four of you crying, I didn't cry!" Tang Huifang said with a solemn statement.
    "Anyway, we cried," Zhang Qin grumbled: "We can't explain why we cried. After the train left, someone came to ask us:
    'Why were you crying just now?' We didn't say anything.
    'Do you know where you are going?'
    We don't know.
    'We are together, we are all transferred to the First Automobile Manufacturing Factory!' the person said.
    We jumped up: 'Really?'
    'Who can lie to you!'
    We shouted, laughed, and clapped our hands. We started playing 'pat the knees'."
    "When we arrived at the construction site, we were eager to ask for work assignments. I was assigned to the construction site. There was nothing on the construction site at that time. The first time I was on duty at night, I was really scared, so I asked a comrade to accompany me, but I was still scared. I could only hear sounds outside, I didn't know what they were, the sound of the wind? The sound of a dog barking? They sounded a bit like that, but they didn't sound like that when I listened closely. That night seemed particularly long.
    Once, a worker suddenly fell ill in the middle of the night, so I accompanied the doctor on a house call. It was the dead of winter. The snow in the Northeast, like cotton wool, fell down piece by piece, and it didn't melt on our bodies for a long time. The doctor was anxious to see the patient and walked very fast. I was originally famous for being quick: quick at talking, quick at eating, quick at running, but this time I fell behind. I was really scared in my heart, that snowfield was like someone had opened a big white pocket, and wanted to drag me away. I fell I don't know how many times, sometimes I thought it was a flat ground, but when I stepped on it, it was a snow pit, and it took me a long time to climb out. …"
    "Did you catch up with the doctor in the end?" I couldn't help laughing.
    "I did catch up. Of course, my hands and feet were numb from the cold when I came back that day, and someone helped me pull off my boots. These are all things of the past, and now I'm not afraid of anything."
    At the moment when I thought of these two young girls, I was passing under a row of steel roof trusses that were twenty-four meters high. The steel roof trusses, painted with red lead, vaguely resisted the gray sky. The wind was still very strong, and I was swaying by it as I walked on the ground. The steel roof trusses架 on the concrete pillars also seemed to be swaying a bit. On the steel roof trusses, there were some young men and women, wearing safety belts, climbing around on top, constantly tapping the steel beams with small pickaxes. They were all interns from the industrial university. There was a female student, with a small round face and two black and shiny braids. When she squatted down, the braids were even longer than her, and the pointed ends of her hair were brushed back and forth in the wind. She noticed that I was paying attention to her, blushed, and turned her head away. She seemed to be only seventeen or eighteen years old. Hey, if you went back a few years, at their age, even if you helped them onto a bicycle, they would scream in fright. Now they have gone so far.
    I lingered on the construction site until late at night before leaving. The rain stopped for a while, then started again. The raindrops turned into silver, shining broken lines in the dark night. In front of me was a city, now the lights were sparse, people were asleep, and everything was resting. Behind me, the construction site was brightly lit, and the sounds of various machines were singing the praises of our era.

    雨天的工地
    艾明之
    六月带着风雨来到了工地。
    也许有人觉得，在暑热天气，到大风里，到雨点下走走，是一种愉快。可是，对工地上的人说来，风雨却是他们的敌人。
    这儿是中国第一座汽车厂。去年一年过去了，今年半年快过去了，剩下的半年，是参加这个建设工程的人，决定胜败的日子。这半年的前三个月，又是打开胜利的门的钥匙。
    可是，六月一来，就带来了风雨。难道今年的雨季，比往年提早来到了么？
    我从住宿的地方，赶到工地去。雨小了一点。天上灰青色的雨云，仍旧密密层层。只在偏西的地方，有一股强烈的日光，突破雨云，照到下面来。工地上的一切，显得非常新鲜、清晰了。黄的席棚、红的钢屋架、枣色的砖墙、深灰色的卷扬机、起重机、密密的脚手架……在广阔的绿色的草地上，这一切都抹上一层特别魅人的色彩。
    道路被雨浇得泥泞不堪，淤泥使劲咬着鞋子，每走一步，都得费点气力。马拉大车和汽车常常陷在泥里。车轮绝望地打转，马达愤怒地吼着，赶大车的叱喝，鞭子的唿哨，以及牲口的悲叫，一齐响起来。车子好容易脱出了泥坑，开走了，路上又厚又粘的泥浆，就跟波浪一样，一层一层地向周围推开，溅起了泥星子。
    现在工地上却很静。周围除了风声雨声，听不见别的。混凝土车、大车、手推车、……在各个地方奔跑。拖拉机在奔跑。工人们穿了雨衣、雨鞋，默默地工作。每张汗湿的发亮的脸，都闪着紧张的神情，他们把说话的时间都节约下来放在工作上。
    扩音机忽然响起来：
    “屋面上的同志，工段长命令，请你们准备下来吧，马上又有大风大雨，任务要紧，安全也要紧！”
    可是，起重机依然从容不迫地把巨大的钢屋架，轻轻举上去。有一个矮矮的结实的小胖子，对着扩音机叫：
      “不忙！安全带我们都拴紧啦，等雨下大了再说！”
    我找到某工段的支部书记。这是个二十来岁的年青人，原来在部队当指导员。他看见我，就笑着伸过手来说：
    “第七天啦，这个雨好像要跟我们赛一赛哩！”
    “我们赛得过吗？”我问。
    他把帽子推到后脑勺上，斩钉截铁地说：“能！”
    “看样子还得下几天哩！”我提醒他。
    他抬头望望天。天上雨云飞快地飘动着，挤来挤去，好像在商量：嗨！我们什么时候好好的再下它一家伙。不知道为了什么，他忽然向天空撇了撇嘴皮，然后说：
    “困难是有的，没有困难，胜利就赢不来！风雨是不留情的，现在就要看我们的人啦！”
    “大家觉得怎么样？”
    他笑了笑说：“十个指头伸出来有长短，当然也有人信心不高的。他们说：多少年了，从来雨天就不能干活。他们说：风雨天，高空作业风大雨大，脚下滑，不能干；挖土方，有水，不能干。混凝土灌浇也不行。可是，现在你看，”他用手向工地划了一个半弧形：“高空、土方、混凝土、砌砖，……都干起来了。这些同志答的也干脆：‘别说下雨，’他们说：‘就是下雹子，我们也不能误了任务！’……”
    他看了我一眼，忽然放低声音：
    “现在要注意的，就是别让他们过分了。大家都在说，完成计划不算，这个月完了就是‘七一’，还得超额献一份礼哩！”
    工地前的大柱上，挂了一幅红布标语，风雨吹打着它，仅仅看得出这几个字：“增产二十亿，向‘七一’党的生日献礼！”他引我在一个混凝土柱子上坐下，一面说：
    “我们领导上是有信心的，因为我们有这样一批人，党交给他们一个任务，他们不说：‘困难啊，让我们完成百分之八十吧！’而是说：‘行！我们照百分之二百，不，三百、四百完成它！’”
    “譬如这些吊装工人，”他朝屋顶指了一指，“他们从不同的地方来，上海的、重庆的、武汉的……全国各地都来了人啦。他们的经历也都不同。这些人，现在碰在一起，就创造了奇迹，我们修改了两次定额，他们每次都突破！不是突破一点，而是几倍几倍地突破！
    我就给你说说这个人吧。他叫强扣子，他本来在上海做吊装工人，有工作，挣的工分也不少，女人才有了孕，听到建设汽车厂的消息，不顾女人的反对，他来了。
    那时我们困难多啊。在这块地上，只有高粱楂子、豆楂、蒿草、土包包。什么都得平地起家。大家一来，这地方就变啦。变得真快，一天一个样子。强扣子他们第一次到东北，冬天的严寒，听说过，可没有见过，挨过。雪有一两尺深。手拉着钢绳，一会就冻结住了，用力一扯，连皮也扯下来。他们的手都冻肿了。起重机在雪地上不好走，他们用草席垫在雪上，一段一段的滚。土冻的像铁似的，他们用开水浇，冰化了，才动手挖。大混凝土柱子，每天定额吊装八根，他们吊装了四十根。钢屋架定的十三櫺，他们完成二十三櫺。”
    说到这里，支部书记朝我跟前挪了一挪，没有说话，先就笑起来。
      “这里面还有过一桩笑话。”他接着说：“有一天早上，工会主席老吴起了床，一看五点半了，就打钟叫大家起来。钟打了半天，没有人出来。他跑到强扣子他们住的地方一看，人全没了。他吃了一大惊，当作他们开小差了。赶紧就来找我们的副支书老张。
    ‘人都没了！’
    老张问：‘到底是那些人？’
    ‘强扣子他们。都没了。’
    老张一听是他们，心里安定了一些。他了解这一班小伙子。‘不会吧，我们到工地看看去。’
    他们拔了鞋子就走。可不是，强扣子他们都在工地干活哩！三点半就来了。
    我们说：‘这不行啊！这不是加班加点吗？’
    他们说：‘这不能算，我们又没正经干活，只是把工具什么的，准备妥，到时候就动手！’
    你看，这些同志，你还能说什么呢！后来我问他们，为什么能这么起劲的干。他们说的真好：
    ‘书记啊，我们吊装是第一道工序，要不快干，下面三十几道工序都得伸起脖子等着。这样啥时候我们才能看到自己做的汽车，才能听到它的喇叭响哦！’
    强扣子的事我还没有说完哩！来的时候，他的女人不就反对吗？来了以后，强扣子给他女人写信，一封也没有回的。她生气了。春节的时候，工地停工，我们就劝强扣子说：
    ‘回去看看吧，把女人思想打通了再回来。’
    强扣子回去了。他女人见了他，才见面很高兴，后来看强扣子并没有把全部行李带回去，便问：
    ‘你还有些东西呢？’
    ‘留在工地了。’
    ‘你还要回去？’
    ‘要回去。’
    ‘强扣子，’他女人叫：‘我老实跟你说，你要回去，我们就离婚，把我一个人孤零零地丢在这里可不行！’
    强扣子怎么跟她说也不行。晚上强扣子睡着了，她偷偷地把强扣子的职工证藏了。第二天被强扣子发觉，找了出来，她却一把抢过来，咬在嘴里不放！她想留住职工证，就能留住强扣子的心。
    强扣子没有被留住。他对他女人说：
   ‘你不要这样，工地上有工作等着我哩！吃的，穿的，要花什么钱，我都给准备得好好的，每年我还可以回来看你，你让我去吧。’
    她看看动摇不了强扣子的决心，就把孩子丢在家里，回她娘家去了。
    ‘好吧，你要回去，我们就各想各的章程吧，孩子我也不管了。’
    孩子才两个月，吃奶拉屎，全都得人照看。强扣子，这个年青小伙子，他现在不仅要做爸爸，还得做妈妈哩。他几天几宿不曾好好睡，照顾着孩子。他的心很难受。‘为什么这样拖我后腿呢？’他想。接着又跟自己说：‘不行，我就是丢了老婆，也不能丢了工地。’
    那时候，同回上海的人，写信回来，我们都担心，强扣子不会回来了。上海也有人劝他，算了吧，在上海找个工作也不愁，犯不着丢了老婆孩子，跑去挨冷受累！但是，假期快满的时候，在销假的人当中，我们又看到他。他找到一个好心的人，答应好好看养他的孩子，又赶回来了。”
    我请支部书记陪我去找他。看样子是一个很老实的年青人，光光的脸，嘴边有一颗小黑痣，他的手厚而且有力。
    我问他为什么这样坚决地回来。他想了一想，浮着抱歉的笑容，讷讷地说：
    “我说不清楚。那时我是很苦恼的。要回来的心却一刻也没有动过。好像有一个什么声音，叫唤我回来。”
    “什么声音呢？”我问。
    “我，我说不清楚。”他不安地笑着，好像因为没有满足我的问题而难受。
    “你爱人最近有信来吗？”
    “有。”他脸上闪过一道亮光。
    “她现在还是那样坚决拖你吗？”
    “不了，她信里还向我打招呼，怪自己当初不应该这样。”他轻轻笑着说。
    我们离开他后，支部书记又对我说：
    “这样的人，我们可以举出很多来。有更多的人，他们做了很多工作，我们却还来不及发现。政治工作赶不上啊！”
    我离开支部书记。雨继续下着。工地上的人们也继续在工作。混凝土浇灌工作在继续，挖土在继续，吊装在继续。……铁锹被泥块黏成一个大土锤了，有人丢开铁锹，开始用手来挖。在泞滑的跳板上，人们推了小车在飞奔，挑了土筐在飞奔。许多半身陷在泥浆里的挖土工人，胳臂都肿了，没有人愿意下来休息。挖土机毫不示弱的把它的铁爪伸出来，抓起土块，远远撒出去。……
    我在各处走。我想到许多我看到和听到的人和事。一个老工程师，过去在大学里，忍了别人的讪笑，选修汽车制造系，以后又到外国去留学，实习。几十年了，他却始终没有机会参加他所醉心的工作。我忘不了他叙述自己到汽车厂来工作时，那颤动的嘴唇和发亮的眼睛。
    我忽然想到，有天晚上，到我们房间来谈天的两个年青姑娘。一个叫唐惠芳，一个叫张琴。她们都是南方一个护士学校的毕业生，在离开学校前，她们没有到过更远的地方。她们都还只有十八九岁，在她们脸上，都还带着小孩似的单纯的神情。
    那天晚上，她们穿了同样的紫红色的翻领衬衫。张琴的上衣口袋里，插了一支铅笔和一把吃饭用的白铜羹匙；唐惠芳在说话当中，一直用一支手指头，顶着我的帽子，像风车一样打转。她们毕竟还不是大人哩。
      “毕业的时候，”张琴开始叙述她们来这里的经过说：“学校征求我们对工作地点的意见，我们都填了：‘服从祖国分配’！我们被分配到北京，都高兴极啦。北京，这是一个多么好的地方！我们还能希望到什么更好的地方去呢？过了不久，忽然又来了通知，要我们到东北来。”
    说到这里，张琴看了唐惠芳一眼，好像征求她的意见，是否说下去。
      “唉，要离开北京了。我们舍不得。东北是什么样的呢？在我们想像中，它比任何地方都更远更冷。我们心里有些不情愿，但我们是团员啊，开了个小组会，当然，我们自觉地服从了。留在北京的三个同志，来送我们，火车临开，我们都哭了。”
     坐在一旁转着帽子的唐惠芳，忽然叫起来：
    “没有哭！”
    “哭了！”
    “那你们四个人哭的，我可没哭！”唐惠芳咧着嘴，郑重声明。
    “反正是哭了，”张琴咕噜道：“我们也说不清为什么哭。火车开了以后，有人来问我们：
    ‘你们刚才哭什么呢？’我们不出声。
    ‘你们知道到什么地方去吗？’
    我们不知道。
    ‘我们是一起的，都是调到第一汽车制造厂的啊！’那人说。
    我们跳了起来：‘真的吗？’
    ‘谁能骗你呢！’
    我们叫着，笑着，拍着手。开始玩拍膝头了。
    到了工地，我们急着要求分配工作。我被分配到工地。那时工地上什么也没有。第一次晚上值班，我真害怕，请了个同志陪我，还是害怕。只听得外面不知响的是什么声音，风声？狗叫声？都有点像，细听又都不像。那一夜，好像特别长。
    有一次，半夜工人急病，我随大夫出诊。那是深冬时候。东北的雪啊，像棉絮一样，一块一块往下掉，落在身上好久不化。大夫急着看病人，走的飞快，我原来出名的三快：说话快，吃饭快，跑路快，这次却落了后。我心里真害怕，那一片雪地，就像有人张了一只大白口袋，一下要把人蒙起拖走。我摔了不知多少跤，有时以为是一块平地，踩下去，却是一个雪坑，陷下去，半天才爬起来。……”
    “结果你赶上大夫了吗？”我不禁笑起来。
    “还是赶上了。当然那天回来，手脚都冻麻了，是别人帮我把靴子拉下来的。这些都是过去的事，现在我什么都不怕了。”
    就在我想起这两个年青姑娘的此刻，我正从一排二十四公尺跨度高的钢屋架下经过。抹着红丹的钢屋架，隐隐的抵着灰沉的天。风势依然很凶猛，我在地下走，不时被它刮的摇幌。架在混凝土柱子上的钢屋架，似乎也有点幌幌悠悠的。就在钢屋架上，却有一些青年男女，系着安全带，在顶上爬来爬去，不断地用小镐头敲着钢梁。他们都是工业大学的实习生。有一个女学生，小圆脸，留着两条又黑又亮的辫子，当她蹲下来时，辫子简直比她人还长，尖尖的发梢，在风里拂过来，拂过去。她发觉我在注意她，脸红了，把头转开。她看来才只有十七八岁。嘿，要是倒回去几年，在她们那个年纪，你就是扶着她们上脚踏车，也要惊的哇哇叫啊。现在她们却走的多么远了。
    我在工地上，一直逗留到夜深才走。雨停了一阵，又下起来了。雨点在黑夜里，变成银色的发亮的断线。在我前面，是一座城市，现在灯稀了，人睡了，一切都休息了。在我背后，工地上一片灯火辉煌，各种机器的响声，在高唱我们这个时代的赞歌。
