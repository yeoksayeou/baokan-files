    Defend the Motherland, Defend Peace
    Yang Zhenyu, Second-Class Combat Hero of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army
    As the first anniversary of the Korean armistice approaches, the news of the armistice and restoration of peace in Indochina has spread throughout the world. Peace has once again triumphed over war. The spirit of consultation has once again triumphed over the conspiracy of American imperialism to create war and maintain a tense situation. Like Korea a year ago, the people of Indochina, with the support of peace-loving people all over the world, have finally achieved a glorious peace.
    But how difficult it is to achieve peace!
    I cannot help but think of those fierce fighting days on the Korean battlefield. It was August of 1952. When the American imperialist invading army was blocked by the People's Army and the Volunteer Army near the 38th parallel and could not advance, the American air force frantically bombed Korean cities, villages, and all transportation lines, attempting to cut off our army's transportation routes. At that time, fierce air battles took place every day over the Chongchon River. Entrusted by the people of the motherland, our young Volunteer Air Force, with the determination to avenge the Korean people and protect the happiness and safety of the people of the motherland, bravely and resolutely attacked the enemy. On August 5th, we were waiting for orders at the airport when the signal flare for battle went up. I closely followed the lead plane and flew into the sky. When we spotted four F-86 enemy planes heading towards us, the cunning enemy tried to escape upon seeing us. We maintained our formation tightly and chased after them closely. At that time, I had only one thought in my mind: "Don't let the enemy escape." The enemy finally appeared in my gunsight. I opened fire, watching it fall to the ground. My lead plane also damaged an enemy plane. The third day, the battle began again. Fan Wanzhang, a special-class meritorious officer who had shot down three enemy planes and damaged one, encountered four enemy planes and was entangled in a dogfight. He shot down one, but the enemy continued to attack him. His plane was hit and caught fire. However, in order to continue to cover friendly units, he continued to attack with the burning plane and shot down another enemy plane. At this time, his own plane also lost control, and he himself lost the opportunity to parachute, crashing and exploding. My closest comrade-in-arms, Fan Wanzhang, who had studied flying with me and later fought together, finally heroically sacrificed himself.
    The victory of the Korean armistice is inseparable from the bloodshed and sacrifice of thousands of Volunteer Army soldiers with noble qualities like Comrade Fan Wanzhang. Whenever I think of these things, I feel a double responsibility on my shoulders—the dual responsibility entrusted to us by the people of the motherland and left behind by the sacrificed comrades. The Korean armistice is still in an unstable state. American imperialists are not reconciled to their defeat. They have tried every means to undermine and obstruct the reasonable settlement of the Korean peace and unification issue at the Geneva Conference. The puppet Syngman Rhee is still clamoring for "northward unification" every day. I am determined to work with my comrades to raise our vigilance, actively improve our tactical and technical skills, and drive the planes that the people of the motherland have entrusted to me to protect the socialist construction of the motherland and defend peace in the Far East and the world.

    保卫祖国，保卫和平
    中国人民志愿军  二级战斗英雄  杨振玉
    当朝鲜停战一周年快要来到的时候，全世界又传遍了印度支那获得停战和恢复和平的消息。和平又一次战胜了战争。协商的精神又一次战胜了美帝国主义制造战争保持紧张局势的阴谋活动，和一年以前的朝鲜一样，现在，印度支那人民在全世界爱好和平人民的支援下，终于取得了光荣的和平。
    但和平的取得又多么不容易啊！
    我禁不住想到朝鲜战场上那些战斗激烈的日子。那是一九五二年的八月，美帝国主义侵略军在朝鲜被人民军和志愿军拦击在三八线一带不能前进一步的时候，美国的空军就疯狂轰炸朝鲜的城市、乡村和所有的交通线，企图切断我军运输的道路。那时候，在清川江的上空，每天都发生着激烈的空战。我们年轻的志愿军空军受着祖国人民的委托，怀着为朝鲜人民复仇、保卫祖国人民幸福和安全的决心，勇敢坚决地打击着敌人。八月五日那一天，我们正在机场上待命作战，战斗的信号弹升起了，我紧紧跟随着长机，飞向天空。当我们发现了四架F—86敌机迎头赶上去时，狡猾的敌人见了我们却闪了想跑。我们紧紧保持着编队，又紧紧追上去。那时我心中只有一个念头“不能让敌人逃跑”。敌人毕竟出现在我的光圈中了，我开炮发射，眼看着它掉下地去，我的长机也击伤了一架敌机。第三天，战斗又开始了。击落敌机三架、击伤一架的特等功臣范万章遇上四架敌机缠住他格斗。他打掉了一架，敌人继续向他攻击，他的机身中弹起火，但他因为继续要掩护友邻部队，带着着了火的飞机继续攻击，又打掉了一架敌机。这时他自己的飞机也失去操纵性能，他自己也失掉了跳伞的机会，落地爆炸了。和我一起学习飞行，以后又在一起战斗的我的最亲密的战友范万章同志终于英勇牺牲了。
    朝鲜停战的胜利和千万个像范万章同志那样品质高贵的志愿军战士的流血牺牲是分不开的。每当我想起这些，我觉得自己肩头压了双倍的责任——祖国人民委托给我们的和已经牺牲的同志遗留下来的双重责任。朝鲜停战现在还处在不稳定的状态，美帝国主义者并不甘心它的失败，他们千方百计破坏和阻挠了日内瓦会议关于朝鲜和平、统一问题的合理解决，傀儡李承晚还在天天叫嚣“北进统一”。我决心和我的战友一起提高警惕，积极提高战术和技术素养，很好地驾驶祖国人民交给我的飞机，保卫祖国的社会主义建设，保卫远东和世界和平。
