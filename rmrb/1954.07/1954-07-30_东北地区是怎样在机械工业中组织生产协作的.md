How the Northeast Region Organizes Production Collaboration in the Machinery Industry
Industrial Division of the Northeast Financial and Economic Committee

I. The Process of Organizing Production Collaboration

Organizing the dispersed and unbalanced mechanical industrial production capacity of different leadership systems, different economic components, and different regions to provide sufficient technical equipment for various sectors of the national economy through collaboration is an important measure for the machinery industry during the transition period to realize the country's socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of agriculture and handicrafts. The Northeast machinery industry has done some work in this area over the past year or so, but the planned organization of production collaboration is still in its initial stages.

Before the beginning of 1953, we lacked sufficient understanding of collaborative production in the machinery industry and only regarded it as a temporary task. At the beginning of 1953, the state urgently needed "051" products, not only in large quantities but also with extremely tight deadlines. This task was assigned by the First Ministry of Machine Building of the Central People's Government to the specialized factories in Shenyang under the ministry according to departmental collaboration. The insertion of the "051" task disrupted the original processes of these specialized factories, seriously affecting the normal execution of the state plan. Furthermore, due to unfamiliarity with the "051" operating methods, they simply intensified labor to rush production, resulting in a series of problems, causing chaos, and making it impossible to complete the task. In this emergency, we felt that the structure of "051" was not complicated, and local state-owned factories and private factories could manufacture it, and local state-owned factories also had surplus capacity. Therefore, we organized 58 state-owned, local state-owned, and private factories, as well as some handicraftsmen, to carry out large-scale production collaboration. As a result, the production order of the state-owned specialized factories was not disrupted, the existing capacity of local state-owned and private enterprises was fully utilized, many advanced operating methods emerged, the state's investment burden for adding equipment was reduced, and the task was completed on schedule. These benefits made us realize that the capacity of the machinery industry is great, and as long as production collaboration is properly organized, it can both meet the needs and improve the technical level of machinery industrial production, which is beneficial in every way.

Since then, we have begun to consciously grasp collaborative production, but we still narrowly regard it as a method and means to solve temporary difficulties, without considering its significance and role in the long term and comprehensively. At that time, as long as there were problems, some construction units and industrial and mining enterprises came to us one after another, requesting to organize collaboration, and we accepted all requests and investigated and worked for them one by one. In this way, although many specific problems were solved, we were busy and chaotic, and the collaborative affairs became deeper and deeper. We began to feel urgently that it was necessary to concentrate the scattered and chaotic collaborative businesses and improve them further. We started to study the work of organizing collaboration, investigated the external collaboration rules of several typical factories and mines, and organized manpower to conduct a general survey of the equipment capacity and technical capacity of electromechanical factories in the entire region. In December 1953, starting from checking the production preparation work for the first quarter of 1954, focusing on Shenyang and Dalian, the concentrated areas of the Northeast machinery industry, we convened the Northeast Regional Major Machinery Factory Production Collaboration Conference. We organized 192 production collaboration tasks to ensure that all units complete the needs of the national plan for the first quarter of this year. The conference also summarized the gains and shortcomings of the Northeast's collaboration work in the past year, and believed that in the future, under the unified leadership of the central government, according to the key problems existing in the Northeast machinery industry, we must especially focus on the collaborative production of large, specialized, and precision equipment, as well as the main equipment and complete sets of equipment urgently needed for national construction; we must strengthen leadership and strengthen planning. Through the collaboration conference, the understanding and connection between production and demand were also strengthened, and since then, the collaboration work in the entire region has become significantly more active.

Beginning in 1954, we consciously handed over general temporary collaborations to relevant departments or regions (provincial and municipal finance committees) according to the principles of collaboration, and directed the focus of organizing collaboration to two main aspects: First, to assist key projects in solving the domestic equipment collaboration production problems. In essence, it is the new product collaboration problem of the machinery industry, especially the mechanical and electrical cooperation problem in the machinery industry. The second is to assist existing enterprises in solving the key equipment and spare parts collaboration problems. These two tasks are more arduous and complex, and require multi-faceted cooperation and investigation to solve. In assisting existing enterprises in solving key equipment and spare parts, such as special ring gears, especially herringbone gear collaborative production problems, because the manufacturing precision of ring gears is relatively high, the equipment for producing special ring gears is extremely lacking, and the collaboration surface is wide, therefore, the needing factories and mines ran around all year round and have not been resolved. Even one ring gear damaged and not repaired affected the production of the entire factory, or even an entire region. To this end, at the beginning of 1954, after more than two months of investigation, we held a four-day professional meeting to study and solve the problem. From the rational cooperation and division of labor of machine tools, to the allocation of technicians and the supply of tools, we organized cooperation and collaboration in all aspects, so that the long-unresolved special ring gear problem was initially solved more comprehensively. Similar to these major issues that are closely related to the improvement of the production capacity of existing enterprises, and the collaboration relationship is more complex, is what needs to be paid attention to in organizing production collaboration in the future.

In assisting key projects in organizing collaboration, because new enterprises, especially the 141 key projects designed by the Soviet Union to help our country, will continue to be put into production in 1954, the domestic self-made equipment production problems are increasingly numerous. These equipments generally have the characteristics of many varieties, small quantities, urgent deadlines, and high technical requirements, which must be solved through the cooperation and collaboration of the machinery industry. Therefore, in March, we held a Northeast Machinery Industry Guarantee Key Project Collaboration Conference, agreed on 496 items, more than 42,000 pieces, and checked and assisted in solving the difficult problems in the existing collaboration tasks.

The development of production collaboration in the Northeast machinery industry has gradually become principled, planned, and led after going through a blind and chaotic exploration stage.

II. Ideological Problems Encountered in Organizing Production Collaboration

In organizing production collaboration in the machinery industry, there have been many ideological problems in the past and present. In the beginning, the vision was narrow, emphasizing specialization, emphasizing "closed-doorism," and unwilling to cooperate with factories outside the department, and basically not welcoming collaborative tasks. For example, when organizing the "051" product collaboration, the Northeast Office of the First Ministry of Machine Building believed that it was troublesome to collaborate with local state-owned factories, the financial procedures were complicated, and technical acceptance increased disputes, so it only wanted to organize collaboration in the ministry's factories, saying: "Brother factories are easy to talk about," and did not consider the utilization and utilization of local state-owned factories' existing capacity. Some factories wanted to develop their factory into a "051" product professional manufacturing factory, hoping to increase investment and expand the scale, and manufacture everything by themselves, and were unwilling to organize local capacity to assist in production. For another example, the Second Machine Industry Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building, although the Shenyang First Machine Tool Factory under the bureau was willing to hand over a certain type of bed collaboration problem to a certain factory in Shenyang City for casting, and a certain factory in Shenyang City also actively prepared for production, the bureau dismantled the collaboration between the First Machine Tool Factory and a certain factory in Shenyang City and allocated it to the First Machine Tool Factory in Qiqihar, which is far away from the bureau. As a result, the bed, which weighed five tons, traveled back and forth 1,500 kilometers, causing unnecessary losses to the country. When organizing collaboration, some factories were unwilling to supply collaborative products as a complete set, only considering the convenience of their own factory; some factories were unwilling to accept "extra" collaborative tasks in order to maintain "rhythm production"; and individual factories even adopted a simple "agree to stay, disagree to leave" pure trading style for collaborative tasks.

After the factories began to overcome the isolationist ideology in collaboration, the bigger deviation that still exists is that they only care about developing the potential of their own factory and "increasing income," and do not make serious guarantees for collaborative tasks. For example, accepting collaborative tasks is only for filling in the blanks, thinking that it is not a planned task, and it can be completed or not; they are picky about collaborative tasks in every way, and do not decide to undertake them based on whether the nature is important, but put aside important collaborative orders and look for a large number of "odd jobs" that are beneficial to increasing the output value; some are afraid to undertake collaborative tasks for key projects, thinking that the responsibility is too great, "respect and stay away," and would rather take the trouble to find odd jobs.

In the machinery industry collaboration work, it should also be especially pointed out that: the needing units have a more serious dependence ideology and irresponsible ideology, providing many wrong drawings, and the collaborative tasks needed "are proposed late and wanted urgently," "are proposed a lot and there are many returns," which affects the preparation work and cannot be carried out well.

These ideological problems have caused many difficulties in the development of production collaboration. The production collaboration work in the Northeast region has developed in the process of continuous struggle against these ideological problems.

III. Several Experiences in Organizing Production Collaboration

We believe that correctly organizing production collaboration in the machinery industry has two major benefits: First, in addition to further developing potential and increasing output, the machinery industry can turn products that one factory's equipment capacity cannot produce into products that can be produced after cooperation and collaboration; one factory's technical capacity is limited, and after cooperation and collaboration, it can master new technologies, increase new varieties, and solve the difficulties of the requiring departments in a timely manner. At the same time, through correct organization and collaboration, the unbalanced development of the machinery industry can be gradually reduced, and the uneven distribution of busy and idle work in the central and remote areas can also be reduced; the level of local industry can be improved accordingly; and the policy of rational transportation can also be effectively guaranteed. Second, key projects and existing enterprises can obtain sufficient technical equipment in a timely manner through the cooperation and collaboration of the machinery industry; and private machinery industry can be effectively included in the scope of national planning through collaborative tasks, accelerating its socialist transformation.

In terms of the method of organizing production collaboration, we feel that we must first be familiar with and master the overall situation and production capacity of the machinery industry: In order to understand the basic situation of the equipment capacity and technical capacity of machinery factories, in addition to using the census data of the statistics department, we also used the opportunity of a large number of students' internships during the summer vacation to conduct a business survey of machinery factories in the entire region. We also conducted typical investigations to specifically understand the utilization of specific equipment capacity. We also combined with the usual supervision and inspection work to grasp the production capacity of specific factories. These are the minimum necessary tasks for organizing production collaboration. In addition to the basic situation, it is also necessary to understand the changes in a certain capacity during a certain period: We adopt two methods, one is to conduct investigations and understanding at any time according to needs (including going to the factory or asking the factory to report); the other is to require each machinery factory to report the surplus or insufficient capacity regularly.

To correctly organize collaboration, it is also necessary to clearly understand the ideological problems and specific difficult problems of different factories accepting collaborative tasks, and it is even more necessary to understand the situation of collaboration needs, and then organize the two parties to meet. If the simple collaborative tasks that individual factories can solve, organize the two factories to negotiate on their own. Generally, the requiring units are introduced to the production factory, and only the problem situation is reported to us so that we can provide specific assistance. The same type of collaborative tasks are solved by professional meetings after doing a good job of investigation and research; one is based on the production factory, and the requiring units are organized around the collaboration. One is based on the requiring unit, and the production factory is organized around the collaboration, such as organizing collaborative professional meetings around Angang and the First Automobile Factory.

In organizing collaboration, it is necessary to grasp the supervision and inspection, and continue to solve relevant specific problems in the collaboration process. Because collaborative tasks are generally out-of-plan tasks, there are many problems in production preparation, and they often involve several departments and factories, and the connection and coordination are more complicated. Therefore, we must recognize that the collaboration conference is only the first step in starting collaboration. If we do not seize the opportunity to assist in solving relevant specific difficulties after the meeting, one link is interrupted, and the overall collaboration will be aborted. This is one of the lessons of our many collaboration meetings in the past.

Organizing collaboration must also rely on organizations at all levels: It is necessary to maintain close contact with the central competent department, which is the guarantee for the smooth organization of collaboration. It is also necessary to cooperate closely with the representative agencies of various central ministries in the Northeast. First of all, it is necessary to do a good job of cooperation and collaboration with these departments in order to correctly organize the cooperation and collaboration between enterprise units. After organizing the collaboration, major ones should be reported to the State Planning Commission for review and approval, and listed as the national plan of each enterprise, so that the collaborative tasks can obtain legal status and ensure the final implementation of the collaborative tasks.

In organizing collaboration, it is also necessary to make full use of the binding role of the inter-enterprise contract system to ensure the implementation of collaborative tasks. No matter how urgent the task is, the signing of the contract should not be ignored.

In short, to organize production collaboration in the machinery industry, the wider the collaboration surface, the more factories participating in the collaboration, the more comprehensive the solution to the collaboration problem, and the more guaranteed the satisfaction of national needs; therefore, after obtaining the initial experience of organizing collaboration, the collaboration surface should be expanded as much as possible.

    东北地区是怎样在机械工业中组织生产协作的
    东北财政经济委员会工业处
    一、组织生产协作的经过
    将不同领导系统、不同经济成份、不同地区分散的不平衡的机械工业生产能力组织起来，以协作方式为国民经济各部门提供充足的技术装备，是机械工业在过渡时期为实现国家社会主义工业化、实现国家对农业、手工业实行社会主义改造的重要措施。东北机械工业过去一年多来在这方面曾经做了一些工作，但有计划地组织生产协作则还是开始。
    在一九五三年年初以前，我们对机械工业的协作生产缺乏足够的认识，还只把它当作一种临时任务。一九五三年年初，国家急需“○五一”产品，不仅数量庞大，并且期限极紧，这一任务由中央人民政府第一机械工业部按部门协作形式分摊该部所属沈阳各专业工厂，这些专业工厂插入“○五一”任务后，原有工序打乱，严重影响了国家计划的正常执行，并且因不熟悉“○五一”操作方法，单纯加强劳动强度突击生产，发生了一系列问题，情况混乱，任务无法完成。在这紧急情况下，我们感到“○五一”构造并不复杂，地方国营工厂、私营工厂都可以制造，而地方国营工厂也有剩余能力，因此便组织了五十八个国营、地方国营和私营的工厂以及若干手工业者进行生产大协作。结果，国营各专业工厂的生产秩序没有打乱，充分发挥了地方国营和私营企业现有能力，出现了不少先进操作方法，减轻了国家增添设备的投资负担，还如期完成了任务。这一系列的好处，使我们开始认识到，机械工业的能力是很大的，只要正确组织生产协作，既能
  满足需要，又能提高机械工业生产技术水平，它有
  百利而无一害。
    从此，我们开始有意识地掌握协作生产，但还
  只是狭隘地把它当作解决临时困难问题的方法和手
  段，没有长远、全面地考虑它的意义和作用。当时，
  若干建设单位和工矿企业，只要发生问题，就都纷
  纷找上门来，要求组织协作，我们则来者不拒，逐
  一代为调查奔走，这样，虽然解决了不少具体问
  题，但忙忙乱乱，协作事务愈陷愈深。我们开始迫
  切感到需要把零散、混乱的协作业务集中起来，提
  高一步。我们着手研究了组织协作的工作，调查了
  几个典型厂矿外部协作规律，组织人力对全区机电
  工厂设备能力和技术能力作了一番普查，一九五三
  年十二月，我们从检查一九五四年第一季生产准
  备工作出发，以东北机械工业集中地区沈阳、大连
  为重点，召开了东北全区主要机械工厂生产协作大
  会。组织了一百九十二项生产协作任务，以保证各
  单位完成今年第一季度国家计划的需要。会中并
  总结了东北一年来协作工作的收获和缺点，认为今
  后必须在中央统一领导下，根据东北机械工业存在
  的关键问题，特别抓紧大、专、精密设备的协作生
  产，以及国家建设急需的主要设备和成套设备，进
  行协作生产；必须加强领导，加强计划性。通过协
  作大会，也加强了产需之间的了解和联系，从此全
  区协作工作显著活跃起来。
      一九五四年开始，我们有意识地将一般性临时
  协作，根据协作原则交有关部门或地区（省市财委）
  处理，将组织协作的矛头，主要指向两个方面：首
  先是协助重点工程解决国内设备协作生产问题。实
  质上就是机械工业新产品协作问题，特别是机械工
  业中的机、电配合问题。其次是协助现有企业解决
  关键设备、配件协作问题。这两个工作都比较繁重
  复杂，需多方面配合、调查才能解决。在为现有企
  业解决关键设备、配件方面，如特种牙轮、特别是
  人字牙轮协作生产问题，由于牙轮制造精度较高，
  生产特种牙轮的设备又极缺乏，而牵涉协作面又广，
  因此，各需要厂矿整年奔走，一直未获解决，甚至
    一个牙轮破损未获修配，就影响全厂、甚至整整一
  个地区停止生产，为此我们在一九五四年初经过两
  个多月调查，召开四天专业会议研究解决，从机床合
  理配合分工，直至技工调配、工具供应等各方面，都
  组织了配合协作，使久悬未决的特种牙轮问题，初
  步得到较全面解决。类似这些密切关系现有企业生
  产能力的提高、而协作关系又较复杂的重大问题，
  是今后组织生产协作需要着重注意的。
      在协助重点工程组织协作方面，由于新建企业、
  特别是苏联帮助我国设计的一百四十一项重点工
    程，在一九五四年内将继续投入生产，国内自制设
  备生产问题日益繁多，这些设备一般都有品种多、
    数量少、期限急、技术要求较高的特点，都须通过
  机械工业的配合协作才能解决。因此，三月间我们
    召开了一次东北机械工业保证重点工程协作会议，
  协议四百九十六项、四万二千余件，并检查和协助
  解决了已有协作任务中的困难问题。
      东北机械工业生产协作的发展，就是这样经过
    盲目、忙乱的摸索阶段以后，才逐渐趋于有原则、
    有计划、有领导地开展起来的。
      二、在组织生产协作中遇到的
          思想问题
      在组织机械工业生产协作中，过去和现在都存
    在不少思想问题。开始是视线较窄，强调专业化，
    强调“闭关自守”，不愿意与部门外的工厂配合，
  对协作任务基本上不表欢迎。如开始组织“○五一”产品协作时，第一机械工业部东北办事处认为与地方国营工厂进行协作，材料成品运输麻烦，财务手续辗转复杂，技术验收增加纠纷，因此只愿在本部各厂组织协作，所谓：“兄弟工厂什么都好说”，对于利用和发挥地方国营工厂现有能力考虑不够。有的工厂则想发展本厂为“○五一”产品专业制造厂，希望增加投资、扩大规模，什么都由自己制造，不愿组织地方能力协助生产。又如第一机械工业部第二机器工业局，对该局沈阳第一机床厂某类床身协作问题，虽然第一机床厂愿意交由沈阳市某厂铸造，沈阳市某厂也积极做了生产准备，但该局竟拆散第一机床厂与沈阳市某厂的协作，拨交该局远在齐齐哈尔的第一机床厂铸造，结果重达五吨的床身往返一千五百公里，造成国家不必要的损失。有的厂在组织协作时，不愿协作产品的成套性供应，只顾本厂方便；有的厂为了维持“节奏生产”，不愿接受“额外”的协作任务，有个别工厂对协作任务甚至采取简单的“合则留、不合则散”的单纯买卖作风。
      在各厂开始克服协作中的孤立主义思想后，还存在着的较大的偏向是只顾本厂发挥潜力、“增加收入”，对协作任务不作严肃保证。如接受协作任务只作补空之用，认为不是计划任务，可完成可不完成；对协作任务多方挑剔，不以性质是否重要决定承接，而是搁下重要协作订货，四出寻找大量的有利于增加产值的“杂活”；也有不敢承接重点工程协作任务，认为责任太大，“敬而远之”，宁愿多麻烦去另找杂活。
      在机械工业协作工作中，还应特别提出的是：需要单位存在较严重的依赖思想和不够负责的思想，提供图纸错误多，需要协作的任务“提得迟、要得急”，“提得多、退货也多”，影响生产准备工作不能很好进行。
      以上这些思想问题，曾给生产协作的开展造成了许多困难。东北地区生产协作工作，是在与这些思想问题进行不断的斗争过程中开展起来的。
  三、组织生产协作的几点体会
    正确组织机械工业生产协作，我们认为有两大好处：第一，机械工业通过生产协作，除能进一步发挥潜力、提高产量外，由于一个工厂设备能力不能生产的产品，配合协作后可以转为能够生产；一个工厂技术能力有限，配合协作后就能掌握新技术、增加新品种，并能及时解决需用部门的困难问题。同时通过正确的组织协作，机械工业发展不平衡的状况可以逐渐减少，中心地区和边远地区的忙闲不均现象也可以减少；地方工业水平可以相应提高；合理运输的方针也能得到有力保证。第二，重点工程和现有企业通过机械工业配合协作，可以及时获得充足的技术装备；私营机械工业通过协作任务，可以有效纳入国家计划范围，加速其社会主义改造。
      在组织生产协作的方法方面，我们感到首先要熟悉和掌握机械工业的全面情况和生产能力：为了了解机械工厂设备能力和技术能力的基本情况，我们除利用统计部门的普查资料外，曾利用暑期大批学生实习的机会，对全区机械工厂作过一次业务性的调查。也进行典型调查，专门了解具体设备能力运用情况。还结合平时督促检查工作，掌握具体工厂生产能力。这些都是组织生产协作起码的必需的工作。除基本情况外，还需了解某一时期某种能力变动情况：我们采取两种方式，一是根据需要随时进行调查、了解（包括下厂或请工厂汇报）；一是要求各机械工厂定期报告能力剩余或不足的情况。
      正确组织协作，还要清楚了解不同工厂接受协作任务的思想问题和具体困难问题，更要了解需要协作的情况，然后组织两者见面，如个别工厂能解决的简单协作任务，组织两厂自行洽商，一般是介绍需要单位至生产厂，只将问题情况汇报我们，以便具体协助。同类型协作任务，做好调查研究后以专业会议解决；一种是以生产厂为主，需要单位围绕组织协作。一种是以需要单位为主，生产厂围绕协作，如围绕鞍钢、第一汽车厂组织协作专业会议。
    在组织协作中要抓紧督促检查，继续在协作过程中解决有关具体问题。由于协作任务一般都是计划外任务，生产准备的问题较多，又往往牵涉几个部门、工厂，联系配合比较复杂，因此必须认识协作会议只是开始协作的第一步，不在会后抓紧协助解决有关具体困难，一个环节中断，全面协作就会流产。这是我们过去很多协作会议的教训之一。
    组织协作还必须依靠各级组织：必须与中央主管部局密切联系，这是顺利组织协作的保证。还必须与中央各部在东北的代表机关密切配合，首先做好与这些部门的配合协作，才能正确组织企业单位之间的配合协作。组织协作后，重大的要报请国家计划委员会审查批准，列为各该企业的国家计划，使协作任务取得合法地位，保证协作任务的最后贯彻。
    在组织协作中还要充分利用企业间合同制的约束作用，以保证协作任务的贯彻，任何紧急任务都不应忽略合同的签订。
    总之，组织机械工业生产协作，协作的面愈广，参加协作的厂愈多，解决协作问题也就愈全面，满足国家需要也愈有保证；因此，在取得组织协作的初步经验后，协作面应尽量扩大。
