    The Will of the German People for Peaceful Reunification
    Xi Linsheng
    Based on the resolution of the People's Chamber, the government of the German Democratic Republic held a plebiscite throughout the republic from June 27th to 29th, allowing all the people to freely express their opinions on the following important question: "Do you support a peace treaty and the withdrawal of foreign occupation forces, or do you support the 'European Defense Community' treaty and the 'General Treaty,' and the continued stationing of occupation forces for fifty years?" At almost the same time, patriotic progressives in various parts of West Germany also organized similar plebiscites. The results of the voting showed that in the German Democratic Republic, more than 13,399,000 people participated, of whom more than 12,231,000 (over 90% of the voters) expressed their desire for a peace treaty and their opposition to the Bonn Treaty and the Paris Treaty; in West Germany, 90% to 95% of the participants expressed the same will. The results of this plebiscite collectively reflect the German people's national aspirations for peace, democracy, and unification.

    The common will expressed by the people of East and West Germany undoubtedly has extremely important significance for the continued struggle for a peaceful resolution of the German question. Although the Berlin Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference failed to reach an agreement on the peaceful resolution of the German question due to obstruction by the United States and its partners, the German question has not been removed from the agenda. However, the enemies of peace and German unity are trying to convince people that the Berlin Conference has made the task of unifying Germany "unnecessary" and are portraying the Bonn and Paris Treaties, which they are trying to impose on the people of West Germany and other Western European countries, as being supported by the majority of the people of West Germany. They are attempting to use this to negate the task of concluding a peace treaty with Germany and unifying Germany, as well as the German people's will for peaceful reunification, in order to intensify the implementation of their plans to push Germany towards war and destruction. However, the plans of the enemies of peace and German unity have been countered by the German people, the people of other Western European countries, and peace-loving people all over the world. The struggle for peace, democracy, and the unification of Germany is continuing to surge forward after the Berlin Conference. The plebiscites held in East and West Germany and their results vividly demonstrate this.

    The German people are well aware that the responsibility for Germany's failure to restore peace and unification lies entirely with the United States and its running dog, the Adenauer clique, in West Germany. The Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic have tirelessly striven to seek a peaceful resolution of the German question, but the United States has tried every possible means to delay and obstruct it, unreasonably rejecting all the proposals put forward by the Soviet Union at the Berlin Conference, and stubbornly insisting on its notorious "European Defense Community," attempting to impose the Paris Treaty and the Bonn Treaty on Germany and other Western European countries. The United States and its partners even rejected the suggestion that East and West Germany establish two all-German committees to promote and expand economic and cultural relations between East and West Germany. This undeniably demonstrates that the United States' sole aim is to obstruct the restoration of German unification.

    The aim of the United States towards Germany is very clear, namely, to turn Germany into a tool for launching new wars. The US policy towards Germany is to keep Germany permanently divided and to remilitarize West Germany. It is precisely because of this that the United States clings to the Bonn Treaty and the Paris Treaty. It is well known that these two treaties are treaties that hinder the restoration of German unification and further colonize West Germany and revive West German militarism. The Bonn Treaty stipulates that the Western countries will continue to occupy West Germany for fifty years, and obliges the Bonn government not to agree to any plan to restore German unification. The Paris Treaty is to rebuild Hitler's Wehrmacht for the war purposes of the United States, and to hand over the armies of France and other countries participating in the treaty to West German militarism. It is obvious that these two war treaties will deprive West Germany of its sovereignty and the hope of restoring German unification, and drive West Germany onto the path of war. The United States is trying to convince people that the Bonn and Paris Treaties are not contradictory to the restoration of German unification, a lie that obviously cannot deceive anyone. The establishment of the "European Defense Community" will not only deepen the division of Germany, but also create opposition between European countries. Historical experience has repeatedly proved that the establishment of hostile military blocs in Europe will inevitably lead to war. Therefore, this sinister policy of the United States is increasingly seriously threatening the peace and security of Germany and all of Europe.

    After the end of the Berlin Conference, the United States intensified its plan to establish the "European Defense Community." The United States has instructed the Adenauer clique to force the Bonn Federal Parliament to pass the constitutional amendment bill for universal conscription and formally approve the Bonn Treaty and the Paris Treaty. At the same time, the United States has been constantly putting pressure on countries such as France and Italy, attempting to force them to quickly ratify the "European Army" treaty. To this end, the United States, together with the United Kingdom, has played the deceptive trick of providing "guarantees" to France, and announced that it would cancel "aid" to those countries that have not ratified the "European Defense Community" treaty to threaten them. The statement issued by the heads of government of the United States and the United Kingdom after their meeting in Washington recently openly warned France not to delay the ratification of the "European Defense Community" treaty and not to allow "new complications." The US Ambassador to France, Dillon, even blatantly threatened France that it must choose between establishing the "European Defense Community" and re-establishing a so-called independent German army. In order to accelerate the plan to establish the "European Army," the US and British governments have established a special committee to "study" the issue of granting "sovereignty" to West Germany. The United Press International revealed that this plan to grant "sovereignty" to West Germany is "the first step towards making the German army participate in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization." This reckless and arrogant approach of the United States fully exposes how eagerly the United States and its partners want to rebuild an aggressive army in the heart of Europe to prepare for launching new wars.

    This is obviously intolerable to the German people and the people of other European countries. The programmatic document "The Road to Solving the Vital Problems of the German Nation" adopted by the Fourth Congress of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany declared: "The Bonn and Paris Treaties hinder the unification of Germany and pave the way for war. ... If Germany is to live in peace, then the Paris Treaty on the 'European Defense Community' and the Bonn 'General Treaty' must be abandoned, and the remilitarization of West Germany must be stopped." The Second National Congress of the National Front of Democratic Germany, in its letter to all the German people, called on all the German people to establish a broad united front to fight against the European Defense Community policy and against militarization. The goal of the German people's struggle is to achieve the conclusion of a peace treaty and the restoration of national unity through consultation. This reasonable desire of the German people has won the sympathy and support of all peace-loving forces in Europe and the world. The International Conference of Opponents of the "European Defense Community" held in Paris from March 20th to 21st this year, and the International Conference on Easing Tensions held in Stockholm from June 19th to 23rd this year, both passed resolutions demanding the speedy resumption of negotiations on the German question in order to seek a peaceful restoration of German unification. This demand of the German people and all peace-loving forces in the world cannot be ignored; the movement to strive for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and the restoration of German unification cannot be stopped by any force.

    The fate of Germany should be solved by the Germans. The plebiscites held in East and West Germany and their results once again showed that all the German people are absolutely unwilling to allow the country to continue to be divided and move towards war and destruction. The national will expressed by the German people, and their common struggle with the people of other Western European countries, especially the people of France and Italy, are a major force in thwarting the plans of the United States and its lackeys to turn West Germany into a source of new wars. The unity and unremitting struggle of the German people and the people of Western European countries will enable the task of restoring German unification and consolidating European peace to be realized.

    德国人民要求和平统一的意志
    席林生
    德意志民主共和国政府根据人民议院的决议，从六月二十七日至二十九日在共和国全境举行了人民投票，由全体人民就下面这样一个重要问题自由表示意见，就是“你赞成和约和撤退外国占领军呢？还是赞成‘欧洲防务集团’条约和‘一般性条约’以及让占领军继续留驻五十年呢？”差不多同时，在西德的各个地方也由爱国的进步人士组织举行了同样性质的人民投票。投票结果，在民主德国，参加投票的共有一千三百三十九万九千多人，其中有一千二百二十三万一千多人（占投票人数百分之九十以上）表示他们要求缔结和约、反对波恩条约和巴黎条约；在西德参加投票的人，也有百分之九十到九十五的人表示了同样的意志。这次人民投票的结果，集中地反映了德国人民要求和平、民主、统一的民族愿望。
    东西德人民所表示的共同意志对于继续争取和平解决德国问题的斗争，无疑有着极其重要的意义。柏林四国外长会议由于美国及其伙伴们的阻挠对和平解决德国问题没有达成协议，但是德国问题并没有从议事日程上除掉。然而，和平与德国统一的敌人却力图使人们相信，柏林会议已使统一德国的任务成为“不必要”，并且把他们企图强加在西德和西欧其他国家人民头上的波恩和巴黎条约说成是西德大多数人民所赞成的。他们企图借此来抹煞缔结对德和约与统一德国的任务，以及德国人民的要求和平统一的意志，以便加紧推行他们的把德国推向战争与毁灭的计划。但是，和平与德国统一的敌人的计划，遭到德国人民、西欧其他国家人民和全世界爱好和平人民的反击，争取和平民主和统一德国的斗争，在柏林会议后正在继续高涨。东西德所举行的人民投票及其结果，就生动地证明了这一点。
    德国人民都清楚地知道，德国所以至今未能恢复和平与统一，责任完全在于美国及其在西德的走狗阿登纳集团。苏联和德意志民主共和国曾不倦地为谋求德国问题的和平解决而努力，但是美国却千方百计地加以拖延和阻挠，毫无道理地拒绝了苏联在柏林会议上提出的一切建议，而死命坚持其声名狼藉的“欧洲防务集团”，要把巴黎条约和波恩条约强加在德国和其他西欧国家的头上。美国及其伙伴甚至拒绝了这样的建议，即：由东西德成立两个全德委员会以促进和扩展东西德的经济和文化关系。这就无可争辩地表明了美国一心想要达到的目的就是要阻挠德国恢复统一。
    美国对德国所怀抱的目的是十分明显的，那就是要把德国变为它发动新战争的工具。美国的对德政策，就是要使德国永远陷于分裂，并使西德重新军国主义化。正是因为这样，所以美国死抱住波恩条约和巴黎条约不放。人所共知，这两个条约是阻碍德国恢复统一和使西德进一步殖民地化、复活西德军国主义的条约。波恩条约规定了西方国家要继续占领西德五十年，并使波恩政府承担了不得同意任何恢复德国统一的计划的义务。而巴黎条约则是为了美国的战争目的而重新建立希特勒的国防军，并把法国和其他参加条约的国家的军队交到西德军国主义手里。显而易见，这两个战争条约将剥夺西德的主权和恢复德国统一的希望，并驱使西德走上战争的道路。美国力图使人相信波恩与巴黎条约和德国的恢复统一并不矛盾，这种谎言显然是骗不了人的。“欧洲防务集团”的建立，不仅将加深德国的分裂，并且将造成欧洲国家之间的对立。历史的经验早已一再证明，在欧洲建立敌对的军事集团不可避免地要走向战争。因此，美国的这种罪恶政策正日益严重地威胁着德国以及全欧洲的和平与安全。
    在柏林会议结束之后，美国即加紧推行其建立“欧洲防务集团”的计划。美国已指使阿登纳集团强令波恩联邦议院通过了普遍征兵的宪法修改法案，并正式批准了波恩条约和巴黎条约。与此同时，美国不断向法、意等国施加压力，企图迫使它们迅速批准“欧洲军”条约。为此，美国与英国一道向法国玩弄了提供“保证”的骗人把戏，并宣布要取消对那些没有批准“欧洲防务集团”条约国家的
  “援助”，来进行威胁。最近美英两国政府首脑在华盛顿举行会谈后发表的声明，更公然警告法国不得拖延批准“欧洲防务集团”条约，并不准“另生枝节”。美国驻法大使狄龙甚至明目张胆地要挟法国必须在建立“欧洲防务集团”及重新建立一支所谓独立的德国军队之间加以选择。为了加速建立“欧洲军”的计划，美英政府并成立了一个特别委员会，进行“研究”给予西德“主权”的问题。美国合众社透露说，这个给予西德“主权”的计划，是“使德国军队参加北大西洋公约组织的第一项步骤”。美国这种不顾一切的狂妄做法，充分暴露了美国及其伙伴们是如何急切地要在欧洲的心脏地带重建起一支侵略军队，来为发动新的战争作准备。
    这显然是德国人民和欧洲其他国家人民所不能容忍的。德国统一社会党第四次代表大会通过的纲领性的文件“解决德意志民族的切身问题的道路”中宣布：“波恩与巴黎条约阻碍着德国的统一并为战争开辟道路。……如果德国要和平地生活下去，那末，必须抛弃关于‘欧洲防务集团’的巴黎条约和波恩‘一般性条约’，而且必须制止西德重新军国主义化。”民主德国全国阵线第二次全国代表大会在告全体德国人民书中号召全体德国人民建立广泛的统一战线，为反对欧洲防务集团政策、反对军国主义化而斗争。德国人民斗争的目标，就是要通过协商的方法来实现缔结和约和恢复国家的统一。德国人民的这个合理愿望，得到了欧洲各国及全世界一切爱好和平力量的同情和支持。今年三月二十日至二十一日在巴黎召开的“欧洲防务集团”反对者国际会议，及今年六月十九日至二十三日在斯德哥尔摩举行的缓和局势国际会议，都曾通过决议，要求尽速恢复关于德国问题的谈判，以谋求和平恢复德国的统一。德国人民和全世界一切爱好和平力量的这种要求是不容忽视的；争取缔结对德和约和恢复德国统一的运动是任何力量所阻挡不住的。
    德国的命运应当由德国人来解决。东西德所举行的人民投票及其结果，再一次显示了全体德国人民绝不愿意使国家继续陷于分裂，并走向战争和毁灭的道路。德国人民所表示的民族意志，和他们与西欧其他各国人民特别是法、意两国人民所进行的共同斗争，是挫败美国及其仆从变西德为新战争策源地的计划的重大力量。德国人民及西欧各国人民的团结一致和不懈斗争，将使恢复德国的统一与巩固欧洲和平的任务得到实现。
