    The people of Xi'an from all walks of life, rejoicing over the realization of peace in Indochina, held a grand celebration meeting of more than a thousand people on the 25th. Yang Mingxuan, Chairman of the Northwest General Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, spoke first amid warm applause. He said: The restoration of peace in Indochina is a major victory for the principles of peaceful consultation and peaceful coexistence, and another failure for the policy of strength of American imperialism; but we must not forget that the American warmongering clique will not be reconciled by this failure, and we should especially note that our country's territory of Taiwan is still forcibly occupied by American imperialism and the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and the people of Taiwan are still suffering deeply. This is something we cannot tolerate. Yang Mingxuan emphasized: Our current task is to ensure the implementation of the Geneva Conference agreements, prevent American conspiracies and sabotage; further consolidate peace in Indochina; continue to strive for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue; and at the same time, we must resolutely complete the sacred task of liberating Taiwan.
    Zhang Zhizhong, Director of the Northwest Work Guidance Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, then spoke, praising the achievements of the Geneva Conference and expressing great excitement about the unprecedented improvement of our country's international status.
    Also speaking at the meeting were Cheng Boren, Deputy Director of the Northwest General Branch of the China Democratic League, Zhao Zhankui, Deputy Director of the Northwest Working Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Han Xiacun, Standing Committee Member of the Northwest Democratic Youth Federation, Li Chunlin, Deputy Director of the Northwest Region Working Committee of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, and Ma Pingfu, Deputy Director of the Ethnic Affairs Committee of the Xi'an Municipal People's Government, and five others. They stated: Workers, youth, and women of all ethnic groups in the Northwest are working diligently for a bright socialist future, and at the same time, they have never forgotten the compatriots in Taiwan who are suffering. We are always ready to contribute everything we have to our beloved motherland, and to work hard for the liberation of Taiwan and for lasting world peace. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    西安市各界人民举行庆祝大会
    为印度支那实现和平而欢欣鼓舞的西安各界人民，二十五日举行了一千多人的盛大庆祝会。中国人民保卫世界和平委员会西北总分会主席杨明轩在热烈的掌声中首先讲话，他说：印度支那和平的恢复是和平协商与和平共处原则的重大胜利，也是美帝国主义实力政策的又一次失败；但我们不能忘记，美国好战集团是不会因这次失败而甘休的，特别应该注意的是我们祖国的领土台湾还被美帝国主义和蒋介石残余匪帮强占，台湾同胞还在遭受着深重的苦难，这是我们所不能容忍的。杨明轩着重指出：我们当前的任务就是保证日内瓦会议协议的实施，防止美国的阴谋破坏；进一步巩固印度支那的和平；继续争取朝鲜问题的和平解决；同时必须坚决完成解放台湾这一神圣任务。
    中国国民党革命委员会西北工作指导委员会主任委员张治中继起发言，他赞扬日内瓦会议的成就，并对我国国际地位的空前提高表示十分兴奋。
    在大会上讲话的还有中国民主同盟西北总支部委员会副主任委员成柏仁、中华全国总工会西北工作委员会副主任赵占魁、西北民主青年联合会常务委员会委员韩夏存、中华全国民主妇女联合会西北区工作委员会副主任李春霖、西安市人民政府民族事务委员会副主任委员马平甫等九人。他们表示：西北各族工人、青年、妇女正为着美好的社会主义前途而进行着勤奋的劳动，同时，也从没有忘记过苦难中的台湾同胞。我们时刻准备着为可爱的祖国贡献出自己的一切，为解放台湾，为世界的持久和平而努力。（据新华社讯）
