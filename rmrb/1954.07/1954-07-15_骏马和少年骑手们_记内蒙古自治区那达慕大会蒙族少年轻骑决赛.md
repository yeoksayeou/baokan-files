	Steeds and Young Riders
	——A Record of the Mongolian Youth Equestrian Final at the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Nadam Fair
	Xinhua News Agency Reporter Dan Wu'ertu
	On July 4th, on the small training ground to the right of the Ulanqab Theater (Red Theater) in Hohhot, more than 30,000 people gathered in layers around the 1,500-meter race track. They were all intently waiting for an exciting and moving competition at the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Nadam Fair - the 1,500-meter light cavalry final for Mongolian youth riders.
	Light cavalry circle racing is unprecedented in Inner Mongolia's national sports. It is not easy to train wild horses that have always been allowed to roam freely on the vast grasslands to be tame in a short period of time. People were eager to see how the young riders would demonstrate higher riding skills and courage to control the wild horses that were raising their heads, pricking up their ears, and charging wildly.
	The finalists were Guanbula Budun and E Renqin Handa from Hulunbuir League, and Lige Jinzhabu and Serin Baoren from Chahar League. The oldest was fifteen years old, and the youngest was twelve years old. The young riders and their steeds were dressed as if they were guests attending a wedding, very dazzling. Before entering the arena, they straightened their red and green silk headscarves, tightened their belts and the saddle girths of their steeds, then took up the reins, stepped into the stirrups, and nimbly leaped onto the backs of their steeds, entering the arena to the sound of the "Cavalry March." They circled the track once, drawing the audience's attention to the starting point of the track.
	The red flag waved, and the starting gun fired. The two steeds of Lige Jinzhabu and Guanbula Budun in the first group of the light cavalry final couldn't wait to kick off their hooves, and a cloud of dust flew up. The riders, lying on the backs of their horses, waved their whips, and the steeds stretched their hooves straight and galloped with their bellies close to the ground. The light chestnut horse and the red horse were always closely linked. In the blink of an eye, three hundred, five hundred, and eight hundred meters were passed. Seeing that they were about to reach the finish line, thirteen-year-old Guanbula Budun nervously whipped his light chestnut horse several times in a row, leaping over the red horse and flying past. As a result, he took the lead in crossing the finish line with a time of two minutes and four and seven seconds, while Lige Jinzhabu's red horse achieved a time of two minutes and five seconds.
	The second group, Serin Baoren and E Renqin Handa, started the competition amidst warm applause from the audience. Their riding skills, riding posture, and the tense scenes of mutual overtaking and close pursuit also won continuous cheers from the audience. Serin Baoren's steed won the third place award in the final with a time of two minutes and eighteen and seven seconds.
	These young riders are all primary school students from the grasslands. After they left the arena, they excitedly expressed that they would work hard to exercise their bodies in the future and dedicate themselves to the sacred cause of defending the motherland.

    骏马和少年骑手们
    ——记内蒙古自治区那达慕大会蒙族少年轻骑决赛
    新华社记者　丹·武尔图
    七月四日，在呼和浩特市乌兰恰特（红色剧院）右侧的小教场上，沿着周圆一千五百公尺长的赛马跑道周围，层层密聚了三万多人。他们全神贯注地等待着内蒙古自治区那达慕大会上一项精彩动人的竞赛——蒙族少年轻骑手们一千五百公尺轻骑决赛。
    轻骑圈线赛，在内蒙古民族形式体育运动中，还是从来没有过的。一直撒野纵放在广阔草原上的烈马，要在短期内训练得很驯服，是不容易的。人们多么渴望快点看到少年骑手们怎样发挥更高的骑术和勇敢，来操纵那仰头竖耳、横冲直闯着的烈马。
    这次参加决赛的，有呼伦贝尔盟的官布拉布敦、鄂仁沁汉达和察哈尔盟的力格金扎布、色仁宝仁四个人，年龄最大的十五岁，最小的十二岁。少年骑手们和他们的骏马都打扮得好像要去参加婚礼的宾客一般，十分耀眼。入场以前，他们端正自己的红绿彩绸头巾，束紧了腰带和骏马的鞍带，然后勒起辔绳，脚一跨镫，敏捷地，飞上了骏马的鞍背，在“骑兵进行曲”奏乐声中跑进了会场。他们环行跑道一周，把观众的视线一齐引向跑道的起点。
    红旗一摆，信号枪响了。轻骑决赛第一组的力格金扎布、官布拉布敦的两匹骏马，迫不及待地蹬开了四蹄，一股灰尘飞扬起来。伏在马背上的骑手挥舞着鞭儿，骏马四蹄伸直、肚皮贴近地面飞奔着。那匹浅栗色的马和红马一直是首尾相连。瞬眼间，三百、五百、八百公尺的穿过去，眼看快到终点，十三岁的官布拉布敦紧张地把自己浅栗马连抽了几鞭，跃过红色骏马飞越而去。结果，他以二分四秒七领先跑进了终点红线，力格金扎布的红色骏马获得二分五秒的成绩。
    第二组色仁宝仁、鄂仁沁汉达，在观众的热烈掌声中，开始竞赛了。他们的骑术、骑姿和相互超越、跟踪追赶的紧张情景，也接连得到观众的喝采。色仁宝仁的骏马，以二分十八秒七获得了决赛第三名的奖赏。
    这些少年骑手们，都是草原上小学的小学生。他们走出会场后，兴奋地表示：以后还要努力锻炼身体，将来好献身于保卫祖国的神圣事业。
