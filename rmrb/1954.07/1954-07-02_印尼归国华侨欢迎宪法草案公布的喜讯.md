    Overseas Chinese Returning from Indonesia Welcome the Good News of the Promulgation of the Draft Constitution
    The Shenzhen Railway Station was particularly lively on the 28th. More than 900 overseas Chinese returning from Indonesia threw themselves into the embrace of the motherland. As soon as they got off the train, the reception staff of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the Guangdong Provincial People's Government told them the news of the nationwide rejoicing over the promulgation of the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China. As the loudspeaker broadcast the content of the draft constitution, many returned overseas Chinese carefully compared and read it. During their stay at the station, people could be found everywhere in the waiting room enthusiastically discussing this great happy event.
    The returned overseas Chinese Zhu Yongfu used to be a farmer who was forced to go abroad to make a living due to the poverty in China. He had not returned to China for more than 30 years. When people told him the content of the draft constitution, he said excitedly: I am almost seventy years old, and today I truly feel the joy of being a human being. In the past, the Kuomintang's laws bullied us poor people, but only today's constitution truly guarantees our rights. The motherland loves us, just like a mother.
    A returned overseas Chinese named Huang Yanjun has lived abroad for 25 years. He had returned to China twice in the past, but each time he returned overseas because he could not bear the dark rule of the Kuomintang. He said: "In the past, our family members of overseas Chinese in China did not receive any protection from the Kuomintang reactionary government, and overseas Chinese abroad were often persecuted. Only after the founding of New China did we truly receive the care and attention of the motherland. Now the state's care and protection for overseas Chinese is clearly stipulated in the draft constitution, and we are all very happy to see it."
    Many young people who have returned to China to study are even more excited when discussing the draft constitution. They unanimously thanked the motherland for its concern for young people, and were also deeply encouraged by the socialist construction of the motherland. A group of students preparing to apply for universities said: From the draft constitution, we can see the beautiful future of the motherland's socialism. After returning to China, we are determined to study hard and respond to Chairman Mao's call: be healthy, study well, and work well.

    印尼归国华侨欢迎宪法草案公布的喜讯
    二十八日的深圳车站上显得特别热闹，九百多位印尼归国华侨投进了祖国的怀抱。他们一下车，广东省人民政府华侨事务委员会的接待人员便将举国欢欣的有关中华人民共和国宪法草案公布的消息告诉他们。当扩音机播送着宪法草案的内容时，许多归侨都拿着宪法草案仔细地对照阅读。归侨们在车站上逗留时，候车室里到处都可以碰见人们热烈地谈论着这件大喜事。
    归侨朱永福过去是个农民，在国内为贫困的生活所迫到海外谋生，三十多年来一直未回国。当人们把宪法草案的内容告诉他时，他兴奋地说：我快七十岁了，今天才真正感到做人的快乐。过去，国民党的法律欺侮我们穷人，只有今天的宪法才真正保障我们的权利。祖国爱护我们，真是像母亲一样。
    一个叫黄燕均的归侨，在海外生活已经二十五年了。他过去曾两次回国，每次都因受不住国民党的黑暗统治而又回到海外去。他说：“过去我们在国内的华侨眷属得不到国民党反动政府的任何保护，在国外的华侨也常常受到迫害。只有新中国成立后，我们才真正得到了祖国的关怀和照顾。现在国家对华侨的关怀和保护又明文规定在宪法草案中，我们看见后都很高兴。”
    很多回国升学的青年，在谈论宪法草案时，更是兴奋异常。他们一致感谢祖国对青年的关心，也深深为祖国的社会主义建设所鼓舞。一群准备投考高等学校的学生说：从宪法草案中，可以看到祖国社会主义的美好将来，我们回国后决心努力学习，响应毛主席的号召：身体好、学习好、工作好。
