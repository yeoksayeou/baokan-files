Editor's Note: Today marks the tenth anniversary of Comrade Zou Taofen's death. We are publishing two commemorative articles in his memory. Comrade Zou Taofen was an outstanding cultural warrior, and the various publications he presided over had a significant impact on the masses, especially the youth. His spirit of continuous progress, his conscientious and responsible work attitude, and his excellent style of staying connected with the masses are worthy of everyone's learning.

Tao Fen and His Work
Hu Yuzhi

In July 1946, when we were commemorating Comrade Zou Taofen in Singapore, I said that Taofen was a great patriot. Today, the face of the motherland has completely changed. We are commemorating this deceased friend, who has been gone for ten years, in the capital of the people. I believe that calling him a "great patriot" is still appropriate.

A great patriot should be someone who loves the people, and the people love him; someone who serves the masses with a lifetime of tireless labor; someone who unreservedly contributes his expertise, his created career, and all the best he can offer to the people; someone who constantly defends the interests of the motherland and the people, not hesitating to risk his life and wage a firm and unyielding struggle against the enemies of the people. Comrade Taofen possessed all these excellent qualities. He fought for the establishment of the people's new publishing cause throughout his life. With unparalleled loyalty, he served the masses until his last breath, never放下his sharp weapon—the pen. He is an excellent model for cultural workers of the people.

Comrade Taofen was born in 1895. He gradually transformed from a democrat into a communist. The path Taofen took is also the path of Chinese revolutionary intellectuals. However, he entered the camp of the united front of the Chinese cultural revolution relatively late. During the first and second periods of the cultural revolution led by the Chinese Communist Party (1919 to 1927), Taofen was still a naive, simple, and enthusiastic young man. He received higher education in a church school (St. John's University) founded by imperialists. When he left school and plunged into real society, he had more contact with the national bourgeoisie. Young Zou Taofen once had the illusion of becoming an engineer, later worked as an accountant and English teacher, and finally chose journalism as his lifelong career. When "Life Weekly" was first founded, Taofen's articles mainly focused on the personal cultivation of young people. At that time, the political主張 of "Life Weekly" was only "striving for political clarity" and "revitalizing industry" ("Taofen's Literary Records," page 8), which was the political program of the weak Chinese national bourgeoisie at that time. Due to the limitations of early education and living environment, Taofen was not involved in the turbulent waves of the May Fourth Movement, the May Thirtieth Movement, and the Northern Expedition, but only occasionally impacted by the spray.

After 1927, the united front of the cultural revolution entered its third period, that is, the new revolutionary period. The Chinese big bourgeoisie, represented by the Kuomintang, turned to the counter-revolutionary camp of imperialism and feudal forces, carrying out counter-revolutionary military "encirclement and suppression" and cultural "encirclement and suppression." The national bourgeoisie also echoed the big bourgeoisie. Only the proletariat, the peasant class, and the petty bourgeoisie (including revolutionary intellectuals) remained in the revolutionary camp. The negative result of the counter-revolutionary "encirclement and suppression" was that Japanese imperialism invaded. Comrade Taofen began to enter the revolutionary camp from this period. Taofen himself said: "'Life Weekly' has become closely related to the reality of society day by day, and the transformation of society at the present stage can never start from individualism; if it is divorced from the transformation of the entire society and haggling over personal issues, this road is impassable. Therefore, 'Life Weekly' should meet the requirements of the times, gradually pay attention to social and political issues, and gradually shift from a personal starting point to a collective starting point." ("Experience," page 105)

The facts are indeed so. The September 18th Incident and the January 28th Incident gave the young, enthusiastic, and resolute Zou Taofen an unbearable shock. With a formidable enemy at hand and the nation in deep crisis, the reactionary ruling class still practiced internal autocratic dictatorship and external submission and surrender. Under the call of the Chinese Communist Party, the people of the whole country shouted out the strong call to oppose internal war and dictatorship and demand resistance against Japan and defense of the country. At this time, "Life Weekly," mainly due to Taofen's personal efforts, reached a circulation of more than 100,000 copies, becoming the publication with the widest readership and the most extensive influence at home and abroad. Taofen realized that this was not an ordinary publication, nor should it be just a forum for a few intellectuals. This was a weapon, a fighting weapon to defend the motherland and defend the interests of the people. He decided to dedicate this fighting weapon unconditionally to the motherland and the masses of the people, in order to save the dying motherland, to serve the suffering people, to break through the darkness, and to move towards the future of light.

Taofen has such a characteristic: when he made a decision, he would overcome all difficulties and carry it out to the end. He did not have the weakness of hesitation and wavering of petty-bourgeois intellectuals. He not only wanted to run "Life Weekly" well, but also to expand it into "Life Daily" to make it a people's bugle call to advocate resistance against Japan and national salvation. He expanded the "Life Weekly Society" into "Life Bookstore" to expand publicity and influence, making it the germination and cornerstone of the Chinese people's publishing cause.

From this time on, the oppression and tribulations suffered by Taofen and the comrades of "Life Bookstore" were countless. "Life Daily" was finally published in Hong Kong after two preparations with the enthusiastic fundraising of readers, although it was only for a very short period. After "Life Weekly" was banned, the subsequent "New Life Weekly," "Popular Life," "Eternal Life," and "Life Weekly" were also closed and banned. Before the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan, Taofen himself was forced to go into exile overseas twice, and was finally thrown into Suzhou Prison. However, whether in the editorial office, in exile, or in prison and detention centers, he was never afraid of difficulties or showed any passivity. In any difficult days, he never left his fighting post, and he never abandoned the cultural cause he was engaged in. Like a heroic soldier on the front line, as long as there was still a possibility of picking up a pen, he never gave up the combat mission. In Suzhou Prison, he wrote the books "Reminiscences of Floating Life" and "Experience." Even when enemy planes were frantically bombing Chongqing, people saw him still burying his head under the dim light of the air-raid shelter and constantly writing.

The hard work and arduous struggle of Comrade Taofen and the comrades of the Life Bookstore he founded and led were by no means in vain. The outbreak of the "December 9th" national salvation movement under the call and leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the surging of the nationwide anti-Japanese national salvation movement, and the final formation of the anti-Japanese national united front, Taofen and the publications he presided over and founded by the Life Bookstore played a not small role in propaganda and mobilization. The books and periodicals published by "Life Bookstore" and other progressive bookstores at that time also played an extremely broad propaganda role in breaking through the cultural "encirclement and suppression" of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and raising the political awareness of the youth and the masses in the reactionary ruling areas.

During the War of Resistance Against Japan, which was also the last period of Taofen's life, Taofen encountered the most painful and unbearable experience of his life, and during this period, Taofen showed unparalleled courage, strength, and optimism. During this period, Taofen went through three or four forced exiles, and finally suffered unbearable physical suffering, groaning on the bed for years, but he still kept writing and waged a relentless struggle against enemies at home and abroad. He persisted in the struggle with Japanese imperialism, he persisted in the struggle with the reactionary ruling class of the Kuomintang, he persisted in the struggle with the capitulationist and wavering elements within the united front, and he also had to persist in the struggle with the disease that entangled his body. When he was in Chongqing and Guilin, he had to deal with the Kuomintang's book and magazine censors every day, deal with the Kuomintang's secret agents who were following him, and deal with the Kuomintang officials who were constantly threatening and enticing him, but he still insisted on his career and insisted on his fighting post. He did not allow the publications he presided over to be delayed for a day; he still had to spend a large part of his time meeting with visiting readers and helping readers solve the problems they wanted to solve. The more and bigger the difficulties, the higher his confidence and the stronger his fighting will. After retreating from Hong Kong, he braved all kinds of hardships to enter the Subei Liberated Area. He came into contact with the people who had turned over and became masters of their own destiny for the first time, which further strengthened his confidence in the final victory of socialism and communism. Until his death, he applied to the CPC Central Committee to accept him as a glorious Communist Party member. His short life limited his great contribution to the people's cause to a certain extent. But Comrade Taofen has reached the glorious end on the road taken by Chinese revolutionary intellectuals. He contributed everything he could contribute to the Chinese people, including his life.

Chairman Mao once said: "The organization of revolutionary forces and the construction of revolutionary undertakings cannot be successful without the participation of revolutionary intellectuals. However, intellectuals, before they are integrated with the revolutionary struggle of the masses, before they are determined to serve the interests of the masses and integrate with the masses, often have tendencies towards subjectivism and individualism. Their thoughts are often empty, and their actions are often wavering. Therefore, although the vast number of revolutionary intellectuals in China have the role of vanguard and bridge, not all of these intellectuals can carry out the revolution to the end. Some of them will break away from the revolutionary ranks and adopt a passive attitude at the critical moment of the revolution; a few of them will become enemies of the revolution. These shortcomings of intellectuals can only be overcome in the long-term mass struggle." (See "The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party," "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," Volume II, page 636)

Intellectuals must be integrated with the revolutionary struggle of the masses, and they must be determined to serve the interests of the masses and integrate with the masses. The fundamental reason why Taofen and his career were able to achieve something lies here. From the time he had not yet entered the revolutionary camp, he already possessed the working attitude of serving the masses and the working method of integrating with the masses. He had this ambition very early on, to take running newspapers and periodicals as his lifelong career, but he never regarded the newspapers and periodicals he ran as private enterprises. In 1928, he raised the question "Whose is 'Life Weekly' after all?" And his conclusion was: "Life Weekly" is ultimately the society's. He once said: "Although the 'short comments' in each issue are only a few hundred words, it is the most painstaking article I write every week. Every time, I must do my best to express my opinions on the things that the general readers think should be said most." ("Experience," page 99) Among Chinese journalists, he was the first to pay attention to the connection with the reader masses. The "mailbox" of "Life Weekly" played the broadest role in connecting with the masses. Later, when Taofen participated in the actual political struggle, his connection with the masses became more extensive and deeper. He was not like some self-proclaimed progressive cultural workers who thought they were standing in the front and despised the long lines of the masses standing behind. Because Taofen had a love for the motherland and the people, he always moved forward with the broad masses, sympathized with them, cared for them, helped them, and did not leave them for a moment. The role of individuals in history is insignificant. The career of individuals can only play a certain historical role when it is closely integrated with the masses of the people. Because he had an inseparable relationship with the people, Taofen was able to truly play the role of vanguard and bridge in the organization of revolutionary forces and the construction of revolutionary undertakings. Precisely because he constantly served the interests of the masses and later participated in the actual struggle of the masses, he was able to achieve not being empty, not wavering, and overcoming the shortcomings of subjectivism and individualism that intellectuals generally have. He is the best example of self-education and transformation for intellectuals from petty-bourgeois origin.

Taofen treated his career and work with an extremely serious and responsible attitude. His articles had clear programs, ruthlessly and fiercely attacking all incorrect and anti-people things, and enthusiastically supporting and supporting all correct and people-benefiting things. He never allowed an ambiguous or unclear article to be published in the publications he edited. He adopted a very strict attitude towards the printing, typesetting, proofreading, cover design, and even advertising and distribution of the publications. He never tolerated any small mistakes, nor did he ignore any small improvements. It can be said that, except for Lu Xun, few authors and editors have been seen to take such a serious attitude towards publishing work as Taofen. And this serious working attitude is the concrete manifestation of the spirit of being responsible to the masses of the people.

Comrade Taofen, his life was short, his work was ordinary, but his contribution to the revolutionary cultural work was huge, and the excellent qualities he showed in political life, work spirit, and dealing with people are not easy to count. Our motherland is carrying out the great cause of socialist construction and transformation. Today, more than in the stage of the new democratic revolution, we need revolutionary intellectuals and outstanding cultural workers like Comrade Taofen a hundred times more. Let us all learn from Comrade Taofen, learn his noble political qualities, learn his unparalleled loyalty to the people's cause, learn his working methods of closely linking with the masses, learn his selfless working spirit, and learn his serious and responsible working attitude towards the people's publishing cause.

### 韬奋和他的事业

专栏：

    编者按：今天是邹韬奋同志逝世十周年纪念日，我们在此发表两篇纪念文章。邹韬奋同志是出色的文化战士，他所主持的各种刊物在人民群众特别是青年群众中有很大的影响。他的不断求进步的精神、认真负责的工作态度和联系群众的优良作风，是值得大家学习的。
    韬奋和他的事业
    胡愈之
    一九四六年七月，当我们在新加坡追悼邹韬奋同志的时候，我曾经说韬奋是一个伟大的爱国者。今天，祖国的面貌完全改变了，我们是在人民的首都纪念这位去世已经十年的亡友，我以为用“伟大的爱国者”来称呼他，仍然是恰如其分的。
    一个伟大的爱国者应当是这样的人：他热爱人民，人民也热爱他；他用一生的不倦怠的劳动为人民大众服务；他把他自己的专长，他所创造的事业和他所能贡献的一切最好的东西无保留地贡献给人民；他时时刻刻捍卫祖国和人民的利益，不惜冒生命的危险和人民的敌人作坚强不屈的斗争。韬奋同志，他是有这一切的优良品质的。他的一生为建立人民的新的出版事业而奋斗。他以无比的忠诚，为人民群众服务，直到最后一息，从不放下他的锋利的武器——笔。他是人民的文化工作者的优良的典范。
    韬奋同志生于一八九五年。他从一个民主主义者逐步转变成为一个共产主义者；韬奋所走的道路也就是中国革命知识分子的道路。但是他进入中国文化革命统一战线的营垒是比较迟的。在中国共产党领导的文化革命的第一时期和第二时期中（一九一九年至一九二七年），韬奋还只是一个天真的、纯朴的、热情的青年。他在帝国主义创办的教会学校（圣约翰大学）受高等教育。当他离开学校投身到现实社会的前后，他和民族资产阶级接触得比较多。青年的邹韬奋曾经有过当工程师的幻想，后来当过会计员和英文教师，最后才选择了新闻工作作为他的终身事业。当“生活周刊”最初创办的时候，韬奋所写的文章，主要是关于青年的个人修养的。当时“生活周刊”的政治主张还只是“力求政治的清明”和“实业的振兴”（“韬奋文录”第八页），这就是当时软弱的中国民族资产阶级的政治纲领。由于幼年教育和生活环境的局限，韬奋并没有被卷入五四运动、五卅运动和北伐战争的狂波巨浪，而只是偶然被浪花所冲击罢了。
    一九二七年以后，文化革命统一战线进入了第三个时期，即新的革命时期。以国民党为代表的中国大资产阶级转到了帝国主义和封建势力的反革命营垒，进行反革命的军事“围剿”和文化“围剿”。民族资产阶级也附和了大资产阶级。革命营垒中只剩下了无产阶级、农民阶级和小资产阶级
  （包括革命知识分子）。反革命“围剿”的消极结果，那就是日本帝国主义打进来了。韬奋同志进入革命的营垒是从这一时期开始的。韬奋自己说：“‘生活周刊’既一天天和社会的现实发生着密切的联系，社会的改造到了现阶段又决不能从个人主义做出发点；如和整个社会的改造脱离关系而斤斤较量个人的问题，这条路是走不通的。于是‘生活周刊’应着时代的要求，渐渐注意于社会的问题和政治的问题，渐渐由个人出发点而转到集体的出发点了。”（“经历”第一○五页）
    事实也确乎如此。九一八事变和一二八战争给与青年的富有热情和毅力的邹韬奋以不可忍受的冲击。大敌当前，国难深重，反动统治阶级仍然是对内专制独裁，对外屈服投降。在中国共产党号召之下，全国人民喊出反对内战独裁，要求抗日御侮的强烈呼声，这时候的“生活周刊”，主要由于韬奋个人的努力，达到十万份以上的销数，成为当时在海内外拥有最广大读者和影响最广泛的刊物。韬奋认识到这不是一个普通的刊物，这也不应该只是少数知识分子的讲坛，这是一个武器，这是捍卫祖国，捍卫人民利益的一个战斗武器。他决定把这个战斗武器无条件地奉献给祖国和人民大众，为的是要挽救垂危的祖国，为的是要服务于苦难的人民，为的是要冲破黑暗，走向未来的光明。
    韬奋有这么个特点，当他作了决定的时候，他是不顾一切困难，非贯彻到底不可的。他没有小资产阶级知识分子犹豫动摇的那种弱点。他不但要办好“生活周刊”，并且要把它扩大成“生活日报”，使它成为鼓吹抗日救亡的人民号角。他把“生活周刊社”扩充为“生活书店”，以扩大宣传影响，使它成为中国人民出版事业的萌芽和基石。
    从这时候起，韬奋和“生活书店”所遭受的压迫和磨折是数不尽的。“生活日报”由于读者的踊跃集资，经过两度的筹办，终于在香港出版了，虽然只是很短的时期。在“生活周刊”被查禁之后，继之而起的“新生周刊”“大众生活”“永生”“生活星期刊”也都遭受封闭和查禁。在抗日战争爆发之前，韬奋自己两度被迫流亡海外，最后还被投入苏州监狱。但是，在编辑室里也好，在流亡生活中也好，在监牢和拘留所里也好，他从不害怕困难，或者表现消极。在任何困难的日子里，他从不离开他的战斗岗位，他从不抛弃他所从事的文化事业。如同在前方的英勇的战士那样，只要还有可能拿起笔来的时候，他从不放弃战斗任务。在苏州监狱中，他写了“萍踪忆语”和“经历”两本书。甚至在重庆敌机疯狂轰炸的时候，人们都看到他还在防空洞昏暗的灯光下埋着头不断地写稿。
    韬奋同志和他所创办和领导的生活书店的同志们的辛勤劳动和坚苦奋斗决不是白费的。在中国共产党号召和领导之下的“一二九”救亡运动的爆发，普遍全国的抗日救亡运动的风起云涌，以及抗日民族统一战线的最后形成，韬奋和他所主持的，由生活书店所创办的刊物是起着不小的宣传鼓动作用的。“生活书店”和其他进步书店在当时出版的书刊，对于冲破蒋介石匪帮的文化“围剿”，提高反动统治地区内青年和人民群众的政治觉悟，也起了极其广大的宣传作用。
    在抗日战争时期，也就是韬奋的生命的最后一个时期中，韬奋遭遇了一生中最痛苦、最不容易忍受的经历，也在这个时期中，韬奋表现了无比的英勇、坚强和乐观主义的精神。在这个时期韬奋经过了三四次的被迫流亡，最后遭受了难以忍受的病苦，经年呻吟床褥，但是他仍然笔不停挥地和内外敌人进行无情的斗争。他和日本帝国主义坚持斗争，他和国民党反动统治阶级坚持斗争，他和统一战线内部的投降动摇分子坚持斗争，他还要和缠绕着自己的身体的病魔坚持斗争。当他在重庆和桂林的时候，他每天要应付国民党的图书杂志检查员，应付跟踪着他的国民党特务，应付不断向他进行威胁利诱的国民党官员，但是他仍然坚持他的事业，坚持他的战斗岗位，他不容许他所主持的刊物延迟一天出版；他仍然要费去一大部分时间接见来访的读者，帮助读者解决所要解决的问题。困难越多越大，他的信心越高，战斗意志也越坚强。从香港撤退以后，他冒着千辛万苦进入苏北解放区，他第一次接触到翻身的人民，更加坚定了他对社会主义共产主义最后胜利的信心。直到临终，他申请中共中央接受他为光荣的共产党员。短促的生命，使他对人民事业的伟大贡献，受了一定的限制。但是韬奋同志，他在中国革命知识分子所走的道路上，已经走到光荣的终点。他向中国人民，贡献了他所能贡献的一切，包含了他的生命在内。
    毛主席曾经说过：“革命力量的组织和革命事业的建设，离开革命的知识分子的参加，是不能成功的。但是，知识分子在其未和群众的革命斗争打成一片，在其未下决心为群众利益服务并与群众相结合的时候，往往带有主观主义和个人主义的倾向，他们的思想往往是空虚的，他们的行动往往是动摇的。因此，中国的广大的革命知识分子虽然有先锋的和桥梁的作用，但不是所有这些知识分子都能革命到底的。其中一部分，到了革命的紧急关头，就会脱离革命队伍，采取消极态度；其中少数人，就会变成革命的敌人。知识分子的这种缺点，只有在长期的群众斗争中才能克服。”（见“中国革命和中国共产党”，“毛泽东选集”第二卷六三六页）
    知识分子要和群众的革命斗争打成一片，要下决心为群众利益服务并与群众相结合，韬奋和他的事业所以能够有所成就，归根结柢原因就在这里。韬奋从他还没有进入革命营垒的时候起，就已经具备了为群众服务的工作态度和与群众相结合的工作方法。他很早就有了这个志愿，要以办报办刊物作为终身职业，但他从没有把他自己所办的报纸刊物作为私人事业。在一九二八年，他就提出“‘生活周刊’究竟是谁的？”这个问题，而他的结论是：“生活周刊”究竟是社会的。他曾说：“每期的‘小言论’虽仅仅数百字，却是我每周最费心血的一篇，每次必尽我心力就一般读者所认为最该说几句话的事情，发表我的意见。”（“经历”第九九页）在中国的新闻工作者中，他是第一个重视和读者群众的联系的。“生活周刊”的“信箱”起了最广泛的联系群众的作用。到了后来，韬奋参加了实际的政治斗争，他和群众的联系更加广泛也更加深入了。他不像有些自命进步的文化工作者那样，自以为站在前面，鄙视着站在后面的漫长的群众行列。由于韬奋具有对于祖国和人民的热爱，他总是和广大群众一起前进，同情他们，关心他们，帮助他们，没有一时一刻脱离他们。个人在历史中的作用是微不足道的，个人的事业，只有在和人民群众密切相结合的时候，才能起一定的历史作用。由于他和人民群众有血肉相连不可分离的关系，韬奋才能在革命力量的组织和革命事业的建设中，真正地起了先锋的和桥梁的作用。也正因为他不断地服务于群众利益，到后来参加群众的实际斗争，他才能做到不空虚，不动摇，克服知识分子一般具有的主观主义、个人主义的缺点。他是小资产阶级出身的知识分子进行自我教育与改造的最优良的榜样。
    韬奋用极端严肃的、认真负责的态度对待事业和工作。他的文章是有明确的纲领的，对一切不正确的反人民的东西进行无情的猛烈的抨击，对一切正确的有利于人民的东西，加以热情的支持和拥护。他从不容许一篇模棱两可或含糊不清的文章登载在他所编辑的刊物上面。他对于刊物的排印、校对、封面设计以至于广告和发行，都采取十分严格的态度。他从不容忍一个任何微小的错误，也从不忽略一个任何细小的改进。可以说，除了鲁迅以外，很少见到一个作者和编辑者像韬奋那样对出版工作采取认真态度的。而这种认真的工作态度，也就是对人民群众的负责精神的具体表现。
  韬奋同志，他的生命很短促，他的工作很平凡，但是他对革命的文化工作的贡献是巨大的，他在政治生活、工作精神和待人接物方面所表现的优良品质是不容易数得清的。我们祖国正在进行社会主义建设和改造的伟大事业，在今天，比在新民主主义革命阶段，更加百倍地需要像韬奋同志那样的崇高的革命知识分子和优秀的文化工作者。让我们大家都向韬奋同志学习，学习他的崇高的政治品质，学习他对人民事业的无比忠诚，学习他的紧密联系群众的工作方法，学习他的忘我的劳动精神，学习他对人民出版事业的认真负责的严肃的工作态度。（附图片）
