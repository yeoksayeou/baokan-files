    At the Foot of Tam Đảo Mountain
    ——One of the Sketches of Rural Vietnam
    Zhǎn Cháo
    The slanting rays of the setting sun pierced through the clouds, making Tam Đảo Mountain, the summer resort in northern Vietnam, look exceptionally beautiful.
    This well-known mountain peak resembles three emerald green islands, closely linked together. Sometimes it stands there in distinct layers; other times, it hides intermittently behind a veil of mist.
    Near Tam Đảo Mountain is a hilly area where the mountains and plains of northern Vietnam alternate. This famous mountain, with its elegant peaks, cuts through the undulating land from west to east, dividing Vĩnh Phúc Province and Thái Nguyên Province into north and south. On the north side, nestled at the foot of the mountain, is Đại Từ District in Thái Nguyên Province. Not long ago, Vietnam's historically significant land reform movement was first implemented here.
    In the evening, we completed the final leg of our journey, crossed a rather long log bridge, and arrived at Tân Thái Commune. This is one of the six communes in Đại Từ District where land reform was initially piloted.
    Tân Thái Commune has many characteristics of rural northern Vietnam. Low farmhouses, sometimes scattered and sometimes concentrated, form sparse villages alongside the rice paddies. Next to these villages, called "thôn," there is usually a bamboo grove of varying sizes.
    A man-made canal runs through the middle of Tân Thái Commune, and almost all ten thôn in the commune can use this canal to irrigate their fields. When we arrived, the farmers were heading home from the fields, and the children were returning from school or from herding. Many people were swimming in the deep part of the river bend, and not far away were several water buffalo, contentedly breathing with their noses exposed above the water.
    I followed the land reform work team cadres to an ordinary farmhouse by the river, the home of Nguyễn Văn Nhàn, the secretary (chairman) of the commune's farmers' association. The host was just in the house, and he and his mother warmly greeted us. At night, they settled us in the outer room of their house.
    Nguyễn Văn Nhàn is a landless peasant under thirty years old, a member of the Vietnamese Labor Party. He actively led the peasants in the struggle during the land reform movement and was elected as the secretary of the commune's farmers' association. His family consists of three people: his mother, who is not very strong, cooks and raises livestock at home; his wife, an activist, who at that time had set off with the commune's labor team to build roads dozens of kilometers away; and Nguyễn Văn Nhàn himself, who is busy working and persisting in production. When we arrived, he had just returned from the fields, and after eating dinner hastily, he took a "bottle lamp" and went to a meeting. That night, it was a meeting of peasant representatives from one thôn, focusing on how to rationally distribute the remaining one-plus acre of land to farmers who needed it. This was a rather complicated task, and a decision could only be made after thorough discussion and research by the masses. Nguyễn Văn Nhàn presided over the meeting until late at night before returning home, and the next day, he got up before dawn to go to the fields to produce.
    We stayed in Tân Thái Commune for a total of two and a half days, and we visited many farmers' families one by one. Some of these farmers had just moved into newly built houses, while others, two or three families together, had moved into the spacious courtyards of the despotic landlords. I noticed that all the farmers' homes had one common item that was indispensable: a portrait of President Hồ Chí Minh. These portraits of the leader, which people had carefully cut out from newspapers and magazines, or copied, were always hung in the most prominent place in the entire house, and were often accompanied by such Vietnamese slogans as: "Long Live the Vietnamese Labor Party!" "Long Live President Hồ!"
    Nguyễn Văn Kỳ, a farmer who had been emancipated, grabbed my hand tightly and led me to his house, insisting that I drink a bowl of strong tea. This old farmer, who was already over sixty but looked quite strong, sat down on the doorstep opposite me with a large bamboo water pipe, and spoke with some excitement about his own and all the commune's farmers' past miserable experiences and the joy after emancipation.
    More than fifty years ago, Tân Thái Commune was still a barren wilderness. At that time, only some farmers who had been oppressed by landlords and French colonists in the Red River Delta and had no way to survive fled here. They worked diligently and finally opened up more than thirty acres of land (North Vietnamese acres, each acre equal to five and a half Chinese acres) near the small hill called Chicken Nest Mountain, in the center of today's Tân Thái Commune. In 1902, the French colonialist De Montbaron and a priest came, casually drew a map, and declared that all 390-plus acres of land around Chicken Nest Mountain and on the right bank of the man-made canal belonged to them, and established a "plantation." Later, De Montbaron also lured disaster victims from Thái Bình Province and Nam Định Province to come and cultivate the wasteland, saying that the wasteland they reclaimed would belong to them. In fact, wherever the farmers cultivated, he would seize it, and he would also levy heavy rents. By 1917, another colonialist, Gallais, took over the "plantation" and became even more unscrupulous. He privately formulated "land regulations," forced farmers to sign "contracts," and ordered farmers to pay rent regardless of drought or flood, and also to provide unpaid labor for the "plantation," etc. The rent per acre quickly rose from ten buckets (each bucket twenty kilograms), twelve buckets to twenty buckets, twenty-five buckets, and some even reached thirty buckets. In addition to handing over all their harvests, the farmers also had to sign and put their fingerprints on the "plantation's" account books. Many farmers, unable to endure this cruel oppression, secretly fled.
    On the left bank of the man-made canal, there was another "plantation," occupying a total of more than 110 acres of land. This "plantation" was also "established" by the French colonialist De Montbaron and a priest in 1904, using the same methods. In 1930, this "plantation" was transferred from the hands of the colonialists to the Vietnamese landlord Đỗ Đình Đạo. Đỗ Đình Đạo was a big landlord in northern Vietnam. Relying on the power of imperialism, he committed all kinds of evil deeds in the "plantation" and exploited the farmers without limit.
    In addition to the two large "plantations," Tân Thái Commune also had many estates belonging to twelve local or foreign landlords. These estates, almost all seized from the farmers, were scattered in every corner of the commune and echoed the two major "plantations," forming a net that ruled over the farmers. Many farmers who could not survive in the plains because of the squeeze fled here with their families, hoping to find a place to settle down. But when they could no longer struggle in the net of the colonists and landlords, they had no choice but to wander elsewhere. Farmers from elsewhere quickly filled their positions.
    This is a bleak picture of Tân Thái Commune before the August Revolution.
    By August 1945, when the August Revolution succeeded, Tân Thái Commune, like many rural areas in the Vietnamese liberated areas, had basically destroyed the rule of the French colonists and established a people's government. However, the reactionary landlord class was not willing to die. They disguised their status, concealed or dispersed their land, and even sneaked into the grassroots organizations of the commune's resistance administrative committee and even the Vietnamese Labor Party, attempting to completely transform these departments and maintain the ruling position of the landlord class in the countryside.
    In the autumn of 1953, the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Labor Party, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and President Hồ Chí Minh sent a work team to Tân Thái Commune to mobilize the masses and carry out a vigorous rent reduction and land reform movement. Those despotic landlords and "plantation" managers who used to ride on the necks of the farmers all lowered their heads and confessed their crimes in the farmers' grievance and reasoning struggles. The democratic government supported the farmers' reasonable demands and executed the despotic landlord Đặng Viết Khang, who had killed six farmers, seized dozens of acres of farmland, and was also preparing to welcome the French invading army. The democratic government also detained two "plantation" managers, Hoàng Xuân Hộ and Hoàng Văn Ngân, according to the farmers' demands. These two guys were not only accomplices of the French colonialists, but also took advantage of their power to seize the farmers' land, and each had more than two blood debts on their hands.
    By the spring of 1954, the land reform movement in Tân Thái Commune had completely and victoriously ended. The farmers excitedly planted boundary markers on the edges of the land they had been allocated. This land, which they had cultivated with their own hands in the past, had now returned to them.
    Nguyễn Văn Kỳ, who had never owned a piece of land as big as his foot in generations, received a total of 1.2 acres of land, one-third of a head of cattle, and a plow this time. When he accepted these things, he was so moved that he wept. He said: "The kindness of the Party, the government, and President Hồ is even greater than that of our own parents!" From then on, this old farmer got up early and went to collect manure in the dark. He said that he had to compost a load of fertilizer every day to feed the fields well and respond to President Hồ's call to increase production.
    Not only Nguyễn Văn Kỳ alone, but all the farmers in Tân Thái Commune this year are paying great attention to accumulating fertilizer. Even the Tày and Dao ethnic farmers, who had always superstitiously believed that manure would damage the crops, are actively digging manure pits. In Tháp Hoang thôn, where the ethnic minorities are more concentrated, more than twenty "manure pits" appeared in a very short period of time, something that had never happened before.
    The rural landscape after land reform is truly焕然一新 [completely renewed].
    In the past, due to the instigation of the imperialists and feudal landlords, the relationship between the various ethnic groups was very disharmonious. After land reform, the Kinh, Tày, and Dao farmers of Tân Thái Commune not only visited each other, but also helped each other in mutual aid and exchange labor. During this year's summer plowing season, farmers of all ethnic groups voluntarily raised thirty buckets of rice seeds, 250 kilograms of cassava, sweet potatoes, and other miscellaneous grains to help twenty-eight farmers who had just been emancipated and had relatively weak family foundations solve their difficulties. Not long after the land reform, farmers of all ethnic groups in the commune launched a continuous assault for several days and finally built a river embankment more than 200 meters long, so that more than 20 acres of land on the right bank of the man-made canal would be spared from flooding in the rainy season. People are now brewing to build two new canals in two other places. When this plan is realized, 150 acres of single-cropping rice fields will be turned into double-cropping rice fields.
    Many farmers who had lost their houses in the past have rebuilt their families with everyone's help. When I was in Tân Thái Commune, five farm laborers and two poor peasants had already moved into their own new houses. These typical Vietnamese farmhouses mostly have a circle of bamboo fences outside, with a small patio inside. The houses are located on slightly higher foundations, and under the roofs made of thatch and bamboo strips are solid earthen walls and movable doors and windows. An elderly farmer named Đặng Văn Cảnh, fifty-seven years old, had his land seized by the landlord in the past, and he and his wife had to go out separately to work as hired laborers. After land reform, they received 1.5 acres of land, one-third of a head of cattle, and a house, and the old couple reunited.
    In the rural areas that have completed land reform, there are also many special happy events. Just after the land was distributed, six couples of male and female farmers got married. According to the male's class composition, these six newly married couples consist of three farm laborer households, two poor peasant households, and one middle peasant household. Except for the middle peasant, the marriage ages are relatively high. Two poor peasants, one thirty-nine years old and one forty-two years old. According to the customs of this area in the past, it was really not easy to get married. The man had to first send a dowry of a cow, a pair of gold earrings, a pair of silver necklaces, and two sets of fine clothes, and on the day of the wedding, he had to invite everyone in the village to a feast. There was a saying in society: "Who would marry their daughters to those people in ragged clothes!" At that time, it was difficult for poor peasants to get married. But now it is different. As long as the man and woman are willing, they can register at the commune's resistance administrative committee, and on the wedding day, they can hold a party in the village. After the representative of the commune's resistance administrative committee announces the marriage, everyone can freely speak, drink tea, and sing songs, and that is considered a marriage. On the day of the wedding of farm laborer Trịnh Văn Nhĩ and Đặng Văn Hoa, poor peasant Ngô Văn Triệu also went to attend their wedding. In 1944, Ngô Văn Triệu borrowed 51 yuan from the landlord for his wedding, and as a result, he mortgaged 1.7 acres of land and five rooms to the landlord Nguyễn Tôn, and only turned over this time during the land reform. At the wedding of his class brother, Ngô Văn Triệu could hardly suppress the joy in his heart. He pointed to the portrait of President Hồ under the red flag with five stars and said: "We must follow Uncle, follow the Party to the end."
    On a hot noon, I left Tân Thái Commune with a sense of reluctance. Those farmers who had once cordially chatted with me about their families, some were silently writing new words in the farmers' literacy class, and some were studying in the cadres' cram school. As we passed through the dense rice paddies, past the ruins of the French colonialist "plantation" management office on Chicken Nest Mountain, and headed towards that log bridge, we could still see from afar a small bamboo pavilion erected on a very tall wooden pole—Tân Thái Commune's "radio station." At this time, someone was using a zinc horn to report the news. One could hear that it was about the victory at Điện Biên Phủ.

    在三岛山下
    ——越南农村散记之一
    展潮
    夕阳的斜辉透过了云层，把越南北部的避暑胜地—三岛山，映衬得格外的好看。
    这座远近闻名的山峰，仿佛是三个翠绿色的岛屿似的，紧紧地联结在一起。有时候，它层次分明地站在那里；有时候，它又忽隐忽现地躲到烟雾的纱缦后面去了。
    三岛山左近，是北越的山区和平原互相交替的丘陵地带。这座名山以它挺秀的峰峦，自西向东穿过那些波纹起伏的土地，刚好把永福省和太原省分在南北两面。在北面，傍依着山脚，是太原省的大慈县。不久以前，越南人民富有历史意义的土地改革运动，就是在这里首先实现的。
    傍晚，我们完成了最后的行程，走过一条相当长的独木桥，来到了新泰社。这是大慈县最初试行土地改革的六个社中的一个。
    新泰社具有北越农村的许多特色。一座座低矮的农舍，时而分散、时而集中，在稻田旁边形成一个个疏疏落落的村庄。在这些叫做“屯”的村庄旁边，通常都有一片或大或小的竹丛。
    有一条工河从新泰社中间穿过，全社十个屯差不多都可以利用这条河水灌溉田地。我们来到的时候，农民正打田间往家里走，少年儿童也从学校里或者牧放的地方回来了。河湾深处有许多人在那里游泳，离得不远的地方是几条水牛，它们正满足地把鼻子露在水面上呼吸。
    我随着土地改革工作队的干部走向河边的一座普通的农舍，这是社农会书记（主席）阮文闲的家。这时主人刚好在屋子里，他和他的母亲热情地迎接我们。夜间，便把我们安顿在他家的外间住下。
    阮文闲是个不满三十岁的雇农，越南劳动党党员，他在土地改革运动中积极地领导农民进行斗争，被大家选做社的农会书记。他一家三口人：母亲身体不大壮实，在家里烧饭和喂养牲畜；妻子是个积极分子，当时正随着社的民工队出发，到几十公里以外去修筑公路；阮文闲自己一面工作、一面坚持生产，是够忙的。我们到的时候，他刚从田里回来，匆匆忙忙吃过晚饭，便提着一盏“瓶子灯”开会去了。那天晚上开的是一个屯子的农民代表会，中心是要把剩余的一亩多田合理地填补到需要土地的农民手里。这是一桩相当繁杂的工作，必须让群众充分地讨论研究后才能作出决定。阮文闲主持会议一直到深夜才回家，第二天天蒙蒙亮就又爬起来到田里生产去了。
    在新泰社一共住了两天半，我们挨户地探望了许多农民的家庭。这些农民，有的刚刚挪到新盖起来的屋子里，有的两三户人家一起搬进了恶霸地主宽阔的庭院。我注意到，所有的农家都缺少不了一样共同的物品，那就是胡志明主席的像。这些被人们郑重地从报刊上剪裁下来的、或者是临摹下来的领袖像，总是被张挂在整个屋子最显要的地方，并且往往还附着这样的越文标语：“越南劳动党万岁！”“胡主席万岁！”
    翻身农民阮文其紧紧抓住我的手，把我领到他家里，坚持地要我喝一碗浓茶。这位已经六十多岁但是看起来还相当壮实的老农民，端着一个大竹筒做的水烟袋，在我对面的门坎上坐下来，稍微有点激动地谈到他自己和全社农民过去悲惨的遭遇以及翻身后的喜悦。
    五十多年以前，新泰社还是一片荒山野地，当时只有一些在红河三角洲被地主和法国殖民者压榨得没有活路的农民逃来这里，他们辛勤地劳作，终于在今天新泰社的中心那座小山丘——鸡巢山附近开辟出了三十多亩田（北越亩，每亩等于中国五亩半）。到一九零二年，法国殖民主义分子德蒙巴干和义神甫来了，随便画了一张地图，宣布鸡巢山四周、工河右岸的三百九十多亩田地全部归他们所有，成立了“田庄”。后来，德蒙巴干又诱骗太平省和南定省的灾民上来开荒，说开出来的荒地归自己所有，事实上农民开垦到那里他便霸占到那里，并且还要课以重租。到一九一七年，另外一个殖民主义分子加里来接管“田庄”，就更变本加厉了。他私自制定“土地法规”，强迫农民签订“合同”，限令农民不论天旱水涝都得一律交租，并且还要无偿地为“田庄”服劳役等等。每亩田租，迅速地从十桶（每桶二十公斤）、十二桶上升到二十桶、二十五桶，有的甚至达到三十桶。农民们除了把全部收获都缴纳出来之外，还要在“田庄”的账本上签字画押。许多农民因为忍受不住这种残酷的压榨，便偷偷地逃散了。
    在工河左岸，还有另外一个“田庄”，一共占据了一百一十多亩田。这个“田庄”，也是由法国殖民主义分子德蒙巴干和义神甫采取同样的手段，在一九零四年“建立”起来的。一九三零年，这个
  “田庄”从殖民主义分子手里转移到越南地主杜庭道手里。杜庭道是北越的大地主，他凭借着帝国主义的势力，在“田庄”里为非作歹，无限度地剥削农民。
    除了两个大“田庄”之外，新泰社还有许多属于十二户本地或者外来地主的庄园。这些几乎都是从农民手里霸占去的庄园，散布在全社各个角落里，和两大“田庄”互相呼应，形成了一个对农民统治的罗网。许多在平原被挤压得没有办法活下去的农民，扶老携幼地逃跑到这里，原想找到一个落脚的地方。但是当他们在殖民者和地主的罗网里再也挣扎不下去的时候，又只好流落他方。从别处来的农民，又很快地填补了他们的位置。
    这就是“八月革命”以前，新泰社的一幅惨淡的图画。
    到一九四五年八月革命成功了，新泰社也和越南解放区的许多农村一样，基本上摧垮了法国殖民者的统治，建立了人民的政权。但是反动的地主阶级并不甘心于死亡，他们涂改成份，隐瞒或者分散田地，并且钻到社抗战行政委员会甚至越南劳动党的基层组织中来，企图使这些部门完全变质，维持地主阶级在农村中的统治地位。
    一九五三年秋天，越南劳动党中央、越南民主共和国政府和胡志明主席派来了工作队，在新泰社发动群众，进行了轰轰烈烈的减租和土地改革运动。那些过去骑在农民脖子上的恶霸地主和“田庄”管理员，都在农民的诉苦说理斗争中低头认罪了。民主政府支持了农民合理的要求，枪毙了恶霸地主邓曰康，他曾经杀死六个农民、霸占几十亩农田，并且还准备去迎接法国侵略军。民主政府还按照农民的要求，扣押了两个“田庄”管理员黄春护、黄文银，这两个家伙不仅是法国殖民主义分子的帮凶，还仗势霸占农民的田地，并且每一个都有两条人命以上的血债。
    到一九五四年春天，新泰社的土地改革运动全部胜利地结束了。农民们兴奋地在分得的田边插上了界标，这些过去曾是他们用双手开垦出来的田地，现在又回到他们手里来了。
    几辈子连一块脚板大的田地还没有过的阮文其，这次一共分得了一亩二分田、三分之一头耕牛和一副犁。当他接受这些东西的时候，激动得流泪，他说：“党、政府和胡主席的恩情，真是比亲生父母的还大”！从此以后，这位老农民便起早搭黑地去拾粪，他说他每天要沤够一挑肥，好把田喂得饱饱的，响应胡主席增加生产的号召。
    不仅阮文其一个人，全新泰社农民今年都很重视积肥，连过去一直迷信粪便会把庄稼薰坏的土族和寨族农民，也积极地掏挖粪坑。少数民族比较集中的塔黄屯，在很短的期间内，就出现了二十多个从来也没有过的“粪坑”。
    土地改革后的农村面貌，真是焕然一新。
    过去由于帝国主义和封建地主的挑拨离间，各民族之间的关系是很不融洽的。土地改革以后，新泰社的京族、土族和寨族农民不仅互相往还，而且还在一起互助变工。今年夏耕的时候，各族农民自动地募集了三十桶谷种、二百五十公斤木薯、红薯以及别的一些杂粮，帮助二十八户刚翻身家底比较薄的农民解决了困难。土地改革后不久，全社各族农民连续突击了几天，终于修成了一条二百多公尺长的河堤。使工河右岸的二十多亩田在雨季里免遭水淹。人们现在正酝酿着在另外的两个地方修筑两道新水渠，当这个计划实现的时候，将有一百五十亩一季稻田变成两季稻田。
    许多过去失掉了房舍的农民，在大家的帮助下重新建立了自己的家庭。我在新泰社的时候，已经有五个雇农和两个贫农搬进属于他们自己的新屋子里。这些典型的越南农舍，多数是在外面围上一圈竹篱笆，里面留着一块小天井，房子座落在稍为高一点的地基上，在用茅草和竹片盖成的屋顶下面，是坚实的土墙和可以活动的门窗。有一个叫邓文景的五十七岁的老年农民，过去田地叫地主霸占了，夫妇两人不得不分别出去当雇工。土地改革以后，他们分得了一亩五分田、三分之一头牛，还有一座房子，老两口又回到一块来团聚。
    完成了土地改革的农村，喜事也特别的多。刚分配过田地，就有六对男女农民结婚。这六对新婚夫妇，要是按照男方成份来算，就是三户雇农、两户贫农和一户中农。除了中农，结婚年龄都比较大。两个贫农，一个三十九岁，一个四十二岁。按照这一带以前的风俗，要结婚可真不容易，男方必须先送一条牛、一双金耳环、一对银项圈和两套细料衣服的聘礼，到娶亲的那天还得请全屯人吃一顿酒席。社会上流行着这样的一句话：“那有女儿嫁给那些衣服破烂的人！”当时贫苦的农民是很难得结婚的。可是现在不同了，只要男女双方自愿，到社抗战行政委员会去登记，结婚那天在屯里开个联欢会，由社抗战行政委员会的代表宣布之后，大家随意地讲讲话、喝喝茶、唱唱歌，就算是完婚了。雇农郑文耳和邓文花结婚的那天，贫农吴文兆也去参加了他们的婚礼。一九四四年，吴文兆因为结婚借了地主五十一块钱，结果把一亩七分田和五间房统统都押给地主阮尊，直到这次土地改革才翻了身。在自己阶级弟兄的婚礼会上，吴文兆简直压抑不住心头的高兴，他指着在金星红旗下的胡主席像说：“我们要跟着伯伯、跟着党走到底。”
    在一个炎热的中午，我怀着依恋的心情离开了新泰社。那些曾经在一起亲切地叙谈过家常的农民们，有的正在农民识字班里默写生字，有的正在干部补习班里学习。当我们穿过了茂密的稻田，从鸡巢山法国殖民主义分子“田庄”管理处的废墟旁边经过，走向那条独木桥的时候，远远地还可以看得见一座架在非常高大的木杆上的小竹阁——新泰社农民的“广播电台”，这时候正有人在用锌质的喇叭筒报告新闻，可以听出那是关于奠边府胜利的消息。
