Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, July 25th: Premier Zhou Enlai of the People's Republic of China, accompanied by Zhang Wentian, Wang Bingnan, Lei Renmin, and Qiao Guanhua, visited the "Karl Liebknecht" Transformer Factory in Berlin at 10:00 AM on the 24th.

German officials accompanying the visit included: Deputy Prime Ministers Loch and Schulz of the German Democratic Republic, Political Bureau members Mattern and Sidwan of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, Mayor of Greater Berlin Ebert, and heads of German government and various people's organizations.

Premier Zhou Enlai was warmly welcomed by all the factory workers. At the workers' welcome rally held after the tour, Premier Zhou Enlai delivered the following speech:

Comrade Chairman of the Trade Union, Comrade Director, Comrade Mayor, Dear Worker Comrades:

I am very pleased to have the opportunity to visit the Berlin Transformer Factory, one of the important enterprises in the electrical industry of the German Democratic Republic, named after the heroic German communist Karl Liebknecht, during my visit to the German Democratic Republic. I now extend my respects to you, and through you, to the entire German working class.

Germany is a country with developed industrial production and science and technology, and its electrical machinery manufacturing industry is world-renowned. Now, these industrial production and advanced science and technology in Germany are partly in the hands of the people, and are serving the development of the national economy and the improvement of people's lives in the German Democratic Republic. German workers and engineering technicians have made great contributions to the development of industrial production and science and technology.

Currently, China is undergoing a transition from a backward agricultural country to a powerful and advanced socialist industrial country. In the peaceful, democratic, and socialist camp, China has a population of 600 million, but China is still a backward agricultural country. In order to achieve the great task of national industrialization, the Chinese people need economic cooperation and technical assistance in various fields. I believe that the German people are willing to cooperate with us and can provide us with this kind of help, and you have already given this help. The fact that your factory supplies 8% of its products to China is a good proof of this.

The achievements of the German working class in industrial production and science and technology are a great contribution not only to their own country but also to the whole world. The development of the national economy and the improvement of people's lives in the German Democratic Republic are inspiring the people of West Germany to fight for democracy and freedom.

Peace, unification, and independence have become the unanimous demands of the entire German people. The Geneva Conference has provided an example for resolving international issues through consultation. After the cessation of war in Korea and Indochina, the possibility of resolving international disputes peacefully on a worldwide scale has greatly increased. The Geneva Conference not only reached an agreement on the cessation of hostilities in Vietnam in resolving the issue of restoring peace in Indochina, but also stipulated the principle of a political solution after the ceasefire through regular general elections to achieve the peaceful reunification of Vietnam, which brings new hope for the peaceful reunification of Germany and Korea.

Comrades, your hard work will not only strengthen the power of the German Democratic Republic and improve your own lives, but also bring happiness to the working people of the whole world.

Please allow me to congratulate you on achieving further success on the labor production front!

Long live the German working class!

Long live the great unity of the workers all over the world!

Long live the friendly cooperation between the people of Germany and China!

Long live the peace and democracy forces headed by the Soviet Union!

    周总理参观卡尔·李卜克内西变压器工厂
    并在全厂工人欢迎大会上发表了演讲
    【新华社柏林二十五日电】中华人民共和国总理周恩来偕张闻天、王炳南、雷任民、乔冠华等于二十四日上午十时参观了柏林“卡尔·李卜克内西”变压器工厂。
    德国方面陪同前往参观的有：德意志民主共和国副总理洛赫、舒尔茨，德国统一社会党中央委员会政治局委员马特恩、希德万，大柏林市长艾柏特以及德国政府和各人民团体的负责人。
    周恩来总理受到了全厂工人的热烈欢迎。在参观完毕以后举行的全厂工人欢迎大会上，周恩来总理发表了如下的讲演：
    职工会主席同志、厂长同志、市长同志、亲爱的工人同志们：
    我在访问德意志民主共和国期间能有机会参观以德国英勇的共产主义者卡尔·李卜克内西的名字命名的、德意志民主共和国电气工业中重要企业之一的柏林变压器工厂，我感到非常高兴。我现在向你们、并通过你们向全德意志的工人阶级致敬。
    德意志是工业生产和科学技术发达的国家，它的电机制造工业更是举世闻名的；现在德意志的这些工业生产和进步的科学技术已经部分地掌握在人民的手里，正在为发展德意志民主共和国的国民经济和改善人民生活而服务。德国工人和工程技术人员对于发展工业生产和科学技术事业的贡献是很大的。
      目前中国正在经历着由落后的农业国逐步走上强大的先进的社会主义的工业国的过渡时期，在和平民主社会主义阵营中，中国有着六亿人口，但是中国仍然是一个落后的农业国；中国人民为了实现国家工业化这一伟大任务，它是需要各方面的经济合作和技术援助的。我相信德意志人民是愿意和我们合作并能够给我们这种帮助的，并且你们已经给了这种帮助，你们的工厂以百分之八的生产品供给中国，就是一个很好的证明。
    德国工人阶级在工业生产和科学技术方面的成就，不仅对自己的祖国而且对全世界都是巨大的贡献。德意志民主共和国国民经济的发展、人民生活的改善，鼓舞着西德人民争取民主、自由的斗争。
    和平、统一、独立已经成为全德人民的一致要求。日内瓦会议已经为经由协商解决国际问题提供了一个榜样；朝鲜和印度支那的战争停止后，全世界范围内以和平方式解决国际争端的可能性大为增长。日内瓦会议在解决恢复印度支那和平问题方面不仅达成了越南停战的协议，而且还规定了停战后经过双方协商定期举行普选以实现越南和平统一的政治解决原则，这就给德国和朝鲜的和平统一问题的解决带来了新的希望。
    同志们，你们的辛勤劳动不仅将加强德意志民主共和国的力量、改善自己的生活，而且将为全世界劳动人民带来幸福。
    请允许我祝贺你们在劳动生产战线上获得进一步的成就。
    德意志工人阶级万岁！
    全世界工人大团结万岁！
    德、中两国人民的友好合作万岁！
    以苏联为首的和平民主力量万岁！
