(Xinhua News Agency, July 17th) In the month since the draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China was promulgated, nearly one million people in the capital have discussed the draft Constitution or heard reports on its spirit and basic content.

    In order to enable people from all walks of life to understand the essence of the draft Constitution, the Beijing Municipal Draft Constitution Discussion Committee trained 4,000 reporters, who have given many reports in factories, enterprises, government offices, schools, construction sites, villages, and streets. Report meetings and discussion meetings on the draft Constitution are still being held successively. More than 5,000 blackboards throughout the city feature publicity about the draft Constitution as their main content. The Beijing People's Broadcasting Station explains the draft Constitution to the people of the city every day. The first stage of publicity and discussion in major state-owned factories and mines, which started earlier, is nearing completion, and workers are preparing to conduct a more in-depth discussion of the draft Constitution. Workers at various construction sites and private factories also began discussions successively in early July. Farmers in the suburbs are using breaks in production to conduct discussions. In the Nanyuan District, eleven townships were in the first batch to discuss the draft Constitution. Institutions of higher learning, literary and art circles, street residents, business circles, ethnic minorities, and religious circles have generally carried out publicity and discussions, among which people in literary and art, business, and religious circles have successively conducted three to four discussions. In late July, the activities of publicizing and discussing the draft Constitution by people from all walks of life in the capital will be carried out more deeply and widely.

  The people of the capital demonstrated sincere support and love in the publicity and discussion of the draft Constitution. The Xinhua Bookstore Beijing Branch sold 740,000 copies of the single edition of the draft Constitution and publications such as "China Youth" and "Study" that published the draft Constitution in the past month. The 1,000 copies of the "Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China" single edition sent by the bookstore to the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant were bought up by the workers in less than a quarter of an hour. People from all walks of life enthusiastically participated in report meetings on the draft Constitution. When the Anjiatan Mine of the Jingxi Mining Bureau held a report meeting on June 23, many workers braved the rain and traveled from four to five miles away to participate; workers from the Tianfeng Sauce Garden in the Xidan District, except for one person left to watch the door, all participated in the report meeting; an old lady named Liu from Youfang Hutong in this district felt very good after listening to the report in the morning and rushed to another report meeting in the afternoon to listen again. People all said: The reporter's report really spoke to our hearts.

    In the publicity and discussion of the draft Constitution, people from all walks of life in the capital, based on their own personal experiences, realized that the draft Constitution consolidated the various freedoms and rights they had already obtained, thus enhancing their love for the current new life and their determination to fight resolutely for the realization of socialism. Hou Decheng, a model worker in Beijing and a worker at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, was a poor child who was looked down upon in the past. He was elected as a people's representative of the district in the general election and was recently elected as a people's representative of the city at the district people's congress meeting. When discussing the draft Constitution, he said: I don't know how many martyrs sacrificed to realize the ideal of a socialist society, I must fight to the end for the unfinished cause of the martyrs. He Defu, an old driver of the Beijing Tram Company, was fired by the company before liberation and wandered around due to the pressure of life. He did not return to the company until after liberation. This year, he was elected as a model worker of the company and was also promoted to dispatcher. His daughter also became a tram driver and was elected as a people's representative of the district. This old man, who has experienced many hardships, has a very deep feeling about the draft Constitution. He said: For the happiness of the next generation, I will contribute all my strength to the great cause of socialist construction. Li Shuqing, a female worker in the dyeing workshop of the Qinghe Woolen Mill, was fired and unemployed three times before liberation after giving birth three times. Now that the factory has established a nursery, female workers can not only rest after giving birth but also receive their wages as usual. The workers expressed their determination to celebrate the promulgation of the draft Constitution with new production achievements. Liu Shimei, a national textile industry model worker and a female worker at the Qinghe Woolen Mill, led her group to propose a plan to guarantee the completion of the group's annual increase of 650 million yuan in output value. After listening to the report on the draft Constitution, the Pan Yutong class of the Chengzi Mine of the Jingxi Mining Bureau had a high production mood and completed the June production task five days ahead of schedule. Everyone unanimously expressed their determination to fulfill their due obligations as citizens and expand the achievements of the people's revolution.

    首都近百万人讨论了宪法草案
    【新华社十七日讯】中华人民共和国宪法草案公布后的一个月中，首都已有近百万人对宪法草案进行了讨论，或听到了关于宪法草案的精神和基本内容的报告。
    北京市宪法草案讨论委员会为了使各界人民都能了解宪法草案的精神实质，训练了四千名报告员，已经在工厂、企业、机关、学校、建筑工地、乡村、街道作了很多次报告。现在宪法草案的报告会、讨论会仍在陆续举行。全市五千多块黑板报都以宣传宪法草案为主要内容。北京人民广播电台每天向全市人民进行宪法草案的解说。开始讨论较早的各大国营厂矿第一阶段的宣传讨论已近结束，职工们正准备对宪法草案作更深入的讨论。各建筑工地和私营工厂的职工也在七月上旬陆续开始讨论。郊区农民利用生产空隙时间进行讨论。南苑区第一批讨论宪法草案的有十一个乡。各高等学校、文艺界、街道居民、工商界、少数民族、宗教界等已经普遍进行了宣传讨论，其中文艺、工商、宗教等界人士已先后进行了三次到四次的讨论。七月下旬，首都各界人民宣传和讨论宪法草案的活动将更加深入广泛地开展起来。
  首都人民在宣传和讨论宪法草案中，表现了真诚拥护和热爱的心情。新华书店北京分店发售的宪法草案单行本与刊载宪法草案的“中国青年”、“学习”等刊物，近一个月来销售了七十四万份。书店送到石景山钢铁厂的一千本“中华人民共和国宪法草案”单行本，不到一刻钟便被职工购买一空。各界人民踊跃参加宪法草案的报告会。京西矿务局安家滩矿六月二十三日举行报告会时，许多工人冒雨从四、五里路以外赶来参加；西单区私营天丰酱园的工人，除留一人看门外，全部参加了报告会；这个区油坊胡同一位刘老太太，在一个上午听报告后，感到很好，下午又赶到另一个报告会去听。人民都说：报告员的报告真讲到我们心里去了。
    在宪法草案的宣传和讨论中，首都各界人民根据自己切身的经历，认识到宪法草案巩固了他们已经得到的各种自由和权利，因而增强了对目前新生活的热爱和为实现社会主义而坚决奋斗的决心。北京市劳动模范、石景山钢铁厂工人侯德成，过去是被人看不起的穷孩子，普选中被选为区人民代表，最近在召开的区人民代表大会会议上又被选为市人民代表。他在讨论宪法草案时说：不知有多少先烈为了实现社会主义社会的理想而牺牲了，我一定要为先烈的未竟事业奋斗到底。北京市电车公司老司机何德福，解放前被公司开除了，为生活所迫到处流浪，解放后才回到公司里来。今年他被选为公司的劳动模范，还被提升为调度员。他的女儿也当了电车司机，并被选为区人民代表。这位饱受风霜的老人对宪法草案有极深的感触，他表示：为了下一代的幸福，要把自己所有的力量贡献给伟大的社会主义建设事业。清河制呢厂整染车间女工李淑卿，解放前生过三次孩子，就被解雇失业三次。现在这个工厂成立了托儿所，女工生孩子不但可以休息，还照常领到工资。工人们纷纷表示以新的生产成就来庆祝宪法草案的公布。全国纺织工业劳动模范、清河制呢厂女工刘世梅领导的小组，提出保证完成小组全年增产六亿五千多万元的计划。京西城子矿潘玉通班听了宪法草案的报告后，生产情绪高涨，提前五天完成了六月份的生产任务。大家一致表示要尽公民应尽的义务，扩展人民革命胜利的成果。
