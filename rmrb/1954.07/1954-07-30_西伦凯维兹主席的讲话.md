    Chairman Cyrankiewicz's Speech
    Today, at the dawn of the day when our distinguished guest, Comrade Zhou Enlai, Premier of the People's Republic of China, speaks to us in Warsaw, the guns of North Vietnam are silent. Within days, the same will be true of other parts of Indochina. Peace will spread across a country that has suffered eight years of hardship under the horrors of war. We Poles understand what this means. War raged across our land for almost six years. The Nazi aggressors used every means of cruelty. The war waged by colonialists in Vietnam was cruel and terrifying. Who understands more profoundly than we do the joy felt by a country that has finally regained peace after eight years of bloody war?
    We are even more pleased to be able to host one of the architects of the peace that everyone craves – Premier Zhou Enlai, the head of the delegation of the People's Republic of China attending the Geneva Conference.
    For this reason, we welcome him even more warmly; because he is a messenger of peace, a representative of a country fighting for international justice, and a supporter of the great principle that no international dispute cannot be resolved through consultation. The powerful People's Republic of China, with a population of 600 million, standing shoulder to shoulder with its socialist motherland, the leader of the peace camp, the Soviet Union, has for many years advocated this principle and steadfastly fought for its application in international affairs.
    Thanks to these lofty efforts, the world has not suffered new, terrible flames of war. Because the dark forces of reaction, imperialism, aggression, and war have constantly attempted to ignite new flames of war in the hotbeds of every international conflict. In the past few years, we have seen these warmongering groups' bellicose schemes. In this situation, the flag of the United Nations—an organization established through the collective efforts of nations that once collectively defeated the aggressive forces of German Nazism, Italian Fascism, and Japanese imperialism—has been abused.
    In the past few years, we have twice seen these warmongering groups' bellicose attempts.
    The common victory of the peoples of various countries in defeating the violence of the three fascist countries gave rise to the idea of the United Nations. Now, this idea has been brutally trampled upon by American aggressors attempting to ignite a new war in the Far East.
    Today, all good people around the world, including the Polish people, are fully aware that, in order to restore the glory of the United Nations flag, to create conditions for the peaceful resolution of all international disputes, and to enhance the prestige of the United Nations, it is necessary to prevent the attempt by certain groups in the United States to abuse this organization, and it is necessary to respect the principle that the United Nations, as its name implies, is not a company monopolizing oil or fruit, but an organization in which continents and countries alike have the right to express their opinions on issues of greatest interest to humanity.
    Therefore, there is an increasingly widespread demand – which the Polish people wholeheartedly support – that the true, great People's China should obtain its legitimate place in the United Nations, replacing the heinous Chiang Kai-shek puppet stained with blood. Only those who are politically blind, only those who have lost their sense of political reality, can confuse the island of Taiwan, seized from the Chinese people by fraudulent means, with the vast Chinese mainland, and can confuse the remnants of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang with the 600 million Chinese people who are building a new life today.
    Less than a year ago, thanks to the joint efforts of the Soviet Union, People's China, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and thanks to the power of world public opinion, the imperialists had to accept the Korean armistice. Today, we are celebrating another glorious victory of the forces of peace, and the sinister conspiracy of American diplomats has gone bankrupt.
    After eighty days of intense work by the diplomats of the peace camp, and due to the great desire for peace on the part of France and the people of the world, the Geneva Conference reached an agreement on the peaceful settlement of the Indochina issue.
    This is a common victory for the Vietnamese people and the French people—who, for eight years, have been dragged into a war of cruel massacre. The French people—the people who stormed the Bastille, who carried out the French Revolution, the people who hope that France will maintain its glory—have long been weary of the "dirty" war in Vietnam.
    For the Vietnamese people, this is a sacred war of liberation, a war waged under the same slogan that once inspired French patriots to storm the Bastille.
    Therefore, this victory of the forces of peace is also a victory for the peoples of all countries today.
    In such days, we are greatly encouraged by the visit of a representative of such a great People's China.
    We all remember that those who attended the Unity Congress of the Polish Workers' Movement five years ago heard the happy news that the ancient Chinese capital of Beijing had been liberated by the Chinese People's Army. At that time, the Polish people celebrated both the unification of the working class and the victory of free China. Now, on the eve of the National Day of People's Poland—the tenth anniversary of the rebirth of People's Poland, which we celebrate with great joy—we have heard from Geneva the news of another Asian country, Vietnam, achieving victory over the forces of aggression, and our great National Day has become a double celebration. Because we live in such an era, we are a link in the strong chain of peace forces, a chain that today stretches from the Pacific to the Elbe, from the Indian Ocean to the Arctic Circle. Our strength lies not only in the fact that the countries of the peace, democracy, and socialism camp—the Soviet Union, People's China, People's Poland, the German Democratic Republic, and the people's democracies—have a combined population of one billion, but also in the fact that the slogan we proclaim is clear and understandable to all the people of the world, no matter where they live, no matter what their language, skin color, or religious beliefs. We declare that all countries, regardless of social and political systems, can coexist peacefully and engage in peaceful competition in the economic, social, and cultural fields. This slogan penetrates the masses of people in all countries, breaking through political boundaries and language barriers. It has a great role in uniting humanity. This role guarantees that our slogan will ultimately and certainly defeat those who hope to divide humanity according to wealth, skin color, language, nationality, or ethnicity, those who, in order to satisfy the interests of a handful of multi-billionaires, are provoking relations between countries and pushing the world once again into the abyss of war. Therefore, it is no wonder that the peace we regard with joy is a disaster for them. Spokesmen of imperialist policy weep for it, calling peace a setback, a failure, and destruction, because they have not been able to stir up war and expand war. But we, and the billions of people around the world who are with us, declare: despite all the difficulties, it is still possible to eliminate another hotbed of war that American diplomacy is frantically preparing. This contrast is far better than the empty and hypocritical words of some people, who are frantically building war bases in places far away from their own countries, piecing together war blocs, and intending to revive German and Japanese militarism at any cost. The Geneva Conference has opened the eyes of billions of people around the world.
    The Soviet Union, China, People's Poland, the German Democratic Republic, and the people's democracies are bringing peace to the world.
    The worshipers of atomic and hydrogen bombs are threatening the world with death and destruction.
    We are growing stronger and stronger. We can force those who are waging the Cold War and supporting aggression to accept the principle of consultation. This is a blessing for humanity, civilization, and humanity's long culture.
    In this regard, we must thank our neighbor, the fraternal people of the great Soviet Union. Due to the victory of the great October Socialist Revolution, carried out under the leadership of Lenin, the wise leader of all mankind, they have built an invincible fortress of peace and socialism in just a few decades, becoming the vanguard of all mankind and liberating enormous creative power. This creative power has today become the support and hope of all ordinary people in all continents of the world.
    We know that political adventurers have not given up. We know that, although their plot to launch a war in the Far East has failed, they are plotting in Europe again. The European Defense Community—the "European Army" treaty—is the catchphrase of aggressive forces on the European continent. They place their hopes on the revival of the Nazi Wehrmacht. For years, they have been trying to rearm the militarists of Western Europe, attempting to make Europe hear again the terrible sound of Prussian boots marching across the parade ground; this sound foreshadows a new eastward advance and a new Sedan.
    But we all remember, we remember Poland in September 1939. The peoples of the Soviet Union all remember June 1941. The people of Belgium, France, and the Netherlands all remember April and May 1940. We must not allow the tragedies of those years to be repeated.
    Today, we are incomparably stronger. It is clear that every act of aggression by the imperialists will inevitably end in the final defeat of the aggressors.
    But that's not the point. The point is to prevent such a possibility from existing. Therefore, we must do everything possible to guarantee the security of Europe, which means preventing Germany from re-militarizing.
    Our great ally and leader in the struggle for peace, the Soviet Union, which has always been the first to put forward peace initiatives and express concern for the security, sovereignty, integrity, and independence of all countries, has put forward a historic proposal for the establishment of a European collective security system. We Poles, although we have not yet completely removed the traces of destruction from our country despite the astonishing efforts of the entire people, are striving to eliminate the war wounds of our capital. We deeply understand the importance and significance of this initiative.
    We enthusiastically respond to this proposal. The Polish government, supported by the united Polish people, welcomes the Soviet government's proposal for a European collective security system and will do everything in its power to contribute to the realization of this plan.
    The Polish government is pleased to welcome the speech of Comrade Zhou Enlai, Premier of the People's Republic of China, in which he said, "The Chinese government and people warmly support these peaceful efforts of the Polish government and people. The strengthening of friendly cooperation between China and Poland will further strengthen the world peace forces led by the Soviet Union and further consolidate peace and security in Asia and Europe."
    Six hundred million Chinese people are making a great contribution to the struggle for peace and security in Europe. Because peace is indeed indivisible, and it is precisely for this reason that we must work together to extinguish all flames of war ignited by the imperialists anywhere. The great solidarity of the peace camp and the powerful world peace movement shows the desire of all of us—the people of the Vistula, the Elbe, the Moscow River, the Yangtze River, as well as the people of the Thames, the Seine, the Rhine, the Tiber, and the Ganges—to protect humanity from the danger of atomic and hydrogen bomb wars that would destroy all the achievements of our civilization. In this struggle, we will spare no effort, and we will work with billions of people to make the greatest effort so that the people of all countries can devote themselves to their creative work in an environment of peace and security, in order to increase material and cultural happiness.
    In this hall, there are Polish workers, peasants, and intellectuals, who are people engaged in creative work, who are representatives of the national people. In work and in the struggle for the national people's security and a bright and just future, they are united with the representatives of the great Chinese people who are so geographically distant. We are separated by thousands of kilometers, our traditions and history are different, and we speak different languages. However, our hearts are close, we understand each other, because a common cause and a common struggle connect us. Our victory is the victory of the Chinese people, and our victory and the victory of the Chinese people are the victory of all peace-loving humanity. Therefore, the Polish people are so happy to welcome the representatives of the People's Republic of China.
    We have ties of unbreakable friendship with the Soviet people, we have received the warm, generous, and fraternal assistance of the Soviet Union in difficult times, and we are engaged in friendly cooperation with the people's democracies. At this moment of friendly visit, we feel more strongly than ever how our ally, the great Chinese people, are extending a fraternal hand to us in the common struggle for the security, peace, and happiness of our two peoples.
    Long live the world's peace forces under the leadership of the Soviet Union!
    Long live the People's Republic of China!
    Long live Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people!
    Long live Sino-Polish friendship, and may Sino-Polish friendship be increasingly consolidated!
    Long live peace and the friendship of all peoples!

    西伦凯维兹主席的讲话
    今天，在我们的贵宾——中华人民共和国总理周恩来同志在华沙向我们讲话的这一天的黎明，北越的炮声沉寂了。在几天之内，印度支那的其他部分也将有同样的情况。和平将遍及一个在战争的恐怖下遭受了八年苦难的国家。我们波兰人是了解它的意义的。战争差不多在我们国土上进行了六年。纳粹侵略者使用了一切残酷的手段。殖民主义者在越南进行的战争是残酷的、恐怖的。有谁比我们更深刻地了解到一个在八年的流血战争后终于恢复了和平的国家所感到的高兴呢？
    我们更高兴的是，我们能够招待人人渴望的和平的建筑师之一——出席日内瓦会议的中华人民共和国代表团首席代表周恩来总理。
    为了这个原因，我们更热烈地欢迎他；因为他是和平的使者，是一个为国际正义而斗争的国家的代表，是支持没有国际争端不能通过协商解决这个伟大原则的人。和社会主义祖国、和平阵营的领导者苏联并肩作战的、拥有六亿人口的强大的中华人民共和国，多年来一直主张这个原则并坚持不渝地为在国际事务中应用这个原则而斗争。
    由于这些崇高的努力，全世界才没有经受新的可怕的战火。因为反动、帝国主义、侵略和战争的黑暗势力一直在不断地企图在每一个国际冲突的温床燃起新的战火。在过去几年中，我们已经看到了战争贩子集团的这种好战图谋。在这种情况下，联合国——一个由从前曾以集体努力打垮了德国纳粹主义、意大利法西斯主义和日本帝国主义的侵略军的国家的集体努力建立起来的组织——的旗帜被滥用了。
    在过去几年中，我们两次看到了战争贩子集团的这种好战的尝试。
    各国人民打败三个法西斯国家的暴力而取得的共同胜利产生了联合国的思想，现在，这种思想受到了企图在远东燃起新战火的美国侵略者的野蛮的践踏。
    今天，全世界善良的人民，包括波兰人民在内，都充分意识到，为了恢复联合国旗帜的光荣，为了给和平解决一切国际纠纷创造条件，为了提高联合国的威望，必须防止美国某些集团滥用这个组织的企图，必须尊重这样一个原则，即联合国顾名思义不是一个垄断石油或水果的公司，而是这样一个组织，在这个组织中，各洲、各国都同样有权对与人类有最大利害关系的问题表示意见。
    因此，有一种要求愈来愈成为普遍的要求了——波兰人民全心全意地支持它，这种要求就是：真正的、伟大的人民中国应该取得它在联合国中的合法地位，代替染满鲜血的万恶的蒋介石傀儡。只有政治上盲目的人、只有失去了政治现实感的人们，才能把用欺诈手段从中国人手里夺去的台湾岛和广大的中国大陆混为一谈，才能把蒋介石残匪和今天正在建设新生活的六亿中国人民混为一谈。
    不到一年前，由于苏联、人民中国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的共同努力，由于世界舆论的力量，帝国主义者不得不接受了朝鲜停战。今天，我们又在庆祝和平力量的又一次辉煌的胜利，美国外交官的险恶阴谋破产了。
    经过和平阵营的外交家们八十天的紧张工作，同时由于法国及全世界人民的要求和平的伟大愿望，日内瓦会议才就和平解决印度支那问题达成了协议。
    这是越南人民和法国人民——八年以来，他们被拖入一场残酷屠杀的战争中——的共同胜利。法国人民——攻破巴士底狱、进行过法国大革命的人民，希望法国保持光荣的人民长期以来就厌倦了越南的“肮脏”战争。
    对越南人民来说，这是一个神圣的解放战争，是在曾经鼓舞法国爱国志士攻破巴士底狱的同样口号下进行的战争。
    因此，和平力量的这个胜利今天同时也就是各国人民的胜利。
    在这种日子里，有这样一位伟大的人民中国的代表到我们这里来访问，使我们十分欢欣鼓舞。
    我们都还记得，五年前参加波兰工人运动统一代表大会的人们听到了一个令人高兴的消息，中国古都北京为中国人民的军队所解放，当时波兰人民又庆祝工人阶级的统一，又庆祝自由中国的胜利。现在，在人民波兰的国庆节——我们欢欣鼓舞庆祝的人民波兰国家复兴节十周年——的前夕，我们又从日内瓦听到了另一个亚洲国家越南对侵略势力取得了胜利的消息，我们的伟大的国庆节又成了一个双重庆祝的节日。由于我们生存在这样一个时代，所以我们是和平力量的强大链条中的一个环节，这个链条今天从太平洋伸展到易北河，从印度洋伸展到北极圈。我们的力量不仅在于和平、民主和社会主义阵营各国——苏联、人民中国、人民波兰、德意志民主共和国和各人民民主国家——共有十亿人民，而且在于我们宣布的口号对于全世界所有的人民都是明白易晓的，不管他们居住在什么地方，不管他们的语言、肤色、宗教信仰如何。我们宣布，所有的国家，不论社会制度和政治制度如何，都能和平共处，都能在经济、社会和文化方面和平竞赛。这个口号深入世界各国广大群众，打破了政治界限和语言障碍。它有团结人类的伟大作用。这种作用保证了我们的口号最后终能肯定地战胜希望按照财富、肤色、语言、民族或种族来划分人类的人们，这些人为了满足一小撮亿万豪富的利益，正在挑拨各国关系，把世界再度推向战争的深渊。因此，无怪乎我们怀着欢欣的心情来看待的和平，对他们说来却是灾难，帝国主义政策代言人要为之痛哭，他们把和平称做是挫折、失败和毁灭，因为他们没有能够煽起战争和扩大战争。但是我们以及和我们在一起的全世界亿万人民声言：尽管有种种困难，仍有可能消除美国外交所狂热地准备的又一个战争温床。这个对比远胜某些人们成千上万句的空洞虚伪的话，这些人们正在远离他们国家的地方狂热地建立战争基地，拼凑战争集团，不惜任何代价打算复活德、日军国主义。日内瓦会议为全世界亿万老百姓打开了眼睛。
    苏联、中国、人民波兰、德意志民主共和国和各人民民主国家正在为全世界带来和平。
    原子弹和氢弹的崇拜者正在以死亡和毁灭来威胁全世界。
    我们愈来愈强大，我们能够迫使那些进行冷战和支持侵略的人们接受协商的原则，这是人类、文明和人类悠久文化的幸事。
    关于这一点，我们不得不感谢我们的邻国，伟大苏联的兄弟人民。由于在全人类的英明领袖列宁的领导下进行的伟大的十月社会主义革命的胜利，他们在短短的几十年内建立了一个不可战胜的和平和社会主义的堡垒，成了全人类的先锋队，解放了巨大的创造力，这种创造力今天已成为世界各洲一切普通人民的支持和希望。
    我们知道，政治冒险家们并没有断念。我们知道，虽然他们在远东发动战争的阴谋破产了，他们又在欧洲实行阴谋。欧洲防务集团——“欧洲军”条约——是欧洲大陆上的侵略势力的口头禅。他们把希望寄托在纳粹国防军的复活上。几年以来，他们一直在竭力重新武装西欧的军国主义者，企图使欧洲再度听到普鲁士式靴走过阅兵场的可怖的声音；这种声音预兆着新的东进和新的塞当。
    但是我们都记得，我们记得波兰的一九三九年九月。苏联各族人民都记得一九四一年六月。比利时、法国和荷兰人民都记得一九四○年四月和五月。我们决不能让这些年代的悲剧重演。
    今天，我们无比地强大了。很明显，帝国主义者的每一个侵略行动都不可避免地要以侵略者的最后失败而告终。
    但是，问题不在这里。问题是防止这样一个可能性的存在。因此，我们必须尽一切力量来保障欧洲的安全，这就是说，防止德国重新军国主义化。
    我们在争取和平的斗争中的伟大的盟友和领导者苏联，一贯是最先提出和平倡议并对各国的安全、主权完整和独立表示关怀的，它提出了关于建立一个欧洲集体安全体系的历史性建议。我们波兰人，虽然经过全体人民惊人的努力，还没有把破坏的痕迹从我们国土上全部去掉，正努力消除我们首都的战争创伤，我们对这种倡议的重要性和意义是深切了解的。
    我们热烈地响应这个建议。得到团结一致的全体波兰人民的支持的波兰政府，欢迎苏联政府关于欧洲集体安全体系的建议，并将尽它的一切力量来对这个计划的实现作出贡献。
    波兰政府高兴地欢迎中华人民共和国总理周恩来同志的谈话，他在谈话中说，“中国政府和人民热烈支持波兰政府和人民的这些和平努力。中、波两国友好合作的加强必将更加壮大以苏联为首的世界和平力量，并进一步巩固亚洲和欧洲的和平与安全。”
    六亿中国人民正在对争取欧洲和平与安全的斗争作出伟大的贡献。因为和平事实上是不可分割的，正因为如此，必须共同努力来扑灭帝国主义者在任何地方燃起的一切战火。和平阵营和声势浩大的世界和平运动的大团结，表明了我们所有的人——维斯杜拉河、易比河、莫斯科河、长江的人民，以及泰晤士河、塞纳河、莱因河、台伯河和恒河的人民——的保卫人类不受将使我们文明的一切成就毁灭的原子战争和氢弹战争的危险的愿望。在这个斗争中，我们将不遗余力，我们将和亿万人民共同尽最大的努力来使各国人民得以在和平和安全的环境中致力于他们的创造性工作，以增进物质和文化幸福。
    在这个大厅里，出席的有波兰工人、农民和知识分子，他们是从事创造性工作的人们，是全国人民的代表人物，他们在工作中和在为全国人民的安全和美好的公正的未来的斗争中，是同在地域上如此辽远的伟大中国人民的代表团结在一起的。我们相隔数千公里，我们的传统和历史不同，我们说着不同的语言。但是，我们的心是亲近的，我们是彼此了解的，因为共同的事业和共同的斗争把我们联系了起来。我们的胜利就是中国人民的胜利，我们的胜利和中国人民的胜利就是所有爱好和平人类的胜利。因此波兰全国人民这样高兴地欢迎中华人民共和国的代表们。
    我们和苏联人民有着牢不可破的友谊的联系，我们在困难的时候曾得到苏联的热情的、慷慨的和兄弟般的援助，我们和人民民主国家进行着友好的合作，在这个友好访问的时刻，我们比任何时候都更加强烈地感到我们的盟友、伟大的中国人民如何在争取我们两国人民的安全、和平和幸福的共同斗争中向我们伸出兄弟的手。
    在苏联领导下的全世界和平力量万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    中国人民伟大的领袖毛泽东万岁！
    波中友谊万岁，祝波中友谊日益巩固！
    和平和各国人民友谊万岁！
