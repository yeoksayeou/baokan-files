    Enhance Artistic Cultivation and Strive for Artistic Practice
    Music Performances Become Active
    In order to strengthen the artistic practice of musicians and enliven the cultural life of the masses, the Chinese Musicians Association has planned and organized a series of internal observation performances of various natures and public concerts in which professional performing groups, amateur music groups, and musicians from Beijing participate. Two public concerts held separately by famous vocalists and performers such as Yu Yixuan, Zhang Quan, Zhou Guangren, Yang Bingsun, and Lou Gangui were welcomed by the audience in the capital. At the observation session performed by Medvedev, the consultant of the Central Conservatory of Music and a Soviet vocal expert, and his students, Medvedev's outstanding singing was repeatedly warmly welcomed by the audience. After several months of teaching, his students showed certain artistic talents at this concert. Other concerts were also very rich and wonderful.
    The Shanghai Orchestra held a four-day summer concert in June, with a total audience of more than 70,000 people. Among them, the majority were workers. The concert was performed by the orchestra's symphony orchestra, chorus, national orchestra, and brass band. The repertoire of performances and singing was rich and diverse, including the new orchestral work "Carriage" by Chinese composer Ge Yan, the second movement of "New World Symphony" by outstanding Czech composer Dvořák, the famous Soviet composer Shostakovich's famous cantata "Song of the Forests," Lu Chunling's flute solo "Little Shepherd Boy" and folk orchestral music "Grand Gathering," the brass band's performance of "Poet and Peasant," and chorus and solo "Salute to Beijing," "The Sun Never Sets on the Grassland," "Ode to the Yellow River," and so on. In order to further connect with the audience and extensively absorb opinions, the troupe also held a "Audience and Actors Gala."
    The Southwest Music Workers Association also held vocal concerts by vocalist Lang Yuxiu and violinist Hu Jingxiang in mid-June. The program of this joint concert included modern creations, excellent folk songs, and classical music from China, the Soviet Union, North Korea, and the West.
    East China to Hold Drama and Opera Observation Performances
    The Cultural Bureau of the East China Administrative Council has decided to hold the East China Drama Observation Performance and the East China Opera Observation Performance Conference in Shanghai in September and October this year. The purpose of the observation performance is to check the situation of drama and opera reform work in the region, as well as to observe and learn from each other, and promote the development of the East China drama movement and the reform of opera art.
    The organizing committee of the performance conference consists of 18 people including Xia Yan, Liu Xuewei, and Zhou Xinfang. Xia Yan is the chairman. The organizing committee has held meetings to discuss and determine the requirements for the selection of troupes and repertoires to participate in the drama and opera observation performances, the schedule and working institutions. The organizing committee meeting also believes that the preparation work of each province (city) is the foundation of the entire drama and opera observation performance work; therefore, it requires each province (city) to quickly establish a preparatory organization, carefully make a comprehensive work deployment, and start work as soon as possible; and to be universal and in-depth in the selection of repertoires. The meeting stipulated that the drama observation performance will begin in early September and end in mid-September; the opera observation performance will begin in late September and end in late October.
    In order to welcome the East China Drama and Opera Observation Performances, the cultural affairs bureaus of all provinces in East China have begun intense preparations.
    Recommend New Songs to the Masses
    In order to recommend the creation of songs in the Southwest region to the masses, and encourage music creation through mass trial singing, the Chongqing Municipal People's Government Cultural Bureau held a "New Song Concert" at the Chongqing Municipal Labor People's Cultural Palace on June 20. Participating units included 20 mass amateur singing teams from factories, government agencies, schools, and cultural centers in Chongqing, with a total of more than 1,200 participants.
    Among the songs sung, there were 41 songs created in the Southwest region in recent years, some of which were amateur creations, and 18 songs from outside the region and the Soviet Union. Some of the better songs, such as "Flowers Dedicated to the People's Liberation Army" (lyrics by Lü Zifang, music by He Fenglin), "A Better Life in the Future" (lyrics by Zhang Zhiyuan, music by Qiu Banshu), "Glorious Medal" (lyrics by Guan Zhongmin, music by Jin Sha), "Song of Young Builders" (lyrics by Liu Binyan, music by Yang Mingliang), etc., were welcomed by the masses. The Soviet and North Korean songs sung at the meeting, such as "The Sun Sets" and "Song of Spring," also played a role in improving the masses' ability to appreciate music.
    Representatives of the units participating in the concert also held a forum. Participants requested lyricists and composers to write songs that could express the thoughts and feelings of advanced figures in society. Zhang Jinlan, a Young Pioneer from Shenxiandong Primary School, asked lyricists and composers to write more songs for children, and not to let children sing adult songs all the time. Many professional music workers talked about: to write an excellent song, it is necessary to rely on the masses, and test and pass it in the masses. Only with the help of the masses can we write songs that are truly suitable for the masses to sing. All performing units requested the Chongqing Municipal Cultural Bureau and professional art groups to strengthen the guidance of mass music activities, and cultivate the backbone of mass song creation, conducting, and singing.
    Participants also put forward opinions on the creation, emotional processing, conducting, accompaniment, clothing, makeup, etc. of the songs performed, as well as the organization of the concert.
    Training Staff and Workers in Amateur Creation
    The Propaganda Department of the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, together with the Propaganda Department of the Provincial Federation of Trade Unions and the Provincial and Municipal Federation of Literary and Art Circles, held the first phase of the provincial staff and workers' amateur literary and artistic creation training class. More than 30 people, including grassroots trade union cultural and educational workers and workshop workers from 33 units such as factories and mines, participated in the training class. In addition to focusing on political study, they also studied the relevant documents of the Second Congress of Chinese Literary and Art Workers, attended eight professional courses, and talked about "The Relationship between the Author's Policy Study and Creation" and "Talking about Writing Scripts," "Talking about Writing Drum Lyrics and Errenzhuan" and other issues. They also carried out creation practice in the last 17 days. During the creation practice stage, the students wrote a total of 38 works, including 14 small dramas, one one-act comedy, five operas, two Ping operas, one clapper talk play, and 15 Shandong Kuaishu, Errenzhuan, Henan Zhuizi, etc. Among them, such as the drama "Holiday", "Master Zhang", the opera "Take Care of Your Own Business", and Errenzhuan "One Hundred and Twenty Bags of Cement" are all relatively good works. In addition to some of these works being published in "Heilongjiang Literature and Art", the rest will be compiled and printed into "Collection of Workers' Literary and Artistic Creation Training Class" for basic construction sites, factories, and mine amateur troupes as propaganda materials.

    音乐演出活跃起来了
    中国音乐家协会为了加强音乐家的艺术实践，和活跃群众的文化生活，今年有计划地组织了一系列的、包括各种性质的内部观摩演出和公开的由北京市各专业演出团体、业余音乐团体和音乐家参加的音乐会。由喻宜萱、张权、周广仁、杨秉荪、楼干贵等著名声乐家、演奏家分别举行的两个公开的音乐会，受到首都听众的欢迎。在中央音乐学院顾问、苏联声乐专家梅德维捷夫和他的学生表演的观摩会上，梅德维捷夫卓越的演唱，一再受到听众的热烈欢迎。他的学生经过几个月的教导，在这次音乐会上都表现了一定的艺术才能。其他的一些音乐会也是非常丰富精彩。
    上海乐团在六月间举行了四天夏季音乐会，共有听众七万多人。其中以工人群众占大多数。音乐会由该团的交响乐队、合唱队、民族乐队和铜管乐队担任演出。演奏和演唱的节目丰富多样，有我国作曲家葛炎的管弦乐新作“马车”、捷克斯洛伐克杰出作曲家德沃夏克的“新世界交响乐”第二乐章、苏联作曲家萧斯塔柯维奇的著名清唱剧“森林之歌”、陆春龄的笛子独奏“小放牛”和民间管弦乐曲“大联欢”、铜管乐队演奏的“诗人与农夫”以及合唱、独唱“向北京致敬”“草原上升起不落的太阳”“黄河颂”等。该团为了进一步联系听众，广泛吸收意见，并举行了“听众演员联欢晚会”。
    西南音乐工作者协会在六月中旬，也举办了声乐家郎毓秀及小提琴家胡静翔的演唱、演奏会。这个联合音乐会的节目包括中国、苏联、朝鲜及西洋的现代创作作品、优秀民歌、古典乐曲等。
    华东区将举行话剧、戏曲观摩会演
    华东行政委员会文化局决定在今年九、十月间在上海举办华东区话剧观摩演出和华东区戏曲观摩演出大会。观摩演出的目的，是检查该地区话剧和戏曲改革工作的情况，以及相互观摩学习，促进华东话剧运动的开展与戏曲艺术的改革。
    演出大会筹备委员会由夏衍、刘雪苇、周信芳等十八人组成。夏衍为主任委员。筹备委员会已举行了会议，讨论和确定了对参加活剧、戏曲观摩演出的剧团、剧目选拔的要求，日程和工作机构。筹备委员会会议并认为：各省（市）的准备工作是整个话剧、戏曲观摩演出工作的基础；因此，要求各省（市）迅速成立筹备机构，缜密地作出全面工作部署，尽快地展开工作；在选拔剧目上做到普遍深入。会议规定：话剧观摩演出于九月初开始，九月中旬结束；戏曲观摩演出于九月下旬开始，十月下旬结束。
    为了迎接华东区话剧、戏曲观摩演出，华东各省文化事业管理局都已开始了紧张的筹备工作。
    向群众推荐新歌曲
    重庆市人民政府文化局为了向群众推荐西南区的歌曲创作，通过群众试唱，来鼓励音乐创作，于六月二十日在重庆市劳动人民文化宫举办了“新歌演唱会”。参加的单位有重庆市的工厂、机关、学校、文化馆等二十个群众业余歌詠队共一千二百余人参加了表演。
    在演唱的歌曲中属西南区近年创作的有四十一首，其中有部分系业余创作，外区及苏联歌曲十八首。一些较好的歌曲如“鲜花献给解放军”（吕子房词，何枫林曲）、“以后的生活更美好”（张志远词，裘班书曲）、“光荣的勋章”（关仲敏词，金砂曲）、“青年建设者之歌”（刘宾雁词，杨明良曲）等都受到群众的欢迎。会上演唱的苏联、朝鲜的歌曲如“太阳落山”、“春之歌”等对提高群众音乐欣赏能力也起到一定的作用。
    参加演唱会各单位代表并举行了座谈会，与会者要求作词家、作曲家写出足以表现社会中先进人物的思想感情的歌曲。神仙洞小学少先队员张金兰要求作词家、作曲家为少年儿童多写一些歌曲，不要让儿童们尽唱成年人的曲子。很多专业音乐工作者谈到：写成一首优秀的歌曲，必须依靠群众，在群众中考验、通过，只有在群众的帮助之下，才可能写出真正适合群众演唱的歌曲。各演唱单位要求重庆市文化局与各专业艺术团体加强对群众音乐活动的辅导，培养群众的歌曲创作与指挥、演唱的骨干。
    与会者对演唱的歌曲在创作上、情绪处理上，指挥、伴奏、服装、化装等方面，以及演唱会的组织工作也提出了意见。
