The All-China Federation of Cooperatives convened the Third National Handicraft Production Cooperation Conference from November 20 to December 17, 1953. Participants included directors of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives offices in major regions, heads of production departments of provincial and municipal cooperatives, representatives from some provincial and municipal supply and marketing cooperatives, consumer cooperatives, federations of production cooperatives, and directors of several grassroots cooperatives, as well as representatives from relevant central departments.

The main issues discussed at the conference were:

I. Handicraft production occupies a very important position in China's national economy. Due to the insufficiency of modern industrial products, handicrafts are an important economic force supplying the production and living materials needed by urban and rural people. Currently, in the industries of major and medium-sized cities in China, handicrafts still account for a certain proportion; the industries in small cities are almost entirely handicrafts. According to preliminary calculations based on practical work in various fields, there are more than 19.3 million urban and rural handicraft workers and independent handicraft laborers in the country (after several years of development, this may now exceed 20 million); the output value of individual handicrafts and workshop handicrafts reaches 100 trillion yuan (excluding household and farmers' handicraft side businesses). The important role of handicrafts in the overall national economic life is manifested in: (1) Supplying the vast number of farmers with the production and living materials they need. Handicraft products generally account for 60 to 70 percent of the industrial products needed by farmers, and in some cases even 80 percent. Before China achieves industrialization and agriculture obtains modern machinery equipment, handicrafts play a significant role in the repair and manufacture of agricultural tools, contributing to the development of agricultural production. (2) Engaging in the processing of agricultural and industrial products and providing services for the parts repair and small-scale manufacturing of large state-owned industries. (3) Cultivating technical workers for the country during the process of realizing socialist industrialization, serving as an important source of technical reserves for state-owned industries. (4) In supplying the daily necessities needed by urban residents, handicraft products account for a considerable proportion; the manual repair industry serving the lives of urban and rural residents also has its special role. (5) Manufacturing various arts and crafts for supply to domestic and international markets. (6) Maintaining and developing handicrafts is currently an important aspect of employment for urban and rural people. Therefore, although a small portion of China's handicrafts has been replaced by modern industry or eliminated in the process of economic restructuring, a large portion still has its value and room for development, and even after the realization of socialist industrialization, handicrafts will continue to be a regular assistant to machine industry for a long period of time. The view of negating the role of handicrafts is incorrect.

However, on the other hand, it must be recognized that most of China's handicrafts are currently individual, small private handicraft independent laborers, whose production is decentralized, backward, blind, and conservative. This individual, private ownership-based production relationship restricts the development of handicraft productivity and the adoption of new technologies, cannot overcome difficulties in production and product sales, cannot avoid the control and exploitation of commercial capital and usury, and cannot adapt to the planned requirements of national economic construction and the growing material and cultural needs of the people. At the same time, individual handicraft workers, as small private owners and small commodity sellers, constantly breed spontaneous capitalist tendencies. If left to their own devices, they cannot avoid the painful capitalist path of a few people getting rich and the majority becoming poor and bankrupt. However, individual handicraft workers are also laborers who rely on their own labor rather than exploiting others for a living, which determines that they can gradually move towards socialism under the leadership of the working class. Therefore, realizing the socialist transformation of handicrafts is an indispensable component of the Party's general task in the transition period. It is necessary to lead and educate handicraft producers to gradually change the existing production relations in handicrafts through the path of cooperation, gradually change the private ownership of the means of production of individual handicraft workers into collective ownership, gradually change the decentralized individual small production into collective production, carry out some technical reforms, promote the development of their productive forces, to meet the growing needs of the country and the people, and gradually realize the mechanization or semi-mechanization of handicraft production along with the state's economic development. Cooperation is the only correct and necessary path to gradually implement the socialist transformation of handicrafts, guide handicraft workers to gradually transition to socialism, and gradually move towards mechanization.

II. Since the victory of the New Democratic Revolution across the country more than four years ago, the urban and rural handicraft cooperation movement has seen great development. According to statistics at the end of 1953, there were 4,806 handicraft production cooperatives with 300,000 members, and the total annual production value reached 5.2 trillion yuan. In 1954, it is planned to develop over 900,000 handicraft laborers participating in various forms of handicraft cooperative organizations, and the total product value will increase to over 10 trillion yuan. During the period of the First Five-Year Plan, a solid foundation must be laid for the handicraft cooperation movement. By 1957, the membership of various handicraft cooperative organizations is planned to develop to 5 million people, with a total production value of over 60 trillion yuan. It is expected that by the middle of the Second Five-Year Plan, the organizational task of handicraft cooperation will be basically completed nationwide, and further efforts will be made to improve the political and ideological awareness and production technology of handicraft production cooperatives to meet the requirements of national socialist industrialization.

The handicraft production organizations that have been organized have all demonstrated their superiority to varying degrees. This superiority is manifested in:

(1) Because of being organized, it is first possible to overcome the serious difficulties that individual handicraft workers faced in the past in terms of raw material supply and product sales, thereby changing the phenomenon of work stoppage in the off-season and stockouts in the peak season, and enabling continuous production throughout the year.

(2) Because of being organized and implementing division of labor and cooperation in production, it is possible to gradually improve backward production technology, increase labor productivity, standardize product specifications, increase output, improve quality, and reduce costs. This is not only beneficial to farmers and urban consumers, but also the income of handicraft production cooperative members will increase accordingly, and their material and cultural lives will also be improved. At the same time, it can gradually increase public accumulation and prepare the material basis for further improving technical equipment and working conditions.

(3) Because of being organized, it is more convenient for handicraft production to establish regular connections with state-owned enterprises and supply and marketing cooperatives, thereby enhancing the planning of handicraft production, making it easier to bring handicraft production into the orbit of the national planned economy, and obtaining support and assistance from state-owned enterprises and supply and marketing cooperatives, freeing themselves from the exploitation and control of commercial capital and usury.

(4) Because of being organized, it is more convenient to sign binding contracts with supply and marketing cooperatives or directly with agricultural production mutual aid and cooperative organizations, so that the specifications and quality of their products are more suitable for the production and consumption needs of farmers, which not only opens up sales channels for their products but also helps promote agricultural production development and consolidate the worker-peasant alliance.

(5) Many handicraft production cooperatives have realized the collective ownership of the means of production by the members and the complete distribution of production income according to labor. Some other cooperatives also have some public accumulation and implement partial income distribution according to labor. This greatly increases the labor enthusiasm of the members, breaks the conservatism of technology, and is more conducive to the development of production.

(6) Handicraft production organizations conduct collectivist education and socialist education closely integrated with practice for handicraft laborers through production activities and cooperative affairs activities, thus making themselves socialist schools for handicraft laborers.

In old China and capitalist society, poverty and bankruptcy were the inevitable fate of handicraft laborers. Under the leadership and assistance of the Communist Party of China and the People's Government, handicraft laborers in New China will gradually transition to a socialist society of common prosperity through the path of cooperation.

III. Under the illumination of the state's general task in the transition period, the enthusiasm of handicraft workers for organizing is even higher, and the state's need for increased handicraft production is even more urgent. Party committees, people's governments, and leading organs of handicraft production at all levels must fully estimate this enthusiasm of the masses and the needs of the country, formulate appropriate development plans for handicraft cooperation based on the characteristics of handicrafts and the needs and possible conditions of various industries in the region, combined with supply, production, and sales. It is required that Party committees and people's governments at all levels follow the policy of active leadership and steady progress, first focusing on cities and market towns where handicrafts are relatively concentrated, and organize handicraft laborers according to the principle of voluntariness of the masses, that is, according to the level of awareness of the masses at that time and place, adopting diverse transitional forms suitable for the characteristics of handicrafts, and gradually developing to the advanced form of handicraft production cooperatives with completely socialist nature. A portion of small handicraft workers, who bear the main labor, master the main technology, and employ several assistants and apprentices of a supplementary nature, should still be allowed to participate in handicraft production organizations. However, handicraft capitalists should not be absorbed.

Based on the experience of the past four years, the following three forms are appropriate for organizing handicraft cooperation:

(1) Handicraft production teams are a low-level form of widely organizing handicraft laborers and also the easiest organizational form for handicraft laborers to accept. It first organizes handicraft laborers from the supply and sales aspects, organizes them to purchase raw materials from supply and marketing cooperatives, consumer cooperatives, or state-owned enterprises, sell finished products, or process for supply and marketing cooperatives, consumer cooperatives, and state-owned enterprises. This form not only prevents handicraft laborers from being controlled and exploited by commercial capital but also facilitates further transformation of handicrafts. Currently, there are many such types of handicraft production teams in various industries in various places, which are mainly organized by supply and marketing cooperatives and consumer cooperatives. In the future, this type of organization should be developed in a more planned way, and the original production teams should be rectified; it is necessary to cherish it, cultivate it, help it gradually improve in terms of labor organization, production technology, and product specifications, and continuously improve it, and gradually transition to handicraft production cooperatives.

In addition, there are some handicraft production teams that have implemented tool ownership by shares or public ownership of tools, centralized production, common labor, and complete distribution of income according to labor or partial distribution according to labor. This type of team only uses the name of a team due to the small number of members, but it is actually a relatively small-scale handicraft production cooperative.

(2) Handicraft supply and marketing production cooperatives are organized by several individual handicraft laborers or several handicraft production teams to solve the common difficulties of raw material procurement and product sales. The main activity of this type of handicraft supply and marketing production cooperative is to uniformly purchase raw materials from supply and marketing cooperatives, consumer cooperatives, or state-owned enterprises, sell finished products, and uniformly contract processing orders from supply and marketing cooperatives, consumer cooperatives, or state-owned enterprises. The advantage of this organizational form is that it can more effectively overcome the difficulties of small producers, and it is easier to help production teams and members gradually change production relations, gradually overcome the patriarchal system and improve the relationship between masters and apprentices, and gradually replace the relationship between employers and employees with a relationship of mutual assistance and cooperation among laborers. At the same time, handicraft supply and marketing production cooperatives may also use the accumulation in their own business operations to purchase public means of production, carry out partial centralized production, and gradually increase socialist factors to prepare conditions for a steady increase to handicraft production cooperatives. Since handicraft supply and marketing production cooperatives and production teams are mainly organized in terms of supply and sales, they cannot avoid the occurrence of bad phenomena such as going in the off-season, leaving in the peak season, cutting corners, and producing shoddy products. This is a capitalist tendency that may arise after small producers overcome difficulties, and attention must be paid to education and prevention. The way to prevent it is to further organize from the production side and raise it to handicraft production cooperatives. However, due to the limitations of decentralized production methods and technical conditions in certain industries, the forms of production teams and supply and marketing production cooperatives may be maintained for a longer period; there is no need to force centralized production to avoid wasting labor and causing unreasonable phenomena.

(3) Handicraft production cooperatives are an advanced form of socialist transformation of handicrafts. Among the existing more than 4,000 handicraft production cooperatives, the main means of production of a part of the cooperatives are completely collectively owned by the members, and the distribution according to labor is fully implemented, which is already a completely socialist production cooperative. The main means of production of a large part of the cooperatives have not yet become completely collectively owned, implementing tool ownership by shares and dividends, unified operation, and a portion of the income is distributed according to labor, which is a semi-socialist production cooperative.

IV. In order to implement the general line and realize the socialist transformation of handicrafts, it is necessary to adopt organizational forms that can be accepted by the masses, based on the specific conditions of local handicrafts, the needs of production development, and the degree of awareness of the handicraft laboring masses, and organize them voluntarily by the masses; it is necessary to adhere to the policy of active leadership and steady progress, and oppose both excessive demands, over-eagerness, greed for large scale and quantity, blind development, and laissez-faire and stagnation. Handicraft production cooperatives are currently in the initial stage of development, and it is necessary to cultivate typical examples and set good examples, which is of great significance for promoting handicraft laborers to take the path of cooperation.

To run handicraft production cooperatives well, the following principles must be followed:

(1) Adhere to the principle of using local materials, manufacturing locally, and supplying locally, select industries with development prospects in the local area to build cooperatives, and strengthen the planning of production so that production cooperatives have raw materials, sales channels, and can be consolidated and developed.

(2) Adhere to the principle of voluntary mutual benefit, prevent coercion and commandism, and promote democracy within the cooperative. Issues such as cash investment, tool investment pricing, wage system, labor dividend system, and share dividend must be democratically discussed by the members to seek reasonable solutions to ensure that all members can obtain the reasonable benefits they deserve.

(3) Handicraft production technology is very important. China's handicrafts have advanced technology, especially China's special handicrafts, which are exquisite and beautiful, and have superb skills, fully demonstrating the wisdom and creativity of the Chinese working people. Such as ivory carving, stone carving, lacquerware, cloisonné, Xiang embroidery, Yantai lace, and Jingdezhen porcelain, etc., have all become famous abroad. In order to preserve and carry forward the tradition of China's national art, it is necessary to seriously organize young apprentices to learn from old folk artists with advanced skills. Otherwise, some special handicrafts, if not given special care and allowed to decline, will lead to "the death of people and the extinction of art, and the loss of unique skills." During the most difficult years of the Great Patriotic War in the Soviet Union, the Party and the Soviet government also took various special measures to protect and develop the people's handicraft industry. The Soviet government once had a special resolution ordering these handicraft experts to be demobilized so that they could continue their own creative work. They were given many preferential treatments in terms of food and material supply, and various rare materials were allocated to them. At the same time, various apprentice schools were established around the old artists to train new cadres. The Soviet Union's spirit of valuing people's handicrafts is worthy of our country's adoption.

(4) Handicraft production cooperatives must strengthen production management, gradually promote the economic accounting system, minimize non-production personnel, vigorously carry out the campaign to increase production and practice economy, increase output, improve quality, reduce costs; and closely combine with state-owned enterprises and supply and marketing cooperatives, adhere to integrity, ensure product quality, continuously improve product quality and specifications according to people's needs, and promote sales to increase members' income. This is an important link in further consolidating and developing handicraft production cooperatives.

(5) Strengthen political education, and constantly pay attention to educating members with collectivism, overcoming capitalist tendencies within the cooperative, and ensuring that socialist components are constantly increasing.

(6) Under the conditions of continuous production growth and the gradual increase in the actual income of members, gradually increase public accumulation to create conditions for the handicraft production cooperative to move towards semi-mechanization and mechanization of production. The wages and labor dividends of members should not be higher than the wages of workers in the same industry in local state-owned enterprises.

The transition from manual production to machine production is a revolution in industrial technology. Experience has proven that, except for certain industries that cannot be produced by machines, handicraft production cooperatives themselves have accumulated, and with the country's industrialization, gradually adopting machine production has broad development prospects. However, when changing to machine production, there must be a careful design first, and the balance of supply, production, and sales must be seriously considered. Sufficient preparations must also be made for issues such as capital scheduling, technical mastery, labor organization, and production management. At the same time, the mechanization of handicrafts must be closely coordinated with the country's industrialization and cannot be carried out in isolation. The mechanization of handicrafts must be done with certainty after the implementation of division of labor and cooperation, the improvement of manual tools, and the improvement of technology. Any inadequate preparation, immature conditions, and blind mechanization are wrong.

V. In order to promote the socialist transformation of handicrafts, it is recommended that all state-owned economic departments, supply and marketing cooperatives, consumer cooperatives, and trade union systems provide necessary assistance to handicraft production cooperatives.

(1) State-owned commerce and supply and marketing cooperatives should closely integrate with handicraft production cooperatives through supply and sales operations, especially rural supply and marketing cooperatives should regard promoting the sales of handicraft products to supply farmers' production and living materials as one of their main businesses. State-owned commerce and supply and marketing cooperatives should guide handicraft production through supply and sales operations, and should implement reasonable reserves according to the seasonality of handicraft product sales so that handicraft production cooperatives can still maintain production in the off-season. This is an extremely important link in realizing the socialist transformation of handicrafts, freeing handicrafts from the exploitation of commercial capital, and bringing handicraft production into the national plan.

(2) When the state formulates industrial production plans, it should include the production plans of the main products of production cooperatives and the supply of raw materials required and the sales of main products in the national plan according to the principle of using local materials and selling locally, within the scope of local industry. If the local area cannot balance, the production plan should be reported to the State Planning Commission for unified balance by the central government.

(3) State-owned industry should, under the organization of the local financial committee, do its best to help local handicraft production cooperatives improve technology and improve business management. State-owned industries that need handicraft processing and assembly should organize production cooperatives to cooperate. In addition to supplying those needed by state-owned industries, the waste products and scraps of large state-owned enterprises should be preferentially supplied to production cooperatives that need these waste products and scraps to reduce the production costs of the cooperatives. Unused old equipment replaced by state-owned industries with new equipment can be transferred to production cooperatives that have the conditions for use at a low price.

(4) The state bank should allocate a certain percentage of its total annual loan amount to lend to handicraft production organizations, and provide necessary preferential treatment on interest rates.

(5) The tax authorities should formulate methods for handicraft production cooperatives to pay taxes, give reasonable and necessary care and preferential treatment, and help consolidate and develop production cooperatives.

(6) It is hoped that the trade union system will actively help and participate in the socialist transformation of handicrafts.

VI. While developing handicraft production cooperation, it is necessary to recognize that individual handicrafts still occupy an absolute advantage in handicraft production, and strengthening the leadership of the vast number of individual handicraft workers is an indispensable task for developing handicraft production and guiding individual handicraft workers to take the path of cooperation. For this reason, it is necessary to:

(1) Conduct propaganda of the general line, education on the socialist future, and education on the basic policies of production cooperatives to all handicraft laborers. Through the comparative education of individual handicraft production and cooperative production, improve the awareness of handicraft laborers and gradually embark on the socialist road.

(2) State-owned commerce, supply and marketing cooperatives, consumer cooperatives, and state banks should also provide possible and appropriate assistance to handicraft workers who have not yet been organized in terms of raw material supply, product sales, off-season production, and capital adjustment, according to different industries.

(3) Handicraft production cooperatives must strengthen unity with individual handicraft workers, give them possible assistance in production, and do not ridicule their backwardness or exclude them. Advanced helping backward is a basic principle of socialism. Members of production cooperatives should oppose departmentalism, sectarianism, and guild sentiments; advocate cooperative thinking, promote the spirit of mutual assistance, and use practical actions to prove that organization is better than working alone, and prove that the cooperative is the core of uniting individual handicraft workers, and gradually improve the awareness of individual handicraft workers, so that they gradually tend to cooperation.

(4) In order to strengthen the unity of handicraft workers and independent handicraft laborers, strengthen the unity of handicraft collective laborers and individual laborers, and give play to their production enthusiasm, various places can adopt the organizational form of handicraft worker representative meetings to widely organize all laborers engaged in handicraft production; and can choose several small and medium-sized towns to pilot the organization of mass organizations such as handicraft laborer associations to organize individual handicraft laborers, handicraft workers, and apprentices politically. Production cooperatives should also join the handicraft laborer association as group members. The handicraft worker representative meeting or the handicraft laborer association should become a close link between the Party, the People's Government, and the vast number of handicraft laborers. Their main task should be to unite all handicraft laborers and conduct socialist education on organizing and taking the road of cooperation among the vast number of handicraft laborers.

    中华全国合作社联合总社
    关于第三次全国手工业生产合作会议的报告
    中华全国合作社联合总社在一九五三年十一月二十日到十二月十七日召开了第三次全国手工业生产合作会议。参加会议的有各大区中华全国合作社联合总社办事处主任、各省市社生产处长、部分省市供销合作社、消费合作社、生产合作社联合社和若干基层社主任以及中央有关部门的代表。
    会议讨论的主要问题：
    一、手工业生产在我国国民经济中占有很重要的地位，由于现代工业产品的不足，手工业是供应城乡人民生产和生活资料的一种重要的经济力量。目前在我国各大中城市的工业中，手工业仍占有一定的比例；小城市的工业则几乎全部是手工业。根据各方面工作实践中的初步计算，全国城乡手工业工人和手工业独立劳动者达一千九百三十余万人（经过几年的发展，现已可能超过二千万人）；个体手工业和工场手工业的产值达一百万亿元（家庭和农民的手工副业未计在内）。手工业在整个国民经济生活中的重要作用表现在：（一）供应广大农民所需要的生产和生活资料。手工业产品在农民所需要的工业品中一般占百分之六十到七十，有的竟占百分之八十。在我国未实现工业化，农业未取得现代机器装备以前，手工业在农具的修理和制造方面，对发展农业生产的作用很大。（二）从事农产品和工业品的加工，并为国营大工业的配件修理和小型制造服务。（三）在国家实现社会主义工业化的过程中，为国家培养技术工人，是国营工业技术后备的重要源泉之一。（四）在供应城市居民所需要的日用品方面，手工业产品占有相当大的比重；为城乡居民生活服务的手工修理业，也有其特殊的作用。（五）制造各种工艺美术品，供应国内外市场。（六）维持和发展手工业，是目前城乡人民就业的一个重要方面。因此，我国手工业虽有一小部分已为现代工业所代替，或在经济改组过程中被淘汰；但很大部分仍有其存在价值和发展余地，而且就是在社会主义工业化实现以后，在很长的时期内手工业仍将是机器工业的经常的助手。否定手工业作用的观点，是不正确的。
    但另一方面，必须认识目前我国的手工业中，大部分还是个体的、小私有的手工业独立劳动者，其生产是分散的、落后的、盲目的、保守的。这种个体的、私有制的生产关系限制了手工业生产力的发展和新式技术的采用，不能克服生产上和产品销售上的困难，不能避免商业资本和高利贷的控制和剥削，也不能适应国家经济建设计划性的要求和人民不断增长的物质文化生活的需要。同时，个体手工业者作为小私有者和小商品出售者，时刻滋长着自发的资本主义倾向，如果任其自流，就不能避免走向少数人发财，大多数人贫穷破产的痛苦的资本主义道路。但个体手工业者又是劳动者，是依靠自己劳动，而不是依靠剥削别人为生的，这就决定了它们可以在工人阶级领导下逐步地走向社会主义。因此，实现对手工业的社会主义改造，是党在过渡时期总任务的一个不可缺少的组成部分。必须领导和教育手工业生产者，经过合作化的道路，逐步改变现存的手工业中的生产关系，逐步把个体手工业者的生产资料的私人所有制改变为集体所有制，逐步把分散的个体的小生产改变为集体生产，进行一些技术改革，促进其生产力的发展，以适应国家和人民的日益发展的需要，并且随着国家经济发展的状况，逐步实现手工业生产的机械化或半机械化。合作化是对手工业逐步实行社会主义改造、引导手工业者逐步过渡到社会主义和逐步走向机械化的唯一正确的必经之路。
    二、新民主主义革命在全国胜利后的四年多以来，城乡手工业合作化运动有了大的发展。一九五三年底的统计，手工业生产合作社有四千八百零六个，社员达三十万人，全年生产总值达五万二千亿元。在一九五四年内，参加各种形式手工业合作组织的手工业劳动者计划发展到九十余万人，产品总值将增至十万亿元以上。在第一个五年计划时期内要为手工业合作化运动建立巩固的基础，到一九五七年，各种手工业合作组织的成员计划发展到五百万人；生产总值达六十万亿元以上。预计第二个五年计划中期，在全国范围内基本上完成手工业合作化的组织任务，并进而谋求手工业生产合作社政治思想的提高和生产技术的革新，以适应国家社会主义工业化的要求。
    已经组织起来的手工业生产合作组织，均已在不同程度上表现了它的优越性，这种优越性表现在：
    （一）由于组织起来，首先就有可能克服个体手工业者过去在原料供应和产品推销上的严重困难，从而改变淡季停工、旺季脱销的现象，能够常年地连续生产。
    （二）由于组织起来，实行生产上的分工协作，就可以逐步改进落后的生产技术，提高劳动生产率，统一产品规格，增加产量，提高质量，降低成本。这不仅有利于农民和城市消费者，手工业生产合作社社员的收入也将随之增加，物质和文化生活也将随之得到改善，同时还可逐渐增加公共积累，为进一步改善技术装备和劳动条件准备物质基础。
    （三）由于组织起来，就更便利于手工业生产与国营企业和供销合作社建立经常的联系，从而也就增强了手工业生产的计划性，便于把手工业生产纳入国家计划经济的轨道中来，并取得国营企业和供销合作社的扶持和帮助，摆脱商业资本和高利贷的剥削和控制。
    （四）由于组织起来，就更便利于通过供销合作社或直接与农业生产互助合作组织订立结合合同，使自己产品的规格和质量更加适合于农民生产和消费的需要，既为自己的产品打开了销路，又有利于促进农业生产发展和巩固工农联盟。
    （五）已有不少手工业生产合作社，实现了生产资料归社员集体所有，生产收入完全按劳分配，另一些社也有若干公共积累，实行了部分收入按劳分配。这就大大提高了社员的劳动热情，打破了技术的保守性，更有利于发展生产。
    （六）手工业生产合作组织，通过生产活动和社务活动对手工业劳动者进行与实践密切相结合的集体主义教育和社会主义教育，因此就使得自己成为手工业劳动者的社会主义学校。
    在旧中国和资本主义社会里，贫困破产是手工业劳动者必然的命运；新中国的手工业劳动者，在中国共产党和人民政府的领导和扶助下，经过合作化道路，将逐步过渡到大家富裕的社会主义社会。
    三、在过渡时期国家总任务的照耀下，手工业者要求组织起来的积极性是更加高涨了，国家对手工业增产的需要也更为迫切。各级党委、人民政府和手工业生产的领导机关，必须充分估计到群众的这种积极性和国家的需要，根据手工业的特点及本地区手工业各行业的需要和可能条件，结合供产销，适当制订手工业合作化的发展计划。要求各级党委和人民政府按照积极领导稳步前进的方针，首先以手工业比较集中的城市和集镇为重点，依据群众的自愿，也就是依据当时当地群众的觉悟水平，采用多种多样的适合手工业特点的过渡形式，把手工业劳动者组织起来，逐步发展到完全社会主义性质的手工业生产合作社的高级形式。有一部分小手工业者，本人担负主要劳动，掌握主要技术，又雇用若干辅助性质的助手和学徒；仍应允许他参加手工业生产合作组织。但手工业资本家则不应吸收。
    根据四年来的经验，组织手工业合作化，下列三种形式是适当的。
    （一）手工业生产小组，是广泛组织手工业劳动者的一种低级形式，也是手工业劳动者最容易接受的组织形式。它首先从供销方面把手工业劳动者组织起来，有组织地向供销、消费合作社或国营企业购买原料，推销成品，或为供销、消费合作社和国营企业加工。这种形式既使手工业劳动者避免受商业资本的控制和剥削，又便于进一步对手工业实行改造。目前各地有许多这种类型的各种不同行业的手工业生产小组，它们主要是由供销、消费合作社组织起来的。今后还应更有计划地发展这种组织，并对原有的生产小组加以整顿；要爱护它、培养它，要帮助它在劳动组织、生产技术和产品规格方面逐步改进，并使之不断提高，逐步地向手工业生产合作社过渡。
    此外，还有一些手工业生产小组，已经实行了工具入股或工具公有，集中生产，共同劳动，收入完全按劳分配或部分按劳分配。这种小组仅由于成员人数较少而沿用小组的名称，实际是比较小型的手工业生产合作社。
    （二）手工业供销生产社，是由若干个体手工业劳动者或几个手工业生产小组为解决原料采购和产品推销的共同困难而组织起来的。这种手工业供销生产社的主要活动是统一地向供销、消费合作社或国营企业购买原料，推销成品，统一承揽供销、消费合作社或国营企业的加工订货。这种组织形式的好处是更能有效地克服小生产者的困难，更便于帮助生产小组和社员逐步改变生产关系，逐步克服家长制度和改善师徒关系，逐步以劳动者之间的互助合作关系来代替雇主与雇工的关系。同时，手工业供销生产社也有可能以自己业务经营中的积累来购置公有的生产工具，进行部分的集中生产，并逐渐增加社会主义因素，为稳步提高到手工业生产合作社准备条件。手工业供销生产社和生产小组，由于主要是在供销方面组织起来，因而就不能避免常常发生淡季来、旺季去、偷工减料、粗制滥造等不良现象。这是小生产者克服困难后可能滋生的资本主义倾向，对此必须注意教育防止。防止的办法，就是进一步从生产方面组织起来，提高到手工业生产合作社。但某些行业由于分散的生产方式和技术条件所限制，可较长时期地保持生产小组、供销生产社形式；不必勉强地进行集中生产，以免浪费劳动力，发生不合理现象。
    （三）手工业生产合作社，是手工业社会主义改造的高级形式。现有的四千多个手工业生产合作社中，一部分社的主要生产资料已完全归社员集体所有，完全实行了按劳分配，这已经是完全社会主义性质的生产合作社。还有一大部分社的主要生产资料尚未完全成为集体所有，实行工具入股分红，统一经营，收益之一部采取按劳分配，这是半社会主义性质的生产合作社。
    四、为贯彻总路线，实现对手工业的社会主义改造，必须根据当地手工业的具体情况，根据生产发展的需要和手工业劳动群众的觉悟程度，采用群众所能接受的组织形式，由群众自愿地组织起来；必须坚持积极领导，稳步前进的方针，既反对要求过高过急，贪大贪多，盲目发展，也反对放任自流，停步不前。手工业生产合作社目前还处在初步发展阶段，必须培养典型，做好榜样，这对于推动手工业劳动者走合作化的道路是有重要意义的。
    要办好手工业生产合作社，必须遵守下列各项原则：
      （一）本就地取材，就地制造，就地供应的原则，选择当地有发展前途的行业建社，并加强生产的计划性，使生产合作社有原料，有销路，能够巩固和发展。
    （二）坚持自愿互利的原则，防止强迫命令，发扬社内民主。现金入股、工具入股作价、工资制度、劳力分红制度和股金分红等问题，必须经社员民主讨论，求得合理解决，以保证所有的社员都能得到应得的合理收益。
    （三）手工业生产技术很重要，我国手工业有高等技术，特别是我国特种手工艺品，精致美观，技艺高超，充分表现出我国劳动人民的智慧和创造性。如象牙雕刻、雕石、漆器、景泰蓝、湘绣、烟台花边和景德镇的瓷器等等，都已驰名国外。为着保存和发扬我国民族艺术的传统，必须认真地组织青年艺徒向有高等技术的民间老艺人学习。否则，某些特种手工艺，如不予以特别爱护，任其衰落下去，就会“人亡艺绝，绝技失传”。苏联在伟大的卫国战争最艰苦的年代中，党和苏维埃政府还采取各种特殊措施来保护和发展人民手工艺行业。苏联政府曾经有一个特别决议，令这些手工艺能手退伍，以便继续他们自己的创造性的工作。在粮食和物质供应方面给予了他们很多优待，并拨给他们各种稀有材料。同时围绕着老辈艺匠设立了各种培养新干部的艺徒学校。苏联这种重视人民手工艺的精神，足资我国取法。
    （四）手工业生产合作社必须加强生产管理，逐步推行经济核算制，尽量减少非生产人员，努力开展增产节约运动，增加产量，提高质量，降低成本；并与国营企业和供销、消费合作社密切结合，坚守信用，保证产品质量，根据人民需要不断改进产品质量和规格，推广销路，以增加社员收入。这是进一步巩固与发展手工业生产合作社的重要环节。
    （五）加强政治教育，经常地注意以集体主义教育社员，克服社内的资本主义倾向，保证社会主义成份不断增加。
    （六）在生产不断增长和社员实际收入逐年有所增加的条件下，逐渐增加公共积累，为手工业生产合作社走向生产的半机械化和机械化创造条件。社员的工资和劳力分红，应不高于当地国营企业同业工人的工资。
    从手工生产到机器生产是工业技术上的革命。经验证明：除某些不能用机器进行生产的行业外，手工业生产合作社本身有了积累，随着国家工业化，而逐步采用机器生产，是有广阔发展前途的。但是，改用机器生产时，必须先有周密的设计，必须切实考虑供产销三方面的平衡，对资金调度、技术掌握、劳动组织和生产管理等等问题，也都要有充分准备。同时，手工业机械化还必须与国家工业化密切配合起来，不能孤立进行。手工业机械化必须在实行了分工协作，手工工具有了改进，提高了技术等条件下，有把握地去做。任何准备不够，条件不成熟，而盲目机械化，都是错误的。
    五、为促进对手工业的社会主义改造，建议一切国营经济部门，供销、消费合作社，工会系统对手工业生产合作社进行必要的援助。
    （一）国营商业和供销、消费合作社要通过供销业务和手工业生产合作社密切结合起来，特别是农村供销合作社应将推销手工业产品以供应农民生产和生活资料当做自己的主要业务之一。国营商业和供销、消费合作社应通过供销业务指导手工业生产，并应根据手工业产品销售的季节性实行合理的储备，使手工业生产合作社在淡季仍能维持生产。这是实现对手工业的社会主义改造，使手工业摆脱商业资本的剥削，并使手工业生产纳入国家计划的极为重要的一环。
    （二）国家在编制工业生产计划时，应把生产合作社主要产品的生产计划及所需要的原材料的供应和主要产品的销售，根据就地取材，就地推销的原则，按照地方工业范围列入国家计划。地方不能平衡者，则应将生产计划报告国家计划委员会，由中央统一平衡。
    （三）国营工业应在当地财委组织之下尽力帮助当地手工业生产合作社提高技术，改进经营管理工作。国营工业需要手工业加工、装配者，应组织生产合作社配合进行。国营大企业的废品废料除供给国营需要者外应优先供给需要这些废品废料的生产合作社，以减低合作社的生产成本。国营工业使用新式设备而替换下来的不用的旧设备，可廉价转让给有条件使用的生产合作社。
    （四）国家银行应在其每年的贷款总额中，分配出一定比例的资金，贷给手工业生产合作组织，并在利息上予以必要的优待。
    （五）税收机关应制定手工业生产合作社纳税的办法，给予合理的必要的照顾和优待，帮助生产合作社的巩固和发展。
    （六）希望工会系统积极帮助和参加手工业社会主义改造工作。
    六、在发展手工业生产合作化的同时，必须认清个体手工业在手工业生产中目前仍占居绝对优势，加强对广大的个体手工业者的领导，对于发展手工业生产，引导个体手工业者走合作化道路，是一件不可忽视的工作。为此，就必须：
    （一）向一切手工业劳动者进行总路线的宣传，进行社会主义前途的教育，进行生产合作社基本政策的教育。通过个体手工业生产和合作社生产的对比教育，提高手工业劳动者的觉悟，使之逐步走上社会主义道路。
    （二）国营商业、供销、消费合作社和国家银行对尚未组织起来的手工业者，在原料供应、产品推销、淡季生产、资金调剂等问题上，亦应根据不同的行业予以可能的适当的援助。
    （三）手工业生产合作社必须加强和个体手工业者的团结，在生产上给他们以可能的帮助，不要讥笑他们落后，不要排斥他们。先进的帮助落后的是社会主义的基本原则，生产合作社的社员应该反对本位主义，宗派主义和行会情绪；提倡合作思想，发扬互助精神，用实际行动，证明组织起来比单干好，证明合作社是团结个体手工业者的核心，逐步地提高个体手工业者的觉悟，使他们逐渐倾向合作化。
      （四）为了加强手工业工人和手工业独立劳动者的团结，加强手工业集体劳动者和个体劳动者的团结，并发挥其生产积极性，各地可采取手工业者代表会议这种组织形式，把一切从事手工业生产的劳动者广泛地组织起来；并可选择几个中小城镇试行组织手工业劳动者协会这种群众性的组织，把手工业独立劳动者、手工业工人和学徒从政治上组织起来。生产合作社亦应以团体会员的资格加入手工业劳动者协会。手工业劳动者代表会议或手工业劳动者协会，应成为党、人民政府和广大手工业劳动者密切联系的纽带。它们的主要任务应该是：团结全体手工业劳动者并在广大的手工业劳动者中进行组织起来走合作化道路的社会主义教育。（新华社）
