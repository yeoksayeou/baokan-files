Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, July 4th: The expansion project of the state-owned Tangshan Steel Plant has been completed more than two months ahead of schedule and officially put into production. After the expansion project is put into production, according to new measurements, the plant's steel ingot production will increase by 58% compared to the past.

The Tangshan Steel Plant's expansion project includes ten projects such as the construction and renovation of converter seats, blowers, and ingot casting pools. Construction of these projects began on February 25th of this year and was originally scheduled for completion on September 1st. However, due to the efforts of all employees, 80% of all projects were completed by the end of May. In June, construction personnel launched a labor competition under the slogan of welcoming "July 1st" with practical actions, which greatly accelerated the progress of the project and ensured its quality.

On June 28th, all employees of the Tangshan Steel Plant solemnly held a completion celebration meeting. At the meeting, Cai Liancheng, a steelmaking worker, and Zhao Naibin, an engineering personnel, spoke on behalf of the employees, expressing their determination to maintain the new equipment and produce more and better steel for the motherland.

    唐山钢厂扩建工程提前完工正式投入生产
    【新华社保定四日电】国营唐山钢厂的扩建工程已提前两个多月完工，并正式投入生产。扩建工程投入生产后，根据新的测定，这个厂的钢锭产量将比过去提高百分之五十八。
    唐山钢厂扩建工程，包括新建和改建转炉座、鼓风机、铸锭池等十项工程。这些工程自今年二月二十五日开始施工，原定九月一日完工，但由于全体职工的努力，到五月底就完成全部工程的百分之八十；六月份，施工人员又在以实际行动迎接“七一”的口号下展开劳动竞赛，因此工程进展很快，并保证了工程质量。
    六月二十八日，唐山钢厂全体职工隆重举行了完工庆祝大会。会上，这个厂的炼钢工人蔡连成和工程人员赵乃斌代表职工讲话，表示一定要维护好新设备，为祖国炼出更多更好的钢来。
