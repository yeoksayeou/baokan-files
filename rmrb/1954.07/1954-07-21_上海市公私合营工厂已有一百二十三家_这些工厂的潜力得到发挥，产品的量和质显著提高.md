    Shanghai's Joint State-Private Factories Reach 123
    Potential is Unleashed, Quantity and Quality of Products Significantly Improved
    Xinhua News Agency: In the first half of this year, 57 private factories in Shanghai were reorganized into joint state-private enterprises. Currently, there are a total of 123 joint state-private factories in Shanghai.

    The 57 factories that became joint ventures in the first half of this year were among the larger private factories in Shanghai, with relatively complete equipment, and whose products were closely related to national construction and people's livelihoods. Among these 57 factories, 28 were heavy industry factories directly manufacturing various machines, machine parts, and accessories for the nation's basic construction projects. Most factories, in the first quarter or even the first month after the joint venture was established, showed a new atmosphere of completing or even exceeding the state production tasks on schedule. Some factories, in order to meet the needs of national construction, also successfully trial-produced new products. Before the joint venture, Datong Iron Factory once manufactured 160 hexagonal lathes for the state, but delivered them five months late, affecting the production of several factories. Since the factory was reorganized into a joint state-private enterprise in February this year, it has been able to complete its production tasks on schedule, and the production tasks for the second quarter were completed ahead of schedule on June 25, with product quality fully meeting specifications. The workers of Dalong and Taili Machinery Factories, famous for manufacturing textile machines, completed the task of manufacturing 50 carding machines ahead of schedule and successfully trial-produced two new products, the "53" type spinning machine and calcium carbide, in the two months from hearing that the People's Government approved the implementation of joint state-private ownership to the official announcement of the implementation of joint ownership, and proposed more than 170 rationalization proposals. Factories familiar to consumers all over the country, such as Zhengtai Rubber Factory, Xinyi Pharmaceutical Factory, Wuzhou Guben Soap Factory, Jin Xing Fountain Pen Factory, Jin Qian Hot Water Bottle Factory, and Tongyi Yarn Factory, also implemented joint state-private ownership in the first half of this year. Now, or after another period, the shuttlecock shoes, Wuzhou Guben soap, Jin Xing fountain pens, Jin Qian hot water bottles, and various medicines marked "Produced by 'Xinyi'" supplied by state-owned specialized companies to people all over the country will no longer be products of private factories, but products of joint state-private factories. Not long ago, a customer bought a pair of shuttlecock shoes produced by Zhengtai Rubber Factory at the Shanghai No. 1 Department Store of the China Department Store Corporation. He looked at it over and over again, without finding any faults, and then looked at the box containing the shoes, and said with satisfaction: "So this is a product of a joint state-private factory!"

    Many capitalists in Shanghai are now also beginning to realize the superiority of joint state-private enterprises. Liu Jingji, the private shareholder representative of Anda Yarn Factory, once said: If the transformation of private capitalist enterprises remains at the stage of accepting state processing orders, it is far from enough, because the old relations of production still restrict the development of productive forces. Wei Ru, the factory director and private representative of the Xinzhong Power Machine Factory, a joint state-private venture, also said: I have run a factory for more than 20 years, but it has never been well-managed. Now I realize that the factory can only be well-managed under the direct leadership of the socialist economy. Among the 66 factories that became joint ventures before this year, the superiority of joint state-private enterprises is even clearer. Many of these factories have expanded or built new factory buildings, increased machinery and equipment, and increased output, making more contributions to national construction and people's lives. The Zhonghua Shipyard has only been under joint state-private ownership for two years, and it has developed from a dilapidated small repair shipyard into a very large shipyard. The factory buildings and machinery have doubled compared to before the joint venture, the number of workers has increased sixfold, and the planned total output value this year is six times greater than the total output value in 1952. Currently, the tonnage of a large ocean-going freighter being built by this factory is equivalent to twice the tonnage of various ships repaired and built throughout 1952. After seeing the development of the Zhonghua Shipyard, many private shipyards in Shanghai have applied to the People's Government to implement joint state-private ownership and hope to join the Zhonghua Shipyard. Among the factories that became joint ventures before this year, some did not expand in terms of factory buildings and machinery, but due to the change in the nature of the enterprise and the improvement of business management, the potential capacity of the enterprise was more fully utilized, thus significantly increasing the output and quality of products.

    上海市公私合营工厂已有一百二十三家
    这些工厂的潜力得到发挥，产品的量和质显著提高
    今年上半年，上海有五十七家私营工厂改组为公私合营企业。目前，上海市的公私合营工厂共有一百二十三家。
    今年上半年合营的五十七家工厂，在上海私营工厂中是规模比较大、设备比较齐全、产品和国家建设及人民生活有密切关系的厂子。这五十七家工厂中，有二十八家是直接为国家的基本建设工程制造各种机器、机器零件和配件的重工业工厂。大多数厂在合营后的第一个季度或第一个月，就出现了按期完成或者提前完成国家生产任务的新气象。有些厂为着适应国家建设的需要，还试制成功了新产品。大同铁工厂在合营前一次为国家制造的一百六十部六角车床，竟过期五个月才交货，影响了若干工厂的生产。这个厂自今年二月改组为公私合营企业后，都能按期完成生产任务，第二季度的生产任务提前在六月二十五日完成，产品质量完全合乎规格。以制造纺织机著名的大隆、泰利两机器厂的工人，在听到人民政府批准两厂实行公私合营到正式宣布实行合营的两个多月中，提前完成了制造五十部梳棉机的任务，试制成功了“五三”型细纱机和电石两种新产品，并提出了一百七十多件合理化建议。为各地消费者所熟悉的正泰橡胶厂、信谊药厂、五洲固本肥皂厂、金星金笔厂、金钱牌热水瓶厂、统益纱厂等工厂，也都是在今年上半年实行公私合营的。现在，或者再过一个时期，国营专业公司供应各地人民的回力球鞋、五洲固本肥皂、金星金笔、金钱牌热水瓶和标有“‘信谊’出品”的各种药品，就不再是私营厂的产品，而是公私合营厂的产品了。不久以前，一位顾客在中国百货公司上海市公司第一百货商店里买了一双正泰橡胶厂出品的回力球鞋，他翻来覆去地看了又看，没有找出什么毛病，然后看了装鞋的盒子，满意地说：“原来这是公私合营厂的出品了！”
    对于公私合营企业的优越性，上海许多资本家现在也开始体会到了。安达纱厂的私股代表刘靖基曾说：私人资本主义企业的改造如果停留在接受国家加工订货这个阶段上，那是很不够的，因为旧的生产关系仍旧限制着生产力的发展。公私合营新中动力机厂厂长、私方代表魏如也说：我办了二十几年的工厂，一直没有办好，现在才体会到只有在社会主义经济的直接领导下，工厂才能办好。在今年以前合营的六十六家工厂中，公私合营企业的优越性看得更清楚。这些工厂有许多扩建或新建了厂房，增加了机器设备和提高了产量，对国家建设和人民生活作了更多的贡献。中华造船厂实行公私合营才两年，就已从一个破烂的小修船厂发展成为一个规模很大的造船厂了。厂房和机器比合营前增加了两倍，工人增加了六倍，今年计划中的生产总值比一九五二年的生产总值大六倍。目前这个厂正在制造的一艘海运大货轮，其吨位就相当于一九五二年全年修造的各种船舶吨位的两倍。上海许多私营造船厂在看到中华造船厂的发展后，纷纷向人民政府申请实行公私合营并希望参加到中华造船厂去。在今年以前合营的工厂中，也有一些在厂房、机器方面没有进行扩充的，但由于企业性质的改变，经营管理的改善，企业的潜在能力得到比较充分的发挥，因此也显著提高了产品的产量和质量。
