    Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Establishes First Agricultural Tractor Station
    (Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, July 4th) The first tractor station in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region was established on July 1st this year in Qianjiadian, Tongliao County, Zhelimumeng. The tractor station has six tractors of various types and more than ten kinds of agricultural machinery such as seeders, planters, and threshers. It will gradually develop into a tractor station capable of cultivating 75,000 mu of land. On the day of trial cultivation before the station was established, more than 500 members of nearby agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid team members, and individual farmers came to visit. Everyone praised the "iron ox" for its great power. This autumn, the tractors of the tractor station will plow the land for the four agricultural production cooperatives of Red Star, Shuangxing, New Hero, and New Victory nearby. At present, the tractor station and the agricultural production cooperatives are jointly studying and formulating production contracts.
    The station master and a mechanized farming team leader of the tractor station are Mongolian cadres. Before the establishment of the station, they were transferred to the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government for special study. In addition, the Department of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry of the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region also trained 64 Mongolian and Han tractor drivers, male and female, at this station. This group of tractor drivers will be assigned to state-owned mechanical farms and tractor stations after graduation next year.

    内蒙古自治区建立第一个农业拖拉机站
    【新华社呼和浩特四日电】内蒙古自治区第一个拖拉机站今年七月一日在哲里木盟通辽县钱家店建立。拖拉机站有各式拖拉机六部以及选种机、播种机、脱谷机等十多种农业机械，将逐渐发展成为能耕作七万五千亩土地的拖拉机站。建站前试耕的那一天，附近的农业生产合作社社员、互助组组员和单干农民共五百多人赶来参观，大家异口同声地称赞“铁牛”力量大。今年秋天，拖拉机站的拖拉机就要给附近的红星、双星、新英雄、新胜利等四个农业生产合作社翻地。现在，拖拉机站正和农业生产合作社共同研究，订立生产合同。
    拖拉机站的站长和一个机耕队长是蒙族干部，建站前他们曾被调到中央人民政府农业部去进行专门学习。另外，内蒙古自治区人民政府农牧部还在这个站里训练六十四名蒙、汉族男女拖拉机手，这批拖拉机手明年毕业后将分配到国营机械农场和拖拉机站工作。
