Further Study, Promotion and Discussion of the Draft Constitution

    The Joy of a Township Head in the Mountains
    Cháng Lí
    As soon as the good news of the promulgation of the draft constitution reached Songban Township, deep in the mountains of Jiangyou County, Sichuan Province, Deputy Township Head Wen Huanzhang handed over a copy of the Sichuan Daily containing the draft constitution to be circulated among the villages. A happy smile appeared on the faces of the mountain people.
    Wen Huanzhang – a man born and raised in this mountain ravine, who lived a life of slavery before liberation, is now leading the people of the whole township in diligently building a prosperous and beautiful mountain area. He felt particularly excited about the promulgation of the draft constitution.

    Here, clumps of tung trees grow on the hillside. These beautiful tung trees were planted after liberation. The straight tung trees are covered with large tung leaves and tung fruits. When the sun shines on them, the green color turns golden, which is really delightful to see.
    After Wen Huanzhang finished promoting the draft constitution in Guo Xuegao's joint group in the Second Village, he felt tired on his way back to the township people's government. He stood under a tung tree to rest. He supported himself on the tree with one hand, took off his hat with the other to fan himself, and stared at the mountains and valleys full of trees in a daze. The joy of the group members discussing the draft constitution just now kept swirling in his mind.
    "Look! The draft constitution stipulates that the state protects the interests of us farmers, encourages us to take the road of cooperation, and adopts policies of restricting and gradually eliminating the rich peasant economy," said group member Luo Gaozheng, raising his voice.
    "The people's constitution is to protect our interests!" said one group member.
    "That's good. The tung trees we have worked so hard to plant are protected by the constitution and will no longer be encroached upon by the local tyrants," said another group member.
    The group members expressed many opinions. Their words made Wen Huanzhang feel intimately that the beautiful mountains and forests are truly the fruits of the people's victory. He thought that in the four years since the farmers had diligently planted trees, no local tyrants had come to cut them down, and now with the constitution, there would be even more guarantees. He also recalled the situation before liberation: at that time, countless fir, cypress, pine and tung trees were scattered on the hillsides within dozens of miles around, and these trees were all occupied and cut down by the "earth emperor" Wang Yucheng. Wen Huanzhang's family's more than seven hundred mature "ironclad pines" were no exception. Wang Yucheng verbally offered to pay for them, but no one ever saw a penny of his money. The farmers could not bear Wang Yucheng's oppression and sued him to the county, but the county pushed the case to the district, and the district head was none other than Wang Yucheng. Wang Yucheng beat to death the brothers Tang Zhengkuang and Jing Yuanding, the farmers who sued him, and threw them into the wilderness. Thinking of this, he spat fiercely with contempt and said to himself, "The Kuomintang's so-called law is just a law to deceive us and oppress us working people."
    II
    After liberation, under the leadership of the Party, Wen Huanzhang led the masses in a series of social reform movements. The murderous demon was suppressed, the farmers were given land, and Wen Huanzhang became the village head during rent reduction and deposit refunds, and later became the deputy township head. He and Township Head Huang Qunjiang loved this mountain ravine and were determined to develop production in the mountain area. But here they encountered many difficulties. Although Songban Township has only four villages, they are scattered in the mountains, and people often have to cross several uninhabited mountain tops to get from one village to another. At first, some poor farmers who had obtained land borrowed high-interest loans from rich peasants due to lack of means of production, but they could not repay the loans and even pawned their land to rich peasants. Wen Huanzhang and Huang Qunjiang saw that if this continued, some farmers would once again follow the old path of "the poor getting poorer and the rich getting richer." Later, according to the instructions of the district committee, they organized many mutual aid groups according to the characteristics of the mountain area, solved the difficulties of the poor farmers, and restricted the exploitation of the rich peasants. From then on, the phenomenon of land concentration in the hands of rich peasants was reduced, but the arrogance of the rich peasants was still not suppressed. It was not until the publicity of the General Line last year that they truly understood how to deal with the exploitation of the rich peasants. Now, they are even more pleased to see that the draft constitution stipulates that the state encourages farmers to take the road of collectivization and adopts policies to restrict and gradually eliminate the rich peasant economy. Thinking of these provisions, Wen Huanzhang felt full of energy, and he said happily, "If we didn't have a little 'handle' for doing socialism, how could we bring it up? I think, the constitution is really the 'handle' to guarantee socialist construction!"
    III
    On June 18th, Songban Township held a meeting of the Township People's Congress to study and discuss the draft constitution and elected Huang Qunjiang as a representative to the County People's Congress. Jiao Xuexue, the people's representative from Guo Xuegao's joint group, made a suggestion at the meeting. He said that their joint group had a sandy beach that could not grow crops all year round. If soil was transported to fill the sandy beach, it could be turned into good land, and at least 45,000 catties of grain could be harvested each year. Each member of the joint group also requested to be converted into an agricultural production cooperative this year, concentrating their efforts to transform this land. The current difficulty is that the township does not have the resources to solve the problem of transporting soil. He asked Huang Qunjiang to take this opinion to the county for discussion, and if the government has no other difficulties at present, please ask the county to find a way to help them.
    All the township representatives agreed with the suggestion made by Jiao Xuexue at the meeting.
    When Wen Huanzhang saw the masses' enthusiasm for building a socialist society, his heart beat violently. He said excitedly: "Lao Huang will definitely take this matter to research. After everyone studies the draft constitution, they should make more suggestions on production. If everyone can do this, our township's work will be done better."

### 山区乡长的喜悦

专栏：进一步学习、宣传和讨论宪法草案

    山区乡长的喜悦
    长犁
    宪法草案公布的喜讯一传到四川省江油县深山里的松板乡，副乡长文焕章便把一份登载着宪法草案的四川日报，交给各村轮流传看。山里人们的脸上挂上了幸福的微笑。
    文焕章——这个在山沟里土生土长的人，解放前过着奴隶般生活，而现在却带领全乡人民辛勤地建设着繁荣美丽的山区。他对于宪法草案的公布，特别感到兴奋。
    一
    这里山坡上长着一丛一丛的桐树。这些美丽的桐树，是在解放后种植起来的。笔直的桐子树上，长着肥大的桐叶和桐子，太阳一照，绿中透着金黄的颜色，看了真是令人高兴。
    文焕章在二村郭学高联组宣传宪法草案以后，在回乡人民政府的路上走得累了，就站在一棵桐树底下休息。他一只手扶着树，一只手把帽子揭下来扇风，眼睛望着满山满沟的树林出神。刚才组员们讨论宪法草案的那股子欢喜劲，直在他的脑子里打转转。
    “快看！宪法草案规定国家保护我们农民的利益，鼓励我们走合作化的道路，对富农经济还采取限制和逐步消灭的政策。”组员罗高正提高了嗓子说。
    “人民的宪法就是保障我们的利益的！”一个组员说。
    “这就好了，我们辛辛苦苦栽的桐树，受到宪法保护，再也不会被恶霸们侵占了。”另一个组员又说。
    组员们发表了许多意见。他们的话，使文焕章亲切地感到：美丽的山林真是人民胜利的果实。他想着，四年来农民辛勤栽植的树木，没有恶霸来砍伐了，今后有了宪法，就更有保障。他又想起了解放以前的情形：那时，这周围数十里的山坡上散布着无数的杉、柏、松树和桐树，这些树都被“土皇帝”王雨成霸占着砍光了。文焕章家三房人的七百多根成材的“铁甲松”当然也没有例外。王雨成口说出钱买，可是谁也没有见到他的一文钱。农民受王雨成压迫不过，把他告到县里，县里又把案子推到区里，而区长就正是王雨成。王雨成把告他的农民唐正广、敬元鼎两弟兄，都打死扔到荒野里去了。他想到这里，鄙弃地狠狠地吐了一口唾沫，自言自语地说：“国民党的所谓法律不过是哄我们，整我们劳动人民的法律罢了。”
    二
    解放后，文焕章在党的领导下，带领群众进行了一系列的社会改革运动。杀人的魔王被镇压了，农民分得了土地，文焕章在减租退押时就当了村长，后来当了副乡长。他和乡长黄群江热爱着这个山沟，一心想把山区生产发展起来。可是这里遇到许多困难。松板乡虽然只有四个村，却散处在崇山峻岭中，从一个村到另外一个村，人们往往要翻过几个没有人烟的山头。最初，有些得到土地的贫苦农民，因为缺乏生产资料，就向富农借高利贷，可是借了还不起，竟把自己的土地典当给富农了。文焕章和黄群江看到，如果这样发展下去，某些农户又要走“穷的穷，富的富”的老路了。以后，他们根据区委的指示，按照山区的特点组织了许多互助组，解决了贫苦农民的困难，才限制了富农的剥削。从此，农民当地的现象是少了，可是富农的气焰还是没有压下去。直到去年宣传总路线以后，他们才真正懂得怎样对付富农的剥削。现在，他们又看到宪法草案上规定国家鼓励农民走合作化的道路，对富农经济要采取限制和逐步消灭的政策，就更加高兴了。文焕章想着这些条文，浑身都有了劲，他又高兴地说：“搞社会主义，没点‘把凭’还提得起来吗？我看哪，宪法真是保障社会主义建设的‘把凭’咧！”
    三
    六月十八日，松板乡举行乡人民代表大会会议，学习和讨论了宪法草案，并选出黄群江为县人民代表大会的代表。郭学高联组的人民代表焦学雪在会上提出一个建议。他说，他们联组有一块沙坝，上边终年不长庄稼，如果运土填在沙坝上，就能把它变成好地，每年至少可收四万五千斤的粮食。而联组的每一个组员也都要求在今年转为农业生产合作社，集中力量改造这块土地。现在的困难，就是运土工具乡里没有力量解决。他要求黄群江把这个意见带到县里讨论，如果目前政府没有旁的困难，就请县里设法帮助他们。
    全体乡代表都赞同焦学雪在会上提出的建议。
    文焕章看到群众这种建设社会主义社会的积极性时，心激烈地跳动起来，他兴奋地说：“老黄一定把这个事情带去研究一下。大家学习了宪法草案以后，更要在生产上多提些建议，如果人人都能这样，我们乡的工作就会办得更好。”
