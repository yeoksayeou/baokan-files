    The Chinese Academy of Sciences held a symposium in Beijing from the 5th to the 10th to exchange and summarize the gains and experiences in learning from the Soviet Union. More than 150 people attended the symposium, including leading members of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, representatives elected by various research institutions, and heads of some research institutions.
    The symposium covered a wide range of topics, mainly including studying Marxism-Leninism; studying the theories of Soviet science masters such as Michurin, Pavlov, Lepeshinskaya, and Williams, as well as important Soviet scientific works; applying Soviet scientific achievements in practical work; and learning Russian and translating Russian anthologies. Scientific workers used concrete examples and personal experiences from their practical work to illustrate the superiority and advanced nature of Soviet science. Zoologist Chen Zhen has been studying goldfish genetics for many years. In the past, due to the influence of bourgeois academic thought, he was unable to understand goldfish genetics. Since studying Michurin's theory, his research on this issue has made significant progress. At the meeting, this veteran scientist convincingly explained the origin and heredity of goldfish from theoretical and historical perspectives, using Michurin's principle of "the unity of organism and living environment." Microbiologist Qiu Weifan said in his speech: "If you don't understand the basic principles of dialectical materialism, you can't appreciate the wonders of Michurin's biological science. For example, in my early studies, I couldn't figure out why the 'gene' theory was metaphysical, or why the 'theory of recapitulation' was an anti-evolutionary concept. After having a preliminary understanding of dialectical materialism, I made further progress in understanding these issues."
    The speeches of many representatives at the symposium showed that since studying the Soviet Union, the researchers of the Chinese Academy of Sciences have made great gains in their thinking and practical work. The ideological gains are: the initial establishment of a scientific worldview and scientific methodology; the establishment of correct views on some basic concepts and fundamental issues in many scientific departments, clarifying many incorrect views generated under the influence of bourgeois reactionary academic thought; and the clarification of directions in many scientific departments where research directions were previously unclear—such as psychology, taxonomy, cytology, and morphology, and genetics—some new questions have now been identified, thereby greatly strengthening the confidence of researchers.
    Along with the above-mentioned ideological gains, the application of advanced Soviet scientific theories and achievements in practical work has also produced results. For example, the research on the establishment of medium-term weather forecasts, the improvement of blast furnace bricks, the manufacture of corundum porcelain knives, iron ore magnetic separation, and petroleum analysis have all made satisfactory achievements due to learning from the Soviet Union. In terms of learning Russian, within a short period of one year, 93.2% of the staff in the entire academy have learned Russian, of which 73.5% can already read professional Soviet anthologies, and 26.8% can already translate professional Russian anthologies. According to incomplete statistics, they have translated more than 15 million words of Russian anthologies, creating favorable conditions for learning advanced Soviet science.

    中国科学院举行座谈会
    交流和总结学习苏联的收获和心得
    中国科学院自五日至十日在北京举行座谈会，交流和总结学习苏联的收获和心得。参加座谈会的有中国科学院的负责人、所属各研究机构推选出来的代表和部分研究机构的负责人等共一百五十多人。
    座谈会涉及的范围很广泛，主要包括学习马克思列宁主义；学习苏联科学大师米丘林、巴甫洛夫、勒柏辛斯卡娅、威廉姆斯等的学说和重要的苏联科学著作；在实际工作中应用苏联科学的成就以及学习俄文和翻译俄文文选等。科学工作者都用实际工作中的具体事例和亲身的体验说明了苏联科学的优越性和先进性。动物学家陈桢研究金鱼遗传已有很多年，过去由于受了资产阶级学术思想的影响，一直无法理解金鱼的遗传。自从学习了米丘林学说，他对这个问题的研究有了重要的发展。这位老科学家在会上用米丘林关于“有机体与生存环境统一”的原理令人信服地对金鱼的起源和遗传从理论方面和历史方面作了详细的解释。微生物学家裘维蕃在发言中说：“如果不懂得辩证唯物主义的基本原则，那么学习米丘林生物科学就无法认识它的妙处。例如我在初期的学习中就无法想通为什么‘基因’学说是形而上学的；为什么‘循环发生论’是反进化论的观念，对辩证唯物主义有了初步认识后，对这些问题的理解就进了一步。”
    座谈会上许多代表的发言说明了中国科学院的研究人员自从学习苏联以来，在思想上和实际工作中都有了很大收获。思想上的收获是：初步建立了科学的世界观和科学的思想方法；对许多科学部门中的一些基本概念和根本问题树立了正确的看法，澄清了在资产阶级反动学术思想影响下产生的许多不正确的观点；在好些过去研究方向不明确的科学部门内——如心理学、分类学、细胞学、形态学、遗传学等，现在已明确了方向，找出了一些新的问题，因而大大加强了研究人员的工作信心。
    和上述思想上的收获同时，苏联先进科学理论和成就在实际工作中的应用也就产生了果实。例如关于建立中期天气预报、高炉砖的改进、钢玉质瓷刀的制造、铁矿磁选、石油分析等问题的研究都由于学习苏联而有了满意的成果。在学习俄文方面，在短短一年的时间内全院已有百分之九十三点二的人员学会了俄文，其中百分之七十三点五的人员已能阅读专业苏联文选，百分之二十六点八的人员已能翻译专业俄文文选，据不完全统计，他们已翻译了一千五百多万字的俄文文选，对学习苏联先进科学创造了良好的条件。（新华社）
