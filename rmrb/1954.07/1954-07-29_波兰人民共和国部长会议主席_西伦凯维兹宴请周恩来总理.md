As Bierut, Cyrankiewicz, and Premier Zhou Enlai entered the reception hall together, the band played the national anthems of the People's Republic of China and the Polish People's Republic.

At the beginning of the reception, the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Poland, Cyrankiewicz, delivered a welcoming speech, saying: "The government of the Polish People's Republic and the entire Polish people are very pleased to welcome Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, to our capital. This is the first visit by a Chinese Premier to Poland. We are extremely happy about this. For many years, the Polish people, especially the Polish working class and all progressive people, have watched with fervent sympathy and confidence the arduous and heroic struggle of the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, to achieve national and social liberation.

When our country was liberated from Nazi occupation thanks to the great victory of the Soviet Union over the Third Reich, and was making great efforts to recover from the ruins left by fascism, victorious and inspiring news reached us: the great Chinese people, with brilliant heroism and selfless effort, broke through the long-term shackles imposed on them by imperialism. Then, an extremely powerful factor—People's China—appeared on the international stage. Together with the Soviet Union, People's China began to become the main link in the entire peace camp, a camp that, because of its goals and policies, has become the hope of the vast majority of humanity, which longs for peace and the relaxation of international tensions.

Just as we felt infinite joy in those days when China was liberated and People's China was born, today we warmly congratulate the achievements of the peace camp's policies. People's China, together with the Soviet Union, has played such an important role in this peace camp.

The agreements reached at the Geneva Conference on the restoration of peace in Indochina are a victory for all peace-loving people, a great victory for peace, and a great victory for the principle of consultation and the principle of peaceful coexistence between different systems over the forces of war and the plans of warmongers.

Therefore, our joy at Comrade Zhou Enlai's visit is twofold. We are happy both for the first visit of the Premier of People's China to Poland and for the creative, historically significant achievements in the struggle for peace.

Our government and the entire people will do their utmost to strengthen friendly ties with the Chinese people in all areas.

Comrade Premier, your visit to Poland will undoubtedly greatly contribute to the further development of the friendship and close cooperation between our two countries, and to strengthening the strength and unity of the peace camp—a camp that, under the leadership of the Soviet Union, is striving for the security of all countries and the easing of international tensions."

Premier Zhou Enlai said in his speech: "Respected Comrade Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Cyrankiewicz, dear comrades and friends,

I am very pleased and honored to have the opportunity to visit the Polish People's Republic after the Geneva Conference, to receive the warm welcome and hospitality of the Polish government, and now to be invited to a banquet by the Chairman of the Council of Ministers and to have the opportunity to meet with all comrades and friends. Please allow me to express my heartfelt thanks to you, respected Chairman of the Council of Ministers, and through you to the Polish government and people.

The Geneva Conference's agreements on the restoration of peace in Indochina not only stopped the Indochina war but also further eased international tensions. The conclusion of the agreements is a good example of resolving international disputes through peaceful consultation. It was achieved on the basis of respecting the national rights of the Indochinese people to independence, democracy, and unity. It is the result of the Indochinese people's years of struggle, and it is also the result of the common efforts of people all over the world, including the French people, to strive for peace.

The Polish government and people helped the Korean armistice through their participation in the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in Korea and the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission; now, they will participate in the Indochina International Commission to supervise the Indochina armistice. The Polish government and people have made a great contribution to maintaining peace in Asia. The Chinese government and people warmly support these peaceful efforts of the Polish government and people.

After the severe destruction of Poland by German fascists, the Polish people, under the leadership of the Polish United Workers' Party and its leader Comrade Bierut, have already become a socialist industrialized country through the early completion of the Three-Year Plan and the victorious realization of the Six-Year Plan. The remarkable achievements of the Polish people in socialist construction give the Chinese people great encouragement.

Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, Sino-Polish friendship has been developing day by day due to the close cooperation between China and Poland in political, economic, and cultural fields. I would like to particularly point out that in the cooperation between China and Poland, the Polish People's Republic, in the early stages of its own construction, used great strength to help the economic recovery and development of the newly born People's Republic of China. The Chinese people are deeply impressed by this. I hope that this visit to the Polish People's Republic will contribute to the continued development of the deep friendship and close cooperation between our two countries. I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the government of the Polish People's Republic, to you, Comrade Chairman, and to all the Polish people on behalf of the government and people of the People's Republic of China.

Long live the world peace forces headed by the Soviet Union!

Long live the friendly cooperation between China and Poland!"

The reception proceeded in a warm and friendly atmosphere and ended at 11:00 PM.

    当贝鲁特、西伦凯维兹和周恩来总理一起步入招待会大厅的时候，乐队奏起了中华人民共和国和波兰人民共和国国歌。
    招待会开始，波兰部长会议主席西伦凯维兹致欢迎词说：波兰人民共和国政府和波兰全体人民十分愉快地在我国的首都欢迎中华人民共和国中央人民政府政务院总理兼外交部部长周恩来。这是中国总理第一次访问波兰。我们对这件事感到极其高兴。波兰人民、特别是波兰工人阶级和一切进步的人们，许多年来一直抱着热烈的同情和信心注视着中国人民在中国共产党领导下进行的争取民族和社会解放的艰巨和英勇的斗争。
    当我国由于苏联对第三帝国的伟大胜利而从纳粹占领下得到解放以后、正在以巨大的努力从法西斯主义所留下的废墟恢复起来的时候，胜利的、令人欢欣鼓舞的消息传到了我们这里：伟大的中国人民以光辉的英雄主义和忘我的努力冲破帝国主义加在它身上的长期的桎梏。接着，一个极其强有力的因素——人民中国——在国际舞台上出现了，和苏联一起的人民中国，开始成为整个和平阵营的主要环节，这个阵营由于它的目的和它的政策，已成为渴望和平和缓和国际局势的人类的绝大多数的希望。
    正如在中国得到解放和人民中国诞生的那些时日里我们感觉无限喜悦一样，今天，我们热烈祝贺和平阵营的政策所得到的成就，在和平阵营中，和苏联一道的人民中国起了多么重要的作用。
    在日内瓦会议上达成的关于恢复印度支那和平的协议是所有爱好和平的人民的胜利，是和平的伟大胜利，也是协商的原则和不同制度和平共处的原则对战争力量和战争贩子的计划的伟大胜利。
    因此，我们因周恩来同志的访问而感到的高兴是双重的，我们既为人民中国的总理第一次访问波兰而感到高兴，也为争取和平的斗争中的创造性的具有历史意义的成就而感到高兴。
    我国政府和全国人民将尽他们的最大努力在各方面加强和中国人民的友好联系。
    总理同志，您的访问波兰无疑地将大大有助于我们两国的友谊和密切合作的进一步发展，有助于加强和平阵营的力量和团结——这个阵营正在苏联的领导下努力为各国的安全和国际局势的缓和而奋斗。
    周恩来总理致词说：敬爱的部长会议主席西伦凯维兹同志，亲爱的同志们和朋友们：
    我这次在日内瓦会议后，能获得机会访问波兰人民共和国，受到波兰政府的热烈欢迎和殷勤接待，现在又蒙部长会议主席设宴招待，并有机会和诸位同志和朋友见面，深深感到愉快和荣幸。请允许我向您，敬爱的部长会议主席，并通过您向波兰政府和人民表示衷心的感谢。
    日内瓦会议关于恢复印度支那和平的协议，不但使印度支那战争得以停止，并且进一步缓和了国际的紧张局势。协议的达成是以和平协商的方法解决国际争端的一个良好范例。它是在尊重印度支那人民的独立、民主、统一的民族权利的基础上达成的，是印度支那人民多年奋斗的结果，也是包括法国人民在内的全世界人民共同努力争取和平的结果。
    波兰政府和人民用参加朝鲜中立国监察委员会和中立国遣返委员会的行动帮助了朝鲜的停战；现在，又将参加印度支那国际委员会监察印度支那停战的工作。波兰政府和人民对于维护亚洲和平的贡献是巨大的。中国政府和人民热烈支持波兰政府和人民的这些和平努力。
    在德国法西斯严重破坏波兰后，人民的波兰在波兰统一工人党和它的领袖贝鲁特同志的领导下，经过三年计划提前的完成和六年计划正在胜利的实现，现在已成为社会主义工业化的国家了。波兰人民在社会主义建设上的显著成就即给了中国人民以莫大的鼓舞。
    自中华人民共和国建国以来，由于中波两国在政治、经济、文化各方面的密切合作，中波友谊正在日益发展中。我要特别指出，在中波两国的合作中，波兰人民共和国在它自己开始建设的初期，即用很大的力量来帮助刚刚诞生的中华人民共和国的经济恢复和发展，对此，中国人民印象很深。我希望这次访问波兰人民共和国，对于我们两国间深厚的友谊和密切的合作的继续向前发展，能够有所贡献。我借此机会代表中华人民共和国政府和人民，向波兰人民共和国政府，向您，主席同志，和向全波兰人民致敬。
    以苏联为首的世界和平力量万岁！
    中波友好合作万岁！
    招待会在热烈友好的气氛中进行，到晚间十一时结束。
