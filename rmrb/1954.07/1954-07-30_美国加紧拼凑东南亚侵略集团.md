Xinhua News Agency, July 28th: After its plot to sabotage the Geneva Conference on the question of Indochina was thwarted, the United States authorities are intensifying the pace of organizing a Southeast Asian military aggression bloc to obstruct further relaxation of tensions in Asia and prepare to launch new military adventures.

On the same day that the Geneva Conference agreements on restoring peace in Indochina were signed, U.S. President Eisenhower publicly announced at a press conference that the United States was "actively" discussing with its allies to "quickly" establish a so-called Southeast Asia Treaty, which is in fact a Southeast Asian military aggression bloc. The next day, the U.S. State Department announced that the United States was negotiating with its allies to get them to agree to hold a meeting immediately to develop a "detailed plan" for the establishment of the so-called Southeast Asia Treaty, i.e., the Southeast Asian military aggression bloc. According to Western news agencies, the U.S. plan is to hold this meeting in Washington or Manila in late August or early September, with participants including the United States, Britain, France, Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Thailand, and other countries. To coordinate with this conspiracy of the United States, U.S. senators and congressmen have also been clamoring to threaten their allies, demanding that they quickly join this military aggression bloc dictated by the United States. Senator Knowland hysterically clamored that now is the time to see which allies are "willing to stand with us." According to Reuters, sources in London revealed that, under pressure from the United States, Britain has agreed to hold a meeting to discuss the establishment of a Southeast Asian military aggression bloc. At the same time, news has revealed that the United States is also planning to draw the Colombo Conference countries into its aggressive bloc, or at least make them tacitly support such a bloc. According to UPI, the United States and Britain are considering having Britain invite the Colombo Conference countries to participate in the meeting to prepare for the Southeast Asia Treaty, and if these countries do not participate in the meeting, they should at least be "won over" to maintain "benevolent neutrality" toward this military bloc that creates antagonism in Asia, the so-called Southeast Asia Treaty. UPI said that this is actually demanding that the Colombo Conference countries "tacitly acknowledge the existence of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization."

The United States' echoing lackeys in the Philippines and Thailand have recently been waving flags and shouting to accelerate the organization of a military aggression bloc. According to the Associated Press, Philippine Vice President and Foreign Minister Garcia publicly stated on the 22nd that after the Geneva Conference reached an agreement to restore peace in Indochina, the United States and its allies should quickly strengthen their military aggression deployments in Asia. He demanded that the United States accelerate the organization of a Southeast Asian military aggression bloc and "strengthen its forces on military bases in the Philippines." After hearing about the signing of the agreement to restore peace in Indochina, Thai Ambassador to the United States Sarasin, following the U.S. will, impatiently demanded that the United States quickly convene a meeting to establish a Southeast Asian military bloc without further delay. He hysterically clamored that the "main thing" now is to "unite" and follow the United States.

These facts clearly show that the U.S. warmongering clique will never willingly give up due to its continuous failures in Asia. It is determined to be an enemy of Asian peace and security and is determined to create antagonistic military blocs in Asia to drag Asian countries into its war plans. Peace-loving Asian countries and people are clearly aware of these war plans of the U.S. warmongering clique and know how to deal with them.

    美国加紧拼凑东南亚侵略集团
    【新华社二十八日讯】美国当局在它破坏日内瓦会议关于印度支那问题的谈判的阴谋遭到失败以后，正在加紧步调组织东南亚军事侵略集团，来阻挠亚洲紧张局势的进一步缓和和准备发动新的军事冒险。
    在日内瓦会议关于恢复印度支那和平的协议签字的同一天，美国总统艾森豪威尔就在记者招待会上公开宣布，美国正在“积极地”和它的盟国进行讨论，以求“迅速地”成立所谓东南亚公约，其实就是东南亚军事侵略集团。在第二天，美国国务院又宣布，美国正在和它的盟国进行谈判，要它们同意立刻举行一次会议，制定成立所谓东南亚公约，即东南亚军事侵略集团的“详细计划”。据西方通讯社报道，美国的打算是，在八月下旬或九月上旬在华盛顿或马尼拉举行这个会议，参加会议的包括美国、英国、法国、澳大利亚、新西兰、菲律宾、泰国和其他一些国家。为了配合美国的这个阴谋，美国的参议员和众议员又大肆威胁他们的盟国，要它们迅速参加这个由美国来发号施令的军事侵略集团。参议员诺兰歇斯底里地叫嚣说，现在是看看哪些盟国“愿意跟我们站在一起”的时候了。据路透社报道，伦敦方面的人士透露，在美国的压力下，英国已经同意举行会议，来讨论成立东南亚军事侵略集团。同时有消息透露，美国还在打算把科伦坡会议国家也拉进它的侵略性集团，至少也要使它们对这样一个集团默认支持。据合众社报道，美英正考虑由英国邀请科伦坡会议国家参加筹组东南亚公约的会议，如果这些国家不参加会议，至少要“争取”它们对这个在亚洲制造对立的军事集团的所谓东南亚公约保持“善意的中立”，合众社说，这实际上就是要求科伦坡会议国家“默认东南亚公约组织的存在”。
    美国在菲律宾、泰国的应声虫，最近也摇旗呐喊，叫嚷要加紧组织军事侵略集团。据美联社报道，菲律宾副总统兼外交部长加西亚在二十二日公开表示，日内瓦会议取得恢复印度支那和平的协议以后，美国和它的盟国应该迅速加强它们在亚洲的军事侵略部署。他要求美国加速组织东南亚军事侵略集团，并且“加强它在菲律宾军事基地上的力量”。泰国驻美国的大使沙拉信在听到恢复印度支那和平的协议签字以后，就按照美国的意旨，急不及待地要求美国赶快召集一个建立东南亚军事集团的会议，不要再等下去。他歇斯底里地叫嚣说，现在“主要的事情”是“联合起来”，跟着美国走。
    这些事实清楚地说明，美国好战集团决不会由于它在亚洲接连不断地遭到失败而甘心罢休的。它坚决与亚洲和平和安全为敌，坚决要在亚洲制造对立的军事集团，把亚洲国家卷进它的战争计划里去。对美国好战集团的这种战争计划，主张和平共处的亚洲国家和人民是看得清楚的，是知道如何对付的。
