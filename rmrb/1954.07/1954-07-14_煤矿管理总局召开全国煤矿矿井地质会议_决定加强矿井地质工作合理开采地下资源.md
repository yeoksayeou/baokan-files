The Coal Mine Administration of the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government convened a National Coal Mine Geology Conference from June 27th to July 6th. The main task of the conference was to strengthen coal mine geology work, study how to rationally exploit underground resources under safe conditions in the future, and enable mines to develop normally.

In the past, coal mines across the country suffered many losses in production due to weak mine geology work and a poor understanding of geological conditions. Some mines were mistakenly abandoned because the amount of coal reserves was unclear. The phenomenon of coal loss and damage to coal seams during the production process is still serious, causing significant losses to national resources. On the other hand, the problem of tunneling not keeping up with mining has not been completely resolved for a long time due to a lack of understanding of the mine's geological conditions. At the same time, many difficulties have been brought to safe production because conditions such as water, fire, and gas cannot be accurately grasped.

At this conference, reports by Soviet experts on "The Basic Tasks of Mine Geology and Its Significance for Coalfield Exploitation" and "The Question of Hydrogeological Survey Methods When Conducting Coalfield Geological Exploration Work" were heard, enabling everyone to further recognize the importance of mine geology work to coalfield exploitation. At the same time, the methods of mine geology work were also initially resolved.

The conference also heard reports from mines in Jixi, Kailuan, Jingxing, Fengfeng, Huainan, and Pingxiang. Among them, the mine geology work experience of the Huainan Mining Bureau has been decided to be promoted in coal mines across the country.

In order to strengthen mine geology work, the conference decided that: major regional administrations, especially each mining bureau, should establish mine geology organizations before the end of July and begin work. In the third quarter, they should start to sort out and study existing data, continue to observe underground changes, and focus on solving prominent key problems. Before the end of the year, general mining bureaus should conduct research and judgment based on existing data and phenomenon records, identify unresolved problems, and propose future exploration plans and exploration designs. Supplementary exploration plans and exploration designs for mining areas should also be submitted before the end of the year. The conference also requested that mine geological boundaries be initially determined within this year, and the possible development of each mine should be studied. (Xinhua News Agency)

    煤矿管理总局召开全国煤矿矿井地质会议
    决定加强矿井地质工作合理开采地下资源
    中央人民政府燃料工业部煤矿管理总局在六月二十七日到七月六日召开了全国煤矿矿井地质会议。会议的主要任务是要加强煤矿矿井地质工作，研究今后怎样在安全的条件下，使地下资源能够合理地进行开采，并使矿井得到正常发展。
    全国煤矿的生产矿井过去因为矿井地质工作薄弱，地质情况了解很差，给生产带来许多损失。有些矿井曾因弄不清煤的埋藏量而错误地报废。生产过程中的丢煤现象和煤层遭受破坏的现象都还严重存在，使国家资源受到重大损失。另一方面，由于矿井的地质情况不了解，掘进赶不上回采的问题也长期得不到彻底解决。同时，由于水、火、瓦斯等情况不能正确掌握，也给安全生产带来了许多困难。
    这次会议听了苏联专家“关于矿井地质的基本任务及其对煤田开采的意义”、“关于进行煤田地质勘探工作时水文地质调查方法问题”等报告，使大家进一步认识到矿井地质工作对煤田开采的重要性。同时，也初步解决了矿井地质工作的方法。
    会议还听了鸡西、开滦、井陉、峰峰、淮南、萍乡等矿的汇报。其中，淮南矿务局的矿井地质工作经验已决定在全国煤矿推广。
    为了加强矿井地质工作，会议决定：各大区管理局，特别是各矿务局，要在七月底以前把矿井地质机构建立起来并开始工作。第三季度要着手整理、研究已有的资料，继续观察地下变化情况，着重解决突出的关键性问题。一般矿务局在年底前要根据已有的资料和现象纪录，进行研究、判断，找出不能解决的问题，并提出今后的探勘计划和探勘设计，井田补充探勘计划和探勘设计也要在年底前交出。会议还要求在今年年内初步确定矿井地质边界，研究各矿井可能发展的情况。（新华社）
