    Miners' Lives Secured
    By Our Correspondent Chen Weiren
      Walking west along the beach of Beidaihe's East Mountain, and bypassing a stretch of massive rocks and oases extending into the sea, you can see the buildings and water tower of the Chinese Coal Miners' Sanatorium, as well as rows of green fences.
        Not far from the beach along a convenient path, a vermilion-painted gate appears in the shade of the trees. Inside is a quiet courtyard, filled with flower beds. In the shade of the trees, convalescing miners in sky-blue uniforms stroll back and forth in small groups, some leaning against the fence gazing at the sea.
    In the office building of the sanatorium, I saw Dean Shen Shouyin. Wearing a faded gray cotton uniform with rolled-up sleeves, he was obviously busy with something. He looked cheerful and spoke frankly and sincerely. He told me that the sanatorium was officially established in 1952. At that time, it could only accommodate 150 people per session. This year, the site has more than doubled in size compared to the past, accommodating more than 450 convalescents per session, plus 50 therapists.
    Leaving the reception room, passing through the medical department's laboratory and X-ray room, we arrived at the dormitory building. In the corridors, female service staff in white uniforms were busy delivering water and wiping the floors.
    Dean Shen casually opened a door, and a gust of sea breeze rushed in, lifting the sky-blue curtains, revealing people active on the distant beach again. As soon as we entered, the recuperating miners—some from Fushun, others from Hegang, Jiawang—all sat up and greeted us warmly.
      "Comrades, enjoy yourselves! Let's take a look around and come back later," Dean Shen said with a smile, gently closing the door and walking with me onto the roof. This is a spacious open-air dance floor where convalescents can organize evening parties and dance group dances.
    In the corridor of another dormitory building, convalescing miners from Datong, Fengfeng, and Yangquan mines were either sitting in reclining chairs reading newspapers or gathered around rattan tables playing chess.
    Coming down from the dormitory building, we arrived at the model room. Here are displayed mining models of major mines, all electrically powered. Convalescents can learn a lot of new knowledge from them.
    Dean Shen said to me: "In the old society, the working conditions of miners were the worst, and their lives were the most miserable. It was simply not a human existence." He is fifty-four years old this year. He started working in the mines at the age of fourteen, and he worked in mines such as Liuhegou and Fengfeng. He worked hard, but his earnings often could not support himself. During that time, he went without a quilt for a full eight years. At that time, the mine owners believed that "the death of a miner is worth at most twenty-five yuan (referring to burial expenses), but the death of a donkey would result in a loss of one hundred yuan."
    When the convalescents had just woken up from their afternoon nap, I met Ma Liuhaizi, a national model worker, in a room on the second floor of the sanatorium facing the courtyard. He was wearing a white sanatorium uniform. On the bedside table were some newly picked cherry branches, as well as ripe red cherries. Talking about the draft constitution, Comrade Ma Liuhaizi said: "The draft constitution stipulates that labor is a glorious thing. In the past, labor was not a right, but a hard labor. I have worked for more than twenty years without a single day of rest, and my family didn't even have a mat on the earthen bed. Now, we have everything at home, including a radio, and even a large clock hanging on the wall!..."
    Ma Liuhaizi pointed to the badge of the accelerated middle school pinned on his clothes and said happily: "I am also in middle school now. It's no small matter for workers to go to school! Now, there are five students in my family of eight. The eldest child was only nine years old when he went down the mine with me to carry coal, but he also went to school after liberation."
    When the third group of convalescents arrived at the sanatorium, Ma Liuhaizi saw his nephew, Ma Fengjiu. This moved him greatly. He said: My nephew also started carrying coal with me when he was ten years old and is nineteen years old this year. He also suffered a lot in the old society.
    Chen Zongfa, from Yima Mine in Henan, talked to me about his thoughts after studying the draft constitution. He said: "In the past, not only was the labor of miners not protected by law, but even their lives had no security. I went down the well during the day and slept under the trees at night. At that time, low wages were not the only problem; the mine only paid 30% in cash, and the remaining 70% was paid in coal. But coal cannot be eaten and cannot be sold, so my family could only live from meal to meal. He worked there for four years without a day off, and even had to go into the water barefoot in the twelfth lunar month to mine coal; there was no ventilation equipment in the hot well, fires broke out everywhere, and many workers were suffocated and even lost their lives. The situation only fundamentally changed after the mine became a joint state-private enterprise. Now, there is no problem with the livelihood of my family of seven, and there is even surplus money every month. All three children are in school, and both my wife and I are model workers at the mine.” Wang Futing, an old comrade from Shuangya Mine in Northeast China, is already fifty-six years old this year. When he talked about the draft constitution, he recalled his experiences as a miner in Hegang before liberation: "At that time, we couldn't afford clothes in winter, so we wrapped ourselves in ragged sacks, and it was common to go without salt for three or four months; without salt, we couldn't work, and we would be beaten and scolded, and even lose our jobs." After liberation, Comrade Wang Futing was promoted to the director of the labor protection department of Shuangya Mine. In recent years, he has been continuously rated as a model worker. He deeply felt that miners' lives are secured, and their labor is respected by the country and the people.
    As I left this miner's home filled with love and warmth, the fourth group of convalescents was also about to return. The departing convalescents left enthusiastic letters to the sanatorium, expressing their gratitude to the people and the country.

### 矿工生活有了保障

    矿工生活有了保障
    本报记者　陈维仁
      我沿着北戴河东山的海滩西行，绕过一片延伸到海面的巨石和绿洲，就看到中国煤矿工人疗养院的楼房、水塔，以及一排排的绿色栅栏。
        从海滩沿着一条便道前行不远，林荫中出现一道朱红油漆的大门。里面是一个幽静的院落，到处布满花圃。树荫下，身着天蓝色衣服的休养员三三两两地来回踱着，有的依在栅栏边向海眺望。
    在疗养院的办公楼里，我看到了申守银院长。穿着一身褪了色的灰布制服，卷起衣袖，显然在忙着什么。他神色愉快，谈话时坦率、诚恳。他告诉我，疗养院是在一九五二年正式成立的。那时，每期只能容一百五十人。今年，院址比以往扩大了一倍以上，每期休养员达到四百五十多人，还有疗养员五十人。
    走出接待室，经过医务科的化验室、爱克斯光室，到了宿舍楼。走廊上，穿着白色工作服的女服务员们忙着送水、擦地板。
    申院长随手推开一间房门，一阵海风迎面拂来，掀起天蓝色的窗帏，看见远处海滩上又有人在活动了。我们一进门，在休养的矿工同志——有的来自抚顺，有的来自鹤岗、贾汪——全都欠起身来，亲切地招呼我们。
      “同志们，玩吧！咱们到处看看，回头再来。”申院长脸上堆满笑容，轻轻地带上门，和我走上屋顶。这是一个宽敞的露天舞场，休养员可以在这里组织晚会，跳集体舞。
    在另一个宿舍楼的走廊上，来自大同、峰峰、阳泉矿的休养员，有的坐在躺椅上看报，有的围着藤桌下棋。
    走下宿舍楼，到了模型室。这里陈列着各大矿山的采矿模型，全部是电动的。休养员们可以从里面学到不少新知识。
    申院长对我说：“在旧社会矿工的劳动条件最坏，生活最苦，那简直不是人过的日子。”他今年五十四岁。十四岁上他就开始下矿，六河沟，峰峰等矿他都呆过。他辛勤劳动，但所得往往养不活自己，其间他曾经整整八年没有盖过被子。那时，矿山的老板认为，“死一个矿工顶多二十五块钱（指埋葬费），死个驴就得损失一百元”。
    当休养员刚睡过午觉起来时，我在疗养院部面对着庭园的二楼一个房间里，见到了全国工业劳动模范马六孩。他穿着一身白色的疗养员服，床头几上，摆着一些新采回来的樱桃枝，还有熟透了的红樱桃。谈到宪法草案，马六孩同志说：“宪法草案规定劳动是光荣的事情，过去，劳动不是什么权利，而是苦役。我做了二十多年工，没有休息过一天，而全家土炕上连席子都没有。现在，家里什么都有了，还有收音机、墙上还挂上大钟呢！……”
    马六孩指着佩在衣服上的速成中学的校徽，高兴地说：“我也上了中学啦。工人上学校可不是小事！现在我一家八口人，就有五个读书的。大孩子九岁就跟我下矿背煤，解放后也上了学。”
    第三期休养员到院时，马六孩看到了他的亲侄子马逢九。这使他感动极了。他说：我这个侄子也是十岁上就跟我一块背煤，今年十九岁。他在旧社会也吃尽了苦头。
    从河南义马矿来的陈宗法，和我谈起学习宪法草案后的感想。他说：“过去，当矿工的不仅劳动谈不上受法律保护，连生命也没有啥保障。我白天下井，晚上就露宿在树下。那时候，工资低还不算，矿方只付给三成现钱，其余的七成就发煤；但煤炭不能吃，又卖不掉，一家大小就只能饥一顿饱
  一顿地过日子。他在那里一连工作了四年，没有歇过一天工，腊月间还得光着腿下水去采煤；热天井下没有通风设备，到处发火出危险，许多工人被熏倒，甚至白白送了性命。自矿山改为公私合营，情况才根本改变了。现在，我一家七口人，生活不成问题，每月还有余钱。三个孩子都上了学，我和我的妻子都是矿上的模范。”东北双鸭矿的王馥亭老同志，今年已经五十六岁了。一谈到宪法草案，他回忆起解放前他在鹤岗当矿工的情景：“那时候，冬天穿不上衣服，用破麻袋裹在身上，三、四个月吃不上盐是常事；不吃盐做不动活，又得挨打骂，甚至丢了工作。”解放后，王馥亭同志被提升为双鸭矿的劳保部部长。近几年来，他连续被评为模范。他深切地感到：矿工的生活有了保障，自己的劳动，受到了国家和人民的尊重。
    我离开这充满友爱和温暖的矿工之家时，第四期休养员也快回去了。快走的休养员们给疗养院留了热情洋溢的信，表示对人民和国家的感激。
