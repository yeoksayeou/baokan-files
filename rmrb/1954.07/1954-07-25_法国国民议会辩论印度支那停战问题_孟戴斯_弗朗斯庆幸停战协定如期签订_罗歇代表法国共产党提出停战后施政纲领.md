Xinhua News Agency, July 23rd—TASS, Paris, July 22nd: On July 22nd, the French National Assembly began discussing the Mendès-France government's policy on Indochina, based on the decisions of the Geneva Conference. Before the head of government spoke, National Assembly President Le Troquer delivered a brief speech.

Subsequently, Mendès-France took to the podium. He briefly described the last stage of the Geneva Conference and the agreements signed.

After Mendès-France's speech, discussion began on the results of the Geneva Conference and the government's policy towards Indochina.
Xinhua News Agency, July 24th—TASS, Paris, July 23rd: The French National Assembly is debating the Indochina armistice issue.

As previously reported, Prime Minister Mendès-France, upon returning from Geneva, reported to the members of parliament on the negotiation process and the conditions for the armistice in Indochina on the 22nd. Mendès-France emphasized the efforts made by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov to facilitate the successful completion of the Geneva negotiations, and also praised the work of British Foreign Secretary Eden. Mendès-France mentioned that the French expeditionary forces in Indochina had been in serious danger and rejoiced that the armistice agreement could be signed on schedule. He emphasized: "The current outcome is, without a doubt, the best we could have obtained under the current circumstances… The bloodshed will stop soon. This is the end of a nightmare."

Mendès-France pointed out: One of the results of the Indochina armistice is the "cessation of U.S. dollar aid." Therefore, France must reorganize its economy and expand exports.

Mendès-France pointed out that the United States was unwilling to participate in the final stages of the Geneva negotiations, and only after the Paris talks on July 13th and 14th did Dulles agree to send his Undersecretary of State to the Geneva Conference.

Subsequently, right-wing party members of parliament—de Bénouville and General Aumeran—who spoke in the debate, attacked the agreements signed in Geneva, believing that certain conditions were "unacceptable." Former Minister for Relations with Associated States, Édouard Frédéric-Dupont (former Gaullist), made a particularly fierce attack. He was one of those Frenchmen who had bet on continuing the Indochina War.

Charles Lussy (Socialist) and Gaston Palewski (Social Republican) approved of the Prime Minister's handling of the situation and hoped that the Geneva Conference would be the starting point for further easing of international tensions.

Progressive Republican Union member Deschamps emphasized that the majority of French people considered the agreements signed in Geneva to be glorious agreements. He said: "Unfortunately, the United States only wanted to internationalize the conflict, but did not express such enthusiasm for the internationalization of peace."

Deschamps spoke of the prospects that the results of the Geneva Conference opened up for France's economic, cultural, and political aspects, and particularly pointed out that negotiations must continue to peacefully resolve the European issue. He said: The Geneva Conference proved that it is possible to conduct successful negotiations. Efforts that have been effective in Asia should also begin in Europe in order to resolve the German question and ensure the security of France's borders.

On the afternoon of the 23rd, the debate continued. Communist parliamentarian Waldeck Rochet, in his speech, emphasized that the Indochina armistice was a victory for the cause of peace. On behalf of the Communist parliamentary group, he expressed satisfaction that the previous Laniel-Bidault government was forced to resign and was replaced by the Mendès-France government, which was committed to the Indochina armistice.

Rochet pointed out that the French Communist Party had, from the outset, striven to end the Vietnam War and to peacefully resolve the conflict through negotiations. He sharply criticized the position of the Popular Republican Movement, because representatives of this party had led French foreign policy for many years, thereby hindering the end of the Indochina conflict. He said that after the Mendès-France government came to power, the Popular Republican Movement still tried every possible means to obstruct the peace negotiations in Geneva, but the French people's will for peace overcame these activities.

Rochet went on to say that signing the armistice agreement does not mean that everything is fine. Now we must strive to establish a lasting peace and build friendly relations with the Vietnamese people. He explained the program that the Communist Party advocates for implementation after the end of the Indochina War. The main points of this program are: increasing wages and developing the national economy, reducing military spending and shortening the term of military service, increasing educational appropriations, expanding housing construction, and strengthening trade ties with all countries. This program can be realized if measures are taken aimed at ensuring the peaceful coexistence of two systems and further easing international tensions.

Rochet said: The Indochina War has stopped, but there are other issues waiting to be resolved: In Asia, the People's Republic of China must be recognized and its legitimate seat in the United Nations restored; in Europe, the ratification of the Paris Treaties and the arming of West Germany must be stopped. As long as everyone has the sincerity to negotiate, these issues can be successfully resolved. The Geneva Conference has taken a big step towards peace; but if we want to take another step, we should promote mutual understanding and peaceful coexistence among nations.

Former Foreign Minister Georges Bidault spoke. Because Bidault had led the French delegation to Geneva in the past and had refused to comment to the press on the Geneva Conference on July 21st, people listened to his speech with great interest. But his speech contained nothing new compared to his past attitude.

    法国国民议会辩论印度支那停战问题
    孟戴斯—弗朗斯庆幸停战协定如期签订
    罗歇代表法国共产党提出停战后施政纲领
   【新华社二十三日讯】塔斯社巴黎二十二日讯：七月二十二日，法国国民议会开始就日内瓦会议的决定讨论孟戴斯—弗朗斯政府在印度支那问题上的政策。在政府首脑发言之前，国民议会议长勒特罗盖发表了简短的演说。
    随后孟戴斯—弗朗斯走上讲台。他简略地述说了日内瓦会议的最后一个阶段的情形和所签订的协定。
    孟戴斯—弗朗斯发言后，开始讨论日内瓦会议的结果和政府对印度支那的政策。
   【新华社二十四日讯】据塔斯社巴黎二十三日讯：法国国民议会辩论印度支那停战问题。
    前已报道，从日内瓦回来的孟戴斯—弗朗斯总理在二十二日向议员们报告了谈判经过以及在印度支那停战的条件。孟戴斯—弗朗斯着重指出了苏联外交部部长莫洛托夫为促成日内瓦谈判的完满完成所作的努力，对英国外交大臣艾登的工作也作了好评。孟戴斯—弗朗斯提到法国在印度支那的远征军曾经处在严重的危险之下，并且庆幸停战协定能够如期签订。他着重指出：“目前的结局，毫无疑问，是我们在当前环境下所能获得的最好的结局……流血将在最近停止。这是一场恶梦的结束。”
    孟戴斯—弗朗斯指出：印度支那停战的结果之一，就是“美国的美元援助停止”。因此，法国要改组自己的经济，并且扩大出口。
    孟戴斯—弗朗斯指出：美国不愿意参加日内瓦谈判的最后阶段，只是在七月十三、十四日的巴黎会谈后，杜勒斯才同意派他的副国务卿出席日内瓦会议。
    接着在辩论中发言的右翼党派议员——德伯努维和奥麦朗将军——抨击在日内瓦签订的协定，认为有个别条件是“不能接受的”。前联邦成员国关系部部长爱德华·弗雷德里克—杜邦（前戴高乐派）作了特别激烈的抨击。他是那些把赌注押在继续印度支那战争上的法国人之一。
    夏尔·卢西（社会党）和加斯东·巴列夫斯基（社会共和党）赞成总理的处置，并且希望日内瓦会议成为进一步缓和国际局势的起点。
    进步共和联盟议员德香布兰着重指出：大部分法国人认为在日内瓦签订的协定是光荣的协定。他说：“遗憾的是：美国只想使冲突国际化，而对和平的国际化却没有表示这种热情。”
    德香布兰谈到了日内瓦会议的结果替法国的经济、文化和政治各方面打开的前途，并且特别指出：必须继续进行谈判，以便和平解决欧洲问题。他说：日内瓦会议证明，成功地进行谈判是有可能的。在亚洲获得成效的努力也应当在欧洲开始，以便解决德国问题和保障法国国境的安全。
    二十三日下午，辩论继续进行。共产党议员瓦德克·罗歇在发言中着重指出：印度支那停战是和平事业的胜利。他代表共产党议会党团，对前任拉尼埃—皮杜尔政府被迫辞职并由致力于印度支那停战的孟戴斯—弗朗斯政府来接替一事，表示满意。
    罗歇指出：法国共产党从一开头就为终止越南战争、为通过谈判和平解决冲突而努力。他对人民共和党的立场进行了尖锐的抨击，因为这个党的代表许多年来领导着法国的外交政策，从而阻碍了印度支那冲突的终止。他说，在孟戴斯—弗朗斯政府上台之后，人民共和党仍然千方百计地竭力阻挠日内瓦的和平谈判，但是法国人民要求和平的意志战胜了这些活动。
    罗歇接着说：签订了停战协定并不等于万事大吉。现在必须争取建立持久和平，建立和越南人民的友好关系。他说明了共产党主张在印度支那战争结束后实行的纲领。这个纲领的要点是：增加工资和发展国民经济，缩减军费和缩短兵役期限，增加教育拨款，扩大住宅建筑，加强和所有国家的贸易联系。如果采取其目的在保证两个制度和平共处和进一步缓和国际紧张局势的措施，这个纲领就可以实现。
    罗歇说：印度支那战争停止了，但是还有其他问题等着解决：在亚洲，必须承认中华人民共和国，并且恢复它在联合国的合法地位；在欧洲，制止批准巴黎条约和制止武装西德。只要大家有谈判的诚意，这些问题就能够成功地解决。日内瓦会议已经向和平迈进了一大步；但是，如果我们想再迈进一步，我们就应该促进在国际间的相互谅解与和平共处。
    前外交部长乔治·皮杜尔发言。因为皮杜尔过去领导过日内瓦的法国代表团，而且在七月二十一日拒绝向报界评论日内瓦会议，所以人们很感兴趣地听他发言。但是他的发言和他过去的态度相比，并无新的内容。
