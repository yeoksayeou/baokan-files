    After the resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party was issued, Party cadres at all levels have successively begun to study it and have examined their own thoughts, words, and actions in connection with reality. In this study, all thoughts and work styles within the Party that are not conducive to the Party's unity, especially the emotions of pride that have grown due to certain achievements in work, the individual prominence and individual worship arising from exaggerating the role of the individual, and even the erroneous tendencies of treating the departments and regions under one's leadership as personal capital and independent kingdoms, have been strictly exposed and criticized. This has educated cadres at all levels, especially senior Party cadres, to be more vigilant and clear-headed, and to strive to enhance Party unity. However, this does not mean that all shortcomings that undermine Party unity have been completely overcome, and that they will never happen again. In fact, not only have they not been completely overcome at present, but they may continue to occur in the future. Therefore, the entire Party must further study the resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session and continue to work hard to enhance Party unity.
    To constantly wage a struggle for the unity of one's own ranks is one of the basic characteristics of a Marxist-Leninist party. Contradictions within the Party are a reflection of social contradictions. Various major contradictions in social life tend to be reflected in the Party's life to varying degrees. This is also pointed out in the Fourth Plenary Session of the Party. Today, we are still adopting a policy of alliance with the bourgeoisie, and the petty bourgeoisie still surrounds us like a vast ocean. Their ideology and work style will inevitably infiltrate the Party through its weak parts, corroding and disintegrating the Party. This determines that the struggle to enhance Party unity is a major and regular political task for our entire Party.
    The study of the resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session by senior cadres has initially come to an end. Through this study, most senior cadres have deeply realized their significant responsibility for enhancing Party unity, and their awareness of safeguarding Party unity has been greatly enhanced. After examining their own thoughts, words, and actions based on the resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session, everyone has profoundly realized from many lessons, both large and small, that as senior Party cadres, they should set an example for the entire Party in abiding by Party discipline and organizational principles, implementing Party policies and resolutions, and safeguarding the prestige of the Party's leading organs. There should be no negligence or self-proclaimed special status. Because any negligence or error by senior Party cadres in these areas will cause greater losses than the mistakes of ordinary cadres. However, there are still a few senior cadres whose study of the resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session is not deep enough, whose exposure and criticism of their own shortcomings and errors are insufficient, and whose understanding of the great significance of enhancing Party unity remains inadequate. Therefore, the task of Party leading organs at all levels is to consolidate existing achievements and to help the few who have not studied well to continue learning and gradually improve their understanding.
    To consolidate the achievements of senior cadres in studying the resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session, the key lies in strictly enforcing the organizational life of senior cadres, so that all their words and actions are constantly supervised by the Party and the masses. Senior Party cadres have experienced many rectification and Party consolidation study movements, and have repeatedly criticized and reviewed the shortcomings in their ideological work style. Why do some people still have some relatively serious shortcomings and problems, and even make serious mistakes? The most important reason is that they have not been subjected to regular supervision and criticism by Party organizations and the masses of Party members. Many accidental errors and transgressions of an initial nature have gradually developed, and some people have even developed into serious errors because of this. In this study, many senior Party leading organs, in implementing the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session resolution, have stipulated that senior Party cadres must participate in Party organizational life like ordinary Party members and accept criticism and supervision from the branch and the masses of Party members. This regulation is very necessary. Grassroots organizations in various leading organs should conscientiously implement this regulation. Senior cadres should further promote a sense of awareness, not only participating in Party organizational life, but also conducting self-criticism well in various Party meetings; not only humbly accepting criticism from below, but also consciously cultivating a climate within their departments where people can criticize their leaders without any hesitation, and fostering a climate of warmly welcoming and resolutely protecting criticism. Only in this way can their words and actions be effectively subjected to the constant supervision of the Party and the masses, enabling them to constantly maintain the necessary clarity and vigilance, and to resolutely struggle against all words and actions that are not conducive to Party unity.
    Cadres at or above the county level in various localities have also begun to study the resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session. This is very necessary. Educating the entire Party to fully recognize the great significance of enhancing Party unity and to struggle against various undesirable tendencies that are not conducive to Party unity is a necessary task for enhancing Party unity. However, some cadres believe that the issues raised by the Fourth Plenary Session are specifically addressed to senior cadres, and they mistakenly believe that they can choose whether or not to study the documents of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Party. This understanding is, of course, wrong. The extremely dangerous emotions of complacency and individualism pointed out in the resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session not only exist among senior cadres, but also quite commonly among general cadres. The emotions of complacency and individualism among general cadres are also manifested in many aspects: some people become complacent after achieving some success in their work and no longer continue to humbly learn and improve themselves. Some people emphasize objective reasons when encountering difficulties in their work, and do not humbly examine their own shortcomings and mistakes, always feeling that they have been wronged, that their work assignment is inappropriate, and that their talents have been buried. Many people exaggerate the role of the individual, overestimate their own abilities, and often care about personal reputation, status, and material comforts. Some people, when praised, especially after being promoted to more important positions, become conceited, look down on others, do not approach the masses, and do not humbly listen to the opinions of the masses. Some people, in organizational life, also do not strictly abide by democratic centralism, are not bound by Party discipline, do not act according to Party policies, and do not abide by work systems and social order. Some people, when reporting to higher levels, often exaggerate their achievements and minimize their shortcomings and mistakes; they do not implement higher-level instructions very resolutely, emphasizing objective difficulties; and they not only do not rise up against words and actions that are not conducive to Party unity, but sometimes echo them. All these actions are not conducive to Party unity. Some people will say: "Yes, this is a slight emotion of individualistic pride, which is much less serious than those serious acts of individualism and splitting the Party and undermining the Party's independent kingdom!" This statement is extremely dangerous. Of course, these are just more general emotions of individualistic pride, or slight individualism. However, our Party never waits until individualistic errors develop to a serious degree, or even develop into independent kingdoms and individualistic careerists, before rising up to fight them. The Party cannot coexist peacefully with any individualism.
    Individualism is a reflection of the bourgeoisie's selfish, self-seeking, and self-serving ideology within the Party, and it is fundamentally incompatible with the working class's selfless collectivist ideology. The emergence of bourgeois individualistic ideology within the Party, regardless of its degree, will corrode and disintegrate the Party. At the same time, if individualistic ideology is not overcome in time, it will gradually develop. What is not serious today may become serious tomorrow, and may even develop into an individualistic careerist. Some comrades may ask: "I don't have this kind of individualistic thinking, do I still need to study and examine myself?" It is inappropriate for these comrades to easily conclude that they do not have individualistic thinking. They should first deeply and repeatedly examine themselves, and even for very slight individualistic thinking, they should dig it out and discard it. Even if their ideological consciousness is indeed relatively healthy, they should still study earnestly. When our Party is still in such a complex struggle environment, if any Party member thinks that his or her cultivation and training are already very good, and that he or she no longer needs to work hard to improve his or her awareness and enhance Party spirit training, and even that he or she does not need to study such important documents, this precisely shows that he or she has been infected with the disease of complacency, and then it will be difficult for him or her to resist the invasion of bourgeois ideology. Therefore, the study of the resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session should not only be carried out among senior cadres, but also among general cadres and the broad masses of Party members. Party organizations at all levels should not only continue to organize and lead senior cadres to study the documents of the Fourth Plenary Session in depth, but also treat the leadership of general cadres and ordinary Party members in studying the resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session as an important task. On the one hand, they should be good at using various typical events to remove ideological obstacles in everyone's study; on the other hand, they should guide everyone to examine their own thoughts and work in connection with reality at appropriate times, so that all Party members can take a step forward politically and ideologically through this study.
    At present, the entire Party and the people of the whole country are struggling to realize the Party's general line during the transition period. In 1953, the output value of my country's modern industry accounted for 31.6 percent of the total output value of industry and agriculture, of which the output value of state-owned industry increased by 33.7 percent compared with 1952. Agricultural production cooperatives have developed to more than 95,000, and handicraft production cooperatives have also made considerable progress. The planned purchase and planned supply of grain, oil, and other important materials are being expanded and implemented, and state capitalist enterprises are also developing. All this shows that the socialist factors in our country are growing rapidly, and the country's construction is advancing by leaps and bounds. The impact of all this is becoming increasingly profound in all aspects, and the problems it causes are also increasing. Precisely because of this, the Party must strengthen its leadership over national construction, and the entire Party must earnestly and deeply study the resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session, enhance Party unity, improve the Party's combat effectiveness and the exemplary role of Communist Party members, and unite the people of the whole country more closely to complete the arduous and glorious task of national socialist construction and socialist transformation.

### 进一步深入学习党的四中全会决议

    进一步深入学习党的四中全会决议
    党的七届四中全会决议发出以后，党的各级干部已先后开始进行学习，并联系检查了自己的思想、言论和行动。在这次学习中，对党内的一切不利于党的团结的思想作风，特别是由于工作获得若干成绩而滋长起来的骄傲情绪，由于夸大个人作用而产生的个人突出、个人崇拜，以至把自己所领导的部门和地区当成个人资本和独立王国等错误倾向，都进行了严格的揭发和批判，使各级干部、特别是党的高级干部受到教育而更加警惕起来和更加清醒起来，为增强党的团结而奋斗。但这决不是说损害党的团结的一切缺点已经完全克服了，今后再也不会发生了。实际上，不但目前没有完全克服，而且今后也还有可能继续发生。因此，全党必须进一步学习四中全会决议，继续努力增强党的团结。
    经常为自己队伍的团结而进行斗争，是马克思列宁主义政党的基本特征之一。党内矛盾是社会矛盾的反映。社会生活中的各种主要的矛盾往往会在党的生活中不同程度地反映出来。党的四中全会也是这样指出的。我们今天还采取着和资产阶级联合的政策，小资产阶级还像汪洋大海一样地包围着我们。他们的思想作风就一定通过党的薄弱部分而侵入到党内来，对党起腐蚀和瓦解作用。这就决定了为增强党的团结而奋斗是我们全党经常性的重大政治任务。
    高级干部对四中全会决议的学习已经初步告一段落。经过这次学习，大多数的高级干部都深深地体会到自己对于增强党的团结的重大责任，维护党的团结的自觉性大大地提高了。根据四中全会决议检查了自己的思想、言论和行动以后，从许多大大小小的教训中，大家都深刻地认识到，身为党的高级干部，在遵守党的纪律和党的组织原则、执行党的政策决议、维护党的领导机关的威信方面都应该成为全党的表率。而不应该有任何疏忽或自居特殊的现象。因为，党的高级干部在这些方面的任何疏忽或差错，都会比一般干部的错误造成更大的损失。但是目前也还有少数高级干部对四中全会决议的学习还不够深入，对自己缺点和错误暴露和批判得不够，对于增强党的团结的重大意义仍然认识不足。因此，各级党的领导机关的任务就在于巩固已有的成绩，并使少数学得不好的人在大家的帮助下继续学习，逐步提高认识。
    要巩固高级干部学习四中全会决议的成绩，关键在于严格高级干部的组织生活，使他们的一切言论和行动时时刻刻受到党和群众的监督。党的高级干部都经历过多次的整风整党的学习运动，对自己思想作风方面的缺点都曾反复地进行过批判和检讨，为什么在有些人身上仍然存在着一些比较严重的缺点和毛病，甚至发生了严重的错误呢？最重要的原因就是他们没有受到党组织和党员群众的经常的监督和批评，许多萌芽性质的偶然的差错和过失就逐渐发展起来，有的人甚至就因此而发展为严重的错误。在这次学习中，不少党的高级领导机关在贯彻四中全会决议的精神中，都规定了党的高级干部必须要和一般党员一样过党的组织生活，接受支部和党员群众的批评和监督。这一规定是十分必要的。各个领导机关中的基层组织应该认真地执行这一规定。高级干部更应该发挥自觉精神，不但要参加党的组织生活，并且要在党内的各种会议上很好地进行自我批评；不只是要虚心地接受自下而上的批评，还要有意识地在自己所领导的部门内培养那种向领导进行批评时毫无顾虑的风气，培养那种对批评采取热烈欢迎和坚决保护的风气。只有这样，才能使自己的言论和行动切实受到党和群众的经常监督，使自己经常保持应有的清醒和警惕，向一切不利于党的团结的言论和行动进行坚决的斗争。
    各地党的县一级以上的干部也已经开始学习四中全会决议。这是十分必要的。教育全党都充分认识到增强党的团结的重大意义，向不利于党的团结的各种不良倾向进行斗争，是增强党的团结的必要工作。但是，有些干部却以为四中全会所提出的问题是专对高级干部讲的，而且错误地认为党的四中全会的文件，他们可以学习也可以不学习。这种认识当然是错误的。四中全会决议所指出的极端危险的骄傲自满的个人主义的情绪，不但存在于高级干部中，也相当普遍地存在于一般干部中。在一般干部中骄傲自满的个人主义情绪也表现在很多方面：有的人在工作中有些成绩就沾沾自喜，不再继续虚心学习提高自己。有的人工作遇到困难就强调客观原因，不虚心检讨自己的缺点和错误，总觉得自己受了委曲，工作分配不当，埋没了自己的才能。不少人夸大个人的作用，过高地估计自己的能力，常常计较个人的名誉、地位和生活享受。有的人受到表扬时，特别是被提拔到比较重要的岗位以后，就自以为了不起，瞧不起别人，不接近群众，不虚心听取群众意见。有的人在组织生活中，同样不严格遵守民主集中制，不受党的纪律约束，不按党的政策办事，不遵守工作制度和社会秩序。有的人在向上级报告工作时，往往夸大成绩，缩小缺点和错误；他们对上级指示执行得很不坚决，强调客观困难；对于不利于党的团结的言论和行动，不但不起来反对，有时还会随声附和。他们的这些行动都是不利于党的团结的。有人会说：“是啊，这是轻微的个人主义的骄傲情绪，比起那些严重的个人主义和分裂党破坏党的独立王国行为，不是轻微得多吗！”这种说法是极端危险的。当然，这些都只是比较一般的个人主义骄傲情绪，或者是轻微的个人主义。但是，我们党在任何时候也不是要等到个人主义错误发展到严重的程度，甚至于发展到成为独立王国和个人主义野心家的时候才起来和它们斗争的。党是不能和任何个人主义和平共居的。
    个人主义是资产阶级的自私自利损人利己思想在党内的反映，它是和工人阶级的大公无私的集体主义思想根本不相容的。在党内出现了资产阶级个人主义思想，不管程度轻重，都会对党起腐蚀和瓦解作用。同时，个人主义思想如果不及时克服，就会逐渐发展起来，今天是不严重的，明天就可能严重起来，甚至可能发展成个人主义野心家。有些同志会问：“我没有这种个人主义思想，是否也要学习检查呢？”这些同志轻易地断定自己没有个人主义思想是不妥当的，而应该首先深入地反复地检查自己，对于那怕是很轻微的个人主义思想，也要挖掘出来把它抛弃。即或确实是思想意识比较健康，也还是应该认真学习的。当我们党还处在这样复杂的斗争环境中，任何一个党员，如果他以为自己的修养和锻炼已经很好，再也不需要努力提高觉悟和增强党性锻炼、甚至连这样重要的文件也不需要学习的话，这就恰恰说明他已经染上了骄傲自满的毛病，那末他就很难抵抗得住资产阶级思想的侵袭。因此，四中全会决议的学习不但应该在高级干部中进行，而且应该在一般干部和广大的党员群众中进行。各级党组织不只是应该继续组织和领导高级干部深入学习四中全会的文件，而且应该把领导一般干部和普通党员学习四中全会决议当作一件重要工作。一方面要善于通过各种典型事件来解除大家学习中的思想障碍；一方面要在适当时机引导大家联系检查自己的思想和工作，使全体党员通过这次学习都能从政治上思想上提高一步。
    目前，全党和全国人民正在为实现党在过渡时期的总路线而奋斗。一九五三年我国现代工业的产值已占工农业总产值的百分之三十一点六，其中国营工业产值比一九五二年增长百分之三十三点七，农业生产合作社已经发展到九万五千多个，手工业生产合作社也有了相当大的发展，粮食、油料及其他重要物资的计划收购和计划供应正在扩大地加以实施，国家资本主义企业也正在发展。这一切说明了我们国家的社会主义因素正在迅速增长，国家的建设事业正在突飞猛进。这一切在各方面所发生的影响正日益深刻，所引起的问题也日益增多。正因为这样，党就必须加强对国家建设的领导，全党就必须认真地深入地学习四中全会决议，增强党的团结，提高党的战斗力和共产党员的模范作用，更加紧密地团结全国人民，去完成国家社会主义建设和社会主义改造这个艰巨而光荣的任务。
