    Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region
    Plans to Purchase 14,000 Tons of Milk
    The more than fifty milk factories in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region began purchasing milk on the grasslands in early June. Trucks, horse-drawn carts, and camels carrying milk travel daily between cities and pastoral areas. This year, the region plans to purchase 14,000 tons of milk, an increase of 57 percent compared to last year's purchase volume. This milk will be processed into finished products such as milk powder, cream, lactose, and casein, to meet the needs of national industrial construction and people's lives. The area for milk purchasing this year has expanded from the scope of one banner in 1950 to four regions: Hulunbuir League, Jirem League, Xilingol League, and Ulanqab League. In order to facilitate the sale of milk by scattered herders, milk collection stations have been established in many places at the level of Baga (village), herder milk delivery groups have been organized, and contracts have been signed. Some factories also conduct purchases through local supply and marketing cooperatives.

    内蒙古自治区
    计划收购牛奶一万四千吨
    内蒙古自治区的五十多个牛奶工厂，六月初在草原上开始收购牛奶。装运牛奶的汽车、马车及骆驼等每天往来在城市和牧区之间。今年全区计划收购一万四千吨牛奶，比去年收购量增加了百分之五十七。这些牛奶将制成乳粉、奶油、乳糖及酪胶等成品，供应国家工业建设和人民生活的需要。今年收购牛奶的地区，由一九五零年一个旗的范围，已扩大到呼伦贝尔盟、哲里木盟、锡林郭勒盟、乌兰察布盟等四个地区。为了便利分散的牧民出售牛奶，在很多地方以巴嘎（村）为单位设立了牛奶收购站，组织了牧民送奶小组，并订立了合同，有的工厂还通过各地供销合作社进行收购。
