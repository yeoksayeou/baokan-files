Xinhua News Agency, 26th. After the Geneva Conference reached an agreement on the cessation of hostilities in Indochina, almost all countries, in their official and unofficial reactions, expressed welcome. However, Washington has continuously issued cries of dissatisfaction and new threats of aggression.

US Secretary of State Dulles, at a press conference in Washington on the 23rd, issued a statement on the Geneva Conference, reiterating that the US government dislikes the agreements reached at the Geneva Conference. Furthermore, it intends to accelerate the implementation of its aggressive and war-mongering policy of organizing opposing military blocs in Asia, including dragging the Indochinese countries into a Southeast Asian military bloc, to obstruct the implementation of the agreements on Indochina, permanently occupy Taiwan, and antagonize the Chinese people.

Dulles stated that the agreements reached at the Geneva Conference "contain many things that we (the United States) dislike." However, Dulles had to admit that some basic facts "dominated the Indochina portion of the Geneva Conference, leading to a solution," including the "precarious" military situation of the colonial forces in Indochina and "the unwillingness of the French people to prolong the war."

However, Dulles immediately made it clear that the American warmongers are not willing to accept this reality. Dulles stated that the United States "was not a party to the conference results." Moreover, although Dulles pretended to say that the United States will "not seek to overthrow this solution by force," he then indicated that the US government has decided to disregard the provisions in the Geneva Conference agreement regarding not including the Indochinese countries in any opposing military blocs. Dulles emphasized in his statement that the United States would "take prompt steps" to establish a Southeast Asian aggressive bloc. In answering reporters' questions, Dulles openly stated that the United States would include Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam in the scope of this Southeast Asian military aggression bloc being planned by the United States. He specifically pointed out that Cambodia could participate in this treaty.

Dulles expressed the US's arrogant attempt to occupy China's territory of Taiwan for a long time, believing that, as a "long-term" plan, the United States should also include Taiwan in the military bloc it is planning.

Just as the people of Asia and the world are eagerly anticipating that the agreements of the Geneva Conference will lead to the national independence and unity of the Indochinese countries and open up favorable prospects for Asian peace and collective security, the highest responsible authorities of the US government have repeatedly come out to declare that the United States is not bound by the agreements and will accelerate the implementation of its plan to establish opposing blocs of countries. This shows that after the failure of obstruction at the Geneva Conference, the US is still stubbornly trying to undermine the foundation for achieving a stable ceasefire in Indochina, prevent these countries from becoming truly independent and unified nations, and create new tensions in Asia. This conspiracy of the United States to undermine the Geneva Conference agreements and threaten Asian peace must be given serious attention by all those who are concerned about implementing the Geneva Conference agreements and maintaining peace in the Far East and the world. As for the Chinese people, they will be particularly vigilant about these arrangements by the US imperialist war forces that seriously threaten their security, and will never forget the fact that it forcibly occupies Taiwan and constantly carries out intrusions against our country from there. We must completely liberate Taiwan.

### 杜勒斯发表声明表示  美国不喜欢日内瓦会议的协议  企图把印度支那三国拖入军事集团

    杜勒斯发表声明表示
    美国不喜欢日内瓦会议的协议
    企图把印度支那三国拖入军事集团
   【新华社二十六日讯】在日内瓦会议就停止印度支那敌对行动问题取得协议后，差不多所有的国家，在它们官方和非官方的反应中都表示欢迎，但是从华盛顿却接连不断发出不满的呼声和新的侵略威胁。
    美国国务卿杜勒斯二十三日在华盛顿记者招待会上发表关于日内瓦会议的声明，再次表明美国政府不喜欢日内瓦会议达成的协议，而且要加速在亚洲推行组织对立的军事集团的侵略和战争政策，包括把印度支那的国家拖入东南亚军事集团，来阻挠关于印度支那的协议的实现和长期占领台湾，与中国人民为敌。
    杜勒斯在声明中说日内瓦会议达成的协议“包含着许多我们（美国）所不喜欢的东西”。但是，杜勒斯却不能不承认，有着一些基本事实“支配了日内瓦会议的印度支那部分，导致了达成解决办法”，其中包括殖民势力在印度支那军事形势的“岌岌可危”以及“法国人民不愿把战争延长下去”。
    但是杜勒斯随即表明，美国好战分子并不甘心接受这种事实。杜勒斯声明美国“没有与会议结果发生关系”。而且，虽然杜勒斯也装模作样地说，美国将“不设法以武力来推翻这个解决办法”，但接着他就表明美国政府已决定不顾日内瓦会议协定中关于不使印度支那国家包括进任何对立的军事集团的规定。杜勒斯在声明中强调美国要“采取迅速的步骤”来建立东南亚侵略集团。杜勒斯在答复记者问题中公然表示，美国将把柬埔寨、老挝和越南国划入美国策划中的这个东南亚军事侵略集团条约范围。他并且特别指明说，柬埔寨能够参加这个条约。
    杜勒斯表示了美国想长期占领我国领土台湾的狂妄企图，他认为，作为“长久的”打算，美国要把台湾也包括进它策划中的军事集团里去。
    正当亚洲和世界各国人民都热烈地期待着日内瓦会议的协议将导向印度支那国家的民族独立和统
  一并为亚洲和平和集体安全展开有利前景的时候，美国政府最高负责当局一再出来声明美国不受协议约束并将加速推行其成立对立国家集团的计划，说明美国在日内瓦会议上阻挠失败之后，仍顽固地竭力要用各种方法来破坏印度支那获得稳定的停战的基础，阻止这些国家成为真正独立和统一的国家并在亚洲制造新的紧张局势。美国这种破坏日内瓦会议协议和威胁亚洲和平的阴谋，必须提起一切关心贯彻日内瓦会议协议、关心维护远东及世界和平的人们的严重注意。至于中国人民，他们将格外警惕美帝国主义战争势力这些严重威胁其安全的安排，并一刻也不会忘记它强占着台湾并从那里不断对我国进行侵袭的事实，我们一定要完全解放台湾。
