Based on the resolution of the joint expanded meeting of the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the Standing Committee of the Chinese People's Anti-American Aid Korea General Association on February 5, 1954, the National People's Delegation to Comfort the People's Liberation Army was established, with Dong Biwu appointed as the head of the delegation and Chen Shutong, Teng Daiyuan, Zhang Dingcheng, Peng Zemin, Mao Dun, Liao Chengzhi, Liang Xi, Jiang Guangnai, Deng Yingchao, Ulanhu, Li Zhuchen, Shi Liang, Gao Chongmin, Wang Congwu, Xie Youfa, Cai Shufan, He Changgong, Tan Yubao, Zhang Qilong, Zhang Youyu, Xu Guangping, Yuan Renyuan, Li Zaiwen, Zhang Su, Huang Songling, Yang Mingxuan, Mei Lanfang, and Hu Keshi as deputy heads.

The delegation's organization included, in addition to the main delegation, a general sub-delegation in each major administrative region and for the Chinese People's Volunteers, and a directly affiliated general sub-delegation composed of representatives from central and Beijing municipal agencies and parts of North China, totaling eight general sub-delegations. The delegation included representatives from various democratic parties, all sectors, all ethnic groups, various government departments, the Chinese People's Volunteers, and industrial and agricultural labor models, families of martyrs, families of military personnel, women, and children, totaling approximately 5,000 people. In addition, more than 300 theatrical troupes, acrobatic troupes, and many film projection teams, totaling more than 17,000 people, were mobilized to participate in the comfort work (including all theatrical genres in our country).

The comfort work, in addition to the general delegation and various general sub-delegations organizing representatives and theatrical troupes to go to several key areas for comfort, also adopted the method of on-the-spot comfort, with the general sub-delegations of major administrative regions responsible for comforting the leading organs and troops of major military regions. Each general sub-delegation was further divided into several sub-delegations to comfort the garrisons in various provinces and cities, and the directly affiliated general sub-delegation comforted the various organs of the Central People's Government People's Revolutionary Military Commission stationed in Beijing. The general delegation directly organized 113 representatives and eight theatrical troupes, divided into seven routes. The Volunteer Army general sub-delegation was also correspondingly divided into seven routes, combined with the East China, Central South, Southwest, and Northwest general sub-delegations, to go to Shandong, Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong, Yunnan, Kangzang, Xinjiang and other coastal and border defense areas to carry out comfort activities. Since the general delegation held a comfort conference for the Military Commission in Beijing on February 20, various places have successively started comfort activities. Generally, those who provided on-the-spot comfort in various provinces and cities ended in about 20 days; however, those who went to the border and coastal defense areas extended their activities by one to two months due to the long distances, inconvenient transportation, scattered troop deployments, and more in-depth and meticulous comfort. The comfort work in Xinjiang and Yunnan ended in May. The comfort delegation held comfort conferences, symposiums, and hero model report meetings in the Army, Navy, Air Force, engineering construction troops, military hospitals, revolutionary disabled soldiers' sanatoriums, revolutionary disabled soldiers' schools, and military farms and ranches. They conducted individual visits and paid respects and laid wreaths at martyrs' cemeteries. Some also visited cadres collectively transferred from the military to industrial and mining enterprises, visited local party and government organs and transferred cadres, and held symposiums for families of martyrs and families of military personnel. This comfort effort, with the exception of the entire Tibetan region and a few dispersed garrisons that were not visited due to transportation difficulties, and a small number of people on scattered duty or away from their posts, generally all troops were comforted or saw comfort performances.

Since the liberation of the mainland, the People's Liberation Army, in addition to actively suppressing the remaining bandits, has resolutely consolidated coastal and border defenses, strictly guarded combat posts, and guarded against imperialist aggression. They have also conducted large-scale military, political, and cultural training, greatly improving the quality of the troops. They have also resolutely carried out the tasks of work teams, participated in the construction of the motherland, and strengthened the relationship between the military and the people. Therefore, the people of the whole country warmly supported the activities of comforting the People's Liberation Army and gave great support to the comfort delegation. When the comfort delegation arrived in the border and coastal defense areas, they were welcomed by large-scale and grand events by people of all ethnic groups and all walks of life. The high patriotic enthusiasm of the people of the motherland gave us infinite encouragement and urged us to be determined to complete the glorious comfort task given by the people of the whole country.

The troops have conducted ideological education on the issue of welcoming the comfort delegation in accordance with the instructions of the General Political Department of the Military Commission, emphasizing that this comfort is seen as the meticulous care of the people and the government for the army, an important measure to strengthen the close unity of the people, the government, and the army, and a vivid education on socialism and patriotism for the army in general. Therefore, the news of the organization of the comfort delegation made the troops very excited. Soldiers on sentry duty on the Pamir Plateau looked north with binoculars every day to see if the comfort delegation was coming. Some soldiers shouted in their dreams: "The loved ones are here!" The troops made full preparations for welcoming the comfort delegation, organized special reception personnel, and solved problems such as transportation and accommodation. The party and government organs and mass organizations stationed in the various military garrisons also gave us many concrete help.

During the comfort activities, the general approach adopted was a combination of universal comfort and in-depth focus (combining comfort conferences with in-depth visits to various units). At the same time, some representatives reported to the troops on the general line and the situation of industrial and agricultural construction, and representatives of the Volunteer Army reported on the victory of the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea. The deputy heads of the general delegation who went to the coastal and border defense areas for comfort, including Huang Songling (to the coastal areas of Shandong), Chen Shutong and Xie Youfa (to the Zhoushan Islands area of Zhejiang), Mao Dun and He Changgong (to the coastal areas of Fujian), Teng Daiyuan, Jiang Guangnai, Tan Yubao, Mei Lanfang, and Hu Keshi (to Guangzhou and Hainan Island), Shi Liang and Li Zaiwen (to Sichuan and the Kangzang Highway), Wang Congwu and Cai Shufan (to the Yunnan border), Xu Guangping, Yuan Renyuan, and Yang Mingxuan (to various parts of Xinjiang), Liang Xi and Zhang Qilong (to the Northeast), were all tireless, traveled long distances, and personally met with the troops and soldiers. Representatives and members of the art troupes competed to wash and mend clothes for the soldiers, and help the cooks make meals when visiting the companies and hospitals, and revolutionary disabled soldiers' schools. Some also went to sentry posts, stables, pastures, and other places to comfort sentries and staff. Many elderly and women comrades among the representatives also climbed mountains and waded through rivers to comfort troops on islands or border defenses. During this comfort effort, the general theatrical troupes and film projection teams showed enthusiasm and hardship, and displayed a high degree of selfless labor, trying their best to meet the needs of the troops and striving to enrich the performance programs. They also helped the troops' art troupes improve their artistic skills and also learned many things from the troops. Before the performance, the theatrical troupe beat gongs and drums at the venue to welcome the troops to the venue. After the performance, the actors jumped off the stage without removing their makeup and shook hands and hugged the troops. Many actors performed several shows a day, or walked a long distance every day, but still insisted on performing. Some actresses insisted on performing despite being pregnant or sick. The actors who went to the Kangzang area for comfort performed while inhaling specially prepared oxygen due to the thin air of the plateau, and some theatrical troupes performed in the wind, snow, or rain. Deputy Head of the Delegation Mei Lanfang and many famous actors personally went to the hospital wards to sing for the wounded and sick, or to the company's cooking classes to sing for the cooks. These enthusiastic scenes often moved both sides to tears.

This general comfort work gave the troops great encouragement, enhanced the troops' fighting will, enhanced the troops' sense of honor, and enhanced the troops' unity and consolidation. Generally, after the comfort, the comrades in the troops felt that it was very honorable to be a soldier of the people. The troops unanimously expressed their gratitude to the people of the motherland and Chairman Mao for their concern, especially the troops in the border and coastal defense areas, who were even more excited and grateful. Some soldiers in the Xinjiang border defense troops said: "When a son travels thousands of miles, his mother worries. The people of the motherland and Chairman Mao care for us like parents." The soldiers stationed in Altay, Xinjiang, composed such a song: "The water of the Kelang River is clear and clear, and Altay is closely connected to Beijing." When a certain coastal defense unit in East China said goodbye to the representatives of the comfort delegation, a comrade was very excited, with tears in his eyes, picked up a small stone from the ground and said to the representative: "Please tell the people of the motherland and Chairman Mao that we are determined to defend the coastal defense of the motherland. Everything in the motherland, even this small stone, will not be taken away by the enemy." A soldier from a certain unit of the Shandong coastal defense climbed to the machine gun bunker and said to the representative: "When the motherland needs me, I can learn from the spirit of Huang Jiguang and use my own flesh and blood to defend the motherland." The troops building the Kangzang Highway expressed their determination to the comfort delegation: We must build the highway to Lhasa. Some soldiers hid the commemorative medals given to them by the comfort delegation, saying that they would wear them only after they had made meritorious service. This time, the various general sub-delegations received tens of thousands of letters from soldiers expressing their determination and gratitude. This comfort also strengthened the mutual encouragement and mutual learning between the People's Liberation Army and the Volunteer Army. When the representatives and art troupes of the Volunteer Army separately comforted important border and coastal defense troops and other troops, the hero models from both sides met and had cordial conversations. The People's Liberation Army troops listened to the report of the Volunteer Army's victory in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea; the Volunteer Army also personally saw the extremely difficult conditions of the troops in the border and coastal areas, saw the cultural learning and regularized military training achievements of the domestic troops, and saw the enthusiastic labor of the engineering construction troops. This greatly enhanced the close unity between the two sides. Zhang Guorui, the management section chief of a certain unit of the Shandong coastal defense troops, dedicated a poem to the representatives of the Volunteer Army: "Volunteer Army, People's Liberation Army, the roots are one, the hearts are one; you fight the American devils in Korea, I watch the gate in the motherland, with you and me in the motherland, we can build with peace of mind." This poem is enough to express the close unity of the People's Liberation Army and the Volunteer Army and their determination to defend the motherland.

This comfort enhanced the troops' socialist thought and their will to defend the construction of the motherland, promoted the troops' current work, and enhanced the troops' determination and confidence to strive to build a modern national defense force. The period of comfort was when the troops began to study the general line. The representatives of the East China General Sub-Delegation reported to the troops that Shanghai's total industrial output value had increased threefold in the past four years, which made the soldiers particularly excited. Tian Yingrong, a military family labor model from Guangxi Province, introduced his deeds to the troops, saying: "In the old society, I had nothing to eat. Last year, I was able to sell 1,600 kilograms of grain to the state. At that time, many soldiers wrote letters to their families to mobilize them to sell grain, but my lover never wrote a letter. I was very angry in my heart. I thought that if he didn't mobilize me, I would mobilize him. After selling the grain, I wrote a letter to him, proposing a competition, hoping that he would make meritorious service in the front." These words gave the soldiers great encouragement and education. Many people, after being comforted, automatically subscribed to national economic construction bonds. Many people sent the notes of the representatives' reports home, mobilizing their families to sell grain and participate in agricultural production cooperatives. A comrade from a certain guard unit of the East China Navy dedicated a poem to the comfort delegation after listening to the representatives' report: "Just for the sake of the modern factories standing tall, just for the sake of the tractors about to embrace the land of the motherland, I resolutely stand here. Even if there is only one enemy left in the world, I cannot easily lay down my arms; if the motherland needs me to give my life, I will not hesitate." The improvement of the troops' socialist thought is more specifically reflected in the fact that the comfort activities promoted the troops' current work. The slogan of the troops welcoming the comfort delegation was "Improve learning achievements to welcome loved ones." The soldiers of a certain barracks building unit automatically proposed "Welcome the comfort delegation, carry two more bricks." During the comfort activities, many units saw exemplary cases of improved work efficiency, early completion of tasks, wounded and sick asking to be discharged early, and improved target shooting results. Many revolutionary disabled soldiers expressed to the comfort delegation: Although our bodies are disabled, our minds are not. We must study hard and participate in the construction of the motherland in the future.

This comfort work strengthened the relationship between the army and the people and the government. During the comfort, the contact between the troops and many labor models, especially the representatives of the families of martyrs and military personnel, and listening to the reports of party and government cadres, further understood the national political and economic construction situation, which further enhanced the troops' mass concept. Many moving scenes occurred in the contact between the troops and the people's representatives: Jiang Taizhen, a meritorious member of the Henan Military Region, was moved after listening to the report of Wang Xiuluan, an old lady representative of the Henan Sub-Delegation (her three sons participated in the revolutionary army, the eldest son has been sacrificed, and she herself is a labor model), and said: "Because I have no parents, I have nowhere to send the good news of my two meritorious services. Today, after listening to the report of Wang's old lady, the more I listened, the more she looked like my mother. I want to dedicate these two meritorious service reports to Wang's mother. She is my mother." When labor model Li Tianying presented a commemorative medal to soldier Yang Falu in the East China Military Region, he said: "Without you, there would be no labor models like us!" Comrade Yang Falu replied: "Without the people, there would be no People's Liberation Army." The troops uniformly called the representatives of the comfort delegation "loved ones". The house where the representatives lived was called "loved ones' dormitory", and the pine gate tied by the troops was written with "Welcome loved ones' gate". After the representatives arrived in the troops, they encountered indescribable warm welcomes and meticulous receptions, which greatly moved the representatives. Many representatives said: "This is not us coming to comfort the troops, but the troops comforting us. The entire comfort activity was filled with a warm atmosphere of military-civilian unity."

This large-scale comfort to the border areas greatly encouraged the people of all ethnic groups in the border areas and further promoted the close unity between the border troops and the people of all ethnic groups. In the comfort activities, leading figures of local ethnic minorities were absorbed to participate in the comfort work, and special comfort was also given to the local ethnic minorities. Many ethnic minority masses reflected that the central government's emphasis on the People's Liberation Army guarding the border is an emphasis on and love for the people of our border areas. At the same time, we also deeply realized that the People's Liberation Army has won the heartfelt support of the people of all ethnic groups due to its correct implementation of the party's ethnic policy and strict adherence to mass discipline. The troops are very strict in observing the customs of ethnic minorities. When entertaining the comfort delegation this time, they took good care of the representatives of the Hui people, and the words "Halal" were written on the tableware. Last year, the Yunnan border defense troops helped the masses kill 200,000 catties of pests and more than 317,000 wild animals such as jackals, wolves, tigers, leopards, bears, and monkeys. Last year, the Xinjiang troops handed over more than 410,000 mu of land that they had reclaimed and sown to the people of all ethnic groups. The spirit of the People's Liberation Army serving the people of all ethnic groups deeply moved the people of all ethnic minorities. The Miao people composed a song saying: "The earth moves, we don't move, the mountains shake, we don't shake, we will always follow the Communist Party, and we will always support the People's Liberation Army." This song expresses the love of the ethnic minorities for the People's Liberation Army.

The comfort work also gave the representatives of the comfort delegation a very profound and vivid education. In the comfort work, we deeply recognized and experienced the People's Liberation Army's fine traditions and noble qualities of hard work, heroic sacrifice, close unity, observance of discipline, overcoming difficulties, and perseverance. When we went to the coastal and border defense areas for comfort, we saw that some coastal defense troops patrolled day and night on uninhabited islands, monitoring the enemy, and had to fight against strong winds and waves, and be vigilant against poisonous snakes and beasts at any time. On some border defense lines, the troops were dispersed to perform guard duties, and it took a month for the provincial newspaper to reach the company; in some places, there was no green vegetables to eat all year round, and in some places, they had to fight against natural difficulties such as mosquitoes, malaria, miasma, and humidity. The troops building the Kangzang Highway have lived in tents for more than three years; when the mountains were blocked by heavy snow and food was scarce, the soldiers composed a song: "If there is rice, eat dry rice, if there is little rice, eat porridge, whether you eat or not, work will continue." This spirit of revolutionary optimism moved the representatives to unanimously believe that the People's Liberation Army comrades are truly worthy of being the most beloved people. The speed of the troops' learning progress deeply impressed many representatives of the education sector. For example, many comrades from working-class and peasant backgrounds, after being trained by the troops, can now master complex modern military technology and can drive airplanes and tanks; many soldiers were illiterate or semi-illiterate when they joined the army, and after a year of study, they reached the level of graduating from elementary school or above. In the comfort work, the troops' cadres and hero models also introduced to us their revolutionary heroic deeds, such as marching into the border areas to wipe out the remaining bandits, strictly guarding national defense, and fiercely attacking enemies invading our seas and skies; opening up and building roads on cliffs and snow-capped mountains and grasslands; building many large-scale water conservancy projects on the Gobi Desert, reclaiming thousands of acres of fertile land, and establishing many mechanized farms and modern factories, and many new industrial and agricultural towns have emerged. Many troops fought tigers and leopards to eliminate harm for the people, helped the people with labor, treated diseases and rescued disasters, and the navy protected fishermen's fishing. Many troops also participated in the construction of the country's mining, railways, forestry, water conservancy, and construction projects. The hard work of the People's Liberation Army deeply educated and moved the members of the comfort delegation. Some troops also performed airplane and tank performances for the comfort delegation, and some representatives visited live ammunition combat exercises, and some visited various military exhibitions of the troops, which greatly enhanced the representatives' confidence in building a strong modern national defense force.

In short, this comfort work has basically completed the task given to us by the people of the whole country, and has been of great educational significance to the troops and the representatives. The reason why this comfort work can successfully complete the task is mainly due to the correct leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the Anti-American Aid Korea General Association, and also due to the strong support and specific help of the party committees at all levels, the people's governments at all levels, and various mass organizations, especially the leading organs at all levels of the troops; the efforts of all the representatives and all the members of the theatrical troupes of the comfort delegation are also an important guarantee for the completion of the comfort task. The most important problem in the work is that the time to organize the comfort delegation was rushed, so the preparation was not sufficient; in addition, due to time and transportation conditions, some remote national defense troops and production troops (such as animal husbandry, logging, etc.) were not all comforted. Also, because the comfort schedule was generally too tight, more forms of comfort conferences were adopted, and there were too few opportunities to go deep into the company and meet with soldiers to talk. Also, due to the urgency of time, the troops often prepared some reports of hero models, but the representatives of the comfort delegation did not have time to listen, and the exhibitions prepared by the troops did not have time to see carefully.

After the end of the comfort work, we have notified the various general sub-delegations to conduct publicity reports on this comfort work in the areas, factories, and organs where the representatives are located in the form of small-scale forums and report meetings, focusing on publicizing the hard work of the People's Liberation Army, and can also conduct publicity through newspapers and radio. The various general sub-delegations have carried out such publicity work in general due to the different times of completion.

The various general sub-delegations unanimously felt in their summary work that this kind of comfort activity has a great effect on strengthening the unity between the military and the people and the military and the government, and it is also very encouraging to the troops. It is hoped that comfort can still be carried out in the future at a certain period. In addition, from this comfort, it is felt that the People's Liberation Army's arduous and selfless struggle, collective heroism, and the noble qualities of serving the people wholeheartedly should be publicized more among the people, which is very helpful for improving the people's production and labor enthusiasm and patriotic thought.

    全国人民慰问人民解放军代表团工作总结报告
      一九五四年二月五日中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会常务委员会与中国人民抗美援朝总会常务委员会联席扩大会议决议，成立全国人民慰问人民解放军代表团，并推定董必武为总团长，陈叔通、滕代远、张鼎丞、彭泽民、茅盾、廖承志、梁希、蒋光鼐、邓颖超、乌兰夫、李烛尘、史良、高崇民、王从吾、谢有法、蔡树藩、何长工、谭余保、张启龙、张友渔、许广平、袁任远、栗再温、张苏、黄松龄、杨明轩、梅兰芳、胡克实等为副总团长。
    慰问团的组织除总团外，各大行政区和中国人民志愿军各组一个总分团，中央和北京市各机关以及华北部分代表共组成一个直属总分团，共八个总分团。代表团包括了各民主党派、各界、各民族、政府各机关部门、中国人民志愿军和工业、农业劳动模范、烈属、军属、妇女、少年儿童等的代表，共约五千多人。另外还动员了三百多个剧团、杂技团等和许多电影放映队，共一万七千多人参加慰问工作（包括有我国所有的剧种）。
    慰问工作除由总团与各总分团组织代表和剧团分赴若干重点地区进行慰问外，并采用了就地慰问的方式，由各大行政区的总分团负责慰问各大军区领导机关、部队，各总分团下面又分成若干分团，分别慰问各省、市驻军，直属总分团慰问驻北京的中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会各机关。总团直接组织了一百一十三位代表，八个剧团，分为七路，志愿军总分团也相应地分为七路，共同与华东、中南、西南、西北等总分团结合，分别去山东、浙江、福建、广东、云南、康藏、新疆等海防、边防等地区进行慰问。自二月二十日总团在北京举行了慰问军委大会之后，各地即相继开始慰问活动，一般各省、市就地慰问者，约二十天左右结束；但去边防、海防地区慰问者，因路途遥远，交通不便，部队驻地分散，且慰问较为深入细致，故又延长一个月到两个多月不等，新疆、云南两地至五月间才结束了慰问工作。慰问团在陆、海、空军、工程建设部队、部队医院、革命残废军人教养院、革命残废军人学校和部队农场、牧场等单位举行了慰问大会、座谈会、英雄模范报告会，进行了个别访问，并到烈士陵园致敬、献花圈等；有的还访问了军队集体转业到工矿企业部门工作的干部，访问了地方党政机关和转业干部，举行了烈属、军属座谈会。这次慰问，除西藏全境和少数分散过远的驻军，因交通困难未去慰问，以及有少数分散执勤或外出的人员未受到慰问外，所有的部队一般均受到了慰问或看到了慰问演出。
    人民解放军自解放全国大陆之后，除积极肃清残匪外，坚决巩固海防、边防，严守战斗岗位，提防帝国主义的侵略；又进行了大规模的军事、政治、文化训练，大大提高了部队的素质；并坚决执行工作队的任务，参加了祖国的建设，密切了军民关系。所以全国人民热烈拥护慰问人民解放军的活动，对慰问团给予很大支持。慰问团到达边疆、海防地区时，都受到当地各族、各界人民的大规模的、隆重的欢迎。祖国人民的高度的爱国主义热情，给了我们以无限鼓励，督促我们决心很好地完成全国人民给予的光荣的慰问任务。
    部队对于迎接慰问团的问题，都根据军委总政治部的指示进行了思想教育，强调把此次慰问看作是人民和政府对军队的无微不至的关怀，是加强人民、政府和军队的亲密团结的重要措施，也是对军队普遍进行一次社会主义和爱国主义的生动教育。所以，组织慰问团的消息使部队非常兴奋。在帕米尔高原上放哨的战士，天天拿望远镜向北望，看看慰问团来了没有，有的战士梦中大喊起来：“亲人来了！”部队对于迎接慰问团作了充分准备，组织了专门招待人员，解决了交通、食宿等问题。各军队驻地的党政机关和群众团体，也给了我们许多具体的帮助。
    慰问时，一般采用了普遍慰问、重点深入（开慰问大会与深入各单位访问相结合）的方式，同时，有一些代表向部队报告了总路线和工农业建设情况、劳动模范事迹，志愿军代表向部队作了抗美援朝战争胜利的报告。总团去海防、边防地区慰问的黄松龄（去山东沿海），陈叔通、谢有法（去浙江舟山群岛一带），茅盾、何长工（去福建沿海），滕代远、蒋光鼐、谭余保、梅兰芳、胡克实（去广州及海南岛一带），史良、栗再温（去四川及康藏公路），王从吾、蔡树藩（去云南边疆），许广平、袁任远、杨明轩（去新疆各地），梁希、张启龙（去东北）等各位副总团长，都是不辞辛苦、长途跋涉，并亲到部队和战士见面。代表和文艺工作团团员到连队和医院、革命残废军人学校慰问时，争着为战士洗、补衣服，帮助炊事员作饭；有的还到哨所、马棚、牧场等处慰问哨兵和工作人员。代表中许多老年和妇女同志也一样爬山涉水去海岛或边防慰问部队。此次慰问中，一般剧团及电影放映队均表现热情艰苦，发挥了高度的忘我劳动精神，尽量满足部队的要求，力求丰富演出的节目；他们还帮助部队文艺工作团提高艺术修养，也向部队学了许多东西。在演出以前，剧团就在会场上打锣打鼓欢迎部队入场；演完后，演员不卸装就跳下台来和部队同志握手、拥抱。许多演员一天连演数场，或每天走很远的路，还是坚持演出。有的女演员怀孕、生病都坚持演出。去康藏地区慰问的演员，因高原空气稀薄，就吸着特备的氧气表演，有的剧团就在风雪或雨中演出。梅兰芳副总团长及许多名演员都亲自到医院病房为伤病员、或到连队炊事班中为炊事员清唱。这些热烈场面多次感动得双方都流下热泪。
    这次的普遍慰问工作，给了部队以极大的鼓舞，提高了部队的战斗意志，增强了部队的荣誉感，增强了部队的团结和巩固。一般经过慰问之后，部队同志感到做一个人民战士非常光荣。部队一致表示：感谢祖国人民和毛主席的关怀，尤其边防、海防的部队更为兴奋和感激。新疆边防部队有的战士说：“儿行千里娘操心，祖国人民和毛主席像爹娘一样关怀我们。”驻新疆阿勒泰的战士编了这样的歌曲：“克浪河的流水清又清，阿勒泰紧紧连着北京。”华东某海防部队在和慰问团代表握别时，有一个同志非常激动，热泪盈眶，从地上捡起一块小石头对代表说：“请转告祖国人民和毛主席，我们坚决保卫祖国的海防。祖国的一切，就连这块小石头也不让敌人抢去。”山东海防某部一个战士，爬到机枪掩体上对代表说：“当祖国需要我的时候，我可以学习黄继光的精神，用自己的血肉来保卫祖国。”修筑康藏公路的部队向慰问团表示决心：一定要把公路修通到拉萨。有些战士把慰问团赠给他们的纪念章藏起来，说等立了功才佩带。这次各总分团接到了数万封战士表示决心和感谢的来信。这次慰问也加强了解放军和志愿军的互相鼓励和互相学习。志愿军的代表和文艺工作团分别慰问重要边防、海防部队和其他部队时，两方面的英雄模范会面，作了亲切交谈；解放军部队听了志愿军抗美援朝战争胜利的报告；志愿军也亲自看到了在边疆、海岛的部队的极端艰苦的情况，看到了国内部队文化学习和正规化的军事练兵成绩，看到了工程建设部队的热情劳动等等。这样大大增强了双方的亲密团结。山东海防部队某部管理股股长张国瑞同志献给志愿军代表一首诗：“志愿军，解放军，根是一条根，心是一条心；你在朝鲜打美国鬼，我在祖国看大门，祖国有了你和我，进行建设才放心。”这首诗足以表现解放军和志愿军的亲密团结和保卫祖国的决心。
    这次慰问提高了部队的社会主义思想和保卫祖国建设的意志，推动了部队当前的各项工作，增强了部队为建设现代化国防军而奋斗的决心与信心。慰问期间正是部队开始学习总路线的时候，华东总分团的代表向部队报告上海工业生产总值四年来已增加了三倍，战士们感到特别兴奋。广西省一位军属劳动模范田英荣向部队介绍自己的事迹说：“在旧社会我没有饭吃，去年我就能卖给国家一千六百斤粮食。那时许多军人向家属写信动员家庭卖粮，惟独我那爱人总不写信，我心里很气，我想他不动员我，我可要动员他，卖完粮时就写信给他，向他提出竞赛，希望他在前方立功。”这番话给战士们以很大激励和教育。许多人受到慰问后，又自动认购了国家经济建设公债。许多人将记着代表报告的笔记寄回家中，动员家庭卖粮和参加农业生产合作社。华东海军某警卫部队的一个同志听了代表报告后，向代表团献了一首诗：“就为着现代化的工厂林立，就为着拖拉机将要拥抱祖国的土地，我才毅然站在这里。那怕世界上只剩下一个敌人，我也不能轻易放下武器；如果祖国需要我付出生命，那我是毫无犹豫。”部队社会主义思想的提高，更具体表现在慰问活动推动了部队当前的工作。部队迎接慰问团的口号就是“提高学习成绩来迎接亲人”。某修建营房的部队的战士自动提出“迎接慰问团，多背两块砖”。在慰问活动期间，许多单位出现了工作效率提高，提前完成任务，伤病员要求提前出院，打靶成绩提高等模范事例。许多革命残废军人都向慰问团表示：我们虽然身体残废了，但是思想没有残废，一定要好好学习，将来好参加祖国的建设工作。
    这次慰问工作密切了军队和人民、政府的关系。慰问中，部队人员和许多劳动模范尤其烈军属代表的接触，听了党政干部的报告，进一步了解了国家政治经济建设情况，这就更加提高了部队的群众观念。在部队和人民代表的接触中发生了很多动人的场面：河南军区功臣蒋太贞同志听了河南分团代表王秀鸾老大娘（她三个儿子参加了革命军队，大儿子已牺牲，她本人还是一位劳动模范）的报告后，激动地说：“因为我没了父母，我两次立功的喜报没处寄，今天听了王老大娘的报告，越听越像我的母亲，我要将这两张立功喜报献给王妈妈，她就是我的母亲。”劳动模范李田英在华东军区为战士杨发禄佩带纪念章时说：“没有你们，那有俺们劳动模范！”杨发禄同志回答说：“没有人民，也没有人民解放军。”部队对慰问团代表都一律称为“亲人”，代表们住的房子，叫作“亲人宿舍”，部队扎的松门上写着“迎接亲人门”。代表们到部队后，遇到难以形容的热情欢迎和无微不至的招待，使代表受到极大的感动，许多代表都说：“这不是我们来慰问部队，而是部队在慰问我们。整个慰问活动中充满了军民团结的热烈气氛。”
    这次去边疆地区进行大规模的慰问，对于边疆各族人民的鼓舞很大，也更加促进了边疆部队与各族人民的亲密团结。在慰问中，都吸收了当地少数民族的领袖人物参加慰问工作，并且也对当地少数民族专门进行了慰问。许多少数民族的群众反映：中央重视保卫边疆的人民解放军，就是重视和爱护我们边疆的人民。同时，我们也深刻体会到解放军由于正确地贯彻了党的民族政策和严格遵守群众纪律，因而取得了各族人民的衷心拥护。部队对于遵守少数民族的风俗习惯，非常严格，此次招待慰问团时，对回族人士的代表照顾很周到，饮食用具上都写了“清真”字样。云南边防部队去年帮群众打害虫二十万斤，打死豺狼虎豹熊猴等野兽三十一万七千多只。新疆部队去年把自己开垦出来部分已经播种的土地四十一万多亩，交给各族人民。解放军这种为各族人民服务的精神，深深感动了各少数民族人民。苗族人民编的歌子说：“地动我们不动，山摇我们不摇，永远跟着共产党，永远拥护解放军。”这个歌子表现了少数民族对解放军的热爱。
    在慰问工作中同样地也给慰问团的代表以极深刻、生动的教育。在慰问中使我们深刻认识和体会了解放军艰苦奋斗、英勇牺牲、亲密团结、遵守纪律、克服困难、坚韧不拔的优良传统和高贵的品质。我们去海防、边防慰问时看到有些海防部队在荒无人烟的岛上，日夜巡逻，监视敌人，并要和大风浪搏斗，要随时提防毒蛇野兽。在某些边疆国防线上，部队分散执行警戒任务，省的报纸到达连队就要一个月；有的地方终年积雪吃不到青菜，有的地方要与蚊虫、疟疾、瘴气、潮湿等自然困难作斗争。修建康藏公路的部队，三年多来都住在帐棚里；在大雪封山粮食困难的时候，战士编的歌子是“有米吃干饭，米少吃稀饭，吃饭不吃饭，工作照样干。”这种革命乐观主义的精神感动得代表一致认为：解放军同志真不愧为最可爱的人。部队学习进步之快使许多教育界代表深为佩服。如许多工农出身的同志，经过部队的培养，现在可以掌握复杂的现代化的军事技术，可以驾驶飞机、坦克；很多战士入伍时是文盲或半文盲，一年的学习后，达到了初小毕业以上程度。在慰问中，部队干部和英雄模范还向我们介绍了他们的革命英雄主义事迹，如进军边疆剿灭残匪，严守国防，痛击侵入我国海洋和天空的敌人；在悬岩峭壁上和雪山草地里开辟和修建公路；在戈壁滩上兴建了许多巨大的水利工程，开垦出千万亩良田，建立了许多机耕农场和现代化的工厂，出现了许多新的工农业城镇。许多部队打虎豹为人民除害，帮助人民劳动，治病救灾，海军保护渔民捕鱼。许多部队还参加了国家的工矿、铁路、林业、水利、建筑工程的建设等等。人民解放军这种艰苦奋斗的功绩，深深地教育和感动了慰问团的人员。有的部队还为代表团作了飞机、坦克的表演，代表们有的参观了实弹的战斗的演习，有的参观了部队各种军事展览，这都大大提高了代表们对建设强大的现代化的国防军的信心。
    总之，此次慰问工作基本上完成了全国人民给予我们的任务，对部队、对代表都有极大的教育意义。这次慰问工作所以能胜利地完成任务，主要是由于中国共产党中央和政协全国委员会、抗美援朝总会的正确领导，也由于中共各级党委、各级人民政府、各群众团体，特别是部队各级领导机关的大力支援和具体帮助；慰问团的全体代表和全体剧团人员的努力，也是完成慰问任务的重要保证。工作中最主要的问题：是由于组织慰问团的时间仓促，故准备不够充分；再因限于时间及交通条件，有些边远地区的国防部队和生产部队（如畜牧、伐木等部队）未能全部慰问到。还由于慰问日程一般排得太紧，多采取慰问大会的形式，而深入连队与战士见面谈心的机会太少。也由于时间紧促，所以往往部队准备了些英雄模范的报告，慰问团代表没有时间听，部队准备的展览会没有时间仔细看。
    慰问工作结束后，我们已通知各总分团，以小型座谈和报告会的形式，由各代表在其所在的地区、工厂和机关中进行此次慰问工作的宣传报告，着重宣传人民解放军艰苦奋斗的事迹，另外可通过报纸与广播进行宣传。各总分团因结束时间先后不一，一般均已进行了这样的宣传工作。
    各总分团在总结工作中均一致感到，这种慰问活动对于加强军民、军政的团结，作用甚大，对部队也很有鼓励作用，希望今后在一定时期仍可进行慰问。另外，从此次慰问中感到人民解放军艰苦卓绝的忘我斗争、集体英雄主义精神与全心全意为人民服务的高贵品质，还应在人民中多加以宣传，这对提高人民的生产劳动热情和爱国主义思想是很有作用的。
