The Northeast Petroleum Factory No. 5 restoration project is nearing completion, and production preparations are actively underway. Once the project is restored and put into production this year, the factory will become one of China's major natural petroleum refining facilities. Its production capacity will be more than four times greater than the factory's existing capacity.

Northeast Petroleum Factory No. 5 was originally a relatively large factory that was not fully completed. Before liberation, it was sabotaged by the enemy, and some equipment was stolen. Restoration began in 1952. The cracking workshop went into production last September, processing heavy oil and wax oil from Northeast Petroleum Factory No. 1 into automotive gasoline and fuel oil. After the atmospheric and vacuum distillation workshop, which began restoration this year, is put into production, it will refine large quantities of natural petroleum, fully supplying the factory's cracking workshop with feedstock oil. It will also produce more automotive gasoline, diesel, kerosene, fuel oil, and other products to meet the needs of China's transportation industry and rural lighting.

Currently, the factory's Party Committee, administration, trade union, Communist Youth League, and relevant departments have formed a trial run acceptance committee and have begun preparations for transferring to production. The various tools, labor protection equipment, fire prevention equipment, and various materials necessary for formal production have been purchased successively from Shenyang, Dalian, and other places. Various production management systems, such as the production responsibility system, shift handover system, meeting system, and regular inspection and maintenance system for mechanical equipment, have either been formulated or are being drafted. The technical workers and cadres who were transferred from nearby petroleum factories at the beginning of this year and concentrated at Northeast Petroleum Factory No. 7 for internships and training have now returned to the factory to familiarize themselves with the business and check the operation during the trial run, in preparation for the new production tasks.

    东北石油五厂恢复工程接近完成
    东北石油五厂恢复工程接近完成，生产准备工作正在积极进行。这个厂今年恢复的工程投入生产后，将成为我国制炼天然石油的主要工厂之一。它的生产能力要比这个厂现有的生产能力提高四倍以上。
    东北石油五厂原是一个规模比较大而没有完全建成的工厂。解放以前，曾遭到敌人的破坏，一部分设备被盗走。一九五二年开始恢复。去年九月裂化车间投入生产，把东北石油一厂出产的重油、蜡油加工成为车用汽油和燃料油。今年开始恢复的常减压蒸馏车间投入生产后，将制炼大量天然石油，充分供给这个厂裂化车间以原料油，并将生产更多的车用汽油、柴油、煤油、燃料油等，供应我国交通运输业和农村照明的需要。
    现在，这个厂的党委、行政、工会、青年团和有关科室组成的试车验收委员会，已开始进行移交生产的准备工作。正式生产所必需的各种工具、劳动保护用品、防火设备和各种材料，已陆续向沈阳、旅大等地购置。生产管理上的各种制度如生产专责制、交接班制、会议制、机械设备定期检修制等，有的已经制订好；有的正在着手拟订。今年年初从旁的石油厂抽调来并集中到东北石油七厂实习和训练的技术工人和干部，现在已回到厂里，准备在试车期间熟悉业务和检查运转情况，迎接新的生产任务。        （新华社）
