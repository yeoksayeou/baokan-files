Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, July 21st—Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference on the Problem of Restoring Peace in Indochina, attended by representatives from Cambodia, the State of Vietnam, the United States of America, the French Republic, Laos, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the People's Republic of China, the United Kingdom, and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on July 21, 1954.

I. The Conference takes note of the Agreements ending hostilities in Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam and organizing international supervision and control of the execution of the provisions thereof.

II. The Conference expresses satisfaction at the ending of hostilities in Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam. The Conference expresses its conviction that the execution of the provisions set out in the present declaration and in the Agreements on the cessation of hostilities will permit Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam henceforth to play their part, in full independence and sovereignty, in the peaceful community of nations.

 III．The Conference takes note of the declarations made by the Governments of Cambodia and Laos of their intention to adopt measure permitting all citizens to take their place in the national community, in particular in view of the forthcoming general elections, which, in conformity with the constitutions of these countries, shall take place in the course of the year 1955, by secret ballot and on conditions guaranteeing fundamental freedoms.

IV. The Conference takes note of the clauses in Agreements on the cessation of hostilities in Vietnam prohibiting the introduction into Vietnam of foreign troops and military personnel as well as of all kinds of arms and munitions. The Conference also takes note of the declarations made by the Governments of Laos and Cambodia, according to which they will not request the assistance of war materials, personnel or instructors except for the purpose of the effective defense of their territory, and, in the case of Laos, to the extent defined by the Agreements on the cessation of hostitlities in Laos.

V. The Conference takes note of the clauses in the Agreement on the cessation of hostilities in Vietnam to the effect that no military base under the control of a foreign State may be established in the regrouping zones of the two parties, the latter having the obligation to see that the zones allotted to them shall not constitute part of any military alliance and shall not be utilized for the resumption of hostilities or in the service of an aggressive policy.

The Conference also takes note of the declarations made by the Governments of Cambodia and Laos, according to which they will not join in any agreement with other States if this agreement includes the obligation to participate in a military alliance not in conformity with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, or, in the case of Laos, with the principles of the Agreement on the cessation of hostilities in Laos or, so long as their security is not threatened, the obligation to establish bases on Cambodian or Laotian territory for foreign military forces.

VI．The Conference recognizes that the essential purpose of the Agreement relating to Vietnam is to settle military questions with a view to ending hostilities and that the military demarcation line is provisional and should not in any way be interpreted as constituting a political or territorial boundary. The Conference expresses its conviction that the execution of the provisions set out in the present declaration and in the Agreement on the cessation of hostilities creates the necessary basis for the achievement in the near future of a political settlement in Vietnam.

VII．The Conference declares that, so far as Vietnam is concerned, the settlement of political problems, effected on the basis of respect for the principles of independence, unity and territorial integrity, shall permit the Vietnamese people to enjoy the fundamental freedoms, guaranteed by democratic institutions established as a result of free general elections by secret ballot.

In order to ensure that sufficient progress in the restoration of peace has been made, and that all the necessary conditions obtain for free expression of the national will, general elections shall be held in July 1956, under the supervision of an international commission composed of representatives of the Member States of the International Supervisory Commission, referred to in the Agreement on the cessation of hostilities. Consultations will be held on this subject between the competent representative authorities of the two zones from 20 July 1955 onwards.

VIII．The provisions of the Agreements on the cessation of hostilities, dealing with the protection of individuals and of property must be most strictly applied and must, in particular, allow everyone in Vietnam to decide freely in which zone he wishes to live.

IX．The competent representative authorities of the Northern and Southern zones of Vietnam, as well as the authorities of Laos and Cambodia, must not permit any individual or collective acts of reprisal against persons who have collaborated in any way with one of the parties during the war, or against members of such persons' families.

X．The Conference takes note of the declaration of the Government of the French Republic to the effect that it is ready to withdraw its troops from the territory of Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam, at the request of the Governments concerned and within a period which shall be fixed by agreement between the Parties except in cases where, be agreement between the two Parties, a certain number of French troops shall remain at specified points and for a specified time.

XI．The Conference takes note of the declaration of the French Government that for the settlement of all the problems connected with the re-establishment and consolidation of peace in Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam, the French Government will proceed from the principle of respect for the independence, sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam.

XII．In their relations with Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam, each member of the Geneva Conference undertakes to respect the sovereignty, the independence, the unity and the territorial integrity of the above-mentioned states, and to refrain from any interference in their internal affairs.

XIII．The Members of the Conference agree to consult one an other in respect of any matter relating to Cambodia, Laos or Vietnam which might be referred to them by the International Supervisory Commission, in order to study such measures as may prove necessary to ensure that the Agreements on the cessation of hostilities in Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam are respected.
