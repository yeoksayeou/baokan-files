Xinhua News Agency, July 28th: TASS, New York, July 28th: According to sources in London, well-informed officials indicated that Churchill and Eden are uneasy about the incident near Hainan Island (the U.S. aircraft's attack on aircraft of the People’s Republic of China) because they believe this event “not only threatens the foundations of their foreign policy, but also threatens world peace.”

Xinhua News Agency, July 28th: TASS, London, July 28th: British newspapers, commenting on the news of U.S. aircraft shooting down two Chinese planes, expressed unease, fearing that the U.S.'s "rash" actions might lead to new and more serious incidents.

The "Manchester Guardian" said that the appearance of American fighter planes off the Chinese coast only three days after the British aircraft incident could be seen as a provocation.

The "Daily Mail's" diplomatic correspondent pointed out: "When the British passenger plane was shot down, we did not specifically request military action from the United States. As far as I know, the United States did not consult with the British government before sending two aircraft carriers (to the vicinity of Hainan Island)."

The "Times's" correspondent in Washington pointed out that the aircraft that Dulles spoke of as providing "rescue" were actually Skyraider aircraft launched from the Essex-class aircraft carrier. The correspondent noted that this type of aircraft is a "propeller-driven attack aircraft" that can be used for dive bombing, night raids, and anti-submarine patrols.

The "News Chronicle's" editorial said: "China's apology for shooting down the British civilian aircraft and their expression of willingness to consider compensation are timely and appropriate, and these expressions should be accepted. It is unsettling to hear that the U.S. forces in the Pacific have received orders to 'take action at any time,' which could cause trouble."

The "Daily Telegraph and Morning Post" said, "In view of the Chinese government's attitude, it is unfortunate that the U.S. sending aircraft carriers (to the vicinity of Hainan Island) has resulted in another shooting."

    邱吉尔和艾登对美机挑衅事件表示不安
    英国报纸担心美国可能引起新的更严重的事件
    【新华社二十八日讯】塔斯社纽约二十八日讯：据伦敦消息说，消息灵通官员指出，邱吉尔和艾登对在海南岛附近发生的事件（美国飞机对中华人民共和国飞机的攻击）感到不安，因为他们认为这个事件“不但威胁了他们外交政策的基础，而且也威胁了世界和平”。
    【新华社二十八日讯】据塔斯社伦敦二十八日讯：英国报纸在评论美国飞机击落两架中国飞机的消息时表示不安，担心美国的“轻率”的行动可能引起新的更严重的事件。
    “曼彻斯特卫报”说，在英国飞机出事三天后美国战斗机还出现在中国海岸，这看来可能像是一种挑衅。
    “每日邮报”外交记者指出：“当英国客机被击落时，我们并没有特别要求美国采取军事行动。据我所知，美国没有和英国政府商量，就派了两艘航空母舰（到海南岛附近去）。”
    “泰晤士报”驻华盛顿记者指出，杜勒斯所谈到的“援救”飞机实际上是从埃赛克斯级的航空母舰上起飞的空中袭击者式飞机。记者指出，这种飞机是“螺旋桨推进式的攻击机”，可以用来进行俯冲轰炸、夜袭、反潜水艇巡逻等。
    “新闻纪事报”社论说：“中国对击落英国民用飞机的道歉和他们要考虑赔偿的表示是及时的、适当的，应该接受这些表示。令人不安的是，听说美国驻太平洋的部队得到了‘随时采取行动’的命令，这种命令是会引起麻烦的”。
    “每日电讯与晨邮报”说，“照中国政府的态度看来，美国派航空母舰（到海南岛附近去）的行动造成了以后另一次的射击，这是不幸的。”
