    Yantai, Qingdao, and Other Aquatic Product Companies
    Harvest Large Quantities of Mackerel
    Beginning in late May, the mackerel production season started in the Yantai area. On the vast sea, hundreds of new-style purse seine fishing vessels from aquatic product companies in Yantai, Qingdao, Dalian, Liaodong, and Tianjin, along with nearly a thousand local fishermen's sailing boats, are engaged in intense fishing operations every day. Due to frequent winds at sea and erratic changes in seawater temperature and salinity this year, the fishing work has encountered considerable difficulties. The fishermen of the aquatic product companies and the coastal fishermen have responded to this situation by putting forward the slogan: "Go to the deep sea, overcome difficulties, and persist in production!" As a result, hand-operated net fishing vessels, which used to ignite their fires and cast their nets at 3:00 AM, are now casting seven nets per day on average, compared to the previous six. The Shandong No. 14 vessel persisted in production despite breaking its hawser five times in one day. Many ships loaded with fish returned to port at night to unload their catch and then returned to the fishing grounds to cast their nets again overnight. The entire crew of the Shandong No. 2 and No. 4 paired vessels worked hard to catch 5,700 boxes of fish in one day, setting a national record for the highest daily output of hand-operated nets on a single voyage. The fishermen of the Qingdao No. 3 vessel, in order to catch more mackerel, scouted the movement patterns of the mackerel in advance and increased the height of the net opening and the size of the net cover, thus breaking Qingdao's historical record for the highest daily output with 1,070 boxes. The fishermen of the Qingdao Model Fishing Vessel No. 49 improved their operating methods and created a four-boat mutual aid operation method, making full use of the time between net retrievals to increase the number of net casts. In two days, they exceeded their quota by catching 6,000 boxes of fish. The paired purse seine fishing vessels No. 50 and No. 52 caught 190,000 catties of fish in one day, breaking the peak season daily output record of 170,000 catties for all paired vessels in the port last year. The six sailing boats with drift nets of the Jianhua Fishery Production Cooperative in Dongkou Village also caught more than 96,000 catties of mackerel.
    According to tests conducted by the Institute of Marine Biology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Central Aquatic Products Experimental Institute, as of mid-June, many mackerel had not yet spawned. Therefore, it is estimated that the mackerel production season will be prolonged this year, and the output will increase accordingly. Currently, the fishing vessels and sailing boats entering the Yantai fishing grounds are still engaged in intense fishing operations. (Gao Liang)

    烟台青岛等水产公司
    捕获大量鲭鱼
    从五月下旬起，烟台地区开始了鲭鱼的生产季节。在广阔的海面上，每天都有烟台、青岛、旅大、辽东和天津等地水产公司的上百艘新式围网渔轮和近千只当地渔民的帆船，进行紧张的捕捞工作。由于今年海上多风、海水的温度与盐度变化无常，给捕捞工作增加了不少困难。水产公司的渔工和沿海渔民们，针对这种情况，提出：到远洋去，克服困难，坚持生产的口号。因而手操网渔轮在黑夜三点钟就生火下网，每日平均拉六网的现在拉到了七网。山东十四号轮一天断绠五次仍坚持生产。许多打满了鱼的船，夜里返港卸鱼后又连夜返回渔场下网。山东二、四号对轮全体渔工努力捕捞，一天就捕获了五千七百箱鱼，创造了全国手操网一次航海日产的最高纪录。青岛三号轮的渔工为更多的拉到道鱼，预先侦察好鲭鱼游动的规律，把网口加高，网盖加大，因此以一天一千零七十箱的成绩打破青岛历年来的最高日产量。青岛模范渔轮四十九号轮的渔工改善操作方法，创造了四船互助作业法，充分利用了收网空隙时间增加了网次，两天时间内，他们就超额捕捞了六千箱鱼。围网渔轮五○和五二号对轮一天捕鱼十九万斤，突破去年旺季全港对轮日产量最高十七万斤的纪录。东口村建华渔业生产合作社的六条帆船放流网，也捕获了九万六千多斤鲭鱼。
    根据中国科学院海洋生物研究室和中央水产实验所的化验，至六月中旬许多鲭鱼尚未产卵，因此估计今年大海市生产时间将拖长，由此产量将会增加，现开入烟台渔场的渔轮和帆船仍在紧张捕捞中。　（高粮）
