    Jiangsu Province Dongxin Farm Achieves Wheat Harvest
    The state-owned Dongxin Farm in Xinpu County, Jiangsu Province, has achieved a bumper wheat harvest. This year, the farm had more than 14,700 mu of wheat, which has now been completely harvested. The average yield per mu is more than 130 jin, an increase of 44 percent compared to last year. The farm's wheat fields were originally saline-alkali wasteland with weeds and insect pests. Thanks to the use of mechanized farming, the implementation of advanced scientific techniques such as deep plowing, close planting, and soil improvement, various natural disasters were overcome, resulting in increased production. Currently, the farm's staff are working hard on summer plowing and land reclamation, striving to produce more grain next year.

    江苏省东辛农场小麦丰收
    江苏省新浦县国营东辛农场的小麦获得丰收。该场今年有一万四千七百多亩小麦，现已收割完毕，平均每亩产量一百三十多斤，比去年增产百分之四十四，该场麦田原是盐碱荒草滩，杂草、虫害很多，由于采用机械耕作，实行了深耕、密植、土壤改良等先进科学技术，战胜了各种自然灾害，获得了增产。目前，该场职工正紧张地进行伏耕，开荒工作，为明年增产更多的粮食而努力。
