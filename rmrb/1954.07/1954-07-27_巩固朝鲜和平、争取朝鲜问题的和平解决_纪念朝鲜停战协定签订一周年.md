Consolidate Korean Peace and Strive for a Peaceful Resolution of the Korean Issue
—Commemorating the First Anniversary of the Korean Armistice Agreement
Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea

    Today is the first anniversary of the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement. With excitement, we join the peace-loving people of the world in commemorating this day, which marks a historic victory for the forces of peace.
    The signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement is the most important milestone in the struggle of all peace forces against the forces of aggression and for the relaxation of international tensions. It demonstrated the military, political, and moral failure of the United States in the Korean War. It demonstrated the invincibility of the heroic Korean people and the valiant Chinese People's Volunteers who fought for justice and peace. It demonstrated that peaceful negotiation is the only way to resolve all international issues. The development of the international situation over the past year has indisputably confirmed its enormous contribution to peace in Asia and the world. The Berlin Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference held shortly after the Korean armistice and the Geneva Conference convened under the agreement of that conference are of great significance for resolving international issues through peaceful negotiation, thereby promoting a further easing of the international situation.
    Since the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement a year ago, the people of China and Korea have consistently and faithfully implemented and maintained the armistice agreement, and have made continuous and significant efforts to consolidate peace in Korea and to peacefully resolve the Korean issue. The agreement reached at the Berlin Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference to convene the Geneva Conference to discuss the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and the restoration of peace in Indochina has received the active support of the people of China and Korea. The delegations of Korea, China, and the Soviet Union, attending the Geneva Conference, made active and significant efforts in the negotiations on the Korean issue.
    After the Korean armistice was realized, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, having repelled the American aggressors, with the fraternal assistance of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, successfully completed the preparatory work for restoring and developing the people's economy, began implementing a large-scale three-year construction plan, and achieved great success. The Chinese people are accelerating the socialist construction of the country with high labor enthusiasm, and are continuing to deepen the movement to resist America and aid Korea in order to support the Korean people in restoring their postwar economic construction and striving for the peaceful reunification of their motherland. There is no doubt that the active peaceful construction of their countries by the people of China and Korea will continuously strengthen the powerful forces for maintaining peace in Korea and peace in the Far East.
    However, the facts of the year since the Korean armistice have also shown the completely different attitude adopted by the United States. Although the American ruling clique suffered a serious defeat in the Korean War and was forced to sign the Korean Armistice Agreement, it still has not learned the lesson it should have from the Korean War. Immediately after the Korean War ended, the United States signed the so-called mutual defense treaty with the Syngman Rhee group, stipulating that the United States would station troops in South Korea indefinitely. Syngman Rhee, under the aegis of the United States, also actively expanded his army and kept clamoring for a military "northward advance." The United States and the Syngman Rhee group have also continuously violated the armistice agreement and interrupted the bilateral talks for convening the Korean political conference stipulated in the armistice agreement. At the Geneva Conference, the United States unreasonably rejected all the fair and feasible proposals of the Korean, Chinese, and Soviet delegations for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. Even on June 15, at the fifteenth meeting discussing the Korean issue, it refused to reach a minimum agreement with the Korean, Chinese, and Soviet sides regarding relevant countries continuing to negotiate and seek a peaceful resolution in the future. It coerced its followers into sabotaging the Geneva Conference negotiations on the Korean issue, making it impossible to reach any agreement on this issue.
    The United States has continuously intensified its efforts to piece together military aggressive blocs in Asia, and is actively engaged in new military adventures, seriously threatening the peace and security of the people of China and Korea, as well as the people of Asian countries.
    All this shows that the American ruling clique, regardless of the fact that the situation in Asia has undergone fundamental changes, still attempts to continue to maintain the already decadent imperialist colonial system in Asia, to turn the entire Korea into a slave of its colonial policy, and to use it as a springboard for aggression against China.
    The colonial policy consistently adopted by the American ruling clique simultaneously thoroughly exposes its refusal to peacefully resolve the Korean issue and other international issues through negotiation, and its obstinate opposition to the easing of international tensions.
    However, despite that, the Korean issue has not and cannot be erased from the international negotiation agenda. The various proposals for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue put forward by the Korean, Chinese, and Soviet delegations at the Geneva Conference have penetrated deeply into the hearts of the people and have received unanimous support from the people of the world. Just public opinion throughout the world is unanimously calling for the resumption of negotiations on the Korean issue. The peace-loving people throughout the world demand the consolidation of peace in Korea and the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue through negotiation. This strong desire for peace is invincible.
    The Korean Armistice Agreement is a fruit won by the people of China and Korea and all peace forces in the world through great effort, and must absolutely not be allowed to be sabotaged. After the United States sabotaged the Geneva Conference negotiations on the Korean issue, the task we face is to continue to maintain the implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement, strictly prevent the recurrence of the Korean War, and strive to resume negotiations on the Korean issue as soon as possible. Korea must transition from an unstable state of armistice to lasting peace, and the Korean people's national aspiration for peaceful reunification on a democratic basis must be realized. This not only conforms to the vital interests of the entire Korean people, but is also a necessary step in consolidating peace in Asia and the world.
    The people of China and Korea jointly waged arduous battles to defend the security of their homelands and peace in the Far East, and won the great victory of the Korean armistice. We must consolidate this victory and continue to work to prevent the recurrence of war and the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. The unbreakable friendship and unity between the people of China and Korea, cemented with blood, is a guarantee for consolidating peace in Korea. We must constantly develop this lofty friendship of internationalism that has been tested by the severe flames of war. In the year since the Korean armistice, the people of China and Korea have demonstrated a spirit of close and inseparable brotherly unity in enhancing economic and cultural mutual assistance and cooperation, and in the common cause of maintaining the Korean armistice and striving for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. This shows the continuous enhancement and consolidation of the friendship between our two peoples.
    This friendship and unity between the people of China and Korea is also a manifestation of the strong unity of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, and it is a manifestation of the unity of our peace and democracy camp in the struggle for lasting peace.
    Today, as we commemorate the first anniversary of the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement, all of us in China must continue to deepen the movement to resist America and aid Korea, accelerate and actively engage in the socialist construction of our country, and use practical actions to assist the Korean people and support the Chinese People's Volunteers in continuing to work together with the Korean people and the Korean People's Army to maintain the implementation of the armistice agreement, and unyieldingly strive for the early realization of the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. In order to achieve the final victory, let us, together with the Korean people and the peace-loving people of the world, continue to advance, holding high the righteous banner of opposing aggression and defending peace.

### 巩固朝鲜和平、争取朝鲜问题的和平解决——纪念朝鲜停战协定签订一周年

    巩固朝鲜和平、争取朝鲜问题的和平解决
    ——纪念朝鲜停战协定签订一周年
    中国人民抗美援朝总会主席  郭沫若
    今天是朝鲜停战协定签订一周年纪念日，我们怀抱着兴奋的心情，与全世界爱好和平的人民一道，来纪念这个标志着和平力量的历史性胜利的日子。
    朝鲜停战协定的签订是一切和平力量反对侵略势力、争取缓和国际紧张局势斗争中最重要的里程碑。它说明了美国在侵朝战争中的军事、政治和道义的失败。它说明了为正义与和平而战的英雄的朝鲜人民和英勇的中国人民志愿军的不可战胜。它说明了和平协商乃是解决一切国际问题的唯一途径。一年来国际形势的发展，无可置辩地证实了它对亚洲和世界和平的巨大贡献。在朝鲜停战后不久举行的柏林四国外长会议和根据这一会议的协议而召开的日内瓦会议，对于通过和平协商以解决国际问题，从而促使国际局势进一步趋向缓和具有重大的意义。
    朝鲜停战协定签订一年以来，中朝两国人民一贯忠实地履行并维护停战协定，并且坚定不移地为巩固朝鲜和平及朝鲜问题的和平解决，进行了不断的、重大的努力。柏林四国外长会议关于召开日内瓦会议来讨论和平解决朝鲜问题和恢复印度支那和平的协议，获得中朝两国人民积极的支持。出席日内瓦会议的朝、中、苏三国代表团对朝鲜问题的谈判作了积极而重大的努力。
    朝鲜停战实现以后，击退了美国侵略者的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国在以苏联为首的和平民主阵营的兄弟般的援助之下，胜利地完成了恢复和发展人民经济的准备工作，开始实施了大规模的三年建设计划，并获得了很大的成就。中国人民正以高度的劳动热情，加速进行着国家的社会主义建设事业，并为支援朝鲜人民恢复战后经济建设和争取祖国的和平统一而继续深入开展抗美援朝运动。毫无疑义，中朝两国人民积极进行着国家的和平建设，都将使维护朝鲜和平及远东和平的强大力量不断地增强。
    但朝鲜停战一年来的事实，同时也表明了美国所采取的另一种截然不同的态度。美国统治集团虽然在侵朝战争中遭到了严重的失败而不能不被迫签订朝鲜停战协定，却仍然没有从侵朝战争中吸取应得的教训。朝鲜战争刚刚停止，美国就同李承晚集团签订了所谓共同防御条约，规定美国将无限期地驻兵南朝鲜。李承晚也在美国卵翼之下积极扩充他的军队，一直叫嚣着武力“北进”。美国和李承晚集团并不断地违反停战协定，中断了为召开停战协定规定的朝鲜政治会议的双方会谈。在日内瓦会议上，美国又无理地拒绝了朝、中、苏代表团关于和平解决朝鲜问题的一切公正可行的建议，甚至在六月十五日，在讨论朝鲜问题的第十五次会议上拒绝了与朝、中、苏方面达成关于有关国家在将来仍将协商寻求和平解决的最低限度的协议，胁迫着它的追随者一同破坏了日内瓦会议关于朝鲜问题的谈判，使这一问题未能达成任何协议。
    美国接连加紧在亚洲拼凑军事性的侵略集团，积极从事新的军事冒险行动，严重威胁着中朝两国人民以及亚洲各国人民的和平安全。
    这些，都表明了美国统治集团不顾亚洲形势业已发生根本转变的事实，而仍然企图继续在亚洲维持业已腐朽了的帝国主义殖民制度，企图变全朝鲜为其殖民政策的奴役对象，和作为侵略中国的跳板。
    美国统治集团所一贯采取的这种殖民政策，同时彻底暴露了它拒绝以协商方式和平解决朝鲜问题及其他国际问题，顽梗不化地反对国际紧张局势的缓和。
    然而，尽管那样，朝鲜问题却没有也不能从国际协商日程上抹掉。朝、中、苏三国代表团在日内瓦会议上提出的关于和平解决朝鲜问题的各项建议，已经深入人心，受到世界人民一致的支持。全世界的公正舆论都一致呼吁着朝鲜问题的谈判重新恢复。全世界爱好和平的人民是要求巩固朝鲜和平和经由协商来和平解决朝鲜问题的。这个强烈的和平意愿是不可战胜的。
    朝鲜停战协定是中朝两国人民以及世界一切和平力量经过重大努力赢取得来的果实，绝对不能容许破坏。在美国破坏了日内瓦会议关于朝鲜问题的谈判之后，我们面临的任务就是要继续维护朝鲜停战协定的实施，严防朝鲜战争的再起，和争取尽快地恢复朝鲜问题的谈判。朝鲜一定要由不稳定的停战状态转入持久的和平，朝鲜人民要求在民主基础上和平统一的民族愿望一定要得到实现。这不仅是符合于全体朝鲜人民的切身利益，而且也是在巩固亚洲及世界和平上所必需的步骤。
    中朝两国人民共同为保卫祖国的安全和远东的和平进行了艰巨的战斗，赢得了朝鲜停战的伟大胜利，我们必须巩固这一胜利，继续为防止战争的再起和朝鲜问题的和平解决而努力。中朝两国人民以鲜血凝成的牢不可破的友谊团结，是巩固朝鲜和平的保障，我们必须不断地发展这一经过严重战火考验的国际主义的崇高友谊。朝鲜停战的一年来，中朝两国人民在增强经济文化的互助合作，在维护朝鲜停战及争取朝鲜问题的和平解决的共同事业中，都表现了亲密无间的友爱团结的精神，这说明了我们两国人民的友谊的不断增强和巩固。
    中朝两国人民的这种友谊团结，同时是以苏联为首的和平民主阵营的坚强团结的表现，是我们和平民主阵营为持久和平而斗争的团结的表现。
    在今天我们纪念朝鲜停战协定签订一周年之际，我们全中国人民要继续深入抗美援朝运动，加紧推进并积极从事我国的社会主义建设事业，以实际的行动来援助朝鲜人民，支援中国人民志愿军继续和朝鲜人民及朝鲜人民军一道维护停战协定的实施，不屈不挠地争取朝鲜问题和平解决的及早实现。为了获得最后的胜利，让我们同朝鲜人民一道，同全世界爱好和平的人民一道，高举着反对侵略、保卫和平的正义旗帜继续前进。
