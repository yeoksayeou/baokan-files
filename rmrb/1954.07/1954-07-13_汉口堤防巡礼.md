　　A Tour of the Hankou Levee

　　Hankou is a city surrounded by the Yangtze River, the Han River, and the lakes connecting the Yangtze and Han Rivers. The city's levee line is as long as 59 kilometers. Since the beginning of summer this year, due to the high water levels of the rivers, coupled with the fact that the lakes connected to the Yangtze River are at the same level as the river water, the water surface, which is now higher than the city's ground level, has surrounded Hankou, and the city is protected by the levees surrounding it. People are engaged in a fierce battle with the flood.

　　At eight o'clock in the morning on the ninth, when the hands of the giant clock standing on the Wuhan Customs Building pointed to eight o'clock, the Wuhan Customs water level gauge told people that the Yangtze River's water level had reached 27.75 meters. This is the second highest water level in Wuhan since 1868 when hydrological records began nearly 90 years ago, and it has exceeded the water level on the same day in 1931, when Hankou suffered a major flood. However, the streets of the city are still the same as usual.

　　On this day, the reporter, along with the head and chief engineer of the Wuhan Flood Control Headquarters, inspected the levee projects surrounding the city of Hankou. Tens of thousands of flood control teams were standing guard on the levees. Piles of new soil were everywhere, and all the levees were being reinforced and raised urgently. As we passed the embankment along the river, high waterproof walls were being reinforced with new earthen levees. Sacks filled with soil were placed in rows on top of the embankment, making the levee body about five decimeters to one meter higher than before. When we reached the Danshuichi area, where a breach in the levee caused a disaster in Hankou in 1931, the head of the headquarters and the engineer stopped to carefully inspect these levee sections, especially the Fenjinlu levee section, and immediately took consolidation measures even if they found any slight danger. At the place where the Tokyo-Hankou Railway forks at "Danshuichi", railway workers and flood control team members were busy raising the tracks. In 1931, the Yangtze River flood first rushed into the city through here, causing a huge disaster. Now that this section of the railway has been raised and the levee has been reinforced, it can be guaranteed that traffic will not be hindered by the flood and that this gap will be blocked.

　　North of Wuhan City is the Zhanggong Levee, which extends for dozens of miles. Large trucks can travel back and forth on this levee, some fully loaded with soil and sacks for repairing the levee, and some carrying large quantities of steel pipes and heavy power generation transformers for the water pumps. On the lake surface outside the Zhanggong Levee, fleets of sailboats are continuously transporting large amounts of stones and soil to the construction site from dozens of miles away across the lake. The magnificent shouts of the flood control team members carrying soil and tamping the earth, together with the many broadcasting loudspeakers newly installed along the levee, are playing a symphony of enthusiastic labor. In order to ensure that the flood control project continues day and night, electric lights have now been erected throughout the levee.

　　The levee line in the Jinyin Lake area in the northern suburbs of Hankou has now become a modern drainage base. More than 100 water pumps transported from all over the country have been installed here. Many new sheds and small power stations have also been built along the levee. The generators or diesel engines of the water pumps roared, and countless steel pipes stretched their necks, gradually draining the waterlogged area inside the Zhanggong Levee into the lake outside the levee. The area west of Gunai Tree in the northern part of the city is relatively high, and there is less waterlogging, and with the efforts of the water pumps, the flooded area has gradually revealed a lush green pastoral landscape. The flood level outside the levee is higher than the fields inside the levee, but the thriving rice plants still stretch their green leaves and sway in the wind. After the water pumps drained the waterlogged rice fields, the farmers promptly transplanted late rice seedlings, striving for a good harvest in the autumn. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 汉口堤防巡礼

    汉口堤防巡礼
    汉口是长江、汉水以及和长江、汉水衔接的湖水环绕着的一个城市。市区的堤防线长达五十九公里。今年入夏以来由于江河水位高涨，加上和长江相通的湖水和江水相平，现在比市区地面更高的水面已包围了汉口，市区由环市的堤防保卫着。人们和洪水展开着激烈的战斗。
    九日早晨，矗立在武汉关大楼上的巨钟的时针指在八点的时候，武汉关的水位标尺告诉人们长江的水位已经到了二十七点七五公尺。这是武汉市自一八六八年起有水文纪录的近九十年来第二次的最高水位，并已超过了汉口发生大水灾的一九三一年同一天水位。但是，现在市区街道上还和平时一样。
    这一天，记者随着武汉市防汛指挥部的负责人和总工程师，一道巡视了环绕汉口市区的堤防工程。堤防上有成千上万的防汛队伍在坚守着。到处都是堆积如山的新泥土，全部的堤防都在紧张地培修和加高。当我们经过沿江大堤时，高高的防水墙都培修了新的土堤。装着泥土的麻包一排排地压在堤防的顶端，使堤身比原来高了五公寸到一公尺左右。走到一九三一年汉口溃口成灾的丹水池一带时，指挥部的负责人和工程师停下来，仔细地检查了这些堤段，特别是分金炉堤段，即便发现任何一点不大的险情，马上就采取了巩固措施。在“丹水池”以东京汉铁路岔堤的地方，铁路工人和防汛队员们正忙着把路轨垫高。一九三一年长江的洪水就是经这里首先冲入市区，造成了巨大的灾难。现在这段铁路垫高了，堤防加固了，就可以保证既不会因洪水妨害交通，又把这个缺口堵住了。
    武汉市区以北有延长数十里的张公堤。大卡车可以在这个堤上来往行驶，有的满载着修堤的泥土和麻袋，有的运来抽水机用的大批钢管和笨重的发电变压器。张公堤外的湖面上，成群结队的帆船行列，正从隔湖数十里外源源把大量石头和泥土送到工地上来。防汛队员们抬土、打夯的雄壮号子声，和沿堤新装置的许多广播喇叭，一同奏着热情劳动的交响曲。为了使防汛工程日夜不停地进行，现在全堤都架起了电灯。
    汉口北郊金银滩一带的堤防线上，现在已变成了一座现代化的排水基地。从全国各地远道运来的一百多部抽水机安装在这里。沿堤还新盖了许多工棚和小型的发电站。抽水机的发电机或柴油机轰叫着，数不清的钢管伸长了脖子，把张公堤内一片汪洋的积水逐渐排到堤外的湖里去。市区正北姑奶树以西一带地势较高，积水淹田较少，加以抽水机的努力，被淹的也逐渐露出一片葱绿的田园景色。堤外的洪水位已比堤内田地高过人头，但堤内茁壮的水稻照常伸展着碧绿的叶子，随风摇动，许多曾被积水淹过的稻田，抽水机把积水排出以后，农民们又及时插上了晚稻秧，争取秋季的丰收。（新华社）
