    Guarantee the Quality of Students in Workers and Peasants' Accelerated Secondary Schools

    The enrollment work for the National Workers and Peasants' Accelerated Secondary Schools in 1954 has entered the stage of registration and examination. Party committees and people's governments at all levels should strengthen their leadership over the enrollment work to effectively guarantee the quality of this year's new students, so as to cultivate qualified technical experts and management cadres from worker and peasant backgrounds to meet the urgent needs of socialist construction.

    In order to guarantee the quality of students in Workers and Peasants' Accelerated Secondary Schools, Party committees at all levels must urge relevant departments to do a good job in selecting and sending students. That is, they should select students conscientiously and responsibly in accordance with the application conditions stipulated by the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government, and conduct preliminary reviews of the political, health, and cultural conditions of the applicants. Special attention should be paid to political quality here. After the relevant departments have reviewed the applicants, they should responsibly provide materials to the school.

    Judging from the current situation of newly registered students, the work of selecting and sending students this year is generally done well. For example, among the industrial workers recommended by the Beijing Municipal Local Industry Bureau, labor models account for 10 percent, and those who have been commended for meritorious service account for about one-third. Special cadres are assigned to help workers with the application procedures. Many units provide various conveniences for applicants to review their lessons, so that they are more confident in taking the examination. However, some units have adopted a perfunctory attitude, refusing to select and send young workers and cadres who are of good quality, work actively, are healthy, have the potential for cultivation, and can be selected; some units send those who do not have long-term learning conditions or those who are not active in their work or even make mistakes to "make up the numbers," and change their age and class status for these people. In the appraisal, they only write about the advantages, not the disadvantages, or falsely report the situation, conceal the mistakes; individual factories and mines do not support the workers who meet the conditions and require to apply for the examination, deliberately saying that they are not progressive and active enough and need to continue to exercise in production labor. This kind of localism that disregards the state's plan for training workers and peasants' cadres and haggles over the interests of a factory or a mine must be corrected.

    Education administrative departments at all levels and all Workers and Peasants' Accelerated Secondary Schools should strictly adhere to the application conditions, conduct reviews and examinations based on facts, and never lower the quality of students or force to make up the numbers. Only those who have a clear history, meet the political conditions, are ideologically progressive, work actively, are healthy, are of appropriate age, have a cultural level equivalent to that of a senior primary school graduate, and have long-term training conditions can be admitted. Those who do not meet the conditions will not be accepted. When enrolling new students, first of all, attention should be paid to political conditions, that is, from a political point of view, consider whether the applicants have the conditions and potential to be cultivated into construction backbones. Secondly, from the perspective of long-term learning, attention should be paid to the health of the applicants. Only when the above basic conditions are met can the cultural level be used as the standard for admission. The practice of some schools that do not pay attention to political, health and other conditions, and use test scores as the only standard for admission should be corrected. On the issue of examinations, we should also carefully study and implement the examination syllabus for Workers and Peasants' Accelerated Secondary Schools issued by the Central Ministry of Education, set questions and grade them according to the requirements, prevent the phenomenon of excessively high or low requirements on cultural level, so as to effectively guarantee the quality of new students.

### 保证工农速成中学学生质量

    保证工农速成中学学生质量
    全国工农速成中学一九五四年的招生工作，已经进入报名和考试的阶段，各地党委和人民政府，应当加强对于招生工作的领导，切实保证今年新生的质量，以便培养合乎要求的工农出身的技术专家和管理干部，以满足社会主义建设事业的迫切需要。
    为了保证工农速成中学学生的质量，各地党委须督促有关部门做好选送学生的工作，即按照中央人民政府教育部所规定的报考条件，认真负责地选送学生，并对报考人员进行政治、健康、文化等条件的初步审查。这里应特别注意政治质量。有关部门对报考人员进行审查以后，应该负责地向学校提供材料。
    从现已报考的新生情况来看，今年选送学生的工作一般是做得比较好的。如北京市地方工业局保送的产业工人中，劳动模范占百分之十，立功受奖者约在三分之一以上，并专门指派干部帮助工人办理报考手续。不少单位对报考人员给予了复习功课的各种方便，使他们更有把握地参加考试。但是也有些单位采取了敷衍塞责的态度，不肯选送品质优良、工作积极、身体健康、有培养条件而又可能选送的青年工人和干部报考；有的单位把那些没有长期学习条件的人或工作不积极甚至犯错误的人送去“凑数”，并给这些人更改年龄、成份，在鉴定中也只写优点，不写缺点、或假报情况，隐瞒错误；个别厂矿则对符合条件，要求报考的工人，不给支持，故意说他们还不够进步、积极，需要继续在生产劳动中锻炼。这种不顾国家培养工农干部的计划，斤斤于一厂一矿利益的本位主义的作法，是必须纠正的。
    各级教育行政部门和各工农速成中学，应严格掌握报考条件，实事求是地进行审查和考试，绝不应随便降低学生质量、勉强凑数。只有历史清楚、政治条件合格、思想进步、工作积极、身体健康、年龄适当、有相当于高小毕业文化程度，并且有长期培养条件的人才能录取入学，凡是不合乎条件的一律不收。在录取新生时，首先应注意政治条件，即从政治上考虑报考人员有无培养成为建设骨干的条件和可能。其次应从长期学习的观点着眼，注意报考人员的身体健康。只有上述基本条件具备时，才能以文化程度作为录取的标准。某些学校不注意政治、健康等条件，以考试成绩作为录取的唯一标准的作法是应该纠正的。在考试问题上，还应认真地研究和执行中央教育部所颁发的工农速成中学考试大纲，按照要求出题评分，防止在文化程度上要求偏高或偏低的现象，以切实保证新生质量。
