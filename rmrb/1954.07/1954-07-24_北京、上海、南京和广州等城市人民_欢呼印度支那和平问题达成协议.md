Xinhua News Agency, July 23rd: People from all walks of life in the capital are cheering for the agreement reached at the Geneva Conference on restoring peace in Indochina. On the 22nd, two propaganda trucks from the postal bureau, loaded with that day's newspapers, raced through the streets of the capital, spreading the good news of peace to the city's residents. People surrounded the vehicles, vying to buy newspapers. The retail sales of major newspapers in the capital on this day increased nearly five times compared to usual. Crowds of people gathered in front of the street newspaper stands, discussing this exciting news.

The people of the capital know that the peaceful conclusion of the eight-year Indochina War is of great historical significance not only for the people of Indochina, but also for peace and security in Asia, and for further easing international tensions.

The workers of the state-owned Beijing No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory, which will officially start production on "August 1st," all said, "The news of the Indochina ceasefire is fantastic!" Li Xianzhang, the chief engineer of the factory, said: Peace is too important for us. The facts of the Geneva Conference prove that all international disputes can be resolved through peaceful consultation. Construction workers building the state-owned Beijing No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory heard the news from loudspeakers. Gao Zhiming, a cement worker, said: I am very happy to hear this news. We hope that there will be no more artillery fire in the world from now on. The factories and buildings we build with hard work especially need peace to protect them.

When the news reached the "Sijiqing" Vegetable Production Cooperative in the suburbs, Li Molin, the director of the cooperative, excitedly said: The Indochina armistice agreement is a victory for the peaceful diplomatic policies of China, the Soviet Union, and Vietnam. Wang Chaojin, a woman from Lugouqiao Township, specifically mentioned in her speech that we should be more vigilant in the future to prevent the conspiracies of the United States.

The famous playwright Cao Yu said: I am a theater worker, and we know that people's dramatic arts can only develop in a peaceful and democratic environment. Therefore, we not only hope that there will be no war in China, but also hope that there will be no war in every corner of Asia and the world. He also felt honored and proud of the brilliant achievements of the Chinese delegation at this important international conference. Xin Fengxia, a famous Pingju actress who is currently performing "The Volunteer Army's Fiancée" in the capital, said: I grew up in the flames of war, and I know how much suffering war can bring to the people. Now we are living a stable and happy life. In order to meet the ever-increasing cultural demands of the people, we must defend this beneficial labor and strive to consolidate the achievements of peace. The play I am performing reflects the noble spirit of the Chinese people who sacrificed themselves to defend peace in Asia.

Housewives in Mashi Street, Dongsi District, held a special discussion on this matter. A woman named Jin Zhiyuan said: Today, we are happy for the mothers of France and Vietnam, who will no longer have to worry about their children's lives.

Huang Jiasheng, director of the Beijing No. 1 Food Production Cooperative, Le Songsheng, chairman of the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce, and An Shiwei, imam of the Qingzhen Mosque, all condemned the United States' unpopular obstruction of the agreement on the Korean issue at the Geneva Conference. They hoped that major powers would continue to work together to reasonably resolve the Korean issue based on respecting the will of the Korean people.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 23rd: On the afternoon of the 22nd, 140,000 special editions of newspapers detailing the agreement reached at the Geneva Conference on restoring peace in Indochina were snapped up by Shanghai citizens in a matter of hours.

In recent days, the people of Shanghai have been closely watching the progress of the Geneva Conference. Early this morning, people were attracted by the news published in the newspapers that the three Indochinese countries had signed an agreement to cease hostilities. Many post office entrances were crowded with readers buying special editions. Cars carrying special editions were constantly surrounded by people along the road. At the entrance of the Great World, more than 500 copies were sold in only five minutes. At the entrance of the Shanghai Post Office on Sichuan Road Bridge, an old lady and her daughter finally managed to buy a special edition. Everyone was vying to read it first, tearing the newspaper. They laughed and pieced it together, reading as they walked. Everywhere in the streets, people could be seen reading the special edition on the walls with umbrellas. The announcer sent this good news into the workshops, the construction site of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Building, and the largest state-owned Shanghai No. 1 Department Store in an excited tone. Workers at the state-owned Shanghai No. 17 Cotton Textile Factory held a symposium during their break. The workers said: The agreement on restoring peace in Indochina is a great victory for the peace and democracy camp, and another shameful failure of the US imperialist policy of aggression. The scientist Lu Yudao immediately wrote an article after hearing about the agreement on restoring peace in Indochina. The article pointed out that the Indochina armistice is another victory for the forces of peace after the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement. He said: "Peace in Asia is not allowed to be undermined."

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, July 23rd: The million people of Nanjing warmly celebrate the agreement reached at the Geneva Conference on restoring peace in Indochina. On the 22nd, the Nanjing Xinhua Daily issued more than 27,600 extra copies. Every newspaper posting place in the city was crowded with people reading the newspaper. On the sidewalks and in buses, many people were engrossed in reading the newspaper. Cui Lishen, a famous technical innovator in Nanjing and a worker at the state-owned Nanjing Hydraulic Instrument Factory, recalled the painful life suffered by the people of Nanjing when Japanese imperialism invaded China after seeing this news, and said: "Only those who have experienced war can truly appreciate the preciousness of peace." Liu Congzhi, the father of Liu Hua, a special-class hero of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, said: "The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army fought against the aggression of US imperialism and finally achieved the victory of the Korean armistice. Now an agreement has been reached to restore peace in Indochina, which is another great victory. But US imperialism will never be reconciled, and we must also prevent the enemy from undermining peace." Jin Shanbao, a people's representative of Nanjing City and president of Nanjing Agricultural College, said excitedly: "The agreement on restoring peace in Indochina is another great victory after the Korean armistice, which shows that the world's peace and democracy forces are becoming increasingly powerful." He also said: The era of US imperialism monopolizing international affairs is over. International affairs, especially Asian affairs, must have China's participation to be resolved. This Geneva Conference further illustrates this point.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, July 23rd: The people of Guangzhou welcomed the agreement reached at the Geneva Conference on restoring peace in Indochina with great joy.

On the 22nd, the "Southern Daily" and "Guangzhou Daily" both published special editions carrying the news of the successful conclusion of the Geneva Conference. Workers, students, cadres, and citizens flocked to the three propaganda vehicles selling special editions, vying to buy them. In Guangzhou city alone, more than 52,500 special editions were sold.

When the people's representatives of Guangzhou City who are currently attending the preparatory meeting of the first session of the first People's Congress of Guangzhou City heard this news, they all applauded warmly. Wang Shengbao, a people's representative of Guangzhou City and a special-class labor model of Guangzhou City, said: Our people love peace, and peace allows us to engage in construction better. The realization of peace in Indochina has strengthened our confidence in completing the first five-year plan. We are determined to build Guangzhou into a socialist industrial city, realize China's socialist industrialization, and defend world peace.

Overseas Chinese returning from Indochina held a symposium on the afternoon of the 22nd after hearing the news. The participants in the symposium were returned overseas Chinese from Haiphong, Saigon, Cholon, and Cambodia in Vietnam. Chen Ruying, an overseas Chinese who had lived in Haiphong, said excitedly at the meeting: "Nothing makes me happier than this good news of peace." Chen Rong, an overseas Chinese who returned from Saigon, said: I came back from there and know how much the people of Indochina hope for peace. We overseas Chinese understand that the achievement of peace in Indochina is a victory for the peace and democracy camp, and a victory for the people who love peace. Shen Qinghe, a Cambodian returned overseas Chinese, said: We clearly know that peace is hard-won. US imperialism still tried to obstruct the realization of peace in Indochina until the very end. While we are happy, we should be more vigilant against the enemies of peace to ensure the full realization of peace in Indochina.

    北京、上海、南京和广州等城市人民
    欢呼印度支那和平问题达成协议
    【新华社二十三日讯】首都各界人民为日内瓦会议关于恢复印度支那和平达成协议而欢呼。二十二日，两辆装载着当天报纸的邮政局的宣传卡车在首都的街道上奔驰，向全市人民传播和平的喜讯。人们围着汽车争购报纸。首都各大报纸在这一天的零售份数比平时增加了将近五倍。街头的阅报栏前，拥挤着成群的人们，谈论着这个令人兴奋的消息。
    首都各界人民都知道打了八年的印度支那战争得以和平结束，这件事不仅对于印度支那人民，而且对于亚洲的和平和安全，对于进一步缓和国际紧张局势，有着多么重大的历史意义。
    将在“八一”正式投入生产的国营北京第一棉纺织厂的职工们，都说“印度支那停火的消息太好了”。这个工厂的总工程师李宪章说：和平对我们太需要了。日内瓦会议的事实证明，所有国际纠纷都可以经过和平协商的方法获得解决。正在建筑国营北京第二棉纺织厂的建筑工人，从扩音器里听到了这个消息，水泥工高志明说：听到这个消息，我非常高兴，我们希望世界上从今以后不再有炮声，我们用辛勤的劳动盖起来的工厂、大楼是特别需要和平来保护的。
    消息传到郊区“四季青”蔬菜生产合作社时，合作社主任李墨林兴奋地认为：印度支那达成停战协议，是中、苏、越三国和平外交政策的胜利。芦沟桥乡妇女王朝金在谈话中特别提到今后要提高警惕，防止美国的阴谋破坏。
    著名剧作家曹禺说：我是一个戏剧工作者，我们深知只有在和平民主的环境中才能发展人民的戏剧艺术。所以，我们不但希望中国没有战争，同时也希望亚洲、全世界每一个角落都没有战争。他并且为中国代表团在这次重要的国际会议上所获得的光辉成就，感到光荣和骄傲。正在首都演出评剧“志愿军的未婚妻”的名演员新凤霞说：我是从战争的炮火中长大的，我知道战争会给人民带来多大的苦难。现在我们过着安定、幸福的生活，为了满足人民日益高涨的文化要求，我们要保卫这种有益的劳动，就必须为巩固和平的成果而努力。我所演的这个戏就是反映了中国人民保卫亚洲和平而献身的高贵精神。
    东四区马市大街的家庭妇女们为这件事专门举行了座谈会，一位名叫金稚媛的妇女说：今天，我们为法国和越南的母亲而高兴，她们不会再为自己孩子的性命担忧了。
    北京市第一食品生产合作社主任黄嘉生、市工商业联合会主任委员乐松生和清真寺阿訇安士伟等人，一致斥责美帝国主义在日内瓦会议上不得人心的阻挠朝鲜问题达成协议的行为，他们希望各大国之间在尊重朝鲜人民的意志的基础上，继续努力合理解决朝鲜问题。
    【新华社上海二十三日电】二十二日下午，十四万份登载日内瓦会议关于恢复印度支那和平问题获得协议详情的号外，在数小时内就被上海市民争购一空。
    最近几天来，上海人民一直注视着日内瓦会议的进展。今天一早，人们都被报纸上登载的印度支那三国分别签订停止敌对行动协定的消息吸引住了。许多邮局门口挤满了买号外的读者。载送号外的汽车沿路不断地被人们包围起来，在大世界门口只五分钟左右，就销售了五百多份。在四川路桥的上海邮局门口，有一位老太太和她的女儿好容易买到一份号外，谁都争着要先看，把报纸撕破了，她们笑着又拼起来一面走一面读。街头到处可以看到人们打着雨伞在读墙上的号外。广播员用兴奋的语调把这一好消息送进车间，送到中苏友好大厦建筑工地，送到最大的国营上海市第一百货商店里。国营上海第十七棉纺织厂的工人休息时召开了座谈会，工人们说：恢复印度支那和平问题获得协议是和平民主阵营的大胜利，是美帝国主义侵略政策又一次可耻的失败。科学家卢于道听到恢复印度支那和平问题获得协议后，立即写了一篇文章，文章中指出，印度支那的停战是继朝鲜停战协定签字之后，和平力量的又一次胜利。他说：“亚洲和平是不允许破坏的。”
    【新华社南京二十三日电】南京市百万人民热烈庆祝日内瓦会议就恢复印度支那和平问题达成协议。二十二日这天，南京新华日报增发号外两万七千六百多份。全市每一个贴报处都挤满看报的人群。在行人道上，在公共汽车里，都有许多人在聚精会神地阅读报纸。南京市著名的技术革新者、国营南京水工仪器厂工人崔立身看到这个消息后，回忆起日本帝国主义侵入中国时南京人民所受到的痛苦生活，他说：“只有经历过战争的人，才真正体会到和平的宝贵。”中国人民志愿军特等功臣刘华烈士的父亲刘从芝说：“朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军打击了美帝国主义的侵略，终于取得了朝鲜停战的胜利，现在恢复印度支那的和平又达成协议，这又是一次伟大的胜利。但是美帝国主义决不会甘心，我们还要防止敌人破坏和平。”南京市人民代表、南京农学院院长金善宝兴奋地说：“恢复印度支那和平问题达成协议，是继朝鲜停战以后的又一次伟大胜利，这显示了世界和平民主力量日益无比强大。”他又说：美帝国主义垄断国际事务的时代已经过去，国际事务，特别是亚洲的事务，一定要有中国参加，才能得到解决，这次日内瓦会议又进一步说明了这个问题。
    【新华社广州二十三日电】广州市人民以万分喜悦的心情欢迎日内瓦会议在恢复印度支那和平问题上达成了协议。

    现在正在参加广州市第一届第一次人民代表大会会议预备会的广州市人民代表听到这个消息时，都热烈鼓掌。广州市人民代表、广州市特等劳动模范王生保说：我国人民是爱好和平的，和平可使我们更好地从事建设。印度支那和平的实现，使我们完成第一个五年计划的信心更加增强了。我们有决心把广州市建设成为一个社会主义的工业城市，实现我国的社会主义工业化，保卫世界和平。
    从印度支那归国的华侨听到这个消息后，在二十二日下午举行了一个座谈会，参加座谈会的有来自越南海防、西贡、堤岸和高棉等地的归国华侨。曾在海防居住过的华侨陈茹英在会上激动地说：
  “再没有比这个和平喜讯使我高兴的了。”从西贡回国的华侨陈荣说：我从那边回来，知道印度支那人民是多么希望和平。我们华侨明白：印度支那和平的取得，是和平民主阵营的胜利，是爱好和平的人民的胜利。高棉归国华侨沈清和说：我们清楚知道和平得来不易，美帝国主义直到最后仍然企图阻挠印度支那和平的实现，我们一方面高兴，一方面更应该对和平的敌人提高警惕，保证印度支那和平的全部实现。
