Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, July 12th: On July 7th, the Korean Military Armistice Commission's Korean-Chinese side received a notification from the US side stating that one of the US vessels patrolling the Han River estuary ran aground near the island of ? in the Han River estuary on the 7th, and that our side had fired upon the vessel. They requested that the First Joint Observer Team meet at Panmunjom on the 8th to conduct a joint investigation of this alleged incident.

During the Joint Observer Team's meeting on the 8th, the US side claimed that the allegedly fired-upon vessel had already returned to its base, making it impossible for the team to conduct a joint on-site investigation. The US side failed to provide any other evidence, only offering three so-called witnesses to attend the Joint Observer Team meeting to testify. These three so-called witnesses were allegedly civil police patrolling the Han River estuary area, but they were wearing yellow armbands bearing the identification insignia of general staff of the Military Armistice Commission, and not the special identification insignia that civil police are required to wear. During the meeting, the US side's members of the Joint Observer Team and the witnesses they provided recited prepared statements, answering questions in a pre-arranged manner as so-called testimony to prove the incident. When our side's members questioned these witnesses, the US side's members repeatedly and openly instructed the so-called witnesses on how to answer, repeatedly prevented our side's members from questioning them about the specific circumstances of the alleged incident, and ordered the witnesses to refuse to answer, even attempting to prevent them from marking the location of the alleged incident on a map.

During the Joint Observer Team's second meeting on July 10th, these so-called witnesses, as well as the US side's members themselves, contradicted the location of the alleged incident that they had stated during the team's first meeting. At this meeting, our side's members pointed out that the US accusation was groundless, and that our side had never fired upon any US civil police patrol vessels in the Han River estuary area. All the so-called "testimony" that the US side could provide was self-contradictory and untenable. Our side's members specifically pointed out that the US patrol vessel that allegedly suffered the shooting had supposedly already left the scene of the alleged incident, making it impossible for the Joint Observer Team to conduct an on-site investigation; civil police are required to wear specially designated insignia, but the three so-called witnesses provided by the US side were wearing the insignia of Military Armistice Commission staff, their identities did not match the US side's claims, and therefore the truthfulness of their "testimony" was questionable. Finally, our side's members solemnly rejected the US accusation and declared that they would submit a report from our side's members of the First Joint Observer Team to the Military Armistice Commission regarding this US accusation, which had been proven to be without factual basis during the joint investigation.

    美方诬控我方射击巡逻艇事件经再次调查证明纯系美方捏造
    联合小组我方组员指出美方指控毫无根据
   【新华社开城十二日电】朝鲜军事停战委员会朝中方面于七月七日接获美方通知说，美方在汉江口巡逻的船只一艘，七日在汉江口?岛附近搁浅，我方曾向这只船射击，要求第一联合观察小组于八日在板门店会晤，对此据称的事件进行共同调查。
    八日联合观察小组会晤时，由于美方声称所据称被射击的船只已经驶回其基地，小组无法赴现场进行共同调查，而美方又提不出任何其他证据，仅提供三名所谓证人列席联合观察小组会议作证，这三名所谓证人据称系在汉江口区域担任巡逻的民政警察，但他们却佩带着军事停战委员会一般工作人员的识别徽记的黄臂章，而并非佩带特别规定民政警察应佩带的识别徽记。会上联合观察小组的美方组员和他所提供的证人，都就事先准备好的稿子照本宣科，一问一答，作为证明事件经过的所谓证词。当我方组员向这些证人提出询问时，美方组员就不得不几次公然向所谓证人授意如何作答，几次阻止我方组员向他们询问据称发生事件时的具体情况，并命令他所提供的证人拒绝答复，甚至企图阻止他们在地图上标出据称发生事件的地点。
    七月十日联合观察小组第二次会晤时，这些所谓证人以及美方组员本人，又推翻了他们在小组第一次会晤时所说的据称发生事件地点的位置。在这天会上，我方组员指出：美方的指控毫无根据，我方根本未曾向任何在汉江口区域内的美方民政警察巡逻船只射击。美方所能提供的全部所谓“证词”都是自相矛盾、站不住脚的。我方组员并具体指出：据称遭受射击的美方的巡逻船据称早已离开据称发生事件的现场，联合观察小组无法进行现场调查；民政警察佩带特别规定的徽记，但美方所提供的三名所谓证人系佩带军事停战委员会工作人员的徽记，他们的身份与美方所说不符，因而他们的“证词”的真实性是有问题的。最后我方组员严正地拒绝了美方的指控，并声明将就这一在联合调查过程中已经证明为毫无事实根据的美方指控，向军事停战委员会提出第一联合观察小组我方组员的报告。
