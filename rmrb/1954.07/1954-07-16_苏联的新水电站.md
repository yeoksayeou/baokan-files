    New Soviet Hydroelectric Power Stations
    Academician of the Soviet Academy of Sciences Ya. Ventzel, Engineer A. Malkin
    Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Soviet people have achieved great accomplishments in our country’s electrification endeavors. The Soviet Union's electricity generation has leaped from fifteenth to second place in the world, first in Europe, and ranks first in the world in terms of the speed of electricity production growth and the commissioning of new generating capacity. Now, we generate more electricity in one and a half days than all power stations in the entire country generated in the entire year of 1921, the first year of the implementation of the All-Russian Electrification Plan. Last year, in 1953, Soviet power stations generated more than 133 billion kilowatt-hours, which is 68 times that of 1913.
    During the Fifth Five-Year Plan, the scale of development of the Soviet Union's electrification is unprecedented. The total generating capacity of Soviet power stations will double in five years, meaning that the generating capacity added in five years will be equal to the entire generating capacity achieved in our history of electrification. No capitalist country can propose such a massive plan for developing electricity.
    The achievements of electrification are closely linked to modern technical processes and the great improvement of labor productivity.
    Our industry, which possesses a large number of electric machines, currently requires about 70 percent of all the electricity we produce. In addition to being used as power, electricity also has great practical significance in terms of heat, chemical action, and other effects. The degree of electrification of machinery in Soviet industry has surpassed that of the United States, and other capitalist countries are even further behind.
    Electricity has also been effectively utilized in many agricultural production processes. The total generating capacity of all rural power stations in the country has exceeded 1.5 million kilowatts. Many collective farms, state farms, and machine tractor stations have been incorporated into the national power system. One-fifth of the collective farms, 90 percent of the state farms, and 95 percent of the machine tractor stations have been electrified.
    Electrification is the most important method for improving the productivity of railway transportation. The Soviet Union ranks first in the world in terms of the speed of railway electrification and the length of railways that have been electrified. During the Fifth Five-Year Plan, the length of electrified railways will quadruple.
    From the very beginning of the establishment of Soviet power, the Party and the government have paid close attention to the construction of hydroelectric power. The reason for the widespread construction of hydroelectric power stations is that it has great advantages. As everyone knows, under our country's conditions, the level of development of productive forces depends to a large extent on the state of the domestic power base. The Party also considered that the advanced technology in various sectors of the national economy is based on the use of electricity and the electrification of production processes. Hydro resources are an inexhaustible and continuously renewing source of power. Hydroelectric power stations can save fuel and rationalize the production and consumption of fuel throughout the country. In addition, it can greatly shorten the fuel transportation distance. To generate the same amount of electricity, hydroelectric power stations use approximately 96.67 to 97.5 percent less labor than thermal power stations. Hydroelectric power is about 67 to 90 percent cheaper than thermal power. In 1949, the average cost of hydroelectric power in the Soviet Union was 85.8 percent lower than the power cost of thermal power stations. Therefore, although the investment in building hydroelectric power stations is high, it recovers costs much faster than thermal power stations. The cost recovery period generally does not exceed ten years. Moreover, the advantages of hydroelectric power are not limited to this.
    Hydroelectric power stations, due to the large amount of cheap electricity they generate, promote the overall development of the national economy and technological progress. The cheapness of electricity generated by hydroelectric power stations allows for the widespread implementation of power technology in production. The availability of large amounts of cheap hydro power makes it possible to develop industries that require large amounts of electricity (ferroalloys, aluminum, manganese, nitrogen, synthetic rubber, etc.). In addition, hydro power can be used to develop new production, and it is a condition for creating and developing new industrial zones.
    The enormous superiority of the socialist economic system over the capitalist economic system makes it possible for us to solve a broad task: comprehensively utilizing our country's rivers for power, navigation, irrigation, water supply, fisheries, etc., thereby combining the interests of various sectors of the national economy on a massive scale. This guarantees a large savings of people's funds compared to capitalist countries, which use water resources in a one-sided and limited way only for power, navigation, and irrigation.
    The Soviet Union's hydro power resources rank first in the world, several times more than the hydro resources of the United States and Canada. Our country's hydro resources far exceed those of the whole of Europe. There are 108,500 large and small rivers in the Soviet Union that have names and have been marked on maps. Among them, 1,500 large rivers have a generating capacity of 300 million kilowatts. They can generate 2 trillion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually. The potential reserve of hydro power in the Soviet Union is even greater—3.7 trillion kilowatt-hours per year.
    Approximately 1,800 hydroelectric power stations can be built on the rivers of the Soviet Union, with a total generating capacity of over 100 million kilowatts. These hydroelectric power stations can generate 700 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually in the future, saving our country the labor of millions of people and 700 million tons of natural fuel. Transporting these fuels would require 600,000 fuel-transporting trains. In addition, about 20,000 smaller hydroelectric power stations can be built to electrify agriculture.
    During the Fifth Five-Year Plan, the construction of hydroelectric power stations in the Soviet Union is of enormous scale. From 1951 to 1955, the total generating capacity of hydroelectric power stations across the country will double. A central task in the construction of hydroelectric power stations during the Fifth Five-Year Plan is the world's largest power base—the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Power Station on the Volga River.
    It should be particularly pointed out that the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Power Station, as well as the Stalingrad Hydroelectric Power Station, are the largest links in the comprehensive utilization of this great Russian river. During the Soviet period, precise investigations and studies have been conducted to solve the "Great Volga" problem. What is the "Great Volga"? This is the plan to fully and comprehensively utilize the entire Volga River. During the Second Five-Year Plan, the first stage was completed, which is the uppermost stage of the giant Volga River ladder—the Ivankovo hydro engineering hub, which formed the Moscow Sea. In 1940, the second stage—the Uglich Hydroelectric Power Station—was put into production. At the beginning of the Great Patriotic War, the powerful Shcherbakov Hydroelectric Power Station's turbines generated electricity. Now, the fourth stage—the Gorky Hydroelectric Power Station—is being completed; the construction of the fifth stage—the Cheboksary Hydroelectric Power Station—is being planned near Cheboksary. The powerful Kuibyshev hydro engineering hub is the sixth stage. The next stage of the Volga River is the Stalingrad Hydroelectric Power Station. However, this has not exhausted the potential of the Volga River.
    In a few more years, the Volga River ladder will possess an enormous amount of power-generating capacity. The generating capacity of hydroelectric power stations on the Volga River exceeds the generating capacity of all 45 hydroelectric power stations on the Tennessee River in the United States several times over. The United States spent half a century building these hydroelectric power stations, and American propaganda has been boasting about it as "the miracle on the Tennessee River of this century."
    The world's largest Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Power Station will be put into production by the end of the Fifth Five-Year Plan. Its generating capacity is 2.1 million kilowatts. The annual electricity generation of this hydroelectric power station is 11 billion kilowatt-hours—six times the electricity generation of all power stations in pre-revolutionary Russia.
    After the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Power Station is put into production, it can greatly improve the power supply situation in the central region and the Volga River basin. It will use electricity to irrigate the arid areas on the east bank of the Volga River. Navigation on the Volga River will also be improved. In this way, this hydro engineering hub will be a new type of, truly massive, and comprehensive model for utilizing water resources, as it solves the tasks of power, irrigation, navigation, and climate improvement.
    The Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Power Station is a vast and inexhaustible source of power. If a thermal power station were to generate 11 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity, it would need to produce and consume at least 10,000 trains of coal each year. If these trains were linked together, they would be 4,000 kilometers long. Extracting and transporting these fuels, as well as operating thermal power stations with corresponding generating capacity, would require 40,000 to 50,000 workers. The Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Power Station only needs about 500 staff members. The cost of electricity from this hydroelectric power station is 75 to 80 percent cheaper than the cost of electricity from thermal power stations.
    In the past three or four years, 37 featherweight turbines will be manufactured for the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Power Station and the Stalingrad Hydroelectric Power Station. The maximum generating capacity of each turbine is 126,000 kilowatts, which is half as much again as the generating capacity of the turbines used in the post-war Dnieper Hydroelectric Power Station. Some of the materials about these largest machines in the world are amazing. Under enormous pressure, 600 to 700 cubic meters of water will pass through the turbine per second. The diameter of the turbine's working wheel is more than nine meters long. The total weight of the turbine is 1,600 tons. In addition, factories will also design and manufacture a large number of giant turbines for other huge hydroelectric power stations being built on the Volga River, the Kama River, the Dnieper River, the Ob River, the Irtysh River, and the Angara River.
    The construction of the enormous Kuibyshev hydro engineering hub in soft soil areas is a major victory in Soviet hydraulic engineering worthy of being recorded in the world's technical history. The transmission equipment from Kuibyshev to Moscow, which will be built during this five-year plan, is also a major event in world engineering. Electricity with a capacity of over one million kilowatts will be sent 900 kilometers away along this unprecedentedly powerful transmission equipment at a high voltage of 400,000 volts.
    The Gorky Hydroelectric Power Station will also be put into production during this five-year plan period. It is an important stage in the entire ladder, including many hydroelectric power stations, for solving the "Great Volga" problem. The powerful Gorky Hydroelectric Power Station will assist the Moscow power system and improve the power supply situation in our motherland's capital. The Gorky hydro engineering hub is composed of several parts: a hydroelectric power station, a concrete flood spillway dam, an earth dam, and navigation equipment. The total length of the backwater front is about 13 kilometers. New technologies, such as ejector-type water level reduction, vibration pile driving, and radial cable cranes with a span of 800 meters, have been widely used in the construction project.
    The Stalingrad Hydroelectric Power Station on the Volga River is slightly smaller than the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Power Station in terms of generating capacity. The generating capacity of the Stalingrad Hydroelectric Power Station is 1.7 million kilowatts. However, its power generation is about the same as that of the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Power Station. The power generation in the average water year (i.e., the period when the amount of water is normal) is about 10 billion kilowatt-hours.
    The Stalingrad hydro engineering hub, which has enormous hydraulic engineering construction, also has the function of irrigating arid fields. The dam of the Stalingrad Hydroelectric Power Station raises the water level of the Volga River a lot and extends the backwater hundreds of kilometers upstream along the Volga River. The Stalingrad Reservoir will hold 33 cubic kilometers of water. The reservoir is 600 kilometers long and 30 kilometers wide. Rice, cotton, rubber plants, beans, and fruit trees will be planted on the irrigated fields. Animal husbandry, mainly sheep farming, will be developed in the water supply area. The Salbinsk Basin, the Black Earth Belt, and the Nogai Steppe are extremely fertile bases for developing highly productive animal husbandry.
    A huge hydroelectric power station is also being built in the Kakhovka area. Its turbine has a generating capacity of 250,000 kilowatts, and the power generation in the average water year is about 1.2 billion kilowatt-hours. A railway bridge across the Dnieper River will be built on the Kakhovka dam. The Kakhovka Hydroelectric Power Station can guarantee the electrification of agriculture and promote the establishment of a permanent feed base for the development of public animal husbandry. After the Kakhovka hydro engineering hub is completed, it can improve navigation on the entire downstream of the Dnieper River from the Dnieper Hydroelectric Power Station to Kakhovka and south of the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Power Station.
    Solving the "Great Volga" problem is linked to the work of reconstructing the joint water area, because the Volga River is the backbone of our motherland's unified waterway economic system.
    The first huge hydroelectric power station in the Urals—the Kama Hydroelectric Power Station built near Molotov City on the Kama River, a tributary of the Volga River—will generate electricity this year.
    The Kama Hydroelectric Power Station is a major contribution to the development of the power base of Ural industry, and it will also promote the great improvement of the industrial and agricultural sectors in this wealthy border area. After the Kama hydro engineering hub is completed, it can also solve other national economic problems. The Molotov Reservoir is formed above the dam of the hydroelectric power station, and the reservoir area reaches 200,000 hectares. Its total length, including the tributaries of the Kama River, exceeds 900 kilometers. This will help solve the major task of improving the conditions of the navigable transportation system in the European part of the Soviet Union.
    The power plant of this hydroelectric power station is combined with the flood spillway dam, and the flood will be discharged through the power plant. This completely eliminates the need to build an additional flood spillway dam and can greatly reduce concrete works. In the construction project of the hydroelectric power station, the rapid installation method of large-scale combined structures is adopted, and the progress of the construction and installation projects is coordinated with each other. The construction workers shortened the construction period and saved materials.
    The Mingechaur Hydroelectric Power Station, one of the largest hydroelectric power stations in the Soviet Union built on the Kura River in the Azerbaijan Republic, began to be put into production at the beginning of 1954. This hydroelectric power station solves a series of major national economic problems. It can guarantee the electricity consumption of Baku and other industrial areas in Azerbaijan; help irrigate more than one million hectares of land in the Kura-Araks lowland; guarantee the vigorous improvement of the entire economy of the Azerbaijan Republic and the fundamental transformation of agriculture. The Mingechaur hydro engineering hub can not only supply the national economy with cheap electricity, but also can jointly reclaim hundreds of thousands of hectares of land that are now barren with the Kura-Araks irrigation system to plant wheat, cotton, and other crops and establish a reliable feed base for public livestock breeding. The large amount of water and the turbulent Kura River can be subdued, and a large reservoir with a capacity of 16 billion cubic meters can be established, which can greatly improve navigation conditions. The Mingechaur Sea is 75 kilometers long and 13 kilometers wide. The earth dam of the Mingechaur hydro engineering hub is one of the largest earth dams in the world. In order to lift the gate on the side of the turbine, a hydraulic crane capable of lifting 300 tons was used for the first time.
    The powerful Shulbinsk Hydroelectric Power Station has been put into production in the upper reaches of the Irtysh River in Kazakhstan, and the construction of another hydroelectric power station—the Bukhtarma Hydroelectric Power Station—has begun. These two hydroelectric power stations on the Irtysh River will supply cheap electricity to the industry that processes the large amount of non-ferrous metal minerals in the Altai Mountains and the agriculture in eastern Kazakhstan. A 430-kilometer section of the upper reaches of the Irtysh River (from Zaysan Lake to Shulbinsk City) is a very attractive target for building hydroelectric power stations. The Irtysh River absorbs the melting snow water from the Altai Mountains and passes through the vast Zaysan Lake. The Irtysh River has a uniform annual and multi-year runoff (commonly known as
  "water volume"—translator). Sluice gates will be built in each hydroelectric power station to facilitate the passage of ships. A huge reservoir will be formed above the Bukhtarma Hydroelectric Power Station, which will ensure sufficient regulation of the river's water volume. Therefore, the hydroelectric power stations on the Irtysh River do not need thermal power backup (referring to the backup thermal power capacity—translator). A large dam will also be built between the towering granite cliffs, and this dam will form a vast reservoir that is 500 kilometers long. The water level of Zaysan Lake can therefore be raised by almost 10 meters.
    The construction project of the huge Novosibirsk Hydroelectric Power Station has been launched on the Ob River near Novosibirsk City. This hydroelectric power station will play a huge role in the electrification of the national economy in neighboring areas. The Novosibirsk Hydroelectric Power Station will supply cheap electricity and improve navigation on the Ob River. A reservoir 240 kilometers long and about 20 kilometers wide will be formed here.
    The Gyumush Hydroelectric Power Station in Armenia, the most important stage of the Sevan Cascade, has been completed.
    During the Fifth Five-Year Plan, the project of utilizing the power resources on the Angara River has been launched on a large scale in order to develop the aluminum industry, the chemical industry, the mining industry, and other industries by utilizing cheap electricity bases and local raw material sources. The construction project of the first powerful Angara Hydroelectric Power Station is proceeding at full speed.
    The construction of hydroelectric power stations on some large rivers in Siberia is of great significance to the Soviet people.
    Indeed, if you open a map of the Soviet Union and take a look, the entire upper region from the Urals to the Pacific Ocean is Siberia, a place with unlimited prospects. This is a land and sea that is twice as large as the European part of the Soviet Union, and its underground and above-ground resources are countless and almost untouched.
    During the several five-year plans after the war, large-scale work was carried out in Siberia. Following Comrade Stalin's instructions, the Soviet state formulated a large-scale strategic plan to conquer the nature of Siberia. The huge Ural-Kuznetsk Integrated Plant has been built. Relying on the capabilities of this integrated plant, the Soviet people continue to advance eastward. Crossing the Ural Mountains is Western Siberia. The vast Siberian Basin will be the future world center of wheat production and animal husbandry, and it will produce more wheat and livestock products than the United States currently produces. To the east of the Yenisei River is Eastern Siberia, a region with huge hydro power resources, 5,000 kilometers from Moscow and 3,000 kilometers from the Pacific Ocean. The Angara River, the Yenisei River, and the Lena River, these world-renowned rivers, contain inestimable power. This power can help the Soviet people develop the countless resources of Siberia.
    What role will the Angara River play in the great task of transforming Siberia?
    For many years, the Angara River and Lake Baikal, which nourishes it, have attracted the attention of our country's scientists and engineers. Lake Baikal is the largest freshwater lake in Eurasia and one of the deepest lakes in the world. It is 600 kilometers long and has an average width of 60 kilometers. Lake Baikal is a huge reservoir that holds more water than the Baltic Sea. More than 300 large and small rivers flow into Lake Baikal, but only one Angara River originates from Lake Baikal. The electricity that the Angara River and its tributaries can generate is greater than the electricity of all power stations in France, Italy, Sweden, Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain, and Denmark combined.
    Lake Baikal can regulate the flow of the Angara River. Therefore, the hydroelectric power stations on the Angara River can operate at full capacity almost all year round (referring to the constant water volume throughout the year), generating the cheapest electricity in the world. Building hydroelectric power stations on the Angara River is easier and cheaper than building them on other rivers.
    The amount of earthwork and concrete work required to build a hydroelectric power station here is several times less than that required to build a hydroelectric power station with the same generating capacity in other places.
    The 19th Party Congress instructed that industries that consume a lot of electricity must be established in the Angara River region first. A large amount of cheap electricity will be used to electrify industry, transportation, and agriculture. A large amount of electricity will improve the lives of residents in cities and collective farms. In addition, the continuous waterway from Lake Baikal to the Arctic Ocean will help develop the timber resources of Siberia, which is our country's main forest region.
    The Soviet people, led by the Party, are launching a large-scale offensive against nature. A lot of work has been done in this regard. New construction projects have sprung up everywhere on the vast continent. The Siberians are welcoming the work plan on the Angara River with great excitement and new labor victories. Powerful excavators have been working on the riverbank. Even at night, under the light of floodlights, work is still going on non-stop. Many Soviet scientists led by the Soviet Academy of Sciences have come to help with the construction.
    The decision of the 19th Party Congress to start work on the Angara River caused panic among the enemies of the Soviet people. They have repeatedly said that the Soviet regime cannot utilize the Angara River. Now their hopes have been dashed. The Angara River will serve the Soviet people!
    The decision of the 19th Party Congress to complete the Narva Hydroelectric Power Station and launch the construction project of the Kaunas Hydroelectric Power Station during the Fifth Five-Year Plan is of special significance to the three Soviet republics on the Baltic coast.
    During the Fifth Five-Year Plan, the scale and speed of Soviet hydraulic construction projects are particularly obvious compared to the first few years of developing our country's hydro power.
    The Volkhov Hydroelectric Power Station with a generating capacity of 56,000 kilowatts took eight years to build. It took the "Electricity" Electrical Equipment Factory almost five years to build the hydraulic generators for the Volkhov Hydroelectric Power Station, while the three powerful hydraulic generators of the Tsimlyansk Hydroelectric Power Station, which has a generating capacity far exceeding that of the entire Volkhov Hydroelectric Power Station, were successfully manufactured in one year in 1951. The first unit took two months and eighteen days, the second unit took two months, and the third unit took one month and eighteen days.
    The many experiences accumulated in the Soviet hydro power construction projects in Volkhov, Svir, Dnieper, and other places have ensured the rapid development speed and widespread scale of our country's modern hydro power industry.
    Currently, 17 percent of the electricity produced by power stations in various regions is produced by hydroelectric power stations. This is a brilliant achievement of Soviet power engineering. However, our hydroelectric power stations have only utilized 1/150th of the Soviet Union's extremely rich hydro resources. Our country's power engineering faces the important task of utilizing these resources.
    The new hydroelectric power stations will be equipped with machines that can minimize the labor required to convert river power into electricity. Fully automating hydroelectric power stations and improving the efficiency of all equipment are only part of solving the major problem of rationally using power resources. The main problem is that the design work of hydroelectric power stations must maximize the acceleration of the construction of hydroelectric power stations and reduce the investment in hydroelectric power stations.
    Once a hydroelectric power station is built, it only requires a small amount of labor to generate electricity. Compared with thermal power stations, the labor required for each kilowatt-hour of electricity generated by hydroelectric power stations is 96.67 to 97.5 percent less than that of thermal power stations. This shows to what extent labor productivity can be improved by utilizing river power in terms of power economics. However, on the other hand, the labor used to build a hydroelectric power station is much greater than the labor used to build a thermal power station. Of course, the faster we build our hydroelectric power stations and the lower their construction costs, the higher the economic effect of our hydraulic construction projects will be when we quickly put them into production and fully utilize their power.
    Another task is to manufacture new hydraulic linkages and components of buildings that can greatly reduce the cost of hydroelectric power stations. Correctly organizing work and adopting rapid working methods are also of great significance. Prolonging the construction of hydroelectric power stations will greatly reduce their economic efficiency. The rapid construction of hydroelectric power stations and the rapid use of the electricity they produce in production have great national economic effects in terms of improving labor productivity.
    This is why hydroelectric workers must work together now and in the future to solve a series of major problems, primarily to solve the problem of how to quickly build hydroelectric power stations by rapidly building dams, tunnels, and channels in various different natural conditions, as well as by adopting blasting work and other methods.
    The Communist Party believes that electrification is of great significance in creating the abundant products and consumer goods necessary to transition to a communist society. G. M. Malenkov recently said at the meeting of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union: "Our most important current national economic task is to continue to promote electrification at a speed and scale that enables the increase in electricity generation to exceed the development speed and scale of other economic sectors." The new plan formulated by the Party to vigorously improve labor productivity is being implemented, and our motherland is moving towards a bright and brilliant future, when Lenin's great legacy—communism is Soviet power plus national electrification—will become a reality.

    苏联的新水电站
    苏联科学院院士　亚·文捷尔  工程师  阿·马尔金
    共产党领导下的苏联人民在我国电气化事业中取得了巨大的成就。苏联的发电量已由世界的第十五位跃居第二位，为欧洲的第一位，而就电力生产增长和新发电能力投入生产的速度来说，则居世界第一位。现在，我们在一天半的时间内发出的电力就比开始执行全俄电气化计划的第一年——一九二一年全年全国所有发电站的发出的电力还要多。去年，一九五三年苏联发电站发出的电力在一千三百三十亿瓩时以上，也就是说增为一九一三年的六十八倍。
    在第五个五年计划期间，苏联电气化事业发展的规模是空前的。苏联发电站的总发电能力在五年中将增为两倍，就是说五年中增加的发电能力将等于我国电气化发展史中所得到的全部发电能力。没有一个资本主义国家能够提出这样庞大的发展电力的计划。
    电气化的成绩是与现代化的技术过程和劳动生产率的大大提高密切联系着的。
    拥有大量电动机器的我国工业在目前所需要的电力约占我们所生产的全部电力的百分之七十。电流除去用作动力以外，在热力、化学作用和其他作用方面也有巨大的实际意义。苏联工业按照机器的电气化的程度来说，已超过了美国，而其他资本主义国家更是望尘莫及。
    在农业的许多生产过程中也卓有成效地利用了电力。全国所有农村发电站的发电能力已超过一百五十万瓩。有许多集体农庄、国营农场和机器拖拉机站已纳入了国家动力系统。有五分之一的集体农庄、百分之九十的国营农场和百分之九十五的机器拖拉机站都已电气化了。
    电气化是提高铁路运输生产率的最重要的方法。以铁路电气化的速度和已经电气化的铁路的长度来说，苏联都占世界第一位。在第五个五年计划期中，电气化的铁路的长度将增为四倍。
    从苏维埃政权建立之初，党和政府就十分注意水力发电的建设。其所以要广泛地展开水电站的建设，是由于它有很大的优越性。大家知道，在我国的条件下生产力发展的水平在很大程度上要以国内动力基地的状况为转移。党还考虑到，国民经济各部门的完善的、先进的技术是要以使用电力和生产过程电气化为基础的。水力资源是动力的取之不竭的和循环不已的泉源。水力发电站可以节省燃料，可以使全国的燃料的生产和消耗合理化。此外，它还可以大大地缩短燃料的运程。发出同样多的电力，水力发电站要比火力发电站少用约百分之九十六点六七到百分之九十七点五的劳动力。水力发电要比火力发电便宜约百分之六十七到百分之九十。一九四九年苏联水力发电的平均成本要比火力发电站的动力成本低百分之八十五点八。因此，建筑水电站的投资额虽高，但它收回成本的速度要远比火力发电站大得多。收回成本的时期一般不超过十年。况且水力发电的优点还不止于此。
    水电站由于发出了大量廉价的电力，促进了国民经济的全面发展和技术进步。水电站发出的电力由于花费低廉，可以在生产中广泛地实行电力技术。由于有了大量的廉价的水力动力，使得发展需要大宗电量的生产（铁合金、铝、锰、氮、人造橡胶等）成为可能。此外，水力动力还可用来发展新的生产，它是创建和发展新的工业区的条件。
    社会主义经济体系对于资本主义经济体系的巨大优越性，使我们有可能解决一个广泛的任务：将我国的河流全面地利用在动力、航运、灌溉、供水、渔业等方面，从而把国民经济各部门的利益在巨大的规模上结合起来。这比起资本主义国家来可以保证大量地节约人民资金。资本主义国家是只在动力、航运和灌溉方面片面而有限地使用着水力资源的。
    苏联河流的水力动力的富源占世界第一位，要比美国和加拿大的水力资源多好几倍。我国的水力资源远远地超过全欧的水力资源。在苏联境内有名称的并已画到地图上去的大小河流有十万零八千五百条。其中一千五百条大河流的发电能力就有三亿瓩。它们每年能够发出二万亿瓩时的电力。苏联境内水力动力的可能的后备资源比这还要大——每年三万七千亿瓩时。
    在苏联各条河流上能建造约一千八百座水电站，其总发电能力在一亿瓩以上。这些水电站将来每年的发电量可达七千亿瓩时，能使我国节省数百万人的劳动力和七亿吨的自然燃料，要运输这些燃料还需要六十万列运燃料的列车。除此以外，还可以建造约二万个使农业电气化的发电能力较小的水电站。
    在第五个五年计划期间，苏联水电站建筑工程具有庞大的规模。从一九五一年到一九五五年全国水电站的总发电能力可增加两倍。第五个五年计划中水电站建筑工程中的一项中心工作，就是世界上最大的动力基地——伏尔加河上的古比雪夫水电站。
    应该特别提出，古比雪夫水电站以及斯大林格勒水电站是全面地利用这条伟大的俄罗斯河流的规模最大的环节。在苏维埃政权时期中，已进行精密的调查研究来解决“大伏尔加”问题。什么是“大伏尔加”呢？这就是充分地、全面地利用整个伏尔加河的计划。在第二个五年计划期间建成了第一梯级，也就是巨大的伏尔加河阶梯的最上游的一个梯级——形成了莫斯科海的伊凡科沃水力综合工程枢纽。一九四零年第二梯级——乌格利奇水电站投入生产了。在伟大卫国战争初期，强大的谢巴科夫水电站的水轮机发电了。现在，第四梯级——高尔基水电站正在完成；在契鲍克萨利附近正在计划第五梯级——契鲍克萨利水电站的建筑工程。强大的古比雪夫水力综合工程枢纽是第六梯级。伏尔加河的下一梯级就是斯大林格勒水电站。可是，这还没有用尽伏尔加河的潜在能力。
    再过几年以后，伏尔加河的阶梯将拥有庞大无比的发出动力的能力。伏尔加河上水电站的发电能力超过美国田纳西河上所有四十五个水电站的发电能力好几倍，美国建筑这些水电站花去半个世纪的时间，而美国的宣传却大吹大擂地把它说成是“本世纪田纳西河上的奇迹”。
    世界上最大的古比雪夫水电站将在第五个五年计划结束时投入生产。它的发电能力为二百一十万瓩。这一水电站每年的发电量为一百一十亿瓩时——为革命前俄国所有发电站的发电量的六倍。
    古比雪夫水电站投入生产后，可以使中部地区和伏尔加河流域的动力供应状况有很大的改进。它将利用电力来灌溉伏尔加河东岸的干旱地区。伏尔加河上的航运工作也将改善。这一来，这一水力综合工程枢纽将是新型的、真正庞大无比的、全面利用水力资源的典范，因为它解决了动力、灌溉、航运和改良气候的任务。
    古比雪夫水电站是用之不竭的动力的巨大的泉源。如果要用火力发电站发出一百一十亿瓩时的电力，每年就至少需要生产和消耗一万列列车的煤。这些列车如果连挂起来有四千公里长。要开采和运输这些燃料以及用有相应发电能力的火力发电站进行工作，就需要四万到五万个工人。而古比雪夫水电站只要约五百个工作人员就可以了。这个水力发电站的电力成本要比火力发电站的电力成本便宜百分之七十五到百分之八十。
    在最近三、四年中将给古比雪夫水电站和斯大林格勒水电站制造三十七部轻翼型水轮机，每部水轮机的最大发电能力为十二万六千瓩，这比战后第聂伯水电站所用的水轮机的发电能力要多一半。关于这些世界上最大的机器的一些材料是令人惊奇的。在巨大的压力下每秒钟通过水轮机的水将有六百到七百立方公尺。水轮机工作轮的直径有九公尺多长。水轮机的总重量为一千六百吨。此外，各工厂还要替正在伏尔加河、卡马河、第聂伯河、鄂毕河、额尔齐斯、安加拉河上建造的其他巨大的水电站设计和制造大量的巨型水轮机。
    在松软的土壤地带建造庞大无比的古比雪夫水力综合工程枢纽，这是足以载入世界技术史册的苏联水力工程上的一大胜利。将在这个五年计划期间建成的从古比雪夫到莫斯科的输电装置，也是世界工程学方面的一件大事。能力在一百万瓩以上的电力将以四十万伏特的高压沿这个空前强大的输电装置送到九百公里的远处。
    高尔基水电站也将在这一个五年计划期中投入生产，它是解决“大伏尔加”问题的包括许多水电站的整个阶梯中的一个重要的梯级。强大的高尔基水电站将辅助莫斯科动力系统，改进我们祖国首都的供电状况。高尔基水力综合工程枢纽是由这样几部分构成的：水电站、混凝土溢洪道大堤、土堤和通航设备。壅水前沿的全长约达十三公里。在建筑工程中广泛采用了新的技术，如排射式降低水位，振动下桩法，跨距为八百公尺的辐射式吊索起重机等。
    伏尔加河上的斯大林格勒水电站按其发电能力来说略次于古比雪夫水电站。斯大林格勒水电站的发电能力是一百七十万瓩。但是它的发电量却和古比雪夫水电站差不多，中水年（按即水量通常的时期）的发电量约为一百亿瓩时。
    具有庞大的水力工程建筑的斯大林格勒水力综合工程枢纽也具有灌溉干旱田地的功用。斯大林格勒水电站的堤坝使伏尔加河的水位提高很多，并回水向伏尔加河上游延伸几百公里。斯大林格勒水库将容纳三十三立方公里的水。水库长达六百公里，宽达三十公里。在被灌溉的田地上将种植大米、棉花、橡胶植物、豆类和果木。在供水地区将发展畜牧业，主要是牧羊业。萨尔宾斯克盆地、黑土地带和诺加伊草原就是发展产品率很高的畜牧业的极丰茂的基地。
    卡霍夫卡地区也在建筑巨大的水电站。它的水轮机的发电能力为二十五万瓩，中水年的发电量约十二亿瓩时。在卡霍夫卡堤坝上将建筑一座穿越第聂伯河的铁路桥。卡霍夫卡水电站可以保证使农业电气化，促进发展公共畜牧业的永久的饲料基地的建立。卡霍夫卡水力综合工程枢纽建成后，可以改善从第聂伯水电站到卡霍夫卡以及卡霍夫卡水电站以南的第聂伯河整个下游的航运。
    解决“大伏尔加”问题是和改建联合水区的工作联系在一起的，因为伏尔加河是我们祖国的统一的水道经济系统的中坚。
    乌拉尔的第一座巨大的水力发电站——在伏尔加河支流卡马河上莫洛托夫城附近建造的卡马水电站今年将要发电了。
    卡马水电站对发展乌拉尔工业的动力基地是一重大贡献，它并将促进这个富有的边区的工农业各部门的大大提高。卡马水力综合工程枢纽建成后，还可以解决其他一些国民经济上的问题。在水电站堤坝上面形成莫洛托夫水库，水库面积达二十万公顷。它的全长、连卡马河支流在内超过九百公里。这就有助于解决改善苏联欧洲部分通航运输系统的条件这样一个重大的任务。
    这个水电站的电力厂和溢洪道大堤结合在一起，洪水将经过电力厂宣泄，这就可以完全不用另外建筑溢洪道大堤，可大大地减少混凝土工程。在水电站建筑工程中，采用大件组合结构的快速安装法，把建筑和安装两项工程的进度互相配合起来了。建筑工人既缩短了建筑的期限又节省了材料。
    在阿塞拜疆共和国的库拉河上建造的苏联最大的水电站之一——明格查乌尔水电站在一九五四年初已开始投入生产了。这一水电站解决了一系列重大的国民经济问题，它可以保证巴库和阿塞拜疆其他工业区的用电；帮助灌溉库拉—阿拉克斯低地的一百多万公顷的田地；保证大力提高阿塞拜疆共和国的整个经济和根本改造农业。明格查乌尔水力综合工程枢纽不仅可以以廉价的电力供应国民经济需要，而且可以和库拉—阿拉克斯灌溉系统共同来开垦数十万公顷现在荒废的田地，来种植小麦、棉花和其他农作物，建立公共饲畜业用的可靠的饲料基地。使水量很大的和波涛汹涌的库拉河就范，并建立起容量为一百六十亿立方公尺的大水库，就可以大大地改善航运的条件。明格查乌尔海长达七十五公里，宽十三公里。明格查乌尔水力综合工程枢纽的土堤是世界上最大的土堤之一。为了提升水轮机侧的闸门，第一次使用了能起重三百吨的水压起重机。
    在哈萨克的额尔齐斯河上游，强大的石山口水电站已投入生产，现已开始建造另外一个水电站——布赫塔马水电站。额尔齐斯河上的这两个水电站将以廉价的电力供给对阿尔泰山区大量的多种金属矿产进行加工的工业和哈萨克东部的农业。额尔齐斯河上游四百三十公里的一段（从斋桑泊到石山口城）是十分吸引人的建设水电站的目标。额尔齐斯河吸取了阿尔泰山区融雪的水分，穿过辽阔的斋桑泊，额尔齐斯河具有全年和多年均匀的迳流（俗称
  “水量”——译者）。在每个水电站都将建造起水闸以便于船只通行。在布赫塔马水电站上面形成一个巨大的水库，它保证充分地调节河流的水量。因而，额尔齐斯河上的水电站不需要火电备用（指备用的火力发电能力——译者）。在高耸的花岗岩的夹壁之间还将建造一条大堤坝，这条堤坝将形成一个辽阔的长达五百公里的水库。斋桑泊的水位因此几乎可以提高十公尺。
    在鄂毕河上靠新西伯利亚城附近，展开了巨大的新西伯利亚水电站的建筑工程。这一水电站对邻近地区的国民经济的电气化将起巨大的作用。新西伯利亚水电站将供应廉价的电力和改善鄂毕河上的航运，这里将形成长二百四十公里和宽约二十多公里的水库。
    塞凡阶梯的最重要一个梯级——亚美尼亚的居穆什水电站已经建成了。
    在第五个五年计划期中，已开始大规模地进行利用安加拉河上的动力资源的工程，以便利用廉价的电力基地和当地的原料来源来发展制铝工业、化学工业、采矿工业和其他各项工业。第一座强大的安加拉水电站的建筑工程正在全速进行。
    在西伯利亚的一些大河流上进行水电站建设，对苏联人民来说具有极大的意义。
    真的，你们翻开苏联地图看一下，从乌拉尔一直到太平洋的整个上部地区就是西伯利亚，这是有无限前途的一片地方。这是一片陆海，它比苏联欧洲部分大两倍，它的地下和地上拥有数不尽的、几乎是原封未动的富源。
    在战后几个五年计划期间，在西伯利亚进行了大规模的工作。苏维埃国家遵照斯大林同志的指示，拟定了大规模的战略计划来征服西伯利亚大自然。庞大的乌拉尔库兹涅茨克联合工厂已建成了。苏联人民依靠这一联合工厂的能力，继续向东挺进。翻过乌拉尔山脉就是西西伯利亚。辽阔的西伯利亚盆地将是未来的世界产小麦和畜牧业的中心，它所出产的小麦和牲畜产品将比现在美国所产的小麦和牲畜产品还要多。在叶尼塞河以东就是东西伯利亚了，这里是一片有着巨大的水力动力资源的地区，它距莫斯科五千公里，距太平洋三千公里。安加拉河、叶尼塞河、勒拿河这些世界上大河蕴有不可估计的力量。这种力量能帮助苏联人民来开发西伯利亚的数不清的富源。
    安加拉河在伟大的改造西伯利亚的工作中将起什么样的作用呢？
    许多年来，安加拉河和滋养它的贝加尔湖一直为我国的科学家和工程师所注意。贝加尔湖是欧亚两洲最大的淡水湖，是世界上最深的一个湖。它长达六百公里，平均宽达六十公里。贝加尔湖是一个巨大的水库，它比波罗的海的水量还要多。注入贝加尔湖的大小河流有三百余条，而以贝加尔湖为发源地的只有一条安加拉河。安加拉河及其支流所能发出的电力要比现在法国、意大利、瑞典、比利时、荷兰、西班牙和丹麦各国所有发电站的电力还要大。
    贝加尔湖可以调节安加拉河的流量，因此，安加拉河上的水电站几乎可以终年满载运行（按指水量常年不变），制造世界上最廉价的电力。在安加拉河上建造水电站要比在其他河上省事而且便宜得多。
    在这里建造一个水电站所需要的土方工程和混凝土工程，要比在其他地方建造同样发电能力的水电站所需要的少好几倍。
    第十九次党代表大会指示，必须在安加拉河地区首先建立起大量耗电的工业。大量廉价的电力将被利用来使工业、运输业和农业电气化。大量的电力将改进城市和集体农庄的居民的生活。此外，由贝加尔湖到北冰洋的连贯的水路将帮助开发西伯利亚的木材资源，西伯利亚是我国主要的森林地区。
    党所领导的苏联人民正在向大自然展开大规模的攻势。这方面已做了很多工作。在辽阔的大陆上新的建筑工程到处兴起了。西伯利亚人怀着极其兴奋的心情，以新的劳动胜利来迎接安加拉河上的工作计划。强力的挖掘机已在河岸上工作了。就是在夜间，在照明灯的照耀下，工作也在不停地进行。由苏联科学院领导的许多苏联科学家都来帮助进行建设。
    第十九次党代表大会关于开始在安加拉河上动工的决定引起了苏联人民的敌人的慌乱。他们曾一再地说，苏维埃政权无法利用安加拉河。现在他们的指望是落空了。安加拉河将为苏联人民服务！
    第十九次党代表大会关于在第五个五年计划期间建成纳瓦水电站和展开考那斯水电站的建筑工程的决定，对波罗的海沿岸的三个苏维埃共和国来说是有特殊意义的。
    在第五个五年计划期间，苏联水力建筑工程的规模和速度与发展我国水力动力的最初几年比较起来显得特别明显。
    发电能力为五万六千瓩的沃尔霍夫水电站建造了八年之久。“电力”电工器材工厂建造沃尔霍夫水电站用的水力发电机曾几乎花去五年的时间，而发电能力远远超过整个沃尔霍夫水电站的齐姆良水电站的三个强力的水力发电机，在一九五一年一年中间就制造成功了，第一台用了两个月零十八天的时间，第二台用了两个月的时间，第三台用了一个月零十八天的时间。
    在沃尔霍夫、斯维尔、第聂伯河等处的苏联水力动力建筑工程中所积累的许多经验，保证了提高我国现代化的水力发电事业的迅速的发展速度和广泛的规模。
    现在，各区的发电站所生产的电力中有百分之十七是由水电站生产的。这就是苏联动力工程的光辉成就。但是，我们水电站还只利用了苏联极丰富的水力资源的一百五十分之一。我国的动力工程面临着利用这些富源这一重大的任务。
    新的水电站将装备这样一些机器，它们能最大限度地减少变河流的动力为电力所必需消耗的劳动力。使水电站完全自动化、提高全部设备的效率，这一切还只是部分地解决合理使用动力资源的重大问题。主要的问题是，水电站的设计工作要能最大限度地加速水电站的建筑和降低对水电站的投资额。
    当一座水电站建成以后，只需要很少的劳动力来使它发电。如果和火力发电站比较，水电站每一瓩时的发电量所需的劳动力要比火力发电站少百分之九十六点六七至百分之九十七点五。这就说明，在动力经济方面利用河流的动力能把劳动生产率提高到什么程度。但是另一方面，用在建筑一座水力发电站上的劳动力要比建造一座火力发电站所用的劳动力要大得多。当然，我们水电站建筑得越快，它的建筑费用就越低；我们越快地使它投入生产和充分地利用它的动力，我们的水力建筑工程的效果就越高。
    还有一项任务就是制造可以使水电站的造价大大降低的新式水力联动机和建筑物的各个部件。正确地组织工作和采用快速工作法等等也都有很大的意义。水电站建设的拖长会大大降低它的经济效率。水电站的迅速建设和它所生产的电力在生产上的迅速使用，对提高劳动生产率来说有极大的国民经济效果。
    这就是为什么在现在以至于在将来都要使水电工作人员共同努力来解决一系列巨大的问题，首先是解决这样一个问题：如何以在各种不同的自然条件下迅速建设堤坝、隧洞、渠道的办法以及采用爆破工作等办法来迅速建设水电站。
    共产党认为，在创造过渡到共产主义社会所必需的丰富产品和消费品的工作中，电气化是有重大意义的。格·马·马林科夫最近在苏联最高苏维埃会议上就这样说：“我们当前最重要的国民经济任务，就是以能够使发电量的增加超过其他经济部门发展的速度和规模，来继续促进电气化。”党所制定的新的大力提高劳动生产率的计划正在实现，我们祖国正在向光辉灿烂的前途迈进，到那时列宁的伟大的遗训——共产主义是苏维埃政权加上全国电气化——就要成为现实了。
