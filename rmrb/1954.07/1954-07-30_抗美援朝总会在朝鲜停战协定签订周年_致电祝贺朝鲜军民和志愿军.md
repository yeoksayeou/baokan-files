Xinhua News Agency, July 29th: The Chinese People's Anti-American and Aid-Korea Association sent a telegram to Marshal Kim Il-sung and the Korean people and army on the anniversary of the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement. The telegram reads as follows: To Marshal Kim Il-sung and the heroic Korean people and the Korean People's Army:

    On the occasion of the first anniversary of the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement, the Chinese People's Anti-American and Aid-Korea Association, on behalf of all the Chinese people, extends warm congratulations and high respect to you, the heroic Korean people, and the Korean People's Army.

    In the past year, the heroic Korean people, under the wise leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and yourself, have completed the preparations for the Three-Year Plan for the restoration and construction of the Korean economy; under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and yourself, the heroic Korean People's Army has gloriously defended the Korean Armistice Line, maintained the Korean armistice, and safeguarded peace in the Far East, enabling the people of China and Korea to engage in the great work of restoration and construction in a peaceful environment. All the Chinese people deeply thank you and the Korean people and the Korean People's Army under your leadership.

    Although the negotiations at the Geneva Conference on the peaceful reunification of Korea failed to reach an agreement due to the stubborn obstruction and sabotage of the US government, we believe that with the unyielding efforts of the people of China and Korea and the promotion and righteous support of the world's great peace forces led by the Soviet Union, the Korean question will eventually be resolved peacefully.

    The Chinese people will continue to deepen the Anti-American and Aid-Korea movement, support the Korean people's work of restoration and construction, maintain the Korean armistice, and, together with the Korean people and all peace-loving people in the world, strive to consolidate peace in Korea, restore negotiations on the Korean issue as soon as possible, and completely peacefully resolve the Korean issue.
