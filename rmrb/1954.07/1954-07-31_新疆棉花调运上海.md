　　Xinjiang Cotton Transferred to Shanghai
　　The Xinjiang Provincial Company of the China National Cotton Yarn & Cloth Corporation has transferred more than 28,000 dan of cotton this year to supply the textile industry in Shanghai and other places. The first batch of more than 25,000 dan of cotton had all arrived at the Daichai Gou Station of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway in early July and has been shipped to Shanghai successively. The fine yarn spun from this batch of cotton can be used to weave high-quality thread fabrics such as poplin and linen.
　　In recent years, cotton planting in Xinjiang Province has developed greatly. In particular, in 1953, the agricultural production troops of the Xinjiang Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army planted more than 26,000 mu of cotton in the Manas River Basin, and all achieved high yields. Now, the cotton produced in Xinjiang Province can not only fully meet the needs of the province's textile industry and the people of all ethnic groups for cotton wool, but also can transfer a portion to supply the inland textile industry.

    新疆棉花调运上海
    中国花纱布公司新疆省公司今年调出二万八千多担棉花，供应上海等地纺织工业。首批棉花二万五千多担，已在七月上旬全部运抵兰新铁路的打柴沟车站，并已陆续运往上海。用这批棉花纺成细纱，能织府绸、麻纱等高级线织品。
    近几年，新疆省植棉事业有很大的发展，特别是一九五三年中国人民解放军新疆军区农业生产部队，在玛纳斯河流域植棉两万六千多亩，都获得了高额产量。现在新疆省所产棉花不仅能充分满足省内纺织工业用棉和各族人民对絮棉的需要，还可抽调一部分供应内地纺织工业。　（新华社）
