Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 1st – In the intense labor of restoring and constructing the steel capital, Anshan, more than 10,000 outstanding steelworkers have gloriously joined the Chinese Communist Party. Standing beside the enormous blast furnaces and open-hearth furnaces, on the rolling mills emitting sparks of molten steel, in the deep iron ore pits, and at numerous basic construction sites, they lead the masses of workers in the struggle to build a strong steel base for our country.

    Among the more than a thousand special-grade labor models, technical innovators, and advanced producers in Anshan, the vast majority are Communist Party members. Among them are the famous technical innovator Zhang Mingshan, the young advanced producer Wang Chonglun, the young female worker and group leader Wu Yulan, who united the entire group to create advanced work methods such as the streamline testing method and rapid repair method, and the model female technician Zhou Rong. Many Communist Party members have made significant contributions to Anshan Iron and Steel’s production and construction. At the No. 8 open-hearth furnace in the steelmaking plant, the famous steelmaking expert and Communist Party member Li Shaokui and other workers produced more than 16,000 tons of steel more than similar open-hearth furnaces last year. In the first five months of this year, they overfulfilled the plan by smelting more than 6,000 tons of steel. In terms of basic construction, there is the model technician Hu Zhaosen, who proposed the use of circulating water pumps, solving a key problem in the construction of the No. 7 blast furnace. Jin Changming, a Communist Party member and foreman of the maintenance section of the Steelmaking Construction Engineering Company, which is responsible for the renovation of steelmaking plants and refractory plants, had already successfully developed three tools in May, increasing work efficiency by two to five times. In June, he and the worker Pi Zhongli successfully developed another tool, increasing work efficiency fivefold. Huang Demao, a Communist Party member at the rebar processing plant of Anshan Iron and Steel’s Affiliated Company, created a rebar forming machine and a rebar assembly line method, increasing work efficiency by two to eight times. Furnace builder Han Qingchen created the double-handed slurry dipping method, and other innovations, which also greatly improved work efficiency.

    After joining the Chinese Communist Party, many outstanding skilled workers have received long-term education and training and have begun to take on leadership roles in some of Anshan Iron and Steel's factories, mines, and workshops. Zhang Lianwen, who was an ordinary tiler before liberation, was promoted to deputy manager of the Industrial Furnace Construction Engineering Company last fall. Jin Zhuling, who worked as a rolling mill worker during the puppet Manchukuo period, was promoted to deputy director of the First Thin Plate Factory and is now able to independently assume administrative leadership of the entire factory. In addition, Xu Chengkuan, deputy director of the Yingtaoyuan Iron Mine, Chen Fengming, deputy director of the Scrap Iron Plant, and Jia Zhenwei and Hou Shen, deputy directors of the Power Plant, were all workers before liberation. After liberation, under the guidance of the Party, they have all played a significant role in the restoration and construction of Anshan Iron and Steel.

    鞍山一万多名优秀工人光荣地加入共产党
   【新华社鞍山一日电】在恢复和建设钢都——鞍山的紧张劳动中，已有一万多个优秀的钢铁工人光荣地参加了中国共产党。他们站在巨大的炼铁炉和平炉旁，在散发着钢铁火花的轧钢机上，在深深的铁矿坑里和许多基本建设的工地上，带领工人群众为建设我国强大的钢铁基地而斗争。
    鞍山市的一千多个特等劳动模范、技术革新者和先进生产者中，绝大部分都是共产党员。这里有著名的技术革新者张明山，年轻的先进生产者王崇伦，团结全组工人创造流水试验法、快速检修法等先进工作法的青年女工、小组长武玉兰和模范的女技术员周鎔等。许多共产党员在鞍钢的生产建设中作了巨大的贡献。在炼钢厂的八号平炉上，著名的炼钢能手共产党员李绍奎和其他工人们，去年比同类型的平炉多为国家生产了一万六千多吨钢，今年头五个月中，他们又超计划地冶炼了六千多吨钢。在基本建设方面，有提出利用循环水泵的建议，解决了七高炉建设的关键问题的模范技术员胡兆森。担负改建炼钢厂和耐火厂等任务的炼钢建筑工程公司检修工区工长共产党员金长明，在五月份已研究成功三种工具，工作效率提高一倍到五倍。六月份，他又和工人皮忠礼研究成功一种工具，提高工作效率五倍。鞍钢附属公司钢筋加工厂共产党员黄德茂创造了钢筋成型机和钢筋流水作业法，提高工作效率二倍到八倍。筑炉工人韩庆臣创造双手蘸浆法等，工作效率也提高很多。
    许多优秀的技术工人在参加中国共产党以后，受到长期教育和培养，开始担负起鞍钢的有些厂矿和车间的领导工作。解放前的张连文是一个普通的瓦工，去年秋天已被提升为工业筑炉工程公司的副经理。伪满时期当轧钢工人的金竹岭，被提升为第一薄板厂的副厂长后，已能独立地担负起全厂的行政领导责任。此外，樱桃园铁矿副矿长许承宽、碎铁厂副厂长陈凤鸣和发电厂副厂长贾振伟、侯深等，在解放前都是工人，解放后，他们在党的教导下，在恢复和建设鞍钢的劳动中，都起了相当大的作用。
