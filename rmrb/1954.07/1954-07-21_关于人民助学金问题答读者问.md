Answers to Readers' Questions Regarding People's Bursaries
Central Higher Education Ministry People's Correspondence Group

Since the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China published the "Decision on Guaranteeing the Completion of the 1954 National Higher Education Enrollment Plan" on May 20, 1954, various parties have been writing to inquire about the conditions for cadres transferred to study at universities to receive People's Bursaries. The answers are as follows:

Conditions for cadres transferred to study and receive People's Bursaries: Any on-the-job cadre who has participated in revolutionary work for more than two years from government agencies, various democratic parties, people's organizations, schools, state-owned factories, mines, enterprises, and military units (including the Chinese People's Volunteers), who has been approved by their original agency or affiliated leading department to apply for the entrance examination, and is admitted, will be eligible for People's Bursary treatment for transferred cadres. Cadres from any department who do not meet the above conditions will receive People's Bursary treatment for general students after enrollment.

    关于人民助学金问题答读者问
    中央高等教育部人民来信组
    自一九五四年五月二十日中共中央“关于保证完成一九五四年全国高等学校招生计划的决定”发表后，各方面纷纷函询高等学校享受调干学生人民助学金的条件，兹特答复如下：
    享受调干学生人民助学金的条件：凡参加革命工作两年以上的政府机关、各民主党派、人民团体、学校、国营厂矿企业及部队（包括中国人民志愿军）的在职干部，经原机关或所属领导部门批准报考，录取入学后，得按调干学生人民助学金待遇。凡不符合上述规定条件的任何部门的干部，入学后一律按一般学生人民助学金待遇。
