Atomic Energy Serves Humanity
——Soviet "Literary Gazette" Answers Readers' Questions
Soviet Doctor of Physics and Mathematics, A. Azirovich

June 27, 1954... Future historians will record that on this day, the world's first industrial atomic energy power station began generating electricity in the Soviet Union. Now it is supplying electricity to industry and agriculture in nearby areas. For the first time, an industrial turbine is driven not by the chemical energy of fuel, nor by the mechanical energy of flowing water, but by the atomic energy liberated by mankind. It is only natural that our country took the first step in applying atomic energy to peaceful industrial purposes.

In the past, mankind gradually mastered the dynamic resources of nature. Mankind forced water and wind, oil and coal to work for itself. In short, mankind forced the sun to work for itself. In power stations and locomotive boiler fireboxes, and in the cylinders of internal combustion engines, the thermal energy of sunlight, stored by plants billions of years ago, was liberated. The sun evaporates moisture from the surface of the ocean, constantly replenishing the hydraulic reserves of rivers. The sun heats the various layers of the atmosphere unevenly, thus generating wind. All ordinary energy on Earth is created by the sun.

Today we see a new type of kinetic energy – atomic nuclear kinetic energy. Although its use is still limited, its future is limitless. Mastering the atomic nucleus can be compared to mastering fire, one of the greatest historical milestones in social development.

Engels wrote: "It (fire) gave man for the first time control over a certain natural force, thereby finally separating mankind from the animal kingdom." The moving myth of Prometheus describes this in poetic form. After man learned to make fire, it became possible to utilize the chemical energy of fuel. However, at this time man could only primitively and directly utilize the heat of the energy. It took tens of thousands of years before this energy could be transformed into mechanical energy to do work. Thus began the era of heat engines, the era of steam engines and internal combustion engines. Even electrical engineering did not directly discover new dynamic resources – we did not find reserves of electricity in nature. However, the mastery of electrical action brilliantly expanded the use of the chemical energy of fuel and the mechanical energy of water and wind: people learned to transmit energy hundreds of kilometers away via electric wires.

Therefore, the entire history of dynamics in the past is a history of how to continuously improve the efficient utilization of chemical and mechanical energy. The events taking place in our time signify a new stage that is essentially different from the past – that is, mankind has begun to harness an incredibly powerful force of nature.

One kilogram of uranium can generate 20 million kilowatt-hours of electricity, equivalent to 2,500 tons of high-quality coal. And making uranium fission is only the first step in mastering nuclear power, because only one-thousandth of the energy stored in the atomic nucleus has been mastered so far. Science has proven that not only uranium, plutonium, and hydrogen contain atomic energy, but all the substances around us contain atomic energy. The reserves of atomic energy are endless. A small pebble on the road contains a large amount of energy, which, if liberated, could replace ten years of work at the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station.

Scientifically and technically mastering nuclear action – this is a brilliant victory of human wisdom. For this, it is necessary to discover the laws governing the activity of the atomic nucleus within a range of one trillionth of a millimeter. It is necessary to learn to control this action and actively promote it. The victorious solution of this task once again proves that the possibility of human understanding is endless, and contrary to the assertions of idealists and agnostics, human wisdom can reach realms that sensory organs cannot directly perceive.

Now we know that the inside of the atomic nucleus is the arena for the struggle of two enormous forces. The atomic nucleus includes positively charged proton particles and neutral neutron particles. The repulsive force between protons tends to split the nucleus. However, the attractive force of the nucleus tightly holds the particles together, keeping the nucleus intact. Uranium is the first type of nuclear fuel for which it is easiest to create a condition that allows the repulsive force to overcome the attractive force of the nucleus. In this way, the nucleus splits open, and the fragments fly off at great speed. In nuclear reactors (uranium piles) where atomic energy is produced industrially, the entire process takes place in a moderator, which is made of graphite and certain other substances.

The particles generated during nuclear fission slow down by passing through the graphite layer, transferring their energy to the moderator, which heats up as a result. The accumulated heat is used to boil hot water or other liquids, turning them into steam and superheating the steam. Then, the steam drives a turbine, which drives a generator. This is how atomic energy is converted into electrical energy and transported to factories, mines, collective farms, and machine tractor stations.

After mastering the powerful force of the atomic nucleus, we can infinitely expand our dynamic resources. In addition to thermal power stations and hydroelectric power stations, atomic power stations are now also in production. The Soviet people read with pride the communiqué of the Soviet Council of Ministers on the commencement of power generation at the Soviet Union's first industrial atomic energy power station with a generating capacity of 5,000 kilowatts. Currently, our scientists and engineers are working on building industrial atomic energy power stations with generating capacities of 50,000 to 100,000 kilowatts.

It is worth pointing out here that an atomic power station with a generating capacity of 100,000 kilowatts only consumes about 200 to 250 grams of uranium per day. A thermal power station with the same generating capacity requires hundreds of tons of coal per day. Compared to the consumption of ordinary fuel, the consumption of this atomic fuel is negligible, so atomic power stations can be built anywhere in our country. This is particularly important for those states far from thermal power resources and hydraulic power resources.

Mastering the kinetic energy of the atomic nucleus not only means an incredibly huge improvement in the power industry, but also a gradual and fundamental change in all technologies. Due to the switch to nuclear fuel, the transportation industry will undergo a revolution. Some tasks that could not be solved by internal combustion engines or jet engines in the past are now realistic and can be solved. An airplane powered by an atomic reactor can make almost unlimited non-stop long-distance flights. Due to the extremely small consumption of nuclear fuel, the prospects for using this fuel in maritime transport, railway transport, and various other modes of transport are limitless.

One day, the vast expanse of the universe will also be a place where humans can move freely. Interplanetary flight has been impossible until recently only due to the lack of a sufficiently efficient source of power. Now nuclear fuel solves this problem. The main difficulty now is that there is no material that can withstand the ultra-high temperatures that occur during nuclear fission. How to solve this difficulty is only a matter of time. Perhaps we will be able to witness the first spaceship flying out of the Earth to other planets…

In the future, after the use of nuclear fuel, it will no longer be necessary to use coal and oil as fuel, as coal and oil are the most valuable and important raw materials in many chemical industrial sectors. A new nuclear chemistry will have broad development; changing the nuclear structure will cause extremely profound changes in all the properties of atoms: it will be possible to transform one element into another, such as nitrogen into oxygen, and mercury into gold. In other words, modern science can even accomplish the element transformation dreamed of by medieval alchemists. This was considered impossible not long ago.

Atoms artificially created in atomic piles are radioactive. As everyone knows, radioactive radiation can sterilize, eliminate malignant tumors, and cause changes in the physiological, chemical, and physical properties of objects. Natural radioactive elements are very rare and expensive. Nuclear reactors can create cheap, man-made radioactive elements in quantities equivalent to hundreds of tons of radium.

Nuclear physics can help medicine eliminate germs in homes, sterilize food, eliminate infectious diseases, and establish effective radiation therapy. Powerful sources of radiation energy, nuclear reactors, can generate and develop new industrial sectors, such as the radioactive technology of metals, plastics, and other materials.

These are other visible development prospects of nuclear physics. In the course of scientific development, these prospects will undoubtedly be broader and more diverse.

…Atomic energy first entered human life not as a great blessing, but as a cruel destructive force. The ruins of two cities and the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people mark its first journey. Even now, on the other side of the ocean, there are still some self-proclaimed scientists in newspapers and magazines calculating the possibility of greater destruction and larger-scale massacres. Others cry out the harm of science, saying that science will bring destruction to mankind. The communiqué issued by the Soviet government on the power generation of the first industrial atomic energy power station proves that in the hands of the Soviet people, atomic energy is not a tool of destruction, but a tool of construction, and it does not carry any special "destructive" nature.

In the Soviet Union, this force of reason and gentleness has been used to serve the cause of building communism. This glorious goal requires the development of productive forces to reach unprecedented levels. Atomic energy can promote the quickest resolution of this task. This new, powerful force can divert rivers, turn places that are now waterless into prosperous regions, thaw places that are covered in ice and snow all year round, and develop the rich resources hidden deep within the earth's crust. Abundant dynamic energy can eliminate arduous physical labor, freeing people to do creative work.

The power generation of the first industrial atomic energy power station is the first reliable guarantee that the huge and almost inexhaustible resources of atomic nuclear power are being used for peaceful purposes to benefit mankind.

    原子能为人类服务
    ——苏联“文学报”答读者问
    苏联物理数学博士　阿吉罗维奇
    一九五四年六月二十七日……未来的历史家将记载，在这一天，世界上第一个原子能工业电力站在苏联开始发电。现在它正在把电力供应给附近地区的工业和农业。工业涡轮机第一次不是用燃料的化学能也不是用流水的机械能，而是用人类所解放出来的原子能来发动。在把原子能用到和平工业用途方面，我国最先走了第一步，这是理所当然的。
    过去，人类逐渐掌握了自然界的动力资源。人类迫使水和风，石油和煤为自己工作。简而言之，人类迫使太阳为自己工作。在电力站和机车的锅炉火室内，在内燃机的汽缸内，亿万年前被植物储藏起来的太阳光的热能被解放出来了。太阳从海洋的表面上蒸发水分，不断恢复河流的水力蕴藏量。太阳不平均地晒热各大气层，因而就产生了风。地球上一切普通的能都是太阳创造的。
    今天我们又看到了一种新的动能——原子核动能。虽然它的使用范围还不大，但它的前途是未可限量的。支配原子核，可以比得上掌握火这样一个社会发展中最伟大的历史纪程碑。
    恩格斯写道：“它（火）第一次给了人以支配一定自然力的权力，由此而使人类最后脱离了动物界。”关于普罗米修斯的动人的神话以诗的形式描述了这一点。人学会了取火以后，就有可能利用燃料的化学能。但是，这时人还只能原始地直接利用能的热量。再过了几万年，才能把这种能改造成机械能，用它来做工作。这样就开始了热力机器的时代，蒸汽机和内燃机的时代。甚至电工学都没有直接发现新的动力资源，——我们没有在自然界找到电力的储量。但是电力作用的掌握出色地扩大了燃料的化学能及水与风的机械能的使用：人们学会了用电线把能输送到几百公里以外的地方去。
    因此，过去动力学的全部历史是一部如何不断改进化学能和机械能的有效使用率的历史。我们这个时代所发生的事件意味着一个和以前有本质上不同的新阶段——即人类开始驾驭一种强大无比的自然力量。
    一公斤铀可以发二千万瓩时电力，相当于二千五百吨优质煤。而使铀分裂还只是掌握核子动力的第一步，因为现在还只掌握了储藏在原子核中的能的千分之一。科学证明，不仅铀、钚和氢含有原子能，我们四周的一切物质都含有原子能。原子能的储量是无穷无尽的。路上随便一块小圆石就含有大量的能，如果把它解放出来，就可以代替第聂伯水电站十年的工作。
    从科学和技术上掌握核子的作用——这是人类智慧的辉煌胜利。为了这，需要发现在一万亿分之一毫米范围内原子核活动的规律。必须学会掌握这作用，积极促进这种作用。这一任务的胜利解决又一次证明，人的认识可能性是无止境的，与唯心论和不可知论者的断言相反，人的智慧是可能到达感觉器官所不能直接感觉的境界的。
    现在我们知道，原子核内部是两种巨大力量的斗争场所。原子核中包括带有阳电荷的质子微粒和中性的中子微粒。质子之间的排斥力有使核子分裂的倾向。但是，核子的吸引力紧紧地吸住微粒，使核子保持完整。铀是第一种最容易给它创造一种条件使排斥力能够战胜核子吸引力的核子燃料。这样核子就分裂开来，形成的碎片以巨大的速度飞散开来。在工业上制造原子能的核子反应堆（铀堆）内，一切的过程都在减速器中进行，这种减速器是石墨和其他某些物质做的。
    核子分裂时产生的微粒通过石墨层就缓慢下来了，将自己的能传给了减速器，因而减速器就发热。积起来的热量就用来烧热水或其他液体，使之化为蒸气，使蒸气过热。接着，蒸气就发动涡轮，带动发电机。原子能就是这样变成电能，被输送给工厂、矿山、集体农庄和机器拖拉机站。
    掌握原子核的强大力量之后，可以无限地扩充我们的动力资源。除去火力发电站和水力发电站外，现在原子电力站也投入生产了。苏联人民怀着骄傲的心情来读苏联部长会议关于苏联第一个发电能力为五千瓩的原子能工业电力站开始发电的公报。现在我国的科学家和工程师正从事建造发电能力为五万至十万瓩的原子能工业电力站。
    这里值得指出的是，发电能力为十万瓩的原子电力站每天只消耗约二百至二百五十公分的铀。而同样发电能力的火力发电站每天需要用数百吨的煤。与普通燃料的消耗比较起来，这种原子燃料的消耗量是微不足道的，这样就可以在我国任何地方建立起原子电力站。这对于那些离开火力发电资源和水力发电资源很远的州来说，是特别重要的。
    掌握原子核的动能，这不仅意味着动力事业有了无比巨大的提高，而且使所有的技术逐渐起本质上的变化。由于改用核子燃料，运输业将要发生一次革命。以前内燃机或是喷气式发动机所不能解决的一些任务，现在都成了现实的事，是可以解决的了。利用原子反应堆发动的飞机可以作几乎无限制的不着陆的远航程飞行。由于核子燃料消耗量非常微小，在海上运输、铁路运输和其他各种运输中使用这种燃料的前途是无可限量的。
    总有一天，宇宙的广大空间也将是人类可以自由活动的场所。星球之间的飞行之所以直至最近还不能实现，只是由于缺乏足够有效的动力来源。现在核子燃料解决了这个问题。现在的困难，主要的是没有一种物质能经得住核子分裂过程中发生的超高温。这一困难如何解决，只是时间问题。也许我们就能亲眼看到第一架飞行星球间的飞船从地球上飞出去……
    将来，使用了核子燃料之后，就可以不再使用煤和石油作燃料，煤和石油都是许多化学工业部门中最宝贵和最重要的原料。新的核子化学将有广泛的发展；把核子结构改变，将使原子的一切性质起极深刻的变化：可以使一种元素变成另外一种元素，例如氮变成氧，水银变成金子。换句话说，现代的科学要连中世纪炼金术士所梦想的元素转化也能办得到了。而在不久以前这还被人认为是不可能的事。
    在原子堆里人工造成的原子是带有放射性的。而放射性的辐射，大家知道，能够杀菌，消灭恶性的肿胀，引起物体生理上、化学上和物理上的性质变化。天然的放射性原素非常稀少，而且很昂贵。核子反应堆能够创造出廉价的、数量相当于数百吨镭的人造放射性元素。
    核子物理学能帮助医学消灭住宅中的病菌，使食品消毒，消灭传染病，建立有效的辐射疗法。强力的辐射能的来源、核子反应堆，能产生和发展新的工业部门，如金属、可塑性材料和其他物质的放射性工艺学。
  核子物理学可见到的其他发展前途就是这样。在科学发展的过程中，这些前途，毫无疑问是会更广阔和更多样性的。
    ……原子能第一次进入到人类生活中来，并不是作为一种伟大的幸福来的，而是作为一种残酷的破坏力来的。两个城市的废墟和十万人的死亡标志着它的第一步行程。就是现在，在大洋的彼岸，也还有一些自封为科学家的人在报刊杂志上算计着更大的破坏，更大规模的集体屠杀的可能。另外一些人则惊叫科学的危害，说什么科学会给人类带来毁灭。苏联政府发表的关于第一个原子能工业电力站发电的公报证明，原子能在苏联人手中，不是毁灭的工具，而是建设性的工具，它不带有任何特别的“破坏”性。
    在苏联，这种理智的温良的力量已被用来为建设共产主义的事业服务。这一光辉灿烂的目的要求生产力的发展达到空前未有的高度水平。原子能就能促使这一任务得到最迅速的解决。这种新的、强大的力量可以使河流改道，使那些现在是无水的地方变成繁荣的地区，能使长年冰天雪地的地方解冻，能开发深藏在地壳内部的富源。丰富的动力能免除费力的体力劳动，使人解放出来做创造性的工作。
    第一个原子能工业电力站的发电，是巨大的、几乎取之不竭的原子核动力的资源被利用在造福人类的和平目的上的第一个可靠保证。
