    Central Institute of Dermatology and Venereology
    Holds Symposium on Prevention and Treatment of Venereal Diseases
    The Central Institute of Dermatology and Venereology held a symposium on the prevention and treatment of venereal diseases from the 7th to the 12th, to study the complete prevention and treatment of venereal diseases, a problem left over from history that endangers the health of ethnic minorities in our country.
    At the symposium, representatives from venereal disease prevention and treatment units in various regions exchanged information on the work and experience of using simple penicillin therapy and other therapies to prevent and treat syphilis in recent years. In the past, considerable achievements had been made in the treatment of venereal diseases in various ethnic minority areas, but the treatment methods were not comprehensive or thorough. After discussion, everyone unanimously agreed that it is necessary to vigorously promote the Soviet method of syphilis eradication in the future. Regions with the conditions should resolutely implement syphilis eradication therapy. Regions without the conditions should find ways to create conditions and implement it as early as possible. The symposium also discussed issues such as treatment targets, post-treatment management, mutual communication, exchange of experiences, development of research work, and training of cadres.
    After the symposium, representatives from various regions who participated in the meeting went to the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region to observe the local implementation of syphilis eradication therapy and experience, in order to promote it. (Xinhua News Agency)

    中央皮肤性病研究所
    举行性病防治座谈会
    中央皮肤性病研究所在七日到十二日举行了性病防治座谈会，研究彻底防治历史上遗留下来的危害我国少数民族健康的性病问题。
    在座谈会上，各地区性病防治单位的代表交流了几年来实行单纯青霉素疗法以及其他疗法防治梅毒的工作情况和经验。过去各少数民族地区在治疗性病方面虽已取得相当成绩，但是治疗方法不全面、不彻底。经过讨论，大家一致认为今后必须努力推行苏联的驱梅疗法。有条件的地区应坚决实行驱梅疗法。没有条件的地区要设法创造条件，提早实行。座谈会对治疗对象、疗后管理、互相联系、交流经验、开展研究工作、培养干部等问题也进行了讨论。
    座谈会结束后，参加会议的各地代表并到内蒙古自治区实地观察当地推行驱梅疗法的情况和经验，以便推广。（新华社）
