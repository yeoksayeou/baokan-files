Eliminate Exploitation and Poverty Through Peaceful Means
Mei Xin

The draft Constitution of our country explains the issue of the ownership of the means of production in the general program section. Article 4 of the general program stipulates that our country will "guarantee the gradual elimination of the system of exploitation and the establishment of a socialist society through socialist industrialization and socialist transformation." This means that the existing four types of ownership in our country will be gradually transformed into a unified socialist ownership.

Before the victory of the New Democratic Revolution in our country, most of the means of production were occupied by imperialists, bureaucratic capitalists, and feudal landlords, becoming tools for them to plunder and exploit the people; national capitalists owned a small portion of the means of production; and the broad masses of working people had little or no means of production. This seriously hindered and damaged social productivity. Coupled with the destruction of war, it led to the extreme deterioration of our country's social economy and the extreme poverty of the people.

After the national liberation, the People's Government confiscated the enterprises of imperialists and bureaucratic bourgeoisie and nationalized them, that is, made them owned by the whole people, completed the great land reform, making land owned by peasants, and at the same time developed cooperative economy and preserved the part of the economy occupied by national bourgeoisie. In this way, the ownership of the means of production in our country has undergone fundamental changes. As written in the draft Constitution: "The ownership of the means of production in the People's Republic of China now has the following types: state ownership, that is, ownership by the whole people; cooperative ownership; ownership by individual laborers; ownership by capitalists." The draft Constitution also states: "The state-owned economy is a socialist economy of ownership by the whole people, and is the leading force in the national economy and the material basis for the state to realize socialist transformation." The economic lifeline is controlled by the state, and the redistribution of the means of production and the change of the ownership of the means of production are important contents of the victory of the New Democratic Revolution in our country, and at the same time an important prerequisite for the transition to socialism.

The change in the ownership of the means of production and the establishment of the leading position of the state-owned economy have opened up broad paths for the development of productivity in our country and ensured the continuous growth of the socialist economy. In 1952, the productivity of industry and agriculture in our country had been restored to the highest level before liberation, thus ending the stage of national economic recovery. In 1953, our country began planned economic construction, which further developed the national economy under the guidance of the unified national economic plan. The socialist economy has achieved prioritized and rapid development. In terms of industry, the total industrial output of our country in 1953 increased by about 2.2 times compared with 1949, and the proportion of modern industry in the total output value of industry and agriculture increased from about 17% to more than 31%; the state-owned industry increased by more than 3.5 times in 1953 compared with 1949, and its proportion in the total industrial output value increased from about 34% to about 53%. If we add the cooperative industry and the joint state-private industry, which account for about 9%, the proportion of the three has reached about 62%; a part of the private industry has been transformed into joint state-private ownership; although the absolute value of private industry has increased, its proportion is gradually declining. In terms of commerce, from 1950 to 1953, domestic and foreign trade expanded every year on the basis of the development of industrial and agricultural production and the increase of social purchasing power. In 1953, the proportion of state-owned and cooperative commerce in the total sales in the domestic market reached about 58%, and the proportion in the total retail sales of commodities in the eight major cities expanded to about 38%. The planned purchase and planned supply of grain implemented in the winter of 1953 ensured the grain needs after the improvement of people's lives. In 1953, although agricultural production in our country encountered more serious natural disasters, grain production still reached more than 330 billion catties, and cotton reached more than 23.4 million dan; the number of peasant households participating in mutual aid and cooperation organizations across the country accounted for about 43% of the total number of peasant households, and the number of agricultural production cooperatives developed to more than 14,000, and now it has developed to more than 95,000; there are 2,340 state-owned farms in the country. In 1953, the state's investment in industrial capital construction increased by more than five times compared with 1950, and the number of major projects that started construction and continued construction in that year reached more than 170. The large-scale industrial capital construction enables our country to approach the great goal of socialist industrialization step by step. The above situation proves that in the past four years, the New Democratic system in our country has ensured the prioritized development and increasing strength of socialist and semi-socialist economy and the economy with socialist characteristics, while protecting the ownership of non-socialist economy and enabling them to have appropriate development within the scope of national policies.

However, we must also see the other side of our country's economy, that is, the backward side, which is manifested in: First, the industrial foundation of our country, especially the heavy industry foundation, is still very weak. When the Soviet Union started its first five-year plan, the proportion of large-scale industry in the total output value of industry and agriculture had reached 54.5%, while our country's heavy industry foundation, industrial manufacturing capacity, or technical level cannot be compared with those of more developed industrial countries. Second, although the state-owned economy has grown rapidly in recent years, the private capitalist economy still accounts for a considerable proportion in our country's economy. In 1953, private industry still accounted for about 38% of the entire industrial economy, and private commerce still accounted for about 42% of the total sales of domestic commodities, and its retail sales accounted for about 62% of the total retail sales in the eight major cities. Third, although the rural mutual aid and cooperation movement has made great progress in recent years, the decentralized small-scale peasant economy still dominates the agricultural economy in our country; and the production tools are very backward, and the cultivated land is also insufficient, and agricultural productivity is very low. These are the backward conditions of our country's economy.

The draft Constitution stipulates the goal of eliminating exploitation and poverty through peaceful means based on the experience of our country since its founding and based on the above-mentioned realistic situation, which is completely correct. In order to achieve this goal, we must adopt an active industrialization policy, actively carry out industrial, especially heavy industrial, capital construction, and transform the existing industries. Chairman Mao pointed out in "On Coalition Government" long ago: "Without industry, there will be no solid national defense, no people's welfare, and no national prosperity." The draft Constitution stipulates that "the state guarantees the priority development of the state-owned economy," and its main content is the state's large-scale industrial capital construction. Similarly, we must carry out socialist transformation of the non-socialist economy. If the capitalist industry and commerce are not subjected to socialist transformation, the productivity of private industry cannot be fully utilized, and the part of the private commerce that can be used is difficult to use well; and due to their exploitative nature, they will develop blindly from the purpose of seeking profit, endangering public interests, disrupting social economic order, and destroying the national economic plan. If we do not organize individual agriculture and handicraft industry and gradually carry out technical transformation on the basis of cooperation, it will be difficult to further improve productivity, to incorporate them into the orbit of the national plan, and even to cause a serious disconnection between agricultural production and large-scale industrial construction.

It can be seen that gradually realizing the country's socialist industrialization and gradually realizing socialist transformation are the basic requirements of our country's transition period, and their purpose is to eliminate the system of exploitation, that is, to gradually change the existing four types of ownership economy in our country into the socialist economy of ownership by the whole people and the socialist collective ownership economy of the working masses, in order to build a socialist society.

The change of the ownership of the means of production, that is, the change of the relations of production, is an extremely huge change and also an extremely sharp and complex struggle. The draft Constitution has made correct provisions on the issue of changing ownership based on the historical situation of our country and proceeding from the current realistic situation, referring to the experience of revolutionary struggles in various countries, and summarizing the experience of revolutionary struggles in our country, especially since the founding of the country. On the one hand, the draft Constitution stipulates that the ownership of the means of production in our country must be changed, the non-socialist economy must be transformed into the socialist economy, and the system of exploitation must be eliminated; on the other hand, the draft Constitution also stipulates that this change of the ownership of the means of production is gradually realized and is realized through peaceful means, which is in line with the specific requirements of our country's economic development. Because our country has state organs led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance, a broad people's democratic united front of various democratic classes, various democratic parties, and various people's organizations led by the Communist Party of China, and an increasingly developed and strong socialist state-owned economy and cooperative economy, it is guaranteed that our country can transform the non-socialist economy through peaceful means, so that the task of changing the ownership of the means of production can be successfully realized.

The draft Constitution not only made appropriate provisions on the policy of changing ownership, but also stipulated the specific methods of changing ownership based on the successful experience of our country since its founding. For the individual agricultural economy, it is through production cooperation, supply and marketing cooperation, and credit cooperation; for the individual handicraft industry and other non-agricultural individual economy, it is through production cooperation and supply and marketing cooperation; the draft Constitution stipulates that the cooperation of this individual economy must be based on the principle of voluntary participation of laborers, and the state will encourage, help, and guide it. For the capitalist industry and commerce, under the policy of utilization, restriction, and transformation stipulated by the state, its ownership will be gradually changed through various forms of state capitalism; the state will also encourage, guide, and provide necessary help for the transformation of capitalist industry and commerce into various forms of state capitalism.

The policies, steps, and specific forms of transforming the non-socialist economy stipulated in the draft Constitution are not only completely suitable for the specific conditions of our country, but also prove to be beneficial to the entire people. According to the actual effect, the yield per unit area of the land cultivated by the vast majority of agricultural production cooperatives is generally 10% to 20% higher than that of mutual aid groups, and 15% to 30% higher than that of individual farmers, which greatly increases the economic income of farmers; with production cooperation, supply and marketing cooperation, and credit cooperation, the possibility of farmers being exploited by capitalists is greatly reduced, and the threat of poverty can be avoided; through cooperation, the degree of consciousness and organization of farmers has also been greatly improved. Similar situations have also emerged after individual handicraftsmen have been organized. Facts have also proved that after many private industrial and mining enterprises have accepted state processing, ordering, especially after implementing joint state-private ownership, the enthusiasm of the vast number of employees has increased, business management has been improved, legitimate profit income has been increased, and difficulties have been overcome. The improvement of industrial and agricultural productivity is the foundation of national prosperity and strength and the happy life of the people.

It must be pointed out here that changing ownership through peaceful means does not mean that there is no struggle. On the contrary, changing ownership will inevitably involve fierce struggles. In order to restrict and gradually eliminate the rich peasant economy, we must rely on the consolidated unity of poor and middle peasants and constantly promote the cooperative movement in agriculture. In order to restrict the negative effects of capitalist industry and commerce that are not conducive to the national economy and the people's livelihood and to prohibit all illegal acts of capitalists, we must constantly strengthen the management of state administration, the leadership of the state-owned economy, and the supervision of the working masses. If not, it will be impossible to guarantee the change of ownership through peaceful means.

Since 1953, our country has implemented planned economic construction. According to the general task of our country's transition period and the basic tasks of the first five-year plan, and according to the specific conditions of our country's social economy, the state will gradually incorporate various economies in our country directly or indirectly into the national plan in order to develop and transform our national economy in a planned way and improve productivity, thereby improving the material and cultural life of the people. With the gradual deepening of socialist transformation, the non-socialist economy will also gradually change its nature and be incorporated into the orbit of the national plan, and the guiding role of the national plan in the national economy will also be gradually strengthened.

When publicizing and organizing the masses to study and discuss the draft Constitution, helping the masses to clearly understand the provisions on the economic system in the draft Constitution can further inspire the masses' high enthusiasm for the cause of socialist industrialization and socialist transformation, promote the vigorous patriotic enthusiasm, and promote the further upsurge of our country's economic construction and socialist transformation, which is an important guarantee that our country can eliminate exploitation and poverty through peaceful means.

    通过和平的道路，消灭剥削和贫困
    梅新
    我国宪法草案在总纲部分说明了我国生产资料所有制的问题。总纲第四条规定我国将“通过社会主义工业化和社会主义改造，保证逐步消灭剥削制度，建立社会主义社会”。这就是说，要把我国现有的四种所有制，逐步地改变为统一的社会主义的所有制。
    我国在新民主主义革命胜利以前，生产资料大部分被帝国主义者、官僚资本家和封建地主所占有，成为他们掠夺和剥削人民的工具；民族资本家占有少部分生产资料；广大劳动人民却没有或只有极少量的生产资料。这就严重地阻碍和破坏了社会生产力，加上战争的破坏，就导致我国社会经济的极度恶化，人民生活的极端贫困。
    全国解放后，人民政府没收了帝国主义和官僚资产阶级的企业归国家所有即全民所有，完成了伟大的土地制度的改革使土地归农民所有，同时发展了合作社经济，保存了民族资产阶级占有的那部分经济。这样，我国生产资料的所有制就发生了根本的变化。正像宪法草案所写的那样：“中华人民共和国的生产资料所有制现在有下列各种：国家所有制，即全民所有制；合作社所有制；个体劳动者所有制；资本家所有制。”宪法草案同时写道：“国营经济是全民所有制的社会主义经济，是国民经济中的领导力量和国家实现社会主义改造的物质基础。”经济命脉为国家所掌握，生产资料的重新分配和生产资料所有制的改变，是我国新民主主义革命胜利的一个重要内容，同时又是过渡到社会主义的一个重要前提。
    生产资料所有制的改变和国营经济领导地位的确立，为我国生产力的发展开辟了广阔的道路，并保证了社会主义经济的不断增长。一九五二年我国工农业生产力已恢复到解放前的最高水平，因此结束了国民经济的恢复阶段。一九五三年我国开始了有计划的经济建设，使国民经济在国家统一的经济计划的指导下有了进一步的发展。社会主义经济得到了优先的较快的发展。就工业说，我国全部工业一九五三年约比一九四九年增长了二点二倍左右，现代工业在工农业总产值中的比重由百分之十七左右上升到百分之三十一以上；国营工业一九五三年比一九四九年约增长了三倍半以上，它在工业总产值中的比重由百分之三十四左右上升到百分之五十三左右，如果加上百分之九左右的合作社工业和公私合营工业，则三者所占比重已达百分之六十二左右；私营工业中有一部分已转变为公私合营；私营工业的绝对值虽有所增加，但其比重是逐渐下降的。就商业说，从一九五○年到一九五三年，国内外贸易在工农业生产发展和社会购买力提高的基础上，每年都有扩大。一九五三年国营和合作社商业在国内市场销售总额中所占比重已达百分之五十八左右，在八大城市的商品零售总额中所占比重已扩大到百分之三十八左右。一九五三年冬实行粮食的计划收购和计划供应，保证了人民生活提高后粮食的需要。一九五三年我国农业生产虽然遇到较严重的自然灾害的侵袭，但粮食生产仍达到三千三百余亿斤，棉花达到二千三百四十余万担；全国参加生产互助合作组织的农户约占全国农户总数的百分之四十三左右，农业生产合作社发展到一万四千多个，目前则已发展到九万五千多个；全国已有国营农场二千三百四十个。一九五三年国家用于工业基本建设的投资比一九五○年增长五倍以上，当年开始施工和继续施工的重大项目达一百七十多个。一九五四年新建和续建的工业建设重大项目将达三百个以上。大规模工业基本建设的进行，就使我国能够一步步接近社会主义工业化的伟大目标。以上情况证明了：过去四年中我国新民主主义制度保证了社会主义和半社会主义经济以及带有社会主义性质的经济的优先发展和日益强大，同时保护了非社会主义经济的所有权并使它们在国家的政策范围内有适当的发展。
    但是，我们还必须看到我国经济的另一方面，即落后的一面，它表现在：第一，我国的工业基础特别是重工业基础仍是很薄弱的。苏联在第一个五年计划开始的时候，大型工业在工农业总产值中的比重已达百分之五十四点五，而我国不论重工业基础、工业制造能力或技术水平都还不能和工业比较发达的国家相比。第二，几年来国营经济虽有了较快的增长，但私人资本主义经济在我国经济中仍占相当大的比重，一九五三年，私营工业在整个工业经济中还占百分之三十八左右，私营商业在国内商品销售总额中还占百分之四十二左右，其零售额在八大城市零售总额中还占百分之六十二左右。第三，几年来农村互助合作运动虽有了很大的发展，但分散的小农经济在我国农业经济中仍占优势；而且生产工具很落后，已经耕种的土地也不足，农业生产力是很低的。这些就是我国经济的落后情况。
    宪法草案根据我国建国以来的经验，并从上述现实情况出发，规定了通过和平的道路，消灭剥削和贫困的目标，是完全正确的。为了实现这个目标，就必须采取积极的工业化政策，积极进行工业特别是重工业的基本建设，并改造旧有工业。毛主席在
  “论联合政府”中早已指出：“没有工业，便没有巩固的国防，便没有人民的福利，便没有国家的富强。”宪法草案中规定“国家保证优先发展国营经济”，其主要内容，也就是国家进行巨大规模的工业基本建设。同样，我们必须对非社会主义经济实行社会主义改造。对资本主义工商业，如果不进行社会主义改造，私营工业的生产力就不能充分发挥出来，私营商业中一部分可以利用的力量也难于很好利用；而且由于它们的剥削性质，它们会从唯利是图的目的出发，盲目发展，危害公共利益，扰乱社会经济秩序，破坏国家经济计划。对个体的农业和手工业，如果我们不把它们组织起来并在合作化的基础上逐步进行技术改造，就难于进一步提高生产力，难于纳入国家计划的轨道，以至农业生产与大规模工业建设之间会发生严重的脱节现象。
    由此可见，逐步实现国家的社会主义工业化和逐步实现社会主义改造，是我国过渡时期的基本要求，其目的就是要消灭剥削制度，也就是要把我国现存的四种所有制的经济，逐步改变为社会主义的全民所有制和社会主义的劳动群众集体所有制的经济，以建成社会主义社会。
    生产资料所有制的改变，即生产关系的改变，是一个极巨大的变革，也是一个极尖锐和复杂的斗争。宪法草案根据我国历史情况并从当前的现实情况出发，参照了各国革命斗争的经验，总结了我国革命斗争特别是建国以来的经验，对改变所有制这一问题，作出了正确的规定。宪法草案中一方面规定了必须改变我国生产资料的所有制，必须把非社会主义经济改造为社会主义经济，必须消灭剥削制度；另一方面，宪法草案又规定了这种生产资料所有制的变革是逐步实现的，是通过和平的道路实现的，这是符合我国发展经济的具体要求的。由于我国有以工人阶级为领导的、以工农联盟为基础的国家机关，有以中国共产党为领导的各民主阶级、各民主党派、各人民团体的广泛的人民民主统一战线，有日益发展和强大的社会主义的国营经济和合作社经济，因此就保证了我国能够通过和平的道路改造非社会主义经济，使改变生产资料所有制的任务能够胜利实现。
    宪法草案不仅在改变所有制的方针问题上作了恰如其分的规定，而且还根据我国建国以来的成功经验，规定了改变所有制的具体方法。对个体农业经济是经过生产合作、供销合作和信用合作，对个体手工业和其他非农业的个体经济是通过生产合作和供销合作；这种个体经济的合作化，宪法草案中规定了必须根据劳动者自愿的原则，国家则予以鼓励、帮助和指导。对资本主义工商业，在国家规定的利用、限制和改造的政策下面，将经过各种形式的国家资本主义逐步改变其所有制；资本主义工商业转变为各种形式的国家资本主义，国家同样予以鼓励、指导和必要的帮助。
    宪法草案规定的对非社会主义经济改造的方针、步骤和具体形式，不仅完全适合于我国的具体情况，而且事实证明是有利于全体人民的。根据实际效果来看，绝大多数农业生产合作社耕种的土地，其单位面积产量一般要比互助组高百分之十至二十，比单干农民要高百分之十五至三十，这样就大大增加了农民的经济收入；有了生产合作、供销合作和信用合作，农民被资本家剥削的可能性就大大减少，就可以免除贫困的威胁；经过合作化，农民的觉悟程度和组织程度也就大为提高。个体手工业者组织起来以后，也出现类似的情形。事实同样证明，许多私营工矿企业在接受国家加工、定货特别是实行公私合营以后，广大职工的劳动积极性就提高一步，改善了经营管理，增加了正当的利润收入，克服了困难。工业和农业生产力的提高，是国家繁荣富强和人民幸福生活的基础。
    这里必须指出：通过和平的道路改变所有制，绝不是说就没有斗争。恰恰相反，改变所有制必然会有剧烈的斗争。为了限制和逐步消灭富农经济，就必须依靠贫农和中农的巩固团结，不断推进农业的合作化运动。为了限制资本主义工商业不利于国计民生的消极作用和禁止资本家一切非法行为，就必须不断加强国家行政的管理、国营经济的领导和工人群众的监督。如果不是这样，就无法保证通过和平的道路改变所有制。
    我国从一九五三年开始，已实行有计划的经济建设，国家根据我国过渡时期的总任务和第一个五年计划的基本任务，并根据我国社会经济的具体情况，将逐步地将我国各种经济直接或间接地纳入国家计划，以便有计划地发展和改造我国国民经济，提高生产力，从而改进人民的物质生活和文化生活的水平。随着社会主义改造的逐步深入，非社会主义经济也就会逐步改变其性质并纳入国家计划的轨道，国家计划对国民经济的指导作用也将逐步加强。
    在向群众宣传和组织群众学习讨论宪法草案时，帮助群众明确认识宪法草案上有关经济制度方面的规定，就可以进一步鼓舞群众对社会主义工业化和社会主义改造事业的高度积极性，发扬蓬勃的爱国主义热情，促进我国经济建设事业和社会主义改造事业的进一步高涨，这就是我国能够通过和平道路，消灭剥削和贫困的一个重要的保证。
