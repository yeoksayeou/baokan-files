Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 18th: TASS Moscow, July 17th—During the Moscow trade negotiations that concluded on July 17, 1954, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and Finnish Foreign Minister Kekkonen also held talks on general issues.
    During the talks, which took place in a friendly atmosphere, broad mutual understanding was found between the two sides, and the following consensus was reached.
    The Soviet government and the Finnish government believe that easing international tensions is the most important task in the current situation. The two governments are convinced that it is currently necessary to work with all countries to safeguard peace and security. Only the collective efforts of all countries—regardless of their social systems—can protect the security of all peoples, because the struggle for peace and against the threat of a new war is in the common interest of all countries. In the spirit of the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance signed on April 6, 1948, and based on their willingness to help safeguard the peace and security of all peoples, the Soviet government and the Finnish government declare their willingness to do everything possible to promote the maintenance of international peace and security in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Organization.
    The Soviet government and the Finnish government strive to consolidate and further strengthen the friendly relations between the two countries, and therefore they have reached an agreement to upgrade the Soviet Legation in Helsinki and the Finnish Legation in Moscow to embassies and to mutually dispatch ambassadors.

    【新华社十八日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十七日讯：在一九五四年七月十七日结束的莫斯科贸易谈判进行的时候，苏联外交部长莫洛托夫与芬兰外交部长吉科宁也进行了关于一般问题的会谈。
    双方在友好气氛中进行的会谈中，发现彼此有着广泛的互相谅解，获得了下列的一致意见。
    苏联政府和芬兰政府认为缓和国际紧张局势是当前局势中最重要的任务。两国政府深信在目前必须与所有的国家一起努力来保卫和平与安全。只有所有国家——不管它们的社会制度如何——的集体努力，才能保卫各国人民的安全，因为争取和平与反对新战争威胁的斗争符合所有国家的共同利益。苏联政府和芬兰政府本着一九四八年四月六日所签订的友好、合作和互助条约的精神，并基于它们愿意有助于保卫各国人民的和平与安全的愿望，宣布它们愿意尽一切可能按照联合国组织的各项原则促进国际和平与安全的维持。
    苏联政府和芬兰政府力求巩固和进一步加强两国之间的友好关系，因此它们已达成协议，把在赫尔辛基的苏联公使馆和在莫斯科的芬兰公使馆升为大使馆，并互派大使。
