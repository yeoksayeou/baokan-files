In China's vast ocean, there are countless rich fishing grounds, and the Yantai fishing ground is one of them. In spring, it abounds in yellow croaker and prawns, and in summer, it produces large quantities of mackerel (chub mackerel), hairtail, and snapper (red sea bream). Currently, the state-owned Yantai Aquatic Products Company is cooperating with the Qingdao, Lushun-Dalian, Liaodong, and Tianjin aquatic products companies, using nearly a hundred fishing vessels and thousands of sailing boats from coastal fishermen to pursue fish schools day and night. The picture shows the No. 94 model fishing vessel of the state-owned Yantai Aquatic Products Company hauling in its nets. In this year's sea market production, this fishing vessel caught 90,000 fish in one net, setting the national record for the highest number of fish caught per net.

The fishing vessels of the state-owned Yantai Aquatic Products Company have caught more fresh fish than in previous years.

Responsible cadres from various state-owned aquatic products companies stationed in Yantai and representatives from the fisheries supply and marketing cooperatives are studying and deciding on the location of the fishing grounds, directing offshore operations.

Before the fishing season, the workers at the Yantai Shipyard worked hard to repair the fishing vessels of the Yantai Aquatic Products Company to ensure timely departure for fishing.

Members of the Jianhua Fisheries Production Cooperative in Dongkou Village excitedly said while visiting the fishing vessels of the state-owned aquatic products company: This boat is so good; we hope to use this kind of boat for fishing in the future.

In order to provide a scientific basis for sea market production, the Institute of Oceanology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the Central Aquatic Products Experimental Institute have established workstations in Yantai. This is the laboratory of the workstation.

The Yantai Canned Food Factory of the Yantai Industrial Company regularly receives various fresh fish supplied by the Yantai Aquatic Products Company, processes and manufactures them, and sells them at home and abroad.

A large amount of fish liver from the state-owned Yantai Aquatic Products Company is supplied to the Qingdao Aquatic Products Company's cod liver oil factory to manufacture cod liver oil and cod liver oil pills, which are sold to various places.

These mackerel (chub mackerel), after processing, are about to be shipped to various places.

New fish schools have been discovered. The No. 94 fishing vessel of the state-owned Yantai Aquatic Products Company, steered by Lü Qibo, is heading towards the area where the fish schools are active.

The millions of pounds of fresh fish produced daily by the Yantai fishing ground are processed, iced, and quickly transported to all parts of the country. This is the fresh fish newly transported to the Dongdan vegetable market in Beijing.

    在捕鱼的季节里
    ——山东省烟台水产公司的海市生产
    在我国辽阔的海洋上，有无数丰饶的渔场，烟台渔场就是其中的一个。这里春天盛产着黄花鱼和对虾，夏天又出产着大批的鲭鱼（鲐鱼）、带鱼和鲷鱼（加吉鱼）等。现在国营烟台水产公司正配合青岛、旅大、辽东、天津等水产公司，用近百艘渔轮和沿海渔民的数千只帆船，在这里日夜追捕鱼群。图为正在收网的国营烟台水产公司的九十四号模范渔轮。该渔轮在今年的海市生产中，一网曾捕过九万条鱼，创全国每网捕鱼数量的最高纪录。
    国营烟台水产公司的渔轮，捕到了比往年更多的鲜鱼。
    各国营水产公司驻烟台的负责干部和渔业供销合作社的代表在研究决定渔场的位置，指挥海上作业。
    在鱼汛前、烟台修船厂的工人就紧张地为烟台水产公司检修渔轮，保证及时出海捕鱼。
    东口村建华渔业生产合作社的社员们，在参观国营水产公司渔轮时兴奋地说：这船多好，将来咱也有希望用这种船捕鱼。
    为了提供海市生产的科学根据，中国科学院海洋生物研究所和中央水产实验所在烟台设立了工作站。这是工作站的化验室。
    烟台市实业公司罐头工厂经常收到烟台水产公司供给的各种鲜鱼，加工制造后运销国内国外。
    国营烟台水产公司的大量鱼肝，供给青岛水产公司鱼肝油厂制造鱼肝油和鱼肝油丸，运销各地。
    这些鲭鱼（鲐鱼）经过加工后即将运往各地。
    新的鱼群被发现了。国营烟台水产公司九十四号渔轮由吕其波掌着舵开向鱼群活动区域里去。
    烟台渔场每天出产的数百万斤鲜鱼，经过加工、冰鲜后迅速运往全国各地。这是新运到北京东单菜市上的鲜鱼。
