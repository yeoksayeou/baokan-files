Jiangsu Province has established 21 county-level agricultural technology extension stations, and another 49 counties are in the process of establishing or preparing to establish agricultural technology extension stations. The province has equipped the agricultural technology extension stations with more than 2,800 agricultural technicians. The established agricultural technology extension stations and animal-powered farm implement stations have dispatched 77 work groups to focus on 77 agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams, using these as a base to gradually establish a technology extension network. When promoting advanced technologies, various regions generally adhere to the principle of "using local materials and promoting locally," proceeding from the specific conditions of the local area, relying on mutual aid and cooperative organizations, and gradually promoting technologies through mass education. The Songjiang County Agricultural Technology Extension Station, taking the Lianmin Agricultural Production Cooperative as its base, carried out a series of rice technology improvements on the cooperative's more than 2,600 mu of land, including appropriate close planting of rice, timely sowing, timely transplanting, and transplanting immediately after uprooting, and conducted continuous demonstrations to promote these techniques throughout the county. Agricultural technology extension stations in ten counties, including Nanhui, have also trained and cultivated more than 1,500 technicians for agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams, laying a good foundation for the establishment of a technology extension network.

    江苏省各县普遍建立农业技术推广站
    江苏省已建立起县农业技术推广站二十一处，还有四十九个县的农业技术推广站正在建立和准备建立中。全省共为农业技术推广站配备了二千八百多名农业技术人员。已经建立的农业技术推广站和畜力农具站派出了七十七个工作组，重点掌握七十七个农业生产合作社和互助组，以此为基点逐步建立技术推广网。各地在推广先进技术时，一般都掌握了“就地取材、就地推广”的原则，从当地具体情况出发，依靠互助合作组织，采用以群众教育群众的方法，逐步推广。松江县农业技术推广站以联民农业生产合作社为基点，在该社二千六百多亩土地上进行了水稻适当密植，适时播种、适时插秧、随拔随插等一系列的水稻技术改进，并进行连环示范，向全县推广。南汇等十个县的农业技术推广站还为农业生产合作社和互助组训练和培养了技术员一千五百多名，为建立技术推广网打下了良好基础。
