The cooperative dining hall of the Xidan District Consumer Cooperative in Beijing is the best-run of the four cooperative dining halls in Beijing. More than 1,200 people eat here every day, and on Sundays and holidays, the number reaches about 2,500 to 3,000. The diners include nearby workers, cadres, student members, soldiers, and construction workers from outside the city.

The dining hall prepares dozens of kinds of stir-fried dishes, braised dishes, and cold dishes every day, as well as various kinds of noodles, and economic meals for 2,400 yuan per serving. The dining hall has a "small shop" that stocks beer, white wine, various fruit wines, and various smoked, roasted, and braised dishes and pickles for drinking; fruits, candies, and cigarettes for members to eat after meals. In summer, it also has soda, popsicles and other cold foods.

People who have eaten in the dining hall say that the dining hall has a wide variety of dishes and rice, the prices are cheap, and it is hygienic, which is more convenient and cheaper than cooking at home. Therefore, on weekends and holidays, many workers and staff members bring their spouses and children to eat.

The dining hall's purchaser, Zhang Jie, goes to the state-owned food companies, retail companies, and cooperative supply stations early every morning to purchase large quantities of chicken, meat, fish, shrimp, and eggs. Fish and shrimp are 18% to 20% cheaper than in the market. Golden needles, fungus, mushrooms, and dried shrimp are purchased in large quantities from the state-owned native produce company, which is about 10% cheaper than the market price. Some vegetables are bought in bulk from the vegetable market, which is much cheaper than buying them retail. Therefore, the price of various dishes in the dining hall is about 20% cheaper than in private restaurants.

The dining hall's cooks have a strict division of labor, close cooperation, and good preparation, so they can make more than 200 dishes and soups in one hour, allowing members to eat delicious dishes in a relatively short time. Dumplings and buns are also pre-made, so those who like pasta can also eat quickly.

The dining hall staff attaches great importance to hygiene. Each person wears a white apron and a white work cap, and always pays attention to the cleanliness of food. The entire dining hall is thoroughly cleaned once a week, and the dining tables are washed with boiling water. All tableware and food utensils are boiled and disinfected every time they are used.

The dining hall staff often listens to the opinions of the members to improve their work. For example, members suggested that they can take their own bowls and chopsticks and serve their own meals, which can save manpower and reduce costs, which is beneficial to the members, and the dining hall has adopted it. The sanitation work has also been gradually improved under the supervision of the members.

    北京市西单区合作食堂办得好
    北京市西单区消费合作社合作食堂，是北京市四个合作食堂中办得最好的一个。这里每天总有一千二百多人进来吃饭，逢到星期日和假日，就有二千五百人到三千人左右。吃客中有附近的工人、干部、学生社员，还有军人和城外的建筑工人等。
    食堂里每天预备着几十种炒菜、炖菜和冷拌菜，有各种面食，还有二千四百元一份的经济份饭。食堂设有“小卖部”，备有啤酒、白酒和各种果子酒，各种下酒食用的熏、烧、卤菜和酱菜；社员饭后吃的水果、糖果和香烟。夏天还备有汽水、冰棍等冷食。
    到食堂吃过饭的人，都说食堂里菜、饭的种类多、价钱便宜、又卫生，比自己在家里做还省事便宜。所以，每逢星期、假日，就有很多工人和职员社员，带着爱人和孩子去吃饭。
    食堂的采购员张杰，每天一大早就到国营食品公司、零售公司和合作社供应站去选购大量的鸡、肉、鱼虾和蛋。鱼虾比在市场上便宜百分之十八到二十。金针、木耳、麻菇、海米是从国营土产公司大量购进的，比市场上的价格便宜百分之十左右。有些菜是从菜市整批买来的，也比零买便宜得多。因此，食堂各种菜的价钱要比上私营饭馆便宜百分之二十左右。
    食堂的厨师分工严密、密切配合、准备工作做得好，这样就能在一小时内做出二百多个菜和汤来，使社员们能在比较短的时间内吃到可口的菜。饺子、饱子也是预先包好的，爱吃面食的也能很快吃到。
    食堂工作人员十分重视卫生，他们每人围上白色围裙、戴上白色工作帽，经常注意食品的清洁。每星期全食堂举行大扫除一次，饭桌都用开水洗刷。饮食用具每用一次都进行煮沸消毒。
    食堂的工作人员，常常听取社员们的意见来改进工作，如社员提出可以自取碗筷、自端饭菜，这样可以节省人力，降低成本，对社员有好处，食堂已经采用。在卫生工作上也在社员的督促下逐步得到改进。
