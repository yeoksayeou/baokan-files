    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 13th: The "Red Star" newspaper published an article by G. Zhukov, in which he cited many facts to illustrate that the United States is turning Japan into a shock force for U.S. aggression in Asia.
    Zhukov said: In Japan, an army was established long ago in violation of the constitution. This army has been strengthened by two laws that came into effect on July 1st, legalizing the revival of Japanese armed forces.
    After discussing Japan's plans to expand its army this year, Zhukov said: The U.S. ruling clique regards Japan as a vassal state, and the leadership and practical training of the revived Japanese army are in the hands of the Pentagon. The Japanese army is full of American advisors and instructors.
    Japan will receive military "aid" worth 100 million U.S. dollars from the United States this year. In fact, the United States spends far more than this on reviving Japanese militarism. The U.S. House of Representatives also decided on June 30th to hand over military equipment worth more than 500 million U.S. dollars to Japan.
    Zhukov, pointing out the U.S. attempt to use Japanese regular troops outside Japan, wrote: While openly restoring the Japanese armed forces, the U.S. ruling clique is stepping up the formation of an aggressive bloc in Southeast Asia. Japan is one of the countries that the United States advocates including in this Asian aggressive bloc.
    Zhukov concluded by pointing out: In Japan and other Asian countries, a broad movement against U.S. war preparations is unfolding.
    The people of Asia have chosen the path of independent and democratic development, and no aggressive trick of imperialism can prevent them from moving towards freedom and independence.

    苏联“红星报”发表格·茹科夫的文章
    评美国加紧复活日本军国主义的阴险目的
    【新华社十四日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科十三日讯：“红星报”登载了格·茹科夫的一篇文章，文章中举出许多事实说明美国正在把日本变成美国侵略亚洲的突击力量。
    茹科夫说：在日本，早就违背宪法建立了一支陆军。这支陆军已被在七月一日开始生效的两项使复活日本武装部队成为合法的法律所加强。
    茹科夫在谈到日本今年扩充军队的计划之后说：美国统治集团把日本当作仆从国家，恢复起来的日本军队的领导权和实际训练都掌握在五角大楼的手里。日本陆军中充斥着美国顾问和教官。
    日本将在今年从美国取得价值一亿美元的军事“援助”。实际上美国用于复活日本军国主义的费用还要比这多得多。美国众议院六月三十日还决定把价值五亿美元以上的军事装备交给日本。
    茹科夫在指出美国企图在日本国外使用日本正规部队时写道：在公开恢复日本武装部队的同时，美国统治集团正加紧在东南亚拼凑一个侵略集团。日本就是美国主张包括在这一亚洲侵略集团之内的国家之一。
    茹科夫最后指出：在日本和亚洲其他国家中正在广泛展开反对美国准备战争的运动。
    亚洲人民已选择了独立和民主发展的道路，帝国主义的任何侵略诡计都不能阻止他们走向自由和独立。
