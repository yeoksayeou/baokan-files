Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, 10th — The city of Nam Dinh and the southern region of Ha Dong province in the Red River Delta are presenting a new atmosphere after liberation.

　　At noon on July 1, when the vanguard of the Vietnamese People's Army, guided by the Kim Star Red Flag, entered Nam Dinh City, the third largest city in North Vietnam, people from all over the city poured onto the main streets to cheer for the liberators of the Vietnamese people - the Vietnamese People's Army: "Long live President Ho Chi Minh!" "Long live the heroic Vietnamese People's Army!" Passionate young men and women paid solemn attention to the national flag. Subsequently, tens of thousands of residents automatically held a victory parade following the army's ranks. The wide streets were filled with an extremely warm atmosphere.

　　In the evening, the shops opened, and the factories resumed work. Children everywhere grabbed the soldiers' hands and sang loudly the song "Long Live Ho Chi Minh" that they had only been able to sing secretly for the past few years.

　　In the southern region of Ha Dong province, on the second day after liberation, people who had been forced to leave their homes under the enemy's ravages returned one after another. In just a few days, thatched huts appeared one after another on the old villages that had become ruins. The fields and gardens, overgrown with weeds for years, are also beginning to regain their original appearance.

    红河三角洲新解放区一片新气象
    【新华社北越十日电】红河三角洲南定城和河东省南部地区在解放后呈现出一片新气象。
    七月一日中午，当越南人民军的先头部队在金星红旗的引导下进入北越第三大城市——南定城的时候，全城人民涌上主要大街，向越南人民的解放者——越南人民军夹道欢呼：“胡志明主席万岁！”“英勇的越南人民军万岁！”热情奔放的青年男女向祖国国旗肃然注目。随后，数万居民跟在军队行列之后自动举行了胜利大游行。宽阔的街道上洋溢着极为热烈的气氛。
    夜晚，商店开门了，工厂复工了。孩子们到处拉着战士们的手，高声唱着他们几年来只能偷偷唱的“胡志明万岁”的歌子。
    河东省南部地区在解放后的第二天，过去在敌军的蹂躏下被迫离乡的人民陆续地回来了。在短短的几天后，一座一座的茅屋在已成废墟的旧村庄上出现了。几年来长满了野草的田园也在开始恢复它原来的面貌。
