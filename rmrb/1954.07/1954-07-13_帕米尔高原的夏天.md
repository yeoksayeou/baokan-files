    Summer on the Pamir Plateau
    By Xinhua News Agency Reporter Wang An
    Traveling west from Uqia County, located at the foot of the Pamir Plateau in western China, and riding horses over countless mountains for three days, one arrives at the grasslands where the Kyrgyz herdsmen graze their livestock in the summer. The grasslands are surrounded by countless towering snow-capped mountains. Every day at noon, the melting snow flows down from the mountains, and thousands of streams surge in the valleys, converging into large rivers. Both the Kashgar River and the Yarkand River originate in the Pamir Plateau. Below the snow-capped mountains are patches of green grassland, with clusters of Kyrgyz herdsmen's tents scattered across the prairie. Herds of horses, cattle, and sheep graze quietly on the grass.
    On the plateau in summer, the weather is changeable, alternating between sunshine and rain. A gust of wind will bring dark clouds from behind the snow-capped mountains, flying close to the grasslands, sometimes bringing a burst of rain, and sometimes even a flurry of snow. In June, the Kyrgyz herdsmen still wear cotton-padded clothes and leather hats. May and June are the seasons for horses and cattle to give birth to foals and calves. Many herdsmen sleep outdoors on the grasslands at night, preparing to assist in the birthing of the young livestock. Atikulong, a model worker in animal husbandry in Xinjiang Province, and his family have not taken off their clothes to sleep for more than half a month. A fire is lit inside the tent, and after the foal is born, it is immediately carried into the warm tent and wrapped in felt to protect it from the cold. This year, Atikulong's 190 head of large and small livestock have added 102 new young animals.
    The reporter has traveled through many pastures and witnessed a bountiful harvest of lambs everywhere. The livestock of every herdsman's tent has increased, and joyful news is spreading across the grasslands. The 162 herdsmen grazing on the Jigeng pasture have added 2,536 new lambs this year, with a survival rate of over 93 percent. The reporter interviewed Mother Kexi, a well-known animal husbandry model who is over 70 years old on the Yuqitash pasture. Before liberation, she had only over 70 sheep, and under the oppression of reactionary rule, her livestock did not develop for decades. Now, she has 436 sheep, large and small. She excitedly said: "The number of livestock on the Yuqitash pasture has more than doubled since liberation, more than the number of people who can run faster than me!" Indeed, it is no longer possible to find herdsmen on the Pamir Plateau who do not own any livestock, as was the case in the past.
    Dairy products are the main food for herdsmen in the summer. This year, every household's tent is filled with sweet milk and yogurt in large basins and small buckets. The herdsmen often eat milk rice porridge and milk noodles. Herdsman Atikulong said: This year, there are more livestock, more milk, and more people wearing new clothes on the grasslands. In twenty days, more than 360 households of herdsmen in the Yuqitash pasture bought more than 5,600 chi (a traditional Chinese unit of length) of printed cloth from the cooperative. Many herdsmen's tents are piled high with newly sewn floral flannel quilts. Before liberation, herdsman Shakulo had no tent or bedding and lived in a stone cave, hugging sheep to sleep when it was cold. Now, his family has a tent, as well as two green flannel quilts and three large cloth quilts. All nine members of his family have put on new clothes.
    Summer is the season when wild animals appear on the Pamir Plateau. Wild goats and wolves and leopards often come and go, harming livestock. On the plateau, one can often see teams of mounted hunters chasing wild animals on the hillsides.

    帕米尔高原的夏天
    新华社记者　王安
    从祖国西部帕米尔高原下的乌恰县城西行，骑马翻过无数大山，走了三天就到了柯尔克兹族牧民夏季放牧的草原。草原四周是无数高耸的雪山，每天中午融消的雪水从山上流下，山谷中暴涨起千万道水流，汇成大河。喀什噶尔河和叶尔羌河都发源在帕米尔高原。雪山下是一片片绿的草原，柯尔克兹族牧民的帐篷一簇簇散布在草原上。成群的马、牛、羊在静静地吃着草。
    高原上的夏天，乍晴乍雨，刮一阵风，乌云就从雪山后涌出，紧贴着草原飞过，有时带来一阵急雨，有时还下一阵雪。六月天，柯尔克兹族牧民还穿着棉衣，戴着皮帽。五、六月是马、牛生驹下犊的季节，夜晚很多牧民露宿在草原上，准备接产幼畜。新疆省畜牧劳动模范阿提库隆一家人半个多月没有脱过衣服睡觉，帐篷内生着火，马驹生下后，立刻抱进温暖的帐篷里用毡包起，不让它受风寒。今年阿提库隆的一百九十头大、小牲畜就新添了一百零二头幼畜。
    记者走过很多草场，处处羊羔丰收，每一顶牧民帐篷的牲畜都增加了，草原上遍传着喜讯。在吉梗草场上放牧的一百六十二户牧民，今年就新添了二千五百三十六只羊羔，成活率达到百分之九十三以上。记者访问了玉旗塔什草场上七十多岁著名的畜牧模范客希老妈妈。解放前，她只有七十多只羊，在反动统治压榨下，几十年来牲畜都没有发展。现在，她已有大、小羊四百三十六只了。她兴奋地说：“玉旗塔什草场上的牲畜比解放时增加了两倍多，比我跑得快的人还多哩！”真的，现在在帕米尔高原上，再也找不出过去那种自己没有牲畜的牧民了。
    奶子是牧民夏天的主要食品，今年家家户户的帐篷里，大盆小桶都满盛着甜奶子、酸奶子。牧民们经常吃着奶子大米稀饭、奶子面条。牧民阿提库隆说：今年草原上牲畜多，奶子多，穿新衣服的人多。玉旗塔什草场三百六十多户牧民二十天中，就向合作社买了五千六百多尺花布。很多牧民的帐篷里都堆起了新缝的花哔叽被褥。牧民沙库洛解放前没有帐篷和被褥，住在石洞里，天冷就抱着羊睡觉。现在，他家有了帐篷，还有两条绿哔叽被子，三条大布被子，全家九口人都穿上了新衣。
    夏天是帕米尔高原上野兽出没的季节，野山羊和狼、豹经常出没，伤害牲畜。在高原上，经常可以看到一队队骑马的猎人在山坡上追逐着野兽。
