The alignment work on the northern section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway main line has been basically completed. Currently, line scheme comparisons and revisions are being made based on the suggestions of the working group of the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government and Soviet experts, while technical design is underway.

The northern section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway starts from Baoji City on the Longhai Railway, passes through the Qinling Mountains southward, and follows the Jialing River valley to Lueyang on the border of Sichuan and Shaanxi, connecting with the southern section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway. The terrain along the route is extremely complex. In order to select a good line, several thousand employees and dozens of drilling rigs were assembled along the route at the end of last year to carry out surveying work. Surveyors climbed Qing Shi Cliff, Pipa Cliff, and Zhai Xiazi and other precipitous cliffs, and traveled back and forth in the rapids of the Jialing River on sheepskin rafts. Sometimes they were tied with hemp ropes and hung beside cliffs tens of feet high to carry out measurements, and they camped on the top of the mountains at night. The employees came up with various ways to overcome difficulties and improve work efficiency. Surveyor Song Shulin and apprentice technician Shi De painstakingly researched and created the "double-sided ditch-crossing turning point method" and the "cross-section intersection method," which increased work efficiency by two to six times, respectively. Soviet experts also spared no effort to go deep into the construction site several times and put forward several suggestions for improving the line. One of the suggestions alone shortened a certain section of the line by eighteen kilometers and reduced the construction of dozens of tunnels. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 宝成铁路北段正线定线工作基本完成

    宝成铁路北段正线定线工作基本完成
    宝成铁路北段正线定线工作已经基本完成，现在根据中央人民政府铁道部工作组和苏联专家的建议作线路方案的比较、改线，同时进行技术设计。
    宝成铁路北段从陇海铁路上的宝鸡市开始，向南穿过秦岭，沿着嘉陵江河谷到川陕边境的略阳，和宝成铁路南段相连接。沿线地形十分复杂。为了选定一条良好的线路，去年年底就有几千职工、几十台钻机集结在沿线进行勘测工作。测量人员翻越青石崖、琵琶崖、窄峡子等悬崖绝壁，坐着羊皮筏子在嘉陵江急流中往来。有时他们腰里缚着麻绳，吊在几十丈高的悬崖旁边进行测量，夜晚就露宿在山顶上。职工们想出种种办法克服困难，提高工作效率。测工宋书林和学习技术员史德苦心钻研，创造出“双面过沟转点法”和“横断面交会法”，分别提高工作效率两倍到六倍。苏联专家也不辞辛劳几次深入工地，提出了好几件改善线路的意见。仅其中的一件建议，就使某段线路缩短了十八公里，减少了几十座隧道的工程。　　　　（新华社）
