    Since the beginning of this year, the People's Literature Publishing House, the Writers Publishing House, the China Youth Publishing House, the New Literature and Art Publishing House, and others have vigorously organized literary creation, and the publication of literary works has begun to increase, with some relatively excellent literary works already available.

    These works reflect revolutionary struggles in history, and also various aspects of real life. Works reflecting the War of Resistance Against Japan include "Fighting on the Hutuo River" and "Railway Guerrilla," works reflecting the Third Domestic Revolutionary War include "Defend Yan'an," "Fighting on the Daqing River North," and "Reconnaissance Across the River," works reflecting the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea include "Steel Transport Soldiers" and "Breakthrough on the Imjin River," works reflecting the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements include "People in the Waves" and "Far From Good Enough," works reflecting the struggle between patriotism and individualism among the working class include "Red Flag," and works reflecting the struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads in rural areas include "People Strive for Higher Positions" and "Cannot Take That Road," and works reflecting the historical revolutionary struggles of ethnic minorities include "Great Miao Mountain Symphony," etc. These works depicting revolutionary struggles and real life have broad and profound educational significance for the people.

    Plays such as "Spring Breeze Blows to the Nomin River," "People Strive for Higher Positions," "Steel Transport Soldiers," and "Red Flag" have been staged in many places and have been welcomed by the broad masses of audiences.

    The authors of these literary creations include older writers, as well as new writers. There are peasant and soldier authors, as well as ethnic minority authors. Li Changsong, the author of "Sprouts Collection," is a poor peasant from Guangdong. "Catching Chicks" and "Embroidered Purse" are both works by soldiers. "Golden Xing'an Mountains" is the work of Punske, a 23-year-old Mongolian youth. Miao Yanxiu, the author of "Great Miao Mountain Symphony," is a member of the Miao ethnic group.

    The People's Literature Publishing House and others will continue to publish literary works successively. The Writers Publishing House will soon publish "Spring Comes to the Yalu River" and "Children on the Banks of the Huai River." The China Youth Publishing House will publish "Regimental Commander," a story depicting the Third Domestic Revolutionary War, "The Everlasting Green Curtain," a story depicting the War of Resistance Against Japan, "Spring on the Mengling River" and "The Growth of an Ordinary Soldier - The Story of Liu Zilin," depicting the relationship between the Chinese People's Liberation Army and ethnic minorities, and so on.
