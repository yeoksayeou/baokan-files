Xinhua News Agency, Buenos Aires, July 14th: According to the Chilean "Siglo" newspaper, the first conference of Latin American legislators and prominent social figures, initiated by a group of Chilean congressmen, was held in Santiago from July 8th to 11th. Participants included legislators and prominent social figures from Chile, Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, Guatemala, Colombia, Nicaragua, Peru, Venezuela, El Salvador, Costa Rica, and other Latin American countries.

    The purpose of the conference was to discuss the current situation in Guatemala and various economic and political problems of Latin American countries. The conference was held under the slogan of opposing U.S. imperialism's interference in the internal affairs of these countries. The participants severely condemned colonial policies, called for the protection of Latin American countries' natural resources and national sovereignty, and defended the right of Latin American countries to conduct free trade with all countries in the world.

    Uruguayan Senator Cusano spoke at the final plenary session, pointing out the various forms of U.S. imperialist infiltration into Latin American countries. He said: "These forms are not only manifested in the political, economic, or diplomatic spheres; one of the main forms of infiltration is also propaganda. Imperialism conducts propaganda through newspapers it controls, through radio stations that serve it, and through films that it virtually monopolizes." He suggested prohibiting such imperialist propaganda activities in Latin American countries. This suggestion was unanimously adopted.

    Argentine representative Professor A. Hardy spoke about the right of Latin American countries to develop their own natural resources with their own strength and funds. He said that the conference should make a decision to prevent monopoly capital from infiltrating these countries. Hardy said that American countries "cannot achieve their independence and liberation until they are freed from imperialist oppression." The Argentine representative's proposal was also adopted by the participants of the conference.

    According to "Siglo", the resolution passed at the meeting specifically pointed out that it is necessary to "reject the resolutions of the Caracas Conference (which the United States forced the participants of the Tenth Pan-American Conference held in Caracas, Venezuela, in March of this year to accept, and legalized U.S. interference in the internal affairs of Latin American countries); affirm the principle of people's autonomy and the inalienable right of each country to choose its own constitutional system; advocate the abolition of the agreement on establishing the Organization of American States; adopt a declaration on any nation's sovereignty over its own natural resources, including nationalization, management, development, and exploitation; advocate free trade between American countries and all countries in the world; reiterate that the mineral resources of American countries belong to the state and that all resources should be exploited by the state with the help of domestic capital; and conduct active struggle to achieve full independence for the colonies on American soil."

    The participants condemned U.S. interference in Guatemala and exposed the faces of the aggressors. They said that they do not recognize the military government of Guatemala as the new government of the country.

    At the end of the conference, a mass rally was held, in which representatives of the Chilean public also participated.

    谴责美国干涉拉丁美洲国家内政
    宣告拉丁美洲人民有权决定本国内部事务
   【新华社十五日讯】据塔斯社布宜诺斯艾利斯十四日讯：据智利“世纪报”消息，由智利国会一批议员发起的第一次拉丁美洲国家立法机关代表和著名社会人士会议于七月八日至十一日在圣地亚哥举行。参加会议的有智利、阿根廷、巴西、巴拉圭、乌拉圭、危地马拉、哥伦比亚、尼加拉瓜、秘鲁、委内瑞拉、萨尔瓦多、哥斯达黎加和其他拉丁美洲国家的议员和著名的社会人士。
    会议的目的是讨论危地马拉目前的局势和拉丁美洲国家的各种经济问题和政治问题，会议是在反对美国帝国主义干涉这些国家的内部事务的口号下进行的。会议的参加者严厉谴责殖民政策，号召保护拉丁美洲国家的天然资源和民族主权，维护拉丁美洲国家与世界各国进行自由贸易的权利。
    乌拉圭参议员库萨诺在最后一次全体会议上发言，指出了美国帝国主义渗入拉丁美洲国家的各种形式。他说：“这些形式不仅表现在政治方面、经济方面或外交方面，渗入的主要形式之一还有宣传。帝国主义通过为他们所控制的报纸，通过为他们服务的电台，通过实际上为他们所垄断的电影来进行宣传。”他建议禁止帝国主义在拉丁美洲国家的这种宣传活动。这个建议获得一致的通过。
    阿根廷代表阿·哈迪教授谈到了拉丁美洲国家用自己的力量和资金来开发本国天然资源的权利问题。他说，会议应当作出决定，要使垄断资本没有可能渗入这些国家。哈迪说美洲国家“在没有摆脱帝国主义压迫以前不可能获得自己的独立和得到解放”。阿根廷代表的建议也为会议的参加者通过。
    据“世纪报”报道，在会上通过的决议特别指出，必须“拒绝加拉加斯会议的决议（这种决议是美国在今年三月在委内瑞拉的加拉加斯举行的第十届泛美会议上强使会议参加者接受的，并使美国对拉丁美洲国家内政的干涉合法化）；确认人民自主的原则和每个国家有自行选择其宪法制度的不可剥夺的权利；主张废除关于规定建立美洲国家组织的协定；通过关于任何民族对自己的天然资源有收归国有、经营开拓和开采的主权的宣言；主张美洲国家和全世界各国之间进行自由贸易；再次声明美洲国家的矿产资源属于国家所有和一切资源都应当由国家借本国资本的帮助进行开采；进行积极斗争，争取美洲土地上的殖民地获得完全的独立。”
    与会者痛斥美国对危地马拉的干涉，并揭露侵略者的面貌。他们说，他们不承认危地马拉的军人政府是这个国家的新政府。
    在会议结束时举行了群众性的大会，智利公众的代表也参加了这次大会。
