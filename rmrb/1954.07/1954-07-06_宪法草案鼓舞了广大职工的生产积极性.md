Xinhua News Agency report: The Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China has greatly inspired the production enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of workers. Many workers are expressing their warm support for the Draft Constitution with new achievements in production. After discussing the Draft Constitution, the workers of Huang Rongchang's carpentry workshop at Chongqing No. 101 Steel Plant overfulfilled their June production plan. The June technical innovation plan has also been realized. The two automatic double band saws installed according to Huang Rongchang's suggestion have been fully installed. This machine replaces the original single carriage circular saw, greatly improving the most laborious process of woodworking and saving three people. Workers at the Chongqing Universal Machinery Factory actively participated in the technical innovation movement to celebrate the promulgation of the Draft Constitution. Advanced producer Yang Huaqing led the entire group to complete three days' worth of work in two days when assembling the No. 5 centrifugal blower. Advanced group leader Li Tengyuan challenged Yang Huaqing and used machines instead of manual operations when assembling the No. 1 blower, increasing work efficiency by 48 times. In addition, many advanced groups in various factories and mines have formulated specific plans to improve production in celebration of the promulgation of the Draft Constitution.

The workers of various factories and mines in Chengdu City are also constantly celebrating the promulgation of the Draft Constitution with new production achievements. When participating in a major overhaul, Peng He'an, an old worker at the Jiaozi Street Power Plant, improved tools and solved a key problem, increasing work efficiency by more than four times and ensuring quality, enabling the overhaul to be completed one day ahead of schedule. When train driver Gao Wancai went on duty the day after the Draft Constitution was promulgated, he went to the dispatching room and asked to exceed the axle load. That day, he hauled more than ten extra carloads of goods than stipulated and arrived at the terminal station on time.

After the promulgation of the Draft Constitution, workers at the Seamless Steel Tube Plant of Anshan Iron and Steel Company further launched a production competition. They proposed to ensure the completion of the July production plan to meet the needs of seamless steel tubes throughout the country. Fan Ruoqun, Deputy Engineer of the Steelmaking Engineering Company, carefully read the Draft Constitution and expressed that he must contribute all his strength to the people without reservation. He said: I studied civil engineering, but during the Kuomintang rule, what I learned was not put to use, and I worked as an accountant for capitalists for eight or nine years. After liberation, I came to Anshan Iron and Steel to participate in large-scale capital construction, and I watched modern factories being built one after another. Today, the Draft Constitution clearly stipulates that we must move towards a more beautiful and happier socialist society. This has given me greater work confidence and strength.

After seeing or hearing the content of the Draft Constitution, many workers at the Yumen Oilfield expressed their support for the Draft Constitution by comparing their lives in the old and new societies, and put forward guarantees for actively completing production plans. The workers of the Second Engineering Team, who are building a wooden bridge, proposed a guarantee to complete the wooden bridge three days ahead of schedule. The oil production workers of the First Oil Production Team of the Oil Production Department proposed a total of six conditions to guarantee increased crude oil production and reduced gas-oil ratio.

    宪法草案鼓舞了广大职工的生产积极性
    据新华社讯：中华人民共和国宪法草案大大鼓舞了广大职工群众的生产积极性和创造性，许多职工都以生产上的新成就表示自己对宪法草案的热烈拥护。重庆市一零一钢铁厂黄荣昌木工房工人讨论了宪法草案后，超额完成了六月份的生产计划。六月份的技术革新计划也已实现。根据黄荣昌的建议安装的两部自动双带锯机，已完全安装好，用这个机器代替原有的单行车圆锯，使木工操作最费力的一道工序大大改善，并且节省三个人力。重庆通用机器厂职工为了庆贺宪法草案的公布，都积极参加技术革新运动。先进生产者杨华清带动全组在装配五号离心式鼓风机时，两天做完了三天的工作。先进小组长李腾辕向杨华清应战，在装配一号鼓风机时，用机器代替手工操作，提高工作效率四十八倍。此外，还有许多厂矿的先进小组，都纷纷为庆贺宪法草案公布而订出具体的提高生产的计划。
    成都市各厂矿职工也不断以新的生产成就来庆贺宪法草案的公布。椒子街发电厂老工人彭和安参加大检修时，改进工具，解决了一个关键问题，提高工作效率四倍多，并保证了质量，使检修工作提前一天完成。火车司机高万财，在宪法草案公布的第二天出乘时，跑到调度室要求超轴，那天他一次就比规定多拉了十多车皮的货，并正点到达终点站。
    鞍山钢铁公司无缝钢管厂职工在宪法草案公布后，进一步开展了生产竞赛，他们提出保证完成七月份生产计划，以满足全国各地对无缝钢管的需要。炼钢工程公司副工程师范若群精心地阅读了宪法草案后，表示一定要把自己的一切力量毫无保留地贡献给人民。他说：我学的是土木工程，但在国民党统治时代却所学非所用，给资本家作了八九年会计。解放后，我到鞍钢参加了大规模的基本建设，眼看着一座座近代化的工厂建设起来了。今天，宪法草案又明确规定我们要走向更美满更幸福的社会主义社会。这给我增加了更大的工作信心和力量。
    玉门油矿的许多工人在看到或听到宪法草案的内容后，都从新旧社会生活的对比中，发表拥护宪法草案的意见，并提出积极完成生产计划的保证。第二工程队正在修筑木桥的工人，提出提早三天修完木桥的保证。采油处第一采油队的采油工人，共提出了六条保证增产原油和降低油气比的条件。
