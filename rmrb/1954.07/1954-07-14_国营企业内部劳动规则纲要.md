Outline of Internal Labor Regulations for State-Owned Enterprises
(Approved by the 215th Government Affairs Council Meeting of the Government Administration Council on May 6, 1954)
Published on July 14, 1954

    In accordance with Article 8 of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, citizens of the People's Republic of China have the obligation to abide by labor discipline. In our country, labor is a glorious, courageous, and noble undertaking, and labor discipline is built on the foundation of the workers' self-awareness. The purpose of formulating internal labor rules in factories and mining enterprises is to ensure and consolidate labor discipline, correctly organize labor, fully and rationally utilize working hours, increase labor productivity, and produce high-quality products. Therefore, strict adherence to internal labor rules is the sacred duty of all workers, engineers, technicians, and staff members of the People's Republic of China.
    
    Chapter I: Recruitment, Transfer, and Dismissal
    
    1.  Applicants for employment must submit to the enterprise administration the appraisal documents from their original work unit regarding their past work performance, or a certificate from the local people's government labor administrative organ; if they are first-time job seekers, they must submit a certificate issued by the government organ of their place of residence, or a certificate issued by the school. No one shall be employed without the above-mentioned certificates.
    
    2.  When hiring or transferring employees to new positions, the enterprise administration must explain to the employees the work system, internal labor rules, safety technical regulations, production hygiene regulations, fire prevention rules, and other rules and regulations that ensure the normal work of employees, and explain how to use machines, machine tools, equipment, and tools.
    
    3.  When hiring employees, the enterprise administration must determine their wage amount according to their technical proficiency, production experience, and the assigned position. Whether the employee's technical proficiency matches the work or position they hold can be determined during the probationary period. The probationary period for workers shall not exceed one month, and the probationary period for staff members shall not exceed three months.
    
    4.  Workers who wish to resign or change jobs must notify the person in charge of their unit two weeks in advance; staff members who wish to resign or change jobs must notify one month in advance. Resignation or job change of employees must be approved by the factory director or manager. Otherwise, it shall be regarded as a violation of labor discipline.
    
    5.  It is forbidden to dismiss employees without reason. When dismissing employees, a certificate should be issued, stating the circumstances and reasons for the dismissal. If an employee disagrees with the enterprise administration's decision to dismiss them, they have the right to appeal to the affiliated trade union organization, or apply to the local people's government labor administrative organ for handling labor disputes.
    
    6.  The appointment and transfer of enterprise leaders shall be decided by the higher-level administrative leading organs according to the system of subordination.

The work card box or access card custody office must also be equipped with an accurate clock.
    
    12. In continuous work, if the replacement shift worker does not arrive, the previous shift worker must not stop working, and should immediately report the situation to the relevant person in charge, who must quickly find someone to take over the work.

In general, punishment should be given within one month from the date of confirming the mistake. If more than three months have passed without punishment being given, punishment should not be given. Unless there are complicated circumstances and justifiable reasons, the person in charge of the enterprise administration should be subject to certain punishment if they fail to handle the matter as scheduled.
    
    19. The purpose of punishing employees is to educate all employees and to educate the punished person.
