Successful Creation of Semi-Mechanized Giant Grain Storage Machine

Han Jinsheng and Wang Qingfu, loaders in Handan City, Hebei Province, and Li Chungeng, a technician at a farm implement factory, have successfully trial-produced a giant grain storage machine for the first time, and the test results are good.

The grain storage machine was created based on the principle of a lift. The machine is 8.14 meters high. The lower part is a chassis with four rubber wheels and a gearbox to drive the operation. Above the chassis are the control levers and the grain hopper. Two circulating lifting cylinders, each 6.43 meters high, stand side-by-side on the hopper. Each cylinder has a circulating wire belt with 40 iron buckets attached to it (each bucket holds 6 *jin* of grain). The grain can be carried from the grain hopper to the lifting cylinder by the iron buckets. In addition, there is a blower device on top of the lifting cylinder to remove impurities and heat from the grain. A 10-horsepower motor or diesel engine can drive the machine.

The grain storage machine is semi-mechanized. Its efficiency depends on the amount of auxiliary labor and the distance of grain supply. At peak efficiency, the lifting cylinder can circulate ten times per minute, and it can store and transport 336,000 *jin* of grain per hour. The average storage and transportation volume per person per hour is 4,608 *jin*, increasing efficiency by 207.2 percent. It also ensures safety and prevents grain from rotting.

After some parts are modified, this machine can be officially put into use. (Attached picture)

    创造半机械化巨型捣囤机成功
    河北省邯郸市装卸工人韩金生、王清福和农具制造厂技师李春耕等，首次试制巨型捣囤机成功，经试验效果良好。
    捣囤机是按照升降机的原理创造成功的。机身高八点一四公尺，下部是底盘和四个胶轮以及带动运转的变速箱；底盘上面是操纵杆和进粮斗，斗上并立着两个高六点四三公尺的循环升降筒，每个筒内有一条循环线带，每条线带上系着四十个铁斗
  （每斗容粮六市斤），粮食可以从进粮斗里被铁斗带到升降筒去。另外，升降筒顶上还有抽风机的设备，用来清除粮食里的杂质和热气。用十马力的电动机或柴油机即可带动机器运转。
    捣囤机是半机械化的。其效能要根据辅助劳动力的多少，供粮距离远近决定，最高效率，升降筒每分钟可循环十次，每小时可捣运粮食三十三万六千斤。每人每小时平均捣运量合四千六百零八斤，提高效率百分之二百零七点二。并能保证安全和防止粮食霉烂。
    这台机器再经过某些部件的改装，就可以正式使用。（附图片）
