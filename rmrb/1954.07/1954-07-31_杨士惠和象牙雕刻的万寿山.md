A Letter from the Moscow River District

Last November, the Beijing Ivory Carving Production Cooperative received a letter from Fei Jiulin·Igori, an eighth-grade student at Moscow School No. 569 in the Moscow River District. The letter stated: "Recently, my friends and I visited the Exhibition of People's China's Industrial and Agricultural Products in Moscow, which made us very happy and satisfied. In particular, I am very interested in the magnificent palace (i.e., Longevity Hill) carved from a single piece of ivory that you exhibited, which I have never seen before. Please tell me how you carved it and how you learned this technique."

The ivory Longevity Hill was a collaborative effort by Yang Shihui, Yang Shizhong, Shi Changhai, and Wang Xilin, members of the Beijing Ivory Carving Production Cooperative. Yang Shihui was the main designer and carver of this work.

	How the Ivory Longevity Hill Was Carved

In the autumn of 1952, the Beijing Special Arts and Crafts Company consulted with Yang Shihui, wanting him to carve a delicate handicraft to take to Moscow for exhibition. Yang Shihui proposed carving a panoramic view of Longevity Hill on a whole piece of ivory. He selected a piece of ivory weighing 65 pounds and devoted himself to the design. Taking the Hall of Dispelling Clouds as the center, he carved ten layers from the jade railings in the center to the Tower of Buddhist Incense, and six layers on each side of the Hall of Dispelling Clouds. In front of the Hall of Dispelling Clouds' archway, groups of happy working people and soldiers are dancing the collective dance to their hearts' content, raising their hands to show their graceful dance postures; in front of the Long Corridor, magnificent peonies are in full bloom; groups of three or five working people sit on the Long Corridor, talking, laughing, and singing; in the quiet jungle and tree-lined paths, countless tourists are confiding and rejoicing. A total of about 400 people are carved on this Longevity Hill. It makes people see at a glance how the liberated Chinese people are happily spending their holidays in this picturesque scenic spot. Whenever Yang Shihui encountered a problem in the design process, he and his brother would go to Longevity Hill to observe. They scrutinized along the Long Corridor, looked down from the back mountain, cruised on Kunming Lake by boat, and even went to the Dragon King Temple to look out, deeply engraving the entire scene of Longevity Hill in their minds. In addition to observing the arrangement and characteristics of palace buildings, they also focused on observing the movements of people in the park and experiencing their thoughts and feelings, studying what techniques to use to carve the magnificent rivers and mountains of the great motherland on this ivory, and to carve out the happy life of the working people. He constantly traveled back and forth on the West Summer Palace Road, circling Longevity Hill countless times. Under the conditions of collective production in the cooperative, he and his comrades jointly researched and discussed, painstakingly carving for more than three months to carve out the outline of the panoramic view of Longevity Hill. Later, he and Yang Shizhong, Shi Changhai, and Wang Xilin carefully studied and brought out the strengths of each person's carving techniques, working in shifts day and night to meticulously carve for three months, before completing this valuable work.

	The Tortuous Path of Learning Carving Techniques

Yang Shihui is forty-three years old this year, and he has been engaged in carving creation for about thirty years. It was a difficult and tortuous process. He grew up in an urban poor family. At the age of fourteen, he went to his great-uncle to learn carpentry and carving techniques, and later learned ivory carving. In the beginning, he imitated stone paintings, flowers, birds, figures, and statues on painting manuals for carving. Later, he asked painters who painted beams and pillars to help him with painting carvings.

At that time, Yang Shihui often thought: why are painters' works so loved and considered works of art, but people don't like their own carved works very much? Once, he raised this question to a fine arts teacher. The fine arts teacher said: Whether you carve figures, flowers, or insects, they are like objects placed on top. Living things are carved into dead things. The things depicted by the painter are drawn after observation and familiarity, and the characteristics are grasped. That's a work of art. If you want to carve well, you have to work hard.

These words deeply moved Yang Shihui's heart, and he was determined to work hard. So, he went to second-hand book stalls in Dong'an Market, Liulichang, and other places to collect famous painting albums and famous painting photos from the Tang, Song, and Yuan dynasties. He studied the figures, landscapes, and brushwork in famous paintings and carved them in the same way. After a period of time, Yang Shihui found that it was very difficult to carve three-dimensional objects according to paintings. He further observed various objective things. In the early morning or evening, he went to the suburbs to observe the morning glow and evening glow, and observe the colors of the villages and crops illuminated by the morning glow and evening glow. He looked at the outlines of palaces, pavilions, mountains, waters, and trees from a distance, and looked at the architecture of palaces and pavilions up close. He not only observed the shapes of various sceneries on a sunny day, but also observed the changes of various sceneries on a windy and rainy day. He studied the villages under the bright spring sun, and also observed the snowy fields. He paid attention to the movements of various figures, and also observed the shapes of various insects, flowers, and plants. All of these served as creative materials for his carving. He was groping alone at that time, and could not get any help.

	Art Gets Attention

After liberation, Yang Shihui participated in special arts and crafts professional conferences and national folk art and crafts exhibitions, which made him realize that ivory carving is a precious heritage of the motherland's art, and at the same time, it was of great help to his creative skills. At the exhibition, he saw "Clay Figure Zhang's" "General Xiang He," Pan Yuchen's stone carvings "Volunteer Army Loves Korean Children" and "Immortal Mother," and Shiwan Liu Chuan's pottery artwork "Du Fu" and "Li Bai." These works were like living beings, with rich expressions, showing the character of various figures, which made him feel that his works were far from meeting the requirements. At the experience exchange meeting, he learned that the reason why these works were so well done was that they were made with the help of local art workers, and many of them had joined art studios. He thought that in the old society, handicraft workers were considered inferior, and painters simply looked down on workers. In the new society, technology is open, and there is help from art workers. He felt unspeakable emotion in his heart. The process of carving a statue of Chairman Mao after his liberation illustrates this point. Since the liberation of Beijing, he had wanted to carve a statue of Chairman Mao. He and his brother collected many photos of Chairman Mao, designed and carved them in this way and that way, and carved several in a row, but they were not like them. Later, he went to ask the famous painter Xu Beihong for advice. Xu Beihong pointed out: "To carve a statue, you must understand the anatomy of the human body, and you must know where the bones and muscles are. To carve it like, you must carve it with thoughts and feelings. Chairman Mao is a great leader respected by everyone. If you want to carve it like, you must carve it into an image that everyone respects and loves." Later, in the process of carving, he repeatedly asked Xu Beihong for advice, and also studied with comrades in the sculpture department. By the autumn of 1952, he had carved a relatively successful statue of Chairman Mao. This fully illustrates the role of artists in helping him with his carving techniques.

Yang Shihui has personally carved no less than hundreds of works of art. However, in the past, these products were exclusively for export merchants to sell to the reactionary rulers of capitalist countries for appreciation. The workers, in addition to being subjected to layers of exploitation, could not get any help and did not know how to improve their skills at all. In the short few years after liberation, with the support of the People's Government, most of the handicraft workers have been organized. With everyone's joint efforts, they have created a valuable work—the ivory Longevity Hill. It is not only loved by the people of the whole country, but also deeply praised internationally. All this clearly tells us: art must serve the people, and only the broad masses of working people know the precious and valuable works. (Attached picture)

    杨士惠和象牙雕刻的万寿山
    沈文英
    莫斯科河区的来信
    去年十一月间，北京市雕刻象牙生产合作社接到从莫斯科市莫斯科河区寄来的一封信，写信的是莫斯科五六九学校的八年级学生费九林·伊哥里。信上说：“最近，我和朋友们参观了在莫斯科展出的人民中国工农业产品展览会，这使我们感到高兴和满意。特别是我对你们展览的用一颗象牙雕刻成的堂皇的宫殿（即万寿山）很感兴趣，这是我从没见到过的。请告诉我你们是怎样把它雕刻成的，是怎样学会这种技术的。”
    象牙万寿山是由北京市雕刻象牙生产合作社的社员杨士惠、杨士忠、石常海和王锡林等合作的，杨士惠是这件作品的主要设计者和雕刻者。
      象牙万寿山是怎样雕刻成的
    一九五二年秋天，北京市特种工艺公司和杨士惠商量，要他刻一件精致的工艺品拿到莫斯科去展览。杨士惠提出在一整颗象牙上刻上万寿山的全景。他挑选了一颗重达六十五斤的象牙，就在这上面专心设计。他以排云殿为中心，从正中的玉石栏杆到佛香阁就刻了十层，排云殿的两边都刻了六层。在排云殿的牌坊前，一群群幸福的劳动人民和军人，正在尽情地跳着集体舞，他们举起双手，表现出健美的舞姿；在长廊的前面，瑰丽的牡丹花正怒放着；长廊上坐着三、五成群的劳动人民，在谈笑、歌唱；在悠静的丛林中和林荫道上，有无数的游人在谈心、欢乐。这个万寿山上一共刻上了约四百多人。使人们一看就知道解放了的中国人民，是如何幸福地在此景色如画的名胜中欢度假日。杨士惠在设计过程中一有问题，就和他弟弟一道到万寿山去观察。他们循着长廊端详，爬上后山俯视，划着船在昆明湖上游览，甚至到龙王庙去了望，把万寿山的全部景象，深深地记在脑里。他们除了观察宫殿建筑物的安排和特点外，还着重观察游园人的一举一动和体会他的思想感情，研究用什么手法在这颗象牙上雕刻出伟大祖国的锦绣河山，雕刻出劳动人民幸福的生活。他就是这样不断地往返于西颐公路上，在万寿山中兜了无数次圈子，在合作社集体生产的条件下，再和同志们共同研究商量，苦心雕凿了三个多月，雕出了万寿山全景的轮廓。后来，他又和杨士忠、石常海、王锡林细心研究，发挥了每个人雕刻技术的特长，昼夜轮班精雕细刻三个月，才完成了这件有价值的作品。
      学习雕刻技术的曲折道路
    杨士惠今年四十三岁，他从事雕刻创作三十年左右。是经过了一段艰苦曲折的过程的。他生长在一个城市贫民家里，十四岁就到叔祖父处学木匠和雕刻技术，后来又学了雕刻象牙。开始，他仿石画、仿画谱上的花鸟人物、神像等雕刻。后来他又请描画栋梁的画匠帮他画画雕刻。
    当时杨士惠常想：为什么画家的作品那样受人喜爱，被认为艺术品。自己刻出来的作品，人们却不大喜爱呢？一次，他把这个问题向一位美术教员提出，那位美术教员说：你们刻出来的不论是人物、花卉、昆虫，就像是摆在上面的。有生命的东西都被刻成死的了。画家所描绘的事物，是他观察和熟悉后，抓住了特征才下笔的，这才是艺术品。你要雕刻得好，要下苦功夫。
    这段话深深地打动了杨士惠的心，他决心下功夫。于是，他就去东安市场、琉璃厂等旧书摊上收集些唐、宋、元朝的名画画册和名画照片。研究名画里的人物、山水和笔法来照样雕刻。过了一个时期，杨士惠发现照画片来雕刻成立体的东西，是有很多困难的。他就进一步观察各种客观事物。清早或傍晚，他去城郊观察早霞、晚霞，观察在早霞、晚霞照映下的村庄、庄稼的色彩。他远望宫殿、楼台、山水、树林的轮廓，近看宫殿、楼台的建筑。他不但观察晴朗天各种景物的形态，并且观察风雨天各种景物的变化。他研究春光明媚下的村庄，还观察冰天雪地的田野。他注意各种人物的动作，也观察各种昆虫、花草的形态，这些，都作为他雕刻时创作的资料。他那时就是这样独自摸索，得不到任何帮助。
      艺术得到了重视
    解放后，杨士惠曾参加了特种工艺品专业会议和全国民间美术工艺品展览会等会议，使他认识到象牙雕刻是祖国艺术的宝贵遗产，同时对他的创作技术上也有很大的帮助。在展览会上，他看到“泥人张”作的“将相和”，潘雨辰的石刻“志愿军热爱朝鲜儿童”、“不朽的母亲”，石湾刘传的陶器艺术品
  “杜甫”“李白”，这些作品都像活的一样，有着丰富的表情，表现出各种人物的性格，使他感到自己作品还远不合乎要求。在经验交流会上，他知道这些作品所以做得这样好，是在当地美术工作者的帮助下才做得出来的，其中有许多人已经参加美术工作室工作。他想到在旧社会里，手工业工人被认为低人一头，画家根本就瞧不起工人。在新社会里，技术公开，还有美术工作者的帮助，心里说不出的感动。从他解放后雕刻毛主席塑像的过程，就说明了这个问题。从北京解放那年起，他就想雕个毛主席像。和他弟弟收集了好多毛主席的相片，这样设计，那样雕刻，一连刻了好几个，但是刻不像样。后来，他就去请教名画家徐悲鸿，徐悲鸿指出：
  “雕刻塑像，要懂得人体的解剖，要知道骨骼、肌肉在那里。要刻得像，还要刻得有思想感情。毛主席是人人尊敬的伟大领袖，你要刻得像，就要刻成
  一个人人尊敬、热爱的形象。”后来他在雕刻过程中，又几次三番去请教徐悲鸿，还和雕塑系的同志共同研究，到一九五二年秋，才算刻成了一个比较成功的毛主席像。这充分说明美术家的帮助，对他雕刻技术上所起的作用。
    杨士惠亲手雕刻的艺术品不下数百件，但是，过去这些产品，是专供出口商人卖给资本主义国家的反动统治者欣赏的，劳动者除了受到层层的剥削外，得不到任何的帮助，根本不知道怎样改进技术。在解放后短短的几年内，在人民政府的扶持下，手工业工人已经大部组织起来，在大家共同努力下，创造出有价值的作品——象牙万寿山，它不但得到全国人民的喜爱，而且深受国际上的好评。这一切，清楚地告诉我们：艺术必须服务于人民，也只有广大的劳动人民，才知道珍贵有价值的作品。（附图片）
