The All-China Women's Federation
Instructions on Current Rural Women's Work

(I) In the past year, the nation's rural areas have vigorously publicized the general task of the state during the transition period, implemented the unified purchase and sale of grain, vigorously developed agricultural production cooperatives, and comprehensively launched the movement to gradually realize the socialist transformation of agriculture. In this movement, the democratic women's federations at all levels, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, coordinated with relevant departments, implemented the principle of mobilizing both men and women, went deep into the countryside, and carried out women's work. As a result, the socialist consciousness of rural women has risen significantly, the number of women participating in rural production mutual aid and cooperative organizations has increased significantly, the labor efficiency and production technology of women have gradually improved, and rural women have become a major force for the country to realize the socialist transformation of agriculture and develop rural production. At the same time, in the movements to publicize and implement the Marriage Law, the general election, and various routine tasks, the state's policies of equality between men and women, freedom of marriage, and protection of the rights and interests of women and children have been publicized and implemented, further promoting rural women's participation in various construction undertakings and social activities such as politics, economy, culture, and health; thereby improving the political and cultural level of rural women to varying degrees, and a number of new families with democracy, harmony, unity, and production have emerged. Many women leading cadres and women labor models who love the motherland, love socialism, actively engage in labor production, and have prestige among the masses have emerged, further improving the social and family status of rural women.
    However, because the capitalist ideology is still continuing to breed in some male and female farmers, and the feudal remnant ideology of valuing men over women still widely exists; the democratic women's federations at all levels are not yet sound enough, the political and professional levels of cadres are uneven, and the work is not deep enough or wide enough. In some places, the women's federations are not good at closely cooperating and working with relevant departments; therefore, there are still many shortcomings and difficulties in the work. We must face this situation squarely and actively strive to change it in order to further carry out rural women's work.
    (II) During the state's transition period, the fundamental task of rural women's work is to further educate and organize the broad masses of rural women to resolutely implement the general task of the state during the transition period, gradually realize the socialist transformation of agriculture, and continuously develop agricultural productive forces, so that the development of agricultural production is adapted to the development of the state's socialist industry; and on this basis, strive to gradually realize the complete liberation of rural women. Accordingly, the most central task of current rural women's work is to further educate and organize the broad masses of rural women to enthusiastically support and actively participate in the large-scale production movement centered on mutual assistance and cooperation, that is:
    First, it is necessary to continue to educate rural women, strive to improve socialist consciousness, enthusiastically support and actively support various measures for agricultural cooperativization, organize them to participate in mutual aid groups, agricultural production cooperatives, supply and marketing cooperatives, credit cooperatives, and other mutual assistance and cooperative organizations, resolutely take the socialist road, overcome capitalist ideas, and fight against capitalist spontaneous forces.
    Second, it is necessary to continue to educate rural women to recognize the important significance of developing diversified rural production centered on agriculture, firmly establish the idea that labor is glorious, actively participate in all rural production that needs and can be participated in, and work together with male farmers to continuously improve the yield per unit area, develop rural production, and provide more grain, cotton, oil, and other cash crops needed for socialist industrialization, so as to ensure the completion and over fulfillment of the state's construction plans.
    Third, on the basis of developing rural production, it is necessary to improve the material and cultural life of rural women and children, improve women's cultural and scientific knowledge, regularly publicize and implement the Marriage Law, carry out maternal and child health and mutual aid childcare work, gradually solve the special difficulties of women participating in the rural production mutual assistance and cooperation movement, continue to eliminate feudal remnant ideas and customs that discriminate against and restrict women, and further enable women to enjoy equal rights with men in all aspects of political, economic, cultural, social, and family life.
    (III) In order for democratic women's federations at all levels to correctly implement the above tasks, they must, under the unified leadership of the local Party committee, correctly implement a series of class policies of "relying on poor peasants, consolidating the unity of middle peasants, gradually developing mutual assistance and cooperation, and gradually restricting the exploitation of rich peasants until the final elimination of the exploitation of rich peasants." According to the specific plan for the large-scale production movement centered on the development of mutual assistance and cooperation in the local area, closely cooperate with the relevant departments of the People's Government and people's organizations, conscientiously educate and organize rural women to participate in the rural production that is needed at that time and in that place and that women can participate in; and implement the policy of equality between men and women in all rural work, explaining the great benefits of realizing the common labor of men and women to the country, the family, and male and female farmers, and enlightening the broad masses of male farmers to consciously support and support women's participation in social production.
    In order to concretely implement the above tasks, the democratic women's federations at all levels should suggest and assist the leading organs and mutual assistance and cooperation organizations of the local rural work to promote the following eight tasks:
    First, it is necessary to regularly and repeatedly educate them on the general task of the state during the transition period, and take this as the center to carry out education on mutual assistance and cooperation, development of production, worker-peasant alliance, labor glory, and women's liberation, enlightening them to love the motherland and love socialism, and making them understand that only by resolutely implementing the general task of the state during the transition period, gradually implementing the socialist transformation of agriculture, and developing rural production can all farmers become rich together, and rural women can be completely liberated. It is also necessary to educate rural women so that they understand that a happy and fulfilling life is created by actively and consciously working. Women must actively work, participate in labor competitions, abide by labor discipline, give play to the spirit of collectivism, cherish public property, strengthen internal unity of groups and societies, find ways to increase production, develop rural production, and actively strive to support the country's industrialization. Young women should pay special attention to educating them to love labor, be content with rural production, actively participate in mutual assistance and cooperative organizations, and strive to improve culture and technology, so that they can become an active force in the cause of agricultural socialist transformation.
    In view of the fact that mobilizing the broad masses of rural women to take the road of mutual assistance and cooperation is a long-term, arduous and complex task, and at present, a considerable number of women in individual households still account for a considerable proportion in the country, so they must be repeatedly, deeply and meticulously persuaded and educated, and at the same time, typical demonstration methods should be used to enable them to experience the superiority of mutual assistance and cooperation from living facts, and gradually improve socialist consciousness, so as to consciously and voluntarily participate in mutual assistance and cooperative organizations and resolutely take the socialist road; They should not only not be discriminated against and attacked, but also their enthusiasm for production must be correctly brought into play, and they should be educated and helped to arrange housework and promoted to learn advanced farming methods in order to improve production efficiency and develop production.
    Second, it is necessary to adhere to the principle put forward by the Party Central Committee in the "Resolution on Developing Agricultural Production Cooperatives" that "men and women labor forces should implement the same remuneration according to the quality and quantity of work (for example: in the same type of work, if women do as much and as good work as men, the remuneration they receive must be equal to that of men, and the remuneration should also exceed that of men if they work more than men; if the labor is not as good as men or only reaches half of that of men, the remuneration should also be reduced accordingly)." According to the experience of various places, this principle can be implemented in both mutual aid groups and agricultural production cooperatives, but the degree of implementation is gradually improved with the improvement of the idea of equality between men and women among male and female farmers and the gradual improvement of the system of recording work points and accounting in mutual assistance and cooperative organizations. Therefore, it is necessary to consciously conduct ideological education on equality between men and women for male and female farmers, and help groups and societies improve and improve the system of recording work points and accounting; at the same time, it is also necessary to educate women to work hard and make achievements, which is the basic condition for realizing equal pay for equal work between men and women. At the same time, attention should also be paid to the special physiological conditions of women, appropriately take care of women's health, and prevent the phenomenon of continuing to compare physical strength between men and women.
    Third, it is necessary to implement the division of labor and industry between men and women in various rural productions, and rationally use women's labor force. To this end, according to the specific plan for the entire development of production and mutual assistance and cooperation in the local area at that time, and the specific requirements for the allocation of male and female labor force, determine the specific projects and plans for mobilizing women to participate in rural production, and do not call for and arrange them in a one-size-fits-all manner. Generally speaking, in areas where there is a shortage of labor, the cultivation is rough, the land potential is still large, and there are cash crops, women should be vigorously mobilized and organized to participate in agricultural and other production labor in a planned manner. Even if they do not have the habit of production labor, they should gradually change their habits and guide women to engage in production labor. In areas with a large labor force, they should consult with relevant agencies and gradually open up new production avenues according to the actual situation, such as developing orchards, animal husbandry, fisheries, various handicrafts, etc., so that women's potential labor force can be rationally arranged from agriculture or other production labor. Therefore, it is necessary to arrange and develop women's production avenues according to the time and place. All production that requires women to participate in and is suitable for women's technology, physical strength, and living conditions should be assigned to women. Raising livestock and poultry is an important agricultural labor, which can increase fertilizer sources and increase the supply of meat and eggs, and is the most suitable production for women, so women should be strongly encouraged to participate.
    With the development of agricultural technology reform, women should be vigorously encouraged to strive to learn the advanced technology needed for local rural production development and which women's physical strength can handle, and gradually overcome conservative ideas. The learning method mainly relies on learning while doing, men teaching women, and mutual teaching and mutual learning; and it can be recommended that the government absorb a certain number of women to participate in learning in technology promotion stations and technology training courses.
    Fourth, among the women activists in agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid groups, and grassroots women's congresses, women who actively work, have progressive political ideas, can connect with the masses, and have a certain working ability should be selected, and they should be trained in a planned manner to become the leading backbone of mutual aid groups, cooperative grassroots women's congresses, and attention should be paid to training women labor models. It should be suggested to the local Party and government leading organs that excellent women cadres should be consciously trained and promoted to participate in various leading positions in the Party, government and its subordinate units, and a certain number of women should be absorbed to participate in learning in mutual assistance and cooperation training courses and cadre training courses. For women leading cadres and women labor models who have already emerged, we must regularly understand their situation, publicize their advanced ideas, summarize and promote their advanced experience, and constantly improve their socialist consciousness, leadership ability, and production technology, and educate them: strive to guard against arrogance and complacency, study hard, and move forward step by step. Due to the tradition of valuing men over women for thousands of years, the growth and development of women backbones and women labor models have many difficulties. The leadership must take care to love and cultivate them, do not let them hold too many concurrent jobs, take care of their physical health, and encourage and support them to overcome difficulties and move forward continuously.
    Fifth, housework labor must be appropriately and appropriately arranged in a planned manner so that more women's labor force can be invested in rural production. At present, most of the labor engaged in by rural women in the family is agricultural labor and agricultural auxiliary labor. Such as threshing and drying grain, raising livestock, raising pigs for manure accumulation, etc., are all indispensable labor in agricultural production. As for sewing, weaving, cooking, washing clothes, cleaning sanitation, etc., it is also necessary labor to serve agricultural producers and ensure their clothing and food. These labor engaged in the family is still an important responsibility of women and cannot be underestimated. The broad masses of rural women must be made aware that participating in rural production is glorious and important, and it is also necessary to shoulder housework labor. What is now in front of rural women is: on the one hand, due to the development of mutual assistance and cooperation and diversified rural economy, there is an increasing demand for women to invest in rural production; on the other hand, the responsibility of housework labor still needs to be borne on the shoulders of women. Therefore, how to plan and appropriately arrange housework labor, so that the broad masses of women are not excessively prevented from participating in rural production due to housework, this is an important topic in current rural women's work. The current effective ways to solve the problem are:
    First, according to the agricultural season, use the slack season and rainy days to prepare the clothes, shoes and socks for the whole family, so that women can concentrate more on agricultural labor during the busy season. In general daily housework, reasonable division of labor between family members should be implemented, and stronger female labor force should be drawn out to engage in agricultural labor. Second, with the development and possibility of the agricultural mutual assistance and cooperation movement, mutual assistance and cooperation methods can be appropriately adopted to handle certain housework labor. In the past, some individual places overemphasized that women should bear housework labor and gave up or relaxed the leadership of women's participation in agricultural production, which was wrong. However, it must also be recognized that it is equally wrong to simply emphasize that women should go to the fields regardless of women's heavy housework labor, and both should be corrected.
    Sixth, the difficulty that mothers in rural areas have no one to take care of their children when they participate in production must be appropriately resolved. There are currently four forms for solving this problem: (1) During the busy farming season, relatives and neighbors help each other and individual custody; (2) Mutual aid groups for childcare during the busy farming season; (3) Nurseries during the busy farming season; (4) Year-round day nurseries in rural areas. These four forms of childcare are feasible and appropriate as long as they are based on the needs of production, suitable for the possible conditions at that time and in that place, and adhere to the principle of voluntary participation of male and female farmers and implement the principle of mutual benefit between nannies and mothers. In the current general mutual aid groups and agricultural production cooperatives, it is appropriate to generally advocate the first and second forms. In agricultural production cooperatives where women regularly participate in production, and have a certain number of leading backbones and material conditions, nurseries during the busy farming season can be tried out in key areas and steadily promoted. Rural year-round day nurseries, at present, some individual places, due to production needs, and the masses are willing to hold them, can accumulate experience, but it is not appropriate to advocate and promote them. Generally speaking, we should not pursue advanced forms and run large-scale nurseries at present; however, it is also wrong to ignore the need and possibility of running childcare mutual aid undertakings, ignore the active role that this work plays in the development of production, and therefore let it go.
    Seventh, women should be taken care of for the difficulties that occur during the production process due to pregnancy, childbirth, menstruation, illness, etc.; however, the principle of care should be based on the local production development situation and possible conditions at that time, and when the cooperative and mutual aid groups allocate labor hours, they should assign them to do labor that does not harm their health as much as possible during women's pregnancy, and they should be given appropriate rest during the production period. As for material care, it cannot be generally advocated at present, and only a number of difficult households can be appropriately taken care of in various ways according to the possible conditions at that time and in that place. In order to improve the health of women and children, it should be combined with the development of the agricultural mutual assistance and cooperation movement, focusing on continuing to publicize common sense of maternal and child health, common sense of childcare, and criticizing superstitious and backward ideas to male and female farmers, so that they understand general knowledge of prevention and nursing and reduce diseases. And continue to cooperate with local health departments to carry out maternal and child health work, train new obstetricians in a planned manner, transform and educate old obstetricians, so that they know ordinary disinfection and new methods of midwifery knowledge, in order to promote new methods of midwifery.
    Eighth, in order to further increase the enthusiasm of male and female farmers for production, promote unity among the people, and consolidate agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups, the Marriage Law should be regularly publicized and implemented in conjunction with socialist ideological education for all male and female farmers. In general areas, in winter schools, civil schools, rural activists and backbone training courses, the Marriage Law should be included as one of the compulsory courses, and it should be explained in light of the ideological situation of the masses and in combination with local specific issues, in order to establish correct marriage views and marriage system. The Marriage Law should be continuously and universally publicized to the broad masses of male and female farmers; in particular, model couples and model families should be appropriately commended and rewarded to set an example among the masses. In daily life, propaganda and explanation should be carried out in combination with the inspection and summary of production, focusing on specific marriage and family problems that occurred at that time and in that place. It can also be suggested that relevant departments appropriately combine the propaganda and inspection of the implementation of the Marriage Law when carrying out marriage registration work, mediation work, and people's reception work. It is recommended that the People's Court conduct public trials within an appropriate scope when sentencing serious and educational marriage cases in order to maintain the seriousness of the law and discipline, and to conduct legal and disciplinary education for the masses. In the work of transforming backward townships in various places, it should be recommended that the local Party and government departments appropriately combine the work of publicizing the Marriage Law and inspecting the implementation of the Marriage Law.
    (IV) In order to complete the above tasks well, democratic women's federations at all levels should strengthen their leadership over rural women's work, care about the suffering of the masses of rural women and their special difficulties in educating and organizing rural women to participate in the large-scale production movement centered on mutual assistance and cooperation, safeguard the legitimate rights of women, and appropriately promote the welfare of women and children. To this end, the rural mutual assistance and cooperation organization should be taken as the most important position for carrying out women's work, and the representatives of the rural women's congress and its leading organization - the women's congress committee - should take the women representatives in the agricultural mutual assistance and cooperation organization as the backbone, and absorb a certain number of women representatives from individual households to participate, relying on the women members and group members to unite and promote women from individual households to participate in rural production and mutual assistance and cooperation organizations and carry out other women's work.
    Women cadres must strive to improve the ideological and policy level of Marxism-Leninism, firmly establish the idea of serving the people and the masses of women, guard against arrogance and impetuosity, learn with humility, and conscientiously and responsibly do women's work. We must regularly and correctly use the weapon of criticism and self-criticism to improve our work, enhance unity among women cadres, enhance the unity of the broad masses of working women and all women, and enhance the unity of male and female masses to ensure the implementation of the general task of the state during the transition period. Cadres engaged in rural women's work at democratic women's federations at all levels, especially democratic women's federations and women's work cadres at the levels of special district, county, district, and township, must truly delve into the agricultural production mutual assistance and cooperation movement, conscientiously study the various policies issued by the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party on developing agricultural production and the mutual assistance and cooperation movement, and learn the methods of specifically helping male and female farmers run a mutual aid group and an agricultural production cooperative, and learn to specifically help rural women solve their difficulties in participating in rural production and mutual assistance and cooperation organizations, and should study knowledge and technology related to rural production, in order to truly delve into the rural production and mutual assistance and cooperation movement.
    Finally, in terms of leadership, democratic women's federations at all levels must deeply recognize that the key to strengthening women's work and completing the above tasks is to make their organizations closely rely on the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and conscientiously and correctly implement the various policies issued by the Party and the government to the masses of women; and in various central tasks, regularly and conscientiously implement the principle of mobilizing both men and women, relying on the Party committee to uniformly arrange, inspect, and summarize women's work, and the democratic women's federations must actively reflect the demands of the masses of women and the situation and problems of women's work to the Party committee, report the experience of women's work, and put forward suggestions for carrying out women's work and selecting women cadres, and carry out work according to the instructions of the Party committee. In carrying out various tasks, they must abide by the laws of the People's Government, follow the guidance of the People's Government, and also closely cooperate with people's organizations and other relevant departments, relying on all male and female cadres in the countryside to complete it together.
    In terms of work methods and work style, democratic women's federations at all levels must continue to go deep into reality, select key points of various types, investigate and study, accumulate experience, cultivate typical examples, and set up banners; at the same time, pay attention to taking care of overall work, combining points and areas, and do not relax the leadership of overall work due to delving into key points, but also be good at summarizing and promoting advanced experience, using the experience of advanced areas to drive the work of general areas and transform backward areas, and gradually promote rural women's work in various types of areas, so that it can advance in accordance with the national development of rural production and the gradual realization of the socialist transformation of agriculture.

    中华全国民主妇女联合会
    关于当前农村妇女工作的指示
    （一）最近一年来，在全国各地农村中，大张旗鼓地宣传了国家过渡时期的总任务，实施了粮食统购统销，大力发展了农业生产合作社，全面开展了对农业逐步实现社会主义改造的运动；在运动中，民主妇联的各级组织，在中国共产党领导之下，配合了有关各部门，贯彻了男女一齐发动的方针，深入农村，开展了妇女工作，因而农村妇女的社会主义觉悟显著上升，参加农村生产互助合作组织的人数大量增加，妇女的劳动效率和生产技术逐步提高，农村妇女已经成为国家对农业实现社会主义改造、发展农村生产的重大的力量。同时在宣传贯彻婚姻法运动、普选运动及各项经常工作中，又宣传了贯彻国家的男女平等、婚姻自由和保护妇女、儿童权益的政策，进一步推动了农村妇女参加政治、经济、文化、卫生等各项建设事业和社会活动；从而不同程度地提高了农村妇女的政治、文化水平，出现了一批民主和睦团结生产的新家庭，涌现了不少热爱祖国、热爱社会主义、积极劳动生产和在群众中有威望的妇女领导骨干及妇女劳动模范，进一步提高了农村妇女的社会和家庭的地位。
    但是，由于在某些男女农民中，资本主义思想还在继续滋生，重男轻女的封建残余思想还普遍存在；民主妇联的各级组织，还不够健全，干部的政治、业务水平不齐，工作还做得不够深入、不够广泛，有些地方妇联还不善于和有关部门密切配合，协同工作；因此工作中的缺点、困难还很多，必须正视这种情况，积极努力改变这种情况，以求进一步开展农村妇女工作。
      （二）在国家过渡时期，农村妇女工作的根本任务，是要更进一步教育和组织广大农村妇女，坚决贯彻国家过渡时期的总任务，逐步实现对农业的社会主义改造，不断地发展农业生产力，使农业生产的发展与国家的社会主义工业的发展相适应；并在这基础上争取逐步实现农村妇女的彻底解放。据此，当前农村妇女工作的最中心的任务则是更进
  一步教育和组织广大农村妇女热烈拥护和踊跃参加以互助合作为中心的大生产运动，这就是：
    第一、必须继续教育农村妇女，努力提高社会主义觉悟，热烈拥护并积极支持农业合作化的各项措施，组织她们参加互助组、农业生产合作社、供销合作社、信用合作社及其他互助合作组织，坚决走社会主义道路，克服资本主义思想，与资本主义自发势力作斗争。
    第二、必须继续教育农村妇女认识发展以农业为中心的农村多种生产的重要意义，巩固地树立劳动光荣思想，积极参加需要与可能参加的各项农村生产，与男农民一起共同为不断地提高单位面积产量，发展农村生产，更多地供给社会主义工业化所需要的粮食、棉花、油料及其他经济作物，以保证完成和超额完成国家的建设计划而奋斗。
    第三、必须在发展农村生产的基础上，改善农村妇女和儿童的物质文化生活，提高妇女群众文化科学知识，经常宣传贯彻婚姻法，开展妇婴卫生与互助托儿工作，逐步解决妇女参加农村生产互助合作运动的特殊困难，继续清除歧视和束缚妇女的封建残余思想和风俗习惯，更进一步使妇女在政治的、经济的、文化的、社会的和家庭的生活各方面与男子享有平等的权利。
      （三）各级民主妇联要正确贯彻上项任务，必须在当地党委统一领导下，正确贯彻“依靠贫农，巩固地团结中农，逐步地发展互助合作，逐步地限制富农剥削直到最后消灭富农剥削”的一系列的阶级政策。根据当地发展互助合作为中心的大生产运动的具体计划，与人民政府的有关部门和人民团体密切配合，认真地教育和组织农村妇女参加当时当
  地需要的又是妇女可能参加的农村生产；并在农村各项工作中贯彻男女平等政策，说明实现男女共同劳动，对国家、对家庭、对男女农民都有重大好处的道理，启发广大男农民自觉地赞助和支持妇女参加社会生产。
    为着具体贯彻执行上项任务，各级民主妇联应建议并协助当地农村工作的领导机构和互助合作组织，推进以下八项工作：
    第一、必须经常地反复地向她们进行国家过渡时期的总任务的教育，并以此为中心，进行互助合作、发展生产、工农联盟、劳动光荣和妇女解放的教育，启发她们热爱祖国、热爱社会主义，使她们了解只有坚决贯彻实现国家过渡时期的总任务，逐步实行对农业的社会主义改造，发展农村生产，全体农民才能共同富裕，农村妇女才能彻底解放。还要教育农村妇女，使她们了解幸福美满的生活是依靠积极地自觉地劳动创造出来的，妇女必须积极劳动，参加劳动竞赛，遵守劳动纪律，发挥集体主义精神，爱护公共财产，加强组、社内部团结，寻找增产窍门，发展农村生产，为支援国家工业化而积极努力。对青年妇女应特别注意教育她们热爱劳动，安心农村生产，积极参加互助合作组织，努力提高文化、技术，使自己成为农业社会主义改造事业中的积极力量。
    鉴于发动广大农村妇女走互助合作的道路，是长期的艰苦复杂的工作，目前在全国范围内单干户的妇女还占相当大的数量，所以对她们必须反复地深入细致地进行说服教育工作，同时用典型示范的方法，使她们从活的事实中体验到互助合作的优越性，逐步提高社会主义觉悟，从而自觉自愿地参加互助合作组织，坚决走社会主义道路；对她们不但不能歧视和打击，而且必须正确地发挥她们的生产积极性，教育和帮助她们安排家务，推动她们学习先进耕作方法，以提高生产效率，发展生产。
    第二、要坚持贯彻党中央“关于发展农业生产合作社的决议”中提出的“男女劳动力应该按照工作的质量和数量，实行同样的报酬（例如：在同一工种中，妇女如果和男人做同样多和同样好的工，她所得的报酬必须是和男人相等的，劳动超过男人的，报酬也照样超过；劳动比不上男人或只达到男人一半的，报酬也照样减少）”的原则。根据各地的经验，此项原则在互助组和农业生产合作社中均能贯彻实现，但贯彻实现的程度，是随着男女农民的男女平等思想的提高和互助合作组织中记工算账制度的逐步健全而逐步提高的。故必须经常地有意识地对男女农民进行男女平等的思想教育，并帮助组、社健全和改进记工算账的制度；同时还必须教育妇女努力劳动，做出成绩，这是实现男女同工同酬的基本条件。与此同时，还应注意妇女生理上的特殊情况，适当照顾妇女的健康，防止继续发生男女硬比体力的现象。
    第三、必须在农村各项生产中，实行男女分工分业，合理使用妇女劳动力。为此应根据当时当地整个发展生产和互助合作的具体计划，对于男女劳动力调配的具体要求，确定发动妇女参加农村生产的具体项目和计划，不能千篇一律地号召布置。一般来说，在劳动力缺乏耕作粗糙和土地潜力还大以及经济作物的地区，应大力发动和组织妇女有计划地参加农业和其他生产劳动，即使没有生产劳动习惯，也应逐步改变习惯，引导妇女走上生产劳动。在劳动力多的地区，应与有关机关商量，根据实际情况，逐步开辟新的生产门路，如发展果林、畜牧、渔业、各种手工业等，这样就可使妇女的潜在劳力，从农业或其他生产劳动中得到合理的安排。因此，必须因时因地来安排和开拓妇女的生产门路，凡属需要妇女参加而又是适合妇女技术、体力和生活条件的生产，应分配给妇女做。饲养家畜家禽，是重要的农业劳动，既可增加肥源，又可增加肉食、蛋品的供应，而且是最适合妇女的生产，故应大力提倡妇女参加。
    随着农业技术改革的发展，应大力提倡妇女努力学习当地发展农村生产所需要的而又是妇女体力所能胜任的先进技术，逐步克服保守思想。学习方法，主要依靠边做边学，男教女学，互教互学；并可建议政府在技术推广站及技术训练班中，吸收一定数量的妇女参加学习。
    第四、应在农业生产合作社、互助组及基层妇女代表会议的妇女积极分子中，选择积极劳动、政治思想进步、能联系群众，而又有一定工作能力的妇女，有计划地培养她们成为互助组、合作社基层妇女代表会议的领导骨干，并注意培养妇女劳动模范。应向当地党、政领导机关建议，有意识地培养和提拔优秀的妇女干部参加到党、政及其所属的各种领导岗位上去，在互助合作训练班和干部训练班中，应吸收一定数量的妇女参加学习。对于已经涌现出来的妇女领导骨干和女劳动模范，要经常了解她们的情况，宣传她们的先进思想，总结和推广她们的先进经验，并要不断提高她们的社会主义觉悟、领导能力、生产技术，教育她们：力戒骄傲自大，努力学习，步步前进。由于几千年重男轻女的传统，妇女骨干和妇女劳动模范的成长和发展，是有很多困难的，领导上必须加意爱护和培养，不要让她们兼职太多，照顾她们的身体健康，并要鼓励和支持她们克服困难，不断前进。
    第五、必须有计划地适当地安排家务劳动，使更多的妇女劳动力投入农村生产。目前农村妇女，在家庭中从事的劳动，其中绝大部分本身就是农业劳动和农业辅助劳动。如打场晒谷、饲养牲口、养猪积肥等等，都是农业生产中不可缺少的劳动，至于缝纫、纺织、煮饭、洗衣、打扫卫生等等劳动，也是为农业生产者服务，保证他们衣、食的必要劳动。这些在家庭中从事的劳动，仍是妇女重要的职责，不可轻视。必须使广大农村妇女认识参加农村生产是光荣的重要的，担负起家务劳动也是很必要的。现在摆在农村妇女面前的情况是：一方面由于互助合作和农村多种经济的发展，日益增多地要求妇女投入农村生产；另一方面家务劳动的责任，还仍须担任在妇女的肩上，因此如何有计划地适当地安排家务劳动，使广大妇女不因家务而过大的妨碍参加农村生产，这就是当前农村妇女工作中的一个重要的课题。目前行之有效的解决问题的办法是：
  一、按照农业季节，利用农闲及天雨时，准备好全家的衣服鞋袜，使农忙季节妇女集中较多力量，从事农业劳动。一般日常家务，应实行家庭成员之间的合理分工，抽出较强的女劳动力，从事农业劳动。二、随着农业互助合作运动的发展和可能，可适当采用互助合作的办法，处理某些家务劳动。过去个别地方，曾过分强调妇女应担负家务劳动，放弃或放松领导妇女参加农业生产，是不对的。但也必须认识，不顾妇女沉重的家务劳动单纯强调妇女下地的做法，也同样是不对的，均应纠正。
    第六、必须适当解决农村中母亲们在参加生产时孩子无人照管的困难，对解决此问题目前已有四种形式：（1）农忙季节，亲邻相帮，个别寄托；
  （2）农忙托儿互助小组；（3）农忙托儿所；
  （4）农村常年的日间托儿所。这四种托儿形式，只要是根据生产的需要，适合当时当地的可能条件，掌握了男女农民自愿的原则并贯彻了保姆与母亲之间互利的原则，都是可行的、适宜的。在目前
  一般的互助组、农业生产合作社中，以普遍提倡第 一、二种形式为宜。在有妇女经常参加生产的农业生产合作社中，又具备了一定的领导骨干及物质条件时，可以重点试办、稳步推进农忙托儿所。农村常年的日间托儿所，目前有个别地方，因生产需要，群众愿意，已经举办者，可以积累经验，但不宜提倡推广。一般来说，目前不应追求高级形式，举办大规模的托儿所；但忽视举办托儿互助事业的需要与可能，忽视这一工作对发展生产所起的积极作用，因而放任自流，也是不对的。
    第七、妇女在生产过程中，因怀孕、生育、月经、疾病等而发生的困难，应予照顾；但照顾的原则，应从当时当地生产发展情况与可能条件出发，在合作社、互助组分配活计时，在妇女孕期应尽可能分配她们做不损害健康的劳动，产期应给与适当的休息。至于物质照顾，目前尚不能一般提倡，只能根据当时当地可能条件，用多种多样办法，适当照顾若干困难户。为了增进妇女和儿童的健康，应与发展农业互助合作运动相结合，着重向男女农民，继续宣传妇婴卫生常识、育儿常识、批判迷信落后的思想，使她们懂得一般预防护理知识，减少疾病。并继续配合当地卫生部门开展妇婴卫生工作，有计划地训练新接生人员，改造和教育旧接生人员，使她们知道普通消毒和新法接生知识，以推广新法接生。
    第八、为着更加增进男女农民的生产积极性，促进人民内部团结，巩固农业生产合作社和互助组，对全体男女农民，均应结合社会主义的思想教育，经常宣传贯彻婚姻法。在一般地区，冬学、民校、乡村积极分子及骨干训练班中，均应将婚姻法作为必修课程之一，针对群众的思想情况，结合当地具体问题，进行讲解，以求树立正确的婚姻观点，和婚姻制度。应对广大男女农民不断地普遍地宣传婚姻法；尤应适当表扬、奖励模范夫妇、模范家庭，在群众中树立榜样。日常则应结合检查、总结生产，针对当时当地发生的具体的婚姻和家庭问题，进行宣传解释。并可建议有关部门在进行婚姻登记工作、调解工作及人民接待工作时，适当地结合宣传和检查婚姻法的执行情况。建议人民法院在判处严重而又有教育意义的婚姻案件时，可以在适当范围内进行公审，以严肃法纪，并可对群众进行法纪教育。在各地改造落后乡的工作中，应建议当地党、政有关部门，适当结合宣传婚姻法及检查婚姻法执行情况的工作。
      （四）为了很好地完成上述任务，各级民主妇联均应加强对农村妇女工作的领导，在教育和组织农村妇女参加以互助合作为中心的大生产运动中，应关怀农村妇女群众的生活疾苦和特殊困难，维护妇女的合法权利，适当地推进妇女儿童的福利事业。为此应以农村互助合作组织为自己进行妇女工作的最重要的阵地，乡村妇女代表会议的代表及其领导组织——妇女代表会议委员会，均应以农业互助合作组织中的妇女代表为骨干，并吸收一定数量的单干户的妇女代表参加，依靠女社员、女组员团结和推动单干户的妇女参加农村生产和互助合作组织并开展其他各项妇女工作。
    妇女工作干部必须努力提高马克思列宁主义的思想水平和政策水平，巩固地树立为人民、为妇女群众服务的思想，戒骄戒躁，虚心学习，认真负责做好妇女工作。要经常地正确地运用批评与自我批评的武器，改进工作，增进妇女干部之间的团结，增进广大劳动妇女及全体妇女的团结，增进男女群众的团结，以保证国家过渡时期总任务的贯彻实现。各级民主妇联从事农村妇女工作的干部，尤其是专区、县、区、乡各级的民主妇联及妇女工作干部，必须真正钻到农业生产互助合作运动中去，认真学习中国共产党中央委员会发布的关于发展农业生产、互助合作运动的各项政策，学会具体帮助男女农民办好一个互助组、一个农业生产合作社的办法，学会具体帮助农村妇女解决其参加农村生产、互助合作组织中的困难问题，并应学习有关农村生产的知识和技术，以便真正深入到农村生产、互助合作运动中去。
    最后，各级民主妇联在领导上，必须深刻的认识：要加强妇女工作，完成上述任务，其关键是在使自己的组织紧紧依靠中国共产党的领导，认真地、正确地将党和政府发布的各项政策贯彻到妇女群众中去；并在各项中心工作中，经常地认真地贯彻男女一齐发动的方针，依靠党委统一布置、检查、总结妇女工作，民主妇联要主动地向党委反映妇女群众的要求及妇女工作的情况和问题，报告妇女工作的经验，提出开展妇女工作、选拔妇女干部的建议，根据党委的指示进行工作。在进行各项工作中，均必须遵守人民政府的法令，遵循人民政府的指导，还要和人民团体及其他有关部门密切配合，依靠在农村的全体男女干部，共同完成。
    在工作方法和工作作风上，各级民主妇联必须要继续深入实际，选择各种不同类型的重点，调查研究，积累经验，培养典型，树立旗帜；同时要注意照顾全面工作，使点面结合，不要因深入重点而放松全面工作的领导，还要善于总结和推广先进经验，以先进地区的经验，带动一般地区、改造落后地区的工作，逐步推进各种不同类型地区的农村妇女工作，使之与国家发展农村生产和逐步实现农业社会主义改造事业相应前进。
