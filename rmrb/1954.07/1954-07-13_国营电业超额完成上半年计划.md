State-Owned Electricity Industry Exceeds First Half of Year Plan

[This Newspaper's Dispatch] The national state-owned electricity industry exceeded the state power generation plan for the first half of the year by 4%. Compared with the same period last year, it increased by 22.3%, with the Northwest region increasing the most, reaching 85%. The Northeast and North China regions also increased by about one-quarter.

During the first half of this year, the various economic and technical indicators of electricity production were also completed well. The line loss rate was reduced by 10% compared to the plan, and the coal consumption rate was reduced by 0.3% compared to the plan. Due to the reduction in coal consumption, the country saved 6,700 tons of standard coal. This has a certain effect on reducing power generation costs.

Since the All-China Federation of Trade Unions issued the decision on launching a technical innovation movement nationwide, many electricity companies have further intensified the technical innovation movement on the existing basis, and many valuable technical improvements have emerged. For example, Wang Kaishan, a labor model from the Taiyuan No. 2 Power Plant, and others collectively researched and implemented six major innovations, such as an automatic boiler water level indicator, in May. Cao Xunquan, a veteran worker from the Xiangzhong No. 3 Power Plant, and technician Zeng Zifu cooperated to solve the major critical problem of the failure of the overspeed governor caused by the wear of the safety ring, which had long threatened the safe operation of a certain turbine.

There have also been many gains in safe power generation and supply in the first half of this year. Since Minister Chen Yu of the Central Ministry of Fuel Industry instructed at the National Electricity Production Conference that it is necessary to eliminate and strive to eliminate several major accidents, line crimp accidents have been eliminated, and boiler steam and water pipe burst accidents have also been reduced by half compared with the same period last year. Leading cadres of the Liaoyuan Electric Power Bureau, Taiyuan No. 2 Power Plant, and Taiyuan Line No. 2 District went deep into the grassroots, earnestly implemented equipment maintenance and anti-accident measures, and accidents were significantly reduced.

Although the national electricity production has achieved great results in the first half of this year, the completion of the plan is not comprehensive or balanced enough. Calculated by the total value of production, although the task was overfulfilled in the first half of the year, only 99.8% of the monthly plan was completed in June. Three major regions, namely East China, Southwest, and Northwest, have failed to complete the power generation task for three consecutive months. In terms of coal consumption, plant electricity consumption, and line losses, many units have also failed to complete their tasks. Due to the fact that safety work in some areas is still not good enough, the amount of electricity lost due to accidents has even increased compared with the same period last year. In particular, the quality of maintenance needs to be further improved.

### 国营电业超额完成上半年计划

    国营电业超额完成上半年计划
    【本报讯】全国国营电业上半年以百分之一○四超额完成了国家发电量计划，与去年同期比较，提高了百分之二二·三，其中提高最多的是西北区达百分之八五，东北、华北等区也都提高了约四分之一。
    今年上半年电业生产中各项经济技术指标完成得也不错，计线路损失率较计划降低了百分之十，煤耗率较计划降低了百分之○·三。由于煤耗的降低，给国家节省的标准煤就达六千七百吨。这对降低发电成本是有一定作用的。
    自中华全国总工会发布关于在全国范围内开展技术革新运动的决定后，不少电业单位在原有的基础上进一步使技术革新运动形成高潮，并出现了不少有重大价值的技术改进。如太原第二发电厂劳动模范王凯山等，在五月份内集体研究实现了锅炉水位自动表示器等六项重要革新；湘中第三发电厂老工人曹逊泉与技术人员曾自福合作，解决了长期威胁某号汽轮机安全运行的飞环磨损调速器失灵的重大关键问题。
    今年上半年在安全发供电方面也有不少收获。自中央燃料工业部陈郁部长在全国电业生产会议上指示必须消灭和争取消灭几种重要事故以后，线路压接管事故业已消灭，锅炉汽水管爆破事故也比去年同期减少了一半。辽源电业局、太原第二发电厂以及太原线路二区等单位领导干部深入基层，认真执行设备检修和反事故的措施，事故显著减少。
    今年上半年全国电业生产虽取得很大成绩，但在完成计划上是不够全面、不够均衡的。以生产总值来计算，上半年虽超额完成任务，但六月份却仅完成月计划的百分之九九·八。华东、西南、西北等三个大区竟连续三个月未完成发电任务。在煤耗、厂用电、线路损失等方面，也有不少单位未完成任务。由于某些地区安全工作仍不够好，甚至因事故而少送电量比去年同期反增加了。特别是检修质量还有待进一步改进。
