    More Than 1,600 Cadres from Organs Directly Under the Central People's Government Prepare to Take the Entrance Examination for Renmin University of China
    Over 220 Graduate Students Will Graduate from Renmin University of China This Summer
    According to the "Decision on Guaranteeing the Completion of the 1954 National University Enrollment Plan" of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, forty-seven units directly under the Central People's Government have selected more than 1,600 young cadres to prepare for the entrance examination for Renmin University of China.
    In the past few years, Renmin University of China's undergraduate programs in industrial economics, economic planning, law, and agricultural economics, as well as specialized courses in statistics, finance and banking, and factory management, have trained many cadres for various departments. Among the 452 students who graduated from the six finance and economics departments in the summer of 1953, young cadres and workers sent by various organs and enterprises accounted for about 71%. The students studied advanced Soviet scientific theories and professional knowledge at the university and have made significant improvements in all aspects. They have played a significant role upon returning to their posts. These achievements have made various departments pay more attention to the work of selecting cadres for the examination this year. Various departments have also guaranteed the necessary study time for the cadres taking the exam while still working. (Xinhua News Agency)
    More than 220 graduate students will graduate from Renmin University of China. After the summer vacation, they will take on the task of lecturing on "Political Economy" and "Dialectical Materialism" in various universities.
    After two or three years of systematic study of Marxist-Leninist theory, the graduate students have made great progress in all aspects. Soviet experts personally taught them courses such as "Political Economy," "History of Philosophy," "Dialectical Materialism," and "Historical Materialism." Under the guidance of teachers, the graduate students studied relevant classic works and often combined their studies with the Party and the state's current policies. The graduate students in the Marxist-Leninist Research Class also collected some practical materials during their studies. Many graduate students researched issues related to China's economy during the transition period. Generally, they can analyze the selected research topic in a relatively in-depth manner.
    In order to cultivate the ability of graduate students to lecture independently after graduation, the graduate students have conducted trial lectures or led classroom discussions. Students in some classes, such as the Marxist-Leninist Evening University, are quite satisfied with the classroom discussions they lead. Three graduate students from the political economy branch of the Marxist-Leninist Research Class had never lectured before, but after more than a year of study and careful preparation before class, they were welcomed by the students when they gave trial lectures on "Socialist Transformation of People's Democratic Countries" and "Socialist Ownership."
    Most of the graduate students are political assistants transferred from various universities and some young intellectuals who have just graduated. There are also cadres selected and sent by the Central People's Government's People's Revolutionary Military Commission or other organs. After several years of study, they are all full of confidence to take on the role of people's teachers in universities. (Xinhua News Agency)

    中央人民政府所属各机关
    一千六百多名干部准备投考中国人民大学
    中国人民大学今年暑期将有二百二十多个研究生毕业
    中央人民政府所属四十七个单位，根据中共中央“关于保证完成一九五四年全国高等学校招生计划的决定”，已选出一千六百多名青年干部准备投考中国人民大学。
    中国人民大学设立的工业经济、经济计划、法律、农业经济系等本科、以及统计、财政银行、工厂管理等专修科的各专业，在过去几年中曾为各业务部门培养了很多干部。一九五三年暑假毕业的财经六个系的四百五十二名学生中，各机关、企业送来的青年干部及工人就占百分之七十一左右。学生们在学校中学习了苏联的先进科学理论和专业知识，在各方面都有显著的提高，他们回到工作岗位上发挥了很大的作用。这些成就使各部门更加重视今年选送干部报考的工作，各部门并为报考的在职干部保证了必要的温课时间。（新华社）
    中国人民大学将有二百二十多个研究生毕业，暑假后，他们将到各高等学校中担负起“政治经济学”和“辩证唯物论”等的讲课任务。
    研究生们经过二年或三年系统的马克思列宁主义理论学习，在各方面都有很大提高。苏联专家亲自为他们讲授“政治经济学”、“哲学史”、“辩证唯物主义”和“历史唯物主义”等课，研究生们在教师的指导下钻研了有关的经典著作，并经常结合党和国家当前的政策进行学习。马克思列宁主义研究班的研究生在学习中还搜集了一些实际资料。不少研究生研究了我国过渡时期经济方面的问题。一般的都能对所选定的研究题目较深入地分析。
    为了培养研究生毕业后独立讲授的能力，研究生们都进行了试讲或领导课堂讨论的工作。马克思列宁主义夜大学等某些班级的学员对于他们领导的课堂讨论都相当满意。马克思列宁主义研究班政治经济学分班的三位研究生从来没有讲过课，但经过一年多的学习和课前的认真准备后，在试讲“人民民主国家的社会主义改造”及“社会主义所有制”等课时，都受到听讲学员们的欢迎。
    研究生中大多是各高等学校调来的政治助教和一部分刚毕业的青年知识分子，也有中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会或其他机关选送来的干部。他们经过几年学习，都满怀信心地去担负高等学校的人民教师。　（新华社）
