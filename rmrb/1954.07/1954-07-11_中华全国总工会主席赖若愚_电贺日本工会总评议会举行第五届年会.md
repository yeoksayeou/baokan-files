Xinhua News Agency, July 10th: Lai Ruoyu, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, sent a telegram to congratulate the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan on the holding of its Fifth Annual Convention on the 12th. The text of the telegram is as follows: To the respected Mr. Minoru Takano, Secretary-General of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, and to the representatives of the Fifth Annual Convention of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan:

    I am delighted to learn that your trade union is holding its Fifth Annual Convention, and I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to the convention on behalf of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions.

    The Chinese trade unions eagerly hope for the increasing unity of the Japanese working class, the increasing development of friendship between China and Japan, and the friendly cooperation between the people of China and Japan. These are of great significance for the common interests of the people of China and Japan and for maintaining peace in Asia and the world.

    The Chinese working class is always concerned about the situation faced by our Japanese worker brothers and sisters today; we express deep sympathy and support for your trade union's struggle to defend the interests of workers and the entire nation, and for the Japanese people's opposition to the testing of hydrogen bombs in the Pacific. We firmly believe that victory will surely belong to the Japanese people.

    I wish your convention further achievements on the road to consolidating and expanding the unity of the working class, wish your convention a complete success, and wish the representatives good health.

    Long live the unity of the Japanese working class!
    Long live the friendly unity of the Chinese and Japanese working classes!
    Long live the friendly unity of the working classes of all Asian countries!
    Long live lasting peace in Asia and the world!

            Lai Ruoyu, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions
                        July 9, 1954
