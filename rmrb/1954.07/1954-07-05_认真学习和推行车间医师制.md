    Conscientiously Study and Promote the System of Workshop Doctors
    According to the spirit of the Third National Health Administration Conference and the First National Industrial Hygiene Conference, the medical and health departments of various factories and mines should actively study and promote the advanced Soviet industrial hygiene experience – the system of workshop doctors. Promoting this system can not only overcome the chaotic phenomenon in the medical and health departments of factories and mines but also gradually fundamentally improve the labor hygiene conditions of workers.
    The workshop doctor system is the basic organizational form for protective medical prevention for factory and mine workers. Some factories and mines in our country have already implemented it or are preparing to implement it. Today’s People’s Daily publication of the initial experiences of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant in promoting the workshop doctor system is worth referencing for the medical and health departments of various factories and mines. The experience of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant tells us that as long as the leadership of the factory or mine is determined, combines it with the actual conditions of the factory, conscientiously studies and researches the basic spirit and content of the workshop doctor system, fully mobilizes the masses, and clears the thinking of medical personnel and cadres at all levels in the workshop, it is entirely possible to promote this system in some larger factories and mines. Of course, due to the different specific conditions of various factories and mines, the steps to promote this system should also be different. For example, in some factories and mines with better medical conditions, this system should be gradually promoted. As for factories and mines with poorer medical conditions, they should start by understanding the essence of this system, organize medical personnel to spend a certain amount of time each week going deep into the workshops and sites, understanding the workers' work environment, labor conditions, and production processes, and first carry out preventive health work, laying the foundation for promoting the workshop doctor system. However, no matter what the conditions are, a positive attitude should be adopted towards the promotion of this system. It is wrong to overemphasize difficulties such as the shortage of medical personnel, the large number of outpatients, the lack of time to allocate, and the unfamiliarity of doctors with workshop hygiene work, and to not actively study and promote this system. According to investigations by the Central Ministry of Health and the health agencies of industrial departments, many factories and mines have the conditions to study and promote the workshop doctor system, but some leading cadres of factories and mines have conservative ideas and have not conscientiously studied and promoted this system.
    In addition, many medical personnel in factories and mines currently do not sufficiently recognize the superiority of the workshop doctor system, believing that it is similar to the current "workshop mobile diagnosis and treatment" method. This also affects the promotion of the workshop doctor system. Although "workshop mobile diagnosis and treatment" can save workers' time for seeing a doctor to a certain extent, and can also detect and treat diseases early, it mainly focuses on treatment and neglects preventive work. Therefore, it cannot, like the workshop doctor system, which closely combines medical treatment and prevention, fundamentally reduce the morbidity rate of employees. At the same time, this practice of performing treatment next to machine tools not only cannot achieve great results due to the influence of production operations but also hinders production. Soviet experience tells us that the main task of doctors going to workshops should not be to carry out simple treatments but to deeply understand the workers' work environment, labor conditions, and production processes, and to study at any time the various causes and prevention methods that affect workers' health, so as to reduce the morbidity rate of employees. The experience of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant also proves this point. Therefore, we believe that factories and mines that have already implemented "workshop mobile diagnosis and treatment" should, on the basis of doctors going deep into workshops and sites and establishing preliminary relationships with workers, gradually promote the workshop doctor system in a short period of time based on existing manpower and conditions.

### 认真学习和推行车间医师制

    认真学习和推行车间医师制
    根据第三届全国卫生行政会议和第一届全国工业卫生会议的精神，各厂矿医疗卫生部门应当积极学习和推行苏联工业卫生先进经验——车间医师制。推行这一制度，不仅可以克服厂矿医疗卫生部门的忙乱现象，而且可以逐步从根本上改善工人的劳动卫生状况。
    车间医师制，是对厂矿工人实行保护性医疗预防的基本组织形式，我国某些厂矿已经推行，或正准备推行。今天本报所发表的石景山钢铁厂推行车间医师制的初步经验，是值得各厂矿医疗卫生部门参考的。石景山钢铁厂的经验告诉我们，只要厂矿领导方面有决心，结合本厂的实际情况，认真学习和研究车间医师制的基本精神和内容，充分发动群众，打通医务人员和车间各级干部的思想，在某些较大的厂矿，是完全有条件推行这一制度的。当然，由于各厂矿的具体条件不同，推行这一制度的步骤也应有所不同。比如在一些医疗条件较好的厂矿，便应当逐步推行这一制度；至于医疗条件较差的厂矿，则应当从了解这一制度的实质着手，组织医务人员每周抽出一定时间，深入车间、现场，了解工人作业环境、劳动条件以及生产过程，先开展预防保健工作，为推行车间医师制建立基础。但不论条件如何，对于这一制度的推行，都应当采取积极的态度；过分强调医务人员少，门诊病人多，时间不敷分配，医师对车间卫生工作不熟悉等困难，不积极去研究和推行这一制度的态度，是不对的。根据中央卫生部和工业部门卫生机构的调查，不少厂矿是有条件学习和推行车间医师制的，但是厂矿的某些领导干部有着保守思想，没有认真学习和推行这一制度。
    此外，目前还有许多厂矿的医务人员对车间医师制的优越性认识不足，认为它跟现行的“车间巡回诊疗”方法差不多。这也影响了车间医师制的推行。“车间巡回诊疗”虽然在一定程度上可以节省工人就诊的时间，又能早期发现和治疗疾病，但它主要从治疗方面着眼，忽视预防工作，因而不能与医疗和预防紧密结合的车间医师制一样，从根本上降低职工患病率。同时，这种在机床旁边进行治疗的作法，不仅因生产操作的影响不可能收到很大的效果，而且还会妨碍生产的进行。苏联的经验告诉我们，医师下车间的主要任务，不应当是进行简易治疗，而应当是深入了解工人的作业环境、劳动条件和生产过程，随时研究影响工人身体健康的各种原因和预防方法，以便降低职工患病率。石景山钢铁厂的经验同样也证明了这一点。因此，我们认为，已经实行“车间巡回诊疗”的厂矿，应当在医师深入车间、现场，和工人建立初步感情的基础上，根据现有人力、条件，在短时期内逐步推行车间医师制。
