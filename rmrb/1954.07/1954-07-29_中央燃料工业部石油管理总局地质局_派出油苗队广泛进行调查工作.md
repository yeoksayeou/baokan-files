The Geology Bureau of the Petroleum Administration Bureau of the Central Fuel Industry Ministry
    Dispatches Oil Seep Teams to Conduct Extensive Investigation Work

    The Geology Bureau of the Petroleum Administration Bureau of the Central Fuel Industry Ministry, based on leads provided by the people in various places regarding mineral deposits, has dispatched two oil seep teams to carry out investigation work. The first team departed from Xi'an on July 10th and is heading to the areas north of Xining and Dulan in Qinghai, and the northern and southern foothills of the Qilian Mountains to work; the second team will also depart soon, heading to the eastern region of our country (north to Manchuria, Jiamusi, and south to Jiaxing, Zhejiang) to conduct extensive investigations.

    Since the beginning of this year, the Geology Bureau of the Petroleum Administration Bureau has received 47 pieces of mineral deposit information from the masses, including oil seeps, natural gas, asphalt, paraffin wax, oil shale, etc. These letters came from all over the country. For example, Comrade Luo Zhongxian of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, far away in Hainan Island, reported the oil seeps he saw locally; the Kazakh people in the Junggar Basin in Xinjiang reported oil seeps to relevant departments; Wang Duanbin, an old worker at the Beijing Brick and Tile Manufacturing Company, saw black water flowing from a crack in the stone, smelled an oily odor, and reported the mineral situation to relevant departments; mineral deposit reports were also made by farmers, cadres, and students from various places. The two oil seep teams dispatched by the Geology Bureau of the Petroleum Administration Bureau this year are to verify these oil seeps and provide an important basis for the country's future petroleum exploration work.

    中央燃料工业部石油管理总局地质局
    派出油苗队广泛进行调查工作
    中央燃料工业部石油管理总局地质局，根据各地人民群众报矿线索，派出两个油苗队，进行调查工作。第一队已在七月十日由西安出发，前往青海西宁、都兰以北和祁连山南北麓地区进行工作；第二队也将在最近出发，前往我国东部地区（北至满洲里、佳木斯，南至浙江嘉兴一带）进行广泛的调查。
    石油管理总局地质局今年以来，已收到群众报矿材料四十七件，其中有油苗、天然气、沥青、石蜡、油页岩等。这些信件来自全国各地。如远在海南岛的人民解放军某部的罗中宪同志，就报告了他在当地见到的油苗；在新疆准噶尔盆地的哈萨克族人民把油苗报告给有关部门；北京市砖瓦制造公司的老工人王端玢看到石缝中流出黑水，闻起来有油味，就将矿情报告给有关部门；报矿的还有各地的农民、干部和学生等。石油管理总局地质局今年派出的这两个油苗队，就是为证实这些油苗，并给国家今后的石油探勘工作提供重要的根据。（李宗道）
