    The State Physical Culture and Sports Commission of the Central People's Government
    Convenes National "Labor and Defense" System Work Conference

    In mid-July, the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission of the Central People's Government convened the National "Labor and Defense" System Work Conference in Beijing. More than sixty people attended the conference, including staff members from the physical culture and sports commissions of major regions and some provinces and cities, heads of typical schools promoting the "Labor and Defense" system, and physical education teachers.
    
    The conference lasted nine days. After deliberation and discussion, the representatives clarified that promoting the "Labor and Defense" system is the best system for developing mass physical education activities in schools. The "Labor and Defense" system has clear political goals and scientific content, which can motivate young people to exercise their bodies in preparation for labor and defending the country, and comprehensively develop the physique of young people in a step-by-step manner according to different ages, genders, and exercise foundations. The representatives unanimously agreed that under Chairman Mao's instruction of "good health, good study, and good work," physical education in our country's schools has been developing rapidly, and the ideological understanding and physical foundation of young students for physical exercise have generally improved. Based on this actual situation in our country, the current policy of promoting the preparatory level of the "Labor and Defense" system relatively widely and focusing on piloting the "Labor and Defense" system is correct, necessary, and possible. The conference believes that in promoting the "Labor and Defense" system in the future, it is necessary to correctly estimate subjective and objective conditions, and achieve preparedness and planning, without being conservative or rash. In schools, it is necessary to first arouse the attention of the administrative leaders of each school, and cooperate with the Communist Youth League and the student union to rely on physical education teachers and the vast number of active sports participants to play a backbone role; at the same time, it is necessary to pay attention to organically unifying physical education classes, extracurricular sports activities, and "Labor and Defense" system work. When local physical culture and sports commissions promote this work, they should strive for the joint leadership of educational administrative departments.

    During the conference, Cai Tingkai, Vice Chairman of the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission of the Central People's Government, and Rong Gaotang, Secretary-General, both attended and spoke. Wei Que, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government, emphasized in his report the tasks of secondary education during the country's transition period, and the role of the "Labor and Defense" system in implementing comprehensive development education. Representatives from schools that have focused on piloting the "Labor and Defense" system also exchanged pilot experiences at the meeting. (Xinhua News Agency)

    中央人民政府体育运动委员会
    召开全国“劳卫”制工作会议
    中央人民政府体育运动委员会七月中旬在北京召开了全国“劳卫”制工作会议。参加会议的有各大区、部分省、市的体育运动委员会的工作人员和推行“劳卫”制的典型学校的负责人以及体育教师等六十多人。
    会议历时九天。经过酝酿讨论，代表们明确了推行“劳卫”制是开展学校群众性体育运动的最好制度：“劳卫”制具有鲜明的政治目标和科学的内容，能激励青年为准备劳动与卫国而锻炼身体，和按照不同年龄、性别、锻炼基础循序渐进地全面发展青年的体质。代表们一致认为：在毛主席“身体好、学习好、工作好”的指示下，我国学校的体育运动已经日益发展，青年学生对于体育锻炼的思想认识和体力基础也普遍有了提高。从我国这一实际情况出发，目前提出较广泛地推行“劳卫”制预备级和重点试行“劳卫”制的方针是正确的、必要的、可能的。会议对今后推行“劳卫”制的工作认为必须正确估量主观和客观条件，做到有准备、有计划，既不保守、又不冒进。在学校里必须首先引起各校行政领导的重视，并和青年团、学生会配合、依靠体育教师和广大体育积极分子发挥骨干作用；同时必须注意把体育课、课外体育活动和“劳卫”制工作有机地统一起来。各地体育运动委员会在推行这一工作时，应争取教育行政部门共同领导。
    会议期间，中央人民政府体育运动委员会副主任蔡廷锴、秘书长荣高棠都到会讲话。中央人民政府教育部副部长韦悫在报告中，着重说明了国家过渡时期中等教育的任务，以及“劳卫”制在贯彻全面发展教育中的作用。已经重点试行“劳卫”制的学校的代表们，还在会上交流了试行的经验。（新华社）
