Ignoring Tradition

    After Churchill and Eden arrived in Washington on June 25, representatives of the U.S. Congress said that this time they would ignore established tradition and not invite Churchill to speak to Congress. Why were U.S. officials so cold to their "allies"? It is said that this was mainly due to a report Eden made in the House of Commons on June 23. Eden had said that the Southeast Asian aggressive bloc planned by the United States was "not a panacea now." Churchill, in his talks with U.S. congressmen, expressed his support for Eden's views. Therefore, the anger of U.S. officials was bound to be vented on Churchill.

    As everyone knows, in the joint statement and joint declaration issued by Eisenhower and Churchill regarding their talks, they repeatedly used words like "friendly" and "intimate" to exaggerate the "harmonious" relationship between Britain and the United States. However, the U.S. Congress representatives' disregard for tradition in their coldness towards Churchill made us realize what the so-called "harmony" of the United States is.

Tit for Tat

    On June 4, the U.S. government reduced the export price of its domestically extracted wheat by ten cents per bushel. That evening, Canadian Foreign Minister Pearson, in a speech, expressed dissatisfaction with the U.S. method of dumping at low prices in the international market to squeeze out Canadian wheat. After complaining, Pearson admitted that Western "unity" was problematic.

    Only three days after Pearson's speech, the Canadian Wheat Board reduced the price of their wheat by ten and one-eighth cents per bushel. A United Press International dispatch from Winnipeg, Manitoba, on June 7, said that the Canadian Wheat Board's action was in response to the United States' reduction of its wheat price by ten cents per bushel three days earlier.

    Constantly scheming to build one's own "prosperity" on the bankruptcy of others – this is the moral standard in trade among capitalist countries.

The Value of "Promises"

    Recently, when the U.S. government was bidding for the construction of four hydroelectric stations at the Chief Joseph Dam and The Dalles Dam, it awarded two construction contracts for the Chief Joseph Dam project to a U.S. electrical company. The British Electric Company, which submitted a lower bid, did not receive the contract. The British government was very dissatisfied with this. The British Under-Secretary for Trade, Mr. De Hescourt-Emory, said that Britain had expressed its "disappointment" to the U.S. authorities through its ambassador to the United States, and accused the U.S. of this policy of discriminating against British trade, which was clearly inconsistent with the U.S. president's statement that he would adopt a "more liberal policy" in trade.

    In fact, U.S. discrimination against British trade has a long history. According to a TASS dispatch from London on October 28 of last year, U.S. authorities, in order to prevent the sale of British "Comet" jet airliners in the United States, refused to issue a British license. At that time, although British Conservative Party member of Parliament Wilfred threw a fit, the British "Comet" aircraft still could not enter the U.S. market.

    Today, the British authorities probably have discovered how much their "ally's" "promise" of adopting a "more liberal policy" in trade is worth!

    美国和它的“朋友”
    不顾传统了
    六月二十五日，邱吉尔和艾登到了华盛顿后，美国国会的代表说，这一次他们将不顾既有传统，不叫邱吉尔到国会去发表演说了。美国官员们为什么对他们的“盟友”这么冷淡呢？据说，这主要是由于艾登六月二十三日在下院的一篇报告引起的。艾登曾说美国所策划的东南亚侵略集团并“不是现在的万灵药”，邱吉尔和美国国会议员们谈话时表示，他支持艾登的意见。因此，美国官员们的怒气势必要向邱吉尔发泄了。
    大家知道，艾森豪威尔和邱吉尔在关于他们会谈发表的联合声明和联合宣言中，曾经一再用“友好的”“亲密友爱的”这类字眼来渲染英美之间的“和谐”关系，可是，美国国会代表对邱吉尔这种不顾传统的冷淡，却使我们认识到美国的所谓“和谐”是什么东西了。
    以牙还牙
    六月四日美国政府把它从国内榨取来的每蒲式耳出口小麦的价格，减低了十分美金。当天晚上，加拿大外长皮尔逊在他的一篇演说里，就对美国在国际市场上用低价倾销来排挤加拿大小麦的办法，表示不满。皮尔逊发了一顿牢骚之后，他承认西方的“团结”是有问题的。
    皮尔逊讲过话以后，只不过三天，加拿大小麦局就把它们每蒲式耳小麦的价钱减低了十又八分之一分美金。合众社曼尼托巴温尼伯六月七日电讯说，加拿大小麦局的这个行动，就是对付三天前把每蒲式耳小麦减低十分美金的美国的。
    天天打算着把自己的“繁荣”建立在别人的破产上，这就是资本主义国家贸易上的道德标准。
    “诺言”的价值
    最近，美国政府在招标修建大约瑟夫水闸和达尔斯水闸的四个水电站时，把大约瑟夫水闸工程的两个修建合同给了美国的一家电气公司，而提出标价较低的英国电力有限公司反而没有得到。英国政府对这件事很不满意，英国贸易副大臣德·赫斯考特—埃莫里说，英国已通过它的驻美大使向美国当局表示“失望”，并指责美国这种歧视英国贸易的政策，显然是和美国总统说的要在贸易上采取“更为自由的政策”不相符合。
    其实，美国歧视英国贸易的事件，由来已久了。据塔斯社伦敦去年十月二十八日的电讯说，美国当局为了阻止英国的“彗星式”喷气客机在美国销售，曾拒绝发给英国执照。当时，虽然英国的保守党议员威尔菲尔德大发了一顿脾气，但是英国的“彗星式”飞机还是不能到美国市场上去。
    今天，英国当局大概已发现它的“盟友”关于在贸易上采取“更为自由的政策”这句“诺言”值多少钱了！
