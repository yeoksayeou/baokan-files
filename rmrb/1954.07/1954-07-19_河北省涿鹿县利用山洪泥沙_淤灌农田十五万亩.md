Zhuolu County, Hebei Province, utilizes Mountain Flood Sediment
Silt-Irrigates 150,000 Mu of Farmland

The Sanggan River, Yang River, and other tributaries in Zhuolu County, Hebei Province, experienced eight instances of rising water levels starting in mid-June, with the largest flow reaching over 1,000 cubic meters per second. The mountain floods carried large amounts of fertile sediment. In order to implement the policy of combining mountain flood prevention with silt-irrigation, and defense with utilization, the leading organs of Zhuolu County actively led the farmers along the rivers to utilize flood prevention and silt-irrigation projects. On one hand, they strengthened defenses to strictly prevent mountain floods from causing harm; on the other hand, they strictly controlled the water volume for flood silt-irrigation. In about twenty days, the eleven canals along the Sanggan River and Yang River within Zhuolu County silt-irrigated a total of 150,000 mu of farmland, of which over 11,000 mu of rice paddies were silt-irrigated three times, accumulating approximately three inches of fertile sediment. This will play a significant role in ensuring the realization of agricultural production increases.

    河北省涿鹿县利用山洪泥沙
    淤灌农田十五万亩
    河北省涿鹿县桑乾河、洋河和其它支流，在六月中旬，先后涨水八次，最大的流量达一千秒公方以上，山洪中挟带着大量肥沃的泥沙。涿鹿县领导机关为贯彻山区防洪与淤灌、防御与利用相结合的方针，积极领导沿河农民利用防洪淤灌工程，一面加强防守，严防山洪为害，一面严密控制水量，进行洪水淤灌。约二十天的时间，涿鹿县境内的桑乾河、洋河两岸十一条渠道共淤灌农田十五万亩，其中一万一千多亩稻田淤灌了三次，淤积肥沃泥沙约三寸厚，对保证实现农业增产将起重大作用。
