    Xinhua News Agency, New York, 16th -- According to a report by Harold Callender, the "New York Times" correspondent in Paris, the French National Economic Council issued a report on July 3rd discussing how France can avoid relying on "U.S. Aid." Mendès France was the chairman of the committee when this report was drafted.

    After analyzing the role of "U.S. Aid," the French National Economic Council pointed out in its report that "U.S. Aid" is increasingly military in nature and promotes "non-productive undertakings." The report stated: France, by accepting dollar "aid," has had to commit manpower, machinery, and materials to arms production as repayment, while these industries could originally have provided equipment for expanding French production.

    The report believes that to change this situation, military spending must be reduced and the structure of French industry must be changed to transfer more investment to productive uses, so that production and exports increase.

    法国国家经济委员会发表报告
    要求扩大生产不依靠“美援”
    【新华社十六日讯】纽约消息：据“纽约时报”驻巴黎记者哈罗德·卡伦德报道，法国国家经济委员会七月三日发表了一份报告，讨论法国如何才能不依靠“美援”的问题。起草这份报告时，孟戴斯—弗朗斯是委员会的主席。
    法国国家经济委员会在报告中分析了“美援”的作用后指出，“美援”愈来愈带有军事性质，助长了“非生产性的事业”。报告说：法国接受了美元“援助”，便不得不把人力、机器和物资投入军火生产作为报答，而这些工业原本是可以提供扩大法国生产的装备的。
    报告认为，要改变这种状态，就要削减军事开支，并且改变法国工业结构，以便把更多的投资转移到生产用途方面，使得生产和出口增加。
