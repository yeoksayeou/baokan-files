Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, July 18th: The Central and Southern Administrative Committee issued supplementary instructions on strengthening flood prevention and disaster relief work on July 17th, calling on all regions in the area to make persistent efforts to do a good job in flood prevention and overcome floods. At the same time, it called for vigorous leadership in flood-affected areas and vast non-disaster areas to carry out rural production increase campaigns, and to do a good job in disaster relief in a timely manner.

The Central and Southern Administrative Committee issued an emergency instruction on strengthening flood prevention work on June 21st. Provinces and cities throughout the area promptly and specifically deployed flood prevention work, mobilized and organized millions of people, and took various emergency measures to fight floods day and night, achieving great results. However, at present, rainfall is still concentrated in the Yangtze and Huai River basins, the water level of the Yangtze River is still very high, and the floods in Sichuan and Xikang have not yet arrived. Therefore, the supplementary instructions issued by the Central and Southern Administrative Committee on July 17th pointed out: In the Yangtze and Huai River coastal and lakeside areas, flood prevention work should still be the central task in the future. Raise vigilance, strengthen preparations, strive for flood prevention and rescue, and prevent any slackening of paralysis or tiredness and pessimism. According to the current situation and subjective and objective conditions, flood prevention work should adopt the principle of all-round defense and key strengthening. It is required that all localities universally carry out levee inspection and protection, reinforce dangerous sections, strengthen flood prevention command organizations at all levels, enrich leading backbones, establish a responsibility system for different sections, and closely link the upper and lower levels, and upstream and downstream. Strengthen the study of water conditions and the mastery of meteorology to ensure flexible command, mutual coordination, and appropriate measures. Especially in the main levee lines, sufficient manpower and material resources must be mobilized, and second and even third-line defense measures must be established to be prepared for any eventuality.

Regarding the current rural production and disaster relief work, the supplementary instructions proposed the following requirements: First, vigorously carry out agricultural production increase campaigns in vast non-disaster areas, advocate planting one more crop, plant other autumn crops in the inter-row of existing crops as much as possible, protect rice seedlings, rush to plant late rice, and strive for a bumper harvest; for areas affected by floods and inundation, in addition to doing a good job in emergency rescue work first and properly solving the living and accommodation problems of the affected people, we should further implement the principle of "production for self-rescue, thrift during famine, mutual assistance among the masses, supplemented by necessary government relief," widely convene meetings of disaster-stricken people's representatives or symposiums, collect opinions on production to overcome the famine, find various production methods, and formulate practical production and disaster relief plans. Taking the local mutual aid and cooperation movement as the center, lead the broad masses to carry out the production and disaster relief movement, actively drain waterlogging to facilitate timely replanting and change of planting, and use all methods to achieve the goal of "planting more and harvesting more." If disaster victims lack seeds, fertilizers, funds, etc. in resuming production, all localities should mobilize mutual assistance and borrowing among the masses to solve them, or provide loans and relief from the government. All localities should also carry out diverse rural sideline production in combination with agricultural production.

The supplementary instructions also pointed out: Strengthening economic work and public security work in disaster areas is also one of the important tasks in disaster areas at present. In terms of economic work: First of all, we must do a good job in supplying food, oil, salt and other materials to the disaster-stricken areas; the production tools needed by the disaster victims must also be actively raised and supplied in a timely manner; for the purchase of local specialties and sideline products in the disaster areas, the scope should be appropriately relaxed and actively purchased; at the same time, market management should be strengthened to strictly prevent illegal merchants from speculating on raising prices and suppressing prices; in addition, we should also actively assist in protecting the disaster victims' cattle and pigs. In terms of public security work: Governments at all levels should urge their subordinate public security, procuratorial, supervisory, and judicial departments to go deep into the disaster areas and strengthen their leadership to prevent hidden enemies from sabotage and maintain stable social order.

    中南行政委员会发出防汛救灾补充指示
    开展农村增产和生产救灾运动
    【新华社武汉十八日电】中南行政委员会七月十七日发出关于加强防汛救灾工作的补充指示，号召全区各地再接再厉为作好防汛工作、战胜洪水而努力，同时大力领导受涝受淹地区和广大的非灾区开展农村增产运动，并及时作好救灾工作。
    中南行政委员会六月二十一日曾发出关于加强防汛工作的紧急指示。全区各省、市都及时具体地布置防汛工作，动员组织千百万群众，采取各种紧急措施，夜以继日地和洪水展开斗争，获得了很大成绩。但目前雨水仍集中在长江、淮河流域，长江的水位还很高，四川、西康的洪水还没有到来。因此中南行政委员会七月十七日发出的补充指示指出：在长江、淮河沿岸和滨湖地区，今后仍应以防汛工作为中心任务，提高警惕，加强准备，努力防汛抢险，防止任何松劲麻痹思想或疲沓、悲观情绪。根据当前情况和主客观条件，防汛工作应采取全线防守、重点加强的方针。要求各地普遍进行查堤护堤，加固险工险段，加强各级防汛指挥机构，充实领导骨干，建立分区分段的责任制，密切上级与下级、上游与下游之间的联系，并加强水情的研究和气象的掌握，以保证指挥灵活，互相配合，措施适宜。特别在主要堤线，必须调集足够的人力、物力，并建立二线以至三线防御措施，作到有备无患。
    关于当前农村生产和救灾工作，补充指示中提出的要求是：首先在广大的非灾区大力开展农业增产运动，提倡多种一造作物，尽可能在现有作物的间行中补种其他秋季作物，保护水稻秧荪（秧苗），赶种晚稻，争取丰收；对于受涝受淹的地区，除了先作好急救工作，妥善解决受灾群众的生活住宿问题外，应进一步贯彻“生产自救、节约渡荒、群众互助、并辅以政府必要救济”的方针，广泛召开灾民代表会或座谈会，收集对于生产渡荒的意见，找出各种生产办法，订出切实可行的生产救灾计划，以当地互助合作运动为中心带动广大群众开展生产救灾运动，积极排出渍水，以便及时补种、改种，利用一切办法达到“多种多收”的目的。灾民在恢复生产中缺少种籽、肥料、资金等困难，各地应动员群众之间互助互借解决，或由政府贷款、救济、各地还要结合农业生产，开展多种多样的农村副业生产。
    补充指示还指出：加强灾区的经济工作和治安工作，也是灾区当前的重要任务之一。经济工作方面：首先要作好受灾地区粮食、油、盐等物资的供应；灾民所需要的生产工具，也要积极筹措，供应及时；对于灾区的土产特产和副业产品的收购，应适当放宽范围，积极收购；同时要加强市场管理，严防不法商人抬价压价等投机活动；此外，对于灾民的耕牛和毛猪等，也应积极协助予以保护。治安工作方面：各级政府应督促所属公安、检察、监察、司法等部门深入到灾区去，并对其加强领导，以防止隐蔽敌人的捣乱破坏，保持安定的社会秩序。
