Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, July 28th:

Comrades, today the Polish People's Republic, in its capital, is hosting Comrade Zhou Enlai, Premier of the Government of the People's Republic of China, and his entourage.

Such a prestigious guest, an outstanding representative of a great country with close friendly and cooperative relations with the Polish people, visiting Poland is a major political event for the Polish people.

The political significance of this visit lies in the fact that it symbolizes a turning point in our lives, in the lives of the Polish people and the lives and history of the great Chinese people, over the past decade. The great Chinese people, in their long and victorious struggle against imperialist tyranny, have embarked on—just as we have—a new path of development. In the past, Poland and China were separated not only geographically. Now, although the geographical distance remains—this distance has not changed—trade between our two countries has developed unprecedentedly, and cultural cooperation has been unprecedentedly strengthened; although our two countries are far apart, we have unprecedentedly close and profound cooperation in all aspects of life. These are all of great benefit to both countries.

We are united by a friendship born of common aspirations, common interests, and the common struggle to defend peace. At present, this struggle for peace is of utmost importance to all working people around the world. Premier Zhou Enlai is visiting us on his way back from the Geneva Conference, which made a very important decision for the struggle for peace—the decision on the armistice in Indochina.

In warmly welcoming our distinguished guest, we must first of all extend our warm congratulations to him for this major victory of the entire peace camp. Premier Zhou Enlai personally played a very active and important role in achieving this victory. This victory will undoubtedly consolidate the world peace forces that are building a strong barrier against aggression and war forces.

The Polish People's Republic, together with India and Canada, has been invited to be one of the three countries participating in maintaining the terms of the armistice agreement, that is, maintaining lasting peace in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia.

People's Poland is very willing to undertake this new mission, because our country believes that cooperation in the cause of maintaining peace and international coexistence is one of its most important responsibilities. Our people's country is proud of the trust placed in it by countries and people who desire peace. The struggle for peace in Asia is inseparable from the struggle for world peace, which the great Soviet Union has persistently and effectively waged.

Today, in welcoming Comrade Zhou Enlai, we are welcoming a great fighter for peace and a great friend of People's Poland. His visit to our country will further strengthen the fraternal relations between our two liberated and free countries that are building a new life.

In expanding their creativity to improve the material welfare and cultural level of the working masses, the people of our two countries will, for their own benefit and for the benefit of the freedom of working people around the world, further expand and consolidate their friendship and political, economic, and cultural cooperation.

On behalf of The National Unity Front Committee of Poland, on behalf of the many representatives of the working people of our capital gathered here today, and on behalf of all the Polish people, I extend a warm and sincere welcome to Comrade Premier Zhou Enlai and all our distinguished guests.

    七月二十七日在华沙群众大会上
    贝鲁特同志的开会词
    同志们，波兰人民共和国今天在它的首都作东道主，欢迎中华人民共和国政府首长周恩来同志，以及他的同行者。
    这样一个富有声望的客人、和波兰人民有着密切的友好和合作关系的一个伟大国家的非常出色的代表来波兰访问——这是波兰人民的一个重大政治事件。
    这次访问的政治意义在于，它象征着过去十年我们的生活、波兰人民的生活和伟大的中国人民的生活与历史的转折点。伟大的中国人民在反对帝国主义暴政的长期而胜利的斗争中，已走上了——正如我们已走上了一样——一条新的发展道路。过去，波兰和中国之间是不仅在地理上有距离的。现在，虽然地理上仍有着距离——这种距离没有改变，但我们两国之间的贸易已有了空前的发展，文化合作有了空前加强；虽然我们两国相距甚远，但是我们之间有着生活各方面的空前紧密和深厚的合作。这些都对两国有着很大利益。
    我们是由产生于共同的愿望、共同的利益和保卫和平的共同斗争的友谊团结在一起的。目前，这种争取和平的斗争是和全世界所有劳动人民都有着极重要的关系的。周恩来总理是在从日内瓦会议归国的途中访问我们的，日内瓦会议为争取和平的斗争作出了一个很重要的决定——关于印度支那停战的决定。
    在热烈欢迎我们的贵宾时，我们首先要为整个和平阵营的这个重大胜利而向他致热烈的祝贺，对于这个胜利的取得，周恩来总理个人是起了非常积极的、重要的作用的。这个胜利无疑地将巩固正在树立反对侵略和战争势力的坚强壁垒的世界和平力量。
    波兰人民共和国，和印度、加拿大一道，被邀请为参加维护停战协定条款、也就是维护越南、老挝和柬埔寨的持久和平的三个国家之一。
    人民波兰非常愿意担负起这个新的使命，因为我们国家认为在维护和平和国际共处事业中进行合作是它最重要的责任之一。我们的人民国家对希望和平的国家和人民所给予它的信任感到骄傲。争取亚洲和平的斗争，是和争取世界和平的斗争，伟大的苏联所坚持不渝地、有效地进行的斗争分不开的。
    今天，我们欢迎周恩来同志就是欢迎伟大的和平战士，欢迎人民波兰的伟大的朋友。他来我们国家访问将更加加强我们两国正在建设新生活的解放了的自由的国家的兄弟关系。
    在扩大自己的创造性以提高劳动群众的物质福利和文化水平的工作方面，我们两国的人民将为了他们自己的利益和全世界劳动人民自由的利益，进一步扩大和巩固他们的友谊和政治、经济及文化合作。
    我代表波兰全国阵线委员会、代表今天在这里集会的我们首都劳动人民的许多代表，并代表全体波兰人民，向周恩来总理同志和我们所有的贵宾表示热烈的、诚恳的欢迎。
