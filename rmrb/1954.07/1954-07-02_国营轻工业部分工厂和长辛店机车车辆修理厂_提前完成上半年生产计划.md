    The Changxindian Railway Vehicle Repair Factory completed the state production plan for the first half of the year ahead of schedule: locomotives 11 days ahead, passenger cars 23 days ahead, and freight cars 11 days ahead.

    In the process of implementing the plan, the factory further promoted work plans and gradually established a dynamic table analysis system from top to bottom, which strengthened the interconnections between workshops and processes, enabling leaders to discover weak links in production early and solve problems in a timely manner. On the other hand, the locomotive pre-inspection recommended by Soviet experts was strictly implemented to determine the scope of overhaul, spare parts plans, and overhaul record books, etc., which ensured the supply of major parts and materials and reduced omissions and repairs.

    While implementing the work plan, advanced work experience was promoted. For example, the Kolesov tool method was used to turn wheel centers, increasing work efficiency by 187%; the bottom plate molding method and aluminum multiple model method were promoted, which increased casting efficiency by two to three times.

    The trade union mobilized the masses of workers to carry out patriotic labor competitions, which also played a significant role in completing the plan.

    长辛店机车车辆修理工厂机车提前十一天、客车提前二十三天、货车提前十一天完成上半年国家生产计划。
    该厂在执行计划的过程中，进一步推行了作业计划，并从上到下逐步建立了动态表分析制度，因此加强了各车间、各工序的相互联系，使领导上能及早发现生产中的薄弱环节，及时解决问题。另方面，又严格地执行了苏联专家建议的机车先期鉴定，确定检修范围、备品计划和检修记录簿等等，保证了重大配件和材料的供应，也减少了漏检漏修现象。
    在贯彻作业计划的同时，推广了先进的工作经验。如使用科列索夫车刀法镟轮心，提高工作效率百分之一百八十七；推行底板漏模法及铝制多种模型法等，使铸件效率提高两倍到三倍。
    工会发动职工群众开展爱国主义劳动竞赛，对完成计划也起了很大的作用。
