    Long Wenzhong Creates "Electric Grout Extrusion Bricklaying Machine"
    Preliminary Tests Show Approximately 16,200 Bricks Can Be Laid Per Day
    [Our Newspaper] Wuhan City model worker and Wuhan City Construction Company inspector, Long Wenzhong, has preliminarily completed the work of creating the "Electric Grout Extrusion Bricklaying Machine."
    The structure of this machine is very simple. The machine body is 104 cm long, 44 cm high, and weighs 34 kg. The machine is equipped with a small motor, which uses gears and chains to carry out bricklaying, grout extrusion, and automatic forward movement. The machine is equipped with a backboard and spring plate, so it does not require a "string line" to lay perfectly straight brickwork. Tests have proven that this machine can handle the main work of bricklaying – bricklaying and grout extrusion. Except for corners and angles, it can lay all kinds of brick walls. In the future, as long as an automatic mortar hopper is added to the front of the machine, then, in addition to the supply of bricks and mortar, it can handle all bricklaying work such as mortar spreading, bricklaying, and grout extrusion. The operation of this machine is also very simple; any young worker with a basic understanding of electricity can master it, and the walls built will be as good as those built by general skilled workers.
    This machine is operated by four people (two people to pass bricks, one to spread mortar, and one to control the machine – this was the labor organization during the test). Working nine hours a day, it can lay approximately 16,200 bricks (according to the general conditions of construction sites in Wuhan, 800 bricks can be laid per worker per day using trowel mortar; 1,500 to 2,000 bricks can be laid per worker per day using a mortar spreading tool). The walls built by this machine are tightly packed, the mortar joints are standard, horizontally and vertically straight, and very regular.
    Now, the Wuhan City Construction Company is preparing to select a construction site to officially use the electric grout extrusion bricklaying machine and will make further improvements.

    龙文忠创造“电动挤浆砌墙机”
    初步试验每天约可砌砖一万六千二百块
    【本报讯】武汉市劳动模范、武汉市修建公司检工员龙文忠创制“电动挤浆砌墙机”的工作已初步完成。
    这部机器的构造很简单。机身全长一百零四公分，高四十四公分，重三十四公斤。机器上装有小型马达，通过齿轮与链条，进行砌砖、挤浆和自动前进。机身后装有靠墙板和弹簧板，它不需要“挂线”，砌体就十分平直。这部机器在试验中证明可以担任砌墙中的主要工作——砌砖、挤浆。除角、?外，它可以砌各式各样的砖墙。将来，只要在机身前面加一个自动铺灰斗，那么，除了砖、灰的供应之外，它就可以担任铺灰、砌墙、挤浆等全部砌墙工作了。这部机器的操作，也非常简便，只要稍懂用电常识的青年工人就可以掌握它，砌出的墙将和一般技术工人砌的一样好。
    这部机器由四人操作（两人传砖、一人铺灰、一人掌握机器——这是试验时的劳动组织），每天工作九小时，约可砌一万六千二百块砖（根据武汉市一般工地情况，使用提刀灰每工每天可砌砖八百块；使用铺灰器每工每天可砌砖一千五到二千块）。这个机器砌出来的墙，紧密结实，灰口标准，横平竖直，十分规矩。
    现在，武汉市修建公司准备选定一个工地正式使用电动挤浆砌墙机，并将作进一步的改进。
