Xinhua News Agency, July 27th—Following the accidental and unfortunate incident involving a British transport plane over the Hainan Island area, the U.S. authorities, using this incident as a pretext, openly ordered the U.S. Air Force to invade Chinese airspace and attack and shoot down two Chinese patrol planes. This reckless, provocative, and aggressive action by the U.S. has aroused serious concern and dissatisfaction in Britain, France, and Japan.

According to an Associated Press dispatch from London on July 26th, British officials are very anxious about the U.S. Air Force's shooting down of Chinese aircraft. Britain believes that this action by the U.S. will threaten world peace.

According to a United Press dispatch from Paris, French officials have criticized the tactics employed by the United States with anxiety.

A United Press dispatch from Tokyo said that Japanese人士 (people) have expressed concern about the U.S. Air Force's shooting down of Chinese aircraft. They predict that this action will not win the U.S. any new friends in Asia.

Xinhua News Agency, July 27th—London dispatch: The British "Daily Worker" on July 26th criticized the U.S. for openly carrying out frantic provocations hostile to the Chinese people in the Hainan Island area, using the accidental and unfortunate incident involving a British transport plane as a pretext. The "Daily Worker" said: "If the United States had not turned this region into an area of ever-increasing war tension, then the tragic incident of this British Sky Master aircraft might never have happened." The newspaper also said: "War-monger Dulles is raving again. He is using the tragic incident of the Sky Master aircraft to launch a belligerent demonstration near the Chinese coast."
