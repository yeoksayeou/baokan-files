    Miao People Sing the Draft Constitution
    Deng Zhi'an, You Jiada
    The Communist Party is our savior,
    Leading us to turn over and be liberated;
    Being masters of our own house is truly joyful,
    Discussing the constitution must be earnest.
    The mountain songs become more beautiful as we sing,
    The more we learn the policies, the clearer our hearts become;
    The people's constitution is a bright lamp,
    Shining on our bright future.
    ………………
    From not far from the foot of Maha Slope, came waves of excited, thrilled, and intimate singing. This singing was melodious and simple, constantly attracting us, so we walked towards the place where the singing was coming from. Passing through the stadium, crossing a road, the singing became even louder. We walked along a row of neat, green poplars in front of the health clinic, and arrived at the Constitution Draft Propaganda Worker Training Class in Majiang County, Guizhou Province. Studying here were representatives from various ethnic groups in Majiang County. Just as we walked in the gate, we heard another burst of song:
    The draft constitution has stipulations,
    All ethnic groups are equal:
    Fraternal ethnic groups are closely united,
    Like one big family,
    Immediately after, a middle-aged man sang out his hatred for the old society with an incredibly hateful voice:
    Thinking of the past makes my heart ache,
    The landlord class had malicious hearts,
    Press-ganging soldiers, apportioning levies, demanding grain,
    The Miao people's lives had no guarantee.
    Wives and children scattered, so miserable,
    Half the year chaff and vegetables, half the year grain.
    Then he sang in a victorious and excited tone:
    Now we have turned over to be masters,
    Workers and peasants united as one;
    The draft constitution has stipulations,
    Rights and obligations must be remembered clearly.
    Hearing this, we shouted in unison: "Good!" The singing was interrupted by this "Good!" Several Miao farmers there saw us, they all smiled, and one of them quickly stood up to greet us:
      "Comrades, come and explain the constitution to us!"
      "You are studying the draft constitution very well, the mountain songs you sang just now were great!" Lao You said with a smile.
      "Comrades, the benefits of the constitution are endless! It's a pity we can't read, we can't remember so much, we only know it is our own constitution." The speaker was a young man named Li Jizhong, from Mandong Township, Third District, who was twenty-four years old this year. He told us that when he was about eighteen years old, the Bao chief Yang Guozhen extorted eighteen silver dollars from him when conscripting soldiers. Because he had no money, he was imprisoned for several days. Later, he asked a guarantor and promised to borrow money to give to the pseudo-Bao chief before he was released. He said that under that dark rule, the Miao people had no democratic rights. They didn't even know what an election was. The law was made by the landlords, and the poor were at their mercy. But he said excitedly: "Now it's different. Since Chairman Mao led us to turn over, we have been allocated land and houses, and our lives are getting better day by day. In the past, a family of six only ate a little more than one jin of salt a month, now we eat more than five jin, and each person can make two sets of clothes every year." At this time, he pointed to his indigo-dyed drill uniform and said: "Even our Miao people are wearing this kind of fine cloth uniforms!" His gratitude and joy were hard to describe. He continued: "Now we are truly the masters of the country, we can elect our own people to do things, and some Miao people have become township chiefs, district chiefs, and county chiefs. Even the national constitution has been given to us for discussion, and we are asked to make suggestions. Chairman Mao and the Communist Party are so thoughtful, truly thinking of our Miao people in every way!"
    Finally, he said that after returning, he would publicize the draft constitution to the people, so that everyone would understand the content of the constitution.
    We were talking enthusiastically when suddenly a farmer said: "Listen, they sing even better!" At this time, women's songs came from the house in the northwest:
    In the past, women suffered deeply,
    Now the law has stipulations,
    Men and women are equal,
    Feudal ideas must be corrected.
    The iron tree blooms red flowers after a thousand years,
    The people are masters of their own house,
    The draft constitution has been promulgated,
    Women all sing the victory flower.
    The singing was full of joy and laughter. The singing attracted us, so we walked over. There, a woman in her thirties, named Long Peiying, was a people's representative from Baisou Township. She was the most talkative and understood the most, and every sentence was spoken to the hearts of women. She said: "When I was six years old, my parents died, and my brother couldn't afford to raise me, so he sent me to work for the landlord Zhang Feizi in Lushan Zhouxi. I was small and weak, and I did all the heavy work. I didn't get enough to eat for most of the three meals, and I was often told to eat pig food. I was beaten almost every day of the year. When I was sixteen, I couldn't stand it anymore, so I ran away secretly. Because of the beatings and overwork, I got tuberculosis, and now my muscles and bones ache all over my body when it's cloudy and raining." Talking about this, her eyes were a little red, but she wiped her eyes with her sleeve and continued: "After liberation, our family of six was divided into eighteen picks of fields and many fruits. When there were difficulties in production, the government issued free agricultural tools, and the bank also loaned 300,000 yuan to us, so we bought a plow cattle; after organizing mutual aid groups, everyone elected me as the leader of the group. Last year, the whole group increased production, and also sold surplus grain to the state." The more she spoke, the more excited she became. Finally, she smiled and said: "Like us women, especially our Miao women, in the past we only hoped to be beaten less, and we couldn't even talk about managing national affairs, but now our Miao women have also come forward. I was elected as a people's representative and became the leader of the mutual aid group. The draft constitution clearly stipulates that men and women are equal, and our rights are even more guaranteed. The draft constitution tells us farmers to take the socialist road of mutual aid and cooperation. I guarantee to run the mutual aid group well when I go back."
    It was already late, we left the training class, but the Miao people's songs supporting the draft constitution still echoed in the sky:
    Large fields and large dams, green rice seedlings,
    The draft constitution is explained clearly:
    If farmers want to be rich,
    Mutual aid and cooperation is the broad road.
    In June, transplanting seedlings is busy,
    Propaganda of the constitution goes to every township,
    If farmers learn it well,
    National construction will be faster.
    Feudal oppression for thousands of years,
    Farmers had no democratic rights,
    Now we are masters of our own house,
    Thank you, benefactor Chairman Mao.
    The stars in the sky are bright,
    The articles of the constitution are remembered in our hearts,
    The people of the whole country are closely united,
    Guarantee that every article is implemented.

    苗家歌唱宪法草案
    邓治安　犹家达
    共产党来是救星，
    领导我们翻了身；
    当家作主真高兴，
    讨论宪法要认真。
    山歌愈唱愈好听，
    政策愈学心愈明；
    人民的宪法是明灯，
    照着我们好前程。
    ………………
    从离麻哈坡脚不远的地方，传来一阵阵又激动、又兴奋、又亲切的歌声。这歌声婉转而又纯朴，始终吸引着我们，我们就朝着发出歌声的地方走去。穿过体育场，横过一条马路，歌声就更加响亮了。我们沿着卫生院门前一排整齐的、碧绿的白杨树走过去，就到了贵州省麻江县宪法草案宣传员训练班。在这里学习的，有麻江县各民族派来的代表。当我们刚走进大门时，又听见一阵歌声：
    宪法草案有规定，
    民族一律都平等：
    兄弟民族团结紧，
    好像一个大家庭，
    紧接着，一个中年人用那带着无比仇恨的声音唱出他对旧社会憎恨的心情：
    想起从前好心伤，
    地主阶级坏心肠，
    抓兵派款乱要粮，
    苗家生活没保障。
    妻离子散好悲惨，
    半年糠菜半年粮。
    接着他又用胜利而兴奋的声调唱道：
    现在翻身当主人，
    工农团结一条心；
    宪法草案有规定，
    权利、义务要记清。
    听到这里，我们不约而同地叫了一声：“好！”歌声被这一声“好”打断了，那里的几个苗族农民看到我们，他们都笑了，其中有一个赶忙站起来打招呼：
      “同志，来帮我们讲讲宪法哟！”
      “你们学习宪法草案挺不错嘛，刚才唱的山歌多好！”老犹笑眯眯地说。
      “同志，宪法好处说不完哟！可惜我们不识字，记不到那么多，只晓得它是我们自己的宪法。”谈话的是一个青年，他叫李继忠，是三区漫洞乡人，今年二十四岁。他告诉我们：在他十八岁左右，保长杨国珍抓兵时要敲诈他十八块银元，因为无钱就被关了几天，后来托了保人，答应借钱来交给伪保长，才被放出来。他说，在那种黑暗统治下，苗家哪有民主权利，连什么叫选举都不知道，法律是地主兴的，穷人不过听其摆布。但他又兴奋地说：“现在可不同囉，自从毛主席领导我们翻了身，分了田地、房屋，生活一天一天地好起来，以前全家六口人一个月只吃一斤多盐巴，现在吃上五斤多，并且每人每年还能做两套衣服。”这时他指着自己的阴丹士林布的制服说：“连我们苗家都穿上了这种细布制服了！”他那种感激和喜悦是很难形容的。他接着说：“现在我们真正做了国家的主人，能选举自己的人出来办事，苗家也有人当了乡长、区长、县长，连国家宪法都交给我们讨论，还叫我们提意见。毛主席和共产党想得这样周到，真是处处为我们苗家着想啊！”
    最后，他表示回去后要向人民群众好好宣传宪法草案，让大家都懂得宪法的内容。
    我们正谈得很起劲，忽然有一个农民说：“听，她们才唱得好呢！”这时西北边房子里传来了妇女的歌声：
    过去妇女受苦深，
    如今法律有规定，
    男女一律都平等，
    封建思想要改正。
    千年铁树开红花，
    人民作主当了家，
    宪法草案公布了，
    妇女都唱胜利花。
    歌声里充满了愉快和欢笑。歌声吸引着我们，我们就走过去了。那边，有一个三十来岁的妇女，叫龙培英，是白手乡的人民代表，她最健谈，道理也懂得多，句句话都讲在妇女的心坎坎上。她说：“我六岁时爹妈就死了，哥哥养不起就把我送到炉山舟溪地主张肥子家帮工。我人小，力气弱，做的尽是重活，三顿没有两顿饱，常叫我吃猪食，一年三百六十天几乎天天要挨打。帮到十六岁时，我实在受不了，就偷偷跑了。由于挨打和劳累，我得了痨伤病，现在遇到天阴下雨满身筋骨就疼痛。”谈到这里她的眼睛有些红了，但她用袖子擦了擦眼接着说：“解放后，全家六个人分了十八挑田和许多果实，在生产中有困难，政府发给了无偿农具，银行还贷给了三十万元款，使我们买了一条耕牛；组织互助组以后，大家选我当了组长，去年全组都增了产，还卖了余粮给国家。”她越讲越兴奋，最后她笑了笑说：“像我们妇女，特别是我们苗家妇女，过去只望少挨些打，根本谈不上管理国家大事，可是现在我们苗家妇女也出头了，我被选为人民代表，并当了互助组长。宪法草案明文规定男女平等，我们的权利就更有保障了。宪法草案叫我们农民走互助合作的社会主义道路，我保证回去搞好互助组。”
    天已经晚了，我们离开了训练班，可是苗族人民拥护宪法草案的歌声仍然荡漾在天空：
    大田大坝秧子青，
    宪法草案讲得明：
    农民要想都富裕，
    互助合作大道行。
    六月里来薅秧忙，
    宣传宪法到各乡，
    农民弟兄学好了，
    祖国建设更快当。
    封建压迫几千年，
    农民没有民主权，
    如今当家作了主，
    感谢恩人毛主席。
    天上星宿颗颗明，
    宪法条条记在心，
    全国人民团结紧，
    保证条条都施行。
    ………………
