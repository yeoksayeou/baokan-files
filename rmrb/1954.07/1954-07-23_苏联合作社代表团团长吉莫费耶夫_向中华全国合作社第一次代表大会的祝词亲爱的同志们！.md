Comrades!

Please allow me, entrusted by the Central Committee of the All-Union Central Union of Consumer Societies, to extend heartfelt congratulations to all the delegates of your Congress and to the 160 million members of the national cooperatives of the great People's Republic of China on behalf of all members of the Soviet cooperatives, and to wish you victorious completion of your glorious task of meeting the growing needs of the free people of your country.

The Fourth Congress of Soviet Consumer Cooperatives in Moscow closed just over ten days ago. The delegates warmly welcomed the delegation from the All-China Federation of Cooperatives, which was invited to attend the conference.

The delegates were pleased to hear in the congratulatory speech by Comrade Meng Yongqian, head of the Chinese cooperative delegation, about the great achievements made by the supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels under the All-China Federation of Cooperatives in their work.

In your country, thanks to the rapid growth in the number of people joining cooperatives and the active participation of members in the work of cooperatives, and with cooperatives based on genuine democratic principles, the Chinese people's cooperative movement is developing along the right path, and there is a solid and reliable guarantee that its role in the national economic life will continue to increase.

Currently, millions of people in China are enthusiastically discussing the draft constitution of the People's Republic of China. This constitution opens up broad avenues for socialist construction and for the unprecedented growth of various sectors of the national economy, including the domestic cooperative movement.

It is written in your Republic’s draft constitution: "In international affairs, our country’s unwavering policy is to strive for the noble goals of world peace and human progress." This clearly reflects the policy of the Chinese government led by the great people's leader Chairman Mao Zedong, which is also fully in line with the aspirations of the peace-loving people of the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Vietnam, Mongolia, and all other countries, and is a reliable guarantee for consolidating world peace.

As you know, inspired by the thought of Lenin and Stalin, the Soviet people are now engaging in peaceful labor with great enthusiasm to implement the Party and government's resolutions on vigorously developing agricultural production and the production of daily necessities, and further improving Soviet trade.

The activities of Soviet consumer cooperatives are inseparable from the concrete realization of a major task put forward in these resolutions, which is to continuously improve the living standards and welfare of the Soviet people.

The work of Soviet consumer cooperatives is based on democratic principles, which ensures that the broad masses of members can most actively participate in the management of their own cooperatives.

The great development of commodity production in our country and the great achievements in agricultural development have enabled the turnover of goods in Soviet consumer cooperatives to increase year by year. In this regard, the continuous increase in the real wages of working people, the continuous increase in the income of collective farms and collective farmers, and the gradual reduction of state retail prices of industrial products and food have also played a promoting role.

In the past three years, the retail commodity turnover of consumer cooperatives has increased by more than 50 percent. The turnover in the first five months of this year increased by 35 percent compared with the same period in 1953.

This year's cooperative commodity turnover will be double that of the pre-war period. The sales of commodities such as silk fabrics, furniture, bicycles, clocks, radios, gramophones, sewing machines, and motorcycles have increased the most, which is a particularly clear sign of the improvement of the material welfare and cultural level of the Soviet people.

Large-scale construction projects such as power stations, livestock farms, water conservancy irrigation facilities, and houses for collective farm members have been launched in collective farms, so there is a great demand for building materials. In the past six years, the amount of building materials sold to collective farms and rural residents has increased elevenfold. There has also been a large increase in the various machinery and equipment, engines, tractors, electric saws, electrical appliances, coal, petroleum products, and other commodities needed by collective farms for production sold by cooperatives.

The Soviet people have a traditional habit of not only talking about achievements when summarizing their work, but also paying more attention to the problems that have not yet been resolved and the existing shortcomings in order to overcome these shortcomings and promote the development of business more quickly.

Although the sales volume of commodities in rural areas has increased greatly, some commodities, such as automobiles and roofing materials, still cannot fully meet the needs.

At present, Soviet consumer cooperatives have more than 300,000 trade enterprises, procurement enterprises, and production enterprises.

This year, approximately 7,000 new stores and warehouses will be built, as well as many tea houses, canteens, bakeries, purchasing stations, drying factories, and other enterprises. The new investment this year will reach 1.8 billion rubles.

The business of consumer cooperatives purchasing and acquiring agricultural products and raw materials is also expanding year by year.

The Soviet government has given great trust to consumer cooperatives and has entrusted them with the task of purchasing and acquiring all potatoes, vegetables, and eggs.

Consumer cooperatives also account for a large proportion of the procurement of many other products.

It is also necessary to talk about the international activities of the All-Union Central Union of Consumer Societies. Soviet cooperative workers actively participate in international activities. The All-Union Central Union of Consumer Societies is a member of the International Cooperative Alliance. Representatives of Soviet cooperatives and representatives of progressive cooperative movements in Czechoslovakia, Romania, Bulgaria, and other countries have always advocated further development of the international cooperative movement, absorbing more countries' cooperative organizations into the ranks of the International Cooperative Alliance, establishing closer economic ties between cooperative organizations of various countries, and advocating that the International Cooperative Alliance actively participate in the struggle for peace and international security.

However, it must be pointed out that there are still some people among the leaders of the International Cooperative Alliance who have embarked on the path of ignoring the wishes of the masses and failing to fulfill the will of the people.

The cooperative organizations of several countries, such as Hungary, Albania, the Mongolian People's Republic, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the German Democratic Republic, have not yet been accepted as members of the International Cooperative Alliance. The only reason is that the political systems of these countries do not suit the tastes of some of these people. For the same reason, the International Cooperative Alliance Congress passed a resolution to expel the Polish cooperative from membership.

Soviet cooperative workers can never tolerate such violations of the charter of the International Cooperative Alliance. They do everything possible to strengthen and consolidate the international cooperative movement, so that this movement, not in words but in reality, unites the cooperative organizations of all countries, regardless of the existing political systems of various countries.

The issue of establishing and developing trade ties between cooperative organizations of various countries is an extremely important issue in the international cooperative movement. The successful resolution of this issue will help improve the socio-economic living conditions of the people.

Based on the proposal of Soviet cooperative workers, the issue of international cooperative trade will be discussed at the 19th Congress of the International Cooperative Alliance to be held in Paris in September 1954.

The establishment of lasting peace and security is what people all over the world expect.

The voices of hundreds of millions of people demanding the easing of international tensions and resolving international disputes through consultation are becoming increasingly firm.

The Soviet cooperative will, together with the Soviet people, continue to unswervingly defend the cause of world peace.

Dear friends! Please allow me, on behalf of all members of the Soviet cooperative, to express our heartfelt gratitude for your warm invitation to us to participate in this meaningful congress and, through all of you, to extend our heartfelt greetings to all members of the cooperative in your great country.

I wish the First National Congress of Cooperatives of China a success!

The cooperatives of your country are carrying out glorious work for the happiness of the people of the whole country, and I wish you victory in this glorious work!

Long live the great friendship between the Soviet and Chinese peoples!

Long live world peace!

Finally, in commemoration of the participation of the Soviet cooperative delegation in your congress, please allow me to present a small gift - a set of stationery specially made for you by a cooperative factory of the All-Union Central Union of Consumer Societies located in Moscow, with a pattern of Moscow University engraved on it.

### 苏联合作社代表团团长吉莫费耶夫  向中华全国合作社第一次代表大会的祝词亲爱的同志们！

    苏联合作社代表团团长吉莫费耶夫
    向中华全国合作社第一次代表大会的祝词亲爱的同志们！
    请让我遵照全苏消费合作社中央联合会委员会的委托，代表苏联全体合作社社员向你们代表大会的全体代表和伟大的中华人民共和国全国合作社的一亿六千万社员致以衷心的祝贺，并祝你们在满足本国自由人民逐年增长的需要方面胜利地完成自己的光荣任务。
    在莫斯科召开的苏联消费合作社第四次代表大会十几天以前刚刚闭幕。到会代表热烈地欢迎了应邀出席大会的中华全国合作社联合总社的代表团。
    到会代表以愉快的心情听到了中国合作社代表团团长孟用潜同志在贺词中谈到中华全国合作社联合总社所属各级供销合作社在工作中取得的巨大成绩。
    在你们国家里，由于群众入社的人数增长很快，社员积极参加合作社的工作，合作社以真正的民主原则为基础，因此，人民中国合作运动循着正确的道路发展，它在全国经济生活中的作用日益增大便有了坚实可靠的保证。
    目前，中国千百万人民正在热烈地讨论中华人民共和国宪法草案。这部宪法给社会主义建设，给国民经济各个部门（包括国内合作运动）的空前壮大打开了宽广的道路。
    你们共和国宪法草案中写到：“在国际事务中，我国坚定不移的方针是为世界和平和人类进步的崇高目的而努力”。这明确地反映了以伟大人民领袖毛泽东主席为领导的中国政府的政策，这也完全符合于苏联、捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚、越南、蒙古以及其他所有各国爱好和平人民的愿望，并且是巩固世界和平的可靠保证。
    你们知道，苏联人民在列宁—斯大林思想的鼓舞下，现在正在热情高涨地进行着和平的劳动，来实现党和政府关于大力发展农业生产和日用品生产、进一步改善苏维埃贸易等决议。
    苏联消费合作社的活动是和具体实现这些决议中所提出的一个主要任务分不开的，这个主要任务，就是不断改进苏联人民的生活福利。
    苏联消费合作社的工作是建立在民主原则之上的，这便保证广大社员群众能最积极地参加管理自己的合作社。
    我们国家的商品生产有了很大的发展，农业的发展也取得了很大成绩，这便使苏联消费合作社的商品流转额逐年增加。在这一方面，劳动人民实际工资的不断提高，集体农庄和集体农庄庄员收入的不断增加，工业品和食品国定零售价格的逐步减低也起了促进作用。
    最近三年来，消费合作社的零售商品流转额增加了百分之五十以上。今年前五个月的流转额比一九五三年同期增加百分之三十五。
    今年的合作社商品流转额将等于战前的两倍。销售额增加最多的是丝织品、家具、自行车、钟表、收音机、留声机、缝纫机、摩托车等类商品，这是苏联人民物质福利和文化水平提高的一个特别显明的标志。
    集体农庄中大规模地展开了发电站、饲畜房、水利灌溉设置、庄员住宅等建筑工程，因此，对建筑材料便有了很大的需求。在最近六年之内，卖给集体农庄和农村居民的建筑材料增为十一倍。合作社所卖出的各种机器设备、发动机、牵引车、电锯、电气用品、煤炭、石油产品以及集体农庄进行生产所需要的其他商品，也有了很大的增加。
    苏联人民有个传统的习惯，就是在总结工作时不仅谈到成绩，而且更注意那些尚未解决的问题，注意现存的缺点，以便克服这些缺点，更迅速地推动业务向前发展。
    虽然农村中的商品销售量大大增加，但有一些商品，像汽车、屋顶材料等等，还不能完全满足需要。
    目前，苏联消费合作社共有贸易企业、采购企业和生产企业三十多万个。
    今年，大约将增建七千个商店和仓库，以及许多茶馆、食堂、面包厂、采购站、干制厂等等企业。今年的新建投资将达十八亿卢布。
    消费合作社采购和收购农产品及原料的业务也一年比一年扩大。
    苏联政府对消费合作社予以极大的信任，把马铃薯、蔬菜和蛋类的采购和收购任务全部交给它去完成。
    消费合作社在其他许多产品的采购中也占有很大的比重。
    现在也有必要谈谈全苏消费合作社中央联合会的国际活动情况，苏联的合作社工作者积极地参加国际活动。苏联消费合作社中央联合会是国际合作社联盟的成员之一。苏联合作社的代表和捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚、保加利亚及其他几个国家进步合作运动的代表始终主张进一步发展国际合作运动，吸收更多的国家的合作社组织参加国际合作社联盟的队伍，主张各国合作社组织之间应建立更紧密的经济联系，主张国际合作社联盟积极参加争取和平和国际安全的斗争。
    但是必须指出，国际合作社联盟的领导人中间还有某些人物，他们已经走上了忽视人民群众愿望、不履行人民群众意志的道路。
    好些国家，如匈牙利、阿尔巴尼亚、蒙古人民共和国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、德意志民主共和国，它们的合作社组织至今还未被接受为国际合作社联盟的盟员，其唯一原因就是这几个国家的政治制度不合这些人物中某些人的口味。由于同样的原因，国际合作社联盟代表大会通过了一项开除波兰合作社盟籍的决议。
    苏联合作社工作者决不能容忍国际合作社联盟的章程遭受这样的破坏，他们尽一切力量争取国际合作运动壮大、巩固，使这一运动不是在口头上，而是实际上，不论各国现存的政治制度如何，把所有国家的合作社组织联合起来。
    建立和发展各国合作社组织之间贸易联系的问题，是国际合作运动中的一个极其重要的问题。这个问题的顺利解决，将有助于人民社会经济生活条件的改善。
    根据苏联合作社工作者的建议，关于国际合作社贸易的问题将在一九五四年九月在巴黎召开的国际合作社联盟第十九届代表大会上进行讨论。
    确立持久和平和安全，这是全世界人民所期待的东西。
    千千万万人民要求缓和国际紧张局势，通过协商办法解决国际争端的呼声，越来越坚定了。
    苏联合作社在今后仍将和苏联全国人民一起不屈不挠地维护世界和平事业。
    亲爱的朋友们！请允许我代表苏联合作社全体社员，对于殷切地邀请我们参加你们这次有意义的代表大会通过你们大家向你们伟大国家合作社全体社员致以衷心的感谢。
    谨祝中华全国合作社第一次代表大会成功！
    你们国家的合作社为了全国人民的幸福进行着光荣的工作，祝你们在这项光荣的工作中取得胜利！
    苏中两国人民的伟大友谊万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
    最后，为了纪念苏联合作社代表团参加你们这次代表大会，请允许我献上一件小小的礼物——全苏消费合作社中央联合会设在莫斯科市的一个合作社工厂特地为你们做的一套文具，上面刻有莫斯科大学的图样。　　　　　（新华社）
