Private railway workers said: Since the US hydrogen bomb test at Bikini Atoll, defending peace has become humanity's highest demand. Many people are gradually realizing that the enemy that destroys our lives and destroys peace is the same.
    All the staff of the Kyoto Prefectural Government Employees' Union have also signed the signature books prohibiting hydrogen bombs.

    日本人民扩展要求禁止原子武器的签名运动
    【新华社五日讯】东京消息：日本公众要求禁止原子弹、氢弹的签名运动不断开展。
    在东京的杉并区，截至六月二十日为止，全区三十九万人口中，已有二十五万三千七百三十人在禁止原子弹、氢弹的签名簿上签了名，区内许多地方都成立了有极广泛阶层的代表参加的签名运动执行委员会，举行了反对原子武器的讲演会、座谈会和收集关于反对原子武器的图画和文章等活动。
    日本各地的工人、职员非常踊跃地参加活动。群马县的教职员工会从六月二十七日起在县内各地征集禁止原子弹、氢弹的签名，在三天之内就征集了三万个签名；这个工会计划在七月十五日以前，达到征集十五万个签名的目标。在京都、大阪、神户地区，以日本私营铁道工会关西地方联合会为中心的签名运动，截至六月二日为止，已征得了十万多人的签名。私营铁道工人说：自从美国在比基尼岛试验氢弹以来，保卫和平成了人类最高的要求。许多人渐渐明白了破坏我们的生活和破坏和平的是同一个敌人。
    京都府职员工会的全体职员也都在禁止氢弹的签名簿上签了名。
