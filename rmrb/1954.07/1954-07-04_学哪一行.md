Which Profession to Choose
	Liu Shi

“Which profession to choose” is a question posed by real life to senior high school graduates. It is a significant step for young people as they embark on their life's journey, and they should answer it with a serious and conscientious attitude. However, this should not be seen as a purely personal matter, to be decided by young people in isolation or solely by their parents.

Strictly speaking, the process of young people determining their future path—which profession to pursue—should gradually take shape throughout the entire general education phase, from the first grade of elementary school to graduation from senior high school. Schools should, on the basis of providing a correct and all-around education, develop the individuality and interests of young people, educate them to understand the actual social life, adapt to the social division of labor and the overall needs of national construction, and cultivate their interest in pursuing various professions. By the end of the general education phase, if they continue their studies, they will have some mental preparation for the question of “which profession to choose.” Therefore, from an educational perspective, developing the individuality of young people is a requirement of people's education itself, and it is consistent with the needs of the country for training cadres, because the country needs talents in many fields, various types of talents. There is no irreconcilable contradiction between the country and the individual.

However, today's senior high school graduates have not been well educated in this regard during the general education phase. The reason is that our general education itself is still in the process of transformation. In the past few years, there were serious errors in the general education policy that deviated from life, socialist ideological education in schools was extremely weak, and the cultivation of students' individuality was barely addressed. Although young people have received a new education that is essentially different from that of the old China, and the qualities of new people are gradually taking shape, young people's understanding of socialism is still very abstract, their sense of political responsibility is not deep, and their life experience is very limited. In particular, they lack a very firm view of their own individuality and what they love. This is a general characteristic of current senior high school graduates. It is specifically manifested in the great blindness that still exists in dealing with the question of “which profession to choose.” According to last year's experience, many young people, because their individuality has not yet been prominently formed and they lack a correct understanding of the chosen subject or major, often choose majors with little basis. Therefore, some who originally filled in a certain subject or major as their first choice requested to transfer to another subject, department, or change their major after entering school, and some even had emotional problems for a long time and were not at ease with their studies. This year's national college enrollment plan stipulates eleven fields and two hundred and forty-two majors, and proportionally stipulates the number of students to be enrolled in each field. This is formulated according to the general tasks of the country during the transition period and the basic tasks of the first Five-Year Plan, and the needs of various national construction undertakings. This plan has two hundred and forty-two majors for young people to choose from, giving them ample opportunity to develop their individuality. However, according to a survey of the preferences of high school graduates in twelve schools in Beijing conducted recently by the Office of the North China Region College Enrollment Work Committee, the chosen fields and majors are still very narrow. Most people want to study engineering, while few choose other fields, and some fields have no one choosing them. Generally speaking, it is good to study engineering; but if everyone wants to go to one field, while some fields have no one to study, it will affect the completion of the country's plan to train cadres for various construction undertakings, which is not good. Moreover, even within engineering, most people concentrate on certain majors, and some majors have no one to choose. Does this mean that certain fields and certain majors are really not suitable for the individuality of the students in these twelve schools? Of course not. Their determined preferences still have a great degree of blindness.

The formation of this blindness is naturally inseparable from the fact that we have not fulfilled our due responsibilities in cultivating students' individuality in education, but today, a major factor is that young people are still influenced in their thinking by the remnants of the old society left over from their families, society, and even schools.

The old society drew a strict line between the division of social labor, the division of various professions, forming a social psychology with clear hierarchy and distinction between the noble and the lowly. School education was naturally permeated with this spirit and arranged according to this line. In old China, even among institutions of higher learning, various boundaries were drawn. For example, universities were considered higher than colleges and vocational schools, and within universities, comprehensive universities were considered higher than normal universities. Within comprehensive universities or specialized colleges, a certain school or college was considered higher than other schools or colleges. A certain major (then called a department) was considered higher than other majors. Domestic universities were considered lower than universities in capitalist countries. At that time, most of the people who could go to university were the children of landlords and the bourgeoisie, so their views on higher education were naturally stamped with the mark of their class. What was their standard for choosing? Generally speaking, it was based on the principle of being superior to others. Everyone wanted to enter schools, departments, and majors that were superior to others. Their purpose was for money, honor, and a position superior to others, and nothing else. This standard clearly reflected the thinking of the landlords and the bourgeoisie, which is not surprising. This thinking is also consistent with the individualistic principle of "only care about oneself, not others" in the old society.

Today, the situation has completely changed. The people of the whole country are building a prosperous and happy socialist society. All social labor is noble, and all professions are necessary for the social division of labor, without distinction between noble and lowly, high and low, and the state will also fully reflect this spirit in its wage policy. The interests of the individual and the state are completely consistent. The development of the individual does not depend on which profession one is engaged in, but on whether one is proficient in that profession, whether one has a spirit of selfless labor, and a spirit of innovation. Our school education has opened the door to all children of the working people. There are no longer any boundaries between institutions of higher learning. All schools, according to their nature, scientific system, and production needs, offer various majors; all schools must strictly implement the national plan for training cadres, and run the schools well according to certain standards. There is no longer any matter of who is higher or lower than whom in any aspect. Young people should use a new perspective to look at today's Chinese society, today's various professions, and today's institutions of higher learning; and should have the idea of preparing to participate in the construction of a socialist society, and use a new standard for higher education to replace that harmful bourgeois standard for higher education.

In order to raise young people's vigilance against bourgeois views on higher education, I would like to raise a prominent issue to the youth of the country, and ask everyone to give it serious consideration. That is, at present, many young people are extremely indifferent to the work of being a people's teacher, and are therefore unwilling to apply to higher normal schools.

Why are the youth of New China so uninterested in the work of being a people's teacher? Naturally, this cannot be fully explained by incompatibility with one's own individuality.

What is the position of teachers in New China?

Article 94 of the draft Constitution stipulates: "Citizens of the People's Republic of China have the right to education. The state establishes and gradually expands various schools and other cultural and educational institutions to guarantee citizens' enjoyment of this right. The state pays special attention to the physical and intellectual development of youth." According to the provisions of the draft Constitution, the Chinese people will all receive general education in the future, and gradually more people than now will receive higher education. This is necessary for building socialism; it is impossible to build socialism without culture. To ensure that the people have this right, it is necessary to gradually expand schools. In the past four years, we have actually done this, and our primary and secondary schools have expanded by one or more times than the highest number in Chinese history. This matter is related to every family in China, and it is a事业 of what a grand scale! Would this have no status in the great motherland?

What kind of work is the work of a teacher?

The object of teachers' labor is children and young people. It is to cultivate this new generation into new people with new qualities, who will become the builders of socialist and communist society in the future. The education from elementary school to senior high school graduation plays a decisive role for everyone, and good or bad will affect a person's life. The people cultivated by teachers are such people. Therefore, it is very appropriate for the Soviet Union to call teachers engineers of the soul. Aren't such engineers respected? Isn't it worthy of young people's aspiration?

The workplace of teachers is schools, classrooms, playgrounds, laboratories, and the living society; school work is scientific work and also artistic work. Teachers spend all day with innocent, flower-like children and young people. Isn't such work worthy of lifelong engagement?

Naturally, the situation in old China was completely different.

Since the profession of teacher in New China is such, what about the state's attitude towards normal education?

As far as higher normal education is concerned, it has undergone fundamental changes in the past four years, and the state has given due importance to normal education. Higher normal schools lacked independence in the higher education system of old China. Before the founding of the People's Republic of China, there were only a few independent normal colleges in the country. Most of them were affiliated to comprehensive universities, or a department of education was set up in the Faculty of Arts. The general equipment was simple, and there were few specialized teachers. In the past four years, in our national college and university adjustment, normal colleges have all been independently established. There are now twenty-six normal colleges and five normal vocational schools in the country. This year, because the number of students enrolled in higher normal schools accounts for 27.6 percent of the total number of students enrolled in colleges and universities nationwide, second only to engineering, it is also necessary to newly establish six normal vocational schools, and it is expected that more than twenty new schools will be added in total within five years. Higher normal schools will continue to expand gradually in the future according to the development of secondary education.

Higher normal schools in old China were not only discriminated against in terms of status, but also lacked a system of their own in teaching. Not long after the founding of New China, the government hired Soviet education experts to China to help with the work and study how to carry out fundamental reforms. In the past few years, higher normal schools, like other colleges and universities, have carried out a series of reform work according to the principle of learning from Soviet experience and combining it with Chinese reality, the most important of which is teaching reform. Now, normal colleges have formulated new teaching plans, and have formulated or are formulating teaching syllabuses for each subject. A large part of the teaching materials or teachers' lecture notes are adapted from the teaching materials of Soviet normal colleges or refer to their teaching materials. The teaching plan of normal vocational schools can be formulated and completed this summer, and the formulation of teaching syllabuses is also underway, and the teaching materials are similar to the situation of normal colleges, and are gradually being resolved.

What are the characteristics of the education content of normal colleges?

The characteristics of the education of normal colleges are determined by their training goals. Normal colleges undertake the task of training teachers for secondary schools. This is specifically reflected in the teaching plan. The teaching plan of each department of normal colleges includes four components, namely political theory subjects, education subjects, professional subjects, and educational practice. These four parts are closely related and form an organic whole. In normal colleges, special attention is paid to students' Marxist-Leninist cultivation, the cultivation of educational science, and as for professional subjects, such as physics, chemistry, and biology departments, the basic content is the same as that of comprehensive universities, the difference is that they also need to learn the teaching methods of each professional subject.

Therefore, the education of normal colleges today is different from the past. It already has an independent education system. This education system is completely composed according to the world's most advanced Soviet experience. If we still look at the problem with the old perspective, thinking that we can't learn anything from studying at normal schools and can't continue to do academic research work in the future, that is unfounded.

At present, normal colleges, like other universities or colleges, are constantly learning from the Soviet Union and carrying out teaching reform. In order to concentrate our efforts to gain experience in teaching reform, we have hired Soviet experts at Beijing Normal University and East China Normal University to serve as professors and assist us in our work. The Soviet experts' lecture notes are also distributed to all higher normal schools as teaching materials or references. Each higher normal school also exchanges lecture notes and experiences with each other.

Naturally, as far as the content of higher normal education is concerned, it is completely different from the era of old China.

Higher normal education still belongs to a comprehensive nature. At present, there are thirteen departments, including arts and sciences. Before the art department is separated from the normal college and becomes an independent art normal college, it also includes music and fine arts. Therefore, higher normal schools can absorb people with various personalities and hobbies.

In summary, higher normal schools cannot attract a large number of young people to strive for admission today, on the contrary, they are met with indifference. In addition to what some young people have proposed, "I don't know what I can learn in normal colleges," it is difficult for us to find reasons. This cannot but be attributed to the influence of the harmful tradition of despising normal education in old China. In order to comprehensively complete the college enrollment plan this year, I hope that young people will analyze and discuss the current problem of unwillingness to study at normal schools, and draw correct conclusions. At the same time, I also hope that those who are unwilling to study forestry, finance and economics, politics and law, or certain majors in engineering will also conduct an ideological analysis and draw correct conclusions, so as to clarify various confused thoughts and correct their attitude towards higher education.

For the socialist construction of the great motherland, I believe that young people will understand the ideology, respond to the call of the country, and consider their aspirations from various aspects, so as to ensure the completion of the college enrollment plan. The complete completion of the enrollment plan and the fact that every young person has chosen their favorite major are the common wishes of the country and the individual. There is a basis for the realization of this wish, because we all have a common goal of struggle, which is to build our motherland into a great socialist country. Today, no matter what we do, it is for socialist construction, so let us prepare from all aspects. Can't the difficult problem of "which profession to choose" really be solved correctly?

    学哪一行
    柳湜
    “学哪一行”对于高级中学毕业生是一个从现实生活中提出的问题。它是青年走向生活道路的重大的一步，青年们应该用严肃、认真的态度作出正确的回答。但这不能看作是一件属于个人的事，完全可以由青年们自己孤立无援地去选择，或者仅仅由家长们去作决定的。
    严格地说，青年们确定未来生活的趋向——干哪一行，应该在整个普通教育阶段，即从小学一年级到高级中学毕业这一长期教育过程中，逐渐形成。学校应在正确地进行全面发展的教育的基础上，发展青年的个性、爱好，教育他们体会社会实际生活，适应社会劳动分工和国家建设事业的全面需要，培养他们走向各行各业的志趣。到了普通教育阶段终结的时候，如果继续升学，那“学哪一行”的问题，他们也就有了一定的思想准备。所以从教育意义说，发展青年个性正是人民教育本身的一个要求，它和国家培养干部的需要是一致的，因为国家需要的人才是多方面的，是需要各种各类的人才的，国家和个人之间并不存在不可克服的矛盾。
    但今天高级中学毕业生，在普通教育这一阶段还没有很好地受到这方面的教育。原因是我们的普通教育本身还在改造过程中。过去几年，普通教育方针上还存在着脱离生活的严重的错误，学校里的社会主义思想教育还极薄弱，对学生个性的培养还谈不到。虽然青年们受到了比旧中国时代有着本质不同的新教育，新人的品质也在逐渐形成中，但青年对于社会主义的了解还极抽象，政治责任感还不深切，生活经验还极少，特别对自己个性和热爱什么还极没有十分坚定的看法。这是目前高级中学毕业生一般的特点。它具体表现在对待“学哪一行”这一个问题上还存在着极大的盲目性。根据去年的经验，有不少青年，由于自己的个性并未突出地形成，对所选择的某一科、某一专业又缺乏正确认识，选择专业常常是很少根据的。因此，原来在第一志愿上填上某科、某一专业的人，入校后，又要求转科、转系，或改变专业，甚至有的人长期在闹情绪，不安心学习。今年全国高等学校招生计划规定了十一个科，二百四十二个专业，按比例规定了各科招生的名额。这是根据国家在过渡时期的总任务和第一个五年计划的基本任务，国家各种建设事业的需要而制定的。这一计划有二百四十二个专业，可供青年选择，它给了青年们以充分发展个性的机会。但从最近华北区高等学校招生工作委员会办公室在北京市所作十二个学校高中毕业生的志愿调查中，看出所选择的科和专业仍十分狭隘，大多数的人都志愿考工科，其他的科就很少，甚至有的科连一个人也没有去选它。考工科，一般地说，是好的；但大家都志愿到一科，而某些科无人考，则影响国家培养各项建设干部计划的完成，那就不好了。而且就是以考工科来说，也多半集中在某些专业，有些专业也没有人选。这是不是说某些科，某些专业真的和这十二个学校的学生个性都不适合呢？自然不是的。他们所确定的志愿，仍然是带有极大盲目性。
    这种盲目性的形成，自然和我们在教育中对学生个性培养未尽到应有的责任分不开，但在今天，极大的因素却是青年们在思想上仍受着自己的家庭、社会甚至学校残存的那一种旧社会遗留下来的升学观点的影响。
    旧社会是把社会劳动的分工，各行各业的分工之间划了一条森严的界限的，形成了等级分明、贵贱有别的社会心理。学校教育自然是浸透了这种精神并按这种界限而安排的。在旧中国，连高等学校间也划了各种界限。如大学比学院、专科学校高一等，同样属于大学，综合大学比师范大学高一等，同是综合大学或专门学院，某一校，某一院又比其他院校高一等。某一专业（当时叫系）又比其他专业高一等。国内大学比起资本主义国家的大学又低一等。当时能考大学的人，大多数是属于地主、资产阶级的子女，因此，他们的升学观点，自然不能不打上了阶级的烙印。他们选择的标准是什么呢？一般说，就是按高人一等的原则，大家都要求进高人一等的学校，科、系。他们的目的是为了金钱、荣誉和高人一等的地位，以外，就什么也没有了。这种标准，正鲜明地反映了地主、资产阶级的思想，是不足奇怪的。这种思想又正和旧社会的那一条“只管自己，不管他人”的个人主义原则相一致的。
    今天的情况完全改变了。全国人民正在建设繁荣幸福的社会主义社会。一切社会劳动都是崇高的，各行各业都为社会分工所必需，无贵贱之分，高下之别，并且国家也将在工资政策上，充分体现出这种精神。个人和国家利害是完全一致的。个人的发展，不在于干哪一行，而在于自己是否精通哪一行业，是否有忘我劳动的精神，有革新的精神。我们学校教育为一切劳动人民子女打开了大门。高等学校间再也没有各种界限了，一切学校，按其性质，按科学系统，按生产需要，开设各种专业；一切学校，都要严格执行国家培养干部计划，按一定规格，把学校办好。再没有在任何方面，谁比谁高一等，低一等的事。青年们要用新的观点来看今天的中国社会，今天的各行各业，今天的高等学校；并应有为参加建设社会主义社会而作准备的思想，用一种新的升学标准去代替那种有害的资产阶级的升学标准。
    为了提高青年们对资产阶级升学观点的警惕性，我想向全国青年提出一个突出的问题来，请大家给以严肃的考虑。那就是目前有许多青年对于做人民教师工作表现得极为冷淡，因而不愿意报考高等师范学校。
    为什么新中国青年，对做人民教师的工作如此不感兴趣呢？自然，这完全不能用和自己个性不适合来解释的。
    教师的工作在新中国处在什么地位呢？
    宪法草案第九十四条规定：“中华人民共和国公民有受教育的权利。国家设立并且逐步扩大各种学校和其他文化教育机关，以保证公民享受这种权利。国家特别关怀青年的体力和智力的发展。”按宪法草案的规定，中国人民今后都将受到普通教育，逐步地有比现在更多的人受到高等教育。这是建设社会主义所必需的，建设社会主义，人民没有文化是不行的。要保证人民有此权利，就得逐步扩大学校，过去四年，事实上我们就是这样做的，我们的小学、中学都比中国历史上最高一年的数字扩大了一倍或一倍多。这件事是关系全中国每一个家庭的，是一件何等宏大规模的事业啊！这在伟大的祖国会没有地位吗？
    教师的工作是一种什么样的工作呢？
    教师劳动的对象是儿童和青年，是要把这新生的一代培养成为一种有新品质的，将来成为建设社会主义和共产主义社会的新人。从小学到高级中学毕业这一阶段的教育，对每一个人都有决定的作用，好坏要影响一个人的一生。教师所培养的就是这样的人。所以苏联把教师称做灵魂的工程师，是非常恰当的。难道这样的工程师会不受人尊敬吗？不值得青年向往吗？
    教师工作的现场是学校、教室、操场、实验室和活生生的社会；学校工作是科学工作，也是艺术工作。教师整天相处的是天真的、花朵一般的儿童和青年，难道这样的工作不值得终身从事吗？
    自然，在旧中国的情况那完全是两样的。
    新中国教师这一职业既然是如此，国家对于师范教育呢？
    就高等师范教育说，过去四年，已经有了根本的改变，国家对于师范教育已给了应有的重视。高等师范学校在旧中国高等学校体系中是缺乏独立性的，在中华人民共和国成立以前，全国只有寥寥几个独立的师范学院，大多数都附设在综合大学，或在文学院安置一个教育系，一般设备简陋，很少专设师资。近四年来，我们在全国高等学校调整中，师范学院已全部独立设置。现在全国有二十六所师范学院，五所师范专科学校。今年因为高等师范招生名额占全国高等学校招生总名额百分之二十七点六，仅次于工科，所以还须新办六所师范专科学校，预计五年内共要增设二十余所新的学校。高等师范学校今后还将根据中学教育的发展而逐步扩大。
    高等师范学校在旧中国，不仅地位上受到歧视，它在教学上也确实没有自成体系。新中国成立不久，政府就聘请苏联教育专家到中国帮助工作，研究如何进行根本的改革。过去几年，高等师范学校也和其他高等学校一样，根据学习苏联经验结合中国实际的原则，进行了一系列的改革工作，其中最主要的是教学改革。现在师范学院已制定了新的教学计划，已制定或正在制定各科教学大纲，很大一部分教材或教师的讲稿都是采取苏联师范学院的教材或参考他们的教材而改编的。师范专科学校的教学计划，在今年暑期内可以制定完成，也在着手制定教学大纲，教材也和师范学院情况相似，逐步在解决中。
    师范学院的教育内容到底有什么特点呢？
    师范学院教育的特点是由它的培养目标决定的。师范学院担负培养中学师资的任务。这具体表现在教学计划上。师范学院各系的教学计划，包含四个组成部分，即政治理论科目、教育科目、专业科目和教育实习。这四个部分密切关联着而组成了一个有机的整体。在师范学院里，特别重视学生的马克思列宁主义的修养，教育科学的修养，至于专业科目，如物理、化学、生物等系，基本内容和综合大学相同，不同的是还要学习各专业科目的教学方法。
    因此，师范学院今天的教育就和过去不一样，它已有了一个独立的教育体系。这一教育体系完全按照世界最先进的苏联经验组成的。如果还用旧的眼光来看问题，认为读师范学不到东西，将来不能继续作学术研究工作，那是毫无根据的。
    目前师范学院也像其他大学或学院一样，正在不断学习苏联，进行教学改革。我们为了集中力量取得教学改革的经验，在北京师范大学和华东师范大学聘有苏联专家，担任教授，协助我们进行工作。苏联专家的讲稿，同时发给所有高等师范学校作教学资料或参考。各高等师范学校也相互交换讲稿，相互交换经验。
    自然，就高等师范教育内容说，和旧中国时代相比，那完全是两样的。
    高等师范教育仍是属于综合性质的。目前十三个系，包括文理各科。在艺术系没有从师范学院分出独立成艺术师范学院以前，也包括音乐、美术。因此，高等师范学校正可以吸收各种不同个性和爱好的人。
    综上所述，高等师范学校在今天不能吸引广大的青年争取入学，相反地，反而遭到冷淡，除像有些青年所提出的，“不知道在师范学院里能够学到什么”以外，我们实难找到理由。这就不能不归到旧中国轻视师范教育那种有害的传统的影响了。为了今年全面地完成高等学校招生计划，我希望青年们对当前不愿学习师范这一个问题，进行分析和讨论，作出正确的结论。同时，也希望不愿学习林科、财经、政法或工科某些专业的人，同样进行一次思想的分析，作出正确的结论，以便澄清种种混乱思想，端正升学态度。
    为了伟大祖国的社会主义建设，我相信青年们是会搞通思想，响应国家的号召，多方面地考虑自己的志愿，以保证高等学校招生计划的完成的。招生计划完满完成而每一青年又选择了自己心爱的专业，这是国家和个人共同的愿望。这种愿望实现的基础是有的，因为我们都有一个共同奋斗的目标，就是要把我们祖国建设成为伟大的社会主义国家。今天无论做什么都是为了社会主义建设，我们就从各方面来作准备罢。“学哪一行”这一难题，难道真的不能正确地解决吗？
