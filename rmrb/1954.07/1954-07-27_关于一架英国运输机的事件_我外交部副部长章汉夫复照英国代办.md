Xinhua News Agency, 26th: Regarding the note presented by British Chargé d'Affaires Mr. D.W. Wilson to Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhang Hanfu on July 24 concerning the incident of a British transport aircraft, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhang Hanfu replied to British Chargé d'Affaires Mr. D.W. Wilson on July 26 regarding this incident. The original text of the reply is as follows:

Mr. Chargé d'Affaires:

Your note No. 122 of July 24, 1954, has been received. Regarding the incident of a British transport aircraft, I am instructed by the Central People's Government to explain the situation as ascertained through investigation, and request that you immediately inform the British Government.

The recent holding of the Geneva Conference and the agreement reached on the restoration of peace in Indochina have eased the international situation, for which the Chinese people and the people of the world are rejoicing. However, during this period, the remnant bandit gang of Chiang Kai-shek in Taiwan has further expanded the scope of harassment by its aircraft in the coastal areas and islands of China, including Hainan Island, and has airdropped special agents to infiltrate Chinese territory, carrying out pirate interception of merchant ships of various countries coming to China for trade, attempting to create a tense situation in Asia. Therefore, battles have frequently occurred in the coastal areas and islands of China.

According to reports received by our military organs from the Hainan Island area: On the morning of July 23, patrol aircraft of the People's Republic of China, while performing patrol duties over Yulin Port in Hainan Island, encountered a Chiang Kai-shek bandit aircraft over the area and engaged in combat. After receiving this information, the government of the People's Republic of China immediately conducted a thorough investigation and learned that the aircraft in question was actually a British transport aircraft, which our patrol aircraft mistakenly identified as a Kuomintang bandit aircraft invading our Yulin Port military base. This unfortunate incident was entirely accidental.

The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China expresses its regret for this accidental and unfortunate incident involving the British transport aircraft, and is taking appropriate measures to handle it. It expresses its sympathy, concern, and condolences to the casualties and their relatives, and is willing to consider providing appropriate compensation and reparations for the loss of life and property.

Please accept, Mr. Chargé d'Affaires, the assurances of my highest consideration.

    关于一架英国运输机的事件
    我外交部副部长章汉夫复照英国代办
    【新华社二十六日讯】英国代办杜维廉先生七月二十四日关于一架英国运输机的事件向我外交部章汉夫副部长提出照会，七月二十六日外交部章汉夫副部长关于此事件复照英国代办杜维廉先生，复照原文如下：代办先生：
    一九五四年七月二十四日第一百二十二号来照业已收悉。关于一架英国运输机的事件，我奉中央人民政府之命将经过调查所获悉的情况说明如下，请即转告英国政府。
    最近日内瓦会议的举行及关于恢复印度支那和平问题达成协议，国际局势获得缓和，中国人民和世界人民都为之欢欣鼓舞。然而，在此期间台湾蒋介石残余匪帮的飞机，向包括海南岛在内的中国沿海地区和岛屿较前更加扩大骚扰范围，并空投特务潜入中国境内，对前来中国通商的各国商船进行海盗拦劫，力图制造亚洲紧张局势。因此，在中国沿海地区和岛屿曾经常发生战斗。
    据我军事机关收到来自海南岛方面的报告：七月二十三日晨，中华人民共和国的巡逻飞机在海南岛榆林港上空执行巡逻任务之际，曾经与一架蒋匪帮飞机在该地上空遭遇，发生战斗等语。中华人民共和国政府得此消息后，即行多方面调查，始知该项飞机，实系英国所有的运输机，被我巡逻飞机误认为国民党匪帮飞机来侵袭我榆林港军事基地者。发生此项不幸事件，实完全出于意外。
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府对于此次英国运输机的意外不幸事件表示遗憾，并正在采取适当措施予以处理，对于在此次事件中伤亡者及其亲属表示同情、关怀与慰问，对于有关生命及财产损失愿意考虑给予适当的抚恤与赔偿。
    顺向先生致最崇高的敬意。
    此照英国代办杜维廉先生

                                于北京
