    Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, July 2nd: The restricted meeting of the nine-nation delegations discussing the restoration of peace in Indochina issued the following communique on the 2nd:
    "The nine-nation delegations continued to discuss the issue of restoring peace in Indochina at the restricted meeting on July 2nd. The next restricted meeting will be held on July 6th."
    Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, July 2nd: This correspondent reports: The nine-nation delegations continued to hold a restricted meeting on the 2nd to discuss the issue of armistice supervision in Indochina. It is understood that, in order to affirm the common ground between the two sides' positions and seek reasonable ways to overcome differences, the Soviet delegation made an important statement at the meeting. The Soviet delegation pointed out that the two sides have very similar views on the relationship and powers between the Joint Supervisory Commission and the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, and on the issue that the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission should not have armed forces. At the same time, there are still considerable differences on issues such as the composition of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and voting procedures. The Soviet delegation suggested that the delegations of various countries make greater efforts to reach an agreement on the issue of armistice supervision as soon as possible, so as to facilitate the work of the foreign ministers when they return in the future.
    Regarding the relationship between the Joint Supervisory Commission and the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, the Soviet delegation pointed out that the French delegation stated on June 25th and June 29th that it no longer insisted that one institution should be subordinate to the other. This shows that the French delegation has taken a step forward on this issue, and that the views of all parties have become somewhat closer. The Soviet delegation believes that, based on the principle of two institutions working in parallel and not being subordinate to each other, it would not be difficult to determine the scope of the two institutions' powers and formulate a draft resolution that everyone can accept.
    Regarding the procedure for implementing the recommendations of the Neutral Nations Commission, the Soviet delegation expressed its opposition to the view that the Neutral Nations Commission should have armed forces to implement its recommendations. Because this would mean occupying Vietnam, undermining Vietnam's sovereignty, and facilitating the resurgence of war. The Soviet delegation pointed out that the French delegation also advocated on June 25th that the Neutral Nations Commission should not have police forces, so it can be affirmed that there are no differences of opinion on this issue.
    The French delegation had argued that if unanimity could not be reached, the Neutral Nations Commission could submit its recommendations to the guarantor states. In this regard, the Soviet delegation pointed out that the Soviet proposal also considered that, if the Neutral Nations Commission deems it necessary, it could request the guarantor states to assist in implementing the measures necessary to fulfill the terms of the agreement. Therefore, this issue can also be affirmed as having been agreed upon.
    The French delegation also argued that the resolutions of the Neutral Nations Commission should be binding on both parties. The Soviet delegation expressed its hope that the French delegation would provide more explanations on this point. The Soviet delegation pointed out that since the recommendations of the Neutral Nations Commission can be submitted to the guarantor states, the Neutral Nations Commission can obtain work support from an institution that is stipulated as authoritative. If it is recognized that the recommendations of the Neutral Nations Commission are binding, the commission should have the means to force both parties to accept them. This would again lead to the issue of the Neutral Nations Commission having armed forces, which everyone has already expressed opposition to. The Soviet delegation believes that it is not necessary to emphasize that the commission's recommendations are binding, and proposed that the French delegation draft a procedure for implementing the Neutral Nations Commission's recommendations that everyone can accept. This procedure should promote the rapid resolution of disputes without involving the national independence and sovereignty of the parties concerned.
    Regarding the voting procedure within the Neutral Nations Commission, the Soviet delegation pointed out that the French delegation still advocates majority voting, while at the same time separately categorizing the most important issues. The French delegation also mentioned the issue of submitting majority and minority reports to the guarantor states. The Soviet delegation believes that it is still difficult to conclude whether the French opinion has moved forward on this issue, and it should be considered that the French delegation's position remains unchanged.
    Regarding the members of the Neutral Nations Commission, the Soviet delegation pointed out that the Soviet delegation put forward a new proposal on the issue of members on June 16th, with the aim of allowing other delegations to freely choose an agreement that everyone can accept. However, other delegations have not shown the sincerity to bring the two sides' views closer, as evidenced by the recent speech by the American delegation. The Soviet delegation also refuted the American delegation's distortion of the experience of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in supervising the Korean armistice.
    It is understood that, in addition to the Soviet delegation, the delegations of France, the United Kingdom, and Bao Dai also spoke at the meeting on the 2nd. In his speech, the French representative did not give a clear answer to the questions that the Soviet delegation asked him to explain.
    The speech by the Bao Dai representative completely did not exceed the expectations of observers here. Like a parrot, he copied the statements of the American representative, opposed non-capitalist countries participating in the Neutral Nations Commission, opposed relying on the sincerity of both parties to ensure the implementation of the armistice agreement, and repeated the trite tune of the United Nations monitoring the armistice. The speech by the Bao Dai representative once again confirmed the prevailing view here: the Bao Dai group is doing everything possible to obstruct the meeting from reaching an agreement with the support of the United States.

### 日内瓦会议举行限制性会议继续讨论印度支那问题  苏联代表团就停战监察问题作了重要发言

    日内瓦会议举行限制性会议继续讨论印度支那问题
    苏联代表团就停战监察问题作了重要发言
    【新华社日内瓦二日电】日内瓦会议讨论恢复印度支那和平问题的限制性会议二日发表公报如下：
    “九国代表团在七月二日的限制性会议中继续讨论恢复印度支那和平问题。下次限制性会议将在七月六日举行。”
    【新华社日内瓦二日电】本社记者报道：九国代表团在二日继续举行限制性会议，讨论有关印度支那停战监察的问题。据悉，为了把双方立场的共同点肯定下来，并谋求克服分歧的合理途径，苏联代表团在会议上作了重要的发言。苏联代表团指出：在联合监督委员会和中立国监察委员会之间的相互关系、职权以及中立国监察委员会不应拥有武装力量等问题上双方的意见都很接近，同时在中立国监察委员会的组成和表决程序等问题上，则尚存在着相当大的分歧。苏联代表团建议各国代表团作更大的努力，争取在停战监察问题上早日达成协议，从而便利于将来外长们回来时的工作。
    关于联合监督委员会和中立国监察委员会之间的关系问题，苏联代表团指出，法国代表团在六月二十五日和六月二十九日表示不再主张一个机构隶属于另一个机构，这说明法国代表团在这个问题上已前进了一步，并说明各方观点已有一些接近。苏联代表团认为，根据两个机构平行工作，互不从属的原则，就不难确定两个机构的职权范围，并制订出大家都能接受的决议草案。
    在如何执行中立国委员会建议的程序问题上，苏联代表团表示反对那种主张中立国委员会应拥有武装力量以执行其建议的意见。因为这意味着占领越南，破坏越南的主权，并将促成战争的再起。苏联代表团指出，法国代表团在六月二十五日也主张中立国委员会不应拥有警察部队，因此可以肯定在这个问题上各方并无分歧意见。
    法国代表团曾主张，如果不能取得一致，中立国委员会即可将其建议提交保证国。在这方面，苏联代表团指出，苏联建议中也曾考虑到，如果中立国委员会认为有必要，即可要求保证国协助实施为履行协定条款所必须的措施，因此这个问题也可肯定为已取得协议。
    法国代表团还曾主张中立国委员会的决议应对双方具有约束力。苏联代表团表示希望法国代表团对这一点作更多的解释。苏联代表团指出，既然中立国委员会的建议可提交保证国，那么中立国委员会就可从被规定为权威性的机构方面得到工作上的支持。如果承认中立国委员会的建议具有约束力，该委员会就应有迫使双方接受的手段，这样就又面临着中立国委员会应拥有武装力量的问题，而这是大家已经表示反对的。苏联代表团认为，没有必要强调该委员会建议具有约束力，并提议法国代表团拟出一项为大家都能接受的、执行中立国委员会建议的程序来。这个程序应促使争执得以迅速解决，而不涉及有关方面的民族独立和主权。
    关于中立国委员会内部表决程序的问题，苏联代表团指出，法国代表团仍主张多数表决，同时又要把最重要的问题单独分成一类。法国代表团也提到了可向保证国提出多数报告和少数报告的问题，苏联代表团认为，在这个问题上还难以得出结论说法国的意见是否已前进一步，而应该认为法国代表团的立场仍然未变。
    关于中立国委员会的成员问题，苏联代表团指出，苏联代表团在六月十六日提出关于成员问题的新建议，目的是为了其他代表团可以自由选择大家都能接受的协议，但其他代表团未表现出想使双方观点接近的诚意，美国代表团近来的发言就是证明。苏联代表团并据理驳斥了美国代表团对于中立国监察朝鲜停战经验的歪曲。
    据悉，除了苏联代表团之外，在二日会议上发言的还有法国、英国和保大的代表团。法国代表在其发言中，并没有对苏联代表团要求他解释的问题给予明确的回答。
    保大代表的发言完全没有超出此间观察家的预料，他像鹦鹉学舌一样地抄袭美国代表的说法，反对非资本主义国家参加中立国委员会，反对依靠双方的诚意来保证停战协定的履行，并重复由联合国来监察停战的滥调。保大代表的发言又一次证实了此间流行的看法：保大集团正在美国的支持之下千方百计地阻挠会议达成协议。
