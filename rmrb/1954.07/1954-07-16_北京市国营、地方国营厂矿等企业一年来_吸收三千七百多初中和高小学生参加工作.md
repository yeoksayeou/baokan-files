In state-owned and local state-owned factories and mines, post offices, trolley bus companies and other units in Beijing, more than 3,700 junior middle school graduates, dropouts, and elementary school graduates have been recruited since last summer vacation to participate in work. These students are young, enthusiastic, and have a certain level of education, and are progressing quickly in their work. The state-owned Beijing No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory recruited more than 800 elementary school graduates. After five months of learning, they can generally manage 24 automatic looms and operate 500 to 600 spindles of 20- or 21-count yarn. Currently, more than 600 people have officially joined production in various workshops. Cheng Yan, a high school graduate apprentice in the machine shop of the Beijing People's Machinery Factory, has been able to operate automated machines independently for production after more than half a year of study. He also won the second prize in this year's quarterly awards.

Under the tempering of actual work and the education of the Party, students have made rapid progress in their political thinking. For example, Zhang Shuping, an elementary school graduate postman at the Beijing Post Office, joined the post office last summer vacation after failing to enter middle school. At that time, she felt that the delivery work had no "future" and was not in high spirits. After studying in the training class, with the continuous help and education of the leadership and the Communist Youth League organization, her thinking stabilized and she became energetic in her work. After actively studying her work and humbly learning the work experience of veteran postmen, she quickly became familiar with the business. In more than half a year, she overcame various difficulties and delivered more than 50 "blind letters" without house numbers, wrong house numbers, or recipient names, which was praised by the masses. She said that she must work harder in the future and become a good servant of the people. Many junior middle school and elementary school graduates have been admitted as members of the Communist Youth League due to their continuous improvement in ideological awareness. More than a dozen postmen at the Beijing Post Office are applying to join the Communist Youth League, and more than 80 people at the state-owned Beijing No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory have recently been admitted to the Communist Youth League, most of whom are elementary school graduates.

After recruiting young students into the factory, the leaders of various factories and mines have adopted a series of measures to help and educate them in all aspects. Generally, factories and mining enterprises specifically organize students to study politics, technical theory, operating procedures, and various systems for one week to three months, depending on the specific circumstances. Units with a large number of people also specially set up more formal technical schools or training classes. Trade unions and Communist Youth League organizations of various factories and mines also carry out education on the glory of labor through welcome meetings, model deeds reports, and visits. After assigning work, the leaders generally helped them sign apprenticeship contracts for guaranteed teaching and learning. For example, the Beijing Electric Power Bureau's apprenticeship contract stipulates that students entering the bureau will be trained as third-level technicians within nine months. Most of the students in various units participated in spare-time schools and cultural tutoring classes. (Xinhua News Agency)

    北京市国营、地方国营厂矿等企业一年来
    吸收三千七百多初中和高小学生参加工作
    在北京市各国营、地方国营厂矿和邮局、电车公司等单位，自去年暑假以来共招收了三千七百多名初中毕业、肄业和高小毕业生参加工作。这些学生年轻、热情，有一定文化，在工作上进步较快。国营北京第一棉纺织厂招收的八百多名高小毕业生，经过五个月的学习，一般都能看管二十四台自动织布机，开二十、二十一支纱锭五百到六百个。目前已有六百多人正式在各车间参加生产。北京人民机器厂机工车间徒工高小毕业生程炎，经过半年多的学习，已能单独操作自动化机器进行生产了。在今年季度评奖中他还获得了二等奖。
    在实际工作的锻炼和党的教育下，学生们在政治思想上进步较快。如北京邮局投递员高小毕业生张淑萍，是去年暑假没有考上中学后进到邮局工作的。当时她感到投递工作没“前途”，情绪不高。经过训练班的学习，领导上和青年团的组织的不断帮助和教育，她的思想才稳定下来，工作也有了劲。经过她对工作的积极钻研，又虚心地学习了老投递员的工作经验，很快就熟悉了业务，在半年多时间内，她克服了种种困难，投出了五十多封没门牌、错门牌或没有收件人姓名的“瞎信”，受到了群众的赞扬。她表示今后一定要更加努力工作，成为一个人民的好勤务员。许多初中、高小毕业生由于思想觉悟的不断提高，已被吸收为青年团员。北京邮局有十几个投递员正在申请加入青年团，国营北京第一棉纺织厂最近有八十多人陆续被吸收加入青年团，其中绝大部分都是高小毕业生。
    各厂矿企业领导上在招收青年学生入厂后，采取了一系列的措施，从各方面对他们进行帮助和教育。各厂矿企业一般都根据具体情况专门以一周到三个月的时间，组织学生学习政治、技术理论、操作规程和各种制度等，人数多的单位还专门成立了较正规的技工学校或训练班。各厂矿企业的工会和青年团的组织并通过欢迎会、模范事迹报告会、参观等方式进行劳动光荣的教育。在分配工作后，领导上又普遍地帮助他们订立包教包学师徒合同。如北京电业局师徒合同上规定：九个月内将入局的学生培养为三级技工。在各单位的学生大多参加了业余学校、文化补习班学习。（新华社）
