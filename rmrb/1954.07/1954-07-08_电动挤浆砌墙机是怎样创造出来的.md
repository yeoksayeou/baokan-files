How the Electric Mortar-Extruding Bricklaying Machine Was Created
Long Wenzhong, Wuhan Municipal Model Worker, Inspector at Wuhan Construction Company

The electric mortar-extruding bricklaying machine has finally been manufactured, and I feel indescribably happy.

In the autumn of 1952, Comrade Wang Mingde successfully applied Su Changyou's double-handed mortar-extruding bricklaying method to the specific conditions of Wuhan. To adapt to this new operating method, many old practices needed to be improved. At that time, the company leadership repeatedly called on and encouraged us to use our brains, find tricks, improve operating methods, and improve tools to solve these problems. The entire company was swept up in a wave of learning and creating advanced experiences.

It was at this time that one day, at the construction site of the Second District Committee, I had just finished testing the mortar spreader when Li Weizhen, the director of the Municipal Real Estate Administration Bureau, and I squatted on the bricks and wood at the construction site to talk. Director Li encouraged me to find a way to automate the mortar spreader and turn the manual mortar extrusion into machine mortar extrusion. He told me that the future of the construction industry must be mechanized and industrialized, and that this would depend on everyone contributing their talents and wisdom. After returning that day, I made up my mind to manufacture a machine that could lay bricks.

First, in half a month, with the help of tinsmith Comrade Jin Juntang, I made the first machine based on the "forward expansion" principle of a locomotive. But this machine could not be used, and I felt very frustrated. At this time, Director Li and the company leaders came to encourage me again, asking me to persevere. They said, "Persistence is victory." At the same time, the leadership also wanted me to study with others and learn from their experiences.

At that time, I was unwilling to do this. I thought persistence was okay, but I didn't want to make it public and study with others. First, I was afraid that others would laugh at me: "A worker still wants to invent a machine?" Second, I wanted to wait until I succeeded before taking it out to show off that old Long was pretty good too.

From then on, I did some research and improvement intermittently. However, the results were very small. I often felt discouraged, thinking: maybe it won't succeed.

It wasn't until I saw the Soviet film "Donbass Miners" that my ideological situation changed. This film played a great role in promoting my work.

I saw the completely different lives of the Donbass miners before and after the October Revolution; I saw how the creation and application of the combine harvester improved the workers' working conditions; I saw the happy lives of the Soviet people today.

This reminded me of my own life in the old society. I am the son of an old carpenter. From the time I could remember, I had no parents and relied on selling my labor to live. I worked as an apprentice to carpenters and masons and did rough work in auto repair shops. Because I was small and not strong enough, I vomited blood from exhaustion when I was fifteen or sixteen years old. In the old society, I suffered all kinds of crimes, including being beaten, scolded, frozen, and starved. After liberation, the workers turned over and became masters of the house; however, our working conditions were still too poor. This was not only detrimental to the workers' health, but also slowed down national construction. And our internal and external enemies are constantly trying to sabotage our cause. Thinking of this, I asked myself: "Long Wenzhong, you are so confused! How come you haven't thought about these things! You are a member of the working class, is your creation just for yourself?"

After thinking this through, I became more energetic again and was determined to persevere.

In this film, I saw the structure of the combine coal mining machine, which is mainly driven by gears and chains, which gave me a great technical inspiration. I decided to manufacture a bricklaying machine in this way.

Later, the Second Wuhan Municipal Model Worker Congress was held, and the advanced thoughts and advanced behaviors of many worker brothers once again educated me, making me realize that the cause of the working class is a collective cause, and we must give full play to everyone's wisdom to create together. Then, the city's party and government leaders encouraged me when they visited the construction site. I thought: okay, even the leaders know about it, if I don't do it well, it will be even worse.

By the spring of this year, the machine was made. However, the machine needed an electric drill to be used as a motor. I was very embarrassed about this, thinking that this was the end, an electric drill costs five or six million yuan, would the leadership be willing to give this money to buy it? But things were not like this at all. When the leading comrades learned about it, they studied it with me for a long time, and went to consult with the Wuhan Municipal Finance Committee, requesting approval for this sum of money. In this way, the problem was solved. Moreover, the leading comrades also encouraged me, telling me not to be afraid of difficulties, and to go to them if there was anything that could not be solved.

At that time, I was still at the construction site. In order to allow me to concentrate on researching the bricklaying machine, the leading comrades specially transferred me to the company's Advanced Experience Promotion Committee, where there was nothing else to do all day long, just researching the machine. At the same time, the comrades of the Advanced Experience Promotion Committee also gave me a lot of help. In order to make my work go smoothly, they specially studied a bricklaying machine manufactured in Harbin and a bricklaying machine manufactured in Chengdu. Analyzing the advantages and disadvantages of these two bricklaying machines. They told me these materials, which saved me from taking many detours. At this time, most of the workers in the entire company were very concerned about this matter. They often came to my workplace, either to give advice, or to take a look, and often urged me: "Old Long, when will the machine be usable!"

The care and help of the leaders and comrades, their encouragement and urging, were of great encouragement to me. It made me feel the significance of the collective cause, the role of the collective; it also made me feel ashamed, ashamed of my past hesitation and unwillingness to make the research work public, my individualistic thinking. I thought, if I had taken the initiative to seek the help of more comrades earlier, this machine might have been created long ago. Soon, the Central South Construction Engineering Bureau sent a technical team to help me improve the machine. The company leadership also invited mechanical experts to help me identify whether it conformed to the principles of mechanical structure. It was a Sunday, and it was raining heavily. Bao Ding, the deputy director of the Urban Construction Committee, braved the rain to invite Zhao Peihai, the director of the Electrical Engineering Department of Huazhong Institute of Technology, and Huang Fengxiang, the director of a machinery factory. They carefully looked at the machinery and talked to me for a long time. They felt that there was no problem with the mechanical structure and that it all conformed to the principles. At the same time, these experts, engineers, and technicians used scientific knowledge to help me rectify the machine. Originally, the center of gravity of the machine was in the middle, and it swayed and jumped a little when it moved. They calculated it according to mechanics and felt that it would be better to move the center of gravity backward a little. As a result, the machine no longer jumped, and the extruded mortar was more uniform. In addition, the original machine could not build door and window lintels. After studying with the engineers, they designed a door and window bridge, so that door and window lintels could also be built.

These things moved me very much. Could the bricklaying machine have worked without their help? No, absolutely not. Only in China under the leadership of the Communist Party can workers give full play to their wisdom, and workers' inventions and creations will receive such support and care.

Even now, this machine is not perfect. In addition to my own efforts to continue to improve it, I hope that comrades will offer more suggestions to make it more perfect.

    电动挤浆砌墙机是怎样创造出来的
    武汉市劳动模范  武汉市修建公司检工员  龙文忠
    电动挤浆砌墙机终于制造出来了，我心中有说不出的高兴。
    在一九五二年秋天，王明德同志把苏长有的双手挤浆砌砖法在适合武汉的条件下运用成功了。为了适应这个新的操作方法，过去很多老的做法都需要改进。当时公司领导上，为了解决这些问题，一再号召、鼓励我们开动脑筋、找窍门，改进操作方法，改善工具。公司里上上下下都卷进了学习和创造先进经验的热潮中。
    就在这个时候，有一天，我在二区委工地里，刚试验过铺灰器，市房地产管理局李维真局长和我蹲在工地的砖块和木料上谈话。李局长鼓励我，要我想办法使铺灰器自动化，使双手挤浆变成机器挤浆。他告诉我建筑业的前途必须机械化、工厂化，这要靠大家把自己的才能智慧贡献出来。当天回去后，我就下了决心，一定要制造出一部可以砌墙的机器。
    首先，我在半个月的时间里，根据火车头前进的“生达伸缩”的样子，在白铁工金俊堂同志的帮助下做出第一个机器，但这个机器不能使用，我感到十分丧气。这时，李局长和公司领导同志又来鼓励我，要我坚持下去。他们说：“坚持就是胜利。”同时，领导上又要我多和别人研究，吸取别人的经验。
    当时我不愿意这样做。我觉得坚持下去可以，要公开出来和别人研究我可不干。第一、我怕别人嘲笑我：“工人还想发明机器”；第二、我一定要等成功了才拿出去，显显我老龙也不错。
    从此，我就断断续续地作了些研究与改进。但是，成绩都很小。我时常感到灰心丧气，觉着：大概成不了功。
    直到我看了苏联影片“顿巴斯矿工”，我的思想情况才改变了。这部影片对我的工作起了很大的推动作用。
    我看到顿巴斯矿工在十月革命前后截然不同的生活；我看到康拜因机的创造和运用怎样改善了工人的劳动条件；我看到了苏联人民今天的幸福生活。
    这使我想起了自己在旧社会的生活。我是一个老木工的儿子。从我能记事的时候起，就没有了爹妈，靠卖劳力生活。我做过木工和泥工师傅的徒弟，在汽车修理厂里干过粗活。因为，我人小力量不够，十五、六岁时曾累得吐血。在旧社会里挨打、挨骂、受冻、受饿，什么罪都受过。解放后，工人翻了身，当了家；可是，我们的劳动条件还太差。这不只是工人们身体吃亏，国家建设也搞不快。而我们的内外敌人时时刻刻地想破坏我们的事业。想到这里，我就问自己：“龙文忠，你好糊涂呀！这些事你怎么都没有想过！你是工人阶级中的一分子，难道你的创造只是为了自己吗？”
    我这样想通之后，劲头又大起来了。决心坚持下去。
    在这部影片中，我看到了康拜因挖煤机的构造，它主要是以齿轮、链条带动的，这给我技术上启发也很大。我决定照这个样子来制造砌墙的机器。
    后来，武汉市第二次劳动模范大会召开了，许多工人兄弟的先进思想和先进行为又一次教育了我，使我认识到工人阶级的事业是集体的事业，一定要发挥大家的智慧来共同创造。接着市的党政首长参观工地时又鼓励了我。我就想：好，连首长们都知道了，要是不搞好就更不行了。
    到了今年春天，机器做出来了。可是，机器上需要一只电钻做马达才能用。我为这事情很为难，心想这下完了，一只电钻值五、六百万元，领导上肯给这些钱去买吗？但事情全然不是这样，领导同志知道了，他们就和我研究了很久，又去和武汉市财委商量，请求批准这笔款子，这样，问题就解决了。而且，领导同志还鼓励我，叫我不要怕困难，有什么不能解决的事情就去找他们。
    那时，我还在工地，领导同志为了使我可以专心一意地研究砌墙机，又特地把我调到公司推广先进经验委员会，这里一天到晚什么别的事也没有，就是研究机器。同时，推广先进经验委员会的同志们也给了我很大的帮助，他们为了我的工作顺利，特地研究了哈尔滨制造的一个砌墙机和成都制造的一个砌墙机。分析这两个砌墙机有那些优点，那些缺点。他们把这些材料告诉我，使我少走了许多弯路。这个时候，全公司中大多数工人都很关心这事。他们时常到我的工作地点来，或者是提点意见，或者是专门来看看，还时常催促我：“老龙，什么时候机子才能用呀！”
    领导和同志们的关心和帮助，对我的鼓励和督促很大。使我感到集体事业的意义，集体的作用；也更使我感到羞愧，羞愧我过去那样迟迟疑疑地不愿把研究工作公开出来的个人主义思想。我想，假如，我更早地主动地争取更多同志的帮助的话，这部机器也许早就创造出来。不久，中南建筑工程局派来了一个技术小组，帮助我改进机器。公司领导上又请了机械专家来帮我鉴定，看看是不是符合机械构造的原理。这是个星期天，下着很大的雨，城市建设委员会鲍鼎副主任冒着雨请来了华中工学院电机系主任赵沛海和机械工厂厂长黄凤翔，他们很仔细地看了机械，又和我谈了很久，他们觉得机械构造没有问题，都符合原理。同时，这些专家、工程师、技术员根据科学知识，帮助我把机器整顿了一下。原来机器重心在中间，走动起来有点摇摆跳动，他们就根据力学计算了一下，觉得重心后移些就好了，结果，机器就不跳动了，挤的灰浆也更匀整了。还有，原来机器是不能砌门窗朵子的，经过和工程师们研究，设计出一种门窗过桥的东西，这样，门窗朵子也能砌了。
    这些事情使我很感动。砌墙机器没有他们的帮助，能行吗？不，决不行的。只有在共产党领导下的中国工人才有可能发挥自己的智慧，工人的发明创造才会得到这样的支持和关心。
    直到现在，这部机器还不是十全十美的。除了我自己应努力设法继续改进它，我更希望同志们多提意见，使它更加完善。
