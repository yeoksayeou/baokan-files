Why Doesn't the United States Dare to Admit the Fact of Invading Our Country?
Commentator of This Newspaper

The incident on July 26, in which several U.S. naval vessels and fighter jets intruded into our country's airspace and shot down two of our aircraft, is another lawless act of aggression and provocation by U.S. imperialism against the People's Republic of China. It has aroused anxiety and condemnation from public opinion in various countries. However, the United States still dares not admit the fact that it invaded our country.

U.S. Secretary of State Dulles and U.S. Secretary of Defense Wilson have successively issued statements and launched the U.S. propaganda machine, openly attempting to conceal and quibble about their guilt. They have even gone so far as to be so arrogant and unreasonable as to reverse black and white, falsely accusing our patrol planes of "attacking" U.S. aircraft performing the so-called "search" and "rescue" mission for British transport planes, and even making some kind of "protest" to our country. However, the facts cannot be denied, and the U.S. government absolutely cannot escape its guilt of aggression.

The U.S. government stubbornly insists that the incident of U.S. Air Force aircraft shooting down our patrol planes "occurred twelve miles outside Hainan Island"; while British Foreign Secretary Eden said that he "received a notification from the U.S. government" that the U.S. aircraft provocation incident occurred "thirteen miles outside Chinese territorial waters." It is clear at a glance that these are all thorough and despicable lies of the U.S. government. The facts are so clearly displayed: at 9:25 on July 26, four U.S. military aircraft intruded into the airspace above our Yulin Port; at 10:05 on the same day, twelve U.S. fighter jets intruded into the airspace above Lehui, located more than 100 kilometers east of Hainan Island, Therefore, the U.S. military aircraft provocation incident did not occur "twelve miles outside Hainan Island" or "thirteen miles outside Chinese territorial waters," but in the airspace of our People's Republic of China.

It is not difficult for people to see from the ambiguous statements of the U.S. government that the United States is trying to cover up its provocative actions of invading our country's airspace, so that it is stuttering and showing a guilty conscience. U.S. President Eisenhower once publicly stated that the actions of U.S. aircraft were for the purpose of so-called "self-defense." He denied that U.S. aircraft "had intruded into Chinese airspace," but ambiguously said: "We know for sure that our aircraft were where they should be." May we ask the U.S. government, why don't you dare to admit the simple facts? Why can't you even say the exact location where your military aircraft carried out armed provocations? What is the "place where they should be" for U.S. fighter jets? Could it be that the airspace above our Yulin Port and Lehui is the "place where they should be" for U.S. fighter jets? If the airspace above our Yulin Port and Lehui is regarded as the "place where they should be" for U.S. fighter jets, then can the airspace above San Francisco or San Diego in the United States also be said to be the "place where they should be" for Chinese fighter jets? Obviously, there is no need to prove how absurd this logic is. However, this is precisely what the U.S. government itself has confessed, that it dispatched naval vessels and fighter jets to invade our country's airspace, carry out provocations, and shoot down our aircraft, entirely out of its conspiracy plan, entirely a deliberate provocation, which is indisputable.

We must tell the people of the world: the U.S. fighter jets were not "where they should be" at all. They invaded the sacred and inviolable airspace of the People's Republic of China. The U.S. government must bear full responsibility for this provocative incident against the People's Republic of China.

The U.S. warmongering group hypocritically says that it sent fleets and aircraft to carry out so-called "rescue" missions. However, "everyone knows Sima Zhao's wicked intentions." The Chinese people have learned a lot about the fact that U.S. imperialism uses the name of false mercy to carry out aggression. Now, many people have also seen this from this incident. The Pentagon dispatched to "search" and "rescue" British transport planes were not rescue-type aircraft, but a mixed formation including two aircraft carriers and eight destroyers, as well as fighter jets taking off from the ships. U.S. news agency reports also admitted that this was an unusual action. The United Press said that not only the U.S. Seventh Fleet, but also part of the First Fleet, which was originally in San Diego, California, was sent to the "forward area," and the First Fleet was "directly ordered by Washington" to carry out this provocative mission. The news agency believes that "this is an unusual action, because even during the Korean War, it was considered unnecessary to put two fleets on the Asian sea."

An even more obvious fact is that the location of the British transport plane accident was in the airspace above Yulin Port, while the U.S. military aircraft that claimed to be "rescuing" the British plane intruded into the airspace above Lehui in our country, shot down two of our patrol planes that were guarding the motherland's airspace, and strafed Polish merchant ships and our escort ships in the high seas far from the location of the British plane accident. This clearly shows that the U.S. fleet and aircraft were not sent to carry out any "rescue" mission at all, but used the name of "rescue" to take the opportunity to provoke trouble and attack our patrol aircraft in an attempt to expand the situation. The U.S.'s deliberate act of aggression and provocation is a completely ironclad case and cannot be denied in any way.

It is only natural that public opinion in various countries has expressed dissatisfaction with this provocative behavior of the United States. The British "Manchester Guardian" said: Why were U.S. fighter jets still appearing on the Chinese coast three days after the British plane accident? "This may seem like a provocation." A reporter for the London "Daily Mail" also wrote: "We did not specifically ask the United States to take military action. As far as I know, the United States did not consult with the British government before sending two aircraft carriers (to the vicinity of Hainan Island)." Even U.S. Republican Congressman A. L. Miller said: "I don't think we have any reason to send our planes, ships and personnel to the coast of China." "It seems that some people (in the United States) are eager to try and are eager to fight."

What is noteworthy now is that the U.S. warmongering group is attempting to ignore our country's solemn protests and warnings and is still continuing its provocative activities. The Pentagon has not only not issued an order to withdraw the two aircraft carriers, but also, according to the United Press, "the United States has sent a third aircraft carrier" to the waters near Hainan Island in our country, and has clamored that "the United States will keep its aircraft carriers and aircraft in the South China Sea for as long as it needs to." U.S. President Eisenhower also declared on July 28 that U.S. naval aircraft carriers and aircraft were in the South China Sea to "defend American rights." This is obvious nonsense. The United States sent warships and aircraft to do evil in the sea more than 10,000 kilometers away from the U.S. border. What "rights" is this "defending"! Under the condemnation of public opinion in various countries, the U.S. naval authorities had to announce on July 29 that its "search" work had been stopped; however, it still declared that it would keep its three aircraft carriers in the South China Sea to conduct "training exercises" and "prepare for new emergencies." It can be seen from this how arrogant the despicable conspiracy of the U.S. warmongering group to deliberately provoke trouble and create tension has become.

According to a Hong Kong English newspaper: "An American message said that the United States may use the Hainan Island incident to 'collect' support for the Southeast Asia Treaty, but the effect may be to interrupt others' desire to follow." From this, people can see more clearly the warmongering face of the U.S. rulers who are hostile to peace, and they must be more vigilant about the adventurous actions of the U.S. warmongers.

    为什么美国不敢承认侵犯我国的事实呢？
    本报评论员
    七月二十六日，美国海军舰只多艘及战斗机群侵犯我国领空、击落我国飞机两架的事件，是美帝国主义对中华人民共和国又一次无法无天的侵略和挑衅暴行，引起了各国舆论的不安和谴责。但是美国却至今不敢承认它侵犯我国的事实。
    美国国务卿杜勒斯和美国国防部部长威尔逊先后发表声明，并发动美国宣传机器，公然企图掩饰和狡赖它的罪责，甚至蛮横无理到这样的程度，竟颠倒黑白，反诬我国巡逻机“袭击”执行所谓“搜寻”和“援救”英国运输机的任务的美国飞机，并向我国提出了什么“抗议”。但是，事实是不容否认的，美国政府绝对逃不掉它的侵略罪责。
    美国政府硬说，美国空军飞机击落我国巡逻机的事件是“发生在海南岛外十二英里的地方”；而英国外交大臣艾登说他“接到美国政府的通知”，美机挑衅事件发生在“中国领海以外十三英里的地方”。一望可知，这都是美国政府彻头彻尾的可耻的撒谎。事实是这样明明白白地摆着的：七月二十六日九时二十五分，四架美国的军用飞机侵犯了我国榆林港的上空；同一天的十时零五分，十二架美国战斗机侵入到距离榆林港一百多公里位于海南岛东部的乐会上空。因此，美国军用飞机的挑衅事件，既不是发生在“海南岛外的十二英里”，也不是发生在“中国领海以外的十三英里”，而是发生在我中华人民共和国领土的上空。
    人们从美国政府含糊其词的声明中就不难看出，美国因力图掩盖它侵犯我国领空的挑衅行动，以致言语支吾，表现了做贼心虚。美国总统艾森豪威尔曾公然声言美国飞机的行动是出于什么“自卫”的目的，他否认美国飞机“曾侵入中国的领空”，而含糊其词地说：“我们确知我们的飞机是在它们应当在的地方”。试问美国政府，为什么你们不敢承认简单的事实呢？为什么你们竟说不出你们的军用飞机进行武装挑衅的确切地点呢？什么是美国战斗机“应当在的地方”？难道我国榆林港和乐会的上空就是美国战斗机“应当在的地方”吗？如果把我国的榆林港和乐会的上空看成是美国战斗机“应当在的地方”，那末，美国旧金山或是圣地亚哥的上空是否也可以说是中国战斗机“应当在的地方”呢？显然用不着证明，这种逻辑是多么地荒谬的了。然而这正是美国政府自己所招供出来的，它派遣海军舰只和战斗机群侵犯我国领空，进行挑衅，击落我国飞机，完全出于它的阴谋计划，完全是一种蓄意的挑衅，这是无可争辩的了。
    我们必须告诉全世界的人们知道：美国的战斗机根本不是“在它们应当在的地方”，它们侵犯了中华人民共和国神圣不可侵犯的领空。美国政府必须对这次向中华人民共和国的挑衅事件负完全的责任。
    美国好战集团假惺惺地说它派出舰队和飞机是为了执行所谓“援救”的任务，然而，“司马昭之心，路人皆知”，中国人民对于美帝国主义假慈悲之名，而进行侵略的事实，是领教很多的。现在，许多人也从这次事件中看到了这一点。五角大楼派出“搜寻”和“援救”英国运输机的，并不是什么救护式的飞机，而竟是包括航空母舰两艘和八艘驱逐舰的混合编队以及由舰上起飞的战斗机群。美国通讯社的电讯也承认这是异样的行动。合众社说，这次不仅美国第七舰队，并且连原先在加利福尼亚州圣地亚哥的第一舰队的一部分也被派到“前进区域”，而第一舰队是“直接奉到华盛顿的命令”执行这次挑衅任务的。该通讯社认为“这是不寻常的行动，因为甚至在朝鲜战争期间也认为没有必要把两个舰队摆在亚洲海面上”。
    更明显的事实是：英国运输机意外事件发生的地点是在榆林港的上空，而自命“援救”英机的美国军用机却侵入到我国乐会的上空，击落了正在警卫祖国领空的我国两架巡逻机；并在距离英国飞机意外事件发生的地点很远的公海上，俯冲射击波兰商船及我国护航舰。这就再清楚也不过地说明了美国的舰队及飞机，根本不是被派去执行什么
  “援救”任务，而是假“援救”之名，乘机寻衅，袭击我国巡逻飞机，以图扩大事态。美国的这种蓄意进行侵略与挑衅的野蛮行为完全是铁案如山，无论如何也抵赖不了的。
    对于美国的这种挑衅行为，各国舆论纷纷表示不满是理所当然的。英国“曼彻斯特卫报”说道：为什么在英机出事三天之后，美国战斗机还出现在中国海岸，“这看来可能像是一种挑衅”。伦敦“每日邮报”记者也写道：“我们并没有特别要求美国采取军事行动。据我所知，美国没有和英国政府商量，就派了两艘航空母舰（到海南岛附近去）”。连美国共和党众议员阿·勒·米勒也说：
  “我不认为我们有理由可以派我们的飞机、船只和人员到中国海岸一带去”，“看起来，好像（美国）有些人在跃跃欲试，一心想打。”
    现在值得注意的是美国好战集团企图漠视我国的严正抗议和警告，竟还继续进行其挑衅活动。五角大楼非但还没有发出要这两艘航空母舰撤回的命令，而且据合众社透露，“美国已派了第三艘航空母舰”到我国海南岛附近的海面，扬言“美国将把它的航空母舰和飞机保持在南中国海，需要多长时间，就多长时间”。美国总统艾森豪威尔七月二十八日还宣称美国海军航空母舰和飞机在南中国海是为了“保卫美国的权利”。这是明显的胡说，美国派出军舰和飞机到远离美国国境一万多公里以外的海上来为非作歹，这是“保卫”什么“权利”！在世界各国舆论的指责之下，美国海军当局虽于七月二十九日不得不宣布它的“搜寻”工作已经停止；但是它仍然宣称要将它的三艘航空母舰留在南中国海，进行“训练演习”和“准备应付新的意外事件”。由此可见，美国好战集团蓄意寻衅、制造紧张局势的卑劣阴谋是到了何等狂妄的地步了。
    据香港的一家英文报纸透露：“有一个美国消息说，美国可能利用海南岛事件来‘搜罗’对东南亚公约的支持，但是效果倒可能是打断别人追随的念头。”由此，人们就更加看清了美国统治者敌视和平的好战面目，更加要警惕美国好战分子的冒险行动。
