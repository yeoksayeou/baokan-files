Xinhua News Agency, July 7th—National state-owned coal mines exceeded this year's first-half production plan by 4.2 percent. Among them, the Northeast region fulfilled 104.4 percent of its plan; the North China region fulfilled 103 percent of its plan; the East China region fulfilled 105.4 percent of its plan; the Central South region fulfilled 104.7 percent of its plan; the Southwest region fulfilled 110.1 percent of its plan; and the Northwest region fulfilled 108 percent of its plan. Compared with the same period last year, the national state-owned coal mines' coal output increased by a total of 31.3 percent, only over 900,000 tons short of the total output in 1950. As the output of state-owned coal mines increased, it was possible to fully supply the needs of industrial and transportation development and to appropriately take care of civilian use.

This year, in the first half of the year, the main economic norms of the national state-owned coal mine industry were also well executed. According to preliminary statistics (a small portion based on express reports), labor productivity increased by 2.8 percent compared with the plan, costs decreased by 3.35 percent, and the ash content of coking coal decreased by 0.15 percent. The reduction in the ash content of coking coal has a great effect on improving the quality of steel products.

In order to successfully complete the state production plan, coal mines in various regions began to make many preparations for this year's production at the end of last year. In the first half of this year, many coal mines strengthened planning management, gradually established a system of one-man leadership and production area management, and carried out labor competitions with technological innovation as the main content. As a result, production order gradually became normal, and the balance of production has greatly improved compared with last year. For example, the Hegang Mining Bureau's planned output this year increased by 11 percent compared with last year, but from January to May, it not only completed the state plan every month but also produced more than 66,000 tons of raw coal for the state. Employees of the Fuxin Mining Bureau put forward more than 70 innovation proposals in the first five months of this year. The implementation of these innovation proposals has played a great role in ensuring the overfulfillment of the state plan.

Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, July 7th—Anshan Iron and Steel Company has completed the state production plan for the first half of this year. The total output value exceeded the plan by 3.7 percent, an increase of 27.4 percent compared with the same period last year. Thirteen of the sixteen main products exceeded the plan, including steel ingots, which fulfilled 51.3 percent of the annual plan, seamless steel pipes, which fulfilled 69.6 percent, medium-sized steel, which fulfilled 56 percent, small-sized steel, which fulfilled 54.8 percent, and welded steel pipes, which fulfilled 57 percent. The quality of products generally met national standards and continued to improve. For example, the first-class product rate of heavy rails at the large rolling mill was 75.6 percent in January, which increased to 85.2 percent in May. The national plan stipulates that the convergence rate of medium-sized steel should be slightly above 94 percent, but it has actually reached 96 percent.

In the first half of this year, Anshan Iron and Steel Company also achieved good results in completing the state profit plan, cost plan, and labor productivity indicators. By the end of June, it is estimated that the profit plan could exceed the state plan by 12.6 percent. According to statistics from January to May, the actual cost was 4.8 percent lower than the state plan and 11.74 percent lower than the average cost for the whole of last year. From January to May, the labor productivity index exceeded the state plan by 4.87 percent.

In the first half of this year, Anshan Iron and Steel Company's production plants and mines implemented technological measures plans, which provided a reliable guarantee for the completion of the production plan. For example, after the primary rolling mill transformed the pass design of the twenty-four continuous rolling mill and built a new soaking furnace, the rolling capacity of the primary rolling mill increased by about 5 percent. The workers of each factory have a high enthusiasm for labor and constantly create new production records. The steelmaking plant even set two new daily output records in March. Through active research, employees have added more than 300 new products of different varieties and specifications to support national economic construction.

In order to strive to comprehensively complete the annual state production plan, Anshan Iron and Steel Company is studying specific measures for production work in the second half of the year, preparing to focus on strengthening and improving production technology management, formulating and revising technical regulations and product technical specifications, and improving the quality and quantity of products.

    全国国营煤矿和鞍山钢铁公司
    胜利完成上半年国家生产计划
    【新华社七日讯】全国国营煤矿超额百分之四点二完成了今年上半年的生产计划。其中东北区完成计划的百分之一百零四点四；华北区完成计划的百分之一百零三；华东区完成计划的百分之一百零五点四；中南区完成计划的百分之一百零四点七；西南区完成计划的百分之一百一十点一；西北区完成计划的百分之一百零八。与去年同时期比较，全国国营煤矿煤的产量共增加了百分之三十一点三，比一九五零年全年产量只相差九十多万吨。由于国营煤矿煤的产量增加了，做到充分供应工业和交通运输业发展的需要，并适当地照顾了民用。
    今年上半年，全国国营煤矿工业的几种主要经济定额，执行得也很好。据初步统计（有一小部分是根据快报数字统计），劳动生产率比计划提高了百分之二点八，成本降低了百分之三点三五，炼焦煤灰分降低了百分之零点一五。炼焦煤灰分的降低，对于提高钢铁产品的质量有很大作用。
    为了顺利地完成国家的生产计划，各地煤矿从去年年底就开始为今年的生产做了许多准备工作。今年上半年，许多煤矿加强了计划管理工作，逐步建立了一长制和生产区域管理制，并开展了以技术革新为主要内容的劳动竞赛，因而生产秩序逐步进入正常，生产的均衡情况也比去年有了很大进步。如鹤岗矿务局今年计划产量比去年增加了百分之十一，但从一月到五月不但月月完成了国家计划，而且还多为国家生产了六万六千多吨原煤。阜新矿务局的职工在今年头五个月中提出了七十多件革新建议。这些革新建议的实现，对保证超额完成国家计划起了很大作用。
    【新华社鞍山七日电】鞍山钢铁公司已完成今年上半年的国家生产计划。生产总值超额百分之三点七完成计划，比去年同时期增长了百分之二十七点四。十六种主要产品中有十三种超过计划，其中钢锭完成全年计划的百分之五十一点三，无缝钢管完成百分之六十九点六，中型钢材完成百分之五十六，小型钢材完成百分之五十四点八，焊接钢管完成百分之五十七。产品的质量一般都合乎国家标准，并不断有了提高。如大型轧钢厂重轨一级品率，一月份是百分之七十五点六，五月份就提高到百分之八十五点二。国家计划规定中型钢材的收合率是百分之九十四强，实际已达到了百分之九十六。
    鞍山钢铁公司今年上半年在完成国家利润计划、成本计划和劳动生产率的指标方面，也有了良好的成绩。到六月底，估计利润计划可超额百分之十二点六完成国家计划。据一月到五月的统计，实际成本比国家计划降低百分之四点八，比去年全年平均成本降低百分之十一点七四。从一月到五月，劳动生产率的指标超过国家计划百分之四点八七。
    今年上半年，鞍山钢铁公司各生产厂矿执行了技术措施计划，使生产计划的完成有了可靠的保证。如初轧厂改造二十四连轧机的孔型和新建一座均热炉后，使初轧机的轧钢能力提高了百分之五左右。各厂职工劳动热情很高，不断出现生产上的新纪录。炼钢厂在三月份内就连创了二次日产量的新纪录。职工们经过积极研究，增加了不同品种和不同规格的三百多种新产品，支援了全国经济建设。
    鞍山钢铁公司为了争取全面完成全年国家生产计划，正在研究下半年度生产工作的具体措施，准备以加强和健全生产技术管理为中心，制订和修订技术规程和产品技术规格，提高产品的质量和数量。
