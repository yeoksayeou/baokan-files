Xinhua News Agency dispatch:

    Under the instigation of American warmongers, the Syngman Rhee clique is intensifying preparations to launch new provocations, aimed at undermining the implementation of the armistice agreement and threatening the stability of the Korean armistice, following the breakdown of discussions on the Korean issue at the Geneva Conference by the United States.

    Syngman Rhee clamored in Seoul on June 25th that "I believe now is the time to request our allies to decide with the necessary courage and force" to oppose communism. He also threatened, "We are going to draw up plans for what we are going to do." Shortly before this, while inspecting Rhee's puppet army troops near the area south of the demilitarized zone on the western front, Syngman Rhee more openly clamored, "I am ready to order you to march north." According to Reuters, Syngman Rhee will hold a meeting within the week with the newly appointed Prime Minister Byun Young-tae, who has returned to Seoul from Geneva, and Lim Byung-jik, the South Korean observer to the United Nations recently recalled to Seoul, to formulate an "action plan" for launching new provocations. According to senior officials of the Rhee gang, "South Korea will take concrete steps as early as possible to forcefully demonstrate that it has abolished the Korean Military Armistice Agreement." These people also revealed that "the first action may be to demand that the United Nations Command drive all neutral nations' truce inspection teams out of South Korea." The United States' instigation of Syngman Rhee to plot this action is clearly an attempt to abolish the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, get rid of the constraints of neutral nations' inspection and supervision, so that it can carry out various destructive actions without scruples.

    At the same time, the Syngman Rhee clique is stepping up the expansion of its puppet army, preparing to launch new adventures. South Korean Army Chief of Staff Chung Il-kwon recently announced publicly that the Syngman Rhee clique has completed a plan to establish a large reserve force. The first batch of reserve force, comprising 187,000 officers and soldiers, will be established on July 1st. Syngman Rhee recently held intensive talks with Van Fleet, the former commander of the U.S. Eighth Army in Korea who came to the Far East to carry out aggressive deployments, demanding that the United States vigorously expand the ground forces of the Rhee puppet army, establish an air force equipped with jet aircraft and a navy equipped with cruisers and submarines, and increase U.S. military "aid" to South Korea.

    It is quite obvious that the provocative conspiracy being plotted by the Syngman Rhee clique is being instigated by the United States. After the Prime Ministers of China and India and the Prime Ministers of China and Burma respectively issued joint statements, the people of Asian countries are joyfully striving to ensure peace and security in Asia. The conspiracy of the United States is precisely against the people of all Asia. If it dares to take risks, it will inevitably suffer even greater defeats.

### 在美国好战分子指使下  李承晚集团策划新的挑衅阴谋

    在美国好战分子指使下
    李承晚集团策划新的挑衅阴谋
    【新华社讯】在美国破裂日内瓦会议关于朝鲜问题的讨论以后，李承晚集团正在美国好战分子的策动之下，加紧准备发动新的挑衅，来破坏停战协定的实施和威胁朝鲜停战的稳定。
    李承晚六月二十五日在汉城叫嚣说，“我认为现在正是时候，应该去请求我们的盟国决心用必要的勇气和武力”来反对共产主义。他还威胁说，
  “我们将要对我们所要做的事情拟出计划。”在这以前不久，李承晚在视察西线非军事区以南附近的李伪军部队时，更露骨地叫嚣说，“我已准备命令你们向北进军。”据路透社报道，李承晚将在这个星期内与已从日内瓦回到汉城的新任命的国务总理卞荣泰和最近被召回汉城的南朝鲜驻联合国观察员林炳稷举行会议，制定发动新的挑衅的“行动计划”。据李匪帮的高级官员透露，“南朝鲜将及早采取具体的步骤以有力地说明它已经废除了朝鲜军事停战协定。”这些人还透露，“第一个行动可能是要求联合国军司令部把所有中立国的停战视察小组都赶出南朝鲜。”美国指使李承晚策划这个行动，显然是企图取消中立国监察委员会，摆脱中立国视察和监察的约束，以便它无所顾忌地进行种种破坏行动。
    同时，李承晚集团正在加紧扩充傀儡军队，为发动新的冒险进行准备。南朝鲜陆军参谋长丁一权在最近公开宣布，李承晚集团已经拟订完成了一项建立庞大的后备队的计划。第一批包括十八万七千名官兵的后备队将在七月一日成立。李承晚最近又与到远东来进行侵略部署的前侵朝美军第八军军长范佛里特进行了紧张的会谈，要求美国大力扩充李伪军的地面部队，建立一支配备有喷气式飞机的空军和一支配备有巡洋舰和潜水艇的海军，并增加美国对南朝鲜的军事“援助”。
    十分明显，李承晚集团正在策划的挑衅阴谋，是受到美国的指使的。在中印两国总理和中缅两国总理分别发表了联合声明之后，亚洲各国人民正在欢欣鼓舞地为保障亚洲的和平与安全而努力。美国的阴谋正是与全亚洲人民为敌。如果它敢于进行冒险，它必然遭受更大的失败。
