    Guangzhou People's Water Sports Are Exceptionally Active
    Since the beginning of summer, water sports have been exceptionally active among the people of Guangzhou. The four swimming pools in Liwan, Western Suburbs, Yuexiu Mountain, and Shamian opened on "May Day," and in May and June, more than 366,000 people visited them. The swimming pools are even more bustling on Sundays and holidays. In the Lychee Bay leading to the large-scale Liwan People's Swimming Pool, small boats carrying swimmers were connected end to end, forming a line more than one mile long. On July 18th, the Liwan People's Swimming Pool alone had more than 22,000 people swimming there. Public swimming pools hold swimming competitions almost every week. In June alone, 75 units, including 34 organizations such as the Construction Workers' Union and the Postal and Telecommunications Workers' Union, and 16 schools, held 31 swimming competitions, with 2,200 athletes participating. The Guangzhou City-wide Workers' Swimming Competition was also held on July 10th and 11th, with 242 athletes from 34 units participating.
    This year, the Guangzhou Municipal People's Government Sports Commission, in order to promote the development of water sports, has held training classes for worker swimming instructors, worker early morning swimming training classes, and water polo training classes, and has also built four public swimming pools. The Yuexiu Mountain Swimming Pool has become even more beautiful after renovation. The Liwan People's Swimming Pool has added two more swimming pools this year, and now the swimming pool can accommodate 6,000 swimmers at the same time.

    广州人民的水上运动异常活跃
    入夏以来，广州人民的水上运动异常活跃。荔湾、西郊、越秀山和沙面四个游泳场从“五一”开放后，在五、六两个月中，去游泳的人有三十六万六千多人次。星期天和假日，各游泳场更是热闹。在通往规模很大的荔湾人民游泳场的荔枝湾里，载运游泳者的小艇首尾相接，排成了一里多长的行列。在七月十八日这一天荔湾人民游泳场就有两万两千多人在那里游泳。公共游泳场所几乎每星期都有游泳比赛活动。仅六月份，就有建筑工会、邮电工会等三十四个机关、十六个学校等七十五个单位，共举行了三十一次游泳比赛，参加比赛的运动员达二千二百多人。广州市全市工人游泳比赛也在七月十日到十一日举行，有三十四个单位的二百四十二个运动员参加。
    今年，广州市人民政府体育运动委员会为了推动水上体育活动的开展，举办了工人游泳辅导员训练班、工人早泳训练班和水球训练班等，还修建了四个公共游泳场。越秀山游泳场经过修饰后，更加美丽了。荔湾人民游泳场今年又增辟了两个游泳池，现在这个游泳场已可同时容纳六千个游泳者。
