Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, July 13th: Over sixty thousand mutual aid teams in the Northeast region (incomplete statistics) have applied to establish agricultural production cooperatives after the autumn harvest. In Liaodong and Liaoxi provinces, 23,000 mutual aid teams have requested to establish cooperatives after the autumn harvest. During the spring plowing and sowing season this year, these mutual aid teams saw that agricultural production cooperatives had higher manure piles and more meticulous cultivation. Now, they see that the crops sown using new-style farm implements and new cultivation methods are growing better than those of the mutual aid teams. As a result, the number of mutual aid teams requesting to establish cooperatives is constantly increasing.

These mutual aid teams that want to establish cooperatives are actively learning production techniques from agricultural production cooperatives and improving their own techniques. Many mutual aid teams preparing to establish cooperatives have also established production management committees to learn collective management as soon as possible. They have implemented "small-scale contracting," made short-term production plans, implemented division of labor according to technical expertise, and improved the work evaluation and point-recording system. Some mutual aid teams collectively plant pasture grass for future collective horse-feeding; some also collectively reclaim wasteland, accumulate manure fertilizer, and buy carts, horses, and farm implements.

Party and government leading organs in various regions are responding to the farmers' demands by actively preparing for the establishment of cooperatives after the autumn harvest, in conjunction with the current central tasks in rural areas. In many places, joint meetings of core members of mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives are held to cultivate those who will establish cooperatives after the autumn harvest, or the experience in production and rational organization of labor is exchanged through mutual aid and cooperation networks, and other methods are used to consolidate the mutual aid teams. Many county-level leading organs have specifically analyzed and studied the new situation of the local mutual aid and cooperation movement and have made arrangements for the establishment of cooperatives after the autumn harvest according to the instructions of higher authorities. Many counties in Liaoxi Province have rectified a considerable number of weak village-level Party branches. Under the leadership of the local Party committee, the Bai Cheng County Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League in Heilongjiang Province is preparing to systematically train accountants and production team leaders needed for the establishment of cooperatives after the autumn harvest from rural youths and rural middle and primary school graduates.

Rural work cadres in various regions, especially county and district cadres, are stepping up their efforts to learn and summarize cooperative management experience, and are passing on the methods and experience of cooperative management to village cadres, Party members, and Youth League members through training courses, mutual aid and cooperation networks, and other forms, in order to solve the difficulty of insufficient cadre strength.

　　
This newspaper, Chongqing, July 12th: The mutual aid and cooperation movement in the Southwest region has made great progress in the first half of this year. Approximately over 12 million peasant households throughout the region have participated in mutual aid and cooperative organizations, with the organized households accounting for nearly 60 percent of the total number of peasant households. In areas with a relatively solid foundation for mutual aid and cooperation, the organized households have reached 80 to 90 percent. There are currently 1,489 agricultural production cooperatives in the region. Under the influence of establishing cooperatives, mutual aid teams have made great progress and improvement. Some areas in Sichuan Province use the method of establishing mutual aid and cooperation networks to drive various types of mutual aid teams at all levels. Yunnan Province universally uses mutual aid and cooperation representative conferences, organized visits, and other methods to drive mutual aid teams. Currently, there are more than 3,000 year-round mutual aid teams, an increase of more than five times compared with the end of last year. By the end of April, the seven counties in the Ya'an Special District of Xikang Province had newly developed 1,589 mutual aid teams, of which 601 had been cultivated and improved to become year-round mutual aid teams. In the Zunyi Special District of Guizhou Province, the organized households have reached 65 percent of the total number of peasant households, and the number of year-round mutual aid teams has increased by more than two times compared to last winter. Among the 220,000 year-round mutual aid teams in Sichuan Province, more than 18,000 are preparing to establish cooperatives. Currently, various regions are continuing to consolidate and improve mutual aid and cooperative organizations in conjunction with summer production activities.

    东北六万多个互助组申请建立农业合作社
    西南发展提高互助组准备办农业社的条件
    【新华社沈阳十三日电】东北区已有六万多个互助组（不完全统计）申请秋后建立农业生产合作社。辽东、辽西两省要求秋后建社的互助组有两万三千个。由于这些互助组在今年备耕和播种期间，看到了农业生产合作社粪堆高、耕作细致，现在又看到使用新式农具和新耕作法播种的作物比互助组长得好，因而要求建社的互助组不断增加。
    这些要求建社的互助组积极向农业生产合作社学习改进生产技术。许多准备建社的互助组，为了及早学会集体经营，还成立了生产管理委员会，实行了“小包工”，订了小段生产计划，按技术专长实行分工分业，并改进了评工记分制度。有些互助组集体种植了牧草以便将来集体喂马；有的还集体开荒地、积粪肥、买车马农具。
    各地党政领导机关针对农民这种要求，结合当前农村中心工作，积极进行秋后建社准备工作。很多地方为了培养秋后建社对象，召开了互助组和农业生产合作社骨干分子联席会议，或者是通过互助合作网交流生产和合理组织劳动力方面的经验，以及其他等等办法来巩固互助组。许许多多的县一级领导机关，具体地分析和研究了当地互助合作运动的新情况，并根据上级的指示进行了秋后建社的部署。辽西省不少县整顿了相当数量的薄弱村中共支部。中国新民主主义青年团黑龙江省白城县委员会，在当地党委领导下，准备有计划地从农村青年和农村中、小学毕业生中培养和训练出秋后建社需要的会计和生产队长。
    各地农村工作干部，特别是县、区干部，正加紧学习和总结办社经验，并通过办训练班、互助合作网等形式，把办社的办法、经验传授给村干部、党员、团员，以便解决干部力量不足的困难。
    【本报重庆十二日电】西南区互助合作运动今年上半年有了很大发展。全区约已有一千二百多万户农民参加了互助合作组织，组织起来的农户将近总农户的百分之六十，互助合作较有基础的地区，组织起来的农户已达百分之八十至九十。全区现已有一千四百八十九个农业生产合作社。各地在办社影响下，互助组有了很大发展和提高。四川省有些地区用建立互助合作网的办法，层层带动各种类型的互助组。云南省普遍运用互助合作代表会议组织参观等方式带动互助组，现已有三千多个常年互助组，比去年年底时增加了五倍多。西康省雅安专区七个县到四月底止，新发展了一千五百八十九个互助组，其中有六百零一个经过培养提高成为常年互助组。贵州省遵义专区组织起来的农户已达总农户的百分之六十五，常年互助组比去冬增加两倍多。四川省二十二万个常年互助组中已有一万八千多个准备建社。现各地正结合夏季生产活动，继续进行互助合作组织的巩固提高工作。
