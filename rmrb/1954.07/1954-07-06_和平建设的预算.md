    Budget for Peaceful Construction
    Geng Hanbin

    Our country's 1954 national budget fully reflects the aspirations of our people to carry out peaceful economic and cultural construction. It marks the further prosperity and growth of our economic and cultural construction undertakings this year.

    I

    Based on the overall tasks of the state during the transition period and the requirements of national economic development, as well as the continued strengthening of national defense and further improvement of the material and cultural lives of the working people on the basis of developing production, the 1954 national budget stipulates that the total expenditure for economic construction, social and cultural education, national defense, and administrative management will be 24,945.78 billion yuan. If the total expenditure in 1952 is taken as 100, then it will be 152.84 in 1954.

      From the above figures, it can be seen that the growth of our country's total national budget expenditure is rapid, with the growth of expenditures in economic construction and social and cultural education occupying a particularly priority position. If the economic construction expenditure in 1952 is taken as 100, then it will be 154.96 in 1954; if the social and cultural education expenditure in 1952 is taken as 100, then it will be 164.3 in 1954.

    The economic construction expenditure and social and cultural education expenditure in the national budget not only have rapid growth rates, but also the proportion they occupy in the budget expenditure increases year by year. Conversely, the proportion of national defense expenditure and administrative management expenditure in the budget decreases year by year. For example, economic construction expenditure accounted for 44.34 percent of the total expenditure in 1953 (original budget number for 1953), while it increased to 45.39 percent in 1954; while national defense expenditure accounted for 22.38 percent of the total expenditure in 1953 (original budget number for 1953), it decreased to 21.11 percent in 1954.

      The increasingly large expenditure figures in our country's 1954 national budget, especially the rapid growth of economic construction and social and cultural education expenditure, prominently illustrate that our country in the past, at present, and in the future will continue to concentrate its main efforts on peaceful economic and cultural construction, and illustrate that the national budget uses a large amount of funds to ensure the needs of our country's peaceful economic and cultural construction. For example, the economic construction expenditure in 1954 is the largest in history, with the huge amount reaching over 100 trillion yuan, equivalent to six and a half times that of 1950. The social and cultural education expenditure in 1954 increased by 15.2 percent compared to 1953, and is more than the total of social and cultural education expenditure in 1951 and 1952 combined. Of course, while we are engaged in peaceful economic and cultural construction, we will never forget to strengthen our country's national defense. Because the warmongering elements of American imperialism are still attempting to launch new wars of aggression and are still adopting policies that are hostile to our country, threatening our country's security.

    II

    Our country's national budget allocating large amounts of funds for economic construction expenditure fully demonstrates the characteristics and superiority of our national budget.

    Our country is gradually transitioning to a socialist society. Therefore, the task of economic construction expenditure in the national budget is to fully develop our country's national economy, especially the socialist economy, in accordance with the laws of planned and proportionate development of the national economy, and in all aspects to meet the requirements of the basic socialist economic laws, in order to establish a material and technical foundation for our country's socialist society. It should also determine different investment amounts between various sectors of the national economy—that is, between industry, agriculture, transportation, and commerce, and within industry, between heavy industry and light industry—according to appropriate proportions.

    Based on the national economic plan, our country's national budget, at the current stage, in accordance with the basic tasks of our country's first Five-Year Plan, should first concentrate large amounts of funds on the development of heavy industry, in order to ensure the smooth realization of national socialist industrialization, and in order to promote the continuous growth and improvement of our country's production on a high technical basis, because heavy industry is the foundation of the foundation for developing our country's national economy and strengthening our country's national defense, and is the foundation for our people to live a happy life.

    The budget also allocates certain funds for transportation, light industry, agriculture, and commerce, in order to ensure their corresponding development. Because these departments are responsible for meeting the needs of the people, accumulating construction funds, and coordinating the reproduction of the entire society, each of which is indispensable to socialist economic life and also indispensable to the development of heavy industry. Only in this way can we ensure that our country's planned economic construction can proceed smoothly.

    The 1954 national budget allocates 11,322.7 billion yuan for economic construction expenditure, accounting for 45.39 percent of the total national budget expenditure. In this part of the expenditure, the appropriation for the industrial sector is 5,412.18 billion yuan, accounting for 47.8 percent of the economic construction expenditure; the appropriation for agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, etc. is 1,194.29 billion yuan, accounting for 10.55 percent; the appropriation for railways, transportation, postal services, and telecommunications is 1,764.93 billion yuan, accounting for 15.59 percent; the appropriation for commerce, foreign trade, grain, etc. is 1,279.07 billion yuan, accounting for 11.29 percent; the investment in joint state-private enterprises is 250 billion yuan, accounting for 2.2 percent.

    From the above figures, it can be clearly seen that the appropriation for economic construction in the 1954 national budget is huge, and nearly one-half of the economic construction appropriation is concentrated on industry, especially the appropriation for heavy industry, accounting for 78.3 percent of the entire industrial appropriation, while light industry accounts for 21.7 percent. In this way, the priority growth of heavy industry production—the production of means of production—is ensured. Of course, a considerable amount of funds has also been allocated to other sectors of the national economy in order to promote their corresponding development.

    As a result of the huge economic construction appropriation in 1954, especially the concentration of the vast majority of funds on basic construction investment, hundreds of major construction projects will be newly built and expanded this year, and dozens of newly built and expanded factories and mines will be put into production this year. These include coal mines, power plants, oil mines, steel plants, non-ferrous metal mines, machinery factories, textile factories, paper mills, etc. The commissioning of these factories and mines will make it possible to further increase industrial production and further meet the needs of national construction and the people's production and life. The total output value of the country's modern industry will increase by 18.3 percent in 1954 compared to 1953, and the total output value of industry and agriculture will increase by 12.6 percent in 1954 compared to 1953.

    As production increases, the lives of the working people will be further improved. In 1954, the average wage of employees in state-owned enterprises, cultural and educational departments, and state organs will increase by 5.2 percent compared to 1953, and social purchasing power will increase by 13.8 percent compared to 1953.

    While the state is carrying out large-scale economic construction, it is also correspondingly developing social and cultural education. This is also one of the most important aspects of socialist construction. Comrade Stalin once pointed out: "Socialism can only be built on the basis of the vigorous development of socialist productive forces, on the basis of an abundance of agricultural and industrial products, on the basis of the affluence of the lives of the laborers, and on the basis of the surging growth of cultural standards." (Stalin: Problems of Leninism, Moscow Chinese Edition, p. 628.)

    However, at the current stage, when the state must concentrate its main efforts on the development of production, the development of cultural and educational undertakings can only be gradually developed according to a certain plan and a certain proportion. Because only when production develops can the development of cultural and educational undertakings obtain the necessary material foundation.

    The 1954 national budget allocates 366.92 billion yuan for social and cultural education expenditure (excluding social labor insurance premiums), accounting for 14.71 percent of the total national budget expenditure, of which 279.048 billion yuan is used for culture, education, and health expenditures, and 46.578 billion yuan is used for social relief and preferential treatment expenditures. Due to the large amount of appropriations from the national budget in this regard, our country's cultural and educational undertakings will be further developed in 1954. For example, in 1954, higher education institutions plan to enroll 90,505 students, an increase of 13,988 students compared to the previous year. Secondary technical schools and worker-peasant accelerated middle schools will enroll 127,130 students, an increase of 24,535 students compared to the previous year. Ordinary middle schools, both senior and junior, will enroll a total of 1,349,650 students, an increase of 353,476 students compared to the previous year. The number of hospital beds will reach 207,533, an increase of 16,468 beds compared to the previous year.

    The state concentrates its main efforts on economic construction, and still uses such a huge amount of funds for the development of cultural and educational undertakings, which clearly shows that our country pays great attention and concern to the improvement of the material and cultural lives of the broad masses of the people, and also shows that our country's budget is a budget for increasing the welfare of the people.

    For several years, the people of our country have clearly known the fact that the smooth progress of national construction must be guaranteed by a consolidated national defense. Therefore, in order to defend the security of our motherland, defend the peaceful and constructive labor of our people, and defend peace in the Far East and the world, while carrying out peaceful economic and cultural construction, it is absolutely necessary for the national budget to stipulate a certain amount of national defense expenditure, especially in the current situation where the warmongering elements of American imperialism are frantically clamoring for a new war of aggression. This expenditure has special and important significance.

      The 1954 national budget allocates 526.7 billion yuan for national defense expenditure, accounting for 21.11 percent of the total expenditure, which is lower than in 1953.

    III

    The above-mentioned distinct characteristics of our country's national budget fundamentally distinguish it from the budgets of capitalist countries. In the current stage of imperialism, in order to ensure the maximum profits of monopoly capitalism, in order to realize its suppression of the working people, and in order to expand its territory by relying on predatory wars of aggression to plunder the territory of other countries, the expenses directly and indirectly used for expanding armaments and preparing for war account for the vast majority of budget expenditures in its budget. For example, the direct military expenditure of the United States in 1953-54 accounted for 73 percent of the entire national budget expenditure, that is, for every three US dollars spent by the government, more than two US dollars were used for military purposes. And most of the military expenditure is used to expand military bases in foreign territories and establish new military bases, as well as to manufacture large-scale weapons of mass destruction. Today, the United States has established military bases in the territories of 49 countries, and has stationed as many as 2,000,000 American soldiers and military personnel in 27 countries. (Vyshinsky: "Measures Concerning the Elimination of the Threat of Another World War and the Relaxation of International Tensions" - Speech at the Plenary Meeting of the Eighth Session of the United Nations General Assembly on September 21, 1953) And in the same period, the US budget for so-called "social insurance, welfare and health costs" is negligible, according to official US figures, accounting for only 3.1 percent of budget expenditures, and expenditures on education and general research are even more pitiful, accounting for only a little more than 0.3 percent of total expenditures, approximately equal to two-hundredths of military expenditures.

    This clearly tells us that the budget of a capitalist country completely serves the interests of the monopoly capitalists and is hostile to the interests of the working people. It is a tool for capitalist countries to expand armaments and prepare for war, carry out aggressive policies, and undermine world peace in order to achieve the maximum profits of monopoly capitalism.

    In our country's 1954 national budget expenditure, more than 60 percent of the funds are used for peaceful economic and cultural construction. This fact vividly and prominently illustrates that our country's national budget is completely contrary to the military budget of capitalist countries. It is a budget for peaceful economic and cultural construction and completely serves the interests of our people.

    The approval and promulgation of the 1954 national budget not only makes the people of our country engaged in peaceful constructive labor jubilant and confident, and under the brilliant illumination of the country's general tasks, strive to fully complete and over fulfill the 1954 national economic plan, and strive to achieve greater victories in the country's socialist construction. At the same time, it will be warmly welcomed by peace-loving people all over the world, and will inspire and strengthen their confidence in fighting to defend world peace, in order to strive to make more and greater contributions in the cause of defending world peace.

    和平建设的预算
    耿汉斌
    我国一九五四年度的国家预算充分反映了我国人民进行和平的经济建设与文化建设的愿望，它标志着我国的经济与文化建设事业在今年将进一步的繁荣与增长。
    一
    一九五四年国家预算根据国家在过渡时期的总任务和国民经济发展的要求，以及继续加强国防力量，和在发展生产的基础上进一步改善劳动人民的物质和文化生活，规定用于经济建设、社会文教、国防、行政管理等方面的支出总额为二、四九四、五七八亿元。如果以一九五二年的支出总额为一○○，一九五四年则为一五二点八四。
      从上面的数字可以看出，我国国家预算支出总额的增长是迅速的，其中特别占优先地位的是经济建设与社会文教事业方面支出的增长。如果以一九五二年经济建设支出为一○○，一九五四年为一五四点九六；如果以一九五二年的社会文教支出为一○○，一九五四年为一六四点三。
    国家预算中的经济建设支出和社会文教支出不仅增长率迅速，同时，占预算支出的比重也逐年增加。相反地，国防支出和行政管理支出在预算中所占的比重则在逐年降低。如一九五三年经济建设支出为支出总额的百分之四四点三四（一九五三年原预算数），一九五四年则增加为百分之四五点三九；而国防支出在一九五三年为支出总额的百分之二二点三八（一九五三年原预算数），一九五四年降低为二一点一一。
      一九五四年我国国家预算日益增长的支出数字，特别是经济建设和社会文教支出急剧增长的数字，突出地说明了我们的国家过去是，现在是，将来仍旧是集中主要力量进行和平的经济建设与文化建设，说明了国家预算是把大量资金用来保证我国的和平经济建设与文化建设的需要。比如：一九五四年的经济建设支出是历年来最多的一年，数额之巨达到一百多万亿元以上，相当于一九五○年的六倍半。一九五四年的社会文教支出比一九五三年增加了百分之一五点二，比一九五一年和一九五二年两年社会文教支出的总额还多。当然，在我们从事和平经济建设和文化建设的同时，我们时刻也不会忘记增强我国的国防力量。因为美帝国主义好战分子今天仍在企图发动新的侵略战争，仍在采取敌视我国的政策，威胁我国的安全。
    二
    我国国家预算把大量资金用于经济建设支出上，充分表明了我们国家预算的特点及其优越性。
    我们的国家正在一步一步地过渡到社会主义社会。因此，国家预算中经济建设支出的任务，就在于充分地依照国民经济有计划按比例发展的法则，及在各方面符合社会主义基本经济法则的要求，来发展我国国民经济，特别是社会主义经济，为我国社会主义社会建立物质技术基础。并且还应当在国民经济各部门之间——即工业、农业、交通运输业与商业之间，以及在工业内部各生产部门之间——重工业与轻工业之间，按照适当比例确定不同的投资数额。
    以国民经济计划为基础的我国国家预算，在目前阶段，依照我国第一个五年建设计划的基本任务，首先应集中大量资金用于重工业的发展上，以便保证国家社会主义工业化的顺利实现，以便促进我国的生产不断地在高度技术基础上得以增长和完善，因为重工业乃是发展我国国民经济和加强我国国防力量的基础的基础，是我国人民过幸福生活的基础。
    对于交通运输业、轻工业、农业和商业，预算也拨付了一定的资金，以便保证其相应的发展。因为这些部门担负着满足人民需要，积累建设资金和配合整个社会进行再生产的任务，其中每一个部门都是社会主义经济生活所不可缺少的，也是发展重工业所不能缺少的，只有这样，才能保证我国有计划的经济建设能够顺利的进行。
    一九五四年国家预算用于经济建设支出为一、一三二、二七○亿元，占国家预算总支出的百分之四五点三九。在这一部分支出中，工业部门的拨款为五四一、二一八亿元，占经济建设支出的百分之四七点八，农业、林业、水利事业等的拨款为一一九、四二九亿元，占百分之一○点五五，铁道、交通、邮电等的拨款为一七六、四九三亿元，占百分之一五点五九，商业、对外贸易、粮食等的拨款为一二七、九○七亿元，占百分之一一点二九，公私合营企业的投资为二五、○○○亿元，占百分之二点二。
    从上面的数字清楚地看出，一九五四年国家预算在经济建设上的拨款是巨大的，并且是集中了将近二分之一的经济建设拨款用于工业上，特别是用于重工业的拨款，占整个工业拨款的百分之七八点三，轻工业占百分之二一点七。这样，就保证了重工业生产——生产资料生产的优先增长。当然，对国民经济其他部门也拨付了相当数量的资金，以便促进其相应的发展。
    由于一九五四年巨额的经济建设拨款，特别是集中绝大部分资金用于基本建设投资上的结果，就使得今年国家新建和扩建的重大建设项目有数百个，将有数十个新建和扩建完成了的工厂、矿山投入本年度生产。其中包括有煤矿、发电厂、油矿，钢铁厂，有色金属矿，机器厂、纺织厂，造纸厂等等。这些工厂、矿山的投入生产，就有可能使工业生产进一步提高，进一步满足国家建设和人民群众在生产上，生活上的需要，一九五四年全国现代工业的总产值将比一九五三年增长百分之一八点三，工农业总产值将比一九五三年增长百分之一二点六。
    由于生产的提高，劳动人民的生活将要得到进一步的改善，一九五四年国营企业职工、文化教育部门和国家机关工作人员的平均工资将比一九五三年提高百分之五点二，社会购买力将比一九五三年提高百分之一三点八。
    国家在进行大规模经济建设的同时，也相应地发展了社会文化教育事业。这也是社会主义建设的最主要方面之一。斯大林同志曾指出：“社会主义只有在社会主义生产力蓬勃发展的基础上，在农产品和工业品丰盈的基础上，在劳动者生活丰裕的基础上，在文化水准汹涌升长的基础上，才可建成。”（斯大林著：列宁主义问题，莫斯科中文版，第六二八页。）
    但是在目前阶段，在国家必须集中主要力量用于生产的发展上，文化教育事业只能按照一定的计划，一定的比例作到逐步的发展。因为，只有生产发展了，文化教育事业的发展才获得了必要的物质基础。
    一九五四年国家预算用于社会文教的支出为三六六、九二○亿元（社会劳动保险费不计算在内），占国家预算总支出的百分之一四点七一，其中用于文化、教育、卫生支出为二七九、○四八亿元；用于社会救济和优抚支出为四六、五七八亿元。由于国家预算在这方面的大量拨款，一九五四年我国的文教事业将要得到进一步的发展。例如：一九五四年高等学校计划招生九○、五○五人，比上年增加一三、九八八人，中等技术学校和工农速成中学招生一二七、一三○人，比上年增加二四、五三五人，普通中学高初中共招生一、三四九、六五○人，比上年增加三五三、四七六人，病床数将达到二○七、五三三张，比上年增加一六、四六八张。
    国家在集中主要力量进行经济建设的情况下，还以如此巨额的资金用于文教事业的发展，这就清楚的说明了我们的国家对于广大人民群众的物质文化生活的改善，是给与了很大的注意和关怀，并且也说明了我国的预算乃是增进人民福利的预算。
    几年来，我国人民清楚地知道这样一个事实：国家建设的顺利进行，必须要有巩固的国防来保证。因此，为了保卫我们祖国的安全，保卫我国人民的和平的建设性的劳动以及保卫远东和世界和平，在进行和平的经济建设和文化建设的同时，国家预算规定一定数额的国防支出是完全必要的，特别是在目前美帝国主义好战分子在疯狂叫嚣新的侵略战争的情况下，这一笔支出就更具有了特殊的重大意义。
      一九五四年国家预算用于国防支出为五二六、七○○亿元，占总支出的百分之二一点一一，比一九五三年降低了。
    三
    上述我国国家预算的鲜明特点，它是根本区别于资本主义国家的预算的。在目前帝国主义阶段，资本主义国家为了保证垄断资本主义的最大限度的利润，为了实现其镇压劳动人民，并为了靠掠夺性的侵略战争，侵略其他国家的领土来扩大本国领土，因此，在其预算中，直接和间接用于扩军备战的费用占预算支出的绝大部分。如美国一九五三——五四年的直接军费支出占整个国家的预算支出的百分之七三，即政府每用三块美元，其中即有二块多美元用于军事目的上去。而军费支出的大部分则是用于扩大在外国领土上的军事基地和建立新的军事基地以及用于制造大规模的杀人武器。美国今天在四十九个国家的领土上建立了军事基地，在二十七个国家中驻扎着数达二、○○○、○○○名的美国士兵和军事人员。（维辛斯基：“关于消除另一次世界大战的威胁和缓和国际紧张局势的措施”——一九五三年九月二十一日在联合国第八届大会全体会议上的演说）而在同一时期，美国预算用于所谓“社会保险、福利和卫生费”是微乎其微的，依照美国官方发表的数字，仅仅占到预算支出的百分之三点一，教育和一般研究支出少的更可怜，只占总支出的百分之○点三强，约等于军费支出的二百分之一。
    这就清楚地告诉我们，资本主义国家的预算，是完全服务于垄断资本家的利益，并且是与劳动人民利益相敌对的，它是资本主义国家扩军备战、进行侵略政策、破坏世界和平以达到垄断资本主义获取最大限度利润的工具。
    我国一九五四年的国家预算支出中，百分之六○以上的资金是用于和平的经济建设与文化建设上去，这一事实，就生动而突出的说明了我国的国家预算与资本主义国家军事性预算完全相反，是和平的经济建设与文化建设的预算，是完全服务于我国人民利益的。
    一九五四年国家预算的批准和公布，不仅使得我国从事和平建设性的劳动人民欢欣鼓舞，信心百倍地在国家总任务的光辉照耀下，为全面地完成和超额完成一九五四年的国民经济计划、为争取在国家的社会主义建设中取得更大胜利而努力。同时，它将得到全世界爱好和平的人民的热烈欢迎，并将鼓舞和坚定他们为保卫世界和平而斗争的信心，以便争取在保卫世界和平的事业中作出更多的更大的贡献。
