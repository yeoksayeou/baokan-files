Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, 3rd dispatch: According to Tass, about 15,000 workers in Damascus recently held a strike. Workers at a textile company first announced the strike after the factory refused to meet the workers' demands. In solidarity with them, workers from one of Syria's largest companies, as well as transportation workers, construction workers, textile workers, metal workers, machinists, and rubber industry workers, joined the strike. Buses in Damascus were out of service for three days.

The striking workers demanded a 25 percent wage increase, guarantees of labor protection, an end to unwarranted dismissals, guaranteed free medical care, the establishment of an eight-hour workday, and recognition of workers' right to join trade unions.

On June 30, striking workers held a demonstration march in Damascus under the slogan of supporting workers in all industries who are fighting for their rights.

The mass strike prompted the Syrian government to step in as an intermediary in negotiations between worker representatives and company representatives. After negotiations, some company authorities made concessions and met some of the strikers' demands, including: setting minimum wage levels; recognizing workers' right to join trade unions; reinstating dismissed workers; guaranteeing free medical care and payment of wages for the duration of the strike; and promising to review the issue of wage increases. Workers at the "Hhomashi Textile Company" and bus workers agreed to return to work on this basis. However, construction workers, Damascus textile workers, metal workers, machinists, and other workers continue to strike because the various enterprise authorities refuse to meet their demands.

On July 1, the striking workers held another demonstration march. This demonstration was held under the slogan of fighting to meet the workers' demands.

    叙利亚首都工人举行大罢工
    【新华社五日讯】据塔斯社贝鲁特三日讯：最近大马士革约有一万五千工人举行了罢工。一家纺织公司的工人在厂方拒绝满足工人的要求以后首先宣布罢工。为了声援他们，叙利亚一家最大的公司的工人和交通工人、建筑工人、纺织工人、五金工人、机工和橡胶工业工人等都参加了罢工。公共汽车在大马士革停驶了三天。
    罢工工人要求增加工资百分之二十五，保证劳动保护，停止无理的解雇，保证免费诊疗，规定八小时的工作日和承认工人加入工会的权利等。
    六月三十日，罢工工人在声援为自己的权利而斗争的各业工人的口号下，在大马士革举行了示威游行。
    具有群众性质的罢工使得叙利亚政府赶忙出面作工人代表和公司代表之间谈判的中间人。经过谈判，有些公司当局作了让步，而且满足了罢工者的某些要求，其中包括有：规定了最低限度的工资额；承认工人加入工会的权利；被解雇的工人复工；保证免费诊疗和支付罢工期间的工资，还允诺审查关于增加工资的问题。“霍马西阿纺织公司”工人和公共汽车工人在这个基础上同意复工。但是，建筑工人、大马士革纺织工人、五金工人、机工和其他工人仍继续罢工，因为各企业当局拒绝满足他们的要求。
    七月一日，罢工工人再一次举行示威游行。这次示威游行是在为满足工人的要求而斗争的口号下举行的。
