Guangxi's Xijiang, Hepu, and Mingyang State-Owned Mechanical Farms have basically completed their production plans for the first half of the year. Statistics as of June 15 show that the three farms have reclaimed more than 99,700 mu of wasteland, completing over 58% of the annual reclamation plan of 170,000 mu, and have sown a total of over 78,800 mu of various crops.

Currently, the various crops on the three farms are growing well. The germination rate of upland rice on the Xijiang State-Owned Mechanical Farm has reached 100%, with 6 to 8 tillers per plant and a stem height of about 30 centimeters. The directly sown upland rice seedlings are also robust and dark green. Although sugarcane was affected by drought, the germination rate is still 85%. After two to three cultivations, it has grown strong and thick. The corn germination rate reached 94%, and the seedlings are growing well. After cultivation and topdressing, they have turned green. The nearly 20,000 mu of peanuts on the three farms have begun their first flowering, with 8 to 10 roots attached to each plant. If not affected by unexpected disasters, the estimated yield is over 150 jin per mu. The cassava in Hepu and Xijiang farms has sprouted 100% and is growing very well.

Hubei Province has newly built the State-Owned Caobuhu Mechanical Farm at the junction of Zhijiang and Dangyang counties on the north bank of the Yangtze River. Construction began in February this year, and all basic construction is expected to be completed within three years. This is a lake wasteland area of ​​nearly 100,000 mu, which was often flooded decades ago and is now covered with reeds and thatch.

Under the policy of "building the farm while producing," the farm dispatched four tractors to start land reclamation in late April. Before summer planting, 6,000 mu of wasteland will be reclaimed, and 5,500 mu will be planted with soybeans and sorghum, and 500 mu with cotton. In order to complete this urgent task, tractor drivers worked hard even when the ground was muddy after rain. In May, all the staff launched a labor competition, actively carried out land planning, and built drainage ditches. With the enthusiastic help of the local people, more than 40 li of roads have been repaired, and the thatch and reeds on more than 7,000 mu of wasteland have been cut.

The farm plans to reclaim 18,000 mu of wasteland next year to plant wheat, and to complete the reclamation of the wasteland within the year after next, planting all of it with grain and cotton. (Xiang Yi)

    广西省合浦等机械农场开荒近十万亩
    播种的七万多亩旱稻等作物生长良好
    湖北省新建国营草埠湖机械农场开始垦荒
    广西省西江、合浦、明阳三个国营机械农场，已基本完成上半年生产计划。截至六月十五日的统计，三个场已开荒九万九千七百多亩，完成全年开荒十七万亩计划的百分之五十八以上，并已播种了各种作物共七万八千八百多亩。
    目前，三个农场的各种作物生长很好。国营西江机械农场的旱稻出苗率达百分之百，已分蘖六至八根，茎高已达三十公分左右；旱直播的水稻幼苗也茁壮，呈深绿色；甘蔗虽因受天旱影响，发芽率亦达百分之八十五，经过中耕两次到三次后，已生长粗壮；玉米出苗率达百分之九十四，幼苗生长良好，经中耕、追肥后已转青。三个场近两万亩的花生已开第一遍花，每单株扎下的根已有八至十根，如不受意外灾害，估计每亩产量在一百五十斤以上。合浦、西江两个场的木薯都百分之百的发芽，且生长很好。

    湖北省在长江北岸枝江和当阳两县交界的地方，新建了国营草埠湖机械农场。建场工作从今年二月开始，全部基本建设预计在三年内完成。这里是一块将近十万亩的湖荒地带，几十年前常遭水淹，现在遍地都是芦苇和茅草。
    在“边建场、边生产”的方针下，从四月下旬起，该场便出动四台拖拉机开始垦荒，夏种前将垦出荒地六千亩，种上五千五百亩黄豆、高粱和五百亩棉花。为了完成这个紧迫任务，拖拉机驾驶员们在阴雨后满地泥泞的情况下，也紧张地进行工作。全场职工在五月间也展开了劳动竞赛，积极进行土地规划，修筑排水渠等工作。另在当地群众的热情帮助下，先后已修好四十多里公路，砍完七千多亩荒地的茅草和芦苇。
    该场计划在明年要开出一万八千亩荒地种植小麦，后年内把荒地开垦完毕，全部种上粮食和棉花。　（向毅）
