    International Opinion Praises Sino-Indian, Sino-Burmese Premier Meetings
    Unanimously Believing They Strengthened the Forces of Peace in Asia

    India
    Delhi newspapers on the 1st all published the joint statement of the Chinese and Burmese Premiers.
    "Statesman" reported on the 1st, regarding Delhi's reaction to the joint statement of the Chinese and Burmese Premiers: "The joint statement of the Chinese and Burmese Premiers, extending the application of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence to new regions, has evoked a completely satisfactory response in New Delhi. Mr. Zhou Enlai's meeting with Mr. U Nu in Rangoon has clearly achieved the same success as his previous meeting with Nehru."

    Indonesia
    Jakarta newspapers have reported on the news of the meetings between Premier Zhou Enlai and the Prime Ministers of India and Burma, and in emphasizing the significance of these meetings, pointed out the possibility of strengthening the unity of Asian countries and striving for peace and the security of all nations.
    "Sin Po" said that the talks between Premier Zhou Enlai and the Prime Ministers of India and Burma "are of great significance not only to India, Burma, and China, but also to the whole world." "Sin Po" added that Indonesia has "expressed its satisfaction with the talks between Zhou Enlai and Nehru through its Foreign Minister Sunario."
    "Sin Po" continued, "We believe that the mutual understanding between China and India in resolving Asian disputes will be of great benefit to Indonesia and other countries... The era in which Asian problems were solved without the participation of the Asian people is gone forever. Asian countries demand peace, prosperity, and progress in culture and other aspects. This is the main spirit of Zhou Enlai's talks in India and Burma."
    "Indonesia News," "Merdeka," "Abadi," and "Indonesia Torch" and other newspapers published dispatches from Delhi and Rangoon, saying that the talks between Zhou Enlai and the Prime Ministers of India and Burma would make a great contribution to peace and the security of all nations.

    German Democratic Republic
    The Berlin "Neues Deutschland" editorial on June 30 wrote: "The content of the joint statement has attracted special attention worldwide. Peace-loving people consider this one of the greatest achievements of their ongoing efforts to unite all forces against instigators of new wars."
    The Berlin "Daily Review" commented in an article published on June 30: "There is no doubt that the talks between Zhou Enlai and Nehru are an important step in further strengthening the friendly relations between the two countries. The fact that two large countries like India and China, with nearly one billion people, have established relations seeking common methods to build peace in Asia and the world, is of extremely important significance. The talks between Zhou Enlai and Nehru have received enthusiastic support from the people of all countries, because their only goal is to consolidate peace in Asia. This goal is in the interests of all peace-loving people."

    Poland
    Warsaw's "Trybuna Ludu," under the title "A Visit of Peace and Friendship," published an article by the famous political commentator Zygmunt Broniarek, talking about Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to India. The author pointed out the warm welcome given to Premier Zhou Enlai by the Indian people, saying: "The meeting between Zhou Enlai and Nehru is welcomed by the people of Asian countries and all people around the world who cherish the cause of world peace. Because world opinion can clearly see that the cooperation and friendship between the People's Republic of China and India, two powerful countries in the peace camp, will inevitably promote the easing of tensions in Asia and the world." The author wrote: "The talks between the Premier of the People's Republic of China and the Prime Minister of India demonstrate the strengthening of relations between the two countries, which is a major event of international significance. This shows that different political and economic systems can coexist peacefully if both sides sincerely and honestly strive to maintain peace, and if they respect each other's sovereignty and territorial integrity." The author pointed out: The American ruling group's "entire policy is based on pitting Asian countries against each other, and driving them to kill each other under the slogan of 'Asians fighting Asians'. The Chinese Premier's friendly visit to Delhi, and the exchange of views on the issue of arranging the destiny of the Asian continent without external interference, has severely struck these plans."

    Czechoslovakia
    Prague's "Rude Pravo" editorial on June 30 wrote that the joint statement by the Chinese and Indian Premiers is a powerful call to the world to strengthen peace and peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems. No imperialist conspiracy can stop the growing prevalence of the principle of peaceful coexistence. The editorial concluded by saying that this statement fills every peace-loving people with joy, and shows him the fruits he has gained in the struggle to achieve international friendly relations, encouraging him to further fight for peace, and to thwart the war plans of American monopoly capital.

    France
    In the past few days, French newspapers have published news, commentaries, and editorials about Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to India and Burma, and the joint statement issued by the Chinese and Indian Premiers in prominent positions and with large headlines. Photos of Zhou Enlai wearing the garlands presented to him by the cheering crowds at the Delhi airport, and portraits of Zhou Enlai and Nehru, were printed on the front pages of newspapers.
    The French newspaper "Le Monde" believes that Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to India and Burma is an important step in strengthening the friendship between China, India, and Burma.
    "Combat" said that the Indian people's friendly attitude towards the People's Republic of China "has been expressed in many signs, especially in the comments of newspapers and the enthusiasm of the people, which cannot be achieved by orders."
    "L'Humanité" wrote on June 29: "Premier Zhou Enlai's trip prominently confirms the solidarity of the Asian people in the struggle for peace, regardless of the political systems of the countries, and whatever the differences in their economic and social structures. The declaration of Nehru and Zhou Enlai undoubtedly exposes the American lie that only countries with the same system can have friendly relations."
    French newspapers emphasized the great significance of the joint statement issued by the two Premiers in Delhi on the 28th.
    "Parisien Libéré" wrote on June 29: "The Zhou Enlai-Nehru joint statement carries the color of a true declaration of Asian independence." This newspaper went on to say, "The Sino-Indian agreement in New Delhi marks a decisive turning point in the history of Asian liberation. It will become increasingly difficult to resolve Far Eastern affairs without the full consent of the 'locals'."
    "Le Figaro" believes that "Asian diplomacy seems to have entered a new stage. The fact that the Zhou Enlai-Nehru talks took place at the same time as Eisenhower and Churchill held talks in Washington is of particular significance. Asian countries have thereby indicated that they do not want to see people discussing issues most relevant to them without their participation."
    Parisian newspapers also welcomed and valued the principles proposed by the Chinese and Indian Premiers for resolving the Indochina issue. "L'Humanité" published a large headline on June 29: "Zhou Enlai and Nehru announced: The peaceful settlement of the Indochina issue should aim at creating free, democratic, unified, and independent countries." "Libération's" headline was: "Zhou Enlai and Nehru declared their willingness to coexist peacefully and to quickly establish peace in Indochina." "Combat's" headline was: "Nehru and Zhou Enlai have reached agreement on the principles for achieving peace in Indochina."

    Egypt
    In the past few days, Egyptian newspapers have devoted a lot of space in their international news sections to reporting on the talks between Premier Zhou Enlai and Prime Minister Nehru. The Cairo Observer said that this situation shows Egypt's unusual concern for the Delhi talks.

    Kenya
    In the more distant African region, the news of the talks between the Chinese and Indian Premiers has also aroused widespread attention. The "Chronicle Daily" in Nairobi, the capital of Central African Kenya, commented: "It is the first time in Asian history that the Prime Ministers of two great Eastern countries have studied together the problems facing the Asian people. It is exciting that both Prime Ministers have reiterated their desire to maintain and defend world peace." The newspaper believes that China should be restored to its legitimate seat in the United Nations. It also said: Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to India and Burma "is a pointer to the future development of the situation in Asia."

专栏：

    各国舆论赞扬中印、中缅总理会谈
    一致认为加强了亚洲和平的力量
    印度
    德里各报一日都刊载了中缅两国总理联合声明。
    “政治家报”一日报道德里对中缅两国总理联合声明的反应说：“中缅两国总理联合声明把五项和平原则的应用扩大到新的地区，这个声明在新德里引起了完全满意的反应。周恩来先生在仰光和吴努先生的会晤显然得到了他先前和尼赫鲁先生会晤时所得到的同样的成就。”
    印尼
    雅加达各报纷纷报道关于周恩来总理和印度总理、缅甸总理举行会谈的消息，并在强调这些会谈的意义时指出了加强亚洲国家的团结，为争取和平和各国安全而斗争的可能性。
    “新报”说，周恩来总理与印度总理、缅甸总理的会谈“不但对印度、缅甸和中国，而且对全世界都有重大的意义”。“新报”又说，印度尼西亚已“通过它的外交部部长苏纳约对周恩来和尼赫鲁的会谈表示满意”。
    “新报”接着说，“我们相信，中国和印度间在解决亚洲争端上的相互谅解对印度尼西亚和其他国家将有很大的益处，……没有亚洲各国人民参加解决亚洲问题的时代已一去不返了。亚洲国家要求和平、繁荣和在文化及其他各方面的进步。这就是周恩来在印度和缅甸举行的会谈的主要精神。”
    “印尼新闻报”、“独立报”、“永恒报”和“印尼火炬报”等都刊载了来自德里和仰光的通讯，说周恩来和印度、缅甸的总理的会谈将对和平和各国的安全作出巨大的贡献。
    德意志民主共和国
    柏林“新德意志报”六月三十日的社论写道：“联合声明的内容已引起了全世界的特别注意。爱好和平的人民认为这是他们为团结一切力量反对新战争挑拨者而作的不断努力所取得的最大成就之一。”
    柏林“每日评论报”在六月三十日发表的一篇文章评论说：“毫无疑问，周恩来和尼赫鲁的会谈是进一步加强两国友好关系的一个重要步骤。像印度和中国这两个拥有将近十亿人民的大国，已建立了寻求共同的方法来建立亚洲和全世界的和平的关系，这个事实具有极其重要的意义。周恩来和尼赫鲁的会谈受到各国人民的热烈支持。因为他们的唯一目标是巩固亚洲的和平。这个目标是符合一切爱好和平的人民的利益的。”
    波兰
    华沙“人民论坛报”在“和平和友好的访问”的标题下，刊载了著名政论家泽格蒙特·布朗尼亚雷克的一篇文章，谈到周恩来总理访问印度的情况。作者指出印度人民给予周恩来总理的热烈欢迎，他说：“周恩来和尼赫鲁的会见受到亚洲国家人民以及全世界所有珍视世界和平事业的人民的欢迎。因为世界舆论可以明显看出，和平阵营里的一个强大国家——中华人民共和国和印度的合作和友谊，势必会促使亚洲以及全世界的紧张局势的缓和。”作者写道：“中华人民共和国总理和印度总理的会谈表现了两国关系的加强，这是一件具有重大国际意义的大事。这说明如果双方都真诚地、诚实地为维护和平而努力，如果它们彼此尊重对方的主权和领土完整的话，不同的政治和经济制度是可能和平共处的。”作者指出：美国统治集团的“整个政策的基础是使亚洲国家彼此对立起来，并在‘亚洲人打亚洲人’的口号下驱使他们互相残杀。中国总理对德里的友好访问，以及在不要外界干涉来安排亚洲大陆的命运问题上的交换意见，使这些计划遭到了严重打击”。
    捷克斯洛伐克
    布拉格“红色权利报”六月三十日的社论写道，中印两国总理联合声明是向全世界发出的主张加强和平和不同社会制度的国家和平共处的有力呼声。任何帝国主义的阴谋都不能够阻挡和平共处的原则日益得势。社论最后说，这篇声明使每一个爱好和平的人民充满了喜悦，并向他显示出他自己在争取实现国际友好关系的斗争中所得到的果实，鼓励他进一步为和平、为挫败美国垄断资本的战争计划而斗争。
    法国
    过去几天中的法国各报都用显著地位和大字标题刊载了关于周恩来总理访问印度和缅甸，以及中印两国总理发表联合声明的消息、评论和社论。周恩来戴着在德里机场上欢呼的群众献给他的花环的照片，周恩来和尼赫鲁的肖像都印在报纸的第一版上。
    法国“世界报”认为，周恩来总理访问印度和缅甸是加强中、印、缅三国之间的友谊的一个重要步骤。
    “战斗报”说，印度人民对中华人民共和国的友好态度“已经从很多的迹象中表示出来，特别是从报纸的评论和老百姓的热情当中表现出来，这都不是命令所能做到的。”
    “人道报”六月二十九日写道：“周恩来总理此行突出地证实了亚洲各国人民在为和平而斗争的团结一致，不论各国的政治制度，它们的经济和社会结构有什么不同。尼赫鲁和周恩来的声明无疑地揭穿了说什么只有相同制度的国家才能有友好关系的美国的鬼话。”
    法国报纸强调了两位总理二十八日在德里发表的联合声明的重大意义。
     “巴黎激进新闻”六月二十九日写道：“周恩来—尼赫鲁的联合声明带有一篇真正的亚洲独立宣言的色彩。”这家报纸接着说，“新德里的中印协议标志着亚洲解放史上的一个具有决定意义的转折点。要想在没有‘当地人’的完全同意的情形下来解决远东事务，将越来越困难了。”
      “费加罗报”认为，“亚洲的外交看来已进入一个新阶段。周恩来—尼赫鲁会谈恰恰在艾森豪威尔和邱吉尔在华盛顿举行会谈的同时举行，是有特别意义的。亚洲国家已由此表明，它们不希望看到人们在没有它们参加的情形下来讨论和它们最有关系的问题。”
    巴黎各报也欢迎和重视中印两国总理所提出的解决印度支那问题的各项原则。“人道报”六月二十九日刊登了一个大标题：“周恩来和尼赫鲁宣布：印度支那问题的和平解决应以创造自由、民主、统一和独立的各个国家为目的”。“解放报”的标题是：“周恩来和尼赫鲁声明了他们对和平共处并在印度支那迅速建立和平的意愿”。“战斗报”的标题是：“尼赫鲁和周恩来已就在印度支那实现和平的各项原则取得一致意见”。
      埃及
    在过去几天中，埃及各报国际新闻版以大量篇幅报道周恩来总理和尼赫鲁总理会谈的消息。开罗观察家说，这种情形就说明埃及对德里会谈异常关心。
      怯尼亚
    在更远的非洲地区，中印两国总理会谈的消息也引起了广泛的重视。中非怯尼亚首都内罗毕的
  “纪事日报”评论说：“东方两个伟大国家的总理一起研讨亚洲人民所面临着的问题，在亚洲历史上还是第一次。令人兴奋的是：这两位总理都重申了关于维持和保卫世界和平的愿望。”报纸认为应该恢复中国在联合国的合法地位。它并说：周恩来总理的访问印度和缅甸，“是亚洲未来形势发展的指针”。
