Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, July 22nd: The French Communist Party issued a statement after the signing of the Indochina armistice agreement. The statement was published in the "l'Humanité" on the 21st. The full text of the statement is as follows:

One of the main demands of our people has now finally been realized. The decision on a ceasefire in Indochina was signed in Geneva yesterday.

The people of the world, knowing this important event, breathed a great sigh of relief.

This is the result of more than seven years of struggle by our people, led by the working class. It is the result of the unwavering will and efforts of the Soviet Union, China, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in Geneva, and the result of the struggles of people of all countries.

The French Communist Party, as a political party, has from the beginning and for a long time condemned and opposed this unjust and cruel war, and has not flinched in the face of persecution and oppression.

From the beginning, it came out against the policy of national betrayal and preparation for a third world war, a policy which was demonstrated by the increasingly open interference of the American imperialists in the Indochina War.

The Party, taking up the cause of peace and national interests, pointed out from the beginning that peaceful relations based on equality and mutual benefit could exist between France and Vietnam. The Party called on the people to strive for an end to the war.

Facts have once again proved that the Communist Party is correct.

The heroic dockworkers, sailors, railway workers, metalworkers, and workers in various enterprises, who have strengthened mass action against the war, can now be proud.

The working class, having played a decisive role in uniting all democratic and peaceful forces in the country, can now be proud.

The actions and sacrifices of Leopold Figuères, Henri Martin, and Raymond Dien, which served as symbols and inspirations for action, can now be proud.

All patriots and peace advocates from all walks of life, holding various opinions and beliefs, have come out to strive for a ceasefire, especially those countless French people who sent thousands of representatives to Geneva throughout the Geneva Conference, can now be proud.

The people's action to fight for peace has brought about important political changes in our country.

This action created the conditions for the overthrow of the Laniel-Bidault-Pleven government, and the success of the Geneva negotiations highlighted the terrible burden this government placed on the country.

This action by the people also led those who previously favored waging the Indochina War or were indifferent to it to decide to take a stand in favor of peace.

This made it possible to facilitate the appointment of a Prime Minister who promised to implement a ceasefire. In the vote on the appointment of Mendès France, the French Communist Party once again contributed to the cessation of hostilities, just as it continues to fight for peace and national independence, and for the changes in policy that France needs.

There is no doubt that the ceasefire in Indochina opens up a broad path for this change.

This major achievement in terms of the peace camp and people's independence—an achievement of particular significance for the peoples of France and Indochina—will only further enhance the vigilance of all peace fighters and promote their joint action.

A ceasefire is not yet peace. People see it very clearly. The American imperialists, who advocate expanding the Indochina War to the whole of Asia, although they have suffered a great defeat in Geneva, have by no means abandoned their aggressive plans, especially their plans to conclude the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.

Just as they spared no effort to undermine the negotiations in the past, today they only recognize the separately concluded agreements, leaving room for them to undermine these agreements in the future.

At the same time, we should note that those worst agents of American policy in France, those who advocated carrying the Indochina War to the end, have not given up the idea of ​​relaunching this war.

But the people who made the ceasefire possible are capable of stopping them.

The successful conclusion of the Geneva Conference confirms that it is possible and necessary to resolve other urgent issues related to our destiny and future. According to the wishes of all the people, France can and should immediately say a firm "no" to the establishment of the European Defense Community and to arming German revanchists in any form.

Without a doubt, no one will be allowed to ease tensions in Asia and then intensify provocations and military intervention in North Africa, as people may fear because of recent events and the sending of conscripts.

Now, it is imperative to fully satisfy the most urgent demands of the working class and all working people. This is possible, especially if war expenses are reduced (for example, by restoring the term of service to fifteen months and reducing the excessively large professional army and repressive forces).

The restoration of peace in Indochina will have particularly beneficial effects in all aspects of our country.

Therefore, it should be so, therefore this glorious achievement should be consolidated and developed, we must redouble our efforts to achieve the unity of action of the working class, and we must consolidate the victorious unity of all national and democratic forces.

Long live the people's victory—the Indochina Armistice!

Long live the agreement between the French and Indochinese people!

Long live peace!

### 法国共产党发表声明  欢迎人民的胜利—印度支那停火

    法国共产党发表声明
    欢迎人民的胜利—印度支那停火
    【新华社日内瓦二十二日电】法国共产党在印度支那停战协定缔结后发表了一项声明。这个声明刊在二十一日的“人道报”上。声明全文如下：
    我国人民主要的要求之一，现在终于实现了。关于在印度支那停火的决定昨天已在日内瓦签订了。
    全世界的人知道了这一重大的事情，都大大地松了一口气。
    这是以工人阶级为首的我国人民奋斗七年多的结果。这是苏联、中国、越南民主共和国在日内瓦表现出不屈不挠的意志和进行努力的结果，是各国人民奋斗的结果。
    法国共产党，作为一个政党，一开始而且长期以来就一直谴责并反对这个非正义的残酷的战争，没有在迫害和压迫面前退缩过。
    它一开始就出来反对丧权辱国和准备第三次世界大战的政策，美帝国主义者愈来愈公开地干涉印度支那战争的行为已经说明了这种政策。
    党把和平和民族利益的事业担当起来，一开始就指出，在两国平等和互利的基础上建立的和平关系是能够在法国和越南之间存在的：党号召人民争取结束战争。
    事实再一次证明共产党是正确的。
    英勇的码头工人、海员、铁路工人、五金工人以及各种企业工人，他们曾经加强了群众行动以反对战争，现在可以引以自豪了。
    工人阶级在团结全国一切民主的和和平的力量方面曾经起了决定性的作用，现在可以引以自豪了。
    利奥波德·斐盖尔、亨利·马丁、雷蒙德·第安的行动和牺牲曾经起了行动的象征和鼓舞作用，他们现在可以引以自豪了。
    各阶层的抱着各种意见和信仰的一切爱国人士和和平拥护者曾经出来为争取停火而努力，特别是那些无数的法国人曾在整个日内瓦会议过程中派了成千的代表到日内瓦去，他们现在可以引以自豪了。
    人民争取和平的行动已在我国带来重要的政治变化。
    这种行动为推翻拉尼埃—皮杜尔—普利文政府创造了条件，日内瓦谈判的成功突出地证明了这个政府加于全国的可怕负担。
    人民的这种行动也使那些先前赞成进行印度支那战争或对这个战争漠不关心的人，决定了赞成和平的立场。
    这样就有可能促成一位答应实现停火的总理的任职。在对孟戴斯—弗朗斯的任职进行表决时，法国共产党又一次为停止敌对行动作出贡献，就像它继续为实现和平和民族独立、为实现法国所需要的政策的改变而斗争一样。
    毫无疑问，印度支那的停火为这种改变开辟了宽阔的道路。
    和平阵营和人民独立方面的这种重大成就——对法国和印度支那的人民来说是意义特别重大的成就——只会进一步提高一切和平战士的警惕并促进他们的联合行动。
    停火还不是和平。人们看得很清楚。主张把印度支那战争扩大到整个亚洲的美帝国主义者虽然已在日内瓦遭到巨大的失败，但无论如何并没有使他们放弃他们的侵略计划，特别是他们的缔结东南亚公约的计划。
    正像他们以往不遗余力地破坏谈判一样，今天他们只承认单独缔结的协定，而为他们将来破坏这种协定留下余地。
    同时我们应当注意，美国政策在法国的那些最恶劣的代理人，那些曾主张把印度支那战争进行到底的人，并没有放弃重新发动这场战争的念头。
    但是使停火得以实现的人民是能够阻止他们的。
    日内瓦会议的圆满结局证实了，解决其他关系我国命运和前途的最迫切的问题，是可能的和必要的。根据全体人民的愿望，法国可以而且应当立即对建立欧洲防务集团，对以任何形式武装德国复仇主义者说出一个坚决的“不”字。
    毫无问题，谁都不允许在亚洲的紧张局势得到缓和之后，接着却在北非加紧进行挑衅和军事干涉，由于最近的事件和派遣应征入伍人员，人们可能这样担心。
    现在，充分满足工人阶级和全体劳动人民最迫切的要求是刻不容缓的事了。这样做是可能的，特别是如果战争费用减少的话（譬如把服役期限恢复为十五个月和减少过分庞大的职业军队和弹压部队）。
    印度支那和平的恢复对我国的各方面会产生特别良好的影响。
    因此就应该这样，因此这一辉煌的成就应当加以巩固和发展，我们必须加倍努力以实现工人阶级的行动一致，我们必须巩固一切民族的和民主的力量的胜利的团结。
    人民的胜利——印度支那停火万岁！
    法国人民和印度支那人民之间的协定万岁！
    和平万岁！
