Xinhua News Agency, July 14th—National higher education institutions will simultaneously begin enrollment examinations in seventy-eight large and medium cities across the country from the 15th.

    According to incomplete statistics from the National Higher Education Enrollment Committee, a total of 116,957 people have registered to participate in the unified national higher education enrollment examination. Together with 3,000 primary school teachers taking entrance exams separately held by higher education institutions, and 6,453 outstanding graduates from secondary specialized schools and on-the-job professional cadres, the total number of applicants for higher education reaches 126,410. Among the students participating in the unified examination, there are 67,989 graduates from this year's high schools, 3,961 graduates from workers' and peasants' accelerated secondary schools, 5,847 outstanding graduates from secondary normal schools, 17,523 on-the-job cadres, 2,285 demobilized military cadres, and 19,352 socially knowledgeable youth.

    Before participating in the examination, all applicants underwent health checks organized by the Higher Education Enrollment Working Committees of each major administrative region. The Enrollment Working Committees persuaded students who were unsuitable for enrollment due to illness or physical defects not to apply; for those whose health conditions were unsuitable for the major they applied for, the Enrollment Working Committees made adjustments. This enables higher education institutions to enroll healthy new students.

    Due to the increasing socialist awareness of the applicants, and with the cooperation of the Communist Party committees at all levels and the Communist Youth League organizations at all levels before the application, secondary schools and enrollment working committees at all levels provided them with timely guidance education on further education. Generally, applicants can correctly choose their further education aspirations according to the needs of national construction and their personal conditions, and indicate on the application form that when personal aspirations conflict with national needs, they are willing to obey the state's planned allocation.

    Xinhua News Agency, July 14th—This summer, Peking University, Fudan University, Northwest University and other three comprehensive universities will add law departments. The main task of the university law departments in recent years is to train political and legal work cadres for courts, procuratorates, civil affairs departments and other state organs, and at the same time to train a group of legal professionals for lawyers' associations, notary offices and other state organs and enterprise departments.

    The newly established law department of Peking University will first establish teaching and research offices for the theory of state and law, state law, civil law, and criminal law in the first academic year. Chen Shouyi, the former deputy director of academic affairs of the Central Political and Legal Cadre School, will be the director of the law department of Peking University. Strong teachers have also been transferred from the Renmin University of China and the Beijing University of Political Science and Law. Teaching staff for the law departments of Fudan University and Northwest University are also being equipped. The law departments of the three universities will participate in this year's unified national higher education enrollment.

    【新华社十四日讯】全国高等学校十五日起在全国七十八个大、中城市同时举行招生考试。
    根据全国高等学校招生委员会不完全的统计，这次报名参加全国高等学校统一招生考试的共十一万六千九百五十七人，连同由高等学校单独举行入学考试的小学教师三千人，中等专业学校优秀毕业生及在职专业干部六千四百五十三人，总共报考高等学校的共达十二万六千四百一十人。参加统一考试的学生中，有本年高中毕业生六万七千九百八十九人，工农速成中学毕业生三千九百六十一人，中等师范学校优秀毕业生五千八百四十七人，在职干部一万七千五百二十三人，转业军事干部二千二百八十五人，社会知识青年一万九千三百五十二人。
    报考学生，在参加考试以前，都经各大行政区高等学校招生工作委员会组织他们进行了健康检查。对一些因为疾病或生理缺陷不宜入学的学生，招生工作委员会说服他们不要报考；对因为健康条件不适宜学习所报专业的人，招生工作委员会作了调整。这就使高等学校能够录取身体健康的新生。
    由于报考学生的社会主义觉悟日益提高和报考以前在共产党各级党委领导和青年团各级组织的配合下，中等学校与各级招生工作委员会及时地向他们进行了升学指导教育，一般报考学生都能够根据国家建设需要结合个人条件正确地选择升学志愿，并在报名单上表示：当个人志愿与国家需要有矛盾时，愿意服从国家计划分配。
    【新华社十四日讯】今年暑期，北京大学、复旦大学、西北大学等三所综合大学将增设法律系。大学法律系在最近几年的任务，主要是培养法院、检察署、民政部门和其他国家机关的政法工作干部，同时培养一部分律师团体、公证所和其他国家机关、企业部门的法律专门人材。
    北京大学新建的法律系在第一学年将首先建立国家与法律理论、国家法、民法、刑法等教研室。北京大学法律系将由原中央政法干部学校副教务长陈守一任主任，还从中国人民大学、北京政法学院抽调了较强的教师，复旦大学和西北大学法律系的教学干部也正在配备中。三大学的法律系将参加今年全国高等学校统一招生。
