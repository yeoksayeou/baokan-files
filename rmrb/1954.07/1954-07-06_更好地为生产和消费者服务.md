The New Chengdu Department Store

The People's South Road branch of the Chengdu Department Store, the largest state-owned department store in Sichuan Province, opened on June 5th.

This branch is a four-story building with four business halls covering an area of more than 2,100 square meters, which can accommodate 1,500 to 2,000 customers at the same time, more than twice the size of the old Chengdu Department Store branch. More than 7,000 different varieties and colors of goods are displayed in more than 110 glass counters in the business halls. More than 180 salespersons serve customers here. Chengdu citizens have begun to come here one after another to select various daily necessities. (Wu Zhichen)

Huangshi City Increases Material Supply Points

State-owned commercial departments and cooperatives in the emerging industrial city of Huangshi have added many supply points in basic construction sites and factory and mining areas. At the beginning of this year, the Huangshi Municipal People's Government expanded the original eight state-owned specialized companies into twelve specialized companies, and successively added some new supply points. Before the summer arrived, the nine outlets of the state-owned department store displayed thousands of kinds of summer supplies from Shanghai, Wuhan and other places. The newly established fresh fish and fruit supply station of the food company is crowded with customers every day. State-owned food companies and cooperatives are using a special fish transport boat to transport fresh fish, and are preparing to adopt methods such as "ice-stored fresh fish" and "cellar-refrigerated vegetables" to ensure that workers can often eat fresh fish and vegetables in the summer. During this period, the number of supply and marketing retail stations of supply and marketing cooperatives doubled. Recently, state-owned department stores and food companies have also established many mobile supply groups to conduct business day and night according to workers' production time.

Helping Farmers Eliminate Cotton Aphids

Tangyin County, Henan Province, planted more than 330,000 mu of cotton this year. In June, about 230,000 mu of cotton fields suffered from cotton aphid damage to varying degrees. In order to cooperate with the local party committee and government in leading the aphid extermination and seedling protection campaign, the county supply and marketing cooperative actively carried out the supply of agricultural medicines and agricultural machinery. In addition to allocating the original 20,000 kilograms of cotton oil soap, more than 500 kilograms of "666" powder and more than 1,200 sprayers to various supply points in a timely manner, the county cooperative association also purchased a large number of pesticides and transported them to grassroots cooperatives for supply. At the same time, technicians were sent to the countryside to teach the methods of using agricultural medicines and machinery, and to help the masses repair agricultural machinery. According to the statistics of 18 grassroots cooperatives such as Wuling, 88 cadres have been transferred successively to form 39 groups to go to the countryside to help farmers eliminate cotton aphids.

Supporting Farmers to Increase Hog Production

The Zichuan County Cooperative Association of Shandong Province recently established a distiller's grains supply group to be responsible for supplying distiller's grains and other feeds to farmers for pig raising. According to incomplete statistics, 1.5 million kilograms of distiller's grains produced by the Zichuan Distillery have been supplied to farmers in the past month. At the same time, more than 1.3 million kilograms of distiller's grains and 910,000 kilograms of bean cake were purchased from other places, and are now being actively supplied. After the difficulty of feed was solved, the enthusiasm of farmers to raise pigs has been further improved. The agricultural production cooperatives in the county alone plan to increase the number of hogs raised by more than 270.

Let the Baoji-Chengdu Railway be Completed Soon

Guangyuan County State-owned Trading Company, Coal Industry Building Materials Company and State-owned Department Store in Sichuan Province actively supply building materials, fuel and daily necessities needed by railway construction workers and construction projects along the 143-kilometer Guangyuan to Lueyang section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway. This year, Guangyuan State-owned Trading Company and Department Store have supplied 12.1 billion yuan worth of materials to railway construction units and workers, and the Coal Industry Building Materials Company has supplied more than 2,600 tons of lump coal.

These units have dispatched full-time cadres and established regular contact with the railway life supply station and the purchasing personnel of various engineering sections and engineering teams. The trading company has set up mobile service groups in Datang and other places where Sichuan, Shaanxi and Gansu provinces meet. The number of non-staple foods supplied by the company has increased from more than 20 to more than 100. In the first quarter, the department store added more than 800 new products. In the towering mountains, the railway construction workers can also eat delicious Jiange preserved pork and sausages, Chengdu candies and biscuits, as well as kelp, cuttlefish and other aquatic products produced along the coast. Film goggles, long rubber boots, and storm lanterns have been promptly transported from Shanghai, Tianjin, and other places to the construction site by the department store. Recently, the trading company also supplied a large number of sleeping mats, straw hats, fans, straw sandals, and Hang chrysanthemums that can relieve heat to the railway construction workers.

Promoting Local and Special Products for Ethnic Minorities

Wangmo County, Guizhou Province, is rich in local and special products such as kapok, fungus, Polygonum multiflorum, and Asparagus officinalis. The annual output of Polygonum multiflorum is about 500,000 kilograms, and the annual output of Asparagus officinalis is about 80,000 kilograms. After the county's state-owned ethnic trade store actively sought sales channels, the county's fungus, tongcao and other products have been sold well in Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chongqing and other places.

This year, the county's ethnic trade store widely publicized the specifications, production methods and prices of these local and special products by displaying samples, and local ethnic minorities enthusiastically processed and sold these products. Now, each session can generally purchase more than 4,000 kilograms of Polygonum multiflorum, more than 1,000 kilograms of Asparagus officinalis, and more than 2,000 kilograms of kapok; the purchase volume of kapok has greatly exceeded that of last year. By the end of May, the local and special products such as kapok, fungus, Polygonum multiflorum, Asparagus officinalis, fire saltpeter, and cattle hide purchased by the Wangmo County Ethnic Trade Store reached 45 tons. After selling these products, farmers of all ethnic groups can exchange them for 760,000 kilograms of rice or more than 30,000 pieces of iron farm tools.

Shanghai Autumn Department Stores Shipped to Various Places in Advance

The Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station of China Department Store Company transferred autumn department stores to various places in advance. As of June 18, more than 300 train carriages (weighing more than 6,000 tons) of goods had been shipped, accounting for 10% of the station's third-quarter allocation plan.

This year, the station's allocation plan for autumn goods has increased by 40% compared with last year, and the variety of colors has also increased a lot. The Chinese-style health shirts were very popular among workers and farmers last year, and this year the station's allocation plan for this commodity has increased by nearly four times compared with last year.

Due to the station's advance allocation, the time for Shanghai's autumn goods to arrive in more than 100 material distribution centers, important construction sites and border cities across the country will be one to two months earlier than last year.

Organize Winter Goods Sources as Soon as Possible

The Changchun Purchasing and Supply Wholesale Station of China Department Store Company has begun to organize the supply of winter materials. They first established a winter goods group, and compiled a winter goods supply plan based on the past sales of winter goods and consumers' opinions on winter goods. At present, most of the commodities such as felt hat heads, felt socks, cotton leather shoes, and wool yarn have been determined the source of goods according to the plan; about 50% of the source of goods for commodities such as leather has also been organized. This year, they collected many new patterns and organized the trial production of more than 100 new samples of sweaters, woolen trousers, woolen socks, woolen triangular scarves, children's cloaks and leather hats. In June, cadres were sent to factories, institutions, and schools with these samples to solicit opinions, and these new products are now being organized for production according to consumers' opinions.

    更好地为生产和消费者服务
    成都的新百货大楼
    四川省最大的国营百货商店——成都市百货商店人民南路门市部在六月五日开幕了。
    这个门市部是一座四层大楼，四个营业厅面积达二千一百多平方公尺，可以同时容纳一千五百个到两千个顾客，比成都市百货商店旧有的门市部大一倍多。营业厅中的一百一十多个玻璃货柜内，陈列着七千多种不同品种、花色的商品。在这里有一百八十多个营业员为顾客们服务。成都市市民已开始陆续到这里来选择各种日用百货。（吴之琛）
    黄石市增设物资供应点
    新兴的工业城市黄石市的国营商业部门和合作社在基本建设工地和厂矿区增设了许多供应点。今年年初，黄石市人民政府就把原有的八个国营专业公司扩充为十二个专业公司，同时陆续增设了一些新供应点。当夏季还没有到来的时候，国营百货公司的九个门市部里，就陈列着上千种来自上海、武汉等地的夏季用品。在新成立的食品公司的鲜鱼和水果供应站里，每天都挤满了顾客。国营食品公司和合作社正在用一种特制的运鱼船运鲜鱼，并且准备采用“冰藏鲜鱼”、“地窖冷藏蔬菜”等办法，保证工人在夏天能经常吃到新鲜的鱼类和蔬菜。在这个期间，供销合作社的供销零售站增加了一倍。最近，国营百货公司和食品公司还成立了许多流动供应组，根据工人生产时间日夜流动营业。
    帮助农民除治棉蚜虫
    河南省汤阴县今年种了三十三万多亩棉花，六月间有大约二十三万亩棉田发生了不同程度的棉蚜虫害。为了配合当地党委和政府领导开展的灭蚜保苗运动，全县供销合作社积极展开农业药剂和农业药械的供应工作。县合作社联合社除将原有的两万多斤棉油皂、五百多斤“六六六”药粉和一千二百多架喷雾器及时调拨各供应点外，又新购进大批农药运到各基层合作社进行供应。同时派出技术员，下乡传授农药械使用方法，帮助群众修理农业药械。据五陵等十八个基层合作社的统计，已先后抽调干部八十八人，组成三十九个小组，下乡帮助农民除治棉蚜虫。
    支持农民增产毛猪
    山东省淄川县合作社联合社不久以前成立了一个酒糟供应组，负责将酒糟等供应给农民作养猪饲料。据不完全统计，一个月来，已将淄川酒厂产的一百五十万斤酒糟供应给农民。同时，从外地采购了酒糟一百三十余万斤、豆饼九十一万斤，现正积极进行供应。饲料困难解决以后，农民养猪积极性更加提高。仅全县的农业生产合作社就计划增养毛猪二百七十余头。
    让宝成铁路早日建成
    四川省广元县国营贸易公司、煤业建筑器材公司和国营百货商店，积极供应宝成铁路南段广元至陕西略阳一百四十三公里沿线筑路职工和建筑工程需要的器材、燃料和生活用品。广元国营贸易公司和百货商店今年已供应给筑路单位和职工的物资值一百二十一亿元，煤业建筑器材公司供应的块煤已有二千六百多吨。
    这些单位都派专职干部和铁路生活供应站、各工程段、工程队的采购人员建立了经常的联系。贸易公司在四川、陕西、甘肃三省交界的大滩等地设立了流动服务组。该公司供应的副食品已由二十多种增加到一百多种。百货商店在第一季度就增加了八百多种新商品。在崇山峻岭中，筑路的职工也能吃到味美可口的剑阁腊肉、香肠，成都市的糖果、饼干，以及沿海出产的海带、墨鱼等水产。胶片风镜、长统胶靴、风雨灯等，已由百货商店及时从上海、天津等地运到工地。最近，贸易公司还供应给筑路职工大批凉席、草帽、扇子、草鞋以及能解暑热的杭菊。
    为少数民族推销土产特产
  　贵州省望谟县盛产木棉、木耳、何首乌、天门冬等土产和特产品。何首乌的年产量约五十万斤，天门冬年产量约八万斤。经过该县国营民族贸易商店积极找销路，现在该县出产的木耳、通草等已畅销上海、广州、重庆等地。
    今年该县民族贸易商店用陈列样品等办法，广泛宣传了这些土产和特产的规格、制法和价格，当地少数民族踊跃加工和出售这些产品。现在，每场一般可收购何首乌四千多斤、天门冬一千多斤、木棉两千多斤；木棉收购量已大大超过去年。到五月底止，望谟县民族贸易商店收购的木棉、木耳、何首乌、天门冬、火硝、牛皮等土产和特产品即达四十五吨。各族农民卖出这些产品以后，可以换回七十六万斤大米或者三万多件铁质农具。
    上海秋季百货提前运往各地
    中国百货公司上海采购供应站提前往各地调拨秋季百货。到六月十八日止，已经运出三百多个车皮（重六千余吨）的货物，占该站第三季度调拨计划的百分之十。
    今年该站秋令百货调拨计划比去年增大了四成，花色也增加不少。对襟卫生衫去年很受工人和农民欢迎，今年该站这项商品的调拨计划比去年增大了近四倍。
    由于该站提前调拨，今年全国一百多个物资集散地、重要工地和边疆城市运到的上海秋令百货的时间，将比去年提前一个月到两个月。
    及早组织冬季货源
    中国百货公司长春采购供应批发站已开始组织冬季的供应物资。他们首先成立了冬货小组，根据过去冬季货物的销售情况和消费者对冬货的意见，编制了冬货供应计划。现在，毡帽头、毡袜、棉皮鞋、毛线等大部分商品已经按计划确定了货源；皮张等商品也有百分之五十左右的货源已经组织妥当。今年他们搜集了很多新花样，组织试制了毛衣、毛裤、毛袜、毛三角巾、小孩斗篷和皮帽子等
  一百多种新样品。六月间，派干部携带这些样品到工厂、机关、学校征求了意见，现正按照消费者的意见组织生产这些新商品。（李甲滨  于清波）
