Shaanxi Province has basically completed its summer harvest work in most areas. In the main wheat-producing areas of Guanzhong and southern Shaanxi, except for a few mountainous areas, the fields have been cleared. In the northern Shaanxi area, counties south of Yan'an, such as Huangling, Yichuan, and Luochuan, are ripening later and are currently in the process of harvesting and threshing.

The actual yield in areas where harvesting and threshing have been completed has increased compared to last year, marking another bumper harvest following the bumper harvest of 1953. In the Hanzhong area, the average yield per mu of over 1.7 million mu of wheat was 172.6 jin, an increase of more than 7.5% compared to last year. The average yield per mu of wheat in Xianyang City has exceeded 300 jin. The total yield of 55 mu of wheat in the Sun Baocang mutual aid team in Xinjian Township, Xunyang County, increased by one-third compared to last year. In some areas, many high-yield households with wheat yields of 800 to 900 jin per mu have been discovered.

Amidst the general bumper harvest, the yields of some state-owned farms are particularly outstanding. The average yield per mu of 167 mu of wheat at the Erqing Wangcun work station of the Provincial Experimental Farm was 472.8 jin, 136.8 jin higher than the average yield per mu in Erqing Wangcun. The yield per mu of 178 mu of dryland wheat at the Chaoyi County Farm was more than 19% higher than last year and 29% higher than the local average yield per mu. The yields of agricultural producers' cooperatives in various places have also greatly improved compared to last year. At present, some organized farmers are combining field management of autumn crops with discussions on wheat high-yield experiences, and are carrying out work such as exchanging improved varieties and eradicating stubble to prepare the ground for next year's wheat bumper harvest.

    陕西省夏收基本结束产量超过去年
    陕西省夏收工作大部地区已经基本结束。主要产麦区的关中和陕南一带，除了个别山区外，已作到场光地净。陕北地区延安以南的黄陵、宜川、洛川等县成熟较晚，现在正在收割、打场中。
    已经收碾完毕的地区的实产量，均较去年增加，是继一九五三年丰收后的又一次丰收。汉中专区一百七十多万亩小麦，平均亩产量一百七十二点六斤，比去年增产百分之七点五以上。咸阳市小麦平均亩产量已超过三百斤。洵阳县新建乡孙保仓互助组五十五亩小麦总产量，比去年增加了三分之一。部分地区已发现了不少小麦亩产量达八、九百斤的高额丰产户。
    在普遍的丰收中，一些国营农场的产量特别突出。省试验农场二青王村作业站的一百六十七亩小麦平均亩产四百七十二点八斤，高出所在地二青王村平均亩产量一百三十六点八斤。朝邑县农场的一百七十八亩旱地小麦，亩产量高出去年百分之十九以上，高出当地平均亩产量百分之二十九。各地农业生产合作社的产量，也都比去年大大提高。目前，一些组织起来的农民正结合大秋作物的田间管理，开始座谈小麦丰产经验，并进行调换良种和灭槎整地等工作，给明年小麦丰产创造条件。
