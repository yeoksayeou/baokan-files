Speech by Chen Qiyou, Chairman of the China Zhi Gong Party

The Geneva Conference on the restoration of peace in Indochina, after seventy-five days of discussions, came to a victorious close on July 21st. In the final plenary session, a glorious agreement on the cessation of hostilities and restoration of peace in Indochina was reached. This agreement will not only end the eight-year Indochina war, realizing the desire for peace of the people of Indochina and the French people, but it will also promote the cause of peace in Asia and the world. We cheer for this major historical achievement.

During the discussion of the Indochina issue at the Geneva Conference, the representatives of the US ruling clique, headed by Dulles, were constantly using all kinds of sinister tricks to widen differences, create obstacles, and attempt to undermine the progress of the conference, obstruct the realization of the world's people's desire for peaceful consultation on international issues and peaceful coexistence among all countries, thereby directly interfering in and expanding the Indochina war, carrying out their new military adventures, and promoting their new colonial plans. However, all these conspiracies and tricks of the United States have not stopped the world's people's demand for peace. The Geneva Conference finally cleared away all the obstacles and sabotage set up by the United States and reached an agreement. The conclusion of this agreement is another major victory for the principle of peaceful consultation and peaceful coexistence. It proves to the world that in the current international situation, any international dispute must and can be resolved through peaceful consultation. The imperialist "policy of strength" of using force to resolve international disputes is unworkable.

The Geneva Conference agreement on Indochina was reached on the basis of respecting the national rights of the Indochinese people to peace, independence, freedom, democracy, and unity; only in this way could agreement be reached with the consent of both parties. Because in today's world where people have awakened, new or old colonial policies are impossible to exist.

The agreement on the Indochina issue once again demonstrates to the US ruling clique and its lackeys the undeniable fact that our country is one of the world's great powers. In international affairs, China, with its 600 million people, has the right and the obligation to be involved. If this fact is ignored, international issues, especially Asian issues, cannot be truly resolved.

The Chinese delegation, headed by Premier and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai, consistently adhered to our country's consistent peaceful diplomatic policy at the Geneva Conference, and made unremitting efforts to promote the conclusion of the agreement, fully embodying the unwavering and firm will of the people of our country to strive for world peace. We are extremely honored by the efforts and achievements of our delegation at the Geneva Conference, and at the same time, we extend our highest respect to Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai and all the comrades of the delegation.

The countries concerned must ensure the implementation of the Indochina armistice agreement and prevent any conspiracy to undermine peace in Indochina. We must especially recognize that the first objective of the Geneva Conference—the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue—has not yet been achieved due to the US imperialists' efforts to obstruct it in every possible way. The US imperialists have recently been massively assisting the Chiang Kai-shek remnant bandit gang, expanding their military strength, and disturbing the coastal areas of Fujian and Zhejiang in our country, openly clamoring that they hope the Chiang bandits will attack our country. We cannot but loudly warn the US imperialists: Taiwan is the sacred territory of the People's China, and the Chiang Kai-shek remnant bandit gang is a public enemy that the Chinese people must thoroughly eliminate. The Chinese people must liberate Taiwan and will never stop until they achieve their goal. Whoever obstructs the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan will suffer the consequences.

    中国致公党主席陈其尤的谈话
    日内瓦会议关于恢复印度支那和平问题经过七十五天的讨论，已于七月二十一日胜利闭幕了。在最后一次的全体会议上达成了关于印度支那停战和恢复和平问题的光荣协议。这协议不仅将结束八年的印度支那战争，实现印度支那人民和法国人民的和平愿望，而且它更将促进亚洲和全世界的和平事业。我们为这一重大历史性的成就而欢呼。
    在日内瓦会议讨论印度支那问题的过程中，以杜勒斯为首的美国统治集团的代表们一直是竭尽一切鬼魊伎俩，扩大分歧，制造障碍，企图破坏会议的进行，阻挠全世界人民所要求的国际问题和平协商与世界各国和平共处的愿望的实现，从而直接干涉并扩大印度支那战争，进行其新的军事冒险，推行其新的殖民计划。但是美国的这一切阴谋诡计都没有阻挡得住全世界人民对和平的要求，日内瓦会议终于扫清了美国所布置的一切阻挠和破坏而达成了协议。这个协议的达成，是和平协商与和平共处这一原则的又一重大胜利，它向全世界证明了在目前国际形势下，任何国际争端都必须而且可能用和平协商的方式来解决。用武力来解决国际争端的帝国主义的“实力政策”是行不通的。
    日内瓦会议关于印度支那的协议，是在尊重印度支那人民的和平、独立、自由、民主和统一的民族权利的基础上达成的；也只有如此，才能获得双方的同意而达成协议。因为在全世界人民已经觉醒的今天，新的或旧的殖民政策是不可能存在了。
    印度支那问题的达成协议，向美国统治集团及其仆从们再一次说明我国是世界大国之一的不容否认的事实。在国际问题上，拥有六亿人口的中国是有权利、有义务来过问的。如果忽视了这一事实，国际问题，特别是亚洲问题，就不可能得到真正的解决。
    以周恩来总理兼外长为首的我国代表团，在日内瓦会议上，始终本着我国一贯的和平外交政策，不懈地努力于促成协议的达成，充分体现了我国全国人民争取世界和平的不屈不挠的坚强意志。我们对于我国代表团在日内瓦会议上的努力和成就，感到极大的光荣，同时并向周恩来外长和代表团全体同志们致以崇高的敬意。
    有关各国必须保证印度支那停战协议的实施，防止任何破坏印度支那和平的阴谋。我们尤要认识，日内瓦会议的第一个目的——朝鲜问题的和平解决，由于美帝国主义的千方百计的阻挠，还没有达成协议。美帝国主义近来更正在大量帮助蒋介石残余匪帮，扩充兵力，扰乱我福建、浙江沿海一带，公开扬言希望蒋匪进攻我国。我们不能不大声警告美帝国主义：台湾是人民中国的神圣领土，蒋介石残余匪帮是中国人民必须彻底消灭的公敌。中国人民必须解放台湾，不达目的决不休止。谁阻挠中国人民解放台湾，谁就要自食其恶果。
