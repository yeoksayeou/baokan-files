Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 29th: The Standing Committee of the National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam held an enlarged meeting on the 28th, presided over by Chairman Ton Duc Thang, and passed a resolution on the signing of the Indochina armistice agreement.

The resolution stated that the enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee of the National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believes that the agreement to cease hostilities throughout Indochina is a major victory for the people of Vietnam, as well as the people of Laos and Cambodia, and also a victory for the world peace movement. This great victory is only the first step. The Vietnamese people should continue to struggle through peaceful means in order to continue to move forward. They should also be vigilant against the war-mongers' conspiracies to obstruct the implementation of the armistice agreement and undermine peace in Indochina.

The resolution stated that the enlarged meeting passed:

(1) Full agreement with the political line and peaceful policies of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, expressing confidence in the government, and full confidence in the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh.

(2) Calling on the representatives of the National Assembly and the people of the whole country to recognize this major diplomatic victory, strictly abide by the armistice agreement, and at the same time urge the French government to faithfully implement the agreed terms. The Vietnamese people are determined to achieve unification and seek independence and democracy throughout the country.

The enlarged meeting also sent a letter to President Ho Chi Minh to pay tribute and congratulate him, expressing the Vietnamese people's trust in his leadership. The meeting also issued a proclamation to the representatives of the National Assembly and the people of the whole country.
