Xinhua News Agency, July 15th: According to TASS, New Delhi, July 14th: Madras' "The Hindu" in an editorial demanded the restoration of the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations. The newspaper wrote: "India, Britain, and recently New Zealand have said that they believe that allowing China to replace the Chiang Kai-shek regime to gain a position in the United Nations is an important step towards further peaceful resolution (of international disputes)... Obviously, only the Chinese government in Beijing is the government ruling the entire country."
    The newspaper condemned the United States for undermining the United Nations and emphasized, "The United Nations stipulates that governments with various types of ideas can gather in its meeting places; its main purpose is to make the idea of peaceful coexistence a reality."

Xinhua News Agency, July 16th: According to the Indian News Service, New Delhi: Indian newspapers commented on British Prime Minister Churchill's speech in the House of Commons on the 12th.

    "The Indian Express" commented: "Two main conditions for peaceful coexistence are: China's entry into the United Nations, and the unification of Germany and Korea through agreements." "It is clear to everyone that as long as the status of Communist China is ignored, the solution to any Asian problem is impossible."

    "The Hindu" said: The entry of the People's Republic of China into the United Nations would be a "positive step" towards a political solution to the Far East problem. The commentary said: "The United Nations is for governments with different ideologies to meet in its meeting halls; its main purpose is to put the concept of 'peaceful coexistence' into practice." The commentary expressed regret that the United States was unwilling to "give this issue calm consideration."

    "The Hindustan Times" said, "If Britain and the United States truly accept the idea of peaceful coexistence that China and India have already accepted -- which the Soviet spokesman reiterated with approval --... then this would indeed be the biggest step towards peace in the world since the Cold War occurred in a war-weary world." The newspaper, in referring to the purpose of Churchill's statement, said that the main purpose of Churchill's speech was to restore understanding with the United States. However, the newspaper pointed out: "Many impartial observers will still think that what has been achieved in Washington is merely an unstable understanding that conceals the deeper divisions in US-British policies, and has not fully aligned their intentions."

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, July 16th: Indonesian Foreign Ministry officials told reporters from "The Eastern Star" on the 10th that if the People's Republic of China enters the United Nations, it will lead Asia, especially Southeast Asia, to the road of stability, peace, and prosperity. They said that those who are unwilling for the People's Republic of China to enter the United Nations must recognize the current reality. Judging from the situation in Asia, especially in Southeast Asia, and especially from the recent assumption of its task by the People's Republic of China on Asian issues, the Indonesian government will consider supporting the People's Republic of China's entry into the United Nations.

    Regarding the current Sino-Indonesian trade negotiations, they said that these negotiations are progressing smoothly and to the satisfaction of both parties. If anyone says that these negotiations will not achieve the expected results, it is because these people want to ignore realities they dislike.

    "The Eastern Star" published an editorial on the 13th, saying that American policy is based on gold. The United States hopes to use gold to buy the whole world and the will of other countries. The newspaper asked: If the United States truly hopes for peace and a peaceful resolution of the Indochina war, then why did Dulles resist the Geneva Conference? The newspaper also said that the existence of the People's Republic of China is a reality, and the whole world, including the United States' vassal states, cannot deny this reality. If the United States does not adapt its attitude to reality, it will be like climbing a mountain peak, and once it falls, it will never be able to climb up again.

    "The Eternity Daily" also published an editorial on the 13th, saying that in the eyes of people with realistic minds, the issue of the People's Republic of China's status in the United Nations is no longer a matter of debate. Because this is a reality that must be recognized, whether you like it or not.

    印度和印尼报纸、印尼官方人士
    要求恢复我国在联合国的合法权利
    【新华社十五日讯】据塔斯社新德里十四日讯：马德拉斯的“印度教徒报”在社论中要求恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利。这家报纸写道：“印度、英国，最近还有新西兰都说，它们相信，让中国来代替蒋介石政权取得在联合国中的地位，是走向进一步和平解决（国际争端）的道路的一个重要步骤……显然，只有北京的中国政府才是统治全国的政府。”
    报纸谴责美国破坏联合国的活动，并强调指出，“联合国规定具有各种类型思想的政府能在它的会议场所集会；它的主要目的是要使和平共处的思想变成现实。”
    【新华社十六日讯】据印度新闻处新德里消息：印度报纸就英国首相邱吉尔十二日在下院的发言发表评论。
    “印度快报”评论说：“和平共处的两个主要条件是：中国进入联合国，通过协议统一德国和朝鲜。”“大家都清楚看到的是：只要共产党中国的地位遭到漠视，任何亚洲问题的解决都是不可能的。”
    “印度教徒报”说：中华人民共和国之进入联合国将是导向远东问题政治解决的“积极步骤”。评论说：“联合国是供思想意识各不相同的政府在它的会议厅里开会的；它的主要目的是使‘和平共处’的概念付诸实施。”评论对于美国不肯“对这个问题作冷静的考虑”表示惋惜。
    “印度斯坦时报”说，“如果英美两国真的接受中国和印度所已接受的和平共处的想法——苏联发言人以赞同的态度重申了这种想法——……那么，这实在会是自冷战在厌战的世界发生以来，世界走向和平的最大的一步。”这家报纸谈到邱吉尔声明的目的说，邱吉尔的发言的主要目的是要恢复和美国的谅解。但是，这家报纸指出：“许多公正的观察家依然会认为，在华盛顿所获致的东西，只不过是一个掩饰着美英两国政策分裂的较深的分歧的不稳固的谅解，而未使双方的心意完全一致。”
    【新华社雅加达十六日电】印尼外交部人士十日向“东星报”记者说，如果中华人民共和国进入联合国，便能使亚洲，特别是东南亚，走向稳定、和平和繁荣的道路。他们说，那些不愿中华人民共和国进入联合国的人必须认识目前的现实。从亚洲情况、特别是东南亚情况看来，并特别从中华人民共和国最近在亚洲问题上开始担负起它的任务看来，印尼政府将考虑支持中华人民共和国进入联合国。
    关于目前中印（尼）贸易商谈问题，他们说，这种商谈正在顺利地和在对双方都满意的情况下进行着。要是有人说，这种商谈不会获得预期的结果，那是因为这些人想要漠视他们所不喜欢的现实。
    “东星报”十三日发表社论说，美国的政策是以金元为基础的。美国希望以金元来购买全世界以及其他国家的意志。这个报纸问道：如果美国真正希望和平与和平解决印度支那战争，那么杜勒斯为什么要抵制日内瓦会议呢？报纸又说，中华人民共和国的存在是一个现实，全世界，包括美国的附庸国在内，都无法否认这种现实。如果美国不使它的态度适应现实，它便像攀登一座山峰一样，跌倒了就永远爬不起来了。
    “永恒报”十三日也发表社论说，在有现实头脑的人们看来，中华人民共和国在联合国的地位问题已经不成为一个引起争论的问题。因为这是一种必须承认的现实，不管你喜欢也罢，不喜欢也罢。
