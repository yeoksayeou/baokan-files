In the Jinsha River valley area of Yunnan Province, Han, Mosi, Lisu, and Hui farmers in Yongsheng, Huaping, Heqing, and other counties planted over 6,000 mu of early cotton this year. Most cotton plants are as tall as three chi, with dense and robust branches, each plant bearing forty to fifty cotton bolls. Currently, cotton farmers are happily harvesting the first blooms. Generally, each mu of cotton field can yield 100 to 150 jin of seed cotton, with the highest yield reaching 300 to 400 jin, an increase of more than 50% compared to previous years.

The Yang Yougui mutual aid team in Taoyuan Township, Yongsheng County, with its twenty-seven households, only harvested 40 jin of seed cotton per mu last year. This year, after organizing a mutual aid team, they built water conservancy projects and irrigated the cotton fields three times. They bought one sprayer and sixty packs of "666" pesticide powder to eliminate insects three times. They also applied fifty loads of manure per mu, weeded six times, and pruned and topped the plants. The average yield per mu was 120 jin of seed cotton, a twofold increase compared to last year and a 50% increase compared to previous years. Currently, farmers of all ethnic groups are actively harvesting cotton, preparing to sell it to the state after ginning.

Due to the bumper harvest of early cotton in many mutual aid teams this year, many individual farmers have joined mutual aid teams. Some mutual aid teams are summarizing their experiences, and the members have expressed that they now see the path more clearly. They will actively consolidate and improve the mutual aid teams in the future and strive to establish agricultural production cooperatives.

    云南省永胜华坪等县早棉比往年增产五成
    云南省金沙江沿岸永胜、华坪、鹤庆等县的汉族、摩西族、傈僳族、回族农民，今年栽种了早棉六千余亩。大部棉株高达三尺，棉枝茂密茁壮，每株结桃四十到五十个。目前棉农们正高兴地收摘头花。每亩棉田一般可收籽棉一百斤到一百五十斤，最高达三、四百斤，比往年增产百分之五十以上。
    永胜县桃园乡杨友贵互助组的二十七户农民，去年每亩只收得籽棉四十斤，今年大家组织了互助组，兴修了水利，棉田浇灌了三次，买了一架喷雾器、六十包“六六六”药粉除虫三次，每亩田又压了五十背粪，薅六道草，摘心整枝，每亩平均产籽花一百二十斤，比去年增产二倍，比往年产量增产百分之五十。现在，各族农民都积极收棉，准备打籽后把棉花卖给国家。
    由于今年许多互助组的早棉得到丰收，许多单干农民都参加了互助组。有的互助组正进行总结，组员们表示：这回道路看得更清楚了，以后要积极巩固提高互助组，争取办农业生产合作社。
