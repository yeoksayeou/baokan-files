Comrade Huang Yanpei, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Democratic National Construction, said:

    The Geneva Conference, which is of close concern to people all over the world, has finally reached an agreement on the restoration of peace in Indochina and concluded successfully on July 21.
    For many years, the goal of the Indochinese people's struggle has been to strive for national independence and freedom, and to realize the country's democratic unification and lasting peace. The agreement reached at this conference clearly conforms to the wishes of the Indochinese people, and also conforms to the wishes of peace-loving people all over the world. As Premier Zhou pointed out in his speech at the Geneva Conference on July 21: "The restoration of peace in Indochina and the independence and unification of the three Indochinese countries are not only the deep aspirations of the Indochinese and French people, but also the common demands of peace-loving people in Asia and the world."
    People all over the world can see that the conclusion of the Indochina issue agreement marks another major victory for the principles of peaceful consultation and peaceful coexistence. It proves that the road of resolving international disputes by force is unworkable, and the only correct and workable road is to resolve international disputes through consultation. It has brought another and even more shameful defeat to the "policy of strength" pursued by U.S. imperialism.
    All the Chinese people and the people of the world are unanimously feeling infinite joy and encouragement for the conclusion of this agreement; in particular, they are even more excited and honored by the tremendous efforts and contributions made by our delegation headed by Premier Zhou Enlai at the Geneva Conference.
    The People's Republic of China is participating for the first time as one of the world's major powers in consultations with other major powers on major international issues, but the efforts made by our delegation at the conference and its contribution to Asian and world peace have been enormous and have been praised by widespread public opinion around the world. China's international status as one of the world's major powers has also been universally recognized.
    This is a historic change in China's national international status. This achievement is the result of the great achievements made by the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao in leading us in active construction and on all fronts in recent years. Every Chinese person will feel honored to see our country's increasing strength and the respect it has won among the people of the world, and will be proud of our country's great contribution to the cause of world peace.
    We must also recognize that the realization of the Indochina armistice is only the first step in peacefully resolving the Indochina issue. In order to consolidate peace in Indochina and lead to the strengthening of peace in Asia, we must, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, unite with the people of the whole country and the peace-loving people of all countries to make persistent efforts and continue to struggle to eliminate the danger of war and strive for lasting peace.

    中国民主建国会总会主任委员
    黄炎培的谈话
    全世界人民密切关心的日内瓦会议，终于就恢复印度支那和平问题获致了协议，在七月二十一日圆满结束了。
    很多年来，印度支那人民奋斗的目的，就是为了争取民族独立和自由，实现国家的民主统一和持久和平。这次会议上所获致的协议，显然是符合印度支那人民的愿望，而同时也符合全世界爱好和平人民的愿望的。正如周总理七月二十一日在日内瓦会议中发言时指出的：“印度支那和平的恢复和印度支那三国的独立和统一不仅是印度支那人民和法国人民的深切愿望，同时也是亚洲及全世界爱好和平人民的共同要求。”
    全世界人民都看出，印度支那问题协议的达成，标志着和平协商与和平共处原则的又一次重大胜利。它证明了用武力解决国际争端的道路是行不通的，唯一正确而又行得通的道路是用协商方式解决国际争端的道路。它使美帝国主义所奉行的“实力政策”遭到了又一次更可耻的挫败。
    全中国人民以及全世界人民一致地对这个协议的达成，感到无限的欢欣和鼓舞；特别是对以周恩来总理为首的我国代表团在日内瓦会议中的巨大努力和贡献，更感到兴奋和光荣。
    中华人民共和国是第一次以世界大国之一的身份和其他大国一起协商重大国际问题的，但我国代表团在会议中所作的努力以及它的成就所给予亚洲和世界和平的贡献，则是异常巨大的，获得了全世界广泛舆论的赞扬。我国是世界大国之一的国际地位，也已为举世所公认了。
    这是中国国家在国际地位上的历史性变化，这种成就是中国共产党和毛主席领导我们几年来积极建设和在各个战线上所获致的伟大成就的结果。每个中国人民看到我国的日益壮大和它在世界人民中所获致的尊崇，都会感觉到光荣，并为我国对世界和平事业所作出的伟大贡献而感到骄傲。
    我们还要认识印度支那停战的实现，只是和平解决印度支那问题的第一步。为了巩固印度支那的和平并导致亚洲和平的加强，我们一定要在中国共产党和毛主席领导下，和全国人民一起联合各国爱好和平的人民，再接再厉，为消灭战争危险，争取持久和平而继续奋斗。
