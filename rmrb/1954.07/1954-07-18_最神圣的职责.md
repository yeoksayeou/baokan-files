    The Most Sacred Duty
    Chai Xuejiu, Deputy Head of an Engineering Regiment of the Chinese People's Volunteers, "One-Armed Blasting Hero"
    On June 15th, after breakfast, I listened to the broadcast of the draft constitution together with the deputy branch leader, deputy political commissar, chief of staff, and director. At that time, I remember most clearly: "The armed forces of the People's Republic of China belong to the people. Their task is to defend the achievements of the people's revolution and national construction, and to defend national security and the integrity of territorial sovereignty." After listening, I silently thought: what a solemn, great, and glorious task this is! A few days later, the "People's Daily" arrived, and I repeatedly read the draft constitution several times, and repeatedly studied the content of Article 20. Then, I studied the instructions of the leadership organs of the Chinese People's Volunteers regarding the publicity and discussion of the draft constitution. Through these studies, I deeply felt the importance of my responsibility. Because this fundamental law of the country, which will soon be discussed, passed, and promulgated at the National People's Congress, protects the interests of the working people in every word and every article. It not only consolidates the achievements of our people's revolution, but also mobilizes and organizes the people of the whole country to transition to a socialist society. However, imperialists and domestic counter-revolutionary elements will inevitably try every means to undermine our cause. The draft constitution also clearly stipulates the need to "suppress all treasonous and counter-revolutionary activities and punish all traitors and counter-revolutionary elements." Not long ago, in the study of the general line, I was already very clear about this point. The Chinese people have struggled for more than a hundred years, and under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, we have established our own country. How many comrades shed their blood, and how many people sacrificed their lives. Not to mention anything else, just like the respectable Comrade Yang Gensi, who dedicated his heroic life on the front line of resisting America and aiding Korea. In the Battle of Shangganling, which I personally participated in, when the comrades thought of "Five Holy Mountains behind Beijing", they all bravely moved forward, and many comrades heroically sacrificed themselves. The constitution is the crystallization of the blood and sweat of how many comrades and how many people; realizing socialism is also the desire of the vast people of the whole country. I am a citizen of the People's Republic of China, and also a soldier of the Chinese People's Volunteers. Obeying the constitution and ensuring its implementation is my most sacred duty.

    最神圣的职责
    志愿军某工兵团副团长  “独臂爆破英雄”  柴学久
    六月十五日，我吃过早饭以后和副支队长、副政委、参谋长、主任他们一起听了宪法草案的广播。当时，我记得最清楚的是“中华人民共和国的武装力量属于人民，它的任务是保卫人民革命和国家建设的成果，保卫国家的安全和领土主权的完整。”听后我就默默地想：这是一个多么庄严多么伟大多么光荣的任务！过几天，“人民日报”来了，我就反复地把宪法草案看了几遍，又反复学习了第二十条的内容。接着，我又学了志愿军领导机关关于宣传和讨论宪法草案的指示文件。通过这些学习，使我深深地感到自己责任的重大。因为，这个不久就要在全国人民代表大会会议上讨论通过颁布施行的国家根本大法，每一字每一条都是维护劳动人民的利益的。它不但把我国人民革命的成果巩固下来了，还要动员和组织全国人民过渡到社会主义社会去。但是，帝国主义者和国内的反革命分子必然千方百计地破坏我们的事业，宪法草案上也明确规定着要“镇压一切叛国的和反革命的活动，惩办一切卖国贼和反革命分子。”不久以前，在总路线的学习中，已使我十分明白了这一点。我国人民奋斗了一百多年，在党和毛主席的领导下才建立了我们自己的国家。多少同志流尽了鲜血，多少人民牺牲了生命。不说别的，就像可敬的杨根思同志，就在抗美援朝的前线献出了他英雄的生命。在我亲自参加的上甘岭战役中，同志们一想到“五圣山后通北京”，就都奋勇向前，不少同志壮烈牺牲了。宪法，它是多少同志多少人民用血汗换来的结晶；实现社会主义，又是全国广大人民的愿望。我是一个中华人民共和国的公民，又是一个志愿军的战士，遵守宪法，保证宪法的实施，就是我最神圣的责任。
