    Supply and Marketing Cooperatives Must Implement the Policy of Serving Agricultural Production

    The First National Congress of Cooperatives of China has successfully concluded. In accordance with the requirements of the general task of the state during the transition period, the meeting reviewed and summarized the work of the past four years, affirmed the achievements, criticized the shortcomings, determined the basic tasks of the supply and marketing cooperatives during the transition period, adopted the articles of association of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives, and elected the central leading organs and supervisory organs of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives. The work of cooperatives throughout the country will be greatly advanced in the future.

    The cooperative cause occupies an important position and role in my country's entire national economy. It is an important organization that uses the spirit of collectivism to organize mass economic activities and conduct socialist education for the masses. In the five years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, under the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China and the Central People's Government, and thanks to the joint efforts of all cooperative workers, my country's cooperative cause has developed unprecedentedly. From 1950 to 1953, the number of members of supply and marketing cooperatives increased from 20 million to more than 160 million, retail sales and procurement increased more than tenfold, and owned capital increased 19 and a half times. The 132,000 fixed retail stores and 35,000 mobile retail outlets of the supply and marketing cooperatives are scattered throughout the country. In the vast rural areas, supply and marketing cooperatives occupy an important position in commodity circulation. In 1953, the amount of means of production supplied to rural areas was equal to 30 times that of 1950. In recent years, supply and marketing cooperatives have played a significant role in the rapid recovery and development of the national economy, especially in the rapid recovery and development of agriculture; they have become a strong assistant to state-owned commerce in stabilizing prices and developing urban-rural material exchanges. It supplies a large amount of means of production and livelihood, reduces intermediate exploitation by private merchants, and has become an indispensable economic organization for the working people. It has consolidated and expanded the leading force of the socialist economy, reduced the position of capitalist commerce in rural areas, and promoted the development of rural mutual assistance and cooperation, thereby also helping to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance.

    During the transition period, the basic tasks of the supply and marketing cooperatives are: 1. To develop urban-rural material exchanges through supply and marketing operations, to serve agricultural production, to support national industrialization, and to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance; 2. To guide the small-scale peasant economy and individual handicraft industry to gradually incorporate into the orbit of the national plan, and to promote their socialist transformation in accordance with the national plan and price policy, through the contract system and planned supply and marketing operations; 3. Under the leadership of state-owned commercial leading organs, expand the organized commodity circulation, lead the rural market, gradually realize the transformation of rural private merchants, and replace the position of capitalist commerce in rural areas, and gradually cut off the connection between farmers and urban capitalism. These three basic tasks are closely related and interact with each other, and its central link is to promote the development of the rural mutual assistance and cooperation movement and serve agricultural production.

    The main component of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives is the rural supply and marketing cooperative, and more than 90% of its members are farmers. Therefore, the basic policy of the work of the supply and marketing cooperatives must be to serve agricultural production and promote the development of the rural mutual assistance and cooperation movement. Only by firmly grasping this central link, doing a good job in the supply of means of production and livelihood in rural areas, and doing a good job in the procurement of agricultural, sideline, and local specialty products, can we stimulate the production enthusiasm of farmers, promote the development of rural productive forces, and, on the one hand, produce more commodity grain, industrial raw materials, and export goods for the country, and ensure the agricultural and sideline products needed for the industrial construction of our country and the people in urban industrial and mining areas. On the other hand, on the basis of the improvement of agricultural production, it can improve the purchasing power of farmers, improve the lives of farmers, expand the market for industrial products, and support the country's industrial construction. Only by firmly grasping this central link can the supply and marketing cooperatives further consolidate and expand their commercial position in rural areas, gradually cut off the connection between capitalism and rural areas, curb the spontaneous development of rural capitalism, and, through organized and planned urban-rural material exchanges, gradually link the scattered small-scale peasant economy and individual handicraft industry with the national plan, and promote their socialist transformation.

    That is to say, the work of supply and marketing cooperatives is not only an economic work, but also an important political work. Doing this work well will help smoothly attract farmers to the socialist construction cause and consolidate the worker-peasant alliance; it will powerfully promote the victorious advancement of our country's socialist construction cause. All comrades working in cooperatives must recognize their important responsibilities, work hard, and shoulder the glorious task.

    At present, many cadres of supply and marketing cooperatives have not resolutely implemented the policy of serving agricultural production, and still have capitalist management ideas, which seriously hinders the further development of supply and marketing cooperatives. Some supply and marketing cooperatives only attach importance to the supply of means of livelihood, but neglect the supply of means of production; in terms of the supply of means of production, they only pay attention to the supply of chemical fertilizers and soybean cake, but do not actively supply the old-fashioned farm tools, miscellaneous fertilizers, especially the new-style farm tools, pesticides, agricultural machinery, and waterwheels that the organized farmers urgently need. Some supply and marketing cooperatives only operate large-city industrial products and large-volume native products and specialties with higher profits or easier operation, but are unwilling to actively operate handicraft products and small native products with lower profits or more difficult operation but needed for the production and life of the majority of farmers. In some places, there are also phenomena of upper-level cooperatives and lower-level cooperatives, and cooperatives in producing areas and sales areas competing for business with each other, concealing or falsely reporting costs. This kind of management policy and management thinking are very wrong. It should be understood that supply and marketing cooperatives are socialist economic organizations, and they have an essential difference from capitalist commerce. They must be commerce that serves the needs of agricultural production and farmers' lives, and commerce that serves the national socialist industrialization. Cooperative workers must strive to eradicate the existing serious shortcomings in the business of cooperatives and strive to better realize their basic tasks.

    In order to implement the policy of serving agricultural production, supply and marketing cooperatives in various places must improve on the existing basis and actively develop supply and marketing operations. The primary task at present is to vigorously do a good job in the planned procurement and planned supply entrusted by the state, actively open up local sources of goods, and further expand urban-rural material exchanges. The planned procurement and planned supply of grain, edible oil, and oil crops implemented by the state since last winter has proved that this is an effective and important measure to stabilize the lives of the broad masses of people and the national economy. Supply and marketing cooperatives in various places have also played a great role in completing this important task entrusted by the state. However, the planned procurement and planned supply work is, after all, a new work, and we still lack experience. The scope of planned procurement and planned supply is gradually expanding. Therefore, supply and marketing cooperatives in various places must quickly and practically summarize the current fragmented experience into systematic experience in order to correctly implement the planned procurement and planned supply policy and strive to further improve the planned procurement and planned supply. Of course, supply and marketing cooperatives must also do a good job in the procurement and supply of other materials, especially strengthening the supply of means of production such as farm tools, fertilizers, seeds, livestock, and feed, and actively organizing local farm tool factories and handicraft producers to use local materials and process them locally to tap the potential production power of the locality. In terms of the supply of means of livelihood, it is necessary to guarantee the main commodities needed for the lives of the members, and gradually increase the types of commodities according to the increase in the purchasing power of the members and farmers and the operating capacity of the cooperatives.

    In order to carry out rural procurement and supply work in a planned manner and promote the development of the mutual assistance and cooperation movement, supply and marketing cooperatives should actively and steadily promote pre-purchase contracts and combined contracts. Through these contracts, the agricultural economy of small-scale production is indirectly incorporated into the national planned economy, promoting the increase in the production of grain, cotton, and oil crops to meet the needs of national industrialization and strengthen the planned nature of the business of supply and marketing cooperatives.

    Supply and marketing cooperatives must also further improve business management. At present, supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels in various places have great blindness in business operations, poor planning and organization of procurement and supply, unreasonable labor organization, poor operating technology, chaotic assets, excessive proportion of non-production expenditures, failure to pay attention to reasonable accumulation, and some operating losses. These phenomena are serious. If they are not changed quickly, supply and marketing cooperatives cannot be consolidated and developed. The central key to improving the operation of supply and marketing cooperatives is to strengthen investigation and research work, systematically understand the needs of the masses, strengthen business planning, and gradually implement the economic accounting system. In management, it is necessary to implement the policy of democratic management, strengthen the role of democratic supervision, and supply and marketing cooperatives can only be run well by relying on the supervision of the masses and relying on democratic management. The operating business of cooperatives at all levels must absorb directors to participate in democratic discussions, give play to the active supervisory role of supervisors, hold member representative meetings regularly, summarize the work of the cooperatives, publicize accounts, report profits and losses, and promote the enthusiasm of the members and the masses to run the cooperatives well.

    Party committees in various places must strengthen their leadership over supply and marketing cooperatives. First of all, they must strengthen the specific leadership of district committees over supply and marketing cooperatives. This is a decisive link in improving the work of grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives at present. In the overall work of leading agricultural transformation, party committees in various places must put the work of supply and marketing cooperatives in an appropriate position and give full play to the role of supply and marketing cooperatives as economic organizations of a socialist nature. Cooperatives at all levels should also take the initiative to report situations to the party committees, request instructions, and strive for the leadership of the party committees. The political work of supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels must be strengthened, and we must seize the learning of cooperative cadres, constantly improve their political consciousness and class consciousness, so that they can deeply realize the political significance of each task they undertake for the entire cooperative cause and the country's socialist transformation cause, thereby highly exerting their enthusiasm and creativity; pay attention to listening to the opinions of the masses at all times, educate and persuade the masses, strive to improve their work, strictly prevent coercive orders and bureaucratic work style; prevent conservative views and complacency in business operations, and ensure the realization of work tasks.

    供销合作社必须贯彻为农业生产服务的方针
    中华全国合作社第一次代表大会胜利地闭幕了。会议根据国家过渡时期总任务的要求，检查和总结了四年来的工作，肯定了成绩，批判了缺点，确定了供销合作社在过渡时期的基本任务，通过了中华全国供销合作总社的章程，选出了中华全国合作社的中央领导机关和监察机关。全国各地合作社的工作今后将大大前进一步。
    合作事业在我国整个国民经济中有着重要的地位和作用，它是用集体主义的精神组织群众经济活动并对群众进行社会主义教育的重要组织。在中华人民共和国成立以来的五年中，在中国共产党和中央人民政府的正确领导下，由于全体合作社工作者的共同努力，我国合作事业有了空前的发展。从一九五○年到一九五三年，供销合作社的社员由两千万人增加到一亿六千多万人，零售额和收购额都增加了十倍以上，自有资金增加了十九倍半。供销合作社的十三万两千多个固定零售店和三万五千多个流动零售点，散布在全国各地；在广大的农村中，供销合作社在商品流通中更占着重要地位。一九五三年供应给农村的生产资料，其数量等于一九五○年的三十倍。几年来，供销合作社对国民经济的迅速恢复和发展，特别是对于农业的迅速恢复和发展起了显著的作用；在稳定物价和开展城乡物资交流中已成了国营商业的有力助手。它大量供应生产和生活资料，减除私商中间剥削，成为劳动人民不可缺少的经济组织。它巩固和扩大了社会主义经济的领导力量，缩小了资本主义商业在农村的阵地，促进了农村互助合作的发展，从而也有助于工农联盟的巩固。
    在过渡时期，供销合作社的基本任务是：一、通过供销业务，开展城乡物资交流，为农业生产服务，以支援国家工业化，并巩固工农联盟；二、根据国家计划和价格政策，通过合同制度和有计划的供销业务，引导小农经济和个体手工业逐步纳入国家计划的轨道，并促进其社会主义改造；三、在国营商业领导机关的领导下，扩大有组织的商品流转，领导农村市场，逐步实现对农村私商的改造，并代替资本主义商业在农村的阵地，逐步切断农民与城市资本主义的联系。这三个基本任务是密切联系、互相作用的，而它的中心环节则是促进农村互助合作运动的发展，为农业生产服务。
    中华全国合作社的主要组成部分是农村供销合作社，社员的百分之九十以上是农民。因此供销合作社工作的基本方针必须是为农业生产服务，促进农村互助合作运动的发展。只有紧紧抓住这一中心环节，做好农村生产资料和生活资料的供应，做好农副土特产品的收购，才能激发农民的生产积极性，促进农村生产力的发展，一方面为国家生产出更多的商品粮食、工业原料、出口物资，保证我国工业建设和城市工矿区人民所需要的农业和副业产品。另一方面，在农业生产提高的基础上，才能提高农民的购买力，改善农民的生活，扩大工业品市场，支援国家的工业建设。也只有紧紧抓住这一中心环节，供销合作社才能进一步地巩固和扩大在农村的商业阵地，并逐步切断资本主义和农村的联系，遏止农村资本主义自发势力的发展，并且通过有组织有计划的城乡物资交流，使分散的小农经济和个体手工业逐步与国家计划联结起来，促进其社会主义改造。
    这就是说，供销合作社的工作，不只是一项经济工作，而且是一项重要的政治工作。做好了这项工作，就有助于顺利地把农民吸引到社会主义建设事业上来，巩固工农联盟；就能有力地推进我国社会主义建设事业的胜利前进。一切合作社工作的同志，必须认清自己的重大责任，努力工作，担负起光荣的任务。
    目前还有不少的供销合作社干部没有坚决地贯彻为农业生产服务的方针，还存在着资本主义的经营思想，这就严重阻碍了供销合作社的进一步发展。有的供销合作社，只重视供应生活资料，而忽视供应生产资料；在生产资料供应方面，也只注意化学肥料和豆饼的供应，而对广大农民需要的旧式农具、杂肥，特别是组织起来的农民所迫切需要的新式农具、农药、农械和水车等，却不积极供应。有的供销合作社，只经营利润较高或比较容易经营的大城市工业品和大宗土产特产，而对利润较小或经营比较困难但为广大农民生产和生活所需要的手工业产品及小土产则不愿积极经营。有的地方，上级社和下级社、产地与销地合作社之间，还有互争业务，隐瞒或虚报成本的现象。这种经营方针和经营思想都是十分错误的。应该了解，供销合作社是社会主义经济组织，它和资本主义商业有着本质的区别，它必须是为农业生产和农民生活需要服务的商业，为国家社会主义工业化服务的商业。合作社工作者都必须努力根除合作社业务中的现有的严重缺点，更好地为实现自己的基本任务而奋斗。
    为了贯彻为农业生产服务的方针，各地供销合作社必须在现有基础上提高一步，积极地发展供销业务。当前首要的任务，就是大力做好国家委托的计划收购和计划供应工作，积极开辟地方货源，进一步扩大城乡物资交流。国家自去年冬天实行的粮食和食油、油料作物的计划收购计划供应工作，已经证明了这是行之有效的安定广大人民生活与国家经济的重要措施。各地供销合作社在完成国家委托的这一重要任务中，也起了很大的作用，但是，计划收购和计划供应工作毕竟是一件新的工作，我们还很缺乏经验，而计划收购和计划供应的范围又正逐渐扩大，所以，各地供销合作社必须迅速地切实地把现在的片断经验，总结成为系统的经验，以便正确贯彻计划收购计划供应的政策，为进一步做好计划收购计划供应而努力。当然，供销合作社也还要做好其它物资的收购和供应工作，特别是要大力加强农具、肥料、籽种、牲畜、饲料等生产资料的供应工作，积极组织当地农具工厂和手工业生产者就地取材、就地加工，发掘当地生产潜在力量。在生活资料供应方面，要保证社员生活需要的主要商品，并根据社员和农民购买力提高的情况和合作社的经营能力，逐步增多商品种类。
    为了有计划地进行农村收购和供应工作，促进互助合作运动的发展，供销合作社应积极稳步地推广预购合同和结合合同；通过这些合同，吸引广大小生产的农业经济间接地纳入国家计划经济轨道，促进粮食、棉花和油料作物的增产，以适应国家工业化的需要，加强供销合作社业务中的计划性。
    供销合作社还必须进一步改善经营管理。目前各地各级供销合作社在业务经营上盲目性很大，收购和供应的计划性和组织性很差，劳动组织不合理，经营技术差，资财混乱，非生产开支比例过高，不注意合理积累，有的经营亏损，这些现象是严重的，如不迅速改变，供销合作社就不能巩固和发展。改善供销合作社经营的中心关键，就是要加强调查研究工作，系统了解群众需要，加强经营计划性，逐步推行经济核算制。在管理上必须贯彻民主管理的方针，加强民主监督的作用，供销合作社只有依靠群众的监督，依靠民主管理才能办好。各级合作社的经营业务必须吸收理事参加民主讨论，发挥监事积极的监察作用；定期召开社员代表大会，总结合作社工作、公布账目、报告盈亏，发扬社员群众的积极性，把合作社办好。
    各地党委必须加强对供销合作社的领导，首先要加强区委对供销合作社的具体领导，这是目前提高基层供销合作社工作的有决定性的一环。各地党委在领导农业改造的全面工作中，要把供销合作社的工作摆到恰当的位置上来，很好地发挥供销合作社这个社会主义性质的经济组织的作用；各级合作社更要主动地向党委反映情况，请求指示，争取党委的领导。各级供销合作社的政治工作必须加强，要抓紧合作社干部的学习，不断提高他们的政治觉悟和阶级觉悟，使他们深刻认识到他们所担负的每项工作任务对于整个合作事业以及国家的社会主义改造事业的政治意义，从而高度发挥他们的积极性和创造性；时刻注意倾听群众意见，教育说服群众，努力改进工作，严防强迫命令和官僚主义作风；防止业务经营上的保守观点和自满情绪，保证工作任务的实现。
