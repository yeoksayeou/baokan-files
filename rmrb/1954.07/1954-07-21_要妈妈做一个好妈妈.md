    In the mind of Che Yongming, a student at East China Normal University, there is a beautiful picture of the future of the motherland – a socialist society. He requires himself to "dedicate his precious youth and life entirely to it." As early as April, when the school asked him to fill out the graduate registration form, the first sentence he wrote was: unconditional obedience to unified allocation. How he longed to add his own bit of strength to the great socialist construction of the motherland! As for where to be assigned, the Southwest, Northwest, Northeast... anywhere would do, he would go wherever he was needed.

    However, Che Yongming's mother did not think so. She placed all her hopes for her later years on her two sons. Now, her eldest son was about to graduate from university, and she was so happy. But when she heard that her son might be assigned to work in an unfamiliar place, her mood became heavy. She had written several letters to Che Yongming in a row, trying to touch her son's heart, hoping that he could stay in the East China region to work.

    When Che Yongming received the first letter from his mother, he felt a little uneasy. His mother was getting old, and she so hoped that her son could live by her side and give her some care. But how could he imagine not obeying the interests of the country for his personal interests!

    Che Yongming was already a member of the Chinese Communist Party. He understood that a party member should subordinate personal interests to the interests of the Party. Of course, he could not accommodate his mother's thinking. However, he loved his mother, and he could not go against his mother's wishes. He thought: as a Communist Party member, a youth of New China, what is the true way to love his mother? She didn't want him to leave the Jiangnan region, and she also had the thought of being afraid of him suffering hardships in other places. He could not love her for such selfish psychology. But he knew that she was also patriotic. From her recent letters, he knew that she had also studied the general task of the country during the transition period. He believed that she could be persuaded. He was determined to make her a good mother of New China. In addition, he also thought about his mother's livelihood. He decided that if he could not bring her to live together in the short term, he would try to save money to help her solve her living expenses. He wrote these thoughts to his mother in detail.

    Sure enough, his mother's letters became less frequent, and the tone became more gentle. However, she had not completely given up her demands. In early July, after the exams were over, Che Yongming took three days off during the gap before the unified allocation to go home once. When he got home, his mother was in tears at first. Che Yongming told her many stories about the socialist construction that the country was carrying out, about the changes in the appearance of his hometown, and about the future of the motherland. The expression on his mother's face gradually became less unhappy. He then carefully talked to his mother about the arrangements for their future life. She finally agreed, saying: "Then, do as you please! If you are assigned to work far away, write more letters; if you are assigned closer, come home more often."

    Three days later, Che Yongming returned to school with a relaxed and happy mood.

    “要妈妈做一个好妈妈”
     新华社记者　郑伯亚
    华东师范大学学生车永明的脑海里，有一幅关于祖国的未来——社会主义社会的美丽图画。他要求自己“把宝贵的青春和生命全部贡献给它”。早在四月间，学校里要他填毕业生登记表的时候，他写上的第一句话就是：无条件地服从统一分配。他是多么渴望着能在祖国伟大的社会主义建设中加进自己的一点力量啊！至于分配到那里去，西南、西北、东北……那儿都可以，那儿需要就到那儿去。
    可是，车永明的妈妈却不这样想。她把晚年的希望全部寄托在两个儿子身上了。现在，大儿子快要在大学毕业了，她多么高兴。但是，听到儿子也许要分配到人地生疏的外地去工作时，她的心绪就沉重起来。她曾一连写了好几封信给车永明，想来打动儿子的心，希望他能留在华东地区工作。
    车永明接到他妈妈第一封信的时候，心里着实有点忐忑不安。他的妈妈年纪大了，她多么盼望儿子能生活在她的身边，能给她一些照顾。可是，他又怎么能设想自己为着个人的利益而不去服从国家的利益呢！
    车永明已经是一个中国共产党党员了。他是了解党员应该把个人利益服从于党的利益的。当然，他不能迁就他妈妈的思想。然而，他是爱他的妈妈的，他也不能违背他妈妈的心意。他想：一个共产党员，新中国的青年，怎样才算是真正地爱他的妈妈呢？她不愿他离开江南，还有怕他到外地去吃苦的思想在内，他不能爱她这样的自私心理。但他知道她也是爱国的。从她最近的来信中，知道她也学过国家在过渡时期的总任务。他相信她是可以说服的。他决心要使她成为一个新中国的好妈妈。另外，他也想到他妈妈的生活问题。他决定如果短期内不能把她带到一起住的话，就尽量节约帮助她解决生活费用。他把这些想法详细地写信告诉了他的妈妈。
    果然，他妈妈的来信少了，语气也缓和一些了。但是，还没有完全放弃她的要求。七月初，车永明在考试结束以后，乘着还没有统一分配的空隙，抽出三天时间，回家一次。到家了，开始时，他妈妈流着眼泪。车永明对她讲了许多国家正在进行的社会主义建设的故事，讲到故乡面貌的改变，讲到祖国的未来。他妈妈的脸上渐渐地不再那么不高兴了。他又仔细地向他妈妈谈到关于他们今后生活的安排。她终于同意了，她说：“那么，随你吧！如果工作分配得远，要多来几封信；分配得近，要多回来看我几次。”
    三天后，车永明带着轻松愉快的心情，回到了学校。
