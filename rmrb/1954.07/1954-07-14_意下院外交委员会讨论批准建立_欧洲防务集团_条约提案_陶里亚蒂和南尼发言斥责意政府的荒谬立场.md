Xinhua News Agency, Rome, July 10th: “Unità” published a detailed account of the Italian Lower House Foreign Affairs Committee meeting on July 9th to discuss the proposal to ratify the treaty establishing the "European Defense Community."

After the speech by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Piccioni, a debate ensued. Speakers in the debate included Contarucci, a monarchist member of parliament, Anfuso, a neo-fascist member of parliament, Nenni, the General Secretary of the Socialist Party, and Togliatti, the General Secretary of the Communist Party. The two representatives of the right-wing parties advocated postponing the discussion of this issue "pending clarification of the situation."

Nenni said that it is absurd for the government to stubbornly want to ratify the treaty on establishing the "European Defense Community." Now it seems that France is prepared to carefully study the policy that the "European Defense Community" was originally intended to serve as a tool for. In this situation, the government cannot insist on its own position on this issue. Once this "group" is established, the hope of reaching a genuine peace agreement among all European peoples will disappear.

Togliatti opposed the government's insistence on a speedy discussion of the treaty. He also criticized the position of the extreme right-wing parties. Togliatti said that we Communists oppose the establishment of military blocs and the policy of arming Germany for aggression. But we cannot limit ourselves to declaring this view and waiting for other parties to believe in the correctness of this view. We are raising a question that those who are in charge of Italian foreign policy should answer. Have you noticed that countries and political parties around the world are looking for international policy options that are different from the "European Defense Community"? Among those seeking such options are the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies, and, to be honest, France and Britain as well, albeit in different ways. Have you noticed this? In this situation, we cannot just wait, but must intervene to formulate new plans and make contributions, new plans that do not pose a threat to the security and peace of all peoples. The question is not about accelerating or delaying the ratification of the treaty on establishing the "European Defense Community." The question is about enabling Italy to actively enter a new stage of international policy. This stage is characterized by everyone's demand for easing international tensions.

    意下院外交委员会讨论批准建立“欧洲防务集团”条约提案
    陶里亚蒂和南尼发言斥责意政府的荒谬立场
   【新华社十二日讯】据塔斯社罗马十日讯：“团结报”刊载了意大利下院外交委员会七月九日会议讨论批准建立“欧洲防务集团”条约的提案的详细情形。
    在外交部部长皮齐阿尼发言后就展开了辩论。在辩论中发言的有保皇党议员康塔鲁波、新法西斯党议员安夫佐、社会党总书记南尼、共产党总书记陶里亚蒂等。右翼党的两个代表主张延期讨论这个问题“以待局势的澄清”。
    南尼说，政府顽固地要想批准关于建立“欧洲防务集团”条约，这是很荒谬的。现在看来，法国已准备慎重地研究本来将以“欧洲防务集团”作为工具的政策，在这种情况下，政府是不能在这个问题上坚持己见的。这个“集团”一旦建立，所有欧洲国家人民之间达成真正的和平的协议的希望就会消失了。
    陶里亚蒂反对政府坚持从速讨论条约的主张。他同时抨击了极端右翼的党派的立场。陶里亚蒂说，我们共产党人反对建立军事集团和武装德国以实行侵略的政策。但是我们不能仅限于宣布这种观点及等待其他党派相信这种观点的正确性。我们向主持意大利外交政策的人提出一个他们应当回答的问题。你们有没有觉察到，世界上各个国家和政治党派正在多方寻找与“欧洲防务集团”不同的国际政策方案？在寻求这种方案的既有苏联和人民民主国家，而且，老实说一句，还有法国和英国，只不过方式不同罢了，这点你们觉察到没有？在这种情况下不能仅限于等待，而且必须干预拟定新的方案并作出贡献，这种新方案要不致对各国人民的安全与和平造成威胁。问题并不在于加速或延迟批准关于建立“欧洲防务集团”的条约。问题在于应使意大利积极地进入国际政策的新阶段。这一阶段的特点就是大家都要求缓和国际局势。
