    Since Liberation, many new houses have been built in the Beijing area. To date, the completed area of newly built houses is equal to 39% of the original housing area of Beijing. If the projects under construction are included, the houses built by the end of 1954 will be approximately equal to one-half of the original housing area. According to statistics from the end of 1953, workers', staff members', and citizens' residences account for the largest proportion of these newly built houses, accounting for 36.3% of the total construction area; factories account for 9.3%; and school buildings for primary, middle, and high schools account for 15.5%.

    Outside Xizhimen, the magnificent Soviet Exhibition Center and its ancillary projects are being rushed to completion, and are expected to be fully completed in September.

    Southwest of Yuetan outside Fuchengmen, many office buildings, some as high as nine and seven stories, are successively beginning construction.

    In the East Suburb Industrial Zone, the Jingxi Mining Area, Changxindian in the South Suburb, Fengtai District, and other factories and mines, many have been completed. For example, Beijing No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory, Beijing Garment Factory, Central Institute of Metrology, and Beijing Winery have all been built, and the Beijing No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory is now under construction.

    The large-scale cultural and educational area on both sides of the Xi (zhimen) Yi (heyuan) Highway and the De (shengmen) Qing (he) Highway, which includes colleges such as those for iron and steel, mining, aviation, geology, petroleum, agriculture, and forestry, as well as Beijing Institute of Technology and Beijing Medical College, are mostly completed. The large-scale All-China Federation of Trade Unions Cadre School and the Sports Institute are under construction.

    In the city and in areas with beautiful scenery, many hospitals and sanatoriums are constantly appearing, including the Soviet Red Cross Hospital, Children's Hospital, Tongren Hospital, Xiaotangshan Sanatorium, and the Asian Student Sanatorium.

    In addition to the four theaters and cinemas that have already been built in Tianqiao, Longfusi, Jiaodaokou, and Xinjiekou, the large-scale Capital Theater has officially started construction. In addition, workers' clubs have been built in the Xisi and Haidian districts.

    After Liberation, a large number of hotels and guesthouses were built and expanded, including the larger Beijing Hotel, International Hotel, and Xinqiao Hotel. There are also eight hotels built by the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Commerce specifically for accommodating staff members from all over the country and general travelers staying in Beijing, and the Municipal Cooperative General Agency has opened four farmer's guesthouses in Guanxiang for farmers to live in.

    On a wide expanse of land east of Ditan in the northern suburbs, a new residential area composed of 126 buildings was completed last year. This year, large dormitories for various universities and central ministries, generally four- and five-story buildings, are being built in the western suburbs and other places.

    首都新建房屋迅速增加
    解放以来，北京地区新建了很多房屋。到目前为止，已经竣工的新建房屋面积等于北京市原有房屋面积的百分之三十九，如果连正在施工建设的工程计算在内，到一九五四年年底止建成的房屋约等于原有房屋面积的二分之一。根据一九五三年年底的统计，这些修建房屋中以工人、职员和市民的住宅最多，占建筑总面积的百分之三十六点三；工厂占百分之九点三；高、中、小学校舍占百分之十五点五。
    在西直门外，规模宏伟的苏联展览馆及其附属工程正在赶修中，预计在九月份即可全部完工。
  在阜成门外月坛西南，许多高达九层、七层的办公大楼正在陆续开工兴建。
    在东郊工业区、京西矿区、南郊长辛店、丰台区等不少厂矿已修建完工。如北京第一棉纺织厂、北京被服厂、中央度量衡厂、北京酿酒厂等都已建成，现在正在兴建北京第二棉纺织厂。
    西（直门）颐（和园）公路和德（胜门）清
  （河）公路两侧规模宏大的文化教育区，其中包括钢铁、矿业、航空、地质、石油、农业、林业等学院和北京工业学院、北京医学院等工程，大部分已经完工。规模宏大的中华全国总工会干部学校、体育学院等正在修建中。
    在城内和风景优美的地区，许多医院、疗养院不断出现，其中包括苏联红十字医院、儿童医院、同仁医院、小汤山疗养院和亚洲学生疗养院等。
    北京市除了已在天桥、隆福寺、交道口、新街口等地方建设四处剧院和电影院外，规模宏大的首都剧场已正式开工。另外，还在西四和海淀两区建筑了工人俱乐部。
    解放后兴建和扩建了大批旅馆和招待所，有规模较大的北京饭店、国际饭店、新侨饭店等。还有北京市商业局专为招待各地来京的工作人员和一般旅客住宿的八座旅馆，市合作总社在关厢开办了四个供农民居住的农民招待所。
    在北郊地坛以东的一片宽阔的土地上，去年已建成了一百二十六幢大楼组成的新住宅区。今年正在西郊等地建筑的有各大学院和中央各部的大宿舍，一般都是四、五层的大楼。
