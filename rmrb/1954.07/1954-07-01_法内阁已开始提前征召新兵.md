    Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 30th dispatch: The French cabinet held its first meeting on June 28th after the formation of the Mendès France government.
    The cabinet listened to Mendès France's report, which discussed the international situation from the perspective of the Churchill-Eisenhower Washington talks and the negotiations to restore peace in Indochina. The director of the Prime Minister's Office, Betencourt, said that the cabinet had agreed to take the first batch of measures to "accelerate the reinforcement of the Far East Expeditionary Force" and agreed to take measures to strengthen the French forces stationed in North Africa.
    Accordingly, the cabinet meeting decided to request the National Assembly to approve the decision made by the Laniel government on June 4 to conscript new recruits early.
    "L'Humanité" commented that although the parliament had not yet approved the decision, the early conscription of new recruits had already begun on June 28. "L'Humanité" emphasized: "It can be seen that although Mendès France has repeatedly stated that he hopes to achieve peace in Indochina, he has approved the previous government's 'severe measures.' Are these measures to promote negotiations? Are these measures a step forward on the road to peace? Of course not!"

    法内阁已开始提前征召新兵
   【新华社三十日讯】塔斯社巴黎讯：孟戴斯—弗朗斯政府组成后，法国内阁在六月二十八日举行第一次会议。
    内阁听取了孟戴斯—弗朗斯的报告，这个报告从邱吉尔—艾森豪威尔的华盛顿会谈以及恢复印度支那和平的谈判的角度论述了国际形势。总理办公厅主任贝登古说，内阁已经同意采取第一批措施来“加速对远东远征军的增援”，并同意采取措施加强驻北非的法军。
    内阁会议据此决定提请国民议会批准拉尼埃政府在六月四日所作出的提前征召新兵的决定。
    “人道报”评论说，虽然议会还没有批准这个决定，提前征召新兵在六月二十八日就已经开始了。“人道报”着重指出：“可见，虽然孟戴斯—弗朗斯一再表明他希望在印度支那实现和平，他却赞成前政府的‘严峻措施’。这些措施是为了促进谈判吗？这些措施是在和平道路上前进的一步吗？当然不是的！”
