How We Cultivate Cadres in the Mutual Aid and Cooperation Movement
Zhang Yugang, Secretary of the Fourth District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Raoyang, Hebei

Our district has developed 355 agricultural production cooperatives. More than 6,100 peasant households participate in the cooperatives, accounting for 42 percent of the total number of households in the district, of which 80 percent of the cooperatives are run very well. Various types of mutual aid teams have also developed to more than 1,000, with more than 3,000 peasant households participating, accounting for more than 20 percent of the total number of households in the district. The reason we have been able to achieve these results is inseparable from the District Committee's attention to the work of cultivating mutual aid and cooperation cadres. At present, there are more than 1,000 cadres in our district engaged in mutual aid and cooperation work. Under the District Committee's planned training, their leadership level has been greatly improved. Among the 22 district cadres, 8 have become skilled in running cooperatives, and the rest have been able to handle general issues that arise in the cooperatives. Among the cadres in the townships and cooperatives, they generally understand the policies of mutual aid and cooperation and are initially familiar with the business management of agricultural production cooperatives. Many of them have been able to run cooperatives independently. These cadres are not only a guarantee for consolidating the existing agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams, but also a leading force for further developing the cooperative movement.

The District Committee began to pay attention to cultivating cadres for mutual aid and cooperation work in 1952. At that time, with the rapid development of agricultural production cooperatives in the district (from 4 to 80), a noteworthy issue was raised: that leading cadres should keep up with the development of agricultural production cooperatives. Many district cadres lacked the knowledge to run cooperatives, and many problems raised by the cooperatives could not be solved. Therefore, some cadres were afraid to go to villages with cooperatives to work. Cadres of grass-roots organizations also did not pay enough attention to leading the cooperative movement, and pushed everything to the District Committee, making the District Committee overwhelmed. This situation, where leadership could not keep up with the development of the movement, caused the cooperative movement in the district to appear disorganized. Later, three cooperatives disintegrated, and eight cooperatives nearly collapsed. When this serious situation was presented to the District Committee, the District Committee decided that each member should go to each cooperative in a timely manner to help solve the problems. However, relying only on a few members of the District Committee could not solve many problems. At this time, the District Committee deeply felt that to change this situation, it was necessary to actively improve the ability of existing district and township cadres to lead the cooperative movement; at the same time, attention should be paid to cultivating grass-roots cadres.

Go to Actual Work

The experience of the past two years has proven that the most fundamental and effective method for cultivating cadres for mutual aid and cooperation work is to put cadres into actual work to train them. The District Committee vigorously called on district and township cadres and grass-roots Party organizations to work together to run agricultural production cooperatives. The district cadres implemented a system of dividing areas and contracting tasks, and the township and cooperative cadres implemented a system of dividing work and contracting cooperatives, teams, and groups. At that time, clear requirements were put forward for district cadres: first, to help agricultural production cooperatives formulate a practical production plan; second, to help agricultural production cooperatives solve various problems that occur in the production process; third, to bring back the experience of running cooperatives. At the beginning of the work, many cadres still had resistant thoughts: some said, "The problems of agricultural cooperatives are not as easy to solve as the problems in other work." Some said, "Being a cooperative director is not as good as being a township head." Some also said, "If you become a cooperative cadre, you will die three years earlier." The District Committee studied these ideological situations and pointed out to the vast number of district and township cadres that as long as everyone worked hard to learn, they would quickly change from "laymen" to "experts." The method of learning was to learn from all "experts" (district cadres, township cadres, and agricultural production cooperative directors with experience in running cooperatives); on the other hand, cadres who could overcome difficulties and actively learn the experience of running cooperatives were commended and role models were established. The District Committee used the example of district assistant Zhang Tiechui learning to run a cooperative to educate district cadres; and used the examples of Geng Changsuo, Song Quandao, who originally were illiterate, and Wang Guiyan, a woman raising three children, successfully acting as cooperative directors, to educate all township and cooperative cadres. The cadres' fear of difficulties began to dissipate, and they started working. After district cadre Liu Changshan was assigned to contract the cooperatives in Guocun Township, he did not know how to implement the contracting work system, so he ran three times to Jin Wenhuan's cooperative, three miles away, to learn the experience of contracting work. Deputy District Chief Han Jinke did not dare to go to the cooperative last year, but this year he actively went deep into the cooperative to learn. He said, "To change from a layman to an expert, you have to do it yourself." Rural cadres also took the initiative. After the village cadres of Zoucun implemented the system of dividing work and contracting cooperatives, they strengthened collective leadership, and when problems occurred in the work, they jointly studied and resolved them. Due to the influence of female cooperative director Wang Guiyan, eighteen female cooperative directors emerged throughout the district this year, and they led the agricultural production cooperatives in the same way as men, and led them very well.

Skilled People Lead Novices

After the district and township cadres implemented the system of everyone starting, dividing responsibilities, the cadres' sense of responsibility was strengthened and their work enthusiasm was high. At this time, on the one hand, it was necessary for the cadres to work hard to learn in actual work, and on the other hand, it was also necessary for the leadership to take effective measures to help the cadres learn to run cooperatives. The method adopted by the District Committee in this regard was: skilled people lead novices.

Among the district cadres, the leading cadres first led the general cadres. There were two ways to lead: first, the leading cadres went deep into key areas to create experience and then taught it to the general cadres. For example, last year, many cooperatives had serious problems with wasted labor because of poor labor allocation, and the district and township cadres could not solve it. The District Committee Secretary went deep into Song Quandao's cooperative (a key cooperative) and summarized the experience of contracting work, and then specifically taught the district cadres what contracting work was, what the benefits of contracting work were, and how to contract work, etc. The cadres all said, "There is a way now." They promoted the contracting work system in 26 cooperatives. By this year, the contracting work system has been expanded to more than 280 cooperatives. Second, the leading cadres took the general cadres to the countryside, specifically teaching methods in the process of work. For example, District Committee Deputy Secretary Dong Yuming led the Women's Federation cadre Xu Yuguo to work in Gao Minghuan's cooperative in Gengshangkou Village and found that the cooperative had few people and could not weed the wheat fields, but the women did not go to the fields to work. Dong Yuming helped Xu Yuguo mobilize the women to participate in weeding the wheat and taught her methods, first experimenting in one team, and then promoting it comprehensively after the experiment was successful. Xu Yuguo and the cooperative's management committee studied it, stipulated the labor standard for women weeding wheat, and solved the difficulties of women with children, and as a result, the first team of women was mobilized. Then Xu Yuguo promoted this experience to all teams and mobilized all the women in the cooperative to participate in labor. Dong Yuming also tried to encourage Xu Yuguo to solve other problems in the cooperative, and if it was not right, he would suggest ways to solve it. Now she can work independently.

In the townships and cooperatives, the District Committee put forward the slogan of "old cooperative cadres lead new cooperatives, new cooperative cadres learn from old cooperatives." At first, some old cooperative cadres felt it was troublesome and did not want to help new cooperatives. The District Committee commended the model deeds of Geng Changsuo and others helping new cooperative cadres run cooperatives, and organized new cooperative cadres to go to old cooperatives to ask for "masters," so that the old cooperative cadres felt honored and dispelled the old cooperative cadres' fear of trouble. Ma Zhihe, the old cooperative director of Nanhancun Village, went to help them solve problems in Xiaofengloushe Cooperative in Beihancun Village automatically once he had just recovered from his illness. More new cooperative cadres visited old cooperatives to learn. The cadres of Chengezhuang Village had no experience in running cooperatives for the first time, so they sent Wu Renyi to study at Fan Renhe's cooperative in Fanyuancun Village. Cooperative director Fan Renhe introduced his experience in leading the cooperative to him in detail. After Wu Renyi went back, he used Fan Renhe's experience as a reference to run the cooperative well.

Exchange Cooperative Running Experience

With the vigorous development of the cooperative movement, it was still not enough to rely solely on the method of skilled people leading novices to improve the leadership ability of cadres, and old cooperative cadres often went to new cooperatives to help solve problems, which also wasted a lot of work and affected the work of their own cooperatives. Therefore, the District Committee also adopted various methods to centrally exchange cooperative running experience, which played a significant role in bringing out everyone's wisdom and rapidly improving the district, township, and cooperative cadres.

The exchange of cooperative running experience mainly adopted the following two methods. One was through the mutual aid and cooperation network and the mutual aid and cooperation committee. The whole district organized five mutual aid and cooperation networks according to regions, and also established mutual aid and cooperation committees or joint cooperative committees in villages with multiple cooperatives. The members of the committee are generally cooperative directors and mutual aid team leaders. The mutual aid and cooperation network holds a meeting once a month, and the village mutual aid and cooperation committee holds a meeting every ten days or half a month. Last year, when the pre-distribution was implemented before the autumn harvest, many cooperative cadres did not know how to proceed, but Jin Wenhuan's cooperative in Xiliman Village had already studied the method of pre-distribution: they calculated the annual labor usage, and then calculated the harvest of grain according to the growth of various crops, divided it equally according to the number of workdays, and left the cash crops to make up for the difference at the end. The pre-distribution of Jin Wenhuan's cooperative had a very good effect. After the mutual aid and cooperation network meeting introduced this experience, it was then promoted in various cooperatives. In April this year, the management committees of some large and medium-sized cooperatives still did not know how to lead the production teams. Therefore, at the mutual aid and cooperation network meeting, after everyone exchanged experience, learned from each other's strengths and made up for their weaknesses, they solved the difficulty of leading the production teams, and at the same time, it also played a great role in improving the leadership style of various cooperatives. The management committee of Sun Shousong's cooperative in Yizhihe Village changed the bureaucratic style of just sitting in the house for meetings and not going deep into the production teams in the past; Gao Minghuan's cooperative in Gengshangkou Village also improved its leadership method based on the experience exchanged by the mutual aid and cooperation network and the committee; the eleven members of the management committee implemented a system of dividing work and contracting teams. In order to prevent the occurrence of cadres separating from the masses and separating from labor, they also stipulated such a working system: cooperative cadres handle cooperative affairs every morning, go to the teams to produce in the afternoon, and go deep into the production teams to solve problems in the evening.

Another way to exchange experience is to organize visits. Last year, Jin Wenhuan's cooperative achieved a yield of more than 400 jin per mu of densely planted wheat, which was more than double the yield of general wheat, due to the use of new technology. In order to promote this experience, the District Committee organized cadres of nearby agricultural cooperatives to visit Jin Wenhuan's cooperative for on-site visits. After the visits, many cooperative cadres said that they would definitely implement dense planting when planting wheat in the fall. In the summer, they also visited Jin Wenhuan's cooperative to learn the experience of controlling cotton aphids and carrying millet seedlings by hand, which played a great role in ensuring increased production in various cooperatives.

Carry out Criticism and Self-Criticism

In order to ensure that the leadership level of cadres is constantly improved, the District Committee also paid attention to establishing and adhering to the system of criticism and self-criticism in the cooperatives and teams, so that cooperative and team cadres are often under the supervision of the masses. This year, many cooperatives have established a patriotism and love for the cooperative inspection day system. On the inspection day, a general meeting of all cooperative members is convened, and the cooperative cadres take the lead in making inspections first, and then the cooperative members give opinions to the cadres. Once in Sun Shousong's cooperative, the cooperative members criticized cooperative director Sun Shousong for not grasping the solution to the problems in the cooperative tightly enough and for being lax in his work. Sun Shousong quickly overcame his shortcomings. The undemocratic style of Sun Genhui, the deputy director of the cooperative, was also corrected in this way. Some cadres in Li Shuxin's cooperative in Dasonggezhuang and Gao Minghuan's cooperative in Gengshangkou Village had serious selfish ideas, which were also corrected through criticism and self-criticism. This shows that establishing and adhering to the system of criticism and self-criticism in the cooperatives is an effective way to overcome and correct the shortcomings and mistakes of cadres in a timely manner, and is an important guarantee for continuously improving cadres so that they reach the standard of being fair and capable.

Summarize Experience and Welcome the High Tide of the Cooperative Movement

At present, the main situation of the cooperative movement in the district is that there are fewer large and medium-sized cooperatives and more small cooperatives. Many villages have multiple cooperatives, such as Xiaodi Village, which has more than 30 cooperatives. Therefore, cadres are dispersed, there are more contradictions, and there are many difficulties in leading. The District Committee plans to expand large and medium-sized cooperatives in a planned way on the basis of existing cooperatives after the autumn of this year, in addition to developing more new cooperatives. This requires the existing district and township cadres to learn the methods of leading large and medium-sized cooperatives. To this end, the District Committee has begun to summarize the experience of running large and medium-sized cooperatives, and after the summary, it will organize district and township cadres to study it universally, and plans to select a group of fair and capable rural cadres and cooperative and team cadres for training after the hoeing season and before the autumn harvest, to prepare leading backbones for further developing the cooperative movement after the autumn.

### 互助合作运动中我们是怎样培养干部的

    在互助合作运动中我们是怎样培养干部的
    中共河北饶阳四区委员会书记　张玉刚
    我区农业生产合作社已发展到三百五十五个。参加社的农户共有六千一百多户，占全区总农户的百分之四十二，其中百分之八十的社都办的很好。各种类型的互助组也发展到一千多个，参加组的农户共有三千多户，占全区总户数的百分之二十以上。所以能够获得这些成绩，是和区委注意培养互助合作干部的工作分不开的。现在我区共有一千多个做互助合作工作的干部，在区委有计划地培养下，他们的领导水平都有很大的提高。在二十二名区干部中，有八名已成为办社的熟手，其余的也已能处理社里发生的一般问题。在乡和社的干部中，他们一般地都懂得了互助合作政策，初步熟悉了农业生产合作社的经营管理业务，其中有许多人已能够独立办社。这些干部不仅是巩固现有农业生产合作社和互助组的保证，而且也是进一步开展合作化运动的一支领导力量。
    区委注意培养做互助合作工作的干部是从一九五二年开始的。当时随着全区农业生产合作社的迅速发展（由四个发展到八十个），就提出了一个值得注意的问题，就是领导干部应该跟上农业生产合作社的发展。许多区干部没有办社的知识，社里提出的许多问题解决不了。因此有些干部就不敢到有社的村子去工作。基层组织的干部也还没有重视对合作化运动的领导，有事就推到区委会里来，使区委会疲于应付。这种领导跟不上运动发展的情况，就使全区合作化运动呈现了涣散状态。后来就有三个社散了伙，八个社几乎垮台。当这种严重情况摆在区委会面前的时候，区委会决定各委员要及时到各社去，帮助解决问题。但是，仅仅靠几个区委委员是解决不了多少问题的。这时，才使区委会深深感到，要改变这种状况，必须积极地提高现有区乡干部领导合作化运动的能力；同时注意培养基层干部。
    到实际工作中去
    两年来的经验证明：培养做互助合作工作的干部的最根本最有效的方法是把干部放到实际工作中去锻炼。区委曾大力号召区乡干部和党的基层组织一齐动手来办农业生产合作社。在区干部中实行分片包干，在乡和社的干部中，实行分工包社、包队、包组。当时，并对区干部提出了明确的要求：第一，要帮助农业生产合作社制订一个切实可行的生产计划，第二，要帮助农业生产合作社解决生产过程中所发生的各种问题，第三，要带回办社的经验来。开始工作时，干部中还有不少抵触的思想：有的说：“农业社的问题不如其他工作中的问题好解决。”有的说：“社长不如乡长好当。”也有的说：“当了社干部，就得早死三年。”区委研究了这些思想情况，一方面向广大区乡干部指出只要大家努力学习，很快就会从“外行”变成“内行”。学习的办法，就是向一切“内行”的人（有办社经验的区干部、乡干部和农业生产合作社的社长）学习；一方面对能够克服困难，积极学习办社经验的干部进行表扬，树立旗帜。区委会曾以区助理员张铁锤学会办社的实例教育区干部；又以原来一字不识的耿长锁、宋全道，和拉着三个孩子的妇女王贵烟等当好社长的实例，教育了所有乡和社的干部。干部中害怕困难的思想开始消除，动起手来了。区干部刘长山分工包干郭村乡的社以后，不会推行包工制，他就一连三次跑到三里以外的靳文焕社去学习包工经验。副区长韩金科去年还不敢到社里去，今年便积极地深入到社里去学习了。他说：“外行变内行，只有亲自动手才行”。乡村干部也积极主动起来，邹村村干部实行分工包社以后，加强了集体领导，工作中发生了问题，便共同研究解决。由于女社长王贵烟的影响，今年全区出现了十八个女社长，她们都和男子一样地领导着农业生产合作社，而且领导的很好。
    熟手带生手
    在区乡干部中，实行大家动手、分工负责以后，干部的责任心加强了，工作热情很高。这时，一方面要靠干部自己在实际工作中努力学习，另一方面，也需要领导上采取有效的措施，帮助干部学会办社。区委会在这方面采取的方法是：熟手带生手。
    在区干部中首先是领导干部带动一般干部，带动的方法有二：一是领导干部深入重点，创造经验，再向一般干部传授。比如去年有许多社因劳力支配不好，窝工现象严重，区乡干部没法解决，区委书记便深入到宋全道社（重点社），总结了包工经验，然后向区干部具体传授什么叫包工，包工有什么好处，怎样包工等等。干部们都说：“可有门道了。”他们分头在二十六个社里推广了包工制。到今年，包工制已扩大到了二百八十多个社。二是领导干部带一般干部下乡，从工作的过程中具体教办法。比如区委副书记董玉明带领妇联会干部许玉国到耿尚口村高明焕社工作，发现该社人手少，麦地锄不出来，但是妇女都没有下地劳动。董玉明就帮助许玉国把妇女发动起来参加锄麦，并教给她办法，先在一个队里试验，等试验成功后再全面推广。许玉国便和社的管理委员会作了研究，规定了妇女锄麦记工标准，又解决了有小孩的妇女的困难，结果把一队妇女发动起来了。接着许玉国把这一经验向各队推广，发动全社妇女参加了劳动。对社里的其他问题，董玉明也是尽量鼓励许玉国去解决，不对的时候，便给她提出办法。现在她已能独立地工作了。
    在乡和社里，区委提出“老社干部带新社，新社干部向老社学习”的口号。起初，有的老社干部嫌麻烦，不愿帮助新社，区委就表扬了耿长锁等帮助新社干部办社的模范事迹，并组织新社干部到老社请“师傅”，使老社干部感到光荣，打消了老社干部怕麻烦的思想。南韩村老社长马致合，有一次病刚好，听说北韩村肖凤楼社发生了问题，便自动地去帮助他们解决。新社干部到老社访问学习的更多。程各庄干部初次办社没经验，便派武仁义到范苑村范仁和社学习，社长范仁和便把自己领导社的经验详细地介绍给他。武仁义回去后，参照范仁和的经验把社办好了。
    交流办社经验
    随着合作化运动的蓬勃发展，仅仅依靠熟手带新手的办法去提高干部的领导能力，还是很不够的，而且老社干部经常到新社去帮助解决问题也误工很多，影响自己社的工作。因此，区委又采取各种方式集中地交流办社经验，这对发挥大家的智慧，迅速提高区、乡社干部起了重大作用。
    交流办社经验，主要采取了以下两种方式，一种是通过互助合作网、互助合作委员会去进行。全区按片组织了五个互助合作网，还在多社的村建立了互助合作委员会或联社委员会。委员会的成员一般都是社长和互助组长。互助合作网每月召开一次会议，村互助合作委员会每十天或半月召开一次会议。去年秋收前实行预分时，许多社的干部都不知道怎么进行，但西里满村靳文焕社已研究出了预分的办法：他们计算出全年用工数，再根据各种作物生长情况，计算出粮食的收获量，按工数均分，留下经济作物最后找补。靳文焕社预分的效果很好。互助合作网会议介绍了这一经验后，接着便在各社推行开了。今年四月间有些大型社和中型社的管理委员会还不知道怎样领导生产队，于是在互助合作网会上，经过大家交流经验，取长补短，解决了领导生产队的困难，同时对改进各社领导作风也起了很大作用。一致合村孙寿松社的管理委员会便改变了过去光坐在屋子里开会，不深入生产队的官僚主义作风；耿尚口村高明焕社根据互助合作网和委员会交流的经验，也改进了领导方法；管委会十一个委员，实行了分工包队。为了防止干部脱离群众、脱离劳动现象的发生，他们还规定了这样的工作制度：社干部每天上午处理社务，下午一律下队生产，晚上深入生产队解决问题。
    交流经验的另一种方式是组织参观。去年靳文焕社，由于采用了新技术。每亩密植小麦的产量达到四百斤以上，超过一般小麦产量的一倍。区委为了推广这一经验，便组织附近农业社的干部到靳文焕社进行实地参观，参观后许多社的干部都表示秋后种麦时一定实行密植。夏季他们又参观了靳文焕社治棉蚜和谷子手提苗的经验，对保证各社增产起了很大作用。
    开展批评和自我批评
    为了保证干部的领导水平不断提高，区委还注意在社内组内建立和坚持了批评和自我批评制度。使社组干部经常处于群众的监督之中。今年已有许多社建立了爱国爱社检查日制度，每到检查日这一天，即召集全体社员大会，由社干部带头先作检查，然后由社员给干部提意见。有一次在孙寿松社里，社员们批评社长孙寿松，对解决社里的问题抓的不紧，工作松懈。孙寿松很快地克服了自己的缺点。该社副社长孙根会的不民主作风也是这样纠正过来的。大宋各庄李树欣社，耿尚口村高明焕社有些干部存在着严重的自私自利思想，也都是经过开展批评和自我批评纠正过来的。由此证明，建立和坚持社里的批评和自我批评制度，是及时克服和纠正干部缺点与错误的有效办法，是不断提高干部使其达到公道能干这一标准的重要保证。
    总结经验迎接合作化运动的高潮
    目前全区合作化运动的主要情况是，大型社和中型社较少，小型社多，有许多村都是一村多社，如小堤村就有三十多个社。因而干部分散，矛盾较多，领导起来有很多困难。区委准备在今年秋后，除了发展更多的新社以外，并在现有社的基础上有计划地扩建大型社和中型社。这就要求现有的区乡干部必须学会领导大型社和中型社的办法。为此，区委已着手总结办大型社和中型社的经验，总结后将组织区乡干部普遍学习，并计划在挂锄后秋收前挑选一批公道能干的乡村干部及社组干部进行训练，为秋后进一步开展合作化运动准备好领导骨干。
