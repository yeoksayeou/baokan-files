    Congratulations on the 10th Anniversary of the Founding of the People's Republic of Poland
    Chairman Mao Zedong's Telegram to Chairman Zawadzki

To Comrade Aleksander Zawadzki, Chairman of the Council of State of the People's Republic of Poland:

    On the occasion of the 10th anniversary of the National Day of the People's Republic of Poland, on behalf of the Chinese people, the Government of the People's Republic of China, and in my own name, I extend my heartfelt congratulations to the Polish people, the Government of the People's Republic of Poland, and to you.

    Over the past ten years, under the leadership of the Polish United Workers' Party, the Polish people have achieved brilliant successes in consolidating the people's democratic system and the country's socialist industrialization. People's Poland has become an important force in the world's peace, democracy, and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.

    The Chinese people sincerely wish the Polish people even greater achievements in their continued efforts to build socialism and safeguard world peace.

                          Mao Zedong, July 20, 1954, Beijing
