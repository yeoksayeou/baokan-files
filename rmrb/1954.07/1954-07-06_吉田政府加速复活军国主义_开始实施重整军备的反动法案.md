Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo: News: The rearmament laws began to be implemented on the 1st. The American and Japanese reactionaries are pushing Japan back to the old road that once brought suffering and humiliation to the Japanese people.

　　On July 1st, the "Self-Defense Forces Law" and the "Defense Agency Organization Law" drafted by the Yoshida government in accordance with the so-called "US-Japan Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement" officially came into effect, and the "Security Forces" and "Security Agency" were also reorganized into "Self-Defense Forces" and "Defense Agency." These measures are part of the American plan to revive Japanese militarism. The new Police Law and the "National Defense Secrets Protection Law" (a reprint of the wartime "Military Secrets Protection Law"), which are inseparable from rearmament and strengthen the fascist police rule, also came into effect at the same time.

　　With the implementation of these laws, Japan's economy will be further militarized. According to Kyodo News, "Recently, the Economic Deliberation Agency and the Ministry of International Trade and Industry are studying ways to transform into a defense economy, and are seriously considering plans to support the defense industry."

　　Kyodo News pointed out that the United States is attempting to make Japan an "anti-communist fortress" for aggression in the Far East more quickly. However, as Reuters said: "The Japanese still remember the government controlled by military leaders, and also remember the painful defeat in the war. They are generally opposed to rearmament." Obviously, the will of the Japanese people to demand peace, democracy, and freedom is irresistible. The Yoshida government's measures to accelerate rearmament and revive militarism will only be met with stronger opposition from the people.

    吉田政府加速复活军国主义
    开始实施重整军备的反动法案
    【新华社讯】东京消息：许多重整军备的法案一日起开始实施。美日反动派正在把日本推回到曾经给日本人民带来苦难和屈辱的老路上去。
    七月一日，吉田政府按照美日所谓“共同防御援助协定”的规定而拟订的“自卫队法”和“防卫厅组织法”正式生效，“保安队”和“保安厅”也随着改建为“自卫队”和“防卫厅”。这些措施是美国复活日本军国主义的计划的一部分。和重整军备密不可分的加强法西斯警察统治的新警察法和“国防机密保护法”（战时“军机保护法”的再版）也在同时开始生效。
    随着这些法案的实施，日本的经济将进一步军事化。据共同社说，“最近经济审议厅和通商产业省正在研究转变为国防经济的办法，并正在认真考虑扶植防御产业的计划。”
    共同社指出，美国正企图更快地使日本成为侵略远东的“反共堡垒”。然而，如路透社所说：“日本人还记得为军事领袖们所控制的政府，也记得战争中苦难深重的失败，他们是普遍地反对重整军备的。”显然，日本人民要求和平、民主、自由的意志是不可扼杀的，吉田政府的加速重整军备和复活军国主义的措施只会遭到人民更加强烈的反对。
