    Good Rice Growth in Huaihai Farm's Saline-Alkali Wasteland
    Early Maize Bumper Harvest in Baise Prefecture, Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region, Guangxi Province
    The Huaihai Farm Experimental Station in Jiangsu Province has trial-planted 380 mu of rice on reclaimed wasteland, and the emergence of seedlings is good. Since the establishment of Huaihai Farm, the wheat and cotton sown by machine on saline-alkali wasteland have yielded bumper harvests. The surrounding farmers are deeply convinced of the benefits of agricultural collectivization and mechanization. Last autumn, the farm used tractors to reclaim 380 mu of wasteland in preparation for trial planting of rice. This wasteland was originally a salt field twenty years ago, with a saline-alkali content of more than 3/1000. During the winter, three large drainage ditches were dug to divide the large area of land into three fields, and small embankments were built around the fields. After winter plowing, the land was irrigated to wash away the alkali. After the Beginning of Spring this year, it was plowed again and irrigated twice, and after the Qingming Festival, it was plowed and harrowed once each. By late April, all the rice had been sown. At present, except for a few low-lying areas where the alkali water has not been drained and no seedlings have emerged, more than 80 percent have emerged. The seedlings are 8 to 10 centimeters high, the stalks are thick and strong, and the color is oily green. The second weeding has now begun.

    The harvest of early maize in Baise Prefecture, Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region, Guangxi Province, was completed by mid-June. Baise, Tiandong, Pingguo, Donglan, Fengshan, Lingle, Mubian, Debao and other counties reported bumper harvests.
    Within the areas of bumper harvest, agricultural producers' cooperatives have seen the greatest increases in production. For example, the Nasha Cooperative in Fengshan averaged 304 jin per mu, an increase of 189.5 percent over last year, 47.5 percent more than the Li Baoling permanent mutual aid team in Nasha Township, and much higher than the yields of individual farmers. Mutual aid teams in various places also generally had bumper harvests of early maize. For example, the Luo Bingxin mutual aid team in Xiangzhou Township, Tiandong, planted 12 mu of early maize this year, harvesting 1,300 jin more than when they farmed individually in the past. Early maize in seven townships including Jiazuan and Poyue in Fengshan also generally increased by about 20 percent compared to last year.
    In order to strive for even greater harvests, agricultural producers' cooperatives and mutual aid teams in various places, after harvesting the maize, are immediately leading individual farmers to turn over the soil, plant second-crop maize, and launch a crash effort to accumulate fertilizer, striving for another bumper harvest.

    淮海农场在盐碱荒地上种的水稻生长良好
    广西省桂西僮族自治区百色专区早玉米丰收
    江苏省国营淮海农场试验场在开垦的荒地上试种水稻三百八十亩，出苗情况良好。淮海农场建立以来，在盐垦荒地上用机器播种的小麦、棉花都得到丰收，周围农民看了都深信农业集体化机械化的好处。去年秋天，该场用拖拉机开垦了荒地三百八十亩，准备试验种水稻，这块荒地原是二十年前晒盐场子，含盐碱分在千分之三以上。在交冬时开了三道大排水沟，把这块大面积土地分成三条田，并在田的周围筑起小圩子，冬耕一次后灌水洗碱，今年立春后又耕一次，灌水两次，清明后又再耕耙各一次。四月下旬，水稻全部播种完毕。目前除少数低洼地方碱水未排清而没有出苗外，百分之八十以上都已出苗，苗高八公分到十公分，苗杆粗壮，颜色油绿，现在已开始锄第二次草了。

    广西省桂西僮族自治区百色专区早玉米至六月中旬已收摘完毕。百色、田东、平果、东兰、凤山、凌乐、睦边、德保等县喜报丰收。
    在丰收地区内，尤以农业生产合作社增产最多。如凤山那沙社平均每亩收三百零四斤，比去年增产百分之一百八十九点五，比那沙乡李保令常年互助组增产百分之四十七点五，比单干农民的产量高出很多。各地互助组早玉米也普遍丰收。如田东祥周乡罗炳新互助组今年种十二亩早玉米，比过去单干时多收一千三百斤。凤山甲篆、坡月等七个乡早玉米也一般比去年增产百分之二十左右。
    为了争取更大的丰收，目前各地农业生产合作社互助组收完玉米又带动单干农民马上翻土，种上二糙玉米，突击积肥，争取再一次丰收。
