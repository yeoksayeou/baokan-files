The famous Huangyan mandarin oranges in our country will have a bumper harvest this year. The orange trees on both banks of the Chengjiang River in Zhejiang Province are now covered with green fruit. Farmers are currently working hard to spray "666" and pine-alkali mixture to prevent and control diseases and pests. In the orange groves of the Huangyan Citrus Farm and advanced agricultural production cooperatives, Bordeaux mixture is also widely sprayed. It is estimated that this year's Huangyan mandarin orange production can increase by about 40%. In order to further develop Huangyan mandarin orange production, the Chinese Academy of Sciences working group is now studying the existing cold-resistant varieties, so that citrus can be transplanted to cold areas north of the Yangtze River in the future, so that the people of the north can also eat more fresh and sweet citrus; Professor Yu Dafu, a famous expert in plant diseases and insect pests, is leading a group of students from Beijing Agricultural University to Huangyan to study the prevention and control of citrus tree diseases and insect pests, and to prepare for citrus canker testing; the East China Agricultural Science Institute is also working with the local state-owned Huangyan Citrus Farm to jointly study and solve the problems of alternate bearing in citrus production, and has conducted various experiments such as reasonable fertilization and reasonable pruning of citrus trees.

    中国科学院等部门派出工作人员
    研究发展黄岩蜜橘的生产
    我国著名的黄岩蜜橘，今年将获得丰收。浙江省澄江两岸的橘树现已结满了青绿色的果实。目前农民正在紧张地喷射“六六六”和松碱合剂，以防治病害。黄岩柑橘场和先进农业生产合作社的橘园里，也普遍喷射了波尔多液药剂。据估计今年黄岩蜜橘可增产四成左右。为了进一步发展黄岩蜜橘生产，现在，中国科学院工作组正在研究现有的耐寒品种，以便将来把柑橘移植到长江以北的寒冷地带去，使北方人民也能吃到更多的鲜甜的柑橘；著名的植物病虫害专家俞大绂教授率领一批北京农业大学学生，也到黄岩研究防治橘树病虫害，和进行柑橘疫病检验的准备工作；华东农业科研究所也正在和地方国营黄岩柑橘场共同研究解决柑橘生产上的大、小年等问题，并进行了橘树的合理施肥，合理修剪等各种试验。
