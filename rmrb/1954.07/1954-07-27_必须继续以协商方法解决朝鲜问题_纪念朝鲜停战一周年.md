    The Korean Issue Must Continue to Be Resolved Through Negotiation
    -- Commemorating the Anniversary of the Korean Armistice
    Today is the first anniversary of the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement. On this day, people are satisfied to see that: after achieving the great victory of the Korean armistice, the forces striving for peace have now achieved a major victory at the Geneva Conference in the agreement on the Indochina armistice and the restoration of peace; the U.S. imperialist policy of attempting to enslave the people of Asian countries, expand the war in Asia, and provoke the Chinese people has once again been defeated. This undoubtedly greatly encourages the determination and confidence of peace-loving people in Asia and around the world to strive for further consolidation of peace in Asia and around the world.
    The Korean armistice, achieved through the efforts of Korea and China, the Soviet Union, and all peace-loving forces, has opened the way for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and other international disputes. The failure of U.S. imperialism in the Korean War clearly showed that the Korean people, determined to safeguard their national independence and sovereignty and strive for the peaceful reunification of their motherland, are invincible; any aggression threatening the People's Republic of China can and must be defeated. The Korean issue must be resolved through negotiation based on the realization of the national rights and peaceful aspirations of the Korean people. Asian peace must be consolidated.
    In the year since the Korean armistice, the Korean and Chinese people have made tremendous efforts to consolidate peace in Korea and strive for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and have achieved positive results. The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers have faithfully fulfilled and maintained the implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement, and have striven to maintain the stability of the Korean armistice. The Korean and Chinese side resolutely fought against the U.S. side's crimes of forcibly detaining prisoners of war, obstructing the convening of the Korean political conference, and other violations of the Korean Armistice Agreement. Although the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission failed to complete the tasks stipulated in the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission," with the U.S. side flagrantly violating the "Terms of Reference" and forcibly detaining more than 48,000 of our prisoners of war; the Indian, Polish, and Czechoslovak members of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission still did a great deal of work, made a final report, and told the people of the world the truth about the U.S. side's forcible detention of prisoners of war. At the same time, the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission also made contributions in supervising the implementation of the armistice agreement. The U.S. side tried its best to attack and slander it, and attempted to abolish this supervisory body, but failed.
    On the other hand, the United States has used various methods in the past year to maintain the unstable state of the Korean armistice, and has tried its best to prevent the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and has tried its best to use the Korean issue to create tension. On the issue of prisoners of war, the U.S. side broke its promises, wantonly sabotaged the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission," and used all kinds of barbaric and brutal methods to massacre and abuse prisoners of war who demanded repatriation, insulted the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, weakened its power and paralyzed it. The United States openly abducted more than 48,000 non-directly repatriated prisoners of war and handed them over to the Li-Chiang bandit gangs to serve as cannon fodder. The United States frequently violated the armistice agreement, transporting a large amount of reinforcement military supplies into South Korea to strengthen the Syngman Rhee army. The United States also concluded a so-called "common defense treaty" with Syngman Rhee, allowing U.S. troops to occupy South Korea for a long time, turning the entire South Korea into a U.S. military base. In order to obstruct the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, the United States wantonly sabotaged the bilateral talks on the issue of the political conference, attempting to keep Korea permanently divided. Thanks to the Soviet Union's efforts at the Berlin Conference, the Geneva Conference was able to convene to discuss the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and the restoration of peace in Indochina. But the United States again sabotaged the discussion of the Korean issue at the Geneva Conference. People all over the world have seen that the Korean and Chinese side have worked hard to maintain the Korean armistice in the past year, while the United States has tried its best to harm the Korean armistice; the Korean and Chinese side have consistently sought a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, while the United States has tried its best to obstruct it. These facts undoubtedly prove that the United States is a fierce enemy of the Korean people and all peace-loving people in the world.
    During the process of discussing the Korean issue at the Geneva Conference, the delegations of Korea, China, and the Soviet Union always adhered to justice, patiently negotiated, and put forward a series of reasonable proposals. These proposals provided a practical basis for realizing the peaceful reunification of Korea and consolidating peace in Korea, and won the full support of the world's peace and democratic forces and the widespread sympathy of fair-minded public opinion in various countries. Although all these efforts of the delegations of Korea, China, and the Soviet Union failed to yield results due to the wanton obstruction and sabotage of the U.S. delegation; however, the reasonable proposals of Korea, China, and the Soviet Union pointed the way for continuing to strive for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and the more powerful support of the people of the world will be an important guarantee for finally defeating U.S. policy and seeking peace, democracy, independence and reunification in Korea.
    The discussion of the Korean issue at the Geneva Conference concentratedly exposed the ambitions of the U.S. ruling clique on the Korean issue. The United States' participation in the discussion of the Korean issue at the Geneva Conference was not at all for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, but to try to prove the impossibility of negotiation, so as to continue to use the Korean issue to aggravate international tension. The U.S. delegation unreasonably rejected all the reasonable proposals put forward by Korea, China, and the Soviet Union, and stubbornly insisted that the elections in Korea be supervised by the United Nations, which is one of the belligerent parties, so as to enable Syngman Rhee to unify the entire Korea under the support of the American bayonets, turn the entire Korea into a U.S. colony, and a springboard for attacking China. The U.S. ruling clique is even so arrogant that the U.S. delegation at the Geneva Conference dared to refuse the possibility of continuing to seek a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue in the future, and refused to undertake the obligation to guarantee that Korean peace would not be threatened. Obviously, the U.S. ruling clique is attempting to fundamentally block the road to a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, in order to pursue the resurgence of the Korean War.
    The facts show that the U.S. ruling clique is moving towards the road of preparing for a new war. After the U.S. war-monger Van Fleet went to South Korea to carry out military deployments and plan a large-scale expansion of the Syngman Rhee army, U.S. President Eisenhower is about to hold a meeting with Syngman Rhee in Washington. According to people in the Syngman Rhee group, Syngman Rhee will request the United States to issue a joint statement with him during the talks, stating that "no more negotiations will be held with the Communists on the issue of Korean reunification," and requesting the United States to "abolish" the Korean Armistice Agreement and support the Syngman Rhee group's "northward march" to "unify" Korea by force. It is worth noting that while attempting to create new tensions in Korea, the United States is also working hard to piece together a Pacific military group, so as to bring the Syngman Rhee group and the Chiang Kai-shek remnant bandits in Taiwan together as a tool for launching new military adventures against China. To this end, the United States is also strengthening military assistance to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and clamoring to conclude a "common security bilateral treaty" with the Chiang bandit. All these crazy activities of the U.S. ruling clique not only run counter to the road of peacefully resolving the Korean issue, but also seriously threaten peace and security in the Far East and Asia.
    The policy of the U.S. ruling clique to close the door to a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue is unworkable. The development of the Asian and world situation in the year since the Korean armistice has fully proved that the U.S. aggression forces cannot stop the progress of the peace forces. In the past year, the unity and friendship between the Korean and Chinese people have become more consolidated; the peace policies of Korea and China have been recognized by the world; and the international status and prestige of the People's Republic of China have been greatly enhanced. Moreover, the agreements on the Indochina issue at the Geneva Conference and the joint statements issued by the Prime Ministers of China and India and China and Myanmar not long ago have greatly strengthened peace in Asia and created conditions for the establishment of collective security in Asia. The people of Asian countries and all peace-loving people in the world believe that continuing to seek a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue is a very urgent matter. This will of peace-loving people cannot be ignored.
    The position of Korea, China, the Soviet Union and all peace-loving forces in seeking a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue is firm and unwavering. In a statement issued on July 6, Korean Democratic People's Republic Foreign Minister Nam Il pointed out: "The issue of Korean reunification still requires continued efforts in the future, and negotiations should be conducted to seek a resolution through consultation." In his speech at the Geneva Conference on July 21, our Premier Zhou Enlai also emphasized: "Two major issues were discussed at this Geneva Conference, namely the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and the restoration of peace in Indochina. Although no agreement has been reached on the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, it has not been removed from the agenda. Now, this conference has not only reached an agreement on the cessation of hostilities on the issue of restoring peace in Indochina, but also reached a principled agreement on resolving political issues. This brings new hope for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue." In a statement on the Geneva Conference issued on July 23, the Soviet government also solemnly stated: "The Soviet government believes that it is very necessary to ensure the speedy resolution of the Korean issue under conditions that are conducive to Korean national reunification and conducive to safeguarding peace in Asia and the world." This clear policy of the governments of Korea, China, and the Soviet Union is undoubtedly a decisive force for continuing to seek a resolution of the Korean issue along the path of peaceful consultation. Negotiations on the Korean issue must be resumed, and the governments of the countries concerned should work towards this end.
    The Korean and Chinese people and all peace-loving people in the world must not relax their vigilance against the U.S. imperialist plot to sabotage the Korean armistice in order to pursue the resurgence of the Korean War. The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers have assumed the most important responsibility for maintaining the implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement after the Korean armistice, and the efforts they have made for this are greatly admired by the Korean and Chinese people and all peace-loving people in the world. The Chinese people will continue to fully support their just cause. The Chinese people will continue to strengthen the just struggle to resist the United States and aid Korea, and work together with the Korean people and all peace-loving people in the world to continue to strive for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

    必须继续以协商方法解决朝鲜问题
    ——纪念朝鲜停战一周年
    今天是朝鲜停战协定签订的一周年。在这个日子里，人们满意地看到：争取和平的力量在取得朝鲜停战的伟大胜利之后，现在又在日内瓦会议上取得了印度支那停战和恢复和平问题的协议的重大胜利；美帝国主义妄图奴役亚洲各国人民、扩大亚洲的战争和向中国人民挑衅的政策，又一次遭到了失败。这无疑大大地鼓舞了亚洲和全世界爱好和平人民争取进一步巩固亚洲和全世界的和平的决心和信心。
    由朝中两国和苏联以及一切爱好和平力量的努力所取得的朝鲜停战，为和平解决朝鲜问题和其他的国际争端开辟了道路。美帝国主义在朝鲜战争中的失败，清楚地表明了，决心维护自己的民族独立和主权、争取祖国和平统一的朝鲜人民是不可被战胜的；任何对中华人民共和国的侵略威胁都是可以而且必须加以击破的。朝鲜问题必须在实现朝鲜人民的民族权利及和平愿望的基础上以协商的方法求得解决。亚洲和平必须得到巩固。
    朝鲜停战一年来，朝中人民为巩固朝鲜的和平和争取和平解决朝鲜问题作了巨大的努力，并取得了肯定的成效。朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军忠实地履行并维护着朝鲜停战协定的实施，努力维持朝鲜停战状态的稳定。朝中方面对美方强迫扣留战俘、阻挠朝鲜政治会议的召开及其他违反朝鲜停战协定的罪行，进行了坚决的斗争。中立国遣返委员会虽然未能完成“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”所规定的任务，美方悍然违反“职权范围”强迫扣留了我方四万八千余名战俘；但中立国遣返委员会的印度、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克委员，还是做了许多工作，作出了最后报告，把美方强迫扣留战俘的真相告诉全世界人民。同时中立国监察委员会也在监督停战协定实施方面作出了贡献，美方竭力加以攻击和诽谤，并企图取消这个监察机构，但未能得逞。
    另一方面，美国却在过去一年中用种种方法来保持朝鲜停战的不稳定状态，竭力使朝鲜问题不得和平解决，竭力利用朝鲜问题来制造紧张局势。在战俘问题上，美方背信弃义，横蛮破坏“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”，用各种最野蛮最残暴的办法屠杀和虐待要求遣返的战俘，侮辱中立国遣返委员会，削弱它的权力并使之归于瘫痪，美国公然将四万八千余名不直接遣返的战俘劫走，把他们交给李蒋匪帮充当炮灰。美国经常违反停战协定，把大量增援性的军事物资运进南朝鲜来加强李承晚军队。美国又和李承晚订立所谓“共同防御条约”，使美国军队长期占领南朝鲜，变整个南朝鲜为美国军事基地。美国为了阻挠朝鲜问题的和平解决，横蛮地破坏了关于政治会议问题的双方会谈，企图使朝鲜永远陷于分裂。由于苏联在柏林会议上的努力，日内瓦会议才得以召开来讨论和平解决朝鲜问题和恢复印度支那和平问题。但美国又破坏了日内瓦会议上关于朝鲜问题的讨论。全世界人民都看到，在过去一年中朝中方面努力维护朝鲜停战，美国则竭力危害朝鲜停战；朝中方面一贯寻求朝鲜问题的和平解决，美国则竭力加以阻挠。这些事实确切无疑地证明了：美国是朝鲜人民和全世界爱好和平人民的凶恶敌人。
    朝、中、苏三国代表团在日内瓦会议讨论朝鲜问题的过程中，始终坚持正义，耐心协商，提出了一系列的合理建议。这些建议提供了实现朝鲜和平统一和巩固朝鲜和平的切实的基础，获得了世界和平民主力量的全力支持，和各国公正舆论的广泛同情。虽然朝、中、苏三国代表团的这一切努力，由于美国代表团的横蛮阻挠和破坏，而未能获得结果；但是，朝、中、苏三国的合理建议指引了继续争取和平解决朝鲜问题的道路，全世界人民的更加有力的支持，将是最后击败美国政策，求得朝鲜的和平、民主、独立与统一的重要保证。
    日内瓦会议关于朝鲜问题的讨论，集中地暴露了美国统治集团在朝鲜问题上所怀抱的野心。美国参加日内瓦会议关于朝鲜问题的讨论根本不是为了和平解决朝鲜问题，而是企图证明协商的不可能，以便继续利用朝鲜问题来加剧国际紧张局势。美国代表团无理地拒绝了朝、中、苏三国所提出的一切合理建议，而顽固地坚持要由交战一方的联合国监督朝鲜的选举，以便使李承晚在美国刺刀的支持下统一全朝鲜，把全朝鲜变为美国的殖民地，和进攻中国的跳板。美国统治集团甚至狂妄到这种程度，美国代表团在日内瓦会议上竟敢拒绝在今后继续寻求和平解决朝鲜问题的可能性，拒绝承担保证朝鲜和平不受威胁的义务。显然，美国统治集团是企图借此根本堵死和平解决朝鲜问题的道路，以便追求朝鲜战争的再起。
    事实表明，美国统治集团正在向准备新战争的道路上走去。在美国战争贩子范佛里特到南朝鲜进行军事部署和策划大规模地扩充李承晚军队之后，美国总统艾森豪威尔又即将在华盛顿与李承晚举行会议。据李承晚集团的人透露，李承晚在会谈中将要求美国与他一道发表一项联合声明，表示“不再和共方举行关于朝鲜统一问题的谈判”，并且要求美国“废除”朝鲜停战协定，支持李承晚集团“向北进军”，用武力“统一”朝鲜。值得注意的是，美国在企图在朝鲜制造新的紧张形势的同时，还在努力拼凑太平洋军事集团，以便把李承晚集团与台湾的蒋介石残匪拉在一道，作为对中国发动新的军事冒险的工具。为此，美国也正在加强对蒋介石匪帮的军事援助，并叫嚷着要与蒋匪订立一个“共同安全双边条约”。美国统治集团的这一切疯狂的活动，不但与和平解决朝鲜问题的道路背道而驰，而且日益严重地威胁着远东和亚洲地区的和平与安全。
    美国统治集团妄图关死和平解决朝鲜问题的大门的政策是行不通的。朝鲜停战的一年来，亚洲和世界局势的发展已完全证明了美国侵略势力是阻挡不了和平力量的进展的。一年来朝中人民的团结和友谊更加巩固了；朝中两国的和平政策已获得全世界的公认；中华人民共和国的国际地位和威望大大地提高了。并且，日内瓦会议关于印度支那问题的协议和不久前中印和中缅两国总理所发表的联合声明，更大大地加强了亚洲的和平，并为在亚洲建立集体安全创造了条件。亚洲各国人民和全世界爱好和平人民都认为继续谋求朝鲜问题的和平解决是非常迫切的事情。爱好和平人民的这种意志是不容忽视的。
    朝、中、苏三国和一切爱好和平的力量谋求和平解决朝鲜问题的立场是坚定不移的。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相南日在七月六日发表的声明中指出：“朝鲜的统一问题，今后仍需继续努力，以协商的方法进行谈判来求得解决。”我国周恩来总理在七月二十一日的日内瓦会议上发言中，也强调说：“这次在日内瓦会议上曾经讨论了两大问题，即和平解决朝鲜问题和恢复印度支那和平问题。关于和平解决朝鲜问题，虽然没有达成任何协议，但是，它并没有从议程上去掉。现在，本会议对于恢复印度支那和平问题，不仅达成了停止敌对行动的协议，而且达成了关于解决政治问题的原则协议。这就为和平解决朝鲜问题带来了新的希望。”苏联政府在七月二十三日发表的关于日内瓦会议的声明中，也郑重表示：“苏联政府认为，保证在有利于朝鲜民族统一、有利于保障亚洲和全世界和平的条件下从速解决朝鲜问题，是非常必要的。”朝、中、苏三国政府这种明确的政策，无疑是使朝鲜问题继续沿着和平协商道路谋求解决的决定性的力量。朝鲜问题的谈判是必须恢复的，有关国家的政府应该为此而努力。
    朝中人民及全世界爱好和平人民，对于美国帝国主义企图破坏朝鲜停战以追求朝鲜战争再起的阴谋，丝毫也不能放松警惕。朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军在朝鲜停战后为维护朝鲜停战协定的实施，担承了最重要的责任，他们为此所作的努力是朝中人民和全世界爱好和平人民十分钦佩的。中国人民将继续全力支持他们的正义事业。中国人民将继续加强抗美援朝的正义斗争，与朝鲜人民和全世界爱好和平人民在一道，继续为朝鲜问题的和平解决而奋斗。
