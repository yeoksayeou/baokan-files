    When the news of the agreement on restoring peace in Indochina reached Urumqi, representatives of various ethnic groups attending the first session of the First Xinjiang Provincial People's Congress issued statements one after another, congratulating the victory of peace. Bao Erhan, representative of the Provincial People's Congress and Chairman of the Provincial People's Government, stated that the Chinese delegation headed by Premier Zhou Enlai made outstanding contributions to the successful agreement of the conference, and China's international status as a world power has become a universally recognized fact. He said that the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang deeply feel how happy and proud they are to live in the fraternal and harmonious family of all ethnic groups in New China. However, U.S. imperialism is still occupying our country's territory of Taiwan and is still piecing together a Southeast Asian military aggression bloc, attempting to launch a new war. The people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang will, together with the people of the whole country, fight to eliminate the Chiang bandits, drive out U.S. imperialism, and recover Taiwan.
    Saifuddin, representative of the Xinjiang Provincial People's Congress and Chairman of the Xinjiang Provincial Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, said: The agreement on the Indochina peace issue is a great encouragement to peace-loving people all over the world and a major blow to the American ruling clique. While celebrating the realization of peace in Indochina, we must strengthen our vigilance against U.S. imperialism. We must never forget Taiwan, an inseparable part of our motherland. We must resolutely smash the aggression plots of the American ruling clique and fight for the liberation of Taiwan.
    Abudula (Uyghur, farmer), a representative of the Provincial People's Congress, said: The news of the ceasefire in Indochina made me very excited. I know that people all over the world love peace, and we Chinese people are building socialism and need peace even more. However, U.S. imperialism is still occupying our Taiwan. Our farmers of all ethnic groups must work harder to produce more grain and cotton, support national industrial construction, strengthen our country's strength, and we must liberate Taiwan.
    Rashida (Tatar), Deputy Director of the Xinjiang Provincial Democratic Women's Federation and representative of the Provincial People's Congress, said: The eight-year Indochina War has caused many innocent women and children in Indochina to be sacrificed, and many women in France have lost their husbands, brothers, and sons. Now that an agreement has been reached on restoring peace in Indochina, women of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang Province warmly congratulate the women of the three Indochinese countries and France on achieving a peaceful life.

    新疆省人民代表大会代表发表谈话
    当印度支那恢复和平问题达成协议的消息传到乌鲁木齐市时，正在参加新疆省人民代表大会第一届第一次会议的各民族代表纷纷发表谈话，祝贺和平的胜利。省人民代表大会代表、省人民政府主席鲍尔汉在谈话中认为以周恩来总理为首的中国代表团，为大会的胜利达成协议有着卓越的贡献，我国作为世界大国的国际地位已成举世公认的事实。他说，新疆各族人民深切地感到生活在新中国各民族友爱和睦的大家庭里，是如何的幸福和自豪。但是，美帝国主义还在侵占着我们祖国的领土台湾，还在拚凑东南亚军事侵略集团，企图发动新的战争。新疆各族人民将和全国人民一道，为消灭蒋匪，驱逐美帝国主义，收复台湾而奋斗。
    新疆省人民代表大会代表、中国人民保卫世界和平委员会新疆省分会主席赛福鼎说：这次印度支那和平问题达成协议，对全世界爱好和平的人民是一个极大的鼓舞，同时是对美国统治集团一个重大的打击。我们在庆祝印度支那和平实现的时候，更要加强对美帝国主义的警惕。我们绝对不能忘记我们祖国不可分割的领土台湾。我们必须坚决粉碎美国统治集团的侵略阴谋，为解放台湾而斗争。
    省人民代表大会代表阿不都拉（维吾尔族、农民）说：印度支那停战的消息使我非常兴奋。我知道全世界人民都爱好和平，我们中国人民正在建设社会主义，更需要和平。但是美帝国主义还侵占着我国的台湾，我们各族农民要更加努力生产，多打粮食、多收棉花，支援国家工业建设，壮大我国力量，一定要解放台湾。
    省人民代表大会代表、新疆省民主妇女联合会副主任拉西达（塔塔尔族）说：历时八年的印度支那战争，使印度支那许多无辜的妇女和儿童受到牺牲，使法国很多妇女失掉了丈夫、兄弟和儿子。现在恢复印度支那和平达成协议，我们新疆省各族妇女热烈庆贺印度支那三国和法国的妇女得到和平的生活。（新华社）
