Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, 15th. TASS reported: The Secretariat of the World Federation of Trade Unions issued a statement to the press on the situation in Pakistan. The statement said:

    The Karachi authorities, who are implementing a police terror regime, have been continuously undermining trade union rights and the basic democratic freedoms of the people in Pakistan, especially in East Pakistan, since May this year. Martial law has been imposed nationwide. The army opened fire on the workers of Narayanganj, resulting in 600 deaths and injuries. Trade unions have been dissolved, and the authorities are trying to replace them with organizations that are subservient to them. Hundreds of workers have been imprisoned. Trade unions and other democratic organizations are prohibited from holding meetings and mass rallies. The police are monitoring the workers.

    Obviously, this campaign of terror is a direct result of the US-Pakistan military "aid" agreement signed on May 19th. The American ruling clique, in collusion with the Karachi government, is trying to suppress the Pakistani people in order to turn the country into a base for military aggression. Their aim is to use Pakistan as the foundation for the planned Southeast Asia military bloc. They want to divide Asia and establish an alliance of certain aggressive countries against other countries in Asia.

    The World Federation of Trade Unions has repeatedly protested against this situation of undermining the trade union rights of the working people of Pakistan. Now, in view of the increasingly serious development of events, the World Federation of Trade Unions expresses its stronger protest against the bloodshed in Narayanganj, against the rampant police terror, and against the policy of preparing for war and creating poverty.

    The World Federation of Trade Unions demands the release of all victims of the imprisoned terror tactics and demands respect for trade union rights and democratic rights throughout Pakistan.

    The World Federation of Trade Unions calls on all trade union organizations around the world, whether or not they are members of the World Federation of Trade Unions, to protest to the Karachi authorities and express their active solidarity with the working people of Pakistan.

    世界工联书记处发表声明
    抗议喀喇蚩当局迫害巴基斯坦工人
    【新华社十六日讯】塔斯社维也纳十五日讯：世界工会联合会书记处就巴基斯坦局势向报界发表声明。声明说：
    施行警察恐怖制度的喀喇蚩当局，从今年五月起在巴基斯坦，特别是在东巴基斯坦不断地破坏工会权利和人民的起码民主自由。全国实行了戒严。军队向纳兰加尼耶工人开枪，以致死伤六百人。工会遭到解散，当局想用对它唯命是从的组织来代替工会组织。整百整百的工人被关入监狱。工会和其他民主组织被禁止集会和举行群众大会。警察对工人实行了监督。
    显然，这种恐怖运动是五月十九日签订的美巴军事“援助”协定所直接引起的。美国统治集团勾结喀喇蚩政府竭力镇压巴基斯坦人民，以把这个国家变成实行军事侵略的基地。他们的目的是要使巴基斯坦作为策划中的东南亚军事集团的基础。他们想分裂亚洲，建立某些侵略国家的同盟来反对亚洲的其他国家。
    世界工会联合会不止一次地表示抗议这种破坏巴基斯坦劳动人民工会权利的情形。现在，鉴于事件的发展日趋严重，世界工会联合会特表示更强烈的抗议，抗议纳兰加尼耶的流血事件，抗议放肆的警察恐怖，抗议准备战争和制造贫困的政策。
    世界工会联合会要求释放所有被关入监狱的恐怖手段的受害者，要求在巴基斯坦全国各地尊重工会权利和民主权利。
    世界工会联合会号召全世界所有的工会组织，不论它是否加入世界工联，都向喀喇蚩当局提出抗议，并表示积极声援巴基斯坦劳动人民。
