    People on the Flood Prevention and Rescue Front Lines
    Repairing the Jinkeng Embankment
    The Jinkeng Embankment in Xinjian Township, Lishui County, Jiangsu Province, near Shijiu Lake, is over 700 zhang in length. One night in late June, there was heavy rain, and a strong wind and waves washed away a breach in the southern embankment. At that time, the wind and rain were heavy, and it was dark. The district and township cadres and experienced old farmers discussed and decided to build a 20-plus zhang long dike at the breach to block the water flow, and then rush to plug the breach. The township head led a group of older people to carry equipment, and Liu Zongrong, the director of the township farmers' association, led the youth militia to block the water at the breach. Liu Zongrong led activists such as Hu Youli to jump into the rushing water and use their bodies to block the flow. The masses jumped into the water to drive wooden stakes and dig mud. After a day of intense rescue, they finally built a 20-plus zhang long water-blocking dike, plugging the breach and saving more than 200 mu of farmland and more than 200 houses inside the embankment from any damage.
    Using Waterwheels to Save Fish Fry
    The Wuchang County Local State-Owned First Fish Farm in Hubei Province, next to Qian Lake in Jinkou Town, is located in a very low-lying area. One night, there was a heavy rain, and the fish ponds were flooded with a lot of water, and the fish fry were about to be lost. Wu Zhengfa and ten other farmers from Xindun Township, Third District, who were building dikes at the farm, immediately helped the farm to use three waterwheels to pump water out. However, because of the heavy rain, the amount of water pumped out was not as much as the amount of water that had seeped in, and the outer water level was high, there was a danger of cracks in the dike. They rushed to carry grass, transport soil, and drive piles, and quickly built up the dike. Then, they lifted nets and salvaged 1,428,000 fish fry, providing a strong guarantee for the development of the farm's fishery production next year.
    Overcoming the Seventh Flood
    Recently, the Qingyi River water has risen sharply, and Taiyuan Township, Jing County, Anhui Province, has suffered its seventh flood disaster since rice transplanting this year. This flood was larger than the previous six floods. Before the flood, township cadres, according to the water situation, notified the agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams to fully prepare for dike protection and flood prevention work. More than 50 members of the Taiyuan and Wufang cooperatives were organized into three teams to patrol and inspect the flood control dikes along the river. When they found that a section of the flood control dike near the river had collapsed due to the flood, they mobilized more than 100 people to carry out rescue work in the heavy rain that night.
    When the flood receded, the whole township launched a heat wave of driving piles to block flowing water and washing seedlings. According to preliminary statistics, more than 300 people participated in washing seedlings, washing more than 1,750 mu of seedlings, accounting for 85% of the flooded area. Now, the rice plants are growing well, and the farmers are preparing to apply fertilizer to the severely affected fields and remedy the losses caused by the flood disaster after the weather clears.
    Brave People's Police
    A section of the river embankment near Qilijie outside Zhonghua Gate in Nanjing City collapsed for a length of two zhang due to the rapid rise of the river water, and water was constantly flowing into the farmland. The comrades of the Traffic Police Brigade of the Nanjing Municipal Public Security Bureau, led by Sui Rizhong, the instructor of the Third Squadron, and some comrades from the Fire Brigade, a total of more than 110 people, rushed to the dangerous section. Wang Shenzhan, Wei Jisheng, Zhang Changlin, Li Kuixuan, Wei Hongsheng, Zhao Weiping, Chen Zhihao and more than a dozen others immediately jumped into the water, lay down in the breach, and blocked the water with their bodies. The rest of the people carried yellow mud from a distance to block the breach. After two hours of intense digging and dike building, they finally successfully blocked the breach, ensuring that the farmland would not be damaged.
    Ensuring the Smooth Flow of the Highway
    Not long ago, there was continuous heavy rain in Anfu County, Jiangxi Province, and the river water rose sharply. At a large bridge on the Yong'an Highway, the water level had reached the bridge surface, and many pieces of wood and branches were washed against the bridge, impacting the bridge structure, and the situation was very critical. The members of the Jiang Rongqi Agricultural Production Cooperative, seeing that the state's highway bridge was in danger of being washed away by the flood, immediately rushed to the bridge to carry out rescue work, salvaging and removing the wood and branches blocking the bridge. At that time, the bridge body was constantly shaking, and people on the bridge were in danger of being washed away by the flood along with the bridge. However, the members of the Jiang Rongqi Agricultural Production Cooperative did not shrink back in the slightest. After five or six hours of hard struggle, they finally protected the safety of the bridge and ensured the smooth flow of the highway.
    Thank You for the Workers' Help
    On the morning of June 30th, a breach was washed away in the Xiajiashan Dam of Zhangjiatang, Wuhu City, Anhui Province, and the flood water poured straight towards the rice fields. More than 100 workers from the Sihe Kiln Factory, who were having lunch, immediately put down their bowls when they heard the news of the breach and rushed to Zhangjiatang under the leadership of the factory director and the chairman of the trade union. Within one or two hours, they drove two rows of wooden stakes and filled sacks with mud and threw them into the wooden rafts, blocking the breach. By this time it was already after 2 p.m. Some workers had not eaten enough lunch, but they still insisted on building a solid new dike at the breach until 5 p.m. before returning to the factory.
    The farmers were very moved by the enthusiastic support of the kiln factory workers. They sent representatives to express their condolences and thanks to the workers. They said: If it weren't for the help of the worker elder brothers to repair the breach, more than 3,000 mu of fields would have been flooded.
    Farmers Rescue Railway Bridge
    At more than 5:00 p.m. on June 24th, it rained heavily near Wangguanrentun Station on the Jingbao Railway Line within the jurisdiction of the Beijing Railway Administration. Yang Yongsheng, the Minister of the Armed Forces Department of the local Beishaling District, concerned about the safety of the railway, checked along the roadbed in the rain, and suddenly heard someone shouting: "The rain has flooded the roadbed, come and rescue it!" He rushed to the village and led the militia out of the village to rescue it. The farmers in the village also passed on the message to each other and rushed to Bridge No. 354. At that time, the water had flooded over the bridge and the railway could not be seen. Everyone lined up, arm in arm, and passed stones along the roadbed. Many women also rolled up their trouser legs and joined the battle.
    After the water receded, after inspection, the bridge and roadbed suffered very little damage because they were filled with stones. After only one hour of repair work, railway traffic was smooth again. (Fu Maohuai, Zeng Jianmin)
    Huangjiagang Flood Rescue
    Ren Shunyuan in the Fourteenth District of Xiangyin, Hunan, covers an area of 109 li. It is related to the lives and safety of more than 46,000 people in the yuan and the Chenxi and Nanyang yuans which are closely connected to it, and it is also related to the harvest of 87,000 mu of paddy fields. At dawn on June 30th, the flood violently struck the dike soil. A 60-meter-long dike section of Huangjiagang suddenly sank, and cracks appeared on the dike surface. A row of more than one zhang long piles driven into the bottom of the pond could not withstand the high pressure of the inclined dike soil and broke off flush with the ground. Every few seconds, the dike surface would sink a few centimeters. In the most dangerous section, the dike width was only about one chi left.
    At this most critical moment, Zhou Hanzhang, Deputy Director of the County Cooperative General Society, Zhou Dingguo, Deputy District Chief of the district, and more than 30 members of the Zhou Gantang Squad of Baoshi Township stood on the tiger's mouth and quickly smashed soil blocks, pounded the dike body tightly with hoes, wo spades and wooden sticks, and blocked the flood. Encouraged by their heroic actions, many farmers also gathered together to carry out rescue work. Four new pile frames were quickly erected, and large wooden piles, two zhang and four chi long, were driven deep into the soil; the dike body was gradually raised.
    Each township and village in the Fourteenth District of Xiangyin sent its own company and squad to support Huangjiagang. After seven or eight days of continuous intense fighting, the dangerous dike was finally preserved.
    Now, the houses, vegetable gardens, and groves in Ren Shunyuan are all safe and sound, and tens of thousands of mu of early rice will soon begin to be harvested.

    在防洪抢险战线上的人们
    抢修金坑圩
    江苏省溧水县新建乡靠近石臼湖的金坑圩，全长七百多丈。六月下旬一天夜里下了大雨，大风浪把南边圩堤冲开了一个缺口。当时风大雨大，天又黑，区、乡干部和有经验的老农商量，决定在缺口处筑起一条二十多丈长的埂，将流水拦开来，然后再抢堵缺口。乡长就带领一班年纪大的人搬运器材，乡农会主任刘宗荣带领青年民兵在缺口处挡水。刘宗荣带领积极分子胡友礼等跳入急流，以自己的身体挡着流水。群众都纷纷下水打木桩，挖泥土。经过一天的紧张抢救，终于筑起了一条二十多丈的挡水围堤，把缺口堵塞了起来，使圩内二百多亩农田和二百多间房屋未受一点损失。车水救鱼秧
    湖北省武昌县地方国营第一养鱼场，在金口镇乾湖的旁边，地势很低，一天夜里，下了一场大雨，鱼池里灌了很多水，眼看鱼秧就要受到损失。三区新墩乡在该场做堤的农民吴正发等十一人，当即帮助该场用三乘水车往外车水。但因为雨大，车出的水没有渍的多，加上外围的水势高，堤埂有缺裂的危险。他们又抢着背草、挑土、打桩，很快就把堤埂筑好了。接着又抬网打捞起鱼秧一百四十二万八千尾，给该场明年渔业生产的发展提供了有力的保证。
    战胜了第七次洪水
    近来，青弋江江水暴涨，安徽省泾县太园乡又遭受了今年自栽秧以来的第七次洪水灾害。这次洪水，比前六次洪水都要大。涨水前，乡干部根据水情，通知各农业生产合作社和互助组充分做好准备，进行护堤防洪工作。太园、五房两社的五十多个社员，分别编成三个小队，在沿江防洪堤上来回巡逻、检查。当他们发现靠江的防洪堤，被洪水冲塌了一段缺口，就连夜发动了一百多人冒着大雨进行抢救。
    当洪水退却的时候，全乡又掀起了打桩挡溜水和洗苗的热潮。据初步统计，全乡参加洗苗的有三百多人，共洗苗一千七百五十多亩，占被淹田亩面积的百分之八十五。现在，稻棵生长良好，农民准备在天晴后，给受灾较严重的田追施肥料，补救洪水灾害所造成的损失。
    勇敢的人民警察
    南京市中华门外七里街附近的一段河堤，因河水猛涨，有两丈长的地方下塌了，水不断向农田里流。南京市公安局交通警察大队部的同志在三中队指导员隋日忠的率领下，和消防大队的部分同志，共一百一十多人赶到了这个险段。王慎战、魏济生、张长林、李魁轩、魏洪生、赵维屏、陈志浩等十几个人立刻跳下水去，一个个躺在决口的地方，用身体把水挡住，其余的人便从很远的地方搬来了黄泥，堵塞缺口。经过两个小时紧张地挖泥、筑堤，终于胜利地堵住了缺口，保障了农田不受损失。
    保证了公路的畅通
    不久前，江西省安福县连降大雨，河水猛涨，永安公路有一座大桥，水位已达桥面，桥边又冲来许多木材、树枝，冲击桥身，情况非常危急。蒋荣期农业生产合作社的社员们看见国家的公路桥梁有被洪水冲倒的危险，立即赶往桥上进行抢救，打捞清除阻在桥身上的木材、树枝，当时桥身不断摇摆，人在桥上随时有连人带桥被洪水冲走的可能，但蒋荣期农业生产合作社的社员们丝毫没有畏缩，经过五、六个钟头的艰苦斗争，终于保护了桥身的安全，保证了公路的畅通。
    感谢工人的帮助
    六月三十日上午，安徽省芜湖市张家塘夏家山坝被水冲破了一个缺口，洪水向着稻田直泻。正在吃中饭的四褐窑厂一百多工人，一听到破坝消息，立即放下饭碗，在厂长和工会主席带领下向张家塘奔去。在一两个钟头内，他们就打起了两排木桩，并把麻袋装满泥土丢进木排内，堵住了缺口。这时已是下午两点多钟了，有的工人中饭没有吃饱，但他们仍然坚持在缺口处筑成一道坚固的新堤，直到五点钟才回厂。
    农民对窑厂工人的热情支援非常感动。他们派代表向工人们慰问致谢。他们说：要不是工人老大哥帮我们抢修，三千多亩田准会给水淹没。
    农民抢救铁路桥梁
    六月二十四日下午五点多钟，北京铁路管理局管内，京包线王官人屯车站附近雨下得很大。当地背沙岭区武装部部长杨永胜，关心铁路的安全，就冒雨顺着路基检查，忽然听见有人喊：“雨水漫路基囉，快来抢救啊！”他便急忙跑到村里，带领民兵出村抢救，村中的农民也互相传信，向三百五十四号桥赶来。当时水已漫过桥梁，看不见铁路了，大家就排成队，互相挽着胳臂，顺路基传递石块，有很多妇女也卷起裤腿，参加了战斗。
    水退下去以后，经过检查，桥梁、路基因为填了石块，损失很小。仅经过一小时的修复工作，铁路行车便又畅通。（傅茂槐　曾健民）
    黄家港抢险
    湖南湘阴十四区的仁顺垸，方圆一百零九里。它关系着垸内和紧紧毗连着它的城西、南阳两垸四万六千多人的生命安全，也关系着八万七千亩稻田的收成。六月三十号，天刚亮。洪水猛烈地打击着堤土，黄家港段六十公尺长的堤堘突然下沉，堤面上出现了开坼现象，打入塘底的一排一丈多长的桩木，经不住下倾堤土的高压，齐地面折断了。每隔几秒钟，堤面就下沉几公分，最危险的地段，堤宽只剩下一尺左右了。
    在这最危急的时候，县合作总社副主任周汉章、该区副区长周定国和包市乡周干堂分队的三十多人，都站在虎口上用锄头、窝锹、木棍迅速打碎土块、捶紧堤身，阻挡洪水。在他们英勇行动的鼓舞下很多农民也都集合起来，进行抢险工作。四个新的桩架很快竖起来了，二丈四尺长的粗大木桩深深打入了土中；堤身逐渐培高了起来。
    湘阴十四区各乡各村都派出了自己的中队和小队来支援黄家港。经过连续七、八天紧张战斗，终于保住了险堤。
    现在，仁顺垸内的民房、菜地、树丛全部安全无恙，数万亩早稻马上就要开始收割。
