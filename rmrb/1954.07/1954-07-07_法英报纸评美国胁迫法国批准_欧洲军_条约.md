Xinhua News Agency, July 6th. According to a TASS dispatch from Paris on the 5th: French newspapers are commenting with anxiety that foreign pressure to make France accelerate the ratification of the "European Army" treaty is increasing.

Political observers unanimously believe that the current pressure comes from Washington, London, and Bonn. To influence France, a frightening argument has been brought up again: if the French parliament does not immediately agree to establish the "European Army," a separate German "Defense Force" will be re-established.

The newspapers point out that the United States has expressed undisguised satisfaction with Adenauer's recent threatening statement. However, the reaction in France is different, as can be seen from the French government's decision to postpone indefinitely the visit of Foreign Ministry Undersecretary, Mr. Gillaud de Beaumont, to Bonn and his meeting with Adenauer. According to newspaper reports, this decision has aroused the dissatisfaction of the Bonn ruling group.

French newspapers report that the United Kingdom and the United States will hold a meeting at the British Foreign Office on July 5th to discuss the restoration of Bonn Germany's "sovereignty," regardless of whether the Paris Treaty is ratified. Newspapers note with annoyance that French representatives were not invited to participate in this meeting, although the issues to be discussed are of vital importance to France. "Combat" states: "The French government will only be consulted. The disregard and lack of courtesy toward France is so great that it raises the question: are Britain and the United States willing to have Bonn and Taiwan, two tools that are more obedient in implementing the policy of international tension, rather than France?"

"Perspectives," a weekly reflecting the views of influential French industrialists, states that if one wants to understand the steps taken by foreign countries to put pressure on France, it is enough to cite the following examples: "A letter to President Coty, Washington's statements, many remarks by West German Chancellor Adenauer, pressure on the French Prime Minister to agree to participate in the six-nation conference before July 20th, to refuse to consider amending the treaty before ratification, to appeal to Washington, and finally, the shameless speech of the American ambassador to Paris, Mr. Dillon, who recklessly interfered in our internal affairs and issued an ultimatum to us."

"Perspectives" concludes by saying that the interests of Europe and the whole world require the establishment of a "truly independent Europe that includes more than thirty European countries."

Xinhua News Agency, July 6th. According to a TASS dispatch from London on the 5th: "The Observer" comments on Adenauer's broadcast speech on July 2nd, believing it to be "Adenauer's ultimatum regarding the European Defense Community."

The newspaper published a dispatch from its Bonn correspondent, Haefner, who wrote, "Adenauer is practically putting a gun to France's head, telling it to either ratify the European Defense Community in its current form or be willing to see an unrestricted rearmament of a fully sovereign Germany."... Commenting on the relationship between German rearmament and the internal situation in West Germany, Haefner said that Adenauer "is gradually losing internal support in West Germany."

The foreign correspondent of "Reynold's News" wrote: "Adenauer's ultimatum to France on July 2nd was due to the fact that the United States indicated to the West German Chancellor last week that if France does not ratify the European Defense Community in the coming weeks, the United States will decide to sign a new treaty with Germany. This new treaty... will allow Germany to establish an independent army."

The reporter continued: "Since the end of the Washington talks, the State Department has been convinced that Britain is willing to sign a new treaty. If France objects – which is very likely – France will be excluded from this treaty. Either that, or strong pressure will be put on France to force Prime Minister Mendes-France to resign and be replaced by a more obedient Prime Minister."

The "Reynold's News" editorial pointed out: The only issue affirmed by the Anglo-American joint statement is the issue of German rearmament. The editorial said: "No matter what France does, Germany will be rearmed anyway, despite all the dangerous consequences of dismaying Western Europe and reviving Germany's desire for domination." The newspaper called for a parliamentary debate on the joint statement.

### 法英报纸评美国胁迫法国批准“欧洲军”条约

    法英报纸评美国胁迫法国批准“欧洲军”条约
   【新华社六日讯】据塔斯社巴黎五日讯：法国报纸忧心忡忡地评论说，外国为使法国加速批准“欧洲军”条约，对法国施加的压力越来越大了。
    政治观察家一致认为，目前压力来自华盛顿、伦敦和波恩。为了影响法国，又把一种吓人的说法提出来了：假如法国议会不立刻同意建立“欧洲军”的话，就要重新建立起一支独立的德国的“国防军”。
    各报指出，对于阿登纳最近的威胁性声明，美国表示了毫不掩饰的满意。不过在法国引起的反应却不同，从法国政府决定无限期推迟外交部次长吉兰·德波蒙访问波恩和阿登纳会谈这件事可以看出这一点。据报纸消息说，这个决定已经引起了波恩统治集团的不满。
    法国报纸报道说，英美两国将于七月五日在英国外交部举行会议，讨论恢复波恩德国的“主权”的问题，不论巴黎条约是否获得批准。报纸烦恼地指出，法国代表没有被邀请参加这个会议，虽然将要讨论的问题对法国有切身重要性。“战斗报”说：“法国政府将仅被咨询。对法国的重视和礼貌太差了，以致产生了这样的问题：英国和美国是不是情愿要波恩和台湾这两个在执行国际紧张局势政策时比较听话的工具，而不要法国了呢？”
    反映有影响的法国工业界人士意见的“展望周报”说，假如要了解外国对法国施压力的步骤，那么只要举出这样一些事例来就够了：“写给戈蒂总统的信，华盛顿声明，西德总理阿登纳的许多言论，对法国总理施加压力要他同意在七月二十日以前参加六国会议，要他拒绝考虑在批准条约以前修改条约问题，要他求告华盛顿，最后还有美国驻巴黎大使狄龙的厚颜无耻的演说，他肆无忌惮地干涉我们的内部事务，并向我们提出最后通牒。”
    “展望周报”最后说，欧洲和全世界的利益要求建立一个“包括三十多个欧洲国家的真正独立的欧洲”。
    【新华社六日讯】据塔斯社伦敦五日讯：“观察家报”评论阿登纳七月二日发表的广播演说，认为这是“阿登纳关于欧洲防务集团的最后通牒”。
    报纸刊载了它驻波恩记者哈弗纳的一篇通讯，他写道，“阿登纳实际上是把手枪对准法国的头，告诉它要就是批准目前形式的欧洲防务集团，要就是甘愿看到一个有充分主权的德国的无限制的重新武装。”……哈弗纳在评论德国的重新武装和西德内部局势的关系时说，阿登纳“正渐渐失去西德的内部支持”。
    “雷诺新闻”的外交记者写道：“阿登纳七月二日向法国提出最后通牒，是由于美国上星期向西德总理表示，如果法国在今后几星期中还不批准欧洲防务集团的话，美国就决定和德国签订一项新条约。这项新条约……将准许德国建立一支独立的军队。”
    记者继续说：“自从华盛顿会谈结束以来，国务院一直相信英国愿意签订一个新的条约。如果法国表示反对的话——这是很可能的——法国将被排斥于这个条约之外。要末就是对法国施加强大的压力，使孟戴斯—弗朗斯总理辞职，代之以一个更加听话的总理。”
      “雷诺新闻”的社论指出：英美会谈联合声明加以肯定的唯一问题是德国重新武装问题。社论说：“不论法国怎么做，德国总归要重新武装，尽管有使西欧感到沮丧和复活德国的统治欲望的一切危险后果。”报纸要求对联合声明进行议会辩论。
