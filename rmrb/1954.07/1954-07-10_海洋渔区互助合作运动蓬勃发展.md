The mutual aid and cooperation movement in marine fishing areas across the country is developing vigorously. According to incomplete statistics, there are now more than 300 fishing production cooperatives, an increase of more than six times compared to the end of last year. The northern coastal areas have developed faster. Liaodong Province has developed 19 fishing production cooperatives. Most major fishing villages with concentrated fishermen in various counties have one or two cooperatives, and more than 1,700 mutual aid teams have been developed. Liaoxi Province organized 90 fishing production cooperatives and 145 mutual aid teams at the time of the spring fishing season. There are now 56 fishing production cooperatives in the North China coastal area. Including mutual aid teams, the number of fishermen organized has reached half of the total labor force of fishermen, and seven basically collectivized fishing villages have emerged. A total of 89 fishing production cooperatives in Shandong Province participated in spring fishing production, four times more than last year. Zhejiang Province has also organized more than 30 fishing production cooperatives.
After the fishermen were organized, they demonstrated superiority in production. Fishermen's organizations in the Changshan Islands of Shandong Province send four small boats with each large boat to fish in the far sea, helping each other, which greatly increases the catch of small boats. In the mutual aid team of fishermen on Hailimen Lidao Island in Chaoyang County, Guangdong Province, the average income per boat was more than 2 million yuan in 20 hauls, which was 41% more than the single-handed fishing boat with the highest income in the entire port. Fishermen in Qikou District, Huanghua County, Hebei Province, have accumulated funds by organizing and developing production, and have added 64 new boats and more than 2,900 new nets this year. The increase exceeds the highest record in local history.

    海洋渔区互助合作运动蓬勃发展
    【本报讯】全国海洋渔区互助合作运动蓬勃发展，据不完全统计，现在已有渔业生产合作社三百多个，比去年年底增加六倍多。发展较快的是北方沿海地区，辽东省已发展了十九个渔业生产合作社，各县渔民集中的主要渔村都有一个至两个社，互助组已发展到一千七百多个。辽西省在春汛下海时即已组成九十个渔业生产合作社，一百四十五个互助组。华北沿海现已有渔业生产合作社五十六个，连互助组在内，组织起来的渔民已达渔民总劳动力数的一半，并出现了七个基本上合作化的渔村。山东省参加春汛生产的渔业生产合作社共有八十九个，比去年增加四倍。浙江省也组织了三十多个渔业生产合作社。
    渔民组织起来以后，在生产中显示了优越性。山东省长山列岛的渔民组织，每只大船带四只小船到远海捕鱼，互相帮助，使小船捕鱼量大大提高。广东省潮阳县海门犁岛渔民互助组，在二十次下网中，平均每只船收入二百多万元，比全港收入最多的单干渔船多百分之四十一。河北省黄骅县岐口区渔民由于组织起来发展生产，积累资金，今年增加了新船六十四只，新网两千九百多片，增加的数字超过了当地历史上最高纪录。
