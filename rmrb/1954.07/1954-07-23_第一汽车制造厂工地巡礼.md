The construction of China's First Automobile Works is proceeding day and night. At dawn, as the sun's rays begin to shine, many large trucks carry workers from all directions to the construction site. The massive group of buildings comes closer and closer, and the large red banners hanging on the roof frames appear particularly clear: "Resolutely implement Chairman Mao's instructions, and ensure the completion of the plant construction task on time!" "Comrades! Strive to contribute your strength to the construction of China's first automobile factory!" "No difficulty can stop our working class!" These heroic words inspire millions of builders. People get out of the cars and climb onto the roof frames that are dozens of meters high, and onto the tower cranes and cranes that are more than 30 meters high. Dump trucks filled with concrete, and scrapers filled with dirt, form lines and lines, constantly moving back and forth like huge conveyor belts... The sound of broadcasts, the sound of car horns, and the sound of train whistles suddenly liven up this vast construction site.

When the groundbreaking ceremony for China's first automobile factory was held here on July 15, 1953, all that could be seen was a rolling wilderness, dotted with small shacks made of wooden boards and straw mats. In the temporary office building of the factory headquarters, only a blueprint of the automobile factory could be seen. But today, the initial hardships and messiness of the factory construction have passed, and the appearance of the construction site is changing with each passing day. Now, what is presented before us is already the prototype of an automobile factory. After a year of construction, dozens of huge buildings have been erected here. Surrounding and connecting these huge projects are the railways and highways that are being built crisscrossing each other. From the roof of the processing plant in the west, we can see a brand-new factory building in the southwest corner of the factory area, which is the woodworking shop that manufactures car bodies, completed one month ahead of schedule on "July 1st"; looking east from here, there are rows and rows of orange-red steel roof frames, and around the roof frames, workers are building very thick walls. The largest of these buildings is the general assembly workshop, surrounded by workshops and warehouses for manufacturing various parts of automobiles. A batch of these projects will be completed successively in the third quarter. As the main power source of the entire factory, the civil engineering and installation of the thermal power plant are progressing simultaneously. The residential area surrounding the southeast of the factory area has been organized and built into more than 40 high-rise buildings according to the street area. This year, welfare facilities such as staff dormitories, shops, nurseries, and schools, and bathhouses have already started construction. This year is a decisive year for striving to complete the factory construction task according to the specified time, and now it is the most intense construction season of the year. From the frequent dispatch telephone conferences of the construction site command, it can be heard that the leaders of each work area are formulating new measures every day to speed up construction; managers and chief engineers are also constantly issuing new instructions to them from the dispatch telephone.

When the reporter walked to the construction site, he was blocked by the vehicles coming and going. The traffic police standing in the center of the crossroads of the factory area kept gesturing, directing the cars and carriages like flowing water to pass through. Every two hours, trains carrying materials and machines enter the railway station. We arrived at the thermal power plant construction site, which is the tallest building on the entire construction site. The newly installed red steel roof frame sets off the blue sky, appearing particularly majestic. This thermal power plant started winter construction in January this year, and since then, regardless of rain or shine, day or night, the project has been progressing intensely. Soviet experts, company managers, and engineers come to see its progress almost every day. The director of this work area, Qi Tao, is a female comrade. She often braves gale-force winds to climb onto the roof frame that is more than 30 meters high to direct workers to insist on continuous pouring of concrete pillars in one operation. One night, a strong wind suddenly blew, and many rain sheds and shacks were blown down. The wind blew harder and harder, and people could hardly stand on the operating table. She still directed the workers in the strong wind to rescue the shacks and insist on construction, ensuring that this thermal power plant would bring light and heat to all the factory staff and workers this winter.

At the construction site of the forging workshop, we saw a group of vigorous warriors on and under the steel roof frame. They were a new force that joined the country's industrial construction last year. From the interviews, we learned that when they first arrived at this construction site, they did not even recognize cranes, roof frames, and connecting beams, but their spirit of hard study was really moving: the soldiers of the Fourth Squadron, who were in charge of the installation and hoisting project, did not know how to work at heights when installing and hoisting pillars that were dozens of meters high and roof frames that were dozens of meters wide. With the help of more than a dozen old workers, they used the rest time at night to select comrades who could climb trees to climb chimneys that were dozens of meters high near the dormitory to train for high-altitude operations. At the beginning of the installation and hoisting project, they installed and hoisted a steel pillar in 40 minutes. Now they have mastered the installation and hoisting technology, and it only takes 9 minutes to install and hoist a pillar. In order to welcome "July 1st", they constantly created new records in installation and hoisting work. On June 27, we saw the fourth and fifth groups of the Fourth Squadron launched a moving competition: at 9:00 a.m., the broadcast announced: "The fourth group has installed and hoisted twelve pillars, and the fifth group has installed and hoisted eleven pillars." The soldiers of the fifth group panicked and sent people to see how the fourth group was installing them. After a while, the announcer broadcasted again: "It is now 10:10, the fifth group has installed and hoisted seventeen pillars, and the fourth group has installed and hoisted fifteen pillars." As soon as the fourth group heard this, they desperately rushed, saying: "Yesterday we installed forty pillars, ahead of the fifth group, and we can't fall behind today." In the afternoon, the broadcast announced the results: the fourth group installed forty-four pillars, and the fifth group installed forty-two pillars. The fourth group improved by four pillars compared to the original, and the fifth group improved by five pillars compared to the original. Both overfulfilled their tasks.

On the night of "July 1st", we walked into the spacious and bright woodworking shop. A grand completion ceremony was being held in this earliest completed factory building. More than 50 advanced workers and more than a dozen model groups who were rewarded at the conference were unspeakably excited to see the factory building that they had built through their hard work in the past year. A woodworking foreman said excitedly: I have never seen such a large factory building project before, let alone done it myself. Worker Zhang Wengui regarded participating in the construction of the woodworking shop as attending a school. He has already mastered the mechanized construction technology from the construction process of this factory building.

We came out of the woodworking shop late at night and walked to the construction site under countless electric lights and floodlights. The deputy engineer of the dispatch room led us through the steel frame forging workshop. At this time, we saw rows and rows of soldiers transmitting red bricks to the high altitude. A soldier holding a gun and guarding us introduced: "The living room of the forging workshop started construction in May, and the plan has been overfulfilled every ten days. Recently, it has been raining every day, and the roads are too slippery. The temporary workers can't supply the bricks to keep up with the speed of the soldiers' bricklaying. Each squadron has drawn a part of the people to prepare for tomorrow's construction tasks."

We came out of the forging workshop and passed through the central avenue of the factory area, and were immediately attracted by the noisy voices and flashing lights. One car after another, under the command of the traffic police, constantly drove into the living room of the general assembly workshop. We found the Kou section chief of the living room section in the basement that was more than one zhang deep. He was directing the steel workers to complete the binding of the last two rib steel bars in the south living room. He and the deputy section chief divided the work and were on duty at night, striving to complete the hundreds of meters long living room from the underground foundation project to the ground within one day and one night. When we walked to the corner of the east living room through a very long assembly workshop, we found Deputy Section Chief Zhou in the crowd who was busy assigning concrete workers to pour the first layer of reinforced concrete floor slab of the east living room. He should have been on duty during the day and should have rested at night. We asked him why he was not resting yet. This tireless section chief explained: "The work of laying the reinforced concrete floor slab only started this morning, and we must thoroughly implement the operating methods to the workers, so that the work will be smooth!"

When we left the construction site, it was already one o'clock in the morning. The earth was shrouded in darkness, but the construction site that was gradually moving away behind us was like a city at night, with the singing of the broadcast and the sound of labor.

    第一汽车制造厂工地巡礼
    新华社记者　任冰如　张光
    我国第一汽车制造厂的建设正在日夜不停地进行着。黎明，太阳刚刚放射出光芒，许多大卡车就载着工人从四周驰向工地。巨大建筑物群越来越近了，高悬在屋架上的红色大幅标语显得特别清晰：“坚决执行毛主席的指示，保证按时完成建厂任务！”“同志们！为建设我国第一座汽车厂而努力贡献出自己的力量吧！”“任何困难阻挡不住我们工人阶级！”这些豪迈的语句，激动着千万个建设者们。人们走出汽车，爬上了几十公尺高的屋架，跨上了三十多公尺高的塔式起重机、吊车。装满混凝土的自卸汽车、装满泥土的铲运机等一列一列地、接连不断地像巨大的传运带似的来往奔驰……。广播声、汽车喇叭声、火车的汽笛声，顿时使这一片广阔的工地活跃起来了。
    当一九五三年七月十五日在这里举行我国第一座汽车厂奠基典礼时，人们所能看到的还只是一片起伏的旷野，其中散布着一些用木板和席子盖起来的小小工棚。在厂部的临时办公大楼里，也只能看见一座汽车厂的蓝图。可是今天，那建厂初期的艰苦和杂乱情形已经过去了，工地面貌正日新月异地在变化着。现在，展示在我们面前的已经是一座汽车厂的雏型了。经过一年建设，这里已经竖立起来几十项巨大的建筑物。环绕和连接这些巨大工程的，是正在建设的纵横交错的铁路、公路。从西面加工厂的屋顶上，我们可以看见厂区西南角上有一座崭新的厂房，这就是提前一个月在“七一”建设成的制造汽车车厢的木工场；由这里向东看，有一排一排丛立着的橙红色的钢屋架，在屋架的周围，工人们正在砌起很厚的墙壁。这些建筑物中最大的要数总装配工场，围绕总装配工场的是制造汽车各个部件的工场和仓库，这些工程有一批将相继在第三季度建成。作为全厂主要动力的热电站，土木建筑和安装工程正齐头并进。环绕厂区东南的住宅区，已经按照街区组织建设起来了四十多栋高楼房。今年职工宿舍、商店、托儿所、学校、浴池等福利设施，已经动工兴建。今年，对争取按照指定时间完成建厂任务来说，是有决定性的一年，而现在正是今年最紧张的施工季节，从工地指挥所频繁的调度电话会议上，可以听出各工区的领导者每天都在为加紧施工而制定新的措施；经理和总工程师也从调度电话上不断向他们发布新的指示。
    当记者走向施工现场时，被来往的车辆阻挡了前进的道路。站在厂区十字大道中心的交通警察，不停地打着手势，指挥着像流水一样的汽车、马车通过，火车站上每两小时就有载着材料和机器的火车开进。我们到了热电站工地，这是全工地最高的建筑物，刚刚装吊起来的红色钢屋架，衬托着蔚蓝色的天空，显得格外雄伟。这座热电站从今年一月起就开始冬季施工，以后不分下雨天晴，不分白天黑夜，工程都在紧张地进展着。苏联专家和公司经理、工程师几乎每天都来看它的进展情形。这个工区的主任齐涛，是一位女同志，她经常冒着八级大风爬上三十多公尺高的屋架，指挥工人坚持进行混凝土柱子连续一次浇灌的操作。一天晚上突然刮来大风，许多雨棚和工棚都被风吹坏了，风越吹越大，人们在操作台上几乎站不住了，她仍在大风中指挥工人抢救工棚，坚持施工，保证这座热电站在今年冬季给全厂职工带来光和热。
    在锻工场的工地上，我们看到了在钢屋架上下的一群生龙活虎般的勇士，他们是去年投入祖国工业建设的一支生力军。从访问中，我们知道他们初到这个工地时，连吊车、屋架、连接梁桁条等都不认识，但他们刻苦钻研的精神实在感动人：担任装吊工程的四中队战士，在装吊几十公尺高的柱子和几十公尺宽的屋架时，全队没有一个人会高空作业。他们在十多个老工人帮助下，利用晚上休息时间，选出会爬树的同志在宿舍附近爬几十公尺高的烟囱，来锻炼高空作业。在装吊工程开始时，他们四十分钟装吊一根钢柱子，现在他们已经掌握了装吊技术，只要九分钟就能装吊一根柱子。他们为了迎接“七一”，不断创造出装吊工作的新纪录。六月二十七日，我们看到了四中队的第四组和第五组展开了一场动人的竞赛：上午九时广播中宣告：“四组已经装吊了十二根，五组装吊了十一根。”五组的战士着慌了，派人去看四组是怎样装的。一会，广播员又广播了：“现在是十点十分，五组装吊了十七根，四组装吊了十五根。”四组一听就拚命赶，他们说：“昨天我们装了四十根，赶在五组前面，今天不能落后。”下午广播宣告了结果：四组装了四十四根，五组装了四十二根，四组比原来提高四根，五组比原来提高了五根。都超额完成了任务。
      “七一”夜晚，我们走进宽敞明亮的木工场。这座最早竣工的厂房里正在隆重举行落成典礼。五十多个受到大会奖励的先进工人和十多个模范小组，看到自己一年来辛勤劳动建设起来的厂房，都有说不出的兴奋。一位木工工长满怀兴奋地说：建筑这么大的厂房工程，过去甭说亲手做，就是看也没看见过。工人张文贵把参加木工场的建设当作进了一次学校。他已经从这座厂房的建设过程中掌握了机械化施工技术。
    我们深夜里从木工场出来，在无数电灯和投光灯下走向工地。调度室的副工程师领着我们穿过钢架林立的锻工场，这时我们看到一排一排的战士在向高空中传送红砖。一位端着枪担负守卫的战士向我们介绍：“锻工场的生活间，从五月份动工，每旬都超额完成了计划。最近每天下雨，道路太滑，临时工人运砖供应不上战士们砌砖的速度，每个中队都抽出一部分人来为明天的施工任务做好准备工作。”
    我们从锻工场出来，经过厂区中央大道，立刻被嘈杂的人声和闪烁的灯光吸引住了。一辆接着一辆的汽车，在交通警察指挥之下，不断开进总装配工场的生活间。我们从一丈多深的地下室里，找到了生活间工段的寇段长。他正在指挥钢筋工人完成南生活间最后两段肋形钢筋的绑扎工作。他和副段长分工，在夜晚值班，争取在一天一夜之内把几百公尺长的生活间从地下基础工程做上地面来。当我们穿过很长的装配车间走到东生活间的拐角时，又从人群中发现周副段长正忙着分配混凝土工人浇灌东生活间第一层钢筋混凝土楼板。他白天值班，晚上应该休息，我们问他为什么还不休息，这位不知疲乏的工段长解释说：“打钢筋混凝土楼板的工作今天上午才开始，一定要把操作方法向工人贯彻好，工作才会顺手！”
    当我们离开工地时，已经是深夜一点钟了。大地笼罩着黑暗，但在我们身后渐渐远了的这个工地如同一座入夜的城市，有着广播的歌声，有着劳动的响声。
