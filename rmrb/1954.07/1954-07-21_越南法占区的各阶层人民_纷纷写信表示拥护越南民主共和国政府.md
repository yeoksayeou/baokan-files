    Xinhua News Agency, 20th: According to Vietnam News Agency on the 17th: The people in the French-occupied areas of Vietnam, passing through layers of French military lines and high mountains and rivers, sent letters to President Ho Chi Minh, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and the National Committee of the Vietnam National United Front, expressing their support for the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

    Among the hundreds of letters already received, some were written by farmers in remote rural areas of Hai Ninh Province in North Vietnam, some by small merchants in Hanoi, and others from various provinces in Central Vietnam and all parts of South Vietnam. The letters bear the signatures of people from all regions.

    Residents of a village in the French-occupied area of Khanh Hoa Province in Central Vietnam wrote to President Ho Chi Minh: Although we live under the enemy's guns, we have always been looking forward to you and the (Democratic Republic of Vietnam) government, and no force can shake our determination. We are determined to fight against the enemy's forced conscription. We fully support the proposals put forward by the delegation of our people's government at the Geneva Conference for the restoration of peace on our beloved Vietnamese land.

    Three hundred residents of Van Dinh in Ha Dong Province, North Vietnam, wrote in a letter before they were recently liberated: The French colonial army used American-made bombs and shells to bomb and shoot at our area, killing more than two hundred of our relatives and burning down more than three hundred houses. The enemy imposed heavy taxes on us, and we had to work day and night, but the life we ​​lived was miserable. They expressed the hope that the Geneva Conference would reach a peace agreement so that they could live in tranquility and peace.

    A woman living in Kinh Mon County, in the French-occupied area of ​​Guang'an Province, North Vietnam, had her husband and two sons killed by the enemy. She wrote a letter to the chief representative of the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam attending the Geneva Conference, denouncing the US imperialists and French colonialists for destroying her family's happiness, and expressing her support for the policy of the Republic government.
