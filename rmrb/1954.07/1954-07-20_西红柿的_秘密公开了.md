    "The 'Secret' of Tomatoes Revealed"
    In the "Enthusiastic People for Socialist Undertakings" column of the Shandong Rural Mass Newspaper on May 7th, an article titled "The 'Secret' of Tomatoes Revealed" was published. Through the fact that Zhang Shiqian, a farmer from Jimo County, made public the methods of cultivating tomatoes, it illustrates that through the collectivist education of cooperatives, farmers' individualistic thoughts are constantly being overcome, and new socialist ideas are constantly growing. People who were originally conservative and selfish have now become advanced producers who actively strive for the public good.
    The article describes Zhang Shiqian's ideological transformation process. The tomatoes grown by Zhang Shiqian ripened half a month earlier than others every year, and he could sell them for twice the price. Others wanted to learn from his experience and asked him, "How do you manage your tomatoes?" He said, "I don't have any good methods. I just planted them a few days earlier and applied more fertilizer." When cultivating tomato seedlings, he secretly worked in the backyard. However, after he joined the agricultural production cooperative, he was often educated in collectivism and patriotism, and this contradiction between his individualism and the collective interests of the members aroused inner struggle. At first, he was reluctant to reveal the secret of raising seedlings. He remembered that when he was researching this method, he even took the glass off the lanterns at home to use. Later, when he had advanced methods for cultivating tomatoes, tomatoes became his "cash cow," and he was unwilling to tell anyone the secret. But when he thought of what the cooperative cadres said, "Every member has a share in the cooperative's increase or decrease in production. Members actively thinking of ways to increase production is for everyone, for themselves, and also for the country," he felt that his idea of only planning for himself was very wrong. He launched an ideological struggle, and finally overcame individualistic thoughts, "determined to pass on the 'secret' of the past few years to the cooperative."
    After Zhang Shiqian's ideological transformation, what was his actual performance? This is what readers are most concerned about. The article answers this question through the facts of Zhang Shiqian's socialist labor attitude. The article writes: "Based on the principle of sprouting sweet potatoes on a warm kang, he designed a greenhouse seedling cultivation method," "Since the tomato seeds were sown, he gets up at eleven o'clock every night to light the fire, watching the mercury column on the thermometer, so as not to let the (greenhouse) temperature be too high or too low." The enthusiasm and creativity displayed by Zhang Shiqian for the collective interests of the members, as described in the article, have a great impact and education on readers.
    The article also writes about Zhang Shiqian's grand ideals under the education of socialist thought, and the efforts he has made to realize these ideals. After listening to the propaganda of the general task of the state during the transition period, a beautiful picture often appeared in Zhang Shiqian's mind: "A few years later, a collective farm was established... Larger and more beautiful greenhouses are built in the farm, not only to raise seedlings, but also to let tomatoes, cucumbers and other vegetables bloom beautiful flowers and bear fruitful fruits in the greenhouses in the middle of winter; maybe I will become an agronomist at that time." It is precisely under the impetus of this ideal that "he once ran dozens of miles to the suburbs of Qingdao to learn how to prune fruit trees"; and bought books such as "Beijing Vegetable Varieties and Their Cultivation Methods" and "Michurin's Collected Works," working during the day and studying at night, and if he didn't understand something, he would run several miles to the prefectural farm to ask for advice.
    After publishing this article, the Rural Mass Newspaper continued to praise the high school graduate who served as a breeder in the agricultural production cooperative, and the good accountant of the agricultural production cooperative, in this column on May 10th and 19th. Farmers' newspapers pay attention to reflecting the growth of socialist thinking of the peasant masses, and setting up good examples among the peasant masses, which will undoubtedly help educate and promote the gradual realization of the socialist transformation of agriculture.

### “西红柿的‘秘密’公开了”

    “西红柿的‘秘密’公开了”
    在五月七日山东农村大众报的“热心社会主义事业的人们”一栏内，登载了一篇题目叫做“西红柿的‘秘密’公开了”的通讯。它通过即墨县农民张式玕把栽培西红柿的方法公开了的事实，说明经过合作社集体主义的教育，农民的个人主义思想不断地被克服，新的社会主义思想不断在成长；原来是保守自私的人，现在变成了为公共利益而积极努力的先进生产者。
    通讯描述了张式玕的思想转变过程。张式玕种的西红柿，年年比别人的早熟半个月，能卖双份钱。别人想向他学经验，问他：“你的西红柿是咋摆弄的？”他说：“我也没有什么好办法，就是早种了几天，多施了点肥。”在育西红柿苗时，他偷偷地在后院里干。可是当他参加了农业生产合作社后，经常受到了集体主义和爱国主义的教育，他的这种个人主义和社员集体利益的矛盾，就引起了内心的斗争。起初他对育苗的秘诀还是舍不得拿出来，他想起自己在研究这个办法时，把家里灯笼上的玻璃都拆下来使了，后来他有了栽培西红柿的先进方法，西红柿成了他的“摇钱树”，他就不愿把秘密告诉人。但是当他想到社里干部说的“社里增产减产每个社员都有份，社员们积极想法增产，这是为大家，为自己，也是为国家”的时候，就觉着自己只为个人打算的想法很不对头。他在思想上展开了斗争，最后终于战胜了个人主义思想，“决心把几年来的‘秘密’传给社里”。
    张式玕的思想转变后，他的实际表现是怎样呢？这是读者所最关心的。通讯通过张式玕的社会主义劳动态度的事实，来回答了这个问题。通讯写道：“他根据在热炕上生地瓜芽的道理，设计出了一种温室育苗办法”，“自从西红柿下种以后，他每天夜里十一点起来烧火，两眼注视着寒暑表上的水银柱，不使（温室）温度太高或太低”。通讯所描述的张式玕为了社员的集体利益所发挥的积极性和创造性，对读者的感受和教育是很大的。
    通讯也写出了张式玕在社会主义思想教育下的远大理想，和为实现这些理想所作的努力。张式玕在听了国家过渡时期总任务的宣传后，脑子里时常出现一幅美丽的图画：“几年以后，办起了集体农庄，……农庄里修建起更大更漂亮的温室，不仅用它来育苗，还让西红柿、黄瓜等蔬菜，十冬腊月在温室里开出美丽的花，结出累累的果；那时说不定自己也会变成一个农学家。”正是在这一理想的推动下，“他曾经跑几十里路，到青岛郊区去学习修理果树的方法”；并且买了“北京蔬菜品种及其栽培方法”、“米丘林选集”等书，白天劳动，晚上学习，看不懂的地方，就跑上几里路，到专署农场去请教。
    农村大众报在发表了这一篇通讯后，五月十日、十九日还连续在这一栏内，表扬了担任农业生产合作社饲养员的高小毕业生、农业生产合作社的好会计等。农民报纸注意反映农民群众社会主义思想的成长，在农民群众中树立好的榜样，无疑将有助于教育和推动农民逐步实现农业的社会主义改造。　（郑文华）
