    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 13th (TASS dispatch): "Pravda" published a Geneva dispatch from Le Tarmalin entitled "Conspiracy of the Enemies of Peace in Indochina."

    Tarmalin wrote that now, despite all the efforts of the American delegation, the possibility of a successful outcome of the Geneva negotiations on restoring peace in Indochina is greater. At this time, the American rulers are plotting new conspiracies to obstruct the success of the conference. American journalists in Geneva are doing everything they can to spread all kinds of rumors, exaggerating the differences between the delegations and deliberately preventing readers from knowing that the delegations have reached a certain degree of agreement on many issues, in an attempt to confuse public opinion and poison the atmosphere in Geneva. There is ample evidence that American newspapers, acting on the orders of certain American political leaders, are trying to create the impression that the Geneva Conference is "doomed" and "a dead end."

    Many American journalists do not hesitate to openly distort the facts to make their reports—or rather, false reports—seem somewhat true. One example of this clumsy "work" by the American newspapers is an Associated Press dispatch published in the "New York Herald Tribune" on Saturday. In order to try to prove their so-called dead-end argument, the author of this report wrote that the representative of the People's Republic of China insisted at the meeting of the nine delegations on July 9th that Laos and Cambodia be prohibited from importing weapons necessary for defense.

    Tarmalin wrote that this is a shameless attempt to deceive public opinion, and to prevent it from correctly understanding the true position of the Chinese delegation.

    It is well known that the Chinese delegation has pointed out in its proposal that it is absolutely necessary to prohibit the entry of new land, sea, and air forces and military personnel, as well as all kinds of weapons and ammunition, into Laos and Cambodia after the cessation of hostilities. This proposal is based on the reasonable and irrefutable premise that any action to gather foreign weapons and military personnel in the Indochinese countries after the cessation of hostilities carries the risk of resuming hostilities.

    At the same time—and the Associated Press is certainly well aware of this—the delegation of the People's Republic of China agreed that a certain amount of weapons and ammunition could be imported into Laos and Cambodia for self-defense purposes, and suggested that the quantity and types of these weapons be considered at a separate meeting.

    The Chinese delegation also pointed out that there should be no foreign military bases on the territory of the three Indochinese countries after the cessation of hostilities, because the establishment of such bases is not consistent with the principle of limiting the import of weapons to those used for self-defense only.

    Tarmalin pointed out that this is the position of the delegation of the People's Republic of China. Everyone can clearly see that this position has nothing in common with the position of the Chinese delegation as stated in the message of the American news agency.

    The actions of the manufacturers of these messages, who deliberately distort the process of the Geneva Conference discussions, are directed by the most aggressive groups in the United States. The American aggressor groups are trying to accomplish two tasks: first, to obstruct the reaching of a mutually acceptable agreement on the issue of restoring peace in Indochina; and second, to place the responsibility for their hoped-for disruption of the negotiations on the delegations of peace-loving democratic countries.

    印度支那和平的敌人的阴谋
    ——苏联“真理报”登载的塔马林日内瓦来信的摘要
    【新华社十四日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十三日讯：“真理报”登载了勒·塔马林的一封日内瓦来信，题目是“印度支那和平的敌人的阴谋。”
    塔马林写道，现在，尽管美国代表团想尽办法，关于恢复印度支那和平的日内瓦谈判取得胜利结果的可能性却更大了，在这个时候，美国统治者又在策划新的阴谋来阻挠会议成功。在日内瓦的美国记者极尽散布各种谣言之能事，大肆渲染代表团之间的分歧，并且故意不让读者知道代表团之间对许多问题的看法有了一定程度的接近这一事实，企图迷惑舆论并毒害日内瓦的气氛。有充分的迹象证明，依照某些美国政治领袖的命令行事的美国报纸企图造成一种印象：好像日内瓦会议是“命运已定”，“此路不通”了。
    许多美国记者不惜公开歪曲事实来使他们的报道——或者不如说是假报道——看来有些像是真实的。美国报纸的这种笨拙的“工作”的例子之一是
  “纽约先驱论坛报”星期六登载的一则美联社消息。为了要设法证明他们所谓的此路不通的论点，这篇报道的作者写道，中华人民共和国代表在七月九日的九国代表团会议上坚持禁止老挝和柬埔寨运入防务所必需的武器。
    塔马林写道，这是一种哄骗舆论的无耻企图，想使舆论对中国代表团的真正立场不能正确了解。
    大家清楚知道，中国代表团已在它的建议中指出，在敌对行动停止后，禁止把新的陆、海、空军部队和军事人员以及各种武器和弹药运入老挝和柬埔寨，是十分必要的。这个建议是以这样一个合理和无可辩驳的前提为依据，即敌对行动停止后在印度支那国家聚集外国武器和军事人员的任何行动有使敌对行动恢复的危险。
    同时——美联社当然也清楚地知道这一点——中华人民共和国代表团同意一定数量的武器和弹药可以运入老挝和柬埔寨作为自卫之用，并建议在单独的会议上考虑这些武器的数量和种类。
    中国代表团还指出，在敌对行动停止后，在印度支那三国的领土上不应有任何外国的军事基地。因为这种基地的建立是和将武器的运入限于仅作为自卫之用的原则是不相符合的。
    塔马林指出，这就是中华人民共和国代表团的立场。所有的人都清楚看到这种立场和美国通讯社在它的消息中所说的中国代表团的立场毫无共同之处。
    这些消息的制造者蓄意歪曲日内瓦会议讨论的进程的行径，是美国最热中侵略的集团指使的。美国侵略集团正在力图完成两个任务：第一，阻挠在恢复印度支那和平问题上达成双方可以接受的协议；第二，将他们所希望的破坏谈判的责任推在爱好和平的各民主国家代表团的身上。
