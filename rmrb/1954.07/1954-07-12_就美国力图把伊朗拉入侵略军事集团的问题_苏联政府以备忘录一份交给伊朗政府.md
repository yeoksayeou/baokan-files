Xinhua News Agency, Tehran, July 9th: TASS reports: It has been learned here that on July 8th, the Soviet Ambassador to Iran, Anatoly I. Lavrentiev, visited the Iranian Foreign Minister A. Ardalan and, on the instructions of the Soviet government, handed him a memorandum. The memorandum reads as follows:

    "Recently, several Iranian and foreign newspapers have published news about the US government and the governments of certain other countries trying to pull Iran into an aggressive military bloc. This aggressive military bloc is being established in the Near East and Middle East on the basis of the Turkish-Pakistani military alliance concluded in April this year.

    The Soviet government particularly notes the news regarding the recent negotiations between the US Ambassador to Iran, Henderson, and the Iranian Prime Minister Zahedi, in which the Iranian side is said to have assured that Iran will participate in the military measures taken by the United States in the Near East and Middle East.

    Regarding this issue, the Soviet government requests the Iranian government to pay attention to the obligations undertaken by Iran in the Soviet-Iranian Guarantee and Neutrality Treaty concluded on October 1, 1927. According to this treaty, 'Each of the contracting parties undertakes to refrain, de facto or de jure, from participating in political alliances or agreements directed against the security on land and sea or the inviolability of the territories, independence and sovereignty of the other contracting party.' (Article 3 of the Treaty)

    In view of the existence of these obligations, the Soviet government requests the Iranian government to provide appropriate clarification on the substance of the aforementioned issues."

    Iranian Foreign Minister Ardalan promised to forward the memorandum to the Iranian government for consideration.

    就美国力图把伊朗拉入侵略军事集团的问题
    苏联政府以备忘录一份交给伊朗政府
    【新华社十日讯】塔斯社德黑兰九日讯：这里获悉，苏联驻伊朗大使阿纳托利·伊·拉夫连捷夫在八日访问伊朗外交大臣阿·安迪让，并奉苏联政府训令，交给他一份备忘录。备忘录内容如下：
    “最近若干伊朗报纸和外国报纸刊载了关于美国政府和某些其他国家政府力图把伊朗拉入侵略军事集团的消息。这个侵略军事集团正在今年四月缔结的土耳其和巴基斯坦军事联盟的基础上，在近东和中东建立中。
    苏联政府特别注意到关于最近美国驻伊朗大使汉德逊和伊朗首相萨希迪之间的谈判的消息，据说在谈判过程中，伊朗方面已保证，伊朗将参加美国在近东和中东采取的军事措施。
    关于这个问题，苏联政府要求伊朗政府注意伊朗在一九二七年十月一日缔结的苏伊保证和中立条约中所承担的义务。根据这个条约，‘缔约的每方保证不在实际上或形式上参加旨在威胁缔约对方的陆、海安全以及旨在侵犯其领土完整、独立或主权的政治联盟或协定。’（条约第三款）
    鉴于这些义务的存在，苏联政府要求伊朗政府就上述问题的实质作适当的澄清。”
    伊朗外交大臣安迪让答应把这份备忘录转交伊朗政府考虑。
