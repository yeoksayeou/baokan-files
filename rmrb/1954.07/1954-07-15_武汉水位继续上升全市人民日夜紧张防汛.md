Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, July 14th: The Yangtze River water level at Wuhan Customs exceeded 28 meters at 2:00 PM on July 12th, and continued to rise to 28.14 meters at 1:00 PM on July 13th, only 14 centimeters away from the highest water level in history. Leading figures from the Wuhan Municipal Party and government organs, as well as the Flood Prevention Headquarters, have personally gone to the dikes to strengthen leadership in flood prevention work. Deputy Commanders of the Headquarters, Yan Jun, Zhang Xuetao, Tang Shiyu, and others are personally directing operations at important dikes. Prior to this, the majority of dike heightening and reinforcement projects in the city had been completed ahead of schedule. Once danger was detected in the dikes, consolidation measures were immediately taken.

In recent days, many "Youth Flood Prevention Shock Brigades" composed of Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, and active young people from various organs, organizations, enterprises, and schools in the Central-South Region, Hubei Province, and Wuhan City have gone to the dikes to actively participate in dike repair, emergency rescue, or patrol and guard duties. On the night of the 12th and the morning of the 13th alone, more than 1,000 youth shock brigade members from the Central-South Region directly subordinate organs went to the dikes. Workers and citizens are also actively participating in and supporting flood prevention work. At night, the lights are bright along the entire dike line in the city, and the continuous stream of patrol and rescue teams is closely monitoring the flood with a fighting posture, striving to protect the safety of the urban area and ultimately overcome the flood.

    武汉水位继续上升全市人民日夜紧张防汛
    【新华社武汉十四日电】武汉关的长江水位十二日下午二时突破了二十八公尺，十三日下午一时继续上升到二十八点一四公尺；距离历年最高水位只差十四公分了。武汉市党、政机关和防汛总指挥部的负责人，大都已亲自上堤，加强防汛工作的领导。指挥部副总指挥阎钧、张雪涛、唐适宇等已分别在重要堤防亲自指挥。在此以前，全市堤防加高加固工程，大部已提前完工。堤防险情一经发现，立即采取了巩固措施。
    这几天，中南区、湖北省和武汉市各机关、团体、企业、学校中许多由共产党员、青年团员和青年群众积极分子组成的“青年防汛突击队”都已经上了堤，积极参加修堤、抢险或担任巡逻警戒任务。仅中南区直属机关在十二日晚到十三日早晨上堤的青年突击队员就有一千多人。工人、市民也都积极参加和支援防汛工作。夜间，全市堤防线上的电灯通明，川流不息的巡逻队、抢险队以战斗的姿态严密监视着洪水，为保卫市区安全、最后战胜洪水而斗争。
