    苏联农业展览会开幕前夕
    定于八月一日在莫斯科开幕的苏联农业展览会的筹备工作，已接近完成。在占地两百多公顷的展览会会场内，已建立起了三百多座展览馆、大厦和其他建筑物。这些宏伟漂亮的建筑物，和宽阔的广场、美丽的花园、花圃与喷泉，把展览会点缀成了一个崭新的花园般的城市。在很远的地方就可以看见展览会馆址的高耸入云的尖塔在夏天的阳光里闪耀着金光。
    现在评选展览会的参加者和征集展览品的工作也快要结束了。截至七月十三日止，已有十三万五千多个单位和个人获得了参加展览的资格。
    展览会已收到的展览品，有各种农作物样品与种子，有从格鲁吉亚运来的精美的柠檬、阿尔泰边疆区来的梅花鹿、塔吉克来的丝绸以及其他各地运来的各种各样优良的农产品与畜产品。（附图片）
