The Council of the China Political Science and Law Society held its fifth meeting of the first council on June 29th. Those present at the meeting included Council Chairman Dong Biwu, Vice-Chairmen Shen Junru, Xie Juezai, Zhang Zhiran, Qian Duansheng, and council members Shi Liang, Zhu Qiwen, Zhou Gengsheng, Mei Ru'ao, Xu Deheng, Pan Zhenya, and 28 others.

The meeting first heard a report from Zhu Qiwen, head of the Chinese delegation to the meeting of the Council of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers. The report stated that the meeting of the Council of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers, held in Leipzig, Germany from June 5th to 7th, discussed three topics: the issue of national sovereignty and international security, the issue of "McCarthyism," and the issue of testing weapons of mass destruction. The Chinese delegation delivered a speech on the issue of national sovereignty and international security, which was warmly welcomed and endorsed by the delegates attending the conference. The meeting passed three resolutions on the above-mentioned issues, calling on democratic legal workers and people of all countries around the world to strive to defend national sovereignty to ensure national security, to oppose fascist McCarthyism, and to demand a ban on the use of weapons of mass destruction. The meeting also sent a telegram expressing support for the innocent victims of the Matsukawa Incident in Japan.

After hearing the above report, the meeting proceeded to discuss the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China. After a speech by Chairman Dong Biwu, Shen Junru spoke first, saying: Since the late Qing Dynasty, the Chinese people have continuously struggled against the reactionary ruling class, demanding a people's constitution. However, from Emperor Guangxu to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, the "constitutions" they enacted were all deceptive tricks of hanging a sheep's head and selling dog meat. For the past 50 or 60 years, one of my long-cherished dreams has been to see the Chinese people formulate a constitution themselves, a constitution in which the people are the masters of their own affairs. Today, I have finally witnessed the promulgation of this draft constitution, and I have also been honored to participate in the drafting of this draft constitution under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao. He also said: Now that the people of our country have their own fundamental law, many new and important topics have been put forward to us legal scholars, requiring us to make a hundredfold effort under the guidance of Marxist-Leninist theory to study and elaborate the principles and principles of our people's constitution, and to theoretically summarize our country's rich experience in establishing and improving the people's democratic legal system, so as to provide beneficial contributions to our country's future legislative work, judicial work, and political and legal teaching and research work. He concluded by saying: In accordance with the spirit of the draft constitution, it is very necessary to expound the superiority of our people's democratic system to the peace-loving and democratic people and international friends engaged in legal work around the world, and to expound the firm will of our people to steadfastly "strive for the lofty goal of world peace and human progress" in international affairs. Subsequently, Zhang Zhiran, Shi Liang and others spoke at the meeting, unanimously expressing their support for the draft constitution.

The meeting finally passed a resolution endorsing the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China. The resolution calls on all members and political and legal workers across the country to earnestly and deeply study the draft constitution, actively participate in discussions, and widely publicize it to the masses; and through this study, discussion, and publicity, to improve the ideological level and working ability of political and legal workers, so as to strengthen the people's democratic legal system and ensure the victorious progress of socialist construction.

    中国政治法律学会理事会举行会议
    听取了我国出席国际民主法律工作者协会理事会会议代表团的报告，通过了拥护宪法草案的决议
    中国政治法律学会理事会在六月二十九日举行第一届理事会第五次会议。出席会议的有理事会主席董必武、副主席沈钧儒、谢觉哉、张志让、钱端升，理事史良、朱其文、周鲠生、梅汝璈、许德珩、潘震亚等二十八人。
    会议首先听取了我国出席国际民主法律工作者协会理事会会议代表团朱其文的报告。报告说，从六月五日到七日在德国来比锡举行的国际民主法律工作者协会理事会会议，讨论了关于国家主权与国际安全问题、“麦卡锡主义”问题、大规模毁灭性武器的试验问题等三个议题；我国代表团就国家主权与国际安全的问题作了发言，受到出席大会的代表们的热烈欢迎和赞同；这次会议通过了关于上述问题的三个决议，号召世界民主法律工作者和各国人民，努力保卫国家主权以确保国家安全；反对法西斯的麦卡锡主义；要求禁止使用大规模毁灭性的武器。这次会议还致电声援日本松川事件的无辜受害者。
    会议在听取了上述报告后，接着对中华人民共和国宪法草案进行了讨论。在主席董必武讲话之后，沈钧儒首先发言，他说：从满清末年起，中国人民就曾经不断地向反动统治阶级进行斗争，要有一个人民的宪法；但是，从光绪皇帝到蒋介石匪帮，他们所立出来的“宪法”都是挂羊头卖狗肉的骗人把戏。五六十年来，我梦寐以求的大愿望之一，就是能够看到中国人民自己制定出来一部由人民自己当家作主的宪法。在今天，我终于亲眼看到了这个宪法草案的公布，并且还曾经荣幸地在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，参加了这个宪法草案的起草工作。他又说：我国人民有了自己国家的根本大法之后，在我们从事法律科学研究的学术工作者面前，提出了很多新的重大课题，需要我们在马克思列宁主义理论的指导下，百倍地努力来研究和阐扬我们人民宪法的原理和原则，从理论上总结我国在建立和健全人民民主法制方面的丰富经验，以便对于我国今后日益发展的立法工作、司法工作和政法教学研究工作，提供有益的贡献。他最后说：根据宪法草案的精神，向全世界爱好和平民主的人民和从事法律工作的国际朋友们，阐扬我国人民民主制度的优越性，阐扬我国人民在国际事务中坚定不移地“为世界和平和人类进步的崇高目的而努力”的坚强意志，是十分必要的。接着，张志让、史良等都在会上发言，对宪法草案一致表示拥护。
    会议最后通过了拥护中华人民共和国宪法草案的决议。决议号召全体会员和全国政法工作者认真和深入地研究宪法草案，积极参加讨论，向群众广泛宣传；并通过这次研究、讨论和宣传，来提高政法工作者的思想水平和工作能力，以加强人民民主法制，保障社会主义建设事业的胜利进行。
