Anhui Province Overfulfills Annual Rapeseed Procurement Plan

    The broad masses of peasants in Anhui Province, a key rapeseed producing area, are enthusiastically selling their rapeseed to the state. By the end of June, the province had overfulfilled its annual rapeseed procurement plan by 6 percent.

    Before and after the rapeseed went on the market, many counties in the province established rapeseed procurement offices to uniformly lead the rapeseed procurement work. Supply and marketing cooperatives throughout the province established more than 1,500 rapeseed procurement points, with three or four procurement points in each district of Feixi County. The cooperative federations in Tongcheng and other counties also transferred cadres from grassroots cooperatives to study grading, inspection and other techniques.

    Due to the attention paid to rapeseed procurement by relevant departments and the great enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants to support national industrial construction, the rapeseed procurement work in the province progressed rapidly. In early May, the daily amount of rapeseed entering the market throughout the province was about 3 million jin, which rose to more than 8 million jin by early June. The daily amount of rapeseed entering the market in the Wuhu area reached a peak of more than 3 million jin.

    安徽省超额完成全年菜籽收购计划
    菜籽重点产区安徽省的广大农民踊跃地把菜籽卖给国家。到六月底止，该省已超额百分之六完成了全年收购菜籽的计划。
    菜籽上市前后，该省许多县成立了菜籽收购办公室，统一领导菜籽收购工作。全省供销合作社设立了一千五百多个菜籽收购点，肥西县每个区都有三、四个收购点。桐城等县的合作社联合社还抽调基层合作社的干部学习了评级、验货等技术。
    由于有关部门重视菜籽收购工作和广大农民支持国家工业建设的热情很高，该省收购菜籽工作进展很快。五月初，全省每天的菜籽上市量为三百万斤左右，到六月上旬，即上升到八百万斤以上。芜湖专区每日菜籽上市量最高曾达三百万斤以上。
