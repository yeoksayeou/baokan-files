    Party Supervision in Soviet Production Enterprises
    By our correspondent, Li He
    Editor's Note: This article systematically introduces the principles of the one-chief responsibility system and the strengthening of Party supervision over enterprises in the Soviet Union in the first part. The second part, through an interview with the Party Committee Secretary of the Dynamo Factory, specifically describes how Party organizations in Soviet production enterprises supervise the enterprise. Currently, many state-owned and locally state-owned enterprises are beginning to implement the one-chief responsibility system. Many leading cadres of factories and mines still lack experience in the Party's supervisory role after the implementation of the one-chief responsibility system and how to supervise enterprises. This article is useful for solving these problems.
    (I) One-Chief Responsibility System and Party Supervision
    Soviet production enterprises implement the one-chief responsibility system. In every period of economic construction, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has maintained the one-chief responsibility system and continuously struggled against phenomena that distorted this principle. On the one hand, the Party opposed the so-called "committee system" where no one was responsible; on the other hand, it opposed bureaucratic styles that neglected to give play to the enthusiasm of the masses and neglected to attract the masses to participate in management.
    As early as 1920, the resolution of the Ninth Congress of the Russian Communist Party pointed out that the one-chief responsibility system must replace the "committee system" in industrial management. In September 1929, when socialist industrialization achieved great success, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union made a special resolution on adjusting production management and establishing a one-chief responsibility system. This resolution criticized the shortcomings that existed in production management at that time, namely: on the one hand, there were still phenomena of Party organizations and trade union organizations interfering in production management; on the other hand, there were also administrative responsible cadres bureaucratically neglecting the correct decisions of Party organizations and trade union organizations. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union instructed the principles of division of labor and cooperation among the administrative, Party, and trade union organizations in enterprises in this resolution. The resolution pointed out: "The administration (factory director) is directly responsible for completing the production and financial plan and all production tasks. The administration leads the enterprise management organization and all organizational and technical production processes. All his operational and business orders must be unconditionally executed by lower-level administrations and workers, regardless of their position in the Party organization, trade union organization, or other organizations. The enterprise administration directly appoints all administrative and technical personnel... When appointing or removing a staff member, the administration must consider the opinions of the Party organization and the trade union organization; in cases where the Party organization and the trade union organization disagree with the appointment or removal, they still have the right to appeal to the higher-level Party, trade union, and business organs, but this does not prevent the implementation of the administrative decision. The enterprise and workshop administration, while implementing all necessary measures to strengthen and implement production discipline in the enterprise, should be good at combining all its organizational and administrative working methods with the need to give play to the initiative of the working masses, with attracting them to manage production, with the need to consider their suggestions and implement the adopted suggestions, to encourage rationalization initiatives and workers' inventions as much as possible, and to treat the needs of workers and their opinions on technical and management shortcomings with the utmost care." (Russian Soviet Communist Party Resolution Compilation Sixth Edition Volume 2, page 801). By 1941, the resolution made by the Eighteenth Party Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union based on Comrade Malenkov's report also emphasized: it is necessary to "resolutely strengthen the one-chief responsibility system in enterprises and make the factory director a de facto fully empowered leader, fully responsible for the enterprise's situation and production order." (Russian Soviet Communist Party Resolution Compilation Seventh Edition Volume 2, page 976).
    In a society where the means of production are publicly owned, the class interests of the enterprise leaders appointed by the state and the masses of workers being led are consistent. Therefore, the strong centralized leadership in Soviet enterprises does not exclude giving play to the enthusiasm of the working masses and attracting them to participate in management. Therefore, the one-chief responsibility system in Soviet enterprises has a profound democratic nature. The Party Constitution of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union stipulates that the primary Party organizations in production enterprises are granted the right to supervise the administrative work of the enterprise, which is a reflection of this democratic nature.
    The Party Constitution revised by the 18th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (1939) stipulated: "In order to enhance the role of primary Party organizations in production enterprises (including state farms, collective farms, and machine tractor stations) and their responsibility for the work of the enterprise, these organizations are given the right to supervise the administrative work of the enterprise." The Party Constitution revised by the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (1952) expanded this supervisory right to the primary Party organizations of trade enterprises.
    When the Soviet Union began to implement this kind of Party supervision, individual enterprise leaders did not understand that Party supervision would only strengthen the one-chief responsibility system, and mistakenly thought that it was weakening the one-chief responsibility system. Comrade Zhdanov explained this problem in his report to the 18th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, saying: "During the discussion, there were voices saying that giving primary Party organizations in production the right of supervision would strike a blow to the unitary responsibility system. I think: those who think that the unitary responsibility system is managing the factory without relying on activists do not understand the unitary responsibility system at all. Our Soviet Bolshevik unitary responsibility system lies in: being good at managing, being good at organizing business, selecting cadres, issuing correct instructions, requiring work reports, eliminating irresponsibility and lack of specialized responsibility. But it also means: being good at relying on Party organizations, relying on activists in enterprises, and relying on all personnel in enterprises in this work." (Zhdanov: "Revision of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) Constitution," People's Publishing House edition, page 73)
    Simultaneously implementing the one-chief responsibility system and strengthening Party supervision is the basic method to ensure the completion of the tasks assigned to enterprises by the Party and the government. This is the experience accumulated by Soviet enterprises over a long period of time.
    The experience of Soviet production enterprises proves that: to successfully complete the state's production plan, enterprise administrations must attach importance to the supervision of Party organizations, that is to say, they must be good at relying on all employees through primary Party organizations; and primary Party organizations must conduct correct supervision of administrative work, that is to say, they must support administrative orders and measures with political and organizational work among the masses, do their best to help administrations solve problems in production, strengthen the one-chief responsibility system, and unite all employees to work together to complete the production plan. Therefore, the supervision of administrative work by the primary Party organizations of enterprises has one of the biggest characteristics - a social nature. That is to say, this kind of supervision is neither an administrative inspection like the superior to the subordinate, nor does it rely solely on the Party committee secretary alone or a few members of the Party committee. This kind of supervision is to work on all Party and non-Party employees in the enterprise, improve their level of communist consciousness, listen to their opinions, rely on their strength, and provide useful methods for the administrative side to unleash the enterprise's production potential.
    In Soviet production enterprises, primary Party organizations do not overstep their boundaries to replace or share administrative leadership work, but administrative responsible cadres should often consult with Party organizations when dealing with major issues. Because Party organizations maintain the closest ties with the masses of employees, they are best able to help administrations solve difficulties and discover and overcome shortcomings. The factory director is responsible for the overall business of the factory, especially production and technology, the Party organization conducts social and political work, and the trade union organization organizes production competitions and cares about the material and cultural welfare of workers under the leadership of the Party organization. Therefore, there is no question of who is subordinate to whom between the Party organization and the administration, but rather a clear division of labor, close cooperation, and joint guarantee of the completion of production tasks.
    (II) Interview with the Party Committee Secretary of the Dynamo Factory
    In order to understand the actual situation of the supervision of administrative work by primary Party organizations in Soviet production enterprises, I visited Alexander Alexandrovich Osmarkov, the Party Committee Secretary of the Moscow Dynamo Factory.
    The Dynamo Factory is famous for producing generators. Its products are not only supplied to all parts of the Soviet Union, but also to our country and various people's democratic countries. This factory has a history of about 55 years. In the early days of the establishment of the Soviet regime, Lenin and Stalin visited here successively. Fifty-one years ago, the first Party branch was established in this factory. This is something that Party workers should be proud of. Osmarkov said with a smile:
  "Comrade Nikolaev, the organizer of the Party branch at that time, is still alive, in his eighties, receiving a pension. He maintains contact with the factory. We often invite him to participate in the factory's evening parties. He is also very willing to come."
    Comrade Osmarkov himself is very young. This successor to Nikolaev is only thirty-two years old. He joined the Patriotic War a few months after graduating from a secondary technical school. After the war, he came to the factory and served as a technician, section foreman, workshop foreman, and then as chief technician, design office director, and workshop director, while studying at the college. In 1953, he graduated from the college and took on the important position of Party Committee Secretary of the factory.
    The young and humble Party Committee Secretary first introduced the composition of the factory's Party Committee, and then tried his best to answer the questions I raised.
    The Dynamo Factory's Party Committee leads 32 branches. The Party Committee consists of eleven members. The Party Committee Secretary and two Deputy Secretaries are separated from production; the Secretary is responsible for the overall work, one of the Deputy Secretaries is responsible for organizational work, and the other is responsible for propaganda work. The other eight members are not separated from production; they are the Factory Director, the Chairman of the Factory Trade Union Committee, the Secretary of the Communist Youth League Committee, a worker, two foremen, and two engineers. From here, it can be seen that the Party Committee not only includes the leading figures of the factory, but also ordinary workers and foremen. Comrade Osmarkov explained the reason for doing so, saying: "This can discuss issues more completely and solve them from several aspects."
    The administrative, Party, and trade union organizations of the factory have a clear division of labor. Ensuring the completion of the production plan is everyone's common goal, but each has different aspects of effort. The factory director is responsible for the completion of the plan by the workshop directors. If he sees any shortcomings in labor discipline, material supply, etc., he instructs them to correct them. That is to say, the administration ensures the completion of the plan from the production and technical aspects. The Party organization carries out mass work, so that all employees understand the production tasks they are undertaking, mobilize them to complete it, and require Party members to take the lead. For example: the workshop Party organization pays attention to ensuring that all workers in the section understand the daily tasks. If an individual Party member worker in a certain section does not complete the task for the day, the Party group studies the reasons for not completing it and the ways to correct it. Because the production of the Dynamo Factory is a flow operation, all operations are connected to each other, and whether each worker completes the plan every day is related to the completion of the overall plan of the factory. If an individual non-Party worker does not complete the task for the day, then the trade union group studies ways to help him. The main method to ensure the completion of the production plan is to carry out socialist labor competitions. The Party organization leads the competition through the trade union organization. In the workshop, after the workshop director assigns tasks to each section at the beginning of the month, the trade union organization organizes workers to compete, regularly checks and summarizes the competition, and promotes advanced experience, while the Party organization supports the competition with ideological education and propaganda work.
    Personnel and cadres are of decisive significance for work. The factory director has the right to transfer any staff member within the factory. However, like factory directors of other factories in the Soviet Union, the factory director of the Dynamo Factory always consults with the Party Committee Secretary and the Factory Trade Union Chairman before transferring staff. The factory director always issues the order after obtaining the consent of the Party Committee Secretary. This kind of consultation is not restricted to any form, usually the factory director orally consults with the Party Committee Secretary for opinions. Because everything starts from the interests of the work, there have been no differences between the factory headquarters and the Party Committee in handling cadre issues, although in principle, if there are differences, an application can be made to the Party District Committee for resolution.
    The factory Party organization regularly supervises the work of the administration. This does not mean that every work of the factory director must be supervised. For large factories like the Dynamo Factory, their factory directors are approved by the Central Committee of the Party, and they have rich experience in leading production. Mikhailov, the former Secretary of the Moscow State Committee of the Soviet Communist Party, Kabanov, the current Minister of Foreign Trade of the Soviet Union, and Skidlianko, the Minister of the Electric Machine Industry, have all served as factory directors of the Dynamo Factory. The Party organization has the responsibility to strengthen the one-chief responsibility system and support the orders of the factory director in supervising administrative work. The factory director of the Dynamo Factory once ordered the adoption of flow operation methods to produce resistors. This order was not executed. The Party organization of the workshop producing resistors submitted the issue of adopting flow operation methods to the workshop Party member assembly for discussion. The meeting criticized those who thought that the conditions were not enough and opposed the flow operation methods, and passed a resolution to adopt the flow operation method. The workshop director specified the deadline for completing the preparation work. As a result, the flow operation method was adopted, the output increased a lot, the factory director's order was executed, and the workers became more convinced of the benefits of this method.
    The factory Party Committee regularly listens to and discusses the factory director's reports on production situations and problems. This is only one way of Party supervision. Party supervision cannot be limited to this. The role of Party supervision limited to a few people in the Party Committee itself is not significant. If the Party organization deeply understands the factory's business and the situation of the employees, mobilizes all employees to participate in supervision, and taps the potential production capacity, then the Party organization can have a decisive impact on the major issues of the factory. Only in this way can Party supervision play its due role.
    During a period last year, the Dynamo Factory's production was uneven. The first ten days of each month were low, the second ten days were high, and the third ten days were low again. Some people said that this was because there were no conditions for balanced production. The factory Party Committee decided to study this situation. A committee chaired by the factory's chief engineer was organized. This committee investigated and studied the situation and provided preliminary suggestions to the factory's employee assembly. At the assembly, the workers also exposed the existing shortcomings and added useful opinions to the committee's suggestions. According to the committee's suggestions and the workers' opinions, methods to ensure balanced production were determined and implemented after being approved by the factory director. Three months later, the production was balanced, and those who previously said that there were no conditions for balanced production also corrected their views.
    This factory once received the task of drastically increasing the production of daily necessities such as electric furnaces in 1954. The factory Party Committee was concerned about the completion of this new task put forward by the Party and the government. Similarly, a committee was organized. The committee studied and prepared basic materials and opinions, including workers' suggestions. The Party Committee discussed the committee's materials. Some people thought that there was still time and there was no need to prepare too early. The Party Committee pointed out that it was necessary to prepare immediately and also mobilize the masses. The Party Committee made a decision. Now the factory is completing the production plan for daily necessities. If the Party Committee had not seen this problem clearly at that time, it might have required more expenses and manpower later due to the urgency of time.
    In addition to answering questions about Party supervision, Comrade Osmarkov promised my request and briefly described his day's work.
    The Party Committee Secretary has a predetermined procedure for his daily work. He goes to the factory at nine or ten o'clock every day, and eats lunch at two or three o'clock, sometimes changing. He participates in the meetings of the secretaries of the factory's branches every Monday, and puts forward this week's tasks to the branch secretaries. These tasks are discussed and settled with the two deputy secretaries at half past nine on Saturday morning of the previous week. His meeting with the two deputy secretaries only takes three or four minutes. He attends the factory Party Committee meeting at five o'clock every Wednesday afternoon. The meeting lasts about three hours, discussing and deciding on issues of the nature of the entire factory, and also listening to reports from the workshop branch secretaries. He tries to find time every month to participate in the Party member assemblies of two or three workshops, listens to the opinions of the masses, understands the real situation, so as to compare, summarize, and learn.
    Every day at eleven o'clock in the morning, if there are no exceptions, Comrade Osmarkov inspects the workshops and talks with the secretaries of the branches. Once, a workshop was preparing to adopt flow operation methods. He went to this workshop and told the branch secretary to discuss this issue at the Party member assembly, that is, to instruct him to make the employees support the flow operation methods and make the Party members become pioneers. He walked from one workshop to another. If he found that a certain workshop was doing a good job, he would ask the branch secretary of another workshop to take a look. This prompted them to exchange experiences.
    However, his inspection sometimes has to be replaced by exceptional things. For example, someone from the collective farm that the Dynamo Factory is obliged to help comes. He needs to meet the people, listen to opinions, and answer questions. He meets three or five people every day. Every Party member or non-Party member can come to see him at any time. This interrupts his other work. But for the convenience of the masses, he does not stipulate a fixed time for meetings.
    It seems that maintaining close contact with Party activists and the masses is the key to the young Comrade Osmarkov being competent in his Party work in leading the large factory and effectively leading the Party organization to supervise administrative work. He said: "Obviously, the contact with the masses is not formal, but the closest cooperation. Comrades regard the Party Committee Secretary as their own advisor and old comrade."

    苏联生产企业中党的监督
    本报记者　李何
    编者按：这篇文章中，第一部分比较系统地介绍了苏联实行一长负责制和加强党对企业的监督的原则；第二部分通过对狄纳摩工厂党委书记的访问，具体地介绍了苏联生产企业中的党组织如何对企业进行监督。目前，很多国营和地方国营企业正在开始实行一长负责制。不少厂矿的领导干部对于实行一长负责制后党的监督作用以及如何对企业进行监督等问题，还很缺乏经验。这篇文章对于解决这些问题是有参考作用的。
    （一）一长负责制和党的监督
    苏联生产企业是实行一长负责制的。在经济建设各个时期，苏联共产党维护着一长负责制，与曲解这个原则的现象进行了不断的斗争。党一方面反对无人负责的所谓“委员制”，另一方面也反对忽视发挥群众积极性，忽视吸引群众参加管理的官僚主义作风。
    远在一九二○年，俄国共产党第九次代表大会的决议就指出了，在工业管理中必须以一长负责制代替“委员制”。在一九二九年九月，当社会主义工业化获得巨大成绩的时候，苏联共产党中央委员会作出了关于调整生产管理和建立一长负责制的办法的专门决议。这个决议批评了当时在生产管理中存在着的缺点，即：一方面还有党组织和工会组织干涉生产管理的现象；另一方面，也有行政负责干部官僚主义地忽视党组织和工会组织的正确决定的现象。苏联共产党中央在这个决议中指示了企业中行政、党组织和工会组织分工合作的原则。决议指出：“行政（厂长）直接负责完成生产财务计划和所有生产任务。行政领导着企业管理机构以及所有组织上和技术上的生产过程。所有他的作业和事务上的命令，对于下级行政，对于工人，都是要无条件执行的，不论他们在党组织、工会组织或其他组织中居于什么地位。企业的行政直接委任全部行政人员和技术人员……在任免某个工作人员时候，行政必须考虑党组织和工会组织的意见；党组织和工会组织在不同意任免的场合，仍有权向上级党的、工会的和业务的机关上诉，但不阻止行政决定的实施。企业的和车间的行政，在企业中实行一切加强与贯彻生产纪律的必要措施的同时，应当善于把自己全部组织的和行政的工作方法，与必须发挥工人群众的首创精神结合起来，与吸引他们管理生产结合起来，与必须考虑他们的建议和实现被采纳的建议、尽量鼓励合理化创举和工人的发明等等结合起来，与最关心地对待工人的需要和他们对技术上管理上的缺点的意见结合起来。”（俄文苏共决议汇集第六版第二卷八○一页）。到一九四一年，苏联共产党第十八次代表会议根据马林科夫同志报告所作的决议，还着重指出：必须“坚决地加强企业中的一长负责制并使厂长成为事实上全权领导者，对企业状况和生产秩序完全负责。”（俄文苏共决议汇集第七版第二卷九七六页）
    在生产资料公有的社会里，由国家委任的企业领导者和被领导的工人群众的阶级利益是一致的，所以苏联企业中坚强的集中的领导并不排斥发挥工人群众的积极性和吸引他们参加管理，所以苏联企业中一长负责制具有深刻的民主性质。苏联共产党党章规定，给予生产企业的基层党组织以监督企业行政工作的权利，就是这种民主性质的体现。
    苏联共产党第十八次代表大会（一九三九年）修改的党章规定：“为了提高生产企业（国营农场、集体农庄和机器拖拉机站在内）的基层党组织的作用和它们对企业工作状况的责任，给这些组织以监督企业的行政工作的权利。”苏共第十九次代表大会（一九五二年）修改的党章，把这种监督权利扩大给贸易企业的基层党组织。
    苏联开始实行这种党的监督的时候，个别企业领导者不了解党的监督只会加强一长负责制，而误认为这是削弱一长负责制。日丹诺夫同志在苏联共产党第十八次代表大会上的报告中解释过这个问题，他说：“在讨论时曾有这样的呼声，说给生产初级党组织以监督权，就是给单一责任制以打击。我以为：那些认为单一责任制是不依靠积极分子来管理工厂的人，是一点也不懂得单一责任制的。我们苏维埃的布尔什维克的单一责任制就在于：善于管理、善于组织业务、挑选干部、发出正确指令、要求工作报告、消除不负责任和没有专责的现象。但它同时也意味着：在这种工作中善于依靠党组织，依靠企业中的积极分子，依靠企业中的全体人员。”（日丹诺夫：“修改联共（布）党章”，人民出版社版七十三页）
    同时实行一长负责制和加强党的监督，这是保证完成党和政府交给企业的任务的基本方法，这是苏联企业长期积累起来的经验。
    苏联生产企业的经验证明：要顺利地完成国家的生产计划，企业行政必须重视党组织的监督，这就是说，必须善于通过基层党组织依靠全体职工群众；而基层党组织必须对行政工作进行正确的监督，这就是说，必须以在群众中的政治和组织工作来支持行政的命令和措施，尽力帮助行政解决生产中的问题，加强一长负责制，团结全体职工一致努力完成生产计划。因此，企业基层党组织对行政工作的监督，具有一个最大的特点——社会性质。也就是说，这种监督既不像上级对下级那种行政性质的检查，又不单依靠党委书记一个人或党委会几个人。这种监督就是要向企业中党和非党全体职工进行工作，提高他们的共产主义觉悟程度，听取他们的意见，依靠他们的力量，给行政方面提供有益的办法，以发挥企业的生产潜在力。
    在苏联生产企业中，基层党组织不越俎代庖地代替或分担行政领导工作，但行政负责干部在处理重大问题时应该经常和党组织商量。因为党组织和职工群众保持着最密切的联系，最能帮助行政解决困难和发现与克服缺点。厂长负责全厂业务特别是生产和技术，党组织进行社会政治工作，工会组织在党组织的领导下组织生产竞赛和关心工人物质和文化的福利。因此，党组织和行政之间，不存在谁从属谁的问题，而是明确地分工，紧密地合作，共同保证生产任务的完成。
    （二）访问狄纳摩工厂党委书记
    为了了解苏联生产企业中基层党组织对行政工作的监督的实际状况，我访问了莫斯科狄纳摩工厂党委书记亚历山大·亚历山得维奇·奥斯玛科夫。
    狄纳摩工厂以出产发电机闻名，它的产品不但供给苏联各地，而且供给我国和各人民民主国家。这个工厂已有五十五年左右的历史。在苏维埃政权建立初期，列宁和斯大林先后到过这里。五十一年前，这个工厂就建立了第一个党的支部。这是值得党的工作者引为自豪的。奥斯玛科夫笑哈哈地说：
  “当时的党支部组织者尼古莱耶夫同志还活着，八十多岁了，领着养老金。他保持着和工厂的联系。我们常请他参加工厂的晚会。他也很愿意来。”
    奥斯玛科夫同志自己却很年青。这位尼古莱耶夫的后继者不过三十二岁。他从中等技术学校毕业没有几个月就参加了卫国战争。战后他到了工厂，先后当了技师、工段工长、车间工长，以后又当了主任技师、设计室主任、车间主任，同时在学院学习。一九五三年他在学院毕业，就担任工厂党委书记这样重要的职务。
    年青而谦虚的党委书记首先介绍了工厂党委员会的组成，接着尽力解答我所提出的问题。
    狄纳摩工厂党委员会领导着三十二个支部。党委员会由十一个委员组成。党委书记和两个副书记是脱离生产的；书记负责全盘工作，副书记中一个负责组织工作，另一个负责宣传工作。其他八个委员是不脱离生产的；他们是厂长、工厂工会委员会主席、青年团委员会书记、一个工人、两个工长、两个工程师。从这里可以看到，党委员会不但包括工厂的领导人物，也包括普通的工人和工长。奥斯玛科夫同志解释这样做的道理说：“这样能够更圆满地讨论问题，并且从几个方面来解决它。”
    工厂的行政、党组织和工会组织是有明确分工的。保证完成生产计划，是大家的共同目标，但各有不同的努力方面。厂长责成各车间主任完成计划。如果他看到在劳动纪律、在材料的供应等等方面有什么缺点，他就指令改正。这就是说，行政从生产和技术方面保证计划的完成。党组织则进行群众工作，使全体职工都了解自己所负担的生产任务，动员他们去完成它，要求党员起带头作用。比方：车间党组织注意使全工段职工都了解每天的任务。如果某工段个别党员工人没有完成当天任务，党小组就研究没有完成的缘故和改正的办法。因为狄纳摩工厂的生产是流水作业的，所有操作彼此联系，每个工人每天是否完成计划，关系到全厂总计划的完成。如果个别非党工人没有完成当天任务，那么由工会小组研究办法去帮助他。保证生产计划完成的主要方法是进行社会主义劳动竞赛。党组织通过工会组织来领导竞赛。在车间中，当月初车间主任把任务分配给每个工段后，工会组织就组织工人进行竞赛，定期检查和总结竞赛，推广先进经验，而党组织以思想教育、宣传鼓动工作支持竞赛。
    人员、干部对于工作是有决定意义的。厂长有权调动厂内任何工作人员。但是，和苏联别的工厂厂长一样，狄纳摩工厂厂长在调动工作人员之前，总是先同党委书记和工厂工会主席商量，厂长总是在征求得党委书记的同意之后才签发命令。这种商量不拘什么形式，通常是厂长向党委书记口头征询一下意见。因为都是从工作的利益出发，狄纳摩工厂厂部和党委会之间在处理干部问题上实际上没有发生过任何分歧，虽然在原则上如果有分歧时可以申请党区委员会解决。
    工厂党组织对行政的工作经常进行监督。这并不是对厂长的每一项工作都要监督。像狄纳摩工厂这样的大工厂，它们的厂长是经过党中央委员会批准的，他们有领导生产的丰富经验。前任苏共莫斯科州委书记米海依洛夫、现任苏联对外贸易部部长卡巴诺夫、电力机器工业部部长斯基多连科，都当过狄纳摩工厂的厂长。党组织在监督行政工作中有责任加强一长负责制，支持厂长的命令。狄纳摩工厂厂长曾经命令采用流水作业方法出产电阻器。这个命令没有被执行。出产电阻器的车间党组织把采用流水作业方法问题提交车间党员大会讨论。会上批评了那些认为条件不够而反对流水作业方法的人们，通过了采用流水作业法的决议。车间主任指定完成准备工作的期限。结果流水作业方法被采用了，产量提高了很多，厂长的命令被执行了，工人们更相信这个方法的好处。
    工厂党委员会经常听取和讨论厂长关于生产情况和问题的报告。这只是党的监督的一种方式。党的监督不能以此为限。限于党委员会本身几个人参加的党的监督，作用是不大的。如果党组织深入和熟悉厂内业务和职工情况，发动全体职工群众参加监督，发掘生产潜在能力，那么党组织能够对工厂的重大问题发生决定性影响。只有这样，党的监督才会起应有的作用。
    狄纳摩工厂去年有一个时期生产不均衡。每月第一旬低、第二旬高、第三旬又低。有人说，这是因为没有均衡生产的条件。工厂党委员会决定研究这种情况。组织了以工厂总工程师为主席的委员会。这个委员会调查研究了情况，向全厂职工大会提供了初步建议。在大会上工人们也揭发了存在的缺点，对委员会的建议增添了有益的意见。根据委员会的建议和工人们的意见，定出了保证均衡生产的办法，经过厂长批准后施行。三个月后，生产均衡了，以前说没有均衡生产条件的人也改正了自己的观点。
    这个工厂曾经接到在一九五四年急剧增产像电炉等日用必需品的任务。工厂党委员会关切党和政府提出的这个新任务的完成。同样组织了委员会。委员会研究和准备了基本材料和意见，包括工人的建议在内。党委会讨论了委员会的材料。有些人认为时间还来得及，用不着太早准备。党委员会指出了需要立即准备好，还要发动群众。党委员会作出了决定。现在工厂正在完成日用品的生产计划。如果当时党委员会没有看清楚这个问题，后来可能因为时间仓促而需更多的费用和人力。
    除了解答党的监督问题以外，奥斯玛科夫同志答应我的要求，简短地叙述了自己的一天工作。
    这位党委书记每天工作都有预定的程序。他每天九点或十点上工厂，二点或三点吃午饭，有时也变动。他在每星期一要参加工厂各支部书记的会议，向支部书记们提出本周任务，这些任务是他在上一星期六上午九点半钟和两个副书记开会商量妥的。他和两个副书记的会议只占三四十分钟。他在每星期三下午五点钟参加工厂党委员会会议。会议约长三个钟头，讨论和决定全厂性质的问题，也听取车间支部书记的报告。他每月争取时间参加两三个车间的党员大会，倾听群众意见，了解真实情况，以便比较、总结和学习。
    每天上午十一点钟，如果没有例外事情，奥斯玛科夫同志就巡视各车间，和各支部书记谈话。有一次，一个车间准备采用流水作业方法。他到了这个车间，告诉支部书记要在党员大会上讨论这个问题，也就是指示他要使职工群众支持流水作业方法，并且使党员成为先锋。他从一个车间走到另一个车间。发现某一车间工作做得好，就请别的车间支部书记去看看。这样促使他们交流经验。
    但是，他的这种巡视有时不得不被例外事情所代替。例如狄纳摩工厂所义务帮助的集体农庄有人来了。他需要接见来人，倾听意见，回答问题。他每天要接见三、五个人。每个党员或非党员在任何时刻都可以来见他。这要打断他的其他工作。但是为了群众的方便，他并不规定接见的固定时刻。
    看起来，和党的积极分子以及群众保持密切的联系，这就是年青的奥斯玛科夫同志胜任他领导大工厂的党工作，有成效地领导党组织监督行政工作的关键。他说：“显然，和群众的联系不是形式的，而是最密切的合作。同志们是把党委书记看作自己的顾问和老同志的。”
