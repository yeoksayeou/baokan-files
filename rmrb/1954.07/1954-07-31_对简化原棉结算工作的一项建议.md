    A Suggestion for Simplifying Raw Cotton Settlement Work
    A letter from Chu Guang of the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation, East China District Company: I am engaged in raw cotton settlement work. Raw cotton has different actual moisture content and impurity content, and the actual weight needs to be converted according to the standard moisture and impurity content. According to current regulations, the moisture and impurity content must be calculated to two decimal places after the percentage (i.e., ten thousandths), and then divided by the standard moisture and impurity content (calculated as a percentage), resulting in six decimal places, which makes the calculation process very complicated. When raw cotton is allocated between cooperatives and state-owned companies, between state-owned companies, and between state-owned companies and yarn mills, this calculation and verification must be done during handover, which requires a lot of manpower. Therefore, I often pay attention to researching methods to improve work. Later, I discovered that if the actual moisture and impurity content is calculated to one decimal place after the percentage, the settlement procedures can be greatly simplified.
      Will simplifying the settlement procedures affect the accuracy of raw cotton settlement? I don't think it will. Because the difference in moisture and impurity content after omitting one decimal place is only a few ten-thousandths. Currently, the moisture content of raw cotton is tested by sampling, usually taking a sample from one out of ten bales of cotton, and only a small portion is taken from the sampled bale. The difference between the sampled and unsampled bales, and between the sampled and unsampled parts of the same bale, is more than a few ten-thousandths. There are electrical ovens and kerosene ovens for testing moisture content, and some even use visual inspection and hand touch to determine it. The difference between using electrical ovens and kerosene ovens, and between testing different cotton samples with the same oven, is also more than a few ten-thousandths, not to mention visual inspection and hand touch. The inspection of impurity content also includes manual inspection and machine inspection, and the situation is roughly the same as moisture inspection.
    It is understood that the moisture and impurity content of imported Soviet cotton is calculated to one decimal place after the percentage. The reason why we currently use the algorithm of two decimal places after the percentage is just following old habits! In order to simplify procedures and facilitate work, it is recommended that the Ministry of Textile Industry and other relevant units jointly study and change the complicated practices of raw cotton settlement in the past.
    Editor's Note: After receiving the letter from reader Chu Guang, we contacted the Ministry of Textile Industry, the Marketing Bureau of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives, and the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation. The above three units believe that Comrade Chu Guang's suggestion is beneficial to simplifying raw cotton settlement procedures and improving work efficiency. Because the change in this calculation method involves modifying the original fiber inspection regulations and affects the work of cotton institutions and yarn mills across the country, the Fiber Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Textile Industry is consulting with relevant departments to study specific implementation methods in order to avoid confusion in inspection, handover, pricing, and other aspects of various relevant units.

### 对简化原棉结算工作的一项建议

专栏：读者来信摘要

    对简化原棉结算工作的一项建议
    中国花纱布公司华东区公司褚光来信：我是担任原棉结算工作的。原棉实际含水率、含杂率不同，需要根据标准含水含杂率来换算实际重量。按目前规定，含水含杂率要算至百分率以后的小数两位（即万分之一），再被标准含水含杂率（以百分率计算）除，就有小数六位，计算手续十分繁复。合作社与国营公司间、国营公司相互之间和国营公司同纱厂间调配原棉，交接时都要这样计算和复核，所费人力很多。因此，我就经常注意研究改进工作的方法。后来发现，如果把实际含水含杂率算到百分率以后的一位小数为止，是可以使结算手续大大简化。
      简化了结算手续是否会影响原棉结算的准确性呢？我认为是不会的。因为少算一位小数后含水含杂率只相差万分之几。目前对原棉水分是抽样检验的，通常是十包棉花中扦样一包，被扦的一包中也只扦取很少一部分；在被扦棉包与未被扦棉包之间，在同一棉包的被扦部分与未被扦部分之间，差异何止万分之几。检验水分的方法，有用电气烘箱的，有用火油烘箱的，甚至还有用目测手摸来决定的；用电气烘箱和用火油烘箱之间，用同一烘箱烘验不同棉样之间，其差异也不止万分之几，而目测手摸的办法更不用说了。含杂率的检验也分手检与机器检两种，情况大致与水分检验相同。
    据了解：目前进口的苏联棉花的含水含杂率都是算到百分率以后一位小数的。我国目前所以采用百分率以后两位小数的算法，不过是因袭过去的旧习惯罢了！为了简化手续，以利工作，建议中央纺织工业部和其它有关单位共同研究，改变过去原棉结算的繁复作法。
    编者按：我们收到读者褚光的来信后，曾分别与中央纺织工业部、中华全国合作社联合总社推销局和中国花纱布公司进行联系。上述三个单位认为褚光同志的建议对简化原棉结算手续，提高工作效率是有好处的。因为这项计算方法的改变涉及修改原来的纤维检验规程，并对全国棉业机构和纱厂工作都有关系。为了避免各有关单位检验、交接、计价等各方面发生混乱，中央纺织工业部纤维检验局正与有关部门进行协商，研究具体实施办法。
