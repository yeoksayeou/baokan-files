Xinhua News Agency, Washington, June 30th (TASS): A joint declaration was issued after the talks between Eisenhower and Churchill. The declaration stated that the United States and the United Kingdom will "continue to work together in a spirit of close friendship, based on the principles of the Atlantic Charter, to seek world peace."

The declaration discussed the principles of the policies that the two governments are prepared to pursue in international affairs. These policies are essentially no different from those that the Anglo-American bloc has been pursuing until now.

For example, the declaration believes that "a universal and substantial reduction of world armaments of all kinds, under effective safeguards, would advance the cause of world peace," and it pledges "an unwavering determination to help create conditions in which the astonishing nuclear power now in human hands can be used for the benefit of mankind and not for its destruction." However, the declaration concludes by saying that the United States and the United Kingdom must "develop and maintain spiritual, economic, and military strength" to achieve the purposes listed in the declaration.

    美英会谈后发表联合宣言
    【新华社一日讯】塔斯社华盛顿六月三十日讯：艾森豪威尔和邱吉尔会谈结束后发表了一项联合宣言。宣言中说，美国和英国将“本着亲密友爱的精神继续共同努力，在大西洋宪章原则的基础上，谋求世界和平”。
    宣言中谈到了两国政府准备在国际事务中奉行的政策的原则。这种政策实质上和英美集团至今一直在奉行的政策毫无差别。
    例如，宣言中认为，“在有效的保障下，普遍地大大裁减世界各种类别的军备就会推进世界和平的事业”，并保证“坚定不移地决心协助创造条件，以便可以利用现在掌握在人类手中的惊人的核子力量来为人类造福而不是毁灭人类”。但是，宣言最后还是说美国和英国要“发展并维持精神上、经济上和军事上的实力”，以达到宣言中所列举的目的。
