The crossbreeding of civilian horses at various horse breeding stations in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is currently being intensified.

According to statistics from the end of June, over 3,500 civilian horses have been bred throughout the region, accounting for approximately 60 percent of the annual civilian horse breeding plan. The Fayan Shen breeding station of the Machi Stud Farm and the Da Dai breeding station are performing even more excellently. As of mid-June, the Fayan Shen breeding station had completed 90 percent of its annual breeding task, and the Da Dai breeding station had completed its annual breeding task of breeding 450 civilian horses.

This year, the crossbreeding of civilian horses has progressed rapidly, with a large quantity and significant improvement in quality. In addition to emphasizing the daily feeding and management of stallions, the Da Dai breeding station has also paid attention to mating techniques. Therefore, farmers and herdsmen in Da Dai Township plan to breed all their mares this year and increase the conception rate to 68 percent. In order to do a good job in the crossbreeding of civilian horses, the Najitun Mechanical Farm not only issued instructions to its breeding stations requiring them to do a good job in protecting mating, protecting pregnancy, and protecting breeding, but also organized a ten-member observation team consisting of farm personnel, the Arong Banner People's Government, and technical responsible cadres from each breeding station. In June, they visited the breeding stations in six Nurtuks, including Naji, Arong, Horqin, Tubuxin, Geni, and Xing'an. Through observation and inspection, they achieved mutual learning, correctly implemented the artificial insemination operating procedures, improved techniques, and increased the conception rate.

    内蒙古自治区加紧进行民马配种工作
    内蒙古自治区各种马配种站的民马配种工作，目前正加紧进行。
    据六月底的统计，全区已配民马三千五百多匹，约占全年民马配种计划的百分之六十。麻池种马繁殖场法彦申配种站和大岱配种站工作更为出色。截至六月中旬，法彦申配种站完成全年配种任务的百分之九十；大岱配种站已完成全年四百五十匹民马的配种任务。
    今年民马配种工作进展快，配种数量多，质量也有很大的提高。大岱配种站除了重视种马的日常饲养管理外，他们还注意了交配的技术，因此，大岱乡的农牧民今年要把所有的骒马都进行配种，并要把受胎率提高到百分之六十八。那吉屯机械农场为了做好民马配种工作，不仅给该场各配种站发出要求做好保配、保胎和保育工作的指示，并由农场、阿荣旗人民政府、各配种站技术负责干部，组成十人观摩队，在六月间先后到那吉、阿荣、霍尔奇、图布新、格尼、兴安等六个努图克的配种站，通过观摩检查，达到互相学习，正确执行人工授精操作规程，提高技术，提高受胎率的目的。
