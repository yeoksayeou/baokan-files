Respected Chairman, Esteemed Ambassadors, Dear Guests,

On behalf of the government of the Polish People's Republic, and in my own name, I extend a warm welcome to you all for attending the celebration of the tenth anniversary of the national and social liberation of Poland.

Ten years ago, the heroic Soviet army, fighting shoulder to shoulder with the Polish army, liberated our country from the ravages of Hitlerite fascism.

In the ten years that the people have held power, we have driven out the landlords and capitalists, and we have completed epoch-making political, economic, and cultural revolutions.

We have achieved these accomplishments through the heroic efforts of the Polish people, and through the leadership of the Polish United Workers' Party, headed by our beloved leader, Bolesław Bierut.

We have achieved these accomplishments thanks to the friendly assistance of the great Soviet Union, the fraternal cooperation of the People's Republic of China, and the cooperation and friendship of the various people's democratic countries.

For the first time in history, the Polish and Chinese peoples have embarked on the path of fraternal cooperation, as demonstrated by the ever-growing economic and cultural exchanges and the common struggle for lasting peace.

The Polish people deeply admire the heroic Chinese people, who, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and its brilliant theorist and strategist, Comrade Mao Zedong, have liberated themselves from domestic feudalism and foreign imperialist enslavement.

The revolutionary changes in politics and the great achievements in economics, society, and culture over the past five years have made the People's Republic of China a pillar and source of inspiration for the people of Asia in their struggle for national and social liberation, and a decisive force in defending peace and freedom, and in protecting the independence of those nations that American imperialism seeks to enslave.

Due to the ever-increasing strength of the camp of freedom and peace headed by the Soviet Union, and due to the peaceful policies of the People's Republic of China, the imperialists have been forced to cease fire in Korea and have been forced to participate in the Berlin Conference and the Geneva Conference. World opinion has forced the imperialists to cease fire in Vietnam and to resolve the issue of easing international tensions.

The continuous growth of the strength of the camp of freedom and peace further strengthens our conviction that the People's Republic of China should obtain its legitimate seat in the United Nations, which will further promote friendship and cooperation between all countries.

Long live the lasting friendship and cooperation between the Polish people and the great Chinese people!

Long live the friendly cooperation between the People's Poland and the countries of the peaceful socialist camp!

Long live the great Soviet Union, the invincible fortress of peace and progress!

Long live the People's Republic of China, the pillar of peace in the Far East, and its great leader, Comrade Mao Zedong!

    基里洛克大使的讲话敬爱的主席同志、各位大使、亲爱的来宾：
    我谨代表波兰人民共和国政府，并以我个人的名义，热烈地欢迎你们来参加波兰民族与社会解放的十周年庆祝大会。
    十年以前，英雄的苏联军队与波兰军队并肩作战，把我们国家由希特勒法西斯的蹂躏下解放出来。
    在人民掌握政权的十年里，我们赶走了地主与资本家，我们完成了划时代的政治、经济与文化等方面的革命改变。
    我们获得了这些成就，是由于波兰人民的英勇努力，是由于以我们敬爱的领袖贝鲁特为首的波兰统一工人党的领导力量。
    我们获得了这些成就，应该感谢伟大的苏联的友好协助、中华人民共和国的兄弟般合作以及各人民民主国家的合作与友谊。
    波兰和中国人民在历史上第一次迈上了兄弟般合作的道路，这可以从日益增长着的经济与文化交流关系以及争取持久和平的共同斗争中表示出来。
    波兰人民极为钦佩英勇的中国人民，在中国共产党及其天才的理论家和战略家——毛泽东同志的领导下，把自己从国内封建主义与外国帝国主义奴役下解放了出来。
    五年来在政治上的革命改变，以及在经济、社会与文化上的巨大成就，已经使中华人民共和国成为亚洲人民争取民族与社会解放的支柱与鼓舞力量，成为保卫和平与自由、保卫那些美帝国主义企图奴役的各民族的独立的决定力量。
    由于以苏联为首的自由与和平阵营的力量在不断加强，由于中华人民共和国的和平政策，帝国主义者已被迫在朝鲜停战，已被迫参加柏林会议与日内瓦会议；世界舆论已迫使帝国主义者在越南停战，并解决缓和国际紧张局势的问题。
    自由与和平阵营力量的不断增长，更使我们深信：中华人民共和国应在联合国中取得合法的地位，这将进一步促进各国间的友好与合作。
    波兰人民与伟大的中国人民之间的持久友谊与合作万岁！
    人民波兰和和平社会主义阵营各国间的友好合作万岁！
    和平、进步的不可战胜的堡垒——伟大的苏联万岁！
    远东和平的支柱——中华人民共和国和它的伟大的领袖毛泽东同志万岁！
