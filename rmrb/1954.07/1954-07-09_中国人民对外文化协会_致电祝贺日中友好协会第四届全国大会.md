Xinhua News Agency, July 8th—The Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries sent a telegram to the Japan-China Friendship Association on July 8th, congratulating them on the Fourth National Congress of the Japan-China Friendship Association to be held in Osaka, Japan from July 9th to 11th. The full text of the congratulatory telegram is as follows: To the Fourth National Congress of the Japan-China Friendship Association:

    We are delighted to learn of the opening of your Fourth National Congress. We extend our warm congratulations.

    Over the past four years, especially in the past year, your association has made many efforts in strengthening the friendly cooperation between the people of China and Japan, developing cultural exchanges between the people of China and Japan, promoting equal and mutually beneficial trade between China and Japan, assisting overseas Chinese in Japan and Japanese nationals in China to return to their home countries, and escorting the remains of Chinese martyrs who died in Japan back to China.

    The Chinese people highly value the friendship with the Japanese people. The friendly cooperation between the people of China and Japan is of great significance for maintaining peace in the Far East and the world. Although the normal exchanges between the people of China and Japan are still subject to artificial obstruction, we firmly believe that the growing sincere desire for friendship between the people of China and Japan cannot be stopped by any artificial obstacles.

    At a time when peace-loving people all over the world are increasingly united and the forces demanding a relaxation of international tensions are growing, we wish your association's cause a thriving future and further and greater achievements!

    We wish the Fourth Congress a success!
