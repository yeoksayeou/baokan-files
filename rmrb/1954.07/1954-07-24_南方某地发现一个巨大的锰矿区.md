    A Huge Manganese Mine Discovered in Southern China
    A huge manganese mine is being explored in a certain area of Southern China. This manganese mine is a primary oxide ore, with abundant reserves and high manganese content, possessing great industrial mining value. Manganese is a very important raw material for the steel industry, and manganese mines are one of the minerals that our country is exploring in a planned way to develop the steel industry. Currently, in this vast manganese mining area, the exploration personnel, with the strong support of local farmers of all ethnic groups, have already dug thousands of shallow wells, dozens of trenches, and many exploration tunnels. In March and April of this year, hundreds of local farmers of all ethnic groups helped the manganese mine exploration team dig wells, take samples, and sometimes mobilized dozens of ox carts to help transport the ore. The vehicles moving through the mountains resembled a long snake.
    The exploration of this manganese mine began in April of last year. Until the end of last year, the exploration personnel only had a general understanding of the surface accumulation ore. Due to insufficient understanding of the origin of the ore, it was once estimated that the development prospects of the mining area were not great. Later, Soviet experts came to the mining area and made decisive judgments and suggestions on the origin of the ore and the direction of exploration, pointing out that the mining area had great hope. The help of the Soviet experts greatly increased the confidence of the exploration personnel in their work. Following the suggestions of the Soviet experts, they re-conducted the work on the surface accumulation ore, and since February, they have also been conducting exploration of the underlying layered ore at the same time. After several months of investigation, large and stable primary ore layers have been discovered in a wide range of areas, in many mountaintop tunnels. In order to thoroughly explore the scope and reserves of the layered ore, the exploration team is formulating an annual work plan and preparing to use drilling rigs for exploration.

    南方某地发现一个巨大的锰矿区
    南方某地正在勘探着一座巨大的锰矿。这个锰矿是原生氧化矿，藏量丰富，含锰率高，具有很大的工业开采价值。锰是钢铁工业很重要的一种原料，锰矿是我国为了发展钢铁工业而有计划地探寻的矿产之一。目前，在这个广阔的锰矿区内，勘探人员们取得当地各族农民群众的有力支援，已经挖好了几千个浅井，几十个探槽和许多探洞。今年三、四月间，每天都有几百个当地各族农民帮助锰矿勘探队挖井、取样，有时出动几十辆牛车帮助运矿。车辆在山间行进时，宛如一条长蛇。
    这个锰矿是在去年四月间开始勘探的。到去年年底以前，勘探人员们只对表面堆积矿作了一般的了解，由于对矿的成因认识不够，曾估计矿区的发展前途不大。后来，苏联专家来到矿区，对矿的成因和探矿方向作出了决定性的判断和建议，指明矿区有很大的希望。苏联专家的帮助大大提高了勘探人员们的工作信心。他们按照苏联专家的建议，重新补行了表面堆积矿的工作，自二月份开始又同时进行下面层状矿的勘探。经过几个月的追查，在范围很广的地区内，在许多山头坑道中，都发现了大而稳固的原生矿层。为了彻底探明层状矿的范围和储量，勘探队正拟订全年工作计划，并准备使用钻机钻探。（新华社）
