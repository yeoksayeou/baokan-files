Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 20th: The Soviet Government has twice sent notes to the U.S. government regarding the Soviet tanker "Tuapse" being seized by a warship of destroyer type in the seas near Taiwan Island controlled by the U.S. Navy. In its replies of June 26th and July 4th, the U.S. government verbally denied that the U.S. Navy had participated in the illegal action of seizing the Soviet tanker.

On July 19th, the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs delivered another note to the U.S. Embassy.

The note stated: The Soviet Government believes that the U.S. Government's note of July 4th continues to be limited to verbal denials of U.S. Navy involvement in this seizure, but fails to deny a well-known fact: the high seas area where this blatant violation of freedom of navigation occurred is under the control of the U.S. Navy. The Soviet Government believes that the U.S. Government bears full responsibility for the seizure of the Soviet tanker "Tuapse" and for ensuring the safety of its entire crew and the integrity of the ship and cargo.

The note stated: The Soviet Government once again protests the continued illegal detention of the "Tuapse" tanker and firmly demands the immediate release of the "Tuapse" tanker, its cargo, and its personnel. The Soviet Government reserves the right to demand compensation from the U.S. Government for the losses incurred by the Soviet Union due to the illegal seizure of the "Tuapse" tanker.

    苏联政府第三次照会美国政府
    要求立即释放苏联油船“图阿普斯”号
    【新华社二十一日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科二十日讯：苏联政府曾就苏联油船“图阿普斯号”在台湾岛附近美国海军控制的海面上被一艘驱逐舰型的军舰劫走一事两次照会美国政府。美国政府在六月二十六日和七月四日先后提出的复照空口否认美国海军曾参与劫走苏联油船的非法行动。
    七月十九日，苏联外交部再次递交美国大使馆照会一份。
    照会说：苏联政府认为，美国政府在七月四日的照会中仍旧仅限于空口否认美国海军曾参与这一劫夺行动，却没有否认一个众所周知的事实，即：发生这一粗暴地破坏航海自由的事件的公海区是在美国海军的控制之下的。苏联政府认为，美国政府应对劫走苏联油船“图阿普斯号”以及对保障它的全体船员的安全和船只与货物的完好负完全责任。
    照会说：苏联政府再次抗议继续非法扣留“图阿普斯号”油船，并坚决要求立即释放“图阿普斯号”油船及其货物和人员。苏联政府保留要求美国政府赔偿由于“图阿普斯号”油船被非法劫夺而给苏联带来的损失的权利。
