New China's Schools Open Doors to Children of Workers and Peasants

Dreams Become Reality

Even though exams were very stressful, Chen Shulan still squeezed out time to read the draft constitution. She said: "The draft constitution records the achievements of our revolutionary victory and reflects the common desire of the broad masses of the people to build a beautiful socialist society. How bright our youth's future is!"

Chen Shulan recalled: When I was little, my parents cared for me and saved every penny to send me to school for three years. After that, we couldn't afford it anymore. At the age of thirteen, I went to work in a cotton mill in Shashi, Chongqing. Every day, from dawn till dusk, I stood beside the machines, and my feet were always swollen. If you weren't careful, the foreman would hit you with a yarn tube or copper pipe, leaving bloody welts on your head. Or, they'd just snatch your apron and tell you to get lost. But now? The state protects children, and there are no more twelve or thirteen-year-old child laborers in factories. Every Sunday, when I see teams of children wearing red scarves happily going to the park or the Children's Palace to spend their holidays, I feel so happy and proud for them.

The draft constitution stipulates that citizens of the People's Republic of China have the right to education. This particularly warmed her heart. After liberation, her enthusiasm for production greatly increased. She and the sisters in her group humbly learned the Hao Jianxiu work method and created the doffing work method, accumulating a bit of wealth for the country. The state gave her the glorious title of National Textile Industry Labor Model. Now, the Party has sent her to Renmin University of China to study. During her studies, she faced many difficulties due to her low level of education, but the Party constantly encouraged and helped her, raising her level from primary school to high school in a short period of two years. Now, she is about to enter the undergraduate program. She said: All of this was truly a dream, a myth, before liberation! I must study hard, master science and technology, and participate in socialist construction as soon as possible, to contribute my greatest strength.

Jiang Wanshou's Autobiography

Jiang Wanshou grew up in a rural village in Shandong. Because his family was poor, his grandfather and father had never been to school. His father borrowed money from all sides to get Jiang Wanshou into school. Later, poverty forced him to drop out. At the age of eighteen, he wandered to the Northeast and barely managed to find a job as an apprentice in a clothing store. At night, after finishing work, he always liked to pick up a pen and practice writing on paper. One day, as he was practicing, the shopkeeper walked by and asked in a harsh voice, "What are you doing?" Jiang Wanshou was so scared that he didn't dare to say he was practicing writing, so he lied, "I'm writing a letter home."

He got away with it the first time. Soon, the shopkeeper saw him again, and he knew he couldn't hide it anymore, so he admitted, "I'm practicing writing." Sure enough, the shopkeeper flew into a rage: "What are you writing for? It's useless!" Jiang Wanshou ignored him. So, he practiced writing a third time. This time, the shopkeeper beat him without saying a word. Soon after, using the excuse that there wasn't much work, he kicked him out. In this way, Jiang Wanshou was deprived of his right to learn.

After liberation, Jiang Wanshou was promoted from a worker to a section chief, and later from a section chief to a deputy director of the factory. His work required him to have a higher level of education. Last October, the factory asked Jiang Wanshou to apply for the Workers' and Peasants' Rapid Middle School. This made him extremely happy, and he felt like flowers were blooming in his heart. He couldn't sleep for half the night that day. At the age of forty-three, Jiang Wanshou began his formal schooling.

After the draft constitution was published, Jiang Wanshou said excitedly: "Workers who were beaten everywhere in the old society can now go to college. I will strive to achieve excellent grades of five points in all subjects to welcome the birth of the first constitution of New China."

Workers Attend University

Huo Manhuan was originally a wood pattern worker at the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Mechanical General Factory. He said: I feel particularly close to Article 94 in the draft constitution, which states that "Citizens of the People's Republic of China have the right to education. The state establishes and gradually expands various schools and other cultural and educational institutions to guarantee that citizens enjoy this right." The motherland cares for the growth of the younger generation like a loving mother.

Huo Manhuan is the son of a poor peasant. During the Japanese occupation of Manchuria, he had studied for a few years. In his reminiscences, he said: "It was not easy to study back then. My family didn't own a single plot of land, and my father was half-blind. The two or three mu of rented land had to be cultivated by the whole family. There was no rice to eat at home, so I had to go to school on an empty stomach. Saying I was going to school was actually just messing around. I was absent from class every other day, because I had to bear the burden of supporting the family. At dawn, I would go out to sell my labor, covered in dew, and it was often dark when I returned home. Later, I couldn't afford school anymore, so I became an apprentice."

Soon after the liberation of Anshan, the factory established a cultural spare-time school. Huo Manhuan also participated in cultural studies. Later, he entered a cadre school and completed two years of high school courses. Last year, he entered the Northeast Institute of Technology. With the help of the Party, he received a full score of five in all seven of his subjects.

After studying the draft constitution, Huo Manhuan said: I want to study even harder to become a builder of the motherland.

The New Life of the Cowherd Boy

The provisions in the draft constitution regarding citizens' right to education greatly moved literary and art worker Gao Yubao. He said: "In the old society, no one cared even if you died, let alone study."

When he was little, he cried to go to school, but because his family had no money, his parents couldn't let him enter school. Mr. Zhou, the schoolteacher, was a kind man who allowed him to study for free. Who would have thought that after studying for just over a month, he was seen by the traitorous village head Zhou Changan, who forced his father to pay taxes. His father had no money to give, and Zhou Changan said fiercely: "This is a matter of public affairs, and you can't get away without paying. If you really have no money, then tell Yubao to herd pigs for me." His parents had no choice but to let Yubao herd pigs for the village head. In this way, Gao Yubao dropped out of school.

Poor children in the old society not only couldn't study, but they couldn't even go to school to see their teachers. One day, Gao Yubao herded pigs and went to school to see his teacher. As soon as he entered, the village head beat him hard with a stick, while gnashing his teeth and scolding: "This is not a place for you poor kids to come to. Get out! If I see you playing around at school again, I'll break your legs!"

After the liberation of the Northeast, Gao Yubao joined the People's Liberation Army. While following the troops in battles across the country, he also used the gaps in marching to study. From that time on, Gao Yubao truly began to read. Gao Yubao said: When I was a child, because life was so bad, I was full of illnesses when I joined the army. However, the organization treated my illnesses. When marching, comrades carried my backpack for me, and when we settled down, comrades told me to sleep on the heated kang; when I was a child, I couldn't study, but the leaders and comrades taught me to learn culture during the gaps in marching and fighting. Especially after I started writing books, in order to train me, the leaders asked comrades to help me in their busy schedules. In the old society, young people couldn't study, and children couldn't go to school, but now, going to school has become the right of every citizen. The state will gradually create conditions to guarantee us this right. Isn't this a great happy event for our young people? The state is so concerned about our young people. I must constantly improve my political and cultural level so that I can serve the people better!

    新中国的学校为工农子弟打开了大门
    梦想成为现实
    虽然考试十分紧张，陈树兰还是挤出时间阅读了宪法草案。她说：“宪法草案记载了我们革命胜利的成果，反映了广大人民建设美好的社会主义社会的共同愿望。我们青年的前途是多么光明灿烂啊！”
    陈树兰回忆说：我年纪小的时候，爹娘心疼我，省吃省穿让我读了三年小学，以后就再也上不起学了。十三岁就进了重庆沙市纱厂做工，每天从早到晚两头不亮地站在机器旁，连脚都站肿了。只要稍不留神，工头就用纱管、铜管打你，打得你头上连起血泡。再不，就把围裙一夺，叫你滚蛋。可是现在呢？国家保护儿童，工厂里再也没有十二、三岁的童工了。每逢星期天，当我看到一队队围着红领巾的少年儿童，愉快地到公园或少年宫去度他们的假日时，我真为他们感到幸福和自豪。
    宪法草案规定：中华人民共和国公民有受教育的权利。特别使她感到温暖。解放以后，她在生产上的劲头大大提高了，她和小组的姐妹们虚心学习了郝建秀工作法，创造了落纱工作法，给国家积累了一点儿财富，国家便给了她全国纺织工业劳动模范的光荣称号。现在，党又把她送到中国人民大学来学习。在学习中，她因文化水平低，困难很多，党又不断鼓励她、帮助她，在短短的两年内，把她从初小程度提高到高中程度。现在，她即将升入大学本科了。她说：这一切在解放前，那真是梦想，真是神话啊！我一定要好好学习，掌握科学技术，早日参加社会主义建设，以尽自己最大的一份力量。
    姜万寿的自述
    姜万寿生长在山东的一个农村里，因为家穷，祖父和父亲都没有念过书。他父亲东借西凑，好不容易给姜万寿入了学。后来穷困生活逼得他失学了。十八岁上他流浪到东北，好歹才找到一家服装店当学徒。晚上，在工作完了之后，他总爱拿起笔来在纸上练习写字。有一次正当他练字的时候，掌柜走过来了，恶声地问道：“你干什么？”姜万寿吓得不敢说练习写字，只好撒谎：“我给家写一封信。”
    头一次这样侥幸混过去了。很快，第二次又被掌柜的看见了，他知道已经无法再隐瞒，就承认了：“我练习练习字。”果然，掌柜的发了雷霆：“你写它干啥，没有用！”姜万寿没有理会他。于是，他又第三次练字。这次，掌柜的不容分说，就揍了他一顿。不久，借口活计不多，就把他一脚踢开了。就这样姜万寿被剥夺了学习的权利。
    解放后姜万寿由一个工人提拔为股长，以后又由科长提拔为副厂长。工作需要他有较高的文化程度。去年十月，工厂方面让姜万寿去投考工农速成中学。这使他高兴极了，心里乐得像开了花，当天夜里半宿没睡着觉。四十三岁的姜万寿从这时开始了正规的学习生活。
    宪法草案公布后，姜万寿激动地说：“在旧社会处处都要挨揍的工人，现在可以上大学了。我一定争取全部功课达到五分的优秀成绩，来迎接新中国第一个宪法的诞生。”
    工人上了大学
    霍满宦原是鞍山钢铁公司机械总厂的木型工人。他说：我对宪法草案中的第九十四条“中华人民共和国公民有受教育的权利。国家设立并且逐步扩大各种学校和其他文化教育机关，以保证公民享受这种权利”特别感到亲切。祖国像慈母般地关怀着青年一代的成长。
    霍满宦是一个贫农的儿子。在伪满时期，他曾念过几年书。他在回忆中说：“那时念书好不容易。我家地无一垄，父亲又是双目半失明；租来的两三亩地得靠全家老少一齐侍弄。家里没有米吃，我只好饿着肚子去上学。说是上学，实际上只是在学校里混罢了；我三天两头的缺课，因为我必须把家庭的生活重担担负起来。天一亮，我就顶着露水去卖小工，回家时往往天已漆黑。后来，上不起学了，就当了学徒。”
    鞍山解放后不久，工厂里成立文化业余学校。霍满宦也就参加了文化学习。后来他又进了干部学校，学完了高中二年的课程。去年，他进了东北工学院，在党的帮助下，他的七门功课全得了五分。
    霍满宦在学习宪法草案后表示：我要更好地进行学习，使自己成为祖国的建设者。放猪娃的新生命
    宪法草案中关于公民有受教育的权利的规定，使文艺战士高玉宝受到很大的感动。他说：“在旧社会里，死了都没有人管，学习更谈不到了。”
    当他小的时候，哭着要去读书，因为家中没有钱，父母没法让他进学校。学校的周先生是个善良的人，免费允许他去求学。谁想到才读了一个多月书，被汉奸保长周长安看见了，就逼着他的父亲要税钱。父亲没有钱给，周长安凶狠地说：“这是公事，不给钱可不行，要是真没有钱，就叫玉宝给我放猪去。”父母没有办法，只得叫玉宝给保长去放猪。就这样高玉宝就失学了。
    穷孩子在旧社会里不但不能读书，就是去学校看看老师都不行。有一天高玉宝赶猪顺便去学校看老师，一进门保长用棒子狠狠地打他，还一边咬牙切齿地骂：“这地方也是你们穷小子来的，快滚出去！我再看你到学校来玩，就打断你的腿！”
    东北解放后，高玉宝参加了人民解放军，他一面随着部队转战各地，一面利用行军中的空隙进行学习。从那个时候开始，高玉宝才真正开始读书。高玉宝说：我小时候，因为生活太坏，到部队时还满身是病，可是，组织方面给我治病，行军的时候，同志们替我背背包，住下来时，同志们叫我睡热炕；我小时候不能读书，首长和同志们在行军作战的空隙中，还教我学文化；特别是我开始写书后，首长们为了培养我，还叫同志在百忙中来帮助我。在旧社会里，青年人不能学习，孩子们不能读书，可是现在，上学校成为我们每个公民的权利了。国家将逐步地创造条件保证我们这个权利，这难道不是我们青年人的一件大喜事么？国家对我们青年人这么关怀，我一定要不断提高政治、文化水平，以便更好地为人民服务！
