    New Method for Manufacturing Glucose
    The Northeast Pharmaceutical General Factory has successfully tested using water crystallization instead of alcohol crystallization to manufacture glucose, which can save the country 12 billion yuan of wealth annually. In the past, about 1.5 kilograms of alcohol were required to crystallize one kilogram of sugar. The process from raw materials to finished products involved eleven steps, and the used alcohol gas evaporated in large quantities in the workshop, easily causing combustion and affecting the health of workers.
    As early as 1951, factory leaders organized technicians to study this issue, but the result was failure. It was not until 1953, under the suggestion and guidance of Soviet experts, that this problem was solved. Small-scale production tests showed that using water crystallization to manufacture glucose not only simplified the process compared to the past, but also saved 1,200 tons of alcohol annually and benefited the health of workers. Now, they have developed a plan to manufacture a complete set of equipment, which can be put into mass production after installation.

    制造葡萄糖的新方法
    东北制药总厂用水结晶代替酒精结晶制造葡萄糖，已试验成功，一年能给国家节省一百二十亿元财富。过去每一公斤糖大约要用一公斤半酒精来结晶，从原材料到成品要经过十一道工序，而且，用过的酒精气体，大量挥发在车间里，容易引起燃烧，对工人身体健康也有影响。
    早在一九五一年，工厂领导上就组织技术人员研究过这个问题，结果失败了。直到一九五三年经苏联专家建议和指导，才把这个问题解决了。经小型生产试验，用水结晶方法制造葡萄糖，工序既不像过去那样复杂，每年又能节省一千二百吨酒精，对工人健康还有好处。现在，他们已作出制造全套设备的计划，安装后即可大量生产。
