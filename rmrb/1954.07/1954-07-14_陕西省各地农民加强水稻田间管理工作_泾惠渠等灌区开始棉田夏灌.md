Farmers in Various Parts of Shaanxi Province Strengthen Field Management of Rice Paddies
Jinghui Canal and Other Irrigation Areas Begin Summer Irrigation of Cotton Fields

By mid-June, over 2.1 million mu of rice in Shaanxi Province had been transplanted. Currently, the seedlings have turned green and are generally growing well. To strive for a bumper rice harvest, farmers in various regions are working intensely on field management tasks such as topdressing fertilizer, weeding, and preventing and controlling pests and diseases.

This year, rice transplanting techniques in various areas have generally improved compared to last year. In addition to applying base fertilizer and carefully preparing the land based on cultivating strong seedlings, reasonable close planting has been universally implemented. In Yangxian County, the 155,000+ mu of old paddy fields generally increased from over 7,000 seedlings per mu last year to over 8,000 seedlings per mu. Many agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams are planting as densely as around 9,000 seedlings per mu. In Tianzhuang Village, Chenggu, out of the village's 394+ mu of paddy fields, 371 mu implemented reasonable close planting, accounting for 94.18% of the total area. The Xingfu Agricultural Production Cooperative in Hujiaying Township, Lengshui District, Nanzheng County, created a "close planting ruler" to overcome the previous shortcomings of "dense mouths and sparse hands" in transplanting. This not only ensured equidistant close planting but also improved transplanting efficiency. Some agricultural cooperatives and mutual aid teams also promptly inspected the fields and replanted seedlings after transplanting, overcoming previous phenomena such as missing seedlings, floating seedlings, and single seedlings, ensuring full seedling establishment.

The summer irrigation of cotton fields in state-owned canals such as Jinghui, Luohui, and Weihui in Shaanxi Province is proceeding intensely.

By July 8th, the Jinghui Canal had irrigated over 170,000 mu of cotton fields for the first time, accounting for more than half of the 330,000 mu of cotton fields in the irrigation area. By July 5th, the Luohui Canal had irrigated 32% of the cotton fields in the entire irrigation area for the first time. The Weihui Canal also officially started the first round of water distribution for cotton fields on July 6th. In the Qinghe and Zhuohe private canal irrigation areas of Sanyuan County, there are over 35,000 mu of cotton fields this year, and more than half of them had been irrigated for the first time by July 7th. Currently, cotton is generally growing well in the irrigation areas, with plant heights exceeding one chi (approximately 1/3 meter), and an average of 10 to 15 flower buds already formed per plant. The cotton that has been irrigated is growing even more vigorously, nearly one cun (approximately 3.3 centimeters) taller than the unirrigated cotton.

Before the start of cotton field irrigation and during water release, Party and government organizations at all levels in the irrigation areas and canal management departments specifically mobilized and led the masses to carry out ditch digging and ridging work. According to preliminary statistics from the Weihui Canal irrigation area, approximately more than half of the cotton fields in the irrigation area have already been ditched, especially mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives have completed ditching all cotton fields, laying a good foundation for shallow and frequent irrigation and economical water use.

This year, the Jinghui, Luohui, and Weihui state-owned canals analyzed historical hydrological and meteorological data based on Soviet irrigation technology and advanced theories, calculated the possible water supply during various periods of summer irrigation, and formulated more detailed and thorough water allocation plans in conjunction with the specific conditions of the irrigation areas. They also assigned full-time water allocation cadres to specifically implement water allocation work. The Luohui and Weihui Canals have also established water distribution stations, creating conditions for planned water distribution. (Li Yongzhong)

    陕西省各地农民加强水稻田间管理工作
    泾惠渠等灌区开始棉田夏灌
    陕西省二百一十多万亩水稻至六月中旬先后插秧完毕。目前秧苗已经返青，一般生长良好。为了争取水稻丰收，各地农民正紧张进行追肥、捞稻、薅草和防治病虫害等田间管理工作。
    今年各地的稻田插秧技术，一般较去年提高一步。除在培育壮秧的基础上增施基肥、精细整地外，普遍实行了合理密植。洋县全县十五万五千多亩老水田，一般由去年每亩七千多窝增加到八千多窝。有不少农业生产合作社、互助组密植到九千窝左右。城固天庄村全村三百九十四亩多稻田，实行合理密植的即有三百七十一亩，占总面积百分之九十四点一八。南郑县冷水区胡家营乡幸福农业生产合作社，为了克服以往插秧中“口密手稀”的缺点，创造了“密植尺”，不但保证了等距密植，而且还提高了插秧效率。一些农业社和互助组在插秧后还及时进行了查窝、补苗，克服了以往缺窝、漂秧、放单等现象，保证了全苗。
    陕西省泾惠、洛惠、渭惠等国营渠道的棉田夏灌工作正在紧张进行。
    泾惠渠到七月八日已灌过头遍的棉田约有十七万多亩，占灌区三十三万亩棉田的一半以上。洛惠渠到七月五日灌过头遍的棉田已达全灌区棉田的百分之三十二。渭惠渠从七月六日也正式开始了棉田第一次轮水。三原县清、浊河民营渠道灌区今年共有棉田三万五千多亩，到七月七日也有一半以上灌过了头遍水。目前，各灌区棉花一般生长良好，株高一市尺以上，平均每株已成长的花蕾有十个到十五个，尤以灌过的棉花生长更为茁壮，较未灌的高出近一公寸。
    在棉田开始灌溉前与放水中，灌区各级党政机关和渠道管理部门，具体动员、领导群众进行了开沟、打畦工作。据渭惠渠灌区初步统计，目前已开过沟的棉田约占灌区棉田面积的一半以上，特别是互助组和农业生产合作社已将全部棉田开好沟，为浅灌勤浇经济用水打好基础。
    今年泾惠、洛惠、渭惠等国营渠道，根据苏联的灌溉技术与先进理论，分析了历年水文、气象资料，推算出夏灌中各个时期的可能供水量，并结合灌区具体情况，制定了较详细周密的配水计划，调配了专职配水干部，具体执行调配水量工作，洛惠、渭惠两渠并成立了配水站，为有计划配水创设了条件。（李永忠）
