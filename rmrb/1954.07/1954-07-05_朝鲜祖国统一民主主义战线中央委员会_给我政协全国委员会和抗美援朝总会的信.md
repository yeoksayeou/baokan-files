To: The National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the General Association to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea:
    Today, the Central Committee of the Korean Democratic Front for the Unification of the Fatherland listened to the return report of the Korean People's Delegation to China with the greatest gratitude and satisfaction.

    The Korean People's Delegation to China was warmly welcomed by the fraternal Chinese people and, under the deep concern and active assistance of the Communist Party of China and the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, completed its task of further consolidating the traditional friendship and solidarity between the peoples of Korea and China, strengthening cultural exchanges between the two countries, and absorbing the valuable experience of the Chinese people in building a new China before returning home.

    We would like to express our sincere gratitude to you for the love and friendship shown by the fraternal Chinese people to the Korean People's Delegation.

    The sincere care and friendship shown to our delegation by the Chinese people is a clear manifestation of the fraternal Chinese people's fighting friendship with the Korean people and the unbreakable internationalist friendship and solidarity between the peoples of Korea and China. This infinitely encourages the Korean people to rise up and fight for the peaceful unification of the motherland and the restoration and construction of the post-war people's economy. Moreover, from the delegation's report, we heard about the great achievements made by the great Chinese people in the struggle for socialist construction under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong, and the scenes of the Chinese people living free and happy lives and continuing to strengthen the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, and we felt new joy and excitement. The great labor achievements made by the great Chinese people following the general line of the Communist Party of China, the achievements and valuable experience gained in politics, economy, and culture have great educational significance for the Korean people who are rising up to restore and build the post-war people's economy, and become a model for the Korean people to learn from.

    This time, our delegation's visit to China contributed to the consolidation and development of the internationalist friendship and solidarity forged in blood by the peoples of Korea and China in the fierce three-year war against the American imperialists and in defense of peace in Asia and the world.

    The flesh-and-blood friendship between the peoples of Korea and China is being increasingly consolidated into an invincible force.

    The iron-like solid friendship and solidarity between the peoples of Korea and China cannot be broken by any aggressive forces. The American imperialists and their running dog, the Syngman Rhee clique, disrupted the discussion of the Korean question at the Geneva Conference and are plotting to re-launch the war. However, under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and the respected and beloved leader Marshal Kim Il-sung, with the strong support of the peace and democracy camp headed by the great Soviet Union, the Korean people will surely smash any conspiracy of the American imperialists and the Syngman Rhee clique and achieve victory in the sacred struggle to restore and build the post-war people's economy and peacefully unify the motherland.

    We are confident that the fraternal Chinese people will achieve even greater success in the struggle for the socialist construction of great China and for peace in Asia and the world. We wish Chairman Mao Zedong, the beloved leader of the Chinese people, a long life.

        The Central Committee of the Korean Democratic Front for the Unification of the Fatherland

    今天，朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线中央委员会以最大的感激和满足听取了朝鲜人民访华代表团的归还报告。
    朝鲜人民访华代表团受到了兄弟般的中国人民的热烈的欢迎，并在中国共产党和中华人民共和国中央人民政府的深切关怀和积极帮助之下，完成了为进一步巩固朝中两国人民的有着传统的友谊团结，加强两国的文化交流和吸取中国人民建设新中国的宝贵经验的任务后，归国了。
    我们对于兄弟般的中国人民对朝鲜人民访华代表团表示的热爱和友谊，谨向您们致以深切的感谢。
    中国人民对我们代表团表示的真诚的爱护和友谊，就是兄弟般的中国人民对朝鲜人民的战斗友谊和朝中两国人民牢不可破的国际主义友谊团结的明白的表现。这无限地鼓舞了朝鲜人民奋起进行为和平统一祖国和恢复建设战后人民经济的斗争。并且，我们从代表团的报告中，听到伟大的中国人民在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，进行的社会主义建设斗争中所取得的巨大的成就，和中国人民过着自由幸福的生活，并继续加强着抗美援朝运动的情景，感到了新的喜悦和激动。伟大的中国人民遵循着中国共产党的总路线，建立的伟大的劳动功勋，在政治、经济、文化各方面取得的成就和宝贵的经验，对正在奋起恢复建设战后人民经济的朝鲜人民有着巨大的教育意义，并成为朝鲜人民学习的榜样。
    这次，我们代表团的访问中国，对朝中两国人民巩固和发展过去在反对美帝国主义者，保卫亚洲和世界和平的激烈的三年战争中，以鲜血结成的国际主义友谊团结，作出了贡献。
    朝中两国人民的血肉相连的友谊关系，日益巩固成为不可战胜的力量。
    朝中两国人民钢铁般的巩固的友谊团结，是任何侵略势力都不能打破的。美帝国主义者和它的走狗李承晚集团破坏了日内瓦会议关于朝鲜问题的讨论，并阴谋重新发动战争。但是朝鲜人民在朝鲜劳动党和敬爱的领袖金日成元帅的领导下，在伟大的苏联为首的和平民主阵营的有力支持下，必将粉碎美帝国主义者和李承晚集团的任何阴谋，在恢复建设战后人民经济与和平统一祖国的神圣斗争中取得胜利。
  我们确信，兄弟般的中国人民在为伟大中国的社会主义建设和亚洲及世界和平的斗争中，将取得更巨大的成就。谨祝中国人民的敬爱的领袖毛泽东主席万寿无疆。
