Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, July 13th: Farmers in Jining Prefecture, Shandong Province, are selling significantly more wheat to the state than in previous years. From the beginning of the new wheat season to July 6th, the state's wheat procurement in the entire prefecture has increased by 48% compared to the same period last year. Teng County, Ziyang, Xuecheng, Zou County, and Qufu County have all completed more than 60% of this year's wheat procurement plan.

This year, the state prepaid over 10 billion yuan in advance payments for wheat in this area, and supply and marketing cooperatives supplied 26 million catties of fertilizer. The total wheat production in the entire prefecture increased by 13% compared to last year. Among the thirteen counties, the average yield per mu in eight counties exceeded the level of the bumper year of 1952. While celebrating the harvest, farmers are actively selling their surplus grain to the state. The Wang Guangsheng mutual aid team in Xitang Village, Xuecheng County, quickly threshed and winnowed their wheat as soon as it was harvested, and sold 3,000 catties of wheat to the state. Farmers in Ziyang County, under the slogan "The state helps us increase production, and we must sell more patriotic grain to support national construction," have already sold 8 million catties of wheat, accounting for 61% of the county's procurement plan. When discussing the wheat harvest, farmers in Houpu Township, Jining County, like to talk about the fact that the government supplied the entire township with more than 30,000 catties of oil cakes and some new farm tools last autumn, and they like to talk even more about the news that the government will establish an agricultural machinery station here this autumn. They said that the state's help to farmers is getting bigger year by year, and our support to the state must also increase year by year. By July 7th, the entire township had sold more than 270,000 catties of surplus grain, which was 20,000 catties more than the original plan and more than 70,000 catties more than the wheat sold to the state last year.

    山东济宁专区农民出售小麦大大超过往年
    【新华社济南十三日电】山东省济宁专区农民向国家出售的小麦大大超过了往年。从新麦登场开始到七月六日，国家在全专区已经收购的小麦比去年同期的收购量增加了百分之四十八。滕县、滋阳、薛城、邹县、曲阜等五个县，现在都已经完成今年小麦收购计划的百分之六十以上。
    今年国家在这个地区预购小麦发放了上百亿元的订金，供销合作社供应了二千六百万斤肥料。全专区小麦的总产量比去年增加了百分之十三。在十三个县中，有八个县的每亩平均产量超过了一九五二年丰收年的水平。农民们在喜庆丰收同时，积极把余粮卖给国家。薛城县西堂村的王广胜互助组刚收完小麦，就快晒快扬，把三千斤小麦卖给了国家。滋阳县的农民们在“国家帮助咱增产，咱也要多卖爱国粮支援国家建设”的口号下，已经出售了八百万斤小麦，占全县收购计划的百分之六十一。济宁县后铺乡的农民在讨论小麦丰收时，都喜欢谈论去年秋天政府供应全乡三万多斤油饼和一部分新农具的事实，更喜欢谈论今年秋天政府将要在这里建立农业机器站的消息。他们说，国家对农民的帮助一年比一年大，咱对国家的支援也要一年比一年多。到七月七日，全乡就卖了二十七万多斤余粮，比原定计划多了两万斤，比去年卖给国家的小麦多了七万多斤。
