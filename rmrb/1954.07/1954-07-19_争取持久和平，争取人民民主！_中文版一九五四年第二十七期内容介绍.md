"Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" the Chinese edition of the newspaper of the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties, 1954, Issue 27, has been published.

In its editorial titled "For Peace and the Security of All Peoples," this issue points out that a broad spectrum of world opinion has noted with satisfaction that international tensions have recently eased somewhat. This is the result of the active opposition of the forces of peace to the forces of aggression. However, we must not overestimate the significance of this relaxation, because those who oppose the consolidation of peace, especially the powerful figures in the United States, have not abandoned their aggressive intentions. Therefore, under the current circumstances, the main task of the forces of peace is to shatter the plans of the aggressive blocs, strive for a further easing of international tensions, do everything possible to promote peaceful cooperation between countries, and resolutely oppose propaganda aimed at inciting hatred among peoples and brewing and launching new wars. It is clear that international tensions cannot be further eased unless the issue of a ceasefire in Indochina is resolved. A thorough resolution of the Korean issue, the German issue, and preventing the revival of German militarism are of paramount importance for maintaining peace and further easing international tensions. The peoples of all countries also realize that the establishment of a collective security system can consolidate peace and security in Europe and Asia, safeguard the sovereignty of all countries, and ease international tensions. The editorial then points out the great significance of events such as the start of electricity generation at the Soviet Union's first atomic power plant, the recent talks between Zhou Enlai and Nehru, and the International Conference for Relaxation of Tension held in Stockholm in June. The editorial emphasizes that to further ease international tensions, it is necessary to normalize relations between the major powers. Restoring all the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China, including its legitimate rights in the United Nations, is an urgent international task.

This issue contains important articles including: "The Victorious Completion of Grassroots Elections in China" by Deng Xiaoping, Member and Secretary-General of the Central Election Committee of the People's Republic of China; "On Developing International Economic Relations" by M. Constantinescu, Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party; and "The New Situation and the Tasks of the Communist Party of Germany" by Max Reimann, Chairman of the Communist Party of Germany.

Constantinescu's article first analyzes the flourishing economy of the democratic world market and the increasingly declining economy of the capitalist world market, discussing the serious impact of the U.S.'s economic blockade policy and signs of economic crisis on the economies of Western European countries, as well as the development of the movement to strive for trade with the democratic market in the capitalist world. The article points out that the existence of two completely different economic systems, socialism and capitalism, does not mean that they should be isolated from each other. Businessmen in capitalist countries have taken preliminary steps to restore traditional trade relations with Eastern countries. The growing economic strength of the democratic camp enables these countries to be willing to increase the volume of goods exchanged with capitalist countries on the principle of equality and mutual benefit. The numerous economic agreements signed between capitalist countries and democratic countries throughout 1953 and the first few months of 1954 mark the beginning of this trend in capitalist countries. The article says that the establishment of normal economic relations and the development of trade relations between East and West are an important factor in easing international tensions and striving for lasting world peace.

Reimann's article points out that recently the momentum of the German people's struggle for national self-determination has grown even stronger. Since the German Democratic Republic already has full sovereignty to decide its relations with West Germany, no one can now insist that the issue of restoring national unity and resolving the relations between the two parts of Germany is solely a matter for the four occupying powers. We Communists believe that, in view of the current situation in West Germany, the policy of West Germany must be changed. The party's central task is to establish the united action of the working class, oppose militarism and chauvinism, oppose the "European Defense Community" policy, strive for peace, national unity, and democracy, and strive for the social interests of the working class.

     “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版一九五四年第二十七期内容介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”一九五四年第二十七期中文版已经出版。
    本期在题为“为了和平和各国人民的安全”的社论中指出：全世界广大舆论界欣慰地注意到，最近国际紧张局势已经有了一些缓和。这是和平力量积极反对侵略势力的结果。但是，我们不要过高估计这种缓和的意义，因为反对巩固和平的人们，首先是美国的当权人物并没有放弃他们的侵略意图。因此，在目前的情况下，和平力量的主要任务就是粉碎侵略集团的计划，争取国际紧张局势的进一步缓和，竭力促进各国之间的和平合作，并坚决反对那些旨在煽动各国人民互相仇视、酝酿和发动新战争的宣传。很明显，除非印度支那停战问题获得解决，国际紧张局势就不可能得到进一步缓和。彻底解决朝鲜问题、解决德国问题，阻止德国军国主义的复活，对于维护和平和进一步缓和国际紧张局势有着极重大的意义。各国人民还认识到，建立集体安全体系就能巩固欧、亚两洲的和平和安全，就能维护各国的主权和缓和国际紧张局势。社论接着指出了苏联第一个原子能电力站的开始发电、周恩来和尼赫鲁最近的会谈、六月间在斯德哥尔摩举行的缓和局势国际会议等事件的重要意义。社论着重说，要进一步缓和国际紧张局势，必须使各大国之间的关系正常化。恢复中华人民共和国的一切合法权利，包括它在联合国的合法权利，是一项刻不容缓的国际任务。
    本期刊载的重要文章有：中华人民共和国中央选举委员会委员兼秘书长邓小平的“中国基层选举胜利完成”，罗马尼亚工人党中央政治局委员米·康斯坦丁尼斯库的“论发展国际经济关系”，德国共产党主席马·雷曼的“新形势和德国共产党的任务”。
    康斯坦丁尼斯库的文章首先分析了民主世界市场的经济蒸蒸日上和资本主义世界市场的经济日益衰退的情形，论述了美国的经济封锁政策和经济危机的征兆对于西欧国家经济的严重影响，以及争取和民主市场进行贸易的运动在资本主义世界的发展情况。文章指出：社会主义和资本主义两种绝不相同的经济制度的存在，并不意味着它们应彼此隔绝。资本主义各国的商界人士已采取了初步措施来恢复和东方国家的传统贸易关系。民主阵营各国日益增长的经济力量使这些国家能够和愿意增加货物交换的资本主义国家根据平等互利的原则增加换货额。一九五三年全年和一九五四年头几个月资本主义国家和民主国家签订的许多经济协定，就是资本主义国家中这种趋势的开始。文章说：东西方之间的正常经济关系的建立和贸易关系的发展是缓和国际紧张局势、争取全世界持久和平的一个重要因素。
    雷曼的文章指出：最近德国人民争取民族自决的斗争的声势更加壮大了。由于德意志民主共和国已经具有充分的主权来决定自己和西德的关系，现在已经没有人可以硬说恢复全国统一的问题和解决德国两部分之间的关系的问题，只是四个占领国的事。我们共产党人认为，鉴于目前西德的形势，必须改变西德的施政方针。党的中心任务就是建立工人阶级的统一行动，反对军国主义和沙文主义，反对“欧洲防务集团”政策，争取和平、全国统一和民主，争取工人阶级的社会利益。　（新华社）
