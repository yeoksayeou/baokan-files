Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng, July 12th: Thirty-one agricultural production cooperatives in Xuchang County, Henan Province, produced a total of 1,019,541 jin of wheat this year. After deducting the public grain that each cooperative should hand over to the state this summer, the rations needed by the members, seeds, and fodder, they will sell 300,300 jin of surplus wheat to the state. This decision was made at the county-wide meeting of agricultural production cooperative directors held by the Xuchang County Committee of the Communist Party of China in late June and was supported by all members of each cooperative. At this meeting, all the directors also passed an open letter to the peasants of the county, reporting on their good wheat harvest this year and the glorious deeds of the members who actively sold patriotic surplus grain. Now, the Xuchang County Committee of the Communist Party of China has printed and distributed this open letter to the peasants of the county, calling on them to learn from the model actions of the agricultural production cooperatives in actively increasing grain production and actively selling surplus grain.

In recent days, members of the various agricultural production cooperatives in Xuchang County have been busily selecting and drying wheat, preparing to sell the best grain to the state. The 27 members of the Mingxing Agricultural Production Cooperative in Hezhuang Township, Sixth District, after discussing the cooperative affairs committee's plan to sell 22,000 jin of wheat this summer, had ten households deliver the dried and cleaned, plump wheat to the cooperative affairs committee the next day.

Thirty of the thirty-one agricultural production cooperatives in Xuchang County were established after the state implemented the planned purchase and supply of grain last winter. After their establishment, they unified the use of land, rationally organized the labor force, and used the money from selling surplus grain last year to dig 65 water wells, buy 63 waterwheels, 48 new-style walking plows and double-shared plows, more than 300 head of livestock, and nearly 100,000 jin of fertilizer. They invested in production, improved farming conditions, and expanded the area of multiple cropping, so that the average yield per unit area of wheat was 14% higher than that of ordinary mutual aid groups in the area and 29% higher than that of ordinary individual farmers in the area.

    河南省许昌县三十一个农业生产合作社
    决定把三十万零三千斤小麦卖给国家
    【新华社开封十二日电】河南省许昌县三十一个农业生产合作社今年共生产小麦一百零一万九千五百四十一斤，除去各社今年夏季应交纳给国家的公粮、社员需要的口粮、种籽和饲料外，将把三十万零三千斤剩余小麦卖给国家。这一决定是六月下旬在中共许昌县委员会召开的全县农业生产合作社社长会议上通过的，并得到各社全体社员的支持。在这次社长会议上，全体社长还通过了一封给全县农民的公开信，报告他们今年小麦丰收的情况和社员们积极出售爱国余粮的光荣事迹。现在，中共许昌县委员会已把这一公开信印发给全县农民，号召全县农民学习农业生产合作社这种积极增产粮食和积极出售余粮的模范行动。
    近几天来，许昌县各个农业生产合作社的社员们都正紧张地拣麦、晒麦，准备把最好的粮食卖给国家。第六区贺庄乡明星农业生产合作社的二十七户社员，在讨论了社务委员会今年夏季出售小麦二万二千斤的计划后，第二天就有十户社员把晒干、拣净的粒粒饱满的小麦送到社务委员会。
    许昌县的三十一个农业生产合作社有三十个是去年冬季国家实行粮食计划收购和计划供应后建立起来的。他们在建社以后，统一使用土地，合理组织了劳动力，并用去年售出余粮的钱打了六十五眼水井，买了六十三部水车、四十八部新式步犁和双铧犁、三百多头牲口及近十万斤肥料，投入生产，改善耕作条件、扩大复播面积，使小麦平均单位面积产量，比当地一般互助组高出一成四，比当地一般单干农民高出二成九。
