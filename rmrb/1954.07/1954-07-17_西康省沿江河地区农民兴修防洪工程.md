Farmers in the riverside agricultural areas of Ya'an and Xichang Special Districts, Tibetan Autonomous Region, and Liangshan Yi Autonomous Region in Xikang Province are actively building and renovating many flood control projects. Farmers in the Anning River area of Xichang and Miyi counties, in addition to renovating, reinforcing, or expanding the original dikes and dams, have also built many flood control dikes and revetments dozens of meters long, and built many water interception dams. Farmers in the Qiangjiang River area of Lushan, Ya'an and other counties, while repairing and reinforcing flood control projects, building flood control embankments and water diversion embankments, also knocked down and blasted many large stone outcrops standing in the river that obstructed the water flow, or deepened and widened the riverbed to lower the water level, unblock the water flow, and prevent floods from rising sharply during high water and threatening production. After the flood control projects have been built, repaired, and reinforced in various places, the flood resistance capacity has been greatly strengthened, and they can generally play the role of "reducing disasters in large floods and avoiding disasters in small floods." After widening the riverbed and removing the large rocks in the riverbed that obstruct the water flow in the flood control project in Longmen Township, Lushan County, the water level has dropped, and more than 200 residents in Qinglongchang and the farmland in the seventh and eighth villages are no longer threatened by floods. The flood control project in Salian Township, Miyi County, can also ensure that more than 1,000 mu of farmland are protected from flood damage. In addition, in areas close to mountain streams and small rivers and in some high mountain areas or areas with relatively flat and low-lying terrain that are prone to floods and waterlogging, many farmers, led by mutual aid groups and agricultural production cooperatives, have also dug many mountain interception weirs, flood control ditches, and drainage canals to divert floodwaters into rivers. In Xiaosheng Village, Longdong Township, Baoxing County, farmers living near Yinshan, based on the fact that the soil of Yinshan is wet and has strong water retention capacity, and waterlogging is very likely to occur when it rains, generally dig many drainage ditches around or in the middle of the land under the leadership of mutual aid groups. Farmers near Yangshan, based on the fact that the slope of Yangshan is relatively large, and crops are extremely easily damaged by mountain floods when it rains heavily, have dug many mountain interception weirs and drainage ditches to prevent mountain floods. Some mutual aid groups have also dug ponds to store water and prevent drought while preventing floods. Most of the large and small flood control projects in various places have been successfully completed before the flood season. After the completion of the Dongxi River in Xichang County, Salian Township in Miyi County, and the Shizigou, Dagan Gou, and Xiaogan Gou in Hanyuan County, flood control agencies were established in a timely manner, and rescue teams were organized to prepare some materials and tools needed for rescue, so as to carry out rescue work in a timely manner when a danger of flooding occurs.

    西康省沿江河地区农民兴修防洪工程
    西康省雅安、西昌两专区和藏族自治区、凉山彝族自治区沿江河农业地区农民，积极兴修、整修许多防洪工程。西昌、米易两县沿安宁河地区的农民，除将原有的防洪堤、坝进行了整修、加固或扩修以外，还兴修了很多条数十公尺长的防洪堤、护岸堤，筑了不少截水的水坝；芦山、雅安等县沿羌江地区的农民，在兴修、加固防洪工程、垒砌防洪埂、支水埂等防洪设备的同时，还打掉、炸碎许多矗立河中阻碍水流的大石包，或淘深、加宽河床，使水位降低，流水畅通，涨水时洪水不致猛涨上岸威胁生产。各地兴修、整修、加固了防洪工程后，抗洪能力已大大加强，一般都能起到“大水减灾，小水免灾”的作用。芦山县龙门乡的防洪工程经过加宽河床、打掉河心阻碍水流的大石头以后，水位降低，青龙场全场二百多家居民和第七、八两村的农田，不再遭受洪水的威胁了；米易县撒莲乡的防洪工程，也能保证一千多亩农田免遭洪水的危害。此外，在一般挨近山溪小河和部分高山地区或地势较为平坦、低洼，容易发生洪灾、涝灾的地区，许多农民在互助组、农业生产合作社带动下，也开挖了不少拦山堰、防洪沟、排水渠等，把洪水引入河道。宝兴县陇东乡小胜村，靠阴山居住的农民，根据阴山土地土质潮湿、保水力强，一遇下雨极容易发生涝灾的情况，在互助组带动下，一般都在地的周围或地中间挖了许多排水沟；靠阳山的农民则根据阳山坡度较大，下大雨时庄稼极容易被山洪冲坏的情况，开挖了不少拦山堰、排水沟来预防山洪暴发，有的互助组在防洪同时，还挖了水塘来蓄水防旱。各地大、小防洪工程绝大部分都已在汛期以前顺利完成，西昌县东西河、米易县撒莲乡、汉源县狮子沟、大小干沟等工程完工后，还及时建立了防洪机构，组织了抢险队，准备好了一些抢险所需用的材料和工具，以便涨水发生危险时及时进行抢救。
