    Hebei Province Supply and Marketing Cooperatives
    Exceed June Hog Procurement Target

    The Hebei Province Supply and Marketing Cooperative exceeded its June fat hog procurement target by 72.9 percent, further meeting the needs of the people of Beijing and Tianjin and guaranteeing export tasks. Among them, the number of fat hogs purchased by Cangxian Supply and Marketing Cooperative in the first half of June increased more than threefold compared with the entire month of May.

    During the procurement process, the supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions improved the methods of acceptance, weighing, and transportation, reducing the mortality and consumption of live hogs. In Nanpi County, the average consumption per hog transported to Bozhen, a distance of fifty li, was 9.57 jin, 1.43 jin lower than the original regulation. (Qi Lianzhen)

    河北省各地供销合作社
    超额完成六月份购猪任务
    河北省供销合作社超额百分之七十二点九完成六月份收购肥猪任务，进一步满足了京、津人民的需要和保证了出口任务。其中沧县供销合作社六月上半月收起的肥猪数，即比五月全月收购量增加三倍多。
    在收购过程中，各地供销合作社改进了验收、过秤和运输办法，减低了毛猪的死亡和伤耗。南皮县运往泊镇的毛猪，五十里地平均每头猪伤耗九点五七斤，比原规定低一点四三斤。（戚连振）
