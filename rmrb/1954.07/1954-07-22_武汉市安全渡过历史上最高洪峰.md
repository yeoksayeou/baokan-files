    Wuhan City safely passed the highest water level in ninety years, and continues to strengthen flood control efforts. At 8 PM on the 18th, the Yangtze River water level at the Wuhan Customs reached 28.31 meters, exceeding the highest water level in Wuhan City in 1931 by 3 centimeters, marking the highest water level recorded at Wuhan Customs in ninety years. From the 19th, the water level began to steadily recede, dropping to 28.25 meters by 8 AM on the 21st, a decrease of 6 centimeters. Currently, the Yangtze River water surface is still significantly higher than the city's ground level. Thanks to the timely completion of the embankment heightening and reinforcement projects throughout the city, the embankment surface remains more than one meter above the floodwaters, successfully withstanding the test of the high water level.
    At present, the Wuhan City Flood Control Headquarters is supervising the flood control teams, continuing their efforts, and maintaining strict defenses. When the Yangtze River flood peak arrived on the 18th, Zhang Pinghua, Secretary of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Song Kanfu, Deputy Mayor of the Wuhan Municipal People's Government, and other leaders of the Flood Control Headquarters personally inspected the embankments in the Hankou urban area. They carefully checked the completed first-phase embankment heightening and reinforcement project and approved the second-phase flood control project plans for each embankment section on the spot, further reinforcing the embankments and preparing wind and wave protection equipment. The Flood Control Headquarters also dispatched engineers to Wuchang and Hanyang on the 19th and 20th to inspect the progress and quality of flood control projects in these two areas. In recent days, work has been carried out around the clock to reinforce embankments and add wind protection equipment. Patrol and emergency rescue teams are constantly on guard along the more than 200-mile-long embankment line throughout the city. On the 21st, the Wuhan Municipal People's Representatives Conference Consultative Committee issued a call to the people of the city, further mobilizing them to actively participate in and support flood control work, urging them to continue to raise their vigilance, prevent complacency and slackness, and not only to unremittingly carry out flood control work on the embankments, but also to do a good job in production and support flood control with practical actions.

    武汉市安全渡过历史上最高洪峰
    武汉市人民安全渡过九十年来的最高水位，现在继续加强防汛斗争。十八日下午八时，武汉关的长江水位一度涨到二十八点三一公尺，超过武汉市一九三一年最高水位三公分，为武汉关有水文纪录的九十年来的最高水位。十九日起水位开始稳落，到二十一日上午八时降为二十八点二五公尺，回落了六公分。现在，长江水面仍超出市区地面很高，由于全市堤防及时完成了加高加固工程，堤面距洪水仍在一公尺以上，正胜利地经历着高水位的洪水考验。
    目前，武汉市防汛总指挥部正督率防汛大队，继续努力，严密防守。当十八日长江洪峰到来时，中共武汉市委书记张平化、武汉市人民政府副市长宋侃夫和防汛总指挥部的其他负责人，亲自巡视检查了汉口市区的堤防，对于已完成的第一期堤防加高加固工程作了认真检查，并就地批准了各堤段的第二期防汛工程计划，进一步加固堤防和作好防风防浪的设备。防汛总指挥部并派工程师在十九日、二十日先后到武昌、汉阳，检查了这两个地区的防汛工程进度和工程质量。这几天，各处都在昼夜不停地进行堤防加固和增加防风设备。全市二百多里的堤防线上，巡逻抢险队伍川流不息地警戒着。二十一日，武汉市各界人民代表会议协商委员会向全市人民发出号召，进一步动员全市人民积极参加和支援防汛工作，要求继续提高警惕性，防止松懈麻痹思想，不仅在堤防上要坚持不懈地作好防汛工作，同时也要搞好生产，用实际行动支援防汛。
