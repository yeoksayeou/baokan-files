Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, July 2nd: The Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, which has been fully operational for two years, has become a major artery in the economic life of the Southwest region. In the past two years, the volume of transport of many important materials on the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway has continued to increase. The freight volume in the second year after the opening of the railway increased by 50.5% compared to the first year; the number of passengers increased by 15%.

The Chengdu-Chongqing Railway is connected to the waterway of the Yangtze River in Chongqing. Many industrial equipment, drilling equipment, agricultural machinery, chemical fertilizers, and locomotives, vehicles, and automobiles supporting the Baoji-Chengdu Railway and the Kangzang Highway from all over the country, the Soviet Union, and Eastern European People's Democratic countries are unloaded in Chongqing and transferred via the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway. In the past two years, the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway has transported a large number of heavy machinery for Chongqing Power Plant, the largest new construction in the Southwest, and a large number of drilling equipment for the Sichuan oil exploration area. The Chengdu-Chongqing Railway connects with the Sichuan-Shaanxi and Sichuan-Kangding highways in Chengdu. In the past two years, more than 39,000 tons of local and special products from western Sichuan and Xikang have been sent from Chengdu Station, providing a broad market for medicinal materials, tobacco leaves, hemp, etc., which had been unsalable for a long time due to inconvenient transportation and high freight rates. The Chengdu-Chongqing Railway runs through areas rich in rice and sugarcane, and is connected to the famous well salt producing area of ​​Zigong City by highways. In the past two years, 470,000 tons of grain, edible salt, and sugar have been transported via the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway. Since the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway and the Qijiang Railway implemented joint transportation last April, the amount of edible salt transported to Guizhou has greatly increased, and the price of salt in the Guizhou area has therefore decreased by 34%. The coal from Nanton, Donglin and other coal mines has also begun to supply the needs of sugar boiling in Neijiang and other places. This April, the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway and the Baoji-Chengdu Railway also held joint transportation, and Nanton coal was sold as far as Chengdu and Mianyang.

With the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway as the center, the transportation network is expanding more and more, and the impact of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway on the economic life of the people along the line is also becoming more profound. Taking the Neijiang area in the middle section of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway as an example, since the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, the industrial and agricultural production of this area has developed relatively quickly. Compared with 1953 and 1950, the output of sugar increased by 122%, the output of sugarcane increased by 144%, the output of coal increased by 329%, and the output of cotton increased by 235%. With the improvement of production, people's living standards have also improved. The average per capita consumption of refined grains in this area in 1953 increased by 45% compared to 1952, pork increased by 31.7%, and cloth increased by 28%.

In order to adapt to the increasingly heavy transportation tasks, the various equipment of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway has been continuously expanded and improved in the past two years, and the number of employees has also increased by more than 45%. In terms of the improvement of technical equipment, all the employees have also contributed a lot. Li Quanshui, a worker at the Jiulongpo Locomotive Depot, has created and improved a total of 33 tools in the past two years, changing a brake repair room from manual operation to mechanical operation. Last year, the vehicle department promoted the advanced experience of the former China Changchun Railway and the Soviet Union, reducing the direct man-hours for repairing each vehicle from 45 hours to 15 hours. After the D渡口 (D渡口 - not sure how to translate this) Station improved the method of loading steel rails, it saved a total of 920 wagons from August last year to May this year, saving the country more than 2.3 billion yuan in freight.

Due to the development of industrial and agricultural production along the line, the freight volume of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway is becoming more and more heavy, and this year's peak freight season arrived about a month earlier than in previous years. By adopting methods such as allocating vehicles in groups, loading vehicles in groups, carrying out non-detachment operations in a planned manner, and adding vehicles to passenger-cargo mixed trains to accelerate vehicle turnover, transportation efficiency has been further improved. In June, the transportation task was overfulfilled by more than 20,000 tons, and the semi-annual freight task was overfulfilled by 3.7%. While the employees worked hard to complete the transportation tasks, the transportation cost of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway also decreased. This year's planned cost is 22.7% lower than the actual cost in 1953, and the cost plan has been completed from January to May this year.

【Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, July 2nd】Since the opening of the Chengdu-Zhongba section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, it has shown its role in supporting industrial construction and enlivening the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas.

In April and May of this year, an oil exploration area in Sichuan Province transported hundreds of tons of equipment and materials through this open line. Among them, boilers and other heavy equipment are very difficult to transport by automobile. The Baoji-Chengdu Railway undertook the transportation of these equipments, which enabled the new exploration wells in this oil exploration area to be drilled in mid-June ahead of schedule. After many local industries and handicrafts along the Chengdu-Zhongba line obtained cheap raw materials transported by train, production costs were reduced. Most of the coal needed by many factories in the Mianyang area used to be transported by wooden boats from the lower reaches of the Fujiang and Jialing rivers, which was expensive in freight and high in coal prices. After switching to railway transportation, the price of coal in Mianyang quickly dropped by 50%. Due to the reduction in coal prices, the cost of each catty of ironware in the Mianyang 工农铁具工厂 (工农铁具工厂 - Worker-Peasant Iron Tool Factory) has been reduced by an average of 700 to 800 yuan, and the price of agricultural tools produced by the ironware handicraft industry in Mianyang has also been reduced by 10%.

The Chengdu-Zhongba line is rich in rice, wheat, rapeseed, tobacco leaves, etc., and Zhongba is a distribution center for medicinal materials in northwestern Sichuan. The opening of this railway has greatly promoted the exchange of materials along the line. In the first quarter of this year alone, the number of minor local products sold outside Mianzhu County increased from 13 to 23 last year. The train also quickly transported a large number of industrial products to the vast rural areas along the line. In the first quarter of this year, the Sichuan Provincial Cooperative Federation Preparatory Committee transported 2,000 tons of chemical fertilizers in a timely manner through railway transportation to supply the needs of spring plowing for farmers in northwestern Sichuan. In the past, farmers in Mianyang County could only exchange 100 catties of chemical fertilizer for 350 catties of rice, but now, due to the reduction in freight rates, they can exchange for 120 catties. After Mianyang, Jiangyou, Jiange and other places obtained a large amount of well salt from Zigong City transported by train, the price of each dan of salt also dropped by 17,000 yuan to 20,000 yuan.

    成渝铁路成为西南经济大动脉
    宝成路成都中坝段通车后促进了物资交流
    据新华社重庆二日电：全线通车两周年的成渝铁路，已经成为西南地区经济生活中的大动脉。两年来成渝铁路许多重要物资的运输量不断增加，通车后第二个年头的货运量比第一个年头增加了百分之五十点五；客运人数增加了百分之十五。
    成渝铁路在重庆和长江的航道相联，许多来自全国各地、苏联和东欧人民民主国家的工业设备、钻探器材、农业机械、化学肥料以及支援宝成铁路和康藏公路的机车、车辆、汽车，都在重庆上岸，经由成渝铁路转运。两年来成渝铁路为西南最大的新建重庆电力厂运输了大批重型机器，为四川石油探区运输了大批的钻探器材。成渝铁路在成都和川陕、川康公路相接。两年来自成都车站发送的川西和西康的土产、特产就有三万九千多吨，使过去因为交通不便、运价太高而长期滞销的药材、烟叶、大麻等，找到了广阔的销路。成渝铁路沿线有盛产大米的和盛产蔗糖的地区，并有公路和我国著名井盐产地——自贡市相通。两年来经由成渝铁路运输的粮食、食盐和蔗糖便有四十七万吨。自从去年四月成渝铁路和綦江铁路实行联运后，运往贵州的食盐数量大大增加，贵州地区的盐价因此降低了百分之三十四，南桐、东林等煤矿的煤也开始供应内江等地熬糖的需要。今年四月成渝铁路和宝成铁路也举办了联运，南桐的煤更远销到成都、绵阳一带。
    以成渝铁路为中心的交通运输网愈来愈扩大，成渝铁路对沿线人民的经济生活的影响，也更加深刻了。以成渝铁路中段的内江专区为例，自从修筑成渝铁路以来，这个专区的工农业生产发展都比较快。以一九五三年和一九五零年相比，糖的产量增加了百分之一百二十二，甘蔗的产量增加了百分之一百四十四，煤的产量增加了百分之三百二十九，棉花的产量增加了百分之二百三十五。生产提高后，人民生活也随着改善。这个专区平均每人消费的细粮一九五三年比一九五二年增加了百分之四十五，猪肉增加了百分之三十一点七，布匹增加了百分之二十八。
    适应着日趋繁重的运输任务，成渝铁路的各项设备两年来也不断地得到了扩充和改善，职工人数也增加了百分之四十五以上。在技术设备的改进方面，全线职工也贡献出了很大的力量。九龙坡机务段工人李泉水，两年多来一共创造和改进了三十三件工具，把一个制动器检修室由手工操作改变成为机械操作。车辆部门去年推行了原中长铁路和苏联的先进经验，使每辆车的检修直接工时由四十五小时降低到十五小时。大渡口车站改进了钢轨的装车法以后，从去年八月到今年五月共节省九百二十个车皮，为国家节约了二十三亿元以上的运费。
    由于沿线工农业生产的发展，成渝铁路的货运愈来愈繁重，今年的货运旺季约比往年提早了一个月到来。由于采取了成组拨车、成组装车、有计划地进行不摘车作业、客货混合列车加挂车辆等加速车辆周转的办法，运输效率得到进一步提高，六月份超额两万多吨完成了运输任务，而且超额百分之三点七完成上半年货运任务。在职工们努力完成运输任务的同时，成渝铁路的运输成本也降低了。今年的计划成本比一九五三年的实际成本降低百分之二十二点七，今年一月到五月都完成了成本计划。
     【新华社成都二日电】宝成铁路成都到中坝段通车以来，已经显示出了在支援工业建设和活跃城乡物资交流中的作用。
    四川省的一个石油探区，今年四、五月份就由这条通车线路运到几百吨器材物资。其中像锅炉和其他重型器材，如果用汽车运输都是很困难的。宝成铁路担负起这些器材的运输，就使得这个石油探区的新探井能提前在六月中旬开钻。成都到中坝沿线的许多地方工业和手工业得到火车运来的廉价原料后，生产成本有了降低。绵阳专区许多工厂需用的煤，过去大部分由涪江、嘉陵江下游用木船运来，运费贵，煤价高；改由铁路运输后，绵阳煤价很快就降低了百分之五十。由于煤价降低，绵阳工农铁具工厂每斤铁器的成本平均降低了七、八百元，绵阳的铁器手工业出产的农具价格也降低了百分之十。
    成都到中坝沿线盛产稻米、小麦、菜籽、烟叶等，中坝又是川西北药材集散地。这段铁路通车就大大促进了沿线的物资交流。今年第一季度仅绵竹一县外销的小宗土产就由去年的十三种增加到二十三种。火车还将大量的工业品迅速地运到沿线广大农村。四川省合作社联合社筹备委员会今年第一季度就把二千吨化学肥料，及时通过铁路运输供应了川西北农民春耕的需要。以前绵阳县农民用三百五十斤大米只能换到一百斤化学肥料，现在由于运价降低，已能换到一百二十斤。绵阳、江油、剑阁等地得到火车运来的大量自贡市井盐后，每担盐的价格也降低了一万七千元到两万元。
