    For the Children
    Su Huilian, Weaving Worker, Shaanxi No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory
    When the draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China was published, I had just given birth to my fourth child. When I learned the content of the draft Constitution, I was indescribably happy. Not just for myself, but for the children, I will also warmly support the draft Constitution.
    I am a reed worker at the Shaanxi No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory, a joint state-private enterprise. I am twenty-eight years old this year and have been working in the yarn factory since I was eight years old. Before liberation, the suffering was endless. Take the birth of my first child, for example; I will never forget it. I got married at twenty, and soon, I was pregnant with my first child. Logically, this should have been a happy event, but at the time, it felt like a heavy stone was weighing me down. Because from the age of eight, I had seen countless sisters in the factory who were doing well, but were fired by the capitalists after they got married and pregnant. In order to avoid being fired because of pregnancy, I endured all kinds of pain and tried to conceal it. When I was one or two months pregnant, I was afraid that eating and throwing up too much would be noticed by the workshop director, so I ate only one meal a day at most, sometimes not even a bite for a day or two. After a few days, I was so hungry that I was dizzy. Once, my legs were so weak that it felt like the bones had been removed, and I couldn't hold on any longer. I had to pluck up my courage and ask the workshop director for leave. The workshop director put on a fierce face and said to me, "It doesn't matter, if you die, I'll pay with my life!" I was afraid of being fired if I said too much, so I had to grit my teeth and swallow the tears in my stomach, continuing to work twelve hours a day. After being five or six months pregnant, I disregarded the danger to the fetus and tried to tie my stomach tightly, covering it with a large piece of clothing, pretending that I was not pregnant. It was not easy to conceal the birth of my first child. Who knew that after the child was born, because there was no milk to eat and no one to take good care of it, it fell ill every two or three days. Soon, I was finally fired by the capitalists for asking for leave twice to take my child to the doctor. From then on, our family of three depended on my husband alone. The following year, I gave birth to my second child, and as a result, the family became even more short of food and clothing. My husband and I used to have a very good relationship, but later, because of the difficulties at home, everyone was unhappy, and we often quarreled. I often hated myself for why I got married and had children.
    In the spring of the second year after liberation, because I was a skilled worker, the factory rehired me. Less than two months after returning to the factory, I became pregnant with my third child. At this time, my husband and I became worried again: Before liberation, capitalists would fire those who were pregnant, who knew what would happen after liberation? Just then, the factory began labor insurance card registration. From this, I learned that under the leadership of the People's Government, pregnant female workers would not only not be fired, but also be protected. This resolved the knot in my heart. When I gave birth to my third child, I rested for fifty-six days before and after childbirth, and I still received my salary. As soon as the vacation was over, I sent the child to the nursing room, which did not affect my work at all.
    After giving birth to my third child, my enthusiasm for production was particularly great. I thought all the time that the Communist Party and the People's Government cherish the working people so much, I must use all my skills and energy to do a good job in production and repay the Party and the People's Government. In 1951, I and the workers in our workshop jointly created a new method of weaving reeds, which generally increased production efficiency by about 30%. In 1952, I was elected as a labor model in the Northwest region, and in the same year, I joined the Communist Party of China, which is the greatest honor of my life!
    When I gave birth to my fourth child, the conditions in all aspects were even better than before. Three months before childbirth, the factory adjusted my work to lighter work in accordance with the labor insurance regulations, and I also received good nutrition after childbirth. My two children have also been sent to the factory's nursery, and they are growing up very well. I truly feel the happiness of being a mother. The draft Constitution stipulates that "marriage, family, mothers and children are protected by the state." The People's Government has already done all of this, and my children and I have personally received this protection. In the future, my husband and I will definitely improve our production technology, actively participate in the technical innovation movement, study hard, improve our political consciousness; and we must raise our children well so that they can all become good citizens who love labor.

    为了孩子们
    陕西第一棉纺织厂穿筘工人　苏惠莲
    中华人民共和国宪法草案公布时，我正生了第四个孩子。当我知道了宪法草案的内容后，我真是说不出地高兴。不光只为了我自己，为了孩子们，我也要热烈拥护宪法草案。
    我是公私合营陕西第一棉纺织厂的穿筘工人，今年二十八岁，从八岁就在纱厂做工。在解放前，受的苦真是说不完的。就拿我生第一个孩子的事情来说吧，也叫我一辈子忘不了。我是二十岁结婚的，不久，就怀上了第一个孩子。照理说，这应该是一件喜事，但当时在我身上却像压了一块大石头一样沉重。因为从八岁起，我在工厂里就不知看到过多少姊妹原来干得好好的，结婚怀孕后，就被资本家开除了。我为了怕因怀孕而被开除，就忍受着各种痛苦，想法遮掩这件事。怀孕一两个月时，我怕吃得多吐得多，被车间主任发觉，每天最多吃一顿饭，有时甚至一两天也不吃一点饭。几天以后，饿得头昏眼花。有一次，两条腿软得像抽掉了骨头，实在支持不住了，我只好鼓着勇气向车间主任去请假。车间主任摆着一付恶狠狠的面孔对我说：“没关系，死了我偿你的命！”我怕话讲多了被开除，只得咬紧牙关把泪水咽到肚里，继续每天干十二小时的活。怀孕五六个月后，我顾不得胎儿的危险，想法把肚子箍得紧紧的，外面罩上一件宽大的衣裳，装着像没怀孕一样。好容易这样遮遮掩掩地把第一个孩子生下来了。谁知孩子生下来后，因为没有奶吃，又没有人很好地照顾，三天两头害病。不久，我终于因为给孩子看病请过两次假被资本家开除了。从此以后，我们一家大小三口，就靠我丈夫一人养活了。第二年，我又生下第二个孩子，这样一来，家里越发缺吃少用。我和丈夫原来感情很好，后来因家里困难，大家心里不痛快，常常发生争吵。我常恨自己为啥要结婚、生孩子呢？
    解放后的第二年春天，因为我是熟练工人，厂里又把我吸收回厂了。回工厂不到两个月，我又怀上了第三个孩子，这时我和我的丈夫又担心起来：解放前资本家对怀了孩子的要开除，解放后谁知道会怎样呢？正在这时，工厂开始了劳动保险卡片登记，我从这中间知道了在人民政府的领导下，怀了孕的女工不仅不会被开除，而且还要受到保护，这一下可把我心里的疙瘩解开了。我生第三个孩子时，产前产后休息了五十六天，并且照样拿工资。假期一满，我就把孩子送到哺乳室，一点也没牵累工作。
    生了第三个孩子后，我的生产劲头特别大了。我时时刻刻想到共产党、人民政府这样爱护劳动人民，我一定要把全部技术和劲头拿出来搞好生产，报答党和人民政府。一九五一年，我和我们车间的工人共同创造了新的穿筘工作法，使生产效率普遍提高了百分之三十左右。一九五二年，我被选为西北区的劳动模范，并且在同年参加了中国共产党，这是我一辈子最大的光荣！
    在我生第四个孩子的时候，各方面的条件比以前更好了。产前三个月，厂里就按照劳动保险条例调我做轻活，产后也得到很好的营养。我的两个孩子，也已经送到工厂举办的托儿所，都长得很好。我真正感到了做母亲的幸福。宪法草案上规定的“婚姻、家庭、母亲和儿童受国家的保护”，人民政府早已都做到了，我和我的孩子都亲身受到了这些保护。今后，我和我丈夫一定要更好地提高生产技术，积极参加技术革新运动，努力学习，提高政治觉悟；并且要好好地抚养孩子，使他们都能成为很好的热爱劳动的公民。
