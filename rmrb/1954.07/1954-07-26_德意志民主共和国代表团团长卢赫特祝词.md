Comrade Loebert, head of the delegation of the German Democratic Republic, extended greetings to the First Congress of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives. He said:

    Please allow me to convey the fraternal greetings of the 2.9 million members of the consumer cooperatives and 6 million collective farmers of the German Democratic Republic to the First Congress of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives and to the 164 million cooperative members!

    He said, wishing our Chinese friends further great achievements in realizing the general line of the country's transition period and in the struggle to defend peace.

    After describing the German people's deep desire to unify their fatherland, he said that since the beginning of the year, 140 West German cooperative delegations have visited the consumer cooperatives of the German Democratic Republic; in the consumer cooperatives of the German Democratic Republic there are more than 5,000 groups corresponding with friends in West German cooperatives.

    He said: Based on the peace negotiation policy of the German Democratic Republic, under the initiative of the consumer cooperatives of the German Democratic Republic, the exchange of goods began between the central organs of consumer cooperatives in East and West Germany, and we have also suggested that 2,500 children of impoverished cooperative members from West Germany come to the German Democratic Republic to spend their holidays free of charge.

    He said that with the German Democratic Republic government's many measures aimed at continuously improving the people's living standards, the retail sales of consumer cooperatives have rapidly increased. The consumer cooperatives of the German Democratic Republic are striving to fulfill their tasks, to contribute to the continuous strengthening of the German Democratic Republic, to the continuous improvement of the people's living standards, thereby providing a great example of peaceful development for the whole of Germany, and finally striving to establish a unified, peace-loving, democratic and independent Germany.

    德意志民主共和国合作社代表团团长卢赫特向中华全国合作社第一次代表大会致祝词，他说：
    请允许我向中华全国合作社第一次代表大会以及向一亿六千四百多万合作社社员转达德意志民主共和国二百九十万名消费合作社社员和六百万集体农民的兄弟般的敬礼！
    他说，祝我们的中国朋友们在实现国家过渡时期总路线、以及在捍卫和平的斗争中获得进一步的伟大成就。

    他说：根据德意志民主共和国的和平协商政策，在德意志民主共和国消费合作社的创议之下，东西德消费合作社中央机关之间开始了货物交换，并且我们也曾建议，让二千五百名西德贫困的合作社社员子女到德意志民主共和国来免费渡过他们的假期。
    他说，随着德意志民主共和国政府的许多旨在不断提高人民生活水平的措施，消费合作社的零售额迅速地增加了。德意志民主共和国消费合作社全力争取完成它们的任务，为了贡献出一份力量，使德意志民主共和国不断强大起来，使人民的生活水平不断地提高，从而为全德国提供一个和平发展的伟大榜样，并最后争取建立成一个统一、爱好和平、民主和独立的德国。
