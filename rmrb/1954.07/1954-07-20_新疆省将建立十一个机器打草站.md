Xinjiang Province will focus on establishing eleven machine hay stations this summer to harvest pasture grass by machine. The locations for the hay stations have been determined to be in the Ili, Tacheng, and Urumqi regions, where livestock production conditions are good and transportation is relatively convenient. The task of the hay stations is currently focused on cutting grass themselves, while also renting out some hay mowers for farmers who lack tools to cut grass. The grass cut by the hay stations themselves is mainly to supply the needs of farmers who are unable to cut grass, and a portion will be stored to prevent various natural disasters. The eleven machine hay stations will be equipped with thirty horse-drawn hay mowers, each hay mower staffed with five people for management and five horses for power. These horse-drawn hay mowers were recently imported from the Soviet Union, and each hay mower can harvest 9,000 kilograms of pasture grass (green grass) per day. Calculating based on a hay cutting season of forty days per year, each machine can cut 360,000 kilograms of grass per season. In order to make the pasture grass easy to store and maintain nutrients, the grass harvested by the hay stations will also be scientifically processed, providing demonstration education to the broad masses of farmers to promote scientific feeding management.

In addition, the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government Animal Husbandry Department plans to focus on lending fifty horse-drawn hay mowers in the Ili, Tacheng, and Altay regions this summer. The lending targets are mainly state-owned farms and pastures, followed by organized farmers engaged in production.

    新疆省将建立十一个机器打草站
    新疆省在今年夏季，将重点建立十一个机器打草站，以机器收割牧草。打草站建立地点确定在牧业生产条件较好和交通比较便利的伊犁、塔城、乌鲁木齐三个专区。打草站的任务，当前是以自割牧草为主，同时出租一部分打草机，为缺乏工具的牧民割牧草。打草站自割的牧草，主要是为了供给无力打草的牧民的需要，一部分将储存起来，以预防各种自然灾害。十一个机器打草站，将配备马拉打草机三十架，每架打草机配备五个人管理和五匹马的畜力。这种马拉打草机是最近由苏联进口的，每架打草机每天能收割牧草（青草）九千公斤，以每年打草季节四十天的时间计算，每架一季能打草三十六万公斤。为了使牧草便于储存和保持养分，打草站收割的牧草，还准备进行科学调制，给广大牧民群众以示范教育，以便推广科学的饲养管理。
    另外，新疆省人民政府畜牧厅计划于今年夏季在伊犁、塔城、阿勒泰三个专区，重点贷放五十架马拉打草机。贷放对象以国营农场、牧场为主，其次是组织起来生产的牧民。
