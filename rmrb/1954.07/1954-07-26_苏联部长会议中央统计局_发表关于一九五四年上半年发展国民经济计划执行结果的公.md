The Central Statistical Bureau of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union issued a communiqué on the results of the implementation of the National Economic Development Plan for the first half of 1954, stating:

In the first half of 1954, the overall industrial production plan was fulfilled by 102 percent. The total industrial output for the first six months of this year increased by 14 percent compared to the same period last year. Heavy industry has further developed, and the production of consumer goods has continuously increased.

The production plans for the first six months were overfulfilled for: coal, petroleum, natural gas, and other fuels; steel, steel pipes, various metals; electricity; mainline locomotives, freight cars, and buses; excavators; tractor-drawn bulldozers; metal-cutting machine tools; tractors; potato square-hole planters; sugar beet combines; grain cleaners; potato combines; cement; paper; and many other industrial products.

In the first half of 1954, the production of cotton fabrics, linen fabrics, woolen fabrics, and silk fabrics, radio receivers, clocks and watches, upright pianos and grand pianos, confectionery, tea, wine, soap, and other food and industrial products exceeded the plan.

The communiqué pointed out that although industry as a whole overfulfilled the plan for the first half of 1954, there were still some production items that did not fulfill the plan.

In the first half of 1954, the Soviet industrial production of pig iron increased by 6 percent compared to the same period last year; steel, by 9 percent; steel products, by 9 percent; coal, by 8 percent; petroleum, by 10 percent; diesel fuel, by 40 percent; electricity, by 11 percent; steam turbines, by 12 percent; giant hydraulic turbines, by 104 percent; hydroelectric generators, by 34 percent; giant electrical machines, by 15 percent; mainline locomotives, by 31 percent; freight cars, by 10 percent; passenger cars, by 27 percent; metallurgical equipment, by 8 percent; excavators, by 17 percent; giant, heavy, and universal machine tools, by 22 percent; spinning machines, by 14 percent; weaving machines, by 42 percent; tractors, by 19 percent; cotton harvesters, by 37 percent; sugar beet combines, by 101 percent; mineral fertilizers, by 11 percent; linen fabrics, by 10 percent; woolen fabrics, by 19 percent; silk fabrics, by 57 percent; leather shoes, by 10 percent; knitted garments, by 12 percent; radio receivers, by 107 percent; television sets, by 188 percent; clocks and watches, by 29 percent; refrigerators, by 216 percent; vacuum cleaners, by 349 percent; furniture, by 28 percent; meat and sausage products, by 2 percent; fish, by 13 percent; dairy products, by 10 percent.

In the first six months of 1954, the production of daily necessities and household goods by heavy industrial enterprises greatly increased. Light industrial and food industrial enterprises produced more and more marketable goods of improved quality. For example, the production of woolen fabrics increased by 19 percent, pure wool fabrics increased by 2.2 times, fine wool fabrics increased by 3.5 times, shoes increased by 10 percent, and fashionable shoes increased by 19 percent.

The Central Statistical Bureau's report also listed figures to demonstrate the development of Soviet agriculture. Collective farms, machine tractor stations, and state farms successfully carried out spring sowing. The spring sowing plan for crops was overfulfilled. In 1954, the sown area of spring crops increased by 9.5 million hectares compared to last year. The sown area of spring grain crops expanded by 6.4 million hectares, including 3.6 million hectares of spring wheat and 756,000 hectares of corn for food. The sown area of cotton expanded by 354,000 hectares.

In 1954-1955, the collective farms and state farms in the regions of Kazakhstan, Siberia, the Urals, the Volga River Basin, and the North Caucasus will reclaim 13 million hectares of virgin and fallow land in order to expand the sown area of grain. By July 10, 1954, approximately 10 million hectares of virgin and fallow land had been reclaimed for this year's and next year's harvests. According to the state plan, in the spring of 1954, collective farms and state farms had to sow grain on 2.3 million hectares of virgin and fallow land; in fact, 3.6 million hectares of newly reclaimed land had been sown with grain.

This year, the area sown with spring crops on autumn-plowed land increased by 13 million hectares compared to 1953. A large proportion of potatoes, corn, sunflowers, and other cultivated crops are sown or planted using the square-hole planting method or the square planting method.

In the first six months of 1954, agriculture received another 92,000 tractors (each calculated at 15 horsepower), 52,000 trucks, 18,000 grain harvesting combines, 15,000 tractor-drawn and self-propelled hay harvesting machines, and more than 5,000 potato combines, which began mass production this year, and many other agricultural machines.

In the first six months of this year, 65,000 tractors (each calculated at 15 horsepower), more than 9,000 grain harvesting combines, and more than 6,000 trucks have been transported to areas reclaiming virgin and fallow land.

Due to the increasing supply of agricultural machinery, it is possible to mechanize the sowing and cultivation work of spring crops on a larger scale. This year, 86 percent of the sowing work of spring crops on collective farms has been mechanized; the mechanization level of potato planting on collective farms has reached 40 percent.

The agricultural work done by machine tractor stations for collective farms, converted into plowing, increased by 26 million hectares compared to the same period last year.

The increase in the number of publicly owned livestock on collective farms from July 1, 1953, to July 1, 1954, is as follows: dairy cows, 10 percent; pigs, 5 percent.

The total number of livestock privately owned by collective farmers and factory workers has greatly increased. From July 1, 1953, to July 1, 1954, the number of dairy cows privately owned by collective farmers increased by 7 percent; calves, 15 percent; pigs, 26 percent; sheep, 35 percent.

According to preliminary materials, from July 1, 1953, to July 1, 1954, the total number of livestock in the Soviet Union increased as follows: dairy cows, 8 percent; pigs, 13 percent; sheep, 4 percent.

The part of the communiqué concerning transportation pointed out that in the first half of 1954, the daily vehicle loading plan for railway transportation was fulfilled by 101 percent, and calculated by tonnage, it was fulfilled by 99.7 percent.

The daily volume of railway transportation of various goods increased by 6 percent compared to the first half of 1953.

Although the volume of maritime and inland waterway freight did not fully complete the plan, it increased by 4 percent compared to the first six months of 1953.

The highway freight plan was fulfilled by 103 percent.

The Central Statistical Bureau's communiqué then listed figures to illustrate the increase in Soviet capital construction volume.

The total amount of state capital investment was 114 percent of the same period last year. During the period mentioned in the communiqué, capital investment in housing construction increased by 20 percent.

In the first half of 1954, Soviet trade continued to expand. On April 1, 1954, the government once again implemented a reduction in state retail prices for food and manufactured goods. This was the seventh price reduction since the war. This new price reduction further consolidated the Soviet ruble and improved the people's living standards.

The retail sales volume of state and cooperative trade organizations in the first half of 1954 increased by 21 percent compared to the same period last year (calculated at comparable prices); at the same time, the retail trade volume of rural cooperatives increased by 32 percent. The retail trade volume plan of state and cooperative trade organizations for the first six months of 1954 has been overfulfilled. The sales volume of meat products increased by 30 percent; fish products, 24 percent; butter, 28 percent; vegetable oil and other edible oils, 13 percent; milk and dairy products, 21 percent; sugar, 14 percent....

In terms of manufactured goods, the sales volume of the following items increased significantly: cotton fabrics, 19 percent; silk fabrics, 45 percent; woolen fabrics, 56 percent; clothing, 24 percent; leather shoes, 15 percent; furniture, 37 percent; vacuum cleaners, more than quadrupled; television sets, more than doubled; radio receivers, more than doubled....

In terms of foreign trade, during the period mentioned in the communiqué, the economic relations between the Soviet Union and other countries continued to develop; the total volume of foreign trade increased by 30 percent compared to the first half of 1953.

The report then listed figures on the increase in the number of employees in the Soviet national economy. In the first half of 1954, the total number of employees in industry, construction, and transportation increased by 1.2 million compared to the same period last year.

Due to the incorporation of tractor team workers into the fixed and seasonal workers of machine tractor stations, and due to the increase in the number of workers and experts in areas reclaiming virgin and fallow land, the total number of workers and other staff members in machine tractor stations and state farms increased by 2.3 million.

In the first half of 1954, labor productivity in industry increased by 7.5 percent compared to the same period last year, and in construction, it increased by 7 percent; however, the plan to increase labor productivity in industry and construction was not fulfilled.

A section of the report discussed cultural development and public health services.

This year, the number of students graduating from seven-year schools and secondary schools (including schools for young workers and agricultural workers) increased by 14 percent compared to last year.

The number of students who completed the tenth grade and received graduation diplomas increased by 69 percent in cities and 82 percent in rural areas.

This year, more than 550,000 young experts will graduate from higher education institutions and technical colleges (including correspondence departments).

During the period mentioned in the communiqué, medical services (as everyone knows, medical care is free in the Soviet Union) were continuously improved and expanded. The distribution network of hospitals, maternity hospitals, sanatoriums, and rest homes has been expanded. They have been supplied with new medical equipment and diagnostic tools. In the first half of 1954, the production of medicines, medical equipment, and medical supplies increased by 23 percent compared to the same period last year.

In the first half of this year, approximately 22.2 million people took vacations, and all workers and staff members have this type of vacation with pay every year.

The number of working people vacationing in sanatoriums or rest homes at no cost or low cost has increased.

The Central Statistical Bureau's communiqué concluded by saying: The results of the implementation of the plan in the first half of 1954 demonstrate the further development of the entire Soviet national economy and progress in completing the tasks of the 1951-1955 Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy.

    苏联部长会议中央统计局
    发表关于一九五四年上半年发展国民经济计划执行结果的公报
    苏联部长会议中央统计局发表关于一九五四年上半年发展国民经济计划执行结果的公报说：
    一九五四年上半年，工业总生产计划整个说来完成了百分之一百零二。今年头六个月的工业总产量比去年同一时期增加了百分之十四。重工业有了进一步的发展，日用品生产不断地增加了。
    超额完成头六个月的生产计划的有：煤、石油、天然煤气和其他一些燃料、钢材、钢管、各种金属、电力、干线机车、货车和公共汽车、挖掘机、拖拉机牵引的推土机、金属切削工作母机、拖拉机、马铃薯正方穴播机、甜菜联合机、清谷机、马铃薯联合机、水泥、纸张以及其他许多工业产品。
    在一九五四年上半年，棉织品、麻织品、毛织品和丝织品、无线电收音机、钟表、立式钢琴和大钢琴、糖果点心、茶、酒、肥皂以及其他食品和工业品的生产都超过了计划。
    公报指出，虽然工业整个说来超额完成了一九五四年上半年的计划，然而还有某些生产项目没有完成计划。
    在一九五四年上半年，苏联工业生产的铣铁比去年同一时期增加了百分之六；钢，百分之九；钢材，百分之九；煤，百分之八；石油，百分之十；柴油，百分之四十；电力，百分之十一；汽轮机，百分之十二；巨型水轮机，百分之一百零四；水力发电机，百分之三十四；巨型电力机器，百分之十五；干线机车，百分之三十一；货车，百分之十；轻便汽车，百分之二十七；冶金设备，百分之八；挖掘机，百分之十七；巨型、重型和万能工作母机，百分之二十二；纺纱机，百分之十四；织布机，百分之四十二；拖拉机，百分之十九；摘棉机，百分之三十七；甜菜联合机，百分之一百零一；矿质肥料，百分之十一；麻织品，百分之十；毛织品，百分之十九；丝织品，百分之五十七；皮鞋，百分之十；针织服装，百分之十二；无线电收音机，百分之一百零七；电视机，百分之一百八十八；钟表，百分之二十九；冷藏器，百分之二百一十六；真空吸尘器，百分之三百四十九；家具，百分之二十八；肉类和香肠产品，百分之二；鱼类，百分之十三；奶类产品，百分之十。
    在一九五四年的头六个月中，重工业企业的日用品和家庭用具的生产量大大增加了。轻工业和食品工业企业生产了更多的质量改进了的、销路很广的商品。例如，毛织品的生产量增加了百分之十九，纯羊毛织品生产量增为二点二倍，细毛织品的产量增为三点五倍，鞋类的产量增加了百分之十，时式的鞋类的产量增加了百分之十九。
    中央统计局的报告还列举数字来证明苏联农业的发展。集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场胜利地进行了春播工作。春播作物的播种计划超额完成了。在一九五四年，春播作物的播种面积比去年增加了九百五十万公顷。春播谷物的播种面积扩大了六百四十万公顷，其中春小麦扩大了三百六十万公顷，食用玉蜀黍扩大了七十五万六千公顷。棉花的播种面积扩大了三十五万四千公顷。
    在一九五四—一九五五年，哈萨克、西伯利亚、乌拉尔、伏尔加河流域和北高加索各区的集体农庄和国营农场将开垦一千三百万公顷生荒地和熟荒地，以便扩大谷物的播种面积。到一九五四年七月十日为止，已为今年和明年的收获开垦了约一千万公顷的生荒地和熟荒地。根据国家计划，在一九五四年的春天，集体农庄和国营农场必须在二百三十万公顷生荒地和熟荒地上播种谷物；事实上有三百六十万公顷的新开垦的土地已播种了谷物。
    今年，在秋耕地上播种的春播作物的面积比一九五三年增加了一千三百万公顷。很大一部分马铃薯、玉蜀黍、向日葵和其他中耕作物是用正方穴播法或正方栽种法播种或栽种的。
    在一九五四年头六个月中，农业又得到了九万二千台拖拉机（每台以十五匹马力计算），五万二千部卡车、一万八千台谷物收割联合机，一万五千台拖拉机牵引的和自动推进干草收割机，以及五千多台今年开始大规模生产的马铃薯联合机和其他许多农业机器。
    在今年头六个月中，已将六万五千台拖拉机
  （每台以十五匹马力计算）、九千多台谷物收割联合机和六千多部卡车运往开垦生荒地和熟荒地的地区。
    由于农业机器的供应日益增加，就有可能在更大的规模上使春播作物的播种和中耕工作机械化。今年，集体农庄春播作物的播种工作已有百分之八十六机械化；集体农庄栽种马铃薯的工作的机械化程度达到百分之四十。
    机器拖拉机站为集体农庄作的农业工作，折合成犁地计算，比去年同一时期增加了二千六百万公顷。
    在一九五三年七月一日到一九五四年七月一日期间，集体农庄公有牲畜的头数增加的情形如下：乳牛，百分之十；猪，百分之五。
    集体农民和工厂职工私人所有的牲畜总头数大大增加了。在一九五三年七月一日到一九五四年七月一日期间，集体农民私人所有的乳牛的头数增加了百分之七，牛犊，百分之十五；猪，百分之二十六；绵羊，百分之三十五。
    根据初步材料，在一九五三年七月一日到一九五四年七月一日期间，苏联牲畜总头数增加如下：乳牛，百分之八；猪，百分之十三；绵羊，百分之四。
    公报关于运输的部分指出，在一九五四年上半年，铁路运输的每日车辆载运计划完成了百分之一百零一，按吨数计算完成了百分之九十九点七。
    铁路运输的各种货物的每日载运量比一九五三年上半年增加了百分之六。
    海洋和内河货运量虽然没有百分之百地完成计划，但是比一九五三年头六个月增加了百分之四。
    公路货运计划完成了百分之一百零三。
    中央统计局的公报接着列举了数字来说明苏联基本建设量的增加。
    国家基本投资总量为去年同一时期的百分之一百一十四。在公报所谈到的这段时期内，在房屋建筑方面的基本投资增加了百分之二十。
    在一九五四年上半年，苏联贸易继续扩大。一九五四年四月一日政府又一次实行减低食品和制成品的国家零售价格。这是战后第七次减低物价。这一次新的减价进一步巩固了苏联卢布，提高了人民的生活水平。
    一九五四年上半年国家和合作社贸易机关的零售额比去年同一时期增加了百分之二十一（按比较价格计算）；同时，乡村合作社的零售贸易额增加了百分之三十二。一九五四年头六个月，国家和合作社贸易机关的零售贸易额计划已超额完成。肉类产品的销售量增加了百分之三十；鱼类产品，百分之二十四；牛油，百分之二十八；植物油和其他食用油类，百分之十三；牛奶和乳制品，百分之二十一；糖类，百分之十四……。
    在制成品方面，销售量有显著的增加的物品如下：棉织品百分之十九；丝织品百分之四十五；毛织品百分之五十六；服装百分之二十四；皮鞋百分之十五；家具百分之三十七；真空吸尘器增为四倍以上；电视机二倍以上；无线电收音机二倍以上……。
    在对外贸易方面，在公报所谈到的这一段时期内，苏联和其他国家的经济关系继续发展；对外贸易总额比一九五三年上半年增加了百分之三十。
    报告接着列举了关于苏联国民经济中职工人数增加的数字。在一九五四年上半年，工业、建筑业和运输业中的职工总人数比去年同一时期增加了一百二十万。
    由于把拖拉机队的工人编入机器拖拉机站的固定的和季节性的工人之内，以及由于开垦生荒地和熟荒地的地区的工人和专家人数的增加，机器拖拉机站和国营农场的工人和其他工作人员的总人数增加了二百三十万。
    在一九五四年上半年，工业中的劳动生产率比去年同时期提高了百分之七点五，建筑业提高了百分之七；然而，提高工业和建筑业的劳动生产率的计划没有完成。
    报告有一部分谈到了文化发展和公共卫生事业。
    今年，从七年制学校和中等学校（包括为青年工人和农业工作人员设立的学校在内）毕业的学生人数比去年增加了百分之十四。
    读完十年级得到毕业文凭的学生人数在城市中增加了百分之六十九，在农村中增加了百分之八十二。
    今年，将从高等学校和技术专科学校（包括函授部门在内）毕业的青年专家将有五十五万名以上。
    在公报所谈到的时期中，医疗事业（大家知道，医疗在苏联是免费的）不断改进和扩大了。医院、产科医院、疗养院和休养所的分布网已经扩大。它们得到了新的医疗设备和诊断用具的供应。在一九五四年上半年，药品、医疗设备和医疗用具的产量比去年同期增加了百分之二十三。
    在今年上半年，约有二千二百万人度了假期，所有的工人和职员每年都有这种工资照付的假期。
    免费或低费在疗养院或休养所度假期的劳动人民的人数增加了。
    中央统计局的公报最后说：一九五四年上半年计划执行的结果，证明了整个苏联国民经济的进一步发展，证明了在完成一九五一年—一九五五年发展国民经济五年计划的任务方面的进展。
