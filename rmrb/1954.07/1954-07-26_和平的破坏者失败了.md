    Saboteurs of Peace Have Failed
    Jiang Dong
    The Geneva Conference has reached an agreement on the cessation of hostilities and restoration of peace in Indochina. Just as it happened in Korea a year ago, history will solemnly record: peace has once again triumphed over war! However, peace did not come easily. It was won by defeating the obstruction and sabotage by the United States from the beginning of the conference until the very last minute.
    Everyone knows that the United States did everything it could to sabotage the Geneva Conference. On June 4th, the Indian newspaper "The Statesman" published a dispatch from Washington stating: "Senior American policymakers, including Dulles, have never liked the Geneva Conference, and they have written it off as a predicted failure." From beginning to end, the United States treated the Geneva Conference with this attitude. When the Geneva Conference was about to begin, Dulles made a "lightning trip" to London and Paris to put pressure on Britain and France to act according to American principles. Shortly after the Geneva Conference began, Dulles, seeing that his obstruction and sabotage could not immediately take effect, decided to let his assistants and Bidault implement American policies in Geneva, while he hurried back to the United States, intending to organize joint intervention in the Indochina War and fundamentally undermine the Geneva Conference. On June 15th, the U.S. delegation refused to reach any agreement on the peaceful settlement of the Korean question, ending the discussion of the Korean question without result. At that time, the U.S. delegation intended to interrupt the discussion of the Indochina issue altogether or create an "indefinite adjournment." In late June, when foreign ministers temporarily left Geneva, Smith instructed his assistants before returning to the United States to "hold the fort," meaning to persist in the American policy of sabotage. In mid-July, when foreign ministers returned to Geneva, Dulles did not return to Geneva but went to Paris to put pressure on Britain and France again, obstructing the conclusion of an agreement on the cessation of hostilities in Indochina. Even at the last minute of the conference, the United States was still directing the representative of Cambodia to create side issues, obstructing the final signing of the armistice agreement. However, thanks to the persistent efforts of the Soviet Union, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and the People's Republic of China, as well as the positive attitude of the British and French delegations, whether the United States "liked" it or not, the Geneva Conference was not "written off" by the United States. On the contrary, agreements were reached that brought peace to Indochina. The conspiracy of the saboteurs of peace has failed. The United States has become even more isolated internationally.
    People all over the world welcome the return of peace to Indochina. However, some officials in the United States are the opposite. U.S. Secretary of Defense Wilson expressed "no interest" in the Indochina armistice. U.S. Senator Alexander Smith said: "This is a very bad deal." Another U.S. Senator, Sparkman, "doubted" how long the "life" of peace in Indochina could last. A United Press International dispatch from Washington on July 20th revealed: "American policymakers say that the United States' next focus will be on accelerating the formulation of plans to establish the Southeast Asia alliance." This shows that the American ruling group is not reconciled to its failure and has not abandoned its plan to organize so-called "joint action." This is something we must be vigilant about.
    However, the facts of the past year have proven that the American ruling group has neither the strength to continue the Korean War nor the strength to turn Indochina into "a second Korea." The forces of peace are gradually developing into an invincible force. In one year, two wars have been defeated by this great force. This great force of peace is not afraid of the United States' threats of "joint action." On the contrary, the United States' "joint action" must eventually be sent to the grave!

    和平的破坏者失败了
    江东
    日内瓦会议关于印度支那停战和恢复和平问题达成协议了。和一年前在朝鲜发生的事情一样，历史上将庄严地记载着：和平又一次战胜了战争！然而，和平的得来是不容易的。它是击败了美国从会议开始直到会议的最后一分钟的阻挠和破坏才赢得胜利的。
    谁都知道，美国对日内瓦会议曾极尽其破坏之能事。六月四日印度“政治家报”刊登了一则发自华盛顿的电讯说：“自杜勒斯以下的美国高级决策人员从来没有喜欢过日内瓦会议，他们把它当作预料中的失败一样把它一笔勾销。”美国自始至终正是用这种态度来对待日内瓦会议的。在日内瓦会议刚要开始时，杜勒斯就曾到伦敦和巴黎作了一次“闪电旅行”，向英国和法国施加压力，要他们按照美国的原则行事。日内瓦会议开始后不久，杜勒斯眼看自己的阻挠和破坏不能马上收效，他就决定让他的助手们和皮杜尔在日内瓦施展美国的政策，而自己却匆匆地返回美国，打算组织对印度支那战争的联合干涉，从根本上破坏日内瓦会议。六月十五日，美国代表团拒绝就和平解决朝鲜问题达成任何协议，而使朝鲜问题的讨论毫无结果而结束了。当时美国代表团打算把讨论印度支那问题的会议一并中断或者造成一个“无限期地休会”。六月下旬，各国外长暂时离开日内瓦时，史密斯在返回美国之前曾指示他的助手们，要他们“守住堡垒”，意思是说要坚持美国的破坏政策。七月中旬各国外长重返日内瓦时，杜勒斯没有回到日内瓦，却跑到巴黎去，又一次对英法施加压力，阻挠达成印度支那停战的协议。甚至到会议的最后一分钟，美国还在指使柬埔寨的代表节外生枝，阻挠最后在停战协定上的签字。然而，由于苏联、越南民主共和国和中华人民共和国三国的坚持努力，以及英国和法国两国代表团的积极态度，不管美国“喜欢”或“不喜欢”，日内瓦会议却没有被美国“一笔勾销”。相反地，而是达成了给印度支那带来和平的协议。和平破坏者的阴谋失败了。美国在国际上也就变得更加孤立了。
    全世界人民都欢迎和平重新降临印度支那。然而美国的某些官员们却相反，美国国防部长威尔逊表示对印度支那停战“不感兴趣”。美国参议员亚历山大·史密斯说：“这是一笔做得很坏的交易”。美国的另一位参议员斯巴克曼“怀疑”印度支那和平的“寿命”能有多长。合众社华盛顿七月二十日电讯透露：“美国的决策者们说，美国下一个重点将放在加速拟订成立东南亚联盟的计划上”。这说明美国统治集团并不甘心它的失败，并没放弃它的组织所谓“联合行动”的打算。这是我们要警惕的。
  然而，过去一年的事实证明，美国统治集团既没有力量把朝鲜战争打下去，也没有力量把印度支那变成“第二个朝鲜”。和平力量逐渐发展成为无往不胜的力量了。在一年中两个战争都被这个伟大的力量所战胜了。这个伟大的和平力量决不害怕美国的什么“联合行动”的恫吓，恰恰相反，美国的“联合行动”最后也一定要被送进坟墓！
