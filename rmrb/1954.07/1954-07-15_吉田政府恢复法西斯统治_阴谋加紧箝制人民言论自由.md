Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, July 14th: The Yoshida government is making every effort to restore militarist fascist rule to ensure the implementation of rearmament.

With the formulation and implementation of the new Police Law, the "Defense Secrets Protection Law," and the laws depriving teachers and staff of political rights, the Yoshida government's conspiracy to comprehensively suppress the people's freedom of speech is being intensified. Yoshida recently ordered Deputy Prime Minister Takeo Ogata, former president of the Information Bureau of the Koiso Cabinet, and Chief Cabinet Secretary Kenji Fukunaga to "flexibly use the Cabinet Investigation Office to strengthen intelligence gathering and propaganda activities," attempting to enforce a de facto prior censorship system on newspapers under the guise of protecting "defense secrets." This will be coordinated with the recent plan by Postal Minister Juichiro Tsukada to strengthen control over broadcasting.

The pre-war police system is being rebuilt. The notorious thought police "Tokko" (Special Higher Police) are rampant again. According to the Japanese National Postal Workers' Union, incidents of police investigating subscribers to "Akahata" (Red Flag newspaper) are constantly occurring in Gunma, Nagano, Tottori, Kochi, and Kanagawa prefectures. According to Kozo Inomata, a left-wing Socialist Party member, in the Diet, the Yoshida government is secretly training the police in special agent techniques such as secretly checking letters and taking covert photographs to strengthen the "Tokko's" reign of terror. Currently, the police not only arrest students collecting signatures for the prohibition of atomic weapons and suppress the people's peace movement, but are also openly used to beat opposition party members in the Diet.

The education sector is also being militarized step by step. The Yoshida government is persecuting all educators with a sense of justice and conducting ideological investigations of students. In May, the Kyoto education authorities, on the pretext of conducting "red education," ordered the dismissal of three teachers from Kyoto Asahigaoka Middle School. Incidents of police conducting ideological investigations on campuses have occurred at Yokohama National University and Tohoku University in Sendai. There have been more than a dozen cases of plainclothes police officers inducing students to provide information at Yokohama National University alone.

In order to facilitate the use of the Diet as a tool to help promote the policy of remilitarization, the Yoshida government has begun to discard even the decorations of liberal democracy. In early June, the Yoshida government manipulated the House of Representatives Steering (Management) Committee to make decisions such as "prohibiting visits to the Diet during sessions," "restricting attendance," and "prohibiting demonstrations near the Diet." Japanese public opinion sadly pointed out: This is a step towards restoring the pre-war "Imperial Diet."

### 吉田政府恢复法西斯统治  阴谋加紧箝制人民言论自由

    吉田政府恢复法西斯统治
    阴谋加紧箝制人民言论自由
    【新华社十四日讯】东京消息：吉田政府正在竭力恢复军国主义法西斯统治，以保证重整军备的进行。
    随着新警察法、“国防机密保护法”和剥夺教职员政治权利等法的拟订和实施，吉田政府全面地箝制人民言论自由的阴谋已在加紧进行。吉田最近命令副首相、前小矶内阁情报局总裁绪方竹虎和内阁官房长官福永健司要“灵活运用内阁调查室，加强收集情报和宣传活动”，企图以保护“防御机密”为名，强制实施对报刊的事实上的事前检查制度。这将和邮政相塚田十一郎最近所计划的加强对广播事业的控制相互配合。
    战前的警察制度正在重建。劣迹昭彰的思想警察“特高”（特别高等警察）又在飞扬跋扈地活动。据日本全递信从业员工会揭露，群马、长野、鸟取、高知和神奈川等县不断发生警察调查“赤旗报”订户的事件。据左派社会党议员猪俣浩三在国会揭露，吉田政府正在对警察进行秘密检查信件、暗地摄影等特务技术的训练，以加强“特高”的恐怖统治。目前，警察不仅逮捕收集禁止原子武器签名的学生，镇压人民的和平运动，而且公然被用来在国会殴打在野党议员。
    教育事业也在一步步军国主义化。吉田政府正在对一切具有正义感的教育工作者加以迫害，并对学生进行思想调查。五月里，京都教育当局以进行
  “赤色教育”为借口，下令解雇了京都旭丘中学的三位教员。在横滨国立大学和仙台东北大学已发生警察在校内进行思想调查的事件。便衣警察诱迫学生提供情报的事件，仅在横滨国立大学就有十数起。
    为了便于把国会作为帮助推行重新军国主义化政策的工具，吉田政府已在把点缀自由民主的装饰品也抛弃掉。六月初，吉田政府操纵众议院运营
  （管理）委员会作出了“禁止在国会开会时参观”、
  “限制旁听”和“禁止在国会附近举行示威”等项决定。日本舆论感慨地指出：这是恢复战前“帝国会议”的步骤。
