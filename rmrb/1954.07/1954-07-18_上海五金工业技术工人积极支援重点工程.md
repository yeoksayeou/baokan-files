    Shanghai Hardware Industry Technical Workers Actively Support Key Projects
    Technical workers in Shanghai's hardware industry have responded to the mobilization call of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government and the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, actively registering with the government labor departments, willing to support the country's key construction projects. This time, the Shanghai Municipal People's Government and the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, in accordance with the state plan, proposed to mobilize more than 2,000 technical workers above the fourth grade in hardware factories. However, by July 9, according to incomplete statistics, more than 4,500 workers had registered. Among them, the first batch of more than 50 technical workers who had been approved after review had already departed on July 2. On this day, the director of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government Labor Bureau and many factory worker representatives and workers' family members went to the railway station to see them off. He Yongjian and He Yongkang, two young workers from the Jinhua Shipbuilding Factory, had been yearning to go to Anshan Iron and Steel after the news that Anshan Iron and Steel had rolled out the first seamless steel pipe. This time they both registered together and were approved to leave in the first batch. When Wang Fukang, a lathe operator from Jinhua Electric Motor Factory, came to the station to see off his younger brother Wang Yongkang who was leaving in the first batch, he shook his hand and said, "Today I am here to see you off, and in a few days, you will be welcoming me on the construction site!"
    In the past four years, Shanghai has sent a total of more than 50,000 technical personnel, workers, and enterprise management cadres to various construction departments across the country. The more than 2,000 hardware technical workers mobilized this time are among the more technically skilled in-service workers. They will all depart successively within a month. In recent days, joint mobilization meetings have been held in areas where hardware factories are concentrated. On July 3, at the joint meeting convened by more than 40 public-private joint ventures and private factories in the Penglai District, more than 220 technical workers who met the mobilization conditions registered on the spot. Among them were many experienced masters with more than ten years of work experience and trade union cadres. (Xinhua News Agency)

    上海五金工业技术工人积极支援重点工程
    上海市五金工业中的技术工人响应上海市人民政府和上海总工会的动员号召，积极地向政府劳动部门报名，愿意去支援国家的重点建设工程。这次上海市人民政府和上海总工会根据国家计划，提出在五金工厂中动员二千多个四级以上的技术工人，但是到七月九日为止，据不完全统计，报名的已有四千五百多个工人。其中第一批经审查批准的五十多个技术工人已在七月二日出发，这一天，上海市人民政府劳动局局长和许多工厂的工人代表、工人家属都到火车站去欢送他们。金华机器造船厂的青年工人贺永健、贺永康兄弟两人，当鞍钢无缝钢管厂轧出第一根无缝钢管的消息传到时，就一直向往着到鞍钢去。这次他们一齐报了名，都被批准在第一批出发了。晋华电机厂车工王福康到车站来欢送第一批出发的弟弟王永康时，握着他的手说：“今天我来欢送你，过些日子，你就要在建设工地上迎接我啦！”
    上海在过去四年中已共输送了五万多个技术人员、工人和企业管理干部到全国各建设部门去。这次动员的二千多个五金技术工人，更是在业工人中技术较高的。他们都将在一个月内陆续出发。最近几天，五金工厂集中的地区都在召开联合的动员大会。七月三日，蓬莱区四十多个公私合营和私营工厂联合召开的大会上，有二百二十多个符合动员条件的技术工人当场报了名，他们中有许多是有十多年工龄的老师傅和工会干部。（新华社）
