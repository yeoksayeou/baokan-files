    Tens of thousands of workers at the First Automobile Works construction site, from June 20th to July 10th, used their evening and holiday rest time to conduct a widespread and in-depth discussion of the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China. After the discussion, the workers' enthusiasm for building socialism was even higher. Many workers expressed their heartfelt support for the Draft Constitution by creating advanced tools to accelerate the progress of the project, which played a positive role in the entire construction site exceeding the June construction task by 12 percent. The people in the construction carpentry shop fulfilled their promise made on the day the Draft Constitution was announced and successfully built the carpentry shop building on July 1st. Now they have投入 themselves into the construction of new factory buildings. Sun Wengui and Li Chunpu's team of sheet metal workers in the general assembly plant, the largest workshop of the automobile factory, broke the production quota for five consecutive days at the end of June, overfulfilling the June production plan; and used old iron instead of new iron to make "vents," saving the country more than 600,000 yuan. Now they are studying and creating two new tools. After the model worker Zhao Sheng's team discussed the Draft Constitution, they exceeded the new quota by 59 percent in the ground leveling work. Advanced worker Zhang Chunhua said: "I want to ensure the quality of the project and avoid rework, so as to accelerate socialist industrialization." Ding Fuchang's bricklaying team proposed to guarantee the completion of more than 461,000 bricks in July, without wasting a single brick or a shovel of ash during construction. Ding Fuchang said: "The Draft Constitution stipulates the bright road for our country to build a socialist society. We must pay attention to saving in construction, so that the country can use the money saved to build new factories." (Xinhua News Agency)

    第一汽车制造厂工地职工讨论宪法草案
    第一汽车制造厂工地数万职工从六月二十日起到七月十日止，利用晚上和例假的休息时间，对中华人民共和国宪法草案进行了普遍的比较深入的讨论。经过讨论后，工人们建设社会主义的劳动热情更加高涨，许多工人都以创造先进工具加快工程进度表示对宪法草案的衷心拥护，对全工地六月份超额百分之十二完成施工任务起了积极的推动作用。建设木工场的人们实现了他们在宪法草案公布那天提出的诺言，在“七一”这天把木工场厂房建设成功。现在他们又投入了新的厂房的建设。建设汽车制造厂最大车间总装配工厂的白铁工孙文贵、李春普小组在六月底一连五天突破生产定额，超额完成了六月份生产计划；并以旧铁代替新铁做“通风口”，为国家节省了六十多万元。现在他们正在研究创造两件新工具。劳动模范赵生小组讨论了宪法草案以后，在地平清理工作中超过新定额百分之五十九。先进工人张春华说：“我要保证工程质量，不返工，这样才能加速社会主义工业化。”丁富长瓦工小组提出保证在七月份完成砌砖四十六万一千多块的任务，施工中不浪费一块砖、一铲灰。丁富长说：“宪法草案规定我国建设社会主义社会的光明大道，我们要在建设中注意节约，使国家用节省下来的钱再去建设新的工厂。”　　（新华社）
