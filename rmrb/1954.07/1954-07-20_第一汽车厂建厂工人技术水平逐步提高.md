    At the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, an industrial construction force gathered from the Northeast countryside is rapidly growing. Recently, more than 3,000 rural Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members, as well as a large number of district and village cadres, transferred from Heilongjiang Province to basic construction posts. After skill assessment and grading, most have transformed from apprentices into skilled workers, with more than half reaching the level of third and fourth-grade skilled workers. Some district and village cadres have also been promoted to section chiefs, foremen, and management personnel.

    These young farmers from the countryside, upon arriving at the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, took on the task of excavating foundation earthwork for the factory buildings, displaying diligence, resilience, and a full labor enthusiasm. They overcame various difficulties during rainy season construction and excellently completed their construction tasks. Later, with the progress of construction projects and the increase in mechanized and factory-based construction, this fresh force in industrial construction gradually participated in various processing plants, mechanized supply stations, and specialized trades. They enthusiastically learned techniques from veteran workers and conscientiously implemented the suggestions of Soviet experts, quickly mastering the operating techniques of various construction machinery and becoming outstanding construction experts in various trades. For example, the concrete mixing station, after training a group of workers last year, has expanded from one station to three. The mixing task in May this year exceeded the total workload of the entire year last year. A large number of new workers, led by a few veteran technicians, are mastering the newly installed dozens of mixers, ensuring the daily supply of different grades of concrete needed by more than 20 construction sites. When the oxygen station of the East China Iron and Steel Company was first moved from Shanghai, only two veteran technicians served as production team leaders, and all the operators were newly arrived rural youth. The station chief thought it would take two or three years to teach these apprentices, but after two or three months of hard study, these apprentices were able to operate the machines and ensure the monthly completion of production tasks.

    The technical requirements of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant's construction project are very strict, with mechanized construction reaching about 70 percent. Initially, although these young apprentices worked hard, it was not easy to meet the state quotas. The Communist Party, trade union, and Communist Youth League organizations in each work area and processing plant organized them to conduct short-term amateur technical studies and launched a technical innovation campaign, enabling their technical level to continuously improve in the mutual teaching and learning movement. Many young workers have learned to read construction drawings and master operating procedures. For example, the concrete worker team of Meng Guangrong, Hu Xianchang, and Chen Fengqi from the 102nd work area initially did not know how to use concrete vibrators and could not guarantee the quality of the project. Under the guidance of Soviet experts and the help of construction workers, they learned the essentials of concrete compaction and gradually mastered mechanized construction methods. This year, when Hu Xianchang's team was making the deep pit foundation for the "elevator base" inside the carpentry shop, they researched a new method to increase efficiency by one time. When hitting reinforced concrete floor slabs, they researched a "slurry addition method" that reached the strict quality standards. When the new national labor quota was announced this year, these Party and League members from the countryside used their exemplary actions to actively think of ways to create new tools and improve labor organization to break through the new quota. In mid-June, 95 percent of the Communist Youth League members and more than half of the young workers in the first work section of the 102nd work area had reached and exceeded the new quota.

### 第一汽车厂建厂工人技术水平逐步提高

    第一汽车厂建厂工人技术水平逐步提高
    在第一汽车制造厂，从东北农村集结起来的一支工业建设队伍正在迅速成长。去年从黑龙江省转到基本建设岗位的三千多名农村共产党员和青年团员以及大批区、村干部，最近经过考工评级，大部分已由徒工变成技术工人，半数以上达到三级和四级技术工人水平。并有一部分区、村干部被提拔为工段长、工长和管理人员。
    这些来自农村的青年农民来到第一汽车制造厂后，担负着挖掘厂房基础土方的任务，表现出吃苦耐劳和饱满的劳动热情，战胜了雨季施工中的各种困难，出色地完成了施工任务。以后，随着建设工程的进展和机械化、工厂化施工比重提高，这批工业建设的生力军逐渐参加到各个加工厂、机械化供应站和各特殊工种行列中去工作。他们热情地向老工人学习技术，认真贯彻苏联专家建议，很快掌握了各种施工机械的操作技术，成为各工种出色的施工能手。如混凝土搅拌站，经过去年施工培养起来的一批工人，已由一个站分布到三个站。今年五月份的搅拌任务超过去年全年的工作量。大批新工人在少数老技术工人的带领下，掌握着新安装的几十台搅拌机，保证了每天对二十多个施工现场需要的不同标号混凝土的供应工作。华东钢铁公司氧气站刚从上海搬来时，只有两个老技术工人担任生产组长，担负操作的全部是新来的农村青年。站长认为教会这批徒工得花上两三年时间，可是这批徒工经过两三个月的刻苦学习，就能操纵机器，保证逐月完成生产任务了。
    第一汽车制造厂建筑工程的技术要求很严格，机械化施工达到百分之七十左右。起初这批青年徒工虽然努力工作，也不容易达到国家定额。各工区和加工厂共产党、工会、青年团的组织，组织他们进行短期的业余技术学习，开展了技术革新运动，使他们的技术水平在互教互学运动中不断得到提高。许多青年工人都学会了看施工图纸和掌握了操作规程。例如一零二工区孟广荣、胡显昌、陈凤岐等混凝土工小组，开始时不会使用混凝土震动器，不能保证工程质量。经过苏联专家指导和施工员帮助，他们学会了混凝土捣固法的要领，逐渐掌握了机械化施工方法。今年，胡显昌小组在作木工场内
  “升降机底座”的深坑基础时，研究出一种新方法提高效率一倍。打钢筋混凝土楼板时研究出一种
  “添浆法”，达到了要求严格的质量标准。当今年国家新劳动定额公布时，这些由农村来的党、团员，就以自己的模范行动，积极想法创造新的工具，改进劳动组织来突破新定额。六月中旬，一零二工区一工段就有百分之九十五的青年团员和半数以上的青年工人达到和突破了新定额。
