    Sino-Soviet Civil Aviation Corporation Holds Fourth Anniversary Celebration
    [Our Newspaper] Yesterday at 7:00 PM, over four hundred Soviet and Chinese staff members of the Sino-Soviet Civil Aviation Corporation in Beijing held a celebration marking the fourth anniversary of the Corporation's establishment. V. I. Likhachev, Counselor of the Soviet Embassy in China, was also invited to attend. At the meeting, Corporation Deputy General Manager Baulfilov and Deputy Director of the Sino-Soviet Civil Aviation Corporation Management Committee Wang Fengwu delivered speeches, and Corporation General Manager Shen Tu gave a report summarizing the work of the past four years.
    The Sino-Soviet Civil Aviation Corporation was established on July 1, 1950. In the past four years, the Corporation has completed 13.5 million ton-kilometers of flight, transporting tens of thousands of passengers, more than 1,600 tons of mail, and more than 4,700 tons of cargo. The Corporation has also played a significant role in China's economic construction. In 1953, industrial goods transportation accounted for 51 percent of all freight, and it made considerable contributions to forest surveying and transporting stud sheep and silkworm eggs. Currently, the Corporation's business has increased by 64 percent compared to the initial opening, and flight routes have also increased by 16.9 percent compared to the original.
    The Corporation has made good achievements in improving labor productivity and tapping potential strengths. At present, the flight hours borne by each aircraft have increased by 52.7 percent compared to the past; the fuel consumption rate of aircraft has decreased year by year under reasonable conditions, and the gasoline saved last year alone accounted for 7 percent of the annual fuel consumption. Under the condition of increased tasks and a small increase in personnel, the Corporation has overfulfilled the annually increasing production plans every year; the various production indicators for the first half of this year were completed 22 days ahead of schedule. Due to the above work achievements, the company's transportation costs have been decreasing year by year, and the transportation cost per ton-kilometer in 1953 decreased by 23.8 percent.
    The Corporation is not only a socialist advanced civil aviation transportation enterprise but also a school for training China's civil aviation personnel. In the past four years, under the enthusiastic education of Soviet staff, a large number of technical cadres for China's civil aviation industry have been trained; and measures such as centralized training, large group classes, and technical assessments have been taken to improve the business capabilities and technical levels of Chinese cadres in service.
    The meeting proceeded in a warm and friendly atmosphere. The Chinese and Soviet staff members present unanimously expressed that they would further strengthen Sino-Soviet friendship and work together to achieve greater achievements. After the meeting, Soviet and Chinese films were shown, and a dance party was held.

    中苏民用航空公司举行成立四周年纪念会
    【本报讯】昨日下午七时，中苏民用航空公司在北京的苏联和中国的工作人员四百多人，举行了中苏民用航空公司成立四周年纪念大会。苏联驻中国大使馆参赞维·依·里哈乔夫也应邀参加。会上，公司副总经理包尔菲洛夫、中苏民用航空公司管理委员会副主任委员王凤梧讲了话，公司总经理沈图作了四年来工作基本总结的报告。
    中苏民用航空公司于一九五○年七月一日成立。四年来，该公司完成一千三百五十万飞行吨公里，运输旅客数万人，运输邮件一千六百多吨，运输货物四千七百多吨。该公司在我国经济建设中也起了很大的作用，一九五三年工业品运输已占全部货运的百分之五十一，并对森林勘察、运载种羊和蚕种等工作有了不小的贡献。目前公司业务较开航初期增长百分之六十四，飞行航线也比原来增加百分之十六点九。
    该公司在提高劳动生产率和发掘潜在力量等方面都做出了良好成绩。目前每架飞机所担负的飞行小时，比过去提高百分之五十二点七；飞机的耗油率，在合理的条件下逐年下降，仅去年节约的汽油就占全年耗油量的百分之七。在任务加重、人员增加比例很小的情况下，该公司历年都超额完成了逐年提高的生产计划；今年上半年的各项生产指标已提前二十二天完成。由于以上的工作成绩，公司的运输成本逐年在降低，在一九五三年度每吨公里运输成本即降低百分之二十三点八。
    该公司不仅是一个社会主义先进民用航空运输企业，同时也是培养我国民用航空人员的学校。四年来，在苏联工作人员的热心教育下，已训练了成批的中国民用航空事业的技术干部；并采取集中轮训、大组上课及技术考绩等办法，提高了在职的中国干部的业务能力与技术水平。
    大会一直在热烈友好的气氛中进行。到会的中苏两方工作人员一致表示，要进一步加强中苏友谊，共同为取得更大的成绩而努力。会后放映苏联和中国的影片，并举行舞会。
