Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, July 18th: The delegations of the nine countries participating in the Geneva Conference on the Indochina issue held a restricted meeting on the afternoon of the 18th and issued the following communique:

"At the restricted meeting on July 18, the delegations of the nine countries continued to discuss the restoration of peace in Indochina."

Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, July 18th: After a series of informal consultations and meetings, the delegations of the nine countries held a restricted meeting on the 18th to continue discussions on the restoration of peace in Indochina.

Observers believe that this meeting was beneficial because it provided an assessment of the conference's work over the past month since the last meeting attended by the foreign ministers.

It is reported that the head of the Soviet delegation, Molotov, who chaired the meeting, pointed out, when assessing the significance of the conference's work and the work done by the assistants to the foreign ministers in the past period, that considerable important results had been achieved during this period. Molotov pointed out that it would be wrong to think that everything had been done and that there were no more difficult problems, but at the same time, the objective value of the results achieved during this period could not be denied.

The Soviet delegation believes that, first of all, in the most complex issue of restoring peace in Indochina, the solutions to the main problems have been clarified. That is to say, after recent negotiations, everyone has recognized the basis for resolving the issue of restoring peace in Vietnam, which opens up the possibility for the parties concerned to reach an agreement. The Soviet delegation believes that all participants in the conference will regard it as having the positive importance it deserves.

At the same time, it is reported that the Soviet delegation pointed out the importance of reaching corresponding agreements on the restoration of peace in Laos and Cambodia, while also pointing out that although perhaps not everything has been done in this regard, there is no doubt that the parties concerned are moving in the direction of reaching an agreement.

According to available information, the Soviet delegation pointed out that the recent contacts and frequent meetings between members of the delegations have played a beneficial role, and the Soviet delegation believes that these contacts and meetings have and will continue to pave the way for concrete solutions to outstanding issues.

It is reported that the Soviet delegation believes that the current situation is such that ceasefire proposals for Vietnam and Laos have been submitted to the conference. The conference has two such proposals, or at least there are two such proposals today. The same is true for Cambodia. It is also hoped that the parties concerned will express sincerity in order to reach a consensus on those parts of these agreements where the necessary agreements have not yet been reached. There are also two proposals for the Geneva Conference's declaration, which mainly concerns some important political issues. Corresponding draft declarations regarding Laos and Cambodia will also be submitted. Regarding the issue of international supervision of the implementation of the Indochina armistice agreements, after a long discussion, two proposals have now been put forward on this issue, and it probably will not take much time to reach an agreement on these two proposals.

The Soviet delegation believes that the above is an overview of the current situation of the Geneva Conference.

The attendees listened very attentively to the overall assessment of the work of the Geneva Conference in the past month presented by the Soviet delegation.

It is reported that the Bao Dai representative said at the meeting that, due to new instructions from his government, his delegation would like to present its views on some of the draft agreements submitted to the conference at a plenary session.

The US representative, Smith, in his speech, stated the position of the US delegation, pointing out that if an agreement acceptable to the United States is reached, then the United States will issue a separate statement stating that it will not use force or the threat of force to undermine the agreement.

    日内瓦会议讨论恢复印度支那和平问题
    苏联代表团对会议的进展提出总的评价
   【新华社日内瓦十八日电】参加日内瓦会议关于印度支那问题讨论的九个国家的代表团，十八日下午举行了限制性的会议后发表公报如下：
    “在七月十八日的限制性会议中，九国代表团继续讨论恢复印度支那和平问题。”
   【新华社日内瓦十八日电】在一连串的非正式的商谈和会晤之后，九国代表团在十八日举行限制性会议，继续讨论恢复印度支那和平问题。
    观察家们认为，这次会议是有益的，因为会上对于自从上次有外长们参加的会议以来的一个月中的会议工作作出了估计。
    据悉，担任这次会议主席的苏联代表团首席代表莫洛托夫在估计过去一段时期会议的工作和外长助理们所做的工作的意义时指出，这段时期取得了相当重要的成果。莫洛托夫指出，如果认为一切都已做完，不再有困难的问题，那就不对了，同时也不能否认这一时期所取得的成果的客观价值。
    苏联代表团认为，首先，在恢复印度支那和平这个最复杂的问题中，主要问题的解决办法已经明确下来了。这就是说，经过最近的谈判，大家已经承认了解决恢复越南和平问题的基础，这个基础打开了让有关各方达成协议的可能性。苏联代表团以为，会议的全体参加者会把它看作具有应有的肯定的重要性。
    同时，据悉，苏联代表团指出了就恢复老挝和柬埔寨的和平达成相应协议一事的重要性，并同时指出：虽然在这方面可能还不是一切事情都已办妥，但是无可怀疑，有关各方都是朝着达成协议的方向走的。
    根据现有的消息，苏联代表团指出：最近各代表团成员之间的接触和频繁的会谈起了有益的作用，苏联代表团并相信：这种接触和会谈已经而且还将继续为具体地解决尚未解决的问题铺平道路。
    据悉，苏联代表团认为，目前的情况是这样：越南和老挝的停战方案已经提交会议。会议有了两种这样的方案，或者无论如何今天还有着两种这样的方案。关于柬埔寨的情形也是这样。还希望有关方面表示诚意，以求就这些协定内尚未取得必要的协议那些部分达成一致的意见。会议上对日内瓦会议的宣言也有两种方案，这个宣言主要是关于一些重要的政治问题的。有关老挝和柬埔寨的相应的声明的方案也将提出。关于就印度支那停战协定的履行进行国际监察的问题，经过长期讨论后，现在已就这一问题提出两种方案，在这两种方案上取得协议大概不需要很多时间。
    苏联代表团认为，以上所述，就是日内瓦会议目前情况的概貌。
    到会者十分注意地听取了苏联代表团提出的对日内瓦会议最近一月来的工作的总的评价。
    据悉，保大代表在会上说，由于他的政府有新的指示，他的代表团想在全体会议上就提交会议的一些协定方案提出自己的看法。
    美国代表史密斯在他的发言中表明了美国代表团的立场，他指出，如果达成了为美国所赞同的协议，那末美国将发表单独声明，声明不使用武力、也不用使用武力的威胁来破坏协议。
