    Anhui Province's Flood-Free Areas Launch Agricultural Production Increase Campaign

    Striving for a Further 10% Increase in Production on Hilly and Upland Fields to Compensate for Disaster Area Losses

    In the flood-free areas of Anhui Province, the broad masses of farmers are launching an agricultural production increase campaign, striving to increase production by another 10% or so on the original planned increase target for tens of millions of mu of hilly, upland, and other fields, in order to compensate for losses suffered by some areas due to flooding. Currently, in the flood-free areas, Party organizations and People's Governments are mobilizing farmers to revise production increase plans and strive to achieve new production increase targets. The Northwest Township Branch of the Communist Party of China in Su County is leading farmers throughout the township to strengthen field management of autumn crops, prevent and control pests and diseases, and expand the planting area of autumn crops, striving to increase grain production by 300,000 jin. In Feixi County, the five agricultural production cooperatives in Ruidian Township, in order to achieve the requirement of a further 10% increase in production, have universally hoed, top-dressed, and dried the fields (draining the water from the fields before the rice is about to ripen to promote ripening) for more than 200 mu of early rice and mid-season rice. They have planted soybeans and mung beans on more than 360 field ridges, and intercropped mung beans in the ditches of more than 30 mu of cotton fields. In addition, they are paying attention to increasing fertilizer application and rational irrigation for 45 mu of early rice and mid-season rice fields prepared for cultivating ratooning rice.

    As early as the second half of June, the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China analyzed the province's rainfall and climate conditions and issued instructions to local committees, requiring flood-free areas to complete the task of increasing production by another 10% or so by strengthening field management, increasing fertilizer application, and changing cultivation systems. Subsequently, the local committees of Lu'an, Fuyang, and other areas successively held emergency meetings to study measures to increase production. Hanshan County in the Wuhu Special District also held a mountain area production conference, attended by more than 250 people including cadres above the township level, heads of agricultural production cooperatives, leaders of mutual aid teams, and experienced elderly farmers, who specifically studied methods to increase grain production by more than 1.2 million jin on the county's 300,000 mu of hilly fields. Relevant agencies in Anhui Province are also actively assisting in the development of production increase campaigns in flood-free areas. The Lu'an Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative expanded the supply of fertilizer by 18 million jin, and the People's Bank in this area also cooperated to issue fertilizer loans of 1.9 billion yuan in the third quarter.

    安徽未受水涝地区农民开展农业增产运动
    争取山田岗田再增产一成弥补灾区损失
    安徽省没有受涝的地区，广大农民正在开展农业增产运动，努力争取数千万亩山田、岗田及其他田地在原订增产计划的基础上再增产一成左右，以弥补部分地区因涝灾所受的损失。目前没有受涝的地区，党组织和人民政府正发动农民修订增产计划，努力实现新的增产指标。中共宿县西北乡支部正领导全乡农民加强秋季作物田间管理，防治病虫害，扩大秋季作物种植面积，为增产三十万斤粮食而努力。肥西县芮店乡的五个农业生产合作社为实现再增产一成的要求，已经对二百多亩早稻和中稻普遍薅草、追肥和烤田（稻子快要成熟前把田水放干，促使成熟），在三百六十多条田埂上种了黄豆和绿豆，在三十多亩棉田沟里也套种了绿豆，此外还对准备培养再生稻的四十五亩早稻和中稻田注意增施肥料和合理灌水。
    早在六月下半月，中共安徽省委员会就对全省雨量气候情况作了分析，向各地方委员会发出指示，要求没有受涝的地区从加强田间管理，增施肥料，改变栽培制度等方面来完成再增产一成左右的任务。随后中共六安、阜阳等地方委员会都相继召开紧急会议，研究了增产措施。芜湖专区含山县并召开山区生产会议，有乡以上干部、农业生产合作社社长、互助组组长和有经验的老年农民二百五十多人参加，他们具体地研究了全县三十万亩山田增产一百二十多万斤粮食的办法。安徽省有关机关也积极协助没有受涝的地区增产运动的开展。六安专区供销合作社扩大供应肥料一千八百万斤，这个地区的人民银行也配合在第三季度发放肥料贷款十九亿元。　　　　（新华社）
