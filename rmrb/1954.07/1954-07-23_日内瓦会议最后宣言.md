Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, July 21st: The final declaration of the Geneva Conference on the Problem of Restoring Peace in Indochina, attended by representatives of Cambodia, the State of Vietnam, the United States of America, the French Republic, Laos, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the People's Republic of China, the United Kingdom, and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, July 21, 1954.

I. The Conference takes note of the agreements ending hostilities in Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam, which establish international supervision and surveillance regarding the implementation of their terms.

II. The Conference welcomes the end of hostilities in Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam. The Conference is convinced that the implementation of the provisions stipulated in this declaration and the agreements on the cessation of hostilities will enable Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam henceforth to play their part in the international family of peace in complete independence and sovereignty.

III. The Conference takes note of the statements by the governments of Cambodia and Laos that they are willing to take measures to enable all citizens to participate in national life, especially in the upcoming general elections, which will be held in 1955 under the supervision of international commissions composed of representatives of Member States in which freedom of thought has been achieved, and under conditions of respect for fundamental freedoms through secret ballot.

IV. The Conference takes note of the provisions of the Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities in Vietnam prohibiting the introduction into Vietnam of foreign troops and military personnel as well as all kinds of arms and ammunition. The Conference also takes note of the declarations by the governments of Cambodia and Laos that they are determined not to request foreign aid regarding military supplies, personnel, and instructors, unless for the purpose of effectively defending their territory, and in Laos, even more so, limited to the scope stipulated in the Lao Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities.

V. The Conference takes note of the provision in the Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities in Vietnam prohibiting the establishment of any foreign military bases in the regrouping zones of both sides. At the same time, both sides should ensure that the areas assigned to them do not participate in any military alliance and are not used to resume hostilities or serve a policy of aggression. The Conference also takes note of the declarations by the governments of Cambodia and Laos, according to which the two countries will not conclude any agreement with other countries if such agreement includes the obligation to participate in military alliances that do not conform to the principles of the United Nations Charter, and in the case of Laos, even more so, do not conform to the principles of the Lao Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities, or includes the obligation to establish bases for foreign military forces on Cambodian or Lao territory when their security is not threatened.

VI. The Conference affirms that the primary purpose of the agreements on Vietnam is to settle military questions in order to end hostilities, and affirms that the military demarcation line is a temporary line and in no way can be interpreted as a political or territorial boundary. The Conference is convinced that the implementation of the provisions stipulated in this declaration and the agreement on the cessation of hostilities will create the necessary prerequisites for achieving a political settlement in Vietnam in the near future.

VII. The Conference declares that, regarding Vietnam, the solution to all political problems, based on respect for the principles of independence, unity, and territorial integrity, should ensure that the Vietnamese people enjoy the fundamental freedoms guaranteed by democratic institutions established through free general elections by secret ballot. In order for the restoration of peace to make sufficient progress and for all necessary conditions for the free expression of national will to be met, general elections will be held in July 1955 under the supervision of an international commission composed of representatives of Member States of international commissions of countries in which freedom of thought has been achieved, as stipulated in the Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities. Starting from July 20, 1955, the responsible authorities with representatives from both regions should consult on this matter.

VIII. The provisions of the Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities regarding guaranteeing the protection of life and property must be strictly implemented, in particular, everyone in Vietnam must be able to freely choose the area in which he wishes to reside.

IX. The responsible authorities with representatives from the North and South regions of Vietnam, as well as the authorities of Laos and Cambodia, must not engage in individual or collective reprisals against personnel or their families who have cooperated with the other side in any way during the war.

X. The Conference takes note of the declaration by the Government of the French Republic that it is willing, at the request of the governments concerned, to withdraw its troops from the territories of Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam within a period to be agreed upon by both parties; but this does not apply if, by agreement between both parties, a certain number of French troops remain stationed in designated locations within the agreed period.

XI. The Conference takes note of the declaration by the French Government that it will resolve all issues related to the restoration and consolidation of peace in Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam on the basis of respect for the independence, sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity of the three countries.

XII. Each participating state of the Geneva Conference, in its relations with Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam, guarantees to respect the sovereignty, independence, unity, and territorial integrity of the aforementioned countries, and not to interfere in their internal affairs in any way.
