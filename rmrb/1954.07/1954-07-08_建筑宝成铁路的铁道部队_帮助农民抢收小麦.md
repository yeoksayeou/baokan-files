    Railway Troops Building the Baoji-Chengdu Railway
    Help Peasants Harvest Wheat
    The Railway Corps of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, participating in the construction of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway in southern Shaanxi Province, actively helped local farmers harvest wheat. According to incomplete statistics, by June 20th, the various units had helped farmers harvest more than 1,270 mu of wheat.
    Southern Shaanxi Province had a bumper wheat harvest this year, but there was a lot of rain, so if it was not harvested in time, it would affect the harvest. The railway troops stationed there used holidays and rest time to help the masses harvest. A certain company helped local farmers harvest 386 mu of wheat in three days.
    The actions of the railway troops in caring for the interests of the people were loved by the farmers. An elderly peasant woman, Liu, whose two sons were captured by the Kuomintang bandits, said: If it weren't for the help of the People's Liberation Army, I don't know how much my wheat would have lost. The People's Liberation Army is truly the people's army. Farmers in a certain township, to thank a certain company for their help, specially sent them a silk banner with the words: "Defend the Motherland, Love the People, Steel Warriors Courageously Building."

    建筑宝成铁路的铁道部队
    帮助农民抢收小麦
    中国人民解放军铁道兵在陕西省南部参加建筑宝成铁路的部队，积极帮助驻地农民抢收小麦。据不完全统计，到六月二十日止，各部队已帮助农民收割了一千二百七十多亩小麦。
    陕西省南部今年小麦丰收，但是雨水较多，如不及时抢收，就将影响收成。驻在当地的铁道兵部队就利用假日和休息时间帮助群众抢收。某连在三天中就帮助驻地农民割麦子三百八十六亩。
    铁道兵部队关心人民利益的行动受到了农民的热爱。有两个儿子都被国民党匪军抓走的贫苦农户刘大妈说：如果没有解放军帮助，我的小麦不知要受多少损失，解放军真是人民的队伍。某乡农民为了感谢某连的帮助，特送给他们一面锦旗，上面写着：“卫祖国，爱人民，奋勇建设的钢铁战士”。
