    Beijing Cooperatives Expand Retail Network in Newly Built Areas

    Beijing Cooperatives are vigorously developing the retail network in newly built areas to adapt to the development of the capital's construction.

    Cooperative organizations and businesses are constantly developing in key newly built areas of Beijing such as the new urban district, the eastern suburban factory district, and the Haidian cultural and educational district. As of the end of May this year, 105 cooperative distribution outlets have been established in the aforementioned areas, along with over 50 service units offering dining, barber services, laundry, tailoring, and watch repair. However, these institutions are not sufficient to meet the needs of the developing capital construction and the broad masses of workers. According to the instructions of the Beijing Municipal People's Government Financial and Economic Committee, the Beijing Cooperatives Union has further expanded the organization and business of cooperatives in the newly built areas. In the past month or so, the New Urban District Consumer Cooperative, the Eastern Suburban District Supply and Marketing Cooperative, and the Haidian Organ School United Consumer Cooperative have successively established 21 new distribution outlets in factories, schools, government offices, construction sites, and residential areas. Among them, the Gu Temple Branch of the New Urban District Consumer Cooperative has over a thousand kinds of goods. At the same time, the New Urban District Consumer Cooperative expanded the Yongding Road Branch, adding over 370 kinds of goods such as mountain products, and added meat and vegetable sections or vegetable sections to distribution outlets in places such as the Central Public Security Academy. The Eastern Suburban District Supply and Marketing Cooperative added tobacco, alcohol, and fruit sections to the distribution outlet of the State-owned No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory and established ten mobile tricycle sales carts and two canvas sales sheds. The New Urban District Consumer Cooperative also established three new canvas sales sheds and established an office service group to serve government offices, especially those that do not have the conditions to establish consumer cooperatives. In addition, the New Urban District Consumer Cooperative is building a canteen, barber shop, laundry, photo studio, tailoring department, and bicycle repair shop on Yongding Road, which will be completed by the end of the month and strive to open on "August 1st". The Haidian District Organ School United Consumer Cooperative is rushing to repair the Post and Telecommunications School branch and will also be able to start business next month.

    北京市合作社扩大新建区的零售网
    北京市合作社适应首都建设的发展情况，在新建区大力发展零售网。
    北京市新市区、东郊工厂区和海淀文教区等重点新建区的合作社，组织机构和业务都在不断发展。截至今年五月底止，上述地区设立的合作社分销处已有一百零五处，同时附设有食堂、理发、洗衣、缝纫及修理钟表等服务性业务单位五十余处。但是这些机构还不足以适应首都建设的发展和广大职工的需要。根据北京市人民政府财政经济委员会的指示，北京市合作社联合社进一步扩大了新建区合作社的组织和业务。一个多月来，新市区消费合作社、东郊区供销合作社和海淀机关学校联合消费合作社已先后在工厂、学校、机关、工地及家属聚居地区新建立了二十一处分销处，其中新市区古庙门市部拥有千种以上的商品。同时，新市区消费合作社扩大了永定路门市部，增添了山货等三百七十余种商品，在中央公安学院等分销处增设了肉菜部或蔬菜部；东郊区供销合作社在国营第一棉纺织厂分销处增设了烟酒水果部，并设立流动三轮售货车十辆、帆布售货棚两处；新市区消费合作社也新设立帆布售货棚三处，并成立了机关服务组，专为机关、特别是没有条件建立消费合作社的机关服务。此外，新市区消费合作社正在永定路修建食堂、理发铺、洗衣房、照像馆，缝纫部及自行车修理部，月底即可完工，争取“八一”开业。海淀区机关学校联合消费合作社正在抢修邮电学校门市部，下月也可以开始营业。
