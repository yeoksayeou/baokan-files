The Railway Corps of the People's Liberation Army is working intensely in the dense forests of the Lesser Khingan Mountains to build the Tangwang River Forest Line in Northeast China.

The current year's project for the Tangwang River Forest Line began in full swing in late May. The completion of this section of the railway, and its continued extension into the heart of the forest, will gradually unlock the vast timber resources of the Lesser Khingan Mountains, supplying the needs of the country's construction.

The Railway Corps of the People's Liberation Army is undertaking the construction task for this section of the railway. The project includes 1.08 million cubic meters of earth and stone work and 50 bridges and culverts, scheduled for completion by the end of October. In the preparatory work, this unit made use of spare time to rush-produce a large number of wooden tools; one unit alone self-made more than 7,850 various tools in ten days. The signal corps also climbed mountains and crossed rivers to complete the line laying task ahead of schedule, ensuring smooth line communication. During the line re-survey, the engineering department proposed a line change suggestion, saving the country more than 420 million yuan. Since the official start of construction, many soldiers have launched labor competitions, resulting in a gradual increase in construction efficiency. Cadres and soldiers of the Third Battalion put forward 18 rationalization proposals in seven days. The "layered excavation method" implemented on a trial basis in the Sixth Company increased the average daily excavation volume per person in the entire company by one-third. Now the progress of the entire line project is quite rapid.

    铁道兵某部建筑汤旺河森林线进展迅速
    参加建筑东北森林铁路汤旺河森林线的中国人民解放军铁道兵某部，正在小兴安岭的茂密森林中紧张施工。
    汤旺河森林线本年度工程已在五月下旬全面动工。这一段铁路的建成和继续向森林腹地伸展，就可使小兴安岭森林宝库中的亿万木材被逐渐开发出来，供应祖国建设的需要。
    人民解放军铁道兵某部担负这一段铁路的建筑任务，其工程计有土石方一百零八万方，桥涵五十座，预计十月底完工。在施工准备工作中，这支部队利用空隙赶制了大批木质工具，仅一支部队在十天中就自制了各种工具七千八百五十多件。通讯兵们也翻山涉水，提前完成了架线任务，保证线路联络的畅通。工程部门在线路复测时提出一项改线建议，为国家节约了人民币四亿二千多万元的开支。正式开工以后，有很多战士发起了劳动竞赛，使施工效率日渐提高。第三营的干部、战士们在七天中就提出了十八件合理化建议。在第六连试行推广的“分层挖土法”，使全连每人每天的挖土量平均提高了三分之一。现在全线工程的进展相当迅速。
