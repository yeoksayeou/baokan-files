Reader's Letters Abstract:
Editor's note: The following three readers' letters reflect the lack of a conscientious and responsible attitude of some state organs and state-owned enterprise personnel in handling state materials, allowing private merchants to exploit loopholes and causing losses to the state. All localities should pay attention to this.

Why Were Private Merchants Able to Exploit Loopholes?

“Slow-Moving Goods” Have Returned
    Yang Yuanping of the Tianjin Municipal People's Government State-Owned Commercial Bureau writes: In September 1952, the Shenyang Regional Wholesale Station of the China Department Store Company (hereinafter referred to as the Wholesale Station) received over one thousand sheets of "Fuji Steel Plates" (for copying) allocated by the Shenyang Municipal Department Store Company, imported from Japan. At that time, the Wholesale Station casually stored this batch of steel plates in the warehouse, forgetting to process them. It was not until April of last year, when the warehouse was being cleared, that the Wholesale Station took out some of the steel plates and handed them over to the stationery and paper wholesale department for sale, pricing them at 58,000 yuan per sheet; while the actual market price was nearly 300,000 yuan per sheet.
    In July of last year, the manager of the Tianjin private Jin Xing Commercial Firm came to Shenyang to buy goods and accidentally discovered this batch of cheap goods, wanting to buy hundreds of sheets at once. The sales clerk thought, "Why does this merchant want to buy so many steel plates all at once if they have been slow to sell for so long?" So he suspected that the price might be too low and asked the price control section chief for instructions. The price control section chief affirmed that "there is no problem with the price"; and in order to speed up the handling of these "slow-moving goods," the original price of 58,000 yuan per sheet was even reduced to 54,000 yuan for sale. Jin Xing Commercial Firm bought 450 sheets at once. The Tianjin private Hua Cheng Commercial Firm heard this news and rushed to Shenyang to buy 150 sheets of steel plates from the Wholesale Station. Subsequently, Jin Xing Commercial Firm traveled from Tianjin to Shenyang to continue purchasing. As a result, the sales clerk became even more suspicious of the price problem and asked the relevant leading cadres for instructions, but the reply he received was still "no problem." As a result, all the "Fuji Steel Plates" stored in the Wholesale Station were sold to two private merchants: Hua Cheng Commercial Firm bought 150 sheets, and Jin Xing Commercial Firm bought another 579 sheets.
    After the Wholesale Station sold all the "Fuji Steel Plates," an out-of-stock phenomenon immediately occurred. Therefore, through the station's Tianjin office, it requested the Tianjin Purchasing and Supply Station of the China Department Store Company to transfer goods. The Tianjin Purchasing and Supply Station also had no stock at the time, so it purchased 300 sheets of "Fuji Steel Plates" from Jin Xing Commercial Firm in three batches in October and November of last year, at a price of 275,000 yuan per sheet, and transferred 100 of them to the Wholesale Station. After receiving this batch of steel plates, the Wholesale Station discovered that these steel plates were originally the same ones that they had sold as "slow-moving goods" at a reduced price. Now, these "slow-moving goods" have returned, the only difference being that the purchase price is more than four times higher than the selling price.

　　　　“Cull Goods” Were Snapped Up
    Zhang Wanxin and Yu Zhaodong of the Chongwen District Tax Bureau of Beijing Municipality write: Recently, we discovered that eight stall vendors in this district, including Gao Chengxi and Sun Maokuan, have purchased a total of 9,732 catties of imported steel wire ropes of various specifications from the Qingdao Branch of the China Hardware and Machinery Company (hereinafter referred to as the Qingdao Branch) since November of last year. The selling price of this batch of steel wire ropes was particularly low. After the vendors bought the goods, they could make a profit of nearly double the original price with a single resale. For example, the price of steel wire rope purchased by vendor Zhen Junsheng from the Qingdao Branch was only 7,500 yuan per catty, while he resold it to local merchants in the city for 14,500 yuan per catty. And the local merchants could still make a large profit by reselling it again. For example, Wan Xingyong, a local merchant, purchased a total of 5,596 catties of one-inch steel wire rope from vendors such as Gao Chengxi at an average selling price of 13,670 yuan per catty; when reselling it to state-owned enterprise departments such as the Engineering Company of the Central Textile Industry Ministry, the selling price was 18,000 to 20,000 yuan per catty. It is said that this price was assessed by the Beijing Trust Company according to the price of new goods.
    Why was the selling price of this batch of steel wire rope from the Qingdao Branch so cheap? It turned out that this batch of imported steel rope had been in storage for a long time, and the surface was slightly rusted. The Qingdao Branch considered it to be "non-standard" and "unsuitable for use by industrial and mining enterprises," and sold it as used goods in the company's cull department at a large discount, regardless of the buyer. As a result, many private merchants from Beijing and other places rushed to buy it upon hearing the news. In this way, state property suffered losses.

Let Private Merchants Earn Eighteen Times the Profit
    Reader Zhang Wanxin writes: On April 28, stall vendors such as Li Xiang in Chongwen District, Beijing, purchased a pile of lead soil from the Directly Subordinate Communication Section (hereinafter referred to as the "Communication Section") of the Central Railway Ministry's Telecommunications Bureau. This lead soil weighed a total of 3,960 catties and contained a large amount of lead. As long as it was melted at a high temperature, a considerable amount of lead could be extracted. However, the personnel handling the matter in the Communication Section treated it as waste, calculated the price by the pile without weighing it, and sold nearly 4,000 catties of lead soil to private merchants for 700,000 yuan. After buying this large pile of lead soil, these vendors resold it at 3,300 yuan to 3,500 yuan per catty, earning a total of more than 13,460,000 yuan, with a profit exceeding eighteen times the purchase price.
    The personnel handling the matter in the Communication Section treated state materials with such a careless attitude. I think they are too irresponsible in their work.

### 为什么被私商钻了空子

专栏：读者来信摘要

    编者按：下面发表的三件读者来信反映了某些国家机关和国营企业的工作人员在处理国家物资时缺乏认真负责的精神，被私商钻了空子，使国家受到了损失。各地应该对此引起注意。
    为什么被私商钻了空子
    “滞销货”又回门了
    天津市人民政府国营商业局杨源平来信：一九五二年九月，中国百货公司沈阳地区批发站（以下简称批发站）接收了沈阳市百货公司拨给的从日本进口的一千多块“不二钢板”（复写用），当时批发站随手把这批钢板存入仓库，忘了处理。直到去年四月清理仓库时，批发站才取出一部分钢板交给该站文具纸张批发部出售，每块定价五万八千元；而市场上的实际价格每块将近三十万元。
    去年七月，天津市私营金兴商行经理到沈阳买货时，偶然发现了这批便宜货，一下就要买几百块。售货员同志就想：“长期销不出的钢板，为什么这个商人一下子就要买这么多呢？”于是怀疑可能是定价太低了，便请示物价股长。物价股长却肯定地说“价格没有问题”；而且为了加速处理这批“滞销货”还将原定价每块五万八千元减至五万四千元出售。金兴商行一次就买走了四百五十块。天津市私营华成商行听到这个消息也赶到沈阳向批发站要买一百五十块钢板，接着，金兴商行又从天津赶到沈阳继续购买。这样一来，售货员对价格问题更加怀疑了，又向有关的领导干部请示，但得到的回答还是“没问题”。结果批发站所存的“不二钢板”全部卖给了两家私商：华成商行买了一百五十块，金兴商行又买到了五百七十九块。
    批发站将“不二钢板”全部卖出后，立即发生了脱销现象，于是就通过该站驻津办事处请求中国百货公司天津采购供应站调货。天津采购供应站当时也没有存货，就在去年十月和十一月间分三次向金兴商行购买了“不二钢板”三百块，每块价格是二十七万五千元，并将其中的一百块调给批发站。批发站在接到这批钢板后，发现这批钢板原来还是他们曾经作为“滞销货”而减价出卖的。现在这批“滞销货”又回门了，所不同的是：买进来的价格比卖出去的价格一下子就大了四倍多。
　　　　“剔庄货”被抢购了
    北京市崇文区税务分局张万信、于兆栋来信：最近我们发现本区高成禧、孙茂宽等八家摊商从去年十一月份起先后向中国五金机械公司青岛分公司（以下简称青岛分公司）买了各种规格的进口货钢丝绳共九千七百三十二市斤。这批钢丝绳售价特别低廉，摊商们把货买回后一转手就能获得将近原本一倍的厚利。如摊商甄俊声从青岛分公司买回的钢丝绳每市斤价格仅七千五百元，而他转卖给本市座商时每市斤就是一万四千五百元。而座商们再转一次手，还能获得很大的利润。如座商万兴永共向高成禧等摊商收购了一吋规格的钢丝绳五千五百九十六市斤，平均每斤售价为一万三千六百七十元；当转卖给中央纺织工业部工程公司等国营企业部门时，每斤售价就是一万八千元至两万元。据说这个价格是经过北京市信托公司按照新货评定的。
    青岛市分公司这批钢丝绳的售价为什么这样便宜呢？原来这批进口钢绳库存久了，表面上稍为生了一些锈。青岛市分公司就认为这是“非规格品”，“不适合工矿企业部门使用”，而当作旧货放在该公司的剔庄部不分对象地大减价出售了。结果，北京等地不少私商纷纷闻风前往抢购。这样，就使国家财产受到了损失。让私商赚了十八倍的利润
    读者张万信来信：北京市崇文区摊商李祥等在四月二十八日向中央铁道部电务局直属通信段（以下简称“通信段”）购买铅土一堆。这些铅土共重三千九百六十斤，是通信段从蓄电池中打扫出来的，含铅量很大，只要经过高温度的熔化，就会提炼出不少的铅来。但是通信段经办人员却把它当成废物，没有过称就论堆计算，以七十万元的价格把将近四千斤铅土卖给私商了。这些摊商买回了这大堆铅土后，就以每斤三千三百元到三千五百元转手卖出了，共计卖了一千三百四十六万余元，利润超过买价的十八倍。
    通信段经办人员以这样轻率的态度处理国家物资，我觉得他们对待工作太不负责任了。
