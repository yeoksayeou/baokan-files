    New High-Voltage Transmission Line Project Between Beijing and Tianjin Begins Construction

    The new high-voltage transmission line project between Beijing and Tianjin officially commenced full-scale construction on July 4th. This line is designed with a larger capacity, and the amount of electricity transmitted will be significantly increased compared to the old line. The old line, due to its small capacity, can no longer fully bear the ever-increasing electricity transmission tasks. In the future, after the new line starts transmitting electricity, many newly built and expanded projects in the capital's buildings, factories, and mines can obtain sufficient power and lighting electricity from Tianjin's surplus electricity.

    The new high-voltage transmission line is over one hundred kilometers long and will have dozens of iron towers and hundreds of cement poles erected. All the materials required for the project, such as steel, steel-cored aluminum wire, porcelain insulators, and cement, are products from domestic factories. Alongside the transmission line, a communication line will also be erected simultaneously to facilitate timely communication and contact for line patrol personnel in order to maintain the line and ensure safe power transmission.

    Planning for this line project began as early as last November. In the severe winter, surveying personnel braved wind and snow to conduct surveying and route selection work. The designers collected data and designed simultaneously, completing the preliminary design and construction blueprints in the six months from the end of last November to the end of this May. All the materials used in the new line project, from large steel materials to ash, sand, stone, and screws, must undergo physical testing and chemical analysis to ensure the quality of the project.

    北京天津间新建高压送电线路工程动工
    北京、天津间新建的高压送电线路工程，已在七月四日开始全面动工。这条线路设计容量较大，送电量将比旧线路有很大的增加。旧线路因为容量小，已不能全部担负起越来越大的送电任务。将来新线路开始送电后，首都的许多建筑大厦、工矿企业中新建扩建工程，就可以从天津的富余电力中获得足够的动力和照明用电。
    新的高压送电线路全长一百多公里，将架设数十座铁塔和数百个水泥杆子。工程所需的钢材、钢芯铝线、瓷瓶、水泥等器材，全部是国内工厂的制品。在送电线路旁边，还将同时架设一条通讯线路，供巡线的工作人员及时通讯联络，以维护线路，保证安全送电。
    这条线路工程早在去年十一月间就着手筹划。在严寒的冬季，勘测人员们冒着风雪进行勘测和选线工作。设计人员一面搜集资料，一面设计，在去年十一月底到今年五月底的六个月中，就做好了初步设计和施工蓝图。新线路工程所用的全部器材，从大型钢材到灰、砂、石和螺丝钉等，都要经过物理试验和化学分析，以保证工程质量。（新华社）
