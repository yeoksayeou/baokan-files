Credit Cooperative Organizations in Various Parts of Northeast China
Actively Issue Summer Hoeing Loans

More than 2,500 credit cooperatives and credit departments in Northeast China are actively issuing summer hoeing loans. From spring plowing to summer hoeing, they have issued agricultural loans totaling 81.4 billion yuan, equivalent to 11.7 percent of the agricultural loans issued by the state banks during the same period.

The Northeast Branch of the People's Bank of China and its subordinate branches and sub-branches in various localities have generally actively helped credit cooperative organizations expand deposits and develop lending business before and after the start of summer hoeing. The People's Bank of China branches in GaiPing, Suihua and other counties have convened meetings of directors of credit cooperatives and credit departments to study and arrange summer hoeing loan work. In the past two months, the Manrongtun and Jiuzhan credit cooperatives in the southern suburbs and eastern suburbs of Shenyang have issued loans of more than 146 million yuan, most of which were used to help farmers solve the difficulties of applying topdressing fertilizer during the weeding period. The Xinglong Credit Cooperative in the Third District of Zhuanghe County, Liaodong Province, issued more than 40 million yuan in ammonium sulfate and sesame cake loans, enabling local farmers to apply sufficient fertilizer during the summer hoeing period.

    东北各地信用合作组织
    积极发放夏锄贷款
    东北区二千五百多个信用合作社和信用部积极发放夏锄贷款，从春耕到夏锄期间，已发放农业贷款八百一十四亿元，相当于国家银行在同一时期发放农业贷款数的百分之十一点七。
    中国人民银行东北区行及所属各地分行、支行，在夏锄开始前后，一般都积极帮助信用合作组织扩大存款，展开放款业务。人民银行盖平、绥化等县支行都曾召开信用合作社、信用部主任会议，研究安排了夏锄放款工作。沈阳市南郊区满融屯、东郊旧站两个信用合作社在最近两个月中，即发放贷款一亿四千六百多万元，大部分用来帮助农民解决了铲?期间施追肥等困难。辽东省庄河县第三区兴隆信用合作社发放了四千多万元硫铵和麻籽饼贷款，使当地农民在夏锄期间能施上足够的肥料。
