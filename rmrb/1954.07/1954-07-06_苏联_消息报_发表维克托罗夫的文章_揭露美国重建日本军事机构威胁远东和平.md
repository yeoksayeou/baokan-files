Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 5th:

    Soviet "Izvestia" published Viktorov's article - "The Remilitarization of Japan is a Threat to Peace in the Far East," commenting on the entry into force on July 1 of two new Japanese rearmament laws.

    The author points out that with the entry into force of these two new laws, the Japanese military institutions that have been rebuilt in recent years have finally acquired the scale of a modern regular army. The most important feature of these two new laws is that they change the mission of the Japanese armed forces. On July 1, Japan formally and publicly announced that the mission of its army is no longer limited to "maintaining domestic peace and order," but will be expanded to "countering external aggression." This clearly proves that the Yoshida government intends to pave the way for the use of Japanese troops abroad.

    It should be pointed out that, due to the Japanese people's firm opposition to the ruling group's militarist preparations, the Yoshida government declared at the recent Diet session that the Japanese army "will not be sent abroad." However, it would be naive to think that this guarantee is serious. The history of the Japanese army, which has been cultivated and armed by the United States and is under the control of American military advisers, shows that this army has been assigned to play the role of an attacking force in the new imperialist adventures of the United States against the peace-loving people of Asia and the Far East. If the warmongering ruling group in the United States, which is preparing for a third world war, places its main hope on the German imperialist army in Europe, then in Asia they place this hope on the Japanese army.

    Viktorov said: Japanese militarists, who have not abandoned their revanchist illusions, regard the army that is being built as a tool for realizing their plunderous plans. He also pointed out that the establishment of a modern regular army in Japan is in direct conflict with the Japanese constitution, which prohibits rearmament, and is a gross violation of various post-war agreements between major powers. This is exactly how Japanese public opinion views the Yoshida government's current measures.

    Viktorov concluded by writing: Japan's recent militarist measures cannot but cause concern among peace-loving people all over the world. The United States has opened a "smooth road" for Japanese militarists and revived Japan's military machine. This is a serious danger and once again exposes the US ruling group's aggressive plans for Asia.

### 苏联“消息报”发表维克托罗夫的文章  揭露美国重建日本军事机构威胁远东和平

    苏联“消息报”发表维克托罗夫的文章
    揭露美国重建日本军事机构威胁远东和平
    【新华社五日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科四日讯：
  “消息报”发表维克托罗夫的文章——“日本重新军国主义化是远东和平的威胁”，评论七月一日日本两个新的重整军备法的生效。
    作者指出：随着这两个新法的生效，最近几年来重建的日本军事机构已最后具备了现代正规军的规模。这两个新法的最重要特点就是改变了日本武装力量的任务。七月一日日本正式和公开地宣布：它的军队的任务已不只限于“维持国内和平和秩序”，而要扩大到“反击外部侵略”。这就十分明显地证明，吉田政府打算为在国外利用日本军队打开道路。
    应当指出，由于日本人民坚决反对统治集团的军国主义准备，吉田政府在最近一次国会会议上声明，日本军队“将不会派到国外去”。但是，如果认为这个保证是认真的，那就太天真了。由美国所培植和武装起来并处于美国军事顾问控制下的日本军队组成的历史，就说明了这支军队已被派定要在美国进行反对亚洲和远东爱好和平人民的新的帝国主义冒险时担任攻击力量的角色。如果说在准备第三次世界大战的美国好战的统治集团在欧洲是把主要的希望寄托在德国帝国主义的军队身上，那么在亚洲他们就把这种希望寄托在日本军队身上。
    维克托罗夫说道：没有放弃复仇幻想的日本军国主义分子把正在建立的军队看成是实现自己掠夺计划的工具。他并指出：在日本建立近代化正规军队是和禁止重新武装的日本宪法直接抵触的，并且是对战后大国之间各项协议的粗暴的破坏。日本社会舆论对吉田政府目前各项措施正是这样看的。
    维克托罗夫最后写道：日本最近的各项军国主义措施不能不引起全世界爱好和平人民的不安。美国为日本军国主义分子打开了一条“平坦的大道”，复活了日本的军事机器，这件事情是一个严重的危险，同时再一次暴露了美国统治集团对亚洲的侵略计划。
