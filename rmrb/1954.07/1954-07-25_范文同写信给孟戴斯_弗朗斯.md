    总理先生：根据我在一九五四年五月十日全体会议上以我的政府的名义所作的声明和建议，我荣幸地向您证实在与法国的经济和文化关系中，越南民主共和国政府将遵守下列原则：
    从一个集结区出来的人员，不遭受到该集结区负责当局对他们出境的任何在法律上或事实上的阻难。
    根据停止敌对行动协定，此方或彼方部队撤离的地区内，为工业的公用事业所必需的设备，应予保持。
    财产和企业的所有权应予保护和尊重。
    在规定的此方或彼方部队集结的每一地区内的商业和工业企业，如它们愿意，可继续无阻地进行它们的业务，在这方面，它们可自由选择它们的合作者，获得和无阻地使用为进行业务所必需的动产和不动产，而不应对它们采取立法、行政、税收和司法方面的任何歧视的措施。
    在征购、征用和转让等情况下，法侨的合法利益应予照顾。
    越南民主共和国政府并肯定：它将采取一切必要措施，使法国文化机构得以继续它的工作，它并愿意就这方面可能发生的问题和法兰西共和国政府协商。
    总理先生，请您接受我最高的敬意。
