Unforgettable Gratitude
Wang Chengyuan

On the dawn of May 13th, the tranquil Anju Plain suddenly buzzed with activity. A battle-hardened unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers arrived on this plain of tens of millions of square meters of fertile land to begin building a canal, fulfilling the long-cherished dream of the people here.

The people living on the Anju Plain have always loved this land, and they remember those beautiful springs after liberation. At that time, peach blossoms, pear blossoms, and pink azaleas bloomed everywhere, vying for beauty. Willows along the river swayed in the breeze, and the songs of labor echoed. Rice seedlings sprouted, grew strong, and covered the entire plain like a green carpet. However, people could not forget the disastrous summers. Then, floods erupted, swallowing much of the land. The plain almost turned into an ocean. Every year, three to four million square meters of rice paddies were washed away without yielding any harvest, and even ordinary rice paddies suffered greatly reduced yields. Floods threatened people's lives year after year.

In 1950, the government of the Republic designed a water conservancy project blueprint to fundamentally solve the flood problem here. However, the war of aggression launched by American imperialism destroyed their beautiful hopes.

Now, the water conservancy project blueprint designed by the government of the Republic, the large canal that is two thousand eight hundred and twenty meters long and sixty meters wide, is about to appear on the Anju Plain.

From the beginning, a fervent labor emulation campaign was launched at the construction site. The loudspeakers on each work section continuously broadcast new labor records. On the first day, the highest excavation volume was five cubic meters per person, exceeding the original requirement set by the higher authorities by a factor of two. By noon on the second day, a new record of eight cubic meters appeared. Soon after, it was replaced by an even higher record. A reconnaissance platoon of a certain unit, which collectively earned a special-class merit award for a surprise attack on the command post of the Lee's puppet army south of JinCheng in the 1953 counterattack, created an amazing record of excavating twelve cubic meters per person per day. They completed the entire seven days of work in one and a half days. The regimental leader asked the deputy platoon leader Zhao Shunhe to introduce the experience of creating the new record. He replied, "There is only one experience, that is, when the enemy provokes war, we put all our strength and wisdom into the battlefield; when helping the Korean people with production and construction, we put all our strength and wisdom into labor!" Before coming to Korea, Fu Longbiao had participated in the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project in the motherland. At that time, he excavated seventeen cubic meters of earth per day and made great contributions. Now, he is working on Korean soil again. He thought of the scene on the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project site in the past and also of the happy lives of the people in the Jingjiang area today. His labor enthusiasm was even higher. His excavation achievement reached twenty-one cubic meters per day.

The Korean people also labored alongside the Chinese People's Volunteers. On the first day of construction, all the women of Qingsong-ri entered the construction site with the troops in the rain. Some had their feet swollen with blisters, and some had their shoulders reddened by the pressure, but during breaks, they still gathered to sing for the soldiers. At the end of the workday, when they saw the soldiers taking off their mud-covered coats to wash them themselves, they rushed to wash them for the soldiers. They thought: When the soldiers are at home, how would their mothers and wives take care of them after such a tiring day? Now they have all left their hometowns and are working for us. How can they not get the care they deserve? However, no matter what they said, the soldiers would not let them wash. An Qingyu, the chairman of the Democratic Youth League of the village, who had won the third-class national flag medal on the production front, saw this situation and quietly said a few words to the other women. They began to dance for the soldiers. As the soldiers gathered to watch, another group of women took away the dirty clothes. Under the lamplight, they washed the clothes, dried them, and the next day the soldiers wore clean and comfortable clothes again.

More and more local Korean people came, working and competing with the soldiers. Many young girls worked with the soldiers to carry a basket together, competing with each other. When they separated in the evening, they shook hands with each other, introduced themselves, and the girls said, "We are like brothers and sisters!" Li Nongtai, a six-year-old child from Mashan-ri, also came to the construction site with his mother, carrying soil bit by bit in a small basket. A photojournalist at the construction site asked to take a picture of him alone, but the child pulled the surrounding soldiers to his side and took a picture with them. He said: "My dad has gone to the People's Army. I'll send this picture to him so he can see that I have a lot of CPV uncles."

On the 19th, the project was about to end, and almost all the men, women, and children from nearby came to the construction site. The huge labor force, like encircling and annihilating the remaining enemy, rushed to complete the final project in a few hours. When the water slowly flowed through the newly opened canal, everyone could not help but cheer and dance again.

"The East is Red" and "Song of General Kim Il-sung" resonated together, Korean folk harvest dances and Chinese Yangge dances intertwined, and the national flags of China and North Korea fluttered in the wind. The entire construction site was immersed in the boundless excitement and joy of Sino-Korean friendship. At this time, on the work section of a certain unit, a group of CPV soldiers tightly surrounded a white-haired old woman and a child, talking heartily. The old woman bent down, grabbed a handful of clean new soil, wrapped it in a clean silk handkerchief, and told the soldiers, "Four years ago, when the US-Lee bandits occupied this place, all the houses were burned down. At that time, I also wrapped a small package of the scorched black soil left on the foundations. These two small packages are important legacies I leave to my descendants, telling them to never forget their hatred for the enemy and never forget their gratitude to their benefactors..."

The old woman's name is Kim Ui-nyeo, and she is already seventy-three years old. The heinous war of aggression has taken away her old age, which had begun to be happy. Her eldest son was killed by the enemy, her second son was a People's Army soldier and also died heroically, and only a daughter-in-law and this sixteen-year-old grandson are left. Now, looking at this canal that she had been looking forward to for so many years, looking at the clusters of singing and dancing people, looking at these CPV soldiers who had left their motherland to come to Korea to fight and work, she really could not express the happiness in her heart. However, her face immediately turned serious again. She said to the soldiers, "Children, never let the enemy bomb this canal, don't let me hear the sound of bombs again! Let my grandson live a peaceful life, live a good life forever..." The old woman wiped her eyes, paused, and said again, "If the enemy really dares to launch another war of aggression, I will personally send this grandson, my only grandson, to your ranks to eliminate the enemy with you!"

    永远难忘的感激
    王程远
    五月十三号的黎明，沉静的安州平原突然喧闹起来，一支身经百战的志愿军部队来到这个有几千万坪良田的平原上，动工修渠了，他们要实现这里的人民多少年来的宿愿。
    生活在安州平原的人们，永远热爱着这块土地，他们记着解放以后那些美丽的春天。当时，桃花、梨花和粉红色的金达莱花到处争奇斗艳地盛开着，沿河垂柳迎风飘舞着，劳动的歌声荡漾着。禾苗发芽了，茁壮了，绿茵似地遮盖了整个平原。但是，人们更忘不了那多灾多难的夏天，那时，洪水爆发了，很多土地被吞没了，平原几乎变成了海洋，每年都有三四百万坪稻田被冲毁而得不到一点收成，普通的稻田也要大大降低产量，洪水年年在威胁着人们的生活。
    一九五○年，共和国政府设计了一个水利工程蓝图，准备根治这里的水患。可是美帝国主义发动的侵略战争，又破坏了他们美好的愿望。
    现在，共和国政府所设计的那个水利工程蓝图，那个长两千八百二十公尺、宽六十公尺的大水渠，就要在安州平原上出现了。
    一开始，工地上就掀起了火热的劳动竞赛，各个工段上的扩音器里，不断地播送着劳动的新纪录。第一天，最高的出土量每人是五立方公尺，超过了上级原来要求的一倍；到第二天中午，就出现了八立方公尺的新纪录；而不久，又被更高的纪录代替了。在一九五三年金城以南反击战中，因奇袭李伪军团指挥所而集体荣立特等功的某部侦察班，创造了每人每天出土十二立方公尺的惊人成绩，他们在一天半内就全部完成了七天的工程。团首长要副班长赵顺合介绍创造新纪录的经验，他回答说：“经验只有一条，那就是敌人挑起战争的时候，我们就把所有的力量和智慧用在战场上；在帮助朝鲜人民生产建设的时候，我们就把所有的力量和智慧用在劳动上！”傅龙彪在到朝鲜以前，曾参加过祖国的荆江分洪工程，那时他每天挖土十七立方公尺，立了大功。现在，他又在朝鲜的土地上劳动了，他想起了过去荆江分洪工地上的情景，也想起荆江一带人民目前的幸福生活，劳动热情更高了。他的出土成绩，达到了每天二十一立方公尺。
    和志愿军战士一起劳动的还有朝鲜人民。施工的第一天，青松里所有的妇女就和部队一起冒雨进入了工地，她们有的脚叫水泡肿了，有的肩膀叫压红了，可是一休息，她们还是集合起来唱歌给战士们听。收工的时候，她们看到战士们把沾满了泥水的外衣脱下来准备自己去洗时，就争着要给战士们洗。她们想：战士们在家的时候，像这样劳累了一天，他们的母亲、妻子该会是怎么样来照顾他们呀。现在他们都离开了自己的家乡，又在为我们劳动，能让他们得不到应有的照顾吗？可是，她们怎么说，战士们也不肯让她们洗。安庆玉，是里的民主青年同盟的委员长，在生产战线上曾荣获过三级国旗勋章，她看到这种情形，就和别的妇女们悄悄地说了几句话，开始给战士们跳起舞来，谁知道当战士们都围拢上去看时，另外的一群妇女就把那些脏衣服拿走了。在灯光下，她们把衣服洗好，烤干、第二天干净舒适的衣服又穿在战士们身上了。
    当地的朝鲜人民越来越多，他们和战士们一块劳动着，竞赛着。许多年轻的姑娘们，都和战士们打伙抬一个筐子，相互竞赛。晚上分别的时候，他们相互握手，彼此介绍，姑娘们说着：“我们兄妹的一样！”马山里的一个六岁的孩子李农太，也跟着他妈妈来到工地上，用一个小篮一点一点地运土。工地上的摄影记者要求单独给他照个像，孩子却把周围的战士都拉到自己身旁和他一块照。他说：
  “我爸已到人民军去啦，我把这张像片寄给他，让他看看，我的志愿军叔叔大大的有呀。”
    十九号，工程就要结束了，附近的男女老少几乎全都来到了工地上。巨大的劳动大军，好像围歼残余的敌人一样，几小时内就把最后的工程突击完成了。当流水顺着新开的水渠徐徐流过的时候，大家又情不自禁地欢呼舞蹈起来。
    “东方红”和“金日成将军之歌”一起交响着，朝鲜民间的丰收舞和中国的大秧歌舞一起交错着，中朝两国的国旗一起迎风飘舞着，整个工地都浸沉在中朝友谊的无边兴奋和欢乐里。这时，在某部的工段上，一群志愿军战士紧紧地围着一位白发苍苍的老妈妈和一个孩子，纵情地交谈着。那位老妈妈弯腰抓起一撮干净的新土，包在洁白的丝制手绢里，告诉战士们说：“四年前，美李匪军侵占了这里的时候，房子全被烧毁了，那时我把房基上留下的焦黑的土也包了一小包。这两个小包就是我留给后代的重要遗产，叫他们永远忘不了对敌人的仇恨，也永远忘不了对恩人的感激……。”
    这位老妈妈叫金义女，已经七十三岁了。罪恶的侵略战争，夺去了他开始有了幸福的晚年。她的大儿子被敌人杀害了，二儿子是人民军战士，也英勇地牺牲了，跟前只剩下一个儿媳妇和这个十六岁的孙子。现在，她看着这条盼望了多少年的水渠，看着一簇簇歌舞的人群，看着这些离开祖国来到朝鲜而战斗而劳动的志愿军战士们，她实在不能表达自己内心的高兴。可是，他的脸孔马上又变得严肃起来。她对战士们说：“孩子，可千万别让敌人把这条水渠炸坏了，别让我再听见那炸弹的叫唤声！叫我这孙子平平安安地干一辈子活，过一辈子好日子……。”老妈妈擦了擦眼睛，停了一下又说：“要是敌人真的敢再发动侵略战争，我要把这个孙子，唯一的一个孙子，亲自送到自己的队伍里，和你们一起去消灭敌人！”（附图片）
