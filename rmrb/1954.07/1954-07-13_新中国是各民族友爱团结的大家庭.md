The New China is a Big Family of Love and Unity for All Nationalities
Mao Aohai

I.

The founding of the New China has opened a new era in our country's history, namely, the era of national equality has replaced the era of national oppression. The preamble of the recently announced Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China states:
“The nationalities of our country have already united into a free and equal big family of nationalities.” This reflects the new national relations that have emerged since the establishment of the New China more than four years ago.

The General Program of the Draft Constitution provides: "The People's Republic of China, relying on state organs and social forces, through socialist industrialisation and socialist transformation, ensures the gradual elimination of the system of exploitation and the establishment of a socialist society." This reflects the common aspirations of all nationalities in our country to build a new life. Stalin said: “If private ownership and capital inevitably separate people, ignite national disputes, and strengthen national oppression; then collective ownership and labour will inevitably bring people closer, destroy national disputes, and eliminate national oppression. The existence of capitalism without national oppression is inconceivable; similarly, the existence of socialism without the liberation of oppressed nations and without national freedom is also inconceivable.” ("The Party's Urgent Tasks Regarding the National Question") There is no doubt that in the process of striving to gradually transition to a socialist society, the New China will gradually eliminate the roots of all national divisions and consolidate the love and unity of all nationalities a hundredfold.

For more than four years, the Chinese Communist Party has correctly implemented the general task in the transitional period regarding the national question, which is: to consolidate the unification of the motherland and the unity of all nationalities, and jointly build the big family of the motherland; within the unified big family of the motherland, to guarantee the equality of all rights of all nationalities and implement national regional autonomy; in the common cause of building the motherland, to gradually develop the politics, economy, and culture of all nationalities, gradually eliminate the de facto inequality between nationalities historically left behind, enable backward nationalities to enter the ranks of advanced nationalities, and gradually transition to a socialist society. Therefore, our country's national work has achieved significant accomplishments. Now our country has achieved complete national independence and unification, and the people of all nationalities are closely united in a free and equal big family. For example, Tibet, which was previously oppressed by imperialist aggressive forces and formed a state of separation from the motherland, has been forever freed from the shackles of imperialism and has returned to the embrace of the motherland. This is a victory for the Tibetan people and also a victory for all the Chinese people.

The General Program of the Draft Constitution provides: "The People's Republic of China is a unified multi-ethnic state." This affirms the actual situation of the past four years since the founding of the country and also expresses the common will of all nationalities. Our country has dozens of minority nationalities, all of whom are unified and united in an equal, loving, mutually assisting, and cooperative national big family. This kind of unification is greatly beneficial to the political, economic, and cultural development of all minority nationalities. The people of all minority nationalities in our country have deeply realized through years of revolutionary struggle that: only under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, and by closely uniting with the Han people, can there be a happy life for all nationalities; only by promoting love and mutual assistance among all nationalities, jointly opposing imperialism, opposing the people's enemies within all nationalities, opposing great Han chauvinism and local nationalism, and continuing to strengthen the brotherly friendship and unity among all nationalities, can we consolidate and defend the fruits of revolutionary victory.

The General Program of the Draft Constitution provides: "All national autonomous areas are inseparable parts of the People's Republic of China." This provision fully conforms to the interests of all nationalities, and it is based on a solid foundation of national equality and freedom, with the right to be masters of their own affairs. The General Program of the Draft Constitution provides: "All nationalities are equal. Discrimination and oppression against any nationality are prohibited, and acts undermining the unity of nationalities are prohibited. All nationalities have the freedom to develop their own languages and writing systems, and have the freedom to maintain or reform their customs and religious beliefs. Regional autonomy is practised in areas where minority nationalities live in concentrated communities." This not only fully guarantees the equal rights of all minority nationalities, but also consolidates the unification of the motherland. This demonstrates the superiority of our socialist type of constitution, which cannot be compared with the constitution of any capitalist country.

II.

Chapter II, Section 5 of the Draft Constitution makes specific provisions for the autonomous organs of national autonomous areas. This section codifies and develops the basic principles of the policy of national regional autonomy in the Common Program in the Draft Constitution. According to the provisions of the Draft Constitution, in areas where minority nationalities live in concentrated communities, autonomous regions, autonomous prefectures, and autonomous counties shall be established separately under the unified leadership of the Central People's Government, and national autonomous organs shall be established. The national autonomous organs exercise the power of autonomy within the limits of their authority as prescribed by the Constitution and the law. That is to say, manage local finances within the limits of authority prescribed by law; organize local public security forces in accordance with the national military system; and formulate autonomous regulations and separate regulations in accordance with the political, economic, and cultural characteristics of the local nationalities. These regulations shall have legal effect after being submitted to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress for approval. The form of the autonomous organs may be prescribed in accordance with the wishes of the majority of the people of the nationality implementing regional autonomy. This fully guarantees that the autonomous rights of every minority nationality with a concentrated residential area are not violated.

In Old China, the Kuomintang reactionary rulers deprived minority nationalities of their autonomous rights and did not allow them to establish autonomous organs or exercise autonomous power. In contrast, the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao have consistently advocated that minority nationalities should have autonomous rights. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Party's tasks regarding the national question during the transition period also stipulated the policy of national regional autonomy. According to this policy, all minority nationalities have obtained the right to be masters of their own affairs. By the end of May 1954, 58 national autonomous areas above the county level had been established throughout the country. These autonomous areas are all closely united under the unified leadership of the Central People's Government in the big family of love and cooperation among all nationalities in the New China, and are jointly striving to build the New China.

Practice across the country has proven the superiority of the policy of national regional autonomy and proven that it is indeed the key to solving our country's national problems. After the implementation of national regional autonomy, the patriotic spirit and enthusiasm of the people of all nationalities have been universally strengthened, the unity between and within all nationalities has been strengthened, the ties between autonomous organs and the people have been tightened, and the political, economic, and cultural development of all minority nationalities has been gradually promoted.

Currently, the work of establishing autonomous regions throughout the country is still continuing. The autonomous regions that have already been established have all made progress and development to varying degrees. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, which was established the earliest and has developed relatively quickly, can best illustrate this issue. In the past, Inner Mongolia's production was very backward, but now it has greatly developed. In terms of agriculture, the total grain output of the entire region in 1952 exceeded the highest annual output before liberation by 25%. In terms of animal husbandry, the number of livestock in 1953 was double that of 1947. In the past, Inner Mongolia had no industry, but now it has begun to have several modern industrial constructions. In 1954 alone, there were 45 newly built and expanded local state-owned factories, and this year the state's investment in the autonomous region's local state-owned industry exceeded four times that of last year. Due to the development of production, people's purchasing power increased nearly fourfold in the four years from 1947 to 1951. In the past, during the era of reactionary rule, national culture was severely devastated, and more than 90% of the Mongolian people were illiterate. Now there are more than 3,700 primary schools and 30 secondary technical schools, and for the first time there are institutions of higher learning (currently three). In the seven years since the establishment of the autonomous region, the number of children enrolled in schools has reached more than 60% of the school-age children, and more than 30,000 cadres have been trained. In the past, diseases were rampant and the population decreased sharply. Now, due to the development of health and medical work, the population has not only stopped declining but has also begun to rise.

III.

For more than four years, the state has vigorously promoted national regional autonomy on the one hand, and strived to gradually eliminate the de facto inequality between nationalities historically left behind on the other hand. Under the oppression and exploitation of years of reactionary rule, the politics, economy, and culture of all minority nationalities have generally been relatively backward, and some minority nationalities still live a semi-primitive life. Therefore, without the long-term selfless assistance of advanced fraternal nationalities, it would not be easy for them to develop and progress rapidly. Chairman Mao pointed out as early as 1945 in his report "On the Coalition Government": "Communists... must help the broad masses of the various minority nationalities, including all leaders who are connected with the masses, to strive for their political, economic, and cultural liberation and development." Therefore, developing the political, economic, cultural, and other undertakings of all minority nationalities, raising them to the level of advanced nationalities, and gradually transitioning to a socialist society is an extremely important task. After the founding of the New China, the Common Program stipulated helping all minority nationalities develop their political, economic, and cultural undertakings. Now, the Draft Constitution has also affirmed this policy. Chapter II of the Draft Constitution provides: State organs at higher levels shall fully guarantee that the autonomous organs of all autonomous regions, autonomous prefectures, and autonomous counties exercise their power of autonomy, and shall assist all minority nationalities in developing political, economic, and cultural construction. This further guarantees the development of all minority nationalities.

In recent years, thanks to the vigorous leadership and assistance of the Party and the People's Government, and due to the unity and increased awareness of the people of all minority nationalities, all national autonomous regions and national concentrated residential areas across the country have generally made progress and development to varying degrees. In terms of agriculture: In the minority nationality areas, according to surveys, the Yi Autonomous Region in Liangshan, Xikang, the Tibetan Autonomous Region in Xikang Province, the Mengzi, Simao, and Lijiang special districts in Yunnan, and the minority nationality people in many large mountainous areas in Guizhou Province still use wooden farm tools, and only a few areas have five or six households sharing a hoe. Therefore, to develop agricultural production, it is necessary to improve production tools and increase productivity. To this end, the Central People's Government alone allocated 78.8 billion yuan in special funds for agricultural tools in the southwest region in 1953 and 1954. And the southwest region alone manufactured more than 1 million pieces of agricultural tools in 1953 and distributed them to the people of all nationalities free of charge. Due to the improvement of production tools, the productivity of farmers of all nationalities has increased. According to incomplete statistics from the Tibetan Autonomous Region in Deqin County, Yunnan Province, and the Tibetan Autonomous Region in Xikang Province, a total of more than 11,800 mu of cultivated land was expanded in 1953. In terms of animal husbandry: Before liberation, livestock production in the northwest region declined and decreased. Now, livestock production in the northwest has greatly developed. In the three years after liberation, livestock production in Qinghai increased by 20%, and in Xinjiang it increased by 18%. In terms of industry, there was almost none in the minority nationality areas in the past. Now, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has more than 200 large and small factories, the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Region in Jilin has 13 larger factories, and Xinjiang has also begun to have local modern industries. With the construction of industry, the transportation industry in minority nationality areas is also developing. In 1953, minority nationality areas accounted for 57% of the more than 5,000 kilometres of highways built throughout the country.

With the development of various production undertakings, the cultural, educational, and health undertakings of minority nationalities have also developed. Since the founding of the New China, in addition to the establishment of the Central Institute for Nationalities in Beijing, some large regions and provinces have established institutes for nationalities and schools for national cadres, and have trained a large number of national cadres. According to statistics in 1953, including those trained in the past, there were already about 100,000 minority nationality cadres who had left production throughout the country (excluding minority nationality cadres in the military). Dozens of minority nationalities with a population of about 40 million in our country have their own national cadres. School education in various national regions has also developed. For example, the number of middle school students and normal school students of minority nationalities in the southwest region has now increased by 41% and 70% respectively compared with the past. At the beginning of liberation, the Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Region had only 47 primary schools, but by 1952 it had increased to more than 1,690. In the past, minority nationalities rarely published books and periodicals in their own languages. After liberation, our country published 372 types of books in Mongolian, Tibetan, Uyghur, Kazakh, and other national languages in 1952 alone, with approximately 4.39 million copies. Many minority nationality areas also have newspapers in their own national languages. In addition, the state is also actively creating conditions to prepare for the creation of writing systems for minority nationalities that do not yet have them. The literature, art, film, and broadcasting undertakings of minority nationalities have also developed considerably.

In the past, venereal diseases, malaria, other infectious diseases, and obstetrics and gynaecology were relatively prevalent in minority nationality areas, so the population decline of various minority nationalities was extremely serious. For example, in the Altay Special District of Xinjiang, there were more than 5,000 Mongolian households 20 or 30 years ago, but now there are only 600 households left. After liberation, in order to change this historical disaster of population decline, the Party and the People's Government vigorously carried out medical and health work in minority nationality areas. By August 1951, there were 94 health institutions and 24 hospitals that were newly built or restored specifically for minority nationalities. Last year, the state allocated more than 227 billion yuan in subsidies for minority nationality health undertakings, more than double that of the previous year. This has greatly reduced the incidence of various diseases among minority nationalities.

IV.

In addition to national autonomous regions and national concentrated residential areas, minority nationalities scattered in various regions of our country also enjoy equality in all rights. The "Decision on Guaranteeing the National Equal Rights of All Scattered Minority Nationalities" promulgated by the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government in 1952 fully guaranteed the religious beliefs, customs, and civil rights of scattered minority nationalities. Scattered minority nationalities were the most discriminated against in the past, but now they fully enjoy national equal rights and have the right to participate in the work of the people's governments at all relevant levels. They are given special consideration during elections. For example, Article 30 of the Election Law stipulates: "All scattered minority nationalities shall participate in the election of representatives to people's congresses at all levels. The number of representatives to be elected shall be based on the population ratio. The number of people represented by each of their representatives may be less than the number of people represented by each representative to the local people's congress, but generally shall not be less than one-half." In this way, they fully enjoy the equal right to participate in the management of state affairs. In the past, they were forced to conceal their national identity, but now the number of people who recognize their national identity is increasing.

In addition, minority nationalities that were on the verge of extinction and had been forgotten—such as the Oroqen, Bonan, and Yakut—have now obtained the opportunity to redevelop. The Oroqen nationality with a concentrated residential area has established an autonomous region equivalent to a county level, manages its own internal affairs, and has begun to exercise the right to be masters of its own affairs.

V.

In summary, for more than four years, the political, economic, cultural, and other undertakings of the people of all minority nationalities in our country have developed to varying degrees; the majority of minority nationalities with concentrated residence have implemented regional autonomy; and minority nationalities scattered in various regions have enjoyed equality in all rights. These great achievements could only have occurred under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government. In Old China, the status of all nationalities was unequal, and there was no unity among all nationalities. The long-standing system of national oppression created a relationship of mutual discrimination and even mutual killings among the nationalities of China. By the time of the Kuomintang reactionary rule, the people's enemy Chiang Kai-shek even denied that China was a multi-ethnic country. Chairman Mao pointed out in 1945 in "On the Coalition Government" that the Kuomintang's reactionary policies had led to the destruction of the unity of the nationalities of China. The Chinese Communist Party is completely the opposite of the reactionary rulers of the past. It firmly opposes the policy of national oppression, advocates the policy of national equality, advocates that all nationalities within China are equal, and strives for the unity of all nationalities in China on an equal basis into a democratic, free, loving, and united big family.

As early as the First Revolutionary Civil War, the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong cultivated a group of revolutionary backbone forces for some minority nationalities. During the Second Revolutionary Civil War, they also led many minority nationalities to carry out revolutionary struggles. For example, the Soviet government of more than ten counties along the Zuojiang and Youjiang rivers was established in the Zhuang area of Guangxi; when the Red Army passed through many minority nationality areas in Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, Xikang, Gansu, and Ningxia during the Long March, it sowed the seeds of revolution. The "Boba Itewa Government" (meaning the Tibetan People's Government) established in Xikang at that time was established under the leadership and assistance of the Party. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Communist Party organized and led the anti-Japanese national united front of all nationalities in China. For example, in North China, it organized and led the Hui Detachment headed by Ma Benzai, and persisted in the arduous guerrilla warfare there. In addition, it also held an Institute for Nationalities in Yan'an to train revolutionary cadres from all nationalities such as Mongolian, Hui, Tibetan, Miao, and Yi. During the Third Revolutionary Civil War, the Communist Party again led the people of all nationalities in China to carry out a victorious war of liberation against the reactionary rule of Kuomintang Chiang Kai-shek and to expel the aggressive forces of US imperialism. The revolutionary movements in various minority nationality areas also developed on an unprecedented scale under the leadership and assistance of the Party. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Government, established on May 1, 1947, was established on the basis of the upsurge of the Inner Mongolia people's revolutionary movement and under the leadership and assistance of the Party. The revolutionary movement of the Uyghur, Kazakh, and other nationalities in the Ili, Tacheng, and Altay regions of Xinjiang, which began in 1944, against the Kuomintang's national oppression, was also consolidated and developed during the Liberation War.

The history of more than 30 years has proven that the Chinese Communist Party is the true representative of the interests of the people of all nationalities in China. It has consistently strived to eliminate the system of national oppression and to establish a big family of love and unity among all nationalities.

Now, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government, our motherland has victoriously carried out large-scale struggles such as reforming the land system, resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and restoring the national economy. Since 1953, it has also entered a period of planned economic construction. The people of all nationalities in our country are striving for the socialist industrialization of the motherland and for a gradual transition to a socialist society. Under the guidance of the general tasks of the state during the transition period, the nationalities of our country have further consolidated the relationship of love, unity, and mutual assistance. As the Draft Constitution says: "The nationalities of our country have already united into a free and equal big family of nationalities." This is a victorious record of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao in using Marxism-Leninism to solve the national problems of China. There is no doubt that our Draft Constitution will be enthusiastically supported by all minority nationalities and will become their great banner for fighting for a new life.

Let the people of all our nationalities advance towards a prosperous and happy socialist society under the leadership of the Communist Party!

    新中国是各民族友爱团结的大家庭
    茂敖海
    一
    新中国的建立，在我国历史上开辟了一个新的时代，即由民族压迫时代进入了民族平等时代。最近公布的中华人民共和国宪法草案的序言中说：
  “我国各民族已经团结成为一个自由平等的民族大家庭。”这是反映了新中国建立四年多以来所出现的新的民族关系。
    宪法草案总纲规定：“中华人民共和国依靠国家机关和社会力量，通过社会主义工业化和社会主义改造，保证逐步消灭剥削制度，建立社会主义社会。”这反映了我国各族人民建设新生活的共同愿望。斯大林说：“如果私有制和资本势必离散人们，燃起民族的纷争，加强民族的压迫；那末集体所有制和劳动就势必使人们接近，摧毁民族的纷争，消灭民族的压迫。资本主义的存在，没有民族的压迫，是不可思议的；同样，社会主义的存在，没有被压迫民族的解放，没有民族的自由，也是不可思议的。”（“论党在民族问题方面的迫切任务”）毫无疑问，在为逐步过渡到社会主义社会而奋斗的过程中，新中国将逐渐消灭一切民族分歧的根源，百倍巩固各民族的友爱团结。
    四年多以来，中国共产党正确地执行了在过渡时期民族问题方面的总任务，这就是：巩固祖国的统一和各民族的团结，共同建设祖国的大家庭；在统一的祖国大家庭内，保障各民族一切权利的平等，实行民族区域自治；在建设祖国的共同事业中，逐步地发展各民族的政治、经济和文化，逐步地消灭历史上遗留下来的各民族间事实上的不平等，使落后民族能进入先进民族之行列，逐步过渡到社会主义社会。因此，我国民族工作获得了重大的成就，现在我国已经实现了国家的完全独立和统一，各民族人民都紧密地团结在自由平等的大家庭里。例如过去受帝国主义侵略势力压迫，和祖国形成了分离状态的西藏，已永远摆脱了帝国主义的羁绊，回到祖国的怀抱。这是西藏人民的胜利，也是全中国人民的胜利。
    宪法草案总纲规定：“中华人民共和国是统一的多民族的国家。”这肯定了建国四年多来的实际情况，也表达了各民族的共同意志。我们国家有几十个少数民族，他们都统一团结在平等、友爱、互助、合作的民族大家庭里。这种统一对于各少数民族政治、经济、文化的发展有很大好处。我国各少数民族人民在多少年来的革命斗争中深深体会到：只有在共产党和人民政府领导下，和汉族人民紧密地团结起来，才能有各民族的幸福生活；只有发扬各民族间的友爱互助，共同反对帝国主义、反对各民族内部的人民公敌、反对大民族主义和地方民族主义，继续加强各民族间兄弟般的友谊和团结，才能巩固地保卫革命胜利的果实。
    宪法草案总纲规定：“各民族自治地方都是中华人民共和国不可分离的部分。”这种规定完全符合于各民族的利益，它是建立在民族平等自由，有当家作主权利的巩固基础上的。宪法草案总纲规定：“各民族一律平等。禁止对任何民族的歧视和压迫，禁止破坏各民族团结的行为。各民族都有发展自己的语言文字的自由，都有保持或者改革自己的风俗习惯和宗教信仰的自由。各少数民族聚居的地方实行区域自治。”这就不仅充分保障了各少数民族的平等权利，同时也巩固了祖国的统一。这表明我们社会主义类型的宪法的优越性，它是任何资本主义国家宪法所不能比拟的。
    二
    宪法草案第二章第五节，对于民族自治地方的自治机关，作了专门的规定。这一节把共同纲领上的民族区域自治政策的基本原则，在宪法草案上固定下来并加以发展了。根据宪法草案的规定，各少数民族聚居的地方，在中央人民政府统一领导下，分别建立自治区、自治州、自治县，设立民族自治机关。各民族自治机关按照宪法和法律规定的权限行使自治权。这就是说，按照法律规定的权限管理地方的财政；按照国家的军事制度组织本地方的公安部队；按照当地民族的政治、经济和文化的特点，制定自治条例和单行条例。这些条例在报请全国人民代表大会常务委员会批准后，就发生法律效力。自治机关的形式，可以按照实行区域自治的民族大多数人民的意愿规定。这就充分地保障了每个有聚居区的少数民族的自治权利不受侵犯。
    在旧中国，国民党反动统治者剥夺了少数民族的自治权利，不容许他们建立自治机关，行使自治权。与此相反，中国共产党和毛主席一贯主张少数民族应有自治权利。在中华人民共和国成立以后，党在过渡时期的民族问题方面的任务中，也规定了民族区域自治政策。根据这一政策，各少数民族都获得了当家作主的权利。到一九五四年五月底为止，全国已建立了五十八个县级以上的民族自治区。这些自治区都在中央人民政府统一领导下，亲密无间的团结在新中国各民族友爱合作的大家庭中，共同为建设新中国而奋斗。
    全国各地的实践证明了民族区域自治政策的优越性，证明了它确是解决我国民族问题的钥匙。民族区域自治实行后，普遍加强了各民族人民的爱国主义精神和积极性，加强了各民族间和各民族内部的团结，密切了自治机关同人民之间的联系，逐渐促进了各少数民族政治、经济、文化的发展。
    现在，全国各地建立自治区的工作还在继续进行。已经建立起来的自治区都有不同程度的发展和进步。以成立最早、发展较快的内蒙古自治区为例，可以最好地说明这个问题。过去内蒙古生产十分落后，现在大大地发展起来了。在农业方面，一九五二年全区粮食总产量就比解放前的最高年产量超过了百分之二十五。在牧业方面，牲畜头数到一九五三年比一九四七年增加了一倍。过去内蒙古没有什么工业，现在已开始有了若干现代化的工业建设，仅在一九五四年新建和扩建的地方国营工厂就有四十五座，今年国家对自治区地方国营工业的投资超过了去年的四倍以上。由于生产的发展，人民购买力从一九四七年到一九五一年的四年间提高了将近四倍。过去在反动统治时代，民族文化受到了极严重的摧残，蒙族人民百分之九十以上都是文盲。现在已有了三千七百多所小学和三十所中等技术学校，并且头一次有了高等学校（现有三所）。自治区成立七年来，入学儿童已达到学龄儿童的百分之六十以上，另外还培养了三万多名干部。过去疾病蔓延，人口急剧减少，现在由于卫生医疗工作的开展，人口不仅停止下降，而且开始上升。
    三
    四年多来国家一方面大力推行民族区域自治，一方面为逐步消灭历史上遗留下来的各民族间事实上的不平等而奋斗。在多年的反动统治的压迫和剥削下，各少数民族的政治、经济、文化，一般都比较落后，有的少数民族还过着半原始的生活。因此，如果没有先进兄弟民族进行长期的无私的帮助，他们不易迅速发展和进步。毛主席早在一九四五年的“论联合政府”的报告中就指出：“共产党人……必须帮助各少数民族的广大人民群众，包括一切联系群众的领袖人物在内，争取他们在政治上、经济上、文化上的解放和发展”。因此，发展各少数民族的政治、经济、文化等事业，使他们提高到先进民族的水平，逐步过渡到社会主义社会，这是一件极其重要的任务。新中国成立后，共同纲领中就规定了帮助各少数民族发展政治、经济和文化等事业，现在，宪法草案上又把这一政策肯定下来了。宪法草案第二章规定：各上级国家机关应当充分保障各自治区、自治州、自治县的自治机关行使自治权，并且帮助各少数民族发展政治、经济和文化的建设事业。这就进一步保障了各少数民族的发展。
    几年来，经过党和人民政府的大力领导和帮助，并由于各少数民族人民的团结和觉悟提高，全国各民族自治区和民族聚居区，一般都有了不同程度的进步和发展。在农业方面：各少数民族地区中，据调查，西康凉山彝族自治区、西康省藏族自治区，云南的蒙自、思茅、丽江等专区和贵州省很多大山区的少数民族人民，仍然使用着木质农具，只有少数地区五、六户农民才能合用一把锄头。因此，要发展农业生产，必须改进生产工具，提高生产力。为此，中央人民政府只在一九五三年和一九五四年间拨给西南的农具专款就达七八八亿。而西南只在一九五三年就制造了一百多万件农具，无偿地发给了各族人民。由于生产工具的改进，各族农民的生产力提高了。据云南省德钦县藏族自治区和西康省藏族自治区不完全的统计，一九五三年共扩大耕地面积一万一千八百多亩。在牧业方面：解放前西北区牧畜业生产日益衰落下降。现在，西北的牧畜业大大发展起来了。在解放后的三年中，青海牲畜增产百分之二十，新疆增产百分之十八。在工业方面，各少数民族地区过去几乎没有。现在，内蒙古自治区已有大小工厂二百多个，吉林延边朝鲜族自治区较大的工厂有十三个，新疆也开始有了当地的现代化的工业。随着工业的建设，少数民族地区的交通事业也在发展，在一九五三年全国修建的五千多公里公路中，少数民族地区就占了百分之五十七。
    随着各项生产事业的发展，少数民族的文化教育卫生事业也发展起来了。新中国成立以来，除北京已成立中央民族学院外，某些大区及省区都建立了民族学院和民族干部学校，大批培养了民族干部。据一九五三年统计，连以前所培养的在内，全国已有十万名左右的脱离生产的少数民族干部（不包括军队中的少数民族干部）。我国约近四千万人口的数十个少数民族都有了自己民族的干部。各民族地区的学校教育也有了发展。如西南区少数民族的中学生和师范生现在比过去也分别增加了百分之四十一和百分之七十。湘西苗族自治区在解放初只有四十七所小学，到一九五二年就增加到一千六百九十多所。过去少数民族极少用自己文字出版书刊。解放后，我国只在一九五二年就用蒙、藏、维、哈等民族文字出版了三百七十二种书籍，约四百三十九万册。许多少数民族地区也有了本民族文字的报纸。此外，国家也正在积极创造条件，准备为还没有文字的少数民族创造文字。少数民族的文学、艺术、电影、广播等事业也有了相当的发展。
    过去少数民族地区比较普遍地流行着性病、疟疾、其他传染病及妇儿科等病，因而各少数民族人口减少的状况极端严重。如新疆阿勒泰专区二、三十年前原有蒙族五千余户，现在只剩六百余户。解放后，党和人民政府为了改变这历史上遗留下来的人口下降的灾难，在少数民族地区大力开展了医疗卫生工作，到一九五一年八月止，专为少数民族恢复和新建的卫生机构就有九十四所，医院二十四所。去年国家拨给少数民族卫生事业补助费达两千二百七十多亿元，比前年增加了一倍多。这样就大大减少了少数民族的各种疾病。
    四
    除了民族自治区和民族聚居区外，我国各地区散居的少数民族也享受着一切权利方面的平等。中央人民政府政务院在一九五二年颁布的“关于保障一切散居的少数民族成份享有民族平等权利的决定”，充分保障了散居少数民族的宗教信仰、风俗习惯和公民权利。散居少数民族在过去是最受歧视的，现在已完全享有民族平等权利，有权参加有关各级人民政府的工作。在选举时对他们更有特别照顾，例如选举法第三十条规定：“一切散居的少数民族成份，均参加各级人民代表大会代表的选举，应选代表名额以人口比例为基础，其每一代表所代表的人口数，得少于当地人民代表大会每一代表所代表的人口数，但一般不得少于二分之一。”这样他们就充分享受了参加管理国家事务的平等权利。在过去他们被逼迫隐瞒自己的民族成份，现在承认自己民族成份的人日益增加起来了。
    此外，已将灭亡和被遗忘了的少数民族——如鄂伦春、保安、雅库特等族，现在已获得了重新发展的机会。有聚居区的鄂伦春族已建了相当于县级的自治区，自己管理自己的内部事务，开始行使当家做主的权利。

    综上所述，四年多来，我国各少数民族人民的政治、经济、文化等事业都有了不同程度的发展；聚居的少数民族大多数都已实行区域自治；散居的少数民族都已享受了一切权利方面的平等。这些伟大的成就只有在中国共产党和中央人民政府领导下，才能够出现。在旧中国各民族的地位是不平等的，各民族间是不团结的。长期存在的民族压迫制度，造成了中国各民族间互相歧视甚至互相仇杀的关系。到国民党反动统治时期，人民公敌蒋介石甚至否认中国是一个多民族的国家。毛主席在一九四五年“论联合政府”里曾指出，国民党的反动政策，招致了中国各民族团结的破坏。中国共产党则与过去的反动统治者完全相反，坚决反对民族压迫政策，主张民族平等政策，主张中国境内各民族一律平等，并为中国各民族在平等的基础上团结成为一个民主、自由、友爱、团结的大家庭而奋斗。
    远在第一次国内革命战争时期，中国共产党和毛泽东同志即为一些少数民族培养了一批革命骨干。在第二次国内革命战争时期又领导了很多少数民族人民进行了革命斗争。例如在广西僮族地区建立了左右江十余个县的苏维埃政府；在红军长征路经云南、贵州、四川、西康、甘肃、宁夏许多少数民族地区时，撒播了革命的种子，当时在西康成立的“博巴伊特瓦政府”（意即藏族人民政府），就是在党的领导和帮助之下建立的。在抗日战争时期，共产党则组织和领导了中国各族人民的抗日民族统一战线。例如在华北地区曾组织和领导了以马本斋为首的回民支队，坚持了当地的艰苦的游击战争。此外还在延安举办民族学院培养了蒙、回、藏、苗、彝等各族的革命干部。第三次国内革命战争时期，共产党又领导中国各族人民，为反对国民党蒋介石的反动统治，驱逐美帝国主义侵略势力，进行了胜利的解放战争。各少数民族地区的革命运动，在党的领导和帮助下，也以空前未有的规模开展起来。一九四七年五月一日成立的内蒙古自治区人民政府，就是在内蒙古人民革命运动高涨的基础上，在党的领导和帮助之下成立的。从一九四四年就开始的新疆伊犁、塔城、阿山三区维、哈等族人民反对国民党的民族压迫的革命运动，在解放战争中也得到了巩固和发展。
    三十多年来的历史证明了：中国共产党是中国各民族人民利益的真正代表者，它一贯为消灭民族压迫制度，为建立各民族友爱团结的大家庭而奋斗。
    现在，我们祖国在中国共产党和中央人民政府领导下已经胜利地进行了改革土地制度、抗美援朝、镇压反革命分子、恢复国民经济等大规模的斗争，从一九五三年起又进入了有计划的经济建设时期。我国各族人民正在为祖国的社会主义工业化、为逐步过渡到社会主义社会而奋斗。我国各民族在国家过渡时期的总任务指导之下，已经进一步巩固了友爱、团结和互助的关系。正如宪法草案所说：“我国各民族已经团结成为一个自由平等的民族大家庭。”这是中国共产党、毛主席运用马克思列宁主义解决中国民族问题的胜利记录。毫无疑问，我们的宪法草案将得到各少数民族的热烈拥护，成为他们为新生活而斗争的伟大旗帜。
    让我们各族人民在共产党领导下向繁荣幸福的社会主义社会前进！
