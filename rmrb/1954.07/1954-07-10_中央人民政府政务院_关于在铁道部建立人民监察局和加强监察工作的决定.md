    The Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government
    Decision on Establishing a People's Supervision Bureau in the Ministry of Railways and Strengthening Supervision Work
  (Passed at the 219th Government Administration Council Meeting on June 24, 1954)
    Our country has entered the second year of the First Five-Year Plan for economic construction. The railway transportation sector must continuously improve its operation and management and increase its transportation capacity to meet the growing transportation needs of industrial and agricultural production, commodity circulation, and the people's material and cultural life, as well as to meet national defense needs. Establishing and strengthening the supervision system in the railway sector is an effective way to ensure the completion of the above tasks. Since the establishment of the People's Supervision Offices in the railway system in 1953, they have played a certain role in further promoting and improving railway operation and management, but they have not been able to achieve comprehensive and systematic supervision and inspection. The Harbin Railway Auditing Bureau, based on the original China Changchun Railway auditing work system, has for several years carried out struggles against violations of law and discipline, against corruption and waste, and against damage to state property, and has made significant achievements in supervising all business units of the entire railway to complete production and financial plans, increase revenue, practice thrift, and abide by financial discipline. In order to universally promote this successful experience throughout the national railway system, it is decided to establish a People's Supervision Bureau in the Ministry of Railways to strengthen supervision work. The original People's Supervision Offices and auditing institutions in the financial and accounting systems at all levels under the Ministry of Railways should be abolished immediately.
    The People's Supervision Bureau of the Ministry of Railways is under the dual leadership of the People's Supervision Committee of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government and the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government, with the People's Supervision Committee of the Government Administration Council as the primary leader. The supervisory bodies at all levels below the Ministry of Railways are directly led by the People's Supervision Bureau of the Ministry of Railways.
    At the same time, the Work Regulations of the People's Supervision Bureau of the Ministry of Railways are approved. The Ministry of Railways should immediately begin to establish People's Supervision organizations and carry out work in accordance with the decision.

    中央人民政府政务院
    关于在铁道部建立人民监察局和加强监察工作的决定
  （一九五四年六月二十四日政务院第二百一十九次政务会议通过）
    我国已进入第一个五年经济建设计划的第二年，铁路运输部门必须不断地改善经营管理，提高运输能力，以满足工农业生产、商品流通和人民物质文化生活日益增长的运输需要，并满足国防需要。建立和加强铁道部门的监察工作制度，则是保证完成上述任务的有效方法之一。一九五三年铁道系统建立人民监察室以来，虽对于进一步推动和改进铁路经营管理工作，起了一定作用，但尚未能做到全面的系统的监督和检查。哈尔滨铁路稽核局在原中长铁路稽核工作制度的基础上，几年来开展了反对违法乱纪、反对贪污浪费和反对损害国家资财等现象的斗争，在监督全路一切业务单位完成生产财务计划，增加收入，厉行节约，遵守财务纪律等方面，做出了显著的成绩。为了把这一成功的经验，在全国铁道系统中普遍推行，决定在铁道部建立人民监察局，以加强监察工作。铁道部原各级人民监察室和财务会计系统的稽核机构，应即撤销。
    铁道部人民监察局受中央人民政府政务院人民监察委员会和中央人民政府铁道部双重领导，并以政务院人民监察委员会为主。铁道部以下的各级监察机构，统归铁道部人民监察局直接领导。
    同时批准铁道部人民监察局工作条例。铁道部应即着手建立人民监察机构，并依决定进行工作。
