Where is the Pentagon dragging Thailand?
    Feng Zhidan

With the efforts of all forces striving to ease international tensions, the possibility of the Geneva Conference restoring peace in Indochina is growing. Following the Sino-Indian and Sino-Burmese talks, friendly relations between Asian countries have further developed. The American ruling group is anxious and uneasy about this, and regardless of its increasingly isolated position, it is stepping up various military and political conspiracies in an attempt to prevent this development trend in Asia.

The recent US-Thai military talks in Washington are part of a series of American conspiracies.

The US Department of Defense issued a statement on the US-Thai military talks, saying that the outcome of the talks led to a "new, additional military plan" for the United States to "aid" Thailand. Thai Deputy Defense Minister Nai Sarit also made no secret of the results of the talks, stating that Thailand will further implement measures to expand its army, and "the number of trained officers and non-commissioned officers in the Thai army will immediately double." Obviously, this kind of military expansion can only be part of the United States' sinister plan to "use Asians to fight Asians," and has nothing in common with Thailand's security and peace interests. United Press International admitted that the US-Thai military talks planned a "base plan" for Thailand to become a base for suppressing national liberation movements in Southeast Asia, and to include some cavalry regiments in the Thai ground forces "to prepare for operations in some mountainous areas on the Thai border," and to "build jet aircraft airfields" so that "jet fighters and light bombers can be ready to take off at any time." According to Agence France-Presse, a squadron of US jet trainers is about to go to Thailand.

The Thai government also felt unable to hide this fact from the people. Thai Prime Minister Luang Phibunsongkhram actually said at a press conference on June 21, "It is very likely that a situation will arise that makes it necessary to take a joint action in Thailand similar to what the United Nations took in Korea." He also stated that Thailand welcomes the United States and its puppet countries' troops to Thailand, and is willing to participate in the Southeast Asian group planned by the United States, to pull chestnuts out of the fire for the United States. Therefore, American propagandists seem to have reason to issue such arguments, such as United Press International said on June 12: "If the United States decides to intervene in Indochina, then even if it does not get the support of other countries, Thailand will follow the United States."

This clearly shows what the recent "appeal" made by Thailand to the United Nations Security Council is all about. It is not that Thailand's security is under any threat, but that Thailand is playing an assigned role, to threaten the possibility of restoring peace in Indochina. Moreover, Thailand is being dragged into war adventures by the United States.

The Thai government's pursuit of American policy has naturally caused unease among the Thai public. The Thai "Honor Newspaper" once sharply asked: "Who are we dragging the war into our homes for, and for what?"

The Thai public can easily find the correct answer for themselves. Especially at this time, the facts have proved that Asian countries are fully capable of maintaining and consolidating peace by promoting friendly relations with each other. The results of the Sino-Indian and Sino-Burmese talks have clearly put forward the five principles of peaceful coexistence between Asian countries. These five principles apply to the entire Asia and to general international relations, and of course, they fully apply to the relations between Thailand and other countries. However, the road that the United States is dragging Thailand onto today is fundamentally contrary to the spirit of these five principles. Thailand's pursuit of American policy is obviously in conflict with Thailand's interests.

In fact, even now, the dire consequences of Thailand's pursuit of American policy are already very obvious.

After World War II, American aggression forces infiltrated Thailand. In October 1950, the United States and Thailand signed a "Military Aid" Agreement, and Thailand's armed forces have been placed under the control of a huge American military aid advisory group. Thailand is also full of military bases and "strategic highways" needed for American aggression interests. The US-Thai "Economic and Technical Cooperation" Agreement signed in the same year opened the way for Wall Street's monopoly capital groups to wantonly plunder Thailand's natural wealth.

The result of Thailand's implementation of military expansion and arms preparation in the past few years has plunged the country's finances and economy into crisis. According to a report by the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East: Since 1950, Thailand's budget deficit "has become a routine." Thailand's fiscal deficit in 1954 reached more than 1.485 billion baht (Thai currency), equivalent to more than 74 million US dollars, an increase of more than 35% compared with the budget deficit in 1953. Moreover, the heavy military expenditure burden has forced Thailand to be heavily indebted. As of August 1953, the domestic and foreign debts of the Thai government were nearly 4 billion baht. People's lives have fallen into poverty. The cost of living index in September 1953 was 18 times the cost of living index before World War II.

The United States' "embargo" policy and control of Thailand's foreign trade have caused the price of rubber, which accounts for 33% of Thailand's total exports, to plummet, and both the export volume and output have continued to decline. Rice, which accounts for more than half of Thailand's total exports, has also "become an increasingly serious problem for Thailand" due to the influence of the "Rice Export Allocation Committee" manipulated by the United States.

From this, it seems that if Thailand continues to pursue American policy, it will obviously not have good results. Today, the situation in Asia has undergone fundamental changes. Asian countries can jointly maintain peace. The Thai people will never be willing to tie their country's fate to the American war chariot. There is no doubt that Thailand can take an independent and autonomous policy at any time and not be dragged to a dead end by the United States.

    五角大楼把泰国拖向何处
    冯之丹
    在一切争取缓和国际紧张局势的力量的努力下，日内瓦会议恢复印度支那和平的可能性日益增长。中印、中缅会谈后，亚洲各国的友好关系有了进一步的发展。美国统治集团对此焦急不安，竟不顾自己日陷孤立的地位，加紧进行各种军事和政治的阴谋活动，妄图阻挡亚洲的这种发展形势。
    最近在华盛顿举行的美泰军事谈判，就是美国一连串阴谋活动的一个部分。
    美国国防部发表了关于美泰军事谈判的声明说：这次会谈的结果导致了美国“援助”泰国的“一个新的，附加的军事计划”。泰国副国防部长乃沙立也毫不掩饰谈判的结果，泰国将进一步实行扩军措施，“泰国军队里受训的军官和士官马上就要增加一倍”。很显然，这种扩军措施只能是美国
  “用亚洲人打亚洲人”的恶毒计划里的东西，而与泰国的安全与和平利益毫无共通之处。合众社就承认说，美泰军事谈判策划了一个使泰国成为镇压东南亚民族解放运动的“基地的计划”，并使泰国地面部队中也包括一些骑兵团，“以准备在泰国边境的一些多山地区作战”，并“建筑喷气式飞机的飞机场”，以便“喷气式战斗机和轻轰炸机可以随时准备出动”。据法新社报道，美国喷气式教练机一个中队即将前往泰国。
    泰国政府也感到无法向人民掩盖这个事实了。泰国总理銮披汶在六月二十一日的记者招待会上居然说，“很有可能产生这样一种情况，使得有必要在泰国采取一种类似联合国在朝鲜所采取的那种联合行动”。他并表示，泰国欢迎美国及其仆从国的军队到泰国去，还愿意参加美国策划中的东南亚集团，替美国火中取栗。因此，美国宣传家就似乎有理由地发出这样的论调，如合众社六月十二日说：“要是美国决定在印度支那进行干涉的话，那么即使得不到其他国家的支持，泰国也将随着美国走”。
    这就清楚地说明了最近泰国向联合国安理会提出的“呼吁”究竟是怎么一回事了。这不是泰国的安全受到什么威胁，而是泰国在充当一种被派定的角色，要使恢复印度支那的和平的可能性受到威胁。并且，泰国正在被美国拖向战争冒险中去了。
    泰国政府这样追随美国的政策，当然不能不在泰国公众中引起不安。泰国“荣誉报”就曾尖锐地问道：“我们要把战争拉到我们家里来，究竟是为了谁，为了什么？”
    泰国公众很容易找到自己的正确答案。特别是在这个时候，事实证明，亚洲各国完全能够用促进相互之间的友好关系，来维护和巩固和平。中印、中缅会谈结果，就已经明确地提出了亚洲各国之间和平共处的五项原则，这五项原则适用于整个亚洲和一般国际关系之中，当然也完全适用于泰国与其他国家之间的关系。但是，美国今天把泰国拖上的道路，正是与这五项原则的精神根本相违背的。泰国追随美国政策的做法，也就显然是与泰国的利益相冲突的。
    事实上，即使是在现在，泰国追随美国所遭到的恶果，也已十分明显的了。
    第二次世界大战以后，美国侵略势力就渗入了泰国。一九五○年十月美泰签订了“军事援助”协定，泰国的武装部队已被置于庞大的美国军事援助顾问团的控制之下，泰国境内并已布满了为美国侵略利益所需要的军事基地和“战略公路”。同年签订的美泰“经济与技术合作”协定，又为华尔街的垄断资本集团对泰国自然财富的恣意掠夺开辟了道路。
    泰国过去几年来实行扩军备战的结果，已使财政经济陷于危机。据联合国亚洲与远东经济委员会的报告披露：自一九五○年起，泰国的预算赤字“已成了常规”，一九五四年度泰国的财政赤字竟达到十四亿八千五百多万铢（泰币），约合七千四百多万美元，较一九五三年的预算赤字又增加了百分之三十五以上。并且，沉重的军费负担迫使泰国负债累累。截至一九五三年八月为止，泰国政府所负内外债务已近四十亿铢。人民生活陷于贫困化，一九五三年九月的生活指数等于第二次世界大战以前的生活指数的十八倍。
    美国的“禁运”政策和对泰国对外贸易的控制，使得占泰国输出总额百分之三十三的橡胶，价格惨跌，输出量和产量都不断降低。占泰国输出总额一半以上的大米，也由于受到美国操纵下的“大米输出分配委员会”的影响，已“成为泰国愈来愈严重的问题。”
    由此看来，如果泰国继续追随美国政策下去，那显然是不会有什么好结果的。今天亚洲形势已发生了根本的改变，亚洲各国可以共同维护和平，泰国人民决不会愿意把自己国家的命运绑在美国的战车上。毫无疑问，泰国是随时都可以采取独立自主的政策，不被美国拖向绝路的。
