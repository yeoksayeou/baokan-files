    Immigrant Work in the Foziling Reservoir Flood Storage Area Successfully Completed
    The Qianhe Sluice Project in Anhui Province Successfully Completed
    The immigrant work in the Foziling Reservoir flood storage area in the upper reaches of the Huai River has been successfully completed before the flood season.

    The Foziling Reservoir is located in Huoshan County, Anhui Province. The flood storage area covers twelve townships with a total population of over 10,000. In order to properly resettle the people in the flood storage area and ensure that the reservoir can store floodwaters as planned during this year's flood season, the Huoshan County Committee of the Communist Party of China and relevant units organized an immigration committee starting in November last year. They also dispatched more than 40 cadres to form a work team, which went to various places to assist district and township cadres in carrying out immigration work. After more than seven months of hard work, the resettlement work has been successfully completed. More than 10,000 immigrants have been properly resettled, and have started production in new gardens.

    A total of eight agricultural and forestry production cooperatives and ninety-four year-round mutual aid teams have been organized in the immigrant area, with more than 940 households organized, accounting for more than half of the total number of agricultural households among the immigrants. These organized immigrants built houses, moved, and engaged in production at the same time, ensuring that moving and production were not delayed. Among them, the 38 households in Xinglong Agricultural Cooperative have built 68 houses, opened more than 100 mu of terraced fields, and planted more than 80,000 trees.

    The Qianhe Sluice project in Anhui Province has been successfully completed. The Qianhe Sluice is a key project in the Qianhe River basin, which can prevent the backflow of the Huai River and maintain a certain amount of water in the Yellow River. The completion of this project can protect nearly one million mu of farmland on both sides of the Qianhe River from flooding. At the same time, it can also divert water for irrigation. The Qianhuai District of Huaiyuan County alone can develop 150,000 mu of paddy fields. At present, a pumping station has been set up in the Qianhuai District.

    The entire Qianhe Sluice project includes more than 1,200 cubic meters of reinforced concrete, more than 500 cubic meters of ordinary concrete, and more than 23,000 cubic meters of stone and earthwork. Thanks to the active work of the laborers, the entire project was completed seven days ahead of schedule. (Yang Xiaobin, Ge Yu)

    佛子岭水库蓄洪区移民工作顺利结束
    安徽省芡河闸工程胜利完工
    淮河上游佛子岭水库蓄洪区的移民工作，在汛期前顺利结束。
    佛子岭水库在安徽霍山县境内，蓄洪区范围包括十二个乡，共有居民一万余人。为了妥善安置蓄洪区群众，并保证水库在今年汛期按计划拦蓄洪水，从去年十一月起，中共霍山县委和有关单位便组织了移民委员会，并抽调四十多名干部组成工作队，分赴各地协助区乡干部进行移民工作。经过七个多月的努力，移民安置工作已顺利结束，万余移民大都得到妥善安置，并在新的园地上开始生产。
    移民区共已组织农、林业生产合作社八个，常年互助组九十四个，组织起来的有九百四十多户，占移民中农业总户数一半以上。这些组织起来的移民，边盖房、边搬家、边生产，做到了搬家生产两不误。其中兴隆农业社的三十八户人家，已盖房六十八间、开梯田百余亩、植树八万余株。
    安徽省芡河闸工程已胜利完工。芡河闸是芡河流域的关键工程，它可以防止淮水的倒灌，保持黄河容纳一定水量。这项工程的完成，可以使芡河两岸近一百万亩的农田不再受水灾侵袭。同时还可引水灌溉。仅怀远县芡淮区一个区就可发展十五万亩水田。目前芡淮区已设立抽水站。
    芡河闸全部工程计有钢筋混凝土一千二百多公方，普通混凝土五百多公方，石方和土方二万三千多公方。由于民工的积极工作，全部工程提前七天完工。（杨孝彬　葛昱）
