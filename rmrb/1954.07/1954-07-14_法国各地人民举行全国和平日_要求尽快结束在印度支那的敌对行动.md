    【新华社十三日讯】塔斯社巴黎十二日讯：法国全国各地在十一日纪念全国和平日。这是按照六月十二日和十三日在巴黎举行的争取独立与和平人民大会所作出的决定进行的。法国全国几乎所有的城市和居民区的居民的代表团都访问了他们的议员，市长，省议会议员和市政委员会委员和地方当局的代表，向他们表示法国人民希望保证以和平方式解决所有引起争论的国际问题的坚定不移的愿望。这些代表团坚决要求：政府必须以行动来表达法国人民的这一愿望。
    据“人道报”和“解放报”报道，巴黎的五百多个代表团访问了巴黎的市政委员会，要求废弃波恩和巴黎条约并和印度支那签订一项和平条约。一个由居住在曼尼尔蒙当街的应征入伍者的母亲们组成的代表团说：法国的母亲们决不应当答应把她们的儿子派去和越南人民作战。
    有五十多个代表团访问了加尔省尼姆市市长办公室；有七十个代表团访问了阿尔卑斯滨海省尼斯市市长办公室；此外还有其他地方的一些代表团作了类似的访问。
