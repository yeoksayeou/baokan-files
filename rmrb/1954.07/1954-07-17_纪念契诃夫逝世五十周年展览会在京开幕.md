    The "Exhibition Commemorating the 50th Anniversary of the Death of the Great Russian Writer Chekhov," sponsored by the Preparatory Committee for Commemorating the 50th Anniversary of the Death of World Cultural Figure Chekhov in China, opened on the 15th at the National Beijing Library.

    At 10:00 a.m., Mao Dun, a member of the World Peace Council, cut the ribbon to open the exhibition.

    The exhibition features more than 200 kinds of Chekhov's works, including Russian originals, Chinese translations, and translations in Japanese, French, German, English, Czech, and Finnish. The Chinese translations show that Chekhov's works have been disseminated in China for a long time. Early translations include Bao Tianxiao's translation of the short stories "Ward No. 6" and "Photograph" published in the "Fiction Times" in 1910, and Chen Leng's translation of "A Living" published in "New Youth" in 1918, which recommended "The Seagull," "Uncle Vanya," "The Three Sisters," and "The Cherry Orchard" in the "One Hundred Famous Modern Dramas" section; Zheng Zhenduo's translation of "The Seagull" published in 1921; Qu Qiubai and Geng Jizhi's translation of the collection of short stories "Crime" published in 1924; and Lu Xun's translation and publication of Chekhov's "Bad Boys and Other Stories" in 1936. Also on display are stills from the Xinyou Drama Troupe's 1930 performance of "Uncle Vanya," which was one of the earliest performances of Chekhov's multi-act plays in China. In addition, there are stills from the comedy "The Proposal" performed by the China Youth Art Theatre this year in commemoration of Chekhov.

    The Russian versions on display include the complete works of Chekhov published by A. Marx, a publisher in Petersburg, in 1903, the complete works of Chekhov published by the Book Publishing Department of the People's Commissariat for Education of Soviet Russia in Petrograd in 1918, and the complete works of Chekhov published by the Moscow State Literary Book Publishing House from 1944 onwards.

    The dozens of photographs on display introduce Chekhov's life and works and the performance of his plays in the Soviet Union, enabling viewers to see the brilliant path and great achievements of this great Russian writer throughout his life.
