Xinhua News Agency, Manila, July 9th: Van Fleet, former commander of the U.S. Eighth Army in Korea, who, in the capacity of U.S. President Eisenhower's special envoy, has been engaged in aggressive deployments in the Far East, left Manila on the 8th for U.S. military bases in the Pacific, such as Guam and Honolulu. Van Fleet has been trying to keep the purpose of his activities in Manila secret. However, indications are that his purpose is to gather cannon fodder for the U.S.'s Far East military adventure plans and to incite the Philippine ruling clique to intensify the suppression of the people's liberation movement.

During his three-day stay in the Philippines, Van Fleet held talks with Philippine President Magsaysay and military leaders. The Associated Press reported that Van Fleet's visit to the Philippines was to fully investigate the country's military capabilities in order to report to Eisenhower. He also discussed with the Philippine authorities issues related to the implementation of the "U.S.-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty." Philippine military authorities said that Van Fleet had considered "very sympathetically" what the Philippines needed in carrying out its plans to expand its army.

Van Fleet also expressed concern about the Magsaysay government's suppression of the domestic national liberation movement. On the 7th, he listened to the Philippine military authorities' report on the fighting between the Philippine government army and the Philippine People's Liberation Army.

Philippine Senator Recto, who has repeatedly expressed dissatisfaction with Magsaysay's following of U.S. policy, made a statement through the "Manila Chronicle." He sarcastically said that the relevant Philippine military measures had already been decided at the recent five-nation military conference in Washington; all that remained was to accept the form of the Pentagon's (U.S. Department of Defense) plans.

    为美国军事冒险计划搜罗炮灰
    范佛里特在菲律宾进行活动
    【新华社九日讯】马尼拉消息：以美国总统艾森豪威尔特使的身份到远东从事侵略性部署的前侵朝美军第八军军长范佛里特，八日离开了马尼拉前往关岛和檀香山等太平洋美国军事基地。范佛里特竭力对他这次到马尼拉活动的目的保持秘密。但是，迹象表明，他的目的在于给美国的远东军事冒险计划搜罗炮灰，并鼓动菲律宾统治集团加紧镇压人民解放运动。
    范佛里特在逗留菲律宾三天的期间，曾向菲律宾总统麦格赛赛和军事首脑会谈。美联社说，范佛里特到菲律宾会充分地调查这个国家的军事能力，以便向艾森豪威尔报告，他也曾和菲律宾当局讨论有关执行“美菲联防条约”的问题。菲律宾军事当局说，范佛里特“十分同情地”考虑菲律宾在执行扩充军队的计划方面所需要的东西。
    范佛里特对麦格赛赛政府镇压国内民族解放运动，也表示关心。他在七日听取了菲律宾军事当局向他汇报菲律宾政府军和菲律宾人民解放军作战的情况。
    曾一再对麦格赛赛追随美国政策表示不满的菲律宾参议员雷克托，通过“马尼拉纪事报”发表了谈话。他讽刺地说：有关菲律宾的军事措施已经于最近在华盛顿举行的五国军事会议中作出了决定；留下来的事只有接纳五角大楼（美国国防部）的计划的形式罢了。
