    Religious Circles in the Capital Enthusiastically Discuss the Draft Constitution
    Many Industrial and Commercial Figures Talk About Their Experiences with the Draft Constitution
    Religious circles in the capital have enthusiastically launched discussions on the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China. More than 1,200 people from religious circles, including Islam, Buddhism, Taoism, Catholicism, and Christianity, have participated in the discussions. They have now listened to two reports and held two to three discussions. The discussions have been very enthusiastic, with many old priests, pastors, monks, and Taoists in their sixties and seventies participating. Many Buddhist, Taoist, and Islamic figures living in the suburbs rushed to the city to listen to the reports and attend the meetings. Some lamas who do not understand Chinese bought the Mongolian and Tibetan versions of the Draft Constitution to read.

    Religious figures participating in the discussions unanimously expressed their heartfelt support for the Draft Constitution, especially feeling a sense of closeness to the provisions on citizens' freedom of religious belief. Jinba Jiangcuo, a Tibetan lama from Zifu Temple, said: "During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, we were driven out of the temple, and we had no freedom of person or property. How could there be freedom of belief? Since liberation, we have gained true freedom of belief. Now the Draft Constitution has made a solemn provision, which is even more guaranteed." The lamas of Yonghe Temple saw the Mongolian translation of the Draft Constitution shortly after its promulgation and deeply felt the happiness of ethnic minorities living today. Religious figures participating in the discussions unanimously expressed their desire to conduct more in-depth discussions on the Draft Constitution, raise their patriotic awareness, be vigilant against any sabotage conspiracies by the enemy, and further strengthen their unity with the people of the whole country.

    Many industrial and commercial figures in Beijing who have embarked on the path of joint state-private ownership, in the discussion of the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China, have realized from the profound changes in various aspects of their enterprises before and after the joint state-private ownership that the state capitalist economy stipulated in the Draft Constitution is a correct and bright path for capitalist industry and commerce to accept socialist transformation. They unanimously expressed their willingness to, under the leadership of the working class, support the Draft Constitution with practical actions to further develop production and ensure the completion of the state's production plans.

    Ni Jiaxi, deputy manager of the joint state-private Yili Food Company, recalled the unforgettable scene of his warehouses and transport trucks being unreasonably looted by the Kuomintang bandits before liberation when he read the article in the Draft Constitution stipulating that the means of production and other property of capitalists should be protected by law. In describing the changes in his company before and after the joint state-private ownership, he said: "Under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, Yili Food Company has shifted from blind production to planned production, changed the capitalist mode of operation, and the production enthusiasm of employees has continued to grow, with great development in business. The turnover in the first five months of this year alone has increased more than twenty times compared with the beginning of the joint state-private ownership in 1951, reversing the phenomenon of losing money year after year before the joint state-private ownership." He pointed out that the Shanghai Jiufu Pharmaceutical Factory, Liulanxiang Toothpaste Factory, and Qingdao Jinghua Glass Factory that he operated have also undergone the same significant changes after joint state-private ownership or processing orders for the state. He said: "The road I have experienced has made me deeply realize that only by working hard to create conditions and honestly taking the road of state capitalism in accordance with the provisions of the Draft Constitution can we have a bright future."

    Li Xiude, deputy director and engineer of the joint state-private Xinhua Rubber Factory, talked about the fact that production efficiency improved after the factory's joint state-private ownership: seventeen workers could only produce twenty-eight bolts of rubber cloth per day; now thirteen people can produce thirty-six bolts of rubber cloth per day. He said that the factory has just begun to embark on the road of state capitalism, and will continue to work harder to improve management and contribute some of the technology he understands.

    首都宗教界人士热烈讨论宪法草案
    许多工商界人士谈对宪法草案的体会
    首都宗教界人士热烈展开了中华人民共和国宪法草案的讨论。参加讨论的有伊斯兰教、佛教、道教和天主教、基督教等宗教界人士共一千二百多人。现在他们已分别听了两次报告，进行了两次到三次讨论。讨论中大家情绪很热烈，很多六七十岁的老神甫、牧师、和尚、道士也都参加了。不少住在四郊的佛教、道教、伊斯兰教的人士赶到城里来听报告、参加会议。有些不懂汉文的喇嘛，买了蒙、藏文字的宪法草案来阅读。
    参加讨论的宗教界人士对宪法草案一致表示衷心拥护，特别对宪法草案中关于公民有宗教信仰自由的规定更感亲切。资福院藏族达喇嘛金巴降错说：“国民党反动统治时期，我们被赶出庙外，人身、房产都没自由，还有什么信仰自由呢？解放以来才获得了真正的信仰自由。现在宪法草案又作了庄严的规定，就更有保障了。”雍和宫的喇嘛们在宪法草案公布后不久就看到了蒙文翻译本，深感到少数民族生活在今天的幸福。参加讨论的宗教界人士一致表示要对宪法草案进行更深入的讨论，提高爱国主义觉悟，警惕敌人的任何破坏阴谋，进一步加强和全国人民的团结。（新华社）
    北京市许多已走上公私合营道路的工商界人士在中华人民共和国宪法草案的讨论中，从本企业公私合营前后各方面的深刻变化中，体会到宪法草案所规定的国家资本主义经济是资本主义工商业接受社会主义改造的一条正确的光明的道路。他们一致表示要在工人阶级领导下，以进一步发展生产、保证完成国家生产计划的实际行动来拥护宪法草案。
    公私合营义利食品公司副经理倪家玺看了宪法草案规定的依照法律保护资本家的生产资料所有权和其他财产所有权的条文，回想起解放前自己的仓库和运输卡车被国民党匪帮无理劫掠的难忘的情景。他在叙述他的公司在公私合营前后的变化时说：“义利食品公司公私合营三年多来，在共产党和人民政府的领导下，已从过去的盲目生产走上计划生产，改变了资本主义的经营方式，职工生产情绪也不断增长，业务得到很大发展。仅今年前五个月的营业额就比一九五一年刚开始公私合营时增加二十倍以上，扭转了公私合营前年年赔钱的现象。”他指出他所经营的上海九福制药厂、留兰香牙膏厂和青岛晶华玻璃厂公私合营或为国家加工订货后，也发生了同样的显著变化。他说：“我自己经历过的道路，使我深深体验到，只有照着宪法草案的规定，努力创造条件，老老实实走国家资本主义的道路，才有光明前途。”
    公私合营新华橡胶厂副厂长兼工程师李秀德谈到这个工厂公私合营后生产效率提高的事实：从前十七个工人每天只能生产二十八匹胶布；现在十三个人每天就能生产三十六匹胶布。他说，厂还是刚开始走上国家资本主义道路，今后还要加倍努力改进经营管理，贡献出自己所懂得的一些技术。
