Guangdong Finance Department
Actively Organizes Farmers to Produce Rosin

    Guangdong's financial and economic departments are actively organizing farmers to produce rosin in order to ensure the supply of export goods and meet the needs of domestic industry.

    Guangdong Province is the main rosin producing area in China. In the past, due to the lack of leadership and attention to rosin production by local departments, the output of rosin was not large. In early May this year, the Guangdong Provincial Department of Commerce of the People's Government, the Guangdong Branch of China Native Produce Company and other units organized the Guangdong Provincial Rosin Production Work Team to go deep into the five major rosin producing areas to mobilize farmers to actively collect rosin. After extensively publicizing the significance of rosin production to national construction and the country's rational price policy to farmers, the vast majority of farmers have begun to take action. The number of contracts signed by farmers and state-owned companies in Xingning, Meixian and other seven counties has exceeded the original plan by 9%.

    广东省财经部门
    积极组织农民生产松香
    广东省财经部门积极组织农民生产松香，以保证出口货源和国内工业的需要。
    广东省是我国的松香主要产区。过去由于当地有关部门对松香生产领导和重视不够，松香产量不大。今年五月上旬，广东省人民政府商业厅、中国土产公司广东省公司等单位组织广东省松香生产工作队，深入到五个松香主要产区，动员农民积极采割松香。经过向农民广泛宣传了生产松香对国家建设的意义和国家的合理的价格政策以后，广大农民已开始行动起来。兴宁、梅县等七个县的农民和国营公司签订合同的份数，已超过了原计划百分之九。
