    Shanxi Province Farmers Strive for a Bumper Harvest of Autumn Crops
    Southern Jiangxi Province's Seventeen Counties Expect Early Rice Harvest
    Since the beginning of summer, rainfall has been sufficient in various parts of Shanxi, and various autumn crops are generally growing well. Currently, in the cotton-producing areas of southern Shanxi, cotton seedlings are about a foot tall and have begun to branch and bud. Corn and sorghum in the Taihang Mountains and central Shanxi are already more than half a person tall. Seedlings of various grains in various regions, as well as hemp in the Changzhi area, flax and potatoes in the Yanbei area, are all growing vigorously.
    The vast number of farmers in Shanxi Province are working hard to cultivate, weed, irrigate, and apply top dressing to strive for a bumper harvest. Agricultural technicians from the 473 technical extension base stations scattered throughout the province are teaching farmers various summer operation techniques. At present, cotton farmers in southern Shanxi, after weeding three to four times, are starting to prune. Corn and sorghum in the Taihang Mountains and other areas are undergoing second cultivation and top dressing. Other grains, flax, are being thinned or starting their first cultivation.
    After entering the summer operation period, farmers in various parts of Shanxi have been fighting various natural disasters. Farmers in various regions have launched a campaign to check and replant seedlings in response to the problem of missing seedlings after drought-resistant planting, ensuring full stands. In PingShun and other seventeen counties alone, 47 agricultural production cooperatives and 142 mutual aid teams have transplanted 6,500 mu and more than 174,000 seedlings. Subsequently, farmers in various regions have been fighting various insect pests in conjunction with thinning and weeding. Currently, cotton aphids have been basically eradicated. Various regions are also actively carrying out drainage and flood control projects, preparing a large number of late autumn crop seeds, preparing to fight possible mountain floods and hailstorms.

    Millions of mu of early rice in seventeen counties in southern Jiangxi Province are expected to have a bumper harvest. From Guidong County in Hunan Province along the Xianggan Highway eastward, passing through Chongyi, Shangyou and other counties to Ganxian, and then by car eastward from Ganxian to the areas south of Ruijin and Shicheng counties bordering Fujian Province, the endless early rice fields are mostly nearing maturity. Farmers in Dayu, Xinfeng, Longnan, Qiannan, Dingnan, Anyuan, Xunwu and other eleven counties with earlier harvest seasons have started harvesting since late June. Farmers in Ruijin, Shicheng, Xingguo, Ningdu, Yudu, and Huichang six counties with later seasons planting “Nante No.,” “Wushizao,” and “Bairizao” have also begun harvesting in late June. According to relevant estimates, if there are no particularly serious unexpected natural disasters in the next half month, the early rice in the southern Jiangxi Province this year will increase by about 7 to 10 percent compared to last year. The 79.9 mu of early rice planted by the Third Agricultural Production Cooperative of Jibu Township, Ganxian County, in this area are lush and strong, with rice seedlings generally reaching about four feet tall. According to the recent field comparison results among the members, it is believed that each mu of land can yield an average of at least 550 jin of rice, an increase of more than 20 percent compared to when it was still a mutual aid team last year.

    山西省农民争取大秋作物丰产
    江西省南部十七个县的早稻丰收在望
    入夏以来，山西各地雨量充足，各种大秋作物普遍生长良好。现在，山西南部产棉区棉苗已有尺许，开始分枝结蕾。太行山区和山西中部一带的玉米，高粱都有半人多高。各地谷苗和长治专区的麻、雁北专区的胡麻、马铃薯等幼苗，都很茁壮。
    山西省广大农民正紧张地进行中耕、除虫、灌溉和施追肥以争取丰收。分散在全省各地的四百七十三个技术推广基点站的农业技术人员，正向农民传授各种夏季作业的技术。目前，山西南部植棉的农民们在普遍锄了三次到四次草后，开始打杈；太行等地的玉米、高粱正进行二锄和追肥；其它谷类及胡麻，都在间苗或开始头锄。
    进入夏季作业后，山西各地农民向各种自然灾害进行了斗争。各地农民曾针对抗旱播种后的缺苗现象，开展了查苗补苗运动，保证了全苗。仅平顺等十七县的四十七个农业生产合作社和一百四十二个互助组，就移苗六千五百多亩又十七万四千多株。接着，各地农民又结合间苗、锄草和各种虫害进行斗争，目前棉蚜已基本扑灭。各地还积极进行排水、防洪等工程，备妥大批晚秋作物种籽，准备和可能发生的山洪、冰雹灾斗争。　（据新华社讯）
    江西省南部地区十七个县的几百万亩早稻丰收在望。从湖南省境内的桂东县沿湘赣公路东上，经过崇义、上犹等县到赣县，再由赣县乘汽车东上直到和福建省接壤的瑞金、石城等县以南地区，一眼望不到边的早稻大部已近黄熟。收获季节较早的大庾、信丰、龙南、虔南、定南、安远、寻邬等十一个县，有些农民已自六月下旬起开镰收割。季节较迟的瑞金、石城、兴国、宁都、雩都、会昌六县种植
  “南特号”“五十早”“百日早”的农民，也已在六月下旬开始收割。据有关方面估计，最近半个月内如果没有特别严重的意外自然灾害发生，今年江西省南部地区的早稻将比去年增产百分之七到一成左右。这个地区的赣县吉埠乡第三农业生产合作社种植的七十九亩九分早稻茂密茁壮，稻秧普遍高达四尺左右。社员们最近在田间评比结果，认为每亩田平均至少可收五百五十斤稻谷，约比去年还是互助组的时候增产两成以上。　（新华社）
