　　Xinhua News Agency, 20th dispatch: The United States Plots to Use "Foreign Aid" Appropriations to Intensify its Policy of Aggression Against Our Country.
　　The United States Senate Foreign Relations Committee submitted a formal report to the Senate on the "Foreign Aid" plan on the 16th. The report shows that the American aggressive clique is prepared to use so-called "foreign aid" appropriations to intensify its policy of aggression against the Far East, especially against China.
　　In its report, the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee emphasized the importance of strengthening military and economic "aid" to the Chiang Kai-shek bandits and using Taiwan as a military base for aggression against the Chinese mainland. The report said that Taiwan is a "key point" on the American "defense line" (i.e., the "encirclement" of New China) in the Pacific from Japan to the Philippines. The report emphasized that the U.S. is spending money to support the remnant army of Chiang Kai-shek in Taiwan to "constantly threaten the Chinese mainland."
　　The report also stated that the United States' intervention in the Indochina War failed and that it should "redouble its efforts to establish an effective Southeast Asia collective security system." It particularly emphasized that if a truce is achieved in Indochina, giving so-called aid to anti-communist puppets in Southeast Asia "will be even more important."

    美国图谋利用“援外”拨款
    加紧推行对我国的侵略政策
    【新华社二十日讯】美国参议院外交委员会十六日就“援外”计划向参议院提出了一个正式报告。报告表明：美国侵略集团准备利用所谓“援外”拨款来加紧推行对远东特别是对中国的侵略政策。
    美国参议院外交委员会在它的报告里，强调加强对蒋匪的军事和经济“援助”及利用台湾作为侵略中国大陆的军事基地的重要性。报告说，台湾是美国在太平洋上从日本到菲律宾的“防线”（按即对新中国的“包围圈”）上的“要点”。报告强调指出：美国出钱豢养台湾蒋介石的残余军队，“对中国大陆发出不断的威胁”。
    报告同时表示，美国干涉印度支那战争失败，应“加倍地加强努力来建立有效的东南亚集体安全体系”。它特别强调，如果印度支那实现了停战，给予东南亚反共傀儡的所谓援助“就更为重要”。
