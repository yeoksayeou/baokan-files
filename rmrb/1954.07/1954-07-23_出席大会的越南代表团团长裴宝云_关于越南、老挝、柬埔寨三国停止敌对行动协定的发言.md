    Today, first of all, please allow me, on behalf of the Vietnamese delegation, to extend cordial congratulations to all delegates and the delegations of all countries present, and wish you good health.
    As we are meeting, we have received the news that the Geneva Conference has signed the agreement on the cessation of hostilities in Indochina, and the news that our country's diplomatic struggle has achieved further victory. Our Vietnamese delegation is extremely happy because this is the sincere wish of the Vietnamese people. This victory was achieved through a long and arduous struggle of seven or eight years under the wise leadership of President Ho, the Lao Dong Party, and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. At the same time, it was also achieved due to the victory of the struggle of the peace-defending movement led by the Soviet Union. The Vietnamese people, like the Khmer and Lao people, deeply realize that the achievement of the agreement on the cessation of hostilities is due to the support of peace-loving people, especially the support of the French people, and is the result of the efforts of fraternal countries, especially the Soviet Union and China. The victory of the Geneva Conference is only the first step for us, the Vietnamese people. The Vietnamese people should constantly heighten their vigilance to prevent the American interventionists' conspiracy to sabotage the agreement and their aggressive ambitions. At present, the task of the Vietnamese people is to realize genuine independence, unity, democracy, and peace. The Vietnamese people always remember President Ho's teaching that the struggle ahead is still complex, difficult, arduous, and long-term. However, the Vietnamese people will always trust the wise leadership of President Ho, the Lao Dong Party, and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and trust the strength of the peaceful and democratic camp headed by the powerful Soviet Union. Because of this trust, no matter what difficulties we encounter, we will surely be able to overcome them.
    Comrades, this victory is great. Our Vietnamese people will advance to strive for the rights of independence and democracy for the Vietnamese people. For the world people's cause of peace, it has increased and consolidated the strength of peace and democracy; conversely, it is a heavy blow to the enemy, to the American interventionists who are conspiring to expand the Vietnam war, and to the elements in France who are conspiring to launch and expand the Indochina war.
    This victory cannot be described and expressed in a few brief words.
    Finally, I wish the conference success!

    出席大会的越南代表团团长裴宝云
    关于越南、老挝、柬埔寨三国停止敌对行动协定的发言
    今天，首先请让我代表越南代表团向全体代表们和到会各国代表团致以亲切的祝贺，祝同志们健康。
    正在我们开会的时候，得到了日内瓦会议关于在印度支那停止敌对行动的协定已经签字的消息，得到了我国的外交斗争已获得了进一步的胜利的消息，我们越南代表团感到无限的高兴，因为这是越南人民的恳切愿望。这一胜利是在胡主席、劳动党和越南民主共和国政府的英明领导下经过七、八年长期艰苦的斗争得来的，同时这也是由于以苏联为首的保卫和平运动的斗争的胜利而取得的。越南人民和高棉、寮国人民一样，对停止敌对行动协定的达成，都深深认识到这是由于爱好和平人民的支持，特别是法国人民的支持，这是由于各兄弟国家特别是苏联和中国的努力的结果。日内瓦会议的胜利，对我越南人民来说，这只是第一步，越南人民还应该经常提高警惕以防止美国干涉者破坏协定的阴谋和侵略野心。目前越南人民的任务是实现真正的独立、统一、民主和和平。越南人民经常记住胡主席的教导，那就是今后的斗争仍然是复杂的、困难的、艰苦长期的。但是，越南人民永远信任胡主席、劳动党和越南民主共和国政府的英明领导，信任以强大苏联为首的和平民主阵营的力量，由于这种信任，不管遇到什么困难，也一定都能克服的。
    同志们，这种胜利是伟大的，我们越南人民将进而为越南人民争取独立、民主的权利，对世界人民和平事业来说，它已增加和巩固了和平民主的力量；相反地，对于敌人、对于美国干涉者阴谋扩大越南战争来说，对于法国阴谋发动和扩大印度支那战争的分子来说，是一个沉重的打击。
    这一胜利，不是我们几句简短的字句所能形容和表达出来的。
    最后，祝大会成功！
