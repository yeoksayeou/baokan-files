More Than Eighty Construction Units in Shenyang
    Determined to Reduce Costs by More Than 60 Billion Yuan
    [This newspaper's dispatch] More than eighty construction units in Shenyang City, in accordance with the state's cost reduction requirements for 1954, have separately determined cost reduction targets of 5% to 10%. Among them, thirty-nine units, based on their experiences in saving last year and this year's project conditions, have formulated specific savings plans from the aspects of saving building materials, improving labor productivity, maximizing the utilization rate of mechanical equipment, reducing transportation costs, and administrative expenses. Units such as the Fourth Work Zone of the Northeast Sixth Engineering Company and the Seventh Construction Site of the Nonferrous Metals Industry Bureau's Second Engineering Company, after formulating their plans, mobilized the masses for discussion, making the plans more advanced and realistic.
    Currently, according to the cost reduction targets determined by more than eighty units, savings have reached more than 60 billion yuan. If this saved capital is used for construction, it could build two modern factory buildings with an area of 15,000 square meters each, or build more than forty three-story staff dormitories with an area of 1,500 square meters each, which can accommodate more than 10,000 employees. If it were used to buy cloth, it could buy 15 million chi [Chinese foot = 1/3 meter], and if calculated at 18 chi per person, it could provide more than 900,000 people with a new set of clothes.
    [Another Dispatch] The employees of the Seventh Construction Site of the Nonferrous Metals Industry Bureau's Second Engineering Company have generally formulated specific savings plans on the basis of ensuring project quality, in order to save more than 1.1 billion yuan of wealth for the country.
    After receiving education on savings, all employees of the construction site have realized the great significance of accumulating funds for the country's socialist construction. Therefore, the savings plans formulated by the workers are very specific and reliable. For example, after attending a savings mobilization meeting, the workers in Hao Xingzhi's formwork carpentry group spent more than ten evenings in discussion. Everyone reviewed the past waste of formwork and came up with many savings methods such as using the advanced experience of parallel formwork, utilizing old and waste materials, and rationally using wood. They formulated a specific savings plan to save 53 cubic meters of wood (worth more than 80 million yuan) during construction. Wang Qinshan's bricklaying group also formulated a plan to ensure no waste of mortar, cement, and red bricks, saving the country 10 million yuan. Now, the employees of the Seventh Construction Site are working hard to realize their plans.

    沈阳八十多个建筑单位
    确定降低成本六百多亿元
    【本报讯】沈阳市有八十多个建筑单位按照一九五四年国家规定的降低成本要求，分别确定了降低成本百分之五到百分之十的降低成本指标。其中有三十九个单位根据去年的节约经验和今年的工程情况，从节约建筑材料、提高劳动生产率、发挥机械设备运用率、降低运输费用和行政管理费等方面订出了具体的节约计划。东北第六工程公司第四工区、有色金属工业管理局第二工程公司第七工地等单位，订出计划后又发动群众进行了讨论，使计划更先进更切合实际。
    现在根据八十多个单位确定的降低成本指标已达六百多亿元。如把将来节约的这笔资金用在建设上，可建筑两座一万五千平方公尺的现代化工厂场房，或建筑每幢一千五百平方公尺的三层职工宿舍四十多幢，可容一万多名职工居住。如用去买布，就可买一千五百万尺，如按每人十八尺计算，就可供九十多万人都做一套新衣服。
    【又讯】有色金属工业管理局第二工程公司第七工地职工，在保证工程质量的基础上普遍制订了具体的节约计划，要为国家节约十一亿多元的财富。
    工地全体职工经过节约的教育，都认识到为国家积累资金对社会主义建设的重大意义。因此，工人们订出的节约计划都很具体可靠，如支模板的郝兴治木工小组的工人在开完节约动员大会以后，利用了十几个晚上进行讨论，大家检查了过去支模板的浪费现象，想出了运用平行支模法先进经验，利用旧材、废材及合理使用木材的许多节约办法，订出在施工中节约五十三立方公尺木材（价值八千多万元）的具体节约计划。王钦山砌砖小组也订出了保证不浪费砂浆、水泥、红砖为国家节约一千万元的计划。现在七工地的职工正在为实现自己的计划而努力。
