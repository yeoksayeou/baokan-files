Xinhua News Agency, 19th: The People's Bank of China recently allocated 350 billion yuan in loans, in coordination with relevant departments, to support farmers in flood-stricken areas in overcoming disasters and restoring production. These loans are mainly provided to farmers to purchase production tools and buy food and seeds. Many banks in disaster-stricken areas have transferred cadres to rural areas with funds, and simplified the issuance procedures so that loans can be quickly distributed to farmers. In areas where the floods have receded, many farmers have used bank loans to buy seeds to replant seedlings and other miscellaneous grains.

Some credit cooperatives in disaster-stricken areas also cooperate with bank loans, using existing funds to help farmers overcome the difficulties caused by the disaster. The Gaochang, Yangjia, and Hexin Township Credit Cooperatives in Jingjiang County, Hubei Province, loaned more than 21 million yuan to 183 farmers to help them rescue more than 2,100 mu of flooded fields. The Tushan Township Credit Cooperative in Xuancheng County, Anhui Province, loaned more than 6 million yuan to its members to purchase Jiang rice seeds and seedlings for timely replanting.

    支援水灾区农民战胜灾害和恢复生产
    人民银行拨出贷款三千五百亿元
    【新华社十九日讯】中国人民银行最近拨出贷款三千五百亿元，配合各有关部门，支援遭受水灾地区的农民战胜灾害和恢复生产。这些贷款主要是贷给农民添置生产工具，购买口粮和种籽。受灾地区的很多银行抽调干部带款下乡，并简化发放手续，使贷款能很快发到农民手中。在洪水已经退落的地区，不少农民用银行贷款买了种籽补种秧苗和其他杂粮。
    有些受灾地区的信用合作社也配合银行贷款，运用现有资金，帮助农民克服灾害所带来的困难。湖北省荆江县高厂乡、杨家乡、合新乡三个信用合作社贷款二千一百多万元给一百八十三户农民，帮助他们抢救了二千一百多亩水淹田。安徽省宣城县土山乡信用合作社贷款六百多万元给社员购买江稻种和秧苗，及时补种。
