We must strive to overfulfill the production plan and do a good job in our current work to support the Chinese People's Liberation Army, accelerate the modernization of national defense, and fight for the liberation of our sacred territory Taiwan and the elimination of the Chiang Kai-shek remnant bandit gang. Li Weiguang, Director of the East China General Branch of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, said at the meeting: The Chinese people must liberate Taiwan, and our Taiwan compatriots must return to the free and happy embrace of the motherland.
