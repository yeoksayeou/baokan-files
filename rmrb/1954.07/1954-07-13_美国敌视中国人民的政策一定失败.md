    The convening of the Geneva Conference has brought about an increasing demand for the establishment of normal relations between countries, as international consultations have unfolded. This is particularly evident in the growing number of countries seeking to establish normal relations with the People's Republic of China and to restore and promote economic and cultural exchanges. This trend, which aligns with the interests of all nations and the aspirations of their people, is irresistible.
    However, the U.S. ruling clique still refuses to acknowledge reality and continues to pursue a policy of hostility towards the People's Republic of China and creating tension in Asia, attempting to resist the desire of all nations to normalize international relations. Recently, the U.S. war-monger Van Fleet conducted conspiratorial activities in the Far East, openly declaring that the U.S. would sign a "mutual security bilateral treaty" with the remnant Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in Taiwan. At the same time, a group of reactionary U.S. congressmen, driven to irrationality by their hostility towards the People's Republic of China, such as Nolan and McCarran, clamored against the People's Republic of China obtaining its legitimate seat in the United Nations. The purpose of these conspiratorial activities is obviously to stifle the current wave of calls for improved relations between countries, in order to exacerbate tensions in Asia and the world.
    The tense state of Sino-U.S. relations today is entirely the result of the U.S. ruling clique's unwillingness to abandon its completely bankrupt policy of dominating China and monopolizing Asia.
    The history of Sino-U.S. relations over the past century has been filled with the U.S. imperialism's crimes of aggression against China. After World War II, the U.S. ruling clique harbored unprecedented and wild ambitions to invade China. It used the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang as a tool to launch a civil war in China, attempting to seize from the Chinese people the victorious fruits of the great national liberation struggle against Japanese fascism, turning China into a U.S. colony, and using Chinese territory and manpower to launch a war of aggression against the Soviet Union.
    The plan to destroy China put forward by the war-monger Wedemeyer, who came to China in September 1947 on the orders of the U.S. President to conduct an "investigation," openly stated that the U.S. should use military aid to establish the "stable position" of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, driving it to "fight" against the Chinese people's revolutionary forces, "developing along lines satisfactory to the United States," turning China into an "important U.S. air base, as a deployment area for bombing attacks, and an important naval base along the Asian seaports." At the same time, Wedemeyer even demanded "trusteeship" of Northeast China, shamelessly saying: "A unified China, friendly to or allied with the United States, would not only provide important air and naval bases, but, from the point of view of its territory and manpower, would be an important ally of the United States."
    Wedemeyer's sinister plan occupies an important part in the "White Paper on Sino-U.S. Relations" published by the U.S. government in 1949. This White Paper made an unavoidable confession of the U.S.'s entire crime against the Chinese people. The White Paper confessed: "The unfortunate but unavoidable fact is that the unfortunate outcome of the Chinese civil war was beyond the control of the U.S. government." It admitted that the Chinese people's revolution was "the product of internal forces in China, which the United States had attempted to influence but could not effectively."
    The U.S. aggressors failed shamefully. Six billion U.S. dollars and the then-dominant Chiang Kai-shek military forces failed to salvage the U.S.'s failure. The 600 million Chinese people and their vast territory did not become cannon fodder and a base for the U.S. to launch a new world war, but became members of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, becoming a powerful pillar of peace in Asia and the world. The establishment of the People's Republic of China has fundamentally changed the entire situation in Asia, and the colonial system of imperialist enslavement and oppression of the Asian people has begun to collapse.
    At the time of its founding, the People's Republic of China declared to the world: "The principles of the foreign policy of the People's Republic of China are to safeguard the independence, freedom, and integrity of its territory and sovereignty, to uphold enduring international peace and friendly cooperation among the people of all countries, and to oppose the imperialist policy of aggression and war." The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China also sincerely stated: "This government is willing to establish diplomatic relations with any foreign government that is willing to abide by the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect for territorial sovereignty." The policy pursued by our country is fully in line with the principles of international cooperation, and it is also fully in line with the interests of peace in Asia and the world. Therefore, it has received the sympathy and support of peace-loving countries and people all over the world.
    However, the U.S. ruling clique is still unwilling to accept its failure in China, resolutely standing against the Chinese people, and intensifying its policy of aggression and hostility towards the People's Republic of China. The U.S. government stubbornly refuses to recognize the People's Republic of China and coerces its vassal states to follow its absurd policy of "non-recognition," while forcibly inserting the political corpse of the remnant Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang entrenched in Taiwan into China's seat in the United Nations, openly supporting the remnant Chiang Kai-shek group in its struggle, and stepping up the establishment of military bases outside our country's borders to carry out military threats against our country.
    In June 1950, the U.S. brazenly launched the war of aggression against Korea, attempting to further carry out direct armed aggression against the People's Republic of China; at the same time, it also invaded and occupied China's Taiwan Province, using Taiwan as another springboard to prepare for an attack on the Chinese mainland. After the failure of the U.S. war of aggression against Korea, it immediately vigorously interfered in the Indochina War and planned to expand the war to China, carrying out new adventures from China's southern border.
    The U.S. aggressors actually regard their aggression and conspiratorial activities in Taiwan as an important part of their foreign policy of opposing the Chinese people and plotting a new world war. But in international affairs, there is no fact more despised by the world's righteous people and more seriously weakening the U.S.'s international standing and prestige than this.
    The U.S. Seventh Fleet shelters the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang that is despised by the people, and the huge U.S. military delegation used more than one billion U.S. dollars worth of military supplies to reorganize and expand the remnant troops of Chiang Kai-shek. The U.S. military headquarters does not hide their intention to use the Chiang Kai-shek army as a tool to invade the People's Republic of China. The U.S. aggressors have repeatedly directed Chiang's bandits to carry out armed harassment of our country's coastal areas, dispatch and direct special agents from Taiwan to infiltrate our country's mainland to engage in sabotage activities, instigate Chiang's bandits to carry out piratical looting on the high seas, intercept merchant ships of various countries, and rudely disrupt shipping and trade between countries around the world and the Far East. The purpose of all these reckless actions by the U.S. ruling clique is to shake the People's Republic of China, which has stood rock-solidly in the world. No amount of painstaking excuses can conceal the fact that the reason why the U.S. stubbornly opposes it and its allies improving relations with the People's Republic of China is precisely because it refuses to abandon this self-inflicted policy of hostility toward the Chinese people.
    The U.S. policy of aggression and provocation against China completely violates the most basic principles of international law and morality, exposing the U.S. ruling clique as a lawless aggressor and colonialist, attempting to reverse the course of history and establish its colonial rule in Asia and the world. This reactionary policy is not only unacceptable to the Chinese people, but also conflicts with the interests of Asian and world countries, and is also detrimental to the U.S. itself. Therefore, this reactionary policy cannot but repeatedly run into a wall.
    Anyone who is not blind can see that the international status and prestige of the People's Republic of China are rising day by day. It has established unbreakable fraternal relations with the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. The peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union has become so strong that whoever dares to launch a war against it is simply courting death; a new world war would only mean the destruction of the entire capitalist system. Therefore, more and more politicians in capitalist countries are unwilling to follow the U.S.'s policy and want to adopt an independent and autonomous policy. At present, twenty-five countries with a population of more than one billion have already established or are establishing diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China. More countries are restoring and expanding trade and cultural exchanges with the People's Republic of China. Government and parliamentary figures, trade unions, cultural circles, business circles, and representatives from other fields are increasingly coming to visit the People's Republic of China. The relations between the Chinese people and the people of all countries in the world are becoming closer.
    The current situation has undergone new developments. The great significance of the convening of the Geneva Conference lies in the fact that the People's Republic of China participated in the settlement of Asian issues as one of the major powers, declaring that the era in which Asian people could not interfere in their own affairs is gone forever. The position and propositions adopted by the delegation of the People's Republic of China on the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue and the restoration of peace in Indochina are in line with the peaceful interests of Asian and world countries.
    The significant positive impact of the recent Sino-Indian and Sino-Burmese talks is obvious to all. The Prime Ministers of China, India, and Burma unanimously expressed their desire to promote the success of the Geneva Conference on the restoration of peace in Indochina, and declared the five principles for developing mutual relations and applicable to general international relations, which have been widely supported by other countries in the world. British Prime Minister Churchill and Foreign Secretary Eden recently stated, when talking about Britain's policy on Southeast Asian issues, that they agreed with the principle of peaceful coexistence. This clearly shows that the U.S.'s conspiracy to cobble together a Southeast Asian military bloc or a "Northeast Asian Alliance," expand the Indochina War, and create tension in Asia is unpopular. The so-called "Southeast Asian" aggressive bloc has not even received the support of a major Southeast Asian country, and its actual value can be imagined.
    It is no accident that a group of U.S. congressmen who have been advocating hostility towards the People's Republic of China have been so agitated in recent days, and that even the U.S. President and Secretary of State have found it necessary to come out and declare that they will "fight to the last minute" against the People's Republic of China obtaining its legitimate seat in the United Nations. From Asia to Western Europe, Northern Europe, and all the way to the Americas, the voices calling for peace, for recognition of China's international status and legitimate rights, and for easing international tensions have pushed the U.S. ruling clique into a corner.
    Therefore, it is very clear what the consequences will be if the U.S. ruling clique refuses to abandon its policy of hostility towards the People's Republic of China, which has proven unworkable.

    美国敌视中国人民的政策一定失败
    吴全
    日内瓦会议召开以来，随着国际协商的展开，建立各国之间正常关系的要求，也日益高涨起来。它特别突出地表现在：越来越多的国家要求和中华人民共和国建立正常关系，并恢复和促进经济与文化交流。这个符合各国利益和人民愿望的形势发展，是不可抵挡的。
    但是，美国统治集团依然不肯承认现实，继续推行敌视中华人民共和国和在亚洲制造紧张局势的政策，妄想和各国人民要求国际关系正常化的愿望相对抗。最近，美国战争贩子范佛里特到远东进行阴谋活动，公然声称美国要和台湾国民党残余匪帮签订“共同安全双边条约”；同时，美国一群敌视中华人民共和国到了丧失理性地步的反动议员，如诺兰、麦卡伦之流又在大叫大嚷反对中华人民共和国取得在联合国中的合法地位。这些阴谋活动的目的，都显然是为了窒息目前一片要求改善各国关系的呼声，以加剧亚洲和世界的紧张局势。
    中美关系处于今天这样的紧张状态，完全是由于美国统治集团不愿放弃它彻底破产了的统治中国、独霸亚洲的政策的结果。
    近百年的中美关系史，自始至终充满了美国帝国主义对中国的侵略罪行。第二次世界大战之后，美国统治集团更怀抱着空前未有的侵略中国的狂妄野心。它竟假借蒋介石匪帮的手，发动中国内战，妄图从中国人民手中攫取反抗日本法西斯的伟大民族解放斗争的胜利成果，把中国变为美国的殖民地，并利用中国的领土和人力来发动进攻苏联的战争。
    一九四七年九月奉美国总统之命到中国“调查”的战争贩子魏德迈提出的灭华计划，就公然说美国要以军事援助，建立蒋介石匪帮的“稳固地位”，驱使它对中国人民革命力量“作战”，“沿着满足美国的路线发展”，把中国变为美国的“重要空军基地，作为轰炸出击的配备地区，以及沿亚洲海港的重要海军基地”；同时魏德迈竟要求“托管”中国东北，并恬不知耻地说：“一个与美国友好或联盟的统一的中国，则将会不仅仅供给重要的空军和海军基地，并且自它的幅员和人力观点来看，将会是美国的一个重要盟国。”
    魏德迈的这个罪恶计划，在一九四九年美国政府发表的“关于中美关系”的白皮书中，占着重要的部分。这个白皮书对美国整个反对中国人民的罪行，作了无可奈何的供状。白皮书供认：“不幸的但亦无法逃避的事实，是中国内战的不幸结果为美国政府控制所不及。”它承认中国的人民革命是“中国内部势力的产物，这种势力，美国亦曾试图加以影响，但不能有效”。
    美国侵略者可耻地失败了。六十亿美元和当时占优势的蒋介石军事力量没有能够挽救美国的失败。六亿中国人民及其辽阔广大的国土，不是成了美国发动新世界大战的炮灰和基地，而是成了以苏联为首的和平民主阵营的成员，成了亚洲和世界和平的一个有力的支柱。由于中华人民共和国的成立，整个亚洲形势发生了根本的变化，帝国主义奴役和压迫亚洲人民的殖民体系开始崩溃了。
    中华人民共和国成立的时候，就向全世界宣告：“中华人民共和国外交政策的原则，为保障本国独立、自由和领土主权的完整，拥护国际的持久和平和各国人民间的友好合作，反对帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策。”中华人民共和国中央人民政府并且诚恳地表示：“凡愿遵守平等、互利及互相尊重领土主权等项原则的任何外国政府，本政府均愿与之建立外交关系。”我国所奉行的这种政策是完全符合国际合作的原则的，同时也是完全符合亚洲及世界和平的利益的，因而，它得到了全世界爱好和平的国家和人民的同情和支持。
    但是，美国统治集团却仍然不甘心它在中国所遭到的失败，坚决与中国人民为敌，变本加厉地执行侵略和敌视中华人民共和国的政策。美国政府顽固地拒绝承认中华人民共和国，并胁迫它的仆从国追随其荒谬的“不承认”政策，同时竟把盘踞台湾
  一隅的蒋介石残余匪帮的政治僵尸硬塞在联合国中的中国席位上，公开支持蒋介石残余集团进行挣扎，并加紧在我国边境外建立军事基地，来对我国进行武力威胁。
    一九五○年六月，美国悍然发动侵朝战争，妄图进一步向中华人民共和国进行直接的武装侵略；同时并侵占了我国台湾省，把台湾作为准备进攻中国大陆的又一个跳板。美国侵朝战争失败后，随即又大力干涉印度支那战争，并策划把这场战争扩大到中国，从中国的南部边境进行新的冒险。
    美国侵略者居然把它在台湾的侵略和阴谋活动，作为它与中国人民为敌、策划新世界大战的外交政策的重要部分。但在国际事务中，再没有比这个事实最为世界正直人士所不齿，最严重地削弱美国的国际地位和声望的了。
    美国第七舰队庇护着人所唾弃的蒋介石匪帮，庞大的美国军事代表团用了十亿美元以上的军事物资，改编和扩充蒋介石的残兵败将。美军司令部毫不掩饰他们要利用蒋介石军队作为侵略中华人民共和国的工具。美国侵略者一再指使蒋匪向我国沿海进行武装骚扰，从台湾派遣和指挥特务分子潜入我国大陆从事破坏活动，教唆蒋匪在公海上进行海盗式的劫掠行为，拦劫各国商船，粗暴地破坏世界各国与远东之间的航运和贸易。美国统治集团的这一切胡作非为的目的，都是为了想来摇撼已经磐石一般地屹立在世界上的中华人民共和国。任何费尽心机的借口也不能掩饰，美国所以死硬地反对它和它的盟国改善与中华人民共和国之间的关系，正是因为它不肯放弃这个自讨苦吃的敌视中国人民的政策。
    美国对中国的侵略和挑衅的政策，彻底违反了国际法规和道义的最起码的准则，暴露了美国统治集团是一个无法无天的侵略者和殖民主义者，它妄图扭转历史的进程，建立它在亚洲和全世界的殖民统治。这个反动政策，不仅是中国人民所不能容许的，而且也是和亚洲与世界各国的利益相冲突的，同时对美国自己也是不利的。因此，这个反动政策不能不一再碰壁。
    只要不是瞎子都能看见，中华人民共和国的国际地位和声望日益提高。它已经与苏联和各人民民主国家建立了牢不可破的兄弟般的关系。以苏联为首的和平民主阵营已强大到这样的地步，谁敢对它发动战争，谁就是自寻死路；新的世界大战只是意味着整个资本主义制度的灭亡。因此，资本主义各国越来越多的政治家，已不愿追随美国的这个政策，而要采取独立自主的政策。现在，拥有人口十亿以上的二十五个国家已经或正在和中华人民共和国建立外交关系。更多的国家正在恢复和扩大与中华人民共和国的贸易和文化交流。各国的政府和议会人士、工会、文化界、工商界和其他各界的代表，越来越多地来到中华人民共和国访问。中国人民和世界各国人民之间的关系更加密切了。
    目前这个形势又有了新的发展。日内瓦会议的召开的重大意义，是在于中华人民共和国以大国之一的地位参加解决亚洲问题，宣告了亚洲人民不能过问亚洲自己的问题的时代一去不复返了。中华人民共和国代表团对和平解决朝鲜问题和恢复印度支那和平问题所采取的立场和主张，是符合亚洲和世界各国的和平利益的。
    最近中印、中缅会谈所产生的重大的积极影响，是有目共睹的。中、印、缅三国总理一致表示要促进日内瓦会议关于恢复印度支那和平的成功，并宣告了发展相互关系和适用于一般国际关系的五项原则，并得到了世界其他国家的广泛的支持。英国首相邱吉尔和外交大臣艾登最近谈到英国对东南亚问题的政策时，表示同意和平共处的原则。这就清清楚楚地说明，美国拼凑东南亚军事集团或“东北亚联盟”、扩大印度支那战争、制造亚洲紧张局势的阴谋活动，是不得人心的。所谓“东南亚”侵略集团，竟得不到一个东南亚的主要国家的支持，其实际价值如何，已经可想而知了。
    这些天来美国鼓吹敌视中华人民共和国的一群议员们这样动肝火，甚至美国总统和国务卿都有必要出来声明他们将“战至最后一分钟”反对中华人民共和国取得在联合国的合法地位，就完全不是偶然的。从亚洲到西欧、北欧，一直到美洲，到处响起的一片要求和平、要求承认中国的国际地位和合法权利、要求缓和国际紧张局势的呼声，把美国统治集团逼到墙角落里去了。
    因此，很显然，美国统治集团如果不愿收起已经证明行不通的敌视中华人民共和国的政策，将会有什么结果，那将是再清楚不过的事了。
