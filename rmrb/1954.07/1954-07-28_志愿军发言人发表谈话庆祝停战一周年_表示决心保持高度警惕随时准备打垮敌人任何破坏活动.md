(Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 26) The spokesman of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army issued a statement to our agency reporter on the eve of the first anniversary of the Korean Armistice. The full text is as follows:

　　The Korean armistice has been in effect for one year. The Korean people, who won the armistice victory with their heroic battles, have achieved significant results in restoring and rebuilding their motherland after the armistice. In the past year, thanks to the concerted efforts of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, the international peace movement has been further developed. The easing of international tensions began with the Korean armistice. The recent restoration of peace in Indochina as a result of the Geneva Conference further vividly proves this point.

　　The lofty purpose of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's resist-America, aid-Korea movement is to stop aggression, defend the construction of the motherland, assist the just struggle of the Korean people, and safeguard peace in Asia and the world. Therefore, after the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement, all commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, who love peace and labor, while strictly guarding their positions, used their hands that defend peace to carry out labor to help the Korean people heal the wounds of war and restore peaceful life on the land where they had shed blood. From the Yalu River to north of the Demilitarized Zone, from the east coast to the west coast, from the heroic city of Pyongyang to the vast countryside, there are moving scenes of the Volunteer Army and the Korean people working side by side. They are building office buildings, schools, dormitories, filling bomb craters, planting crops, planting trees, repairing canals, reservoirs, and dikes... According to incomplete statistics, from August 1953 to the end of June this year, the various units of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army have helped the Korean people build a total of 187 public places, 142 schools and 357 rooms, build 188,497 houses and 661 buildings, reclaim 8,908,480 "ping" of wasteland for cultivation, plant 8,536,561 trees, and repair 826 canals and dikes.

　　In these works, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army displayed a high degree of internationalism. In almost all construction sites, Volunteer Army commanders and fighters put forward the slogan "We must help the Korean people build like we build our motherland." The volunteer engineer unit participating in the construction of Pyongyang composed a song, they sang: "We go to the battlefield side by side in combat, we sweat together in construction... We build heroic Pyongyang, just like building Beijing..."

　　The Korean people gave great encouragement to the Volunteer Army in the construction work aided by the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. Many monuments built next to buildings and "Volunteer Army Bridge," "Volunteer Army Kiln," "Korea-China Friendship Reservoir," and "Friendship Dormitory," will forever symbolize the unbreakable combat friendship between the Chinese and Korean people.

　　Over the past year, all commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, together with the Korean People's Army, have resolutely implemented all the provisions of the Armistice Agreement, strictly observed and fulfilled by Marshal Kim Il-sung and Commander Peng Dehuai. The Czech and Polish members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission also pointed out the fact that the Korean and Chinese sides have consistently abided by the provisions of the Armistice Agreement in the "Report on Military Reinforcements Brought into Korea by the United Nations Command in Violation of the Armistice Agreement from July 27, 1953 to April 15, 1954."

　　In sharp contrast to the fact that the Korean and Chinese People's forces have consistently strictly abided by the Armistice Agreement, is the fact that the American aggressors and the Syngman Rhee bandit gang have continuously violated the agreement. As everyone knows, before the Armistice Agreement was signed, the United States condoned the Syngman Rhee group's sabotage of the part of the Armistice Agreement regarding the repatriation of prisoners of war. On the twelfth day after the signing – August 8, 1953, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles signed a "Mutual Defense Treaty" with Syngman Rhee, stipulating that the United States has the right to station troops in South Korea indefinitely. On August 7 of the same year, the United States also coerced fifteen other countries to issue a "Sixteen-Nation Declaration," issuing a presumptuous clamor to resume the Korean War and make it not limited to the Korean territory, attempting to threaten the Chinese and Korean people and the people of the world. In just seventeen days from July 27 to August 12, 1953, the U.S. side violated the Armistice Agreement 35 times. On January 20 and 21, 1954, the American aggressors illegally robbed more than 21,900 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war. Before this, they had robbed more than 27,000 of our prisoners of war from June 18 to 22, 1953. According to incomplete statistics from July 27, 1953 to July 15 this year, American planes violated the Armistice Agreement by intruding into our area and the airspace above our coastal waters in 332 batches, totaling 750 sorties. Personnel crossed the border 12 times, totaling 75 people, and 6 cars. Enemy troops dispatched special agents and armed attackers, and in the three and a half months from April to mid-July this year alone, there were as many as 19 incidents that have been protested by our side and made public. Some of the figures listed above have been formally protested by our side to the U.S. side. Although most of them have been denied by the consistently cunning and deceitful enemy, in the face of conclusive evidence, the U.S. side had to bow its head and admit its guilt in some of them.

　　Since the Geneva Conference opened on April 26, the Chinese and Korean people and the people of the world have hoped that it will achieve complete victory. Now the Geneva Conference has achieved a major achievement in restoring peace in Indochina, which is another major victory of peace over war following the Korean armistice. However, due to the sabotage of the United States, the Geneva Conference, which lasted 51 days and held 15 plenary meetings, ended without reaching any agreement on the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue. After this, under the instigation of American warmongers, the Syngman Rhee bandit gang stepped up preparations to launch new provocations to undermine the implementation of the Armistice Agreement and threaten the stability of the Korean armistice. Recently, the American war peddler Van Fleet has run to Taiwan three times, attempting to conclude a so-called "bilateral treaty on common security" between the U.S. and Chiang Kai-shek bandits. Obviously, the American aggressors want to consolidate their aggressive act of occupying our territory Taiwan through treaty form, so as to turn Taiwan into a base for U.S. imperialism to further invade our mainland. When Van Fleet went to Taiwan, there was news that the United States even wanted to openly expand the scope of the U.S. Seventh Fleet's aggressive activities to the islands along our coast. The American aggressors are also stepping up the organization of military blocs in Northeast Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East, attempting to form a "crescent-shaped chain" to surround our great motherland.

　　All commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army express great indignation at the American aggressors' behavior of making enemies of the Chinese and Korean people, the Asian people, and the people of the world. While celebrating the first anniversary of the victory of the Korean armistice, we are determined to maintain the highest degree of vigilance, strictly guard our positions, continuously improve our military and political level, and, together with the Korean People's Army, be ready at any time to smash any enemy invasion and sabotage activities, in order to defend the socialist construction of the motherland and defend peace in the Far East and the world.

    志愿军发言人发表谈话庆祝停战一周年
    表示决心保持高度警惕随时准备打垮敌人任何破坏活动
   【新华社平壤二十六日电】中国人民志愿军发言人在朝鲜停战一周年前夕向本社记者发表谈话，全文如下：
    朝鲜停战一周年了。以自己的英雄战斗赢得了停战胜利的朝鲜人民，在停战后又取得了恢复和重建自己祖国的重大成就。一年来，由于以苏联为首的和平民主阵营的一致努力，国际和平运动得到了进一步的发展。以朝鲜停战为起点，国际紧张局势开始有了一些缓和。最近日内瓦会议导致的印度支那和平的恢复，就更生动地证明了这一点。
    中国人民志愿军抗美援朝运动的崇高目的，就是为了制止侵略，保卫祖国建设，援助朝鲜人民的正义斗争，保卫亚洲与世界和平。所以当朝鲜停战协定签字以后，热爱和平、热爱劳动的中国人民志愿军的全体指挥员、战斗员，在严守阵地的同时，就以保卫和平的双手在自己曾经流过血的土地上展开了帮助朝鲜人民医治战争创伤、恢复和平生活的劳动。从鸭绿江到非军事区北缘线以北，从东海岸到西海岸，从英雄城平壤市到广大乡村，都有志愿军和朝鲜人民并肩劳动的动人场面。他们一起盖办公大楼、学校、宿舍、填弹坑、种庄稼、植树、修水渠、水库、堤坝……。据不完全的统计，自一九五三年八月到今年六月底，中国人民志愿军各部队共帮助朝鲜人民修建公共场所一百八十七所，学校一百四十二所又三百五十七间，修盖房子十八万八千四百九十七间又六百六十一座，开荒耕地八百九十万八千四百八十坪，植树八百五十三万六千五百六十一棵，修水渠、堤坝八百二十六条。
    在这些工作中，中国人民志愿军发挥了高度的国际主义精神。几乎在所有的工地上，志愿军指挥员、战斗员们都提出“要像建设祖国一样地来帮助朝鲜人民建设”的口号。参加建设平壤市的志愿军工兵部队编了一首歌，他们唱着：“战斗中我们并肩上战场，建设里我们汗水一块淌……我们建设英雄的平壤，就像建设北京……”
    朝鲜人民在中国人民志愿军帮助修建的工作中，给予志愿军很大的鼓舞。许多建筑在建筑物旁的纪念碑和“志愿军桥”“志愿军窑”“朝中团结贮水池”“友谊宿舍”一样，将永远象征着中朝人民牢不可破的战斗友谊。
      一年来，中国人民志愿军全体指挥员、战斗员和朝鲜人民军一道，坚决地执行了金日成元帅和彭德怀司令员严格遵守并履行停战协定的一切规定。中立国监察委员会波捷委员在“关于联合国军方面在一九五三年七月二十七日至一九五四年四月十五日期间违反停战协定以军事增援运入朝鲜的报告”中，也指出朝中方面一贯遵守停战协定的规定的事实。
    与朝中人民部队一贯严格遵守停战协定的事实成鲜明对比的，却是美国侵略者和李承晚匪帮不断违反协议的事实。大家知道，在停战协定未签订之前，美国就纵容李承晚集团破坏了停战协定中关于
  战俘遣返的协议部分。在签字后的第十二天——一
  九五三年八月八日，美国国务卿杜勒斯就和李承晚签订了“共同防御条约”，规定美国有权无限期驻留军队在南朝鲜。同年八月七日美国并压迫其他十
  五国发表了“十六国宣言”，发出以重新恢复朝鲜
  战争并使之不限于朝鲜境内的狂妄叫嚣，企图威胁
  中朝人民和世界人民。仅在一九五三年七月二十七
  日到同年八月十二日短短十七天中，美方违反停战
  协定的事件就有三十五次。在一九五四年一月二十
  日和二十一日，美国侵略者更非法劫夺二万一千九百多名朝中被俘人员，在这之前还于一九五三年六月十八日至二十二日劫走了我方被俘人员二万七千多名。根据一九五三年七月二十七日到今年七月十五日的不完全统计，美国飞机违反停战协定侵入我方地区及沿海上空的就有三百三十二批、七百五十架次。人员越界有十二次、七十五人、汽车六辆。敌军派遣特务和武装袭击者，仅今年四月到七月中旬的三个半月中，经我方抗议和已经公布的就达十九次之多。上面列举的数字，其中一部分经过我方正式向美方提出抗议，虽大部分被一贯狡猾抵赖的敌人所否认，但在证据确凿的事实面前，美方不得不对其中一部分罪恶低头认错。
    日内瓦会议在四月二十六日开会以来，中朝人民和全世界人民都希望它获得完满的胜利。现在日内瓦会议获得了恢复印度支那和平的重大成就，这是继朝鲜停战以后和平战胜战争的又一次重大胜利。但是由于美国的破坏，历时五十一天、经过十五次全体会议的日内瓦会议关于和平解决朝鲜问题的讨论，竟没有达成任何协议就告结束。在这以后，李承晚匪帮又在美国好战分子的策动之下，加紧准备发动新的挑衅，来破坏停战协定的实施和威胁朝鲜停战的稳定。最近美国战争贩子范佛里特又三次跑到台湾，企图在美蒋匪帮之间订立所谓“共同安全双边条约”。显然，美国侵略者是想把它强占我国领土台湾的侵略行为通过条约形式固定下来，从而使台湾变为美帝国主义进一步侵略我国大陆的基地。在范佛里特到台湾的时候，有消息说美国竟想公然把美国第七舰队的侵略活动的范围扩大到我国沿海的岛屿。美国侵略者还加紧组织东北亚、东南亚和中近东军事集团，企图构成“半月形锁链”把我们伟大祖国包围起来。
    中国人民志愿军全体指挥员、战斗员对美国侵略者这种与中朝人民、亚洲人民和世界人民为敌的行为，表示极大的愤慨。在我们庆祝朝鲜停战一周年胜利的同时，决心保持最高度的警惕，严守阵地，不断提高自己的军事、政治水平，和朝鲜人民军一道随时准备打垮敌人任何侵袭和破坏活动，以保卫祖国的社会主义建设，保卫远东和世界和平。
