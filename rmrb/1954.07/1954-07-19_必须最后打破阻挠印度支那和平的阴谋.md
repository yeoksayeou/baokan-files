Title: The Conspiracy to Obstruct Peace in Indochina Must Be Finally Broken

The question of restoring peace in Indochina is said to be decided in the next few days, but it should also be said that the conspirators who obstruct peace in Indochina and put together the Pacific aggressive alliance are doing everything they can to show their tricks in these few days.

Originally, from the time the foreign ministers of the Soviet Union, China, France, and Britain returned to Geneva to the period of the Western Three Foreign Ministers' Paris Conference, most of the Western newspapers were optimistic. The delegations of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the People's Republic of China, and the Soviet Union, with their consistent sincerity in reaching agreements quickly and rationally, did everything they could to seek compromises on the issue of troop assembly zones, or the issues of Laos and Cambodia, as well as political issues and universal suffrage. Many insightful Western politicians also looked forward to peaceful coexistence in Southeast Asia from the impending peace in Indochina, which is certainly welcome.

However, after U.S. Secretary of State Dulles flew to Paris to convene a meeting of the British and French foreign ministers, some American newspapers suddenly came up with the ghost story of "the Communists' tough attitude" to spread pessimistic air. The Associated Press reported on the Geneva Conference on the 17th, saying that "there is no progress on any dispute" and "a gloomy atmosphere enveloped the conference," and even individual French bourgeois newspapers that had always been optimistic suddenly became less optimistic. At the same time, as the Paris newspaper "Liberation" said on July 17, after the Western Three Foreign Ministers' Paris Conference, some French newspapers subsidized by the United States reversed their past criticism of the new French cabinet and became "supporters," even the People's Republican Party's "Parisian Liberated," which is close to Bidault, also joined in, calling the French representatives currently in Geneva "unyielding and unshakable diplomats" that "communist diplomats should carefully evaluate."

How to explain this phenomenon?

It is still necessary to find the reason from the U.S. Secretary of State's visit to Paris. Regarding Dulles's visit to Paris, the French newspaper "Lyon Progress" said: "The truth is that the U.S. Secretary of State is uneasy seeing the opportunity for 'negotiated peace' becoming clear." Just like when he came to Paris three months ago, he was still talking about his Southeast Asia aggressive group plan as soon as he got off the plane; when he returned to Washington, he reiterated that the United States would never abandon the "principles" it followed. The most popular saying in the various rumors in Geneva is: the United States decided in the Paris talks to participate in the Geneva Conference again with ministerial-level representatives in order to strengthen the intimidation and pressure on the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and China and the Soviet Union, and to force the people of Indochina to accept a humiliating ceasefire. According to Western newspapers, the conspiracy plan designed by Washington is:

(1) Create an atmosphere of "sudden toughness by the Communists in the negotiations" to cover up the fact that the representatives of Western countries insist on not making any compromises in the negotiations and only ask the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to make concessions again and again.

(2) If there is any ceasefire agreement, it must be approved by the United States, that is, to minimize the democratic forces of the people of the three Indochinese countries, and to delay the democratic unification required by the people as much as possible so that it cannot be realized at all.

(3) Turn the areas outside the Democratic Republic of Vietnam into a second South Korea, and then incorporate it with Laos and Cambodia into the U.S. Pacific aggressive alliance as a basis for expanding the war in the future.

This popular saying in Geneva can also be proved by some French newspapers. For example, the Paris newspaper "Le Figaro," which is often referred to as reflecting American opinions, reported on July 16 that before July 20, if the foreign ministers solved the problem of the division of military assembly zones, there would be a "political war" to be fought, that is, the struggle for universal suffrage in the Indochinese countries after the ceasefire in order to achieve the democratic unification required by the people. The newspaper said this when opposing setting a date for the earliest possible national election: "If that is done, Western countries will see the possibility that the demarcation line will be immediately threatened, and they must obviously plan to consolidate this line, and the Communists will quickly see the establishment of a defense organization in Southeast Asia." The newspaper does not conceal that "the Southeast Asia defense organization will allow the United States to permanently establish itself in Asia."

Isn't this obvious? Taking Dulles's visit to Paris as an opportunity, a conspiracy that violates the will of the people of Indochina, the will of the French people, and the will of peace-loving people all over the world is being carried out at this final decisive moment of the Geneva Conference.

People have seen that although the foreign ministers in Geneva have been in very frequent contact outside the meetings in the past few days, the distance of the points of divergence has not been shortened. The key to the problem is that the actual actions of the representatives of Western countries do not conform to their verbal desire to reach an agreement quickly, and the destructive influence of the United States is hindering the road to reaching an agreement. The representatives of Western countries have not expressed the sincerity necessary to reach an agreement. They only unilaterally demand concessions from the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, but they themselves stand still. Western officials do not hide their waiting for the last five minutes of July 20. They use this date as a threat to demand as many concessions as possible from the other party. They call this action that violates the spirit of consultation and mutual concession a "diplomatic practice," while the United States uses this situation to obstruct the reaching of any agreement. The American propaganda machine has undisguisedly revealed Washington's schadenfreude.

Such practices by Western countries are obviously contrary to the urgent desire of people all over the world to quickly end the Indochina War, and also contrary to the interests of the French people.

The French people, fearing that this "dirty war" cannot be ended quickly, so that the hope of peace is in serious danger of being finally shattered, have taken active actions, and hundreds of thousands of people's delegations are again flooding into Geneva like a tide, demanding a ceasefire agreement as soon as possible.

Can the people of Indochina, who have been fighting for the just cause of their national independence and freedom rights for eight years with bloodshed and sacrifice, allow their motherland to be divided and the land of their motherland to be reduced to a base for American imperialism to prepare for new large-scale aggression? Obviously not!

The delegations of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the People's Republic of China, and the Soviet Union have always held sincere wishes and have been working hard to find ways to quickly realize peace in Indochina on the basis of respecting the national rights of the local people. The three delegations continue to work hard to achieve a fair and reasonable ceasefire agreement as soon as possible that is glorious for both belligerent parties.

There is no doubt that the hope for peace in Indochina still exists. To finally realize it depends on whether the French delegation can firmly implement the will of the French people, get rid of the destructive influence of the United States, and adopt a sincere and realistic attitude of consultation. In particular, it depends on the peace forces making persistent efforts to finally defeat the conspiracy of the United States to undermine the Geneva Conference in the next few days.
Geneva, July 18

    必须最后打破阻挠印度支那和平的阴谋
    本报记者　杜波
    人们说恢复印度支那和平问题将决定于今后这几天了，但还应当说阻挠印度支那和平、纠集太平洋侵略同盟的阴谋家们正在这几天里竭尽一切地施展其伎俩。
    本来从苏中法英的外长们回到日内瓦的前后，到西方三外长巴黎会议这个期间，大多数的西方报纸都在保持着乐观，越南民主共和国、中华人民共和国和苏联的代表团本着迅速合理地达成协议的一贯诚意，不论在军队集结区问题上，或是老挝柬埔寨问题以及政治问题、普选问题上，莫不竭尽所能地寻求妥协。不少的西方有见识的政界人士还从印度支那可能即将实现的和平展望到东南亚的和平共处，这当然是值得欢迎的。
    但是，从美国国务卿杜勒斯飞到巴黎召集英法外长开会之后，一些美国的报刊忽然想出了“共产党态度强硬”的鬼话来散布悲观空气。美联社十七日报道日内瓦会议时就说“在任何一个争端上都毫无进展”、“阴暗的气氛笼罩了会议”，甚至个别一向保持乐观的法国资产阶级报纸也突然不抱乐观了。与此同时，正如七月十七日巴黎“解放”报所说的，从西方三外长巴黎会议之后，法国的一些受美国补贴的报纸一反过去对法国新内阁责难的态度而变为“捧场”了，甚至接近皮杜尔的人民共和党的
  “解放了的巴黎人”报也参加进来，把目前在日内瓦的法国代表们称作“共产党外交家们应该好好估量的”、“不屈不挠的不可动摇的外交家”了。
    怎样解释这种现象呢？
    还是应当从美国国务卿的这次来巴黎寻找原因。对于杜勒斯的来巴黎，法国“里昂进步”报说：“事实的真相乃是美国国务卿看到‘谈判的和平’的机会明确起来而感到不安。”正如三个月前他来到巴黎一样，他这次下机伊始，仍然谈着他的东南亚侵略集团计划；当他回到华盛顿之后，他又重复说明美国决不放弃它所遵循的“原则”。在日内瓦的纷纭的传说中最流行的说法是：美国在巴黎会谈中决定再度以部长级的代表参加日内瓦会议，以便加强对越南民主共和国和中苏两国的威吓和压力，使印度支那人民接受一个屈辱的停战。据西方报刊透露，由华盛顿设计的阴谋计划是：
    （一）制造“共产党在谈判中突然强硬”的空气，以掩盖西方国家代表在谈判中坚持不作任何妥协而一味要求越南民主共和国一让再让。
      （二）如果有任何停战协议的话，那必须是为美国所同意的，即将印度支那三国人民民主力量极力缩小，对于人民所要求的民主统一则尽量拖延以至使它根本不能实现。
    （三）将越南民主共和国以外的地区变为第二个南朝鲜，再把它和老挝柬埔寨一起并入美国的太平洋侵略同盟中去，作为来日扩大战争的依据。
    这种在日内瓦流行的说法还可以从法国的一些报纸上找到证明。例如常被人们指为反映美国意见的巴黎“费加罗”报七月十六日报道说，在七月二十日以前，如果外长们解决了军事集结区的划分问题，还有一场“政治战”要进行，这就是关于停战后在印度支那各国进行普选，以便达到人民所要求的民主统一的斗争。该报在反对订出一个尽早实行全国选举的日期时这样说：“如果那样作，西方国家将看到分治线有立即受到威胁的可能，它们显然必须预谋方策来巩固这条线，而共产党人将迅速看到东南亚的防御组织的成立。”该报并不掩饰“东南亚防御组织将使美国永久立足亚洲”。
    这还不明显吗？以杜勒斯的来到巴黎为契机，一种违反印度支那人民意志、违反法国人民意志和违反全世界爱好和平人民意志的阴谋，正在日内瓦会议的这个最后决定性的关头施展着。
    人们已经看到，在日内瓦的外长们这几天来虽然十分频繁地在会外接触，但分歧点的距离仍然没有缩短。问题的关键是西方国家的代表们的实际行动并不符合他们在口头上所表示的要迅速达成协议的愿望，美国破坏性的影响正阻碍着通向达成协议的道路。西方国家的代表们并没有表示为达成协议所必须的诚意，他们只是单方面要求越南民主共和国让步，而自己却踏步不前。西方国家的官员们毫不掩饰他们等待七月二十日的最后五分钟，他们把这个日期作为尽量要求对方让步的要挟。他们把这种违反协商和互让的精神的行动称之为“外交惯例”，而美国方面则利用这种情况来阻挠任何协议的达成。美国的宣传机器已毫不掩饰华盛顿方面的幸灾乐祸。
    西方国家这样的作法显然是违反全世界人民要求迅速停止印度支那战争的迫切愿望的，也是违反法国人民的利益的。
    法国人民因为担心这场“肮脏战争”不能迅速停止，以致和平的希望有被最后破灭的严重危险，已经积极行动起来了，成百成千的人民代表团又在像潮水一样涌到日内瓦来，要求迅速达成停战协议。
    八年来流血牺牲为求自己民族独立和自由权利的正义事业而奋斗的印度支那人民，难道可以容许自己的祖国被分裂，使祖国的土地沦为美帝国主义准备新的大规模侵略的基地吗？显然不能！
    越南民主共和国、中华人民共和国和苏联的代表团始终抱着真诚的愿望，一直努力寻求方法，使印度支那和平在尊重当地人民的民族权利的基础上迅速实现。三国代表团仍然继续努力争取早日达成对交战双方都是光荣的公平合理的停战协议。
    没有疑问，印度支那和平的希望还依然存在着。要最后实现它，决定于法国代表团是否能坚决执行法国人民的意志，摆脱美国的破坏性的影响，采取真诚的现实的协商态度，特别决定于今后数日内和平力量再接再厉地最后战胜美国破坏日内瓦会议的阴谋。
                      七月十八日于日内瓦
