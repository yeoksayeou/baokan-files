Xinhua News Agency, July 9th: Units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army are conducting in-depth propaganda and discussion of the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China.

    In late June or early July, PLA units stationed in Beijing held report meetings on the Draft Constitution, and systematically launched propaganda and discussion of the Draft Constitution. Cadres and soldiers of the air defense forces stationed in Beijing, in connection with their personal experiences and the tasks of the army, carefully discussed the various contents of the Draft Constitution, and expressed their determination to support the Draft Constitution with practical actions. Sergeant Xie Zhongyun of a certain anti-aircraft artillery regiment said: "For five generations, no one in my family has been literate. I only became literate after joining the revolutionary army. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, my wish has been fulfilled. My son has entered middle school, and my wife has become a village cadre. Now the Draft Constitution clearly stipulates the right of citizens to receive education." Yin Ziyi, deputy company commander of a certain regiment, said: "Serving in the military is the glorious duty of every citizen, and it is very glorious to be a revolutionary soldier defending the motherland. I will definitely lead all the soldiers in the company to master military skills more proficiently and strive to fulfill my glorious responsibilities." After participating in the discussion of the Draft Constitution, Cao Xingfu, a squad leader of a certain company, immediately wrote a letter to his younger brother who was waiting for admission to school at home, explaining that even if he did not enter middle school, participating in labor was also a glorious thing. In military training, many soldiers used supporting the Draft Constitution and fulfilling the responsibilities stipulated in the Draft Constitution as slogans, and worked harder in military studies. Cadres and soldiers of the engineering troops stationed in Beijing are discussing the first chapter of the Draft Constitution. Cadres and soldiers expressed many thoughts on the beautiful prospects of the motherland and the glorious tasks of the people's army. A certain unit of the artillery troops stationed in Beijing held a report meeting on the Draft Constitution in late June, and then enthusiastically launched propaganda and discussion. In addition to adopting small group discussions, they also organized large group discussion meetings and invited responsible leaders to participate and guide.

    Units under the North China Military Region entered comprehensive propaganda and discussion from June 20th. Wired broadcasting stations and blackboards in various units also carried out propaganda centered on the Draft Constitution. The clubs in the troops organized outlets for the sale of the single-volume edition of the Draft Constitution to meet the needs of cadres and soldiers. The 560 copies of the single-volume edition of the Draft Constitution that arrived at a certain unit were sold out in two hours. Cadres and soldiers also purchased many books and newspapers related to the Draft Constitution, and many people sent the single-volume edition of the Draft Constitution to their families. Duty personnel also automatically organized collective reading and discussion after leaving their posts or finishing their work. After discussing the provisions on cherishing and protecting public property, cadres and soldiers further strengthened the concept of cherishing state property and practicing economy. After detailed research, warehouse managers of a certain unit improved the methods of transporting and loading and unloading materials, and did the loading and unloading themselves, saving the state loading and unloading fees.

    The leading organs of the East China Military Region held a report meeting on the Draft Constitution on June 28, and then entered widespread propaganda and discussion. Cadres and soldiers stationed at the Xiamen coastal defense outpost read and discussed newspapers carrying the Draft Constitution whenever they had time, whether on the front line, in the office, in the kitchen, or on the playground. Cai E, a combat hero of a certain unit, said: When I picked up the Draft Constitution and read it word by word, I thought that the Draft Constitution stipulated the interests of the working people so specifically and thoughtfully, even stipulating the right to rest. This is truly a people's Draft Constitution.

    Soldiers of a certain unit of the Northeast Military Region who were participating in voluntary labor on both sides of the Nanhu Canal in Shenyang were even more enthusiastic about labor after reading the Draft Constitution. They proposed to complete the task ahead of schedule and ensure the good quality of the project as a gift to the Draft Constitution.

    In order to draw on experience and make the discussion of the Draft Constitution better, a certain artillery unit of the Southwest Military Region sent cadres to participate in the discussion of cadres of local government agencies. Leaders of the Sichuan Military Region and leading cadres of various units personally led the troops to conduct discussions. In many units, 80% of the people bought newspapers or single-volume editions carrying the Draft Constitution. In the troops in the Daliangshan area, propaganda and discussion of the Draft Constitution were also launched in camps, in deep mountains and dense forests, or on road construction sites. A certain unit also held a forum for meritorious personnel and models. Combat hero Liu Hongwa said: After discussing the Draft Constitution, I feel that the task is clearer and the enthusiasm is greater!

    Units of the Xinjiang Military Region are vigorously promoting and discussing the Draft Constitution. All units have successively held general meetings of all soldiers, and leading cadres have made reports on the Draft Constitution. All units have also sent propaganda teams and propaganda floats to publicize the Draft Constitution to people of all ethnic groups. The discussion of the Draft Constitution in the troops is very lively. Ai De Ni Ha Zi, a combat hero and labor model of a certain regiment, said in the discussion: We must work hard to learn military skills, defend the motherland, and support the Draft Constitution.
