    Active Petroleum Geological Teams in the Northwest Region
    The geological teams dispatched to the Northwest by the Geological Bureau of the Petroleum Administration Bureau of the Central Fuel Industry Ministry have successively begun their work. The geological team that started from Dunhuang in mid-May and advanced towards the Qaidam Basin safely reached the basin after traversing more than 500 kilometers of waterless and uninhabited areas. Now, they have comprehensively launched prospecting work. They encountered many difficulties in the preliminary survey, but they have discovered a large number of oil seepages and some complete oil-bearing structures, which may contain abundant petroleum. Preliminary confirmation indicates that the Qaidam Basin is a very promising oilfield.
    In the Turpan Basin of Xinjiang, a geological team has also comprehensively launched work. They arrived in Shanshan on May 3rd, and after a preliminary survey, they formally began work in different zones. During the preliminary survey, they discovered oil seepages in a certain location, and the oil layer was quite thick. Local residents had used indigenous methods to dig wells and extract oil, and they could extract dozens of kilograms per day. In addition, they also discovered some oil-bearing structures.
    Team 101 of the Chaoshui Petroleum Geological Team, which crossed the Badain Jaran Desert in Ningxia, arrived at the seat of the Ejin Banner Autonomous Region People's Government. They traversed the boundless Gobi grasslands and climbed over the great sand dunes. During the most difficult times, they had to walk more than 100 li (Chinese miles) on the desert ground for more than a dozen hours a day; the sun was like a raging fire, and each person could only drink a small pot of water each day; at night, they bivouacked on the beach, suffering from wind and sandstorms. They fought the wind and sand for six days and six nights, successfully completing the first phase of their work.

    活跃在西北地区的石油地质队
    中央燃料工业部石油管理总局地质局，派赴西北的地质大队已陆续展开工作。五月中旬从敦煌开始向柴达木盆地前进的地质大队，经过五百多公里无水无人的地区，平安地到达了盆地里。现在，他们已全面地展开了普查工作。在粗查工作中，他们碰到了很多困难，但已经发现了大量的油苗露头，还有一些完整的储油构造，这些构造里都可能储藏着丰富的石油。初步证实，柴达木盆地是很有希望的油田。
    在新疆吐鲁番盆地里，有一个地质大队也已全面展开工作。他们在五月三日到达鄯善，粗查之后即分区正式展开工作。粗查中，他们在某处发现了油苗，油层相当厚，当地居民曾用土法挖井采油，每天可挖数十公斤。此外，他们还发现了一些储油构造。
    穿过宁夏巴丹吉林大沙漠的潮水石油地质大队一零一队，到达了额济纳旗自治区人民政府所在地。他们走过了一望无际的戈壁草滩，翻越了大沙山。在最艰苦的时候，他们一天要在沙漠地上走一百多华里，工作十几个小时；太阳像烈火，每人每天只能喝一小壶水；晚上露宿在沙滩上，受着风沙的袭击。他们和风沙斗争了六天六夜，胜利完成了第一阶段的工作。
