    Autumn and winter fabrics have begun to appear in store windows in the capital, even while people are still wearing summer clothes. So far, more than 25,000 bolts of printed fabrics, including printed serge, floral twill, and printed gabardine, have been shipped from Shanghai and Tianjin. Nearly 100 new varieties have been transported here. Currently, workers in textile printing and dyeing factories in Shanghai and Tianjin are still processing large quantities of floral fabrics needed by the people of the capital for the winter, and more novel floral fabrics will be shipped to Beijing one after another.
    Improving the variety of printed fabric products has become a daily focus for textile departments and relevant business departments. After the Ministry of Textile Industry, the China National Cotton Yarn and Fabric Company, the All-China Federation of Cooperatives, and the China National Department Store and other units jointly convened a symposium on printed fabric pattern design in May of this year, they are now proceeding from strengthening the leadership of pattern design work, strengthening cooperation among relevant departments, improving pattern selection work, and improving the ideological and artistic level of designers. The autumn and winter fabrics supplied to the people of the capital this year will be more numerous and have more patterns than in the same period last year, and there will also be some improvements in styling and color.

    秋冬季花布开始上市
    当人们还穿着夏衣的时候，各种坚实、美观的秋冬季用的花布已经开始在首都市面上的橱窗里出现了。到现在为止，从上海、天津两地运来的印花哔叽、花斜纹和印花贡呢等印花布已有二万五千多匹，新出的品种已运来近一百种。目前，上海和天津两地的纺织印染工厂的职工们，还在为首都人民冬季需要的花布大量的加工，更多新颖的花布将陆续运来北京。
    改进印花布的产品品种，已成为纺织部门和有关业务部门日常注意的课题。今年五月间，中央纺织工业部、花纱布公司、中华全国合作社联合总社和中国百货公司等单位共同召开印花布花纹图案设计座谈会以后，现在正从加强花纹图案设计的领导工作，从加强有关部门间的协作、改进花纹评选工作，从提高设计人员的思想艺术水平等方面着手进行。今年供应给首都人民的秋冬季花布，无论在数量上，在花型上都将比去年同期多，在造型和色彩方面，也将有若干改进。
