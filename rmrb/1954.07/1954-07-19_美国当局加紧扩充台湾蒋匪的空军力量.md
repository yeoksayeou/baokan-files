Xinhua News Agency, July 17th: To strengthen the use of Taiwan, our territory, as a military base for aggression against our country, the US authorities are intensifying the expansion of the air force of the Chiang Kai-shek remnants in Taiwan in order to expand war activities against the Chinese mainland.

According to a United Press International report from Washington on the 14th, the US government will soon hand over the first batch of F-86 Sabre jet fighters to the Chiang Kai-shek remnants. The report said: "The threat of Chiang Kai-shek remnants using US aircraft to conduct large-scale attacks against the Chinese mainland will continue to exist."

At the same time, on the orders of the United States, the Chiang Kai-shek remnants sent an air force delegation composed of 25 air force officers to the headquarters of the US Fifth Air Force stationed in South Korea to learn the tactics of the US Air Force in the Korean War. After arriving in Osan, South Korea, on the 12th, they listened to detailed instructions from Lieutenant General LeMay, commander of the US Fifth Air Force, and his staff, and received short-term training.

As everyone knows, after the United States launched the war of aggression against Korea in June 1950 and occupied Taiwan, our territory, it actively strengthened military assistance to the Chiang Kai-shek remnants and instructed them to continuously harass our coastal islands and the mainland, including air force harassment. Later, with the failure of the US war of aggression against Korea, US President Eisenhower publicly announced in early February 1953 that the United States would not only continue to occupy Taiwan, our territory, but also openly instigate and cover up the Chiang Kai-shek remnants' acts of aggression against the Chinese mainland. Senator Wiley, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, publicly stated at the time that the purpose of Eisenhower's new policy "has special military significance," "that is, the Chinese Kuomintang can use US-supplied aircraft to destroy railways on the Chinese mainland."

After the Eisenhower administration came to power, it further intensified the arming of the Chiang Kai-shek remnants, including intensifying the expansion of the Chiang bandit's air force, transporting large quantities of aircraft to Taiwan, training large numbers of Chiang bandit air force personnel, and sending large numbers of US air force personnel to Taiwan to train, control, and command the Chiang bandit air force. According to reports: Between March and May 1953, the United States handed over more than 70 jet trainers to the Chiang bandits for extensive flight training. In 1953, the United States trained a total of 3,500 Chiang bandit air force personnel in Taiwan, Japan, Okinawa, and the United States, as well as more than 800 senior pilots. In addition to instructing the Chiang bandits to recruit large numbers of aviation students in Taiwan and overseas, the United States also registered former Kuomintang air force personnel and summoned them to Taiwan for service.

Chase, the head of the US military assistance advisory group stationed in Taiwan, testified before the Senate Appropriations Committee during the final review of the 1954 "Common Security Appropriation," requesting an expansion of military assistance to the Chiang bandits. He admitted: "There is a large-scale jet aircraft training program underway in Taiwan." He said that the US Air Force had sent a team of air force instructors to Taiwan to train Chiang bandit air force personnel to fly jet aircraft, and sent two large air force detachments to train flight and ground crew personnel. US Air Force personnel control all aircraft landing sites and exercise areas in Taiwan.

According to reports: In the second half of 1953, the United States had already handed over approximately 100 F-84 Thunderjet jet fighters to the Chiang bandits for use. To further expand the Chiang bandit air force, many of the US military leaders who visited Taiwan in the first half of this year were US Air Force leaders. For example, former US Far East Air Force Commander Weyland, US Assistant Secretary of the Air Force John Roger Lewis, and former US Fifth Air Force Commander Anderson all visited Taiwan, inspected Taiwan's air force bases, and held secret talks with Chiang Kai-shek and Chiang bandit air force commander Wang Shu-ming to plan the expansion of the Chiang bandit air force. Anderson said recklessly in Seoul on April 20: If the Chiang bandit army "wants to attack the Chinese mainland, they must have sufficient air force support."

It is very clear that the US warmongering clique, which insists on being hostile to the Chinese people, after suffering a shameful defeat in the war of aggression against Korea, and while its conspiracy to continue and expand the Indochina war is constantly suffering setbacks, has not only not abandoned its policy of creating tension in the Far East and expanding its war of aggression against China, but is intensifying the use of Taiwan, our territory which it illegally occupies, as a military base, and is driving the Chiang Kai-shek traitor to act as a tool for US aggression against China. The recent intensification of piracy activities by the US-Chiang bandit gang in the high seas near Taiwan, hijacking merchant ships of various countries, intensifying harassment of Chinese coastal islands and the mainland from the sea and air, and intensifying the expansion of Chiang Kai-shek's air force and naval forces are all practical steps taken by the US warmongering clique to accelerate the implementation of this criminal policy. The Chinese people will never tolerate the US's unscrupulous implementation of this criminal policy. The Chinese people will be a hundred times more vigilant, closely watching all the conspiracies of the US aggressors, and ready to crush any adventure of the US-Chiang bandit gang at any time.

### 美国当局加紧扩充台湾蒋匪的空军力量

    美国当局加紧扩充台湾蒋匪的空军力量
    【新华社十七日讯】美国当局为了加强利用我国领土台湾作为侵略我国的军事基地，正在加紧扩充台湾蒋介石残匪的空军力量，以便扩大对我国大陆的战争活动。
    据合众社华盛顿十四日消息：美国政府将在最近把第一批F——八十六型的佩刀式喷气飞机交给蒋介石残匪。消息说：蒋介石残匪利用美国飞机对中国大陆“进行较大规模攻击的威胁今后将一直存在”。
    与此同时，蒋介石残匪奉美国的命令，派遣了由二十五名空军军官组成的空军代表团到盘踞在南朝鲜的美国第五航空队总部去，学习侵朝美国空军的战术。他们在十二日到达南朝鲜乌山之后，曾听取了美国第五航空队司令莱迈中将和他的参谋人员的详尽指示，并接受短期训练。
    大家知道，美国在一九五○年六月发动侵朝战争时侵占了我国领土台湾之后，就积极加强对蒋介石残匪的军事援助，并且指使他们不断对我国沿海岛屿和大陆进行骚扰，其中包括空军的骚扰。后来，随着美国侵朝战争的失败，美国总统艾森豪威尔在一九五三年二月初又公开宣布：美国不仅要继续侵占我国领土台湾，而且要公开策动和掩护蒋介石残匪对中国大陆进行侵略活动。美国参议院外交委员会主席维利当时曾公开宣称，艾森豪威尔的新政策的目的，“有着特别的军事意义”，“那就是中国国民党可以利用美国供给的飞机破坏中国大陆的铁路线”。
    艾森豪威尔政府上台之后，就进一步加紧武装蒋介石残匪，其中包括加紧扩充蒋匪的空军，将大批飞机运到台湾、大批地训练蒋匪空军人员、派遣大批美国空军人员到台湾训练、控制和指挥蒋匪空军。据消息透露：在一九五三年三月至五月间，美国共将喷气式教练机七十多架交给蒋匪，进行广泛的驾驶训练。一九五三年，美国在台湾、日本、冲绳和美国国内各地共训练蒋匪空军人员三千五百人，另有高级飞行员八百多人。美国除了指令蒋匪在台湾和海外招考大批航空学生之外，并且登记国民党的前空军人员，将他们召到台湾服役。
    美国派驻台湾的军事援助顾问团团长蔡斯曾在美国参院拨款委员会最后审核一九五四年度“共同安全拨款”时出席作证，要求扩大对蒋匪的军事援助，他承认：“在台湾有一个大规模的喷气飞机的训练计划正在进行中”。他说，美国空军已经派了一队空军教官到台湾训练蒋匪空军人员驾驶喷气飞机，并派了两大队空军人员去训练空勤和地勤人员。台湾的一切飞机降落场所和演习区域，都有美国空军人员进行控制。
    据消息报道：在一九五三年下半年，美国已经将F—八十四雷电式喷气飞机约一百架交给蒋匪使用。为了进一步扩充蒋匪空军，在今年上半年到台湾活动的美国军事首脑中，有许多是美国空军首脑。如前美国远东空军司令威兰、美国空军助理部长约翰·罗杰·刘易斯、前美国第五航空队司令安德逊等人，都先后到台湾进行过活动，视察台湾的空军基地，并且和蒋介石及蒋匪空军司令王叔铭等进行秘密会谈，筹划扩充蒋匪空军。安德逊四月二十日在汉城曾肆无忌惮地说：蒋匪军“如果要进攻中国大陆，它们必须要有足够的空军支持。”
    人们可以看得很清楚，坚持与中国人民为敌的美国好战集团，在侵朝战争遭受了可耻的失败之后，在企图继续并扩大印度支那战争的阴谋不断遭受挫折之时，不但没有放弃它的制造远东紧张局势和扩大侵略中国的战争政策，而且正在加紧利用它非法侵占的我国领土台湾作为军事基地，并驱使蒋介石卖国贼充当美国侵略中国的工具。美蒋匪帮最近在台湾附近的公海上加紧进行劫夺各国商船的海盗活动、加紧从海上和空中进行对中国沿海岛屿和大陆的袭扰、以及加紧扩充蒋介石的空军和海军力量，都是美国好战集团加紧推行这一罪恶政策的实际步骤。全中国人民对于美国肆无忌惮地进行这种罪恶政策决不能容忍。中国人民将百倍警惕地严密注视着美国侵略者的一切阴谋活动，准备随时粉碎美蒋匪帮的任何冒险。
