The Central Sports Commission and the Broadcasting Bureau of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government, and other units, have compiled the second set of broadcast exercises based on the demands of the broad masses.

Since its introduction in December 1951, the first set of broadcast exercises has been welcomed by the broad masses and has aroused widespread interest among the broad masses to participate in other sports activities. As of the end of June this year, 65% of the employees in the national railway system were able to persist in doing the broadcast exercises; according to incomplete statistics from 803 grassroots factories and mines in the Northeast region, more than 317,000 people regularly participated in the exercises. The promotion among students is even more widespread, with 90% of the millions of students in secondary schools and above participating in the broadcast exercises; in government agencies, since the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government issued the "Notice on Carrying out Work-Break Exercises and Other Sports Activities in Government Agencies" in March of this year, broadcast exercises in government agencies have also become active. All localities generally reported that broadcast exercises are of great help in improving health and increasing production, work, and study efficiency, and are also of great value for the overall exercise of the body. The broad masses universally hope that the sports authorities can compile new broadcast exercises.

In response to this situation, in March of this year, the Central Sports Commission of the Central People's Government and the Broadcasting Bureau of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government invited the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Education, the General Political Department of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, The Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League, the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, the Chinese Musicians Association, and some sports workers, with the help of Soviet sports expert Kailoshev, jointly compiled the second set of broadcast exercises, and conducted experiments in several factories, government agencies, and schools, absorbing the opinions of the broad masses, and making multiple revisions, and now decided to publish and promote it.

The Central People's Broadcasting Station has decided to start teaching the second set of broadcast exercises on the radio in mid-August, and local people's broadcasting stations across the country will also start holding relevant programs one after another. The Chinese Musicians Association is currently compiling suites for the new broadcast exercises. The People's Sports Publishing House will also publish the wall chart of the second set of broadcast exercises soon.

    已编制出第二套广播体操
    中央人民政府体育运动委员会和中央人民政府政务院文化教育委员会广播事业局等单位，根据广大群众的要求已编制出第二套广播体操。
    第一套广播体操自一九五一年十二月推行以来，已经受到了广大群众的欢迎。并且引起了广大群众参加其他体育活动的广泛兴趣。截至今年六月底止，全国铁路系统职工中，能坚持广播体操的已达全国铁路系统职工总人数的百分之六十五；据东北地区八百零三个基层厂矿的不完全统计，就有三十一万七千多人经常参加作操。在学生中推行更为广泛，全国中等以上学校中的几百万学生中百分之九十都参加了广播体操；在机关中，自今年三月中央人民政府政务院发布了“关于在政府机关中开展工间操和其他体育运动的通知”以后，机关的广播体操也活跃起来了。各地普遍反映：广播体操对于增进健康，提高生产、工作和学习效率有很大帮助，对于身体的全面锻炼也有很大价值。广大群众普遍希望体育主管部门能编制新的广播体操。
    根据这个情况，今年三月，中央人民政府体育运动委员会和政务院文化教育委员会广播事业局约请了卫生部、教育部、人民革命军事委员会总政治部、中华全国总工会、中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会、中华全国民主妇女联合会、中国音乐家协会和一部分体育工作者，在苏联体育专家凯洛舍夫的帮助下，共同编制了第二套广播体操，并且在若干工厂、机关和学校中进行了试验，吸收了广大群众的意见，多次进行修改，现决定公布推行。
    中央人民广播电台决定在八月中旬开始在广播中教授第二套广播体操，全国各地人民广播电台也将陆续开始举办有关的节目。中国音乐家协会现正在为新的广播体操编制组曲。人民体育出版社也将在最近出版第二套广播体操的挂图。
