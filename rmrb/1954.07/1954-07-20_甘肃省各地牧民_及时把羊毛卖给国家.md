Herdsmen in Various Parts of Gansu Province Promptly Sell Wool to the State
    Herdsmen in various parts of Gansu Province promptly sell wool to the state. By the end of June, the wool sold by herdsmen in various regions had exceeded 2,750,000 jin. Among these, farmers and herdsmen in the Xihai Gu Hui Autonomous Region sold over 500,000 jin of fine wool. In the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Region, farmers and herdsmen in Labuleng sold over 100,000 jin of wool in June alone. Herdsmen from Hongwan and Jingyao townships in the Sunan Yugur Autonomous Region sold nearly 10,000 jin of wool. After selling wool, farmers and herdsmen in various regions purchased means of production and daily necessities from state-owned trading companies, grain companies, and supply and marketing cooperatives. Before the wool season began, the Xihai Gu Hui Autonomous Region branch of the state-owned trading company transferred a large quantity of general merchandise from Xi'an to supply the masses. In May alone, the variety of fabrics increased by more than twenty types. In addition to supplying various colored fabrics favored by herdsmen, state-owned trading organizations in the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Region also prepared a quantity of wool shears, axes, and kitchen knives.

    甘肃省各地牧民
    及时把羊毛卖给国家
    甘肃省各地牧民及时把羊毛卖给国家。到六月底为止，各地牧民出卖的羊毛已有二百七十五万多斤，其中西海固回族自治区的农、牧民出卖细羊毛五十多万斤。甘南藏族自治区拉卜楞的农、牧民，仅在六月份就出卖羊毛十万多斤。肃南裕固族自治区红湾、景耀两个乡的牧民出卖的羊毛近万斤。各地农、牧民卖出羊毛后，都在国营贸易公司、粮食公司、供销合作社购买了生产资料和生活用品。国营贸易公司西海固回族自治区分公司，在羊毛上市前，从西安调运了大批日用百货供应群众，五月份仅布匹一项就增加了二十多种。甘南藏族自治区国营贸易机构除供应牧民所喜爱的各色布匹外，还准备了一部分羊毛剪子、斧头和菜刀等。
