	New Ramie from Various Regions Enters the Market Successively

	New ramie from various regions has successively entered the market. The Central-South region, which accounts for more than 70% of the country's total ramie production, saw new ramie enter the market in mid-May. New ramie from Anhui and Zhejiang in East China, and Sichuan and Guizhou in Southwest China, has now successively entered the market.

	The total output of ramie in the first season this year (ramie yields three seasons a year, and four seasons in some areas) is estimated to increase by about 15% compared with the same season last year. Encouraged by the enthusiasm to support national industrial construction, the broad masses of peasants are actively selling ramie to state-owned companies and supply and marketing cooperatives. As of early June, key producing areas such as Hubei, Hunan, and Guangxi provinces in the Central-South region had purchased more than 10,000 dan of ramie. The Daye branch of the China Native Produce Company purchased more than 67,900 jin of ramie in the first five days of June.

    各地新苎麻陆续上市
    各地新苎麻已陆续上市。苎麻产量占全国总产量百分之七十以上的中南区，在五月中旬即有新苎麻上市；华东区的安徽、浙江，西南区的四川、贵州等地的新苎麻现已相继登场。
    今年第一季苎麻总产量（苎麻年产三季，有的地区产四季），估计将比去年同季增加百分之十五左右。广大农民在支持国家工业建设的热情鼓舞下，踊跃把苎麻卖给国营公司和供销合作社。截至六月上旬止，中南区的湖北、湖南、广西等省重点产区已收购了一万余担苎麻。中国土产公司大冶分公司在六月份前五天，即收购苎麻六万七千九百多斤。
