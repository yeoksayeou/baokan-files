    The National Cooperative Congress Continues
    All Attendees Cheer for Indochina Ceasefire
    The First National Congress of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives continued its sessions on the 21st. The congress heard three reports and one review opinion in the morning; in the afternoon, groups discussed the reports.
    The number of delegates attending today's meeting has increased to 554.
    Amidst warm applause and music, cooperative delegations from the Soviet Union, Mongolia, the German Democratic Republic, North Korea, Czechoslovakia, and Romania, who had traveled from afar to attend the congress, entered the venue.
    Ye Jizhuang, Director of the Provisional Supervisory Committee of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives, delivered a work report on the Provisional Supervisory Committee of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives.
    The report provided a brief account of the work of the Provisional Supervisory Committee in inspection, review of statements and reports, and promotion of democratic supervision over the past few years. The report stated that this work has played a certain role in correcting capitalist management ideas, protecting cooperative property, promoting the enthusiasm of mass supervision, and establishing systems to improve work. The report also pointed out some shortcomings in the work.
    The report believes that the work of supply and marketing and consumer cooperatives nationwide in the past four years has basically conformed to the spirit of the Second Plenary Session and the Third Plenary Session of the Chinese Communist Party, and to the guidelines proposed by the Workers' Representative Conference of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives in 1950. The supply and marketing and consumer cooperatives have played a significant role in the recovery and development of the national economy in the past four years. At the same time, the report also pointed out some shortcomings and errors in the work of supply and marketing and consumer cooperatives in the past four years. These are: the implementation of the principle of serving agricultural production is not firm enough, and there are some capitalist management ideas of varying degrees; in procurement operations, some areas exhibit a task-oriented perspective; financial accounting is still far from meeting the requirements of business development; insufficient respect for the unified leadership of state-owned commerce on the commercial front; and the work in promoting democratic management and democratic supervision is still very poor, etc.
    The report believes that the three basic tasks of supply and marketing cooperatives proposed by the Provisional Council based on the overall task of the state during the transition period, as well as the measures proposed to implement these three basic tasks, are correct, practical, and necessary.
    Finally, the report proposed that the basic tasks of the supervisory committee in the future are: to conduct inspections based on the provisions of the federation's charter and the responsibilities of the supervisory committee, focusing on supervising and inspecting the implementation of national policies, laws, and the basic tasks of supply and marketing cooperatives during the transition period by the council; secondly, to strictly supervise and inspect the implementation of financial plans, business plans, and contract agreements of the federation's various business units.
    Subsequently, Liang Yao, Vice-Chairman of the Provisional Council of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives, delivered a report on the balance sheet as of December 31, 1953, on behalf of the Provisional Council. The report stated that the financial situation of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives itself has rapidly developed and tended to stabilize with the expansion of its business. Over the past three years, its own capital has increased by 9.94 times, and its proportion of the total capital has increased from 6.8 percent to 27 percent. The report also proposed a surplus distribution plan for 1953, with public accumulation funds accounting for 69 percent.
    Yu Shude, Vice-Chairman of the Provisional Supervisory Committee of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives, presented a review opinion on this report on behalf of the Provisional Supervisory Committee. He said that the balance sheet of the Provisional Council as of December 31, 1953, has been verified and proven to be true, and the proposed surplus distribution plan is also practical; agreeing to this report.
    Zhang Qilong, Vice-Chairman of the Provisional Council of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives, delivered an explanatory report on the draft charter of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives.
    The report stated that the draft charter stipulates the nature, tasks, organizational principles of supply and marketing cooperatives, as well as various necessary measures taken to achieve its tasks. It pointed out that supply and marketing cooperatives are collective economic organizations of the laboring people under the leadership of the working class and the management of the state power, and are economic entities of a socialist nature. Therefore, supply and marketing cooperatives must accept the absolute leadership of the Communist Party, accept the leadership of state commercial leading organs, and operate in accordance with state commercial policies under the state's unified plan, so as to promote the development of agricultural production increase movement centered on mutual assistance and cooperation, and support the country's socialist industrialization. The report also pointed out that in understanding the nature of supply and marketing cooperatives, it is necessary to clarify the mass character of supply and marketing cooperatives. The report quoted Chairman Mao's instruction in his discussion on cooperatives: "The nature of cooperatives is to serve the masses, that is, to think of the masses everywhere, to plan for the masses, and to put the interests of the masses first," to illustrate that cooperatives can only be run well by relying on the enthusiastic support and active participation of the members.
    The report pointed out that in understanding the nature and tasks of supply and marketing cooperatives, it is also necessary to clarify the commonality and differences between supply and marketing cooperatives and state-owned commerce. The report said that state-owned commerce and supply and marketing cooperatives are both socialist economies and carry out business operations in accordance with the laws of the socialist economy. Their objects and purposes of struggle are consistent. However, state-owned commerce is owned by the whole people, while supply and marketing cooperative commerce is collectively owned by the members. Therefore, it determines that state-owned commerce and supply and marketing cooperatives are different in organizational systems, management and supervision, capital structure, and surplus distribution. Organizationally, state-owned commerce is a whole, and its operating units established in various places are its branches, while supply and marketing cooperatives are organizations voluntarily united by decentralized cooperatives that are responsible for their own profits and losses, and become an organized whole. In terms of management principles, state-owned commerce has a one-leader system, while supply and marketing cooperatives take the general meeting of members or the congress of representatives as the highest authority, which elects the council as its executive body and is supervised by the supervisory committee elected by the general meeting of members or the congress of representatives. In terms of capital structure, state-owned commerce is funded by state budget appropriations, and its enterprise profits also become a component of state fiscal revenue, while supply and marketing cooperatives are mainly funded by their own funds, and the surplus earned, after paying income tax to the state, is collectively owned by the members. This difference will exist for a considerable period of time. However, the report also pointed out that although these two types of commerce have their own independence in organization, supply and marketing cooperatives must also obey the leadership of state commercial leading organs and become a powerful assistant to state-owned commerce, and must not be opposed to it. Regarding the basic tasks of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives stipulated in the draft charter, the report pointed out that its central content is to organize and lead the national supply and marketing cooperatives to do a good job in supply and marketing operations in a planned way.
    These basic spirits of the nature and tasks of supply and marketing cooperatives run through every part of the draft charter.
    The report then explained the rights and obligations of members stipulated in the draft charter. The report said that the draft charter stipulates that members' admission and withdrawal from the cooperative are entirely voluntary, which is in line with the principle that cooperatives are economic organizations voluntarily organized by the masses, and it fully expresses the democratic system of supply and marketing cooperatives.
    The provisions on the obligations of members in the draft charter are to ensure that the economic organizations of the masses, which are responsible for their own profits and losses, become a strong economic organization as a whole. The various rights of members stipulated in the draft charter are to give full play to the enthusiasm and initiative of members in participating in cooperative activities, so as to realize the democratic system of supply and marketing cooperatives, ensure the democratic rights of members, and thus promote the continuous improvement and enhancement of the work of supply and marketing cooperatives. At the same time, these provisions also embody the spirit that higher-level cooperatives must serve lower-level cooperatives and cooperatives must serve members, which is in line with the principle that supply and marketing cooperatives are the economic organizations of the members themselves.
    The draft charter stipulates that the organizational principle of supply and marketing cooperatives is democratic centralism. The report pointed out that the basic content of democratic centralism is: the leading organs of the cooperative are democratically elected from bottom to top by the congress of representatives and regularly report their work to the members; the council of the cooperative conducts its work in accordance with the charter and resolutions passed by the congress of representatives; at various meetings, the minority obeys the majority, and resolutions must be passed by at least half of those present to be valid; lower-level cooperatives obey higher-level cooperatives, etc. The report also pointed out that the independent accounting of supply and marketing cooperatives must be combined with unified leadership; collective leadership is one of the main contents of democratic centralism, and the leaders of cooperatives at all levels must strictly abide by this highest leadership principle.
    The draft charter stipulates that the current All-China Federation of Cooperatives will be renamed the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives. The report pointed out that this will be of great significance for the continued development and improvement of the cause of supply and marketing cooperatives in the future.
    Finally, the report also gave a brief explanation of the provisions on the funds and profits and losses of supply and marketing cooperatives in the draft charter.
    After Zhang Qilong's report, the executive chairman of the congress read out the congratulatory message from the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League to the congress.
    In the afternoon, the congress held group discussions on the work report of the Provisional Council, the work report of the Provisional Supervisory Committee, and the report on the balance sheet as of December 31, 1953.
    The congress will continue on the 22nd. (Xinhua News Agency)
    Xinhua News Agency, July 22nd - At the First National Congress of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives on the 22nd, all attendees celebrated the signing of the agreement on the cessation of hostilities in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. After the executive chairman of the congress reported this news, applause resounded throughout the conference hall. The executive chairman said that this is another great victory achieved by the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union in striving for peace and opposing the war policy of US imperialism, after achieving the great victory of the Korean armistice, and it is also a great victory for the peace-loving people of the world. He proposed that all the representatives, representing more than 160 million members, stand up and extend the warmest congratulations to the Vietnamese delegation and the great Vietnamese people attending the congress. Thunderous applause rang out again. Amidst applause and cheers, the representatives attending the congress lifted up the three representatives from Vietnam.
    Delegations from the Soviet Union, Mongolia, the German Democratic Republic, North Korea, Czechoslovakia, and Romania all followed suit to congratulate the Vietnamese delegation, embracing and kissing each other warmly.
    Bui Bao Van, head of the Vietnamese delegation, spoke at the congress, thanking everyone for their warm congratulations. He said that this victory is a heavy blow to the enemies of peace. Our task is to strive for the democracy and unity of Vietnam and maintain vigilance against the enemies of peace.
    At today's congress, the Soviet Cooperative Delegation delivered a congratulatory message to the congress. Finally, they presented the congress with a set of stationery specially manufactured by the cooperative factory for the congress. The stationery stand had a spectacular image of Moscow University.
    Delegations from North Korea, Czechoslovakia, and Romania followed suit to deliver congratulatory messages to the congress and presented the congress with gifts and pennants.
    At today's congress, representatives from Hebei, Xikang, Shanghai, Hunan, Jilin, Shanxi, Ningxia, and Jiangsu and other places spoke. They unanimously agreed with the report of the Provisional Council and raised criticisms of certain shortcomings in the All-China Federation of Cooperatives and local cooperative organizations.
    Today, the congress approved the report of the Credentials Committee on the results of the credentials review. There should have been 574 delegates attending the First National Congress of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives, with 560 delegates actually attending, and 14 delegates were absent due to various reasons. The delegates included cooperative representatives from 13 ethnic minorities including the Mongolian, Hui, Tibetan, Uyghur, Korean, Manchu, Miao, Yao, Li, Zhuang, Buyi, Mosi, and Kazakh. Among the delegates, a large number were outstanding members supported by the members, with a total of 187 people who have won various medals, certificates, and prizes. (Xinhua News Agency)

    全国合作社代表大会继续举行
    全体到会者欢呼印度支那停火
    中华全国合作社第一次代表大会二十一日继续举行会议。大会在上午听取了三个报告和一个审查意见的发言；下午分组就各项报告进行讨论。
    出席今天大会的代表已增至五百五十四名。
    在热烈的鼓掌声中和乐曲声中，从远道赶来参加大会的苏联、蒙古、德意志民主共和国、朝鲜、捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚等国合作社代表团进入会场。
    中华全国合作社联合总社临时监事会主任叶季壮向大会作了中华全国合作社联合总社临时监事会工作报告。
    报告就临时监事会几年来在检查工作、审查表报和发扬民主监督等方面的情况，作了扼要的说明。报告说，这些工作对纠正资本主义经营思想，保护合作社财产，发扬群众监督的积极性和建立制度改进工作，都起了一定的作用。报告也指出了在工作中存在的一些缺点。
    报告认为四年来全国供销、消费合作社的工作，基本上符合于中国共产党二中全会和三中全会决议的精神，符合于一九五零年中华全国合作社工作者代表会议所提出的方针。四年来的供销、消费合作社对于国民经济的恢复和发展，起了巨大的作用。同时，报告也指出了四年来供销、消费合作社工作中的一些缺点和错误。这就是：贯彻执行为农业生产服务的方针不够坚决，并存有某些不同程度的资本主义经营思想；在收购业务上在某些地区表现有任务观点；在财务会计方面还远赶不上业务发展的要求；对国营商业在商业战线上的统一领导方面尊重不够；在发扬民主管理、民主监督方面做的还很差等等。
    报告认为临时理事会根据国家过渡时期总任务所提出的供销合作社三个基本任务以及为贯彻这三个基本任务而提出的措施，都是正确的、切合实际和必要的。
    报告最后提出监事会今后的基本任务是：根据本社章程、监事会职责的规定进行检查，并着重于监督、检查理事会对国家政策、法令和过渡时期供销合作社基本任务的贯彻执行情况；其次，是严格监督和检查本社各企业单位的财务计划、业务计划以及合同协议等的执行情况。
    接着，中华全国合作社联合总社临时理事会副主任梁耀代表临时理事会向大会作了关于一九五三年十二月三十一日资产负债表的报告。报告说，中华全国合作社联合总社本身的财务状况随着业务的扩大而迅速发展并趋向稳固了。三年来自有资金增加九点九四倍，所占资金总额比重已由百分之六点八提高到百分之二十七。报告并提出了一九五三年盈余分配案，其中公积金占百分之六十九。
    中华全国合作社联合总社临时监事会副主任于树德代表临时监事会对这个报告提出审查意见。他说，临时理事会公布的一九五三年十二月三十一日的资产负债表经过审查证明属实，所提盈余分配方案也切合实际；同意这个报告。
    中华全国合作社联合总社临时理事会副主任张启龙向大会作了关于制定中华全国供销合作总社章程草案的说明报告。
    报告说，在章程草案中规定了供销合作社的性质、任务、组织原则以及为了实现其任务所采取的各项必要措施。它指出，供销合作社是在工人阶级领导的、国家政权管理之下的、劳动人民群众的集体经济组织，是属于社会主义性质的经济。因此供销合作社必须接受共产党的绝对领导，接受国家商业领导机关的领导，并在国家统一计划下，遵守国家商业政策经营业务，以促进以互助合作为中心的农业增产运动的发展，支援国家的社会主义工业化。报告并指出，在认识供销合作社的性质上，必须明确供销合作社的群众性。报告引用毛主席在论合作社中所指示的“合作社性质就是为群众服务，这就是要处处想到群众，为群众打算，把群众利益放在第一位”，来说明必须依靠社员群众的热烈拥护和积极参加，才能把合作社办好。
    报告指出在认识供销合作社的性质和任务上，还必须明确供销合作社和国营商业的共同性和区别性。报告说，国营商业和供销合作社都是社会主义经济，都是服从社会主义经济法则进行业务工作的。它们的斗争对象和目的是一致的。但国营商业是全民所有制，供销合作社商业是社员的集体所有制。因此，就决定了国营商业和供销合作社在组织系统上、管理和监督上、资金构成以及盈余分配上都有所不同。在组织上，国营商业是一个整体，它在各地设立的经营单位是其分支机构，供销合作社却是由分散的各负盈亏的合作社自愿联合起来的组织，而成为有组织的整体。在管理原则上，国营商业是一长制，供销合作社是以社员大会或代表大会为最高权力机关，由它选举出理事会为其执行机关，并且受由社员大会或代表大会选举出的监事会的监察。在资金构成上，国营商业是由国家预算拨款，其企业利润也成为国家财政收入的一个组成部分，供销合作社是以自有资金为主，所得盈余除向国家缴纳所得税外，其余就为社员群众集体所有。这种区别在一个相当长的时期中都是要存在的。但是，报告又指出，这两种商业在组织上虽各有其独立性，可是供销合作社还必须服从国家商业领导机关的领导，成为国营商业的有力助手，决不能与之对立。关于章程草案规定的中华全国供销合作总社的基本任务，报告指出它的中心内容就是组织领导全国供销合作社有计划地做好供销业务。
    这些供销合作社的性质、任务的基本精神贯串在章程草案的每一个部分中。
    报告接着解释了章程草案中规定的社员的权利和义务。报告说，在章程草案中作了社员入社、退社都完全出于自愿的规定，这是符合于合作社是群众自愿组织起来的经济组织的原则的，它充分表示了供销合作社的民主制度。
    在章程草案中关于社员义务的规定，是为了保证各负盈亏的群众的经济组织成为一个强有力的经济组织的整体。在章程草案中规定的社员各项权利，是为了充分发挥社员参加合作社活动的积极性和主动性，以实现供销合作社的民主制度，确保社员的民主权利，从而推动供销合作社工作的不断改进和提高。同时这些规定也体现着上级社必须为下级社服务、合作社必须为社员服务的精神，符合于供销合作社是社员群众自己的经济组织的原则。
    章程草案规定了供销合作社的组织原则是民主集中制。报告指出民主集中制的基本内容是：合作社的领导机关是从下而上地由代表大会民主选举产生的，并定期向社员报告工作；合作社理事会按照代表大会通过的章程和决议进行工作；在各种会议上少数服从多数，各项决议至少须经到会半数的通过方为有效；下级合作社服从上级合作社等。报告又指出，供销合作社的独立核算必须和统一领导相结合；集体领导是民主集中制的主要内容之一，各级合作社的领导人必须严格遵守这一最高领导原则。
    章程草案规定将现在的中华全国合作社联合总社改名为中华全国供销合作总社。报告指出，这对于今后供销合作社事业的继续发展和提高，将有重大意义。
    报告最后对章程草案中关于供销合作社的资金和盈亏问题的规定也作了扼要地解释说明。
    张启龙报告后，大会执行主席宣读了中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会给大会的贺词。
    下午，大会分组就临时理事会工作报告、临时监事会工作报告及一九五三年十二月三十一日资产负债表的报告进行讨论。
    大会在二十二日将继续举行。　　（新华社）
