    New Market Town on the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway Line

    The train departs from Chongqing and travels west along the Yangtze River for forty-five kilometers, where you can see a cluster of new white-walled, red-tiled houses built on the hillside, with tall chimneys spewing smoke into the sky. A passenger told me that this is Dongs笋ba, where the Tongguanyi Station is located, a new market town that has grown up along with the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway.

    Before the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway extended to Tongguanyi, this area was a desolate cemetery with a population of just over a hundred people. Now, it has become a bustling market town with more than a thousand households and a population of six thousand. Several new streets have been built here, and the People's Bank, cooperatives, post office, and state-owned trading companies have established branches. The original earthen brick kiln, with only twenty or so workers, has been expanded into a mechanized brick and tile factory with more than 1,200 workers. Thanks to convenient transportation, the factory's production has grown year by year, supplying hundreds of thousands of tons of bricks and tiles to basic construction departments in Chongqing, Chengdu, and other places over the years. This new market town is also constructing or planning to build a canning factory, a sweet orange packaging plant, and a chemical fertilizer plant.

    Tongguanyi Station is located close to the north bank of the Yangtze River, across from the Qijiang Railway, making both water and land transportation very convenient. It serves as a hub for material exchange between Sichuan and Guizhou provinces. Since the opening of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, hundreds of tons of salt, cloth, general merchandise, and other goods are transported here daily to Qijiang and Guizhou. Thousands of tons of coal, iron, ore, timber, and other materials are also transported out of the Qijiang Railway, passing through here and being transshipped to Chongqing, Chengdu, and all parts of the country.

    When the reporter entered Tongguanyi Station, the railway tracks were piled high with goods. Porters formed long lines, transporting goods back and forth continuously, and dozens of cargo boats shuttled back and forth across the Yangtze River, transporting materials to both banks. Lian Changcheng, the freight foreman at the station, told the reporter that the amount of goods coming here is increasing day by day. Two years ago, it was just a small fourth-class station, shipping only a few dozen tons of goods per day, and there were not many passengers. Now, both passengers and goods have increased many times over. This station has actually become the station with the largest freight volume on the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway. The average monthly freight volume for the first five months of this year accounts for almost one-third of the total freight volume of the entire Chengdu-Chongqing Railway. Although the station has been expanded year after year, it is still not enough. Recently, even the railway workers' ball field had to be used to store goods.

    The areas of Ba County and Jiangjin near Tongguanyi Station produce abundant rice, wheat, fruits, and Chinese kale. The annual production of Guanggan oranges and tangerines reaches several thousand tons, which are sold at home and abroad. In the past two years, with the development of railway transportation, these materials have found a good market. Last year, farmers in the first district of Ba County sold more than ten million tangerines, and even the tangerine peels were sold for tens of thousands of jin. Zhang Daozhen Mutual Aid Group in Shengli Village sold Chinese kale worth more than 100 million yuan last year, averaging five to six million yuan per household. The brisk sales of agricultural products have greatly increased the farmers' enthusiasm for production. In addition to ensuring the output of grain and cash crops, farmers are expanding the planting area of fruits, Chinese kale, and various by-products. This spring, the first district of Ba County planted more than 20,000 banana plants and plans to add another 40,000 tangerine trees. Tongguan Township is actively preparing to establish a fruit production cooperative.

### 成渝线上的新集镇

    成渝线上的新集镇
    新华社记者  吕希林
    火车从重庆出发，沿长江向西行进四十五公里，就可以看到一片建筑在山坡上的白墙红瓦的新房屋，高耸的烟囱在上空喷吐着烟。一位旅客告诉我，这就是随着成渝铁路成长起来的新集镇——铜罐驿车站所在的冬笋坝。
    成渝铁路还没有通车到冬笋坝的时候，这里是一片荒凉的坟地，全部居民不过一百多人，而现在已经成为一个拥有一千多户人家、六千多人口的热闹集镇了。这里新修了好几条大街，人民银行、合作社、邮局和国营贸易公司都在这里建立了分支机构。过去只有二十多个工人的土砖窑，现在已扩建成为一个有一千二百多个工人的机制砖瓦厂。由于运输条件的方便，这个厂的生产一年比一年发展，几年来已给重庆、成都等地基本建设部门供应了几十万吨砖瓦。这个新集镇还正在建设或计划建设罐头工厂、甜橙包装厂、化学肥料厂。
    铜罐驿车站紧靠长江北岸，隔江可以遥望綦江铁路，水陆运输都很方便，是四川、贵州两省物资交流的枢纽。成渝铁路通车以来，每天都有几百吨食盐、布匹、百货等经过这里运往綦江、贵州，成千上万吨的煤、铁、矿砂、木材等也从綦江铁路运出来，经过这里转运到重庆、成都和全国各地。
    当记者走进铜罐驿车站的时候，铁路两旁堆满了物资，搬运工人们排成长长的行列往来不停地运输，几十艘载重木船穿梭似地来回向长江两岸运送物资。车站上的货运领班连昌诚告诉记者，这里的货物一天比一天来得更多了。前年这里还是一个四等小站，每天不过送出几十吨货物，来往的客人也不多，现在旅客和货物都已增加了好多倍。这个车站实际上已经成为成渝铁路线上货运量最大的车站。今年头五个月平均每月发送的货物，差不多要占成渝铁路全线发送货物的三分之一。虽然车站年年都在扩建，但总是不敷应用，最近甚至连铁路职工们的球场也不得不用来存放货物了。
    铜罐驿车站附近巴县、江津一带出产丰富的大米、小麦、水果和荩菜。广柑和橘子年产达几千吨，远销国内外。近两年来，随着铁路运输的发展，这些物资都有了很好的销路。去年巴县第一区农民销售的橘子达一千多万只，连橘子皮也出售了好几万斤。胜利村张道珍互助组去年卖出的荩菜共值一亿多元，平均每户分得五、六百万。农产品畅销，大大提高了农民的生产积极性。农民们除保证粮食和经济作物的产量外，正在扩大水果、荩菜和各种副产品的种植面积。今年春季巴县第一区新种上了两万多株香蕉，还要再增加四万多株橘子树。铜罐乡正在积极筹备成立水果生产合作社。
