Notice from the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government to All Regions:
    Promote Detasseling, Seed Selection, and Artificial Pollination Methods to Increase Corn Yield
    The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government issued a notice on July 3rd, requiring all regions to promote methods such as detasseling corn for seed selection, artificial pollination, and inter-varietal hybridization to increase corn yields.
    The notice stated: Detasseling corn for seed selection and artificial pollination are advanced Soviet experiences and are an economical and effective measure to improve corn yield and quality at present. According to the results of experiments, research, and demonstration promotions in various parts of our country over the past few years, corn that has undergone detasseling and pollination can generally increase production by more than 5% in the same year; using corn from detasseled and pollinated corn as seeds can increase production by 7% to 10%. To this end, major corn-producing areas should continue to earnestly promote these yield-increasing technologies in areas where detasseling and pollination demonstrations have been successful, so that the majority of farmers can apply this yield-increasing technology. In areas where there is no experience in detasseling and pollination, key contrast demonstrations should first be carried out in farms or agricultural production cooperatives and year-round mutual aid teams to prepare conditions for expanding promotion next year. Now is the peak growing season for corn, and all regions should seize the opportunity to widely publicize the scientific rationale for increasing production through detasseling and pollination, and specifically teach the technical methods of detasseling and pollination, in order to expand the area of increased production.
    Utilizing the heterosis of corn hybrids is one of the important methods to increase corn yield. Some farms have carried out inter-varietal hybridization of corn and promoted first-generation hybrid seeds, which have achieved significant yield increases and have been welcomed by the masses. Therefore, farms in major corn-producing areas should immediately investigate the characteristics of local excellent corn varieties in order to conduct comparative experiments on hybrid combinations next year. If some farms have already selected excellent varieties, artificial pollination methods can be used for seed production to provide materials for comparative experiments next year, so that this method can be rapidly expanded and applied.

    中央人民政府农业部通知各地
    推行去雄选种、人工授粉方法提高玉米产量
    中央人民政府农业部七月三日发出通知，要求各地推行玉米去雄选种人工辅助授粉及品种间杂交的办法，以提高玉米产量。
    通知说：玉米去雄选种和人工辅助授粉，是苏联的先进经验，为目前提高玉米产量与品质的一项经济而有效的措施。根据几年来我国各地试验研究和示范推广结果，玉米经过去雄授粉，一般当年可增产百分之五以上；用去雄授粉的玉米作种，可增产百分之七至百分之十。为此，各主要玉米产区在去雄授粉示范成功的地区，应继续认真推广，使广大农民都能应用这一增产技术。在尚无去雄授粉经验的地区，应先在农场或农业生产合作社及常年互助组有重点地做好对比示范，为明年扩大推广准备条件。现在正是玉米生长盛期，各地应抓紧时机广泛宣传去雄授粉增产的科学道理，具体传授去雄授粉的技术方法，以扩大增产面积。
    利用玉米杂交优势是提高玉米产量的重要方法之一，有些农场进行玉米品种间杂交，推广杂交第一代种子，已获得显著增产效果，受到群众欢迎。因此，在主要玉米产区的农场，应即调查当地玉米优良品种的特性，以便明年进行杂交组合的比较试验。如有的农场已选有优良品种，即可用人工授粉方法进行制种，以供明年比较试验材料，使这一方法迅速扩大应用。
