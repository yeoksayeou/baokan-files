    State Council Finance and Economics Committee Directs All Regions to Resolutely Complete Cotton Production Increase Task

    [Our Newspaper] The State Council Finance and Economics Committee of the Central People's Government issued a directive on July 6, demanding that all regions resolutely guarantee the completion and strive to overfulfill the cotton production increase task. The directive stated:

    The national cotton planting plan task has been successfully overfulfilled due to the importance attached by party and government leaders and the efforts of cadres at all levels, who overcame various difficulties. However, due to generally high rainfall and low temperatures in cotton-growing areas in the past two months, especially continuous heavy rain in the south, some cotton-growing areas have suffered from waterlogging and mountain floods; in addition, cotton field pests and diseases have occurred earlier and more widely this year, with seedling diseases being quite serious in cotton-growing areas such as Northeast China, Hebei, Shandong, and Henan; furthermore, many regions did not do enough preparatory work for cotton planting this year, the quality of seeds was poor, and planting was rough, which affected emergence. As a result, the following problems have occurred in cotton production: the area of cotton fields that have been changed or destroyed in many regions exceeds that of previous years; the phenomenon of missing seedlings in cotton fields is serious; under the influence of rain, waterlogging, pests and diseases, the emerged cotton seedlings are also growing poorly and developing slower than in previous years, especially in some cotton-growing areas in the south where planting has been delayed due to rain, or weeding and thinning have not been carried out in time, resulting in serious grass and seedling shortages, which threatens to reduce production and delay maturity. These situations have formed a great threat to the realization of this year's cotton production increase task. Therefore, all regions urgently need to take effective measures to further strengthen specific leadership over cotton production in response to the current unfavorable conditions, resolutely guarantee the completion and strive to overfulfill this year's national cotton production increase plan. For this purpose, the following instructions are given:

    1. At present, all cotton-growing areas must first organize forces to drain waterlogging, eliminate pests and diseases, and minimize the adverse effects of cotton field destruction, missing seedlings, and cotton plant development. The unit area yield increase plan for cotton fields must be guaranteed and strived to exceed. It is especially important for areas where the total cotton production task is affected due to the destruction of some cotton fields to strive for overfulfillment of the unit area yield. This is the common goal of cadres at all levels and the vast number of cotton farmers in cotton-producing areas; local leaders, especially agricultural departments, must be held accountable for this and make the greatest effort to ensure the completion of the task throughout the entire growing period of cotton.

    2. In the case of more rainfall and the generally slow development of cotton in the early stage this year, it is necessary to strengthen cotton field management, especially to correctly implement pruning techniques, so as to minimize the impact of waterlogging, reduce boll shedding, and prevent late maturity and excessive growth. Waterlogged cotton fields should be urgently drained to protect seedlings, and the masses should be organized to clear drainage ditches in cotton fields, and often pay attention to doing intertillage weeding and combining it with earthing up. In northern cotton areas where pruning is already customary, it is necessary to further implement fine pruning, promote the method of topping clusters, and pay attention to late pruning and pruning during continuous rain. In southern cotton areas, where pruning is generally not customary, it is necessary to widely teach pruning methods, organize forces to specifically guide the masses to promote this technology.

    3. To prevent and control cotton field pests and diseases, it is necessary to effectively solve the preparation and supply of medicines and machinery. For cotton aphids, red spiders, and other pests that are currently widespread, it is necessary to specifically organize and mobilize the masses to comprehensively and intensively implement prevention and control. At the same time, preparations should be made ideologically, technically, in terms of medicines and machinery, and organizationally as early as possible for the prevention and control of bollworms in the future boll stage, and the prevention and control area should be expanded as much as possible. Agricultural departments at all levels should assist supply and marketing cooperatives in actively doing a good job in the supply of medicines and machinery, overcoming the passive attitude of not actively supplying them for fear of stockpiling and losses. It is necessary to prepare sufficient medicines and machinery to the best of our ability according to the actual needs of production, and adopt methods that are convenient for the masses to accept, and promote sales in large quantities or lend them to farmers for use in conjunction with agricultural loans. Technical extension stations in cotton-growing areas should also actively help cotton farmers who are unable to purchase medicines and machinery to control pests and diseases, and widely teach and guide prevention and control techniques, and organize the broad masses to actively take action to fight against pests and diseases. Agricultural and cooperative departments at all levels should quickly distribute any accumulated medicines and machinery; if necessary, the provincial agricultural department may decide to transfer and supply medicines and machinery for locust control to control cotton pests, and replenish and return them later. In order to fully utilize existing medicines and machinery to exert the effect of pest control, the provincial agricultural department may negotiate to appropriately reduce prices for promotion, and the losses will be adjusted and resolved by the provincial agricultural department in the provincial agricultural funds.

    4. Organize cotton farmers to appropriately apply topdressing fertilizer to cotton fields as early as possible to promote the normal development of cotton plants and increase yields. Especially in the southern cotton area, on the one hand, cotton fields are mainly cultivated with two crops a year, and base fertilizer is generally not applied before planting cotton. At the same time, there has been particularly heavy rainfall this year, and most of the limited fertilizer in the soil has also been washed away, and the lack of fertilizer is even more serious. Therefore, it is more important to universally apply topdressing fertilizer. Agricultural departments and cooperative departments in cotton-growing areas should strive to find fertilizer sources. Existing commercial fertilizers should be mainly allocated to cotton-growing areas, and the mastered cake fertilizer raw materials should also be processed in advance and supplied to cotton-growing areas. In addition to adopting fast-acting fertilizers and grasping the principle of early application, it is necessary to guide the implementation of ditching or digging holes for deep application to fully exert the effect of fertilizer.

    5. This year's task of increasing cotton production is very arduous. Some of the unfavorable factors that currently exist still have time and conditions to be overcome. Therefore, whether the task can be completed mainly depends on leadership. All cotton-growing areas should immediately formulate effective measures to ensure this year's cotton production increase in light of local cotton production conditions and existing problems, strengthen specific organizational leadership, rely on agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams to take the lead, vigorously carry out implementation, and conduct timely inspections. In addition to doing a good job in the main cotton-growing areas, we should also pay attention to strengthening technical guidance to new cotton-growing areas and low-yield cotton-growing areas, and also attach importance to the increase in production in coarse-lint cotton-growing areas, in order to achieve a comprehensive increase in production and ensure the completion and overfulfillment of this year's cotton production increase plan task.

    政务院财政经济委员会指示各地
    坚决完成棉花增产任务
    【本报讯】中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会于七月六日发出指示，要求各地坚决保证完成并力争超额完成棉花增产任务。指示说：
    全国棉花播种计划任务，由于党政领导的重视和各级干部的努力，克服了各种困难，已胜利地超额完成。但由于近两月来棉区一般阴雨多，气温低，特别是南方连续霪雨，部分棉区已因内涝山洪成灾；另外，今年棉田病虫害也发生早而普遍，东北、河北、山东、河南等棉区苗期病害相当严重；再加今年不少地区种棉准备工作做得不够，种子质量差，播种粗糙，影响出苗。因而目前在棉花生产上发生以下问题：很多地区改毁的棉田面积超过往年；棉田缺苗现象严重；在雨、涝、病虫害等的影响下，已出的棉苗也生长不良，比往年发育的慢，特别是南方部分棉区因雨延迟播种，或未能及时除草、间苗，草荒、苗荒现象严重，大有减产晚熟的趋势。这些情况对实现今年棉花增产任务，已形成很大的威胁，因之，各地亟须针对当前所遭遇的不利条件，采取有效措施，进一步加强对棉花生产的具体领导，坚决保证完成并力争超额完成今年国家的棉花增产计划。为此，特作如下指示：
    一、目前各棉区首先要组织力量，排除水涝，除治病虫，尽量减少棉田毁弃、缺苗和对于棉株发育的不利影响。对棉田单位面积增产计划，必须保证完成并力争超过。因毁弃了一部分棉田而影响棉产总任务的地方，争取单位面积产量的超额完成尤为重要。这是产棉区各级干部和广大棉农共同奋斗的目标；要责成地方领导特别是农业部门对此切实负责，在棉花整个生长时期内，尽最大努力保证完成任务。
    二、在雨水较多及今年棉花前期一般发育缓慢的情况下，必须加强棉田管理工作，特别是正确地实施整枝技术，以尽量克服水涝影响，减少蕾铃脱落，防止晚熟徒长。雨涝的棉田要加紧排渍保苗，组织群众清理棉田排水沟，经常注意做好中耕除草并结合培土工作。北方棉区已有整枝习惯的，要进一步实行精细整枝，推行打群尖的办法，并重视后期整枝和连雨期间的整枝。南方棉区一般尚无整枝习惯，要广泛传授整枝方法，组织力量具体指导群众推广这一技术。
    三、防治棉田病虫害，要切实地解决药械的准备和供应工作。对目前普遍为害的棉蚜、红蜘蛛等，必须具体组织和动员群众，全面地加紧实施防治，同时对于今后蕾铃期害虫的防治，也要及早作好思想上、技术上、药械上、组织上的准备，尽量扩大防治面积。各级农业部门要协助供销合作社积极作好药械供应工作，克服因为怕积压怕赔累而不积极供应的消极态度，必须根据生产上的实际需要，尽力准备足够的药械，采取便利群众接受的方式，大量推销或结合农业贷款贷给农民使用。棉区的技术推广站更要积极帮助那些无力置备药械的棉农除治虫害，并广泛地传授和指导防治技术，组织广大群众积极行动起来与病虫害作斗争。各级农业、合作部门尚有积存的药械应即速分配下去；必要时，各地储备治蝗的药械亦可由省农业厅决定调供防治棉虫之用，以后补购归还。为了充分利用现有药械发挥治虫的效果，并可由省农业厅商妥适当地减价推销，其亏赔的损失，由各省农业部门在省农业经费中调剂解决。
    四、组织棉农及早在棉田适当增施追肥，以促进棉株正常发育，提高产量。特别在南方棉区，一方面因棉田以两熟栽培为主，种棉前一般不施基肥，同时今年雨水特多，土壤中有限的肥分亦大半冲刷流失，缺肥更为严重，故普遍增施追肥更为重要。棉区农业部门和合作部门应努力寻找肥源，现有的商品肥料要重点分配棉区，已掌握的饼肥原料也要设法提前加工，供应棉区。增施追肥除必须采用速效肥料及掌握早施的原则外，要指导实行开沟或挖穴深施的办法，以充分发挥肥料效用。
    五、今年棉花增产的任务是十分艰巨的。目前所存在的一些不利因素，都还是有时间并且有条件进行克服的。因此，任务的能否完成，主要关键决定于领导。各棉区应即针对当地棉花生产情况及存在的问题，因地制宜、因时制宜地定出保证今年棉花增产的有效措施；加强具体的组织领导工作，依靠农业生产合作社、互助组带头，大力进行贯彻，并及时进行检查。除做好主要棉区的工作外，同时要注意对新棉区和低产棉区加强技术指导，对粗绒棉区的增产，也要加以重视，以求获得全面增产，保证完成和超额完成今年棉花增产的计划任务。
