Xinhua News Agency, Moscow:
The talks between Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, and Jawaharlal Nehru, Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of India, concluded a few days ago. Politicians from the two largest countries in Asia met in Delhi, the capital of India, to discuss many issues of common concern to China and India. The two prime ministers expressed confidence in the friendship between China and India, which will contribute to the cause of world peace and the peaceful development of their respective countries and other countries in Asia. The purpose of these talks was to contribute to a greater understanding of Asian issues and to advance peaceful and cooperative efforts, in coordination with other countries in the world, to resolve these and similar issues. The two prime ministers agreed that China and India should maintain close contact so that the two countries can continue to maintain full understanding.

The "People's Daily" published an editorial on Zhou Enlai's visit to India, saying that this visit is of great significance for promoting friendly relations between China and India and consolidating peace in Asia and the world.

Indian newspapers expressed similar views. "The Hindustan Times" wrote in an editorial entitled "Peace in Asia": The talks between Zhou Enlai and Nehru "are of great significance for Asia and the whole world, because this meeting is the starting point of a stronger movement to strive for peace and unity in Asia..."

Zhou Enlai and Nehru gave considerable attention to the issue of Indochina in their talks. This is quite natural. The Indochina issue is currently being discussed at the Geneva Conference. Thanks to the efforts of the representatives of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in Geneva, a path has been pointed out leading to a ceasefire and a peaceful settlement of the Indochina issue. But this path does not suit the ruling groups of the United States, who are keen to maintain and deepen international tensions. At present, they are continuing to piece together aggressive blocs behind the backs of some major Asian countries in order to suppress the national liberation movements in Southeast Asia, especially to carry out open armed intervention in Indochina. Therefore, under such circumstances, the talks between the prime ministers of China and India are of greater significance, because the purpose of the talks is to make every possible effort to peacefully resolve all outstanding issues.

At the Geneva Conference, the voices of the true representatives of the Asian people were heard for the first time. The People's Republic of China participated in a broad international conference for the first time. The People's Republic of China has embarked on the road of socialism and become a strong country, and even those hostile countries that obstruct the People's Republic of China from obtaining its legitimate status in the United Nations with unreasonable obstruction policies cannot ignore it. It goes without saying that it is entirely natural and necessary for the People's Republic of China to participate in the discussion of pressing issues in Asia. Finally, at the Geneva Conference, the People's Republic of China achieved the status of one of the five major powers. The broad public sees this as an extremely important victory in the continuous struggle of the entire democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union to restore the legitimate rights of great China.

The delegation of the People's Republic of China, together with the delegations of the Soviet Union, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, firmly advocated a peaceful settlement of Asian issues on the basis of national independence, freedom, and democracy in Asian countries. In this regard, the proposal put forward by the delegation of the People's Republic of China and supported by the delegation of the Soviet Union is of great significance. This proposal is that Asian countries should consult with each other to jointly maintain peace and security in Asia by mutually undertaking appropriate obligations. Zhou Enlai reiterated at a press conference held in New Delhi, the capital of India, that "it is appropriate for the appropriate responsible persons of the major Asian countries to meet and consult with each other from time to time."

It was stated in the published statement that the main purpose of the Sino-Indian talks was to gain a clearer understanding of each other's views in order to cooperate with each other and with other countries to help maintain peace. This meeting shows that countries that desire peace can cooperate successfully regardless of whether their social systems are the same, as long as both parties are concerned about this cooperation and are sincere.

The participants in the Delhi talks stipulated some principles to guide relations between the two countries. These principles are the following five points: mutual respect for territorial sovereignty; mutual non-aggression; mutual non-interference in internal affairs; equality and mutual benefit; and peaceful coexistence. There is no doubt that if these extremely important principles are adopted by Asian countries and other countries, the danger of war can be reduced, the easing of international tensions can be promoted, and the possibility of cooperation between countries can be increased.

These principles have also received full support in other Asian countries. In their joint statement, Premier Zhou Enlai and Burmese Prime Minister U Nu, in referring to the principles agreed upon by China and India to guide relations between the two countries, pointed out: "These principles should also be the principles guiding relations between China and Burma. If these principles can be observed by all countries, then the peaceful coexistence of countries with different social systems will be guaranteed, and the threat of aggression and interference in internal affairs and the fear of aggression and interference in internal affairs will be replaced by a sense of security and mutual trust."

Not only can countries with different social systems coexist peacefully, but also countries with different levels of development, large and small countries, strong and weak countries can coexist peacefully. Peaceful coexistence can and should be guaranteed on the basis of strict respect for each other's sovereignty.

In the joint statement of Zhou Enlai and Nehru, the importance of resolving the political issue of Indochina was emphasized. The two prime ministers, after pointing out some progress made at the Geneva Conference, expressed their sincere hope that these efforts will be successful in the near future and achieve a political settlement of various issues in the region. The two prime ministers also hoped that the principles listed in the joint statement to guide relations between the two countries could also be applied to the settlement of the Indochina issue, "The political settlement in Indochina (emphasis added by the "Pravda" editor) should aim at creating free, democratic, unified and independent countries. These countries should not be used for the purpose of aggression, nor should they be subjected to foreign interference."

In view of the following circumstances, this authoritative statement is of greater significance, namely, those groups that are interested in maintaining international tensions are trying their best to influence the progress of the Geneva negotiations in order to only reach an agreement to cease hostilities, while indefinitely delaying a political settlement.

There is no need to prove that only a political settlement of the Indochina issue placed before the Geneva Conference can guarantee true peace in this region of Asia. The Soviet delegation has consistently pointed out the importance of discussing the political issues of Indochina, because without reaching corresponding agreements on the major political issues, the establishment of solid and reliable peace cannot be guaranteed.

If all participants in the negotiations are willing, not only in words but also in action, to restore lasting peace in Indochina, thereby easing international tensions and creating conditions for resolving other issues, then it is necessary not only to resolve the military issues of Indochina, but also to resolve the political issues. Otherwise, the Indochina issue cannot be resolved.

In this regard, one cannot fail to pay attention to some facts that prove that certain countries not only do not care about a peaceful settlement of the Indochina issue, but on the contrary, have not abandoned their plans to expand the war. The separate meetings held by representatives of the U.S. and British governments in Washington while the Geneva negotiations were in full swing cannot be interpreted in any other way. The U.S. diplomatic authorities are repeatedly trying to ensure the establishment of a Southeast Asian aggressive bloc. At the same time, efforts are being made to force France to take a more "tough" stance in Geneva, thereby hindering the settlement of the Indochina issue.

In this way, the U.S. diplomatic authorities continue to pursue their policy of aggravating international tensions in Asia and the world at the Washington Conference. This action is in sharp contrast to the efforts made in Delhi to consolidate peace in Asia and ease international tensions. Everyone can clearly see the different purposes of the two meetings held in Delhi and Washington, and public opinion will draw correct conclusions from this.

Many organ newspapers, especially newspapers in Southeast Asian countries, are condemning the conspiracies of the United States and Britain to resolve Asian issues without the participation of Asian countries. For example, the Indonesian "Newspaper" wrote on June 29: "The era of resolving Asian issues without the participation of the people of Asian countries is gone forever. Asian countries demand peace, prosperity and progress in culture and other fields."

The talks between Zhou Enlai and Nehru in Delhi were held for the sake of peace. Precisely for this reason, public opinion in Asia and the world welcomes the results of this meeting. Public opinion in all countries believes that this meeting will promote the cause of world peace.

    为了亚洲和世界的和平
    ——苏联“真理报”七月一日社论
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府政务院总理兼外交部部长周恩来和印度总理兼外交部部长贾瓦哈拉尔·尼赫鲁举行的会谈前几天已经结束了。亚洲两个最大的国家的政治家在印度首都德里会谈，讨论了许多对中国和印度共同有关的问题。两国总理对于中国和印度之间的友谊，表示信心，这一友谊将有助于世界的和平事业，并有助于他们本国与亚洲其他国家的和平发展。这些会谈的目的是为了有助于对亚洲问题获致更大的了解，并为了推进和平的和合作的努力，与世界其他国家相配合，来解决这些问题和类似的问题。两国总理同意，中印两国应维持密切的接触，以便两国继续保持充分的了解。
    “人民日报”就周恩来访问印度发表社论说，这次访问对于促进中印两国的友好关系和巩固亚洲及世界的和平有着重大的意义。
    印度的报纸也表示了类似的意见。“印度斯坦时报”在题为“亚洲的和平”的社论中写道：周恩来和尼赫鲁的会谈“对于亚洲和全世界都有着巨大的意义，因为这次会谈是一个争取亚洲和平与团结的更加强大的运动的起点……”。
    周恩来和尼赫鲁在他们的会谈中，对印度支那问题给予了相当的注意。这是十分自然的。在日内瓦会议上现在正在讨论印度支那问题。由于苏联、中华人民共和国和越南民主共和国代表在日内瓦的努力，才指出了一条导致停战与和平解决印度支那问题的道路。但是这条道路不合美国统治集团的心意，他们热衷于保持和加深国际紧张局势。目前，他们正背着亚洲一些主要国家继续拼凑侵略集团，以便镇压东南亚的民族解放运动，特别是实现对印度支那进行公开的武装干涉。因而，在这种情况下，中国和印度两国总理的会谈就具有更大的意义，因为会谈的目的是要尽一切可能的办法与努力来和平解决一切尚未解决的问题。
    在日内瓦会议上，第一次听到了亚洲人民真正代表的声音。中华人民共和国第一次参加了广泛的国际会议，中华人民共和国已走上了社会主义道路，成为一个强国，甚至那些以无理的阻挠政策阻挠中华人民共和国在联合国取得合法地位的敌对国家也不能不顾及它了。不言而喻，中华人民共和国参加讨论亚洲的迫切的问题，这是十分自然而必要的。终于在日内瓦会议上中华人民共和国取得了五大国之一的地位。广大的公众都把这件事看成是以苏联为首的整个民主阵营在不断为恢复伟大的中国的合法权利的斗争中的一个极重要的胜利。
    中华人民共和国代表团和苏联、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、越南民主共和国的代表团一起，坚决地主张在亚洲各国的民族独立、自由和民主的基础上和平解决亚洲问题。在这方面，中华人民共和国代表团所提出的而为苏联代表团所支持的建议就具有很大的意义，这一建议就是要亚洲国家彼此磋商，以求通过互相承担适当的义务的办法来共同努力维护亚洲和平和安全。周恩来在印度首都新德里举行的记者招待会上再次表示，“亚洲主要国家的适当的负责人员彼此之间有时会晤进行协商是适宜的”。
    在所发表的声明中说道，印中会谈的主要目的是对彼此的观点获得更清楚的了解，以便彼此合作并与其他国家合作以协助维护和平。这次会谈表明，不管社会制度是否相同，希望和平的国家间是能够进行成功的合作的，只要双方都关心这一合作并怀有诚意。
    德里会谈的参加者规定了指导两国关系的一些原则。这些原则就是下列五点：互相尊重领土主权；互不侵犯；互不干涉内政；平等互利；和平共处。毫无疑问，如果这些极重要的原则为亚洲各国及其他各国所采纳，就可减少战争的危险，促进国际紧张局势的缓和，和增进各国合作的可能性。
    这些原则在其他亚洲国家也得到了完全的支持。周恩来总理和缅甸联邦总理吴努在他们的联合声明中，在提到中国和印度所协议的指导两国之间关系的各项原则时指出：“这些原则也应该是指导中国和缅甸之间关系的原则。如果这些原则能为一切国家所遵守，则社会制度不同的国家的和平共处都有了保证，而侵略和干涉内政的威胁和对于侵略和干涉内政的恐惧就将为安全感和互信所代替。”
    不只是社会制度不同的各国可以和平共处，而且发达的程度还不相同的各国、大国和小国、强国和弱国也都是可以和平共处的。和平共处能够而且应该在严格尊重对方主权的基础上得到保证。
    在周恩来和尼赫鲁的联合声明中，着重指出了解决印度支那政治问题的重要性。两国总理在指出日内瓦会议所获得的一些进展后表示热诚地希望这些努力在最近的将来将能成功，并获致这个地区各项问题的政治解决。两国总理并希望，联合声明中列举的指导两国关系的原则也能适用于解决印度支那问题，“在印度支那的政治解决（着重点是我们加的——‘真理报’编者）应以创造自由、民主、统一和独立的各个国家为目的。这些国家不应被利用于侵略的目的，也不应受外来的干涉。”
    鉴于下列情况，这个有权威的声明就具有更大的意义，即对维持国际紧张局势感到兴趣的那些集团千方百计地力图影响日内瓦谈判的进程，以便只限于达成停止敌对行动的协定，而把政治的解决无限期地拖延下去。
    无须再证明，只有摆在日内瓦会议面前的印度支那问题的政治解决才能保证亚洲这一地区的真正和平。苏联代表团始终如一地指出讨论印度支那政治问题的重要性，因为在主要的政治问题上不取得相应的协议，建立巩固的和可靠的和平是不可能得到保证的。
    如果谈判的所有参加者不是在口头上，而是在行动上愿意恢复印度支那的稳固和平，从而缓和国际紧张局势并为解决其他问题创造条件的话，那末就不仅需要解决印度支那的军事问题，而且需要解决政治问题。否则，印度支那问题是不可能获致解决的。
    在这方面，不能不注意一些事实，这些事实证明某些国家不仅不关心印度支那问题的和平解决，而且相反，仍然没有放弃扩大战争的计划。美英两国政府代表正当日内瓦谈判紧张进行的时候在华盛顿举行的单独会议，不能作任何其他的解释。美国外交当局正在一次又一次地企图保证建立东南亚侵略集团。同时正在竭力强迫法国在日内瓦采取更加
  “强硬”的立场，从而阻挠印度支那问题的解决。
    美国外交当局就是这样在华盛顿会议上继续奉行它的加剧亚洲和世界的国际紧张局势的政策，这种作为与在德里为巩固亚洲和平及缓和国际紧张局势而作的努力恰成一尖锐对照。每一个人都能看清楚在德里和华盛顿举行的两种会谈的目的的不同，舆论将由此得出正确的结论。
    许多机关报纸，首先是东南亚各国的报纸都在谴责美国和英国企图不要亚洲国家参加就解决亚洲问题的阴谋。例如，印度尼西亚“新报”六月二十九日写道：“没有亚洲各国人民参加解决亚洲问题的时代已经一去不返了。亚洲国家要求和平、繁荣和在文化及其他各方面的进步。”
    周恩来和尼赫鲁在德里的会谈是为了和平而举行的。正因为如此，亚洲和世界各国的舆论都对这次会谈的结果表示欢迎。各国的舆论相信，这次会谈将促进世界和平事业。
