    People's Democratic Countries Develop Foreign Trade
    Poland
    Warsaw, Polish Press Agency: The Polish Council of Ministers held a meeting on the 8th to discuss various issues related to the further development of foreign trade. After hearing and discussing the report by Foreign Trade Minister Dąbrowski, the meeting adopted a resolution to improve the production of export goods and streamline the work of foreign trade organizations.
    The report and discussions at the meeting indicated that Poland's foreign trade volume in 1953 had increased to 2.7 times the pre-war average per capita. Thanks to the comprehensive assistance of the Soviet Union and the expansion of trade ties with socialist countries, Poland's national economy has obtained the necessary raw materials, machinery, industrial equipment, and agricultural products in the past decade. Despite certain capitalist countries implementing trade discrimination and creating various trade restrictions under pressure from the United States, Poland has established trade ties with many Western countries. Poland now trades with more than seventy countries.
    The resolution of the Council of Ministers pointed out that in order to fully accomplish the plan set by the Second Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party to further develop the national economy and improve the people's living standards, it is necessary to greatly increase the import of raw materials, manufactured goods, and machinery and industrial equipment needed for light industry and the food industry, while further increasing the imports needed for heavy industry.
    Czechoslovakia
    Moscow, TASS: "Izvestia" recently published an interview with the Minister of Foreign Trade of the Czechoslovak Republic, Mr. Dvořák. He talked about the development of Czechoslovakia's foreign trade relations, especially some of the salient features of trade with the Soviet Union and the democratic camp countries, as well as with capitalist countries this year.
    Dvořák pointed out that Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union have traditional economic relations. These relations are based on the principles of mutual assistance, representing a new and advanced form of international economic relations. These principles characterize Czechoslovakia's trade relations with the Soviet Union in 1954. As in previous years, the Soviet Union will supply Czechoslovakia with large quantities of food and raw materials for heavy and light industries, as well as important machinery and equipment. This year, the trade volume between Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union has greatly increased. This new feature of economic relations, aimed at achieving common economic prosperity, is also reflected in the technical cooperation and exchange of production experience between the two countries.
    Czechoslovakia's economic relations with other countries in the democratic camp will continue to expand and strengthen. It has signed long-term trade agreements with most of these countries. Compared to 1947 and 1948, its trade volume with some countries in the democratic camp has more than doubled, while its trade volume with others has increased tenfold.
    Dvořák said that in the first few months of this year, the characteristic of trade relations with capitalist countries is that the discriminatory policies implemented by some capitalist countries, under the orders of the American rulers, against Czechoslovakia and other countries in the democratic camp have been relaxed to a certain extent. In the first three months of this year, Czechoslovakia's trade volume with capitalist countries and underdeveloped countries increased by 22% and 47.1% respectively compared to the same period last year. It maintains trade relations with almost all countries in the capitalist world. So far, it has concluded bilateral trade agreements with twenty-four capitalist countries. This year, it also plans to conclude trade agreements with other countries and expand trade volume. To strengthen commercial relations, it is prepared to change one-year trade agreements into long-term trade agreements, and it is also prepared to conclude trilateral and multilateral trade agreements.
    Dvořák finally emphasized that the continued implementation of discriminatory and embargo policies by some Western countries has hindered the development of trade relations between Czechoslovakia and Western countries. However, the experience of recent years has proved that such policies cannot achieve any results. The considerable progress made by the Czechoslovak people due to the completion of the Five-Year Plan can prove this point.
    Romania
    The increasing proportion and variety of industrial product exports in Romania's foreign trade mark the tremendous development of socialist industry.
    In pre-war 1938, industrial products accounted for less than 1.8% of total exports in Romania, but by 1953, in addition to exporting large quantities of petroleum products and wood products, other industrial products accounted for 17.8% of exports. The products of one of Romania's major industrial sectors—the petroleum industry—occupy an important position in exported industrial products. Romania has now reversed the backward state of mainly exporting heavy oil before liberation, and can export large quantities of gasoline, motor gasoline, various lubricating oils, and paraffin wax. In terms of machinery manufacturing production, before the war, Romania relied on imports for 99% of its machinery and equipment, but in recent years, Romania has been able to export a wide variety of machines, including: machine tools, high-speed cutting lathes, steam turbines, petroleum industry equipment, crawler tractors, cultivators, electric motors, and automatic looms. These exported machines and equipment are very popular in foreign markets and have been sold to countries along the Indian Ocean, the Near East, and Latin America. In countries such as India, Iran, Egypt, and Argentina, Romanian-produced machines, tractors, electric motors, and railway vehicles enjoy a good reputation. In addition, Romania's exports of chemical industry and building materials industry products have also increased year by year.
    In order to ensure the needs of domestic socialist construction and increase exports, this year Romania's industrial sectors will further expand production. For example, in the machinery manufacturing industry, the production of 100 kW steam turbines will increase to approximately 6.7 times that of 1953, oil industry drilling rigs will increase to 4.45 times, cultivators will increase to 2.58 times, and internal combustion engines will increase to twice.

    人民民主国家发展对外贸易
    波兰
    据波兰通讯社华沙讯：波兰部长会议在八日举行了会议，讨论进一步发展对外贸易的各项问题。会议在听取并讨论了对外贸易部部长董布罗夫斯基的报告后，通过了改进出口货的生产和整顿对外贸易机构的工作的决议。
    会议的报告和讨论表明，一九五三年波兰的对外贸易额按人口平均计算已增为战前的二点七倍。由于苏联的全面帮助以及同社会主义阵营各国的贸易联系的扩大，波兰国民经济在过去十年中得到了必要的原料、机器、工业装备和农产品。尽管某些资本主义国家在美国的压力下实行贸易歧视和制造各种贸易方面的限制，波兰仍然和许多西方国家建立了贸易联系。现在波兰在和七十多个国家进行着贸易。
    部长会议的决议指出，为了全部完成波兰统一工人党第二次代表大会所确定的进一步发展国民经济和提高人民生活水平的计划，必须在进一步增加重工业所需的进口的同时，大大增加原料、制成品、以及轻工业、食品工业所需的机器和工业装备的进口。
    捷克斯洛伐克
    据塔斯社莫斯科讯：“消息报”最近刊载了捷克斯洛伐克共和国对外贸易部部长德沃夏克对记者的谈话。他谈到了捷克斯洛伐克的对外贸易关系的发展，特别是今年同苏联和民主阵营各国以及同资本主义国家贸易中的一些明显特征。
    德沃夏克指出：捷克斯洛伐克和苏联有传统的经济关系。这种关系是以互助的原则为基础的、新的、高级形式的国际经济关系。这些原则就是捷克斯洛伐克在一九五四年和苏联的贸易关系的特征。像往年一样，苏联将供给捷克斯洛伐克以大量的食品和重、轻工业用的原料，以及重要的机器和设备。今年捷克斯洛伐克同苏联的贸易量已大大增加。这种目的在于求得共同经济高涨的经济关系的新特征，也表现在捷苏两国间的技术合作以及生产经验的交流方面。
    捷克斯洛伐克和民主阵营其他国家的经济关系将继续扩大和加强。它已和这些国家中的大部分国家签订了长期贸易协定。与一九四七年和一九四八年相较，它和某些民主阵营的国家间的换货量已增加了一倍以上，而和另一些国家间的换货量增加了十倍。
    德沃夏克说，在今年头几个月中，和资本主义国家间贸易关系的特征是：某些资本主义国家在美国统治者的命令下对捷克斯洛伐克及民主阵营其他国家所实行的歧视政策，已有一定程度的放松。捷克斯洛伐克在今年头三个月中，和资本主义国家和落后国家间的贸易量比去年同时期分别增加了百分之二十二和百分之四十七点一。它差不多已和资本主义世界的所有国家保持着贸易关系。到现在为止，它和二十四个资本主义国家缔结了双边的贸易协定。今年它还打算同其他国家缔结贸易协定和扩大贸易额。为了加强商业关系，它准备把一年为期的贸易协定改为长期的贸易协定，它也准备缔结三边的和多边的贸易协定。
    德沃夏克最后强调说，某些西方国家到现在为止仍然要实行歧视和禁运政策，这就阻碍了捷克斯洛伐克和西方国家间贸易关系的发展。但是，最近几年来的经验证明，这种政策是不能够得到任何效果的。捷克斯洛伐克人民由于完成了五年计划而取得的相当大的进步就可以证明这一点。
    罗马尼亚
    罗马尼亚对外贸易中工业品输出的比重和种类不断增加，标志了社会主义工业的巨大发展。
    在战前一九三八年，罗马尼亚工业品在全部出口中所占的比重还不到百分之一点八，但到一九五三年，除输出大量的石油产品和木制品外，其他工业品在出口中所占比重就增加到百分之十七点八。罗马尼亚的大工业部门之一——石油工业的产品在输出的工业品中占着重要位置。罗马尼亚现在已扭转了解放前主要输出重油的落后状态，而能输出大量的石油精、摩托用汽油、各种滑润油和石蜡等。在机器制造生产品方面，战前罗马尼亚国内百分之九十九的机器和设备依赖进口，但近几年来，罗马尼亚已能输出种类繁多的机器，其中包括：工作母机、高速切削车床、蒸汽透平、石油工业设备、履带式拖拉机、中耕机、电动机和自动织布机等。这些出口的机器和设备在国外市场上很受欢迎，它们已行销到印度洋沿岸、近东和拉丁美洲国家。在印度、伊朗、埃及、阿根廷等国，罗马尼亚出产的机器、拖拉机、电动机、铁路车辆等享有很好的声誉。此外，罗马尼亚输出的化学工业和建筑材料工业的产品也逐年增加了。
    为了保证国内社会主义建设的需要和增加出口，今年罗马尼亚各工业部门将进一步扩大生产。例如在机器制造工业中，一百瓩的蒸汽透平的生产将约增为一九五三年的六点七倍，石油工业用钻机将增为四点四五倍，中耕机将增为二点五八倍，内燃机将增为二倍。　（新华社）
