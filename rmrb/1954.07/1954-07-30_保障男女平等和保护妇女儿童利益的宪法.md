The draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China effectively guarantees equality between men and women and the rights of women. The draft Constitution clearly stipulates: "Women have equal rights with men to vote and stand for election." "Women of the People's Republic of China enjoy equal rights with men in all aspects of political, economic, cultural, social and family life," "Marriage, family, mothers and children are protected by the state." These provisions in the draft Constitution show that our country guarantees equality between men and women and the rights of women in all aspects, and constantly creates various necessary conditions for consolidating and developing the rights of women.

In the past, our Party launched and organized a large number of women to participate in the long-term revolutionary struggle, and formulated laws to protect equality between men and women when the revolution had only achieved victory in some local areas, so that women had equal rights with men in all aspects of land distribution and inheritance of property, participation in social and political activities, etc., and also had equal freedom and democratic rights with men on the issue of marriage. This clear legal provision has effectively encouraged women's consciousness and enthusiasm to participate in the revolutionary struggle, various social and political activities, and social production labor; this consciousness and enthusiasm in turn overcame people's contempt and disdain for women, and various incorrect views, promoted the growth of new social customs and social public opinion, and promoted the development of the cause of women's liberation.

After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the rights of women stipulated by the laws of the past liberated areas were legislatively confirmed by the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and became laws that all state organs and the people throughout the country must abide by. Article 6 of the Common Program stipulates the principle that "the People's Republic of China abolishes the feudal system that shackles women. Women have equal rights with men in all aspects of political, economic, cultural, educational and social life. Freedom of marriage between men and women is implemented," and this principle is specifically embodied in many articles stipulated in the Land Reform Law, the Marriage Law, the Election Law, the Labor Insurance Regulations, and other laws and regulations. These provisions further encouraged women across the country to actively participate in the state's management work and social production activities. After several years of practice, the provisions of the Common Program concerning women's rights have gradually become a reality.

The political, social and economic status of women in our country is gradually improving with the advancement of our country's socialist construction. The vast number of women participate in political life and social activities equally with men. From the central to local governments, women are jointly managing state affairs with men. In the recent grass-roots elections, the average number of female voters participating in the election accounted for 84.01 percent of the total number of female voters, and the average number of elected female representatives accounted for 17.31 percent of the total number of male and female representatives. The number of female employees in factories, enterprises, schools and state organs has greatly increased; equal pay for equal work and labor insurance have been implemented. The proportion of rural women participating in agricultural labor has reached 60 to 80 percent. In some advanced agricultural production cooperatives, the labor days of female members account for 30 to 40 percent of the total labor days of the whole cooperative. The proportion of female students in schools at all levels has also increased year by year. Among the more than 2.3 million workers and more than 27 million farmers participating in spare-time learning across the country, women account for more than 40 percent. The publicity and implementation of the Marriage Law has improved the family status of women and promoted the development of a new type of family relationship characterized by equality between men and women, democratic unity, joint labor, mutual assistance and mutual love. In recent years, the country's active development of maternal and child health and child care has provided a strong guarantee and great encouragement for women to participate in production and political and cultural activities.

All of this shows that women in New China have basically achieved equal status with men in all aspects of political, economic, cultural, social and family life; the rights of women in our country have been newly developed and expanded with the new political and economic victories since the founding of the People's Republic of China and the efforts of women to participate in the construction of the motherland. This new development and expansion has now been affirmed by the draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China.

In our country, equality between men and women can be realized, and the rights of women can be protected, because our country is a people's democratic country that is striving to build a socialist society. In any country ruled by the exploiting classes, the masses of women are always in a position of being without rights and being enslaved. Capitalist society nominally recognizes equality between men and women, but does not provide any practical guarantee for the equal rights of the masses of women in social and political life. Only the socialist system can guarantee the elimination of all the shackles imposed on women by the old society, and guarantee that women will increasingly expand the possibility of participating in social labor and participating in political and cultural activities. The preamble to the draft Constitution states: "The people's democratic system of the People's Republic of China, that is, the New Democracy system, guarantees that our country can eliminate exploitation and poverty through peaceful means and build a prosperous and happy socialist society." This shows that the people's democratic system in our country has opened up a broad road for the real and complete liberation of women. Therefore, not only are the above-mentioned articles directly related to women's rights in the draft Constitution, but all the articles are guarantees for equality between men and women and the rights of women.

The provisions on equality between men and women and the protection of women and children in the draft Constitution, on the one hand, reflect the facts that already exist, and on the other hand, these provisions are weapons we use to fight against wrong views on women's issues. The ideas of belittling and despising women left over from the old society cannot be easily eliminated. The facts of the past few years have proved that: feudal residual ideas and bad habits, and the habitual forces arising therefrom, are still quite stubbornly hindering the smooth realization of equality between men and women; at the same time, starting from the capitalist individualistic point of view, disregarding the interests of spouses and children, disregarding the interests of society and the collective, and playing with the opposite sex in marriage and family issues, etc., also cause great harm to families, mothers and children. These views and behaviors are completely wrong and are incompatible with the spirit of people's democracy and socialism.

The provisions on the rights of women and children in the draft Constitution, like all other provisions in it, are sacred and inviolable, and everyone, regardless of gender, has the responsibility to abide by them. We cannot simply regard marital relations, family relations, husband-wife relations, and parent-child relations as private relations, thinking that we can do whatever we want without any correct views and reasonable principles. The state, society, family and individuals are closely related, and the actions of individuals in all aspects should be based on a unified socialist new morality and new ideological foundation, and should not separate so-called "public life" and "private life," and should not have principles that run counter to each other in these two aspects. It should be pointed out that there are such people: they behave one way at work and in social activities, like a very good person; and they behave another way in the family, in their treatment of their spouses, and in their treatment of their children, a very bad person. The good aspects of such people are not completely true, and their thoughts are not pure. Their bad performance in private life will inevitably affect their work and social activities, and bring damage to the entire social life. Therefore, creating an atmosphere in society that respects the rights of women and children in accordance with the spirit of the draft Constitution is an important aspect of cultivating and consolidating the new socialist morality.

Women across the country must recognize that the rights conferred on women by the draft Constitution still need to be guaranteed by women's due efforts to realize them. Women should also strive to overcome various inferiority complexes and dependent thoughts left over from the old society, bravely exercise the various rights guaranteed by the new social system, strive to improve their abilities, and fulfill their social responsibilities. Women across the country, whether at any work post or in the family, should respond to the call of the motherland and play an active role in completing the general task of the country's transition period. The era of enslaving women is gone forever; as long as women work actively, complete equality between men and women and women's liberation will be realized with the completion of socialist society.

### 保障男女平等和保护妇女儿童利益的宪法

    保障男女平等和保护妇女儿童利益的宪法
    中华人民共和国宪法草案，切实保障了男女平等和妇女的权利。宪法草案中明确地规定：“妇女有同男子平等的选举权和被选举权”。“中华人民共和国妇女在政治的、经济的、文化的、社会的和家庭的生活各方面享有同男子平等的权利”，“婚姻、家庭、母亲和儿童受国家的保护”。宪法草案中的这些规定表明我们的国家从各方面保障男女平等和妇女的权利，并为巩固和发展妇女的权利而不断地创造各种必要的条件。
    过去，我们党曾经发动和组织了大量的妇女参加长期的革命斗争，并且在革命还只在局部地区取得胜利的时候就制定了保障男女平等的法律，使妇女在分配土地和继承财产，参加社会政治活动等各方面都有和男子平等的权利，在婚姻问题上也有和男子同等的自由和民主权利。这种法律上的明确规定，曾经有效地鼓舞了妇女参加革命斗争、参加各种社会政治活动和社会生产劳动的自觉性和积极性；这种自觉性和积极性又反过来克服着人们对妇女的轻视、鄙视态度和各种不正确看法，促进了新的社会风气和社会舆论的成长，促进了妇女解放事业的发展。
    中华人民共和国成立以后，过去各解放区法律所规定的妇女的权利由中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领作了立法上的确认，成为全国一切国家机关和人民群众都须遵守的法律。共同纲领第六条规定了
  “中华人民共和国废除束缚妇女的封建制度。妇女在政治的、经济的、文化教育的、社会的生活各方面，均有与男子平等的权利。实行男女婚姻自由”的原则，这原则又在土地改革法、婚姻法、选举法、劳动保险条例，以及其他法律、条例所规定的许多条文中具体地体现出来。这些规定，更进一步地激励了全国妇女去积极地参加国家的管理工作和社会生产活动。经过几年来的实践，共同纲领中有关妇女权利的规定，已经逐步成为现实。
    我国妇女的政治地位、社会地位和经济地位，正随着我国社会主义建设的前进而逐步提高。广大妇女和男子平等地参加了政治生活和社会活动。从中央到地方各级政府机关，都有妇女在和男子共同管理着国家大事。在不久以前的基层选举中，参加选举的女选民平均占女选民总数百分之八十四点零一，当选的女代表平均占男女代表总数百分之十七点三一。在工厂、企业、学校和国家机关，女职工人数都大大增加；同工同酬和劳动保险已经实行。农村妇女参加了农业劳动的已达百分之六十到百分之八十。在一些先进的农业生产合作社中，妇女社员劳动日占全社劳动日总数百分之三十到四十。各级学校中女生所占比数也逐年增加，全国参加业余学习的二百三十多万职工和二千七百多万农民中，妇女占到百分之四十以上。婚姻法的宣传和贯彻，提高了妇女的家庭地位，并促进了男女平等，民主团结，共同劳动和互助互爱的新型家庭关系的发展。几年来国家积极发展妇婴卫生和儿童保育事业，更是给妇女参加生产和参加政治文化活动以有力的保证和巨大的鼓舞。
    这一切都说明了新中国的妇女在政治的、经济的、文化的、社会的和家庭的生活各方面已经基本上取得了与男子平等的地位；我国妇女的权利，随着中华人民共和国成立以来政治的、经济的新胜利和妇女们努力参加祖国建设事业而有了新的发展和扩充。这种新的发展和扩充，现在已由中华人民共和国宪法草案肯定下来了。
    在我们的国家里，男女平等能够实现，妇女权利能够得到保护，就因为我们的国家是正在为建成社会主义社会而奋斗的人民民主国家。在任何剥削阶级统治的国家里，妇女大众总是处于无权利的，被奴役的地位。资本主义社会名义上承认男女平等，但是对于妇女大众在社会政治生活上的平等权利没有任何实际的保障。只有社会主义制度才能保证扫除旧社会加于妇女的一切桎梏，并保证妇女日益扩大地获得参加社会劳动和参加政治与文化活动的可能。宪法草案序言中说：“中华人民共和国的人民民主制度，也就是新民主主义制度，保证我国能够通过和平的道路消灭剥削和贫困，建成繁荣幸福的社会主义社会。”这就表明，我国的人民民主制度是给妇女开辟了真正的彻底解放的广阔道路。所以在宪法草案中不仅是上举的一些直接有关妇女权利的条文，而且是全部条文都是对于男女平等和妇女权利的保障。
    宪法草案中关于男女平等和保护妇女儿童的规定一方面是反映了已经存在着的事实，另一方面这些规定又是我们用来和在妇女问题上的错误观点做斗争的武器。从旧社会遗留下来的轻视和卑视妇女的思想不是很容易地就能清除的。几年来的事实证明：封建残余思想和恶习及由此而产生的习惯势力，还相当顽强地在阻碍男女平等的顺利实现；同时从资本主义的个人主义观点出发，在婚姻和家庭问题上不顾配偶及子女的利益，不顾社会和集体的利益，玩弄异性等等思想和行为，也给家庭、母亲、儿童以很大的危害。这些观点和行为都是完全错误的，是和人民民主主义及社会主义的精神不能相容的。
    宪法草案中有关妇女儿童的权利的规定，也如其中一切其他规定一样，是神圣不可侵犯的，无论男女，人人都有遵守它的责任。不能把婚姻关系、家庭关系、夫妻关系、父母子女关系单纯看成为私人关系，以为可以随心所欲，不需要什么正确观点和合理原则。国家、社会、家庭与个人是密切关联的，个人在一切方面的行动都应当建立在统一的社会主义新道德和新的思想基础之上，而不应当把所谓“公生活”和“私生活”截然划开，不应当在这两方面有背道而驰的原则。应该指出，这样的人是有的：他们表现在工作上和表现在社会活动上是一种人，像是一个很好的人；而表现在家庭里，在对待自己的配偶，对待自己的子女上又是一种人，是一个很坏的人。这样的人的好的一面的表现并不是完全真实的，他们的思想是不纯洁的。他们在私生活中的坏的表现必然影响到他们的工作和社会活动，并且带给整个社会生活以损害。所以根据宪法草案的精神来造成社会中尊重妇女和儿童的权利的风气，正是培养和巩固社会主义的新道德的一个重要方面。
    全国妇女必须认识，宪法草案所赋予妇女的这些权利，还须依靠妇女尽其应有的努力来保证实现。妇女也应该力求克服从旧社会遗留下来的各种自卑观念和依赖思想，要勇敢地行使新的社会制度所给以保障的各种权利，努力提高自己的能力，善尽自己的社会职责。全国妇女不论是在任何工作岗位或在家庭中，都应该响应祖国号召，为完成国家过渡时期总任务而发挥积极作用。奴役妇女的时代是永远过去了；只要妇女们积极努力，彻底的男女平等和妇女解放就将随着社会主义社会的建成而实现。
