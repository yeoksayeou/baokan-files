Anshan Iron and Steel Works Steelmaking Plant Reduces Product Costs by 10 Billion Yuan in Five Months

[This newspaper report] The Anshan Iron and Steel Works Steelmaking Plant has reduced product costs by 10.3 billion yuan in five months.

In the fourth quarter of last year, all employees of the Steelmaking Plant implemented a fixed-material steelmaking system and initially implemented a workshop-level economic accounting system, saving the country more than 20 billion yuan in wealth. On this basis, the Steelmaking Plant formulated this year's cost plan. This year's product cost plan is 3.38% lower than the actual average cost for the entire last year. After studying the Party's general line for the transition period, all employees launched a socialist conservation competition, came up with many tricks, and further promoted the workshop-level economic accounting system, which reduced the cost of steel month by month. From January to May, product costs were reduced by 10.3 billion yuan compared to the plan.

The Steelmaking Plant has strived to reduce product costs in the following aspects: 1. Increase the effective operating rate of open-hearth furnaces, increase output, and take measures to improve quality. For example, the furnace refining rate in the first quarter was 3.8% lower than the actual average furnace refining rate last year. This created favorable conditions for increasing output. Due to the increase in output, fixed costs in costs have also decreased. This item accounts for one-third of the total cost reduction. 2. Under the principle of not affecting the output and quality of steel, try to use waste products and cheap raw materials instead of high-priced raw materials. From January to mid-May, employees put forward many rationalization proposals on reducing product costs, and the administration also took many measures. Calculated only by the implemented projects, it saved the country 860 million yuan in wealth. 3. Further implement the fixed-material steelmaking system, strengthen quota management, and reduce the steel material consumption quota month by month. The actual average quota for the first five months of this year was 3% lower than the actual average quota last year. This not only ensured the reduction of costs, but also saved the country a large amount of iron and steel raw materials for steelmaking. These raw materials can be used to smelt more than 10,000 tons of finished steel ingots. This steel can be used to manufacture more than 100,000 double-shared plows and more than 20,000 harvesters for agricultural production tools.

    鞍钢炼钢厂五个月降低产品成本一百亿元
    【本报讯】鞍钢炼钢厂五个月降低产品成本一百零三亿元。
    炼钢厂全体职工在去年第四季度，推行了定料炼钢制度，并初步推行了工段经济核算制，给国家节约二百多亿元的财富。在这一基础上，炼钢厂制订了今年的成本计划。今年的产品成本计划比去年全年实际平均成本降低了百分之三点三八。全体职工经过党在过渡时期的总路线的学习，展开了社会主义节约竞赛，想出了很多的窍门，进一步推行了工段经济核算制，使钢的成本逐月降低，一月到五月份较计划降低产品成本一百零三亿元。
    炼钢厂是从以下几个方面来争取降低产品成本的：一、提高平炉有效作业率，增加产量，并采取措施，提高质量。如第一季度炼炉率比去年实际平均炼炉率降低了百分之三点八。这样就给增加产量创造了有利条件。由于产量的提高，成本中的固定费用也降低了。这一项占成本总降低额的三分之一。二、在不影响钢的产量、质量的原则下，尽量利用废品和廉价的原材料代替高价的原材料。职工们在一月到五月中先后提出很多关于降低产品成本的合理化建议，同时行政上也采取了很多的措施。仅以实现的项目计算，就给国家节约八亿六千万元的财富。三、进一步贯彻定料炼钢制度，加强定额管理，使钢铁料消耗定额逐月降低，今年前五个月实际平均定额比去年实际平均定额降低百分之三。这不仅保证了成本的降低，而且给国家节省了大批炼钢用的钢铁原料。这些原料可以炼出一万多吨成品钢锭。这些钢能制造农业生产工具双铧犁十万多台，收割机两万多台。
