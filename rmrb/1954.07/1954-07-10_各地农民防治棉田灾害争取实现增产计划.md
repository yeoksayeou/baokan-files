Throughout the country, the cotton planting area has exceeded the planned target. At present, most cotton fields in various regions have been thinned, and some early-sown areas have already budded and flowered.

This year, insect pests in cotton fields have occurred earlier and are quite widespread. In June, most cotton-growing areas suffered from cotton aphid infestation. Northern cotton-growing areas and Northeast cotton-growing areas also have diseases such as anthracnose and cotton seedling blight. After the occurrence of diseases and insect pests, most areas have vigorously organized the masses to carry out prevention and control. For example, Shijiazhuang Prefecture in Hebei Province called on rural work to focus on insect control, and other work that should be stopped should be stopped, and work that should be slowed down should be slowed down; more than 230 county and district cadres in Jin County went to the countryside to control insects, and 64 medicine distribution teams were established. Supply and marketing cooperatives adopted the method of delivering medicine to homes to promote the sales of medicine and machinery. More than 3,000 mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives in the county carried out insect control competitions, driving 100,000 farmers to control insects. The treated cotton seedlings have grown three or four fruit branches. More than half of the villages in Handan, Feixiang, Yongnian and other counties have invested in the insect control campaign. Liaoxi Province convened a meeting of technical guidance stations in June to take prevention and control measures. Shandong Province leads farmers to adopt methods such as strengthening weeding, fertilization, removing diseased plants, and spraying Bordeaux mixture to rescue losses from diseases.

Cotton-growing areas in the Yangtze River basin and some cotton-growing areas in the north are vigorously carrying out waterlogging drainage and seedling protection work, striving to reduce the abandonment of cotton fields and ensure the realization of cotton production increase plans.

    各地农民防治棉田灾害争取实现增产计划
    【本报讯】全国棉花播种面积已超额完成了计划任务。目前各地大部棉田已经定苗，部分早播地区已现蕾开花。
    今年棉田虫害发生较早而且相当普遍。六月间大部棉区都受到棉蚜为害。北方棉区和东北棉区并有炭疽病、立枯病等棉苗病害。病虫害发生后，大部地区都大力组织群众进行防治。如河北省石家庄专区号召农村工作以治虫为中心，其他工作该停的停，该缓的缓；晋县县区干部二百三十多人下乡治虫，成立六十四个配药组，供销合作社采用送药上门办法推销药械，全县三千多互助组和农业生产合作社开展了治虫竞赛，带动十万农民治虫，治过的棉苗已长出三、四个果枝。邯郸、肥乡、永年等县半数以上的村已投入了治虫运动。辽西省于六月间召集技术指导站开会采取防治措施。山东省领导农民采用加强锄地、施肥、拔除病株、喷射波尔多液等法，抢救病害损失。
    长江流域一带棉区及北方部分棉区，正大力开展排渍保苗工作，尽力争取减少棉田废弃，保证实现棉花增产计划。
