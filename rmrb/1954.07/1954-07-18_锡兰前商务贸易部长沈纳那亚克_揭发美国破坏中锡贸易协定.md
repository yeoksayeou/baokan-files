Xinhua News Agency, Delhi, July 14th: According to a report in the "Hindustan Times," former Ceylonese Minister of Commerce and Trade, R.G. Senanayake, spoke at a mass rally in Colombo on the 13th, accusing the Ceylonese government of abandoning Ceylon's policy of non-participation in the "Cold War."

Senanayake emphasized: "Obviously, the intention to abolish the Sino-Ceylonese trade agreement and the imminent visit of the Ceylonese Prime Minister to the United States are closely linked. The Americans stubbornly want to force us to accept their way of thinking through intimidation. They have refused to buy our rubber and have tried every means to prevent us from obtaining the rice we need… Now, after they have failed to force us to accept their views, the United States suddenly remembers that we need its aid, so it invites the Ceylonese Prime Minister to the United States to discuss this issue with Eisenhower. However, the prerequisite for the Prime Minister's visit to the United States is the abolition of the trade agreement we signed with China."

    锡兰前商务贸易部长沈纳那亚克
    揭发美国破坏中锡贸易协定
    【新华社十五日讯】塔斯社德里十四日讯：据“印度斯坦时报”报道，锡兰前商务贸易部部长鲁·格·沈纳那亚克十三日在科伦坡一个群众大会上讲话，指责锡兰政府放弃锡兰不参加“冷战”的政策。
    沈纳那亚克着重指出：“显然，废除锡中贸易协定的打算和锡兰总理的即将访问美国这两件事有着密切的联系。美国人顽固地想以恫吓手段强迫我们接受他们的思想方法。他们曾拒绝买我们的橡胶，并千方百计地阻挠我们获得我们所必需的大米……现在，在他们无法强迫我们接受他们的观点之后，美国忽然想起我们需要它的援助，于是就邀请锡兰总理到美国去和艾森豪威尔讨论这一问题。但是，总理访美的必需条件是废除我们和中国签订的贸易协定。”
