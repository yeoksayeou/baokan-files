The faculty and students of the Central Conservatory of Music have begun their meaningful summer vacation. During the summer vacation, over a hundred students will hold a series of internship-based music concerts in Beijing, Tianjin, and other places. The students will present what they have learned in the classroom to the general public, solicit and listen to public opinion, and examine the teaching effectiveness.

Currently, a school-wide internship performance team has been organized, led by Yu Yixuan, head of the Vocal Music Department of the Central Conservatory of Music, with Huang Feili, head of the Orchestral Music Department, and Yi Kaiji, head of the Piano Department, serving as deputy leaders. Professor Huang Feili will also serve as the conductor of the choir and orchestra. Among the students participating in the internship performances is Luo Xinzhu, a soprano and winner of the 4th World Youth and Student Peace and Friendship Festival. The performance team includes a choir, an orchestra, a folk orchestra, as well as soloists, duets, instrumental soloists, and ensembles. After the examinations on July 4th, the students participating in the internship performances immediately began intensive rehearsals. They have prepared many wonderful musical programs for the general public, including Ma Sicong's "Motherland Chorus," Qinghai folk song "Half a Moon Climbing Up," and many new songs, such as Jiang Dingxian, head of the Composition Department of the Central Conservatory of Music’s “In the Newly Constructed City,” and student works such as Liao Shengjing, a fifth-year student in the Composition Department’s “Dear Beijing,” and Wu Yingju’s “Summer in Qingdao.” After a period of practice, the internship performance team will give public performances in Tianjin and Beijing in the second half of July. During this period, they will also hold music concerts for the farmers of the Red Star Collective Farm in the suburbs of Beijing and the agricultural workers of state-owned farms and tractor stations.
