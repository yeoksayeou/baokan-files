Xinhua News Agency, Baoding: Party committees at all levels in Hebei Province are vigorously implementing the Party's policy of mutual aid and cooperation. During the spring plowing and sowing season, the province dispatched more than 15,000 cadres to go deep into the countryside to help district and township cadres and rural grassroots organizations publicize and implement the Party's policy of mutual aid and cooperation. The county committees of the Chinese Communist Party in Hebei Province also held representative meetings of agricultural producers' cooperatives and mutual aid teams before and after sowing to review the leadership of local cooperative establishment and the development of mutual aid teams in accordance with the spirit of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee's resolution on developing agricultural producers' cooperatives and mutual cooperation.

    After further review and implementation of the Party's mutual aid and cooperation policy, more than 31,000 agricultural producers' cooperatives in Hebei Province have gradually been consolidated. After studying the Party's class line in rural work and understanding that only by relying on poor peasants and uniting with middle peasants can cooperatives be run well, the members of 783 agricultural producers' cooperatives in Zhao County, Wu Yi, and other places in Shijiazhuang Prefecture automatically modified unreasonable assessments of members' land, labor, livestock, and farm implements upon joining the cooperatives. Seventy-one old cooperatives in Qu Zhou County, Handan Prefecture, also automatically changed the profit distribution ratio of labor accounting for 40% and land accounting for 60% to a method of labor accounting for 50% and land accounting for 50%, or fixed output with proportional distribution, and extra output awarded to labor or complete awards to labor. In Tong County, Zhangjiakou and other prefectures and 22 counties, members of 3,141 agricultural producers' cooperatives, improved their class vigilance after studying the class line, and purged 839 landlord, rich peasant, and bad elements who had infiltrated the cooperatives. The Chinese Communist Party committees at all levels in Hebei Province also promoted the "contract work system" in one-third of the agricultural producers' cooperatives in the province to overcome the phenomenon of wasted labor. Through these measures, more than 30,000 agricultural producers' cooperatives in the province have launched a campaign to find ways to increase production and tap production potential. Many cooperatives used vacant land and field edges to plant crops, built more pigsties, and adopted methods such as close planting of cotton and millet, and artificial pollination of corn.

    In the further implementation of the mutual aid and cooperation policy, various localities actively rectified and developed mutual aid teams. During the spring plowing and sowing season alone, approximately 800,000 peasant households in the province participated in mutual aid teams. Among them, long-term mutual aid teams developed to account for about 30% to 50% of the total number of mutual aid teams. In Handan, Tangshan, and Zhangjiakou prefectures, more than 30,000 mutual aid teams are brewing to transition into cooperatives after the autumn harvest, and a few mutual aid teams have accumulated public property and are now actively creating conditions for the transition to cooperatives after the autumn harvest.

    After further studying the Party's mutual aid and cooperation policy, many agricultural producers' cooperatives and mutual aid teams in Hebei Province have improved the relationship between cooperatives, teams, and individual farmers. More than 2,300 mutual aid and cooperation networks have been jointly established by agricultural producers' cooperatives and mutual aid teams in more than 80 counties, including Ding County and Xuanhua, to help and learn from each other. Four hundred and eighty-two agricultural producers' cooperatives in Anxin, Mancheng, and other three counties in Baoding Prefecture selected 1,200 mutual aid teams as long-term training targets. Seventeen agricultural producers' cooperatives and 65 mutual aid teams in Xingtang County, Shijiazhuang Prefecture, also signed contracts for exchanging labor and livestock, and mutual assistance in technology. The thorough implementation of the mutual aid and cooperation policy has also helped some teams and cooperatives in the province correct the phenomenon of discriminating against individual farmers. Many agricultural producers' cooperatives and mutual aid teams in Handan, Baoding, and other places have included uniting and helping individual farmers in production as one of the contents of labor emulation. In the second district of Wu'an County alone, 65 cooperatives and 125 teams helped 930 individual farmers with production difficulties to seize the opportunity to plant 5,700 mu of cotton while the soil was moist.

    The result of implementing the mutual aid and cooperation policy has powerfully promoted agricultural production in Hebei Province this year. At the beginning of sowing, more than 30,000 agricultural producers' cooperatives and many advanced mutual aid teams in the province immediately formulated patriotic production increase plans and launched labor emulations with each other. In Zhengding and Gaocheng counties in Shijiazhuang Prefecture, 143 townships, 350 villages, 785 agricultural producers' cooperatives, and more than 3,600 mutual aid teams participated in the cotton planting competition. After launching a labor emulation in Maozhuang Township, Gaocheng County, 80 waterwheels in the township watered the land day and night. When livestock was insufficient, people pushed the waterwheels to water the land. Under the dry weather, the township overfulfilled the sowing task of more than 5,000 mu of cotton fields. Before and after the spring plowing and sowing, agricultural producers' cooperatives and mutual aid teams in the province actively led individual farmers to dig and repair more than 30,000 brick and earthen wells, open more than 400 canals, and purchase more than 40,000 waterwheels, turning 380,000 mu of dry land into paddy fields. This ensured the timely sowing of more than 17 million mu of cotton and more than 70 million mu of grain crops in the province. Farmers' production investment in Hebei Province this year has also exceeded that of previous years. According to extremely incomplete statistics, from January to May this year, agricultural producers' cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and individual farmers in Hebei Province added more than 50,000 pieces of large and small agricultural implements such as water pumps, carts, walking plows, and sprayers, and 87,000 head of draft animals. Through the farmers' processing and fertilization, the farmers in the province have won a bumper harvest of more than 30 million mu of wheat.

    河北省各级党委贯彻党的互助合作政策
    三万多农业生产合作社逐渐巩固
   【新华社保定讯】中共河北省各级党委大力贯彻党的互助合作政策。春耕播种期间，全省抽调一万五千多干部深入农村，帮助区、乡干部和农村基层组织宣传贯彻党的互助合作政策。中共河北省各县委员会，又在播种前后分别召开了农业生产合作社和互助组代表会议，依照中共中央发展农业生产合作社和互助合作决议的精神检查了当地建社与发展互助组的领导。
    经过进一步地检查和贯彻党的互助合作政策，河北省三万一千多个农业生产合作社已日渐巩固。石家庄专区赵县、武邑等地七百八十三个农业生产合作社的社员们，学习了党在农村工作当中的阶级路线，明白了只有依靠贫农联合中农，才能把社办好的道理后，自动修改了对社员入社土地、劳力、牲口、农具评议的不合理现象。邯郸专区曲周县七十一个老社，也自动将劳动力按四成土地按六成分红比例，改成劳动力按五成土地按五成分红办法，或固定产量按比例分配，超出产量后劳动力多分或完全归劳动力的分红办法。通县、张家口等专区二十二县内，有三千一百四十一个农业生产合作社的社员，学习阶级路线后提高了阶级警惕性，清洗了混进社的八百三十九户地主、富农和坏分子。中共河北省各级党委又在全省三分之一的农业生产合作社中推行了“包工制”，克服了窝工现象。经过这些措施，全省三万多个农业生产合作社掀起了寻找增产窍门、挖掘生产潜力的运动。许多社利用空地、地边种植作物，增修猪圈和采用棉花、谷子、玉米密植人工授粉等办法。
    在进一步贯彻互助合作政策当中，各地积极整顿和发展了互助组。仅在春耕播种期间，全省就有约八十万户左右的农民参加了互助组。其中长期互助组，发展到占互助组总数的百分之三十到百分之五十左右。邯郸、唐山和张家口专区，有三万多个互助组酝酿秋后转社，其中有少数互助组已积累起公共财产，现在正积极为秋后转社创造条件。
      河北省还有许多农业生产合作社和互助组进一步学习了党的互助合作政策后，改善了社、组、单干农民之间的关系。定县、宣化等八十多个县的农业生产合作社和互助组，曾联合建立了两千三百多处互助合作网，互相帮助，互相学习。保定专区安新、满城等三县的四百八十二个农业生产合作社，选择了一千二百个互助组，作为长期培养对象。石家庄专区行唐县也有十七个农业生产合作社和六十五个互助组签订了人畜换工、技术互助等合同。互助合作政策的深入贯彻，还帮助这个省部分组、社纠正了歧视单干农民的现象。邯郸、保定等地不少农业生产合作社和互助组，都把团结帮助单干农民生产作为劳动竞赛内容之一。仅武安县第二区的六十五个社和一百二十五个组，在抗旱播种当中，就帮助九百三十户生产困难的单干农民，趁墒抢种棉花五千七百亩。
    贯彻互助合作政策的结果，有力地推动了河北省今年的农业生产。播种一开始，全省三万多个农业生产合作社和许多的先进互助组，立即制订了爱国增产计划，并互相发起劳动竞赛。石家庄专区的正定、藁城两县，参加植棉竞赛的就有一百四十三个乡，三百五十个村，七百八十五个农业生产合作社和三千六百多个互助组。藁城县毛庄乡掀起劳动竞赛后，全乡八十辆水车日夜浇地，牲口不够用时就用人力推着浇，在干旱不雨的情况下，全乡超额完成了五千多亩棉田的播种任务。全省农业生产合作社和互助组在春耕播种前后积极带动单干农民，打修砖井、土井三万多眼，开渠四百多道，添购水车四万多辆，使三十八万亩旱地变成水田。从而保证了全省一千七百多万亩棉花，七千多万亩粮食作物的及时播种。河北省农民今年的生产投资也超过了往年。据极不完全的统计，今年一到五月份，河北省的农业生产合作社、互助组和单干农民添制抽水机、大车、步犁和喷雾器等大小农具有五万多件，耕畜八万七千头。经过农民的加工加肥，全省农民已赢得了三千多万亩小麦的丰收。
