Victory Through Struggle
    Zhang Tao

    In late June, Yongxin County, a model county in the old revolutionary base area and the Xianggan Soviet area during the Second Revolutionary Civil War, held a People's Representative Conference. Two hundred and twenty-three people's representatives gathered with immense joy to study and discuss the draft constitution.

      Smiles From the Heart

    When listening to reports or reading documents, every group and every representative appeared so focused and attentive, afraid of missing a single word or sentence.

    The discussion began. Representative Long Yousan said with deep emotion: "In the old society, the reactionaries concocted a set of 'puppet constitutions' specifically to kill and oppress us, the people. We had no rights at all. If we dared to talk about state affairs, we were labeled 'bandits' or 'bandit women,' and subjected to imprisonment, arrest, hanging, and beatings – those were our 'rights' back then. But now? Everything is decided by the people themselves, even the constitution is being discussed by the people. The draft constitution stipulates that all power belongs to the people. Our County Head, Comrade Wu Longkai, was democratically elected by everyone. In the old society, you couldn't even dream of such a thing."

    Representative Xiao Nian'e also said with emotion: "Before liberation, I struggled to survive alone with my young son. A hooligan in the village, relying on the power of the landlords and bureaucrats, forcibly seized my land. When I tried to file a complaint, that damned village head issued a notice saying: 'Rebellion Forbidden!' It was truly 'The government gate opens to the south, those without money need not come!' Now, we women are equal to men. I was elected as a people's representative. The constitution also specifically stipulates that women have equal rights in all aspects. I am truly happy!"

    People's Representative Li Yeli, who had been abroad twice and witnessed the happy lives of the Soviet people, said: "After visiting the Soviet Union, I always thought: It would be great if China could enter socialist society sooner, with machines doing the work, and electric lights and radios in our homes... The benefits of socialist society are truly endless. Now, the state is going to use the constitution to ensure the elimination of the exploitative system, establish a socialist society, and guarantee our happy lives. I am truly smiling from the heart!"

      The Fruits of the People's Struggle

    The people's representatives from the old revolutionary base area have an even deeper understanding of the value of today's announcement of the draft constitution. They realize that the draft constitution is the result of the Chinese people's heroic struggle. Take Liu Shaochi, for example. He served as a township chairman during the Second Revolutionary Civil War, leading the people in actively carrying out revolutionary struggles. During several encirclements and suppressions by the Kuomintang reactionaries, he resolutely sent his two sons to join the Red Army (both of whom later died gloriously) in order to protect the fruits of the struggle. After the Red Army marched north, the reactionaries robbed and burned his home, and subjected his family to beatings and hangings. His third son at home was forcibly conscripted. The landlord bureaucrats said maliciously: "We will cut off Liu Shaochi's roots!" Today, the revolution has been victorious, and he has become a people's representative. During the discussion, this nearly seventy-year-old man, radiant and full of energy, said: "The blood of the revolutionary martyrs was not shed in vain, my sons did not die in vain. The draft constitution is a flower cultivated by the blood of the martyrs."

    County Head Wu Longkai, who had experienced a long period of revolutionary struggle, said meaningfully: "It is truly not easy for the country to formulate a constitution today! It is entirely earned by the people's blood and sweat. Every word and every sentence in the draft constitution contains great significance. It reminds me of the heroic struggles of many revolutionary comrades. During Chiang Kai-shek's bandit 'encirclements and suppressions,' tens of thousands of young people from Yongxin County joined the Red Army and bravely went to the front lines, always fighting fearlessly. Many comrades died heroically. After the Red Army marched north, they transferred to the enemy's rear to persist in guerrilla warfare. Those who were arrested and captured were not afraid in the enemy's courts. Take Comrade He Zhongliang, for example. He led a company to persist in the struggle in the Xiaogang area. In order to deal with the enemy's 'suppression of the mountains,' it was difficult to move around during the day and they couldn't sleep at night. They could hardly get a meal every three or five days. When they were hungry, they would cut some wild grass to boil and eat, enduring sun and rain for more than a year. Later, Comrade He Zhongliang was unfortunately arrested. The enemy used the method of stepping on a lever to make him faint several times, and also pierced his palms with thick iron wire. The Kuomintang reactionaries also burned his house. But he never surrendered! I don't know how many comrades like this there were. Thinking of them, I feel even more responsible. I am determined to serve the people even better."

    Xiao Nian'e, after listening to the representatives' speeches, said excitedly: "I must write a letter to my son in the army and tell him to participate well in military training, strengthen national defense, and not allow imperialists and reactionaries to bully us!"

      Guarantee of Socialist Construction

    From reminiscing about the past, the people's representatives went on to look forward to a bright future. They unanimously believed that with a constitution, socialist construction could be guaranteed. The facts of Jiang Fengyuan, a provincial agricultural labor model, and her agricultural production cooperative illustrate the importance of carrying out the socialist transformation of agriculture through mutual aid and cooperation. This cooperative was formally established in the winter of 1953. In the past six months, it has already demonstrated its superiority. Due to the unified use of labor, spring plowing alone saved eighty-three workdays, and the spring plowing was completed seven days ahead of schedule. They also universally selected seeds, appropriately densely planted, and applied more fertilizer. Now the seedlings are growing very well. The masses all admired and said: "Good seedlings are the result of the cooperative!" After Jiang Fengyuan introduced these vivid facts, she said: "The draft constitution stipulates that the state will carry out the socialist transformation of the small-peasant economy and encourage farmers to organize cooperatives according to the principle of voluntariness. This is completely correct. When everyone clarifies their goals and works together, this great cause can be completed sooner." Li Yeli also told everyone about the production situation of their agricultural production cooperative last year: Last year, the cooperative increased production by more than 23 percent, while the best mutual aid group only increased production by 14 percent, and individual farmers only increased production by 6 to 8 percent. The income of the cooperative members increased. The most increase was for Li Boxian, who harvested 3,170 jin the year before last and 4,901 jin last year. Even Li Songyuan, who received the least, harvested three shi more than the year before last. The masses all said: Mutual aid is better than individual farming, and cooperatives are even stronger than mutual aid. This spring, their cooperative expanded by five more households.

    People's Representative Chen Chunmei used her own example of patiently persuading her father to join a mutual aid group to illustrate the correctness of the draft constitution's provision that the state should encourage farmers to voluntarily organize themselves. She said: "My father is a middle peasant, with cattle, farm tools, and labor all complete. He was afraid of suffering losses after joining the mutual aid group, so he stubbornly refused to join and wouldn't even let me do it. He said: 'If you want to do mutual aid, there are still two dan of grain upstairs, you take one dan and we'll separate the family.' After a long period of persuasion, especially the group members guided him to recall the past, and he saw with his own eyes that other mutual aid groups had more people and worked faster, and that reasonable scoring meant that middle peasants didn't suffer losses, my father finally joined. Doesn't this just prove that only through patient and arduous persuasion and demonstration can farmers be voluntarily organized!"

    The draft constitution stipulates that the state should realize socialist industrialization, and all the representatives expressed their heartfelt support. They talked about daily necessities, all the way to machines plowing the fields, and said: "The draft constitution stipulates that the People's Republic of China should take the working class as the leadership and the worker-peasant alliance as the foundation. This is very important, otherwise socialist construction cannot be guaranteed."

      Strive for Greater Glory

    "Carry forward the revolutionary tradition and strive for greater glory" – this is Chairman Mao's hope for the people of the old revolutionary base areas, and everyone keeps Chairman Mao's words firmly in mind. As People's Representative Jiang Fengyuan said: "We must never forget the pain once the wound is healed." Everyone said that they would use practical actions to support the draft constitution.

    People's Representative and Jiangxi Province's Special-Class Labor Model Li Yeli first proposed a guarantee: "The state encourages the enthusiasm and creativity of citizens in labor. I am a labor model, and I must give full play to my enthusiasm and creativity. The summer harvest is approaching, and we must lead the people of the whole township to rush to repair the two ponds that were washed down by the mountain floods, strengthen drought and flood prevention, and insect prevention work, ensure that the whole township accumulates one million jin of fertilizer, strive for a bumper harvest of early rice in the whole township, and complete the plan for patriotic production increase and the pre-sale of 70,000 jin of early rice. I will also unite the members of the agricultural production cooperative, resolutely run the agricultural cooperative well, set an example, and promote the masses of the whole township to take the road of mutual aid and cooperation."

    People's Representatives Jiang Fengyuan, Chen Huiji, Long Yousan, etc. (all female directors of agricultural production cooperatives) also said: "Comrade Li Yeli took the first step well last year, leading us to establish five cooperatives. This year, we need to take the second step even better in order to lead the whole county to establish more agricultural production cooperatives."

    Finally, the people's representatives unanimously believed that they should earnestly lead the people to study and discuss the draft constitution, and lead the people of the whole county to struggle for the establishment of 134 agricultural production cooperatives after the autumn harvest.

    斗争带来的胜利
    张涛
    六月下旬，革命老根据地、第二次国内革命战争时期湘赣苏区的模范县——永新县召开了人民代表大会会议。二百二十三名人民代表怀着无比喜悦的心情，集聚一堂学习和讨论宪法草案。
      心里笑开花
    听报告或阅读文件的时候，每一个小组，每一个代表，都显得那么专心、紧张，他们生怕漏掉一个字，漏听一句话。
    讨论开始了。代表龙友三沉痛地说：“在旧社会，反动派搞一套‘伪宪法’，专门杀害、压迫我们人民，我们根本没有什么权利，我们要谈谈国家大事，就给加上‘土匪’、‘土匪婆’的罪名，被关、被捉、被吊、被打，就是我们那时的权利。现在呢？事事由人民自己作主，连宪法还要人民讨论。宪法草案中规定一切权力属于人民。我们的县长吴隆开同志，就是大家民主选举出来的，要是在旧社会呀，莫想这样。”
    代表萧年娥也感慨地说：“解放前，我一个人带着小儿子痛苦地过活。村上有个流氓，仗着地主官僚的势，强占我的田，我要去告状，那鬼乡长却来张条子，说是：‘不准造反’。真是‘衙门八字开，有理无钱莫进来’！现在，我们妇女也和男子一样平等了，我被人民选做代表。宪法中又特别规定妇女在各方面有平等的权利，我心里真高兴！”
    曾经二次出国，亲眼看过苏联人民幸福生活的人民代表李页里说：“到苏联参观以后，我老是想：我们中国快点到社会主义社会才好，做活时用机器，家里用电灯、收音机，……，社会主义社会的好处真是一时间说也说不完。现在国家要用宪法规定，保证消灭剥削制度，建立社会主义社会，保证我们过幸福生活。我心里真是笑开了花！”
      人民斗争的成果
    革命老根据地的人民代表，都更深一层地懂得今天公布宪法草案的可贵，他们认识到：宪法草案是中国人民英勇斗争的成果。就拿刘少池来说，他在第二次国内革命战争时期当过乡主席，领导人民积极进行过革命斗争。在国民党反动派几次围剿中，为了保卫斗争果实，他毅然将两个儿子送去当红军（后都光荣牺牲）。红军北上后，反动派把他的家抢光、烧光，对他的家人又是打、又是吊，在家里的三儿子被强拉去当壮丁。地主官僚恶毒地说：“就是要绝你刘少池的根！”今天，革命胜利了，他又当了人民代表，讨论中，这位快七十岁的老人，容光焕发，精神奕奕地说：“革命先烈的血没有白流，我的儿子没有白死，宪法草案正是先烈们的鲜血培育起来的鲜花。”
    经过长期革命斗争的县长吴隆开，意味深长地说：“今天国家能制订宪法，真是不容易呀！这完全是人民用血汗换来的，宪法草案里每一个字、每一句话，都包含着重大的意义，它使我想起好多革命同志的英勇斗争。在蒋介石强盗‘围剿’时，我们永新县有成千上万的青年参加了红军，勇敢地走上前线，作战时总是奋不顾身，很多同志壮烈牺牲了；红军北上后，他们转移到敌后坚持游击斗争。被捕被俘的在敌人的法庭上，毫不畏惧。就拿贺忠良同志来说吧，他带着一连人，在晓冈一带坚持斗争。为了对付敌人的‘剿山’，白天很难出去走动，晚上又不能睡觉，三天五天难得吃到一顿饭，饿了就割些野草煮来吃，日晒雨淋，坚持了一年多。后来贺忠良同志不幸被捕，敌人用踩杠子的办法把他踩得几次昏过去，还用粗铁丝穿他的手掌；他家里的房子也被国民党反动派烧光了。但他决不投降！像这样的同志，真不知有多少，想起他们，我更觉得责任重大，我决心要更好地为人民服务。”
    萧年娥听了代表们的发言，激奋地说：“我一定要写信告诉我在部队里的儿子，好好参加练兵，增强国防力量，不能让帝国主义、反动派来欺侮我们！”
    社会主义建设的保证
    从回忆过去，人民代表们进而展望美好的将来。他们一致认为：有了宪法，就可以保障社会主义的建设。省农业劳动模范江凤元和她的农业生产合作社的事实，说明了通过互助合作进行农业社会主义改造的重要。这个合作社是在一九五三年冬天正式成立的。半年来，它已经显示了它的优越性，由于统一使用劳动力，光春耕就节省了八十三个工，而且全面提早七天完成了春耕，他们还普遍选了种，适当地密植，多下了肥料，现在禾苗长得很好。群众都羡慕地说：“好禾苗就是合作社的！”江凤元介绍这些生动的事实后说：“宪法草案上规定国家对小农经济实行社会主义改造，并鼓励农民根据自愿原则组织合作社，这是完全正确的。大家明确了目标，共同努力，才能早日完成这一伟大事业。”李页里也将她们农业生产合作社去年的生产情况告诉大家：去年社里增产了百分之二十三强，而最好的互助组只增产百分之十四，单干农民只增产百分之六到百分之八。社里的社员收入增加了，最多的是李伯先，前年收三千一百七十斤，去年收四千九百零一斤，李松元虽分得最少，也比前年多收了三石。群众都说：互助比单干好，合作社更比互助强。今年春上他们社又扩大了五户。
    人民代表陈春妹用自己耐心说服父亲参加互助组的例子，来说明宪法草案中规定国家要鼓励农民自愿组织起来的正确性，她说：“我父亲是个中农，耕牛、农具、劳动力，门门齐全，生怕参加互助组后吃亏，他硬不参加，还不准我去搞。他说：‘你要搞互助，楼上还有两担谷，你拿一担去，咱们分家。’经过很久的说服，特别是组员们引导他回忆过去，又用事实让他看见别的互助组人多做事快，合理评分，中农也没吃亏，我父亲终于参加了。这不正好说明，只有经过耐心、艰苦的说服工作和示范才能使农民自愿组织起来！”
    宪法草案中规定国家要实现社会主义工业化，全体代表都表示衷心拥护，他们从日用品谈起，一直谈到机器犁田，都说：“宪法草案规定中华人民共和国要以工人阶级为领导，工农联盟为基础，这很重要，否则就不能保障社会主义建设。”
    争取更大光荣
    “发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”，这是毛主席对革命老根据地人民的希望，大家都牢牢地记着毛主席的话。正如人民代表江凤元说的：“决不能好了疮疤忘了痛。”大家都说要用实际行动拥护宪法草案。
    人民代表、江西省省特等劳动模范李页里首先提出保证：“国家鼓励公民在劳动中的积极性和创造性，我是个劳动模范，我一定要好好发挥积极性和创造性。现在快要夏收了，我们一定要带动全乡人民抢修被山洪冲倒了的两口水塘，加强防旱防洪和防虫工作，保证全乡积肥一百万斤，争取全乡早稻丰收，完成爱国增产任务和预售早稻七万斤的计划。我还要团结农业生产合作社社员，坚决把农业社办好，做出样子，推动全乡群众走互助合作的道路。”
    人民代表江凤元、陈回姬、龙友三等（都是农业生产合作社女社长）也说：“去年李页里同志第一步走得好，带领我们也办了五个社。今年我们第二步要走得更好，才能带动全县办起更多农业生产合作社。”
    最后，人民代表们都一致认为：要认真地领导人民群众学习和讨论宪法草案，带领全县人民为在秋后建立一百三十四个农业生产合作社而奋斗。
