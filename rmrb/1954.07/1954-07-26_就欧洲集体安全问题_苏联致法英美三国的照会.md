Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 25th: The newspapers on the 25th published the Soviet government's notes to the governments of France, Britain, and the United States regarding European collective security.

On July 24th, Soviet Foreign Minister V.M. Molotov received Mr. Leroy, Charge d'Affaires ad interim of the French Embassy in the Soviet Union, Mr. W. Hayter, British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, and Mr. Wormsley, Charge d'Affaires ad interim of the US Embassy in the Soviet Union, and handed them the Soviet government's reply to the notes of the governments of France, Britain, and the United States on May 7, 1954.

The full text of the French government's note of May 7, 1954, and the Soviet government's reply of July 24, 1954, are as follows:

French Government Note of May 7, 1954

The French Embassy presents its compliments to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of The Union Of Soviet Republics and has the honor to inform the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union of the following:

I. The French government has consulted with the governments of the United States, the United Kingdom, and other relevant countries, particularly the member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, on those aspects of European security issues that the four foreign ministers had fully discussed in Berlin and that the Soviet government had again urged the French government to pay attention to in its note of March 31.

II. The French government has long hoped to achieve universal disarmament, including the prohibition of atomic weapons, weapons of mass destruction, and the establishment of controls on atomic energy. In the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission, the United Nations Commission for Conventional Armaments, and subsequently the United Nations Disarmament Commission, the French government has striven to promote the conclusion of international disarmament agreements, with a view to ending the arms race that has placed such a heavy burden on the people of all countries. Such an agreement can only be reached on the basis of acknowledging a plan for gradual and proportional disarmament under effective guarantees, which should eliminate any danger of aggression, regardless of where the aggression comes from. The French government is determined to strive for the successful conclusion of the discussions initiated on the initiative of President Eisenhower and the discussions on disarmament issues that will soon begin again in the United Nations. The French government hopes that the Soviet government will also make constructive contributions to the solution of these problems. In order to ensure the success of these discussions, it is first necessary to restore an atmosphere of security and trust. It is from this point of view that the French government has carefully re-examined the Soviet government's proposals for European security, which were initially put forward in Berlin and later reiterated in its note of March 31. In these proposals, the Soviet government does not intend to eliminate the real causes of tension in Europe. On the contrary, it proposes a new collective security treaty, which is clearly based on the neutralization of Germany and the maintenance of Germany's division, and preserves intact the unilateral political, economic, and military control exercised by the Soviet government in Eastern European countries. As a result, Europe would remain insecure and divided for a long time. These proposals, even after the amendment on allowing the United States to participate, cannot serve as a basis for genuine security.

IV. The establishment of an organization outside the United Nations, including the Soviet Union, the United States, and all European countries, would in no way strengthen the world security organization that already exists: it would not only be useless but also dangerous, as it would inevitably undermine the United Nations. Therefore, the French government cannot accept the Soviet proposal. Collective security would be best guaranteed if the Soviet government allowed the United Nations to perform the functions prescribed in the Charter.

V. The Soviet government also advocates expanding the Atlantic Treaty by allowing the Soviet Union to join it, in addition to the collective security treaty it proposes. It is needless to point out the absolutely unrealistic nature of this proposal. It is directly contrary to the principles on which the defense efforts and security of the Western countries, which are closely linked by mutual trust, are based. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which is not merely a military agreement, is based on the principles of freedom and respect for rights. The defensive means by which its member states are united guarantee the security of each of its member states, because since 1945 the Soviet Union's military advantage in Europe, and the expansion of the economic, political, and military systems that the Soviet Union has completely controlled to the West, have made each of these countries unable to obtain this security alone. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization is entirely defensive. The members of this organization can freely and fully exchange information. All decisions of this organization are taken by unanimous agreement. If the Soviet Union were to become a member of this organization, it could use its veto power on every decision of this organization. None of the members of this organization would allow their collective security system to be undermined.

VI. Destroying the defensive alliance of countries with the same ideas and attempting to replace it with new, illusory security organizations will never consolidate the security of Europe and the world. The French government continues to believe that only by solving each problem step by step can the sense of insecurity that envelops the world be eliminated. The French government believes that establishing new security organizations cannot solve problems once and for all, because such new security organizations merely mask the existence of serious difficulties and divisions.

VII. It is precisely for this reason that the Western countries proposed in Berlin a plan that could serve as a first step towards solving the German problem, but the Soviet government did not even agree to discuss this plan. The Western countries also put forward a number of proposals aimed at consolidating European security on the basis of existing agreements, but the Soviet government again refused to examine these proposals. The Western countries suggested accepting the Soviet terms on all disputed clauses in the Austrian Treaty, but the Soviet government not only refused to sign the treaty on its own terms, but also put forward new, unacceptable demands that completely distorted the nature of the treaty and transformed a treaty providing for freedom and independence into a treaty providing for the indefinite occupation by foreign troops.

VIII. The Soviet government repeated its criticisms of the plan for the European Defence Community in Berlin. The French government has already expressed its views on this point and cannot agree with the suggestion that this plan with limited effect is the cause of Europe's division or that this plan increases the risk of war. The division of Europe was caused by the Soviet government, and its refusal to study the issue of unifying Germany on the basis of free elections is one of the factors that perpetuate this division. In this situation, the Federal Republic of Germany cannot be left without defense, especially since East Germany possesses a large number of armed forces, as even the leaders of East Germany admit. The French government believes that the most reliable and effective way for all parties concerned to resolve the issue of Germany's participation in defense is to establish an alliance that, by its very nature, would prevent Germany from taking any unilateral armed action.

IX. The French government continues to believe that it is urgently necessary to improve relations between countries and to guarantee their common security. It believes that in order to make progress in eliminating the root causes of international tension, it would be best if the Soviet government could specifically demonstrate its sincerity in working with the governments of France, the United States, and the United Kingdom to:

A. Strive for the speedy resolution of the Austrian problem in order to grant Austria full sovereignty and independence;

B. Strive for a once-and-for-all and mutually acceptable solution to the German problem;

C. Conclude in the near future an agreement on universal, gradual, proportional, and supervised disarmament, which should provide for the prohibition of atomic weapons and other weapons of mass destruction, as well as the establishment of control over atomic energy by making corresponding guarantees.

D. Strive for the resolution of the most urgent problems of the Far East at the Geneva Conference;

E. Adopt a position in the United Nations that is in accordance with the principles of the Charter, so that the United Nations can fulfill its mission as an organization for collective security.

Soviet Government Note of July 24, 1954

The Soviet government considers it necessary to make the following statement regarding the French government's note of May 7:

It is clear from the French government's above-mentioned note that the French government does not agree with the Soviet government's views expressed in its note of March 31 on the issue of concluding an all-European treaty guaranteeing European collective security, and on the Soviet government's readiness to jointly study the issue of Soviet participation in the North Atlantic Treaty with the governments of the relevant countries. At the same time, the French government has not put forward any proposals aimed at guaranteeing the security of all European countries. If we proceed from the interests of consolidating peace, we cannot consider it right for the French government to adopt such an attitude towards such an important issue as guaranteeing European security.

It is clear from the above-mentioned note that the position adopted by the French government, which claims to be concerned about guaranteeing European security, cannot in fact meet this goal, because under the guise of guaranteeing European security, exclusive groups of countries are being organized that do not allow all other countries to participate. France's position on forming an "alliance of countries with the same ideas" in the manner of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the "European Defence Community" is, in short, this. It can be seen from this that the French government does not recognize the need to guarantee the security of all European countries—regardless of their social systems—but instead adopts a policy of establishing exclusive groups of countries that pursue policies that serve the narrow group interests of these countries and oppose countries with different social systems.

However, these facts prove that groups that have become military aggressive alliances cannot consolidate peace and international security. These groups, which are in opposition to other countries, inevitably lead to an arms race and a deterioration of international relations, thereby causing new wars. Therefore, the French government's pursuit of a policy of establishing exclusive military groups is contrary to the interests of the security of all European countries and is, in fact, opposed to guaranteeing the security of the whole of Europe. The establishment of such exclusive groups with an aggressive nature is contrary to the principles of the United Nations Organization, because this organization is established on the basis of uniting all countries—regardless of their social and political systems—and must rely on cooperation and collective efforts between countries to maintain peace and international security. It is precisely this kind of exclusive military group that undermines both the foundations of the United Nations and its international prestige.

The North Atlantic Treaty Organization is such a military group with an aggressive nature. The Soviet government has repeatedly pointed out that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is not defensive at all. This organization completely ignores the threat of German re-aggression, and its purpose is not to prevent this aggression, even though France and Britain are obliged to prevent German re-aggression in accordance with their treaties with each other and in accordance with the treaties they have concluded with the Soviet Union. This situation alone is sufficient to convincingly demonstrate that the purpose pursued by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is not to eliminate the most realistic threat in the current situation, which is the threat of the revival of German militarism and the resurgence of German aggression, which may bring new and greater disasters to the peoples of European countries. In this regard, people cannot but pay attention to the fact that among the major powers that made up the anti-Hitler alliance, only the Soviet Union was excluded from this organization. People cannot but regard this fact as a clear proof that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization has an aggressive nature towards the Soviet Union.

The French government's note of May 7 refuses to consider the possibility of the Soviet Union joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which fully confirms the aggressive nature of this organization.

The French note of May 7 explains the issue from the angle that it insists that: once the Soviet Union participates in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Soviet Union will use its right as a member of this organization to "use its veto power on every decision of this organization," thereby "undermining" this organization. However, the artificial and untenable nature of this argument is very obvious, because the Soviet Union has not demanded any special status different from that of other participants in this treaty.

The Soviet government must once again emphasize the particular danger posed by the new military group now being established under the guise of the "European Defence Community." The program and plans of this group will lead to the revival of German militarism, and the revival of German militarism threatens the security of the entire Europe, and especially the security of the countries bordering West Germany. The French government's note of May 7 insists that the "European Defence Community" is an organization that "by its very nature can prevent Germany from taking any unilateral armed action." This statement is groundless. It is a distortion of historical facts to think that it is now possible to impose certain restrictions on German militarism using the Paris and Bonn treaties. However, history proves that whenever militarists and revanchists have controlled the fate of Germany, Germany has inevitably taken the road of aggression, turning the agreements it has signed and the obligations it has undertaken regarding the security of other countries into waste paper.

Therefore, the implementation of the plan to establish the "European Defence Community" cannot but lead to a deepening of the threat of a new war in Europe, and the first victims of this threat will be the countries bordering West Germany. Only an international organization including all European countries, and not an exclusive military group—an organization of the "European Defence Community" type, can guarantee peace and security in Europe.

The Soviet Union's point of departure has always been and will continue to be to recognize the possibility of coexistence of countries with different social systems, and to recognize the necessity of international cooperation on the basis of the collective efforts of European countries concerned with guaranteeing international security and peace.

Therefore, the Soviet government, at the Berlin Foreign Ministers' Conference of the four countries of France, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, put forward the proposal on "Guaranteeing European Security" and submitted its draft "All-European Treaty on Guaranteeing European Collective Security" for discussion at the conference. The most important feature and benefit of the all-European treaty proposed by the Soviet Union is, first and foremost, the fact that all European countries, regardless of their social systems, can participate in this treaty. Both the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany can participate in this treaty, and after Germany is unified, a unified Germany can also participate in this treaty. The basic principle of the all-European treaty is that the contracting parties to the all-European treaty take collective action to deal with the threat of armed attack in Europe against one or more of the contracting parties. In the event of an attack on any contracting party, each contracting party may assist one or more countries that have been subjected to such an attack in every possible way, including the use of armed forces, in order to restore and maintain international peace and security in Europe. At the same time, the contracting parties shall not participate in any alliance or coalition, or conclude any such agreement, the purpose of which is inconsistent with the purpose of guaranteeing European collective security.

Such a European system will create effective conditions for European security. It will be a major step forward on this important issue and will create more favorable conditions for solving the German problem on the basis of establishing a unified Germany and making it a peaceful, independent, and democratic country. This will remove the serious obstacles on the road to unifying Germany, obstacles that have been created in recent years by the policy of remilitarizing West Germany and the plan to bring it into the so-called "European Defence Community."

The establishment of an all-European collective security system, coupled with the withdrawal of occupying forces from Germany and an agreed limit on the number of German police, can guarantee the neutralization of Germany before a peace treaty with Germany has been concluded, thereby preventing the inevitable consequence of the revival of German militarism—the revival of a hotbed of war in central Europe.

The conclusion of an all-European treaty will undoubtedly also contribute to the settlement of the Austrian issue, the unresolved state of which is mentioned in the French note, but the governments of France, the United States, and the United Kingdom are responsible for this state of affairs, as they obstructed the conclusion of a peace treaty with Austria at the Berlin Conference, and they have never given up their plan to drag Austria into their military group.

The European collective security system established on the basis of the all-European treaty will be in line with the fundamental interests of the peoples of all countries and will be of decisive significance for easing international tension, because European countries will be united by a common purpose against aggression and a common obligation to take effective measures to eliminate this danger and maintain European security. The maintenance and preservation of European peace will undoubtedly be of extremely great significance for the maintenance of universal peace and for the elimination of the danger of a new world war.

The danger of war has caused legitimate consternation among the peoples of European countries, who only recently experienced the Second World War launched by German militarists. The territories of France, Britain, the Soviet Union, and Poland, as well as other European countries, were engulfed in the flames of war, and the peoples of these countries are more aware than anyone else of the indescribable disasters of another war. The consternation of the peoples of all countries is primarily related to the danger of the use of atomic and hydrogen weapons, especially in view of the fact that the destructive power of these new types of weapons of mass destruction is increasing.

At the same time, it is also necessary to pay attention to the development of new types of weapons such as rocket weapons, which have a range of thousands of kilometers, not to mention the fact that guided rockets equipped with atomic propulsion devices are incomparably more destructive than the "V" missiles that the doomed Hitler group used at the end of the Second World War to destroy some world-famous cultural and civilization centers. In this situation, the task of striving for an international agreement on the unconditional prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons, the reduction of armaments and armed forces of all countries, is of particular importance.

The Soviet government's efforts are precisely to accomplish this task. The Soviet government's proposal for the unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction, as well as the proposal for a substantial reduction of all armaments and armed forces of all countries and compliance with various decisions to establish strict international controls, proves this. The Soviet government's recent proposal that all countries should unconditionally guarantee not to use atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons also proves this, and this proposal will be an important step forward in seeking to completely eliminate atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction from the armaments of all countries and to establish strict international controls over this.

As is known to all, these proposals of the Soviet Union have not received the support of the French government.

The position taken by the French government on this issue is far from proving what the French government said in its note of May 7, that it is committed to disarmament and the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons. On the contrary, this position proves that the French government opposes taking any effective measures in this regard.

The French government's note says that in order to reach an agreement on prohibiting atomic weapons and reducing other weapons, there must be a condition, which is to first create an "atmosphere of security and trust." An "atmosphere of security and trust" is undoubtedly a positive factor in maintaining international security.

However, it should be pointed out that France's policy on the issue of prohibiting the use of atomic energy for military purposes and reducing armaments is contrary to the task of creating an "atmosphere of security and trust"—the task of easing international tension. As is known to all, France's policy is to support the measures pursued by the US government regarding the storage of atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons, these weapons of aggression, and all US plans are based on the use of these weapons, which are considered to occupy a leading position in the US arsenal. This policy is not conducive to creating an "atmosphere of security and trust." Storing atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons, while recently threatening to use these weapons, establishing military bases on foreign territories, the arms race, and organizing military aggressive groups under the banner of "alliance of countries with the same ideas"—all of this will only weaken international trust and deepen international tensions.

On the other hand, the fact of prohibiting atomic weapons and taking measures to reduce other armaments will help to strengthen international trust and create an atmosphere of security.

The widespread campaign waged by the United States to create hatred and hostility among countries and to conduct war propaganda is also contrary to the so-called necessity to create an "atmosphere of security and trust." As early as 1947, the United Nations General Assembly unanimously adopted a resolution condemning any form of war propaganda and stipulating that the governments of all member states of the United Nations have an obligation to take steps to facilitate the strengthening of friendly relations between countries and the dissemination of messages expressing the positive wishes of all countries for peace. However, in the United States, not only are reactionary newspapers that have close ties with certain people with social status, but also many people in responsible positions in government agencies are actively participating in war propaganda.

The frequent anti-Soviet speeches made by US political and military leaders are diametrically opposed to the so-called necessity to create an "atmosphere of security and trust." When making these speeches, they even demanded the continuation and intensification of subversive, sabotage, and terrorist activities in the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. Some people have also demanded the severance of diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union.

They are exerting brutal pressure on many countries, forcing them to obstruct the People's Republic of China from obtaining its legitimate seat in the United Nations, which is an act of infringing upon the sovereignty of the Chinese people.

At the same time, American newspapers are promoting various plans that advocate using military bases to prepare for an attack on the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the people's democratic countries. American newspapers openly say that the purpose of establishing US air force bases is to destroy Soviet industry. According to the plans of US military leaders, those bases from which atomic attacks can be launched against any important target in Russia are given special attention. It is worth noting the war-mongering remarks made by some prominent US military leaders. They demanded that bombers be sent to Moscow and Beijing to drop atomic bombs, although the adventurous nature of this entire propaganda and all the advocacy of these aggressive plans is very clear to every sane person.

The French government says in its note of May 7 that in order to successfully negotiate measures aimed at consolidating peace and guaranteeing international security, it is first necessary to create an "atmosphere of security and trust," but in view of the above, people simply cannot believe these words in the French note. The facts show that not only has the French ruling group not made any effort to create such an atmosphere, but on the contrary, it has taken actions everywhere that are contrary to this.

As for the Soviet Union, it is important to point out that as early as 1951, the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union had already passed a Law on the Defence of Peace. In accordance with the principles of the Soviet peace policy, which strives to consolidate peace and international friendly relations, this law declares any form of war propaganda to be a major crime against humanity and stipulates that those who commit the crime of conducting war propaganda shall be tried as serious offenders.

The Soviet government defends the interests of peace and international cooperation and takes all possible measures to achieve these lofty goals.

The Soviet government is pleased to note that its draft European collective security treaty has received a positive response from a number of European countries, and is not limited to European countries. Even in those countries where officials have taken a negative attitude towards this draft, the broad public is increasingly firmly demanding that European countries work together to guarantee European security. In addition, it should also be taken into account that not all European countries have expressed their views on the proposal to conclude an all-European treaty guaranteeing European collective security.

The Soviet government attaches great importance to carrying out extensive discussions on this issue, because this issue is related to the vital interests of the peoples of European countries. Therefore, the Soviet government believes that it is absolutely necessary to study the issue of European collective security with the participation of representatives of as many European countries as possible.

In accordance with many recent statements, the Soviet government believes that it is appropriate to revise the draft all-European treaty on guaranteeing European collective security and add new provisions on economic cooperation. According to this provision, the participating countries of the treaty will guarantee to take measures to develop trade and other economic relations between countries, which is in line with the vital interests of the peoples of all countries and is in line with the purpose of consolidating peace and strengthening international cooperation.

The agreement on Indochina reached in Geneva on July 21 once again proves that efforts to normalize international relations and to solve not only important international issues in Asia, but also in Europe, will be effective. The Geneva Conference has shown that the path of consultation between countries concerned with consolidating peace and international security can produce positive results.

The Geneva Conference has shown that under certain conditions, the path of consultation between the countries concerned can lead to agreements that are in the interests of the peoples of all countries who are striving for peace and security.

Based on what has been said above, the Soviet government proposes that a conference of all European countries willing to participate, as well as the United States, be convened in the coming months to exchange views on the issue of establishing a European collective security system. The Soviet government believes that it is appropriate for the People's Republic of China to send an observer to attend this conference.

Needless to say, the participants in this conference will not only have the opportunity to state their attitude towards the Soviet proposals, but also have the opportunity to put forward their own proposals on the issue of establishing a European collective security system.

The Soviet government has sent similar notes to the US government and the British government.

    就欧洲集体安全问题
    苏联致法英美三国的照会
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十五日电：二十五日报纸刊载了苏联政府致法国、英国和美国三国政府的关于欧洲集体安全的照会。
    七月二十四日，苏联外交部部长维·米·莫洛托夫接见了法国驻苏大使馆临时代办勒罗伊先生、英国驻苏大使威·海特尔先生、美国驻苏大使馆临时代办伍尔姆斯利先生，并将答复法国、英国、美国三国政府一九五四年五月七日照会的苏联政府照会交给他们。
    法国政府一九五四年五月七日的照会和苏联政府一九五四年七月二十四日的复照，全文如下：
    法国政府一九五四年五月七日照会
    法国大使馆向苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟外交部表示敬意并荣幸地将下列各点通知苏联外交部：
    一、法国政府已和美国、英国以及其他有关国家政府，特别是北大西洋公约组织的成员国政府就四国外长在柏林曾全面讨论过的、苏联政府在其三月三十一日的照会中再次促请法国政府注意的关于欧洲安全问题的那些方面进行了磋商。
    二、法国政府长期以来希望求得普遍的裁减军备，包括禁止原子武器、大规模毁灭性的武器并对原子能建立管制。在联合国原子能委员会、在联合国常规军备委员会以及随后在联合国裁军委员会，法国政府曾力求促成国际裁军协定的缔结，以期结束已使世界各国人民肩负如此沉重负担的扩充军备。这种协定只有在承认在有效的保证下有步骤的和按比例的裁军计划的基础上才能达成，而这种有效的保证应能消除任何的侵略危险，不管侵略是来自何处。法国政府决心竭力促成根据艾森豪威尔总统的倡议而开始的商谈以及很快就又要在联合国开始的裁军问题的商谈的圆满成功。法国政府希望苏联政府也为这些问题的解决而作出建设性的贡献。为了保证这些商谈的成功，首先必须恢复安全和信任的气氛。正是从这一点出发，法国政府重新仔细地研究了苏联政府起初在柏林提出的、后来又在它的三月三十一日照会中加以重申的关于欧洲安全的建议。苏联政府在这些建议中不打算消除造成欧洲紧张局势的真正原因。它反而提出一个新的集体安全条约，而这一条约显然是以德国的中立化和保持德国的分裂为基础的，并原封不动地保持苏联政府在东欧各国施行的片面的政治、经济和军事控制。结果，欧洲就会长期保持不安全和分裂。这些建议，即使在作了关于允许美国参加的修正之后，也是不能作为真正安全的基础。
    四、在联合国组织之外建立一个包括苏联、美国和欧洲所有国家的组织，这丝毫不会加强现在已经存在的世界性的安全组织：它不但没有益处，而且是危险的，因为它必然要使联合国组织遭到破坏。因此法国政府不能接受苏联的建议。如果苏联政府让联合国组织发挥宪章所规定的职能，那末集体安全就会得到最好的保证。
    五、苏联政府同样主张，除它所建议的集体安全条约之外还要以苏联参加大西洋公约的办法来扩大这个公约。无需指出这个建议的绝对不现实的性质。它和以互相信任而紧密联系在一起的西方国家的防御努力和安全所依据的原则直接相反。不单纯是一个军事协定的北大西洋公约组织是建立在本身的自由和尊重权利的原则上。它的成员国的结合在
  一起的防御的手段保证了它的每一个成员国的安全，由于从一九四五年起苏联在欧洲的军事优势，由于苏联已完全地控制了的经济、政治和军事制度向西方的扩展，使它们每个国家无力单独地获得这种安全。北大西洋公约组织完全是防御性的。这个组织的各成员国之间可以自由地和充分地交换情报。这个组织的一切决议都是在一致同意的情况下采取的。如果苏联成为这个组织的成员国，那末它就可以对这个组织的每一项决议使用否决权。这个组织的成员国没有一个会让它们的集体安全体系就此而被破坏。
    六、破坏同一思想的国家的防御联盟和企图代之以新的幻想的安全组织，这决不能巩固欧洲和世界的安全。法国政府仍然认为，只有有步骤地解决每一个问题，才能消除笼罩全世界的缺乏安全的感觉。法国政府认为建立新的安全组织并不能一劳永逸地解决问题，因为这种新的安全组织只不过是掩饰那些严重的困难和分歧的存在而已。
    七、正是出于这一点的考虑，西方国家在柏林提出了一项可作为走向解决德国问题的第一步的计划，而苏联政府甚至连讨论这项计划都不同意。西方国家同样还提出了一些旨在在现有的协议的基础上巩固欧洲安全的建议，而苏联政府又拒绝对这些建议加以审查。西方国家建议接受苏联就对奥和约中一切争执条款提出的条文，而苏联政府不只不同意在它自己已提出的条件下签订条约，并且还提出了新的、难以接受的要求，这些要求完全歪曲了条约的性质，并把一个规定自由和独立的条约变成为
  一个规定让外国军队无限期占领的条约。
    八、苏联政府重复了它在柏林对关于欧洲防务集团的计划所提出的批评意见。法国政府早已就这
  一点发表了自己的意见，它不能同意这样一种说法，即似乎这一作用有限制的计划是造成欧洲分裂的原因或是这一计划使战争的危险增加。欧洲的分裂是苏联政府造成的，它拒绝研究关于在自由选举的基础上统一德国的问题是促使这种分裂永久化的因素之一。在这种情况下，不能让德意志联邦共和国没有防御，尤其是因为东德拥有大量的武装力量，这是连东德的首脑也承认的。法国政府认为，对于各有关方面说来都是最可靠的和最有效的解决德国参加防务问题的方法就是建立这样一个联盟，这个联盟由于它本身性质就能阻止德国采取任何片面的武装行动。
    九、法国政府仍然认为迫切需要改善各国间的关系和保障它们的共同安全。它认为，要想在消除国际紧张局势的根源方面有所进展，最好是苏联政府能具体地证实它有诚意同法国、美国和联合王国政府同心协力来做到下列几点：
    甲、争取尽速解决奥地利问题，以给予奥地利完全的主权和独立；
    乙、争取德国问题的一劳永逸的大家都可接受的解决办法；
    丙、在最近时期内订一项关于普遍的、有步骤的、按比例的和有监督的裁军协定，这项协定应规定禁止原子武器及其他大规模毁灭性的武器、以及通过作出相应的保证来建立对原子能的管制。
    丁、争取在日内瓦会议上解决远东最急迫的问题；
    戊、在联合国采取符合于宪章原则的立场，从而使联合国能完成它的作为集体安全组织的使命。
    苏联政府一九五四年七月二十四日的照会
    苏联政府认为有必要就法国政府五月七日的照会作如下声明：
    从法国政府的上述照会看来，法国政府显然是不同意苏联政府三月三十一日照会中提出的关于缔结保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约问题和关于苏联政府表示准备和有关国家政府共同研究关于苏联参加北大西洋公约问题的意见的。同时，法国政府也没有提出目的在于保障欧洲所有国家的安全的任何建议。如果我们从巩固和平的利益出发，我们就不能认为法国政府对于保障欧洲安全这样一个重要问题采取这样的态度是正当的。
    从上述照会看来，很明显，口口声声说是关心保障欧洲安全的法国政府所采取的立场实际上是不能符合这个目的的，因为，在保障欧洲安全的幌子下面，正在组织一些不让所有其他的国家参加的排他的国家集团。法国的关于按照北大西洋公约组织和“欧洲防务集团”的方式成立“同一思想的国家的联盟”的立场，简单说来就是这样。由此可见，法国政府并没有承认保障所有欧洲国家——不论其社会制度如何——的安全的必要性，反而采取建立排他的国家集团的方针，这个集团奉行服从这些国家的狭隘的集团利益和反对其他社会制度不同的国家的政策。
    但是，这些事实证明，这种变成了军事侵略联盟的集团是不能巩固和平和国际安全的。这些集团和其他国家作对，不可避免地导致军备竞赛，和使国际关系恶化，从而引起新战争。因此，法国政府奉行建立排他的军事集团的政策，是违反所有欧洲国家的安全的利益的，实际上也就是反对保障整个欧洲的安全的。建立这种带有侵略性质的排他的集团是违反联合国组织的原则的，因为这个组织就是在团结一切国家——不问其社会和政治制度如何——的基础上建立的，而且必须倚靠各国之间的合作和集体努力来维护和平和国际安全。破坏联合国的基础和它的国际威信的正是这种排他的军事集团。
    北大西洋公约组织就是这样一个侵略性的军事集团。苏联政府曾一再指出，北大西洋公约组织根本不是防御性的。这个组织完全忽视了德国重新进行侵略的威胁，而且它的目的也不是要防止这种侵略，尽管法国和英国按照它们彼此间的条约以及按照它们和苏联缔结的条约都有义务防止德国重新进行侵略。单单这种情况就充分令人信服地表明了，北大西洋公约组织所追求的目的根本不是要消除在目前情况下的最现实的威胁，这就是德国军国主义复活和随之而来的可能为欧洲各国人民带来新的和更大灾难的德国侵略再起的威胁。在这方面，人们不得不注意一个事实：在组成反希特勒联盟的大国中，只有苏联被排斥于这个组织之外。人们不能不认为这个事实是说明北大西洋公约组织所具有的侵略苏联的性质的清楚证明。
    法国政府五月七日的照会拒绝考虑苏联政府提出的关于苏联参加北大西洋公约组织的可能性问题，这就完全证实了这个组织的侵略性质。
    法国五月七日的照会是从这样一个角度来说明问题的，它硬说：一旦苏联参加了北大西洋公约组织，苏联就会利用它作为这个组织的成员的权利来
  “对这个组织的每一项决议使用否决权”，从而
  “破坏”这个组织。然而，这种论据的不自然和站不住脚是非常明显的，因为苏联并没有要求不同于这个公约的其他参加者的任何特殊地位。
    苏联政府不得不再一次着重指出这个现在正在
  “欧洲防务集团”的幌子下建立的新军事集团所带有的特别危险性。这个集团的纲领和计划将导致德国军国主义的复活，而德国军国主义的复活是威胁整个欧洲的安全、特别是和西德毗邻的国家的安全的。法国政府五月七日的照会硬说“欧洲防务集团”是“由于它本身性质就能阻止德国采取任何片面的武装行动”的一个组织。这种说法是毫无根据的。如果以为现在就有可能用巴黎和波恩条约来使德国军国主义受到某些限制，这就是抹煞历史事实。然而，历史证明：每当军国主义分子和复仇主义分子掌握了德国的命运的时候，德国就不可避免地要走侵略的道路，把它所签订的和承担的关于其他国家的安全的协定和义务变成废纸。
  　因此，实行建立“欧洲防务集团”的计划不能不导致欧洲新战争威胁的加深，而这种威胁的第一批牺牲者将是和西德接壤的国家。只有一个包括所有欧洲国家的国际组织，而不是排他性的军事集团——“欧洲防务集团”式的组织，才能保障欧洲的和平和安全。
    苏联的出发点一向是而且将继续是承认不同社会制度的国家共处的可能性，承认在关心保障国际安全和和平的欧洲各国集体努力的基础上进行国际合作的必要性。
    因此，苏联政府在法、英、美、苏四国柏林外长会议上，提出了关于“保障欧洲安全”的建议，并提出了它的“保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约”草案供会议讨论。苏联所建议的全欧条约的最重要的特点和好处首先是这样一种情况，即所有欧洲国家，不管它们的社会制度如何，都可以参加这个条约。德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国都可以参加这个条约，而在德国统一后，统一的德国也可以参加这个条约。全欧条约的基本原则是，全欧条约的缔约国采取集体行动，来对付一个或一个以上的缔约国在欧洲所受到的武装进攻的威胁。遇有任何一个缔约国受到进攻的事情发生，每一缔约国得以一切可能的方式、包括使用武装部队来援助受到了这种进攻的一个或一个以上的国家，以便恢复并维持欧洲的国际和平和安全。同时，缔约国不得参加其宗旨和保障欧洲集体安全的宗旨相抵触的任何同盟或联盟，或缔结任何这样的协定。
    这样一个欧洲体系将为欧洲的安全创造有效的条件。它将是在这个重要问题上前进的一大步，并将创造更为有利的条件，以便在建立一个统一的德国、使它成为一个和平、独立和民主的国家的基础上来解决德国问题。这将扫除统一德国的道路上的严重障碍，这些障碍是近几年来由于使西德重新军国主义化的政策和使它加入所谓“欧洲防务集团”的计划所造成的。
    全欧集体安全体系的建立，加上占领军撤离德国和大家同意的对德国警察人数的限制，在对德和约尚未缔结以前可以保证德国中立化，从而可以防止复活德国军国主义的必然后果——欧洲中部战争温床的复活。
    缔结全欧条约无疑也将会有助于奥地利问题的解决，关于这个问题的悬而未决状态法国照会中是谈到的，然而应对这种状态负责的是法、美、英三国政府，它们在柏林会议上阻挠了对奥和约的缔结，它们始终没有放弃它们把奥地利拖进它们的军事集团的计划。
    在全欧条约的基础上建立的欧洲集体安全体系将符合于各国人民的根本利益，对于缓和国际紧张局势具有决定的意义，因为欧洲国家将由于有了一个反对侵略的共同目的和有了采取有效措施来消除这种危险并维护欧洲安全的共同义务而联合起来。欧洲和平的保持和维护无疑会对于普遍和平的维持，对于新的世界大战的危险的消除有极其重大的意义。
    战争的危险引起了欧洲各国人民的正当的惶恐心理，他们只是在不久以前才经历过德国军国主义者发动的第二次世界大战。法国、英国、苏联和波兰以及其他欧洲国家的领土曾被卷入战争的火焰中，这些国家的人民比其他任何人都更能意识到另
  一次大战的难以形容的灾难。各国人民的惶恐心理首先和使用原子和氢武器的危险有关的，特别是鉴于这些新式的大规模毁灭性的武器的破坏力是愈来愈大了。
    和这同时，还必须注意到像火箭武器这样的新型武器的发展，火箭武器的射程远达数千公里，还不谈这样一个事实，就是装上原子推进器的定向火箭，比起第二次世界大战结束时，注定失败的希特勒集团用来毁灭了一些世界闻名的文化和文明中心的“V”式飞弹，破坏性要大得无可比拟。在这种情况下，争取在无条件禁止原子武器和氢武器、裁减各国军备和武装部队问题上达成国际协议的任务就具有了特殊的重要性。
    苏联政府的努力正是为了完成这项任务。苏联政府提出的无条件禁止原子武器、氢武器和其他大规模毁灭性武器的建议，以及关于大量裁减各国一切军备和武装部队，遵守各个决定以建立严格国际管制的建议就证明了这一点。苏联政府最近提出的主张各国应该无条件地保证不使用原子武器和氢武器的建议也证明了这一点，这个建议将是在谋求从各国军备中完全取消原子武器、氢武器和其他大规模毁灭性武器，并对此建立严格国际管制的努力中，向前进展的一个重要步骤。
    大家知道，苏联的这些建议没有得到法国政府的支持。
    法国政府对这个问题采取的立场远不能证明法国政府在它的五月七日的照会中所说的那样，它是在致力于裁减军备和禁止原子武器及氢武器的，恰恰相反，这种立场证明了法国政府反对在这方面采取任何有效措施。
    法国政府的照会说，要想在禁止原子武器和裁减其他武器方面达成协议，必须要有一个条件，那就是首先创造一种“安全和信任的气氛”。一种
  “安全和信任的气氛”无疑是维护国际安全的一个积极的因素。
    然而应该指出，法国对于禁止把原子能用于军事目的和裁减军备这一问题的政策是和创造一种
  “安全和信任的气氛”的任务——缓和国际紧张局势的任务——相违背的。大家知道，法国的政策是在于支持美国政府所奉行的关于储存原子武器和氢武器这些侵略武器的措施，美国的一切计划就建筑在使用这些武器的基础之上，这些武器被认为在美国武库中占首要地位。这种政策是无助于创造一种“安全和信任的气氛”的。储存原子武器和氢武器，同时新近又威胁要使用这些武器，在外国领土上设立军事基地，军备竞赛，在“同一思想的国家的联盟”的旗帜下组织军事侵略集团——所有这一切只会削弱国际信任并加深国际紧张关系。
    另一方面，禁止原子武器和采取裁减其他军备的措施这一事实将有助于加强国际信任和创造一种安全的气氛。
    美国进行的在各国间制造仇恨和敌意并进行战争宣传的广泛运动，同样地是和所谓必须创造一种
  “安全和信任的气氛”的说法相违背的。早在一九四七年，联合国大会曾一致通过一项决议，谴责任何形式的战争宣传，并规定联合国各会员国政府有义务采取步骤以便于加强各国间的友好关系和传播为表示各个国家对和平的肯定的愿望的消息。但是，在美国，不只是和一定的拥有社会地位的人士有密切联系的反动报纸，而且许多身居政府机构中负责地位的人也都在积极地参预战争宣传。
    美国政治和军事领袖经常发表的反苏言论是和所谓必须创造一种“安全和信任的气氛”的说法截然相反的。他们在发表这些言论时甚至于要求继续和加紧在苏联和各人民民主国家进行颠覆、破坏和恐怖活动。也还有人要求和苏联断绝外交关系。
    他们对许多国家施行粗暴的压力，强迫它们阻挠中华人民共和国在联合国中取得它的合法地位，这是侵犯中国人民主权的行为。
    同时，美国报纸正在鼓吹各种计划，主张利用军事基地来准备进攻苏联、中华人民共和国和各人民民主国家。美国报纸明目张胆地说，建立美国空军基地的目的是要摧毁苏联的工业。按照美国军事领袖的计划，从哪些基地能够对俄国的任何重要目标发动原子攻击，哪些基地就特别受到重视。值得注意的是美国的一些显要军事领袖发表的好战的言论。他们要求派遣轰炸机到莫斯科和北京上空去投掷原子弹，虽然整个这种宣传以及关于这些侵略计划的一切鼓吹的冒险性质是每一个头脑冷静的人都看得很清楚的。
    法国政府在五月七日的照会中说：为了成功地协商目的在于巩固和平和保障国际安全的措施，必须首先创立一种“安全和信任的气氛”，但鉴于以上所述，人们对法国照会中的这些话就根本不能信以为真。事实说明法国统治集团不但没有作任何努力来创立这样一种气氛，而且相反地处处采取与此相反的行动。
    至于苏联，指出这样一点是很重要的：早在一九五一年，苏联最高苏维埃就已经通过了一个保卫和平法。按照力求巩固和平和国际友好关系的苏联和平政策的原则，这一法律宣布任何形式的战争宣传都是重大的反人类罪行，并规定把犯有进行战争宣传罪的人当作重犯来审讯。
    苏联政府保卫着和平和国际合作的利益，采取了一切可能的措施来实现这些崇高的目的。
    苏联政府满意地注意到，它的欧洲集体安全条约草案已得到一些欧洲国家的积极响应，而且不仅限于欧洲国家。就是在那些官方人士对这个草案采取了一种否定态度的国家里，广大的公众也愈来愈是坚定不移地要求欧洲国家为了保障欧洲安全而通力合作。此外，也应考虑到，并不是所有欧洲国家都已经对缔结一项保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约的建议表示了意见。
    苏联政府十分重视对这个问题展开广泛的讨论，因为这个问题和欧洲各国人民的切身利益有关，因此苏联政府认为在尽可能广泛的欧洲国家代表的参加下研究欧洲集体安全问题是十分必要的。
    按照近来发表的许多言论，苏联政府认为，把保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约草案加以修正，增加经济方面合作的新规定是适宜的。根据这个规定，条约的参与国将保证采取措施发展各国之间的贸易和其他经济关系，这是符合各国人民的切身利益，符合巩固和平和加强国际合作的目的的。
    七月二十一日在日内瓦达成的关于印度支那的协议又一次证明了为了使国际关系正常化，为了不但解决亚洲的，还有欧洲的重要国际问题而作的努力是会有成效的。日内瓦会议已经说明，关心巩固和平和国际安全的国家之间协商的道路是能够产生积极的效果的。
    日内瓦会议已经说明，在某些条件下有关国家协商的道路可以导致符合正在为和平和安全而努力的各国人民的利益的协议。
    根据以上所说的，苏联政府建议，在今后几个月中召集愿意参加会议的一切欧洲国家以及美国举行会议，来就建立欧洲集体安全体系的问题交换意见。苏联政府认为中华人民共和国派遣一名观察员列席这次会议，是适宜的。
    不用说，这次会议的参加者不仅有机会说明他们对苏联建议的态度，并且还有机会对建立欧洲集体安全体系问题提出他们自己的建议。
    苏联政府已把类似的照会分送给美国政府和英国政府。
