    Beijing Ivory Carving
    Wen Ying
    The ivory carving handicraft workers of Beijing, with a long history, have produced many popular works that express the happy life of the people and the ancient art of the motherland in the past year since they were organized.
    Beijing's ivory carvings are famous for their statues. However, in the past, the content of the carvings was mostly superstitious and backward. They often carved the Four Heavenly Kings, Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva, the big-bellied Maitreya Buddha, Guanyin Bodhisattva, as well as morbid Xi Shi and Daiyu. These crafts were exclusively for the appreciation of the reactionary ruling class or for export to capitalist countries. Now, most of the new works are carved from statues provided by the Central Academy of Fine Arts with the help of the government, and some are carved by workers who jointly study famous paintings or photos. Therefore, the quality of the new products has been greatly improved. Statues of Lenin, Stalin, Mao Zedong, and Commander-in-Chief Zhu De have now been carved, as well as farmers sowing, farm women holding fat babies, flower offerings, accordion playing, and saluting Young Pioneers, which embody the real life of the masses. There are also lotus dancers, minority shepherdesses holding lambs, and the two fat babies holding peace doves on the "We Love Peace" poster, as well as the "Flying Apsaras" carved from the ancient art of the Dunhuang murals. Ivory is now being carved into table lamps and smoking sets, with flying apsaras, peace doves, and phoenixes engraved on them. Ivory carving expert Hu Shihui and others used a whole ivory tusk to carve a valuable work showing the panorama of Longevity Hill, which represents our ancient architectural art.
    Some of these new works will be exhibited at the Leipzig Fair in the German Democratic Republic. At the domestic preview, the statue depicting the happy life of the Young Pioneers was well received by the audience. The ivory carving of the panorama of Longevity Hill was exhibited at the Moscow People's Republic of China Agricultural Exhibition last year, and many international friends were attracted by this magical technique. Later, it was transported to the Leipzig Fair for exhibition, and the audience never tired of watching it, causing traffic around the exhibits to be blocked.
    Currently being carved are statues of the patriotic poet Qu Yuan, female students going to school, children ice skating, and the dance of Uyghur girls. The story of the heroic Long March, the daring crossing of the Jinsha River, has been completed. These novel works will soon be exhibited at various exhibitions.

    北京的象牙雕刻
    文英
    有着悠久历史的北京市特种工艺象牙雕刻手工业工人，在组织起来的一年多内，生产了许多表现人民幸福生活和祖国古代艺术的为群众喜爱的作品。
    北京市的象牙雕刻工艺品，是以塑像闻名的。但是过去雕刻的内容，大都是迷信落后的。他们经常雕刻的有四大天王、地藏王菩萨、大肚子弥勒佛、观世音菩萨以及病态的西施、黛玉等。这些工艺品是专供反动统治阶级欣赏或出口给资本主义国家。现在的新作品大多是在政府的帮助下由中央美术学院供给塑像来雕刻的，也有的是工人们共同钻研名画或相片来雕刻的，因此新产品的质量大大提高。现在已雕刻成的有列宁、斯大林、毛主席、朱总司令的塑像，有体现群众现实生活的农民播种、农妇抱着胖娃娃、献花、拉手风琴和敬礼姿态的少年先锋队员，还有荷花舞女、抱着小羊羔的少数民族牧羊女、“我们热爱和平”招贴画上的两个抱着和平鸽的胖娃娃，有吸取古代艺术品敦煌壁画来雕刻的“飞天”。现在还把象牙雕刻成台灯和烟具，上面刻上飞天、和平鸽、凤凰。还有牙刻专家胡士惠等用一颗整象牙雕刻的表现我们古代建筑艺术的有价值的作品万寿山全景。
    这些新作品中，有一部分将去德意志民主共和国来比锡博览会上展出，在国内预展时，表现少年先锋队员愉快生活的塑像，受到观众的好评。象牙雕刻的万寿山全景，去年已在莫斯科中华人民共和国工农业展览会上展览过，很多国际友人都被这种神奇的技巧所吸引住。后来运到来比锡博览会上展出，观众也是百看不厌，使展览品的周围交通为之阻塞。
    现在正在雕刻的有爱国诗人屈原塑像、上学的女学生、溜冰小孩、维吾尔族少女的舞姿等。英勇的长征故事中的一段强渡金沙江已刻完。这些新颖的作品不久即将在各种展览会上展出。
