Xinhua News Agency, July 24th dispatch: London dispatch: The British House of Commons held a meeting on the 22nd, where Foreign Secretary Eden reported on the results of the Geneva Conference regarding Indochina.

Eden first briefly introduced the content of the three agreements and the final declaration of the Geneva Conference on the cessation of hostilities and restoration of peace in Indochina. He believed that these agreements were a "real gain for peace" and "the best agreement that could be managed in the current environment." He also pointed out: "If these agreements were not reached, the only other path would be to continue the war. This would bring more pain and suffering, and would inevitably end with even greater sacrifices. Moreover, there is an even greater danger for all of us: as long as this war continues, there is always the danger that the conflict will spread, bringing incalculable consequences."

Eden said: "It has also been clearly understood that none of these three countries (the three countries of Indochina) may allow the establishment of foreign military bases on their territory, nor may they participate in military alliances. The purpose is to ensure that each of these three countries can live their own peaceful lives. This is undoubtedly a matter of lasting concern to all countries participating in the conference."

Eden emphasized: "We must not only see the ceasefire plan, but also see the spirit behind it, and this spirit depends on the efforts of both sides. Of course, I hope that this result will lead to improved relations in other places."

When Eden finished speaking, the entire chamber erupted in enthusiastic cheers.

Herbert Morrison, leader of the opposition Labour Party, spoke and welcomed Eden's report. He said: "Because of the ceasefire, the entire House and the Foreign Secretary share the same sense of relief. The ceasefire itself is a major gain, and we are very pleased with this."

Other members of Parliament also expressed their satisfaction with the achievements of the Geneva Conference.

A group of Labour MPs submitted a motion in the House of Commons. The motion warmly welcomed the agreements signed at the Geneva Conference and hoped that this method of resolving international disputes through peaceful negotiations would be applied to international issues such as the German question.

    艾登在英下院报告日内瓦会议关于印度支那问题的结果
    希望这个结果会导向其他地区关系的改善
    议员纷纷对会议成就表示欣慰全场欢呼
   【新华社二十四日讯】伦敦消息：英国下院在二十二日举行会议，外交大臣艾登报告了日内瓦会议关于印度支那问题的结果。
    艾登首先简单介绍了日内瓦会议关于在印度支那停战和恢复和平的三项协定和最后宣言的内容。他认为这些协定是“和平的真正收获”，是“目前环境下所能设法得到的最好的协定。”他并且指出：“如果不达成这些协议，唯一的另外一条路就是继续作战。这就要带来更多的痛苦和苦难，而且最后必然是以更大的牺牲收场。不仅如此，对我们所有的人还有一个更大的危险：只要这场战争继续下去，就永远有冲突蔓延开来以至于带来无可估量的后果的危险。”
    艾登说：“也取得明白的谅解：这三个国家中（印度支那三国）的任何一国都不得容许在它们的领土上建立外国军事基地，也不得参加军事联盟。其目的在于保证这三个国家中每一个国家都能过它们自己的和平生活。这无疑地是所有参与会议的国家所永远关心的。”
    艾登强调说：“我们必须不只看到停战计划，而且要看到它后面的精神，而这种精神是有赖于双方的努力的。当然，我希望这个结果会导向其他地方的关系的改善。”
    艾登发言完毕，全场响起了热烈的欢呼声。
    反对党工党领袖赫伯特·摩里逊发言，对艾登的报告表示欢迎。他说：“由于停火，全下院和外交大臣具有同样的如释重负的感觉。停火本身就是一个重大收获，我们对这一点感到非常高兴。”
    其他的议员也对日内瓦会议的成就表示欣慰。
      一部分工党议员在下院提出了一项动议。动议对日内瓦会议所签订的协定表示热烈欢迎，并且希望把这种通过和平谈判来解决国际争端的办法，应用到像德国问题那样的国际问题上面。
