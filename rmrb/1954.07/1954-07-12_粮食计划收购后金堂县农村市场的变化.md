    Changes in the Rural Market of Jintang County After the Grain Planned Purchase
    Guo Hong Yun Qiu
    Jintang County, Sichuan Province, has a population of more than 630,000 in over 141,800 farm households, with more than 1,245,436 mu of farmland. In recent years, thanks to government support, agricultural products have seen consecutive bumper harvests, and rural purchasing power has significantly increased. According to a typical survey conducted by the county government in the Second Village of Yangliu Township, Second District, and the Sixth Village of Tongxing Township, Sixth District: in 1951, the average purchasing power per person was 265,740 yuan; in 1952, it was 300,630 yuan; and in 1953, it reached 366,532 yuan. The increase in rural purchasing power has brought about significant changes in the rural market, especially after the publicity of the general task of the country during the transition period and the implementation of the unified purchase and sale of grain.
    
    Growing Need for Means of Production
    Due to the high production enthusiasm of farmers, investment in production has increased compared to the past. The sales of livestock, fertilizers, and farm tools throughout the county have increased compared to previous years. According to preliminary statistics, since the implementation of the grain planned purchase last year, the county has increased its stock of draft cattle by more than 310 heads, cooperatives have supplied more than 43,440 pieces of large and small farm tools, and more than 1,470,000 jin of fertilizer, exceeding the amount of means of production supplied during the same period in previous years by more than four times.
    
    The expansion of farmers' investment in production can also be illustrated by the following figures: in 1952, the money spent on purchasing means of production accounted for 18.05% of the purchasing power; in 1953, it accounted for 21.25%; and this year, it suddenly increased to approximately 40.7%. The Wu Shishou Mutual Aid Team in Sanxing Township, Fourth District, consisting of 22 households, had 4.8 million yuan available for the market from December 1952 to April 1953 (including 1.8 million yuan in state loans). At that time, the team spent 300,000 yuan on purchasing fertilizer and adding farm tools for spring production, accounting for 6.2% of the total purchasing power. From December 1953 to April this year, they had more than 4,660,000 yuan (including 460,000 yuan in state loans), and spent 1,045,200 yuan on purchasing fertilizer and adding farm tools for spring production, accounting for 22.43% of the total purchasing power.
    
    However, state-owned commercial and cooperative departments have an inadequate understanding of the increase and changes in the use of rural purchasing power. They believe that "investigation and research work does not necessarily solve the problem," and therefore only make general estimates based on past historical situations when formulating supply plans. Although the quantity of supplies has been expanded compared to previous years, the arrangement of means of production and means of livelihood in the supply plan is very inappropriate. For example, the state-owned department store planned to supply a total value of 5 billion yuan of general merchandise and cloth in the first quarter, but only completed 72% of the task. On the other hand, the supply of means of production planned by grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions is generally felt to be insufficient. For example, in the second, fourth, and sixth districts, grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives ran out of agricultural tools such as mats, bamboo tubes, and hoes before the spring plowing production had fully unfolded, affecting farmers' production.
    
    The Need for Means of Livelihood is Also Expanding
    Although the proportion of rural purchasing power spent on means of livelihood has relatively decreased, the demand for means of livelihood is still increasing. Moreover, with the rise of rural purchasing power, the variety of means of livelihood needed has also changed. In the past, only blue cloth and indigo cloth were popular in rural areas, and farmers mostly used them to make outer garments. However, since the second half of last year, white cloth, printed cloth, and indanthrene blue cloth have also been selling well. Farmers not only use them to make outer garments, but also to make bedsheets, underwear, and lined clothing. Farmers' demands for the patterns and varieties of industrial products are also increasing. Taking the blue cloth supplied by the state-owned department store as an example, although farmers used to like blue cloth, they only liked to buy light-colored 101 worker-peasant blue cloth. Now they like to buy dark-colored 303, 404 worker-peasant blue cloth and 440 Shanghai blue cloth, as well as student blue cloth. The same is true for purple cloth. In the past, farmers only liked to buy dark-colored ones, but now they also like to buy light-colored ones. At the same time, the requirements for the quality of goods are also higher than in the past. In the past, the celebration blue cloth supplied by the state-owned department store was very popular, but now farmers complain that this blue cloth is easy to turn red and fade, and they do not welcome it.
    
    Among the varieties of means of livelihood, there is also a change: some commodities that could only be sold in cities in the past, such as children's diapers, bibs, and hats; and adults' rubber shoes, undershirts and pants, and processed shirts, are gradually finding a market in rural areas. The main reasons are: on the one hand, rural purchasing power has increased; and on the other hand, with the expansion of production, many women have joined mutual aid teams or agricultural production cooperatives and do not have more time to do needlework for adults and children. They reflect: "Industrial products are both cheaper, more durable, and better-looking. Why must we make them ourselves to wear? We don't have so much free time to sew them stitch by stitch!"
    
    This has led to a large increase in the supply of industrial daily necessities. From December of last year to April of this year, the retail department of the state-owned department store supplied various commodities worth 1,314,700,000 yuan, an increase of 31.62% compared to the supply during the same period of the previous year.
    
    In organizing the supply, it is necessary to pay attention to adapting to this new situation. However, it is also inappropriate to overestimate rural purchasing power. Cadres of the Jintang County State-Owned Department Store did not study this point well, believing that "the problem of promoting industrial products is not a big one since rural purchasing power has increased," and thus blindly purchased goods. For example, in the second half of last year, they purchased 851 dozen undershirts and pants, plus the original stock of 951 dozen, exceeding farmers' needs by 1.65 times. In the first quarter of this year, they purchased 20 bolts of 750 ramie cloth, which was of good quality but too expensive, and as a result, not a single bolt was sold. Farmers reflected: "We need it, but it's too expensive." Due to blind purchasing, the inventory backlog is large, and the capital turnover is not smooth, making it impossible to supply many commodities that are urgently needed by farmers.
    
    The Seasonal Difference is Gradually Shrinking
    Another change in the rural market is the gradual shrinking of the seasonal difference. After farmers sell their surplus grain in a concentrated manner, they gradually invest the money from the sale of grain into the market to purchase the means of production necessary for their spring production and the means of livelihood needed for the season, thereby making the peak season of the market earlier than any previous year by two or three months. In the Third Village of Sanxing Township, 309 households purchased large and small farm tools and fertilizers from December of last year to January of this year, and more than 150 households also bought spring clothes.
    
    This shows that after farmers sell their surplus grain in a concentrated manner, they will invest the money from the sale of grain into the market as early as possible. The situation in the past, where they sold in order to buy and sold a little grain at a certain time to exchange for some necessities, resulting in a large seasonal difference in the market, is gradually changing. This requires state-owned commercial and cooperative departments to appropriately balance the supply plans for each quarter and even each month when formulating supply plans, so as not to create a situation of simultaneous backlog and stock-out.
    
    However, the state-owned department store is still not doing enough in this regard. It did not estimate the gradual change in the seasonal difference, believing that the off-season and peak season were "probably about the same" as in previous years. Therefore, the supply plan was not arranged properly. For example, the plan for April and June in the second quarter of this year was very small, and the plan for May was larger. As a result, the plan for April was exceeded by 32%, and the inventory was empty, unable to meet the market demand. They had to temporarily organize sources of goods. The same is true for supply and marketing cooperatives, believing that March and April were off-seasons, so the supply plan was arranged to be smaller, and believing that May was a peak season, the supply plan was arranged to be larger. As a result, the goods stored in March and April were not enough to supply, and some commodities, such as farm tools, were out of stock, forcing them to rush to manufacture and organize sources of goods, causing business chaos.
    
    Strengthen Market Arrangement Work
    In the past, state-owned commercial departments lacked the understanding that state-owned commerce is the commerce of the state and is responsible for the unified arrangement of the market. They also felt that it did not matter if cooperatives did not purchase goods from their own departments, thinking that they could complete the task without relying on cooperatives. Cooperatives, on the other hand, had a purely profit-making viewpoint, preferring to purchase goods from other places rather than purchasing goods locally or only purchasing a few popular goods. As a result, the relationship between state-owned commerce and cooperatives was not very coordinated for a long time. They did not contact each other, and the plans were not coordinated, resulting in frequent stock backlogs in state-owned commercial departments and frequent stock-outs in cooperative departments. Neither could smoothly complete the national plan, so that speculative private merchants took the opportunity to exploit loopholes and disrupt the market.
    
    Since the beginning of the implementation of the grain planned purchase, local party and government leaders have specially convened meetings of financial and economic cadres. Through the study of the general task, they focused on criticizing the erroneous thinking existing in state-owned commercial and cooperative departments, and studied the issue of unified market arrangements. As a result, the relationship between state-owned commerce and cooperatives began to become closer, and they coordinated their actions, organized supplies, and expanded their businesses. At the same time, under the leadership of the local party committee, state-owned commercial departments signed supply contracts with industries that were beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood based on the actual local situation, organized them to go to the countryside to attend market fairs, and gave play to the business enthusiasm of private merchants. The four larger industries in Zhao Du Town: cloth, general merchandise, food groceries, and Chinese medicine, totaling 166 households, after studying the general task, and through the business leadership and guidance of state-owned commercial and cooperative departments, made the 22 households that were originally operating passively operate actively, and the 14 households that had already closed down reopened, and 2 households increased their capital and expanded their business operations. Due to the close cooperation between state-owned commercial and cooperative departments and the strengthening of leadership over private merchants, the rural primary market was more active than before, and the business situation of state-owned commerce, cooperatives, and private commerce was also very normal. In the first quarter of this year, the turnover of state-owned commerce increased by 51.1% compared to the same period last year, accounting for 25.5% of the total social commodity turnover; the turnover of cooperatives increased by 274.7%, accounting for 17.6% of the total social commodity turnover; and the turnover of private commerce also increased by 43.5%, accounting for 56.9% of the total social commodity turnover. Although the proportion of private commerce's turnover in the total social commodity turnover decreased by 11.5% compared to the same quarter last year, the absolute number of turnover still increased by about one time compared to last year.
    
    However, there are still some problems in the unified arrangement of the market. First of all, cadres of state-owned commercial departments do not have a clear understanding of the idea of ​​long-term reliance on and support for cooperatives to expand operations in rural areas in order to ensure the growth of socialist components. Therefore, they are still not doing enough to regularly help grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives develop their businesses. Some cadres now believe that cooperatives will come to purchase goods themselves, and their business does not require assistance, so that the proportion of cooperatives purchasing goods from state-owned commerce has declined month by month, from 52.26% from December of last year to the end of March of this year to 34.36%, which seriously affects the supply in rural areas. Some cadres in the cooperative sector still do not have a clear understanding of relying on state-owned commerce as a strong assistant to state-owned commerce. The grassroots supply and marketing cooperative in the Fourth District, which operates kerosene, heard that the price in Chengdu was 240 yuan cheaper per kilogram than in Jintang County, so they purchased more than 2,000 kilograms from Chengdu (the local sales volume is about 600 kilograms per month), while the kerosene that the Jintang County State-Owned Department Store planned to supply to the area in the first quarter was backlogged. In addition, cadres of state-owned commercial and cooperative departments are not doing enough to carry out the socialist transformation of private commerce, and they also lack an understanding of the fact that the transformation of private commerce is a serious class struggle. Some cadres believe that merchants have studied the general task and have also signed supply contracts with state-owned commerce, so they think there is no problem. Therefore, they have not further relied on shop assistants, strengthened the education of merchants in patriotism and compliance with the law, and have not inspected the implementation of the contracts. When this situation was discovered, they felt that the work of transforming private merchants was not easy to do, and they developed negative emotions. All of these should be improved in future work.
    
    From the above situation, in order to do a good job in rural supply work, state-owned commercial and cooperative departments must, under the leadership of the local party and government, cooperate closely, unify their pace, pay close attention to the new situation of the market, conscientiously do a good job in investigation and research work, and correctly implement the country's commercial policies. Only in this way can they correctly organize sources of goods, give play to various forces, expand the sales of goods, better meet rural needs, and complete the country's commodity sales plan.

    粮食计划收购后金堂县农村市场的变化
    郭虹  韵秋
    四川省金堂县共有十四万一千八百多农户，六十三万多人口，一百二十四万五千四百三十六亩多田地。几年来，由于政府的扶持，农产品连年丰收，农村购买力显著上升。据该县人民政府在二区杨柳乡二村和六区同兴乡六村的典型调查：一九五一年平均每人购买力为二十六万五千七百四十元；一九五二年为三十万零六千零三十元；一九五三年高达三十六万六千五百三十二元。农村购买力的提高，给农村市场带来很大的变化，特别是宣传了国家过渡时期的总任务和实行粮食统购统销以后，农村市场的变化更大。
    生产资料需要增长
    由于农民生产情绪高涨，对生产的投资较过去增多了。全县牲畜、肥料、农具的销量都比往年增多，据初步统计，全县自去年粮食计划收购后，共增加了耕牛三百一十多头，合作社供应的大小农具四万三千四百四十多件，肥料一百四十七万多斤，超过了往年同时期生产资料供应数量四倍以上。
    农民对生产投资的扩大，也可从下面的数字中得到说明：一九五二年购买生产资料的钱占购买力的百分之十八点零五，一九五三年占百分之二十一点二五，今年突增至约占百分之四十点七。四区三星乡吴世首互助组共有二十二户人，一九五二年十二月到一九五三年四月，全组可投到市场上的货币有四百八十万元（其中有国家贷款一百八十万元），当时为大春生产购买肥料、添制农具共用去三十万元，占全部购买力百分之六点二；一九五三年十二月到今年四月，有四百六十六万多元（其中国家贷款四十六万元），为大春生产购买肥料、添制农具共用去一百零四万五千二百元，占全部购买力百分之二十二点四三。
    但是，国营商业和合作社部门对农村购买力的增长以及使用的变化是认识不足的。他们认为：“做了调查研究工作也不一定解决问题”，因而只是一般地根据以往历史情况加以估计，订出了供应计划。虽然，供应的数量比往年扩大了，但供应计划中对生产资料和生活资料的安排很不得当，如国营百货商店计划在第一季度供应百货、布匹等生活资料总值五十亿元，结果仅完成任务百分之七十二；而各地供销合作社计划供应的生产资料又普遍感到不足，如二、四、六等区基层供销合作社在春耕生产还未全面展开时，晒席、箩管、锄头等农具就告脱销了，影响了农民生产。
    生活资料需要也在扩大
    虽然，农村购买力在生活资料方面比重相对地下降了，但生活资料的需要量还在增加。并且，随着农村购买力的上升，对生活资料需要的品种也起了变化。以往农村仅有青布、蓝布畅销，农民多用来做面衣，但自去年下半年以后，白布、花布、阴丹布都有销路了，农民不仅用来做面衣，而且用来做被单、内衣、夹衣等。农民对工业品的花色、品种的要求也愈来愈多。就国营百货商店供应的蓝布来说，以往农民虽喜欢蓝布，但只喜欢买浅色的一零
  一工农蓝布，而现在喜欢买深色的三零三、四零四工农蓝布和四四零上海蓝布以及学生蓝布了。紫色布也有同样情况，以往农民只喜欢买深色的，而现在也喜欢买浅色的了。同时对商品质量的要求也较过去提高，过去国营百货商店供应的庆祝蓝布很吃香，现在农民则嫌这种蓝布容易翻红脱色而表示不欢迎了。
    在生活资料的品种中，还有一个变化，就是有些过去只能在城市销的商品，如小孩的尿布、围腰、帽子；大人穿的胶鞋、卫生衫裤、加工衬衣等在农村都逐渐有了销路。主要原因：一方面由于农村购买力提高；而另一方面则随着生产的扩大，好些妇女都参加了互助组或农业生产合作社，没有更多的时间来给大人小孩做针活，她们反映：“工业品既便宜、又牢靠、又好看，何必一定要自己做来穿，也没有那样多空闲时间一针一线来缝呀！”
    这种情况，就使工业日用品的供应数量有了很大增加，国营百货商店零售门市部去年十二月至今年四月就供应了各种商品十三亿一千四百七十万元，较前年同时期的供应量上升了百分之三十一点六二。
    在组织供应时，必须注意要适应这一新的情况。但是，把农村购买力估计得过高，也是不适当的。金堂县国营百货商店干部就没有很好地研究这一点，认为：“农村购买力提高了，推销工业品问题不大了”，于是盲目进货。如去年下半年，购进卫生衫裤八百五十一打，加上原来库存共九百五十一打，超过了农民的需要量一点六五倍，今年一季度购进七五零夏布二十匹，质量虽好，但价格太高，结果一匹也卖不掉，农民反映：“需要都需要，就是太贵了。”由于盲目进货，结果库存积压很大，资金周转不灵，使许多为农民迫切需要而可以供应的商品反而供应不上。
    季节差别逐渐缩小
    农村市场的另一个变化，是季节差别的逐渐缩小。农民集中地卖出余粮以后，都将卖粮的钱陆续投入市场，购买他们大春生产所必需的生产资料和季节需要的生活用品，从而使得市场的旺季比过去任何一年都提前了两三个月。三星乡三村三百零九户人，从去年十二月到今年一月，就有六十多户人购买了大小农具和肥料，有一百五十多户人还买了春季的衣衫。
    这说明：农民集中地卖出余粮后，就会及早把卖粮所得的货币投入市场，过去为买而卖、在一定的时候出卖一点粮食换回一点必需品，造成市场季节差别很大的情况逐渐在改变了。这就要求国营商业和合作社部门在制订供应计划时，要适当平衡每季度以至每月的供应计划，这样才不致造成一面积压一面脱销的局面。
    但国营百货商店在这点上仍做得不够，没有估计到季节差别的逐渐变化，以为淡季旺季和往年
  “大概差不多”，因此供应计划安排不很得当，如今年第二季度四、六两个月计划安排很小，五月份安排得较大，结果四月份突破计划百分之三十二，库存空虚，不能满足市场要求，只好临时组织货源。供销合作社方面也有同样情况，认为三、四月份是淡季，于是供应计划安排得小些，认为五月份是旺季，供应计划安排得大一些，结果三、四月份储备的物资不够供应，有些商品如农具等脱销，迫得临时赶制和组织货源，造成业务的紊乱。
    加强市场安排工作
    过去，国营商业部门对国营商业是国家的商业，负有统一安排市场的责任是缺乏认识的。对合作社不在自己部门进货，也认为没有关系，以为不依靠合作社同样可以完成任务；合作社则存在着单纯的营利观点，宁肯从外地进货而不在当地进货或只进少数畅销货，这样，国营商业和合作社之间的关系长期不很协调，互相不联系，计划不卸接，结果造成国营商业部门商品经常积压，合作社部门则经常脱销，都不能顺利完成国家计划，以致投机私商乘机钻空子，捣乱市场。
    自开始实行粮食计划收购后，当地党、政领导上专门召开了财经干部会议，通过总任务的学习，着重批判了存在在国营商业和合作社部门中的错误思想，研究统一安排市场问题，从而使得国营商业与合作社之间的关系开始密切了，彼此协同动作，组织供应，扩大了业务。同时，在当地党委领导下，国营商业部门根据当地实际情况，分别对有利于国计民生的行业，与他们签订了供应合同，组织他们下乡赶集，发挥了私商的经营积极性。赵渡镇四个较大的行业：布匹、日用百货、食品杂货、国药，共一百六十六户，经过总任务的学习，在国营商业和合作社部门通过业务的领导和指导之后，使原来消极经营的二十二户积极经营起来了，原来已经歇业的十四户重新开业了，并有两户增加了资金、扩大了业务经营。由于国营商业和合作社部门的密切合作，加强了对私商的领导，从而使农村初级市场较前活跃，国营商业、合作社、私营商业的营业情况也很正常。今年第一季度国营商业营业额比去年同期上升百分之五十一点一，占社会商品流转总额百分之二十五点五；合作社营业额上升百分之二百七十四点七，占社会商品流转总额百分之十七点六；私营商业营业额也上升百分之四十三点五，占社会商品流转总额百分之五十六点九。虽然私营商业的营业额占社会商品流转总额的比重较去年同季度下降百分之十一点五，但营业额的绝对数仍比去年上升约一倍。
    但是，在统一安排市场方面，还存在着一些问题。首先是国营商业部门干部对长期依靠和扶持合作社以扩大对农村的经营，以保证社会主义成分的增长这个思想不明确，因而对经常帮助基层供销合作社开展业务这一点还做得不够。现在有些干部认为合作社自己会来进货，业务用不到帮助，以致合作社在国营商业进货比重逐月下降，从去年十二月起到今年三月底止，由百分之五十二点二六下降到百分之三十四点三六，严重影响了农村的供应。合作部门有些干部对依靠国营商业作为国营商业有力的助手这一点仍然不够明确。四区基层供销合作社经营煤油，听说成都价格比金堂县每公斤便宜二百四十元，就到成都进货二千多公斤（该地的销售量每月约六百多公斤），而金堂县国营百货商店计划在第一季度供应该地的煤油就积压起来了。此外，国营商业和合作社部门干部对私营商业的社会主义改造还做得不够，并且对改造私营商业是一场严重的阶级斗争也认识不足。有些干部认为商人经过总任务的学习，和国营商业也已签订了供应合同，以为就没有问题了，因而就没有进一步依靠店员，加强对商人的爱国守法的教育，对合同的执行情况也没有进行检查，有一部分商户即乘机不认真执行合同。当这一情况发现后，又认为改造私商工作不好做，产生了消极情绪，所有这些都应该在今后工作中加以改进的。
    从以上情况看来，为做好农村供应工作，国营商业和合作部门必须在当地党、政的领导下，密切合作，统一步调，切实注意市场的新情况，认真作好调查研究工作，并正确贯彻国家的商业政策，只有这样，才能正确组织货源，发挥各种力量，扩大商品销路，更好地满足农村需要和完成国家的商品销售计划。
