Feedback on Readers’ Criticisms and Suggestions to the People’s Daily

    The Rolling Stock Bureau of the Ministry of Railways Has Noticed and is Correcting Shortcomings in Rolling Stock Repair Work
    A letter from the Rolling Stock Bureau of the Central Ministry of Railways: The "Reader's Letters Summary" column on March 11 published three letters from readers under the title "Vehicle Repair Quality Should Be Improved," exposing the situation that some railway vehicle departments neglected the quality of vehicle repairs, violated railway technical management regulations, and mutually released technically defective vehicles. This criticism is completely correct. In order to correct this shortcoming, the Ministry of Railways promulgated the train inspection technical operation process at the end of 1953 (this is the main method to improve the quality of train inspections); in the first quarter of 1954, it launched various bureaus to sign train inspection mutual guarantee contracts, strictly prohibiting the mutual release of technically defective vehicles. However, due to the lack of in-depth work by the leadership of many vehicle departments and the existence of departmentalism in various sections, the situation of mutually releasing technically defective vehicles still exists.
    After the People's Daily published the readers' letters of criticism, we held a national telephone conference of vehicle departments in March. Based on the situation published in the People's Daily, we criticized the shortcomings in vehicle repair work and ordered the relevant bureaus to conduct inspections and reviews. On April 11, we focused on this issue again at the National Vehicle Conference, and the heads of the vehicle departments of each bureau made self-criticisms at the meeting. At the meeting, measures were formulated to ensure the technical quality of freight trains, in order to unify the national train quality standards. In order to solve the long-term problems of staff and material shortages in various train inspection stations, in addition to the supplementary personnel already stipulated this year according to the train inspection technical operation process, the National Vehicle Conference also decided to announce the quantitative determination of train inspection material reserves, to be fully supplemented in the second quarter.
    Recently, the situation of mutually releasing technically defective vehicles has been visibly reduced, and the substandard repair rate has reached the prescribed standards. We must continue to work hard and strive to improve the quality of repairs and reduce the substandard rate.

### 铁道部车辆局已注意纠正车辆检修工作中的缺点

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    铁道部车辆局已注意纠正车辆检修工作中的缺点
    中央铁道部车辆局来信：三月十一日“读者来信摘要”栏以“应该提高车辆检修质量”为题发表了三封读者来信，揭发了某些铁路车辆部门忽视车辆检修质量，违反铁路技术管理规程，互放技术不良车的情况。这个批评是完全正确的。为了纠正这个缺点，铁道部曾在一九五三年末公布了列检技术作业过程（这是提高列检质量的主要办法）；一九五四年第一季度内又发动各局签订了列检互保合同，严禁互放技术不良车。但是，由于不少车辆部门领导方面工作不深入，各段存在着本位主义思想，互放技术不良车的情况仍然存在。
    人民日报刊登了读者的批评信后，我们在三月份召开了全国车辆部门电话会议，根据人民日报上刊登的情况，对车辆检修工作中的缺点进行了批判，并责成各有关局进行检查和检讨。四月十一日，我们在全国车辆会议上又着重地提出了这个问题，各局车辆处长在会议上作了检讨。会上制订了保证货物列车技术质量办法，以便统一全国列车质量标准。为了解决各列检所长期缺员、缺料问题，除今年已经规定按列检技术作业过程查定补充人员外，在全国车辆会议上又决定公布列检材料储备定量，于第二季度内补充齐全。
    最近互放技术不良车的情况已日见减少，检修不良率已达规定标准。我们还要继续努力，为提高检修质量、降低不良率而斗争。
