    Only in a Socialist Society Can Atomic Energy Serve the National Economy
    Qian Sanqiang, Director of the Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences
    The Soviet Council of Ministers recently issued a communique on the start of electricity generation by the Soviet Union's first atomic energy industrial power station. The communique pointed out that Soviet scientists and engineers had successfully completed the design and construction of the Soviet Union's first atomic energy industrial power station, which began generating electricity on June 27, supplying industrial and agricultural uses in nearby areas, with a power generation capacity of 5,000 kilowatts. Soviet scientists and engineers are designing atomic energy industrial power stations with a power generation capacity of 50,000 to 100,000 kilowatts. This is the first time in human history that atomic energy has been used for industrial production, laying the foundation for the unlimited future of mankind using new power sources. Peace-loving people all over the world, the working people of our country, and the scientific workers of our country are extremely excited upon hearing this news and warmly celebrate this great achievement.
    Since the discovery of radioactivity by Becquerel in France at the end of the 19th century and the discovery of radium by the Curies, peace-loving scientific workers all over the world, who wanted to discover the secrets of nature, conquer nature, and create prosperity and happiness for mankind, have worked tirelessly and finally laid the scientific foundation for the application of atomic energy in 1940. However, this great discovery was immediately seized by American imperialism, which used it to manufacture atomic weapons, threatening the world and creating international tension. Contrary to American imperialism, since the Soviet Union mastered the scientific laws of atomic energy, it first used atomic explosions to create the necessary conditions for huge water conservancy projects. Later, because the Soviet Union mastered various types of atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs, American imperialism did not dare to openly launch a third world war. Today, the Soviet Union has created an excellent example for all countries in the world for the peaceful industrial use of atomic energy.
    Why is it that the same scientific discovery, the mastery of a natural law, in the hands of American imperialism means a threat of war, international tension, a more intense enslavement of oppressed nations, and the persecution of scientific workers; while conversely, in the hands of the Soviet people, it represents peace, hope for the bright future of mankind, relaxation of international tension, the liberation of enslaved people, and the prosperity of science?
    I think this should be explained from the perspective of different social systems. Stalin taught us that the main features and requirements of the basic economic law of capitalism are: to ensure maximum capitalist profit by exploiting and bankrupting and impoverishing the majority of the population of one's own country, by enslaving and continuously plundering the people of other countries, especially the people of backward countries, and by means of wars and militarization of the national economy aimed at ensuring maximum profits. The driving force of monopoly capitalism is maximum profit. Therefore, after World War II, American imperialism tightly grasped the atomic bomb, strengthened the enslavement and plunder of the colonies of Britain, France, Japan, and Italy; strengthened economic aggression against Asian, African, South American, and European countries, establishing aggressive military bases on their territories, and gradually turning most of these countries into vassal states; launched a war in Korea, and supported and gradually replaced French imperialism's war against the Vietnamese people. In order to maintain the so-called atomic energy secret, it fabricated unreasonable laws, preventing the exchange of scientific achievements, and shamelessly fabricated baseless charges to kill the innocent and righteous Rosenbergs. Recently, it has even intensified its persecution of Oppenheimer, the scientist who made the first batch of atomic bombs for them. Such high-pressure tactics have prevented the full development of nuclear physics, while making those engaged in nuclear work feel that their lives are in danger at all times. In short, the liberation of atomic energy has a sudden and transformative significance for the development of productive forces and should bring happiness to mankind. However, due to the basic nature of capitalist society, when it is controlled by American imperialism, it brings disaster to mankind, science, and scientific workers.
    Stalin also taught us that the main features and requirements of the basic economic law of socialism are: to ensure the maximum satisfaction of the constantly growing material and cultural needs of the entire society by means of the continuous growth and continuous improvement of socialist production on the basis of high technology. This basic law clearly illustrates the Soviet Union's consistent policy of peace, because only world peace can guarantee the continuous economic and cultural development of the people. In his report to the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Malenkov pointed out: "Although the Soviet state has mastered the practical possibility of producing atomic energy, it is eager to use this new type of energy for peaceful purposes, for the happiness of the people, because such use of atomic energy can infinitely expand mankind's control over the spontaneous forces of nature, giving mankind enormous possibilities to increase productivity, make progress in technology and culture, and increase social wealth."
    Recently, a series of diplomatic activities by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov have promoted the easing of international tensions, allowing enslaved people to see the prospects for liberation. In the short few years after the war, the Soviet Union has successively discovered and mastered the methods of producing atomic weapons for the purpose of defending the socialist motherland and world peace, and now it is the first to master the method of using atomic energy to produce electricity. This undeniably proves the rapid progress of Soviet science, and this rapid development of science is inseparable from the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system. The liberation of atomic energy should bring happiness to mankind, but the results produced under different social systems can be completely opposite. Only under the socialist system will atomic energy be used to ensure the maximum satisfaction of the constantly growing material and cultural needs of the entire society.
    Chinese scientific workers have recognized the high level of Soviet science and technology from the facts, and at the same time, they have realized that the advanced science of the Soviet Union, which has occupied the first place in the world in major scientific fields, is inseparable from the superiority of the Soviet socialist social system. Today, the glorious achievement of the Soviet Union's first use of atomic energy in peaceful industry has further strengthened our confidence in dedicating ourselves to the socialist industrialization construction of the motherland. We will strive to learn from the advanced science and technology of the Soviet Union, learn from the spirit of Soviet scientists in serving the cause of peace and the people, learn from the Marxist-Leninist methodology that Soviet scientists have mastered, and apply it to our practical work. Only in this way can we rapidly improve the level of science and technology in our country, cultivate a large number of young scientific and technological talents, and thus promote the rapid advancement of socialist industrialization.

    只有在社会主义社会中原子能才能为国民经济服务
    中国科学院物理研究所所长　钱三强
    苏联部长会议最近发表关于苏联第一个原子能工业电力站开始发电的公报，在这公报中指出苏联科学家和工程师已胜利地完成了苏联第一个原子能工业电力站的设计和建筑工作，这个电力站已于六月二十七日开始发电，供给附近地区的工业和农业的用途，发电能力为五千瓩；苏联科学家和工程师正在设计发电能力为五万到十万瓩的原子能工业电力站的工程。这是在人类历史上第一次把原子能用于工业生产，为今后人类使用新的动力方式的无限前途打下了基础。全世界爱好和平的人民、我国的劳动人民、我国的科学工作者听到这个消息异常兴奋，热烈地庆贺这个伟大的成就。
    自从十九世纪末法国的贝克莱尔发现放射性现象和居里夫妇发现镭以后，全世界爱好和平、想发掘自然的秘密、征服自然，为人类创造繁荣和幸福的科学工作者们不断努力，终于在一九四○年奠定了原子能应用的科学基础。但是这个伟大的发现立刻被美国帝国主义所霸占，利用它制造了原子武器，威胁全世界，造成国际紧张局势。和美国帝国主义相反，自从苏联掌握了原子能的科学规律以后，首先就利用了原子的爆炸为巨大的水利工程创造必要的条件，以后由于苏联掌握了各种类型的原子弹和氢弹，使得美国帝国主义不敢公然发动第三次世界大战；今天苏联又为原子能的和平的工业使用给全世界各国创造了优良的范例。
    为什么同样的一个科学发现，一个自然规律的掌握，在美国帝国主义手里就意味着战争威胁，国际的紧张局势，对被压迫的民族更加强烈的奴役，对科学工作者的迫害；反过来在苏联人民手里就表现着和平，人类美好将来的希望，国际紧张局势的缓和，被奴役人民的解放，科学的繁荣呢？
    我想这应该从社会制度的不同来解释。斯大林教导我们说，资本主义基本经济法则的主要特点和要求是：用剥削本国大多数居民并使他们破产和贫困的办法，用奴役和不断掠夺其他国家人民、特别是落后国家人民的办法，以及用旨在保证最高利润的战争和国民经济军事化的办法，来保证最大限度的资本主义利润。垄断资本主义的发动力是最大限度的利润，因此在第二次世界大战后，美国帝国主义紧紧握着原子弹，加强奴役和掠夺英、法、日、意的殖民地；加强对亚洲、非洲、南美洲和欧洲各国经济的侵略，在他们的土地上建立侵略的军事基地，逐渐使其中大多数国家变为附庸国；在朝鲜发动战争，在越南支持和逐渐代替法国帝国主义的反越南人民的战争；为保持所谓原子能秘密，制造无理法令，使得科学的成果不得交流，并且还无耻地捏造毫无根据的罪名杀死无辜的正义的罗森堡夫妇，最近更变本加厉地要迫害为他们自己制造第一批原子弹的科学家奥本海迈，用这类高压的手段，使得原子核物理不能充分的发展，同时使从事有关原子核工作的人们时刻地感到有生命的危险。总之，原子能的解放对于生产力的发展具有突变性的意义，应该给人类带来幸福，但是由于资本主义社会的基本性质，当它为美国帝国主义掌握时，给人类，给科学和科学工作者带来了灾害。
    斯大林又教导我们说，社会主义基本经济法则的主要特点和要求是：用在高度技术基础上使社会主义生产不断增长和不断完善的办法，来保证最大限度地满足整个社会经常增长的物质和文化的需要。这个基本法则很清楚地说明了苏联一贯的和平政策，因为只有世界和平，才有可能保证人民不断的经济和文化的发展。马林科夫在苏联共产党第十九次代表大会的报告中曾指出：“苏维埃国家虽然掌握了生产原子能的实际可能性，但亟愿把这种新型的能量用于和平目的，为人民谋幸福，因为这样利用原子能可以无限地扩展人类对自然界自发力量的控制，使人类有巨大的可能来提高生产力，在技术和文化上求进步，并增加社会财富。”
    最近苏联外交部长莫洛托夫一系列的外交活动，促进了国际紧张局势的缓和，使得被奴役的人民看到了解放的前途。苏联在战后的短短几年中，为了保卫社会主义祖国和世界和平的目的已先后发现了并掌握了原子武器的生产方法，现在又首先掌握了用原子能生产电力的方法，这无可辩驳地证明了苏联科学的突飞猛进，这种科学的迅速发展是和社会主义制度的无比优越性分不开的。原子能的解放应该给人类带来幸福，但是在不同社会制度下所产生的结果可以完全相反的，只有在社会主义的制度下，原子能才会用来保证最大限度地满足整个社会经常增长的物质和文化的需要。
    中国的科学工作者们从事实上已认识到苏联科学技术的高度水平，同时也认识到在主要科学部门已占居世界第一位的苏联的先进科学和苏联的社会主义社会制度的优越性是分不开的。今天苏联第一个将原子能使用于和平工业的光辉成就，更加增强了我们致力于祖国社会主义工业化建设的信心。我们将努力学习苏联的先进科学技术，学习苏联科学家为和平、为人民事业服务的精神，学习为苏联科学家已掌握的马克思列宁主义的方法论，并且将它应用到我们的实际工作中。只有这样，我们才能迅速地提高我国的科学技术水平，培养大量的青年科学技术人才，从而推动社会主义工业化建设迅速前进。
