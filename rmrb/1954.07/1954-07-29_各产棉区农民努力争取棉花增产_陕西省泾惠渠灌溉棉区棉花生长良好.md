Farmers in various cotton-producing areas are working hard to increase cotton production
Cotton grows well in the Jinghuiqu Irrigated Cotton Area of Shaanxi Province

Currently, Party and government leading organs in various cotton-producing areas are vigorously leading and guiding farmers to strengthen cotton field management to ensure the completion and strive for the over-completion of cotton production increase tasks. Liaoxi Province held a meeting of mayors and heads of major cotton-producing counties and cities to deploy tasks for saving cotton fields, and increased agricultural medicine loans by 14 billion yuan and distributed more than 40,000 sprayer parts to enhance pest control capabilities. The Secretary-General of the Provincial Government and responsible comrades from the Agricultural Department, along with more than 20 others, went to key cotton-producing areas to inspect and promote this work. Henan, Jiangsu and other places organized experts and cadres to go to cotton-producing areas in groups to assist farmers in pest control and weeding. Jiangxi, Hubei, Beijing and other provinces and cities also held cotton symposiums to study and discuss specific measures for increasing production, instructing various localities to implement them. In addition to sending cadres to focus on inspecting and leading farmers to strengthen field management, Hebei, Shanxi and other provinces have also studied and summarized late-stage management techniques for comprehensive promotion.

Under the leadership of cadres, farmers in various cotton-producing areas have enthusiastically launched various field management activities. More than 20,000 agricultural production cooperatives and hundreds of thousands of mutual aid teams in the cotton-producing areas of Hebei Province are leading farmers to timely add fertilizer and prune in more than 17 million mu of cotton fields. In Hongtong County, Shanxi Province, more than 2,200 people and more than 1,100 sprayers are dispatched daily to participate in pest control. Fifty-five agricultural production cooperatives and 150 mutual aid teams have purchased 150 sprayers and 4,000 jin of pesticides to eliminate pests, and have now treated more than 26,000 mu of cotton fields. Farmers in the Northeast region are engaged in an intense weeding campaign. Cotton fields in Liaoxi Province have completed two weedings and two soilings, and some have completed three rounds. Most cotton fields in Henan Province have been weeded three or four times, and the old cotton areas have generally carried out stripping lower leaves and fertilization. Farmers in major cotton-producing areas such as Jiangsu and Shandong provinces are also actively weeding, pruning, controlling pests and applying fast-acting fertilizers in cotton fields to promote good cotton growth. Cotton in some areas of Hubei, Jiangsu and other provinces that have suffered disasters has improved after strengthened management.

At present, cotton in areas such as Shandong, western and northern Henan, Shijiazhuang and Handan in Hebei, and southern Shanxi is generally growing well, generally more than one chi tall, with more than eight fruit branches, and some have begun to bloom and form bolls. Cotton in major cotton-producing counties in Sichuan Province is growing particularly vigorously, with cotton plants already about two chi tall, with more than ten fruit branches and ten to twenty flower buds per plant, most of which have blossomed and formed three or four bolls.

The 340,000-plus mu of cotton in the Jinghuiqu irrigation area, a major cotton-producing area in Shaanxi Province, is growing well after field management work such as pest control, pruning, topdressing, and irrigation. Generally, cotton plants are already more than one chi and two cun tall, with eight or nine layers of fruit branches, more than twenty flower buds, most of which have bloomed, and have formed three or four bolls. It is expected that new cotton can be picked in late August, about ten days earlier than in previous years.

When pests were found in the cotton fields, the Party and government leading organs in the irrigation area's counties made appropriate arrangements for the various important rural tasks at the time, calling on areas with severe pest infestations to prioritize pest control, and all other work must be postponed as appropriate. All cadres of the twelve agricultural technology promotion stations in the entire irrigation area went deep into the fields to check the pest situation and vigorously carry out technical instruction and guidance. The Guangji and Yongle agricultural technology promotion stations in Jingyang County, for example, instructed more than 470 grass-roots cadres in pest control, pruning and other techniques on a district basis; the Yanbei agricultural technology promotion station in Sanyuan County and the youth league branches of the nearby three townships signed a technical instruction contract, teaching more than 100 youth league members cotton field management techniques. To date, more than 35,000 mu of cotton fields in the entire irrigation area have been treated for blind stink bugs, with nearly 100,000 jin of pesticide powder supplied. Ten agricultural production cooperatives have all sprayed pesticides two to three times, and thirty-one key villages have also generally sprayed pesticides once.

In order to continue to do a good job in cotton field management after this rain and increase yields per unit area, the counties in the irrigation area will continue to mobilize cotton farmers to carry out cotton pruning, topping and pest control.

Guangdong Farmers Actively Eliminate Pests

Since late June, due to drought and little rain in some areas of Guangdong Province, seedlings have successively experienced varying degrees of pest damage. Now, party and government leading departments at all levels are mobilizing and organizing farmers to launch a pest elimination campaign.

After pest infestations occurred in various places, cadres in various places promoted mutual aid and cooperation organizations, using demonstrations, accounting, and physical exhibitions to mobilize farmers to promptly eliminate pests. On market day, the First Agricultural Production Cooperative of Zhongxi Township, Fifth District, Zengcheng County, used charts, physical objects, and news briefs to publicize to farmers. That evening, more than 1,400 people from eight townships in the district turned out, lighting more than 1,200 lamps in more than 10,000 mu of fields, trapping more than 70 jin of rice stem borers. Dongguan County established a pest elimination headquarters to be specifically responsible for leading pest elimination work. According to incomplete statistics from ten townships, an average of more than 80,000 people participated in pest elimination every day. The cooperative departments in some areas also promptly supplied farmers with pest control medicines and machinery. The Panyu County Cooperative General Society supplied more than 8,600 jin of insecticide powder and 87 sprayers in twelve days. At present, pest elimination work is continuing in various places.

    各产棉区农民努力争取棉花增产
    陕西省泾惠渠灌溉棉区棉花生长良好
    目前，各产棉区的党政领导机关，正大力领导和指导农民加强棉田管理，保证完成并力争超额完成棉花增产任务。辽西省召开了主要产棉县、市长会议，布置挽救棉田任务，并增加农药贷款一百四十亿元及发下喷雾器零件四万多件，以便增强防虫力量。省府秘书长和农业厅负责同志等二十余人，分赴重点棉区检查推动这一工作。河南、江苏等地组织了专家和干部多人，分组到产棉区协助农民进行治虫、锄草工作。江西、湖北、北京等省、市也召开了棉花座谈会，研究讨论出增产具体办法，指示各地推行。河北、山西等省除派出干部，重点检查和领导农民加强田间管理工作外，并研究总结后期管理技术，以便全面推广。
    各产棉区农民在干部领导下，热烈展开了各项田间管理活动。河北省产棉区的两万多个农业生产合作社和几十万个互助组，正带动农民在一千七百多万亩棉田中及时追加肥料和整枝打杈。山西省洪洞县参加治虫的，每天出动二千二百多人和一千一百多架喷雾器，五十五个农业生产合作社和一百五十个互助组，为消灭虫害，购买了一百五十架喷雾器和四千斤药剂，现已治虫二万六千多亩。东北区农民正投入紧张铲?热潮，辽西省棉田已完成二铲二?，有的完成了三遍。河南省大部棉田已锄过三、四遍，老棉区已普遍进行了脱裤腿和施肥。江苏、山东等省主要棉区农民，也都积极在棉田里锄草、整枝、治虫和加施速效肥料，促使棉花生长良好。湖北、江苏等省部分地区遭过灾害的棉花，经过加强管理后，生长已有好转。
    目前山东、江苏、河南的西部和北部，河北的石家庄及邯郸，山西南部等地区的棉花，大都生长良好，一般都有一尺多高，长出八个以上果枝，有的已开花结铃。四川主要产棉县的棉花，生长特别旺盛，棉株已高二尺左右，每株有十多个果枝和十至二十个花蕾，大部已开花，并结了三、四个铃。

    陕西省主要产棉地区泾惠渠灌溉区的三十四万余亩棉花，在进行防虫、整枝、追肥和灌溉等田间管理工作后，生长状况良好。一般棉株已高达一尺二寸以上，有八、九层果枝，二十多个花蕾，大部已放了花，结铃三、四个。预计到八月下旬就可采拾新棉，比往年提早约十天左右。
    当棉田中发现了虫害后，灌溉区各县党政领导机关即把当时农村各项重要工作作了适当安排，号召在虫害严重地区，以防虫工作为主，其他一切工作都必须酌情推迟。全灌溉地区的十二个农业技术推广站全体干部都深入田间，检查虫情，大力展开技术传授和指导工作。泾阳县的广吉、永乐等农业技术推广站，曾以区为单位向四百七十多名基层干部传授了防虫、整枝等技术；三原县雁北农业技术推广站和附近三个乡的青年团支部订立了技术传授合同，向一百多名青年团员讲授了棉田管理技术。到目前为止，全灌溉区棉田中防治过盲椿象的面积有三万五千多亩，供应药粉近十万斤。十个农业生产合作社已全部喷药二至三次，三十一个重点村也已普遍喷药一次。
    为继续做好这次雨后的棉田管理工作，提高单位面积产量，灌溉区各县将继续发动棉农进行棉花的整枝、打杈和防虫工作。广东省农民积极除虫
    六月下旬以来，广东省部分地区因天旱雨少，秧苗陆续发生了不同程度的虫害。现在各级党、政领导部门，正动员和组织农民开展除虫运动。
    各地虫害发生后，各地干部推动互助合作组织，用示范、算账、实物展览会等多种方式方法，发动农民及时扑灭虫害。增城县第五区中西乡第一农业生产合作社在集日那天，用挂图、实物、快报等向农民宣传，该区八个乡农民当晚就有一千四百多人出动，在一万多亩田上点灯一千二百余盏，诱杀了螟蛾七十余斤。东莞县成立除虫指挥部，专门负责领导除虫工作，据十个乡不完全统计，平均每天有八万多人参加除虫。有的地区的合作部门，更及时供应农民除虫药械，番禺县合作总社在十二天内便供应了杀虫粉八千六百多斤，喷雾器八十七架。目前，各地除虫工作正在继续进行。（黄振中）
