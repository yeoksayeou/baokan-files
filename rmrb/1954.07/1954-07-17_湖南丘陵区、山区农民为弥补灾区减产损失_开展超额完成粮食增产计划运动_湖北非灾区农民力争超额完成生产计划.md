Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 16th: Farmers in the vast hilly and mountainous areas of Hunan Province are launching a campaign to strive for exceeding this year's grain production plan. Most counties and districts in the hilly and mountainous areas have further explored production potential at recent farmer representative meetings and mutual aid and cooperation representative meetings, and revised the original production increase plans, appropriately increasing the production increase targets. The first agricultural production cooperative in Shangtian Township, Xinhua County, issued a challenge to farmers in the Shaoyang area, setting a target of increasing production by another fifty catties of grain per mu. Farmers in the Fourth District of Xiangtan County plan to expand the area of late rice by more than 11,000 mu to ensure excess production. The farmers in the entire district have now rushed to repair 76 water conservancy projects. In Chaling County, more than 70,000 farmers have invested in summer fertilizer accumulation, preparing to plant another season of grain crops.

Since the beginning of summer this year, the areas along the river and lake in Hunan Province and some mountainous areas have suffered from waterlogging and flash floods due to excessive rainfall. In order to compensate for the losses in production in the disaster areas, the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China instructed party committees at all levels in the hilly and mountainous areas on July 5 to immediately lead farmers to launch a campaign to increase grain production beyond quotas, requiring efforts to increase rice or miscellaneous grain production by another thirty to forty catties, fifty to sixty catties, or even one to two hundred catties per mu on the basis of the original production increase plan. The main methods for increasing grain production beyond quotas are: in addition to strengthening field management of existing grain crops to ensure a bumper harvest, it is also necessary to strive to "use one mu of land as two mu of land," and plant another season of rice or miscellaneous grains. In order to strengthen the leadership of this movement, the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has transferred a group of cadres to establish an agricultural production increase office. The Hunan Provincial People's Government Grain Department, Agriculture and Forestry Department, and Supply and Marketing Cooperative are also vigorously raising late rice and miscellaneous grain seeds to supply farmers in a timely manner.

The cultivated land area in the hilly and mountainous areas of Hunan Province is more than 40 million mu, accounting for about 72 percent of the province's cultivated land area. The hilly and mountainous areas have a mild climate and abundant rainfall, and most of the cultivated land is suitable for planting two crops a year (planting double-season rice or middle-season rice, and then planting autumn and winter miscellaneous grain crops after harvesting). Since liberation, many ponds, dams, and small reservoirs have been built in these areas, which has improved irrigation efficiency. In addition, with the development of mutual aid and cooperation organizations, the area for planting two crops a year has gradually expanded. This year, these areas have further developed farmland water conservancy, and more than half of the farmers have participated in mutual aid and cooperation organizations, creating favorable conditions for planting another season of crops to increase grain production beyond quotas.

According to Xinhua News Agency: In Hubei Province, with the exception of some areas affected by waterlogging disasters, the vast number of farmers, driven by mutual aid and cooperation organizations, are adopting methods such as processing and cultivating seedlings and planting more to harvest more, striving to exceed this year's agricultural production plan.

In order to increase the production of more grain, cotton, etc. to support the country's socialist industrialization, and to compensate for the losses caused by the disaster, the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Hubei Provincial People's Government recently issued emergency instructions, requiring party and government leading organs in various places to lead farmers to fully tap production potential and increase production by another 2.5 percent on the basis of the original plan, which was 9.3 percent higher than last year. In implementing this instruction, various localities have successively convened expanded cadre meetings at the district and township levels, representative meetings of mutual aid and cooperation organizations, etc., criticizing the unfounded conservative thinking of lacking confidence and the complacent thinking of being blindly optimistic and thinking there are no problems, and found ways to increase production. Farmers who were not accustomed to applying top dressing in the past have now applied top dressing, and in many areas cotton has begun to be pruned and branched, and rice has been weeded two or three times. Farmers in rice-producing areas are also preparing to expand the area of double-season rice and regenerated rice according to local conditions, and strive to harvest one more season. The area for planting double-season rice in the sixteen counties of Xiaogan Prefecture this year has been expanded from the original plan of 2.6 million mu to more than 2.98 million mu. In Xishui County, the area of regenerated rice this year will account for 60 percent of the total paddy field area, an expansion of 20 percent compared with last year, and the yield per mu is also required to increase by 20 percent compared with last year. Enshi Prefecture plans to strive to plant another season this year and harvest more than 45 million catties of rice. Farmers in mountainous areas are also striving for a bumper harvest of miscellaneous grains in accordance with local conditions.

### 湖南丘陵区、山区农民为弥补灾区减产损失  开展超额完成粮食增产计划运动  湖北非灾区农民力争超额完成生产计划

    湖南丘陵区、山区农民为弥补灾区减产损失
    开展超额完成粮食增产计划运动
    湖北非灾区农民力争超额完成生产计划
    【新华社长沙十六日电】湖南省广大丘陵区和山区农民，正在开展争取超额完成今年粮食增产计划的运动。丘陵区和山区的大部分县、区，已在最近召开的农民代表会议和互助合作代表会议上，进一步挖掘了生产潜力，修订原来的增产计划，把增产指标适当提高。新化县上田乡第一农业生产合作社订出每亩再增产五十斤粮食的计划，向邵阳专区农民发起挑战竞赛。湘潭县第四区农民计划扩大晚稻面积一万一千多亩，保证超额增产。现在全区农民已突击修好了七十六处水利工程。茶陵县已有七万多农民投入夏季积肥，准备多种一季粮食作物。
    今年入夏以来，湖南省沿江滨湖地区和部分山区因雨水过多，遭受内涝和山洪灾害。为了弥补灾区减产的损失，中共湖南省委员会在七月五日指示丘陵区和山区的各级党委立即领导农民开展一个超额增产粮食的运动，要求在原订增产计划的基础上，争取每亩再增产稻谷或杂粮三四十斤、五六十斤以至一两百斤。超额增产粮食的主要办法是：除了加强对现有粮食作物的田间管理以保证丰收外，还必须努力做到“一亩田当两亩田用”，多种一季水稻或杂粮。为了加强对这一运动的领导，中共湖南省委员会已抽调一批干部成立农业增产办公室。湖南省人民政府粮食厅、农林厅和供销合作部门也正在大力筹集晚稻和杂粮种籽，以及时供应农民。
    湖南省丘陵区和山区的耕地面积有四千多万亩，约占全省耕地面积百分之七十二。丘陵区和山区气候温和，雨量充足，绝大部分耕地适宜一年种植两季作物（种双季稻或是种中稻，收割后再种秋、冬杂粮作物）。解放后这些地区兴修了许多塘、坝和小型水库，提高了灌溉效能，再加上互助合作组织的发展，一年种植两季作物的面积就逐渐扩大。今年这些地区进一步发展农田水利，并已有半数以上的农民参加互助合作组织，给多种一季作物以超额增产粮食创造了有利条件。
    据新华社讯：湖北省除部分受积水灾害地区外，广大农民在互助合作组织的带动下，采用加工培育禾苗、多种多收等办法，争取超额完成今年的农业生产计划。
    为了增产更多的粮食、棉花等支援国家的社会主义工业化，并弥补因灾所受的损失，中共湖北省委员会和湖北省人民政府日前曾发出紧急指示，要求各地党、政领导机关领导农民充分挖掘生产潜力，在原订比去年增产百分之九点三的计划的基础上，再增产百分之二点五。在贯彻这一指示中，各地纷纷召开区、乡扩大干部会、互助合作组织代表会等会议，批判了毫无根据地缺乏信心的保守思想和盲目乐观认为无问题的自满思想，找出了增产的门路。过去不习惯施用追肥的农民，现在很多已施了追肥，不少地区棉花已开始整枝打杈，水稻已薅草两三道。水稻产区农民还根据当地条件，准备扩大种植双季稻和再生稻的面积，争取多收一季。孝感专区的十六个县今年种双季稻的面积，从原计划二百六十万亩扩大到二百九十八万多亩。浠水县今年再生稻面积将占全部水田面积的百分之六十，比去年扩大百分之二十，每亩产量也要求比去年提高二成。恩施专区计划争取今年多种一季，多收稻谷四千五百多万斤。山区农民也因地制宜地争取杂粮丰收。
