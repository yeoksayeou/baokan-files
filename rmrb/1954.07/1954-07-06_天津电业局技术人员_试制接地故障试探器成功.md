Technicians at the Tianjin Electric Power Bureau
Successfully Trial-Produce Ground Fault Detector
    According to advanced Soviet experience, technicians in the power supply department of the Tianjin Electric Power Bureau have successfully trial-produced a "ground fault detector." After testing, this equipment can find the faulty line within 0.9 seconds, allowing for timely repairs.
    Grounding faults in high-voltage lines are a common type of line fault in the electric power sector. In the past, when such accidents occurred, it was impossible to determine which line had a grounding fault among the many lines. Therefore, the only method was to cut power to each line for testing. Each power outage took about two minutes, causing production interruptions, reduced output, defective products, or scrap in many factories on that line. Factories with continuous production requirements would experience disruption of production processes or damage to equipment. In addition, sudden power outages and restorations would cause serious damage to the factory's electrical equipment. These situations can be completely avoided by using the "ground fault detector."
    Currently, technicians at the Tianjin Electric Power Bureau are preparing to convert the "high-voltage clamp meter" into a "high-voltage grounding clamp meter." With this equipment, they can find the faulty line without interrupting power at all. These improvements are of great significance for ensuring a safe power supply.

    天津电业局技术人员
    试制接地故障试探器成功
    天津电业局供电部门技术人员，根据苏联先进经验，试制“接地故障试探器”已获成功。经过试验，用这种设备，只要零点九秒的时间，就能找到那一条线路发生接地故障，及时进行检修。
    高压线路接地，是电业部门容易发生的线路故障。过去，这种事故发生后，在许多线路中，一时无法判明是那一条线路发生了接地故障，因此只能采取逐条停电进行试验的办法。每条线路停电一次约需两分钟，就给这条线路上的许多工厂造成生产间断、减产、出次品或废品的事故。有些生产不能间断的工厂，还会破坏生产程序或损坏设备。另外，由于突然停止供电和突然恢复供电，对工厂的电器设备也有严重的危害。使用“接地故障试探器”后，这些情况可以完全避免。
    目前，天津电业局的技术人员们又准备将“高压卡表”改成“高压接地卡表”，利用这种设备可以一点不停电，就能找到那一条线路发生了故障。这些改进，对保证安全供电是有重大的意义的。
