(Xinhua News Agency, July 3rd) TASS, New York, July 2nd: San Salvador dispatch: Guatemalan military government head Monson and interventionist head Castillo Armas have reached an agreement. According to this agreement, Monson will be President of Guatemala for at least fifteen days. This agreement was reached early on the morning of the 2nd at the Presidential Palace in El Salvador with the participation of the U.S. Ambassador to Guatemala, who, according to the reporter covering this story, was present in the capacity of "advisor."

The agreement stipulates the establishment of a government headed by Monson, including Castillo Armas and Colonel Diaz, the leader of the first military government that took power after the overthrow of President Arbenz.

According to a report from Guatemala City, workers and peasants in various parts of Guatemala have risen up to oppose the military government. Reporters reported that the Guatemalan military and police "admitted that they do not have enough reserves" to suppress these uprisings.

It is reported that the situation in the Esquintla region is particularly serious for the military government's forces, where armed guerrillas led by Pelece, one of the leaders of the Guatemalan Labor Party, are active. The military government has sent most of its reserves (including two tanks) here.

    蒙松与干涉军头子阿马斯在美国参与下协议建立军政府
    危地马拉各地工农群众纷纷起义进行反抗
    【新华社三日讯】塔斯社纽约二日讯：圣萨尔瓦多消息，危地马拉军政府首脑蒙松和干涉军首脑卡斯蒂略·阿马斯已达成一项协定，根据这项协定，蒙松至少将当十五天危地马拉总统。这项协定是二日清早在萨尔瓦多总统府在美国驻危地马拉大使的参与下达成的，按照报道这条消息的记者的说法，这位大使是以“顾问”的身份出面的。
    协定规定建立一个以蒙松为首的包括卡斯蒂略·阿马斯和迪亚斯上校三人组成的政府，迪亚斯是推翻了阿本斯总统之后第一个上台的军政府的领导者。
    据危地马拉城消息，危地马拉各地工农群众纷纷起义反对军政府。记者报道，危地马拉军方和警察“承认，他们没有足够的后备队”来镇压这些起义。
    据悉，艾斯奎特拉区的情况对军政府的军队特别严重，这里有危地马拉劳动党的领袖之一佩莱塞所领导的武装游击队在活动。军政府已把大部分的后备队（包括两辆坦克）都派到这里来了。
