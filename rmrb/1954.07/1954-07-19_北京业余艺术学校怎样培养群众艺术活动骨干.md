How the Beijing Amateur Art School Cultivates Backbone Personnel for Mass Art Activities
Cao Feiya

Since its establishment in 1950, the Beijing Amateur Art School has trained more than 8,700 backbone personnel in mass art activities in literature, drama, music, fine arts, dance, and opera, greatly promoting mass art activities in the capital. The training targets of the Amateur Art School are mainly the backbone of literary and artistic activities in factories and mines, as well as cultural center cadres and suburban farmers. The school has five departments: drama, music, fine arts, dance, and literature, each with primary and intermediate classes. Many trade unions in factories and mines in the capital, in order to carry out literary and artistic activities in their units, recommended the most outstanding employees who were backbone personnel in artistic activities to study at the school. These students love art and mass amateur art activities. After enrolling, they generally demand strictness of themselves and diligently study various artistic knowledge. Many people, in order not to miss the opportunity to study, often braved the wind and rain to come to the city from the suburbs for classes. When farmer classes were opened in rural areas, many farmer art activity backbone members also actively participated in the study.

However, the Beijing Amateur Art School is a new type of school. How to explore a set of scientific and systematic teaching methods and organizational methods based on the characteristics of amateur activities; how to better arrange teaching content, there is still a lack of mature experience. After four years of efforts, the Beijing Amateur Art School has the following experiences in this regard:

First, in teaching, it is necessary to master the principle of "combining theory with practice, emphasizing both teaching and guidance, and achieving learning by doing." For example, in the drama department, after teaching courses such as directing, acting, makeup, and script analysis, students urgently wanted to know specific methods such as how to direct, how to act, and how to apply makeup. In order to meet their requirements, they were divided into groups according to their different artistic levels for rehearsals, and specific guidance was given through rehearsals. Sometimes, internship performances were also organized to exercise the students' ability to direct, perform, and apply makeup. This practice of combining theory with practice shortens the distance between theory and practice and consolidates learning outcomes. At the same time, they adopted the method of focusing on in-depth guidance in factories to help students carry out amateur art activities in their units and improve their artistic practice ability.

In order to expand the scope of learning and broaden the horizons of the students, the school leaders often organize various art observation meetings and exhibitions in a planned way, especially paying attention to learning various arts from the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries. These studies have played a supporting role in the entire teaching work.

Second, carry out creative activities through teaching. Creative activity is the main force in promoting mass art activities. Among the workers and masses of various factories and mines in Beijing, there are many talented writers and artists. They have rich lives and imaginations. In the past few years, the Beijing Amateur Art School has helped students create according to their different literary and artistic specialties in the practice of teaching, producing some works that are more popular among the masses. Some students have also written a lot of storytelling materials, especially the students' creation of cartoons and comic strips, which have been well received by the majority of workers in factories and mines. For example, in the "Three-Anti" movement in the Beijing People's Printing Factory and the Beijing Trolleybus Repair and Manufacturing South Factory, the relevant works created by the students of the Beijing Amateur Art School and the members of their unit's art team played a great role in publicity and mobilization. In addition to adopting regular individual assistance methods for writers with promising development prospects, the school also introduces them to the Beijing Federation of Literary and Art Workers or establishes contact with professional writers so that they can receive long-term training opportunities. This approach is beneficial to the continued improvement of the level of amateur writers.

Third, adopt the method of mobile teaching to send art to factories and mines. Most of the larger factories in Beijing are in the suburbs, but due to traffic and time constraints, they cannot come to the city for classes, so many active members of art activities do not have the opportunity to study. In response to this situation, in addition to opening classes in the city, the Beijing Amateur Art School also extracts a certain amount of strength and adopts the method of mobile teaching to run art training classes in suburban factories and mining areas. From May to September 1953, drama, music, dance, and fine arts classes were opened in the Changxindian Railway Factory and the Mentougou Mining Area. The characteristic of this mobile teaching is to concentrate efforts, conduct short-term intensive training, and enable students to master general artistic knowledge through teaching, and help students organize or improve various art groups in their units. After the study is over, the school and these factories and mines still maintain regular contact and strengthen guidance work to consolidate the teaching results.

Fourth, open farmer classes. With the increasing development of the rural mutual aid and cooperation movement and the improvement of economic life, farmers' demands for cultural life are more urgent than at any time in the past. In order to make rural amateur art activities widespread and improved, the Beijing Amateur Art School chose Nanyuan and Haidian districts as pilot projects in February 1953 to open farmer art training classes and conduct training in basic art knowledge. More than 620 farmer art activity backbone members from 61 village theater troupes participated in this study. In January of this year, key guidance was conducted in Nanyuan District. After studying, music and dance activities in Nanyuan and Haidian districts have gradually developed, and the level of drama performances has also improved.

The training classes opened in rural areas must pay attention to seasonality; at the same time, it is not appropriate to adopt the method of giving large classes and lectures, and necessary drama and music common sense education should be carried out in conjunction with rehearsing plays and teaching songs.

Fifth, strengthen organizational leadership and cultivate teaching talents. Organizing social forces in a planned way to serve the teaching of amateur art education is an important part of teaching work. There are many professional art groups in the capital, and there are also many writers and artists who are enthusiastic about guiding mass art activities. In the past few years, the Beijing Amateur Art School has become a bridge connecting these professional art workers and the backbone of mass art activities, organizing and using this force to undertake teaching work. In addition, they also paid attention to learning and excavating folk art, and organized folk artists in a planned way to undertake teaching work.

Since cultivating backbone personnel for mass art activities is a very important task, it is necessary to do a good job in organizational work so that backbone personnel for mass art activities can get the opportunity to study. In order to carefully select students, before each semester begins, the school and the Propaganda Department of the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions jointly conducted serious and meticulous research, and absorbed outstanding students to study at the school through examinations and universal care.

Amateur art teaching work needs to be continuously improved in order to become a specialized teaching career. Therefore, in addition to organizing professional art workers to participate in teaching, the school also plans to train full-time teachers, strengthen the professional study of current professional cadres, and gradually improve the quality of teaching.

Sixth, at present, there is still a lack of a relatively complete set of textbooks for amateur art education in various places. Therefore, sorting out and editing amateur art textbooks is an important task and a good way to accumulate experience and promote experience; at the same time, it can also lay the foundation for future teaching work. In the process of carrying out teaching work, the Beijing Amateur Art School carefully sorted out and studied each textbook in detail, and compiled and printed some textbooks as a reference for future teaching work. In order to establish contact with various places and exchange experiences with each other, it also compiled and printed "Amateur Art Newsletter."

    北京业余艺术学校怎样培养群众艺术活动骨干
    曹菲亚
    北京业余艺术学校从一九五○年创办以来的四年中，陆续培养了文学、戏剧、音乐、美术、舞蹈、戏曲等群众艺术活动骨干八千七百多人，大大地推动了首都的群众艺术活动。业余艺术学校的培养对象，主要的是厂矿企业中的文艺活动骨干，以及文化馆干部和郊区农民。学校里设立戏剧、音乐、美术、舞蹈、文学五个系，每系各设初级和中级两班。首都很多厂矿的工会，为了开展本单位的文艺活动，把最优秀的职工艺术活动骨干保送到该校学习。这些学员热爱艺术，热爱群众业余艺术活动，他们入学后，一般都能严格地要求自己，认真钻研各种艺术知识。好些人为了不失掉学习的机会，常常冒着风雨从郊区赶到城内来上课。在农村中开办农民班时，很多农民艺术活动骨干分子，也积极地参加了学习。
    但是，北京业余艺术学校是个新型的学校。如何根据业余的特点，摸索出一套科学而系统的教学方法与组织方法；如何更好地安排教课内容，现在还缺乏成熟的经验。北京业余艺术学校经过四年来的努力，在这方面有以下几点体会：
    一、在教学上必须掌握“理论与实践相结合，教学与辅导并重，做到边学边用”的原则。比如戏剧系，讲授了导演、表演、化装、剧本分析等课程后，学员便迫切地要求知道怎样导演、怎样表演、怎样化装等具体做法。为了满足他们的要求，根据学员不同的艺术水平，分成小组，进行排练，通过排练给予具体指导，有时也组织实习演出，锻练学员导演、表演与化装的能力。这种理论结合实际的做法，缩短理论与实践之间的距离，巩固了学习成果。同时，他们又采取重点深入工厂进行辅导的办法，帮助学员开展本单位的业余艺术活动，提高学员的艺术实践能力。
    为了扩大学习范围，扩大学员们的眼界，学校领导方面经常有计划地组织各种艺术观摩会、展览会，尤其注意学习苏联及人民民主国家的各种艺术。这些学习，对于整个教学工作都起了辅助作用。
      二、通过教学开展创作活动。创作活动是推动群众艺术活动的主要力量。在北京市各厂矿职工群众中，蕴藏着不少富有天才的写作者和艺术人才。他们有着丰富的生活和想像力。几年来，北京业余艺术学校在教学的实习中，帮助学员根据不同的文艺特长进行创作，产生了一些比较为群众欢迎的作品。还有一部分学员写出了不少的说唱材料，特别是学员们的漫画与连环画的创作，在厂矿中，得到了广大职工的好评。如北京人民印刷厂和北京电车修造南厂，在“三反”运动中，北京业余艺术学校学员与他们本单位美术组员创作出来的有关作品，便起了很大的宣传与鼓动作用。学校对于那些有培养前途的写作者，除采用经常的个别帮助方式外，并把他们介绍给北京市文学艺术工作者联合会，或与专业作家取得联系，使其能得到长期培养的机会。这种做法，对于继续提高业余写作者的水平，是有好处的。
    三、采用巡回教学法，把艺术送到厂矿中去。北京市规模较大的工厂，大多在郊区，但是由于交通与时间的限制，不能来市内上课，因此很多艺术活动积极分子，得不到学习的机会。针对这种情况，北京业余艺术学校除在城内开班外，并抽出一定力量，采用巡回教学法，把艺术学习班办到郊区工厂、矿区中去。一九五三年五月至九月，前后在长辛店铁路工厂与门头沟矿区，分别开了戏剧、音乐、舞蹈、美术四个班。这种巡回教学的特点，是集中力量，短期集训，通过教学使学员掌握一般的艺术知识，并帮助学员组织或健全本单位各种艺术小组。学习结束后，学校和这些厂矿仍然保持经常的联系，加强辅导工作，使教学成果巩固下来。
    四、开办农民班。随着农村互助合作运动的日益发展和经济生活的提高，农民对文化生活的要求，比过去任何时期都要迫切。为使农村业余艺术活动普遍开展和提高，北京业余艺术学校在一九五三年二月间，曾选择南苑、海淀两区作为试点，开办农民艺术训练班，进行艺术基本知识的训练。参加这次学习的有六十一个村剧团的六百二十多个农民艺术活动骨干。今年一月，又在南苑区进行重点辅导。经过学习后，南苑、海淀两区的音乐、舞蹈活动已逐渐开展，戏剧的演出水平也有了提高。
    在农村中开办的训练班，必须注意季节性；同时，不宜采用上大课、讲理论的方式，应该结合排戏、教歌，进行必要的戏剧与音乐常识的教育。
    五、加强组织领导，培养教学人才。有计划地组织社会力量为业余艺术教育的教学服务，是教学工作的重要一环。首都有很多专业文艺团体，也有很多热心于辅导群众文艺活动的作家、艺术家。几年来，北京业余艺术学校便成为这些专业文艺工作者和广大群众艺术活动骨干联系的桥梁，组织与运用了这一力量来担任教学工作。此外，他们还注意了学习与发掘民间艺术，并有计划地组织民间艺人，担任教学工作。
    培养群众艺术活动骨干，既然是很重要的工作，那就必须做好组织工作，使群众艺术活动骨干能得到学习的机会。为了慎重地选拔学员，每在开学前，学校和北京市总工会宣传部共同作了认真、细致的研究，并通过考试与普遍照顾等方式，吸收优秀学员到学校学习。
    业余艺术教学工作，要成为一种专门的教学事业，需要不断地改进。因此除组织专业文艺工作者参加教学外，学校还有计划地培养专职教员，加强现任专业干部的业务学习，逐步地提高教学质量。
    六、目前，各地还缺乏一套比较完整的业余艺术教育的教材。因之，整理与编辑业余艺术教材，是一件重要的工作，也是积累经验、推广经验的好办法；同时还能为以后的教学工作打下基础。北京业余艺术学校在进行教学工作的过程中，认真地对每一种教材进行了细致的整理与研究，并把部分教材加以编印，作为今后教学工作的参考。为了与各地取得联系，互相交流经验，并编印了“业余艺术通讯”。
