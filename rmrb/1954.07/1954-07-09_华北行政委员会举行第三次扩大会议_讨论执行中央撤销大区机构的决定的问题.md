Xinhua News Agency, July 8th: The North China Administrative Committee held its third enlarged meeting on July 5th and 6th to discuss how to implement the Central People's Government's decision to abolish regional-level administrative organizations. Liu Lantao, Chairman of the North China Administrative Committee, gave a report conveying the significance of abolishing regional-level administrative organizations. Vice Chairman Zhang Su delivered a report on the main work situation in the North China region and the conclusion of the work of the North China Administrative Committee. In his report, Zhang Su pointed out that in 1953, under the correct leadership of the Central People's Government, the entire North China region, through the unremitting efforts of all the people and cadres at all levels, victoriously completed the various tasks assigned by the state. The various tasks in the first half of 1954 have seen even greater development. Industrial production from January to June is expected to complete 52 percent of the annual plan. In terms of capital construction, a construction area of 2.07 million square meters has been completed, accounting for 37 percent of the annual construction task. Agricultural production has completed the sowing task in a timely manner, and the region's cotton planting task exceeded the original plan by 9 percent. Wheat production has generally increased, with an average yield per mu increasing by 12 jin compared to 1953. The mutual aid and cooperation movement has seen significant development, with the number of agricultural production cooperatives in the region increasing from more than 6,000 in 1953 to more than 42,000. Other tasks have also achieved certain results. However, there are still some problems and shortcomings in the current work, which must be further examined and improved in accordance with the spirit of the overall national task. The report concluded with an explanation of the steps and specific arrangements for the conclusion of the work of the North China Administrative Committee.

Among those who spoke during the meeting's discussions were Liu Xiufeng and Li Zhuchen, Vice Chairmen of the North China Administrative Committee, and committee members Lin Tie, Deng Chumin, Zhang Youyu, Zhou Shutao, Dong Qiwu, Pei Lisheng, Shu Sheyu, Wang Baozhen, and Wang Yunsheng. In their speeches, everyone unanimously agreed that the Central People's Government's decision to abolish regional-level administrative organizations was correct and timely, and expressed their full support. They expressed their agreement with the reports of Liu Lantao and Zhang Su. The meeting also conducted detailed discussions on industrial production, urban construction, the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement, and the consolidation of primary and secondary education.

Finally, Liu Lantao gave a summary, emphasizing in the summary that future work must: First, focus on leading industrial production and capital construction, especially the construction of 141 major enterprises in North China, as only in this way can we guarantee the smooth realization of the country's first five-year plan; Second, continue to focus on arranging the market and strengthening leadership over commercial work, so that the entire market is placed under the leadership of socialist economic forces, in order to gradually carry out the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce; The policy of planned purchase and planned supply of food is completely correct, and the work has been successful, but our experience is still very insufficient, and we must continue to create and accumulate experience to do this work even better; Third, strengthen the leadership of agricultural production cooperatives, credit cooperatives, and supply and marketing cooperatives, consider and formulate new development plans based on the current situation, in order to gradually enhance the socialist factors in agriculture and restrict the development of capitalist factors in rural areas; Fourth, expand and deepen the publicity and discussion of the draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China, hold county, city, and provincial people's congress meetings on schedule, and consolidate and expand the people's democratic united front; Fifth, focus on the training and education of cadres, especially in the enterprise sector, where the political and ideological work of cadres should be regarded as an important task, and criticism and self-criticism should be carried out regularly to overcome complacency and arrogance, in order to enhance unity and improve work. Liu Lantao finally pointed out that the North China-level cadres will be transferred to new jobs in batches in the next two months, and every comrade should proceed from the interests of the country and the people, avoid arrogance and impetuosity, and treat the new work with caution and humility.

The meeting demanded that the conclusion of work be treated as a serious political task and meticulous organizational work. The various units of the North China Administrative Committee will transfer work in batches according to the work situation in a planned manner, so that the work of various provinces and cities and the central departments can be closely connected.

    华北行政委员会举行第三次扩大会议
    讨论执行中央撤销大区机构的决定的问题
    【新华社八日讯】华北行政委员会在七月五日、六日召开第三次扩大会议，讨论如何执行中央人民政府关于撤销大区一级行政机构的决定的问题。华北行政委员会主席刘澜涛就撤销大区一级行政机构的意义作了传达报告，副主席张苏作了关于华北区的主要工作情况与华北行政委员会结束工作的报告。张苏在报告中指出：一九五三年华北全区在中央人民政府的正确领导下，经过全体人民和各级干部坚持不懈的努力，胜利地完成了国家所给予的各项任务。一九五四年上半年的各项工作有了更大的发展，工业生产一至六月份预计可完成全年计划的百分之五十二；基本建设方面已完成建筑面积二百零七万平方公尺，占全年建筑任务的百分之三十七；农业生产已适时完成播种任务，全区植棉任务超过原计划百分之九；小麦普遍增产，平均每亩产量比一九五三年提高十二斤；互助合作运动有了巨大发展，全区农业生产合作社已由一九五三年的六千多个发展到四万二千多个。其他各项工作也都取得了一定成绩。但目前工作中仍存在着若干问题和缺点，必须根据国家总任务的精神继续深入检查，力求改进。报告最后就华北行政委员会结束工作的步骤和具体安排做了说明。
    会议讨论中发言的有华北行政委员会副主席刘秀峰、李烛尘，委员林铁、邓初民、张友渔、周叔弢、董其武、裴丽生、舒舍予、王葆真、王芸生等。大家在发言中一致认为中央人民政府关于撤销大区一级行政机构的决定是正确的、适时的，表示完全拥护。对刘澜涛、张苏的报告表示同意。会议并就工业生产、城市建设、农业互助合作运动、整顿中小学教育等工作，进行了详尽的讨论。
    最后，刘澜涛作了总结，在总结中着重指出今后工作必须：第一、抓紧工业生产和基本建设的领导，特别是要抓紧一百四十一项巨大企业在华北的建设工程的领导，只有这样，才能保证国家第一个五年计划的顺利实现；第二、继续抓紧安排市场，加强对商业工作的领导，使整个市场放在社会主义经济力量领导之下，以便逐步地进行对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造；关于粮食的计划收购和计划供应的方针是完全正确的，工作是有成绩的，但我们的经验还很不够，必须继续创造和积累经验，把这一工作做得更好；第三、加强对农业生产合作社、信用合作社、供销合作社的领导，依据目前情况，考虑和制定新的发展计划，以逐步增强农业的社会主义因素，限制资本主义因素在农村中发展；第四、扩大和深入中华人民共和国宪法草案的宣传和讨论工作，按期开好县、市、省的人民代表大会会议，巩固和扩大人民民主统一战线；第五、抓紧干部的培养教育，特别在企业部门要把干部的政治思想工作当作重要任务，经常开展批评和自我批评，克服骄傲自满情绪，以增强团结，改进工作。刘澜涛最后指出，华北一级干部在今后两个月内，将分批转向新的工作岗位，每个同志都应从国家和人民的利益出发，戒骄戒躁，谨慎谦虚地对待新的工作。
    会议要求把结束工作当作一项严肃的政治任务和细致的组织工作去做。华北行政委员会各单位将依据工作情况，有计划地分批移交，使各省市和中央各部门的工作紧密衔接起来。
