In Sichuan Province, one hundred and twenty-seven cities and counties, including Chengdu and Jiangjin, have elected the most outstanding figures from all walks of life as deputies to the local People's Congresses. Twelve cities and counties, including Luzhou and Xinfan, are in the process of electing people's representatives. In accordance with the provisions of the Electoral Law, each city and county has jointly nominated a list of representative candidates by the Chinese Communist Party and local people's organizations, and elections have been conducted after careful discussions at the people's representative conferences at the grassroots level. Many Communist Party members who are loved by the people, as well as outstanding figures among workers and peasants, have been elected as city and county people's representatives in this election. Hao Deqing, Secretary of the Chengdu Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and Yuan Zhuang, Secretary of the Leshan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, have both been elected as representatives. Among the more than 940 county people's representatives in Jintang, Pixian and other three counties, more than 250 are representatives of workers and peasants. Among the peasant representatives in Pixian and Mianyang counties, 125 are chairmen of agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams. Among those elected as people's representatives are Yuan Zhixian, Chengdu's special-class labor model who actively studied advanced Soviet experience and increased work efficiency by two to four times, Du Qiaozhen, a female worker in Leshan County with 27 years of experience who has been named a labor model three times, Tang Tianxiu (female), a Sichuan provincial agricultural labor model and chairman of the Changjiang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Deyang County, and Zeng Yilong, chairman of the first agricultural production cooperative in the suburbs of Wutongqiao City, and other advanced figures on the production front.

The families of heroes of the Chinese People's Volunteers are also supported and loved by the people. Deng Fangzhi, the mother of Huang Jiguang, a special-class hero of the Volunteers, Huang Zaiting, the father of Huang Jiafu, a first-class blasting hero of the Volunteers, Guo Lanying, the wife of Gao Lianglun, a special-class meritorious and second-class hero of the Volunteers, and Lai Shengyuan, the father of Lai Yongze, a second-class hero of the Volunteers, have all been elected as county people's representatives. Among the elected representatives are also Ke Zhao, Vice Dean of Sichuan University, Chen Xubin, an excellent pediatrician, and Ci Qing, a director of the Buddhist Association of China and chairman of the Chengdu Buddhist Study Committee, and other representatives from all walks of life. Among the more than 940 representatives in Jintang, Pixian and other three counties, there are 167 female representatives, and ethnic minorities also have appropriate quotas of representatives.

At present, the people's representatives of each city and county are widely soliciting proposals from voters through people's representative conferences at the grassroots level and symposiums with voters, preparing to bring them to the local people's representative conferences for discussion.

Xinhua News Agency -- Chongqing, July 8 -- The broad masses of women in Chongqing have begun to enjoy the same rights as men in social reform movements and national construction. In last year's grassroots elections, more than 98 percent of female voters in the city participated in the elections. A total of 258 outstanding women in the city were elected as representatives to the grassroots people's congresses. In organizations such as neighborhood residents' committees and public security committees in the streets, female members account for more than 70 to 80 percent. Many women have participated in the work of government agencies. According to statistics from March 1953 alone, there were more than 6,000 female staff members in the agencies directly under the Chongqing Municipal People's Government, including more than 50 cadres at the section level or above. This number has increased significantly this year.

Many heavy industrial sectors such as iron and steel, machinery, and geology, as well as railway and shipping transportation departments, where women were never involved in the old China, now have outstanding female workers, female technicians, and female managers. Female planer He Yonghui, female welder Chen Zhaoqing, and female bus driver Zhang Mingsu are all experts in industrial production and transportation. In the textile industry, many advanced figures and advanced groups such as Qu Xiu, Yang Jiahua, and Zhao Lanying have emerged. Qu Xiu, a female worker at the Chongqing Shashi Yarn Factory who created the "fine yarn doffing method," has become a nationally renowned textile industry labor model. Many women who were illiterate in the past have also had the opportunity to learn culture after liberation. Lai SuGuang, a female worker at the 610 Textile Factory, could not even recognize her own name at the time of liberation. After studying at the workers' spare-time cultural school, she is now able to read newspapers, magazines, and documents. The Department of Electrical Engineering at Chongqing University has never had female students in the past, but now it does. Chen Shulan, a textile industry labor model in Chongqing, has also entered Renmin University.

Women are also continuously receiving national care in terms of marriage and family life. The number of new families with free marriages and equality and harmony is increasing in the city. Maternal and child health care in the city is constantly developing, with the number of nurseries of various types increasing from ten before liberation to fifty-five. Maternity stations and delivery teams have been established more universally in the city, and more than 90 percent of pregnant women have access to new delivery methods. Due to the development of health care, the spread of women's diseases and infant mortality rates have been greatly reduced. Wang SuFang, a worker's family member, gave birth to seven children before liberation, and none of them survived. The eighth child born last June is now growing up healthy and lively.

    重庆市广大妇女在社会改革运动和国家建设工作中，已开始享受到和男子一样的各种权利。在去年的基层选举中，全市有百分之九十八以上的妇女选民都参加了选举。全市有二百五十八名优秀的妇女当选为基层人民代表大会的代表。在街道的居民委员会和治安保卫委员会等组织中，妇女委员占百分之七十到百分之八十以上。许多妇女参加了政府机关的工作。仅据一九五三年三月的统计，重庆市人民政府直属机关便有女工作人员六千多人，其中科以上干部有五十多人。今年，这个数目又有很大增加。
    许多在旧中国从来没有妇女参加过的钢铁、机械、地质等重工业部门，以及铁路、轮船运输等部门，现在也有了出色的女工、女技术人员和女管理人员。女刨工何詠慧、女电焊工陈昭清、公共汽车女驾驶员张明素等，都是工业生产和运输战线上的能手。在纺织工业中，出现了屈秀、杨嘉华、赵兰英等许多先进人物和先进小组。创造“细纱落纱工作法”的重庆沙市纱厂女工屈秀等，已成为全国知名的纺织工业劳动模范。许多过去从来不识字的妇女，解放后也已得到学习文化的机会。六一零纺织厂女工赖素光解放时连自己名字也不认识，经过职工业余文化学校学习后，现在已能阅读报纸、杂志和文件。重庆大学电机系过去从来没有过女学生，现在也有女学生了。重庆市纺织工业劳动模范陈树兰还进了人民大学。
    妇女们在婚姻、家庭生活等方面，也不断受到国家的关怀。全市自由婚姻和平等和睦的新家庭日益增多。全市的妇幼保健工作正在不断发展，仅各种类型的托儿所就由解放前的十所增加到五十五所。全市已比较普遍地建立了接生站和接生组，已有百分之九十以上的产妇享受到新法接生。由于卫生保健事业的发展，妇女病的流传和婴儿死亡率都已大大降低。工人家属王素芳解放前生了七个孩子，一个也没有养活，去年六月生的第八个孩子，现在已长得很健壮很活泼了。　（新华社）
