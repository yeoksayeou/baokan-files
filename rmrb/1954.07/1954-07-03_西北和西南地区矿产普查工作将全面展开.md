Mineral prospecting work in the Northwest and Southwest regions is about to fully commence. All eleven work teams responsible for this year's mineral prospecting in the Northwest region have already set off. The first batch, consisting of five teams composed of students from the Geology Department of Northwest University, has arrived at the site and begun deploying their work. The second batch, consisting of six field work teams composed of some graduating students from the Northeast Institute of Geology, arrived in Xi'an on June 12th. Under the leadership of the Northwest Geological Bureau, they further studied exploration design and technology, and departed separately on June 19th. They felt infinitely honored to be assigned to mineral prospecting work in the Northwest. Female student Fan Jun expressed in her letter of determination: she would follow the teachings of the Party and contribute her youth to the great construction cause of the motherland.

There are a total of ten teams conducting mineral prospecting work in the Southwest region, including three large teams. The prospecting teams are mainly composed of graduating students and experts, professors, lecturers, and teaching assistants from the Geology Departments of Nanjing University and Chongqing University. This prospecting team will investigate valuable mineral deposits such as iron, coal, manganese, lead, and zinc in the plateaus and basins of various provinces in the Southwest, providing geological data for national industrialization and laying the foundation for future regular prospecting work. Currently, the first batch of work teams has departed from Chongqing for the work area on June 7th, after studying ethnic policies, field prospecting work methods, and relevant documents. The second batch of work teams, led by professors from Nanjing University, arrived in Chongqing on June 9th and are currently studying and organizing team designs, and will depart soon.

    西北和西南地区矿产普查工作将全面展开
    西北和西南地区的矿产普查工作即将全部展开。担负今年西北地区矿产普查的十一个工作队，已全部出发。第一批由西北大学地质系学生组成的五个队，已到达现场，开始部署工作。第二批由东北地质学院一部分本届毕业学生组成的六个野外工作队，六月十二日到达西安后，在西北地质局领导下，进一步作了勘探设计与技术方面的学习，于六月十九日分别出发。他们对到西北担任矿产普查工作感到无限光荣。女同学范军在决心书中表示：要遵照党的教导，为祖国伟大的建设事业贡献出自己的青春。
    在西南区进行矿产普查工作的共有十个队，其中有三个大型队。普查队主要是由南京大学和重庆大学的地质系应届毕业学生和专家、教授、讲师、助教所组成。这次普查队将分别在西南各省高原和盆地调查蕴藏地下的铁、煤、锰、铅、锌等宝贵矿藏，为国家工业化提供地质资料，并为将来开展经常化的普查工作打下基础。目前，第一批工作队学习了民族政策、野外普查工作方法和有关文件以后，已于六月七日由重庆向工作地区出发。第二批工作队由南京大学教授率领，于六月九日到达重庆，正进行学习和编队设计，将于最近出发。
