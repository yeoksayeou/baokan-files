Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, July 24th: The French newspaper "l'Humanité" published a statement by the French National Peace Council on the 22nd. The full text of the statement is as follows:

    The agreements just signed in Geneva prove that the spirit of consultation can overcome the policy of force.

    The French National Peace Council expresses its respect to those who died in battle and to the victims of the cruel and terrible Indochina War.

    It pays tribute to those who, even in the face of oppression, fought with unwavering action to end the war and to convene peace talks.

    The French National Peace Council, which has consistently called on all the French people to unite in order to end this war which is against the interests of the nation, knows that it has constantly expressed the will of the French nation to have peace. This desire for peace, finally expressed by the actions of the government and by Mendès-France in Geneva, has strengthened France's position in the eyes of the people of Asia and the world.

    The agreements reached have opened the way to establishing peace in Indochina. The state of war has been replaced by freely agreed cooperation between the French people and the unified and independent Vietnamese people. Following the Geneva talks, active efforts should be made to conclude political, economic, and cultural agreements that are in the interests of both the French and Indochinese peoples.

    The cessation of hostilities in Indochina, following the Korean armistice, is a new and important contribution to the easing of international tensions. In Asia, these negotiations have eliminated a center of war that threatened world peace. European problems can also be resolved peacefully through negotiations. The rearmament of Germany, whether through the European Defense Community or in any other form, is both a threat of war to Europe and a major obstacle to consultation.

    The French National Peace Council calls on the government to take the initiative to resume international negotiations to resolve the German question and to establish a security organization for all European countries. This demand expresses the will of the vast majority of the French people.

    祝贺印度支那停战协定的签订
    法国全国和平理事会发表声明
   【新华社日内瓦二十四日电】法国“人道报”二十二日刊载了法国全国和平理事会的一篇声明。声明全文如下：
    刚在日内瓦签订的协定证明协商精神可以胜过武力政策。
    法国全国和平理事会向那些战死的人、向那些残酷可怕的印度支那战争的受害者表示尊重。
  它向那些甚至不顾压迫而以不屈不挠的行动为结束战争、为召开和平谈判而斗争的人致敬。
    法国全国和平理事会一直号召法国全体人民团结起来以使这个违反民族利益的战争得以结束，它知道它已不断地表达了法国全国要求和平的意志。最后由政府的行动以及由孟戴斯—弗朗斯在日内瓦所表示出来的这种要求和平的意志，已经加强了法国在亚洲和全世界人民心目中的地位。
    已达成的协定打开了在印度支那确定建立和平的道路。战争状态已由法国人民和统一的、独立的越南人民之间的自由地同意的合作所代替。继日内瓦谈判之后，应积极设法缔结符合法国和印度支那人民利益的政治、经济和文化方面的各项协定。
    继朝鲜停战之后的印度支那敌对行动的停止，是对于国际紧张局势的缓和的一个新的、重要的贡献。在亚洲，这种谈判已消除了一个威胁着世界和平的战争中心。欧洲问题也可以通过谈判来和平解决。通过欧洲防务集团或以任何其他形式使德国重新武装，既是欧洲的一种战争威胁，也是进行协商的主要障碍。
    法国全国和平理事会要求政府采取主动重新举行国际谈判以解决德国问题，并建立所有欧洲国家之间的安全组织。它的这种要求是表达了绝大多数法国人民的意志的。
