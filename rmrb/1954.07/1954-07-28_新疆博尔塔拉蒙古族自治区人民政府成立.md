The Bortala River on both sides of the southern part of the Autonomous Prefecture has crisscrossing canals and abounds in wheat. Jinghe County in the east produces cotton and rice. Bole County in the central part also has high yields of wheat, corn, flax and other crops. Farmers participating in mutual aid and cooperation account for more than 59 percent of the total number of agricultural households in the region.
