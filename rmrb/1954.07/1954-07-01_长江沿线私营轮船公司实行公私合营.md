Private shipping companies along the Yangtze River, with the exception of a small number of vessels in individual ports, have essentially been brought into the orbit of national planning. Following the implementation of joint state-private operation of the Minsheng Shipping Company on September 1, 1952, many private shipping companies in the upper, middle, and lower reaches of the Yangtze River also applied to implement joint state-private operation. Currently, all private shipping companies have participated in the preparatory committees for the Chongqing Joint State-Private Sichuan River Company, the Shanghai Joint State-Private Yangtze River Shipping Company, and the Wuhan Joint State-Private Jingjiang Shipping Joint Stock Company. From now on, private shipping companies operating along the Yangtze River's 2,800-plus kilometers of navigable waterways have basically embarked on the path of state capitalism. From January to May of this year, these joint state-private ships undertook nearly half of the total passenger and freight transportation tasks along the entire Yangtze River.

The private shipping companies participating in the preparatory committees for the Joint State-Private Sichuan River Company, Jingjiang Shipping Joint Stock Company, and Yangtze River Shipping Company, under the direct leadership of the Yangtze River Navigation Administration and under unified planned management, have implemented a system of unified freight rates, unified dispatch, and unified sources of goods. When the preparatory committee for the Joint State-Private Yangtze River Shipping Company unified freight rates on April 1 this year, it reduced freight prices by an average of 30 percent and passenger prices by 19 percent, saving the people of northern Jiangsu approximately 11 billion yuan in transportation expenses annually. Previously, most of these private shipping companies operated at a loss, even lacking funds for the repair and maintenance of ships; during the preparation for joint state-private operation, the People's Government invested considerable funds and dispatched cadres to participate in management, thereby repairing the ships and gradually improving business management. Currently, over 80 percent of the ships of the preparatory committee for the Joint State-Private Yangtze River Shipping Company and the preparatory committee for the Jingjiang Shipping Joint Stock Company have undergone inspection and repair; the preparatory committee for the Yangtze River Shipping Company has also expanded a large waiting room for 1,000 people along the Huangpu River in Shanghai. The preparatory committee for the Joint State-Private Sichuan River Company has also rebuilt, purchased, and built new barges. (Xinhua News Agency)

    长江沿线私营轮船公司实行公私合营
    长江沿线私营轮船业除个别港口的少数船舶外，已基本上纳入国家计划轨道。民生轮船公司在一九五二年九月一日实行公私合营后，长江上、中、下游的许多私营轮船公司也纷纷申请实行公私合营。现各私营轮船公司都已分别参加了重庆的公私合营川江公司筹备委员会、上海的公私合营长江航运公司筹备委员会和武汉的公私合营荆江轮船股份有限公司筹备委员会。从此，长江二千八百多公里轮船通航里程中的私营轮船公司已基本走上国家资本主义道路。今年一月到五月，这些公私合营船舶为国家担负的客货运输任务将近长江全线客货运输总任务的一半。
    参加公私合营川江公司、荆江轮船股份有限公司和长江航运公司筹备委员会的私营轮船公司，在长江航运管理局的直接领导和在统一计划管理下，实行了统一运价、统一调度和统一货源的制度。公私合营长江航运公司筹备委员会在今年四月一日统一运价时，平均将货运价格降低了百分之三十，客运价格降低了百分之十九，每年约可为江苏北部人民节省一百数十亿元的运费开支。这些私营轮船公司以前大部分经营亏累，甚至无钱修理和养护船舶；在筹备公私合营中，人民政府分别投入了相当数量的资金和派了干部去参加管理，从而修理了船舶，经营管理也逐渐改善。现在，公私合营长江航运公司筹备委员会和荆江轮船股份有限公司筹备委员会都已有百分之八十以上的船舶经过检修；长江航运公司筹备委员会还在上海黄浦江边扩建了一个可容一千人的大候客室。公私合营川江公司筹备委员会还改建、购买和新建了驳船。（新华社）
