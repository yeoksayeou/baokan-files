One month ago, when the Central People's Government Committee published the "Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China," it issued a resolution stating that local people's governments at all levels nationwide should immediately organize widespread discussions of the draft constitution among the people, extensively explain the content of the draft constitution to the people, and mobilize the people to actively put forward their opinions on the revision of the draft constitution. According to this resolution, a broad mass movement to discuss the draft constitution is now underway throughout the country. In the discussions, the people are linking the main content of this fundamental law of the state with their own life experiences, gradually understanding its intimate relationship to themselves, and deepening their understanding and love for their country. Opinions on supplementing and revising the draft constitution are also constantly being put forward from all over the country.

Our constitution is a people's democratic constitution, a constitution of a socialist type. Every article in it must fully represent the will and the interests of the people. Therefore, we should implement a nationwide discussion of the draft constitution, so that the finally formally promulgated constitution truly becomes a concentrated expression of the people's will and can be implemented under the supervision of the people. Such a nationwide discussion is unimaginable for any bourgeois country.

The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong often taught us that the wisdom and creativity of the people are infinite, and the knowledge and experience of the people are the most practical and richest. Only by extensively absorbing the opinions of the masses can our leading organs and leaders make their decisions on various issues more perfect, more practical, and generate greater power in organizing and mobilizing the masses. Therefore, the leadership method of "from the masses, to the masses" is the fundamental leadership method of our Party and state organs. This mass line leadership method ensures that we can correctly concentrate the opinions of the people, transform the scattered opinions of the people into systematic opinions, and use them to guide the political, economic, and cultural activities of the people. All the policies decided by our Party and all the laws and decrees stipulated by our country must come from the masses and go to the masses, and should not be created out of thin air by a few people behind closed doors. Our draft constitution is also like this. It is a summary of the experience of the people's revolutionary struggle and national construction, and is concentrated from the practice of the people. The initial draft of this draft has been discussed by more than 8,000 people in total of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the leading organs of the major administrative regions and provinces and cities, the local organizations of various democratic parties and people's organizations, and the leading organs of the armed forces. In those two months or more of discussions, everyone put forward more than 5,900 suggestions for revising the initial draft, many of which were useful. The Constitution Drafting Committee revised the initial draft based on these opinions, which made the current draft constitution much more complete than the initial draft. Submitting this draft constitution to the people of the whole country for discussion, and more widely absorbing the opinions of people of all ethnic groups in different regions, classes, and occupations, will surely make the final formally promulgated constitution more perfect.

Through the discussion of the draft constitution, the people can actually recognize that our constitution is a true people's constitution: it not only represents the interests of the people, but is also truly formulated according to the will of the people. The people's sense of ownership of the country will be further enhanced, and the people will love their country even more, and show infinite strength in participating in national management and national construction.

Organizing the people to discuss the draft constitution is closely related to the implementation of the constitution after it is formally formulated. In order to implement our constitution, we must rely on the people to correctly exercise the power of the people in accordance with the constitution, realize the rights that the people should enjoy, and fulfill the obligations that the people should fulfill. The people should establish their own state organs in accordance with the constitution, and should exercise regular supervision over the state organs. Article 17 of the draft constitution stipulates that "all state organs must...accept the supervision of the masses." This is necessary to ensure that all the articles in the constitution can be implemented without compromise. Only by relying on broad mass supervision can the violations of the constitution that may occur in certain state organs and state workers be exposed and corrected at any time. After in-depth discussions on the draft constitution, the broad masses of people can become familiar with the main content and specific articles of the constitution, understand the various systems of our country, and know what principles we are following to build the country and carry out activities. This is a necessary condition for the implementation of the constitution.

The discussion of the draft constitution should be combined with publicity and education. Before the discussion, propagandists, reporters, and general party and government cadres should explain and illustrate the draft constitution to the masses, so that the masses can truly understand its main content; during the discussion, if the masses have any questions, supplementary explanations should be given at any time to answer the questions raised by the masses. It is necessary to make the masses truly understand the content and significance of the draft constitution before a truly in-depth discussion can be launched and opinions can be put forward.

The opinions expressed by the masses in the discussion must be carefully studied and handled. Even if many opinions do not fall within the scope of the constitution, but can be referred to when formulating general laws or regulations, they should be classified and collected, submitted to relevant agencies, and answers or explanations should be given to those who put forward the opinions as much as possible. If some people do not put forward suggestions for revising the draft constitution itself, but use the articles of the draft constitution to examine and criticize the work of certain state organs, staff members, or people's representatives, pointing out their shortcomings or errors, we should not prevent the masses from making such criticisms because we are discussing the draft constitution. We should not think that this goes beyond the scope of "discussion". Once the people recognize their position as masters after listening and discussing, such things may happen. This is certainly not a bad phenomenon, but a good phenomenon. This proves that the idea that all state power belongs to the people has begun to penetrate people's hearts and take effect. Therefore, we should welcome and support such demands of the people.

Whether in cities or rural areas, the people's production activities are now very tense. The discussion of the draft constitution must be effectively controlled by the leading organs, so that it can be carried out in depth without delaying production time or causing the masses to be too tired. The comrades who lead the discussion must also pay attention to the specific circumstances and production tasks of the local area, and assist in arranging production tasks and promoting the completion of production tasks. Flexible methods suitable for the masses to accept at the time and place should be adopted to organize the masses to conduct discussions, and efforts should be made to avoid extravagance and formalism.

### 普遍组织人民群众讨论宪法草案

    普遍组织人民群众讨论宪法草案
    一个月前，中央人民政府委员会在公布“中华人民共和国宪法草案”时，发布决议说，全国地方各级人民政府应立即在人民群众中普遍地组织对于宪法草案的讨论，向人民群众广泛地进行对于宪法草案内容的说明，发动人民群众积极提出自己对于宪法草案的修改意见。依据这一决议，全国各地现在正开展着广大群众性的对于宪法草案的讨论。在讨论中，人民群众联系自己的生活经验，逐步了解了国家这一根本大法的主要内容和它对于自己的切身关系，加深了对于自己国家的认识和热爱。对于宪法草案的补充和修改的意见，也从各地不断地提了出来。
    我国的宪法是人民民主的宪法，是社会主义类型的宪法。它的每一条文，都必须充分代表人民的意志和人民的利益。因此我们应该对宪法草案实行全民的讨论，使最后正式颁布的宪法真正成为人民意志的集中表现，并且能够在人民群众的监督之下贯彻实施。这样的全民讨论，对于任何资产阶级国家来说都是不可想像的事情。
    中国共产党中央和毛泽东同志经常教导我们，人民群众的智慧和创造力是无穷无尽的，人民群众的知识和经验是最实际也最丰富的。我们的领导机关和领导者只有广泛地吸收了群众的意见，才能使自己关于各种问题的决定更加完善，更加切合实际，更加能够在组织和动员群众的工作中发生巨大的力量。因此，从群众中来又到群众中去的领导方法，就是我们党和国家机关的根本领导方法。这种群众路线的领导方法，保证我们能够正确地集中人民的意见，把人民的分散的意见变成系统的意见，用以领导人民的政治、经济和文化活动。我们党所决定的一切政策和我们国家所规定的一切法律和法令，都是要从群众中来，又到群众中去，而不应该是由少数人闭门造车，凭空想出来的。我们的宪法草案也是这样。它是人民革命斗争和建设国家的经验总结，是从人民群众的实践中集中起来的。这个草案的初稿，曾经经过中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会、各大行政区和各省市的领导机关、各民主党派和各人民团体的地方组织，以及武装部队的领导机关一共八千多人的讨论。在那两个多月的讨论中，大家对草案的初稿提出五千九百多条修改意见，其中有许多是合用的。宪法起草委员会根据这些意见把初稿作了修改，这就使得现在的宪法草案比初稿完善多了。这个宪法草案交给全国人民讨论，更广泛地吸收不同地区、不同阶级和不同职业的各族人民的意见，就一定可以使最后正式颁布的宪法更加完善。
    人民群众通过宪法草案的讨论，就能够实际认识我国宪法是真正的人民宪法：它不仅代表人民的利益，而且是真正根据人民群众的意志来制定的。人民群众的国家主人翁感将因此而进一步提高，人民也就会更加热爱自己的国家，在参加国家管理工作和国家建设事业中表现出无穷的力量。
    组织人民群众讨论宪法草案，对于宪法在正式制定后的贯彻实施是有极密切关系的。为了贯彻实施我们的宪法，就要靠人民群众来按照宪法正确地行使人民的权力，实现人民所应享的权利，并执行人民所应尽的义务。人民群众要按照宪法来成立自己的国家机关，而且要对于国家机关实行经常的监督。宪法草案第十七条规定“一切国家机关必须……接受群众的监督”。这是为了保证宪法中的一切条文能够不折不扣地贯彻实行所必需的。只有依靠广大群众性的监督，才能随时揭发和纠正某些国家机关和国家工作人员中可能发生的违反宪法的行为。经过宪法草案的深入讨论，就能使广大人民群众熟悉宪法的主要内容和具体条文，了解我们国家的各种制度，知道我们是按照什么原则来建设国家和进行活动的。这是宪法贯彻实施的必要条件。
    宪法草案的讨论应该和宣传教育结合起来。在讨论以前，应该由宣传员、报告员及一般党政工作干部向群众进行关于宪法草案的讲解、说明，使群众切实了解它的主要内容；在讨论中，发现群众有不明白的地方，应该随时进行补充的讲解，解答群众提出来的问题。必须使群众真正明白了宪法草案的内容和意义，才能真正展开深入的讨论，提出意见。
    对于群众在讨论中所发表的意见，必须认真加以研究和处理。即使有许多意见并不属于宪法范围，而是可以在制定一般的法律或条例时参考的，也应该分类集中起来，提交有关的机关，并且要尽可能给提意见的人以答复或解释。如果有些群众不是对宪法草案本身提出修改意见，而是根据宪法草案的条文来检查和批评某些国家机关、工作人员或人民代表的工作，指出他们的缺点或错误，我们也不应该因为是讨论宪法草案，就不让群众提出这种批评。我们也不应该以为这是超越了“讨论”的范围。人民一旦经过听讲和讨论，认识了自己的主人翁地位，这样的事情是可能发生的。这当然并不是什么不好的现象，而是好的现象。这正是证明一切国家权力属于人民的思想开始深入人心，发生作用。因此对于人民的这种要求应该抱欢迎和支持的态度。
    无论城市或农村，人民的生产活动现在都非常紧张。宪法草案的讨论，必须由领导机关切实掌握，使它既能深入展开，又不致耽误生产时间，不使群众过分疲劳。领导讨论的同志，必须同时注意当地的具体情况和生产任务，并协助安排生产任务，推动生产任务的完成。应该灵活地采用适合当时当地群众所能接受的各种方式来组织群众进行讨论，要尽力避免铺张和形式主义。
