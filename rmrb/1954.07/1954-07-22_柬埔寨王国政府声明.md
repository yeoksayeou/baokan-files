    Statement of the Royal Government of Cambodia

    The Royal Government of Cambodia is determined never to participate in aggressive policies and will never allow Cambodian territory to be used to serve such policies.

    The Royal Government of Cambodia will not conclude any agreements with other countries if such agreements include obligations for the Royal Government of Cambodia to participate in military alliances that do not conform to the principles of the United Nations Charter, or include obligations to establish bases for foreign military forces on Cambodian territory when its security is not threatened.

    The Royal Government of Cambodia is determined to resolve its international disputes by peaceful means and in a manner that does not endanger international peace and security and justice.

    During the period from the cessation of hostilities in Vietnam until the final resolution of the political problems of that country, the Royal Government of Cambodia is determined to request foreign assistance related to war materials, personnel and instructors only for the benefit of effectively defending its own territory.
