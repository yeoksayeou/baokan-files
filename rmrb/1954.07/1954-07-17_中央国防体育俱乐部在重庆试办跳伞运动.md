    Central National Defense Sports Club Trials Parachuting in Chongqing

    Since February of this year, the Central National Defense Sports Club has been piloting parachute tower jumping in Chongqing. More than 800 workers, students, and cadres from many factories, schools, and organizations, including Chongqing Electrical Equipment Factory, Southwest Worker Daily Printing Factory, Chongqing No. 1 Middle School, Bashu Middle School, Chongqing No. 4 Girls' Middle School, Chongqing Women's Normal School, the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, and the Chongqing Municipal Women's Federation, have participated in this sport. Many young people have undergone sensory parachuting during the day and night, helicopter parachuting, and tower door parachuting, with some jumps nearing fifty times.

    Participating in parachuting can exercise the body, learn scientific knowledge and techniques of parachuting, and cultivate qualities such as courage, quick-wittedness, composure, and collectivist spirit. Dong Jinghui, a member of the Communist Youth League and a student at the Municipal Women's Normal School, had thicker arms and gained two kilograms in weight after participating in a parachute training course lasting more than twenty days. Many young workers and cadres are determined to become amateur parachutists. Many students who participated in aviation model groups have become even more determined to dedicate themselves to the construction of the motherland's aviation industry after participating in parachuting.

    Currently, young people in Chongqing who love parachuting are actively organizing parachuting groups in their respective units, using their spare time to learn about parachuting knowledge and practice parachuting movements. On the 35-meter-high parachute tower in Datianwan Square in the city, these young men and women are often seen practicing parachuting.

    中央国防体育俱乐部在重庆试办跳伞运动
    从今年二月起，中央国防体育俱乐部在重庆市试办了伞塔跳伞运动。重庆电工器材厂、西南工人日报印刷厂、市第一中学、巴蜀中学、市第四女子中学、市女子师范学校、青年团重庆市委会、市民主妇女联合会等许多工厂、学校和机关的八百多名工人、学生和干部，先后参加了这一运动。许多青年进行了白天和夜间的感性跳伞、直升跳伞和塔门跳伞、有的跳伞已近五十次。
    参加跳伞运动，可以锻炼身体，学习跳伞的科学知识和技术，培养勇敢、机敏、沉着等品质和集体主义的精神。青年团员、市女子师范学校学生董景慧，在参加了历时二十多天的跳伞运动训练班以后，胳臂比过去粗壮，体重增加了二公斤。不少青年工人和干部下决心要作一个业余的跳伞运动员。许多参加航空模型小组的学生参加跳伞运动以后，更加坚定了献身于祖国航空建设事业的决心。
    目前，热爱跳伞运动的重庆市的青年们正纷纷在本单位组织跳伞运动小组，利用业余和课余的时间，学习跳伞的知识，练习跳伞的动作。在该市大田湾广场的三十五公尺高的跳伞塔上，时常有这些男女青年在练习跳伞。
