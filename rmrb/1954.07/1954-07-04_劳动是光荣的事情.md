Labor is a Glorious Thing
Inventions and Creations are Encouraged
The clause in the draft constitution stating, "Labor is a glorious thing for all citizens of the People's Republic of China who have the ability to work. The state encourages the enthusiasm and creativity of citizens in their labor," greatly inspires the laboring people's enthusiasm for building socialism. In the old society, labor was looked down upon; the laboring people did not work for themselves; the laboring people only suffered exploitation, poverty, and unemployment. Take Guan Changjiang, the special-class labor model of Heilongjiang Province, for example. From the age of ten, he worked for landlords herding pigs and sheep, never having enough to eat or wear, and was often beaten and scolded, living a miserable and painful life. New China gave him the opportunity to enter a factory as an apprentice. Under the cultivation and education of the Party, and with the patient guidance of veteran workers, he was able to operate a machine tool and produce goods in less than a year, and gradually rose from an eighth-grade worker to a third-grade worker. With the development of production, his life also improved. Good working conditions and a happy life could not but make him think of this as the result of the victory of the Chinese People's Revolution.

In our country, labor is a glorious thing, and the state gives high honor to those who make inventions and creations in their work. Last year, Wang Chonglun's innovative deed of creating a universal tool tire greatly inspired Guan Changjiang. At that time, the wear-resistant cast iron sleeve of the Soviet-style "Type 153" vertical lathe manufactured by his factory was of poor quality and did not meet Soviet standards, becoming one of the main critical issues in the factory's production. Guan Changjiang studied manufacturing a boring tire mold, using drilling machines and milling machines instead of lathes. This plan immediately received the Party's support. The branch secretary said to him, "Go ahead and do it! Come to me if you have any difficulties!" In the process of making it, he also received help from technicians and veteran workers, and as a result, he succeeded in creating it. Production efficiency was increased eightfold, and the quality reached 100%. He was awarded the honorary title of special-class labor model of Qiqihar City and Heilongjiang Province. From the process of creating the tool, he deeply realized that the state actively encourages workers' inventions and creations; and only in our country can workers fully realize their labor enthusiasm and creativity.

Effort and Labor Bring Honor
Ruan Jin'e, a labor model in the textile industry of Zhejiang Province, read the draft constitution with incomparable joy. She recalled the life under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang. At that time, she worked as a trainee in a yarn factory in Ningbo. Her fingers developed sores, but she still had to insist on working; when the pain became unbearable and she wanted to ask for leave, she was immediately driven out by the capitalists. After liberation, she entered the state-owned Zhejiang Flax Textile Factory. The state cared very much about the workers. She was no longer afraid of being kicked out of the factory, nor was she afraid of getting sick or having sores. She worked hard and produced actively as the master of the country, became a labor model, attended the Provincial People's Representative Conference, and the government also sent her to the Czechoslovak Republic to attend the ceremony. All this is unimaginable for workers in capitalist countries.

In the Czechoslovak Republic, Ruan Jin'e saw workers happily working in their own factories. In the Lenin Textile Factory, she met a young girl. Although this girl was only nineteen years old, she was already a labor model. In that tall factory building, the looms clattered. The girl told her that their former factory was destroyed by the German fascist bandits, and this factory was built by themselves; the workers' enthusiasm for labor was very high, and she herself could now watch thirty-two looms alone. Ruan Jin'e also visited the family dormitory of the Stalin Oil Refinery, which was a thirteen-story building, and all the furniture belonged to the state. Workers could get good rest here after work. When she passed through the Soviet Union on her way back to China, she saw the face of the Soviet Union's great communist construction undertaking. Returning to her motherland, she saw the great construction of Anshan Iron and Steel, and the open-pit coal mine of Fushun… These are all new industries of our socialist country, all showing that we are advancing towards socialism by leaps and bounds. The draft constitution consolidated the achievements of our people's revolution through legislative procedures and promoted the people to continue to move forward. Ruan Jin'e was very excited about the promulgation of the draft constitution, and she said: "Let us, as masters of the country, actively work and launch a technical innovation movement to strive for the construction of a prosperous and happy socialist society!"

New Source of Inspiration
In the flower garden of the Yuxiang Textile Factory in Hunan Province, oleanders and cannas were blooming with bright flowers, and small pomegranates were full of pearl-like branches. The newspaper reader was reading the draft constitution aloud. The various clauses of the draft constitution inspired everyone here. On June 15th, the factory held a technical innovation performers' conference. Zhu Yindi, a female spinner of the South Factory and an advanced producer, one of the performers, had been repeatedly praised and rewarded in the struggle to complete the national plan. From her own experience, she understood how much the state valued the labor creativity and enthusiasm of the people. She said: "Our labor is for the happiness of everyone, so labor is a glorious thing. For example, the 648 spindles I now watch supply fabrics for more than 100,000 people every year. This means that my work, like that of thousands of laborers, will directly affect people's lives and national construction. The draft constitution has been promulgated, and we have more guarantees for building socialism; our responsibility is to work better and produce better." Zhu Yindi was encouraged by the new strength. On this day, she created excellent results. In a performance, she made a round every four minutes and twenty-four seconds on average, which was almost twice as fast as the general level. On this day, the output of the entire fine spinning workshop in the South Factory also averaged 0.05365 pounds per spindle per hour, exceeding the administrative target of 0.05318 pounds.

Night Watchman Work is Also Important
Ge Pingshun is a night watchman in the Qiqihar City No. 2 Department Store. He read the draft constitution word by word. He felt particularly close to Article 16 of the draft constitution, saying, "This article is so right! Only our country now regards labor as a glorious thing."

Ge Pingshun is fifty-nine years old this year. He spent fifty years in the old society, without a single day of peace. He used to live in Houkuler Village, Longjiang County, where he cultivated a few hectares of land. After paying the "shipping grain", it was not enough for a family to eat and drink, and he had to borrow money from the landlord Chang Lao San all year round. Chang Lao San's rule for lending money was "5% interest, 6% profit"; if you couldn't pay back the principal, the interest would accumulate on the interest. After a few years, Ge Pingshun's three dilapidated thatched houses and several hectares of land were all rolled in. Ge Pingshun could not live any longer, so in the first few years of the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, he ran to Qiqihar and asked people to find a job as a cook, but he was kicked out again soon. He thought, even if I want to earn a living by working hard, I can't find it. There's really nowhere to reason! He returned home and had to pick up coal kernels in a basket. The burden of life made him old.

After liberation, the people saw the blue sky. In 1948, Ge Pingshun's daughter Fenglan introduced him to work as a cook in a trading company. Later, he was transferred to the No. 2 Department Store as a night watchman, and has been there ever since. In recent years, because of his good work, he has been rated as a model worker for three consecutive years. The employees all respected him and affectionately called him Uncle Ge.

Uncle Ge is very satisfied with his current job. He said: "The job of a night watchman is also very important. At night, everyone is asleep, and the courtyard can't be left unattended. One night, I was patrolling back and forth in the courtyard when I saw the warehouse where the matches were piled up flickering and smoking. I knew that this must be a problem with the wires, so I quickly called people to turn off the power switch, and I stepped forward to pull off the two wire ends. Looking, there were large boxes of matches not far away, how dangerous it would be! This May, one day at two o'clock in the middle of the night, the rain was getting heavier and heavier. I called the comrades to cover the goods with tarpaulins, so the cotton and felt were not damaged."

    劳动是光荣的事情
    发明创造受到鼓励
    宪法草案中“劳动是中华人民共和国一切有劳动能力的公民的光荣事情。国家鼓励公民在劳动中的积极性和创造性。”这一条，大大鼓舞了劳动人民建设社会主义的热情。在旧社会，劳动是被人看不起的；劳动人民不是为自己劳动；劳动人民只有受剥削、贫困和失业。就拿黑龙江省特等劳动模范关长江来说吧。他从十几岁起就给地主放猪、放羊，吃不饱、穿不暖，还经常挨打受骂，过着悲惨痛苦的生活。新中国使他有机会进工厂当学徒，在党的培养和教育下，加上老师傅们的耐心教导，不到一年工夫，他就能操纵一台机床生产了，并且逐渐地由八级工提升为三级工。随着生产的发展，他的生活也改善了。良好的工作条件和幸福的生活，不能不使他想到这是中国人民革命胜利的成果。
    在我们国家里劳动是光荣的事情，对于在劳动中有发明创造的人，国家给以崇高的荣誉。去年王崇伦创造万能工具胎的革新事迹对关长江启示很大。那时他所在的工厂制造的苏式“一五三型”立车的耐磨铸铁套质量低劣，达不到苏联标准，成为全厂生产的主要关键之一。关长江就研究制造一个绞孔胎具，利用钻床、铣床代替车床。这一计划马上得到党的支持，支部书记对他说：“你做吧！有什么困难来找我！”在制做过程中，他又得到了技术人员、老工人的帮助，结果创造成功了，生产效率提高八倍，质量达到百分之百。他荣获了齐齐哈尔市、黑龙江省特等劳动模范的光荣称号。从创造工具过程中，他深深体会到国家是积极鼓励工人的发明创造的；也只有在我们国家里，劳动者才能充分发挥劳动的积极性和创造性。
    努力劳动才有荣誉
    浙江省纺织工业劳动模范阮金娥，怀着无比喜悦的心情读了宪法草案。她想起了国民党反动统治时代的生活。那时，她在宁波一个纱厂里做养成工，指头生了疮，还得坚持做工；实在痛得做不下去了，想请假，但马上就被资本家撵了出来。解放后，她进了国营浙江麻纺织厂。国家十分关怀工人，她不再怕被撵出工厂了，也不怕生病生疮了。她以国家主人翁的态度积极劳动生产，当了劳动模范，出席了省各界人民代表会议，政府还派她到捷克斯洛伐克共和国去观礼。这一切，在资本主义国家里的工人是做梦也想不到的。
    在捷克斯洛伐克共和国，阮金娥看到工人们都在自己的工厂里愉快地劳动着。在列宁纺织厂里，她碰到过一个年轻的姑娘。这个姑娘虽然还只十九岁，但已经是一个劳动模范了。在那高大的厂房里，织布机哗哗地响着，姑娘告诉她：她们以前的工厂被德国法西斯匪徒毁灭了，这个厂是她们自己建立起来的；工人们的劳动热情很高，她自己现在一个人能看三十二台布机。阮金娥还参观了斯大林炼油厂的家属宿舍，那是一幢十三层楼的大厦，家具全是国家的，工人们下工后在这里能够得到很好的休息。当她回国路过苏联时，她又看到了苏联的伟大的共产主义建设事业的面貌。回到祖国，她看到了鞍钢的伟大建设，看到了抚顺的露天煤矿，……这些都是我国社会主义的新工业，都显示了我们正在大踏步地向社会主义前进。宪法草案用立法的手续巩固了我国人民革命的成果，并推动人民继续前进。对于宪法草案的公布，阮金娥感到十分兴奋，她说：“让我们以国家主人翁的姿态，积极劳动，开展技术革新运动，为建设繁荣幸福的社会主义社会而奋斗吧！”
    新的鼓舞力量
    湖南省裕湘纺织厂的花圃里，夹竹桃、美人蕉怒放着鲜艳的花朵，小石榴珍珠似的结满了树杈。读报员在高声朗读着宪法草案。宪法草案各项条文激励了这里所有的人。六月十五日这天，厂里正举行技术革新者表演大会。表演者之一——南厂细纱女工、先进生产者朱银娣在完成国家计划的斗争中，一再地受到表扬和奖励，她从自己的经验理解到国家是多么重视人民的劳动创造性和积极性。她说：“我们的劳动是为了大家的幸福，所以劳动就是光荣的事情。譬如我现在看的六百四十八枚纱锭，每年平均要供应十多万人用的布匹。这就是说，我的工作也和千千万万劳动者一样，工作得好不好，会直接影响人民生活和国家建设。宪法草案公布了，我们建设社会主义更有了保证；我们的责任就是要更好地劳动，更好地生产。”朱银娣被新的力量鼓舞着，这天创造了优异的成绩，在一次表演中，平均每四分二十四秒钟就打了一个巡回，比一般水平快了将近一倍。这天整个南厂细纱车间的产量也平均达到每锭小时零点零五三六五磅，超过了行政指标——零点零五三一八磅。
    打更工作也很重要
    葛平顺是齐齐哈尔市第二百货商店的打更人。他一个字一个字地读着宪法草案。他对宪法草案第十六条感到分外亲切，说：“这条太对我的心思啦！只有我们现在的国家才把劳动当做光荣的事情。”
    葛平顺今年五十九岁，在旧社会整整熬过了五十年，没过过一天顺心的日子。他从前住在龙江县后库勒村，种几垧地，除去“出荷粮”不够一家人吃喝，常年得跟地主常老三借钱。常老三往外借钱的规矩是“五分息，六分利”；还不上本钱，就利上滚利。滚了几年，葛平顺的三间破草房和几垧地都被滚了进去。葛平顺没法生活下去，就在抗日战争胜利的头几年跑到齐齐哈尔，东求人、西托人找到做饭的差事，没多久他又被撵了出来，他想，凭自己卖力气吃饭的事都找不到，真是没地方说理去！他回到家里，只好提着筐检煤核。生活的重担把人都压老了。
    解放了，人民见了青天。一九四八年葛平顺的女儿凤兰介绍他到贸易公司做饭。以后他又被调到第二百货商店作打更的工作，一直到现在。几年来，由于他劳动好，接连三年被评为模范工作者。职工们都尊敬他，亲切地叫他葛大爷。
    葛大爷非常满意他现在的工作。他说：“打更这个工作也很重要。晚上，大伙都睡了觉，院子里没人照顾不行。有一天晚上，我正在院子里来回巡逻，看见堆火柴的仓库一亮一亮地冒火。我知道这
  一定是电线出了毛病，就赶紧招呼人关了电闸，我上前把两个电线头扯了下来。一看，不远的地方就放着大箱的火柴，这该多么危险！今年五月，有一天半夜两点钟，雨越下越大，我把同志们叫来，用油布将货物盖上，因此棉花和毡子都没有受到损失。”
