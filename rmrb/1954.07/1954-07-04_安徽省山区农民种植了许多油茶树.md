The oil-tea seedlings planted this year can grow into trees in three to five years, and each tree can produce more than ten catties of seeds per year. After shelling, every hundred catties can produce thirty-six to forty catties of oil.

    安徽省山区农民种植了许多油茶树。徽州专区的九个县已种植一万零四百多亩。大别山区的岳西、霍山两县已种植一千八百多亩。油茶树是山区农民的主要食油来源之一。今年种植的油茶幼苗经过三五年就可以长成树，每株每年可采籽十多斤，剥壳后每百斤可出油三十六斤到四十斤。
