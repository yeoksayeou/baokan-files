    For the Security of the Motherland
    Ai Pu
    On June 25th, the fourth anniversary of the Korean People's War Against Aggression, the heroes and meritorious individuals of a Second-Class Hero Company of the Volunteer Army held a forum to discuss the draft constitution on the banks of the Qingchuan River in Korea. Everyone present enthusiastically expressed their inner joy.
    Yang Guangjun, the fourth platoon leader who had been awarded three major merits, said excitedly: "Seeing the draft of the first people's constitution of the motherland, I was reminded of the life of a slave in the old society. When I was fifteen years old, my family was too poor to survive, so I went to work in a Japanese factory as a laborer, working twelve hours a day. When workers got sick, they were kicked out of the factory. I saw with my own eyes two workers who were electrocuted and disabled, and they were fired from the factory, later becoming beggars... But now, look at the new China! The draft constitution of the motherland clearly stipulates that workers have the right to rest and the right to receive material assistance in old age, sickness, or loss of working ability. How happy the working people are now! Recalling the five years of painful labor life before liberation and seeing today's draft constitution, I am indescribably happy in my heart. I firmly support this draft constitution, which was won with blood, and will strive for the thorough realization of the constitution."
    Long Dequan is a Miao soldier and a glorious member of the Communist Youth League. At the forum, he excitedly talked about the new changes in his family after liberation under the sunshine of the Communist Party's and Chairman Mao's national policies. He said excitedly: "In the old society, no one looked up to us Miao people. We dared not speak the Miao language; we dared not live with the Han people. I started working for the landlord when I was only ten years old; I was often beaten and scolded, never had enough to eat or wear, and wasn't even paid. Who cared about us Miao people then? After liberation, my family was allocated two mu of land and two houses, and also a ploughing ox. There was only my mother in the family, and no one to work, but the masses also helped with the farming, and life was very good. In 1952, a Miao Autonomous Region was established in our hometown, organizing our own Miao government. Article 3 of the draft constitution also clearly stipulates that all nationalities in the People's Republic of China are equal. This is something we could never have dreamed of in the old society!" He finally expressed that he would firmly support the constitution, hold the gun tightly in his hand, safeguard the security of the motherland for socialist construction, and safeguard the thorough realization of the constitution.

    为了祖国的安全

    六月二十五日，朝鲜人民反侵略战争四周年纪念日这天，在朝鲜清川江畔，志愿军某部二级英雄连队的英雄和功臣们开了一个讨论宪法草案的座谈会。到会的每一个人都热情地表达了自己内心的喜悦。
    荣立过三大功的四排长杨光君激动地说：看到祖国第一部人民宪法的草案，我就想起了在旧社会当奴隶的牛马生活。我十五岁因家里穷得过不下去；就进日本工厂当劳工，每天作工十二个小时；工人有病了就赶出工厂。我亲眼看到有两个工友被电打伤残废了，还被开除出工厂，后来当了乞丐，……然而现在新中国呢！祖国宪法草案上明文规定劳动者有休息的权利，在年老、疾病或者丧失劳动能力时有获得物质帮助的权利；现在的劳动人民是多么幸福啊！回想起解放前五年的劳工痛苦生活，看到今天的宪法草案，我内心里有说不出的高兴。我坚决拥护这个用鲜血换来的宪法草案，并为宪法的彻底实现而奋斗。
    龙德全是个苗族战士，光荣的青年团员。在座谈会上，他兴奋地谈起了他家解放后在共产党、毛主席的民族政策阳光照耀下所起的新变化。他激动地说：在旧社会没有人看得起我们苗家；我们不敢说苗语；不敢和汉人一起居住，我才十岁就开始给地主做活；经常挨打挨骂，吃不饱穿不暖还不给工钱，那时有谁关心我们苗家呢？解放后，我家分了二亩地和两间房子，还分了耕牛。家里只母亲一个人，没人劳动，群众还给代耕，生活过得很好。我们家乡在一九五二年又成立了苗族自治区；组织了我们苗家自己的政府。宪法草案上第三条又明确规定了中华人民共和国各民族一律平等。这是在旧社会做梦也想不到的事啊！他最后表示我要坚决拥护宪法，握紧手中的枪，保卫祖国安全进行社会主义建设，保卫宪法的彻底实现。
