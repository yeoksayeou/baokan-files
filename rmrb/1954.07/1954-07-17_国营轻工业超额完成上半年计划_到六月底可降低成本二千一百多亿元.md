State-Owned Light Industry Exceeds Half-Yearly Plan
Costs Reduced by Over 210 Billion Yuan by the End of June

[Our Newspaper] National state-owned light industry has overfulfilled the state production plan for the first half of the year. The total output value of state-owned light industry in the first half of the year reached 104.1% of the plan, accounting for 52.89% of the annual plan, an increase of 36.25% compared to the same period last year. State-owned light industries such as paper making, rubber, medicine, and tobacco and alcohol have all exceeded their output value plans. Many major products, such as automobile tires, various types of paper, pulp, sugar, glucose, procaine penicillin, cigarettes, and rubber shoes, have all exceeded their production plans. From January to May, the actual cost of state-owned light industrial products was reduced by more than 179 billion yuan compared to the planned cost. By the end of June, costs are expected to be reduced by more than 210 billion yuan. Labor productivity is expected to exceed the plan by 4.04%, and the amount of taxes and profits turned over to the state is expected to reach 54.86% of the annual plan. In terms of product quality, most enterprises in the rubber, food, and crude salt industries have also made relatively significant improvements.

In the first half of the year, many enterprises in state-owned light industry promoted advanced production experiences and achieved results. For example, after learning from the advanced experiences of other oil factories, the State-Owned China Oil Chemical Factory reduced the residual oil rate in the cake, which was previously thought to be impossible to lower, from 8.9% in March to below 6.5% in June, with the lowest reaching 5.5%. Many enterprises widely used substitutes, enabling production to continue as normal and reducing costs. For example, the Shandong Paper Mill used sunflower stalks instead of flax to manufacture cigarette paper, making the unit cost of products in the first quarter equivalent to 65% of the same quarter last year. Furthermore, they used lower-grade sunflower stalks instead of higher-grade sunflower stalks, and the cost in April was reduced by another 20.7% compared to January. In total, the amount saved from January to May by this method can be converted into raw materials for the production of 120 tons of cigarette paper.

In the completion of the first half of the year's production plan, some enterprises did not complete their output value plans or major product plans. The technical leadership in general enterprises is still very weak, and the quality of some products is not stable enough. Safety and hygiene work is not done well enough, and there are still many accidents. Waste of materials and a lack of responsibility in production are relatively common. These shortcomings still need to be improved in the second half of the year in order to strive for the comprehensive completion of the annual state plan.

    国营轻工业超额完成上半年计划
    到六月底可降低成本二千一百多亿元
    【本报讯】全国国营轻工业超额完成了上半年国家生产计划。国营轻工业上半年总产值计划完成百分之一○四·一，为全年计划的百分之五十二·八九，与去年同期比较增长了百分之三十六·二五。国营轻工业中的造纸、橡胶、医药、烟酒等工业都超额完成了产值计划。许多主要产品如汽车外胎、各种纸、纸浆、糖、葡萄糖、普鲁卡因青霉素、卷烟、胶鞋等都超额完成了产量计划。一月到五月，国营轻工业产品实际成本比计划成本降低一千七百九十多亿元，到六月底，成本可降低二千一百多亿元；劳动生产率可超过计划百分之四·○四；上缴任务可完成年计划的百分之五十四·八六。在产品质量方面，橡胶、食品和原盐等行业中的多数企业也有比较显著的改进。
    在上半年，国营轻工业中的许多企业推行先进生产经验，取得了成绩。如国营中国油脂化学厂学习其他油脂厂的先进经验后，一向认为不能降低的饼中残油率，由三月份的百分之八·九，降低到六月份的六·五以下，最低到五·五。许多企业广泛地利用代用品，使生产照常进行，并且降低了成本。如山东造纸厂用葵麻代替线麻制造卷烟纸，使第一季度的产品单位成本相当于去年同季的百分之六十五，以后更进一步用低级葵麻代替高级葵麻，四月份的成本又比一月份降低百分之二十·七，总计一月到五月由此节约的金额，折合原料可供生产一百二十吨卷烟纸之用。
    在完成上半年生产计划中，有些企业的产值计划或主要产品计划没有完成；一般企业中的技术领导还很薄弱，部分产品的质量不够稳定；安全与卫生工作做得不够，事故还很多；浪费材料以及生产中的无人负责现象比较普遍。这些缺点还有待于下半年努力改进，以争取全面地完成全年国家计划。
