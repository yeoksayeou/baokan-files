Zhejiang Transportation Company Driver Chen Rongcai
    4.5 Years of Safe Driving, Over 187,800 Kilometers
    Chen Rongcai is a driver at Zhejiang Province Transportation Company. From December 1949 to the end of June this year, the passenger bus he drove has safely travelled more than 187,880 kilometers, and the engine's intermediate repair mileage reached more than 153,700 kilometers, creating a personal best record for safe driving.
    In the past four years, under the cultivation and education of the Party, Chen Rongcai has established a high sense of responsibility for the people's transportation undertaking. He deeply understands that drivers must pay attention to safe driving, extend vehicle life, and save driving consumption. He conscientiously studied advanced driving methods, carefully studied driving techniques, and was familiar with the performance of the vehicle. He was able to regularly maintain the normal and intact condition of various parts. Even if a failure occurred, he could quickly detect it and check and adjust it in time.
    Chen Rongcai can also closely cooperate with technicians. Whenever the car returns to the depot, he actively contacts the technicians, reflects the driving conditions of the day, and assists the technicians in inspection to ensure the vehicle is in good technical condition.
    He regularly performs maintenance operations. In addition to routine maintenance, he performs first-level maintenance with the maintenance technician every 900 to 1,000 kilometers, and actively assists the maintenance technician in performing second-level maintenance every 2,800 to 3,200 kilometers. Combine first-level maintenance with cleaning of gas filters, oil filters, and air filters. After each trip, thoroughly clean the filters, replace or supplement the filter material, and prevent filter gaps from affecting the filtering effect. He can always keep the vehicle clean and the engine full of power. At the same time, Chen Rongcai also attaches great importance to tire maintenance, inspection, and usage methods. He regularly checks tire pressure, pays attention to even load distribution when loading goods, and promptly swaps the positions of the front, rear, inner, and outer tires to extend the tire mileage. Therefore, the service life of the tires exceeds the company's quota by 70.2%.
    In driving, Chen Rongcai has consistently maintained concentration, always been vigilant, and conscientiously abided by operating procedures and traffic regulations. His work attitude is humble and cautious. He takes familiarizing himself with the terrain and routes and studying climate changes as his own task, and is able to make specific safety measures to adapt to these situations. Before driving, he carefully checks the normal condition of parts such as seats, backrests, horns, headlights, tie rods, tires, and steel plates, and conducts some necessary safety publicity for passengers. When driving in densely populated areas and places where people and livestock cross the road, he reduces the driving speed and does not honk the horn indiscriminately to avoid startling livestock. Therefore, in the past few years, he has not only never had an accident while driving, but even the paint on the car has not been scratched.
    In October 1953, at the model worker selection meeting, Chen Rongcai also proposed to learn from the Soviet Union's advanced driver A. Ye. Kitov, who created 300,000 kilometers without major repairs, and strive for 300,000 kilometers of safe driving.

    浙江运输公司驾驶员陈荣材
    四年半安全行驶十八万七千八百多公里
    陈荣材是浙江省运输公司的驾驶员，自一九四九年十二月至本年六月底，他驾驶的客车已安全行驶十八万七千八百八十余公里，引擎中修里程达十五万三千七百余公里，创造了安全行驶个人最高纪录。
    四年来陈荣材在党的培养教育下，对人民交通运输事业树立了高度责任心。他深知驾驶员必须注意安全行驶，延长车辆寿命，节约行车消耗。他认真地学习了先进驾驶方法，细心钻研驾驶技术，熟悉地掌握车辆的性能，能够经常保持各部机件的正常完好，即使发生故障，也能迅速地发觉，及时检查调整。
    陈荣材又能同技工密切配合，每当车子回场后就主动与技工联系，反映当日出车情况，协助技工检查，保证车辆技术状况良好。
    他定期执行保养作业，除进行例行保养外，每行驶九百至一千公里，即与保养技工共同进行一级保养，行驶二千八百公里至三千二百公里，主动协助保养技工进行二级保养。结合一级保养做好煤气滤清，机油滤清，空气滤清。每趟行驶后，彻底进行滤清器的清洁工作，更换或补充滤料，防止影响滤清作用的滤隙。他能经常保持车辆清洁与发动机的充沛力量。同时，陈荣材也很重视轮胎的保养、检查和使用方法，经常检查轮胎气压，装货时注意荷重均匀，及时地调换前后里外轮胎位置，延长轮胎的行驶里程，所以轮胎的使用期限超过公司定额百分之七十点二。
    陈荣材在驾驶中一贯保持思想集中，随时提高警惕，认真遵守操作规程和交通规章。他的工作态度是虚心谨慎，把熟悉地形路线、研究气候变化当作自己的任务，并能作出适应这些情况的具体安全措施。开车前他仔细检查座席、靠背、喇叭、前灯、横直拉杆，轮胎和钢板等机件的正常程度，对车上旅客进行一些必要的安全宣传。汽车行驶在人烟稠密和人、畜横穿马路的地方，他减低行车速度，不乱鸣喇叭，避免牲畜惊恐乱窜。所以几年来他驾驶汽车不仅没有发生过一桩事故，连汽车上的油漆也未擦坏过。
    一九五三年十月，在评选模范大会上陈荣材又提出向苏联创造三十万公里无大修的先进司机亚·叶·基拖夫学习，争取安全行驶三十万公里。
