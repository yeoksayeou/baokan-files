    Major Proposal for Establishing European Collective Security

    On July 24th, the Soviet government sent notes to the governments of France, Britain, and the United States, reiterating its proposition on establishing European collective security and suggesting that a conference be convened in the coming months, attended by all European countries willing to participate, as well as the United States, to exchange views on the issue of establishing a European collective security system. The Soviet government also considered it appropriate for the People's Republic of China to send an observer to attend the conference. This proposal from the Soviet government is of utmost importance, representing another positive step taken by the Soviet government since the Berlin Conference to seek guarantees for European collective security.

    Undoubtedly, the Soviet proposal will receive widespread support and endorsement from peace-loving forces in Europe and around the world. Premier Zhou Enlai of our country, currently visiting the German Democratic Republic in Berlin, and Prime Minister Grotewohl of the German Democratic Republic, issued a joint statement expressing their active support for this Soviet proposal.

    In recent years, the issue of European security has increasingly attracted close attention and concern from various European countries and broad sections of people worldwide. This is due to the U.S. ruling clique's efforts since the end of World War II to split Germany, divide Europe, and pursue a policy of arms expansion and war preparations. In 1949, it organized the exclusive military bloc—the North Atlantic Treaty Organization—with Britain, France, and other Western European countries, as well as Canada, posing a serious threat to European security and world peace. To prepare for a new war in Europe, the United States has also coerced Western European countries into organizing the so-called "European Defense Community" to revive West German militarism as a tool for its aggressive adventures. The United States is clearly trying to repeat its old trick in Europe: creating opposing military blocs, thereby creating war. This is absolutely incompatible with the peace aspirations of the peoples of European countries and their vital interests, and it is also completely contrary to the requirements of the peace and security of all countries in the world.

    In order to eliminate the threat of war in Europe and consolidate international peace, the Soviet government has consistently and actively strived for an early and peaceful resolution of the German question on a fair and reasonable basis, to establish peace and security in Europe. At the Four Power Foreign Ministers' Conference held in Berlin in February this year, the Soviet government put forward a series of practical and feasible proposals for resolving the German question, and submitted the "Guaranteeing European Security" proposal and the draft "All-European Treaty on Guaranteeing European Collective Security" for discussion at the conference. After the Berlin Conference, the Soviet government sent notes to the governments of France, Britain, and the United States on March 31st, proposing the issue of concluding an all-European treaty on guaranteeing European collective security, and the Soviet government expressed its willingness to jointly study with the governments of relevant countries the opinions on the Soviet Union's participation in the North Atlantic Treaty. The Soviet proposal on establishing European collective security not only helps to eliminate the hostile situation in Europe but also helps to remove obstacles to resolving the German question, creating favorable conditions for the restoration of German unity. Therefore, it is the most effective way to guarantee European security.

    Disregarding the peace aspirations of the peoples of European countries and the world, the United States coerced Britain and France at the Berlin Conference into unreasonably rejecting the Soviet proposals on peacefully resolving the German question and establishing a European collective security system, preventing the German question and the issue of guaranteeing European security from being resolved. Since the end of the conference, the United States has intensified its promotion of the "European Defense Community" plan, regarding the Soviet proposal on establishing European collective security as a major obstacle to accelerating the revival of German militarism, dividing Europe, and preparing for a new war, and has made every effort to distort and slander it, attempting to offset the sympathy and support of the peoples of Western European countries for the Soviet proposal. The notes from the governments of the United States, Britain, and France to the Soviet government on May 7, 1954, unreasonably rejected the new proposals put forward by the Soviet Union to ensure European security. However, everyone can see that the various reasons on which the Western three countries are based are completely untenable. As pointed out in the Soviet note of July 24, the US, British and French governments are in fact trying to obliterate the need for security for all European countries - regardless of their social system - and stubbornly adhere to the policy of establishing exclusive military groupings. The purpose of these military groupings they have established is to confront other countries, which will inevitably lead to an arms race, worsen international relations and thus cause new wars. The United States' coercion of Britain and France to refuse to consider the possibility of the Soviet Union joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organization fully confirms the aggressive nature of this organization.

    However, the Soviet Union's repeated proposals to guarantee European collective security have taken root in the hearts of the peoples of European countries and have received widespread support. The peoples of Western European countries have seen in the Soviet proposals the real way to guarantee European security and peace, and realize that they have no reason to follow the dangerous path arranged by the United States. Since the end of the Berlin Conference, the movement in Western European countries against the United States' unreasonable rejection of the Soviet proposals and its intensification of the "European Defense Community" plan has further intensified, and people from all walks of life in various countries have increasingly participated in this movement. In the recent referendums held in East and West Germany, more than 90 percent of the people expressed their opposition to the "European Defense Community" treaty and the "General Treaty." The French people have regarded opposing the establishment of the "European Army" as an important action to safeguard national sovereignty and national security; Many French political leaders believe that the Soviet proposal to establish a European collective security system is the best alternative to the "European Defense Community" plan. It is precisely because of the growing strength of the forces opposing the "European Army" in France that the "European Army" treaty has not been ratified by the French parliament. The international conference of opponents of the "European Defense Community" held in Paris in March this year by more than 100 parliamentarians and well-known social leaders from Western European countries strongly demonstrated that the forces maintaining European peace are increasingly uniting widely. The United States' arbitrary and dictatorial policies are becoming increasingly untenable.

    The Soviet Union's proposal this time fully represents the common aspirations of the peoples of European countries. Therefore, it immediately aroused the attention and sympathy of public opinion in European countries. However, it has been noted that US Secretary of State Dulles stated at a press conference on July 23 that he did not support reconvening a meeting to discuss Germany, Korea, disarmament and European security issues. According to reports from the US news agency, US State Department officials openly stated that the United States would coerce Britain and France to "firmly reject this proposal." The peoples of European countries and all peace-loving people in the world will never allow the United States' arbitrary practice of opposing consultation and pursuing war.

    The Chinese people are concerned not only about peace in Asia, but also about peace in Europe and peace in the whole world. From their own experience in struggle, especially in the anti-fascist war, the Chinese people deeply understand the principle that peace is indivisible. In those years, the fascist aggressive forces of Germany, Italy, and Japan formed the "Anti-Comintern Axis," which burned the world outside the American continent, creating profound disasters. Today, American imperialism is also waving the rotten "anti-communist" banner everywhere, piecing together aggressive blocs, claiming to be the boss, and attempting to realize its arrogant plan to dominate the world. It has set fires in Asia and is plotting to provoke a new world war in Europe and around the world; if this sinister plot succeeds, the damage it will bring to human civilization and labor achievements will not be comparable to the Second World War. As the Sino-German Prime Ministers' Communiqué pointed out: "The United States' rearmament of West Germany and Japan is not to establish the defense forces of Germany and Japan, but to threaten peace in Europe and Asia. Therefore, the struggle against the rearmament of West Germany and Japan has become the common task of all peace-loving people." Therefore, the Chinese people, like the German people and the peoples of all countries, resolutely oppose the United States' policy of supporting German and Japanese militarist forces, oppose any behavior that creates division and antagonism, and strive to establish and consolidate collective security and peace. The Soviet Union's proposal to convene a conference of all European countries as well as the United States to discuss the establishment of European collective security, and its view that the People's Republic of China should send observers to attend this conference, is in line with the peace aspirations and national interests of the peoples of all countries. The Chinese people hope that this meeting can be convened and are willing to have their own observers attend. We believe that if a European collective security system can be established, it will greatly help promote peace in all regions of the world.

    The Soviet proposal is urgently needed and very timely. The Geneva Conference has achieved another victory for peace in Asia, ending the Indochina War, which was fraught with the crisis of international conflict. This proves that it is possible to resolve serious problems in Asia through consultation, and paves the way for the peaceful resolution of other important international problems, including the German problem, which is of universal concern. As long as the countries concerned embrace the sincerity of peace, especially those Western European countries that have a direct stake in the German question, can adopt independent and autonomous policies based on their own national interests, then it is possible to convene a conference to discuss European collective security, and it will make positive achievements for the consolidation of European peace.

### 建立欧洲集体安全的重大建议

    建立欧洲集体安全的重大建议
    苏联政府于七月二十四日照会法、英、美三国政府，重申了关于建立欧洲集体安全的主张，并建议在今后几个月内召集愿意参加会议的一切欧洲国家以及美国举行会议，来就建立欧洲集体安全体系的问题交换意见。苏联政府并认为中华人民共和国派遣一名观察员列席这次会议，是适宜的。苏联政府的这一建议是十分重要的，这是苏联政府自柏林会议以来为谋求保障欧洲集体安全所采取的又一积极步骤。
    毫无疑问，苏联的这一建议，将得到欧洲及全世界爱好和平力量的广泛支持和拥护。现在正在柏林访问德意志民主共和国的我国周恩来总理与德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥发表联合声明表示积极支持苏联的这个建议。
    最近几年来，欧洲的安全问题已日益引起了欧洲各国以及全世界广泛人士的密切关怀和注意。这是由于美国统治集团自第二次世界大战结束以来就竭力分裂德国，分裂欧洲，推行扩军备战政策，并于一九四九年与英、法等西欧国家以及加拿大，组织了排他性的军事集团——北大西洋军事联盟，造成了对欧洲安全和世界和平的严重威胁。为了在欧洲准备新的战争，美国并胁迫西欧国家组织所谓“欧洲防务集团”，以复活西德军国主义，来作为它进行侵略冒险的工具。美国显然是想重复在欧洲的老路：制造对立的军事集团，从而制造战争。这是与欧洲各国人民的和平愿望和他们的切身利益绝对不相容的，并且与世界各国的和平安全的要求也是完全相违背的。
    苏联政府为了消除欧洲的战争威胁和巩固国际和平，一贯积极争取在公平合理的基础上早日和平解决德国问题，以建立欧洲的和平与安全。在今年二月在柏林举行的四国外长会议上，苏联政府提出了解决德国问题的一系列的切实可行的建议，并提出了关于“保障欧洲安全”的建议和“保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约”草案供会议讨论。在柏林会议之后，苏联政府又于三月三十一日照会法、英、美三国政府，提出关于缔结保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约问题和苏联政府表示准备和有关国家政府共同研究关于苏联参加北大西洋公约问题的意见。苏联关于建立欧洲集体安全的建议，不但有助于消除欧洲的敌对形势，并有助于扫除解决德国问题的障碍，为恢复德国的统一创造有利的条件，因而它是保障欧洲安全的最有效的途径。
    美国不顾欧洲各国及全世界人民的和平愿望，在柏林会议上挟持英法两国，毫无道理地拒绝了苏联关于和平解决德国问题以及建立欧洲集体安全体系的建议，使德国问题和保障欧洲安全问题不能获得解决。会议结束以来，美国更加紧推行其“欧洲防务集团”计划，把苏联关于建立欧洲集体安全的建议看作是它加速复活德国军国主义、分裂欧洲和准备新战争的主要障碍，竭力加以歪曲和诽谤，企图抵消西欧各国人民对苏联建议的同情和支持。美、英、法三国政府一九五四年五月七日致苏联政府的照会，竟毫无道理地拒绝苏联为保障欧洲安全而提出的新建议。但是，谁都看得见，西方三国所根据的各种理由是完全站不住脚的。正如苏联七月二十四日的照会中所指出的，美、英、法政府事实上是企图抹煞所有欧洲国家——不论其社会制度如何——的安全的必要性，顽固地坚持建立排他的军事集团的方针。它们建立的这些军事集团的目的，是要和其他国家作对，这就不可避免地要导致军备竞赛，使国际关系恶化，从而引起新战争。美挟持英法拒绝考虑苏联参加北大西洋公约组织的可能性问题，也完全证实了这个组织的侵略性质。
    但是苏联一再提出的保障欧洲集体安全的建议，在欧洲各国深入人心，得到了广泛的支持。西欧各国人民从苏联的建议中看到了保障欧洲安全与和平的真正途径，认识到他们没有理由按照美国所安排的危险道路走。自柏林会议结束以来，西欧各国反对美国无理拒绝苏联建议、加紧推行“欧洲防务集团”计划的运动更进一步地高涨起来，各国广泛阶层的人士越来越多地参加了这个运动。最近在德国东西部举行的公民投票中，有百分之九十以上的人表示反对“欧洲防务集团”条约和“一般性条约”。法国人民已把反对建立“欧洲军”作为维护民族主权与国家安全的重要行动；法国有很多政治领袖都认为苏联关于建立欧洲集体安全体系的建议是代替“欧洲防务集团”计划的最好办法。正是由于法国国内反对“欧洲军”的力量日益壮大，使得“欧洲军”条约一直未能在法国议会中获得批准。西欧各国一百多名议员和著名社会领袖今年三月间在巴黎举行的“欧洲防务集团”反对者国际会议，更是有力地表明了维护欧洲和平的力量，正在日益广泛地联合起来。美国武断专横的政策越来越行不通了。
    苏联这一次的建议，充分代表了欧洲各国人民的共同愿望。因而，它立即引起欧洲各国舆论的重视和同情。但是，人们注意到，美国国务卿杜勒斯在七月二十三日的记者招待会上，曾表示他不赞成再度召开会议讨论德国、朝鲜、裁减军备和欧洲安全问题。据美国通讯社的电讯说，美国国务院官员公开表示，美国将胁迫英法两国“坚决拒绝这项建议”。欧洲各国人民和全世界爱好和平人民决然不能容许美国这种反对协商、追求战争的专横做法。
    中国人民不仅关心亚洲的和平，而且关心欧洲的和平和全世界的和平。中国人民从自己的切身斗争经验中，特别是在反法西斯战争中，深切地体会到和平不可分割的道理。当年德、意、日三国法西斯侵略势力结成了“反共轴心”，在除了美洲大陆以外的世界地区内烧遍了大火，制造了深重的灾难。今天美帝国主义也同样打着腐烂的“反共”旗子到处拚凑侵略集团，称王称霸，图谋实现独霸世界的狂妄计划。它曾经在亚洲放了火，并在欧洲在全世界策划挑起新的世界大战；如果这个罪恶阴谋得逞，它给人类文明和劳动成果带来的损害，将不是第二次世界大战所能比拟的。正如中德两国总理会谈公报所指出的：“美国重新武装西德和日本并非为了建立德国和日本的自卫力量，而是用以威胁欧洲和亚洲的和平，因此，反对重新武装西德和日本的斗争，成了所有爱好和平人民的共同任务。”因此，中国人民及德国人民和各国人民一样坚决反对美国扶植德国和日本军国主义势力的政策，反对任何制造分裂和对立的行为，争取建立和巩固集体的安全与和平。苏联建议召集一切欧洲国家以及美国举行会议，讨论建立欧洲集体安全问题，并认为中华人民共和国应派遣观察员列席这次会议，这个建议是符合各国人民的和平愿望和国家利益的。中国人民希望这个会议能够召开，并愿意有自己的观察员列席。我们相信，欧洲集体安全体系如能建立，必将大大有助于促进世界各个地区的和平。
    苏联的建议是迫切需要的，而且是十分适时的。日内瓦会议已为亚洲谋得了另一个和平的胜利，结束了潜伏着国际冲突危机的印度支那战争。这证明了用协商方式解决亚洲的严重问题是可能的，并为和平解决包括举世关心的德国问题在内的其他重要国际问题铺平了道路。只要有关各国怀抱和平的诚意，特别是那些与德国问题有切身利害关系的西欧国家，如能根据自己的民族利益，采取独立自主的政策，那末，召开讨论欧洲集体安全的会议是可能的，而且会为欧洲和平的巩固取得积极的成就。
