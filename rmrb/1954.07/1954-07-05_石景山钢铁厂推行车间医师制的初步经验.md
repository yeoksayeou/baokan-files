    Preliminary Experience of Shijingshan Steel Plant in Implementing the Workshop Physician System
    Wang Yuanming, Head of the Health Section of Shijingshan Steel Plant

    Since December of last year, the Shijingshan Steel Plant Workers' Hospital has been studying and piloting the advanced Soviet industrial hygiene experience—the workshop physician system—and has achieved preliminary success in implementing the principle of "prevention first" and carrying out medical and preventive work.
    In recent years, the medical and health work of the Shijingshan Steel Plant has greatly improved. It has played a certain role in protecting the health of workers and ensuring the completion of production tasks. However, many medical personnel still have a strong emphasis on simple treatment and simple prevention. Medical work is rarely combined with the patient's work, life, and ideological situation. They only use drugs or surgical treatment. In addition, the medical organization is unreasonable, and the outpatient methods of various科 physicians are not good. Clinical physicians do not understand the on-site production process and the working environment. To some extent, this limits the guarantee effect of medical and health work on the health of employees and production. In September 1953, we implemented a protective medical system, which initially overcame the above shortcomings and changed medical work from passive to active, but the problem has not been completely resolved. Therefore, on the basis of implementing the protective medical system and doing a good job in treatment, it has become an urgent task for us to further implement the principle of "prevention first" and to make medical and health work oriented towards production and workshops. According to the instructions of the Central Ministry of Health and the Health Department of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry, under the guidance of Soviet experts, we studied the advanced Soviet industrial hygiene experience—the workshop physician system. We realized that this is the most superior organizational form for combining treatment and prevention, implementing the principle of "prevention first," bringing excellent medical technology into the workshops, and improving the quality of medical prevention. It is also the main method for medical personnel to clarify the division of labor, strengthen their sense of responsibility, overcome shortcomings in their work, and do a good job in industrial hygiene. Therefore, in December of last year, we made the decision to pilot the workshop physician system.
    During the preparation stage, the ideological situation of health personnel at all levels was very chaotic. The hospital leaders only knew that the system was good, but they did not know how to do it. They believed that since it was a new job and they could not find specific implementation methods suitable for the plant's situation, they would definitely take detours in the pilot work, showing a lack of confidence. Some physicians who had previously worked in the workshops believed that this was still the same old story and would probably still be unwelcome, so it would be better to focus on treatment. They also believed that most of the existing physicians and medical assistants in the internal medicine department were women, and it would be difficult for them to go down to the workshops and integrate with the workers. As for the general medical staff, they believed that workshop leaders attached importance to production but not to health work. They did not support the suggestions put forward by the medical staff. Therefore, to do a good job in health work, there must be specialized health institutions and specialized personnel. Others believed that occupational health and hygiene and epidemic prevention work were the responsibility of public health experts, not clinical physicians. Now there are many patients, and outpatient work is busy, so it is difficult for medical staff to find time to do this work, so it is impossible to achieve results. And the leaders at all levels in the workshops believed that medical personnel going to the field was not a good thing, either "picking faults" or "creating problems" and "adding trouble." They would make a lot of comments about ventilation, lighting, daylighting, and ventilation, making it impossible to cope. The workers thought that physicians going to the workshops was just the same old story, and they had already experienced it: it does not solve the problem.
    In order to eliminate the above ideological obstacles, on the one hand, we carried out ideological mobilization among the medical staff, and at the same time used specific examples to criticize the erroneous understanding of some medical staff, and educated everyone to realize that the key to doing a good job in workshop health work lies in the work attitude, work methods, and determination of the medical staff. On the other hand, we used specific examples and cost-accounting methods to explain the close relationship between health work and production to leaders at all levels in the workshops. And in response to the shortcomings in the past work of medical staff, through key experiments, we adopted the following methods to reverse the workshop leaders' understanding of health work. First, actively solve the problem of workshop patients seeing a doctor. Do preventive work on the basis of seeing outpatient patients, instead of simply doing prevention. At the same time, while treating patients, publicize the causes and prevention methods of the diseases they suffer from, in order to attract the attention of employees and establish the prestige of medical staff. Second, in the early stage of going to the workshop, solve some problems that affect the health of employees and are relatively easy to solve through mass mobilization, such as improving environmental hygiene and improving production tools, and report the improved situation to the workshop leaders to attract their attention and gain their support. Third, reduce the burden on on-site leaders in taking care of the sick and injured. Workshop health workers actively visit sick workers and report the visit to the workshop leaders. In this way, the patients feel the care of the leaders; the leaders feel that the health workers really solve the problem. Fourth, regularly report the work of the workshop health station to the workshop leaders, and ask them to instruct and inspect the work of the health station.
    In order to ensure the smooth implementation of the workshop physician system, after a series of mobilizations and deliberations, the existing medical and health organization was adjusted, the leading relationship was unified, and the division of responsibilities was clarified. The adjusted organizational structure is as follows: The health section has one section chief and two deputy section chiefs, responsible for the overall planning and arrangement of health work, and supervising and inspecting the implementation of the plan. In addition, there are four personnel for occupational health and hygiene and epidemic prevention, and one clerk, to assist the section chief in his work. The section chief and one deputy section chief also serve as the hospital director and deputy director, leading the medical and health work of the entire hospital. Another deputy section chief leads the administrative affairs work within the section. The various departments of the outpatient department are led by the directors of each department, and the workshop physicians are led by the director of the internal medicine department, but the administrative work is still directly led by the deputy director of the outpatient department. In this way, the physicians of each department not only have the responsibility of treatment and prevention, but also avoid the phenomenon of mutual evasion of responsibility between the hospital and the health section in preventive work. On the other hand, in conjunction with the actual situation in the plant, a draft plan for the workshop physician system was formulated, and all medical personnel were organized to conduct in-depth discussions. At the same time, the foundry workshop (where the workshops are more concentrated and the workshop leaders pay more attention to health work), which has better objective conditions, was selected as the focus of the experiment, and medical cadres who have a deeper understanding of the workshop physician system and are enthusiastic and willing to work were equipped in order to gain experience. Through these efforts, the specific plan, scope of work, and work steps of the workshop physician system were formally determined, and the responsibilities and routine systems of medical personnel at all levels were clarified. After this plan was reviewed and approved by the administrative department, it was closely linked with administrative cadres at all levels and the trade union and youth league organizations, and extensive publicity work was carried out among the workers, repeatedly explaining the significance and benefits of the workshop physician system.
      When all the conditions were ripe, the workshop physician system was officially implemented in an all-round way in January this year. The specific method is: based on the principle of "focusing on key workshops, key control, and personnel allocation 'taking materials locally'," according to the existing medical force, the size of the workshops, and the quality of the operation situation, the health stations of the workshops were first adjusted and improved. Then, according to the existing medical strength of internal medicine (there are four physicians), combined with the on-site situation, the entire plant was divided into four large workshops (each large workshop includes two or three workshops), and each workshop has a medical assistant health station. The health station only does some first aid and treatment of general diseases. Diseases that cannot be handled by the health station are referred to the hospital outpatient department for treatment. The workshop physician plays a leading role in the entire work. He is the chief person in charge of basic-level medical and health work, but he is mainly responsible for the treatment work of internal medicine outpatient and inpatient departments, as well as the prevention work of the workshops. The workshop physician spends two hours a day working in the ward and two afternoons a week going to the workshop. The rest of the time is entirely in the outpatient department. Going to the workshop is mainly to understand the working environment, the production process, the workshop's health conditions, the workers' working conditions, to investigate and understand the causes of frequent and occupational diseases, to study prevention and control methods, and to be responsible for the business guidance, supervision, and inspection of the health station. The workshop physician basically does not do treatment work at the health station. In the outpatient department, physicians and medical assistants mainly see patients from the workshops they are responsible for. The existing beds in the ward are also managed by the four workshop physicians respectively. For the convenience of work, the ward is also equipped with two medical assistants. One medical assistant is responsible for the beds of two physicians, assisting the physicians in writing medical records, conducting routine examinations, and performing general treatment tasks. Each workshop physician has the responsibility to report his work to the director of internal medicine every week. In this way, not only can the prevention work of the health station be closely combined with the treatment work of the outpatient and inpatient departments through the workshop physician, but also the director of internal medicine can lead the work of the workshop physician more specifically through in-depth investigation and listening to reports. Our workshop physician system is gradually implemented in this situation, adopting the method of learning, researching, and working at the same time.
    Since the implementation of the workshop physician system, the workshop physicians have been able to go to the site at a certain time to guide the work, often understand the workers' working conditions and health environment, and combine the workers' illness to understand the basic factors that harm the workers' health, and analyze and study them, put forward suggestions, and urge improvement. In the first quarter of this year, the workshops put forward 118 suggestions for improving health conditions (including 45 items for preventing and improving high temperature, dust, lighting, illumination, and harmful chemical gases, 13 items for preventing injuries, and 60 items for hygiene, epidemic prevention, and welfare facilities), of which 72 items have been implemented, changing the situation that some workers were harmed by poor working conditions or health environment. For example, after the improvement of the tar tank chimney, the yellow thick smoke containing components such as benzene, asphalt, and ammonium sulfate no longer threatens the health of workers and affects the operation of workers. Secondly, since the workshop medical assistant health station has implemented first aid, workers can receive early treatment in time if they are infected with general diseases or have work-related accidents, and the opportunity to see a doctor has also increased, and the crowding phenomenon in the outpatient department has also changed significantly. Again, since outpatient and inpatient physicians and medical assistants are responsible for the treatment of workers in their respective workshops, patients can receive treatment from a fixed physician from the beginning of the illness, and physicians can also make long-term and systematic observations of patients. Therefore, the physician's sense of responsibility has been strengthened and the treatment effect has been improved. The morbidity rate and the rate of absenteeism due to illness and injury of workers in various workshops have also been greatly reduced, and seasonal and frequent diseases have also decreased.
    In the process of promoting the workshop physician system, the ideology and work style of the general medical staff have also undergone significant changes. Many medical staff have actively requested to devote themselves to this work. In addition to cooperating with physicians in diagnosis and treatment work, the nurse team of the outpatient department also does waiting room publicity and education work in a timely manner without affecting the work, so that workers can get some health knowledge anytime and anywhere. Now, in the minds of every medical staff, "going to the workshop" has become an extremely honorable thing. The general staff also realize that cooperating with the workshop physician to do a good job in medical and preventive work is an unavoidable responsibility.
    These achievements have made leaders at all levels and the masses of workers in the workshops pay more attention to health work, reversing the previous incorrect views on medical staff. Li Wen, a worker in the repair department, said: "Today's health station is different from before. In the past, after taking medicine home, no one cared about it; but now someone automatically comes to visit at home every day. This is truly serving the people." Some workshop leaders said: "Physicians going to the workshop really serve production. In the future, contact us more if there are problems, and discuss solutions together."
    In the months of promoting the workshop physician system, we have realized that in order to implement this system well, medical staff must: 1. Do preventive work on the basis of seeing outpatient patients, but never fail to do preventive work; 2. Relieve the existing pain of the masses and solve practical problems in order to gain the trust and support of the masses; 3. Keep promises to the masses and do what they say; 4. Strive for the trust and support of leaders at all levels in the workshop; 5. Strengthen the planning of preventive work, and do not turn going to the workshop into a relocation of the outpatient department or mobile medical treatment; 6. Strengthen contact with all parties, such as contact with technical safety personnel and welfare personnel; 7. Integrate with workers in life and rely on workers to solve problems.
    But this does not mean that we have no shortcomings in our work. We still have many shortcomings, mainly: 1. The hospital leaders have not played the role they should have played. They have made more arrangements for workshop work and more principled requirements, but less specific methods and specific assistance. The summary and exchange of experience in various workshops has not been timely enough. In the work of promoting the workshop physician system, there is still a lack of a systematic and unified work method, so that each workshop develops freely in some methods and does its own thing. 2. The workshop health station has not done a good enough job in the statistical work of the incidence of diseases among workshop workers, and it is not timely enough. The workshop physicians are also not good at using these statistical data as a basis for studying and analyzing the causes of the disease. 3. The workshop physicians do not yet understand the significance and implementation steps of chronic disease prevention and control observation. The treatment of chronic diseases is only carried out in isolation in the outpatient department and the health station, so the effect is not great. 4. The workshop physicians are still working alone and have not been able to fully organize and utilize the existing strength of various departments to go deep into the workshop to do preventive work.
    These are all areas that we must continue to study and improve in our future work. I think we will definitely be able to overcome the shortcomings in our work.

    石景山钢铁厂推行车间医师制的初步经验
    石景山钢铁厂卫生课课长  王远明
    石景山钢铁厂职工医院，自去年十二月开始学习和试行苏联工业卫生的先进经验——车间医师制以来，在贯彻“预防为主”的原则和开展医疗预防工作方面取得了初步成绩。
    几年来，石景山钢铁厂的医疗卫生工作有了很大的改进。无论在保护工人身体健康、保证生产任务的完成等方面，都起了一定的作用。但许多医务人员的单纯治疗和单纯预防的观点还很浓厚，医疗工作很少结合患病工人的作业、生活、思想情况进行，只是采用药物或手术疗法，加之医疗组织形式不合理，各科医师进行门诊的方式不好，临床医师对现场生产过程、作业环境不够了解，这就在某种程度上限制了医疗卫生工作对职工身体健康和生产所起的保证作用。一九五三年九月，我们推行了保护性医疗制度，初步克服了以上缺点，使医疗工作由被动变为主动，但问题还没有得到完全解决。因此，在实行保护性医疗制度，做好治疗工作的基础上，进一步贯彻“预防为主”的原则，使医疗卫生工作面向生产、面向车间，就成了我们的一个迫切的任务。根据中央卫生部和中央重工业部卫生处的指示，在苏联专家的指导下，我们研究了苏联工业卫生的先进经验——车间医师制，认识到这是使治疗和预防相结合，贯彻“预防为主”的原则，使优良的医疗技术深入车间，提高医疗预防质量的最优越的组织形式；也是使医务人员明确分工，加强责任心，克服工作中的缺点，做好工业卫生工作的主要方法。于是在去年十二月，便作出了试行车间医师制的决定。
    在准备阶段，各级卫生人员的思想情况是很混乱的，医院领导同志只知道这个制度好，但不知道怎样做。认为既是一件新的工作，又找不到适合本厂情况的具体实施办法，在试行工作中一定要走弯路，表现了信心不足。一部分过去曾下过车间的医师认为，这次还是那一套，恐怕仍然不受欢迎，不如搞搞治疗算了；而且认为内科现有医师、医士大部分是女同志，让她们下车间和工人打成一片是有困难的。至于一般医务人员则认为车间领导干部重视生产，不重视卫生工作，他们不支持医务人员所提出的建议，所以，要搞好卫生工作，必须有专门的卫生机构和专门人员。还有的认为劳动卫生、卫生防疫工作是公共卫生专家的事，不是临床医师的事；现在病号多，门诊工作忙，医务人员很难抽出时间来搞这一工作，因此不可能搞出成绩来。而各车间的各级领导干部则认为，医务人员下现场没有好事，不是“挑毛病”，就是“出难题”、“添麻烦”，什么通风、照明、采光、换气，指手划脚地提一大堆意见，弄得无法应付。工人们则认为医师下车间还不是那一套，早就领教过了：不解决问题。
    为了清除上述的思想障碍，我们一方面在医务人员中进行思想动员，同时用具体事例批判部分医务人员的错误认识，教育大家认识做好车间卫生工作的关键在于医务人员的工作态度，工作方法和决心；另一方面又用具体事例和算细账的办法向各车间各级领导人员讲明卫生工作和生产的密切关系，并针对医务人员过去工作中的缺点，通过重点试验，采用以下几种方法，扭转了车间领导方面对卫生工作的认识。第一，主动解决车间病人看病的问题。在看完门诊病人的基础上作预防工作，而不单纯搞预防。同时在治疗时就向患者宣传所患疾病的原因和防治办法，以引起职工的注意，和树立医务人员的威信。第二，在下车间初期，通过发动群众解决一部分影响职工健康而又较容易解决的问题，如改善环境卫生，改良生产工具等，并将改善后的情况向车间领导方面汇报，以引起领导人员的重视，从而取得他们的支持。第三，减轻现场领导方面照顾伤病员的负担。车间保健员主动访问患病工人，并将访问情况反映给车间领导人员。这样，病人感到领导方面的关怀；领导方面则感到保健员确实解决问题。第四，定时向车间领导方面汇报车间保健站的工作情况，并请其指示和检查保健站的工作。
    为了保证车间医师制的顺利推行，在经过一系列的动员、酝酿后，又调整了现有的医疗卫生组织机构，统一领导关系，明确职责分工。调整后的组织机构是这样的：卫生课设课长一人，副课长二人，负责卫生工作的全面计划和布置，督导和检查计划的执行。另设劳动卫生、卫生防疫人员四人，文书一人，协助课长进行工作。课长和一位副课长兼医院院长、副院长，领导全院的医疗卫生工作。另一副课长领导课内的行政事务工作。门诊部各科由各科主任负责领导，车间医师则由内科主任领导，但行政工作仍由门诊副院长直接领导，这样使各科医师不但负有治疗和预防的责任，同时也避免了医院和卫生课在预防工作方面的互相推诿的现象。另一方面结合厂内的实际情况拟定了车间医师制试行草案，组织全体医务人员进行深入讨论。同时选择客观条件较好的铸造车间（车间比较集中，车间领导方面对卫生工作比较重视），作为重点试验，配备对车间医师制领会较深，热情肯干的医务干部，以便取得经验。通过这些工作，正式确定了车间医师制的具体方案和工作范围、工作步骤，并进行了各级医务人员的明确分工，制定出职责范围和常规制度。当这一方案经过行政方面审核批准后，又和各级行政干部以及工会、青年团组织取得密切联系，在工人中广泛地进行宣传工作，反复说明车间医师制的意义和好处。
      一切条件成熟了，于今年一月间，正式全面推行了车间医师制。具体作法是：在按车间重点配备，重点掌握，和人员配备“就地取材”的原则下，根据现有的医疗力量，车间大小、作业情况的优劣，首先调整和健全了各车间的保健站。接着根据内科现有的医疗力量（有四个医师），结合现场情况，把全厂分为四个大车间（每一大车间包括两个或三个车间），每个车间设有医士保健站。保健站只做一些初疗救护及一般疾患的治疗工作，保健站不能处理的疾病，则介绍到医院门诊部治疗。车间医师在整个工作中起着主导作用，他是基层医疗卫生工作的总负责人，但他主要是负责内科门诊和病房的治疗工作，以及车间的预防工作。车间医师除每日有两小时下病房工作，每星期有两个下午下车间，其余时间完全在门诊部。下车间主要是了解作业环境，生产过程，车间卫生状况，工人劳动条件，调查和了解发生多发病、职业病的原因，研究防治办法，以及负责对保健站的业务指导和督促、检查等。车间医师到保健站基本上不作治疗工作。在门诊部，医师、医士主要是看自己所负责的车间的病人。病房现有病床也交由四个车间医师分别管理。为了工作的便利，病房还配备了两名医士，一个医士负责两个医师所负责的病床，协助医师缮写病历，进行常规检查和执行一般的治疗任务。每一个车间医师有责任每周向内科主任汇报工作。这样，不仅通过车间医师能真正把保健站的预防工作和门诊、住院的治疗工作密切结合起来，而且使内科主任通过深入调查和听取汇报，能够更具体地领导车间医师工作。我们的车间医师制就是在这样的情况下，采用边学、边研究、边作的方式逐步推行的。
    试行车间医师制以来，车间医师都能按照一定时间到现场指导工作，经常了解工人的作业条件，卫生环境，并结合工人患病情况，了解危害工人健康的基本因素，并加以分析研究，提出建议，督促改善。今年第一季度内，各车间便提出一百一十八项改进卫生条件的建议（属于防止和改善高温、粉尘、采光、照明及有害化学气体等的有四十五件，防止外伤事故的有十三件，卫生防疫、福利设施的有六十件），其中七十二件已付诸实施，改变了一部分工人因作业条件或卫生环境不良而受到健康损害的状况。如焦油槽烟筒改善后，含有苯、沥青、硫氨等成分的黄色浓烟不再威胁工人的健康、影响工人的操作了。其次，由于车间医士保健站实行了初疗救护，工人感染了一般疾病，或发生工伤事故，都能及时得到早期治疗，并且增加了看病的机会，门诊的拥挤现象也随着有了显著的改变。再次，由于门诊、住院医师、医士分别负责所辖车间工人的治疗工作，使患者能从发病开始就得到固定的医师治疗、医师也能对患者作长期的、系统的观察，因而医师的工作责任心加强了，治疗效果也提高了。各车间工人罹病率和因病伤休工率也大大降低，季节病、多发病也减少了。
    在推行车间医师制的过程中，一般医务人员的思想和工作作风也有了显著的改变。许多医务人员主动地要求投身于这一工作。门诊部的护士小组除了配合医师作诊查和治疗工作外，并在不影响工作的情况下，适时地作候诊宣传教育工作，使工人随时随地都能得到一些卫生常识。现在，在每个医务人员的思想中，“下车间”已成为极荣誉的事。一般工作人员也认识到配合车间医师制作好医疗预防工作，乃是不可旁贷的责任。
    这些成绩已使车间各级领导人员和工人群众对卫生工作更加重视，扭转了过去对医务人员的不正确的看法。修理部工人李文说：“如今的保健站和以前不一样了，过去拿了药回家，就没有人管了；可是现在每天还有人自动地到家里来访问，这才是真正为人民服务呢。”有的车间领导人员说：“医师下车间真正作到了为生产服务，以后有问题多和我们联系，共同商量解决。”
    推行车间医师制的几个月中间，我们体会到，要很好地推行这一制度，医务人员必须做到：一、要在看完门诊病人的基础上作预防工作，但决不能不作预防工作；二、为群众解除现有的疾病痛苦，解决实际问题，以取得群众的信赖和拥护；三、对群众守信用，说了一定去作；四、争取车间各级领导人员的信赖和支持；五、加强预防工作的计划性，不要把下车间变成门诊搬家或巡回医疗；六、加强和各方面的联系，如和技术安全人员、福利人员的联系；七、和工人在生活上打成一片，依靠工人解决问题。
    但这并不是说我们在工作中没有缺点，我们的缺点还是不少的，主要的有：一、医院领导方面还没有起到应有的作用，对车间工作的布置，原则性的要求比较多，具体办法和具体帮助比较少，对总结和交流各车间的经验作得不够及时；在推行车间医师制的工作中，还缺乏系统的统一的工作方法，以致各车间在某些方法上自由发展，各搞一套。二、车间保健站对车间工人发病率的统计工作做得还不够好，不够及时，车间医师也还不善于利用这些统计资料，作为研究和分析发病原因的依据。三、车间医师对慢性病防治观察的意义和进行步骤还不了解，对慢性病的治疗工作，只是在门诊部和保健站孤立地进行，因此收效不大。四、车间医师还只是单枪匹马地工作，未能充分组织和利用各专科现有力量，深入到车间去作预防工作。
    这些，都是我们在今后的工作中必须继续研究改进的，我想，我们也一定能够克服我们工作中的缺点。
