Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 23rd: Premier Zhou Enlai of the People's Republic of China, accompanied by Deputy Premier and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the German Democratic Republic (GDR), Bolz, and Director of the Protocol Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Thun, paid a visit to Premier Grotewohl of the German Democratic Republic at 4:30 PM on the 23rd.

Accompanying Premier Zhou Enlai were Zhang Wentian, Wang Bingnan, Lei Renmin, Qiao Guanhua, Chen Jiakang, and others. Ji Pengfei, the Ambassador of the People's Republic of China to the German Democratic Republic, also accompanied him.

When Premier Zhou Enlai arrived at the building of the Council of Ministers, the band played the national anthems of the People's Republic of China and the German Democratic Republic. Following this, Premier Zhou Enlai reviewed the guard of honor.

Premier Zhou Enlai met with Premier Grotewohl in the Premier's office of the German Democratic Republic. Present were also: Loch, Schultz, Matern, Sydow, Ebert, Honnecker, as well as other government officials of the German Democratic Republic and leaders of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany.

Premier Zhou Enlai delivered the following speech: Respected Premier, dear comrades and friends:

On my way back from the Geneva Conference, I am deeply pleased and honored to be able to visit the German Democratic Republic for three days at the invitation of Comrade Otto Grotewohl, Premier of the German Democratic Republic, and to have the opportunity to meet with all of you friends today.

The Geneva Accords on the restoration of peace in Indochina have brought an end to eight years of war in that part of Asia, a victory for peace. It proves once again that the people's will to strive for peace is invincible, and the national rights of all peoples to demand independence and unity cannot be erased.

The restoration of peace in Indochina has further eased international tensions and opened the way for negotiated solutions to other major international issues.

The government and people of the German Democratic Republic, like other peace-loving countries and peoples in the world, have consistently shown deep concern and warm support for the Geneva Conference. This concern and support has often given us strength and increased our confidence.

There is a deep friendship between the peoples of China and Germany. In the past five years, the economic and cultural relations between the People's Republic of China and the German Democratic Republic have developed substantially. The increasing trade volume in the Sino-German trade agreement is helping the peaceful construction and upward development of the economic lives of our two countries. Frequent and growing cultural exchanges are further enhancing the peaceful friendship between the Chinese and German peoples. I firmly believe that the establishment and development of economic and cultural relations between the People's Republic of China and the whole of Germany not only meet the interests of our two peoples, but also benefit world peace.

The Chinese government and people are deeply concerned about and fully support the just struggle of the German people to achieve peaceful settlement of their national unification issue. On behalf of the government and people of the People's Republic of China, I would like to wish you new achievements in leading the construction cause of the German Democratic Republic and in uniting the entire German people to build a unified, independent, democratic and peace-loving Germany.

I wish the development and consolidation of the close friendship between China and Germany! I wish the German Democratic Republic national prosperity and the people prosperity, and I wish the Premier good health and success in his work!

Premier Grotewohl delivered the following reply: Respected Premier, dear Chinese friends:

On behalf of the government and people of the German Democratic Republic, I extend to you, Premier, and to the government personnel of the People's Republic of China accompanying you, a heartfelt welcome.

Please accept our deepest thanks and sincere pleasure for your friendly visit to the German Democratic Republic.

Through you, we pay tribute to the great and courageous Chinese people. The Chinese people are using all their strength and creative talents to build their new people's democratic system, and have achieved great successes in both international and domestic affairs on this path. The German people admire and watch the heroic efforts made by the Chinese people. Under the leadership of the great Mao Zedong and the Communist Party, they are striving to change their motherland into a modern socialist industrialized country.

The German people attach great importance to the achievements of the People's Republic of China in peaceful economic construction and the progress it has made in economic, social, and cultural fields.

These achievements reflect the peace-oriented policy of the new China, which arises from the essence of a people's democratic country and is different from any policy that is keen on aggression and occupation.

The government and people of the German Democratic Republic are very pleased to see the remarkable and effective efforts made by the socialist Soviet Union to include the People's Republic of China among the powerful countries. Today, there is no force in the world that can solve international problems without the participation of the great People's Republic of China.

In the history of our nation, this is the first time that their Premier has met in the German capital as representatives of two equal countries, thus making their common goals—peace, friendship, and democracy—more firm.

The existing relations between our two peoples are relations of genuine friendly cooperation.

American and West German imperialists are trying to impose military alliances and treaties on the people of West Germany, which will oppress the people of West Germany for many years and put the world in danger of a new war. But the German people reject this policy. They are increasingly closely united around the German Democratic Republic and are fighting with all their strength for the peace and unity of their homeland.

In this struggle, respected Premier, you have given the German people great help and support. The results you achieved at the Geneva Conference are an undeniable victory that the world peace camp has been striving for.

At Geneva, you were not only the spokesperson for the Chinese people and the peoples of Asia, but also the spokesperson for the peoples of Europe, especially the German people. The words of our common friend, Comrade Malenkov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, have been confirmed before the whole world, that is, there is now no international problem that cannot be solved through negotiations.

Your effective efforts to maintain peace will give new hope and confidence to the German people who are fighting for the vital issues of their nation. In the near future, the German question can also be resolved through peaceful negotiations.

Premier, during your stay in our country, you will be accompanied by the sincere congratulations and welcome of the government and people of the German Democratic Republic.

Your visit to the German Democratic Republic will further consolidate and deepen the sincere friendship between our two peoples.

Premier Zhou Enlai left Premier Grotewohl's office at 5:00 PM.

    周恩来总理拜会格罗提渥总理
    【新华社柏林二十三日电】中华人民共和国总理周恩来在二十三日下午四时三十分，在德意志民主共和国副总理兼外交部部长博尔茨和外交部交际司司长图恩陪同下，拜会德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥。
    随同周恩来总理前往的有张闻天、王炳南、雷任民、乔冠华、陈家康等。中华人民共和国驻德意志民主共和国大使姬鹏飞也陪同前往。
    周恩来总理到达部长会议大厦时，乐队奏中华人民共和国和德意志民主共和国国歌。接着，周恩来总理检阅了仪仗队。
    周恩来总理在德意志民主共和国总理办公室会见了格罗提渥总理。在场的还有：洛赫、舒尔茨、马特恩、希德万、艾柏特、昂纳克，以及其他德意志民主共和国政府和德国统一社会党的负责人。
    周恩来总理致辞如下：敬爱的总理同志，亲爱的同志们和朋友们：
    在日内瓦会议后返国的路上，承德意志民主共和国总理奥托·格罗提渥同志的邀请，得以在民主德国作三天的访问，今天并有机会与诸位朋友见面，我深深感到愉快和荣幸。
    日内瓦会议关于恢复印度支那和平的协议，使在亚洲这一部分地区连续八年的战祸得以平息，这是和平的胜利。它又一次证明，人民争取和平的意志是不可战胜的，各国人民要求独立和统一的民族权利是不能抹煞的。
    印度支那和平的恢复进一步缓和了国际紧张局势，并为协商解决其他重大国际问题开辟了道路。
    德意志民主共和国政府和人民正如世界爱好和平的其他国家和人民一样，对于日内瓦会议一贯地表现了深切的关怀和热烈的支持，这种关怀和支持经常使我们获得力量并增加信心。
    中德两国人民有着深厚的友谊。过去五年来中华人民共和国和德意志民主共和国之间的经济和文化关系更有了长足的发展。中德贸易协定中增长着的贸易数额，正帮助着我们两国的和平建设和经济生活的向上发展。经常的和日益发展的文化交流，更使中德两国人民的和平友谊日益增强。我深信，中华人民共和国与德意志全国建立和发展经济、文化关系，不仅符合我们两国人民的利益，而且也有利于世界的和平。
    中国政府和人民十分关切和全力支持德国人民为争取和平解决自己的国家统一问题的正义斗争。我谨代表中华人民共和国政府和人民祝你们在领导德意志民主共和国的建设事业中，在团结全德人民建立一个统一、独立、民主和爱好和平的德国的事业中，获得新的成就。
    祝中德两国亲密友谊的发展和巩固！祝德意志民主共和国国家繁荣，人民兴旺，并祝总理同志身体健康，和在工作中的成就！
    格罗提渥总理致答辞如下：尊敬的总理同志，亲爱的中国朋友们：
    我代表德意志民主共和国政府和人民衷心地欢迎您总理同志及陪同您的中华人民共和国的政府人员。
    我请您接受我们对于您在德意志民主共和国的友好访问所表示的深厚谢意和真诚的愉快。
    通过您，我们向伟大而勇敢的中国人民致敬。中国人民正在以一切力量和创造性的才能，从事于建设他们新的人民民主制度，而且在这条道路上，在国际和国内方面都已获得了巨大的成就。德国人民敬佩地注视着中国人民所作的英勇努力。他们在伟大的毛泽东和共产党的领导下，正在争取改变其祖国为一现代社会主义工业化的国家。
    德国人民对中华人民共和国在和平经济建设中的成绩，以及在经济、社会、文化各方面所获得的进展，都寄以巨大的关怀。
    这些成就反映了新中国以和平为目的的政策，这种政策是从一种人民民主国家的本质中所产生的，它不同于任何一种热中于侵略和占领的政策。
    德意志民主共和国政府和人民非常满意地看到社会主义苏联为了使中华人民共和国列入强国之中所作的卓著成效的努力。今天在世界上已经没有一种力量能在没有伟大的中华人民共和国参加之下来解决国际问题。
    在我们民族的历史上，这还是第一次，这就是：由他们的总理作为两个平等国家的代表，在德国首都相见，从而使他们的共同目的——和平、友好、民主——更加坚定。
    我们两国人民间现有的关系是真正友好合作的关系。
    美国和西德帝国主义者企图把军事联盟和条约强加在西德人民身上，这些军事联盟和条约将长年压迫西德人民，并使世界陷入新战争的危险中。但是德国人民拒绝这种政策。他们日益紧密地团结在德意志民主共和国的周围，并以全力为其祖国的和平与统一而斗争。
    在这个斗争中，尊敬的总理同志，您给了德国人民巨大的帮助和支持。您在日内瓦会议上所取得的成果是世界和平阵营所一直在争取着的不可漠视的胜利。
    您在日内瓦不仅是中国人民和亚洲各国人民的发言人，而且也是欧洲各国人民特别是德国人民的发言人。我们共同的朋友苏联部长会议主席马林科夫同志所说的话，已在全世界面前获得了证实，这就是：现在没有任何国际问题不可以通过谈判途径来求得解决。
    您为维护和平所作的成效巨大的努力，将给为其民族切身问题而斗争的德国人民以新的希望和信心。在不久的将来，德国问题也能通过和平谈判的途径获得解决。
    总理同志，您在我们国家逗留的这一段期间内，伴随着您的将是德意志民主共和国政府和人民的真挚祝贺与欢迎。
    您在德意志民主共和国的访问将更进一步地巩固与加深我们两国人民间的真诚友谊。
    周恩来总理在下午五时离开格罗提渥总理办公处。
