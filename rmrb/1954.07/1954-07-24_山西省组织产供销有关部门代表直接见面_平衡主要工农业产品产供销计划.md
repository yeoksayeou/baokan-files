    Shanxi Province Organizes Direct Meetings Between Representatives of Production, Supply, and Sales Departments
    Balancing Production and Supply Plans for Major Industrial and Agricultural Products
    Recently, the Financial and Economic Committee of the Shanxi Provincial People's Government completed the work of balancing the production and supply of ten major industrial and agricultural products in the province. Through this balancing, the province will increase its coal production by more than 1.2 million tons, iron pyrite and lump sulfur by nearly 10,000 tons, and other industrial products will also be appropriately increased. At the same time, the principle of local industry using local materials has been further implemented, preventing possible overstocking of individual products.
    Shanxi Province's work on balancing the production and supply of major industrial and agricultural products began in March. The Financial and Economic Committee of the Provincial People's Government organized more than 200 cadres from the province, cities, and special districts' financial and trade departments to participate in this work. When balancing each product, they organized representatives from the relevant production, supply, and sales departments to meet directly and study together. In this way, the plans formulated are in line with the actual situation in all aspects of production, supply, and sales, and the phenomenon of separation between production, supply, and sales that occurred at the beginning of the year when compiling the annual local industrial production plan due to insufficient coordination between production, supply, and sales departments was basically eliminated. For example, Shanxi Province is one of China's major coal-producing areas, and this year, due to the rapid development of industrial construction, the state requires a large quantity of coal. However, in the past, the coal sales department did not understand the actual production capacity of local coal mines in the province, and the purchase and transfer plans had not been finalized, which affected coal production. After conducting in-depth investigations into the actual production situation and possible increase conditions of more than 40 local state-owned coal mines and more than 1,000 small coal kilns throughout the province, and under the principle of adapting to national needs and protecting national resources, the coal production increase plan was determined. The Shanxi Branch of the China Coal Industry Building Materials Company also re-formulated its purchase and transfer plan based on the increased production plan. Because of insufficient understanding of the demand for sulfur products in other regions in the past, the province's lump sulfur and pyrite were in short supply, while sulfur powder had a lot of inventory. After this balancing, it was determined that sulfur powder production should be appropriately reduced, while iron pyrite and lump sulfur production should be increased by more than 9,900 tons.
    Due to the disconnection between production and supply plans, the Datong Leather Factory had previously purchased a large number of sheepskins from Ningxia, Qinghai, and Inner Mongolia, while the Shanxi Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative Union purchased a large number of sheepskins from the province and sold them to other provinces. After organizing representatives from the Datong Leather Factory and the Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative Union to meet, they signed an agreement for the Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative Union to supply 25,000 to 30,000 sheepskins, basically meeting the production needs of the Datong Leather Factory. After this balancing work, starting from the third quarter, the proportion of local tobacco leaves used by the Taiyuan Tobacco Factory will increase from 15% to 20% to 30% to 40%. This not only solves the problem of overstocking of tobacco leaves in the province, but also reduces the production cost of each carton of Shunfeng brand cigarettes by more than 36,000 yuan while ensuring quality.

    山西省组织产供销有关部门代表直接见面
    平衡主要工农业产品产供销计划
    山西省人民政府财政经济委员会最近完成了全省十种主要工农业产品的产供销平衡工作。经过这次平衡，全省今年将增产煤一百二十多万吨、硫化铁矿和硫磺块近万吨，其他工业产品也将适当增产；同时进一步贯彻了地方工业就地取材的方针，防止了个别产品可能造成的积压。
    山西省这次主要工农业产品的产供销平衡工作从三月间就已开始。省人民政府财政经济委员会组织了省、市、专区财经贸易等部门的干部二百多人参加这一工作。他们每进行一种产品的平衡时，组织产供销有关部门的代表直接见面，共同研究。这样，订出的计划切合目前产供销各个环节上的真实情况，基本消灭了今年年初编制全年地方工业生产计划时由于生产、供应和销售部门相互配合不够所产生的产供销脱节的现象。如山西省是我国主要煤炭产地之一，今年由于工业建设的迅速发展，国家需要煤的数量很大。但过去煤炭销售部门不了解全省地方煤矿工业的实际生产能力，收购、外调计划一直没有作最后肯定，影响煤的增产。这次深入地调查了全省四十多个地方国营煤矿和一千多个小煤窑的实际生产情况和可能增产的条件后，在适应国家需要和保护国家资源的原则下，确定了煤炭的增产计划。中国煤业建筑器材公司山西分公司也根据增产计划重新制订出收购、外调计划。由于过去对外地需要硫磺产品的情况了解不够，省内所产硫磺块和硫铁矿供不应求，而硫磺粉则有不少积压；经过这次平衡，确定硫磺粉适当减产，硫铁矿和硫磺块则增产九千九百多吨。
    由于产供销计划的脱节，过去大同皮革厂曾从宁夏、青海、内蒙古等地买进大批羊皮，而山西省供销合作社联合社却收购本省大批羊皮外销他省。这次组织大同皮革厂和省供销合作社联合社双方的代表见面后，订立了由省供销合作社联合社供应羊皮两万五千张到三万张的协议，基本上满足了大同皮革厂生产的需要。经过这次平衡工作，太原烟草厂从第三季开始，采用本省烟叶的比例将由百分之十五到二十提高到百分之三十到四十。这样不但解决了本省烟叶的积压问题，同时使每箱顺风牌香烟的生产成本可在保证质量的前提下降低三万六千多元。（新华社）
