China Peace Committee Cables the French National Peace Council:

To the French National Peace Council:

The Geneva Conference has reached an agreement on restoring peace in Indochina. This is the result of the joint efforts of peace-loving people all over the world, and the French people have made a strong contribution to this struggle. We would like to extend our warm congratulations to the French people on behalf of the Chinese people. We also hope that the people of China and France, as well as the people of the world, will continue to strive together for the thorough implementation of all agreements, so as to restore peace in Indochina and safeguard lasting peace in the world.
