    Tekes, a City on the Grassland

    Tekes City, on the banks of the Tekes River in the upper reaches of the Ili River in Xinjiang, is a young city. The buildings in the city, the willows lining the streets, and the fruit trees in the residents' gardens are at most fifteen years old.

    Since 1949, the People's Government has successively established trade companies, grain bureaus, salt bureaus, post and telecommunications bureaus, people's banks, supply and marketing cooperatives, Xinhua Bookstore mobile stations, people's hospitals, and animal husbandry and veterinary work stations here. Now it is the economic and cultural center of the Tekes grassland. Every year, more than 200,000 jin of wool, more than 100,000 jin of cream, more than 2 million jin of oil crops, and a large number of hides are transported here from agricultural and pastoral areas. Most of these agricultural and pastoral products support industrial construction and supply the needs of people in other regions. In the city's inns, there are often donkey transport teams and mule and horse transport teams traveling to and from Ili, Kashgar, Kuche and other places.

    There are now four schools in the city. In addition to Tekes Junior High School, there are also one Uyghur primary school, one Kazakh primary school, and one Mongolian primary school. There are more than 1,160 middle and primary school students. In the past four years, the number of middle school students has more than tripled, of which 83 percent are young people and teenagers from the Kazakh ethnic group, which has the largest population in the county.

    The most prosperous area of the city is the first ring-shaped street around the central park. On both sides of the street, there are more than 600 various shops such as cloth, department stores, sewing, and leather goods, as well as various handicraftsmen such as blacksmiths, carpenters, shoemakers, and watch repairers. Every day at noon is the most lively time here. Groups of Kazakh, Mongolian, Kyrgyz and other ethnic herders come riding horses from the grasslands. They crowd into trade companies, cooperatives and shops, sell wool, leather and other animal products, and then choose their favorite goods. The daily turnover here is nearly 100 million yuan.

    In the sales department of the trade company, we met a Kazakh youth named Aili Ahamaiti. He sold a sheep and bought a bright red gold velvet clothing material for his fiancée. He told us: Since the Communist Party came, industrial products have gradually become cheaper. In the past, such clothing material could not be bought with the money from three sheep.

    This year, people of all ethnic groups are very satisfied with the work of the trade company. In May, the trade company transported 12,000 jin of tea, 10,000 jin of sugar, and a large number of silks and fabrics here. In order to meet the needs of customers, the four sales departments of cloth, department stores, and local product purchases have increased their service staff. In May, the sales volume of the trade company increased by about 25 percent compared with the same period last year, of which the sales volume of cloth and silk fabrics increased by two to three times more than usual.

    This year, on June 2, the day before the "Eid al-Fitr" festival for the Kazakh, Uyghur, Kyrgyz and other ethnic people who believe in Islam in the local area, the streets of Tekes City were particularly lively. Many residents and herders went to the cinema to watch the Soviet film "Far from Moscow."

    草原城市特克斯

    新疆伊犁河上游特克斯河畔的特克斯城，是个年青的城市。市区的建筑物，夹道的杨柳和居民园中的果树，年代最久的也不过十五年。
    一九四九年以来，人民政府在这里相继设立了贸易公司、粮食局、盐务局、邮电局、人民银行、供销合作社、新华书店流动站、人民医院和畜牧兽医工作站等机构。现在它已是特克斯草原上的经济和文化中心，每年从农、牧业区运到这里的羊毛有二十多万斤、奶油十万多斤、油料作物二百多万斤和大批皮张。这些农、牧业产品大部分支援工业建设和供应其他地区人民生活的需要。在城内旅栈中，经常有往来在伊犁和喀什、库车等地的毛驴运输队和骡马运输队。
    现在城里已设有四所学校。除特克斯初级中学外，还有维吾尔小学、哈萨克小学和蒙古小学各一所。中、小学学生已达一千一百六十多名。四年来，中学学生增加了两倍多，其中百分之八十三是全县人口最多的哈萨克族的青年和少年。
    城市最繁华的地方是围绕中心公园的第一道环形街道。街道两边有布匹、百货、缝纫、皮革等各种商店和铁木、皮靴、钟表修理等各行手工业者六百多户。每天中午是这里最热闹的时刻，成群的哈萨克、蒙古、柯尔克兹等族牧民从草原上纷纷骑马而来，他们拥挤在贸易公司、合作社和商店里，出卖了羊毛、皮革等畜产品后，就选购自己心爱的货物。每天这里的交易额将近一亿元。
    在贸易公司的门市部，我们碰见了一个名叫艾里阿哈买提的哈萨克族青年。他卖了一只羊，买了一身艳红的金丝绒衣料给他的未婚妻。他告诉我们说：共产党来了，工业用品也逐渐便宜了。从前这样的衣料，用三只羊的钱还买不到。
    今年各族人民对于贸易公司的工作都感到非常满意。五月份贸易公司给这里运来了一万二千斤茶叶、一万斤糖和大批的绸缎、布料。为了满足顾主们的需要，布匹、百货、土产收购等四个门市部都增加了服务员。五月份贸易公司的售货额比去年同期约增加了百分之二十五，其中布匹、绸缎门市部比平常增加了两倍到三倍。
    今年在当地信仰伊斯兰教的哈萨克、维吾尔、柯尔克兹等族人民过“开斋节”的前一天——六月二日，特克斯城中的街道上显得格外热闹。许多居民和牧民都到电影院去看了苏联影片
  “远离莫斯科的地方”。
