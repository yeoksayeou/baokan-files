Swimming activities in the capital have gradually become active this year. Since the Beijing People's Swimming Pool opened on June 1st, it has received more than 70,000 visitors. The Summer Palace Swimming Pool also opened on June 5th.

Those who come to swim include workers, office staff, young students, and children accompanied by adults. Many people who did not like swimming in the past are now actively participating. In the shallow pools, you can see many beginners practicing breathing and kicking. In just twenty days, 141,000 swimming physical examination certificates were issued this year. On the first Sunday after the swimming pools opened, more than 10,000 people came to these two swimming pools to exercise.

The facilities at the swimming pools have also been increased and improved this year. The Beijing People's Swimming Pool has added sports equipment such as horizontal bars and parallel bars to the sunbathing area, and also added an above-ground diving platform, less than one meter high, for beginners to practice diving. Warm water shower corridors have been added at the exits of the men's and women's changing rooms. The Summer Palace Swimming Pool has added twenty poolside ladders this year and expanded the men's and women's changing rooms. In order to help swimmers prepare for swimming, the Beijing People's Swimming Pool broadcasts radio calisthenics music at the opening. The Beijing People's Swimming Pool has also established relationships with major universities and middle schools in the capital, trying to arrange time for students to take swimming lessons. Students from various universities often go to the Summer Palace Swimming Pool in groups, and Peking University has also set up many temporary swimming instruction stations inside the swimming pool.

    首都的游泳运动逐渐活跃
    首都人民今年的水上运动已逐渐活跃起来。北京市人民游泳场自六月一日开放以来，已有七万多人次前往游泳。颐和园游泳场也在六月五日开放。
    来游泳的有工人、机关工作人员、青年学生和大人们带领着的儿童。许多从前不爱好游泳的人，今天也积极参加了，在浅水池里可以看到很多初学游泳的人在练习呼吸和打水。今年的游泳体格检查证在短短的二十天内就发售了十四万一千张。在游泳场开放后的第一个星期日，就有一万多人到这两个游泳场来锻炼身体。
    游泳场的设备今年也有了增加和改进。北京市人民游泳场在日光浴场增设了单杠、双杠等体育设备，还添设了一个地上跳台，高度不到一公尺，可供初学跳水的人练习，在男女更衣室出口处增设了温水淋浴走廊。颐和园游泳场今年增设了二十个池边的扶梯，并将男女更衣室扩大了。北京市人民游泳场为使游泳的人们做好游泳前的准备活动，特在开场时播送广播体操的音乐。北京市人民游泳场又和首都各大、中学校建立了关系，尽量安排时间让学生们来上游泳课。颐和园游泳场常有各高等学校的学生集体前往游泳，北京大学还在游泳场内设立了很多临时的游泳指导站。
