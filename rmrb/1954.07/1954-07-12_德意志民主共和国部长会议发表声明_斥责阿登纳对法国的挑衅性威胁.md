Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, July 10th: TASS reports from Berlin on the 9th: The Press Office of the Premier of the German Democratic Republic announced: The Council of Ministers of the German Democratic Republic, based on a motion by Premier Otto Grotewohl, issued the following statement:

    Adenauer's provocative threats against France are aimed at forcing France to ratify the "European Defence Community" treaty. This threat has aroused serious concern throughout the world, especially among the French public. Some say that Germany has learned nothing from past history.

    The German Democratic Republic firmly declares that Adenauer has no right to speak for the German people. His words and actions are diametrically opposed to the efforts of the majority of the German people to strive for peace.

    In Germany, a resolute struggle is taking place between democratic forces and revanchist chauvinists. These chauvinists are guilty of launching two world wars and plunging their own people and the people of Europe into dire straits. Adenauer continues to pursue the policies of the former German imperialism. The democratic forces of the German people resolutely oppose this policy and sincerely strive for the establishment of peaceful and friendly relations with all the peoples of Europe. Such a policy is in the vital interests of the German and French people, and also in the interests of the people of other European countries.

    The Government of the German Democratic Republic is deeply convinced that the call of the German people to establish lasting peace and good-neighborly relations with the French people will promote the growth of democratic forces in West Germany and bring peace and security to the two peoples. The democratic forces of the German people will prove to be far stronger than Adenauer's attempt to turn West Germany into a gendarme of Western Europe.

    德意志民主共和国部长会议发表声明
    斥责阿登纳对法国的挑衅性威胁
    【新华社十日讯】塔斯社柏林九日讯：德意志民主共和国总理新闻处宣布：德意志民主共和国部长会议根据奥托·格罗提渥总理的动议发表声明如下：
    阿登纳对于法国的挑衅性的威胁，目的在于迫使法国批准“欧洲防务集团”条约。这种威胁在全世界，特别是在法国公众当中引起了严重的忧虑。有人这样说：德国没有从过去的历史中受到任何教训。
    德意志民主共和国坚决宣布：阿登纳无权代表德国人民说话。他的言行和大多数德国人民为争取和平而作的努力是极端相反的。
    在德国，民主力量和寻求报复的沙文主义者正在进行一场坚决的斗争。这些沙文主义者犯有发动两次世界大战和使他们本国人民和欧洲各国人民陷入水深火热之中的罪行。阿登纳继续执行着前德意志帝国主义的政策。德国人民的民主力量坚决反对这一政策，并且真心诚意地为和全欧洲人民建立和平友好的关系而努力。这样的政策符合德法两国人民的重大利益，并且也符合欧洲其他国家人民的重大利益。
    德意志民主共和国政府深信：德国人民要求和法国人民建立持久和平与和睦的邻邦关系的号召，将能促成西德民主力量的增长，并给两国人民带来和平和安全。德国人民的民主力量将证明它比阿登纳变西德为西欧的宪兵的企图强大得多。
