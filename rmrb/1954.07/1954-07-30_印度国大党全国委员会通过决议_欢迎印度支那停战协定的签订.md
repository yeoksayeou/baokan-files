Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, July 28th: In Ajmer, the All-India Congress Committee passed a resolution on July 26th, welcoming the signing of the Indochina armistice agreement.

The full text of the resolution is as follows:

“The All-India Congress Committee welcomes the signing of the Indochina armistice agreement and congratulates all the national governments which, despite enormous difficulties, have made continuous efforts to finally achieve success for this purpose.

“The end of the seven-year war in Indochina is a major event not only for Asia but also for the whole world. For the first time since the end of the Second World War, peace has been achieved between countries.

“The All-India Congress Committee is convinced that the problems of East and Southeast Asia will then be resolved peacefully, so as to finally end the disastrous conflicts that have devastated some Asian countries and hindered their development.

“The Committee welcomes the declaration that the Indochinese countries will not participate in any military alliance or treaty. In this way, they will become countries that do not participate in any bloc and will strengthen this region of peace as part of a peaceful area.

“The Committee welcomes the five principles agreed between India and China, and between Burma and China, as the basis for their relations. These principles, which include mutual recognition of sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression and non-interference, are applicable elsewhere, and wherever they are implemented, they can become the basis for peaceful coexistence, which the world urgently needs today.

  “The Committee would welcome joint statements by India and other countries based on these principles. The maintenance of peaceful and friendly relations between countries depends on the recognition of the fact that every country has the right to establish its own political and economic structure without external or internal interference in the political and economic structure of other countries. Only on this basis is peaceful coexistence and cooperation possible. Therefore, the Committee welcomes the increasing acceptance of this basis for international relations.

“The recognition of the independence of the Indochinese countries will be welcomed as ending colonial rule in that region of Asia. If this independence had been recognized earlier, the brutal war that ravaged Indochina for seven years would not have occurred.

“The Committee hopes that other colonial regions of the world will make rapid progress towards independence in order to avoid a repeat of the same disaster. Ending colonial rule is essential to the development of peaceful coexistence between nations.

  “The Indochina Accords are a milestone in post-war Asian history, bringing greater responsibility to Asian countries. These countries can only fully fulfill this responsibility by working together and establishing a peaceful region that is not allied with any power bloc in the world.

“The Committee hopes that this Indochina agreement will lead to a relaxation of global tensions and a reduction in the atmosphere of fear and suspicion that surrounds international relations, and will help to create an atmosphere conducive to solving other problems.

“In order to promote this atmosphere of peaceful settlement, it is necessary to avoid taking any steps that are threatening or warning to any country or group, because such steps not only do not contribute to the cause of peace, but will inevitably create suspicion and fear.”

### 印度国大党全国委员会通过决议  欢迎印度支那停战协定的签订

    印度国大党全国委员会通过决议
    欢迎印度支那停战协定的签订
    【新华社新德里二十八日电】在亚日米尔，印度国大党全国委员会七月二十六日通过了一项决议，欢迎印度支那停火协定的签订。
    决议全文如下：
    “印度国大党全国委员会欢迎印度支那停火协定的签订，并对为了这个目的不顾巨大困难、不断进行努力而终于成功的所有国家政府致贺。
    “印度支那七年战争的结束，不仅是亚洲的重大事件，而且是全世界的重大事件。自第二次世界大战结束以来第一次实现了各国之间的和平。
    “印度国大党全国委员会深信，东亚和东南亚问题将接着获得和平的解决，以便最后结束使某些亚洲国家遭受破坏并阻碍它们发展的那种灾祸性的冲突。
    “委员会欢迎关于印度支那国家将不参加任何军事同盟或条约的宣言。这样，它们将成为不参加任何集团的国家，并且将成为和平地区的一部分而加强这个和平地区。
    “委员会欢迎印度和中国之间以及缅甸和中国之间获得协议作为它们的关系基础的五项原则。这些原则包括彼此承认主权和领土的完整、互不侵犯及互不干涉，是可以推广应用到其他地方的，而且这些原则不论在哪里实施，就可以成为和平共处的基础，而和平共处是世界今天所迫切需要的。
      “委员会将欢迎印度和其他国家发表以这些原则为基础的联合声明。国家之间和平和友好关系的维持，取决于对这样的事实的承认，即：每一个国家有权建立它自己的政治和经济结构，不得从外部或内部干涉其他国家的政治和经济结构。只有在这个基础上，和平共处和合作才有可能。因此，委员会欢迎越来越多的人接受这种国际关系的基础。
    “对印度支那国家的独立的承认，将被看作是结束亚洲那个地区的殖民统治，而受到欢迎。如果从前就承认了这种独立，使印度支那遭受七年糜烂的那种残酷战争本来就不会发生的。
    “委员会希望世界其他殖民地区在走向独立方面将获得迅速的进展，以便避免同样灾祸的重演。结束殖民统治，是对国家之间和平共处的发展至为重要的。
      “印度支那协定是战后亚洲历史上的一个里程碑，给亚洲国家带来更大的责任。这些国家只有共同合作并建立一个不与世界任何强权集团联合的和平地区，才能充分地履行这种责任。
    “委员会希望这个印度支那协定将导致全世界紧张局势的缓和以及笼罩在国际关系上的恐惧和猜疑的气氛的减轻，并将有助于创造有利于解决其他问题的气氛。
    “为了促进这种和平解决的气氛，需要避免采取具有对任何国家或集团进行威胁或警告性质的任何步骤，因为这种步骤不但无助于和平事业，而且必然会造成猜疑和恐惧心理。”
