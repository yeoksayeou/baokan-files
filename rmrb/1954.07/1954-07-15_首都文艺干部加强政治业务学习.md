    [Dispatch from this newspaper] To improve the political theory level and artistic cultivation of literary and art workers, some literary and art leading organs and literary and art groups in the capital have begun to take some necessary measures to strengthen the political theory study and literary and art study of literary and art cadres.
    Under the unified leadership of the Party committee, the various literary and art units affiliated with the Ministry of Culture are carrying out political theory studies in a planned way. From October last year to June this year, they studied the Party's general line during the transition period, the resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Party's Central Committee, and part of Chapter Ten of the "History of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of the Soviet Union." Since July 1 this year, all units have turned to the study and discussion of the draft constitution. In the past, some literary and art cadres did not pay attention to the study of political theory, believing that studying political theory would hinder their professional learning. Some Party member literary and art cadres even mistakenly believed that engaging in literary and art work meant they could not participate in Party organizational life. Due to this tendency to detach from politics, many literary and art cadres developed individualistic thoughts and complacency. In some literary and art groups and organs, a liberal atmosphere was strong, often leading to unprincipled disputes and a lack of normal criticism and self-criticism. Many literary and art workers lacked a correct understanding of the cause they were engaged in and a high level of enthusiasm for labor, and instead vulgarly pursued fame and profit, or were passively lazy, often wasting time in "busywork." After studying the general line and the resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session, many literary and art cadres criticized individualistic thoughts, complacency, and other erroneous viewpoints, strengthened unity among themselves, and began to pay attention to studying political theory.
    To urge literary and art cadres to study policies and current events, many literary and art units have held policy and current events quizzes. For example, the Chinese Artists Association, the China Youth Art Theatre, and the Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio have all conducted one or two quizzes. The results of the first quiz by the Chinese Artists Association showed that 60 percent of the cadres failed; the situation had changed during the second quiz, and those who participated basically passed. After conducting two current events quizzes, the China Youth Art Theatre increased the cadres' concern for current events, and now the theater's policy and current events studies are persistently carried out even during busy performance schedules.
    In the past, many literary and art groups and organs did not take effective measures to organize and lead the professional studies of literary and art cadres, so that the artistic cultivation of general literary and art cadres was very poor, and their professional level could not be improved for a long time. In order to change this situation, the China Youth Art Theatre organized a research group to conduct a survey of the theater's seventy-odd actors and, based on the survey results, formulated a plan for carrying out art education work this year. Since March of this year, the theater's art study activities have been unfolded in a planned way. In addition to the actors' physical training, Mandarin practice, and other basic training being conducted regularly, the theater has held art lectures, established an "Actors' Home" organization, and held some film and drama observation meetings. Art lectures are held every two weeks, mainly given by experts, supplemented by reading and discussion. The content of the lectures includes dramatic literature, theories of performing arts, famous Chinese and foreign classical literary works, etc., and are combined with the rehearsal of "Uncle Vanya" to study Chekhov's works. "Actors' Home" is a mass organization of actors that often holds poetry recitation meetings, creative experience exchange meetings, organizes actors to meet with audiences, and organizes small-scale music and painting appreciation meetings, etc. The professional study of art cadres at the Beijing People's Art Theatre combines literary and art theory with selected readings of famous works, mainly focusing on the works of Gorky. Since April this year, the Central Experimental Opera Theatre has begun to study the basic theory of socialist realism creation and to discuss and study it in connection with problems in professional study. Lectures are held once a month. More responsible professional cadres of the theater also conduct discussions on important issues in literary and art creation, such as the issue of typicality and the issue of portraying positive characters. In addition, the theater plans to hold two to three lectures on literary and art knowledge this year.
    In order to help literary and art workers in the capital understand modern Chinese history and have a more comprehensive understanding of the achievements of China's economic construction, the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles has held lectures on "Modern Chinese History" and some reports on China's economic construction, and will continue to hold lectures on modern literature and art, philosophy, and so on in the future.

### 首都文艺干部加强政治业务学习

    首都文艺干部加强政治业务学习
    【本报讯】为提高文艺工作者的政治理论水平和文艺修养，首都一部分文艺领导机关和文艺团体已开始采取一些必要的措施，加强文艺干部的政治理论学习和文艺学习。
    中央文化部所属各个文艺单位，在党委的统一领导下，正有计划地进行政治理论学习。从去年十月到今年六月，学习了党在过渡时期的总路线和党的四中全会决议以及“联共（布）党史”第十章的一部分。从今年七月一日起，各单位已转入宪法草案的学习和讨论。有些文艺干部过去不重视政治理论学习，认为学习政治理论会妨碍学习业务。有些党员文艺干部甚至错误地认为要搞文艺就不能过党的组织生活。由于这种脱离政治的倾向，不少文艺干部中滋长着个人主义思想和骄傲自满情绪。在有些文艺团体、文艺机关中，自由主义空气浓厚，经常闹无原则纠纷，缺乏正常的批评和自我批评。不少文艺工作者缺乏对自己所从事的事业的正确认识和高度的劳动热情，而庸俗地追求名利，或者消极懒散，常常把时间浪费在“无事忙”中。经过总路线和四中全会决议的学习后，不少文艺干部批判了个人主义思想、骄傲自满情绪以及其他的错误观点，加强了相互间的团结，并开始注意学习政治理论。
    为了督促文艺干部对政策、时事的学习，许多文艺单位曾举行政策、时事测验。如中国美术家协会、中国青年艺术剧院和中央新闻纪录电影制片厂等单位，先后都作了一、二次测验。中国美术家协会第一次测验的结果，百分之六十的干部不及格；第二次测验时，情况已有改变，参加测验者基本上都及格。中国青年艺术剧院进行两次时事测验后，提高了干部对时事的关心，现在剧院的政策、时事学习，在繁忙的演出工作中也坚持进行。
    许多文艺团体和文艺机关过去没有采取有效办法组织和领导文艺干部的业务学习，以致一般文艺干部文艺修养很差，业务水平长期不能提高。为了改变这种状况，中国青年艺术剧院曾组织了一个调查研究小组，在剧院七十几个演员中作了一次调查，根据调查的情况，制定了今年进行艺术教育工作的计划。从今年三月起，剧院的艺术学习活动，已有计划地展开。除演员的身体训练、国语练习等基本训练经常进行外，剧院举办了艺术讲座、成立了“演员之家”的组织和举行了一些电影、戏剧的观摩会。艺术讲座每两周举办一次，以专家讲授为主，辅以阅读和讨论。讲座的内容包括戏剧文学、表演艺术理论、中外古典文学名著等，并结合排演“万尼亚舅舅”，学习契诃夫作品。“演员之家”是一个演员群众性的组织，它经常举办作品朗诵会、创作经验交流会，组织演员与观众见面，组织小型的音乐、绘画欣赏会等。北京人民艺术剧院的艺术干部业务学习，是把文艺理论与名著选读结合起来进行的，选读作品以高尔基的著作为主。中央实验歌剧院从今年四月起，开始学习关于社会主义现实主义创作的基本理论，并联系业务学习中的问题，加以讨论研究。每月举办一次讲座。剧院比较负责的业务干部，还对文艺创作中的重要问题进行讨论。如典型问题、表现正面人物问题等。此外今年剧院还计划举办两至三次文艺知识的讲座。
    中国文学艺术界联合会为帮助首都文艺工作者对我国近代历史的了解并较全面地了解我国经济建设的成就，已举办“中国近代史”讲座和一些关于我国经济建设的报告会，今后还将继续举办近代文学艺术、哲学等讲座。
