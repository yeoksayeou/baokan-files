Bound for China
——A Visit to the Zeran Automobile Factory in Warsaw
Xinhua News Agency Correspondent in Warsaw: Xie Wenqing

    Passing through the last workshop of the Zeran Automobile Factory in Warsaw – the spacious assembly workshop – one can see: on six conveyor belts, each more than 300 meters long, are densely arranged many tall wooden crates. These wooden crates are about two meters high and more than three meters long, and each box is marked with: "Bound for China!"
    This is what I saw when I visited the factory with the Chinese Cultural Delegation on July 5th. Factory Manager Askanas said: "Although automobiles are speechless machines, they can represent the Polish working class's love for the great Chinese people!" The workers packing the boxes were putting the exquisite "Warsaw" brand cars into the crates. I approached them and said: "Thank you to the Polish working class for their help to the Chinese people!" "Helping each other!" A packer with a hammer in his hand raised his voice above the roar of the machines and said: "Although I have never been to China, I believe that at this very moment, in China, a large number of manufactured goods are also being packed into boxes, and those boxes are marked: 'Bound for Poland!' Is that right?" After speaking, he put down his hammer and extended both hands to shake mine firmly.
    After visiting the factory and the factory's hospital and sanatorium, we had a conversation with the manager, the factory Party committee secretary, and more than ten Stakhanovite workers. I wanted to take this opportunity to ask more questions and collect more materials in order to report to the Chinese people the production achievements and happy life of the Polish working class. So, I started chatting with Swierczkow, Jedrak, Bekak, and others. Unexpectedly, I, the interviewer, became the interviewee all of a sudden. They asked me questions one after another: "The first automobile manufacturing plant in China is about to start production, isn't it?"... After asking about industrial construction, they asked about agricultural production, and finally about the weather: "Is it very hot in Beijing now? Is summer in Beijing beautiful? Can rice be planted twice a year in southern China, and should the first harvest be underway now?" They asked me in turn from economic construction to natural scenery, from north to south. Later, taking advantage of their time to light cigarettes, I said, "Now it's my turn to interview you!"
    "Hahaha!" After a burst of laughter, Swierczkow spoke: "Please, please! It should have been your turn to ask us first. But, you know, we are all so eager to learn more about the situation in great China! Usually, when we hear about China, we listen as attentively as children listening to stories. Today, seeing a Chinese friend, we couldn't help but ask you first."
    They introduced the construction, production, labor protection, and cultural life of the Zeran Automobile Factory. The Zeran Automobile Factory is one of the huge factories that began construction in the later period of the People's Poland's Three-Year Plan (1947-1949) for the restoration and development of the economy. Pre-war Poland was simply unable to produce automobiles. The factory's area (production area) is 120 hectares (equivalent to 1,800 mu), equipped with the latest Soviet-made machines and equipment, and the main production processes are automated. The entire construction plan will not be completed until 1955. However, most of the production departments have been built and put into production long ago. The factory's building design and construction, machine installation, etc., were all carried out with the help of the Soviet Union, and many skilled workers were also trained in Soviet automobile factories. Manager Askanas said it well: "Only with the help of the Soviet Union can People's Poland build this rare automobile factory in Europe in a short period of time with 'Warsaw speed' (referring to the speed of restoring and rebuilding Warsaw. Because Warsaw was 85 percent destroyed in World War II, but the construction area has now increased to about three times that before the war, and few cities in the world have been built so quickly, so the Polish people everywhere use this term to describe the rapid progress of things)." Women workers account for more than 25 percent of the workers, and 75 percent of the workers are young people who came from the countryside not long ago. They have improved their culture and technology in the factory's elementary vocational schools, and most of them are now skilled workers. The cultural life of the Zeran Automobile Factory is very rich and diverse, with a total of thirteen amateur cultural groups for drama, dance, music, photography, art, etc. The drama group recently successfully staged a play adapted from the Soviet writer Fadeyev's novel "The Young Guard."
    The factory's labor competition is conducted regularly, and they have changed the "festival-style" (i.e., only conducting surprise competitions before festivals) competition method. The current labor competition is conducted through long-term contracts signed by workers (trade unions) and factory administration. According to the established production plan, cost plan, and quality indicators, the workers propose competition plans to further improve labor productivity, reduce costs, and improve quality, and the administration guarantees to further improve labor conditions and provide material conditions for adopting feasible rationalization proposals. The competition committee composed of both parties periodically checks the implementation of the contract and urges both parties to fulfill the provisions of the contract. Bekak, who talked to us, is the youngest Stakhanovite worker in the factory. He is only twenty-one years old and leads eighteen young workers. When I asked about their plan completion, he was very modest and unwilling to say, but Jedrak answered for him: "Only half a year has passed this year, and they will complete the annual production plan in another week." To illustrate the achievements of the labor competition, Jedrak took out a few photos for me to see. These were photos taken during the "May Day" parade, and everyone wore a cloth strip on their chest with different numbers such as 310%, 250%, 210%... written on them. "This is our labor achievement, I'll give it to you." Jedrak said, signing the back of the photo, and then said, "Use this small gift to pay tribute to the Chinese workers!"
    The old worker Baolieshijin was particularly excited today. He had participated in the International Brigade and fought against the fascists in Spain. There, he met a Chinese friend for the first time in his life, but that friend unfortunately sacrificed. He missed this friend for many years. Seeing us today, he was as happy as seeing his comrades in arms in Spain. He said: Every worker in the Zeran Automobile Factory is proud to be able to manufacture these cars for the Chinese people. The workers not only launched competitions to ensure the timely completion of the order tasks, but also paid special attention to product quality. Every part is carefully inspected, and some are even inspected under a microscope.

    运往中国
    ——华沙泽兰汽车工厂访问记
    新华社驻华沙记者　谢文清
    穿过华沙泽兰汽车工厂的最后一个车间——宽大的装配车间，就可以看到：在六条各长三百多公尺的传送带上，密密地排列着许多高大的木箱。这些木箱约有二公尺高，三公尺多长，每个箱子上都写着：“运往中国！”
    这是七月五日我随中国文化代表团参观这个工厂时看到的。工厂经理阿斯卡那斯说：“汽车虽然是不能说话的机械，但它却能代表波兰工人阶级热爱伟大的中国人民的心！”装箱的工人们正在把精美的“华沙牌”汽车装进箱子去。我走近他们，向他们说：“感谢波兰工人阶级给予中国人民的帮助！”“互相帮助呀！”一位手拿铁锤的装箱工人在机器的轰隆声中放高嗓子说：“我虽然没有到过中国，但我相信：就是在这个时刻，在中国，一定也有大批制成品正在被装进箱里去，那箱上写着：‘运往波兰！’是吗？”说完，他放下铁锤伸出双手同我紧握。
    参观了工厂以及工厂的医院、疗养所后，我们就同经理、工厂党委书记和十多位斯塔哈诺夫工作者在一起交谈。我正要趁此机会多提些问题，多搜集些材料，以便向中国人民报道波兰工人阶级的生产成就和幸福生活。于是，我就同什维尔茨科夫、耶德拉克、贝卡克等攀谈了起来。可是没想到，我这个访问者一下子就成了被访问者，他们几个人你一句、我一句，倒先把问题向我提出来了：“中国的第一汽车制造厂快要开始生产了吧？”……问了工业建设，又问农业生产，末了又问到天气上去了：“北京现在很热吗？北京的夏天很美吗？中国的南部一年不是可以种两次水稻吗，现在第一次该收割了吧？”他们就这样从经济建设到自然风光，从北往南地轮番问我。后来乘着他们点火抽烟的功夫，我说道：“现在该是我访问你们了！”
    “哈哈哈！”一阵哄堂大笑之后，什维尔茨科夫说话了：“请吧，请吧！本该让你先问我们的。不过，你知道，我们每个人是多么想多了解些伟大中国的情况呀！平常，一听到谈中国，我们就像孩子们听故事一样听得入神，今天看见了中国朋友，不由得就先问起你来了。”
    他们介绍了泽兰汽车工厂的建设、生产、劳动保护和文化生活等情况。泽兰汽车工厂是人民波兰在战后恢复和发展经济的三年计划（一九四七—一九四九年）的后期开始建设的巨大工厂之一，战前的波兰根本不能生产汽车。这个工厂的面积（生产面积）有一百二十公顷（合一千八百市亩）大，装备着苏联造的最新式机器和设备，主要生产过程都是自动化的。全部建筑计划要到一九五五年才能完成。但大部分生产部门已经建好而且早已投入生产。工厂的厂房设计和建筑、机器的安装等都是在苏联的帮助下进行的，许多技术工人也是在苏联的汽车工厂实习中培养出来的。经理阿斯卡那斯说得好：“只有在苏联的帮助下，人民波兰才能在短期中用‘华沙速度’（指恢复和重建华沙的速度。因为华沙在第二次世界大战中被毁百分之八十五，但现在建筑面积已增为战前的三倍左右，世界上很少有一个城市曾建设得这样快，所以波兰人民到处都用这个名词来说明事情进展的迅速）建设起这个欧洲少有的汽车工厂。”工人中女工占百分之二十五以上，百分之七十五的工人是不久前从农村里来的青年。他们在工厂的初级职业学校中提高了文化和技术，现在大都成了熟练工人。泽兰汽车工厂的文化生活是十分丰富而多样的，戏剧、舞蹈、音乐、摄影、美术等业余文化团体共有十三个。戏剧组不久前还成功地上演了根据苏联作家法捷耶夫的小说“青年近卫军”改编的剧本。
    工厂的劳动竞赛是经常进行的，他们已改变了“节日式”（即只在节日前进行突击式的竞赛）的竞赛方法。现在的劳动竞赛是通过工人（工会）和工厂行政方面签订长期合同进行的，工人根据已制订的生产计划、成本计划和质量指标等，提出进一步提高劳动生产率、减低成本和改进质量的竞赛计划，行政上保证进一步改善劳动条件，为采纳可行的合理化建议提供物质条件等。由双方组成的竞赛委员会按期检查合同的执行情况，督促双方履行合同中的规定。和我们谈话的贝卡克就是全厂最年轻的斯塔哈诺夫工作者，他才二十一岁，领导着十八个青年工人。当我问到他们完成计划的情形时，他很谦虚，不肯说，还是耶德拉克替他回答道：“今年才刚刚过去半年，再有一个星期他们就将要完成全年的生产计划了。”为了向我说明劳动竞赛的成绩，耶德拉克拿出几张照片给我看，这是他们在“五一”节游行时拍的照片，每个人胸前都佩有一条布带，上面写着完成计划百分之三百一十、二百五十、二百一十……等不同的数字。“这就是我们的劳动成就，送给你吧。”耶德拉克说着就在照片的背面签了名，然后说：“用这点小小礼物向中国工人致敬！”
    包列式金老工人今天特别兴奋，他曾经参加过国际纵队在西班牙同法西斯分子作过战，在那里他生平第一次结识了一位中国朋友，但那位朋友后来不幸牺牲了，他怀念这个朋友许多年了，今天看到我们，就同看见了他在西班牙时的战友一样高兴。他说：泽兰汽车工厂的每个工人，都以自己能为中国人民制造这些汽车感到光荣。工人们不但展开竞赛，保证按期完成订货任务，而且特别注意产品质量，每个零件都经过仔细检查，有的还要放在显微镜下检查。
