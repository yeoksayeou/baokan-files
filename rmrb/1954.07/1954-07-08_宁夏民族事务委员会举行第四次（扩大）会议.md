    Ningxia Nationalities Affairs Committee Holds Fourth (Enlarged) Meeting
    The Nationalities Affairs Committee of the Ningxia Provincial People's Government held its Fourth (Enlarged) Meeting from June 25 to 28. The meeting summarized the nationalities work in Ningxia Province over the past year, determined the tasks for future nationalities work, and discussed the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China.
    The meeting held that: From the spring of 1953 to the end of April 1954 in Ningxia Province, in addition to the establishment of the Mongolian Autonomous Region and the Hedong Hui Autonomous Region, two autonomous regions equivalent to the special district level, the political rights of all ethnic groups were fully taken into account in many grassroots regimes where various ethnic minorities lived in concentrated or mixed communities, further consolidating ethnic unity and enhancing the patriotic enthusiasm and production enthusiasm of all ethnic groups.
    In recent years, the economic and cultural construction of various ethnic minority areas in Ningxia Province has also greatly developed. The number of livestock such as sheep, cattle, horses, and camels in the Mongolian Autonomous Region, the Hedong Hui Autonomous Region, and the Ejin Banner Autonomous Region alone has increased from more than 450,000 in 1949 to more than 1,320,000 in 1953. Mutual aid and cooperation organizations for agricultural production in various ethnic minority areas have also greatly developed. In terms of ethnic education, the province had only 42 Hui and Mongolian primary schools in 1951, but now it has increased to 144, with more than 14,000 middle and primary school students from various ethnic groups.
    The meeting held that it is necessary to further develop various construction projects in ethnic minority areas, continue to cultivate ethnic minority cadres, and consolidate and strengthen the unity between and within ethnic groups.
    At the meeting, when the representatives discussed the draft constitution, they unanimously agreed that the draft constitution fully reflects the wishes and demands of the people of all ethnic groups in the country, and should be widely publicized to the people of all ethnic groups in the future. Ethnic minority representatives at the meeting also specifically pointed out in their speeches that the various provisions in the draft constitution regarding ethnic issues are the fundamental guarantee for gradually developing backward ethnic groups into advanced ethnic groups and gradually transitioning to a socialist society.

    宁夏民族事务委员会举行第四次（扩大）会议
    宁夏省人民政府民族事务委员会在六月二十五日到二十八日举行第四次（扩大）会议。会议总结了宁夏省一年多来的民族工作，确定今后民族工作的任务，并讨论了中华人民共和国宪法草案。
    会议认为：宁夏省在一九五三年春到一九五四年四月底，除建立了蒙古自治区和河东回族自治区两个相当于专区级的自治区外，还在各少数民族聚居和杂居的许多基层政权中，充分照顾到各民族的政治权利，进一步巩固了民族团结，提高了各族人民的爱国热情和生产积极性。
    几年来，宁夏省各少数民族地区的经济和文化建设事业，也有了很大发展。仅蒙古自治区、河东回族自治区和额济纳旗自治区的羊、牛、马、骆驼等牲畜，已由一九四九年的四十五万多头增加到一九五三年的一百三十二万多头。各少数民族地区的农业生产互助合作组织，也有了很大发展。在民族教育方面，一九五一年全省仅有回民和蒙民小学四十二所，现在已增加到一百四十四所，各民族学校的中、小学生已有一万四千多名。
    会议认为今后必须进一步开展民族地区的各项建设工作，继续培养民族干部，巩固和加强民族之间和民族内部的团结。
    会上，代表们在讨论宪法草案时，一致认为：宪法草案充分反映了全国各族人民的愿望和要求，今后要向各族人民广泛地进行宣传。到会的少数民族代表在发言中还特别指出：宪法草案中关于民族问题的各项规定，就是使落后民族逐步发展成为先进民族，逐步过渡到社会主义社会的根本保证。
