The southern section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway passes through nine counties within Mianyang Prefecture, Sichuan Province. Since construction began in the area in June 1952, the people of Mianyang Prefecture have actively and enthusiastically supported "their" railway.

The farmers of Zhaohua County organized many porter teams, water drainage teams, and grain transportation teams, each consisting of dozens to over a hundred people. Liang Qingye, a farmer from Huangsha Township, took the lead in organizing a water drainage team in May of last year and has persisted in supporting the work. Liu Rong'an, the township head of Xin'er Township in Mianyang County and a Communist Party member, motivated the people of the entire township to support the railway construction. Out of the township's population of 10,000, over 7,000 people participated in the construction project at various times. During the emergency repair of the Fu River Bridge, more than 480 farmers from Qingyi Township in Mianyang County voluntarily brought dragon-bone waterwheels to help with draining water and digging the bridge foundation. In September 1953, the Jialing River dried up, and a large number of construction materials could not be transported to the site, threatening to halt work due to lack of supplies. Over 300 local farmers, during the busy autumn harvest season, squeezed out time to help with the emergency transport. Guo Dawan, a 76-year-old farmer, also voluntarily joined the effort, saying, "I'll be satisfied as long as I see the train that I've dreamed about for decades. What does a little effort matter!"

Over the past two years, the people of Mianyang Prefecture have supported the railway with 260,000 railway sleepers and over 30,000 cubic meters of timber. Tang Jiansheng and other farmers from the Second Village of Heming Township in Jiange County sawed over 280 railway sleepers from more than 100 ancestral "Guan Mu cypress trees" and personally delivered them to the construction site. Dong Kaizhi and a dozen others from the Second Village of Baoshi Township in Zitong County spent half a month sawing a total of 76 railway sleepers and sold them to the Railway Bureau.

Felling and transporting railway sleepers from the mountains is difficult. The back mountains of Mianzhu County are abundant in timber, and the snow on the mountains does not melt until May or June. In the past, farmers who collected medicinal herbs only dared to enter the mountains in the summer. However, in order to find railway sleepers, laborers like Yao Zhongli ventured into the mountains in December last year, braving the severe cold and snow. They surveyed trees in one to two feet of snow during the day and stayed in forests and caves at night. Li Mingchao, a farmer from Jiange County, led over 40 farmers to the 2,000-meter-high Ma'ersi Mountain for felling. The mountain was high and the road was narrow and difficult to traverse. They carried the railway sleepers down the mountain one by one. There was a dangerous area on the mountain called "Three Stones," with a deep ravine below and winding "hairy roads." They used round logs to build a pontoon bridge, risking their lives to cross it, and finally transported the timber down the mountain.

The demand for ballast for the Baoji-Chengdu Railway is very high, especially this year when the Jiangyou to Guangyuan section adopted mechanized track laying, the supply increased sharply. To ensure the supply, the Jiangyou County People's Government organized more than 3,700 laborers to rush to hammer stones, achieving "where the track is laid, there is ballast." One squadron increased the average amount of stone hammered per person per day by four times compared to the past. They said, "The railway is our own. Failure to complete the task on time will delay national construction."

Iron factories and blacksmith shops in various parts of Mianyang Prefecture also actively participated in supporting the railway. The Mianyang Local State-Owned Xinhua Machinery Factory alone processed 76.5 tons of iron tools for the Railway Bureau in the past six months. The workers showed great enthusiasm in production. To forge a batch of curved iron plates and connecting iron plates, which was originally planned to take twelve people twenty-five days, the workers improved the operation method and completed it in just nine people and half a month.

Since the railway construction project entered the mountainous area north of Jiangyou, the supply of daily necessities for the construction workers has also become more difficult. State-owned commerce and cooperative commerce in Mianyang Prefecture have expanded the organization of goods and supplies, going deep into the construction sites. Guangyuan Trading Company organized over 2 billion yuan worth of non-staple foods from Cangxi, Langzhong, Xichong, Jiange and other counties in the first quarter, continuously sending them to the construction sites. The Jiangyou County Cooperative organized 40,000 jin of pork in January this year and delivered it to the work areas. In addition to supplying a large amount of general merchandise and cloth, department stores also supplied 14,000 pairs of sunglasses and over 13,000 pairs of rubber shoes, improving the working conditions of the railway construction workers.

    四川省绵阳专区人民热情支援宝成铁路
    通干
    宝成铁路南一段经过四川省绵阳专区境内九个县，从一九五二年六月铁路在该区境内建筑以来，绵阳专区人民就积极热情地支援自己的铁路。
    昭化县农民组织了许多抬工队、放水队、运粮队，每队有几十人到百多人。黄沙乡农民梁青业从去年五月起，就带头组织了放水队，坚持支援工作。绵阳县新儿乡乡长、共产党员刘荣安，带动全乡人民支援筑路，全乡一万人口中先后参加筑路工程的就有七千多人。抢修涪江大桥时，绵阳县青义乡四百八十多个农民自动带了龙骨水车，去帮助车水和挖桥基。一九五三年九月，嘉陵江水枯了，大批筑路器材一时运不到工地，眼看就要停工待料，当地三百多农民在秋收的紧张季节里，挤出时间帮助抢运，七十六岁的老农民郭大万也自动参加抢运。他说：“我只要看到想了几十年的火车就心满意足了，出点力算得了啥！”
    绵阳专区人民两年来支援铁路的枕木达二十六万根和木料三万多立方公尺。剑阁县鹤鸣乡二村农民唐建生等把祖传的一百多根“关坆柏树”锯了二百八十多根枕木，亲自把它送到工地。梓潼县五区宝石乡第二村董开志等十几个人花了半个月时间，一共锯成了七十六根枕木，卖给了路局。
    从山上砍伐和运输枕木是困难的。绵竹县后山是盛产木材的地方，山上的积雪要五、六月份才能化完，过去采药的农民夏天才敢进山。可是为了寻找枕木，民工姚中力等去年十二月冒着严寒风雪进了山，他们白天在一两尺深的积雪中调查树木，夜间宿在森林和岩洞里。剑阁县农民李明朝率领四十多个农民到二千多公尺高的马耳寺山去砍伐，山高路窄不好走，他们就把枕木一根又一根地背下山来。山上有一个险地——“三颗石”，下面是万丈深沟，山路尽是弯弯曲曲的“毛毛路”，他们就用圆木搭成浮桥，冒着生命危险从上面走，终于把木头运下了山。
    宝成铁路道渣的需要量很大，特别是今年江油到广元段采用了机械化铺轨方法，供应量骤然增加。为了保证供应，江油县人民政府组织了三千七百多名民工赶锤石子，做到了“铺轨到那里，那里有道渣”。有一个中队平均每人每天锤石量比过去增加了四倍。他们说：“铁路是自己的，不能按时完成任务，就要耽误国家建设。”
    绵阳专区各地的铁工厂和铁匠炉，也积极参加了支援铁路的工作，只绵阳地方国营新华机械工厂六个月来就替铁路局加工了七十六吨半的铁器工具。工人们在生产中都发挥了高度热情，锻制一批弯形铁板和连形铁板，原计划要十二个人做二十五天，工人们改进了操作方法，只用九个人半个月就完成了。
    自从筑路工程进入江油以北山区后，筑路职工生活必需品的供应也发生了更大的困难。绵阳专区国营商业和合作商业都扩大组织货源，深入工地供应。广元贸易公司在第一季度就从苍溪、阆中、西充，剑阁等县组织了二十多亿元的副食品，源源不断地送到工地去。江油县联社今年一月份组织了四万斤猪肉深入工区供应。百货商店除供应了大量百货布匹外，还供应了风镜一万四千付，胶鞋一万三千多双，改善了筑路民工的劳动条件。
