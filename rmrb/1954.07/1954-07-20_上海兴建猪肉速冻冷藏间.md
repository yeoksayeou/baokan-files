Shanghai Builds Pork Quick-Freezing Cold Storage

In accordance with the needs of the people and export trade, the East China District Company of China Food Company has decided to convert the Dongda Road Cold Storage in Shanghai into a modern pork quick-freezing cold storage. Once completed, the amount of fresh frozen pork processed here each day will be enough for one-third of Shanghai's citizens.

This quick-freezing cold storage will be built according to the Soviet style, with the cold air pipes installed in the space under the roof, and the cold air blown to all corners through twenty blowers. In summer, no matter how hot it is outside, the indoor temperature can still be maintained at about minus ten degrees Celsius. In this way, it will take only twenty-four hours to process fresh pork into fresh frozen pork and send it to the cold storage, and the quality will fully meet the standards.

From July 14th, the quick-freezing, cold storage, and power workshops have been fully started. This project will be completed in early October of this year.

    上海兴建猪肉速冻冷藏间
    中国食品公司华东区公司根据人民及出口贸易的需要，决定将上海东大名路冷风仓库，改建成一座现代化的猪肉速冻冷藏间。建成以后，这里每天加工的冰鲜猪肉，足够上海三分之一市民食用。
    这一座速冻冷藏间将根据苏联式样，把冷气管安装在屋顶下的空隙处，通过二十具鼓风机把冷气吹送到各个角落。夏天，不论室外多么炎热，室内温度仍能保持在零下十度左右。这样，从鲜猪肉加工成冰鲜猪肉，再送进冷藏仓库，只需要二十四小时，而且质量完全合乎标准。
    从七月十四日起，速冻、冷藏、动力车间已全面动工兴建。这一工程将在今年十月上旬完工。
