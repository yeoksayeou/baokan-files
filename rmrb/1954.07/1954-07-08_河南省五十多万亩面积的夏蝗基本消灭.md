    More Than 500,000 Mu of Summer Locusts in Henan Province Basically Eliminated
    Since the outbreak of summer locusts in Henan Province in early May, Party and government leading organs at all levels have successively dispatched large numbers of cadres to go deep into the locust areas to lead the masses in carrying out locust control movements. Great achievements have been made in the past two months. According to incomplete statistics from 27 counties including Yanling, more than 100,000 laborers have been mobilized, more than 2,300 powder sprayers and 6,400 powder dusting bags have been used, and more than 410,000 jin of "666" powder and more than 390,000 jin of wheat bran and grain chaff have been used. Summer locusts on 550,000 mu of land have been basically eliminated. Before prevention and control, all localities imparted locust control techniques and conducted political education to the laborers. In the movement, the enthusiasm of the vast number of cadres and the masses was fully brought into play, and many effective advanced experiences in killing insects were created, saving a lot of manpower and financial resources. For example, after the Xinxiang Locust Control Station successfully tested the use of grain chaff instead of wheat bran to make poisonous bait, more than 60 million yuan was saved on the 40,000 mu of prevention and control area; in Xiping, in areas with sparse locust nymph densities, 20,000 chickens and ducks from chicken and duck raising households were mobilized to be concentrated and taken to designated locations in batches to peck at the locust nymphs. This not only solved the difficulty of lack of labor but also saved a large number of medicines and machinery. At present, the locust control work in most areas has basically ended, and summaries are being made, models are being selected, land is being checked, and plans for autumn locust control are being formulated.

    河南省五十多万亩面积的夏蝗基本消灭
    河南省自五月上旬发生夏蝗以来，各地党政领导机关先后抽调了大批干部，深入蝗区，领导群众开展了治蝗运动，两个月来已取得了很大成绩。据鄢陵等二十七县不完全统计，先后出动民工十万余人，使用喷粉器二千三百多架，撒粉布袋六千四百个，“六六六”粉四十一万多斤，麦麸、谷糠三十九万多斤，五十五万亩夏蝗基本消灭。在防治前各地对民工都传授了治蝗技术和进行了政治教育，在运动中充分发挥了广大干部和群众的积极性，创造出了不少有效的杀虫先进经验，节省了大量的人力和财力。如新乡治蝗站用谷糠代替麦麸拌制毒饵试验成功后，在四万亩防治面积上就节省了六千多万元；西平在蝗蝻密度稀的地方，动员养鸡鸭户集中了二万只鸡子、鸭子，有组织地分批带到各指定的地点啄食蝗蝻，这样不仅解决了缺乏劳力的困难，而且也节省了大批的药械。目前，大部地区治蝗工作已基本结束，正在进行总结、评选模范、查地和制定秋蝗防治计划。  （徐文章）
