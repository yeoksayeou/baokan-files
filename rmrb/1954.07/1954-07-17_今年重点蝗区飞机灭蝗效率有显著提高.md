Aircraft locust control efficiency has significantly improved in key locust areas this year.

The aircraft locust control work carried out in the key locust areas of Xinjiang, Jiangsu, and Anhui provinces this year has seen a significant increase in efficiency. A total of 21 aircraft were dispatched in the three locations, flying continuously for more than a month and treating over 1.2 million mu of land. In Xinjiang, the locust control work was carried out by Soviet experts and engineers, using 17 aircraft and 400 tons of "666" pesticide powder to control locusts in key locust areas in seven special districts, including Yanqi, Tacheng, Urumqi, and Hami. A total of more than 1.1 million mu of prevention and control tasks were completed. In Jiangsu and Anhui key locust areas, the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central Government, the Civil Aviation Administration of the Military Commission, and the local People's Governments jointly dispatched four aircraft, which went to Sihong in Anhui and Guanyun and Xin Hailian in Jiangsu to carry out prevention and control, eliminating 170,000 mu of locust nymphs. In terms of control efficiency, the baiting and killing of soil locusts in Xinjiang reached more than 80%, and the powder poisoning and killing of migratory locusts reached more than 95%. In Jiangsu and Anhui provinces, the powder poisoning and killing of migratory locusts reached 98% to 100%.

During this year's aircraft locust control, thanks to the hard work and research of the staff, work efficiency has also continuously improved. In Sihong County, Anhui, the powder spraying area increased from more than 240 mu per hour at the beginning to more than 1,100 mu, and in Guanyun area, it increased from 580 mu per hour to 1,190 mu. The signal team members worked very hard, getting up at two o'clock in the morning to arrange signals at the construction site. The terrain in the Guanyun locust area is complex, and a ditch must be crossed every 200 meters. The signal team members sometimes have to arrange formations of nine *li* in length. Whenever the wind direction changes, they have to change the formation immediately. The team members were able to change in a timely manner, ensuring the smooth progress of the locust control work. Therefore, during this year's aircraft spraying, there were very few phenomena such as repetition, omission, and intercropping.

    今年重点蝗区飞机灭蝗效率有显著提高
    今年在新疆、江苏、安徽三省重点蝗区进行的飞机治蝗工作，灭蝗效率有显著提高。三处共出动飞机二十一架，连续飞行一个多月治蝗面积达一百二十多万亩。新疆的治蝗工作是由苏联派遣专家和工程师，使用十七架飞机和四百吨“六六六”药粉，在焉耆、塔城、乌鲁木齐及哈密等七个专区的重点蝗区进行除治，共完成一百一十多万亩的防治任务。江苏、安徽重点蝗区是由中央农业部、军委民航局和当地人民政府商定，共派出飞机四架，分头到达安徽的泗洪与江苏的灌云、新海连等地进行防治，共消灭十七万亩蝗蝻。在防治效率上，新疆土蝗区撒饵诱杀达百分之八十以上，飞蝗区撒粉毒杀达百分之九十五以上；江苏、安徽两省飞蝗区撒粉毒杀达百分之九十八到一百。
    今年飞机治蝗中，由于工作人员努力钻研，工作效率也不断提高。安徽泗洪县的喷粉面积由开始时每小时二百四十多亩提高到一千一百多亩，灌云地区由每小时五百八十亩提高到一千一百九十亩。信号队员们的工作很艰苦，夜里两点钟就起身到工地排列信号。灌云蝗区地形复杂，每隔二百公尺就要越过一条水渠，信号队员们有时要排列九华里长的队形，每当风向改变时又要马上改变队形，队员们都能及时变换，保证了治蝗工作的顺利进行，因而今年飞机喷粉时，很少有重复、遗漏、插花等现象发生。
