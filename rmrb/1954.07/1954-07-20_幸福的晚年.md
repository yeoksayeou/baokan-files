Happy Retirement Years

By our reporter Bai Sheng

The Dalian-Lushun Workers' Retirement Home is located at the foot of Nanshan in Siergou, Dalian. Here, it is backed by mountains and faces the sea, with beautiful scenery. The home has a small garden, as well as a canteen, recreation room, clinic, bathhouse, barber shop, auditorium...

In the early morning, as the sun rises, the elderly workers stroll in twos and threes in the small garden, breathing fresh air. Facing the sea breeze, several elderly workers stare into the distance from the windows of their residences; in front of a small earth slope at the entrance of the home, several elderly workers sleep peacefully in lounge chairs.

When I walked into a clean dormitory, Zhang Shaoqing, an old port worker, greeted me warmly. We sat down to talk about the draft constitution, and he said that the director had already explained it to them. He was really happy when he heard the news. He felt that the hard days were over, and the years were getting better and better. He told me about his life experience and the changes in the lives of workers from the past to the present. He told me that most of the people living here are port workers. From their youth, for twenty, thirty, or even fifty years, they lived a life of hardship in the port. In that tragic life, countless of their companions had already died. As he spoke, he excitedly stood up and led me out of the room, pointing to a row of dilapidated red houses on the opposite earth slope and said:

"Before liberation, port workers lived in those 'red houses' called 'Chinese Labor Shelters.' The workers toiled all day as coolies on the docks, carrying sacks weighing hundreds of pounds. They didn't even have time to catch their breath, and if they stopped for a moment, they would be beaten and scolded. The workers ate hard corn buns and drank the water from the steamers. In the dead of winter, many workers couldn't even afford worn-out clothes, but only wore tattered burlap sacks and worked barefoot. At night, they slept in the dark 'red houses' without bedding, using burlap sacks or straw mats to cover themselves and bricks as pillows. Workers from the south, because of acclimatization, and because they were both frozen and starved, died tragically by the hundreds and thousands; some were dragged out even before they stopped breathing." Then, he led me back to his room and continued:

"You probably don't know! This place where we live now used to be a living hell! It was nominally a 'Chinese Labor Hospital,' but in reality, it was a 'Hall of Yama.' Sick workers who went inside would turn five parts sick into eight parts, and before they died, they would be dragged out of the window. No one knows how many workers died inside every day." Recalling the past suffering, Zhang Shaoqing almost shed tears. "Comrade, I never dreamed that I would have today! Now the draft constitution specifically stipulates that the rights of our working people must be guaranteed, how can I not be moved!" A light of happiness shone on his wrinkled face.

When I came out of Zhang Shaoqing's room, crossed the corridor, and walked to another row of dormitories, the radio in the recreation room was broadcasting Ping opera, and several elderly workers were sitting around listening. Near the window, two elderly workers were intently playing chess; beside the wall, two other elderly workers were carefully looking through a comic book.

In another large dormitory, there were more than a dozen brand-new steel spring beds, with clean white quilts and white sheets, and several small wooden cabinets in front of the beds. I saw several elderly workers surrounding a bed, affectionately coaxing a little girl who was less than one year old. The child's eyes were wide open, smiling and reaching out to be held by the grandpas. A caregiver told me that it was the child of a laundry worker in the home.

In the corridor leading to the canteen, I heard the laughter of several elderly workers from afar. When I looked, it turned out that they were standing on scales, weighing themselves. A chubby old worker said to another old worker, "Look, I only weighed 115 pounds when I came, but now I weigh 160 pounds!" Another old worker wasn't willing to be outdone, and also stepped onto the scale, causing a nurse beside him to laugh.

At lunchtime, I saw a worker who had lost both arms and a worker who had lost both eyes eating happily. The worker who had lost both eyes spoke to me in a Beijing accent, and told me about his situation when he wandered here from Beijing more than ten years ago. His name is Wu Zhenfang, and he grew up in Beijing. Because his family was too poor, he started pulling a rickshaw at the age of sixteen, and pulled it for seventeen years. In the year that the Japanese invaders occupied Beijing, he escaped. He first wandered to Yantai, and then ran to Dalian, where he worked as a coolie in the Dalian port and suffered all kinds of torture. After Dalian was liberated, he unfortunately damaged his eyes while building roads in the port. He said with emotion, "Comrade, if it had been earlier, no one would have cared about me. Today, I am receiving such good care from the country. Although I can't see, my heart is bright!" While we were talking, another chubby old worker walked in with a smile. He seemed so cheerful and started talking to me as soon as he sat down. His name is Liu Hongbin, an old port worker with forty years of service, and is sixty-eight years old this year. He said that he had crawled out of death, and when he thought about the past and looked at the present, he felt that the lives of workers today are really too happy. Recently, he heard others explain the draft constitution and learned that the draft constitution stipulates that the state should provide material assistance to elderly workers. He said that he must do his best to help run the retirement home well.

Under the wisteria trellis in the small garden, I saw the old salt worker Li Yongkuan. When asked about his life after coming to the retirement home, he said excitedly that he had worked hard on the salt flats for more than 30 years. Before liberation, no one cared about him, and he was called a "salt donkey." He never thought that he would be able to enter the workers' retirement home in his old age and live a good life.

In the evening, a cool sea breeze blew. Some of the elderly gathered by the pond in the small garden, and some gathered in front of the small earth slope at the entrance of the home, listening to their companions telling stories. Eighty-two-year-old worker Qi Wanyou lay on a chair, resting his mind and listening. The young female caregiver Sun Yufang also sat on the stone steps at the entrance of the home, listening intently to the old workers telling stories, while mending clothes for the disabled old worker who had lost both arms.

    幸福的晚年
    本报记者　柏生
    旅大工人养老院，座落在大连寺儿沟南山脚下。这里，靠山面水，风景优美。院里有小花园，还有食堂、娱乐室、医务室、洗澡溏、理发室、礼堂……。
    清晨，当朝阳初升时，老工人们三三两两的在院内小花园里散步，呼吸新鲜空气。迎着海风，几个老工人从住处的楼窗旁出神地远眺；在院门口的小土坡前，几个老工人安祥地睡在躺椅上。
    当我走进一间整洁的宿舍里时，老海港工人张少卿亲切地打着招呼。我们坐下来谈宪法草案，他说，院长已经讲给他们听了。他听到这个消息时，可真是高兴。他感到：苦日子过去了，年月一天比一天更好过了。他感慨地对我谈起了自己的身世，又谈起了今昔工人生活的变化。他告诉我，住在这里的大部分是海港工人。他们从年青时代起，二十年、三十年、甚至五十年，在海港上过着苦难的日子。在悲惨的生活中，他们的伙伴们已经不知死去了多少。说着，他激动地站起来领我走出房门，指着对面土坡上一排排已经陈旧了的破红房子说：
  “解放前，海港工人就是住在那些被称为‘红房子’的‘华工收容所’里。工人们整天在码头上当苦力，一扛就是几百斤重的麻袋包，连喘口气的时间都没有，稍一停下来，就要挨打骂。工人吃的是生硬的窝窝头，喝的是蒸锅水。在深冬腊月，许多工人连破衣服都穿不上，只是披着破麻袋片，赤着脚干活；夜晚睡在阴暗的‘红房子’里，没有铺盖，就用麻袋或草帘子盖上，枕在砖头上。从南方来的工人，因水土不服，又冻又饿，就成千成百的凄惨地死去了；有的还没咽气，就被抬了出去。”接着，他又重新领我回到他的房间里，继续着说：
  “你大概还不知道呢！我们现在住的这个地方，过去也是个活地狱啊！它名义上是‘华工医院’，实际上是个‘阎王殿’，有病的工人进到里面，五分病倒变成了八分，还没断气就被人从窗户里拖了出去。每天死在里面的工人不知有多少。”张少卿回忆到过去的苦难，几乎要掉下眼泪来。“同志，那时我作梦也想不到有今天啊！现在宪法草案里还特别规定要保障我们劳动人民的权利，这使我怎能不感动呢！”他那发皱的面孔上，闪耀着一种幸福的光芒。
    我从张少卿的房间里出来，穿过走廊，走到另
  一排宿舍去的时候，娱乐室里的收音机正播送着评戏，几个老工人围坐在那里收听。靠近窗户处，两个老工人正聚精会神地下着象棋；墙边，另外两个老工人正在仔细地翻看着一本连环图画。
    在另一间宽大的宿舍里，放着十几张崭新的钢丝床，床上有整洁的白被子和白被单，床前还有几个小木柜。我看到几个老工人正围着一张床，亲热地哄着一个不满一岁的小女孩玩。孩子的眼睛张得大大的，笑着伸出手来要爷爷们抱她。一位护理人员告诉我，那是院里洗衣女工的孩子。
    在到食堂去的过道里，远远地我就听到几个老年工人的说笑声。一看，原来他们正站在磅秤上量体重。一个胖胖的老工人对另一个老工人说：“瞧，我来时才一百一十五斤，这会儿已有一百六十斤了！”另一个老工人也不示弱，一脚也站了上去，引得旁边的一位护理员哈哈大笑起来。
    吃午饭的时候，我看到一位失去双臂的工人和一位失去双目的工人在愉快地吃饭。那个失去双目的工人，用一口北京话，和我谈起了他十余年前从北京流浪到这里来的情况。他叫吴振芳，生长在北京，因为家里生活太困苦，十六岁上就开始拉车，一直拉了十七年；日寇侵占北京的那年，他才逃了出来。他最初流浪到烟台，以后又跑到大连来，在大连海港上做苦工，受尽了折磨。大连解放后，他在修筑海港的道路中不幸损坏了眼睛。他感动地说：“同志，要是在早先，我早就没人管了。今天，我受到国家这样好的照顾。我虽然眼睛看不见，可是我的心是豁亮的！”我们正在谈话时，另外一个胖胖的老工人笑着走了进来。他显得那么爽朗，一坐下就和我谈起来。他叫刘洪滨，是一个有着四十年工龄的海港老工人，今年六十八岁。他说自己是从死里滚出来的人，想想从前，再看看现在，感到如今工人的生活真是太幸福了。最近，他听别人讲解了宪法草案，知道宪法草案中规定国家对老年工人要给以物质的帮助。他表示一定要尽自己的力量，帮助办好养老院。
    在小花园的藤萝花架下，我看到了老盐工李永宽。问起他来养老院以后的生活时，他很兴奋地对我说，他在盐滩上已经苦干了三十多年。解放以前，从没有人关心过他，被人称作“盐驴子”。没有想到晚年还能进工人养老院，过好日子。
    傍晚，凉爽的海风吹拂着。老人们有的聚在小花园的水池边，有的聚在院门口的小土坡前，听着伙伴们讲故事。八十二岁的老工人戚万有，躺在椅上，一面养神，一面听着。年轻的女护理员孙玉芳也坐在院门口的石阶上，一面出神地听着老工人讲故事，一面给那位失去双臂的残废老工人缀补衣裳。（附图片）
