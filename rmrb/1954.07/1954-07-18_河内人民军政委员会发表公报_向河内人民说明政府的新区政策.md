Xinhua News Agency, July 17th: Vietnam News Agency reported on July 17th: The Hanoi People's Military and Administrative Committee issued a communiqué on July 15th to the people of this city occupied by French troops, regarding the policies of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in newly liberated areas, as follows:

The enemy suffered a disastrous defeat at Dien Bien Phu and has now been forced to withdraw from the four provinces south of the Red River Delta. They are now in Hanoi, doing their best to distort the policies of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, attempting to confuse the people and boost the morale of the puppet army and puppet government personnel.

The Hanoi People's Military and Administrative Committee deems it necessary to explain here the policies of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam regarding the newly liberated areas. These policies can be summarized as follows:

I. The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam guarantees the safety and livelihood of people of all social strata, protects those who earn a living in a legitimate manner, and encourages and helps the bourgeoisie develop industry and commerce.

II. The lives and property of foreigners and French citizens who do not take any hostile actions against the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam will be protected.

III. Puppet army officers and soldiers and puppet government personnel who abandon their enemy positions and return to the embrace of the motherland will enjoy the treatment of the government's lenient policies and the freedom and rights of Vietnamese citizens. Those who perform meritorious service will be rewarded.

        Issued on July 15, 1954, in Hanoi

    河内人民军政委员会发表公报
    向河内人民说明政府的新区政策
    【新华社十七日讯】据越南通讯社十七日讯：河内人民军政委员会七月十五日向这个法军占领的城市中的人民发表了一份关于越南民主共和国政府的新解放区政策的公报如下：
    敌人在奠边府遭到惨败，现已被迫撤出红河三角洲南部的四个省份。他们现在正在河内尽力歪曲越南民主共和国政府的政策，企图迷惑人心和振作伪军和伪政府人员的士气。
    河内人民军政委员会认为有必要在这里说明越南民主共和国政府关于新解放区的政策。这种政策可以简述如下：
    一、越南民主共和国政府保障各阶层人民的安全和生活，保护那些以正当方式谋生的人，鼓励并帮助资产阶级发展工商业；
    二、对于那些对越南民主共和国政府不采取任何敌对行动的外侨和法侨，他们的生命和财产将得到保护；
    三、伪军官兵和伪政府人员，凡放弃敌人职位而回到祖国怀抱来的，将享受政府的宽大政策的待遇和越南公民的自由和权利。立功者受奖。
                一九五四年七月十五日于河内
