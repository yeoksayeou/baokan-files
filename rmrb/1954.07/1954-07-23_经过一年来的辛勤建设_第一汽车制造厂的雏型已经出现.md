    After a Year of Hard Work
    The Prototype of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant Has Emerged
    Construction of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant began a year ago. After a year of construction, the prototype of this magnificent modern automobile factory has emerged. On both sides of the central avenue in the factory area, the main factory buildings, with the general assembly workshop as the center, have been erected one after another with good quality. The employee residential area surrounding the northeast of the factory area is also gradually forming a new urban area.

    When the white jade foundation stone inscribed with Chairman Mao's inscription "Foundation Commemoration of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant" was erected in the center of the factory last July 15, this was still a wasteland, but now it has changed its appearance. The woodworking shop, one of the first factory buildings to be built last year, has been completed ahead of schedule. The auxiliary workshop, chassis workshop, non-ferrous metal casting workshop, forging workshop and other factory buildings built at the same time as the woodworking shop have now been roofed, walled, and interior and exterior decoration work has begun. Following the early completion of the woodworking shop, the first batch of factory buildings, centered on the general assembly workshop, will also be completed successively in the third quarter of this year. The auxiliary workshop, which serves the current construction and automobile manufacturing, has now entered the final stage of intensive construction. Inside the tall factory buildings, groups of bulldozers and road rollers are flattening the ground under the illumination of floodlights. Employees of the mechanical and electrical installation units have arrived at the site, and bridge cranes are being installed on the crane beams, and the installation of various precision machines will begin in early August. A batch of auxiliary workshops that have been producing in temporary factory buildings since January this year will be moved to this factory building for formal production this year. At the same time, water, electricity, gas pipelines and bridge roads leading to the factory area will also be completed successively. The first batch of employee dormitories, organized by block, has already had more than forty buildings moved into by new owners, and a large number of dormitories will be completed successively after August. A prosperous and beautiful new urban area is taking shape in the northeast end of the factory area.

    According to the national construction plan indicators, dozens of factory building and dormitory building projects of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant have been fully started this year, and mechanical and electrical installation projects are also being actively carried out. In order to create conditions for the mechanical and electrical installation project, all employees are working day and night to speed up the construction of various construction projects. The thermal power plant of this factory, at the end of construction this winter, had just laid the foundations for the three main factory buildings. In the past two months, more than twenty sub-projects with different structures, such as coal transportation, water supply, lubrication, and power distribution systems, have made great progress. In order to ensure that this thermal power plant brings light and heat to the entire factory before the arrival of this winter, the construction workers have worked selflessly. They completed the foundation of the boiler room and the installation and hoisting of the 30-meter-high roof of the factory building before "July 1st". In early July, the light railway has been connected to the interior of the factory building, and the electrical installation unit is transporting the assembled boiler parts to the site and has started the installation of the thermal power plant ahead of schedule.

    While the construction project is under intensive construction, the production preparation work of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant is also being carried out intensively under the guidance of Soviet experts. All employees of the factory are carrying out technical preparation and technical supply work in a planned manner in accordance with the "Installation Preparation Work Schedule" and "Automobile Parts Production Preparation Work Schedule" planned by Soviet experts. Auxiliary tools necessary for manufacturing automobiles and blanks required for assembling automobiles have been ordered and trial-produced in temporary factory buildings. A batch of production tools and non-standard equipment have been manufactured in the temporary tool workshop, machine repair workshop, heat treatment workshop, and installation workshop that have been started successively since the first quarter of this year.

    经过一年来的辛勤建设
    第一汽车制造厂的雏型已经出现
    第一汽车制造厂开工建设已经一年了。经过一年的建设，这座雄伟的现代化汽车厂的雏型已经出现。在厂区的中央大道两旁，以总装配车间为中心的主要厂房，已在质量良好的基础上相继树立起来。环绕厂区东北的职工住宅区也逐渐形成新的市区。
    当去年七月十五日毛主席题词的“第一汽车制造厂奠基纪念”的白玉基石竖在厂中央时，这儿还是一片荒地，现在已经改变了面貌。去年动工最早的一个厂房——木工场已经提前完工。和木工场同时兴建的辅助工场、底盘工场、有色金属铸件工场、锻工场等厂房，目前已经铺好屋面板，砌上围墙，开始进行室内外装修工作。紧接着木工场提前完工之后，以总装配车间为中心的第一批厂房，也将在今年第三季度内相继落成。为当前建设和制造汽车服务的辅助工场，现已进入收尾工程紧张施工阶段。在高大的厂房内，成群的推土机、压路机在投光灯的照耀之下压平地面。机电安装单位的职工已来到现场，行车梁上正在安装桥式天车，八月初就将开始安装各式精密机器。从今年一月起，已在临时厂房生产的一批辅助车间，今年内就要搬到这座厂房来进行正式生产。同时通往厂区的水、电、煤气管道和桥梁道路，也将相继完工。按照街区为单位组成的第一批职工宿舍，已有四十多幢大楼搬进了新的主人，八月以后又将有大批宿舍相继落成。一座繁华美丽的新市区正在厂区东北端形成起来。
    按照国家建设计划指标，第一汽车制造厂今年厂房建筑、宿舍建筑已有几十项工程全面动工，机电安装工程也正在积极进行。全体职工为了给机电安装工程创造条件，各项建筑工程正日夜不停地加紧施工。这个工厂的热电站，在今年冬季施工结束时，刚打好三座主厂房的基础，两个多月来，运煤、给水、润滑、配电系统二十多项结构不同的分项工程，已经有了很大进展。为了保证这座热电站在今年冬季到来以前给全厂带来光和热，建厂职工进行了忘我的劳动。他们在“七一”前夕提前打好锅炉房的基础，完成了三十多公尺高的厂房屋面装吊工程。七月上旬轻便铁道已通到厂房内部，电气安装单位正把镶拼好的锅炉零件运进现场，提前开始了热电站的安装工程。
    和建设工程紧张施工同时，第一汽车制造厂的生产准备工作，也在苏联专家指导下紧张进行。全厂职工正按照苏联专家规划的“安装准备工作进度表”和“汽车零件生产准备工作进度表”有计划地进行技术准备和技术供应等工作。为制造汽车所必需的辅助工具和装配汽车所需要的毛坯，已经提出订货和在临时厂房内进行试制。从今年第一季度起相继开工的临时工具车间、机修车间、热处理车间、安装车间已经制造出一批生产工具和非标准设备。　　　　（新华社）
