Farmers of all nationalities in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region welcome new farm implements. In recent years, the Autonomous Region People's Government has issued more than 25 billion yuan in new farm implement loans, and according to the principle of "focusing on trial use and steadily promoting," it has promoted more than 75,490 pieces of sowing machines, harvesting machines, seed selectors, weeding machines, and various new-style plows. Sixteen new farm implement stations have been established as key points throughout the region.

The new farm implements that have been promoted are universally welcomed by farmers of all nationalities and have played a significant role. After the new-style walking plow was promoted in the western region, farmers praised it for plowing deeply, plowing smoothly, breaking the soil thoroughly, weeding cleanly, pulling lightly, and being highly efficient. With the same manpower and livestock, the new-style walking plow can plow an average of 1.5 to 2 mu more land per day than the old plow. Moreover, because deep plowing can store water and conserve moisture, crop yields average 10% to 20% higher than those plowed with the old plow. Shovel cultivators and weeding hoes have become urgently needed farm implements for farmers in Hulunbuir League, Jirem League, Zhaowuda League, and Chahar League. For example, last year, there was a lot of rain, and the seedlings grew uniformly. The use of shovel cultivators and weeding hoes not only saved labor but also ensured crop yields. After the harvester was tested in the wheat-producing areas of Inner Mongolia, it was also welcomed by the masses. The tense and arduous manual wheat harvesting work has been gradually replaced by harvesters.

In order to help farmers of all nationalities have sufficient farm implements to use, the Autonomous Region People's Government has also issued more than 23.97 billion yuan in loans for old-style farm implements while promoting new-style farm implements. According to incomplete statistics from 23 agricultural banners and counties in the eastern region, farmers have added more than 8,800 old plows and more than 281,500 pieces of farm implements such as harrows, hoes, and shovels. At present, the difficulty of lacking production tools has been basically resolved in the vast rural areas of Inner Mongolia. (Xinhua News Agency)

The Wuliying Agricultural Experiment Station in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region held a farmers' symposium this spring in conjunction with spring plowing and production to introduce the farm's cultivation techniques, listen to the opinions of the masses, and promote the surrounding farmers' reform of production techniques, which was commended by the Rural Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. Before spring plowing and sowing, the agricultural experiment station conducted a thorough survey and research on the production situation of nearby farmers. Then, it invited representatives of mutual aid and cooperative organizations and individual farmers of Mongolian and Han nationalities from eight townships in Tumote Banner and the suburbs of Hohhot to hold a symposium focusing on spring plowing and production. After the representatives studied the experiment station's guiding principles and tasks, they carefully discussed the three main issues of drought prevention and moisture conservation, sparse sowing and close planting of wheat, and seed treatment, and exchanged experiences with the experiment station's technical cadres. When discussing varieties, farmer Li Wanjin said: "Buckwheat is triangular and soybeans are fat, ten miles of villages are different" (meaning that different varieties should be sown due to different soil and climate), and he hoped that the experiment station could cultivate excellent seeds suitable for local cultivation. When discussing drought prevention and moisture conservation, farmer representatives introduced their own experiences based on local conditions. Some representatives also put forward some sincere hopes and opinions to the experiment station.

After the symposium, due to the representatives' active publicity when they returned, villages generally carried out land preparation ten to fifteen days in advance, and wheat seeds were generally screened, winnowed, treated with chemicals, and sun-dried. Many farmers' interest in planting wheat has greatly increased. For example, Qiaojiaying Village planted 700 mu of wheat last year, and 1,496 mu this year. Farmer Cui Liuwu originally did not plan to plant wheat this spring, but after learning the technology of moisture conservation and close planting, he also planted wheat, and now the wheat seedlings are growing vigorously. Farmer representative Li Laifen (female) realized after the symposium that it is necessary to organize in order to better improve technology and increase production, and she and her husband joined the mutual aid group the day after returning home.

During the summer hoeing period, in order to help farmers with thinning seedlings, protecting seedlings, and preventing and controlling pests, the experiment station sent a working group to tour the villages, using farmers' labor gaps to hold symposiums and introduce thinning and pest control techniques to farmers, which was welcomed by Mongolian and Han farmers.

    内蒙古自治区各族农民欢迎新式农具
    五里营农事试验场推动农民改革生产技术
    内蒙古自治区各族农民欢迎新式农具。几年来，自治区人民政府发放了二百五十多亿元的新式农具贷款，根据“重点试用、稳步推广”的方针，推广了播种机、收割机、选种机、除草机及各种新式犁七万五千四百九十多件，全区重点建立了新式农具站十六处。
    推广的新式农具普遍受到各族农民的欢迎，并发挥了很大的作用。西部地区推广新式步犁后，农民都称赞它耕得深、耕得通、破土碎、除草净、拉着轻、效率高。如果用同样的人工和牲畜，新式步犁比旧犁平均每天多耕一亩半到二亩地。并且因为深耕能蓄水保墒，作物产量平均比旧犁耕的地增产一成到二成。铲趟机、耘锄在呼伦贝尔盟、哲里木盟、昭乌达盟、察哈尔盟已成为农民迫切需要的农具。如去年雨多，草苗齐长，农民使用铲趟机和耘锄不仅节省了人工，并且保证了作物的产量。收割机在内蒙古产麦地区试用后，也受到了群众的欢迎。紧张、繁重的人工麦收工作，已逐步由收割机来代替了。
    为了帮助各族农民有充足的农具使用，自治区人民政府在推广新式农具的同时，还发放了二百三十九亿七千多万元的旧式农具贷款。根据东部地区二十三个农业旗、县的不完全统计，农民已添置了八千八百多张旧犁及耧、锄、锹等农具二十八万一千五百多件。现在，在内蒙古广大农村，缺乏生产工具的困难已基本上解决。（新华社）

    内蒙古自治区五里营农事试验场，今年春天结合春耕生产召开农民座谈会，介绍农场耕作技术，听取群众意见，推动周围农民改革生产技术，受到了中共中央农村工作部的通报表扬。这个农事试验场在春耕播种前，对附近农民的生产情况作了周密的调查研究，接着就邀请土默特旗、呼和浩特市郊区八个乡的蒙、汉族农民互助合作组织和个体农民的代表，举行以春耕生产为中心的座谈会。代表们研究试验场的方针任务后，仔细讨论了生产中的防旱保墒、小麦疏播密植和种子处理三个主要问题，并和试验场技术干部交流了经验。在讨论品种时，农民李万金说：“荞麦三棱大豆胖，十里乡村不一样”（意思是因土壤气候不同，应播种不同的品种），他希望试验场能培育出适合当地栽培的优良种子。在讨论防旱保墒时，农民代表根据当地情况介绍了自己的经验。有些代表并对试验场提出了一些恳切的希望和意见。
    开过座谈会以后，由于代表们回去积极宣传，各村庄一般都提前十天到十五天进行整地，小麦籽种普遍经过了筛选、风选、药剂拌种和阳光晒种。不少农民对种植小麦的兴趣大大提高，如去年乔家营村种小麦七百亩，今年种了一千四百九十六亩。农民崔六五的田地，今春原来不打算种小麦，但他学会了保墒密植的技术后，也种植了小麦，现在麦苗茁壮良好。农民代表李来芬（女）经过座谈会后，认识到要组织起来才能更好地提高技术，增加生产，回家后第二天就和丈夫参加了互助组。
    在夏锄期间，试验场为了帮助农民间苗、保苗和防治虫害，又派出一个工作组到各乡巡回活动，利用农民劳动间隙开座谈会，向农民介绍间苗和防虫技术，受到了蒙汉族农民的欢迎。（新华社）
