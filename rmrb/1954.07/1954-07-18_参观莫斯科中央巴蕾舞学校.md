The Moscow Central Ballet School, which trains ballet dancers for the Soviet Bolshoi Theatre, was established in 1773 and has a long history of 180 years. It was originally an institution attached to an educational organization that specifically housed orphans to learn dance, and later gradually became an independent ballet school. In June, we had a rare opportunity to visit this school.

The Soviet people rightly call the Bolshoi Theatre the pride of Soviet art. Every visitor to Moscow makes sure to see a ballet performance at the Bolshoi Theatre. Before the October Revolution, there were two ballet schools in Russia at the time. One was the school we visited, and the other was in Leningrad. Now, there are fifteen ballet schools throughout the Soviet Union, distributed throughout the country. However, the two oldest schools in Moscow and Leningrad still hold leading positions. In addition to training ballet dancers for the Bolshoi Theatre, the Moscow Central Ballet School also trains actors for the opera houses of various union republics.

We entered the school's old building on a quiet street near the Bolshoi Theatre. We were first received in the principal's office. Principal Pocharnikova, a former student of the school, warmly and sincerely introduced us to the students' lives and studies.

Ballet is a beautiful but quite arduous labor. Ballet dancers must undergo persistent and long-term efforts to train, and must receive multifaceted help and training to learn this art. The Central Ballet School enrolls students once a year. The enrollment process is quite complex and requires the participation of education experts and specialized doctors. Applicants must be proven to have the qualified health conditions and artistic abilities to master the future art of ballet before they are admitted. Each year, only thirty students, half male and half female, are admitted from more than five hundred nine-year-old applicants. These admitted students have excellent physical characteristics: proportionate body structure, supple physique, and special jumping and lifting abilities. Their performance talent, especially their ability to perceive complex music, is also at a certain level.

Students study at the school for nine years. From the first to third grades, the curriculum is mostly professional training. General courses are gradually added from the fourth grade onwards. Before the seventh grade, if students are found to be unable to continue their studies in terms of physical fitness or artistic ability, they can transfer to other schools. However, this type of elimination will no longer occur in the seventh grade, because at this time, the students' physical and intellectual development has basically taken shape. Therefore, students are always able to graduate after the seventh grade.

After entering the ballet school, students undergo nine years of rigorous training and intense study life. Except for a one-hour break at noon, students' study and practice time is from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. every day. Sometimes, they have to practice rehearsals in the evening. The school has its own specialized medical office. All the food in the school cafeteria must be equipped according to the doctor's advice to ensure the normal development of the students' physical fitness and health during the learning process, and to meet the requirements of learning. In addition to its own full-time teachers, many famous actors from the Bolshoi Theatre also come to the school to teach. They pass on their many years of stage art experience to the next generation of young ballet dancers. Many leading ballet dancers at the Bolshoi Theatre now, such as Lepeshinskaya, Kondratov, Struichkova, and Plisetskaya, are all graduates of the Central Ballet School. Their deep relationship with their alma mater goes without saying.

By the seventh grade, students have generally completed the basic training of ballet and can perform and practice independently. The school attaches great importance to students' internship work. Students often participate in performances at the Bolshoi Theatre. The school often organizes independent performance evenings at the Bolshoi Theatre's branch, and maintains its own independent programs in the branch's program list. This year, the school went to Leningrad for a tour performance, which was the first time in the school's history; it also participated in the commemorative performance in Kiev celebrating the 300th anniversary of the reunification of Ukraine and Russia. School students also participated in the performance at the Third World Youth and Student Peace Festival in Berlin and won an award.

Most of the school's students enjoy free treatment, and many students also receive scholarships. In the summer, students can get free travel permits to travel outside. The school has its own Young Pioneer summer camp, and younger students rest in the summer camp during the summer.

Since 1945, the school has begun to train ballet actors for people's democratic countries. Currently, there are four North Korean students, eight Albanian students, and one Bulgarian student studying at the school.

The school also individually enrolls students who, although overage, do have ballet talent. For example, a student named Baukin, who is currently studying at the school, is already twenty years old and graduated from the Dnepropetrovsk Mining Institute last year. For these students, the school formulates a separate teaching plan according to their situation, reducing some subjects. The North Korean female student An Seong-hee, who came to the school in 1952, is already eighteen years old this year. She also studies alone. She is already familiar with the basic movements of dance, so she only studies the more compact courses that are necessary for ballet dancers.

After Pocharnikova finished introducing us, she personally guided us to see the students studying. We first visited the training of seven male students in the fifth grade. Under the guidance of the teacher, with the accompaniment of the piano, they performed a total of five songs, almost performing the basic dance movements of ballet. However, they must hold on to the railings nailed to the wall when performing, and cannot leave the fixed place. Then, we went to another classroom to visit the practice of six female students in the eighth grade. They are no longer practicing the basic movements of ballet, but practicing a complete short dance, or performing a section taken from the entire ballet. In this way, students gradually acquire the skills of ballet from daily and constant labor practice. Without such daily and constant practice, ballet dancers will quickly lose the ability to master this art. In the same classroom, we also watched four performances. Seventh-grade female student Cherkaskaya performed a section from Tchaikovsky's "The Nutcracker" ballet. This ballet is a program that the school often performs at the Bolshoi Theatre's branch. The female principal told us that sixteen-year-old Cherkaskaya is the best student in the school, with outstanding ballet talent and is very likely to become the future Ulanova. We watched her beautiful and moving dance, very agile movements, and delicate expressions, and believed that the female principal's praise and hope for her were well-founded. Her dance partner was an eighth-grade student, also one of the excellent students.

In addition, we also watched a collective folk dance, watched An Seong-hee perform a Korean national dance, and watched ninth-grade female student Sokolova perform a section from the ballet "Mirandolina." When we said goodbye to the principal and students, we all hoped that this school with such a long history would train more and more outstanding ballet dancers, and wished this fascinating art of ballet to achieve better development.

    参观莫斯科中央巴蕾舞学校
    新华社驻莫斯科记者  李楠
    为苏联大剧院培养巴蕾舞演员的莫斯科中央巴蕾舞学校开办于一七七三年，算起来已有一百八十年的悠久历史了。它最初是附属于一个教育机关专门收容孤儿学习舞蹈的机构，后来逐渐成为独立的巴蕾舞学校。六月间，我们获得一个难得的机会，参观了这个学校。
    苏联人民合理地称呼大剧院为苏联艺术的骄傲。大剧院的巴蕾舞剧，凡是到莫斯科的人没有不去看看的。在十月革命前，当时的俄国共有两所巴蕾舞学校，一所就是我们前去参观的学校，另一所设在列宁格勒。现在，全苏联共有十五所巴蕾舞学校，分布在全国各地。不过莫斯科和列宁格勒的这两所历史最悠久的学校仍然居于领导地位。莫斯科中央巴蕾舞学校除为大剧院培养巴蕾舞演员外，也给各加盟共和国的歌舞剧院培养演员。
    在大剧院附近一条幽静的街道上，我们进入了这所学校的古老的楼房。我们首先被接待到校长室里。校长波恰尔尼科娃从前也是这个学校毕业的学生，她热情恳挚地向我们介绍了学校学生的生活和学习情况。
    巴蕾舞是一种优美的但却相当艰巨的劳动。巴蕾舞演员必须经过坚忍不拔的长期努力锻炼，并必须得到多方面的帮助和培养才能学会这种艺术技巧。中央巴蕾舞学校每年招生一次。招生的过程是相当复杂的，需要教育专家和专门的医生参加。投考的学生必须在被证明有合格的健康条件和艺术能力足以掌握将来的巴蕾舞艺术时，才被录取。每年从五百多名投考的九岁儿童中，只录取三十名，其中男女各半。这些被录取的学生都具有体格方面的优良特点：身体组织的各部分的比例相称，身躯柔和，具有特殊的跳跃能力和上举能力等等。他们的表演才能，特别是对复杂音乐的感受能力都够一定的水平。
    学生共在学校中学习九年。从一年级到三年级的课程绝大部分是专业训练。从四年级起才逐渐增加一般的课程。在七年级以前，学生如在体格方面，或在艺术能力方面发现不能继续学习下去时，可以转学到其他的学校去。但到了七年级，就不会再有这种淘汰现象发生了，因为这时，学生的体力和智慧才能的发育状况已基本形成。所以学生到了七年级以后，总是能够学习毕业的。
    学生进入巴蕾舞学校以后，要经过九年严格的训练和紧张的学习生活。除中午一小时休息外，每天由上午九时到下午五时是学生的学习和练习时间。有时，晚上还要练习排演。学校有自己专设的医务室。学校食堂的一切饮食都须根据医生的意见配备，以保证在学习过程中学生的体格和健康的正常发展，能够满足学习的要求。学校除了自己的专职教员外，大剧院的许多著名演员也到学校教课。他们将自己多年的舞台艺术经验传授给下一代的青年巴蕾舞演员。现在大剧院的许多居于领导地位的巴蕾舞演员，如列皮辛斯卡雅、康德拉托夫、斯特鲁奇科娃、普利塞茨卡雅等人都是由中央巴蕾舞学校毕业出来的。他们对自己母校关系的深切自不待言了。
    学生到了七年级大抵上就完成了巴蕾舞的基本训练，就能进行独立的表演和实习了。学校对于学生的实习工作非常重视。学生们常参加大剧院的演出。学校常常在大剧院分院组织独立演出的晚会，并在分院的节目单中保持自己的独立节目。今年，学校到列宁格勒去作了旅行演出，这在学校历史上还是第一次；还到基辅参加庆祝乌克兰与俄罗斯重新合并三百周年的纪念演出。学校学生还参加过在柏林举行的第三届世界青年与学生和平联欢节表演，并且得了奖。
    学校的学生大部分是享受免费待遇的，许多学生还获得奖学金。在夏季，学生可以获得免费的旅行证，出外旅行。学校有自己少先队夏令营，暑天年纪较小的学生就在夏令营中休息。
    从一九四五年起，学校开始为人民民主国家培养舞剧演员。目前，在学校中学习的有四个朝鲜学生、八个阿尔巴尼亚学生和一个保加利亚学生。
    学校也个别地招收虽然超龄但确实有巴蕾舞天才的学生。例如，现在正在学校学习的一个名叫巴乌金的学生，今年已经二十岁了，去年他在第聂伯罗彼得罗夫斯克矿山学院毕业。对于这类学生，学校根据他们的情况拟定单独的教学计划，缩减一些课目。一九五二年来学校学习的朝鲜女学生安圣姬今年已经十八岁了。她也是单独学习的，她对舞蹈的基本动作已经熟悉，因此她只学习比较紧凑但对于巴蕾舞演员来说是必要的课程。
    波恰尔尼科娃向我们介绍完毕后，亲自引导我们参观学生们学习的情形。我们首先参观五年级七个男生的训练。他们在教师的指导下，随着钢琴的伴奏，一共表演了五个歌曲，差不多把巴蕾舞的基本舞蹈动作都表演了。但是他们在表演时还必须扶着钉在壁上的栏杆，不能离开固定的地方。接着，我们又到另外一间教室参观八年级六名女生的练习。她们已不是练习巴蕾舞的基本动作，而是练习一个完整的短舞，或表演从整个舞剧中抽出来的一段。学生们就是这样一步一步地从每日不息的劳动练习中逐步获得巴蕾舞的技巧。没有这样逐日有恒的练习，巴蕾舞演员很快就会丧失掌握这种艺术的能力。在同一个教室里，我们还看了四个表演。七年级女学生契尔卡斯卡雅表演了柴可夫斯基的“胡桃夹”舞剧中的一段。这个舞剧是学校经常在大剧院分院演出的一个节目。女校长告诉我们：十六岁的契尔卡斯卡雅，是学校最优秀的学生，有卓越的巴蕾舞天才，很有希望成为未来的乌兰诺娃。我们看了她优美动人的舞姿，非常灵敏的动作和细致的表情，相信女校长对她的赞许和希望是有十分根据的。和她伴舞的是八年级的学生，也是成绩优秀的学生之一。
    另外，我们还看了一个集体的民间舞，看了安圣姬表演的朝鲜民族舞蹈和九年级女生索科洛娃表演的巴蕾舞“米兰多丽娜”中的一段。当我们辞别了校长和学生们时，我们都愿望这个有这么悠长历史的学校培养出更多更杰出的巴蕾舞演员，祝福这个使人迷恋的巴蕾舞艺术获得更好的发展。
