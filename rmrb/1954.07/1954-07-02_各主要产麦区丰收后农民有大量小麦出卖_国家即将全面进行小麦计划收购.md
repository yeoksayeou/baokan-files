Xinhua News Agency, 30th. China's major wheat-producing regions, including Hebei, Henan, Shaanxi, Shandong, Jiangsu, and Anhui provinces, have completed wheat harvesting. In July, the state will fully implement planned wheat purchases in these regions.

This year, major wheat-producing areas across the country have had bumper harvests, and farmers will have large quantities of wheat to sell. On the alluvial plains of the lower Yellow River, Shandong Province's 57 counties, with a total of 30 million mu of wheat, saw a 37% increase in total output compared to last year. Farmers will have 780 million jin of wheat to sell, 370 million jin more than the state purchased in these counties in 1953. Shaanxi Province has had consecutive years of good wheat harvests. This year, the province's total output from more than 23.58 million mu of wheat increased by 5.82% compared to last year, with an average yield per mu increasing by 3.16% compared to last year. The wheat in the Huai River basin has also had another bumper harvest this year. In the southern and eastern parts of Henan Province, and the northern parts of Anhui and Jiangsu provinces, the over 80 million mu of wheat fields are expected to yield nearly 10 billion jin of wheat. Currently, major wheat-producing areas have generally prepared for planned wheat purchases, based on the principle of adapting to local conditions. After conducting a thorough survey of wheat production, the Shaanxi Provincial People's Government formulated interim measures for planned summer grain purchases. The Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Shaanxi Provincial People's Government also issued instructions, requiring subordinate organizations at all levels to combine the promotion of the draft constitution with the planned wheat purchase, on the basis of helping the masses develop and consolidate mutual aid and cooperative organizations and improving agricultural production. During the purchases, strict adherence to the principle of "purchasing more if there is more surplus, purchasing less if there is less surplus, and not purchasing if there is no surplus" is required, and efforts should be made to do a good job of "better prices for better grain" and "grading and pricing." Currently, counties across Shaanxi Province have universally convened three-level cadre meetings to arrange for planned wheat purchases. The financial and economic leading departments of Henan Province and various special districts and counties have successively conducted key experiments on purchases in more than 500 typical townships and villages. The Provincial People's Government also held meetings to summarize the pilot experiences. Currently, many counties are holding or preparing to hold expanded cadre meetings to arrange for wheat requisition and purchases. In May, counties in the wheat-producing areas of Jiangsu Province universally convened meetings of purchasing personnel, organizing them to study purchasing operations and price policies. In addition to holding meetings to arrange for summer requisition and planned purchase work, the People's Governments of Hebei Province and the special districts also established special agencies to conduct specific leadership. Shandong Province has also made arrangements for personnel organization, warehouse preparation, and material supply for wheat purchases through meetings. The majority of the wheat that farmers in Anhui Province are preparing to sell has already been pre-purchased by the state, so the province decided to start wheat purchases by mobilizing farmers to fulfill their wheat pre-purchase contracts. In addition, the above-mentioned provinces have also made preparations for wheat warehousing. Grain departments in various parts of Shaanxi Province have whitewashed, cleaned, and lined all warehouses. State-owned commercial departments and cooperatives have also prepared a large number of materials, ready to supply farmers during the purchases. The People's Bank of China is also preparing to combine planned wheat purchases with the development of grain sales savings and the recovery of overdue agricultural loans.

Farmers in major wheat-producing areas have mostly prepared to sell surplus grain. Many agricultural production cooperatives have formulated plans to sell wheat, and some farmers have already begun selling. The more than 2,000 wheat purchasing points established by the grain departments and supply and marketing cooperatives in Anhui Province have had a maximum daily purchase volume of 25 million jin, and the daily purchase volume of grain departments and supply and marketing cooperatives in Jiangsu Province is also nearly 10 million jin.

    各主要产麦区丰收后农民有大量小麦出卖
    国家即将全面进行小麦计划收购
   【新华社三十日讯】我国主要产麦地区河北、河南、陕西、山东、江苏、安徽等省的小麦已经收割完毕，七月份国家将在这些地区全面进行小麦的计划收购工作。
    今年，全国各主要产麦区小麦获得丰收，农民将有大量的小麦出卖。在黄河下游冲积平原上，山东省五十七个县三千万亩小麦的总产量比去年增加百分之三十七，农民将有七亿八千万斤小麦出卖，比一九五三年国家在这些县收购的数量多三亿七千万斤。陕西省小麦连年丰收，今年全省二千三百五十八万多亩小麦的总产量又比去年增加百分之五点八二，平均每亩产量比去年增加百分之三点一六。淮河流域的小麦今年也又一次得到丰收。河南省南部和东部、安徽、江苏二省的北部八千多万亩麦田，预计可收小麦近百亿斤。现在各主要产麦区根据因地制宜的原则，大体作好了小麦计划收购的准备工作。陕西省人民政府在重点调查了小麦的产量情况以后，制订了夏季粮食计划收购暂行办法。中共陕西省委员会和陕西省人民政府并发出指示，要求所属各级组织在帮助群众发展和巩固互助合作组织、搞好农业生产的基础上，结合宪法草案的宣传开展小麦的计划收购。在收购中，要求严格按照
  “多余多购、少余少购、不余不购”的原则办事，并认真做好“优粮优价”、“分等论价”的工作。现在陕西省各县已普遍召开了三级干部会议，对小麦的计划收购作了布置。河南省和各专区、各县的财经领导部门先后在五百多个典型乡、村作了收购的重点试验，省人民政府并召开会议总结了试点经验，目前许多县正在或正准备召开扩大干部会议，布置小麦的征收和收购工作。江苏省小麦产区各县五月份就普遍召开了收购人员会议，组织他们学习了收购业务和价格政策。河北省除召开会议布置夏季征收和计划收购工作外，省人民政府和专区人民政府还专门设立机构进行具体领导。山东省也通过会议，对小麦收购的人员组织、仓库准备、物资供应等方面作了安排。安徽省农民准备出卖的小麦大部分已为国家所预购，因此这个省决定从发动农民履行小麦预购合同入手来收购小麦。另外，上述各省对小麦入库工作也大都作好准备。陕西省各地粮食部门对所有仓库作了粉刷、打扫和铺垫等工作。国营商业部门和合作社也预备了大批物资，准备在收购中供应农民。人民银行也准备结合小麦的计划收购开展售粮储蓄和收回到期的农贷。
    各主要小麦产地的农民大都作好了出卖余粮的准备。许多农业生产合作社订出了出卖小麦的计划，有些农民并已开始出卖。安徽省粮食部门和供销合作社在各地设立的两千多个小麦收购点每日收购量最多曾达二千五百万斤，江苏省粮食部门和供销合作社每天收购量也近一千万斤。
