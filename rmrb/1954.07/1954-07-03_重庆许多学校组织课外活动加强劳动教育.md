Many middle and primary schools in Chongqing have organized a variety of meaningful extracurricular activities this semester, such as visits, gatherings, tours, and greening the campus, to strengthen labor education. Taihua Lou Primary School and Lianglukou Primary School in Chongqing held gatherings entitled "All Labor is Glorious" and "Collective Labor is Wonderful" respectively, and visited dockworkers, nurses, and suburban agricultural producers' cooperatives. Students from Jinma Temple Primary School, Middle Fourth Road Primary School, and other schools also visited technical innovators, female bus drivers, postmen, construction workers, and mutual aid teams in the suburban countryside during holidays. Through these activities, young students gradually realized the glory and greatness of labor, cultivated the habit of loving labor, and developed respect for laborers. Wang Guohao, a student at Middle First Road Primary School, did not like carpentry and masonry in the past. In a Young Pioneer squad meeting, he accepted the task of making a five-pointed star. When he learned to plane wood from the carpenter, he thought of how the house he lived in and the furniture he used were all made by carpenters. Since then, he no longer looked down on carpentry. Huang Dexiu, a student at Lianglukou Primary School, heard the dockworkers tell stories about transporting supplies to factories in the hot weather and delivering night soil to farmers in the late night, which made her respect dockworkers even more. Many fourth-grade students at Chongqing Primary School wrote in a composition entitled "I Love Labor": I love labor because I want to be a person who creates happiness.

Many middle and primary school students also use extracurricular time to participate in some public welfare labor. They personally plant trees and flowers on campus and repair damaged walls in classrooms or dormitories. Students from Chongqing No. 2 Middle School also help nearby farmers gather firewood, carry water, collect pigweed, and catch pests. Many students take the initiative to help the families of revolutionary martyrs and the families of revolutionary soldiers with housework; they help the school manufacture and repair teaching aids and models. Through labor, students gradually understand the hardships of labor, cherish the fruits of labor, and experience the joy of labor. When students at Taihua Lou Primary School made a model of the "Three Major Projects of Anshan Iron and Steel" with mud, they succeeded only after six attempts. They thought that making a model was so difficult, how great was the hard work of the people who built Anshan Iron and Steel. Students from No. 2 Middle School and No. 20 Middle School cherish the farmers' crops very much, and they wrote many slogans "Do Not Tread on Crops" and posted them on the roadside. In the activities of greening the campus, planting trees, flowers, and vegetables, the students of No. 20 Middle School clarified the significance of division of labor in collective labor. Zhao Qiwen, a junior high school student at the school, decided to go home to participate in agricultural production after graduation. During the spring break, he went home to visit the mutual aid team, and the young friends of the mutual aid team shook his hand and said: We welcome you. (Xinhua News Agency)

    重庆许多学校组织课外活动加强劳动教育
    这学期重庆市许多中、小学校都组织了访问、联欢、参观、绿化校园等多种多样有意义的课外活动。重庆市太华楼小学、两路口小学曾在分别举行的“一切劳动都光荣”和“集体劳动多么好”集会活动中，访问了搬运工人、护士和郊区农业生产合作社；金马寺小学、中四路小学等学校的学生们还在假日里去访问了技术革新者、公共汽车女司机、邮递员、建筑工人和郊区农村的互助组。少年学生们在这些活动中逐步体会到劳动的光荣和伟大，养成了爱劳动的习惯和尊敬劳动者的情感。中一路小学学生王国浩过去不欢喜木工和泥工，在一次少年先锋队中队集会中，他接受了制一个五角星的工作，他向木工学习刨木时，联想到住的房子和用的家具等许多东西都是木工制造的，从此他再不轻视木工了。两路口小学学生黄德秀听了搬运工人讲述他们在大热天里把物资送往工厂，在深夜里把粪便运给农民的事迹，使她更加尊敬搬运工人了。重庆小学四年级的许多学生在一次以“我热爱劳动”为题的作文中写道：我爱劳动，因为我要做一个创造幸福的人。
    许多中、小学的学生们还利用课外活动时间参加一些公益劳动。他们在学校里亲手栽植树木和花草；修补教室或宿舍破损的墙壁。重庆市第二中学的学生还帮助附近农民拣柴，抬水，打猪草，捕捉害虫。许多学校的学生主动地帮助革命烈士家属、革命军人家属做家务事；帮助学校制造、修补教具和模型。经过劳动，学生们逐步知道劳动的艰苦，也珍惜劳动成果和体会到劳动的愉快了。太华楼小学学生用泥做“鞍钢三大工程”的模型时，做了六次才成功。他们想到做模型都这样不容易，建设鞍钢的人们的艰苦劳动是多伟大啊。第二中学和第二十中学的学生们对农民的庄稼非常爱护，他们写了许多“莫踏庄稼”的标语贴在路边。在绿化校园、栽植树木花草和蔬菜的活动中，第二十中学的学生们明确了集体劳动中分工的意义。该校初三下学生赵启文决定毕业后就回家参加农业生产。春假期间他回家去访问了互助组，互助组的青年朋友们紧握着他的手说：我们欢迎你。（新华社）
