Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: French, British, and Swiss newspapers continue to publish commentaries on Dulles' visit to Paris and the results of the separate meeting of the three foreign ministers.

    The French newspaper "L'Humanité" published an editorial stating that Dulles came to Paris not to accelerate the establishment of peace, but for the exact opposite purpose. Dulles' very uncommon approach is to intensify the implementation of the American aggression plan, which has been damaged by the initial achievements of the Geneva Conference. "L'Humanité" cited a New China News Agency report that Dulles hoped to "force the French and British foreign ministers to submit to the American policy of sabotaging the Geneva Conference."

    "L'Humanité" continued: "From all indications, Dulles' attempt has encountered a reality that no one can erase, namely: the military situation in Indochina, the almost unanimous desire of our people to achieve peace, and the need to consider the enormous changes that have taken place in Asia in recent years. … Dulles himself finally had to take into account the enormous hopes that people place in the Geneva Conference, which partly explains why he decided to send his assistant Smith to the final stage of the Geneva Conference."

    "L'Humanité" finally emphasized that peace has not yet been won, and only continued action can achieve peace. Smith is not lacking in intrigue, and he will use this intrigue at the Geneva Conference, because the United States has apparently not given up making a final effort to sabotage the negotiations.

    "Libération's" Geneva correspondent wrote: "Although the communiqué mentions frank talks, everyone here understands that no agreement was reached. When the results of the talks are described as a clear understanding of each other's positions, it means that these positions are not consistent."

    The London "Daily Worker's" Paris correspondent wrote: Dulles' agreement to send Smith back to Geneva "seems to be only a clumsy attempt to cover up the huge cracks in the Western countries' 'unity' on the Indochina issue."

   The "Manchester Guardian" wrote: "What remains to be seen now is the extent to which the American delegation will agree to associate itself with any Indochina agreement that may be reached in Geneva." The "Manchester Guardian," referring to the phrase in the communiqué regarding the limits of the US attitude toward the Geneva Conference, emphasized: "This leaves the United States a way out of refusing to associate itself with the ceasefire terms—if it does not fully agree with these terms..."

    The "Daily Express" Geneva correspondent wrote that diplomats' interpretation of the Paris conference communiqué is: "As far as the United States is concerned, Mr. Dulles has publicly written off the Geneva Conference. But as a precaution, he has agreed to send his assistant Smith to Geneva." The reporter also said: The passage in the communiqué explaining the US government's attitude toward the Indochina issue "and the limits that this government hopes to observe because it does not bear primary responsibility for the Indochina war itself" is "considered a clear indication that the United States refuses to support the kind of solution to the Indochina issue that Mr. Eden and Mr. Mendès-France are currently negotiating."

    The Swiss "Voix Ouvrière" wrote: The communiqué "shows that France and the United States have not come much closer to each other than before on the issue of resolving the Indochina problem." The newspaper pointed out that the content of the communiqué "undoubtedly reserves the possibility for the United States not to participate in a peaceful solution."

    "Journal de Genève," in discussing the communiqué, said: "Apart from announcing Smith's return to Geneva, the communiqué shows a somewhat passive nature, because it emphasizes the three countries' 'respective positions,' announces that the United States has no direct interest in the Indochina war, and explains the 'limits' that the United States intends to determine for itself."

### 法、英、瑞士报纸评美英法外长单独会谈  指出杜勒斯碰到了无人能够抹杀的现实

    法、英、瑞士报纸评美英法外长单独会谈
    指出杜勒斯碰到了无人能够抹杀的现实
    据新华社讯：法国、英国和瑞士报纸继续就杜勒斯访问巴黎一事以及三国外长举行单独会谈的结果发表评论。
    法国“人道报”发表社论说，杜勒斯到巴黎来不是为了加速建立和平，而是为了完全相反的目的。杜勒斯的这种很不常见的做法是为了加紧推行美国的侵略计划，这个计划由于日内瓦会议取得的初步成就而遭到损害了。“人道报”引用了新华通讯社的消息说，杜勒斯希望“迫使法、英两国外长屈从美国破坏日内瓦会议的政策”。
    “人道报”继续说道：“从各种迹象看来，杜勒斯的企图碰到了无人能够抹杀的现实，即：印度支那的军事形势，我国人民的几乎一致的愿意实现和平的态度，考虑亚洲最近几年来发生的巨大变化的必要性。……杜勒斯本人最后不得不考虑到人们对日内瓦会议所寄予的巨大的希望，这就部分说明了他为什么决定派遣他的助手史密斯参加日内瓦会议最后阶段的会议。”
    “人道报”最后强调指出，和平还没有赢得，只有继续采取行动才能获得和平。史密斯并不缺少阴谋伎俩，他将在日内瓦会议上耍弄这种伎俩，因为美国显然并没有放弃作最后的努力来破坏谈判的企图。
      “解放报”驻日内瓦记者写道：“虽然公报中提到坦率的会谈，但这里的每一个人都明了，并没有达成协议。当会谈结果被描述为对各自立场的明确了解时，那便意味着：这些立场并不一致。”
    英国“工人日报”驻巴黎记者写道：杜勒斯同意派遣史密斯回日内瓦去，“看来只是为了掩饰西方国家在印度支那问题上的‘团结’方面的巨大裂痕而采取的一种笨拙做法。”
   “曼彻斯特卫报”写道：“现在所要等着瞧的是：美国代表团将同意使它自己和可能在日内瓦达成的任何印度支那协议发生何种程度的联系”。“曼彻斯特卫报”在提到公报里关于美国对日内瓦会议的态度的限度这句话时强调指出：“这就给美国为拒绝和停火条款发生联系——如果它不完全同意这些条款的话——留下了后路……”
      “每日快报”驻日内瓦记者写道，外交家们对于巴黎会议的公报的解释是：“就美国而论，杜勒斯先生已经公开地一笔勾销了日内瓦会议。但是为了保险起见，他已同意派遣他的助理史密斯到日内瓦去。”这个记者又说：公报中关于解释美国政府对于印度支那问题的态度“以及这个政府由于本身对印度支那战争不承担主要责任而希望遵守的限度”的那一段，“被认为是明白表示美国拒绝支持目前艾登先生和孟戴斯—弗朗斯先生正在磋商的那种解决印度支那问题的办法。”
    瑞士“工人之声报”写道：公报“说明，法国同美国对于解决印度支那问题的立场并没有比以前大大接近”。这个报纸指出，公报的内容“毫无疑问替美国保留了不参与和平解决办法的可能性”。
      “日内瓦日报”在谈到公报时说：“公报除宣布史密斯回日内瓦以外，多少表现出了一种消极的性质，因为它强调指出三国‘各自的立场’宣布美国对于印度支那战争没有直接的利害关系，并且解释了美国自己打算确定的‘限度’。”
