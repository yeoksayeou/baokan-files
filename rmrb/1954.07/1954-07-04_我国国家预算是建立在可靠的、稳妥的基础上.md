Our National Budget is Built on a Reliable and Solid Foundation
    Wang Jingzhi

    The 1954 national budget, formulated under the glorious illumination of the general task of the state's transition period, has been approved by the 31st meeting of the Central People's Government Committee. The 1954 national budget fully reflects the Party and government's policy of further developing the national economy, ensuring the priority growth of heavy industry, reflects the Party and government's concern for raising the material and cultural living standards of residents, and ensures the consolidation and strengthening of national defense forces.

    I

    The characteristic of the 1954 national budget is that revenue and expenditure are based on a reliable and solid foundation.

    One of the main signs that the national budget is built on a reliable and solid foundation is that the main source of national budget revenue comes from enterprises of a socialist nature. In 1954, the proportion of revenue from the state-owned economy in the national budget revenue increased from 62.6 percent in 1953 to 63.58 percent. If we add the payments from the cooperative economy and the joint state-private economy, it accounts for 69.07 percent of the total budget revenue.

    Private industry, commerce, and farmers also have an obligation to pay a portion of taxes to meet the needs of national finance, as part of the state's expenditure on developing the national economy and cultural education, consolidating national defense, and administrative management. At the same time, the state uses taxation to facilitate the socialist transformation of private capitalist enterprises and agriculture. Nevertheless, the proportion of taxes paid by agriculture and private industry and commerce in the 1954 national budget has decreased compared to 1953, accounting for only 28.83 percent of the total national budget revenue. The proportion has obviously decreased. It should be pointed out that the proportion alone cannot fully explain the problem. In fact, the vast majority of taxes paid by private industry and commerce are borne by consumer groups, primarily workers and farmers.

    The main source of budget revenue is based on the continuous development of production and the national economy, which is another sign of the solid foundation of our budget.

    In our country, production is to meet the growing material and cultural needs of the people. There is no crisis in the national economy here at all, but rather a continuous rise. The distribution of the main part of the national income is entirely for the purpose of rapidly expanding reproduction and improving the welfare of the people. Therefore, this ensures the continuous development of our national economy.

    This has been proven not only in theory but also in practice. In recent years, the growth rate of China's total industrial and agricultural output value and commodity turnover has been very large. The total industrial output value of the country in 1952 increased by about 28 percent compared to 1951; the total grain output increased by 14 percent, and cotton increased by 24 percent; the total sales value of state-owned commercial enterprises increased by 62 percent. It is estimated that the total industrial and agricultural output value of the country in 1953 increased by 11.4 percent compared to 1952 (calculated at constant prices), and the total retail sales of domestic trade are expected to increase by about 20 percent. In 1954, the total industrial and agricultural output value will increase by 12.6 percent compared to 1953, and the total retail sales of commodities will increase by 13.8 percent. While the national economy is growing, product costs are also systematically decreasing. The targets for cost reduction in various departments in 1954 are: a reduction of 5.2 percent for state-owned and local state-owned industries, a reduction of 5.3 percent for railway transportation, an effort to reduce construction and installation costs in capital construction by 8 percent, and a reduction of 13.7 percent in the circulation rate of state-owned commercial trade. The expansion of production scale and the reduction of costs provide the state with huge, reliable, and solid financial resources.

    On the basis of production development, the material and cultural life of the working people has also been further improved and enhanced. In 1953, the purchasing power of the entire society increased by 20 percent. In 1954, the purchasing power of the entire society will increase by 13.8 percent. On the basis of the continuous increase in the income of the working people, the production enthusiasm of the working people will also continue to increase. The continuous increase in the production enthusiasm of the working people is a reliable factor for the continuous development of our national economy.

    II

    Due to the reliability and solidity of the budget foundation, it is guaranteed that my country's budget revenue will increase every year. If the national budget revenue in 1950 is taken as 100, then it was 204.63 in 1951, 272.6 in 1952, 369.72 in 1953 (including the surplus from the previous year), and 395.64 in 1954 (including the accumulated surplus from the previous year) [Note 1]. The national budget revenue in 1954 increased nearly four times compared to 1950. The increase in national budget revenue is based on the priority growth of payments from the state-owned economy and the cooperative economy, while the taxes paid by private industry, commerce, and farmers are relatively reduced. This situation is in line with the economic development of my country's transition period. The law of growth of national budget revenue is shown in the following table:

    Year 	1950	1951	1952	1953	1954 (Plan)
    State-owned enterprise and cooperative payments as a % of national income 	34.08	49.35	56.33	66.31 [Note 2]	69.07 [Note 3]
    Farmers' payments as a % of national income 	29.63	18.17	17.08	13.48	13.43
    Private industry and commerce payments as a % of national income 	32.93	28.66	24.06	17.02	15.40

    The growth of budget revenue is due to the priority growth of payments from the state-owned economy and the cooperative economy, which guarantees the timely allocation of funds for various measures stipulated in the national economic plan, making it possible to use a large amount of monetary funds to develop the national economy and improve the material and cultural living standards of residents, in order to achieve the state's general task in the transition period.

    III

    The growth of national budget revenue not only adapts to but also exceeds the growth of budget expenditure. Our budget not only has no deficit, but also has a surplus in execution every year. For example, the execution of the national budget in 1952 had a surplus of more than 30 trillion yuan, the balance at the end of 1953 was 428,270 billion yuan, and the approved number for 1954 shows that revenue exceeds expenditure by 252,508 billion yuan.

    Budgetary balance is a necessary condition for the planned development of our national economy. At the same time, the planned development of the national economy also ensures the mutual adaptation of our budgetary revenue and expenditure. Therefore, budgetary balance is a characteristic that our budget inevitably possesses, and it is also a characteristic that our budget has in contrast to the budgets of capitalist countries. The budgetary revenue and expenditure of our country are organically linked and mutually constrained. The increase in national budget expenditure will inevitably promote the further development of the national economy and the continuous expansion of national income, and thus budget revenue will also grow accordingly. Accompanied by the growth of budget revenue, national budget expenditure can only be increased. Without a reliable and solid source of budget revenue, large-scale capital payments would lack the necessary guarantee, and without the rational allocation and economical use of budget expenditure and the development of the national economy, the increase and consolidation of budget revenue would become impossible.

    At the same time, in order to achieve the tasks of the national budget, it is also necessary to adhere to the principle of budgetary balance. The compilation of our budget is not like the budget of capitalist countries, which adopts the method of determining income based on expenditure, but is carried out with a balanced principle that takes into account both determining income based on expenditure and determining expenditure based on income. This ensures that the national budget has greater reliability and stability.

    The balance of the national budget and the excess of revenue over expenditure promote the consolidation of currency circulation in our country, the increase in the purchasing power of the renminbi, the stable development of national finance, and the smooth completion of the national economic plan.

    IV

    In capitalist countries, the situation is completely opposite. The foundation of their budgets is not solid.

    In the capitalist countries of the imperialist era, the entire activities of their countries are completely subordinate to the interests of monopoly organizations, and the source of national budget revenue is based on taxation. Marx said: The existence of the bourgeoisie "state in economic terms is taxation." (Marx: Moral Criticism) Now, residents' taxes in bourgeois countries often account for more than 90 percent of the budget of capitalist countries. The vast majority of this is not the staggering profits of monopoly capitalists, but the steadily declining income of the broad masses of working people. Taxes deprive the working class of one-third to one-half of their wage income and increase year by year. In the United States, the tax burden on low-income taxpayers increased fourfold from 1939 to 1948, while the tax burden on high-income taxpayers decreased by 44 percent [Note 4]. The American people now have to spend 6.875 billion US dollars every year just to pay the interest on the national debt, which exceeds the total administrative expenses of all departments of the US government (excluding the Department of Defense) [Note 5].

    Since the budget revenue of capitalist countries is obtained from outside the scope of production through extra exploitation, its foundation is not solid. This inherently unstable budget foundation, coupled with the periodic crises of the capitalist economy, the existence and growth of a large number of unemployed workers, and the sharp decline in the wages of employed workers, makes the national budget foundation even more shaky.

    Although the scale of capitalist countries' budgets is also constantly expanding, it is caused by the primary growth of budget expenditure determined by huge military expenditures and the maintenance costs of state violence organs. The growth of such expenditure is non-productive, and therefore makes budget revenue and expenditure incompatible. Budget expenditure is often greater than its revenue, and chronic deficits are the inevitable result of the development of capitalist countries' budgets, a clear sign of the decay of the capitalist economic system, and also an important factor that promotes the further intensification of the inherent contradictions of capitalism. In the thirty-five years from 1914 to 1948, there were twenty-four deficit budgets in the United States [Note 6]. The deficit budget has become more serious and widespread in recent years. In the 1951-1952 fiscal year in the United States, the deficit was more than 4 billion US dollars, but in the 1952-1953 fiscal year, the deficit jumped to more than 9.3 billion US dollars. In the first half of the 1953-1954 fiscal year (until the end of December 1953), the deficit was as high as more than 9 billion US dollars. [Note 7]

    The sharp increase in the budget deficit of capitalist countries is a concentrated manifestation of the unstable budget of capitalist countries. The budget deficit brings capitalist countries unstable and volatile currency circulation, as well as the further impoverishment of the working people.

    V

    However, it is incorrect to assume that the foundation of our budget is reliable and solid, and therefore take a carefree attitude towards the execution of the national budget. All the people and governments at all levels, financial institutions, and enterprises should actively strive to collect all kinds of income in a timely and complete manner, and strictly economize on the use of budget funds. The completion of the national economic plan and the tax plan, strengthening financial supervision and strict financial discipline, are of great significance to the realization of this task.

    The national economic plan is the guide for our national economic activities. It guides the planned development of various economic activities and makes them conform to the requirements of the state's general task, and advances victoriously along the road of socialism. The completion of the quantitative and qualitative targets of the national economic plan can guarantee the realization of the national budget revenue plan. For example, the completion of the cost plan ensures that state-owned enterprises realize the task of paying profits to the budget, and the completion of the production and sales plan is the primary condition for realizing the state's commodity circulation tax plan and goods tax plan, and so on. Therefore, it is necessary to fully mobilize the broad masses of workers and people, continue to implement the increase production and practice economy campaign, strengthen enterprise financial management, strive to increase output, improve quality, and under the conditions of increasing output and improving quality, reduce the cost of products, complete and overfulfill the national economic plan.

    To ensure the completion of the national economic plan and the consolidation of the budget foundation, it is also necessary to strengthen financial supervision and strict financial discipline. Financial supervision is of great significance for ensuring the continuous growth of production and improving enterprise management. State financial supervision is mainly carried out by financial institutions and banks in the process of mobilizing revenue and allocating funds. Supervision in the execution of the budget should promote enterprises to complete their own production, sales, cost and profit plans, complete their own payment tasks in a timely and complete manner, and effectively use funds.

    Therefore, to ensure the realization of the budget, it is necessary to ensure that the national budget revenue and expenditure are completed according to plan. This requires the joint efforts of financial institutions, enterprise departments, business departments, and the people of the whole country. Any irresponsible attitude towards the national budget will affect the realization of the national budget to varying degrees; either exceeding the amount of budget expenditure in this part, or reducing the amount of budget revenue in that part, and the result will be to undermine the national budget. Of course, we have this objective possibility, and under the correct leadership of the Party and the government, and with the joint efforts of the people of the whole country, we will certainly have the confidence to turn this possibility into reality.

    我国国家预算是建立在可靠的、稳妥的基础上
    王镜芝
    在国家过渡时期总任务光辉照耀下所制订的一九五四年度国家预算，已经中央人民政府委员会第三十一次会议批准了。一九五四年国家预算充分反映了党和政府进一步发展国民经济，保证重工业优先增长的政策，反映了党和政府对提高居民的物质文化生活水平的关怀，并保证国防力量的巩固和加强。
    一
    一九五四年国家预算的特点，是收支建立在可靠的、稳妥的基础上。
    国家预算建立在可靠的、稳妥的基础上的主要标志之一，是国家预算收入的主要来源，来自社会主义性质的企业收入。一九五四年国营经济缴款在国家预算收入中所占的比重，已由一九五三年的百分之六二点六，增长到百分之六三点五八。假使加上合作社经济和公私合营经济的缴款，那末，就占到预算总收入的百分之六九点○七。
    私营工商业和农民，为了满足国家财政的需要，它们也有义务缴纳一部分税款作为国家发展国民经济和文化教育，巩固国防和行政管理的一部分支出。同时，国家借助税收也有利于对私人资本主义企业和农业进行社会主义的改造。虽然如此，一九五四年国家预算中农业和私营工商业所缴的税款所占的比重，比一九五三年已有减少，只为国家预算总收入的百分之二八点八三。比重显然下降了。应该指出：单单从比重还不能全部说明问题，实际私营工商业所缴纳的税款，绝大部分由消费群众首先是工人农民所负担的。
    预算的主要收入来源是建立在生产和国民经济不断发展的基础上，是我预算基础稳固的又一个标志。
    在我国，生产是为了满足人民日益增长的物质和文化需要，这里的国民经济根本没有危机，而是不断地上升。国民收入主要部分的分配，完全是为了迅速扩大再生产和提高人民的福利。因此，这就保证了我国国民经济的不断发展。
    这不但从理论上而且从实践中都已得到了证明。几年来我国工农业总产值和商品流转额的增长比例都是很大的。全国工业生产总值一九五二年比一九五一年约增加百分之二八；粮食总产量增加了百分之一四，棉花增加了百分之二四；国营商业销售总值增加了百分之六二。一九五三年比一九五二年全国工农业总产值预计增加了百分之一一点四
  （按不变价格计算），国内贸易的商品零售总额预计增长约百分之二○。一九五四年工农业的总产值，将比一九五三年增长百分之一二点六，商品零售总额将增加百分之一三点八。在国民经济增长的同时，产品成本也在系统的降低。一九五四年各部门降低成本的指标是：国营及地方国营工业降低百分之五点二，铁道交通运输降低百分之五点三，基本建设中的施工安装费用争取降低百分之八，国营商业贸易流通费率降低百分之一三点七。生产规模的扩大和成本的降低给国家提供了巨大、可靠和稳固的财政资源。
    在生产发展基础上，劳动人民的物质文化生活也有了进一步的改善和提高。一九五三年整个社会购买力提高百分之二十。一九五四年整个社会购买力将提高百分之十三点八。在劳动人民收入不断提高的基础上，劳动人民的生产积极性也就不断地提高。劳动人民生产积极性的不断提高，是我国国民经济不断发展的可靠的因素。
      二
    由于预算基础的可靠和稳固，就保证我国预算收入每年都有增长。假使以一九五○年国家预算收入为一○○，则一九五一年为二○四点六三，一九五二年为二七二点六，一九五三年为三六九点七二（其中包括上年结余），一九五四年为三九五点六四（包括上年积余在内）〔注一〕。一九五四年国家预算收入较一九五○年增加将近四倍。国家预算收入增长是建立在国营经济和合作社经济缴款的优先增长，私营工商业及农民缴纳的税款则相对的降低。这种情况是和我国过渡时期经济发展相适应的。国家预算收入增长规律见下表：年　度一九五○一九五一一九五二一九五三一九五四（计划）国营企业和合作社缴款占国家收入的％三四点○八四九点三五五六点三三六六点三一〔注二〕六九点○七〔注三〕农民缴款占国家收入的％二九点六三一八点一七一七点○八一三点四八一三点四三私营工商业缴款占国家收入的％三二点九三二八点六六二四点○六一七点○二一五点四○预算收入的增长是由于国营经济和合作社经济缴款的优先增长，这就保证了国民经济计划所规定各项措施的及时拨款，使得有可能以大量的货币资金用来发展国民经济和提高居民的物质和文化生活水平，以实现国家在过渡时期的总任务。
    三
    国家预算收入的增长不但适应而且还超过预算支出的增长。我国预算不但没有赤字，并且每年在执行中还有节余。比如，一九五二年国家预算的执行，盈余在三十万亿元以上，一九五三年年终为止，结余四二八、二七○亿元，一九五四年批准数收入超过支出为二五二、五○八亿元。
    预算收支平衡是我国国民经济有计划发展所必须具备的条件。同时，国民经济有计划的发展也保证了我国预算收支的相互适应。所以预算收支平衡是我国预算必然具有的特点，同时也是我国预算对资本主义国家预算所具有的特点。我国预算收支本身是有机联系和相互制约的。国家预算支出的增加，就必然促使国民经济的进一步发展和国民收入的不断扩大，因而预算收入也就随之增长。伴随预算收入的增长，国家预算支出才有可能增加。没有可靠和稳固的预算收入来源，大规模的资金支付就缺乏应有的保证，而没有预算支出的合理分配和节约的使用以及国民经济的发展，预算收入的增加和巩固也就成为不可能。
    同时，为了实现国家预算的任务，也必须坚持收支平衡的原则。我国预算的编制不是像资本主义国家预算一样，采用量出为入的办法，而是以量出为入和量入为出兼顾的平衡原则进行的。这就保证国家预算有更大的可靠和稳固性。
    国家预算的平衡和收入超过支出就促使我国货币流通的巩固，人民币购买力的提高，国家财政稳固的发展，以及国民经济计划顺利的完成。
    四
    在资本主义国家，情形完全相反。它们预算的基础是不巩固的。
    在帝国主义时代的资本主义国家，它们国家的全部活动完全服从于垄断组织的利益，它们国家预算收入的来源建立在税收的基础上。马克思说：资产阶级“国家表现在经济上的存在，就是税收。”（马克思：道德的批评）现在资产阶级国家的居民税收经常占到资本主义国家预算的百分之九十以上。其绝大部分不是垄断资本家的骇人的庞大利润，而是广大劳动人民的日见下降的收入。税收剥夺了工人阶级工资收入的三分之一到二分之一，并且逐年增加。在美国，低收入纳税人口部分的纳税额从一九三九年到一九四八年增加了四倍，而高收入纳税人口部分的纳税额减少了百分之四十四〔注四〕。美国人民现在单单为了支付国债的利息每年就得花费六十八亿七千五百万美元，这个数目超过美国政府各部（国防部在外）行政经费的总和〔注五〕。
    由于资本主义国家预算收入是从生产范围以外通过额外剥削形式取得的，故其基础是不巩固的。这种本来就不巩固的预算基础，加上资本主义经济的周期性危机，大量失业工人的存在和增长，以及在业工人工资的急剧下降，就使得国家预算基础更加动摇。
    资本主义国家预算的规模虽然也在不断的扩大，但是它是由庞大的军事开支及国家暴力机关维持费所决定的预算支出的首先增长引起的，这种支出的增长是非生产性的，因而就使得预算收支不相适应。预算支出经常大于其收入，慢性赤字是资本主义国家预算发展的必然结果，是资本主义经济制度腐朽的明显标志，同时也是促使资本主义内在矛盾进一步尖锐化的重要因素，从一九一四年到一九四八年的三十五年过程中，赤字预算在美国有二十四次〔注六〕。赤字预算在近几年来发展更为严重和普遍。美国在一九五一—一九五二财政年度，赤字为四十亿余美元，到了一九五二—一九五三财政年度，赤字即跃至九十三亿余美元。在一九五三—一九五四财政年度的头半年中（到一九五三年十二月底），赤字就高达九十亿余美元。〔注七〕
    资本主义国家预算赤字的急剧增加，是资本主义国家预算不巩固的集中表现。预算赤字带给资本主义国家的是货币流通的不稳定和动摇，以及劳动人民的进一步贫困化。
    五
    但是，假使认为我国预算基础是可靠的，稳固的，因而对国家预算的执行抱着万事大吉的态度，这是不正确的。全体人民和各级政府、财政机关、企业单位应该积极努力使各项收入及时和全部收进，并严格节约使用预算资金。而完成国民经济计划和税收计划，加强财政监督和严格财政纪律，对实现这项任务有很重要的意义。
    国民经济计划是我国国民经济活动的指针，它指导着各种经济的活动有计划地发展，并使之符合于国家总任务的要求，胜利地沿着社会主义的道路前进。国民经济计划数量指标和质量指标的完成，就能保证国家预算收入计划的实现。比如，成本计划的完成，就保证国营企业实现对预算所负担的利润缴纳任务，而生产和销售计划的完成，则是实现国家商品流通税计划、货物税计划的首要条件等等。因此，就必须充分动员广大职工和人民，继续贯彻增产节约运动，加强企业财务管理，努力增加产量，提高质量，并在增加产量和提高质量的条件下，降低产品的成本，完成和超额完成国民经济计划。
    保证国民经济计划的完成和预算基础的巩固，还必须加强财政监督，严格财政纪律。财政监督对保证生产的不断增长，改善企业经营有重要意义。国家财政监督主要是通过财政机关和银行在动员收入和拨付资金过程中进行的。预算执行中的监督应该促使企业完成本身的生产、销售、成本和利润等计划，及时和全部的完成本身的缴纳任务，并有效的使用资金。
    所以，保证预算的实现，就要保证国家预算收支按计划完成。这就需要财政机关、企业部门、业务部门以及全国人民的共同努力。任何对国家预算采取不负责任的态度，都会在各种不同的程度上影响国家预算的实现；或者是在这一部分突破了预算支出的数目，或者是在那一部分削减了预算收入的数目，而其结果都会破坏国家预算。当然，我们既有这种客观可能性，在党和政府的正确领导，以及全国人民共同努力下，就一定有信心把这种可能性变为现实性。
