    Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant Factory Building Construction Basically Completed
    The last part of the civil engineering construction project of the Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant - the measuring tool workshop, the central water tower, and the office building - has been basically completed. Now, the scaffolding used for the construction of these projects has been removed, and the light yellow color of the newly painted building exterior contrasts with the towering top of the water tower, appearing particularly magnificent and pleasing to the eye in the summer sun. From the outside, there is little activity of construction workers on the site. Only a few workers are still working on the final small part of the roof project at the top of the water tower. The installation project of the measuring tool workshop has begun, and the factory roads are under construction. The previously completed production workshops have also been handed over to the production departments one after another. All signs indicate that this factory, equipped with first-class technology for manufacturing precision tools, will soon be fully completed.
    The factory building construction project of the Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant officially started in May 1953. By the end of 1953, the construction projects of the tool workshop, the cutting tool workshop, the woodworking workshop, and other buildings had been basically completed. In order to speed up the construction of the factory, under the advice and assistance of Soviet experts, this factory carried out winter construction on the final projects of the factory area, such as the measuring tool workshop, the central water tower, and the office building in the winter of 1953. After the measuring tool workshop, the central water tower, and the office building projects entered the summer construction phase on April 15 this year, the project entered a more complex and tense stage. In order to complete the final construction project of the factory area as soon as possible, all the staff and workers on the site gave full play to their initiative and creativity. Masons, carpenters, steelworkers, and concrete workers did more work every day than usual in the construction of the upper part of the water tower. Masons completed the bricklaying task, which usually took four days, in just two days. The workers in the Dong Houzeng team, who were always known for their high enthusiasm for work, seemed fascinated by the work, and they were reluctant to leave even after the radio station announced the end of work. During the most intense days of the project, the cadres and engineering technicians of the Chinese Communist Party, administrative, trade union, and Communist Youth League organizations on the site almost all went to the site to take charge of various tasks, and it was difficult to find them in the office. Thanks to the efforts of all the staff and workers on the site, the water tower project, which had a complex structure and many floors, progressed rapidly from the fifth floor. Originally, it took twelve days to complete one floor, but as a result, it was completed in only one week. (Xinhua News Agency)

    哈尔滨量具刃具厂厂房建筑工程基本完工
    哈尔滨量具刃具厂厂区最后一部分土木建筑工程——量具厂房、中央水塔和办公大楼，已经基本完工。现在，这些工程施工用的脚手架已经拆除，刚刚粉刷的建筑物外表的淡黄颜色衬托着高耸的水塔塔顶，在夏日的阳光中显得特别壮丽悦目。从外部看，工地上建筑工人的活动已经很少了，只有水塔顶部还有少数工人在进行最后一小部分屋面工程的施工。量具厂房的安装工程已经开始，厂区道路正在修筑。先前完工的生产车间也都先后移交给生产部门。一切景象显示这个用头等技术装备起来的制造精密工具的工厂快要全部建成了。
    哈尔滨量具刃具厂的厂房建筑工程是从一九五三年五月正式开工的。到一九五三年年底，工具厂房、刃具厂房、木工厂房等建筑工程，就已基本完工。为了加快建厂速度，这个厂又在苏联专家的建议和帮助下，在一九五三年冬天对量具厂房、中央水塔和办公大楼等厂区最后工程进行了冬季施工。量具厂房、中央水塔和办公大楼工程今年四月十五日转入夏季施工以后，工程就进入了更为复杂紧张的阶段。为了尽早地完成厂区最后的建筑工程，工地全体职工都发挥了最大的积极性和创造性。瓦工、木工、钢筋工和混凝土工在建筑水塔上部工程中，每天都比往日做出了更多的工作。瓦工只用两天就完成了平常需要四天的砌砖任务。一向以劳动热情高出名的木工董厚增小组工人，像被工作迷住一样，广播站已经宣布下班他们还不愿离开。在工程最紧张的日子里，工地中国共产党、行政、工会和青年团组织的干部和工程技术人员，几乎全部下到工地分头掌握各项工作，在办公室里很难找到他们。由于工地全体职工的努力，结构复杂、层数很多的水塔工程从第五层开始就进展很快，原来一层工程需十二天才能完成，结果只一个星期就完成了。（新华社）
