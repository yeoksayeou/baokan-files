Rural Knowledge Youth Liu Bingwen
Li Gongran

Liu Bingwen is from Fanshen Village, Fourteenth District, Nehe County, Heilongjiang Province, and is twenty-one years old this year. In 1950, he was still in the fifth grade of the district's complete primary school. He dropped out of school and returned home due to family issues and participated in production. Over the past few years, Liu Bingwen has been growing up in labor production and on the road of mutual assistance and cooperation. He is now the director of an agricultural production cooperative, a labor model in Heilongjiang Province, and has honorably joined the Communist Party.

Taking the Road to Common Prosperity

This happened in 1950. During the summer hoeing season, Guo Chunfang, the leading household in Fanshen Village, abandoned Liu Bingwen's family and the poor households of Liu Fengshan and Ni Hongfu in the mutual aid group. Liu Bingwen's father angrily wanted to work alone, saying, "With our two horses and eight *xiang* of land, my son and I can't even manage it all. Why bother messing around with everyone else!" Liu Bingwen then patiently persuaded and educated his father. He said, "Dad, haven't you seen that the grain harvested by Ma Qingfu's mutual aid group across the river is more than ours every year? Those who used to live worse than us are now stronger than us. Besides, if we do it ourselves, with this manpower and equipment, what if there is a natural disaster or illness? Can we manage all this land?..." Once, Liu Bingwen's brother-in-law Ni Hongfu was plastering a wall. Because he was alone, he had to mix the mud and climb the ladder to plaster. He was so busy going up and down that he accidentally slipped and fell from the middle of the ladder. Liu Bingwen's father only had this one son-in-law and was very distressed. At this time, Liu Bingwen said to his father, "If there was a mutual aid group, these jobs could be exchanged, and this wouldn't have happened. Now, what will happen to his land?" After Liu Bingwen's repeated mobilization and persuasion with facts, his father finally agreed to organize a mutual aid group. But his father said that they had to find strong people: "Mutual aid groups are good, but they must have strong people and strong horses. If we include those poor households who have nothing and are burdened with debts, won't we suffer losses!" Liu Bingwen patiently explained again, "Mutual aid groups exchange labor. How can we suffer losses? Besides, we should also think about our past days. Now that we are living a little better, should we abandon the poor households? We can't take the old road of individual prosperity and everyone else suffering. We must take the new road of common prosperity." Later, with the help of the Party branch secretary, Meng Jixin, a five-household mutual aid group was formed, including three poor households. Liu Bingwen was elected as the group leader.

When Liu Bingwen was first elected as the leader of the mutual aid group, he was very flustered. Although he grew up in the countryside, he did not often go to the fields when he was studying, so he was not familiar with farm work. However, general knowledge of farming was easy to learn if he was willing to learn, and he quickly learned it. However, leading a mutual aid group well could not be done with enthusiasm alone.

In the spring of 1951, several disputes occurred in the group in succession. One day, Liu Fengxiang and Zhao Zhongfu argued over unclear work accounts. One said, "You owe me a lot of horse labor," and the other said, "You owe me a lot of human labor." Everyone demanded that the other pay money, arguing until they were red in the face. One morning, the group put the manure on Liu Bingwen's family's cart, but before they reached the manure pile, the wheel came off the axle. It turned out that the "cotter pin" (a small iron pin inserted at the head of the axle to prevent the wheel from falling off) was missing. Liu Bingwen's father saw that his new axle was being worn down, and without any evaluation, he secretly took the "cotter pin" off because he was worried. Then, several other things happened.

Liu Bingwen was very puzzled by these situations. He thought, "Our group is good. We have also established a mutual benefit system, and the scoring and rotation are reasonable. Only my family's cart was not scored, allowing everyone to give whatever they want, but this is my own cart." Why is everyone like this? After thinking carefully, he found the problem: although the mutual benefit system had been established in the past, everyone was not made aware of the importance of earnestly implementing mutual benefit, and the group members still had the idea that "If we are so clear about the mutual aid group, it is not called a mutual aid group." In particular, there were unclear entanglements between relatives, which led to problems.

Liu Bingwen talked to the Party branch secretary about his views on this issue. The branch secretary agreed with his views and personally participated in their group meeting. At the meeting, Liu Bingwen used the events that occurred in the group to illustrate the necessity and importance of conscientiously implementing the mutual benefit system, changed the group members' understanding, and thus established a reasonable mutual benefit system. Later, Liu Bingwen studied the group's work, learned from foreign experience, and also implemented a work point system and a contracting system, which made the mutual aid group even more consolidated.

In the spring and summer of 1951, there was continuous rain, and weeds grew wildly. When they were weeding, the poor households Li Wanjin, Li Tianzhong, and Yu Ruifu were squeezed out by Zhang Anying's group again. Seeing that the land was about to become barren, they came to Liu Bingwen's group for help. Liu Bingwen and the group members discussed it, but it was first opposed by the two households with horses, Liu Fengxiang and Zhao Zhongfu. Liu Bingwen asked the mutual aid group to discuss two questions he raised: one was how Zhao Zhongfu's life had become better than in the past; and the other was who had benefited or suffered losses among the households with and without horses in the group. The result of the discussion was that everyone agreed that Zhao Zhongfu was getting worse every year when he worked alone. If he did not participate in the mutual aid group, he would not have a good life. In 1950, the group harvested more grain, and he bought that horse. There is a mutual benefit system in the group, and everyone does not suffer losses by exchanging labor. Finally, the mutual aid group agreed to send two sets of plowing manpower and horses to help Li Wanjin and the others weed and also agreed to their request to join the group. Soon, they also absorbed Guo Haichang, a poor household who came from Shangyi Village in the Third District, into the group.

By 1953, Liu Bingwen's group had sixteen households, most of which were originally poor households. In the spring of this year, Liu Bingwen's group was preparing to establish a cooperative, and Guo Chunfang's group wanted to join the cooperative, which was agreed upon at the time. In the autumn, the county committee approved it, but Guo Chunfang thought that Liu Bingwen's group was poor and did not want to join, but instead wanted to invite Liu Bingwen, Liu Fengxiang, and other wealthier households to his group to establish a cooperative with him. Liu Bingwen sternly refused. At this time, some group members were affected, and their enthusiasm for establishing a cooperative was not high. Liu Bingwen realized that this was a big problem and was determined to establish the cooperative. He promoted the superiority of cooperatives and the bright prospects of the countryside to the group members, explained that his group had the conditions to establish a cooperative, and mobilized the Youth League members and activists to play a backbone role. Finally, with the specific help of the CPC Nehe County Committee and the Fourteenth District Committee, the agricultural production cooperative was successfully established, and its name was "Xinxing" (New Star). Now the members recall the situation at that time and say, "At that time, Liu Bingwen was really determined... This time, we won a victory!"

The Story of Planting Wheat

Last year, the government called for flat sowing and dense planting of wheat and early sowing. The masses in Fanshen Village doubted this new experience: "Can wheat grow without ridges? Early planting will surely be frozen to death." Liu Bingwen took the lead and sowed more than ten days in advance with Guo Haichang and Liu Fenghai, and implemented flat sowing. Soon the seedlings emerged neatly, were strong and sturdy, and green, like a green carpet. The masses praised the wheat seedlings for growing well.

Who knew that when the wheat seedlings grew to more than an inch high, there was suddenly a frost. The wheat seedlings drooped, turned yellow, and lay on the ground, looking like yellow leaves all over the ground in autumn. Some people said sarcastically, "This is the new experience!" Liu Bingwen's father was even more angry: "You don't listen to the old people. Seven *dou* of wheat seeds are wasted." Guo Haichang and Liu Fenghai's thinking also wavered. Liu Bingwen was both angry and anxious and ran to the field several times a day. Seeing that piece of yellow, his heart felt like it was being pricked with needles. He couldn't eat or sleep. He thought, "If the seedlings die, the impact will be very bad!" He also remembered the words of the Party branch secretary: "This is a technical innovation, a struggle against the conservative thinking of the masses... We must think of all ways to set an example." So he went to the wheat field again, pulled the seedlings apart, and saw that there were still green cores. He thought, "They haven't died yet. I will go to the technology promotion station to find a solution." Just as he was about to leave, the rural postman came to deliver the newspaper. He took a copy of the "Heilongjiang Farmer" newspaper, read it for a while, and said to himself, "Covering soybeans with top manure can protect the seedlings. Can't it do the same for wheat? 'Agricultural Technology' also mentioned that applying yellow manure can increase heat... That's right, let's try it." Sure enough, a few days after applying the top manure, the wheat seedlings grew vigorously and turned green, leaving other people's wheat behind again.

The wheat on these three flat-sown plots ripened particularly early, and coincidentally, the wind was strong, so their group had to allocate some manpower to harvest overnight. They borrowed a horse-drawn harvester from Ma Qingfu's cooperative in Xiangyang Village. On the day of the harvest, the village government organized all the mutual aid group leaders and veteran farmers to visit. Many students, women, and old men who had not gone out for many years also came to watch the excitement. Everyone praised this patch of early-maturing new wheat.

On the second night of the rush harvest, people worked continuously for two days and two nights, and their heads were dizzy with fatigue. At this time, the wheat had been harvested, and only some wheat had not been stacked. In the middle of the night, everyone couldn't hold on any longer. Liu Bingwen looked up and saw that the sky was blue, with a few stars twinkling in the distance, and there was no wind at all, so he said, "Okay, let's go home and sleep and work tomorrow."

In the middle of the night, Liu Bingwen was sleeping groggily when he was suddenly awakened by the sound of thunder. A flash of lightning lit up the outside. He looked through the window and saw that the sky was as black as the bottom of a pot, the clouds were so low that they were about to fall, and the wind had picked up. Liu Bingwen remembered that the wheat in the field had not been stacked, so he hurriedly jumped out of bed, went out to ring the bell, and gathered everyone. They walked in the deep and shallow mud, using the flashes of lightning to see. As soon as they reached the field, the wind picked up, and it started to rain. Liu Bingwen commanded like an army commander: "Everyone quickly stack up Liu Fenghai and Guo Haichang's wheat!" Liu Fenghai snatched up and said, "Your family's hasn't been stacked either. Let's split up into two groups and do it." Liu Bingwen decisively said, "Splitting into two groups will disperse our strength. Let's stack up his two families' wheat first." All the wheat was almost stacked, and the heavy rain poured down. Everyone looked at Liu Bingwen's wheat, which had been drenched, and on the one hand, they felt pity, and on the other hand, they were filled with admiration and gratitude for Liu Bingwen.

In the Grain Purchase Work

In October 1952, the Youth League was established in Fanshen Village, Liu Bingwen was approved as a formal Youth League member and was elected as the deputy secretary of the branch.

The grain purchase work began. Liu Bingwen was responsible for the grain purchase task in Xinmintun (where Liu Bingwen's family lived). Liu Bingwen first persuaded his father to sell all of his seventeen *shi* of surplus grain to the state.

Liu Bingwen's father-in-law, Meng Qinglin, had surplus grain at home. After several people went to mobilize him, he still did not sell it. One afternoon, Liu Bingwen went to Meng Qinglin's house under the pretext of visiting. Liu Bingwen wanted to find out how much surplus grain he had, so he consciously chatted about everything else; Meng Qinglin also said it unintentionally. After chatting for a long time, Liu Bingwen calculated in his heart that there were more than eight *shi* of surplus grain, so he asked Meng Qinglin:

"How much grain are you selling?"

"I don't have any surplus grain. I'm your relative. If I don't sell some, it won't be easy for you to do your job. I'll sell 200 *jin*." Meng Qinglin saw Liu Bingwen frown and didn't say anything, so he gritted his teeth, "I'll sell 300 *jin*!"

"You've been listening to the meetings in the village these days. Our country is moving in the direction of the Soviet Union. At that time, farming will be done with machines, and the grain will be as high as mountains, and life will be happy. But to live such a life, we have to do many things. Selling the surplus grain to the state is an important thing. You think that's right, don't you?" Liu Bingwen chatted casually without minding.

"Yes! Yes!" Meng Qinglin nodded repeatedly.

"Besides, the state buys grain at a reasonable price, giving whatever we want. We ordinary people don't suffer any losses, do we?"

"Not a bit of loss!" Meng Qinglin said earnestly.

"We have surplus grain, but it won't produce more at home. It will spoil and deteriorate if it's left for a long time. If we sell it to the state, buy horses and add carts, and turn dead money into living money, it will be good for both the country and ourselves."

"That's right!"

"It would be great if you sold more than eight *shi* of surplus grain to the state and bought a big horse!"

After Liu Bingwen's patient persuasion, Meng Qinglin's heart was finally moved, but he still didn't say how much to sell. Liu Bingwen encouraged him for a few words and then went home.

On his way home, Liu Bingwen passed by the house of his second uncle-in-law, Meng Qingtian. Seeing that the lights were still on in the house, he peeked through the crack in the door and became angry—Meng Qingtian was hoarding grain. The next day, Liu Bingwen reported the situation to the Party branch. The branch secretary personally went to mobilize them with Liu Bingwen. In the end, Meng Qinglin sold more than eight *shi* of grain to the state, and Meng Qingtian also sold the more than two *shi* of grain that he had hoarded. In this way, the entire *tun* was quickly promoted to complete the grain purchase task.

Soon, Liu Bingwen participated in the Party rectification study, further improved his class consciousness, and honorably joined the Communist Party of China. He said, "From then on, my goal became clearer. When I encounter difficulties in my work, I remember the day I raised my hand to take the oath to join the Party, and I am filled with strength!"

× × ×

Liu Bingwen is continuing to move forward. This April, he received an award from the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League and was awarded the title of "Excellent Youth League Member." After receiving the award, he said, "My contribution to the people is too small. Even if I have made some achievements, it is due to the leadership of the Party and the support of the masses. But the Party and the people have given me honor, and I feel a little uneasy in my heart. I will never be arrogant, because I know that this is the Party and the people's encouragement to me. I will certainly live up to the Party's expectations, further improve the cooperative, and strive for greater glory!"

He is strictly fulfilling his promise. This year, 85 percent of their cooperative's more than one hundred *xiang* of land (with about twenty *xiang* of new wasteland) is stubble, and the farming technology has also been improved. While spring plowing is still in full swing, they are already planning summer weeding production: how to improve labor organization, how to thin seedlings, and how to carry out competitions.... They are working hard to achieve the cooperative's plan to increase grain production by eight hundred *shi*. We believe that Liu Bingwen will continue to move forward and make greater achievements.

    农村知识青年刘秉文
    李公然
    刘秉文是黑龙江省讷河县十四区翻身村人，今年二十一岁。一九五○年他还在本区完全小学五年级读书，因为家庭问题休学回家，参加了生产。几年来，在劳动生产中，在互助合作的道路上，刘秉文正在成长起来。他现在是一个农业生产合作社的主任，黑龙江省的劳动模范，并已光荣地参加了共产党。
    走大家富裕的路
    这是一九五○年的事。正在夏锄的时候，翻身村的头等户郭春芳把互助组里的刘秉文家和贫困户刘凤山、倪洪福三家甩了。刘秉文的爹一怒而要单干，他说：“咱两匹马，八垧地，爹儿俩还莳弄不过来，何必跟大伙一块乱蹼蹬！”刘秉文就向爹进行了耐心的说服教育。他说：“爹，你没看见，河那边马庆福互助组打的粮食，那年不比咱们多。原先日子过得不赶咱们的，如今都比咱们强了。再说，我们自己干，凭这人马刀枪，一旦有个天灾病药的，这些地能莳弄过来吗？……”有一次，刘秉文的妹夫倪洪福抹墙，因为是一个人，又要弄泥浆，又要爬梯子抹，上来下去地忙得不可开交，不慎从梯子的半中腰滑跌下来了。刘秉文爹只有这一个女婿，很心疼。这时刘秉文对爹说：“要是有互助组，这些活可以换工做，就不会出这码事。这下他的地咋办？”经过刘秉文的反复动员和用事实来说服教育，他爹才同意了组织互助组。但他爹说要硬找硬：“互助组倒是好，可得人硬马硬才行。和那些什么也没有，还拉了一屁股饥荒的穷户插组，咱们还不得吃亏！”刘秉文又耐心地解释说：“互助组人马换工，怎能吃亏呢。再说，也应当想想咱们过去的日子；今天咱们日子过好了点，就把贫困户扔在一边？咱们不能走个人发财大伙受苦的旧路，咱们一定要走大家富裕的新路。”后来，在党支部书记孟继信的帮助下，组成了一个五户的互助组，其中三户是贫困户。刘秉文被选为组长。
    刘秉文当选互助组长之初，心里很慌。他虽然是在农村长大的，由于念书时不常下地，对庄稼活还不熟。但种地的一般知识，只要肯学，倒还容易，他很快就学会了。可是，要领导好一个互助组，却不是单凭热情能行的。
      一九五一年春天，组里接连发生了几件纠纷。一天，刘凤祥和赵忠福因工账不清吵起来了。这个说，你欠我不少马工，那个说，你欠我很多人工；大家都要求对方补钱，吵得脸红脖子粗的。又一天早晨，组里套上刘秉文家的车送粪，还没走到粪堆，车轮出轴了。一看，“别头针”（车轴头上插的一个小铁棍，管车轮不掉的）没有了。原来刘秉文的爹看到自己的新车轴给磨得精细，也没评分，一心疼就偷着把“别头针”拿下来了。接着，还发生了另外几件事。
    刘秉文看到这些情况，很是纳闷。他想，咱组不错，也订了互利制度，评分、轮作都合理；就只我家的车没评分，让大家随便怎样给好，但这是我自己家的车呀。为什么大伙这样呢？他仔细一想，才找到了问题的所在：过去虽然订了互利制度，但没有使大家了解切实搞好互利的重要性，组员还存在着“互助组嘛，分得那么清还叫互助组”的思想。特别是亲戚之间纠缠不清，以致发生了问题。
    刘秉文向党支部书记谈了自己对这个问题的看法。支部书记同意他的看法；并亲自参加了他们的小组会。在会上刘秉文用组里发生的事情，说明认真实行互利制度的必要性和重要性，改变了组员的认识，从而建立了合理的互利制度。以后，刘秉文研究了组的工作，学习外地经验，又实行了工票制度，包工制度，互助组就更巩固了。
      一九五一年的春夏之交，阴雨连绵，野草丛生。正铲地时，贫困户李万金、李天仲、于瑞福又被张安英组挤了出来。眼看地要荒了，他们来找刘秉文组帮助。刘秉文和组员们一商量，首先遭到了有马户刘凤祥和赵忠福两户的反对。刘秉文让互助组讨论他提出的两个问题：一个是赵忠福的日子较过去好了些是怎么来的；一个是组内有马户和无马户有谁占了便宜或吃了亏。讨论的结果，一致认为：赵忠福单干的时候，一年不如一年，他要不参加互助组，好日子是得不到的。一九五○年，组里多打了粮食，他才买了那匹马。组内有互利制度，人马换工，大家都不吃亏。最后，互助组同意去两付犁的人马，帮助李万金他们铲趟，还同意了他们入组的要求。不久，他们又吸收了从三区尚义村投奔来的贫困户郭海昌入了组。
    到一九五三年，刘秉文组已有十六户，这些户原来绝大多数是贫困户。这年春天，刘秉文组准备建社，郭春芳组要参加社，当下商量好了。到秋季，县委批准了，可是郭春芳嫌刘秉文组穷，又不愿参加了，反而想邀刘秉文、刘凤祥等较富裕的户到他组里去，和他一起建社。刘秉文严厉地拒绝了。这时有些组员受了影响，建社的情绪不高。刘秉文认识到这是一个很大的问题，决心要把社建立起来。他向组员宣传了合作社的优越性和农村的光明远景，讲清了自己组具备了建社条件，并且发动团员、积极分子起骨干作用，最后，终于在中共讷河县委、十四区委的具体帮助下，农业生产合作社胜利地成立起来了，名字叫“新兴”。现在社员回忆那时的情形说：“那时刘秉文真坚决，……这回算打了个胜仗！”
    种麦的故事
    去年，政府号召小麦平播密植，提前播种。翻身村的群众都怀疑这新经验：小麦没垅那行？早种还当不了冻死。刘秉文带头和郭海昌、刘凤海三家提前十多天播种，并实行了平播。不久小苗出齐了，又茁又壮，绿油油的，像一张绿毛毯似的。群众都夸奖麦苗长得好。
    谁知，在麦苗长到一寸多高的时候，忽然下了一场霜。麦苗搭了头，黄了，趴在地上，看去像秋天的满地黄叶。有些群众说开风凉话了：“这才是新经验呢！”刘秉文的爹更加生气：“你不听老人的话，七斗多麦种白瞎了。”郭海昌、刘凤海的思想也都动摇了。刘秉文又是气又是急，一天跑到地里去好几遍，看到那一片黄色，心里像针刺着一样，饭也吃不下，觉也睡不好。他想：“苗要死了，影响多坏呀！”他又想起了党支部书记的话：“这是技术革新，是和群众的保守思想作斗争……必须想一切办法，做出样子。”于是，他又到了麦地，拔开苗一看，还有绿芯。他心想：“还没死，到技术推广站去想办法。”他刚要走，碰到乡邮递员送来了报。他拿过一张“黑龙江农民”报，看了一会，自言自语道：“大豆上盖头粪能保苗，麦子就不能吗？‘农业技术’上也讲过：上黄粪可以增加热力……对，试试看。”果然，上过盖头粪不几天，麦苗就一个劲地长了起来，又茁又绿，把别人的麦又拉下了。
    这三块平播地的麦子熟得格外早，偏巧风又大，他们组不得不分一部分力量来连夜抢收。他们从向阳村马庆福社借来了一台马拉收割机。收割那天，村政府组织了全村互助组长和老农来参观，有很多学生、妇女和多年不出门的老头也自动来瞅热闹，大家对这一片早熟的新麦赞叹不已。
    抢收的第二天晚上，人们连着干了两天两夜，困得脑袋“滴哩噹啷”的。这时麦已割完，只有一些麦子还没码上。半夜间，大伙实在支持不住了。刘秉文抬头一看，天空蓝洼洼的，远处有几颗星星在眨巴着眼睛，一点风也没有，就说：“好吧，回家睡觉，明儿再干。”
    半夜里，刘秉文睡得迷迷糊糊，忽然被雷声惊醒，一个闪电把外边照得通亮。他扒窗镜一看，天空像锅底一样漆黑，云低得快要掉下来了似的，风也起来了。刘秉文想起地里的麦子还没码完，急忙跳下炕，出去敲钟召集大伙。他们一脚深一脚浅地借着闪光走，刚到地里，风大起来，开始掉雨点了。刘秉文像指挥军队一样：“大家快把刘凤海、郭海昌的麦子码起来！”刘凤海抢着说：“你家的也没码，咱们分两伙干。”刘秉文斩铁断钉地说：“分两伙会分散力量。先把他两家的码完。”所有的麦子快要码完了，大雨哗哗地下了起来。大伙瞅着被浇了的刘秉文家的麦子，一方面感到惋惜，一方面又都怀着对刘秉文敬佩和感激的心情。
    在购粮工作中
    一九五二年十月，翻身村建团，刘秉文被批准为正式团员，并被选为支部副书记。
    购粮工作开始了。新民屯（刘秉文家所在地）的购粮任务由刘秉文担当起来了。刘秉文首先说服了爹，把自己的十七石多余粮全部卖给了国家。
    刘秉文的老丈人孟庆林，家里有余粮。经过好几个人去动员，他仍不卖。一天下午，刘秉文借口串门到了孟庆林家。刘秉文想了解他到底有多少余粮，就有意识地东拉西扯；孟庆林也就无意中说了。扯了半天，刘秉文在心里一算，有八石多余粮，便问孟庆林：
    “你老卖多少粮？”
    “本来没有余粮，我是你的亲戚，要不卖点，你也不好做工作，卖二百斤吧。”孟庆林见刘秉文皱皱眉头没吱声，一咬牙：“卖三百斤！”
    “这些日子村里开会你老都听着了，咱们国家正在往苏联那个方向走。那时种地都使机器，粮食打得如山，生活过得也幸福。但是要过这样的生活，我们就得作很多事情，把余粮卖给国家就是一件重要事情，你老说对不对？”刘秉文不介意地闲谈着。
    “对！对！”孟庆林连连点头。
    “再说国家买粮价格合理，要啥给啥，我们老百姓一点亏也不吃吧？”
      “一点不吃亏！”孟庆林恳切地说。
      “我们有余粮放在家也不下崽，放时间久了还要坏和糟损。要是把它卖给国家，买马添车，使死财变活财，这样对国家对自己两相当。”
      “是呀！”
      “你老把八石多余粮都卖给国家买一匹大马多好啊！”
    经过刘秉文耐心地劝说，最后孟庆林心活了，但还是没说卖多少。刘秉文鼓励了两句，就回家了。
    刘秉文回家路过二叔丈人孟庆田家，见屋里还点着灯，他扒门缝一看，来气了——孟庆田正在窖粮。第二天，刘秉文向党支部汇报了情况。支部书记亲自和刘秉文到他们两家去动员。最后孟庆林把八石多粮都卖给了国家，孟庆田把窖的两石多粮也卖了。这样一来，推动全屯很快完成了购粮任务。
    不久，刘秉文参加了整党学习，进一步提高了阶级觉悟，光荣地加入了中国共产党。他说：“打这以后，我的目标更明确了，工作遇到困难，一想起入党举手宣誓那天，浑身都是力量！”
          ×　×　×
    刘秉文在继续前进着。今年四月，他受到了青年团黑龙江省委会的奖励，荣获了“优秀团员”的称号。他在受奖以后说：“我对人民的贡献太少了，即或有些成绩，也是由于党的领导和群众的支持才得来的；而党和人民就给我以荣誉，我心里实在有些不安。我绝对不骄傲，因为我知道这就是党和人民对我的鼓励。我一定不辜负党的期望，进一步把社办好，争取更大的光荣！”
    他正在严格地履行着自己的诺言。今年他们社的一百多垧地（有二十来垧新荒），百分之八十五是扣茬，耕作技术也提高了。春耕还正在热烈开展中，他们就已经在核计着夏锄生产了：如何改善劳动组织，怎么间苗，怎样开展竞赛……。他们在为实现全社增产八百石粮食的计划而努力着。我们相信：刘秉文会不断前进，作出更大的成绩。
