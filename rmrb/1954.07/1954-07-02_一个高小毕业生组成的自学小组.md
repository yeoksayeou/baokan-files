    A Self-Study Group Formed by Elementary School Graduates

    In 1953, after Wang Guimei, Jia Mingde, Zhao Shuzhen, Xie Xuezhen, and others graduated from Xita Elementary School in Shenyang City, they did not pass the entrance examination for middle school, and they were too young (all thirteen or fourteen years old) to participate in labor production immediately. On the evening of the day the middle school admission results were announced, they gathered at Wang Guimei's house and decided to form a family self-study group. With the help of the Young Pioneer detachment instructor from their alma mater, they formulated a self-study plan and learning rules, and elected Wang Guimei as the group leader.

    Their self-study activities were well-planned. Initially, they stipulated three hours of self-study time each day to review academic subjects, and Saturday was a collective recreational activity time. During their review, they discussed difficult problems together. In addition to self-studying academic subjects, they also organized extracurricular reading. They pooled their books and magazines, such as "Good Children," "Chinese Young Pioneers," and "The Story of a Drop of Water," to form a small library, and contacted the nearby cultural center to borrow many books. The staff of the cultural center also guided them on how to read these books, further cultivating their interest in reading. After reading books such as "Dedicate Everything to the Party" and "How the Steel Was Tempered," they were greatly educated. In the past, Wang Cailian did not pay enough attention to self-study, believing that "there is no need to study if you don't get into middle school." Since their group organized extracurricular reading, she gradually realized that "cultural knowledge is also needed to participate in labor." Therefore, she studied even harder. Some students used to be unwilling to study arithmetic, feeling that it was very taxing on their brains, but later they realized that whether they go on to further education or participate in labor production, this knowledge is necessary, so they became more enthusiastic about learning arithmetic.

    Currently, they are participating in a supplementary class run by the People's Government, attending classes from 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM every afternoon. Because the supplementary class has few teachers, it cannot provide extracurricular tutoring, and the homework left cannot be graded and checked. Therefore, all members of Wang Guimei's group gather together every day to review, and whoever learns well acts as a "little teacher." At the same time, they also supervise each other's homework, which has a very good effect.

    In addition to self-studying academic subjects and reading extracurricular books, they also pay attention to organizing extracurricular activities. They often listen to the children's programs of the Shenyang People's Broadcasting Station, and organize discussions on important content. They also collectively watched many movies.

    In addition to organizing self-study and recreational activities, their group also appropriately organizes some social labor and household labor that are beneficial to physical and mental health, such as regularly doing odd jobs for the families of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers in the neighborhood, and helping the residents' group clean the streets. They also voluntarily read newspapers and write blackboards in the residents' group, which has been praised by the masses.

    In this way, in their joint study and joint labor, they not only increased their cultural and scientific knowledge, but more importantly, they gradually cultivated new collectiveistic qualities and a love for labor, as well as good habits. After half a year of self-study and various extracurricular activities, they have been able to realize that "in order to build the motherland, going to school is certainly necessary; but if you cannot go to school, participating in labor production is also equally appropriate."

### 一个高小毕业生组成的自学小组

    一个高小毕业生组成的自学小组
    一九五三年，王桂梅、贾明德、赵淑珍、谢学贞等从沈阳市西塔完全小学毕业后，都没有考上中学，年龄又小（都是十三、四岁），一时不能参加劳动生产。在中学发榜那天晚上，她们几个人聚在王桂梅家，共同决定成立了家庭自学小组。在母校少年先锋队的中队辅导员的帮助下，她们制订了自学计划和学习公约，并选出王桂梅为小组长。
    她们的自学活动很有计划。开始一个时期，她们规定每天三个小时的自学时间，复习文化课；星期六是集体文娱活动时间。她们在复习中，有难题大家研究。除去自学文化课以外，她们还组织了课外阅读。她们把自己的书籍、杂志，如“好孩子”、
  “中国少年报”、“一滴水的故事”等集中在一起，成立了一个小图书馆，并跟附近的文化馆取得联系，借来不少书。文化馆的工作人员还指导她们怎样读这些书，进一步培养了她们的读书兴趣。她们在读了“把一切献给党”、“钢铁是怎样炼成的”等书后，受到了很大的教育。过去，王彩莲对自学不够重视，认为“升不上中学就用不着学习了”。自从她们小组组织阅读课外读物以后，她逐渐认识到：“参加劳动也需要有文化知识。”因此，她学得更起劲了。有的学生过去不愿学算术，觉得学算术很费脑筋，后来知道不管今后是升学或参加劳动生产都需要这项知识，因而学算术的劲头也大了。
    目前，她们参加了人民政府办的补习班，每天下午四时到六时上课。补习班因为教师少，不能进行课外辅导，留下的习题也不能批改和检查，因此，王桂梅小组的全体组员就每天都集中在一起复习，谁学得好，就由谁来当“小先生”。同时，还互相督促检查作业，效果很好。
    她们除了自学文化课和阅读课外读物以外，还注意组织课余的活动。她们常常收听沈阳人民广播电台的少年儿童节目，对重要的内容，还组织讨论。她们还集体地看了不少电影。
    她们小组除去组织自学和文娱活动以外，还适当地组织了一些有益于身心健康的社会劳动和家庭劳动，如经常给附近的革命烈士家属、革命军人家属做些零活，和帮助居民组打扫街道等。她们还自动地在居民组里读报，写黑板报，这些都受到了群众的赞扬。
    像这样，她们在共同学习，共同劳动当中，不单是增加了文化科学知识，更重要的是逐渐培养起了集体主义的新品质以及热爱劳动的情感和习惯。经过半年来的自学和各种课外活动，她们已能认识到：“为了建设祖国，升学当然是需要的；但如果不能升学，参加劳动生产同样也是应当的。”
