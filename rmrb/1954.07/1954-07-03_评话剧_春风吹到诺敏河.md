Review of the Drama "Spring Breeze Blows to the Nuomin River"
    Zhao Xun
    Authored by An Bo, Five-Act Play, Published by Writers Publishing House

    The drama "Spring Breeze Blows to the Nuomin River," through the growth process of an agricultural producers' cooperative, depicts the struggle between two lines in implementing the Party's policy of developing the mutual aid and cooperation movement. Represented by Gao Zhenlin, the branch secretary and director of the cooperative, the basically correct policy of active leadership and steady progress was implemented. However, represented by Cui Cheng, the deputy director of the cooperative, the erroneous policy of blind advance and coercion was implemented. Here, the struggle between Gao Zhenlin and Cui Cheng is essentially a struggle between two lines on the issue of middle peasants. The issue of uniting with middle peasants is not a general problem in rural areas, but one of the keys to our success or failure in rural work. The play not only demonstrates the phenomenon of blind advance in the mutual aid and cooperation movement, but also vividly points out the ideological roots that cause this error. This thought of reckless advance, like conservative thought, is a manifestation of subjectivism. The author grasps a theme with universal educational significance from today's rural reality.

    The achievement of this play lies not only in the author's selection of such a meaningful theme, but also in the author's portrayal of some characters with vivid images. The three main characters—Gao Zhenlin, Cui Cheng, and Sun Shoushan—all have a certain degree of typicality. The author has relatively successfully created a bright image of the positive character. Compared with the positive characters written in other plays, "Spring Breeze Blows to the Nuomin River" is a big step forward, and Gao Zhenlin leaves a deep impression on people. The reason why this positive character is written relatively well is that the author vividly depicts the socialist ideological qualities he possesses. When the cooperative was first established, the masses' thinking was still very chaotic, the members were diligent and lazy in varying degrees, the work system had not yet been established, Sun Shoushan's withdrawal from the cooperative caused ideological shaking among some middle peasants, and disagreements among the leaders affected the emotions of the cadres. In the face of this series of difficulties, Gao Zhenlin demonstrated the Communist Party member's spirit of loyalty and responsibility to the people's cause. Of course, he was not without emotional distress and ideological struggle in the face of difficulties. He also thought, "Oh, what's the point! … It makes relatives not relatives, friends not friends, and even Lao Wang has the heart to quit." (Page 94) But:

        Gao Zhenlin: (Sits down, thinks with his head lowered, then,
      after a moment, taps the table lightly with his hand, speaking
    to himself) That's right, everyone has opinions about me because
    my ability is small, and if I have opinions about others, then it's
    because my capacity is not big enough! … (Page 95)

    In this way, Gao Zhenlin strictly demanded himself with the spirit of self-criticism. However, he was generous and principled in treating his comrades. His concern for Cui Cheng's life was almost meticulous, even more thoughtful than Cui Cheng himself. However, on the principled debate on the issue of middle peasants, he was not willing to compromise in the slightest. Although he was also born a peasant, due to the Party's long-term cultivation and education, he had ideologically broken through the limitations of his original class, and he was already accustomed to looking at problems from the perspective of the masses' interests. Once his "Big Iron Cyan" was damaged, and the loss of the horse was not a small matter for ordinary peasants, and others felt sorry for him because of this, but he first thought of the need for the cooperative to establish a responsibility system. He often felt sorry for his wife because he was too busy with the work in the village and the cooperative to manage the housework. This excellent quality of forgetting personal interests for the sake of public interests is precisely a characteristic of advanced figures.

    This socialist ideological quality is not expressed by enumerating external facts or by verbal explanations, but is vividly expressed through the personality of the characters. We are familiar with Gao Zhenlin just like some village cadres we live with day and night in the countryside. He is a person with the characteristics of a peasant, but even more so with advanced thinking. He also has his own family, his own wife and children, and needs to take care of his own life. When we see that although he is very busy, he would rather do more work himself to make his children happy to go fishing, how kind this father's feeling is! When we see that he is bothered by one work difficulty after another, and says a few harsh words to his wife's well-intentioned complaints, and immediately realizes that he shouldn't have done that, how delicately the relationship between husband and wife is written! He has the simple and steady personality of a peasant, and also has the unique humor of a peasant, and even in the face of sharp struggles, he is not so stern and intimidating. For example, when he goes to Sun's house to resolve the family conflict caused by Sun Shoushan's withdrawal from the cooperative, when he engages in a fierce ideological struggle with Cui Cheng, he also shows an approachable and well-meaning attitude. He likes to talk and laugh, so the masses like to get close to him. Contacting the masses and relying on the leadership of the Party is the source of his strength to overcome difficulties. Gao Zhenlin's emotional reminiscence (page 84) is touching. He firmly remembered what Political Commissar Liu told him when he sacrificed: "Lao Gao, if we want to work, we are not afraid of difficulties! How did you get through the snowy mountains and grasslands? Grit your teeth, ask the Party, ask the masses, and any difficulty can be solved!" Facts have proved this truth: today, if we leave the Party and the masses, no heroic figures can be produced.

    The reason why this positive character is written relatively well is also because the author is good at concentrating on using contradictions and conflicts, and fully expressing the characters' thoughts, emotions, and personalities in these contradictions and conflicts. The scene on the stormy night (Act II, Scene 1) is so wonderful and moving, leaving a deep impression on people, because the author correctly adopted this realistic approach. Here, Gao Zhenlin is pushed to the forefront of the contradictions and conflicts, and he becomes the master of the life—the contradictions and conflicts—at that time. Here, problems inside and outside the cooperative, problems inside and outside the Party, problems inside and outside the family, problems between cadres, problems between the masses, and finally, the problem of his own ideological struggle, one problem after another, one layer of difficulty after another, are placed in front of Gao Zhenlin, and he needs to solve them. Thus, in the process of overcoming numerous difficulties, he has been tested and has shown a moving spiritual strength. In this way, the characters are vividly portrayed in sharp contradictions and arduous struggles. However, it is a pity that this method has not been fully utilized in the play. Gao Zhenlin also appears in such occasions: when the problem has already occurred, the struggle has already begun, he uses the correct attitude to solve the dispute as a person who grasps the policy. After Act II, Scene 1, although Gao Zhenlin handled many specific problems, the character's personality did not get further development and enrichment.

    The important problem in the description of Gao Zhenlin's character also lies in his ideological shortcomings. Although he is basically correct in grasping the policy of mutual aid and cooperation, he is not accurate enough in grasping the measure of the issue of middle peasants. Here, some conservative accommodating emotions of the author are looming. This is specifically manifested in Gao Zhenlin's attitude towards Sun Shoushan. Sun Shoushan wanted to withdraw from the cooperative because "the cooperative can't distinguish between those who work hard and those who are lazy, and because the rent for the horse is evaluated too little and the horse feed is taken too much." (Page 67) These problems are not only Sun Shoushan's problems, but also problems that the cooperative should solve at that time. Gao Zhenlin also said: "These are all very important"; but here we do not see Gao Zhenlin's major efforts to persuade Sun Shoushan not to withdraw from the cooperative. On the contrary, he takes a laissez-faire attitude to a certain extent, and only promises him to withdraw freely: "... Don't say a year, you can take another look! Whenever you like it, you can join." Of course, Gao Zhenlin's efforts may not be successful because Sun Shoushan already has plans to pull feet and sell pottery basins to get rich, but wouldn't revealing the essence of his capitalist spontaneous tendency by exposing these superficial reasons be more revealing? In the second act, at the time of summer hoeing, it happened to be raining heavily, and Sun Shoushan had insufficient labor and could not finish hoeing the land. At this time, Gao Zhenlin mobilized everyone to help him. This is not only the cooperative's care for individual households, but also shows the superiority of collective labor. In the face of these vivid facts, it should be a good opportunity to conduct a collective education on individual peasants in politics and ideology, but until the end when Sun Shoushan announced that he wanted to join the cooperative, we still cannot see any significant changes in his original thinking. Gao Zhenlin's basic attitude is more clearly stated by Propaganda Commissioner Wang Yong. Once, two young peasants made a jingle about the quarrel between Dong Fu and Sun Shoushan because each had his own selfish motives when plowing together, and sang it for fun. Wang Yong hurriedly stopped them and said:

        "Who wrote this jingle? How can you write it like this?
    Last time when we planted the land, Secretary (referring to Gao Zhenlin)
    didn't criticize you? He said that our country treats cooperatives, mutual aid groups, and
    individual households the same way, and leads them the same way. You can't mess with people like this,
    it doesn't conform to the policy!" (Page 135)

    Naturally, it is wrong to discriminate against and attack individual households. It is necessary to care for and appropriately take care of them, but due to the different economic nature and different production conditions, it is impossible to "treat the same way and lead the same way" to cooperatives and individual peasants. This is very clear. If we ignore the need to develop production and only seek formal consistency, it does not conform to the policy. The capitalist road is a road that peasants "are used to and familiar with." When realizing the socialist transformation of agriculture, we cannot imagine that there will be no contradictions and struggles with peasants, as Cui Cheng said:

        "... Minister Zhang not only said to unite with them, but also said to transform
    them! Haven't you seen through it in so many years? If you give him an
    inch, he wants you to give him a foot; if you take extra care of him, he still thinks it's
    what he deserves!..." (Page 137)

    Cui Cheng's rude attitude is wrong, but these words are not completely unreasonable. Our purpose of uniting with middle peasants is to lead them to take the socialist road and oppose them from taking the capitalist road. Such unity must have struggle. Although this struggle is measured, it cannot be conceded on principle. In the struggle between Cui Cheng and Sun Shoushan, Cui Cheng is wrong and should be criticized. Gao Zhenlin strictly criticized him, which is right. However, Sun Shoushan's capitalist thinking is even more wrong and should be criticized even more, but it is not criticized enough. This shows that Gao Zhenlin does not pay enough attention to political help to individual peasants in his thinking, and does not fully understand the Party's policy on developing the mutual aid and cooperation movement. Therefore, the play's theme suffers from a lack of depth.

    Sun Shoushan is the best written of the three main characters. The author uses rich peasant language and descriptions of life details to portray a vivid and realistic image of a middle peasant. From Sun Shoushan, we specifically realize the two-sidedness of the middle peasant: on one side, he is a laborer, he loves labor, and he can't stand the wasteland and slack work; he cherishes his livestock, and he feels sorry for his livestock if they eat less. On the other hand, he is a private owner, selfish and conservative, and has a short-sighted vision. He loves his own horse but beats other people's horses. He is selfish and self-interested, but says that the horse feeder Han Si has "a big selfish heart"; he looks at everyone and says that the cooperative is good, so he joins the cooperative, but he is afraid that the collective will harm his personal interests, and he is distressed and wavering, and asks to withdraw from the cooperative. These common characteristics of the class are subtly expressed through Sun Shoushan's personality. The author vividly depicts the various psychological activities of this middle peasant in Act I, Scene 2. This wonderful scene shows the author's high artistic talent in using realistic methods to describe characters. From beginning to end, even every line of dialogue of each character is vivid and meaningful. In particular, the dialogue between Sun Shoushan and his son very appropriately expresses the thoughts and feelings of this middle peasant. For example:

        Sun Shoushan: New farm tools? They can't even use the two hands their mothers left them
    well, let alone new farm tools! But what about us doing it ourselves?
    Going out to pull one more load is two hundred thousand. By autumn, wouldn't three and a half
    horses become one or two? Your Uncle Dong said that selling pottery basins is very
    profitable, so let's do that! ... Look at which family lived a good life early on
    that didn't roll the capital into profit and slowly grow it? (Page 52)

    This is the content of Sun Shoushan's desire for capitalism. Because of this desire, he firmly wants to withdraw from the cooperative. Gao Zhenlin repeatedly comes to him to solicit his opinions, but he doesn't say a word. When Sun Youcai asks him why he doesn't say anything, he teaches his son: "... You are young and don't understand this. Human relations can't fill your stomach! Since I sincerely don't want to join, why should I give him advice!" Since he is not in it himself, he doesn't care whether the cooperative is doing well or badly. This is his individualistic philosophy of life. Even in some small, unnoticed dialogues, the author does not relax in portraying the character's personality. Sun Youcai is upset and unconsciously taps a small copper box on the counter. Sun Shoushan hurriedly went over and snatched the copper box: "Don't tap it, I'm still keeping it to hold rapeseed!" One can imagine the angry mood of a person who cherishes even a small copper box so much when he hears that he is going to exchange his good land. The middle peasant Sun Shoushan created by the author, as a whole (especially in the first half), not only has the characteristics of the class, but also has artistic authenticity.

    However, the thread of thought and emotion of Sun Shoushan, which was described very vividly in Act I, Scene 2, was not developed as it should be later. The author did not pay attention to exploring the law of the development of his inner thoughts and emotions in Sun Shoushan's transformation and joining the cooperative. He only arranged one unfortunate event after another for him and contrasted them with the superiority of the cooperative. This is certainly in line with the truth of life. Aren't the "natural disasters" and "man-made disasters" encountered by Sun Shoushan ("natural disasters" are heavy rain, grass seedlings grow together, insufficient manpower, and hoeing is not timely; "man-made disasters" are that the object of plowing together happened to be the sharp-headed Dong Fu, and selling pottery basins also lost money.) precisely related to the fundamental weaknesses of the small-scale peasant economy? Isn't the superiority of the cooperative and its assistance the power to attract him to join the cooperative? But unfortunately, here they have become isolated life phenomena, and have not been able to be organically linked with the character's inner world. What development and changes have occurred in the inner world of Sun Shoushan, which was so vividly and specifically displayed in Act I, Scene 2, in the series of events that followed? We can't see it very clearly. Therefore, when Sun Shoushan announces that he wants to join the cooperative, it feels a little sudden. The middle peasants move towards collectivization, which is not only the requirement of the theme and policy, but also the law of life development. If the play shows the law of this life development through the portrayal of the characters' psychology, and reveals the internal connection between the life phenomenon and the policy and theme, instead of using the mathematical law of event plus event to promote its transformation, then Sun Shoushan's transformation will have its inevitability.

    Of the three main characters, Cui Cheng is the worst written, but in the first three scenes, this character is still clear in thought, lovable in personality, and leaves a deep impression on people. In the beginning, he was eager to set up a cooperative. Before everyone had fully discussed it, he thought that the masses had no objections. Before the superiors approved it, he had already built the horse shed, and he immediately wanted to pull the horses into the cooperative, showing his subjective and impetuous mood. However, he first ran into a nail with his relative Sun Shoushan. Sun's pulling the horse out of the cooperative aroused Cui Cheng's anger, and he was "so angry that his neck was swollen," but when he saw Sun Shoushan's son Youcai, he instead came to comfort Youcai:

        ... I've been pretty annoyed these past few days too! Sigh! There's no way! For
    the sake of revolutionary work, for the sake of the masses, you have to overcome a little bit! Youcai, I
    don't think you should be upset either. It's not worth it to get sick from being upset. (Page 59)

    Here, not only does Cui Cheng's loyalty to the revolution is demonstrated, but also his care for his comrades. For example:

        ... This is the critical moment! No matter how the family drags its feet, you still
    have to do what you have to do ... Your father is just a bit stubborn, but you still have to struggle if you have to struggle! Of course, you can't not pay attention to the method, but you can't
    be afraid either. What are young people afraid of? If you are afraid of the wolf in front and the tiger in the back, you won't
    be able to accomplish anything. (Page 60)

    These dialogues full of personality and meaning show the many aspects of thoughts and emotions. When people understand Cui Cheng and feel that he is real and lovable, they will understand the correction of his ideological errors more deeply.

    However, Cui Cheng's character gradually changed later. After Act II, he simply appears as an "opposition." Whatever Gao Zhenlin proposes, he opposes, whether it is reasonable or unreasonable. For example, implementing a small-scale contract responsibility system could urge everyone to work more automatically. This approach is obviously in line with Cui Cheng's personality requirements, but he also firmly opposes it. For example, on the issue of attitude towards individual households, according to Cui Cheng's frank personality and trust in his superiors, he himself said that the problem was solved after returning from the district. In principle, Gao Zhenlin's call to help Sun Shoushan in Act III would not have aroused such strong opposition from him, but not only was his attitude not good, but he also wanted to send Sun's family to do corvee labor, which seemed to be intentionally looking for trouble, and even had a bit of revengeful emotion. This description, along with his other careless, blustering, emotional, and individualistic attitudes and styles, makes people feel that Cui Cheng's mistakes are not only
  general ideological problems, but even have problems in character. This is not very consistent with the original play's introduction of "born as a long-term worker," "not one in a thousand, but one in a hundred among the farmers," and "sincerely loves our Party and new country" as such a cadre.

    The conflict between Cui Cheng and Gao Zhenlin runs through the entire play, but the ideological struggle between the two has never been unfolded head-on. There are four times in the play that the conflict between Gao and Cui is shown, but each time it is deliberately avoided by the author as soon as they make contact. This major struggle, which expresses the theme of the play, is what the audience cares about and hopes to see its appearance on the stage, but the author did not give a clear explanation of this issue that the audience urgently needs to understand. Because of the lack of understanding of Cui Cheng's ideological development and inner activities, it makes people feel that Cui Cheng's transformation in the end is not very natural. Cui Cheng's ideological problems have been discussed in the branch committee, talked about many times with Lao Gao and others, and received specific help from the leadership, but have never been resolved. It is not convincing that Gao Zhenlin's explanation this time (Act IV, Scene 1) can completely change him. Cui Cheng's ideological problems could have been resolved earlier. Why was it delayed until Act IV, Scene 1, when the play was about to end, to resolve it? This is because the author has not described or explained some events in the development of the cooperative. There is a series of problems from the preparation of the establishment of the cooperative to the harvest, which need to be explained one by one, and finally, there will be an opportunity to solve Cui Cheng's ideological problems. The arrangement of the plot of the play is not based on the actions of the main characters, but is arranged according to the stages of the general collectivization movement process, divorced from the main characters. In order to obey the needs of this event development, the character's personality is damaged as a result, and the time for Cui Cheng's awakening has to be extended accordingly. In this long period of time, the author cannot arrange the character's activities, so he has to let him fall ill, so that the character is in a static, passive state, and his transformation can only use an artificial, external method, not the result of the character being educated by facts in action, nor the natural development in the ideological struggle. In this way, Cui Cheng's transformation will of course make people feel far-fetched and weak.

    Should the events be expressed according to the characters' actions? Or should the characters be designed according to the process of the events? We see that the author is somewhat intentionally trying to describe the growth of the characters through the development process of the cooperative, rather than expressing the growth process of the cooperative through concentrated character depiction. In this way, the author and his characters cannot but be constrained by several development stages (spring plowing, summer hoeing, autumn harvest...) that he intends to express in the movement, which damages the depiction of the characters and brings some difficulties to himself: writing the process of facts cannot but solve a series of practical problems in the work. At the same time, there is more than one important event that occurs in the process of the development of facts. If you take care of one thing, you will lose sight of the other, and you will not be able to write everything completely. If you focus on writing about people, you can not only see today's struggle from the characters' actions, but also see the past experience from his body because he has come from yesterday's life; he will go to tomorrow, and today's life will definitely show his plans for the future; in this way, the process of the development of things can be expressed more concentratedly and vividly from the characters.

    Writing about the process of facts requires solving many problems and explaining many policies, and because of the development of the actual situation, the specific policies are not always the same; what was considered a major problem at that time may have been solved now. This will not be able to keep up with reality and catch up with policies. If you focus on writing about people, reflect the spiritual outlook of the times through the depiction of the characters, and dissect the characters' inner activities and ideological essence to the audience, and give people spiritual education, then even if the events described are outdated, the educational effect of this socialist spirit on the people will never be outdated.

    The realistic creative method requires that the characters and events are a completely integrated unity, and the specific actions of the characters in the typical environment produce the plot or events, and these plots or events exist precisely for the purpose of describing the characters. The author once used this creative method to achieve success in Act I, Scene 2 and Act II, Scene 1, and deeply portrayed such moving character images as Sun Shoushan and Gao Zhenlin. But he did not persist later. When the development of the character's personality contradicted the development of the process of facts, the author did not correctly choose the former, but succumbed to the requirements of the development of the process of things. Therefore, the characters in the second half of the play are not as vivid and full as before.

    Although "Spring Breeze Blows to the Nuomin River" still has some shortcomings in its creative method, it is generally a meaningful and good play. Its success lies mainly in its success. In the current drama creation, especially in the plays depicting rural life, the emergence of "Spring Breeze Blows to the Nuomin River" is a gratifying harvest, and it is worth our attention, and learn from its creative experience, so as to improve the level of our drama creation.

    评话剧“春风吹到诺敏河”
    赵寻
    安波著  五幕剧  作家出版社出版
    话剧“春风吹到诺敏河”通过一个农业生产合作社的成长过程，描写了在执行党的发展互助合作运动的方针中两条路线的斗争；以支部书记、合作社正主任高振林为代表，基本上执行了积极领导，稳步前进的正确方针，以合作社副主任崔成为代表，却执行了盲目冒进，强迫命令的错误方针。这里，高振林与崔成的斗争，实质上是对待中农问题上两条路线的斗争。团结中农的问题，并不是农村中的一般问题，而是我们在农村工作中成功与失败的关键之一。剧本不但展示了在互助合作运动中盲目冒进的现象，它更形象地指出了所以造成这种错误的思想根源。这种冒进的思想同保守思想一样，都是主观主义的表现形式。作者从今天农村的现实生活中，把握了一个具有普遍教育意义的主题。
    这个剧本的成就不仅在于作者选取了这样一个有意义的主题，更可喜的是作者刻划了一些具有鲜明形象的人物，三个主要人物——高振林、崔成、孙守山都具有一定程度的典型性。作者比较成功地创造了正面人物的明朗形象，较之其他剧本中所写的正面人物，“春风吹到诺敏河”是前进了一大步，高振林给人留下了较深刻的印象。这个正面人物之所以写得比较好，在于作者形象地描绘了他所具有的社会主义的思想品质。当合作社初建时，群众思想还很混乱，社员勤惰不一，工作制度尚未订立，孙守山的退社引起某些中农的思想动摇，领导人员之间意见不一影响了干部的情绪，在这一系列的困难面前，高振林表现了共产党员对人民事业忠诚负责的精神。当然，在困难中他不是没有情绪上的苦恼和思想斗争的，他也这样想过：“唉，这是何苦来呢！……闹的人家亲戚不是亲戚，朋友不是朋友，连老王都有不干的心啦。”（第九十四页）可是：
        高振林：（坐下来，低头沉思，片刻，用手轻
      敲着桌子，独语）对呀，大家对我有意见，是怨自
    己的能耐小，我对人家有意见，那就怨我的度量不
    大了！……（第九十五页）
    就是这样，高振林用自我批评的精神严格要求自己。但是，他对待同志却是宽厚又有原则的。对崔成生活上的关切几乎是无微不至，甚至比崔成自己还想得周到。但是，在对待中农的原则争论上，却丝毫也不肯妥协。他自己虽然也是农民出身，由于党的长期培养和教育，在思想上已突破了原来阶级的限制，他已经习惯于从群众利益的观点来看问题。有一次他的“大铁青”被打坏了，马的损失对于一般农民不是一个小问题，别人都因此替他难受，而他首先想到的是合作社需要建立责任制。他常常因为忙于村里社里的工作而少管理家务，对妻子感到抱歉。这种因公忘私的优秀品质，正是先进人物具有的特征。
    这种社会主义的思想品质，不是用外表事实的罗列和口头解说的方法，而是通过人物的个性，形象地表现出来的。我们熟悉高振林正如我们在农村中朝夕相处的某些村干部一样，他是具有农民的特点、更具有先进思想的人物。他也有自己的家庭、自己的老婆和孩子，需要处理自己的生活。当我们看到他虽然很忙却宁愿自己多做点活，让孩子高兴地去摸鱼玩，这种父亲的心情多么叫人感到亲切！当我们看到他因为一个接一个工作的困难压下来，自己内心烦躁，对妻子好意的埋怨说了两句重话，而马上又意识到不应该，这种夫妻之间的感情写得多么细致！他有着农民朴实稳重的个性，也具有农民特有的风趣，甚至在尖锐的斗争面前，也不是那样声严厉色、气势逼人的。例如当他到孙家去解决孙守山因退社而引起的家庭冲突时，当他与崔成之间展开激烈的思想斗争时，他所表现的也是平易近人与人为善的态度。他爱说爱笑，因而群众喜欢和他接近。联系群众，依靠党的领导，这就是他克服困难力量的源泉，高振林那一段满怀感情的回忆（第八十四页）是动人的，他牢牢地记住了刘政委牺牲时叮嘱他的话：“老高，要工作咱就不怕困难！你想雪山草地怎么过去的？你咬咬牙、问问党，问问群众，什么困难都好办！”事实证明了这个真理：在今天，如果离开了党和群众，任何英雄人物都是不可能产生的。
    这个正面人物所以写得比较好，还由于作者善于集中地运用矛盾冲突，并在这些矛盾冲突中充分地表现人物的思想、情感、性格。风雨之夜的那场戏，（二幕一场）所以那样精彩动人，给人留下了深刻的印象，就是由于作者正确地采用了这种现实主义的手法，在这里，高振林被推到矛盾冲突的尖端，他成了当时生活——矛盾冲突的主人。在这里，社内外的问题，党内外的问题，家内外的问题，干部之间的问题，群众之间的问题，最后还有自己对自己思想斗争的问题，一个接一个的问题，一层加一层的困难，放在高振林的前面，需要他去解决，于是他在克服重重困难的过程中，经受了考验，表现了使人感动的精神力量，就是这样，人物在尖锐的矛盾与艰苦的斗争中被生动地刻划了出来。但是，很可惜地，这种方法在剧本中未能得到充分的发挥。高振林也在这样的场合出现：当问题已经发生，斗争已经展开，作为一个掌握政策的人，用正确的态度来解决纠纷。二幕一场以后，高振林虽然处理了不少具体问题，但人物性格并没有得到进一步的发展与丰富。
    对高振林这个人物的描写上重要问题还在于他思想上的缺点，虽然他在掌握互助合作的政策上基本是正确的，但对中农问题在分寸的掌握上还嫌不够十分准确，这里隐现着作者一些保守迁就的情绪。这一点具体表现在高振林对孙守山的态度上较多。孙守山因为“社里干活勤快手和懒蛋子分不清，还因为马租子评少了，马草料拿多了。”（第六十七页）要退社，这些问题不仅是孙守山一个人的问题，也是合作社当时即应解决的问题，高振林也说：“这提得可都挺要紧呢”；但在这里我们看不到高振林在争取孙守山不退社的重大努力，相反地，在某种程度上采取了放任的态度，只是答应了他自由退社：“……不要说一年，再看看也行哪！你们什么时候看中了，就什么时候入，”固然高振林的争取也可能因为孙守山早有拉脚、贩卖瓦盆这些个人发财的计划而不成功，但是揭穿了他这些表面的理由不是更可显露他的资本主义自发倾向的实质吗？第二幕中，夏锄时节，时逢大雨，孙守山劳力不足，地铲不完，这时高振林发动大家帮助了他，这不但是合作社对单干户的照顾，也表现了集体劳动的优越性，在这活生生的事实面前，应该是个很好的机会在政治上思想上对个体农民进行一次集体主义的教育，可是我们一直到最后孙守山宣布要入社时，还看不出来他原来的思想有什么显著的变化。高振林的基本态度，宣教委员王永说得比较明确，当有一次两个青年农民把董福、孙守山二人插犋，因各有私心争吵不合的事，编成了快板，唱着玩，王永忙喝止说：
        “你这个顺口溜是谁编的？怎么能这个编法
    呢？上一回种地那节，支书（指高振林）不是批评
    过你们来吗？说咱们国家不管合作社、互助组，还
    是单干户，都是一样待承，一样领导，你们这样胡
    糟践人还行啦，这不合乎政策！”（第一三五页）
    自然，歧视和打击单干户是错误的，必须关心和适当地照顾他们，但由于经济性质的不同，生产条件的不同，对合作社与个体农民事实上不可能“一样待承，一样领导”这是很明白的事。如果不顾发展生产的需要，只求形式上的一致，这倒是不合政策的。资本主义的道路是农民“走惯了走熟了的道路”，在实现对农业的社会主义改造时，我们不能设想和农民没有什么矛盾和斗争，正如崔成所说的：
        “……张部长不单说要团结他们，还说要改造
    他们呢！这么多年你还没有看透吗？你要让他一
    尺，他要你让他一丈；你对他格外照顾，他还觉得
    是应分的呢！……”（第一三七页）
    崔成的粗暴态度是不对的，但他的这些话还不是完全没有道理，我们和中农团结的目的是为了领导他走社会主义的道路，反对他走资本主义的道路，这样的团结，就必定有斗争，这种斗争虽然是有分寸的，然而在原则上是不能让步的。在崔成与孙守山的斗争中，崔成是有错误的，应该批评，高振林严格地批评了他，这是对的。但是，孙守山的资本主义的思想更是错误的，更应该批评的，但却批评得不够，这就显得高振林思想上对个体农民政治上的帮助不够重视，领会党对发展互助合作运动的方针不够全面，因而，也使剧本在主题思想的深刻性上受到影响。
    三个主要人物中写得最好的是孙守山，作者运用丰富的农民语言和生活细节的描写，刻划出一个生动真实的中农形象。从孙守山身上我们具体地体会到中农的两面性：一面是劳动者，他热爱劳动，看不惯于荒地松懈怠工；他爱惜自己的牲口，牲口少吃了点他都感到心疼。另一方面，他是私有者，自私保守，眼光短小，他爱自己的马却打别人的马。他自己自私自利却说饲马员韩四“私心特大”；他看着大家说合作社好，自己也就入了社，但是又怕集体损害了个人的利益，又苦闷动摇，要求退社。这些阶级的共同特征通过孙守山的个性微妙地表现了出来。作者在一幕二场中非常形象地描绘了这个中农的各种心理活动。这一场精彩的戏，表现了作者运用现实主义方法描写人物的高度艺术才能，全场自始至终，甚至每个人物的每一段台词都是生动而有意义的，尤其是孙守山父子的一段对话非常恰当地表现了这个中农的思想与心情。例如：
        孙守山：新农具？连他妈给他们留下的两只手
    还使唤不好呢，还新农具！可是咱们要自己干呢？
    出去多拉一趟脚，就是二十来万。到秋后，三匹半
    马还不得一个变俩？你董大爷说啦，贩卖瓦盆可挺
    挣钱，咱就那么干！……你看早先头哪家过好日子
    的，不是将本滚利，慢慢滚大的？（第五十二页）
    这就是孙守山向往资本主义的思想内容，就是由于这种向往，他要坚决退社，高振林一再来向他征询意见，他闭口不提。当孙有才问他为什么不说时，他教训儿子：“……你年轻，还不懂这个，人情不能顶饭吃呀！我既然诚心不入啦，还给他提意见干啥！”既然自己不在内，管他合作社搞好搞坏，这就是他个人主义的处世哲学。甚至在某些微小的，不被人注意的一两句对话上，作者也没有放松对人物个性的刻划。孙有才心绪烦乱，无意地磕打着柜上的一个小铜盒。孙守山忙走过去夺过铜盒来：“你他妈别磕打，我还留着装菜籽呢！”连一个小铜盒都如此爱惜的人，听到要串换他的好地，他暴怒的心情是可以想见的。作者创造的中农孙守山，整个说来（特别是前半部）不但具有阶级性的特征，而且具有艺术的真实。
    但是，在一幕二场描写得非常生动的孙守山这条思想情感的线索，以后并未得到应有的发展。对孙守山的转变入社，作者没有注意发掘他内心思想情感发展的规律，仅仅给他安排了一个又一个的不幸事件，并和合作社的优越性相对比。这当然是符合生活的真实的。孙守山遭到的“天灾”与“人祸”，（“天灾”是正逢多雨，草苗齐长，人力不够，铲地不及；“人祸”是插犋的对象正碰上尖头董福，贩卖瓦盆又赔了本。）不正是与小农经济的根本弱点相联系着吗？合作社的优越性以及对它的援助，不正是吸引他入社的力量吗？但可惜的是，在这里都成了孤立的生活现象，而没有能够和人物的内心世界有机地联系起来。在一幕二场中那样生动而具体地展示了的孙守山的内心世界在以后一系列的事件中有些什么发展与变化呢？我们看得不太清楚。所以，最后当孙守山一声宣布要求入社时，感到有些突然。中农走向合作化，这不仅是主题和政策的要求，也是生活发展的规律。如果剧本通过人物心理的刻划，写出了这种生活发展的规律，把生活现象与政策、主题相结合着的内部联系揭示出来，而不是用事件加事件的数学法则来促其转变，这样孙守山的转变就有他的必然性。
    三个主要人物中崔成虽然是写得比较差的，但在前三场中这个人物还是思想明确，性格可爱的，给人留下过深刻的印象。开始时急于要办社，还没有等大家充分讨论，就以为群众没有意见了，不等上级批准早把马棚盖好，立刻要拉马入社，表现了他主观急躁的心情。但是首先就碰到了他亲戚孙守山的钉子，孙的拉马退社，引起了崔成的愤怒，“上火上得脖子都肿了”，但是，他见着孙守山的儿子有才时反来安慰有才：
        ……这几天我也挺窝火呢！咳！没有法子！为
    了革命工作，为了群众，就得克服点啦！有才，我
    看你也别懊躁了，懊躁出病来可犯不上。（第五十九
      页）
    这里不但表现崔成对革命的忠诚，也表现了对同志的关怀，再如：
        ………这就是节骨眼！不管家庭怎样扯腿，该
    干还是得干哪………你爹就是倔性点，可是该斗争
    还得斗争！当然啦，方式不可不讲究，可是也不能
    怕。年轻人怕什么呢？你要前怕狼后怕虎的，就啥
    事也成不了。（第六十页）
    这些富有性格意味的对话，表现了思想情感的多方面，当人们理解了崔成，感到了他的真实可爱时，才会对于纠正他的思想错误理解得更深切。
    但是，崔成的性格到后来就渐渐走样了，二幕以后，他仅仅是简单地作为一个“反对派”出现的，只要高振林提出的意见，不管有理无理，他都反对，比如实行小包工责任制，本可以督促大家自动地多干活，这样的作法显然合乎崔成个性的要求，但他也坚决反对。又如对单干户的态度问题，按照崔成的爽直个性和对上级的信任，区上回来后他自己也说问题解决了，按理在第三幕中高振林号召帮助孙守山时，不会引起他那样强烈的反对，可是他不但态度不好，接着又要派孙家出民工，看来，是有意找蹩扭，甚至有点报复情绪。这样的描写，连同他另外一些大大咧咧，咋咋唬唬，意气用事，个人主义的态度作风，使人感到崔成的错误，不仅是
  一般性的思想问题，甚至品质上也有问题。这就与原来剧本中所介绍的：“扛长活出身”“在庄稼人堆里不是千里挑一，也是百里挑一”“真心爱咱们的党和新国家”这样的干部就不大相合。
    崔成和高振林的冲突贯穿了全剧，但两人在思想上的斗争却一次也没有正面展开，剧中表现高、崔冲突共有四次，每次都是刚一接触就被作者有意地避开去了。这种表现剧本主题思想的重大斗争，是观众所关心的，希望能从舞台上看到它的出现，但作者对这个观众所迫切需要了解的问题没有予以清楚的交代。因为对崔成思想发展和内心活动的不够了解，就使人感到最后崔成的转变不太自然。崔成的思想问题，曾经过支委会上的讨论，经过老高等的多次谈话，经过领导上的具体帮助，一直未能得到解决，而高振林这次的一番解说（四幕一场）就能彻底转变了，是不能令人信服的。崔成的思想问题本来早可解决，为什么要延迟到四幕一场，戏快结束时才来解决呢？这是因为在写合作社的发展过程中，作者还有一些事件没有描写或交代，从酝酿建社到丰收，有一系列的问题，需要一一加以说明，最后，才能有机会来解决崔成的思想问题。剧本情节的安排不是根据主要人物的行动来表现的，而是脱离了主要人物按一般合作化运动过程的阶段来安排的。为了服从这种事件发展的需要，结果损害了人物的性格，崔成的觉悟时间也不得不因而延长，在这一漫长的时间中，作者无法安排人物的活动，只好让他病倒，使人物在一个静止的、被动的状态下，他的转变也只有用一种人工的、外加的办法，不是人物在行动中，受到事实的教育，也不是在思想斗争中自然发展的结果。这样，崔成的转变当然会使人感到牵强无力了。
    应该是按照人物的行动来表现事件呢？还是依从事件的过程来设计人物？我们看到作者多少是有意要通过合作社的发展过程来描写人物的成长，而不是通过集中的人物描写来表现合作社的成长过程，这样，就不能不使作者及其人物受到他预定要表现运动中的几个发展阶段（春耕，夏锄，秋收……）的约束，以致损害了人物的描写，并给自己带来一些困难：写事实的过程就不能不在作品中解决一系列的实际问题。同时，事实的发展过程中发生的重要事件，不止一桩，顾此失彼，挂一漏万，反倒不能写得完全，如果是着重地写人，不但可以从人物的行动中看到今天的斗争，而且，他是从昨天生活过来，也可以从他身上看到过去的经历；他将往明天走去，在今天的生活中必定表现了他对将来的打算；这样，从人物身上倒可以更集中而形象地表现了事物发展的过程。
    写事实的过程，要解决的问题多，要说明的政策也繁，而且由于实际情况的发展，具体的政策也并非一成不变的；当时所认为重大的问题，现在也许已经解决了。这就会赶不上现实，追不上政策。如果着重写人，通过人物的描写反映时代的精神面貌，把人物的内心活动，思想本质剖视给观众，给人以精神上的教育，这样，纵或描写的那些事件已经过时，但这种社会主义的精神给人民的教育作用是永远不会过时的。
    现实主义的创作方法要求人物和事件是完全溶合无间的统一体，人物在典型环境中的具体行动就产生情节或事件，这些情节或事件正是为了描写人物而存在的。作者曾经运用这种创作方法在一幕二场与二幕一场中取得了成功，深刻地刻划了孙守山与高振林那样动人的人物形象。但到后来没有坚持下去，当人物性格的发展与事实过程的发展发生矛盾时，作者没有正确地选择前者，而屈从了事物过程发展的要求，因而剧本后半部中的人物，就不及以前那样生动饱满。
    “春风吹到诺敏河”在创作方法上虽然还存在着一些缺点，但总的说来仍是一个有意义的好剧本，它的成功之处是主要的。在目前话剧创作，尤其是描写农村生活的剧本中，“春风吹到诺敏河”的产生是个可喜的收获，值得我们加以重视，并从它的创作经验中，吸取有益的东西，来提高我们戏剧创作的水平。
