More than 7,000 college students in Southwest China who are supposed to participate in production internships this year have already begun their internships. Among them, more than 4,000 are engineering students. At Chongqing University, students participating in internships account for about three-quarters of the total student body.

This year, students from various universities in Southwest China participating in production internships are distributed in Southwest, Northwest, Central South and other places. More than 190 students from Chongqing University majoring in geology and mining have participated in geological surveys and detailed surveys in Southwest, Northwest and other places. Sichuan University and Chongqing Institute of Architectural Engineering have also sent students to the Baoji-Chengdu Railway and the Chengdu-Aba Highway for internships.

In order to better assist students in their internship work, the universities have sent teaching staff to guide the internship together with the students to the internship sites. Chongqing University has sent more than 110 teachers to guide the internship. After arriving at factories, mines, farms and other internship units, they quickly formed a unified internship guidance organization with the relevant units, and systematically led the students to carry out internship work. During the internship, students can generally humbly learn the practical experience of technicians and workers, and verify, consolidate and enrich their knowledge. Some students have also had their first creations during the internship. Students from Chongqing University conducting production internships in the metalworking workshop of the Chongqing Air Compressor Factory humbly learned the practical experience of factory workers, and based on their knowledge of machinery, heat treatment, etc., put forward rationalization proposals, simplified the planing machine process, and improved equipment utilization. Students from Sichuan University interning in Jianyang used only a small plane table to carry out surveying work. They completed the measurement of more than 500 mu of cultivated land in six days and ensured the quality of the work. Students from this university interning at a state-owned farm used their knowledge of nutrition and other aspects to improve feed while ensuring the health of livestock, which can save the country a lot of funds every year. Some intern students also helped the internship unit to check the process regulations, so that the operation not only meets the theoretical requirements, but also adapts to the performance of the equipment.

Students have deepened their love for their majors from work practice. Students in the third grade of the highway and urban road major of Chongqing Institute of Architectural Engineering realized the close relationship between highway construction and national construction and people's lives during their internship. They said that they will study the regular courses more comprehensively in the future, and devote themselves to the construction of highways and urban roads after graduation. (Xinhua News Agency)

    西南七千多名高等学校学生开始生产实习
    西南高等学校今年应该参加生产实习的七千多名学生都已经开始生产实习。其中工科学生有四千多名。重庆大学参加实习的学生约占全校学生总数的四分之三。
    今年西南各高等学校参加生产实习的学生分布在西南、西北、中南等地。重庆大学学习地质采矿的一百九十多名学生，已参加西南、西北等地的地质普查、详查等工作。四川大学、重庆建筑工程学院还派有学生到宝成铁路和成阿公路去实习。
    为了更好地帮助学生们进行实习工作，各院校都派有指导实习的教学人员随同学生前往实习场所。重庆大学随去指导实习的教师有一百一十多人。他们到达厂矿、农场等实习单位后，很快就和有关单位组成了统一指导实习的机构，有计划地领导学生展开实习工作。在实习中，学生们一般都能虚心学习技术人员和工人的实际经验，印证、巩固和丰富自己的知识。有些学生还在实习中有了初次的创造。重庆大学在重庆空气压缩机厂金工车间进行生产实习的学生，虚心学习工厂职工的实际经验，并根据所学的机械、热处理等方面知识，提出合理化建议，简化了刨床的工序，提高了设备利用率。四川大学在简阳实习的学生，利用仅有的仪器小平板作测量工作。他们以六天的时间完成了五百多亩耕地的测量，并保证了工作质量。这个大学在某国营农场实习的学生运用营养等方面的知识，在保证牲畜健康的条件下，改进了饲料，使这个农场每年可为国家节约不少资金。实习学生们有的还帮助实习单位校核了工艺规程，使操作既符合理论要求，又适应设备的性能。
    学生们从工作实践中更加深了对自己所学专业的热爱。重庆建筑工程学院汽车干路与城市道路专业三年级的学生们，在实习中认识到公路修建与国家建设和人民生活的密切关系。他们表示今后更要全面学好正课，毕业后献身于汽车干路和城市道路等方面的建设工作。（新华社）
