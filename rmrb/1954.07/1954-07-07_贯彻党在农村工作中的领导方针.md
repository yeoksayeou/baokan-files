    Implementing the Party's Guiding Principles for Rural Work

    As China's socialist construction unfolds in an all-round way, rural work is becoming increasingly heavy, and the leading organs in many areas have felt the pressure of being unable to cope. To avoid falling into a passive position, some comrades have suggested: either increase personnel or reduce tasks. We believe that this view is of no practical help, because the increasing workload is an irreversible trend, and increasing personnel is not necessarily the only condition for doing a good job. The most practical approach is to re-examine and improve our leadership principles in accordance with the needs of the new tasks of the socialist revolution. First, we must clarify the focus of work and fully implement it to create conditions for the smooth resolution of the overall work tasks; at the same time, we must be good at arranging all rural construction work around the central task to achieve overall initiative.

    The Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong have repeatedly instructed in the past two years that the Party committees at all levels in charge of rural work must shift their focus to mutual aid and cooperation; the basic task of current rural work is to carry out an agricultural production movement centered on mutual aid and cooperation. These instructions have received the support of the whole Party and have begun to be implemented in practical work. However, the transformation of a historical task is not so easy, and it is inevitable that some ideological and organizational obstacles will be encountered to varying degrees and from different angles. For example, a few areas and a few comrades, although expressing support for the instructions of the Central Committee, in actual work treated the development of production and the development of mutual aid and cooperation as two separate tasks, only generally emphasizing the development of production, but not emphasizing relying on mutual aid and cooperation to develop production, objectively forming only reliance on the existing individual economic foundation to develop production. The role of the individual economy in the present is absolutely not to be ignored, but the practical experience of the past two years profoundly reminds us that it is impossible to rely on the small peasant economy to develop agricultural production and build socialism. Because the small peasant economy cannot produce a large amount of commodity grain and industrial raw materials according to the needs of planned construction to solve the contradiction of supply falling short of demand in the market. The result of relying on the small peasant economy can only be to sit idly by as the contradiction of this imbalance between supply and demand expands, destroying the balance of the economic construction plan and causing the development of capitalist forces, bringing new disasters and pain to the people. The Party Central Committee instructed us that the enthusiasm of farmers to develop the individual economy must be taken care of, and should not be crudely frustrated. This does not mean that we should retain and rely on the individual economy for a long time, but in order to maintain the close unity between the Party and the peasants, so as to transform the individual economy according to socialist principles. Recognizing this point, it can be made clear that it is completely wrong to treat the development of production and the development of mutual aid and cooperation as two different and opposing tasks; the two must be completely unified, and relying on mutual aid and cooperation to develop agricultural production is the only way to promote the real upsurge of the agricultural economy and ensure the victory of socialist construction in the countryside.

    Some comrades do not oppose in principle putting the development of mutual aid and cooperation as the central task in the countryside, but in actual implementation, they attach certain conditions, such as treating it as the center only in places where the proportion of mutual aid and cooperation is large, and not treating it as the center in places where the proportion is small. They neglect that: First, mutual aid and cooperation organizations throughout the country, including the form of mutual aid groups, have exceeded half of all farmers; among them, the form of cooperatives, although small in number today, will soon develop into the main economic form in agricultural production in the near future, and according to the increase in production of each group and each cooperative in the total social production, it far exceeds the individual economy. Second, even if the proportion of farmers occupied by mutual aid and cooperation organizations in some areas is still very small, it has socialist elements, it is a new and developing system. As soon as this new system appears, it will actively struggle with the old system. The broad masses of peasants are not indifferent to the struggle between the new and old systems, that is, the struggle between the two trends of socialism and capitalism. In fact, everyone is considering, experiencing, seeing the general trend, comparing advantages and disadvantages, and preparing to make the final choice. The small farmers standing at the crossroads, with mutual aid and cooperation organizations giving them a new way out, will greatly reduce their wavering thoughts and gradually improve their enthusiasm for production. On the contrary, if they do not point out a new way out and just shout slogans to encourage farmers' enthusiasm for production, the wavering state of mind of the farmers may be further aggravated. "It's boring to work alone, the road of rich peasants is impassable, so I can only get enough to eat and wear." From this idea expressed by some farmers themselves, we can see the reason.

    Some comrades have a recognition of the importance of mutual aid and cooperation, but the recognition is incomplete. In many places, the phenomenon of "some people mention the central work, but no one does the central work" has been discovered. Some comrades say, "Central work and general work contradict each other," which reflects the one-sidedness of the understanding of some comrades. They only see the role of mutual aid and cooperation in production, and ignore the great role it plays in organizing and educating farmers. Lenin pointed out that the main task of the socialist revolution is: "To complete this extremely complex and precise new organizational system that plans the production and distribution of necessities involving hundreds of millions of people. This revolution can only be successfully realized if the majority of the people, especially the majority of the working masses, demonstrate the independent creative spirit of historical significance. The victory of the socialist revolution can only be guaranteed if the proletariat and the poor peasants show full consciousness, rationality, sacrifice, and firmness." What organizational forms and organizational activities will we rely on to realize the task Lenin suggested among the hundreds of millions of farmers who are accustomed to a scattered state? In the countryside, we have widely established Party organizations, people's democratic power, and various mass organizations. Undoubtedly, it is extremely important and cannot be ignored to continue to build these organizations well and strengthen the Party's influence among the masses through these organizations. However, because the new task before us is to further organize the economic life of all rural residents, that is, to establish a planned production and distribution organizational system as Lenin said, it is not enough to rely solely on the above-mentioned organizations, and we must further rely on and carry out Party activities through a new organizational form. This new organizational form is various cooperatives, especially agricultural production cooperatives. Because agricultural production cooperatives can unite hundreds of millions of small economic units across the country into millions or even hundreds of thousands of large-scale economic units, and can change the internal relations of farmers from the past state of isolation, blind competition, and mutual exclusion to a socialist combination of common development, common prosperity, and friendship and mutual assistance. The more this relationship develops, the more closely the personal interests and collective interests of farmers are integrated, and their original personal selfish psychology will gradually disappear; the new collectivist ideology will also increase day by day. Therefore, this will also facilitate the working class to unite them and lead them; facilitate the state to completely incorporate the economic life of the countryside into the planned track, and finally build a socialist society. From this, it can be seen that mutual aid and cooperation will not contradict the Party's various tasks in the countryside. On the contrary, it provides a broad new foundation and new conditions for these tasks, because "the cooperative system is the greatest tool of the proletarian dictatorship to transform the small peasant economy and educate the basic masses of peasants in the spirit of socialism."

    From this, it can be seen that cooperative organizations are the main foundation for the current development of agricultural production, the central link of the entire rural work, and a powerful tool for organizing farmers to educate farmers. Without it, agricultural production will be difficult to develop to a high degree, various tasks will fall into disarray, and the worker-peasant alliance will be difficult to consolidate. The Party Central Committee's instruction that rural work must be centered on mutual aid and cooperation has extremely profound significance, and violating this instruction will make historical mistakes.

    Of course, a production movement centered on mutual aid and cooperation does not mean that other work can be abandoned and the central work can be isolated. The "single fight" approach is wrong. Because socialist construction is originally a process of coordinated development of various aspects of work, it is impossible to imagine that the mutual aid and cooperation movement can develop in isolation without other economic and political work. There are many tasks in the countryside that have never been interrupted. For example, propaganda and education, Party building, political power construction, etc. These tasks were done well in the past, and today should be done better according to new needs. There are also some new tasks brought about by the socialist revolution, such as planned procurement, planned supply, running state markets, supply and marketing cooperation, handicraft cooperation, credit cooperation, bank savings, planned planting of economic crops, new technological measures in agriculture, etc. These tasks are not only needed by the rural masses today, but also by urban industry and the entire construction. Without the development of urban industry, the development of rural agricultural production and the victory of socialist construction are unimaginable. Rural work can only serve the overall construction plan, actively serve industry, do its best to support the city, and realize national industrialization, so that industry can further help agriculture, and the city can further support the countryside. In the past, in the era of the countryside surrounding the city, we were accustomed to deploying work from the current direct needs of the rural masses, which is no longer fully applicable today. Today, we should deploy work according to the needs of national planned construction, according to the objective economic laws of industry driving agriculture and the city leading the countryside, and from the needs of urban-rural mutual assistance, to achieve the coordinated development of urban and rural economy. The above-mentioned socialist measures in economy, technology, commerce, finance, finance and so on, although difficult to implement under the existing rural conditions, are by no means the same as the "five more" phenomena opposed in the past. The "five more" phenomenon refers to bureaucracy engaged in blindly regardless of needs and possible conditions. Bureaucracy must be opposed. However, these tasks are both needed and have possible conditions, which is certainly not bureaucracy. Of course, bureaucracy may occur in the implementation, but this can only be overcome in the process of advancement, and should not be abandoned because of fear of choking, and should not be avoided.

    From this, it can be seen that the Party's leadership of rural work must not only firmly grasp the center of mutual aid and cooperation, but also have a unified arrangement for various tasks to ensure the comprehensive development of socialist construction. Under this requirement, how the local Party committees at all levels, especially the prefectural and county Party committees, specifically arrange work according to the local conditions at that time has become the most practical, most urgent, and quite difficult problem. In order to promote the gradual and proper solution of this problem, we put forward the following opinions for reference in various places:

    1. We must break through ideas and unify the center. This is the prerequisite for improving leadership. Because the center is unclear, it is the main problem that exists now and will appear in the future. We must not let go of any opportunity to educate all comrades, so that they thoroughly understand the general principles and tasks of socialist construction in the countryside, and understand that basic task of rural work is the agricultural (including agriculture, forestry, fishery, and animal husbandry ) increase production movement centered on mutual aid and cooperation. All rural work must serve the needs of mutual aid and cooperation and rely on the position of mutual aid and cooperation to carry out. All staff must obey unified leadership and overcome decentralism and egalitarianism.

    2. We must improve the organizational leadership system and establish a normal development work order. The Party Committee should, through the collective leadership system, on the one hand, concentrate all work clues in its own hands to ensure the unity of principles and policies. On the other hand, divide the leadership front according to different businesses (such as Party and mass work, financial and trade, culture and education, politics and law, agriculture, urban industry and handicrafts, etc.), implement division of labor management, and overcome the phenomenon of grasping all work at once and no one being responsible, so as to ensure that the work can be carried out comprehensively and regularly. In this way, the Party Committee can free up more strength to grasp the central task, converge the achievements of all aspects of work, and promote its development.

    3. We must deploy work based on the actual local situation. The country is unified, construction is carried out according to plan, and the central tasks and other necessary work stipulated by the central government must be resolutely implemented in various places, and cannot be done their own way. However, when performing these tasks, we must proceed from the viewpoint of raising the revolutionary enthusiasm and construction enthusiasm of the masses. Therefore, first, we must prepare to measure the level of the masses at that time and place, stipulate the progress and requirements for the work, and strictly prevent the adventurist tendency and tailism of being divorced from the masses; second, for the local tasks that the local masses urgently need, as long as they are conducive to the Party contacting the masses and improving the socialist consciousness of the masses, even if the higher authorities have not instructed, they should be actively solved according to local conditions to strengthen the Party's mass base.

    That is to say, we must grasp the center and maintain the corresponding development of various tasks; we must be responsible to the higher authorities and to the local masses; we must obey the overall needs and proceed from the actual situation. Any one-sided simplistic view is wrong. This is the art of leadership. It is difficult and not easy for the Party's leading organs to do this well, but it can be done well. All leading organs must do this well to be considered a good leading organ.

### 贯彻党在农村工作中的领导方针

    贯彻党在农村工作中的领导方针
    随着我国社会主义建设的全面开展，农村工作一天天繁重起来，不少地区的领导机关已感到有应付不过来的困难了。为了避免陷于被动，某些同志曾提出：要不就增加人员，要不就减少任务。我们认为这种意见是无补于实际的，因为工作日益繁重乃是不可改变的趋势，而增加人员并不一定是做好工作的唯一条件。最实际的办法只能是：根据社会主义革命新任务的需要，重新审查和改进自己的领导方针，首先要明确工作中心，全力贯彻中心，为顺利解决全盘工作任务创造条件；同时又要善于围绕中心任务，妥善安排农村全部建设工作，以取得全面主动。
    党中央和毛泽东同志在最近两年曾一再指示：各级管理农村工作的党委，必须将工作重点转移到互助合作方面来；当前农村工作的基本任务，就是开展以互助合作为中心的农业生产运动。这些指示，得到了全党的支持，开始在实际工作中贯彻下去了。但一个历史任务的转变，并不是那样容易的，总不免在不同程度和不同角度上遇到一些思想障碍和组织障碍。例如曾有少数地区少数同志虽然表示拥护中央的指示，但在实际工作中却将发展生产和发展互助合作当作相互分离的两种任务来对待，只一般地强调发展生产，而不强调依靠互助合作去发展生产，客观上形成了只是依靠现有个体经济基础去发展生产。个体经济在眼前的作用是绝不可忽视的，但最近二年来的实践经验深切地提示我们：依靠小农经济基础来发展农业生产，和建设社会主义，是不可能的。因为小农经济不能按照计划建设的需要，生产大量的商品粮食和工业原料，以解决市场上供不应求的矛盾。依靠小农经济的结果，只能坐视这种供求不平衡的矛盾日益扩大，破坏了经济建设计划的平衡，并引起资本主义势力的发展，给人民带来新的灾祸与痛苦。党中央指示我们对于农民发展个体经济的积极性必须加以照顾，而不应粗暴地加以挫折，这并不是说要长期保留和依靠个体经济，而是为了保持党和农民的紧密团结，以便于按社会主义原则来改造个体经济。认识到这一点，就可以明了：把发展生产和发展互助合作，当作两种不同的任务而对立起来，是完全错误的；必须将二者完全统一起来，依靠互助合作去发展农业生产，这才是促进农业经济真正高涨起来并保障社会主义建设在农村中取得胜利的唯一道路。
    有些同志在原则上并不反对在农村中把发展互助合作列为中心任务，但在实际执行时却附加一定条件，例如在互助合作比重大的地方才当做中心，而在比重小的地方则不当作中心。他们忽视了：第一、全国各地互助合作组织连互助组的形式在内，已超过全部农户的半数；其中合作社这一形式，今天为数虽小，但在不远的将来，即将发展成为农业生产中的主要经济形式，而按照每一个组每一个社在社会生产总和中的增产比重来看，更远远超过个体经济。第二、即令互助合作组织在某些地区所占农户比重还是很小的，但因为它具有社会主义因素，是一种新生的、发展着的制度。这种新制度一出现，就要和旧制度积极地进行斗争。而广大的农民群众对于这种新旧制度之间的斗争，也就是社会主义和资本主义两种趋势之间的斗争，并不是漠不关心的，实际上人人都在考虑着、体验着、看大势、比利害、准备做最后的选择。站在十字路口的小农，有了互助合作组织，给他们指出新道路，动摇不定的思想就会大大减少，生产积极性就会逐步提高。反之，如果不指出新道路，空喊鼓励农民生产积极性，农民心理上的动摇状态还可能越发加重，“单干吧没劲，富农的路走不通，只好弄个够吃够穿算了”，从某些农民自己所表白出来的这种想法，就可看出其中的道理所在。
    有些同志对于互助合作的重要性，是有认识的，但认识是不完整的。不少地方发现了“有人提中心工作，无人做中心工作”的现象，有些同志说
  “中心工作和一般工作相矛盾”，这正反映了一部分同志认识上的片面性。他们只看到互助合作表现于生产方面的作用，而忽视了它在组织和教育农民方面所表现的伟大作用。列宁指出过，社会主义革命的主要任务就是：“要把包括千百万人生产的必需品有计划地生产和分配的这一极复杂而精密的新组织系统办理就绪。这种革命只有在人民的大多数，首先是劳动群众的大多数，表现出历史意义的独立创造精神之下，才能顺利实现。只有无产阶级和贫苦农民，能够表现充分自觉性、理智性、牺牲精神和坚定精神的情形之下，社会主义革命的胜利然后才有保障”。我们在习惯于分散状态的亿万个农民中实现列宁所提示的这一任务，将依靠什么样的组织形式和组织活动呢？在乡村中，我们已经广泛地建立了党的组织、有了人民民主政权、有了各种群众团体，无疑的继续建设好这些组织，通过这些组织加强党在群众中的影响，自然是极其重要而不能忽视的。但由于摆在我们面前的新任务，是要进一步组织全体乡村居民的经济生活，也就是列宁所说的建立有计划的生产和分配的组织系统，因此，只依靠上述各种组织就显得不够了，不能不更进一步依靠和通过一种新的组织形式去展开党的活动。这种新的组织形式，就是各种合作社，特别是农业生产合作社。因为农业生产合作社可以将全国亿万户以上的细小经济单位，联合成为几百万以至百把万个大规模经济单位，可以使农民内部关系从过去各自孤立、盲目竞争、相互排挤的关系，变为共同发展、大家富裕、友谊互助的社会主义结合关系。这种关系愈向前发展，农民个人利益和集体利益就愈加密切地融合起来，他们原有的个人自私心理，也就会日渐消退；新的集体主义思想，也就会日益提高。因而，这也就愈便利于工人阶级去团结他们，领导他们；便利于国家将乡村的经济生活完全纳入计划轨道，最后建成社会主义社会。从这里可以看出互助合作不但不会和党在乡村的各种工作发生矛盾，相反地，它正好给这些工作提供了广阔发展的新基础和新条件，因为“合作制是无产阶级专政拿来改造小农经济和以社会主义精神教化农民基本群众的最伟大的工具”。
    由此可知，合作组织是当前农业生产发展的主要基础，是整个农村工作的中心环节，又是组织农民教育农民的有力工具。离开它，农业生产难以高度发展，各种工作会陷于涣散，工农联盟也难于巩固。党中央指示农村工作必须以互助合作为中心，是具有极其深厚的意义的，违背这一指示是会犯历史性错误的。
    当然，以互助合作为中心的生产运动，绝不是说可以放弃其他工作，将中心工作孤立起来。“单打一”的做法是错误的。因为社会主义建设，本来就是多方面工作配合发展的过程，不能设想离开其他经济工作和政治工作，互助合作运动可以孤立地发展起来。农村中有许多工作，从来就不曾间断过。例如宣传教育、党的建设、政权建设等，这些工作过去做得很好，今天应根据新的需要争取做得更好。另有一些是社会主义革命带来的新的工作，如计划收购、计划供应、举办国家市场、供销合作、手工业合作、信用合作、银行储蓄、经济作物的计划种植、农业中新技术措施等。这些工作，在今天不仅为农村群众所需要，而且为城市工业和整个建设所需要。没有城市工业的发展，乡村农业生产的发展和社会主义建设的胜利是不能想像的。农村工作只有服从总的建设计划，积极服务于工业，尽力支援城市，实现国家工业化，才能使工业进一步帮助农业，城市进一步支援乡村。过去在乡村包围城市时代，我们惯于从乡村群众当前的直接需要出发来部署工作，这在今天已经不完全适用了。今天应根据国家计划建设的需要，根据工业带动农业和城市领导乡村的客观经济规律，从城乡互助的需要出发来部署工作，以达到城乡经济的配合发展。上述种种属于经济、技术、商业、金融、财政等等方面的社会主义措施，虽然在现存的农村条件下，执行起来是有困难的，但这绝不同于过去所反对的“五多”现象。“五多”现象是指不顾需要和可能条件盲目从事的官僚主义。官僚主义必须反对。可是上述这些工作既属需要又具备可能条件，这当然不是官僚主义。固然在执行中也可能发生官僚主义，但这只能在前进中去克服，而不可因噎废食，避而不做。
    由此可见，党对乡村工作的领导，既要紧紧掌握互助合作这个中心，又必须对各种工作有统一安排，以保证社会主义建设的全面发展。在这种要求下各级地方党委特别是地委和县委，如何根据当时当地情况具体安排工作，就成为最实际最紧要而又颇感困难的问题了。为促进这一问题逐步妥善解决，我们提出以下几点意见，供各地参考：
    一、必须打通思想，统一中心。这是改进领导的前提。因为中心不明，乃是现存的和以后还会出现的主要问题。必须不放松任何一个机会去教育所有的同志，使他们透彻了解乡村社会主义建设的总方针和总任务，了解农村工作的基本任务就是以互助合作为中心的农业（包括农、林、渔、牧）增产运动。农村一切工作要服务于互助合作的需要并依靠互助合作这个阵地去进行。全体工作人员均须服从统一领导，克服分散主义和平均主义。
    二、必须健全组织领导制度，确立正常发展的工作秩序。党的委员会应通过集体领导制度，一方面将全部工作线索集中在自己手中，以保障方针政策的统一。另一方面，按不同的业务划分领导战线（例如党和群众工作、财经贸易、文教、政法、农业、城市工业和手工业等等），实行分工管理，克服工作一把抓以及无人负责现象，以保障工作能全面而经常地进行。这样，党委便可以腾出更多力量掌握中心任务，汇合各方面工作的成就，来推动它的发展。
    三、必须从当地实际情况出发来布置工作。全国统一，建设按计划进行，中央所规定的中心任务和其他必要的工作，各个地方均须坚决执行，不能各自为政。但在执行这些任务时，必须从提高群众的革命积极性和建设积极性这个观点出发。因此第一，要准备衡量当时当地的群众水平，规定对工作的进度和要求，要严防脱离群众的冒进倾向和尾巴主义；第二，为当地群众所迫切需要的地方任务，只要是有利于党联系群众和提高群众社会主义觉悟的，即使上级没有指示，也应因地制宜主动解决，以加强党的群众基础。
    这就是说，既要掌握中心，又要保持各种工作相适应的发展；既要对上级负责，又须对当地群众负责；既须服从全局需要，又须从实际情况出发。任何偏于一面的简单化观点都是错误的。这就是领导的艺术。党的领导机关要作好这件事是有困难的，是不容易的，但是可以作好的。一切领导机关必须作好这件事，才能算是一个好的领导机关。
