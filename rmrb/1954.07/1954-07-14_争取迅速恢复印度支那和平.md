    In his reply to questions posed by the editor-in-chief of the Vietnam News Agency on July 6, President Ho Chi Minh of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam pointed out the significance of the progress made at the Geneva Conference regarding the restoration of peace in Indochina and reiterated the consistent position of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in sincerely seeking a peaceful resolution to the Indochina issue. This statement has been well received by international public opinion. The Chinese people express their heartfelt support for this.

    In recent days, the foreign ministers of the Soviet Union, France, China, and the United Kingdom have successively returned to Geneva. The Geneva Conference's discussion on the Indochina issue is about to enter an important stage. Peace-loving people around the world are closely watching the future development of the Geneva Conference and will continue to support all efforts towards sincere consultation and the pursuit of agreement.

    As everyone knows, the government and people of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam are peace-loving and have consistently advocated negotiating a ceasefire and restoring peace on the basis of respecting national rights. On November 26, 1953, President Ho Chi Minh once again put forward a peace proposal in his reply to the editor-in-chief of the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" in Stockholm. This proposal was supported by the French people and the peace-loving governments and peoples of various countries. The then French government, under the interference of the United States, rejected the peace proposal. The reason why the Geneva Conference failed to reach an agreement quickly after it began discussing the Indochina issue was also due to the obstruction of the United States and the procrastination of the Laniel-Bidault government. Now, French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Mendès France has repeatedly stated his willingness to seek a swift realization of a ceasefire in Indochina, which President Ho Chi Minh has welcomed, pointing out that "it is only possible to swiftly realize a ceasefire in Indochina by eliminating the policy adopted by the United States of obstructing and sabotaging the Geneva Conference." This is entirely correct.

    The French people and people from all walks of life are urgently demanding an end to the Indochina War and resolutely oppose the tremendous pressure exerted on the French government by the current forces of war. The recent French National Assembly fully demonstrated that the French people's desire for peace is indelible and that policies that violate French interests are unworkable. France is a major world power, and it should have its own independent and glorious path, which is to adopt an independent and autonomous foreign policy that is in line with France's national interests and the interests of world peace.

    The increasingly isolated ruling group in the United States still attempts to continue its reckless actions. Recently, Dulles delivered a series of speeches, openly complaining that its allies did not agree to the U.S.'s adventurous plan to expand the Indochina War last March, and stating that the Geneva Conference would not yield any results and that "other paths" must now be "considered." This so-called "other path" is the path of hostility to peace that the United States has been intensifying after the Washington talks by cobbling together a Southeast Asian aggressive bloc and creating tensions in Asia. The war-hysterical clamoring of American warmongers like Radford and Carney continues.

    The U.S. ruling group appears to be very afraid of possible new developments at the Geneva Conference. It is very bluntly exerting pressure on the new French government. U.S. President Eisenhower openly wrote to French President Coty, stating that "the proposal regarding joint defense (referring to the Southeast Asian aggressive bloc) that we made to Mr. Laniel is a major and serious decision we have made. Nothing has happened here to change the attitude that has been expressed in this way, although the passage of time and the events that have occurred have naturally created a new situation." In the letter, Eisenhower also requested a separate meeting with the new French government after the Washington talks in order to put more direct pressure on France. This is clearly contrary to the policy of rapidly ending the Indochina War as demanded by the French people.

    The policy of the U.S. ruling group to obstruct the restoration of peace in Indochina is unpopular and must be eliminated. The discussion on the Indochina issue at the Geneva Conference has successively achieved two agreements. Upon returning to Geneva, Foreign Minister Molotov issued a statement at the airport, saying: "The work done in the past two weeks by the representatives who remained in Geneva in place of the ministers is of considerable significance for achieving positive results at the Geneva Conference." This fully demonstrates that as long as all parties participating in the conference, especially the parties directly concerned, are sincere and show a spirit of reconciliation, the restoration of peace in Indochina can be achieved through consultation.

    Now, all parties participating in the Geneva Conference should continue to work hard on the existing basis to achieve a ceasefire in Indochina as soon as possible. This is the common hope of peace-loving people in all countries and is also in line with the interests of the directly concerned countries and the cause of world peace. The French people have strongly expressed their desire to stop the Indochina War, the Indochinese people are also working towards achieving this goal, and the governments and peoples of other countries are also willing to see peace in Indochina restored quickly. This universal desire for peace cannot and should not be ignored.

    The realization of peace in Indochina will further ease international tensions and help establish stable and normal relations in Southeast Asia and throughout Asia. In the joint statements recently issued by the prime ministers of China and India and the prime ministers of China and Burma, it was stated that the Five Principles of mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence should serve as the guiding principles for relations between China and India and China and Burma, and should be applicable to all countries in Asia and to general international relations. The joint statement by the prime ministers of China and India also believes that the Five Principles also apply to the resolution of the Indochina issue in order to create free, democratic, unified, and independent states in Indochina. This wish expressed by the prime ministers of China and India and the prime ministers of China and Burma has received the support of other Asian governments. President Ho Chi Minh also stated that the Vietnamese people warmly welcome these two joint statements, believing that the Five Principles also apply to the resolution of the Indochina issue. He said: "I believe that these two joint statements will definitely contribute to peace in Asia and peace in the world." There is no doubt that the restoration of peace in Indochina and the transformation of Indochina into truly free, democratic, unified, and independent countries will certainly enable these countries to establish and develop friendly relations with each other and with other countries in the world. People all over the world should welcome the stability of the Asian situation and the establishment of mutually friendly relations.

    The current task of peace-loving people in all countries is to strive for the success of the Geneva Conference in negotiating the restoration of peace in Indochina. However, it should be noted that the enemies of peace have not abandoned their sabotage conspiracies. As President Ho Chi Minh pointed out in his answer to reporters: "We should maintain a high degree of vigilance against the US imperialists' attempts to obstruct and sabotage the conclusion of a ceasefire agreement between the two sides and their attempts to establish an aggressive military alliance in Asia, divide Asia into opposing blocs, so as to invade and control Indochina and Southeast Asia, and continue to expand the war." Therefore, all forces that desire peace must further unite, work together to thoroughly defeat the sabotage conspiracies of the enemies of peace, and strive for a swift restoration of peace in Indochina.

### 争取迅速恢复印度支那和平

    争取迅速恢复印度支那和平
    越南民主共和国胡志明主席七月六日在对越南通讯社主编所提问题的答复中，指出了日内瓦会议关于恢复印度支那和平问题的进展的意义，重申越南民主共和国真诚谋求印度支那问题和平解决的一贯立场。这个谈话，得到了各国舆论的良好反应。中国人民对此表示衷心支持。
    近几日来，苏联、法国、中国、英国的外长，先后回到日内瓦去。日内瓦会议对印度支那问题的讨论，即将进入重要的阶段。全世界爱好和平的人民都在密切地注视着日内瓦会议今后的发展，并将继续支持一切真诚协商、谋求协议的努力。
    大家知道，越南民主共和国的政府和人民是爱好和平的，一直主张在尊重民族权利的基础上谈判停战，恢复和平。一九五三年十一月二十六日胡志明主席在答复瑞典斯德哥尔摩“快报”主编的谈话中，又一次提出了和平建议。这个建议得到了法国人民和各国爱好和平的政府和人民的支持。当时的法国政府在美国的干涉下拒绝和平建议。日内瓦会议开始讨论印度支那问题后所以未能迅速取得协议，也是由于美国的阻挠和拉尼埃—皮杜尔政府的拖延所致。现在，法国总理兼外长孟戴斯—弗朗斯一再表明愿意谋求印度支那停火的迅速实现，胡志明主席对此表示欢迎，并指出“必须排除美国所采取的阻挠和破坏日内瓦会议的政策，才有可能迅速实现印度支那的停火。”这是十分正确的。
    法国人民和其他各阶层的人士都迫切地要求结束印度支那战争，坚决反对目前战争势力加于法国政府的巨大压力。最近的法国国民议会充分表明了法国人民的和平愿望是不可抹煞的，违反法国利益的政策是行不通的。法国是一个世界大国，它应该有它自己独立的光荣的出路，这就是采取符合于法国国家利益和世界和平利益的独立自主的外交政策。
    日陷孤立的美国统治集团，依然企图继续蛮干下去。最近杜勒斯连续发表演说，公然抱怨今年三月间它的盟国没有同意美国扩大印度支那战争的冒险计划，并表示日内瓦会议不会有什么结果，现在必须“考虑别的道路”。这个所谓“别的道路”，就是华盛顿会谈之后美国加紧进行的拚凑东南亚侵略集团，制造亚洲紧张局面的敌视和平的道路。美国好战分子雷德福、卡涅之流的战争歇斯底里的叫嚣，正在继续着。
    美国统治集团对日内瓦会议可能的新发展，显得非常害怕。它十分露骨地对法国新政府施加压力。美国总统艾森豪威尔曾公开致函法国总统戈蒂，表示“我们向拉尼埃先生提出的关于联合防务（按指东南亚侵略集团）的建议是我们所作的一个重大的和严重的决定。这里并未发生任何事足以改变已这样表示的态度，虽然光阴的消逝和已发生的事件自然已产生了一个新的局势。”艾森豪威尔在信中并要求在华盛顿会谈后与法国新政府举行单独会谈以便更直接对法国加压力。这显然是和法国人民所要求的迅速结束印度支那战争的政策背道而驰的。
    美国统治集团阻挠印度支那恢复和平的政策，是不得人心的，是必须加以排除的。日内瓦会议关于印度支那问题的讨论，已经先后取得两项协议。莫洛托夫外长返抵日内瓦时，在机场发表声明说：
  “在过去两个多星期中，代替部长们留在日内瓦的代表所做的工作，对于达成日内瓦会议的肯定结果具有相当重大的意义。”这就充分说明只要参加会议的各方，特别是直接有关方面抱有诚意，并表现出和解精神，就可以以协商方法恢复印度支那的和平。
    现在，参加日内瓦会议的各方应该在已有的基础上继续努力，以求得早日实现印度支那的停战。这是各国爱好和平人民的共同希望，并且也是符合于直接有关国家和世界和平事业的利益的。法国人民已经强烈地表示了他们要求停止印度支那战争的愿望，印度支那人民也正为着实现这个目标而努力，其他各国的政府和人民也都愿意看到印度支那的和平能够迅速恢复。对于这种普遍的和平愿望是不能而且也没有理由予以漠视的。
    印度支那和平的实现将进一步缓和国际紧张局势，并有助于建立东南亚和整个亚洲的稳定的正常关系。最近中印两国总理和中缅两国总理先后发表的联合声明中，曾表示关于各国互相尊重领土主权，互不侵犯，互不干涉内政，平等互利，和平共处的五项原则，应该作为指导中印两国和中缅两国之间关系的原则，并应当适用于亚洲各国及一般国际关系之中。中印两国总理联合声明还认为印度支那问题的解决也适用这五项原则，以创造自由、民主、统一和独立的印度支那各个国家。中印两国总理和中缅两国总理所表示的这个愿望，得到了亚洲其他国家政府的支持。胡志明主席也表示越南人民热烈地欢迎这两个联合声明，认为这五项原则也适用于印度支那问题的解决，他说：“我相信，这两个联合声明一定有助于亚洲的和平与世界的和平。”毫无疑问，印度支那和平的恢复和印度支那各国成为真正自由、民主、统一与独立的国家，一定能够使这些国家相互之间和它们与世界其他国家之间建立和发展友好的关系。全世界人民都应当欢迎亚洲局势的稳定和相互友好关系的建立。
    各国爱好和平人民的当前任务是争取日内瓦会议对恢复印度支那和平问题谈判的成功。但是，应该注意到和平的敌人还没有放弃他们的破坏阴谋。正如胡志明主席在答记者问中所指出的：“对于美帝国主义企图阻挠和破坏双方停战协议的达成和企图在亚洲建立侵略性的军事联盟，把亚洲分裂为对立集团，以便侵略和控制印度支那和东南亚，继续扩大战争的阴谋，我们应该保持着高度警惕。”因此，一切愿望和平的力量必须进一步团结起来，为彻底击败和平敌人的破坏阴谋、争取迅速恢复印度支那的和平而共同努力。
