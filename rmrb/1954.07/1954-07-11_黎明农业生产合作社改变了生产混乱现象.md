The Liming Agricultural Producers' Cooperative in Gucheng Village, Keshan County, Heilongjiang Province, is a newly established cooperative this spring. The entire cooperative has thirteen male laborers and ten female laborers. After the cooperative was established, everyone didn't know how to organize labor to work. They held meetings every night to arrange work, and the meetings lasted until midnight. Once, they didn't hold a meeting to arrange work the night before, and the work was assigned temporarily the next day, leaving three laborers with nothing to do. The cooperative director told them to go home and rest for a day. In fact, there was a lot of work in the cooperative, but it wasn't arranged properly. When planting spring wheat, two pairs of plows and eleven people were enough, but twelve were sent, wasting labor. The labor remuneration was also unreasonable. Regardless of light or heavy work, high or low skill, they were all evaluated with the same work points. Therefore, the enthusiasm of the cooperative members was not high, and the work was both little and rough. Carts, horses, and farm tools were not managed by anyone. They were grabbed randomly when needed and thrown away randomly after use. Cooperative members took turns feeding the horses, sometimes feeding them full and sometimes letting them starve, with no one responsible. The cooperative members' thinking was also quite chaotic. Some who reluctantly joined the cooperative in the past were now wavering and secretly planning to withdraw from the cooperative. This chaotic phenomenon continued until the end of wheat planting.

After planting wheat, in order to change this chaotic situation, the cooperative council and all cooperative members held a meeting to specifically study the problems existing in the management work in the previous period. They also learned from the experience of the old cooperative in the village in organizing production and formulated specific improvement measures. When sowing the large fields, production gradually became orderly. The original plan was to finish planting the large fields in seventeen days, but it was finished in fourteen days.

The cooperative's methods for improving management are:

I. Make small-stage plans and arrange production well. Everyone found that the main reason for the chaos in production during the preparatory farming and wheat planting period was that production was not arranged well. They did whatever came up, without any clear plan. After learning the old cooperative's method, they first studied the plan for planting large fields and also made small-stage plans for three to five days. In this way, the cooperative director no longer needed to plan every day and assign work temporarily. The cooperative members also knew what to do that day and took the initiative to do it.

II. Organize and use labor reasonably. The entire cooperative has thirteen male laborers and ten female laborers. In addition to assigning one laborer to be specifically responsible for feeding the horses, the rest were formed into three temporary groups based on production needs and technical expertise, with a group leader selected for each group. The task of each small stage was assigned to each group, and the group then divided the work according to each person's expertise using democratic allocation and voluntary combination. For example, when planting, one pair of plows was divided into plowing, sowing, and pulling the roller. The group used democratic allocation and voluntary combination to fix the division of labor, which not only gave play to the cooperative members' expertise but also avoided chaos.

III. Gradually implement small-scale contracting and piece-rate systems. The cooperative first started with easy-to-contract work such as chopping straw to gain experience and gradually tried to contract as much work as possible. On the basis of small-scale contracting, a piece-rate system was also tested for some whole jobs, such as the work of a pair of plows, where the number of points for plowing, sowing, and applying fertilizer were democratically evaluated. When encountering work that was difficult to determine the number of contract work, fair middle-level laborers were selected to try the work first, and then the work was contracted. When implementing the contracting and piece-rate system, quality standards were also stipulated. If the quality was not good enough, the work had to be reworked or points deducted. Each group also established a patrol inspection system to check and supervise each other, which played a certain role in ensuring quality. Due to the implementation of the contracting and piece-rate system, the labor efficiency when planting large fields increased by 25% compared with planting wheat, and more than 95% met the quality standards.

IV. Establish a responsibility system for the use and safekeeping of carts, horses, and farm tools. The cooperative stipulated that carts and horses should be allocated to production groups for long-term use. A dedicated person should be assigned to each group to manage them and call on them flexibly. Large farm tools such as plows and harrows should be used and kept by groups according to the production season. Small farm tools should be used for short periods of time, with the user temporarily responsible for safekeeping. After use, a dedicated person should be responsible for safekeeping them in a unified manner. The method of taking turns feeding the horses was also changed to a dedicated person feeding them year-round. This changed the phenomenon of no one being responsible. In the past, cooperative members threw farm tools around, but now they put them back in their original places in an orderly manner after use. On rainy days, some cooperative members even got up in the middle of the night to cover the carts.

While improving management, the cooperative also continuously carried out political and ideological education for the cooperative members, strengthened their confidence in running the cooperative, and corrected some cooperative members' phenomena of not cherishing public property and being lazy in their work.

After these improvements, the Liming Agricultural Producers' Cooperative brought into play the cooperative members' enthusiasm for labor and overcame the chaos in production, enabling the cooperative to continuously consolidate and improve in production.

    黎明农业生产合作社改变了生产混乱现象
    胡万阁　于喜滨
    黑龙江省克山县古城村黎明农业生产合作社是今年春天新建立的社，全社有十三个男劳动力，十个女劳动力。社建立起来了，开始大家都不知道应该怎样组织劳动力干活，天天晚上开会安排活计，一开就是半夜。有一次头天晚上没开会排活，第二天临时分工，剩下三个劳动力没活干，社主任就叫他们回家休息了一天。实际上社里活很多，就是没安排好。种春麦时，两付犁十一个人足够了，但是派去十二个，窝了工。劳动报酬也不合理，不分轻活重活、技术高低，都评一样工分。因此社员劳动积极性不高，干活又少又粗糙。车马农具无人经管，用时乱抢，用完乱扔。社员轮班喂马，饱一顿，饿一顿，无人负责。社员思想也相当混乱，过去随帮唱戏勉强入社的人，这时思想就动摇了，暗中盘算出社。这种混乱现象一直拖到麦播结束。
    种完小麦，为了改变这种混乱状况，社理事和全体社员开会，专门研究了前一段经营管理工作中存在的问题，又学习了本村老社组织生产的经验，制定了具体改进办法。在播种大田时，生产就逐渐有秩序了。原计划十七天种完大田，十四天就种完了。
    这个社改进经营管理的办法是：
    一、订好小段计划，安排好生产。大家找出在备耕和种麦时期生产混乱的主要原因，是没有安排好生产，碰啥干啥，心中没数。学了老社的办法后，首先就研究了种大田的计划，还订出了三天到五天的小段计划。这样，社主任就不需要天天计划、临时派活了；社员也早知道那天干啥，主动去做。
    二、合理组织和使用劳动力。全社十三个男劳力，十个女劳力，除抽出一个劳力专门负责喂马外，其余的都根据生产需要和技术特长编成三个临时小组，每组选一个组长领导。每小段的任务分配给各组，组内再按各人特长进行分工。如种地时一付犁分扶犁、点种、扶拉子等活，组内用民主分配与自愿结合的办法固定分工，既发挥了社员的特长，又避免了混乱。
    三、逐步推行小包工和按件计工制。这个社先从铡草等好包工的活开始实行小包工，创造经验，逐步做到能包工的活尽量包工。在小包工的基础上，又试行了部分整活的按件计工制，如一付犁杖的活，由民主评定扶犁的多少分、点种的多少分、摅粪的多少分等。遇到难确定包工数的活，就选出公正的中等劳动力先行试工，然后再包。实行包工和计件制时，也规定了质量标准，质量不够的要返工或减分。各小组还建立了巡回检查制度，相互检查监督，对保证质量起了一定作用。由于实行包工和计件制，种大田时劳动效率比种小麦提高百分之二十五，合乎质量标准的达百分之九十五以上。
    四、建立车马农具的使用保管责任制度。这个社规定：车马按生产小组配开，长期使用，组内确定专人保管，灵活调用；犁、耲等大农具按照生产季节分组使用保管；小农具短期使用，由使用的人临时负责保管，用后由专人统一负责保管。轮流喂马的办法也改成专人常年固定喂养。这样就改变了无人负责的现象，过去社员把农具乱扔，现在用后都规规矩矩放在原处，阴雨天有的社员半夜也起来把车套盖上。
    在改善经营管理的同时，这个社又不断对社员进行了政治思想教育，坚定了社员办社的信心，纠正某些社员不爱护公共财产、干活拖拉等现象。
    黎明农业生产合作社经过这样改进，发挥了社员劳动积极性，克服了生产上的混乱现象，使合作社在生产中不断巩固提高。
