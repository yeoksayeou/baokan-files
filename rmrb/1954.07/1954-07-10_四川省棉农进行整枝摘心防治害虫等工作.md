    Sichuan Cotton Farmers Carry Out Pruning, Topping, Pest Control, and Other Work
    In Sichuan Province, the 3.8 million mu of cotton are generally growing well, with the earlier planted cotton already showing flower buds. Currently, in cotton-producing areas such as the Suining, Neijiang, Wanxian, Nanchong, and Daxian special districts, mutual aid and cooperation organizations are actively leading individual farmers to carry out field management work such as pruning, topping, and pest control, striving for a bumper cotton harvest.
    This year, various counties in the cotton-producing areas of Sichuan Province have held cotton planting technology seminars, focusing on studying cotton planting techniques such as pruning and topping. More than 20 key cotton-producing counties, including Renshou, Nanbu, Rongxian, Lezhi, and Jianyang, have also held cotton planting technology seminars at the district and township levels to teach agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid team technicians, and some elderly farmers the "five hitting" techniques of hitting overgrown branches, hitting top buds, hitting axillary buds, hitting lateral buds, and hitting old leaves, and organized them to conduct field practice. Five agricultural production cooperatives and more than 260 perennial mutual aid teams in the second district of Rongxian County have all guaranteed to lead individual farmers in implementing the "five hitting" techniques. The Xingfu Agricultural Production Cooperative in Suining County invited representatives from nearby mutual aid teams and individual farmers to visit the cooperative's cotton fields, where the cooperative's technicians explained the experience of increased cotton production last year and taught advanced cotton planting techniques in the field.

    四川省棉农进行整枝摘心防治害虫等工作
    四川省三百八十多万亩棉花一般生长良好，播种较早的已现花蕾。目前产棉区遂宁、内江、万县、南充、达县等专区各县，互助合作组织正积极带动单干农民，进行整枝摘心、防治虫害等田间管理工作，争取棉花丰收。
    今年四川省产棉区各县曾先后举行植棉技术座谈会，着重研究了整枝摘心等植棉技术。仁寿、南部、荣县、乐至、简阳等二十多个重点产棉县，还分别召开区、乡的植棉技术座谈会，向农业生产合作社、互助组的技术员和部分老年农民传授打徒长枝、打顶心、打芽子、打旁心、打老叶的“五打”技术，并组织他们进行田间实习。荣县第二区五个农业生产合作社和二百六十多个常年互助组，都保证带动单干农民贯彻“五打”技术。遂宁县幸福农业生产合作社邀请附近的互助组代表和单干农民参观社里的棉田，由社里的技术员讲述去年棉花增产的经验，并在田间实地传授先进的植棉技术。
