Farmers around Dongting Lake in Hunan Province are working day and night to fight the floods, actively rescuing and preventing dangers. In the lake bay of Gangwenli, ships and wooden boats shuttle back and forth, transporting large quantities of sacks, wood, reeds, and galvanized wire, providing flood control materials to support farmers in various embankments to carry out emergency rescue and prevent waves. Party and government leading cadres at all levels in the areas along the river and lake in Hunan Province have gone to the dikes to lead farmers in emergency rescue. Many people have shown bravery and resourcefulness in flood prevention and rescue. On the evening of June 27, hundreds of cadres and farmers guarding the dike of Zhufeng Embankment in Changde County saw that the raging waves were about to overflow the dike. Each person held a bundle of reeds and threw themselves on the dike, using their bodies to block the huge waves and protect the dike until dawn. Afterwards, they carried new soil to heighten the dike. Li Debao, a Communist Party member and township cadre in Daluxiang, Nanxian County, had not slept for four or five days. One stormy night, while he and the militia instructor were inspecting the dike, they discovered a breach in the dike. Water was gushing into the fields. Li Debao used his body to block the breach. The militia instructor rushed back to the village to mobilize nearby farmers to help. Immediately, some carried soil and others drove piles, and the breach was blocked. At noon on June 2, the Heping Sluice of the Hua'an Great Embankment in Yuanjiang County leaked, and water rushed straight into the fields. Liu Jinnan, the militia company commander, ran home in one breath and brought two cotton quilts, jumped into the water to plug the leak. More than twenty young farmers, including Yi Baohua, also jumped into the water, filling the leak with a total of five cotton quilts and four sacks filled with soil. The leakage lessened, and then more than three hundred people carried soil and filled the leak, protecting more than 50,000 mu of rice seedlings and the safety of more than 20,000 people in the entire embankment. When the Li Family Enclosure in Baohe Township, Huarong County, breached, Wang Jinming, a member of the Communist Youth League, carried a door plank on his back, jumped into the water, and used both himself and the plank to block the breach. Then, more than thirty farmers worked together to seal the breach. (Xinhua News Agency)

Farmers in the Dujiangyan Basin in Sichuan Province have overcome this year's first flood, protecting the good growth of more than three million mu of rice.

This year, the first flood on the upper reaches of the Minjiang River reached Dujiangyan on June 16. The water was very strong, and the flood peak in the outer river was higher than the danger level. The inner river was only two municipal inches away from the danger level, and the duration was longer than in previous years. During the flood, local party and government officials led farmers to the important embankments day and night to fight the flood. Several key projects along the Jinma River in the outer river were destroyed by the flood, and 200 mu of farmland were flooded. After nearly 10,000 laborers repaired them, most of the farmland was saved. During the rescue, farmers in various counties in the Dujiangyan Basin supported each other. Peng County and Chongning County alone sent more than 200 workers to weave bamboo cages to protect the banks. Farmers in Pixian, Chongning, Chongqing, Shuangliu and other counties transported about 400,000 jin of bamboo materials to the rescue sites in Guanxian and Wenjiang counties in three days. At present, the flood control agencies of 15 counties and cities in the Dujiangyan Basin are actively leading farmers to do various preparatory work to defend against the re-invasion of floods.

    洞庭湖滨农民积极防汛抢险
    都江堰流域农民战胜今年首次洪水
    湖南省洞庭湖滨广大农民正夜以继日地和洪水展开搏斗，积极抢救阻险。湖湾港汶里，轮船、木船往来如梭地运送着大批麻袋、木材、芦柴和铅丝等防汛器材，支援各堤垸农民抢险防浪。湖南省沿江滨湖地区各级党、政领导干部都已上堤领导农民抢险。许多人在防汛抢险中英勇机智。六月二十七日晚上，守卫在常德县祝丰垸大堤上的数百名干部和农民，见到汹涌的浪涛快要翻过堤身时，每人抱着一捆芦柴倒在大堤上，用自己的身体挡住巨浪，掩护着堤身，一直坚持到天明后，他们挑着新土，加高了堤防。南县大路乡共产党员、乡干部李得保已经四、五天没有睡觉，在一个风雨的深夜他和民兵指导员一道检查堤防时，发现堤上有一个溃口，水哗呐哗呐地直往垸田里灌，李得保以自己的身体堵住溃口，民兵指导员赶回村庄动员附近农民来抢救，立刻大家挑土的挑土，打桩的打桩，把溃口抢阻住。六月二日中午，沅江县华安大垸的和平闸浸漏，水直往垸田里冲。民兵中队长刘金南一口气跑到家里拿来两床棉絮被，跳下水去堵塞漏洞，青年农民易保华等二十多个人也跟着下水，一共塞了五床棉被和四个装着泥土的麻袋；浸漏小了，接着三百多人挑着泥土填好了漏洞，保住了全垸五万多亩禾苗和两万多人的安全。华容县保合乡的李家围子溃了口，青年团员王锦明背着一块门板，跳下水去，连人带板把溃口堵住；接着三十多个农民一齐动手，把溃口堵塞。（新华社）
    四川省都江堰流域的农民战胜今年首次洪水，保护了三百多万亩水稻良好生长。
    今年岷江上游的首次洪水是在六月十六日到达都江堰的，水势很猛，外江洪峰曾高出危险水位，内江也仅差二市寸就到危险水位，延续时间比往年都长。洪水侵袭中，当地党政机关干部都带领农民到险要堤岸日夜和洪水展开搏斗。外江金马河沿岸数处重点工程曾被洪水冲毁，有两百亩农田被淹，经过近万名民工抢修以后，绝大部分农田得到挽救。抢险中，都江堰流域各县的农民相互支援。仅彭县、崇宁两县出动编护岸竹笼的工人就有两百多人；郫县、崇宁、崇庆、双流等县农民，在三天内运送到灌县、温江两县抢修工地的竹料约四十万斤。目前，都江堰流域十五个县、市的防洪机构正积极领导农民作好各项准备工作，以防御洪水的再度侵袭。　（新华社）
