    Forest Survey Team in Jianfeng Ridge
    In the southwest corner of Hainan Island, there is a mountain that rises more than 1,390 meters above sea level. This is the famous Jianfeng Ridge in Dongfang County. Surrounding Jianfeng Ridge are countless large and small mountains, and this area of approximately 300 square kilometers is entirely dense, primeval forest. Many precious and rare timbers grow here, including conifers such as Cunninghamia lanceolata, Keteleeria evelyniana, and Podocarpus nagi, as well as broad-leaved trees such as Prunus mume, Rhodoleia championii, Castanopsis chinensis, and Rhaphiolepis indica. Useful plants such as Gnetum parvifolium and Livistona chinensis also grow under the trees. These timbers have a wide range of uses, including shipbuilding materials for deep-sea fishing vessels and railway sleepers for high-speed railways.
      In order to investigate this rich forest resource for rapid development and utilization, a forest survey team composed of professional forest surveyors from the Guangdong Provincial Department of Forestry and the Hainan Administrative Region Forestry Office began surveying here in April this year. Survey team members climbed over mountain after mountain, passed through jungles, and crawled through shrubs or vines full of thorns. Some places had no roads at all and required cutting through thorns to proceed. When working on the edge of the forest area, the scorching sun caused them to sweat profusely, and then a sudden rainstorm would soak them to the bone. Every evening at sunset, a loud song could be heard in the silent forest, as the survey team members returned to their camp with the results of a day's work. The camp was made of wooden frames erected in the forest, covered with thatch and Livistona chinensis leaves. They rested here and also sorted, checked, and calculated the day's survey data. A hole dug on the adjacent slope, with a cooking pot placed on it, served as their kitchen. The work was difficult and the life was hard, but when they saw that they were making new contributions to the motherland every day, they forgot their fatigue, forgot their hardship, and increased their courage and determination to overcome difficulties.
    The Li ethnic compatriots are particularly enthusiastic about the forest survey work. The Li compatriots who worked as surveyors played a great role in opening roads and cutting survey lines. Local Li men and women have always been strong supporters of the survey team in completing the transportation of grain, tools, and other materials. On one occasion, Li compatriots from Dakai Township transported grain to the survey team. Because they got lost, they searched from 10:00 a.m. until 5:00 p.m. without finding the survey team's camp. They prepared to spend the night on the mountain if they couldn't find it and search again the next day. By chance, they met survey team members returning from work and were taken to the camp.
    By the end of June, they had grasped detailed information and figures for more than 150 square kilometers of forest area on Jianfeng Ridge. Now that the rainy season has arrived, the fieldwork of the forest survey will be temporarily suspended, and the team members will return to the city to carry out indoor work such as drawing, calculating, and designing. Three months later, they will enter this forest again to complete the remaining survey tasks. (Liang Tai'ran)

### 森林调查队在尖峰岭上

    森林调查队在尖峰岭上
    在海南岛的西南角上，有一座高出海面一千三百九十多公尺的山峰，这就是东方县境内的著名的尖峰岭。环绕着尖峰岭的还有无数大小山岭，在这大约三百平方公里的面积上，完全是密茂的原始森林。这里生长着很多珍贵希罕的木材，有陆均松、鸡毛松、竹叶松等针叶树，也有青梅、红罗、鸡占、龙角等阔叶树，林树下还长满了鸡藤、蒲葵等有用植物。这些木材的用途很广，有深海作业渔轮的造船材，也有高速铁路的枕木用材。
      为了调查这一处丰饶的森林资源，以便迅速开发利用，今年四月间，由广东省人民政府林业厅和海南行署林业处的专业森林调查员所组成的森林调查队，在这里开始了调查工作。调查队员们爬过一重又一重的高山，穿过丛林，在长满了刺针的灌木或藤萝中钻来钻去，有些地方根本没有道路，需要砍开荆棘才能前进。在林区边缘工作的时候，烈日晒得满身汗水，忽儿一阵暴雨，又淋得满身透湿。每当夕阳西下的时候，寂静的森林里便可以听到嘹亮的歌声，调查队员们带着一天工作的成果返回宿营地了。宿营地是在林中用木头搭起棚架，盖上一些茅草和蒲葵叶，他们在这里休息，也在这里整理、核对、计算一天的调查资料。旁边的斜坡上挖一个洞，搁上饭锅，那就是他们的厨房。工作是困难的，生活是艰苦的，但当他们看到自己每天对祖国都有新的贡献时，就忘记了疲劳，忘记了艰苦，更增加了克服困难的勇气和决心。
    黎族同胞对森林调查工作特别热情，担任测工的黎族同胞，在开辟道路、伐开测线中起了很大的作用。在完成粮食、工具等物资运输方面，当地男女黎胞始终是调查队的有力支持者。有一次，大凯乡的黎族同胞挑运粮食送给调查队，由于迷失了道路，从上午十时一直找到下午五时也没有找到调查队的宿营地。他们准备如果再找不到便在山上露宿一夜，第二天再找，碰巧遇到了收工回队的调查队员，才把他们带到宿营地。
    到六月底为止，尖峰岭上已经有一百五十平方公里以上的森林面积，被他们掌握了详细的情况和数字。现在，雨季已经来到，森林调查的野外工作也将暂时停止，队员们回到城里进行绘图、计算、设计等室内工作。三个月以后，他们又将进入这个森林，完成剩下的调查任务。　（梁泰然）
