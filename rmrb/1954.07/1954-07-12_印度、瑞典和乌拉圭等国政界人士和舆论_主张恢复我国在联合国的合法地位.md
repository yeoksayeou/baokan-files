Xinhua News Agency, July 11th: Politicians and newspapers in India are advocating that the People's Republic of China should have a legitimate position in the United Nations and the Security Council. The newspapers also criticized the unrealistic attitude of the United States towards China.

According to Agence France-Presse, former Indian Ambassador to China, K.M. Panikkar, told reporters in Madras on July 9th that India has always believed that the legitimate Chinese representative to the United Nations can only be the government that actually governs mainland China. As far as India is concerned, there is no room for dispute on this point. He pointed out that there could be no question of veto on this issue.

"Indian Express" pointed out: India and some other countries support and approve of the participation of the real Chinese representatives in the United Nations and its affiliated agencies.

"Amrita Bazar Patrika" pointed out that only "American politicians and diplomats" are satisfied with the Kuomintang remnants in Taiwan who have usurped the legitimate position of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations. "Hindustan Standard" criticized the US policy in Asia, saying that in view of the new balance of power in Asia, India believes that it is necessary to recognize the importance of China. "The Hindustan Times" said that whether the United States likes it or not, the indisputable fact is that the Geneva Conference showed that China has been universally recognized as an international force. The newspaper said in a commentary: "The Geneva Conference has marked a universal recognition that Communist China is a world power." It added: "As a matter of right and a measure of realism, India has always favored China's participation in the United Nations."

"National Herald" said in an editorial: "The ideas and faces of New China have made a good—possibly permanent—impression on the rest of the world." The newspaper accused the United States of "failing to take a morally sound position" on the China issue, and pointed out that this attitude of the United States "is due to its unwillingness to abide by the consequences of peaceful coexistence." It said: "Coexistence will mean collective peace and security, and the elimination of the threat of war."

Xinhua News Agency, Stockholm, July 10th, TASS: "Stockholm News" published an editorial on July 10th, commenting on the differences of opinion between Western countries on the China issue. "Stockholm News" said that without China participating as an equal country, it is impossible to reach any agreement on easing tensions in Southeast Asia. Most Europeans cannot understand why the United States takes such an attitude on this issue. The newspaper said that on this side of the Atlantic, the US policy clearly gives a very unrealistic impression.

"Stockholm News" finally criticized the US attitude towards China's participation in the United Nations, and said: "Wouldn't it be better, as the Swedish government has repeatedly demanded, to turn the United Nations into an organization that includes all countries?"

Xinhua News Agency, Montevideo, July 10th, TASS: Uruguayan newspapers pointed out that the international prestige of the People's Republic of China is increasing day by day, and demanded the restoration of its legitimate rights in the United Nations. The newspapers criticized the US for obstructing China from obtaining a seat in the United Nations.

The bourgeois newspaper "El Día" pointed out: Many capitalist countries support the demand to restore China's rights in the United Nations. The newspaper emphasized that restoring the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China is very important for peace.

"El Bien Público" wrote: "People from all walks of life in capitalist countries believe that the People's Republic of China should be granted a seat in the United Nations and that diplomatic and trade relations should be established with it."

The newspaper also said that the consistent and resolute peaceful policy adopted by the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union at the Geneva Conference, and the visits of Premier Zhou Enlai of the People's Republic of China to India and Burma, have strengthened China's international position and won great sympathy for this young Asian republic on the international stage.

The newspaper condemned the blackmail and threat policy adopted by the US State Department against the People's Republic of China. "El Bien Público" demanded that the Uruguayan government pay attention to the voices of the Uruguayan people, and adopt an independent stance on the issue of recognizing the rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations and establishing diplomatic and commercial relations with it.

    印度、瑞典和乌拉圭等国政界人士和舆论
    主张恢复我国在联合国的合法地位
    【新华社十一日讯】印度政界人士和报纸主张中华人民共和国应在联合国和安理会中有合法地位。各报并抨击美国对中国的不现实态度。
    据法新社报道，前印度驻我国大使潘尼迦七月九日在马德拉斯告记者说，印度一向认为，参加联合国的合法中国代表只能是实际上治理中国大陆的政府。就印度而论，这一点是没有什么争论的余地的。他指出，在这个问题上，不可能有否决权的问题。
      “印度快报”指出：印度和一些其他国家都是支持和赞成由真正的中国代表参加联合国和它的附属机构。
    “甘露市场报”指出，只有“美国政客和外交家”才对篡夺了中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法地位的台湾国民党残余分子感到满意。“印度斯坦旗报”抨击美国在亚洲的政策，它说，鉴于亚洲新的力量的对比关系，印度认为必须承认中国的重要性。“印度斯坦时报”说，不管美国喜欢不喜欢，无可争辩的事实是，日内瓦会议表明，中国已被普遍承认是一支国际力量。这家报纸在一篇评论中说：“日内瓦会议已标志着人们普遍承认共产党中国是世界大国。”它又说：“作为一个权利的问题和衡量现实主义的标尺，印度一直赞成中国参加联合国。”
      “国民先驱报”在社论中说：“新中国的思想和面貌已使世界其他国家产生了好的——可能是永久的——印象。”这家报纸指责美国对中国问题“不能采取合乎道义的立场”，并指出，美国这种态度
  “是由于它不愿意遵守和平共处的后果”。它说：“共处将意味着集体和平与安全，及消除战争威胁。”
      【新华社十一日讯】塔斯社斯德哥尔摩十日讯：“斯德哥尔摩新闻”七月十日发表社论，评论西方国家之间在对待中国问题上的意见分歧。“斯德哥尔摩新闻”说，没有中国作为一个平等的国家参加，要想在缓和东南亚紧张局势问题上取得任何协议是不可能的。大多数欧洲人不能了解美国在这个问题上为什么采取这样的态度。这家报纸说，在大西洋的这一边，美国的政策很明显地给人一种极不现实的印象。
    “斯德哥尔摩新闻”最后批评了美国对中国参加联合国问题的态度，它说：“如瑞典政府所一再要求的，把联合国变成一个包括所有国家在内的组织，那不是更好些吗？”
    【新华社十一日讯】据塔斯社蒙得维的亚十日讯：乌拉圭各报指出中华人民共和国的国际威望在日渐提高，并要求恢复它在联合国的合法权利。各报批评了美国阻挠中国取得联合国席位的态度。
    资产阶级报纸“晨报”指出：许多资本主义国家都支持恢复中国在联合国的权利的要求。这家报纸强调指出：恢复中华人民共和国的合法权利对于和平是非常重要的。
    “公理报”写道：“资本主义国家内的各阶层人士都认为应该让中华人民共和国取得联合国中的席位，并应和它建立外交和贸易关系。”
    这家报纸又说，中华人民共和国和苏联在日内瓦会议上所采取的一贯的、坚决的和平政策和中华人民共和国总理周恩来的访问印度和缅甸已加强了中国的国际地位，并在国际舞台上为这个年轻的亚洲共和国赢得了极大的同情。
    这家报纸谴责美国国务院对中华人民共和国所采取的讹诈和威胁政策。“公理报”要求乌拉圭政府注意乌拉圭人民的呼声，并在承认中华人民共和国在联合国的权利以及和它建立外交和商务关系的问题上，采取独立的立场。
