The CPC Anshan Municipal Committee convened an enlarged committee meeting from May 8th to June 29th to convey and study the resolution of the Seventh Central Committee's Fourth Plenary Session of the CPC and the documents of the Northeast Regional Party's Senior Cadres Meeting. The comrades attending the meeting unanimously supported the report made by Comrade Liu Shaoqi on behalf of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong at the Seventh Central Committee's Fourth Plenary Session, the "Resolution on Strengthening Party Unity" passed by the Plenary Session, and the various documents of the Northeast Regional Party's Senior Cadres Meeting. The meeting held that Anshan's work had achieved certain successes due to the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the original iron and steel industrial foundation of Anshan, the strong support of the central government and higher authorities, especially the correct policy determined by the central government for the construction of Ansteel, the extensive assistance provided by the Soviet Union, the support of the people across the country, and the active efforts of all Communist Party members, workers, and laborers in Anshan. The meeting considered that the Municipal Committee had basically implemented the central government's line and policies, and the Municipal Committee was basically united; however, at the same time, the Municipal Committee also had many shortcomings and errors in its leadership work and in the specific implementation of the central government's policies. The meeting seriously examined and criticized the errors made by the Municipal Committee and the Municipal Committee members on the issue of Party unity, criticized the serious arrogance of the Municipal Committee's leadership, and the shortcomings and errors existing in collective leadership. Relevant personnel conducted self-criticism. The participants unanimously felt that through this meeting, they had raised their political awareness and revolutionary vigilance, recognized the importance of the Party's unity being above all else and the danger of individualistic arrogance, promoted the style of intra-Party democracy with criticism and self-criticism, and strengthened the unity of the Municipal Committee, laying the foundation for further promoting intra-Party democracy, carrying out criticism and self-criticism, strengthening collective leadership, and enhancing Party unity in the future.

    根据四中全会决议批判工作中的缺点和错误
    中共鞍山市委员会从五月八日到六月二十九日召开了委员会扩大会议，传达和学习了中共七届四中全会决议和东北地区党的高级干部会议的文件。与会同志一致拥护刘少奇同志受中共中央政治局和毛泽东同志委托在中共七届四中全会上所作的报告和全会通过的“关于增强党的团结的决议”以及东北地区党的高级干部会议的各项文件。会议认为，鞍山市的工作由于党中央和毛主席的英明领导，由于鞍山原来已有一定的钢铁工业基础，由于中央和上级的大力支持，特别是中央所确定的建设鞍钢的正确方针，由于苏联给予多方面的大量的援助，由于全国各地人民的支援以及鞍山市全体共产党员、全体职工和劳动人民的积极努力，因而取得了一定的成绩。会议认为，市委基本上执行了中央的路线和政策，市委基本上是团结的；但同时市委在领导工作中和具体贯彻中央的政策方面也存在着许多缺点和错误。会议认真地检查和批判了市委和市委委员在党的团结问题上所犯的错误，批判了市委领导方面的严重的骄傲情绪和在集体领导上存在的缺点和错误。有关人员都进行了自我批评。与会人员一致感到，经过这次会议，提高了政治觉悟和革命警惕性，认识了党的团结的利益高于一切的重要性和个人主义骄傲情绪的危险性，发扬了党内民主同批评和自我批评的风气，增强了市委的团结，为今后进一步发扬党内民主、开展批评和自我批评，加强集体领导和增强党的团结打下了基础。
    为了大力贯彻党的七届四中全会的决议，市委扩大会议根据鞍山的具体情况，决定在干部中着重进行党的团结的教育，认真地严格地检查和批判干部中的骄傲情绪，勇敢地揭发工作中的缺点和错误，展开自下而上的和公开的批评和自我批评，给批评以支持；加强市委的集体领导，加强思想上组织上的统一，强调相互合作和配合，反对分散主义和本位主义；一切党员都必须经常参加党的组织生活，接受党组织和党员群众的批评和监督；加强对马克思列宁主义和党的政策指示的学习，加强党的思想领导，克服实际工作中轻视党的政治工作的偏向；加强党对企业的保证和监督，同时继续贯彻厂长负责制。会议强调指出：全体党员干部要把维护党的统一和团结当作经常的最重要的任务。要提高政治嗅觉和革命警惕性，反对资产阶级个人主义，加强党性锻炼，向一切不利于党的团结的言论和行为进行斗争。　（新华社）
