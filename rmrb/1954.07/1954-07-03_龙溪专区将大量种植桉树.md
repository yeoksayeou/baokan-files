    Longxi Special District to Plant Eucalyptus Trees on a Large Scale
    Longxi Special District in Fujian Province will utilize barren hills to plant eucalyptus trees on a large scale. In order to improve the survival rate of afforestation, the forest farm in the special district began planting 1,400 mu of eucalyptus trees on a trial basis this spring, and also purchased a large number of eucalyptus seeds from Zhangzhou, Xiamen and other places, preparing to expand seedling cultivation next spring. In mid-May, the Forestry Section of the Special District also held a forestry production conference for the entire special district to discuss and study the steps to carry out this work. At present, nurseries and forest farms in various counties are vigorously nurturing eucalyptus seedlings. About six million mu of barren hills in the southern part of the special district are suitable for planting eucalyptus trees, and it is planned to plant more than 171,000 mu of eucalyptus trees within four years.

    龙溪专区将大量种植桉树
    福建省龙溪专区利用荒山将大量种植桉树。为了提高造林成活率，今年春季该专区林场开始试种了一千四百亩桉树，并且还到漳州、厦门等地大量采购桉树种子，准备明春扩大育苗。五月中旬，该专区林业科还召开了全专区林业生产会议，讨论研究开展这项工作的步骤。目前各县苗圃和林场正在大力抚育桉树苗。该专区南部地区约有六百万亩荒山适宜种植桉树，计划在四年内种植十七万一千多亩桉树。（陈霖坤）
