    Strengthen Book Distribution Work
    Chen Wen
    Strengthening distribution work, delivering excellent and beneficial books to readers, meeting the people's growing cultural needs, and promoting the development of the publishing industry are indispensable steps in the Party's ideological and political education of the people.
    The Party relies heavily on books to carry out ideological education of the masses. If socialism does not occupy the ideological front, capitalism will. The bourgeoisie is trying to influence the thoughts and lives of the working people through the publication and distribution of books. This is especially important in the presence of private publishing. We must increase the publication of high-quality books that promote socialist thought and greatly expand the distribution of these books to counter the circulation of bad books that poison the people's minds. This is one of the serious political tasks on the cultural front.
    Books are the crystallization of human knowledge. But the publication of a book is only the beginning of its life journey. Its fate depends on the comments of the media and the reflections of readers, and also on the quality of distribution. Distributors bear great responsibility for the fate of books.
    Since liberation, the national book distribution network has greatly developed, the enthusiasm of bookstore staff has greatly increased, and the number of books distributed has grown daily. However, not all bookstore staff comrades have fully recognized the political significance of distribution work. After opposing forced distribution and correcting the tendency to blindly pursue business figures, some comrades have developed the illusion that it doesn't matter whether more or fewer books are distributed. Forced distribution is a political error; distributing fewer books is just less business, not a political problem. They don't realize that opposing forced distribution is precisely to consolidate the work foundation and carry out distribution work more effectively. Unreasonably reducing the distribution of books will reduce the political role of books and affect the people's cultural life. Precisely because of this lack of understanding, some bookstores do not pay enough attention to business plans, and do not regard them as a reflection of political tasks that must be completed 100%. Some did not formulate a plan at all for the first quarter; some leaders had a plan, but did not mobilize the masses to discuss it and formulate guarantee measures; some did not check the implementation or did not check it in a timely manner. As a result, the Xinhua Bookstore's total sales plan for the first quarter (which was not higher than the same period last year) was only 90% completed, and tens of millions of books were stockpiled in warehouses and not distributed. In many places, books promoting the Party's general line were repeatedly out of stock, and the supply of scientific and technical books was also poorly done... All of these have had a negative impact on the Party's propaganda work and the country's construction work. Distributors must increase their political responsibility, complete and strive to over fulfill the book distribution plan on time, and ensure the success of the Party's propaganda work; at no time should they have negative or slack emotions.
    Urban distribution work should be greatly strengthened, but rural distribution work is also an important aspect of distribution work and must not be relaxed in the slightest. Chairman Mao said long ago: "The serious problem is to educate the peasants." With the accelerated pace of the socialist transformation of agriculture and the participation of large numbers of educated youths in rural work, rural distribution is becoming increasingly important. Rural readers need a large number of popular reading materials, which are thin, inexpensive, and very difficult to distribute. Bookstore staff comrades carry books to the countryside to peddle them, walking more than a dozen villages a day, sweating profusely, and often only selling books worth 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. Some comrades therefore feel great disappointment. But this way of looking at problems solely from the perspective of "total value" is a purely profit-seeking viewpoint that is divorced from politics. All work should be viewed from a political perspective. Rural distribution should not only be seen as how much money is made, but also as how many books are distributed, whether the distributed books are suitable for the needs of the countryside, and what political role they play among the peasant masses. Rural distribution work is very arduous work, and necessary assistance and rewards should be given to those rural distribution workers who work tirelessly and diligently to encourage books to go to the countryside.
    Distributors must investigate the needs of readers, study the quality of books, and ensure a sufficient supply of all published beneficial books, avoiding both out-of-stock situations and stockpiling. Stockpiling prevents books from meeting readers, and out-of-stock situations reduce the distribution of books, both of which will reduce the political role of books. The current stockpiling of books in bookstores is very serious, which is due to blind purchasing and poor sales efforts, and should be actively solved by expanding distribution. However, some places are doing the opposite. Because the stockpiling of inventory is causing capital turnover problems, they are blindly cutting orders, even refusing to order good books that are widely needed by many readers. According to a survey by the Xinhua Bookstore Beijing Distribution Office, some books are not ordered by more than 400 places, and some books are not ordered by more than 1,000 places. These books that are not ordered include new good books that promote the general line, conduct class education and labor education, discuss youth self-cultivation, and explain the policy of agricultural mutual aid and cooperation. This passive approach not only fails to get the bookstore out of its difficulties, but also makes the bookstore's business sluggish, reduces its service to readers, and hinders the development of the national publishing industry. The out-of-stock situation of published books is possible and must be overcome and prevented. To date, the material strength of the national publishing industry can fully guarantee the sufficient printing of published books, and there is no temporary problem of productivity not keeping up with objective needs. The current out-of-stock situation of published books is due to many shortcomings in publishing and distribution work. If we do our work better, this out-of-stock phenomenon can be gradually reduced and eliminated. The view that the out-of-stock situation of published books is inevitable is incorrect. It will foster our complacency and hinder us from taking active measures to improve distribution work.
    It should be admitted that book distribution work has encountered some difficulties since the beginning of this year. Some bookstores, although working hard, are still unable to complete the distribution plan. This is mainly because we have not yet mastered the new laws of distribution. After the country entered the era of planned economic construction, certain changes have taken place in readers' needs for books and the publication status of books. In the early days of liberation, when our country was still in the stage of social reform, the publishing record was overwhelmingly dominated by pamphlets that accompanied political movements and general political theory books. These types of reading materials were commonly needed by the majority of cadres and intellectuals, and their distribution was relatively quick and simple. At that time, it was often possible to rely on a sudden, large-scale distribution method to complete the distribution task. Now it is different. Our publishing industry has begun to publish some specialized and even more profound theoretical works, science and technology books, and cultural and educational reading materials. The variety of publications is increasing, and readers' demands for books are becoming increasingly complex and strict. This is a normal and reasonable phenomenon. However, this objective change has made it more difficult for our distributors to combine books with readers' needs. We must more deeply and meticulously understand books and understand readers, and take more proactive and active sales methods to accurately find the owner of different types of books. If we do not do this, but are satisfied with the existing work foundation and investigation materials, stick to conventions, handle affairs according to old ideas and old regulations, and adopt the old set of distribution methods, we will not be able to carry out our work well, books will not be distributed, and readers' demands cannot be met in a timely manner.
    The above are just big changes. In addition, there are many specific changes that we must pay attention to and grasp at any time. For example, some agricultural cities are now being built into industrial cities, the composition of urban residents has changed greatly, and the books they need are also different. Originally, the range of books needed in rural areas was relatively narrow, but now, because a large number of senior elementary school and junior high school students are participating in rural work, there are new readers and new needs. With the rapid development of economic construction, the demand for science and technology books has greatly increased. Now, not only engineers, technicians, and college students are reading science and technology books, but also veteran technicians and young apprentices. Some science and technology books are commonly needed, but most science and technology books are specialized. This enterprise and school urgently need them, but that enterprise and school have no use for them. Many out-of-school teenagers need to buy textbooks in order to study at home. It is no longer permissible for bookstores not to sell textbooks retail. All of this shows that distributors must persistently conduct investigation and research, and treat investigation and research work as regular work. Only by doing a good job of investigation and research can we do a good job of distribution work.
    Publicizing and promoting books so that newly published books are known to the majority of readers is the basic work for expanding book distribution. Because "The Gadfly" was widely publicized, 660,000 copies were distributed; while "Far from Moscow," which is more politically and ideologically significant than the former, and has greater practical educational significance for the majority of cadres and youths, was only distributed 155,000 copies because it was not publicized so enthusiastically nationwide. This proves that books need to be publicized. Of course, publicizing books cannot rely solely on the strength of bookstores. Newspapers, magazines, and publishing houses should all be responsible for publicizing and reviewing books. But bookstores should also be responsible for the task of publicizing and promoting books. At present, bookstores and publishing houses are too weak in publicizing books, and have not fully utilized the many powerful publicity forces and weapons in society. The organizations of the Party, the Communist Youth League, and the trade union in many organs, groups, enterprises, and schools can and are willing to publicize good books and periodicals. Some places have also organized report meetings and discussion meetings on certain books. Many bookstores have noticed this situation and have established contact and cooperation with them, thereby expanding the distribution of books. But there are also many bookstores that not only do not organize and use this force, but even when many units in the local area have begun to study and discuss a certain book, they are still unprepared in terms of supply. Newspapers, magazines, radio stations, slides, and posters are all good tools for publicizing books. An international friend once asked us such a question: Why not use the Russian language lecture on the radio station to introduce the distribution of Russian textbooks? Wouldn't its effect be much greater than advertising? This shows that we are still very unskilled in publicity work. We should use various different publicity forces and publicity tools according to different books and adapt to different readers.
    To expand distribution, we must also adhere to and promote correct distribution methods. Over the years, distributors have created many good experiences. Some distribution methods have proven to be effective. But promoting this experience and method widely does require struggle. Any advanced experience will not be valued if it is not promoted; and after it has been promoted, if attention is not paid to adhering to its implementation, it will gradually be forgotten and abandoned. Mobile supply is one of the most convenient service methods for readers. Last year, during the increase production and practice economy campaign, books distributed by Xinhua Bookstore using this method accounted for about 20% of total sales. But in the first quarter of this year, many stores relaxed the work of mobile supply, reducing it to only 7% or 8% of sales. This alone means that about 20 million fewer books were distributed. We should constantly conduct supervision and inspection and promptly correct this phenomenon of working hard for a short period and then becoming lax. To promote new advanced experiences, we need to take more effective measures. For example: investigate and research, concentrate and summarize these experiences, analyze the conditions for their generation, organize visits and studies, overcome the ideological obstacles that may be encountered in the promotion process, train cadres, and conduct experiments on a larger scale, and so on. In this regard, simply issuing general calls is completely insufficient. General calls must be guaranteed by specific organizational measures.
    The service attitude and service methods of bookstore outlets need to be greatly improved. Business hours must be adapted to the readers' living habits, and must not adopt the same work schedule as general organs and groups. The employees' working hours and leisure hours are the peak hours for outlets, when more than 50% of readers come to the store throughout the day. On Sundays and holidays, we should serve readers no matter what. Some outlets often temporarily close their doors on the grounds of holding meetings, studying, or even holding evening parties, causing readers to be disappointed. This is a very bad style of work and cannot be allowed to continue. The books displayed in the outlets should be many, and samples of the books in the warehouse should be displayed, and should be easy for readers to browse and select. They should not be kept on high shelves. The attitude towards readers should be amiable, and attention should be paid to helping readers select books. There must not be the slightest impatience, so that readers can go back with a happy mood whether they have bought books or not. The quality of the service attitude to readers is a concrete manifestation of the strength of the mass viewpoint. The Party branch should lead the Communist Youth League and the trade union to mobilize employees to regularly and consciously check labor discipline and service attitude, and conduct appropriate commendations and criticisms.
    The unreasonable labor organization will affect the development of distribution business. At present, the problems with bookstores are: the management structure is too large, there are too many management personnel, there are not enough sales units, and there are too few sales personnel. In some branches and sub-branches, the personnel who do management work account for about 40% of all personnel. Some individual sub-branches have a total quota of only a dozen people, but they have a management team of manager, deputy manager, secretary, accountant, statistician, warehouse manager, etc. None of these people assume sales tasks, so the distribution power is very limited. Several places have discovered this drawback and are determined to adjust the labor organization. Only three people are left inside the sub-branch, one is the manager, one is the accountant and statistician who also takes care of picking up goods, and one is the outlet salesperson who also manages the warehouse. The majority of personnel are transferred to sell books outside, which strengthens the distribution business. But the problem does not only occur in the sub-branch. Management agencies at all levels should be greatly streamlined. As many personnel as possible should be transferred to establish new branches, outlets, and book stalls, and increase the force directly engaged in sales. At present, the distribution network in many large and medium-sized cities is very unsound. Often, there are only outlets on a few main streets, and it is very inconvenient for readers to buy books. Personnel should be transferred to set up many new sales bases to truly form a dense "network."
    The key to strengthening distribution work lies in improving the leadership of bookstores. After the start of the Soviet Union's first five-year economic construction plan, Comrade Stalin repeatedly emphasized the need for practical leadership and the need to replace the old leadership methods with new ones. In "New Situation and New Tasks of Economic Construction," he said: In order to achieve new-style leadership, "our economic work leaders should not lead enterprises 'generally,' not lead enterprises 'from the air,' but lead enterprises specifically and practically." He requires leaders to often inspect factories and enterprises, spend more time working there, get to know the staff more carefully, maintain living contacts with them, check the implementation of work, familiarize themselves with "small things," and solve problems on the spot. Comrade Stalin's teachings are completely useful for leaders of bookstores as enterprises. Our leaders should carefully check whether they are too superstitious of issuing orders on paper and too little going down to check the actual work situation. Checking the implementation of work cannot be done once a quarter, let alone once a year. Like this year, the distribution plan for the first quarter could not be completed, and it was not discovered until March, and because they were not familiar with the details and lacked effective measures, they have not been able to reverse the situation to this day. Such days cannot continue. Inspections should be carried out month by month and ten days at a time, and problems should be discovered and resolved in a timely manner. Many management stores do visit the lower levels for inspection work on a regular basis. However, this inspection must not be a cursory glance, not mostly limited to collecting various facts and materials, but more to discuss things with the actual staff below, concentrate their experience and wisdom, and give real assistance. The situations, problems, and experiences found in one place should be promptly reminded to other places, especially the newly created mature experiences should be paid more attention to promote. Do not keep a little bit and lose the overall picture. Some provincial branch leaders gathered the bookstore staff from nearby counties to hold a "piece meeting" after having real gains in checking work in the county to expand the results of the inspection. This experience can be emulated. In short, our leaders must make themselves not lag behind life, not be divorced from reality, and not be bureaucratic.
    Our Party's policy is correct, the people's cultural life is rising, and social purchasing power is increasing, requiring us to supply more and better books; the country's publishing industry is gradually developing to adapt to this situation, as long as we firmly rely on the Party, rely on the masses, and work hard to improve our work, we can expand book circulation and enable books to play a more full role in educating the people.

    加强图书发行工作
    陈文
    加强发行工作，把优良的有益的书籍送到读者手中去，满足人民日益增长的文化生活的需要，并推动出版事业的发展，是党对人民进行思想、政治教育的不可缺少的步骤。
    党对人民群众的思想教育工作，许多方面要依靠书籍去进行。思想阵地，社会主义不去占领，资本主义就会去占领。资产阶级正在力图通过书籍的出版发行去影响劳动人民的思想和生活。这在私营出版业存在的情形下，特别值得注意。必须增加宣传社会主义思想的品质优良的书籍的出版，并大大地扩大这些书籍的发行，以抵制那些毒害人民心灵的坏书的流通。这是文化战线上的严重的政治任务之一。
    书籍是人类知识的结晶。但一本书籍的出版，只是它的生命的旅程的开始。它的命运如何，还得看舆论界的评论和读者的反映，同时，也要看发行的好坏。发行工作者对于书籍的命运负着很大的责任。
    解放以来，国家的书籍发行网有了很大的发展，书店工作人员的积极性大大地提高，发行的书籍的数目日益增长。可是，并不是所有书店工作同志对发行工作的政治意义都已有了充分的认识。在反对强迫摊派、纠正盲目追逐营业数字的偏向后，有些同志发生这样一种错觉：书籍多发行一些少发行一些没有关系。强迫摊派是政治错误，少发行一些，只是少作一些营业，不是政治问题。不知道反对强迫摊派，正是为了巩固工作基础，更切实有效地开展发行工作。不合理地减少书籍的发行，会降低书籍的政治作用，影响人民的文化生活。正因对于这点认识不清，有些书店对于业务计划很不重视，不把它看作政治任务的体现，必须百分之百地完成。有的第一季度根本没有订出计划；有的领导上虽有了一个计划，但没有发动群众讨论，订出保证措施；有的对执行情况不作检查或检查得不及时。结果，新华书店全店第一季度销货计划（这个计划并不比去年同期为高），只完成了百分之九十，上千万册书籍被积压在仓库里没有发行出去。许多地方宣传党的总路线的书籍一再脱销，科学技术书籍的供应工作也作得很不好……。这些都不能不对党的宣传事业和国家的建设工作给了不好的影响。发行工作者必须提高自己的政治责任心，按期完成并争取超额完成书籍发行计划，保证党的宣传事业的成功；在任何时候都不要有消极松懈的情绪。
    城市发行工作应该大大加强，但农村发行工作也是发行工作的一个重要方面，决不能丝毫放松。毛主席早就说过：“严重的问题是教育农民。”随着农业社会主义改造的加速进行，大批知识青年的参加农村工作，农村发行就愈益重要。农村读者需要大的是各类通俗读物，这种图书本子薄，价钱低，而且很不容易发行。书店工作同志背着书籍下乡兜销，一天走十多个村子，跑得满头大汗，往往只能销出二三十万元的书籍。有些同志因而感到很大的失望。但这种光从“码洋”来看问题，正是一种脱离政治的单纯营利观点。任何工作都应从政治上着眼，农村发行不能只看作了多少钱的营业，而要看发行了多少册书籍，发行的书籍是否适合农村的需要，在农民群众中起了什么政治作用。农村发行工作是很艰苦的工作，应该给那些不辞辛劳、埋头苦干的农村发行工作者以必要的帮助和奖励，以鼓励书籍下乡。
    发行工作者，必须调查读者的需要，研究书籍的品质，保证一切已出版的有益的书籍的充分供应，避免书籍的脱销和积压。积压使书籍不能和读者见面，脱销会减少书籍的发行，都将降低书籍的政治作用。现在书店的存书积压很严重，这是进货盲目和推销不力的缘故，应该积极地从扩大发行上谋求解决。但有些地方竟反其道而行，因为存货积压资金周转不灵，就盲目地削减订货，甚至对许多读者广泛需要的好书都一本不要。据新华书店北京发行所调查，有些书有四百多个地方一本不要，有些书有一千多个地方一本不要。在这些一本不要的书中，包括宣传总路线，进行阶级教育和劳动教育，论述青年修养，解释农业互助合作政策的新的好书。这种消极的做法，不但不能摆脱书店的困难，反而使得书店营业不振，减弱了对读者的服务，并阻碍了国家出版事业的发展。已出版的书籍的脱销，是可能也必须加以克服和防止的。迄今为止，国家的出版事业的物质力量，完全可以保证已出版的书籍的充分印制，暂时还并不存在生产力赶不上客观需要的问题。目前已出版的书籍脱销，是由于出版、发行工作上存在着许多缺点。如果我们的工作做得好一些，这种脱销现象是可以逐步减少和消灭的。那种认为已出版的书籍的脱销是不可避免的说法，是不对的。它会助长我们的麻痹自满情绪，妨碍我们采取积极的措施去改进发行工作。
    应该承认，今年开始，书籍发行工作是遇到一些困难的，有些书店虽然相当努力，仍然不能完成发行计划。这主要地是因为我们还没有掌握发行上的新的规律的缘故。在国家进入有计划经济建设以后，读者对于书籍的需要和书籍的出版状况，发生了某些变化。在解放初期，当我们的国家还处于社会改革阶段的时候，出版纪录上占压倒优势的是配合政治运动的小册子以及一般性的政治理论书籍，这类读物为广大干部和知识分子所共同需要，发行起来比较迅速和比较简单，那时常常可以依靠突击式的大量发行的方法，来完成发行任务。现在就不同了，我们出版界开始出版一些专门性的甚至比较高深的理论著作，科学技术书籍以及文化教育读物，出版物的品种日益繁多，而读者对于书籍的要求也日益复杂，日益严格。这本来是一种正常的合理的现象。但这种客观的变化，使得我们发行工作者要把书籍和读者的需要结合时，发生了一些新的困难。必须更深入、更细致地了解书、了解读者，并采取更多主动的、积极的推销办法，才能使不同品种的书籍准确地找到它的主人。如果我们不这样做，而以已有的工作基础和调查材料为满足，墨守成规，按旧观点，旧章程办事，采取老一套的发行方法，就不能很好地开展自己的工作，书籍会发不出去，读者的要求也不能及时地得到满足。
    上面所说的只是大的变化，此外，还有许多具体的变化，都要我们随时随地注意掌握。例如，有些农业城市现在建设为工业城市了，市内居民成分有了很大变化，所需要的书籍也就不同。本来农村所需要的书籍范围比较狭隘，现在因为大批高小和初中学生参加农村工作，有了新的读者和新的需要。随着经济建设的突飞猛进，科学技术书籍的需要量大增，现在阅读科学技术书籍的不仅有工程师、技术人员、大学生，而且有老年技工和青年学工，一部分科学技术书籍是通常需用的，但大部分科学技术书籍是专门性的，这个企业、学校迫切需要，那个企业、学校却并无用处。许多不在学的青少年，为了在家自修，必需购置课本，现在书店再不零售课本是不能允许的了。……所有这些说明：发行工作者必须坚持不懈地进行调查研究，把调查研究工作当作经常的工作，只有做好调查研究，才能做好发行工作。
    宣传和推广书籍，使新出版的书籍为广大读者所周知，是扩大书籍发行的基础工作。“牛虻”因为宣传得较多，发行了六十六万册；而“远离莫斯科的地方”，其政治性思想性远较前者为高，而且对于广大干部和青年具有更大的现实教育意义，但因在全国范围内不是宣传得那么热烈，只发行了十五万五千册。这证明书籍是需要宣传的。宣传书籍当然不能光靠书店的力量，报纸、杂志、出版社都应负责宣传和评介书籍，但书店也应担负书籍的宣传推广的任务。目前书店和出版社的书籍宣传是太微弱了，对于社会上许多强有力的宣传力量和武器没有充分地利用。许多机关、团体、企业、学校的党、青年团、工会的组织是可以也愿意宣传好的书刊的，有些地方还组织了某些书籍的报告会和讨论会，不少书店注意到了这种情况，跟他们取得联系和配合，从而扩大了书籍的发行。但也有许多书店不但不去组织和运用这种力量，甚至在当地许多单位都已开始学习和讨论某一书籍时，在供应工作上还毫无准备。报纸、杂志、广播电台、幻灯片、招贴牌等，都是宣传书籍的很好工具。曾经有一个国际友人向我们发出这样的疑问：发行俄语课本，为什么不利用电台的俄语讲座介绍一下，其效力不是比登广告大得多么？这说明我们还很不会作宣传工作。应该根据不同书籍，适应不同的读者对象，而运用各种不同的宣传力量和宣传工具。
    要扩大发行，还必须坚持和推广正确的发行方法。多少年来，发行工作者已经创造了不少好的经验。有些发行方法证明是行之有效的。但要广泛地推行这种经验和方法，不是不需要斗争的。任何先进经验如果不加推广，不会被人重视；而在已经推广以后，如果不注意坚持贯彻，也会逐渐地被人忘却和遗弃。流动供应是最便利读者的服务方式之一，去年增产节约运动时，新华书店用这种方法发行的书籍占全部销货数的百分之二十左右，可是今年第一季许多店放松了流动供应工作，降到了只占销货数的百分之七、八，只此一端就要少发行二千万册左右的书籍。应该不断地进行督促检查，及时地纠正这种一曝十寒的现象。对于推广新的先进经验，需要采取更多有效的办法。例如：调查研究，集中和总结这些经验，分析它们产生的条件，组织参观访问，克服在推广过程中可能遇到的思想障碍，训练干部，在更大的范围内进行实验，等等。在这方面，仅仅限于一般号召是完全不够的。一般号召要有具体的组织措施加以保证。
    书店门市的服务态度和服务方法需要大大改进。营业时间一定要适应读者的生活规律，决不能和一般机关、团体采用同样的作息时间表。职工的上下班时间和业余休憩时间，才是门市的忙市，这时读者上门的将占全日的百分之五十以上。星期天和假日无论如何应该为读者服务。有些门市往往以开会、学习甚至举行晚会为理由，临时关上大门，使读者扑空，这是十分恶劣的作风，不能允许其继续出现。门市陈列的书籍要多，仓库里有的书籍都要有样本摆出来，并要便于读者翻阅选购，不应束诸高阁。对读者的态度要和蔼，并注意帮助读者挑选书籍，决不能有丝毫不耐烦之处，做到读者无论是否买到书籍都能带着愉快的心情回去。对读者的服务态度好坏是群众观点强弱的具体表现。党支部应该领导青年团和工会，发动职工，经常自觉地检查劳动纪律和服务态度，并进行适当的表扬和批评。
    劳动组织的不合理，会影响发行业务的开展。目前书店的毛病是：管理机构太大，管理人员过多，销货单位不够，营业人员太少。有些分店、支店做管理工作的人员占了全部人员的百分之四十左右，个别支店总共只有十几个人的名额，却有经理、副经理、秘书、会计、统计、仓库管理员等一套管理班子，这些人都不担承销货任务，那样发行力量就很有限。若干地方发现了这种弊端，下决心调整劳动组织，在支店内部只留下三个人，一个是经理，一个是会计兼统计并兼取货，一个是门市营业员兼管仓库，而抽出大部分人员到外面去销书，就使发行业务得以加强。但问题不仅发生在支店，各级管理机构都应大大地精简，需要抽调尽可能多的人员，来建立新的支店、门市、书亭，并增加直接从事销货的力量。现在许多大中城市，发行网是很不健全的，往往只在几条大街上设有门市部，读者购书很不方便，正应该抽调人员来设立许多新的售书据点，使之真正构成一个稠密的“网”。
    加强发行工作的关键在改进书店的领导。斯大林同志在苏联第一个五年经济建设计划开始以后，就一再强调要有实际的领导，要以新的领导方式来代替旧的领导方式。他在“新的环境和新的经济建设任务”中说：为了实现新式的领导，“就要我们经济工作领导者不是‘一般地’领导企业，不是‘从空中’领导企业，而是具体切实地领导企业”。他要求领导者常常去巡视工厂企业，花更多时间留在那里工作，更仔细地认识工作人员，和他们维持活的联系，检查工作的执行情况，熟悉“小事情”，并就地解决问题。斯大林同志的这些教诲，对于作为企业的书店的领导者，是完全有用的。我们的领导工作者都应该认真地检查一下：是否有过于迷信纸上的发号施令，而太少到下面去检查实际工作的情况呢？检查工作的执行情况，不能一季一次，更不能一年一次，像今年那样第一季度发行计划不能完成，到三月份才发现，而且因为不熟悉详情，缺乏有效措施，至今不能把局面扭转过来，这样的日子是不能过下去的。应该逐月逐旬地进行检查，发现问题，及时解决。到下层去巡视工作，许多管理店倒是经常地在做的。但是，必须使这种巡视，不是走马观花式的，不是多半限于搜集各种事实和材料，而要更多地和下面实际工作人员商量事情，集中他们的经验和智慧，并给以真正的援助。在一个地方所发现的情况、问题和经验，应该及时地提醒其他地方，尤其是对那些新创造的成熟的经验，要多注意推广。不要把守了一点，丢掉了全面。有些省分店的领导者，到县里检查工作有了确实的收获后，召集附近县的书店的工作人员举行“片儿会”，扩大检查的成果，这种经验是可以效法的。总之，我们领导工作者，必须使自己不落后于生活，不脱离实际，不官僚化。
    我们的党的政策是正确的，人民的文化生活在高涨，社会购买力在提高，需要我们供给更多更好的书籍；国家的出版事业正在适应这种情况逐渐发展，只要我们坚决地依靠党，依靠群众，努力改进工作，是可以扩大书籍流通，使书籍更充分地发挥教育人民的作用的。
