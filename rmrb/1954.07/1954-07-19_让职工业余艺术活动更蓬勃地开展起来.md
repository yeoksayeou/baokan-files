    In recent years, amateur art activities of workers and staff have greatly developed. According to incomplete statistics, there are approximately 20,000 various amateur art groups in factories and mines across the country, with 500,000 active participants. After the commencement of national planned economic construction, relevant departments in various regions have more systematically organized professional artistic troupes and cultural service teams for construction sites to conduct touring performances, assisting workers and staff in carrying out various art activities. Major cities such as Shanghai, Wuhan, and Anshan have also established unified liaison organizations under relevant departments to guide local amateur art activities of workers and staff. Cities like Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Chongqing have not only organized professional artists to go to factories and mines for guidance but have also held various amateur training classes in music, dance, and drama, cultivating core members for these activities. The activities of various art groups in workers' cultural palaces, staff clubs, and cultural centers that have been successively established in cities across the country, as well as the mutual observation and exchange of experiences at observation performances or representative conferences of amateur art workers held in many cities, have further promoted the improvement of amateur art activities in many factories, mines, and enterprises on their original basis. This has gradually changed the situation that workers previously described as "every day is just work, meetings, eating, and sleeping," greatly enlivening the cultural life of workers and staff.

    However, judging from the current situation of amateur art activities of workers and staff and some opinions reflected by various regions, it is necessary to examine the principles and methods of carrying out amateur art activities of workers and staff in order to normally and widely carry out this activity, consolidate existing achievements, and improve it further.

    The regions where amateur art activities of workers and staff in factories and mines are carried out better are inseparable from the leadership of the Party committee of the unit, the support of the administration, the specific control of the trade union, the backbone role of the Youth League, and the active participation of the masses. For example, the Party committee of Beijing People's Printing Factory regards the development of amateur art activities of workers and staff as an important tool for carrying out communist education for workers, boosting morale, and promoting production. It conducts regular research and guidance, reviews important performance programs, and commends and encourages workers who actively participate in amateur art activities and are also very active in production. The trade union has specific plans and arrangements every quarter and every month, frequently reports to the Party committee, and actively strives for the Party committee's attention and support. The Youth League organization educates members to recognize that participating in amateur art activities is an important part of social work, urges branch committee members to participate in activities, and unites and educates all young workers through amateur art activities. At the same time, it has solved the problems of excessive concurrent positions of activists, as well as the issues of activity time and venues. Therefore, the factory's amateur art activities can be carried out relatively well, not only enriching the cultural life of workers but also playing a good educational role in coordination with political movements and production tasks.

    However, because amateur art activities have cooperated with the increase production and practice economy campaign, the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" Movements, and the central movements of the unit at the time, producing good propaganda effects, some leaders of the units believe that the content of amateur art activities of workers and staff should be completely "combined with the production of the factory, reflecting the production of the factory" and "achieve the purpose of timely cooperation with production." They do not understand that literary and artistic programs that reflect various aspects of national construction and people's struggles, and programs with healthy entertainment, can improve workers' awareness and relieve workers' fatigue, and therefore can also boost workers' production enthusiasm. Due to mechanically and rigidly requiring every program to be combined with the central tasks of the time and place, and even not allowing activities that are not combined with the production of the factory or workshop, the content of the activities has been greatly limited. Workers in a factory in Beijing wrote such plays themselves: the supply and marketing workshop has "sales of stagnant materials," the firing workshop has "drying ovens," and the packaging workshop has "packaging machines." Even more, a factory, when carrying out valuation work, the trade union asked the workers to write a script about the valuation. In this way, it is impossible not to have many boring and tedious things, and some are simply impossible to compile. Even if it is compiled, the content does not look like a play. No wonder the workers said with dissatisfaction: "In the morning, we listen to the chairman of the trade union giving a big report, and in the evening, watching the play is still a big report."

    This approach will also affect the regularity of activities. The Quyi group of a factory in Beijing reflected: "The Party committee instructed our Quyi activities to catch up with the movement and do a good job of propaganda. When the movement comes, we rush to compile, and after compiling, we rush to perform, and when we finish performing, it is over." They had compiled more than 2,300 singing lyrics, but most of them were in line with the central task or political propaganda, and after one or two performances, no one wanted to listen to them anymore. After the movement passed, there was no material, and the activity declined.

    There is no doubt that literature and art should serve politics and serve production. Similarly, the amateur art activities of workers and staff should also be subordinate to this general task. In order to promote the current work, it is entirely necessary and easier for the masses to accept to use appropriate forms such as Quyi and fine arts for propaganda and mobilization. But this kind of artistic propaganda and mobilization cannot be taken as the entire content of the amateur art activities of workers and staff. To require all art activities to introduce the operating process of various production technologies is actually denying the characteristics of literature and art and confusing the role of literature and art with the role of production technology illustrations. The amateur art activities of workers and staff are not just to cooperate with the central task and cooperate with production; its main task is also to establish the socialist labor attitude of workers and staff and cultivate their communist moral character. Therefore, on the one hand, we must adopt broad themes that reflect the new life and describe new characters, so that the workers and masses can receive education in many aspects; on the other hand, we must also pay attention to its proper entertainment nature. For many years, China's rich and diverse folk music and dance art has been mastered by the vast working masses. Last year, during the Spring Festival, in order to prevent most of the workers from other places from affecting their work due to homesickness, the Transportation Department of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant in Beijing launched amateur art activities among the workers. This time, they discovered experts in various art forms such as cross-talk, big drum, and pushing small carts.

    In carrying out amateur art activities of workers and staff, it is also necessary to prevent the tendency of deviating from politics and affecting production. The tendency to deviate from politics and affect production is often caused by the leaders of the unit neglecting this activity and adopting an attitude of indifference. The propaganda minister of the Party committee of a state-owned factory in Shanghai once said: "I think cultural and recreational activities are just jumping and jumping, and there is no political significance." This kind of view will allow the amateur art activities of workers and staff to fall into a state of self-flow. Many factories in cities have spent money to hire folk professional artists who have not been ideologically reformed to teach opera, magic, and acrobatics in the factory, thus performing beautiful and healthy folk dances into obscene dances, and even performing opera programs with bad images and insults to working women, and terrifying and barbaric acrobatics such as swallowing fire sticks and biting light bulbs. The activists of some units, proceeding from the preferences of a few people, are extravagant and wasteful, and often perform outside the factory. These situations not only seriously poisoned the workers' ideological awareness but also undermined labor discipline and affected production. Only when the leading cadres of factories, mines, construction sites, and enterprises clearly understand the principles and practices of this activity and attach importance to and actively lead this activity can the art activities of workers and staff be carried out normally.

    The methods and methods of amateur art activities of workers and staff should be based on the principles of amateur and voluntary. Because the main task of workers and staff is production. Carrying out the art activities of workers and staff is to meet their cultural life needs after production, so this activity must be carried out in spare time. The leaders of Beijing People's Printing Factory have made unified and proper arrangements for the time of workers' spare time study, meetings, and other activities outside of production, so that workers have a certain amount of entertainment time every day, which provides a strong guarantee for the factory to carry out amateur art activities; and makes workers realize that reasonably arranging spare time and carrying out appropriate cultural entertainment are more beneficial to production. However, some units often transfer some activists away from production to engage in activities in order to cooperate with the central task, which is also not in line with the principles of amateur art activities. Some units, when carrying out activities, do not take into account the different hobbies of everyone, and adopt rigid practices, and even force pregnant female workers to participate in strenuous group dances, which violates the principle of voluntariness. The mass nature of amateur art activities of workers and staff is not to require everyone to be organized into a certain activity, but to attract everyone to various activities that they love as much as possible.

    In order to consolidate and move forward on the existing basis of the art activities of workers and staff, it is not only necessary to clarify its principles and tasks, but also to continuously improve the level of artistic activities of workers and staff. "If popularization work is always stopped at a level, one month, two months, three months, one year, two years, three years, always the same stuff, the same 'Little Shepherd Boy', the same 'man, hand, mouth, knife, cow, sheep', then, aren't the educators and the educated both on a par? What is the significance of this kind of popularization work? The people demand popularization, and then they demand improvement, demanding improvement year by year and month by month." (Mao Zedong: "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art") In the past few years, many literary and art workers, under the guidance of Comrade Mao Zedong's literary and art policy of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, have enthusiastically gone to factories and mines to experience life or guide various amateur art activities of workers and staff, which has helped the development of the activities a lot. However, due to the lack of unified and planned organizational work by local cultural departments and trade unions for professional literary and art workers to guide the amateur art activities of workers and staff, and the lack of planning by professional literary and art groups for guidance work, it has been in a state of self-flow for a long time. The various units that went to the factory for guidance often had their own tasks and did not proceed from the actual needs of the factory. Everyone rushed to whatever factory had some prominent figures and major creations and inventions. For example, the Beijing Liulihe Cement Plant had 66 guidance cadres in 1952 alone; in September alone, 7 units with more than 40 people lived in the factory at the same time; in 1953, when the factory's amateur art activities could not be carried out, it became deserted, and no one went. The lack of unified organization and planning is also reflected in the inconsistent requirements of the guidance units and the guided units, and even mutual dissatisfaction.

    There are also some shortcomings in the guidance work itself. A music worker once asked the workers of a newly established military band in a factory to master the staff in one month. He also said: "You must know the staff, you can't learn musical instruments if you don't know it." This teaching method, which does not start from the existing level of amateur art activities of workers and staff, cannot achieve good results. Some guidance cadres, after going to the factory, are eager to achieve success, and do not pay attention to cultivating the backbone of the activities, and take over everything; as a result, it becomes lively when the guidance cadres come, and collapses after the guidance cadres leave. This situation is sometimes due to the fact that some grassroots trade unions do not assist the guidance cadres in their work well, and after introducing the situation, they ignore it. Another reason why the guidance work is not done well is that the leaders of those professional groups have not deeply checked and helped the work of the cadres who went out to do guidance. So there are "May Day Weaving Dance" in weaving factories, "Cigarette Packing Dance" in cigarette factories, and even "Painless Childbirth Dance" in hospitals. In order to promote Huang Runping's warehouse management method, there are also dances and dramas that express the operating process of production technology and machine movements such as the "Huang Runping Dance". This is also related to the influence of some professional literary and art workers' erroneous literary and art thoughts. Recently, due to the reorganization and implementation of enterprise management of cultural and art troupes in various regions, the guidance work for amateur art activities of workers and staff has actually been suspended in some units.

    The Beijing Municipal Cultural Affairs Management Office and the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions have organized and helped the professional literary and art groups in the capital this year to establish connections or sign contracts with some factories and mines respectively, and conduct guidance on a long-term and fixed basis. This method can be used as a reference for cultural departments, trade union organizations, and professional literary and art groups in various regions. The experience of the Beijing Amateur Art School, which is run by the Beijing Municipal Cultural Affairs Management Office, in training backbone members for amateur art activities of workers and staff in the past few years is also worth referring to by relevant departments in various regions. Cities with conditions can also hold local factory, mine, construction site, and enterprise worker art observation performances or competitions without affecting production, which is also an effective way to improve the art level of workers and staff.

    The supply of singing materials is also very important for the normal development and regularity of amateur art activities of workers and staff. At present, many boring and tedious things such as the operating process of production technology produced in activities in many factories and mines are on the one hand due to the leaders of those units emphasizing "combining with the production of the factory, reflecting the production of the factory" or requiring "achieving the purpose of timely cooperation with production"; on the other hand, it is also because professional literary and art workers cannot meet the needs of workers and staff. "Guiding the amateur art activities of the masses is another main task of the provincial and municipal literary federations. This guidance should focus on supplying materials for the amateur art activities of the masses and guiding the creation of the masses... Local literary and art publications should become an effective tool for discovering and cultivating local young writers, providing popular literary and art readings for the masses, and providing singing materials for the amateur art activities of the masses." (Zhou Yang: "Strive to Create More Excellent Literary and Art Works") If the provincial and municipal literary federations and local literary and art publications can seriously shoulder this responsibility, the amateur art activities of workers and staff will develop more healthily and vigorously.

    让职工业余艺术活动更蓬勃地开展起来
    朱树兰
    职工群众业余艺术活动，这几年来有很大的发展。据不完全的统计，全国厂矿企业的各种业余艺术小组约有二万个，参加活动的积极分子有五十万人。在全国有计划经济建设开始以后，各地主管机关更有计划地组织了专业文艺团体和工地文化服务队进行巡回演出，帮助职工群众开展各种艺术活动。上海、武汉、鞍山等大城市并成立了有关部门的统一联系机构来指导当地的职工业余艺术活动。北京、上海、广州、重庆等城市不但组织了专业文艺工作者下厂矿辅导，也举办了音乐、舞蹈、戏剧等各种艺术形式的业余训练班，培养活动中的骨干分子。全国大小城市相继成立的工人文化宫、职工俱乐部和文化馆的各种艺术小组活动，以及许多城市举办的观摩会演、或业余文艺工作者代表大会等的相互观摩、交流经验，更推动了很多厂矿、工地、企业的业余艺术活动在原有的基础上提高一步。逐渐改变了工人们过去所说的：“每天就是干活、开会、吃饭、睡觉”的情况，大大地活跃了职工群众的文化生活。
    但从目前职工群众业余艺术活动的开展情况，以及各地反映的一些意见来看，要正常地广泛地开展这一活动，巩固现有的成绩并提高一步，关于开展职工业余艺术活动的方针、方法等问题，还需要加以检查。
    各地厂矿职工业余艺术活动开展得较好的，都是和该单位党委的领导、行政的支持、工会的具体掌握、青年团的骨干作用，和群众的积极参加分不开的。例如北京人民印刷厂，党委把开展职工业余艺术活动看作是对职工进行共产主义教育、鼓舞职工情绪和推动生产的一种重要工具，定期地进行研究和指导，审查重要的演出节目，表扬和鼓励积极参加业余艺术活动而生产上又很积极的职工；工会在每季度和每月都有具体计划和布置，经常向党委汇报，主动争取党委的重视和支持；青年团组织教育团员认识参加业余艺术活动是社会工作的重要部分，督促各支部委员参加活动，通过业余艺术活动来团结和教育所有青年职工。同时，又解决了积极分子兼职过多，以及活动时间和场所等问题。因而，该厂的业余艺术活动能够开展得比较好，不但丰富了职工的文化生活，并配合政治运动和生产任务起了良好的教育作用。
    但是，由于业余艺术活动配合了增产节约、“三反”等政治任务和本单位当时当地的中心运动，产生了很好的宣传效果，某些单位的领导人便认为职工业余艺术活动的内容应该完全“结合本厂生产、反映本厂生产”、“达到及时配合生产之目的”。他们不了解那些反映国家建设和人民斗争各方面情况的文艺节目和具有健康的娱乐性的节目，是能够提高工人的觉悟和解除工人的疲劳，因而也能够鼓舞工人的生产热情的。由于机械地、生硬地要求每一个节目都要结合当时当地的中心任务，甚至不结合本厂本车间生产的不让活动；使活动的内容有了很大的局限性。北京有一个厂的工人自己编了这样一些话剧：供销车间有“推销呆滞料”，烧成车间有“烘干炉”，包装车间有“包装机”。更有一个工厂在进行查定工作的时候，工会要求工人写出关于查定的剧本。这样，便不可能不出现许多枯燥乏味的东西，有的根本不可能编得出。即使编出，内容也不像一个戏。无怪工人们不满意地说：“早上听工会主席大报告，晚上看戏还是大报告。”
    这种做法，也会影响活动开展的经常性。北京某厂的曲艺组反映：“党委指示我们的曲艺活动要赶上运动，作好宣传。运动一来，我们赶着编，编完了，赶着?，等?完了也就过景了。”他们曾编过两千三百多篇演唱词，但大都是配合中心任务或政治宣传的，演出一、两次之后，再演就没有人要听了。运动过去，没有材料，活动也就消沉了。
    文艺应该服务于政治，服务于生产，这是毫无疑义的。同样的，职工业余艺术活动也是应该服从于这一总的任务。为了推动当前的工作，运用一些如曲艺、美术等适当的形式进行宣传鼓动，是完全必要的，也是群众比较容易接受的。但不能把这种艺术形式的宣传鼓动，作为职工业余艺术活动的全部内容。要求一切艺术活动都来介绍各项生产技术的操作过程，实际上是否认文艺的特性，把文艺的作用混同于生产技术图解等的作用了。职工业余艺术活动不只是配合中心任务，配合生产；它主要的任务还在于树立职工的社会主义劳动态度，培养他们的共产主义道德品质。因此，一方面，要采用反映新生活、描写新人物的广阔的题材，使职工群众受到多方面的教育；另一方面，也要注意到它的正当的娱乐的性质。我国的丰富多样的民间音乐舞蹈艺术，多年来就为广大的劳动群众所掌握。北京石景山钢铁厂运输部车间去年春节时，为了使大部分外地工人不致因思念家乡影响工作，发动职工展开业余艺术活动。这次就发现了职工中会相声、大鼓、推小车等各种各样艺术形式的能手。
    开展职工群众的业余艺术活动，还需要防止它脱离政治、影响生产的偏向。造成脱离政治、影响生产的偏向，往往是由于该单位的领导忽视这一活动，并采取了不闻不问的态度。上海有一个国营工厂党委会宣传部长就曾说过：“我就认为文娱活动不过是蹦蹦跳跳，没有什么政治意义。”这样的看法，就会让职工业余艺术活动陷入自流状态。不少城市的工厂曾经花钱到厂外聘请未经思想改造的民间职业艺人到厂内教戏、教魔术和杂技，因而将优美健康的民间舞蹈表演成黄色舞，甚至演出形象恶劣、侮辱劳动妇女等等的戏曲节目，和吞火棒、咬电灯泡等恐怖野蛮的杂技。有的单位的积极分子从少数人的偏爱出发，铺张浪费，还经常到厂外演出。这些情况不但严重地毒害了工人的思想意识，还破坏了劳动纪律，影响生产。只有当厂、矿、工地、企业的领导干部，明确了解了这一活动的方针和做法，重视并积极地领导了这一活动的时候，职工群众艺术活动才能得到正常的开展。
    职工业余艺术活动的方式方法，应该掌握业余和自愿的原则。因为职工群众的主要任务是生产。开展职工群众的艺术活动是为了满足他们生产之余的文化生活需要，所以这一活动必须在业余的时间进行。北京人民印刷厂的领导将工人生产以外业余的学习、开会等活动时间作了统一的和妥善的安排，让职工们每天都有一定的文娱活动时间，这就使该厂开展业余艺术活动得到有力的保证；并使职工认识到合理地支配业余时间，和进行适当的文化娱乐，对生产是更有利的。但有的单位为了配合中心任务，经常抽调一些积极分子脱离生产搞活动，也是不符合业余艺术活动原则的。有的单位在开展活动时，不照顾到每个人不同的爱好，采取生硬的做法，甚至勉强怀孕的女工参加动作激烈的集体舞，就违反了自愿的原则。职工业余艺术活动的群众性，并不是要求把所有的人都组织到某一活动中来，而是尽可能将大家吸引到他们自己爱好的各种各样活动中去。
       职工群众的艺术活动，要在现有的基础上得到巩固和向前推进一步，不仅要明确它的方针任务，还需要不断地提高职工艺术活动的水平。“普及工作若是永远停止在一个水平上，一月两月三月，一年两年三年，总是一样的货色，一样的‘小放牛’，一样的‘人、手、口、刀、牛、羊’，那末，教育者与被教育者岂不都是半斤八两？这种普及工作还有什么意义呢？人民要求普及，跟着也就要求提高，要求逐年逐月地提高。”（毛泽东：“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”）几年以来，很多文艺工作者在毛泽东同志为工农兵服务的文艺方针的指示下，都曾热情地到厂矿体验生活或辅导职工的各种业余艺术活动，使活动的开展得到不少帮助。但由于各地文化部门和工会对专业文艺工作者辅导职工群众的业余艺术活动，缺乏统一的有计划的组织工作，和专业文艺团体对辅导工作缺乏计划性，以致长时期陷入自流状态。下厂辅导的各个单位往往各有各的任务，不从工厂的实际需要出发，哪个厂里出现一些突出的人物和较大的创造发明，大家就一窝蜂地赶去了。例如北京琉璃河水泥厂在一九五二年一年中曾有过六十六个辅导干部；九月一个月便有七个单位共四十多人同时住在厂里；到了一九五三年，该厂业余艺术活动搞不起来的时候，反而变得冷冷清清，谁也不去了。缺乏统一的组织和计划，还表现在辅导单位和被辅导单位的要求不一致，甚至互相不满意。
    辅导工作本身也还存在着一些缺点。有一个音乐工作者曾要求一个工厂新成立的军乐队的工人在
  一个月内掌握好五线谱。还说：“非会五线谱不可，不会就不能学乐器。”这种不从职工业余艺术活动现有水平出发的教学方法自然不可能收到很好的效果。有一些辅导干部下厂以后，急于求成，没有很好地注意培养活动中的骨干，自己包办代替；结果形成辅导干部来时热热闹闹，辅导干部走后就垮台。这种情况有时也由于有的基层工会没有很好的协助辅导干部进行工作，介绍一下情况后就一推不管。辅导工作做得不够好的另一个原因，则是那些专业团体的领导，对本单位出去做辅导工作的干部的工作没有深入地检查和帮助。于是像织布厂就有
  “五一织布法舞”，烟厂有“包烟舞”，甚至医院有“无痛分娩法舞”，为了推广黄润萍的仓库管理法，还产生了“黄润萍舞”等表现生产技术的操作过程和机器动作的舞蹈、戏剧，这也是和某些专业文艺工作者错误的文艺思想的影响有关的。最近，由于各地文工团整编和实行企业化，对于职工业余艺术活动的辅导工作，有的单位实际上已经陷于停顿状态了。
    北京市文化事业管理处和北京市总工会，今年曾组织和帮助首都的专业文艺团体，分别和一些厂矿建立联系或订立合同，长期固定地进行辅导，这种办法可供各地文化部门、工会组织和专业文艺团体参考。北京市文化事业管理处举办的北京业余艺术学校，几年来培养职工群众业余艺术活动骨干分子的经验，也同样值得各地有关部门参考。有条件的城市，在不影响生产的情况下，举办当地厂矿、工地、企业工人文艺观摩会演或竞赛等，也是提高职工群众艺术水平的有效方法。
    演唱材料的供应对于职工业余艺术活动的正常开展，活动的经常性也是非常重要的。目前，许多厂矿在活动中产生的许多描写生产技术的操作过程等枯燥乏味的东西，一方面固然由于那些单位的领导强调“结合本厂生产、反映本厂生产”或要求“达到及时配合生产之目的”；另一方面也是因为专业文艺工作者还不能满足职工群众的需要。“辅导群众的业余艺术活动，是省、市文联的另一个主要的任务。这种辅导应当侧重于供应群众业余艺术活动的材料和指导群众的创作这两方面……地方的文艺刊物应当成为发现和培养当地青年作家，供给群众通俗文艺读物，供给群众业余艺术演唱材料的有效的工具。”（周扬：“为创造更多的优秀的文学艺术作品而奋斗”）如果省、市文联和地方文艺刊物能够认真担负起这一责任，职工群众的业余艺术活动将会更健康、更蓬勃地开展起来。
