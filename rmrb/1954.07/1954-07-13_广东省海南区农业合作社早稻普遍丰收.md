Agricultural cooperatives in Hainan District, Guangdong Province, which were established this spring, have achieved universal early rice harvests. According to reports from twenty cooperatives that have completed the summer harvest, two cooperatives have more than doubled their yields; nine cooperatives have increased yields by 50% to 90%; and the rest have generally increased yields by 10% to 50%.

The increased early rice yields of these agricultural production cooperatives have proven that the implementation of agricultural production technology reforms on the basis of collectivization can greatly unleash production potential. This year, the cooperatives universally implemented three plowings and three harrowings, weeding two to three times, and applying five to ten dan of fertilizer per mu. The Ru'chuan Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in Qiongshan County, due to the implementation of deep plowing, meticulous cultivation, and rational fertilization, increased its average early rice yield by 90 jin per mu compared to last year. The cooperatives also vigorously built water conservancy projects and improved soil quality. Seven cooperatives in Qiongshan, Qiongdong, and Chengmai counties converted 97.4 mu of single-cropping land into double-cropping land after building water conservancy projects, increasing rice production by more than 18,000 jin. Liu Zhenmao, deputy director of the Dacui Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in Chengmai County, had a piece of red soil land that was sticky and hard, making it difficult to deeply plow and cultivate, and in previous years only yielded 150 jin of grain. This year, after the land was entered into the cooperative, the cooperative organized twenty-two laborers to dig 96 dan of pond mud to put into the field, improving the soil quality, and also implemented deep plowing, meticulous cultivation, and intensive fertilization. As a result, this crop harvested 400 jin of grain, an increase of 1.66 times compared to last year. Many cooperatives that tried advanced cultivation techniques such as saltwater seed selection, standardized seedling fields, careful preparation of seedling beds, and close planting of small hills all achieved good results.

During the summer harvest, all cooperatives conducted education for their members by summarizing the experiences of increased production. At the same time, they organized field observation and comparison, promoting mutual aid teams to emulate agricultural production cooperatives. After Qiongdong County organized the leaders of twelve townships' mutual aid teams to visit agricultural production cooperatives and demonstration farms, they promoted saltwater seed selection in 446 mutual aid teams.

    广东省海南区农业合作社早稻普遍丰收
    广东省海南区今春建立的第一批农业生产合作社早稻普遍丰收。根据已完成夏收的二十个社的报告，增产一倍以上有两个社；增产五成至九成的有九个社；其余一般也增产一成至五成。
    这些农业生产合作社的早稻增产已经证明了在合作化的基础上实行农业生产技术改革就能大大地发挥生产的潜力。各社的早造田今年普遍做到了三犁三耙，除草两次至三次，每亩施肥五担至十担。琼山县儒传村农业生产合作社由于实行深耕细作、合理施肥，早稻平均每亩比去年增产九十斤。各社又大力兴修了水利，改良了土质。琼山、琼东、澄迈三县七个社兴修了水利后，将九十七亩四分单造田改为双造田，共增产稻谷一万八千多斤。澄迈县大催村农业生产合作社副主任刘祯茂有一块红土田，土质粘硬，很难深耕细作，往年只收一百五十斤谷。今年土地入社后，社里组织了二十二个劳动力，挖了九十六担塘泥下田，改良了土质，又实行了深耕细作，加工施肥，结果这一造收获了四百斤谷，比去年增产一点六六倍。不少社试行盐水选种、合式秧田、细整秧地、小科密植等先进的耕作技术，都获得了良好的效果。
    在夏收中，各社都通过总结增产经验，对社员进行了一次教育。同时组织田间观摩评比，推动互助组向农业生产合作社看齐。琼东县组织了十二个乡的互助组长到农业生产合作社和示范农场参观后，推动了四百四十六个互助组进行盐水选种。
