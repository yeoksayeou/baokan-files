Liaoxi and Jilin Provincial People's Courts Sentence a Robbery and Bandit Group Case
    Bandit Leaders Li Haiquan, Sun Zhengwu and Six Others Sentenced to Death
    The Public Security Bureaus of Lishu and Shuangliao Counties in Liaoxi Province, and Huaide and Changling Counties in Jilin Province, under the unified command of the Provincial Public Security Departments, cracked an organized robbery and theft case in mid-March of this year, arresting twenty-nine principal and accessory criminals including Li Haiquan and Sun Zhengwu. Dozens of stolen and robbed draught animals were recovered, and various guns and ammunition were seized. After thorough interrogation, the Liaoxi and Jilin Provincial People's Courts have rendered verdicts in the case.
  This bandit group was composed of escaped counter-revolutionaries, illegal landlords, habitual bandits, habitual thieves, and unemployed ruffians. Since 1948, these bandits have been active in nineteen counties and banners including Lishu, Shuangliao, Changbei, and Changling, recklessly robbing and stealing the livestock and property of the masses and cooperatives, committing a total of ninety-five cases, seriously endangering social order, damaging the interests of the people, and hindering the country's construction. In 1953, they even murdered several people. The bandits relied on reactionary landlords and rich peasants as informers, frequently stealing livestock licenses and certificates, and often changing their names, falsely registering, and forging seals to facilitate their criminal activities. The bandits also impersonated our public security personnel, carrying out robberies under the pretext of night patrols. During the vigorous suppression of counter-revolutionaries, they fled and hid everywhere, but continued to commit crimes after the movement subsided.
    After the case was cracked, repeated interrogations and investigations revealed that the principal and accessory criminals had confessed to their crimes. The Liaoxi and Jilin Provincial Public Security Departments respectively filed public prosecutions with the Liaoxi and Jilin Provincial People's Courts. The People's Courts of the two provinces, based on the severity of their crimes, sentenced the ringleaders Li Haiquan, Sun Zhengwu, Liu Fenghe and six other criminals to death. Other criminals were sentenced to life imprisonment and fixed-term imprisonment, respectively. Three others whose crimes were relatively minor and who were able to confess frankly were released. The sentences were carried out after public trials were held in Lishu and Huaide counties, respectively.

    辽西吉林两省人民法院判决一起盗匪集团案
    匪首李海泉、孙正武等六名被判处死刑
    辽西省梨树、双辽和吉林省怀德、长岭等县公安局，在两省公安厅的统一指挥下，在今年三月中旬破获了一起有组织的抢劫、盗窃案件，捕获主从各犯李海泉、孙正武等二十九名，查获被盗被劫的耕畜数十匹，并缴获枪支、子弹等各一部。经过周密的审讯后，辽西、吉林两省人民法院已将此案作了判决。
  这个盗匪集团是由漏网的反革命分子、不法地主、惯匪、惯盗和无业流氓等组成的。从一九四八年起，这批匪徒就活动在梨树、双辽、昌北、长岭、等十九个县、旗，大肆抢劫、盗窃群众的和合作社的牲畜财物，共作案九十五起，严重地危害了社会治安，损害了人民群众的利益，妨害了国家的建设事业。一九五三年中，他们还害死了群众数人。匪徒们依靠反动的地主、富农作耳目，经常盗窃牲畜执照、证件，并经常更名换姓，假报名号，伪造印信，以便利他们的犯罪活动。匪徒们还曾冒充我公安人员，以查夜为名进行抢劫。在大张旗鼓镇压反革命时，他们到处逃亡隐匿，但在运动过后又继续为非作恶。
    这一案件破获后经过反复审讯查证，主从各犯均已供认他们的犯罪行为，辽西、吉林两省公安厅分别向辽西、吉林两省人民法院提起公诉。两省的人民法院已根据他们犯罪情节的轻重，判处首犯李海泉、孙正武、刘凤和等六犯死刑，其他各犯被分别判处无期徒刑和有期徒刑，另有三犯罪行较轻，尚能坦白供认，予以释放。这一判决，已在梨树、怀德两县分别召开的公审大会后执行。
