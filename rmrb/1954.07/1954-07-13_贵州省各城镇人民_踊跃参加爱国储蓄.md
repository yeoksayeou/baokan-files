    People in Various Towns and Cities in Guizhou Province
    Actively Participate in Patriotic Savings
    People in various towns and cities in Guizhou Province are actively depositing their idle funds into the People's Bank of China. By the end of June, the money saved in the People's Bank of China by workers, cadres, soldiers, students, and residents in various towns and cities across the province had increased from 47.2 billion yuan in November of last year to 54 billion yuan. According to statistics from thirteen locations including Guiyang, Zunyi, Anshun, Tongren, and Duyun, as of the end of May, a total of 100,280 households had participated in savings. 90% of the personnel in the Grain Bureau of the Chishui County People's Government participated in savings; over 80% of the soldiers in Huangping County participated in savings; and in one residential group in Guizhuqiao, Guiyang City, 25 out of 38 households participated in savings. Some staff members of the state-owned Guiyang Mining Machinery Factory, the Guiyang Municipal People's Government Taxation Bureau, and other units usually deposit their surplus money in the bank, and as a result, they have acquired items such as bicycles, fountain pens, and watches. Many road construction workers in Longli County who participated in savings said: Participating in savings can accumulate construction funds for the country and reduce waste. It is really killing two birds with one stone.
    In order to encourage the broad masses of people in towns and cities to actively participate in savings, the People's Banks in various parts of Guizhou Province regularly publicize the significance of saving and the relevant savings regulations and methods to the masses. The starting point for deposits is set very low. Some People's Banks have also organized mobile service teams and implemented a shift work system to facilitate deposits and withdrawals for savers.

    贵州省各城镇人民
    踊跃参加爱国储蓄
    贵州省各城镇人民踊跃把闲散资金存入人民银行。到六月底，全省各城镇职工、干部、战士、学生、居民在人民银行储蓄的钱已从去年十一月份的四百七十二亿元上升到五百四十亿元。据贵阳、遵义、安顺、铜仁、都匀等十三地的统计，截至五月底止，参加储蓄的共有十万零二千八百多户。赤水县人民政府粮食局百分之九十的人员参加了储蓄；黄平县部队战士参加储蓄的在百分之八十以上；贵阳市贯珠桥一个居民小组的三十八户居民中，有二十五户参加储蓄。国营贵阳矿山机器厂、贵阳市人民政府税务局等单位的一些工作人员，平时有了余钱就在银行储蓄起来，结果添置了自行车、钢笔、手表等物品。龙里县许多参加储蓄的筑路工人说：参加储蓄，可以为国家积累建设资金，又可以减少浪费，实在是一举两得的事情。
    为了鼓励广大城镇人民踊跃参加储蓄，贵州省各地人民银行经常向群众宣传节约储蓄的意义和有关储蓄的章程、办法。存款起点规定得很低。有些人民银行还组织流动服务组，实行连带上班制，以便储户存款和取款。
