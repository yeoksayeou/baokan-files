State-owned mines under the East China Coal Mining Administration
    Can Overproduce More Than 300,000 Tons of Coal in the First Half of the Year
    Northwest Coal Mines' Total Raw Coal Production Exceeds Half of the Annual Plan
    The state-owned coal mines (excluding small mines) under the East China Coal Mining Administration had already overfulfilled the state production plan for the first half of the year by fifteen days as of June 15th. It is estimated that by the end of June, state-owned coal mines in the entire region will have overproduced more than 300,000 tons of raw coal in the first half of the year, an increase of approximately 26% compared to the same period last year. The production cost in the first half of the year decreased by an average of 9.28% compared to the planned cost, and it is estimated that over 34 billion yuan will be saved for the state in the first half of the year. Due to increased production, reduced production costs, and savings in other expenses, state-owned coal mines in the entire region have also achieved excellent results in realizing enterprise profits in the first half of the year.
    This year, the coal produced by state-owned coal mines in East China will not only supply industrial production and civilian use in the East China region but also support important factories and mines in Hubei, Jiangxi, and Henan provinces. Approximately four hundred industrial production units and transportation units signed annual coal consumption contracts with state-owned coal mines in East China this spring. The overfulfillment of the production plan for the first half of the year by various mines has powerfully guaranteed the supply of coal to these departments. The ash content and gangue content of the coal produced by various mines this year generally meet the state planned targets, thereby also ensuring the quality of coal for industrial use.

    Northwest China's state-owned coal mines have completed the state production plan for the first half of the year ahead of schedule. Tongchuan Coal Mine completed it nineteen days ahead of schedule, and the Aganzhen and Shmengou coal mines of the Gansu Mining Bureau completed it thirteen days ahead of schedule. As of June 20th, the total raw coal production of state-owned coal mines in Northwest China has reached 56% of the annual state plan.
    The completion of the plan by state-owned coal mines in Northwest China this year is better than last year. From January to May, Tongchuan Coal Mine overfulfilled the coal production task every month; the average daily output in the first quarter increased by nearly 4% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. After studying the general line, the enthusiasm for production among the workers in various coal mines has generally increased, and the attendance rate during the Spring Festival was also normal. Since April, various coal mines have also strengthened tunneling work. Tongchuan Coal Mine established a tunneling work area and a rapid tunneling team, and the tunneling footage in May increased by 13.9% compared to April. Before the arrival of summer, all mines conducted safety inspections, repaired mechanical and electrical equipment, and renovated ventilation roadways, which were also important reasons for ensuring the smooth progress of production. At present, the staff and workers of various coal mines are stepping up preparations for production in the second half of the year, further strengthening planned management, and carrying out technical innovation movements, striving to overfulfill the annual state production plan.

    华东区煤矿管理局所属国营各矿
    上半年可超额产煤三十多万吨
    西北区煤矿原煤总产量超过全年计划一半
    华东煤矿管理局所属各国营煤矿（不包括小矿）已在六月十五日提前十五天超额完成了上半年的国家生产计划。预计到六月底，全区国营煤矿上半年将超额生产三十多万吨原煤，比去年同期约提高百分之二十六左右。上半年的生产成本比计划成本平均降低了百分之九点二八，预计上半年可为国家节约三百四十亿余元。由于产量增加，生产成本降低以及节约其他开支等原因，上半年全区国营煤矿在实现企业利润方面，也有了很好的成绩。
    今年华东区各国营煤矿所产的煤除供应华东地区工业生产和民用外，还要支援湖北、江西、河南等省的重要厂矿。今年春季和华东各国营煤矿签订年度用煤合同的，约有四百个工业生产单位和交通运输单位。各矿超额完成上半年生产计划，就有力地保证了对这些部门用煤的供应。今年各矿生产的煤所含的灰分和含矸率，一般都达到国家计划指标，从而也保证了工业用煤的质量。

    西北区国营煤矿已提前完成上半年国家生产计划。铜川煤矿提前十九天完成，甘肃矿务局阿干镇、石门沟等煤矿提前十三天完成。截至六月二十日止，西北各国营煤矿原煤总生产量已达全年国家计划的百分之五十六。
    今年西北各国营煤矿完成计划的情况比去年好。铜川煤矿从一月到五月份，月月超额完成产煤任务；第一季度平均日产量比去年第四季度增加近百分之四。各煤矿工人经过总路线学习后，生产积极性普遍提高，春节前后出勤率也很正常。四月以来，各煤矿并加强了掘进工作。铜川煤矿成立了掘进工区和快速掘进队，五月份掘进进尺就比四月份提高百分之十三点九。在夏季来临以前，各矿都进行了安全检查，检修机电设备和整修通风巷道等，也是保证生产顺利进行的重要原因。现在，各煤矿职工正加紧进行下半年生产准备工作，进一步加强计划管理和开展技术革新运动，争取超额完成全年的国家生产计划。（新华社）
