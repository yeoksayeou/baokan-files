    Shanghai Diesel Engine Plant, Wuxi Diesel Engine Plant, Jinan Diesel Engine Plant and other factories' workers are actively modifying and designing a large number of marine diesel engines for coastal fishermen. China's coastal fish production is abundant, and fishermen have also gradually organized, but the old methods of using wooden sailboats for fishing are limited by natural conditions, affecting production and the safety of fishermen. Marine diesel engines will turn sailboats into motorized boats. Motorized fishing boats have a strong fishing capacity and save labor; they can also quickly avoid storms. To adapt to the characteristics of different geographical environments, the above-mentioned factories will manufacture 40-horsepower, 60-horsepower, 80-horsepower, and 120-horsepower marine diesel engines to supply fishermen in the East China and Central South coastal areas. Xinzhong Power Machinery Plant will also manufacture 250-horsepower marine diesel engines to meet the needs of large fishing vessels. Currently, the workers of Shanghai Diesel Engine Plant are modifying ordinary diesel engines, adding reversing gear and transmission equipment.

    上海济南等柴油机厂帮助渔民
    改装和设计大批船用柴油机
    上海柴油机厂、无锡柴油机厂、济南柴油机厂等厂的职工，正积极为沿海渔民改装和设计大批船用柴油机。我国沿海鱼产丰富，渔民也都逐渐组织起来，但老办法用木帆船捕鱼，受自然条件限制，影响产量和渔民安全。船用柴油机将使帆船变为机动船。机动渔船捕鱼能力强，劳动力也节省；遇到风暴能迅速躲避。为适应地理环境不同的特点，上述工厂将制造四十匹、六十匹、八十匹和一百二十匹马力的船用柴油机，供应华东和中南沿海渔民。新中动力机厂并将制造二百五十匹马力船用柴油机供应大渔轮的需要。目前，上海柴油机厂职工正在把普通柴油机进行改装，增加倒顺车和变速设备。
