Xinhua News Agency, 21st dispatch: It has been learned here that the Chiang Kai-shek remnant traitorous clique, under the instigation and assistance of the American authorities, is planning to dispatch five Chiang gang special agents, who had posed as prisoners of war in the American prisoner-of-war camps in Korea and assisted the American side in forcibly detaining prisoners of war, to European countries such as Britain, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Sweden under the guise of a so-called "visiting group" to carry out three months of conspiratorial activities. The United States' instigation of its running dog, Chiang Kai-shek, to carry out this sinister action is a manifestation of the United States' consistent policy of antagonizing the Chinese people. It attempts to slander the People's Republic of China, sow discord between the Chinese and European peoples, and conceal the towering crime of the United States in forcibly detaining Korean and Chinese prisoners of war.

The five Chiang gang special agents designated by the Chiang gang are all the principal culprits in the American prisoner-of-war camps in Korea who massacred and persecuted prisoners of war. For example, one of them, Zhang Zunxian, was the "principal" of the American special agent organization "CIE School" in the American-run Jeju Island No. 3 prisoner-of-war camp. In the American prisoner-of-war camp, he unscrupulously directed his henchmen to carry out a reign of terror and conduct illegal "screenings" of prisoners of war, forcing prisoners of war to tattoo, write blood letters, and join reactionary organizations, so that they would not dare to request repatriation. Shortly before the prisoners of war were handed over to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission for custody, he, acting on the orders of the American side, instructed his henchmen to kill all prisoners of war who expressed a desire for repatriation. Later, he disguised himself as a prisoner of war and infiltrated the Dongchang-ri camp under the custody of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, directing special agents to use violence to sabotage the explanation work and prevent prisoners of war from exercising their right to repatriation. He ordered his henchmen to kill Zhang Zilong, a captured volunteer soldier who requested repatriation, by means of cutting open his abdomen, digging out his heart, burning his flesh, and cutting it off.

The sinister action planned by the United States under the instigation of the Chiang gang is part of the entire conspiracy that the United States is stepping up to antagonize the Chinese people. Since the Geneva Conference, the unwavering peaceful policy and powerful force for defending peace of the People's Republic of China have produced a new, great, and profound influence among countries around the world. More and more countries and peoples are demanding the immediate establishment of normal relations with the People's Republic of China and the restoration of normal economic and cultural exchanges. The United States is extremely annoyed by this situation, and is therefore stepping up the deployment of aggressive actions against the People's Republic of China in all aspects, and this so-called "visiting group" activity is one of the clumsy methods used by the US-Chiang clique to cover up their sinister activities and conspiracies against the Chinese people. It is clear that the European people, who firmly advocate maintaining and promoting friendship with the Chinese people, will never allow the United States and its running dog, the Chiang gang, to carry out such sinister activities that antagonize the Chinese people in their countries.

### 美国又一敌视中国人民的罪恶活动  指使蒋匪派遣曾冒充战俘的特务去欧洲“访问”

    美国又一敌视中国人民的罪恶活动
    指使蒋匪派遣曾冒充战俘的特务去欧洲“访问”
    【新华社二十一日讯】据此间获悉，蒋介石残余卖国集团正在美国当局的指使和协助下，策划派遣曾冒充战俘混在朝鲜的美方战俘营内，协助美方用暴力强迫扣留战俘的五名蒋匪特务，以所谓“访问团”的名义到英国、法国、意大利、荷兰、比利时、瑞典等欧洲国家去，进行三个月的阴谋活动。美国指使它的走狗蒋介石进行这个罪恶行动，是美国一贯敌视中国人民的政策的一种表现，它企图以此来诽谤中华人民共和国，挑拨中国人民和欧洲人民的友谊，并掩饰美国强迫扣留朝中战俘的滔天罪行。
    蒋匪指派的这五名蒋匪特务都是在朝鲜的美方战俘营内屠杀和迫害战俘的首恶罪犯。例如，其中之一的张遵贤就是美方济州岛第三号战俘营里的美方特务机构“CIE学校”的“校长”。他在美方战俘营内曾肆无忌惮地指挥他的喽罗对战俘施行恐怖统治和进行非法“甄别”，强迫战俘刺字、写血书和参加反动组织，使之不敢要求遣返回家。在战俘被移交给中立国遣返委员会看管之前不久，他曾奉美方的命令，指示他的喽罗杀害所有流露出遣返愿望的战俘。后来，他又冒充战俘混入中立国遣返委员会看管下的东场里营场，指挥特务用暴力破坏解释工作和阻止战俘行使遣返权利。他曾命令他的喽罗用剖腹挖心、火烧割肉的手段杀害要求遣返的志愿军被俘人员张子龙。
    美国指使蒋匪策划的这种罪恶行动，是美国正在加紧进行的和中国人民为敌的整个阴谋的一部分。自日内瓦会议召开以后，中华人民共和国的坚定不移地执行的和平政策和保卫和平的强大力量，在世界各国中间产生了新的巨大和深刻的影响。越来越多的国家和人民要求立即和中华人民共和国建立正常关系并恢复正常的经济和文化交流。美国对这种情形十分恼怒，因此正在从各方面加紧布置反对中华人民共和国的侵略行动，而这次的所谓
  “访问团”活动就是美蒋企图用来掩护他们的反对中国人民的罪恶活动和阴谋的拙劣办法之一。很显然，坚决主张保持和促进和中国人民的友谊的欧洲人民，是决不会允许美国和它的走狗蒋匪在他们的国家内进行这种敌视中国人民的罪恶活动的。
