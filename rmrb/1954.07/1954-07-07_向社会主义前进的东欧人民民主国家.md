Eastern European People's Democratic Countries Marching Towards Socialism

	More than 4,500 public libraries

	Poland now has more than 4,500 public libraries (compared to just over a thousand before liberation); in rural areas, there are about 3,000 township libraries and 33,000 library branches; in addition, there are about 5,300 trade union libraries in industrial enterprises and construction sites. At the end of 1953, public libraries had a total collection of more than 18 million books. In 1953, Poland published 90 million books and pamphlets, three times the pre-war level. The daily circulation of newspapers increased from 900,000 copies in 1938 to 4.9 million copies in 1953.

	Holding lectures on cultural and scientific knowledge

	In 1953, the Romanian Association for the Popularization of Cultural and Scientific Knowledge held more than 120,000 lectures in enterprises, clubhouses of government institutions, and village cultural centers, with an audience of 12 million people. The association also published more than 170 kinds of pamphlets in Romanian and various minority languages to promote cultural and scientific knowledge, with a circulation of more than 3 million copies. This year, according to the decision of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party, the main task for the future is to improve agricultural propaganda and disseminate advanced experiences in agricultural production from the Soviet Union and Romania.

	Rapid increase in the number of secondary and university students

	Hungary's secondary and higher education has developed significantly after liberation, and the proportion of students from worker and peasant backgrounds has increased rapidly. At present, there are nearly 50,000 students in Hungarian universities, five times more than before liberation. There are nearly 130,000 secondary school students, two and a half times more than before liberation. Sixty-seven percent of secondary school students and fifty-five percent of university students are from worker and peasant backgrounds.

	More than 600,000 people learn to read and write

	Since the establishment of the people's government, more than 667,000 people aged 14 to 50 in Bulgaria have learned to read and write. Before the war, Bulgaria had only five universities; now it has increased to twenty, and the number of students has more than doubled. In 1953, the daily circulation of Bulgarian newspapers reached 975,000 copies, an increase of 150,000 copies compared to 1952. The daily newspaper circulation in the first quarter of this year has further increased compared to last year. The sales volume of newspapers in rural areas accounted for only 10 to 15 percent of the total newspaper circulation three or four years ago, but now it has increased to more than 40 percent. The number of books published in 1952 was three and a half times that of 1939.

	Civil aviation serves farmers and fishermen

	In recent years, Bulgarian civil aviation has played a considerable role in helping agriculture with pest control and fertilization. This year, the Central Agricultural Aviation Bureau has received many requests from farmers for assistance. For example, farmers in the Pleven region have requested aircraft to help them fertilize 10,000 hectares (15 mu per hectare) of grain fields and 2,000 hectares of sugar beet fields. In order to serve the farmers well, the aircraft pilots are working hard to learn the rich experience of Soviet agricultural aviation under the direct guidance of Soviet experts. In addition, Bulgarian civil aviation also serves fishermen. Airplanes equipped with special devices help fishermen find fish schools in the Black Sea.

	Rationalization and innovation proposals increase year by year

	The rationalization and innovation proposals put forward by the Albanian working people are increasing year by year. In the first year of the Five-Year Plan (1951-1955), a total of 95 rationalization and innovation proposals put forward by the working people were approved and adopted; in 1953, there were 585. Last year's rationalization and innovation proposals can save the country more than 41.71 million riks (Albanian currency) annually. In the first four months of this year, the working people have put forward 380 proposals, of which 123 have been adopted.

	The savings of the working people continue to increase

	The savings of the Albanian working people continue to increase. At the end of 1950, the total amount of money deposited by the people in the National Bank was more than 38.7 million riks; by the end of 1952, it had exceeded 107 million riks. At the end of last year, it increased to more than 138 million riks; in the first quarter of this year, it further increased to more than 159 million riks.

	High-rise buildings are being built

	By the end of 1955, three large buildings will be built on Wenceslas Square, the commercial center of Prague, the capital of Czechoslovakia. One is a five- or six-story hotel. It will have more than 120 rooms equipped with various modern facilities. Each floor will have a reception room and a kitchen. The ground floor will have breakfast rooms, coffee rooms, bars, and restaurants, each capable of accommodating 100 to 200 people. Another is a five- or six-story company specializing in the sale of first-class textiles, clothing, and boots and shoes. The latest styles of clothing will be displayed in the windows, and the walls will be decorated with various paintings and sculptures. The third building is a large restaurant.

    四千五百多个公共图书馆
    波兰全国现在有四千五百多个公共图书馆（解放前只有一千多个）；在农村地区约有三千个乡图书馆和三万三千个图书馆分馆；另外在工业企业和建筑工地还有约五千三百个工会图书馆。公共图书馆在一九五三年年底共藏书一千八百多万册。一九五三年波兰出版的书籍和小册子达九千万册，为战前水平的三倍。报纸每天的发行额从一九三八年的九十万份增加到一九五三年的四百九十万份。
    举办文化与科学知识讲座
    一九五三年罗马尼亚文化与科学知识普及协会在各企业、机关的俱乐部和乡村文化馆中举办了十二万次以上的讲座，听众达一千二百万人。协会还出版了一百七十多种宣传文化与科学知识的罗马尼亚文和各少数民族文字的小册子，印行册数超过了三百万册。今年，协会根据罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会的决定，确定今后的主要任务是：改进农业宣传工作，传播苏联和本国农业生产中的先进经验。
    大、中学生人数迅速增加
    匈牙利中等和高等教育在解放后有了显著的发展，学生中工农出身的比例迅速增加。目前匈牙利高等学校的学生将近五万人，增为解放前的五倍。中学生将近有十三万人，增为解放前的两倍半。有百分之六十七的中学生和百分之五十五的大学生是工农出身。
    六十多万人学会读书写字

    民用航空为农民、渔民服务
    保加利亚民用航空几年来在帮助农业除虫和施肥方面起着相当大的作用。今年中央农业航空局已收到许多农民希望给予帮助的请求书。例如普勒文地区的农民曾请求派飞机帮助他们在一万公顷（每公顷合十五市亩）谷田和二千公顷甜菜地上施肥。为了很好地为农民服务，飞机驾驶员们在苏联专家的直接帮助下，努力学习着苏联农业航空的丰富经验。此外，保加利亚民用航空还为渔民服务。备有特别装置的飞机帮助渔民在黑海寻找鱼群。
    合理化和革新建议年年增加
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动人民提出的合理化和革新建议年年增加。在五年计划（一九五一—一九五五年）的第一年中，劳动人民提出的合理化和革新建议经批准采用的共有九十五件；一九五三年有五百八十五件。去年的合理化和革新建议可以使国家每年节省四千一百七十一万多里克（阿币名）。在今年头四个月里，劳动人民提出的建议已有三百八十件，其中有一百二十三件已经被采用了。
    劳动人民的储蓄不断增加
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动人民的储蓄不断增加。一九五○年底全国人民存入国家银行的款项为三千八百七十多万里克，到一九五二年底已超过了一亿零七百多万里克。去年年底增加到一亿三千八百多万里克；今年第一季度更增加到一亿五千九百多万里克。
    一座座高楼大厦建立起来
