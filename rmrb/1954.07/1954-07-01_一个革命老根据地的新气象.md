Xinhua News Agency:

    Wanfu Township, Haifeng County, Guangdong Province, an old revolutionary base area that suffered severely from the Kuomintang reactionaries, has shown a thriving scene after several years of restoration and construction since liberation.
    As early as before 1927, the people of Wanfu Township, under the influence of the revolutionary martyr Peng Pai, actively participated in and supported the revolutionary struggle. During the Second Domestic Revolutionary War, Wanfu Township was the rear of the Fourth Division of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army. In those years, the township had a population of over 5,000. After the Red Army's Long March, due to the Kuomintang reactionaries' cruel burning and killing, the township's population had dwindled to less than 1,800 by the time of liberation, a decrease of more than 64 percent.
    In the several years since liberation, the People's Government has been very concerned about the production and life of the people in the old revolutionary base areas, and has allocated large sums of relief funds every year to help them restore and develop production and rebuild their homes. Under the care and leadership of the People's Government, the people of the township have carried out a series of production and construction tasks, organized more than 50 mutual aid teams, solved the difficulty of labor shortage, reopened more than 1,000 mu of wasteland, and vigorously built water conservancy projects. Last year, the average yield per mu of late rice in this township generally increased by 40 to 50 percent compared with before liberation, and more than 1,500 dan of surplus grain were sold to the state. In addition, more than 50 new houses have been built in the township, and all the houses destroyed before liberation have been generally repaired. The situation of many farmers who "had no mosquito nets in summer and no cotton quilts in winter" for many years has been completely changed.
    Due to the gradual development of production and the continuous improvement of living standards, the population of this township has been increasing year by year since liberation. At present, there are 521 households and 2,076 people in the township, including 254 children under the age of four. The cultural life of the people in the township is also gradually improving. In 1952 and 1953, the People's Government successively allocated large amounts of education funds to establish and add schools. At present, in addition to a primary school and two branch schools, most villages in the township have also opened farmers' night schools.

    一个革命老根据地的新气象
    曾遭受国民党反动派严重摧残的广东省革命老根据地海丰县万福乡，经过解放后几年来的恢复和建设，已出现了一片欣欣向荣的气象。
    早在一九二七年以前，万福乡人民便在革命先烈彭湃的影响下积极参加和支援革命斗争；在第二次国内革命战争时期，万福乡曾是中国工农红军第四师的后方。当年全乡人口在五千多人以上。红军长征后，在国民党反动派的残酷烧杀下，到解放前，全乡人口已不到一千八百人，减少了百分之六十四以上。
    解放后几年来，人民政府非常关怀老根据地人民的生产和生活，每年都拨出大笔救济款来帮助他们恢复发展生产和重建家园。全乡人民在人民政府的关怀和领导下，进行了一系列的生产建设工作，组织了五十多个互助组，解决了劳动力缺乏的困难，还重开了一千多亩荒田和大力兴修水利。去年这个乡的晚稻每亩产量一般都比解放前增加了四成到五成，卖给国家的余粮有一千五百多担。另外，全乡还新建了五十多间新房屋，所有在解放前被毁坏的房屋已经普遍修理过。不少农民多年来“夏无蚊帐，冬无棉被”的状况，已完全改变过来了。
    由于生产的逐步发展和生活的不断改善，解放以来，这个乡的人口逐年增加。现在全乡共有五百二十一户，二千零七十六人，其中四岁以下的儿童共有二百五十四人。全乡人民的文化生活也在逐步提高。一九五二年和一九五三年，人民政府陆续拨付了大宗教育费，创办和增设学校。目前，这个乡除有一所小学和两所分校外，大部分村庄还开设了农民夜校。（新华社）
