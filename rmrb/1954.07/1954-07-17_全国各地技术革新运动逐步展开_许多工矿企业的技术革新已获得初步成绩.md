The technical innovation movement is gradually unfolding in industrial and mining enterprises across the country.

As early as the second half of last year, influenced by the achievements of technical innovation in Anshan Iron and Steel (An'gang), labor competitions across the country initially entered a new stage with technical innovation as the main content. After the opening of the An'gang Technical Innovation Exhibition in Beijing in mid-April this year, and after the All-China Federation of Trade Unions issued the "Decision on Launching a Technical Innovation Movement Nationwide" in late May, the experience of An'gang's technical innovation was further promoted. Representatives from North China, Northwest China, Northeast China, Central South China, Inner Mongolia, Southwest China, and Beijing, Tianjin, and other places who came to Beijing to visit and study were greatly inspired and educated during their visits and studies. After returning, in addition to actively disseminating the information, many people were studying how to apply An'gang's technical innovation experience to their own units and carry out other technical innovations.

In North China, some factories and mines inspected the handling of rationalization proposals from top to bottom and actively cleared up backlog of rationalization proposals. The chief engineer and chairman of the trade union of the Zhangjiakou Mining Machinery Plant spent a week concentrating on handling the long-standing backlog of rationalization proposals within the plant. With the leadership's attention, the confidence and enthusiasm of the workers in innovating technology were encouraged. According to statistics from twelve units in Tangshan City, including Kailuan Coal Mine, Tangshan Steel Plant, and Tangshan Power Plant, workers submitted 2,111 rationalization proposals in the first and middle ten days of May, which was double the number submitted in the entire month of April. The technical innovation movement in some factories is guiding workers to develop from individual research to collective creation.

In East China, provinces and cities such as Shanghai, Anhui, Qingdao, and Xuzhou held industrial labor model conferences or technical innovator representative conferences to mobilize workers to carry out technical innovation movements. The East China Construction Engineering Bureau also held a professional technical innovation representative conference to exchange advanced working methods of different types of work such as carpentry, bricklaying, painting, and rebar tying, and conducted operational demonstrations. Some factories and mines in East China have already achieved results in technical innovation. Workers in the boiler workshop of the Qingdao Sifang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory submitted more than 120 technical innovation proposals in April and May, of which more than 80 have been implemented. Technical innovations at the state-owned Nanjing Bulb Factory have extended the life of fluorescent lamps from the original 2,000 hours to more than 4,000 hours.

In Central South China, the technical innovation movement in Daye Steel Plant has brought many new features to production. In one month during May and June, the technical innovation plans formulated by various production workshops have implemented 28 items; the rationalization proposals put forward by workers around the key to production are also increasing day by day. In some factories and mines in Central South China, the leadership gives strong support and encouragement to workers' technical innovations. The leadership of Pingxiang Coal Mine has made specific regulations on materials, tools, and drafting technology for workers' technical innovations. The leadership of Jiaozuo Mining Bureau commends and promotes successful experiments and promptly explains to the masses those that cannot be realized.

In Northeast China, Wang Chonglun, a technical innovator at Anshan Iron and Steel Company, recently successfully trial-produced a new tool – the "Multi-Live Fixture" – with the support of the tool workshop. In the past, more than a dozen coal transportation systems operated manually at Fushun Longfeng Mine. Due to technical innovation, they are now mechanized. The Qiqihar No. 1 Machine Tool Plant has launched a technical innovation movement centered on solving difficulties in the trial production of new products, ensuring the quality of new products, and shortening the trial production time. Some factories and mines and basic construction sites in Northeast China also paid special attention to promoting the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in the technical innovation movement.

Sichuan, Guizhou, Chongqing, Kunming and other provinces and cities have also convened labor model and advanced producer meetings. Workers in factories such as Chongqing State-owned 101 Steel Plant actively put forward rationalization proposals aimed at key issues in production. Many technical innovation deeds have also recently emerged in various factories in Xi'an, which have played a significant role in breaking through weak links in production. Influenced by An'gang's technical innovations, workers in some factories in Inner Mongolia have worked hard to improve old equipment and increase labor productivity, and have also achieved considerable results.

    全国各地技术革新运动逐步展开
    许多工矿企业的技术革新已获得初步成绩
    技术革新运动正在各地工矿企业中逐渐展开。
    早在去年下半年，在鞍钢技术革新成就的影响下，全国各地的劳动竞赛已初步走上以技术革新为主要内容的新阶段。今年四月中旬鞍钢技术革新展览会在北京开幕，五月下旬，中华全国总工会发布
  “关于在全国范围内开展技术革新运动的决定”以后，鞍钢技术革新的经验就进一步被推广开来。华北、西北、东北、中南、内蒙古、西南等地区，以及北京、天津等地来北京参观和学习的代表在参观和学习中，都得到很大启发和教育。他们回去后，除积极进行传达外，许多人都在研究把鞍钢技术革新的经验运用到本单位，并进行其他的技术革新。
    华北区有些厂矿自上而下地检查了处理合理化建议的工作，积极地清理了积压的合理化建议。张家口矿山机械厂总工程师和工会主席以一个星期时间，集中处理了厂内长期积压的合理化建议。在领导方面的重视下，职工群众革新技术的信心和热情得到了鼓舞。唐山市的开滦煤矿、唐山钢厂、唐山发电厂等十二个单位统计，职工们在五月份上、中两旬就提出了二千一百一十一件合理化建议，比四月份一个月提出的要增加一倍。有些工厂的技术革新运动正在引导职工由单独研究向集体创造方向发展。
    在华东地区，上海、安徽、青岛、徐州等省市都召开了工业劳动模范会议或技术革新者代表会议，动员职工群众开展技术革新运动。华东建筑工程局并举行了专业的技术革新代表会议，交流了木工、瓦工、漆工、扎铁工等不同工种的先进工作法，进行了操作表演。华东各地有的厂矿技术革新已获得成绩。青岛四方机车车辆制造工厂锅炉车间职工在四、五两月提出的一百二十多件技术革新建议，已实现的就有八十多件。国营南京灯泡厂技术革新中使萤光灯寿命由原来的二千小时延长到四千小时以上。
    中南地区，大冶钢厂的技术革新运动，已经给生产上带来了许多新的气象。五六月间的一个月内各生产车间制订的技术革新方案，已经实现了二十八项；职工们围绕着生产关键提出的合理化建议也一天天增多。中南各地某些厂矿领导方面对职工们的技术革新予以大力支持和鼓励。萍乡煤矿领导方面对职工的技术革新，在材料、工具、制图技术等方面，都作了具体的规定。焦作矿务局领导方面对试验成功的就表扬和推广，不能实现的及时向群众解释。
    在东北地区，鞍山钢铁公司的技术革新者王崇伦最近在工具车间的支持下，又试制成功一项新的工具——“多活卡具”。抚顺龙凤矿过去十多处用人工操作的运煤系统，由于技术革新，现在都机械化了。齐齐哈尔第一机床厂以解决试制新产品中的困难为中心开展技术革新运动，保证了新产品的质量，试制的时间也缩短不少。东北地区有些厂矿和基本建设工地在技术革新运动中还特别注意推广苏联的先进经验。
    四川、贵州、重庆、昆明等省市也都召开了劳动模范和先进生产者会议。重庆市国营一零一钢铁厂等工厂的职工，针对生产中的关键问题积极提出合理化建议。西安市各工厂最近也出现许多技术革新的事迹，对突破生产中的薄弱环节起了较大作用。内蒙古地区有些工厂的职工在鞍钢技术革新的影响下，努力改进旧设备，提高劳动生产率，也已获得不少成绩。（新华社）
