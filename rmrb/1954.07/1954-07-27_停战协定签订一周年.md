One Year Since the Signing of the Armistice Agreement
Hong Mingxi, Deputy Premier of the Cabinet of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea

A year has passed since the Korean Armistice was realized.

The achievement of the Korean Armistice is not only a historic victory for the Korean people, but also a victory for the entire peace-loving forces. It has helped ease international tensions, build peace in Asia, and provided the possibility of a peaceful final resolution of the Korean issue.

After the armistice, the new tasks facing the Korean people are to peacefully resolve the Korean issue and quickly restore and develop the national economy severely damaged by the war, so as to stabilize people's lives.

The implementation of such tasks is only possible in the northern half of the Republic. However, in the southern half of our country, the US aggressive troops continue to be stationed and maintain a colonial slave system that can only be sustained by the bayonets of the US military. This situation has led the southern and northern parts of the Republic to take distinctly opposite paths after the armistice.

Based on its peaceful policy, and with the active support of the world's peace-loving forces led by the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has moved the northern half of the Republic from armistice to consolidated peace, and advanced the work of peaceful reunification of our country on a democratic basis. For this purpose, the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has faithfully observed and continues to observe the armistice agreement since its signing. In order to convene a Korean political conference aimed at achieving the task of peaceful reunification of Korea and stipulated in the armistice agreement, the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea put forward its own reasonable plan in the bilateral talks and made efforts to reach an agreement. However, the US delegation rejected the plan put forward by our delegation, unilaterally announced an indefinite adjournment, and finally ruined the convening of the political conference.

After the signing of the armistice agreement, the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea made creative efforts in the peaceful construction work to comprehensively restore our national economy. At the same time, in order to stabilize and improve the people's living standards after the war, it reduced the retail prices of daily necessities and food needed by the people three times, and took measures to guarantee the housing of working people and improve labor supply work, reduced various state burdens on small farmers and disaster-stricken farmers, abolished the state meat purchasing system, and allocated huge loans. In order to improve the material lives of workers, technicians and staff, wages were increased by 25 to 50 percent, and in order to improve the lives of urban and rural residents, the supply of aquatic products was improved and strengthened. In order to protect mothers and infants, the government improved the work of medical institutions, rapidly restored and expanded health and cultural facilities, and popularized them in all aspects.

The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has achieved considerable success in restoring and developing the national economy. In the year after the armistice, many factories, mines and enterprises were restored, and many factories fully started production, railways and bridges were restored, and magnificent cities were rebuilt from the ruins. This achievement is due to the selfless and creative labor of our people, and the great fraternal assistance from the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and various People's Democratic countries. This fraternal assistance marks the enthusiastic mutual assistance and unbreakable friendship in the peaceful democratic camp.

The three-year plan of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for 1954-1956, which was adopted in April, will have a huge effect on effectively carrying out the work of restoring and constructing the post-war national economy and comprehensively developing and improving the living standards of residents. During this period, new enterprises will be built that can produce products that Korean industry could not produce in the past.

The national income of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea will increase by more than 30 percent in 1956 compared with 1949, and by more than 75 percent compared with 1953. In the past year, the initial achievements made by the Korean people in the northern half of the Republic in the work of post-war restoration and construction fully demonstrated the abundant vitality of the people's democratic system established in the northern half of our country, and the material strength of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to strive for the peaceful reunification of the whole country.

However, the situation in the southern half, where the US imperialists have continued to adopt a policy of war preparation in the past year after the armistice, is completely opposite to this. Although the US imperialists were defeated on the Korean battlefield, they still do not abandon their delusion of a "position of strength" policy and attempt to carry out new military adventures in Asia. In the past year, the US side has constantly violated the armistice agreement and is continuing to violate it. The United States, disregarding the agreed-upon terms in the armistice agreement, forcibly detained 48,000 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war and handed them over to the Li Chengwan (Syngman Rhee) bandit gang and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and on August 8 last year, it concluded the "US-ROK Mutual Defense Treaty" with the South Korean puppet government. This treaty guarantees the permanent stationing of US aggressive troops in South Korea, and the United States stipulated that the political conference would have a deadline of three months, after which it would "withdraw from the meeting hall at the same time" with the Li Chengwan representative. The US side seriously violated the armistice agreement, transported a large amount of dismantled parts and components of war materials into the South Korean region, and did everything possible to restrict and obstruct the work of the Polish and Czechoslovakian members in the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and its sub-teams, and even conspired to sabotage the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission itself.

Because, the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission exposed to the people of the world the US's barbaric violation of the armistice agreement and their policy of war preparation in South Korea.

The United States is frantically stepping up the expansion of the puppet army in South Korea, extending the age of conscription and the service years of the army reserve—the so-called militia—from the age of seventeen to thirty to forty, and forcibly incorporating them into the army.

The US imperialists are spreading the atmosphere of war by strengthening the work of the puppet army and instructing the Li Chengwan bandit gang to continue clamoring for "unification by advancing north."

The day after the breakdown of the Geneva Conference discussions on the Korean issue, Puppet Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Bian Rongtai said that South Korea would no longer be bound by the armistice agreement. That day, Li Chengwan said in Seoul, "The only way to unify is to use force."

Due to the US's pursuit of a war-seeking policy in South Korea, the lives of the South Korean people who have suffered from war damage have become even more miserable.

According to public South Korean data, the food industry at the end of 1953 was reduced to one-fifth of the pre-war level; other departments were reduced even more than that.

Due to the reactionary land policy and cruel plundering policy of the US imperialists and the Li Chengwan traitorous bandit gang, South Korea is gradually becoming a severely hungry and cold area. The number of farmers who abandon their land and wander around is increasing day by day. According to the reduced survey bulletin of the Li Chengwan bandit gang, it reached more than 3 million in 1953. The Li Chengwan puppet government, disregarding this situation, still expands the budget deficit and strengthens the plunder of the people for huge military expenditures.

The fiscal deficit in 1953 reached 42.9 billion won (fake currency). In this year's budget of 242.3 billion won, more than 90 percent of the total expenditure is allocated for military expenditures. Sixteen types of taxes have been increased.

On June 30, the total amount of currency issued in South Korea exceeded 31.6 billion won. At the end of December 1953, the retail price index in Seoul soared 77 times compared with April 1947. Now, South Korea has millions of unemployed, war victims, more than 500,000 war orphans, and tens of thousands of so-called "disabled" soldiers, who are deprived of all living opportunities and trapped in the hell of hunger, unemployment, disease, and high prices.

The above is a simple one-year summary of the war policy implemented by the United States in South Korea against the Korean people who long for the peaceful reunification of their motherland.

Today, the Korean people unanimously hope to lift the hostile military state artificially designated in our country, and quickly restore the reunification of our country.

The United States answered the Korean people's urgent desire and the consistent efforts made by the Korean people for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue with "negotiations are useless" and "sabotaging negotiations."

However, the US imperialists' treacherous acts and despicable plans to obstruct the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and continue to maintain international tensions will absolutely not be realized in the face of the powerful world peace forces.

The Berlin Four Foreign Ministers Conference, based on the proposal of Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, removed the difficulties artificially created by the United States in the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and decided to convene the Geneva Conference to discuss the Korean issue.

At the Geneva Conference, based on the principle that the Korean issue should be resolved by the Korean people themselves, our delegation put forward a reasonable and just plan to withdraw all foreign troops from Korea, hold free elections throughout Korea based on the free will of the Korean people, quickly restore the national unity of Korea, and consolidate peace in Korea, and has always strived to reach an agreement.

The Soviet and Chinese delegations fully supported the plan put forward by our delegation, and based on this plan, they put forward their own certain plans and made great efforts to reach an agreement. However, the representatives of the United States and its vassal states, disregarding the interests and national rights of the Korean people, attempted to use the "United Nations," a belligerent party in the Korean War, to "supervise" the election, and to expand the colonial fascist rule established by the United States in South Korea to the northern half of the Republic. It advocated the long-term stationing of US troops in South Korea, but demanded the unilateral withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers. The United States stubbornly adhered to this unreasonable proposition, obstructed and disrupted the discussion of the Korean issue, and made the Korean issue an international issue that remains unresolved, in order to maintain international tensions and frantically prepare for a new war.

The entire process of the Geneva Conference's discussion of the Korean issue clearly exposed who is hindering the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and who is the enemy of the people's national interests and world peace.

From the signing of the armistice agreement to this day, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has consistently made all efforts to achieve the peaceful reunification of the motherland.

Due to the concerted efforts of the Korean people who yearn for the peaceful reunification of their motherland, and the efforts of the Soviet Union and China and the world's peace forces, the Korean armistice was achieved. It opened up a path for any international dispute to be resolved peacefully on the basis of respecting the national interests and rights of the people, and created an example of resolving international disputes through consultation.

The restoration of peace in Indochina is a huge contribution to peace in Asia, and will further ease international tensions. The ceasefire in Indochina once again clearly showed that international disputes can be resolved through consultation. The US imperialists' claim that "negotiations are useless" was shamefully shattered. The Korean armistice agreement signed a year ago and the Indochina ceasefire agreement signed recently have once again confirmed that the US imperialists and their followers are unwilling to accept the lessons in Korea and Indochina, and their stubborn adherence to their arrogant policy of aggression has made them more isolated in the eyes of the people of the world and will inevitably suffer more severe defeats.

The signing of the Indochina agreement has made peace-loving people all over the world more confident that no international issue cannot be resolved through consultation. It has further consolidated the victorious confidence of the peace-loving people in striving to ease international tensions and consolidate world peace.

Recently, the US rulers in Washington and Seoul have continued to prepare for new military adventures against the Korean people, planning to let Li Chengwan play a certain role in the aggressive military group in the Asian and Pacific region that the United States is putting together.

However, there is no doubt that the Korean people and the peace forces of the world will continue to strike at the US's "position of strength" policy. Although the United States has interrupted the discussion of the Korean issue, the Korean issue has never been erased from the agenda of international conferences.

The plan of our delegation, supported by the Soviet and Chinese delegations at the Geneva Conference, pointed out a clear path for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and became the action program for all Korean people to strive for the peaceful reunification of the motherland.

It fully conforms to the national interests of the Korean people and expresses the unanimous aspirations of peace-loving people all over the world.

Therefore, the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue must be resolved through consultation in accordance with the principles of the plan put forward by our delegation. The Korean people demand to unify our country by peaceful means, and oppose maintaining the state of division caused by the war. Korea must belong to the Korean people themselves, and the Korean people do not want to live in a state of north-south division. Any trick of the US imperialists cannot stop the Korean people's legitimate demand for the peaceful reunification of their motherland.

The Korean Labor Party led by Marshal Kim Il-sung, the government of the Republic, and all the Korean people are convinced that with the support of peace-loving people all over the world, the just and great cause of striving for our country's peace, unification, independence, and democratic development will surely achieve final victory.

    停战协定签订一周年
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内阁副首相  洪命熹
    自朝鲜停战实现之日起，已历时一年了。
    朝鲜停战的达成，不仅是朝鲜人民的历史性胜利，也是整个和平力量的胜利，它有助于缓和国际紧张局势和建立亚洲和平的事业，并提供了以和平方式最后解决朝鲜问题的可能性。
    停战后，在朝鲜人民面前提出来的新的任务，就是和平解决朝鲜问题和迅速恢复与发展被战争所严重破坏的国民经济，使人民生活得到稳定。
    这种任务的实行，只有在共和国北半部才有可能。但在我国的南半部继续留驻美国侵略军队并保持着只有依靠美军的刺刀才能维持的殖民地奴隶制度。这种情况使共和国的南部与北部，在停战后各自走向显然相反的路。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府根据自己的和平政策，在以苏联和中华人民共和国为首的全世界爱好和平力量的积极支持下，使共和国北半部地区由停战走向巩固的和平，并使我国在民主基础上和平统一的工作得以向前推进。为此目的，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府首先自停战协定签订后直到今天忠实地遵守了并继续遵守着停战协定。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府为了召开旨在达成和平统一朝鲜的任务并在停战协定中有所规定的朝鲜政治会议，曾在双方会谈中提出了自己的合理方案，并为达成协议作了努力。但是，美国代表团却拒绝了我方代表团所提出的方案，片面地宣布了无限期休会，终于破坏了政治会议的召开。
    停战协定签订后，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府在为使我国国民经济全面恢复的和平建设工作中进行了创造性的努力。与此同时，为稳定与提高战后人民的生活水平，三次减低了人民所需的日用品和食品的零售价格，并为保证勤劳人民的住宅和改善劳动供给工作采取了措施，减轻了小生产农民和受灾农民所负的各种国家负担，废弃了国家收买肉类制度，并拨出巨额的贷款等。为了改善工人、技术人员和职员们的物质生活，提高工资百分之二十五到百分之五十，并为提高城市和农村居民的生活，改善并加强了水产物的供给工作。政府为了保护母亲和幼儿，改善了医疗机关的工作，急速恢复和扩充保健文化设备，使之普及到各个方面。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府在恢复与发展国民经济的工作中，获得不少的成就。在停战后的一年当中，恢复了很多的工厂、矿山和企业，并有很多工厂全面地展开了生产工作，恢复了铁路和桥梁，在废墟中重建雄伟的城市。这个成就，是由于我国人民的忘我的创造性劳动，和苏联、中华人民共和国以及各人民民主国家对我们的巨大的兄弟般的援助所达成的。这种兄弟般的援助，标志着和平民主阵营中热情的互助和牢不可破的友谊的特征。
    四月间所通过的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国一九五四年—一九五六年的三年计划，对有效地进行恢复与建设战后国民经济的工作和全面地发展和提高居民的生活水平方面，将产生巨大的效果。在此期间将建设能生产过去朝鲜产业所未能生产的产品的新的企业。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的国民收入，一九五六年将比一九四九年增加百分之三十以上，比一九五三年增加百分之七十五以上。在过去一年内，共和国北半部的朝鲜人民，在战后恢复与建设的工作中所取得的初步成就，充分显示了建立在我国北半部的人民民主制度的充沛的生命力，和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国争取和平统一全国的物质力量。
    然而，停战后的过去一年中，美帝国主义者继续采取着备战政策的南半部情况，与此完全相反。美帝国主义者虽然在朝鲜战场上遭到失败，但仍不抛弃“实力”政策的妄想，企图在亚洲进行新的军事冒险。去年一年中，美方不断地违反了停战协定，并正在违反着。美国不顾停战协定中已达成协议的条款，强迫扣留四万八千名朝中战俘，移交给李承晚匪帮和蒋介石匪帮，并在去年八月八日与南朝鲜傀儡政府缔结了“美韩共同防御条约”。这一条约保证了美国侵略军队永远驻扎南朝鲜，并由美国约定政治会议的期限为三个月，过期即与李承晚代表“同时退出会场”。美国方面严重地违反停战协定，向南朝鲜地区运入大量的作战物资的拆散品和零件，并百般地限制和阻挠波兰和捷克斯洛伐克委员在中立国监察委员及其小组的工作，甚至阴谋破坏中立国监察委员会本身。
    因为，中立国监察委员会向全世界人民暴露了美国横蛮地违反停战协定和他们在南朝鲜实行着的战争准备政策。
    美国正在南朝鲜疯狂地加紧扩充傀儡军，将征丁年龄和军队后备军——所谓民兵队的服务年限从十七岁延长至满三十岁到四十岁，把他们强制地编入军队。
    美帝国主义者们，以增强傀儡军的工作，和指使李承晚匪帮继续叫嚣“北进统一”，来传播战争气氛。
    日内瓦会议关于朝鲜问题的讨论决裂后的第二天，傀儡国务总理兼外交部长官卞荣泰说，南朝鲜不再继续受到停战协定的约束。当天李承晚在汉城说，“统一的唯一的办法是使用武力”。
    由于美国在南朝鲜推行追求战争的政策，使得受到战争破坏的南朝鲜人民的生活，更加陷于悲惨的境地。
    根据南朝鲜公开的资料，一九五三年末的食品工业比战前水平减少到了五分之一；其他部门比它减少得更多。
    由于美帝国主义和李承晚卖国匪帮的反动的土地政策和残酷的掠夺政策，使南朝鲜逐日地变成为严重的饥寒地带，抛弃土地而流浪的农民的数目日益增加，依据李承晚匪帮缩小了的调查公报，一九五三年达三百余万名。李承晚傀儡政府不顾这种情况，依然为了巨大的军费开支而扩大预算的赤字，加强对人民的掠夺。
    一九五三年的财政赤字已达四百二十九亿圆
  （伪币）。今年度预算二千四百二十三亿圆中，把支出总额的百分之九十以上划充为军费开支。增加了十六种的税金。
    六月三十日，南朝鲜的货币发行总额突破了三百一十六亿圆。一九五三年十二月末，汉城的零售价格指数比一九四七年四月暴涨了七十七倍。现在南朝鲜有数百万失业者、战争灾民、五十万以上的战争孤儿、数万的所谓“残废”军人们，被剥夺了所有的生活机会而陷在饥饿、失业及疾病和物价高涨的地狱里。
    以上是反对渴望祖国和平统一的朝鲜人民的美国在南朝鲜施行的战争政策的简单的一年总结。
    今天，朝鲜人民一致地盼望解除在我国被人为地划定了的敌对的军事状态，而迅速恢复我国的统一。
    美国对朝鲜人民这样迫切的愿望和朝鲜人民为和平解决朝鲜问题而作的始终一贯的努力，竟以“协商无用”和“破坏协商”来回答。
    但是，美帝国主义者企图阻挠朝鲜问题的和平解决，继续维持国际紧张局势的背信行为和卑劣的策划，在强大的世界和平力量面前绝对不能实现。
    柏林四外长会议根据苏联外长莫洛托夫的提议，曾解除了美国人为制造的和平解决朝鲜问题上的难局，决定召开日内瓦会议以讨论朝鲜问题。
    在日内瓦会议上，我国代表团基于朝鲜问题应由朝鲜人民自己解决的原则，提出了一切外国军队撤出朝鲜，根据朝鲜人民的自由意志，举行全朝鲜自由选举，迅速恢复朝鲜的国家统一，巩固朝鲜和平的合理而正当的方案，并且始终努力谋求达成协议。
    苏联和中华人民共和国代表团完全支持我国代表团提出的方案，并根据这一方案提出了自己的一定的方案，作了巨大的努力以谋求达成协议。但是，美国及其仆从国家代表们，无视朝鲜人民的利益和民族权利，企图以朝鲜战争的交战一方——联合国来“监督”选举，把美国在南朝鲜树立的殖民地法西斯统治制度扩展到共和国北半部。它主张美国军队长期驻扎在南朝鲜，却要求中国人民志愿军片面撤军。美国固执这种不合理的主张，阻挠和破坏了朝鲜问题的讨论，使朝鲜问题依然是悬而未决的国际问题，以便维持国际紧张局势，疯狂准备新战争。
    日内瓦会议讨论朝鲜问题的全部过程，明白地暴露了谁在阻碍着朝鲜问题的和平解决，谁是人民的民族利益和世界和平的敌人。
    停战协定签定后直到今天，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国始终不渝地为实现祖国的和平统一作了一切努力。
  由于渴望祖国和平统一的朝鲜人民的一致努力，及苏联和中国以及全世界和平力量的努力，达成了朝鲜停战，它开辟了任何国际争端都能够在尊重人民的民族利益和权利的基础上，获得和平解决的道路，创造了以协商方法解决国际争端的范例。
    印度支那和平的恢复，是对亚洲和平的巨大贡献，将进一步缓和国际紧张局势。印度支那的停火又一次明白地显示了国际争端可以用协商的方法解决。美帝国主义者所叫嚣的“协商无用”的说法可耻地被粉碎了。一年前签定的朝鲜停战协定和目前签定的印度支那停火协定再次证实了美帝国主义者及其追随者们不愿接受在朝鲜和印度支那的教训，而固执其狂妄的侵略政策的结果，使它在全世界人民面前更加孤立，不可避免地遭受更严重的惨败。
    印度支那协定之签定，使全世界爱好和平人民更加相信，没有任何国际问题不可以通过协商方式加以解决。它更加巩固了爱好和平人民争取缓和国际紧张局势，巩固世界和平的斗争的胜利信心。
    最近，美国的统治者们在华盛顿和汉城，继续准备着反对朝鲜人民的新的军事冒险，策划着让李承晚在美国正在拼凑的亚洲及太平洋区域侵略性的军事集团中担任一定的角色。
    但是，毫无疑问地，朝鲜人民和全世界人民的和平力量将继续给美国的“实力政策”以打击。美国虽然中断了朝鲜问题的讨论，但是，朝鲜问题绝没从国际会议的议程上抹掉。
    在日内瓦会议上受到苏联和中华人民共和国代表团支持的我国代表团的方案，指出了以和平方法解决朝鲜问题的明确的道路，成为了争取祖国和平统一的全朝鲜人民的行动纲领。
    它完全符合于朝鲜人民的民族利益，表示了全世界爱好和平人民的一致愿望。
    因此，朝鲜问题的和平解决必须依照我国代表团提出的方案的原则，以协商的方法予以解决。朝鲜人民要求以和平方法统一我国，反对维持由于战争所造成的分裂状态。朝鲜必须成为朝鲜人民自己的，朝鲜人民不希望生活在南北分裂的情况之中。美帝国主义者的任何诡计都阻挡不住朝鲜人民要求祖国的和平统一的正当要求。
    以金日成元帅所领导的朝鲜劳动党、共和国政府和全朝鲜人民，确信在全世界爱好和平人民的声援下，争取我国的和平、统一、独立和民主发展的正当伟业，必将获得最后胜利。
