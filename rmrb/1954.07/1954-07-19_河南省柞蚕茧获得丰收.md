Henan Province has achieved a bumper harvest of tussah silkworm cocoons this year. According to incomplete statistics, the province's total output this year may increase by 20% compared to last year, exceeding this year's plan by about 8%. During production, silkworm farmers were in high spirits, widely carrying out frost prevention and insect catching movements, implementing reasonable division of labor, strengthening technical guidance on breeding and silkworm farm management. Coupled with normal weather this year, a bumper harvest was generally achieved. Lushan County alone harvested more than 360 million silkworm cocoons this year, more than doubling last year's output. In particular, the output of mutual aid and cooperation organizations is generally more than 25% higher than that of individual silkworm farmers.

    河南省柞蚕茧获得丰收
    河南省今年柞蚕茧获得丰收。据不完全统计全省今年总产量可比去年增加二成，超额完成今年计划百分之八左右。在生产中，蚕农们情绪很高，普遍开展防霜、捕虫运动，实行合理分工，加强饲育技术指导和蚕场管理，又加上今年气候正常，因而普遍获得丰收。鲁山县今年就收了三亿六千多万粒蚕茧，比去年增产了一倍多。特别是互助合作组织的产量，一般比单干蚕农高出百分之二十五以上。
