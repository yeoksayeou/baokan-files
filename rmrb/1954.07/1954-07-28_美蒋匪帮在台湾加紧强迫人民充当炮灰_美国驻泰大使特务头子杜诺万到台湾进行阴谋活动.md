Xinhua News Agency, July 27th: Taiwan News: The Kuomintang remnant group entrenched in Taiwan, under the instigation of U.S. imperialism, is coercing Taiwanese youth, students, and farmers into military training, turning Taiwan into a barracks for the American-Chiang Kai-shek clique.

The Chiang Kai-shek gang's so-called fifth phase of "supplementary soldiers" and the second phase of "reserve non-commissioned officers" training began in July of this year. Tens of thousands of Taiwanese farmers and middle school graduates are being forcibly conscripted into camps for military training. Female students are also being forced to undergo so-called "military auxiliary and service training." After four months of military training, some of these farmers and students will be forced to join the Chiang Kai-shek army, while others will be assigned to the Chiang Kai-shek gang's so-called "reserve soldiers" organization, their actions controlled by the Chiang Kai-shek gang and forbidden from leaving Taiwan, ready to be "conscripted" at any time. Graduates of universities and colleges are also being forced to join the so-called "reserve officer training class" and undergo one year of military training.

Fishermen and sailors in coastal areas are also required to undergo Chiang Kai-shek's naval military training; those who do not are prohibited from going to sea and fishing.

The Chiang Kai-shek gang is also coercing a large number of students to participate in the so-called "summer youth combat training," forming "military service" or "rural service" teams. In July of this year, more than 32,000 Taiwanese youth students were coerced into participating in this "summer youth combat training." Some of these male and female students have been transported to the Chiang Kai-shek gang's troops in Jinmen Island and other places to "serve."

The Chiang Kai-shek gang's insane actions of forcing the people of Taiwan to serve as cannon fodder and coercing them into military training have created a scene of terror in Taiwan. Many farmers and students are unwilling to accept the Chiang Kai-shek gang's military training and unwilling to serve as cannon fodder for the American-Chiang Kai-shek clique. Some have left home to escape, and students deliberately repeat grades or do not participate in graduation exams. In order to prevent the people of Taiwan from escaping conscription and military training, the American-Chiang Kai-shek clique has ordered that all men between the ages of 18 and 30 be prohibited from leaving Taiwan and frequently conducts "surprise household registration checks" and "major security checks" to capture soldiers and arrest people.

The American-Chiang Kai-shek clique's insane coercion of the people of Taiwan to serve as cannon fodder and coercion into military training has turned Taiwan into a terrifying barracks. The people of Taiwan cannot tolerate the brutal rule of the American-Chiang Kai-shek clique and are trying every means to escape the persecution of the American-Chiang Kai-shek clique.
Xinhua News Agency, July 27th: The U.S. authorities are actively engaging in further military collusion between the Chiang Kai-shek gang in Taiwan, the Thai and Philippine authorities, and the South Korean Syngman Rhee group to strengthen their aggression and war activities against China.

According to U.S. news agency reports, U.S. Ambassador to Thailand and intelligence chief Donovan will visit Taiwan on his way back to Bangkok from Washington. The report said that after Donovan arrives in Taiwan, he will consult with U.S. military personnel and officials stationed in Taiwan, as well as the Chiang Kai-shek gang. United Press news revealed that the purpose of this trip is part of the U.S.'s plan to intensify the formation of an Asian aggressive bloc to encircle the People's Republic of China after the failure to prevent the armistice in Indochina. The report said: "In view of the Indochina ceasefire, Donovan will study the coordination of security measures between Taiwan, Thailand, and other Southeast Asian countries."

At the same time, according to Agence France-Presse, a Thai military delegation that went to Washington to consult with the U.S. government on expanding the Thai army and organizing a Southeast Asian military alliance will also visit Taiwan. In addition, the Syngman Rhee group recently wants to send five gunboats to Taiwan for "friendly" "visits."

The U.S. is also stepping up the transportation of military supplies to Taiwan. There are reports that after the Indochina armistice agreement was reached, the U.S. decided to divert the $80 million worth of U.S. military supplies and equipment originally destined for Indochina to Taiwan. The U.S. is also hurriedly arranging to transfer the U.S. military equipment that has been transported to northern Vietnam to Thailand.

Syngman Rhee group's Minister of Defense, Son Won-il, who has been constantly clamoring to abolish the Korean Armistice Agreement and to "march north," publicly stated on the 22nd the arrogant intention behind this military arrangement by his U.S. masters to encircle China: to attack China from two "fronts," Taiwan and Korea.

    美蒋匪帮在台湾加紧强迫人民充当炮灰
    美国驻泰大使特务头子杜诺万到台湾进行阴谋活动
    【新华社二十七日讯】台湾消息：盘踞在台湾的国民党残余集团，正在美帝国主义授意下胁迫台湾青年学生和农民受军事训练，把台湾变成一座美蒋匪帮的兵营。
    蒋匪的所谓第五期“补充兵”和第二期“预备军士”训练，已在今年七月开始。数以万计的台湾农民和中等学校毕业学生被强征入营受军事训练。女学生也被强制受所谓“军事辅助和勤务训练”。这些农民和学生受完四个月的军事训练后，一部分将被强迫编入蒋匪军队，另一部分回家后，将被编入蒋匪的所谓“在乡军人”组织，一切行动受蒋匪统辖，并禁止离开台湾，随时准备被“征召”。各大学、专科学校毕业生，也都被强迫编入所谓“预备军官训练班”，要受一年的军事训练。
    沿海地区的渔民和海员，同样要受蒋匪海军军事训练，不受训的被禁止出海和捕鱼。
    大批在校学生，蒋匪也胁迫他们参加所谓“暑期青年战斗训练”，组成“军中服务”或“农村服务”队。今年七月有三万二千多名台湾青年学生被胁迫参加这种“暑期青年战斗训练”。其中一部男女学生，已被运送到金门岛等地的蒋匪军队中“服务”。
    蒋匪帮这种疯狂地强迫台湾人民充当炮灰和胁迫受军事训练的行动，已在台湾造成恐怖景象。许多农民、学生不愿受蒋匪的军事训练，不愿充当美蒋匪帮的炮灰，有的离家逃避，学生们就故意留级或不参加毕业考试。美蒋匪帮为防止台湾人民逃避征兵和军事训练，曾命令禁止所有十八岁到三十岁的男子离开台湾，并经常进行“户口突击大检查”、
  “治安大检查”，抓兵、捕人。
    美蒋匪帮疯狂地强迫台湾人民充当炮灰和胁迫受军事训练，已使台湾变成一座恐怖的兵营。台湾人民不能忍受美蒋匪帮的残暴统治，想尽各种办法来逃避美蒋匪帮的迫害。
   【新华社二十七日讯】美国当局正积极把台湾蒋匪和泰国、菲律宾当局以及南朝鲜李承晚集团进一步在军事上勾结起来，以加强对中国的侵略和战争活动。
    据美国通讯社消息，美国驻泰国大使、特务头子杜诺万最近在从华盛顿返回曼谷途中将到台湾活动。消息说，杜诺万到台湾后将和美国驻台湾的军事人员和官员，以及蒋匪会商。合众社消息透露，此行任务是美国阻挠印度支那停战失败后加紧拼凑包围中华人民共和国的亚洲侵略集团计划的一部分。消息说：“杜诺万鉴于印度支那停火，将研究台湾、泰国和其他东南亚国家之间的安全措施的配合问题”。
    同时，据法新社消息透露，到华盛顿和美国政府会商扩充泰国军队以及组织东南亚军事联盟的泰国军事代表团也将到台湾活动。另外，李承晚集团最近要派遣五艘炮舰，到台湾作“亲善”“访问”。
    美国并且在加紧把军事物资运送到台湾去。有消息说，在印度支那停战协议达成后，美国已决定把原定运到印度支那的八千万美元的美国军事供应和装备，改运到台湾。美国也在匆忙安排把已运到越南北部的美国军事装备转运到泰国去。
    不断在叫嚣着要废除朝鲜停战协定、要“北进”的李承晚集团的国防部长官孙元一在二十二日公开道出了他的美国主子这种包围中国的军事安排背后的狂妄企图：从台湾及朝鲜两条“战线”进攻中国。
