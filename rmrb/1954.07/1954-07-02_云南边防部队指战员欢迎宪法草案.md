Xinhua News Agency:

    Yunnan border defense troops and commanders were jubilant when the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China was delivered to the Yunnan border front. When the newspaper carrying the Draft Constitution was delivered to a construction site of a certain unit, the entire site erupted in excitement. Soldiers gathered around, excitedly reading the full text of the Draft Constitution aloud. Many convalescents in the hospital, unable to wait for the newspaper to be delivered to their rooms, leaned on their crutches and asked staff to read it to them. Cadres and soldiers on the defense line spontaneously organized discussions. They all expressed their determination to study and discuss the Draft Constitution thoroughly. They also felt proud of the glorious task they shoulder in safeguarding the border of the motherland. Deputy Regiment Commander and combat hero Zhang Baozhen said: Our country is still under the threat of imperialism. We must be a hundred times more vigilant, accelerate the construction of a modern national defense force, and resolutely carry out the glorious task stipulated for us in Article 20 of the Draft Constitution.

    云南边防部队指战员欢迎宪法草案
    中华人民共和国宪法草案传送到云南边防线上，警卫边疆的中国人民解放军边防部队立刻欢腾起来。当刊登宪法草案的报纸送到某部修建工地时，全工地都沸腾起来了，战士们纷纷围在一起，兴奋地诵读着宪法草案全文。许多在医院里的休养人员，等不及报纸送到病室，就拄着拐杖找工作人员念给他们听。在国防线上的干部和战士纷纷自动地组织了漫谈。他们都表示要好好地学习和讨论宪法草案。他们并为自己所担负的保卫祖国边疆的光荣任务而感到自豪。副团长、战斗英雄张保珍说：我们的国家还处在帝国主义的威胁下，我们一定要百倍警惕，加速建设现代化国防军，坚决执行宪法草案第二十条给我们规定的光荣任务。
