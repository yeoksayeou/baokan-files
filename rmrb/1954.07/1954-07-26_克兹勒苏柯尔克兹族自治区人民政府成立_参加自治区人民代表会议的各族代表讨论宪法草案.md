    The first session of the first People's Representative Conference of the Kizilsu Kirghiz Autonomous Region in southern Xinjiang Province was held in Artush from July 10th to 14th. 156 representatives from ethnic groups including Kirghiz, Uyghur, Han, Hui, Tajik, and Uzbek attended the meeting. Saifulaev (Uyghur), Deputy Director of the Organization Department of the Xinjiang Branch Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, Song Jun, Deputy Director of the United Front Work Department, Zuo Qi, Second Secretary of the CPC Southern Xinjiang District Committee, and Iminov (Uyghur), Fourth Secretary, attended the meeting to offer congratulations.
    At the meeting, representatives of all ethnic groups discussed and approved the summary report of the past four years and the report on the future work tasks of the autonomous region. The report pointed out that in the four years since liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the higher-level People's Government, and due to the implementation of the policy of ethnic equality, the region's animal husbandry, agricultural production, trade cooperation, and cultural and educational health undertakings have greatly developed; land reform and grassroots elections have been carried out in agricultural areas, which has improved the patriotism and political awareness of the people of all ethnic groups. In recent years, the region has also trained more than 1,100 cadres of various ethnic groups, creating favorable conditions for the implementation of regional autonomy. In the future, the people of all ethnic groups in the autonomous region must unite more closely, vigorously develop animal husbandry and agricultural production, and support the industrial construction of the motherland.
    The meeting exercised the functions and powers of the People's Congress, elected Maimaiti Aisha (Kirghiz) as Chairman of the People's Government of the Autonomous Region, Li Yueliang (Han) as Vice Chairman (with one position for a Uyghur Vice Chairman reserved), and Aman Tuer (Kirghiz) and 25 others as members, thus establishing the People's Government of the Kizilsu Kirghiz Autonomous Region; at the same time, Maimaiti Tursun and Aisha Ali (both Kirghiz) were elected as representatives to the Xinjiang Provincial People's Congress. Representatives of all ethnic groups also submitted more than 200 proposals to the meeting regarding ethnic unity and the development of the autonomous region. After being sorted out by the meeting, they have been answered or handed over to the People's Government of the autonomous region for handling. The meeting finally passed a congratulatory telegram to Chairman Mao.
    The Kizilsu Kirghiz Autonomous Region is equivalent to a prefecture level and is located in the westernmost part of the motherland, including the three counties of Artush, Wuqia, and Akqi, and parts of the Kirghiz-inhabited areas of the three counties of Puli, Yingjisha, and Shufu. The mountains extending eastward from the Pamir Plateau are within the autonomous region. Every year, when the snow on the peaks of the Pamir Plateau melts, the snow water gathers into countless rivers, irrigating grasslands and farmland. The autonomous region has abundant natural pastures, grazing more than 600,000 head of livestock such as horses, cattle, sheep, and camels; it has more than 300,000 mu of fertile farmland, rich in wheat, cotton, and corn; and its underground contains rich iron, copper, coal, petroleum and other mineral deposits. The autonomous region is inhabited by 135,000 people from eleven ethnic groups, including Kirghiz and Uyghur, of which the Kirghiz account for slightly more than 35 percent. (Xinhua News Agency)
    Xinhua News Agency: The 156 representatives of the Kirghiz, Uyghur, Han, Hui, Uzbek, Tajik and other ethnic groups who attended the first session of the first People's Representative Conference of the Kizilsu Kirghiz Autonomous Region of Xinjiang Province discussed the draft constitution during the meeting and unanimously expressed their warm support. Darman (Kirghiz), a representative from Puli County on the Pamir Plateau, said: "Equality among all ethnic groups and the implementation of regional autonomy are the hopes of our ancestors for generations. Our hopes have only been realized after liberation. Now that the draft constitution stipulates these things again, our nomadic herdsmen, both men and women, on the Pamir Plateau are cheering for the promulgation of the draft constitution." Aydar (Kirghiz), a herdsman representative from Wuqia County, said: "In the old society, we suffered all kinds of oppression and were trampled under the boots of the reactionaries. Today, we are people's representatives, sitting here to discuss our own affairs. We firmly support the draft constitution." Atikulun (Kirghiz), a representative of Wuqia County and a model worker in animal husbandry in Xinjiang Province, made a comparison between his past and present life. He said: "Before liberation, I only had 22 head of livestock. The People's Government led us to cut grass, build sheds, and help with lambing, and also gave us loans. This year, my livestock has increased to more than 290 head. We can't finish drinking the milk, and both of my sons are in school. The draft constitution stipulates that we will help all minority nationalities develop political, economic, and cultural construction undertakings, which guarantees that we will live and produce better in the future." The young Kirghiz female representative, Turhan Bibi, said: "Today, our women work the same as men, serve as representatives, and sit together in meetings. This was unimaginable in the past." Baiyisha (Kirghiz), a representative from Akqi County, and Hatipu Ibrahim (Uyghur), a representative from Artush County, pointed out in their speeches that the establishment of the Kizilsu Kirghiz Autonomous Region is a manifestation of the close unity of all ethnic groups, and the draft constitution is a beacon for the people of all ethnic groups, illuminating the path forward for the people of all ethnic groups. The representatives present unanimously pledged to widely publicize the content of the draft constitution to the herdsmen on the Pamir Plateau. (Xinhua News Agency)

    会议代行人民代表大会职权，选出买买提艾沙
  （柯尔克兹族）为自治区人民政府主席，李月亮
  （汉族）为副主席（另保留维吾尔族副主席名额一个），阿满吐尔（柯尔克兹族）等二十五人为委员，成立了克兹勒苏柯尔克兹族自治区人民政府；同时选出买买提吐尔逊、艾沙阿力二人（都是柯尔克兹族）为新疆省人民代表大会的代表。各族代表还向会议提出二百多件有关民族团结和自治区发展的提案，经会议整理后，已分别答复或交由自治区人民政府处理。会议最后通过向毛主席的致敬电。
    克兹勒苏柯尔克兹族自治区相当于专区级，在祖国的最西部，包括阿图什、乌恰、阿合奇三县，和蒲犁、英吉沙、疏附三县柯尔克兹族聚居地区各一部。帕米尔高原绵延向东的山脉在自治区境内。每年帕米尔高原高峰上的积雪溶化时，雪水汇集成无数河流，灌溉着草原和农田。自治区有丰美的天然牧场，牧放着马、牛、羊、骆驼等各种牲畜六十多万头；有肥沃的农田三十多万亩，盛产小麦、棉花和玉米；地下蕴藏着丰富的铁、铜、煤和石油等矿藏。自治区内聚居着柯尔克兹、维吾尔等十一个民族共十三万五千多人，其中柯尔克兹族占百分之三十五强。　（新华社）
