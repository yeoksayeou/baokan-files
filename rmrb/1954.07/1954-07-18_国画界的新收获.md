　　The Beijing Chinese Painting Research Association is currently holding its second exhibition, one year after the association held its first exhibition. From the works exhibited this time, it can be seen that there have been some noteworthy improvements in the situation of traditional Chinese painting, especially in the improvement of the painters' creative attitudes.

　　The most noteworthy thing is that there are more works with realistic subjects. The long-standing national painting originally had an excellent tradition of realistic art, but later a bad habit prevailed for a long time: not paying attention to depicting real life, not paying attention to artistic creation, but simply copying and imitating the brush and ink of the ancients as the ultimate skill. Therefore, the gradual increase in works expressing realistic things today shows that traditional Chinese painting has made new gains in the struggle against the above-mentioned bad habits. Especially figure painting has made great progress in the selection of themes. Most of the figure paintings and some flower-and-bird paintings and landscape paintings are in contact with new people and new things in real life. Although this type of work has not yet fully achieved the ideal requirements of harmony and coordination in form and content, and in the expression methods of depicting new objects with traditional techniques, and therefore some individual painters despise them, it should be recognized that this is an unavoidable shortcoming in the new transformation process, and these shortcomings can be overcome. Although these new works are not mature today, they can already be considered an important part of national painting. They will surely gradually replace those stagnant and stylistically outdated works in the process of continuously improving artistic quality.

　　Another notable phenomenon is that many of the landscape paintings exhibited based on real mountains and real waters were produced after the painters participated in on-site sketching activities. In the past year, the Beijing Chinese Painting Research Association organized several sketching trips to the suburbs, and landscape painters also used their familiar techniques to directly depict the famous scenery of Beijing and its near suburbs. This spring, with the help of the Chinese Artists Association and the Beijing Chinese Painting Research Association, some landscape painters from Beijing traveled to Huangshan in Anhui and the Fuchun River in Zhejiang for sketching. The East China Artists Association has also recently organized sketching activities for traditional Chinese painters. These activities are necessary, because sketching is the first step in making painting art face real life, and only sketching can make traditional Chinese painters understand the distance between the brush and ink techniques of the ancients and the real scenery, and this distance must be overcome. Real life requires breaking through inherited fixed patterns, and traditional Chinese painters who are willing to take their work seriously must face this problem squarely.

　　Using sketching as the basis for creation by traditional Chinese painters is a real inheritance and development of the realistic tradition of national art, which is beneficial to the development and prosperity of traditional Chinese painting. The traditional forms of traditional Chinese painting need unremitting efforts to fully adapt to the new creative content. In addition to the fundamental problem that traditional Chinese painters must solve by striving to study politics and improve their ideological level, they must also make full use of realistic techniques, improve the scientific nature of traditional techniques, and obtain the ability to express themselves freely. This is another practical problem that urgently needs to be solved.

　　The progress of traditional Chinese painting shown in this exhibition is in line with the hopes of the masses. The successive exhibitions of traditional Chinese painting held since liberation have brought traditional Chinese painting into extensive contact with the masses, and painters have also gained an understanding of the true hobbies and requirements of the broad masses. It can be seen from this that being able to humbly listen to the opinions of the masses and truly express respect for the opinions of the masses with practical actions, in the creation of traditional Chinese painting, as in any other work, is an important condition for ensuring continuous progress.

### 国画界的新收获

    国画界的新收获
    北京中国画研究会现正举行第二届展览会，距去年该会举行的第一届展览会已一年。从这次展出的作品中，可以看出国画的情况又有了一些值得重视的改进，尤其是画家创作态度方面的改进。
    最值得注意的是：以现实事物为题材的作品多起来了。历史悠久的民族绘画，原来具有优良的现实主义艺术传统，但后来却长时期流行着一种不良的风气：不注重描写现实生活，不注重艺术创造，而以单纯地抄袭摹仿古人笔墨为能事。因此，今天表现现实事物的作品的逐渐增多，说明了国画在反对上述不良风气的斗争中，有了新的收获。特别是人物画，在题材选择上有了很大的进步。大部分的人物画以及一部分花鸟画和山水画，是接触到现实生活中的新人和新事物的。这一类作品在形式和内容上、在以传统技法描绘新的对象的表现方法上，虽然还没有完全达到和谐协调的理想要求，因而某些个别的画家对它们表示轻蔑，但是，应当认识，那是在新的变革过程中不易避免的缺点，这些缺点是可以克服的。这类新作品今天虽不成熟，但已经可以认为是民族绘画中的重要部分。它们一定会在不断提高艺术质量的过程中逐渐代替那些停滞不前的风格陈旧的作品。
    另一可注意的现象是：展出的许多以真山真水为根据的山水画，大多是在画家参加了实地写生活动以后产生的。过去一年中，北京中国画研究会组织过几次郊外写生，山水画家也运用自己熟悉的技法转而直接描写北京和北京近郊的名胜风景。今年春季，在中国美术家协会和北京中国画研究会的帮助下，北京一部分山水画家曾赴安徽黄山和浙江富春江等处旅行写生。华东美术家协会最近也组织了国画家的写生活动。这些活动是必要的，因为写生是使绘画艺术面向现实生活的第一步，也只有写生才能使国画家明白古人的笔墨技法和现实景物之间存在着的一段距离，而这一段距离是必须力加克服的。现实生活要求突破因袭的固定格式，愿意严肃对待自己工作的国画家们，必须正视这一问题。
    国画家用写生作为创作的基础，是真正继承和发展民族艺术的现实主义传统，对于国画的发展和繁荣是有好处的。国画的传统形式要完全和新的创作内容相适应，还需要不懈的努力。国画家除了努力学习政治、提高思想水平这一根本问题必须解决外，还要充分利用写实的技术，提高传统技法的科学性，获得自由表现的能力，这是另一个迫切需要解决的实际问题。
    这次展览会所表现的国画的进步，是符合群众的希望的。解放以来历次举行的国画展览，使国画和群众有了广泛接触，画家对于广大群众的真正爱好和要求也有了认识。由此可见，能够虚心听取群众意见，真正以实际行动表现出尊重群众的意见，在国画创作中，如同在任何一切工作中一样，是保证不断前进的重要条件。
