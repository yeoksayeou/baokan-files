    Regarding the problems existing in night shift production and our opinions
    Changchun Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Office
    We investigated the night shift production situation in twelve units, including Changchun Railway Station, Eighth Rubber Factory, Enamel Factory, Daily Chemical Factory, Jiami Printing and Can Making Factory, Jilin Provincial Food Factory, Changchun Machinery Factory, Changchun Metrology Factory, Changchun Gas Factory, Changchun Xinbao Printing Factory, Changchun Garment Factory, and Changchun Glass Factory. Among them, Changchun Railway Station had relatively good night shift work, with production basically balanced with daytime production. The Daily Chemical Factory, Jilin Provincial Food Factory, and Changchun Garment Factory had relatively normal night shift production, but some problems still existed. Most of the remaining units had many problems in night shift production, mainly the following:

    I. No one is responsible for night shift production, and management is chaotic. Most factories' workshop leaders and necessary departments, such as material repair departments, do not implement a night duty system. When problems occur in night shift production, no one is responsible and cannot be resolved in a timely manner, which seriously affects production. For example, the manufacturing department of Changchun Gas Factory has three shifts, day and night. The high-pressure room, refining room, and generator furnace and other departments in the workshop must be closely linked and coordinated to ensure normal production. However, the three directors of the workshop work during the day, and no one unifies the command of the night shift work. Therefore, one night in early January of this year, the refining room found that the gas production was small and notified the generator furnace to add more fire (add coal), but the generator furnace shift leader said: "Without the order of the workshop director, no fire can be added casually." As a result, by dawn, the gas tank had not been burned up, and the gas could not be delivered, affecting users. Another example is that there is no one working night shifts in the repair workshop and material warehouse of Changchun Machinery Factory. One night last December, as soon as the night shift workers in the pressure section of Workshop 1 took over, half of the machine belt broke and needed to be replaced. However, no one was in the warehouse at the time, and it could not be replaced. As a result, more than 20 workers did not produce all night, and it took another two hours to repair it the next day, resulting in a loss of more than 4,000 hinges.

    II. Labor discipline is lax at night, and political work is very weak. For example, in the scissor group of Workshop 1 of Changchun Machinery Factory, on the night shift on January 10, the group leader led more than a dozen workers away from their posts to play poker in the office all night. Song Mingquan, a worker in the lamination section of the factory, hid in the underground heating trench and slept all night during one night shift. Jiami Printing and Can Making Factory worker Liu Ziying violated operating procedures at more than 4:00 AM on January 4, and the No. 1 punch press (the factory's largest machine) was damaged, stopping production and reducing output value by 896 million yuan. Obviously, political work on the night shift is very important, but the party and mass cadres of most factories work during the day and ignore the political and ideological education of night shift workers. Propaganda and mobilization work at night has almost completely come to a standstill.

    III. Insufficient attention is paid to improving the lives and labor protection benefits of night shift workers. Night shift workers in the Enamel Factory often cannot get food after work, and sometimes the food is cold. The night meals for night shift workers in the Garment Factory are often leftovers from the day, and there are frequent occurrences of sour vegetables and insufficient rice. Some workers with stomach problems need to eat porridge, but the kitchen often makes dry food. As a result, workers with stomach problems have to ask for leave to rest after working for two or three hours because of stomach pain. In addition, many factories' clinics do not have night shifts either, and night shift workers cannot get treatment when they are sick, causing some workers to ask for leave to go home for minor illnesses.

    Due to the existence of the above problems, night shift output is low, quality is poor, and attendance rate is low. According to statistics from Workshop 1 of Changchun Machinery Factory from January 15 to 26 this year, night shift output only reached 75.4% of daytime output. According to statistics from Groups 1 and 2 of the Jiami Printing and Can Making Factory from December 19 to 27 last year, night shift output only reached 90.9%. According to statistics from Workshop 3 of the State-owned Eighth Rubber Factory from January 3 to 21 this year, the daytime attendance rate was 96.32%, while the night shift attendance rate was only 92.99%. During the same period, night shift output also only reached 83.8% of daytime output, seriously affecting the balanced completion of enterprise plans.

    The reason why these problems exist in night shift production is primarily due to the lack of understanding among enterprise leaders regarding the importance of comprehensively and balancedly completing national plans, and insufficient attention to night shift production. For example, the leaders of Changchun Machinery Factory mistakenly believe: "Our night shift production volume is less than one-third of the daytime production volume," thus leaving night shift management in a state of irresponsibility. There is not even a recorder, and the night shift production figures cannot be accurately grasped. In November of last year, the planned night shift production of hinges was 2,500 pairs, but only 50 pairs were actually produced. The planned production of screws was 220 kilograms, but only 13 kilograms were actually produced. The next day, when the dispatcher discovered it, he asked the section chief, who did not know the reason, saying that the gear wheel was broken, and that the saw was faulty, but in reality, the workers were in a bad mood and went to sleep. The factory's trade union chairman also does not pay enough attention to night shift production, emphasizing: "I can't take care of the night if I take care of the day," but does not play the role of the organization, equipping or designating trade union cadres to be responsible for night shift political work, causing the chaotic situation of night shift production to exist for a long time.

    Secondly, enterprise leaders do not provide enough education and care for night shift workers and cannot guarantee workers sufficient sleep, resulting in violations of labor discipline. The third workshop of the Enamel Factory has continuous shifts, and the working hours of cadres above the group leader level are generally 10 hours. With many meetings, sometimes even six hours of sleep cannot be guaranteed. General workers also have to work for nine hours, and there are also two hours of cultural learning at noon, and sometimes they have to participate in some meetings, so they can only sleep for a maximum of seven hours during the day. White and night shift workers in Jiami Printing and Can Making Factory sleep in the same dormitory. The daytime workers' lunch break affects the sleep of the night shift workers. When many factories' young workers do night shifts, they play during the day, and they doze off during night production, disrupting labor discipline. Some workers also have to help their families buy rice, buy vegetables, handle housework, or cannot sleep due to children crying after night shift production, which also affects workers' night production.

    The night shift production plan is a component of the enterprise's overall production plan. If night shift production is not good, the enterprise's production plan will inevitably not be completed in a balanced and comprehensive manner, affecting the promotion of plan management work. Therefore, enterprise leaders must pay as much attention to night shift production as they do to daytime production. The erroneous views and behaviors that night shift production is not important, or emphasizing that there are few people and they cannot take care of it, and not seriously solving the problems existing in night shift work, must be corrected. Necessary systems in night shift management should be established and improved, such as the night duty system for workshop directors, section chiefs, material administrators, and machine repairmen, strictly implementing quality inspection, shift handover, and other systems to ensure the smooth progress of night shift production.

    Trade union work on the night shift should be strengthened. During night shift production hours, the trade union must have someone specifically responsible for carrying out political work on the night shift. Full-time trade union cadres in all larger factories or workshops should implement a "follow-the-shift" system. Units without full-time trade union cadres should also designate part-time trade union cadres responsible for trade union work on the night shift. At the same time, trade union cadres in various units should assist the administration in establishing and improving various night shift management systems as needed and as possible.

    Effective measures must be taken to ensure that night shift workers have sufficient sleep and consolidate night shift labor discipline. The low attendance rate and lax labor discipline of night workers are due in part to workers not getting enough sleep during the day. Therefore, enterprise administration and trade union leaders should strengthen propaganda and education for workers, improve the democratic life of trade union groups, conduct criticism and self-criticism, so that workers can overcome the idea of not attaching importance to or not wanting to do night shifts, avoid disrupting night shift labor discipline, and enable night shift workers to maintain the same enthusiasm for production as daytime workers. At the same time, the workers' families should also be educated on the importance of doing housework well and ensuring that workers have sufficient rest for balanced production, and organize families to help each other overcome difficulties to ensure that night shift workers have sufficient sleep. The administration should, if possible, solve the sleep problems of workers in collective dormitories, ensuring that workers on the same shift are adjusted to be in the same dormitory. If conditions do not permit, the management of the dormitory should also be strengthened, dormitory regulations should be formulated to ensure that the dormitory is quiet during the day and does not affect the sleep of night shift workers. Meetings and activities during night shift workers' spare time should also be streamlined as much as possible, and study time should also be arranged appropriately. Factories should ensure that workers can drink boiled water, eat hot meals, and hot dishes at night, and continuously absorb workers' opinions to improve night meals. Special dormitories should be set up as much as possible for night shift workers who live outside the factory to sleep after finishing their shifts in the middle of the night. Factory clinics should, if possible, have medical personnel on duty at night, so that workers can receive treatment at any time if they become ill.

    关于夜班生产中存在的问题和我们的意见
    长春市工会联合会办公室
    我们调查了长春市铁路车站、第八橡胶厂、搪瓷厂、日用化学厂、嘉美印刷制罐厂、吉林省食品厂、长春机械厂、长春度量衡厂、长春煤气厂、长春新报印刷厂、长春服装厂、长春玻璃厂等十二个单位的夜班生产情况，其中除长春铁路车站夜班工作较好，生产和白天基本达到平衡，日用化学厂、吉林省食品厂和长春服装厂等单位的夜班生产一般较正常，但也存在一些问题外，其余大部分单位在夜班生产中均存在着不少问题，主要的有以下几个：
    一、夜班生产无人负责，管理工作混乱。大多数工厂的车间领导干部和必要的部门如材料修理等部门都没有实行夜间值班制度，夜班生产发生问题无人负责，不能及时解决，严重影响生产。例如长春煤气厂制造部是昼夜三班生产的，车间里高压室、精制室、发生炉等部门彼此都必须密切联系，协同动作，才能保证正常生产，但该车间三个主任都做白班，夜班工作无人统一指挥，因此，今年一月上旬有一天夜里，精制室发现煤气发生量小，通知发生炉多加火（添煤），但发生炉值班长说： “车间主任没有命令，不能随便加火”，结果到天明时，煤气大缸还未烧起来，差一点送不出煤气，影响用户使用。又如长春机械厂修理车间和材料仓库夜班均无人工作，去年十二月有一天晚上，一车间压力工段夜班工人刚一接班，机器皮带就断了半截，需要更换，但当时仓库无人，不能更换，结果二十多个工人一夜没生产，第二天又花了两个钟头才修理好，约少出合页四千多付。
    二、夜间劳动纪律松弛，政治工作很薄弱。如长春机械厂一车间剪刀组，一月十日夜班生产时，小组长领着全组十多个工人离开工作岗位到办公室打了一夜扑克；该厂捻片工段工人宋明全有一次夜班生产时，藏在地下暖气沟里睡了一夜觉。嘉美印刷制罐厂工人刘子瀛在一月四日后半夜四点多钟违犯操作规程，一号冲床（该厂最大的机器）被损坏，停止了生产，减少产值达八亿九千六百万元。很显然，夜班的政治工作是十分重要的，但多数工厂的党群干部全都在白天进行工作，忽视对夜班生产工人的政治思想教育，夜间的宣传鼓动工作简直是完全陷于停顿。
    三、不注意改进夜班工人的生活和劳保福利。搪瓷厂夜班工人下班后经常吃不到饭，有时饭菜都凉了。服装厂夜班工人的夜饭经常是白天剩下的，还经常发生菜酸和饭不够的现象；有些有胃病的工人要吃稀的，而厨房却常做干的，因此，有胃病的工人干二、三小时胃痛就要请假休息。另外，不少厂的医务所也无人值夜班，夜班工人有了病也没法治疗，致使有些工人有点小病就要请假回家。
    由于存在着上述这些问题，就造成夜班产量少、质量差、出勤率低的现象。据长春机械厂一车间今年一月十五日至二十六日的统计，夜班产量仅达白班产量的百分之七十五点四。嘉美印刷制罐厂一、二两组去年十二月十九日至二十七日的统计，夜班产量仅达百分之九十点九。国营第八橡胶厂三车间今年一月三日到二十一日的统计，白班出勤率为百分之九十六点三二，而夜班出勤率只有百分之九十二点九九，同一时间夜班产量也仅达白班产量的百分之八十三点八。严重的影响了企业计划的均衡完成。
    夜班生产之所以存在这些问题，首先是由于企业的领导干部对全面均衡完成国家计划的重要意义认识不足，对夜班生产重视不够。如长春机械厂领导干部错误的认为：“我们夜班生产量还不到白班的三分之一”，因此使夜班管理处于无人负责状态，甚至连记录员都没有，对夜班生产数字不能确实掌握。该厂去年十一月份有一次计划夜班生产合页二千五百付，实际只生产五十付；计划生产螺丝帽二百二十公斤，实际只生产十三公斤，第二天调度员发现后问段长，段长不知道原因，说是牙轮坏了，又说是闷锯坏了，实际是工人闹情绪去睡觉了。该厂工会主席对夜班生产也很不重视，强调说：“我一个人顾了白天就顾不了晚上”，却不去发挥组织作用，配备或指定工会干部负责夜班政治工作，致使夜班生产混乱的情况长期存在。
    其次，是企业的领导上对夜班工人的教育和照顾不够，不能保证工人充分的睡眠，造成违反劳动纪律现象。搪瓷厂第三车间是连带上班的，一般组长以上干部工作时间都要十小时，加上会议多，有时连六小时的睡眠都不能保证；一般工人工作也要九小时，中午还要二小时文化学习，有时也要参加一些会议，白天最多睡七小时。嘉美印刷制罐厂白、夜班工人都睡在一个宿舍里，白班工人午休时影响夜班工人睡眠。许多工厂的青工做夜班时，白天贪玩，晚上生产就打瞌睡，破坏劳动纪律。还有些工人夜班生产回家后，还要帮家里买米、买菜，处理家务，或因小孩吵闹不能睡觉，也影响工人夜间生产。
    夜班生产计划是企业整个生产计划的一个组成部分，如果夜班生产不好，势必使企业的生产计划不能均衡全面的完成，影响计划管理工作的推行。因此，企业领导干部对夜班生产必须与白班生产同样重视，那种认为夜班生产关系不大，或强调人少照顾不过来，而不认真解决夜班工作中存在的问题的错误看法和行为，都必须纠正。应该建立与健全夜班管理上必要的制度，如车间主任、工段长、材料管理员、机器修理工的夜间值班制度，严格执行质量检查，交接班等制度，保证夜班生产的顺利进行。
    夜班的工会工作应该加强。在夜班生产时间内，工会必须有专人负责进行夜班的政治工作。凡较大工厂或车间的工会专职干部，都应实行“跟班”制度，没有工会专职干部的单位也应指定夜班生产的工会兼职干部负责夜班的工会工作。同时，各单位的工会干部应协助行政上根据需要和可能建立与健全夜班的各种管理制度。
    必须采取各种有效措施保证夜班职工有充分的睡眠，巩固夜班劳动纪律。夜间工人出勤率低，劳动纪律松弛，其重要原因之一是职工白天睡眠不足，因此，企业行政和工会领导上应加强对工人的宣传教育，健全工会小组的民主生活，开展批评与自我批评，使工人克服不重视或不愿做夜班的思想，避免破坏夜班劳动纪律的行为，使夜班职工保持和白班同样的生产热情。同时也要对职工家属进行做好家务，保证职工充分休息对均衡生产的重要意义的教育，并组织家属互相帮助克服困难，保证夜班职工有充分的睡眠。行政上应在可能情况下解决集体宿舍工人睡眠问题，保证把同班的工人调整在一个宿舍内，如条件不许可时，也要加强宿舍的管理，订立宿舍公约，保证白天宿舍安静，不影响夜班工人的睡眠。对夜班工人业余时间的会议和活动，也要尽量精简，学习时间亦应安排得适当。工厂在夜间要保证职工都能喝到开水，吃到热饭、热菜，并不断吸收工人意见改进夜间的伙食。对在厂外住宿的夜班工人，应尽可能设置专门宿舍，供他们半夜下班后睡觉。工厂的医务室，在可能条件下，夜间亦应有值班医务人员，工人如发生疾病可以随时治疗。
