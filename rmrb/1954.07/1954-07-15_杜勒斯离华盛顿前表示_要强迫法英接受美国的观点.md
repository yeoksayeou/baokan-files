Xinhua News Agency, July 14th: TASS Washington, July 13th—U.S. Secretary of State John Foster Dulles left Washington on the afternoon of July 12th to fly to Paris for a meeting with French Prime Minister Pierre Mendès France and British Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden. The meeting will be held on July 13th. Dulles made a statement before leaving Washington. This statement shows that the United States is making a new effort to force France and Britain to accept American views on Indochina and other issues. Dulles pointed out that his trip was due to the United States' deep concern about developments in Indochina and Europe. He said that the United States is trying to get France, Britain, and the United States to take consistent action.

Dulles had indicated that the American ruling circles were not interested in a peaceful resolution of the Indochina issue, while the purpose of the Geneva Conference was precisely to peacefully resolve the Indochina issue. He said that his trip to Paris did not mean abandoning the previously stated position, namely that he and Under Secretary of State Smith did not currently intend to go to Geneva.

Finally, Dulles reiterated that the United States attaches great importance to maintaining a united front between France, Britain, and the United States.
Xinhua News Agency, July 14th: TASS New York, July 13th—

Russell, the Washington correspondent of the "New York Herald Tribune," pointed out in commenting on Dulles's so-called "sudden" trip to Paris that the alliance between the United States, Britain, and France is now "in a state of serious tension."

Russell wrote: "In addition to discussing the critical Indochina issue, Dulles is also prepared to impress upon Mendès France the extreme importance the United States attaches to France's early ratification of the European Defense Community treaty in order to rearm West Germany within the framework of the Six-Nation European Army. Dulles made the decision to go to Paris on the morning of July 12th during an unannounced meeting with Eisenhower at the White House. Moments later, John Johnson, the U.S. Ambassador to Czechoslovakia who is leading the U.S. delegation in Geneva, received instructions by telephone to arrange for him, Mendès France, and Eden to hold a meeting with Dulles in Paris on July 13th."

Russell, in briefly outlining the attitude Dulles will take in his meeting with Mendès France and Eden, pointed out that the United States can only agree to "an armistice that the United States considers 'honorable' and feasible," and that "if the armistice agreement does not meet U.S. requirements, the U.S. government believes it will have to stand outside of such an agreement." Russell continued: "Dulles also intends to find out from Mendès France how France is prepared to strengthen its forces in Indochina and how to strengthen its combat power there if the armistice negotiations break down."

Schmidt, the Washington correspondent for "The New York Times," expressed the same view regarding Dulles's attitude.

An editorial in "The New York Times" said that the purpose of Dulles's meeting with Mendès France and Eden is to restore a common front, which was very solid at the Berlin Conference, but collapsed on the eve of the Geneva Conference.

"The New York Times" bluntly stated that Dulles intends to force Britain and France to pursue the American policy on the Indochina issue. The newspaper said that the problem is to keep the plans of Britain and France within the norms of American policy.

    杜勒斯离华盛顿前表示
    要强迫法英接受美国的观点
    【新华社十四日讯】塔斯社华盛顿十三日讯：美国国务卿杜勒斯在七月十二日下午离华盛顿飞往巴黎，去同法国总理孟戴斯—弗朗斯和英国外交大臣艾登举行一次会议。会议将在七月十三日举行。杜勒斯在离开华盛顿以前发表了一个谈话。这个谈话表明：美国正在进行一种新的努力，要强迫法国和英国接受美国对印度支那问题和其他问题的观点。杜勒斯指出，他这次旅行是由于美国对印度支那和欧洲的事态发展深切关怀。他说，美国正尽力设法使法国、英国和美国采取一致的行动。
    杜勒斯曾经表示过美国的统治集团对于和平解决印度支那问题并不发生兴趣，而日内瓦会议的目的却正是要和平解决印度支那问题。他说，他这次巴黎之行并不是放弃了以前所表示的立场，就是：他和副国务卿史密斯目前都不打算到日内瓦去。
    最后，杜勒斯再一次声明：美国非常重视保持法国、英国和美国的一致的战线。
    【新华社十四日讯】据塔斯社纽约十三日讯：
  “纽约先驱论坛报”驻华盛顿记者鲁塞尔在评论他所谓杜勒斯“突然”前往巴黎一事时指出，美国、英国和法国的联盟现在已“处于严重的紧张状态”。
    鲁塞尔写道：“除了讨论危急的印度支那问题之外，杜勒斯还准备使孟戴斯—弗朗斯深切了解美国极端重视法国早日批准欧洲防务集团条约以便在六国欧洲军的范围内重新武装西德。杜勒斯是在七月十二日上午在白宫和艾森豪威尔举行的一次未经宣布的会谈上作出前往巴黎的决定的。顷刻之后，在日内瓦率领美国代表团的美国驻捷克斯洛伐克大使约翰逊在电话中接到指示，要他和孟戴斯—弗朗斯及艾登进行安排，以便他们在七月十三日在巴黎和杜勒斯举行会议。”
    鲁塞尔在简述杜勒斯将在跟孟戴斯—弗朗斯及艾登举行的会议中所采取的态度时指出，美国只能同意“美国认为是‘光荣’和可以实行的那种停战”，“如果停战协定不能满足美国的要求，美国政府认为它将不得不置身于这种协定之外”。鲁塞尔继续写道：“杜勒斯还打算从孟戴斯—弗朗斯方面弄清楚，如果停战谈判破裂的话，法国准备如何加强它在印度支那的兵力，以及如何加强它在那里的作战力量。”
      “纽约时报”驻华盛顿记者施密特对于杜勒斯的态度也表示了同样的看法。
      “纽约时报”的社论说，杜勒斯和孟戴斯—弗朗斯及艾登举行会议的目的是要恢复共同阵线，这种阵线在柏林会议时非常巩固，然而在日内瓦会议前夕却崩溃了。
      “纽约时报”露骨地说，杜勒斯打算强使英国和法国奉行美国关于印度支那问题的政策。这个报纸说，问题在于使英国和法国的计划不超出美国政策的规范之外。
