    Shijiazhuang Railway Transportation Bureau
    Successfully Trials Double-Locomotive Traction of Freight Trains
    The Shijiazhuang Railway Transportation Bureau of the Ministry of Railways has successfully trialed double-locomotive traction of freight trains. In two trial runs in mid-February, the average tonnage per train exceeded the tonnage pulled by a single locomotive by more than double. Since April, the Shijiazhuang Railway Transportation Bureau has officially implemented double-locomotive traction for freight trains, significantly increasing transportation capacity. Currently, the number of empty and loaded trains departing from Shijiazhuang Station to the Taiyuan Railway Bureau each day has increased by 40% compared to the past. At the same time, freight revenue has also greatly increased. Based on the lowest coal transportation rates, freight revenue has increased by more than 6.3 billion yuan.

    石家庄铁路运输分局
    试行双机牵引货车成功
    铁道部石家庄铁路运输分局试行双机牵引货物列车成功。二月中旬两次试运，平均每列车都超过原来一台机车牵引时的吨数一倍以上。四月份起，石家庄铁路运输分局正式实行双机牵引货物列车，运输能力随着显著提高。现在单石家庄站每天开往太原铁路管理局的空、重车就比过去提高百分之四十。同时，也大大增加了运费收入。以运费最低的运煤价格计算，就增加运费收入达六十三亿余元。
