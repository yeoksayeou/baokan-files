In Guizhou Province this year, most areas have experienced a bumper wheat harvest. After drying and cleaning the new wheat, the vast number of farmers are eagerly selling it to the state. The amount of wheat purchased throughout the province in May increased eightfold compared to the same period last year. In June, in key market towns in Anshun, Puding, Zhenyuan, Zunyi, and Suiyang counties, each market generally had 10,000 to 20,000 jin of wheat available.

Before the commencement of the unified purchase of wheat, grain departments in various locations carried out preparations for wheat storage and studied relevant policy documents regarding the unified grain purchase. During the wheat purchasing process, all areas conscientiously implemented the state's price policies. It is estimated that after selling wheat to the state this year, farmers in Guizhou Province will earn 970 million yuan more than they would have through transactions on the free market last year, enough to purchase 30,000 zhang of fine cloth or 476,000 jin of salt.

During this period, grain departments in various locations paid attention to strengthening the supply of other grain types. Some farmers, after selling their wheat, were able to conveniently buy back some rice and coarse grains.

    贵州省农民踊跃卖小麦给国家
    今年贵州省大部地区小麦丰收。广大农民把新小麦晒干、扬净以后，踊跃地卖给国家。五月份全省收购小麦的数量，比去年同期增加八倍。六月间，安顺、普定、镇远、遵义、绥阳等县重点场镇，每场一般都有一两万斤小麦上市。
    在小麦统购工作展开以前，各地粮食部门都进行了小麦入仓的准备工作，并学习了有关粮食统购工作的政策文件。收购小麦工作中，各地都认真贯彻了国家的价格政策。预计今年贵州省农民卖小麦给国家以后，将比去年在自由市场上成交多得九亿七千多万元，可购买三万丈细布或四十七万六千斤食盐。
    各地粮食部门在这个期间注意加强了其他粮种的供应工作。有些农民卖出小麦以后，又很方便地买回了一些大米和杂粮。
