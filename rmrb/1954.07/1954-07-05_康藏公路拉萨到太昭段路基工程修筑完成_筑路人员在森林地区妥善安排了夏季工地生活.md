Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, July 4th: The roadbed construction of the Lhasa to Tatsienlu section of the western part of the Kangding-Tibet Highway has been completed. The first phase of the eastern section is also progressing.

Construction of the western section of the Kangding-Tibet Highway began in mid-March of this year. Encouraged by the enthusiasm to open Lhasa to traffic as soon as possible, the road construction workers completed most of the remaining project of the Lhasa to Tatsienlu section of last year within three months. Now, the road construction army is heading towards the relatively open and flat river valley area east of Tatsienlu to carry out the second phase of construction. The first phase of the eastern section is one of the most arduous projects since the construction of the Kangding-Tibet Highway began. During the construction period, the workers overcame the difficulties brought about by the rainy season, and the obstructing quicksand and rocky cliffs have been successively conquered. A section of the construction site, which was filled with blasting sounds all day not long ago, is now busy with traffic. The workers who completed the work ahead of schedule have been transferred to support neighboring units; some workers who have completed the roadbed construction are now carrying out the road surface paving work. The material preparation project for more than 100 bridges along the entire line has also been basically completed. At present, the construction sections in both the east and west sections have entered areas with lower altitudes and good climate, and the average work efficiency of the entire line construction has been improved compared with the prescribed standards, providing a strong guarantee for the timely completion of the construction plan.

Xinhua News Agency, Qamdo, July 4th: The road construction workers of the Kangding-Tibet Highway have arranged a comfortable summer worksite life in the forest areas.

Since the beginning of summer, the worksite homes in the green trees have been decorated even more beautifully. The outside of the "tent village" is surrounded by fences woven with pine branches and wildflowers, and various tender green vegetables grow in the newly opened vegetable garden outside the village. An open-air stage, a basketball court, and a dining hall with a canopy have been built in the village. The green club built with pine branches is filled with various books, pictorials, and recreational equipment. People who have worked hard all day spend their evenings here. On rain-cleared weekend evenings, road construction workers play various musical instruments in these brightly lit "tent villages" and hold open-air dances or sing new programs praising road construction heroes and models.

This year's construction area in the middle section of the Kangding-Tibet Highway is a famous rainy area on the Kangding-Tibet Plateau. It rains eight or nine days out of ten, the ground is humid, and there are many mosquitoes and various poisonous insects. Before the arrival of the rainy season, each construction unit had established a summer hygiene system. Logistics staff successively distributed mosquito nets and other summer supplies to road construction workers; medical staff carried out preventive injections for road construction workers, and also regularly sprayed "DDT" in tents. Road construction workers have built high-rise "sofa beds" with branches, spread yellow sand on the ground, covered the shelves for placing daily necessities with snow-white cloth sheets, and built rain shelters on the tents. Now, even on rainy nights, water flowing under the bed will not affect sleep.

Recently, some of the locally grown vegetables have matured, and the cooks have revised the new menu. Many construction units can guarantee one dish and one soup or two dishes and one soup per meal.

    康藏公路拉萨到太昭段路基工程修筑完成
    筑路人员在森林地区妥善安排了夏季工地生活
    【新华社拉萨四日电】康藏公路西段拉萨到太昭间的路基工程已修筑完成。东段第一期工程也正在向前推进。
    康藏公路西段工程是今年三月中旬开工的。筑路工人们在早日通车拉萨的热情鼓舞下，三个月内便完成去年拉萨到太昭段剩下的大部分工程。现在，筑路大军正开向太昭以东较开阔平坦的河谷地带，进行第二期施工。东段的第一期工程，是康藏公路修建以来最艰巨的工程之一。施工期间，工人们克服了雨季带来的困难，拦路的流砂、石崖已被陆续征服。不久前还是整日响着爆破声的一段工地，现在已来往着汽车了。提前完工的工人们，已调去支援友邻单位；有些完成路基工程的工人们，正进行路面铺砂工作。全线一百多座桥梁的备料工程也基本结束。目前东西两段施工地段都已进入海拔较低的地区，气候良好，全线施工的平均工作效率都比规定的标准提高，给按期完成施工计划提供了有力的保证。
    【新华社昌都四日电】康藏公路的筑路人员们，在森林地区安排了舒适的夏季工地生活。
    入夏以来，绿树丛里的工地之家，被装饰得更加美丽了。“帐篷村”的外面，围上了用松枝和野花编的篱笆，村外新开辟的小菜园里，生长着各种嫩绿的菜蔬。村里修了露天舞台、篮球场和搭着遮棚的饭堂。用松枝搭起来的绿色的俱乐部里面放置着各种图书、画报和文娱器具。经过一天紧张劳动的人们，就在这里度过他们的傍晚。雨过天晴的周末的夜晚，筑路人员们就在这些灯火明亮的“帐篷村”里奏着各种乐器，举行露天舞会或演唱歌颂筑路英雄、模范的新节目。
    今年康藏公路中段的施工区，是康藏高原上著名的多雨地区。十天有八、九天下雨，地面潮湿，蚊子和各种毒虫也比较多。在雨季到来之前，各施工单位已建立了夏季卫生制度。后勤工作人员陆续把蚊帐等夏季用品发给筑路人员；医务工作人员为筑路工人进行了防疫注射，还定期在帐篷里喷洒“滴滴涕”。筑路人员们都用树枝搭起了高架“沙发床”，驻地上铺了黄沙，放置日常生活用具的架子上，盖上了雪白的布单，帐篷上也搭了防雨篷。现在，即使落大雨的夜里，水从床下流过，也不致影响睡眠。
    最近，当地种植的蔬菜，一部分已经成熟，炊事人员们重订了新食谱，很多施工单位都可以保证每餐一菜一汤或两菜一汤。
