    Comprehensive Forest and Field Survey Underway in East China
    Over forty survey teams in the East China region are currently conducting forest and field surveys in various provinces. This year, a total of over 1.3 million hectares of forest and field area are planned to be surveyed, including approximately 800,000 hectares for forest resource surveys and over 500,000 hectares for afforestation land surveys. At present, the survey work of each team is proceeding intensely. The East China Forestry Bureau also organized personnel in late June to inspect and supervise the work in various locations.

    The main survey areas this year are: In Zhejiang, resource surveys are being conducted in eleven counties including Longquan and Jiande, while afforestation land surveys are being conducted in sixteen counties including Jinyun and Pingyang. In Anhui Province, surveys are being conducted in areas such as the Dabie Mountain area and the Huangshan Mountain area. In Fujian Province, surveys are being conducted in the Minjiang River basin. In Shandong Province, in addition to completing surveys of all state-owned forest farms with an area of more than 5,000 mu, surveys are also being conducted in the water source mountain areas of Pingyi, Mengyin, and Yinan. In Jiangsu Province, surveys are being conducted in the mountainous areas of Yixing and Liyang.

    Forest resource surveys require clarifying the area of forest land and the volume of timber reserves, and drawing basic forest area maps and forest type maps on the basis of counties or forest areas. Afforestation land surveys require measuring the area of suitable afforestation land, investigating soil and plant distribution, conducting specific afforestation designs, and drawing basic afforestation maps.

    华东各地全面进行林野调查
    华东区四十多个调查小队，现正在各省进行林野调查工作。本年内共计划完成林野调查面积一百三十余万公顷，其中森林资源调查约八十余万公顷，营林地调查五十余万公顷。目前各队调查工作正在紧张进行，华东林业局并于六月下旬组织力量到各地检查督促。
    今年主要调查地区：浙江的资源调查在龙泉、建德等十一县进行，营林地调查在缙云、平阳等十六县进行。安徽省在大别山山区和黄山山区等地进行。福建省在闽江流域进行。山东省除将面积在五千亩以上国营林场全部调查完毕外，同时调查平邑、蒙阴、沂南等地水源山区。江苏省在宜兴、溧阳山区进行调查。
    森林资源调查，要求弄清林地面积和木材积蓄量，并以县或林区为单位绘制林区基本图和林相图。营林地调查，要求做到测定宜林地面积，调查土壤、植物分布情形，进行具体的造林设计并绘制营林基本图。　（陈午生）
