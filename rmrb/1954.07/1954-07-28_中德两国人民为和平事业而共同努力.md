Premier Zhou Enlai of our country, after attending the Geneva Conference and on his way back home, visited the German Democratic Republic at the invitation of Premier Otto Grotewohl of the German Democratic Republic. Premier Zhou Enlai's three-day visit to Berlin was warmly welcomed by the government and people of the German Democratic Republic, fully demonstrating the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and German peoples.

During their meeting, the Premiers of China and Germany exchanged views on further developing friendly relations between the two countries and on maintaining peace, and issued a joint communiqué. The communiqué stated: "Both sides expressed their determination to continue their policies of international peaceful cooperation and friendship between peoples, to tolerate no foreign interference in the internal affairs of their respective countries and no violation of their national sovereignty, and to spare no effort to work to ease international tensions." The sincere desire and firm confidence expressed by the two Premiers in promoting international peace, friendship, and cooperation are of great significance for maintaining peace in Europe, Asia, and the world.

When Chairman Mao Zedong accepted the credentials presented by the head of the diplomatic mission of the German Democratic Republic to China in June 1950, he said: "Since the great Soviet army crushed Hitler's reactionary state apparatus, the Chinese people have been pleased to observe the development of the German people's democratic movement. Since the establishment of the German Democratic Republic, under the leadership of your President Wilhelm Pieck, marking a turning point in German and European history, the Chinese people have been even more pleased and feel that they have gained a good and powerful friend. Just at this time, the People's Republic of China has been established, the Chinese people's revolution has won a nationwide victory, and our country and your country have quickly established diplomatic relations. There is no doubt that the establishment of diplomatic relations between our two countries will not only make the friendship between our two peoples grow and consolidate, but will also provide a strong guarantee for lasting world peace."

People's China and People's Germany are both at the forefront of the great struggle against war instigators and for the cause of peace. Since the end of World War II, American imperialism has been stepping up the revival of militarist forces in Japan and West Germany as its sinister tools for plotting new wars, increasingly threatening peace and security in Asia, Europe, and the world. However, the people of Asia and Europe, including the people of Japan and Germany, still have vivid memories of the profound human disaster caused by the collusion between Japanese and Hitlerite German fascist aggressor forces in launching World War II, and will never allow American imperialism to support the revival of Japanese and West German militarist forces to create new catastrophes. The founding of the People's Republic of China fundamentally changed the situation in Asia. The Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance between the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union, concluded to prevent the resurgence of Japanese imperialism's aggression, has become a powerful guarantee for peace in Asia and the world. The establishment of the German Democratic Republic is a turning point in European history, and the German people's struggle for the democratic unification of their country is developing victoriously. In recent years, the people of China and Germany, together with the people of the world, have dealt a severe blow to American imperialism's sinister plan to rearm Japan and West Germany.

The Four Foreign Ministers Conference in Berlin failed to reach an agreement on the peaceful settlement of the German question and the establishment of a European collective security system due to American obstruction; but the Geneva Conference it decided to convene has now achieved a major victory in restoring peace in Indochina, paving the way for solving the German question and other important international issues. This proves that peaceful negotiation to resolve international disputes is possible, and that the American policy of strength can and must be defeated. Premier Grotewohl stated that the government of the German Democratic Republic supports the agreement reached at the Geneva Conference on the restoration of peace in Indochina, and believes that this agreement should lead to the continued resolution of the German question through negotiation. This wish of the German people, expressed by Premier Grotewohl, should be sympathized with and supported by the governments and peoples of all peace-loving countries. The joint communiqué of the Chinese and German Premiers welcomed and supported the Soviet Union's proposal in its note to France, Britain, and the United States on July 24, 1954, regarding the establishment of an effective European collective security system, which precisely expressed this common desire.

The Chinese people fully support the attitude expressed by the Chinese and German Premiers towards the Soviet proposal, and will work closely with the German people and with the people of European countries to strive for a negotiated solution to the German question and thwart the American imperialist conspiracy to continue to divide Germany, rearm West Germany, and divide Europe to create a new war. As Premier Zhou Enlai pointed out in his speech at the mass rally in Berlin: "The Chinese people are concerned about peace in Asia and also about peace in Europe. In order to maintain peace in Asia, we advocate that Asian countries should conduct consultations with each other. In order to maintain peace in Europe, we hope that European countries should first consult on the issue of guaranteeing European peace and security. The consolidation of European peace depends on the settlement of the German question. We believe that if all relevant countries have a sincere desire for peace, the German question can be resolved through consultation."

The joint efforts of the Chinese and German people for the cause of peace will further develop the friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries. The friendly cooperation between China and Germany has a bright future in terms of both trade relations and cultural exchanges. The joint communiqué of the two Premiers stated that both sides unanimously hope to deepen the cultural relations between the Chinese and German people and further develop the trade relations between the two countries.

The economic and cultural relations between China and Germany have developed significantly in recent years. Since the implementation of the Sino-German trade agreement in 1951, the volume of trade between the two countries has increased year by year. According to the Sino-German Agreement on the Exchange of Goods and Payments in 1954, the trade volume between the two countries will be further increased. These are all conducive to the peaceful construction and improved economic life of our two countries. The cultural exchange between China and Germany is also of great significance. German industrial production and technological level are world-renowned. Germany has produced immortal geniuses such as Marx and Engels, the founders of scientific socialism and the great teachers of the world's working class. The German people have brilliant achievements in philosophy, science, literature, and art. The Chinese people attach great importance to developing cultural exchanges with the German people. We believe that the peaceful reunification of Germany will play an increasingly important role in promoting the development of trade relations and cultural exchanges between China and Germany.

The expanding trade relations between the People's Republic of China and the German Democratic Republic have aroused the concern of the vast majority of people in West German economic circles, who also eagerly demand the establishment and development of trade relations with our country, which is quite natural. As a result of West Germany's one-sided economic ties with the United States, West Germany has been severely hit by the American economic crisis, causing serious damage to the West German economy. The West German people have every reason to develop trade between East and West Germany and with countries in the peaceful and democratic camp, just as they are striving for closer ties between East and West Germany and the realization of national unification. Based on the principle of establishing trade relations with any country on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, our country is willing to establish and develop trade relations with West German economic circles. Premier Zhou Enlai stated that our government will pay great attention to Premier Grotewohl's proposal regarding the West German economic circles' request to establish trade relations with our country.

Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to the German Democratic Republic and the talks between the Chinese and German Premiers will further develop and consolidate the friendship and mutual assistance and cooperation between the Chinese and German people. The development of friendship between the Chinese and German people will help strengthen the power of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, and will help maintain the cause of world peace.

### 中德两国人民为和平事业而共同努力

    中德两国人民为和平事业而共同努力
    我国周恩来总理在参加日内瓦会议以后返国途中，应德意志民主共和国奥托·格罗提渥总理的邀请，访问德意志民主共和国。周恩来总理在柏林的三天访问中，得到了德意志民主共和国政府和人民的热烈欢迎，充分显示了中、德两国人民之间的牢不可破的友谊。
    中、德两国总理在会见中，曾就进一步开展两国间的友好关系及维护和平的问题交换了意见，并发表了会谈公报。公报说：“双方表示，坚决继续国际和平合作和人民友好的政策，不容忍外国干涉它们各自的国家的内政和侵犯它们的民族主权，并愿竭尽全力为缓和国际紧张局势而工作。”两国总理所表示的这个促进国际和平友好与合作的真挚愿望和坚强信心，对于维护欧洲和亚洲以及全世界的和平，具有重要的意义。
    毛泽东主席在一九五○年六月接受德意志民主共和国驻华外交使团长呈递国书的时候说道：“自从伟大的苏军粉碎了希特勒的反动的国家机构以后，中国人民就高兴地注视着德国人民民主运动的发展。自从德意志民主共和国，在贵国总统威廉·皮克先生领导之下建立起来，成为德国历史和欧洲历史的转折点以后，中国人民就更加高兴，感觉自己增加了一个很好的和有力的朋友。恰好在这种时候，中华人民共和国已经建立，中国人民革命已经获得了全国的胜利，我国和贵国就迅速地建立了外交关系。毫无疑义，贵我两国外交关系的建立，不但将使贵我两国人民之间的友谊日益发展与巩固，并且将使世界持久和平得到强有力的保障。”
    人民的中国和人民的德国同处在反对战争挑拨者、维护和平事业的伟大斗争的最前线。自从第二次世界大战结束以来，美帝国主义一直在加紧复活日本和西德的军国主义势力，作为它阴谋发动新战争的罪恶工具，日益严重地威胁着亚洲和欧洲以及全世界的和平与安全。但是，亚洲和欧洲的人民，包括日本和德国人民在内，对于过去日本和希特勒德国法西斯侵略势力相互勾结，发动世界大战所造成的人类的深重灾难，记忆犹新，决不能容许美帝国主义扶植日本和西德军国主义势力制造新的浩劫。中华人民共和国的成立，从根本上改变了亚洲的形势。中华人民共和国和苏联为了防止日本帝国主义重起侵略而缔结的友好同盟互助条约，成了亚洲和世界和平的有力的保障。德意志民主共和国的成立则是欧洲历史的转折点，德国人民争取自己的国家的民主统一的斗争正在胜利发展。这几年来，中、德两国人民和全世界人民在一起给了美帝国主义重新武装日本和西德的罪恶计划以严重的打击。
    在柏林举行的四国外长会议，曾因美国的阻挠而未能就和平解决德国问题及建立欧洲集体安全体系问题取得协议；但它所决定召开的日内瓦会议，现在已谋得了恢复印度支那和平的重大胜利，为解决德国问题及其他重要国际问题铺平了道路。这证明了和平协商解决国际争端是可能的，美国的实力政策是可以而且必须被击败的。格罗提渥总理表示，德意志民主共和国政府支持日内瓦会议关于恢复印度支那和平问题所达成的协议，并认为这个协议应导致继续以协商方式解决德国问题。格罗提渥总理所表达的德国人民的这个愿望，应该受到爱好和平的各国政府和人民的同情和支持。中、德两国总理会谈公报对于苏联在一九五四年七月二十四日致法、英、美三国照会中提出的关于建立有效的欧洲集体安全体系的建议，表示欢迎和支持，正表达了这种共同的愿望。
    中国人民完全支持中德两国总理对苏联建议所表示的态度，并将与德国人民紧密合作，和欧洲各国人民一起，争取以协商方式解决德国问题，挫败美帝国主义继续分裂德国、重新武装西德和分裂欧洲制造新战争的阴谋计划。正如周恩来总理在柏林市群众大会上的演说中所指出的：“中国人民关心亚洲的和平，也关心欧洲的和平。为了维护亚洲的和平，我们主张亚洲国家之间应该进行协商，为了维护欧洲的和平，我们希望欧洲国家之间应该首先就保障欧洲和平和安全问题进行协商。欧洲和平的巩固有赖于德国问题的解决。我们认为，如果各有关国家都具有和平诚意，德国问题是可以经过协商获得解决的。”
    中德两国人民共同为和平事业而作的努力，将使两国的友好合作关系更进一步地发展起来。中德
  两国的友好合作，无论就贸易关系和文化交流各方面来说，都具有远大的前途。两国总理会谈公报表
  明，双方一致希望加深中德人民间的文化关系，并
  把两国的贸易关系再加以发展。
    中、德两国间的经济和文化关系，近几年来已经有了显著的发展。自一九五一年执行中德贸易协定以来，两国间的贸易数额逐年增长。根据两国一九五四年交换货物与付款协定，两国贸易额又有进一步的增加。这些都有助于我们两国的和平建设和经济生活的向上。中德两国间的文化交流，也有很大的意义。德意志的工业生产和技术水平是世界闻名的。德意志曾出现了科学的社会主义创始人和世界工人阶级的伟大导师马克思和恩格斯这样不朽的天才，德意志人民在哲学、科学、文学、艺术各方面都有辉煌的成就，中国人民极为重视发展与德国人民之间的文化交流工作。我们相信，德国的和平统一对于促进中德两国的贸易关系和文化交流的发展，将显示日益重大的作用。
    中华人民共和国与德意志民主共和国日益扩展的贸易关系，引起了西德广大经济界人士的关心，他们也热烈要求建立和发展与我国的贸易关系，这是很自然的。西德与美国的片面的经济联系的结果，已使西德备受美国经济危机的打击，使西德经济遭受严重的损害。西德人民完全有理由发展东西德国之间及与和平民主阵营国家之间的贸易，正如他们争取东西德国之间的接近和实现国家统一的意志一样。我国本着在平等互利的基础上和任何国家建立贸易关系的方针，愿与西德经济界建立和发展贸易关系。周恩来总理表示，我国政府对格罗提渥总理有关西德经济界人士要求建立与我国的贸易关系的建议，当予以极大的注意。
    周恩来总理访问德意志民主共和国和中德两国总理的会谈，将使中德两国人民的友谊和互助合作关系，更加发展和巩固。中德两国人民的友谊的发展，有助于以苏联为首的和平民主阵营力量的增强，有助于维护世界和平的事业。
