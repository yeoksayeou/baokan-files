Editor's Note: Establishing a sound labor organization and a rational system for calculating labor points to overcome the serious confusion of idling, missed work, and lack of responsibility in production management is the main key to the current agricultural production cooperatives doing a good job in production and continuing to move forward. In order to study and solve this problem, the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government sent a working group to conduct a more in-depth investigation of the Zhangguozhuang, Huangtugang, and Xinzhuang agricultural production cooperatives in Fengtai District, Beijing. This article is the result of this investigation.

The Zhangguozhuang cooperative has 388 households, 651 male and female laborers, and 5,872 mu of cultivated land. The Huangtugang cooperative has 155 households, 229 male and female laborers, and 1,679 mu of cultivated land (including 525 mu of vegetable land). The Xinzhuang cooperative has 23 households, 34 male and female laborers, and 320 mu of cultivated land. The Zhangguozhuang and Xinzhuang cooperatives mainly grow field crops such as wheat, corn, millet, sweet potatoes, and peanuts, and have year-round sideline occupations such as sifting stones and making stone slabs. The Huangtugang cooperative mainly grows vegetables and also grows field crops. Vegetable income accounts for about 70% of the cooperative's total income. The Zhangguozhuang and Huangtugang cooperatives have fully implemented distribution according to labor, and land is not divided for dividends. The Xinzhuang cooperative uses 30% of the annual output as land remuneration, and the rest is distributed according to labor.

The Situation of Labor Organization

The Xinzhuang cooperative divides all the labor force into two groups according to the agricultural season and agricultural and sideline industries. Usually, there is one agricultural group and one sideline group (making stone slabs). When agricultural work is most intensive, both groups engage in agriculture. The groups do not have fixed cultivated areas. Each group has one head and one deputy head to lead the group's work and evaluate work points. The committee responsible for production in the Management Committee (hereinafter referred to as the Management Committee) (two people) assigns farm work to the group according to the small section plan. The members of the cooperative still feel that this method of grouping is convenient.

The Zhangguozhuang and Huangtugang cooperatives, because of the large scale of the cooperatives, require a labor organization form that is adapted to the large cooperatives. Both cooperatives have established production teams, each of which is responsible for a fixed cultivated area, and is equipped with livestock and agricultural implements needed for production.

The Zhangguozhuang cooperative has seven production brigades. The brigade is equipped with one leader and two deputy leaders, who are responsible for making production plans, supervising and inspecting, mobilizing large carts and livestock (the cooperative's livestock and carts are equipped in the brigade, and general agricultural implements are kept by the team), liaising with sideline affairs, educating the members of the cooperative, and solving more important problems. Each brigade is divided into several teams. Each team is equipped with one leader and three deputy leaders, who are responsible for arranging production according to the brigade's small section plan (once every seven days), assigning farm work, inspecting the quality of cultivation, evaluating work points, and educating members of the cooperative. The team leader in charge of overall work, one deputy team leader is responsible for production, one is responsible for recording work points, and one is responsible for safekeeping.

The Huangtugang cooperative has five production teams and one jasmine production group. The production team is divided into two to three groups according to labor, and the groups do not have fixed cultivated areas. The production team is equipped with one leader, one or two deputy leaders, and one statistician. The group is equipped with one head and one deputy head, and one work point recorder. The tasks of the team leader are: managing production, planning and assigning farm work, mastering labor quotas, inspecting the quality of cultivation, and educating members of the cooperative on political ideology and labor discipline. In addition to assisting the team leader in his work, the deputy team leader is also responsible for odd jobs and statistics of the vegetables to be sold. The statistician is responsible for making labor report forms and production reports, and also manages agricultural implements. The task of the group leader is to assign members of the cooperative to farm work according to the tasks assigned by the team leader and lead the work. The group work point recorder is responsible for recording the daily work points of the members of the cooperative in the labor handbook.

Experience in Establishing Labor Organizations

1. A sound labor organization and the implementation of a responsibility system are effective methods to overcome waste and inefficiency. The cooperative is a unified production unit. If the previous method of temporary dispatch and decentralized management is still used, it will inevitably lead to waste of labor, affect the production enthusiasm of the members of the cooperative, and cause losses in production. For example, the Huangtugang cooperative developed to 33 households in 1953, and still adopted the method of the cooperative chairman dispatching labor. As a result, it took about half an hour to dispatch labor every morning, wasting two or three workdays every day. The members of the cooperative said that "every day the clock rings for the cooperative to 'attend a meeting' and listen to the chairman's 'allocation'." The chairman in charge of production was just like the members of the cooperative said, "With three heads, six arms, and eight legs, he can't 'handle' it all." Situations often occur where more labor is needed but less is dispatched, or less labor is needed but more is dispatched. Some work that should be done is not done or not done well. In the spring of that year, even 20 ridges of cold leeks were not harvested for one crop because they were too busy. Later, the cooperative inspected these shortcomings, improved the labor organization, and divided all the labor into two mixed male and female production teams, each of which was responsible for a fixed cultivated area. As a result, each team was responsible for a small area, with fewer laborers, and the plots of land were more concentrated. "Dispatching labor" and "dispatching work" were more convenient, and the phenomenon of "idling" and "dropping work" was greatly reduced. The chairman was no longer in a hurry, the team leader took responsibility, and the members of the cooperative no longer complained about "allocation," completely reversing the previous chaotic situation.

Although the Zhangguozhuang cooperative established production brigades and teams at the beginning of this spring, confusion occurred for a time because the division was not appropriate enough and the division of responsibility system was not well defined. On the one hand, the production teams were too small, and the technical backbone was not fully equipped. When planting field crops, many teams had people to hold the plow, but no one to sow seeds; some had people to sow seeds, but no one to spread manure, resulting in a temporary large-scale transfer of labor, which affected the production plan and work quality, and also increased the difficulty of evaluating work points (the cooperative often draws more than half of the male labor force to engage in the sideline occupation of sifting stones, which also makes each production team feel short of people and causes a temporary large-scale transfer of labor). On the other hand, the team leaders did not take responsibility, which made the brigade leaders too busy. The brigade leaders were busy arranging production, assigning farm work, mobilizing livestock and carts, preparing agricultural implements and seeds, and leading the evaluation and recording of work points, etc. They did not have time to actively inspect work and solve important problems, resulting in frequent waste of labor and inefficiency. The brigade leaders themselves were also rarely able to participate in production. Later, the cooperative improved the labor organization, merged the 20 production teams of the four larger brigades into eight, fixed the cultivated areas of the teams, implemented the division of responsibility system, and strengthened the responsibility of the team leaders, which overcame the past chaotic phenomenon and made everyone feel satisfied.

2. The form of labor organization should be determined according to the size of the cooperative, production needs, labor force, and other conditions. According to the experience of the three cooperatives, for cooperatives with less than 30 households, it is better for the Management Committee to directly lead production, and it is generally not necessary to establish production teams with fixed cultivated areas, but production groups should be established according to production needs. For cooperatives with more than 30 households, it is necessary to establish production teams with fixed cultivated areas. The production team is the basic form of labor organization in the cooperative, and it is necessary to select and assign strong backbone members to serve as team leaders to strengthen the team's leadership and give play to its role in production. Below the production team, production groups can be established (if the production team is small, fixed production groups may not be established, and temporary groups can be formed according to small sections of farm work). Production groups do not need to have fixed cultivated areas for many years like production teams, but responsibility areas can be divided within a year or a certain season. This can better implement the responsibility system. For example, when weeding seedlings, if several rounds of seedlings in a certain plot of land are all the responsibility of one group, it is easy to do a careful job every time; if several groups are responsible, it is easy for those who weed first to ignore those who weed later, resulting in a rough job. After dividing the groups, education on collectivism and labor discipline should be strengthened so that members of the cooperative consciously obey the distribution and overcome localism.

In order to strengthen the leadership of the Management Committee and give play to the role of the production team, the levels of labor organization in large cooperatives should not be too many. A cooperative with 300 to 400 households can set up more production teams, and the scale of the teams can be larger. Generally, no additional levels should be added between the production team and the production group (the Zhangguozhuang cooperative has teams under the brigade, and no groups under the team. If the team is large, more team leaders can be set up to divide the leadership).

In general, the establishment of a production team should pay attention to: (1) Appropriately match the labor force, technical backbone, and leadership backbone of each team to enhance its ability to carry out production independently. Appropriate consideration can also be given to the personal feelings and personnel relationships between members of the cooperative, but it must be insisted that production is the main thing, avoiding the concentration of strong labor and backbone, which will affect the production of other teams. (2) Equip each team with livestock and agricultural implements according to production needs. For example, each team in the Huangtugang cooperative is equipped with appropriate livestock and agricultural implements, and the Zhangguozhuang cooperative is equipped with livestock and carts in the brigade, and general agricultural implements such as plows, iron shovels, and large hoes are equipped in the team. (3) Concentrated residence. The division of production teams in the two cooperatives takes into account the distribution of natural villages.

From the situation of the Zhangguozhuang and Huangtugang cooperatives, the production team must be able to put together a production team, be able to independently use a set of agricultural implements, and independently carry out various agricultural activities. The cultivated area of the team should be convenient for implementing rational crop rotation. The production team of a large cooperative should be appropriately increased as the cooperative expands. For example, the current production team in the Huangtugang cooperative has about 40 laborers and 300 to 400 mu of land. This makes it easier to equip livestock and agricultural implements, plant according to local conditions, and rationally use labor to give play to the superiority of the cooperative. However, the scale of the production team should not be too large, because the management ability of the general production team leader is not high, and the agricultural implements used are mainly improved agricultural implements or old agricultural implements. If the production team is too large, it will increase the difficulty of managing production.

3. The cultivated area responsible for the production team should not only pay attention to making the land contiguous and concentrated, but also pay attention to appropriately matching various crops and adjusting busy and slack seasons. The land of each production team in the Zhangguozhuang and Huangtugang cooperatives is close to the natural village where each team is located and is relatively concentrated, and consideration has also been given to matching land and crops and adjusting busy and slack seasons. However, some problems have also occurred. For example, when the Huangtugang cooperative started to compile production teams and divide cultivated areas at the beginning of this spring, each laborer in the cooperative should bear 3.067 mu of paddy fields and 6.082 mu of dry land. However, each laborer in the second team had an average of 5.7 mu of paddy fields and 9.9 mu of dry land, which was too much higher than the average of the cooperative; the fourth team had an average of 2.136 mu of dry land per laborer, and the third team had an average of 1.795 mu of paddy fields per laborer, which was too far from the average of the cooperative. Because the number of laborers and the amount of land did not match, a large amount of labor was transferred. Later, the cultivated area was readjusted to make the number of paddy and dry land borne by each laborer in each team roughly equal, but the contradiction of crop matching occurred again. The third team had 45 mu of small radishes and 35 mu of potatoes, and the fourth team had 81 mu of potatoes and only more than 5 mu of small radishes. Because the number of man-days per mu of small radishes was twice that of potatoes, and the time was concentrated in April and May, while the growing time of potatoes was long and the man-days could be evenly distributed, the third team was busy in April and May, while the fourth team was idle. In addition, the third team did not make a good plan for the use of man-days, and it was difficult to temporarily transfer labor, which caused great losses in production. This shows that the division of cultivated areas must be carefully considered in all aspects, and various contradictions that occur must be resolved according to the principle that the secondary should be subordinate to the primary in order to be appropriate.

4. Regarding the organization of female labor, the experience of the three cooperatives is that it is better to form teams (groups) with mixed male and female labor. This is convenient for matching labor when cultivating and giving play to expertise. For example, when planting peanuts, male laborers hold the plow and female laborers dot the seeds. When planting sweet potatoes, male laborers hold the plow to make ridges, carry water, and spread manure, and female laborers plant seedlings, cover the soil, and spread poisonous grains. It is also convenient to combine agriculture and sideline industries. When agricultural work is not too busy, male laborers can be drawn out to sift stones and make stone slabs, leaving a part of male laborers and female laborers to cooperate in undertaking field work. However, in the case of mixed teams (groups), attention must be paid to the flexible use of labor. For example, men and women can be together when planting field crops, and women can also be separated for work that is suitable for women to do alone, such as hoeing seedlings, picking cotton, and bundling small radishes.

The Situation Before the Implementation of the Piece-Rate Wage System

In the past, the evaluation and recording of labor points for members of the cooperative in these three cooperatives all adopted the method of "fixed points and flexible evaluation." However, with the expansion of the cooperative and the increase in labor and land, various agricultural activities have become much more complicated than before. For example, in the Zhangguozhuang and Huangtugang cooperatives, each production team is divided into several groups to work during the day. No one knows how well they are doing except for the few people who work together; even if they work together, because there is no standard for evaluation, not only does it take a lot of time to evaluate at night, but it is also difficult to evaluate accurately. In this way, some backward members of the cooperative "take advantage of loopholes," "drag their feet" and "endure the sun" while working, and when evaluating work points, they clamor that they have done more work and are tired, and want to evaluate more points. Because some members of the cooperative have not been able to establish a sense of ownership all at once, they think: "If someone does not do well, everyone will suffer. How much can it be when it is my turn? It is not worth offending people." Therefore, they agree to evaluate as much as others say. There are also some people who evaluate work points based on who they are. They propose to evaluate more points for those who have good feelings with them, and agree to evaluate fewer points for those who have bad feelings with them. This inevitably leads to disputes and quarrels. Others may not say anything, but they are secretly angry. This makes those who are active in labor and those who do a good job suffer. As a result, those who are active in labor are no longer active, and those who do a good job are not as good as they used to be. Some members of the cooperative have even lost confidence in running the cooperative well, greatly reducing labor efficiency. On the other hand, because there is no clear standard for evaluation, it is easy to have an imbalance in the evaluation of work points between teams, causing mutual suspicion. All of this has affected the consolidation of the cooperative. Before the Huangtugang cooperative implemented the piece-rate wage system last year, 50 or 60 laborers gathered together every night to evaluate work points, always arguing about who should get more or less, sometimes arguing for half the night. The members of the cooperative reflected: "We are exhausted during the day, and we still have to 'stay up all night' at night, which is really unbearable." At the beginning of this spring plowing, the Zhangguozhuang cooperative stipulated that 7 points for a day's work was the full score, and then it was raised to 7.5 points. At first, the phenomenon of arguing and quarreling over work points was very serious when evaluating work points every night. Later, when each team evaluated work points, except for women and children who were evaluated fewer points, they were generally evaluated full points. Sometimes children also argued for work points, and as a result, many children were also evaluated full points. Therefore, many members of the cooperative were not enthusiastic about labor. They said: "Whether you work or not, it's 7.5 points." One member of the cooperative fell asleep on the edge of the field when pressing the ground; some who delivered manure only loaded half a cart; those who engaged in the sideline occupation of sifting stones only carried one cubic meter of stones a day, while individual households could carry two cubic meters, with an efficiency difference of one time. The Xinzhuang cooperative had the same situation in terms of evaluating and recording work points.

How to Implement the Piece-Rate Wage System

Now, the three cooperatives have all implemented the piece-rate wage system (referred to as "piece-rate system"). This spring, the Huangtugang cooperative planned to implement the piece-rate wage system for 63 kinds of farm work, and 50 kinds have already been implemented. The Zhangguozhuang cooperative initially studied by the team leader meeting and planned to implement the piece-rate wage system for 90 kinds of agricultural work and 7 kinds of sideline work, and a total of 25 kinds have been implemented. The Xinzhuang cooperative conducts experiments before doing certain work with the season, and then implements it. A total of 13 kinds were implemented in the spring plowing and planting stage.

To implement the piece-rate system, it is first necessary to formulate accurate work quotas and determine fair and reasonable work points for each work quota. The three cooperatives followed the following methods when formulating work quotas and determining quota work points:

1. The standard for formulating quotas: The three cooperatives all use the amount and quality of work that an average laborer can achieve in one day of loyal labor as the standard. The method of determining is to first discuss it by the Management Committee, then conduct on-site experiments, and then submit it to the members' congress or team leader meeting for discussion and approval. For example, when the Huangtugang cooperative started to formulate quotas last year, Director Yin Weichen personally participated in the on-site experiment. Before the Zhangguozhuang cooperative implemented quota management, two people cut grass, and the quality standard was stipulated as 5 minutes long, and cutting 400 catties a day was the full score. The members of the cooperative also complained that the quota was too high. After Wang Wenyu, the leader of the fourth brigade, personally experimented, he cut 460 catties in the same labor time while maintaining the quality standard. Finally, after discussion by the members of the cooperative, it was determined that 500 catties was a quota. There are also some simple tasks that do not need to be experimented, and the quota standard can be determined based on the experience of the members of the cooperative. In the same kind of farm work, the quota standard should also be different due to different conditions. For example, the Xinzhuang cooperative stipulates that planting peanuts with a plow on flat land is 12 to 13 mu, and planting millet with a plow on sloping land is 10 to 11 mu, which is a quota. The Huangtugang cooperative stipulates that cultivating land with a 7-inch plow, one donkey and one mule cultivates 5.5 mu a day, cultivating 6 mu with two mules with a 10-inch plow, and cultivating 10 mu a day with three mules with a double-share plow, which is considered a quota. In order to avoid overworking the livestock, it is stipulated that more cultivation will not be recorded more points. After the implementation of quota management, the requirements for cultivation quality have also been stipulated more clearly and meticulously. The Xinzhuang cooperative stipulates that when planting seeds, the seeds should be spread evenly and straight; those who help with the hoe are not allowed to beat the livestock randomly, and they should be fast at the end of the field and stable when turning around, and should not let the livestock eat poisonous grains; those who spread manure should spread it in the ditch, spread it evenly, and are not allowed to spread it in a lump; those who pull the roller should press it well, break the clods, and pick up the stubble.

2. The basis for determining the work points of the quota. The three cooperatives determine the level of work points for each quota according to three conditions: the complexity of the technology, the lightness and heaviness of the work, and the seasonal differences. The Zhangguozhuang cooperative ranks all the farm work of the year and divides it into three grades and eight levels. The first-grade work is divided into two levels. The second- and third-grade work are each divided into three levels. The work points of each level differ by about half a point. The first-grade first-level work is technical and relatively heavy work, such as holding the plow, spreading seeds, spreading manure, hoeing the ground, cutting wheat, cutting grain, driving carts, etc., a total of 30 kinds. If the prescribed quantity and quality are achieved, 8 work points will be recorded in spring, 10 work points will be recorded in summer and autumn, and 7 work points will be recorded in winter. The third-grade third-level work is not only light and easy to do, but also does not require technology, such as seed selection, pest control, and thinning of hemp seeds. If the prescribed quantity and quality are achieved, 5 work points will be recorded in spring and 6 work points will be recorded in summer and autumn. If the same kind of work must be done by several people together, different work points will be stipulated according to each person's work. For example, planting spring corn with four livestock and eight people is stipulated to plant 19 mu of land, 5 full laborers (one for holding the plow, one for spreading seeds, two for spreading manure, and one for driving the whip), 8 points for each person; 3 half laborers (one for spreading poisonous grains and two for pulling the roller), 6 points for each person.

3. Revise the quota at any time as conditions change. After the quota is formulated, it is not fixed and unchanged, and it must be revised at any time according to the changes in conditions. Last year, when the Huangtugang cooperative was weeding in the peanut field, it was determined through experiments that each quota was 3 mu, but before it was finished, it rained. Before the rain, there were few weeds, and after the rain, there were many weeds. The original quota could not be implemented, so they reduced the quota to 1 mu according to the amount that could be achieved in actual work. There are also some tasks that change quickly and cannot be fixed quotas, such as picking beans and picking cotton, but they can be used flexibly according to the actual situation in accordance with the quota method. Last year, the Huangtugang cooperative picked beans. At first, only two or three beans could be picked on one seedling, and one person could only pick 65 to 75 catties a day. They calculated 6.5 points for a quota of 70 catties, which was the average amount. The next day, there were more beans, with the least picking 70 catties and the most picking 105 catties, so they raised the quota to 90 catties. On the third day, the beans came down in large quantities, with the least picking 150 catties and the most picking 182 catties, so they raised the quota to 170 catties.

The Benefits of Implementing the Piece-Rate Wage System

After the implementation of the piece-rate system, the labor enthusiasm of each member of the cooperative has been fully developed, and labor efficiency has been greatly improved. Before the Zhangguozhuang cooperative implemented the piece-rate wage system, two people could not cut 400 catties of grass a day. After the implementation of the piece-rate wage system, they can generally cut more than 500 catties. Those who engage in the sideline occupation of sifting stones used to carry one basket with two people, walking slowly, but after the implementation of the piece-rate wage system, some people carry two baskets at the same time and run (because some people get sick from doing this, it has now been corrected), and they can generally earn 11 or 12 points a day. Women who thin millet seedlings and weed generally bring dry food to the fields and do not rest at noon, and some earn 12 points. After the Huangtugang cooperative implemented the piece-rate wage system, many members of the cooperative started early and worked late. Yin Dekuan, a member of the cooperative, went to the fields at 5 o'clock in the morning and cultivated 168 ditches in the morning, earning 7 points. He also earned 8 points for digging potatoes during the day, doing one and a half days of work in one day. Many members of the cooperative reflected: "In the past, we endured the sun, but now we are afraid of the dark."

Secondly, the principle of equal pay for equal work for men and women has been further implemented, fully developing the enthusiasm of women and semi-labor force, and to some extent, solving the problem of cadres spending too much time on work. Before the implementation of the piece-rate system, only two women in the Xinzhuang cooperative participated in labor during the busy farming season, but now the number has increased to eight women who regularly participate in labor. Last year, the Huangtugang cooperative implemented the piece-rate system, and 20 of the 26 female laborers in the cooperative regularly participated in labor. Some male members of the cooperative always felt that women earned more points and were not convinced. Zhang Yuming and other members of the cooperative competed with women to bundle small radishes. As a result, they bundled 600 bundles a day at most, while women bundled 800 bundles at most. They did not say anything. Around the Beginning of Summer, it was the busiest and most labor-intensive period for the cooperative. Small radishes and leeks had to be cut, and potatoes and wheat had to be topdressed, and millet had to be thinned, etc. It was planned to use more than 1,100 work points, but all the labor force in the cooperative could only do 900 work points. Some members of the cooperative said: "We must hire labor," but since then, the cooperative has implemented the piece-rate work system, which has greatly increased the enthusiasm of men and women, and even old ladies and children have participated in bundling small radishes. As a result, they completed the production task on schedule without hiring a single laborer.

Because the piece-rate system is mainly based on individual piece-rate, each person can record as many points as they do. In this way, after cadres handle necessary affairs or their own odd jobs, they can participate in labor at any time, unlike in the past when the points were not convenient to evaluate, wasting all the fragmented time. Therefore, not only can they do more work, but everyone also feels that work is convenient. Last year, the Huangtugang cooperative had five village cadres who often spent time on meetings, but they still averaged 200 workdays per person in eight months.

Thirdly, the evaluation and recording of labor days has been further achieved fairly and reasonably, in line with the principle of distribution according to labor, and it is simple and easy to implement, avoiding the problem of too many meetings. Because the labor quotas for various farm work are mostly determined after field experiments, it can accurately record points according to the actual amount and quality of work of each laborer, overcoming the phenomenon of overestimation, underestimation, and egalitarianism in the past in the recording of points, and thus it is more in line with the socialist principle of "distribution according to labor." On the other hand, because there are work quotas, after the completion of daily work, the group leader and the work point recorder can check the completion of the quota by each person and accurately record the work points. This can eliminate the trouble of evaluating work points in meetings, avoid the phenomenon of arguing and quarreling over work points, and is conducive to unity among members of the cooperative. And because the number of meetings is reduced and the time of meetings is shortened, members of the cooperative can get enough time to rest or use this time to study. Therefore, after the implementation of this system, it has quickly won the support of the members of the cooperative. When the three cooperatives first implemented the piece-rate system, some members of the cooperative still had various concerns, but after persuasion, explanation, and trial implementation, most members of the cooperative actively asked to do "piece work" (they called recording work points by piece "piece work"). Members of the cooperative generally reflected: "This method is good, it saves trouble, produces work, and does not oppress people." (To be continued)

    赵纲　吕鸿才
    编者按：建立健全的劳动组织和合理的计算劳动工分的制度，克服在生产管理工作中发生的窝工、误工、无人负责等严重的混乱现象，是目前农业生产合作社搞好生产、继续向前发展的主要关键。中央人民政府农业部为了研究和解决这个问题，特派了一个工作组到北京市丰台区张郭庄、黄土岗、辛庄三个农业生产合作社进行了一次比较深入的调查，本文就是这次调查的结果。
    张郭庄社共有三百八十八户，男女劳动力六百五十一人，耕地五千八百七十二亩。黄土岗社共有一百五十五户，男女劳动力二百二十九人，耕地一千六百七十九亩（内菜地五百二十五亩）。辛庄社共有二十三户，男女劳动力三十四人，耕地三百二十亩。张郭庄、辛庄两社以种植小麦、玉米、谷子、甘薯、花生等大田作物为主，并有筛石子、打石板等常年副业。黄土岗社以蔬菜为主兼种大田，蔬菜收入约占全社总收入的百分之七十。张郭庄、黄土岗两社已实行完全按劳分配，土地不分红。辛庄社是以常年产量的百分之三十作为土地报酬，其余按劳分配。
    劳动组织的情况
    辛庄社是根据农业季节和农副业情况，将全社劳动力划为两个小组。平时一个农业组，一个副业组（打石板）。农事最紧张时，两个组都搞农业。小组不固定耕作区。每组设正、副组长各一人，领导全组工作和评工记分。社内半月有一小段计划。管理委员会（以下简称管委会）负责生产的委员（二人）按小段计划向小组分配农活。这种分组的办法，社员们还感觉便利。
    张郭庄、黄土岗两社，因为社的规模大，就要求与大社相适应的劳动组织形式。两个社都建立了生产队，每个生产队负责一个固定的耕作区，并配备有为生产所需要的牲畜、农具。
    张郭庄社共有七个生产大队。大队设队长一人，副队长二人，负责作生产计划，督促检查，调动大车牲畜（该社牲畜大车配备在大队，一般农具由小队保管），副业事务的接洽，对社员进行教育及解决较重大的问题等。大队下各设若干小队，小队设队长一人，副队长三人，负责根据大队的小段计划
  （七天一次）安排生产，分配农活，检查耕作质量，评工记分，教育社员等。正小队长管全面工作，副小队长一人负责生产，一人负责记工，一人负责保管。
    黄土岗社共有五个生产队，一个茉莉花生产组。生产队以下，按劳力分为二至三个小组，小组不固定耕作区。生产队设队长一人，副队长一、二人，统计员一人。小组设正副组长各一人，记工员一人。队长的任务是：管理生产，计划和分配农活，掌握劳动定额，检查耕作质量，对社员进行政治思想和劳动纪律的教育等。副队长除协助队长工作外，还管杂活、统计应售出的蔬菜等。统计员负责作劳动报单、生产表报，并兼管农具。小组长的任务是根据队长布置的任务分配社员农活，领导干活。小组记工员负责将社员的每日工分记入劳动手
  册。
    建立劳动组织的经验
    一、健全劳动组织、贯彻责任制，是克服窝工浪费的有效方法。合作社是统一经营的生产单位，如果仍然沿用过去临时派工分散经营的办法，就必然会造成劳动力的窝工浪费现象，影响社员的生产积极性，使生产受到损失。例如黄土岗社一九五三年发展到三十三户，仍然采用社主席派工的办法，结果每天早晨派工，便要耽误半小时左右，每天窝二、三个工。社员说是“每天打钟上社‘赶会’，听候主席‘发配’”。而管生产的主席却正像社员所说的“长三头六臂八条腿也‘忙活’不过来”。经常发生需工多派工少或需工少派工多的情形，有些活该做没做或做的不好，这年春天甚至有二十畦冷韭因为忙忘了一茬没有收。以后社内检查了这些缺点，改进了劳动组织，将全社劳力划分为两个男女混合的生产队，每队负责一个固定的耕作区。这样做的结果，每个队负责的地区小，劳力少，地块比较集中，“派工”“派活”比较方便，“窝工”
  “丢活”现象大大减少了，主席不忙乱了，队长负起责任来，社员不再闹“发配”了，彻底扭转了过去的混乱现象。
    张郭庄社今年春初虽然建立了生产大队和小队，但由于划分得不够恰当，分层负责制没有确定好，也曾一度发生过混乱现象。一方面是生产小队太小，技术骨干配备不全，大田播种时，不少小队有扶耠子的，没有撒籽的；有撒籽的，没有撒粪的，造成临时大量调拨劳力的现象，影响生产计划和工作质量，也增加了评工的困难（该社经常抽出一半多的男劳力去搞筛石子的副业，也是使各生产小队感到人少和造成临时大量调拨劳力的原因）。另一方面，是小队长没有负起责任，使大队长过分忙乱，大队长每天忙着安排生产，分配农活，调动牲畜、大车，准备农具、种子，领导评工记分等，没有时间主动检查工作和解决重要问题，以致经常发生窝工浪费，大队长本人也很少能够参加生产。以后该社改进了劳动组织，将规模较大的四个大队的二十个生产小队合并为八个，小队固定了耕作区，贯彻了分层负责制，加强了小队长的责任，才克服了过去混乱现象，使大家都感到满意。
    二、劳动组织的形式应根据社的大小、生产需要、劳力多少等条件来确定。根据三个社的经验，三十户以下的社，因为规模小，由管委会直接领导生产较好，一般不必建立固定耕作区的生产队，但应按生产需要建立生产小组。三十户以上的社，就有必要建立固定耕作区的生产队。生产队是合作社劳动组织的基本形式，必须选派较强的骨干担任队长，加强队的领导，以发挥它在生产上的作用。生产队以下，可以建立生产小组（如生产队较小，也可以不设固定的生产组，而按小段农活临时分组）。生产小组不必像生产队那样多年固定耕作区，但可以在一年或某一季节内，划分一下责任区，这样做可以更好地贯彻责任制。例如锄苗，如果某一块地的几遍苗，都由一个小组负责来锄，就容易作到遍遍精细；如果分由几个小组负责，就容易发生先锄的不顾后锄的，发生质量粗糙的现象。在划分小组后，应加强集体主义和劳动纪律的教育，使社员们自觉地服从分配，克服本位主义思想。
      为了加强管委会的领导和发挥生产队的作用，大社劳动组织的层次不应过多。三四百户的社可以多设几个生产队，队的规模可以大一些，一般不应在生产队与生产小组之外，再增加层次（张郭庄社是大队以下设小队，小队以下不再分组。小队规模较大的，可多设几个小队长，分工领导）。
    建立生产队一般应注意：（1）适当搭配各队劳力、技术骨干和领导骨干，增强其独立进行生产的能力。对社员间的个人感情和人事关系，也可以加以适当照顾；但须坚持以有利生产为主，避免劳力强的和骨干集中到一起，影响其他队的生产。
  （2）根据生产需要，配备各队牲畜、农具。如黄土岗社各队都配备有适当的牲畜、农具，张郭庄社牲畜、大车配备在大队，一般农具如犁、铁锨、大锄等配备在小队。（3）居住集中。两个社生产队的划分，都照顾到自然村的分布情况。
    从张郭庄黄土岗两个社的情况看，生产队最少要能凑一个生产班子，能独立使用一套农具和独立进行各种农事活动。队的耕作区要便于实行合理轮作。大社的生产队应随社的扩大而适当增大。例如黄土岗社现在的生产队，多是四十个左右的劳力，三、四百亩土地。这样就更便于配备牲畜、农具、因地种植、合理使用劳力以发挥合作社的优越性。但生产队的规模也不宜过大，因为目前一般生产队长的管理能力不高，使用的农具主要为改良农具或旧农具，生产队太大了，就要增加管理生产的困难。
    三、生产队所负责的耕作区，既要注意使土地连片、集中，又要注意适当搭配各种作物，调剂忙闲。张郭庄、黄土岗两社各生产队的土地都距各队所在自然村较近，且较集中，对搭配土地、作物，调剂忙闲也作了照顾。但也发生过一些问题，如黄土岗社今春开始编生产队划耕作区时，全社每一劳力应担负水地三点零六七亩，旱地六点零八二亩，但二队每个劳力却平均有水地五点七亩，旱地九点九亩，超过全社平均数太多；四队每个劳力平均旱地二点一三六亩，三队每个劳力平均水地一点七九五亩，距离全社平均数又太远。因为劳力和土地数不相称，便形成大量调拨劳力。以后重新调整了耕作区，使各队每一劳力所担负的水旱地数大体相等，但又发生作物搭配的矛盾。三队有四十五亩小萝卜，三十五亩土豆，四队有八十一亩土豆，只有五亩多小萝卜，因为小萝卜每亩用工数较土豆多一倍，而且时间集中在四、五两月，土豆生长时间长，用工可以匀开，就形成四、五两月三队忙，四队闲。加以三队用工计划没有作好，临时调拨劳力又发生困难，使生产上受到很大损失。这说明划耕作区，必须周密地考虑到各方面的条件，对所发生的各种矛盾要依据次要服从主要的原则加以解决，才能作到适当。
    四、关于妇女劳力的组织，三个社的经验，以男女混合编队（组）为好。这样，便于耕作时搭配劳力，发挥专长。例如播种花生时，男劳力扶耠子，女劳力点籽。栽甘薯时，男劳力扶犁打埂、挑水、撒粪，女劳力栽秧、覆土、撒毒谷等。也便于农副业结合，农活不太忙时可以抽出男劳力去筛石子、打石板，留下一部分男劳力和妇女劳力配合起来担负田间工作。但在混合编队（组）情况下，须注意灵活运用劳力，如大田播种时男女在一起，锄苗、摘棉花、捆小萝卜等适合妇女单独做的工作，也可以分开。
    实行按件计工制以前的情况
    这三个社过去对社员劳动的评工记分，都是采用“死分活评”的办法。但是随着社的扩大，劳力和土地的增多，各种农活也比以前复杂得多。如张郭庄和黄土岗两个社，每个生产队白天都分成好些个小组干活，谁干的怎样，除在一起干活的几个人外，别人是不了解的；即使在一起干活，因为没有评分的标准，不仅晚上评分要占去很多时间，而且也很难评得准确。这样有些落后的社员，便“钻空子”，干活“磨洋工”、“熬日头”，在评分时，又嚷自己干的活多、活累，想多评些分。由于有些社员的主人翁思想还不能一下子确立起来，他们想：“谁做的不好，吃亏是大家的，轮到个人名下，能有多少，犯不上得罪人。”因此，别人说评多少就同意评多少。还有些人，是看人来评分，和自己感情好的，就提议多评些分，和自己感情不好的，就赞成少评些分，这样就不可避免地要发生争分吵架的情事。另有些社员嘴里虽不说啥，但心里暗自彆气。这样就使劳动积极和劳动好的吃亏，结果是劳动积极的也不积极了，劳动好的也没有以先干的那样好了。有的社员竟失掉了办好社的信心，大大地降低了劳动效率。另一方面由于评分没有明确的标准，也容易发生队与队间评分的不平衡，造成彼此互相猜疑。这一切都影响了合作社的巩固。黄土岗社在去年未实行按件计工以前，每天晚上五、六十个劳动力在一块评工记分，总是你多我少，争执不休，有时一吵就是小半夜。社员们反映：“白天累的筋疲力尽，晚上还要‘熬鹰’，可真受不了。”张郭庄社今年春耕开始，规定劳动一天七分为满分，以后提高为七分半。最初每天晚上评分时，争分吵架的现象很严重，后来各队在评分时，除妇女小孩少评一些外，一般都评满分。有时小孩也争起分来，结果不少小孩也评到满分。因此不少社员劳动情绪不高，他们说：“干不干，七分半。”有一个社员在压地的时候，在地头上睡着了；送粪的有的只装半车；搞副业筛石子的，二个人一天只抬一立方公尺石子，而单干户二个人能抬二立方公尺，效率相差一倍。辛庄社在评工记分方面也有同样情形。
    怎样实行按件计工制
    现在，三个社都已实行了按件计工的制度（简称“计件制”）今年春天黄土岗社预定实行按件计工的有六十三种农活，现在已经实行的有五十种。张郭庄社由队长会议初步研究，预定农业活九十种、副业活七种，实行按件计工，现在实行的共二十五种。辛庄社是随着季节在该做某种活以前，就先作试验，然后实行，在春耕播种阶段，共实行了十三种。
    实行计件制必须首先制定准确的工作定额和确定每个工作定额的公平合理的工分，三个社在制定工作定额和确定定额工分时，是按照以下的办法：
    一、制定定额的标准：三个社都是以一个中常劳动力忠实劳动一天所能达到的工作数量和质量为标准。确定的办法是先由管委会讨论，再经过实地试验，而后交由社员大会或队长会讨论通过。如黄土岗社去年开始制定定额时，即由主任殷维臣亲自实地参加试验。张郭庄社在实行定额管理以前，两个人铡草，规定质量标准是五分长，一天铡四百斤为满分，社员们还嫌定额太高，经过第四大队大队长王文玉亲自试验后，在同样的劳动时间内，保持质量标准，铡了四百六十斤，最后经过社员们的讨论，确定五百斤为一个定额。也有一些简单的活，不经过试验，根据社员们的经验即可确定定额标准。在同一种农活中，由于条件的不同，定额标准也应有所不同。如辛庄社规定：在平地播种花生一付犁耩十二亩到十三亩，在坡地播种谷子，一付犁耩十亩到十一亩，为一个定额。黄土岗社规定：耕地用七寸步犁一驴一骡一天耕五亩五分，用十寸步犁二头骡子耕六亩，用双铧犁三头骡子一天耕十亩，算一个定额。为了避免赶活累坏牲口，规定多耕不多记分。实行定额管理后，对耕作质量的要求，也规定得明确、细致多了。辛庄社规定：播种时撒种的要撒匀、撒直；帮耧的不许乱打牲口，到地头要快、回头要稳，不能让牲口吃了毒谷；摅粪的，要摅在沟里，摅匀，不许一窝一块；拉砘子的，要压好，要打碎圪垃，拣净茬子。
      二、确定定额工分的依据。三个社对每个定额工分的高低，是按照技术繁简、工作轻重和季节差别三个条件确定的。张郭庄社是把全年的农活，进行排队，分成三等八级。一等活分成两级。二、三等活，各分三级。每级活的工分，相差半分左右。一等一级活，是带有技术性和比较重的活，如扶犁、撒籽、撒粪、锄地、割麦、割谷、赶车等，共三十种。达到规定的数量和质量的，春季记八分工，夏、秋二季记十分工，冬季记七分工。三等三级活，不但活轻容易做，也不需要技术，如选种、治虫、大麻籽间苗等，达到规定的数量和质量的，春季记五分工，夏秋两季记六分工。如同一种活必须几个人共同作业，则按每个人的工作，规定不同工分。如种春玉米，四个牲口八个人，规定种十九亩地，整劳力五个（扶犁一人、撒籽一人，撒粪二人，赶鞭一人），每人八分；半劳力三个（撒毒谷一人，拉砘子二人），每人六分。
    三、随着条件的变化随时修正定额。定额制定后，并不是就固定不变了，还要根据条件的变化，随时予以修正。黄土岗社去年在花生地拔草时，经过试验，确定每个定额为三亩，但没有做完，就下了一场雨，雨前草少，雨后草多，再用原来的定额就没法执行了，所以他们根据实际工作所能达到的数量，降低定额为一亩。还有一些活，变化较快，无法固定定额，如摘豆角、摘棉花等，但可按照定额的办法，根据实际情况灵活运用。黄土岗社去年摘豆角，最初一棵秧上只能摘两三个，一个人一天只能摘六十五斤到七十五斤，他们就按中常的数量七十斤为一个定额，记六分五。第二天豆角多一些了，最少的摘到七十斤，最多的摘到一百零五斤，就提高定额为九十斤。第三天豆角大批的下来了，最少的摘一百五十斤，最多的摘到一百八十二斤，就提高定额为一百七十斤。
    实行按件计工制的好处
    计件制实行后，充分地发挥了每个社员的劳动积极性，大大地提高了劳动效率。张郭庄社在未实行按件计工时，两个人铡草一天还铡不到四百斤，实行按件计工以后，一般能铡到五百多斤。搞副业筛石子，过去两个人抬一筐，慢腾腾地迈着方步走，实行按件计工后，有的同时抬两筐，抬上就跑（由于这样做有的人累病了，现已纠正），每天一般能挣十一、二分。谷子间苗带锄草，一般妇女带着干粮下地，午间不休息，有的挣到十二分。黄土岗社实行按件计工后，许多社员都是起早贪晚，社员殷德宽起五更就下地，一早晨就培了一百六十八个沟，挣了七分，白天刨土豆又挣了八分，一天干了一天半的活。许多社员反映：“以前熬日头，现在怕天黑。”
      其次，进一步地贯彻了男女同工同酬的原则，充分发挥妇女和半劳动力的积极作用，并在某种程度上，解决了干部误工多的问题。实行计件制前，辛庄社只有两个妇女在农忙时参加劳动，现在增加到八个妇女经常参加劳动。去年黄土岗社实行了计件制，全社二十六个妇女劳力，经常参加劳动的就有二十个。这个社有些男社员老觉得妇女挣的分多，不服气，社员张玉明等，就曾和妇女比赛捆小萝卜，结果，他们一天最多的捆六百把，而妇女最多的捆八百把，他们才不吭气了。立夏前后，是这个社农忙最紧张、需工最多的时期，小萝卜、韭菜要牧割，土豆、小麦要追肥，谷子要间苗等等，计划要用一千一百多个工，可是全社劳动力全部参加只能做九百个工，有的社员说：“非雇工不可”，但是该社从那时起，实行了计件工作制，大大地提高了男女整半劳动力的积极性，连老太太和小孩子们也都参加了捆小萝卜。结果未雇一个工，也按期完成了生产任务。
    由于计件制是以个人计件为主的，每个人能做多少活，就记多少分。这样干部在处理必要的事务或自己的零活以后，无论什么时候，都可以参加劳动，不像以前因评分不方便，把零碎的时间都浪费了。因此，不但可以多作些工，大家也感到活便。黄土岗社去年有五个村干部，经常开会误工，但他们在八个月中每人平均仍作了二百个劳动日。
    第三、使计算劳动日的评工记分工作，进一步达到公平合理，符合按劳取酬的原则，并且简便易行，避免了开会过多的毛病。由于各种农活的劳动定额，绝大部分是经过实地试验后才确定的，所以它就能够准确地按照每个劳动力实际工作的数量和质量记分，克服了过去在记分上的偏高偏低和平均主义的现象，因而也就更符合于社会主义“按劳取酬”的原则。另一方面由于有了工作定额，在每天工作完了后，由小组长和记工员检查每个人完成定额的情况，便能很准确的把工分记载下来。这样就可以去掉开会评工的麻烦，避免了争分吵架的现象，有利于社员间的团结。并且因为开会的次数少了和开会的时间短了，社员们就可以得到充分的时间休息，或利用这些时间学习。所以这种制度实行后，很快的就得到了社员们的拥护。三个社在乍实行计件制的时候，有些社员还存在着各种不同的顾虑，但是经过说服、解释和试行以后，大部社员就积极要求干“件活”了（他们把按件记工叫“件活”）。社员普遍反映：“这办法好，省事、出活、不屈人。”　（未完）
