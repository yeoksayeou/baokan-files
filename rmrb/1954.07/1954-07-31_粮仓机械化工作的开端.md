The Grain Bureau of the East China Administrative Council has decided to focus on developing the mechanization of grain warehouses in the East China region this year. This is an important measure to gradually reduce the physical labor of grain storage personnel and improve the efficiency and quality of grain storage work. The Bureau has now selected Guangqin Grain Depot in Wuxi City, Jiangsu Province, as a key mechanized warehouse, and Qingdao City in Shandong Province, Wuhu City in Anhui Province, and Shanghai as areas for establishing general mechanized warehouses. In addition, fifteen areas in various provinces with larger tasks, convenient transportation, and industrial power equipment will be equipped with some grain depot machinery.

Currently, the East China grain department has transported grain depot machinery from Northeast China, Beijing, and other places, including two types of domestically produced electric belt conveyors, one Soviet-style and one Polish-style, for parallel and inclined conveying; Soviet-made "Kuzbass" mobile dryers for reducing grain moisture and preventing mold; and a combined grain cleaning machine for removing impurities and grading. Giant dryers and universal grain dryers will also be transported soon. These machines can be used for combined operations or individually for grain processing. In addition to being equipped for key and general mechanized warehouses, these machines will also be equipped for high-moisture areas to process damp grain. (Tao Mingpan)

    粮仓机械化工作的开端
    华东行政委员会粮食局决定今年在华东区有重点地开展粮食仓库机械化工作，这是逐步减轻粮食保管人员的体力劳动，提高粮食保管工作的效率和质量的一项重要措施。该局现已选定江苏省无锡市广勤粮库为重点机械化仓库，选定山东省青岛市、安徽省芜湖市及上海市为创设一般机械化仓库的地区，另外还在各省选择任务较大、交通方便及有工业用电设备的十五个地区，配备一些粮仓机械。
    目前，华东粮食部门已由东北、北京等地运到的粮仓机械有：用于平行输送及斜坡输送的仿苏联式和仿波兰式的两种国产电动皮带输送机，用于降低粮食水分、防止霉坏的苏联制造的“库兹巴斯”流动式烘干机，以及用于清除杂质和分级的一种综合式净粮机。巨型烘干机及万能式粮食烘干机，不久也可以运到。这些机械可以用来进行联合操作，也可单独用来处理粮食。这些机械除配备给重点和一般机械化仓库外，还将配备给高水分地区，用来处理潮粮。　（陶铭盘）
