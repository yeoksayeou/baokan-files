    Japanese Film "No, We Want to Live!"
    to be Screened in Major Cities Across China

    The first Japanese progressive film translated into Mandarin Chinese after the founding of New China, "No, We Want to Live!", will be screened in major cities across the country starting in early August.

    The Japanese film "No, We Want to Live!" was jointly produced by the Japanese progressive film production group Shinsei Eiga and the "Zenshinza" theater company. The film depicts the suffering and hardship experienced by the Mori family, a family of unemployed Japanese workers. After suffering from unemployment and hunger, Mori decides to commit family suicide. However, reality makes Mori realize that he must persevere and live on. The film reflects the deep suffering of the Japanese working people under the military expansion policies and cruel economic exploitation of American imperialism. The Japan Peace Committee awarded the film the "Peace Prize."

    日本电影“不，我们要活下去！”
    将在我国各主要城市放映
    新中国成立后第一部翻译成为国语对白的日本进步电影“不，我们要活下去！”从八月上旬起，将在全国各主要城市放映。
    日本影片“不，我们要活下去！”是由日本进步电影摄制团体日本新星电影制片公司和“前进座”剧团联合摄制的。影片描述一个日本失业工人毛利一家人苦难生活的遭遇。毛利在饱受失业、饥饿生活的折磨后，决定实行全家自杀。但是，现实又使毛利认识到必须坚持生活下去。影片反映了在美帝国主义军事扩张政策和残酷的经济掠夺下，日本劳动人民的苦难深重的生活状况。日本拥护和平委员会曾授予这部影片以“和平奖金”。
