Speech by Dumitru Dumitrescu, Head of the Romanian Cooperative Delegation, at the First Congress of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives on the 22nd.

In his speech, Dumitrescu introduced the great achievements made by the Romanian people under the leadership of the Romanian Workers' Party in the past ten years since liberation on the road to building socialism and in developing the national economy and consolidating the worker-peasant alliance.

Dumitrescu said: The cooperatives of the Romanian People's Republic, based on the theories of Lenin and Stalin and using the rich experience of Soviet cooperatives, have undergone transformation and are now constantly developing. They have become broad mass organizations that truly help the Romanian people create a better life. Romanian consumer cooperatives are promoting the development of urban-rural exchange, supplying the working class with agricultural products and the working peasants with industrial products through an expanding cooperative distribution network. The sales network of consumer cooperatives has expanded year by year, now exceeding nine times the number of cooperatives before August 23, 1944. At the same time, the sales volume of consumer cooperatives in rural areas has also increased significantly. Consumer cooperatives regularly purchase agricultural products from working peasants in order to continuously improve the food supply to urban workers and the raw material supply to socialist industry. Production cooperatives have also made many achievements, promoting the increase in the production of daily necessities.

He also said that in order to celebrate the tenth anniversary of our country's liberation from fascist oppression and the upcoming Second Congress of Consumer Cooperatives of the Romanian People's Republic, the staff of Romanian cooperatives are now striving for new victories in the struggle to increase the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas and to more fully meet the needs of residents.

He stated: We are very pleased to be able to participate in the First Congress of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives. We will better understand and see firsthand the great achievements made by the working people of the People's Republic of China and the cooperatives of your great country in the years since the establishment of the people's government. After we return home, we will certainly introduce the experience of Chinese cooperatives to the staff of cooperatives in the Romanian People's Republic, and we will gladly tell them about the new achievements made by the Chinese people in the struggle to create a happy life.

    罗马尼亚代表团团长杜米特列斯库致词（摘要）
    罗马尼亚合作社代表团团长杜米特鲁·杜米特列斯库二十二日在中华全国合作社第一次代表大会上致词。
    杜米特列斯库在致词中介绍了解放以来的十年内罗马尼亚人民在罗马尼亚工人党的领导下，在建设社会主义的道路上，在发展国民经济和巩固工农联盟方面获得了巨大的成就。
    杜米特列斯库说：罗马尼亚人民共和国的合作社，依据列宁和斯大林的学说，运用苏联合作社的丰富经验进行了改造工作，现在正在不断发展，它已成为广大的群众性的组织，真正帮助罗马尼亚人民来创造更美好的生活。罗马尼亚消费合作社正在促进城乡交流的发展，通过日益扩大的合作社分布网以农产品供应工人阶级，并以工业品供应劳动农民。消费合作社的推销网逐年扩大，现在比一九四四年八月二十三日以前的合作社数量超过了九倍。同时，消费合作社在乡村中的商品销售额也增加了很多。消费合作社经常向劳动农民收购农产品，以便不断改善对城市劳动人民的粮食供应和对社会主义工业的原料供应。生产合作社也取得了许多成绩，它促进了日用品产量的增加。
    他又说，为了庆祝我国从法西斯压迫下解放十周年和即将召开的罗马尼亚人民共和国消费合作社第二次代表大会，罗马尼亚合作社的工作人员，现在正在为增加城乡物资交流和更充分地满足居民需要的斗争中争取新的胜利。
