Xinhua News Agency, July 22nd: Just as the Geneva Conference reached an agreement on restoring peace in Indochina, and the tense situation in Asia and the world further tended to ease, US warmongering groups are intensifying their instigation of the Syngman Rhee group to carry out war preparations, in order to create tension in Asia and obstruct the establishment of Asian peace and security.

According to Western news agencies, Syngman Rhee has decided to lead a group of military leaders to Washington on the 24th to hold talks with Eisenhower, discussing so-called "new measures" for "unifying" Korea. In recent days, Syngman Rhee has been busy holding meetings with his military and political leaders, formulating plans to use force to "unify" Korea, which he will present to Eisenhower. According to sources from the Syngman Rhee group, Syngman Rhee will ask Eisenhower to issue a joint statement by the United States and South Korea, stating that they will "no longer hold negotiations with the Communists on the issue of Korean unification," and will demand that the United States "abolish" the Korean Armistice Agreement and support Syngman Rhee's "northward march" to "unify" Korea by force. Syngman Rhee will also demand that the United States and South Korea sign a military "aid" agreement to expand the South Korean army, navy, and air force, support South Korea in establishing a military aggression group in the Pacific region, and revise the US-South Korea "Mutual Defense Treaty" to clarify the assistance the United States should provide if the Syngman Rhee group restarts a new war of aggression.

US authorities are also busily preparing for the Eisenhower-Syngman Rhee talks. US military authorities will hold a high-level military conference in the next few days. According to Western news agencies, this conference will discuss the US military deployment in the Far East and is "related" to the Eisenhower-Syngman Rhee talks. General Hull, Commander-in-Chief of the US Forces in the Far East, led his Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations, Rogers, to Washington on the 20th to participate in this military conference. US Ambassador to South Korea, Briggs, also rushed from Seoul to Washington on the 19th to "provide clues for discussion (with Syngman Rhee)" to Eisenhower.

At the same time, the Syngman Rhee group is stepping up the expansion of the South Korean puppet army and carrying out military deployments, preparing cannon fodder for its American masters to carry out new aggression in Asia. According to the International News Service, General Taylor, commander of the US Eighth Army in Korea, announced on the 17th that the South Korean Army will establish a training headquarters in August, and then establish a rear headquarters. According to United Press, Ding Yiquan, Chief of Staff of the South Korean Army, has been busy planning the establishment of these two headquarters and transferring the heads of various departments of the army, stepping up preparations for the Syngman Rhee group to launch a new adventure.

    在美国好战集团策划下
    李承晚加紧进行战争准备
    【新华社二十二日讯】正当日内瓦会议达成恢复印度支那和平的协议，亚洲和世界紧张局势进一步趋于缓和的时候，美国好战集团却在加紧策动李承晚集团进行战争准备，来制造亚洲的紧张局势，阻挠亚洲和平和安全的建立。
    据西方通讯社报道，李承晚已决定在二十四日率领一批军事首脑到华盛顿去和艾森豪威尔进行会谈，讨论所谓“统一”朝鲜的“新的措施”。这几天来，李承晚正在和他的军政首脑忙碌地举行会议，制定他将向艾森豪威尔提出的用武力“统一”朝鲜的计划。据李承晚集团的人士透露，李承晚将向艾森豪威尔要求由美国和南朝鲜发表一项联合声明，表示“不再和共方举行关于朝鲜统一问题的谈判”，并且要求美国“废除”朝鲜停战协定，支持李承晚“向北进军”用武力“统一”朝鲜。李承晚还将要求美国和南朝鲜签订一项军事“援助”的协定，扩充南朝鲜陆、海、空军，支持南朝鲜建立一个太平洋地区的军事侵略集团，并且修改美李“共同防御条约”，澄清美国在李承晚集团重新发动新的侵略战争时应给予的援助。
    美国当局也正在忙碌地进行准备，安排艾森豪威尔和李承晚的会谈。美军当局将在最近几天内举行高级军事会议。据西方通讯社透露，这次会议将讨论美国在远东的军事部署，并且是和艾森豪威尔、李承晚的会谈“有关系的”。远东美军总司令赫尔已在二十日率领他的负责作战的副参谋长罗杰斯赶到华盛顿去参加这次军事会议。美国驻南朝鲜的大使布里格斯也已在十九日从汉城赶到华盛顿，向艾森豪威尔“提供（和李承晚进行）讨论的线索”。
    同时，李承晚集团正在加紧扩充南朝鲜傀儡军队和进行军事部署，为它的美国主子在亚洲进行新的侵略准备炮灰。据国际新闻社报道，侵朝美军第八军军长泰勒在十七日宣布，南朝鲜陆军将在八月份内成立一个训练司令部，并且在这以后还要成立一个后方司令部。据合众社报道，南朝鲜陆军参谋长丁一权最近正在忙碌地策划成立这两个司令部和调动陆军各部门的首脑人员，加紧为李承晚集团发动新的冒险进行准备。
