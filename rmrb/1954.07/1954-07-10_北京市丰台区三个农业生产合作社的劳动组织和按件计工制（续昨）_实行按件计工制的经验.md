    Labor Organization and Piece-Rate Wage System in Three Agricultural Production Cooperatives in Fengtai District, Beijing (Continued from Yesterday): Experience in Implementing the Piece-Rate System
    Zhao Gang, Lü Hongcai

    I. The implementation of the piece-rate system must be closely integrated with improving labor organization, establishing a responsibility system, and strengthening planning. The piece-rate system is a method of calculating workdays. If the organization is loose, there is no clear division of labor and responsibility, or the planning is not thorough enough, then the implementation of this system can easily lead to members doing whatever work is beneficial and convenient for them. It can also lead to sloppy work, missed farming seasons, and omissions, causing losses in production. Before implementing the piece-rate system, the three cooperatives, according to their size, leading cadres, labor force, livestock power, production tools, and specific residential conditions, divided into production teams and groups, established a hierarchical responsibility system for the teams and groups, and formulated relatively detailed production plans. The Huangtugang and Zhangguozhuang cooperatives have annual, seasonal, and monthly production plans for the cooperative. In addition to the cooperative's overall plan, each production team and group also develops its own annual, seasonal, and monthly plans (to avoid being cumbersome, monthly plans may be considered unnecessary), as well as small-segment plans every seven days. If the labor organization is found to be incompatible with the piece-rate system, adjustments are made at any time. After improving the labor organization and establishing the responsibility system, strengthening planning so that each production team and group carries out production according to the plan becomes very important. When the third production team of the Huangtugang Cooperative formulated its May plan, it did not include odd jobs, and when harvesting small radishes, there was a great shortage of labor. The other teams were all working according to the plan, and it was difficult to temporarily allocate labor. As a result, not only was the peanut planting and potato weeding delayed, but also the timely harvesting of small radishes was delayed.

    II. To ensure the smooth implementation of the piece-rate system, it is necessary to strengthen political education and emphasize inspection work. After the implementation of the piece-rate system, it is very easy for members to pursue quantity at the expense of quality in order to earn more points. Last year, when the Huangtugang Cooperative harvested peanuts, it stipulated 500 catties as a quota, but at that time, some members pursued quantity, not picking up the ones that fell on the ground, and throwing away the vines without removing all the peanuts, wasting a lot. After the management committee discovered this problem, they held a meeting in the field the next day before picking peanuts, and educated the members, explaining that earning two more points for picking an extra 100 catties would only result in three or four thousand yuan during profit distribution, but wasting 20 catties of peanuts would result in a loss of 20,000 yuan for the cooperative. If the cooperative's total income decreased, even if individuals earned more points, they would not be able to share more money. This method of detailed accounting clarified the unity of individual interests and the interests of the cooperative, and after that, members picked peanuts more carefully, reducing the loss by 20 catties per mu. For example, the cooperative stipulated that hoeing 45 radish ridges was a quota, and the quality requirement was 4 inches deep. Member Chen Dekuan hoed 40 ridges in three hours, which everyone thought was wrong. It turned out that he only used four teeth to rake the surface of the soil, leaving a new mark. Ren Tianyuan leveled the ridges without breaking up the clods, and one day he earned 22 points. As a result, when planting, the water leaked into large holes. Obviously, such pursuit of quantity at the expense of quality, if not corrected in time, would cause great losses in production. Therefore, the cooperative stipulated that the team leader or group leader should conduct a quality inspection before the end of work every evening. The management committee can also organize a large-scale quality inspection by the leading cadres of each team when necessary. Those who do not meet the quality requirements are ordered to rework or have points deducted, and are criticized. Those with good results are praised. In addition, a competition was launched between teams, members were mobilized to supervise each other, and regular visits and comparisons were organized, which made members pay attention to quality.

    After the implementation of the piece-rate system, the members' enthusiasm for labor has greatly increased, but it is also easy to develop拼命主义[Pinyin: pīnmìng zhǔyì; "拼命" means "to exert the utmost strength or energy"] which disregards physical health in order to earn more points. After the Zhangguozhuang Cooperative implemented piece-rate wages for the sideline business of sifting stones, some members increased from carrying one basket between two people to carrying two baskets at a time, and as a result, many members became ill from exhaustion. Luo Chunsheng, a member of the Huangtugang Cooperative, came back from digging the river in the morning and went to work in the field without resting at noon, saying, "I have to 'chase points'!" He earned eight points in the afternoon and fell ill the next day, spending more than one million yuan for a month's rest. Member Hua Chunxiang, in order to "chase points," often said to the members of his team when washing spinach and loading it onto the truck in the spring, "I'll take care of this work." He worked until late at night, and had to get up early in the morning to drive the truck to the market, rarely sleeping for more than a month, and as a result, he was sick for two months. Therefore, after the implementation of the piece-rate system, appropriate work and rest systems should be stipulated, and attention should be paid to educating the members to prevent situations that disregard physical health from occurring.

    III. The piece-rate system should progress from simple to complex. The gradual implementation of the piece-rate system currently lacks a complete and mature set of experiences. Due to a lack of familiarity, members generally have various concerns about adopting this system. Some cooperative cadres and members are afraid of trouble and of not doing a good job. Members with weak labor or who are relatively lazy are afraid of earning fewer points and not being able to take advantage of it. Therefore, when piloting the system, in addition to fully carrying out ideological mobilization work, one should start with simple and easy-to-implement farm work, which is easier for members to accept, and gradually realize its benefits, laying a good foundation for the smooth implementation of this system. Last year, the Huangtugang Cooperative started implementing piece-rate wages from harvesting small radishes, and then gradually increased to 33 types. This year, it has increased to 63 types. Among them, for small radishes alone, there are 15 types of work from land preparation and sowing to harvesting and loading for sale, of which 14 are implemented on a piece-rate basis, which is generally supported by the members.

    The piece-rate system is not very complicated or difficult to handle. In fact, the "contracting" system currently implemented by agricultural production cooperatives in various places includes many types of farm work that are paid on a piece-rate basis. However, the general contracting system is based on "group piece-rate, individual work evaluation," and most of them still cannot avoid the trouble of work evaluation; while the piece-rate system is based on "individual piece-rate," and the amount of farm work that needs work evaluation is reduced, so it is much simpler in terms of point recording. As for the formulation of quotas, it needs to be tested and is not a difficult task. It is impossible and unnecessary to test all the quotas that are to be implemented at once. Instead, the tests are carried out in conjunction with production before the start of each type of farm work, without the need for special effort. At the same time, this system should be gradually promoted from simple to complex and from easy to difficult. Therefore, when implemented, it will not feel very difficult.

    According to the experience of the Huangtugang Cooperative, it is currently difficult to formulate quotas for about 20% of farm work. For example, general odd jobs and replanting seedlings can still use the "fixed point, live evaluation" method. At the same time, in the piece-rate work system, there are still some types of farm work that require "group piece-rate, individual work evaluation." Therefore, it is also wrong to completely abandon the "fixed point, live evaluation" method at once. However, we should affirm that the "fixed point, live evaluation" method has shortcomings. It is only a transitional method. With the development of agricultural production cooperatives and the expansion of the cooperative's organizational scale, it will inevitably be gradually replaced by the piece-rate work system. Some people have the mistaken idea that the piece-rate work system is troublesome. They should actively start with easy-to-piece-rate farm work, formulate quotas, and gradually promote it.

    IV. In the implementation of the piece-rate system, special attention should be paid to the experimental work of quotas, and the method of relying solely on experience to estimate should be minimized, so that the quotas can be fair and reasonable. The three cooperatives all did experimental work one or two days before starting, and then it was approved by the management committee and announced to the members. However, when experimenting, attention must be paid to conducting experiments separately according to different soil types and conditions in order to avoid excessively light or heavy quotas. The fifth production team of the Huangtugang Cooperative has sandy loam soil, which is different from the more clayey soil of other teams. However, when determining the quota, this difference was not taken into account, and separate experiments were not conducted to determine different quotas. Therefore, the team exceeded the quota in various types of farm work such as cultivating land, leveling ridges, hoeing ridges, and pulling radishes, causing dissatisfaction among the members of other teams.

    When formulating quota standards, the three cooperatives all used the work quantity and quality that a medium-strength laborer can achieve in one day of faithful labor as the standard. In the initial stage of the pilot, the cooperative's leading cadres and members lacked experience, and some people had varying degrees of concern. Using a medium-strength laborer as the standard allows strong laborers to exceed it, and weak laborers can also achieve it through effort, which has a certain effect on improving work morale and work efficiency. Therefore, doing so is appropriate. However, as experience increases and members have a deep understanding of this method, the standard of work quotas should be slightly higher than the standard that a medium-strength laborer can complete, in order to stimulate labor enthusiasm and improve labor efficiency. With the improvement of labor productivity, the improvement of production tools, and the progress of members' technical proficiency, the quota standards should also be raised accordingly. Otherwise, it will make it difficult to continue improving productivity.

    The work quantity of each quota should not be arbitrarily raised or lowered due to point calculation. The work quota is not only the basis for calculating labor work points, but also the foundation for planning and organizing labor. According to the quota, the required labor force can be calculated in order to properly allocate the labor force and complete the production work within a certain period of time, so that the production plan is in line with reality. When formulating quotas, the Huangtugang Cooperative reduced the quota work quantity for technical work and heavy work, and increased the quota work quantity for work with poor technical requirements and light work. For example, "leveling ridges" is technical work, and the quality requirements are no water accumulation, no water leakage, and no deflection. It is difficult for people without technical skills to do it well. However, instead of raising the quota work points, they reduced the number of ridges that a medium-strength laborer could level in one day from 50 to 40 to calculate a quota. One workday is recorded for completing one quota, and points are added proportionally when exceeded. Bundling leeks, a medium-strength laborer can bundle 100 bundles a day, but because it is light work, 120 bundles are counted as a quota, and one workday is also recorded for completing one quota, and points are deducted proportionally if it is not reached. In this way, not only does it cause difficulties in planning and organizing the labor force, but it also means that the quota lacks a clear standard. And because some technical work and heavy work have reduced the quota work quantity, it is easy for general laborers to be satisfied after reaching the quota, hindering the play of labor enthusiasm; while for some technical work and light work with poor skills, it is difficult for general laborers to complete a quota after working for a day due to the increased quota work quantity, which also affects their labor enthusiasm. Therefore, it is more appropriate to use the method of raising or lowering work points without changing the work quantity of the quota.

    When determining quota work points, we should overcome egalitarianism and always pay attention to correcting the phenomenon of being too high or too low. The three cooperatives still have more or less egalitarian ideas when determining quota work points. This is reflected in the lack of emphasis on technical work, and the difference in work points between heavy work and light work is also very small. For example, the Xinzhuang Cooperative stipulates that for planting millet, when completing a quota, the person holding the drill (technical work) gets 10 points, the person applying manure (heavy work) gets 10 points, the person covering the soil (light work) gets 10 points, and the person pulling the stone roller (light work) gets 9.5 points. Zhangguozhuang also did not pay enough attention to technical work when arranging farm work. For example, plowing (technical work) and spreading manure (heavy work) were both stipulated as 8 points, while soaking seeds and mixing seeds (technical work) were stipulated as 6 points. Although this is because farmers' old habits cannot be changed for a while, it can also be seen that they have not yet realized the importance of technology in agricultural production and that there is still egalitarianism. Of course, in order to take care of the current situation where manual labor is the main method, the difference in work points should not be too large; but with the improvement of technology and the adoption of new tools, farmers should be consciously educated to correct this incorrect view in order to encourage members to learn technical skills.

    In the process of implementing the piece-rate system, we should always pay attention to correcting the phenomenon of quota work points being too high or too low. In the Huangtugang Cooperative, because there was a difference between
  “sweet work” and “bitter work” in the quotas, member Wang Ligong often rushed to do
  “sweet work.” In March, he earned 140 points in 10 days, causing dissatisfaction among the members. Because the Zhangguozhuang Cooperative did not pay attention to the balance of quota work points during the seasonal transition, on the same day, those who used a plow to make ridges for spring crops earned 8 points, while some women thinning valley seedlings for summer crops earned 12 points, which was obviously unreasonable. In order to correct this phenomenon, larger-scale cooperatives can establish an organization similar to a quota management committee under the management committee to be responsible for the formulation, revision, inspection, and summary of quotas, so as to continuously improve the piece-rate system.

    北京市丰台区三个农业生产合作社的劳动组织和按件计工制（续昨）
    实行按件计工制的经验
    赵纲　吕鸿才
    一、实行计件制必须与健全劳动组织，建立责任制和加强计划性紧密地结合起来。计件制是计算劳动日的一种方法，如果组织松懈，没有明确的分工负责制度，或者计划不够周密，那么实行这种制度就容易使社员们发生什么活对自己有利和方便就干什么活，并且也会发生干活粗糙、错过农时和丢漏农活等混乱现象，使生产上受到损失。三个社在实行计件制以前，都按照规模的大小、领导骨干、劳动力、畜力、生产工具和居住的具体情况，划分了生产队、组，建立了队、组的分层负责制，制订了较周密的生产计划。黄土岗和张郭庄两个社，有社的全年、季节和月度的生产计划，各生产队、组除根据社的总计划订出队、组的全年、季节和月度的计划外（为避免繁琐，似可考虑不要月度计划），并有七天一次的小段计划。如果发现劳动组织与计件制发生不相适应的情况，即随时进行调整。在健全了劳动组织和建立了责任制以后，加强计划性使各生产队、组按照计划进行生产，便显得十分重要。黄土岗社的第三生产队，在制定五月份的计划时，由于没有把零活计划在内，在收小萝卜时劳力就大感不足，其他各队都按照计划进行工作，临时调拨劳力也很困难，这样一来，不但推迟了花生播种和土豆拔草的时间，也耽误了小萝卜的及时收获。
    二、为保证计件制顺利推行，必须加强政治教育，重视检查工作。实行计件制后，社员们为了多挣分，追求数量，不顾质量的现象，是极容易发生的。黄土岗社去年收花生时，规定五百斤为一个定额，但当时有些社员追求数量，摔在地下的不拣，秧子没有摘净就扔，糟蹋很多。管委会发现这一问题后，第二天就在摘花生以前，在地头开会，向社员进行教育，讲明多摘一百斤多得两分，分红时才三四千元，可是糟蹋二十斤花生，社里就损失二万元，社里总收入减少了，个人挣的分再多，也不能多分钱。这样用算细账的办法说明利害，使社员们明了了个人的利益和社的利益的一致性，以后社员们对拣花生就仔细了，每亩可少损失二十斤花生。再如该社规定钎萝卜畦四十五畦为一个定额，质量要求是四寸深，社员陈德宽三个钟头就钎了四十畦，大家觉得不对劲，原来他只用四齿在地皮上搂一搂，搂出新印就算了。任天元钎畦不打碎土块就平，有一天竟挣到二十二分，结果种的时候，用水一浇，都漏成大窟窿。显然这种追求数量不顾质量的现象，如不能及时加以纠正，在生产上就要受到很大损失。因此，该社规定每晚收工前由队长或小组长进行一次质量检查，管委会认为有必要时还可临时组织各队领导干部进行质量大检查。对不合质量要求的，令其返工或扣分，并给以批评，对成绩好的，就给以表扬。此外，还开展了队与队间的竞赛，发动社员间进行互相监督并经常组织各队参观评比，这样就使社员们重视了质量。
    在实行计件制后，社员们的劳动积极性是大大提高了，但也容易发生为多挣分而不顾身体健康的拼命主义。张郭庄社在实行副业筛石子的按件计工后，有的社员由过去两人一回抬一筐增加到一回抬两筐，结果不少社员累病了。黄土岗社社员罗春生，上午挖河回来午间没有休息就下地干活，说：“可得‘奔分’了！”一下午就挣了八分，第二天就病了，歇了一月花了一百多万元。社员花春祥为了“奔分”，在春季作洗菠菜装车的活时，常向本队的社员说：“这活我包了。”一干就是小半夜，早上又得起早赶车上市，一个多月很少睡觉，结果病了二月。因此，实行计件制后，应该规定适当的作息制度，并注意向社员进行教育，防止不顾身体健康情事的发生。
    三、计件制应由简到繁。逐步推行计件制，目前还没有一套完整的和成熟的经验，由于没有习惯，一般社员们对采用这种制度还存在着各种不同的顾虑，如一部分社干部和社员存在着怕麻烦，怕搞不好，劳力弱的和比较懒惰的社员，怕自己挣分少，占不了便宜等。所以在试行的时候，除应充分作好思想动员工作外，应先由简单和容易实行的农活入手，才容易为社员所接受，并逐渐体会到它的好处，为顺利推行这种制度打好基础。黄土岗社去年由收小萝卜开始实行按件计工，以后逐渐增加到三十三种，今年又增加到六十三种，其中小萝卜一项，由整地、播种至收获、装车出售的各种活共有十五种，实行计件的就有十四种，普遍得到社员们的拥护。
    计件制并不是十分复杂难办的。事实上目前各地农业生产合作社实行的“包工”制度，其中不少农活是按件计工的。不过一般的包工制度是以“小组计件、个人活评”为主，大部分仍然免不掉评工的麻烦；而计件制是以“个人计件”为主，需要评工的农活，就减少了，因此在记分上就简便得多。至于定额的制定，需要经过试验，也不是怎样难办的事。因为它不可能也不必要一下子对准备实行计件的定额，都进行试验，而是在每一件农活开始前，结合生产，就试验了，不需要特别费事。同时，这种制度是应该由简到繁由易到难逐步推行的，因此实行起来，便不会感到很困难了。
    根据黄土岗社的经验，目前还有百分之二十左右的农活，制定定额有困难。如一般零活和补苗等，仍然可以采用“死分活评”的办法，同时在计件工作制中，也还有一部分农活需要“小组计件、个人活评”，因此，想一下子就完全抛弃“死分活评”的办法也是不对的。不过我们应当肯定，死分活评的办法是有缺点的，它只是一种过渡的办法，随着农业生产合作社的发展和社的组织规模的扩大，必然要逐步为计件工作制所代替。有些人对计件工作制存在着怕麻烦的思想是错误的。应当主动地先从容易计件的农活作起，制定定额，逐步推广。
    四、在实行计件制中，应特别重视定额的试验工作，尽量减少单凭经验估计的办法，以便使定额达到公平合理。三个社都是在动手前一两天作好试验工作，然后由管委会通过，向社员公布。但在试验时必须注意根据不同的土质和条件分别进行试验，才能免掉畸轻畸重的毛病。黄土岗社第五生产队是沙质壤土和其他各队粘土较多的情况不同，但在确定定额时，没有注意到这一差别，而分别进行试验，确定不同定额，因此该队无论在耕地、平畦、钎畦、拔萝卜等各种农活中，都超过定额很多，引起其他各队社员的不满。
    三个社在制定定额标准时，都是以一个中常劳动力，忠实劳动一天，所能达到的工作数量和质量为标准。这在开始试行的阶段，社的领导干部和社员们还缺乏经验，有些人又存在着各种不同程度的顾虑，以中常劳动力为标准，劳力强的，可以超过，劳力弱的，经过努力也可以达到，对提高工作情绪和提高工作效率，都有一定作用，因此，这样做是适当的。但随着经验的增加和社员对这种办法有了深刻的认识以后，就应使工作定额的标准较中常劳动力所能够完成的标准稍为提高一些，以刺激劳动的积极性，提高劳动效率。随着劳动生产率的提高，生产工具的改进，社员技术熟练程度的进步等情况，定额标准也应随着提高。否则，便会使继续提高生产率发生困难。
    每一个定额的工作数量，不能因计分关系而随意升降。工作定额，不但是劳动工分计算的根据，而且是计划和组织劳动的基础，根据定额可以计算出所需的劳动力，以便适当分配劳动力，在一定时间内，完成生产工作，使生产计划切合实际。黄土岗社在制定定额时，把技术活和重活的定额工作数量降低，而把技术性差的活和轻活的定额工作数量提高，如“平畦”是技术活，质量要求是不顶水、不跑水、不偏扇，没有技术的人是很难做好的。但他们不用提高定额工分的办法，而把一个中常劳动力一天能平五十畦降低为四十畦算一个定额，完成一个定额就记一个劳动日，超过时按比例加分；捆韭菜一个中常劳动力一天能捆一百捆，但因为是轻活，就拿捆一百二十捆算一个定额，也是完成一个定额记一个劳动日，达不到的按比例减分。这样，不但在计划和组织劳动力时发生困难，也等于使定额没有明确的标准。并且由于一些技术活和重活降低了定额的工作数量，使一般劳动力在达到定额后，就容易满足，阻碍了劳动积极性的发挥；而对某些技术差的活和轻活，由于提高了定额的工作数量，使一般劳动力劳动一天又很难完成一个定额，也影响其劳动积极性。因此，不变动定额的工作数量，而用升降工分的办法，比较恰当。
    在确定定额工分时应克服平均主义并经常注意修正偏高偏低的现象。三个社在确定定额工分时，还或多或少地存在着平均主义的思想。表现在对技术活的不够重视，而重活和轻活的工分差别也很小。如辛庄社规定耩谷，完成一个定额时，扶耧的（技术活）十分，摅粪的（重活）十分，覆土的（轻活）十分，拉砘子的（轻活）九分五。张郭庄在农活排队时，对技术活也重视不够，如耕地（技术活）与撒粪（重活）都规定为八分，而浸种、拌种（技术活）却规定为六分。这虽然由于农民旧的习惯一时还不能改变过来，也可以看出他们还没有认识到技术在农业生产上的重要意义和还存在着平均主义的思想。当然为了照顾目前以手工劳动为主的情况，工分差别不应过大；但随着技术的改进和新工具的采用，应有意识地教育农民，改正这种不正确的观点，以鼓励社员们学习技术的积极性。
    在实行计件制的过程中，应随时注意修正定额工分的偏高偏低现象，黄土岗社，由于定额中有
  “分甜”“分苦”的差别，社员王立功经常抢着干
  “甜活”，三月份内有十天他挣到一百四十分，惹起社员们的不满。张郭庄社由于没有注意季节衔接时定额工分的平衡，所以在同一天内，扶犁打埂的作春季活挣八分，而一般妇女间谷苗的，作夏季活有的挣到十二分，这显然是不合理的。为了纠正这种现象，规模较大的社，可在管理委员会下建立定额管理委员会一类的组织，担负定额的制定、修正和检查总结的责任，以不断使计件制逐渐达到完善地步。（完）
