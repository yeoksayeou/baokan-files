(Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 14th) Trade talks between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Indonesia are proceeding smoothly in Jakarta. Indonesian figures unanimously hope that the results of the current talks will further strengthen trade relations between Indonesia and China.

The Chinese trade delegation has been warmly welcomed and received by the Indonesian government and people from all walks of life in Jakarta. Members of the delegation have had extensive contact with Indonesian government officials, members of parliament, and figures from the Indonesian banking and business communities.

The Indonesian delegation participating in the talks, as well as Abdurgani, Secretary-General of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry, and Sudiro, Mayor of Jakarta, hosted receptions for the Chinese trade delegation. On the 3rd, the Chinese trade delegation, at the invitation of the Indonesian Ministry of Economic Affairs, visited the Indonesian Rubber Research Institute and the famous Botanical Garden in Bogor, near Jakarta.

On the 12th, a senior Indonesian government official told a "Newspaper" reporter: Foreign trade delegations that have come to Indonesia in the past have never received such attention, warm welcome, and courteous reception from all levels of Indonesian society as this Chinese trade delegation.

The Chinese trade delegation also attended receptions hosted by the General Association of Chinese Associations in Jakarta and the heads of the Bank of China.

(Xinhua News Agency, 14th) According to TASS: According to reliable sources, the United States is stepping up pressure on Indonesia to prevent Indonesia from selling rubber to the People's Republic of China. The message said that the Americans threatened that if Indonesia sold rubber to China, the United States would stop its "aid" to Indonesia.

Indonesian business circles and the public have expressed indignation at the United States' interference in Indonesia's free trade with the People's Republic of China. In protest against American interference, "Indonesian News" wrote in an editorial on the 13th that the United States had begun to threaten Indonesia even before the Sino-Indonesian trade talks had reached a final agreement. The Americans believe that Indonesia has no right to handle their own rubber. The editorial wrote that we now have two paths before us: either sell rubber or succumb to the Americans. Our entire nation is willing to choose the first path, because if we do not sell rubber to China, we will push more than ten million people engaged in rubber production to the brink of disaster.

    我国和印尼的贸易商谈在雅加达顺利进行
    印尼商界和公众抗议美国干涉印尼和我国贸易
    【新华社雅加达十四日电】中华人民共和国和印度尼西亚共和国之间在雅加达举行的贸易商谈正在顺利进行。印尼方面人士一致希望目前商谈的结果能进一步加强印尼和中国之间的贸易关系。
    中国贸易代表团在雅加达受到印尼政府和各界人士的热烈欢迎和招待。代表团人员和印尼政府、国会负责人士以及印尼银行界和商业界的人士进行了广泛的接触。
    参加商谈的印尼代表团和印尼外交部秘书长阿卜杜加尼、雅加达市长苏迪罗先后举行招待会招待中国贸易代表团。三日，中国贸易代表团应印尼经济部的邀请访问了雅加达附近的茂物的印尼橡胶研究所和著名的植物园。
    一位印尼政府高级官员十二日对“新报”记者说：以前到印尼来的外国贸易代表团从来没有像这次中国贸易代表团受到印尼各阶层人士这样的重视、热烈欢迎和殷勤接待。
    中国贸易代表团还出席了在雅加达的中华侨团总会和中国银行负责人的招待会。
    【新华社十四日讯】据塔斯社讯：据可靠消息，美国正加紧向印尼施加压力，以阻止印尼把橡胶卖给中华人民共和国。消息说，美国人扬言，如果印尼把橡胶卖给中国，美国就要停止对印尼的
  “援助”。
    印尼商界和公众对美国干涉印尼和中华人民共和国进行自由贸易一事，表示愤慨。“印尼新闻”为抗议美国的干涉，在十三日的一篇社论中写道，在这次中印（尼）贸易商谈还没有最后达成协议时，美国便开始对印尼进行威胁了。美国人认为，印尼没有权利来处理他们自己的橡胶。社论写道，现在摆在我们面前的有两条道路：要么出售橡胶，要么屈服于美国人。我们全国人民是愿意选择第一条道路的，因为如果我们不把橡胶卖给中国，我们将会把一千多万从事橡胶生产的人推到灾难的边缘。
