    Cooperatives in Most Prefectures of Hebei Province
    Supply Tianjin with Non-Staple Foods and Local Products
    Cooperatives in most prefectures of Hebei Province have signed supply and marketing contracts with Tianjin Food Company to supply Tianjin with vegetables and fruits such as potatoes, scallions, cabbage, Ya pears, and persimmons. According to the needs of the Tianjin construction departments, cooperatives in eight prefectures of Hebei Province, including Tongxian, Dingxian, and Cangxian, have signed supply and marketing contracts with Tianjin Native Produce Company to supply 950,000 catties of rope ends, which will be processed into hemp knives by the Native Produce Company and then supplied to the construction departments. When Tianjin Native Produce Company signed a supply and marketing contract for straw braid with cooperatives in Tianjin and Cangxian prefectures, it also suggested that the cooperatives change the white grass to flowered grass when organizing farmers to weave straw braid. This would not only increase the production of straw braid and increase income for farmers, but also make the straw braid suitable for urban processing and manufacturing of straw hats. Tianjin Aquatic Products Company also signed a contract with cooperatives in Tianjin and Tangshan prefectures and the Food Company of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region to supply Tianjin with more than 12.6 million catties of freshwater fish and seafood.

    河北省大部分专区合作社
    供应天津市副食品和土产品
    河北省大部分专区的合作社与天津市食品公司签订了供应天津市土豆、大葱、白菜、鸭梨、柿子等蔬菜和水果的供销合同。河北省通县、定县、沧县等八个专区的合作社根据天津市建筑部门的需要，和天津市土产公司签订了供销合同，供给绳头九十五万斤，由土产公司加工制成麻刀后再供应给建筑部门。天津市土产公司和天津、沧县专区的合作社签订草帽辫供销合同时，还建议合作社在组织农民编织草帽辫时将白草变为花原草，这样不仅可以增加草帽辫的产量，为农民增加收入，同时也使草帽辫适合城市加工制造草帽。天津市水产公司还与天津、唐山两专区及内蒙古自治区食品公司签订了供应天津市一千二百六十万余斤淡水鱼、海产品的合同。
