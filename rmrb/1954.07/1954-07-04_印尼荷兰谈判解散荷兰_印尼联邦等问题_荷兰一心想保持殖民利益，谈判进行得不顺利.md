Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 2nd—The Indonesian-Dutch negotiations, held to dissolve the Netherlands-Indonesia Union which has restricted Indonesia's national sovereignty for four and a half years, began in The Hague, Netherlands, on June 29. Because the Netherlands is single-mindedly trying to maintain its colonial interests, the negotiations have not been going smoothly from the start.

At the first negotiation meeting, Sunarjo, head of the Republic of Indonesia delegation, proposed that the meeting should discuss the following three issues: (1) Dissolving the Netherlands-Indonesia Union; (2) Ending the Round Table Conference agreements that are detrimental to Indonesia and establishing normal international relations between the two countries; (3) Returning West Irian to Indonesia.

Sunarjo said that the Republic of Indonesia delegation hopes that at the beginning of the negotiations, an agreement should first be reached on the issue of dissolving the Netherlands-Indonesia Union, so that negotiations can be held as two sovereign states.

Sunarjo emphasized that without a resolution of the West Irian issue, peace in the Asia-Pacific region will remain threatened. In his speech, Sunarjo also specifically mentioned the need to abolish the Dutch-Indonesian Cultural Agreement and the Financial and Economic Agreement in the Round Table Conference agreements that are detrimental to Indonesia's national interests.

Rens, head of the Dutch delegation, responded to Sunarjo's speech at the second meeting held on July 1. According to Reuters, the Dutch view is that this negotiation has "nothing to do" with the West Irian issue, and the Netherlands is also unwilling to unconditionally dissolve the Netherlands-Indonesia Union.

The meeting announced a recess until the 6th to continue. Reuters said: This "proves that the opinions of the two sides are very different, and it will be difficult to reach an agreement."

Indonesian newspapers have expressed dissatisfaction with the Dutch attitude in the negotiations. The "Eastern Star" of June 30 believes that the Dutch attitude towards the negotiations, especially the West Irian issue, is "frivolous and arrogant." The newspaper said that the Netherlands has adopted this attitude because it has the support of the United States. Due to the war conspiracies of the United States, the United States is very afraid of losing West Irian. The newspaper said that if West Irian is in the hands of the Netherlands, the US military base will be guaranteed.

    印尼荷兰谈判解散荷兰—印尼联邦等问题
    荷兰一心想保持殖民利益，谈判进行得不顺利
    【新华社雅加达二日电】为了解散对印尼的国家主权束缚了四年半之久的荷兰—印尼联邦而举行的印（尼）荷谈判，已在六月二十九日在荷兰海牙开始。由于荷兰一心想保持殖民利益，所以谈判一开始就进行得不顺利。
    参加谈判的印尼共和国代表团团长苏纳约在第一次谈判会议上提出，会议应该讨论下列三个问题：（一）解散荷兰—印尼联邦；（二）结束不利于印尼的圆桌会议协定，建立两国间的正常国际关系；（三）把西伊里安交还给印尼。
    苏纳约说，印尼共和国代表团希望在谈判开始的时候，应该首先在解散荷兰—印尼联邦问题上达成协议，以便作为两个主权国家来举行谈判。
    苏纳约强调说，西伊里安问题不解决，亚洲、太平洋地区的和平就仍然受到威胁。苏纳约在发言中还特别提到要废除圆桌会议协定中有损于印尼民族利益的荷印（尼）文化协定和财政与经济协定。
    荷兰代表团团长伦斯在七月一日举行的第二次会议中答复了苏纳约的发言。据路透社透露，荷兰的观点是：这次谈判和西伊里安问题“没有关系”，荷兰也不愿意无条件解散荷兰—印尼联邦。
    会议宣布休会到六日再继续举行。路透社说：这“证明双方的意见相去很远，达成协议将很困难。”
    印尼报纸对荷兰在谈判中的态度表示不满。六月三十日的“东星报”认为荷兰对谈判、特别是对西伊里安问题的态度是“轻率的、傲慢的”。报纸说，荷兰采取这种态度，是因为它有美国的支持。由于美国的战争阴谋，美国很怕失掉西伊里安。报纸说，如果西伊里安是在荷兰的手中，美国的军事基地就有保障了。
