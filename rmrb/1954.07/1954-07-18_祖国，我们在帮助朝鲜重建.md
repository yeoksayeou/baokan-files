Motherland, We Are Helping North Korea Rebuild

Chen Yuanmou

Dear comrades and friends:

It's been almost a year since the Korean armistice. We know that in these days, you have been concerned about our work and our lives. Therefore, we always want to tell the people of the motherland many things. If we don't, we get anxious!

We are the railway corps of the Volunteer Army. After the armistice, we, like our brother units, have been carrying out the new task given to us by the motherland with full confidence: vigilantly guarding the position and helping the Korean people rebuild their homes. Moreover, with the support of the motherland, our work has changed greatly. As you all know, in that arduous war environment, we often used intense physical labor to support the war. Today, the people of the motherland have sent us a large number of machines, and we are driving them to work on the construction site. At one site, blowers are drilling holes in the mountains, making loud noises, bulldozers are transporting soil back and forth, mixers are gulping down stones, sand, water, and cement, mixing them into concrete, and dump trucks full of stones are speeding along light rails, and hundreds of railway soldiers are busy carrying soil, waving picks and shovels, working intensely. Every night, dozens of electric lights shine brightly, sparkling with dazzling brilliance. How happy the comrades are! When they see the light, they think of victory, they think of the motherland, this is the fruit earned with blood and sweat!

In the tense labor, the soldiers are always enthusiastic. They deeply understand: helping the Korean people build is the bounden duty of internationalist fighters. They said, "Our resistance against U.S. aggression and aid to Korea must be thorough! Although the war in Korea has stopped, the U.S. and the Syngman Rhee gangs are still clamoring to resume the war, and the war damage suffered by the Korean people has not yet been restored. How can we stand idly by and do nothing?" On a large filling site, the soldiers continued to work hard regardless of the height of the bridge, the steepness of the slope, the melting snow, slippery roads, or the raging wind and rain. They shouted, "The height of the bridge and the steepness of the slope are difficult, but they can't stop the heroic men of the railway corps!" "Rain can't penetrate our determination, wind can't blow away our enthusiasm!"

In the labor, the soldiers can not only endure hardship, but also are good at using their brains and actively studying technology. In a short period of time, many of them have mastered complex machine operation technology. Take Comrade Ran Xuwen as an example. This young soldier is only twenty-two years old this year. Before liberation, the whole family worked for the landlord, without food or clothing. After joining the revolution, he learned more than 1,800 characters. One day, when he heard that the superiors wanted him to learn how to operate a machine, he jumped up with joy. But he also thought, "Can I learn with this little education?" The company commander said to him: "Do you understand? To annihilate the enemy on the battlefield, you need sophisticated weapons and technology; to fight against nature, you also need advanced machines and technology! The sooner you master the machine and use it on the construction site, the sooner we will win!" Ran Xuwen understood, and went to learn how to operate the machine with the instructions of his superiors and the hopes of his comrades.

His determination was great, but the first lesson stumped him. How could a child from a poor family know those "engines" and "oil pumps"? He couldn't remember or write them down, and his head was ringing. But when he thought of the company commander and his comrades, courage came. He thought, "Are we always going to let the comrades stay in the caves and use their hands instead of machines? No, I must not fail the expectations of the Party, I must not fall behind!" He worked hard, listened carefully in class, wrote carefully, and asked the instructors and comrades when he didn't understand. He asked the comrades to help him organize and supplement the notes he missed, and marked the difficult and hard-to-remember parts, and studied them after class. Sometimes, in order to study a problem, he sacrificed his Sundays and lunch breaks. Studying day and night, two months passed, and he finally overcame the difficulties, became the master of the machine, and returned to the company with the machine.

Dear comrades and friends! I also want to tell you about Comrade Liu Jishan, a Communist Party member, who risked the rain to rescue more than a thousand kilograms of explosives in order to protect the property of the motherland.

The Second Company was about to finish drilling the blasting holes, and the superiors sent them more than a thousand kilograms of explosives, which they placed in a house not far from the construction site, close to a small river. One morning, it started to rain heavily, and the river water kept rising, gradually submerging the house. The squad leader guarding the explosives was anxious, and he rushed to the temporary rest area of the construction site to call his squad's soldiers.

Deputy squad leader Liu Jishan and his soldiers had been drilling blasting holes all night and were sleeping soundly. In a daze, he heard the squad leader shouting: "Get up, the flood is about to wash away our explosives!" He woke up in shock. Outside was a dark sky and pouring rain. But he ignored everything and rushed out without putting on his clothes, shouting as he ran: "Comrades! Let's rescue the property of the motherland!"

The rain was getting heavier and the river water continued to rise. The raging water hit the river bank, swallowing the soil on both sides. It was about to flood the house where the explosives were stored. Liu Jishan thought anxiously: "How much effort did the people of the motherland spend to transport these explosives to Korea! The blasting holes that the comrades worked so hard to drill are to be blasted with these explosives! If they are swallowed by the flood, how can we be worthy of the motherland? How can we complete the task?"

So he was the first to carry a box of more than sixty kilograms of explosives and ran out of the house in big strides. When he encountered a steep slope, he held the explosive box with one hand and pulled the branches with the other to move forward. He fell, got up, and walked again! Sweat and rain mixed on his body, his legs were injured, and blood flowed down, his body was covered with mud, but when he thought that he was a Communist Party member, that he was carrying the property of the motherland, and that he had a task, he forgot the pain and ran back and forth.

Liu Jishan's actions deeply moved the other soldiers. They said, "Don't worry, deputy squad leader, even if it's raining knives, we will rescue the explosives!"

Half an hour later, the flood submerged the houses by the river. However, all thirty-four boxes of explosives were rescued, so that the motherland's wealth of more than 80 million yuan was not lost at all.

Writing here, comrades, my heart is excited. The motherland is advancing, Korea is advancing, and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldiers far away in Korea are also advancing!

    祖国，我们在帮助朝鲜重建
    陈远谋亲爱的同志们，朋友们：
    朝鲜停战快一年了。我们知道，在这些日子里，你们关怀着我们的工作，关怀着我们的生活。因此，我们总想把很多事情告诉祖国人民。不说，心里就急得慌！
    我们是志愿军的铁道兵团。停战以后，我们和兄弟部队一样，信心百倍地执行着祖国给我们的新任务：警惕地守卫阵地，帮助朝鲜人民重建家园。而且，在祖国的支援下，我们的工作情况大大地变样了。你们都知道的，在那艰苦的战争环境里，我们常常用强度的体力劳动来支援战争，而今天，祖国人民给我们送来了大批的机器，我们开着它在工地上劳动了。在一个现场上，鼓风机在钻山开洞，发出轰轰隆隆的巨响，推土机来回地运送着土块，拌合机大口地吞食着石子、沙、水和水泥，把它们搅拌成混凝土，而装满石子的斗车，就飞奔在轻便的小铁轨上，成百的铁道兵战士们忙碌地担着土，挥舞着铁镐、铁锹，紧张地劳动着。每到夜晚，数十盏电灯齐放光明，闪烁着耀眼的光辉。同志们多么高兴！他们看到光明，就想到了胜利，就想到了祖国，这是用血汗换来的果实啊！
    在紧张的劳动里，战士们始终是热情的。他们深深地明白：帮助朝鲜人民建设，是国际主义战士应尽的责任。他们说：“咱们抗美援朝要彻底呀！朝鲜虽然停火了，但美李匪帮还在叫嚷着恢复战争，朝鲜人民受到的战争破坏还没有复原，我们怎能眼睁睁地看着不管呢？”在一个大填方上，战士们不管桥高坡陡，雪融路滑，也不顾狂风大雨，继续紧张地劳动着。他们高喊“桥高坡陡有困难，挡不住铁道战士英雄汉！”“雨，淋不透我们的决心，风，吹不走我们的热情！”
    战士们在劳动中，不仅能忍受艰苦，而且是善于用脑子，积极地钻研技术的。在短短的日子里，他们许多人都能掌握复杂的机器操作技术了。就拿冉绪文同志来说吧，这个年青的战士今年才二十二岁，解放前，全家大小都为地主劳动，没吃没穿的，在参加革命后，才学会了一千八百多字。一天，当他听到上级要他学开机器的时候，喜欢得蹦跳了起来。可是他又想：“咱这点文化能学会吗？”连长给他说了：“你明白吗？在战场上要歼灭敌人，需要精良的武器和技术；和自然作斗争，也同样需要先进的机器和技术呀！能早一天掌握机器，在工地上使用它，我们就能早一天胜利！”冉绪文明白了，带着上级的嘱咐和同志们的希望去学习开机器了。
    他的决心是大的，但第一堂课却把他难住了。一个穷人家出身的子弟，怎知道那些“引擎”、“油泵”呢？他记不上也写不了，只觉得脑袋一阵阵轰轰地发响。可是，一想起连长，想起同志们，勇气就来了。他想：“难道老是让同志们呆在洞里，用手来代替机器吗？不能，我绝不能辜负党的期望，绝不能掉队呀！”他奋发起来，上课时用心听，认真写，不懂的下来就问教员和同志，拉下的笔记就请同志们帮他整理和补充，难懂难记的就打上符号，下课后再钻研。有时他为了研究问题，连星期和午睡也牺牲了。日日夜夜地学习，两个月过去了，终于战胜了困难，成了机器的主人，带着机器回到了连队里。
    亲爱的同志们，朋友们！这儿还要告诉你们：共产党员刘继善同志为了爱护祖国的资财，冒雨抢救了一千多公斤炸药的事情。
    二连打炮眼快打好了，上级给他们发下了一千多公斤炸药，他们把它放在离工地不远的一座房子里。紧靠着一条小河。一天早晨下起了倾盆大雨，河水不断地上涨，渐渐地要淹没那所房子了。看守炸药的班长急了，他忙跑到工地临时休息处去叫他班的战士们。
    副班长刘继善和他的战士们，打了一夜炮眼，睡得正香，矇眬中听得班长的喊叫：“起来啊，洪水快要冲走我们的炸药了！”他惊醒起来。屋外是乌黑的天，瓢泼似的雨。但他不顾一切，没有穿好衣服就冲了出去，边跑边喊：“同志们！抢救祖国资财去！”
    雨下得更大，河水继续上涨，狂怒的水冲击着河岸，吞卷着两岸的泥土，眼看就要淹进放炸药的房子了。刘继善焦急地想：“祖国人民花了多少心血，才把这些炸药运到朝鲜来啊！同志们辛勤打的炮眼，就是要用这些炸药去爆破！要是叫洪水吞去，怎对得起祖国？怎完成任务？”
    于是他第一个扛起六十多斤的炸药箱大步地跑出房子，碰到陡坡，他就一手扶着药箱，一手拉着树枝爬着前进。跌倒了，爬起来，再走！汗和雨水在他身上交流，腿上挂伤了，鲜血也流了下来，泥糊了一身，可是他想到自己是共产党员，想到背着的是祖国的资财，想到任务，他忘了疼，来回地奔跑着。
    刘继善的行动，深深地感动了别的战士们，他们说：“副班长请放心，就是下刀子，我们也要把炸药抢运出来！”
    半点钟过后，洪水吞没了河边的房屋。可是，三十四箱炸药都被抢救了出来，使祖国八千余万元的财富没有受到丝毫损失。
    写到这里，同志们，我的心情是激动的。祖国在前进着，朝鲜在前进着，而远在朝鲜的中国人民志愿军战士们也同样地前进着！
