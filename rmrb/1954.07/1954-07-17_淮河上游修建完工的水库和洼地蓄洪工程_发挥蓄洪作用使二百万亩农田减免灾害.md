Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng, 15th: The completed Banqiao Reservoir, Shimantan Reservoir, Boshan Reservoir, and the Laowangpo, Jiaoting Lake, and Wu Song Lake polder storage projects in the Huai River upper reaches water control project played a role in flood interception and storage during the flood surge in early July, reducing flood disaster for two million mu of farmland.

From July 1st to 11th, heavy rainfall occurred in southern Henan Province, and the water levels of the Huai River mainstream and its tributaries, the Hong River and Ru River, rose sharply. Two peak floods occurred in eleven days, approaching or exceeding the 1931 flood level. When the flood peaks arrived, the completed Banqiao Reservoir, Shimantan Reservoir, Boshan Reservoir on the Hong River and Ru River, and the Laowangpo, Wu Song Lake, and Jiaoting Lake polder storage projects all opened their gates to intercept and store floodwater. Temporary flood detention projects in areas such as Suya Lake, Li Da Lake, Dongda Lake, and Nei River were also opened and used when the water situation became tense, greatly reducing the flood threat in the Hong River and Ru River basins. According to past hydrological data records, in the past, under similar flood conditions, the Hong River and Ru River basins would have been a vast expanse of water, and boats could freely travel in the fields from Runan to Xincai. This year, due to the control of floods by the Huai River water control project, the farmland in this area has greatly reduced the harm of floods. According to the Henan Provincial Flood Control Headquarters, at least two million mu of farmland in Xincai, Shangcai, Pingyu, Runan, and the areas between the Hong River and Ru River have been spared from disaster. On the 12th, the second flood peak has safely passed, and the water level is trending downward. The above-mentioned projects are releasing floodwater during the intervals between flood peaks, based on downstream water levels, to prepare for the arrival of the next flood.

    淮河上游修建完工的水库和洼地蓄洪工程
    发挥蓄洪作用使二百万亩农田减免灾害
    【新华社开封十五日电】淮河上游治淮工程中修建完工的板桥水库、石漫滩水库、薄山水库和老王坡、蛟停湖、吴宋湖等洼地蓄洪工程在七月上旬洪水上涨时发挥了拦洪蓄洪作用，使二百万亩农田减免了洪水灾害。
    七月一日到十一日，河南省南部普降大雨，淮河干流和支流洪河、汝河的水位急遽上涨。在十一天中就曾发生了两次最高洪水峰，并已接近或超过了一九三一年的洪水位。洪峰到达时，洪河、汝河上已完成的板桥水库、石漫滩水库、薄山水库和老王坡、吴宋湖、蛟停湖洼地蓄洪工程都开启闸门，拦洪蓄水。宿鸭湖、李大湖、东大湖、内水河等地的临时滞洪工程也在水情紧张时开放使用，使洪、汝河流域洪水威胁大大减少。根据过去水文资料纪录，过去在与此相当的洪水情况下，洪、汝河流域已是一片汪洋，自汝南到新蔡一段行船可以在田间自由来往。今年，由于洪水受到了治淮工程的控制，这一带的农田便大大减免了洪水的危害。据河南省防汛总指挥部估计：新蔡、上蔡、平舆、汝南和洪、汝河的夹河地带，至少有二百万亩农田减免了灾害。十二日，第二次洪水峰已经安全渡过，水位正趋下降。上述各工程正根据下游水位情况，利用洪峰间隙进行放洪，以为下次洪水的到来作好准备工作。
