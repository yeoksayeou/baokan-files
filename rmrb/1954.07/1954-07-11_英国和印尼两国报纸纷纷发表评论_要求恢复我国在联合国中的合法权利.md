Xinhua News Agency, London, July 9th: British newspapers are still paying close attention to the issue of restoring the People's Republic of China's rights in the United Nations, as Eisenhower and Dulles' recent statements indicated that the United States would use all its strength to oppose it. The reports and editorials in the newspapers regarding Dulles's statements all indicate that serious differences exist between Britain and the United States on this issue.

Many newspapers with large circulations sharply refuted Dulles's attacks on the People's Republic of China and demanded that the British government pursue an independent policy in its relations with the People's Republic of China.

The "Daily Mirror" editorial wrote, "Our goal should be to reach an agreement with the current Chinese regime," and pointed out that India and New Zealand advocate restoring the People's Republic of China's rights in the United Nations.

The "Daily Mail" criticized Eisenhower's statement in an editorial. The editorial emphasized that "Diplomacy should be based on the reality of things, not on empty imagination," and that "The United Nations is not an organization of countries with the same ideas, but an organization of all countries. If this is not the case, this organization is of no use. The approach taken by the United States cannot promote the rapprochement of the two worlds, making it less likely that the two worlds will gradually reconcile normally."

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, July 10th: "Indonesia Raya" published an editorial on the 9th saying that many countries hope to allow representatives of the People's Republic of China to enter the United Nations because they believe this is an issue closely related to their own interests.

The editorial said that this is especially true for Asian countries. The People's Republic of China becoming a member of the United Nations will be a major peaceful factor in the world's balance of power. The editorial said: "This will enable the economic and political ties between the People's Republic of China and Indonesia and other Asian countries to develop more smoothly, without obstacles such as the embargo policy currently formulated by the United States." The editorial then emphasized: "Only the United States and some of its servant countries are unwilling to see the People's Republic of China (representatives) enter the United Nations. However, no matter how stubbornly the United States opposes, it cannot stop the development of the world situation."

The "Bintang Timur" said in an editorial on the 9th that Indonesia believes that the People's Republic of China becoming a member of the United Nations will be beneficial to world peace. The editorial said that it is extremely unreasonable not to admit the People's Republic of China as a member of the United Nations, and no reason can be found on any page of the United Nations Charter to reject the People's Republic of China as a member of the United Nations. The United Nations has been weakened by not allowing representatives of the People's Republic of China to participate. "Bintang Timur" said that Indonesia supports the entry of representatives of the People's Republic of China into the United Nations to replace the Taiwan Kuomintang group supported by the United States in the Security Council.

### 英国和印尼两国报纸纷纷发表评论  要求恢复我国在联合国中的合法权利

    英国和印尼两国报纸纷纷发表评论
    要求恢复我国在联合国中的合法权利
    【新华社十日讯】塔斯社伦敦九日讯：英国报纸现在仍然极其注意关于恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的权利问题，因为艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯最近的发言都说到，美国将要用一切力量反对这样做。各报关于杜勒斯发言的报道和社评的实质都说明英美在这个问题上存在着严重的分歧。
    拥有大量发行额的许多报纸尖锐地反驳杜勒斯对中华人民共和国的攻击，并要求英国政府在和中华人民共和国的关系中执行独立的政策。
    “每日镜报”社论写道，“我们的目标应在于和现今的中国政权获致协议”，社论并指出，印度和新西兰主张恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的权利。
    “每日邮报”在社论中斥责艾森豪威尔的发言。社论着重指出“外交应以事物的现实情况为基础，而不是以凭空的想像为基础”，“联合国不是一个具有一样思想的国家的组织，而是所有国家的组织。如果不是这样的话，这个组织就没有一点用。美国所遵循的方针不能促进两个世界的接近，使两个世界很少可能正常地逐渐和好。”
    【新华社雅加达十日电】“印尼新闻”九日发表社论说，许多国家都希望让中华人民共和国的代表进入联合国，因为它们认为这是和它们自己的利益密切相关的问题。
    社论说，这对亚洲国家来说尤其是这样。中华人民共和国成为联合国的会员国这件事，将是在世界力量对比中的重大的和平因素。社论说：“这样就会使中华人民共和国和印尼以及其他亚洲国家之间的经济和政治联系得到更顺利的发展，而不会有像现在由美国所制订的禁运政策这样的障碍了。”社论接着强调指出：“只有美国和它的某些仆从国家才不愿意看到中华人民共和国（的代表）进入联合国。但是，不管美国如何顽固地反对都不能阻止世界局势向前发展。”
    “东星报”在九日的社论中说，印尼相信中华人民共和国成为联合国的会员国，将有益于世界和平。社论说，不接纳中华人民共和国作为联合国的会员国是极端不合理的，不管在联合国宪章的那一页上都找不到任何理由来拒绝中华人民共和国作为联合国的会员国。由于不让中华人民共和国的代表参加，联合国已经被削弱了。“东星报”说，印尼支持中华人民共和国的代表进入联合国，以代替被美国所撑持的台湾国民党集团在安全理事会中的位置。
