Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, 26th—Following the persecution of the East Pakistan organization of the Communist Party of Pakistan, the Pakistani government on the 24th declared the Communist Party of Pakistan "illegal" throughout West Pakistan. Prior to this, mass arrests were carried out in various places, and patriots such as Ferozuddin Mansoor, the acting General Secretary of the Communist Party of Pakistan, were illegally arrested. The democratic rights of the Pakistani people have been subjected to increasingly frantic attacks.

    In Lahore, while arresting Ferozuddin Mansoor, the police also searched and closed the national headquarters of the Communist Party of Pakistan. Also arrested were Mirza Muhammad Ibrahim, Chairman of the Pakistan Federation of Trade Unions, and Muhammad Afzal, General Secretary. In Peshawar, the Vice Chairman of the Northwest Frontier Province organization of the Pakistan People's Muslim League and others were arrested.

    Editors of some newspapers and periodicals, such as "Today's News," "Karachi Business Weekly," and the All-Pakistan Student Organization's publication "Student Vanguard," were also arrested in various places.

    According to Pakistani official announcements alone, 37 people have been arrested in various parts of West Pakistan this time. From June 1st to July 24th, 1,368 patriots (including communists) have been arrested in Pakistan.

    The Pakistani government's persecution of domestic patriotic and democratic forces has apparently become increasingly active with the intensified implementation of the US-Pakistan "Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement." The further oppression of the Communist Party of Pakistan and patriots that occurred immediately after the US Department of Defense announced on the 21st that a US military advisory group would soon go to Karachi is no coincidence.

### 巴基斯坦政府又宣布巴共在西巴为“非法”  并在各地进行大搜捕，疯狂迫害爱国民主力量

    巴基斯坦政府又宣布巴共在西巴为“非法”
    并在各地进行大搜捕，疯狂迫害爱国民主力量
    【新华社二十六日讯】喀喇蚩消息：继对巴基斯坦共产党东巴基斯坦组织的迫害之后，巴基斯坦政府又在二十四日宣布巴基斯坦共产党在整个西巴基斯坦为“非法”，并于事前就在各地进行大搜捕，非法逮捕了巴基斯坦共产党代理总书记斐罗苏丁·曼苏尔等爱国者。巴基斯坦人民的民主权利已经受到愈来愈疯狂的进攻。
    在拉合尔，警察在逮捕斐罗苏丁·曼苏尔的同时，还搜查并封闭了巴基斯坦共产党的全国总部。被逮捕的还有巴基斯坦总工会主席米尔扎·穆罕默德·易卜拉欣和总书记穆罕默德·阿弗萨尔。在白沙瓦，巴基斯坦人民回教联盟西北边省组织副主席等被逮捕。
    在各地被捕的还有“今天报”、“喀喇蚩商业周刊”和全巴基斯坦学生组织的刊物“学生先驱”等报刊的一些编辑人员。
    仅据巴基斯坦官方宣布，这次在西巴基斯坦各地逮捕的已有三十七人，从六月一日到七月二十四日，巴基斯坦被捕的爱国者（包括共产党员）已有一千三百六十八人。
    巴基斯坦政府对国内爱国民主力量的迫害显然是随着美巴“共同防御援助协定”的加紧执行而日益积极。在美国国防部二十一日公布美国军事顾问团即将前往喀喇蚩后，随即发生进一步压迫巴基斯坦共产党和爱国者的事件，并不是偶然的。
