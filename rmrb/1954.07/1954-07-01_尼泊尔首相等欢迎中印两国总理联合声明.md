Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 30th: Kathmandu dispatch: Nepalese Prime Minister Koirala and Foreign Minister Regmi welcomed the statement in the joint communique by the premiers of China and India in Delhi, which said that the principles contained in the agreement between China and India regarding trade and communications between China's Tibet region and India should apply to their relations with other Asian countries and the world.

Koirala said: The meeting of the premiers of two Asian countries to discuss peace and security in Asia is indeed noteworthy. Asian countries all love their freedom. It is truly inspiring to hear the premiers of China and India reiterate their willingness to safeguard this freedom. Since Nepal is a close neighbor of these two countries, it is quite natural that it is keenly concerned about this meeting.

Regmi also welcomed the joint statement issued by the Chinese and Indian premiers in Delhi. Regmi said that the agreement on trade and communications between China's Tibet region and India should become an example for other countries to follow.

    尼泊尔首相等欢迎中印两国总理联合声明
    【新华社新德里三十日电】加德满都消息：尼泊尔首相柯伊拉腊和外交大臣雷格米欢迎中印两国总理在德里发表的联合声明中所说，中印两国关于中国西藏地方和印度之间的通商和交通协定中所包括的原则应适用于他们与亚洲以及世界其他国家之间的关系。
    柯伊拉腊说：两个亚洲国家的总理会晤并商谈了和平与亚洲安全问题，这的确是值得注意的事。亚洲国家都热爱自己的自由。听到中印两国总理重申他们愿意维护这种自由的愿望，真是令人感奋。尼泊尔既然是这两个国家的近邻，它热切关心这次会谈是十分自然的。
    雷格米也表示欢迎中印两国总理在德里发表的联合声明。雷格米说，关于中国西藏地方和印度之间的通商和交通协定应该成为其他国家效法的范例。
