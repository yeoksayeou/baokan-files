    Xinhua News Agency, 16th: U.S. authorities are intensifying their efforts to direct the Syngman Rhee clique to conduct military preparations, in order to create tension in the Far East and threaten the stability of the Korean armistice.
    U.S. President Eisenhower recently instructed Syngman Rhee to go to Washington at the end of July for talks to discuss the so-called issue of the "unification" of Korea. According to Reuters, "authoritative diplomatic sources" in Seoul revealed that Syngman Rhee is prepared to "present his plan for unification by marching north" to Eisenhower during this meeting, and to request the accelerated expansion of the South Korean puppet army and the organization of a military aggression group in the Pacific region. According to UPI, South Korean Prime Minister Pyun Yung-tae also rabidly clamored in the National Assembly on the 14th that South Korea "refuses to conduct any further negotiations with the communists" and that "it is free to take any action regarding the armistice." Pyun Yung-tae also demanded that his American masters "provide active assistance and implement it immediately" in order to vigorously expand the South Korean puppet army.
    The Syngman Rhee clique is also busily conducting military deployments, preparing to spearhead new adventures for its American masters. South Korea's observer to the United Nations, Yim Pyong-chik, arrived in Seoul on the 12th on the orders of Syngman Rhee. According to "Western observers" in Seoul, Syngman Rhee will hold a series of meetings with Pyun Yung-tae and Yim Pyong-chik to formulate a "new plan" for the armed "unification" of Korea. At the same time, according to UPI, South Korean Army Chief of Staff Chung Il-kwon began on the 14th to establish the Second Field Army Headquarters and a comprehensive logistics command for the Rhee puppet army, so that the Rhee puppet army would be "completely capable of independent combat operations." According to UPI, this plan of the Syngman Rhee clique "was formulated with the complete approval of American military leaders." U.S. Eighth Army Commander Taylor, who is stationed in Korea, also recently told reporters that the task of U.S. military advisors stationed with the Rhee puppet army is now to "concentrate on establishing the foundation of South Korea's logistics and combat troops."

    美国继续制造远东紧张局势
    指使李承晚进行军事准备
    【新华社十六日讯】美国当局正在加紧指使李承晚集团进行军事准备，来制造远东紧张局势和威胁朝鲜停战稳定。
    美国总统艾森豪威尔已在最近要李承晚在七月底到华盛顿去举行会谈，讨论所谓“统一”朝鲜的问题。据路透社报道，汉城方面的“权威的外交人士”透露，李承晚准备在这次会谈中向艾森豪威尔“提出他的北进统一的计划”，并且要求加速扩充南朝鲜傀儡军队和组织太平洋地区的军事侵略集团。据合众社报道，南朝鲜国务总理卞荣泰也在十四日在国会内狂妄地叫嚣说，南朝鲜“拒绝再和共产党进行任何谈判”，“它自己有自由对停战采取任何行动”。卞荣泰还要求他的美国主子“进行积极援助并立即实施”，来大力扩充南朝鲜傀儡军队。
    李承晚集团并正在忙碌地进行军事部署，准备为它的美国主子进行新的冒险打头阵。南朝鲜驻联合国的观察员林炳稷已在十二日奉李承晚的命令赶到汉城。据汉城方面的“西方观察家”透露，李承晚将和卞荣泰、林炳稷举行一系列会议，拟订武力“统一”朝鲜的“新方案”。同时，据合众社报道，南朝鲜陆军参谋长丁一权已在十四日开始着手成立李伪军的第二个野战军司令部和一个全面的后勤司令部，以使李伪军“完全能独立地进行作战”。据合众社透露，李承晚集团的这个计划“是在美国军事领袖的完全赞同下拟订的”。侵朝美军第八军军长泰勒最近还对记者表示，美国驻李伪军的军事顾问现在的任务是“集中力量建立韩国的后勤部队、作战部队的基础”。
