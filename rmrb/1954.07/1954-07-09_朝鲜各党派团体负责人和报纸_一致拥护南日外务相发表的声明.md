Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 8th: Leaders of Korean democratic parties and social organizations have issued statements unanimously endorsing and supporting Foreign Minister Nam Il's statement summarizing the Geneva Conference's discussions on the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

Oh Jae-young, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the North Korean Democratic Party, stated: "The discussions on the Korean issue at the Geneva Conference proved that the position of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea delegation was entirely correct. The peaceful reunification of Korea can and must be resolved through consultation." He said: "The proposal put forward by our delegation at the Geneva Conference should, at all times, serve as the basis for resolving the Korean issue. This is the only way to resolve the Korean issue. The Korean people will continue to wage a resolute struggle for the peaceful reunification of the motherland based on this most just proposal that represents their own wishes."

Kim Dal-hyun, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Chondoist Chongu Party, said: Any attempts by the American imperialists to permanently divide the Korean people and impose the anti-popular puppet rule of South Korea on the northern half of the Republic cannot stop the Korean people from advancing towards peace, democracy, unification, and independence. The peaceful reunification of Korea must be realized by the Korean people themselves through consultation. Kim Dal-hyun said that the Korean Chondoist Chongu Party fully supports Foreign Minister Nam Il's statement.

Li Young-jae, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, published an article in "Democratic Korea" stating: Through the Geneva Conference, the entire Korean people have further strengthened their confidence that as long as the aggression of the American imperialists is eliminated, the Korean issue can be peacefully resolved by the Korean people themselves. He said: Korea must transition from a state of armistice to a consolidated peace and achieve peaceful reunification on a democratic basis. This is the unanimous demand of the Korean people and the hope of peace-loving people.

Seo Hui, Vice Chairman of the General Federation of Korean Trade Unions, stated: We workers, technicians, and staff fully support Foreign Minister Nam Il's statement, which correctly reflects the will of the Korean people. As pointed out in Foreign Minister Nam Il's statement, we believe that, with the support of the people of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the various people's democratic countries, and the peace-loving people of the world, we will surely sweep away the barriers between North and South Korea, draw closer to each other, and find a way to unify the motherland through mutual consultation. However, only through our further and stronger struggles in the future can we turn this possibility into reality.
    All the workers, technicians, and staff of our Republic must further strive to strengthen the democratic base, create a material foundation for the peaceful reunification of the motherland, and promote the realization of the peaceful reunification of the motherland.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 8th: Korean newspapers published editorials on the 7th, unanimously endorsing Foreign Minister Nam Il's "Statement Summarizing the Geneva Conference's Discussions on the Peaceful Resolution of the Korean Issue."

"Democratic Korea" published an editorial entitled "The Unyielding Will of the Korean People to Achieve the Peaceful Reunification of the Motherland." The editorial stated that Foreign Minister Nam Il's statement summarized the entire process of the Geneva Conference regarding the discussion of the Korean issue. At the same time, it once again clarified the consistent efforts of the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to peacefully resolve the Korean issue, and the unyielding will of the Korean people to strive for the peaceful reunification of the motherland.

The editorial stated that the entire process of the Geneva Conference's discussion of the Korean issue once again proved to the people of the world the peace-loving policies of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Soviet Union, and the People's Republic of China. The Geneva Conference also reaffirmed that the American imperialists, who are unwilling to peacefully resolve the Korean issue and attempt to maintain and deepen international tensions, are the most ferocious enemies of the Korean people and all peace-loving people in the world.

"Nodong Sinmun" published an editorial entitled "The Peaceful Reunification of the Motherland Will Surely Be Realized," stating that although the Geneva Conference did not reach any agreement on the Korean issue due to the despicable sabotage of the United States and the Lee Seung-man gang, it did achieve certain results.

The editorial pointed out that the participation of the People's Republic of China, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the Soviet Union in international conferences together has great significance for the development of future international relations. The conference showed that the spirit of consultation has gained more supporters, and the United States' "policy of strength" is being rejected by the people of all countries.

The editorial pointed out that the peaceful life of the Korean people must be guaranteed. Since the peace forces of the world were able to achieve the Korean armistice, they can consolidate this armistice and guarantee the peaceful life of the Korean people. The Korean people are convinced that by using all possibilities, eliminating the temporary barriers between North and South Korea to bring them closer together, it is certainly possible to find a way to achieve the peaceful reunification of Korea through mutual consultation.

The editorial concluded by saying that our motherland will surely be peacefully reunited. All the Korean people, united as one, will clear away all obstacles and move more powerfully towards the road of peaceful reunification of the motherland!

    朝鲜各党派团体负责人和报纸
    一致拥护南日外务相发表的声明
    【新华社平壤八日电】朝鲜各民主党派、各社会团体负责人发表谈话，一致拥护和支持南日外务相就总结日内瓦会议关于和平解决朝鲜问题的讨论发表的声明。
    北朝鲜民主党中央委员会副委员长吴济永发表谈话说：“日内瓦会议关于朝鲜问题的讨论证明，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表团的立场是完全正当的。朝鲜的和平统一，是可以而且必须以协商的方法解决的。”他说：“在日内瓦会议上，我们代表团提出的方案，在任何时候，都应该作为解决朝鲜问题的基础。这是解决朝鲜问题的唯一道路。朝鲜人民将根据这个最正当的代表自己愿望的方案，为实现祖国的和平统一而继续进行坚决斗争。”
    朝鲜天道教青友党中央委员会委员长金达铉说：美帝国主义者的任何企图使朝鲜人民永久分裂，把南朝鲜的反人民的傀儡统治强加于共和国北半部的阴谋活动，都阻挡不了朝鲜人民为和平、民主、统一、独立而前进的道路。朝鲜的和平统一必须由朝鲜人民自己以协商的方法来实现。金达铉说：朝鲜天道教青友党完全支持南日外务相的声明。
    朝鲜勤劳人民党中央委员会委员长李英在“民主朝鲜报”上发表文章说：通过日内瓦会议，全朝鲜人民进一步加强了信心：只要消除美帝国主义的侵略，朝鲜问题是可以由朝鲜人民自己来和平解决的。他说：朝鲜必须由停战状态转变为巩固的和平，在民主的基础上，实现和平统一。这是朝鲜人民的一致要求，是爱好和平人们的希望。
    朝鲜职业总同盟副委员长徐辉发表谈话说：我们工人、技术者、职员完全支持南日外务相正确地反映了朝鲜人民意志的声明。和南日外务相的声明中所指出的一样，我们相信：我们必将在苏联、中华人民共和国和各人民民主国家人民和全世界爱好和平人民的支持下，扫除南北朝鲜之间的障壁，互相接近，以互相协商的方法，找出统一祖国的可能。但是，只有我们今后进一步坚强的斗争，才能把这个可能变成现实。
    我们共和国全体工人、技术者和职员要进一步为加强民主基地而斗争，创造和平统一祖国的物质基础，促进祖国和平统一的实现。
    【新华社平壤八日电】七日的朝鲜各报发表社论，一致拥护南日外务相发表的“总结日内瓦会议关于和平解决朝鲜问题的讨论的声明”。
      “民主朝鲜报”以“朝鲜人民争取祖国和平统一的不屈意志”为题发表社论。社论说，南日外务相的声明，总结了日内瓦会议关于讨论朝鲜问题的全部过程。同时再一次阐明了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府为和平解决朝鲜问题的一贯的努力，和朝鲜人民争取祖国和平统一的不屈意志。
    社论说，日内瓦会议讨论朝鲜问题的全部过程，再一次向全世界人民证明了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、苏联和中华人民共和国的爱好和平的政策。日内瓦会议也再一次证实了，不愿和平解决朝鲜问题并力图维持和加深国际紧张局势的美帝国主义者，是朝鲜人民和全世界爱好和平人民的最凶恶的敌人。
      “劳动新闻”发表题为“祖国的和平统一必将实现”的社论说：日内瓦会议虽然由于美国和李承晚匪帮的卑劣的破坏，关于朝鲜问题没有达成任何协议，但是获得了一定的成果。
    社论指出，中华人民共和国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和苏联一起参加国际会议，对于今后的国际关系的发展有着重大的意义。会议表明：协商精神获得了更多的支持者，美国的“实力政策”受到一切国家人民的排斥。
    社论指出，朝鲜人民的和平生活必须得到保证。全世界的和平力量既然能够使朝鲜停战实现，就能够巩固这个停战，就能够保证朝鲜人民的和平生活。朝鲜人民确信，利用一切可能性，消除南北朝鲜之间的暂时的障壁使之相互接近，以相互协商的方法，一定可以找到实现和平统一朝鲜的可能性。
    社论最后说，我们祖国必将和平统一。全朝鲜人民像一个人一样团结起来，清除一切障碍，更有力地向着祖国的和平统一道路前进！
