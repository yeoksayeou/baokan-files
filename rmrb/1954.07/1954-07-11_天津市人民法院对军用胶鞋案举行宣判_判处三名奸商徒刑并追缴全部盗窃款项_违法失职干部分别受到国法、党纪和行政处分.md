[Report from this newspaper] The Tianjin military rubber shoe deterioration incident, after thorough investigation by the North China Administrative Committee People's Supervisory Committee and the Supreme People's Procuratorate of the Central People's Government and other authorities, has been handed over to the relevant Tianjin authorities for handling, according to the instructions of the State Council of the Central People's Government. The Tianjin People's Court, based on the prosecution of the Tianjin People's Procuratorate, held a public sentencing rally on the afternoon of July 9, and made a judgment on the illegal case of some private rubber manufacturers in Tianjin who cut corners in the processing and manufacturing of military rubber shoes for the Volunteers. Three unscrupulous merchants involved in serious circumstances were given criminal penalties.

    Kong Baoxiang, the former director of Yu Fu Rubber Factory, altered the formula, stole and replaced raw materials, reduced working hours, and even created false accounts, stealing more than 61 million yuan of state property in the processing of this batch of military rubber shoes. Of the 22,100 pairs of rubber shoes processed by the factory, more than 65 percent of the finished products deteriorated, causing a loss of more than 176 million yuan to state property and affecting the military supply for the front lines of the war to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. In the process of investigating this case by the relevant units, Kong Baoxiang not only did not honestly confess his crimes, but also obstructed others from confessing their problems. Later, due to the presence of witnesses and material evidence, he had no choice but to confess his guilt, and the circumstances of the crime were serious and heinous. The Tianjin People's Court decided to severely sentence Kong Baoxiang to three years of imprisonment, recover all stolen funds, and impose a fine of twice the amount of the stolen funds. Wei Changbin, the manager of Feilong Rubber Factory, falsely reported processing fees and working hours, increased costs, altered the formula, stole and replaced raw materials, altered specifications, concealed surplus materials, and stole more than 210 million yuan of state property in the processing of military rubber shoes. Of the 61,000 pairs of rubber shoes processed by the factory, more than 61 percent of the rubber shoes deteriorated, causing a loss of more than 539 million yuan to state property and affecting the military supply for the front lines of the war to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, and the circumstances of the crime were serious. However, Wei Changbin performed better in the investigation of this case by the relevant units and was willing to confess his guilt. The Tianjin People's Court decided to leniently sentence Wei Changbin to two years of imprisonment with a two-year reprieve, recover all stolen funds, and impose a fine of three times the amount of the stolen funds. Li Chunchao, the manager of Synthetic Rubber Factory, was the leader of the technical cost group for the processing of military rubber shoes for eighteen private rubber factories. He not only failed to set an example and abide by the various provisions of the processing agreement, but instead altered the formula, stole and replaced raw materials, falsely reported costs, and stole more than 494 million yuan of state property. Of the 92,000 pairs of rubber shoes processed by the factory, more than 43 percent of the rubber shoes deteriorated, causing a loss of more than 450 million yuan to state property and affecting the military supply for the front lines of the war to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, and the circumstances of the crime were serious. However, Li Chunchao honestly confessed afterwards, had a good attitude, and had sincere remorse, so he was leniently sentenced to two years of imprisonment with a two-year reprieve, all stolen funds were recovered, and a fine of one time the amount of the stolen funds was imposed. The other fifteen private rubber manufacturers in this case have been ordered by the relevant departments in Tianjin to recover the stolen funds or impose fines according to the different circumstances.

    State employees who violated the law and neglected their duties in the processing of this batch of military rubber shoes, in addition to Zhang Zhichen, the director of the Military Supplies Production Department of the Logistics Department of the North China Military Region, have been given punishments by the military, and other personnel have been given punishments by the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Tianjin Municipal People's Government, and the Tianjin Municipal People's Court respectively.

    Shi Siliang (Communist Party member), the former director of Tianjin Local State-Owned Rubber General Factory and the current deputy director of the Tianjin Municipal People's Government Local State-Owned Industrial Bureau and director of the Light Industry Management Office, has serious capitalist management ideas. In the case of Tianjin's public-private rubber factories defrauding the military in 1951 by processing military raincoats, Shi Siliang was also largely responsible. Although he made a review at the time, he did not learn a lesson from it. In this task of Tianjin Rubber Factory processing more than 310,000 pairs of military rubber shoes for the Volunteers, he was seriously irresponsible, failed to make proper arrangements in advance, failed to supervise and inspect afterwards, and approved the factory's branch factory to steal and replace military raw materials, producing a large number of bad shoes, destroying the state's policies and laws, delaying the front-line supply, and causing a loss of more than 1.89 billion yuan to state property. Due to Shi Siliang's violation of the law and dereliction of duty in his work, he committed a serious political error. The Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China decided to give him a punishment of probation within the Party for two years; the Tianjin Municipal People's Government decided to give him a dismissal; and the Tianjin Municipal People's Court sentenced Shi Siliang to two years of imprisonment with a two-year reprieve according to law.

    Chen Guojun (Communist Party member), the deputy director and technician of Tianjin Local State-Owned Rubber Factory No. 1 (formerly Branch Factory No. 1), was responsible for leading the factory's technical operations. After accepting the task of processing military rubber shoes, he believed that "making money is less and there are more troubles." He neither made good production preparations before starting work, nor did he earnestly and responsibly carry out his work after starting work, so that problems continued to occur in technical operations and labor discipline. Chen Guojun also arbitrarily changed the formula and illegally stole and replaced military raw materials, resulting in serious deterioration of the rubber shoes, affecting military supplies, and causing significant losses to state property. The Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China decided to give Chen Guojun a punishment of probation within the Party for one year; the Tianjin Municipal People's Government decided to give him a dismissal; and the Tianjin Municipal People's Court sentenced Chen Guojun to one year of imprisonment with a one-year reprieve according to law.

    Liu Tong (Communist Party member), the director of Tianjin Local State-Owned Rubber Factory No. 1 (formerly Branch Factory No. 1), was seriously irresponsible in the task of processing military shoes, took a tolerant attitude towards illegal theft of military rubber, and suppressed workers' criticism. The Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China decided to give him a disciplinary action of removing him from his post within the Party; the Tianjin Municipal People's Government decided to give him a dismissal. Sun Yunsheng, the former deputy director of Tianjin Local State-Owned Rubber Branch Factory No. 1 and the current head of the Production Planning Section of Tianjin Local State-Owned Rubber Factory No. 3, has serious capitalist management ideas and was seriously irresponsible in the task of processing military rubber shoes, and received an administrative punishment of dismissal. The punishments for Shi Siliang and others have been announced by the relevant Party organizations and administrative organs respectively. The Tianjin People's Court held a public sentencing rally on the morning of the 9th and made a judgment on Shi Siliang, Chen Guojun's crimes of violating the law and neglecting their duties.

    判处三名奸商徒刑并追缴全部盗窃款项
    违法失职干部分别受到国法、党纪和行政处分
    【本报讯】天津市军用胶鞋变质事件，经华北行政委员会人民监察委员会和中央人民政府最高人民检察署等机关先后彻查后，已根据中央人民政府政务院的批示，将这一事件交由天津市有关机关处理。天津市人民法院根据天津市人民检察署的起诉，已在七月九日下午举行公开宣判大会，对于天津市部分私营橡胶厂商在为志愿军加工制造军用胶鞋中偷工减料的违法案件作了判决，其中情节严重的三名奸商分别受到刑事处分。
    前裕蚨橡胶厂厂长孔宝祥在加工这一批军用胶鞋中，偷改配方，盗换原料，偷减工时，甚至制造假账，盗窃国家资财六千一百多万元。该厂加工的两万二千一百双胶鞋中，有百分之六十五以上的成品变质，使国家财产损失达一亿七千六百多万元，并影响了抗美援朝前线的军需供应。在有关单位检查这一案件的过程中，孔犯宝祥对自己的犯罪行为不但不老实交代，并阻碍他人交代问题，后因人证物证俱在，无可抵赖，始低头认罪，罪情严重恶劣。天津市人民法院决定从严判处孔犯宝祥徒刑三年，追缴全部盗窃款项，并科处盗窃款项二倍的罚金。飞龙橡胶厂经理魏昶斌在加工军用胶鞋中，虚报加工费用和工时，加大成本，偷改配方，盗换原料，偷改规格，隐匿剩余材料，盗窃国家资财两亿零一百多万元。该厂加工的六万一千双胶鞋中，变质的胶鞋占百分之六十一以上，使国家财产损失达五亿三千九百余万元，并影响了抗美援朝前线的军需供应，罪情严重。但魏昶斌在有关单位检查这一案件中，表现较好，尚肯认罪。天津市人民法院决定从轻判处魏昶斌徒刑二年缓刑二年，追缴全部盗窃款项，并科处盗窃款项三倍的罚金。合成橡胶厂经理李春潮在加工军用胶鞋中，为十八家私营橡胶厂加工军用胶鞋的技术成本组组长，不但不以身作则，遵守加工协议书的各项规定，反而偷改配方，盗换原料，虚报成本，盗窃国家资财四亿九千四百多万元。该厂加工的九万二千双胶鞋中，变质的胶鞋占百分之四十三以上，使国家财产损失达四亿五千多万元，并影响了抗美援朝前线的军需供应，罪情严重。但李春潮事后老实交代，态度较好，有悔罪诚意，故从轻判处徒刑二年缓刑二年，追缴全部盗窃款项，并科处盗窃款项一倍的罚金。对这一案件中的其他十五家私营橡胶厂商已由天津市主管部门根据不同情节，分别追缴盗窃款项或处以罚金。
    在这批军用胶鞋加工中违法失职的国家工作人员，除华北军区后勤军需生产部处长张植臣等，已由军方分别给以处分外，其他人员，已由中共天津市委会、天津市人民政府、天津市人民法院分别作出处分决定。
    前天津地方国营橡胶总厂厂长、现任天津市人民政府地方国营工业局副局长兼轻工业管理处处长史思良（共产党员），有严重的资本主义经营思想。在一九五一年天津市公私营橡胶厂加工军用雨衣、对军方实行诈骗的案件中，史思良也负有很大责任，当时他虽作了检讨，但未引为教训。在这次天津橡胶厂为志愿军加工军用胶鞋三十一万多双的任务中，又严重不负责任，事先未作妥善布置，事后也未督促检查，并批准该厂所属一分厂盗换军方原料，制出大量坏鞋，破坏了国家政策法令，贻误了前方供应，使国家资财遭受了十八亿九千多万元的损失。由于史思良在工作中违法失职，犯了严重的政治错误，中共天津市委会决定给以留党察看二年的处分；天津市人民政府决定给予撤职处分；天津市人民法院依法判处史思良徒刑二年缓刑二年。
    天津地方国营橡胶一厂（原一分厂）副厂长兼技师陈国钧（共产党员），负责领导全厂技术操作，在接受军用胶鞋加工任务后，认为“赚钱少，麻烦多”，开工前既未作好生产准备，开工后也未认真负责地进行工作，以致在操作技术上、劳动纪律上不断发生问题。陈国钧并擅自更改配方，非法盗换军方原料，以致造成胶鞋严重变质，影响军需供应，使国家资财受到重大损失。中共天津市委会决定给陈国钧以留党察看一年的处分；天津市人民政府决定给予撤职处分；天津市人民法院依法判处陈国钧徒刑一年缓刑一年。
    天津地方国营橡胶一厂（原一分厂）厂长刘桐（共产党员），在军鞋加工任务中严重地不负责任，对违法偷盗军方橡胶采取纵容态度，并曾压制工人批评。中共天津市委会决定给以党内撤销工作处分；天津市人民政府决定给以撤职处分。前天津地方国营橡胶一分厂副厂长，现任天津地方国营橡胶三厂生产计划课课长孙允生，有严重的资本主义经营思想，在军用胶鞋加工任务中严重不负责任，受到行政上撤职处分。对史思良等的处分，已分别由有关的党组织和行政机关宣布。天津市人民法院在九日上午举行公开宣判大会，对史思良、陈国钧的违法失职罪行作了判决。
