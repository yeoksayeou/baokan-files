The expansion of the state-owned Liling Pharmaceutical Factory (manufacturing traditional Chinese medicine) in Hunan Province was completed in early June and will soon be officially put into production. The factory was expanded from the Chinese medicine extraction department of the former Liling County Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine. Before the expansion, it was merely a handicraft workshop, with production tools such as ancient and clumsy chaff cutters, stone mortars and iron mortars, and cooking stoves. After the expansion, the crushing workshop will use electric crimping machines, medicine cutting machines, and universal grinders to replace chaff cutters and stone mortars. Steam devices have been added to the cooking pots and concentration pots. The traditional Chinese medicine produced by the factory will be sufficient to supply the entire needs of ten county-level joint clinics of traditional Chinese medicine.

    醴陵制药厂扩建完工
    湖南省地方国营醴陵制药厂（制造国药）已于六月初扩建竣工，即将正式投入生产。该厂是由前醴陵县立中医院中药提炼部扩建而成的，扩建前只是一个手工业作坊，生产工具是古老的、笨拙的铡刀、石研与铁研、锅灶等。扩建后，粉碎车间将以电动的压筋机、切药机、万能磨粉机来代替铡刀和石研。蒸煮锅、浓缩锅都增加了蒸汽装置。该厂所产的国药，足够供应十个县中医联合诊所的全部需要。
