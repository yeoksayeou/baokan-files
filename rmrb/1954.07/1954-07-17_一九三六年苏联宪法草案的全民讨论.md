The Nationwide Discussion of the Draft Constitution of the Soviet Union in 1936
By Luoning, Soviet Master of Laws

The 1936 Constitution of the Soviet Union, through legislative procedure, consolidated the world-historical victory of socialism and the elimination of the exploiting classes and the system of human exploitation in the Soviet Union. It is a great summary of the heroic creative labor of the various nationalities of the Soviet state. The Constitution affirmed the social and political systems that favored the working masses.

The starting point of the Soviet Constitution is: the working class holds the state power of the Soviets; the working class realizes the state leadership (dictatorship) of society; the worker-peasant alliance—a strong social force, the cornerstone of the consolidation and strength of the Soviet socialist state—is the highest principle of the dictatorship of the proletariat.

The Soviet Constitution has a true internationalist character, and its starting point is the recognition of the complete equality of all races and nationalities in the Soviet Union.

The material and legal guarantees for the great democratic rights and freedoms enjoyed by Soviet citizens in social, economic, and political aspects are confirmed in the Soviet Constitution. Unlike bourgeois constitutions, which consider social injustice and the system of a few exploiters enslaving the people as sacred and inviolable, the Soviet Constitution provides the world with a model of a truly people's constitution—the fundamental law of the most democratic socialist country in the world.

The provisions of the Soviet Constitution profoundly and comprehensively reflect the thorough and extremely extended socialist democracy of the Soviet system.

One of the most obvious manifestations of socialist democracy is the nationwide discussion of the draft of the Soviet Constitution, which took place between June and November 1936.

The new draft Constitution of the Soviet Union was drafted according to the proposals of the advanced and leading forces of the Soviet people—the Communist Party—for the benefit of the Soviet people, to directly conform to the highest will of the people, and to meet the people's desire to fix the historical achievements of socialist victory in the fundamental law of the Soviet state.

The drafting of the draft Constitution was carried out according to the decision of the highest state power organ of a special type in the Soviet Union—the Seventh All-Union Congress of Soviets. This meeting, representing the will of all the people of the Soviet Union, passed a historically significant resolution on February 6, 1935: the Soviet Constitution must fully conform to the fundamental changes that have taken place in all aspects of social, economic, and political life in our country due to the victory of socialism.

In order to comprehensively take into account the interests of all nationalities in the Soviet Union in the work of drafting the Constitution, the leaders of the Communist Party and the Soviet government, headed by Comrade Stalin, plenipotentiary representatives of the union republics, outstanding innovators and advanced workers in industry and agriculture, as well as workers in science and culture, were selected to form the Constitutional Committee.

In the entire process of drafting the draft Constitution, the committee extensively relied on the active assistance of the highest and local state power organs of the Soviets, as well as party, trade union, and social organizations, and scientific research organs, when selecting and sorting out a large amount of materials related to the practical activities of the Soviet state organs and Soviet legislation.

It can be seen from this that the broad masses of working people actively participated in the process of drafting the draft Constitution through their state organs and mass organizations.

In mid-May 1936, the Constitutional Committee finally passed the draft Constitution. This draft, after being approved by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Presidium of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union, was published in the Soviet press on June 12, 1936, for nationwide discussion.

The nationwide discussion of the draft Constitution formed a mass movement, which, in terms of its true democracy and breadth, was an unprecedented social phenomenon in all of human history. It can be said without exaggeration that all the people of the Soviet Union very actively participated in the discussion of the new draft Constitution of the Soviet Union. In the vast land of the great country where socialism has won victory, from the Arctic region to the Black Sea coast, from Vladivostok to Minsk, millions of Soviet people greeted the provisions of this draft, which stipulates and consolidates the great achievements of the Soviet working masses in the cause of building a socialist society, with unparalleled creative enthusiasm. The draft was discussed at millions of meetings held in factories, institutions, collective farms, universities, at mass meetings of citizens, and at plenary sessions and congresses of local Soviets. Discussions on the draft were also carried out in local and central publications. In order to deeply study the content of the draft Constitution, special groups, training courses, and political schools were established in many places at the initiative of the workers. In order to help study the Constitution, tens of thousands of seminars, lectures, and reports were held.

The draft Constitution was unanimously supported by the people everywhere. But the Soviet people did not limit themselves to supporting the draft. Every provision of the draft aroused the great creative enthusiasm of the Soviet people, and they put forward countless suggestions, supplements, and textual amendments, etc. The editorial committee of the Constitutional Committee, headed by Comrade Stalin, was able to draw from the great source of nationwide discussion, and did draw many supplements of great value to the draft, which were included in the final draft Constitution passed by the Extraordinary Eighth All-Union Congress of Soviets.

The following materials are sufficient to prove the scale of the nationwide discussion. From August 15 to October 19, 1936, the draft Constitution was discussed in detail at 410,000 mass meetings of workers, 48,189 plenary sessions of the Soviets, and 79,294 meetings of Soviet groups and representative groups. The number of people participating in these meetings reached more than 51 million, accounting for 55 percent of the country's adult population. In many areas of the Soviet Union, almost all adults participated in the discussion. Residents everywhere participated very actively in the discussion.

During the period of discussing the draft Constitution, the workers listened to the summary reports of the local Soviets on their work, and criticized the shortcomings in the work of state organs with the attitude of masters. In many areas, voters widely exercised their right to remove incompetent representatives in the process of the Soviet summary movement.

The workers elected outstanding advanced workers, innovators in industry and agriculture, and Soviet cultural workers, and elected their new representatives to replace those who had been removed. It can be seen from this that the nationwide discussion, in essence, promoted all the work of state organs and improved the connection between the Soviets and the working masses.

In the process of the nationwide discussion of the draft Constitution, the workers put forward more than 1.5 million various amendments, supplements, and suggestions.

The process of this greatest political movement of the nationwide discussion was unfolded in a very organized way under the leadership of the party and Soviet organs. All the suggestions and supplements put forward by citizens and labor organizations in various places were collected, studied, and sorted out by the executive committees of the district Soviets, the executive committees of the state Soviets, and the organs of the central executive committees of the autonomous republics and union republics, and then sent to the organizational department of the Presidium of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union, where the materials from various places were then compiled and submitted to the Constitutional Committee.

The most important amendments and supplements to the draft proposed by Soviet citizens were formally reflected in the resolutions of the congresses of Soviets at all levels in the districts, cities, states, and republics convened in October-November 1936. At these congresses, the draft was discussed and unanimously expressed support, and representatives to the Extraordinary Eighth Soviet Congress of the USSR were elected.

The work carried out by the Extraordinary Eighth All-Union Congress of Soviets (November 25-December 5, 1936) was the final stage of the nationwide discussion.

The Soviet Congress, in the name of millions of Soviet people, unanimously supported the draft of the Soviet Constitution, and entrusted the editing committee elected by the congress, chaired by Stalin, to make the necessary supplements and revisions to the draft based on the most valuable proposals and amendments put forward in the process of the nationwide discussion, and to determine it.

Based on these suggestions, the final draft Constitution, which was approved by the Soviet Congress on December 5, 1936, included forty-three amendments and supplements, many of which involved major issues of principle.

The editing committee of the Extraordinary Eighth All-Union Congress of Soviets, based on the materials of the nationwide discussion, added many important and valuable supplements to the provisions of the first chapter of the draft Constitution.

For example, in the second paragraph of Article 7, a supplement of extremely important substance was added: the main income of each collective farm household (excluding the income obtained from the small plot of land for personal use as stipulated in the agricultural labor combination regulations) is the income received from the public collective farm. This supplement excellently emphasized the coordination and consistency of the public interests and personal interests of citizens under the socialist system, on the basis of the socialist economic system and the socialist ownership of the means of production and production tools. The amendment to Article 8 of the Constitution is of great significance. This amendment specifically emphasized that the land used by collective farms is not only used by the farms indefinitely, but also free of charge. Article 10 also made important supplements to the issue of the protection of Soviet law, which, in addition to protecting the ownership of personal property, also protects the right of citizens to inherit personal property.

The supplement to Article 12 proposed by the editing committee of the Soviet Congress based on many suggestions made during the nationwide discussion is also worthy of attention. This supplement pointed out that labor in the Soviet Union is not only an obligation, but also an honorable cause, a glorious cause.

The amendments and supplements made by the editing committee to Chapter 3 of the draft are of great significance both theoretically and practically.

The suggestions belonging to this type of amendment include the suggestion on the equal number of representatives in the two houses of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, the adoption of the same system for elections in the two houses, the increase of the number of vice-chairmen of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union to eleven (which corresponds to the number of union republics that were then incorporated into the Soviet Union), and the suggestion that the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union publish laws in the languages of the union republics.

According to the suggestions of the whole people, a substantial supplement was made to Article 49, paragraph 13 of the Constitution, which pointed out that the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union has full power to declare a state of war not only when the Soviet Union is subjected to armed aggression, but also "...when it is necessary to fulfill the obligations of international mutual defense against aggression treaties." The extremely great international significance of this supplement is inestimable, because it emphasizes to the world in an extraordinarily convincing and clear way the truly progressive nature of the Soviet Union's foreign policy, which is in complete conformity with the interests of all peace-loving people. The Soviet Union's foreign policy aims to maintain peace, defend the collective security of all nations, and effectively defend against imperialist aggression.

In addition to these major principled amendments, the editing committee of the Soviet Congress also made many textual amendments and supplements to many other provisions of the Constitution based on the materials of the nationwide discussion.

Because the Soviet people very actively participated in the discussion of the draft Constitution, the entire content of the Constitution was involved in the process of perfecting the draft Constitution. The Soviet people, under the leadership of their beloved Communist Party, solemnly and carefully treated the formulation of the new fundamental law of the socialist country with the attitude of masters, because their vital interests and their highest power and sovereignty are most completely and comprehensively expressed and consolidated in this law.

As Comrade Stalin pointed out in his report on behalf of the editing committee at the Extraordinary Eighth All-Union Congress of Soviets, the nationwide discussion was of great benefit to the formulation of the Soviet Constitution and the final modification of this Constitution. The nationwide discussion embodied the profound unity of the Communist Party, the Soviet government, and the Soviet people, and embodied the strength and role of the moral and political unity of Soviet society formed on the basis of the victory of socialism.

The experience of the nationwide discussion of the 1936 Constitution of the Soviet Union is of great international significance. The people's democratic countries in Europe and Asia, who are firmly embarking on the road of building their new, happy, and free life under the banner of peace, democracy, and socialism, are today creatively applying this experience.

Nationwide discussion is a feature of the process of formulating new truly democratic constitutions in Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Albania. This is a clear manifestation of the very active participation of the people of these countries in consolidating the new progressive constitutional norms that are conducive to the social and political system of the working people.

There is no doubt that the great movement of the nationwide discussion of the first draft democratic constitution currently unfolding in the vast land of the People's Republic of China will be of great benefit to the thoroughness of the formulation and the perfection of the content of this constitution, this legal document of the supreme sovereign will of the great Chinese people.

    一九三六年苏联宪法草案的全民讨论
    苏联法学硕士  罗宁
    一九三六年的苏联宪法，以立法手续巩固了社会主义在苏联所获得的世界历史性胜利和剥削阶级与人剥削人制度的被消灭，它是苏维埃国家各族人民英勇的创造性劳动的伟大总结。宪法确认了有利于劳动群众的社会制度与政治制度。
    苏联宪法所持的出发点是：劳动者阶级执掌苏维埃的国家权力；工人阶级实现对社会的国家领导（专政）；工农联盟——强大社会力量，苏维埃社会主义国家巩固和强大的基石——是无产阶级专政的最高原则。
    苏联宪法具有真正的国际主义性质，它所持的出发点是，承认苏联的一切种族和民族完全平等。
    对苏联公民在社会、经济和政治各方面所享有的伟大民主权利和自由的物质上和法权上的保障，在苏联宪法中得到了确认。和认为社会不公平、少数剥削者奴役人民的制度是神圣不可侵犯的资产阶级宪法不同，苏联宪法向全世界提供了真正人民的宪法——世界上最民主的社会主义国家的根本法——的典范。
    苏联宪法的条款，深刻而全面地反映了苏维埃制度的彻底的、极其扩展的社会主义民主制。
    社会主义民主制最明显的表现之一就是，一九三六年六月至十一月间展开的对苏联宪法草案的全民讨论。
    苏联的新宪法草案，是根据苏联人民群众的先进力量与领导力量——共产党的提议，为了苏维埃人民的利益，为了直接符合于人民的最高意愿，符合于人民渴望把社会主义胜利的历史性成果固定到苏维埃国家根本法中的要求而拟定的。
    宪法草案的拟定，是根据苏联特种类型的最高国家权力机关——第七次全苏苏维埃代表大会的决定而进行的。这次会议表现着苏联全体人民的意志，于一九三五年二月六日通过了一项具有历史意义的决议：必须使苏维埃宪法完全符合于我国因社会主义的胜利而在社会、经济和政治生活各方面发生的根本变化。
    为了在拟定宪法工作中，全面照顾到苏联各族人民的利益、以斯大林同志为首的共产党和苏维埃政府的领导者、加盟共和国的全权代表、工业和农业的杰出的革新者和先进工作者以及科学和文化工作者，被选出组成了宪法委员会。
    委员会在拟定宪法草案的全部工作中，在选择和整理有关苏维埃国家机关的实际活动和苏维埃立法的大量材料时，曾广泛地依靠了苏维埃最高的和地方的国家权力机关以及党、工会和社会组织、科学研究机关等的积极帮助。
    由此可见，广大的劳动群众通过自己的国家机关和群众组织积极地参加了拟定宪法草案的过程。
    一九三六年五月中旬，宪法委员会最后通过了宪法草案。这个草案在得到了苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联中央执行委员会主席团同意之后，于一九三六年六月十二日在苏联报刊上公布，供全民讨论。
    宪法草案的全民讨论，形成了群众性的运动，这个运动就其真正民主性和范围之广来看，乃是人类过去全部历史中空前未有的社会现象。可以毫不夸大地说，全体苏联人民都非常积极地参加了苏联新宪法草案的讨论。在社会主义获得了胜利的伟大国家的广阔土地上，从北极区到黑海边，从海参崴到明斯克，千百万苏联人民怀着无比的创造性热情迎接了这个规定着并巩固着苏联劳动群众在建设社会主义社会事业中所获得的伟大成果的草案的条款。在工厂、机关、集体农庄、高等学校举行的千万次集会上，在公民群众大会上，在地方苏维埃全体会议和代表大会上，都曾讨论了草案。在地方和中央的刊物上，也展开了对草案的讨论。为了深入地研究宪法草案的内容，根据劳动者的倡议在许多地方建立了专门的小组、训练班和政治学校。为了帮助研究宪法，举办了数万次座谈、讲演和报告。
    宪法草案到处得到了人民的一致拥护。但是苏联人民并没有只限于拥护草案。草案的每一条款都引起了苏维埃人民巨大的创造积极性，他们提出了无数建议、补充和文字方面的修改意见等等。以斯大林同志为首的宪法委员会中的编辑委员会，能够从全民讨论的伟大泉源之中吸取、而且吸取了许多对草案有重大价值的补充，非常第八次全苏苏维埃代表大会所通过的最后的宪法草案中便包括了这些补充意见。
    下面的材料便足以证明全民讨论的规模。一九三六年八月十五到十月十九日在四十一万次劳动者群众大会上，四万八千一百八十九次苏维埃全体会议上，七万九千二百九十四次苏维埃小组和代表小组会议上详细地讨论了宪法草案。参加这些会议的人数，达五千一百万人以上，占全国成年人口的百分之五十五。在苏联许多地区，几乎所有成年人都参加了讨论。到处居民都非常积极地参加了讨论。
    在讨论宪法草案的时期，劳动者听取了地方苏维埃关于工作的总结报告，并以主人翁态度批评了国家机关工作中的缺点。许多地区，选民在苏维埃总结运动的进程中，广泛运用了撤换不称职的代表的权利。
    劳动者选出了工业、农业的优秀先进工作者，革新者，苏维埃文化工作者，选出了自己的新代表来代替那些被撤换了的代表。由此可见，全民的讨论，在实质上促进了国家机关的全部工作，改善了苏维埃同劳动群众之间的联系。
    在全民讨论宪法草案的进程中，劳动者提出了一百五十万项以上各种修正、补充和建议。
    全民讨论这一最伟大的政治运动的进程，是在党和苏维埃机关领导下，极有组织地展开的。各地公民和劳动者组织所提出的一切建议和补充，都由区苏维埃执行委员会、州苏维埃执行委员会、自治共和国和加盟共和国苏维埃中央执行委员会的机关来收集、研究和整理，然后送交苏联中央执行委员会主席团组织部，由这里将各地材料再汇交宪法委员会。
    苏维埃公民所提出的对草案意义最重大的修正和补充，俟后在一九三六年十月—十一月区、市、州和共和国各级所召开的苏维埃代表大会的决议中得到了正式的反映，在这些代表大会上，讨论了并一致表示拥护草案，同时还选出了出席非常第八次苏联苏维埃代表大会的代表。
    非常第八次全苏苏维埃代表大会所进行的工作
  （一九三六年十一月二十五日—十二月五日）是全民讨论的最后阶段。
    苏维埃代表大会，以千百万苏联人民的名义一致拥护苏联宪法草案，并委托由大会选出的以斯大林任主席的审编委员会根据在全民讨论进程中所提出的最有价值的提议和修正，对草案作必要的补充并加以确定。
    根据这些建议，审编委员会在一九三六年十二月五日苏维埃代表大会上所批准的最后宪法草案之中，加入了四十三项修正和补充，其中许多是涉及原则性的重大问题。
    非常第八次全苏苏维埃代表大会审编委员会，根据全民讨论的材料，在宪法草案第一章的条款中，加入了许多重要的有价值的补充。
    例如在第七条第二段里便加入了在实质上极重要的补充：集体农庄每一农户的主要收入（依农业劳动组合章程规定为个人使用的小块园地所得到的收入除外）为从公共集体农庄领得的收入。这项补充卓越地强调了在社会主义制度下，在社会主义经济体系及对生产资料和生产工具社会主义所有制统治的基础上，公民的公共利益与个人利益的协调一致。对宪法第八条的修正有着重大的意义。这条修正特别着重指出了，集体农庄所使用的土地，不但归农庄无限期使用，而且无代价使用。第十条对苏维埃法律的保护问题也做了重大的补充，法律除保护个人财产所有权之外，还保护公民个人财产之继承权。
    苏维埃代表大会审编委员会根据全民讨论过程中所提出的许多建议而提出的对第十二条的补充，也是值得注意的。这项补充指出，劳动在苏联不仅是义务，而且是荣誉的事业，光荣的事业。
    审编委员会对草案第三章所做的修正和补充，无论在理论上和实践上都具有重大的意义。
    属于这种修正的有，关于苏联最高苏维埃两院代表名额相等的建议，关于两院选举采取同一制度，关于将苏联最高苏维埃主席团副主席增至十一人
  （这符合于当时加入到苏联的加盟共和国的数目），以及关于苏联最高苏维埃用各加盟共和国文字公布法律的建议。
    根据全民的建议，对宪法第四十九条十三款作了有关实质性的补充，这项补充指出，苏联最高苏维埃主席团不仅在苏联遭受武装侵犯时，而且“……遇必须履行国际互防侵略条约义务时”有全权宣布战争状态。这项补充的极重大的国际意义是难以估计的，因为它异常令人信服地和明确地向全世界强调指出了苏联对外政策的这种完全符合于一切爱好和平人民利益的真正进步性质。苏联的对外政策，旨在维护和平，保卫各族人民的集体安全，旨在有效地防御帝国主义的侵略。
    除上述这些原则性的重大修正之外，苏维埃代表大会审编委员会，根据全民讨论的材料，对宪法的其它许多条款，也做了许多文字上的修正和补充。
    由于苏联人民群众非常积极地参加了宪法草案的讨论，所以在宪法草案趋于完善的过程中，涉及到了宪法的全部内容。在自己亲爱的共产党领导下的苏联人民，庄严而又慎重地，以主人翁的态度来对待社会主义国家新的根本法的制定，因为在这个法律上最完整、最全面地表现出并巩固着他们的切身利益和他们的最高的权力与主权。
    如斯大林同志在其以审编委员会名义在非常第八次全苏苏维埃代表大会上所做报告中指出的，全民的讨论对制定苏联宪法和最后修饰这个宪法都有着很大的好处。全民讨论体现出了共产党、苏维埃政府和苏维埃人民的深刻的团结一致，体现出了在社会主义胜利基础上所形成的苏维埃社会的道义上和政治上的团结一致的力量与作用。
    一九三六年苏联宪法全民讨论的经验，是有着极大的国际意义的。在和平、民主与社会主义旗帜下，坚定不移地踏上建设自己新的、幸福和自由生活之途的欧亚两洲的人民民主国家，今天正在创造性地运用着这个经验。
    全民讨论是罗马尼亚、匈牙利、保加利亚、捷克斯洛伐克、波兰和阿尔巴尼亚在制定新的真正民主的宪法过程时的特点。这是这些国家人民群众非常积极地参加巩固有利于劳动者的社会、政治制度的新的进步的宪法规范的明显表现。
    毫无疑问，目前在中华人民共和国广阔土地上展开的对第一个民主宪法草案的全民讨论的伟大运动，对这个宪法，这个伟大中国人民最高主权意志的法律文件，在制定上的周密和内容完善方面，是有着巨大的益处的。（本报特约稿）
