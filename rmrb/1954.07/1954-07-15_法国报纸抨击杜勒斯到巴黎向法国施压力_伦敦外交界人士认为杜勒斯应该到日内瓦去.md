Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, July 13th: French newspapers revealed on July 13th that Dulles convened a meeting of the British and French Foreign Ministers in Paris to obstruct the Geneva Conference from reaching an agreement on restoring peace in Indochina.

　　"Le Monde" said that Dulles's purpose in coming to Paris was: "to warn the allies that if the armistice does not meet American standards, the United States will disassociate itself from the armistice and refuse to participate in the international guarantee agreement." The newspaper also said that Dulles also attempted to force the French government to explain: "How France is prepared to strengthen its army if the Geneva Conference fails."

　　"Libération" asked: "Isn't this Dulles trying to make a final effort to obstruct the signing of a ceasefire agreement by the French government?" The newspaper said: "In any case, Mr. Dulles's place should be in Geneva, where peace talks are being held, not in Paris."

　　"L'Humanité" said that the French people "refuse to recognize Dulles's right to decide what France should or should not do. They reject the latest blackmail that the US Secretary of State is preparing to play."
Xinhua News Agency, July 14th: TASS, Paris, July 13th: US Secretary of State Dulles arrived in Paris on July 13th, preparing to hold talks with French Prime Minister Mendès France and British Foreign Secretary Eden.

　　The French bourgeois newspaper "Le Figaro" believes that Eden and Mendès France "are trying to persuade the person they are talking to to believe that the active participation of the United States in the Geneva Conference is absolutely necessary."

　　"Combat" wrote: Dulles will certainly show the concerns of the American government in Paris today, because Washington is afraid of peace in Indochina.

　　"Combat" continued to write: "It is noteworthy that the American leaders ignore France's right to pursue its own policies. Because if Mendès France can conclude a glorious armistice agreement as we hope, it will be tantamount to indicating that blindly submitting to Washington's instructions is not necessarily consistent with France's national interests."

　　"L'Humanité" emphasized that the US Secretary of State's trip to Paris proves that "the US government, uneasy about the progress made on the Indochina issue and uneasy about its policy that has led it into isolation, does not hesitate to exert rude pressure on the French government."

　　"Le Monde", when talking about Dulles's visit to Paris for talks, believes that the US government is attempting to deprive Mendès France of the freedom to conduct armistice negotiations in Indochina.

　　"Le Monde", when talking about the methods of the United States, said: "From now on, no one can ignore the universal desire of France to stop the war in Indochina, the yearning of the Vietnamese for independence, the extensive struggle of the Viet Minh for independence, and the universal desire of the people of all countries, especially the people of the United Kingdom, to avoid the expansion of the conflict. At the same time, no one can ignore the difficult situation of the French Expeditionary Force."
Xinhua News Agency, July 14th: TASS, London, July 13th: Dulles will hold separate talks with the British and French Foreign Ministers in Paris on July 13th.

　　Reuters reported on the reaction of London diplomatic circles to Dulles's trip to Paris. The report said: "Here (London) believes that it is absolutely necessary for a senior official of the American government to hold talks with Mendès France at a time when crucial talks in Geneva are about to begin.

　　At the same time, London still holds the opinion that it is necessary for Dulles to go to Geneva in person."

    法国报纸抨击杜勒斯到巴黎向法国施压力
    伦敦外交界人士认为杜勒斯应该到日内瓦去
    【新华社日内瓦十三日电】法国报纸十三日揭露，杜勒斯到巴黎召集英法两国外长会谈，是为了阻挠日内瓦会议在恢复印度支那和平方面达成协议。
    “世界报”说，杜勒斯到巴黎来的目的是：“警告盟国，如果停战不合乎美国的标准，美国就要和这个停战脱离关系，并且拒绝参加国际保证协定。”这家报纸又说，杜勒斯还企图迫使法国政府说明：
  “如果日内瓦会议失败了，法国准备如何加强其军队。”
      “解放报”问道：“这难道不是杜勒斯试图对法国政府进行最后的努力，来阻挠签订停火协定吗？”这家报纸说：“无论如何，杜勒斯先生的位置应该是在正举行和平谈判的日内瓦，而不是在巴黎。”
    “人道报”说，法国人民“拒绝承认杜勒斯有权决定法国应该作什么，或者不应该作什么。他们拒绝美国国务卿正准备玩弄的最新的敲诈。”
    【新华社十四日讯】据塔斯社巴黎十三日讯：美国国务卿杜勒斯十三日到达巴黎，准备同法国总理孟戴斯—弗朗斯和英国外交大臣艾登举行会谈。
    法国资产阶级报纸“费加罗报”认为，艾登和孟戴斯—弗朗斯“正在设法说服同他们会谈的人，要他相信美国积极参加日内瓦会议是绝对必要的”。
      “战斗报”写道：杜勒斯今天在巴黎一定会表现出美国政府的忧虑，因为华盛顿害怕印度支那的和平。
      “战斗报”接着写道：“令人注意的是：美国的领导者无视法国奉行自己的政策的权利。因为如果孟戴斯—弗朗斯能像我们所希望那样缔结了光荣的停战协定，那就无异表明，盲目屈从于华盛顿的指令，是并不一定和法国的民族利益一致的。”
      “人道报”着重指出，美国国务卿巴黎之行证明：“美国政府由于对在印度支那问题上所获得的进展感到不安，对自己的政策使自己陷于孤立感到不安，便不惜对法国政府横施粗暴的压力。”
      “世界报”在谈到杜勒斯到巴黎来会谈时认为，美国政府企图剥夺孟戴斯—弗朗斯进行印度支那停战谈判的自由。
      “世界报”在谈到美国的手段时说：“从今以后，谁也不能忽视法国要求停止印度支那战争的普遍愿望，忽视越南人要求独立的热望，忽视越盟为争取独立而进行的广泛斗争，忽视各国人民、特别是联合王国人民要求避免冲突扩大的普遍愿望。同时谁也不能忽视法国远征军的艰难处境。”
    【新华社十四日讯】塔斯社伦敦十三日讯：杜勒斯十三日将在巴黎和英法两国外长举行单独会谈。
    路透社报道了伦敦外交界人士对杜勒斯巴黎之行的反应。这个报道说：“这里（伦敦）认为在日内瓦的紧要会谈即将开始的时候，一个美国政府的高级官员和孟戴斯—弗朗斯举行会谈是绝对必要的。
    同时，伦敦方面仍然有这样的意见：杜勒斯亲自到日内瓦去是必要的”。
