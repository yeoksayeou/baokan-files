Guangxi Province Coastal Areas Strengthen Dike Repairs to Safely Weather June High Tide

    More than 100,000 people in the coastal areas of Hepu, Qin County, and Fangcheng counties in the Qinzhou Special District of Guangxi Province, after more than a month of emergency repairs to the embankments and strengthened dike maintenance, safely weathered the June high tide. The two tides in early and mid-June this year were much larger than in previous years, but thanks to the active leadership of the Party committees at all levels and the farmers' advance preparation for inspection and repair of the embankments, farmland was not invaded by the tides. Before the arrival of the high tide, Qin County repaired the wave breaks, leaks, and sluice gates that needed repair; the Sixth District repaired 13,713 meters of dangerous dikes and 92 sluice gates, and universally inspected and repaired all projects one to three times, ensuring the solidity of the quality. At the same time, various tide prevention organizations were improved and the maintenance of the embankments was strengthened. The ten coastal districts of Hepu County established 58 tide prevention and dike protection committees, divided into 451 groups (teams), and selected more than 2,800 young and middle-aged militia cadres to take charge of guarding. At 6:00 PM on June 17th, the tide surged, suddenly breaking the wall panel of the Gaodetian sluice gate in Yanlou Township, Dangjiang District of the county. The entire township's tide prevention team immediately issued an alert, led by more than ten cadres, and mobilized a total of 105 people for rescue, completely plugging the sluice gate in just over an hour, saving more than 1,000 mu of early rice from loss. Due to the active repair and maintenance of the embankments, not only the safety of the lives and property of the coastal people has been guaranteed, but also the hope of a bumper harvest has been brought to more than 500,000 mu of early rice in the coastal areas. According to reports from various places, this year's production is generally expected to increase by 10 to 20 percent. Currently, in the fields along the coast, the rice seedlings are generally pregnant and earing.

    广西省沿海加强修围护堤安度六月大潮
    广西省钦州专区合浦、钦县、防城三县沿海的十多万人民，经过一个多月的抢修基围，加强管护堤防，安然地度过了六月大潮。今年六月上旬、中旬的两次潮水都比往年大得多，但由于各级党委积极领导农民，预先做好基围的检查和修补工作，因而农田没有受到潮水的侵袭。钦县在大潮到来前，将该修补的浪口、漏洞、水门都修补好了；六区共修险堤一万三千七百一十三公尺，补修水门九十二个，并将全部工程普遍检查修补了一次至三次，保证了质量的牢固。同时各地还健全了各种防潮组织，加强基围的管护。合浦县十个沿海区共建立防潮护堤委员会五十八个，分成四百五十一个小组（队），选出青壮年民兵干部等二千八百多人，分工负责看守。六月十七日下午六时，潮水汹涌，突然把该县党江区烟楼乡高德田?的水门的墙板冲破了，于是全乡的防潮队马上发出警报，由十多个干部领导，共出动一百零五人进行抢救，一个多钟头便把水门全部塞好，使一千多亩早稻免受损失。由于积极修补和管护基围，不仅保证了沿海人民生命财产的安全，而且给沿海区五十多万亩早稻带来丰收的希望，目前在沿着海岸的田野里，禾苗已普遍含胎抽穗。据各地反映，今年一般都能增产一、二成。
