The Geneva Conference, which the whole world is concerned about, has now come to a successful conclusion. Agreements on the restoration of peace in Indochina have finally been reached. This not only marks the end of the long-term bloody war in Indochina, but also plays an extremely important role in promoting collective security in Asia and further easing tensions in Asia and the world. It once again shows the world that it is entirely possible and necessary to resolve international disputes through peaceful consultations, and that the "policy of strength" of resolving international disputes by force is doomed to failure.

Since the Korean armistice, the proponents of the American "policy of strength" have been doing everything possible to cobble together a Southeast Asian aggressive bloc in order to prevent further easing of international tensions, and conspiring to interfere in and expand the Indochina war through "joint action." Before and during the Geneva Conference, the proponents of the American "policy of strength" on the one hand spread "pessimistic" air, clamoring that the conference negotiations were useless, and on the other hand created various obstacles during the conference in an attempt to hinder and disrupt the progress of the conference. The US delegation not only failed to put forward any constructive proposals during the seventy-plus days of the conference, but also unreasonably opposed all reasonable proposals from the Soviet, Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese delegations. This fully exposed the true intentions of the US delegation in participating in the conference. On the other hand, after the US representative Dulles left Geneva in embarrassment because he was unable to manipulate the conference, he personally ran to Paris a few days before the end of the conference to put pressure on Britain and France, attempting to replace the Indochina armistice agreement with a Southeast Asian aggressive bloc. However, the proponents of the American "policy of strength" miscalculated from beginning to end. The direction of historical development is not determined by the conspiracies and ambitions of a few people, but by the common aspirations of hundreds of millions of people. Hundreds of millions of people demand peace, and peace becomes an irresistible force. The successful conclusion of the Geneva Conference eloquently proves this point. In fact, it was not the Geneva Conference that was destroyed by the proponents of the American "policy of strength," but their conspiracy was once again exposed in front of the people of the world, and it was the further isolation and unpopularity of the US war-mongering ruling clique, and the shameful collapse of the French Laniel government that followed the American "policy of strength."

Reaching an agreement on the Indochina issue is a major achievement of the Geneva Conference. Although no agreement was reached on the Korean issue, it has not been removed from the agenda. The discussion on the Korean issue is still of great significance for the future peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

The Geneva Conference made peace triumph over war once again. This is the result of the great efforts of the Soviet, Chinese, and Vietnamese delegations and the full support of all peace-loving people in the world. The delegation of the People's Republic of China, in line with our country's consistent peaceful diplomatic policy, fully reflected the strong will of the Chinese people who have stood up to strive for peace. In negotiating major international issues with major powers in the capacity of one of the world's major powers, it made due contributions and greatly improved our country's international prestige and status. We are proud of their achievements and express our warm gratitude and respect to them!

We fully agree with and fully support all the agreements reached at the Geneva Conference on the Indochina issue. The victory of the Geneva Conference encourages us to be more confident and work with all peace-loving people in the world to strive for the complete implementation of these agreements. At the same time, we remain highly vigilant. The US war-mongering ruling clique will not give up. They are stepping up their collusion with the Chiang Kai-shek remnant bandits and using Taiwan, which has been our country's territory since ancient times, as an invasion base to be enemies with our people. We must never tolerate this. We must liberate Taiwan and will never stop until we achieve our goal! All members of our China Association for Promoting Democracy must unite more closely under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, study hard, do our work well, and contribute all our strength to overcome all the conspiracies and sabotage of enemies at home and abroad, to complete the great cause of socialist construction and socialist transformation in our country, and to defend peace in Asia and the world!

    中国民主促进会主席马叙伦的谈话
    全世界关心的日内瓦会议现在圆满结束了，关于恢复印度支那和平问题终于达成了协议，这不仅使印度支那的长期的流血战争宣告结束，而且对于促进亚洲的集体安全和进一步缓和亚洲与世界紧张局势发生着极为重大的作用。它再一次地向全世界表明：用和平协商方式解决国际争端是完全可能而且必要的，用武力解决国际争端的“实力政策”是注定要失败的。
    自从朝鲜停战以后，美国“实力政策”的推行者为阻止国际紧张局势进一步缓和，千方百计地在拼凑东南亚侵略集团，阴谋以“联合行动”干涉和扩大印度支那战争。日内瓦会议召开前后，美国“实力政策”的推行者一方面散布“悲观”空气，叫嚣着会议谈判无用，并在会议进行中制造各种障碍，企图阻碍和破坏会议的进行。美国代表团不但在七十多天的会议中始终没有提出任何一个建设性的建议，而且毫无道理地对苏联、中国、朝鲜和越南代表团的合理建议一概加以反对，这就充分暴露了美国代表团参加会议的真正意图；另一方面美国代表杜勒斯由于无法操纵会议而狼狈离开日内瓦以后，一直到会议临近结束的前几天还亲自跑到巴黎去，向英法施加压力，企图以东南亚侵略集团代替印度支那停战协定。但是，美国“实力政策”的推行者从头到尾失算了，历史发展的方向，不是决定于少数人的阴谋和野心，而是决定于亿万人民群众的共同愿望，亿万人民群众要求和平，和平就成为不可抗拒的力量。日内瓦会议圆满结束这一事实，就雄辩地证明了这一点。事实上，不是日内瓦会议被美国“实力政策”的推行者所破坏，而是再一次在全世界人民面前揭穿了他们的阴谋，而是美国好战的统治集团的更加孤立，更加不得人心，而是追随美国“实力政策”的法国拉尼埃政府可耻的垮台。
    印度支那问题达成协议，是日内瓦会议的重大收获。朝鲜问题虽然没有达成任何协议，但并没有从议程上去掉，关于朝鲜问题的讨论，对于今后和平解决朝鲜问题仍具有重大的意义。
    日内瓦会议使和平又一次战胜战争。这是苏联、中国、越南代表团的重大努力和全世界一切爱好和平人民全力支援的结果。中华人民共和国代表团本着我国一贯的和平外交政策，充分反映了站起来了的中国人民争取和平的坚强意志，在以世界大国之一的身份与各大国一起协商重大国际问题中，作出了应有的贡献，大大地提高了我国的国际威望和地位，我们以他们获得的成就为光荣，并向他们致热烈的感谢和敬意！
    我们完全同意和全力支持日内瓦会议关于印度支那问题所达成的各项协议。日内瓦会议的胜利，鼓舞着我们更加信心百倍地和全世界爱好和平人民一起争取这些协议的彻底实现。同时，我们保持高度警惕，美国好战的统治集团不会就此罢休，它们正在加紧勾结蒋介石残余匪帮，并把自古以来就是我国领土的台湾作为侵略基地，以与我国人民为敌，我们对此决不能容忍，我们一定要解放台湾，不达目的，决不休止！我们中国民主促进会全体成员一定更加紧密地团结在中国共产党的领导下，努力学习，做好工作，为战胜国内外的一切敌人的阴谋破坏，为完成我国社会主义建设和社会主义改造的伟大事业，为保卫亚洲与世界和平贡献一切力量！
