    In the high and cold mountain areas of Guizhou Province, there are many outstanding Communist Party members who are leading the farmers of various ethnic groups in the mountains to gradually organize themselves and carry out the production transformation work in the mountains, so that the face of the barren mountains is gradually changing. Zhang Mingliang, a Miao Communist Party member from the Miao Autonomous Region of Lushan County, is one of them.

    Zhang Mingliang is forty-six years old this year. In the old society, he lived a miserable life for forty-one years under the whip of the landlord. It was not until the winter of 1949 that this hired peasant, who had suffered all kinds of oppression, finally turned over under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party.

    In August 1951, land reform was completed in the villages near Zhang Mingliang's hometown. The ethnic minority farmers in the mountainous areas, who had just been allocated land, had many difficulties in production. At this time, Zhang Mingliang participated in the peasant representative meeting in the province and learned something about the Party's policy of mutual aid and cooperation. Under the education and encouragement of the Party, after returning to the village, he mobilized seven Miao farmers who had mutual aid habits to organize a mutual aid group to help each other in labor, which enabled the autumn harvest to be completed ahead of schedule and saved forty-five man-days, greatly encouraging the enthusiasm of the group members for mutual aid and cooperation. In the autumn of 1952, this mutual aid group achieved a large-scale bumper harvest and was rated as a model mutual aid group for bumper harvest in the Southwest Region.

    Before the autumn harvest in 1952, when the mutual aid group was preparing to absorb seven poor farmers who had newly moved in from other villages after the land reform, some group members had the idea of ​​excluding new group members. Zhang Mingliang followed the Party's instructions and correctly carried out collectivist ideology education and class education for the group members. Under his patient explanation, the new and old group members were well united, and the old group members also lent money and food to help the new group members overcome their temporary living difficulties, and guided them to plant tobacco and engage in sideline production.

    After more than two years of struggle and testing, Zhang Mingliang gloriously joined the Chinese Communist Party in August 1952. After that, Zhang Mingliang more actively led the production of the whole group. In the autumn of 1953, the unit area yield of grain in the mutual aid group exceeded the local general yield by 56 percent, and the lives of the group members gradually improved. In order to enable everyone to embark on the happy socialist road, in January of this year, Zhang Mingliang united with two perennial mutual aid groups in the same village to establish the first agricultural production cooperative in the Miao area of ​​Guizhou Province, and Zhang Mingliang was elected as the director of the cooperative.

    When leading the mutual aid group and the production cooperative, Zhang Mingliang cared about the production and living conditions of the group members and cooperative members, and often used his own exemplary actions to influence everyone. For example, during the busy farming season, when everyone was rushing to work, he always let the mutual aid group do other people's work first. When the agricultural production cooperative was first established this year, one evening, Zhang Mingliang and the cooperative members returned from burning grass ash in the mountains, and found that it was going to rain. Regardless of fatigue and the distance at night, he led the cooperative members up the mountain to carry all the grass ash back. In the cooperative, he also gave the two iron hoes and one iron rake awarded to him by the government to three poor cooperative members who lacked farm tools. Recently, Zhang Mingliang has been elected as a member of the Lushan County Miao Autonomous Region People's Government Committee and a member of the CCP Wanchao District Committee.

    苗族共产党员张明亮

    在贵州省高寒的山区，有着许多优秀的共产党员，正在带领山区各族农民逐步组织起来，进行山区的生产改造工作，使贫瘠的山区面貌逐步改观。炉山县苗族自治区苗族共产党员张明亮就是其中的一个。
    张明亮今年四十六岁了，在旧社会里，他在地主的鞭笞下过了四十一年悲惨的生活。一九四九年冬天，这个受尽压迫的雇农才在中国共产党领导下翻了身。
    一九五一年八月，张明亮家乡附近的村庄完成了土地改革。刚分得土地的山区少数民族农民，在生产上有不少困难。这时，张明亮在省里参加了农民代表会，对党的互助合作政策有了些了解，他在党的教育和鼓励下，回到村里后，就动员七户原有互助习惯的苗族农民组织了一个互助组，互助劳动，使秋收提前完成，并节省了四十五个人工，大大鼓舞了组员们互助合作的热情。一九五二年秋，这个互助组获得了大面积丰产，被评为西南区丰产模范互助组。
    在一九五二年秋收前，互助组准备吸收七户在土地改革后新由外村移入的贫苦农民入组时，有些组员有排斥新组员的思想，张明亮遵循着党的指示，正确地向组员进行了集体主义思想教育和阶级教育，在他耐心解释下，新老组员很好地团结了，老组员还借出钱和粮食帮助新组员克服暂时的生活困难，并指导他们种植烤烟和进行副业生产。
    经过了两年多斗争考验的张明亮，在一九五二年八月间光荣地参加了中国共产党。以后，张明亮更加积极领导全组生产。一九五三年秋，互助组谷物单位面积产量超过当地一般产量百分之五十六，组员们的生活也逐渐有了改善。为了使大家走上幸福的社会主义道路，今年一月，张明亮联合了同寨的两个常年互助组成立了贵州省苗族地区第一个农业生产合作社，张明亮被选为社主任。
    张明亮在领导互助组和生产合作社时，都关心组员和社员的生产和生活情况，还经常以自己的模范行动去影响大家。如农忙时节，大家抢活路，他总是让互助组先做别人的。今年农业生产合作社初成立时，一个晚上，张明亮和社员们一起从山上烧草灰回来，发现天会下雨，他不顾疲乏和夜深路远，带领社员们上山把草灰全部挑回。在社里，他还把政府奖给他的两把铁锄和一把铁耙送给三户缺少农具的贫苦社员。最近，张明亮已被选为炉山县苗族自治区人民政府委员会的委员和中共万潮区委员会的委员。
