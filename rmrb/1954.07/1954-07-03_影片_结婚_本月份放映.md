Film "Marriage" to be Screened This Month

The Northeast Film Studio's feature film "Marriage" will be screened in the capital and major cities across the country in July. The original screenplay for this film is Ma Feng's short story "Marriage," adapted by the original author and Chen Ge, with Yan Gong and Gao Heng as directors and assistant directors.

"Marriage" provides a novel style for feature films. The entire film consists of only eight reels, running for just over seventy minutes. The director uses a comedic approach to infect the audience in a relaxed and cheerful atmosphere, allowing them to see the spiritual outlook of the new youth in the countryside, and the excellent quality of putting the public before the private, from the attitude of the main characters, Xiaoqing and Chunsheng, in handling their marriage. Initially, Daqiu went over, paid the public grain, and both sets of parents and the individuals themselves were ready to hold the wedding. However, in order for Xiaoqing to attend the maternal and child health training class and to carry out maternal and child health work in the village after graduation, the wedding date was repeatedly postponed. Even on the final day of going to the district to obtain the marriage certificate, the two were coincidentally held back by some urgent public matters along the way, so it was not until they had finished the matters that the two met at the district office and received their marriage certificate.

Through this short story, the film also allows the audience to see many new things in the countryside today, especially the collectivist spirit growing in some ordinary farmers, with new ideas and new styles gradually replacing the old ideas and styles.

    影片“结婚”本月份放映
    东北电影制片厂故事片“结婚”，七月份在首都及全国各大城市陆续放映。这个电影剧本的原著是马烽的短篇小说“结婚”，由原作者和陈戈改编，导演和副导演是严恭和高衡。
   “结婚”为故事片提供了一种新颖的样式。全部影片只有八本，放映七十余分钟。导演以处理喜剧的手法让观众在轻松愉快的气氛中受到了感染，使观众从影片中主要人物小青和春生料理自己婚事的态度上，看到农村中新青年的精神面貌，和先公后私的优秀品质。起先是大秋过去，交完了公粮，双方家长和本人都准备办喜事了，但是为了小青去参加妇婴卫生训练班，毕业之后要开展本村的妇婴卫生工作，婚期一再拖迟；就是到了最后去区上领结婚证书的那一天，两个人也不约而同地在途中被一些迫不及待的公众的事情牵绊住了，因而直到把事情办完，两个人才在区公所碰头，领到了结婚证书。
    影片通过这个小故事，也使观众看到了今天农村中的许多新事物，尤其是在一些普通农民身上滋长着的集体主义精神，新思想新作风逐渐代替了旧的思想和作风。
