    Wuyuan Green Tea Begins to be Shipped Abroad

    The four thousand seven hundred boxes of green tea meticulously processed by the Jiangxi Provincial State-owned Wuyuan Tea Factory in batches during May and the first half of June have begun to be shipped abroad successively.

      "Wu Green" is a rather important export commodity for our country. In recent years, the output and quality of "Wu Green" have continuously improved. This year, the vast tea farmers adopted the Soviet advanced leaf-retention tea picking method, and some of the crude tea quality reached the special grade standard. This year, the output of "Wu Green" refined tea will increase by 21.43% compared with 1953, of which high and medium-grade tea for export will account for 69.8%. After these teas are exported, they can earn approximately 10,700 tons of steel for the country.

    婺源绿茶开始运往国外
    江西省国营婺源茶厂五月份和六月上半月分批精制的四千七百箱绿茶，已开始陆续运往国外。
      “婺绿”是我国的一项相当重要的出口物资。几年来，“婺绿”的产量和质量不断提高。今年，广大茶农采用苏联先进留叶采茶法，有的毛茶品质达到了特级标准。今年“婺绿”精制茶的产量，将比一九五三年增加百分之二十一点四三，其中外销高中级茶将占百分之六十九点八。这些茶叶出口以后，约可为国家换回钢材一万零七百多吨。
