Xinhua News Agency, 16th. The Soviet "New Times" weekly, in its 26th issue, published an article by Rapacki entitled "American Public Opinion and Indochina." The article points out that the policy of the American warmongering group to intervene in Indochina and expand the war in the Far East has not only failed to gain support on the international stage, but has also been opposed by the broad masses of the American people and even some of the more sober figures in the government.
    The article points to the fact that even within the US government, differences have arisen over the issue of intervention in Indochina. Treasury Secretary Humphrey and Defense Secretary Wilson considered the planned intervention to be too dangerous an adventure. Wilson, who returned after studying the situation in the Far East, delivered a speech. The purpose of this speech was obviously to vent the anger of the State Department leaders and calm down some of the feverish minds in the Pentagon. Because Wilson's speech differed so much from Washington's efforts to establish an interventionist group, most American newspapers made little mention of it.
    The divisions within government circles were also reflected in the "Wall Street Journal." This newspaper is completely sympathetic to the goals of those who want to expand the war. However, it expressed significant doubts about the prospects of such a dangerous adventure as open intervention in Indochina.
    The "Chicago Daily News" put it almost exactly the same way, only more bluntly: "This is a fight we cannot win. …Let's let go!"
    The intervention plan also caused concern among some military personnel, including US Army Chief of Staff Ridgway, who undoubtedly recalled his painful experiences in Korea. "Stone Weekly" pointed out that Ridgway's attitude was based on the consideration that in war, the decisive role still had to be played by the infantry, and the US attempt to transfer the burden to its "allies" would not succeed. In the end, the general American would still have to join the battle, but the American people are unwilling to participate in a war aimed at extinguishing the national liberation movement in Indochina.
    The article continues: Washington's current foreign policy does not have the support of the people. This fact can be particularly seen from the opinions expressed by local newspapers. An article by William McDonnell, editor of the "South Side Economist," bluntly condemned the intervention policy. He wrote: "Congress should tell Dulles to stop his war business or resign. He does not represent the will of the American people." The New Jersey "Hudson Dispatch" had an editorial entitled "Don't Push America into Another Korean War." The "St. Louis Post-Dispatch" said: "The Indochina War should be terminated and not expanded." Many other local newspapers have made similar appeals.
    In many cities, large and small, mass organizations have sprung up to oppose the aggressors' attempts to drag the United States into another war. In Argo, a small city in Illinois, a "Save Our Children Committee" issued a leaflet that read: "Please note, Mr. Dulles, we will never send our sons into another war... There is no problem that cannot be solved through negotiation."
    The feelings of the general American were also reflected in the many letters sent to newspaper offices, radio broadcasting companies, and members of Congress. NBC commentator Alex Dreier asked in one of his broadcasts, "Should we go to Indochina?" He received five thousand responses, most of which opposed another war gamble. New York Republican Congressman Gwinn declared that the vast majority of the seven thousand six hundred voters in his district unconditionally opposed American participation in the Indochina War. In light of the mood of the voters, some members of Congress have criticized Washington's policies.
    The reactionary New York "Daily News" had to admit: "These are certain... American public opinion... is almost unanimously opposed to sending American soldiers to a second, and possibly worse, Korea."

    美国舆论和印度支那
    ——苏联“新时代”周刊发表拉皮茨基的文章的摘要
      【新华社十六日讯】苏联“新时代”周刊第二十六期刊载了拉皮茨基的一篇文章——“美国舆论和印度支那”。文章指出，美国好战集团的干涉印度支那、在远东扩大战争的政策，已不仅在国际舞台上得不到支持，而且遭到了美国国内广大群众以至政府中的某些比较清醒的人物的反对。
    文章指出了甚至在美国政府内部对于干涉印度支那问题也发生了分歧的事实。财政部长汉弗莱和国防部长威尔逊认为计划中的干涉是个太危险的冒险。在远东研究了局势后回国的威尔逊发表一篇演说。这篇演说的目的，显然是想泄一泄国务院领袖们的气，并镇静一下五角大楼的一些发烧的头脑。由于威尔逊的演说和华盛顿建立干涉集团的努力是如此不同道，多数美国报纸都很少提到这篇演说。
    政府圈子内部的分歧也在“华尔街日报”上反映出来。这张报纸是完全同情那些想扩大战争的人们的目标的。但是，它却对公开干涉印度支那这样一个危险的冒险的前途，表示了重大的怀疑。
      “芝加哥每日新闻”说得简直完全一样，只是更率直些：“这是一个我们无法获胜的斗争。……我们撒手吧！”
    干涉计划也在一些军人中间引起了忧虑，其中就有美国陆军参谋长李奇微，他无疑地是回忆到了他在朝鲜的惨痛经验。“斯通周刊”指出，李奇微的态度基于这样的考虑：在战争中，决定性的角色还是要让步兵来担任的，美国想把负担转让到它的“盟国”身上去是不会成功的。最后，一般的美国人还是得参加战斗，但是美国的人民并不愿意去参加目的在于扑灭印度支那的民族解放运动的战争。
    文章接着指出：华盛顿的现行外交政策得不到人民的支持。这一事实特别可以从地方报纸所表露的意见中看出来。“南城经济学家”的编辑威廉·麦克唐奈尔的一篇文章，率直地谴责了干涉政策。他写道：“国会应该告诉杜勒斯停止他的战争买卖，或是辞职。他并不代表美国人民的意愿。”新泽西州的“赫德逊报”有一篇社论的题目是“不要把美国推入另一次朝鲜战争。”“圣路易邮报”说道：“印度支那战争应该终止而不再扩大了。”许多其他的地方报纸也作了类似的呼吁。
    在很多城市，不论大小，都产生了反对侵略分子把美国拖进另一次战争的企图的群众组织。在伊利诺斯州的一个小城市阿哥，一个“拯救我们的孩子委员会”印发了一种传单，写着：“请杜勒斯先生注意，我们决不把我们的儿子送进另一个战争……没有不能经由谈判而解决的问题。”
    一般美国人的感情也在寄给各报馆和无线电广播公司和议员的许多封信中得到了反映。全国广播公司的评论员亚历克斯·德雷尔在他的一次广播中发问道：“我们应不应该到印度支那去？”他收到了五千个回答，其中大多数都表示反对另一次战争赌博。纽约州的共和党议员格温宣称，在他的区域内投票的七千六百名选民，绝大多数无条件地反对美国参预印度支那战争，有鉴于选民的这种情绪，一部分议员已在国会中批评了华盛顿的政策。
    反动的纽约“每日新闻”不得不承认：“这一些是确定的……美国的民意……差不多是一致地反对把美国的兵士送到第二个，而且可能是更坏的一个朝鲜去。”
