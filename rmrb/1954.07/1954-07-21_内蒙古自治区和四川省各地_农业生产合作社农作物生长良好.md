	Agricultural Production Cooperatives in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Sichuan Province
	Experience Good Crop Growth
	The existing and newly established 1,300+ agricultural production cooperatives, combined agricultural and pastoral production cooperatives, and vegetable production cooperatives in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region generally show good growth for crops and vegetables. In the eastern region, the field crops of general agricultural cooperatives are already more than half a foot high, and wheat is more than a foot high. In the western region, field crops of most cooperatives are growing lush and strong, and wheat has already sprouted ears. Over 80% of the cooperatives have better crops than local mutual aid teams and individual farmers.
	The main reasons for the good crops in the agricultural cooperatives are early action and good work. Because land is pooled into the cooperative and labor is uniformly allocated, it is possible to plant suitable crops according to the nature of the land and the season. In Zhaowuda League and the Hetao Administrative Region, wheat planting exceeded the original planned area, and oilseed crop planting was also expanded compared to previous years. In terms of grasping the production season, the Chahar League appropriately advanced the sowing period this year. In Kezuo Middle Banner, Jirem League, the sowing was delayed a few days this year because sowing too early in previous years was unsuitable. Agricultural cooperatives in Zhaowuda League started weeding more than ten days earlier than in previous years. Secondly, because collective labor saves labor and attention is also paid to the reform of production technology. In the eastern region, more than 900 agricultural cooperatives requested that the average fertilized area of each cooperative should account for 44% of the total land area of the cooperative this year, but the fertilized area of agricultural cooperatives in Balin Left Banner, Alukeerqin Banner, Kezuo Right Front Banner, Linxi County, and Tuquan County reached 80% to 90%. Junwang Banner in Yikezhao League, a semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral area, has many manure sources, which were not utilized in the past. This year, all 18 agricultural cooperatives in the banner applied more than 25,200 cartloads of manure, an increase of 48% compared to last year, and the fertilized area accounted for 63% of the total cultivated land area. Where there are water conservancy conditions, they have also been largely utilized for irrigation. Currently, field crops are being weeded for the second time, and wheat has been weeded two to three times.
	Under the impetus and assistance of agricultural cooperatives, the crops of general mutual aid teams and individual farmers are also growing better than in previous years, and production enthusiasm is high. Many mutual aid teams are actively preparing to establish cooperatives after the autumn harvest, and many individual farmers are also preparing to join cooperatives and teams after the autumn harvest.

	Xinhua News Agency: Grain and cotton crops in agricultural production cooperatives in various parts of Sichuan Province are generally growing well. Southern Sichuan Province has a warm climate, and the double-cropping rice planted on a trial basis by various agricultural production cooperatives has reached the harvest season for the early rice crop. It is estimated that yields will generally increase by more than 10% compared to last year. The early rice crop in the Xianfeng Agricultural Production Cooperative in the suburbs of Luzhou City has at least 120 grains per ear. According to experienced elderly farmers, the yield is estimated to be about 700 jin of rice per mu. In Suining Prefecture, the main cotton-producing area, the cotton in 61 agricultural production cooperatives has already formed many flower buds. It is estimated that the yield per unit area may exceed the harvest of the bumper year of 1952. The Licheng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Santai County estimates that each mu can produce 70 jin of ginned cotton.
	This year, agricultural production cooperatives in various parts of Sichuan Province have generally and continuously implemented changes in the farming system and improvements in cultivation techniques under the demonstration and assistance of state-owned farms and agricultural technology extension stations. Throughout the province, 100% of the agricultural production cooperatives have adopted the practice of raising strong rice seedlings, and more than 90% have adopted sparse planting with high density. In terms of rational fertilization, according to a survey of 49 agricultural production cooperatives in Suining Prefecture, the phenomenon of transplanting rice seedlings in white water has disappeared, and the amount of fertilizer applied is generally more than double that of last year. Agricultural production cooperatives in cotton-producing areas have also generally adopted close planting of single cotton plants, and cotton fields planted with improved cotton varieties have expanded to 90%.
	Currently, agricultural production cooperatives in various parts of Sichuan Province are carrying out autumn harvest preparations. Some agricultural production cooperatives have already carried out trial calculations for the autumn distribution and have formulated unified plans for paying agricultural taxes and selling surplus grain or cotton to the state.

    内蒙古自治区和四川省各地
    农业生产合作社农作物生长良好
    内蒙古自治区原有的和新建的一千三百多个农业生产合作社、农牧业结合的生产合作社及蔬菜生产合作社，一般农作物及蔬菜生长很好。东部区一般农业社的大田作物已有半尺多高，小麦已有一尺多高；西部区大部社的大田作物，长的都油绿茁壮，小麦已齐吐麦穗，百分之八十以上的社都比当地互助组和单干农民的庄稼好。
    农业社庄稼好的原因，主要是动手早、做的好。因为土地入了社，劳动力统一分配，能够按土地的性质和节令播种适宜的作物。昭乌达盟、河套行政区的小麦，都超过原计划的播种面积，油料作物也比往年扩大了播种面积。在生产时节的掌握上，察哈尔盟今年适当的提前了播种期，哲里木盟科尔沁左翼中旗，因为往年播种过早不适宜，今年就晚种了几天，昭乌达盟的农业社，铲地比往年早动手十多天。其次，因为集体劳动节省了劳动力，也注意了生产技术的改革。东部区九百多个农业社，要求今年平均每社施肥面积占全社土地总面积的百分之四十四，但巴林左翼旗、阿鲁科尔沁旗、科尔沁右翼前旗、林西县、突泉县的农业社施肥面积，都达到百分之八十到九十。伊克昭盟半农半牧区郡王旗粪源很多，往年不知利用，今年全旗十八个农业社，共上粪二万五千二百多车，比去年增加了百分之四十八，施肥面积占总耕地面积的百分之六十三。有水利条件的地方，也大部利用起来浇了地。目前大田作物正在铲第二遍，小麦已铲完二遍到三遍。
    在农业社的带动、帮助下，一般互助组、单干农民的庄稼也比往年长得好，生产情绪高涨。很多互助组积极准备秋后建社，很多单干农民也准备秋后入社入组。

    四川省各地农业生产合作社的粮、棉作物普遍生长良好。四川省南部气候温暖，各农业生产合作社试种的双季稻，早稻已临收获时节，估计一般可比去年增产一成以上。泸州市郊区先锋农业生产合作社的早稻，每穗至少有一百二十粒，据有经验的老年农民估计，每亩大约可收稻谷七百斤。在主要产棉区遂宁专区，六十一个农业生产合作社的棉花已结上很多花蕾，估计单位面积产量可超过一九五二年大丰收年的收成。三台县里程农业生产合作社估计每亩可产皮棉七十斤。
    今年四川省各地农业生产合作社在国营农场和农业技术推广站的示范和帮助下，普遍连续地实行了改变耕作制度和改进栽培技术。全省各地农业生产合作社采用水稻好种壮秧的达到百分之百，少秧密植的达到百分之九十以上，在合理施肥方面，据遂宁专区四十九个农业生产合作社的调查，白水栽秧的现象已经没有了，而且施肥量一般比去年超过一倍。产棉区的农业生产合作社也普遍采用了棉花单株密植，种植优良棉种的棉田扩大到百分之九十。
    现在四川省各地农业生产合作社正在进行秋收准备工作。有的农业生产合作社已进行秋后分配试算，订出统一缴纳农业税和统一出卖余粮或棉花给国家的计划。（新华社）
