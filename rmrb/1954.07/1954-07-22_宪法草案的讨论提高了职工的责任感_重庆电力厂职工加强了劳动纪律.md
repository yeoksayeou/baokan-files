    Workers at Chongqing Power Plant Strengthened Labor Discipline
    Xinhua News Agency
    Workers at the newly built Chongqing Power Plant have strengthened labor discipline and significantly improved attendance rates during discussions of the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China.
    Since the promulgation of the Draft Constitution, workers at the Chongqing Power Plant have generally heard reports on the Draft Constitution and have engaged in discussions in groups. Articles 1 and 4 of the Draft Constitution have brought tremendous encouragement to the workers. In their speeches, workers generally believed that the Draft Constitution stipulates the establishment of a socialist society in our country, and that the working class, as the leading class of the country, should treat the great cause of building a beautiful socialist society with a master's attitude towards labor. Therefore, many workers deeply felt that it is necessary to strengthen labor discipline in order to fulfill their due responsibilities in the country's socialist industrialization. The young workers, who constitute the vast majority of the plant's workforce, and the new workers from the countryside, have gained a clearer understanding of their tasks after discussions. Zhang Tingying, a material clerk in the thermal workshop, is a young female worker who recently graduated from school. When she first started working, she felt that being a material clerk had no future and was not very settled in her work. During the discussion of the Draft Constitution, she recognized her responsibility in the country's socialist industrialization and felt from her own experience the country's care for young people. She expressed her intention to settle down in her work and exemplarily abide by labor discipline. Zhang Ming and Yang Shufan, workers in the boiler workshop, were rural youths a year ago. When they first started working, they did not understand the importance of abiding by labor discipline. Therefore, they often could not concentrate on their work while on duty. Zhang Ming said in the discussion: "The discussion of the Draft Constitution has raised my class consciousness and made me realize that working in a factory should be like everyone being united as one, and everyone should obey the collective; and I realize that I should treat work with a new labor attitude of being the master of the house."
    After in-depth discussions, workers throughout the plant expressed their intention to support the Draft Constitution with practical actions such as strengthening labor discipline, improving attendance rates, and strengthening safe production. More than thirty groups throughout the plant have formulated guarantee conditions and specific plans, and many new atmospheres have emerged throughout the plant. Yang Tunchang and Chen Yongxin, new workers who were unable to concentrate on production in the past two months, are now working very actively, earnestly implementing operating procedures, not wasting a minute in their work, and exemplarily abiding by labor discipline. Zhang Hongfa's team in the thermal workshop, which was unable to complete its tasks in the past, has completed its production tasks by 20% above quota on July 6th and 7th due to the strengthening of labor discipline and the workers' conscientious responsibility after the discussion of the Draft Constitution. The attendance rate of Shen Xianyin's team in the electrical field reached 99.5% in June. In July, they formulated a plan to ensure that the attendance rate would be increased to 99.7%, and to achieve "three diligences and four fasts" to eliminate various hidden accidents in the electrical workshop. Within July, the entire team will also put forward ten rationalization proposals. This team has already put forward four rationalization proposals. Huang Shengyi's team in the thermal workshop focused on the need to abide by labor discipline, not to be late or leave early, to ensure that the average attendance rate of the entire team reaches 98% in July; and to seriously listen to lectures by Soviet experts, learn all operating procedures well, and ensure that the average test scores of the entire team are above 80 points; the entire team will also put forward three rationalization proposals. This team also issued a friendly challenge to all teams in the plant.

    宪法草案的讨论提高了职工的责任感
    重庆电力厂职工加强了劳动纪律
    新建的重庆电力厂职工在中华人民共和国宪法草案的讨论中，加强了劳动纪律，出勤率有显著提高。
    宪法草案公布以后，重庆电力厂职工已普遍听到了宪法草案的报告，并以小组为单位进行了讨论。宪法草案第一条和第四条给职工们带来了极大的鼓舞力量。职工们在发言中都认为宪法草案已经规定在我国建立社会主义社会，作为国家领导阶级的工人阶级就应该以主人翁的劳动态度来对待建设美好的社会主义社会的伟大事业。因而许多工人都深切感到要加强劳动纪律，才能在国家的社会主义工业化中尽到应尽的责任。占全厂职工绝大多数的青年工人和从农村中来的新工人在讨论后，对自己的任务有了更明确的认识。热工车间材料员张庭英，是一个才从学校出来不久的青年女工，刚参加工作时，她认为做材料员没有前途，不大安心工作。在宪法草案的讨论中，她认清了自己在国家的社会主义工业化中的责任，并从切身体会中感到国家对青年的关怀。她表示要安心工作，模范地遵守劳动纪律。锅炉车间工人张明、杨树藩，在一年以前还是农村青年，刚参加工作时不了解遵守劳动纪律的重要意义，因此，在值班时往往不能专心工作。张明在讨论中说：从宪法草案的讨论中，提高了我的阶级觉悟，认识到在工厂工作应该大家团结得像一个人，人人都要服从集体；并认识到应该以当家作主的新的劳动态度来对待工作。
    经过深入讨论，全厂工人纷纷表示要以加强劳动纪律，提高出勤率，加强安全生产等实际行动来拥护宪法草案。全厂已有三十多个小组订立了保证条件和具体计划，全厂出现了许多新的气象。过去两个月还不能专心生产的新工人杨屯昌、陈永新，现在工作非常积极，认真执行操作规程，工作中一分钟也不浪费，模范地遵守了劳动纪律。过去不能完成任务的热工场张洪发小组，在宪法草案的讨论后，由于加强了劳动纪律，工人们认真负责，在七月六日、七日连续超额百分之二十完成了生产任务。电气场沈贤颐小组六月份出勤率已经达到百分之九十九点五。七月份他们又订出计划，保证要把出勤率提高到百分之九十九点七，并做到“三勤、四快”，消灭电气车间的各种隐形事故。在七月份内，全组还要提出十条合理化建议。目前这个小组已经提出了四条合理化建议。热工车间黄声意小组着重提出了要遵守劳动纪律，不迟到、不早退，保证全组七月份的平均出勤率达到百分之九十八；并认真听苏联专家讲课，学好各项操作规程，保证全组平均测验成绩都在八十分以上；全组还要提出三项合理化建议。这个组并向全厂各小组提出友谊的挑战。　　　　　　　　　　　（新华社）
