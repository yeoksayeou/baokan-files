    Van Fleet Walks Into a Dead End
    Hesheng
    Among the American officials active in the Far East recently, Van Fleet has been one of the busiest. In nearly two and a half months, he has been to the Far East twice, "visiting" South Korea and Taiwan three times; he lingered in Tokyo and also went to Hong Kong for a "tour"; a few days ago, when he returned to the United States for the second time, he detoured to the Philippines. He held many secret talks with American puppets such as Yoshida, Syngman Rhee, and Chiang Kai-shek, and frequently contacted American military personnel in the Far East. He went to the 38th parallel to inspect Syngman Rhee's puppet troops and fortifications, and also "visited" the military facilities on the islands occupied by Chiang Kai-shek's remnants. This makes it very clear that Van Fleet's busy coming and going is an ominous thing!
    Van Fleet keeps silent about why he came to the Far East, but he loves to talk about the manpower problem in the Far East. After his first return to the United States, he said: "It is certain that there (referring to South Korea and Taiwan) there are enough people, and we (the United States) do not need to send our young people to travel half way around the globe." Van Fleet's words were not crisp enough; his superior, U.S. Secretary of Defense Wilson, made it clearer. According to a June 21st "Washington Post" report: Wilson said at a press conference on June 20th: "He expects Van Fleet to bring back a three-year plan for building puppet armies in Taiwan, South Korea, and the Philippines when he returns to the United States from the Far East in July." This more clearly exposes the purpose of Van Fleet's activities in the Far East, which is to implement the plan of "using Asians to fight Asians," intending to reorganize, expand, and train the remnants of Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek, so as to use them as capital for the United States to plan an Asian aggression group.
    In an article titled "The Road to Saving (should be read as invading) Asia" published in the American "Reader's Digest" magazine in February this year, Van Fleet elaborated on the "theory" of "using Asians to fight Asians." Van Fleet said that, based on his "experience," the "best way" to "save" Asia is to let him "train more South Korean troops." He said triumphantly: "One billion US dollars can only maintain four American divisions, but it can cultivate one hundred Asian divisions." He even carefully calculated the soldiers' food expenses. He said: "The food for our (American) soldiers, including all kinds of food, costs one US dollar and twenty cents per soldier per day, and after adding transportation and loss, its value increases to five dollars after arriving in South Korea. The food for the South Korean army costs only forty cents per person." He also said: "Under this plan, as long as the local troops are gradually trained, we (the United States) can recall two or three expensive American divisions from overseas every year." Well, people can probably understand what Van Fleet's "high theory" implies: that is, Asian lives are worthless, and the United States equips them as cannon fodder, which saves money and reduces the sacrifice of American troops. Is there anything cheaper in the world than this!
    Judging from Van Fleet's activities in the Far East, it can be said that he is acting entirely in accordance with this plan of "using Asians to fight Asians." However, the implementation of this American plan is inseparable from the entire Far Eastern situation. And for the current and future Far Eastern situation, Van Fleet does not seem to be very optimistic. According to a June 4th "New York Times" report: After Van Fleet's first return to the United States, he made a report on his trip to the Far East to the American senators, in which he used words such as "gloomy," "depressed," and "disturbing." The newspaper said: "It is said that these words not only apply to the current military situation in the Far East, but also to the future situation there." The awakened Asian people, the Asian people who have rich experience in fighting against American imperialism, have already told Van Fleet with facts that his "road to saving (should be read as invading) Asia" by "using Asians to fight Asians" is a dead end—"this road is blocked"!

    范佛里特走进了死胡同
    禾生
    最近在远东活动的美国官员中，范佛里特要算是最忙的一位了。他在将近两个半月的时间里，曾两度到远东，三次“访问”南朝鲜和台湾；他在东京勾留过，也曾去香港“游览”过；几天前他第二次返回美国时，又去菲律宾绕了个弯。他和吉田、李承晚、蒋介石等美国傀儡举行了很多次秘密会谈，和美国在远东的军事人员频繁地接触。他到三八线去视察过李承晚的伪军和工事，又“参观”了为蒋介石残匪盘踞的海岛上的军事设备。这使人们看得很清楚，范佛里特这样忙忙碌碌，来来去去，是一件不祥的事情！
    范佛里特对于自己为什么前来远东是闭口不谈的，但是，他却爱谈远东的人力问题。他在第一次返回美国后就曾说过：“肯定地说，那里（指南朝鲜和台湾）是有足够多的人口的，我们（美国）不必把我们的青年派到绕过地球一半的地方去。”范佛里特的话还说得不够干脆，他的上司——美国国防部长威尔逊却说得更清楚了。据六月二十一日“华盛顿邮报”报道：威尔逊六月二十日在记者招待会上说：“他预期范佛里特在七月间从远东回美国时，将带回来一个建设台湾、南朝鲜和菲律宾的傀儡军队的三年计划”。这就更明白地说穿了范佛里特到远东来活动的目的，原来就是为了执行“用亚洲人打亚洲人”的计划，打算把李承晚和蒋介石的残兵败将整编、扩充并训练一番，以便当作美国策划亚洲侵略集团的资本。
    范佛里特在今年二月出版的美国“读者文摘”杂志上写过一篇题为“挽救（应读作侵略）亚洲之路”的文章，在这篇文章中，他把“用亚洲人打亚洲人”的“理论”作了详尽的发挥。范佛里特说，根据他的“经验”，“挽救”亚洲的“最好办法”，还是让他“训练更多的南朝鲜军队”。他得意忘形地说：“十亿美元仅能维持四个美国师，但却可以培植起一百个亚洲师。”他甚至连士兵的伙食费都仔细计算过，他说：“我们（美国）士兵的伙食，包括各种食品，一个士兵一天吃的口粮，成本即达美金一元二角，再加运费和耗损，到南朝鲜之后，价值便增到五元。南朝鲜军队的伙食，每人不过四角钱而已。”他并且说：“在这个计划之下，只要各地方的军队逐步训练，我们（美国）每年便可从海外召回两三个费钱的美国师。”好了，范佛里特的“高论”所包含的意思是什么，人们大概可以理解了：那就是亚洲的人命不值钱，美国把他们装备起来当炮灰，既省钱，又可以少牺牲美国军队。世界上还有比这再便宜的事吗！
    从范佛里特在远东活动上看来，可以说他完全是按照这个“用亚洲人打亚洲人”的计划行事的。然而，美国这个计划的推行，是和整个远东局势分不开的。而对于目前的以及将来的远东局势，范佛里特似乎不太乐观。据六月四日“纽约时报”报道：范佛里特在第一次返回美国后向美国参议员们作了一次远东之行的汇报，其中曾用了“黯淡”、“消沉”和“使人不安”等字眼，这个报纸说：
  “据说这些字眼不只适用于目前远东的军事局势，并且适用于那边的将来局势。”觉醒了的亚洲人民，有着丰富的和美帝国主义斗争经验的亚洲人民，已经用事实对范佛里特说，他那“用亚洲人打亚洲人”的“挽救（应读作侵略）亚洲之路”是一条死胡同——“此路不通”！
