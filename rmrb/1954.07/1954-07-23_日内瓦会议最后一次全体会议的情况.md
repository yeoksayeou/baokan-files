Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, July 21st. The Geneva Conference held its final plenary session on the Indochina issue at 3:00 PM on the 21st, chaired by British Foreign Secretary Eden.

After seventy-five days of discussion, the Geneva Conference reached an agreement on the restoration of peace in Indochina, and these agreements have been finalized in the form of documents. The three agreements on the cessation of hostilities in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia were signed on the night of the 20th and noon of the 21st by representatives of the opposing commanders, respectively. These three agreements included agreed terms on the issue of ceasefire supervision in the three countries. At the meeting on the 21st, a final declaration of the Geneva Conference on the Restoration of Peace in Indochina was adopted with the participation of representatives from nine countries. This declaration mentioned: the statement made by the Cambodian delegation regarding the Cambodian government's declaration on universal suffrage and the participation of all citizens in national common life, and the statement on the military situation in Cambodia; the statement made by the Lao delegation regarding the Lao government's declaration on universal suffrage, the participation of all citizens in national common life, and individual guarantees in Phong Saly and Sam Neua provinces, as well as the statement on the military situation in Laos; and the statement made by the French delegation regarding the French government's declaration on respecting the independence of the three Indochinese countries and the statement on the withdrawal of troops from the three Indochinese countries. The above six statements are listed as attachments to the final declaration.

All these agreements, declarations, and statements are in line with the principle of the national rights of the Indochinese people and take into account the interests of France. They not only brought an end to the eight-year Indochina war, bringing peace to the Indochinese and French people, but also have great historical significance for consolidating peace and security in Asia and the world, and for further easing international tensions.

The meeting began with the chairman announcing that photographs would be taken.

After the photography was completed, Tran Van Do, the representative of the State of Vietnam, spoke first.

Tran Van Do said: The delegation of the State of Vietnam had proposed a ceasefire suggestion, which was to disarm all combat troops after they had retreated to the smallest possible assembly areas, and to establish temporary control by the United Nations over all territories, so that Vietnam would not even have a temporary division, and the re-establishment of order and peace would enable the Vietnamese people to decide their future through free elections.

Tran Van Do said: The delegation of the State of Vietnam protests the fact that its suggestion was rejected without examination. This was the only suggestion that respected the wishes of the Vietnamese people. It urgently demands that the demilitarization and neutralization of the Catholic towns in the Bac Bo (Tonkin) delta be at least accepted by this conference. It strongly protests the hasty conclusion of the ceasefire agreement by the commanders-in-chief of France and the Viet Minh, although the French commander-in-chief only commanded the Vietnamese forces with the authorization of the Head of State of Vietnam, and many provisions of this agreement seriously damage the future of the Vietnamese people. It further strongly protests the fact that the ceasefire agreement assigns some territories to the Viet Minh, some of which are still occupied by Vietnamese forces and are still basic areas for defending Vietnam from further Viet Minh aggression. The agreement even practically deprives Vietnam of the inalienable right to organize its own means of defense except for maintaining a foreign army on its territory. It also strongly protests the fact that the French commander-in-chief gladly overstepped his authority to determine the date of future elections without the consent of the State of Vietnam, and we are dealing here with a provision that is clearly of a political nature.

Tran Van Do said, therefore, that the State of Vietnam asks this conference to note that it does indeed strongly protest the way the ceasefire was concluded and the conditions of this agreement that do not take into account the deep wishes of the Vietnamese people. In order to guarantee the sacred rights of the Vietnamese people to territorial integrity, national independence, and freedom, it reserves complete freedom of action.

French Foreign Minister Mendès France then spoke. He said: At this stage of the discussion, the French delegation has no intention of returning to the points implied by the delegation of the State of Vietnam. The French delegation firmly believes that when the French commander-in-chief made his decision in accordance with his responsibilities, he acted within his authority and orders. The French delegation wishes to emphasize here a point of particular importance: it understands and shares the anxiety expressed by the delegation of the State of Vietnam. The French authorities have always respected the beliefs of the people living in the Bui Chu and Phat Diem areas, and agree with their free expression of will. They have never changed this fundamental attitude, even during the war. Following the military decisions, these towns will be subject to a regime different from the one they have always recognized. Regarding the promise of guaranteeing fundamental freedoms – here I am referring to the freedom of conscience mentioned by Mr. Ho Chi Minh – we have firm hope. We hope that these promises will be kept so that these people can continue to live peacefully while respecting their traditional beliefs.

The Chairman said that he thought the Conference would wish to take note of the opinions of the representatives of the State of Vietnam and France.

The Chairman said: Agreements have now been reached on a number of documents, and it is suggested that the Conference should take note of these agreements, so I propose to start by reading out a list of the topics included in these documents. I understand that each delegation already has these documents before them. The Chairman then read out the titles of the documents: (1) Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities in Vietnam, (2) Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities in Lao, (3) Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities in Cambodia.

The Chairman said that he would like to draw particular attention to the fact that these three agreements include texts on the supervision of the ceasefire by international commissions and joint commissions in the three countries after separate consultations. He would also like to draw the attention of all delegations to the important issue of the ceasefire agreement and related maps and supervision documents. All parties have also agreed that these documents will not be published until further agreement is reached by all parties. The Chairman explained that the reason for this was that the ceasefire terms would come into effect on different dates and it was hoped that they would not be published before they came into effect.

The Chairman said that other documents he would like to draw attention to were: (4) the Lao government's statement on elections, (5) the Cambodian government's statement on elections and uniting all citizens in national common life, (6) the Lao government's statement on the military situation in the country, (7) the Cambodian government's statement on the military situation in the country, (8) the French Republic's statement on respecting the independence of the three Indochinese countries, (9) the French Republic's statement on the withdrawal of troops from the three Indochinese countries, and finally, a draft declaration in which the Conference takes note of all these documents. The Chairman said that all delegations had copies of the draft declaration before them. He then asked the representatives of each country to express their opinions on the declaration one by one.

Mendès France, representing the French government, expressed his agreement with the terms of the declaration.

Phoung Sananikone, representing the Royal Lao government, said he had no objection to the text.

Pham Van Dong, representing the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, expressed his agreement.

Zhou Enlai, representing the government of the People's Republic of China, expressed his agreement.

Eden, representing the government of the United Kingdom, endorsed the final declaration of the Conference.

Molotov, representing the Soviet government, also expressed his agreement.

When the chairman asked for the opinion of the Cambodian delegation, Cambodian representative Tep Phan said: The Cambodian delegation wishes to state that there is one document that is not mentioned in the listed documents, namely the draft statement on the final declaration that the Cambodian delegation has distributed to all delegations. Now, Articles 7, 11, and 12 of the final declaration affirm respect for the territorial integrity of Vietnam. The Cambodian delegation requests the conference to consider that this provision does not imply the fact that Cambodia has failed to realize its legitimate rights and interests in the areas of South Vietnam, for which Cambodia has expressed reservations, especially in November 1949, when the Franco-Cambodian Treaty on Cambodian-French relations was signed, it expressed reservations to the French regarding a law linking Cochinchina and Vietnam. Cambodia adheres to the ideals of peace and the international principle of non-interference. If there are some adjustments and provisions regarding the border between the State of Vietnam and Cambodia, which has so far only been determined by unilateral action by France, Cambodia has no intention of interfering in the internal affairs of the State of Vietnam, and is completely faithful to the principle of integrity. While supporting this declaration, Cambodia informs all members of the conference about the land situation of Cambodia in South Vietnam.

Chairman Eden said: If this statement is not written on the list of documents I have read, it is only because I have just received it. I do not think it is part of the task of this conference to deal with any past disputes regarding the Cambodia-Vietnam border.

Pham Van Dong then expressed his agreement with the Chairman's words. He said: I, representing the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, express the most explicit reservations about the statement just made by the Cambodian delegation. Pham Van Dong said, I do this for the benefit of good relations and understanding between our two countries.

Chairman Eden said: I think the conference can take note of the statement just distributed by the Cambodian delegation and the statement by the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

The Chairman then asked for the opinion of the US delegation.

US representative Smith said: As I said to my colleagues at the meeting on July 18, my government is not prepared to participate in the proposed declaration of this conference, but the US government makes the following unilateral statement regarding its position on these issues: "The United States Government is determined, in accordance with the principles and purposes of the United Nations, to work for the strengthening of peace, taking note of the agreements concluded in Geneva on July 20 and 21, 1954 (a) between the commanders of the French-Lao forces and the commanders of the Vietnam People's Army, (b) between the commanders of the forces of the Kingdom of Cambodia and the commanders of the Vietnam People's Army, (c) between the commanders of the French and Vietnamese forces and the commanders of the Vietnam People's Army, and Articles 1 to 12 of the declaration submitted to the Geneva Conference on July 21, 1954, regarding the above agreements, the United States Government declares: (1) In accordance with Article 2, paragraph 4, of the United Nations Charter, which prohibits member states from using the threat or use of force in their international relations, the United States will not use the threat or use of force to undermine these agreements and terms. (2) The United States will follow with full concern any recurrence of aggression that violates the above agreements, and consider it a serious threat to international peace and security."

Regarding the paragraph in the declaration on free elections in Vietnam, my government would like to state the position it has expressed in the Washington Statement of June 29, 1954. In cases where some countries are currently divided against their will, we will continue to seek unification through free elections, monitored by the United Nations to ensure fairness.

Regarding the statement by the representative of the State of Vietnam, the United States reiterates its traditional position that people have the right to determine their own future, and the United States will not participate in arrangements that would prevent this. Nothing in the statement just made is intended to, nor does it express any violation of this traditional position. We also hope that these agreements will allow Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam to play their role in the peaceful family of nations with full independence and sovereignty, and enable the people of the region to decide their own future.

Chairman Eden said: I think the Conference will wish to take note of the statement by the representative of the United States of America.

The Chairman then asked for the opinion of the delegation of the State of Vietnam.

Tran Van Do, the representative of the State of Vietnam, said that regarding the final declaration of this conference, the delegation of the State of Vietnam requests the conference to add the following after Article 10 of the declaration: "The Conference notes the statement of the Government of the State of Vietnam, if agreed, in order to: (1) continue to use all its strength to re-establish a genuine and lasting peace in Vietnam, (2) not use force against the various methods agreed upon for the implementation of the ceasefire, although it has specifically expressed objections and reservations in its final declaration."

Chairman Eden said: I am pleased to hear any opinions that my colleagues wish to express, but, as far as I understand, the final declaration has already been drafted, and these paragraphs to be added were only received just now. And when I received this passage to be added a few minutes ago, the final declaration had indeed already been revised. In any case, I suggest that the best approach we can take is that the conference should take note of the reservations of the State of Vietnam.

Chairman Eden asked if there were any other comments and there were none. He then spoke about some other issues that he believed had to be resolved before the conference concluded its work. He said that the first question was: did our colleagues agree to propose that the two Chairmen send telegrams to the governments of India, Poland, and Canada at the end of the conference, asking them if they were willing to assume the responsibilities of the International Supervisory Commission that the conference was asking them to undertake?

No one expressed any objection.

Chairman Eden then said that the last question was the issue of expenses arising from the decisions of the conference. It was suggested that the two Chairmen put forward some recommendations regarding expenses.

No one expressed any objection.

Eden then spoke as the Chairman of the day's meeting. He said: We have now reached the end of our work. For many reasons, the work has been lengthy and complex. The cooperation that all delegations have given to your two Chairmen has enabled us to overcome many procedural difficulties. Without this cooperation, our task would not have been successful.

The agreements concluded today cannot possibly be something of a nature that is completely satisfactory to everyone, but these agreements make it possible to stop a war that has continued for eight years and has brought disaster and suffering to millions of people. We hope that these agreements will also ease international tensions at a time when world peace is in imminent danger. These results are certainly worth our many weeks of hard work.

In order to facilitate the ceasefire, we have drawn up a series of agreements, which are the best agreements we could have devised. Now everything will depend on the spirit of compliance and implementation of these agreements.

Before we leave this hospitable city of Geneva, I am sure you will want the two Chairmen to write to thank the United Nations and its capable staff, who provided us with meeting venues and assisted our work. Finally, let me express our heartfelt gratitude to the Swiss government and the people and authorities of Geneva, who have done much to make our stay here pleasant and to serve the cause of peace.

US representative Smith then spoke. He said: If I dare to speak for my fellow delegates, it is because I think they all feel the same as I do. I would like them to join me in thanking the two Chairmen of this conference. Their patience and tireless efforts and their sincerity have greatly contributed to making this solution possible. We must be deeply grateful to them.

Molotov then spoke. Molotov said: As one of the chairmen of the Geneva Conference, I would like to respond to Mr. Smith's speech just now praising the work of the two chairmen. Of course, I must emphasize the outstanding work and role of Mr. Eden, the chairman of today. Mr. Eden's role in the Geneva Conference needs no exaggeration. I would also like to thank Mr. Smith for his enthusiastic words.

Tran Van Do, the representative of the State of Vietnam, then spoke. Tran Van Do said: I have expressed the feelings of the delegation of the State of Vietnam in my speech. I hope that this conference will note my speech in its final documents.

The Chairman said: I think I have explained that we cannot now revise our final documents, which are statements by the conference as a whole, but the statement by the representative of the State of Vietnam will be noted.

Chairman Eden asked if anyone had any comments. No one had any comments. Eden then thanked Smith and Molotov for their words. He said that neither of your praises was what I deserved, but even if these words are not correct and when they are good words, it is still very pleasant to hear them. However, I do not want to end the meeting with this sentence. I am very aware that each of us here hopes that the work we have done will help strengthen the forces working for peace.

Molotov said: I think, at the end, we would like to make some closing remarks.

Molotov said:
"Mr. Chairman, Ministers,

The Geneva Conference of Foreign Ministers on Korean and Indochinese issues, convened in accordance with the decision of the Berlin Conference, has completed its work, which has lasted for almost three months.

Thanks to the efforts of the participants, the main goal of the Geneva Conference has been achieved: the task of restoring peace in Indochina has been successfully completed. The agreements adopted by the conference based on the recognition of the national rights of the people of Indochina and taking into account the interests of France can only be regarded as a major victory for the forces of peace and a big step forward on the road to easing international tensions.

Agreements on the implementation of ceasefire in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia have been signed. These agreements ended the eight-year bloody war, and they marked a major victory in the national liberation struggle of the people of Indochina. Today, they have new opportunities to develop their economy and culture under peaceful conditions. These agreements laid the foundation for the development of friendly relations between the French Republic and the Indochinese countries. The people who participated in this meeting have sufficient reasons to be satisfied with the agreements reached.

One cannot fail to recognize that the agreement on restoring peace in Vietnam is of particular importance. This agreement is an international recognition of the national liberation struggle and its great sacrifices and heroism.

At the same time, this agreement, which stipulates the temporary demarcation line between North and South Vietnam, puts forward new and extremely important tasks, that is, to complete the unification of the country as soon as possible under peaceful conditions and in accordance with the national interests of the entire Vietnamese people.

The agreements signed today are of great significance to the people of Asia, where another war has been extinguished. At the same time, these agreements are another major step towards consolidating peace and developing international cooperation.

The Geneva Conference lasted for nearly three months. Today we know what the conference has accomplished and what it has not been able to accomplish.

In this regard, it is necessary to recall that the Korean issue remains to be resolved in accordance with the interests of Korean national unification.

The study of the Indochina issue at this conference went through two stages. We all remember the difficulties encountered in the first stage of the conference. But these difficulties were overcome. We must not underestimate the contribution made by the delegations of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and France during the conference to overcome these difficulties. The negotiations provided an opportunity to promote mutual understanding, and at the same time, the parties concerned showed sincerity here, which is of great significance. In the course of the meeting, the participants found it possible to bring their views closer and make concessions to each other, so that the negotiations could be successful.

However, if the US delegation did not fully participate in all this complicated work with other participants and adopted a special position, then we all know this.

On the other hand, the Geneva Conference showed that the participation of the People’s Republic of China has a huge positive and important role in solving urgent international problems. The process of this meeting shows that the artificial obstacles set by the aggressive groups of certain countries that are still setting up obstacles to China’s participation in solving international problems have been swept away by life itself.

The Geneva Conference shows that, under certain conditions, the path of negotiations by the countries concerned can produce results that conform to the interests of the people and the needs of strengthening world peace. The results of the Geneva Conference prove that the principle observed in the entire diplomatic policy of the Soviet Union is correct. This principle is that in the current international situation, there are no contentious issues that cannot be resolved through negotiations and agreements aimed at strengthening peace. People everywhere will recognize this.

Today, the news of the agreement reached at the Geneva Conference will spread all over the world. The success achieved by the Geneva Conference is in line with the interests of all peace-loving people and in line with the interests of peace and the freedom of all peoples. I believe that these agreements and the important results of the Geneva Conference will strengthen the will and efforts of the people of all countries to further ease international tensions and further consolidate peace."

Pham Van Dong then spoke. "Mr. Chairman, Honorable Ministers, the Geneva Conference is about to end, and the agreements have been signed, which will enable the cessation of hostilities in Indochina.

This is a great victory for the people of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the people of Indochina, the French people, and the people of Asia. It is a great victory for the peace-loving people of all countries. This is a great victory for peace.

The successful conclusion of the Geneva Indochina Conference once again proves that it is possible to resolve all international disputes—even the most serious international conflicts—through negotiation. Achieving peace in Indochina on the basis of recognizing the national rights of the people of Indochina is a victory for the oppressed peoples, who hold high the banner of fighting for national independence and democratic freedom.

On behalf of the people and government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam expresses its deep gratitude to the participating countries and to all the peace-loving people and governments of all countries that have made their respective contributions to peace. Our people have been fighting bravely for peace for eight years.

We have taken a big step forward, but we still need to continue to work hard. We still need to establish a stable and lasting peace in Indochina by resolving various political issues. Among these political issues, the first is through elections, that is to say, to achieve the national unity of our people through peaceful and democratic means.

On the other hand, we still need to rebuild our country, which has been devastated by a long-term war, to continue and further realize various democratic freedoms, including freedom of religion and belief, and to develop the economy and culture, and all this is to improve the material and cultural living standards of our people.

To complete these tasks that have already been placed before us, we need the sympathy, support, and assistance of our friends, and we need to cooperate with the people of Southeast Asia and Asia on the basis of mutual territorial sovereignty, non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs, equality, mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence. And we need to establish good relations with all countries in the world.

In particular, it is necessary to establish relations with France, a country known for its great tradition of freedom. The Democratic Republic of Vietnam warmly hopes to establish trusting and friendly relations with it. This relationship is very necessary for restoring peace in Indochina and for resolving all issues related to restoring peace in Indochina. We are willing to establish economic and cultural relations with France on the basis of equality and mutual benefit.

We need peace to unify our country and start building our country. We will faithfully and strictly implement all the terms of the agreements we have signed. We hope that other relevant parties will do the same. We all need to maintain and consolidate the peace we have just won. We miss our people with excitement. They loved their motherland during the war and gave their lives for their motherland, and they will do the same in the current period of peace. The conference has stipulated a date for the unification of our country. We will make unification a reality. We will win unification as we have already won peace. No force in the world—whether domestic or foreign—can make us leave the path of unification through peace and democracy. Unification will complete our national independence.

Vietnamese people! Compatriots in the south, victory belongs to us! The independence and unity of our motherland are in our hands. All the peace-loving and just people in the world are united with us. Please remember Chairman Ho Chi Minh's words: the struggle is arduous, but the final victory belongs to us.

Long live peace!
Long live the unification of our motherland!"

Zhou Enlai then spoke. (The full text is on page one of yesterday's newspaper)

Lao representative Phoung Sananikone then spoke. Phoung Sananikone said: My delegation fully endorses what Mr. Smith said on behalf of the United States regarding the effective work of our two chairmen throughout the conference, and expresses its thanks for the excellent cooperation of the Swiss government and the United Nations. We would like to express our views on the work of the meeting, which is now coming to an end. The forces of peace have triumphed. The ceasefire has allowed the war-torn people to recuperate and find peace. We know that final peace is only a word established in people’s minds, and the signing of the ceasefire has created a favorable atmosphere for reconciliation and understanding. Therefore, the first step has been taken, and we are very happy about this. For the Kingdom of Laos, this is a most important day, and it is also a day that will be missed. We are satisfied with the cooperation of the major countries that have contributed to this satisfactory result. We are most satisfied with the French delegation’s unremitting efforts and contributions since the Berlin Conference to follow the direction of the agreements reached here, regardless of all obstacles and difficulties. The Kingdom of Laos also hopes to explain and express: although it is peaceful, it is also vigilant. It hopes that this conference will prove the fact that international negotiations can achieve results and understanding without harming the dignity and security of peace, and still show a considerable degree of reconciliation. If the victory of realistic views is shown in this work, it will also help freedom and justice.

Cambodian representative Tep Phan then spoke. He said, I do not want to return to the issues of the meeting, which is now coming to an end, such as discussing the origins of the war. However, at the end of our long and difficult task, it can be said that this conference has indeed achieved the goals it set for itself three months ago. This goal is to rebuild peace in Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam. If true peace has not yet been achieved in the three countries of Indochina, we have also stopped the tragic bloodshed that has been going on for the past eight years. It may be difficult to use the words "complete success" here, because the solutions reached cannot satisfy all parties concerned. But I can say that because the long and painful war has ended, the whole world can breathe a sigh of relief. We particularly sympathize with the State of Vietnam. We have heard solemn protests, which deeply moved us. We have a clear conscience, have contributed to the work of this conference, and have found solutions through everyone’s sincerity. We believe that we have assisted the work of this conference, because our cause is just, and we hope to make this contribution in a constructive spirit, in a way that can rebuild and strengthen peace, which is what every people in that part of the world wants. As far as we are concerned, our ideals have always been clear and firm. If I may say so, we have shown some spirit of reconciliation. We raised our case at the beginning of this conference, and we applied the methods of peaceful understanding and frankness to our negotiations. Therefore, we noticed that our views were gradually agreed upon by other members of this conference. If sometimes we seemed a little harsh in our demands, it was because the cause of our country is just, and therefore it is necessary for everyone to recognize and respect it for the benefit of our country and for the benefit of the whole world.

Now we have achieved our results. Because we are at the end of a difficult task, in addition to feeling satisfied, my delegation is willing to thank all the delegations for their understanding, especially the understanding shown in our private negotiations in the last few days. I am very sure that if everyone had not shown determination and sincerity, we would not have achieved the results we have now achieved. Because we have set an end date, and because the Cambodian delegation raised some issues at the last moment, some people criticized Cambodia for delaying the signing of the agreement by a few hours. I would like to state that we are not responsible for this delay. We have done our best to promote the resolution of the problem. If it was still delayed by a few hours despite our efforts, it was because we had to raise a few questions to the conference. When we had some reservations, we tried our best to shorten the delay.

At the moment when the governments here reached an agreement on the ceasefire in the three countries of Indochina, I, on behalf of the government of the Kingdom of Cambodia, express a sincere wish: the spirit of understanding and reconciliation in our consultations and negotiations will continue to be expressed when the agreement is implemented. At the beginning of our consultations, our problem was difficult. And because we used patience and understanding to facilitate the solution, we succeeded. Therefore, the most important task of this conference has been resolved. The spirit of reconciliation must be maintained, and when peace is implemented, this spirit will become a reality. Therefore, my delegation is willing to express its heartfelt gratitude to everyone, and state that the government of the Kingdom of Cambodia will implement the agreement in a spirit of understanding and full tolerance.

Mendès France spoke. After expressing his gratitude to the Swiss authorities and the services of the United Nations, he said that the French delegation participated in the work of this conference in the spirit so aptly described by the two chairmen. The task assigned to us here by the Berlin Conference was a difficult one, namely, to restore peace in Indochina. Now we have completed this task. The completion of the task was possible because everyone showed a spirit of reconciliation throughout the negotiations. Without this spirit, no agreement could be reached. The peace that has now been established is not a perfect peace. To achieve a perfect peace, we need to continue to work hard, that is to say, we need to rely on all of us. But it will be strengthened every day, if the spirit of reconciliation shown here can be maintained and supported. If peace is indeed strengthened, as the French delegation sincerely and firmly hopes, then the results of our peace efforts this time will go far beyond the borders of Indochina and will lead the world to happiness and to the recovery that the people of the world, who are eagerly awaiting it, truly need.

Chairman Eden announced the adjournment of the Geneva Conference at 5:20 PM after thanking everyone.

    日内瓦会议最后一次全体会议的情况
    【新华社日内瓦二十一日电】日内瓦会议在二十一日下午三时举行关于印度支那问题的最后一次全体会议，由英国外交大臣艾登担任主席。
    在经过七十五天的讨论以后，日内瓦会议已就恢复印度支那和平问题达成了协议，这些协议已以文件的形式加以最后确定。关于在越南、老挝、柬埔寨三国停止敌对行动的三个协定，已经在二十日夜和二十一日中午由交战的双方司令部的代表分别签字，在这三个协定中包含有对三国停战监察问题的协议条款。在二十一日的会议上通过了一项由九国代表参加的关于恢复印度支那和平问题的日内瓦会议的最后宣言。在这个宣言中提到了：柬埔寨代表团发表的、柬埔寨政府关于普选和一切公民参加国家共同生活的声明和关于柬埔寨国内军事形势的声明，老挝代表团发表的、老挝政府关于普选、一切公民参加国家共同生活和在丰沙里和桑怒两省个人保证的声明，以及关于老挝国内军事形势的声明，法国代表团发表的、法国政府关于尊重印度支那三国独立的声明以及关于自印度支那三国撤军的声明。上述六个声明均列为最后宣言的附件。
    所有这些协定、宣言和声明，都符合于印度支那人民民族权利的原则并照顾了法国的利益。它们不但使八年的印度支那战争得以结束，为印度支那人民和法国人民带来和平，而且对巩固亚洲及世界的和平与安全，对进一步缓和国际紧张局势，有着重大的历史意义。
    会议开始，主席宣布进行摄影。
    摄影完毕后，越南国代表陈文杜首先发言。
    陈文杜说：越南国代表团曾提出一项停战建议，该建议是要通过在一切交战军队撤退到尽可能小的集结地区后，解除他们的武装，并由联合国在全部领土上建立临时控制，使越南连暂时的分治都没有，而秩序与和平的重新建立将能使越南人民通过自由选举决定他们的未来。
    陈文杜说：越南国代表团抗议下一事实，即它的建议未经审查即遭拒绝，这是唯一尊重越南人民愿望的建议，它迫切地要求北越三角洲的天主教乡镇的非军事化和中立化是至少应为本会议接受的。它严重抗议法国和越盟的总司令部仓促缔结停战协定，虽然法国总司令部只是通过越南国元首的授权而指挥越南部队的，而这个协定的很多规定是严重损害越南人民的将来的。它并进一步对下一事实严重地提出抗议，即停战协定将一些领土归于越盟，而其中有些仍然在越南部队占领之下，并且还是对保卫越南使之不受越盟更大侵略的基本地区。该协定甚至于实际上剥夺了越南除在它领土上保持一支外国军队而外组织它自己防御手段的难以废除的权利。它并严重抗议下一事实，即法国总司令部未得越南国同意而欣然越权确定未来选举的日期，而我们是在这里处理一项显然是政治性质的规定。
    陈文杜说，因此越南国要求本会议注意，它的确严重抗议缔结停战的方式，和不考虑越南人民深切愿望的这一协定的条件。为了保障越南人民领土统一、民族独立和自由的神圣权利，它保留行动的完全自由。
    法国外交部部长孟戴斯—弗朗斯接着发言。他说：在讨论的这一阶段，法国代表团无意回到越南国代表团暗指的诸点。法国代表团坚信，当法国总司令部按其责任作出决定时，它是按照它的职权和命令行动的。法国代表团愿意在这里强调有特别重要性的一点，它了解并分有越南国代表团所表示的焦虑，法国当局一直尊重住在裴朱和发艳地区的人民的信仰，并赞成他们自由表示意志。他们从没有，甚至在战争期间也没有改变这一基本的态度。随着军事性质的决定以后，这些乡镇要从属于一个不同于他们所一直承认的那种政权。关于保障基本自由的允诺——这里我是指胡志明先生所提及的良心自由——我们有坚定的希望。我们希望这些允诺将被遵守，从而使这些人民在尊重他们传统信念中继续和平地生活下去。
    主席说，他想本会议将愿注意到越南国代表和法国代表的意见。
    主席说：现在对若干文件已达成协议，经建议，本会议应注意到这些协议，因此我提议先开始宣读一张这些文件所包括的题目的清单，我了解每一个代表团面前都已有了这些文件。主席接着宣读文件题目：（一）越南停止敌对行动协定，（二）老挝停止敌对行动协定，（三）柬埔寨停止敌对行动协定。
    主席说，他愿意特别提请注意这一事实，即这三个协定包括有关于经分别协商关于在三国内由国际委员会和联合委员会监察停战的文本。他也愿意提请所有代表团注意关于停战协定和有关地图及监察问题的文件的也属重要的问题，各方面也已同意，在各方面达成进一步协议之前，这些文件均不予以公布。主席解释说，这样做的理由是：这些停战条款将在不同的日期生效，希望在生效之前它们不应予以公布。
    主席说，他愿意提请大家注意的其他文件是：（四）老挝政府关于选举的声明，（五）柬埔寨政府关于选举和将全体公民统一在全国共同生活中的声明，（六）老挝政府关于该国军事状况的声明，（七）柬埔寨政府关于该国军事状况的声明，（八）法兰西共和国关于尊重印度支那三国独立的声明，（九）法兰西共和国关于自印度支那三国撤出军队的声明，最后还有本会议注意到所有这些文件的宣言草案。主席说，所有各代表团面前都有该宣言草案的副本。他接着请各国代表一一表示对该宣言的意见。
    孟戴斯—弗朗斯代表法国政府表示同意该宣言的条款。
    冯·萨纳尼空代表老挝王国政府表示对该文本没有意见。
    范文同代表越南民主共和国政府表示同意。
    周恩来代表中华人民共和国政府表示同意。
    艾登代表联合王国政府表示赞同会议的最后宣言。
    莫洛托夫代表苏联政府也表示同意。
    当主席询问柬埔寨代表团的意见时，柬埔寨代表泰普潘说：柬埔寨代表团希望说明在列出的这些文件中有一件没有提到，那就是柬埔寨代表团已经分发给所有代表团的、关于最后宣言的声明草案。现在最后宣言的第七、十一、十二各条确立了对越南领土完整的尊重，柬埔寨代表团要求会议认为这一规定并未暗示下面的事实，即在南越的地区方面柬埔寨未能实现其合法权利和利益，对此柬埔寨曾表示保留，特别是在一九四九年十一月关于柬法关系的法国—柬埔寨条约签订的时候曾对法国方面将交趾支那和越南联接起来的一项法律表示过保留。柬埔寨遵守着和平的理想和互不干涉的国际原则，假如对于迄今只是由于法国片面行动所确定的越南国和柬埔寨之间的边界作某些调整和规定的话，柬埔寨无意干涉越南国的内政，并完全忠实于完整的原则。柬埔寨在支持本宣言的同时，通知会议所有成员关于柬埔寨在南越的土地情况。
    主席艾登说：假如这一声明没有写在我所宣读的文件清单上，那只是因为我现在才收到，我不认为处理任何关于柬—越之间边界的过去争端是本会议任务的一部分。
    范文同接着表示同意主席的话。他说：我代表越南民主共和国政府对柬埔寨代表团刚才所作的声明，提出最明白的保留。范文同说，我这样做是为了我们两国之间的良好关系和谅解的利益。
    主席艾登说：我想本会议可以注意到柬埔寨代表团刚才分发的声明和越南民主共和国代表团的声明。
    主席接着询问美国代表团意见。
    美国代表史密斯说：如我在七月十八日会议上对我的同事们所说的一样，我的政府不准备参与所提出的本会议的宣言，但是美国政府对于它在这些问题上的立场作下述单方面的声明：“美国政府决心按照联合国的原则和目的，致力于加强和平，注意到了一九五四年七月二十日及二十一日在日内瓦（甲）法国—老挝部队司令部和越南人民军司令部之间、（乙）柬埔寨王国部队司令部和越南人民军司令部之间、（丙）法越军司令部和越南人民军司令部之间所缔结的协定及一九五四年七月二十一日提交日内瓦会议的宣言中所包含的第一到第十二条关于上述各协定的条款，美国政府声明：（一）按照联合国宪章第二条第四款关于各会员国在其国际关系上不得使用威胁或武力的规定，美国将不使用威胁或武力去妨害这些协定和条款。（二）美国将充分关切地注视违反上述协定的任何侵略的再起，并认为这是严重威胁国际和平和安全的。”
    关于宣言中关于越南自由选举的一段，我的政府愿意说明它已在一九五四年六月二十九日华盛顿声明中表达过的立场，在一些国家目前违反它们的意志被分割的情况下，我们将继续通过由联合国监察以保证公平进行的自由选举，来寻求获得统一。
    关于越南国代表的声明，美国重申它的传统立场，即：人民有权决定他们自己的前途，而美国将不参加会阻止这一点的安排。刚才所作的声明中无意、也未表示任何对这一传统立场的违反。我们也同样希望这些协定将允许柬埔寨、老挝和越南以充分的独立和主权，在各国的和平大家庭中起他们的作用，并能使该地区人民决定他们自己的前途。
    主席艾登说：我想本会议将愿意注意到美利坚合众国代表的声明。
    主席接着询问越南国代表团的意见。
    越南国代表陈文杜说，关于本会议的最后宣言，越南国代表团要求本会议在该宣言第十条后面加上下述内容：“本会议注意到越南国政府的声明，若予以同意，以便：（一）继续以一切力量在越南重新建立真正和持久的和平，（二）不使用武力反对所达成的实施停火的各种方法，虽然在其最后宣言中特别表达了反对意见和保留意见。”
    主席艾登说：我高兴听取我的同事们所愿意表达的任何意见，但是，据我所了解的情况，最后宣言已经草拟好了，而要附加的这些段是刚才收到的。而当我在数分钟前接到要附加的这段时，最后宣言的确已经修正好了。在任何情况下，我建议我们能够采取的最好方法是本会议应注意到越南国的保留意见。
    主席艾登经征询而没有其他的意见后，谈到他认为本会议结束工作前必须予以解决的某些其他问题。他说，第一个问题是：我们的同事们是否同意，提议两位主席在本会议结束时致电印度、波兰和加拿大政府，征询他们是否愿意承担本会议要求他们承担的国际监察委员会的责任？
    没有人表示反对意见。
    主席艾登又说，最后一个问题是由于会议的决定所产生的开支问题，兹建议由两位主席提出关于费用的一些建议。
    没有人表示反对。
    艾登接着以当天会议的主席的身份致词。他说：我们现在到达我们工作的结束的时候了。为了很多理由，工作是拖长了，并且是复杂的。所有代表团给予你们的两位主席的合作，使得我们能够克服很多程序上的困难，没有这种合作，我们的任务是不能成功的。
    今日缔结的协定不可能是具有对于每个人都完全满意的性质的东西，但是这些协定使停止继续了八年并带给数百万人民灾难和痛苦的战争成为可能，我们希望这些协定在对世界和平有迫切危险的时刻也缓和了国际紧张局势，这些结果当然对我们很多星期的繁重工作是值得的。
    为了促成停火，我们已拟定了一系列的协议，它们是我们所能策划出的最好的协议，现在一切将有赖于遵守和执行这些协定时的精神。
    在我们离开日内瓦这个好客的城市之前，我确信你们会希望两位主席致函感谢联合国和其能干的工作人员，他们供给我们会场并协助了我们的工作。最后让我表示我们对瑞士政府和日内瓦人民及当局的衷心感谢，他们做了很多事情使我们在此间的居留愉快，并为和平事业服务。
    美国代表史密斯接着发言。他说：假如我敢于为我的各位代表同僚说话，那是因为我认为他们都有和我一样的感觉。我希望他们同我一起向本会议两位主席致谢，他们的耐心和不倦的努力以及他们的诚意大大有助于使这个解决成为可能，我们必须衷心感谢他们。
    莫洛托夫接着发言。莫洛托夫说：作为日内瓦会议主席之一，我愿意回答史密斯先生刚才赞扬两位主席的工作的发言。当然我必须强调今天的主席艾登先生所作的杰出的工作和作用。艾登先生在日内瓦会议中的作用是无需夸张的。我也愿意感谢史密斯先生的热情言辞。
    越南国代表陈文杜接着发言。陈文杜说：我在我的发言中曾表示了越南国代表团的感觉，我希望本会议在它的最后文件中注意我的发言。
    主席说：我想我已经解释过，我们现在不能修改我们的最后文件，那是会议作为一个整体的声明，但是越南国代表的声明将被注意到。
    主席艾登问大家有无任何意见。大家没有意见。艾登接着对史密斯和莫洛托夫的话表示感谢。他说，两位的称赞都不是我理所应得的，但是即使这些话不是正确的而当它们是好话的时候，听到时还是很高兴的。但是，我并不想以这一句话结束会议，我十分知道，这里我们每一个人都希望我们所做的工作将协助加强为和平而工作的力量。
    莫洛托夫说：我想，在最后的时候，我们愿作
  一些结束语。
    莫洛托夫说：
  “主席先生，部长先生们：
    根据柏林会议的决定而召开的研究朝鲜和印度支那问题的日内瓦外长会议，已完成了它的几乎进行了三个月之久的工作。
    由于与会者的努力，日内瓦会议的主要目的已经达到：恢复印度支那和平的任务已经成功地完成了。会议通过基于承认印度支那人民的民族权利和考虑到法国的利益的协定，只能被认为是和平力量的重大胜利，是向缓和国际紧张局势的道路上走了
  一大步。
    关于在越南、老挝和柬埔寨实行停火的协定已经签订了。这些协定结束了历时八年的流血战争，它们标志着印度支那人民的民族解放斗争的一项重大胜利。今天，他们有了在和平的条件下发展经济和文化的新的机会。这些协定为法兰西共和国和印度支那国家之间的友好关系的发展打下了基础。参加这次会议的人有充分的理由对达成的协议表示满意。
    人们不能不认为关于恢复越南和平的协定是具有特别重要意义的。这一协定是对民族解放斗争和它的伟大的牺牲和英雄主义的一种国际上的承认。
    同时，这个规定了越南北部和南部之间的暂时分界线的协定提出了新的极为重要的任务，这就是在和平条件下、在符合全体越南人民的民族利益的情况下尽早完成国家的统一。
    今天所签订的协定对于亚洲人民说来，是具有巨大的重要性的，在那里，又一片战火被扑灭了。同时这些协定是朝着巩固和平和发展国际合作迈进的又一大步。
    日内瓦会议进行了将近三个月。今天我们知道会议完成了什么，还有什么没有能完成。
    在这方面，有必要追述一点，这就是朝鲜问题仍然有待根据朝鲜国家统一的利益加以解决。
    这次会议上对印度支那问题进行的研究经过两个阶段。我们大家都记得会议的第一个阶段所遭到的困难。但是这些困难被克服了。我们决不能过低估计越南民主共和国代表团和法国代表团在会议期间为了克服这些困难而作出的贡献。谈判提供了促进彼此谅解的机会，同时有关双方在这里也表现了诚意，这个事实是具有重大意义的。在会议过程中，与会者发现有可能使他们的主张更趋接近，互相让步，从而使谈判得到成就。
    但是，如果说美国代表团没有和其他与会者一起充分参加这一切复杂的工作，而采取了一种特殊的立场，那么我们大家都是知道这一点的。
    另一方面，日内瓦会议表明，在解决紧急的国际问题方面，中华人民共和国的参加是有着巨大的积极的重要作用的。这次会议的进程表明，某些国家的侵略集团仍在设置的阻挠中国参加解决国际问题的人为障碍，已经被生活本身扫除了。
    日内瓦会议表明，在一定条件下，由有关国家进行谈判的道路是可以产生符合于人民的利益、符合于加强世界和平的需要的结果的。日内瓦会议的结果证明苏联全部外交政策中所遵守的原则是正确的，这个原则是：在目前国际局势中没有任何争执问题是不可以通过目的在于加强和平的谈判和协议来解决的。各个地方的人都将会认识到这一点。
    今天，日内瓦会议达成协议的消息将传遍全世界。日内瓦会议获得的成功是符合于一切爱好和平的人民的利益的，符合于和平和各国人民自由的利益的。我相信这些协议和日内瓦会议的重要结果将加强各国人民进一步缓和国际紧张局势、进一步巩固和平的意志和努力。”
    范文同接着发言。“主席先生，诸位部长先生，日内瓦会议即将结束，各项协定已经签署完毕，这些协定将使在印度支那的敌对行动得以结束。
    这是越南民主共和国人民、印度支那各国人民、法国人民和亚洲人民的一个伟大的胜利，是各国爱好和平的人民的一个伟大的胜利。这是和平的一个伟大的胜利。
    日内瓦印度支那问题会议的圆满结束，再一次证明了，通过谈判方式解决一切国际争端——即使是最严重的国际冲突——是可能的。在承认印度支那各国人民的民族权利的基础上达成印度支那的和平，是被压迫的各国人民的一个胜利，他们高举着为民族独立和民主自由而斗争的旗帜。
    越南民主共和国代表团代表越南民主共和国人民和政府向与会各国，向所有对和平各自作了贡献的爱好和平的各国人民和政府，表示深切的感激，我们的人民八年以来已为和平作了英勇的斗争。
    我们已迈进了一大步，但是，还需要继续努力。我们还需要通过解决各项政治问题来在印度支那建立稳定而持久的和平，在这些政治问题中首先是通过选举，就是说通过和平与民主的道路来实现我们的人民的国家统一。
    在另一方面，我们还需要建设长期受战争摧残的我国，继续和更进一步实现各项民主自由，其中包括宗教与信仰的自由，还要发展经济和文化，而这一切都是为了提高我国人民的物质和文化生活的水平。
    要完成已经摆在我们面前的这些任务，我们需要我们的朋友们的同情、支持和援助，而且需要和东南亚与亚洲各国人民在相互尊重领土主权、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利和和平共处的基础上进行合作，并且还要和全世界所有的国家建立良好的关系。
    特别是要和法国建立关系，法国是以伟大的自由传统著称的国家，越南民主共和国热烈地希望与它建立信任和友好的关系，这种关系对于恢复印度支那和平，对于解决有关恢复印度支那和平的一切问题，都是非常必要的。我们愿意在平等互利的基础上与法国建立经济和文化关系。
    我们需要和平来统一我们的国家，并着手建设我们的国家。我们将忠实而严格地执行我们已签署的协定的一切条款。我们希望其他有关各方也将如此。我们都需要维持和巩固刚刚获得的和平。我们在激动的心情中思念我国人民，他们在战时热爱他们的祖国并为祖国奋不顾身，他们在眼前的和平时期中也将如此。会议已为我国的统一规定了一个日期。我们将使统一实现，我们将像已经赢得和平那样赢得统一。世界上没有任何力量——不论是国内的还是国外的力量——能使我们离开通过和平和民主走向统一的这条道路。统一将完成我们的民族独立。
    越南人民！南部的同胞们，胜利是属于我们的！我们祖国的独立和统一都由我们掌握着。全世界爱好和平与正义的人们都是与我们同心一致的。请你们记住胡志明主席的话：斗争是艰苦的，但是最后胜利是属于我们的。
    和平万岁！
    我们祖国的统一万岁！”
    周恩来接着发言。（全文见昨日本报一版）
    老挝代表冯·萨纳尼空接着发言。冯·萨纳尼空说：我的代表团完全赞同史密斯先生代表美国对我们两位主席在整个会议期间的有效工作所说的话，并向瑞士政府和联合国的卓越的合作表示谢意。我们愿意对现在即将结束的会议的工作表示我们的意见。和平力量战胜了，停战使受战争打击的人们获得休养生息和安宁。我们知道，最后和平只是人的脑海中确立的字样而已，而停战的签订创造了调和与谅解的有利气氛，因此，第一步已经做到了，我们对此非常高兴。对老挝王国来说，这是一个最重要的一天，也是会使大家怀念的一天，我们对于对这一满意结果有所贡献的各大国的合作表示满意，我们最满意法国代表团自柏林会议后就不顾一切阻挠和困难、按照在这里达成的协议的方向所作的一直未停止的不屈不挠的努力和贡献。老挝王国也希望说明并表示：它虽是和平的，同样也是警惕的，它希望本会议证明这一事实，即：国际谈判是可能达成结果和谅解的，而不损害和平的庄严和安全，仍同样表示出了相当程度的某种和解。假如在这件工作上显出了现实看法的胜利，那也是有助于自由与正义的。
    柬埔寨代表泰普潘接着发言。他说，我不希望回到现在已近结束的会议的问题上去，譬如说，讨论战争起源问题。但是，在我们长期而困难的任务结束时，可以说本会议的确达到了它三个月前指定给它自己的目的。这个目的就是在柬埔寨、老挝和越南重建和平。假如真正的和平尚未在印度支那三国中获得的话，我们也已停止了在最近八年中进行的悲惨流血。可能在这里使用“完全成功”的字样是困难的，因为达成的解决还不能使有关各方满意。但我可以说因为结束了长期而痛苦的战争，全世界都能喘息一下了。我们特别同情越南国，我们听到了庄严的抗议，使我们深为感动。我们无愧于心，对本会议的工作有所贡献，并由于大家的诚意，找到了解决办法。我们相信我们协助了本会议的工作，因为我们的事业是正义的，我们希望能够以建设性的精神、以世界该部分每个人民所希望的能够重建和加强和平的方法，来作出这一贡献。就我们而论，我们的理想永远是明确而坚定的。假如我可以这样说的话，我们曾表示了某种和解精神。我们在本会议一开始时就提出了我们的事件，我们并把和平谅解和坦白的方式应用于我们的谈判，因此我们注意到我们的意见逐渐为本会议其他成员所同意。假如有时在我们的要求上我们似乎有些苛刻，那是因为我们国家的事业是正义的，因此为了我国的利益、为了全世界的利益，每个人都有必要予以承认和尊重。
    现在我们获致了我们的结果。因为我们处于困难任务的结束的时刻，除了感到满意外，我的代表团愿意感谢所有代表团表现的谅解，特别是在最后几天我们私下谈判中表示的谅解。我十分肯定：假如每个人没有表现决心和诚意，我们就不能获得我们现在已经达成的结果。由于我们规定了一个结束的日期，同时由于柬埔寨代表团在最后时刻提出一些问题，因此有人批评柬埔寨把协定的签字拖迟了数小时。我愿意说明对于这次拖延我们并不负责，我们已经尽了我们的力量促进问题的解决。如果尽管我们努力仍然拖迟了几小时的话，那是因为我们必须向会议提出几个问题。当我们有某些保留时，我们已尽力做了一切来缩短拖迟的时间。
    当各国政府在这里对在印度支那三国内停战达成协议的时刻，我代表柬埔寨王国政府表示一个真诚的愿望：在我们协商和谈判中的谅解和和解精神，当实施协定时将继续表现。在我们协商一开始时，我们的问题就是困难的。而因为我们为了促成解决曾使用了耐心和谅解，我们成功了。因此，本会议最重要的任务已经解决了。和解的精神必须继续保持，而当实施和平时，这种精神将变成事实。因此，我的代表团愿意向每个人表示衷心的谢意，并说明柬埔寨王国政府将本着谅解与充分的容忍精神来实施协定。
    孟戴斯—弗朗斯发言。他在表示感谢瑞士当局和联合国的服务后说，法国代表团是本着两位主席所如此恰当地描述的精神来参加本会议的工作的。柏林会议给我们在这里所指定的任务，是一个艰难的任务，那就是恢复印度支那和平。现在我们完成了这一任务。完成任务之所以可能，是因为在整个谈判期间，每个人都表现了一种和解精神。而没有这种精神，任何协议都是不可能达成的。现在建立的和平，不是一个尽善尽美的和平。要达到尽善尽美的和平，还需要继续努力，这就是说要依靠我们大家。但它将每天获得加强，如果在这里所表现的和解精神能够得到维持和支持。如果像法国代表团所真诚而坚定希望的那样，和平的确得到加强的话，那么我们这一次和平努力的结果，就将远远超出印度支那的边界，就将引导世界走向幸福，走向被期待着的全世界人民的确需要的恢复元气。
    主席艾登在向大家表示感谢后，于五时二十分宣布日内瓦会议闭幕。
