Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, July 17th: The people of Wuhan are redoubling their efforts to persist in flood control efforts under the current sustained high water levels of the Yangtze River. At 2:00 PM on July 17th, the water level at the Wuhan Customs station of the Yangtze River rose again to 28.14 meters. On the night of July 13th, the water level at the Wuhan Customs station reached 28.16 meters, only 12 centimeters below the highest water level in previous years (the highest water level in 1931 was 28.28 meters). The water level began to recede on the 14th, and by the afternoon of the 15th, it had fallen to 28.02 meters. Starting on the 16th, due to the rising water from Dongting Lake and rainfall in the urban area, the water level rose again.

At the meeting on the evening of the 15th, the Wuhan Flood Control Headquarters initially summarized the flood control work of the previous stage and put forward future flood control tasks. The Headquarters emphasized that Wuhan is still under sustained high water levels. The current task is to persist in unremitting struggle, prevent any complacency or slackening, and prepare to meet the arrival of new flood peaks. The city's dike reinforcement and heightening project was basically completed on the 15th. The "benchmark height" (i.e., the height corresponding to the water level) of the main dikes has generally been raised to about 29.5 meters to 30 meters, and the dike surface has also been widened and thickened compared to the original. In the future, flood control engineering will focus on reinforcement, but attention should also be paid to heightening. The meeting also decided to conduct a thorough inspection of the city's dikes to overcome weaknesses and eliminate dangers, while also preparing wave protection equipment and all materials for flood control and rescue, to achieve strict defense and timely rescue. Furthermore, it is important to cherish and save materials on the premise of ensuring safety. The meeting decided to rectify the flood control team and further improve the efficiency of flood control work.

    武汉市人民继续坚持防汛斗争
    【新华社武汉十七日电】武汉市人民在长江当前持续的高水位下，再接再厉继续坚持防汛斗争。十七日下午二时，长江武汉关水位又已涨到二十八点一四公尺。十三日夜武汉关水位曾达到二十八点一六公尺，距历年最高水位（一九三一年最高水位二十八点二八公尺）仅差十二公分。十四日水位开始回落，到十五日下午曾落到二十八点零二公尺。十六日起因受洞庭湖方面涨水和市区附近降雨等影响，水位又有回升。
    武汉市防汛总指挥部在十五日晚间的会议上，初步总结了前一阶段的防汛工作，提出了今后的防汛任务。总指挥部强调指出：武汉市目前仍然处于持续的高水位下，当前的任务是坚持不懈的斗争，防止任何麻痹、松懈思想，准备迎接新的洪峰到来。全市的堤防培修加高工程已于十五日基本完工，主要堤防的“标高”（即与水位相应的高度）一般都加高到二十九点五公尺到三十公尺左右，堤面也大都比原来加宽培厚了。今后防汛工程转以加固为主，也要注意到加高。会议并决定对全市堤防普遍作一次认真检查，克服堤防弱点，消除险情，同时作好防浪设备和准备好防汛抢险应用的一切器材，作到严密防守，及时抢险；并且要在保证安全的前提下，爱惜与节省器材。会议决定整顿防汛队伍，进一步提高防汛工作效率。
