    The Tenth Anniversary of People's Poland
    Kiriłłok, Ambassador of the People's Republic of Poland to China
    July 22nd is a great festival for all the people of Poland: the tenth anniversary of the founding of People's Poland. On July 22, 1944, the Polish army fought side by side with the Soviet army and liberated the first piece of Polish land; it was on this land that the Polish Committee of National Liberation was established, and from then on, the people's power was born.

    In the history of the Polish nation, the working people—workers, peasants, and working intellectuals—for the first time took power into their own hands. This achievement of the Polish people came from the lessons of the past. Our history of the past two centuries especially clearly shows that no ruling class in the past could guarantee Poland's independence and development. In the 18th and 19th centuries, Poland's feudal rule caused Poland to lose its country and independence for about a century and a half. The victorious October Revolution overthrew the rule of the Tsar and also led to the collapse of the Prussian and Austrian Empires. Therefore, Poland also regained its independence.

    But after twenty-two years under the rule of landlords and capitalists, Poland lost its independence again. The landlords and capitalists adopted a policy of selling Poland's resources and independence to foreign capitalists, and a policy of imperialist war against the greatest friend of the Polish people—the Soviet Union. These policies brought about the demise of our country and the terrible five-year Hitlerian occupation.

    When Polish territory was liberated for the second time by the Soviet army's counter-offensive, our people would never allow the former ruling class to be restored; our people handed over power to the emerging class—the working class. The working class formed a fraternal alliance with the working peasants, leading the people to a new road, the road of socialist construction; the Soviet Union has set a brilliant example for us in socialist construction.

    Since then, our country's strength has begun to develop unprecedentedly.

    The People's Government implemented the great social reforms for which the Polish revolutionary martyrs had fought for hundreds of years; the landlords' land was confiscated and distributed to the working peasants; factories, mines, banks, and railways were nationalized, and the working people gained freedom and democratic rights; the broad masses of people enjoyed the benefits of science and culture.

    From then on, the strength of the Polish people has greatly developed. With the fraternal and selfless assistance of the Soviet Union and the selfless efforts of the entire Polish people, Poland successfully completed the economic recovery Three-Year Plan and began to implement the large-scale Six-Year Plan for developing the economy and laying the foundation for socialism in 1950. Now we have entered the fifth year of the Six-Year Plan; we can proudly say that Poland has completely changed its face. The Polish people have transformed a backward, weak country, a tool in the hands of foreign imperialists, into a modernized industrial-agricultural country, a country with universal culture and education, and an independent and prosperous country based on a great alliance of friendship with the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the people's democratic countries.

    The following figures illustrate the great achievements of the free Polish people in the past ten years in industry and agriculture, as well as in the development of culture and science. If the industrial output in 1938 is taken as 100, then 1946 was 73, and 1953 was 360; the industrial output in 1953 was 3.6 times the pre-war level, or 4.8 times per capita.

    From 1950 to 1953, the total agricultural output value increased by 10 percent; calculated per capita, the total agricultural output value in 1953 increased by 30 percent compared with pre-war. The actual income of each farmer increased by 20 percent between 1950 and 1953; compared with pre-war in 1953, it increased by 75 percent.

    In order to strengthen peaceful cooperation between countries, Poland's foreign trade volume has increased significantly.

    The following index shows the rapid increase in Poland's foreign trade volume (calculated at constant prices): 1937—100; 1949—155; 1953—192; 1954—202 (planned figures)

    Along with political and economic changes, Poland has also undergone great social and cultural changes in the past ten years, which can be seen from the achievements of the working people in labor law and social insurance, as well as in the development of education, science, reading, and literary creation. Let us take the development of higher education in the past ten years as an example: before the war, there were 27 institutions of higher learning with 48,000 students, all of whom were children of capitalists and landlords; now there are 85 institutions of higher learning, accommodating more than 130,000 children of workers, peasants, and working intellectuals.

    The publishing industry of People's Poland has greatly developed.

    If the number of books published in 1945 is taken as 100, then 1948 was 500, 1949 was 729, and 1950 was 1,225. In the twenty years of capitalist rule in Poland, a total of 400 million books were published; in the eight years that the people have been in power, 550 million books have been published, and this number is constantly and rapidly increasing.

    The living standards of the Polish people are improving day by day; Poland is bravely moving towards a bright future.

    The Polish people are building socialism with full confidence; they are convinced that the great peace camp will surely win. This camp is headed by the great Soviet Union; standing at the forefront of this camp is the largest country in Asia—People's China.

    The Polish people are watching the vigorous development of the great, liberated Chinese people with special love and sympathy. There are many similar events in the history of our two countries. Like the Chinese people, the Polish people will never succumb to the shackles of enslavement. In the last fifty years of the last century, there was the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom peasant revolution in China, and there was the January Uprising in 1863 in Poland. After the First World War, the proletarians of China and Poland fought under the common banner of Marxism-Leninism; the heroic revolutionary struggles of Shanghai workers and Beijing students had a strong resonance among the Polish people.

    The Polish people welcomed the victory of the Chinese revolution with extreme joy—this is one of the greatest events in world history after the victory of the great October Revolution and the crushing of Hitlerite fascism. The Polish people are watching the reconstruction and development of People's China with warm sympathy, as well as the tremendous efforts and achievements of the Chinese people in implementing the first Five-Year Plan.

    Now, unbreakable common ideals and goals, as well as ardent friendship, connect the Polish people and the Chinese people together. Economic and cultural agreements between China and Poland, visits and performances by cultural troupes, mutual visits between the people of the two countries, and mutual holding of exhibitions... all of these have consolidated the ties between our two countries, contributed to the construction undertakings of both countries, and strengthened our friendship in the struggle for peace.

    In the land of the heroic Korean people, the Polish representatives in the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission have been fighting to stop the adventurous policies of US imperialism. The Polish people are watching the efforts of Zhou Enlai, the representative of the People's Republic of China, and Molotov, the representative of the Soviet Union, to strive for peace at the Geneva Conference with sympathy and admiration.

    On the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the founding of People's Poland, the Polish people are proud to see their achievements and have confidence in victory; because this is the road the Soviet Union has taken, and this is the road that the People's Republic of China and the people's democratic countries are taking.

    The friendship between the people of Poland and China will become closer; both countries will become increasingly prosperous and strong, and the great camp of peace and socialism will become stronger day by day. The strength of the camp of peace and socialism will surely be able to stop the war forces of imperialism.

    人民波兰的十年
    波兰人民共和国驻华大使　基里洛克
    七月二十二日是全波兰人民的一个伟大的节日：人民波兰建国十周年。一九四四年七月二十二日，波兰军队与苏联军队并肩作战，解放了波兰的第一片土地；就在这片土地上成立了波兰民族解放委员会，从此人民政权诞生了。
    在波兰民族的历史上，劳动人民——工人、农民与劳动知识分子第一次把政权掌握在自己的手中。波兰人民的这一成就，是由过去的经验教训中得来的。我们近两个世纪的历史尤其清楚地说明，过去任何一个统治阶级都不能保证波兰的独立与发展。十八世纪与十九世纪时，波兰的封建统治使波兰在约一个半世纪中丧失了国家和独立。胜利的十月革命推翻了沙皇的统治，也使普鲁士与奥地利帝国走向崩溃。因此波兰也恢复了独立。
    但在地主与资本家统治的二十二年后，波兰又丧失了独立。地主与资本家采取了把波兰的资源与独立出卖给外国大资本家的政策，采取了反对波兰人民的最伟大的朋友——苏联——的帝国主义战争政策。这些政策带来了我们国家的灭亡，带来了为时五年的可怕的希特勒占领。
    当波兰的国土因苏联军队反攻而获得第二次解放以后，我们的人民就绝不允许再让过去统治阶级复辟；我们的人民把政权交给了新兴的阶级——工人阶级。工人阶级与劳动农民结成了兄弟同盟，领导人民走向新的道路，走向社会主义建设的道路；苏联已在社会主义建设方面给我们树立了光辉的榜样。
    自从那时起，我们国家的力量开始了空前巨大的发展。
    人民政府实行了波兰革命先烈几百年来为之斗争的、伟大的社会改革；地主的土地被没收而分给劳动农民；厂矿、银行与铁路收归国有，劳动人民得到了自由与民主的权利；广大人民享受到科学与文化的利益。
    从此波兰人民的力量有了巨大的发展。在苏联的兄弟般无私的帮助与波兰全体人民的忘我努力下，波兰胜利地完成了经济复兴三年计划，并在一九五零年起开始执行为发展经济与奠定社会主义基础的大规模的六年计划。现在我们已迈入六年计划的第五年；我们可以骄傲地说，波兰已完全改变了它的面貌。波兰人民已把一个落后的、衰弱的、外国帝国主义者手中的工具的国家，变成了一个近代化工业——农业国，变成了一个文化与教育普及的国家，变成了一个奠基在与苏联、中华人民共和国及各人民民主国家结成伟大的同盟友好之上的、独立富强的国家。
    下面的数字说明了自由的波兰人民十年来在工业与农业以及在发展文化与科学方面的巨大成就。如以一九三八年的工业产量为一○○，一九四六年为七三，一九五三年为三六○；一九五三年的工业产量计为战前水平的三点六倍，如按人口计算，则为四点八倍。
    从一九五零年到一九五三年，农业总产值增加了百分之十；如按人口计算，一九五三年农业总产值比战前增加了百分之三十。每一农民的实际收入，在一九五零年至一九五三年期间增加了百分之二十；若以一九五三年与战前相比，则增加了百分之七十五。
    为了加强各国之间的和平合作，波兰的对外贸易额有了显著的增加。
    下面的指数说明波兰对外贸易额（以不变价格计算）的迅速增加情形：一九三七年—一○○；一九四九年—一五五；一九五三年—一九二；一九五四年—二○二（计划数字）
    随着政治与经济的改变，波兰十年来在社会与文化方面也有了很大的变化，这可以由劳动人民在劳动法与社会保险方面的成就以及在教育、科学、阅读与文艺创作等方面的发展看出来。让我们举例说明十年来高等教育的发展情形：战前有高等学校二十七所，有学生四万八千人，这些学生都是资本家与地主的子女；现在有高等学校八十五所，容纳了工人、农民与劳动知识分子的子女十三万多人。
    人民波兰的出版事业有了很大的发展。
    如以一九四五年的书籍出版数量为一○○，则一九四八年为五○○，一九四九年为七二九，一九五零年为一、二二五。资本主义统治波兰的二十年里，共出版了书籍四亿册；人民掌握政权的八年里，即出版书籍五亿五千万册，而且这一数字在不断地迅速增加。
    波兰人民的生活水平正在一天天提高；波兰正勇敢地走向光明的未来。
    波兰人民正在满怀信心地建设着社会主义；他们深信伟大的和平阵营一定获得胜利。这一个阵营是以伟大的苏联为首的；站在这一个阵营的前列的是亚洲最大的一个国家——人民中国。
    波兰人民怀着特殊热爱与同情的心情，注视着伟大的、解放了的中国人民的蓬勃发展。我们两国的历史上有许多相同的事迹。波兰人民也和中国人民一样，永远不屈服于奴役的束缚。上一个世纪的后五十年里，在中国有太平天国的农民革命，在波兰有一八六三年的一月起义。在第一次世界大战以后，中国与波兰的无产者，在共同的马克思—列宁主义的旗帜下斗争；上海工人与北京学生的英勇革命斗争，在波兰人民中间有强烈的反响。
    波兰人民以极为欢悦的心情欢迎中国革命的胜利—这是世界历史上在伟大的十月革命胜利之后与粉碎希特勒法西斯主义之后的一个最伟大的事件。波兰人民怀着热烈的同情心注视着人民中国的重建和发展以及中国人民在执行第一个五年计划中的巨大努力与成就。
    现在，牢不可破的共同理想与目的以及热情的友谊把波兰人民与中国人民联结在一起。中波之间的经济与文化协定、文工团的访问演出、两国人民之间的互相访问、展览会的交互举办……这一切都巩固了我们两国间的联系，都有助于两国的建设事业，都加强了我们为和平事业而斗争的友谊。
    在英雄的朝鲜人民的土地上，中立国遣返委员会与中立国监察委员会中的波兰代表一直是在为阻止美帝国主义的冒险政策而斗争。波兰人民以同情与钦佩的心情注视着中华人民共和国代表周恩来与苏联代表莫洛托夫共同在日内瓦会议上争取和平的努力。
    在人民波兰建国十周年之际，波兰人民骄傲地看到自己的成就，并对胜利怀着信心；因为这是苏联走过的道路，这是中华人民共和国和各人民民主国家所走的道路。
    波中两国人民之间的友谊将更加紧密；两国将日益繁荣富强，伟大的和平与社会主义阵营将一天比一天壮大。和平与社会主义阵营的力量一定能阻止住帝国主义的战争势力。
