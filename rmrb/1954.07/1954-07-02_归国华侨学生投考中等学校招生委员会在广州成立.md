    The Overseas Chinese Students Applying for Secondary Schools Admissions Committee Established in Guangzhou
    In order to better assist overseas Chinese students in enrolling in schools, the Ministry of Higher Education of the Central People's Government, the Ministry of Education, and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission have decided to move the "Beijing Overseas Chinese Students Applying for Secondary Schools Admissions Committee" established last year to Guangzhou, and merge it with the "Guangzhou Overseas Chinese Students Applying for Secondary Schools Admissions Committee" into the "Overseas Chinese Students Applying for Secondary Schools Admissions Committee," which will be responsible for handling the enrollment matters of overseas Chinese students returning to China this summer. The committee has now begun working in Guangzhou. Except for the students of the two overseas Chinese students' secondary preparatory schools in Beijing and Jimei, who will participate in the unified entrance examination in Beijing and Xiamen, Fujian, newly returned students and students originally in the Guangzhou Overseas Chinese Students' Secondary Preparatory School will participate in the unified entrance examination for overseas Chinese students applying for secondary schools held by the committee in Guangzhou in two phases in July and August. Students who fail to be admitted through the examination will also be placed in appropriate classes in the three overseas Chinese students' secondary preparatory schools in Guangzhou, Beijing, and Jimei for study, according to their examination scores. The committee will assist overseas Chinese students graduating from high school and returning to China to Guangzhou to apply for universities by handling their application procedures and assisting them in participating in the unified entrance examination for the Guangzhou examination area of universities.
    The committee also has a brochure on the admission of overseas Chinese students applying for secondary schools, which is available upon request.

    归国华侨学生投考中等学校招生委员会在广州成立
    为了更好地帮助归国华侨学生入学，中央人民政府高等教育部、教育部和华侨事务委员会决定将去年设立的“北京归国华侨学生投考中等学校招生委员会”迁至广州市，和“广州归国华侨学生投考中等学校招生委员会”合并为“归国华侨学生投考中等学校招生委员会”，负责办理今年暑期归国华侨学生的入学事宜。该会现已开始在广州市办公。除现在北京、集美两个归国华侨学生中等补习学校的学生，将在北京和福建厦门参加统一招生考试外，新近回国及原在广州归国华侨学生中等补习学校的学生，都将于七、八两月份分期在广州参加该会举办的华侨学生投考中等学校的统一招生考试。考试未能录取的学生，亦将按照考试成绩分别安置在广州、北京、集美三个归国华侨学生中等补习学校的相当班级进行学习。高中毕业、回国到广州投考高等学校的华侨学生，该会将代为办理报考手续，协助其参加高等学校广州考区的统一招生考试。
    该会另备有归国华侨学生投考中等学校招生简章，可供索取。
