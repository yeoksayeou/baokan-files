Wuhan's state-owned commercial departments and cooperatives have organized service teams to promptly supply daily necessities such as rice, oil, salt, towels, and toothbrushes to various flood control construction sites, supporting the flood-fighting army in overcoming the floods. In addition to the existing cooperatives and state-owned stores near the dikes already strengthening their supply efforts, the city's department stores, timber companies, cooperative systems, and others have transferred over one hundred additional staff members to go deep into the flood control construction sites to supply goods.

Some units have established fixed supply stations at the flood control construction sites. The Wuhan City Cooperative General Society's vegetable supply and marketing stations in Daijiashan and Gushushu supply over 10,000 jin of vegetables daily to flood control personnel on the Zhanggong Dike. The number of mobile supply teams using flatbed carts, tricycles, and barges to deliver goods to various construction sites is increasing daily. Mobile service teams from the Huiji and Jianghan District Cooperatives and department stores have delivered large quantities of bread, salted duck eggs, sausages, and cigarettes to the flood control construction sites, warmly welcomed by the flood control personnel. The three branches of the Wuchang District Cooperative originally located in the Wuqing Dike and Baishazhou area are also supplying goods to the flood control construction sites at night.

    武汉市国营商业部门和合作社
    组织服务大队加强防汛工地物资供应工作
    武汉市国营商业部门和合作社组织服务大队，把大米、油、盐、毛巾、牙刷等生活用品及时供应给各防汛工地，支援防汛大军战胜洪水。现在，除原有的靠近堤防的合作社和国营商店已经加强供应工作外，该市百货公司、木材公司、合作社等系统已另抽调一百多名工作人员，深入防汛工地供应货物。
    有些单位在防汛工地上设立了固定供应站。武汉市合作总社在戴家山和姑嫂树设立的蔬菜供销站，每天供应张公堤上防汛人员的菜蔬，达一万多斤。在各个工地上，利用板车、三轮货车和驳船送货的流动供应队一天天增多。惠济和江汉等区合作社和百货公司的流动服务队已把大批面包、咸蛋、香肠和香烟等送到防汛工地，受到防汛人员热烈欢迎。武昌区合作社原来设在武庆堤和白沙洲一带的三个分社夜间也对防汛工地供应货物。
