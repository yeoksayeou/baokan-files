    Longyan Special District in Fujian Province is actively promoting the local experience of utilizing idle fields after the harvest of single-season early rice to plant late-season peanuts, further tapping the land's production potential and increasing oil crop production. Recently, the Longyan Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has notified all counties to do a good job in supplying seeds and providing technical guidance in order to complete the scheduled planting task before the Beginning of Autumn (立秋); and agricultural technology training classes have been opened in the two key promotion areas of Dachi and Fucheng in Longyan County to impart the techniques of planting late-season peanuts.

    In the western part of Fujian province, there are many pieces of land that have traditionally been abandoned after the harvest of early rice. In recent years, some farmers in Longyan, Zhangping, WuPing and other counties have experimented with planting late-season peanuts in such idle fields and have achieved good harvests. Late-season peanuts are less affected by the rainy season, and their yield is more stable than that of early-season peanuts, generally reaching 150 to 200 catties per mu. Planting late-season peanuts can also regulate soil fertility and improve the soil. Therefore, winter rapeseed and the following year's rice grow better than in general land. According to statistics, the Longyan Special District has 200,000 mu of single-season early rice fields that are left idle after the early rice harvest. At least 50,000 mu of these are suitable for planting late-season peanuts. If these can be gradually utilized, the annual peanut production can be increased by at least 7.5 million catties.

    龙岩专区推广利用休闲地种晚花生的经验
    福建省龙岩专区正积极推广当地利用单季早稻收割后的休闲田种植晚花生的经验，进一步发挥土地生产潜力和增产油料作物。最近，中共龙岩地委已通知各县做好种籽供应和技术指导工作，以便在立秋前完成预定播种任务；并在龙岩县大池、附城两重点推广区开办农业技术训练班，传授种植晚花生的技术。
    在福建西部地区有很多土地历来在早稻收割之后即弃置不用，最近几年来，龙岩、漳平、武平等县某些农民利用这样的休闲田试种晚花生，收获良好。晚花生因不受雨季影响，产量较早花生还要稳定，一般每亩可达一百五十斤到二百斤。种晚花生并能调节地力和改良土壤，因此，冬种油菜和次年种植水稻，生长情况也比一般土地为好。据统计，龙岩专区有二十万亩单季早稻田，在早稻收割后即将休闲，其中适合种植晚花生的至少有五万亩，如能逐步加以利用，每年至少可增产花生七百五十万斤以上。
