    【新华社郑州三日电】新建的国营郑州第一棉纺织厂在七月一日结束试车，转入正式生产。这一天，工厂里里外外都洋溢着喜气，几百面彩旗迎风招展。上午九时正，中央人民政府纺织工业部基本建设局副局长陈钧在主厂房门口剪断了彩绸，鞭炮声、欢呼声和上工的汽笛声响成一片，全厂的机器一齐开动起来。从此，这个工厂就要每月出产能做几十万套衣服的白细布，源源供应当地人民的需要。
    七月一日早晨，全厂职工曾在主厂房前面的工厂花园里举行了开工生产典礼。参加典礼的，还有建筑这个工厂的中南纺织管理局工程公司的职工代表和为这个厂安装机器的中央人民政府纺织工业部安装公司郑州大队的全体职工。郑州市郊区农民和河南省洛阳、商邱、新乡、安阳等产棉区的农民也推派代表赶来参加大会。在开工典礼大会上，郑州第一棉纺织厂厂长李之放报告了这个厂在试车期间已经取得的良好的生产成就。他说：到六月底，棉纱产量继续巩固在每千个锭子每小时二十六点五公斤以上的水平，纱的质量全部达到甲等；布的产量每台布机每小时四点一码多，正布率达到百分之九十五以上。中共河南省委员会工业部部长吴皓、郑州市人民政府市长宋致和等都在会上讲了话，他们一致向郑州第一棉纺织厂全体职工和这个工厂的建设者致热烈的祝贺，向支援工厂建设和生产的农民表示衷心的感谢。农民代表也在会上讲了话，表示要多生产棉花、粮食、肉类、蔬菜等来支援工厂的生产。工人和农民代表还互相赠送礼物：工人送给农民布和纱；农民送给工人棉花、蔬菜和他们自己编织的草帽等土产特产品。最后，大会在高涨的热情中通过了给毛主席的致敬电。
