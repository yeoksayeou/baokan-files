To prevent cotton from growing excessively and maturing late, increase cotton production and quality.
Central Ministry of Agriculture, General Bureau of Agricultural Production

Late-stage excessive growth and late maturity of cotton have a significant impact on both yield and quality. In terms of yield, excessive growth in the later stages means that some cotton bolls do not have time to mature and open. Even the cotton bolls that can still open after frost suffer a certain loss in yield, with boll weight often reduced by about 50%. In terms of cotton quality, cotton that opens after frost matures late, and the fibers are not good; substandard frost-damaged cotton cannot be used in textiles at all.

This year, many cotton-growing areas have experienced excessive rainfall and low temperatures, delaying the sowing or emergence period of cotton. Pests and diseases generally occurred earlier and more severely than in previous years; many cotton fields could not be thinned and weeded in time due to flooding, resulting in weed infestation. As a result, cotton seedlings are currently growing poorly, developing slowly, and the tendency towards late maturity is bound to be more serious than in previous years; especially in cotton fields with heavier and more fertile soil, after entering the hot season, with frequent hot and autumn rains, it is easier to grow excessively and mature late. Therefore, overcoming excessive growth and late maturity of cotton has become an important link in completing this year's cotton production increase plan.

In recent years, labor models and scientific research workers in various regions have accumulated considerable experience and research on overcoming excessive growth and late maturity of cotton. The results show that as long as there are correct technical measures and strengthened field management, it is possible to prevent excessive growth and late maturity of cotton. The main technical measures for preventing excessive growth and promoting early maturity of cotton are as follows, and various regions can flexibly apply them with reference to the specific growth conditions of cotton this year.

I. Rush to Weed, Cultivate Diligently, and Earth Up
For cotton fields with weed infestation due to excessive rain and soil moisture, the most important measure at present should be to rush to weed and cultivate diligently. After rain or during continuous rain, as long as it is possible to go to the field, weeding and cultivating should be rushed, and the depth of cultivation should be appropriately increased. This can directly relieve weed infestation, and frequent and deep cultivation can accelerate the restoration of excessively moist soil to a normal state, increase the circulation of air in the soil, and increase soil temperature, so that cotton plants can grow and develop rapidly.

Earthing up in conjunction with cultivation is particularly important in southern cotton-growing areas with more rainfall. This can increase the exposure of sunlight to the soil surface, increase soil temperature, and facilitate cotton field drainage, avoiding water accumulation after rain, which is very important for preventing late maturity. According to the experimental results of Xiaoshan Cotton Farm in Zhejiang Province, earthing up increased production by about 12% compared to not earthing up.

II. Topdressing Should Not Be Applied Late, Irrigation Should Be Timely and Appropriate
Whether cotton fields can grow and develop normally mainly depends on whether the supply of water and nutrients in each growth stage of cotton is appropriate. At present, the phenomenon of fertilizer deficiency in cotton fields is still quite common, especially in cotton fields that have suffered from flooding this year, where the little fertilizer that was applied has also been washed away by rain. Many cotton fields still have very thin and short cotton seedlings, and it is very important to seize the time to add some quick-acting topdressing to promote growth and development. For dryland cotton fields and wheat stubble cotton fields with serious fertilizer deficiency, it is best to apply some liquid manure as topdressing, which will have a faster effect; it is even better to apply some quick-acting phosphate fertilizer. However, it must be noted that if topdressing is applied late, it will cause excessive growth in the later stages of cotton, delay maturity, and be harmful rather than beneficial. In 1951, Zhujiazhuang in Cixian County, Hebei Province, applied 10 to 30 catties of ammonium sulfate per mu as topdressing in cotton fields as late as early August. Coupled with more rainfall in August, the late-stage growth was too vigorous, and by mid-November, two-thirds of the cotton bolls could not open. Some households did not even harvest any seed cotton.

At present, on the one hand, it is necessary to promote the rapid recovery of cotton plants, and on the other hand, it is necessary to prevent excessive growth caused by inappropriate supply of nutrients and water, resulting in excessive fertilizer strength and water in the later stages of growth. In addition to controlling fertilizer application, it is necessary to pay attention to drainage and flood prevention in cotton fields during the rainy season. Irrigation of cotton fields should adhere to the principle of timely and appropriate amount according to the growth needs of cotton plants, soil moisture, rainfall, etc., and implement shallow irrigation and ditch irrigation, paying attention to avoiding the overlap of irrigation and rainfall. Especially in cotton fields with high water levels, sticky soil, and late cotton growth, irrigation should be stopped early; if it rains after irrigation, deep cultivation and sun-drying should be used to remedy the situation.

III. Pay Attention to the Prevention and Control of Cotton Pests, Especially Pests During the Bud and Boll Stage
This year, the occurrence of pests during the emergence period of cotton seedlings was earlier and more common than in previous years, and pests during the bud and boll stage have also appeared. Pests during the bud and boll stage can cause a large number of buds and bolls to fall off, as well as excessive growth and late maturity of cotton. They are also the main cause of stiff petals and rotten bolls. According to the inspection of Jiujiang Special Zone Farm in Jiangxi Province in 1953, a large number of cotton buds and bolls fell off before July 15, of which 84% were caused by pests. In 1952, He Zhuang and Wang Guanying villages in Huojia, Henan Province, used "666" to control mirid bugs in 253 mu, and the cotton fields that were controlled produced more than 43 catties per mu compared to those that were not controlled. This year, there is more rainfall and the cotton fields are humid, and the spread of pests during the bud and boll stage is likely to be aggravated. Serious attention must be paid and timely prevention and control must be carried out. It is best to continuously spray with broad-spectrum pesticides from late July to mid-September, such as 50% wettable DDT, 25% DDT emulsion, 10% DDT powder, or 10% DDT sulfur powder, etc., once every 15 days; if "666" pesticide is used, spray once every 7 days. If the supply of pesticides is insufficient, artificial capture can also be used for control.

Doing a good job in pest control is very significant in promoting early maturity of cotton. For example, in 1953, Jizhuang Village in Anyang, Henan Province, planted 514 mu of cotton. Because the pest control work was done well, the flowers were generally harvested twice in early October, while in the neighboring Zhuchangtun Village, the pest control was poor, there were few early peaches, and most cotton fields had not yet begun to harvest flowers in early October.

IV. Timely and Correct Pruning
Correct pruning is the main measure to reduce bud and boll shedding, prevent excessive growth, and promote early maturity. According to the experimental report of Dingxian Special Zone Farm in Hebei Province in 1953, under the same density and management conditions, the boll shedding rate of pruned cotton was 17.7% less than that of unpruned cotton. The pruning experiment of Jingzhou Farm in Hubei Province in 1953 showed that the yield of pruned cotton was 21.8% higher than that of unpruned cotton, and the amount of frost-damaged and rotten flowers was 30.2% less.

Pruning work must be carried out appropriately according to the specific conditions of weather, soil fertility, and cotton plant development. It must not be thought that because the cotton growth period is delayed this year, the pruning work can also be delayed; on the contrary, precisely because the early development of cotton plants is slow, appropriate pruning methods should be used to reverse the natural trend of delayed maturity. At present, the most important thing is to correctly implement topping and pinching, and to frequently remove superfluous buds on the main stem and fruit branches.

Topping is to remove the growing point on the main stem of cotton plants after they have grown a certain number of fruit branches, limiting the continued upward growth of cotton plants, so as to concentrate nutrients for the development of lower buds and bolls. The topping period is generally from the beginning of the hot season to before the beginning of autumn. In the case of delayed early development this year, appropriately reducing the number of fruit branches and topping early is even more important to avoid late maturity.

Pinching is to remove the growing point of the fruit branches after they have grown to a certain extent, limiting the continued elongation of the fruit branches, avoiding the ineffective buds and bolls that consume nutrients, and concentrating the nutrients to supply the retained buds and bolls. Generally, the standard is to retain four to five nodes for the middle fruit branches and two to three fruit nodes for the lower and upper fruit branches, and to carry out the pinching in stages according to the growth of the cotton plants. If the cotton plants are developing slowly this year, the number of fruit nodes retained for pinching should also be appropriately reduced. In cotton fields with sufficient water and nutrients, doing a good job in pinching is very effective in achieving early maturity and high yield of cotton plants. According to the large-field pruning observation of Dingxian Special Zone Farm in 1953, in cotton fields with the same management, the bud shedding rate of topped but not pinched cotton was 26%, and the boll shedding rate was 64%; the bud shedding rate of topped and pinched cotton was 10%, and the boll shedding rate was 57%. The early flowering of pinched cotton also increased. According to the statistics on November 12, the lint yield of pinched cotton reached 81%, while that of unpinched cotton was only 75%. In addition, the average weight per 100 bolls of pinched cotton increased by about 2 taels compared to unpinched cotton.

When pruning work needs to be carried out, if there is continuous rain, efforts should be made to overcome difficulties and avoid delays. As long as it is possible to enter the field, pruning should continue in the rain. The high-yielding cotton fields of Zhoujiazhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jin County, Hebei Province, achieved a bumper harvest of 400 catties per mu in 1953, which was closely related to their seizing the opportunity to prune during the rainy season.

Cotton pests lay eggs on the tender heads and tips of cotton plants. When pruning and branching, the picked branches and leaves should be carried out of the field to prevent the spread of pests. These tender branches and leaves can also be used to compost a lot of green manure to increase fertilizer sources.

After August and September, if the branches and leaves of cotton are too luxuriant, "empty branches" (cutting off empty fruit branches with completely detached buds and bolls) and "old leaves" (picking off some of the old leaves in the middle and lower parts of the cotton after it begins to shed lint) can be appropriately carried out. These measures can help promote early maturity. According to the inspection of Zhoujiazhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jin County, Hebei Province on October 12, 1953, 71% of the cotton with empty branches cut had shed lint, while only 60% of the cotton without empty branches cut had shed lint.

V. Implement Late-Stage Deep Cultivation and Sun-Drying
According to the experience of cotton farmers in many areas, implementing late-stage deep cultivation and sun-drying is a good way to overcome excessive growth and promote early maturity in the case of heavy autumn rains. The effect is particularly significant on cotton fields that are generally referred to as "cold land" and "old seedlings do not develop but small seedlings do not develop." The method is to use a hoe to cultivate as deeply as possible to a depth of three or four inches between the cotton rows in autumn. This can cut off some of the lateral roots and fibrous roots of the cotton, increase the circulation of air in the soil, increase soil temperature, reduce cotton field humidity, promote cotton maturity, and reduce the phenomenon of cotton boll mildew. In 1953, some people in Xiuwen Village in Yuci, Shanxi Province, were still cultivating and sun-drying cotton fields as late as early October; later inspections showed that when 56% of the cotton in general fields had shed lint, more than 70% of the cotton fields that were cultivated and sun-dried had shed lint.

In addition, if cotton grows too vigorously and it is difficult to enter the cotton field for cultivation and sun-drying, the method of "pushing the plants and combining the ridges" can be appropriately adopted - every other ridge, use both hands to push the cotton rows to the left and right, and at the same time, gently step on the lower part of the cotton plants with your feet, so that the cotton plants are slightly inclined to both sides, and then cultivate and sun-dry between the ridges.

    不让棉花徒长晚熟，提高棉花产量和质量
    中央农业部农业生产总局
    棉花的后期徒长和晚熟，对产量和品质都有很大影响。从产量方面来说，由于后期徒长，有一部分棉铃来不及成熟吐絮。即使霜后仍能吐絮的棉铃，产量上也有一定的损失，铃重往往要减少百分之五十左右。从棉花品质方面来说，霜后开的棉花，成熟的晚，纤维就不好了；次中级以下的霜黄花，在纺织上根本不能使用。
    今年许多棉区雨水多，气温低，棉花播种或出苗期延迟，棉田病虫害一般较往年发生得早而严重；许多棉田因雨涝不能及时间苗除草，发生草荒。因此，目前棉苗生长不良，发育迟缓，晚熟的趋向势必比往年更严重；特别在土壤粘性较重和比较肥沃的棉田，入伏后气温增高，在伏雨、秋雨很多的季节，更易徒长和晚熟。因此，克服棉花的徒长和晚熟，已成为完成今年棉花增产计划的重要环节。
    几年来，各地劳动模范和科学研究工作者对克服棉花的徒长和晚熟，已有不少的经验和研究，结果说明只要有正确的技术措施，加强田间管理工作，防止棉花的徒长和晚熟，是可以做到的。防止棉株徒长和促进早熟的主要技术措施有以下几项，各地可参照当地今年棉花生长的具体情况灵活运用。
    一、抢锄草，勤中耕，进行培土
    因多雨土湿而发生草荒现象的棉田，目前最重要的措施应当是抢锄草、勤中耕。雨后或连雨期间，只要能下地即应赶紧抢行中耕除草，并适当加深中耕深度。这样，既可以直接解除草荒，同时因勤中耕、深中耕可使含水太多的土壤加速恢复正常状态，增加土壤中空气的流通量，提高土温，使棉株迅速生长发育。
    结合中耕进行培土，在南方棉区雨水较多的情况下，特别重要。这样既能增加阳光对土壤的照射面，提高地温，又有利于棉田排水，避免雨后积水，对于防止晚熟关系很大。浙江省萧山棉场试验结果，培土的比不培土的约增产百分之十二。
      二、追肥不能晚施，灌溉要适时适量
    棉田能不能正常地生长发育，主要取决于棉花各生育阶段水分、养分的供应是否适当。目前棉田缺肥现象还相当普遍，尤其今年遭受水涝的棉田，因雨水冲刷，仅有的肥料亦流失很多。许多棉田棉苗还长得很瘦弱矮小，抓紧时间增加一些速效追肥，促进生长发育是很重要的。缺肥严重的旱地棉田和麦茬棉田，最好施用一些水粪作追肥，起的效用更快些；能配施一部分速效磷肥更好。但必须注意的是，如果施用追肥晚了，便会使棉花后期徒长，延迟成熟，反而有害无益。一九五一年河北省磁县朱家庄迟至八月初在棉田每亩施用十至三十斤硫酸錏作追肥，碰上八月雨水又较多，致后期生长过旺，到十一月中旬时尚有三分之二的棉铃不能开絮，个别户甚至一点籽棉也没有收到。
    目前一方面要促使棉株迅速恢复生长，同时又要防止因养分、水分供应不适当，致使生长后期肥劲太大，水分太多，引起徒长。除控制肥料施用外，在雨水多的季节，必须经常注意作好棉田排水防涝工作。灌溉棉田要根据棉株生育需要、土壤湿度、下雨情况等，掌握适时适量原则，实行浅灌沟灌，注意避免灌溉与雨水的重复。尤其水位高，土壤粘，棉花生育较晚的棉田，停灌要早；如果灌溉后遇雨，要即采用深中耕、晒地的办法来补救。
      三、注意防治棉虫，特别是蕾铃期害虫
    今年棉花出苗的时期虫害较往年发生的早而普遍，目前蕾铃期害虫也已出现。蕾铃期虫害会使棉花大量脱落蕾铃和徒长晚熟，同时也是形成僵瓣烂铃的主要原因。江西九江专区农场一九五三年检查，七月十五日以前棉花蕾铃大量脱落，其中因虫害而脱落的占百分之八十四。一九五二年河南获嘉贺庄及王官营两村利用“六六六”防治盲椿象二五三亩，防治的棉田较没有防治的每亩增产四十三斤多。今年雨水较多，棉田阴湿，蕾铃期害虫的蔓延很可能更要加重，必须严重注意，及时进行防治。最好自七月下旬起至九月中旬止用兼治药剂连续喷治，如用百分之五十可湿性滴滴涕、百分之二十五滴滴涕乳剂、百分之十滴滴涕粉剂或百分之十滴滴涕硫磺粉等药剂，每隔十五天喷治一次；如用“六六六”药剂则每隔七天喷治一次。如药剂供应不足，亦可采用人工捕捉的方法，进行除治。
    做好治虫工作，对促进棉花早熟的作用是非常显著的。如河南安阳吉庄村一九五三年种棉花五一四亩，因治虫工作做得好，十月初已普遍收花两次，而邻村朱厂屯，治虫较差，早桃少，在十月初多数棉田尚未开始收花。
    四、及时地正确地进行整枝
    正确地整枝，是减少蕾铃脱落，防止徒长、促进早熟的主要措施。河北省定县专区农场一九五三年试验报告，同样密度和管理情况下，整枝者较不整枝者落铃率少百分之十七点七。湖北省荆州农场一九五三年整枝试验，整枝比不整枝的产量高百分之二十一点八，霜黄僵烂花少百分之三十点二。
    整枝工作必须根据天时、地力及棉株发育的具体情况，适当地进行。决不能认为今年棉花生育期延缓，整枝工作也可以延缓；相反的，正因为棉株早期发育迟缓，就应当用适当整枝的办法，来扭转延缓成熟的自然趋势。目前最主要的是正确实施摘心和打群尖的工作，并经常地除去主干上、果枝上的赘芽。
    摘心就是打顶尖，就是当棉株长出一定的果枝数后，摘去棉花主干上的生长点，限制棉株继续向上生长，以集中养分供下部蕾铃发育之用。摘心时期一般是从入伏到立秋前。在今年早期发育迟缓的情况下，适当少留果枝，及早进行摘心，对避免晚熟更加重要。
    打群尖，就是当果枝长到一定程度后，摘去果枝的生长点，限制果枝继续伸长，避免生长耗费养分的无效蕾铃，使养分集中供应到所保留的蕾铃上去。一般以中部果枝留四至五节、下部和上部果枝留二至三个果节为标准，按棉株生长情况分期进行。今年棉株发育得迟缓的，打群尖所留果节数也要适当减少。在水分、养分较充足的棉田，做好打群尖的工作，对争取棉株早熟丰产效果是很显著的。根据定县专区农场一九五三年大田整枝观察，同样管理的棉田，摘心而未打群尖的落蕾率百分之二十六，落铃率百分之六十四；摘心并进行打群尖的落蕾率百分之十，落铃率百分之五十七。打群尖的早期收花也增加了，据十一月十二日统计，打群尖的吐絮已达百分之八十一，未打群尖的尚只百分之七十五。另外，打群尖的较未打群尖的每百铃重平均增加了大约二两。
    当需要进行整枝工作的时候，如果遇上连阴雨，要尽量克服困难，避免拖延。只要可能进入地里，在雨中也应继续进行整枝。一九五三年河北晋县周家庄农业生产合作社的丰产棉田获得了每亩四百斤的丰收，和他们在雨期抓紧整枝有密切关系。
    棉虫多产卵在棉株嫩头和尖端，在整枝打杈时，应把摘下的枝叶携出地外，以免虫害蔓延。还可用这些嫩枝叶沤制许多绿肥，增加肥源。
    八、九月以后，如果棉花枝叶太繁茂，可适当进行“剪空枝”（把蕾铃完全脱落的空果枝剪去）和“打老叶”（在棉花开始吐絮后，将中、下部的老叶摘去一部分）。这些措施都能有助于促进早熟。据河北省晋县周家庄农业生产合作社一九五三年十月十二日检查，剪空枝的棉花已有百分之七十一吐絮，而未剪空枝的尚只有百分之六十吐絮。
    五、实行后期深锄、晒地
    根据许多地区棉农的经验，实行后期深锄、晒地，是在秋季多雨的情况下，克服徒长、促进早熟的好办法。特别是对一般所称的“冷地”及“发老苗不发小苗”的棉田，效果更显著。方法是秋季用锄在棉行间尽力深锄至三、四寸深，这样可截断棉花的一部分侧根和须根，增加土壤中空气的流通，提高土温，降低棉田湿度，促进棉花的成熟，并可减少棉铃霉烂的现象。一九五三年山西榆次修文村部分群众迟至十月初仍在棉田进行锄地、晒地；后来检查，当一般地棉花百分之五十六吐絮时，实行锄地、晒地的棉田，已有百分之七十多棉桃吐絮。
    另外，如果棉花生长过旺，进入棉田锄地、晒地有困难时，可适当采取“推株并垅”的办法——每隔一垅用两手将棉行向左右推开，同时用脚轻踩棉株下部，使棉株微向两侧倾斜，然后在垅间进行锄地、晒地。
