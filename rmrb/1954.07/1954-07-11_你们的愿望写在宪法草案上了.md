To the Soldier:

    Your Wishes Are Written in the Draft Constitution
    Zhao Zhongxin

Dear Border Soldier Comrade Yuan Yingzhong:

    We parted on May 10th on the Kawa Mountain in Yunnan border region, and on June 14th I returned to the heart of the motherland—Beijing.

    The day after I came back, it happened to be a joyous day. On this day, the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China was published. With excitement, I read the entire text of the Draft Constitution. The entire Draft Constitution is filled with the spirit of national equality, with a special section stipulating national regional autonomy, and many provisions specifically reflecting the interests and wishes of minority nationalities. Article 3 of the General Principles impressed me the most and touched me the most deeply. This article states: “The People's Republic of China is a unified multi-ethnic country. All nationalities are equal. Discrimination against and oppression of any nationality are prohibited, and acts undermining the unity of the nationalities are prohibited. All nationalities have the freedom to develop their own spoken and written languages, and have the freedom to preserve or reform their own customs and habits and religious beliefs. Regional autonomy is practiced in areas where minority nationalities live in concentrated communities. All national autonomous areas are inseparable parts of the People's Republic of China.” As I repeatedly read this article, I couldn't help but think of you, of the various fraternal nationalities on the Yunnan border. I was thinking: How happy the people and soldiers of these fraternal nationalities, who have suffered all kinds of discrimination and oppression from the Kuomintang Han chauvinists, must be when they hear the broadcast of the Draft Constitution! At this time, although I was in Beijing, my heart returned to the border, back to Kawa Mountain.

    The suffering and struggles you experienced in the past, your ideals and hopes in the past, and the joy and happiness in your life today, all reappeared in my mind.

    I remember, on the night of April 21st, I went to visit you. Your own experience is an example of how much suffering your nationality endured and finally gained freedom and happiness. You lost both your parents at the age of eight. To bury them, your brother exchanged a coffin for a Han landlord, and you yourself exchanged two lengths of white cloth for a Han landlord. The remains of your parents were buried, but from then on, the whole family was scattered. You and your brother became slaves of Han landlords. After liberation, you joined the army and became a people's soldier. You performed meritorious service several times in suppressing the remaining bandits! You have become the protector of the peace and happiness of all nationalities. That night, you also told me a story that your grandfather had told you, a story I will never forget. It was still in the Qing Dynasty. One year, Lancang, Linjiang, and other places suffered from continuous drought. The Lahu people could only fill their stomachs with wild mountain vegetables, but the Simao Town Border Governor still sent Qing soldiers to extort and plunder. The Lahu people, unable to bear it any longer, rose up to resist and killed eight Qing soldiers who were collecting grain. Later, the Qing government came to retaliate, burning villages and killing people in every stockaded village. The heroic and unyielding Lahu people made great sacrifices. To commemorate the dead, the following two folk songs are circulating among the Lahu people: "When the flowers wither, the seeds remain, and the flowers bloom every year." Indeed, the blood of the martyrs was not shed in vain, and the Lahu people's resistance struggle continued.

    Moreover, the fate of the Kawa people, who live in the same area as the Lahu people, was equally tragic. They were forced to live in remote and desolate plateaus. Men and women were naked all year round. When it was cold, they warmed themselves with labor during the day and huddled around the fire pit at night, living a difficult life like primitive people. Even so, the imperialists and the Kuomintang had to plunder and oppress them, trying to conquer and eliminate them. But the Kawa people are also a heroic and unyielding nationality. Thus, history is filled with the Kawa people's heroic resistance against imperialism and the reactionary ruling class's bloody struggles to conquer them. In 1916, Tang Jiyao, the governor of Yunnan Province, sent eight companies of soldiers to attack Kawa Mountain, aggressively reaching the Lasinong stockaded village. But the brave and strong Kawa people did not retreat or disperse. Every tribe and every stockaded village joined in this battle to defend the survival of their nationality. They used crossbows instead of guns, stones instead of bullets, and wooden drums instead of "foreign bugles," fighting the invading bandits in the valleys, in the forests, on every necessary road, and in the grass all over the mountains and plains. As a result, the bandit commander, Shen, was shot dead by a sharp arrow, and the bandits were thrown into chaos. The Kawa people took advantage of the victory to counterattack and pursue, causing the conquerors to suffer the fate of having most of their men and guns destroyed.

    Later, the Kuomintang repeatedly sent "reclamation groups" and "development groups" to Kawa Mountain, continuing to cruelly suppress and plunder the Kawa people, while also creating ethnic disputes, attempting to conquer and "assimilate" this nationality. Although the resistance and struggle of the Kawa people never stopped, the life of the Kawa people became increasingly bitter. As a folk song says: "The Kuomintang has a wolf's heart, forcing us to pay for food and money, making us Kawa people so pitiful, we can't even find a pair of pants to wear."

    In old China, the Kawa and Lahu nationalities, who had always suffered discrimination and oppression, longed for a life of equality and happiness! In Kawa Mountain, there is such a mythical legend: As far back as four hundred years ago, there was an old man named Kunyang in Daluo Village. He was a person on Kawa Mountain who was good at doing things and respected by all the people. He lived to be sixty years old and deeply felt the oppression and suffering of his fellow tribesmen throughout his life. Before he died, he called the people in the village to him and said painfully: "I am going to leave you!" The people in the village were shocked and secretly shed tears when they heard his words of farewell! Then, the old man told everyone: "No matter how we Kawa are bullied, you must never give in. Endure it! In another four hundred years, a new kind of Han Chinese will come to Kawa Mountain. They will not rob the Kawa people, they will not torture the Kawa people, and they will bring salt and cloth to the Kawa people, teach the Kawa people how to farm, and teach the Kawa people how to read. By that time, in our village, the beams of every household will be full of corn, the bamboo tubes will be full of rice grains, there will be herds of pigs and cattle under the thatched houses, and groups of children will be playing in the houses..."

    How fresh and encouraging these words were to the Kawa people! After the old man finished speaking, he closed his eyes peacefully.

    Although people felt great grief over the old man's death, the old man's words made everyone look forward to that day, so this mythical legend was passed down from generation to generation among the Kawa people. The old man's words reflected the traditional friendship between the Kawa people and the people of all nationalities in the motherland, and reflected the ideals and wishes of the Kawa people for the motherland and their own nationality for many years. In 1952, the People's Liberation Army came to Kawa Mountain. The People's Liberation Army brought the Communist Party's ethnic policies to Kawa Mountain, helping the fraternal nationalities in Kawa Mountain to mediate disputes, develop production, build water conservancy projects, and establish schools, and transported a large number of salt and cloth from the interior. The girls who used to be unclothed are now wearing calico clothes, and the bamboo tubes that used to be empty all year round are now filled with rice grains. Pigs and cattle have increased, and so have children. People are excitedly talking about: "Old man Kunyang's dream has come true."

    Dear Comrade Yuan Yingzhong, let us jointly cheer and celebrate this Draft Constitution that reflects the ideals and wishes of all nationalities! In order to defend the hard-won happy life of the fraternal nationalities in the border region, in order to defend the great achievements of the people's revolution, and in order to defend the socialist construction of the motherland, as border soldiers, your task is so glorious and arduous! Until now, I still clearly remember the words you said so excitedly when you held my hand tightly when I left Kawa Mountain. You said: "Comrade Zhao, this time the national people's delegation to comfort the People's Liberation Army came to the border to comfort us. This is the greatest honor I have ever felt in my life. We have nothing else more noble to repay the love and care of the people of the motherland and Chairman Mao, but our border soldiers have a common determination: to unite the fraternal nationalities in the border region, guard the southwest gate well, and build the border region of the motherland as solid as a wall of copper and iron. If the enemy dares to invade, we will eliminate them on the border."

    Dear comrade, your determination is precisely the wish of the people of the motherland. Finally, I sincerely hope that you can realize your determination: perform meritorious service for the people in defending and building the border region, and come to Beijing to see Chairman Mao.

### 你们的愿望写在宪法草案上了

    你们的愿望写在宪法草案上了
    赵忠信亲爱的边疆战士袁应忠同志：
    五月十日我们从云南边疆卡瓦山上分别，六月十四日我已回到祖国的心脏——北京了。
    我回来的第二天，正逢一个喜日子。这天，中华人民共和国宪法草案公布了。我怀着兴奋的心情，一气读完了宪法草案的全文。整个宪法草案都充满了民族平等的精神，有专门一节规定民族区域自治，有很多条文都特别反映了少数民族的利益和愿望。总纲第三条给我的印象最深，感触最多。这条写道：“中华人民共和国是统一的多民族的国家。各民族一律平等。禁止对任何民族的歧视和压迫，禁止破坏各民族团结的行为。各民族都有发展自己的语言文字的自由，都有保持或者改革自己的风俗习惯和宗教信仰的自由。各少数民族聚居的地方实行区域自治。各民族自治地方都是中华人民共和国不可分离的部分。”当我反复地阅读这条的时候，我不由得想起了你，想起了云南边疆的各个兄弟民族。我在想：过去这些受尽国民党大汉族主义者们歧视压迫的兄弟民族人民和战士们，当听到宪法草案的广播的时候，该是如何高兴啊！这时，我虽然身在北京，但我的心却回到边疆，回向卡瓦山了。
    你过去经历的苦难和斗争，你过去的理想和希望，你今天生活里的愉快和幸福，都在我的脑海里重新出现了。
    记得，四月二十一日的夜晚，我去访问了你，你自己的经历就是你们这个民族忍受了多少苦难而最后得到了自由幸福的一个例子。你八岁上死了双亲，为了埋葬双亲，你哥哥换了汉族地主的一口棺材，你自己换了汉族地主的两丈白布，双亲的遗体是掩埋了，可是从此，全家就这样失散了，你和你的哥哥就成了汉族地主的奴隶。解放以后，你参了军，成了一个人民的战士，你在剿灭残匪中立了几次功！你已经成了各族人民和平幸福的保卫者了。那天晚上你还对我叙述了你祖父给你讲过的一个故事，这个故事我永远不能忘记。那还是满清时代，有一年澜沧、临江等地连年荒旱，拉祜族只能以山茅野菜充饥，可是思茅镇边总督仍派清兵来勒索搜括，拉祜族忍无可忍地起来反抗了，杀死了征粮的八名清兵，后来清政府又来报复，见村烧村，遇寨杀寨，英勇不屈的拉祜族人民有很大牺牲。为纪念死了的人们，在拉祜族中流传着这样两句民歌：“鲜花开罢籽长在，年年开出鲜花来。”的确，烈士们的血没有白流，拉祜族人民的反抗斗争一直继续着。
    还有，和拉祜族生活在一个地区的卡瓦族的命运同样是悲惨的。他们被迫聚居在偏僻荒凉的高原上，男男女女，一年四季都是赤身露体，天冷的时候，白天用劳动取暖，夜晚就缩在火塘旁边住宿，过着和原始人一样的困苦生活。就这样，帝国主义和国民党还要对他们进行掠夺和压迫。想把他们征服和消灭，而卡瓦族也是一个英勇不屈的民族。于是，在历史上就充满了卡瓦族人民英勇反抗帝国主义和反动统治阶级企图征服他们的流血斗争。一九一六年，云南省长唐继尧，曾派八个连的兵力去进攻卡瓦山，气势汹汹地打到了拉斯弄寨，可是勇敢强悍的卡瓦族人民，没有退让，没有逃散，每个部落，每个寨子，都投入了这次保卫本民族生存的战斗里。他们没有枪用弩，没有子弹用石块，没有“洋号”用木鼓，在山谷间，在森林里，在每个必经的要道上，在漫山遍野的草丛里，和进犯的匪帮战斗。结果匪帮的沈司令被一枝利箭射死了，匪帮乱成了一团，卡瓦族人民乘胜回攻和追击，使征服者们遭到了人枪大部覆灭的命运。
    后来，国民党又曾三番五次地派遣什么“垦殖团”呀、“开垦团”呀到卡瓦山上来，一面继续对卡瓦族人民进行残酷镇压和掠夺，一面又制造民族纠纷，企图征服和“同化”这个民族。虽然卡瓦族人民的反抗和斗争从来没有停息，可是卡瓦族人民的生活越来越苦了。正像一首民谣所说的：“国民党狼心肝，逼我们的粮食又要款，弄的我卡瓦真可怜，一条裤子也找不到穿。”　　在旧中国，历来受尽歧视和压迫的卡瓦族和拉祜族，是多么渴望平等幸福的生活啊！在卡瓦山有这样一个神话般的传说：远在四百年前，达洛寨有一个名叫昆阳的老人，他是卡瓦山上一位会办事情受全族人民尊敬的人，他活了六十岁，一生深切地感受到同族人受的压迫和痛苦，他在临死前，曾把寨里的人叫到跟前，沉痛地说：“我要离开你们了！”寨里的人听了他这句诀别的话，有的感到震惊，有的暗暗掉泪！接着，这位老人又嘱托大家说：“不管我们卡瓦怎样受人欺侮，你们千万不能屈服，你们熬着吧！再过四百年，卡瓦山要来一种新汉人，他们不抢卡瓦，不拷卡瓦，还给卡瓦运来盐巴和布匹，教咱卡瓦种地，教咱卡瓦读书识字。到那时候，我们寨子里，家家户户的梁上挂满着包谷，竹筒里盛满着稻谷粒，茅屋下会有成群的猪牛，房子里会嬉戏着成群的娃娃……”。　　这些话对卡瓦族人民是多么新鲜和有多大鼓舞力量啊！老人说完了这段话，就安详地闭上眼睛了。
    人们虽然对老人的去世感到很大悲痛，但老人的话又使大家期待着那一天，于是这个神话般的传说就在卡瓦族人民中间一代一代地向下传了。老人的话，反映了卡瓦族人民与祖国各族人民的传统的友谊，反映了卡瓦族人民多少年来对祖国和本民族的理想和愿望。一九五二年卡瓦山开来了人民解放军，解放军把共产党的民族政策带进了卡瓦山，帮助卡瓦山各兄弟民族调解纠纷、发展生产、兴修水利、创办学校，并从内地运去了大批的盐巴和布匹。过去衣不蔽体的姑娘们，现在也穿上了花布衣服，过去长年空洞洞的竹筒，现在都盛满了稻谷粒。猪、牛多起来了，娃娃也多起来了。人们在兴奋地谈论着：“昆阳老人的理想实现了。”
    亲爱的袁应忠同志，让我们共同为这部反映了各民族的理想和愿望的宪法草案而欢呼庆祝吧！为了保卫边疆各兄弟民族既得的幸福生活，为了保卫人民革命的伟大成果，为了保卫祖国的社会主义建设，作为边疆战士，你们的任务是多么光荣而艰巨啊！直到现在，我还清晰地记得，当我离开卡瓦山时，你曾紧握着我的手很激动地说的那些话，你说：“赵同志，这次全国人民慰问人民解放军代表团到边疆来慰问我们，是我一生感到最大的荣誉，我们没有什么别的更高贵的东西来回答祖国人民和毛主席的热爱和关怀，可是我们边疆战士有着一个共同的决心：要团结好边疆的兄弟民族，守好西南大门，把祖国边疆建设得像铜墙铁壁一样，敌人如果敢来侵犯，就把它消灭在国境线上。”
    亲爱的同志，你的决心正是祖国人民的愿望。最后我真诚地盼望你能实现你的决心：在保卫和建设边疆中为人民立功，到北京来见毛主席。
