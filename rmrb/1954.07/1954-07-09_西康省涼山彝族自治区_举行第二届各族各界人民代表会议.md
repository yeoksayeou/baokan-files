    The Second Session of the People's Representative Conference of All Ethnic Groups in the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Region of Xikang Province was held from June 17th to 26th. The conference summarized the work since the establishment of the autonomous region, determined the tasks for the future, and elected representatives to the Provincial People's Congress.
    One hundred and fifty-seven representatives of the Yi, Miao, and Han ethnic groups from seven counties in the region attended the conference. The representatives listened to the work report of Wazhamuji (Yi ethnicity), Chairman of the People's Government of the Autonomous Region. In the past year or more, the autonomous region has further strengthened ethnic unity, and the historical divisions between ethnic groups and the feuds within the Yi ethnic group have been further eliminated and reduced, resulting in considerable achievements in various construction undertakings in the autonomous region. In the discussions, the representatives unanimously agreed that this was inseparable from the leadership of the Communist Party, the higher-level People's Government, and the assistance of the Han people. They all expressed their infinite gratitude in their speeches.
    In accordance with the Party's general task on ethnic issues during the transition period, the conference decided that the autonomous region will continue to vigorously carry out propaganda and education on ethnic unity through various tasks, strengthen social security work, and continue to consolidate the unity of all ethnic groups. After detailed discussions, the representatives made some specific decisions and passed a resolution on the Patriotic Unity Covenant. The conference decided that local people's governments must strengthen their leadership over agricultural production and earnestly do a good job in distributing agricultural tools and agricultural loans; carry out typical demonstrations of improved agricultural production and cultivate model laborers in key areas. Sideline and animal husbandry production are closely related to the economic life of the Yi people, and the conference believes that assistance should be given to the Yi people to develop the production of local specialties according to different circumstances. In addition, focusing on ethnic unity and development of production, the conference also made arrangements for carrying out health, cultural, and educational undertakings in the autonomous region. Finally, after consultation, the conference elected twenty-two representatives to the Provincial People's Congress. (Xinhua News Agency)
