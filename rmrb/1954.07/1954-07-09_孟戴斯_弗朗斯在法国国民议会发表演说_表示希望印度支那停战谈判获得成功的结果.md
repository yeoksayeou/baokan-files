Xinhua News Agency, July 8th: TASS, Paris, July 7th: French Prime Minister Mendès France delivered a speech at the French National Assembly during the daytime session on the 7th. He discussed the military measures his government was implementing in Indochina. Mendès France first reported that he was about to depart for Geneva to conduct negotiations regarding the Indochina armistice. Mendès France expressed his hope that these negotiations would achieve a successful outcome. He said, "I have said that we have every reason to hope that the negotiations will reach a favorable and glorious conclusion. That is my current opinion."

However, Mendès France continued, "Between hope and confidence, there is a distance that must be overcome," and the government should "anticipate everything in time, so as to be able to deal calmly with any unexpected events."

In this regard, Mendès France added that if an agreement on an armistice could not be reached by July 20th, then the French government should "ensure the rescue of the expeditionary force and maintain a sufficiently strong military machine on the ground."

The French Prime Minister then said that the military measures taken to strengthen the Indochina expeditionary force were to prevent the unlikely failure of the armistice negotiations. He said, "If war has to resume in Indochina, then the use of only core troops will not be enough to ensure that the expeditionary force receives the massive reinforcements necessary to sustain the war." He continued, "Therefore, the only way to solve the above problem at present is to send the main reserve forces to the Far East, which is the purpose for which the previous government established this reserve army. These reserve forces include personnel serving in the military according to law, in other words, those of conscription age."

    孟戴斯—弗朗斯在法国国民议会发表演说
    表示希望印度支那停战谈判获得成功的结果
     【新华社八日讯】塔斯社巴黎七日讯：法国政府总理孟戴斯—弗朗斯在法国国民议会七日白天的会议上发表演说。他谈到他的政府在印度支那所实施的军事方面的措施。孟戴斯—弗朗斯首先报告说，他即将动身到日内瓦去，以进行关于印度支那停战的谈判。孟戴斯—弗朗斯表示希望这次谈判能获得成功的结果。他说：“我已经说过，我们完全有根据可以希望谈判达成有利和光荣的结局。我目前的意见就是这样。”
    但是，孟戴斯—弗朗斯接着说：“在希望和信心之间存在着必须加以克服的距离”，政府应当“及时预料到一切，以便足以从容地对付任何意外事件”。
    孟戴斯—弗朗斯就这方面补充说，如果到七月二十日还不能够达成关于停战的协定，那么法国政府就应当“保证拯救远征军，在当地保持足够强大的军事机器”。
    法国政府总理然后说，实行加强印度支那远征军的军事措施，是为了预防停战谈判的万一失败。他说，“如果一旦在印度支那不得不恢复战争，那么仅仅使用基干军队就不足以保证远征军能得到为了维持战争所必要的大量增援部队。”他接着说：“因此，目前可能解决上述问题的唯一办法是把主要的后备部队派遣到远东去，前任政府就是为这一目的而建立这支后备军的。这些后备军包括根据法律而服兵役的人员，换句话说，就是那些役龄壮丁。”
