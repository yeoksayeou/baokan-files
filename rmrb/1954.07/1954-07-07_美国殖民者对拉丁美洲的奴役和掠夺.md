    American Colonialists' Enslavement and Plunder of Latin America
    Li Gao
    The event of the United States using violent means to subvert the legitimate government of Guatemala has once again exposed the imperialist face of the United States in enslaving the national sovereignty of weak countries, interfering in other countries' internal affairs, and destroying democratic freedom. This event also reflects that the colonial enslavement of Latin America by American monopoly capital has encountered increasingly strong resistance from the Latin American people.
    As is well known, the United States has always regarded Latin America as its rear base for dominating the world under the banner of the "Monroe Doctrine." After two world wars, the United States squeezed out and weakened the power of its competitors, Germany and Britain, in Latin America, and Latin America became almost entirely the private property of the United States.
    The history of American capitalism, from the very beginning, has been a history of almost continuous interference and wars of plunder on the American continent. In order to invade the countries and nations of the American continent, the United States has waged more than a hundred wars. Mexico, whose territory was much larger than that of the United States, has been reduced to a small country as a result of the US's invasion and plunder of its territory. Since the 20th century, the United States has continued to unscrupulously interfere in the internal affairs of Latin American countries, using various despicable means to strengthen the enslavement and exploitation of Latin America by American monopoly capitalists. General Butler, whose hands were stained with the blood of the Latin American people, bluntly said: "In 1914, I helped make Mexico, especially Tampico, suitable for American oil interests. I helped make Haiti and Cuba suitable places for New York's Citibank to collect profits.... From 1909 to 1920, I helped the international banking firm Brown Brothers clear Nicaragua. In 1916, I opened up the Dominican Republic for American sugar capitalists. In 1903, I helped make Honduras a suitable place for the United Fruit Company." (Foster: "Outline of American Political History")
    Now, we have seen figures like the US Ambassador to Guatemala, Peurifoy, and the Director of the US Central Intelligence Agency, Allen Dulles, being praised by American bosses, just like Butler back then. The US "New York Daily News" wrote: It has become "increasingly clear that US Ambassador Peurifoy played a huge role in the overthrow of the Arbenz government. For this, we believe that Peurifoy should receive warm applause from his American compatriots (should be read as Wall Street bosses and the Washington ruling group)." Hearst's syndicated columnist Pegler also publicly stated that it is the "obvious responsibility" of the CIA to "organize, incite, and exploit" "revolutions" like the one in Guatemala.
    In this way, American colonialists have established a colonial empire in Latin America that creates poverty, backwardness, death, and unrest. American monopoly capital carries out the most brutal exploitation and plunder in Latin American countries; American war planners are increasingly stepping up their efforts to organize military blocs, increase military bases, collect cannon fodder, and plunder strategic materials in Latin America.
    From 1941 to 1951, US investment in Latin America increased from 3.7 billion US dollars to 7 billion US dollars, an increase of nearly double. American monopoly capital controls almost all of Latin America's iron sand, bauxite, manganese, and platinum, nine-tenths of its copper, seven-tenths of its silver, two-thirds of its zinc, and more than half of its oil production. In recent years, the United States has also been trying its best to plunder atomic materials such as uranium and thorium from countries such as Brazil. American monopoly companies occupy many of the best lands in Latin American countries, monopolizing local agricultural production and the processing and export of agricultural products. The "United Fruit Company," known as the "Green Devil," owns 600,000 acres (more than 3.6 million mu) of land in Central American countries and controls local shipping, railways, radio communications, electricity, and streetcar systems. The American sugar refining companies in Cuba occupy 300,000 acres of good land and control 60% of Cuba's sugar industry. These American monopoly companies have sucked the blood of the Latin American people, and their profits are shockingly high. For example, the "United Fruit Company" extracts profits of 70 million to 100 million US dollars every year in Central American countries, which is almost equal to the total national budget revenue of the four countries of Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica in 1950. The profits of the two American companies, "Anaconda Copper Mining Company" and "Braden Copper Company" in Chile, are equivalent to two-thirds of the Chilean national budget. The net profit of "Braden Copper Company" in 1953 was eight times the total capital registered by the company in Chile. The profit of the US "General Motors Company" from its investment in Latin America in 1951 was four times higher than the profit rate of the company's various enterprises in the United States.
    Under the long-term plunder of the United States and other colonialists, Latin American countries have become deformed single-raw material producing countries. For example, 90% of Cuba's national economic income relies on sugar, 96% of Venezuela's exports are oil (crude oil), the main products of Central American countries are coffee and bananas, Uruguay relies on animal husbandry, Bolivia relies on tin, Chile relies on copper and nitrate, and Brazil relies on coffee, cotton, and cocoa. These countries must sell their single raw material products every year to exchange for all or most of the industrial products and food needed by the whole country. American monopoly capital groups take the opportunity to carry out manipulation, monopoly, and exploitation. American monopoly capital controls the foreign trade of Latin American countries, hinders their economic ties with regions outside the Americas, and hinders mutual exchange between Latin American countries. More than half (as much as 80% or 90%) of the import and export trade of Latin American countries is with the United States. American monopoly capital often strengthens its exploitation of Latin America by suppressing raw material prices, raising industrial product prices, and raising freight rates, and also often uses means such as increasing taxes, limiting prices, suspending purchases, and reducing imports to severely hit Latin American countries. For example, last year the United States stopped purchasing tin from Bolivia, attempting to bankrupt Bolivia. Recently, the United States' implementation of coffee price limits has caused Brazil to suffer a loss of 54 million US dollars every year.
    At the same time, American monopoly enterprises collude with a small number of large landowners in Latin America to maintain the medieval feudal land ownership system. In Latin American countries, 5% of landowners (including foreign monopoly companies) occupy 75% of all arable land, while most farmers have no land. Cruel land rent exploitation and serf-like enslavement have led to a surprising decline in agriculture in Latin America. From 1934 to 1938, the output of five major grains in Latin America was 28.7 million tons, while in 1951 it dropped to 24.5 million tons, a decrease of 15%. The vast majority of the population of Latin American countries is trapped in poverty and bankruptcy. Latin America, which is rich in natural resources, has become a "dark continent" in the world.
    The US Pentagon is stepping up its efforts to build Latin America into a war base. At the Rio de Janeiro Conference in 1947, the United States forced Latin American countries to undertake the obligation of engaging in "military cooperation" with the United States. In recent years, under the guise of "common security," it has forced Latin American countries to sign bilateral military agreements with the United States. Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Uruguay, Peru, Cuba, Ecuador, and other countries have been tied to the American war chariot through such agreements. The United States establishes military bases on their territories, and sends "military delegations," "advisers," and so-called "technicians" to control the military, political, and economic institutions of these countries, and forces them to increase military spending significantly every year to implement the US policy of arms expansion and war preparation. As long as the governments of Latin American countries slightly contradict the will of the United States, the United States will exert barbaric pressure on them, or launch a coup d'état to overthrow them.
    Under these circumstances, American colonialists have aroused increasingly strong resistance from the people of Latin American countries. In recent years, the struggle of Latin American workers for survival rights has greatly developed. The voice of farmers demanding land reform is also getting louder and louder. An increasingly broad social stratum has joined the movement to resist the enslavement of American monopoly capital and oppose turning Latin American countries into American war bases. This powerful people's movement has forced the governments of some Latin American countries to refuse to sign bilateral military treaties with the United States, and some governments have openly opposed American monopoly capital. Guatemala is the most prominent example. Some of the achievements that the Guatemalan people have made in opposing the enslavement of American monopoly capital have had a significant impact in Latin America. As the two American writers Travis and Magill, who visited Guatemala, said: "A fresh wind is blowing across Latin America... This fresh wind of freedom and liberation brings hope to the millions of enslaved and trampled people." More and more Latin American people see that only by getting rid of the enslavement of American monopoly capital can they strive for their own survival and development. Therefore, the national liberation movement is booming. Driven by the people's movement, the Bolivian government also announced in 1952 that it would nationalize the tin mines belonging to foreigners, and promulgated the Land Reform Law in August 1953. Many Latin American countries that used to follow the United States' orders also put forward many proposals related to economic issues at the "Tenth Pan-American Conference" in March this year, uniting to resist American economic plunder. The bills on land reform in Latin American countries proposed by Guatemala and Bolivia were passed by an absolute majority. These facts show that the foundation of the American colonial empire in Latin America has begun to shake.

    美国殖民者对拉丁美洲的奴役和掠夺
    李高
    美国用暴力手段颠覆危地马拉合法政府的事件，又一次暴露了美国奴役弱小国家的民族主权、干涉他国内政、摧残民主自由的帝国主义面目。这一事件，也反映了美国垄断资本在拉丁美洲的殖民奴役已遭遇拉丁美洲人民愈来愈强烈的反抗。
    如所周知，美国一直是打着“门罗主义”的招牌，把拉丁美洲视为它称霸世界的后方基地的。经过两次世界大战，美国排挤和削弱了它的竞争者——德、英两国在拉丁美洲的势力之后，拉丁美洲几乎完全变成了美国的禁脔。
    美国资本主义的历史，从一开始起，就是一部在美洲大陆上几乎不间断地进行干涉和掠夺战争的历史。为了侵犯美洲大陆各国和各民族，美国进行了一百次以上战争。领土比美国大得多的墨西哥被美国侵略和掠夺领土的结果，已降为一个小国。二十世纪以来，美国继续肆无忌惮地干涉拉丁美洲各国的内政，使用各种卑鄙手段来加强美国垄断资本家在拉丁美洲的奴役和剥削。双手染满了拉丁美洲人民的鲜血的巴特勒将军曾直言不讳地说：“我在一九一四年帮助使墨西哥、特别是使坦比哥适合于美国的石油利益。我帮助使海地和古巴成为纽约花旗银行收取进益的适当场所……。一九○九至一九二○年，我帮助过国际银行企业布朗兄弟公司去扫清尼加拉瓜。在一九一六年我又替美国的糖业资本家开辟了多米尼加共和国。一九○三年，我又帮助使洪都拉斯成为一处适宜于联合果品公司的场所。”（福斯特：“美洲政治史纲”）
    现在，我们又看到了美国驻危地马拉大使普里弗伊和美国中央情报局局长艾伦·杜勒斯这样的人物，正像当年巴特勒那样，受到美国大老板的歌颂。美国“纽约每日新闻”写道：事情已“愈来愈明显，美国大使普里弗伊在推翻阿本斯政府的事件中是起了巨大的作用的。为此，我们认为普里弗伊是应该得到他的美国同胞（应读作华尔街老板和华盛顿统治集团）热烈喝采的”。赫斯特系报纸专栏作家佩格勒也公开说：“组织、引起并利用”像危地马拉那样的“革命”是中央情报局的“明显的职责”。
    美国殖民主义者就这样地在拉丁美洲建立了制造贫困、落后、死亡和不安的殖民帝国。美国垄断资本在拉丁美洲各国进行最残酷的剥削和掠夺；美国战争策划者日益加紧地在拉丁美洲组织军事集团、增设军事基地、搜罗作战炮灰和掠取战略物资。
    从一九四一年到一九五一年，美国在拉丁美洲的投资已由三十七亿美元增至七十亿美元，即增加了将近一倍。美国垄断资本控制了拉丁美洲几乎全部的铁砂、铁矾土、锰和铂、十分之九的铜、十分之七的银、三分之二的锌和一半以上的石油的生产。近年来美国又在极力掠取巴西等国的铀、钍等原子物资。美国的垄断公司占领了拉丁美洲国家许多最好的土地，垄断着当地的农业生产和农产品的加工与输出。被称为“绿色魔鬼”的“联合果品公司”，在中美各国拥有土地六十万英亩（合三百六十余万市亩），并控制着当地的航运、铁道、无线电通讯、电力和电车系统。在古巴的美国炼糖公司，占有三十万英亩良好土地，并控制着古巴制糖工业的百分之六十。这些美国垄断公司吸尽了拉丁美洲人民的膏血，它们获利之高是骇人听闻的。例如
  “联合果品公司”在中美各国每年榨取七千万到一亿美元的利润，这个数目差不多等于危地马拉、洪都拉斯、尼加拉瓜和哥斯达黎加等四个国家在一九五○年的国家预算收入的总和。在智利的美国“安那昆铜矿公司”和“布拉登铜矿公司”两家，所获利润就相当于智利国家预算的三分之二。“布拉登铜矿公司”在一九五三年所得纯利，为这个公司在智利登记了的资本总额的八倍。美国“通用汽车公司”一九五一年在拉丁美洲投资的利润，比这个公司在美国国内各企业的利润率还高四倍。
    在美国和其他殖民主义者的长期掠夺下，拉丁美洲国家都变成了畸形的单一原料出产国。例如古巴的国民经济收入百分之九十依靠糖，委内瑞拉的出口百分之九十六是石油（原油），中美各国主要产品是咖啡和香蕉，乌拉圭依靠畜产，玻利维亚依靠锡，智利依靠铜和硝石，巴西依靠咖啡、棉花和可可。这些国家每年必须卖掉它们的单一性的原料产品，换回全国所需的工业品和粮食的全部或大部。美国垄断资本集团就从中实行操纵、垄断和剥削。美国垄断资本控制着拉丁美洲国家的对外贸易，阻碍它们与美洲以外地区的经济联系，并且阻碍拉丁美洲各国之间的互通有无。拉丁美洲各国的进口和出口贸易有一半以上（多的到百分之八、九十）是和美国来往的。美国垄断资本经常以压低原料价格、提高工业品价格和抬高运费等办法来加强对拉丁美洲的剥削，而且还时常用加税、限价、停购、削减进口等等手段，严重地打击拉丁美洲国家。例如，去年美国停购玻利维亚的锡，企图使玻利维亚破产。最近美国实行咖啡限价，就使巴西每年蒙受五千四百万美元的损失。
    与此同时，美国垄断企业又和拉丁美洲的一小撮大地主互相勾结，维持着中世纪式的封建性的土地占有制度。在拉丁美洲国家中，百分之五的土地所有者（包括外国垄断公司）占有全部耕地的百分之七十五，而大多数农民没有土地。残酷的地租剥削和农奴式的奴役，使得拉丁美洲的农业惊人地衰退。在一九三四年到一九三八年，拉丁美洲五种主要谷物的产量是二千八百七十万吨，而一九五一年降至二千四百五十万吨，即降低了百分之十五。拉丁美洲各国人口的绝大多数的农民陷于贫困和破产的境地。自然资源丰富的拉丁美洲，却成了世界上的一个“黑暗大陆”。
    美国的五角大楼正在加紧把拉丁美洲建成战争基地。在一九四七年的里约热内卢会议中，美国迫使拉丁美洲各国承担了与美国从事“军事合作”的义务。近年来又以“共同安全”为名，强迫拉丁美洲国家和美国缔结双边的军事协定。巴西、哥伦比亚、智利、乌拉圭、秘鲁、古巴、厄瓜多尔等国，都已通过这种协定被缚在美国战车上。美国在它们的领土上建立军事基地，派遣“军事代表团”、
  “顾问”和所谓“技术人员”等控制着这些国家的军队和政治、经济机构，并迫使它们每年大量增加军费来执行美国的扩军备战政策。拉丁美洲国家的政府只要稍为抵触了一点美国的意旨，美国就对它们施以横蛮的压力，或者发动阴谋政变，把它推翻。
    在这种情况下，美国殖民主义者引起了拉丁美洲各国人民日益强烈的反抗。近年来，拉丁美洲工人为争取生存权利而进行的斗争有了很大的发展。农民要求土地改革的呼声也越来越高。越来越广泛的社会阶层投入了反抗美国垄断资本的奴役和反对把拉丁美洲国家变为美国战争基地的运动。这种强大的人民运动，已迫使一些拉丁美洲的国家的政府不得不拒绝和美国签订双边军事条约，而且某些政府已公开和美国垄断资本敌抗。危地马拉是其中最突出的一个。危地马拉人民反对美国垄断资本奴役所曾获得的一些成就，在拉丁美洲产生了重大的影响。正如访问过危地马拉的两个美国作家特拉维斯和马基尔所说的：“一阵新鲜的风吹遍拉丁美洲。……这股自由解放的鲜风给那千百万被奴役和践踏的人带来了希望。”越来越多的拉丁美洲人民看到，只有解脱美国垄断资本的奴役才能争取自己的生存和发展。因此，民族解放运动蓬勃发展。在人民运动的推动下，玻利维亚政府也在一九五二年宣布把属于外国人的锡矿收归国有，又在一九五三年八月颁布了土地改革法。许多过去唯美国之命是听的拉丁美洲国家，也在今年三月的“第十届泛美会议”上提出许多有关经济问题的提案，联合起来对抗美国的经济掠夺。危地马拉和玻利维亚提出的在拉丁美洲国家实行土地改革的议案，以绝对多数获得通过。这样一些事实显示，美国在拉丁美洲的殖民帝国的根基，已经动摇起来了。
