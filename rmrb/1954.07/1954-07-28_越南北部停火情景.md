    Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, July 27th: Our correspondent Dai Shulin reported on the ceasefire situation in the North Vietnamese war zone: For many days, this morning (the 27th) was the first quiet morning. There was no artillery fire, no gunfire, and clusters of green trees and endless rice seedlings swayed gently in the morning breeze. Peace has come to the North Vietnamese plains.

    At the moment when the ceasefire was realized in the North Vietnamese battlefield—7:00 AM Vietnam Democratic Republic standard time (8:00 AM Beijing time), the reporter came to the edge of the Zhongjia demilitarized zone to observe the ceasefire situation on both sides. Seen clearly through binoculars: In the deep, weedy thickets in front of the French military strongholds outside the demilitarized zone, Vietnamese male and female guerrillas stood up. Carrying guns and mines, they moved north in groups of two or three, camouflaged branches and leaves waving above their heads, and the faint sound of their singing carried on the breeze.

    Looking further south, the French bunkers erected on the small hills and hidden in the distant groves were clearly visible. Just a few hours ago, these strongholds, flying the French flag, were still constantly firing artillery shells and flares. Although the Vietnamese People's Army and guerrillas had not conducted any combat operations against these strongholds since the Geneva Conference reached an agreement, these French soldiers were still living anxious days of war. Now—after 7:00 AM Vietnam local time, the French soldiers all ran out of the bunkers, breathing the fresh air in the sunlight. Peace has allowed them to survive.

    South of these bunker lines is the Red River Delta. Now, no artillery fire is heard from the heart of the Red River Delta—the direction of Hanoi. It is conceivable that the combat operations of the Vietnamese People's Army troops, which have been active there in recent years and have caused great consternation to the French troops in Hanoi, have all ceased. They are earnestly and well implementing the ceasefire order.

    越南北部停火情景
   【新华社北越二十七日电】本社记者戴澍霖报道越北战区的停火情景说：多少天来，今天早晨
  （二十七日）是第一个清静的早晨。这里没有炮声，也没有枪声，一丛丛的绿树和一望无际的秧苗在晨风中微微摆动。和平来到了北越平原。
    在北越战场实现停火的时刻——越南民主共和国标准时间上午七点钟（北京时间为上午八点钟）记者来到中稼非军事区边缘观看双方停火的情景。从望远镜中清晰地看到：在非军事区以外的法军据点前面的深厚的荒草丛中，越南的男女游击队员们站起来了。他们背着枪，提着地雷，三三两两地向北移动，伪装的树枝草叶在他们的头上幌动着，微风隐约传来他们的歌声。
    再向南望去，一座座竖立在小山上的和隐在远处树丛中的法军碉堡历历在目。就在几小时前，这些飘扬着法国旗的据点还不断地向外打炮和发出照明弹。虽然自从日内瓦会议达成协议以后，越南人民军和游击队再也没有对这些据点进行过战斗活动，但是这些法军士兵们仍然过着惶惶不安的战争日子。现在——越南当地时间七点钟以后，法军士兵都从碉堡里跑出来了，在阳光下尽情地呼吸新鲜空气。和平使他们幸存下来。
    这些碉堡线的南面，就是红河三角洲了。现在，红河三角洲的心脏——河内方向也没有炮声传来。可想而知：近年来，一直在那里活动的使河内法军惶恐不已的越南人民军部队的战斗行动都停止了。他们切实地良好地执行着停战的命令。
