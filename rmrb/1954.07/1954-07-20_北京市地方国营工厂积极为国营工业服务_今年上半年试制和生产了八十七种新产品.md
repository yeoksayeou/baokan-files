Beijing's local state-owned factories are actively serving state-owned industry, and in the first half of this year, they trial-produced and manufactured eighty-seven new types of products. According to the needs of various industrial departments, the Beijing Chemical Reagent Research Institute successfully trial-produced thirty types of analytical reagents and catalyst products needed for metallurgy, chemical and other industries in the first half of the year. In the past, most of these products relied on imports. Among them, more than 4,000 kilograms of six types have been produced in the first half of the year, supplying the needs of some steel factories in Anshan, Shanghai, Tangshan, and geological exploration teams in the southwest and other places. The Beijing Blueprint Paper Factory successfully trial-produced the second blueprint base paper, and more than 450 rolls have been produced in the first half of the year, which were timely supplied to the construction projects of Anshan Iron and Steel Company and the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant. The linen and felt tents produced by the Beijing Garment Factory have been sent to the construction sites of drilling teams in various parts of North China, providing them with protection from wind and rain in the high mountains and wilderness. The Beijing Metal Structure Factory manufactured a large number of transport vehicles for the state-owned Beijing No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory, and is currently rushing to manufacture steel windows for adjusting the air in the workshop for the state-owned Beijing No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory.

At the beginning of this year, many local state-owned factories in Beijing investigated and understood the needs of state-owned industries in various places. Based on the factory's equipment conditions, they formulated plans to increase new varieties. In order to ensure that the state-owned industry's requirements for the quality and specifications of new varieties are met, the factories attach great importance to trial production. Before trial-producing new varieties, the technical personnel and various sections and relevant workshops of some factories under the Beijing Building Materials Company jointly reviewed the drawings. After accepting the order for steel windows, the Beijing Metal Structure Factory held three technical research meetings, and workers and technicians put forward many rationalization proposals and improved the tools, finally successfully trial-producing the steel windows.

    北京市地方国营工厂积极为国营工业服务
    今年上半年试制和生产了八十七种新产品
    北京市地方国营工厂积极为国营工业服务，今年上半年试制和生产了八十七种新品种的产品。北京市化学试剂研究所根据各工业部门的需要，上半年试制成功了三十种冶金、化学等工业所需的分析试剂和触媒剂等产品。过去这些产品大部分是依靠进口的。其中的六种上半年已生产四千多公斤，供应了鞍山、上海、唐山等地的一些钢铁工厂和西南等地地质勘探队的需要。北京市晒图纸厂试制成功第二图底纸，上半年已生产了四百五十多卷，及时供应了鞍山钢铁公司和第一汽车制造厂建设工程的需要。北京市被服厂出产的亚麻布、毛毡做的帐篷，已送到华北各地钻探队工地，给他们在高山上和荒野里防御风雨。北京市金属结构工厂给国营北京第一棉纺织厂制造了大批托运车，目前正在给国营北京第二棉纺织厂赶制车间调节空气用的钢窗。
    北京市许多地方国营工厂在今年年初就调查、了解各地国营工业的需要。根据本厂设备条件，制订了增加新品种的计划。为了保证国营工业对新品种质量、规格的要求，各厂都很重视试制工作。北京市建筑器材公司所属部分厂在试制新品种之前，技术人员和各科室、各有关车间共同审查图纸。北京市金属结构工厂接受钢窗的订货后，召开了三次技术研究会，工人和技术人员提出很多合理化建议，改进了工具，终于试制成功。　（新华社）
