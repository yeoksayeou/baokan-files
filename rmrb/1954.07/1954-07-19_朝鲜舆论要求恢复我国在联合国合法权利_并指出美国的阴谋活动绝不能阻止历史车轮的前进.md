Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 18th: The Korean "Rodong Sinmun" published an editorial on the 17th entitled "Demanding the Restoration of the Legitimate Rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations." The editorial stated: The establishment of the People's Republic of China, a powerful and peace-loving nation in Asia, marks the entry of the history of the Eastern people into a new era. In recent years, the People's Republic of China has made great contributions to the lasting peace and human progress in Asia and the world with its great achievements in peaceful construction and its consistent peaceful foreign policy.

The editorial pointed out that the People's Republic of China's participation in the Geneva Conference as one of the five major powers has further enhanced its international prestige through the Geneva Conference. The Geneva Conference once again confirmed that it is difficult to solve any international problem without the participation of the great power of Asia, the People's Republic of China.

The editorial said that the friendly cooperation that has been established and developed recently between China and India, and between China and Burma, indicates that the mutual relations of the Asian people have entered a new era.

The editorial pointed out, however, that the U.S. imperialists have not abandoned their delusions of hindering the progress of the Asian people and continuing their aggression against China. U.S. imperialism is stepping up its conspiracy activities against the restoration of the People's Republic of China's legitimate rights in the United Nations.

The editorial said: Many countries in Asia and Europe believe that the legitimate status of the People's Republic of China should be restored in the United Nations. The United Nations cannot play its normal role without the participation of China, which accounts for a quarter of the world's population. The restoration of the legitimate rights of the Chinese people in the United Nations will help to normalize international relations and greatly promote the relaxation of international tensions and the maintenance and consolidation of peace.

The editorial concluded by saying that the Korean people, together with all peace-loving people in the world, resolutely demand the restoration of the People's Republic of China's legitimate rights in the United Nations.

The Korean Central News Agency issued a commentary on the 16th, saying: The recent clamor from the United States against the People's Republic of China's entry into the United Nations is very stale and will not have any effect. The commentary pointed out that with the convening of the Geneva Conference, the voices of various countries in the world demanding the restoration of the People's Republic of China's legitimate status in the United Nations and demanding the establishment of normal relations with it are rising. These voices reflect the wishes of upright humanity to peacefully resolve all international problems in order to ease international tensions. However, the U.S. war-mongers disregard the demands of the people of all countries and continue to carry out hostile actions and slander against the People's Republic of China.

The commentary further pointed out that the People's Republic of China has consistently adhered to a peaceful policy at the Geneva Conference and has thoroughly exposed the true colors of the enemies of peace. China's significant influence on the international stage makes it even more difficult for U.S. imperialism to implement its aggressive policies. Precisely for this reason, after the convening of the Geneva Conference, the U.S. rulers have more frantically carried out conspiracy activities against the People's Republic of China. However, such provocative actions by the United States cannot stop the advance of the wheel of history, cannot stop the voice of world public opinion demanding the restoration of the People's Republic of China's legitimate status in the United Nations, and even less can it damage the People's Republic of China's ever-increasing international prestige. It is clear that all conspiracy activities of the United States against the People's Republic of China will only make it more isolated.

    朝鲜舆论要求恢复我国在联合国合法权利
    并指出美国的阴谋活动绝不能阻止历史车轮的前进
    【新华社平壤十八日电】朝鲜“劳动新闻”十七日发表题为“要求恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利”的社论。社论说：亚洲的强有力的爱好和平的国家——中华人民共和国的建立，表明东方人民的历史已进入一个新的时代。近年来，中华人民共和国以它的和平建设的伟大成果，以始终如一的和平的对外政策，对亚洲和全世界的持久和平和人类进步作了巨大的贡献。
    社论指出中华人民共和国作为五大国之一参加日内瓦会议，通过日内瓦会议，中华人民共和国的国际威望更进一步提高。日内瓦会议再一次确证：没有亚洲的伟大的强国——中华人民共和国参加，要解决任何国际问题都是困难的。
    社论说，最近，在中国和印度、中国和缅甸之间建立和发展着的友好合作，表示亚洲人民的相互关系已进入一个新时代。
    社论指出，但是，美帝国主义者没有放弃阻挡亚洲人民前进和继续侵略中国的妄想。美帝国主义正在加紧阴谋活动，反对恢复中华人民共和国在联合国内的合法权利。
    社论说：亚洲和欧洲的许多国家认为应该恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法地位。没有占世界人口四分之一的中国的参加，联合国是不能起到它的正常作用的。而恢复中国人民在联合国的合法权利，将有助于使国际关系正常化，将大大地促进国际紧张局势的缓和与和平的维护和巩固。
    社论最后说，朝鲜人民和全世界爱好和平人民一道，坚决要求恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利。
    朝鲜中央通讯社十六日发表评论说：美国最近发出的反对中华人民共和国进入联合国的叫嚣，是很陈腐的，而且不会收到什么效果。评论指出，随着日内瓦会议的召开，世界各国要求恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法地位并要求和它建立正常关系的呼声正日益高涨。这些呼声反映了要求和平解决一切国际问题，以缓和国际紧张局势的正直人类的愿望。但是，美国战争贩子漠视各国人民的这种要求，继续进行反对中华人民共和国的敌对行动和诽谤中伤。
    评论进一步指出，中华人民共和国在日内瓦会议上始终坚持和平政策，并彻底揭露了和平的敌人的真面目。中国在国际舞台上的重大影响，使美帝国主义者更加难以执行它的侵略政策。正因为如此，在日内瓦会议召开以后，美国统治者更加疯狂地进行反对中华人民共和国的阴谋活动。但是，美国的这种挑衅行动不能阻止历史车轮的前进，不能阻挡世界舆论要求恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法地位的呼声，更不能损害中华人民共和国日益提高的国际威望。很显然，美国反对中华人民共和国的一切阴谋活动，必将使它自己更加孤立。
