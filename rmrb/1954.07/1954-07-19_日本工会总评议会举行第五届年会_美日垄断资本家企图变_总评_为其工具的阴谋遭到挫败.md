Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, July 17th: The fifth annual convention of Japan's largest trade union federation, the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan ("Sōhyō"), was held in Tokyo from the 12th to the 15th. More than 1,500 people attended the convention, including representatives from unions affiliated with "Sōhyō" and guests. The attempt by American and Japanese monopoly capital, using right-wing elements, to gradually transform "Sōhyō" into a tool serving rearmament and economic militarization through this annual convention was thwarted.

　　In his opening address, "Sōhyō" Chairman Fujita Fujitaro emphasized the importance of strengthening the unity of the Japanese working class. He said: Under the traitorous policies of the reactionary Yoshida government, the lives of Japanese workers have been devastated, their freedoms trampled upon, and their suffering is unbearable. Under these circumstances, the workers of "Sōhyō" must unite as one. He emphasized: This year must be a year of firmly uniting the labor front and advancing toward victory.

　　In his report on "Sōhyō's" work over the past year, "Sōhyō" Secretary-General Takano Minoru pointed out that the developments of the past year have proven that the policy adopted at the previous annual convention of opposing the U.S.-Japan "Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement" and safeguarding peace as the guiding principle of the labor movement was correct. He said: Official documents also show that labor conditions are rapidly deteriorating, and unemployment is increasing. Currently, the economic panic is becoming more profound day by day and is spreading from small and medium-sized enterprises to large enterprises. He pointed out that the rearmament carried out in accordance with the U.S.-Japan "Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement" has deeply harmed the entire Japanese industry and caused suffering to the people throughout the country. Under these circumstances, the conditions for expanding unified action are even more ripe. He also said: The struggle for peace has grown very strong over the past year. He pointed out that "Sōhyō's" task is to combine the workers' concrete and urgent demands with their desire for peace, and to seek progress on the basis of the achievements made in the past year.

　　In order to remove obstacles to accelerating rearmament, American and Japanese monopoly capitalists had been trying in every possible way to make "Sōhyō" implement retrogressive policies before the "Sōhyō" annual convention was held. They attacked the "Sōhyō" leadership through right-wing splinter elements within "Sōhyō," attempting to make "Sōhyō" an organization that would carry out so-called "legitimate trade union movement" within the rearmament system of the U.S.-Japan "Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement." In particular, they conspired to divide and disrupt "Sōhyō" through the election of "Sōhyō's" leadership at the annual convention.

　　However, the conspiracy of American and Japanese monopoly capital was resolutely opposed by the majority of delegates attending the annual convention. The delegates approved Takano Minoru's report and decided on the work policy for the coming year. This policy opposes the U.S.-Japan monopoly capital's policy of freezing wages and insists on the struggle to increase wages and break the fiscal and financial "tightening" policy that serves to strengthen economic militarization; it opposes layoffs and insists on the struggle to defend the workers' right to live. The annual convention also passed many resolutions, including supporting the struggle of Japanese workers employed by the U.S. military in Japan against layoffs, launching a movement against American atomic weapons testing, and demanding the dissolution of the reactionary Diet.

　　The annual convention re-elected "Sōhyō's" leadership. Fujita Fujitaro, chairman of the Japan Private Railway Workers' Union Federation, was re-elected as "Sōhyō" chairman. Takano Minoru was re-elected as "Sōhyō" secretary-general.

    日本工会总评议会举行第五届年会
    美日垄断资本家企图变“总评”为其工具的阴谋遭到挫败
    【新华社十七日讯】东京消息：日本最大的工会联合会——日本工会总评议会（“总评”）第五届年会已从十二日到十五日在东京举行。出席年会的有“总评”所属各工会的代表以及来宾共一千五百多人。美日垄断资本企图利用右翼分子通过这届年会来逐步变“总评”为替重整军备和经济军事化服务的御用工具的阴谋，遭到了挫败。
      在开幕会议上，“总评”主席藤田藤太郎致词时强调指出加强日本工人阶级团结的重要性。他说：在吉田反动政府的卖国政策下，日本的工人生活受到破坏，自由遭到蹂躏，苦不堪言。在这种情况下，“总评”的工人要团结一致。他着重说：今年必须是这样的一年：巩固地把劳工战线统一起来，向胜利前进。
    “总评”事务局长高野实在关于“总评”一年来的工作报告中指出：过去一年的形势发展证明，上届年会所制订的以反对美日“共同防御援助协定”和保卫和平为工人运动的方针，是正确的。他说：从官方的文件也可看出，劳工境况迅速恶化，失业越来越增加。目前，经济恐慌一天比一天深刻，并且正从中小企业向大企业扩展。他指出：按照美日“共同防御援助协定”所实行的重整军备，使整个日本产业深受其害，使全国人民受到痛苦。在这种情况下，扩大统一行动的条件已更加具备。他又说：一年来要求和平的斗争已经非常壮大。他指出：“总评”的任务是根据工人的和平愿望，结合工人具体的迫切要求，在过去一年获得的成果的基础上求得进步。
    美日垄断资本家为了扫除加紧重整军备的障碍，早在“总评”这届年会召开之前就千方百计地企图使“总评”实行倒退的政策，他们通过“总评”中的右翼分裂分子攻击“总评”的领导，企图使“总评”成为在美日“共同防御援助协定”的重整军备体制内进行所谓“合法工会运动”的组织。他们特别是阴谋通过年会上“总评”领导机构的改选来分裂和破坏“总评”。
    然而，美日垄断资本的阴谋受到出席年会的大多数代表的坚决反对。代表们批准了高野实的报告，并决定了今后一年的工作方针。这个方针反对美日垄断资本冻结工资的政策，坚持提高工资、打破为加强经济军事化服务的财政金融“紧缩”政策的斗争；反对解雇，坚持保卫工人生活权利的斗争。年会还通过许多决议，其中包括：支持驻日美军雇用的日本工人反对解雇的斗争，开展反对美国试验原子武器的运动，要求解散反动的国会等。
    年会改选了“总评”的领导机构。日本私营铁道工会总联合会主席藤田藤太郎连任“总评”主席。高野实连任“总评”事务局长。
