Respected Ambassador, Comrades, Friends!

Today is the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of Poland. On behalf of the Chinese people and the government of the People's Republic of China, I extend my warm congratulations to you, Ambassador, and through you to the Polish people and the government of the People's Republic of Poland.

In the ten years since liberation, under the leadership of the Polish United Workers' Party and its long-tested leader Comrade Bierut, and with the strong assistance of the Soviet Union, the Polish people have achieved great success in the country's socialist industrialization and the consolidation of the people's democratic system. People's Poland has transformed from a country severely damaged by war into an advanced people's democratic country with a high level of industrial development, and is currently striving along the road of socialist construction and for the further development of agriculture and light industry to improve the people's living standards.

People's Poland has unswervingly pursued a policy of international peace and friendship. Poland's representatives' unremitting efforts in the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Supervisory Commission in Korea have made important contributions to the implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement and the consolidation of peace in the Far East and the world. Now that an agreement has been reached on the issue of ceasefire and restoration of peace in Indochina, we believe that Poland, together with India and Canada, will make greater contributions to supervising the implementation of the ceasefire agreement and consolidating peace in the Far East and the world in the International Supervisory Commission.

Over the past four years, the friendship and cooperation between the Chinese and Polish peoples have greatly developed. We have achieved significant results in trade, shipping, cultural exchange, and technical cooperation. There is no doubt that the friendly cooperation between the Chinese and Polish peoples will be increasingly strengthened and consolidated on the existing foundation.

Let us:

	For the growing development and consolidation of friendship between China and Poland!
	For the good health of Comrade Bierut, the beloved leader of the Polish people!
	For the growing strength of the world's peace, democracy, and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!

    今天是波兰人民共和国第十周年国庆纪念日，我代表中国人民和中华人民共和国政府向您、大使同志，并通过您向波兰人民和波兰人民共和国政府谨致热烈的祝贺。
    波兰人民在解放后的十年中在波兰统一工人党和久经考验的领袖贝鲁特同志的领导下，在苏联的大力援助下，在国家社会主义工业化和巩固人民民主制度方面获得了巨大的成就。人民的波兰已经从一个遭受了战争严重破坏的国家变成一个具有高度工业发展的先进的人民民主国家，目前正在沿着社会主义建设的道路并为进一步发展农业、轻工业以提高人民的生活水平而奋斗。
    人民波兰坚持不渝地奉行着国际和平与友好的政策。波兰代表在朝鲜中立国遣返委员会和监察委员会中所进行的不懈努力，对朝鲜停战协定的实施、巩固远东和全世界的和平作了重要的贡献。现在印度支那停战和恢复和平问题已经达成协议，我们相信波兰将与印度、加拿大在国际监察委员会中，为监督停战协议的实施、巩固远东和世界和平作出更大的贡献。
    四年多来，中波两国人民的友谊与合作有了很大的发展。我们在贸易、海运、文化交流、技术合作等方面已经取得了重大的成绩。毫无疑问，中波两国人民的友好合作将在已有的基础上日益加强和巩固。
    让我们：为中波两国间的友谊日益发展与巩固为波兰人民敬爱的领袖贝鲁特同志身体健康为以苏联为首的世界和平民主社会主义阵营的日益
  强大而干杯！
