    Shanxi Province Supply and Marketing Cooperatives
    Vigorously Support Farmers in Raising Pigs
    Supply and marketing cooperatives in various parts of Shanxi Province are vigorously supporting farmers in raising pigs. According to incomplete statistics from Pingyao, Jishan, Pinglu, Lishi, Pingshun, Yuci, Pingding and other counties, as of mid-June, they have supplied farmers with more than 140,000 jin of raw materials for flour mills and millstones, more than 160,000 jin of soybean cakes, more than 260,000 jin of rice bran, and have purchased more than 700 piglets for farmers. The Jishan County Supply and Marketing Cooperative has formulated a long-term plan to support farmers in raising pigs. The Lujiakou Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Pingshun County supplied farmers with more than 50 sows, and it is estimated that more than 400 piglets can be bred by the end of this year. In Tuofang in Tunliu County, Zhangqing in Yuci County, and other places, many grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives have signed pig raising contracts and contracts for ordering live pigs with agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and individual farmers. With the active support of supply and marketing cooperatives in various places, the enthusiasm of the vast number of farmers in raising pigs is very high. Farmers in Waling Township, Pinglu County, who had not raised pigs for several years, have raised 73 pigs this year and are preparing to sell the fattened pigs to the state.

    山西省各地供销合作社大力扶植农民养猪。据平遥、稷山、平陆、离石、平顺、榆次、平定等县的不完全统计，截至六月中旬止，已供应给农民粉坊、磨坊原料十四万多斤，豆饼十六万多斤，谷糠二十六万多斤，并且为农民采购了七百多个猪仔。稷山县供销合作社订出常年扶植农民养猪的计划。平顺县路家口供销合作社供给农民五十多口母猪，估计到今年年底可繁殖四百多个小猪。屯留县驼坊、榆次县张庆等地不少基层供销合作社和农业生产合作社、互助组及个体农民签订了养猪合同及订购毛猪的合同。在各地供销合作社积极扶植下，广大农民的养猪积极性很高。几年来都没有养猪的平陆县瓦岭乡的农民，今年也养了七十三口猪，并准备把猪养肥后卖给国家。
