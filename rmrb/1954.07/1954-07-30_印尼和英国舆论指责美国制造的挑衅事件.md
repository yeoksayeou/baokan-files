Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, July 29th: Political observers here expressed great surprise at the United States' dispatch of an aircraft carrier to the South China Sea and its attack on Chinese aircraft. On the 28th, they told the "People's Daily" reporter in Indonesia that this proves the United States is unwilling to see peace achieved in Indochina and is creating conditions for organizing its Southeast Asian war pact. They pointed out that the American provocation is reminiscent of Japan's launching of an attack on Manchuria under the pretext of searching for a murdered Japanese officer. However, they emphasized that no Asian country, including Japan, wants to see armed conflict in the Far East at present.

Political observers told reporters from "Indonesian News" that the actions of the United States can only be understood as an attempt to obstruct the first steps towards achieving peace in Indochina and Korea. They pointed out that the presence of the US Navy near Hainan Island at this time shows that the US shooting down of People's Republic of China aircraft was fully prepared in advance to restore tensions in Asia. They believe it is difficult to accept the US claim that Chinese aircraft attacked US aircraft first, because the People's Republic of China has expressed regret and is prepared to compensate for the losses caused by the British aircraft incident.

"Indonesian News" published a commentary on the 28th stating that the honest and frank attitude of the People's Republic of China has satisfied the United Kingdom. It is very inappropriate for the United States to send warships to the vicinity of Chinese waters.

Xinhua News Agency, July 29th: According to TASS, London, July 28th: Most British local newspapers' foreign affairs observers and editorials have accused American fighter planes of provocatively attacking aircraft of the People's Republic of China.

The foreign affairs reporter for the "Birmingham Post" pointed out: The attack by American aircraft on Chinese aircraft has made a bad situation worse; London officials believe that the Air King aircraft (an aircraft mistaken for a Chinese aircraft and shot down) incident is almost completely settled.

The reporter added: "The US patrol plane's search was conducted after the Hong Kong authorities had already abandoned all hope of finding any survivors. The Chinese may regard this as a provocation... Whitehall (the seat of the British government) will certainly not underestimate the importance of these events, but it also hopes that these events will not be expanded into a major international incident."

The "Yorkshire Post" editorial acknowledged that the People's Republic of China government's statement regarding the sabotage activities of the Chiang Kai-shek clique is well-founded. In this regard, the newspaper emphasized: "Chiang Kai-shek still receives strong support from important groups in the United States... One thing is certain, in this region of very high tension between East and West, the existence of the Taiwan regime is a very dangerous and long-term factor."

The newspaper compared the policies of the People's Republic of China, the United Kingdom, and the United States, and concluded: "At a time when the Beijing government is clearly seeking to improve relations with the West, and when the United Kingdom's recognition of China helps to comprehensively normalize international relations, the United States' policy in Taiwan is governed by an opposite spirit: it refuses to recognize Beijing, and it continues to support Taiwan."

The "Manchester Guardian" called in an editorial for "efforts to ease tensions in East Asia." The newspaper also emphasized that the situation cannot be eased if the Chiang Kai-shek clique is incited to attack the mainland, or if the United States is constantly looking to provoke China.

### 印尼和英国舆论指责美国制造的挑衅事件

    印尼和英国舆论指责美国制造的挑衅事件
    【新华社雅加达二十九日电】这里的政治观察家们对于美国派遣航空母舰前往南中国海并攻击中国飞机表示非常惊讶，他们在二十八日向印尼“人民日报”记者说，这证明美国不愿看到印度支那实现和平，并且正在为组织它的东南亚战争公约创造条件。他们指出，美国的挑衅使人回想起日本借口寻找被杀死的日本军官而向满洲发动进攻的事情。但是他们强调说，目前任何亚洲国家，包括日本在内，都不愿看到远东发生武装冲突。
    政治观察家们向“印尼新闻”的记者说，美国的所作所为只能被理解为图谋阻挠在印度支那和朝鲜实现和平的第一步。他们指出，美国海军在这个时候在海南岛附近游弋说明：美国击落中华人民共和国飞机，是事先就已经充分准备好，以恢复亚洲紧张局势的。他们认为很难接受美国所谓中国飞机首先攻击美国飞机的说法，因为中华人民共和国已表示遗憾并准备赔偿英国飞机事件所造成的损失。
    “印尼新闻”二十八日发表评论说，中华人民共和国的诚实而坦白的态度已使英国感到满意。美国派遣军舰前往中国海面附近是非常不适宜的。
      【新华社二十九日讯】据塔斯社伦敦二十八日讯：大多数英国地方报纸的外交观察家和社论都指责美国战斗机对中华人民共和国飞机的挑衅性攻击。
      “伯明翰邮报”的外交记者指出：美国飞机对中国飞机的攻击使得坏形势更加坏了；伦敦官方人士认为空中霸王式飞机（一架被中国飞机认错了而打下来的飞机）事件已经差不多完全了结了。
    记者又说：“美国巡逻机进行搜寻是在香港当局早已放弃了再找到任何幸存者的一切希望以后，中国人可能认为这是挑衅……。白厅（英国政府所在地）是一定不会低估这些事件的重要性的，但它也希望不要把这些事件扩大成为一个大的国际事件。”
      “约克郡邮报”的社论承认，中华人民共和国政府关于蒋介石集团的破坏活动的声明是有充分根据的。在这方面，报纸着重指出：“蒋介石仍然得到美国重要集团的大力支持……有一件事情是肯定的，在这个东西方关系非常紧张的地区，台湾政权的存在是一个非常危险的、长期的因素。”
    这家报纸把中华人民共和国、英国和美国的政策作了比较，并得出结论说：“在北京政府显然要改善同西方的关系的时候，在英国对中国的承认有助于国际关系全面正常化的时候，美国在台湾的政策是受一种相反的精神支配的：它拒绝承认北京，它继续支持台湾。”
      “曼彻斯特卫报”在社论中要求“设法缓和东亚紧张局势”。这家报纸同时着重指出，如果蒋介石集团受到唆使要袭击大陆的话，如果美国随时想向中国挑衅的话，局势是不可能缓和的。
