The Geneva Conference reached an agreement on the cessation of hostilities and restoration of peace in Indochina. This is the first time that the People's Republic of China, as a world power, has used a peaceful diplomatic policy to jointly consult with the four major powers to resolve pressing Asian issues, marking a great victory in easing world tensions.

The end of the eight-year Indochina War not only meets the urgent demands of the people of Indochina and the people of France, but also meets the common aspirations of all the people of China and all peace-loving people in the world. Therefore, the agreements reached at the Geneva Conference will surely receive the support of people from all countries in the world, especially the people of Asian countries. We fully endorse Premier Zhou Enlai's speech at the Geneva Conference on July 21, and fully agree with and support these agreements, because these agreements stipulate the principles for resolving the Indochina armistice and political issues. According to these principles, the three Indochinese countries will achieve independence, democracy, unity, and territorial integrity, and the people of the three countries will be able to engage in national construction and live free and happy lives in a peaceful environment.

The conclusion of the Indochina armistice agreement once again proves that peace can defeat war and that consultation can resolve international disputes. Through this Geneva Conference and the recent joint statements between China and India, and China and Burma, more and more countries in the world are in favor of peaceful coexistence. The path of resolving international disputes through war has become impassable, and only through consultation is the broad road to resolving international disputes. The US ruling clique's attempt to undermine the Geneva peace negotiations, to cobble together a Southeast Asia aggressive bloc, and to use Asians to fight Asians, has been shamefully defeated. It has fallen into an unprecedentedly isolated position in the international arena.

The People's Republic of China, from the day of its founding, has declared to the world that the principle of our country's foreign policy is to safeguard the integrity of our national independence, freedom, and territorial sovereignty. The Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China, promulgated on June 15, 1954, further stipulates that our country establishes diplomatic relations with any country and develops them on the basis of the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect for territorial sovereignty. In international affairs, our country's unwavering policy is to strive for the noble cause of world peace and human progress. However, the US imperialists continue to occupy our Taiwan and collude with the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to carry out restoration conspiracy activities, openly antagonizing the 600 million Chinese people. The Chinese people who have stood up will never tolerate US imperialism's long-term occupation of our territory and undermining of our sovereignty. For the sake of national unity and construction, and for the sake of safeguarding peace in Asia and the world, the Chinese people must liberate Taiwan.

The Chinese delegation, headed by Premier Zhou Enlai, based on the consistent peaceful foreign policy of the Central People's Government, united with the delegations of the Soviet Union, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam at the Geneva Conference, and actively consulted with the British and French delegations. Although no agreement was reached on the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue due to US sabotage, it made a significant contribution to promoting the Indochina armistice agreement, and won widespread praise from world opinion, making our country's status as a major power universally recognized. In particular, the agreement stipulates that the three Indochinese countries will not participate in any military alliances and will not allow any foreign countries to establish military bases on their territories. This is a heavy blow to the US ruling clique and has a great significance for our national defense security.

We are infinitely delighted and encouraged by the efforts and achievements of our delegation at the Geneva Conference. We would like to pay our highest respects and express our heartfelt gratitude to Premier Zhou Enlai and all the comrades of the delegation! At the same time, we should be more vigilant, closely unite around the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, strive for the thorough implementation of the agreement, and continue to work for the lasting peace of Asia and the world.

    中国农工民主党副主席彭泽民的谈话
    日内瓦会议关于印度支那停战和恢复和平问题达成协议，这是中华人民共和国第一次以世界大国的身份，运用和平外交政策与四大国共同协商解决亚洲迫切问题，以缓和世界紧张局势的伟大胜利。
    经历八年的印度支那战争宣告结束，这不仅符合印度支那人民和法国人民的迫切要求，同时也符合全中国人民和全世界爱好和平人民的共同愿望。所以日内瓦会议所达成的协议，必将获得世界各国人民特别是亚洲各国人民的支持。我们完全拥护周恩来总理七月二十一日在日内瓦会议上的发言，完全同意并支持这些协议，因为这些协议规定了解决印度支那停战问题和政治问题的原则。根据这些原则，印度支那三国将获得独立、民主、统一和领土完整，三国人民将能够在和平的环境中从事国家的建设，过自由幸福的生活。
    印度支那停战协议的达成，又一次证明了和平可以战胜战争，协商可以解决国际争端。通过这次日内瓦会议和最近中印、中缅的联合声明，世界上赞成和平共处的国家越来越多。用战争来解决国际争端这条路已经走不通了，只有通过协商才是解决国际争端的康庄大道。美国统治集团企图破坏日内瓦和平协商，拼凑东南亚侵略集团，用亚洲人打亚洲人的阴谋诡计，已经遭到可耻的失败。它在国际上已陷于空前孤立的地位。
      中华人民共和国从成立的那一天起，就向全世界宣布：我国外交政策的原则，是保障本国独立、自由和领土主权的完整。一九五四年六月十五日公布的中华人民共和国宪法草案更规定：我国根据平等、互利、互相尊重领土主权的原则同任何国家建立和发展外交关系，在国际事务中，我国坚定不移的方针是为世界和平和人类进步的崇高目的而努力。但是美帝国主义者继续侵占我国台湾，并勾结蒋介石残余匪帮进行复辟阴谋活动，公开与六万万中国人民为敌。站起来了的中国人民决不能容忍美帝国主义长期侵占我国的领土，破坏我国的主权，中国人民为了国家的统一建设，为了保障亚洲及世界的和平，一定要解放台湾。
    以周恩来总理为首的我国代表团，本着中央人民政府一贯的和平外交政策，在日内瓦会议中和苏联、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、越南民主共和国代表团团结一致，主动和英、法代表团进行协商，虽然对和平解决朝鲜问题，因美国破坏没有达成任何协议，但对于促进印度支那停战协议，作出了巨大的贡献，获得了世界舆论广泛的赞扬，使我国的大国的地位为举世所公认。特别在协议中规定了印度支那三国将不参加任何军事同盟，不容许任何外国在它们的国土上建立军事基地，这对美国统治集团是一个沉重的打击，对我国国防安全具有重大的意义。
    我们对我国代表团在日内瓦会议的努力和成就，感到无限的欢欣鼓舞。我们谨向周恩来总理和代表团全体同志致以崇高的敬意，并表示衷心的感谢！同时我们当更加提高警惕，紧密团结在中国共产党和毛主席的周围，为争取协议的彻底实现、并继续为维护亚洲和世界的持久和平而努力。
