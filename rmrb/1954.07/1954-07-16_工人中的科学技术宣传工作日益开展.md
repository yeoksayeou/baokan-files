    In recent years, under the joint efforts of trade union organizations and science and technology popularization associations in various regions, scientific and technological propaganda among workers has been widely carried out.

    At present, in major cities across the country, many trade union organizations and science and technology popularization associations have jointly organized science and technology lectures and technical training courses for workers, attracting a large number of workers to attend. For example, the Dalian-Lushun Science and Technology Popularization Association has held systematic lectures on electricity, motors, electrical engineering, chemistry, industrial chemistry, mechanical mechanics, mechanical engineering, and so on for workers, with each lecture attracting a fixed audience of three hundred to more than one thousand workers. The workers call these lectures "social universities." The Shanghai Science and Technology Popularization Association and the Shanghai Metalworkers' Union jointly held a "Production Knowledge Lecture for Machine Manufacturing Plants" for more than one hundred enterprise management cadres from twenty state-owned machine manufacturing factories, helping them lay the foundation for in-depth business studies. Many cadres who were newly promoted from workers or transferred from local areas, after a year of study, listened to twenty-two lectures in seven units including basic principles of mechanical drawing, metal materials, casting, forging, metalworking, and heat treatment, improving their professional skills and being able to use this scientific knowledge to solve some practical problems in production. The Jiangsu Science and Technology Popularization Association and the Nanjing No. 1 District Mechanical Workers' Union held a "Technician Blueprint Reading Class" for lathe operators and fitters from more than ten private machine factories. After nine months of study, the students not only could construct according to the drawings but also learned the calculation of gears and tolerances, improving product quality. Wuhan promoted the "Speed Reading Blueprint Method" created by Professor Zhao Xuetian, a member of the Wuhan Science and Technology Popularization Association, which, with only twenty hours of lecturing, discussion, and practice, could enable an ordinary worker to understand machine part drawings and simple assembly drawings, quickly improving the technical level of workers.

    The Science and Technology Popularization Association has held regular systematic science and technology lectures and science exhibitions in workers' cultural palaces and workers' clubs in more than a dozen cities. This science propaganda activity has attracted a group of workers who come to listen regularly. The Beijing Science and Technology Popularization Association held systematic lectures on "Scientific Knowledge of Economic Construction" and "High-Speed Cutting Method" at the Beijing Working People's Cultural Palace. The latter lecture was attended by more than one hundred technicians of Grade 4 and above from twenty-five machine factories, repair factories, and iron factories.

    The Science and Technology Popularization Association has also established member work groups in many factories, cooperating with the factory's trade union to promote scientific knowledge to workers and popularize advanced production experience in spare time through technical learning classes, lectures, broadcasting, blackboard newspaper problem-solving, etc., focusing on the factory's production tasks. The Jiangxi Mechanical Factory Member Work Group of the Jiangxi Science and Technology Popularization Association, in close cooperation with the trade union, held "Diesel Engine Broadcasting," "Basic Knowledge Lectures on Steel and Iron," and "Arithmetic Speed Class" in the factory, and technical learning classes on lathe operation, fitting, and repair outside the factory. In 1953 alone, they gave 192 science and technology lectures. The Taili Machine Factory Member Work Group of the Shanghai Science and Technology Popularization Association regularly holds systematic science and technology lectures for workers in the factory. They once launched a "Technical Lecture on Manufacturing Lathes" in response to the situation where the factory was converted to produce lathes and the management personnel and workers at all levels were unfamiliar with the new product specifications and had concerns about the production tasks. It played a significant role in completing the factory's production tasks. The Taili Work Group also joined forces with the Communist Youth League branch to organize a "Production Knowledge Learning Class" for all the factory's youth apprentices, helping the factory train technical workers.

    Members of the Science and Technology Popularization Association are very enthusiastic about participating in propaganda work for workers. They all make full preparations before giving lectures. For example, members of the Shanghai Science and Technology Popularization Association, who were in charge of the "Production Knowledge Lecture for Machine Manufacturing Plants," used their spare time to collect Soviet materials and practical information in production, wrote tens of thousands of words of lecture notes tailored to the needs of students' work, and added illustrations. Before the formal lecture, they also conducted trial lectures and designed models and charts as auxiliary teaching tools in order to ensure the correctness and ease of understanding of the lecture content. When the Tianjin Science and Technology Popularization Association held systematic lectures on astronomy, geography, biology, chemistry, and physics at the Workers' Cultural Palace, the professors from Nankai University and Hebei Normal College who were in charge of these lectures collectively discussed and studied the topic selection plan or lecture outline to ensure the quality of the lectures.

    工人中的科学技术宣传工作日益开展
    近几年来，在各地工会组织和科学技术普及协会的共同努力下，在工人群众中的科学技术宣传工作有了广泛的开展。
    目前，在全国各大城市，不少工会组织和科学技术普及协会联合举办了工人科学技术讲座和技术训练班，吸收大批工人群众听讲。如旅大市科学技术普及协会为工人群众先后举办了电学、电机、电工、化学、工业化学、机械力学、机械工程等等的系统讲座，每一讲座吸收固定听众三百到一千多工人。工人把这些讲座叫作社会大学。上海市科学技术普及协会和上海市五金工会联合为二十个国营机器制造业工厂的一百多个企业管理干部举办“机器制造厂生产知识讲座”，帮助他们打下钻研业务的基础。许多新由工人提升或由地方转来的干部，经过一年的学习，听了机械制图基本原理、金属材料、铸工、锻工、金工、热处理等七个单元二十二次讲演以后，提高了业务水平，并能运用这些科学知识解决一些生产上的实际问题。江苏省科学技术普及协会曾和南京市一区机械工会为十多家私营机器厂的车工、钳工举办“技工读图班”。经过九个月的学习，学员不仅能按图样施工，而且学会了齿轮和公差的计算，提高了产品质量。武汉市推行了武汉市科学技术普及协会会员赵学田教授创造的“速成看图法”，只要二十个小时的讲授、讨论和练习，就可使一个普通工人看懂机件零件图和简单的装配图，迅速地提高了工人的技术水平。
    科学技术普及协会在十几个城市的工人文化宫、工人俱乐部举办了经常性的系统科学技术讲座和科学展览会。这项科学宣传活动吸引了一批工人，他们按期自动地来听讲。北京市科学技术普及协会在北京劳动人民文化宫举办了“经济建设科学知识”和“高速切削法”等系统讲座。后一讲座有二十五个机器厂、修理厂和铁工厂的四级以上技术工人一百多人听讲。
    科学技术普及协会又在很多工厂建立了会员工作组，和本厂的工会合作，围绕厂内的生产任务，在业余时间通过技术学习班、讲座、广播、黑板报问题解答等方式向工人宣传科学知识和推广先进生产经验。江西省科学技术普及协会江西机械厂会员工作组在和工会密切合作下，在厂内曾举办“柴油发动机广播”、“钢和铁基本常识讲座”、“算术速成班”，在厂外举办了车工、钳工、修理等技术学习班，在一九五三年一年内作了一百九十二次科学技术讲演。上海市科学技术普及协会泰利机器厂会员工作组，常年地为厂内工人举办系统科学技术讲座。他们曾针对工厂转为生产车床，各级管理人员和工人对新产品规格不熟悉，对生产任务有顾虑的情况，开办了“制造车床技术讲座”，对该厂完成生产任务起了重大作用。泰利工作组还和青年团支部联合举办了全厂青年习艺生的“生产知识学习班”，帮助工厂培养技术工人。
    科学技术普及协会会员都非常热情地参加对工人的宣传工作。他们在讲演前，大都作了充分的准备。如担任“机器制造厂生产知识讲座”的上海科学技术普及协会的会员，利用业余时间搜集苏联资料和生产中的实际情况，针对学员工作上的需要，编写上万字的讲义，并配上插图。在正式讲演前，还进行了试讲，设计了模型、图表，作为辅助教学工具，以求讲演内容的正确和通俗易懂。天津市科学技术普及协会在工人文化宫举办天文、地理、生物、化学、物理等系统讲座时，担任这些讲座的南开大学和河北师范学院的教授，都集体讨论和研究了选题计划或讲演提纲，保证了讲座的质量。
