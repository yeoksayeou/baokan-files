Xinhua News Agency, July 23rd -- TASS, London, July 22nd: According to the British United Press, British Foreign Secretary Eden told reporters at London Airport upon his arrival by plane from Geneva on the 21st: "We had a twofold task to accomplish. First, to try to reach an agreement on a solution to the long and unpleasant war in Indochina, and second, to try to avoid the danger of expanding the war with such a solution. I think the Geneva Conference has successfully accomplished both of these tasks."

A reporter asked if the obvious achievements of the Geneva negotiations would lead to further peace talks. Eden replied: "This should help to ease tensions to some extent. I hope things will be like this, and I believe they will be."

Xinhua News Agency, July 23rd -- According to the Indian News Service on the 22nd, Nepalese Foreign Minister Regmi said that everyone would welcome the agreement to cease hostilities in Indochina. He said, "We hope that this ceasefire will not only be the beginning of an era of peace in Asia, but also the beginning of an era of peace throughout the world."
