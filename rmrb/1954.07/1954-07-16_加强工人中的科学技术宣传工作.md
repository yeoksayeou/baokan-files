    Strengthen Scientific and Technological Publicity Work Among Workers

    In the period of national socialist industrialization, improving the scientific and technological level of workers is an important political task. To accomplish this task, in addition to formal or informal technical education, it is necessary to widely mobilize scientific and technological workers to actively carry out mass scientific and technological publicity work.

    In the past few years, trade union organizations and science and technology popularization associations have made great efforts in mobilizing and organizing factory and mine technical personnel and scientific and technological workers to participate in scientific and technological publicity, and have achieved certain results. However, the propaganda departments of trade union organizations in various regions have not yet regarded this work as an important part of their daily work; the science and technology popularization associations have also not raised this work to the position it deserves. Therefore, in scientific and technological publicity work, on the one hand, the mobilization of scientific and technological workers is not yet widespread enough to meet the growing needs of workers for learning scientific and technological knowledge; on the other hand, there are still shortcomings in the publicity work, such as theory being divorced from practice.

    In order to strengthen scientific and technological publicity work, trade union organizations and science and technology popularization associations should closely cooperate and work together in accordance with the joint instructions of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the All-China Association for Science and Technology Popularization. Trade union organizations must fully estimate the enthusiasm of scientific and technological personnel in carrying out scientific and technological publicity, and recognize that successfully organizing this work is a good way to unite technical personnel, combine technology and labor, and combine technical personnel and the masses of workers, helping the science and technology popularization association to mobilize and organize the masses of workers, understand the demands of the masses of workers, and at the same time strive to solve specific problems such as publicity venues and funding. The science and technology popularization association should widely mobilize its members, regard popularizing science and technology to workers as its important task, create various publicity materials suitable for workers' needs, actively create working conditions for members, improve the existing association member work groups in various factories and mines, and systematically summarize and promote the experience of factory and mine member work groups in carrying out publicity work.

    To realize the cooperation between trade unions and science and technology popularization associations and ensure the smooth development of mass scientific and technological publicity work, it is necessary to strengthen the Party's leadership over science popularization work. The Party has always attached importance to science popularization work, and has carried out publicity of scientific knowledge to workers, peasants, and soldiers even in the difficult environments of the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the All-China Association for Science and Technology Popularization was established under the care and leadership of the Party to promote science popularization work. Last year, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China also issued instructions to the Party committees of various provinces and cities, pointing out that the Party organizations of various provinces and cities should strengthen their leadership over the work of the Science and Technology Popularization Association during the period of large-scale economic construction. Now the scientific and technological publicity work among the masses of workers must be carried out more organized and widely, which is of great significance for accelerating the country's socialist industrialization. The Party organizations in various places should pay attention to this work, and the Party organizations and administrative leaders of various factories and mines should pay more attention to and lead the scientific and technological publicity work within the factories and mines, and help the development of scientific and technological publicity work in all aspects.

### 加强工人中的科学技术宣传工作

    加强工人中的科学技术宣传工作
    在国家进行社会主义工业化的建设时期，提高工人的科学技术水平，乃是一项重要的政治任务。要完成这一任务，除了进行正规的或业余的技术教育以外，还应当广泛地动员科学技术工作者，积极开展群众性的科学技术宣传工作。
    过去几年，工会组织和科学技术普及协会，在动员和组织厂矿技术人员、科学技术工作者参加科学技术宣传方面作了很大的努力，并取得一定成绩。但各地工会组织的宣传部门，还没有把这一工作当作日常工作的重要项目；科学技术普及协会也还没有把这一工作提高到应有的地位。因此，在科学技术宣传工作中，一方面是科学技术工作者发动得还不很普遍，不能满足工人群众日益增长的学习科学技术知识的需要；另一方面，在宣传工作中也还存在着理论脱离实际的缺点。
    为了加强科学技术宣传工作，工会组织和科学技术普及协会应当根据中华全国总工会、中华全国科学技术普及协会关于加强科学技术宣传工作的联合指示，密切配合，共同努力。工会组织必须充分估计到科学技术人员在进行科学技术宣传上的积极性，并认识到成功地组织这一工作，乃是团结技术人员，使技术和劳动相结合，使技术人员和工人群众相结合的一个好方法，帮助科学技术普及协会动员和组织工人群众，了解工人群众的要求，同时努力解决宣传场所、经费等具体问题。科学技术普及协会应当广泛地发动会员，把向工人宣传科学技术作为自己的重要任务，创作各种适合工人要求的宣传资料，积极为会员创造工作条件，健全现有各厂矿企业中的协会会员工作组，并系统地总结和推广厂矿会员工作组进行宣传工作的经验。
    要实现工会和科学技术普及协会之间的合作，并保证群众性的科学技术宣传工作的顺利开展，必须加强党对科学普及工作的领导。党向来是重视科学普及工作的，在抗日战争和解放战争的艰苦环境下，还向工农兵群众进行了科学知识的宣传。中华人民共和国成立后，就在党的关怀和领导下，建立了中华全国科学技术普及协会以推动科学普及工作。去年中共中央还向各省市党委发布了指示，指出在大规模经济建设时期中，各省市的党组织应加强对科学技术普及协会工作的领导。现在在工人群众中的科学技术宣传工作就要更有组织地广泛展开，这对于加速国家的社会主义工业化有重大意义，各地党组织应该对这一工作予以重视，各厂矿的党组织和行政领导方面更应当关心和领导厂矿内的科学技术宣传工作，从各个方面来帮助科学技术宣传工作的开展。
