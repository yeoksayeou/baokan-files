    A Record of Attending the Pingjiang County First People's Congress First Session Discussion on the Draft Constitution

    On July 1st, more than 300 representatives attending the Pingjiang County People's Congress meeting in Hunan Province discussed the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China in groups. Holding the "Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China" pamphlets they had just bought from bookstores, the representatives read it word by word and expressed their opinions enthusiastically.

    "Speaking of being masters of our own house, the working people are truly masters." Wu Dazhou, a farmer representative who participated in the Autumn Harvest Uprising in 1927, said with emotion: "Article 106 of the Draft Constitution suits the people's hearts in every way. I don't know where to begin. I'll just talk about one thing: the Constitution guarantees personal freedom." He pointed to his sunken nose and said: "This was damaged by the reactionaries. During the Great Revolution, I was arrested and beaten by the reactionaries seven times in two months. At that time, our crime was that we wanted democracy, freedom, and food to eat, but today these things are clearly written in the Draft Constitution."

    Su Jinshan, a veteran Red Army soldier who lost his right leg in revolutionary struggles, leaned on his crutches and recalled deeply, saying, "Comrades, the fruits of the revolution did not come easily. The Draft Constitution was written with the blood of revolutionary martyrs. Although my body is disabled, my heart is not. I must defend this victorious fruit and strive to implement it, leading the peasants forward on the socialist road!"

    At this time, the majestic song "Resolute Hard Fight," which was popular among the soldiers of the 16th Red Army Division, resounded in another group meeting. Everyone asked Fang Sizu, a veteran Red Army soldier, to sing a few more songs to welcome the promulgation of the Draft Constitution. Fang Sizu sang three or four songs in a row. He said, "The people in the old revolutionary base area of ​​Huangjindong were very happy when they heard the news of the promulgation of the Draft Constitution. People who hadn't sung for many years started singing."

    "Take me, for example!" At this time, a trace of a smile appeared on Fang Sizu's face, "In the past, the reactionaries called me a 'bandit,' but now the people have elected me as the township head and county people's representative, and I have even met Chairman Mao in Beijing. I have food and clothing at home, and my children are in middle school. At night, I lie in bed thinking over and over again, and the more I think about it, the happier I get."

    His words aroused the thoughts of many people. Everyone scrambled to speak.

    Huang Jifang, a people's representative from Gujiadong, started from the story of changing the name of his hometown to talk about his feelings. He said: After liberation, the government helped us rebuild our homes from the ruins, and every mountain gully has changed its appearance. This 50-plus-mile-long mountain gully was burned and killed by the reactionaries for seven or eight years, and there were no people living there. Since the People's Government established two paper mills here, it has enabled us to increase our income by two or three hundred catties of rice per person per year. Many new phenomena have emerged in the township: there are more new houses being built, more new clothes being worn, more wedding celebrations, and also more pens and flashlights. Mobile medical teams, film projection teams, and mobile schools also frequently come to the mountain gullies, and supply and marketing cooperatives deliver goods to our doorsteps. The villagers often say: Follow the Communist Party, the more we go, the happier we are. Because the peasants feel that there are many new atmospheres of "renewal" in the mountain gullies in recent years, they have already requested the approval of the higher-level leading organs to rename Gujiadong as "Huanxin Township."

    During the discussion, the representatives were very interested in the provisions of Articles 7 and 8 of the Draft Constitution that "the state protects the property of cooperatives, encourages, guides, and helps the development of the cooperative economy." Wu Jinxuan, a model special-class family member of a martyr, cited their Shangenxi Township as an example. He said, "The government has helped 70 percent of the farmers in our township to organize. All 96 families of martyrs, military personnel, and workers have joined mutual aid groups. Most of the barren oil tea forests have been restored. Last year, the output of tea oil increased eight times compared with before liberation. This year, we sold more than 40,000 catties of tea oil to the state, and everyone's lives have improved. Now we are reclaiming 1,500 mu of tea mountain and strive to sell 60,000 catties of tea oil to the state next year to support national industrial construction." Wu Ming'an, the director of the Xinxin Agricultural Production Cooperative in Anding Township, also introduced the growth process of their cooperative under the guidance and help of the government. He said, "In 1952, our mutual aid group achieved a bumper harvest of 681 catties per mu. Last year, our yield per mu increased to more than 700 catties, and a high yield of '1,000 catties per mu' also appeared in the mountainous area. This year, we have transformed into an agricultural production cooperative and expanded the area of double-cropping rice. We have prepaid 12,000 catties of rice to the state. Now another 50 peasant households are asking to join the cooperative. Everyone is asking to take the socialist road."

    Many people's representatives said that they would organize the masses to discuss the Draft Constitution when they returned to their villages and use the practical actions of striving for a bumper harvest of food crops to support the promulgation of the Draft Constitution. Wang Zhengying (female), a model family member of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the vice-chairman of the Xinmin Agricultural Production Cooperative, introduced the emulation conditions she proposed to her husband on the Korean front to welcome the promulgation of the Draft Constitution and build the socialist motherland. She guaranteed to help all 47 mutual aid groups in the township consolidate and improve, overcome the current mountain flood disasters, and strive for a bumper harvest of rice. Jiayi Township, the site of the "Pingjiang Massacre" created by the Kuomintang reactionaries in 1939, was rated as a model high-yield township in the county the year before last. Yang Xianran, the people's representative of this township, said, "We must carry forward the revolutionary tradition and strive for greater glory. After returning, we will organize the masses to discuss the Draft Constitution, consolidate the 35 mutual aid groups in the township, and prepare for the establishment of five agricultural production cooperatives after the autumn harvest, so that the flowers of socialism will bloom in the places where the blood of the martyrs has been shed."

    平江县第一届第一次人民代表大会会议讨论宪法草案旁听记
    新华社记者  胡坚
    “七一”这天，参加湖南省平江县人民代表大会会议的三百多名代表分组讨论了中华人民共和国宪法草案。代表们拿着他们刚从书店买来的中华人民共和国宪法草案单行本，一字一句地念着，热烈地发表着自己的意见。
    “说当家，劳动人民真是当了家。”曾参加过一九二七年秋收起义的农民代表吴达周感慨地说：“宪法草案一百零六条，条条都合人民的心意，我不晓得从何说起，我只谈一桩事情，宪法保障人身自由。”他指着自己的陷鼻孔说：“这是反动派打坏的。在大革命时，我两个月中就给反动派抓去毒打过七次。那时我们的罪名就是因为要民主、要自由、要有饭吃，可是今天却把这些事明明白白地写在宪法草案上了。”
    一位在革命斗争中失去右腿的红军老战士苏金胜，伏在拐杖上深沉地回忆着，他说：“同志们，革命的果实来得不容易，宪法草案是革命先烈们的鲜血写成的。我人残废心不残废，我一定要保卫这个胜利果实，并且努力执行，带着农民向社会主义大道前进！”
    这时，在另一个小组会上响起了当年在红十六师战士中流行的“坚强苦战”的雄壮的歌声。大家都要求红军老战士方思祖多唱几首歌来欢迎宪法草案的公布。方思祖一连唱了三四首歌。他说：“我们黄金洞革命老根据地的人民听到宪法草案公布的消息，都很高兴，多少年不曾唱歌的人都唱起来了。”
    “拿我说吧！”这时方思祖脸上泛起一丝丝的笑容，“过去反动派叫我‘土匪’，现在人民选我当乡长和县人民代表，还到北京见过毛主席。家里有吃有穿，我的孩子还上了中学。晚上我睡在床上翻来覆去地想，越想越高兴。”
    他的话，引起了许多人的心事。大家都抢着发言。
    辜家洞的人民代表黄继芳从本乡改变乡名的故事谈起他的感想，他说：解放以后，政府帮助我们从废墟上重建了家园，条条山沟都变了样。我们这条五十多里长的山沟，曾被反动派烧杀得七八年没有人烟，自从人民政府在这里建立两个造纸厂以后，使我们每人每年能增加两三百斤稻谷的收入，乡里出现许多新气象：盖新房的多，穿新衣的多，结婚喜事多，还有钢笔和手电筒多。巡回医疗队、电影队和巡回学校也时常到山沟里来，供销合作社把货物送上门。老乡们嘴边时常念着：跟着共产党走，越走越幸福。农民们因为感到这几年山沟里“焕然一新”的新气象很多，已经请求上级领导机关批准把辜家洞改名为“焕新乡”了。
    在讨论中，代表们对宪法草案第七条和第八条中规定的“国家保护合作社的财产，鼓励、指导和帮助合作社经济的发展”，感到很大兴趣。特等烈属模范吴金轩举出他们上恩溪乡作例子，他说：“政府帮助我们全乡百分之七十的农民组织起来了，全乡九十六户烈属军属和工属全部参加了互助组，荒芜的油茶林大部恢复起来，去年茶油产量比解放前增加八倍，今年我们卖给国家四万多斤茶油，大家生活都好了。现在我们正开垦一千五百亩茶山，争取明年卖给国家六万斤茶油，支援国家工业建设。”安定乡新新农业生产合作社社长吴命安还介绍了他们合作社在政府指导和帮助下的成长经过，他说：“一九五二年我们互助组每亩获得六百八十一斤的丰收产量，去年我们每亩产量提高到七百多斤，还在山区里出现了一亩‘千斤亩’的高产量。今年我们转为农业生产合作社，扩大了双季稻面积，预售给国家的稻谷就有一万二千斤。现在又有五十户农民要求入社，人人都要求走社会主义的大道。”
    许多人民代表都表示回到乡里要组织群众讨论宪法草案，用争取粮食作物丰收的实际行动来拥护宪法草案的公布。中国人民志愿军模范家属、新民农业生产合作社副社长王正英（女）当场介绍了她向在朝鲜前线的丈夫提出的为欢迎宪法草案公布、为建设社会主义祖国的立功竞赛条件，她保证帮助全乡四十七个互助组巩固提高，战胜目前的山洪灾害，争取水稻丰收。一九三九年国民党反动派制造的“平江惨案”发生地——嘉义乡，前年就被评为全县的丰产模范乡。这个乡的人民代表杨显然说：“我们一定要发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣，回去后组织群众讨论宪法草案，巩固全乡三十五个互助组，做好秋收后建立五个农业生产合作社的准备工作，让社会主义的鲜花在烈士们鲜血洒过的地方开放。”
