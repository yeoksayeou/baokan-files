Various Regions Strengthen Field Management to Strive for a Bumper Harvest of Coarse Grains

[By this paper’s dispatch] Corn, millet, sorghum, and other crops in the areas north of the Yangtze River and Yellow River, as well as the Northeast, are generally growing vigorously. Farmers in various regions are intensely engaged in field management work such as summer weeding and seedling protection. In the Northeast provinces, the first cultivation of field crops has concluded, and the second cultivation is now underway. Individual cooperatives and teams have also begun thinning seedlings and applying additional fertilizer. The thinning of seedlings and the first weeding of coarse grain crops along the Yellow River were completed before the wheat harvest. In Hebei and Henan, sorghum seedlings are already over a foot tall. In Inner Mongolia, sorghum, naked oats, flax, and other crops have also been weeded once. Replanted crops in various regions have also emerged from the soil. In most parts of Shandong Province, spring seedlings were weeded twice before the wheat harvest, and in the Lunan area, three weedings have been completed. In Sichuan Province, 18 million mu of corn and tens of thousands of mu of sorghum have been weeded and fertilized once, with stalks generally two to three feet tall; some of the earlier-sown corn has already formed ears and is filling out with grain. Recently, farmers in various regions have been seizing the opportunity to replant missing seedlings in farmland, and Hebei, Henan, Shandong, and other places have basically achieved full stands.

This year's spring plowing and sowing ended early, and the summer weeding work was arranged promptly in various regions, so the mid-cultivation and harrowing also started early. In Songjiang Province, advanced cooperatives and teams generally began harrowing successively around May 20th, ten days earlier than in previous years. Field operations have also improved compared with previous years. Many regions have achieved timely harrowing, careful harrowing, and a combination of harrowing and weeding. In more than ten counties in southern Sichuan, such as Xichong, 60% of the corn has been appropriately densely planted. Farmers in various regions are now actively learning or have already begun using artificial pollination methods for corn to ensure full ear formation and guarantee increased production.

    各地加强田间管理争取杂粮丰收
    【本报讯】长江、黄河以北及东北等地的玉米、谷子、高粱等作物，目前普遍生长茁壮，各地农民正紧张地投入夏锄、保苗等田间管理工作。东北各省大田作物头遍铲趟已结束，现正开铲二遍，个别社、组并开始间苗、追肥。黄河两岸杂粮作物的间苗和第一次锄草在麦收前已经完成。河北、河南高粱苗已一尺多高。内蒙高粱、莜麦、胡麻等也已锄过一遍，各地改种补种作物也已出土。山东省大部地区春苗在麦收前已锄过两遍，鲁南地区已锄完三遍。四川省一千八百万亩玉米和几万亩高粱已除草和追施肥料一次，株秆一般二、三尺高；部分播种较早的玉米已结苞饱粒。最近各地农民均抓紧时机，进行缺苗农田的补苗工作，河北、河南、山东等地已基本上达到全苗。
    今年春耕播种结束早，各地夏锄工作布置及时，因而中耕铲趟开始也早。松江省一般先进社、组五月二十日前后相继开铲，较往年提早十天，且田间作业较往年有所提高，很多地区作到及时铲趟，细铲细趟，铲趟结合。四川省南部、西充等十多个县有百分之六十的玉米进行了适当密植，现各地农民正积极学习或已进行玉米人工授粉方法，使玉米充分结实，保证增产。
