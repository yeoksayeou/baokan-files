The plan stipulates that the steps for abolishing the greater administrative region organizations and merging provinces should adhere to the principles of easy before difficult, simple before complex, and merging before abolishing, based on different work tasks and situations, and should be gradually handed over and abolished in a planned and step-by-step manner. New provinces will be established on August 1st, announcing the establishment of Liaoning Province and the new Heilongjiang Province, while changing all centrally-administered municipalities into province-administered municipalities; the administrative structure of Liaodong Province, Liaoxi Province, and Songjiang Province will be abolished; the Northeast Administrative Committee is scheduled to announce its abolition on August 15th.

Everyone unanimously believed in their speeches that the Central People's Government's decision to abolish greater administrative region organizations and merge several provinces and municipalities in the period when the country is entering a planned economic construction, in order to further strengthen the centralized and unified leadership of the Central Government, is completely correct and timely. In addition to fully supporting it, they expressed their firm determination to implement it and ensure the smooth completion of the handover work.
    Lin Feng delivered a concluding speech at the end of the meeting. He first pointed out that in order to correctly implement the Central Government's decision, all units at the Northeast level and the relevant provincial people's governments must make full preparations, do in-depth mobilization work and meticulous organizational work, and earnestly ensure good handover, good reception, good cleanup, and good arrangements. Regarding the work of the Northeast governments at all levels in the future, Lin Feng pointed out that the People's Government is an organ that serves the people and must pay attention to promoting a democratic style and maintaining close ties with the people. To this end: First, it is necessary to attach importance to the People's Congress, a national institution, hold meetings of the People's Congresses and government committees at all levels on schedule, fully promote democracy, better concentrate the wisdom of the masses, give play to the role of collective leadership, implement division of labor and responsibility, and give play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the staff. Secondly, it is also necessary to conscientiously carry out criticism and self-criticism, especially bottom-up criticism, develop the habit of criticism and self-criticism, always maintain a humble and cautious attitude, avoid arrogance, listen to criticism, and learn more from the opinions and experiences of others and other places. At the same time, it is necessary to have a good grasp of the principles of democratic centralism and strengthen organization and discipline.
    Regarding the work in the second half of this year, Lin Feng put forward essential opinions on industrial production, capital construction, rural work, commercial work, political and legal work, cultural and educational work, and other aspects in his speech. Finally, Lin Feng emphasized that all levels of government must thoroughly discuss and publicize the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China, improve the ideological and policy level of cadres, and improve the enthusiasm of the people. Governments at all levels must organize and inspect this work well. (Xinhua News Agency)

    关于今年下半年的工作，林枫在发言中对工业生产、基本建设、农村工作、商业工作、政法工作、文教工作等方面都提出了扼要的意见。最后，林枫强调指出：各级机关必须深入地讨论和宣传中华人民共和国宪法草案，提高干部的思想和政策水平，提高人民群众的积极性，各级政府要很好地组织和检查这一工作。（新华社）
