Conducting a Technical Innovation Movement to Improve Production Efficiency

    A Technological Innovation Saves Over 10 Billion Yuan
    After the production capacity of the paper machine at the state-owned Tianjin Paper Mill was improved, the pulping capacity of the acid digesters not only failed to meet the needs of production, but also the pulp cooked in the acid digesters often failed to meet quality standards. In order to increase the output and quality of the pulp, the factory learned from advanced Soviet experience and began installing a No. 1 acid digester liquor circulation device in May of this year, which was completed on June 5th. During the construction, they received concrete assistance from Soviet experts Trugov and Lejantev.
    After the successful installation of the liquor circulation device, the No. 1 acid digester underwent test cooking, and the production situation was very good. It is now in formal production. Thanks to the circulation device, the cooking liquor in the digester can circulate up and down during pulping, giving full play to its function and reducing the amount of liquor required. The cooking time can be shortened. Because of the changes in cooking conditions, the amount of reeds (the raw material for pulping) loaded per pot can also be increased. In total, the daily pulp output can be increased by more than 20 percent, ensuring the needs of the paper machine. In terms of pulp quality, it can be guaranteed to eliminate raw pulp and burnt pulp, thus also reducing the amount of bleaching liquid used. The above items can save the country over 10 billion yuan annually.

    一项技术革新可节约百余亿元
    国营天津造纸总厂造纸机生产能力提高后，酸煮锅制浆能力不但不能满足生产的需要，而且，酸煮锅蒸煮出来的纸浆经常不能全部合格。为了提高纸浆的产量和质量，该厂学习苏联先进经验，今年五月开始安装一号酸煮锅药液循环装置，在六月五日全部完工。在施工中，得到了苏联专家特鲁果夫和列扬杰夫的具体帮助。
    药液循环装置安装成功后，一号酸煮锅经过试煮，生产情况十分良好，现在已正式生产。由于有了循环装置，在蒸煮纸浆时，锅内的蒸煮药液可以上下循环，充分发挥作用，减少了药液的需用量；蒸煮时间可以缩短；因为蒸煮情况的变更，每锅装苇（制浆的原料）的数量也可以增加，总计每天的纸浆产量约可提高百分之二十以上，保证了造纸机的需要。在纸浆质量上可以保证消灭生浆和糊浆，因而也可以减少漂白液的用量。以上几项，全年可为国家节约一百余亿元。
