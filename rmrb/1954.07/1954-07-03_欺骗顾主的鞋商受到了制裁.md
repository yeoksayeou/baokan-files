    Shoe Merchants Who Deceived Customers Sanctioned

    A letter from the Chengdu Municipal People's Government Administration for Industry and Commerce: The People's Daily published a "Reader's Letters Summary" on March 2nd, titled "Private Factories Deceiving Customers Should Be Sanctioned," exposing the behavior of many private leather factories in Wanxian City, Sichuan Province, who deceived customers. Similar situations are also common and serious in Chengdu. Therefore, our bureau also combined the newspaper's criticism with necessary exposure and treatment of the illegal activities of private leather merchants in Chengdu.

    In Chengdu, more than a dozen private shoe stores, including Jicheng Yong, Hengsheng, Zhizu, Rongxin, Kangle, Qingnian, and Dasheng, successively distributed promotional leaflets to many factories, mines, government offices, troops, and schools in Northeast, Inner Mongolia, Northwest and other places last July and August, using deceptive means to solicit orders, claiming that the leather shoes they manufactured were cheap and good quality, and delivered quickly. As a result, these shoemakers received a large number of orders, exceeding their own production capacity; many merchants also diverted the payment for speculative business, snapping up raw materials such as cowhide and rubber soles; therefore, customers could not receive the ordered shoes for a long time. By the end of April this year, more than 2,000 pairs of leather shoes ordered but not delivered by more than ten shoemakers in Chengdu were worth more than 200 million yuan in total. Some private merchants also cut corners during the production process, resulting in poor quality leather shoes. This illegal behavior has caused losses to the broad masses of people.

    After we investigated the above situation, we have ordered these shoemakers to deliver the orders within a limited time; if the number of orders accepted is too large and exceeds their own production capacity, they are also required to return the order payments within a limited time. At the same time, we have also conducted a comprehensive inspection of the raw materials and finished products of each shoe store to prevent them from cutting corners and producing shoddy products. Some unscrupulous merchants who have committed serious illegal acts have been given penalties such as suspension of business, fines, and warnings, depending on the severity of the circumstances.

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    欺骗顾主的鞋商受到了制裁
    成都市人民政府工商行政管理局来信：三月二日人民日报登载了以“私营厂商欺骗顾主应受制裁”为题的“读者来信综述”，揭发了四川省万县市不少私营制革厂欺骗顾主的行为。类似情况，在成都市也普遍而严重地存在着。因此，我局也结合报纸的批评，对成都市私营制革商的违法行为进行了必要的揭发和处理。
    成都市集成永、恒升、知足、荣新、康乐、青年、大胜等十数家私营皮鞋商店，在去年七、八月间曾先后用欺骗手段向东北、内蒙古、西北等地很多厂矿、机关、部队、学校散发承揽订货的宣传单，说他们制造的皮鞋价廉物美、交货迅速。结果这些制鞋商收到大批订货，超过了他们本身的生产能力；不少商人又将货款挪作投机生意，抢购牛皮、胶底等材料；因而顾主就长期拿不到订购的皮鞋。到今年四月底止，成都市十余户制鞋商逾期未交的皮鞋就有二千余双，货款总值达二亿余元。还有一些私商在制作过程中偷工减料，所制的皮鞋质量低劣。这种不法行为已使广大群众受到了损失。
    经我们查明以上情况以后，已责成这些制鞋商限期交清订货；如承揽订货太多已超过本身生产能力，也限期将所收的订货款退回。同时还对各制鞋商店的原料和成品进行了全面的检查，制止他们的偷工减料，粗制滥造的行为。对某些有严重违法行为的奸商，也分别情节轻重，予以停业，罚金，警告等处分。
