The CPC Beijing Municipal Committee directly under each major factory and mine committee, recently on the basis of in-depth study of the resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party, focused on examining the implementation of the Party's principle of collective leadership.

The Party committees of major factories and mines in Beijing have basically implemented the Party's principle of collective leadership. However, the inspection revealed that there are still many shortcomings and problems in the implementation of the principle of collective leadership by the Party committees. Some Party committees can often hold meetings, but the preparation work for the meetings is poor and the quality is low, and the role of collective leadership has not been fully utilized. Party committee plenary meetings are often convened on a temporary basis, and committee members do not have enough time to prepare for the meeting, and cannot put forward opinions at the meeting, even if they do, they are not mature enough. As a result, the discussion of the issues at the meeting is not sufficient, the conclusions are not clear, and it is difficult to implement them. The Party Secretary and Director of the Beijing Telecommunications Bureau both made comprehensive speeches at the Party committee meetings, making it unclear to the participants whose opinion was the conclusion, and the resolutions could not be well implemented. The poor implementation of the collective leadership system is also reflected in the fact that the Party committee does not have a fixed meeting system. Some units rarely hold Party committee plenary meetings, which are often replaced by Party committee standing committee or party, administrative, trade union, and Communist Youth League leaders' meetings. The standing committee does not have a system of reporting work to the Party committee plenary meetings. Some major issues have been dealt with, and some Party committee members are still unaware. Some units often use extended cadre meetings with unclear nature to discuss and decide on major issues, distinguishing between whether it is an extended Party committee meeting or an extended administrative meeting. Some units do not bring more important issues to the Party committee meetings for discussion. For example, when the Jingxi Mining Bureau launched the anti-waste movement in the first half of this year, the administrative side did not bring such issues related to the Party's policies to the Party committee for discussion, but made decisions individually. Some Party committees paid attention to discussing production issues, while the Party's organizational and propaganda work and the work of the trade union and the Communist Youth League have not been discussed for a long time or discussed very little. These aspects of work are mostly led by the Party committee secretary personally. There are also individual Party committees that only deal with routine Party affairs and rarely intervene in production. In addition to reporting work to all Party members during the re-election, the Party committees generally do not have a system of regularly reporting work to all Party members, so that the work of the Party committees cannot be supervised by all Party members. The shortcomings in the implementation of the principle of collective leadership are also reflected in the fact that the Party committee makes many decisions, but the inspection and summary work is very poor. The poor implementation of the Party's principle of collective leadership hinders the development of criticism and affects the unity of the Party committee. The internal relations of some Party committees are not coordinated enough.

The reason why the Party committee fails to implement the collective leadership system well is primarily because the members of the Party committee do not have a sufficient understanding of the Party's principle of collective leadership and do not attach enough importance to it. On the one hand, the Party committee secretary does not promote democracy enough and does not create conditions for the members to consider the overall work. The Party committee meetings are often convened after the secretary prepares. Sometimes the Party committee secretary also insists on his own opinions and does not humbly consider the opinions of others. In some units, no decisions can be made without the Party committee secretary attending the meeting, or the decisions cannot be implemented even if they are made. On the other hand, the Party committee members do not have a strong sense of responsibility, rely on the Party committee secretary and cadres who are divorced from production, emphasize that they do not understand the situation, and are not very concerned about the overall work of the Party, especially Party committee members who also hold important positions such as factory directors and trade union chairmen, who rarely consider the overall work and often only consider it from the needs of their own work, making it impossible to reach a consensus. Some units do not clearly define the scope of issues that the Party committee should discuss and decide, especially issues related to production work, which also prevents the Party committee from playing its role in collective leadership.

Through this study and inspection, the members of the Party committees of various units have gained a further understanding of the Party's principle of collective leadership, and unanimously believe that collective leadership is the Party's highest leadership principle and an important guarantee for consolidating the Party's unity. Some units have changed their past satisfaction with the collective leadership in form, believing that being able to hold meetings frequently means adhering to the principle of collective leadership. The Party Secretary of the People's Printing Plant used to think that the Party committee held meetings frequently and major issues were also discussed at the meetings, and that there were no problems with the implementation of the collective leadership system. After this inspection, he realized that the quality of the Party committee meetings was not high, the discussion of issues was not sufficient, and the role of collective leadership was not fully utilized. He must greatly improve in the future and overcome formalism. Some Party committee members did not have a sufficient understanding of the importance of the principle of collective leadership in the past, and therefore did not have a strong sense of responsibility. They also reviewed their mistakes during this inspection. For example, Gao Feng, a member of the Party committee of the Beijing Public Transport Company (whose administrative position is Deputy Manager and Director of the Operations Department), used to think that "attending Party committee meetings was to understand the spirit in order to do the work well," and held a "listening" attitude at the Party committee meetings, rarely considering issues or expressing opinions. After this inspection, he realized that he was a member of the Party committee and should participate in the leadership work of the Party committee with a positive attitude. After study and inspection, the phenomena of disunity and disharmony within the Party committees have been basically resolved, and the Party's unity has been strengthened. Taking the Party Branch Committee of the Liulihe Cement Plant as an example, in the past, the factory director Yuan Gongting was arrogant and complacent and neglected the Party's guarantee and supervision role, the Party secretary was liberal and could not adhere to principles, and most of the members had sectarian sentiments, suspected each other, and were dissatisfied with each other. During this inspection, most of them conducted serious and sincere criticism and self-criticism, and the problem of disunity was resolved. The Party member factory directors or managers of other factories and mines also had a clearer understanding of the importance of relying on the Party's leadership as an important guarantee for the implementation of the one-chief responsibility system.

After the inspection, the Party committees of various factories and mines have made resolutions to improve the problems that existed in the implementation of the collective leadership system in the past. For example, the decision of the Party committee of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant on strengthening collective leadership stipulates that the leading members of the Party committee should strengthen their sense of responsibility for the overall work, and each member must do a good job in the work he is responsible for from the overall situation, and oppose the tendencies of departmentalism, decentralism, and emphasizing individual leadership. In order to strengthen collective leadership, the leading core of the Party committee is required to fully promote democracy, carry out criticism and self-criticism, and strengthen the unity of the leading members of the Party committee. The decision also stipulates several working systems to ensure the implementation of the collective leadership system, such as regularly convening Party committee plenary meetings and standing committee meetings; the Party committee office should regularly provide each member with necessary materials for considering issues; and improve the system of inspection and summary work. In order to fully promote inner-Party democracy and give play to the supervisory role of all Party members in the work of the Party committee, the Party committee decided that it must convene a Party member representative meeting every six months to report work, and convene Party activist meetings as needed, in order to widely absorb Party members to participate in the Party's leadership work.

### 中共北京市委直属各主要厂矿委员会  检查贯彻集体领导原则的情况

    中共北京市委直属各主要厂矿委员会
    检查贯彻集体领导原则的情况
    中共北京市委直属各主要厂矿委员会，最近在深入学习党的七届四中全会决议的基础上，集中检查了贯彻党的集体领导原则的情况。
    北京市各主要厂矿党委会基本上贯彻了党的集体领导原则。但是，从检查中发现，目前党委会在贯彻集体领导原则方面仍然存在不少缺点和问题。有的党委会虽然也能经常开会，但会议的准备工作差，质量低，并没有充分发挥集体领导作用。党委会全体会议常是临时召集，委员没有充分时间准备开会，到会上提不出意见，即使提出意见也不够成熟。这样，就使会议对问题的讨论不充分，结论不明确，执行起来困难很多。北京电信局党委书记和局长在党委会议上都做综合性发言，使参加会议的人弄不清谁的意见是结论，决议不能很好贯彻。集体领导制贯彻得不好还表现在党委没有一定的会议制度，有的单位党委全体会议开得很少，经常是被党委常委会或党、行政、工会、青年团负责人碰头会所代替，常委又没有向党委全体会议报告工作的制度，有的重大问题处理了，有些党委委员还不知道。有的单位还常以性质不明确的扩大干部会来讨论决定重大问题，分不清是党委扩大会还是行政扩大会。有的单位不把比较重大的问题拿到党委会上讨论。例如京西矿务局今年上半年开展反浪费运动时，行政方面就没有把这样有关党的政策的问题提到党委会上讨论，而是个人作了决定。有些党委会注意了讨论生产问题，而对党的组织、宣传工作和工会、青年团工作长期未加讨论或讨论很少，这些方面的工作多由党委书记个人领导。也有个别的党委会还仅只处理日常党务工作，对生产很少过问。党的委员会除改选时向全体党员报告一次工作外，一般都没有定期向全体党员报告工作的制度，以致党委会的工作不能受到全体党员的监督。贯彻集体领导原则的缺点还表现在党委决定问题多，检查和总结工作很差。党的集体领导原则贯彻不好，批评展不开，影响了党委会的团结。有些党委会的内部关系还不够协调。
    党委贯彻集体领导制不好的原因，首先是党委的成员对党的集体领导原则认识不足，重视不够。一方面，党委书记发扬民主不够，没有创造条件使委员有可能考虑全面工作，党委会议常是书记准备一下就开会，有时党委书记还坚持自己的意见，不虚心考虑别人意见。有的单位党委书记不出席会议就做不出决定，或者做了决定也贯彻不了。另一方面，党委委员的责任心不强，依赖党委书记和脱离生产的干部，强调不了解情况，对党的全面工作不太关心，特别是兼有重要职务的党委委员如厂长、工会主席等，对全面工作考虑很少，常常只从本身工作的需要出发考虑问题，使意见不能一致。有些单位对党委所应讨论和决定的问题特别是有关生产工作问题的范围划分不清，也使党委会不能很好发挥集体领导作用。
    通过这次学习和检查，各单位党委成员对党的集体领导的原则有了进一步的认识，一致认识到集体领导是党的最高领导原则，是巩固党的团结和统一的重要保证。若干单位改变了过去满足于形式上的集体领导，认为能够经常开会就算坚持了集体领导原则的看法。人民印刷厂党委书记过去就认为党委会经常开，重大问题也都拿到会上讨论了，集体领导制的贯彻没什么问题。这次检查之后，他认识到党委会议质量不高，对问题讨论不充分，实际上没有充分发挥集体领导作用，今后还必须大大改进，克服形式主义的毛病。有些党委委员过去对集体领导原则的重要性认识不足，因而责任感不强。这次检查中也都检讨了自己的错误。如北京市公共汽车公司党委会委员高峰（行政职务是副经理兼运营科长），过去认为“参加党委会议为了领会精神，好做工作”，在党委会议上抱着“听会”的态度，很少考虑问题和发表意见。这次检查后认识到自己是党委的一员，应该以积极的态度参加党委会的领导工作。经过学习和检查，党委会内部的不团结不协调现象基本上得到解决，党的团结增强了。以琉璃河水泥厂总支委员会为例，过去该厂厂长袁功廷骄傲自满忽视党的保证监督作用，党委书记自由主义，不能坚持原则，大部分委员有宗派情绪，互相猜疑，互不满意。在这次检查中，大都进行了严肃的、诚恳的批评和自我批评，不团结的问题解决了。其它厂矿党员厂长或经理对依靠党的领导是贯彻一长负责制的重要保证也有了较明确的认识。
    各厂矿党委在检查之后都针对过去贯彻集体领导制方面存在的问题做出了改进的决议。如石景山钢铁厂党委关于加强集体领导的决定中规定：党委领导成员加强自己对全面工作的责任心，每个委员必须从全局出发做好本人所负担的工作，反对本位主义、分散主义及强调个人领导的倾向。为了加强集体领导，要求党委领导核心充分发扬民主，开展批评和自我批评，加强党委领导成员的团结。决定中还规定了若干保证贯彻集体领导制的工作制度，如定期召开党委全体会议和常委会；党委办公机构要经常供给各委员必要的材料以便考虑问题；健全检查总结工作的制度等。为了充分发扬党内民主，发挥全体党员对党委工作的监督作用，党委决定今后每半年必须召集一次党员代表会议报告工作，并视工作需要召集党的活动分子会议，以便广泛地吸收党员来参加党的领导工作。　 （刘叔达）
