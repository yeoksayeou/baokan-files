The Shijiazhuang Power Machinery Plant has successfully trial-produced a 25-horsepower steam tractor.

The steam tractor is a type of steam-powered machinery, named so because its steam engine is mounted on top of the boiler. It uses coal or firewood as fuel, is more efficient than existing general irrigation machinery, is inexpensive, sturdy, and durable, and is suitable for rural irrigation or as other power sources. This type of steam tractor can move on its own, and with an axial-flow pump, can be used to pump water for irrigation or drainage in different areas in rotation.

From April 16th to 18th, this machinery plant cooperated with an axial-flow pump in Baoding, Hebei, for a water pumping test. At a head of 4.3 meters, it could pump 700 to 1,000 tons of water per hour. Calculating on the basis of watering every half-month, it could irrigate 5,670 mu of land per year.

The steam tractor has a wide range of uses. In addition to agricultural irrigation and drainage, it can also be used for mine drainage, ventilation, or hoisting and transportation, timber processing in forest areas, hoisting and transportation in construction projects, processing agricultural products in rural areas, and as a prime mover for factories in other power-deficient areas or small cities. In addition, it can also drive small generators. A 25-horsepower steam tractor can generate enough electricity to supply about 1,000 15-watt light bulbs, which can be used for lighting in railway stations, small towns, or rural areas.

Recently, this machinery plant will also conduct actual water lifting irrigation tests of the steam tractor at the Nanchang River outside the wall of the Summer Palace in the western suburbs of Beijing, in order to solicit opinions more widely to improve the existing shortcomings of the steam tractor and promote the establishment of pumping stations using steam tractors to develop water conservancy irrigation and increase agricultural production.

    石家庄动力机械厂制成二十五马力锅驼机
    石家庄动力机械厂试制二十五马力锅驼机成功。
    锅驼机是一种蒸汽动力机械，因为它的蒸汽机装在锅炉上面，所以叫做锅驼机。它用煤或木柴作燃料，比现有一般灌溉机械效能大，费用低廉，坚固耐用，适用于农村灌溉或作为其他动力之用。这种锅驼机能自行移动，带上轴流式水泵，可以轮流分区抽水灌溉或排水。
    四月十六日至十八日，这个机械厂曾在河北保定配合轴流式水泵作抽水试验，扬程四点三公尺时每小时可抽水七百至一千吨，以每半月轮浇一次计算，一年可灌溉五千六百七十亩土地。
    锅驼机的用途很广泛，除了农业灌溉与排水外，还可以用于矿区排水、通风或起重运输，林区木材加工，建筑工程起重运输，农村农产品加工及其他电源缺乏地区或小城市工厂用作原动力。此外，也可以带动小型发电机，一台二十五马力锅驼机的发电量约能供给一千个十五瓦的电灯，可作为铁路车站、小城镇或农村照明用。
    最近，这个机械厂还要在北京西郊颐和园墙外南长河进行锅驼机的实际扬水灌溉试验，以便更广泛地听取意见，以改进锅驼机目前尚存在的一些缺点，并促进应用锅驼机建立扬水站，以发展水利灌溉，增加农业生产。
