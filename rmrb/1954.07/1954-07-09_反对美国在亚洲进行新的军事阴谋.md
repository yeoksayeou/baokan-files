    An important characteristic of the current international situation is that the efforts of peace-loving countries around the world to strive for peace have achieved considerable success. The discussions at the Geneva Conference on restoring peace in Indochina are progressing with the joint efforts of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and all forces that desire peace; the military conference between the Vietnamese People's Army and the General Command delegation of the French forces in Indochina has also been convened. The recent talks between the Prime Ministers of China and India and the Prime Ministers of China and Burma have made significant contributions to maintaining peace in Asia and the world. Public opinion in all countries unanimously believes that these developments in the international situation are greatly conducive to the consolidation of peace in Asia and the further relaxation of the world situation.
    However, the U.S. ruling clique is still stubbornly pursuing its policy of maintaining tension, attempting to counter the efforts of peace-loving countries around the world to strive for peace. Although the U.S. ruling clique's conspiracies to antagonize the People's Republic of China have repeatedly failed, they have not learned the lessons they should have learned from these facts, and are still recklessly engaging in a series of aggressive and adventurous activities in Asia. In these activities, Van Fleet has played a disgraceful role. Since the end of April this year, Van Fleet, in the name of U.S. President Eisenhower's "special representative," has traveled twice from Washington to the Far East, shuttling between Tokyo, Seoul, and Taiwan, and holding multiple secret meetings with Yoshida, Syngman Rhee, and Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, as well as U.S. military leaders in the Far East. U.S. propaganda agencies make no secret of the fact that Van Fleet's conspiratorial activities are preparing for a new U.S. military adventure in Asia.
    According to U.S. news agencies, one of Van Fleet's objectives in the Far East is to organize a military bloc including Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and the Ryukyu Islands. This, coupled with the U.S. imperialists' attempts to revive the war in Korea and to organize a so-called "defense group" in Southeast Asia, further exposes the U.S.'s aggressive ambitions in Asia. An article published in the "Christian Science Monitor" on June 15th revealed: "The United States has already drawn a new line of defense in the western Pacific, which supplements and expands the Acheson Line of January 1950. This new line starts from the northern tip of Japan, descends along the entire chain of large islands, and includes the East Indies." The article also stated that this so-called "line of defense" should "extend to the Asian continent in two places." On June 26th, the Washington Post revealed that the U.S. National Security Council has formulated a policy to establish three lines of defense in the Far East. The first line is in Vietnam, the second line includes all islands from South Korea, Taiwan, and the Philippines to Indonesia, while Thailand, Burma, and Malaya are also included, and the third line includes all U.S. trust territories, Pacific territories, and Japan. Obviously, the U.S.'s plan to organize military aggression groups in Southeast Asia and the Far East is based on the loss of sovereignty of many countries, the enslavement of many nations, and the loss of the rights and interests of Britain and France.
    However, the U.S. ruling clique's evil deeds against the Asian people are extremely unpopular. The U.S. instructed the Syngman Rhee group to convene an "Asian Nations Anti-Communist Conference" at the U.S. naval base in Zhenhai, South Korea, on June 15th this year. However, even the Philippines and Thailand were unwilling to send official representatives to such an ugly conference. As a result, this "Asian Nations Anti-Communist Conference," which had been heavily publicized, had to be changed to a conference of "opinion representatives." Of the twenty-nine people attending the conference, fourteen were fugitives from the Kuomintang bandit gangs in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, and the Ryukyu Islands. It can be seen how the U.S.'s conspiratorial activities in Asia have created a situation of widespread opposition.
    After the U.S. forced the breakdown of the Geneva Conference negotiations on the Korean issue, the Syngman Rhee group, acting on the instructions of its master, repeatedly clamored that it was not bound by the Korean Armistice Agreement and wantonly demanded a "decisive battle" in Korea as soon as possible. At this time, the U.S. sent Van Fleet to South Korea, and then to Taiwan. It is very clear that Van Fleet is shouldering a special mission to accelerate the planning of the U.S.'s evil plan to invade the entire Asia. When U.S. Secretary of Defense Wilson announced the dispatch of Van Fleet to the Far East in April, he openly stated that Van Fleet would "make recommendations" on "the future size and composition of the South Korean active armed forces, and whether the joint U.S.-South Korean plan for establishing a Korean reserve force is feasible"; and would "study" the possibility of dispatching Syngman Rhee's troops "to other places in the Far East." The U.S. aggressors vainly attempt to drive the Syngman Rhee group to provide cannon fodder for the U.S.'s aggressive war against the entire Asia under the "disengagement" principle of not suffering serious sacrifices themselves. The U.S. also wants to rearm Japan and further utilize the remaining bandit gang of Chiang Kai-shek in Taiwan in order to threaten peace in Asia and the world.
    The U.S. aggressors' occupation of our Taiwan Province and the conspiratorial activities they are carrying out in Taiwan are the most blatant aggression and provocation against the People's Republic of China. Since 1950, the U.S. aggressors have been trying to turn Taiwan into a military base for them to prepare for expanding their aggression against the Asian continent. The U.S. Seventh Fleet protects the remaining bandit gang of Chiang Kai-shek in Taiwan, U.S. military personnel are busy reorganizing Chiang Kai-shek's defeated troops, and the U.S. is sending spies and saboteurs from Taiwan to sneak into the Chinese mainland, organizing armed harassment against China's coast and carrying out piratical looting of merchant ships of various countries, in order to hinder China's trade with other countries. The U.S. government even stubbornly insists on stuffing the political zombie of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang into China's seat in the United Nations, barbarously obliterating the legitimate rights and status of the People's Republic of China in international affairs.
    Now Van Fleet's activities in Taiwan further expose that the U.S. aggressors have no intention of repenting, attempting to close the door to the world people's voice for peace, and to fix the criminal act of invading China and occupying Taiwan in the form of a treaty. When Van Fleet left Taiwan, he openly stated that there "should be a mutual security bilateral treaty" between the U.S. and Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang, just like the treaties that the U.S. has signed with Japan, the Philippines, and the Syngman Rhee group. At the same time, it is said that Van Fleet will also likely suggest expanding the scope of the U.S. Seventh Fleet's activities in invading China's territorial waters and territories to certain islands off the Chinese coast. However, the shortsighted policy of the U.S. warmongers is unpopular in Asia and around the world, and is increasingly unsupported even in its allied countries, and even causing dissatisfaction among some people in the United States.
    We should solemnly warn the U.S. war peddlers like Van Fleet that the remaining bandit gang of Chiang Kai-shek is a small handful of festering zombies, and cannot be supported at all. If you want to rely on such rotten things to piece together some "North Pacific Military Alliance," you will not only lose your own capital, but also be scolded by the whole world. Your attempt to rely on these lackeys to carry out new military adventures is completely a dead end with no future. Facts have proved that the U.S.'s efforts to obliterate the international status of the People's Republic of China are futile. The People's Republic of China is inviolable. We adhere to a foreign policy of peaceful coexistence. Britain and other Western countries also demand to improve their relations with the People's Republic of China and restore and develop their economic and cultural exchanges with the People's Republic of China. As a result of the separate talks between the Prime Ministers of China and India and the Prime Ministers of China and Burma, our friendship with India, Burma, and other Southeast Asian countries has become even more cordial, and the friendly relations between Asian countries will be further developed. Major Asian countries and some Western countries have expressed their hope to promote the restoration of peace in Indochina and ease the tense situation in Asia. This clearly shows that the U.S.'s plan to create war in Asia by relying on Syngman Rhee, Chiang Kai-shek, and other puppet groups is doomed to failure. It was so in the past, and it is even more so now.
    Van Fleet's provocative conspiratorial activities show that the U.S. ruling clique completely disregards the general trend of the world and stubbornly continues its adventurous policy that is running into walls everywhere. The Chinese people and all peace-loving governments and peoples have the power and must stop the U.S.'s adventurous activities, stop the U.S. and Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang from concluding any "mutual security bilateral treaty," stop the U.S.'s plan to piece together military blocs, and strive for the continued progress of the Geneva Conference consultations to seek peace in Indochina, and further ease the tense situation in Asia and the world.

### 反对美国在亚洲进行新的军事阴谋

    反对美国在亚洲进行新的军事阴谋
    当前国际局势的一个重要特点，是世界爱好和平的国家争取和平的努力已取得了相当大的成就。日内瓦会议关于恢复印度支那和平问题的讨论，在苏联、中华人民共和国、越南民主共和国及一切愿望和平的力量共同努力下，正在日益进展；越南人民军和印度支那法军总司令部代表团之间举行的军事会议也已召开。最近中印两国总理和中缅两国总理的会谈对维护亚洲与世界和平作出了重大的贡献。各国公众舆论一致认为，国际局势的这些发展，大大有利于亚洲和平的巩固和世界局势的进一步缓和。
    但是，美国统治集团仍在顽固地执行着它维持紧张局势的政策，企图与世界爱好和平国家争取和平的努力相对抗。美国统治集团敌视中华人民共和国的阴谋虽然连续遭到了失败，他们却没有从这些事实中取得应有的教训，依然不顾一切地在亚洲进行着一系列的侵略冒险活动。在这些活动中，范佛里特担负了一个可耻的角色。自今年四月底以来，范佛里特以美国总统艾森豪威尔的“特别代表”的名义，两度从华盛顿到远东，在东京、汉城、台湾之间来来去去，与吉田、李承晚和蒋匪介石以及远东美国军事首脑举行了多次的秘密会谈。美国宣传机构毫不掩饰，范佛里特的阴谋活动是为美国在亚洲发动新的军事冒险作准备。
    据美国通讯社透露，范佛里特在远东活动的目的之一，就是要组织一个包括日本、南朝鲜、台湾及琉球群岛在内的军事集团。这加上美帝国主义在朝鲜企图使战争复起，在东南亚企图组织所谓“防务集团”，就更加暴露了美国对亚洲的侵略野心。美国“基督教科学箴言报”六月十五日刊载的一篇文章中透露：“美国已经在西部太平洋划出一条新的防御线，这条防线补充并扩张了一九五○年一月艾奇逊的防线。这条新的防线起自日本北部的尖端顺着下来包括大岛屿链锁的全部并包括东印度群岛在内。”这篇文章并说，这条所谓“防线”要“在两个地方伸展到亚洲大陆去”。六月二十六日华盛顿邮报透露，美国国家安全委员会已拟定一项政策，在远东设立三道防线，第一道防线在越南，第二道防线包括南朝鲜、台湾、菲律宾，直到印尼的所有岛屿，而泰国、缅甸、马来亚也在内，第三道防线包括所有美国领土托管地区、太平洋属地和日本在内。显然，美国在东南亚和远东组织军事侵略集团的计划，是以许多国家的丧失主权，许多民族的被奴役，和英法两国权益的损失为其内容的。
    然而，美国统治集团反对亚洲人民的罪恶勾当是十分不得人心的。美国曾指使李承晚集团在今年六月十五日，在南朝鲜的美国海军基地镇海召开了
  一个“亚洲国家反共会议”，但是，就连菲律宾和泰国，也不愿派遣正式代表参加这样丑恶的会议，结果这个曾被大事张扬的“亚洲国家反共会议”不得不改成了“舆论代表”的会议。出席会议的二十九个人中，就有十四个是来自台湾、香港、澳门、琉球的国民党匪帮的亡命之徒。可见美国在亚洲的阴谋活动是如何地造成了众叛亲离的局面了。
    美国迫使日内瓦会议关于朝鲜问题的谈判破裂以后，李承晚集团秉承其主子的意旨，一再叫嚣不受朝鲜停战协定的约束，并狂妄地要尽快在朝鲜进行“决战”。正在这个时候，美国派了范佛里特去南朝鲜，接着又去台湾。很显然，范佛里特是负担着一种特别的使命，加紧策划美国侵略整个亚洲罪恶计划。美国国防部部长威尔逊在四月间宣布派遣范佛里特来远东活动时，公开说范佛里特要就“韩国现役武装部队将来的规模和组成问题，以及为建立一支朝鲜后备军而拟订的美韩联合计划是否可行”的问题“提出建议”；并且要“研究”派遣李承晚军队“到远东其他地方去”的可能性。美国侵略者妄想在不使自己遭到严重牺牲的“脱身”原则下，驱使李承晚集团为美国对整个亚洲的侵略战争提供炮灰。美国还想重新武装日本、进一步利用台湾蒋介石残余匪帮，以便威胁亚洲与世界的和平。
    美国侵略者侵占我国台湾省，并在台湾进行的阴谋活动，是对中华人民共和国的最露骨的侵略和挑衅。一九五○年以来，美国侵略者无时无刻不想法把台湾变为它准备扩大侵略亚洲大陆的军事据点。美国第七舰队庇护着台湾的蒋介石残余匪帮，美国军事人员忙着重新整编蒋介石的残兵败将，美国并从台湾派遣间谍和破坏分子潜入中国的大陆，组织对中国沿海的武装骚扰，和对各国商船实行海盗式的劫掠，以阻碍我国与其他各国的贸易。美国政府居然至今还硬把蒋介石匪帮的政治僵尸塞在联合国中的中国席位上，横蛮地抹煞中华人民共和国在国际事务中的合法权利和地位。
    现在范佛里特在台湾的活动，更暴露了美国侵略者毫无悔祸之心，企图对世界人民的一片和平呼声关死大门，把侵略中国强占台湾这件罪恶行为用条约形式固定下来，范佛里特在离开台湾的时候，公然表示美国和蒋介石匪帮之间“应有一项共同安全双边条约”，正同美国已与日本、菲律宾和李承晚集团所签订的条约一样。同时据说，范佛里特还将可能建议把美国第七舰队侵犯中国领海和领土的活动范围扩大到中国海岸的某些岛屿。但是美国好战分子的鼠目寸光的政策，在亚洲和全世界都是不得人心的，在它的盟国中也越来越得不到支持了，甚至在美国也引起一部分人的不满。
    我们应该正告美国的战争贩子范佛里特之流，蒋介石残余匪帮是一小撮溃烂了的僵尸，根本是撑不起来的，你们要想依靠这类腐臭的东西来拼凑甚么“北太平洋军事联盟”，就不但要使你们自己赔了老本，而且更要使你们受到全世界的责骂。你们想依靠这一些喽罗来进行新的军事冒险，完全是自寻死路，毫无前途。事实证明，美国极力要抹煞中华人民共和国的国际地位，那是徒劳无功的。中华人民共和国是不可侵犯的，我们坚持和平共处的外交政策，英国和其他西方国家也都要求改善它们和中华人民共和国的关系，并恢复和发展它们和中华人民共和国的经济和文化交流。中印两国总理、中缅两国总理分别举行会谈的结果，我国与印度、缅甸以及与东南亚各国的邦交更加敦睦，亚洲各国的友好关系将进一步发展起来。亚洲主要国家和一些西方国家都表示希望促成印度支那恢复和平，缓和亚洲紧张局势。这就清楚地说明了美国依靠李承晚、蒋介石和其他傀儡集团在亚洲制造战争的打算，是注定要失败的。从前如此，现在更是如此。
    范佛里特的挑衅性的阴谋活动，表明了美国统治集团完全无视世界大势，顽固地继续着它到处碰壁的冒险政策。中国人民及一切爱好和平的各国政府和人民有力量和必须制止美国的冒险活动，制止美国和蒋介石匪帮订立什么“共同安全双边条约”，制止美国拼凑军事集团的计划并争取日内瓦会议谋求印度支那和平的协商继续进展，把亚洲和全世界的紧张局势进一步缓和下来。
