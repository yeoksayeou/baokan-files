    Shaanxi and Shandong Provinces are supporting flood-stricken areas with large quantities of seeds.

    Shaanxi Province's support of millions of jin of various seeds to flood-stricken areas in Henan and Anhui provinces has begun to be transported eastward.

    The Party and government leading organs of Shaanxi Province decided to support farmers in disaster areas in Henan and Anhui provinces to replant crops with 1.5 million jin of "Bi Ma No. 1" and "6028" improved wheat varieties, 800,000 jin of buckwheat seeds, and more than 3.6 million jin of potato seeds. After receiving relevant instructions, the leading organs of the Yan'an Special District immediately mobilized farmers to use 1,500 donkeys to transport 500,000 jin of buckwheat seeds from Wuqi, Ansai, and other three counties to Yan'an within ten days, so that they could be quickly transferred to railway lines by trucks. More than 20 agricultural workers from the Fufeng Production Farm proposed "carrying seeds and production without delaying each other" and striving to complete the task of transferring seeds before the rainy season. Many farmers in the Chengguan District of Fufeng County also came to help load and transport. It is estimated that all seeds can be shipped by the end of August. (Xinhua News Agency)

    The agricultural and forestry departments and cooperatives of Shandong Province will transfer a large number of buckwheat, potato, and carrot seeds to Anhui, Hubei, and Jiangsu provinces to support farmers in flood-stricken areas to replant late autumn crops. The Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the Shandong Provincial People's Government has sent people to conduct germination tests on the 300,000 jin of buckwheat seeds that will be shipped to Anhui and Hubei. The Shandong Provincial Cooperative General Agency is organizing supply and marketing cooperatives in six special districts, including Wendeng, Laiyang, and Jining, to purchase 11 million jin of potatoes to supply to Anhui and Jiangsu provinces, and some have already begun to be transferred.

    陕西山东两省支援水灾地区大量种籽
    陕西省支援河南、安徽等省遭受水灾地区的数百万斤各种种籽，已经开始东运。
    陕西省党、政领导机关决定以一百五十万斤“碧蚂一号”和“六零二八”小麦良种、八十万斤荞麦种籽和三百六十多万斤马铃薯种籽，支援河南、安徽等省灾区农民进行补种。延安专区领导机关接到有关指示后，立即动员农民用一千五百头毛驴，先把吴旗、安塞等三县的五十万斤荞麦种籽十天内运到延安，以便用汽车迅速向铁路沿线转运。扶风生产农场的二十多名农业工人提出“装运种籽和生产两不误”，争取在雨季前完成调运种籽的任务。扶风县城关区许多农民也来帮助装运。预计在八月底以前全部种籽可以运完。（新华社）
