The talks between the Prime Ministers of China and India, and the Prime Ministers of China and Burma, are major events of historic significance. They fully reflect the peace aspirations of the Asian people and mark a new development in friendly relations between Asian countries. Therefore, these two talks have aroused widespread attention and warm welcome from public opinion in Asia and around the world, and have had a far-reaching impact on the hearts of people around the world.

Many newspapers and periodicals in India, Burma, Indonesia, and other countries have excitedly called these two talks "a ray of new hope shining in the hearts of the people of the world," "an unforgettable event," and "historic meetings" that "fill the hearts of millions with joy and excitement," marking a "new era" of peaceful relations between Asian countries and "a victory for peace and friendship throughout Asia, especially Southeast Asia." The Nepalese government authorities also welcomed the joint statement of the Sino-Indian Prime Ministers' talks.

It is quite clear that the widespread concern and welcome that the Sino-Indian and Sino-Burmese talks have won in Asia are by no means accidental.

Asian public opinion is satisfied that the results of the Sino-Indian and Sino-Burmese talks have powerfully expressed the urgent desire of the Asian people to quickly end the bloodshed and restore peace in Indochina, and to demand that the Geneva Conference reach a peaceful agreement on this issue. The "Hindu" welcomed the "conciliatory attitude" of peaceful democratic countries on the Indochina issue, pointing out that "what is urgently needed now" is "to stop the war in Indochina," and believes that the joint statement of the Sino-Indian Prime Ministers "will be welcomed by people all over the world who hope to see an end to the conflict in Asia." A commentary in the Burmese "Mandalay Daily" also pointed out that "the complexity of the Indochina issue is threatening world peace. If this issue is not resolved, peace in Southeast Asia cannot be maintained"; therefore, the Prime Ministers of countries "adjacent to Indochina" "agreeing to work towards this goal will greatly encourage the Asian people."

The proposition put forward by the Prime Ministers of China and India in their joint statement: "The political settlement in Indochina should aim at creating free, democratic, unified and independent countries. These countries should not be used for the purpose of aggression, nor should they be subjected to foreign interference." This proposition has been warmly supported by Asian public opinion. This proves that this suggestion, which is in line with the consistent position of the Vietnamese, Chinese, and Soviet delegations at the Geneva Conference, represents the principled attitude of the Asian people towards the peaceful settlement of the Indochina issue.

The social opinions of major Asian countries believe that the results of the Sino-Indian and Sino-Burmese talks convincingly prove that although there are different social systems and political systems among Asian countries and even countries around the world, as long as the five principles of "mutual respect for territorial sovereignty; non-aggression; non-interference in internal affairs; equality and mutual benefit; and peaceful coexistence" are adhered to, peaceful and cooperative relations between countries can be fully guaranteed. The Indian "Amrita Bazar Patrika" warmly supported the above-mentioned five principles, and pointed out that "there is no fundamental conflict of interest between Asian countries," and they have all "suffered centuries of oppression and exploitation." The "Hindustan Times" emphasized that "regardless of the form of government and ideology, Asian countries must cooperate more fully for their mutual interests and common good." The Burmese "New Light of Burma" commented: "The two statements based on the five outstanding principles will be welcomed by all mankind."

Originally, everyone would understand that peaceful coexistence between Asian countries, such as China, India, Burma, and all countries that have suffered deeply from foreign colonial oppression for centuries, should be a matter of course. Especially after the Second World War, profound changes have taken place in Asia. The common and urgent task of Asian countries should, of course, be to seek peace in the Far East and the world, to safeguard the hard-won achievements of all nations in striving for freedom and independence, and to strive to continuously expand these glorious achievements.

Now, Asian public opinion is more soberly aware of where the common threat facing Asian countries today comes from. At the same time as the Sino-Indian and Sino-Burmese talks, the United States pulled Britain together for talks in Washington. Asian public opinion made a sharp contrast between these two talks with different natures and different purposes. An editorial in the "Hindustan Times" on June 30 pointed out: "The New Delhi statement repeatedly emphasizes the need to realize and maintain peace throughout the world (including Indochina)," while "in Washington, the main concern is not to achieve peace in the Far East," but to attempt to plot "conspiracies to undermine the opportunity for an agreement that may be reached in Geneva." An editorial in the Indonesian "Indonesia Raya" on July 1, discussing the Delhi talks and the Washington talks, wrote: "They are completely different in spirit and purpose. The results of the talks between Zhou Enlai and Nehru are a huge contribution to peace." The "Ceylon Times" also believes that the "five principles" are "the most fundamental principles that must be respected," "However, it is these principles that the West is violating at this time. The West ignores the opinions of Asian countries in their Washington talks...forcibly imposes the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization on Asian countries."

Asian public opinion is increasingly convinced that although Asia is suffering from an increasingly serious threat of aggression from the American colonial group today, the era of imperialism arbitrarily manipulating the Asian people is over. The establishment and growth of the People's Republic of China, the establishment of the great alliance between China and the Soviet Union, and the fighting friendship between the Chinese and Korean people have declared this to the world. Now, the talks between the Prime Ministers of China and India, and China and Burma show that the friendly relations between countries are constantly developing. Asian public opinion enthusiastically points out that the continuous strengthening of the friendship and unity of the 960 million people of China and India is an important factor in maintaining peace in Asia. The Burmese "New Era" newspaper confidently cheered for this: "The foundation of a new Asia has been laid," "With the sincerity of all parties and the implementation of the five major principles established in Delhi and Rangoon, Asia may be built into an Asia that is no longer manipulated by the West."

The far-reaching influence of the Sino-Indian and Sino-Burmese talks has not only spread throughout Asia, but has also reached the whole world.

In distant Central Africa, the "Chronicle" newspaper in Nairobi, the capital of Kenya, said: Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to India and Burma "is a pointer to the future development of the situation in Asia." The "Kenya Daily Mail" in Mombasa believes that the Asian talks are of historical significance, and these talks show that "Asian countries have made up their minds...not to allow Western countries to turn Asia into a battlefield under any pretext."

The whole of Europe is concerned about the results of the Sino-Indian and Sino-Burmese Prime Ministers' talks. The British bourgeois newspaper "News Chronicle" published an editorial saying that the joint statement of the Sino-Indian Prime Ministers "sharply rejects foreign interference in Indochina," and the editorial quoted Premier Zhou Enlai's words: "The era when foreign forces could freely determine the fate of Asia is over." Parisian newspapers generally attached importance to the Delhi and Rangoon talks. The Parisian "People's Daily" commented, "Asian countries have proven that they do not want some issues that are most closely related to them to be decided without their direct participation."

World opinion has pointed out that the will of the Asian people cannot be erased, and the great importance of the participation of the People's Republic of China, the largest country in Asia, in international affairs cannot be ignored. A commentary in the West German newspaper "Frankfurter Neue Presse" pointed out: "The fact remains that, whether people like this fact or not, Communist China is a real power...A political estimate that excludes China and its attraction to the peoples of Asian countries is doomed to failure."

However, as everyone has seen, the American aggressive bloc, for its evil purpose of enslaving the Asian people, is implementing the notorious "policy of strength" of hostility towards the Chinese people and the Asian people, and is trying its best to sow hatred and discord among Asian countries, and is stepping up the organization of military blocs aimed at inciting some Asian countries to oppose other Asian countries, and even clamoring to conclude a "joint security bilateral treaty" with the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, attempting to turn Asia into a breeding ground for new wars.

While world public opinion is widely commenting on the Delhi and Rangoon talks, people cannot but notice the attitude taken by the American propaganda machine, which either deliberately maintains silence or tries its best to belittle the significant impact of the Sino-Indian and Sino-Burmese talks, but they also completely hide their inner panic. For example, the American reactionary newspaper "New York Times" published an editorial on June 28, calling the Sino-Indian and Sino-Burmese talks, which were welcomed by the world, as "cold and unpleasant facts," but it had to say that this fact should be "faced" because millions of people have "accepted it" and "believe that the wise and correct course of action that Asian countries can take is to be closely friendly to Communist China."

The reason why the American propaganda machine takes such a hostile attitude is because the development of friendly relations between Asian countries, especially the deepening of the five principles on which this relationship is based in Asia, is unfavorable to international adventurers who harbor the wild ambition to dominate and enslave the Asian people. As Indian Prime Minister Nehru said: The Sino-Indian and Sino-Burmese statements show that "there has been a certain historical change in the balance of power in Asia"; "In the past, for hundreds of years, Asian issues were mainly decided outside of Asia. This tendency still exists now. But now more and more people realize that in the future, it will be impossible to ignore the ideas of Asian countries about themselves or their neighbors."

It is clear that the results of the Sino-Indian and Sino-Burmese talks have given great encouragement to all those who are striving to normalize international relations and ease international tensions; and they are a powerful blow to the conspiracy activities that the enemies of peace are stepping up.

    中印、中缅会谈的深远影响
    冯之丹
    中印两国总理和中缅两国总理的会谈，是具有历史性意义的重大事件。它充分反映了亚洲人民的和平愿望，标志着亚洲各国之间友好关系的新发展。因此，这两个会谈引起了亚洲及世界各国舆论的普遍重视和热烈欢迎，在全世界人民的心中产生了深远的影响。
    印度、缅甸和印尼等国的许多报刊都兴奋地把这两个会谈称为“给世界人民心中投射了新的希望的光芒”的“令人难忘的事件”，“使千万人的心充满了欢乐而振奋起来”的“历史性的会晤”，它标志着亚洲各国和平关系的“新纪元”和“整个亚洲、特别是东南亚的和平与友好的胜利”。尼泊尔政府当局也表示欢迎中印两国总理会谈的联合声明。
    十分显然，中印、中缅会谈在亚洲赢得如此广泛的关心与欢迎，绝不是偶然的。
    亚洲各国舆论满意地认为，中印、中缅会谈的结果，有力地表达了亚洲人民要求在印度支那迅速终止流血，恢复和平，并要求日内瓦会议就这一问题达成和平协议的迫切愿望。“印度教徒报”对和平民主国家在印度支那问题上所抱的“和解态度”表示欢迎，指出“现在迫切需要的东西”是“停止印度支那战争”，并认为中印两国总理的联合声明
  “将受到全世界希望看到结束亚洲冲突的人们的欢迎”。缅甸“曼岱日报”的评论也指出，“印度支那问题的复杂性正威胁着世界和平。这个问题不能获得解决，东南亚的和平就无法保持”；因此“与印度支那邻近”的国家的总理“同意为这一目标而努力，这将促使亚洲人民感到无限的鼓舞”。
    中印两国总理在他们的联合声明中提出的主张：“在印度支那的政治解决应以创造自由、民主、统一和独立的各个国家为目的。这些国家不应被利用于侵略的目的，也不应受外来的干涉。”这个主张受到了亚洲各国舆论的热烈拥护。这就证明了，这个符合于越、中、苏三国代表团在日内瓦会议上一贯坚持的立场的建议，代表着亚洲人民对于和平解决印度支那问题所采取的原则态度。
    亚洲各主要国家的社会舆论认为，中印、中缅会谈的结果令人信服地证明了亚洲各国乃至世界各国之间尽管存在着不同的社会制度和政治制度，但是只要信守“互相尊重领土主权；互不侵犯；互不干涉内政；平等互利；和平共处”的五项原则，各国间的和平合作的关系是完全可以得到保证的。印度“甘露市场报”热烈拥护上述五项原则，并指出“亚洲国家之间没有基本的利益冲突”，而都是“遭受多少世纪的压迫和剥削”的。“印度斯坦时报”强调说，“不论政府的形式和思想体系如何，亚洲国家为了它们的相互利益和共同的好处，必须更充分地协力合作”。“缅甸新光报”评论道：“以五项卓越的原则为基础的两个声明，将受到全人类的欢迎”。
    本来，人人都会理解，亚洲各国例如中国、印度、缅甸以及所有数世纪以来深受外国殖民压迫的国家之间的和平共处，应该是理所当然的事情。特别是第二次世界大战以后，亚洲发生了深刻的变化。亚洲国家的共同的迫切任务，当然应该是在于谋求远东及全世界和平，维护各民族争取自由与独立权利的既得成果，并力求不断扩大这些光荣的成果。
    现在，亚洲各国舆论更加清醒地注意到，当前亚洲各国所共同面临的威胁是来自何方。在中印、中缅会谈的同时，美国把英国拉在一起，在华盛顿举行会谈。亚洲各国舆论对这两种性质不同、目的不同的会谈作了尖锐的对照。“印度斯坦时报”六月三十日的社论指出：“新德里的声明一再强调的是需要实现和维护全世界（包括印度支那在内）的和平”，而“在华盛顿，主要关心的不是在远东达成和平”，而是企图策划“破坏日内瓦可能有的达成协议的机会的阴谋”。“印尼新闻报”七月一日的社论论及德里会谈与华盛顿会谈时写道：“它们在精神上和目的上却截然不同。周恩来和尼赫鲁的会谈的结果是对和平的巨大贡献”。“锡兰时报”也认为“五项原则”乃是“必须予以尊重的最根本的原则”，“然而，正是这些原则却被西方在这个时候所违反了。西方在它们的华盛顿会谈里忽视亚洲国家的意见……强把东南亚公约组织加在亚洲国家的身上”。
    亚洲各国舆论越来越确信：虽然今天亚洲正在遭受越来越严重的美国殖民集团的侵略威胁，但是帝国主义任意摆布亚洲人民的时代已经过去了。中华人民共和国的成立和壮大，中苏两国的伟大同盟的建立，中朝两国人民的战斗友谊，已向世界宣告了这一点。现在，中印、中缅总理的会谈表明，各国的友好关系正在不断发展。亚洲舆论热烈地指出，中印两国九亿六千万人民的友谊和团结的不断加强是维护亚洲和平的重要因素。“缅甸新时代报”的评论信心百倍地为此而欢呼：“一个新亚洲的基础已经奠定了”，“随着各方面的诚意和在德里、仰光确定下来的五大原则的实行，亚洲就可能建设成为一个不再是被西方所玩弄的亚洲了。”
    中印、中缅会谈的深远影响不仅已扩展至全亚洲，而且已及于全世界。
    在遥远的中非洲，怯尼亚首都内罗毕“纪事日报”说：周恩来总理访问印度和缅甸，“是亚洲未来形势发展的指针”。蒙巴萨的“怯尼亚每日邮报”认为亚洲的会谈具有历史意义，这些会谈表明“亚洲国家已下决心……不让西方国家在任何借口下把亚洲变做战场”。
    整个欧洲都关注着中印和中缅总理会谈的结果。英国资产阶级报纸“新闻纪事报”发表社论说，中印两国总理的联合声明“尖锐地拒绝了外国干涉印度支那”，社论并援引了周恩来总理的话说：“外来的力量可以自由决定亚洲命运的时代已经过去了”。巴黎报纸普遍重视德里和仰光的会谈。巴黎“人民报”评论道，“亚洲国家已证明，它们并不想让一些与它们最有关系的问题在没有它们直接参加的情况下被决定”。
    世界舆论纷纷指出，亚洲人民的意志不可抹煞，而作为亚洲最大国家的中华人民共和国参予国际事务的巨大重要性是不容忽视的。西德报纸“法兰克福新报”的评论指出：“事实仍然是，不管人们喜欢这事实与否，共产党中国是一个真正的大国……把中国和它对亚洲各国人民的吸引力排除在外的政治估计会注定要遭到失败”。
    但是，正如大家都看到的，美国侵略集团为了其奴役亚洲人民的罪恶目的，却执行着臭名昭著的敌视中国人民和亚洲人民的“实力政策”，竭力在亚洲国家之间散布仇恨和不和，并加紧组织旨在促使某些亚洲国家反对另一些亚洲国家的军事集团，甚至竟扬言和蒋介石残余匪帮订立“共同安全双边条约”，企图把亚洲变为发动新战争的温床。
    在世界各国舆论对德里、仰光会谈广泛评论的同时，人们不能不注意到美国宣传机器所采取的态度，它们不是故意保持沉默，就是竭力企图贬低中印、中缅会谈的重大影响，但是，它们也完全掩藏不住内心的惶惶不安。例如美国反动报纸“纽约时报”在六月二十八日就发表了一篇社论，把举世欢迎的中印、中缅会谈说成是“冷酷和令人不快的事实”，但它又不得不说应该“正视”这个事实，因为千百万人已“予以接受”，“认为亚洲国家可以采取的明智而正确的行动方针就是对共产党中国亲密地友好。”
    美国宣传机器所以采取这种敌视的态度，是因为亚洲各国友好关系的发展，特别是发展这种关系所依据的五项原则，在亚洲的深入人心，对于怀抱着独霸和奴役亚洲人民的狂妄野心的国际冒险家是不利的。正如印度总理尼赫鲁所说的：中印、中缅声明，表明“在亚洲的力量对比已有了某种历史性的变化”；“在过去，几百年来，亚洲问题主要是在亚洲之外决定的。这种倾向现在还存在。但是现在有越来越多的人认识到，以后，要忽视亚洲国家对它们自己或它们邻国的想法，将是不可能的。”
    很显然，中印、中缅会谈的结果，给了一切争取国际关系正常化，缓和国际紧张局势的人们以莫大的鼓舞；而对于和平的敌人现正加紧进行的阴谋活动则是有力的打击。
