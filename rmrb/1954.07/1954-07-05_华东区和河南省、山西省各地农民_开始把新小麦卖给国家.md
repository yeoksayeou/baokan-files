    Farmers in East China, Henan and Shanxi Provinces
    Begin Selling New Wheat to the State
    [This Newspaper News] Farmers in East China, Henan and Shanxi provinces have begun selling new wheat to the state.
    Farmers in East China are enthusiastically selling new wheat to the state, and local grain departments and cooperatives are fully engaged in purchasing. According to statistics from the East China Grain Bureau, the amount of wheat purchased by the state in the first ten days of June increased by 2.54 times compared with the last ten days of May, and in the middle ten days of June increased by 1.62 times compared with the first ten days of June. Some early-maturing areas, such as the Longyan Special District in Fujian Province, have completed the annual wheat purchase task. Farmers in Anhui Province are selling wheat according to state pre-purchase contracts. As of June 18, farmers throughout the province had sold 157.76 million jin of wheat to the state according to pre-purchase contracts. For example, after harvesting wheat, farmers in Guzhen District of Su County sold more than 150,000 jin to the state in one day; farmers in Liuji Township, Huaiyuan County, sold 220,000 jin to the state according to contracts in two days. The purchase volume in Jiangsu, Shandong and other places is increasing daily as wheat is put on the market successively. The purchase volume in Xuzhou City, Jiangsu Province, from June 16 to 20 increased by 2.2 times compared with the previous five days. In order to facilitate farmers' sales of new grain, supply and marketing cooperatives in East China have generally added grain purchasing stations and simplified purchasing procedures. After selling wheat to the state, farmers have generally reflected: "The scales are fair, the prices are reasonable, and the procedures are simple." On June 10, three women in Qianwa Village, Xuefeng District, Sihong County, Anhui Province, took more than three dou of wheat to the state grain station for sale. Someone stopped them on the road to buy it, but they said: "No matter how much money you give, we won't sell it to you. We must sell it to the state." Individual areas where unscrupulous merchants attempted to engage in black market activities, the relevant departments have strictly managed the market.
    After a bumper wheat harvest, many mutual aid and cooperative organizations and individual farmers in Henan Province revised and formulated grain sales plans to sell more surplus grain to the state. The Victory Agricultural Production Cooperative in Futun Village, Xiuwu County, decided to increase the amount of wheat sold to the state to 30,000 jin. The Zhang Shiyong mutual aid group in Xiwangzhuang Village, Huixian County, originally planned to sell 8,000 jin of wheat in the summer, but now decided to sell 10,900 jin of wheat to the state. Farmers in Huzhai Village, Chenliu County, are now actively drying and sifting the wheat to sell the best wheat to the state. They also proposed: not to allow a single grain of bad wheat to enter the state granary. Farmers in the Yellow River flooded area have begun selling grain after finishing the wheat harvest. As of June 27, farmers in eight townships in Fugou and Xihua counties had sold more than 3.1 million jin of dried and winnowed wheat to the state, and paid more than 2.4 million jin of summer public grain at the same time. Farmers in Xixia Pavilion Township, Third District, Xihua County, sold more than 830,000 jin of wheat to the state, which was more than 290,000 jin more than last year. The 31 agricultural production cooperatives in Fugou County sold more than 344,000 jin of wheat. On June 26, farmers from the "May 1st," "May 2nd," and "May 5th" agricultural production cooperatives in Fugou County sent grain into the warehouse. The head of the Fugou County People's Government and representatives of people from all walks of life went outside the city to greet them, and held a grand welcome meeting. The Yellow River Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yuanchang Township, Kaifeng County, Henan Province, had a bumper wheat harvest this year. From the time of harvesting the wheat, the members were brewing to sell wheat to the state. After the draft constitution was promulgated, the members expressed their intention to support the draft constitution with practical actions, and on June 21, they sent 46,200 jin of wheat sold to the state into the state granary. Farmers in areas of Henan Province that suffered reduced harvests due to disasters last autumn, in summarizing the experience of this year's bumper wheat harvest, recalled the benefits of the state supplying them with a large amount of grain last winter and this spring, enabling them to concentrate on production. Last winter and this spring, 367 households in Tangmaizhao Township, Xiping County, lacked grain. The state guaranteed the supply of grain to them on time. The grain-deficient farmers no longer had to carry bags around to buy grain all day long like in the past spring famines, which affected production. This spring, the entire township saved tens of thousands of man-days invested in agricultural production. Farmers in Xiaotan Village, Yanjin County, calculated: last winter and this spring, the state supplied 70,000 jin of grain to this village. Because the state scales are fair, the prices are reasonable, and there is no adulteration, compared with the farmers buying so much grain from private merchants in the free market in previous years, the farmers are exempted from the exploitation of private merchants worth about 19,000 jin of miscellaneous grain. Investing this money in production can buy 60 seven-inch plows. They realized that these were all the benefits of planned supply, and were very grateful to the government, and successively formulated plans to sell wheat to the state.
    Agricultural production mutual aid and cooperative organizations in Shanxi Province are leading the vast number of farmers to sell new wheat to the state. The 35 agricultural production cooperatives in Yuxiang County have all achieved bumper harvests in their wheat fields this year, with average yields per mu generally exceeding last year's by 8.5% to 55%. While celebrating the harvest, the members of each cooperative also encountered the good news of the promulgation of the draft constitution. Everyone excitedly expressed their intention to support the draft constitution with the practical action of selling surplus grain. At present, 21 agricultural production cooperatives in the county have decided to sell a total of more than 200,000 jin of wheat to the state. The other cooperatives are also revising and formulating grain sales plans. All 7,003,000 mu of wheat in Yuncheng Special District have been harvested, with an average wheat yield of 128 jin per mu, an increase of 8 jin over last year. The farmers are preparing to sell a large amount of commercial wheat to the state after completing the threshing. The wheat sold to the state by farmers throughout the special district can reach more than 110 million jin, an increase of more than 29.8 million jin over last year.

    华东区和河南省、山西省各地农民
    开始把新小麦卖给国家
    【本报讯】华东区和河南省、山西省各地农民开始把新小麦卖给国家。
    华东各地农民正踊跃向国家出售新小麦，各地粮食部门及合作社正全面开展收购工作。据华东粮食局统计，全区国家收购小麦数量六月上旬较五月下旬增加二点五四倍，六月中旬又较六月上旬增加一点六二倍，部分早熟地区如福建省龙岩专区已完成全年小麦收购任务。安徽省农民正按照国家预购合同售麦。到六月十八日，全省农民已按预购合同卖给国家小麦一亿五千七百七十六万斤。如宿县专区固镇区农民收下小麦以后，一天中就卖给国家十五万多斤；怀远县刘集乡的农民，两天中按合同卖给国家小麦二十二万斤。江苏、山东等地收购量随着小麦陆续上市逐日增加。江苏省徐州市六月十六日至二十日五天的收购量较上五天增加二点二倍。华东各地供销合作社为了便利农民出售新粮，普遍增设了粮食收购站，并简化收购手续。农民将小麦卖给国家后纷纷反映：“秤头公道，价格合理，手续简便。”安徽泗洪县雪枫区前洼村六月十日有三位妇女拉了三斗多小麦到国家粮站出售，路上有人拦住要买，她们说：“随便给多少钱也不卖给你，我们一定卖给国家。”个别地区不法商人企图从事黑市活动，有关部门对市场已予严密管理。
    河南省许多互助合作组织和个体农民在小麦丰收后，修订和制订卖粮计划，要把更多的余粮卖给国家。修武县傅屯村的胜利农业生产合作社决定把卖给国家的小麦增加到三万斤。辉县西王庄村张士永互助组，原订夏季出卖小麦八千斤，现在决定卖给国家小麦一万零九百斤。陈留县胡砦村农民现正积极翻晒、筛拣，要把顶好的小麦卖给国家。他们还提出：不让一颗坏麦送进国家粮仓。黄泛区农民结束麦收后，已开始售粮。到六月二十七日止，扶沟、西华两县已有八个乡的农民把晒干颺净的小麦三百一十多万斤卖给了国家，同时缴纳夏季公粮二百四十多万斤。西华县第三区西夏亭乡农民卖给国家的小麦达八十三万多斤，比去年多卖二十九万多斤。扶沟县三十一个农业生产合作社卖出的小麦达三十四万四千多斤。六月二十六日，扶沟县
  “五一”、“五二”、“五五”三个农业生产合作社的农民送粮入仓，扶沟县人民政府县长和各界人民的代表到城外迎接，还举行了隆重的欢迎大会。河南省开封县袁场乡黄河农业生产合作社今年小麦丰收，从收麦打场的时候起，社员们就酝酿着卖小麦给国家。宪法草案公布以后，社员们纷纷表示要用实际行动拥护宪法草案，并在六月二十一日把卖给国家的四万六千二百斤小麦送进了国家粮库。河南省去年秋天因灾歉收地方的农民，在总结今年小麦丰收经验中，回想起去冬、今春国家供应给他们大量的粮食，使他们能够安心生产的好处。西平县汤买赵乡去冬、今春三百六十七户农民缺粮，国家按时保证供应给他们粮食，缺粮农民再不像过去春荒时那样整天背着口袋到处买粮因而影响生产。今春全乡节省出了上万个人工投入农业生产。延津县小潭村农民计算：去冬、今春国家供应这个村粮食七万斤。由于国家斗秤公平，价格合理又不掺假，和往年农民从自由市场上的私商手里买这样多粮食相比较，就使农民免受私商剥削约值杂粮一万九千斤。用这笔钱投入生产，可以买七吋步犁六十张。他们认识到这都是计划供应给他们的好处，非常感激政府，纷纷制订出向国家出售小麦的计划。
    山西省农业生产互助合作组织正在带动广大农民把新小麦卖给国家。虞乡县的三十五个农业生产合作社，今年的麦田都获得丰收，每亩平均产量一般都超过去年百分之八点五到百分之五十五。各社社员们在庆祝丰收的同时，又碰到宪法草案公布的喜讯，大家兴奋地表示要以出售余粮的实际行动来拥护宪法草案。现在，全县已有二十一个农业生产合作社，决定售给国家小麦共二十多万斤。其他的社，也正在修订和制订售麦计划。运城专区七百零三万亩小麦全部收割完毕，平均每亩麦田产小麦一百二十八斤，比去年增产八斤。农民们准备在完成打场后，将大批商品小麦出卖给国家。全专区农民卖给国家的小麦可达一亿一千多万斤，比去年增加二千九百八十多万斤。
