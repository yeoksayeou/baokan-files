Shaanxi Province to Train More Than 60,000 Mutual Aid and Cooperation Cadres
Rural mutual aid and cooperative organizations in various parts of Shaanxi have been further developed and improved through spring production. At present, in addition to 640 agricultural cooperatives in the province, there are more than 320,000 mutual aid teams of various types, including more than 53,900 permanent teams, an increase of 69.08 percent over last year. The number of peasant households organized throughout the province accounts for 58.52 percent of the total number of peasant households. After the publicity and education of the general line, the enthusiasm of farmers in various places to organize has greatly improved, especially in the development of agricultural cooperatives and mutual aid cooperative networks this spring, which has further promoted the great development of mutual aid teams. For example, in the five villages where the seven agricultural cooperatives in Longxian County are located, except for one village where the organized farmers account for 98 percent of the total number of farmers, all the farmers in the remaining four villages are organized.

In order to welcome the upcoming upsurge of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China plans to train more than 60,000 mutual aid and cooperation cadres, including county, district, and township cadres, as well as directors, accountants, team leaders, and agricultural technicians of agricultural cooperatives and credit cooperatives, by the local party committees and county committees before and after the autumn harvest this year. The plan stipulates that the prefectural committees are responsible for training the secretaries and deputy secretaries of the county committees, district committee secretaries, party and league member district heads, agricultural cooperative directors, and accountants in the form of symposiums. The county committees are responsible for training district and township cadres, mutual aid team leaders, and agricultural technicians of agricultural cooperatives and teams. The number of mutual aid team leaders to be trained is determined proportionally according to the agricultural population in various places, generally averaging one person for every 400 agricultural people, of which 15 to 20 percent must be women. Learning content: County and district cadres mainly study the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Development of Agricultural Production Cooperatives," focusing on studying the methods and steps of establishing cooperatives and specific solutions to problems, and discuss and arrange mutual aid and cooperation work before and after the autumn harvest according to the specific conditions of various places; in addition to studying the general line and a part of the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Development of Agricultural Production Cooperatives," the directors and accountants of agricultural cooperatives must also study the labor organization, financial accounting system, autumn harvest distribution, and democratic management of agricultural cooperatives. Mutual aid team leaders mainly study the general line and summarize and exchange specific experiences such as the calculation of work points, the order of doing work, and democratic leadership of mutual aid teams.

    陕西省将训练互助合作干部六万多名
    陕西各地农村互助合作组织，经过春季生产得到了进一步的发展和提高。目前全省除六百四十个农业社外，并有各种类型的互助组三十二万多个，其中常年组五万三千九百多个，比去年增加了百分之六十九点零八，全省组织起来的农户已占总农户的百分之五十八点五二。各地农民经过总路线的宣传教育后，组织起来的积极性有了很大的提高，特别是在今春发展农业社和互助合作网中，更推动了互助组的大发展。如陇县七个农业社所在的五个村，除一个村组织起来的农户占总农户的百分之九十八外，其余四个村的农户都全部组织起来。
    为迎接即将展开的互助合作运动高潮，中共陕西省委计划在今年秋收前后，由各地委、县委分别训练县、区、乡干部及农业社、信用社的主任、会计、组长、农业技术员等互助合作干部六万多名。计划中规定：地委负责以座谈会形式训练各县县委书记、副书记；区委书记、党团员区长、农业社主任、会计等，县委负责训练区、乡干部、互助组长、农业社、组的农业技术员。训练的互助组长数，以各地农业人口的多少按比例决定，一般的平均每四百农业人口中即可训练一人，其中并须有百分之十五至二十的妇女参加。学习内容：县、区干部以学习“中共中央关于发展农业生产合作社的决议”等为主，着重研究建社方法、步骤及具体问题的解决办法，并根据各地具体情况，讨论和布置秋收前后的互助合作工作；各农业社主任、会计除了学习总路线和“中共中央关于发展农业生产合作社的决议”中的一部分外，并须学习农业社的劳动组织、财务会计制度、秋收分配、民主管理等问题。互助组长主要学习总路线和总结与交流互助组计工算账、做活先后、民主领导等具体经验。
