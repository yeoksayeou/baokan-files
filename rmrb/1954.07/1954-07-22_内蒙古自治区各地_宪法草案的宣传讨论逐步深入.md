    Constitution Draft Propaganda and Discussion Gradually Deepens in Various Parts of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region

    The propaganda and discussion of the draft constitution in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is gradually deepening. Party committees at all levels have conscientiously provided leadership. Responsible comrades from the Inner Mongolia Sub-bureau of the CPC Central Committee went to Ulanqab League, Yikezhao League, Chahar League, Pingdiquan and Hetao Administrative Regions, and Baotou City to give reports to more than 81,000 cadres. The League and Municipal Party Committees trained more than 600 reporters before June 20.

    Currently, most areas have launched propaganda activities. In Hohhot, 71 reporters and 1,400 propagandists have been organized to go deep into factories, streets, schools, and various industries to give reports. By June 22, the city had held 44 report meetings, with more than 2,400 people attending. 563 small discussion meetings were organized, with more than 12,900 people participating. Propagandists in rural areas have launched propaganda activities among organized masses. Various places have also used blackboards, loudspeakers, and other tools to conduct propaganda among the masses.

    Propaganda is now being launched in pastoral areas during mass gatherings such as the Nadam Fair, Aobao Festival, and material exchange conferences. At a material exchange conference in the Urad Middle and Rear United Banner of Ulanqab League, more than 1,000 Mongolian people heard a report on the draft constitution. After June 27, propagandists in the Siziwang Banner and Darhan Muminggan United Banner actively launched propaganda activities inside yurts. The People's Congresses of many banners, counties, and cities have discussed the draft constitution and made resolutions to support it.

    The propaganda and discussion of the draft constitution has greatly enhanced the socialist consciousness and labor enthusiasm of the various ethnic groups. Workers in the power generation workshop of the Hailar Power Plant unanimously agreed during the discussion that the draft constitution fully conforms to the interests of the people. Worker Zhen Fumin said: The provisions in the draft constitution are really comprehensive, and even the labor treatment of workers is taken care of. Many workers expressed their determination to repair the No. 1 turbine, which is currently under repair, ahead of schedule, ensuring no rework and no waste of materials. Many farmers said after listening to the report: We are now truly masters of our own affairs, personally discussing the national law. During the discussion, many farmers proposed to welcome the draft constitution with practical actions to improve summer hoeing production.

    内蒙古自治区宪法草案的宣传讨论，逐步深入。各级党委认真进行了领导，中共中央内蒙古分局负责同志分赴乌兰察布盟、伊克昭盟、察哈尔盟、平地泉和河套行政区以及包头市等地，向八万一千多个干部做了报告。各盟委、市委在六月二十日前训练了六百多名报告员。
    目前大部地区已展开宣传活动。呼和浩特市已组织七十一名报告员和一千四百名宣传员深入工厂、街道、学校和各行业中进行报告，到六月二十二日全市已召开了四十四个报告会，听到报告的有二千四百多人，并组织了五百六十三个小型讨论会，参加讨论的达一万二千九百多人。农村中的宣传员已在有组织的群众中展开了宣传活动。各地并运用了黑板报、广播筒等工具，向群众进行宣传。
    牧区各地现正开始在那达慕大会、敖包会和物资交流大会等群众集中的地方，展开宣传。乌兰察布盟乌拉特中后联合旗的物资交流大会上，有一千多个蒙族人民听到了关于宪法草案的报告。四子王旗、达尔罕茂明安联合旗的宣传员在六月二十七日以后，已在蒙古包内积极展开宣传活动。很多旗、县、市的人民代表大会上，大都讨论了宪法草案，并作出了拥护宪法草案的决议。
    宪法草案的宣传讨论，大大提高了各族人民的社会主义觉悟和劳动热情。海拉尔市发电厂发电车间工人在讨论中一致认为：宪法草案完全符合人民的利益。工人甄福民说：宪法草案里规定的真全啊，连工人们的劳动待遇都受到照顾。很多工人表示要提前把正在检修的一号透平机修好，保证不返工不浪费材料。许多农民在听了报告后说：咱们现在真是当家作主了，亲自来讨论国家大法。讨论中很多农民提出要以搞好夏锄生产的实际行动来欢迎宪法草案。
