    After the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Area in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River opened for flood storage on the morning of the 22nd, water had been accumulated above Ouchi in the diversion area by 6:00 PM on the 24th. Since the opening of the gate, the gate body, gate foundation, and dike sections have all been safe and sound. After the opening of the gate, the water level of the Yangtze River at Taipingkou dropped by 1.3 meters. The water level at Shashi had dropped to 43.93 meters by 2:00 PM on July 24th. The water levels along the Jingjiang Dike all dropped accordingly, allowing the Jingjiang Dike to safely survive the second flood peak. Currently, more than 40,000 workers, laborers, and cadres from eight counties and cities including Jingjiang, Shashi, and Nanxian in Hubei and Hunan provinces, as well as the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission and other units, are guarding the South and North gates day and night, and holding fast to the 259-kilometer dike section around the flood diversion area. Jiangling, Jingmen, and other counties adjacent to the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Area have organized a Jingjiang Flood Diversion Support Committee to ensure strong support for the flood diversion work. All 180,000 people in the flood diversion area were evacuated to safe areas before the flood diversion. Now they are writing letters to Chairman Mao reporting on the safe relocation and guaranteeing the safety of the Yangtze River main dike and the围堤 dikes in the safe area, actively finding ways to produce, gradually restoring agricultural production and construction, and ensuring the complete victory of this year's flood diversion.

    荆江分洪区开闸蓄洪后
    荆江大堤安度第二次洪峰
    长江中游的荆江分洪区自二十二日晨开闸蓄洪后，到二十四日下午六时，分洪区内藕池以上已蓄起水来。自开闸到现在，闸身、闸基、堤段都安全无事。开闸以后，长江在太平口水位顿落一点三公尺，沙市水位到七月二十四日下午二时已降至四三点九三公尺。荆江大堤沿线水位均相应下跌，使荆江大堤安全渡过了第二次洪峰。现在，湖北、湖南省的荆江、沙市、南县等八个县市及长江水利委员会等单位的四万余工人、民工和干部，正在不分昼夜的看管南、北大闸、坚守分洪区周围二百五十九公里的堤段安全。荆江分洪区邻近江陵、荆门等县已组织了支援荆江分洪委员会，保证在分洪工作上大力支援。分洪区的十八万群众在分洪前已全部迁移到了安全区。现在他们写信向毛主席报告安全迁移情况，并保证固守长江干堤和安全区围堤的安全，积极找生产门路，逐步恢复农业生产建设，保证今年分洪的彻底胜利。
