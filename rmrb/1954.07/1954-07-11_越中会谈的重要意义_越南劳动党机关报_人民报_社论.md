    The Important Significance of the Vietnam-China Talks
    ——Editorial of "People's Daily," the Organ of the Vietnam Workers' Party

    Chairman Ho Chi Minh and Premier Zhou Enlai of the People's Republic of China held talks on the Vietnam-China border from July 3rd to 5th, 1954. They fully exchanged views on the issue of restoring peace in Indochina at the Geneva Conference and related issues.

    The Vietnam-China talks were conducted in a harmonious atmosphere, and these talks have yielded important results. Chairman Ho Chi Minh and Premier Zhou Enlai discussed measures in the talks that are in line with the current situation in Indochina and the world, in order to restore peace in Indochina.

    At this moment, when foreign ministers are about to continue discussing specific issues concerning Indochina in Geneva, the Vietnam-China talks are of great significance. The talks clearly demonstrate that the people and governments of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the People's Republic of China sincerely hope to restore peace in Indochina and help ease international tensions.

    However, rebuilding peace in Indochina cannot be decided by one side alone.

    Vietnam and our friends in the peace camp have clearly expressed their pro-peace attitude. Before the Berlin Conference and the Geneva Conference, Chairman Ho Chi Minh, in his reply to the questions raised by the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" in November 1953, had already detailed the attitude of the people and government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in striving for peace and national independence. The Vietnamese people have been waging a persistent struggle, never missing any opportunity to strive for the restoration of peace in Indochina on the basis of the French government's recognition of the national independence and sovereignty of the Vietnamese people, as well as the people of Cambodia and Laos.

    The attitude adopted by the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam at the Geneva Conference and the reasonable and pragmatic proposals put forward specifically reflect the desire of the Vietnamese people and government for peace and independence. Recently, Chairman Ho Chi Minh made important remarks in his reply on July 6th to questions raised by the editor-in-chief of the Vietnam News Agency: The five principles put forward in the joint statement of the premiers of China and India and the premiers of China and Burma, namely: mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence, are also applicable to the resolution of the Indochina issue.

    Like the French people, the people of the Soviet Union, China, and other people's democracies have been constantly fighting for peace in Indochina.

    China and Vietnam are neighbors. As long as the flames of war in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos continue to burn, peace in China and other parts of Asia will remain threatened. Therefore, the Chinese people and government have been actively fighting for the reconstruction of peace in Indochina. Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to India and Burma was not only to strengthen the friendship between the Chinese people and the people of these two countries, but also to make the people and governments of India and Burma agree to resolutely use all possible means to rebuild peace in Indochina.

    We and our friends in the peace camp have been actively fighting to restore peace in Indochina. However, American interventionists and French colonialists have been conspiring to prolong and expand the war on this peninsula in order to constantly maintain international tensions and obtain more profits. Because the American imperialists are single-mindedly pursuing war and unwilling to have peace, they have become increasingly isolated. The bellicose Laniel government has collapsed, and the leader of the current French government, who promises to achieve peace in Indochina, has gained the support of a majority of members of the French National Assembly.

    We and our friends in the peace camp are working to restore peace in Indochina. The current French government also recognizes that the Indochina issue must be resolved through peaceful negotiations. This is a favorable condition for an early ceasefire. However, American imperialists are the main obstacle to an early ceasefire. Chairman Ho Chi Minh said: We should maintain a high degree of vigilance against the conspiracies of American imperialists to obstruct the reaching of a truce agreement between the two sides (Chairman Ho Chi Minh's reply to the editor-in-chief of the Vietnam News Agency on July 6th). But no matter how cunning the American imperialists are, the people of Indochina and France, as well as peace-loving people all over the world, are determined to fight for the restoration of peace in Indochina; if the Mendes-France government is determined to break away from its reliance on the United States, implement an independent domestic and foreign policy, and adopt a realistic and reasonable attitude, then it is certainly possible to achieve a ceasefire in Indochina.

    The talks between Chairman Ho Chi Minh and Premier Zhou Enlai once again strengthened the unity and friendship between the Vietnamese people and the Chinese people, and more clearly demonstrated the peace aspirations of the two peoples. This meeting has brought new hope to our people, but we must always remember what Chairman Ho Chi Minh said: Like the struggle on the battlefield, diplomatic struggle is also a long and arduous struggle.

    Under the wise leadership of Chairman Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnam Workers' Party, and the government, with the warm support of the people of friendly countries and the patronage of the people of the world, the Vietnamese people, who are united and bravely fighting, will surely win peace, independence, unity, and democracy.

    越中会谈的重要意义
    ——越南劳动党机关报“人民报”社论
    胡志明主席和中华人民共和国总理周恩来在一九五四年七月三日至五日在越中边境举行了会谈。他们就日内瓦会议上关于恢复印度支那和平问题及有关问题充分地交换了意见。
    越中会谈是在融洽的气氛中进行的，这次会谈已带来重要结果。胡志明主席和周恩来总理在会谈中讨论了符合目前印度支那和世界局势的措施，以恢复印度支那的和平。
    在目前外长们即将在日内瓦继续讨论关于印度支那的具体问题的时刻，越中会谈具有重大意义。会谈清楚地表明，越南民主共和国和中华人民共和国两国的人民和政府诚挚地希望恢复印度支那和平并帮助缓和国际紧张局势。
    然而，在印度支那重建和平是不能单靠一方面来决定的。
    越南和我们和平阵营中的朋友已经清楚地表示了它们的拥护和平的态度。在柏林会议和日内瓦会议以前，胡志明主席在一九五三年十一月答复瑞典报纸“快报”向他提出的问题的时候，已经详细说明了越南民主共和国的人民和政府争取和平和民族独立的态度。越南人民一直在进行坚持不渝的斗争，没有错过任何一个机会，来争取在法国政府承认越南人民以及高棉和寮国人民的民族独立和主权的基础上，恢复印度支那和平。
    越南民主共和国代表团在日内瓦会议上所采取的态度和所提出的合理的和实事求是的建议，具体地反映了越南人民和政府的要求和平和独立的愿望。最近胡志明主席在七月六日答复越南通讯社主编所提问题时发表了重要的意见：中印两国总理和中缅两国总理的联合声明中所提出的五项原则，即：互相尊重领土主权、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利、和平共处，也适用于印度支那问题的解决。
    像法国人民一样，苏联、中国和其他人民民主国家的人民一直在不断为印度支那的和平而斗争。
    中国和越南是邻邦。只要越南、高棉和寮国的战火一天在燃烧，中国和亚洲其他地方的和平就仍然受到威胁。因此中国人民和政府一直在积极地为重建印度支那的和平而斗争。周恩来总理的印度和缅甸之行，不仅为了加强中国人民和这两国人民之间的友谊，并且为了使印度和缅甸人民和政府赞同坚决用一切可能的办法来重建印度支那的和平。
    我们和我们和平阵营中的朋友们一直在积极地为恢复印度支那的和平而斗争。但是美国干涉者和法国殖民者一直在阴谋延长并扩大这个半岛上的战争，以便经常保持国际紧张局势和获得更多的利润。由于美帝国主义者一味想进行战争而不愿意要和平，他们变得愈来愈孤立了，好战的拉尼埃政府垮台了，保证要实现印度支那和平的法国现政府的领袖，获得了法国国民议会的大多数议员的支持。
    我们和我们和平阵营中的朋友们在努力恢复印度支那的和平。法国现政府也认识到必须通过和平谈判来解决印度支那问题。这是早日实现停火的一种有利条件。可是美帝国主义者是妨碍早日实现停火的主要障碍。胡志明主席说：对于美帝国主义者企图阻挠双方停战协议的达成的阴谋，我们应该保持着高度警惕（胡志明主席七月六日对越南通讯社主编所提问题的答复）。但是不管美帝国主义者如何狡猾，印度支那和法国的人民以及全世界爱好和平的人民坚决为恢复印度支那的和平而斗争；如果孟戴斯—弗朗斯的政府决心摆脱它对美国的依靠，执行一种独立的对内和对外政策，并采取一种现实的合理的态度，那么在印度支那实现停战当然是可能的。
    胡志明主席和周恩来总理的会谈再一次加强了越南人民和中国人民之间的团结和友谊，并且更清楚地表明了两国人民的和平愿望。这次会谈给我国人民带来了新的希望，但是我们必须始终记住胡志明主席所说的话：像在战场上的斗争一样，外交斗争也是一种长期艰苦的斗争。
    在胡志明主席、越南劳动党和政府的英明领导下，在各友好国家人民的热烈支持和全世界人民的赞助下，正在团结一致英勇作战的越南人民必然能赢得和平，独立，统一和民主。（新华社据越南通讯社北越十日讯）
