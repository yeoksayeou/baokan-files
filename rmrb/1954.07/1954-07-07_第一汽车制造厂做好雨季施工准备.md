Xinhua News Agency Report:

    First Automobile Works has basically completed preparations for rainy season construction. The rainy season construction measures were suggested by Soviet experts assisting in the construction of the factory. According to meteorological observations, there are an average of about one hundred rainy days here each year. If construction is halted, tens of thousands of workdays will be wasted, greatly affecting the progress of the project. Preparations for rainy season construction began in mid-June. So far, the main projects with open-air construction in various work areas have been equipped with rainproof reed mats and tarpaulin sheds. Many of these rainproof sheds are movable. For example, the rainproof shed for bricklaying can be moved back and forth, and the rainproof shed for foundation work can be raised and lowered. A layer of gravel has been laid on the transportation roads, and many drainage ditches have been repaired. For safe construction, many scaffolds have been strengthened and widened, and a large number of safety belts, raincoats, and rain boots have been prepared for the workers. To ensure the quality of the project, equipment for covering materials in rainy weather has also been prepared. Thanks to the preparations for rainy season construction, construction site 107, which has already fought three battles with the rain, has completed its project schedule.

    第一汽车制造厂做好雨季施工准备
    第一汽车制造厂已基本做好雨季施工的准备工作。雨季施工的措施是帮助建厂的苏联专家提出来的。据气象观察了解，这里每年平均有一百天左右的雨天，如果不施工，就会白白浪费几万个工作日，大大影响工程进度。雨季施工的准备从六月中旬开始，到现在各个工区露天施工的主要工程已搭好了防雨的席棚和帆布棚，这些防雨棚有许多是可以移动的，如砌墙用的防雨棚就可以前后搬动，基础工程用的防雨棚可以升高和降低。在运输大道上已经铺上了一层碎石，排水沟也已经修好了许多。为了安全施工，许多脚手架都加固加宽了，还为工人准备了大批的安全带、雨衣、雨鞋。为了保证工程质量，也准备好了在雨天遮盖材料的用具。由于做了雨季施工的准备，已和雨天作过三次斗争的一零七工地，完成了工程进度。　（据新华社讯）
