People in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River are intensely engaged in flood prevention. Currently, nearly ten thousand cadres are leading six hundred thousand laborers on the thousands of miles of main dikes along the Jingjiang Dike, the north bank of the Han River, the vicinity of Wuhan, the Huangshi City Dike, and the Huangguang Dike in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River to repair dangerous sections and reinforce weak spots. In counties such as Daye and Xishui alone, approximately 1.2 million cubic meters of earthwork have been completed. Honghu, Jianli, Jiayu, Wuchang, Hanchuan, Hanyang, Huanggang, Echeng, Huangmei, Guangji, and other counties have mobilized large numbers of people and deployed a large amount of transportation equipment and flood control materials to actively engage in flood prevention. On the Yangtze River's mid-stream water and land transportation lines, civilian boats, carts, trucks, and ships are working day and night to transport large quantities of mud, grass bags, sacks, wooden stakes, grain, and water pumps from all over the country to various flood control sections.

The people of Anhui and Jiangsu provinces in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River have also entered a stage of intense flood prevention. On both banks of the Yangtze River in Anhui Province, a million laborers and a large number of cadres are engaged in flood prevention and drainage work. At present, a strong flood prevention force is guarding the Yangtze River dikes day and night. Water pumps and flood prevention materials transferred from various places to Anhui Province are continuously arriving. Hundreds of thousands of dragon-bone waterwheels concentrated by the farmers themselves are continuously draining accumulated water day and night. When the Zhoujiawan section of the Tongma Dike, which is vital to the lives and property of the people in several counties of Hubei and Anhui provinces, was half eroded by wind and waves, Wang Guangyu, Director of the Rural Work Department of the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Wu Yunpei, Deputy Director of the Anhui Provincial Flood Control Headquarters, led more than 10,000 laborers to the dike to rescue it, turning danger into safety. Wufeng, Shunan, Xinqiao, Zhongming, and other districts in Tongling County quickly raised more than 35,000 fir trees and wave-blocking piles, more than 1,500 bundles of bamboo, and more than 18,000 bundles of wave grass to strongly support the river defense. Gu Pu, Secretary of the Tongling County Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Zhang Shigen, Lü Banglou, Wang Hui, and other members of the County Committee not only led the farmers in flood prevention, but also demonstrated the noble qualities of Communist Party members by blocking breaches with their bodies during the most critical water conditions, averting danger. Together with the efforts of the vast number of farmers, they protected the dike. People's Liberation Army units in the along the Yangtze River area also joined the flood prevention work. The vast number of people in 21 counties and cities including Jiangpu, Jiangdu, Taizhou, and Nanjing along the Yangtze River in Jiangsu Province have also comprehensively deployed defenses on the more than 900-kilometer-long river dikes and more than 400 port dikes along both banks of the Yangtze River. Flood prevention teams are also guarding the Qinhuai River basin, the Taihu Lake basin, the lower reaches of the Huai River, and the more than 700-kilometer-long sea dikes day and night. More than 100,000 farmers in Jiangdu, Liuhe, Yizheng, Jiangpu, and other counties heightened and thickened the river dikes during heavy rain, generally increasing the height of low-lying sections by one to three centimeters. Nearly 10,000 construction workers, more than 400 college students, and more than 800 commanders and fighters from a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Nanjing participated in the flood prevention work in Nanjing. Commanders and fighters from a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army participating in the defense of the Qinhuai River dikes transported earth from 200 meters away to the dike. As the river water continued to rise, the dike was continuously heightened and thickened, ensuring that more than 300 acres of land were not flooded. At present, various places in Jiangsu are continuing to heighten and thicken river, sea, and river dikes, and are further intensifying flood prevention work.

The Central South Administrative Committee held its 26th committee meeting on the 7th. The meeting listened to reports from the persons in charge of the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission and the Wuhan Flood Control Headquarters on flood prevention work in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River and the Wuhan urban area. The meeting decided to continue to strengthen flood prevention work in the Central South region, especially to ensure the safety of the Jingjiang Dike and the dikes of Wuhan City.

Since the beginning of summer, rainfall in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River has been excessively concentrated. In many places, the rainfall in the past six months has approached or exceeded the rainfall for the entire year in previous years. The water level of rivers has continued to rise. The water level of the Yangtze River in various places below Chenglingji in Hubei Province has mostly reached or exceeded the highest water level in previous years. The water levels in Shashi, Wuhan, and other places are also approaching the highest water levels in previous years. Under this serious water situation, the local party and government leading organs have taken necessary flood prevention measures in a timely manner, concentrating manpower and material resources to fight resolutely against the floods. With the strong support of the Central People's Government and the people of the whole country, the flood prevention work in the past period has achieved preliminary results. The meeting focused on discussing flood prevention work in the Wuhan urban area and the Jingjiang Dike, approved the flood prevention work plan proposed by the Wuhan Flood Control Headquarters, further strengthened the leadership of flood prevention work in the urban area, and took appropriate steps to quickly complete the flood prevention project throughout the city, requiring to ensure the safety of the Wuhan urban area in the event of the highest water level in previous years. For the flood prevention work of the Jingjiang Dike, it is also required to ensure the safety of the dike under the highest water level in previous years; and to accelerate the completion of the preparatory work for the Jingjiang flood diversion, so as to be prepared for any eventuality.

    长江中游下游人民紧张防汛
    中南决定确保荆江大堤和武汉堤防的安全
    长江中、下游人民紧张防汛。现在长江中游荆江大堤、汉水北岸、武汉附近、黄石市大堤、黄广大堤等千里干堤上，已有近万名干部领导六十万民工抢修险工，加固险段。仅大冶、浠水等县就已完成土方约一百二十万公方。洪湖、监利、嘉鱼、武昌、汉川、汉阳、黄冈、鄂城、黄梅、广济等县已动员了大批人员，并调集了大量运输工具、防汛器材积极进行防汛。长江中游水陆交通运输线上，民船、大车、卡车、轮船正夜以继日地把全国各地支援来的大批泥土、草包、麻袋、木桩、粮食、抽水机源源运往各个防汛堤段。
    长江下游安徽、江苏两省人民也进入紧张防汛阶段。安徽省长江两岸已有百万民工和大量的干部进行防汛排涝工作。目前强大的防汛队伍正日夜固守着长江大堤。由各地调往安徽省的抽水机和防汛器材源源运到。农民自己集中起来的数十万辆龙骨水车日夜不停地排除积水。当关系着湖北、安徽两省数县人民生命财产安全的同马大堤周家湾段被风浪削去一半时，中共安徽省委农村工作部部长王光宇和安徽省防汛指挥部副主任吴云培，带领一万多民工上堤抢救，转危为安。铜陵县五峰、顺安、新桥、钟鸣等区并迅速筹集了杉木、防浪桩三万五千多根，竹子一千五百多担，浪草一万八千多担，大力支援了江防。中共铜陵县委书记古朴，县委委员张世根、吕棒楼、王辉等不仅领导农民防汛，在水情最紧急时还发扬了共产党员的高贵品质，以身体堵住缺口，挽救了险象，加上广大农民的努力抢救，保卫了堤身。沿江地区的人民解放军部队，也投入了防汛工作。江苏省长江两岸的江浦、江都、泰州和南京等二十一个县市的广大人民，也已在长江两岸九百多公里的江堤上和四百多条港堤上全面设防。秦淮河流域、太湖流域、淮河下游以及七百多公里的海堤上，也有防汛队伍日夜守卫。江都、六合、仪征、江浦等县十多万农民，在暴雨中加高培厚江堤，低洼地段普遍加高一公寸到三公寸。南京市近万名建筑工人、四百多名大学生和人民解放军驻南京市某部指挥员、战斗员八百多人，都参加防汛工作。参加防守秦淮河堤防的人民解放军某部指挥员、战斗员从二百公尺远的地方把土块运到堤上，河水不断上涨，堤身也不断加高加厚，保证了三百多亩地没有受淹。现在江苏各地继续在加高培厚江、海、河堤，进一步加紧防汛工作。

    中南行政委员会七日举行第二十六次委务会议。会议听取了长江水利委员会和武汉市防汛指挥部负责人所做的关于长江中游和武汉市区防汛工作的报告，会议决定继续加强中南地区的防汛工作，特别要确保荆江大堤和武汉市堤防的安全。
    长江中游地区入夏以来雨水过分集中，许多地方半年来的降雨量已经接近或超过了往年一年的雨量。江河的水位不断上涨，长江自湖北省城陵矶以下各地的水位，大多已经达到或者超过历年的最高水位。沙市、武汉等地的水位也接近于历年最高水位。在此严重的水情下，当地党政领导机关都及时地采取了必要的防汛措施，集中人力、物力和洪水作坚决的斗争，加以中央人民政府和全国各地人民有力的支援，因而使过去一个阶段的防汛工作取得初步的成果。会议着重讨论了武汉市区和荆江大堤的防汛工作，批准了武汉市防汛指挥部提出的防汛工作方案，进一步加强市区防汛工作的领导，并采取适当步骤迅速完成全市防汛工程，要求在遇到历年最高水位的情况下，确保武汉市区的安全。对于荆江大堤的防汛工作，同样也要求在当地历年最高水位情况下确保大堤安全；并且要加速完成荆江分洪的准备工作，作到有备无患。（新华社）
