    Mao Shuncai Creates Universal Drilling Machine
    Shanghai labor model and Shanghai Boiler Factory fitter Mao Shuncai's universal drilling machine was successfully tested on July 6th.

    Two months ago, Mao Shuncai received a batch of different types of flange (a type of part on a boiler) drilling tasks. According to the old method, for each hole drilled, he had to first measure with a ruler, mark with chalk, draw a line, and then use a chisel and hammer to punch a center point. He had to calibrate the center when doing the drilling, which was time-consuming and laborious. At that time, he was determined to create a flexible drilling machine. After his painstaking research and the help of technicians, this drilling machine was finally successfully manufactured.

    This tool can drill holes of different sizes, from two millimeters to twenty millimeters in diameter. No matter how many holes are needed around the circumference, it can guarantee even spacing. Putting the blank on the universal drilling machine and turning it by hand will drill absolutely accurate holes. Not only can it reduce the heavy work of calibrating the center point, but it also completely eliminates the steps of marking and punching the center point.

    毛顺财创造万能钻台
    上海市劳动模范、上海锅炉厂钳工毛顺财创制的万能钻台，已在七月六日试验成功。
    两个月以前，毛顺财接到一批不同类型的法兰（锅炉上的一种零件）钻眼任务，照老办法，每钻一个眼子，得先用尺量，粉笔做记号，划好线，再用凿子鎯头打中心眼，临做的时候还要校准中心，费时又费劲。当时他就决心要创造一个活络的钻台。经过他的苦心钻研和技术员的帮助，这个钻台终于制造成功。
    这个工具能钻直径两个米厘到二十个米厘大小不同的眼子。不论圆周需要多少眼子，有了它就能保证距离均匀。把毛坯放在万能钻台上，用手一摇，就可钻出绝对正确的眼子。不仅可以减去沉重的校中心眼的工作，且完全省去了划线和打中心眼的工序。
