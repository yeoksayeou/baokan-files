    Actively Do a Good Job in the Supply of Agricultural Pesticides and Machinery
    Liu Ziqi
    Currently, it is the season for the spread of various crop diseases and insect pests. Especially due to the warm weather last winter, the mortality rate of pests was low, so various diseases and insect pests have occurred successively this year. Since the beginning of spring, wheat-producing areas have experienced wheat aphid, wheat spider, and wheat blossom midge infestations. Now the locust plague is also relatively serious. Rice stem borers in the southern rice-growing areas have been harming crops in many provinces since March. In many cotton-producing areas, as soon as the cotton seedlings emerged, cotton aphids, red spiders, and plant bugs occurred. In individual severely affected areas, the cotton seedlings have already begun to curl.
    In order to vigorously help farmers fight against various insect pests, most of the supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions have prepared a large number of agricultural pesticides and machinery and are rapidly transporting them to the countryside. Jiangsu, Shandong, Shaanxi and other twenty-nine provinces and cities have prepared more than 69 million catties of pesticides and more than 320,000 sets of agricultural machinery. According to incomplete statistics from Shandong, Henan, Shaanxi and other fifteen provinces in mid-May, more than 4.5 million catties of pesticides and more than 18,000 sets of agricultural machinery have already been supplied to farmers, basically achieving timely supply. This will play a significant role in the normal growth of spring seedlings and strive for a bumper harvest. However, at present, some supply and marketing cooperatives in some areas are satisfied with the quantity of old pesticides and machinery stored last year and do not make new preparations; nor do they study what insects these old pesticides and machinery are suitable for treating, or whether they are sufficient. As a result, when insect pests began to become active this spring, a shortage of agricultural pesticides and machinery occurred. Some supply and marketing cooperatives do not transfer agricultural pesticides in a timely manner, forming a situation of sending an umbrella after the rain. Individual supply and marketing cooperatives in some areas are unaware when insect pests have already spread. Some even refuse to sell pesticides when farmers come to buy them, using the excuse that the pesticides have not yet been unpacked or the prices have not yet been studied. When supplying agricultural pesticides and machinery, they also do not explain the uses and methods of use to the masses. These situations directly affect the timely supply of agricultural pesticides and machinery, hinder the fight against various diseases and insect pests, and affect the completion of this year's agricultural production increase task. These situations must be quickly improved.
    In order to do a good job in the supply of agricultural pesticides and machinery in a timely and effective manner, we should continue to strengthen the education of supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels in serving agricultural production and overcome various erroneous business ideas. Rural supply and marketing cooperatives must implement the policy of serving agricultural production, and actively supplying agricultural pesticides and machinery is an important aspect of helping farmers eliminate insect pests and ensuring increased agricultural production, and is a concrete manifestation of serving agricultural production. At present, some supply and marketing cooperative cadres have a purely profit-oriented business idea, fearing losses or planning for profits, believing that operating agricultural pesticides and machinery is easy to overstock and lose money, so they do not actively operate agricultural pesticides and machinery or make certain reserves. This business idea is contrary to the policy of supply and marketing cooperatives serving agricultural production and is a manifestation of capitalist business ideology, which must be opposed.
    In addition to requiring cadres of supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels to attach importance to this ideologically, they should also prepare agricultural pesticides and machinery in a planned manner in coordination with the state's plan to increase grain and cotton production this year. This year's insect control task emphasizes both grain and cotton, and the estimated demand for pesticides will increase about three times compared to the actual supply last year, of which pesticides for grain insects will account for more than 40 percent. All regions should prepare according to this goal. Since the focus of the supply of supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels in the past has been on pesticides for the prevention and control of cotton insects, the old stocks of pesticides should also be thoroughly inspected and cleaned up in cooperation with the agricultural departments. Not only should we study whether the quantity is sufficient, but also whether the varieties meet the needs of preventing and controlling grain and cotton insects; at the same time, those pesticides that have become ineffective should be cleaned up and properly disposed of to avoid supplying them to farmers, delaying agricultural production, and causing adverse effects. Recently, supply and marketing cooperatives in Shandong Province have inspected warehouses, cleaned up agricultural pesticides and machinery, and purchased a batch of agricultural pesticides and machinery according to needs. This practice is necessary.
    When supplying agricultural pesticides and machinery, supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels should also cooperate with agricultural departments to do a good job in publicity guidance and technical instruction. Because the use of agricultural pesticides and machinery involves a lot of scientific and technical knowledge, it is different from the supply of general commodities. In the past, some places have avoided damaging crops and poisoning incidents due to the lack of knowledge of cadres and the masses. For example, farmers in Xinyi County, Jiangsu Province, used Ceresan to mix seeds, and the ninth district of Rizhao County, Shandong Province, used "666" to mix seeds. Due to the excessive amount of medicine, more than 500 mu of wheat seedlings and more than 2,400 mu of peanut and sorghum seedlings were burned, resulting in replanting. This shows that if the technology of pesticide use is not rapidly promoted and mastered by the broad masses of farmers, it will not only fail to play its due role, but will be detrimental to agricultural production. In order to do this work well, cadres of supply and marketing cooperatives should first learn the technology and understand the performance, effect and method of use of pesticides. Secondly, they should conduct guidance by carrying out field demonstrations and attracting nearby farmers to visit. Last year, before the spring plowing, Fengxian County, Jiangsu Province, selected more than 40 cadres, gave them short-term technical training, and distributed them to 22 insect control guidance stations in various grassroots communities. During the insect control period, they supplied pesticides and machinery on the one hand, and provided technical guidance on the other hand, and conducted large-scale or small-scale demonstration experiments in the field to attract nearby farmers to visit. The effect was good, and the farmers were very satisfied.
    It is also important to do a good job in the supply and repair of parts for agricultural pesticides and machinery. In recent years, a large number of agricultural pesticides and machinery have been supplied to farmers, and many cannot be used due to lost or damaged parts. For this reason, it is necessary to help farmers configure parts and repair them for use. This year, in April, the De County Cooperative Union in Shandong Province organized fourteen technicians from grassroots cooperatives to learn the experience of repairing sprayers, and went deep into the villages to conduct a general inspection and repair. According to statistics from eight districts, 663 units were inspected and 400 units were added with parts and repaired within twelve days. After repairing the sprayers, the farmers said: "The Communist Party and the People's Government really care about the people. They come to repair them without being asked." This method should be promoted.

    积极做好农药械供应工作
    刘子奇
    目前正是各种农作物病虫蔓延的季节，特别由于去冬天气温暖，害虫死亡率低，因而今年各种病虫害陆续发生。开春以来，产麦地区曾发生过麦蚜、麦蜘蛛和小麦吸浆虫害。现在蝗虫灾害也比较严重。江南水稻区的螟虫从三月起，即在好多省份开始为害。不少棉产区当棉苗刚出土，即发生棉蚜、红蜘蛛、盲椿象等虫害，个别严重地区，棉苗已开始卷叶。
    为了大力帮助农民向各种虫害作斗争，现在多数地区的供销合作社已准备了大批农药械，并正迅速运往农村。江苏、山东、陕西等二十九省市已备妥的农药有六千九百余万斤、农械三十二万多架。仅据山东、河南、陕西等十五省五月中旬的不完全统计，已经供应到农民手中的农药有四百五十万余斤，农械一万八千多架，基本上作到了及时供应，这对春苗作物的正常生长以及争取丰收将起重大的作用。但目前也有部分地区供销合作社满足于去年旧存农药械的数量，不作新的准备；也没有研究这些旧存农药械，适合治什么虫，够用不够用，以致在今年春季虫害开始活动时，即发生农药械脱销现象。有些供销合作社，调运农药不及时，形成雨后送伞。个别地区的供销合作社当害虫已经蔓延时，还不知道。甚至当农民前来买农药时，借口农药尚未开箱或尚未研究价格而拒不出售。在供应农药械时，也不向群众说明用途和使用方法。这些情况直接影响着农药械的及时供应，妨碍和各种病虫害的斗争，影响今年农业增产任务的完成，必须迅速加以改进。
    为了及时和有效地做好农药械的供应工作，应继续加强供销合作社为农业生产服务的教育，并克服各种错误的经营思想。农村供销合作社必须贯彻为农业生产服务的方针，而积极供应农药械正是帮助农民除治虫害，保证农业增产的一个重要方面，是为农业生产服务的具体表现。目前有些供销合作社干部存在着一种单纯怕赔钱或为利润打算的经营思想，认为经营农药械容易积压，容易赔钱，因而不去积极经营农药械，不作一定的储备。这种经营思想是和供销合作社为农业生产服务的方针相违背的，是资本主义经营思想的一种表现，必须反对。
    除了要求各级供销合作社干部从思想上引起重视外，还应配合国家今年粮棉增产计划，有计划地准备农药械。今年治虫任务是粮棉并重，预计所需农药将比去年实际供应数增加三倍左右，其中粮虫农药约占百分之四十以上，各地应根据这一目标进行准备。由于各级供销合作社过去供应的重点是关于防治棉虫的农药，因此对于旧存农药还应配合农业部门，作一次彻底的检查和清理。不仅要从数量上研究是否够用，而且要从品种上研究是否合乎防治粮虫和棉虫的需要；同时要将那些已经失效的农药清理出来，加以适当处理，以免供应农民，贻误农业生产，造成不良影响。最近山东省各地供销合作社检查了仓库，清理了农药械，并根据需要，又购置了一批农药械，这种做法是必要的。
    各级供销合作社在供应农药械时，还应配合农业部门，作好宣传指导和技术的传授工作。因为农药械的使用，是包含着许多科学和技术知识的，它不同于一般商品的供应。过去有些地方，由于干部和群众缺乏知识而发生损害庄稼和中毒事件是应该避免的。如江苏新沂县农民用赛力散拌种和山东省日照县九个区使用“六六六”拌种，因用药量太多，烧坏了五百多亩麦苗和二千四百多亩花生、高粱苗，以致重新翻播。这说明农药的使用技术，如不迅速推广，并为广大农民群众所掌握，不但不能发挥它应有的作用，相反的会不利于农业生产的。为了作好这一工作，供销合作社的干部应首先学会技术，懂得农药的性能、效果和使用方法。其次要用开展田间示范，吸引附近农民参观等方法，进行指导。去年江苏省奉贤县在春耕前抽出干部四十余人，加以短期技术训练后，分至各基层社组织治虫指导站二十二处，在治虫期间一面供应药械，一面进行技术指导，并在田间做大型或小型的示范试验，吸引附近农民参观，效果良好，农民很满意。
    作好农药械零件供应和修理工作也很重要。几年来供应给农民的农药械为数不少，很多因零件遗失或损坏不能使用，为此，必须帮助农民配置零件，修理使用。今年山东省德县合作社联合社，于四月间组织基层社技术员十四人，学会修补喷雾器经验，深入各村普遍检查修理，据八个区的统计，在十二天内共检查了六百六十三部，添零件和修理了四百部。农民在修好喷雾器后说：“共产党和人民政府真关心人民，不用去请，就来给修理。”这种办法应该加以推广。
