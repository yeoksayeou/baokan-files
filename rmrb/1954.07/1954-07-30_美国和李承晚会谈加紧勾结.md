Xinhua News Agency, July 29th: On the eve of the first anniversary of the Korean armistice, South Korea's Syngman Rhee, following Washington's instructions, led South Korea's military and political leaders to Washington on the 26th and began talks with U.S. President Eisenhower on the 27th. According to U.S. official announcements, those participating in the talks included U.S. Secretary of State Dulles, Secretary of Defense Wilson, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Radford, Commander-in-Chief of U.S. Forces in the Far East Hull, U.S. Ambassador to South Korea Briggs, and Director of the Foreign Operations Administration Stassen. These talks show that the U.S. is intensifying its collusion with Syngman Rhee to prepare for war, threatening the stability of the Korean armistice and preventing the easing of tensions in Asia.

The United States, in opposition to all countries and peoples who desire a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, has openly announced that the U.S. and Syngman Rhee will unilaterally re-discuss the issue of "unifying" Korea. The United States Information Service cited the joint statement of August 8th last year by Syngman Rhee and U.S. Secretary of State Dulles, reiterating the U.S. attempt to invade North Korea through Syngman Rhee, which "will continue to be an object of concern in American foreign policy." The blatant clamor issued from Seoul the day before Syngman Rhee left South Korea shows that the U.S. is again directing this running dog to make empty threats, trying its best to create a tense situation. Syngman Rhee demanded the "abolition" of "the terms of the (Korean) Armistice Agreement" and the "dissolution" of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission overseeing the implementation of the armistice agreement. He hysterically clamored again for the Chinese People's Volunteers to withdraw from Korea so that Syngman Rhee's troops could "attack the North Korean communists and disarm them." Byun Young-tae also repeated the clamor that "South Korea is no longer bound by the Korean Armistice Agreement," shamelessly saying that South Korea "did not agree to the armistice agreement signed a year ago." Syngman Rhee stated that since the United States had already disrupted the Geneva Conference on the Korean issue according to plan, it should refuse any further negotiations on a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue in the future. Immediately after arriving at Washington Airport on the 26th, Syngman Rhee immediately repeated his warmongering rhetoric in front of a large group of senior U.S. officials who greeted him, shamelessly shouting that for the "security" of the United States, a "clear victory over the communists" must be achieved in Korea.

According to U.S. news agencies, another major content of the talks is the issue of strengthening Syngman Rhee's military strength and massively expanding Syngman Rhee's army. U.S. news agency reports confirmed that Syngman Rhee will ask the United States to provide more military assistance to expand the South Korean forces from the current twenty divisions to thirty-five to forty divisions, and to supply a large number of jet aircraft and naval vessels. The Associated Press fueled the flames by predicting that these demands of Syngman Rhee would be supported by senior officials in Washington. In addition, Syngman Rhee will also demand massive "economic aid" from the United States to support South Korea's increasingly fractured economy.

The talks between the U.S. and its running dog Syngman Rhee are being held as the United States intensifies its provocative policies against China and tries to create tension in the Far East. The Associated Press pointed out that it is precisely for this reason that the U.S.-Rhee talks are "all the more important" to the United States. As many observers have pointed out, after the conspiracy of the United States to expand the Indochina war was shattered by the Geneva Accords, it is intensifying the use of Taiwan and South Korea as bases for expanding its aggression against China. The U.S.-Rhee talks show that while the U.S. is hastily carrying out conspiracies in Taiwan with the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, it is further directing Syngman Rhee in South Korea to threaten the stability of the Korean armistice and is increasing Syngman Rhee's capital for new adventures with more military and economic aid, making him a more insane pawn in the U.S. aggressive policy.

    美国和李承晚会谈加紧勾结
    【新华社二十九日讯】在朝鲜停战一周年的前夕，南朝鲜的李承晚遵照华盛顿的指示，在二十六日率领南朝鲜的军政首脑到达华盛顿，并于二十七日开始和美国总统艾森豪威尔进行会谈。据美国官方宣布，参加会谈的有美国国务卿杜勒斯、国防部长威尔逊、参谋长联席会议主席雷德福、远东美军总司令赫尔、美国驻南朝鲜大使布里格斯、援外事务管理署署长史塔生等人。这次会谈表明，美国正在加紧勾结李承晚进行战争准备，威胁朝鲜停战的稳定、阻止亚洲紧张局势的缓和。
    美国与所有愿望和平解决朝鲜问题的国家和人民为敌，公然宣布美国和李承晚将片面重新讨论“统一”朝鲜的问题。美国新闻处援引李承晚和美国国务卿杜勒斯去年八月八日的联合声明，重申美国想经过李承晚来侵占北朝鲜的企图“将继续是美国外交政策所关心的目标”。李承晚离开南朝鲜的前一天从汉城发出的露骨叫嚣，说明美国又在指使这个走狗虚声恫吓，极力想制造紧张局势。李承晚要求“废止”“（朝鲜）停战协定的条款”，“解散”监督停战协定的执行的中立国监察委员会。他重新歇斯底里地叫嚷要中国人民志愿军撤出朝鲜，以便李承晚军队“攻打北朝鲜的共产党人并解除他们的武装”。卞荣泰也在重复什么“南朝鲜不再受朝鲜停战协定的约束”的叫嚣，他毫无廉耻地说什么南朝鲜“并未同意距今一年前签订的停战协定”。李承晚表示，美国既已按照预定计划破坏了日内瓦会议关于朝鲜问题的谈判，今后应拒绝就和平解决朝鲜问题再作任何谈判。在二十六日刚刚到达华盛顿机场以后，李承晚立即在迎接他的大批美国高级官员的面前重复他的好战论调，无耻地叫喊为了美国的“安全”，必须在朝鲜取得“对共产党的明确的胜利”。
    据美国通讯社报道，会谈的另一个主要内容是加强李承晚的军事实力、大规模扩充李承晚军队的问题。美国通讯社消息肯定：李承晚将要求美国提供更多的军事援助，把南朝鲜部队由目前的二十个师扩充到三十五个到四十个师，并由美国供给大批喷气式飞机和海军船只。美联社消息推波助澜地预料李承晚的这些要求将得到华盛顿高级人士的支持。此外，李承晚还将要求美国给以大量“经济援助”来支持南朝鲜日益破碎的经济。
    美国及其走狗李承晚的会谈是在美国加紧推行敌视中国的挑衅政策和竭力制造远东紧张局势的情况下举行的。美联社指出，正是因为这个缘故，美李会谈对于美国来说，就“愈加重要”。正如许多观察家所指出，美国在扩大印度支那战争的阴谋由于日内瓦的协议而遭到粉碎之后，正在加紧利用台湾和南朝鲜作为扩大侵略中国的基地。美李会谈表明，美国在台湾和蒋介石匪帮匆匆忙忙地进行阴谋活动的同时，正在进一步指使李承晚在南朝鲜威胁朝鲜停战的稳定，并以更多的军事和经济援助来增加李承晚从事新冒险的资本，使他充当美国侵略政策的更疯狂的走卒。
