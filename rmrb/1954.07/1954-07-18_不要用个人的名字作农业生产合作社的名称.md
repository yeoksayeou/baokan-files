Reader's Letters Summary:

    Do not use personal names as the names of agricultural production cooperatives
    Gong Runfan, Sixth District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Kunyu County, Shandong Province, writes: I remember that in the "How to Run Agricultural Production Cooperatives" speech in the People's Daily, it was mentioned that it is not good for some cooperatives to use the name of the director (chairman) as the name of the cooperative. The director is elected every certain period; using one person's name as the cooperative's name can easily hinder the implementation of the democratic election system. Using one person's name as the cooperative's name generally also easily arouses dissatisfaction among individual key members and members of the cooperative. However, this issue has not yet attracted the attention of various regions. Some agricultural production cooperatives have not stipulated the name of the cooperative in the cooperative's charter, and many agricultural production cooperatives still use the name of the director (chairman) as the name of the cooperative. What's worse is that some agricultural production cooperatives have already set their names, but some leading bodies and publications still refer to the cooperative by the director's name. For example, the "Yaokuang Village Agricultural Production Cooperative of Kunyu County" uses the village name as the cooperative's name, but the circular issued by the Kunyu County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party to various districts still calls this cooperative the "Bi Shutang (the director's name) Agricultural Production Cooperative."
    It is beneficial to choose words that the members understand and like as the name of the cooperative. For example, an agricultural production cooperative in Jiangjia Village, Kunyu County, uses "Labor" as its name, and some members say: "We are a labor cooperative, so we must work hard." This is much better than using the director's name as the cooperative's name.
    Editor's Note: The reader's opinion is correct. We hope that leading bodies and agricultural production cooperatives in various regions will pay attention to this issue and change the practice of using personal names as the names of cooperatives. When newspapers, magazines, and other publications in various regions report on agricultural production cooperatives, they should pay attention to the fact that cooperatives that no longer use personal names should not continue to use personal names out of habit.

### 不要用个人的名字作农业生产合作社的名称

专栏：读者来信摘要

    不要用个人的名字作农业生产合作社的名称
    中共山东崑嵛县第六区委员会宫润蕃来信：记得人民日报在“怎样办农业生产合作社”的讲话里，曾经提到过：有些社用社长（主任）的名字作社的名称是不好的。社长是要隔一定时期选举一次的；用一个人的名字作为社名，很容易妨碍民主选举制度的执行。用一个人的名字作为社名，一般地说也容易引起社内个别的骨干分子和社员的不满。但至今这个问题仍未引起各地注意，有的农业生产合作社没有把社名规定在社章里，不少农业生产合作社还是以社长（主任）的名字作社的名称。更不好的是本来有些农业生产合作社已经订了社名，但有些领导机关和报刊却依然以社长的名字来称呼该社。如“崑嵛县窑夼村农业生产合作社”是以村名作社名的，但是中共崑嵛县委发往各区的通报上却仍然叫这个社是“毕庶堂（社长的姓名）农业生产合作社”。
    选择社员们懂得意思而且喜爱的字样来做社名是有好处的。如崑嵛县江家村一个农业生产合作社以“劳动”为名，有的社员就说：“我们是个劳动社，就要努力劳动。”这比用社长的名字作社名要好得多了。
    编者按：读者的意见是正确的。我们希望各地领导机关和农业生产合作社都注意这一个问题，改变用个人的名字作为社的名称的做法。各地报纸、杂志等报道农业生产合作社时，应该注意到已经不用个人名字作社名的社，不要相沿成习而仍用个人名字。
