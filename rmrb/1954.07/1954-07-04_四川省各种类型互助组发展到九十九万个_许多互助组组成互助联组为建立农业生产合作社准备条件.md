    Sichuan Province has 990,000 mutual aid teams of various types
    Many mutual aid teams form joint mutual aid teams to prepare conditions for establishing agricultural production cooperatives
    By mid-June, Sichuan Province had 990,000 mutual aid teams of various types, an increase of more than 200,000 compared with before the spring plowing. Among them, the number of year-round mutual aid teams has increased from the original 100,000 to 220,000. During the same period, joint mutual aid teams have also developed.
    During the period from spring plowing to summer weeding, the Chinese Communist Party organizations at all levels in Sichuan Province, while consolidating the agricultural production cooperatives, generally paid attention to the consolidation and development of mutual aid teams. The CCP county committees in the 15 counties of Mianyang Prefecture trained a total of 8,000 mutual aid team leaders. The CCP Yibin County Committee successively trained more than 20,000 key members of mutual aid teams during breaks in agricultural work.
    Many mutual aid teams have learned from the experience of agricultural production cooperatives in organizing labor and managing operations, and have improved their operation and management according to their possible conditions. In Jiangjin Prefecture, many mutual aid teams have promoted small-scale contracting within the mutual aid teams based on the principle of contracting work and output of agricultural production cooperatives; they have implemented methods such as evaluation before work, piece-rate work, and "long-term plans and short-term arrangements," which have continuously consolidated the mutual aid teams. After entering summer production, many mutual aid teams actively carried out various production activities. Mutual aid teams in some townships and villages in Yibin, Dianjiang, and Kai counties launched patriotic production increase competitions focused on summer production.
    Recently, the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has formulated a plan to develop 18,000 agricultural production cooperatives this autumn and next spring. At present, mutual aid teams in various places are actively creating conditions to prepare for the establishment of cooperatives. In the Luzhou Prefecture, 292 joint mutual aid teams and 170 year-round mutual aid teams have registered to prepare for the establishment of cooperatives. (Xinhua News Agency)

    Many joint mutual aid teams have emerged in rural Sichuan. According to estimates in Jiangjin Prefecture, approximately 15,000 mutual aid teams have joined joint mutual aid teams. These joint mutual aid teams are mostly formed with a better year-round mutual aid team as the center, uniting two or three surrounding mutual aid teams. Joint mutual aid teams have more advantages than general mutual aid teams. They can regularly hold liaison meetings to exchange production experience, rationally adjust labor forces between groups when necessary to carry out more complex mutual aid activities than general mutual aid teams, and can also carry out larger agricultural production basic construction. During this year's spring plowing and drought resistance, four joint mutual aid teams in Nandou Township, Bazhong County, irrigated about 100 mu of dry land by using water wheels, carrying water, and diverting water; in addition, they built 13 river weirs that can irrigate 100 mu of paddy fields, combining temporary drought prevention and resistance measures with long-term farmland water conservancy construction. In Liangxi Township, Pingshan County, 21 mutual aid teams are currently implementing joint mutual aid. Peng Daohe Mutual Aid Team and Wang Xingzhi Mutual Aid Team in Xincun, who live in high mountain areas, have transferred 27 members with full labor power to help the mutual aid teams in the short mountain area, shortening the time for this village's mutual aid teams to hoe and sow corn by seven days compared to last year. At the same time, it is also easier to cultivate key members within the joint mutual aid teams. For example, there are more than 1,600 Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, and activists in more than 600 joint mutual aid teams in Suining and Bazhong counties.
    Some joint mutual aid teams are now trying out small-scale collective land management, jointly undertaking some agricultural basic construction, and purchasing some publicly owned farm tools, thereby increasing the group members' interest in collective management and cultivating an ideological foundation for future land pooling. Many joint mutual aid teams in Sichuan Province now have the conditions to establish cooperatives. In the Luzhou Local Committee of the Chinese Communist Party's recently formulated plan for establishing cooperatives before autumn, 243 joint mutual aid teams are the target of cooperative establishment.

    四川省各种类型互助组发展到九十九万个
    许多互助组组成互助联组为建立农业生产合作社准备条件
    到六月中旬止，四川省已有各种类型互助组九十九万个，比春耕前增加二十多万个。其中，常年互助组已从原有的十万个增加到二十二万个。同时期内，互助联组也有了发展。
    中共四川省各级组织在春耕到夏锄的这段时期内，对各农业生产合作社进行巩固工作的同时，普遍注意了互助组的巩固和发展工作。绵阳专区十五个县的中共县委员会共调训了八千名互助组长。中共宜宾县委员会先后在农事间隙中训练了两万多名互助组骨干分子。
    许多互助组学习了农业生产合作社组织劳动力、经营管理的经验，并根据自己可能的条件，改进了经营管理。江津专区很多互助组依据农业生产合作社包工包产的原则，在互助组内推行了小包工；实行先评后做，按件计工，“长计划、短安排”等办法，使互助组不断得到巩固。转入夏季生产后，许多互助组积极开展了各项生产活动。宜宾、垫江、开县等县部分乡、村的互助组之间展开了以夏季生产为内容的爱国增产竞赛。
    最近，中共四川省委员会已拟定了今秋明春发展农业生产合作社一万八千个的计划。目前，各地互助组正积极创造条件，准备建社。泸州专区八个县已有二百九十二个互助联组、一百七十个常年互助组登记准备建社。　（新华社）

    四川省农村中出现许多互助联组。据江津专区估计，加入互助联组的互助组约有一万五千个。这些互助联组大多是以一个较好的常年互助组为中心，联合周围两三个互助组而组成的。互助联组比一般互助组有更多的长处，它可以经常召开联系会议交流生产经验，必要时在各组之间合理调剂劳动力进行比一般互助组更复杂的互助活动，还可以进行较大的农业生产基本建设。在今年春耕抗旱中，巴中县南斗乡四个互助联组用车水、担水和引水等办法，灌溉了一百亩左右的干田；另外还筑了可灌溉一百亩水田的河堰十三道，将临时性的防旱抗旱措施和长期的农田水利建设结合起来。屏山县两溪乡目前有二十一个互助组实行了联组互助。住在高山地带的田埧村彭道和互助组和新村王兴之互助组先后调出二十七个具有全劳动力的社员帮助矮山地带的互助组干活，使这个村互助组铲地、点种玉米的时间比去年缩短了七天。同时在互助联组内还便于培养骨干分子。例如遂宁、巴中两县六百多个互助联组中已有共产党员、青年团员和积极分子一千六百多人。
    现在已经有一些互助联组试行小块土地集体经营，联合举办一些农业基本建设，购置部分公有农具，从而提高了组员们集体经营的兴趣，为将来土地入股培植了思想基础。现在四川省许多互助联组已具备建社条件。中共泸州地方委员会最近拟定的秋前建社计划中，有二百四十三个互助联组是建社对象。　（新华社）
