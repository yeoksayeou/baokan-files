(Reported by this Newspaper) The wheat harvest in the Central South region has been completed, with a total output exceeding last year by more than 15%.

The wheat planting area in the Central South region this year was over 100 million mu, an increase of more than 8 million mu compared to last year. The total output is nearly 10 billion jin, exceeding the state-mandated planned output by about 3%. Henan Province, the main wheat-producing area, planted over 78 million mu of wheat last winter, an increase of more than 5 million mu compared to last year. Although it suffered varying degrees of natural disasters this spring, it finally achieved a bumper harvest of nearly 7.5 billion jin, an increase of 26% compared to last year, due to timely rescue efforts and appropriate restorative measures such as topdressing, irrigation, and weeding. The 16 million mu of wheat in Hubei Province generally had a good harvest, especially the 7 million mu of wheat in the Xiangyang Special Zone, which increased its yield by 10-20% based on last year's yield of 180 jin per mu. The four provinces in the south of the Yangtze River, which were not accustomed to planting wheat in the past, not only expanded the area this year, but also greatly improved farming techniques, thus greatly increasing production. Guangdong Province planted over 2 million mu of wheat last winter, an increase of more than 300,000 mu compared to the previous year, and the output increased by 10% compared to last year. The total output of 1.3 million mu of wheat in Guangxi Province increased by 70% compared to last year. Hunan Province harvested more than 320 million jin of wheat this year, exceeding last year's total output by 15%. Wheat production in Jiangxi Province also increased compared to last year.

According to Xinhua News Agency, except for individual areas in Henan Province that suffered reduced production due to natural disasters, the harvests in most areas were better than last year. In the counties of the Funiu Mountains in western Henan, where the terrain is undulating and yields were low in the past, wheat yields have greatly exceeded those of previous years this year. Among them, Shan County, which had the best harvest, increased production by 47% compared to last year. Yiyang County increased production by 30% compared to last year. In the eastern sandy areas, where wheat seedlings were constantly submerged by the wind-blown sand in previous years, wheat has also achieved a bumper harvest this year under the protection of the green Great Wall—the shelterbelt. Lankao County (formerly the merged Lanfeng and Kaocheng counties), which has the most sandy land, increased its wheat yield by nearly 20% this year on the basis of last year's unprecedented bumper harvest, on its 770,000 mu of wheat fields. In the middle reaches of the Hong River, the Laowangpo Depression in Xiping County, which used to suffer from waterlogging all year round, produced a maximum of 280 jin per mu of wheat this year on its more than 190,000 mu of wheat, generally 180 jin, and a minimum of 150 jin.

The wheat harvests of mutual aid and cooperative organizations in various places are higher than those of ordinary farmers. Among the 272 agricultural production cooperatives in Bo'ai, Wuzhi, Qinyang and other counties, 269 cooperatives increased wheat production compared to last year. The wheat yield of the 60 agricultural production cooperatives in Wuzhi County was 20-30% higher than that of farmers outside the cooperatives on average.

The farmers of Henan Province, having reaped a bumper harvest, are carefully drying and sifting wheat, preparing to pay the summer agricultural tax and sell high-quality wheat to the state. Many agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams have also revised their grain sales plans, and the amount of grain sold will be more than originally planned.

    中南区今年小麦增产一成半
    获得丰收的河南省农民准备把好麦子卖给国家
    【本报讯】中南区小麦已经全部收割完毕，总产量超过去年百分之十五以上。
    中南区今年小麦的收获面积约一亿多亩，比去年扩大八百多万亩；总产量近百亿斤，超过国家规定的计划产量百分之三左右。主要产麦区的河南省，去冬播种小麦七千八百多万亩，比去年扩大五百多万亩，今春虽然遭受了不同程度的自然灾害，但由于及时抢救，适当进行追肥、浇灌、锄地等复壮工作，终于争取到近七十五亿斤的丰收，比去年增产百分之二十六。湖北省的一千六百多万亩小麦，收成一般不坏，特别是襄阳专区的七百多万亩小麦，每亩在去年一百八十斤产量的基础上增加一至二成。过去不习惯种植小麦的江南四省，今年不但扩大了面积，而且耕作技术有了很大改进，因之也大大提高了产量。广东省去年冬种小麦达二百多万亩，比前一年扩大三十多万亩，产量比去年增加一成。广西省一百三十多万亩小麦，总产量比去年增加百分之七十。湖南今年小麦收了三亿二千多万斤，超过去年总产量百分之十五。江西省的小麦也比去年增产。
    据新华社讯：今年河南省的小麦，除个别地区因遭受自然灾害而减产外，绝大部分地区收成都比去年好。在河南省西部岗峦起伏过去产量较低的伏牛山区各县，今年小麦产量已大大超过往年。其中收成最好的陕县，比去年增产四成七。伊阳县比去年增产三成。东部沙区往年狂风卷着黄沙，不断淹没麦苗，如今在绿色长城——防护林带的卫护下，小麦也获丰收。沙地最多的兰考县（原兰封、考城两县合并），今年七十七万多亩麦田在去年空前丰收的基础上，又增产了将近二成。在洪河中游，过去常年遭受渍水灾害的西平县老王坡洼地，今年十九万多亩小麦每亩最高产二百八十斤，一般是一百八十斤，最低的也有一百五十斤。
    各地互助合作组织的小麦收成，都比一般农民高。博爱、武陟、沁阳等县二百七十二个农业生产合作社，有二百六十九个社的小麦都比去年增产。武陟县六十个农业生产合作社的小麦产量，平均比社外农民高出二成到三成。
    获得丰收后的河南省农民，正在认真地翻晒和筛拣小麦，准备缴纳夏季农业税，并把好麦子卖给国家。许多农业生产合作社和互助组还修订了卖粮计划，卖粮的数目将比原来的计划更多。
