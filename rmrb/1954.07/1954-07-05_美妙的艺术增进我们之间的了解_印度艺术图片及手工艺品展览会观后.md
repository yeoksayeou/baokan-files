    Beautiful Art Enhances Our Understanding
    ——After Viewing the Exhibition of Indian Art Pictures and Handicrafts
    Yuan Shuipai

    The small-scale exhibition displays pictures and artifacts of art treasures from a great nation spanning thousands of years. The thousands of spectators in the capital who viewed the exhibition expressed their heartfelt admiration for the talent and perseverance of the Indian people.

    There are dozens of well-made photographs introducing famous Indian architecture, sculptures, and murals from the 1st to the 16th and 17th centuries. The intricately carved stone pillars, beams, and caissons of palaces and temples, with their extremely complex patterns, fully demonstrate the wisdom and astonishing perseverance of the Indian working people. Perhaps few people, when faced with these solemn and magnificent artistic masterpieces that required decades or even centuries of effort to complete, would not be awestruck.

    Within these palaces and temple buildings, there are also statues of gods and Buddhas, as well as ancient people working and fighting. Whether gods or humans, they are largely depicted by the nameless artists as lifelike and vivid. Their strong bodies, expressive eyes, flowing robes, and soft folds all give people endless aesthetic pleasure. While representing reality, the artists imbued their own distinct ideals, discarding impurities and emphasizing essences, so that the characters' images fully display their kindness and beautiful qualities. It may be a "Buddha," but why can't it be seen as an ideal "person" in the eyes of the working people of that time? That's what I thought when I saw the photograph of the Buddha statue from the 4th to 5th centuries, housed in the Mathura Art Museum in Uttar Pradesh. An 11th-century sculpture from Orissa, "Young Woman Writing a Love Letter," further deepened people's love for ancient Indian sculpture due to its rich life-like subject matter and outstanding expressiveness.

    Exquisite modern handicrafts demonstrate the long and enduring artistic tradition of this nation. For centuries, the people have preserved the outstanding aesthetic sense and artistic talents of their ancestors, exquisitely crafting various ivory, bronze, silver, wood, and horn handicrafts. National culture—like the roots of a tree—is deeply buried at the bottom of the soil. No matter how the trunk, branches, and leaves on the surface are affected by the outside world, it still tenaciously lives among the people.

    There are also many women's clothes and ornaments. There are headscarves as black as night and "sarees" as silvery white as moonlight, reminding people of the beautiful image of working women on the ever-warm peninsula, under the dense shade of banyan trees.

    Audiences will notice a prominent fact: some of the styles and patterns of the plastic arts and handicrafts are very similar to those of China: those stone carvings, architecture… those brocade patterns. I remember seeing a pattern in a rural area of ​​South India last year that was the same as the "Baiji" pattern commonly found in Chinese folk paper-cutting. Over thousands of years, Chinese and Indian cultures have repeatedly exchanged, so that the origin of a certain art form—who learned from whom—even experts cannot verify for a while. It is not without reason that the Indian people like to shout the slogan "India and China are brothers." Our two great nations have a long and close friendship.

    Most of the exhibits at the exhibition are gifts from the government and people that the Chinese delegation has brought back from friendly countries in recent visits to India. Among them are an ivory chess set and a silver-inlaid candlestick presented by Indian Prime Minister Nehru, as well as a model of the Taj Mahal mausoleum presented by the citizens of Agra. The gifts from the Student Union of Aligarh University, received by the China-India Friendship Association delegation to India last year, are also on display at the meeting. These are two large copper locks. If the audience knows the meaning of our Indian friends giving locks, they will feel their deep affection even more. Indian college students said that they hope we will defend our new country and guard against invaders from stealing, just like defending it with such strong locks. The inscription in Hindi on a banner presented by the Bombay India-China Friendship Association in 1951 also expressed the Indian people's deep understanding of the importance of friendship between the two countries: "India-China friendship means the victory of peace and the failure of war."

    Recently, Premier Zhou Enlai visited India and held talks with Indian Prime Minister Nehru, jointly issuing a world-renowned peace statement, using solemn words to affirm the urgent demands of the people of the two countries for peace in Asia and world peace, as well as the sincere desire of the two countries for mutual friendship and peaceful coexistence. Undoubtedly, this document will greatly and profoundly affect the fate and history of the people of Asia.

    Although the Indian Art Pictures and Handicrafts Exhibition is small in scale, it is of greater significance to be held at a time when a new page is being opened in Sino-Indian relations. Let us further strengthen cultural exchanges between China and India! Let nearly half of the world's population join arms tightly for peace!

    美妙的艺术增进我们之间的了解
    ——印度艺术图片及手工艺品展览会观后
    袁水拍
    小小规模的展览会里陈列着一个伟大民族的几千年来的艺术精品的图片和实物。看了展出后的首都成千上万的观众，表示了他们对印度人民的才能和毅力的衷心钦佩。
    这里有几十幅摄制得很好的照片，介绍了印度从一世纪起直到十六、十七世纪的著名建筑、雕刻、壁画。那些精雕细刻的具有非常繁复的图案的石柱、石梁、石藻井的宫殿和寺院建筑，充分地表现了印度劳动人民的智慧和惊人的坚持力。恐怕很少人面对这些庄严华丽的、需要成十成百年工程才能完成的艺术杰作，会不惊心动魄吧。
    在这些宫殿寺院建筑中，还出现着神佛和在劳动中、作战中的古代人民的雕像。不论是神，还是人，他们大都被那些无名的艺术家们表现得逼真如实，奕奕如生。矫健的躯体，顾盼多姿的眼睛，飘动的衣带，柔软的褶绉，都给人无限美感。艺术家在表现真实时，寄托了他们自己的鲜明理想，舍弃了杂质，强调了精粹，使人物的形象充分显示出他们的善良和美丽的品质来。可能它是一个“佛”，可是何尝不可以看作是当时劳动人民心目中的一个理想的“人”呢？当我看到北方省曼陀罗艺术博物馆所藏四世纪至五世纪的佛像的照片时，我就是这样想的。奥里萨省的一座十一世纪的雕像“女郎写情书”，由于题材的富于生活气息和杰出的表现力，更使人加深了对印度古代雕刻艺术的喜爱。
    精美的近代手工艺品，表现了这个民族的艺术传统的悠长和耐久。几世纪又几世纪地，人民保存着祖先的卓越的审美力和艺术才能，精制着各种各样的象牙的、铜的、银的、木的、牛角的手工艺品。民族文化——如同树木的根似地深深地埋藏在土地的底层，无论地面上的树干枝叶怎样受着外界的影响，它依旧坚韧不拔地活在人民群众当中。
    这里还有不少妇女的衣服和饰物。有像黑夜一样黑的头纱，有像月光一样银白色的“纱丽”，使人想起那长年温暖的半岛上、榕树的浓荫下的劳动妇女的美丽形象。
    观众们都会注意到一个突出事实，有一部分造型艺术、工艺品的式样和风格与中国的很相似：那些石刻、建筑……那些锦缎的花纹。我记得去年在南印度农村里看到一种图案，就和我国民间剪纸中常有的“百吉”的图案一样。千百年来，中国和印度两国文化一再地交流，以至某一种艺术形式的来历——究竟是谁向谁学习的——甚至连专家都一时考证不出来。印度人民喜欢喊“印度中国是兄弟”的口号，的确不是没有缘由的。我们两大民族是有着久远的亲密的友谊的。
    展览会上的大半展览品是近年来历次中国访印代表团从友邦带回来的政府和人民的礼品。其中有印度共和国总理尼赫鲁赠送的象牙制的象棋和嵌银腊台，也有亚格拉城市民送的泰吉·玛哈尔陵墓模型。去年中印友好协会访印代表团收受的阿里加城大学学生会的礼品也在会上陈列着，这是两把大铜锁。如果观众知道我们印度友人送锁的含意，就更会感到他们的深情厚意。印度大学生们说，希望我们保卫自己的新国家，谨防侵略者来盗窃，就好像用这样结实的锁来保卫它一样。一九五一年孟买印中友协赠送的一幅锦旗上的、用印地语写的题词，也表现了印度人民对两国友谊的重要性的深刻认识：“印中友好意味着和平的胜利，战争的失败。”
    最近，周恩来总理访问印度，和印度总理尼赫鲁举行了会谈，联合发表了一个举世瞩目的和平声明，把两国人民对亚洲和平、世界和平的迫切要求以及两国之间的相互友好、和平共处的真诚愿望，用庄严的字句确定了下来。无疑地，这个文件将巨大地深远地影响着亚洲人民的命运和历史。
    印度艺术图片及手工艺品展览会虽则是规模较小的，但在中印关系展开新的一页的时机举行就具有更大的意义。让我们更进一步地加强中印两国的文化交流吧！让世界近一半的人口，为了和平，紧紧相挽起臂膀来！
