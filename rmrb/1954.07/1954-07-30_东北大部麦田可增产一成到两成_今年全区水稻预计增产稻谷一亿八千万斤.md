Most of the approximately 1.25 million hectares (1 hectare equals 15 mu) of wheat in Northeast China this year is growing stronger than last year. According to estimates from relevant departments, if there are no unexpected disasters in the next ten days, most wheat fields will increase production by 10% to 20% compared to last year. Currently, some areas in the three provinces of Liaodong, Liaoxi, and Rehe have completed wheat harvesting, mostly achieving bumper harvests. Wheat harvesting has also begun or is about to begin in the three provinces of Heilongjiang, Songjiang, and Jilin. Heilongjiang Province and Songjiang Province are the main wheat-producing areas in Northeast China. The two provinces have nearly one million hectares of wheat. Farmers say that this year's wheat is of good quality, heavy, and will produce more flour, making it a rare good harvest. In Songjiang Province, the average yield per hectare of more than 400,000 hectares of wheat can reach about 1,600 jin, an increase of 190 jin compared to last year, and an increase of 334 jin compared to 1943, the year with the highest unit area yield before liberation. In counties with higher wheat production such as Fujin, Ning'an, Huanan, Bayan, and Baoqing, the average yield per hectare even reaches more than 2,000 jin. In counties with higher wheat production in Heilongjiang Province, such as Keshan and Anda, some villages can produce 2,500 jin to 3,000 jin of wheat per hectare, and general villages also have about 2,000 jin. In all state-owned mechanized farms in the region, the wheat yield is generally more than 2,000 jin per hectare, and the actual harvest of high-yield wheat fields per hectare can increase by nearly one time compared to the general wheat fields last year.
    In order to strive for every grain to return home and increase the amount of wheat harvested, farmers in various places have rationally organized labor and implemented the method of harvesting one ripe field at a time. At the same time, the number of farmers using machinery for wheat harvesting has also increased this year. The six agricultural machinery tractor stations and 169 agricultural technology promotion stations in Songjiang Province alone dispatched four combine harvesters and 1,409 animal-drawn harvesters to help farmers harvest wheat. This not only reduced the physical labor of farmers, but also shortened the wheat harvest period and reduced grain losses. (Xinhua News Agency)

    This year, farmers in various parts of Northeast China have developed more than 31,000 hectares (1 hectare equals 15 mu) of paddy fields. The increased area of paddy fields is about one-tenth of the total area of paddy fields in the region. At present, the rice is growing well in various places. If there are no unexpected disasters, it is expected to increase the production of rice by 180 million jin.
    This year, farmers in various parts of Northeast China have developed small-scale water conservancy projects by utilizing various methods such as intercepting rivers and opening canals, dredging springs, digging wells, utilizing small streams, building ponds and repairing dams, and mechanical pumping, etc. Farmers in the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture of Jilin Province promoted the experience of intercepting groundwater for irrigation. This spring, they built 23 groundwater interception projects, irrigating 298 hectares of paddy fields. Liaodong Province has many mountains, and farmers have developed more than 4,500 hectares of paddy fields by utilizing mountain streams, ponds, springs, and rivers and canals. In eleven counties including Chifeng and Chaoyang in Rehe Province, more than 10,000 district and village agricultural production cadres and farmers with water conservancy experience were trained through mass water conservancy symposiums, which played a great role in carrying out farmland water conservancy. The development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement in various places is a good condition for a large number of small-scale water conservancy projects to be built. For example, in Huanren County, Liaodong Province, 20 agricultural production cooperatives used the superior conditions of unified land management and unified labor use to open more than 60 hectares of paddy fields. The Qianjin Agricultural Production Cooperative in Andong County used surplus labor to develop small-scale water conservancy. In many areas, the promotion of small-scale farmland water conservancy work has also promoted the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement.

### 东北大部麦田可增产一成到两成  今年全区水稻预计增产稻谷一亿八千万斤

    东北大部麦田可增产一成到两成
    今年全区水稻预计增产稻谷一亿八千万斤
    东北区今年一百二十五万垧（每垧合十五市亩）左右的小麦，大部分生长得强于去年。据有关部门估计：如今后十天内无意外灾害，大部分麦田将比去年增产一成到两成。目前辽东、辽西和热河三省已有一部分地区小麦收割完了，大多获得丰收。黑龙江、松江和吉林三省的小麦也已开始收割或即将收割。黑龙江省和松江省是东北区的主要产麦区，两省共有近一百万垧小麦，农民议论今年麦子成色好，分量重，能多出面，是少有的好收成。松江省四十多万垧小麦，每垧平均产量能达到一千六百斤左右，比去年增产一百九十斤，比解放前单位面积产量最高的一九四三年增产三百三十四斤。产麦较多的富锦、宁安、桦南、巴彦和宝清等县，每垧平均产量更达到两千多斤。黑龙江省产麦较多的克山、安达等县，有些村子每垧小麦可产二千五百斤到三千斤，一般村子也有两千斤左右。全区各国营机械农场的小麦，一般每垧可产两千多斤，丰产麦田每垧可比去年一般麦田实际收获量增加将近一倍。
    为了争取颗粒还家，增加小麦收获量，各地农民都合理组织劳动力，实行熟一块割一块的办法。同时今年麦收使用机械的农民也增多了。仅松江省的六处农业机器拖拉机站和一百六十九处农业技术推广站，就出动四台联合收割机、一千四百零九台马拉收割机，帮助农民割麦。这不但减轻了农民的体力劳动，而且将缩短麦收日期和减少粮食的损失。（新华社）

    今年，东北各地农民开发的水田有三万一千多垧（每垧合十五市亩）。水田增加的面积约等于全区水田总面积的十分之一。现在各地水稻生长良好，如果没有意外灾害，预计可增产稻谷一亿八千万斤。
    今年东北各地农民都因地制宜地运用截河开渠、浚泉、凿井、利用小溪、筑塘修坝、机械抽水等多种多样方法开发小型水利。吉林省延边朝鲜族自治区农民推广截取地下水灌溉的经验，今春修筑截取地下水工程二十三处，灌溉水田二百九十八垧。辽东省多山，农民们就利用山沟溪水、泡子、泉眼和河渠等开发了四千五百多垧水田。热河省赤峰、朝阳等十一个县通过群众性水利座谈会训练了区、村农业生产干部和有水利经验的农民一万多人，对开展农田水利起了很大作用。各地互助合作运动的发展，是大量兴修小型水利的良好条件。如辽东省桓仁县有二十个农业生产合作社利用土地统一经营、劳力统一使用的优越条件，开了六十多垧水田。安东县前进农业生产合作社把剩余劳动力用来开发小型水利。许多地区由于推行了小型农田水利工作，也促进了互助合作运动的发展。
