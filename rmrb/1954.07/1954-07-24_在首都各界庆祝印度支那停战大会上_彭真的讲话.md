Comrades, Friends!

The Geneva Conference has finally reached an agreement on the restoration of peace in Indochina. The three agreements on the cessation of hostilities in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia have been signed separately by the representatives of both sides. The representatives of the nine countries have adopted the final declaration on the restoration of peace in Indochina at the final plenary session of the Geneva Conference. Hostilities in Indochina will cease, and peace in Indochina will be restored. The people of all of China and the people of the world are cheering for this historically significant event.

The Indochina War has lasted for eight years, and now, on the basis of respecting the national rights of the Indochinese people to peace, independence, democracy, and unity, the warring parties have reached an agreement to stop the war. This is the result of the long and arduous struggle of the Indochinese people, as well as the result of the struggle of the people of the world. The Indochinese people have waged an eight-year just war for the purpose of striving for national independence and freedom, and for the realization of national democracy and unity. We have a clear understanding of the just nature of the war waged by the Indochinese people, and the people of Asian countries who have long suffered from the disasters of imperialist aggression are also filled with sympathy. The great and heroic Indochinese people, in the difficult days of the past eight years, have fought for their national liberation and for world peace. In the past eight years, President Ho Chi Minh of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has repeatedly proposed to negotiate with France and stop hostilities, and the anti-war forces in Laos and Cambodia have also made similar representations. It was only because these peace proposals were unreasonably rejected by the past French governments that the Indochina War continued for eight years. Therefore, once the French government recognizes that the awakened and rising Indochinese people cannot be defeated, and is willing to seek a cessation of hostilities through peaceful negotiations, the issue of the Indochina armistice and restoration of peace will be agreed upon with the active efforts of the Indochinese people. At the same time, it fully proves that the era of suppressing national liberation movements by force is gone forever, and only through peaceful consultation on the basis of recognizing legitimate national demands can a solution that is honorable for both parties be achieved. The agreement on the Indochina armistice and political issues reached at the Geneva Conference is beneficial to both parties, not only to the Indochinese people, but also to the French people. The Indochinese people welcome this agreement, and the French people also welcome this agreement. According to this agreement, the three Indochinese countries will develop friendly relations with each other on the basis of mutual respect for territorial sovereignty; they will also develop their friendly relations with France on the same basis.

At the same time, it also proves that all international disputes can be resolved through peaceful consultation. A year ago, the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement had already proved that peaceful consultation can resolve international disputes. Now, this truth has been proven once again.

The victory of the principle of peaceful consultation is the failure of the United States' "policy of strength." In order to create and maintain international tension, the United States opposes the use of peaceful consultation to resolve international disputes, and advocates using force and threats of force to conquer the world. Although the United States' policy of strength based on military solutions and military threats has already suffered a shameful defeat in the aggressive war against Korea, the hawkish ruling clique in the United States has not abandoned this bankrupt policy, which will become even more bankrupt in the future. Now, the United States is still trying to organize some kind of Southeast Asia aggressive bloc, and has not given up its attempt to internationalize the Indochina War. The United States has used every means to sabotage the Geneva Conference on the restoration of peace in Indochina, and has fiercely obstructed and sabotaged it in every way and with all kinds of despicable means from beginning to end. Although faced with this fierce destructive force of the United States government, thanks to the desire of the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the French delegation to reach an agreement and their spirit of reconciliation, thanks to the active assistance of the delegations of the Soviet Union, China, and the United Kingdom, and the warm support of countries and people around the world who yearn for peace, the Geneva Conference finally overcame the sabotage of the United States, enabling the Indochina armistice and political settlement to reach an agreement. The warmongers in the United States have finally suffered a shameful defeat.

However, the warmongering ruling clique in the United States will not give up on this. They will continue to use all means to undermine peace and maintain and create tension. We must continue to maintain a high degree of vigilance, prevent the warmongers in the United States from continuing to carry out their destructive conspiracies and activities, and ensure the full implementation of the agreement.

The Geneva Conference reached an agreement on the Indochina armistice and political issues, but on the Korean issue, due to the sabotage of the United States, and due to the unwillingness of the United States and its followers to realize peace and unity in Korea on the basis of respecting the will of the Korean people, no agreement was reached. But this does not mean that the Korean issue has been removed from the agenda. On the contrary, the agreement reached on the Indochina issue has brought new hope for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. Since the Indochina issue can be resolved through peaceful consultation, then the Korean issue should also be able to be resolved through peaceful consultation. For the sake of peace in Asia and the world, the countries concerned should continue to strive for a reasonable solution to the issue of peaceful reunification of Korea. We will continue to fight for this.

After the failure of the United States' conspiracy to expand the Indochina War, it will step up its use of the Chiang Kai-shek remnant bandits to continue to subvert our people's regime and disrupt peace in Asia, in order to achieve its sinister purpose of creating and maintaining international tension. While launching the aggressive war against Korea, the United States occupied our territory – Taiwan, and sheltered the remnants of the Chiang bandits who were spurned by the Chinese people, in order to oppose the Chinese people. The so-called Pacific Anti-Communist Military Group organized by the United States, which is hostile to the Chinese people, includes the Taiwan Chiang bandits, Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, and Thailand. The reactionary rulers of Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, and Thailand have disregarded the interests of their own people and willingly acted as pawns of US imperialism, even colluding with the Chiang Kai-shek remnant bandits to oppose the Chinese people. The United States has recently provided a large number of munitions, warships, and airplanes to the Chiang bandits, instructing the Chiang bandits to frequently intrude into the Chinese mainland, and even indulged and assisted the Chiang bandits in boldly engaging in piracy, intercepting ships of various countries, and endangering our maritime transportation; Van Fleet went to Taiwan several times to discuss with the Chiang bandits how to undermine peace in Asia, and claimed that the United States would conclude some kind of "bilateral treaty of joint security" with the Chiang bandit remnant group. All these measures by the United States prove that the US ruling clique is determined to continue to be hostile to the Chinese people and attempt to subvert our people's regime; at the same time, it proves that the United States is determined to continue its conspiracy to undermine peace and security in Asia, in order to create and maintain international tension. The people of our country must maintain a high degree of vigilance against the conspiracies of the United States. We must unite even more closely and overcome all difficulties to fight for the liberation of Taiwan, and we will never stop until we achieve our goal.

Comrades, the international prestige of the People's Republic of China has been greatly enhanced due to the brilliant achievements of our delegation at the Geneva Conference. Our status as a world power has been established. We will continue to hold high the banner of peaceful policy in the future, and safeguard the collective peace and security of Asia. We believe that on the basis of the principles of mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence, Asian countries are capable of peaceful coexistence, close cooperation, and joint maintenance of lasting peace in Asia and the world.

Our peaceful policy has once again achieved a great victory at the Geneva Conference, and we will achieve more and greater victories in the future. With the united efforts of peace-loving people all over the world, peace will eventually triumph over war. Long live the victory of peace!

### 在首都各界庆祝印度支那停战大会上  彭真的讲话

    在首都各界庆祝印度支那停战大会上
    彭真的讲话同志们、朋友们！
    日内瓦会议终于就恢复印度支那和平问题达成协议了。越南、老挝和柬埔寨停止敌对行动的三个协定，已经由双方代表分别签字了。九国代表已在日内瓦会议最后的一次全体会议上通过了关于恢复印度支那和平问题的最后宣言。印度支那敌对行动就将停止，印度支那的和平就将恢复。全中国的人民、全世界的人民，都为这件具有重大历史意义的事情而欢呼。
    印度支那战争打了八年，现在在尊重印度支那人民的和平、独立、民主、统一的民族权利的基础上，战争双方达成了协议，把战争停止了。这是印度支那人民长期艰苦奋斗的结果，也是世界人民奋斗的结果。印度支那人民进行了八年的正义战争，目的是为着争取民族的独立和自由，是为着实现国家的民主和统一。对于印度支那人民所进行的战争的正义性，我们是一目了然的，长期受到帝国主义侵略灾难的亚洲各国人民，也都是满怀着同情的。伟大的、英勇的印度支那人民，在过去八年的艰难的日子里，是为自己的民族解放而斗争，也是为世界和平而斗争。在过去八年中，越南民主共和国胡志明主席曾经不止一次地提出愿意和法国谈判、停止敌对行动的建议，老挝和柬埔寨抗战力量也都曾经作过同样的表示。只是因为这些和平建议被过去的法国政府无理拒绝，印度支那战争才继续了八年。所以，只要法国政府一旦认识到已经觉悟和开始站立起来的印度支那人民是不可能被战胜的，愿意用和平谈判的方法来谋求敌对行动的停止，印度支那停战和恢复和平问题，就在印度支那人民的积极努力促成下达成了协议。同时，也充分地证明了用武力把民族解放运动镇压下去的时代已经一去不复返了，只有在承认正当的民族要求的基础上，经过和平协商的方法，才能获得对于双方都是光荣的解决。这次在日内瓦会议上达成的关于印度支那停战和政治问题的协议，对于双方都是有利的，不仅对印度支那人民有利，对于法国人民也有利，印度支那人民欢迎这个协议，法国人民也欢迎这个协议。根据这个协议，印度支那三国将在互相尊重领土主权的基础上发展它们之间的友好关系；它们也将在同一基础上发展它们与法国之间的友好关系。
    同时，也证明了一切国际纠纷都是可以经过和平协商的方法获得解决的。一年以前，朝鲜停战协定的签订，已经证明了和平协商能够解决国际争端。现在，又一次地证明了这个真理。
    和平协商原则的胜利，就是美国的“实力政策”的失败。美国为着制造和维持国际局势的紧张，反对用和平协商的方法来解决国际间的争端，而主张以武力解决和武力恫吓来征服全世界。美国的武力解决和武力恫吓的实力政策，虽然在侵略朝鲜战争中已经遭到可耻的失败，可是，美国的好战统治集团仍然没有放弃这个已经破产而且今后还要更加破产的实力政策。现在，美国仍然在企图组织什么东南亚侵略集团，仍然没有放弃把印度支那战争国际化的企图。美国曾经使用一切手段来破坏日内瓦会议关于恢复印度支那和平的谈判，自始至终从各方面用各种卑污的手段凶恶地进行阻挠和破坏。虽然面对着美国政府的这种凶恶的破坏势力，但由于越南民主共和国代表团和法国代表团要求达成协议的愿望以及他们的和解的精神，由于苏联、中国、英国三大国代表团的积极协助，全世界渴望和平的国家和人民的热烈支持，日内瓦会议终于战胜了美国的破坏，使印度支那停战和政治解决达成了协议。美国好战分子终于遭受了可耻的失败。
    但是，美国好战的统治集团是不会就此甘休的。他们必将继续采用一切手段来破坏和平，维持和制造紧张局势。我们必须继续保持着高度的警惕，防止美国好战分子继续施行其破坏阴谋和活动，并保证协议的完全实现。
    日内瓦会议在印度支那的停战和政治问题上达成了协议，但在朝鲜问题上，由于美国的破坏，由于美国及其附和者不愿在尊重朝鲜人民意志的基础上实现朝鲜的和平和统一，没有达成协议。但这并不是说朝鲜问题已经从议程上去掉。恰恰相反，印度支那问题达成了协议，给朝鲜问题的和平解决带来了新希望。印度支那问题既然能够经由和平协商方法获得解决，那么，朝鲜问题也应该是能够经过和平协商方法获得解决的，为着亚洲和世界的和平，有关各国应该继续努力就和平统一朝鲜问题求得合理的解决。我们将为此而继续斗争。
    美国好战的统治集团在扩大印度支那战争的阴谋失败之后，将加紧利用蒋介石残余匪帮来继续进行颠覆我国人民政权，扰乱亚洲的和平，以达其制造和维持国际紧张局势的罪恶目的。美国在发动侵略朝鲜战争的同时，侵占了我国领土——台湾，庇护着被中国人民唾弃了的蒋匪残余，以与中国人民作对。美国组织的、与中国人民为敌的所谓太平洋反共军事集团，其中是包括着台湾蒋匪、日本、南朝鲜、菲律宾、泰国的。日本、南朝鲜、菲律宾、泰国的反动统治者，竟然违背其本国人民的利益，甘心做美国帝国主义的走卒，不惜和蒋介石残余匪帮勾结一起，来与中国人民为敌。美国最近更以大批军火、军舰和飞机供给蒋匪残余，指使蒋匪频繁地进扰中国大陆，并且纵使和协助蒋匪残余大胆地从事海盗行为，截劫各国船只，危害我国海运交通；范佛里特几次到台湾去和蒋匪商量如何破坏亚洲和平，并且声称美国将和蒋匪残余集团订立什么“共同安全双边条约”。美国这一切措施，证明了美国统治集团决心继续和中国人民为敌，企图颠覆我国人民的政权；同时又证明了美国决心继续阴谋破坏亚洲的和平和安全，以制造和保持国际紧张局势。我国人民对于美国的阴谋，必须保持高度的警惕。我们必须更加团结起来，克服一切困难，来为解放台湾而奋斗，不达目的，决不休止。
    同志们，中华人民共和国的国际威望，由于我国代表团在日内瓦会议上的光辉的成就，已经大大地提高了。我们作为世界大国的地位已经确立了。我们今后将继续高举着和平政策的旗帜，维护亚洲的集体和平和安全。我们相信，根据互相尊重领土主权、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利、和平共处的原则，亚洲的国家是能够和平共处、亲密合作、共同维护亚洲和世界的持久和平的。
    我们的和平政策已在日内瓦会议上又一次取得了伟大的胜利，我们在今后还将取得更多更大的胜利。在全世界爱好和平的人民的一致团结努力下，和平终将战胜战争。和平胜利万岁！
