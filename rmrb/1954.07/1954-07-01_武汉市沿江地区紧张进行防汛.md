    Wuhan City's Riverside Areas Intensively Engaging in Flood Prevention

    [This newspaper dispatch] Party and government leading organs in the Central-South Region and Wuhan City are actively leading the masses to strengthen flood prevention work in the Wuhan area.
    Since the beginning of summer, there has been abundant rainfall in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, and the river water has been rising continuously. By June 27th, the water level at Wuhan Customs reached 26.47 meters, exceeding the water level of the same period in 1931. At the same time, due to the high river level, waterlogging could not be drained, and large areas in the suburbs have been flooded. According to past experience, the rainy season in Sichuan is mostly in July. If the heavy rains from the Sichuan River arrive in mid- or late-July, the water level at Wuhan Customs may rise to over 28 meters. If precautions are not taken early, a serious danger may occur. In order to overcome the flood, the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held a flood prevention meeting and issued urgent instructions. All districts have also inspected the dikes, organized patrol teams and rescue teams, and organized farmers to repair and reinforce the city's dikes. On June 27th, the Central-South Administrative Committee and the Central-South Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued a notice to strengthen flood prevention work in Wuhan. The Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held an emergency meeting on the night of the 25th to discuss flood prevention issues; the Wuhan Municipal People's Government also issued an order, deciding to expand the organization of the flood prevention headquarters to strengthen the command and leadership of flood prevention work, and to fight to ensure the safety of national construction and the people in the Wuhan area. Responsible cadres of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Wuhan Municipal People's Government, and various districts personally went to the dikes to lead the masses in patrolling and repairing. All factories and enterprises in the city have also taken emergency measures to protect the safety of state property. The Wuchang Shipyard has established a waterproofing section, built waterproof walls along the river, and sent special personnel to patrol along the river. The No. 5 Power Plant of the Wuhan Electric Power Bureau has inspected all flood prevention equipment and installed water pumps. More than 200 workers from the Hanyang Transportation Company and workers from the Wufeng Flour Mill selflessly helped the Hanyang No. 1 Warehouse transfer 110,000 catties of grain to a safe place.
    In order to help Wuhan City drain waterlogging in the urban area, the Ministry of Water Resources of the Central People's Government has allocated more than 8,100 horsepower of water pumps and some water pipes. By June 29th, more than 5,290 horsepower of water pumps had been transported to Wuhan, and the remaining 2,800 horsepower of water pumps could be delivered by July 1st. This will provide strong support for Wuhan's flood control and drainage work.

    武汉市沿江地区紧张进行防汛
    【本报讯】中南区和武汉市党、政领导机关，积极领导群众加强武汉地区的防汛工作。
    入夏以来，长江中游地带多雨，江水不断上涨，到六月二十七日，武汉关水位已达二十六点四七公尺，超过一九三一年同期水位，同时由于江河水位较高，渍水未能排出，市郊广大地区已渍水成灾。根据历年经验，四川雨季多在七月，如果在七月中旬或下旬川江大水到来，武汉关水位将有升到二十八公尺以上之可能。若不及早防范，可能发生严重的危险。为了战胜洪水，中共武汉市委曾召开防汛会议并发出紧急指示，各区也都检查了堤防，组织了巡堤队和抢救队，并组织农民对市区堤防进行了修补和加固。六月二十七日，中南行政委员会和中共中央中南局已为加强武汉防汛工作发出了通知。中共武汉市委员会在二十五日夜召开紧急会议，讨论防汛问题；武汉市人民政府也发布命令，决定扩大防汛指挥部的组织，以加强防汛工作的指挥和领导，为确保武汉地区国家建设和人民的安全而斗争。中共武汉市委、武汉市人民政府和各区负责干部都亲赴堤防，领导群众巡查和抢修。市内各工厂企业也都采取紧急措施，以保护国家财产的安全。武昌造船厂已成立防水工段，并做好沿江防水墙，派出专人在沿江一带巡逻。武汉电业局第五发电厂已检查了所有防汛设备，安装了抽水机。汉阳搬运公司二百多搬运工人和五丰面粉厂工人，奋不顾身地帮助汉阳第一仓库把十一万斤粮食转移了地方。
    中央人民政府水利部为了帮助武汉市排除市区渍水，共调拨去八千一百多马力的抽水机和部分抽水管。在六月二十九日以前已运去武汉的抽水机有五千二百九十多马力，其余二千八百多马力的抽水机可在七月一日全部运到。这对武汉市的防洪排渍工作，将起着有力的支援作用。
