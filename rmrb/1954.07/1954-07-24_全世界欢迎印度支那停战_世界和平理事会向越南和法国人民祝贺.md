Xinhua News Agency, July 23rd, Vienna dispatch: The Secretariat of the World Peace Council has sent a telegram to the Vietnam Committee for the Defense of World Peace regarding the signing of the agreements on the restoration of peace in Indochina.

The telegram stated: We congratulate you and warmly celebrate the signing of the armistice agreements, which will end the war that has been waged for many years on the territories of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. We congratulate these agreements, the achievement of which is the result of a long struggle for the victory of the negotiation approach. This is a common victory for all peace-loving forces. The telegram concluded by emphasizing that the success of the Geneva Conference is an important step towards easing international tensions.

Xinhua News Agency, July 23rd, Prague dispatch: The Secretariat of the World Peace Council sent a telegram to the French National Peace Council on July 21st, congratulating them on achieving the armistice in Indochina. The telegram is as follows:

At this time when the armistice agreement has been signed in Geneva, we salute you and warmly congratulate you. The armistice agreement ends nearly eight years of painful and cruel war in Indochina. We salute and congratulate the achievement of the agreement as a victory for all forces of peace.

This victory confirms that despite all difficulties and obstacles, it is possible to resolve issues peacefully through negotiations, provided that they are conducted with the sincerity of reaching an agreement.

The actions of the French peace movement strongly promoted and developed broad French public opinion, which embodied the irresistible force in favor of negotiations and thus achieving an agreement. This action, and the concerted action of all other forces for peace, greatly contributed to facilitating the peaceful resolution of this war, the continuation and expansion of which would have constituted a great threat to world peace.

This victory marks an important step on the road towards easing international tensions and peaceful coexistence between peoples. This victory also encourages the continued efforts to consolidate peace in Asia without being undermined, and to ensure peace in Europe by resolving the German question peacefully on the basis of respecting sovereignty and independence and ensuring the security of all countries.
      French General Confederation of Labor

The French newspaper "l'Humanité" published on July 21st a declaration from the Executive Bureau of the French General Confederation of Labor. The declaration stated: "The ceasefire in Indochina has been decided in Geneva. This is the victory of the struggle, led by the working class for many years, demanding an end to the war in Vietnam. This is the glory of the French workers. For a long time, the French workers carried on this struggle alone, carrying it through to the end."

After mentioning the honor and glory of the dockworkers, sailors, railway workers, all industrial workers, and the men and women heroes who fought for peace, the declaration stated that the Executive Bureau of the French General Confederation of Labor, on behalf of the French working class and the French people, expressed gratification and extended warm, fraternal congratulations to the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor and all the Vietnamese people.

The declaration went on to say: "The Executive Bureau of the French General Confederation of Labor emphasizes that the ceasefire in Indochina will greatly help to promote the relaxation of international tensions… It is deeply convinced that workers and all defenders of peace will act to make the ceasefire a lasting peace, to ensure that the obligations stipulated in the agreement are respected, and to achieve a union of friendship with a unified, independent Vietnam – which can choose its own government and system. The Executive Bureau solemnly declares: Continuing and expanding this action to safeguard peace in Europe and the world is also imperative."

The declaration finally called for action: 1. Oppose the European Defense Community, strive for a negotiated solution to the German question, and establish collective security for all countries in Europe; 2. No more nuclear war tests, prohibit nuclear weapons, and seek a fair and reasonable disarmament agreement.
      French Newspapers

All Parisian newspapers on July 21st announced the conclusion of the Indochina armistice agreement on the front page with huge headlines, and published commentaries on this historic event.

"l'Humanité" published on the front page a statement from the French Communist Party and a statement made by Jacques Duclos, Secretary of the French Communist Party, to Agence France-Presse. Duclos's statement called on the people of Paris to hold a grand rally on the 22nd with the slogan: "After the people's victory on the Indochina ceasefire issue, billions of francs must be used to meet the needs of the working class and the working masses, and they must reject the European Defense Community, which would revive German militarism."

Pierre Goudard, a "l'Humanité" reporter in a Geneva dispatch, wrote: "This great news makes millions of people's hearts rejoice. We have the right to be proud. We have the right to be happy." In talking about the need to remain vigilant in order to defend this great victory brought about by the policy of peaceful coexistence, Goudard said: "This peace of friendship and goodwill that the Vietnamese people offer us must not be undermined or hindered by ideas that attempt to restore colonialism. … The silence on the battlefield alone is not enough. If we want this situation to continue, we must seek a quick and permanent solution to the main problems that separate European and Asian countries. We must end the absurd exclusion of the People's China, which has just played its role as a country of peace in Geneva together with the Soviet Union. We must end the blackmail policy that threatens Europe with the rearmament of a revanchist Germany. We must end the sinful theory that countries with different systems cannot coexist on the basis of mutual respect for independence."

The editorial of "Libération" said: "Peace has finally won. This is a victory that no despicable conspiracy at the last minute could stop. This is a real and great victory of which we have the right to be proud. For many years, we have not had the opportunity to celebrate such a success—a success that contributes equally to the cause of France and the cause of humanity.

The determination to end the war was born in the hearts of the French people, strengthened, and finally won."

"Libération" finally said: France should now take on the great and noble task of solving the European problem.
      "Le Monde" wrote an editorial entitled "The Hope of Peace, the Revival of France": The cessation of hostilities in Indochina is a prerequisite for the revival and independence of all of France. "Le Monde" said that the advantage of Geneva is that it replaced the antagonism between interests and doctrines with the principle of peaceful competition. "Le Monde" then said: "It is meaningless to guarantee peaceful coexistence in Southeast Asia if the Cold War continues and worsens in Europe. The one question that overwhelms all other questions now is: Will Germany rearm? If it does rearm, who will benefit? Since 1950, the US government has been trying to undermine the alliance and benefit Germany."

The editorial of "Combat" welcomed the news of the Indochina armistice agreement, believing that it was the best news since the liberation of France. "After eight years, reason has triumphed over illusion and blindness in France."
    Korean Newspapers
The major Korean newspapers published editorials warmly welcoming the signing of the Indochina armistice agreement.

The "Rodong Sinmun" published an editorial on the 22nd entitled "Another Victory for the Forces of Peace and Democracy." The editorial said that although the Geneva Conference was unable to complete all of its tasks, it achieved important results thanks to the great efforts of the countries in the democratic camp. Although the US imperialists disrupted the discussion of the Korean issue at the Geneva Conference, they were unable to stop the restoration of peace in Indochina.

The editorial pointed out that the restoration of peace in Indochina is a new blow to the imperialists' policy of aggression in the Far East. The US imperialists are trying to keep the Korean armistice in an unstable state. If the US imperialists do not learn any lessons and create new adventures, they will suffer even more disastrous defeats.

The "Democratic Korea" published an editorial entitled "The Cessation of the Indochina War is a Great Victory for the Peaceful and Democratic Camp," saying:

The ceasefire in Indochina provides another example of resolving international disputes through consultation. The US imperialists' argument that "consultation is useless" has been shattered.

The editorial said that the signing of the Indochina armistice agreement further strengthened the fighting spirit of the Korean people, who are struggling for the peaceful reunification of their motherland. With the strong support of the forces of peace and democracy in Asia and the world, the Korean people must achieve the great cause of peaceful reunification of their motherland.
    Indonesian Communist Party General Secretary Aidit

The General Secretary of the Indonesian Communist Party, Aidit, told the press on the 22nd that the Indochina armistice agreement was a great victory for the principle of consultation over the principle of war. This victory for the cause of peace is in line with the wishes of the Indonesian people, and therefore it has been warmly welcomed.

Aidit said: "Our task now is to expand the victory that has already been won. For Indonesia, the development of the cause of peace after the Geneva Conference will directly help our struggle to recover West Irian into Indonesian territory, dissolve the Dutch-Indonesian Federation, and abolish the Round Table Conference agreements."
    Japanese Communist Party Central Guidance Department Chairman, Masami Kasuga

Masami Kasuga, Chairman of the Central Guidance Department of the Japanese Communist Party, made a statement on the 21st regarding the Geneva Conference reaching an agreement on the Indochina armistice and the restoration of peace.

Masami Kasuga said: The achievement of the Indochina armistice agreement is a great failure of the US warmongering policy; at the same time, it proves the strength of the forces of peace. This event has great significance.

Masami Kasuga pointed out: In the future, the United States will still go against the trend of history and use military methods to expand its power. For this purpose, the United States is paying special attention to Japan, wanting to force Japan to step up its rearmament. However, the Japanese people will no longer tolerate the implementation of the rearmament policy; the people will consciously raise the struggle for national independence and peace.
      Indian Newspapers

The Delhi newspapers on the 22nd generally published commentaries welcoming the signing of the Indochina armistice agreement.

The political reporter of the "Times of India" said: "The ceasefire in Indochina is the victory of the will for peace over war. This is the victory of brave and patient negotiations." The reporter pointed out that in the negotiations, "the United States chose a nearly hysterical fear and distrust and stood aside. … The success of the conference caught them off guard and left them at a loss." The reporter also pointed out that China's prestige has greatly increased after this conference. Allowing China to enter the United Nations would be a better guarantee of peace in Asia than the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.

The "Hindustan Standard" pointed out in an editorial that the Indochina armistice "is a great comfort not only to the people of Indochina, but also to the people of other countries in Southeast Asia and the people of France, because after seven years of painful and cruel war, it has finally been stopped by peaceful consultation. The spirit of coexistence has implicitly permeated international negotiations. … The US insistence on establishing a Southeast Asia Treaty Organization with ‘military power’ now seems even more unreasonable than in the past."
      The "Hindustan Times" reporter said: "This extraordinary event of achieving peace through consultation rather than through war is not only a good sign for peace in Asia, but also a good sign for promoting future understanding and cooperation between the East and the West."

The Hindi-language "Hindustan" wrote in an editorial: "The Geneva Conference has proven that no matter how complicated the issue, if both parties are determined, the issue can be resolved through common consultation. The most complicated problems can also be solved through negotiations at the table rather than through the battlefield."
      British Newspapers

British newspapers welcomed the news of the Indochina armistice agreement reached at the Geneva Conference. Some newspapers pointed out that the resolution of the Indochina issue opened up a path for the resolution of other issues in the world.

The "Daily Worker" said that the armistice agreement not only ended the killing in Indochina, but also avoided the danger of a world war. The newspaper said: "This victory for peace must become a bridge to achieve greater success. An agreement must also be reached on European issues, especially on the future of Germany. The countries that reached a solution on the Indochina issue can also reach a solution on the European issue. The British people must insist that their government make a major contribution to this end."

The "Daily Herald" editorial believed that the Indochina armistice agreement was a victory for peace. It said: "When the spirit of consultation prevails, let the politicians act. The Geneva Conference can serve as an indicator of the path towards the real peace desired by billions of people in the world."

The "Birmingham Post" editorial said that, in any case, the terms of the agreement "are a fair solution to difficult problems."

The "Manchester Guardian" editorial said, "What is known so far is only the general situation, not the detailed details. However, this general situation creates a pleasant impression."

The "Yorkshire Post" also acknowledged on the 22nd that the nine-nation declaration on the Indochina issue does seem to lay the foundation for peaceful coexistence in Southeast Asia. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    全世界欢迎印度支那停战
    世界和平理事会向越南和法国人民祝贺
    【新华社二十三日讯】据塔斯社维也纳二十三日讯：世界和平理事会书记处就恢复印度支那和平各项协定的签订致电越南保卫世界和平委员会。
    电文说：我们向你们致贺，热烈庆祝停战协定的签字，这些协定的签字将结束在越南、寮国和高棉领土上进行了许多年的战争。我们祝贺这些协定，这些协定的达成是由于为谈判方式的胜利而长期努力奋斗的结果。这是一切爱好和平的力量的共同胜利。电文最后强调说，日内瓦会议的成功是向缓和国际紧张局势迈进的重要一步。
  【新华社布拉格二十三日电】世界和平理事会书记处在七月二十一日致电法国全国和平理事会，祝贺在印度支那获致停战。电文如下：
    在这停战协定已经在日内瓦签字的时候，我们向你们致敬并热烈祝贺。停战协定结束了将近八年的痛苦而残酷的印度支那战争。我们把协定的达成作为一切和平力量的胜利而致敬祝贺。
    这一胜利证实：尽管有种种困难和障碍，只要以达成协议的诚意来进行谈判，通过和平方式解决问题是可能的。
    法国和平运动的行动强有力地促成并发展了广泛的法国舆论，这种舆论体现了赞成谈判、从而获致协定的不可抗拒的力量。这种行动和所有其他和平力量的同心协力的行动，大大有助于促成这个战争的和平解决。而这个战争的继续和扩大是会构成对世界和平的极大的威胁的。
    这一次胜利标志着走向缓和国际局势和各国人民之间和平共处的道路上的一个重要步骤，这个胜利同时也鼓舞人们继续努力以使和平在亚洲得以巩固而不致被破坏，并使欧洲的和平得到保证，保证的办法就是在尊重主权和独立并确保各国的安全的基础上通过和平方式解决德国问题。
      法国总工会
    法国“人道报”二十一日刊载了法国总工会执行局的一篇宣言。宣言说：“印度支那停火已经在日内瓦决定了。这是好多年来由工人阶级领导的要求结束越南战争的斗争的胜利。这是法国工人的光荣。长时期以来，法国工人单独进行这一斗争，把斗争进行到底。”
    在谈到码头工人、海员、铁路工人、一切产业工人以及为和平而斗争的男女英雄的荣誉和光荣之后，宣言说，法国总工会执行局代表法国工人阶级和法国人民表示欣慰，向越南总工会和全体越南人民致热烈的、兄弟般的祝贺。
    宣言接着说：“法国总工会执行局强调指出：印度支那的停火将大大有助于促使国际紧张局势的缓和……它深信工人和所有和平保卫者将通过行动来使停火变成持久的和平，以保证协定中规定的各项义务得到尊重，并使和一个统一、独立的越南——它可以选择它自己的政府和制度——的友谊的联合得以实现。执行局庄严地宣布：继续和扩大这种行动，以保障欧洲和全世界的和平，也是刻不容缓的。”
    宣言最后要求采取行动：一、反对欧洲防务集团，力争通过谈判解决德国问题，并为欧洲的所有国家建立集体安全；二、不再进行原子战争的试验，禁止原子武器并谋求公平合理的裁军协议。
      法国报纸
    二十一日的巴黎所有报纸都在第一版上以巨大标题宣布印度支那停战协定的缔结，并对这个历史性事件发表了评论。
    “人道报”在第一版上刊载了法国共产党的声明和法国共产党书记雅克·杜克洛对法新社发表的一篇声明。杜克洛的声明号召巴黎人民在二十二日举行一次盛大集会，会议的口号是：“人民在印度支那停火问题上取得胜利后，数十亿的法郎必须用来满足工人阶级和劳动群众的需要，必须使他们拒绝会使德国军国主义复活的欧洲防务集团”。
    “人道报”记者皮埃尔·古达德在日内瓦通讯中写道：“这一伟大的消息使千百万人民心中欢腾起来。我们有权利引以自豪。我们有权利高兴。”古达德在谈到必须保持警惕以保卫这个由和平共处政策带来的伟大胜利时说：“必须使越南人民向我们提出的这个友谊和交好的和平不为企图恢复殖民主义的思想所破坏或阻挠。……单单战场上的沉寂是不够的。假如我们要这种状况继续下去，我们必须尽速寻求一劳永逸的办法来解决使欧洲和亚洲国家发生隔阂的主要问题。我们必须结束荒谬地排斥人民中国的局面，人民中国刚刚在日内瓦和苏联一道，发挥了它作为和平国家的作用。我们必须结束使欧洲面临复仇主义的德国重新武装起来的威胁的讹诈政策。我们必须结束这样一种罪恶的论调：不同制度的国家不能在互相尊重独立的基础上共处。”
    “解放报”的社论说：“和平终于得到了胜利。这是一个最后一分钟的卑鄙阴谋都不能够阻挡的胜利。这是我们有权利感到骄傲的真正的和巨大的胜利。多少年以来，我们一直没有得到机会来庆幸这样一个成功——对法国的事业和人类的事业同样都有贡献的成功。
    结束战争的决心是在法国人民心里产生、坚强起来，而最后取得胜利的。”
      “解放报”最后说：法国现在应该担当起解决欧洲问题这样一个伟大而崇高的任务。
      “世界报”社论以“和平的希望、法国的复兴”为题写道：印度支那敌对行动的停止是全法国复兴和独立的先决条件。“世界报”说，日内瓦的优点是用和平竞赛的原则代替了利益之间和主义之间的敌对状态。“世界报”然后说：“假如冷战在欧洲继续下去并恶化的话，保证东南亚的和平共处是没有意义的。现在压倒其他一切问题的一个问题是：德国将重新武装起来吗？假如竟然重新武装起来，那么对谁有利呢？自一九五零年以来，美国政府就一直在设法想破坏同盟，使德国得到好处。”
    “战斗报”的社论欢迎印度支那的停战协定的消息，认为这是自从法国解放以来最好的消息。“经过了八年时间，理智才在法国战胜了幻想和盲目。”
    朝鲜报纸
    朝鲜各大报纸发表社论，热烈欢迎印度支那停战协定的签订。
    “劳动新闻”二十二日发表题为“和平民主力量的又一个胜利”的社论。社论说，日内瓦会议虽然没有能够完成它的全部任务，但是，在民主阵营国家的巨大努力之下，获得了重要的成果。美帝国主义者虽然破坏了日内瓦会议关于朝鲜问题的讨论，但是，没有能够阻挡住印度支那和平的恢复。
    社论指出，印度支那和平的恢复，对帝国主义者在远东的侵略政策是一个新的打击。美帝国主义者企图使朝鲜停战继续处于不稳定状态。如果，美帝国主义者不记取任何教训，而制造新的冒险，那么，它必将遭到更惨重的失败。
    “民主朝鲜报”以“印度支那战争的停止是和平民主阵营的巨大胜利”为题发表社论说：
    印度支那的停火，提供了以协商方法解决国际争端的又一个范例。美帝国主义所散布的“协商无益”的论调被粉碎了。
    社论说，关于在印度支那停战协定的签订，进一步坚定了为祖国的和平统一而斗争的朝鲜人民的斗志。朝鲜人民在亚洲和全世界的和平民主力量的强有力的支援下，一定要达成祖国的和平统一的伟大事业。
    印度尼西亚共产党总书记艾地
    印尼共产党总书记艾地二十二日向报界发表谈话说，印度支那停战协定是协商原则战胜战争原则的巨大胜利。和平事业的这一胜利是合乎印尼人民的愿望的，因此，这个胜利受到了热烈的欢迎。
    艾地说：“今后我们的任务就是扩大已经获得的胜利。就印尼来说，日内瓦会议以后和平事业的发展，将对我们所进行的关于收复西伊里安归入印尼版图、解散荷兰—印尼联邦和废除圆桌会议协定的斗争有直接的帮助。”
    日共中央指导部主席春日正一
    日本共产党中央指导部主席春日正一在二十一日就日内瓦会议达成印度支那停战和恢复和平的协议发表谈话。
    春日正一说：印度支那停战协议的达成，是美国好战政策的大失败；同时，证明了和平力量的强大。这一事件有着重大的意义。
    春日正一指出：美国今后仍然会逆着历史的潮流用军事方法来扩张它的势力。为了这个目的，美国特别瞩目于日本，想迫使日本加紧重整军备。但是，日本人民对重整军备政策的推行将不能再加容忍；人民会自觉地使争取民族独立和和平的斗争高涨起来。
      印度报纸
    二十二日的德里报纸普遍发表评论，欢迎印度支那停战协定的签订。
    “印度时报”的政治记者说：“印度支那的停火是和平的意愿战胜了战争。这是勇敢的和耐心的谈判的胜利。”记者指出，在谈判中，“美国选择了近乎歇斯底里的恐惧和不信任的态度而站在一边。……会议的成功使他们冷不提防，使他们茫然不知所措。”记者并指出，中国的威信在这次会议后大大地提高了。现在让中国进入联合国，将是比东南亚公约组织更好的亚洲和平的保障。
    “印度斯坦旗报”在社论中指出，印度支那停战“不但对印度支那的人民，而且对东南亚其他国家的人民以及法国的人民都是极大的慰藉，因为经过七年的痛苦和残酷的战争终于因和平协商而停止了。共处的精神已在无形中贯彻在国际谈判之中。……美国坚持要建立有‘军事威力’的东南亚公约组织，这种主张现在看来似乎比过去更不合理了。”
      “印度斯坦时报”的记者说：“这种通过协商而不是通过战争来获得和平的非常事件，不但对亚洲的和平是个好兆，而且对促进东西方将来的谅解和合作也是个好兆。”
    印地文的“印度斯坦报”在社论中写道：“日内瓦会议已经证明了：不论问题如何复杂，如果双方有决心的话，这种问题是可以通过共同协商来加以解决的。最复杂的问题也能够通过桌上的谈判而不是通过战场来解决。”
      英国报纸
    英国报纸欢迎关于在日内瓦会议上达成印度支那停战协定的消息。有些报纸指出，印度支那问题的解决，给世界其他问题的解决打开了一条道路。
    “工人日报”说，停战协定不但结束了印度支那的杀戮，并且还避免了发生世界大战的危险。报纸说：“和平的这一个胜利必须成为取得更大成就的桥梁。必须在欧洲问题，首先在德国的前途问题上也达成协议。在印度支那问题上达成解决办法的国家也能够在欧洲问题上达成一个解决办法。英国人民必须坚持：他们的政府对这个目的要作出重大的贡献。”
    “每日先驱报”的社论认为印度支那停战协定是和平的一个胜利。它说：“在协商的精神占上风的时候，让政治家们行动起来吧。日内瓦会议可以作为走向世界上亿万人民所祈望着的真正和平的道路的指标。”
    “伯明翰邮报”社论说，无论如何，协定的条文“是困难问题的公正解决办法”。
    “曼彻斯特卫报”社论说，“目前知道的只是大概的情况，并不是详细情节。但是，这种大概的情况造成令人愉快的印象。”
    “约克郡邮报”二十二日也承认，九国于印度支那问题所作的宣言的确好像是为在东南亚的和平共处打下了基础。（据新华社讯）
