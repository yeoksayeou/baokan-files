Dearest Comrade Jiu Gao:

    Welcoming the Draft Constitution Representing Our Interests

    Our country's draft constitution has been promulgated. Have you seen it? I have read it several times, and each time I read it very carefully. I think that the provisions of the draft constitution are all in line with the interests of the working people and are all beneficial to the people. It is truly a draft constitution that represents our own interests, truly a great happy event for our country!

    Did you notice Articles 7 and 8 of the draft constitution? They are all about agriculture. They point out the direction of agricultural development in our country and also state that the state should "guide and help individual farmers increase production, and encourage them to organize production cooperatives, supply and marketing cooperatives, and credit cooperatives based on the principle of voluntariness. The state adopts a policy of restricting and gradually eliminating the rich peasant economy." Indeed, farmers can only live a good life and harvest more grain by following this path. I remember that before our family joined the cooperative, our labor force was weak, and we were always lacking this or that in production, and we really suffered a lot of difficulties. After joining the cooperative, it was completely different. For example, last year there was a drought, and several acres of land in the cooperative were affected. The cooperative organized the labor force to fight the drought every day. As a result, not only was the crop not damaged, but it also had a bumper harvest. If we had worked individually, we could only watch the crops die! In addition, the cooperative is much stronger than individual households in terms of land use, labor allocation, and the promotion of advanced technology... There are so many advantages! After joining the cooperative, our family's life is also very different from before. Last autumn harvest, our family received seven thousand catties of cotton and grain, built a new house, added three sets of new quilts and curtains, and also bought a thermos bottle. Now our family also raises a pig weighing a hundred catties. Compared with the past, it is really like heaven and earth. When we first joined the cooperative, my mother was not happy, saying that joining the cooperative would not improve production and would even lose money. But now she doesn't say anything and even smiles when she thinks about it. This year, when we expanded the cooperative, she also mobilized two households, including Wu Jie'er, to join our cooperative. Other farmers saw with their own eyes that the cooperative's production was good and the members' income increased, and they all automatically requested to join the cooperative. Many people who couldn't figure it out in the past now understand that everyone recognizes that only by taking the path of mutual assistance and cooperation can our farmers live a prosperous life. Jiu Gao, think about it, now that this is also stipulated in the draft constitution, who wouldn't like it!

    Also, you may not have as deep an understanding as I do, and that is Article 96 of the draft constitution. It states: "Women in the People's Republic of China enjoy equal rights with men in all aspects of political, economic, cultural, social and family life. Marriage, family, mother and child are protected by the state." Before liberation, where did women have so much "status"? They were not like dolls following others around all day long! It has only been a few years since liberation, and which job in our country does not have women participating? Operating machines, growing crops, none of them lag behind. Even the airplanes flying in the sky have a share of our women! Take me for example. Under the cultivation and education of the Party, I became the director of the women's association in our township, the vice chairman of the agricultural production cooperative, and was also named a model military family member and a model worker. Last year, I even went to the place where you are fighting with the Third Chinese People's Delegation to Korea. You tell me, since the founding of our new China, which aspect has ever looked down on women? Now that the constitution also stipulates the proper status of women, what kind of feeling should I have in my heart!

    Jiu Gao, I remembered again that when we went to Korea last year to see you, we saw and heard many heroic stories of Korean women. They were all excellent Korean women who did a lot for their country. There was an old lady in Hamgyong Province named Yoon Ok-hee, and everyone called her "Glorious Mother." When fighting the American devils, she sent all eight of her sons to join the People's Army, and she worked hard at home to support the front lines. Also, there was a woman named Gu Fuli in Sinpung Village, Changdo County, Kangwon Province. She was a famous "Support-the-Front Model" in Korea. Her husband sacrificed himself to protect the wounded volunteer soldiers. Gu Fuli gritted her teeth, swallowed the tears of hatred, and continued to take on the task that her husband had not completed. Also, there are many, many such examples. They are all role models for us to learn from. I want to learn from their spirit, and I also want to learn from your spirit, to lead our agricultural production cooperative well. At present, the early rice in the cooperative has already bowed its head to scatter seeds, and the weeding, hoeing, and topdressing of the intermediate rice is also very urgent. The cooperative is also planning to expand the paddy fields for intermediate rice and double-cropping rice. In any case, I will definitely work with the cooperative committee members to mobilize all members to overcome natural disasters and complete the weeding, hoeing, topdressing, and expansion of intermediate rice and double-cropping rice planting according to plan, and strive to complete this year's production increase plan, produce more grain to support our country's socialist construction, and support your struggle to resist America and aid Korea. In this way, you can better defend the motherland, and the workers can also provide us with more machines to accelerate the socialist transformation of agriculture.

    What about you? Jiu Gao! I know that you know more and are clearer than I am. Doesn't Article 20 of the draft constitution also write out your tasks? You will definitely be happier and more energetic than in the past after reading this article! Article 103 of the draft constitution also states: "Defending the motherland is the sacred duty of every citizen of the People's Republic of China." I think so too. If it weren't for so many volunteer soldiers and People's Liberation Army comrades defending our country, how could we be able to farm well, and the worker big brothers wouldn't be able to carry out production competitions. In the future, we must work harder. You better defend the motherland, and I better produce, and use this practical action to welcome the promulgation of our country's constitution!

### 欢迎代表咱们利益的宪法草案

专栏：寄战士

    编者按：李芝元是湖南省常德县人，共产党员，农业生产合作社副社长，乡妇女主任。她的丈夫是志愿军战士。下面，是她学习了中华人民共和国宪法草案以后，写给她丈夫的一封信。亲爱的久高同志：
    欢迎代表咱们利益的宪法草案
    咱们国家的宪法草案公布了，你看到了吗？我可是看了好几遍，遍遍都很用心。我觉得宪法草案所规定的都符合劳动人民的利益，都对人民有好处。真是代表咱们自己利益的宪法草案，真是咱们国家的一件大喜事！
    你注意到宪法草案第七条和第八条了吗？那上面都是对农业方面的规定，它指出了咱们国家农业发展的方向，还说：国家要“指导和帮助个体农民增加生产，并且鼓励他们根据自愿的原则组织生产合作、供销合作和信用合作。国家对富农经济采取限制和逐步消灭的政策”。的确，农民只有走这条道路，才能多打粮食，才能过好日子。记得咱家在没有入社以前，劳动力单薄，搞起生产来不是缺这样，就是少那样，真是不晓得受了多少困难。入社以后，就全不同了。比如，去年缺雨，社里好几亩地都遭了旱，合作社就组织了劳动力，每天出动抗旱，结果庄稼不仅没有受到损失，还得到了丰收。要是单干的话，只能看着庄稼干死！另外，土地使用上，劳动力分配上，还有推广先进技术上……，合作社都比单干户强，优越性可多着哩！参加了合作社以后，咱们家里的生活也和以前大不同了。去年秋收时，咱家连棉花带谷子就分了七千斤，盖了一栋新房子，添了三套新被子、帐子，还买了一个热水瓶。现在咱家里还喂着一口百把斤重的猪。和过去比起来，真是相差天上地下啦。刚入社时咱妈可不乐意，说入了社生产搞不好，还会倒贴本。可是现在她老人家啥也不说了，想起来还抿着嘴笑。今年扩大合作社时，她还动员了吴阶儿等两户农民参加了咱们的合作社哩。别的农民亲眼看到社里生产搞得好，社员收入增加了，也都自动要求入社。过去很多想不通的人，现在都明白了，大家都认识到只有走互助合作这条道路，才是咱们农民能过富足生活的唯一道路。久高，想想看，如今宪法草案上也规定了这一条，谁的心里能不喜欢！
    还有一点，你可能没有我体会得深刻，那就是宪法草案第九十六条。这一条里写着：“中华人民共和国妇女在政治的、经济的、文化的、社会的和家庭的生活各方面享有同男子平等的权利。婚姻、家庭、母亲和儿童受国家的保护。”解放以前，妇女那有这么多“地位”呀，还不是人家说啥就是啥，整天跟着人家转！解放才几年，咱们国家的那一样工作没有妇女参加呀。开机器、种庄稼，那一样也不落人后，就是天上飞的飞机，也有我们妇女的一份！就说我吧，在党的培养和教育下，当上了咱们乡的妇女主任、农业生产合作社的副社长，还被评为军属模范和工作模范，就是你们打仗的那个地方，去年我也跟着中国人民第三届赴朝慰问团去过。你说，咱们新中国成立后，那一样轻视过妇女，如今宪法上也规定了妇女应有的地位，你说我的心里该是啥滋味！
    久高，我又想起来了，去年我们到朝鲜去看你们的时候，曾经看到和听到好多朝鲜妇女的英雄故事，她们都是顶好的朝鲜妇女，为自己的国家做了很多事情。咸镜北道有一位六十多岁的老太太，叫尹玉琦，人家都叫她“光荣母亲”。和美国鬼子打仗的时候，她把自己的八个儿子都送去参加了人民军，自己在家中努力生产，支援前线。还有，江原道昌道郡新丰里有个妇女叫具富力，她是朝鲜著名的“支前模范”。她的丈夫为了掩护志愿军伤员牺牲了，具富力咬着牙，咽下了仇恨的泪水，继续担负起她丈夫没有完成的任务。还有，很多很多这样的例子，她们都是我们学习的榜样，我要学习她们的精神，也要学习你们的精神，把咱们的农业生产合作社领导好。目前社里的早稻已经低头散籽，中稻的踩草、锄草、追肥工作也很紧迫，社里还计划着扩大中稻和双季稻的稻田。不管怎么样，我一定和社务委员们一起，发动全体社员战胜自然灾害，按计划完成踩草、锄草、追肥和扩大种中稻和双季稻等工作，争取完成今年的增产计划，多打粮食支援咱们国家的社会主义建设，支援你们的抗美援朝斗争。这样，你们就可以更好地保卫祖国，工人也可以供给我们更多的机器，加速对农业的社会主义改造。
    你呢？久高！我知道你比我知道得更多，更清楚。宪法草案第二十条不是也写出来你们的任务了吗？你看了这一条一定会比过去更高兴，更有精神！宪法草案第一百零三条还说：“保卫祖国是中华人民共和国每一个公民的神圣职责。”我觉着也是这样。要不是那么多的志愿军和解放军同志保卫着咱们的国家，我们怎么还能够好好种地，工人老大哥也没办法搞生产竞赛了。以后，咱们得更努力，你更好地保卫祖国，我更好地生产，用这种实际行动来迎接咱们国家的宪法的公布！
