Visiting and Comforting on the Front Lines of National Defense

Zhang Xiuchuan, Deputy Head of the First Sub-Group of the National People's Comfort Delegation to the People's Liberation Army, Representative of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army

Entrusted by the leaders and all comrades of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army (CPVA), we came from the front lines in Korea to the southeastern front lines of our motherland's national defense – Fujian – to visit and comfort the heroic PLA elder brother troops who vigilantly guard the coast and islands day and night, facing the sea breeze and waves. During the month and three days, our hearts were constantly racing, our blood was constantly boiling, and each of us was deeply moved, profoundly educated, and infinitely encouraged.

Wherever we went, we were first met with warm welcomes from our comrades. Many troops waited for hours under the intense sun, in violent storms, and in the pitch-black night to welcome us. Some troops stationed on small islands even went to the mainland to transport pine branches to build arches, which were sometimes blown down several times by the sea breeze, but they still rebuilt them. One soldier on a small island even built it six times in a row. Wherever we went, we were like a ball of fire, cheering, embracing, shaking hands, dancing, and singing with the soldiers. Wherever we went, there was applause after applause, slogan after slogan, and many people even clapped their hands sore and shouted themselves hoarse. They sent us the spoils of victory from the Dongshan Island battle, they hung medals and commemorative badges bearing victory and honor on our chests, and they sent us various strange shells picked up from the beach and beautiful sea flowers found in the crevices of the reefs as souvenirs. The soldiers all felt honored to see the CPVA representatives. The troops stationed in northeastern Fujian even published wall newspapers specially to welcome the CPVA. Whenever the soldiers' rough hands tightly grasped our hands, their strong bodies tightly embraced us; whenever the soldiers addressed us with extremely affectionate voices, calling us "the most beloved people"; whenever we saw huge slogans posted everywhere saying "Salute to the glorious Chinese People's Volunteer Army! Learn from the CPVA's modernized combat experience!"... we were deeply moved.

Wherever we went, we were also treated with warm and meticulous care. The leaders and soldiers of the troops vacated the best houses for us to live in. In particular, the troops stationed on Dongshan Island specially rushed to repair the barracks to welcome us. They gave them to us without even living in them once. The chief of staff of a certain unit stationed on Pingtan Island lived in a tent himself and vacated the house for us to live in, and even covered us with quilts late at night. Some troops gave us newly built hospitals that had not yet housed the wounded and sick. Many troops also specially pasted beautiful pictures and displayed the most beautiful flowers in the houses for us. They cooked the best food for us to eat. The troops stationed on small islands, where water was very scarce, spent many days preparing a lot of fresh water for us. Some cooks even spent their own money to buy us fish and eggs, and many squads and platoons spent their own money to buy us cigarettes and candy. When we arrived at Dongshan Island, because the water was shallow and the ships could not dock, the soldiers jumped into the water wearing cotton clothes to carry the female comrades over. On rainy days, the soldiers took off their cotton clothes to cover our luggage. During the days we spent intimately with the heroes and comrades, we never felt any difficulty or strangeness, and we felt comfortable and亲切 everywhere.

The great achievements of the troops stationed in Fujian in defending and building the motherland over the past few years; the great victory of advancing into Fujian and liberating Fujian; the remarkable achievements in consolidating national defense and suppressing bandits, especially the great contributions made in the Dongshan Island battle; and the miracles created in military training and cultural learning, all greatly encouraged us. Their deeds of using "army plus wooden boats" to conduct cross-sea operations, turning the army into sailors operating at sea, and defeating enemy warships with wooden boats; the deeds of reconnaissance heroes swimming dozens of miles to reconnoiter the situation and capture prisoners; the deeds of the island garrison troops enduring special hardships and overcoming unimaginable difficulties to turn barren islands into homes; their deeds of saving food and clothing, providing relief to disaster victims, helping coastal people carry out production, and rescuing fishermen in distress in the raging waves; and the deeds of countless martyrs who gave their all and shed their last drop of blood for the cause of people's liberation, all deeply moved and educated us. When we saw the soldiers vigilantly monitoring the ocean on the coast and islands, and the anti-aircraft gunners vigilantly monitoring the sky on the positions; when we saw the soldiers training hard on the training grounds to build a modernized national defense force; when we heard their many outstanding and vivid heroic model deeds, especially when we heard the heroic deeds of Zhang Xuedong, a hero in the style of Huang Jiguang, Huang Feilong, a hero in the style of Yang Gensi, Hu Weizhi, a hero of cross-sea reconnaissance, Li Fulai, a tiger-fighting hero, and Zhang Xiukun, a literary and artistic soldier in the style of Gao Yubao; all these added infinite strength to us, made us further realize in our minds that the PLA is indeed the most beloved and most respectable people, made us further realize that the task of the PLA in defending national defense and the CPVA in resisting US aggression and aiding Korea is not only closely linked and inextricably linked, but also equally important, equally arduous, and equally glorious, and made us feel that the PLA is the best example for us to learn from everywhere.

When we left Fujian, how many comrades and loved ones shed tears! The scene of such extreme reluctance and reluctance made us unable to control our inner excitement and tears. Many comrades said, "We will never forget March 1954, we will never forget those glorious, joyful, and exciting days." Every comrade expressed their determination more than once: dear comrades and loved ones, we assure you that we will definitely guard our positions, heighten our vigilance, and prevent any enemy conspiracy to sabotage the armistice agreement; help the Korean people restore production and rebuild their homes; and actively improve the military, political, and cultural level of the troops, and fight to the end to consolidate the victory of the Korean armistice and strive for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. In order to defend the socialist construction of the motherland, in order to defend lasting peace in the Far East and the world, we will not hesitate to sacrifice everything, even our beautiful youth and precious lives!

    慰问在国防最前线
    全国人民慰问人民解放军代表团  第一总分团副团长、志愿军代表  张秀川
    我们受了志愿军首长和全体同志的委托，从朝鲜前线来到祖国东南的国防最前线——福建，看望和慰问日日夜夜迎着海风海浪警惕地守卫在沿海及岛屿上的英雄的解放军老大哥部队。在一个月零三天的日子里，我们的心时刻在紧张地跳动，我们的血时刻在激烈地沸腾，我们每一个人都受到了极大的感动、深刻的教育和无限的鼓舞。
    每到一地，我们首先碰到的是战友们热烈的欢迎。不少部队在强烈的阳光下，在狂风暴雨中，在漆黑的夜里，一连等几个钟头来欢迎我们。有些驻在小岛上的部队还特意到陆地上去运来了松树枝搭成彩门，有时叫海风几次吹坏，他们还照样搭了起来，有一个小岛上的战士竟连续搭了六次。我们每到一处便像一团火一样地同战士在一起欢呼、拥抱、握手、舞蹈和歌唱。我们每到一处都是掌声连着掌声，口号接着口号，甚至很多人拍疼了手和喊哑了喉咙。他们把东山岛战斗的胜利品送给我们，他们把带着胜利和荣誉的奖章和纪念章挂在我们的胸前，他们把从海滩上拣来的各种奇怪的蚌壳和从礁石缝中找到的漂亮的海花送给我们作纪念。战士们都以能看到志愿军代表为光荣，驻在福建东北的部队还专门出版了欢迎志愿军的墙报，每当战士们粗大的手紧紧握着我们的手、健壮的身躯紧紧地拥抱着我们的时候；每当战士们以极其亲切的声音口口声声称我们“最可爱的人”的时候；每当我们看到到处张贴的“向光荣的中国人民志愿军致敬！学习志愿军现代化作战经验！”等巨幅标语的时候……，我们都受到深深的感动。
    我们每到一地，也受到了热情的无微不至的招待。部队首长和战士把最好的房子腾出来给我们住，特别是驻在东山岛的部队，为了迎接我们，还特地赶修了营房，他们一次未住就让给了我们。驻平潭岛某部的参谋长自己住帐棚，把房子腾出来给我们住，深夜还给我们盖被子。有些部队把新建筑的尚未住过伤病员的医院先给我们住。不少部队还专门为我们在房子里张贴了漂亮的图画和陈设了最美丽的鲜花。他们做最好的饭菜给我们吃，驻在小岛上吃水非常困难的部队，还用很多天时间为我们准备了很多淡水。有的炊事员自己出钱给我们买鱼和鸡蛋，许多班排自己出钱给我们买了纸烟和糖果。我们到达东山岛时，因为水浅船只不能靠岸，战士们便穿着棉衣跳下水去把女同志背过去，下雨天战士还把棉衣脱下来给我们盖行李。在我们与英雄和战友们亲密相处的日子里，从没有感到一点困难和生疏，处处感到舒适和亲切。
    驻福建的部队几年来保卫祖国、建设祖国的伟大成就；进军福建，解放福建的伟大胜利；巩固国防、剿灭土匪的显著成绩，特别在东山岛战斗中所建立的伟大功勋；军事训练和文化学习上创造的奇迹，都极大地鼓舞了我们。他们以“陆军加木船”进行渡海作战，把陆军变为海上作战的水兵、以木船击败敌人兵舰的事迹；侦察英雄游过数十里海面侦察情况和捕抓俘虏的事迹；守岛部队忍受特殊艰苦、克服难以想像的困难，把荒凉的海岛变为家园的事迹；他们节衣缩食、救济灾民、帮助沿海人民进行生产和在惊涛骇浪中抢救受难渔民的事迹；无数名烈士赤胆忠心为人民解放事业英勇战斗而流尽最后一滴血的事迹，都深深地感动和教育了我们。当我们看到战士们在海岸和海岛上警惕地监视着海洋、高射炮手在阵地上警惕地监视着天空的时候；当我们看到战士们为了建设现代化国防军而在操场上紧张操练的时候；当我们听到他们许多突出的、生动的英雄模范事迹的时候，特别是当我们听到黄继光式的英雄张学栋、杨根思式的英雄黄飞龙、越海侦察英雄胡维志、打虎英雄李富来和高玉宝式的文艺战士张岫昆等英雄模范事迹的时候；都给我们增加了无穷的力量，使我们从思想上进一步体会到解放军确实是最可爱、最可敬的人，使我们进一步体会到解放军保卫国防与志愿军抗美援朝的任务，不仅是紧密联系和息息相关的，而且是同等重要、同样艰苦和光荣的，使我们感到解放军处处是我们学习的最好榜样。
    当我们离开福建的时候，有多少战友和亲人们在洒眼泪啊！那种万分依恋难舍的情景，使我们控制不住自己内心的激动和满眼的热泪。许多同志都说：“我们永远不会忘记一九五四年的三月，不会忘记那些光荣、欢乐和令人兴奋的日子。”每个同志都不止一次地表示自己的决心：亲密的战友和亲人们，我们向你们保证，我们一定严守阵地，提高警惕，防止敌人任何破坏停战协定的阴谋；帮助朝鲜人民恢复生产，重建家园；积极提高部队的军事、政治和文化水平，为巩固朝鲜停战的胜利，争取和平解决朝鲜问题而奋斗到底。为了保卫祖国社会主义建设，为了保卫远东和世界的持久和平，我们，将不惜牺牲自己的一切，甚至我们美丽的青春和宝贵的生命！（附图片）
