The speeches by representatives at the First National Congress of Cooperatives of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives have concluded. The speeches lasted for a day and a half. Representatives from cooperatives in twenty-one provinces, cities, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region spoke at the congress. In their speeches, they unanimously agreed that the reports made by the Provisional Council and the Provisional Supervisory Committee reflected the actual conditions of the cooperatives and that the three basic tasks for supply and marketing cooperatives during the transition period were correct and should be adopted by the congress.

Most representatives discussed the working conditions of local supply and marketing cooperatives in their speeches. The representative from Henan pointed out that the Henan cooperatives already had over 12 million members and more than 15,600 retail units, forming a vast new type of commercial network in more than 3,600 large and medium-sized market towns and larger villages throughout the province. In recent years, business has expanded exponentially, and the level of service to agricultural production and people's lives has continuously improved. The representative from the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region pointed out that cooperatives in Inner Mongolia have become indispensable economic organizations for all ethnic groups in production and life. The cooperative network covers every corner of agricultural, pastoral, and hunting areas, with almost every township having a retail outlet. In addition, mobile supply and marketing teams can deliver goods to the members' doors. He also pointed out that cooperatives provide members with great economic benefits. Herdsmen like to drink brick tea, but before liberation, fifty kilograms of wool could only be exchanged for four "27" brick teas. After the establishment of the cooperatives, the price ratio between brick tea and wool became reasonable. Liu Yufang, the deputy director of the Xinmin Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xinfan County, Sichuan, said that the timely supply of fertilizer by the supply and marketing cooperatives ensured their increased grain production. They signed a combination contract with the supply and marketing cooperatives, which supplied 25,000 kilograms of fine fertilizer when they were short of fertilizer in the second quarter. Now the seedlings are growing green and lush, and it is estimated that rice production will increase by more than 60,000 kilograms. The representative from the Yunnan Mosuo ethnic cooperative believed that the purchase of Poria cocos, a specialty of their mountainous area, by the supply and marketing cooperatives had a great impact on the economic life of the Mosuo people. The representative from the Shanxi cooperative pointed out that the amount of production materials they supplied to farmers in the first half of this year was more than double that of the same period last year. He specifically pointed out that Shanxi supply and marketing cooperatives have made great progress in signing pre-purchase contracts and combination contracts with farmers. According to preliminary statistics from 92 counties, grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives and agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams signed more than 10,000 contracts before the end of March. All levels of cooperatives overfulfilled the pre-purchase plans for grain, cotton, and oil crops in the first half of the year.

The representatives also pointed out shortcomings in their work in their speeches. The Shanxi representative said that their spirit of democratic management of cooperatives was still very poor, and they could not convene meetings of the board of directors, supervisors, and members' representatives on schedule, so they could not fully mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of the members. The representative from Henan pointed out the shortcomings of the leaders, saying that due to insufficient understanding of the role of this new type of trade network of cooperatives, cadres were affected by varying degrees of small-farmer ideology, and also because of some complacency, the common problem among cadres was that their socialist consciousness was not high and their guiding ideology of running cooperatives according to socialist principles was not clear. He said that we should examine our work in accordance with the spirit of the general task during the transition period and the report of the Provisional Council. Hu Daorong, the representative from the Shaanxi Provincial Cooperative, reflected the opinions of the members. He said that the main shortcomings of the cooperative's work were that it did not deeply understand the needs of the farmers, and did not supply materials in a timely manner according to the quantity, specifications, and quality needed by the farmers, resulting in a situation where what could be satisfied was not satisfied, and what could be done early was not done early.

The representatives' speeches made sincere criticisms of the shortcomings of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives in terms of insufficient specific leadership, the lack of a clear policy for serving agricultural production in the past, and the relatively poor education of cadres. Some also made suggestions aimed at the shortcomings, hoping that the council elected at this conference would strengthen leadership and strive to implement the basic tasks of supply and marketing cooperatives during the transition period.

At the meeting on the 24th, all the representatives discussed the draft charter of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives item by item and then unanimously adopted the charter. Then the election method was adopted. After full consultation with the delegations from various regions, the presidium presented the list of candidates for the National Committee, the Council, and the Supervisory Committee of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives at the meeting. The group discussed the list in the afternoon. (Xinhua News Agency)

    全国合作社代表大会代表发言结束
    中华全国合作社第一次代表大会所进行的大会发言已经结束。大会发言进行了一天半。在大会上发言的有二十一个省、市和内蒙古自治区合作社的代表，他们在发言中一致认为临时理事会和临时监事会所作的各项报告反映了合作社的实际状况；所提出的供销合作社在过渡时期的三项基本任务是正确的，大会应该予以采纳。
    大多数代表在发言中都谈到了本地供销合作社的工作状况。河南代表的发言指出，河南省合作社已拥有一千二百多万社员，共有一万五千六百多个零售单位，在全省三千六百多个大、中集镇和较大的村庄，构成了广大的新型的商业网，几年来业务成倍的扩大，为农业生产和为人民生活服务的水平不断提高。内蒙古自治区代表指出，合作社在内蒙古已成为各兄弟民族生产上、生活上不可分离的经济组织，合作社网布满了农业区、牧区、游猎区的各个角落，差不多每个乡就有一个零售点，再加上流动供销组就能把货物送到社员的门上。他并指出，合作社给社员以极大的经济利益，牧民喜欢饮用砖茶，但解放前五十公斤羊毛只能换到四块“二七”砖茶，合作社成立以后，砖茶和羊毛的比价合理了。四川合作社代表、新繁县新民村农业生产合作社副社长刘玉芳说，供销合作社及时供应肥料使他们增产粮食有了保障，他们和供销合作社订立结合合同，在二季度正缺乏肥料的时候供销合作社供应了细肥二万五千斤，现在秧苗子长得绿油油的，估计可增产稻谷六万多斤。云南么些族合作社代表认为供销合作社收购他们山区的特产茯苓，对么些族人民的经济生活有极大影响。山西的合作社代表指出，他们今年上半年供应农民生产资料的数量比去年同期增加一倍多。他特别指出，山西供销合作社和农民订立预购合同和结合合同的工作有很大开展，据九十二个县初步统计，基层供销合作社和农业生产合作社、互助组在三月底前签订的合同有一万多件，各级社在上半年超额完成了粮食、棉花、油料的预购计划。
    代表们在发言中也指出了工作中的缺点，山西代表说他们民主办社的精神还很差，不能按期召开理、监事会和社员代表大会，因而不能充分发挥社员的积极性和创造性。河南的代表指出了领导者的缺点，他说由于对合作社这种新型贸易网的作用认识不够，干部受着不同程度小农思想的影响，也由于存在着一些骄傲自满的情绪，在干部中普遍的问题是社会主义觉悟不高，按社会主义原则办社的指导思想不明确。他说，我们应该按着过渡时期总任务的精神和临时理事会的报告来检查工作。陕西省合作社代表胡道荣的发言反映了社员的意见，他说，合作社工作的主要缺点是没有深入了解农民的需要，没有按农民需要的数量、规格、质量及时供应物资，结果造成了能满足的没有满足，能早办的没有早办。
    代表们的发言，对中华全国合作社联合总社领导不够具体、过去对农业生产服务的方针不够明确、对干部的教育比较差等缺点进行了诚恳的批评。有些并针对着所提缺点提出了建议，希望在这次大会上选出的理事会加强领导，为贯彻供销合作社过渡时期的基本任务而奋斗。
    在二十四日的大会上，全体代表逐条讨论了中华全国供销合作总社章程草案后，一致通过了这个章程。接着通过了选举办法。主席团经过和各地代表团充分协商后，在大会上提出了中华全国供销合作总社全国委员会和理事会、监事会的候选人名单。下午分组讨论了这个名单。　（新华社）
