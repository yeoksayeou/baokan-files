    Recently, the All-China Democratic Women's Federation issued "Instructions on Current Rural Women's Work." This instruction, based on the spirit of the general task of the state's transition period, summarizes the experience of rural women's work in the past year, especially the experience of mobilizing rural women to participate in agricultural production and mutual aid and cooperation; it clarifies the fundamental task and current central work of rural women's work and puts forward specific work methods. This instruction is of great significance for the future development of rural women's work and further mobilizing rural women to invest in production and the mutual aid and cooperation movement.
    Rural women have always been a huge force in rural production. With the development of agricultural production and the mutual aid and cooperation movement, the role of women in agricultural production has become increasingly important. In many areas, women have become a major force in agricultural labor such as seed selection, fertilizer accumulation, weeding, thinning, pest control, drought resistance, flood prevention, harvesting, and threshing. In particular, the development of rural sideline occupations such as raising pigs and chickens is almost impossible without the widespread participation of women. In the development of sericulture and tea production, a large amount of female labor is invested in silkworm breeding and mulberry cultivation, tea picking and processing; some women in mountainous areas participate in the collection of medicinal materials and mountain products; women near the water participate in fish farming, duck raising, or weaving fishing nets. All of this shows that the importance of women in rural production is increasing day by day, and the road for rural women to participate in production is becoming wider and wider. In recent years, many production experts and labor models have emerged in various aspects of agricultural production.
    The central task of current rural women's work is to further educate and organize women to participate in the rural production increase movement centered on mutual aid and cooperation, and to further unleash the potential power of women in rural production. Rural women must be made to clearly recognize that the path of agricultural cooperation is not only the only way to develop agricultural production and enable farmers to get rid of poverty and move towards common prosperity; but only agricultural cooperation can provide the most practical and possible conditions for the complete liberation of rural women. Because only agricultural cooperation can rationally use female labor and gradually realize the principle of equal pay for equal work for men and women, making the road for women to participate in productive labor wider and wider, thereby changing women's dependence economically and improving women's social and family status; only agricultural cooperation can make it practically possible for women to continuously improve production technology in collective production and play a greater role in production; only agricultural cooperation can gradually solve the practical problems and special difficulties of women in participating in productive labor, so that women can engage in more and better productive labor, and learn cultural and scientific knowledge, as well as participate in social activities, thereby continuously improving the material and cultural lives of women and children. The facts of the past few years have also proved that the further the mutual aid and cooperation movement moves forward, the more benefits it brings to women. This means that every step forward in the socialist transformation of agriculture is a step forward for women towards their own complete liberation.
    Since the nationwide liberation, especially after the launch of propaganda on the general task of the state's transition period in rural areas last winter, the socialist consciousness of rural women has been significantly improved, the number of people participating in mutual aid and cooperation organizations has been increasing day by day, and a large number of women have assumed leadership positions in mutual aid and cooperation organizations. For example, in the 351 agricultural production cooperatives in Tongxian County, Hebei, there are more than 14,000 members, of which more than 7,300 are female members, accounting for more than half of the total number of members. According to statistics from 16 counties in Changzhi Prefecture, Shanxi, there are 19 female chairpersons, 4,003 vice-chairpersons, and nearly 10,000 women in total, including members of the cooperative affairs committee, production team leaders, and labor group leaders. Comrade Stalin pointed out in his speech at the First All-Union Congress of Collective Farm Shock Workers: "Women are a huge force in collective farms. It is a crime to bury this force. Our responsibility is to promote women in collective farms and use this force." The experience of many regions in the past has proved that without the active participation and active support of women, the mutual aid and cooperation movement cannot be carried out smoothly. Therefore, in the future mutual aid and cooperation movement, whoever does not pay attention to using the power of women, does not actively promote and train female cadres, and does not actively give play to the role of women in the mutual aid and cooperation movement, will be committing a crime, as Comrade Stalin said.
    In order to further educate and organize women to participate in the agricultural production increase movement centered on mutual aid and cooperation, rural women's work cadres must strive to improve their policy level and business level on the basis of their existing work, strive to learn basic production knowledge, continue to go deep into reality, go deep into the masses, understand the situation, create typical examples, and accumulate experience. Rural women's work cadres, especially cadres of women's federations at all levels below the prefecture, must be good at going deep into mutual aid groups and cooperatives to earnestly learn the experience of running groups and cooperatives, accumulate the experience of carrying out women's work in the different stages of the establishment, consolidation, and development of groups and cooperatives, and must proceed from actual needs and possibilities, and often study and appropriately solve the practical problems and special difficulties of women in participating in productive labor, such as equal pay for equal work for men and women, rational use of female labor, housework problems, child problems, and appropriate care for women during menstruation, pregnancy, childbirth, and illness. When solving these problems, we should further overcome the floating and unrealistic work style of some cadres, and prevent the two deviations of impetuosity and letting things drift in our work. At present, the participation of rural women in mutual aid and cooperation organizations is still very unbalanced nationwide. Therefore, women's work cadres in various localities should continue to improve the socialist consciousness of rural women, further guide a wider range of women to participate in mutual aid and cooperation organizations, and educate women who have participated in mutual aid and cooperation organizations to love their own groups or cooperatives, actively participate in productive labor, and use their own production achievements and benefits to influence, encourage, and drive individual peasant women to gradually organize themselves.
    The development of rural women's work is impossible without the leadership of the Party. Party organizations at all levels must strengthen their leadership over women's work. It should be understood that rural women's work is an important part of rural mass work. In the mutual aid and cooperation movement and the production increase movement, party organizations at all levels must adhere to the principle of mobilizing both men and women together, uniformly arrange and inspect women's work. Only in this way can the mutual aid and cooperation movement and the production increase movement be carried out smoothly, and only in this way can rural women's work be done well.

### 充分发挥农村妇女在互助合作运动中的作用

    充分发挥农村妇女在互助合作运动中的作用
    最近中华全国民主妇女联合会发出了“关于当前农村妇女工作的指示”。这个指示，根据国家过渡时期总任务的精神，总结了最近一年来农村妇女工作的经验，特别是发动农村妇女参加农业生产和互助合作的经验；明确指出了农村妇女工作的根本任务和当前的中心工作，并提出了工作的具体作法。这个指示对今后农村妇女工作的开展，和进一步动员农村妇女投入生产和互助合作运动，有着十分重要的意义。
    农村妇女历来就是农村生产中的一支巨大的力量。随着农业生产和互助合作运动的发展，妇女在农业生产中的作用已经越来越重要。不少地区在选种、积肥、薅草、间苗、除虫、抗旱、防涝、收割、打场等等农业劳动中，妇女已成为一种主要力量，特别是饲养猪、鸡等等农村副业的开展，没有妇女的普遍的参加，几乎是不可能的。在发展蚕丝业、制茶业中，大量妇女劳动力投入了养蚕育桑，采制茶叶等；还有些山区妇女参加了采集药材、山货的生产；靠水边的妇女参加了养鱼、养鸭或编织渔网等劳动。所有这一切都说明了妇女在农村生产中的重要性正日益增加着，农村妇女参加生产的道路日益宽广。近年来在农业生产的各个方面，并出现了不少的生产能手和劳动模范。
    当前农村妇女工作的中心任务是要进一步教育与组织妇女参加以互助合作为中心的农村增产运动，进一步发挥妇女在农村生产中的潜在力量。必须使农村妇女明确认识，农业合作化的道路，不仅是发展农业生产和使农民摆脱贫困走向共同富裕的唯一道路；而且只有农业合作化才能为农村妇女的彻底解放，提供最实际可能的条件。因为只有农业合作化，才有可能合理使用妇女劳动力和逐步实现男女同工同酬的原则，使妇女参加生产劳动的道路越走越宽，从而在经济上改变妇女的依附关系，提高妇女的社会地位和家庭地位；只有农业合作化，才有实际可能使妇女在集体生产中不断提高生产技术，和在生产中发挥更大的作用；只有农业合作化，才有可能逐步解决妇女在参加生产劳动中的各种切身问题和特殊困难，使妇女能更多和更好地从事生产劳动，并学习文化科学知识，以及参加社会活动，从而使妇女不断提高自身和儿童的物质与文化生活。过去几年的事实也已证明，互助合作运动越前进一步，给妇女带来的好处也就越多。这也就是说，农业社会主义改造事业每前进一步，妇女也就将向自身的彻底解放前进一步。
    全国解放后，特别是去冬农村开展了关于国家过渡时期总任务的宣传以后，农村妇女的社会主义觉悟，已有显著的提高，参加互助合作组织的人数已日益增加，并有大量的妇女在互助合作组织中担任了领导工作。如河北通县三百五十一个农业生产合作社，共有社员一万四千多人，其中女社员就有七千三百多人，占社员总数的一半以上。据山西长治专区十六个县的统计，在农业生产合作社担任领导工作的，有女社长十九名，副社长四千零三名，连同社务委员、生产队长、劳动组长等合计起来近一万名妇女。斯大林同志在第一次全苏联集体农庄突击队员代表大会上的演说中指出：“妇女在集体农庄中是一个巨大的力量。埋没这个力量，就是犯罪了。我们的责任，就是要在集体农庄中提拔妇女，运用这个力量。”过去许多地区的经验证明，没有妇女的积极参加和积极支持，互助合作运动就不能够顺利地开展。因此，在今后的互助合作运动中，谁要是不注意运用妇女这个力量，不积极提拔和培养妇女干部，不积极发挥妇女在互助合作运动中的作用，那么，就正会像斯大林同志说的一样，是一种犯罪行为。
    为了进一步教育和组织妇女参加以互助合作为中心的农业增产运动，农村妇女工作干部必须在现有的工作基础上，努力提高自己的政策水平和业务水平，努力学习生产基本知识，继续深入实际，深入群众，了解情况，创造典型，积累经验。农村妇女工作干部，特别是专区以下各级妇联的干部，要善于深入到互助组和合作社中去，认真学习办组、办社的经验，积累组、社在建立、巩固和发展的不同阶段中进行妇女工作的经验，必须从实际的需要和可能出发，经常研究并适当解决妇女在参加生产劳动中的切身问题和特殊困难，如男女同工同酬，合理使用妇女劳动力，家务问题，孩子问题，以及对妇女在经期、孕期、产期和有病时的适当照顾等。在解决这些问题时，应进一步克服某些干部的飘浮和不切实际的作风，防止在工作中容易产生的急躁冒进和放任自流两种偏向。目前农村妇女参加互助合作组织的情况，从全国来说还很不平衡。因此，各地妇女工作干部应继续提高农村妇女的社会主义觉悟，进一步引导更广大的妇女群众参加互助合作组织，教育已参加互助合作组织的妇女，要热爱自己的组或社，积极参加生产劳动，并以自身的生产成绩和所得的好处，影响、鼓励和带动单干户妇女也逐渐组织起来。
    农村妇女工作的开展，没有党的领导是不可能的。各级党的组织，必须加强对妇女工作的领导。应当了解，农村妇女工作是农村群众工作的一个重要部分。各级党的组织在互助合作运动和增产运动中，必须坚持男女一齐发动的方针，统一布置并检查妇女工作。只有这样，互助合作运动和增产运动才能够顺利开展，也只有这样，才能够把农村妇女工作做好。
