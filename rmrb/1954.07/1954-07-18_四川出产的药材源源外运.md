Sichuan-produced Medicinal Materials Shipped Out Continuously

Sichuan Province's medicinal materials, including Alisma, Fritillaria, Ophiopogon japonicus, musk, Coptis chinensis, and Codonopsis pilosula, are being shipped out continuously. From January to May, a total of 501,300 jin were shipped out. Recently harvested Ligusticum chuanxiong and Aconitum carmichaelii are being shipped out in succession according to the export plan.

Sichuan is a region in our country rich in medicinal materials, producing over 300 kinds, including important medicines such as Ligusticum chuanxiong, Fritillaria, and Alisma. Besides being sold throughout the country, they are also welcomed in the international market. This year, state-owned commercial departments have further improved the quality, specifications, and packaging of medicinal materials. The Guanxian Ligusticum chuanxiong processing plant, affiliated with the Sichuan Provincial Trade Company, has processed Ligusticum chuanxiong this year with a dryness level reaching over 95%; the loss rate has decreased from 12% last year to 5%. Many farmers, knowing that the state can exchange exported medicinal materials for machinery, etc., are now harvesting medicinal materials according to the new season and carefully drying them. As a result, the large quantities of medicinal materials purchased by the Sichuan Provincial Trade Company from January to May this year are of good quality and uniform specifications.

    四川出产的药材源源外运
    四川省出产的药材泽泻、贝母、麦冬、麝香、黄连、党参等正源源外运，一至五月份共运出五十万一千三百多斤。最近出新的川芎、坿子等药材，正按照出口计划陆续启运中。
    四川是我国盛产药材的地区，所产药材种类在三百种以上，其中像川芎、贝母、泽泻等都是重要药物，除销售国内各地外，并受到国际市场的欢迎。今年国营商业部门对药材的品质、规格以及包装都作了进一步的改进。四川省贸易公司所属灌县川芎加工场，今年加工的川芎，干度达到百分之九十五以上；损耗率由去年的百分之十二下降到百分之五。许多农民知道国家出口药材可以换回机器等情况后，都做到按出新季节采挖药材，并进行了细致的炕、晒。因而，今年一到五月份四川省贸易公司收购的大批药材品质良好，规格划一。
