    How Soviet Foreign Trade Served Socialist Industrialization
    Zeng Gao

    I.

    After the end of the period of national economic recovery, the Soviet Union began to enter a new period of socialist industrialization. The sufficient supply of machinery and equipment was an extremely important condition for realizing socialist industrialization. However, at that time, the Soviet Union was still a technologically backward country. It did not have sufficient machinery to supply industry, agriculture, and transportation, and it did not have the material conditions to technically transform the national economy. At that time, "if Russia did not use its existing raw materials to exchange for machinery and equipment from Western countries, then it would be difficult for Russia to establish transportation, develop industry, and electrify urban and rural industries on its own." (Stalin: "The Party Before and After Seizing Power") In order to realize the grand plan of developing the national economy, and in order to transform the Soviet Union from an agricultural country into an industrial country, Lenin pointed out that it was necessary to obtain the possibility of purchasing necessary machines as soon as possible. The faster this was done, the greater the foundation for the Soviet Union's economic independence from capitalist countries would be. ("Report on Concessions at the Meeting of the Bolshevik Group of the Eighth Congress of Soviets of the Russian Communist Party")

    In accordance with the instructions of Lenin and Stalin, in the process of realizing national industrialization, Soviet foreign trade undertook the task of importing machinery from abroad to accelerate industrial construction. In the four years of the first five-year plan alone, the Soviet Union imported as much as 7.19 billion rubles of machinery and equipment, becoming the country with the most imported machinery and equipment in the world. In 1932, it purchased about half of the world's total machinery exports (excluding automobiles). At that time, capitalist countries were in the throes of economic crisis, and the large machine factories in countries such as Britain and Germany relied almost entirely on Soviet orders to operate. It is not difficult to see how significant the role of such a huge amount of machinery flowing into the Soviet Union through foreign trade was for the growth and strengthening of Soviet industry.

    At that time, the Soviet Union did not casually import any machines, but imported them according to the needs of socialist industrialization. The central link of socialist industrialization was the development of heavy industry. Therefore, in terms of foreign trade, the focus was on importing machinery and equipment for heavy industry. From the first five-year plan to the realization of socialist industrialization, the proportion of imported heavy industry machinery and equipment in the total import of industrial machinery and equipment was very large. In 1929-1930, it accounted for 81.5 percent, and in 1931, it already accounted for 93.5 percent.

    The machinery industry is the core of heavy industry, and to develop heavy industry, one must first grasp this core. Only by grasping this core and establishing a strong machinery industry in the country can the country produce the necessary machinery and equipment independently, and only then can the various light and heavy industries and other economic sectors be comprehensively developed using the various machinery and equipment produced in the country. Therefore, the import of machinery and equipment for the machinery industry is of extremely great significance for socialist industrialization.

    Among the machinery industry, the most important is the manufacture of various machine tools. The country must be able to manufacture various machine tools in large quantities in order to establish an independent machinery industry. At that time, in the total amount of Soviet heavy industrial machinery and equipment, the import of machine tools, the main machinery and equipment of the machinery industry, was the most prominent. In 1929, its proportion in the total import of industrial equipment was 8 percent, and by 1932, this proportion had risen to 26.3 percent.

    Due to the large-scale import of machine tools, the Soviet Union's machine tool manufacturing industry developed rapidly. The Soviet Union's own metal cutting machines only produced more than 1,700 units in 1927-28, but by 1934, it had increased to 21,000 units, and it was already able to manufacture turret lathes, grinding machines, gear milling machines, and composite machine tools in large quantities, and mastered the method of mass production of automatic and semi-automatic machine tools. In this regard, it had completely gotten rid of its dependence on foreign countries and began to change from a country that imported machinery to a country that could produce the machinery and equipment it needed.

    The tractor and agricultural machinery industry is also particularly important. Only by establishing this industry can a large number of tractors and other agricultural machines be produced to complete the socialist transformation of agriculture. Therefore, it became necessary to import machinery and equipment for manufacturing tractors and other agricultural machines in order to establish the country's tractor and agricultural machinery industry. At that time, the import of machinery and equipment for manufacturing tractors and other agricultural machines also occupied a significant position in the import of Soviet heavy industrial machinery and equipment.

    Regarding the import of machinery and equipment for manufacturing tractors and modern agricultural machines, during the first five-year plan period, the Soviet Union spent a total of 320 million rubles in foreign exchange to establish the three tractor factories in Stalingrad, Kharkov, and Chelyabinsk, thus possessing the world's largest tractor industry. The Soviet Union's large-scale import of machinery and equipment for manufacturing tractors and other agricultural machines to establish its own tractor and agricultural machinery industry was not only the correct method, but also the most cost-effective. In 1934, the Soviet Union's tractor production amounted to 88,000 units, exceeding the total number of tractors imported from 1923-1924 to 1931, i.e., in eight years, by more than 4,000 units, while the import of tractors in these eight years cost a total of about 1 billion rubles in foreign exchange.

    The manufacture of transportation machinery is also very important, because this is the key to the technical transformation of the transportation industry. But only by importing machines for manufacturing transportation tools can transportation tools be produced in large quantities, and thus the import of transportation tools can be stopped. Taking automobiles as an example, automobile manufacturing is a very complex industry. The Soviet Union could not manufacture so many specialized equipment at that time. Therefore, during the first five-year plan period, it spent more than 310 million rubles in foreign exchange to import equipment for manufacturing automobiles to establish the Stalin Automobile Factory in Moscow and the Molotov Automobile Factory in Gorky City. After its own automobile industry was established, the Soviet Union's automobile production reached more than 23,800 units in 1932, reducing the import of automobiles from 6,600 units in 1930 to more than 970 units in that year. And since 1936, it has not only stopped importing, but also exported some automobiles abroad.

    Socialist industrialization does not take the development of light industry as the main link, but requires light industry to be able to adapt to the development of heavy industry. Therefore, the proportion of imported light industrial machinery and equipment in the total import of industrial equipment was very small at that time. In 1929-1930, it accounted for 16.1 percent, and in 1931, it accounted for 4.8 percent.

    In terms of the import of light industrial raw materials and consumer goods, the Soviet Union resolutely implemented the policy of "increasing the import of means of production as much as possible and reducing the import of consumer goods" during the industrialization process. During the first five-year plan period, the proportion of imported light industrial raw materials in the total import amount decreased from 27.1 percent in 1929 to 7.1 percent in 1932. The import of consumer goods also decreased from 10.2 percent in 1929 to 4.6 percent in 1931. This policy of "increasing the import of means of production as much as possible and reducing the import of consumer goods" was of extreme importance for the Soviet Union to realize socialist industrialization and for using limited foreign exchange to promote the rapid development of heavy industry in order to achieve complete economic independence. In 1935, Stalin gave this measure a correct evaluation, saying: "We could perhaps have used the 300 million gold rubles that we obtained through strict economization not to create a national industry, but to import raw materials and increase the production of daily necessities. This is also a 'plan'. But if we had adopted this 'plan', then we would have had no metallurgy, machinery manufacturing, tractors and automobiles, airplanes and tanks. Then we would have become unarmed people in the face of foreign enemies. Then we would have destroyed the foundation of our socialism." ("Speech at the Graduation Ceremony of the Red Army Academy Students in the Kremlin")

    In addition to solving the machinery and equipment needed for socialist industrialization, foreign trade can also provide some profits, becoming a source of industrialization capital accumulation. Taking 1925 as an example, Soviet foreign trade obtained a profit of 44 million rubles to help the realization of socialist industrialization.

    II.

    The progress of Soviet industrialization depended on the import of a large number of machines and equipment from abroad. To enable the large-scale import of machines and equipment, all measures must be taken to expand exports. Because, under the circumstances of a lack of foreign loans, a lack of credit, etc., the capital imported from abroad was not completely non-existent, but was very small. Only by expanding exports could a large amount of foreign exchange needed to purchase foreign machines be obtained. Therefore, the development of export trade "means an increase in the possibility of purchasing machine equipment for our industry and machines and agricultural tools for agriculture from foreign countries, that is to say, it increases the possibility of accelerating the transition of our economy to a new technical basis." ("Resolution of the Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in October 1925")

    In order to obtain the foreign exchange needed to import a large number of machines, the Soviet Union took many effective measures to expand exports: for exported agricultural products, attention was paid to increasing the construction of granaries and cold storages, and developing processing and standardization work. For exported industrial products, attention was paid to the specialization of these factories so that various brands of goods reached consistency and standardization. For low-profit commodities, special funds were established to encourage their export. In addition, corresponding transportation organizations were developed to facilitate the expansion of export trade.

    The Soviet Union had certain principles for exporting materials. The principle was to expand exports as much as possible without harming the needs of the broad masses of people for food, clothing, etc. At that time, Stalin said: "We cannot say as in the old days: 'Even if we can't eat enough ourselves, we must export.' We cannot say this, because workers and peasants must eat like human beings, and we fully support them in this regard. But we can still take all measures to increase our exports and enable the state to maintain a certain foreign exchange reserve without harming the people's consumption." ("On the Soviet Economic Situation and the Party's Policy")

    The commodities exported by the Soviet Union at that time were mainly oil, timber, and grain. In 1930, these three commodities accounted for more than 50 percent of the total exports. Regarding the issue of exporting oil and other mineral products in exchange for foreign materials, Lenin said as early as 1921: "Do not be stingy: let tens of millions of the most valuable mineral products be shipped to foreign countries." ("Letter to Comrades Communist Party Members of Azerbaijan, Georgia, Armenia, Dagestan, and the Gorsky Republic") At the Fifteenth Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), Kuibyshev also demanded that all measures be taken to accelerate this most important export as soon as possible for oil, and demanded that the export of timber increase by 11 percent compared to before the war in five years. As for grain, with the development of state farms and collective farms, socialized agriculture had more grain available for export, which provided a reliable basis for the realization of the export plan. For example, in 1930, the state purchased 1.35 billion poods of grain, while before agricultural collectivization, it could only purchase 500 to 600 million poods per year.

    In addition to exporting the above-mentioned materials, the Soviet Labor and Defense Council also urged cooperatives and state-owned organizations in 1928 to strengthen the procurement of sausage casings and waste materials, etc., and the discovery of new commodities, and suggested using private merchants and absorbing poor urban and rural residents to participate in the procurement work in order to expand the source of goods as much as possible and develop these "secondary exports."

    The Soviet Union encountered very significant difficulties in exporting the above-mentioned materials, because at that time, the capitalist economic crisis, the low price of agricultural products, and the imperialists' rejection of Soviet products were all unfavorable conditions for the sale of Soviet products in the world market. In order to overcome these unfavorable conditions, the Soviet government took many measures and carried out arduous struggles, and finally successfully completed the export task. In the four years of the first five-year plan alone, export trade obtained more than 11 billion rubles in foreign exchange, ensuring the large-scale import of machinery and equipment and important metals, and promoting the smooth progress of socialist industrialization.

    Due to the adoption of correct export policies, the development of Soviet export trade played an important role in the growth of agricultural production, the expansion and consolidation of domestic market commodity circulation, and the consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance.

    With the victory of Soviet industrialization, on the one hand, the comparison between agricultural products and industrial products exported by the Soviet Union changed year by year. Industrial products accounted for only 38 percent of the total export amount in 1922-1923, but it had increased to 85 percent in 1936. On the other hand, before the realization of socialist industrialization, the purpose of Soviet exports was mainly to obtain the foreign exchange needed to pay for imports. With the progress of industrialization, the nature of this export gradually disappeared, and the export amount was also greatly reduced. For example, taking the export volume in 1929 as 100, it had been reduced to 89 in 1935, and even further reduced to 64.5 in 1938. This shows that after the realization of socialist industrialization, Soviet products first need to meet the ever-increasing material and cultural needs of the people, and only very abundant products are exported abroad. As Mikoyan said at the Eighteenth Party Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), when the Soviet Union "was still backward and poor, and there was no developed machinery manufacturing industry, but industry had to be built anyway, we had to export many raw materials and food to foreign countries, even though we ourselves needed these things, but exporting them could obtain foreign exchange to buy machine tools for industry and equipment for tractor factories and automobile factories." After the realization of socialist industrialization, "whether it is butter, vegetable oil, whether it is eggs, pickled pork... we will no longer export it, because we want to expand our domestic consumption. There are more and more things in our stores, and those high-quality goods that used to be exported are also on display in our stores."

    III.

    In order to realize the expansion of exports, so as to obtain the large-scale import of machinery and equipment, thereby being able to "assist and stimulate the development of domestic productive forces to the greatest extent," and at the same time, in order to "defend the socialist economy under construction and protect it from the economic attacks of capitalist countries," the Soviet Union resolutely implemented the monopoly system of foreign trade. The decree signed by Lenin and Stalin on April 22, 1918, and the Soviet Constitution promulgated in 1936, all stipulated that all foreign trade was monopolized by the state. This system is: the state specially sets up the Ministry of Foreign Trade to implement the state's policies and laws on foreign trade, lead and supervise the implementation of import and export plans, and the work of the affiliated import and export companies and commercial representative offices stationed in foreign countries, and represent the state in signing trade agreements with foreign countries. As for the actual business of import and export, it is operated by various specialized import and export companies.

    Due to the implementation of the monopoly system of foreign trade, Soviet foreign trade was able to promote the development of domestic productive forces to the greatest extent according to its own plans and according to the requirements of various stages of national economic development. From 1926 to 1934, the large-scale import of machines and equipment accelerated industrialization and agricultural collectivization. During the second five-year plan, with the completion of the technical transformation of the national economy, the import of machines was reduced, and the import of raw materials such as wool and leather, as well as food such as coffee and fruits, was increased to meet the ever-increasing material needs of the Soviet people.

    As Lenin said, in the era of imperialism, in the era when there is still a big difference between poor and weak countries and rich and strong countries, "apart from the method of foreign trade monopoly, ... any serious tariff policy is out of the question." ("Letter to Comrade Stalin regarding the issue of foreign trade monopoly, forwarded to the Plenary Session of the Central Committee") Because any rich and strong country can completely destroy this tariff protection by adopting export promotion methods, thereby destroying the Soviet Union's industry. Therefore, the Soviet Union resolutely implemented the monopoly system of foreign trade, enabling the state to conduct foreign trade independently and autonomously, so that the developing Soviet industry would not be attacked by foreign capital, and so that the state's planned economy would not be affected by the capitalist economic crisis and market fluctuations. At the same time, because all foreign trade is in the hands of the state, unity of action can be achieved in foreign economic activities.

    IV.

    Our country is also currently struggling to realize socialist industrialization. Our country's economy is even more backward than Russia's at that time, and many heavy-duty machines and precision machines cannot yet be manufactured domestically. Under these circumstances, it is also absolutely necessary to import machinery and equipment from abroad to meet the needs of socialist industrialization.

    When importing machinery and equipment from abroad, we must first estimate the current international environment in which our country is located. Needless to say, the current international environment in which our country is located is more favorable than that of the Soviet Union at that time. Because the Soviet Union has already become a great socialist industrial country, and the industries of the people's democratic countries in Europe are also relatively developed. The machinery and equipment needed for our country's socialist industrialization can mostly be imported from the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries.

    But to purchase these machines and equipment in large quantities, we must expand exports. Only by expanding the amount of exports can we exchange for a large amount of imported equipment. For major export commodities, in addition to actively increasing production and appropriately supplying domestic needs, we should also try to squeeze out a portion to increase exports; for commodities that can be sold well abroad and save domestic consumption with little impact, we should take all measures to open up sources of goods and export them in large quantities. For example, exporting ten tons of frozen pork can exchange for a tractor, and exporting 19,000 tons of peanuts can exchange for a complete set of equipment for a 25,000-kilowatt thermal power plant. Why can't we eat less pork and peanuts to exchange for these machines to accelerate the country's industrialization? On the other hand, due to the implementation of foreign trade control and trade protection policies, our country has eliminated the semi-colonial dependence of foreign trade and has changed from a long-term import surplus to a country with a balance of exports and imports. Under these conditions, it is also necessary to conduct trade with capitalist countries in accordance with the principle of equality and mutual benefit to exchange for the materials needed for our country's socialist industrialization. Therefore, today, deeply studying Lenin's and Stalin's instructions on foreign trade issues, seriously learning from the achievements and experiences of the Soviet Union in this regard, and combining them with the current actual situation in our country, and further improving foreign trade work, is of great significance for the realization of our country's socialist industrialization.

    苏联对外贸易怎样为社会主义工业化服务
    曾高
    一
    苏联在国民经济恢复时期结束以后，就开始进入社会主义工业化的新时期。机器设备的充分供应，是实现社会主义工业化极其重要的条件。但在当时，苏联还是一个技术落后的国家，它没有充分的机器来供给工业、农业、运输业，没有对国民经济实行技术改造的物质条件。当时“如不拿俄罗斯现有的原料交换西方国家的机器和装备品，那么，俄罗斯用自己的力量很难建立运输业，很难发展工业与电气化城乡工业”。（斯大林：“党在夺取政权底前后”）为了实现发展国民经济的远大计划，为了使苏联由农业国变为工业国，列宁曾指出，必须尽快地获得购买必要机器的可能。这件事做得愈快，那苏联不依赖资本主义国家而在经济上独立的基础就会愈大。（“在俄国共产党（布）第八次苏维埃代表大会小组会议上关于租让制的报告”）
    遵照列宁斯大林的指示，在实现国家工业化的过程中，苏联的对外贸易担负起由国外输入机器以加速工业化建设的任务。仅在第一个五年计划时期的四年中，苏联输入的机器设备即达七十一亿九千多万卢布之巨，成为世界上进口机器设备最多的国家，在一九三二年，它曾购买世界全部机器输出额的半数左右（汽车不算在内）。当时资本主义国家正处于经济危机的困境中，英、德等国的大机器厂几乎全靠苏联定货开工。不难看出，这样巨大数量的机器，通过对外贸易流入苏联，对于苏联工业的成长壮大会起多么重大的作用。
    当时苏联并不随便输入任何机器，而是按照社会主义工业化的需要来输入。社会主义工业化的中心环节是发展重工业。因此，在对外贸易方面，也就着重输入重工业的机器设备。从第一个五年计划开始，一直到社会主义工业化的实现，重工业的机器设备的输入，在全部工业机器设备的进口总额中所占的比重，都是很大的。一九二九—一九三○年，它占百分之八一点五，一九三一年，则已占百分之九三点五了。
    机械工业是重工业的核心，要发展重工业，必须首先抓住这个核心。只有抓住这个核心，在本国建立强大的机械工业，才能使本国自力出产必需的机器设备，才能利用本国出产的各种机器设备来全面地发展各种轻重工业和其他经济部门。因此，机械工业机器设备的输入，对于社会主义工业化是具有极其重大意义的。
    在机械工业中，最重要的是各种机床的制造。必须使本国能够大量制造各种机床，才能建立起独立的机械工业。在当时苏联的重工业机器设备总额中，是以机械工业的主要机器设备——机床的输入最为突出的，一九二九年，它在全部工业设备的进口总额中的比重为百分之八，到了一九三二年，这种比重已经上升到百分之二六点三了。
    由于机床的大量输入，使苏联的机床制造业迅速地发展起来。苏联自己制造的金属切削机，在一九二七—二八年只生产一千七百多架，到了一九三四年就已经增加到二万一千架，而且已经能够大量制造转塔车床、碾磨机床、齿轮铣床、复合机床，掌握自动机床与半自动机床大量生产的方法，在这方面已完全摆脱了对外国的依赖，并开始由一个输入机器的国家变为一个能出产自己必需的机器设备的国家了。
    拖拉机和农业机械工业也是特别重要的。建立了这种工业，才能出产大量的拖拉机和其他农业机器，来完成农业的社会主义改造。因此，输入制造拖拉机和其他农业机器的机器设备，来建立本国的拖拉机和农业机械工业，就成为必要了。在当时苏联的重工业机械设备输入中，制造拖拉机和其他农业机器的机器设备的输入也占显著的地位。
    关于输入制造拖拉机与现代农业机器的机器设备，在第一个五年计划时期，苏联为建立斯大林格勒、哈尔科夫、齐良宾斯克三个拖拉机工厂，一共花费了三亿二千万卢布的外汇，这样它就拥有了世界上最大的拖拉机工业。苏联大量输入制造拖拉机和其他农业机器的机器设备，以建立本国的拖拉机和农业机械工业，不但是正确的办法，而且是最合算的。一九三四年苏联拖拉机的产量计有八万八千架，比一九二三—一九二四年至一九三一年，即八年中输入的拖拉机总数超出了四千架，而这八年输入拖拉机却一共花费了十亿卢布左右的外汇。
    交通运输机械的制造，也是很重要的，因为这是交通运输业得以进行技术改造的关键。但只有输入制造交通工具的机器，才能大量生产交通工具，并因此而杜绝交通工具的输入。以汽车为例，汽车制造是非常复杂的一种工业，苏联当时还不能制造这许多专门设备，因此，在第一个五年计划时期，曾花费了三亿一千多万卢布的外汇，输入制造汽车的设备，以建立莫斯科的斯大林汽车工厂和高尔基城的莫洛托夫汽车工厂。在自己的汽车工业建立起来以后，苏联制造的汽车，一九三二年就已达到二万三千八百多辆的产量，使输入的汽车由一九三○年的六千六百辆减少到这一年的九百七十多辆。而自一九三六年起，不仅已经停止输入，并且有一些汽车输出国外了。
    社会主义工业化，不是以发展轻工业为主要环节，而是要求轻工业能够适应于重工业的发展，因此，当时轻工业机器设备的输入在全部工业设备的进口总额中所占的比重是很小的。一九二九—一九三○年，它占百分之一六点一，一九三一年，它占百分之四点八。
    在轻工业原料和消费品输入的方面，苏联在工业化过程中，坚决执行尽量“增加生产资料的输入，减少消费品的输入”的政策。在第一个五年计划时期轻工业原料的输入在输入总额中所占的比重，由一九二九年的百分之二七点一降为一九三二年的百分之七点一。消费品的输入也由一九二九年的百分之一○点二降为一九三一年的百分之四点六。这种尽量“增加生产资料的输入，减少消费品的输入”的政策，对于苏联实现社会主义工业化，对于利用有限的外汇来促进重工业的迅速发展，以达到经济上的完全独立，具有极端重要的意义。斯大林在一九三五年，曾给予这一措施以正确的评价，他说：“我们当时也许是能不把我们用严格节省方法获得的三十万万金卢布拿去创立国家工业，而用去输入原料并增加日用品的生产。这也是一种‘计划’。可是，如果我们采用了这种‘计划’，那我们就会没有什么冶金业，机器制造业，拖拉机和汽车，飞机和坦克了。那我们在外来敌人面前就会成为手无寸铁的人了。那我们就会破坏了我国社会主义底基础了。”（“在克里姆林宫举行的红军学院学生毕业典礼大会上的演说”）
    对外贸易除了解决社会主义工业化所需要的机器设备以外，还能提供若干利润，成为工业化资金积累的一种来源。就拿一九二五年来说，苏联对外贸易就获得了四千四百万卢布的利润，来帮助社会主义工业化的实现。
    二
    苏联工业化的进展，有赖于由国外输入大量的机器及设备，而要使机器及设备大量输入，必须采取一切办法，以扩大输出。因为，在当时缺乏外国借款的情形下，在缺乏信贷等等的情形下，从国外输入进来的资本不是完全没有，便是为数极少，只有扩大输出，才能取得大量购买外国机器所需的外汇。因此输出贸易的发展就“意味着从外国为我国工业购买机器装备，为农业购买机器与农具的可能性增大了，也就是说使我国经济加速过渡到新的技术基础之可能性增大了”。（“一九二五年十月俄共
  （布）中央委员会全会决议”）
    为了获取大量输入机器所需的外汇，苏联曾采取许多有效措施来扩大输出：对于出口的农产品，注意增建谷仓，冷藏库，发展加工与标准化的工作。对于出口的工业品，注意这些工厂的专业化，使各种牌号的商品达到一致与标准化。对于低利的商品，设立专门基金，鼓励其输出。此外，还发展相应的运输组织，以便利输出贸易的扩大。
    苏联输出物资，是有一定原则的。这个原则，就是在不损害广大人民吃穿等需要的条件下，尽量扩大输出。当时斯大林曾说：“我们不能像旧时那样地说：‘自己吃不饱，也得要输出’。我们不能这样说，因为工人和农民要像人样地吃饭，而我们在这一点上是完全支持他们的。但是我们仍然可以在对人民消费无损的条件下，采取一切办法，使我国输出增加，使国家手中能保持一定的外汇准备金。”（“论苏联经济状况和党底政策”）
    苏联当时输出的商品，以石油、木材、谷物最为重要，一九三○年，这三项商品曾占输出总额百分之五十以上。对于输出石油及其他矿产品以换取外国物资问题，列宁还在一九二一年就说：“不要吝啬：就让几千万最贵重的矿产品运到外国去吧”。
  （“致阿捷尔拜疆、格鲁吉亚、阿尔明尼亚、达格斯坦、哥里共和国共产党员同志们的信”）在联共（布）十五次代表大会上，古比雪夫也要求对于石油采取一切办法尽快地加速这一项最重要的输出，并要求对于木材的输出在五年中比战前增加百分之十一。至于谷物，随着国营农场与集体农庄的发展，社会化的农业有更多的谷物可供输出，也就为输出计划的实现提供了可靠的基础。例如一九三○年国家采购的谷物为十三亿五千万普特，而在农业集体化以前，每年只能采购五亿至六亿普特。
    除了输出上述物资以外，苏联劳动国防会议在一九二八年还督促合作社和国营组织，加强对肠衣及废物、废料等商品的采购工作和新商品的发现工作，建议利用私商、吸收城乡贫民参加采购工作，以便尽量扩大货源，发展这些“次要的输出”。
    苏联输出上述物资，遭到很重大的困难，因为在当时，资本主义经济危机，农产品价格低落，帝国主义者对苏联产品的排斥等等，都是苏联产品在世界市场上推销的不利条件。为要克服这些不利条件，苏联政府曾采取了许多措施，进行了艰苦的斗争，终于胜利地完成输出的任务。仅在第一个五年计划时期的四年中，输出贸易就获得了一百一十亿卢布以上的外汇，保证了机器设备及重要金属的大量输入，促成社会主义工业化的顺利进行。
    由于采取了正确的输出政策，苏联输出贸易的发展，对于农业生产的增长，对于国内市场商品流转的扩大和巩固，对于巩固工农联盟，都起了重要的作用。
    随着苏联工业化的胜利，一方面苏联输出的农产品与工业品的对比关系逐年变化，工业品在输出总额中，一九二二—一九二三年仅占百分之三十八，一九三六年则已增至百分之八十五。另一方面，在实现社会主义工业化之前，苏联输出的目的，主要是为了获取支付输入所需的外汇。随着工业化的进展，这种输出的性质日益消失，而输出额也大量缩减了。如以一九二九年输出数量为一百，一九三五年已减至八九，一九三八年更减为六四点五。这就表明，在实现社会主义工业化以后，苏联产品首先要满足本国人民日益提高的物质需要和文化需要，只以非常充裕的产品输往国外。正如米高扬在联共（布）十八次党代表大会上所说，当苏联“还是落后和贫困，还没有发达的机器制造业，而无论如何工业又必须建设的时期，我们只好把许多原料和食品输出到国外去，虽然我们自己也需要这些东西，但是把它们输出去可以获得外汇，用来购买工业用的机床，购买拖拉机工厂和汽车工厂的设备”。而实现了社会主义工业化以后，则“无论牛油、植物油，无论鸡蛋、腌猪肉……我们都不再出口了，因为我们要扩大本国的消费量，我们商店里的东西日益增多，而且从前拿去出口的那些品质优良的商品也摆在我们的商店里了”。
    三
    为了实现扩大输出，以取得机器设备的大量输入，从而能“最大限度地协助与刺激国内生产力的发展”，同时，为了“保卫正在建设中的社会主义经济，使之免受资本主义国家的经济袭击”，苏联坚决实行对外贸易垄断制。一九一八年四月二十二日列宁、斯大林签署的法令，一九三六年颁布的苏联宪法，都规定一切对外贸易统由国家垄断经营。这种制度是：国家特设对外贸易部，执行国家在对外贸易方面的政策及法令，领导与监督输出入计划的实行以及所属出进口公司与驻外国商务代表处的工作，代表国家和外国签订贸易协定。至于出进口实际业务，则由各种专业化的进出口公司经营。
    由于实行对外贸易垄断制，苏联对外贸易得以根据国民经济各个发展阶段的要求，按照自己的计划，最大限度地促进国内生产力的发展。从一九二六到一九三四年，大量输入机器及装备，加速了工业化与农业集体化。第二个五年计划年代，随着国民经济技术改造的完成，减少了机器的输入，增加了羊毛、皮革等原料以及咖啡、水果等食品的输入，以满足苏联人民日益提高的物质需要。
    正如列宁所说，在帝国主义时代，在贫弱国家与富强国家还存在很大差别的时代，“除了对外贸易垄断方法外，……任何认真的关税政策都是谈不上的”。（“就对外贸易垄断问题致斯大林同志转中央委员会全会的信”）因为任何一个富强国家只要采取奖励输出的办法，都可以把这种关税保护完全摧毁，从而摧毁苏联的工业。因此，苏联坚决实行对外贸易垄断制，使国家能独立自主地进行对外贸易，使正在发展中的苏联工业不受外国资本的袭击，并使国家的计划经济不受资本主义经济危机与行情波动的影响。同时，由于对外贸易全部掌握在国家手中，在对外经济活动上能取得行动一致。

    我国目前也正在为实现社会主义工业化而斗争。我国的经济比当时的俄国还要落后，许多重型机器和精密机器还不能由本国制造，在这种情况下，从国外输入机器设备，以供应社会主义工业化的需要，也是绝对必要的。
    从国外输入机器设备，必须首先估计我国目前所处的国际环境。不用多说，我国目前所处的国际环境，比当时苏联是更加有利的。由于苏联已经成为一个伟大的社会主义工业国家，欧洲各人民民主国家的工业也比较发达。我国社会主义工业化所需要的机器设备，其大部分就可以从苏联和各人民民主国家输入了。
    但要大量购买这些机器设备，必须扩大输出，只有扩大输出的数额才能换回大量的输入器材。对于主要出口商品，除应积极增产并适当供应国内需要而外，还应设法挤出一部分来增加输出；对于在国外可以畅销而节约国内消费影响不大的商品，则应采取一切办法开辟货源，大量输出。例如，输出十吨冻猪肉可以换回一部拖拉机，输出一万九千吨花生仁可以换回一座二万五千瓩的火力发电厂全套设备，我们为什么不能少吃点猪肉和花生来换回这些机器以加速国家的工业化呢？另一方面，由于对外贸易管制和保护贸易政策的贯彻，我国已经肃清了对外贸易的半殖民地的依赖性，由长期入超变为输出入平衡的国家。在这种条件下，按照平等互利的原则，和资本主义国家进行贸易，换得我国社会主义工业化所需要的物资也是必要的。因此，在今天，深入地钻研列宁、斯大林关于对外贸易问题的指示，认真学习苏联在这方面所取得的成就和经验，结合我国目前实际状况，进一步做好对外贸易工作，对于我国社会主义工业化的实现，是具有重大意义的。
