    Our Premier Zhou Enlai, at the invitation of Indian Prime Minister Nehru and Burmese Prime Minister U Nu, successively visited India and Burma and held friendly talks with the two Prime Ministers respectively. This is a major event in today's Asian international relations, attracting widespread reaction and universal attention from public opinion in Asia and around the world.
    The talks held separately by the Chinese and Indian Prime Ministers and the Chinese and Burmese Prime Ministers mark a further development of peaceful and friendly relations among Asian countries. The Chinese and Indian, and Chinese and Burmese peoples have always had traditional, deep friendship and close economic and cultural relations. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and India, and China and Burma respectively, based on equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, has led to new development of the friendship that already existed between China and India, and China and Burma. The Prime Ministerial talks held separately this time have achieved positive results in further strengthening mutual friendship, especially in mutual understanding and cooperation in promoting peace in Southeast Asia and the world. The continuous enhancement of friendly relations between China and India, and China and Burma, will greatly help consolidate peace in Asia and the world.
    The joint statement of the Chinese and Indian Prime Ministers emphasized the importance of the five principles governing relations between the two countries, as stipulated in the Sino-Indian Agreement on Trade and Communications between the Tibet region of China and India in April this year. These five principles are: mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence. The two Prime Ministers believe that these principles are applicable not only to their relations with other countries in Asia and the world, but also to general international relations. The joint statement of the Chinese and Indian Prime Ministers stated: "The two Prime Ministers especially hope that these principles will be applied to the resolution of the Indochina issue. The political settlement in Indochina should aim at creating free, democratic, unified and independent states. These countries should not be used for aggressive purposes, nor should they be subject to external interference. This will increase the confidence of these countries and lead to friendly relations between these countries and between them and their neighbors."
    The joint statement of the Chinese and Burmese Prime Ministers also agreed that the above five principles should be the principles guiding the relations between China and Burma. The two countries also reiterated their position of striving to promote peace throughout the world, especially in Southeast Asia, and expressed the hope that the issue of restoring peace in Indochina, which is being discussed in Geneva, will be satisfactorily resolved.
    The joint statement of the Chinese and Indian Prime Ministers and the joint statement of the Chinese and Burmese Prime Ministers unanimously pointed out that if these five principles are accepted and abided by by all countries, then countries with different social systems and political systems can coexist peacefully. The joint statement of the Chinese and Indian Prime Ministers stated: "Different social systems and political systems exist in Asia and around the world. However, if the above principles are accepted and acted upon, and no country interferes with another, these differences should not become obstacles to peace or cause conflicts. With the territorial sovereignty and non-aggression of each of the countries concerned guaranteed, these countries can coexist peacefully and be friendly to each other. This will ease the tensions that currently exist in the world and help create an atmosphere of peace." The joint statement of the Chinese and Burmese Prime Ministers stated: "If these principles can be observed by all countries, then the peaceful coexistence of countries with different social systems will be guaranteed, and the threat of aggression and interference in internal affairs, and the fear of aggression and interference in internal affairs, will be replaced by a sense of security and mutual trust."
    Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, China's diplomatic relations have opened a new page. Our country has established a close, fraternal, and completely new type of friendly and cooperative relationship with the socialist Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries. The establishment and continuous consolidation of this relationship has become a reliable pillar for maintaining peace in Asia and the world. The foreign policy of our government has always advocated striving to establish friendly and cooperative relations with all countries with different social and political systems on the basis of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect for territorial sovereignty. The Chinese people, who have mastered their own national destiny, deeply understand the urgent significance of defending national security, striving for a peaceful environment, and building their own great motherland from their own and other Asian nations' painful experience of prolonged colonialist aggression and oppression. We do not invade others, and we resolutely oppose any act of aggression; we do not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, and we resolutely oppose any act of interference in internal affairs; we advocate peace and believe that different social and political systems can coexist peacefully. As our Premier Zhou Enlai said at a press conference in New Delhi: "All countries in the world, regardless of size or strength, regardless of their social systems, can coexist peacefully. The national independence and autonomous rights of all peoples must be respected. All peoples should have the right to choose their national system and way of life, and should not be subject to interference from other countries. Revolution cannot be exported; at the same time, the common will expressed by the people within a country should not be allowed to be interfered with by external forces. If all countries in the world handle their relations with each other according to these principles, then the situation in which one country threatens or invades another will not occur, and the possibility of peaceful coexistence among all countries in the world will become a reality." Because our country has consistently pursued this peaceful foreign policy, it has received the sympathy and support of all peace-loving countries and peoples.
    Now, the positive results achieved in the talks held separately by the Chinese and Indian Prime Ministers and the Chinese and Burmese Prime Ministers show that these five principles are beginning to have a wider impact in international relations in Asia and the world. The friendly relations among Asian countries that are being enhanced on the basis of these principles are a powerful response to the aggressive conspiracies of the US ruling clique to create hostile military blocs in Asia to threaten peace and security in Asia.
    The principle that countries with different social and political systems can coexist peacefully is fundamentally incompatible with the so-called policy of strength pursued by US imperialism. The purpose of the US imperialists' policy of strength is to conquer the whole world and make all countries in the world into US colonies and dependencies. The ferocity, ruthlessness, and arrogance of US imperialism are already well known. The recent aggression against Guatemala is another example. When carrying out aggression, US imperialism uses "opposing the threat of communism" as a cover. The so-called "threat of communism" in Guatemala is nothing more than the just struggle of the masses of people against the US "United Fruit Company." US imperialism is frantically shouting that there is also a "threat of communism" in Southeast Asia. Its purpose is to carry out large-scale aggression in Southeast Asia, "using Asians to fight Asians," plundering the people of Southeast Asia, and squeezing out British and French forces. This arrogant plan of US imperialism has seriously threatened the people of Southeast Asian countries and threatened the interests of Britain and France.
    The people of Asia love peace. The threat of aggression in Asia is external. Asia has long suffered from imperialist colonial rule and oppression. The national independence and autonomous rights of the people of Asian countries, as well as their right to choose their national system and way of life, have been brutally deprived and trampled upon by foreign aggressive forces. Now, colonialism in Asia should end, and the era in which Asian countries establish peaceful coexistence and friendly relations with each other on the basis of respect for territorial sovereignty and non-aggression has arrived. The US ruling clique, disregarding the wishes of the Asian people and the reality of Asia, is still trying to impose the shackles of colonialism on the heads of Asian countries. In order to achieve this goal, they launched the Korean War, and after the war of aggression against Korea was stopped, they are now plotting to expand the war in Indochina. However, these blatant aggressors are still trying to conceal their aggressive actions, repeating the old tune of the so-called "communist threat." They describe the movement of people in various countries to fight for independence and freedom as "communist expansion" and try to suppress it, so that the people of Asian countries can continue to be ruled and enslaved by foreign colonialism. However, this lie of the imperialists can no longer deceive anyone.
    All governments and peoples who are concerned about peace and who safeguard their national sovereignty and independence will not fail to see the fact that, at the same time as the Chinese and Indian Prime Ministers and the Chinese and Burmese Prime Ministers held separate talks and issued joint statements, Washington was also holding a meeting and issued a joint statement. Although the statement of the Washington talks also talked about "seeking world peace," they announced that the goal they were determined to achieve was to establish the so-called European Defense Group and to strive to promote the so-called collective defense plan in Southeast Asia. People know that these plans to establish so-called defense groups or collective defense are to create hostile military blocs in Europe and Asia, and are plans to infringe upon the sovereignty and independence of European and Asian countries. This is not only incompatible with the task of seeking peace in Asia and the world, but also completely violates the principle of peaceful coexistence of different political and social systems. This clearly shows where the threat to peace in Asia and the world comes from.
    Two meetings, two results. The talks held separately by our Premier and the Prime Ministers of India and Burma were filled with a warm and friendly atmosphere and were warmly welcomed by the broad masses of people. The US-British talks showed that the differences between the two countries are becoming increasingly irreconcilable. The communique of this Anglo-American meeting did not mention a word about the Middle East issue, over which the two sides are fiercely fighting, and was vague about Southeast Asia. Isn't it obvious that the impending US economic crisis and the US's arrogant aggression are intensifying the contradictions between the US and Britain?
    It is precisely because of this that the US ruling clique, which is plotting to promote plans for aggressive war and to establish a colonial empire in Asia, is very afraid of the talks between the Chinese and Indian, and Chinese and Burmese Prime Ministers, and is afraid of the strengthening of unity among Asian countries in the cause of peace. The enemies of peace know that if Asian countries and countries around the world jointly shoulder the responsibility of maintaining peace, their plans to invade Asia and dominate the world will come to nothing.
    The talks held separately by the Chinese and Indian Prime Ministers and the Chinese and Burmese Prime Ministers vividly embody the peaceful foreign policy pursued by the People's Republic of China, as well as the peaceful aspirations of the governments and peoples of India and Burma. World public opinion generally attaches importance to the enhancement of Sino-Indian and Sino-Burmese friendship and their peace efforts, and believes that this will greatly increase the chances of peace. The unity and cooperation of peace-loving people and countries in Asia in the cause of peace cannot be stopped by any force. The continuous strengthening of this cooperation will not only establish a solid and lasting peace in Asia, but will also promote the cause of consolidating lasting world peace.

### 保证各国和平共处的正确原则

    保证各国和平共处的正确原则
    我国周恩来总理应印度总理尼赫鲁和缅甸总理吴努的邀请，先后访问了印度和缅甸，并和两国总理分别举行了友好会谈。这是今天亚洲国际关系中的重大事件，引起了亚洲和世界各国舆论的广泛反应和普遍重视。
    中印两国总理和中缅两国总理分别举行的会谈，标志着亚洲各国和平友好关系的进一步发展。中国和印度、缅甸人民之间一贯有着传统的深厚的友谊和密切的经济和文化关系。自中华人民共和国建国以来，中印和中缅分别在平等互利和互相尊重领土主权的基础上建立的外交关系，使已经存在于中印和中缅之间的友谊得到了新的发展。这次分别举行的总理会谈，更为加强相互之间的友谊，特别是在促进东南亚和全世界的和平事业中的互相了解和合作，取得了肯定的成就。中印、中缅之间的友好关系的不断增进，将大大有助于巩固亚洲和世界的和平。
    中印两国总理的联合声明，强调了今年四月间中印两国在关于中国西藏地方和印度之间的通商和交通协定中所规定的两国之间关系的五个原则的重要意义。这五个原则是：互相尊重领土主权，互不侵犯，互不干涉内政，平等互利，和平共处。两国总理认为这些原则不仅适用于他们与亚洲以及世界其他国家的关系中，并且适用于一般国际关系中。中印两国总理联合声明表示：“两国总理特别希望在对印度支那问题的解决中，适用这些原则。在印度支那的政治解决应以创造自由、民主、统一和独立的各个国家为目的。这些国家不应被利用于侵略的目的，也不应受外来的干涉。这将使这些国家的自信增长，并导致这些国家相互之间和它们与其邻国之间的友好关系。”
    中缅两国总理联合声明，也同意上述五个原则应该是指导中国和缅甸之间关系的原则。两国并重申他们将竭力促进全世界的特别是在东南亚的和平的立场，希望正在日内瓦讨论的恢复印度支那和平的问题将得到满意的解决。
    中印两国总理联合声明和中缅两国总理联合声明，一致指出，这五个原则，如果为各国所接受和遵守，那末，不同社会制度和政治制度的国家之间，是可以和平共处的。中印两国总理联合声明中说：“在亚洲及世界各地存在着不同的社会制度和政治制度。然而，如果接受上述各项原则并按照这些原则办事，任何一国又都不干涉另一国，这些差别就不应成为和平的障碍或造成冲突。有关各国中每一个国家的领土主权和互不侵犯有了保证，这些国家就能和平共处并相互友好。这就会缓和目前存在于世界上的紧张局势，并有助于创造和平的气氛。”中缅两国总理联合声明中说：“如果这些原则能为一切国家所遵守，则社会制度不同的国家的和平共处就有了保证，而侵略和干涉内政的威胁和对于侵略和干涉内政的恐惧就将为安全感和互信所代替。”
    中华人民共和国建国以来，中国的外交关系开始了新的一页。我国与社会主义的苏联及其他各人民民主国家之间结成了亲密无间的兄弟般的完全新型的友好合作关系，这个关系的建立及其不断巩固，成了维护亚洲及世界和平的可靠支柱。我国政府的对外政策，又一向主张努力与一切社会政治制度不同的国家在平等互利和互相尊重领土主权的基础上，建立友好合作关系。掌握了自己的国家命运的中国人民，从自己及亚洲各民族长期遭受殖民主义的侵略和压迫的痛苦经验中，深切地了解到捍卫国家安全，争取和平环境，建设自己伟大祖国的迫切意义。我们不侵略别人，也坚决反对任何侵略行为；我们不干涉别国内政，也坚决反对任何干涉别国内政的行为；我们主张和平，认为不同的社会政治制度之间可以和平共处。正如我国周恩来总理在新德里记者招待会上所说的：“世界各国不分大小强弱，不论其社会制度如何，是可以和平共处的。各国人民的民族独立和自主权利是必须得到尊重的。各国人民都应该有选择其国家制度和生活方式的权利，不应受到其他国家的干涉。革命是不能输出的；同时，一个国家内人民表现的共同意志也不应容许外来干涉。如果世界各国都根据这些原则处理他们相互间的关系，那么，这一国家对那一国家进行威胁和侵略的情况就不会发生，世界各国和平共处的可能，就会变成现实。”我国由于一贯奉行这个和平外交政策，得到一切爱好和平的国家和人民的同情和支持。
    现在，中印两国总理和中缅两国总理分别举行的会谈所取得的积极结果，表明了这五个原则正在亚洲及世界的国际关系中开始发生更广泛的影响。在这些原则的基础上增进着的亚洲各国之间的友好关系，是对美国统治集团企图在亚洲制造敌对军事集团来威胁亚洲和平和安全的侵略阴谋的有力回答。
    社会制度政治制度不同的国家可以和平共处的原则，是与美国帝国主义者所谓实力政策根本不相容的。美帝国主义者的实力政策，其目的是要征服全世界，使全世界各国都成为美国的殖民地和附属国。美帝国主义的凶残狠毒，横蛮霸道，已经是人所共知，最近对危地马拉的侵略，又是一个例子。美帝国主义在进行侵略的时候，以“反对共产主义威胁”作为幌子，而所谓“共产主义的威胁”，在危地马拉不过是人民大众反对美国“联合果品公司”的正义斗争而已。美国帝国主义疯狂叫喊说在东南亚也有“共产主义的威胁”，其目的是要在东南亚大肆侵略，“用亚洲人打亚洲人”，掠夺东南亚人民，并排挤英法势力。美帝国主义这种狂妄计划，已严重威胁东南亚各国人民，并威胁英法权益。
    亚洲人民是爱好和平的。亚洲的侵略威胁是外来的。亚洲曾长期遭受帝国主义的殖民统治和压迫，亚洲各国人民的民族独立和自主权利以及他们选择其国家制度和生活方式的权利，都遭到外来侵略势力的横暴剥夺和蹂躏。现在，在亚洲的殖民主义应该结束了，亚洲国家在尊重领土主权和互不侵犯的基础上建立和平共处和相互友好关系的时代到来了。美国统治集团不顾亚洲人民的愿望和亚洲的现实，依然力图把殖民主义的枷锁强加在亚洲国家的头上。为了达到这种目的，他们曾发动了朝鲜战争，并在对朝鲜的侵略战争被制止之后，现在又在图谋扩大印度支那的战争。然而，这些明目张胆的侵略者还力图掩饰他们的侵略行为，重弹所谓“共产主义威胁”的老调，他们把各国人民争取独立自由的运动说成是什么“共产主义的扩张”，力图加以镇压，使亚洲各国人民继续受外来的殖民主义的统治和奴役。然而，帝国主义者的这种谎言再也骗不了人了。
    关心和平和维护自己国家主权和独立的各国政府和人民，都不会不看到这样的事实：就在中印两国总理和中缅两国总理分别举行会谈并发表联合声明的同时，华盛顿也正举行一个会谈，并且也发表了一个联合声明。华盛顿会谈的声明中虽然也谈到要“谋求世界和平”，但是他们却宣布他们决心要达到的目标是建立所谓欧洲防务集团，并且要在东南亚努力推行所谓集体防务计划。人们知道，这些建立所谓防务集团或集体防务的计划就是要在欧洲和亚洲造成敌对的军事集团，就是要侵犯欧洲和亚洲国家的主权和独立的计划，这不但与谋求亚洲和世界和平的任务毫不相容，而且也完全违反了不同的政治和社会制度和平共处的原则。这就再清楚不过地说明了亚洲和世界和平的威胁究竟是来自何方了。
    两种会谈，两种结果。我国总理与印缅两国总理分别举行的会谈，充满了热烈友好的气氛，受到广大人民狂热的欢迎。美英会谈却表示了两国之间的分歧是越来越无法和解了。这次英美会谈的公报，对于双方正在激烈斗争的中东问题，一字不提，对于东南亚，则含糊其辞。已经到来的美国经济危机，和美国的狂妄的侵略，正在使美国与英国之间的矛盾日益加深，不是很明显的么？
    正是因为这样，所以蓄谋推行侵略战争计划和在亚洲建立殖民帝国的美国统治集团，十分害怕中印、中缅总理的会谈，害怕亚洲国家在和平事业中团结的加强。和平的敌人知道，如果亚洲各国和世界各国共同把维护和平的责任担当起来，他们侵略亚洲和称霸世界的计划便将一事无成。
    中印两国总理和中缅两国总理分别举行的会谈，生动地体现了中华人民共和国所奉行的和平外交政策，以及印度、缅甸两国政府和两国人民的和平愿望。世界各国舆论普遍重视中印和中缅友谊的增进，以及他们所作的和平努力，并认为这将大大增强和平的机会。亚洲爱好和平的人民和国家在和平事业中的团结合作，是任何力量所不能阻挡的。这种合作的不断加强，不但将在亚洲建立起巩固和持久的和平，并且将促进巩固世界持久和平的事业。
