    Mother Shi's Report Meeting
    One evening in July, the auditorium of the Shanghai Branch of the People's Bank of China was packed with people who had come to hear Mother Shi's report on the draft Constitution.
    The meeting began, and hundreds of pairs of eyes stared at Shi Xiaomei, a 65-year-old worker, who appeared on the podium. Her temples were slightly gray, and her eyes sparkled. This old warrior had joined the revolutionary struggle twenty-seven years ago. During the "May Thirtieth" Movement, she participated in the heroic struggle of the Shanghai workers, and later participated in the three armed uprisings of the Shanghai workers during the First Revolutionary Civil War. Mother Shi began her report calmly on the stage. She described the scene of repeatedly risking danger to transport weapons across the Huangpu River under the leadership of the Communist Party in those years. She painfully recalled the turbulent years after the "April 12th" Incident in 1927, when Chiang Kai-shek betrayed the revolution, and Shanghai was shrouded in the white terror of "killing wind" and "arresting wind." She said: The Chiang bandit gang came to arrest me several times, forcing me to become homeless. My husband was captured by the reactionaries, my eldest son bravely sacrificed his life for the revolution, and my two younger sons also died because no one took care of them. Speaking of this, she said excitedly: I did not cry. It is an honor for my son to sacrifice for the country. I endured the pain, changed my surname and name, and persisted in the struggle for twenty years. Today, the struggle has finally been victorious. The blood of the revolutionary martyrs has not been shed in vain. The democratic, free, and equal rights exchanged for life are stipulated in the draft Constitution… Then, Mother Shi pointed to the scars on her eyes and told everyone about the abuse and persecution she suffered from the capitalists when she worked under the rule of the reactionaries. She said: In the past, the capitalists said that we workers were "inferior goods," saying something like "The water in the Huangpu River is turbid, and the workers are fractious"; but now labor has become a glorious thing, and laborers are respected everywhere. Isn't it clearly written in the draft Constitution!? She encouraged everyone to use their own hands to hold the oars tightly and speed up rowing so as to transition to a socialist society quickly and steadily. She said humorously and confidently: "Last year, the country started the Five-Year Plan construction. I don't want to lie in a sleeping car and sleep into a socialist society. I also want to compete with you on the locomotive!"
    From the day the draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China was published to July 17th, Mother Shi had given 37 reports. More than 35,000 workers, government cadres, students, PLA soldiers, and neighborhood women had listened to her reports. Now, the dates for booking her to give reports have been scheduled until the end of July. Regardless of the sultry afternoons or stormy nights, Mother Shi always rushed to report tirelessly, sometimes having to rush to two or three meetings a day, and her throat was a little hoarse from speaking. She once said to others: Seeing the draft Constitution is like seeing our history of hard struggle. Many things naturally come to my mind. I want to tell everyone that every word and sentence in the draft Constitution is written in the blood of martyrs, so that everyone knows that the draft Constitution is not easy to come by, and so that everyone can seriously discuss the draft Constitution. Mother Shi has only learned to write in recent years, and now she is able to prepare lectures in simple language. She can already recite some of the articles in the draft Constitution. She said that the draft Constitution expresses the people's wishes. How can we be worthy of being masters of our own affairs if we don't study it carefully?
    Many workers, Young Pioneers, and government staff members wrote letters to Mother Shi after listening to her report. Mother Shi often put on her reading glasses and read these letters with a smile. A young worker wrote in a letter: I guarantee to Mother that I will overfulfill the state plan and then overfulfill it again. A government staff member wrote in a letter: After listening to Mother's report, I deeply realized that the draft Constitution is indeed the flower bloomed and the fruit borne by the blood of the martyrs.

    施妈妈的报告会
    新华社记者　叶世涛
    七月里的一天晚上，中国人民银行上海分行的大礼堂里坐满了人，他们是来听施妈妈的宪法草案报告的。
    大会开始了，千百双眼睛凝视着出现在讲台上的施小妹——一个六十五岁的老年工人，她两鬓微白，眼睛闪闪发光。这位老战士，二十七年以前就参加了革命斗争。“五卅”运动时，她参加了上海工人英勇斗争的行列，后来又参加了第一次国内革命战争时期上海工人三次武装起义。施妈妈在台上安祥地开始了她的报告。她描述了当年在共产党的领导下，一次又一次冒着危险搬运武器渡过黄浦江的情景。她沉痛地回忆到一九二七年“四一二”事变，蒋介石背叛革命后那些动荡的岁月里，上海笼罩在“杀风”、“捕风”的白色恐怖中。她说：蒋匪帮几次来捉我，迫得我成为无家可归的人。丈夫给反动派捉去，大儿子为革命英勇就义了，两个小儿子也因无人照顾而死了。讲到这里，她激动地说：我没有哭，我的儿子为国家牺牲是光荣的。我忍住痛苦，改姓换名，坚持斗争了二十年。今天，斗争终于胜利了，革命先烈的血没有白流，用生命换来的民主、自由、平等的权利在宪法草案里规定下来了……。接着，施妈妈又指着自己眼睛上的疤痕，向大家叙述她自己在反动派统治时代做工时所受到的资本家的虐待和迫害。她说：过去资本家说我们工人是“下贱货”，说什么“黄浦江里的水混浊、做工的人龃龉”；而现在劳动成为光荣的事情，劳动者到处受到尊敬，宪法草案里不是明明白白地写着的吗！？她鼓励大家要用自己两只手把紧橹，加紧划，好迅速地安稳地过渡到社会主义社会。她诙谐地而又满怀信心地说：“去年国家已开始了五年计划建设。我不愿躺在卧车里睡到社会主义社会，我还要在火车头上跟你们比赛比赛哩！”
    从中华人民共和国宪法草案公布那天到七月十七日，施妈妈已经作过三十七次报告了。听过她报告的工人、机关干部、学生、解放军战士、里弄妇女就有三万五千多人。现在，预约她去作报告的日期已经排到七月底。不管闷热的下午还是雷雨的晚上，施妈妈总是不辞辛苦地赶去报告，有时一天得赶两三个大会，喉咙讲得都有点哑了。她曾对人说：看到宪法草案，就好像看到我们艰苦奋斗的历史一样，脑子里自然地想到许多事情，我要告诉大家，宪法草案的一字一句都是用烈士鲜血写成的，让大家晓得宪法草案得来不易，让大家认真讨论宪法草案。施妈妈学会写字还是最近几年来的事，现在她已能够用淳朴的话语来准备讲稿，宪法草案中的有些条文，她已能背诵出来了。她说，宪法草案写出了人民的愿望，不好好研究它，怎能称得起当家作主呢？
    许多工人、少年先锋队员、机关工作人员听了施妈妈的报告后，都给她来信。施妈妈常常戴起老花眼镜，微笑着阅读这些信件。一个青年工人来信说：我向妈妈保证超额完成再超额国家计划。一个机关工作人员的信上说：听了妈妈的报告，我才深深体会到宪法草案的确是烈士们的血开出的花，结下的果。
