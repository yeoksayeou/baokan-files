The peasants in the famous old revolutionary base area of western Fujian are enthusiastically participating in mutual aid and cooperative organizations. By the end of June, 63% of the peasants in the region had been organized, and 200 agricultural producers' cooperatives had been established on a trial basis. In several well-known revolutionary base villages—such as Houtian Village in Longyan County, which persisted in revolutionary struggle for more than 20 years, and Qiling Township in Yongding County, which was called "Iron-Willed Qiling" because it waged a tenacious and unyielding struggle against the enemy for a long time—more than 70% of the peasants are now organized. In Caixi Township, Shanghang County (including Shangcaixi and Xiacaixi townships), the model township of the central revolutionary base area during the Second Revolutionary Civil War, which was introduced in a special chapter in Chairman Mao's "Rural Survey," more than 80% of the peasants have now been organized for production. These old base areas all experimented with running one or several agricultural producers' cooperatives last year and this spring. Many old Red Army soldiers, old Red Guards, old guerrillas, and members of the Children's Corps during the Second Revolutionary Civil War have been elected as mutual aid team leaders and agricultural producers' cooperative chairmen throughout the region. The peasants say: These "old revolutionaries" have now become leaders on the road to socialism.

Western Fujian has many mountains and few plains, a shortage of labor, and the people's economic life was severely damaged by the enemy before liberation. Organizing production plays a significant role in further tapping the potential of farmland, developing local and special product production to increase farmers' income, and meeting national needs. This year, all 200 agricultural producers' cooperatives in the region have carried out basic farmland construction, such as improving soil and building water conservancy projects, which are difficult for individual farmers to do in mountainous areas. The grain production increase plans of each cooperative are generally about 10% higher than last year. While developing agricultural production, each cooperative is also developing the production of local and special products such as pine resin tapping, charcoal burning, forestry, and tea, based on local conditions and national needs.

    闽西老根据地农民积极组织起来发展生产
    我国著名的革命老根据地——闽西地区的农民踊跃参加互助合作组织。到六月底止，全区组织起来的农民达到百分之六十三，并试办了二百个农业生产合作社。几个著名的革命老根据地基点乡村——曾坚持二十多年革命斗争的龙岩县后田村、曾和敌人长期进行顽强不屈斗争因而被称为“铁打的岐岭”的永定县岐岭乡等，目前组织起来的农民已达到百分之七十以上。在毛主席写的“农村调查”中曾专章介绍过的第二次国内革命战争时期的中央革命老根据地模范乡——上杭县才溪乡（包括上才溪、下才溪两个乡），目前已有百分之八十以上农民组织起来生产。这几处老根据地在去年和今年春天都先后试办了一个或数个农业生产合作社。全区有不少红军老战士、老赤卫队员、老游击队员以及第二次国内革命战争时期的儿童团团员被选为互助组组长、农业生产合作社社长。农民说：这些“老革命”同志今天又成为社会主义的带路人。
    闽西地区山多平原少，劳动力缺乏，人民经济生活在解放前受到敌人严重摧残。组织起来生产对进一步挖掘农田潜在力量、发展土产特产生产来增加农民收入、满足国家需要都有很大作用。全区二百个农业生产合作社今年都进行了改良土壤、兴修水利等单干农民难于做到的山区农田的基本建设，各社的增产粮食计划一般都比去年提高一成左右。在发展农业生产的同时，各社又根据当地具体条件和国家需要，发展割松脂、烧木炭以及林业、茶叶等土产特产生产。（新华社）
