    Farmers in river areas of Hebei Province are actively draining waterlogged fields and rushing to plant late crops, while also preparing for flood prevention.
    In mid-to-late June this year, heavy rains fell in the upper reaches of various rivers in Hebei Province, causing rapid rises in the waters of the Hutuo River, Daqing River, Fuyang River, Yongding River, and Bei Canal. The water levels at Huangbizhuang on the Hutuo River, Beixukou on the Zhulong River, and Xingaifang on the Daqing River exceeded the guaranteed water levels. After the floods broke out, leadership at all levels quickly dispatched cadres to mobilize the masses to engage in flood control. The Shijiazhuang, Baoding, and Cangxian special districts successively sent many cadres to various counties to lead the work of rescuing and protecting dikes. The counties also dispatched a large number of cadres to mobilize the masses to go to the dikes to engage in rescue work. In Rao yang, Li County, Gao Yang and other seventeen counties alone, approximately two thousand five hundred cadres were dispatched. At the Beixukou flood diversion area of the Zhulong River, although the water level exceeded the guaranteed level, thanks to the active rescue efforts of cadres at all levels and the broad masses of farmers, the flood was finally overcome. The no-diversion strategy was maintained, protecting the crops in 240,000 mu of fields. At the Xingaifang flood diversion outlet of the Daqing River, the flood diversion water level was reached on June 24th. Because the wheat in the diversion channel had not yet been harvested, the Baoding Special District Flood Control Headquarters immediately requested and obtained approval from the Provincial Flood Control Headquarters to raise the guaranteed water level, protecting the entire harvest of 100,000 mu of wheat.
    Due to river overflow and continuous rain, some land in low-lying areas of the province suffered varying degrees of flooding. Leadership at all levels actively led farmers to drain water and rush to plant late crops. According to very incomplete statistics from the Baoding, Tianjin, and Shijiazhuang special districts, over one thousand cadres were involved in this work. As of July 5th, over 1.6 million mu of waterlogged land had been drained and late crops had been rushed to planting.
    Currently, all areas are strengthening flood control preparations. Recently, they have universally improved the flood control organization, material preparation, flood reporting equipment, dike inspection, and other tasks.

    河北省沿河农民积极排除积水抢种晚田
    河北省沿河各地农民积极排除积水，抢种晚田，赶作防汛准备。
    今年六月中、下旬，河北省各河上游普遍降落大雨，滹沱河、大清河、滏阳河、永定河、北运河等河水势猛涨，滹沱河的黄壁庄、潴龙河的北绪口、大清河的新盖房，都超过了保证水位。洪水暴发以后，各级领导机关都迅速抽调干部发动群众投入了防汛战斗。石家庄、保定、沧县等专区，先后派出干部多人，分别到各县领导抢险护堤。各县也抽调了大批干部，发动群众上堤抢险。仅饶阳、蠡县、高阳等十七个县，就抽调干部两千五百人左右。潴龙河北绪口分洪处，虽然超过保证水位，但在各级干部和广大农民的积极抢护下，终于战胜了洪水，坚持了不分洪，保住了二十四万亩地的田苗。大清河新盖房分洪口门，六月二十四日就达到了分洪水位，因为分洪道内的麦田还没有收割完，保定专区防汛指挥部就立即请示省防汛指挥部批准，提高了保证水位，保住了十万亩小麦的全部收成。
    由于河水漫溢和阴雨连绵，该省低洼地区有一部分土地遭受程度不同的水灾。各级领导机关积极领导农民排水和抢种晚田，投入这一工作的干部，据保定、天津、石家庄专区极不完整的统计，就有一千多人。到七月五日，各地已排出积水一百六十多万亩，抢种了晚田。
    目前各地正加强防汛准备。最近普遍把防汛组织、物料准备、报汛设备、堤防检查等工作做好。
