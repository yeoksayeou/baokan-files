Another Major Victory for Peaceful Negotiation

    The Geneva Conference, which the people of the world are closely concerned about, has closed, and the negotiations on the issue of the cessation of hostilities and restoration of peace in Indochina were concluded on July 21. The significant efforts made by peace-loving people and countries around the world to strive for peace have produced effective results. Following the Korean armistice, another serious war—the eight-year Indochina War—has come to an end; the peaceful aspirations of peace-loving people all over the world, the people of Indochina, and the people of France have begun to be realized. This significant victory helps to promote collective peace and security in Asia and helps to further ease international tensions. The people of the world are jubilant about this achievement of great historical significance.
    The agreement on the Indochina issue is a major achievement of the Geneva Conference. This is another major victory for the principles of peaceful negotiation and peaceful coexistence. It eloquently proves that, in the current international situation, any international dispute must and can be resolved through peaceful negotiation; as long as the parties concerned negotiate in good faith, even very sharp and complex disputes can be reconciled. The Geneva Conference has shown the world that the path of resolving international disputes by force is unworkable, and the era of resolving international disputes through negotiation has definitely arrived. As Comrade Zhou Enlai, Premier and Minister of Foreign Affairs of our country, pointed out in his speech at the Geneva Conference on July 21: "The ceasefire in Indochina once again proves that the power of peace is unstoppable. More and more countries in the world support peaceful coexistence. Any policy of strength that creates division and organizes opposing military blocs is unpopular. What the people of Asia want is not division and opposition, but peace and cooperation."
    The Geneva Conference's agreement on Indochina was reached on the basis of respecting the national rights of the people of Indochina to peace, independence, democracy, and unification. According to the principles stipulated in the agreement, France respects the independence, sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity of the three Indochinese states; the three Indochinese states will hold free national elections within their respective specified periods to achieve democracy and unification in each country. The goal of the Indochinese people's years of struggle has been to strive for national independence and freedom and to achieve democratic unification and lasting peace in the country. In order to achieve this lofty goal, the people of Indochina waged a heroic struggle that was admired by the world. Their struggle was just and received the sympathy and support of progressive humanity all over the world, thus continuously strengthening their own strength and achieving brilliant victories in the eight-year national liberation war. President Ho Chi Minh of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has proposed more than once the willingness to negotiate with France to stop hostilities. The Lao and Cambodian resistance governments and people have also expressed the same willingness. Although the peaceful demands of the Indochinese people have been repeatedly unreasonably rejected, and although some people have fantasized about using force to suppress the Indochinese people's movement for national liberation, a nation that has stood up and is determined to strive for independence, freedom, and peace is invincible. When the people of the world take on the cause of peace, the power of peace is invincible. The convening of the Geneva Conference and the achievement of an agreement on Indochina are clear evidence that the power of peace is irresistible.
    In the process of discussing the Indochina issue at the Geneva Conference, the desire of the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the delegation of France to reach an agreement, as well as their spirit of reconciliation, was the main basis for reaching an agreement. At the same time, the active assistance of the delegations of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the United Kingdom played a significant role in reaching the agreement. The eight specific proposals put forward by the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam at the beginning regarding the restoration of peace in Indochina, as well as the subsequent proposals made to narrow differences, were fully supported by the Chinese and Soviet delegations, which provided a practical basis for the peaceful resolution of the Indochina issue. The conference's agreements on the cessation of hostilities in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, on international supervision of the armistice and its members, and on the delimitation of regroupment areas, were all the result of the efforts of the Vietnamese, Chinese, and Soviet delegations to narrow the differences between the parties at the conference. The delegation of the French war faction Laniel-Bidault government violated the will of the French people and followed the United States in seeking a policy of continuing to expand the war, and as a result, was finally abandoned by the people. The efforts of the new French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Mendès France to seek a ceasefire in Indochina have won praise both at home and abroad.
      The delegation of the People's Republic of China, in line with our government's consistent peaceful foreign policy, worked from beginning to end at the Geneva Conference to promote an agreement, embodying the firm will of the 600 million Chinese people to strive for peace in Asia and the world. For the first time, the People's Republic of China, as one of the world's major powers, consulted with major powers on major international issues and made its own contributions, winning praise from widespread world public opinion. The international status of the People's Republic of China as one of the world's major powers has been universally recognized, and its international prestige has been greatly enhanced. The Chinese people feel extremely excited and honored by the efforts and achievements of our delegation.
      The restoration of peace in Indochina has made the prospects for collective peace in Asia and the world even brighter. The recent joint statements by the Prime Ministers of China and India and the Prime Ministers of China and Burma have all unanimously expressed the hope that the Geneva Conference can seek to restore peace in Indochina, and believe that the Five Principles of mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence should not only apply to relations between China and India, and between China and Burma, but also to general international relations. President Ho Chi Minh of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement supporting these two joint statements, and many other countries in Asia and around the world also expressed warm welcome and support. Public opinion in various countries generally believes that if the above-mentioned principles are accepted and acted upon in accordance with these principles, countries with different social systems and political systems in Asia and the world can coexist peacefully, any international disputes can be resolved through consultation, and world peace will be guaranteed. It is clear that the agreement on the Indochina issue reached at the Geneva Conference will greatly promote collective peace in Asia, promote the development of relations between Asian countries, thereby further easing the world situation, eliminating the danger of war, and promoting world peace.
    The achievement of the agreement on restoring peace in Indochina is another shameful defeat for the United States' policy of strength. Since the realization of the Korean armistice, in order to prevent further easing of international tensions, the United States ruling group has tried to directly interfere in and expand the Indochina War and conduct new military adventures in Asia. For this ulterior motive, the United States delegation at the Geneva Conference not only failed to put forward any constructive proposals, but instead stubbornly opposed the reasonable proposals of others, doing its utmost to widen differences and create obstacles, in an attempt to sabotage the Geneva Conference and block the path of international consultation, so that it could freely step up its war policy. U.S. Secretary of State Dulles spared no effort in planning a "joint action" to expand the Indochina War, using all means of threat and blackmail in an attempt to force Britain, France, and other countries to put together a Southeast Asian aggression group, thereby suppressing the national liberation movement in Asia, excluding the influence of Britain and France in Southeast Asia, in order to step up the implementation of its evil plan to establish a new colonial empire. Even when the conference finally entered a decisive stage, the United States still boycotted the conference, refusing to send foreign minister-level personnel to the conference, and Dulles also went to Paris to carry out obstruction activities. However, all the conspiracies and tricks of the United States ruling group could not stop the victory of peaceful negotiation, and the Geneva Conference overcame the multiple obstacles and sabotage of the United States and reached a glorious agreement. The agreement stipulates that the three Indochinese states will not participate in any military alliances and will not allow any foreign countries to establish military bases on their territory, which is another major blow to the United States' plan to put together a Southeast Asian aggression group. The United States ruling group's stubborn implementation of its policy of hostility to peace has placed it in an unprecedentedly isolated position internationally.
    The realization of the Indochina ceasefire is only the first step in the peaceful resolution of the Indochina issue. In order to consolidate peace in Indochina and thereby lead to the strengthening of peace in Asia, the countries concerned must guarantee the implementation of the agreement, realize democracy and unification in the Indochinese states, and prevent any conspiracies to undermine peace in Indochina.
    The agreement on the Indochina issue reached at the Geneva Conference will surely be supported by countries around the world, especially Asian countries and all peace-loving people. Our government and people fully agree with and support these agreements, and will, with full confidence, work with peace-loving people and countries around the world to strive for the thorough implementation of these agreements, and continue to work to oppose the policy of strength of the American imperialists and to maintain and consolidate world peace. We firmly believe that the people of all countries in the world will also have more courage and confidence, unite, make persistent efforts, and strive to oppose the danger of war and strive for peace. Peace will surely triumph over war!

### 和平协商的又一重大胜利

    和平协商的又一重大胜利
    全世界人民密切关心的日内瓦会议业已闭幕，关于印度支那停战和恢复和平的问题的谈判，已于七月二十一日达成了协议。世界爱好和平的人民和国家为争取和平而进行的重大努力，产生了有效的结果。继朝鲜停战以后，另一场严重的战争——历时八年的印度支那战争宣告结束了；全世界爱好和平的人民、印度支那人民和法国人民的和平愿望开始实现了。这个重大胜利，有助于促进亚洲的集体和平与安全，有助于进一步缓和国际紧张局势。世界人民对于这一具有重大历史意义的成就感到欢欣鼓舞。
    印度支那问题协议的达成，是日内瓦会议的重大收获。这是和平协商与和平共处的原则的又一重大胜利。它雄辩地证明了，在目前国际形势下，任何国际争端都必须而且可以用和平协商的方式加以解决；只要有关方面真诚地进行协商，那么，即便是非常尖锐而复杂的争端，也是能够取得和解的。日内瓦会议向全世界表明，用武力解决国际争端的道路是行不通的，用协商方式解决国际争端的时代已经肯定地到来了。正如我国总理兼外交部部长周恩来同志在七月二十一日的日内瓦会议上的发言所指出的：“印度支那的停战再一次证明了和平的力量是阻挡不住的。世界上赞成和平共处的国家越来越多。任何制造分裂、组织对立的军事集团的实力政策，是不得人心的。亚洲人民所要求的决不是分裂和对立，而是和平和合作”。
    日内瓦会议关于印度支那的协议，是在尊重印度支那人民的和平、独立、民主、统一的民族权利的基础上达成的。根据协议所规定的原则，法国尊重印度支那三国的独立、主权、统一和领土完整；印度支那三国将在各自规定的期限内举行全国的自由选举以实现各该国的民主和统一。印度支那人民多年奋斗的目标，就是为了争取民族的独立和自由，实现国家的民主统一和持久和平。印度支那人民为了实现这个崇高的目标，进行了举世钦敬的英勇斗争。他们所进行的斗争是正义的，取得了全世界进步人类的同情和支持，因而在八年的民族解放战争中不断地壮大了自己的力量，并取得了辉煌的胜利。越南民主共和国胡志明主席曾不止一次地提出愿与法国谈判停止敌对行动的建议。寮国和高棉抗战政府和人民也曾表示了同样的意愿。尽管印度支那人民的和平主张一再遭到无理拒绝，尽管有人幻想用武力来镇压印度支那人民争取民族解放的运动，但是，已经站起来了的决心争取独立自由与和平的民族是不可战胜的。当世界人民把和平的事业担当起来，和平力量就是不可战胜的。日内瓦会议的召开并取得了关于印度支那的协议，就是和平力量不可抗拒的明证。
    在日内瓦会议讨论印度支那问题的过程中，越南民主共和国代表团和法国代表团要求达成协议的愿望以及他们的和解精神，是达成协议的主要基础。同时，苏联、中华人民共和国和英国三国代表团的积极协助，对于达成协议起了重大的作用。越南民主共和国代表团一开始就提出的关于恢复印度支那和平的八点具体建议，以及后来为求缩小分歧而提出的建议，得到中、苏代表团的全力支持，这就为和平解决印度支那问题提供了切实的基础。会议关于在越南、柬埔寨和老挝停止敌对行动的协定，关于停战的国际监察及其成员问题和划定重新集结地区的界线问题的协议及最后宣言，都是经过了越、中、苏代表团努力缩小会议各方的分歧的结果。法国主战派拉尼埃—皮杜尔政府的代表团曾违背法国人民的意志，追随美国寻求继续扩大战争的政策，结果终于为人民所唾弃。法国新任总理兼外长孟戴斯—弗朗斯为谋求印度支那停战而进行的努力，则博得了法国内外的好评。
      中华人民共和国代表团本着我国政府一贯的和平外交政策，在日内瓦会议中自始至终努力促成协议，体现了六万万中国人民争取亚洲及世界和平的坚强意志。中华人民共和国第一次以世界大国之一的身份，与各大国一起协商重大国际问题，并作出了自己的贡献，取得了世界广泛舆论的赞扬。中华人民共和国作为世界大国之一的国际地位已为举世所公认，它的国际威望已大大提高。中国人民对我国代表团的努力和成就，感到极大的兴奋和光荣。
      印度支那和平的恢复，使亚洲及世界集体和平的前景更加光明了。最近中印两国总理和中缅两国总理的联合声明，都曾一致表示希望日内瓦会议能够谋求恢复印度支那的和平，并认为互相尊重领土主权、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利及和平共处的五项原则，应不仅适用于中印、中缅之间的关系，而且适用于一般国际关系。越南民主共和国胡志明主席发表谈话，支持这两个联合声明，亚洲的其他许多国家及世界各国也表示热烈欢迎和支持。各国舆论普遍认为如果接受上述各项原则并按照这些原则办事，亚洲和世界不同社会制度和政治制度的国家就能够和平共处，任何国际争端都可以协商解决，世界和平就会有了保障。很显然，日内瓦会议关于印度支那问题取得的协议，将大大促进亚洲的集体和平，促进亚洲各国关系的发展，从而更进一步和缓世界局势消灭战争危险，促进世界和平。
    恢复印度支那和平的协议的达成，使美国实力政策又一次遭到可耻的挫败。自从朝鲜停战实现以后，美国统治集团为了要阻止国际紧张局势的进一步缓和，力图直接干涉并扩大印度支那战争，在亚洲进行新的军事冒险。为了这个不可告人的目的，美国代表团在日内瓦会议上不独没有提出任何一个建设性的建议，反而一味反对别人的合理建议，竭力扩大分歧，制造障碍，以图破坏日内瓦会议，堵死国际协商的道路，以便它放手加紧推行战争政策。美国国务卿杜勒斯不遗余力地策划扩大印度支那战争的“联合行动”，用尽威胁与讹诈的手段，企图迫使英、法等国拼凑东南亚侵略集团，借此镇压亚洲的民族解放运动，排斥英、法在东南亚的势力，以加紧推行它建立新殖民帝国的罪恶计划。甚至在会议最后进入决定性阶段的时候，美国还曾对会议进行抵制，拒绝遣派外长级的人员参加会议，杜勒斯还曾到巴黎进行阻挠活动。但是，美国统治集团的一切阴谋诡计都阻挡不住和平协商的胜利，日内瓦会议克服了美国的重重阻挠和破坏而达成了光荣的协议。协议规定印度支那三国将不参加任何军事同盟，并不容许任何外国在它们的领土上建立军事基地，这对于美国拼凑东南亚侵略集团的计划又是一个重大的打击。美国统治集团顽固地实行它的敌视和平的政策，已经使它在国际上陷于空前孤立的地位了。
    印度支那停战的实现只是和平解决印度支那问题的第一步。为了巩固印度支那的和平，并从而导致亚洲和平的加强，有关各国必须保证协议的实施，实现印度支那各国的民主和统一，防止任何破坏印度支那和平的阴谋。
    日内瓦会议所达成的关于印度支那问题的协议必将获得世界各国、特别是亚洲各国和一切爱好和平的人民的支持。我国政府和人民完全同意和支持这些协议，并将信心百倍地与全世界爱好和平的人民和国家一起争取这些协议的彻底实现，继续为反对美国帝国主义者的实力政策，为维护和巩固世界和平而努力。我们完全相信，世界各国人民，也会更加有勇气有信心，团结起来，再接再厉，为反对战争危险，争取和平而奋斗。和平必将战胜战争！
