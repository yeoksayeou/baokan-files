Reader's Letters Abstract:

    Editor's Note: Reader Ji Shengyan's letter criticizes the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant for not valuing the work of promoting advanced experience. After we entrusted a Shenyang Daily reporter to investigate, the situation proved to be true. Organizing the promotion of advanced production experience is also an important part of carrying out the technical innovation movement. This situation at the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant is bound to affect the development of the technical innovation movement and the improvement of production. The reader's letter and the Shenyang Daily reporter's investigation report are published together. It is hoped that the Second Machine Industry Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building will urge the plant to quickly change this situation.
    Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant Should Emphasize the Promotion of Advanced Production Experience
    Reader Ji Shengyan's letter

    Reader Ji Shengyan's letter: The leading cadres of Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant do not pay attention to the promotion of advanced production experience. Last November, Wang Xuegen, a planer in the second workshop of the plant, took the initiative to experiment with using a magical planer tool on a Soviet-style ten-meter gantry planer. With the help of technicians, he overcame many technical and tool-related difficulties and finally succeeded in the experiment in mid-December, increasing the efficiency of planing large bed frames by more than two times. The workers were very interested in this advanced experience, but they did not have tool holders and could not learn. Wang Xuegen went around trying to find a solution, but to no avail. Leading cadres such as the secretary of the plant's Party Committee and the vice-chairman of the trade union in charge of production knew about the successful experiment with the magical planer tool, but did not help solve the difficulties in promotion. As a result, this advanced experience had no follow-up after the successful experiment.
    Recently, Shenyang mechanical workers are learning Unanov's universal turning tool method. Ma Minghe, the foreman of the third workshop of the First Machine Tool Plant and a municipal model worker, and technicians helped the turner Zhang Yuxing to use Unanov's universal turning tool method to turn heavy lathe spindles, increasing work efficiency five times. Young turner Ma Xueli also greatly improved work efficiency by learning to use the Unanov universal turning tool and Voronov turning tool. All the workers in the plant are eager to learn, and the person in charge of the workshop also strongly supports it, but the Unanov universal turning tool method still remains on one or two lathes and cannot be promoted. Why is this happening? On the one hand, the plant department has not been responsible for solving the tool problem; on the other hand, there are no technicians to help workers solve technical difficulties.
    The administrative department and the trade union's rationalization proposal committee do not care about these issues. All they care about is issuing awards according to the rationalization proposal report form, and they are indifferent to helping the realization and promotion of rationalization proposals and advanced experience. Therefore, the situation of "returning tricks" (not using them after receiving the award) and "thousands of tricks, but there are difficulties in completing tasks" is very common in the factory.
    Investigation Report by Shenyang Daily Reporter
    The reader Ji Shengyan's letter reflects that the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant does not pay attention to the promotion of advanced production experience, which is confirmed by the investigation. In early 1952, the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant organized an advanced experience promotion team, and achieved certain results in promoting high-speed cutting. However, at the end of 1952, this organization was abolished, and no one was specifically in charge of the promotion of advanced experience and rationalization proposals. Therefore, the information on rationalization proposals and advanced experience proposed by the workers has been sleeping in the drawers of relevant cadres and traveling between various departments for a long time, and cannot be promoted and realized. This seriously affects the enthusiasm and creativity of the workers. Taking the third workshop as an example: in March, workers put forward more than 50 rationalization proposals; in May, only 5 were put forward; and in the first half of June, there was not even one.
    According to the investigation, the reason why advanced experience cannot be promoted in a timely manner is mainly due to the lack of a sound organizational structure. After the plant abolished the advanced experience promotion team, the leadership arranged for the directors of each workshop to be responsible for the promotion of advanced experience and the registration of rationalization proposals; however, the workshop directors were busy with their work and had many administrative meetings, completely ignoring this work, which was equivalent to no one being in charge. The workers once spontaneously organized themselves to learn from the Soviet Union's advanced experience and put on performances, but due to the lack of organizational leadership and support, the advanced experience could not be fully promoted, and the workers' enthusiasm gradually declined. Although the trade union has a rationalization proposal committee, it cannot play a role in supporting workers' rationalization proposals due to the unsound organization and other reasons.
    Secondly, insufficient technical strength is also an important reason. Since the plant organized the advanced experience promotion team in 1952, it has not systematically cultivated technical reserve forces; after the original personnel of the promotion team were transferred, it felt a lack of technical strength. The leading cadres of the plant believe that even if there is a sound organization, it will not solve the technical problems, so they have not actively tried to improve the organization; but at the same time, they have not studied how to cultivate new technical reserve forces.
    Due to the failure to promote advanced experience, production has also been affected to a certain extent.

### 沈阳第一机床厂应该重视推广先进的生产经验

专栏：读者来信摘要

    编者按：读者纪盛言来信批评沈阳第一机床厂不重视推广先进经验的工作。经我们委托沈阳日报记者调查，证明情况属实。组织先进生产经验的推广，也是开展技术革新运动的重要内容。沈阳第一机床厂的这种情况，势必影响了技术革新运动的开展，影响了生产的提高。现将读者来信和沈阳日报记者的调查报告一并发表。希望第一机械工业部第二机器工业管理局督促该厂迅速改变这种情况。
    沈阳第一机床厂应该重视推广先进的生产经验
    读者纪盛言来信
    读者纪盛言来信：沈阳第一机床厂领导干部不重视推广先进生产经验的工作。去年十一月，该厂第二车间刨工王学根主动地在苏式十公尺龙门刨床上试验运用奇妙的刨刀。他在技术员帮助下，克服了技术上、刀具上的许多困难，终于在十二月中旬试验成功，刨大床身效率提高两倍多。工人们对这个先进经验都很感兴趣，但是没有刀杆，没法学习。王学根到处奔走设法，也没有效果。该厂党委会的秘书和工会专管生产的副主席等领导干部都知道奇妙刨刀试验成功的情况，却没有帮助解决推广中的困难。于是，这个先进经验试验成功以后也就没有下文了。
    最近沈阳市机械工人正在学习乌纳诺夫万能车刀法，第一机床厂第三车间工长、市劳动模范马鸣贺和技术人员们帮助车工张玉兴运用乌纳诺夫万能车刀法，车重型车床主轴提高了工作效率五倍。青年车工马学礼学习运用乌纳诺夫万能车刀和渥罗诺夫车刀，也大大提高了工作效率。全厂工人都争着学习，车间的负责人也大力支持，但是乌纳诺夫万能车刀法仍然停留在一两台车床上不能推广。为什么会这样呢？一方面是厂部没有负责解决刀具问题；另一方面是没有技术人员帮助工人解决技术上的困难。
    对于这些问题，行政方面和工会合理化建议委员会都不管。他们管的只是照着合理化建议报告表发奖，对帮助合理化建议和先进经验的实现和推广都漠不关心。因此，窍门回头（领奖后不使用）和“窍门千千万，完成任务有困难”的情况在厂里很普遍。
    沈阳日报记者的调查报告
    读者纪盛言来信反映沈阳第一机床厂不重视推广先进生产经验的情况，据调查是确实的。沈阳第一机床厂在一九五二年初曾组织了先进经验推广队，在推广高速切削的工作中有了一定的成绩。但是到一九五二年末，这个组织被撤销了，推广先进经验和合理化建议的工作就没有专人管理。因此，工人提出的合理化建议和推广先进经验的资料就长期睡在有关干部的抽屉里和旅行在各部门之间，不能得到推广和实现。这就严重地影响了工人群众的积极性和创造性。以第三车间一个车间为例：在三月份工人提出合理化建议五十件以上；五月份仅提五件；六月上半月一件也没有。
    据调查，先进经验不能及时推广的原因，主要是没有健全的组织机构。该厂撤销先进经验推广队以后，领导方面虽布置要各车间主任负责推广先进经验工作和合理化建议登记工作；但车间主任工作繁忙，再加行政会议多，完全忽视了这项工作，等于没人负责管理一样。工人们曾自发地组织起来学习苏联先进经验并进行表演，因为缺乏组织领导和支持，先进经验不能全面推广，工人们的热情也逐渐低落。工会虽然有合理化建议委员会的组织，但是因为组织不健全等原因，也不能起到支持工人合理化建议的作用。
    其次，技术力量不足也是一个重要原因。该厂自一九五二年组织先进经验推广队后，并没有有计划地培养技术上的后备力量；原来推广队的人员调走后，就感到缺乏技术力量。该厂领导干部认为即使有健全的组织也解决不了技术上的问题，因而没有积极设法来健全组织；但同时，又没有研究如何培养新的技术后备力量。
    由于先进经验不能推广，生产也受到了一定影响。
