Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 6th: The twenty-seventh issue of "New Era" magazine published an editorial entitled "The United States is Undermining the Foundations of the United Nations." The editorial stated: "The events that occurred in the United Nations in June represent a new and serious test for this organization. The process and outcome of the Security Council's discussion of the so-called appeal from Thailand and later the discussion of Guatemala's accusation of armed aggression both prove that the United Nations failed this test. Because the United States is carrying out a conspiracy to undermine the United Nations, the Security Council has not truly fulfilled its responsibilities."

	The so-called appeal from Thailand is a brazen attempt by reactionary forces to use the prestige of the United Nations to expand the war in Indochina. In the Security Council, it is well known that the US State Department is the true planner of the "Thai appeal." The American ruling clique has obstructed the Security Council from fulfilling its basic responsibilities to Guatemala, which has been attacked. This resolution in the Security Council by the United States and its satellite delegations will be recorded in the history of the United Nations as one of the most shameful acts of those reactionary forces who are extremely hostile to the idea of collective security that constitutes the foundation of the United Nations.

	The magazine emphasized that the reason why Washington so rudely forces the United Nations to be unable to fulfill its direct obligation to maintain peace is now well known to everyone. Because the United States is the direct planner of the intervention in Guatemala and the coup in Guatemala. The reason why the United States wants to obstruct the Security Council from taking any concrete measures aimed at stopping the aggression against Guatemala is because it wants to buy time to expand its intervention and launch the activities of its "fifth column" in Guatemala, in order to make the suppression of the democratic forces of the Guatemalan people a fait accompli.

	The editorial stated that there is no doubt that the Security Council's position on the Guatemalan incident has brought serious damage to the prestige of the United Nations. As a result of repeated actions by the United States, the issue of aggression against Guatemala has been removed from the purview of the Security Council. This is yet another attempt by the United States to rudely undermine the UN Charter and, in effect, deprive the United Nations of its power to deal with affairs in the Western Hemisphere. If this conspiracy succeeds, then the United Nations will no longer be an international security organization for the whole world.

	"New Era" finally pointed out that the United States' constant attempts to use the United Nations as a guise to cover up its conspiracies against peace and general security in Asia are being severely condemned by all honest people around the world.

### “新时代”杂志评美国破坏联合国的基础

    “新时代”杂志评美国破坏联合国的基础
     【新华社六日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：第二十七期“新时代”杂志发表一篇社论，题为“美国正在破坏联合国的基础”。社论写道：六月份在联合国中所发生的事件是对这个组织的新的和严重的考验。安全理事会在讨论所谓泰国的呼吁以及后来讨论危地马拉对武装侵略的控诉的过程和结果，都证明联合国没有通过这个考验。由于美国执行着破坏联合国的阴谋诡计，安理会没有名符其实地履行自己的职责。
    所谓泰国的呼吁，是反动势力厚颜无耻地企图利用联合国的威信来扩大印度支那战争的一种手段。在安理会中尽人皆知美国国务院就是“泰国的呼吁”的真正筹划者。美国统治集团阻挠了安理会对遭到攻击的危地马拉履行自己的基本职责。美国和其各仆从国家代表团在安理会的这一项决议，将作为那些反动势力的一件最可耻的行为记入联合国的历史中，这些反动势力对构成联合国基础的集体安全思想是极端仇视的。
    杂志着重指出，华盛顿所以要这样粗暴地迫使联合国不能执行它维护和平的直接义务的原因，目前每个人都知道得很清楚。因为对危地马拉进行干涉和在危地马拉发生兵变的直接策划者就是美国。美国所以要阻挠安理会采取任何旨在停止对危地马拉侵略的具体措施，是因为它想赢得时间来扩大干涉，并在危地马拉展开它的“第五纵队”的活动，以便使危地马拉人民的民主力量的被扑灭成为既成事实。
    社论写道，安理会在危地马拉事件上采取的立场给联合国威信带来严重损失，这是毫无疑问的。美国一再活动的结果，使对危地马拉侵略的问题从安理会的职权范围内取消了。这是美国又一次企图粗暴地破坏联合国宪章，实际上就是剥夺联合国在处理西半球事务中的权力。如果这一阴谋得逞的话，那末联合国就不再成为全世界的国际安全组织了。
      “新时代”最后指出，美国不停地企图假借联合国来掩饰它反对和平和亚洲普遍安全的阴谋诡计，美国的这种政策正受到全世界一切正直的人们的严厉指责。
