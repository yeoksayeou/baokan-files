Shandong Province will complete 183,000 mu of afforestation during this rainy season. Preparations for rainy season afforestation have now been basically completed, and afforestation work is about to begin.

During the preparation work, many places in the Linqi, Tai'an, Wendeng, and Jiaozhou Special Districts held specialized meetings to make specific arrangements. More than 30 key afforestation counties, such as Zichuan, Boshan, Xintai, and Yiyuan, have sent cadres to assist districts, townships, and well-established mutual aid and cooperation organizations in conducting forest land surveys, seedling allocation, and manpower organization. In order to successfully complete the rainy season afforestation plan, many counties have transferred cadres to establish bases in areas with well-established mutual aid and cooperation. According to statistics from the five special districts of Linqi, Tai'an, Jining, Wendeng, and Changwei, as well as the Zibo industrial and mining area and Qingdao City, the special districts and counties have dispatched a total of more than 300 cadres to grasp the bases.

The preparation of tree seedlings and tree seeds in various places has also been basically completed. The Linqi Special District has more than 70 million seedlings, including 13 million from state-owned nurseries and more than 57 million seedlings cultivated by the masses. The Tai'an Special District has properly allocated more than 6 million pine and cypress seedlings from state-owned nurseries that can be released in the rainy season, and has signed contracts with the afforestation masses. The Forestry Institute of Yishui County has also mobilized the masses to organize seedling promotion groups to vigorously promote the pine seedlings cultivated by the masses to meet the needs of the masses in areas lacking seedlings. Various places have also begun to transfer small-grained seeds for direct seeding afforestation. The Forestry Bureau of the Tai'an Prefectural Commissioner's Office has transported more than 37.3 million jin of oil pine seeds from the Taishan Forest Farm to Xintai, Laiwu, and Cuyang counties. Yiyuan County has also transported more than 2,000 jin of pine seeds to Boshan County and Zibo City.

Thanks to early planning and thorough preparation, Shandong Province's rainy season afforestation work this year is expected to be completed smoothly.

    山东省基本完成雨季造林准备工作
    山东省今年在雨季中将要完成十八万三千亩的造林任务，雨季造林的准备工作现已基本完成，造林工作即将展开。
    在准备工作中，临沂、泰安、文登、胶州等专区很多地方召开了专业会议具体布置。淄川、博山、新泰、沂源等三十多个造林重点县，都已派出干部深入协助各区乡及基础较好的互助合作组织，进行了林地勘查、种苗调配、人力组织等工作。为了胜利完成雨季造林计划，很多县都调配干部，深入互助合作基础较好地区，设立了基点。据临沂、泰安、济宁、文登、昌潍等五个专区及淄博工矿区、青岛市的统计，各专区、县派出掌握基点的干部共达三百余人。
    各地树苗树种的准备工作也已基本完成。临沂专区已掌握树苗七千多万株，其中公营苗圃一千三百万株，群众育苗五千七百多万株。泰安专区已将公营苗圃雨季能出圃的六百余万株松柏苗调配妥当，并与造林群众签定了合同。沂水县林业所更发动群众组织了苗木推广组，大力推广群众自育的松苗，以满足缺苗地区群众造林的需要。各地并已开始调运直播造林用的小粒种子，泰安专署林业局从泰山林场已运往新泰、莱芜、徂阳等县三千七百多万斤油松种，沂源县也运给了博山县、淄博市二千余斤松种。
    山东省今年雨季造林工作，由于着手较早、准备充分，预计将能顺利完成任务。
