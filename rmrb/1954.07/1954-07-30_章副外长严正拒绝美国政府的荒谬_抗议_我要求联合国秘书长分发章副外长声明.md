Xinhua News Agency, July 29th: British Chargé d'Affaires Mr. D.W. Jerram delivered to Vice Foreign Minister Zhang Hanfu on the 28th a so-called "protest" from the U.S. government. This protest, made after U.S. aircraft intruded into our country's airspace and shot down two of our aircraft, was intended to confuse and mislead the public by reversing black and white. Vice Foreign Minister Zhang Hanfu immediately and sternly rejected this absurd and ridiculous "protest" from the U.S. government.

Xinhua News Agency, July 29th: Yan Baohang, Acting Director of the General Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of our country, sent a telegram to UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld in New York on the 29th, attaching the full text of the statement made by Vice Foreign Minister Zhang Hanfu of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the U.S. government lodging the most serious protest against the U.S. Air Force's violation of our country's airspace and shooting down of our two patrol planes. He requested Hammarskjöld to distribute the full text of this statement to the delegations of all UN member states except for the so-called "delegation" of the Kuomintang remnant group.
