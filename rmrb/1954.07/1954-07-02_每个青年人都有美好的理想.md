    Every Young Person Has Beautiful Ideals
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter Shen Chengru
    One clear Thursday afternoon, groups of young people came to a lawn in Zhongshan Park, where they sat in a circle, intimately discussing "My Ideal." This was an interesting class meeting for the senior year of high school at Shanghai's Huxi Middle School. Soon, these students would be graduating, and everyone couldn't help but talk about their future.
    Youth League member Wu Zhishan was the first to speak. He said, "I made up my mind a year ago to become a geologist in the future." He remembered visiting his elderly grandmother in his hometown, where he heard the villagers tell him: there are minerals in the nearby mountains, but they haven't seen the government send people to develop them. At that time, he replied with a smile, "I will learn this skill in the future and discover all the mineral resources of the motherland." The news of Soviet youth bravely setting out to reclaim new lands gave him tremendous encouragement. He was determined to be like the Soviet youth, never seeking an easy life. Not only at school, but also at home after school, he paid attention to exercising his body, preparing to undertake arduous tasks in the future.
    The discussion quickly became heated. Jiang Zhenghua, who had a good foundation in mathematics, expressed his desire to study astronomy and explore the secrets of the universe in the future. Shen Yafang aspired to study water conservancy well and turn all the harmful rivers in our country into good rivers. Wang Xiande, nicknamed "Doctor," loved the "infinitely changing" chemistry; Zhou Zhongyi, who had always been interested in physics, was determined to study science. Gu Ping'er, who had served as chairman of the student union, and Wu Gengcheng and Wu Huifang, who had served as class presidents, all chose Chinese language and literature as their major. Wu Huifang said:
  "The construction of the motherland needs all kinds of experts, and we choose different majors according to our personal conditions." She loved literature when she was in junior high school and said she wanted to be a people's writer in the future. Gu Ping'er plans to devote himself to the fiery struggle in the future, live with workers, peasants, and soldiers, and be a person who loves life and walks at the forefront of life.
    Guo Weilin's aspiration aroused people's yearning for grassland life. This young man with sun-tanned skin chose veterinary medicine. He said that he had liked raising livestock since he was a child. At that time, regardless of day or night, rain or shine, he always ran to take care of them many times a day. His beautiful ideal is on the vast grassland. He said, "I will be so happy when prosperous pastures are established in the remote border areas of the motherland!"
    Time passed imperceptibly, and the students became more and more enthusiastic. "I want to be a people's teacher," said Wu Shouyi, the current secretary of the Youth League branch. He originally felt that the work of a teacher was very hard and not easy to do well. Recently, he and more than 30 students visited East China Normal University and had a deeper understanding of the responsibilities of a teacher's work. He said: As a people's teacher, his education objects are all the excellent descendants of the motherland. He is the first to see every bit of growth of the youth. The labor results of young people in the future also contain a share of the teacher's hard work.
    A chatty and laughter-filled forum took place happily for more than three hours. A sentence spoken by a classmate in his speech reflected the mood of these young people: "We are Michurin-style seeds, even if transplanted to Siberia, we will grow southern plants!"

### 每个青年人都有美好的理想

    每个青年人都有美好的理想
    新华社记者  沈澄如
    一个晴朗的星期四下午，一群年轻人三三两两地来到了中山公园的一块草地上，他们团团围坐在一起，亲密地谈论着“我的理想”。这是上海市沪西中学高中三年级一次有趣的班会。不久，这些学生就要毕业了，大家禁不住要谈起各人的未来。
    青年团员吴峙山第一个发言。他说：“我在一年以前就打定主意将来做一个地质工作者。”他记得有次回乡探望年老的外祖母，听到老乡们告诉他：附近山里有矿，但是没有看到政府派人前来开发。那时他笑着答道：“我将来就要学这一行本领，把祖国矿藏全部发掘出来。”苏联青年英勇出发开垦新地的消息，更给他莫大的鼓舞。他决心要像苏联青年一样，永不寻找轻松的生活。不仅在学校里，而且在放学后回到家中，他都注意锻炼身体，准备着担当将来繁重的任务。
    发言很快就热烈起来了。数学基础较好的蒋正华表示要学习天文，将来好探寻宇宙的秘密。沈雅芳立志要学好水利，把我国所有的害河变成好河。外号“博士”的王显德热爱着“变化无穷”的化学；素来对物理有兴趣的周忠益决心要读理科。曾经担任学生会主席的顾平尔和担任过班主席的吴根成、吴蕙芳都选择中国语言文学专业。吴蕙芳说：
  “祖国建设事业需要各种专家，我们根据个人条件，选择不同的专业。”她在初中读书时就爱好文学，表示将来要做一个人民作家。顾平尔准备将来投身到火热的斗争中去，和工人、农民、战士生活在一起，做一个热爱生活、走在生活最前面的人。
    郭维林的志愿激发着人们对于草原生活的向往的感情。这个被太阳晒得皮肤黧黑的小伙子选择了兽医。他说，他从小就喜欢喂养牲口，那时不管白天黑夜，天晴下雨，每天他总要好多次跑去照管它们。他的美丽的理想就在广阔的大草原里。他说：“在祖国遥远的边疆，建立起一个个牲畜旺盛的大牧场来，那时我将多么高兴！”
    时间不知不觉地溜过去了，同学们越谈越起劲。“我愿做一个人民教师。”现任青年团总支书记的吴守义说。他原来对教师工作只感到很艰苦，不容易干好。最近他和三十多个同学一起参观了华东师范大学，对于教师工作的职责才有了比较深切的体会。他说：作为一个人民教师，他的教育对象都是祖国优秀的后代。每个青年一点点的成长，只有他最先看到。在青年人将来的劳动成果中，也包含着教师的一分心血。
    一场有说有笑的座谈，愉快地进行了三个多小时。有个同学发言中讲的一句话反映出这些青年人的心境：“我们是米丘林式的种子，即使移植到西伯利亚去，也将生长出南方的植物来！”
