The American ruling clique is gloating over their base aim of subverting the legitimate government of Guatemala, but they cannot escape the severe condemnation of world opinion for what they have done, nor can they make up for another serious bankruptcy in politics and morality.

After strangling the democratic regime in Guatemala, the American ruling clique even deems it unnecessary to conceal that they themselves are the chief culprits of this crime. Thus, people have seen that after the American head of government formally expressed "satisfaction" and "gratification" for their crimes, American officials and propaganda machines continued to boast endlessly of America's "victory" and "success." It is enough to cite the tune of the "New York Daily News," which said bluntly: It is becoming "more and more obvious that American Ambassador Peurifoy played a huge role in overthrowing the pro-communist government of Arbenz. For this, we believe Peurifoy should receive the warm applause of his American compatriots…." Another newspaper believed that "credit" should be given to the infamous espionage leader Allen Dulles. Who exactly among the American ruling clique was the one who directly wielded the knife against the legitimate government of Guatemala is unimportant. The most important thing is that all honest people around the world have seen how brutal and shameless the American ruling clique is as colonialists.

The American ruling clique has always disguised themselves as the maintainers of national independence of various countries in order to cover up their colonialist faces. However, this cannot deceive people. This time, America's armed intervention and subversion activities in Guatemala have completely exposed the masks of these hypocrites.

Mrs. Poblete, the Chilean representative, gave the following definition of national independence at the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference:

"The national liberation understood by the people is the recognition of their right to choose their own way of life and form of government; to decide for themselves how to develop, use, and exchange their natural resources; and to live under the principle that various forms of government can coexist peacefully on the basis of equality and mutual respect." The Atlantic Charter, which the American ruling clique still flaunts today, also recognizes "respect for the right of all peoples to choose the form of government under which they will live." However, any solemn international agreement or declaration can be trampled on and despised at any time in the eyes of the American ruling clique. The American ruling clique cannot allow Latin American countries to have any such rights. The Arbenz government of Guatemala, which was regarded as a thorn in the side by the United States, had taken some measures to safeguard national interests, but at that time, Guatemala's main resources and economic lifeline were still in the hands of American monopoly capital. The United Fruit Company and the Central American International Railway Company still held great economic privileges and power in Guatemala, controlling its production, transportation, ports, and trade. Despite this, the American ruling clique still could not tolerate it, and was determined to turn Guatemala back into a colony that they could arbitrarily control in order to be satisfied. Since 1944, the United States has instigated dozens of armed rebellions in Guatemala, and American diplomatic officials have constantly threatened the Guatemalan government, repeatedly clamoring to change Guatemala's democratic political system. Finally, it even instigated armed aggression and a coup d'état, subverting the legitimate Arbenz government. All of this is enough to show how the American ruling clique despises a country's independent sovereignty and the rights of the people.

America's interventionist atrocities in Guatemala have also exposed how hypocritical and clumsy the so-called "communist threat" that American aggressors have always clamored about is. Everyone knows that the Guatemalan government led by Arbenz was a bourgeois democratic government. The Guatemalan Labor Party only had four seats in the parliament and did not participate in the government. The Guatemalan Labor Party, like the working-class parties in other countries, loyally adheres to the policy of safeguarding national interests and opposing foreign aggression. It is precisely because of this that it supports the Arbenz government's program. Merle G. Inman, a fierce anti-communist and conservative expert on Latin American issues, also pointed out: "...compared to the British Labour program and the American New Deal, the Guatemalan reforms can only be said to be a very faint pink."

The obvious fact is that, whether for Guatemala or for Latin America, just like any other country in the world, there is no so-called "communist threat" at all, let alone threatening the security of the United States and the Western Hemisphere. On the contrary, it is not others but the American ruling clique that has been imposing various threats (including armed blockades and creating dozens of coup plots) on the Guatemalan democratic government, and now has actually attacked Guatemala. Therefore, it is very clear that the real threat to Latin America and the world is not communism, but American colonialism.

Equally clear is the fact that when the United States clamors that some place is under "communist threat," it means that the United States is promoting colonialist expansion there. In recent years, the United States has used the same vicious banner, using 2.2 billion US dollars and 400,000 tons of military materials, to intervene in the Indochina War and tried every means to expand the war. Now, it wants to piece together a Southeast Asian aggressive bloc to suppress the national liberation movements of the Asian people and squeeze out the influence of Britain and France in Asia, also under this banner. Everyone with eyes can clearly see the aggressive conspiracy hidden behind the American ruling clique's anti-communist clamor.

At the same time, America's aggression against Guatemala has once again proved that it is the most tyrannical destroyer of the United Nations organization.

Although the United States has been唾骂 (tuò mà - reviled/cursed) by the people of the world for stealing the banner of the United Nations to carry out the aggressive war in Korea, the United States still shamelessly tries its best to portray itself as the most loyal supporter and defender of the United Nations organization. Recently, at the Geneva Conference, the American representatives were still talking about maintaining the "moral authority" of the United Nations as an excuse for disrupting the discussion of the Korean issue. Of course, this kind of rhetoric from the United States can only be ridiculed. But nothing has more thoroughly exposed that it does not take the United Nations seriously at all, but only regards the United Nations as a tool to promote its aggressive policies than what the United States has recently done in Guatemala.

America's acts of aggression and intervention against Guatemala are completely contrary to the United Nations Charter. Article 2, paragraph 4 of the Charter clearly stipulates:

"All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations." However, the American interventionists instigated armed invasion from abroad and instigated armed coups at home against Guatemala, flagrantly strangling its national sovereignty. Isn't this the most serious violation of the United Nations Charter? Not only that, when Guatemala filed a complaint and appeal to the United Nations Security Council for the open aggression it suffered, the American representatives arrogantly tried every means to prevent the Security Council from taking action to stop the aggression, insisting on handing over the issue of Guatemala to the Organization of American States, which is manipulated by the United States. The United States completely ignored the Security Council's resolution requiring a cessation of hostilities, and unreasonably prevented the Security Council from discussing the issue of Guatemala again. However, at the same time, people saw that the United States instructed Thailand to submit a so-called "appeal" to the United Nations Security Council on the pretext of the fabricated so-called "threat" to Thailand's security, requesting to send an "observation group" to Thailand to "observe," actually wanting to pave the way for the United States to create a second Korean War in the United Nations. After the "Thai appeal" supported by the United States and its followers was rejected by the Security Council, the United States was again conspiring to undermine the United Nations Charter, wanting to convene the United Nations General Assembly to use the majority voting machine to pass the "Thai appeal." As long as honest people can see from here how the United States is continuing to trample on the United Nations.

It is absolutely impossible for the United States to escape the judgment of world opinion for all its despicable and barbaric acts, because the conscience of mankind has not been corrupted, and there are still forces of justice and fairness in the world. Even those who do not sympathize with or support communism cannot help but condemn America's aggressive crimes. The Uruguayan House of Representatives in Latin America formally passed a resolution criticizing America's "aggression against Guatemala as a conspiracy to destroy peace in the Americas and an act of depriving free people of their right to self-determination." According to a Reuter dispatch from Reading, England, on July 4, Ian Mikardo, a British Labor Party member of parliament, severely criticized that "the ideological disguise of American imperialism is more cunning, shameless, and hypocritical than any disguise ever conceived by any British imperialist." He also condemned the United States for "seriously striking at the principles of the United Nations organization and international rules when it used cheap and shameless tricks to prevent the Security Council from dealing with the event of Guatemala being subjected to aggression." America's "New York Post" could not help but point out worriedly: America's aggressive actions against Guatemala have made

"The fear and hatred of the United States, which is already very common throughout Latin America (actually more than just Latin America), will only increase." Therefore, what the United States has gained from this aggressive action is actually complete moral bankruptcy and a further decline in international prestige. The naked exposure of the face of American colonialism in Guatemala is beneficial for a wide range of people to see through and oppose America's sinful policies.

    美国干涉者道义上的彻底破产
    谭文瑞
    美国统治集团正因他们达到了颠覆危地马拉的合法政府的卑鄙的目的而得意洋洋，但是他们无法逃避世界舆论对他们所作的严厉谴责，无法弥补他们在政治上和道义上又一次严重的破产。
    美国统治集团在绞杀了危地马拉民主政权以后，甚至认为无须乎掩饰他们自己是这一罪行的元凶。因此人们就看到了，在美国的政府首脑对他们的罪行正式表示“满意”和“欣慰”之后，美国的官员和宣传机器还继续喋喋不休地在夸耀美国的“胜利”和“成功”。只要举出“纽约每日新闻”的论调来就够了，它直言无隐地说：事情已“愈来愈明显，美国大使普里弗伊在推翻阿本斯的亲共政府的事件中是起了巨大的作用的。为此，我们认为普里弗伊是应该得到他的美国同胞热烈喝采的……。”另外一家报纸则认为应该归“功”臭名远扬的特务头子艾伦·杜勒斯。在美国统治集团中究竟谁是对危地马拉合法政府直接持刀行凶的人，这原是无关重要的，最重要的是全世界一切正直的人们都由此看到了美国统治集团是如何凶残无耻的殖民主义者。
    美国统治集团一向把他们自己装扮成各国民族独立的维护者，来掩饰他们的殖民主义者的面目。但是，这是欺骗不了人的。美国这一次对危地马拉的武装干涉和颠覆活动就彻底地揭破了这些伪善者的假面具。
    智利代表波布列特夫人在亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议上曾给民族独立下过这样一个定义，她说：
  “人民所了解的民族解放，是承认他们有权利选择他们自己的生活方式和政府的形式；由他们自己决定如何去开发、使用和交换他们的天然富源，以及各种形式政府可以在平等与互相尊重的基础上和平共存的原则下过日子。”美国统治集团现在仍然标榜的大西洋宪章，也承认“尊重各民族自由决定其赖以生存之政府形式之权利”。可是，任何庄严的国际协议或宣告，在美国统治集团看来，都是随时可以践踏和蔑视的。美国统治集团就不能容许拉丁美洲国家有任何一点点这样的权利。被美国视为眼中钉的危地马拉的阿本斯政府，曾经采取了一些维护民族利益的措施，但是那时危地马拉的主要的资源和经济命脉还是掌握在美国垄断资本的手中，联合果品公司和中美国际铁路公司在危地马拉仍然据有着极大的经济特权和势力，控制着它的生产、运输、港口和贸易。尽管这样，美国统治集团还是不能容许它，一心要使危地马拉再沦为他们可以任意支配的殖民地，才能满足。从一九四四年以来，美国在危地马拉就策动过几十次武装暴动，美国的外交官员不断对危地马拉政府进行威吓，一再叫嚷要变更危地马拉的民主政体。最后甚至策动武装侵略和政变，颠覆了合法的阿本斯政府。这一切便足以说明美国统治集团是如何蔑视一个国家的独立主权和人民的权利了。
    美国干涉危地马拉的暴行，也暴露了美国侵略者所一贯叫嚣的所谓“共产主义威胁”，是一种何等虚伪的拙劣伎俩。谁都知道，阿本斯所领导的危地马拉政府是资产阶级的民主政府，在议会中危地马拉劳动党只占有四个议席，并没有参加政府。危地马拉劳动党和其他国家的工人阶级政党一样，忠诚地奉行着维护民族利益和反对外国侵略的政策，正是因为这样，它支持阿本斯政府的纲领。激烈反共和保守的拉丁美洲问题专家穆尔·盖·因曼也曾指出：“……和英国的劳工纲领以及美国的新政比较起来，危地马拉的改革只能说是很浅淡的绯红色。”
    很明显的事实是，不论对于危地马拉来说也好，或者对于拉丁美洲来说也好，正和世界任何其他国家一样，根本没有受到所谓“共产主义的威胁”，更谈不到说威胁美国和西半球的安全。恰恰与此相反，不是别人而正是美国统治集团，一直以种种威胁（包括武装封锁和制造数十次的政变阴谋）加在危地马拉民主政府的身上，现在竟对危地马拉下了毒手。因此，很明显，对于拉丁美洲和世界各国的真正威胁不是共产主义，而是美国的殖民主义。
    同样清楚的事实是，当美国叫嚣什么地方受到“共产主义威胁”时，那就意味着美国是在那里推行殖民主义的扩张。近年来美国就是打着同样恶毒的幌子，用了二十二亿美元和四十万吨军事物资，插手到印度支那战争去，并千方百计地要扩大这场战争。现在，它要拼凑东南亚侵略集团，镇压亚洲人民的民族解放运动，排挤英法在亚洲的势力，也是打着这个幌子的。每一个有眼睛的人，都可以清楚地看到美国统治集团反共叫嚣背后所隐藏的侵略阴谋了。
    同时，美国对危地马拉的侵略，又一次证明了它是联合国组织的最横暴的破坏者。
    虽然美国由于盗窃联合国的旗帜进行侵略朝鲜的战争而受尽了世界人民的唾骂，但是美国仍然厚颜无耻地把自己极力说成是联合国组织最忠诚的拥护者和保卫者。最近在日内瓦会议上，美国代表还在高谈维护联合国的“道义权威”，来作为它破坏朝鲜问题的讨论的借口。当然美国的这种花言巧语只能招人耻笑。但是却没有比美国最近在危地马拉的所作所为更彻底暴露了它根本没有把联合国放在眼里，而只将联合国当作推行它侵略政策的工具。
    美国对危地马拉的侵略和干涉行为，是完全违反联合国宪章的。宪章第二条第四款就明白规定：
  “各会员国在其国际关系上不得使用威胁或武力，或以与联合国宗旨不符之任何其他方法，侵害任何会员国或国家之领土完整或政治独立。”而美国干涉者竟对危地马拉从国外策动武装侵犯，在国内策动武力政变，悍然扼杀它的民族主权。这难道还不是对联合国宪章最严重的破坏？不仅如此，当危地马拉为它所遭受的公开侵略而向联合国安全理事会提出控诉和呼吁的时候，美国代表竟专横地想尽办法阻挠安理会采取制止侵略的行动，坚持要把危地马拉的问题交给由美国操纵的美洲国家组织去处理。美国对于安理会所通过的要求停止敌对行动的决议根本置之不顾，并无理地阻止了安理会再讨论危地马拉的问题。可是，同时人们却看到美国指使泰国以无中生有的所谓泰国安全受到“威胁”为借口，向联合国安全理事会提出所谓“呼吁”，要求派“观察团”到泰国去“观察”，实际则是想替美国在联合国制造第二个朝鲜战争铺平道路。当美国及其追随者支持下的“泰国的呼吁”被安理会否决后，美国又在阴谋破坏联合国宪章，想召集联合国大会来使用多数表决机器，通过“泰国的呼吁”。只要正直的人都能够从这里看出美国是在如何继续践踏联合国。
    美国这一切卑鄙和野蛮的行径，要想逃避世界舆论的裁判是绝对不可能的，因为人类的良心并没有腐蚀，世界还有着正义和公道的力量。甚至连那些对共产主义并不同情和支持的人，都不能不同声谴责美国的侵略罪行。拉丁美洲的乌拉圭众议院就曾正式通过决议，抨击美国“对危地马拉的侵略是一种破坏美洲和平的阴谋，并且是剥夺自由人民的自决权利的行为。”据路透社七月四日从英国里丁发出的电讯说，英国的工党议员伊安·米卡多曾严厉地指斥“美帝国主义的思想意识上的伪装较之任何英帝国主义者所曾想出过的伪装更狡猾、更无耻和更伪善。”他并谴责美国“用廉价的和无耻的诡计使安全理事会不处理危地马拉遭受侵略的事件的时候，这种行动已经严重地打击了联合国组织和国际规矩的原则。”美国的“纽约邮报”也不能不忧心忡忡地指出：美国对危地马拉的侵略行径，使得
  “整个拉丁美洲（其实何止拉丁美洲）已经十分普遍的对美国的恐惧和憎恨心理只会有增无减。”因此，美国这一次侵略行动所获得的，实际上只是道义上的彻底破产和国际威望的更加低落。美国殖民主义面目在危地马拉的赤裸裸的暴露，对广泛人士识破和反对美国的罪恶政策，是有好处的。
