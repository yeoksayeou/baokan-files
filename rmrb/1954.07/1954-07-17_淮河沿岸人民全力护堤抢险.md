People along the Huai River Bank Fully Protect the Dikes and Engage in Emergency Rescue

[This newspaper dispatch] Since July 1st, the Huai River basin has experienced continuous heavy rainfall, generally exceeding 400 to 500 millimeters, with a concentration surpassing that of 1950 and 1931. The water levels in the Huai River's main and tributary streams have risen sharply. In Anhui Province, Zhengyangguan, Wangjiaba, Runheji, and other locations have successively reached or exceeded the guaranteed water level. To protect the lives and property of the people along the Huai River, the Huai River Harnessing Committee established flood control agencies at the beginning of the flood season. Tens of thousands of cadres from local Huai River Harnessing organizations have gone deep among the masses, actively leading dike protection and emergency rescue efforts. On July 7th, when the first flood peak of the Huai River arrived, the Huai River Harnessing Committee immediately instructed the utilization of flood storage projects such as the Meng Hong Depression and Chengxi Lake to intercept floodwaters. The Hong District in Fuyang Prefecture and the Nanrun Section, Qiujia Lake, and Jiangjia Lake flood diversion areas in Lu'an Prefecture also began diverting floodwaters. Currently, SuiPing, Shangcai, Runan, Pingyu, Xincai and other counties along the Hong and Ru rivers in Henan Province have fully engaged in flood prevention. Thousands upon thousands of organized people are prepared with a large number of flood control materials, vigilantly guarding the riverbanks day and night. The laborers on the dikes of the Sha, Ying, and Fen rivers are also guarding the dikes day and night with heightened vigilance. Niu Shucai, Deputy Secretary of the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and Huang Yan, Vice Chairman of the Anhui Provincial People's Government, have gone to Suxian, Bengbu, and other places to guide flood prevention work. The Anhui Provincial Department of Transportation has allocated and organized 22 steamboats and over 20,000 wooden boats from the Huai River Navigation Administration, all of which are being used for emergency rescue and the transport of materials and supplies.

To strengthen dike safety, Anhui Province has continued to organize 100,000 laborers along the Huai River. Plans are in place to universally raise the sub-dikes along the entire Huaihe North dike and the Yingdong dike below Yanghuzhen, as well as both banks of the Wo River, a tributary of the Huai River, by one meter within five to ten days, with thicker and reinforced embankments in dangerous areas. The estimated total earthwork is 1.1 million cubic meters.

    淮河沿岸人民全力护堤抢险
    【本报讯】淮河流域汛情紧张，沿淮地区广大干部群众，正全力投入护堤抢险。
    淮河流域从七月一日起，连降大雨，雨量一般都在四、五百公厘以上，雨量集中程度，超过一九五○年和一九三一年。淮河干支流水位直线上升。安徽境内正阳关、王家坝、润河集等地已先后达到或超过保证水位。为了保护淮河沿岸广大人民生命财产安全，早在汛期开始时，治淮委员会立即组成防汛机构，各地治淮机构成千上万的干部深入群众，积极领导护堤抢险。七月七日，当淮河第一次洪峰来到时，治淮委员会立即指示运用濛洪洼地、城西湖等蓄洪工程拦蓄洪水，阜阳专区和六安专区的南润段、邱家湖、姜家湖等行洪地区也开始行洪。目前河南省沿洪、汝河的遂平、上蔡、汝南、平舆、新蔡等县已全力投入防汛，有组织的成千上万的群众准备好了大批防汛器材，正日夜固守河堤。沙、颍、汾等河堤上的民工，也在百倍警惕地日夜护守堤防。中共安徽省委副书记牛树才、省人民政府副主席黄岩到宿县、蚌埠等地指导防汛工作。安徽省交通厅调拨和组织了淮河航务管理局二十二艘轮船和二万多只木船，全部用于抢险和抢运器材物资。
    为了加强堤防安全，安徽沿淮河各地已继续组织了十万民工，计划在五天到十天之内，将淮北堤防全线及杨湖镇以下颍东堤和淮河支流涡河两岸等，普遍加高一公尺子埂，险要地方培厚加戗堤。估计共有一百一十万公方土。
