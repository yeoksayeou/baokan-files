(Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, July 11th) The person in charge of the Wuhan Flood Control Headquarters gave a talk to our agency's reporter on July 9th, introducing the flood control situation in Wuhan, which is of concern to the city and the entire nation, and expressed strong confidence and sufficient material guarantees to ensure the safety of Wuhan.

The person in charge of the Wuhan Flood Control Headquarters first talked about the current water situation in Wuhan and the reasons for this year's major flooding. The Yangtze River water level in Wuhan reached 27.75 meters at 8:00 AM on July 9th, exceeding the water level on the same day in 1931. The reason for such a high water level is that the rainfall from January to June has already exceeded the city's average annual rainfall over the years. The average rainfall in June in previous years was 228.7 mm, but the actual rainfall in June this year reached 489 mm. At the same time, the rainfall in the Dongting Lake and Poyang Lake areas in the past six months has also mostly exceeded the local average annual rainfall; some stations in the Dongting Lake and Poyang Lake water systems have also broken the highest flood levels in history. As a result, the water level in Wuhan has risen accordingly.

The person in charge of the Wuhan Flood Control Headquarters talked about the deployment of flood control work in Wuhan. He said: Even under the highest water levels in history, the safety of the people of Wuhan and national construction must be ensured. He put forward the following specific guarantees: First, there are relatively strong defense projects. The existing levee projects in Wuhan, after years of reinforcement and consolidation since liberation, are basically solid. Moreover, the general height of the main levees is above 29.3 meters. Recently, great efforts have been made to reinforce and raise the levees, and many dangerous sections have been repaired. Second, the city has organized a strong flood control team. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, the people of the city and a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Wuhan have been mobilized and organized to actively participate in and support flood control work. Currently, nearly 100,000 people are working on the levees alone. Coupled with the huge reserve force spontaneously formed by people from all walks of life in the city, the flood control force is very strong. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, the people of the city will demonstrate great courage and wisdom to overcome the greatest floods. Third, Wuhan has abundant and powerful materials and equipment. All sectors of the city have submitted materials, equipment, and various means of transportation useful for flood control to the Flood Control Headquarters for dispatch and use, almost "giving whatever is needed." In particular, the strong support from the central government and the people of the country has resulted in the transfer of water pumps with 10,000 horsepower and 1.5 million sacks. The North China Electric Power Administration's train power station has specially come to support Wuhan's drainage work. The combination of the above three aspects constitutes a huge force for flood control, which is the basic guarantee for achieving flood control requirements and overcoming floods.

    武汉市防汛指挥部负责人发表谈话
    介绍武汉市防汛工作的部署情况
    表示有坚强信心战胜洪水确保武汉安全
    【新华社武汉十一日电】武汉市防汛指挥部负责人在七月九日向本社记者发表谈话，对于全市以至全国人民所关心的武汉防汛情况作了介绍，并表示有坚强信心和充分的物资保证，来确保武汉市的安全。
    武汉市防汛指挥部负责人首先谈到武汉市当前的水情和今年发生大水的原因。武汉市长江水位九日八时已经达到二十七点七五公尺，超过了一九三一年同一天的水位。发生这样高水位的原因是一月到六月份的雨量已经超过武汉市历年的年平均雨量。六月份历年平均雨量是二百二十八点七公厘，今年六月份实际雨量却已达到四百八十九公厘。同时，洞庭湖和鄱阳湖区域半年来的雨量也大都超过当地全年的平均雨量；洞庭湖和鄱阳湖水系也有一些站的水位突破了历年最高洪水位。这样，武汉市水位就相应升高。
    武汉市防汛指挥部负责人谈到武汉市防汛工作的部署情况。他说：即使在历年最高水位的情况下，也要确保武汉市人民和国家建设的安全。他提出了以下的具体保证：第一、有相当强大的防御工程。武汉市现有的堤防工程，经过解放后几年来培修加固，基本上是巩固的。而且，主要堤防的一般高度都在二十九点三公尺以上。最近又大力进行了堤防的加固和加高工程，抢修了许多险工。第二、全市已经组织了强大的防汛队伍。全市人民和人民解放军驻武汉市某部在中国共产党和人民政府领导下，已经动员和组织起来，积极参加和支援防汛工作。现在仅堤防上工作的就将近十万人。再加上全市各阶层人民自动组成的庞大的后备队伍，防汛的力量是非常强大的。全市人民在中国共产党和人民政府领导下，将发挥高度的勇敢和智慧，战胜最大的洪水。第三、武汉市有充沛的和强大的物资和装备。全市各方面都把对防汛有用的物资器材和各种运输工具提交防汛指挥部调遣使用，几乎是“要什么，给什么”。特别是中央和全国各地人民的有力的支持，调来的抽水机就有一万匹马力，麻袋就有一百五十万条。华北电业管理局列车发电站专门赶来支援武汉市的排水工作。以上三个方面结合起来，就构成了防汛的巨大力量，这些就是实现防汛要求，战胜洪水的基本保证。
