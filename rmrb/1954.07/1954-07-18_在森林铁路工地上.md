    On the Forest Railway Construction Site
    Xu Rongying
    In the remote northeastern border of our motherland, in the primeval forests of the Xing'an Mountains, the commanders and fighters of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army Railway Corps are carrying out the glorious task of defending and building the motherland. They are building a forest railway.

      On June 21st, the "People's Daily" carrying the draft constitution was distributed to the construction site, and cheers rang out across the site. From then on, while walking, eating, listening to the radio, attending political classes, reading the newspaper... everywhere people were talking about our country's first constitution. Studying and discussing the draft constitution became the most important part of political life at this forest construction site.
    Liang Zuodong, a special-class combat hero and battalion commander of a certain unit, was very excited after reading the draft constitution. He said, "The fruits of victory won by the people of the whole country over the past hundred years with their blood and sweat are now fixed in the constitution in legal form. In the old China, how could the people have had any democratic rights?" He talked about how his family had worked as beasts of burden for landlords for three generations and had no right to speak in the village, and as a result, were forced to flee to other provinces due to famine. Now, pointing to the draft constitution, he said excitedly, "It is clearly stipulated on this: citizens of the People's Republic of China are equal before the law." He expressed that he must study politics hard, actively study technology, and strive to complete the project ahead of schedule. Li Qiyuan, a third-class merit recipient and ordnance officer of the fourth company, said firmly when he saw the provision on the draft constitution that "Defending the motherland is the sacred duty of every citizen of the People's Republic of China": "I am a soldier of the Railway Corps, shouldering the dual task of defending and building the motherland. I will definitely study hard and do my job well in the future as a practical action to support the constitution."
      The slogan "Meet the promulgation of the draft constitution with practical actions" encourages everyone on the construction site. The comrades of the third platoon of the first company increased their work efficiency by 30%. The comrades of the machine gun and artillery second company also increased their work efficiency by 10%.
    The promulgation of the draft constitution has added new strength to the railway fighters to complete their tasks. They are determined to complete the forest railway as soon as possible, so that it can be connected with the heart of the motherland—Beijing—and with the various factories and mines of the motherland as soon as possible, transporting large quantities of timber to all parts of the country to support industrial construction, and fighting to build our country into a great socialist country as soon as possible!

    在森林铁路工地上
    徐荣瀛
    在遥远的祖国的东北边境，在兴安岭的原始森林里，人民解放军铁道兵某部的指战员，正执行着保卫祖国和建设祖国的光荣任务，他们正在修筑着一条森林铁路。
      六月二十一日，登着宪法草案的“人民日报”发到了工地，工地上响起了一片欢呼声。从此以后，走路的时候，吃饭的时候，听广播、上政治课、读报……到处都在谈论我国人民的第一部宪法。学习和讨论宪法草案成为这森林工地政治生活中最重要的内容了。
    某部特等战斗功臣、营长梁作栋看了宪法草案后十分激动，他说：“全国人民百十年来用血汗斗争得来的胜利果实，现在用法律的形式固定在宪法上了。在旧中国里人民那有一点民主权利呢？”他谈到他家三辈子替地主当牛当马，在村里没有说句话的权利，结果还被地主逼得往外省逃荒。现在他指着宪法草案兴奋地说：“这上面规定得明明白白：中华人民共和国公民在法律上一律平等。”他表示一定要努力学习政治，积极钻研技术，争取提前完成工程任务。三等功臣、四连军械员李奇渊，看到宪法草案上“保卫祖国是中华人民共和国每一个公民的神圣职责”一条时，他坚定地说：“我是铁道兵的战士，担负着保卫祖国建设祖国的双重任务，今后一定努力学习，做好工作，作为我拥护宪法的实际行动。”
      “以实际行动迎接宪法草案的公布”的口号鼓舞着工地上的每个人。一连三排的同志们提高工作效率百分之三十。机炮二连的同志们也提高工作效率百分之十。
    宪法草案的公布，给铁道战士们完成任务增加了新的力量，他们决心早日修通森林铁路，让这里和祖国的心脏——北京早日联结在一起，和祖国各个工厂矿山早日联结在一起，把大批木材源源不断地运往祖国各地，支援工业建设，为早日把我国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义国家而战斗！
