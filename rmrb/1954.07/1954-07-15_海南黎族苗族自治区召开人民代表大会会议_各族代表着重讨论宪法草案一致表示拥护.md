Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, July 14th: The first session of the First People's Congress of the Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Region, Guangdong Province, was held from July 2nd to 8th. The 214 representatives attending the meeting conscientiously discussed the work achievements of the autonomous region in the past two years, criticized the shortcomings in the work, and strengthened the unity between all nationalities. After heated discussions, the representatives passed a resolution on the work tasks of the autonomous region for the coming year and elected 24 representatives to attend the Guangdong Provincial People's Congress meeting.

    The meeting focused on discussing the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China, and representatives of all nationalities unanimously expressed their support. Chen Side, a Miao representative and Vice Chairman of the Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Region People's Government, said: "In 1942, the Kuomintang reactionaries, under the guise of issuing 'citizen certificates,' concentrated more than a thousand Miao men and women in Zhongping Township, Qiongzhong County, and then had them all killed after surrounding them with troops. Under reactionary rule, the Miao people didn't even have the right to survive. Our Draft Constitution stipulates that all nationalities are equal and prohibits discrimination and oppression against any nationality, which is truly good news for all nationalities." Li representative Wang Yujin said: "The Draft Constitution is something our people of all nationalities obtained through hard work and bloody struggle. In the past, the Li people took up earthen guns, bows and arrows, and stones to fight against the Kuomintang reactionaries in order to strive for freedom and equality. After years of struggle, we finally enjoy freedom and equality under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. Now the Draft Constitution fixes the achievements of the people's revolution, which is really great, and we Li people fully support it." Representatives of more than 1,600 Hui people in Huihui Township, Ya County, also expressed that the Draft Constitution takes care of the interests of minority nationalities in a meticulous manner, and in the future, the Hui people must unite even more with their brothers of all nationalities.

    海南黎族苗族自治区召开人民代表大会会议
    各族代表着重讨论宪法草案一致表示拥护
    【新华社广州十四日电】广东省海南黎族苗族自治区第一届第一次人民代表大会会议在七月二日到八日举行。出席会议的二百一十四名代表，认真讨论了自治区成立两年来的工作成绩，并批评了工作中的缺点，加强了各民族之间的团结。代表们经过热烈讨论，通过了自治区今后一年工作任务的决议。选举了出席广东省人民代表大会会议的二十四名代表。
    会议着重讨论了中华人民共和国宪法草案，各族人民代表一致表示拥护。苗族人民代表、海南黎族苗族自治区人民政府副主席陈斯德说：一九四二年国民党反动派以发“公民证”为名，在琼中县中平乡集中了一千多苗族男女，用军队包围后将他们全部杀死。在反动统治下，苗族人民连生存的权利也没有。而我们的宪法草案规定了各民族一律平等，禁止对任何民族的歧视和压迫，实在是各民族的福音。黎族人民代表王玉锦说：“宪法草案是我们各族人民千辛万苦、流血斗争才得到的。过去，黎族人民拿起土枪、弓箭、石头来和国民党反动派斗争，为的就是争取自由平等。经过多年的奋斗，我们终于在共产党和毛主席的领导下，享受到了自由平等的权利。现在宪法草案把人民革命成果固定下来，这实在太好了，我们黎族人民完全拥护。”崖县回辉乡一千六百多回族人民的代表，也表示宪法草案照顾少数民族的利益真是无微不至，今后回民更要和各族兄弟团结。
