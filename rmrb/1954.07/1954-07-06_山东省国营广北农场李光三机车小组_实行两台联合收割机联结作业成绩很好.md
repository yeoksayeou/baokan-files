    The Li Guangsan Tractor Team of the State-owned Guangbei Farm in Shandong Province
    Achieves Excellent Results by Implementing Joint Operation of Two Combine Harvesters
    The Li Guangsan Tractor Team of the State-owned Guangbei Farm in Shandong Province, learning from advanced Soviet experience, used a Soviet DT-54 medium-sized tractor to tow two Stalin No. 6 trailed combine harvesters for joint operation during this year's wheat harvest, achieving good results.
    The joint operation of two harvesters requires the coordinated work of three engines (the tractor and each combine harvester has an engine), which must be synchronized and cooperate as a whole. This requires highly skilled operating techniques. The tractor drivers and combine harvester operators of the Li Guangsan Tractor Team made thorough preparations before the wheat harvest, carrying out full maintenance work on the machinery to ensure the smooth operation of the two harvesters. On June 12th, the day shift set a record of harvesting 89 mu per hour, exceeding the quota by 37%. The fuel consumption of the combine harvesters was reduced by 43% compared to the original quota. The shift completed 774 mu of work, exceeding the original shift quota by 44%. The direct cost per mu of harvesting was reduced by 33% compared to the quota. During the wheat harvest, the joint operation of two trailed combine harvesters at the Guangbei Farm was carried out continuously in day and night shifts. The quality of the harvest met all requirements. This can improve work efficiency, reduce costs, and free up tractors for field operations such as summer plowing and summer planting during the busy summer harvest and planting season.

    山东省国营广北农场李光三机车小组
    实行两台联合收割机联结作业成绩很好
    山东省国营广北农场李光三机车小组，学习苏联先进经验，在今年麦收期间，以一台苏联的德特五十四号中型拖拉机拖带两台斯大林六号拖拉式联合收割机，实行联结作业，成绩良好。
    两台收割机联结作业是三个发动机（拖拉机、联合收割机每台各有一部发动机）协同工作，必须步调一致，合作得像一个整体。这就需要高度熟练的操作技术。李光三机车小组拖拉机手和联合收割机手，早在麦收以前，就做了周密的准备，对机具进行了充分的检修工作，使两台收割机联结作业得以顺利进行。六月十二日白天班创每小时收割八十九亩的纪录，超过定额百分之三十七。联合收割机耗油量较原订定额降低了百分之四十三。班工作量完成了七百七十四亩，超过原订的班定额百分之四十四。每亩收割直接费用较定额降低百分之三十三。麦收期间，广北农场的两台拖拉式联合收割机联结作业，一直实行日夜班收割。收割的质量都合乎要求。这样便可提高工作效率，降低成本，并可在紧张的夏收夏种期间腾出拖拉机，进行伏耕及夏种等田间作业。
