Defeating Waterlogging, Ensuring a Bumper Harvest

    The drainage of accumulated water in some areas of the Hangzhou-Jiaxing-Huzhou Plain in Zhejiang Province has received strong support from workers in cities such as Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou. Currently, the accumulated water in many rice paddies has been drained. Many farmers gratefully told the workers that they would work hard to increase grain production to support the country's industrial construction.

    Cadres from Party and government organs at all levels in Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou in Zhejiang Province are fully engaged in leading farmers to overcome natural disasters. This is Duan Shuyou, Deputy Mayor of Jiaxing City, visiting farmers in the suburbs to understand their production and living conditions.

    The Party and government organs of Wuxing County, a famous rice-producing area in Zhejiang Province, organized more than 260 water pumps, over 30,000 waterwheels, and 100,000 farmers to participate in flood drainage work. This is workers from the Huzhou Power Plant setting up power lines to the countryside to help farmers in Xinshu Township, Dailin District, Wuxing County, start water pumps to drain floodwater.

    The struggle of farmers to overcome natural disasters has received support from all sides. This is young students from Jiaxing City using their Sundays to go to the countryside to help farmers pump water and drain floodwater.

    Farmers from entire villages and townships in waterlogged areas have united to finally overcome the floods and rescue this bountiful rice field.

    The flood has finally been overcome by the people, and the accumulated water in many rice fields has been drained. This is the early rice that has already headed in the No. 1 Agricultural Production Cooperative of Pai Tou Town, Zhuji County.

    战胜水涝，确保丰收
    浙江省杭（州）嘉（兴）湖（州）平原部分地区的排除积水工作，得到了杭州、嘉兴、湖州等城市工人的大力支援。目前很多稻田的积水已经排干。许多农民感激地向工人表示，一定要努力增产粮食支援国家工业建设。浙江日报稿徐永辉、王奎源摄
    浙江省杭（州）嘉（兴）湖（州）各级党政机关干部全力投入了领导农民战胜自然灾害的斗争。这是嘉兴市人民政府副市长段书友访问市郊农民，了解生产和生活情况。
    浙江省著名产稻地区吴兴县党政机关组织了抽水机二百六十余台、水车三万余部和农民十万人投入排涝工作。这是湖州电厂的工人把电线架到农村，帮助吴兴县戴林区新蜀乡农民开动抽水机进行排涝。
    农民战胜自然灾害的斗争得到了各方面的支援。这是嘉兴市的青年学生利用星期日下乡为农民车水排涝。
    水涝地区的整村整乡的农民都联合起来，终于战胜了洪水，抢救了这一片丰盛的稻田。
    洪水终于被人们战胜了，许多稻田的积水已经排干。这是诸暨县牌头镇第一农业生产合作社的已经出穗的早稻。
