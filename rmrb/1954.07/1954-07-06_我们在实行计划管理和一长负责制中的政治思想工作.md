Party Life

	Our Political and Ideological Work in Implementing Planned Management and the System of One Chief Responsible
	The Chinese Communist Party Jiang'an Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory Committee
	Our factory's production situation in 1953 was as follows: In the first half of the year, we failed to complete our tasks every month, production was very uneven, the rate of rework and repair was high, and repair costs were high. In the second half of the year, we overfulfilled the state plan every month, the rate of production balance gradually increased, and repair costs decreased.
	The change in production situation throughout the past year also reflects the changes in the Party's work. The poor production situation in the first half of the year was inseparable from the serious shortcomings in the Party's political and ideological work. At that time, although we also did some work, this work played a certain role in promoting production. However, because we did not guarantee the implementation of planned management and the system of one chief responsible through the Party's political and ideological work, but blindly talked about "guaranteeing," the administrative work was chaotic, and the Party's work was also chaotic. The chaos in the Party's work was manifested in the following aspects: First, the Party Committee did not form a strong leadership core, there was a lack of criticism and self-criticism among the members, meetings often resulted in discussions without decisions, and resolutions were often not implemented. Second, the Party organization was accustomed to general appeals and blind guarantees, and was not good at conducting in-depth and meticulous political and ideological work around key issues in production. For example, when "February 7th" was approaching, the Party organization used the slogan "Welcome 'February 7th', resolutely complete the production plan" to encourage people, and the same was true for "May Day" and "July 1st." Third, the Party organization did not truly establish a normal working order, the arrangement of work was fragmented and chaotic, lacked overall consideration, and most of them were not inspected. In the first half of the year, the Party Committee proposed promoting sixteen sets of advanced experiences in a very short period of time. The scope of work of the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League was also not clearly defined. In the workshops, the Party's "all-encompassing" work style of taking over administrative matters was very serious, and the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League all came forward in everything. Some branch secretaries rushed around everywhere to urge for parts and materials, and were busy all the time, relaxing political and ideological work. The Party's organizational life was also unsound, and some branch committees did not hold meetings for a long time, nor did they promptly check the work and ideological situation of Party members. In this way, the Party organization could not truly play the role of guaranteeing and supervising production, and could not truly become a strong fighting fortress in the enterprise.
	We were not sufficiently aware of these shortcomings at the beginning. Later, when we became aware of them, we were troubled by not finding a way out. From the end of June to July last year, under the leadership of the Municipal Party Committee, the Party Committee systematically examined its work, carried out criticism and self-criticism, and exposed serious shortcomings in its work. In addition, the instructions of the Ministry of Railways of the Central Government made the Party Committee realize that planned management and the system of one chief responsible are advanced Soviet scientific enterprise management systems, and are also suitable for the production situation of railway factories. The Municipal Party Committee also instructed us: We must regard the realization of planned management and the system of one chief responsible as a common and serious political task of the Party, government, trade union, and Communist Youth League in the entire factory. The realization of planned management and the system of one chief responsible requires cadres and workers to consciously obey the plan and obey command on the basis of a high degree of ideological awareness. The Party Committee expected that in the implementation of this set of scientific and advanced management systems, it would inevitably encounter resistance from old ideas and old habits. Therefore, the Party Committee proposed: The fundamental task of the Party organization in this work is to actively support the establishment of the new system with political and ideological work.
	We first led all cadres to conscientiously study the Ministry Order No. 301 of the Ministry of Railways of the Central Government on the implementation of planned management and the system of one chief responsible, and the relevant basic professional knowledge. At the beginning, many cadres were unwilling to study, thinking that "studying is useless," or saying, "Ministry Order No. 301 is nothing more than that." The Party Committee promptly criticized these erroneous views, and called on everyone not to perfunctorily, but to honestly learn various basic knowledge. The Party Committee also decided to conduct tests after the study, and those who did not learn well would be asked to study again until they learned it. The Party Committee's organization member failed the first test, so he studied again, and passed the second test. Although this study did not last long, it achieved the desired results due to strong organizational leadership and the concentration of cadres' minds. Most of the cadres who participated in the study initially understood the essence of planned management and the system of one chief responsible, and were able to use the main items in it, which improved the professional level of the cadres and enabled the cadres of the entire factory to achieve a consensus in ideological understanding of the implementation of planned management and the system of one chief responsible.
	In order to guarantee the establishment of this new system, the Party organization also resolutely fought against all kinds of old ideas and old habits. At the beginning of the implementation of planned management and the system of one chief responsible, the ideological resistance of cadres and the masses was very serious, and many people still lacked a high degree of consciousness and responsibility for completing the plan and obeying command. In the past, foreman and foremen arranged work according to their own plans, but now they must strictly follow the plan, and some people found it troublesome. After the implementation of planned management and the system of one chief responsible, the requirements for completing the plan were very strict. No matter which unit failed to complete the task that day, it would be severely criticized at the daily production meeting held once a day. Many people could not stand this severe criticism. Many leading cadres of workshops ran to the Party Committee to complain: "It's not good, the requirements for the plan are too strict, how can we bear it!" Some people clamored that the daily production meeting was a "three-court joint trial," "undemocratic," and "coercive order." Many people therefore felt wronged and dissatisfied, and became passive and retreated. All six foremen in the locomotive workshop were emotional, and four of them applied to resign as a result. Some people even resisted criticism, made false reports to the leadership, and made empty promises, etc.
	In view of this situation, the Party organization widely launched propaganda and mobilization work to obey the plan and obey command through various organizations. We used blackboard newspapers, big-character posters, broadcasts, and charts published in the workshops every day to promptly commend advanced people and advanced deeds in the implementation of planned management and the system of one chief responsible, criticize units and individuals that failed to complete the plan, encourage employees in weak workshops and weak foreman areas to work hard to overcome difficulties and catch up with advanced workshops, and mobilize employees in the entire factory to support these weak links to ensure the balance of production. In this way, an atmosphere of carrying out production according to plan and obeying leadership was created in the entire factory, so that those who had resistant thoughts were educated everywhere.
	The Party Committee and various branches also criticized these people with resistant thoughts and patiently and repeatedly explained the principles to help them understand their thoughts and solve their difficulties. Many foremen and foremen in the locomotive workshop could not stand the criticism of the workshop director at the daily production meeting, and some even openly resisted. When the workshop director asked questions, they sat there and ignored him. At this time, the branch found a typical example - foreman Li Liqing (a Party member), and asked him to make a review at the branch meeting, where everyone analyzed and criticized him. As a result, not only did it help him correct his mistakes, but it also educated everyone. Once, in order to ensure that the painters could catch up with the progress as soon as possible, the director of the passenger car workshop asked the carpenters to make chairs first when arranging the daily plan. For the convenience of doing his own work, the carpenter foreman (a Party member) still made windows first and then chairs according to his own plan, ignoring the daily plan. After the branch secretary found out about it at noon that day, he immediately talked to him, criticized his departmentalism and undisciplined behavior, and told him that the words and deeds of Party members have a great influence among the masses. After realizing his mistake, the foreman immediately made chairs first according to the plan, and adjusted the labor organization to ensure the realization of the daily plan. The locomotive workshop foreman Liu Xinghan put the plan form at home and did not produce according to the plan. He was criticized at the daily production meeting and thought he was "oppressed." Later, he simply wrote a letter of resignation, preparing to quit. The branch secretary and the Party Committee's organization member repeatedly talked to him to help him solve ideological problems. Later, he was also admitted to attend the factory-level daily production meeting as a nonvoting delegate. When he saw that the workshop director who failed to complete the plan was severely criticized by the factory director, he realized that he should be criticized for failing to complete the national plan. The workshop director criticized him not intentionally to make things difficult for him, but to be responsible for the national plan. After understanding the principles, he happily asked the superiors to teach him work methods, and the plan form was never left his hand again. Since then, the production plan of his work area has always been completed very well.
	In accordance with the spirit of the system of one chief responsible, the Party Committee correctly arranged the relationship between the Party and the administration, and at the same time, based on the compilation and issuance procedures of the plan, initially established the Party's work system and normal order.
	In the past, we had a situation where "everyone is a superior, and everyone gives orders." Often, for the repair of a small part, the workshop director, technicians, and branch secretary would each hold their own opinions and argue endlessly. The workers were troubled by "not knowing who to listen to," and production was delayed as a result. Since the implementation of the system of one chief responsible, the Party Committee has clearly stipulated that the Party organization should do political and ideological work, cadre work, and Party building work. The Party organization's opinions on administrative work can only be submitted to the administrative负责人 [responsible person] in the form of suggestions. At the same time, the Party Committee strengthened its guarantee and supervision role over production. Regularly listening to the work reports of the factory director or workshop director is an important system for us to guarantee and supervise administrative work. The factory director reports to the Party Committee every month on the production and financial activities of the entire factory, puts forward the plan for the next month and the technical organization measures for completing the plan, and asks the Party Committee to review and discuss it. For example, the factory director proposed the target of the first quarter plan of this year at the Party Committee meeting. This target was based on the average number of the first half and the second half of last year, which violated the instructions of the superiors, because the superiors instructed that the production in the first quarter of this year should not be lower than the actual production performance in the fourth quarter of last year. Therefore, the Party Committee meeting criticized the conservative thinking of the administrative leadership. The factory director accepted the opinion and revised the plan, which was then approved by the Party Committee.
	After the Party Committee discusses and approves the administrative plan and makes the Party's guarantee plan every month, it will convene a plenary meeting of Party members in the factory to summarize the completion of the plan in the previous month, communicate the plan for this month, and put forward the main measures. Each branch will first convene a branch committee or an enlarged branch committee, focusing on discussing whether the workshop's administrative plan is conservative, finding out the key to production, and putting forward requirements to each organization separately to make a branch work plan. The branch secretary reports the branch work plan at the branch meeting, which is discussed and revised by all Party members. After the plan is issued, the Party organization often pays attention to checking the implementation situation, discovering weak links and guaranteeing solutions. The负责人 [responsible person] of the Party Committee participates in the factory's morning dynamic table analysis meeting and daily production meeting every day to grasp the completion of the plan. A branch daily report system has also been established within the Party. The branch secretary here not only reports the competition situation, the solution of key problems, etc., but also reports the ideological problems and solutions in these areas. The Party Committee's responsible cadres go deep into the scene in a targeted manner to understand the situation in key areas based on these situations, so as to discover and analyze key problems in production, and then use political and ideological work to jointly solve these problems with the administrative aspects to ensure the balance of production. The Party's organizational life is also relatively regular. Various routine meetings (such as the Party Committee meeting, branch meeting) have fixed times, the Party's work has formal plans and schedules, the meetings have records, and the discussion items have formal resolutions, etc. The spare time of the entire factory has also been unified. The chaotic phenomenon in the work has been greatly reduced, and the work efficiency has been improved.
	Judging from the situation in our factory during this period, it is necessary to rely on the Party's strong political and ideological leadership to ensure the implementation of the system of one chief responsible and the balanced completion of the national plan. At the same time, the implementation of the system of one chief responsible and planned management has enabled the Party organization to get rid of the past "all-encompassing" handicraft leadership method, and to concentrate on considering political and ideological work issues. The Party's work has therefore taken a step forward. However, there are still many shortcomings in our work, the Party Committee's political and ideological level is still very low, the criticism from bottom to top within the Party is not enough, and various work systems are not consolidated and improved enough. These all remain to be worked hard on in the future.

    我们在实行计划管理和一长负责制中的政治思想工作
    中共江岸机车车辆修理工厂委员会
    我们工厂在一九五三年的生产情况是：上半年月月完不成任务，生产很不均衡，返工复修率大，检修成本高；下半年则月月超额完成国家计划，生产均衡率逐月提高，检修成本降低。
    去年一年中生产情况的变化也是党的工作变化的反映。上半年生产情况不好是和党的政治思想工作上的严重缺点分不开的。当时，我们虽然也做了一些工作，这些工作对推动生产也起了一定的作用。但是，由于我们没有通过党的政治思想工作保证计划管理和一长负责制的贯彻实现，而是盲目地谈“保证”，因此，行政工作混乱，党的工作也混乱。党的工作的混乱表现在以下几个方面：一、党委会没有形成坚强的领导核心，委员之间缺乏批评和自我批评，会议往往是议而不决，决议也往往贯彻不下去。二、党组织习惯于一般号召和盲目保证，而不善于围绕着生产中的关键问题进行深入细致的政治思想工作。比如，快到“二七”了，党组织就用“迎接‘二七’，坚决完成生产计划”的口号来鼓动一下，逢到“五一”、“七一”，也是照例的号召。三、党组织没有真正建立起正常的工作秩序，布置工作零碎杂乱，缺乏通盘考虑，而且大多没有进行检查。上半年党委在很短时间内就提出推广十六套先进经验。党、行政、工会、青年团的工作范围也划分不清。车间里，党包办行政的“一揽子”工作作风很严重，不论什么事都是党、政、工、团一齐出面。有些支部书记到处催部件、要材料，东跑西串忙个不停，放松了政治思想工作。党的组织生活也不健全，有的支部的支委会议长期不开，也不及时检查党员的工作和思想情况。这样，党组织就不能真正起到保证和监督生产的作用，不能真正成为企业中的坚强的战斗堡垒。
    对这些缺点，开始我们是认识不足的，后来，觉察到了，又苦于找不到出路。去年六月底到七月间，在市委的领导下，党委系统地检查了工作，开展了批评和自我批评，揭发了工作中的严重缺点，加上中央铁道部的指示，党委会认识到计划管理和一长负责制是苏联先进的科学的企业管理制度，同时适合铁路工厂的生产情况。市委也指示我们：一定要把实现计划管理和一长负责制当做全厂党、政、工、团的一项共同的严重的政治任务。实现计划管理和一长负责制要求干部和工人群众在高度的思想觉悟基础上自觉地服从计划，服从指挥。党委预计到在贯彻这一套科学的先进管理制度时，必然要遇到旧思想旧习气的反抗。因此，党委提出：党组织在这一工作中的根本任务就在于用政治思想工作来积极支持新制度的确立。
    我们首先领导全体干部认真地学习了中央铁道部关于实行计划管理和一长负责制的三○一号部令和有关的基本业务知识。开始不少干部不乐意学习，认为“学了也没有用”，或者说：“三○一号部令也不过如此”。党委及时批判了这些错误的看法，号召大家不要敷衍塞责，要老老实实地学会各种基本知识。党委并决定在学习后进行测验，对学得不好的叫他重学，直到学会为止。党委组织委员第一次测验不及格，便再学，第二次测验就及格了。这次学习虽然时间不长，但由于组织领导坚强，干部精神集中，收到了应有的效果。参加学习的干部大都初步领会了计划管理和一长负责制的精神实质，并能运用其中的主要项目，提高了干部的业务水平，并使全厂干部对于实行计划管理和一长负责制在思想认识上取得了一致。
    为了保证这一新制度的建立，党组织还坚决地与形形色色的旧思想、旧习气进行斗争。开始实行计划管理和一长负责制时，干部和群众中的思想抵触是很严重的，很多人对于完成计划服从指挥还缺乏高度的自觉性和责任感。过去，领工员和工长都是各人照自己的打算布置工作，现在要严格地按计划办事，有些人就嫌麻烦。实行计划管理和一长负责制后，对完成计划的要求非常严格，不管那个单位当天完不成任务，在每天一次的日常生产会议上就要受到严厉的批评。很多人受不了这种严厉的批评。不少车间的领导干部跑到党委会诉苦：“不行呀，对计划要求太严格了，那能吃得消！”有些人吵嚷着说日常生产会议是“三堂会审”、“不讲民主”、“强迫命令”。很多人因此抱屈不满、消极退缩。机车车间六个领工员都闹情绪，其中有四个因此呈请辞职。有些人甚至抗拒批评，向领导做假报告、空保证等。
    根据这种情况，党组织通过各个组织广泛地展开了服从计划服从指挥的宣传鼓动工作。我们每天利用黑板报、大字报、广播以及车间公布的图表等，及时表扬实行计划管理和一长负责制的先进人物先进事迹，批判完不成计划的单位和个人，鼓励薄弱车间和薄弱领工区的职工努力克服困难，赶上先进车间，并动员全厂职工群众支援这些薄弱环节，以保证生产的均衡。这样，就在全厂造成了一种按计划进行生产和服从领导的气氛，使那些有抵触思想的人到处受到教育。
    党委和各支部同时对这些有抵触思想的人还进行了批评并且耐心地反复讲清道理，帮助他们弄通思想，解决困难。机车车间不少领工员、工长受不了车间主任日常生产会议上的批评，有的甚至公开抗拒，车间主任问话时坐在那里置之不理。这时支部就从中找出了典型——领工员李立清（党员），叫他在支部大会上进行检讨，大家分析批判。结果不但帮助他改正了错误，并且教育了大家。有一次，客车车间主任为了保证油漆工能够尽快赶上进度，布置日计划时要求木工先做椅子。木工领工员（党员）为了自己做活方便，仍然按照自己的打算先做窗户再做椅子，把日计划丢在一边不管。当天中午支部书记发现后，立即找他谈话，批评了他的本位主义思想和无纪律行为，告诉他党员的一言一动在群众中都有很大的影响。领工员认识自己的错误后，立即按计划先做椅子，并且调整了劳动组织，保证了日计划的实现。机车车间领工员刘兴汉把计划表放在家里，不按计划生产，在日常生产会议上受了批评，就认为是“受压迫”，后来索性写了一张辞职申请书，准备不干。支部书记、党委组织委员分别和他反复谈话，帮助他解决思想问题。后来，又吸收他列席厂级日常生产会议。当他看到完不成计划的车间主任受到厂长的严厉批评后，他认识到完不成国家计划应该受批评，车间主任批评他并不是有意和他为难，而是对国家计划负责。想通了道理，他就高高兴兴地要求上级教给工作办法，计划表也再不离手了。以后，他这个工区的生产计划一直都完成得很好。
    党委根据一长负责制的精神正确地安排了党和行政的关系，同时，依据计划的编制和下达程序，初步建立了党的工作制度和正常秩序。
    过去，我们这里是“人人是上级，个个发号令”，往往为一个小部件的检修问题，车间主任、技术员、支部书记也会各持己见，争论不休，工人苦于“不知听谁的好”，生产因而延误下来。实行一长负责制以来，党委明确地规定，党组织应做政治思想工作、干部工作以及建党工作等。党组织对行政工作的意见，只能以建议方式向行政负责人提出。党委同时加强了对生产的保证监督作用。定期听取厂长或车间主任的工作汇报就是我们保证监督行政工作的一项重要制度。厂长每月向党委汇报本月全厂生产财务活动情况，提出下月的计划和完成计划的技术组织措施，请党委审查讨论。比如，厂长在党委会上提出了今年第一季度计划的指标，这个指标是以去年上半年和下半年的平均数为根据，这就违背了上级的指示，因为上级指示要求今年第一季的生产不能低于去年第四季的生产实绩。因此，党委会上批评了行政领导方面的保守思想。厂长接受了意见，重新修改了计划，党委才予以通过。
    党委每月讨论通过行政计划做出党的保证计划后，就召开一次全厂党员大会，总结上月计划完成情况，传达本月计划，提出主要措施。各支部则首先召开支委会或扩大支委会，着重讨论车间行政计划是否保守，找出生产关键，分别对各个组织提出要求，做出支部工作计划。支部书记在支部大会上报告支部工作计划，由全体党员讨论修正。计划下达后，党组织经常注意检查执行情况发现薄弱环节并保证解决，党委的负责人每天都参加厂内早晨的动态表分析会议和日常生产会议，以掌握计划的完成情况。在党内还建立了支部日报表制。支部书记在这里不仅报告竞赛情况、关键问题解决的情况等，并且汇报这些方面的思想问题及解决情况。党委负责干部根据这些情况有目的地深入现场重点了解情况，以便发现并分析生产中的关键问题，而后用政治思想工作协同行政方面共同解决这些问题，保证生产的均衡。党内组织生活也比较正轨了。各种例会（如党委会、支部大会）均有固定时间，党的工作都有正式计划和进度表，会议有纪录，讨论事项有正式决议等。全厂的业余时间也有了统一分配。工作中的混乱现象大为减少，工作效率有了提高。
    从我们工厂这一时期的情况看，必须依靠党的强有力的政治思想领导，才能够保证一长负责制的实施和均衡地完成国家计划，同时，一长负责制和计划管理的实施，使党组织摆脱了过去的“一揽子”的手工业的领导方法，得以集中力量考虑政治思想工作问题，党的工作因此向前跃进一步。但是，我们工作中的缺点还很多，党委的政治思想水平还很低，党内自下而上的批评开展的还不够，各种工作制度还不够巩固和完善。这些都有待于今后的努力。
