    The agreement on the cessation of hostilities and restoration of peace in Indochina has been reached at the Geneva Conference. All the people of China and all peace-loving people of the world are delighted and encouraged.
    The conclusion of the Indochina issue agreement once again proves that complex international disputes can be resolved through peaceful consultation. The victory of the principle of peaceful consultation is the failure of the American "policy of strength."
    The conclusion of the Indochina issue agreement also proves the unshakable position and role of the People's Republic of China in international affairs. The Chinese delegation, headed by Premier Zhou Enlai, adhering to our country's consistent peaceful foreign policy, together with the Soviet and Democratic Republic of Vietnam delegations at the Geneva Conference, defeated the US's various obstructions and sabotage, and made an indelible contribution to the conclusion of the Indochina issue agreement. There are still a few people in the world who attempt to exclude the People's Republic of China from international affairs. The Geneva Conference proves that their delusions are in vain.
    The agreement reached at the Geneva Conference is of great significance for Asian peace and world peace, and we express our full support. However, US imperialism has not yet learned the lesson it deserves. It is still deploying aggressive blocs and carrying out aggressive activities in Asia, and wants to continue to obstruct our liberation of Taiwan. We should maintain a high degree of vigilance and work hard on national construction and national defense construction. We must liberate Taiwan, and we have the confidence and strength to smash all the conspiracies of the American aggressors.

    中国人民外交学会会长张奚若的谈话
    印度支那停战和恢复和平问题已在日内瓦会议达成协议。全中国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民都感到欢欣鼓舞。
    印度支那问题协议的达成，又一次证明了复杂的国际争端是可以通过和平协商的方法来解决的。和平协商原则的胜利就是美国“实力政策”的失败。
    印度支那问题协议的达成，也证明了中华人民共和国在国际事务中的不可动摇的地位和作用。以周恩来总理为首的我国代表团本着我国一贯的和平外交政策，在日内瓦会议上和苏联、越南民主共和国代表团一起，击败了美国多方的阻挠和破坏，对印度支那问题协议的达成，作了不可磨灭的贡献。世界上还有少数人企图排斥中华人民共和国于国际事务之外，日内瓦会议证明他们的妄想是徒然的。
    日内瓦会议达成的协议，对亚洲和平和世界和平有极大的意义，我们表示完全支持。但美帝国主义还没有从此获得应有的教训，它还在亚洲布置侵略集团，进行侵略活动，并要继续阻挠我解放台湾。我们应保持高度的警惕，努力于国家建设和国防建设，我们一定要解放台湾，我们有信心也有力量粉碎美国侵略者的一切阴谋。（新华社）
