The construction project of the large-scale Soviet Exhibition Center in the western suburbs of Beijing, capable of accommodating 80,000 visitors daily, is expected to be completed in September this year. This is the result of nearly a year of effort and support from all parties, under the guidance of Soviet experts and the participation of all staff, cadres, and the Construction Engineering Corps of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

After the completion of the Soviet Exhibition Center, an exhibition will be held soon. In the Industry Hall and Agriculture Hall, we will see the brilliant achievements of the Soviet people in industrial and agricultural production construction over the past 30 years, and see all kinds of new machines. In the Culture Hall, Cinema Hall, and open-air theater, we will see the high achievements of Soviet socialist culture and art. This will be of great help and significance for us to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and for enhancing the friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union.

The right picture is a corner of the construction site of the Soviet Exhibition Center. The magnificent Central Hall is topped with a gilded iron tower.

All the photos in this issue's pictorial, except those with attributions, were taken by Wang Zhiyuan and Zhang Li of this newspaper.

Soviet Academician of the Academy of Architecture, Stalin Prize winner, architect V. Andreyev and Chinese engineering designers study design issues.

The huge bronze Soviet national emblem and the emblems of the sixteen Soviet republics are manufactured by the Beijing No. 1 Hardware Production Cooperative. This is the nearly completed Soviet national emblem.

A floral decorator is installing the plaster floral decorations on the ceiling and capitals of the restaurant.

Twelve youth shock brigades have been established in the exhibition area, giving play to the pioneering spirit and positive role of young people. This is a youth shock brigade, teams one and two, working on smoothing cement squares.

The students of the Sculpture Department of the Central Academy of Fine Arts, like everyone participating in the construction of the exhibition hall, feel honored to serve this great building, which symbolizes Sino-Soviet friendship. These are some decorative reliefs they are making. (Manuscript from the Sculpture Department of the Central Academy of Fine Arts)

This elderly painter is carefully gilding the carved ceiling of the Exhibition Center's cinema hall.

All the commanders and fighters of a certain regiment of the Construction Engineering Corps of the Chinese People's Liberation Army have made great contributions to the construction of the exhibition hall. These soldiers are transporting stones for the concrete mixer.

Trucks coming and going in front of the portico of the Agricultural Hall of the Exhibition Center are transporting building materials to the open-air theater construction site.

The largest building in the exhibition hall is the Culture Hall, but the architecture of the Industrial Hall is also very magnificent. Look, the crane unloading exhibition machines looks so small inside the Industrial Hall.

Staff of the Soviet Exhibition in China Office welcome exhibits successively shipped from the Soviet Union at Xizhimen Railway Station.

    规模宏大的苏联展览馆建筑工程
    在北京西郊规模宏大、每天能容八万人参观的苏联展览馆的建筑工程，在苏联专家的指导下，经过参加工程工作的全体职工、干部、中国人民解放军建筑工程部队近一年的努力和各方面的支援，可以在今年九月完工。
    苏联展览馆落成后，即将举行展览会。我们可以在工业馆、农业馆里看到苏联人民三十多年来在工农业生产建设上的辉煌成就，看到各式各样的新型机器；可以在文化馆、电影馆和露天剧场里看到苏维埃社会主义文化艺术的高度成就。这对于我们学习苏联先进经验，对于增进中苏两国人民之间的友谊，都有很大的帮助和重大的意义。
