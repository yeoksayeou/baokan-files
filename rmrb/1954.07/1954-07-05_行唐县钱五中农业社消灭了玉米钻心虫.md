Xintang County Qian Wuzhong Agricultural Production Cooperative in Hebei Province promptly controlled corn borers, inspiring surrounding farmers.

The Qian Wuzhong Agricultural Production Cooperative in Qicun, Xingtang County, planted 130 mu of corn this year. The seedlings are now over two chi tall, and just about to tassel, but in early June they suddenly discovered corn borers on the corn seedlings. The cooperative quickly convened a meeting of five production team leaders and twenty Communist Youth League members. A technical cadre introduced the life habits and growth patterns of the corn borer, determined prevention and control measures, and prepared fourteen jin of 6% wettable "666" powder, diluting each jin of powder with 400 to 450 jin of water for prevention and control. Initially, some cooperative members were afraid that their efforts would be wasted if they couldn't kill the insects and instead damaged the corn. Production team leader Fu Zhixue led five primary school students, carrying the diluted pesticide in kettles and wine bottles. They plugged the mouths of the wine bottles with broken sorghum stalks, allowing the pesticide to drip out slowly, and poured the pesticide into the corn’s "trumpet head" (where the leaves join the stalk). After treating eight mu in this way, they checked the next day and found that all the corn borers were dead, and the corn was not harmed. They then mobilized eighteen women and students, each with a wine bottle filled with "666" pesticide, and in three days they eliminated the corn borers from ninety-six mu of corn.

On June 15th, Chen Yongyi, Secretary of the Xingtang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, convened a meeting in Qicun with eighty-six Communist Youth League members from five villages: Nan Jiasu, Nan Yangtong, Liushierzhuang, and Xiejiazhuang. At the meeting, Qian Wuzhong introduced his cooperative's method for eliminating corn borers, followed by a practical demonstration. The League members all learned the method and are now carrying out the work of eliminating corn borers in their respective villages.

    行唐县钱五中农业社消灭了玉米钻心虫
    河北省行唐县齐村钱五中农业生产合作社及时除治玉米钻心虫，带动了周围农民。
    钱五中农业生产合作社，今年种玉米一百三十亩，现在苗子已长到二尺多高，眼看就要吐穗，六月上旬忽然发现玉米苗上生了钻心虫。社里很快召集了五个生产队长和二十个青年团员开座谈会，由技术干部介绍了钻心虫的生活习性和生长规律，确定了防治办法，准备了百分之六的可湿性“六六六”药粉十四斤，每斤药对水四百斤到四百五十斤，进行防治。开始有的社员怕费了工夫治不死虫子，倒把玉米治坏了。生产队长傅志学带着五个小学生，把药水盛在水壶里和酒瓶里，酒瓶口上堵上碎秫秸，使药水慢慢流出，把药水灌到玉米的喇叭头内。这样治了八亩，第二天检查钻心虫都死了，玉米也没有受伤。接着就发动妇女和学生十八人，每人拿着一个酒瓶子，装上“六六六”药水，三天就消灭了九十六亩玉米的钻心虫。
    中共行唐县委书记陈永义在六月十五日，在齐村召开了南贾素、南羊同、六十二庄、解家庄等五个村的八十六个青年团员开会。会上，由钱五中介绍了他社除治玉米钻心虫的办法，会后，并作了实习。团员们都学会了这个方法，回去正开展消灭钻心虫工作。
