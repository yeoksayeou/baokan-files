    In the past six months, various machinery factories in Chengdu, Sichuan Province, have produced a large quantity of products to support basic construction across the country. These products include mine cars needed for the metallurgical industry, flat cars needed for the forestry industry, single-rail trolleys and cross-pointed shovels needed for railway and highway transportation, asphalt boilers, large asphalt rollers, water pipes needed for municipal construction, as well as bridge and roof iron components weighing over 100 tons, and woodworking machines needed for the construction industry—four-sided planers, wood lathes, etc. These products are being continuously sent to various basic construction units.
    This year, the state-owned Chengdu Machinery Factory in Sichuan Province, in addition to manufacturing a large number of boiler test pumps, sewer pipes, and over ninety other types of parts for more than fifty units such as the Central Ministry of Railways Materials Factory, has also manufactured a batch of woodworking machines for units such as the Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology and the Changsha Nonferrous Metals Industry School. These woodworking machines are highly efficient. One planer can plane 10,300 square meters of wood per day, equivalent to the workload of 1,200 manual laborers. The pound hammers and drill bits manufactured by more than twenty small and medium-sized iron factories in Chengdu for workers on the Kangzang and Cheng'a Highways, as well as the axes and mud shovels manufactured for loggers, are also being continuously sent to various construction sites.

    成都各机械厂生产大批产品支援各地建设
    半年来，四川省成都各机械厂生产了大批产品，支援各地基本建设。这些产品中，有矿冶工业需要的矿车，森林工业需要的平车，铁路、公路运输需要的单轨推车和十字锹，市政建设需要的沥青锅、沥青大滚、水管以及百吨以上的桥梁、房梁铁件，还有建筑业需要的木工机器——四面刨木机、木工车床等。这些产品正源源不断地送到各基本建设单位。
    今年，四川省国营成都机械厂除给中央铁道部材料厂等五十多个单位制造了大量的锅炉试泵、下水道水管等九十多种零件外，又给北京钢铁学院、长沙有色金属工业学校等单位制造了一批木工机器。这些木工机器的工作效率很高。一部刨木机每天能刨一万零三百平方公尺的木材，相当于一千二百个人工的工作量。成都市二十几家中、小型铁工厂为康藏、成阿公路的工人们制造的磅锤、炮钎，为伐木工人制造的斧头、泥铲等，也正源源不断地送往各工地。
