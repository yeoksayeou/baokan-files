The People's Liberation Army Encouraged by the Nation's Regards

    To Fulfill Their Oaths
    The People's Liberation Army units of the Central-South Military Region, after receiving the cordial regards of the people of the whole country, whether they are soldiers guarding factories and mines, sentries defending the borders, sailors patrolling the seas day and night, or troops undergoing formal training in the face of strong winds and scorching sun, all firmly remember Chairman Mao's and the nation's instructions to them, and more vigilantly hold fast to their posts, fulfilling their oaths to the motherland.
    The "Guohua Company" stationed on Hainan Island has recorded in detail in the company's history March 18th—the day the loved ones came to the company—and the words of the representatives, as a permanent memorial. The soldiers said: We will always remember this day and always advance under the encouragement of the people of the whole country.
    During training breaks, the soldiers of the "Tenacious Assault Company" took out the autograph books and photos given to them by their loved ones, looking at them again and again. They said, "This is the honor and strength the people of the motherland give us." On the day of live ammunition shooting, Qiu Peisui, a soldier in the fourth squad, had a problem with his right eye. He thought: What if I encounter this situation on the battlefield in the future? How can I strike the enemy! He insisted on using his left eye to aim and his left hand to pull the trigger, practicing repeatedly. As a result, he achieved a "good" result in this live ammunition shooting.
    After receiving the regards of their loved ones, the soldiers of the "Tashan Defense Hero Company" universally enhanced their sense of honor. In the days after their loved ones left, the soldiers shouted on the training ground from time to time: "We must repay the people of the motherland with the greatest achievements." In a recent live ammunition shooting, all ten machine gunners participating in the shooting achieved "excellent" results.
    The soldiers guarding the long coastline and borders of the motherland have become even more high-spirited in their fighting will after receiving the regards of the people of the motherland. They said: "Whether a bird flies from the sky or a blade of grass floats from the sea, we must look carefully. In order to defend the socialist construction of the motherland, we will never let go of an enemy, not even an enemy ship!"
    The soldiers of the Second Platoon of a certain company stationed on the forefront of the South China Sea held a solemn oath ceremony facing the ocean the day after saying goodbye to their loved ones, led by Squad Leader Dong Fengqi. They said: "We are the eyes of the motherland, carrying out the important task of guarding the safety of the motherland on the rough and stormy coastline. We must stick to our posts and regard hardship as glory." (Zhong Nanwen)

    Make the Liangshan Road a Reality
    "Our blood and sweat will wash away the suffering of the Yi people, and our hands will build a road to Liangshan," this is the solemn oath of the soldiers of the Leshan Military Subdistrict of the Sichuan Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army to the delegation of the National People's Regards to the People's Liberation Army. Now, they are working selflessly, enduring hardships, to fulfill their oath.
    They accepted the task of building the most difficult section of the Wuzhi Mountain as if they were accepting a combat mission. Before departure, the leaders lightened the load for the comrades' long march, but the soldiers' backpacks became heavier than before. Comrade Li Ronghua hid an axe in his backpack. He said: "I plan to use it to make tools, improve work efficiency, and build the road to Liangshan as soon as possible, to fulfill my guarantee to the regards delegation." Immediately afterwards, one axe after another, machetes, chisels... were all stuffed into the soldiers' backpacks. The soldiers all requested to bring tools to the construction site and resolutely stated that they would not fall behind.
    The five- to six-hundred-mile march has already been going on for the eleventh day. The road is blocked by towering mountains, and the troops are advancing on narrow paths overgrown with thorns and weeds. The wind blows hard, the rain falls incessantly, and the road is muddy. Even with straw sandals on, they slip and fall every few steps. But the soldiers did not have the slightest fear. They finally arrived at Wuzhi Mountain, a sparsely populated and desolate place.
    Wuzhi Mountain, which is nearly 3,000 meters above sea level and is shrouded in rain and fog all year round, has unpredictable weather. Sometimes, wearing a single layer of clothing makes you sweat, and sometimes, wearing a cotton coat is cold when it rains heavily. The soil of Wuzhi Mountain is mostly yellow clay, which is sticky and impermeable. The soldiers often work in heavy fog in strong winds and rain, in mud more than a foot deep. During the construction, a patriotic labor competition and an engineering creation movement were launched, and various tools suitable for the rainy, wet, and muddy conditions of Wuzhi Mountain were created, replacing heavy physical labor such as carrying on shoulders and hands. Every creation by the soldiers went through a very difficult process. When soldier Tang Mandang initially discovered that his work efficiency was less than one standard work hour per day, he was so worried that he could not sleep for several nights. He thought: "How can I complete the task to answer the regards delegation?" After thinking hard day and night, he finally rushed to make the first "mud sled" overnight, increasing work efficiency by two times. Youth League member Mao Guozhang often said: "Resolutely strive to make meritorious service in road construction and fulfill the guarantee to the regards delegation." Under his hard work, a wooden "earth bucket cart" slides back and forth on a fifty-meter-long wooden track to discharge earth, increasing work efficiency by two times. Immediately afterwards, earth trains, automatic tipping carts... all appeared on the construction site.
    The road construction project on Wuzhi Mountain is particularly arduous. The soldiers have to open up a road on the cliffs and precipices as high as more than 300 meters. The hard stone quality makes sparks fly with every hammer blow, and more than a dozen steel chisels have to be broken for every ten centimeters of blasting hole. Zhang Zilu, a first-class meritorious worker and a soldier of the Ninth Squad of the Eleventh Company, who is responsible for splitting the Guanshan Gate stone, said: "When I encounter difficulties, thinking of the regards delegation gives me great strength, and I don't feel tired even if I work all day." The ladder-shaped stone control and group blasting he created increased work efficiency by more than three times. Soldier Zhong Jianyou said: "Seeing the banner of the regards delegation makes me full of energy. Even the biggest stone has to be pried down." He repeatedly requested to continue working even when he was sick. Only two months after the start of construction, a two-meter-wide roadbed has appeared on the steep wall of Guanshan Gate. The soldiers are building a road to happiness for the Yi people with their brave and diligent hands, to fulfill their oath to the people of the whole country.

    Meeting Loved Ones on the Observation Deck
    I had been looking forward to loved ones for a long time, preparing to welcome them, and preparing a gift for them. But unfortunately, the day the loved ones arrived was my turn to stand guard.
    My post is not on the deck, nor next to the bridge, but on that observation deck halfway up. This place is high and narrow. To get up from the cabin, you have to climb five vertical ladders. Comrades on the ship rarely come to this high place, except for me, the sentry on duty.
    At noon this day, the warship set sail. I looked around with binoculars on the observation deck, feeling happy and anxious at the same time! I was happy that I had done my part to protect the safety of the loved ones on the ship; but whenever I looked down and saw the enthusiasm of the loved ones and comrades, I felt anxious! I cannot personally give the gift to my loved ones, cannot shake hands with them, talk to them, and cannot ask them to greet Chairman Mao on my behalf. What a pity!
    But I can't go down. I am the sentry on the observation deck. Thinking of this, I raised my head again and raised the binoculars in my hand.
    The sky was drizzling, and the warship was sailing through the waves on the sea. The applause and singing on the deck became more and more cheerful! The loved ones sang wonderful songs for our sailors on the ship, and the sailors also performed interesting dances for them. The ship was filled with happy laughter everywhere. At this time, I, guarding the high observation deck, could not help but share this joy of a family reunion, and did not feel cold at all from the oncoming cold wind and rain.
    "Thank you for your hard work, dear maritime sentry comrade!"
    I turned around, and a strong hand stretched over from the rangefinder! Ah, our loved ones actually climbed over five vertical ladders and came to the observation deck to comfort me, the sentry on duty. I hurriedly greeted them with both hands. The loved one's kind face was full of smiles, and his eyes were shining with gentle light. This unexpected meeting left me speechless for a while, only holding his powerful hand tightly. After a long time, I said: "Hello, comrade!" At that time, I really wanted to climb over the rangefinder and hug my loved one.
    I suddenly remembered something and hurriedly took out the brand-new floral towel from my pocket. This was a gift from the people when our warship participated in grain transportation and disaster relief last year. It has been almost a year and I have been keeping it, reluctant to use it. Today, I will pass it on to the representative comrade to express a little of my appreciation!
    Before leaving, the loved one shook my hand and said, "I wish you good health!"
    I said, "Please greet Chairman Mao on my behalf, and wish Chairman Mao eternal health!"

    全国人民的慰问鼓舞着人民解放军
    为了实现自己的誓言
    中国人民解放军中南军区部队，经过全国人民亲切的慰问以后，无论是警卫着工厂矿山的战士，还是守卫在边防上的哨兵，无论是日夜在海上巡逻的水兵，或是冒着狂风烈日进行正规训练的部队，都牢牢记着毛主席和全国人民的对自己的嘱咐，更加警惕地坚守在自己的岗位上，履行着自己对祖国的誓言。
    驻守在海南岛的某部“国华连”，把三月十八日——亲人们来到连里的日子，和代表们讲的话，详尽地记载在连队的历史上，作为永远的纪念。战士们说：我们永远记住这个日子，永远在全国人民的鼓舞下前进。
    “顽强冲杀连”的战士们，在训练中的休息时间，拿出亲人给他们的签字本和照片看了又看，他们说：“这是祖国人民给我们的荣誉和力量。”实弹射击那天，四班战士邱佩绥的右眼有了毛病，他想：万一将来在战场上碰到这种情况，怎样打击敌人呢！他坚持着用左眼瞄准，用左手扣扳机，反复地练了又练，结果，在这次实弹射击中，他得到了“良好”的成绩。
    “塔山守备英雄连”的战士们，接受了亲人慰问以后，普遍提高了荣誉感，在亲人走后的这些日子里，战士们在教练场上不时地喊着：“要以最大的成绩答谢祖国人民。”在最近的一次实弹射击中，参加射击的十名机枪射手，全都获得了“优秀”成绩。
    守卫在祖国漫长的海防和边防线上的战士们，接受祖国人民慰问以后，斗争意志更加高昂。他们说：“不管从空中飞过一只鸟，从海上飘过一棵草，我们都要看个仔细，为了保卫祖国的社会主义建设，绝不放过一个敌人，一只敌舰！”
    驻守在南海最前哨的某连二班战士们，在送别亲人的第二天，班长董凤岐带领全班面向海洋举行了庄严的宣誓。他们说：“我们是祖国的眼睛，在狂风怒浪的海防线上执行着警卫祖国安全的重大任务，我们一定坚守岗位，把艰苦当作光荣。”（锺南文）
    要使公路上凉山
    “我们的血汗洗净彝胞的苦难，我们的双手把公路修到凉山”，这是中国人民解放军四川乐山军分区的战士们对全国人民慰问人民解放军代表团的庄严誓言。现在，他们正忘我地劳动着，忍受着艰苦，来履行自己的誓言。
    他们像接受战斗任务一样接受了修建最艰巨的五指山的工段。出发前领导上为了照顾同志们的长途行军，进行轻装。但战士们的背包反而比原来加重了。李荣华同志的背包里藏着一把斧头，他说：“我准备用它来制造工具，提高工效，早日把公路修到凉山，实现我对慰问团的保证。”紧接着，一把又一把的斧头，砍刀，凿子……都打进了战士们的背包。战士们都请求把工具带到工地，并坚决表示不掉队。
    五、六百里的徒步行军，已经是第十一天，道路被崇山峻岭阻隔着，部队在长满荆棘野草的小径上前进。风一股劲地刮，雨不住地下，路上泥泞不堪，穿上“脚马”也走几步滑一跤。但战士们没有丝毫畏惧，他们终于来到人烟稀少，遍地荒凉的五指山。
    终年弥漫着雨雾拔海近三千公尺的五指山，气候变化无常，有时穿一件单衣还汗流浃背，时而下起倾盆大雨，穿上棉衣也冷。五指山的泥土多是富有粘性不透水的黄粘泥。战士们经常冒着狂风暴雨在大雾中与一尺多深的稀泥中劳动。施工中展开了爱国主义劳动竞赛和工程创造运动，一件件适合五指山雨多地湿泥粘的各种工具创造出来了，代替了笨重的肩挑手提等体力劳动。战士们每一创造都经过了非常艰辛的过程。战士唐满当他最初发现一天工效还不到一个标准工时，愁得几晚上睡不好，他想：“这样怎能完成任务来回答慰问团呢？”经他日夜苦思，终于连夜赶制出第一个“滑泥船”，提高工效两倍。青年团员毛国章经常这样说：“坚决争取在筑路中立功，实现对慰问团的保证。”在他辛勤的努力下，一架木制的“土斗车”在五十公尺长的木轨上来回滑动排土，提高工效两倍。紧接着，土火车、自动倒土车……都在工地上出现了。
    五指山的筑路工程特别艰巨，战士们要在这高达三百多公尺的悬崖绝壁间开辟出一条公路来。坚硬的石质，每打一锤火星四溅，打十公分炮眼便要打坏十多根钢钎，担负劈开关门石的一等功臣、十一连九班战士张子禄说：“遇到困难，想起慰问团劲就大啦，整天劳动也不觉得累。”他创造的梯字形控石与放集团炮，提高工效三倍多。战士锺建友说：“看到慰问团的锦旗就浑身是劲，再大的石头也要撬下去。”他病了也再三请求坚持工作。开工才两个月，关门石的陡壁上已出现了两公尺宽的路基。战士们正以勇敢勤劳的双手修筑一条给彝族人民通到幸福的公路，来实现他们对于全国人民的誓言。

    瞭望台上会亲人
    我很早就在盼望着亲人，准备迎接亲人，为亲人预备了一份礼物。可是偏不凑巧，亲人来到的这天，正轮到我值更。
    我的更位不在甲板上，也不在驾驶台旁，而是在那半天高的瞭望台上。这地方又高又窄，从舱面上来，得爬五道竖梯，舰上的同志平时也很少上这高头来，除非是我这值更的哨兵。
    这天中午，军舰开航了，我在瞭望台上拿望远镜四处瞭望，心里又高兴又着急！高兴的是为了保护亲人在舰上的安全，我尽了一分力量；可是每当低头一看，见到亲人和同志们的那股亲热劲，我心里就急得慌！我不能亲手把礼物送给亲人，不能跟亲人握握手，谈谈心，不能请亲人代问毛主席好，这是多遗憾的事啊！
    可是，我不能下去，我是瞭望台上的哨兵。一想到这，我又抬起头来，举起手里的望远镜。
    天空飘着雨丝，军舰在大海上破浪疾驶。甲板上的掌声和歌声越来越欢！亲人为我们舰上水兵演唱了精彩的歌曲，水兵们也为亲人表演了有趣的舞蹈。舰上到处洋溢着欢乐的谈笑声。这时，我守在高高的瞭望台上，也不禁分享这种仿佛家人团聚的快乐，对迎面扑来的寒风和冷雨，一点也不感到寒冷。
    “辛苦了，亲爱的海上哨兵同志！”
    我一转身，一只粗壮的手打测距仪那边伸过来了！啊，我们的亲人竟爬过五道竖梯，亲自来到瞭望台上来慰问我这值更的哨兵来了。我双手急忙迎上。亲人慈祥的脸上充满笑容，眼里闪着柔和的目光。这意外的会见使我一时说不上话来，只有紧紧握着他那只有力的手。好半天，我才说：“您好啊，同志！”当时，我真想从测距仪上爬过去，和亲人拥抱在一起。　　我忽然想起一件事，忙从裤袋里掏出那条崭新的花毛巾来。这是去年我们的军舰参加运粮救灾时，人民送的礼物，已经快一年了，一直保存着，舍不得用。今天，就把它转送给代表同志，表示一点心意吧！
    亲人临走前，握住我的手说：“祝您身体健康！”
    我说：“请您代问毛主席好，祝毛主席身体永远健康！”
