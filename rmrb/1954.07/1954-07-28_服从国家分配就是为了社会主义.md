Dear young students and Youth League members applying to universities!

Some of you are this year's high school graduates, some are graduates of worker-peasant rapid middle schools and secondary vocational schools, some are cadres from government offices, and some are young people from all walks of life. To prepare to participate in the construction of the motherland, you have all applied to universities. This year, universities are enrolling more than 90,000 students, an increase of nearly 20,000 from last year. The number of college students is increasing year by year, and young workers and peasants who previously had no opportunity to study can now also go to university. This is a new phenomenon in New China, something that never happened in Old China. What does this show? It shows that our country is thriving, large-scale economic construction has begun, and the country needs more and more cadres. At the same time, it also shows the special care the country has for young people. To be able to study in preparation for participating in the construction of the motherland in such an era is your great happiness. Therefore, first of all, I would like to extend my warm congratulations to you on behalf of the Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League!

To ensure the completion of the enrollment plan, this year the national universities still adopt a unified enrollment method. Enrollment work has improved year by year. Taking the admission and allocation of new students as an example, in the past, it was generally done according to the needs of the country, taking into account the wishes of the applying students. This year, more detailed regulations have been made in this regard. On the other hand, after studying the general line, the socialist consciousness of the broad masses of young people has been raised, and the students applying to universities are generally able to choose their application preferences more realistically based on national needs and their own conditions. Therefore, we believe that this year's enrollment work will be done better than last year. However, judging from the current application situation in various places, the departments and majors that students apply for are still too concentrated. Most students are applying for engineering, exceeding the number required by the plan, while the various majors of normal, geology, mining, Russian, political science, law, and sports colleges and schools, which have relatively heavy enrollment tasks this year, have very few applicants. This means that there is still a certain distance between the students' application preferences and the needs of the country. When the admission and allocation are made in the future, some students will not be able to enter school according to their application preferences.

Now that the exams have been taken, you may already be considering this question: what should you do if the department or major to which you are admitted does not match your application preference?

Some students say: "Whatever the motherland needs me to study, I will study." "The needs of the motherland are my wishes." This attitude of first considering the needs of the motherland and proceeding from the needs of the motherland is completely correct. Of course, this does not mean that young people should not have wishes. When applying, we should hold this attitude and combine it with our personal conditions to choose our further education preferences. After the results are announced, if the admitted department or major does not match our application preference, we should even more consciously accept the allocation with this attitude. We believe that most students will do this.

However, some students may still not be able to figure out this question. Why can't they figure it out? Because they do not have a clear understanding of some issues, mainly the lack of a comprehensive understanding of the needs of the national construction cause, and they do not have a clear understanding of what is called key construction and what is called non-key construction. They believe that only the key is important, and the non-key is not important. So they think that only certain departments and majors are important, and applying to these departments and majors will be "promising," "have a future," and be "glorious" in the future, while other departments and majors are not important, have no future, and are not glorious, so they are unwilling to study them.

Comrades, these views are wrong, and the facts are not like this. As everyone knows, our country is building socialism. Building socialism is not a simple matter. In the first five-year plan, we must not only concentrate our main efforts on developing heavy industry, but also correspondingly develop agriculture, light industry, transportation, and commerce, and also correspondingly train construction talents. Of course, developing industry is the center and the key, but this does not mean that everything else is not important except for developing industry. All these tasks are important and indispensable. Without any aspect, socialism cannot be built. The so-called key and non-key are merely differences in the order of priority in a certain period. Similarly, the construction talents needed by the country are also multifaceted, not only needing construction talents in the industrial field, but also needing construction talents in other fields. The same is true for the students themselves. All roads lead to socialism, and whatever you study is for the construction of socialism and can contribute your strength to socialism. In the Soviet Union, everyone, whether they are engineers, teachers, farmers, or elevator operators or floor cleaners, regards their labor as indispensable to the socialist motherland. They all love their work and are full of proud feelings for their work. Some of our students lack this kind of feeling. For example, some students are unwilling to study political science and law, thinking that political and legal work is just "judging cases all day long, and contacting nothing but petty people who are meticulous about everything." Of course, most of our students have a correct understanding of the major they are studying. For example, two students from the Law Department of Renmin University of China have this understanding of their major. They said: "When we solve cases of private industrial and commercial enterprises cutting corners and ensure the smooth development of national economic construction, we feel that we are not only builders of revolutionary rule of law, but also engineers of building a new society. Our sweat is also like dripping into the molten iron furnace of Anshan Iron and Steel and the oil wells of Xinjiang." I think this understanding is very correct. It is precisely because they have such a correct understanding of the role and significance of political and legal work in socialist construction that they can love the major they are studying. If every student can think like this and see the problem like this, then the so-called "whether there is a future," "whether there is a future," "whether it is glorious," etc., will no longer exist.

What is called "promising," "having a future," and what is called "glorious"? There are two views and two perspectives on this issue. One is the view of bourgeois individualism. According to this view, anything that makes a lot of money, enjoys a good life, has a "big name," and is "popular" is the most "promising," the most "promising," and the most "glorious." The other view is the view of the working class collectivism. According to this view, the most promising, the most promising, and the most glorious thing is to serve the people, to serve the people diligently. Comrades, what view should we use to look at this issue? There is no doubt that we should despise the bourgeois individualistic view and should use the view of the working class to look at this issue. What is the purpose of our study? It is to labor better for the motherland and for socialism. Chief Commander Zhu congratulated the youth of the country at the 35th anniversary of the May Fourth Movement, saying: All ambitious young people should "be good at combining great ideals with specific daily work, and regard ordinary labor as the glorious cause of building a great motherland." This means that all labor is glorious, and all work needed by the country and the people is equally valued by the Party and the People's Government. As long as you have the spirit of diligently serving the people, you can give full play to your wisdom and talents in any work, make beautiful achievements, and become a "person who is beneficial to the people" as Chairman Mao said. Like Wu Yunduo, who dedicated everything to the Party, like Wang Chonglun, who ran ahead of time, and thousands upon thousands of people we don't know, who work hard and bury their heads in their respective jobs, "have a point of heat, emit a point of light," and contribute all their strength to the motherland, they are all such people. We should learn from such people, and first of all we should learn their spirit of diligently serving the people.

Some students are unwilling to study at normal schools, saying that they are afraid of being looked down upon and "not glorious." Being a people's teacher and educating and cultivating the next generation for the motherland, what is "not glorious" about this? Young people should dare to adhere to the truth. As long as what I do is right, what am I afraid of what others say? You say that being a teacher is "not glorious" and look down on me, but the people will look up to me, and I am very glorious in front of the people. Despising teachers and despising teacher work is an extremely wrong and harmful view left over from the old society. Young people should not be affected by this view, and should further use their own practical actions to overcome this view and promote correct views, so that they can gradually establish a correct public opinion and atmosphere of respecting teachers and respecting teacher work.

Some students are unwilling to study geology, saying that geological work is too hard. Are young people in the Mao Zedong era still afraid of hardship? Socialism is built from hard work and overcoming difficulties. Soviet youth responded to the call of the Party and the government to reclaim wasteland and proposed: "Never look for easy work!" What a heroic spirit! A middle school student in Shanghai chose geology as his first choice for college entrance examination. He said:

"Yes, this is indeed the most difficult job, which requires going to uninhabited places, climbing high mountains, and eating coarse grains, but I think, if there is such a day when I first excavate an underground treasure, when I think of adding a stroke of color to the beautiful map of the motherland because of my labor, how happy should I be!" The youths who are exploring Daye often work in the wilderness in the wind and rain and under the scorching sun, day and night, but they are full of joy and pride, singing such songs: "It is the wind of the valley that blows our red flag; it is the raging rain that washes our tents. We have flame-like enthusiasm, overcoming all fatigue and cold. Carrying our luggage on our backs, climbing the layers of peaks, we are full of infinite hope, looking for rich mineral deposits for the motherland." You see, this is the attitude of ambitious young people towards hardship and difficulty. They regard it as their greatest happiness and happiness to engage in hard work for the motherland and to overcome all difficulties.

Some students may also think this way: Since every major is needed by the motherland, why can't I be admitted according to my preference? Comrades, the country trains construction talents in a planned and proportional manner. In the entire enrollment plan, it is not okay for too many students in some departments and it is not okay for too few students in some departments. The needs of the motherland are specific. If too many students apply for engineering and too few students apply for normal, geology, political science and law, etc., then completing the enrollment plans for these departments is the most urgent need of the country at present. Today, applying to universities to study in which department is not a personal matter, but is related to the country's construction plan. The failure to complete this year's university enrollment plan will directly affect the task of training cadres within the first five-year plan, which will also affect the entire national economic construction plan. Can the country build a few more factories in order to take care of the students who apply for engineering, or build fewer schools because fewer people apply for normal schools? Of course not. Therefore, when the needs of the country and personal preferences are inconsistent, students should consciously obey the needs of the country. Some students overemphasize personal preferences and interests, and fix and absolutize preferences and interests, thinking that they cannot be changed. However, we know that for a high school graduate, interests and hobbies are in the process of being formed, and they are not unchangeable. Interest and hobby in any major can be cultivated in study and work.

Dear students and Youth League members! The phrase "Everything for socialism" has become our common slogan for young people. Realizing socialism is the common goal of struggle for the people and youth of the country, and it is also the greatest interest of the people and youth of the country. Socialism means the prosperity and strength of our country, and it means that our lives are becoming more and more beautiful and happy. However, socialism also means hard work, overcoming difficulties, and obeying the national plan. "Everything for socialism" is not empty talk, it is our program of action. For you - the young people and Youth League members who apply to universities, consciously obeying the needs of the country, happily accepting the admission and allocation after the results are announced, and going to study at the posts needed by the motherland, this is for socialism, this is a concrete manifestation of patriotism. Chinese students have a glorious patriotic tradition. They have always responded positively to the call of the motherland. They are worthy of being good sons and daughters of the motherland. I believe that you will never lag behind in this regard. You will definitely answer your beloved motherland with such a loud slogan: "For socialism, go to where the motherland needs me!"

    服从国家分配就是为了社会主义
    中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会书记处书记  罗毅亲爱的投考高等学校的青年同学们，青年团员们！
    你们当中有的是今年的高中毕业生，有的是工农速成中学和中等专业学校的毕业生，有的是机关干部，有的是社会各界青年。为了准备参加祖国的建设，你们都投考了高等学校。今年高等学校招生九万多人，比去年增加了将近两万人。大学生一年比一年增加，过去没有机会念书的工农青年，现在也能上大学了。这是新中国的新气象，旧中国从来没有过这样的事情。这说明了什么呢？这说明了我们的国家蒸蒸日上，大规模的经济建设开始了，国家需要的干部越来越多了。同时，这也说明了国家对青年的特别关怀。生长在这样的时代，能够为了准备参加祖国建设而学习，是你们的莫大幸福。因此，首先我要代表中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会向你们表示热烈的祝贺！
    为了保证招生计划的完成，今年全国高等学校仍旧采取统一招生的办法。招生工作一年比一年有了改进，拿新生的录取分配来说，过去一般都做到了按照国家需要，适当照顾到投考同学的志愿来进行分配。今年在这方面做了更加细致的规定。另一方面，经过总路线学习以后，广大青年的社会主义觉悟提高了，投考高等学校的同学，一般都能够根据国家需要，结合个人条件，比较实事求是地选择自己的报考志愿。因此，我们相信，今年的招生工作会比去年做得更好。但是，从目前各地报考的情况来看，同学们报考的系科还是太集中。大多数同学都报考工科，超过计划所需要的数字，而今年招生任务比较重的师范以及地质、矿业、俄文、政法、体育等院、校的各个专业，报考的人却很少。这就是说，同学们的报考志愿和国家的需要之间，还存在着一定的距离。将来录取分配时，就要有一部分同学不能按照自己的报考志愿入学。
    现在，考试已经考过了，你们也许已经在考虑这个问题，就是：如果录取分配的系科不符合自己的报考志愿，怎么办呢？
    有些同学说：“祖国需要我学什么，我就学什么。”“祖国的需要就是我的志愿。”这种首先考虑到祖国的需要、从祖国的需要出发的态度，是完全正确的。当然，并不是说青年不应当有志愿。在报考的时候，我们正是应当抱着上面这种态度，结合个人条件来选择升学志愿。在发榜以后，如果录取的系科不符合自己的报考志愿，我们就更应当抱着这种态度来自觉地接受分配。我们相信，大多数同学都会这样做的。
    但是，可能有些同学对这个问题还想不通。为什么想不通呢？因为他们对有些问题还认识得不清楚，主要是对于国家建设事业的需要缺乏全面的了解，对于什么叫重点建设，什么叫非重点建设认识得不清楚。他们认为，只有重点才是重要的，不是重点就不重要。于是就认为，只有某些系科才是重要的，报考这些系科将来才“有出息”、“有前途”，才“光荣”，而其他的系科就不重要，就没出息、没前途、不光荣，因而不愿去学。
    同学们，这些看法是不对的，事实并不如此。大家都知道，我们国家正在建设社会主义。建设社会主义不是一件简单的事情。在第一个五年计划中，我们不但要集中主要力量发展重工业，而且要相应地发展农业、轻工业、交通运输业和商业，还要相应地培养建设人材。当然，发展工业是中心、是重点，但是，并不是说除了发展工业以外，其他一切工作都不重要了。所有这些工作都是重要的，都是不可缺少的，无论缺少了哪一方面，社会主义都是建设不起来的。所谓重点和非重点，仅仅是在一定时期的先后缓急的区别。同样地，国家所需要的建设人材也是多方面的，不仅需要工业方面的建设人材，同样也需要其他方面的建设人材。对同学们自己来说，也是这样。条条道路通向社会主义，无论学什么，都是为了建设社会主义，都能为社会主义贡献自己的力量。在苏联，每一个人，不管是工程师、教员、种地的，或是开电梯、擦地板的，他们都把自己的劳动看作社会主义祖国所不可缺少的，他们都热爱自己的工作，对自己的工作充满了自豪的感情。我们有些同学却缺乏这种感情。例如，有的同学不愿学政法，认为政法工作只是“整天判案，接触的尽是斤斤计较的小人”。当然，我们大多数同学对自己所学的专业是有正确认识的。例如，中国人民大学法律系有两个同学就是这样认识他们所学的专业的，他们说：“当我们解决了私营工商业偷工减料的案件，保证了国家经济建设顺利发展的时候，我们感到我们不仅是革命法制的建设者，同时也是建设新社会的工程师。我们的汗珠也像是滴在鞍钢的熔铁炉和新疆的石油井中一样。”我看这样的认识就是很正确的。正是由于他们对政法工作在社会主义建设中的作用和意义有了这样正确的认识，所以他们能够热爱自己所学的专业。如果每一个同学都能这样想，都能这样看问题，那么，所谓“有无出息”、“有无前途”、“是否光荣”等等问题，也就不存在了。
    什么叫做“有出息”、“有前途”，什么叫做“光荣”呢？在这个问题上有两种看法，两种观点。一种是资产阶级个人主义的观点，按照这种观点，凡是赚钱多、享受好、“名气大”、“吃得开”的事情，就是最有“出息”、最有“前途”、最“光荣”的事情。另外一种观点，是工人阶级集体主义的观点，按照这种观点，最有出息、最有前途、最光荣的事情，就是为人民服务，勤勤恳恳地为人民服务。同学们，我们应当用什么观点来看待这个问题呢？毫无疑问，我们应当鄙视那种资产阶级个人主义的观点，应当用工人阶级的观点来看这个问题。我们学习的目的是什么呢？就是为祖国、为社会主义更好地劳动。朱总司令在“五四”三十五周年纪念大会上向全国青年祝贺时曾经说：一切有志的青年，都应当“善于将伟大的理想和日常的具体的工作结合起来，把平凡的劳动看做是建设伟大祖国的光荣事业”。这就是说，一切劳动都是光荣的，凡是国家和人民所需要的工作，都是同样受到党和人民政府的重视的，只要你具有勤勤恳恳地为人民服务的精神，在任何工作中，都能够发挥自己的智慧和才能，做出漂亮的成绩来，成为毛主席所说的“有益于人民的人”。像把一切献给党的吴运铎，像跑在时间前面的王崇伦，以及千千万万我们所不知道的、在各个不同的工作岗位上辛勤劳动、埋头苦干、“有一分热，发一分光”、为祖国贡献出自己一切力量的人们，他们都是这样的人。我们应当向这样的人学习，首先要学习他们勤勤恳恳为人民服务的精神。
    有些同学不愿学师范，说是怕人看不起，“不光彩”。做一个人民教师，为祖国教育、培养下一代，这有什么“不光彩”的呢？青年人应当敢于坚持真理，只要我做的事情是对的，别人怎么讲我怕什么？你说做教师“不光彩”，看不起我，但是人民会看得起我，我在人民面前很有光彩。轻视教师、轻视教师工作，这是旧社会遗留下来的极端错误有害的观点，青年人应当不受这种观点的影响，并且要进一步用自己的实际行动去克服这种观点，去宣传正确的观点，这样，才能够逐渐地树立起尊敬教师、尊重教师工作的正确的舆论和风气。
  有些同学不愿学地质，说地质工作太艰苦。毛泽东时代的青年，还害怕艰苦吗？社会主义就是从艰苦奋斗，克服困难中建设起来的。苏联青年响应党和政府开垦荒地的号召，提出了：“决不找轻松的活”！这是多么英勇的气概！上海有一个中学生，选择了地质作为他考大学的第一志愿，他说：
  “是的，这的确是最艰苦的工作，这要到荒无人烟的地方去，爬高山、吃粗粮，但是我想，要是有这么一天当我第一次发掘了一种地下宝藏，想到因自己的劳动为祖国美丽的地图添了一笔颜色的时候，我的心情该要多么的快乐！”勘探大冶的青年们，他们经常冒着风雨和烈日，不分白天和黑夜地在荒野里工作，但是他们却充满愉快和自豪的感情，唱着这样的歌：“是那山谷的风，吹动了我们的红旗；是那狂暴的雨，洗刷了我们的篷帐。我们有火焰般的热情，战胜了一切疲劳和寒冷。背上我们的行装，攀上层层的山峰，我们满怀无限的希望，为祖国寻找丰富的矿藏。”你们看，这就是有志气的青年对待艰苦困难的态度。他们是把为祖国去从事艰苦的工作，去战胜一切困难，当作自己最大的快乐和幸福的。
    还有一些同学可能会这样想：既然每个专业都是祖国所需要的，为什么不可以按照我的志愿录取呢？同学们，国家培养建设人材是有计划按比例的，在整个招生计划里，哪些系科的学生太多了不行，哪些系科的学生太少了也不行。祖国的需要是具体的，如果报考工科的学生太多，而报考师范、地质、政法等系科的学生太少，那么，完成这些系科的招生计划，就是国家当前最迫切的需要。今天，投考高等学校入什么系科学习，这都不是什么个人的事情，而是关系着国家的建设计划的。今年的高等学校招生计划不能完成，就会直接影响到第一个五年计划内培养干部的任务，也就会影响整个国家经济建设的计划。难道国家能够为了照顾报考工科的同学多，就多办几个工厂，或者因为报考师范的人少，就少办一些学校吗？当然是不能够的。因此，当国家需要和个人志愿不一致的时候，同学们就应当自觉地服从国家的需要。有的同学过分强调了个人的志愿和兴趣，把志愿、兴趣固定和绝对化了，认为不能改变。但是，我们知道，对一个中学毕业生来说，兴趣和爱好都正在形成的过程中，并不是不可以改变的。对任何专业的兴趣和爱好，都是可以在学习和工作中培养起来的。
    亲爱的同学们，青年团员们！“一切为着社会主义”这句话，已经成了我们青年们的共同口号。实现社会主义是我们全国人民和青年共同的奋斗目标，也是全国人民和青年的最大利益。社会主义就是意味着我们国家的繁荣富强，意味着我们的生活日益美好幸福。但是，社会主义同时也是意味着艰苦奋斗、克服困难，意味着要服从国家计划。“一切为着社会主义”不是一句空话，它是我们的行动纲领。对于你们——投考高等学校的青年和青年团员们来说，自觉地服从国家的需要，在发榜以后愉快地接受录取分配，到祖国所需要的岗位上去学习，这就是为了社会主义，这就是爱国主义的具体表现。中国的青年学生有着光荣的爱国主义传统，他们对于祖国的召唤从来都是积极响应的，他们不愧是祖国的好儿女。我相信，在这一点上你们也决不会落后的。你们一定会用这样响亮的口号来回答自己亲爱的祖国：“为了社会主义，到祖国需要我的地方去！”（新华社）
