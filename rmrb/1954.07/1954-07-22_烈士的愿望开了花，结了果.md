    Recently, I interviewed Chen Guizhen, the widow of "February 7th" martyr Lin Xiangqian, and asked her about her thoughts on the draft constitution.
    Chen Guizhen was very excited at the beginning. She said, "How can I explain it? The first article of the draft constitution clearly states that our country is led by the working class, and it also stipulates that the working people have many rights. I really don't know how to explain it." She pondered for a while, and then slowly said: "Since the draft constitution was published, I often think of some things before and after Xiangqian's sacrifice. Thirty-one years have passed, and the freedom and human rights that Xiangqian shed blood and sacrificed for back then are now written in the draft constitution. His blood was not shed in vain, and Xiangqian's wish has finally blossomed and borne fruit. I have finally waited for this day and witnessed the days that Xiangqian had hoped for. Comrade, I want to tell you in detail: how Xiangqian sacrificed, and how we have lived these years."
    Chen Guizhen remembers very clearly. She said: "On February 7, 1923, at noon on the day of the incident, Xiangqian returned from the trade union. At that time, he was the chairman of the Jiang'an branch of the Beijing-Hankou Railway General Trade Union. I asked him: 'What's been happening these days? You don't care about anything at home, you've become so thin.' Xiangqian paused for a while and replied: 'We are on strike, fighting for freedom, fighting for human rights, and seeking happiness for the workers!' At that time, I was a housewife, and I knew very little except for my husband, children, cooking, and mending socks. I asked him what he meant by 'seeking happiness for the workers?' Xiangqian stroked his four-year-old daughter, Hanyu, and said: 'Hanyu will be happy when she grows up.' After he finished speaking, he left in a hurry. The situation outside was very tense at that time. In the evening, it became even worse outside. A worker came to inform me that Xiangqian had been arrested. I rushed to Jiang'an Station and saw Xiangqian and many workers tied to telephone poles. I desperately squeezed in front of Xiangqian, crying and shouting. But Xiangqian comforted me and said: 'Don't cry. If I die, you must take good care of Hanyu. No matter if the child you raise is a boy or a girl, you must raise them….' Before her husband could finish speaking, the warlord's lackeys beat me back with gun butts. I was already three or four months pregnant at that time." Chen Guizhen's eyes were filled with tears as she spoke, and her voice was hoarse. She paused for a moment and continued: "Soon, the workers came to tell me that Xiangqian had sacrificed. The workers said that Xiangqian died heroically. He was tied to a telephone pole at the station, and Zhang Housheng, a minion of the warlord Wu Peifu, personally forced Xiangqian to issue an order to resume work. Xiangqian refused. Zhang Housheng ordered the executioner to cut him with a knife and asked: 'Will you issue the order to resume work?' Xiangqian shouted: 'Without the order of the General Trade Union, I can lose my head, but I will not resume work!' Zhang Housheng ordered another cut. Xiangqian endured the pain and cursed: 'What is there to say now? A good China is being ruined by you damned warlords...' Zhang was even more furious when he heard this, and cut him again. Xiangqian sacrificed in this way. Among the workers who sacrificed on this day was also Xiangqian's younger brother, Lin Yuancheng. Their two bodies were placed in my dilapidated house. I guarded them and cried for a long time. Later, I stopped crying. They died, but I couldn't die. I wanted to live on and see how these damned bastards would end up, and I also wanted to see what kind of happiness Xiangqian was talking about."
    Chen Guizhen continued, "The next day, others told me that the warlord Wu Peifu's newspaper said that Lin Xiangqian was a Communist Party member, so he had to be killed. That was the first time I had heard of the Communist Party. Xiangqian had never told me about it. I thought: Xiangqian is a good person, and the Communist Party must also be good people. They are probably the kind of people who want to seek happiness for the workers, just like Xiangqian said. I was not wrong. Facts have proved that the Communist Party is indeed like that."
    Chen Guizhen continued to recall the painful past: "Then again, I was really having a run of bad luck at that time. Ever since the warlords killed his two sons, Xiangqian's father had been acting crazy. One day, he was working in the boiler room, and because he was working a little slowly, a scab ran over and scolded him: 'Your two sons are bandits, it's already cheap for you to be able to work on the railway. You still don't work hard, you deserve to die!' Xiangqian's father retorted, and the scab kicked him in the lower abdomen. The old man couldn't withstand the blow and died soon after. I couldn't stay in Hankou any longer. This lonely and helpless woman accompanied three coffins back to Shanggan Town. The workers and the underground organization of the Communist Party raised some money for me. At that time, there were only three people in the family: me, Hanyu, and Guankang, a baby boy born six months after Xiangqian's death."
    Chen Guizhen mentioned her daughter Hanyu in her speech. She said:
  "Xiangqian loved this child very much. Soon after Xiangqian died, the warlords sent reactionary troops to my house to search. They rummaged through boxes and cabinets, taking away any piece of paper with writing on it. At that time, the trade union's stamp was still in a piece of clothing that Xiangqian had not worn. Hanyu was young, and the reactionary troops didn't pay much attention to her. She secretly hid the stamp. Later, the workers praised her and asked her why she did this. She said: 'My father's things cannot be taken away by bad people!' A four-year-old child already knew who the enemy was." At this point, Chen Guizhen pointed to a photo hanging in a frame for the reporter to see. The photo was of a little girl with a thin face and delicate features, with "bangs" hairstyle. Her small eyes seemed to be staring at everyone. She said: "This is my Hanyu, taken when she was about ten years old. Look how much she looks like her father!" Her face suddenly changed as she spoke, and she barely held back her tears and said, "But this child has already starved to death! After we returned to our hometown, we only had five fen of land in our family, and we ate sweet potato vines all year round, and sometimes we couldn't even eat that. When she was fourteen years old, her intestines broke and she died! Xiangqian died in February, and Hanyu also died in February. February is really an unlucky month for me!"
    After a long period of silence, she suddenly raised her head and said, "Xiangqian sacrificed for the happiness of the workers, and Hanyu was not able to live to see the happy days that her father had hoped for. But, millions upon millions of workers and their children are now happy!" Then, she picked up a single copy of the draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China and said, "I've talked too much about the past." She got up and went to the room and brought out a pile of things for the reporter to see. One was her certificate of election as a representative to the Shanggan Town People's Congress of Minhou County, one was her certificate of election as a representative to the Minhou County People's Congress, and a stack of photos taken for her by others when she traveled to Beijing, Tianjin, Wuhan, Shanghai, and other places some time ago. She said, "In the past, we workers were treated like animals by the rich, but now it is our world. The draft constitution makes it clear that we want to build a socialist society, and we will definitely be able to do it. I hope to live a few more years so that I can see that day. I want to do everything I can to participate in socialist construction." These days, she is actively campaigning to the voters. Some time ago, Guankang (her son) came back from Fuzhou to see her. He is now working in a state-owned factory in Fuzhou. Chen Guizhen especially instructed her son to work hard, learn from his father, and strive to build our country.
    Our conversation ended, and she accompanied the reporter to see her gardens. At this time, on the fields on both sides of the Minjiang River, ripe rice was shimmering golden in the bright sunshine, groups of farmers were harvesting, and children were splashing and playing in the small ponds. She said meaningfully:
  "Look, these are the good days of the working people. Xiangqian's wish has really blossomed and borne fruit."

    烈士的愿望开了花，结了果
    新华社记者　龚人左
    记者最近访问了“二七”烈士林祥谦夫人陈桂贞，请她谈她对宪法草案的感想。
    陈桂贞一开头就很激动，她说：“叫我怎样讲才好呢？宪法草案开头第一条就讲明我们国家是工人阶级领导的，里面又规定了劳动人民有很多权利，我真不知道怎样讲才好。”她沉思了一会儿，又慢慢地说：“自从宪法草案公布后，我常常想起祥谦牺牲前后的一些事情。三十一年了，祥谦当年流血牺牲所要争的自由、人权现在在宪法草案里写上了，他的血没有白流，祥谦的愿望，总算开了花，结了果了。我，到底等到了这一天，亲眼看到当年祥谦所希望的日子。同志，我要详细地讲给你听：祥谦是怎样牺牲的，这些年我们是怎样生活过来的。”
    陈桂贞记得很清楚，她说：“一九二三年二月七日，就是出事的那一天的中午，祥谦从工会里回来，那时他是京汉铁路总工会江岸分会的委员长。我问他：‘这几天出了什么事，家里的事你一点也不管，瘦得不像个人。’祥谦停了一会儿回答说：
  ‘我们在罢工，争自由，争人权，为工人谋幸福！’那时我是一个家庭妇女，除了丈夫、孩子、烧饭、补袜，别的事情很少知道。我问他什么叫‘为工人谋幸福？’祥谦抚摸着四岁的女儿汉玉说：‘将来汉玉长大了就会得到幸福的。’他说完就匆匆地走了。那时外边风声很紧，傍晚，外边闹得更厉害，有个工人来向我报信说：祥谦给抓去了。我奔到江岸车站，看到祥谦和很多工人被绑在电线杆上，我拚命挤到祥谦跟前，哭着、嚷着。祥谦却安慰我说：‘不要哭，我如果死了，你要好好照顾汉玉，养出来的孩子，不管是男是女，都要养大他……。’丈夫的话还没有说完，军阀的狗腿子就用枪柄把我打回去，那时我已经怀孕三四个月了”。陈桂贞讲到这里，眼睛里已含满了热泪，声音都沙哑了。她停了一下，接着说：“不久，工人来告诉我说：祥谦牺牲了。工人说，祥谦死得很英勇，他被绑在车站的电线杆上，军阀吴佩孚的爪牙张厚生亲自逼迫祥谦下上工命令，祥谦不答应，张厚生叫刽子手砍他一刀，问：‘到底下不下上工命令？’祥谦喊道：‘没有总工会命令，我头可断，工是不上的！’张厚生命令再砍一刀，祥谦忍痛大骂：‘现在还有什么可说，一个好好的中国，就断送在你们这些混账王八蛋的军阀手中…… 。’张听了更火了，又砍一刀，祥谦就这样牺牲了。在这一天牺牲的工人中还有祥谦的弟弟林元成。他们二人的尸体都放在我那破房子里，我守着哭了很久很久，后来不哭了，他们死了，我可不能死，我要活下去，看看这些混账王八蛋怎样结局，我也要看看，祥谦所讲的幸福是怎样的。”
    陈桂贞继续说：“第二天，别人告诉我，军阀吴佩孚的报纸上说：林祥谦是共产党员，所以要把他杀掉。我那时还是第一次听到共产党这个名号，祥谦从来没有跟我讲过。我想：祥谦是个好人，共产党也一定是好人，他们大概就是像祥谦所说的要为工人谋幸福的人。我没有想错，事实证明，共产党的确是这样的。”
    陈桂贞继续回忆着悲痛的往事：“话又说回来，那时我真是祸不单行。祥谦的父亲自从两个儿子被军阀杀死以后，就一直疯疯癫癫。一天，他在锅炉房里干活，干得慢一点，工贼就跑过来骂他说：‘你的两个儿子当土匪，你还能够在铁路上做工已经算便宜了你，还不好好地干，真该死！’祥谦的父亲顶了他一句，那个工贼就一脚踢在他小肚上，老人家受不起这打击，不久就死了。汉口呆不下去了，我这孤苦零仃的妇女伴着三口棺材回到尚干镇来，工人和共产党的地下组织募集了一些钱给我。那时，家里只有三个人，我，汉玉和祥谦死后六个月出生的一个男孩子——冠康。”
    陈桂贞在讲话中提到了她的女儿汉玉，她说：
  “祥谦非常爱这个孩子。祥谦刚死，军阀派了反动军队到我家里来搜查，翻箱倒箧，凡是有字的纸头都拿去。那时，工会的印戳子还放在祥谦没有穿去的一件衣服里，汉玉年纪小，反动军队不大注意她，她偷偷地把印戳子藏起来。后来工人都称赞她，问她为什么要这样做，她说：‘爸爸的东西不能让坏人拿去！’一个四岁的孩子已经知道谁是仇人了。”这时，陈桂贞指着挂在镜框里的一张照片给记者看，照片上是一个小姑娘，瘦削的脸庞长得很秀丽，梳着“前刘海”式的头发，小小的眼睛好像凝视着每一个人。她说：“这就是我的汉玉，十来岁时照的，你看多像他的爸爸啊！”说到这里，她的脸色忽然变了，她勉强忍住眼泪说：“可是这孩子已经饿死了！我们回到故乡后，家里只有五分田，整年啃着地瓜干，有时还吃不上。在十四岁时她的肠子坏了，死了！祥谦是二月死的，汉玉也是二月死的，对于我，二月真是个不幸的月份啊！”
    经过一段长时间的沉默后，她忽然昂起头来说：“祥谦为了谋工人的幸福牺牲了，汉玉也没有能够像他爸爸所希望的那样活到幸福的日子。可是，千千万万的工人和他们的儿女现在是得到幸福了！”接着，她拿起中华人民共和国宪法草案的单行本说：“过去的事情讲得太多了。”她站起来到房里拿出了一堆东西给记者看。一张是她当选为闽侯县尚干镇人民代表大会代表的证书，一张是她当选为闽侯县人民代表大会代表的证书，一叠是前些日子她到北京、天津、武汉、上海等地旅行时别人替她照的相片。她说：“过去我们工人是给有钱人当牛当马，现在是我们的天下了。宪法草案里讲明我们要建设社会主义社会，我们一定能够做到，我希望多活几年，能看到那一天。我要尽我的一切力量去参加社会主义建设。”这几天她正在积极向选民进行宣传。前些日子冠康（她的儿子）从福州回来看她，他现在在福州的一个国营工厂里做工。陈桂贞特别嘱咐儿子说：要好好地干，学你父亲那样，努力来建设我们的国家。
    我们的谈话结束了，她伴着记者去看看她的田园。这时，闽江两岸的原野上，成熟的水稻在明朗的阳光下闪闪发出金光，一群一群农民正在收割，小池塘里孩子们正在泼水嬉戏。她意味深长地说：
  “你瞧，这就是劳动人民的好日子，祥谦的愿望真是开了花，结了果了。”
