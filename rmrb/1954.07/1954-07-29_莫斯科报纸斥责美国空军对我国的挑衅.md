Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 28th: Moscow newspapers published news about the U.S. Air Force's bandit-like attack on People's Republic of China aircraft in the Hainan Island area. Newspapers published commentaries on this issue, pointing out that the U.S. Air Force was the attacking party.

    "Pravda" published an article by Kraminov, titled: "New Provocations by American Pirates." Kraminov wrote: All honest people believe that the U.S. Air Force's unprovoked attack on People's Republic of China aircraft on July 26th is further proof of the aggressive actions taken by the U.S. armed forces, far from U.S. soil, against vital air and sea routes near the Chinese coast. This action can only be called deliberate provocation, the purpose of which is to worsen the international tension that has recently eased due to the democratic camp countries' tireless struggle for peace.

    Kraminov pointed out that on July 26th, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles made an alarmed statement saying that U.S. aircraft shot down two Chinese aircraft, supposedly... to prevent them from carrying out "rescue" missions. Then, a group of U.S. senators, congressmen, generals, and reactionary observers, notorious for their troublemaking, echoed Dulles's cries. They clearly want to stir up greater war hysteria in the United States. They released a smokescreen of lies and slanders, insisting that the downing of Chinese aircraft was the responsibility of the Chinese pilots themselves, attempting to use this absurd statement to justify the U.S. Air Force's piratical attack. But everyone knows that Chinese pilots were patrolling their own airspace, and the task assigned to them by their homeland was to protect its airspace; while U.S. pilots came thousands of kilometers away from U.S. borders to seek opportunities for conflict. The news reports irrefutably prove that the U.S. aircraft's attack on People's Republic of China aircraft was deliberate and meticulously prepared.

    Kraminov pointed out that, contrary to what Dulles said, the aircraft that attacked People's Republic of China aircraft were not "rescue" aircraft at all, but purely military aircraft. The British Conservative Party newspaper admitted this fact. Kraminov continued, the U.S. military's provocative actions in the Far East have aroused the justified indignation of all honest men and women. In Britain, these actions have not been supported but have been criticized. The indignation caused by the U.S. military's actions is even greater because the U.S. Air Force is beginning to threaten all aircraft that do not belong to the United States.

    Finally, Kraminov pointed out that the government of People's Republic of China has lodged a firm protest against the U.S. aircraft's actions and violation of Chinese airspace. Kraminov emphasized that this protest has won the sympathy and support of all those who cherish peace and international security. The American organizers of the provocative incident near Hainan Island have exposed their true colors as war instigators before the people of all countries.

    莫斯科报纸斥责美国空军对我国的挑衅
    【新华社二十八日讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十八日讯：莫斯科报纸刊载了关于美国空军在海南岛地区对中华人民共和国的飞机实行盗匪式的进攻的消息。各报就这个问题发表评论，指出美国空军是进攻的一方。
    “真理报”刊载了克拉米诺夫的一篇文章，题目是：“美国海盗的新的挑衅”。克拉米诺夫写道：一切正直人民都认为美国空军七月二十六日对中华人民共和国飞机的无端进攻是远离美国本土的美国武装部队对中国海岸附近的重要海空通路采取侵略行动的又一证明。这种行动只能够叫做是故意寻衅，其目的是使最近由于民主阵营国家进行了不倦的争取和平的斗争而趋于缓和的国际紧张局势恶化。
    克拉米诺夫指出，七月二十六日，美国国务卿杜勒斯大惊小怪地发表声明说，美国飞机击落了两架据说是……不让它们执行“援救”任务的中国飞机。接着，一批以他们的好乱成性著名的美国参议员、众议员、将军们和反动观察家们也跟着杜勒斯叫嚷一通。他们显然想在美国煽起更大的战争歇斯底里。他们放出谎言和诽谤的烟幕，硬说中国飞机的被击落要由中国驾驶员自己负责，企图用这种荒谬的说法来为美国空军的海盗式的进攻辩解。但是大家都知道，中国驾驶员是在他们自己的领空巡逻，他们的祖国交给他们的任务就是保护它的领空；而美国驾驶员则是到远离美国国界几千公里以外的地方来寻找冲突的机会。报纸报道的消息无可辩驳地证明了，美国飞机对中华人民共和国飞机的进攻是蓄意的、是经过缜密准备的。
    克拉米诺夫指出，和杜勒斯所说的相反，袭击中华人民共和国的飞机的飞机，完全不是什么“救护式”飞机而纯粹是军用飞机。英国保守党的报纸承认了这个事实。克拉米诺夫接着说，美国军方在远东的挑衅行动引起了一切正直男女的应有的愤慨。在英国，这些行动不但没有受到支持，反而受到了指责。由于美国空军正在开始威胁一切不属于美国的飞机，美国军方的行动所引起的愤慨更大了。
    最后，克拉米诺夫指出，中华人民共和国政府已经就美国飞机的行动和侵犯中国领空事件提出坚决的抗议。克拉米诺夫着重指出，这个抗议得到了一切珍视和平和国际安全的人们的同情和支持。海南岛附近挑衅事件的美国组织者在各国人民面前暴露了他们的战争煽动者的真面目。
