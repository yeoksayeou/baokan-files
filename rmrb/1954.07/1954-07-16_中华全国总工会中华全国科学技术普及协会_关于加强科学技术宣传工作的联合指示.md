    Joint Directive of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the All-China Association for Science and Technology Popularization on Strengthening Scientific and Technological Propaganda Work

    During the period of national planned economic construction, continuously improving the scientific and technological level of the working masses is an important condition for developing industrial production, promoting labor competition, and ensuring the completion and overfulfillment of national plans. Scientific and technological propaganda work is an important method to enrich workers' scientific and technological knowledge and improve their scientific and technological level. It is also a powerful means to cultivate the workers' materialistic worldview and conduct communist education among them. In the past few years, many trade union organizations have attached importance to this work, and in coordination with the Association for Science and Technology Popularization, they have carried out various scientific and technological propaganda activities among the working masses in various forms, achieving considerable results. For example, in Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, Tianjin, Dalian, and other places, they have used workers' cultural palaces, clubs, spare-time schools, and other venues to hold various scientific and technological lectures. In addition, many city science and technology popularization associations have mobilized association members in various enterprises to carry out scientific and technological propaganda work in their own enterprises in coordination with trade union organizations. This work has enriched the scientific and technological knowledge of the working masses in these enterprises, thereby broadening their ideological horizons, overcoming conservative ideas, improving the utilization rate of production equipment, exerting the effectiveness of machinery, reducing accidents, improving product quality, and saving tools and raw materials. It has also helped workers further learn and master advanced experience and improve production efficiency.

    However, from the perspective of the entire trade union organization system, scientific and technological propaganda work has not been universally valued, and the cooperation between trade unions and the Association for Science and Technology Popularization is not close enough. Some of the propaganda carried out in the past has mostly been sporadic and fragmented, remaining in an unplanned state. At the same time, in terms of understanding this work, some people believe that holding systematic scientific and technological propaganda is "a drop in the bucket," and even oppose scientific and technological propaganda work to the completion of production tasks. This has seriously affected the further development of scientific and technological propaganda work.

    In order to improve this situation, it is necessary to strengthen the close cooperation between trade union organizations and the Association for Science and Technology Popularization in scientific and technological propaganda work, and strengthen the regular leadership of this work, so as to further carry out scientific and technological propaganda among the staff and workers, and promote the vigorous upsurge of the technical innovation movement currently being carried out in various places, so as to meet the requirements of the general task during the national transition period. To this end, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the All-China Association for Science and Technology Popularization, after joint research, hereby issue the following instructions:

    1. Trade union organizations and science and technology popularization associations in all provinces and cities should, under the unified leadership of the local Party committees, closely cooperate, establish regular contacts, and, in combination with the specific conditions of various places, jointly discuss ways to carry out scientific and technological propaganda work, formulate plans, and earnestly implement them. The propaganda departments of trade union organizations in various places should list this work as an important item in their daily work, responsible for mobilizing and organizing the masses and collecting mass feedback, and helping the Association for Science and Technology Popularization solve problems such as venues and funding; and the Association for Science and Technology Popularization should assist the trade unions in solving problems such as lecturers, materials, and equipment.

    2. To carry out this work, full use can be made of the venues of workers' cultural palaces, clubs, and spare-time schools in various cities, districts, and grassroots levels to organize various systematic scientific and technological knowledge lectures, lectures, exhibitions, scientific and technological problem-solving meetings, experience exchange meetings between scientific and technological personnel and advanced producers, technical research meetings, and short-term training courses and classes, etc., on a city-wide, district-wide, or industry and mining-based basis. The content of the propaganda should pay attention to combining with production reality, and should also attach importance to the propaganda of basic natural science knowledge. Attention should be paid to the systematicness and scientificity of the propaganda, so that scientific and technological propaganda work can penetrate into the staff and workers, and help the staff and workers improve their cultural and technical level, so as to promote the continuous improvement of labor productivity.

    3. The targets of organized systematic scientific and technological knowledge lectures should generally be technical workers and newly promoted technical management cadres and transferred cadres from workers who have a cultural level equivalent to that of senior primary school and have certain practical operating experience. The weekly lecture time can be determined according to the specific conditions of various places, generally not exceeding two hours.

    4. In order to do this work well, the propaganda departments of trade unions and the science and technology popularization associations in various places should assign special personnel to be responsible for the liaison of this work, conduct regular supervision and inspection, and summarize the experience and report to the higher authorities after each stage of work is completed.

    中华全国总工会中华全国科学技术普及协会
    关于加强科学技术宣传工作的联合指示
    在国家有计划的经济建设时期，不断地提高工人群众的科学技术水平，是发展工业生产、推进劳动竞赛、保证完成和超额完成国家计划的重要条件。而科学技术的宣传工作，则是丰富工人的科学技术知识，提高他们的科学技术水平的重要方法之一，也是培养工人群众的唯物主义世界观，向他们进行共产主义教育的有力手段之一。几年来，许多工会组织已重视了这一工作，并配合科学技术普及协会在工人群众中运用各种形式进行了各种科学技术的宣传工作，获得了相当成绩。如北京、上海、武汉、天津、旅大等地都利用了工人文化宫、俱乐部、业余学校等场所，举办了各种科学技术讲座；还有许多城市的科学技术普及协会动员了各企业中的协会会员，在其本企业中配合工会组织进行了科学技术宣传工作。这些工作，曾丰富了这些企业的工人群众的科学技术知识，从而扩大了思想领域，克服了保守思想，提高了生产设备的利用率，发挥了机械的效能，减少了事故，提高了产品质量，节省了工具和原材料，并且还帮助工人进一步地学习和掌握先进经验，提高了生产效率。
    但目前从整个工会组织系统说来，对于科学技术的宣传工作，还没有普遍重视，工会与科学技术普及协会的关系也还配合的不够密切，过去所进行的一些宣传，也多半还是些零星片断的停留在无计划的状态，同时在对于这一工作的认识上，还有人认为举办系统的科学技术宣传，是“远水救不了近火”，甚至把科学技术宣传工作和完成生产任务对立起来。这就严重地影响了科学技术宣传工作的进一步开展。
    为了改善这一情况，必须加强工会组织和科学技术普及协会在科学技术宣传工作上的亲密合作，加强对这一工作的经常领导，以便进一步在职工群众中开展科学技术的宣传，促进目前各地正在开展的技术革新运动的蓬勃高涨，以适应国家过渡时期总任务的要求。为此，中华全国总工会和中华全国科学技术普及协会经共同研究，特作如下指示：
    一、各省、市工会组织和科学技术普及协会组织应在各地党委统一领导下，密切配合，建立经常的联系，结合各地具体情况，共同商讨开展科学技术宣传工作的办法，订出计划，认真执行。各地工会组织的宣传部门，应把这一工作列为日常工作的一个重要项目，负责动员组织群众和搜集群众反映等工作，并帮助科学技术普及协会解决场所、经费等问题；而科学技术普及协会应协助工会解决讲师、资料、仪器设备等问题。
    二、进行此项工作，可充分利用各市、区和基层的工人文化宫、俱乐部、业余学校的场所，组织全市性的、全区性的、或以产业、厂矿为单位的各种系统的和结合中心工作的科学技术知识讲座、讲演会、展览会、科学技术问题解答会、科学技术人员与先进生产者的经验交流会、技术研究会及短期训练班、学习班等等。宣传的内容应注意结合生产实际，还应重视自然科学基础知识的宣传，要注意宣传的系统性和科学性，使科学技术宣传工作深入到职工群众中去，帮助职工提高文化技术水平，以推动劳动生产率的不断提高。
    三、组织系统的科学技术知识讲座的对象，目前一般应以具有相当于高小的文化水平，并有一定实际操作经验的技术工人和新从工人中提拔起来的技术管理干部以及转业干部为主。每周讲课时间可根据各地具体情况决定，一般以不超过两小时为宜。
    四、为了作好这一工作，各地工会宣传部门和各地科学技术普及协会应指派专人负责这一工作的联系，经常进行督促检查，并在每一工作阶段结束后，总结经验向上级汇报。
                        一九五四年七月一日
