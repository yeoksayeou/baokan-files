Sichuan Province's new rapeseed oil is being continuously transferred to East China, as well as Xikang and Tibet. The outward transfer plan for June has been overfulfilled by 7.3 percent. This year, the total output of rapeseed in Sichuan Province increased by about 24 percent compared to last year. After purchasing the rapeseed, state-owned oil companies and supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels promptly organize processing in oil mills within the province, and help them improve oil extraction technology, thereby improving the quality and output of rapeseed oil. In Xindu County, which is rich in rapeseed production, the county's 24 oil mills produced an average of 40 jin of oil per 100 jin of rapeseed last year, and now they can produce an average of 42 jin of oil per 100 jin of rapeseed.

    四川省新菜油源源外运
    四川省新菜油源源调往华东及西康、西藏等地。六月份的外调计划已超额百分之七点三完成。今年四川省菜籽的总产量约比去年增加百分之二十四。各级国营油脂公司和供销合作社在收购菜籽后，就及时组织省内各油坊加工，并帮助他们改进榨油技术，提高了菜油的质量和产量。盛产菜籽的新都县，全县二十四座油碾，去年平均每百斤菜籽产油四十斤，现在平均每百斤菜籽可产油四十二斤。（新华社）
