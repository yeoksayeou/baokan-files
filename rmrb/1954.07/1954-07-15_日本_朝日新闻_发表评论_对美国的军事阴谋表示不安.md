Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 14th: The widely circulated Japanese bourgeois newspaper "Asahi Shimbun" is uneasy about the United States' increasing efforts to drag Japan into its new military conspiracy in the Far East.

    "Asahi Shimbun" published a commentary on the 13th, saying: "The United States has shown so much concern for Japan recently that it makes us uneasy..." Referring to recent talks by US President Eisenhower, Secretary of State Dulles, and some senators emphasizing Japan's need for American economic "aid," "Asahi Shimbun" pointed out: These talks are all accompanied by a "proviso": "They say Japan is a fortress for the defense of the Pacific. Behind the elevation of Japan's status is their desire to accelerate Japan's rearmament and make Japan participate in the Asian anti-communist alliance..."
      "Asahi Shimbun" pointed out that the United States' activities in organizing the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc to interfere in the Indochina war have been universally opposed by the people of Asian countries, and worried that Japan might "be drawn into the vortex of the United States' Far East policy."

    对美国的军事阴谋表示不安
    【新华社十四日讯】东京消息：销路很广的日本资产阶级报纸“朝日新闻”对美国加紧把日本拉入美国在远东的新军事阴谋感到不安。
    “朝日新闻”十三日发表评论说：“美国近来对日本表示的关心是这样多，以至于使我们感到不安……。”“朝日新闻”在提到美国总统艾森豪威尔、国务卿杜勒斯和一些参议员最近强调日本需要美国的经济“援助”的谈话后指出：这些谈话都附有一个“但书”：“他们说日本是太平洋防御的堡垒。在抬高日本身价的背后，是他们要加速日本重整军备和使日本参加亚洲反共联盟的欲望……”
      “朝日新闻”指出了美国筹组东南亚侵略集团干涉印度支那战争的活动受到亚洲各国人民的普遍反对，并且担心日本可能“被拉入美国远东政策的漩涡”。
