    In Altai Krai
    Soviet Union, Bo Rirnov
    The majestic Altai Mountains stand tall on the border of the People's Republic of China. Beyond the mountains extends the vast Altai Krai of the Soviet Union. Altai is rich, and its natural conditions are beautiful. To the southeast and east are rustling pine and cypress forests, to the south stretches the fertile Robtsov steppe, and to the north lies the Kulunda steppe. There are over a thousand rivers and more than three thousand lakes here.

    Altai is a krai with a vast, multi-sectoral agriculture. Currently, there are more than 1,300 large, consolidated collective farms, over 200 machine tractor stations, and over 100 state farms. The machine tractor stations possess dozens of tractors and combine harvesters. The sowing and harvesting of crops are almost entirely mechanized, and the heavy operations in animal husbandry have been widely mechanized. Due to this high degree of mechanization, Altai's cultivated area has expanded by approximately 1.7 times compared to the pre-revolutionary period.

    This spring, the farmers of Altai Krai launched a widespread offensive on virgin and fallow lands. In the next two years, they must reclaim 2.3 million hectares of new land, on which to sow high-quality wheat. More than 26,000 industrial enterprise workers and experts have come here from the cities and villages of Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and other Soviet republics to cultivate the wasteland. More than 1,200 new tractor brigades have been established, and they have received powerful crawler tractors, combine harvesters, and other excellent machinery. Hundreds of thousands of hectares of virgin land have already been reclaimed and sown on the Kulunda and Robtsov steppes.

    The pace of sowing is accelerating daily. Inspired by the initiative of Pavel Gopin, a Hero of Socialist Labor from the Nasarov Machine Tractor Station in Mikhailovsky District, a socialist competition to harvest 100 poods of grain per hectare has unfolded in Altai. Altai's farmers guarantee to deliver no less than 400 million poods of grain to the state this year, and thousands of Altai machinery operators are striving to complete this task. Other work teams are also emulating the example of Pavel Gopin's work team, displaying excellent examples of labor.

    The entire crew of the Yevgeny Dakhnovsky tractor brigade moved from Kuban to the Blagoveshchensky Machine Tractor Station. Tractor driver Nikolai Ratonko reclaims eighteen hectares of fallow land daily on the "New Road" collective farm, exceeding the original quota of twelve hectares. A small red flag flutters on his tractor, a symbol of his championship in the work team's competition. Other tractor drivers are also working effectively. Because the Dakhnovsky tractor brigade has already reclaimed and sown over 1,000 hectares of wheat on the new land, it has won the mobile red flag from the Blagoveshchensky District Party Committee and the Executive Committee of the Soviet of Workers' Deputies.

    The sunny days of the Altai summer allow not only wheat to grow on the Altai land, but also industrial raw material crops, cultivated crops, vegetables, and fruits. The experience of scientific institutions and agricultural pioneers indicates that growing maize under Altai conditions can yield a large amount of silage: 70 to 80 tons per hectare. Last year, agronomist Zolotov obtained such a high maize yield by sowing hybrid seeds in the Gorny Altai Agricultural Experimental Station area. His experience has now been applied to the production work of various collective farms and state farms. Tens of thousands of hectares of virgin land have already been used to grow maize. Maize is sown using the square-cluster method, which makes cross-sowing possible. The area sown with new crops has also been expanded in the Altai-Chumysh district. In Altai Krai, sunflowers, flax, ramie, sugar beets, and low-grade tobacco have all been sown on a larger scale.

    It was previously thought that apples could not grow in Altai. But the Soviet people have dealt with this matter in a different way. There are now 756 Altai collective farms engaged in orchard management. Various new and excellent varieties of apples, pears, cherries, and grapes are maturing in Altai's harsh climate. Many gooseberries, buckthorns, and other berries also grow in Altai. This spring, collective farms and state farms are busy setting up new orchards and berry gardens. Saplings have been planted on many streets in Barnaul, the center of the krai.

    Altai is known for its developed animal husbandry with highly productive output. In Gorny Altai, meat and dairy cattle are mainly grazed. However, sheep farming has been developed in all grassland areas, and fine wool sheep farming has begun to intensify in recent years. The "Altai Fine Wool" sheep breed with high productivity has been cultivated in the Robtsov district. Last year, in the Robtsov collective farm, more than 14 kilograms of wool were shorn from rams of this breed, each averaging 110 kilograms in weight. In the Gorny Altai Autonomous Oblast, a new breed of dairy cow has been cultivated by crossbreeding Simmental cattle and yaks. Each cow of this breed produces an average of more than 2,000 liters of milk per year, with a fat content of 5% to 5.6%. Altai livestock breeders are striving to greatly increase the number of livestock and improve their productivity, and to stockpile more fodder for the wintering of livestock.

    Life in Altai is seething. The workers are fighting to implement the resolutions of the September and February-March Plenums of the CPSU Central Committee last year and this year, as well as the various resolutions formulated by the Party and the government to further improve the material well-being of the Soviet people.

    在阿尔泰边疆区
    苏联　勃·日尔诺夫
    雄伟的阿尔泰山巍然耸立在中华人民共和国境界上。山那边扩展着广大的苏联阿尔泰边疆区。阿尔泰是富饶的，它的自然条件是美妙的。东南方和东方有飒飒作响的松柏树林，南方展开着肥沃的罗勃卓夫草原，北面有古仑达草原。这儿有一千多条河流和三千个以上的湖泊。
    阿尔泰是具有巨大的多部门的农业的边疆区。现在这儿有一千三百多个合并而成的大集体农庄，二百个以上的机器拖拉机站和一百个以上的国营农场。机器拖拉机站拥有几十台拖拉机和收割联合机。播种和收割庄稼差不多已全部机械化了，畜牧业中的繁重操作过程已普遍地机械化。由于高度的机械化，阿尔泰的耕种面积比革命以前的时期大约扩大到一点七倍。
    今年春天，阿尔泰边疆区的农民们对生荒地和熟荒地开始了广泛的进攻。这儿在最近两年时间里必须开拓二百三十万公顷的新地，要在上面播种品质优良的小麦。有二万六千名以上的工业企业工人和专家从俄罗斯、乌克兰、白俄罗斯和其他苏维埃加盟共和国的城市和农村来到这里开垦荒地。已经建立了一千二百个以上的新拖拉机工作队，他们已领到了强大的履带拖拉机、收割联合机和其他优良的机器。古仑达和罗勃卓夫草原上已经开垦和播种了几十万公顷的生荒地。
    播种工作的速度正在日益加快。由于米哈依洛夫区纳萨洛夫机器拖拉机站来的社会主义劳动英雄巴佛尔·戈平的拖拉机工作队的发起，争取每公顷收获一百普特谷物的社会主义竞赛已经在阿尔泰展开了。阿尔泰的农民们保证在本年交给国家的谷物不少于四亿普特，数千阿尔泰机器操使者都在争取完成这个任务。其他工作队里也仿效巴佛尔·戈平工作队的榜样，表现出了优良的劳动范例。
    叶夫格尼·达赫诺夫斯基拖拉机工作队的全班人马从库班迁到了勃拉古维兴斯基机器拖拉机站。拖拉机手尼古拉·拉童柯每天在“新路”集体农庄上开垦十八公顷的熟荒地以代替原定的十二公顷的定额。他的拖拉机上飘扬着小红旗，这是他在工作队的竞赛中保持冠军的标志。其他拖拉机手们也很有效地进行着工作。由于达赫诺夫斯基拖拉机工作队在新土地上已经开垦和播种了一千多公顷的小麦，因此获得了勃拉古维兴斯基区党委会和劳动者代表苏维埃区执行委员会的流动红旗。
    阿尔泰夏季的阳光充足的日子，使得阿尔泰土地上不仅能够生长小麦，而且也能栽种工业原料作物、中耕作物、蔬菜和水果。科学机关和农业先进者的经验指出，在阿尔泰条件下种玉蜀黍可以获得大批青储饲料：每公顷可收七十到八十吨。去年农艺师佐洛托夫在果尔诺阿尔泰农业实验站地区，用杂交种籽播种就获得了这样高的玉蜀黍收成。他的经验现时已运用到各集体农庄和国营农场的生产工作上去。已经有数万公顷的生荒地被用来种玉蜀黍。玉蜀黍是按正方穴播法播种的，这种方法使得纵横播种都有可能。在阿尔泰——楚密士区也扩大了新作物的播种面积。在阿尔泰边疆区，向日葵、亚麻、苎麻、甜菜、次等烟草，都以更大的规模进行了播种。
    先前认为阿尔泰是不能生长苹果的。但苏维埃人们用不同的态度处理了这件事情。现在已有七百五十六个阿尔泰集体农庄在从事果园经营。在阿尔泰严寒的天气下，各种新的优良品种的苹果、梨、樱桃、葡萄都成熟了。许多酸栗、鼠李和其他浆果在阿尔泰也生长起来。今年春天集体农庄和国营农场里在进行布置新的果园和浆果园。在边疆区的中心巴尔瑙尔的许多街上都种植了果树苗。
    阿尔泰是以发达的、有高度产品生产率的畜牧业著称的。在果尔诺阿尔泰主要牧放肉食和产乳用的牛。但是在所有的草原区上则发展了养羊业，近年来细毛绵羊业已开始加紧发展起来。罗勃卓夫区里培养出了有高度产品生产率的“阿尔泰细毛”绵羊品种。去年在罗勃卓夫集体农庄里，由每只平均重一百一十公斤的这样品种的公绵羊身上剪了十四公斤以上的羊毛。在果尔诺阿尔泰州用西门塔尔牛和犛牛异种交配的方法培养出了新奶牛品种。每只这样品种的奶牛每年平均要出二千公升以上的、含脂量百分之五到五点六的牛奶。阿尔泰畜产家们正在设法大大地增加牲畜头数和提高它们的产品生产率，储备更多的饲料以备牲畜过冬。
    阿尔泰的生活在沸腾着。劳动者们正在为实现苏共中央去年九月和今年二——三月全会的决议以及党和政府所拟定的进一步提高苏联人民物质福利的各项决议而奋斗。
