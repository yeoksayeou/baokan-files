    Regularly Holds Bazaars in Deep Mountain Pastures

    The state-owned trading store and supply and marketing cooperative in Wuqia County, located on the edge of the Pamir Plateau in Xinjiang, have recently begun holding regular bazaars (markets) in the deep mountain pastures where Kyrgyz herders roam, further developing the exchange of goods in the nomadic areas.
    These regular bazaars are held every half month or month. In May and June of this year, seven bazaars were held in four pastures in Wuqia County, supplying herders with large quantities of grain, cloth, hunting rifles, wolf traps, wool shears, and more than 40 other kinds of goods, with a total value of over 96 million yuan, greatly exceeding the previous sales volume in these pastures. The No. 2 District Supply and Marketing Cooperative of Wuqia County held three bazaars in three locations in the Yuqitash pasture, where 365 herding families roam, in a span of twenty days, selling out all the grain, cloth, and various goods transported by thirty camels. Before the regular bazaars were held, it would take the mobile trade team more than two months to supply the herders with the items carried by thirty camels. Holding regular bazaars on the grassland not only accelerates the capital turnover of state-owned trading stores and supply and marketing cooperatives but also enables herders to sell their livestock products or buy the goods they need at the bazaar on time,打击了投机商人. Kyrgyz herders joyfully said: "The People's Government has done another good thing for us."
    Wuqia County is characterized by overlapping mountains and scattered herder residences, making transportation inconvenient. Before liberation, unscrupulous merchants often exploited herders by exchanging a bag of needles for a sheepskin or a few feet of cloth for a sheep. After liberation, Wuqia County successively established state-owned trading stores and supply and marketing cooperatives, and sent mobile trade teams deep into various pastures to supply herders with production and living goods and purchase livestock products. However, with the development of animal husbandry production, the goods needed by herders and the local and special products for sale have been increasing day by day, and the quantity of goods carried by the mobile trade teams can no longer meet the needs of herders. Therefore, the state-owned trading store and supply and marketing cooperative of Wuqia County recently started holding regular bazaars in pastures with relatively concentrated populations to further develop trade work in the nomadic areas.

    新疆省乌恰县国营贸易商店
    在深山草场中定期举行集市
    新疆帕米尔高原边缘的乌恰县国营贸易商店和供销合作社，最近在柯尔克兹族牧民游牧的深山草场中，定期举行巴扎（集市），进一步发展了游牧区的物资交流。
    这种定期巴扎每半月或一月举行一次，今年五、六两个月内，在乌恰县的四处草场上举行了七次巴扎，供应给牧民大批粮食、布匹和猎枪、狼夹、羊毛剪刀等四十多种货物，价值总额有九千六百多万元，大大超过了以前在这些草场上销售的数量。乌恰县二区供销合作社，二十天中在有三百六十五户牧民游牧的玉旗塔什草场的三处地方分别举行了三次巴扎，三十个骆驼运去的粮食、布匹和各种货物销售一空。在没有定期举行巴扎以前，流动贸易组要把三十个骆驼驮运的物品供应给牧民，就需要两个多月。草原上定期举行巴扎，不但加速了国营贸易商店和供销合作社的资金流转，也使牧民都能按时在巴扎上出售畜产品或买回自己需要的物品，打击了投机商人。柯尔克兹族牧民都喜悦地说：人民政府又为我们办了一件好事。
    乌恰县境内山岭重叠，牧民居住分散，交通不便。解放前，奸商经常用一包针换一张羊皮或用几尺布换一只羊来剥削牧民。解放后，乌恰县先后建立了国营贸易商店和供销合作社，并派出流动贸易组深入各草场，供应牧民生产、生活用品和收购畜产品。但随着畜牧业生产的发展，牧民需要的物品和出售的土产特产品日益增多，流动贸易组携带的货物数量已不能满足牧民的需要。因此，乌恰县国营贸易商店和供销合作社最近在人口比较集中的草场上定期举行巴扎，进一步发展了游牧区的贸易工作。（新华社）
