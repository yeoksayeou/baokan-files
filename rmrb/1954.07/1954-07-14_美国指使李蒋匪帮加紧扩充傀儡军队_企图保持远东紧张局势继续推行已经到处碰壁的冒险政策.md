The United States Instructs the Li-Chiang Bandit Gang to Intensify the Expansion of Puppet Armies
Attempting to Maintain Tension in the Far East and Continue Pursuing its Adventure Policy That Has Met Obstacles Everywhere
Xinhua News Agency, July 13th: Following the dispatch of Van Fleet to the Far East to orchestrate aggressive activities, the Li Seung-man and Chiang Kai-shek bandit gangs are intensifying the expansion of their puppet armies, preparing to serve as cannon fodder for new military adventures launched by the United States in Asia.

According to Western news agencies, "authoritative sources" in Washington revealed that the South Korean Ambassador to the United States, Y. T. Pyun, submitted to US Secretary of State Dulles on the 7th a request from Li Seung-man to expand the Li puppet army. In this request, Li Seung-man demanded that the United States substantially increase military "aid" to South Korea, increasing the Li Seung-man puppet army from its current 650,000 to 1,000,000. Li Seung-man also requested that the United States provide a considerable number of new combat aircraft and naval vessels. In accepting this request, Dulles assured Y. T. Pyun that the United States would "fully consider the desire to provide a large amount of military supplies." At the same time, South Korean Minister of National Defense Sohn Won-yil announced on the 10th that South Korea would greatly expand and strengthen its army, navy, and air force, and confirmed that in addition to requesting the United States to substantially expand the regular forces of the Li puppet army, South Korea also requested the United States to establish a reserve force of 1,000,000 men for the Li puppet army.

Meanwhile, provocative war cries from Seoul are becoming increasingly rampant. Keo Hong-ki, a spokesman for the Li Seung-man clique, said arrogantly on the 11th that if the United States and other allies did not restart the war of aggression, South Korea would "go it alone." He also threatened that the Geneva Conference's discussion of the Korean issue was "our final legal obligation to the armistice agreement," and that "we are now free actors." This degenerate of the Korean nation hysterically shouted that South Korea "is determined to fight to the last man, woman, and child." Keo Hong-ki also announced that South Korea was negotiating with the United States on the expansion of the Li puppet army, and stated that "negotiations are proceeding well."

The Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang is also stepping up its efforts to expand the cannon fodder for the US war of aggression. According to United Press International, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang has begun to implement a plan to forcibly train 40,000 young people each year and incorporate them into the reserve force of the Chiang Kai-shek army. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang forcibly sent thousands of young people to four training locations on the 8th to conduct four months of military training.

These sinister actions by the United States in directing the Li-Chiang bandit gangs show that the United States is determined to disregard the Asian people's urgent desire to establish peace and security in Asia, continue to pursue its adventurous policy that has been thwarted everywhere, attempt to maintain tension in the Far East, launch new wars of aggression, and carry out more aggressive activities against New China. However, the results of the Korean War and the Indochina War have clearly demonstrated that if the aggressors do not learn their lesson and are determined to be enemies of the Asian people, they will suffer the bitter consequences themselves.

    美国指使李蒋匪帮加紧扩充傀儡军队
    企图保持远东紧张局势继续推行已经到处碰壁的冒险政策
   【新华社十三日讯】在美国派遣范佛里特到远东来部署侵略活动以后，李承晚和蒋介石匪帮正在加紧扩充傀儡军队，准备为美国在亚洲发动新的军事冒险卖命。
    据西方通讯社报道，华盛顿方面的“权威人士”透露，南朝鲜驻美国的大使梁祐灿已在七日把李承晚提出的一项扩充李伪军的请求送交美国国务卿杜勒斯。李承晚在这项请求中要求美国大量增加对南朝鲜的军事“援助”，把李承晚伪军从现在的六十五万人增加到一百万人。李承晚还要求美国给予相当数量的新式的战斗飞机和海军舰艇。杜勒斯在接受这项请求时向梁佑灿保证，美国将“充分考虑给予大量军事物资的愿望”。同时，南朝鲜国防部长官孙元一在十日宣布，南朝鲜将大量扩充并加强陆、海、空军，并且证实，南朝鲜除了要求美国大量扩充李伪军的正规部队外，还要求美国建立一支有一百万人的李伪军的后备队。
    同时，来自汉城的挑衅性的战争叫嚣，越来越猖狂了。李承晚集团的发言人葛弘基在十一日又狂妄地说，如果美国和其他盟国不重新发动侵略战争，南朝鲜将要“单独干”。他还威胁说，日内瓦会议关于朝鲜问题的讨论是“我们对停战协定的最后的法律义务”，“我们现在是自由行动者”。这个朝鲜民族的败类歇斯底里地嚷着，南朝鲜“已决心打到最后一个男人、妇女和小孩”。葛弘基还宣布，南朝鲜正在和美国谈判扩充李伪军的问题，并且表示，“谈判进行得很好”。
    蒋介石匪帮也正在加紧为美国扩充侵略战争的炮灰。据合众社报道，蒋匪帮已经开始实施每年强迫四万名青年受军事训练，并把他们编入蒋匪军后备队的计划。蒋匪帮已在八日把数千名青年强迫送往四个训练地点，对他们进行四个月的军事训练。
    美国指使李蒋匪帮进行的这种罪恶行动表明，美国决意不顾亚洲人民建立亚洲和平和安全的迫切愿望，继续推行已经到处碰壁的冒险政策，企图保持远东紧张局势，发动新的侵略战争，并对新中国进行更多的侵略活动。但是，朝鲜战争和印度支那战争的结果已经清楚地证明，侵略者如果不接受教训，决意与亚洲人民为敌，将自食悲惨的后果。
