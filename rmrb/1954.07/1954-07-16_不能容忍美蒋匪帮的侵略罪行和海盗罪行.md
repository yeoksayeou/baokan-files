    The Taiwan Kuomintang remnant bandit gang, under the protection and support of the United States, has increasingly become a tool for the United States to invade our country, endanger the security of the Far East, threaten Asian peace, and create international tensions. For a long time, the United States has forcibly occupied our territory of Taiwan, using Taiwan as a base to direct the Kuomintang remnant bandit gang to carry out various forms of war activities against our country. The U.S. armed forces direct the Chiang Kai-shek remnant bandit gang to rampantly intercept merchant ships of various countries and harass our mainland coast and coastal islands. This lawless piracy is clearly an armed aggression against our country by the U.S. warmongering clique and a serious provocation against the peace forces of the world.

    The United States launched the war of aggression against Korea in June 1950, while brazenly occupying our territory of Taiwan by armed force. Its purpose was not only to attempt to destroy the integrity of our country's territorial sovereignty by force and prevent our liberation of Taiwan, but also to turn Taiwan into a military base for it to launch armed attacks against our country and invade Asia. The U.S. warmongers have constantly made shameless cries and spared no effort to provide the Kuomintang remnant bandits with weapons and ammunition, and sent so-called military advisory groups to Taiwan to arm and train the Kuomintang bandit gang's defeated soldiers. In recent years, the U.S. military aid to the Kuomintang remnant bandits has reached approximately one billion U.S. dollars. The United States has allocated jet aircraft and naval vessels to the Kuomintang remnant bandits to strengthen the Kuomintang remnant bandits' air force and navy. The United States has sent its military personnel to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops entrenched on Jinmen Island, Dachen Island, and other coastal islands of our country, and even plans to establish U.S. air force bases in the Penghu Islands. Recently, U.S. war peddler Van Fleet, in the name of "Special Representative" of the U.S. President, ran to Taiwan three times in an attempt to sign a so-called "bilateral common security treaty" between the United States and the Taiwan Kuomintang remnant bandit gang, in order to link up with the military alliance established by the United States and its other puppet groups in the Far East. This conspiracy of the United States is clearly to fix the U.S. aggression of forcibly occupying our territory in the form of a treaty, making it a fact that cannot be changed in the eyes of the United States, so as to formally turn Taiwan into a colony of U.S. imperialism, keep the unrest in Asia and the world lasting, and intensify its policy of invading China, endangering Asia and world peace.

    The victory of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and the victory of our country's peaceful diplomacy have made our country's international status increasingly elevated, and the call for improving relations with our country has become even louder in various countries around the world. The visit of our Premier Zhou Enlai to India and Burma has given our country a deeper understanding of India, Burma, and Southeast Asian countries, and has further developed the friendly relations between each other. At the same time, many Western countries are also demanding to improve relations with our country and restore and develop their economic and cultural exchanges with our country. Under this situation, the U.S. ruling clique has shown no sign of repentance. On the contrary, because it fears that the Asian situation may ease and fears the improvement of our country's international status, it has intensified its use of the Taiwan military base and the Chiang Kai-shek remnant bandit gang it raises, and lawlessly expanded its piratical activities on the high seas near Taiwan, expanding its aggressive activities against the People's Republic of China. This cannot but arouse the unanimous opposition of all countries and peoples who advocate world peace and international security.

    People know that the piratical crimes of the U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek clique are becoming increasingly serious. Since 1950, ships belonging to countries such as Britain, Denmark, Norway, Italy, Portugal, the Netherlands, Panama, Greece, West Germany, Poland, and the Soviet Union have been attacked by the U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in the waters near Taiwan. In recent years, the U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang has hijacked as many as 70 merchant ships to and from our country and countries trading with our country, including 40 British merchant ships. On December 1, 1952, a British ship was attacked by U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek warships, and Captain Robert Adams was killed. Recently, these incidents of blatant violations of international law have become more serious. On October 4, 1953, and May 13, 1954, U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek warships illegally intercepted Polish merchant ships twice. On June 23, the U.S. Navy launched an armed attack on the Soviet merchant ship "Tuapse" and illegally detained the ship and its crew. Thus, Taiwan has become a pirate's nest established by the United States on the high seas in the Far East, openly robbing merchant ships in broad daylight, endangering the international navigation safety and the interests of international trade of various countries. At the same time, the Taiwan Chiang bandit gang armed by the United States has recently continued to harass our coast; U.S. warships and aircraft also frequently intrude into our territorial waters and airspace from Taiwan to carry out provocations. For example, on March 23, 1954, U.S.-made Chiang aircraft intruded into the coastal and inland areas of our Fujian Province in as many as 13 batches and 16 sorties. On June 1, two aircraft carriers, one cruiser, and six destroyers of the U.S. Seventh Fleet intruded into the waters of Dachen Island, Zhejiang Province, and U.S. aircraft hovered near Dachen Island in 49 batches and 134 sorties. Recently, when U.S. war peddler Van Fleet went to Taiwan, there was news that the United States even wanted to openly expand the scope of the U.S. Seventh Fleet's aggressive activities to the coastal islands of our country. Obviously, all these practices of the United States are to strengthen the U.S. military deployment near Taiwan, attempting to direct the Chiang bandit gang to carry out desperate adventurous actions against our coast and provoke a new disaster. Chase, the head of the "Military Assistance Advisory Group" of the United States in Taiwan, admitted that in all areas controlled by the United States, "Chiang Kai-shek's army is one of the cheapest strategic goods." The U.S. warmongering clique is regarding Chiang Kai-shek's remnant bandit army as a bet in its military adventure of "using Asians to fight Asians" in the Far East.

    However, the United States' provocative activities of using the Taiwan Chiang bandit gang to expand its aggression against the People's Republic of China will certainly not achieve any good results.

    Taiwan is the sacred and inviolable territory of the People's Republic of China. The U.S. armed occupation of Taiwan and the aggressive acts of plotting to use Taiwan as a military base for attacking the People's Republic of China are absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people. No matter what facts the U.S. imperialists attempt to create, no matter what aggressive activities they carry out, the 600 million people of the People's Republic of China are firmly determined to liberate their own territory of Taiwan and will never change! In his statement issued on June 28, 1950, our Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai solemnly pointed out: "No matter what obstructive actions the U.S. imperialists take, the fact that Taiwan belongs to China can never be changed," "All the people of our country will be united as one, and will fight to the end to liberate Taiwan from the hands of the U.S. aggressors." If the U.S. ruling clique dares to sign a so-called "bilateral common security treaty" or other similar treaties with the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, then it is determined to be in a long-term hostile position with the 600 million Chinese people, and thus it must bear the long-term serious consequences caused by this situation.

    Our people must heighten their vigilance and strengthen their preparations against the various piratical acts and aggressive activities of the U.S. aggressors, and smash all the aggressors' offensive activities. This just struggle of our people cannot be stopped by any force. Taiwan must return to the embrace of China, and the situation in Asia must move towards normalization; the activities of the United States to antagonize China and invade Asia are bound to suffer failure!

    不能容忍美蒋匪帮的侵略罪行和海盗罪行
    在美国庇护和支持下的台湾国民党残余匪帮，已日益成为美国侵略我国、危害远东安全、威胁亚洲和平、制造国际紧张局势的工具。长时期以来，美国就强占我国领土台湾，利用台湾作基地，指使国民党残余匪帮对我国进行各种形式的战争活动。美国武装部队指使蒋介石残余匪帮日益猖獗地拦劫各国商船，并对我国大陆海岸和沿海岛屿进行骚扰。这种无法无天的海盗行为，显然是美国好战集团对我国的武装侵略，和对全世界和平力量的严重挑衅。
    美国于一九五○年六月发动侵略朝鲜战争的同时，公然武装侵占了我国领土台湾，其目的不仅企图以武力破坏我国领土主权的完整，阻止我国解放台湾，并且要把台湾变成它对我国发动武装进攻和侵略亚洲的军事基地。美国好战分子曾不断发出恬不知耻的叫嚣，并不遗余力地以武器军火援助国民党残匪，派遣了所谓军事顾问团到台湾，武装和训练国民党匪帮的残兵败将。这几年来美国给予国民党残匪的军事援助已达约十亿美元。美国拨给了国民党残匪以喷气式飞机和海军舰只，来加强国民党残匪空军和海军的力量。美国已把它的军事人员派到盘据在金门岛、大陈岛等我国沿海岛屿的蒋匪军队里，甚至计划在澎湖列岛建立美国的空军基地。最近，美国战争贩子范佛里特又以美国总统“特别代表”名义三次跑到台湾，企图在美国及台湾国民党残余匪帮之间订立所谓“共同安全双边条约”，以便与美国和它在远东的其他傀儡集团所建立的军事联盟连结起来。美国的这种阴谋显然是想把美国强占我国领土的侵略行为以条约形式固定下来，成为在美国看来是不能改变的事实，从而使台湾正式变为美国帝国主义的殖民地，使亚洲的不安和世界的不安长期保持下去，加紧地推行它侵略中国、危害亚洲和世界和平的政策。
    抗美援朝的胜利，和我国和平外交的胜利，使我国国际地位日益提高，世界各国要求改善与我国之间关系的呼声更加高涨。我国周恩来总理到印度和缅甸的访问，使我国与印缅两国及东南亚国家有了更深刻的了解，并使相互之间的友好关系有了进一步的发展。同时，许多西方国家也都要求改善与我国的关系，恢复和发展它们与我国的经济和文化交流关系。在这个形势下面，美国统治集团却毫无悔改的表现。相反地，由于它害怕亚洲局势可能缓和，害怕我国国际地位的提高，它竟然更加加紧利用台湾军事基地和它所豢养的蒋介石残余匪帮，在台湾附近的公海上横行不法地扩大其海盗活动，扩大其对中华人民共和国的侵略活动。这就不能不引起主张世界和平与国际安全的各国和各国人民的一致反对。
    人们知道，美蒋匪帮的海盗罪行正在变本加厉。从一九五○年起，属于英国、丹麦、挪威、意大利、葡萄牙、荷兰、巴拿马、希腊、西德、波兰和苏联等国的船只，都在台湾附近海面受到美蒋匪帮的海盗攻击。几年来美蒋匪帮一共劫夺了我国及与我国贸易的国家来往商船达七十艘之多，其中英国的商船就有四十艘。一九五二年十二月一日，一艘英国船只遭到美蒋军舰的攻击，船长罗伯特·亚当斯竟被打死。近来，这种公然破坏国际法的事件更加严重了。一九五三年十月四日和一九五四年五月十三日美蒋军舰先后两次非法截扣波兰的商船。六月二十三日美国海军又对苏联商船“图阿普斯”号实行武装袭击，并把该船及船员非法扣留。这样，台湾就成了美国在远东公海上建立的一个海盗窝穴，在光天化日之下公然打劫商船，危害各国的国际航行安全和国际贸易的利益。同时，由美国所武装的台湾蒋匪帮，近来又不断地对我国海岸进行骚扰；美国的军舰和飞机也经常从台湾侵入我国领海和领空，实行挑衅。例如，在一九五四年三月二十三日一天中，美制蒋机侵入我福建省沿海和内地达十三批十六架次。六月一日，美国第七舰队的两只航空母舰，一只巡洋舰，六只驱逐舰侵入我国浙江大陈岛海面，美国飞机并在大陈岛附近盘旋的有四十九批、一百三十四架次。最近美国战争贩子范佛里特到台湾的时候，有消息说，美国竟想公然把美国第七舰队的侵略活动范围扩大到我国沿海的岛屿。显然的，美国的这一切作法，都是为了加强美国在台湾附近的军事布置，企图指使蒋匪帮对我国沿海进行绝望性的冒险行动，挑起一个新的祸端。美国驻台湾的“军事援助顾问团”团长蔡斯承认，在美国所控制的所有地区，“蒋介石的军队是最廉价的战略货色之一”。美国好战集团正在把蒋介石残余匪军看作它在远东“用亚洲人打亚洲人”的军事冒险的一笔赌注。
    但是，美国利用台湾蒋匪帮来扩大对中华人民共和国的侵略的挑衅活动，决然是得不到什么好结果的。
    台湾是中华人民共和国神圣不可侵犯的领土，美国武装侵占台湾，和阴谋利用台湾作为进攻中华人民共和国的军事基地的侵略行为，是中国人民所绝对不能容忍的。无论美帝国主义者企图制造什么事实，无论他们进行什么侵略活动，中华人民共和国六万万人民坚定不移地决心解放自己的国土台湾，永远不会改变！我国周恩来外长于一九五○年六月二十八日发表的声明中就曾郑重指出：“不管美国帝国主义者采取任何阻挠行动，台湾属于中国的事实，永远不能改变”，“我国全体人民，必将万众一心，为从美国侵略者手中解放台湾而奋斗到底。”如果美国统治集团竟敢于同台湾蒋介石匪帮订立所谓“共同安全双边条约”或其他类似的条约，那它就是决心要同六亿中国人民长期处于敌对地位，从而它就必须担负这一形势所造成的长期的严重的后果。
    对于美国侵略者的种种海盗行为和侵略活动，我国人民必须提高警惕，加强准备，粉碎侵略者的一切侵袭活动。我国人民的这个正义斗争是任何力量所不能阻挡的。台湾必须重归中国的怀抱，亚洲的局势必须走向正常化；美国敌视中国、侵略亚洲的活动是必然要遭受失败的！
