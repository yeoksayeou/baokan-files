Xinhua News Agency, Wellington, 10th dispatch: Reuters Wellington reported: New Zealand Foreign Minister Webb said in the House of Representatives on the 8th that he disagreed with the United States' opinion of not recognizing the legitimate status of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations. Webb believes that if people can consider the issue logically, they will think that the legitimate status of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations should be recognized as soon as possible. Webb said: "Countries that should not be excluded from the United Nations will inevitably enter the United Nations through some means. When that day comes, world tensions will ease, and the hope for peace will be greater than it is now."

    新西兰外长韦伯不同意美国的意见
    重申应早日承认我国在联合国的合法地位
　　【新华社十日讯】据路透社惠灵顿消息：新西兰外长韦伯八日在众议院说：他不同意美国的不承认中华人民共和国在联合国的合法地位的意见。韦伯认为：如果人们能从逻辑上来考虑问题的话，便会认为应该早日承认中华人民共和国在联合国的合法地位。韦伯说：“不应排除于联合国之外的国家通过某种方法，必然会进入联合国的。当这种日子到来的时候，世界紧张局势便会缓和，而且和平的希望也会比目前大。”
