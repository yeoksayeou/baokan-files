    山西省农民除治虫害获得初步成绩
    山西省农民积极除治虫害，并获得初步成绩。入夏以来，该省不少地区发生棉蚜、行军虫为害，虫害发生前后，各级党政领导机关都很重视防治工作，共准备了各种杀虫药剂四百一十五万斤，喷雾器四万七千台。同时各地还成立了除虫指挥部，建立和健全情报网，并组织了大批干部深入虫区领导农民进行除治。雁北专区组织了一千七百多干部深入虫区领导农民治虫，到七月五日止，该专区九个县已发动四万多人参加治虫工作，除治了四万一千多亩地的虫害，捕捉了六千二百多斤害虫，采摘了各种害虫卵块一千七百多斤，现已控制了虫害的蔓延。文水县西城乡四十四个互助组已将所有棉田普治一次到二次。长治专区最近还训练了七十多名除虫技术员，并制订了防治计划。目前各地已基本上制止了虫害蔓延。
