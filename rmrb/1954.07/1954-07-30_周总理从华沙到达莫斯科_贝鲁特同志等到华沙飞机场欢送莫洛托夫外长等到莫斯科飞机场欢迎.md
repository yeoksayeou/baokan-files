We know that peace is a good thing, but we also know that peace can only be achieved and guaranteed when it is defended by the powerful force of a liberated people.

Dear Premier Zhou Enlai, the words you spoke to the Polish people during your visit to our country demonstrate the support and friendship of the great Chinese people for the Polish people.
