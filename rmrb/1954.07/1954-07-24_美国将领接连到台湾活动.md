Xinhua News Agency, July 23rd: US generals have been continuously engaging in conspiratorial activities in Taiwan, which is under US occupation. Following the two-day activities of the commander of the US Thirteenth Air Force stationed in the Philippines, Sisers, who left Taiwan on the 18th, the newly appointed commander of the US Seventh Fleet's Task Force 72, Kivette, arrived in Taiwan on the 20th. In addition, according to a report by the United Press, the Thai authorities, who are colluding with the United States, will also send a military delegation on a so-called "goodwill mission" to Taiwan for activities in the near future. The news shows that these conspiratorial activities and arrangements by the United States are closely related to the United States' intensified criminal plan to use Taiwan as a base for aggression against China and a threat to peace and security in the Far East.

William, the commander of the US Tactical Air Force, openly clamored to reporters on the 19th that Taiwan is the "closest place" to attack the Chinese mainland.

    美国将领接连到台湾活动
    【新华社二十三日讯】美国将领接连到美国侵占下的台湾进行阴谋活动。在驻菲律宾的美国第十三航空队司令赛撒姆斯到台湾作两天活动在十八日离去后，新任美国第七舰队第七十二特遣舰队司令基维特又在二十日到台湾活动。另据合众社消息透露，正与美国勾结起来的泰国当局，最近期间也将派遣一个负有所谓“亲善的使命”的军事代表团到台湾去进行活动。消息说明美国的这些阴谋活动和布置，是和美国加紧把台湾作为侵略中国、威胁远东和平和安全的基地的罪恶计划密切有关的。
    美国战术空军司令威兰十九日公然对记者叫嚣，台湾是攻击中国大陆的“最近的一个地方”。
