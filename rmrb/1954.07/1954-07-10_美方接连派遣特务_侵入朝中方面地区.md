(Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, July 8) On July 6th, our troops stationed on the Yenan Peninsula captured two more US special agents who had intruded into our area to carry out hostile activities.

　　At about 4:00 am that day, our troops discovered two US special agents intruding into our area and immediately pursued them. The two agents attempted to flee south and were captured after our troops fired warning shots. Both US agents were wearing US military uniforms and carrying various forged documents. According to the two agents, their names were Kim Seok-hee and Bae Chang-hwan, and they were members of the special agent teams of the US Air Force 6006 Unit and 8240 Unit on Ganghwa Island.

　　We have repeatedly protested against the US side's serious violation of the armistice agreement. However, the US side has ignored this and continues to send large numbers of special agents to intrude into our area to carry out hostile activities. According to sources, from July 1st to July 6th, our side has captured US special agents intruding into our area at least four times. In addition to the above, the other three times are as follows: On the morning of July 1st, US agent Lee Jong-guk was captured southwest of Yenan. On July 2nd, female agent Oh Sun-hwa, dispatched by the Far East US Army Command's 8112 Unit and the City Dispatch Team, was captured in the Demilitarized Zone southeast of Panmunjom. On the afternoon of July 2nd, a US agent carrying various documents was captured in the Demilitarized Zone near Mundung-ri on the Eastern Front.

    美方接连派遣特务
    侵入朝中方面地区
    【新华社开城八日电】七月六日，驻延安半岛我军又捕获侵入我方地区进行敌对活动的美方特务两名。
    当天晨四时许，我驻军发现有两名美方特务侵入我方地区，当即予以追捕。这两名特务企图向南逃窜，在我驻军开枪警告后，才被我捕获。这两名美方特务都身穿美军服装，携有各种伪造的证件。据这两名特务供称，他们名叫金硕熙和裴昌焕，是江华岛美空军六零零六部队和八二四零部队特务队的人员。
    对美方的这种严重违反停战协定的行为，我方已经一再提出抗议。但是，美方仍然置之不顾，继续派遣大批特务侵入我方地区进行敌对活动。据记者从有关方面获悉，从七月一日到七月六日，我方至少有四次捕获侵入我方地区的美方特务。除上述的一次外，另外三次如下：七月一日晨，在延安西南捕获美方特务李钟国一名。七月二日，在板门店东南非军事区内捕获远东美军司令部八一一二部队和城市派遣队派遣来的女特务吴顺花一名。七月二日下午，在东线文登里附近非军事区内捕获携有各种证件的美方特务一名。
