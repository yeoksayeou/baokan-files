Comrade Ambassador, Comrades, Friends:
    Today is the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of Poland. Please allow me, on behalf of the Chinese people, to extend warm fraternal congratulations to the government and people of the People's Republic of Poland.
    Ten years ago today, the glorious Polish First Army and the heroic Soviet Army fought side by side, defeating the Hitler fascist army and liberating the first Polish city, Chelm, initiating the prelude to the liberation of all of Poland. Since then, the Polish people have freed themselves from the rule of landlords and capitalists, established a people's democratic system, and begun a new era in Polish history.
    For the past ten years, under the leadership of the Polish United Workers' Party and its long-tested leader, Comrade Bierut, the Polish people have victoriously carried out democratic reforms and socialist transformations. Through land reform and the nationalization of major economic sectors, they have shattered all conspiracies and sabotage by class enemies at home and abroad, achieved the unity of the working-class party, consolidated the worker-peasant alliance and the people's democratic system, and victoriously completed the three-year plan for restoring the national economy. This has laid a solid foundation for Poland to build socialism.
    Since the implementation of the Six-Year Plan for National Economic Development, Poland has entered a new era of building socialism. In terms of developing the national economy, Poland's total industrial output in 1953 had increased to 3.6 times that of 1938, or 4.8 times that of 1938 per capita. Total industrial output has surpassed Italy, and on a per capita basis, it is close to the level of France. In terms of production scale, Poland has risen to fifth place in Europe. In 1953, the output value of socialist industry accounted for 99 percent of the total industrial output. Therefore, Poland has basically completed the main task of socialist industrialization, transforming from an industrially backward country into an advanced socialist industrial country. Ocean-going ships, automobiles, tractors, synthetic fibers, giant machines needed for mining and smelting industries, etc., which Poland could not produce in the past, can now be produced domestically. The realization of socialist industrialization, the rapid development of industries that manufacture means of production on a new technical basis, has provided good conditions for further developing Poland's entire national economy and improving the people's living standards. National income in 1953 doubled that of 1938, and the production of consumer goods in 1953 doubled that of 1949.

    National industrialization has also had a great effect on the development of agriculture.
    In 1949, Poland's agricultural production, calculated per capita, had already exceeded the pre-war level, while in 1953, the total output of grain and livestock exceeded the pre-war level by 30 percent. The income of each farmer has increased by 75 percent compared to pre-war levels. Electricity is now used in 10,000 rural villages. The state has more than 45,000 tractors serving farmers nationwide. More than 200,000 farmers have joined over 8,000 agricultural production cooperatives.
    The development of Poland's foreign trade is also rapid. In 1953, Poland traded with 71 countries. The trade volume in 1954 more than doubled that of 1937. In the past, Poland's main exports were raw materials, semi-finished products, and bulk agricultural food products. Now, the export of industrial products, such as mining machinery, machine tools, locomotives, ships, and complete sets of machinery and equipment, is increasing year by year. Consumer goods and daily necessities are also increasing in imports.
    Comrades who have been to Poland have returned and said that Poland is now like a large-scale construction site, with thousands upon thousands of workers laboring everywhere, heroically building new coal mines, huge dikes and power stations, new factories and fishing bases, new residences and new urban areas. The scars of war are disappearing day by day. Warsaw, once barbarically destroyed by Nazi occupation forces, is now a metropolis with nearly a million people, with many monuments, large factories, schools, museums, theaters, squares... Warsaw proves to the world that the industrious, brave, and peace-loving Polish people have the determination and the power to build their own beautiful and happy homeland on the ruins caused by fascist bandits and on the land where countless revolutionary martyrs shed their blood. In this country, there is now no unemployment, no illiteracy, and 54 percent of the population enjoys social insurance. All school-age children are in school, there are 47 university students for every 10,000 people, and there is a library or book station for every 600 or so residents. There are over 100 theaters and over 3,000 urban and rural cinemas nationwide. Millions upon millions of working people enjoy the fruits of culture. In this country that gave birth to great geniuses such as Copernicus, Chopin, Mickiewicz, and Curie-Sk≈Çodowska, people see new, excellent literature, art, and science that serve socialist construction and world peace vigorously developing.
    The Polish Parliament passed the Constitution of the People's Republic of Poland on the eighth anniversary of the declaration issued by the Polish Committee of National Liberation. This constitution summarized the enormous changes in the lives of the Polish people in the first few years after the war. This constitution is built on the new national economy and the consolidated social forces. It demonstrates the power of the people's regime. The constitution consolidates the people's democratic system, guarantees the people's democratic rights and freedoms, and reflects the will of the Polish people to build socialism.
    The Polish people cherish peace. They not only work hard to build their own country for the cause of peace but also care about the struggles of people in other countries and actively support the cause of defending world peace. In the United Nations Organization, Poland, together with the entire peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, has continuously strived to push the United Nations Organization onto the track of a policy of peaceful cooperation among nations. At the Seventh United Nations General Assembly, the Polish delegation put forward positive, concrete proposals to ease international tensions, promoting the adoption of the resolution proposing a ceasefire in Korea. The efforts made by Poland and Czechoslovakia in the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission in Korea to uphold peace and justice have not only deeply moved the people of China and Korea but have also aroused the unanimous praise of just people around the world. The Polish people have consistently supported the patriotic movements of neighboring countries to strive for democracy, freedom, national independence, and peace, which has also inspired peace-loving people in Europe and around the world.
    In these short ten years, the Polish people, under the leadership of the Polish United Workers' Party, with the great assistance of the Soviet Union and the cooperation of other people's democratic countries, have achieved such great achievements in socialist construction and have made such outstanding contributions to the cause of safeguarding world peace, which has greatly inspired us, the Chinese people. We are proud of the great victory of Poland's ten years of construction. The victory of the Polish people is our own victory.
    Looking back, when the Chinese people's revolution was still in difficult and arduous times, the Polish people gave us deep sympathy and concern. The liberation of the Polish people encouraged the Chinese people who were then striving for liberation. As we celebrate the tenth anniversary of Poland's liberation today, let us review with great pleasure the road of rapid development of friendship between our two peoples over the past four years. For more than four years, we have fixed most aspects of friendly cooperation between the two countries in cultural, trade, broadcasting, and other cooperation agreements through written provisions. The trade volume has been increasing every year. Cultural exchanges have also become increasingly extensive and expanded. From 1950 to the end of 1953, our two countries exchanged a total of 44 delegations of various kinds, greatly enhancing the fraternal friendship between the two peoples. The outstanding artistic performances of the young artists of the Mazowsze Song and Dance Ensemble have left a deep impression on the broad masses of the Chinese people. The "Economic Exhibition of the People's Republic of Poland" gave great encouragement to the Chinese people who were beginning to carry out planned economic construction. The electro-petrification method of Polish scientist Cyprian Dolivo-Dobrovolsky has become an important subject of study in China's construction industry. The agreement on technological and technical-scientific cooperation to be signed soon in Warsaw will further develop the cooperation between the two countries in science, giving the Chinese people a better opportunity to learn Polish science and technology. These examples all illustrate the increasing development and consolidation of friendship between the Chinese and Polish peoples. The friendly cooperation between the two peoples in various fields has promoted the socialist construction of the two countries and achieved the sincere desire for common economic prosperity.
    Let us cheer for the close unity of the Chinese and Polish people with the Soviet Union, for the close unity of our entire peace and democracy camp family headed by the Soviet Union, and for the great victories we have achieved in the common cause of defending world peace! Let the people of China and Poland, the people of all countries in the entire peace and democracy camp, and peace-loving people all over the world unite more closely and make greater contributions to the cause of peace, democracy, and socialism!
    Long live the increasingly consolidated and developing fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Polish peoples!
    Long live the unbreakable friendship and unity of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union!
    Thanks to the Soviet Union's fraternal assistance, providing us with patent licenses and technical data, and giving us great assistance in technology, we have been able to build Nowa Huta, Zilan, Czƒôstochowa Iron and Steel Plant, Daizhou and other large factories.
    The magnificent gift from the Soviet people to the Polish capital Warsaw ‚Äì the Palace of Culture and Science ‚Äì proves the Soviet Union's selfless assistance to Poland. This is the most magnificent monument to friendship and a concrete manifestation of the fraternal relations between Poland and the Soviet Union.
    Comrade Boles≈Çaw Bierut said when talking about Polish-Soviet relations: "The friendship, assistance, and example of the Soviet Union are the main source of our victory."
    Recently, the Party and the government have concentrated their main efforts on agricultural production, aiming to use the ever-increasing strength and funds to promote the achievements of the country's socialist industrialization and further tap the huge potential of our agricultural economy ‚Äì to ensure that every piece of land is cultivated so that the living standards of the working people can continue to improve.
    In recent years, the cooperative movement has been widely launched in rural areas, and more than 200,000 farmers have participated in more than 8,000 agricultural production cooperatives.
    Over the past ten years, there have also been great changes in the socio-cultural aspects, which are reflected in the various benefits given to the working people by the labor law and social insurance, as well as the development of culture, education, science, and literary and artistic creation.
    Our efforts and achievements in socialist construction are the most important guarantee for the ever-increasing strength of the people's country and the unity and prosperity of our motherland.
    An eternal, unbreakable connection and friendship have closely united Poland with the great Soviet Union, People's China, the people's democratic countries, and all peace-loving people.
    Poland supports with sincerity and enthusiasm the Soviet Union's policy of easing international tensions and defending peace. We heard with warmth and excitement the news that peace had triumphed over aggression, justice had triumphed over power, and that the Soviet Union had built the world's first atomic energy power station. The greatest scientific invention of our time ‚Äì atomic energy ‚Äì has been used for the benefit of mankind. This fact fully demonstrates the Soviet government's peaceful policy and the service of modern science to the interests of the broad masses of the people.
    The Polish and Chinese people are united by deep friendship and close cooperation. The Polish working class is excited, concerned, and gives spiritual support to the Chinese people's long-term and heroic struggle for national and social liberation under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the brilliant leader Mao Zedong.
    Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, despite the great distance between our two countries, our political, economic, and cultural ties have been strengthened.
    Trade and economic cooperation between our two countries are growing year by year, which makes a great contribution to the realization of Poland's and China's economic plans and the promotion of the welfare of the people of both countries.
    Cultural relations between Poland and China are becoming closer day by day: the visits of scientific and cultural workers, the dispatch of literary and artistic groups, the screening of films, the exchange of students, the spread of national music, the translation of political, social, and literary publications, especially the translation of Mao Zedong's works into Polish, are becoming more and more numerous ‚Äì this is just a small part; as time goes by, we will unite more closely.
    We are just as happy as you are about your draft constitution, which reflects the great social reforms resulting from the victory of the revolution and the founding of the People's Republic of China. We share with you the noble sense of responsibility of your citizens. Every citizen of your country is participating in a truly free election for the first time in Chinese history.
    Our people see with joy and concern that the international status and prestige of People's China have been greatly improved.
    The People's Republic of China's participation in the Geneva Conference as a major power, its primary task in the peaceful settlement of the Korean and Vietnamese issues, the visits of well-known Western politicians to Premier Zhou Enlai, and Premier Zhou's talks in Delhi and Yangon ‚Äì all these prove that China's status and prestige have been greatly improved.
    The five principles stipulated by Prime Ministers Nehru and Zhou Enlai in their joint statement, which will be the basis for establishing friendly relations between India and the People's Republic of China, are welcomed by all peace-loving people, and are not only a guarantee for the development of friendly relations between China and India but also a method for solving all international problems.
    In the Western bourgeois group, they are gradually realizing a clear fact: the time when China was only an object of imperialist world policy has passed; today, whether anyone likes it or not, no international problem can be solved without the participation of the People's Republic of China, which has 600 million people.
    The reactionary forces headed by the United States refuse to ease international tensions in any way. The establishment of various aggressive groups, the mad arms race, the expansion of American war bases in Europe, Africa, and Asia, and the revival of German and Japanese aggressive armed forces ‚Äì these are their policies of plunder, instigating war, and oppressing other countries.
    However, people do not need war, and they show that they have the strength to defend peace. The movement of tens of thousands of peace defenders illustrates this, and representatives of all classes and strata participate in this movement, not only in the new democratic countries but also in the capitalist countries. Another proof is that the people of Asia have gradually realized their own importance and strength, and the Chinese people have set an example for them in the struggle to get rid of the shackles of colonialism.
    The unbreakable friendship and unity between the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, the People's Republic of Poland, and all the people's democratic countries is the unshakable foundation of the peace and democracy camp and the peaceful fortress in the world that defends the freedom and sovereignty of all nations.
    Long live the fraternal friendship and unity between China and Poland!
    Long live the invincible camp of democracy and socialism headed by the Soviet Union!
    May the peace fortress in the Far East, the great People's Republic of China, become increasingly prosperous!
    Long live Comrade Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people and friend of the Polish people!
