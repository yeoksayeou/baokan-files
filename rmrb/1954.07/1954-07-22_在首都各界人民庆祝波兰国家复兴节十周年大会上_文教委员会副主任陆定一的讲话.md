Comrade Ambassador, Comrades, Friends:
    Today is the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of Poland. Please allow me, on behalf of the Chinese people, to extend warm fraternal congratulations to the government and people of the People's Republic of Poland.
    Ten years ago today, the glorious Polish First Army and the heroic Soviet Army fought side by side, defeating the Hitler fascist army and liberating the first Polish city, Chelm, initiating the prelude to the liberation of all of Poland. Since then, the Polish people have freed themselves from the rule of landlords and capitalists, established a people's democratic system, and begun a new era in Polish history.
    For the past ten years, under the leadership of the Polish United Workers' Party and its long-tested leader, Comrade Bierut, the Polish people have victoriously carried out democratic reforms and socialist transformations. Through land reform and the nationalization of major economic sectors, they have shattered all conspiracies and sabotage by class enemies at home and abroad, achieved the unity of the working-class party, consolidated the worker-peasant alliance and the people's democratic system, and victoriously completed the three-year plan for restoring the national economy. This has laid a solid foundation for Poland to build socialism.
    Since the implementation of the Six-Year Plan for National Economic Development, Poland has entered a new era of building socialism. In terms of developing the national economy, Poland's total industrial output in 1953 had increased to 3.6 times that of 1938, or 4.8 times that of 1938 per capita. Total industrial output has surpassed Italy, and on a per capita basis, it is close to the level of France. In terms of production scale, Poland has risen to fifth place in Europe. In 1953, the output value of socialist industry accounted for 99 percent of the total industrial output. Therefore, Poland has basically completed the main task of socialist industrialization, transforming from an industrially backward country into an advanced socialist industrial country. Ocean-going ships, automobiles, tractors, synthetic fibers, giant machines needed for mining and smelting industries, etc., which Poland could not produce in the past, can now be produced domestically. The realization of socialist industrialization, the rapid development of industries that manufacture means of production on a new technical basis, has provided good conditions for further developing Poland's entire national economy and improving the people's living standards. National income in 1953 doubled that of 1938, and the production of consumer goods in 1953 doubled that of 1949.

    National industrialization has also had a great effect on the development of agriculture.
    In 1949, Poland's agricultural production, calculated per capita, had already exceeded the pre-war level, while in 1953, the total output of grain and livestock exceeded the pre-war level by 30 percent. The income of each farmer has increased by 75 percent compared to pre-war levels. Electricity is now used in 10,000 rural villages. The state has more than 45,000 tractors serving farmers nationwide. More than 200,000 farmers have joined over 8,000 agricultural production cooperatives.
    The development of Poland's foreign trade is also rapid. In 1953, Poland traded with 71 countries. The trade volume in 1954 more than doubled that of 1937. In the past, Poland's main exports were raw materials, semi-finished products, and bulk agricultural food products. Now, the export of industrial products, such as mining machinery, machine tools, locomotives, ships, and complete sets of machinery and equipment, is increasing year by year. Consumer goods and daily necessities are also increasing in imports.
    Comrades who have been to Poland have returned and said that Poland is now like a large-scale construction site, with thousands upon thousands of workers laboring everywhere, heroically building new coal mines, huge dikes and power stations, new factories and fishing bases, new residences and new urban areas. The scars of war are disappearing day by day. Warsaw, once barbarically destroyed by Nazi occupation forces, is now a metropolis with nearly a million people, with many monuments, large factories, schools, museums, theaters, squares... Warsaw proves to the world that the industrious, brave, and peace-loving Polish people have the determination and the power to build their own beautiful and happy homeland on the ruins caused by fascist bandits and on the land where countless revolutionary martyrs shed their blood. In this country, there is now no unemployment, no illiteracy, and 54 percent of the population enjoys social insurance. All school-age children are in school, there are 47 university students for every 10,000 people, and there is a library or book station for every 600 or so residents. There are over 100 theaters and over 3,000 urban and rural cinemas nationwide. Millions upon millions of working people enjoy the fruits of culture. In this country that gave birth to great geniuses such as Copernicus, Chopin, Mickiewicz, and Curie-Skłodowska, people see new, excellent literature, art, and science that serve socialist construction and world peace vigorously developing.
    The Polish Parliament passed the Constitution of the People's Republic of Poland on the eighth anniversary of the declaration issued by the Polish Committee of National Liberation. This constitution summarized the enormous changes in the lives of the Polish people in the first few years after the war. This constitution is built on the new national economy and the consolidated social forces. It demonstrates the power of the people's regime. The constitution consolidates the people's democratic system, guarantees the people's democratic rights and freedoms, and reflects the will of the Polish people to build socialism.
    The Polish people cherish peace. They not only work hard to build their own country for the cause of peace but also care about the struggles of people in other countries and actively support the cause of defending world peace. In the United Nations Organization, Poland, together with the entire peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, has continuously strived to push the United Nations Organization onto the track of a policy of peaceful cooperation among nations. At the Seventh United Nations General Assembly, the Polish delegation put forward positive, concrete proposals to ease international tensions, promoting the adoption of the resolution proposing a ceasefire in Korea. The efforts made by Poland and Czechoslovakia in the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission in Korea to uphold peace and justice have not only deeply moved the people of China and Korea but have also aroused the unanimous praise of just people around the world. The Polish people have consistently supported the patriotic movements of neighboring countries to strive for democracy, freedom, national independence, and peace, which has also inspired peace-loving people in Europe and around the world.
    In these short ten years, the Polish people, under the leadership of the Polish United Workers' Party, with the great assistance of the Soviet Union and the cooperation of other people's democratic countries, have achieved such great achievements in socialist construction and have made such outstanding contributions to the cause of safeguarding world peace, which has greatly inspired us, the Chinese people. We are proud of the great victory of Poland's ten years of construction. The victory of the Polish people is our own victory.
    Looking back, when the Chinese people's revolution was still in difficult and arduous times, the Polish people gave us deep sympathy and concern. The liberation of the Polish people encouraged the Chinese people who were then striving for liberation. As we celebrate the tenth anniversary of Poland's liberation today, let us review with great pleasure the road of rapid development of friendship between our two peoples over the past four years. For more than four years, we have fixed most aspects of friendly cooperation between the two countries in cultural, trade, broadcasting, and other cooperation agreements through written provisions. The trade volume has been increasing every year. Cultural exchanges have also become increasingly extensive and expanded. From 1950 to the end of 1953, our two countries exchanged a total of 44 delegations of various kinds, greatly enhancing the fraternal friendship between the two peoples. The outstanding artistic performances of the young artists of the Mazowsze Song and Dance Ensemble have left a deep impression on the broad masses of the Chinese people. The "Economic Exhibition of the People's Republic of Poland" gave great encouragement to the Chinese people who were beginning to carry out planned economic construction. The electro-petrification method of Polish scientist Cyprian Dolivo-Dobrovolsky has become an important subject of study in China's construction industry. The agreement on technological and technical-scientific cooperation to be signed soon in Warsaw will further develop the cooperation between the two countries in science, giving the Chinese people a better opportunity to learn Polish science and technology. These examples all illustrate the increasing development and consolidation of friendship between the Chinese and Polish peoples. The friendly cooperation between the two peoples in various fields has promoted the socialist construction of the two countries and achieved the sincere desire for common economic prosperity.
    Let us cheer for the close unity of the Chinese and Polish people with the Soviet Union, for the close unity of our entire peace and democracy camp family headed by the Soviet Union, and for the great victories we have achieved in the common cause of defending world peace! Let the people of China and Poland, the people of all countries in the entire peace and democracy camp, and peace-loving people all over the world unite more closely and make greater contributions to the cause of peace, democracy, and socialism!
    Long live the increasingly consolidated and developing fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Polish peoples!
    Long live the unbreakable friendship and unity of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union!
    Thanks to the Soviet Union's fraternal assistance, providing us with patent licenses and technical data, and giving us great assistance in technology, we have been able to build Nowa Huta, Zilan, Częstochowa Iron and Steel Plant, Daizhou and other large factories.
    The magnificent gift from the Soviet people to the Polish capital Warsaw – the Palace of Culture and Science – proves the Soviet Union's selfless assistance to Poland. This is the most magnificent monument to friendship and a concrete manifestation of the fraternal relations between Poland and the Soviet Union.
    Comrade Bolesław Bierut said when talking about Polish-Soviet relations: "The friendship, assistance, and example of the Soviet Union are the main source of our victory."
    Recently, the Party and the government have concentrated their main efforts on agricultural production, aiming to use the ever-increasing strength and funds to promote the achievements of the country's socialist industrialization and further tap the huge potential of our agricultural economy – to ensure that every piece of land is cultivated so that the living standards of the working people can continue to improve.
    In recent years, the cooperative movement has been widely launched in rural areas, and more than 200,000 farmers have participated in more than 8,000 agricultural production cooperatives.
    Over the past ten years, there have also been great changes in the socio-cultural aspects, which are reflected in the various benefits given to the working people by the labor law and social insurance, as well as the development of culture, education, science, and literary and artistic creation.
    Our efforts and achievements in socialist construction are the most important guarantee for the ever-increasing strength of the people's country and the unity and prosperity of our motherland.
    An eternal, unbreakable connection and friendship have closely united Poland with the great Soviet Union, People's China, the people's democratic countries, and all peace-loving people.
    Poland supports with sincerity and enthusiasm the Soviet Union's policy of easing international tensions and defending peace. We heard with warmth and excitement the news that peace had triumphed over aggression, justice had triumphed over power, and that the Soviet Union had built the world's first atomic energy power station. The greatest scientific invention of our time – atomic energy – has been used for the benefit of mankind. This fact fully demonstrates the Soviet government's peaceful policy and the service of modern science to the interests of the broad masses of the people.
    The Polish and Chinese people are united by deep friendship and close cooperation. The Polish working class is excited, concerned, and gives spiritual support to the Chinese people's long-term and heroic struggle for national and social liberation under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the brilliant leader Mao Zedong.
    Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, despite the great distance between our two countries, our political, economic, and cultural ties have been strengthened.
    Trade and economic cooperation between our two countries are growing year by year, which makes a great contribution to the realization of Poland's and China's economic plans and the promotion of the welfare of the people of both countries.
    Cultural relations between Poland and China are becoming closer day by day: the visits of scientific and cultural workers, the dispatch of literary and artistic groups, the screening of films, the exchange of students, the spread of national music, the translation of political, social, and literary publications, especially the translation of Mao Zedong's works into Polish, are becoming more and more numerous – this is just a small part; as time goes by, we will unite more closely.
    We are just as happy as you are about your draft constitution, which reflects the great social reforms resulting from the victory of the revolution and the founding of the People's Republic of China. We share with you the noble sense of responsibility of your citizens. Every citizen of your country is participating in a truly free election for the first time in Chinese history.
    Our people see with joy and concern that the international status and prestige of People's China have been greatly improved.
    The People's Republic of China's participation in the Geneva Conference as a major power, its primary task in the peaceful settlement of the Korean and Vietnamese issues, the visits of well-known Western politicians to Premier Zhou Enlai, and Premier Zhou's talks in Delhi and Yangon – all these prove that China's status and prestige have been greatly improved.
    The five principles stipulated by Prime Ministers Nehru and Zhou Enlai in their joint statement, which will be the basis for establishing friendly relations between India and the People's Republic of China, are welcomed by all peace-loving people, and are not only a guarantee for the development of friendly relations between China and India but also a method for solving all international problems.
    In the Western bourgeois group, they are gradually realizing a clear fact: the time when China was only an object of imperialist world policy has passed; today, whether anyone likes it or not, no international problem can be solved without the participation of the People's Republic of China, which has 600 million people.
    The reactionary forces headed by the United States refuse to ease international tensions in any way. The establishment of various aggressive groups, the mad arms race, the expansion of American war bases in Europe, Africa, and Asia, and the revival of German and Japanese aggressive armed forces – these are their policies of plunder, instigating war, and oppressing other countries.
    However, people do not need war, and they show that they have the strength to defend peace. The movement of tens of thousands of peace defenders illustrates this, and representatives of all classes and strata participate in this movement, not only in the new democratic countries but also in the capitalist countries. Another proof is that the people of Asia have gradually realized their own importance and strength, and the Chinese people have set an example for them in the struggle to get rid of the shackles of colonialism.
    The unbreakable friendship and unity between the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, the People's Republic of Poland, and all the people's democratic countries is the unshakable foundation of the peace and democracy camp and the peaceful fortress in the world that defends the freedom and sovereignty of all nations.
    Long live the fraternal friendship and unity between China and Poland!
    Long live the invincible camp of democracy and socialism headed by the Soviet Union!
    May the peace fortress in the Far East, the great People's Republic of China, become increasingly prosperous!
    Long live Comrade Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people and friend of the Polish people!

    在首都各界人民庆祝波兰国家复兴节十周年大会上
    文教委员会副主任陆定一的讲话大使同志、各位同志、各位朋友：
    今天是波兰人民共和国成立十周年纪念日，请允许我以中国人民的名义向波兰人民共和国政府和人民致以热烈的兄弟的祝贺。
    十年前的今天，光荣的波兰第一军和英雄的苏联军队并肩作战，击溃了希特勒法西斯军队，解放了波兰第一个城市海尔姆，揭起了解放全波兰的序幕，从此，波兰人民摆脱了地主资产阶级的统治，建立起人民民主的制度，在波兰历史上开始了新的纪元。
    十年以来，波兰人民在波兰统一工人党和自己久经考验的领袖贝鲁特同志的领导下，胜利地进行了民主改革与社会主义的改造。经过土地改革和主要经济部门的国有化，粉碎了国内外阶级敌人的一切阴谋破坏，实现了工人阶级政党的统一，巩固了工农联盟与人民民主制度，胜利地完成了恢复国民经济的三年计划。这样就为波兰建设社会主义奠定了稳固的基础。
    自从开始执行国民经济六年计划以来，波兰已经进入了建设社会主义的新的时期。在发展国民经济方面，一九五三年波兰工业总产量已增加为一九三八年的三点六倍，若以每一人口计算，则为一九三八年的四点八倍。工业总产量已超过意大利，按人口平均计算，则接近于法国的水平。就生产规模而论，波兰已上升至欧洲的第五位。一九五三年，社会主义工业产值占工业总产值的百分之九十九，因此，波兰基本上已完成了社会主义工业化的主要任务，从工业落后国家变为一个先进的社会主义的工业国了。过去波兰不能生产的远洋轮船、汽车、拖拉机、合成纤维、采矿和冶炼工业所需的巨型机器等等，现在都能自己生产了。社会主义工业化的实现，制造生产资料的工业在新的技术基础上的迅速发展，已为进一步发展波兰的整个国民经济和提高人民生活水平提供了良好的条件。一九五三年国民收入比一九三八年增加了一倍，消费资料的生产，一九五三年比一九四九年增加了一倍。
    国家工业化对农业的发展也已收到很大效果。
    一九四九年波兰的农业生产量，按每一人口计算，已经超过了战前的水平，而一九五三年谷物和牲畜的总产量则超过战前水平的百分之三十。每一农民的收入比战前增加百分之七十五。现在已经有一万个农村使用电力。国家有四万五千多部拖拉机为全国农民服务。有二十多万农民参加在八千多个农业生产合作社里。
    波兰对外贸易的发展也是迅速的。一九五三年波兰和七十一个国家进行了贸易。一九五四年的贸易额比一九三七年增加了一倍多。波兰出口货，过去主要的是原料和半制成品、大宗的农业食品。现在，工业制品，如采矿机器、工作母机、火车机车、轮船以及全套机器设备的出口逐年增加了。进口货中消费品、日用必需品也日益增加了。
    到过波兰的同志们回来说，波兰现在像一个大规模的建筑工地，到处是成千上万的工人在劳动，他们正在英勇地建设着新的煤矿、巨大的水堤和发电站、新的工厂与捕鱼基地、新的住宅和新的市区。战争的创痕一天天在消失，曾经遭受纳粹占领军野蛮破坏的华沙，今天已是一个拥有近百万人口的都市，市内有许多纪念物、大工厂、学校、博物馆、剧院、广场……。华沙向全世界证明，勤劳、勇敢、热爱和平的波兰人民有决心也有力量在法西斯强盗所造成的废墟上，在无数革命先烈流过鲜血的土地上建立起自己的美丽幸福的家园。在这个国度里，现在已经没有失业，没有文盲，全国百分之五十四的人口享受着社会保险。所有的学龄儿童都上了学，每一万个人中，就有四十七个大学生，每六百多个居民中就有一个图书馆或图书站，全国有一百多个剧院，有三千多个城乡电影院。千千万万的劳动人民享受到了文化果实。在这个诞生过伟大天才哥白尼、萧邦、密茨凯维奇、居里·斯克多夫斯卡的国度里，人们看到了新的、为社会主义建设与世界和平服务的优秀的文学、艺术、科学正在蓬勃地发展。
    波兰议会在波兰民族解放委员会发布宣言的八周年的那一天，通过了波兰人民共和国宪法。这部宪法总结了波兰人民生活在战后头几年里的巨大改变情况。这部宪法是建筑在新的国民经济和巩固了的社会力量之上的。它显示了人民政权的力量。宪法巩固了人民民主制度，保证了人民的民主权利与自由，反映了波兰人民建设社会主义的意志。
    波兰人民酷爱和平。他们不但为和平事业而努力建设着自己的祖国，并且关心着各国人民的斗争，积极支持了保卫世界和平的事业。波兰在联合国组织中，和以苏联为首的整个和平民主阵营一道，不断地努力于把联合国组织推向各国和平合作政策的轨道。在第七届联合国大会上，波兰代表团提出了积极的、具体的、争取缓和国际紧张局势的建议，推动了建议朝鲜停火的决议的通过。波兰、捷克斯洛伐克在朝鲜的中立国监察委员会和中立国遣返委员会中，为维护和平与正义所作的努力，不仅使中朝两国人民深深感动，而且引起了全世界正义人士的同声赞扬。波兰人民一贯支持邻邦人民争取民主自由、民族独立与和平的爱国运动，这也鼓舞了欧洲和全世界爱好和平的人民。
    在这短短的十年中，波兰人民在波兰统一工人党的领导下，在苏联的伟大援助和其他人民民主国家的合作下，在社会主义建设中获得了这样巨大的成就，在维护世界和平的事业上又作了这样卓越的贡献，使我们中国人民受到莫大的鼓舞。我们为波兰人民十年建设的伟大胜利而感到骄傲。波兰人民的胜利就是我们自己的胜利。
    回顾我们中国人民革命尚在艰难困苦的时候，波兰人民曾给了我们深切的同情与关怀。波兰人民的解放，鼓舞了当时正在争取解放斗争中的中国人民。当我们庆祝波兰解放十周年的今天，让我们怀着十分愉快的心情来回顾一下四年多以来我们两国人民之间的友谊迅速发展的道路。四年多来，我们在文化、贸易、广播等合作协定中把两国之间在各方面的友好合作大部分用条文固定下来了。贸易额每年都在增涨。文化交流也日益广泛和扩大。从一九五○年到一九五三年底我们两国互相来往的各种代表团计四十四起，大大地增进了两国人民兄弟般的友谊。玛佐夫舍歌舞团的青年艺术家们卓越的艺术表演，在中国广大人民中留下了深刻的印象。“波兰人民共和国经济展览会”给予开始进行有计划的经济建设的中国人民以很大的鼓励。波兰科学家蔡白尔多维赤的电动石化法已经成为中国建筑工业上重要的学习课题。不久即将在华沙签订的技术与技术科学合作协定又将进一步发展两国在科学上的合作，使中国人民得有更好的机会学习波兰的科学技术。这些事例，都说明了中波两国人民之间友谊的日益发展和巩固，两国人民，在各方面的友好合作推动了两国的社会主义建设，并达到了共同经济高涨的真诚愿望。
    让我们为中波两国人民同苏联的紧密团结，为我们以苏联为首的整个和平民主阵营大家庭的紧密团结，为我们在保卫世界和平的共同事业中所取得的伟大胜利而欢呼吧！让中波两国人民、整个和平民主阵营各国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民更加紧密地团结起来，为和平、民主和社会主义事业作出更大贡献吧！
    中波两国人民日益巩固与发展的兄弟般的友谊万岁！
    以苏联为首的和平民主阵营的牢不可破的友谊与团结万岁！
    由于苏联兄弟般的援助，供给我们专利权许可证和技术资料，并在技术方面给我们莫大的协助，使我们能够建立诺瓦胡塔、纪兰、成斯托科发制铁厂、代州及其他的大工厂。
    苏联人民赠给波兰首都华沙的隆重的礼物——斯大林文化科学宫，可以证明苏联对波兰的无私的援助。这是友谊的最瑰丽的纪念物，是波苏两国兄弟关系的具体表现。
    波莱斯瓦夫·贝鲁特同志谈到波苏的关系时曾说：“苏联的友谊、援助和先例是我们胜利的主要源泉。”
    最近党和政府集中主要力量从事农业生产，目的在于运用日益增长的力量和资金以发扬国家社会主义工业化的成果，进一步挖掘我国农业经济巨大的潜在力量——务使每一块土地都耕种起来，使劳动人民的生活水平能够不断提高。
    最近几年来，合作运动在农村中已经广泛地展开，已经有二十余万农民参加了八千多个农业生产合作社。
    十年来，在社会文化方面也有了很大的改变，这表现在劳动法和社会保险所给予劳动人民的种种利益，以及文化、教育、科学和文艺创作方面的发展。
    我们在社会主义建设中的努力和成就，是人民国家日益强大以及我们祖国的团结和繁荣最重要的保证。
    　永恒的、牢不可破的联系和友谊，已使波兰和伟大的苏联、人民中国、人民民主国家以及一切爱好和平的人民紧紧团结在一起。
    波兰满怀着真诚和热忱，支持苏联缓和国际紧张局势、保卫和平的政策。我们以热烈和兴奋的情绪，听到和平战胜了侵略、公理战胜了强权、以及苏联建成了世界第一个原子能电力站的消息。在我们这个时代最大的科学发明——原子能，已经用之于为人类谋福利的事业。这个事实充分地显示出苏联政府的和平政策，使现代科学为广大人民利益而服务。
    波兰人民和中国人民是在深挚的友谊和密切的合作下团结在一起的。中国人民在中国共产党和天才的领袖毛泽东领导下，为求得民族和社会的解放，进行长时期的英勇的斗争，波兰工人阶级对此感到兴奋、关怀，并且给了精神上的支持。
    自从中华人民共和国成立后，尽管我们两国相距万里之远，我们在政治、经济和文化方面的联系已巩固起来了。
    我们两国间的贸易和经济合作正在逐年增长，这对于实现波兰和中国经济计划，促进两国人民的福利都有很大的贡献。
    波中的文化关系一天天密切起来了：科学文化工作者的访问，文艺工作团的派遣，影片的放映，留学生的交换，民族音乐的传播，政治、社会和文学方面出版物的翻译，尤其是毛泽东著作的译为波兰文，是愈来愈多了——这还仅仅是一小部分；随着时光的前进，我们会团结得更紧。
    贵国的宪法草案反映了革命胜利和中华人民共和国成立后所产生的伟大的社会改革，我们对此和你们同样地感到高兴。我们和你们共同体会到贵国公民所具有的崇高的责任感。贵国每一公民都是在中国历史上第一次参加真正的自由选举。
    我们的人民以欢喜和关怀的心情，看到人民中国的国际地位和威信大大地提高起来。
    中华人民共和国之以一个大国的身份参加日内瓦会议，它对朝鲜和越南问题的和平解决所承担的主要的任务，西方知名的政治家的访问周恩来总理，以及周总理在德里和仰光的会谈——这一切都证明中国的地位和威望已大大的提高了。
    尼赫鲁总理和周恩来总理在联合声明中规定了五项原则，这将是印度和中华人民共和国之间建立友好关系的基础；这个声明是一切爱好和平的人们所欢迎的，它不仅是中印两国友好关系发展的保证，同时也是解决一切国际问题的方法。
    在西方资产阶级集团中，他们渐渐明了一个显明的事实，即中国只是帝国主义世界政策的一个对象的时候已经过去了；今天，不管谁喜欢不喜欢，任何国际问题如果没有拥有六亿人口的中华人民共和国参加，是无法获得解决的。
    以美国为首的反动势力，拒绝以任何方式来缓和国际紧张局势。各种侵略集团的建立，疯狂的军备竞赛，美国在欧洲、非洲、和亚洲各国的战争基地的扩展，以及德国、日本侵略武装的复活——这些就是他们掠夺、挑拨战争、压迫别的国家的政策。
    然而，人们并不需要战争，他们表示出有力量来保卫和平。成千成万的和平保卫者的运动说明了这一点，不仅在新的民主国家，而且在资本主义国家都有各阶层和各阶级的代表参加这一运动。还有一个证明，就是亚洲人民已经逐渐意识到他们自己的重要和力量，中国人民在摆脱殖民主义的枷锁的斗争中，给他们树立了一个榜样。
    苏联、中华人民共和国、波兰人民共和国和所有人民民主国家之间牢不可破的友谊和团结，是和平民主阵营不可动摇的基础，是世界上保卫各民族自由和主权的和平堡垒。
    中波两国的兄弟友谊和团结万岁！
    以苏联为首的不可战胜的民主和社会主义的阵营万岁！
    愿远东的和平堡垒、伟大的中华人民共和国日益繁荣！
    中国人民伟大的领袖、波兰人民的朋友毛泽东同志万岁！
