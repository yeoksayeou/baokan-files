Further Study, Promotion and Discussion of the Draft Constitution
    The State Gradually Expands the Material Conditions for Workers' Rest and Recuperation
    Caring and Cultivating

    Mu Qingxiang, the head of the general affairs section of the Shenyang Electrical Machinery Plant, has repeatedly studied the draft constitution. The more he read it, the more he felt that every article of this draft constitution conforms to the people's wishes. More than a decade ago, Mu Qingxiang was tricked and sold by a local tyrant foreman from Shandong to a coal mine in Northeast China to work as a laborer. At that time, he only earned half a kilogram of rotten ground beans a day, and had to feed his three- or four-year-old child first. His wife went out begging for food every day. After the Japanese devils were driven away, the Kuomintang bandits came, and he went to work as a carpenter in an electrical appliance factory in Shenyang. Due to overwork, he became seriously ill, and had to rest for a while every time he worked, so he was kicked out of the factory. His illness became more and more serious, and he couldn't get out of bed. He had to rely on his wife begging for food to support the family. His wife didn't eat the little food she got, only giving it to the children and the sick man. Over time, his wife starved to death. At that time, he simply couldn't go on living. With tears in his eyes, he wanted to put his five-year-old child in a sack and throw him into the river, and then drink brine to commit suicide himself. After discovering this, the neighbor, Granny Wang, saved the lives of the father and son.

    After the liberation of Shenyang, he went to the original factory to report with his illness, thinking that reporting would be in vain, and they would definitely not want him because he was sick. When he arrived at the factory, he told the responsible comrade about his condition, and the factory kept him. After working for twenty-odd days, to his surprise, the factory introduced him to the hospital for treatment. His illness was cured, and the organization took care of him and assigned him light work. Later, the factory cultivated him and made him an administrative cadre, serving as the head of the general affairs section. He said: Now that I think about it, without the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, I would definitely not be where I am today. The draft constitution stipulates that workers have the right to rest, as well as various other rights. I can only do my job well, complete the tasks given to me by the Party and the people, and support the draft constitution with practical actions.

    A Stevedore's Confession

    Song Xishui, an old stevedore receiving treatment at the Dalian Seaport Hospital, wanted to sit up and write a letter to thank the doctors and nurses at the hospital as soon as his illness improved a little. Every time he saw the doctors visiting patients in the ward on Sundays, the nurses covering patients with blankets late at night, or the nurses feeding patients spoonful by spoonful, he felt an unspeakable excitement in his heart. In a letter he wrote on June 30, he said: When I was admitted to the hospital, I was very ill and unconscious. After the doctor's careful treatment, I can now walk.

    This kind of concern for laborers in the new society naturally made him think of the past.

    Song Xishui has been in the stevedoring business for some time. During the Japanese occupation, he once suffered from typhoid fever and was driven by the Japanese devils into the "Chinese Labor Medical Clinic" at that time. This medical clinic was like the Yama's palace. Old Song was too sick to walk, so he urinated into the spittoon. After being discovered by the Japanese, he was beaten half to death. Some people's illnesses were not serious, but because the Japanese doctors wanted to learn their craft, they used Chinese people as guinea pigs and performed surgery at will, resulting in many people becoming disabled. Wang Chuntian's arm was cut off in this way. Many people were not seriously ill, but the Japanese insisted that they were dying and dragged them out of the ward. They said: "We can still live, please don't throw us away!" When the Japanese heard this, they cursed angrily: You are dying soon, and you are still talking! In this way, some people were buried alive. There were a total of four people in Song Xishui's ward, and all three of them were tortured to death by the Japanese except for him.

    Recently, after hearing people tell him about the draft constitution, Song Xishui learned that workers have the right to material assistance when they are old, sick, or have lost their ability to work. He said with emotion that the new society has truly achieved this. Taking the Seaport Hospital as an example: the doctors are not only considerate to the patients in the hospital, asking about their temperature and comfort, but also very serious and careful when seeing patients in the outpatient department, and they are very considerate to the patients. In order to prevent patients from waiting too long when registering, they have adopted a reservation treatment method; they also implement agreed-upon prescriptions, and patients can get their medicine in just two minutes after the doctor prescribes it. In addition to this, the hospital also has an outpatient department at the dock, so patients can see a doctor at any time if they are sick, without having to run a long way to the hospital.

    Song Xishui said that he must work harder after he recovers.

    Salt Worker Yang Quanzhi's Experience

    Yang Quanzhi is a model worker in the Guanxi Salt Field of the Huaibei Saltworks. After studying the draft constitution, he made a comparison of two situations he had personally experienced.

    He said that before liberation, when he was nineteen years old, he suffered from typhoid fever. His family had nothing to eat, let alone money to see a doctor. He slept in bed for seven days, and his body had not yet recovered, but the hateful boss forced him to get up and carry salt. After liberation, everything changed completely. At the end of 1952, he contracted lung disease, and he thought: This is the end. But when the leadership discovered that he was ill, they immediately told him to stop working and introduced him to the Huaibei Saltworks Workers' Hospital for free treatment. After three months, he was transferred to the Yangzhou Jiangsu Provincial Workers' Hospital for recuperation for more than nine months. The comrades in the hospital took care of them very carefully, covering them with blankets in the middle of the night, and sometimes they walked lightly for fear of disturbing them. He said that when he was discharged from the hospital in good health, he had gained twenty-one pounds. The country's care for him encouraged his enthusiasm for production. He said: "The draft constitution clearly stipulates the rights that the working people should enjoy. To enjoy rights, we must better fulfill our obligations. I will definitely do everything in my power to complete this year's production tasks!"

    Things Unimaginable in the Old Society

    When the reporter interviewed Wu Duxi and talked to him about his thoughts on the draft constitution, he said: He has gradually enjoyed the various rights of the working people stipulated in the draft constitution since liberation. Wu Duxi is an old technical worker with twenty-five years of service and an advanced producer in the Guiyang Post and Telecommunications Bureau. He clearly remembers: During the Anti-Japanese War, once, lineman Jin Jiawei was injured when he was doing wiring work. The reactionary rulers not only ignored him, but also fired him. His colleagues sent him to the hospital, but the hospital refused to admit him. He was left at the hospital gate for several hours and finally died. He also clearly remembers what happened after liberation: In the city telephone team he was in, eight workers had been to the Chongqing Workers' Sanatorium and the Southwest Fourth Workers' Sanatorium, each for three or four months. For example, Comrade Luo Shuzhen, a telephone operator, suffered from lung disease and was hospitalized for recuperation for more than two years. She could still receive labor insurance relief money every month, and the trade union would send her things during the New Year and festivals. Comrade Sheng Binghua, a mechanic, also suffered from lung disease, and the bureau sent him to the Post and Telecommunications Sanatorium for recuperation until he recovered before returning to work in the bureau. Now he has gained weight. In addition, the bureau also has a nutrition canteen, and many old and weak employees have received nutrition. This was unimaginable in the old society. He said: "The draft constitution stipulates many rights for us, and it also stipulates glorious obligations for us. I guarantee to the Party and Chairman Mao and the people of the whole country: We must not only enjoy rights, but also strive to fulfill the obligations of citizens."

    进一步学习、宣传和讨论宪法草案
    国家逐步扩充劳动者休息和休养的物质条件
    照顾和培养
    沈阳电工机械厂总务科长穆庆祥，反复地学习了宪法草案。他越看越觉得这个宪法草案每条都符合人民的愿望。穆庆祥十几年前，被恶霸工头从山东骗卖到东北的煤矿当劳工。那时，他一天只赚到一斤烂地豆，还得先叫三四岁的孩子吃饱。他老婆每天出去要饭。日本鬼子被赶走后，国民党匪帮来了，他到沈阳一个电器工厂当木工。由于劳累过度，他得了重病，每天工作时干一会就得歇一会，因此就被赶出了工厂。他的病一天比一天重，不能起床了，每天就得靠老婆要饭来维持一家的生活。要一点饭，老婆不吃，只给孩子和病人吃，日子长了，老婆饿死了。当时他简直活不下去啦，眼里流着眼泪，想把五岁的孩子装到麻袋里扔到河里去，然后自己也喝卤水自杀。邻居王大娘发觉以后，救了父子俩的生命。
    沈阳解放了，他带着病到原来工厂报到，心里想，报到也是白费，有病绝对不能要。到了工厂，他把病情告诉了负责同志，工厂把他留下了。工作了二十几天，真是出乎他的意料之外，工厂又把他介绍到医院给治病。他的病好了，组织照顾他，分配做轻的工作。后来工厂又培养他，使他成为行政干部，担任总务科长。他说：我现在回想起来，没有共产党和毛主席的领导，我绝对没有今天。宪法草案中规定了劳动者有休息权，还有其他各种权利。我只有把我的工作做好，好好地完成党和人民给我的任务，用实际行动来拥护宪法草案。
    一个海港工人的自述
    在旅大海港医院医病的老装卸工宋希水，病刚刚好一点，就要坐起来写信感谢医院的医生和护士。每次当他看到医生在星期天来病房探望病人，护士在深夜给病人盖被，或者护士一口一口喂病人吃饭时，他心里就有说不出的激动。他在六月三十日写的一封信上说：我入院时病很重，人事不省，经过医生认真治疗，现已能走动了。
    新社会对劳动者的这种关心，使他自然地想起了过去的事。
    宋希水干装卸这一行有些年代了。日本侵略者统治时期，他有一次害了伤寒，就被日本鬼子赶进了当时的“华工医疗所”。这个医疗所好比阎王殿。老宋病得走不动了，就往痰盂里小便，被日本人发觉后，把他打得个半死。有些人的病并不严重，但因日本医生要学手艺，拿中国人当试验品，随便开刀，结果有好多人残废了。王春田的一只胳膊就是这样被割断的。许多人病还不重，但日本人硬说他快死了，把他们从病房拉出去。他们说：“我们还能活，请不要把我们扔了！”日本人听了，恨恨地骂：你们快死了，还说话！就这样活活地把一些人埋了。宋希水住的病房统共有四个人，除了他，那三个都叫日本人给折磨死了。
    最近，宋希水听人给他讲宪法草案后，知道劳动者在年老、疾病或者丧失劳动能力的时候，有获得物质帮助的权利。他感动地说，新社会真正做到了这一点。拿海港医院来说吧：医生对病院的病人不但体贴入微，问热问冷，就是在门诊部看病，也非常认真仔细，而且给病人想得很周到。为了怕病人挂号时等的时间长，他们采取了预约治疗的办法；还实行协定处方，医生开方后，病人只要两分钟就可拿到药了。除了这，医院还在码头上设了个门诊部，病人有病，随时可看，不必跑很远的路来医院。
    宋希水说，他病好以后一定要加倍努力工作。
    盐工杨全芝的体验
    杨全芝是淮北盐场灌西场的劳动模范，他学习了宪法草案后，把他亲身体验到的两种情况作了一个对比。
    他说，解放前，他在十九岁那年害伤寒症，家中连吃的都没有，更没有钱医病。他睡在床上七天，身体还没有好，可是，可恨的老板逼着他起来挑盐。解放后完全变了样。一九五二年年底，他得了肺病，心里想：这下完了。可是当上级发现他有病时，就马上叫他停止工作，把他介绍到淮北盐场工人医院去免费治疗。三个月后又把他转到扬州江苏省工人医院疗养了九个多月。医院的工作同志照顾他们特别周到，半夜三更给他们盖被子，有时怕惊动他们，都轻轻的走。他说，当他身体恢复健康出院时，体重增加了二十一斤。国家对他的关怀，鼓励了他的生产热情。他说：“宪法草案里把劳动人民应该享有的权利，都明确地规定下来了。要享有权利，就得更好地尽义务。我一定尽一切力量去完成今年的生产任务！”
    在旧社会里不可想像的事
    当记者访问伍都熹，和他谈起对宪法草案的感想时，他说：宪法草案里规定的劳动人民的各种权利，解放后他就慢慢享受到了。伍都熹是一个有着二十五年工龄的老技术工人，是贵阳邮电局的先进生产者。他清楚地记得：在抗日战争期间，有一次，线务员金家伟在进行接线工作时跌伤了，反动统治者不但不管，反把他解雇了。同事们把他送到医院，医院又不收，一直在医院门口搁了几个钟头，终于死了。解放以后的事，他也清楚地记得：他所在的市话股，就有八个工人进过重庆工人疗养院、西南第四工人疗养院，每人疗养了三、四个月。如话务员罗淑珍同志患肺病，住院疗养了两年多，每月还可领到劳保救济金，每逢过年节时工会还要送东西给她。机务员盛秉华同志也患有肺病，局里便把他送到邮电疗养所疗养，直到养好后才回局工作，现在他的身体已长胖了。另外，局里还设有营养食堂，许多年老体弱的职工都得到了营养。这在旧社会里是不可想像的事情。他说：“宪法草案给我们规定了很多权利，也给我们规定了光荣的义务。我向党和毛主席以及全国人民保证：我们不只要享受权利，我们还要努力尽到公民的义务。”
