Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 10th: According to TASS, the 28th issue of "New Times" published an article by "Modern Man" commenting on China's increasing influence in international affairs. The author wrote: The significant contributions made by the Chinese delegation at the Geneva Conference, Zhou Enlai's visits to India and Burma, and the joint statements issued, have further affirmed the international prestige of the People's Republic of China. The world public is clearly aware of how great a contribution great China can and will make to easing international tensions and strengthening universal peace.

The author wrote that it was no accident that the US ruling group was forced to agree to hold the Geneva Conference with the participation of the People's Republic of China on an equal footing with the other four major powers. "The New York Times" wrote that discussing the Korean issue and the Indochina issue without the participation of the Beijing representative was like staging "Hamlet" without the Prince of Denmark. The Chinese delegation at the Geneva Conference has strived to find fair and reasonable terms for both parties, which can enable the ceasefire and restoration of peace in Indochina to be realized quickly.

The article pointed out that the wall of economic blockade used by the United States to isolate China from the surrounding world is collapsing day by day. A Chinese trade delegation invited by British business people is now in London conducting negotiations on expanding trade between the two countries. Other Chinese delegations are also conducting negotiations on expanding trade relations between China and Indonesia, as well as with countries such as India. Commenting on the results of Zhou Enlai's talks in Delhi and Rangoon, the author pointed out that the principles announced by the Premier of the People's Republic of China, the Prime Minister of India, and the Prime Minister of Burma to guide relations between these countries are of paramount importance not only in consolidating peace in Asia, but also in consolidating peace in other parts of the world. The large number of reactions in newspapers and the opinions of political activists and social activists in Asian countries all emphasize that the talks between Zhou Enlai and Nehru, and the talks between Zhou Enlai and U Nu, illustrate to the world that the people of Asia are capable of solving problems related to their own destiny on their own.

The article pointed out that the US policy of discriminating against great China has failed. On this issue, the United States has not received the support of other Western countries such as Britain and France. Recently, the US reactionary camp has appeared particularly flustered. Senator McCarran even proposed a motion in the Senate: If the People's Republic of China's rights in the United Nations are restored, the United States should withdraw from the United Nations!

"Modern Man" finally wrote: China's position in international affairs is rising. The prestige and influence of the People's Republic of China is constantly growing, and for the sake of consolidating universal peace and developing international cooperation, it is extremely necessary to immediately restore the legitimate rights of this major Asian country in the United Nations, end the policy of discrimination, and establish normal relations between all countries and the People's Republic of China.

    苏联“新时代”杂志刊载文章指出
    歧视伟大中国的美国政策是破产了
    【新华社十二日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科十日讯：“新时代”第二十八期刊载了“现代人”的一篇文章，评论中国在国际事务中影响的提高。作者写道：中国代表团在日内瓦会议上作出的重大贡献，周恩来的访问印度和缅甸以及所发表的联合声明，这都更加肯定了中华人民共和国的国际威信。世界的公众很清楚地意识到，伟大的中国在缓和国际紧张局势和加强普遍的和平的工作中能够而且会作出多么大的贡献。
    作者写道，美国统治集团被迫同意举行有和其他四大国平等的中华人民共和国参加的日内瓦会议，这并不是偶然的。“纽约时报”写道，讨论朝鲜问题和印度支那问题时如没有北京代表参加，就如同上演“哈姆雷特”而缺丹麦王子一样。中国代表团在日内瓦会议上尽力找出对双方都是公平的和合理的条件，这些条件可以使印度支那的停战和恢复和平得以迅速实现。
    文章指出：美国用来把中国和周围的世界隔绝的那堵经济封锁的墙壁一天天塌下来了。应英国商界人士邀请的中国贸易访问团现在正在伦敦进行关于扩大两国之间贸易的谈判。中国的另外一些代表团也在进行关于扩大中国和印尼以及和印度等国之间的贸易关系的谈判。作者在评述周恩来在德里和仰光的会谈结果时指出，中华人民共和国总理、印度总理、缅甸总理所宣布的指导这些国家之间关系的一些原则不仅是在巩固亚洲和平方面，就是在巩固世界其他部分的和平方面都具有头等重要的意义。报纸上的大量反应以及亚洲国家的政治活动家和社会活动家的意见中都强调：周恩来和尼赫鲁的会谈以及周恩来和吴努的会谈向全世界说明，亚洲人民是有能力来自行解决关系到自己的命运的问题的。
    文章指出：歧视伟大中国的美国政策是破产了。在这个问题上，美国得不到其他西方国家如英国和法国的支持。最近美国反动阵营中显得特别慌乱起来，参议员麦卡伦甚至在参议院提出一项提案：如果中华人民共和国在联合国的权利恢复了，美国就应退出联合国！
      “现代人”最后写道：中国在国际事务中的地位正在提高。中华人民共和国的威信和影响正在不断增长，巩固为普遍的和平和发展国际合作的利益着想，极需要立即恢复亚洲这个大国在联合国中的合法权利，结束歧视政策，确立各国和中华人民共和国之间的正常关系。
