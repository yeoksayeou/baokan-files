Supply and Marketing Cooperatives in Various Parts of Shanxi Province Strengthen Rural Drug Supply Work

    Supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels in Shanxi Province are actively strengthening rural drug supply work. At present, 179 county cooperative federations and grassroots cooperatives in the province are engaged in pharmaceutical business. From January to May this year, the sales volume of the pharmaceutical wholesale station of the Provincial Cooperative Federation increased by more than one and a half times compared with the total sales volume of last year. In addition to managing some drugs and other goods produced locally, the wholesale station also purchases from Guangzhou, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Northeast China. At the same time, the station is gradually expanding its prepared medicine processing business. At present, it processes more than 40 kinds of traditional Chinese medicines such as pills and powders. Many supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions have specially trained a group of salespersons who can introduce the properties of medicines, and some supply and marketing cooperatives have also organized clinics according to needs and possibilities.

    山西各地供销合作
    社加强农村药品供应工作
    山西省各地供销合作社积极加强农村药品供应工作。目前，全省已有一百七十九个县合作社联合社和基层合作社经营医药业务。该省合作社联合社医药批发站今年一月到五月份销售的货物，比去年全年的销货额增加了一倍半以上。该批发站除经营当地出产的一部分药品等货物外，还到广州、天津、上海及东北等地采购。同时，该站逐步扩大了成药加工业务。目前，自己加工的丸、散等中药已有四十余种。不少地区的供销合作社已专门训练了一批能介绍药品性能的售货员，有的供销合作社还根据需要和可能，组织了诊疗所。（许慕贞）
