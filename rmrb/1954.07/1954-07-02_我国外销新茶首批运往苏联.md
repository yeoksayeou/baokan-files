    China's first batch of exported new tea, acquired and refined by the China Tea Company in East China, has been shipped to the Soviet Union. This batch of tea weighs 151 tons and includes six varieties: Qihong, Tunlv, Minhong, Hanglv, Wenlv, and Pinglv. It will be shipped to Soviet cities such as Moscow, Odessa, and Samarkand. This batch of new tea consists of superior and intermediate grades of fine tea, jointly evaluated by experts from both China and the Soviet Union.

    Currently, dozens of export tea factories under the China Tea Company's East China branch are working diligently to refine various new teas. The Hangzhou No. 4 Tea Factory, the largest modern tea factory in the country, will increase its output by more than double this year compared to last year. Another modern tea factory, the Tunxi Central Tea Factory, will increase its average daily output by a quarter compared to last year. This year, the factory installed thermometers on its wok-roasting machines, which will better control the heat and prevent the tea from developing burnt or smoky flavors, thereby improving the tea's qualification rate.

    我国外销新茶首批运往苏联
   【新华社讯】今年，中国茶业公司在华东区收购、精制的外销新茶，已首批运往苏联。这批茶叶计重一百五十一吨，包括祁红、屯绿、闽红、杭绿、温绿、平绿等六个品种，将运往莫斯科、敖德萨、撒马尔罕等苏联城市。这批新茶都是经过中苏两国专家双方评定的上级和中级的好茶。
    目前，中国茶业公司华东区公司所属数十个外销茶厂，正紧张地精制各种新茶。全国规模最大的现代化的杭州第四茶厂，今年的产量要比去年增加一倍以上。另一个现代化茶厂——屯溪中心茶厂，今年的平均日产量将比去年提高四分之一。这个茶厂今年在炒锅机上安装了温度计，已能更好地控制火温，避免茶叶发生焦味，烟味，提高了茶叶的合格率。
