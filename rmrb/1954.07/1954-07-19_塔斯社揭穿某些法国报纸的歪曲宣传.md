    TASS Exposes Distorted Propaganda by Certain French Newspapers
   [Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, July 17th] TASS Geneva, July 17th: The chief delegates of the countries participating in the discussions on the Indochina issue have held frequent informal meetings here in recent days. During these meetings, they broadly exchanged views on issues related to the Geneva Conference.
    It is believed here that the lengthy meeting between Molotov and Mendès-France on July 15th is of great significance. It is understood that this meeting discussed a number of important issues related to restoring peace in Indochina. It is said that the meeting took place in a friendly atmosphere and will undoubtedly have a positive impact on the work of the Geneva Conference.
    However, it is noteworthy that some French newspapers, such as "France-Soir," have distorted the nature of this meeting, attempting to portray the issue as if irreconcilable differences were exposed during the talks. This practice is clearly instigated by certain individuals, with the aim of influencing public opinion. In the above matter, some French newspapers are merely repeating the claims disseminated by American newspapers.

    塔斯社揭穿某些法国报纸的歪曲宣传
   【新华社十七日讯】塔斯社日内瓦十七日讯：参加印度支那问题讨论的各国代表团首席代表之间，最近几天来在这里频频举行非正式的会谈。在这些会谈中，他们就有关日内瓦会议的问题广泛地交换了意见。
    这里认为，莫洛托夫和孟戴斯—弗朗斯在七月十五日举行的长时间会谈有很重大的意义。据悉，在这次会谈中，曾讨论到一些有关恢复印度支那和平的重要问题。据说，这次会谈是在一种友好的气氛中进行的，并且毫无疑问地会对日内瓦会议的工作有积极的意义。
    但是，值得注意的是，有些法国报纸，例如
  “法兰西晚报”歪曲了这次会谈的性质，企图把问题说成是在会谈中暴露了不能和解的分歧。这种做法显然是某些人士所指使的，目的在于影响公众舆论。在上述这件事情上，有些法国报纸不过是重复了美国报纸所散布的说法而已。
