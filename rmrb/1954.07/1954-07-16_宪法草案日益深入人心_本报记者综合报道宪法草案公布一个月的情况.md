Since the publication of the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China on June 15th, it has been a month. During this month, extensive activities of studying, publicizing, and discussing the Draft Constitution have been widely carried out in urban and rural areas across the country. This activity is becoming increasingly in-depth and expanded, and the Draft Constitution has gradually penetrated the hearts of the people.

The publication of the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China has been warmly endorsed by people of all classes and ethnic groups across the country. Various democratic parties, people's organizations, famous model workers in industry and agriculture, combat heroes, people in cultural and educational circles, experts engaged in various scientific works, religious figures, overseas Chinese, and ordinary citizens have written articles in various newspapers and periodicals or delivered speeches on radio stations to express their support for the Draft Constitution. According to statistics from the People's Daily, Guangming Daily, Northeast Daily, Shanghai Jiefang Daily, Xi'an Masses Daily, and Chongqing Xinhua Daily, a total of 433 special articles celebrating the publication of the Draft Constitution have been published in the above newspapers since the Draft Constitution was announced. The people of the whole country regard the publication of the Draft Constitution as a great happy event. From Northeast China to Hainan, from Xinjiang to the coastal provinces, people everywhere cheered and celebrated on the day the Draft Constitution was published. Newspapers carrying the Draft Constitution became the most popular items among the people. Many newspapers increased their circulation on that day. The retail sales of newspapers in Shenyang increased from less than 10,000 copies per day to more than 49,000 copies. In order to study and discuss the Draft Constitution, people in various places have ordered separate editions of the Draft Constitution from Xinhua bookstores. Up to now, in addition to a large number of organs printing copies themselves to ensure that each cadre has one, Xinhua bookstores have distributed more than 11.84 million copies of the separate edition of the Draft Constitution across the country, including more than 171,000 copies printed in Mongolian, Uyghur, Kazakh, Tibetan, and Korean languages. Since June 19th, the Beijing branch of Xinhua Bookstore has sold more than 620,000 copies of the separate edition of the Draft Constitution.

The broad masses of people warmly support the various provisions of the Draft Constitution that guarantee the building of a socialist society in our country, the people's democratic system, and the rights of citizens guaranteed by material conditions. The provision in the Draft Constitution regarding the state's guarantee of priority development of the state-owned economy has been warmly welcomed by the broad masses of people, especially the workers and staff. Many staff members of state-owned economic sectors, such as Liu Xin, director of Shenyang No. 3 Machine Tool Factory, Feng Shengwu, manager of Qiqihar No. 2 Department Store, and Yang Zhonghai, industrial labor model of Jinan, used the fact that their factories or stores have been continuously expanding in recent years to illustrate the great role of the development of the state-owned economy in improving national production, improving people's lives, and transforming various non-socialist economies. The broad masses of peasants felt heartfelt joy about the provisions in the Draft Constitution regarding the state's encouragement, guidance, and assistance in the development of cooperative economy, and the use of developing production cooperation as the main road to transform individual agriculture. They use their own experiences to confirm that participating in mutual aid and cooperation is the only way to common prosperity. Zeng Lianyin, a member of the Red Star Collective Farm in the suburbs of Beijing, used vivid facts at a forum on the Draft Constitution held by the farm on June 15th to illustrate the major changes in his life due to his participation in cooperative organizations: Before Zeng Lianyin participated in mutual aid and cooperation organizations, his annual income was 3 million yuan; in 1952, he joined the agricultural production cooperative, and his annual income was 6 million yuan; after joining the collective farm in 1953, his total annual income was 9 million yuan, which was twice as much as when he worked alone. The members of the Xuzhangcheng Agricultural Production Cooperative in the suburbs of Fuzhou, Fujian Province, deeply realized the great significance of the provisions in the Draft Constitution regarding the state's assistance in the development of the cooperative economy from the fact that the state helped with water pumps and threshing machines to improve production, and expressed their heartfelt support for the articles in the Draft Constitution regarding the socialist transformation of agriculture. Many individual households and mutual aid groups have thus made up their minds to participate in or actively create conditions to strive to participate in local agricultural production cooperatives. Handicraft workers scattered in urban and rural areas have also warmly supported the provisions in the Draft Constitution regarding the socialist transformation of handicrafts because they have benefited from production cooperation in the past few years. The development of state capitalism in recent years, as well as the impact of various political movements on the bourgeoisie, have also made many capitalists express their warm support for the state's policy of protecting the ownership of capitalists' means of production in accordance with the law, and implementing the policy of utilizing, restricting, and transforming capitalist industry and commerce.

The people warmly support the people's democratic system stipulated in the Draft Constitution and recognize that the provision that "all power belongs to the people" clearly defines the people's status as masters of the country. When countless working people talked about the provisions in the Draft Constitution regarding the democratic system and the rights of the people, they all recalled the suffering they had endured in the old society and the situation of being masters of their own affairs after liberation. Jiang Yuying, a people's representative from Zhongshan District, Dalian, wrote an article in the Dalian People's Daily entitled "The People are the Masters of the Country." In his article, he summed up the enslaved and oppressed status of the people in old China in one sentence. He said: "At that time, the people only had the 'right' to suffer!" He talked about how he was arrested by officials in the yamen when he was twelve years old and forced to do hard labor for several months, while the young masters of the local landlord were not arrested at all. Because "they had money and power, and the knife handle was in their hands at that time." After liberation, he joined the work of the Dalian Native Products Company, and because of his active labor, he became an advanced worker. In the grassroots election campaign last year, he was elected as a people's representative of Zhongshan District. Before the first session of the People's Congress of Zhongshan District was held, he collected more than 2,000 proposals from the people (without summarizing them) and submitted them to the People's Congress. Most of these proposals were resolved or answered after the meeting. Liu Xiangge, director of the Fourth Workshop of Shenyang Machinery No. 2 Factory, who has been rated as an advanced worker and labor model of the factory five times, also has a deep understanding of the fact that the people are the masters of our country. He was also elected as a people's representative of Tiexi District by the people in the grassroots election campaign. He often reflects the demands and opinions of the people to the government, and the government tries its best to adopt them. Last year, he proposed to the government to install street lights south of Jianshe Avenue and build a cinema. In May of this year, street lights illuminated the streets there, and a cinema in a national style is under construction. Song Bing, the principal of Hejiatang Primary School in Hang County, Zhejiang Province, is a people's representative of Hang County. He participated in the county people's congress meeting with the opinions of the people, elected the county head and deputy county head of the county, and seriously discussed the various tasks of the locality. At that meeting, Shen Guixing, who had been a hired worker for eight years, was elected as the deputy county head, and he himself was elected as a government member. From his own experience, he also fully realized the superiority of the democratic system stipulated in the Draft Constitution. The countless facts mentioned by the people in their study and discussion of the Draft Constitution all show that the people have exercised the power to manage state affairs through the representatives they elected in the past few years.

The people warmly support the rights of citizens stipulated in the Draft Constitution and the measures to guarantee the people's enjoyment of these rights, and at the same time support the reasonable provisions on the obligations that citizens should fulfill to the state. The broad masses of working people have a deep understanding of the provisions on the right to work in the Draft Constitution. Chen Yuhua, a first-class labor model of Huainan Coal Mine, wrote in an article published in the newspaper: "In the old society, labor was regarded as a lowly thing; the exploiting class called coal miners 'black coalers.' My father died of illness because he could not get enough to eat or wear and worked in the harsh environment of the mine. After liberation, the situation changed greatly: labor became the most glorious thing in society. In the spring of 1949, I was still a coal shoveler, and soon became a rock drill operator, and this year I am driving a combined coal mining machine for production." Just as Chen Yuhua said, in our country, labor is a glorious thing. Many industrial and agricultural labor models and others who have made achievements in labor have mentioned how they have been respected, praised, and rewarded by the state and the people for their active labor when talking about their feelings about the Draft Constitution. The Draft Constitution stipulates that workers have the right to rest and the right to receive material assistance from the state in old age and illness, which makes the broad masses of working people deeply feel the state's deep concern for workers. Wu Duxi, an advanced producer of the Guiyang Post and Telecommunications Bureau, once talked to reporters of the newspaper after the publication of the Draft Constitution about the following facts: Eight workers in the urban telephone section where he works have been to Chongqing Workers' Sanatorium and Southwest Fourth Workers' Sanatorium for three or four months each. Telephone operator Luo Shuzhen suffered from lung disease and was hospitalized for more than two years, and she also received labor insurance relief every month. The post and telecommunications bureau has a nutritional cafeteria, and many elderly and weak employees enjoy special nutritional treatment. In old China, education was the privilege of the propertied class, but New China has opened the doors of schools to the children of the broad masses of working people. Many people who used to be shepherds, coal miners, or hired workers of landlords are now students in universities. At a forum on the Draft Constitution held by the Renmin University of China the day after the Draft Constitution was published, participants included Li Fenlian, a national industrial labor model who used to be the daughter of a hired peasant, Hang Peilan, a national textile industry labor model who worked in a factory since childhood and suffered oppression and exploitation, and Chun Jiacai, who participated in the Long March of 25,000 miles and suffered all kinds of hardships for the victory of the people's revolution. Sun Fangzhi, a model salesperson in the state-owned trade system in Northeast China and now a student at the Northeast University of Finance and Economics, published an article entitled "Poor Child - Salesperson - University Student" in the Northeast Daily on June 18th, writing about her joy of enjoying the right to education. Lu Kanru, vice president of Shandong University, and Xue Yu, director of the Department of Pharmacy of Beijing Medical College, also quoted many figures in their articles supporting the Draft Constitution to illustrate the continuous growth in the number of citizens receiving education since liberation due to the state's continuous expansion of educational institutions. The people are extremely excited about the provisions on various civil rights in the Draft Constitution; at the same time, they feel that the various obligations that citizens should fulfill as stipulated in the Draft Constitution are also their glorious responsibilities. The broad masses of workers and staff regard labor as a right, but also as an obligation, and therefore work harder to welcome the publication of the Draft Constitution with new production achievements. Wang Chonglun, a famous technical innovator, created the "multi-tool holder" 13 days after the Draft Constitution was published; the use of this tool can increase work efficiency by more than two times. The New Fifth Team of Wangfeng Mine of Jiaozuo Mining Bureau in Henan Province overfulfilled its production task in June due to the improvement of drilling methods. Many factories and mines also launched competitions for technical innovation and improved production during this period. The new morality of cherishing public property, which is stipulated in the Draft Constitution as a citizen's obligation, has made the people more consciously cherish and protect public property. Gu Chuncai, a staff member of the Shenyang Coal Construction Company, now gets up at four o'clock every morning to check the temperature of the coal storage yard more than two miles away to prevent the coal from burning. The broad commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army are even more determined to resolutely fulfill their sacred duty to defend the achievements of the people's revolution and national construction and to defend the security of the country and the integrity of its territorial sovereignty.

In the past month, in addition to the fact that cadres above the county level across the country have successively used the study of the Constitution as the main content of theoretical and policy study, the study and publicity activities for the Draft Constitution among the broad masses of people have also gradually unfolded. In order to help the people study the Draft Constitution, provinces and cities across the country have trained a large number of reporters and propagandists, forming a strong propaganda team. According to incomplete statistics, Beijing has trained more than 20,500 reporters and propagandists. Shanghai has trained a total of 2,522 formal reporters and temporary reporters, and trained more than 95,500 propagandists. A working team of nearly 100,000 people in Shanxi Province has gone deep into the masses to carry out the publicity activities of the Draft Constitution. According to statistics from Taiyuan City on June 30 alone, more than 60,000 people listened to the report on the Draft Constitution for the first time. Leshan County, Sichuan Province, plans to equip each three townships with two reporters, each agricultural production cooperative with five to seven propagandists, and each mutual aid group with two to three propagandists. Each county in Guizhou Province will have 300 propagandists. No matter in cities or rural areas, propaganda tools such as radio and blackboards are used. Many cities and rural areas also use various literary and artistic forms to carry out publicity to the masses. Before giving propaganda reports to workers, peasants, and citizens, reporters in Beijing adopted the method of trial lectures. In the trial lectures, some chose key units to explain directly to the masses; some combined the training of propagandists to conduct trial lectures; and some first conducted trial lectures among reporters, and then went to key units to explain directly to the masses. Reporters made more detailed preparations before the trial lectures. Xidan District divided the reporters into several groups according to different reporting objects and studied appropriate reporting outlines. Each time a reporter gave a trial lecture, other reporters were organized to listen, and a forum was held after the report, where everyone put forward their opinions and revised the reporting outline. This practice has played a good role in improving the quality of the report. When reporters and propagandists in Tianjin carried out publicity to the masses, they adopted a step-by-step approach. Since June 16, more than 2,000 reporters and more than 110,000 propagandists in the city have universally and comprehensively publicized the content of the Draft Constitution to the masses. The publicity of this stage has now come to an end. Through publicity, the masses have a more detailed understanding of the content of the Draft Constitution and why the Constitution was formulated. According to the questions and requirements raised by the masses in the publicity of this stage, the reporters and propagandists in Tianjin will further conduct in-depth publicity and explanation to the masses. Some areas have the shortcomings of not looking at the object and reciting the propaganda outline when starting publicity, which has been corrected in the work.

The Resolution of the Central People's Government Committee on the Publication of the "Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China" on June 14th stated: "Local people's governments at all levels across the country should immediately organize the discussion of the Draft Constitution among the people, widely explain the content of the Draft Constitution to the people, and mobilize the people to actively put forward their opinions on the revision of the Draft Constitution." After the publication of the Draft Constitution, after a period of study and publicity, the activity of mass discussion of the Draft Constitution has gradually unfolded nationwide. At the meetings of the People's Congresses held in various counties and cities across the country in the most recent period, the people's representatives have warmly discussed the Draft Constitution and passed resolutions supporting the Draft Constitution. A large number of agencies, organizations, and larger factories in the vast areas of the country, especially in many cities, have entered the stage of chapter-by-chapter and section-by-section discussion. 120,000 cadres in Shenyang have participated in the discussion; representatives of various democratic parties, ethnic minorities, and business circles have also conducted discussions in groups during the same period. More than 150,000 workers and staff in state-owned, local state-owned factories and basic construction departments in Tianjin have participated in the discussion of the Draft Constitution. In the discussions in various places, in addition to expressing their support for the Draft Constitution, the masses have also actively put forward opinions on revising or supplementing the Draft Constitution. The masses in Jinan and Qingdao in Shandong Province have put forward 160 opinions and questions in the discussions. In addition to expressing their opinions in the discussions, the broad masses of people also submitted written opinions to the local Draft Constitution Discussion Committee, local newspapers and periodicals, and even the Draft Constitution Drafting Committee. According to statistics, since June 15th, newspapers in Beijing, including People's Daily, Workers' Daily, Guangming Daily, China Youth Daily, and Beijing Daily, have received a total of 2,689 letters from the masses. Except for 244 letters from Guangming Daily that were not counted separately, among the 2,445 letters received by the other four newspapers, 2,200 expressed support for the Draft Constitution, 391 asked questions for answers, and 147 proposed revisions and supplements to the Draft Constitution. The masses actively put forward their opinions, fully demonstrating that the people are the masters of the country and the masters who personally participate in the formulation of the Constitution. The questions raised by the masses will be answered by the receiving units or submitted to the Draft Constitution Drafting Committee for reply. The revision opinions put forward by the masses will be promptly transferred to the Draft Constitution Drafting Committee for research and processing. In many areas, the method of studying while discussing was adopted in the discussions. The masses regarded the discussion process as a learning process at the same time, thus further understanding many problems and clarifying many concepts that were previously vaguely understood.

In the month since the Draft Constitution was published, the progress of studying, publicizing, and discussing the Draft Constitution in various parts of the country is developing along a healthy path. The main harvest of this period is that through the activities of studying, publicizing, and discussing the Draft Constitution, the political enthusiasm and production enthusiasm of the broad masses of people have been further improved, and the people's enthusiasm and confidence in building socialism have been further enhanced. Now, the discussion of the Draft Constitution is being extended from cadres to the masses. Due to the urgency of production tasks and the fact that the masses in some areas are busy with flood prevention and water management, before a large-scale organization of mass discussion is fully launched nationwide, all localities should earnestly study some methods that facilitate the masses, so that the activities of studying, publicizing, and discussing the Draft Constitution will not affect mass production, but can ensure that the people universally understand the main content of the Draft Constitution and its close relationship with themselves, and can put forward their opinions on the revision and supplementation of the Draft Constitution.

    宪法草案日益深入人心
    ——本报记者综合报道宪法草案公布一个月的情况
    中华人民共和国宪法草案自六月十五日公布以来已经一个月了。在这一个月中间，全国广大城市和乡村，都广泛地展开了学习、宣传和讨论宪法草案的活动，这种活动正在日益深入和扩大，宪法草案已逐渐深入人心。
    中华人民共和国宪法草案的公布，获得了全国各阶层、各民族人民的热烈拥护。各民主党派、各人民团体、著名的工农业劳动模范、战斗英雄、文化教育界人士、从事各种科学工作的专家、宗教界人士、华侨以及普通的公民，都纷纷在各种报纸、刊物上撰写文章，或在广播电台发表演说，表示自己对于宪法草案的拥护。根据人民日报、光明日报、东北日报、上海解放日报、西安群众日报和重庆新华日报的统计，宪法草案公布迄今，在上述各报发表庆贺宪法草案公布的专文的共有四百三十三人。全国人民都把宪法草案的公布当作是一件大喜事。从祖国的东北到海南，从新疆到沿海各省，在宪法草案公布之日，人民到处欢呼庆贺。刊载着宪法草案的报纸成为最受人民欢迎的物品。当天许多报社都增发了报纸。沈阳全市报纸零售额，由每日销售不到一万份，增加到四万九千余份。各地人民为了学习和讨论宪法草案，纷纷到新华书店订购宪法草案单行本。截至目前为止，宪法草案单行本除若干机关自己大量印行作到干部人手一册而外，新华书店已在全国发行一千一百八十四万余册，其中包括用蒙古、维吾尔、哈萨克、藏、朝鲜五种少数民族文字印行的十七万一千余册。新华书店北京分店从六月十九日到现在，已售出宪法草案单行本六十二万余册。
    广大人民群众热烈拥护宪法草案所规定的保证在我国建成社会主义社会，人民民主制度以及以物质条件为保证的公民权利等各项条文。宪法草案中关于国家保证优先发展国营经济的规定，受到广大人民特别是职工群众的热烈欢迎。许多国营经济部门的工作人员，如沈阳第三机床厂厂长刘新、齐齐哈尔市第二百货商店经理冯升武、济南市工业劳动模范杨仲海等，都用自己所在的工厂或商店几年来不断扩大的事实，说明国营经济的发展对于国家生产的提高、对于人民生活的改善以及对于各种非社会主义经济的改造，都起了巨大的作用。广大农民对于宪法草案中关于国家鼓励、指导和帮助合作社经济的发展，并以发展生产合作为改造个体农业的主要道路的规定，感到由衷的喜悦。他们用自己的经历来证实参加互助合作是走向共同富裕的唯一道路。北京市郊区红星集体农庄庄员曾连印在六月十五日农庄举行的宪法草案座谈会上，就用生动的事实说明了由于参加合作组织而使自己生活发生重大变化的情形：曾连印在没有参加互助合作组织以前，每年收入三百万元；一九五二年他参加了农业生产合作社，全年收入六百万元；而在一九五三年参加集体农庄之后，全年共收入九百万元，比单干时收入增加两倍。福建省福州市郊区许章成农业生产合作社的社员们，从国家帮助抽水机、打谷机而提高了生产的事实中，深切地体会到宪法草案中关于国家帮助合作社经济发展的规定的重大意义，并且对宪法草案中关于对农业实行社会主义改造的条文，表示了衷心的拥护。许多单干户、互助组并由此而决心参加或是积极创造条件争取参加当地的农业生产合作社。分散在城市和农村的手工业者，因为从几年来的生产合作中得到了利益，也同样热烈地拥护宪法草案关于对手工业实行社会主义改造的规定。几年来国家资本主义的发展，以及各种政治运动对于资产阶级的影响，使许多资本家对于国家依照法律保护资本家生产资料的所有权，以及对资本主义工商业实行利用、限制和改造的政策，也表示热诚的拥护。
    人民群众对宪法草案所规定的人民民主制度表示热烈的拥护，认识到“一切权力属于人民”的规定，明确确定了人民在国家中的主人翁地位。无数劳动人民在谈到宪法草案中关于民主制度、关于人民权力的规定时，都回想到过去在旧社会中所受的苦难和解放后当家做主的情形。旅大市中山区人民代表姜玉英在旅大人民日报写了一篇题为“人民是国家的主人”的文章。他在文章中一句话道尽了人民在旧中国所处的被奴役、被压迫的地位。他说：“那个时候，人民只有受罪的‘权利’！”他谈到自己十二岁的时候，曾被衙门里的官老爷抓去做了几个月的苦工，而本村地主的少爷们却一个也没有被抓去。因为“人家有钱有势力呀，那个时候刀把子握在人家手里”。解放后他参加了旅大市土产公司的工作，由于积极劳动，成了先进工作者，在去年的基层选举运动中，当选为中山区人民代表。在中山区第一次人民代表大会会议召开之前，他在人民群众中搜集了两千多条提案（没有经过归纳的），交给了人民代表大会。这些提案在会后大都得到解决或答复。沈阳机械二厂第四车间主任、曾被五次评为厂的先进工作者和劳动模范的刘向阁，对于人民是我们国家的主人有着同样深刻的体会。他也是在基层选举运动中被人民选为铁西区人民代表的。他经常向政府反映人民群众的要求和意见，政府也尽量加以采纳。去年他曾向政府提出在建设大路以南安装路灯和增建一所电影院。今年五月，路灯就照亮了那里的街道，一座民族形式的电影院也正在修建。浙江省杭县贺家塘小学校长宋冰是杭县人民代表，他曾带着人民的意见参加了县人民代表大会会议，选举了本县的县长、副县长，并认真地讨论了地方的各项工作。在那次会议上，当了八年雇工的沈贵兴当选为副县长，他自己被选为政府委员。他从自己的亲身经历中，也充分体会到宪法草案所规定的民主制度的优越性。广大人民在学习、讨论宪法草案中所谈到的无数事实，都说明几年来人民通过自己所选出的代表行使了管理国家事务的权力。
    人民群众热烈拥护宪法草案所规定的公民的权利以及保证人民享受这些权利的措施，同时拥护关于公民对国家应尽的义务的合理规定。广大劳动人民对于宪法草案中关于劳动权的规定，有着深切的体会。淮南煤矿一等劳动模范陈玉华在报纸上发表的文章里写道：“在旧社会里，劳动是被看成下贱的事情；剥削阶级把煤矿工人叫作‘煤黑子’。我父亲就是因为吃不饱穿不暖，在矿井下恶劣的环境中进行劳动得病死去的。解放以后情况大变了：劳动成了社会上最荣耀的事情。一九四九年春天我还是一个攉煤工人，不久便成了一个风镐手，今年又驾驶联合采煤机进行生产。”正如同陈玉华所说的，在我们国家，劳动是光荣的事情。许多工农业劳动模范以及其他在劳动中创造了成绩的人，在谈到对宪法草案的感想时，都曾联系谈到他们如何因为积极劳动而受到国家和人民的尊敬、表扬和奖励。宪法草案规定的劳动者有休息的权利，在年老、疾病有获得国家物质帮助的权利等，使广大劳动人民深深感到国家对于劳动者的深切关怀。贵阳市邮电局先进生产者伍都熹，在宪法草案公布之后，曾经和报社的记者谈到下列的一些事实：他所在的市内电话股，曾经有八个工人进过重庆工人疗养院、西南第四工人疗养院，每人疗养了三、四个月。话务员罗淑珍患肺病，住院疗养两年多，每月还领到劳保救济金。邮电局内设有营养食堂，许多年老体弱的职工都享受了特别营养的待遇。在旧中国，受教育是有产阶级的特权，新中国为广大劳动人民的子女打开了学校的大门。许多曾经是牧羊童、煤矿工人或地主的雇工的人，现在成了高等学校的学生。在宪法草案公布后的第二天，中国人民大学举行的一个宪法草案座谈会上，参加者就有曾经是雇农的女儿的全国工业劳动模范李凤莲，从小在工厂做工、受尽压迫和剥削的全国纺织工业劳动模范杭佩兰，参加过二万五千里长征、为人民革命的胜利吃尽千辛万苦的淳家彩等等。东北区国营贸易系统模范营业员、现在东北财经学院读书的孙芳芝，六月十八日在东北日报上以“穷孩子——营业员——大学生”为题发表一篇文章，写出自己享受受教育权利的喜悦心情。山东大学副校长陆侃如、北京医学院药学系主任薛愚，并在他们所写的拥护宪法草案的文章里引用许多数字，说明解放以来由于国家不断扩充教育机构，公民受教育的人数不断增长的情况。人民群众对于宪法草案中各项公民权利的规定，都感到极大的兴奋；同时对于宪法草案中规定的公民应尽的各项义务，也感到是自己的光荣的责任。广大职工群众把劳动看作是权利，同时也看作是义务，因而更加努力生产，以新的生产成就欢迎宪法草案的公布。著名的技术革新者王崇伦，就在宪法草案公布后十三天，创造成功“多活卡具”；使用这种工具，可以提高工作效率两倍多。河南焦作矿务局王封矿新五队由于改进了打眼方法等，六月份超额完成了生产任务。许多厂矿也在这一时期掀起了技术革新、提高生产的竞赛。爱护公共财产的新道德，在宪法草案被规定为公民的义务，人民就更加自觉地爱护和保卫公共财产。沈阳市煤建公司工作人员顾春财现在每天早晨四点多钟就起床，到二里多地以外的储煤场去检查温度，以免煤炭发燃。人民解放军的广大指挥员和战斗员更以无比的决心，保证为保卫人民革命和国家建设的成果、保卫国家的安全和领土主权的完整而坚决履行自己的神圣义务。
    一个月来，除全国县以上干部已先后以宪法学习作为理论政策学习的主要内容以外，在广大人民群众中进行的对于宪法草案的学习和宣传活动也逐步展开。为了帮助人民学习宪法草案，全国各省市都训练了大批的报告员和宣传员，组成了强大的宣传队伍。根据不完全的统计，北京市已训练报告员和宣传员二万零五百多名。上海市已训练正式报告员和临时报告员共二千五百二十二名，训练宣传员九万五千五百多名。山西全省近十万人组成的工作队已深入群众进行宪法草案的宣传活动。仅据太原市六月三十日一天的统计，第一次听取宪法草案报告的群众即达六万余名。四川省乐山县准备每三个乡配备两个报告员，每个农业生产合作社能有宣传员五名到七名，每个互助组能有宣传员二名到三名。贵州省每县将有三百名宣传员。无论城市和农村，广播、黑板报等等宣传工具都被利用起来。许多城市和农村还以各种文艺形式向群众进行宣传。北京市报告员在向工人、农民及市民作宣传报告之前，曾采取了试讲的办法。在试讲中，有的是选择重点单位直接对群众讲解；有的是结合训练宣传员进行试讲；也有的是先在报告员中进行试讲，然后再到重点单位直接向群众讲解。报告员在试讲之前都作了较为细致的准备工作。西单区曾根据不同的报告对象，把报告员编为若干小组，分别研究适宜的报告提纲。每一个报告员试讲时都组织其他报告员去听，报告后举行座谈，由大家提出意见，修改报告提纲。这种作法，对于提高报告的质量起了良好作用。天津市报告员、宣传员向群众进行宣传时采取了步步深入的办法。全市两千多名报告员、十一万多名宣传员自六月十六日起即普遍地向群众全面地宣传了宪法草案内容。这一阶段的宣传现在已告结束。通过宣传，群众对于宪法草案内容和为什么制定宪法等等，有了较详细的了解。根据这一阶段在宣传中群众所提出的问题和要求，天津市的报告员、宣传员将进一步向群众进行深入的宣传和讲解。有些地区在开始宣传时，由于缺乏经验，有不看对象、照念宣传提纲的缺点，已在工作中进行纠正。
    六月十四日中央人民政府委员会在关于公布
  “中华人民共和国宪法草案”的决议中曾写道：
  “全国地方各级人民政府应立即在人民群众中普遍地组织对于宪法草案的讨论，向人民群众广泛地进行对于宪法草案内容的说明，发动人民群众积极提出自己对于宪法草案的修改意见。”宪法草案公布以后，经过一个时期的学习和宣传，目前群众讨论宪法草案的活动已在全国范围内逐步展开。全国各县市最近一个时期召开的人民代表大会会议上，人民代表都曾热烈地讨论了宪法草案，并通过了拥护宪法草案的决议。全国广大地区特别是许多城市的机关、团体以及较大的工厂，已进入逐章逐节讨论的阶段。沈阳市已参加讨论的有十二万名干部；各民主党派、少数民族、工商界代表人物，在同一时期也按小组进行了讨论。天津市各国营、地方国营工厂和基本建设部门的职工，已经参加讨论宪法草案的有十五万多人。各地在讨论中，群众除了表示对宪法草案的拥护之外，还积极地提出了修改或补充宪法草案的意见。山东省济南、青岛两市群众在讨论中已提出意见和问题一百六十条。广大群众除了在讨论中发表自己的意见，也向当地宪法草案讨论委员会、当地报纸、刊物以至宪法起草委员会提出书面意见。根据统计，自六月十五日以来，北京市各个报社包括人民日报、工人日报、光明日报、中国青年报、北京日报，共收到群众来信二千六百八十九件，除光明日报二百四十四件未分别统计外，其余四个报社收到的二千四百四十五件中，表示拥护宪法草案的有二千二百件，提出问题要求解答的共三百九十一件，对宪法草案的修改补充意见共一百四十七件。群众积极提出自己的意见，充分表现了人民是国家主人翁，是亲自参加制定宪法的主人翁。群众所提出的问题，将由各收信单位或提请宪法起草委员会答复。对群众所提出的修改意见，则及时转交宪法起草委员会研究处理。许多地区在讨论中，采取了边学习边讨论的办法，群众把讨论过程同时也当作学习过程，因而进一步了解了许多问题，澄清了不少过去认识模糊的概念。
    宪法草案公布一个月来，全国各地学习、宣传、讨论宪法草案的进度正沿着健康的道路发展。这一时期的收获，主要是通过学习、宣传、讨论宪法草案的活动，广大人民群众的政治积极性和生产积极性更加提高，进一步增强了人民群众建设社会主义的热情和信心。现在，宪法草案的讨论正从干部中推及到群众中。由于生产任务的紧迫和某些地区群众正忙于防涝治水，因此在全国范围内大规模组织群众讨论全面展开之前，各地应该切实研究一些便利群众的方法，使对宪法草案的学习、宣传和讨论活动既不影响群众生产，而又能保证人民普遍了解宪法草案的主要内容和对于自己的切身关系，并能提出自己对于宪法草案的修改和补充意见。
