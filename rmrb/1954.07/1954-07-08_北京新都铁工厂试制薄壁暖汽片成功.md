    Beijing Xindu Iron Factory Successfully Trial-Produces Thin-Walled Radiator
    The locally state-owned Xindu Iron Factory in Beijing has successfully trial-produced thin-walled radiators and has begun formal production. Currently, the 32-inch four-column radiators produced by this factory have had their wall thickness reduced from four millimeters to two and a half millimeters. Each radiator uses three kilograms less pig iron, reducing costs by 27.4 percent. If this experience is promoted in all radiator factories in the North China region, it can save nearly 6,000 tons of pig iron annually. This pig iron can be used to make radiators for more than 60,000 additional houses. If all of it were refined into steel, it could manufacture nearly 80,000 double-wheeled, double-furrow plows.
    In the past, radiator wall thickness was generally four millimeters, and no one had ever considered whether this thickness was necessary or whether reducing the thickness would have the same effectiveness. Last July, the Xindu Iron Factory discovered during design that the wall thickness of previously made radiators varied, with the thinnest parts being only two or three millimeters. Such radiators could still withstand the pressure during use. Under the leadership of the factory's Communist Party organization, workers and technicians began to research and experiment with reducing the radiator wall thickness. Initially, some workers and technicians doubted whether such thinness would work, but testing proved that the thinner ones were just as pressure-resistant and usable. However, the difficult problem was that pig iron is not easy to cast into radiators as thin as two or three millimeters. The staff worked hard to study and solve a series of technical problems in core-making, sand mold making, and pouring. After eight months of effort, they finally succeeded in trial-producing radiators with a wall thickness of two and a half millimeters this March. Test results showed that the pressure resistance reached 17.5 kilograms per square centimeter. And the pressure resistance required for radiators installed in high-rise buildings is only 7 kilograms per square centimeter. Because the radiator wall is thin, the heat dissipation performance is also improved.
    Currently, the factory's workers and technicians are further studying how to reduce the radiator wall to two millimeters.
    The North China Administrative Committee's Local Industry Bureau recently convened a North China region radiator advanced experience exchange meeting to promote the factory's experience.

### 北京新都铁工厂试制薄壁暖汽片成功

    北京新都铁工厂试制薄壁暖汽片成功
    地方国营新都铁工厂试制薄壁暖汽片成功，并已正式生产。目前这个厂生产的三十二吋四柱暖汽片，壁厚已由四公厘减到二点五公厘，每片可以少用三公斤生铁，成本降低百分之二十七点四。这一经验如在华北全区暖汽片工厂推广，一年可节约近六千吨生铁。这些生铁可以多做出六万多间房屋用的暖汽片，如全部炼成钢，可以制造近八万部双轮双铧犁。
    过去，暖汽片壁厚一般都是四公厘，从来没有人考虑过是否必需这样厚，减薄是否有同样效能。去年七月，新都铁工厂在设计中发现过去所做的暖汽片壁有厚有薄，最薄处只两三公厘，这样的暖汽片也能耐得住使用时的压力。工人和技术人员在厂里中共党组织的领导下开始研究试验，把暖汽片壁减薄。开始有的工人和技术人员怀疑这么薄是不是能行，经试验证明薄的一样耐压可用。但困难问题是生铁不易铸成薄到两三公厘的暖汽片，职工们就努力钻研，在制芯、制砂型、浇注等方面解决了一系列的技术问题，经过八个月的努力，终于在今年三月试制成功壁厚两点五公厘的暖汽片。试验结果，耐压力达到每平方公分十七点五公斤。而高层建筑装置的暖汽片耐压也只要每平方公分七公斤就足够了。由于暖汽片壁薄，散热效能也提高了。
    目前这个厂的工人和技术人员正进一步研究把暖汽片壁再减到两公厘。
    华北行政委员会地方工业局最近召开了华北区暖汽片先进经验交流会，推广这个工厂的经验。
