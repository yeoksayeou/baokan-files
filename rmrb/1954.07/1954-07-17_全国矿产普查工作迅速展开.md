    National Mineral Exploration Work Rapidly Unfolding

    [By our reporter] The national mineral exploration work has rapidly unfolded. This year, mineral exploration areas cover twenty-one provinces and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, totaling more than 120 counties and hundreds of production areas. Participating in the work are graduates from geology colleges and geology departments of various universities, as well as professors, lecturers, teaching assistants, technical cadres, and administrative cadres, totaling several thousands of people, forming dozens of large teams and sub-teams. By the end of June, all exploration teams had arrived at their respective work sites and successively began their work. Some teams have already achieved preliminary results.

    The mineral exploration teams have received leadership and assistance from the Party committees at all levels and the people's governments at all levels. In addition to allocating leading cadres for the teams, dispatching skilled workers and doctors, and helping to solve living problems, various regions have actively collected mineral data and mobilized the masses to report mineral discoveries. Some areas have also sent film projection teams to show movies at the work sites. Wherever the exploration teams went, they were welcomed and supported by the masses. For example, during the peripheral work of an exploration team in a certain mining area in the Northwest, the local people voluntarily served as guides for the exploration team. As soon as the Southeast Zhejiang team arrived at its work site, the masses reported more than fifty mineral discoveries they had made within a few days.

    In order to strengthen guidance for the exploration work, the Central Geological Department has decided to send personnel and Soviet experts in July to inspect the work in the Northeast and Southwest. In addition, a working group will be organized to assist the work in the Northwest.

    全国矿产普查工作迅速展开
    【本报讯】全国矿产普查工作已迅速展开。今年矿产普查地区遍及全国二十一省和内蒙古自治区，共计一百二十余县，数百个产地。参加工作的有各地质学院、各大学地质系应届毕业生、院系教授、讲师、助教、技术干部和行政干部等多人，共组成数十个大队和分队。到六月底，各普查队都已先后到达工地，并陆续展开了工作。有些队已取得了初步成绩。
    矿产普查队得到了中共各级党委和各地各级人民政府的领导和帮助。各地除调配队的领导干部，派出了技术工人和医生，帮助解决生活问题外，还积极收集矿产资料，发动人民群众报矿，有的地区还派出电影巡回队到工地放映。普查队所到之处，都得到了人民群众的欢迎和支援。如普查队在西北某矿区外围工作中，当地群众自愿给普查队作向导；浙东南队刚到达工地，群众就纷纷报告自己发现的矿产地，不到几天群众报矿达五十余起。
    为加强对普查工作的指导，中央地质部决定在七月份内派出人员和苏联专家一起到东北和西南检查工作，另外还组织一个工作组到西北协助工作。
