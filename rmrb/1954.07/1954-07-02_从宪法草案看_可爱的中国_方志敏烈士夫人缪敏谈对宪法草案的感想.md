Xinhua News Agency Reporter Zhan Ping

On the morning of June 16th, I interviewed Miao Min, the widow of martyr Fang Zhimin. This female revolutionary, who has experienced more than twenty years of revolutionary life, spoke freely to the reporter about her thoughts on the draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China. She said that when she saw the draft Constitution, she was very happy and immediately read the entire text to her family. For several days, she read the draft Constitution word by word many times. The night before the reporter's visit, she excitedly read the draft Constitution and martyr Fang Zhimin's prison writings, "Lovely China," late into the night. She said that what excited her the most was that the socialist ideal pursued by martyr Fang Zhimin's bloodshed and sacrifice would be enshrined in the people's Constitution and become the legal goal of our country. She believes that the Constitution draft's provision that the state "guarantees the gradual elimination of the system of exploitation and the establishment of a socialist society" is a great joy for the people of the whole country. She excitedly said, "The blood of our countless revolutionary martyrs has not been shed in vain! Comrade Zhimin's blood has not been shed in vain!"

Miao Min analyzed in detail the articles in the "Preamble," "General Principles," "State Organs," and "Fundamental Rights and Obligations of Citizens" chapters of the draft Constitution. She greatly admired these provisions and expressed great satisfaction with all the articles. She especially mentioned the state's concern and protection for youth, women, and children as stipulated in the draft Constitution. She said: As a revolutionary and a mother, I was very moved after reading these articles.

Nanchang City is where martyr Fang Zhimin began his revolutionary activities under the instructions of the CPC Central Committee, and it is also where martyr Fang Zhimin heroically gave his life. The location of our conversation is only a few streets away from where martyr Fang Zhimin heroically died. During the conversation, Miao Min repeatedly mentioned martyr Fang Zhimin's arduous struggle and heroic sacrifice for the happiness of our people, and martyr Fang Zhimin's prison writings, "Lovely China." Miao Min said with infinite emotion: Our country is even more lovely than it was when Comrade Zhimin was alive. In the five years since the liberation of Jiangxi, Miao Min has been working in cities and villages in the province, personally experiencing our country's great social reforms and economic construction over the past few years. She told the reporter about the rapid progress of cities and villages and the daily improvement of the lives of the working people since our country's liberation, and also talked about the large-scale socialist construction that our country has already begun. She said very happily: "Our country is now just as Comrade Zhimin hoped in the book 'Lovely China': everywhere is filled with active creation, and everywhere is undergoing rapid progress." She added: When Comrade Zhimin was subjected to all kinds of persecution by the Kuomintang bandits in prison, he wrote in the book "Lovely China": "We believe that China will surely have a commendable and bright future. The Chinese nation built the Great Wall and dug thousands of miles of canals very early on, which proves the Chinese nation's great creativity! China... once it cuts off the chains of imperialism... and obtains freedom and liberation, this creativity will be infinitely brought into play. By then, China's face will be completely transformed by us." Miao Min said: The actual situation in our country in the few years since liberation has completely confirmed Comrade Zhimin's these conclusions; Comrade Zhimin's hopes and beliefs for our country's future are gradually becoming a glorious reality, how can I not be happy?

Miao Min also mentioned her two sons in her conversation. She told the reporter: Her eldest son will go to the Soviet Union to study this year, and her second son is studying at Moscow University. She said happily: They will all be engineers who build a socialist society in the future. She expressed that she will do her best, together with the people of the whole country, to build the motherland into an even more "bright garden" in accordance with the path stipulated in the first Constitution of our country, which is about to be promulgated, using the high patriotism expressed by Fang Zhimin in the book "Lovely China" and the lofty spirit of hard struggle expressed in the article "Poverty."

    从宪法草案看“可爱的中国”
    方志敏烈士夫人缪敏谈对宪法草案的感想
    新华社记者　战平
    六月十六日早晨，记者访问了方志敏烈士夫人缪敏。这位经历了二十多年革命生活的女战士对记者畅谈了她对中华人民共和国宪法草案的感想。她说：当她看到宪法草案以后，就非常高兴地马上把宪法草案的全文读给她的家里人听。几天以来，她把宪法草案逐字逐句地读了许多遍。就在记者去访问她的前一天晚上，她还把宪法草案和方志敏烈士的狱中遗著“可爱的中国”兴奋地读到深夜。她说：最使她感到兴奋的是方志敏烈士流血牺牲所追求的社会主义理想，将要在人民的宪法中固定下来，成了我们国家的法定的目标。她认为宪法草案上规定的国家“保证逐步消灭剥削制度，建立社会主义社会”，这是全国人民的一件大喜事。她兴奋地说：“我们无数革命先烈的鲜血没有白流！志敏同志的鲜血没有白流！”
    缪敏对记者详细地分析了宪法草案的“序言”、
  “总纲”、“国家机构”和“公民的基本权利和义务”等章的条文，她非常赞美这些规定，对所有条文都表示非常满意。她特别提到宪法草案中所规定的国家对青年、妇女、儿童的关怀和保护。她说：作为一个革命者和一个母亲，读了这些条文后，我非常感动。
    南昌市是方志敏烈士受中共中央的指示开始革命活动的地方，也是方志敏烈士英勇就义的地方。我们谈话的这个地点，距离方志敏烈士英勇就义的地方只隔几条街。缪敏在谈话中曾经一再地提到方志敏烈士为了我国人民的幸福而艰苦奋斗、英勇就义的情形和方志敏烈士的狱中遗著“可爱的中国”这本书。缪敏无限感慨地说：我们国家比志敏同志在世的时候是更加可爱了。在江西解放以后的五年间，缪敏一直在本省的城市和乡村中进行工作，亲自经历了我国几年来的伟大的社会改革和经济建设，她向记者谈到我国解放后几年来城市和乡村的飞速进步以及劳动人民生活的日益改善的情形，还谈到我们国家已经开始的大规模的社会主义建设事业。她非常愉快地说：“我们的国家现在正像志敏同志在‘可爱的中国’一书中所希望的：到处都是活跃跃的创造，到处都是日新月异的进步”。她又说：当志敏同志在狱中遭到国民党匪帮百般迫害的时候，他就在“可爱的中国”一书中写过：“我们相信，中国一定有个可赞美的光明前途。中国民族在很早以前，就造起了一座万里长城和开凿了几千里的运河，这就证明中国民族伟大无比的创造力！中国……一旦斩去了帝国主义的锁链，……得到了自由与解放，这种创造力，将会无限的发挥出来。到那时，中国的面貌将会被我们改造一新。”缪敏说：我们国家解放以后几年来的实际情况完全证实了志敏同志的这些论断；志敏同志对于我国前途的希望和信念正逐步成为光辉的现实，我怎能不高兴呢？
    缪敏在她的谈话中还提到她的两个儿子。她告诉记者：她的大儿子今年将到苏联去留学，第二个儿子正在莫斯科大学学习。她愉快地说：他们将来都是建设社会主义社会的工程师。她表示她自己要尽全部力量，和全国人民一道，用方志敏烈士在“可爱的中国”一书中所表现出来的高度的爱国主义和“清贫”一文中所表现出来的艰苦奋斗的崇高精神，遵照着我国将要公布的第一部宪法中所规定的道路，把祖国建设成为一个更加“明媚的花园”。
