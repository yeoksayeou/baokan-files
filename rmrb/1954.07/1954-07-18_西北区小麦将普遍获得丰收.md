(By this newspaper) The wheat crop in Northwest China is expected to achieve a widespread bumper harvest this year. Shaanxi Province has basically completed the harvesting and threshing of more than 23 million mu of wheat, with an average yield of more than 155 jin per mu, an increase of 3.16 percent compared to last year; the total output is expected to reach more than 3.6 billion jin, an increase of more than 200.2 million jin compared to 1953. In the Guanzhong area, many counties have an average yield of over 200-300 jin per mu. Agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams generally have yields of around 400-500 jin. The "July 1st" United Cooperative in Wangmang Village, Chang'an County, and some mutual aid teams have yields exceeding 450 jin, an increase of more than 20 percent compared to last year.

Most winter wheat areas in Gansu are undergoing intensive harvesting, and the Pingchuan and Yangshan areas have basically finished. Pingliang Prefecture estimates an average yield of more than 110 jin per mu, an increase of more than 10 jin compared to last year. In the better flatland areas of Tianshui County, the yield per mu is about 300 jin, an increase of 60-70 jin compared to last year.

Winter wheat and spring wheat are growing well in Xinjiang, Ningxia, and Qinghai. In Xinjiang Province, most of the 9.2 million mu of winter and spring wheat is ripening, and some areas have begun harvesting. The Manas Reclamation Area, a major wheat-producing region with 120,000 mu of winter wheat, will increase production by 10 to 20 percent compared to last year, with an average yield of over 440 jin per mu on 30,000 mu of high-yield fields. The "August 1st" Mechanized Farm in the Urumqi Reclamation Area can harvest more than 5.3 million jin from over 10,000 mu of winter wheat. The total output of winter and spring wheat in the province is estimated to increase by more than 80 million jin compared to last year. In Ningxia Province, the awns of more than 1.18 million mu of spring wheat have turned yellow, and harvesting will begin soon. It is estimated that the province's spring wheat production will exceed the original plan by 11 percent, an increase of 21 percent compared to last year. Currently, agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams in Ningxia Province are leading individual farmers in actively repairing agricultural tools, formulating summer harvest plans, and preparing to harvest wheat. At the same time, handicraft production cooperatives in various places are rushing to produce summer harvest agricultural tools, and supply and marketing cooperatives have also transported a batch of summer harvest agricultural tools from other places to meet the needs of farmers. The Pingluo County Supply and Marketing Cooperative plans to supply farmers with more than 22,000 pieces of equipment such as stone rollers, sickles, dustpans, and bamboo sieves, worth more than 370 million yuan. Wheat in Qinghai Province is also about to be harvested.
