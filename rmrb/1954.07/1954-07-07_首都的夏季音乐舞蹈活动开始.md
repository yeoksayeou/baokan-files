The summer music and dance activities in the capital have begun. The first music and dance soiree was held on the evening of July 3rd. From July to September, the capital will successively hold twelve mass music and dance soirees, held every weekend at the Beijing Concert Hall or the Labor Theater. Nearly fifty professional and amateur song and dance groups will participate in the performances, entertaining a total of 50,000 workers, students, cadres, and military personnel. This is the largest summer music and dance event in the capital in recent years.

　　At the first music and dance soiree held at the Beijing Concert Hall, the audience enjoyed many wonderful musical dances, including "Song of Anti-Japanese Soldiers Marching to Battle," "Sisters, Come On," "Song of the Sharpshooters," "Tell Me! The Wind from the Motherland" performed by the Cultural Troupe of the Political Department of the North China Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the Anhui Huangmei Opera "Beating Pig Grass" performed by the Central Experimental Opera House, the Tibetan song "Daofu Mountain Song," "Dege Mountain Song" sung by Bomu, a Tibetan actress from the Central Institute for Nationalities' National Art Troupe, and the Kazakh "Labor Dance" performed by Ming Jiamali, a Kazakh actress. Just as the performance was underway, it suddenly rained, and more than 3,000 audience members put on raincoats or held up umbrellas to continue enjoying the Chinese music "Little Shepherd Boy" and the overture to "Ruslan and Lyudmila" by the great Russian composer Glinka, played by the Central Song and Dance Troupe Orchestra. Finally, the dance team of the Central Song and Dance Troupe performed the beautiful Korean folk dance "Fan Dance."

　　This "Beijing Summer Music and Dance Soiree" is jointly sponsored by the Beijing Municipal People's Government Cultural Affairs Administration, the Propaganda Department of the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions, and the Beijing Student Federation, and has received enthusiastic support and sponsorship from professional and amateur song and dance groups and schools in the capital. The Central Song and Dance Troupe had already finalized its rehearsal plan for July and August, but when they received the invitation to participate in this performance, they decided to revise their original plan and find time to participate. Teachers and students from the Music Department of Beijing Normal University, some of whom were preparing to go home during the summer vacation, also worked hard to overcome difficulties to ensure their participation in the performance. On Sundays, the children's choir of the Beijing New Song Choir also volunteered to rest less and practice. Many military cultural troupes, who rarely met with the general public in the past, felt very excited to have the opportunity to perform for workers, students, and cadres in the capital. Some veteran musicians and artists, who no longer perform frequently, also enthusiastically participated in the capital's summer music and dance activities. From this summer music and dance soiree, workers, students, and cadres in the capital can also enjoy classical Chinese music, classical dance, folk art, and opera arias that were rarely seen in the past. This music and dance activity will strengthen the artistic practice of various art groups and further promote mass cultural activities. (Xinhua News Agency)

    首都的夏季音乐舞蹈活动开始
    首都的夏季音乐舞蹈活动开始了。首次音乐舞蹈晚会在七月三日晚举行。首都从七月到九月，将陆续举行十二次群众性的音乐舞蹈晚会，每周周末在北京市音乐堂或劳动剧场举行，将有近五十个专业和业余歌舞团体分别参加演出，总共要招待五万工人、学生、机关干部和部队工作者。这是首都历年来规模最大的一次夏季音乐舞蹈活动。
    在北京市音乐堂举行的首次音乐舞蹈晚会上，观众们欣赏了许多精彩的音乐舞蹈，有中国人民解放军华北军区政治部文工团演唱的“抗日将士出征歌”、“姐妹们来吧”、“神枪手之歌”、“告诉我！来自祖国的风”，中央实验歌剧院演出的安徽黄梅戏“打猪草”，中央民族学院民族文艺工作团的藏族演员博母演唱的藏族歌“道孚山歌”、“德格山歌”和哈萨克族演员明佳玛莉表演哈萨克族的“劳动舞”等。正当演出中忽然下雨，三千多名观众穿起雨衣或打着雨伞继续欣赏了中央歌舞团管弦乐队演奏的我国乐曲“小放牛”和俄国伟大作曲家格林卡的“卢斯兰与留德米拉”序曲。最后，由中央歌舞团舞蹈队演出朝鲜民间的优美舞蹈“扇舞”。
    这次“北京市夏季音乐舞蹈晚会”，是由北京市人民政府文化事业管理处、北京市总工会宣传部和北京市学生联合会联合主办，并且得到首都各专业和业余歌舞团体、学校的热烈支持和赞助。中央歌舞团原已确定好七、八月份的排演计划，当他们接到参加这次演出的邀请，就决定修改原计划，想法抽出时间参加这次演出。北京师范大学音乐系师生在暑假期间有人准备回家，也努力克服困难保证能参加演出。北京新歌合唱团少年儿童合唱队在星期天，大家也都自愿少休息进行练习。许多部队的文工团过去很少和一般观众见面，觉得这次有机会能为首都的工人、学生、干部演出，都十分兴奋。有些老音乐工作者和艺人已经不常演出，这次也热情地参加首都夏季音乐舞蹈活动。首都的工人、学生、干部从这次夏季音乐舞蹈晚会上，还可欣赏过去少见的我国古典音乐、古典舞、曲艺和戏曲清唱等。这次音乐舞蹈活动，将加强各艺术团体的艺术实践并进一步推动群众性的文艺活动。（新华社）
