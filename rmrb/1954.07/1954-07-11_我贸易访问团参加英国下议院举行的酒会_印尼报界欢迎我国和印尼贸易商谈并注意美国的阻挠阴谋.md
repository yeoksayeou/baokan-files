Xinhua News Agency, London, 10th—The Chinese trade delegation continued to hold separate meetings with British industrial and commercial organizations on July 8 to discuss some issues in import and export trade items.
The delegation attended a cocktail party held at the House of Commons. Those present at the reception included Mr. Attlee, Mrs. Bevan, former Chancellor of the Exchequer Dalton, former Chancellor of the Exchequer Gaitskell, former Deputy Foreign Secretary Younger, and some Labor MPs.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 9th—According to TASS, the trade delegation of the People's Republic of China, currently in Jakarta, has become the center of attention for the Indonesian press. The Indonesian press reported on the 9th that the negotiations between the trade delegation of the People's Republic of China and the Indonesian delegation are proceeding smoothly.
Indonesian rubber producers are very satisfied because fulfilling the trade agreement signed with China may break the price policy monopolized by the United States. Indonesia's "People's Daily" reported that in Jambi, central Sumatra, the monthly production of rubber has recently been 3,000 tons. After successful negotiations with the trade delegation of the People's Republic of China, the monthly production will increase to nearly 8,000 tons.
At the same time, the Indonesian press also noted the American conspiracy to obstruct Sino-Indonesian trade negotiations. "Eternal Daily" reported that a few days ago, U.S. Ambassador Coaming visited Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo and told him that the United States was particularly interested in Indonesia's decision to ship rubber to China.

    印尼的橡胶生产者感到很满意，因为履行跟中国签订的贸易协定将可能打破美国所垄断的价格政策。印尼“人民日报”报道，在苏门答腊中部的占碑，最近每月生产橡胶三千吨。在和中华人民共和国贸易代表团进行了成功的商谈之后，每月生产量将增加到近八千吨。
    同时，印尼报界也注意到美国阻挠中印（尼）贸易商谈的阴谋。“永恒报”报道，几天前，美国大使柯明曾访晤沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理，并且告诉他，美国对于印尼决定运往中国的橡胶特别感兴趣。
