A Great Event That Should Be Written into World History
Ye Shengtao

Atoms store energy, and when the energy within atoms is released, the power is enormous. This is a natural principle, what we call physics, and it does not change according to people's will.

Humankind has come to understand this natural principle and has found ways to break down a large number of atoms at once, releasing the energy within them and generating tremendous power. This phenomenon did not exist on Earth originally; it only appeared when humankind understood nature and could manipulate it. This is the result of human labor and wisdom, what we call science, and it is what makes humankind valuable.

Humankind has come to understand the principles of plant growth, and can therefore manipulate plant growth, cultivating superior varieties of grains and fruits that did not exist in nature. Humankind has come to understand the principles of animal growth, and can therefore manipulate animal growth, cultivating cows that produce exceptionally large quantities of milk and sheep that produce exceptionally large quantities of wool, which also did not exist in nature. Why do we do this? The reason is simple: to have food, drink, and clothing that are both good and plentiful, to live a better life.

The purpose of atomic energy research and utilization is the same. Humankind has created the phenomenon of a large number of atoms breaking down at once, which did not exist on Earth originally, just as it has created varieties of animals and plants that did not exist in nature. Humankind studies everything that surrounds it, and utilizes the results of that study, all with the goal of making life increasingly fulfilling. Even elementary school students understand this principle.

The July 2nd newspaper carried a news item stating that the Soviet Union's first atomic power station began generating electricity on June 27th, sending the first current to industry and agriculture in nearby areas. This is a great event that should be written into world history; this great event has opened a new era for science and industrial history. But on the other hand, it is only natural that the Soviet Union has such a great achievement. Since the Soviet Union has researched atomic energy, and the research has reached the point where it can be utilized, what else would they do with it but build a power station?

But in the world, there are those who do not follow the path that the Soviet Union has naturally taken. They researched atomic energy and manufactured atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs, with the goal of destroying humankind, destroying human culture, and destroying all life associated with humankind. They do so, of course, for their own reasons, but to say they are insane or mentally deranged would be to excuse them. In short, they are wholeheartedly the enemies of humankind, and we must recognize them as such, and resolutely oppose this group of enemies of humankind.

In fact, all scientific research should only be used for peaceful purposes, and not for any other purpose. If scientific research is used for destructive purposes, that is the greatest and most unforgivable crime in the scientific community, because it is fundamentally incompatible with human life.

Do not ask why the Soviet Union also has hydrogen bombs. You must understand that the Soviet Union has hydrogen bombs out of necessity. The Soviet Union must defend socialist countries and world peace, and since the enemies of humankind have atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs in their hands, and want to monopolize them, the Soviet Union must deprive the enemy of their monopoly. In my opinion, the Soviet Union is absolutely unwilling to develop atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs, and recent facts can prove this. According to a Xinhua News Agency dispatch from June 29th, the subcommittee of the United Nations Disarmament Commission held a meeting in London, where the Soviet Union proposed a suggestion that "all countries should undertake a sacred and unconditional obligation not to use atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction." It is clear that the Soviet Union is extremely willing to let go of these weapons. But this suggestion from the Soviet Union was rejected by the US representative and other Western country representatives.

If it were not for this necessity, I believe that the successful completion of the Soviet Union's first atomic power station would have been at least two years earlier.

The Soviet Union has made a historically significant start in using atomic energy for peaceful purposes. People all over the world who love peace should rise up even more united, support the resolutions of the World Peace Council and the Conference for Relaxation of International Tensions, and fight against the use of atomic weapons.

    应当写入世界史的伟大事件
    叶圣陶
    原子里储藏着能，原子里的能解放出来的时候，力量非常大。这是自然的道理，就是所谓物理，不以人们的意志为转移。
    人类懂得了自然的道理，设法把大量的原子一下子击破，让原子里的能解放出来，产生巨大的力量。地球上原来并没有这个现象，惟有在人类懂得自然又能操纵自然的时候，地球上才有这个现象。这是人类的劳动跟智慧的成果，就是所谓科学，人类之所以可贵在此。
    人类懂得了植物发育的道理，就能够操纵植物的发育，培养出自然界里原来没有的优良品种的谷类跟果子。人类懂得了动物发育的道理，就能够操纵动物的发育，培养出自然界里原来没有的产奶特别多的牛跟产毛特别多的羊。为什么要这样做？道理很简单，无非要吃的、喝的、穿的又好又富裕，无非要生活过得更好。
    原子能的研究跟利用，目的也相同。人类创造出地球上原来没有的大量原子一下子破裂的现象，正像创造出自然界里原来没有的动植物的品种一样。人类对环绕在周围的事物都要研究，研究出来的结果都要利用，无非要使生活越来越美满。这个道理连小学生也懂得。
    七月二日的报上刊载一则新闻，说苏联第一个原子电力站在六月二十七日开始发电，把第一股电流输送给附近地区的工业跟农业。这是应当写入世界史的伟大事件，这个伟大事件给科学史、工业史开了个新纪元。可是从另一方面想，苏联有这么个伟大成绩也是理所当然。苏联既然研究了原子能，研究既然到了能够利用的地步，不拿来建设电力站又拿来干什么？
    可是世界上偏有不像苏联那样走理所当然的道路的。他们研究了原子能，制造成什么原子弹、氢弹，目的在毁灭人类，毁灭人类的文化，连带毁灭跟人类关联的一切生命。他们那么做当然有他们的所以然，要是说他们丧心病狂，神经失常，那就是宽恕了他们。总之，他们死心塌地做人类的公敌，咱们呢，必须认清楚他们是人类的公敌，必须坚决反对这批人类的公敌。
    其实什么科学研究都只该用在和平目的方面，不该用在旁的方面。要是科学研究用在破坏目的方面，那是科学界的不可饶恕的最大罪恶，因为它跟人类生活根本不相容。
    不要问为什么苏联也有氢弹。要知道苏联有氢弹是个不得已。苏联要保卫社会主义国家，要保卫世界和平，而人类的公敌的手里拿着原子弹、氢弹，并且想垄断它，苏联就不能不剥夺敌人的垄断权。依我想，苏联是绝对不愿意搞什么原子弹、氢弹的，有最近的事实可以证明。新华社六月二十九日电讯，联合国裁军委员会小组委员会在伦敦举行会议，苏联提出一个建议，“各国应承担起神圣的、无条件的义务，不使用原子武器、氢武器和其他大规模毁灭性武器”。可见苏联是极端愿意放手的。可是苏联的这个建议遭到了美国代表跟其他西方国家代表的拒绝。
    要是没有这个不得已，依我想，苏联第一个原子电力站的胜利完成至少要提早两年。
    原子能用在和平目的方面已经由苏联作了具有历史意义的开端。全世界爱好和平的人民听到这个消息，更应该一致奋起，拥护世界和平理事会跟缓和国际局势会议的决议，为反对使用原子武器而斗争。
