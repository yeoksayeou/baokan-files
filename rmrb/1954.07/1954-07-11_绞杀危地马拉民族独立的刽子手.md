Executioners Who Strangled Guatemalan National Independence
Yan Nan

    For almost two weeks, the ugly drama of American aggression against Guatemala, directed by the United States, ended with the coming to power of a reactionary military government.
    U.S. Secretary of State Dulles, a major shareholder of the United Fruit Company, was naturally unable to conceal his joy at seeing the company's rule restored in Guatemala. Therefore, after the overthrow of the democratic government of Guatemala, he immediately "expressed welcome," considering it a "glorious victory." However, he still wanted to evade the responsibility that the United States should bear for this incident, and he pretended to say that "the situation in Guatemala is being healed by the Guatemalans themselves," attempting to show that the United States had not interfered in Guatemala.
    With the same feelings as Dulles, the chief writers and reporters of the American reactionary newspapers and news agencies were also enthusiastically discussing this incident. They openly advocated that U.S. Ambassador to Guatemala Peurifoy should be "warmly applauded" because this "expert" in suppressing national liberation movements in weak countries "played a huge role" in the overthrow of the Guatemalan democratic government ("New York Daily News"); Peurifoy's estimate of the life of the Guatemalan democratic government "was very accurate, almost down to the day" (Associated Press); and this "American ambassador, armed with a gun," overthrew the Guatemalan democratic government ("New York Herald Tribune"). At the same time, they also advocated that the overthrow of the Guatemalan democratic government should be "credited" to U.S. Secretary of State's brother, Allen Dulles, the head of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency; American reactionary journalist Pegler said that "organizing, instigating, and utilizing" "revolutions" like the one in Guatemala is the CIA's "obvious duty." -- What gleeful discussions! However, these discussions exposed Dulles's lies and proved that the situation in Guatemala was not being "healed" by the Guatemalans themselves, but by American conspirators like Peurifoy and Allen Dulles. These discussions fully exposed that the American ruling clique are precisely the executioners who strangled the Guatemalan national liberation movement!
    History also proves that using violence to overthrow a country's democratic government is an old trick of the United States to maintain its rule in Latin America. There are many examples similar to the situation in Guatemala. For example, in 1951, under the direction of American capitalists who monopolized the Bolivian tin industry, U.S. Ambassador to Bolivia Weegas orchestrated a "coup," overthrowing the government of Estenssoro, which was supported by the people, and helping a reactionary military man, Barrientos, organize a military dictatorship (this reactionary regime was later overthrown by the people); in the spring of 1948, U.S. Ambassador to Costa Rica Thompson orchestrated a "coup," overthrowing the Picado government, which the United States disliked, and in January of the following year, finally put Ulate, an agent of the United Fruit Company, on the stage as president. ... In the past fifty years, the United States has organized more than a hundred armed interventions and "coups" in Latin America! This American aggression against Guatemala once again illustrates that Wall Street continues to adopt this banditry to maintain its rule and increase its profits in Latin America.
    Dulles described the overthrow of the Guatemalan democratic government as a "glorious victory," but the people of Latin America see very clearly and understand how brazen Dulles's words are! The "New York Times" correspondent in Brazil reported: "Due to the war in Guatemala, the prestige of the United States in Latin America has suffered a serious blow," and "Latin Americans believe that the United States should bear direct responsibility." Even the Norwegian bourgeois newspaper "World's Road" said: "The bloodshed in Guatemala is not a glorious thing for the U.S. government," and the United States cannot absolve itself of responsibility for this bloodshed. It can be seen from this that the American interventionists are in the position of criminals in the court of justice of the people of the world, and what they have gained is not a "glorious victory," but another shameful failure politically and morally!

    绞杀危地马拉民族独立的刽子手
    燕南
    差不多两个星期，美国导演的一出侵略危地马拉的丑剧，以反动的军政府的上台执政而结束了。
    美国“联合果品公司”的重要股东、美国国务卿杜勒斯，眼看着这个公司的统治又要在危地马拉恢复了，当然是掩不住他心中的高兴的。因此，他在危地马拉民主政府被推翻以后，立刻“表示欢迎”，认为这是一个“光荣的胜利”。可是，他依然想逃避美国对这次事件所应担负的责任，他装模作样地说：“危地马拉的情势正在由危地马拉人自己去医治”，企图说明美国并没有干涉危地马拉。
    怀着和杜勒斯同样的心情，美国反动报纸、通讯社的主笔和记者们也在热烈地谈论这次事件。他们公开地主张应该向美国驻危地马拉大使普里弗伊“热烈喝采”，因为这个镇压弱小国家民族解放运动的“专家”，在推翻危地马拉民主政府事件中“起了巨大的作用”（“纽约每日新闻”）；普里弗伊对危地马拉民主政府的寿命“是估计得十分精确的，几乎连天数都不差”（合众社）；而且这位“美国大使手执枪杆”推翻了危地马拉民主政府的（“纽约先驱论坛报”）。同时，他们还主张应该把推翻危地马拉民主政府这件事“归功”美国国务卿的老弟、美国中央情报局特务头子艾伦·杜勒斯；美国反动记者佩格勒说：“组织、引起并利用”像危地马拉那样的“革命”是中央情报局的“明显的职责”。——这是多么得意忘形的谈论！然而，这种谈论却揭穿了杜勒斯的谎言，证明危地马拉的局势并不是由危地马拉人自己去“医治”的，而是由像普里弗伊和艾伦·杜勒斯这样的美国阴谋家去“医治”的。这种谈论充分地暴露了美国统治集团正是绞杀危地马拉民族解放运动的刽子手！
    历史也证明，用暴力推翻一个国家的民主政府是美国维持在拉丁美洲的统治的老把戏。和危地马拉情况相同的例子很多很多。例如：一九五一年，在垄断玻利维亚锡业的美国资本家的指使下，美国驻玻利维亚大使魏加斯策动了一次“政变”，推翻了为人民所支持的艾斯顿索罗政府，而帮助一个反动军人巴里万组织了军事独裁政府（这个反动政权后来又为人民所推翻）；一九四八年春天，美国驻哥斯达黎加大使汤姆逊策动一次“政变”，推翻了美国所不欢喜的皮卡多政府，而在第二年一月，终于把美国“联合果品公司”的代理人乌拉特捧上台当了总统。……五十年来，美国已经在拉丁美洲组织了一百次以上的武装干涉和“政变”了！这次美国对危地马拉的侵略，又一次说明了华尔街继续采用这种强盗手段，来维持它在拉丁美洲的统治和增加它的利润。
    杜勒斯把推翻危地马拉民主政府说成是“光荣的胜利”，然而拉丁美洲人民却看得非常清楚，了解杜勒斯的话是多么厚颜无耻！“纽约时报”驻巴西记者在报道中说：“由于危地马拉的战争，美国在拉丁美洲的威信遭到严重的打击”，“拉丁美洲人认为，美国应负直接的责任”。就连挪威的一家资产阶级报纸“世界之路”报也说：“危地马拉的流血事件，对美国政府说来不是一件太光荣的事”，美国不能解脱它在这次流血事件中的责任。从这里可以看出：美国干涉者在世界人民的正义法庭上是处于一个罪犯的地位，它所得到的并不是什么“光荣的胜利”，而是政治上和道义上的又一次可耻的失败！（附图片）
