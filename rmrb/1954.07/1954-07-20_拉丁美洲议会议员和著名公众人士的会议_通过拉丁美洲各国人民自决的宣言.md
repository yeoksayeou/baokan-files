Xinhua News Agency, Montevideo, 19th – According to Tass, a meeting of Latin American parliamentarians and prominent public figures was held in Santiago, the capital of Chile, from July 8th to 10th. The meeting passed the Declaration on Self-Determination of Latin American Peoples, a resolution in support of the people of Guatemala, a resolution on economic issues, and a resolution on the necessity of the struggle for democratic rights in Latin America.

A very important document passed by the meeting was the Declaration on Self-Determination, which was unanimously adopted. The declaration states: "Self-determination is an inalienable right of all peoples, which enables them to determine their own political institutions, social and economic systems without any external restrictions or interference. The aggression against Guatemala, jointly planned and led by American imperialism and the dictatorial regimes of various Central American countries, is a typical example of aggression by an imperialist country, the purpose of which is to overthrow the democratic system of other countries and establish a dictatorial regime by force, a dictatorial regime that is being rejected by the people of Guatemala and the people of Latin American countries."

The meeting emphasized that the aggression against Guatemala is an unprecedented example of infringing upon the right of self-determination of all peoples. The meeting pointed out in the declaration the terrible dangers encountered by the peace, sovereignty, economic and political independence of all countries south of the Rio Grande and every country.

The meeting defended the right of all peoples to freely determine their destiny and to control their wealth and raw materials - which are currently "completely controlled by foreign monopoly capital" - and condemned the decisions of the Tenth Pan-American Conference held in Caracas, which allow the United States to enjoy "the right to interfere" in the political and economic life of the peoples of Latin American countries.

The meeting expressed its determination to defend the principle of national sovereignty in the parliaments of Latin American countries through the joint action of parliamentarians and by relying on mobilizing and democratically organizing the masses, so that the rights of all peoples to establish their own genuinely constitutional regimes and legitimate organizations, and the right to maintain trade and diplomatic relations with other countries without any restrictions, will not be violated.

The declaration said that the existing Organization of American States must be replaced by a new organization based on other principles sufficient to guarantee the full equality of all members of the Latin American family of nations, capable of being recognized by the world family of nations, capable of defending democratic rights, and of defending the principle of coexistence of nations.

The declaration urges everyone to rise up and fight against all forms of colonial oppression, and to accelerate the process of independence for colonies and non-self-governing territories - mainly on the American continent.

The meeting also decided to retain the initiating committee of the Chilean parliament as a permanent body. This committee will establish links with various movements in Latin America and will prepare for the convening of a non-governmental conference to discuss Latin American issues.

    拉丁美洲议会议员和著名公众人士的会议
    通过拉丁美洲各国人民自决的宣言
   【新华社十九日讯】据塔斯社蒙得维的亚十八日讯：七月八日到十日在智利首都圣地亚哥举行的拉丁美洲议会议员和著名公众人士的会议，通过了拉丁美洲各国人民自决的宣言、声援危地马拉人民的决议、关于经济问题的决议和关于拉丁美洲为争取民主权利而斗争的必要性的决议。
    会议通过的一项非常重要的文件是它一致通过的自决宣言。宣言说：“自决是各族人民不可剥夺的权利，这种权利使他们能够在不受外界任何限制或干涉的情况下，决定他们本国的政治机构、社会和经济制度。美国帝国主义和中美各国独裁政权协同策划和领导的对危地马拉的侵略，是一个帝国主义国家侵略的典型例子，其目的在于推翻其他国家的民主制度，并用武力建立一个独裁制度，这独裁制度正受到危地马拉人民和拉丁美洲各国人民的唾弃。”
    会议强调说，对危地马拉的侵略是侵犯各国人民自决权利的前所未闻的例子。会议在宣言中指出了这个格兰得河以南的所有国家和每一个国家的和平、主权、经济和政治独立所遇到的可怕的危险。
    会议维护各国人民自由决定他们的命运和支配他们的财富和原料——这些东西目前“完全被外国垄断资本控制着”——的权利，谴责在加拉加斯举行的第十届泛美会议的决定，这些决定容许美国享有对拉丁美洲各国人民的政治和经济生活“进行干涉的权利”。
    会议表示决心通过议会议员的联合行动，并依靠动员和以民主方式组织群众，在拉丁美洲各国议会中保卫国家主权的原则，使各国人民建立他们自己的真正符合宪法的政权和合法组织的权利以及不受任何限制地和其他国家保持贸易和外交关系的权利，不受侵犯。
    宣言说，现有的美洲国家组织必须由一个新的组织来代替，这个新的组织要以足以保障拉丁美洲国家大家庭各成员充分平等的其他原则为基础，能够得到世界国家大家庭的承认，能够维护民主权利，并保卫各国共处的原则。
    宣言力促大家起来为反对各种形式的殖民压迫、为加速殖民地和非自治地区——主要是美洲大陆上的——取得独立的过程而斗争。
    会议还决定保留智利议会发起委员会为一个常设的机构。这个委员会将和拉丁美洲的各种运动建立联系，并将筹备召开一个非政府性的会议，来讨论拉丁美洲问题。
