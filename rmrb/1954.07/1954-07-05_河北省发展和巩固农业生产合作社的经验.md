Experiences of Hebei Province in Developing and Consolidating Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives
    Feng Xiaofeng
    Over the past winter and spring, after nearly half a year of effort, the number of agricultural producers' cooperatives in Hebei Province has increased from 3,645 to 31,496; the number of farm households participating in the cooperatives has increased from 0.74 percent of the total number of farm households in the province to 6.06 percent, totaling more than 470,000 households. At the same time, the number of farm households participating in mutual aid teams has also increased from 42 percent to over 50 percent. Whether in mountainous areas, plains, or coastal areas, farmers in many places that had never had agricultural producers' cooperatives before have begun to adopt this new mode of production. In the province's more than 11,000 townships, 76 percent now have agricultural producers' cooperatives. Among the farm households that have joined the cooperatives, about half are middle peasants. Under the leadership of Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, and poor peasants, an increasing number of middle peasants are being attracted to the mutual aid and cooperation movement.
    The establishment of more than 28,000 new cooperatives [Note 1] indicates that the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement in Hebei Province has begun to enter a new stage—moving from a stage where mutual aid teams have greatly developed, and after experimenting with agricultural producers' cooperatives, to a stage where agricultural producers' cooperatives are the main link. In the past three years, Hebei Province has experimented with more than 3,600 cooperatives. They have not only used their superiority in production to point out the direction of development to the broad masses of farmers, but have also enabled leading organs at all levels to accumulate experience in running cooperatives. Without the solid foundation of mutual aid in the past, and without the experimentation in the past, there would be no development this year. At the same time, this year's development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement has occupied a victorious forward position for the province to realize agricultural collectivization in the next few years. This year's development is not yet a major development, but rather an intermediate period between experimentation and major development, and also a direct preparation stage for major development. The experience of developing the mutual aid and cooperation movement this year is of great guiding significance for the movement in the future major development period.
    Prepare from two aspects
    One of the most important experiences in developing the mutual aid and cooperation movement this spring is to make relatively full preparations from both aspects: raising the ideological awareness of the masses and improving the leadership ability of cadres.
    The large-scale publicity of the Party's general line in the transition period, and the simultaneously launched unified purchase and sale of grain, educated the farmers to recognize and experience in actual struggle the advantages and disadvantages of the two roads—socialism and capitalism. This ideological struggle among the masses unfolded at a critical juncture: on the one hand, some farmers, under the leadership of the Party, experimented with agricultural producers' cooperatives, and the superiority of the socialist factors in the cooperatives attracted some farmers; on the other hand, due to the restoration and development of the rural economy, the spontaneous trend of capitalism increased, and some wealthy farmers became rich through commercial exploitation, grain hoarding and speculation, and usury exploitation, luring some farmers.
   "Where to go?" became the most realistic and sharp question in the countryside at that time. The in-depth publicity of the general line and the unified purchase and sale of grain so timely and powerfully struck at the spontaneous trend of capitalism, illuminated the direction for farmers to move forward, and made many people's minds clear. Some people began to understand that the small-peasant economy was a "bitter root" that should be gotten rid of, and that striving for common happiness with collective strength was the road that should be chosen. This struggle established the political advantage of socialism in the countryside, and directly prepared the most fundamental condition for the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement: that the masses voluntarily take the socialist road.
    In order to prepare leadership conditions for the mutual aid and cooperation movement, the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China held a provincial mutual aid and cooperation meeting in early December last year. At the meeting, everyone repeatedly reviewed Chairman Mao's instructions on the mutual aid and cooperation movement, studied the Party's general line in the transition period, recognized the significance of the mutual aid and cooperation movement for the socialist construction cause, recognized that it was the only correct way to carry out the socialist transformation of individual agriculture, and also an important aspect of ensuring the realization of socialist industrialization of the country; and recognized that the semi-socialist agricultural producers' cooperative was the central link of the mutual aid and cooperation movement in the current period. On the basis of unifying thinking and raising understanding and awareness, it was possible for everyone to correctly summarize and accept the rich experiences and lessons in the past mutual aid and cooperation movement. In the past, many areas in Hebei Province had mistakenly promoted "getting rich," or stimulated the enthusiasm of individual farmers to develop production with the "four major freedoms"; later, some local cadres realized that agricultural producers' cooperatives were the most vibrant things, and were very enthusiastic about running cooperatives, but forced farmers to organize cooperatives at times and places where conditions were not yet ripe; at the same time, some people did not understand how to transform individual agriculture into socialist agriculture, did not actively lead farmers to take the road of mutual aid and cooperation, and did not even have the courage to experiment with agricultural producers' cooperatives; when correcting the tendency of blind advancement in some areas, they indiscriminately shut down some agricultural producers' cooperatives that should not have been shut down, while failing to correct the spontaneous tendencies that existed simultaneously in other areas, thus harming the enthusiasm of some cadres, activists, and the masses in running agricultural producers' cooperatives, and encouraging the tendency of laissez-faire and the growth of the spontaneous trend of capitalism. Correctly recognizing these "left" or right tendencies and drawing lessons from them laid a preliminary ideological foundation for correctly implementing the central government's guiding principle of "active leadership and steady advancement" and for realizing the provincial committee's plan to develop agricultural producers' cooperatives in a planned and guided manner, distinguishing between different regions.
    After the provincial mutual aid and cooperation meeting was held, each county also held cadre meetings in the same spirit and method, using the Party's general line and Chairman Mao's instructions on the mutual aid and cooperation movement, as well as past experiences and lessons, to arm the minds of the cadres.
    These two aspects of preparation are very important. However, it cannot be considered that doing these things is enough. Later experience in the development of the movement proved that in the process of the movement's development, it is necessary to spare no effort to continue to strengthen these two conditions, that is, to continuously improve the level of awareness of the masses and continuously improve the leadership level of cadres, and strive to make the leadership level of cadres adapt to the needs of the movement's development.
    Train Cadres in the Movement
    At the beginning, each county made a plan for developing agricultural producers' cooperatives, which was completely necessary. The plan should be the result of the leadership's deep understanding and correct estimation of local conditions—the level of awareness of the masses, the strength of the cadres, and the foundation of mutual aid. With such a plan, cadres can have a clear idea. However, later facts proved that the original plans made by each county were far behind the demands of the masses. At the end of the unified purchase and sale of grain movement, farmers were brewing the establishment of agricultural producers' cooperatives, and many activists in the grain work became activists in the mutual aid and cooperation movement; representatives sent by the masses to the county party committee requesting help in establishing cooperatives were continuous. The party organizations at all levels obviously underestimated this situation; the influence of the superiority of the original agricultural producers' cooperatives—especially the influence that had been greatly expanded in the publicity of the general line—was also underestimated. Therefore, in the face of the masses' enthusiastic demand for running cooperatives, many places produced a feeling of helplessness. Some only saw the masses' enthusiasm for running cooperatives, lacked analysis of this enthusiasm, and regarded the masses' enthusiasm as the only condition for establishing cooperatives; others were worried that the masses' excessive enthusiasm would lead to rash advances, and thus passively imposed various restrictions. The provincial party committee criticized these two tendencies, pointing out that this situation showed that the leadership could not keep up with the requirements of the movement and lagged behind the enthusiasm of the masses; the correct guiding principle for solving this problem was to actively lead while advancing steadily. The provincial party committee required the leading cadres in various places to analyze the conditions in their own areas in a realistic and comprehensive manner, and to revise the original plans; do not blindly act only on enthusiasm, and do not rigidly adhere to the original plan. The actual solution to the contradiction between leadership and the requirements of the movement was gradually solved in the practice of the movement's development. The process of the movement's development is precisely the process of continuous improvement of the leadership ability of cadres.
    The experiences of leading the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement and solving the contradiction of leadership lagging behind the movement mainly include the following points:
    First, the primary link at the beginning of the movement is to train cadres and activists in the masses who run cooperatives on a large scale. Only in this way can the situation of the widespread development of agricultural producers' cooperatives be adapted to and can steady progress be guaranteed. Each county held one to three training courses. The province trained a total of more than 50,000 activists and more than 23,000 county and district cadres. All rural work cadres in each department of Wu'an County received training. The training work was presided over by the county party committee, and the "Resolution on the Development of Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives" of the Party Central Committee was used as the main teaching material. The Central Committee's resolution enabled cadres and activists to understand the specific methods for transforming the small-peasant economy after understanding the general line and general tasks. The resolution was mostly explained by the county party secretary himself. In the training, old cooperative cadres were also invited to introduce their experience in establishing cooperatives, which was of great help to cadres and activists. The training class armed cadres and backbones with the Party's policies and working methods.
    Second, the basic method of leading the work of establishing cooperatives is to focus on demonstration. Demonstration work is particularly necessary for areas where there are few old cooperatives and where the masses and cadres lack experience. This demonstration is different from the demonstration in the experimental stage of educating farmers with the superiority of agricultural producers' cooperatives. The purpose is to seek experience in how to build cooperatives step by step under the new circumstances, and to use key points to drive the general. The province demonstrated the establishment of more than 800 cooperatives, which played a good role in the orderly advancement of the entire movement.
    Third, the steps in the process of establishing cooperatives should be steady and the important links should be grasped. Experience from key demonstrations and subsequent general establishment of cooperatives shows that the specific steps for establishing cooperatives should generally be: relying on the leadership of the rural party branch, first carry out in-depth publicity of establishing cooperatives; led by backbones and party and non-party activists, carry out the brewing of establishing cooperatives and the establishment of a preparatory committee among the masses, and individually mobilize the masses to join the cooperatives; then, lead the members to study the draft articles of association and democratically formulate the articles of association of the cooperative, and carefully carry out the "four evaluations" [Note 2]; finally, elect cadres, formulate production plans, arrange labor organizations, and immediately launch production activities. Each step of this process is very important, among which the democratic formulation of the articles of association and the serious and reasonable "four evaluations" are important links in implementing policies in the steps of establishing cooperatives. From the process of leading members to study, discuss, and draft the articles of association, they can further understand the benefits and policies of running cooperatives, which is a process of specifically and deeply implementing the principle of voluntariness; that is, using the method of political democratic consultation, and economically stipulating the method of reasonable distribution system and the use of livestock and farm tools, to strengthen the solid alliance of poor and middle peasants in the process of establishing cooperatives.
    In the democratic formulation of the articles of association and the "four evaluations," some poor peasants often showed the idea of demanding too much and too quickly to increase socialist factors and egalitarianism, demanding that livestock and farm tools be returned to the cooperative without compensation, that the land yield be evaluated too low, or that the livestock and farm tools be evaluated too low and the return period be too long. These are all practices that are not conducive to uniting the middle peasants. Some said: "Socialism is coming soon, what's yours and mine, it will all be for everyone sooner or later." Some middle peasants also have a tendency to pursue individual development, demanding that the proportion of land dividends be stipulated too high, that the evaluation and interest of livestock and farm tools be set too high, and even demanding that the joining fee be stipulated too high to exclude poor peasants and harm the enthusiasm of labor, and also said that running cooperatives is "the poor taking advantage of the rich." When leading the solution to this contradiction, cadres should avoid one-sided middle peasant viewpoints and one-sided poor peasant viewpoints, and should educate them on the solid alliance of poor and middle peasants, adhere to the policy of consolidating the alliance of poor and middle peasants, and guide the solution to the above-mentioned problems with the spirit of rewarding labor and taking care of private interests, so that individual interests and collective interests are combined.
    The democratic formulation of the production plan is the end of the cooperative establishment stage and the beginning of the production and consolidation work. It is necessary to concentrate everyone's wisdom and strength from the formulation of the production plan, stipulate the management direction, seek ways and measures to increase production, study the methods of labor organization and use, budget and carefully calculate income and expenditure, so as to unify everyone's thinking and lay the foundation for increasing production confidence.
    Fourth, in order to overcome the difficulty of insufficient leadership, the method of "old cooperatives take apprentices and new cooperatives invite masters" can be adopted. In Dingxian, the cadres of 57 old cooperatives helped establish 129 new cooperatives nearby. Some places adopted the method of "skilled hands" with experience in running cooperatives from county and district cadres leading "new hands," learning while doing. Some places classified the districts and townships with and without an agricultural production cooperative foundation, sent experienced cadres to areas without a foundation, and sent inexperienced cadres to areas with a foundation, relying on the help of old cooperatives to carry out the work of establishing cooperatives. These methods are conducive to the progress of the work of establishing cooperatives and help train and cultivate cadres.
    Continuously improving the policy level and business ability of cadres in actual movement ensures that the vast majority of newly established cooperatives have the conditions to run well: each cooperative has backbones who are enthusiastic about running the cooperative, and about 100,000 party members, 50,000 league members, and 50,000 non-party grassroots cadres in the province participate in the cooperative. According to a survey in Tangshan, each cooperative has an average of 14 households, of which 7 are backbones (an average of about 4 party members, 2 youth league members, and 1 non-party cadre per cooperative). At the same time, the principle of voluntary membership is better implemented than in the past. 88.9% of the new cooperatives were established on the basis of mutual aid teams.
    The masses have enthusiasm, and the leadership has also figured out the experience, so the movement is progressing quickly. By the end of February, more than 20,000 agricultural producers' cooperatives had been established or were being established, and the enthusiasm of the masses and cadres was even higher, and the number of new cooperatives brewing to be established rose linearly. At this time, some local cadres were overwhelmed by the achievements they had already obtained, and produced a tendency to take quantity as victory and blindly pursue quantity, disregarding the conditions and advocating "burning another fire"; the leading cadres in some areas with a poor foundation of mutual aid and cooperation, seeing that they were lagging behind the advanced areas, also produced an impatient mood of seeking quick success. For example, in Luancheng County, more than 200 cooperatives were established in five days. The Rongcheng County Party Committee adopted the method of "cadre challenge" to promote the establishment of cooperatives, and also stipulated that "what the masses are willing to stipulate for the articles of association, they will stipulate," abandoning leadership. The phenomenon of acting hastily became more and more serious, and the argument of "establish it first and then talk about it" fueled this tendency. At that time, spring plowing was about to begin, and it was not appropriate to continue to develop; the newly established agricultural producers' cooperatives had problems to varying degrees, and it was also urgent to help solve and rectify them to facilitate production. The provincial party committee issued instructions in early March, suspending development and striving for consolidation. This instruction helped the comrades who blindly pursued quantity to calm down. The complacent mood and the thought of not going deep into understanding and not willing to face up to the problems existing in the new cooperatives were criticized. The movement entered the stage of consolidating agricultural producers' cooperatives from production.
    Prepare to move forward again in consolidation
    According to the survey and understanding of the work groups sent out by various places in March and April: about 40% of the new cooperatives not only have the conditions for running cooperatives, but also have well-written articles of association, reasonable "four evaluations," and are vigorously engaged in production; about 50% of the new cooperatives have good conditions, but the articles of association and "four evaluations" are not reasonable enough, and the production lacks planning, and if they are given practical guidance and assistance, they can be initially consolidated; about 10% of the new cooperatives have very poor conditions, and the "four evaluations" are also extremely unreasonable, production is stagnant, the organizational components are not pure, and some abandon agriculture to engage in sideline industries or commerce on a large scale, and the problems are more serious, most of which must be educated, guided, and reorganized into mutual aid teams. The common diseases of the above-mentioned types of new cooperatives are the lack of experience in operation and management, and individual members are still hesitant and uncertain, worrying about whether they can increase production and income. The central task of consolidation work is to solve these problems and remove obstacles to production. According to the experience of various places, the fundamental method is to start from guiding new cooperatives to plan production and launch production activities, and consolidate agricultural producers' cooperatives politically, economically, and organizationally.
    In order to carry out the consolidation work, each county held a mutual aid and cooperation representative meeting. Representatives of old and new cooperatives and some county, district, and township cadres participated in the meeting. The meeting universally adopted the method of "everyone raising questions and everyone discussing solutions" and "new cooperatives ask questions and old cooperatives answer them" to rely on the masses to solve problems. Some county meetings raised as many as thousands of specific questions related to increasing production and management, most of which were solved using this mass line method. The new cooperative directors said: "There are cars in front and ruts in the back, and our road will be easy to walk!" The Mancheng County meeting created the "three searches and three calculations" method, that is, searching for lessons, searching for experiences, searching for ways to increase production, calculating the increase in production account, calculating the expenditure account, and calculating the distribution account. "Three searches and three calculations" is a good way to inspire and rely on the enthusiasm of cooperative members to implement democratic management. It guides cooperative members to strive to increase income from digging their own potential, increasing production and saving, and doing a good job in management. In the "three searches and three calculations," each cooperative is also encouraged to introduce its own experience in solving problems (even if it is a small problem), so that the meeting truly achieves the purpose of concentrating experience and exchanging experience. Experiences were exchanged in the organization and use of labor, the distribution system, democratic management, and political and ideological work. At the representative meeting, the cadres of the new and old cooperatives improved their abilities, and the county and district cadres also learned a lot of experience. Many new cooperative directors said: "This meeting makes people stand up straight and have a way!" The Cang County Party Committee Secretary said: "This is the best lesson: relying on the wisdom of the masses, there is a way."
    In order to consolidate agricultural producers' cooperatives economically, on the one hand, the experience of "three searches and three calculations" was promoted, and each cooperative was mobilized to rely on its own strength to tap the potential of the cooperative in order to increase production; on the other hand, various methods were adopted to give each cooperative necessary support. When many counties held representative meetings, supply and marketing cooperatives combined to carry out product exhibitions and sign supply and marketing contracts with production cooperatives. According to statistics from only three counties in Cangxian Prefecture, 1,600 supply and marketing contracts were signed, with a total supply and marketing volume of more than 4 billion yuan. The bank is responsible for handling loans, and the effect is also very good. Appropriate amount of necessary loans, actively promoting supply and marketing contracts, especially the later pre-purchase work of cotton, wheat, oil, and fat pigs, directly supported the production of new cooperatives.
    After the representative meeting, each county immediately organized a work group to go deep into each cooperative to guide and help solve ideological, internal relationship, operation and management, and economic support issues. According to experience, the consolidation work of new cooperatives must first solve the problem of planned management production, which is the first difficulty encountered after transitioning from individual or mutual aid teams to cooperatives. For this problem, we must gradually solve it from two aspects: formulating or revising production plans and arranging labor organizations. Secondly, it is necessary to solve the problems of internal relations, such as "four evaluations" being too high or too low, the relationship between new and old members, opposing commercial exploitation, etc., to ensure that agricultural producers' cooperatives can develop normally and healthily. Facts have proved that the thinking of most members is often behind the requirements of the new production methods, which is the root cause of many internal relationship problems. Therefore, the solution to these problems is mainly to strengthen political and ideological education, improve the awareness of members, and at the same time, according to the spirit of the specific provisions in the Party Central Committee's "Resolution on the Development of Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives" and the local and current conditions, appropriately adjust the economic interests of poor and middle peasants, labor and private, old and new members, collective and individual.
    One problem encountered in the consolidation work is that new cooperatives generally lack accounting personnel; this has become a serious obstacle to the implementation of planned management. In order to solve this problem, the provincial people's government trained more than 300 accounting instructors to assist each county in training more than 23,000 new cooperative accountants. In order to strengthen the leadership of cooperative accounting work, each county has an accounting instructor who circulates to guide the accounting work plan, which is being implemented.
    Frequently strengthening the education of cooperative cadres is of extreme importance for doing a good job in production and cooperative consolidation. Hebei Province launched a movement to study the experience of Geng Changsuo as the director of the cooperative among the backbone of the new cooperatives in March and April. This movement was initiated by the party newspaper and led by the local party committee. Geng Changsuo's thinking and experience of "listening to the party, being selfless, relying on everyone to run the cooperative, and working hard to learn" have become the direction of conscious efforts for many new cooperative cadres; many people have made self-criticisms based on this and have set out vows for themselves. However, in the study movement, the party organizations in some places did not seriously carry out leadership, because they did not yet understand the important significance of carrying out political and ideological leadership by relying on the advanced thinking and advanced experience of living advanced figures.
    Overcoming the shortcomings of leading the work of running cooperatives in the past with the method of "handing the teapot" to adapt to the new situation after the widespread establishment of agricultural producers' cooperatives is an important issue. Some counties have successfully tried and are generally promoting the experience of organizing mutual aid and cooperation networks or joint committees with the township as a unit or with several or a dozen adjacent cooperatives as a unit. This is an organization for cooperatives and cooperatives, cooperatives and teams, and teams and teams to exchange experience in increasing production and management, and the cooperative directors and team leaders call it a "Zhuge Liang meeting." It is led by the party branch, based on old cooperatives as the backbone, and jointly participated by new cooperatives and mutual aid teams. The district cadres go deep into a cooperative as a key point, and at the same time guide the work of general cooperatives through this organization, and learn with everyone from it. This organization plays a role in mutual supervision, inspection, and joint research to solve problems. Most areas have now established this organization. Some places, such as Mancheng, Jinxian, and Dingxian, have also launched a production increase competition for planting according to the national plan among the cooperatives and teams in this organization, which not only directly helps the consolidation and improvement of the cooperatives and teams, but also powerfully influences and drives individual farmers to plant according to the national plan.
    The consolidation work before and after the start of spring plowing has been effective. The production of the vast majority of new cooperatives is booming, not only planting according to the national plan, but also planting quickly and completing the planting task earlier than ordinary farmers. Mancheng's 277 agricultural producers' cooperatives had 86 first-class cooperatives, 144 second-class cooperatives, and 47 third-class cooperatives at the end of the cooperative establishment. After more than a month of rectification, there were 198 first-class cooperatives, 73 second-class cooperatives, and only 6 third-class cooperatives.
    Consolidating existing cooperatives is not only for the present, but more importantly for the future. Consolidating existing cooperatives is to prepare more fully for the continued progress of the socialist transformation cause, and has a direct relationship with whether the cooperativization movement can develop healthily in a big way after the autumn of this year. However, some cadres still do not fully understand the important significance of consolidating cooperatives. Some said: "It's good to build it up, and it's okay if it doesn't collapse." Some, although they also attach importance to the consolidation work, are only afraid of being criticized and punished for running the existing cooperatives badly; therefore, after carrying out a period of consolidation work and achieving some results, they see that the cooperatives will not collapse, and they relax, become complacent, and stop halfway, not understanding that the work that has been carried out is just the beginning, and the work of consolidating and improving agricultural producers' cooperatives must be carried out throughout the year; nor do they understand that to further develop the cooperativization movement, the existing foundation is still not strong enough and must be greatly strengthened.
    Party Leadership is a Guarantee of Victory
    The process of this year's mutual aid and cooperation movement is actually also the process of the leading focus of the party organizations at all levels in rural areas shifting to the development of mutual aid and cooperation to improve agricultural productivity. Wherever the spirit of "the party committee is responsible, the secretary takes action, and the whole party runs the cooperative" is seriously implemented, the movement has achieved better results. The party's active and correct leadership is a decisive condition for the steady progress of the movement.
    The situation and experience of the movement's development prove that it is necessary to correctly carry out the struggle on two fronts from beginning to end. The conservative thought that is manifested in the initial steady state and the residual thoughts of laissez-faire tendencies, and the rash advance that is manifested in being overwhelmed by the victory, disregarding subjective and objective conditions, taking quantity as victory, and thus inevitably deviating from the masses, must be pointed out and corrected in a timely manner. It is necessary to strictly grasp the spirit of acting according to conditions and cherishing the enthusiasm of the masses, to meet the needs of the masses to establish cooperatives and not to act rashly, so as to do more and do better. The root causes of the above two tendencies are both subjectivism; it is a manifestation of not acting according to local conditions and not actively creating conditions, and not recognizing objective laws and not actively learning to grasp laws.
    The emergence of these two tendencies also reflects that the level of leadership over the cooperativization cause lags behind the requirements of the movement's development. At present, the weakest link in leadership is the county and district; the county and district cadres, who are in the position of actual organizers and leaders of the movement, are mostly unfamiliar with the theory, policies, and business of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, and lack experience in running cooperatives. According to a survey by the Tianjin Prefectural Committee, among more than 3,000 county-level cadres, only 5.62% are familiar with the work of running cooperatives, 13% have a smattering of knowledge, and 81.38% are laymen. The situation of district cadres is roughly the same. After the movement entered the consolidation stage, at a mutual aid and cooperation meeting held by the Handan Prefectural Committee, some county party committee secretaries did not say a word in two days. After testing, two-fifths of the 25 county party committees failed. To solve this contradiction, we should not adopt negative methods, or use the method of slowing down the necessary development speed and suppressing the enthusiasm of the masses to solve it, but must take positive methods to improve the level of leadership, so that the leadership catches up with the requirements of the objective movement. After the past period of work, the leadership situation in counties and districts has improved, but the problem has not been completely solved and must be doubled in efforts to continue to improve the ability of cadres to run the cooperativization cause. At the same time, we should also pay attention to improving the leadership level of grassroots party organizations and improving the quality of the work of mutual aid and cooperation committees and mutual aid and cooperation networks, so as to train cadres and improve leadership in practice.
    [Note 1] The number of new cooperatives and the number of old cooperatives do not add up to the total number, because some old cooperatives were merged in the movement.
    [Note 2] "Four evaluations" is a popular shorthand term for members evaluating the high and low output of land, the amount of livestock and farm tools depreciated, and the work points (dead scores) of labor when joining the cooperative. According to the situation of establishing cooperatives in Hebei this spring, in fact, only "three evaluations" were carried out in the process of establishing cooperatives, and the evaluation of labor work points was carried out after the cooperative was established.

    河北省发展和巩固农业生产合作社的经验
    冯小风
    经过去冬今春近半年的努力，河北省的农业生产合作社，由三千六百四十五个发展到三万一千四百九十六个；参加社的农户，由原来占全省总农户的百分之○点七四，达到了百分之六点○六，共计四十七万多户。同时，参加互助组的农户，也由百分之四十二增加到百分之五十以上。不论山地、平原、滨海，许多从来没有过农业生产合作社的地方，农民开始采取了这种新的生产方式。全省一万一千多个乡，已有百分之七十六有了农业生产合作社。在入社的农户中，约有半数左右是中农。在共产党员、青年团员和贫农的带动下，中农群众越来越多地被吸引到互助合作运动中来了。
    两万八千多个新社〔注一〕的建立，说明了河北省互助合作运动的发展开始进入一个新阶段——在互助组有了很大发展的基础上，经过试办农业生产合作社之后，开始转入以农业生产合作社为主要环节。过去三年内，河北省试办了三千六百多个社。它们不仅用在生产上的优越性向广大农民指出了发展方向，而且使各级领导机关都有一部分干部积累了办社的经验。没有过去的雄厚的互助基础，没有过去的试办，就不会有今年的发展。同时，今年互助合作运动的发展，又为全省在今后数年内实现农业合作化占领了胜利前进的阵地。今年的发展还不是大发展，而是试办与大发展之间的中间时期，也是大发展的直接准备阶段。今年发展互助合作运动的经验，对今后大发展时期的运动，是有很重要的指导意义的。
    从两方面做好准备工作
    今年春季发展互助合作运动的最重要的经验之一，就是从提高群众思想觉悟和提高干部领导能力两方面作了比较充分的准备工作。
    大张旗鼓地宣传党在过渡时期的总路线，和同时展开的粮食统购统销工作，教育农民认清了并且在实际斗争中体验到两条道路——社会主义和资本主义道路的利、害。群众思想上的这一场斗争，是在一个严重的关头展开的：一方面，有一些农民在党的领导下试办了农业生产合作社，社内的社会主义因素表现出来的优越性吸引着一部分农民；另一方面，由于农村经济的恢复和发展，资本主义自发趋势增长了，部分富裕农民借商业剥削、粮食囤积投机和高利贷剥削而发财，引诱着一部分农民。
  “向那里走？”成为当时农村里最现实和最尖锐的问题。总路线的深入宣传，粮食的统购统销，是那么适时而有力地打击了资本主义的自发趋势，照亮了农民前进的方向，使很多人的头脑清醒了。一部分人开始懂得了小农经济是应该摆脱的“苦根”，用集体的力量争取共同的幸福是应该选取的道路。这场斗争树立了社会主义在农村的政治优势，直接为互助合作运动的发展准备了群众自愿走社会主义道路这个最根本的条件。
    为了给互助合作运动准备领导方面的条件，中共河北省委在去年十二月上旬，召开了全省互助合作会议。在会议上，大家再三温习毛主席关于互助合作运动的指示，学习党在过渡时期的总路线，认清了互助合作运动对于社会主义建设事业的意义，认识了它是对个体农业实行社会主义改造的惟一正确的途径，也是保证国家实现社会主义工业化的一个重要方面；并且认识了半社会主义性质的农业生产合作社是当前时期互助合作运动的中心环节。在统一了思想，提高了认识和觉悟的基础上，大家就有可能正确地总结和接受过去互助合作运动中的丰富的经验和教训。过去在河北省的许多地区曾错误地宣传“发家致富”，或以“四大自由”来刺激个体农民发展生产的积极性；后来也曾有一些地方的干部，认识了农业生产合作社是最有生命力的东西，办社的热情很高，但却在条件尚未具备的时间和地点，强迫农民组织合作社；同时也有一些人，不了解怎样把个体农业变为社会主义的农业，不积极领导农民走互助合作的道路，连试办农业生产合作社的勇气也没有；在纠正部分地区的盲目冒进的倾向时，不加区别地停办了一些不应该停办的农业生产合作社，而对于在另外一些地区同时存在的自流倾向却没有去纠正，因而伤害了一些干部、积极分子和群众办农业生产合作社的热情，助长了放任自流的倾向和资本主义自发趋势的滋长。正确地认识了这些“左”或右的倾向，从中取得教训，就为正确执行中央指示的“积极领导，稳步前进”的方针，为实现省委规定的区别不同地区、有计划和有领导地发展农业生产合作社的计划，初步地打下了思想基础。
    在举行了省互助合作会议以后，各县也按照同样精神和方法，召开了干部会议，以党的总路线和毛主席关于互助合作运动的指示以及过去的经验教训，武装了干部的头脑。
    这两方面的准备工作是很重要的。但是，不能认为做了这一些已经够了。后来运动发展的经验证明，在运动发展过程中，必须不遗余力地继续强化这两方面的条件，即不断地提高群众的觉悟水平和不断提高干部的领导水平，力求干部的领导水平适应运动发展的需要。
    在运动中锻炼干部
    开始，各县都作了发展农业生产合作社的计划，这是完全必要的。计划，应该是领导方面对于当地条件——群众的觉悟水平，干部力量和互助基础的深刻了解、正确估计的结果。有了这样的计划，就能够使干部心中有数。但是，后来的事实证明，各县最初做的计划，都是远远落后于群众要求的。粮食统购统销运动的末期，农民纷纷酝酿建立农业生产合作社，粮食工作中的很多积极分子变成了互助合作运动的积极分子；群众派到县委那里要求帮助建社的代表络绎不断。各级党组织对于这个情况，显然估计得不足了；对于原有的农业生产合作社的优越性的影响——特别是在总路线宣传中已经大大扩大了的影响，也估计不足。因此，在群众热情要求办社的情况面前，有不少地方产生了手足无措的现象。有的只看到群众热情办社，对这种热情缺乏分析，把群众热情作为建社的唯一条件；有的则耽心由于群众过于热情会产生冒进偏向，因而消极地多方加以限制。省委批判了这两种倾向，指出这种情况表现出了领导赶不上运动的要求、落后于群众的热情的问题；解决这个问题的正确方针，就是必须积极领导而又要稳步前进。省委要求各地领导干部实事求是地全面地分析自己地区的条件，修订原来的计划；不要盲目地只凭热情办事，也不要死守住原计划不放。而实际地解决领导赶不上运动要求的矛盾，却是在运动发展的实践过程中逐步解决的。运动发展的过程，正是干部的领导能力不断提高的过程。
    领导发展互助合作运动和解决领导落后于运动的矛盾的经验，主要有以下几点：
    一、运动开始的首要一环，是大规模地训练干部、训练群众中办社的积极分子。这样才能适应农业生产合作社普遍发展的形势而又能保证稳步前进。每县都召开了一期到三期训练班。全省共训练积极分子五万多人，训练县区干部两万三千多人。武安县区各部门所有农村工作干部都受到了训练。训练工作由县委主持，以党中央“关于发展农业生产合作社的决议”作为主要教材。中央的决议，使干部和积极分子在懂得了总路线总任务之后，又懂得了改造小农经济的具体方法。决议大都是由县委书记亲自讲解的。训练中，还请老社干部介绍建社经验，对干部和积极分子的帮助也很大。训练班以党的政策和工作方法武装了干部和办社的骨干。
    二、领导建社工作的基本方法是重点示范。示范工作，对于过去老社很少、群众和干部都缺少经验的地区，是特别必要的。这种示范不同于试办阶段以农业生产合作社的优越性教育农民的示范，目的是寻求在新的情况下怎样有步骤地把社建好的经验，并以重点带动一般。全省示范建社八百多个，对于整个运动有条不紊地前进，起了良好的作用。
    三、在建社过程中步骤要稳当并要抓住重要环节。从重点示范及其以后普遍建社的经验证明，建社的具体步骤，一般应是：依靠农村党的支部的领导，首先进行建社的深入宣传；由骨干和党的、非党的积极分子带头，在群众中进行建社的酝酿和建立筹备委员会，个别动员群众入社；然后，领导社员学习社章草案和民主制订本社社章，认真地进行“四评”〔注二〕；最后选举干部、制订生产计划、安排劳动组织，并立即展开生产活动。这个过程的每一个步骤都是很重要的，其中民主制订社章和认真合理地进行“四评”，则是建社步骤中贯彻政策的重要环节。从领导社员学习、讨论、拟定社章的过程中，可以使他们进一步了解办社的好处和政策，这是一个具体地深入地贯彻自愿原则的过程；也就是采用政治上民主商量的办法，经济上合理规定分配制度和使用牲口、农具的办法，在建社过程中加强贫农中农的巩固联盟。
    在民主制订社章和进行“四评”中，有些贫农常常表现了过多过急地要求增加社会主义因素的思想和平均主义思想，要求将牲口农具无代价归社、把土地产量评得过低，或把牲口农具评价过低、归还期过长。这些都是不利于团结中农的作法。有的说：“快到社会主义了，什么你的我的，早晚是大伙的。”也有些中农有追求个人发展的趋向，要求规定过高的土地分红的比例，将牲口、农具评价和利息订得过高，甚至要求规定过高的入社费，来排斥贫农，损害劳动的积极性，还说办社是“穷沾富光”。干部在领导解决这个矛盾时，应避免片面的中农观点和片面的贫农观点，应向他们进行贫农中农巩固联盟的教育，坚持贯彻贫农中农巩固联盟的政策，以奖励劳动而又照顾私有利益的精神指导解决上述问题，使个人利益和集体利益结合起来。
    民主制订生产计划，是建社阶段的结束，是生产和巩固工作的开始。要从制定生产计划中集中大家的智慧和力量，规定经营方向，寻求增产门路和措施，研究出劳力组织使用的办法，预算和细算收支，从而统一大家的思想和奠定增产的信心。
    四、为克服领导力量不足的困难，可以采用
  “老社带徒弟，新社请师傅”的办法。在定县，五十七个老社的干部曾就近帮助建立了一百二十九个新社。有些地方采用了由县区干部中有办社经验的
  “熟手”带“生手”，边作边学的办法。有些地方把有农业生产合作社基础的区乡和无基础的区乡分类排队，把有经验的干部派往无基础的地区，把缺乏经验的干部派往有基础的地区，凭借老社的帮助进行建社工作。这些办法都有助于建社工作的进展，有助于锻炼和培养干部。
    在实际运动中不断提高干部政策水平和业务能力，保证了绝大多数新建立的社都具备办好的条件：各社都有热心办社的骨干，全省约有十万党员、五万团员和五万非党基层干部参加了社。据唐山专区的调查，平均每社有十四户，其中就有七个骨干
  （平均每社大约有党员四人、青年团员二人、非党干部一人）。同时，入社自愿的原则也比过去贯彻得好。百分之八十八点九的新社是在互助组的基础上建立起来的。
    群众有热情，领导方面也摸到了经验，因之运动进展很快。二月底，已经建成和正在建立的农业生产合作社就达到了两万多个，群众、干部的热情越发高涨了，酝酿建立的新社的数目直线上升。这时候，有一些地方的干部被已经获得的成绩冲昏了头脑，产生了以多为胜、盲目追求数量的偏向，他们不顾条件地主张“再烧一把火”；在一些互助合作基础很差、条件不足的地区的领导干部，看到落在先进地区的后面，也产生了急于求成的急躁情绪。如栾城县，五天内便建立了二百多个社。容城县委采用“干部挑战”的办法推动建社，还规定
  “订社章，群众愿订什么，就订什么”，放弃了领导。草率从事的现象，越来越严重，“建起来再说”的论调，助长了这种偏向。那时，春耕快要开始了，不宜再行发展了；新建立的农业生产合作社程度不同地存在着一些问题，也迫切须要帮助解决和进行整顿，以利生产。省委就在三月初发出指示，暂停发展，力求巩固。这个指示帮助盲目追求数量的同志们的思想冷静下来。自满情绪以及不去深入了解和不愿正视新社中存在的问题的思想，受到了批判。运动转入了从生产中巩固农业生产合作社的阶段。
    在巩固中准备再前进
    根据三、四月间各地派出的工作组考察了解：约有百分之四十左右的新社，不仅具备办社条件，而且社章订得较好，“四评”合理，生产搞得起劲；约有百分之五十左右的新社，条件虽好，但社章、“四评”不够合理，生产缺乏计划，如果予以切实指导、帮助，即可初步巩固起来；约有百分之十左右的新社，条件很差，“四评”也极不合理，生产停滞，组织成分不纯，有的抛开农业大搞副业或商业，问题比较严重，其中多数须经过教育、指导，改组为互助组。上述各类新社的通病，是缺乏经营管理的经验，个别社员仍疑虑不定，耽心能否增加生产和收入。巩固工作的中心任务就是解决这些问题，扫除生产上的障碍。根据各地的经验，根本作法是从指导新社计划生产和展开生产活动入手，从政治上、经济上、组织上巩固农业生产合作社。
    为了进行巩固工作，各县都召开了一次互助合作代表会议。老社和新社的代表和部分县、区、乡干部都参加了这次会议。会议普遍地采用了“大家提问题、大家商量解决”和“新社问、老社答”等依靠群众解决问题的方法。有的县的会议上提出的有关增产和管理的具体问题达千条之多，大都用这种群众路线的方法得到解决。新社社长们说：“前头有车，后头有辙，咱们的路就好走了！”满城县的会议上创造了“三找三算”的方法，即找教训、找经验、找增产门路，算增产账、算开支账、算分配账。“三找三算”是启发和依靠社员的积极性实行民主管理的一个好办法，它引导社员从挖掘自身潜力、增产节约、搞好管理等方面，力求增加收入。在“三找三算”中又鼓励每个社把自己解决问题
  （那怕是一个小问题）的经验介绍出来，使会议真正达到了集中经验、交流经验的目的。在劳动力的组织使用问题、分配制度、民主管理、政治思想工作等方面，都交流了经验。在代表会议上，新社、老社的干部都提高了能力，县区干部也学习到不少经验。很多新社社长说：“这个会开得使人挺起腰板来了，有办法了。”沧县县委书记说：“这是最好的一课：依靠群众的智慧，就有办法。”
    为了从经济上巩固农业生产合作社，一方面，推广了“三找三算”的经验，发动各社依靠自身的力量，挖掘本社的潜力，以求增产；另一方面，曾采用各种方式给各社以必要的扶植。不少县在召开代表会议时，供销社便结合进行了货品展览和与生产社订立供销合同的工作。仅据沧县专区三个县的统计，即订立供销合同一千六百件，供销总额达四十余亿元。银行负责办理贷款，收效也很好。适量的必要的贷款、积极推行供销合同，特别是后来的棉、麦、油料、肥猪等的预购工作，直接支持了新社的生产。
    代表会议后，各县立即组织了工作组，深入各社指导、帮助解决思想的、内部关系的、经营管理的和需要经济扶植的问题。根据经验，对新社的巩固工作，必须首先解决计划管理生产的问题，这是由单干或互助组转为合作社后遇到的第一个难关。对于这个问题，必须从制订或修订生产计划和安排劳动组织两方面逐步加以解决。其次，要解决内部关系的问题，如“四评”偏高偏低、新社员和老社员的关系、反对搞商业剥削等等问题，保证农业生产合作社能够正常地健康地向前发展。事实证明，多数社员的思想常常是落后于新的生产方式的要求的，这是很多内部关系问题产生的根源。因此，解决这些问题的办法，主要是加强政治思想教育，提高社员的觉悟，同时根据党中央“关于发展农业生产合作社的决议”中有关的具体规定的原则精神与当地当时的条件，适当调整贫农和中农、劳动和私有、老社员和新社员、集体和个人的经济利益。
    在巩固工作中遇到的一个问题是新社中普遍缺乏会计人员；这成为实行计划管理的严重障碍。为了解决这个问题，省人民政府曾训练了三百多名会计教员，协助各县训练了新社会计两万三千多人。为了加强对合作社会计工作的领导，每县设一会计辅导员巡回指导会计工作的计划，正在执行中。
    经常加强对于社干部的教育，对于搞好生产和社的巩固有极其重要的意义。河北省在三、四月间曾发动新社骨干开展了一个学习耿长锁当社长的经验的运动。这个运动，是通过党报倡导、由地方党委领导进行的。耿长锁的“听党的话、大公无私、依靠大家办社、努力学习”的思想和经验，已成为很多新社干部自觉努力的方向；很多人据此作了自我检讨，并给自己订出了誓约。但在学习运动中，也有一些地方党的组织，没有认真进行领导，这是由于他们还不懂得凭借活生生的先进人物的先进思想和先进经验，进行政治思想领导的重要意义。
    克服过去以“手把壶”的方式领导办社工作的缺点，以适应农业生产合作社普遍建立后的新形势，是一个重要问题。有些县试行成功、正在普遍推行的经验是以乡为单位或以相邻的几个、十几个社为单位，组织互助合作网或联合委员会。这是社与社、社与组、组与组交流增产和管理经验的一种组织，社长和组长们称它为“诸葛亮会”。它是以党的支部为领导，以老社为骨干，由新社和互助组共同参加组成的。区干部则深入一个社作为重点，同时通过这个组织指导一般社的工作，并从中和大家一起学习。这种组织起了互相督促、检查和共同研究解决问题的作用。现在多数地区均已建立了这种组织。有一些地方，如满城、晋县、定县等地，还在这个组织内的各社各组间开展了按国家计划种植的增产竞赛运动，不仅直接有助于社和组的巩固、提高，而且有力地影响和带动了单干农民按国家计划进行种植。
    春耕开始前后的巩固工作已经见到成效。绝大多数新社的生产正蒸蒸日上，不仅作到按国家计划进行种植，而且播种迅速，较一般农民完成播种任务为早。满城二百七十七个农业生产合作社，在建社结束时一类社为八十六个，二类社为一百四十四个，三类社为四十七个。经过一个多月的整顿以后，一类社为一百九十八个，二类社为七十三个，三类社只剩下了六个。
    巩固现有的社，不只是为了目前，更重要的是为了将来。巩固现有的社，就是为社会主义改造事业的继续前进，准备下更充分的条件，对于今年秋后的合作化运动能不能健康地大发展，有直接的关系。可是，现在仍有一些干部对于巩固社的重要意义认识不足。有的说：“建起来就好，垮不了就行。”有的虽然也重视了巩固工作，但只是为了怕把现有的社办坏了受批评处分；因此，在进行了一段巩固工作获得一些成绩后，看到社垮不了，便松懈、自满和中途停止下来，不了解已进行的工作，不过是开始，巩固、提高农业生产合作社的工作是必须贯彻全年的；也不了解，要更进一步发展合作化运动，现有的基础还是不够雄厚的，还必须大大加强。
    党的领导是胜利的保证
    今年互助合作运动发展的过程，实际上也是农村各级党的组织的领导重点转到发展互助合作以提高农业生产力方面来的转变过程。凡是认真贯彻了
  “党委负责，书记动手，全党办社”的精神的地方，运动的成绩就比较好。党的积极的正确的领导，是运动稳步前进的决定条件。
    运动发展的情况和经验证明，必须从始至终正确地进行两条战线的斗争。开始的稳步不前、自流倾向的残余思想所表现的脱离群众的保守主义，和后来的胜利冲昏头脑，不顾主观客观条件，以多为胜，草率从事，因而也势必脱离群众的冒进倾向，都必须及时指出和纠正。必须严格掌握按条件办事而又爱护群众热情的精神，要满足群众建社的要求而又不得草率从事，作到既要办多又要办好。上述两种倾向产生的根源，都是主观主义；是不根据当地条件又不积极创造条件和不认识客观规律又不积极学习掌握规律的表现。
    这两种倾向的产生，也正是反映了对合作化事业的领导水平落后于运动发展的要求。目前，领导最薄弱的环节是县、区；居于运动的实际组织者和领导者地位的县区干部，多数对于互助合作运动的理论、政策和业务不熟悉，缺乏办社的经验。据天津地委的调查，全体县级干部三千余人中，熟悉办社工作的只占百分之五·六二，一知半解的占百分之十三，外行的占百分之八一·三八，区干部的情况大体相同。在运动进入巩固阶段后，邯郸地委召开的一次互助合作会议上，有的县委书记两天内一言未发，经测验，二十五个县委中，五分之二不及格。为解决这个矛盾，不应采取消极办法，用减缓必要的发展速度、压抑群众热情的办法去解决，而必须采取提高领导水平的积极办法，使领导赶上客观运动的要求。经过过去一段的工作，县、区领导情况已有改善，但问题并未彻底解决，尚须加倍努力，继续提高干部办合作化事业的能力。同时，还应注意提高基层党组织的领导水平，提高互助合作委员会、互助合作网的工作质量，以便在实践中锻炼干部、改进领导。
    〔注一〕新社数与老社数加在一起，与总数不符，这是因为有一些老社在运动中合并了。
    〔注二〕“四评”是社员入社时评土地产量高低、评牲口和农具折价多少和评劳动力工分（死分）的一种流行的简称语。按河北今春建社中的情况，实际上在建社过程中大都只进行了“三评”，评劳动力工分是在社建起来以后才进行的。
