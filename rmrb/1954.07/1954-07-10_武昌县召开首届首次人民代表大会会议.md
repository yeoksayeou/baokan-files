    Wuchang County, Hubei Province, convened its first session of the first People's Congress from June 30th to July 3rd. More than 250 delegates attended the meeting. In addition to reviewing the work of Wuchang County in the past and discussing and deciding on future tasks, they particularly and conscientiously discussed the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China and unanimously expressed their determination to support the Draft Constitution with practical actions.
    Wuchang County bears the important task of directly supporting the industrial construction of Wuhan City. The people's representatives attending the meeting had a particularly deep understanding of the benefits of national industrialization from their personal experiences over the past few years since liberation and from studying the General Line. The representatives unanimously believed that the Draft Constitution guarantees the realization of socialist industrialization in our country, and therefore, it is a constitution that truly reflects the demands and aspirations of the people. Xiang Benhua, a people's representative from Lijiabao Township, said: "The farmers in our township see tractors, seeders, and weeding machines working in the fields of nearby farms every day, and their efficiency is much greater than if we did it manually. Last year, the People's Government used seven water pumps to help our township overcome the difficulty of water shortage in more than 1,000 mu of fields, so production was not affected. These things make everyone see the benefits of industrialization and want to industrialize sooner. Now the Draft Constitution stipulates that the country's socialist industrialization should be realized, and we will be more guaranteed when we reach socialist society." People's Representative Wang Shengqun said: "In the past few years, farmers in the township have been wearing foreign cloth, and every family uses thermos bottles. This is the result of the working class elder brothers making more machines and more daily necessities to supply to the farmers, and helping the farmers to develop production."
    In order to support the Draft Constitution with practical actions, the meeting conscientiously discussed how to support national industrialization. The meeting unanimously resolved that, first of all, the Draft Constitution must be widely publicized and the people must be organized to discuss it throughout the county. In rural areas, the mutual aid and cooperation movement must continue to be carried out to transform the small-peasant economy and bring the individual economy into the orbit of the national planned economy. The whole county should strive to develop 160 to 200 agricultural producers' cooperatives and a large number of mutual aid teams this winter and next spring. In the areas along the rivers, we must do our best to ensure a safe passage through this year's flood season, and do our best to do a good job in production and strive for a bumper harvest. It is necessary to further implement the state's policy of planned purchase and planned supply of agricultural products to ensure the supply to the urban and rural people.

    武昌县召开首届首次人民代表大会会议
    湖北省武昌县在六月三十日到七月三日召开了第一届第一次人民代表大会会议。到会的二百五十多个代表，除审查了武昌县过去的工作并讨论、决定了今后的任务外，特别认真地讨论了中华人民共和国宪法草案，一致表示要以实际行动拥护宪法草案。
    武昌县担负着直接支援武汉市工业建设的重大任务。参加会议的人民代表从解放后几年来的亲身体验和对总路线的学习中，对国家工业化的好处有着特别深刻的体会。代表们一致认为，宪法草案保证了我国实现社会主义工业化，因此，这是一部真正反映人民要求和愿望的宪法。李家桥乡人民代表向本华说：“我们乡里农民天天看到附近农场里的拖拉机、播种机、锄草机在田里干活，效率比我们用人工干要大得多。去年，人民政府用七部抽水机帮我们乡里克服了一千多亩田缺水的困难，使生产没受影响。这些事情都使大家看到工业化的好处，想早一天工业化。现在宪法草案规定要实现国家的社会主义工业化，我们到社会主义社会就更有保障了。”人民代表王胜群说：“这几年乡里农民都穿上洋布，家家都用热水瓶，这都是工人老大哥多造机器多造日用品供给农民，并且帮助农民发展生产的结果。”
    为了用实际行动拥护宪法草案，会议认真地讨论了如何支援国家工业化的问题。会议一致决议：首先必须在全县范围内广泛宣传和组织人民讨论宪法草案。在农村中必须继续开展互助合作运动，改造小农经济，使个体经济纳入国家计划经济的轨道。全县争取今冬明春发展一百六十到二百个农业生产合作社和大量互助组。在沿江沿河地区要全力保证安全渡过今年大汛，并尽力搞好生产，争取丰收。要进一步贯彻国家对农产品的计划收购和计划供应政策，以保证对城乡人民的供应。
