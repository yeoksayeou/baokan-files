Chong'an County, Fujian Province, Party and government leading organs are strengthening leadership over areas that are remote and have weak work foundations.

Chong'an County is mountainous, and the villages in remote areas are mostly located in deep mountains and dense forests, generally eighty or ninety li or more away from the county seat, accessible only by rugged paths. These areas have scattered villages, with a township of two to three hundred households often divided into more than one hundred natural villages. After various movements since liberation, agriculture and local specialty production have recovered and developed in these areas, and the masses' awareness has also increased. However, the foundation of work remains relatively weak, and the production and living conditions of the masses are far behind those of ordinary villages. In some areas, there are still counter-revolutionary remnants secretly engaging in sabotage activities. In order to gradually balance the development of the county's work, the Chong'an County Party Committee recently held an enlarged meeting of the County Party Committee to comprehensively study the issue of strengthening work in weak areas and formulated a comprehensive plan. The county's political and legal, financial and economic, cultural and educational departments, and mass organizations have also separately formulated plans to support and cooperate with this work.

Recently, the county has dispatched fifteen county and district-level cadres to form two work teams, which are going to two base-point townships in remote areas to lead the masses in developing production and mutual aid and cooperation. After gaining experience, another group of cadres will be sent to work in other remote villages.

Remote mountain villages have many local specialties, but they cannot be transported out due to inconvenient transportation. Recently, the county People's Government allocated more than 100 million yuan to help the masses build four mountain roads and nine bridges. State-owned commercial departments and supply and marketing cooperatives have dispatched a group of cadres to set up purchasing stations for local specialties such as crude paper and dried bamboo shoots, as well as supply stations for production and living materials, in marginal areas such as Kengkou, Nanyan, and Baishui. The Chong'an Purchasing Station of the Provincial Forestry Industry Bureau has strengthened the purchase of timber from remote areas and improved the method of transporting it.

    福建省崇安县加强对偏僻乡村工作的领导
    福建省崇安县党政领导机关加强对地处偏僻、工作薄弱地区的领导。
    崇安县内山岭起伏，偏僻地区的乡村大都处在深山密林中，一般都离开县城八、九十里以上，只有崎岖的小道可通。这些地方村落分散，两三百户的一个乡往往分成一百多个自然村。解放以后经过各种运动，这些地区农业和土特产生产虽有恢复和发展，群众觉悟也有了提高，但工作基础仍比较薄弱，群众生产和生活仍远远赶不上一般乡村，在个别地区还有反革命残余暗中进行破坏活动。为了使全县工作逐渐平衡发展，中共崇安县委会不久前召开了一次县委扩大会议，全面研究了加强薄弱地区工作的问题，并订出了通盘计划。县的政法、财经、文教等部门及群众团体也分别订出了支援与配合这一工作的计划。
    最近，该县已派出县区级干部十五人，组成两个工作队，分赴偏僻地区的两个基点乡，领导群众发展生产和互助合作。等到取得经验后，将再派一批干部到其他偏僻乡村去工作。
    偏僻山村有不少土特产，但因交通不便，无法外运。最近，县人民政府拨款一亿多元，帮助群众修建四段山路和九座桥梁。国营商业部门与供销合作社派出了一批干部到坑口、南严、白水等边缘地区设立土纸、筍干等土特产收购站和生产、生活资料的供应站。省森林工业局崇安采购站已加强向偏僻地区收购木材和改进流放办法。
