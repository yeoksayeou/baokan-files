The Gansu Provincial Company of the China National Animal By-Products Import & Export Corporation, in order to expand sources of export goods, organized nineteen work teams in May to go deep into the midst of farmers and herdsmen to teach cashmere harvesting techniques, and has already made considerable achievements.

In the past, with the exception of the Qingyang Special District, the masses in other areas of the province generally did not pay attention to cashmere production, and wasted a great deal of cashmere. This time, the work teams went to the countryside and first used methods such as calculating detailed accounts to explain the benefits of cashmere production to farmers and herdsmen. Many farmers and herdsmen actively requested to learn the techniques of cashmere harvesting. The work team in Peijiaying, Jiuquan County, taught 107 farmers and herdsmen in eight days. Now, many farmers and herdsmen are requesting to buy iron combs (tools for harvesting cashmere). The Gansu Provincial Company of the China National Animal By-Products Import & Export Corporation has organized local handicraftsmen to rush-produce more than 1,500 iron combs and handed them over to various work teams for on-site supply. Due to the widespread mastery of cashmere harvesting techniques by farmers and herdsmen, this year's province-wide cashmere production is estimated to increase sixfold compared to previous years.

    甘肃畜产公司派干部下乡传授抓羊绒技术
    今年全省的羊绒产量将比往年增加六倍
    中国畜产公司甘肃省公司为了扩大出口货源，于五月间组织十九个工作组深入农民、牧民中间传授抓羊绒的技术，现已作出不少成绩。
    过去除庆阳专区外，该省其他地区的群众一般都不重视羊绒生产，将许多羊绒浪费了。这次工作组下乡，首先用算细账等办法向农民、牧民说明了生产羊绒的好处，许多农民、牧民主动要求学习抓羊绒的技术。到酒泉县裴家营的工作组在八天内就教会了一百零七个农民和牧民。现在，许多农民和牧民要求买铁抓子（抓羊绒的工具）。中国畜产公司甘肃省公司已组织当地手工业者赶制了一千五百多把铁抓子，交给各工作组，就地进行供应。由于广大农民、牧民掌握了抓羊绒的技术，今年全省羊绒产量估计将比往年的产量增加六倍。
