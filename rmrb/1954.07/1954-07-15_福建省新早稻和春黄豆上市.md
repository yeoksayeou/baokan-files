    New Early Rice and Spring Soybeans from Fujian Province Enter the Market
    Early rice and spring soybeans from Longxi, Zhangzhou, Changtai, Nanjing, Pinghe, Haicheng, Minqing, Putian and other counties and cities in Fujian Province have entered the market. Local grain departments and supply and marketing cooperatives have promptly started procurement work.
    In the Jiulong River basin, the main early rice producing area in Fujian Province, counties such as Longxi and Haicheng have had good early rice harvests this year. Farmers are now enthusiastically selling early rice to the state. In Shima, Longxi County, the state purchases more than 50,000 jin of early rice every day; in the second and fourth districts of the county, farmers sold more than 50,000 jin of new early rice to the state on July 1 alone. In Putian, Gutian and other counties, the main soybean producing areas, the amount of spring soybeans sold by farmers is also gradually increasing. (Cheng Hua)

    福建省新早稻和春黄豆上市
    福建省龙溪、漳州、长泰、南靖、平和、海澄、闽清、莆田等县、市已有早稻及春黄豆上市，当地粮食部门和供销合作社及时展开收购工作。
    福建省早稻主要产区九龙江流域的龙溪、海澄等县今年早稻收成良好，农民们现正踊跃把早稻卖给国家。在龙溪县石码一个地方，国家每天收购早稻五万斤以上；该县第二区和第四区的农民在七月一日一天，就卖给国家五万余斤新早稻。在黄豆主要产地莆田、古田等县，农民出售春黄豆的数量也正在逐渐增加。　（程华）
