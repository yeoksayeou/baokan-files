    【Fujian Daily Special Dispatch】The meetings of the People's Congresses in seventy counties and cities of Fujian Province concluded on July 2nd. More than twelve thousand four hundred representatives enthusiastically discussed the draft constitution. After the discussion, the representatives unanimously expressed their support for the draft constitution. Chen Sangu, a representative from Longyan County who persisted in the revolutionary struggle in western Fujian and was arrested six times, still has a three-inch-long scar on her left arm due to torture by the reactionaries. After reading the draft constitution, Chen Sangu said excitedly, "Our people in the old revolutionary base areas have been fighting and shedding blood for decades under the leadership of the Communist Party, just to win the victory of the people." Lin Guanghua, a representative from Yiyu Township in the old revolutionary base area of Luoyuan, said, "More than 300 people in our township sacrificed themselves in the struggle against the landlords and the Kuomintang reactionaries. Seeing the draft constitution, we feel that their blood was not shed in vain." Lei Shizhu, a representative of the ethnic minorities who participated in the second delegation to Korea to offer condolences, said at the Luoyuan People's Congress meeting: "Before liberation, eighty out of a hundred families of our She ethnic group could not make ends meet, and we dared not say loudly that our surnames were Lei, Zhong, or Lan when we went out. Now, seventy out of a hundred families have surplus grain, and our She ethnic group now has its own representatives. We are as glorious as everyone else. We She ethnic group have today's life because Chairman Mao pulled us out of the deep pit after liberation." Lei Horen, a representative of the ethnic minorities in Guangze County, said: "Before liberation, let alone political rights, we didn't even have the opportunity for our children to go to school. After liberation, the people's government set up primary schools for us, and this year it allocated funds to repair the school buildings. Our children are all going to school now. We fully support the articles in the draft constitution concerning our ethnic minorities." Jiang Asan, a representative from the coastal county of Xiapu, said, "The Kuomintang did not treat us coastal people as human beings. Today, all one hundred and six articles of our draft constitution are for the benefit of the people, and we coastal people are also protected. We are really happy to see this." The representatives from the overseas Chinese areas in southern Fujian felt even warmer and more lovable about their motherland after discussing the draft constitution. Li Wuxiang, a representative of the Malaysian Chinese visiting group, a member of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, and chairman of the Nan'an County Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, said with emotion: "The Kuomintang reactionaries did not care about the lives and deaths of overseas Chinese. The consulates and embassies they set up specialized in extorting money from overseas Chinese. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, it has played an important role in international affairs, and overseas Chinese are not afraid of being persecuted by others abroad." The representatives of overseas Chinese families in Shishi Town, Jinjiang, all felt honored to be citizens of the People's Republic of China. At present, representatives from various places have begun to convey the draft constitution. There are as many as one thousand five hundred and eighty-six representatives from the Longxi area going to the countryside. Changle County has conducted publicity in forty-three townships. More than three thousand one hundred reporters have been trained throughout the province. Most counties have held representative meetings of propagandists and trained backbone propagandists. The province is about to widely launch publicity and discussion on the draft constitution.

    福建省七十个县、市人民代表大会代表
    热烈讨论宪法草案一致表示欢迎
    【福建日报专电】福建省七十个县、市的人民代表大会会议，到七月二日已全部结束，一万二千四百多个代表热烈讨论了宪法草案。讨论后，代表们一致表示拥护宪法草案。在闽西坚持革命斗争、曾被捕六次的龙岩县代表陈三姑，因受反动派的酷刑，至今左臂仍有三寸长的伤痕。陈三姑看了宪法草案后，兴奋地说：“我们老区人民在共产党领导下流血斗争几十年，就是为的争取人民的胜利。”罗源老区异屿乡代表林光华说：“我乡人民在反对地主和国民党反动派的斗争中，牺牲了三百多人。看到宪法草案后，使我们感到他们的鲜血没有白流。”少数民族代表、曾参加第二届赴朝慰问团的雷世珠在罗源人民代表大会会议上发言说：“解放前，我们畬族一百家有八十家吃饭上顿顾不了下顿，跑出去不敢大声讲自己姓雷、姓钟、姓兰。现在一百家有七十家有余粮，我们畬族现在也有了自己的代表，我们和大家一样光荣。我们畬族有今天的日子，是因为解放后毛主席把我们从深坑里拉起来了。”光泽县少数民族代表雷和仁说：“解放前不要说政治权利，连孩子上学的机会也没有。解放后人民政府给我们办小学，今年又拨款修校舍，我们的子女都上学了。宪法草案中规定的有关我们少数民族的几条，我们完全拥护。”沿海的霞浦县代表江阿三说：“国民党拿我们海边上的人不当人看。今天我们的宪法草案一百零六条，全是为着人民利益，我们海边上的人也得到保护，看了真高兴。”闽南侨区的代表们讨论了宪法草案后，更加感到祖国的温暖和可爱。马来亚华侨回国观光团代表、全国工商业联合会委员、南安县侨联主席李五香感慨地说：“国民党反动派不管华侨死活，所设使领馆专敲华侨的竹杠。中华人民共和国成立后，已在国际事务中起着重要的作用，华侨在外不怕别人迫害了。”晋江石狮镇的侨属代表们都以自己能当一个中华人民共和国的公民而感到光荣。目前各地代表已开始传达宪法草案，光龙溪专区下乡代表就达一千五百八十六人。长乐县已在四十三个乡进行传达。全省已训练报告员三千一百多人。大部分县已开过宣传员代表会，训练了宣传员骨干。全省即将广泛展开对宪法草案的宣传和讨论。
