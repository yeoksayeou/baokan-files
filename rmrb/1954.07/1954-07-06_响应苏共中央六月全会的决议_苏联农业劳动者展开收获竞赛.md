    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 5th. In most parts of the Soviet Union, the winter crops are being harvested intensively. Spring crops in the southern regions are also nearing maturity. At present, agricultural workers in various regions are responding to the resolution of the June Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and are extensively launching a socialist competition to harvest crops in a timely manner and without loss.
    In various parts of the Kazakh Republic, barley, wheat and other crops are being harvested. The Zhenashal Machine Tractor Station in the Almaty Oblast discussed the resolution of the June Plenum of the CPSU Central Committee. Combine operator Degtabev said: How much grain the Kazakh Republic can produce for the country depends on the quality of our work. We should not lose a single kilogram of grain in the fields during the harvest. The combine operators of this machine tractor station accepted his suggestion and decided to complete the grain harvest of the collective farms they serve in twenty-two to twenty-five days. On the Kuban prairie, the machine operators of various machine tractor stations are responding to the initiative of Gontal, the hero of socialist labor, and have decided to harvest 400 hectares of grain (15 mu per hectare) with each combine in twelve days and thresh 11,000 quintals of grain (200 jin per quintal). Now, the combine operators have started the combines and are setting off to the fields one after another. The Sagipilov Machine Tractor Station in the Kharkov Oblast of the Ukrainian Republic has added many new-style combines this year, which will not only improve the mechanization of the harvest work, but also greatly shorten the harvest period. The combine operators decided to complete the harvest work in eighteen days. In addition, news of the extensive agricultural laborers responding to the resolution of the June Plenum of the CPSU Central Committee and launching a harvest competition has also come from the Don River Basin, the Baltic coast, and various Union Republics in Central Asia.

    响应苏共中央六月全会的决议
    苏联农业劳动者展开收获竞赛
    【新华社莫斯科五日电】苏联大部地区正在紧张地收获冬播作物。南部地区的春播作物也快要成熟了。目前各地农业劳动者正在响应苏联共产党中央委员会六月全体会议的决议，广泛展开及时和无损失地收获作物的社会主义竞赛。
    哈萨克共和国各地都在收获大麦、小麦等作物。阿拉木图州热纳夏尔机器拖拉机站讨论了苏共中央六月全会的决议。联合机手杰格塔别夫说：哈萨克共和国能为国家生产多少粮食，要看我们的工作好坏而定。我们在收获时应使一公斤粮食也不损失在田里。这个机器拖拉机站的联合机手们接受了他的建议，决定要在二十二天到二十五天内把他们所服务的各集体农庄的谷物收获完毕。在库班草原上，各个机器拖拉机站的机器操使者们都在响应社会主义劳动英雄冈塔尔的倡议，决定在十二天内用每台联合机收获四百公顷谷物（每公顷合十五市亩），打一万一千公担粮食（一公担合二百市斤）。现在，联合机手们已开动联合机陆续出发到田野上去了。乌克兰共和国哈尔科夫州萨吉彼洛夫机器拖拉机站今年补充了许多新式的联合机，这不但能够提高收获工作的机械化程度，而且可以大大缩短收获的期限。联合机手们决定在十八天内完成收获工作。此外，从顿河流域，从波罗的海沿岸和中亚细亚各加盟共和国，也传来广大农业劳动者响应苏共中央六月全会的决议展开收获竞赛的消息。
