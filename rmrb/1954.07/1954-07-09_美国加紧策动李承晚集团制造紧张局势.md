Xinhua News Agency, July 7th: The American authorities, who sabotaged the Geneva Conference negotiations on the Korean issue, are intensifying their efforts to instigate the Syngman Rhee group to threaten the stability of the Korean armistice and create tension in the Far East.

The provocative war cries emanating from Seoul are becoming increasingly frantic. According to Western news agencies, Syngman Rhee made another statement on the 6th, openly demanding that his American masters issue an "ultimatum" to the Korean and Chinese side, threatening to extend Syngman Rhee's reactionary regime to North Korea, otherwise he would use "all weapons at his disposal" to wage a "decisive battle." Syngman Rhee also demanded that his masters "arm South Korea with modern equipment." He openly clamored that "the armistice agreement is no longer an obstacle to achieving this." Three days earlier, South Korean Foreign Minister Byun Young-tae also issued a threat, saying that South Korea was no longer bound by the armistice agreement and had the "freedom" to take any action it deemed necessary to "unify" Korea. At the same time, South Korean Ambassador to the United States, Liang Youchang, also clamored in Washington, saying, "Now, peaceful means have failed." He demanded that the United States expand the Syngman Rhee puppet army and increase military "aid" to South Korea. He hysterically shouted, "Give us guns, and we will provide soldiers," to sell their lives for the United States to launch new wars of aggression in Asia.

At the same time, the Syngman Rhee group is stepping up the expansion of its puppet army to increase its capital for launching new military adventures and creating tensions. According to Western news agencies, South Korean Army Chief of Staff Chung Il-kwon announced on the 5th that the first phase of the South Korean government's plan to establish a large reserve force will begin on July 10th, and all graduating university students and middle school students will be called up to participate in the military training under the first phase of the plan. Chung Il-kwon also stated that the South Korean government would establish several reserve divisions, stationed in various parts of South Korea for training.

In order to instigate the Syngman Rhee group to carry out sabotage activities, the American authorities recently summoned Syngman Rhee to Washington for negotiations to discuss military and political issues. Syngman Rhee has agreed to first send Minister of Defense Son Won-il to Washington in the next few days to receive orders from the American authorities. At the same time, following the busy activities of former commander of the U.S. Eighth Army in Korea, Van Fleet, in South Korea, Commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, Stump, arrived in South Korea on July 2nd for secret talks with Syngman Rhee.

The joint statements issued by the Prime Ministers of China and India and the Prime Ministers of China and Burma have greatly encouraged the peaceful efforts of the Asian people and strengthened their confidence in maintaining peace and security in Asia. The American ruling group is very afraid of this. Therefore, this new instigation by the American authorities is clearly an attempt to use the intimidation and clamor of the Syngman Rhee group to deepen the instability of the Korean armistice, so as to maintain tension in the Far East and counter the efforts of the Asian people to maintain peace and security in Asia. This conspiracy of the American ruling group, which is hostile to the peaceful efforts of the Asian people, will inevitably arouse greater anger and opposition from the Asian people and all peace-loving people in the world. They cannot intimidate others, they can only create more difficulties for themselves.

### 美国加紧策动李承晚集团制造紧张局势

    美国加紧策动李承晚集团制造紧张局势
    【新华社七日讯】破坏了日内瓦会议关于朝鲜问题谈判的美国当局，正在加紧策动李承晚集团来威胁朝鲜停战的稳定和制造远东的紧张局势。
    从汉城发出的挑衅性的战争叫嚣，越来越疯狂了。据西方通讯社报道，李承晚又在六日发表谈话，公然要求他的美国主子对朝中方面提出“最后通牒”，威胁要让李承晚的反动政权扩展到北朝鲜去，否则就要使用“所掌握的一切武器”进行“决战”。李承晚还要求他的主子“用现代化的装备把南朝鲜武装起来”。他公然叫嚣说，“停战协定现在已不再是做到这一点的障碍了。”在这以前三天，南朝鲜外务部长官卞荣泰也发出威胁说，南朝鲜已经不受停战协定的约束，它有“自由”采取它认为必要的任何行动来“统一”朝鲜。同时，南朝鲜驻美国的大使梁祐灿也在华盛顿发出叫嚣说，“现在，和平的办法已经行不通了。”他要求美国扩充李承晚傀儡军队，增加对南朝鲜的军事“援助”。他歇斯底里地叫喊说，“给我们枪炮，而我们将提供士兵”，来为美国在亚洲发动新的侵略战争卖命。
    同时，李承晚集团正在加紧扩充傀儡军队，增加发动新的军事冒险和制造紧张局势的资本。据西方通讯社报道，南朝鲜陆军参谋长丁一权在五日宣布，南朝鲜政府建立庞大的后备队的计划的第一阶段将在七月十日开始实施，所有的大学毕业班的学生和中学生都要被召集参加第一阶段计划中的军事训练。丁一权还表示，南朝鲜政府将建立若干后备师，分驻在南朝鲜各地进行训练。
    为了策动李承晚集团进行破坏活动，美国当局已在最近召唤李承晚到华盛顿去进行谈判，讨论军事和政治问题。李承晚已经答应首先派遣国防部长官孙元一在最近几天内赶到华盛顿去，接受美国当局的命令。同时，继前侵朝美军第八军军长范佛里特在南朝鲜进行忙忙碌碌的活动以后，美国太平洋舰队司令斯图普又在七月二日赶到南朝鲜去和李承晚进行秘密会谈。
    中印两国总理和中缅两国总理分别发表的联合声明，极大地鼓舞了亚洲人民的和平努力，加强了他们为维护亚洲和平和安全的信心。美国统治集团对此非常害怕，因此，美国当局的这种新策动，显然是企图利用李承晚集团的恫吓叫嚣来加深朝鲜停战的不稳定状态，以便保持远东紧张局势，并对抗亚洲人民为维护亚洲和平和安全的努力。美国统治集团这种与亚洲人民的和平努力为敌的阴谋，必然会引起亚洲人民和全世界爱好和平人民更大的愤怒和反对。他们不能吓倒别人，只能替自己造成更多困难。
