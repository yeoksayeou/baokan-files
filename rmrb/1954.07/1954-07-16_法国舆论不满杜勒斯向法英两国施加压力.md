Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, July 14th: French newspapers on the 14th continued to comment on Dulles' separate meetings with the French Foreign Minister and the British Foreign Secretary in Paris, instead of returning to Geneva to participate in the Indochina issue negotiations.

    Gaudard, in "L'Humanité," said of Dulles: "To return (to Geneva) would be to admit that his initial avoidance was wrong. Not to return risks a peace agreement being reached. But this may also have one advantage, namely, that the United States does not necessarily have to be associated with a peace agreement, so that it can carry out provocations at will in the future."
    Gaudard continued: "The (Geneva) negotiations are progressing, and opinions are gradually converging. The 'threat of peace' (for the United States) is becoming more and more serious... Undoubtedly, it is this 'threat of peace' that prompted Mr. Dulles to go to Paris to try to shatter the fervent hopes of the people of all countries during the Western Three-Power talks.

    "The American Secretary of State went to Paris because the Geneva Conference was proceeding so smoothly. Upon his arrival at the airport, he immediately announced the two key points of his blackmail: to rearm Germany and to establish, at all costs, the American military aggression system in Asia known as the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.

    "In short, Mr. Dulles' arguments can be briefly summarized as follows: either obtain a peace in Indochina that is acceptable to the United States, or soon we will present you with the fait accompli of a rearmed Germany, and we will make Bao Dai the Syngman Rhee of Vietnam.

    "At first glance, the means of pressure possessed by the American Secretary of State seem to be numerous, but if you carefully examine these means, you will realize that it is entirely possible to thoroughly defeat this huge intimidation.

    "The French government holds trump cards, as long as it is willing to use them, that is to say, as long as it relies on the support of French public opinion to express its determination to achieve a peace in Indochina that is acceptable to France, regardless of whether this is to Mr. Dulles' liking."
    "Libération" wrote: "When it is a question of a foreign ministers' conference, one of these foreign ministers—but not the least important among them—holds separate talks with some of his colleagues outside the conference... In any case, it is already known that American pressure exists."
    The "Combat" of the 13th wrote that the American ruling clique is unhappy with the French government's pursuit of peace in Indochina. "Undoubtedly, Mr. Dulles came to Paris to express America's unease, because the Washington government fears that peace will be achieved in Indochina." "Combat" added: "The slightest understanding of the difficulties encountered in a war against an allied nation would help it in delicate negotiations. It is noteworthy that the American leaders disregard France's right to pursue its own policies, because if Mendès-France concludes a glorious armistice agreement as we hope, it would be tantamount to showing that blind obedience to Washington's instructions is not necessarily consistent with France's national interests."

    法国舆论不满杜勒斯向法英两国施加压力
    【新华社日内瓦十四日电】法国报纸十四日继续就杜勒斯在巴黎和法国外长以及英国外交大臣举行单独会谈而不回日内瓦去参加印度支那问题谈判一事发表评论。
    古达德在“人道报”上谈到杜勒斯说：“回到（日内瓦）即是承认他在起初逃避的方式是错误的。不回来会冒和平协议达成的危险。但是这也可能有一个好处，就是美国不必非与和平协议发生联系不可，因而它在将来就可以随便进行挑衅。”
    古达德接着说：“（日内瓦）谈判正在获得进展，双方的意见渐趋接近，（对于美国来说的）‘和平的威胁’越来越严重了……。毫无疑问，正是这种‘和平的威胁’才使杜勒斯先生决定到巴黎去设法在西方三国会谈中破灭各国人民的热切希望。
    美国国务卿是由于日内瓦会议进行得很顺利才到巴黎去的。当他到达机场以后立即便宣布了他的讹诈的两个要点：重新武装德国，并且不惜一切代价建立所谓东南亚公约的美国在亚洲的军事侵略体系。
    简言之，杜勒斯先生的论据可以扼要地叙述如下：要就是在印度支那获得美国所能接受的和平，否则，不久我们便将以重新武装德国的既成事实摆在你们面前，我们还将使保大成为越南的李承晚。
    乍一看来，美国国务卿所拥有的压力手段好像很不少，但是，如果你对这种手段仔细地观察一下，你就能知道要彻底击破这种巨大的恫吓是十分可能的。
    法国政府是握有王牌的，只要它愿意利用这些王牌，也就是说，只要它依靠法国舆论的支持来表示它决心在印度支那获得法国所能接受的和平，而不管这是不是杜勒斯先生所喜欢的。”
      “解放报”写道：“当这是一个外长会议的问题的时候，这些外长中的一个——但并不是他们中间的最不重要的一个——却和他的某些同僚们在会外举行单独会谈……。无论如何，人们已经知道，美国的压力是存在着的。”
    十三日的“战斗报”写道：美国统治集团对于法国政府谋求印度支那和平感到不快。“毫无疑问，杜勒斯先生到巴黎来是来表示美国的不安的。因为华盛顿政府害怕和平在印度支那实现。”“战斗报”又说：“若对一个盟国进行战争所遭到的困难有最初步的了解的话，那便会在微妙的谈判中给它以帮助。令人注意的是：美国的领导者无视法国奉行自己的政策的权利。因为如果孟戴斯—弗朗斯能像我们所希望那样缔结了光荣的停战协定，那就无异表明，盲目屈从于华盛顿的指令，是并不一定和法国的民族利益一致的。”
