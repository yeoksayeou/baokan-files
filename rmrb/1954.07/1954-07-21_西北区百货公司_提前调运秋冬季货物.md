    Northwest District Department Store
    Moves Autumn and Winter Goods in Advance
    Based on the characteristics of transportation and climate in the Northwest region, department stores in the Northwest region are transferring autumn and winter goods in advance. The Northwest District Company of China Department Store has already transferred a batch of goods such as blankets, uniform cloth, camel hair, and wool yarn from department store supply stations in Shanghai, Tianjin, Wuxi, and other places, and at the same time organized the processing of a batch of commodities such as sweaters, leather cotton shoes, cloth cotton shoes, knitted scarves, and women's velvet hats. The Xinjiang Provincial Company of China Department Store, because of the long freight transport lines in the province, began in May to transfer goods such as corduroy uniforms, crotin, cotton-padded coats, and flannel outerwear from Shanghai. The Xi'an Municipal Company of China Department Store also held a meeting on July 1 to study the processing of winter cotton clothing.

    西北区百货公司
    提前调运秋冬季货物
    西北地区的百货公司根据西北区交通、气候的特点，提前调运秋、冬季货物。中国百货公司西北区公司现已由上海、天津、无锡等地的百货供应站调进一批毛毯、制服呢、骆驼绒、毛线等货物，同时组织加工了一批毛衣、皮棉鞋、布棉鞋、线围巾和女绒帽等商品。中国百货公司新疆省公司因为该省货物运输线长，在五月份就开始从上海调进灯芯绒制服、克罗丁和棉短大衣、绒外衣等商品。中国百货公司西安市公司也在七月一日召开会议，研究了冬季棉衣的加工问题。
