Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, July 8th: The talks between Premier Zhou Enlai and the Prime Ministers of India and Burma continue to be welcomed by Burmese and Ceylonese newspapers.

    The newly published "Burma Star" published a commentary entitled "An Asian Charter," saying, "It means that Asians themselves can best handle Asian affairs." The joint statement of the Sino-Indian and Sino-Burmese Prime Ministers "shows the beginning of a perfect relationship between China and India and Burma."

    The "Rangoon Daily" studied the possibility of resolving the Indochina issue through negotiations, saying, "Asian countries will generally welcome the realization of peace in this region."

    The "Ceylon Observer" (evening edition) welcomed the joint statements of the Sino-Indian and Sino-Burmese Prime Ministers, and believed that the People's Republic of China should "obtain its due position among the other major powers in the world."

    Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, July 7th: Indonesian newspapers continue to comment on the great significance of Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to India.

    The "Sunday Messenger" recently stated: Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to India is an extremely important event in the history of Southeast Asia. The newspaper said that Asian countries should conclude non-aggression treaties based on the example of the Sino-Indian agreement on trade and communication between China's Tibet region and India, in order to counter the imperialists' war delusions. The newspaper said that such an agreement, concluded according to the five guiding principles, would thwart the imperialists' conspiracy of aggression.

    An editorial in "Indonesia News" stated: "The talks held by these two Asian Prime Ministers demonstrate to the world the very obvious sincerity and peaceful intentions of Eastern countries in peacefully resolving international disputes. This understanding is of very great significance for other Asian countries such as Ceylon and Indonesia."

    "Merdeka" said that the talks between Zhou Enlai and Nehru were different from any previous meeting held by Western countries to discuss the fate of Asia. The newspaper compared the talks to Churchill and Eisenhower's Washington meeting, and pointed out that the talks between the Chinese and Indian Prime Ministers were very friendly.

     "Merdeka" pointed out that the United States is now in an awkward position. It still refuses to recognize the People's Republic of China. But facts have proven that the People's Republic of China is playing an important role in international affairs. This has been proven not only in the Korean War, but also in the Geneva Conference.

    The Indonesian "People's Daily" said in a commentary on the 5th that the Delhi talks powerfully demonstrate the growing strength of the peace and democracy camp, and the increasing unity of the Asian people in defending Asian peace and security.

    The "People's Daily" said that the talks between Zhou Enlai and Nehru are of extremely great significance for safeguarding Asian peace. The issues discussed are the issues of the Asian countries themselves. These issues are how to safeguard Asian peace and security, how to safeguard the national independence of Asian countries, and how to oppose interference in the internal affairs of Asian countries.

     The "People's Daily" finally mentioned the Washington talks, pointing out that the Washington talks have nothing in common with the Asian people's desire for peace. The newspaper said: "The communique they issued after the talks cannot conceal the aggressive intentions and the fact that the United States is becoming increasingly isolated and the imperialist camp is becoming increasingly weakened."

    Xinhua News Agency, July 7th: The Australian "Guardian" published an editorial on the 1st, saying: "The talks between the Chinese and Indian Prime Ministers present a friendly atmosphere, which is the prelude to a new stage of peaceful cooperation between two large countries with a total population of 960 million."

    The editorial emphasized: Without the participation of hundreds of millions of Asian people, no major issues concerning Asia and the Pacific can be resolved. The editorial then commented on the United States' attitude towards the People's Republic of China, saying: In the past five years, the behavior of the U.S. government has seemed very much like an ostrich, "This Washington ostrich believes that by sticking its head in the sand, it can pretend that the great People's Republic of China does not exist."

    Xinhua News Agency, July 7th: The Australian "Tribune" believes that any country that truly seeks peace in Asia cannot ignore the People's Republic of China. The "Tribune" recently stated in an editorial: "For any country seeking peace in Asia and the Pacific, the first indispensable thing in its policy is to establish normal diplomatic relations with China."

    The editorial pointed out that the experience of the Geneva Conference proves that China must be present in negotiations on major issues related to peace and war.

    The editorial criticized the United States for attempting to disregard the policy of the People's Republic of China, and pointed out: The United States has become more isolated as a result of taking this foolish action.

    Xinhua News Agency, July 8th: According to Indian News Agency: The Indian weekly "Colonial Times" in Nairobi, the capital of Kenya, Central Africa, said on the 3rd that the talks between the Prime Ministers of China and India, which have a population of 960 million, is a major event in history. The newspaper said, "Their voices and purposes are consistent: they will promote world peace."

    Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, July 8th: Many British and European newspapers and weeklies have continued to enthusiastically comment on Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to India and Burma from various perspectives over the past week. The newspapers believe that Premier Zhou Enlai's visit is an expression of the growing friendship between the peoples of China, India, and Burma. The newspapers all emphasized the warm welcome Premier Zhou Enlai received in India and Burma.

    The British "Economist" weekly said on the 3rd that it was a "historic meeting." The West German "Nuremberg News" wrote on June 29th that the joint statement of the Chinese and Indian Prime Ministers shows that "the purpose of the talks between the two politicians is to promote a peaceful solution to the Indochina War." A message in the Swiss "Berner Tagblatt" on June 30th said, "The talks between Prime Minister Nehru and Premier Zhou Enlai are the strongest indication to date that Western dominance over Asia is coming to an end."

    The newspapers also prominently published the five guiding principles on Sino-Indian and Sino-Burmese relations stipulated in the joint statements of the Sino-Indian and Sino-Burmese Prime Ministers, and expressed their approval. A commentary in the Bonn newspaper "Allgemeine Zeitung" on June 29th stated: "This shows the world that peaceful coexistence of various societies is possible despite differences in social and political systems. If these principles are observed, there will be no more disturbing conflicts in the world." The Swiss "Berner Tagblatt" said on June 30th that these principles "reasonably take into account the interests of both sides and guarantee peaceful coexistence free from fear."

    At the same time, many European newspapers and periodicals reported on the United States' conspiracy to undermine opportunities to strive for peace in the Far East and the world. On July 3rd, the British "Economist" weekly said, "The United States will continue to deny the possibility of peaceful coexistence for the Pacific countries." The weekly said, "At the same time, the United States is determined to make the Indochina issue as difficult to resolve as possible."

    亚洲、欧洲各国和澳大利亚报纸评中印、中缅总理会谈
    认为对亚洲和平有重大的意义
    【新华社新德里八日电】周恩来总理和印度、缅甸总理的会谈继续受到缅甸和锡兰报纸的欢迎。
    新出版的“缅甸明星报”以“一个亚洲宪章”为题发表评论说，“它意味着亚洲人自己可以最好地处理亚洲的事务。”中印、中缅总理的联合声明“显示了中国和印度、缅甸之间完美的关系的开始”。
    “仰光日报”研究了通过谈判解决印度支那问题的可能性，它说：“亚洲国家将普遍欢迎在这个地区实现和平。”
    “锡兰观察家报”（晚报）欢迎中印、中缅总理的联合声明，并认为，中华人民共和国应“在全世界其他大国中取得它应有的地位”。
    【新华社雅加达七日电】印尼报纸继续评论周恩来总理访问印度的重大意义。
    “星期日传信报”最近说：周恩来总理的访问印度是东南亚历史上极为重要的事件。报纸说：亚洲国家之间应该按照中、印两国关于中国西藏地方和印度之间的通商和交通协定的榜样，缔结互不侵犯条约以反击帝国主义者的战争妄想。这家报纸说，这种根据五个指导原则缔结的协定将挫败帝国主义者的侵略阴谋。
    “印尼新闻”的社论说：“这两位亚洲总理举行的会谈向全世界表明东方国家在和平解决国际争端方面的很明显的诚意与和平意图。这种谅解对于锡兰、印尼等其他亚洲国家是有非常重大的意义的。”
    “独立报”说，周恩来和尼赫鲁的会谈和以前任何一次由西方国家来讨论亚洲命运的会议都不同。报纸把这次会谈和邱吉尔与艾森豪威尔的华盛顿会谈加以比较，并指出中国印度两位总理的会谈是非常友好的。
      “独立报”指出，美国现在的处境很狼狈。它仍然拒不承认中华人民共和国。但是事实已经证明中华人民共和国在国际事务中正在发挥重要的作用。这一点不仅是在朝鲜战争中得到了证明，也在日内瓦会议上得到证明。
    印尼“人民日报”在五日的评论中说，德里会谈有力地说明了和平民主阵营力量日益强大，亚洲人民在保卫亚洲和平和安全的工作中日益团结。
    “人民日报”说，周恩来和尼赫鲁的会谈对于保障亚洲和平有极为重大的意义。所讨论的问题是亚洲国家自己的问题。这些问题就是如何保障亚洲和平和安全的问题，如何保障亚洲各国人民的民族独立以及如何反对对亚洲国家内部事务的干涉的问题。
      “人民日报”最后谈到华盛顿会谈，指出华盛顿会谈与亚洲人民对和平的愿望没有共同之处。报纸说：“他们在会谈后发表的公报并不能掩饰侵略意图和美国越来越孤立、帝国主义阵营越来越削弱的事实”。
   【新华社七日讯】澳大利亚“卫报”一日发表社论说：“中印两国总理会谈呈现着友好的气氛，这是两个一共有九亿六千万人口的大国进入和平合作的新阶段的先声。”
    社论强调说：若没有数以亿计的亚洲人民参加，一切有关亚洲和太平洋的重大问题就不可能解决。社论接着评论美国对中华人民共和国的态度说：在最近约五年来，美国政府的行为显得很像鸵鸟，“这只华盛顿鸵鸟满以为把自己的头插进沙里就可以认为伟大的中华人民共和国不存在”。
    【新华社七日讯】澳大利亚“论坛报”认为，任何真正谋求亚洲和平的国家都不能忽视中华人民共和国。“论坛报”最近在社论中说：“任何谋求亚洲和太平洋的和平的国家，它的政策中第一不可缺的就是和中国建立正常的外交关系。”
    社论指出，日内瓦会议的经验证明，关系到和平与战争的重大问题的谈判，中国是必须出席的。
    社论指责美国力图漠视中华人民共和国的政策，并指出：美国已经因为采取这一愚蠢的行径而更加孤立。
    【新华社八日讯】据印度新闻处消息：中非怯尼亚首都内罗毕的印度周刊“侨民时代”三日说，拥有九亿六千万人口的中印两国总理的会谈是历史上的重大事件。报纸说，“他们的声音和目的是一致的：他们将促进世界和平。”
    【新华社日内瓦八日电】英国和欧洲大陆的许多报纸和周刊在过去一星期中，从各种角度继续热烈地评论周恩来总理到印度和缅甸的访问。报纸认为周恩来总理的访问是中国、印度和缅甸人民间的友谊日益增长的表示。各报都强调指出周恩来总理在印度和缅甸所受到的热烈欢迎。
    英国“经济学家”周刊三日说，这是“历史性的会晤”。西德的“纽伦堡新闻”六月二十九日写道，中印两国总理联合声明说明，“这两位政治家举行会谈的目的是促进印度支那战争的和平解决。”瑞士“伯尔尼日报”六月三十日的消息说，“尼赫鲁总理和周恩来总理的会谈是迄今为止的最强烈的表示，它表明西方对亚洲的统治已将近结束了。”
    各报还以显著地位刊载了中印、中缅总理联合声明中规定的关于中印、中缅间的关系的五项指导原则，并且表示赞同。波恩报纸“一般新闻”六月二十九日的评论说：“这向全世界表明，尽管社会和政治制度有所不同，各种社会的和平共处还是可能的。假如这些原则都得到遵守，世界就再不会有令人不安的冲突了。”瑞士“伯尔尼日报”六月三十日说，这些原则“合理地照顾到双方的利益，并保证免于恐惧的和平共处”。
    同时，许多欧洲的报刊报道了美国破坏争取远东与世界和平的机会的阴谋。七月三日，英国“经济学家”周刊说，“美国将继续否认太平洋各国有和平共处的可能。”周刊说，“同时，美国决定尽可能使印度支那问题难于解决。”
