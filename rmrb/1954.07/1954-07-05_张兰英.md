    Zhang Lanying
    Bai Yuan
    I knew her name shortly after I arrived at the Fozi Ridge. One day, I was walking past the "Culture Corridor" at the Fozi Ridge Reservoir construction site. On that "Culture Corridor" built of bamboo and wood, there were many pictures of the reservoir's builders. Among those pictures, the first one was of Zhang Lanying. This picture was particularly easy to attract people's attention, which was very natural, because there were not many women participating in the reservoir construction project, and it was also ranked first among the pictures of many reservoir builders. The picture showed a capable woman, not tall, carrying a thick and long piece of wood on her low shoulders, running on the wind-swept and sun-scorched reservoir construction site. Looking out from that vast construction site, the beautiful and magnificent arched dam of the reservoir stood far behind her.
    In April, Fozi Ridge is in the blooming spring. Azaleas and wisteria flowers are in full bloom all over the mountains. Clusters of flowers are scattered with the rich fragrance of orchid flowers. The winding Pi River (a tributary of the Huai River) flows through the mountain gorge of Fozi Ridge. The beautiful Fozi Ridge Reservoir is built in this flower-filled, fragrant place. At this time, the construction of the Fozi Ridge Reservoir was nearing completion. One day, I walked from the west bank of the Pi River to the east bank through a wooden bridge at the reservoir construction site. The arched dam of the reservoir, formed by a series of huge arched buildings, stretched from the flower-filled west bank of the Pi River to the east bank. From a distance, it was easy to think of it as a string of huge petals. The Pi River water, blocked by the arched dam, sprayed out from a row of bucket-shaped spillway gates under the dam, and the splashing water showed rainbows under the sun's transmission. According to the pre-arranged location, I walked to a very high cliff on the east bank of the Pi River. Here, is the place where the arched dam of the reservoir and the east bank connect. Facing the arched dam, there is a house built of bamboo and wood on the cliff, with a sign "Equipment Storage Room of the Fifth Detachment" hanging next to the door. At this time, Zhang Lanying had not been transferred from the transportation team to the fifth detachment of the reservoir engineering team as an equipment keeper for long. I asked a worker who was bending over and counting a pile of screws at the door:
    "Is Zhang Lanying inside?"
    Hearing someone looking for Zhang Lanying, the worker stood up while patting the dust and rust on his hands, showing a solemn and kind expression, and for some reason suddenly said so much to me:
    "Zhang Lanying just went out. She hasn't been transferred here for long! The leadership transferred her here to take care of her health. She carries wood, moves cement, and pulls steel plates in the transportation team every day, and she always rushes to do the work. How can a woman stand it for a long time? She just arrived here not long ago. Because she is not familiar with many equipment, she is not asked to do anything else for the time being, but let her sit aside and take a look to familiarize herself. She was a bit tired in the transportation team, so she can rest during this time. But she can't sit still, and went to the dam with the grouting workers. Look, over there on an arch, that's her..."
    I looked in the direction pointed by the worker. Along the continuously extending arched dam, many workers were climbing on the staggered scaffolding. The sound of pouring concrete, the sound of heavy wood and steel colliding, and various hammering sounds gathered together, emitting a mixed roar. I tried my best to search among the workers who were building the arched dam, looking back at the worker standing beside me several times, trying to figure out the place he pointed out to me. Finally, I saw a person next to a dam arch in the distance. Because of the distance, her body became very small. She was climbing from one square of the scaffolding to another among a group of workers climbing on the scaffolding, and it seemed that she was holding something in her hand, but I couldn't see it clearly. Only her long hair fluttering in the wind distinguished her from the many workers. That was Zhang Lanying. Looking down through the place where they were, under the arched dam that had been built to more than one hundred meters high, the beautiful Pi River flowed quietly, like a colorful brocade that I don't know when it floated down from the air.
      "What is she doing climbing to such a high place?" I asked.
      "Helping people to hand ropes, take tools, and see if there are any gaps in the formwork of the grouting, and help them fix it. There's nothing to do, she'll be back in a while," the worker standing next to me said, and bent down to pack up the pile of screws again.
    However, I waited there for a long time, but I still didn't see her come back.
    The next day, I went there to look for her again. She was wearing a blue cloth uniform, with a tanned face, smiling brightly as she walked out of the equipment storage room and led me to sit down in a small room separated inside. She told me about her life experiences:
    —Speaking of which, you may have been there too, our hometown is on the edge of Hongze Lake in the lower reaches of the Huai River, under the jurisdiction of Sihong County. You know, those who were born in poor families in Sihong County and grew up on the edge of Hongze Lake, which one has not experienced several storms? When I was a child, I followed my parents to work for the landlord. When I was just twenty-one years old, Wang Laoliu, the village chief, wanted to rob me to his home. That day was the evening of the sixteenth day of the third lunar month. I was sleeping in the house when a burst of shouting woke me up. I leaned on the window and saw Wang Laoliu leading several people with guns guarding the door of my house under the moonlight. My mother stopped him in the front room. I climbed over the wall from the back door and ran out. It was already midnight, and I wondered, where should I run to? Later, I stopped in front of a house and knocked on the door, without caring about anything. A man opened the door for me with a coat on. When he saw me, he asked:
    "What's the matter?"
    "Wang Laoliu is here to rob people!" I said, "Good uncle, let me in to hide!"
    He grabbed me and pulled me into the house, closed the door, and locked me in a cabinet in his house. Wang Laoliu tied my father and mother with ropes, and led his men to search house by house. When they couldn't find me, they locked up my father and beat him all night. When it was almost dawn, the man who hid me wrote me a letter and asked me to take the letter and walk twelve miles from our Houyao Street to Qianyao Street to find the district chief there. At that time, I didn't know that the man who hid me was the village chief sent by the Communist Party to our place. It was 1945 at that time, and our place was a tug-of-war zone (the boundary between the liberated area and the enemy-occupied area). Houyao Street was occupied by the enemy, and Qianyao Street was the base of our New Fourth Army. I ran to Qianyao Street, and it was just dawn. When I saw the district chief, I really wanted to cry in front of him. But I didn't cry. I told them how I ran out alone. They said a lot to comfort me, telling me not to worry about my family, and that they could help me with any difficulties. Later, the district chief asked me what I planned to do after I came out, and said that they could help me.
    I still regret it now. If I had joined their work there at that time, I wouldn't have made such slow progress until now. At that time, I had an aunt's family in the liberated area. I thought, let's go to my aunt's house to live first. Who knew that I helped them with production and lived there until the ninth lunar month. Many places around Hongze Lake were liberated. I returned to Houyao Street from my aunt's house. In the second year of the liberation of my hometown, I got engaged to Li Qingrong, and a year later, we got married in December. Although it was liberated, life was still very difficult. We had a child in the second year of our marriage. Besides farming in the fields, Li Qingrong and I cut grass, caught fish, and pulled lotus roots in Hongze Lake to make a living. This continued until 1949. In June, a big flood came down from the Huai River. The water in Hongze Lake rose a lot, the grass could not be cut, the lotus roots could not be pulled, and the fish all ran away with the flood.
    Later, I persuaded Li Qingrong to join the People's Liberation Army. Li Qingrong said:
      "What will you do alone if I leave?"
    I said: "You don't have to worry about me. If you leave, work hard outside, and I will work hard in production at home. No matter how far apart we are, if we walk on the same path, one day our lives will be better."
    But when I thought about parting, I always felt sad. Li Qingrong went from home to Hefei. On the morning of his departure, because I felt very sad, I watched him leave and went back to my room to sleep with the child.
    Li Qingrong sent a letter from Hefei not long after he left, saying that he had joined the army in Hefei, and asked me to work hard in production at home. I planted some crops at home and relied on government relief for some, and this continued for a year. In June 1950, the big flood came again. The non-stop rain fell for forty days. Hongze Lake was rolling with waves more than one person high, roaring dimly. The land and crops were all submerged at once.
    I packed up my belongings and took my three-year-old child to Hefei to find Li Qingrong. I found their troops in Hefei, and stayed in the family dormitory of the troops for two weeks. The troops wrote a letter of introduction to a moving station for me to work, pulling a flatbed cart with others at the moving station.
    Then, the Huai River management project began. And I heard that the Fozi Ridge Reservoir would start construction soon, and many workers went from Hefei. Coincidentally, the eight of us who pulled a flatbed cart together were all driven out of Sihong by the flood. When we heard about the Huai River management, everyone wanted to go. After Li Qingrong and I discussed it, we wrote a letter to his old father to come to Hefei to take the child back home. When the Fozi Ridge Reservoir started construction, I and the flatbed cart group, with a letter of introduction from the moving station, pulled a cart of sheet piles from Hefei to the reservoir construction site for the reservoir. When I arrived at the reservoir construction site and contacted the engineering headquarters, I joined the transportation team on the construction site the next day. There were more than thirty people working with us, besides me, there were five women. Not long after I arrived at the reservoir construction site, Li Qingrong wrote a letter saying that he had also joined the Chinese People's Volunteers to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, and asked me to write to him after he arrived in Korea. At that time, we were pulling cement, sheet piles, and moving wood on the construction site every day, and often had to wade in many places when crossing the river. Sometimes after working for a day, we returned to the dormitory from the construction site in wet clothes, and those women sat together sighing. Some of them had just left home to come here, and at first they heard that the reservoir project was great, and thought it would be very pleasant to come here. Later, they felt that the work here was hard, and they missed their homes. At night, they lay in bed thinking about their husbands and children, and they cried as they thought about it. I often used the great truth of women's liberation to persuade them. Actually, I missed them too! At that time, the child had just been sent home not long ago, and I had walked on the same path with Li Qingrong, and then separated again. However, everyone has their own ideas. If it weren't for the future to be able to live together better and live a more beautiful life, why would I think about it? Later, not long after, all five of them went home. I was the only one left with the male workers. I treated them like my own brothers. When I was free, I often took their dirty clothes to the river to wash them, and if their clothes and shoes were torn, I would mend them, also in order to not be free and think about those disturbing things.
    However, at that time, there was a person named Chen Shirong who worked with us, who used to be an accountant in a kiln factory in Hefei. I don't know why he ran here, as if I was an eyesore to him, and he tried every means to make me suffer every day. After the five women who worked with us left, one day, we transported a large pile of wood from the foot of a mountain to the Pi River bank. The wood was piled up like a small mountain. Chen Shirong said:
      "Zhang Lanying, let's see if you can carry this pile of wood with us. If you can't, you have to go home."
    I said: "If you can carry it, I can carry it too."
    On the first day, I and a few people were assigned to help others put the wood on their shoulders for them to carry. The next day, it was Chen Shirong's turn to put the wood on our shoulders for us to carry. Chen Shirong picked the big ones to put on my shoulders, some of them were almost a foot thick and two feet long. I carried them to the river bank, but I couldn't climb up the pile. Our group leader Wang Guishan helped me pile the wood on the pile, and asked me why I was carrying such big ones. I said that Chen Shirong deliberately picked the big ones for me to carry. Later, Chen Shirong said that everyone should carry in a line, and no matter who it was, if it was a big one, they had to carry it. We carried it like this for half a month, until all that big pile of wood was carried away, and I didn't carry one less than them.
    Another time, we used small flatbed carts to pull sleepers from a place more than ten miles away to the light railway line upstream of the Pi River. The sleepers were about to be pulled away, and only the last trip was left. When I went to load the last trip, because I walked slowly and was at the back, Chen Shirong's cart was right in front of me. We hadn't arrived yet, and some carts had already been loaded and were coming back from the opposite side. Chen Shirong saw that people were already coming back, so he hurriedly ran forward pulling the cart. Originally, there were only two carts of sleepers left. When I pulled the cart and arrived, Chen Shirong had already loaded the cart, but the cart was not full, so he went back. I shouted at him from behind, but he ignored me, so I had to pile all the last remaining sleepers on my own cart. Before I walked far, I had to wade across a river. When the cart reached the center of the river, I couldn't pull it anymore. Several PLA soldiers who participated in the construction of the reservoir on the shore saw me wading there alone, unable to pull it, so they ran into the river to help me push and pull. When the cart was pulled to the shore, the straw sandals I was wearing on my feet broke the rope in the water, and were also washed away by the water in the river. I pulled the cart barefoot and went to chase the cart that had already gone far ahead. After walking not far, a soldier caught up from behind, saw that I was not wearing shoes, and took off the pair of cloth shoes he was wearing on his feet and let me put them on. I carried those shoes in my hand, and only put them on when I caught up with them.
    At this time, Li Qingrong had already sent a letter from Korea, saying that they lived in caves and fought with the American devils every day. Although everything was very difficult, in order to defend peace and defend the motherland, they were not afraid of any difficulties, and asked me to wholeheartedly build the motherland and not be afraid of any difficulties. After receiving his letter, I wrote back to him. I said, there are difficulties everywhere, and I will definitely do as he said, and never bow to difficulties, and told him not to worry about me. You think, could I tell him a lie? Once, it was in November, it was snowing, and a batch of wooden boards transported by bamboo rafts were parked on the river, and we were asked to quickly move them to the woodworking factory. That morning, everyone walked to the river bank and didn't dare to go into the water, just shouting: "Who goes down first!" Some people said: "Zhang Lanying dares to go down, and we dare to go down too." I rolled up my trouser legs, waded through the cold river water, picked up a wooden board from the bamboo raft and walked back. They also went into the water after arguing. It only took half a day, and we moved all those wooden boards. Soon after, one day, the transportation team assigned us 70,000 catties of cement, and we needed to pull it from the original cement warehouse to a mixing machine warehouse on the same day, because the reservoir's concrete project was progressing rapidly at that time, and if we didn't pull the cement on the same day, it wouldn't be enough for the mixing machine to use. We thought, how can we pull so much cement in one day? We put a few people at the original cement warehouse to move the cement from the warehouse to the cart, and put a few people at the mixing machine warehouse to move the cement into the warehouse. Just move it, just pull it. This is much easier and faster to pull. But from early in the morning until 5 pm, there were still forty bags left to be pulled. Some people, seeing that it was almost time to get off work, saw that the cement couldn't be pulled away, and put the cement in front of the mixing machine warehouse and sat down by the roadside waiting to get off work. At that time, I was moving cement here at the mixing machine warehouse. Group leader Wang Guishan ran over to me and said:
      "Zhang Lanying, look, the cement can't be pulled away, what should we do?"
    I said: "It's okay, let me move the cement on the cart, let me pull it."
    After I moved the cement on the last cart, Wang Guishan and I pulled a cart each. On the way, Wang Guishan quietly said to me from behind:
    "Zhang Lanying, look, everyone is following."
    When we counted at the cement warehouse, a total of ten carts followed us, each cart could pull six bags of cement, and the cement assigned to us was not enough to pull, so we took another twenty bags from the warehouse.
    —Did Li Qingrong send any more letters from Korea later? I asked.
    —Yes, I received a letter from him almost every ten days. After the Korean War ended, he was transferred to the mechanical company. Recently, I received four letters in less than a month.
    —What did the letters he sent recently say?
    —Saying that they are still vigilantly guarding the enemy while they are learning about machines, they are so happy, and sent me a photo, and asked me in several letters to keep it safe and not lose the photo.
    —What kind of machine is he learning?
    —I can't say. He didn't say in the letter. Maybe it's their military secret!
    —Where is the photo he sent? Let me see his photo.
    Zhang Lanying reached out and took out a pink envelope from her close-fitting clothes pocket, and said to me while handing it to me:
    —Here it is, take a look.
    On the front of the envelope was written the address of the Fozi Ridge Reservoir construction site and the name of the recipient, but on the back of the envelope was written: "Butterfly, fly away, come back soon!" And the date of sending was carefully noted in the middle. When I opened the envelope and took out the photo, Li Qingrong sent Zhang Lanying not a photo of himself, but a Stalin-style large tractor. So I had to turn the topic around and say to Zhang Lanying:
    —He wrote on the envelope that he wants you to write back to him quickly. Do you write back to him quickly every time you receive his letter?
    —Which time didn't I write back to him quickly? It's just that sometimes I'm too busy with work, and I can't put my work down just to write back to him.
    Seeing that the sun was about to set, we stopped talking. Because Zhang Lanying also had to go down the mountain back to their fifth detachment's dormitory, we walked out of that equipment storage room together. The azaleas on the hillside reflected the colorful clouds in the sky, as if they were blooming more brightly and brilliantly. Walking with Zhang Lanying, I thought of Li Qingrong in the Korean Volunteer Army again. I seemed to see him right in front of my eyes. I saw him holding a gun, learning to drive a tractor in the Korean fields, just like in the fields of his hometown. I saw how he excitedly took a photo of a Stalin-style tractor to express his endless love to his lover for his best wishes. I said:
    —Zhang Lanying, when can I take a photo for you and send it to Li Qingrong?
    —Yes, take a photo of the reservoir's arched dam too.
    —Otherwise, just take a photo of the arched dam and send it to him. Look at the photo he sent you, isn't it just a tractor?
    Zhang Lanying didn't answer me, just smiled. We walked down the flower-filled hillside together.

专栏：

    张兰英
    白原
    我知道她的名字，还是在我刚到佛子岭不久的时候。有一天，我从佛子岭水库工地上的“文化走廊”前面走过。在那一道用竹木搭成的“文化走廊”上，张挂着许多水库的建设者们的画片。在那许多画片里面，第一幅画的就是张兰英。这一幅画片特别容易引起人们的注意，那是很自然的，因为参加水库建筑工程的妇女并不多，而且在那许多水库建设者们的画片里面，又是排列在第一个。那幅画片上画的是一个精明强干的妇女，个子不高，低低的肩膀上扛着一根又粗又长的木头，在风吹日晒的水库建筑工地上奔跑着，从那一片浩大的建筑工地望过去，美丽的、雄伟的水库的连拱坝远远地耸立在她的后面。
    四月，在佛子岭，正是花朵盛开的春天。满山的杜鹃花、紫藤花都在开放。一簇簇花丛里，散布出兰草花的浓郁的芳香。弯弯的淠河（淮河的一条支流）从佛子岭的山峡里流过。美丽的佛子岭水库，就建筑在这一个花团锦簇，芳香漫溢的地方。这时候，佛子岭水库的建筑工程快要完成了。有一天，我在水库的建筑工地上，从淠河西岸通过一道木板桥走到东岸上。一个个巨大的拱形建筑连成的水库的连拱坝，从开满花朵的淠河西岸一直连到东岸，远远看去，很容易使人联想到一串巨大的花瓣。被连拱坝挡住的淠河的流水，从坝下一排斗形的泄水闸门里喷出来，飞溅的水花在太阳的透射下现出了一道道彩虹。按照预先打听到的地点，我走到淠河东岸的一个很高的山崖上。这里，正是水库的连拱坝和东岸衔接的地方。对着连拱坝，在山崖上面有一所用竹木搭成的房子，门旁挂着一块“第五区队器材保管室”的牌子。这时候，张兰英从工地上的运输大队调到水库工程队第五区队来当器材保管员还不久。我问一个正在门口弯着腰清点一堆螺丝的工人：
    “张兰英在不在里面？”
    听见有人找张兰英，那个工人一边立起来，一边拍着手上的灰尘和铁锈，现出一副又庄重又亲切的神气，不知道为什么一下子絮絮地对我说了这么许多：
    “张兰英刚出去。她调到这里来还没有多久呢！上级为了照顾她的身体，才把她调到这里来。在运输大队天天扛木头，搬水泥，拉钢板，工作又老是抢着干，日子长了，一个妇女，哪受得了？现在她刚到这里才不久，因为对许多器材都还不熟悉，先不叫她干别的，让她坐在旁边看看，熟悉熟悉。在运输大队的时候，有些劳累，趁这时候可以休息休息。可是她坐不住，又和那些灌浆工人一起爬到坝上去了。你看，在那边一个坝拱上，那就是她，……。”
    我顺着那个工人所指的方向望过去，沿着一直往前伸延的连拱坝，许多工人们爬在那些参差的建筑架上。倾倒混凝土的哗啦啦的声音，沉重的木头、钢铁的碰击的声音，以及各种捶击的声音汇集起来了，发出了一阵阵混杂的巨响。我竭力用眼睛在那些正在建筑连拱坝的工人们中间找寻，好几次回过头来看看站在我身旁的那个工人，揣摩他给我所指的地方。最后，我看见在很远的一个坝拱旁边有一个人，因为距离远，身子变得很小，正在一群爬在建筑架上的工人中间从一个建筑架的方格子爬到另一个方格子上，手上好像还拿着个什么东西，可是看不清，只有那一头被风飘起的长发把她从那许多工人中间区别出来，那就是张兰英。通过他们所在的地方往下看，在已经建筑到一百多公尺高的连拱坝下面，美丽的淠河静静地流着，好像一幅不知什么时候从空中飘下去的彩色缤纷的锦缎。
      “她爬到那么高的地方去干什么呢？”我问。
      “帮人家递递绳子呀，拿拿工具呀，看看灌浆的模壳子板有什么缝缝眼眼，就替人家弄弄，没有什么事，一会就回来了。”站在我旁边的那个工人说着，又弯下腰去收拾那一堆螺丝去了。
    可是，我一直在那里等了好一会，还是没有见她回来。
    过了一天，我又到那里去找她。她穿一身蓝布制服，晒得黑黑的脸，开朗地笑着从那间器材保管室里走出来，把我引到里面一间隔开的小房子里坐下来。她就对我述说她所经历过的生活：
    ——说起来，想你说不定也到过，我们的家乡，就在淮河下游的洪泽湖边上，属泗洪县管。你知道，在我们泗洪县的穷人家里出生，在洪泽湖边长大的人，那一个没有经过好几次风浪？小时候，我跟着父母亲给地主种地。等我刚好长到二十一岁，乡里的保长王老六就要来把我抢到他的家里去。那一天正是阴历三月十六晚上，我正在屋里睡着，一阵吆喝的声音把我惊醒过来，伏在窗前从月亮下看见王老六带着好几个人，拿着枪把着我家门口。母亲在前屋把他拦住。我就从后门爬上墙头跑出来。那时已经半夜，我想，该跑到哪里去？赶后，我在一家人家的门口停下来，顾不得许多，就拍门。一个男人披着件衣裳给我开门，一见我，就问：
    “出了什么事？”
    “王老六来我家抢人呢！”我说：“好叔伯大爷，让我进去躲一躲！”
    他一把拉着我进了屋，把门关上，就把我锁在他家的一个柜子里面。王老六用绳子拴着我父亲和母亲，带着他们的人挨家找，找不到，又把我父亲关起来打了一夜。天快亮的时候，把我藏起来的那家的男人给我写了封信，让我带着信从我们后窑街走十二里路到前窑街去找那里的区长。那时候，我还不知道把我藏起来的那家的男人就是共产党派到我们那里去的村长。那时候正是一九四五年，我们那地方是块拉锯地（解放区和敌占区交界的地方），后窑街被敌人占着，前窑街就是我们新四军的根据地。我跑到前窑街，天刚亮。见到了区长，我真想在他面前哭一场。可是，我没有哭。我把我一个人怎样跑出来的经过对他们说了。他们说了好些话来宽我的心，叫我不用顾虑家，有什么困难，他们可以替我想办法。赶后，区长又问我出来以后打算怎么办，说他们可以帮我的忙。
    我现在想起来还后悔，要是那时候我就在那里参加他们的工作，到现在也不会进步这么慢。那时候我有个姑母家在解放区。我想，先到姑母家里住下再说吧。谁知到了姑母家里，帮他们搞搞生产，一住住到阴历九月，洪泽湖周围许多地方都解放了。我从姑母家回到了后窑街。家乡解放的第二年，我和李庆荣订了婚，又过了一年，我们就在腊月里结了婚。虽然解放了，可是生活还是很困难。结婚第二年我们就有了个孩子。我和李庆荣除了在地里做做庄稼活，就在洪泽湖里砍草，捉鱼，拔藕来维持生活。这样一直过到一九四九年。六月里，从淮河上下来了大水。洪泽湖里的水长得很大，草不能砍，藕不能拔，鱼也都跟着大水跑了。
    后来，我就劝李庆荣出去参加解放军。李庆荣说：
      “我走了，你一个人怎么办？”
    我说：“你不用顾虑我。你走了，在外面好好干，我在家里好好生产，不管相隔有多远，两个人朝着一条道上走，总有一天，我们的日子会过得更好。”
    可是想到要分开的时候，心里总是要难过，李庆荣从家里到合肥去，临走那早上，因为心里很难过，看着他走了以后，我就带着孩子回房里睡觉去了。
    李庆荣走了没有多久，就从合肥寄了信来，说他在合肥参加了部队，叫我在家好好生产。我在家里种些庄稼，靠政府救济一些，这样过了一年。一九五○年六月里，大水又来了。不停的雨整整下了四十天。洪泽湖翻卷着一人多高的浪头，吼得昏天黑地。地和庄稼一下全被淹光了。
    我把家里的东西收拾了一下，就带着三岁大的孩子到合肥去找李庆荣。在合肥找到了他们的部队，在部队的家属宿舍里住了两个星期，由部队上写了封信介绍我到一个搬运站去工作，在搬运站和人家一起拉板车。
    接着，治淮工程开始了。而且听说，不久，佛子岭水库就要开工，从合肥去的工人很多。刚好，我们一起拉一挂板车的八个人都是从泗洪被大水赶出来的，一听说治淮，谁也要去。我和李庆荣商量好了以后，写信叫他老爹爹到合肥来把孩子带回了家。等到佛子岭水库一开工，我就和拉板车的一起，由搬运站写了封介绍信，从合肥替水库拉了一车钢板桩到水库工地上来。到了水库工地和工程指挥部一接头，第二天就参加了工地上的运输大队。和我们一起工作的一共三十几个人，除了我，还有五个妇女。我到了水库工地没有多久，李庆荣来信说他也参加了抗美援朝志愿军，叫我等他到朝鲜以后来了信，再写信给他。那时候，我们在工地上天天拉水泥，拉钢板桩，搬运木头，常常在过河的时候，有许多地方还得趟水。有时候干了一天，从工地上穿着一身湿衣裳回到宿舍里，那几个妇女就坐在一起唉声叹气。有的刚离开家到这里来，开始听说水库工程很伟大，以为到这里来很惬意，赶后觉得在这里工作苦，就想家，晚上一个人躺在床上想丈夫，想孩子，想着想着就哭起来。我常常拿妇女翻身的大道理来劝她们。其实，我也想哩！那时候，孩子刚送回家没有多久，和李庆荣走到了一道，又分开。只是，各人有各人的想法。如果不是为了将来能够在一起过得更好，日子过得更美，又为什么要想呢？后来没有多久，她们五个人都回家去了。剩下我一个人和男工们在一起。我待他们就像自己的亲兄弟，空下来的时候，常常替他们把穿脏的衣服拿到河边去洗，衣服、鞋子破了，就替他们补补缝缝，也为了不叫自己空下来一个人去想那些心烦意乱的事情。
    可是，那时候和我们一起工作的，有一个人叫陈世荣，原来在合肥一个窑厂里当会计，不知怎么跑到这里来，好像我在这里碍了他的眼，天天想方设法找苦头给我吃。那五个原先和我们一起工作的妇女走了以后，有一天，我们从一个山下搬运一大堆木头到淠河岸上，木头堆得像一座小山一样，陈世荣就说：
      “张兰英，看你能不能和我们一起把这一堆木头扛完，不行的话，就得回家去了。”
    我说：“你们能扛完我也能扛完。”
    第一天，我和几个人被分出来帮人家把木头架到肩上，让他们扛。第二天轮到陈世荣和其他几个人给我们架，让我们来扛。陈世荣就拣大的架给我扛，有的差不多有一尺那么粗，两丈来长。我扛到河边上，爬不上堆。我们的组长王贵山替我把木头堆到堆上，问我为什么扛那么大的。我说陈世荣故意拣大的给我扛。后来，陈世荣就说，大家排着队扛，不管是谁，轮到大的就得扛大的。这样扛了半个月，一直到把那一大堆木头都扛完了，我也没有比他们少扛一根。
    还有一回，我们用小板车从十多里路远的地方拉道木到淠河上游的轻便铁道线上。道木就要拉完，剩下最后一趟了。在去装最后一趟车的时候，因为我走得慢，走在最后面，刚好陈世荣的一辆车就挨在我的前面。我们还没有走到，已经有好些车子装了车，从我们对面往回走了。陈世荣看见人家已经在往回走，就拉着车子赶忙往前跑。本来最后就剩下两车子道木。等我拉着车子走到的时候，陈世荣已经装了车，可是车子没有装满，就往回走。我在后面喊他他也不管，只好把最后剩下的道木通通堆到自己车上。走不远，就要趟水过一道河。车子走到河中心，我就拉不动了。岸上几个参加建筑水库的解放军战士看见我一个人趟着水在那里拉，拉不动，就跑到河里来帮我推，帮我拉。车子拉到岸上，我脚上穿的一双草鞋在水里断了绳子，也在河里被水冲走了。我赤着脚拉上车就去撵前面已经走远了的车子。走了没有多远，一个战士从后面赶上来，看见我没有穿鞋子，就把他脚上的一双布鞋脱下来让我穿上。我提着那双鞋子，一直到撵上他们的时候才把它穿上。
    这时候，李庆荣已经从朝鲜来了信，说他们住在山洞里，天天和美国鬼子打仗，虽然一切都很艰难，但是为了保卫和平，保卫祖国，他们什么艰难也不怕，叫我一心一意建设祖国，碰到什么困难也不要害怕。我接到他的信以后就写信给他。我说，困难，哪里都有，我一定照他对我说的一样，绝不向困难低头，叫他不要挂念我。你想，我还能对他说一句假话？有一回，正是十一月里，天下着雪，有一批由竹排运来的木板停泊在河面上，要我们赶快搬到木工厂去。那天早上，大家走到河边上，都不敢下水，只是一个劲嚷着：“谁先下！”有的人就说：“张兰英敢下，我们也敢下。”我把裤腿卷起来，趟过冰冷的河水，从竹排上扛起一块木板就往回走。他们吵吵嚷嚷也都下了水。只花了半天功夫，我们就把那一批木板搬完了。接着没有多久，有一天，运输大队分配给我们七万斤水泥，而且需要当天就由原来放水泥的仓库用小板车拉到一座拌合机的仓库去，因为那时候水库的混凝土工程正在飞快地进行着，当天不把水泥拉完就不够拌合机用。我们想，怎么才能够一天就把这许多水泥拉完？我们在原来的水泥仓库那边放上几个人，把水泥从仓库里搬到车上，在拌合机仓库这边放上几个人，把水泥搬到仓库里去，搬的光管搬，拉的光管拉。这样省劲得多，拉得也快。可是从大清早一直拉到下午五点钟，还剩四十包没有拉完。有的人看着就要下班，看看水泥已经拉不完，把水泥拉到拌合机仓库门前，就撂下车子在路旁坐下来等着下班。那时候，我正在拌合机仓库这边搬水泥。组长王贵山跑来对我说：
      “张兰英，你看水泥拉不完了，怎办？”
    我说：“不要紧，等我把车上的水泥搬完，让我去拉。”
    我把最后一挂车上的水泥搬完，就和王贵山一人拉着一挂车子走了。走到半路上，王贵山悄悄地在后面对我说：
    “张兰英，你看，大家都跟着来了。”
    到了水泥仓库那边一数，陆陆续续跟着我们一共来了十挂车子，一挂车能拉六包水泥，这一下分给我们的水泥反而不够拉了，又从仓库里领了二十包。
    ——后来李庆荣还有没有从朝鲜寄过信来？我问。
    ——寄过。差不多隔十天就接他一封信。朝鲜停战以后，他调到机械连去了。最近不到一个月就来了四封信。
    ——最近寄来的信说的什么呢？
    ——说他们现在一边还是不放松地警惕着敌人，一边正在学机器，高兴得不行，给我寄了一张照片来，好几封信叫我替他好好保存着，不要把照片搞丢了。
    ——他是在学的什么机器？
    ——我可说不上来。他信上也没有说。也许是他们的军事秘密呢！
    ——他寄来的照片在哪里？让我看看他的照片。
    张兰英伸手从她的贴身衣服的口袋里拿出一个粉红信封来，一边把它递给我，一边对我说：
    ——在这里，你看吧。
    在信封的正面写着佛子岭水库建筑工地的地址和收信人的名字，而在信封的背面却写着：“蝴蝶飞去，快回来！”而且还仔细地在当中注上了发信的日期。等我打开信封，把照片拿出来一看，李庆荣给张兰英寄来的却不是他自己的照片，而是一架斯大林式的大型拖拉机。于是我只好掉转话头来对张兰英说：
    ——他在信封上写着，要你快点给他回信。你是不是每次接到他的信都很快就给他回信？
    ——哪一次不是很快就给他回信？只是有时候工作忙不过来，总不能因为给他回信，倒把工作搁下来。
    看看太阳快要落山，我们把谈话停止下来。因为张兰英也要下山回他们第五区队的宿舍去，我们一起从那间器材保管室里走出来。山坡上的杜鹃花映照着天上的彩霞，好像开得更加鲜红，更加灿烂。和张兰英在一起走着，我又想起了那个在朝鲜志愿军部队里的李庆荣。我好像看见他就在我的眼前。我看见他一边拿着枪，一边怎样在朝鲜的田野上、像在自己家乡的田野上一样在学着开拖拉机。我看见他为了自己的最好的愿望，怎样兴高采烈地把一张斯大林式的拖拉机照片拿来向自己的爱人表达那无尽止的爱情。我说：
    ——张兰英，什么时候我替你照张照片寄给李庆荣吧。
    ——对，把水库的连拱坝也照上。
    ——不然，就光照座连拱坝寄给他。你看他给你寄的照片，不也是光有架拖拉机？
    张兰英没有回答我，只管笑着。我们一起走下了那个开满花朵的山坡。
