Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, 11th: The delegations from Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos to the International Conference for Relaxation of Tensions in Stockholm stated in a joint report to the Liaison Committee of the Vietnam-Cambodia-Laos People's Alliance and to the people of the three countries that the people of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, as well as the French people and the people of the world, are eagerly hoping to end the Indochina War; only the American warmongers and their servants are obstructing a peaceful resolution to the Indochina issue.

The report, after pointing out the purpose and resolutions of the Stockholm Conference, continued by saying that the Indochina issue has been a hotly debated topic at the International Conference for Relaxation of Tensions. The three delegations from Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos declared their full support for the proposals put forward at the Geneva Conference by Pham Van Dong, Deputy Prime Minister and Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, and Chinese Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai.

The report said that we met with the French delegation, which included members from various political parties, such as Professor René Capitant, who had served as a French cabinet minister, André Denis, a member of the National Assembly and a former member of the Popular Republican Movement, Deschamps, a member of the National Assembly and a progressive, Jacques Madaol, a Catholic, and Pierre Lebrun, a member of the French government's Economic Commission and vice-chairman of the French Veterans Union.

The French delegation and the delegations from Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos decided to write a letter to the Geneva Conference, putting forward the following recommendations:

(1) To make comprehensive efforts to reach a ceasefire as soon as possible in the three countries of Indochina through an agreement between the opposing sides.

(2) To avoid all schemes and actions aimed at delaying and expanding the Indochina War, and deepening the threat of a new world war.

(3) To do their utmost to conclude a peace treaty between France and the three countries of Indochina on the basis of respecting the sovereignty, independence, and unity of the Indochinese countries, and respecting democratic rights and the right to choose their own political and social systems.

The report pointed out: The people of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, as well as the people of France, will never allow the American warmongers and their servants to fill their pockets with the blood of the people. The people of the world are now increasingly resolutely opposing American war instigators.

The report concluded by pointing out the belief of the people of the three countries in their long, arduous, but inevitably victorious struggle for peace, independence, unity, and democracy.

    越南高棉寮国参加缓和局势国际会议代表团
    支持越苏中对日内瓦会议的建议
    【新华社十二日讯】越南通讯社北越十一日讯：参加斯德哥尔摩缓和局势国际会议的越南、高棉和寮国的代表团在向越南—高棉—寮国人民联盟联络委员会和向三国人民发表的一份联合报告中说，越南、高棉和寮国的人民以及法国人民和全世界人民都切望结束印度支那战争；只有美国战争贩子和他们的仆从们是在阻挠和平解决印度支那问题。
    这篇报告在指出斯德哥尔摩会议的目的和决议后，接着说，在缓和局势国际会议上，印度支那问题一直是讨论得很热烈的问题。越南、高棉和寮国的三个代表团宣布，他们完全支持越南民主共和国副总理兼代理外交部长范文同、苏联外交部长莫洛托夫和中华人民共和国外交部长周恩来在日内瓦会议上提出的建议。
    报告说，我们遇见了法国代表团，这个代表团的成员包括各政党的人士，例如曾任过法国内阁部长的雷纳·加比唐教授、国民议会议员和人民共和党以前的党员安德烈·德尼、国民议会议员和进步人士德香布兰、天主教徒雅克·马道尔、法国政府的经济委员会委员和法兰西退伍军人联盟的副主席皮埃尔·勒布朗。
    法国代表团和越南、高棉、寮国的代表团决定写一封信给日内瓦会议，提出下列建议：
    （一）作全面的努力，以便通过敌对双方之间的协议在印度支那三个国家尽快地达成停火。
    （二）避免一切旨在拖延并扩大印度支那战争，以及加深新的世界大战的威胁的图谋和行动。
    （三）尽其全力使法国和印度支那的三国之间在尊重印度支那各国的主权、独立和统一，并尊重民主权利和选择其自己的政治与社会制度的权利的基础之上，缔结一项和平条约。
    这篇报告指出：越南、高棉和寮国的人民以及法国的人民决不允许美国战争贩子和他们的仆从们用人民的鲜血来饱他们的私囊。全世界的人民现在正日益坚决地反对美国的战争挑拨分子。
    这篇报告最后指出了三国人民为争取和平、独立、统一和民主而进行的长期的、艰苦的、然而是必胜的斗争的信念。
