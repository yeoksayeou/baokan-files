Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, 16th: At the request of the U.S. delegation, the delegation of the People's Republic of China held another meeting with the former at 10:00 a.m. on the 16th to discuss the issue of nationals of both countries residing in each other's territories.

The U.S. delegation was represented by Alfred Jenkins, a political affairs officer of the China Desk at the U.S. State Department. He submitted a revised list of some American nationals currently in China and American military personnel detained for violating Chinese airspace.

The Chinese delegation was represented by Pu Shan, a section chief of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China. He stated that the Chinese side would review the aforementioned list and reiterated the Chinese side's request that the U.S. side clarify the situation of Chinese nationals and students being prevented from returning to China from the United States.

In the talks on June 21, the Chinese side proposed, on the basis of mutual equality, that the United States could ask an envoy from a third country that has diplomatic relations with both parties to represent the interests of American nationals in China, as the United States had proposed through the British negotiating representative in Beijing in 1950; at the same time, China also requested that an envoy from a third country that has diplomatic relations with both parties represent the interests of Chinese nationals and students in the United States. The U.S. side has not yet responded to this.

    应美国代表团方面的要求
    我国续和美国谈判侨民问题
    【新华社日内瓦十六日电】中华人民共和国代表团方面应美国代表团方面的要求，在十六日上午十时就两国在对方境内的侨民的问题和后者进行了又一次接触。
    美国代表团出席人员为美国国务院中国司政治事务官艾尔弗雷德·詹金斯。他交来了一份经过修改的现在中国境内的部分美国侨民和因侵犯中国领空而被拘禁的美国军事人员的名单。
    中国代表团出席人员为中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部科长浦山。他表示中国方面对上项名单将予以审查，并再次要求美国方面澄清中国侨民和学生被阻留在美国不得返国的情况。
    中国方面在六月二十一日的会谈中曾经提出，在相互平等的基础上，美国可以请一个和双方有外交关系的第三国驻华使节代管美国在华侨民的利益，这是美国经过英国驻北京谈判代表在一九五零年提出的；同时，中国也请一个和双方有外交关系的第三国驻美使节代管中国在美国的侨民和留学生的利益。对此，美国方面尚未提出答复。
