Reader's Letters Excerpts:

Southwest Xinhua Bookstore Should Not Destroy Books

Reader Xiang Rong writes: The Southwest People's Publishing House (now renamed the Southwest Office of the People's Publishing House, hereinafter referred to as the Southwest Office), in order to promote the Marriage Law, printed a large number of "Illustrated Explanation of the Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China" in 1952. At that time, due to an overestimation of sales volume, the plan was too large, resulting in a serious oversupply. According to a recent incomplete survey by the Southwest General Branch of Xinhua Bookstore (hereinafter referred to as the Southwest General Branch), Xinhua Bookstores in the Southwest region (including local state-owned People's Bookstores) have a total backlog of more than 500,000 copies of the book, with the Southwest General Branch alone holding 160,000 copies.

During the printing of the book by the Southwest Office's printing factory, more than 162,000 copies were delivered late due to the "Three-Anti" movement. At that time, the Southwest General Branch treated this batch of books as consignment sales according to the contract. Recently, the Southwest Office and the Southwest General Branch, in order to settle accounts and end the consignment procedures for the book, decided through consultation that Xinhua Bookstore would handle the book by means of returning the goods; at the same time, in order to save postage during the return of the books, it was also decided that Xinhua Bookstores with large inventories in various places would tear off the covers according to the prescribed return limit and send them to the Southwest General Branch for unified return to the Southwest Office. Of course, the books with the covers torn off would have to be destroyed. The Southwest General Branch has issued a notice to its subordinate distribution units to implement the decision, and at the same time pointed out in the notice: "For parts that have not been paid for upon return, each copy will still be promoted at the current price of 1,200 yuan."

I believe that the Southwest Office made a book printing plan blindly without serious investigation and research beforehand, resulting in serious stockpiling of state funds; but after the problem occurred, the two parties did not consider it carefully, nor did they ask the local news and publishing authorities for instructions, and decided to destroy a large number of books. This is a serious mistake. In order to properly handle this part of the stockpiled books, it should be sold at a reduced price, or donated to the urban and rural people through the organizations of democratic women's federations in various places, so that it can play its due role in publicity as much as possible, so as to expand the publicity effect of the Marriage Law. However, the Southwest Office and the Southwest General Branch haggled over economic interests and did not consider the political impact, and rashly destroyed a large number of books, which is very wrong.

### 西南新华书店不该销毁书籍

    西南新华书店不该销毁书籍
      读者向融来信：西南人民出版社（现已改为人民出版社西南办事处，以下简称西南办事处），为了配合婚姻法的宣传，在一九五二年印了大批“中华人民共和国婚姻法图解”。当时由于过高地估计了销售量，以致计划太大，造成了严重的供过于求的现象。据新华书店西南总分店（以下简称西南总分店）最近不完全的调查统计，西南区的新华书店
  （包括地方国营的人民书店）共积压该书五十多万册，仅西南总分店就存有十六万册。
    西南办事处印刷工厂在印造该书的过程中，因为开展“三反”运动，有十六万二千余册延期交货。当时西南总分店依照合同规定将这一批书作为寄售处理。最近，西南办事处和西南总分店双方为了结清账务和结束该书的寄售手续，经过协商，决定由新华书店将该书用退货的办法进行处理；同时为了节省退书中的邮运费用，又决定由各地存货较大的新华书店按照规定的退书限额，将封面撕下寄交西南总分店统一向西南办事处退货。当然，被撕去封面的书籍就只好销毁了。西南总分店已根据决定通知下属发行单位执行，在通知中同时指出：“没有付退部分，每本仍按现价一千二百元推销。”
    我认为西南办事处先前未经认真调查研究，就盲目制订了印书计划，以致使国家资金招致严重积压；但当问题发生后，双方不经慎重考虑，也未请示当地新闻出版机关，就决定把大批书籍销毁。这是严重的错误。为了妥善处理这部分积压着的书籍，应该把它降价出售，或者通过各地民主妇联的组织，把它赠送给城乡人民群众，让它尽可能地去发挥应有的宣传作用，以扩大婚姻法的宣传效果。可是西南办事处和西南总分店斤斤计较经济利益，而不考虑政治影响，竟轻率地把大批的书籍销毁，这是很不应该的。
