The People of Wuhan Actively Participate in Flood Control Work

    Wuhan is vigorously carrying out summer flood control work, launching dike reinforcement and consolidation projects. The Yangtze and Han rivers both pass through the urban area of Wuhan, and it is surrounded by some lakes. The city's dike line is more than 110 kilometers long. This summer, there has been excessive rainfall in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, and the water levels of the rivers and lakes have continued to rise. The Wuhan Flood Control Headquarters has redeployed the flood control plan based on the development of the water situation, expanding the flood control project. According to the new project plan, the city's dike reinforcement and heightening requires 890,000 cubic meters of earthwork and 400,000 man-days of labor. Construction has started successively on various dike sections in Hankou, Wuchang, and Hanyang since the end of June and the beginning of July. Tens of thousands of laborers are working day and night, braving wind and rain, to complete this urgent and huge project. Many workers in the city have automatically participated in flood control work. Staff members of various government agencies, organizations, and enterprises, People's Liberation Army soldiers, and students from schools have all signed up to participate in flood control work. Many iron, bamboo, and wooden handicraft production cooperatives in the urban area are also rushing to produce various flood control tools and equipment. More than 100,000 farmers and skilled flood control laborers from Hanyang, Hanchuan, and other counties near Wuhan have come to support. On the Yangtze River, Han River, and transportation lines such as railways and highways, many ships, barges, sailboats, trains, and automobiles are transporting various flood control materials day and night. Telecommunications workers are rapidly and promptly erecting power lines on the long flood control construction site. The Central People's Government and the people of all parts of the country are also giving strong support to the people of Wuhan. In recent days, a large number of water pumps from various places are being installed and started to pump water to ensure the safety of dikes and the city.

    On July 4, leading comrades from the party and government leading organs of the Central South District, Hubei Province, and Wuhan City inspected all the dikes in the Hankou area, and focused on checking the Daijiashan Sluice Gate, the Jinyin Beach pumping station, and several other important dikes.

    武汉市人民积极参加防汛工作
    武汉市大力进行夏季防汛工作，展开堤防培修加固工程。长江和汉水都穿过武汉市区，周围还有一些湖泊环绕，全市堤防线长达一百一十多公里。今年夏季长江中游雨水过多，江河和湖泊水位不断上涨。武汉市防汛指挥部根据水情发展，重新部署了防汛计划，扩大了防汛工程。按照新的工程计划，全市堤防培修和加高需要八十九万土方和四十万个工作日的人工。汉口、武昌、汉阳各个堤段，自六月底七月初以来陆续施工。数万民工正不分昼夜，不避风雨，为完成这一紧迫、巨大的工程而努力。全市许多工人都自动参加了防汛工作。各机关、团体、企业的工作人员、人民解放军战士和学校的学生，都纷纷报名参加防汛工作。市区许多铁、竹、木器手工业生产合作社也赶制着各种防汛工具和器材。靠近武汉市的汉阳、汉川等县，有十多万农民和熟练的防汛民工前来支援。在长江、汉水以及铁道、公路等交通线上，许多轮船、驳船、帆船和火车、汽车日夜运输着各种防汛器材。电讯工人们迅速及时地在绵长的防汛工地线上架设电线。中央人民政府和全国各地人民也对武汉市人民给予有力的支援。这几天，来自各地的大批抽水机正在陆续安装和开始抽水，以保障堤防和市内的安全。
    七月四日，中南区、湖北省和武汉市党政领导机关负责同志巡视了汉口地区的全部堤防，并重点检查了戴家山水闸、金银滩的抽水机站和其他几处重要堤防。　（新华社）
