State-owned Shanghai Aquatic Products Company's Two Fishing Vessels
Break the Habit of "No Fishing During High Tide" and Overfulfill Tasks

During their voyage in mid-June, the No. 232 and No. 233 pair trawlers of the state-owned Shanghai Aquatic Products Company broke the old habit of "no fishing during high tide" and caught more than 2,700 boxes (approximately 100,800 catties) of small yellow croaker in ten days, overfulfilling the plan by 35 percent.

Some days ago, the vast East China Sea fishing grounds experienced a level 6 to 7 gale. After overcoming the risks, these two fishing vessels faced the onslaught of a high spring tide. At this point, they were still 500 boxes short of completing their original task of catching 2,000 boxes of fish. Based on the long-standing custom of "no fishing during high tide," the captain of the lead vessel telegraphed the Aquatic Products Company requesting an early return. The company immediately replied, instructing him to discuss with the crew and strive to return after completing the task. The crew calculated the time and found that there were still five days until the scheduled voyage end date. They immediately decided to persevere and strive to overfulfill the task.

The tide reached its peak in the last two days of this voyage. When the first net was hauled in, large schools of fish were seen floating in the net. The crew members were so excited by this unprecedented scene that they shouted. When they returned on June 21, all eight holds were fully loaded.

    国营上海水产公司两渔轮
    打破“大潮不拉鱼”的习惯超额完成了任务
    国营上海水产公司二三二、二三三号对拖渔轮在六月中旬出海期间，打破了“大潮不拉鱼”的旧习惯，十天捕小黄鱼二千七百余箱（约十万零八千斤），超额完成计划百分之三十五。
    前些日子，辽阔的东海渔区曾经刮过六至七级大风，这一对渔轮在战胜风险之后，又面临着大潮水的袭击。这时，距离完成原定捕鱼两千箱的任务还差五百箱，头船船长根据历来“大潮不拉鱼”的习惯，打电报回水产公司要求提前返航，公司立刻复电叫他和船员商量，争取完成任务回来。船员们计算了一下时间，距离规定的航期还有五天，当即决定坚持下去，争取超额完成任务。
    潮水在这次航期的最后两天进入高潮。第一网收网时，就看到大鱼群在网里浮动着。船员们为这从来没有见过的情景兴奋得叫喊起来。当六月二十一日返航的时候，八只船舱都满载而归。
