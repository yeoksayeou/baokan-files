    The height of summer has arrived in Moscow. Moscow's parks, gardens, and squares are shaded by green trees everywhere. Many new gardens and squares have been opened, and existing parks have been greatly expanded. This year, the government has allocated 30 million rubles for the beautification of various parks. Throughout the summer, the parks will hold more than 130 mass collective recreational activities. At Gorky Central Park of Culture and Rest, which is visited by more than six million people every year, the shade of the linden trees covers the granite embankments. In the summer, nearly a thousand different musical and theatrical performances are held here. On Sundays and holidays, or after work, thousands of visitors walk through the shade, through the blooming rose bushes, and play in the parks. The ancient Sokolniki Park is holding an architectural exhibition. In the children's garden of the park, rich cultural and recreational activities are prepared for children. Stalin Park, near the suburbs, is often visited by many people from the city center with their families on Sundays for a full day of rest. In the Alexander Garden, located next to the Kremlin walls, people who come to the Kremlin to attend various meetings often stroll and relax there. Various cruise ship terminals on the Moscow River have been opened. Various types of cruise ships and speedboats have successively entered the clear blue waves. This summer, Moscow's riverside bathing beaches have increased by four compared to last year, and the number of people admitted daily has doubled compared to last year. Every evening, near the beautiful fountains in Sverdlov Square and Pushkin Square, many Muscovites can be seen spending the beautiful moments of a summer twilight.
    This year, Moscow's summer life vividly reflects the remarkable achievements of the Soviet people in developing the consumer goods industry and developing commercial trade. This year, there are more than 3,000 more summer trading institutions in Moscow than last year. Various restaurants have increased. Stalls and carts selling various cold drinks can be found everywhere in parks, squares, stations, and bathing beaches. The city sells an average of more than 170 tons of ice cream every Sunday, and one Sunday Muscovites bought a total of 200 tons of ice cream. Many places have also organized special summer markets. The summer clothes, fabrics, and shoes supplied by the stores have a particularly wide variety of colors and patterns. Many people who have been to Moscow before and come back this summer feel prominently that Muscovites, especially women, are wearing more colorful and beautiful clothes this summer.

    莫斯科人的幸福的夏季生活
    盛夏已经来到莫斯科。莫斯科的公园、街心花园和广场，到处绿树成荫。许多新的花园和广场已开辟出来，原有的公园也大加扩充。今年，政府拨了三千万卢布来作为美化各个公园的费用。各个公园在暑天将共举办一百三十多次群众性的集体娱乐活动。在每年游人达六百万人以上的高尔基中央文化休息公园，菩提树的浓荫掩覆着花岗石的堤岸。夏季，这里将共举行近一千次的各种音乐和戏剧演出。星期天和休假日或工作完毕之后，成千上万的游人穿过浓荫，穿过盛开的玫瑰花丛，在公园四处游玩。古老的索科尼基公园正在举办建筑展览会。在公园的儿童园里，为儿童准备了丰富的文娱游艺活动。靠近郊区的斯大林公园，星期天经常有许多市中心区的人都全家到这里来，作整天的休息。座落在克里姆林宫墙边的亚历山大花园里，常常有到克里姆林宫参加各种会议的人们在那里散步休息。莫斯科河上各个游船码头都已开放。各式的游船和快艇相继驶进了潾潾的碧波。今年夏天，莫斯科的河滨浴场比去年增加了四处，每天接纳的人数比去年增加一倍。每到晚上，斯维德洛夫广场、普希金广场上美丽的喷泉旁边，可以看到许多莫斯科人在那里消度夏季黄昏的美好时刻。
    今年莫斯科的夏季生活鲜明地反映出苏联人民发展日用品工业和发展商业贸易的显著成就。今年在莫斯科出现的夏令贸易机构比去年多三千多处。各种饮食店都增加了。公园、广场、车站、浴场等地到处都可以找到出售各种冷饮的摊亭和小车。全市每星期天平均出售的冰淇淋达一百七十多吨，有一个星期天莫斯科人共买了两百吨冰淇淋。许多地方还组织了专门的夏季市场。商店供应的夏季衣服、布匹和鞋类，花色特别繁多。许多曾经到过莫斯科的人今年夏天重来时都突出地感觉到：莫斯科人，特别是妇女，今年夏季的衣服更加鲜艳和美观了，（新华社）
