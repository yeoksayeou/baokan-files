    Another Conspiracy by the United States to Oppose Peace
    Gao Ji
    As the Geneva Conference's discussion on the Indochina issue entered a crucial and decisive stage, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles intentionally avoided the Geneva Conference and held separate talks with the foreign ministers of Britain and France in Paris on July 13. International opinion has unanimously pointed out that Dulles' activities in Paris were aimed at exerting pressure on France and Britain to obstruct the Geneva Conference from reaching an agreement on the restoration of peace in Indochina. However, the results of the talks showed that Dulles was unable to stop the forward march of the world's people and all peace-loving forces in their efforts to achieve a ceasefire in Indochina.
    At the current stage of the Geneva Conference, countries with sincere wishes for the restoration of peace in Indochina are making their utmost efforts in Geneva to complete this important task. The forces of peace-loving people around the world, especially the people of France and Southeast Asia, have repeatedly thwarted the United States' conspiracies to obstruct and undermine the Geneva Conference. The collapse of the Laniel-Bidault cabinet of the French pro-war faction, and the opposition and rejection that the United States' plan to assemble a Southeast Asia defense group encountered in major Southeast Asian countries, vividly illustrate that the people's will to strive for peace is irresistible, and the aggressive and adventurous delusions of the United States' warmongers are doomed to failure. Precisely because of this, the discussion of the Indochina issue at the Geneva Conference is progressing steadily on the basis of agreements already reached. Under these circumstances, the foreign ministers of the Soviet Union, France, China, and Britain have successively returned to Geneva and have been in frequent contact. All parties believe that the contacts between the foreign ministers in Geneva will likely facilitate the conclusion of an agreement on the restoration of peace in Indochina.
    The development of the situation has plunged the United States' warmongers into unprecedented isolation. "The New York Times," the mouthpiece of the United States' ruling clique, also admitted that at the current stage of the Geneva Conference, "the United States is powerless to reverse the course of events." However, Dulles and his ilk have not shown any repentance as a result of this, but have instead adopted an openly resistant attitude towards the Geneva Conference. At a press conference on July 8, Dulles openly declared that neither he nor U.S. Undersecretary of State Smith intended to return to Geneva to participate in the Indochina issue conference. Dulles also reiterated this attitude before leaving the United States for Paris on the 12th. U.S. officials also stated: "Any agreement reached after the resumption of negotiations will be difficult for the United States to agree to." U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Congressional Relations Thurston Morton said even more unreservedly in a speech at Colgate University on July 11: "The United States will not participate in any" "agreement" on Indochina. He also said: "The United States is waiting for the UN General Assembly to make a decision in September (referring to Thailand's request to send a UN observer group to Thailand), while at the same time trying to establish a collective security system (referring to the Southeast Asia aggression group) as quickly as circumstances permit." This clearly exposes the purpose harbored by the U.S. State Department, which is to use the cowardly method of evading the conference to avoid the obligations that must be borne for the agreements to be reached at the Geneva Conference, so as to leave the door open for the United States to continue its sabotage activities.
    People have seen that at the same time that Dulles expressed his refusal to attend the Geneva Conference, Washington officials are stepping up their activities to put together a Southeast Asia aggression group, announcing a new military aid plan for Thailand to further expand the Thai army, and U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Radford even advocated that the United States should directly provide military assistance to Indochina to the French Federation member states of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. The obvious goal pursued by all these activities of the United States is to obstruct and undermine the restoration of peace in Indochina, and to maintain and exacerbate the tense situation in Southeast Asia.
    Under these circumstances, Dulles avoided the Geneva Conference and ran to Paris. In a speech upon arriving in Paris, Dulles openly stated that the United States "should not be involved in many aspects of the issues of primary concern at the (Geneva) conference." So, what is the United States concerned about? Dulles said: "We are indeed still very concerned about collective action taken by France, Britain, the United States, and other free nations." Dulles even shamelessly mentioned his trip to Paris three months ago to put together the so-called "united action," and said: "I still hold this view now." It can be seen from this that Dulles has not given up his plans to carry out aggressive adventures in Southeast Asia until now. His trip to Paris this time is still to drag France and Britain into his aggressive and adventurous plans, and to make them succumb to his policy of undermining the Geneva Conference.
    This once again proves that the United States is sparing no effort to prevent the Geneva Conference from reaching an agreement, so that peace in Indochina cannot be realized. Dulles's clamor about the Southeast Asia aggression group plan is to turn Indochina into a springboard for launching wars, and to squeeze out the positions of France and Britain in Indochina and Southeast Asia, in order to seize favorable strategic and economic positions in this region for United States monopoly capital. However, the United States' neo-colonialist plan is very unpopular; the process of the Geneva Conference is also the process in which this policy of the United States has encountered strong opposition and is increasingly bankrupt. Dulles was unable to realize his adventurous plan for "joint action" three months ago. Now, with the forces striving for peace having achieved great success, Dulles's attempt to reverse the direction of the situation and realize his conspiracy to undermine the Geneva Conference is clearly intolerable.
    Dulles's arrogant activities have been sharply criticized by French and British public opinion. The French "Combat" wrote: "There is no doubt that Mr. Dulles came to Paris to express the United States' unease. Because the Washington government is afraid that peace will be realized in Indochina." The French "Le Monde," in talking about Dulles's attempt to deprive Mendès-France of the freedom to conduct Indochina ceasefire negotiations, said: "From now on, no one can ignore the universal desire of France to stop the Indochina war, ignore the Vietnamese people's eagerness for independence, ignore the Viet Minh's extensive struggle for independence, and ignore the universal desire of the people of all countries, especially the United Kingdom, to avoid the expansion of the conflict. At the same time, no one can ignore the difficult situation of the French Expeditionary Force." International opinion believes that if Dulles is not afraid of peace, he should go to Geneva, where peace talks are being held.
    The people's desire for peace and the power of public opinion cannot be ignored. According to the communique issued after the Paris talks, Dulles accepted the opinions of the British and French foreign ministers and sent Undersecretary of State, a ministerial-level official, back to Geneva as soon as possible. The vague communique showed that the Paris talks did not produce the results that Dulles had expected from his hasty flight across the Atlantic. However, the communique also showed that the United States is unwilling to abandon its policy. Dulles even used the excuse of "not bearing primary responsibility for the Indochina war" to reserve a "limit of compliance" for the United States regarding an agreement on the restoration of peace in Indochina. People know that the Geneva Conference was convened based on the agreement of the Berlin Conference agreed to by the United States, and the task of the Geneva Conference is to restore peace in Indochina. Now, why does the United States want to reserve a "limit of compliance" for the agreements that may be reached at the Geneva Conference? United Press reporter Teller revealed that the United States will not participate in the guarantee of a peaceful settlement of the Indochina issue. From this, people can understand that Dulles and his ilk will continue to adopt various despicable means to obstruct and undermine peace in Indochina.
    The Paris talks communique did not mention the Southeast Asia aggression group that Dulles clamored about, but Western news agencies revealed that in his report to the U.S. National Security Council after returning to Washington, Dulles even said that the Southeast Asia aggression group would be established quickly, and believed that "(the Geneva) negotiations may still break down due to differences." The peace-loving people of all countries must continue to be vigilant against the arrogant ambitions of the United States' warmongers. All peace-loving forces should continue to work to ensure the success of the Geneva Conference, in order to completely defeat and eliminate the United States' policy of obstruction and sabotage, and to achieve the realization of a ceasefire in Indochina.

    美国敌视和平的又一阴谋活动
    高集
    在日内瓦会议关于印度支那问题的讨论进入决定性的重要阶段的时候，美国国务卿杜勒斯竟有意避开日内瓦会议，在七月十三日到巴黎和英法两国外长举行了单独会谈。各国舆论一致指出，杜勒斯到巴黎的活动是为了对法、英两国施加压力，以阻挠日内瓦会议对恢复印度支那和平问题达成协议。但是，会谈的结果表明，杜勒斯没有能够阻挡得了全世界人民及一切愿望和平的力量争取印度支那停战的前进的步伐。
    在日内瓦会议的现阶段，对谋求恢复印度支那和平怀着真诚愿望的国家，正为着完成这个重大的任务在日内瓦进行着最大的努力。各国爱好和平人民，特别是法国人民及东南亚人民的力量已一再挫败了美国阻挠和破坏日内瓦会议的阴谋计划。法国主战派拉尼埃—皮杜尔内阁的垮台，以及美国拼凑东南亚防务集团的计划在东南亚主要国家中遭受到的反对和拒绝，生动地说明了人民争取和平的意志是不可违抗的，美国的好战分子的侵略冒险的妄想是没有前途的。正是由于这样，日内瓦会议对印度支那问题的讨论在已经取得协议的基础上正在日益进展。在这种情形下，苏联、法国、中国、英国的外长已先后回到日内瓦去，并进行了频繁的接触。各方认为，外长们在日内瓦的接触，将有可能促成恢复印度支那和平协议的达成。
    局势的发展使美国好战分子陷入了空前的孤立，美国统治集团的喉舌“纽约时报”也承认在日内瓦会议的现阶段“要扭转事态发展的方向美国是无能为力的”。但是，杜勒斯之流却并不因此而有所悔改，反而对日内瓦会议采取了公开的抵制态度。杜勒斯在七月八日的记者招待会上就公然声称，他和美国副国务卿史密斯都不打算回到日内瓦去参加印度支那问题会议。杜勒斯并且在十二日离美去巴黎之前重申了他的这种态度。美国官方人士也曾表示：“恢复谈判后达成的协议将是美国难以同意的。”美国负责与国会关系事务的助理国务卿瑟斯顿·摩顿在七月十一日在科尔盖特大学发表的演说中更毫不掩饰地说：“美国不会参加任何”关于印度支那的“协定”。他并且说：“美国一方面等待将在九月召开的联大作出决定（指泰国所提出的要求派遣联合国观察团去泰国的要求），同时正在设法在情况容许下尽速成立集体安全体系（指东南亚侵略集团）”。这就十分清楚地暴露了美国国务院所怀抱的目的，就是要以逃避会议的卑怯手法，来躲开对日内瓦会议将达成的协议必须担承的义务，以便为美国继续进行破坏活动留下方便之门。
    人们看到了，在杜勒斯表示拒绝出席日内瓦会议的同时，华盛顿官方正在加紧进行拼凑东南亚侵略集团的活动，宣布了进一步扩充泰国军队的新的对泰国的军事援助计划，并且美国参谋长联席会议主席雷德福更主张美国将对印度支那的军事援助直接交给法国联邦成员国越南、老挝和柬埔寨。美国这一切的活动所追求的显然是要阻挠和破坏印度支那和平的恢复，并保持和加剧东南亚的紧张局势。
    在这种情况下，杜勒斯避开日内瓦会议而跑到巴黎去。杜勒斯到巴黎时发表的谈话，公开表示美国“不宜与（日内瓦）会议主要关心的问题的许多方面发生关系”。那末，美国关心的是什么呢？杜勒斯说：“我们的确仍然非常关心由法国、英国、美国以及其他自由国家采取集体行动。”杜勒斯居然还恬不知耻地提到他在三个月前为拼凑所谓“联合行动”而到巴黎的事，并且说：“现在我仍然抱着这样的看法。”由此可见，杜勒斯一直到现在还没有放弃他的在东南亚进行侵略冒险的打算，他这次到巴黎去依然是为了要把法英两国拖入他的侵略冒险计划，并使它们两国屈从他的破坏日内瓦会议的政策。
    这再一次证明了美国不惜一切力量来阻止日内瓦会议达成协议，使印度支那的和平不能实现。杜勒斯叫嚷的东南亚侵略集团的计划，就是要把印度支那变为发动战争的跳板，并在印度支那和东南亚排挤法国和英国的地位，以便为美国垄断资本在这个地区攫取有利的战略和经济地位。可是美国的新殖民主义的打算是十分不得人心的；日内瓦会议的过程也就是美国的这种政策遭到强烈的反对而日益破产的过程。杜勒斯在三个月前没有能够实现他的“联合行动”的冒险计划，那末现在，在争取和平的力量已取得很大成就的情况下，杜勒斯企图扭转形势发展的方向，实现其破坏日内瓦会议的阴谋，显然是不能容许的。
    杜勒斯的狂妄活动，遭到了法英舆论的尖锐抨击。法国“战斗报”写道：“毫无疑问，杜勒斯先生到巴黎来是来表示美国的不安的。因为华盛顿政府害怕和平在印度支那实现。”法国“世界报”在谈到杜勒斯企图剥夺孟戴斯—弗朗斯进行印度支那停战谈判的自由时说：“从今以后，谁也不能忽视法国要求停止印度支那战争的普遍愿望，忽视越南人要求独立的热望，忽视越盟为争取独立而进行的广泛斗争，忽视各国人民、特别是联合王国人民要求避免冲突扩大的普遍愿望。同时谁也不能忽视法国远征军的艰难处境。”各国舆论认为，如果杜勒斯不害怕和平就应该到正在举行和平谈判的日内瓦去。
    人民的和平愿望和舆论的力量，是不容漠视的。根据巴黎会谈结束后发表的公报，杜勒斯接受英法两国外长的意见，再度派遣部长一级的官员美国副国务卿早日返回日内瓦。含糊其词的公报表明，巴黎的会谈并未得出杜勒斯匆促飞越大西洋所预期得到的结果。但是，公报同时也显示美国不愿放弃它的政策，杜勒斯居然以“对印度支那战争不承担主要责任”为托辞，为美国对于恢复印度支那和平的协议保留了一个“遵守的限度”。人们知道日内瓦会议是根据美国同意的柏林会议的协议而召开的，日内瓦会议的任务是恢复印度支那的和平。现在，美国为什么要对日内瓦会议可能达成的协议保留“遵守的限度”呢？美国合众社记者特勒透露说，美国将不会参加关于印度支那和平解决的保证。由此人们可以了解到，杜勒斯之流是要继续采取各种卑鄙手段来阻挠和破坏印度支那的和平的。
    巴黎会谈公报没有提到杜勒斯大叫大嚷的东南亚侵略集团，但是西方通讯社透露杜勒斯在回到华盛顿后向美国国家安全委员会所作的报告中，竟说将从速成立东南亚侵略集团，并且认为：“（日内瓦）谈判还是可能因分歧而破裂”。各国爱好和平的人民对美国好战分子的这种狂妄野心必须继续提高警惕。一切愿望和平的力量应当为保证日内瓦会议的成功而继续努力，以彻底击败和排除美国阻挠和破坏的政策，以求得印度支那停火的实现。
