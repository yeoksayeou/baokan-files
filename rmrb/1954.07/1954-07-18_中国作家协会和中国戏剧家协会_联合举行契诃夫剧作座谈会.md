    Chinese Writers Association and Chinese Dramatists Association
    Jointly Hold Chekhov Drama Symposium
    The Chinese Writers Association and the Chinese Dramatists Association jointly held a Chekhov drama symposium on the afternoon of the 16th. More than 60 people attended the symposium, including: Tian Han, Hong Shen, Cao Yu, Chen Baichen, Cao Jinghua, and Jiao Juyin.
    The symposium was presided over by Tian Han, Chairman of the Chinese Dramatists Association, who also delivered a speech. He said that now the whole country and the world are commemorating the 50th anniversary of Chekhov's death. We also hope to take this opportunity to better learn from this great Russian realist writer, learn from his courageous spirit of yearning for freedom and hating the corruption and backwardness of the old society, and learn from his serious attitude towards life and his realistic writing techniques that emphasize inner truth.
    Cao Jinghua, who began introducing Chekhov's works to China thirty years ago, spoke at the meeting about his experiences in studying Chekhov's works. He said that Chekhov was a master of language, his prose is poetry, and it has a rich musicality, which we should strive to learn.
    Jiao Juyin started with the influence of Chekhov's play "The Seagull" on the Stanislavsky system at the Moscow Art Theater and briefly introduced some of the characteristics of Chekhov's plays. He said that Chekhov's scripts all require conformity to the truth of life and require breaking through the shackles of old forms; he is good at depicting the inner world of characters, and he is good at comprehensively reflecting the era background of life through the portrayal of various characters. His scripts are full of musicality, and the rhythm of life is particularly strong.
    Hong Shen emphasized in his speech that Chekhov was good at writing about the life and characters he was most familiar with, so his works were very brilliant. He can also use very short sentences to comprehensively reflect the essence of life and dig very deep.
    Then, Cao Yu made a speech on how Chinese playwrights should learn from Chekhov. He said that in Chekhov's works, there is a kind of enthusiasm for loving the people, loving life, and loving labor; we must learn to have a sense of love and hate and the ability to distinguish between beauty, ugliness, truth, and falsehood.
    Ge Yihong also introduced Chekhov's creative path at the meeting. (Xinhua News Agency)

    中国作家协会和中国戏剧家协会
    联合举行契诃夫剧作座谈会
    中国作家协会和中国戏剧家协会在十六日下午联合举行契诃夫剧作座谈会。参加座谈会的有：田汉、洪深、曹禺、陈白尘、曹靖华、焦菊隐等六十多人。
    座谈会由中国戏剧家协会主席田汉主持并致词。他说，现在全国、全世界各地都在纪念契诃夫逝世五十周年，我们也希望趁这个机会更好地向这位俄罗斯现实主义伟大作家学习，学习他渴望自由、痛恨旧社会腐朽落后的勇敢精神，学习他对生活的严肃态度和他的现实主义的着重内在真实的写作手法。
    三十年前就开始把契诃夫作品介绍到中国来的曹靖华在会上谈了对契诃夫作品研究的体会。他说，契诃夫是语言巨匠，他的散文就是诗，有着丰富的音乐性，这是我们应该努力学习的。
    焦菊隐从契诃夫的剧本“海鸥”在莫斯科剧院的演出所给予史坦尼斯拉夫斯基体系的影响谈起，扼要地介绍了契诃夫剧作上的一些特点。他说，契诃夫的剧本都要求合于生活的真实，要求冲破旧形式的束缚；他善于描写人物的内心世界，善于通过对各种人物的刻划，把生活的时代背景概括地反映出来，他的剧本充满音乐性，生活节奏特别强。
    洪深在发言中着重指出，契诃夫善于写他最熟悉的生活和人物，所以他的作品写得都很精采。他还能用很短的字句概括地反映出生活的本质，而且挖得很深。
    接着，曹禺就中国剧作家如何学习契诃夫问题作了发言。他说，在契诃夫作品中有一种热爱人民、热爱生活、热爱劳动的热力；我们要学习他对美、丑、真、假有爱恶之心和鉴别能力。
    葛一虹也在会上对契诃夫的创作道路作了介绍。　（新华社）
