    The second exhibition of the Beijing Chinese Painting Research Association has been open to the public in the Chengqian Palace of the Forbidden City since the 11th of this month. A preview was also held one day before the opening. The association held its first exhibition in July last year and subsequently selected some of the works to participate in the National Chinese Painting Exhibition in the autumn of last year. Over the past year, members have been working hard on their creations. Most painters have recognized the importance of realism, and some painters have begun to engage with real life, trying to select new things in reality as creative subjects, resulting in some new works. This exhibition features approximately 280 works. Examples include Huo Youcun's "New Office Building of the Red Star Collective Farm," Wu Jingting's "Sea of Clouds in Huangshan," and Wang Shengsheng's "Apples," all of which were produced after serious sketching and have a certain degree of change and improvement in the use of traditional techniques. Figure paintings such as Bai Xueshi's "Competing to Sell Surplus Grain," Chen Yuandu's "See Who Knows More Characters," and Zhao Shuki's "Barren Hillsides Become Productive Land," as well as works based on historical figures and folk tales, such as Xu Yansun's "Yue Fei," Ren Luying's "Legend of the White Snake," and Wu Guangyu's "Zhang Yu Boils the Sea," are all better works.
    The exhibition is scheduled to run until the 25th of this month.

    北京中国画研究会举行第二届展览会
    北京中国画研究会第二届展览会，已于本月十一日起在故宫承乾宫公开展出。开幕的前一日并曾预展一天。该会在去年七月举行过第一届展览会，接着并选出一部分作品参加了去年秋季的全国国画展览。一年来，会员们的创作是努力的，多数画家并认识了写实的重要，部分画家开始接触实际生活，尝试选取现实中的新事物为创作题材，因而出现了一些新的作品。这次展出的作品共约二百八十件，其中如霍右村的“红星集体农庄新建办公室”、吴镜汀的“黄山云海”、汪慎生的“苹果”等，都是经过认真写生后产生的作品，在运用传统技法上都有一定程度的改变和提高；人物画如白雪石的“争卖余粮”、陈缘督的“看谁识字多”、赵树棨的“荒山坡成生产地”等，以及以历史人物和民间故事为题材的作品，如徐燕荪的“岳飞”、任率英的“白蛇传”、吴光宇的“张羽煮海”等，都是较好的作品。
    展览会预定将展出至本月二十五日止。
