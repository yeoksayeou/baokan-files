Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, July 9th: Indonesian Prime Minister Ali Sastroamidjojo told United Press International reporters on July 7th: "In recent weeks, the balance of world power seems to have shifted." He mentioned that while Churchill and Eisenhower were holding talks, Premier Zhou Enlai visited India and Burma. He also noted that the People's Republic of China had sent its trade delegation to London and Jakarta.

He expressed, "It is hoped that the development of these changes will not only benefit Indonesia but also Asia and the entire world."

He said, "If these changes can materialize on a basis favorable to Asia, our desire for peace will be closer to being fulfilled. Only by abandoning the outdated policy of subordinating Asia's wishes to those of other continents can Asia's interests be satisfied."

He said, "I believe that the time has now come when all countries should coexist independently and begin to build a peaceful world in harmonious cooperation, in which every country can live and prosper freely."

He said, "The Republic of Indonesia is determined to continue its efforts to achieve this goal through its independent foreign policy of non-alignment, which it has adhered to until now."

Ali Sastroamidjojo reiterated Indonesia's determination to pursue an independent foreign policy, stating that the Indonesian government's policies cannot be altered due to the policies and intentions of certain countries.

"Indonesian News" commented in an editorial on July 8th on Sastroamidjojo's speech, saying that the balance of world power had indeed changed since Zhou Enlai and Nehru held talks and visited Burma. The newspaper said that the achievements of these prime ministers' talks demonstrated that only Asian countries themselves can make decisions on all issues related to Asian interests. These issues are no longer arranged by London and Washington. The newspaper went on to say that this change is beneficial to the People's Republic of China and all countries pursuing a policy of striving for world peace, and to peace-loving people. It is unfavorable to those who want to prevent the world situation from moving forward. This change will only bring misfortune to the policy of not wanting peace.

The newspaper said that the current development of the world situation makes Asian countries believe that restoring the legitimate status of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations is absolutely necessary.

The newspaper said: "The change has begun. This change will continue to exist and will develop more widely in the future. Any country attempting to stop the change in the balance of power that is conducive to achieving world peace is foolish, regressive, and will bring misfortune upon itself."

    印尼总理沙斯特罗阿米佐约发表谈话
    希望一切国家和平共处建立一个和平世界
    【新华社雅加达九日电】印尼共和国总理阿里·沙斯特罗阿米佐约七日向合众社记者说：“最近数星期以来，世界力量的对比似乎已发生了变化。”他谈到在邱吉尔和艾森豪威尔进行会谈的同时，周恩来总理访问了印度和缅甸。他并谈到，中华人民共和国已经派遣它的贸易代表团到伦敦和雅加达。
    他表示：“希望这些变化的发展不仅将有利于印尼，而且将有利于亚洲和全世界。”
    他说，“如果这些变化能够在有利于亚洲的基础上成为事实的话，我们的和平愿望就更接近于满足了。只有放弃使亚洲的愿望服从于其他洲的愿望的那种过时的政策，亚洲的利益才能得到满足。”
    他说，“我认为目前已到了这样的时候，一切国家应该独立共处，并在和谐的合作中开始进行建立每一个国家都能够在里面自由地生活和繁荣的一个和平世界。”
    他说：“印度尼西亚共和国决心要继续努力通过它到现在一直遵守的不依附任何一方的独立外交政策来达到这个目的。”
    阿里·沙斯特罗阿米佐约重申印尼要奉行独立的外交政策的决心，他表示印尼政府的政策不能因某些国家的政策和意图而加以改变。
    “印尼新闻”在八日的社论中评论沙斯特罗阿米佐约的谈话时说，自从周恩来和尼赫鲁会谈并访问缅甸以后，世界力量的对比确实发生了变化。报纸说，这几位总理的会谈所取得的成就表明，对于有关亚洲利益的一切问题，只有亚洲国家自己才能作出决定。这些问题不再由伦敦和华盛顿来安排了。这个报纸接着说，这种变化对中华人民共和国和一切执行争取世界和平的政策的国家和爱好和平的人民都有利。而对那些想阻止世界局势向前进步的人们却不利。这种变化只会使那种不希望和平的政策遭到不幸。
    这个报纸说，目前世界形势的进展，使亚洲国家认为恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法地位是绝对必要的了。
    这个报纸说：“变化已经开始了。这变化将继续存在，将来还要更广泛地发展。任何国家企图阻止有利于实现世界和平的力量对比的变化，那就是愚蠢的、退步的，并将使它自己遭到不幸。”
