Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 3rd. Guangxi Province's early rice is currently heading and flowering, and harvesting will begin in mid-July. This year, the province's early rice planting area has slightly expanded compared to last year's 11.8 million mu, and output is estimated to increase by seven percent compared to last year. Currently, farmers of all ethnic groups in Guangxi Province are actively repairing farm tools in preparation for the summer harvest, while also strengthening field management to strictly prevent natural disasters to ensure the harvest.

　　Since spring, rural areas in Guangxi Province have vigorously launched a production movement centered on mutual aid and cooperation. Farmers of all ethnic groups have repaired and built more than 17,100 small-scale water conservancy projects. Rong County Prefecture alone irrigated 1.51 million mu of farmland. The amount of fertilizer accumulated by farmers of all ethnic groups has generally increased compared to last year. In the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region, the amount of fertilizer applied per mu of early rice in 15 counties has increased by about 100% compared to previous years. Farmers of all ethnic groups have also actively improved production techniques and changed farming systems. In Pingfu Township, Wuming County, the area of rice fields planted with close planting of small seedlings has expanded from 20 mu last year to 2,000 mu this year; the area of rice fields changed from single cropping to double cropping has expanded from 250 mu last year to more than 5,400 mu this year. In PingLe Prefecture, dense planting of early rice accounts for more than 50%, and this item alone can increase production by 30 million jin of rice.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 2nd. Guangdong Province is expected to have a bumper harvest of early rice this year. In some areas of eastern and central Guangdong where early rice matures earlier, farmers have begun harvesting and are promptly selling it to the state to increase investment in summer plowing and planting. At present, from the four million mu of sandy fields along the coast to the more than 20 million mu of early rice in the four plains of the Pearl River, Han River, Leizhou, and Maonan, the rice has matured, with full ears, and a bumper harvest is expected. More than 20 counties, including Puning and Chaoan, where harvesting started earlier, have reported bumper harvests. The 100,000 mu of "Nante No. 16" early rice in Puning County has increased production by an average of 15% compared to last year. After the large harvest, the amount of grain purchased by the state will further increase. In order to do a good job in purchasing early rice, the Grain Bureau of the Guangdong Provincial People's Government has printed grain sales receipts and distributed them to grain purchasing stations and supply and marketing cooperatives in various places. After farmers sell their grain, the quantity is registered and given to farmers for safekeeping, so that the quantity of grain sold by farmers can be uniformly settled after the autumn harvest. The Provincial Grain Bureau also instructed grain agencies in various places to quickly inspect and repair roads, bridges, and ferries, and strictly prevent accidents involving people and animals that may occur when farmers sell grain.

    广西省早稻产量可比去年增加百分之七
    广东省农民及时出售已收割的早稻
    【新华社南宁三日电】广西省早稻正在抽穗扬花，七月中旬就可开镰收割。今年全省早稻种植面积比去年一千一百八十多万亩略有扩大，产量估计可比去年增加百分之七。目前广西省各族农民一面积极添补农具，准备夏收，一面加强田间管理，严防自然灾害，以保证收获。
    春季以来，广西省各地农村大力开展了以互助合作为中心的生产运动。各族农民共整修和新建小型水利一万七千一百多处，仅容县专区就灌溉了一百五十一万亩农田。各族农民的积肥量普遍比去年增多。桂西僮族自治区中，有十五个县每亩早稻的施肥量比往年增加一倍左右。各族农民还积极改进生产技术和改变耕作制度。武鸣县平福乡小株密植的稻田，由去年的二十亩扩大到今年的两千亩；单季改双季的稻田，由去年的二百五十亩扩大到今年的五千四百多亩。平乐专区早稻密植的占百分之五十以上，仅此一项就可增产三千万斤稻谷。
    【新华社广州二日电】广东省今年早稻丰收在望，粤东、粤中有些早稻成熟较早的地区，农民已开始收割，并在收割后及时卖给国家，增加夏耕、夏种投资。目前，从沿海四百万亩沙田到珠江、韩江、雷州、茂南四个平原的二千多万亩早稻已经成熟，穗粒饱满，预计可以丰收；收割较早的普宁、潮安等二十多个县已告丰收，普宁县的十万亩“南特十六号”早稻平均比去年增产百分之十五。大割后，国家收购到的粮食将更加增多。广东省人民政府粮食厅为了作好早稻收购工作，已印制售粮收据发给各地购粮站和供销合作社，在农民出售粮食后登记好数量交农民收存，以便秋收后统一结算农民售粮数量。省粮食厅并指示各地粮食机构迅速检查和修理道路、桥梁、渡口，严密防止农民售粮时可能发生的人畜意外事故。
