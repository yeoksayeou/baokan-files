Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 6th: Korean Central News Agency reported on the 6th that the Foreign Minister of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Nam Il, issued a statement on the conclusion of the Geneva Conference discussion on the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. The full text of the statement is as follows:

From April 26th to June 15th, the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference conducted discussions on the peaceful resolution of one of the most acute issues in Asia – the Korean issue.

Participating in this conference were representatives of the five major powers – the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, the United Kingdom, France, and the United States – and representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the Philippines, Turkey, Greece, the Netherlands, Colombia, Belgium, Abyssinia, Thailand, and Luxembourg.

The characteristic of this conference is the fact that the five major powers – the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, the United Kingdom, France, and the United States – participated for the first time in recent history. The first participation of the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, together with the Soviet Union, in an international conference is a fact of great significance in the future development of international issues.

This conference stipulated that one of its important tasks was to consolidate peace in Korea, peacefully unify Korea on a democratic basis, and resolve other issues related to Korea.

Completing this task is of great significance for maintaining peace in the Far East and the world, and for easing international tensions.

The delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Soviet Union, and the People's Republic of China, proceeding from the interests of the Korean people and the peace-loving people of the world, made consistent and utmost efforts at the Geneva Conference to peacefully resolve the Korean issue, in order to consolidate peace in the Far East and the world.

However, the United States and the South Korean puppet clique, along with representatives of other countries who followed them, disregarded all these efforts. They were unwilling to peacefully resolve the Korean issue, but instead plotted new military adventures, stubbornly opposed the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and disrupted the Geneva Conference discussion on the Korean issue, preventing the conference from completing the task of peacefully resolving the Korean issue.

(I)

The Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the People's Republic of China, and the Soviet Union took the initiative in bringing the Korean War to a ceasefire, creating the possibility of a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and making a huge contribution to easing international tensions.

The conclusion of the Korean Armistice Agreement became the first step toward realizing the peace and unification of Korea on a democratic basis.

However, the ceasefire does not mean complete peace. After the Korean Armistice was reached, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, proceeding from a peace-loving policy, immediately adopted and implemented various measures to restore the people's economy destroyed by the war, stabilize and improve the people's lives, and comprehensively transform the country and social life into a state of peace.

The Republic government concentrated all its efforts to comprehensively transition from a wartime state to a state of peace and to peacefully resolve the Korean issue.

The Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the various People's Democratic countries, striving to maintain peace in the Far East, gave tremendous assistance to the Korean people in their struggle for peaceful construction and peaceful reunification of the fatherland.

However, after the ceasefire, the US ruling clique and the South Korean Syngman Rhee gang took a path opposite to ours. The US and South Korean ruling cliques were unwilling to consolidate peace in Korea and realize the unification of Korea. They feared the easing of international tensions and took the path of preparing for new military adventures in South Korea.

After the conclusion of the Korean Armistice Agreement, the US government, in order to prepare for new aggressive military adventures, concluded the so-called "US-ROK Mutual Defense Treaty" with the Syngman Rhee puppet government, allowing US troops to continue to be stationed in South Korea. The Syngman Rhee gang constantly expanded the puppet army and clamored for "northward advancement." Simply citing these facts is enough.

The Korean people and the peace-loving people of the world urgently demanded the eradication of the above-mentioned facts, which pose a huge threat to maintaining peace in Korea and the Far East. The Korean Armistice Agreement stipulated that a political conference on the Korean issue should be convened, and this conference was tasked with peacefully resolving the Korean issue. However, the US ruling clique, fearing the easing of international tensions, obstructed the convening of this conference.

At the Berlin Four Foreign Ministers' Conference, due to the initiative of the Soviet Union, an agreement was reached on convening the Geneva Conference, thereby making it possible to discuss the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

The Korean people and the Asian people followed the process of the Geneva Conference with great concern. This is because they expected the Geneva Conference to reach an agreement on guaranteeing a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, so that a unified, independent, and democratic Korean state could be created, and international tensions could be eased.

(II)

During the Geneva Conference's deliberation on the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, it became clear that there were two fundamentally different positions and propositions on the Korean issue among the participants.

The position consistently upheld by the delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is that the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue must be in the interests of the Korean people and the peace-loving people of the world, and that the Korean issue is a matter for the Korean people themselves. Therefore, the task of peacefully unifying Korea on a democratic basis must be entrusted to the Korean people themselves. This position of our delegation received the full support of the delegations of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, and the unanimous support of all people concerned with maintaining lasting peace in the Far East and the world. This position of our delegation was clearly expressed in the proposal we put forward at the Geneva Conference on April 27th regarding "restoring the national unity of Korea and holding free all-Korean elections."

First, our proposal stipulated that all-Korean elections of the National Assembly should be held on the basis of the free will of all Korean residents, in order to form a unified government of Korea. This proceeded from the view that holding all-Korean elections must become an important stage in realizing the unification of Korea.

This task should be resolved by the Korean people themselves through consultations between North Korea and South Korea. To this end, it was stipulated that an all-Korean committee composed of representatives from North and South Korea should be formed.

The important task of the all-Korean committee is to prepare a truly democratic election law draft to ensure that the general elections can be held in a truly free atmosphere, and to take necessary measures to ensure all democratic rights and freedoms of all residents of Korea, such as freedom of assembly and publication, and freedom to nominate candidates for legislative bodies.

It was stipulated that, in order to create the necessary conditions for realizing the national unity of Korea, the all-Korean committee should immediately take necessary measures to implement economic and cultural exchanges between North and South Korea.

Second, our proposal stipulated that all foreign troops should be withdrawn from all areas of Korea within a certain period of time.

It is impossible to restore peace in Korea and peacefully unify Korea under the conditions of the presence of aggressive troops like the US troops, who have brought countless sufferings and disasters to the Korean people.

Therefore, our proposal stipulated that all foreign troops should be withdrawn from Korea before the all-Korean elections.

Third, our proposal stipulated that it is necessary for the corresponding countries that are most concerned with maintaining peace in the Far East to guarantee the peaceful development of Korea, and thereby create conditions to promote the task of peacefully unifying Korea into a unified, independent, and democratic country as quickly as possible. Such an agreement would be of great significance to the Korean people. This agreement could crush all attempts to plot new military adventures in Korea and guarantee peace in Korea.

The delegations of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China fully supported our delegation's proposal and declared their willingness to participate with other countries in carrying out the above tasks, and to undertake certain obligations regarding guaranteeing the peaceful development of Korea.

The proposal we put forward was based on the view that the national unification of Korea on a democratic basis can be realized by taking into account the national interests of the Korean people and the special circumstances that now exist in North and South Korea.

In this regard, we considered the method of reaching an agreement on the conditions for the national unification of Korea at this conference, in order to ensure that the achievements of the democratic reforms that the Korean people have made can be preserved, while also considering the special circumstances created in South Korea. The proposal put forward by our delegation opened up clear and broad possibilities for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. This proposal guaranteed the unification of the Korean state, independence, and the elimination of all foreign interference in the internal affairs of Korea on a democratic basis, while also stipulating external guarantee conditions for unifying Korea into an independent and democratic country in a consolidated peaceful environment.

The United States and the Syngman Rhee gang, along with the representatives of some countries that supported them, opposed the proposal put forward by our delegation from the very beginning. We proposed forming an all-Korean committee to prepare for and hold all-Korean elections and to implement countermeasures related to economic and cultural ties between North and South Korea. However, they stubbornly opposed this proposal.

The US representative and its followers opposed the formation of an all-Korean committee and put forward untenable arguments, as if this institution would act in place of government organs and force government organs to accept unacceptable unilateral decisions.

This institution was considered to be an institution of both sides, and all its decisions would not be passed according to the coercion of one side's representatives, but according to the unanimous agreement of both sides of this institution. Therefore, it is clear that the above excuses are completely unfounded.

Some representatives opposed the need for unanimous agreement between both sides of the committee on all issues to be resolved in the committee.

Denying the necessity of unanimous agreement between both sides of the all-Korean committee means denying the unification of North and South Korea on a democratic basis, and means wanting to impose the will of one side on the other. Everyone knows that the US ruling clique has not been able to achieve this attempt even by using force.

The United States and the Syngman Rhee gang, along with its supporters, were unwilling in the past and are still unwilling now for the Korean issue to be resolved by the Korean people themselves.

They said that the issue of Korean unification should not be entrusted to the Korean people themselves, but should be entrusted to foreigners to resolve, disregarding the Korean people's right to self-determination. In order to achieve this goal, they stubbornly put forward the absurd proposition that the Korean elections should not be implemented by the Korean people themselves, that is, the all-Korean committee composed of representatives from North and South Korea, but should be carried out by the South Korean puppet government and the United Nations. They attempted to persuade us in the name of the United Nations.

However, the prestige of the United Nations under the manipulation of the United States has been completely lost in Korea. The US aggressors, using the banner of the United Nations, brought unprecedented war disasters to the Korean people and gave the Korean people unbearable misfortune and pain. These are already well-known facts.

Under pressure from the United States, the United Nations has adopted a unilateral stance on the Korean issue from the beginning. It has lost its moral authority, so it is completely incapable of peacefully resolving the Korean issue. The United Nations participated in the Korean armistice negotiations as a belligerent party, and signed the armistice agreement as one of the belligerent parties. All of this confirms that the United Nations cannot take a fair position in resolving the Korean issue.

Obviously, to resolve the Korean issue, it is necessary to first consider the interests of the Korean people and the real situation in North and South Korea, in order to seek various possibilities and ways. However, the United States and its followers are unwilling to do so.

Some representatives believe that because North and South Korea are currently in a state of confrontation, holding elections by an all-Korean institution composed of the Korean people themselves will encounter many difficulties. Of course, the three-year bloody war has sharpened the relations between North and South Korea and increased the difficulties on the road to national unification.

The delegation of the People's Republic of China, considering this point, suggested that, in order to make it easier for the all-Korean committee to overcome the difficulties it will encounter in the practical work of holding all-Korean elections, a neutral nations supervisory commission composed of representatives of neutral countries that did not participate in the Korean War should be formed to assist and supervise the work of the all-Korean committee responsible for holding all-Korean elections.

We took into account the opinions of representatives of other countries on international supervision and expressed our agreement to this suggestion.

In this regard, we insisted that the establishment of international supervision should not violate the principle that foreign countries should not interfere in the internal affairs of Korea, which should be resolved by the Korean people themselves.

The United States, along with the Syngman Rhee gang and its supporters, rejected this suggestion and repeated their absurd proposition, which had been refuted to the point of being completely untenable, that the Korean elections should be supervised by a United Nations agency.

Because they could not produce any arguments to refute the establishment of a neutral nations institution to supervise the Korean elections, they distorted the facts and slandered the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission of the Korean Armistice, saying that this institution had failed to play any role.

Everyone knows that when the belligerent parties concluded the Korean Armistice Agreement, they reached an agreement that the supervisory commission should be composed of neutral countries that did not participate in the Korean War.

After the Korean Armistice was realized, the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission played a positive role in assisting the implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement.

Although the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission encountered many difficulties in carrying out its work due to the illegal actions of the US side, its merits cannot be erased.

The example of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission being able to supervise the implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement proves that the argument that such an international institution cannot properly supervise the free all-Korean elections is completely unfounded.

Our delegation insisted at the conference that the existence of foreign troops in the Korean region and the task of holding free all-Korean elections and realizing a unified state on a democratic basis cannot coexist.

In order to guarantee the Korean people's full exercise of the right to self-determination in handling their own country's internal affairs, all foreign troops must first be withdrawn from Korea.

The continued presence of US troops in Korea not only threatens the peace and security of Korea, but also inevitably leads to interference in the internal affairs of Korea, making it impossible for the Korean people to freely express their will in national elections.

Therefore, the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea is an urgent issue that must be resolved at the Geneva Conference. However, the United States and the Syngman Rhee gang, along with its supporters, opposed our proposal and put forward the absurd proposition that only the Chinese People's Volunteers should withdraw from North Korea, while US troops should continue to occupy South Korea.

In order to find excuses for their absurd proposition, they put forward the so-called argument that the nature of US troops and Chinese People's Volunteers is different. Of course, the nature between them is indeed different.

US troops came to Korea for aggression, and Chinese People's Volunteers came to Korea to prevent aggression.

The purpose pursued by those who oppose the simultaneous withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea is very obvious. The people who opposed the withdrawal of troops from Korea more stubbornly than anyone else were the US representative and the Syngman Rhee gang representative. Under the manipulation of the United States, the Syngman Rhee gang's representative exposed his despicable purpose at the conference without reservation, blatantly demanding that the United States further strengthen its interference in Korea. This shows that the fascist police system of South Korea's Syngman Rhee can actually only be maintained by relying on the bayonets of the US military. Therefore, the South Korean puppet gang needs US troops to continue to be stationed in South Korea.

The South Korean representative's proposition can only be supported by those who are plotting new military adventures in Korea, such as the US representative.

Some representatives from the West said that if foreign troops are withdrawn from Korea, the war will break out again. Thus, those who put forward this untenable argument are attempting to deny the legitimacy of the third item stipulated in our delegation's proposal, which is that countries most concerned with maintaining peace in the Far East should assume corresponding obligations to guarantee the peaceful development of Korea and prevent the recurrence of military action. The South Korean representative and its supporters put forward a proposition contrary to our delegation's proposal. They put forward the absurd proposition that after unifying Korea, they would then discuss guaranteeing peace in Korea, and that the "United Nations should guarantee the unification, independence, and democracy of Korea." In short, they attempted to refuse to maintain peace in Korea in advance in order to carry out unification by force. In order to achieve this goal without being subject to any restrictions, they attempted to place South Korea under the rule of the United States forever under the guise of the United Nations. The United States and the Syngman Rhee gang, along with its supporters, who opposed our proposal at the Geneva Conference, were only pursuing one goal: attempting to erase the achievements that the Korean people have made in North Korea, repeatedly and groundlessly insisting that North Korea should submit to the reactionary regime of South Korea's Syngman Rhee, which is dominated by the United States, and refusing any consultations, thereby disrupting this conference. This is no accident. Because they fear that if this conference achieves a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, they will not be able to turn the Korean people into their colonial slaves, and their attempts to permanently divide Korea and provoke new war adventures will be completely bankrupt, and international tensions will be eased, making it impossible for US monopoly capitalists to obtain high profits in the arms race. The attempt of the US ruling clique to expand the colonial rule system established in South Korea to the entire Korean peninsula cannot be realized. The lessons of the Korean War have clearly demonstrated this.

The residents of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea will never abandon their democratic achievements, which they have defended by suffering tremendous sacrifices, and no one can force us to abandon this achievement. The Korean people have learned more clearly from past history which of the political systems in North and South Korea is in line with their interests.

It is precisely for this reason that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea was able to achieve victory in the heroic struggle against US aggression and the Syngman Rhee puppet gang.

The Soviet army liberated our motherland from the slavery of Japanese imperialism, opening up a path for the Korean people to be able to create their own new history. In North Korea, the people became the masters of the country, and state sovereignty has been grasped in the hands of the people. The truly people's regime has brought fundamental improvements to the lives of the people of North Korea. As a result of the implementation of land reform in North Korea, the peasants of North Korea became the masters of the land for the first time in Korean history, rapidly improving their material and cultural living standards; while the peasants in South Korea, which is occupied by US troops, are in a completely different situation. In South Korea, land reform that conforms to the interests of the peasants has not been implemented. The so-called agricultural land reform implemented by the Syngman Rhee gang can only bring about more enslaved results for the peasants.

The establishment of the people's democratic system in North Korea has enabled the people to control the important enterprises of the country, implement the eight-hour work system, and the male and female workers have no worries about unemployment and hunger. Their efforts to work have led to the development of the people's economy and the rapid improvement of the people's lives. However, since Japanese imperialism was driven out of Korean territory, South Korea's economy has not only not recovered, but has become more dilapidated. The living conditions of the working people in South Korea are in a more miserable situation than in the past era of Japanese imperialist rule. The people of South Korea have no hope of improving their living conditions under the rule of the Syngman Rhee regime.

Under the democratic system in North Korea, the national culture has also been greatly developed; while the South Korean regime has not taken any basic measures in the economic or cultural sectors that are beneficial to the people.

The people of North Korea have become completely the masters of the country, living a free and happy life. On the contrary, the people of South Korea, under the fascist police terror system of Syngman Rhee, have been deprived of the most basic democratic rights and freedoms, and are suffering in terror, hunger, and darkness. All these facts show why the Korean people have shown such heroism and tenacity in the struggle against US aggressors and defending their rights; this also proves that any attempt to deprive the Korean people of their achievements cannot but be met with the firm resistance of the Korean people, and the result will inevitably be failure. At the conference, in order to seek a way to resolve the issue of the 48,000 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war who were forcibly detained in violation of the armistice agreement, the delegation of the People's Republic of China put forward a proposal that was agreed to by our delegation.

The US representative and its followers rejected the discussion of this proposal.

Since the opening of the Geneva Conference, the US ruling clique and the Syngman Rhee gang have clamored that this conference would not achieve any success. Their true position at the Geneva Conference was clearly expressed in the proposal put forward by the South Korean representative. This suggestion stipulated that elections should be held under the conditions of foreign troops occupying South Korea and on the basis of making North Korea submit to the puppet system established in South Korea under the interference of foreign troops. They even attempted to impose the anti-people constitution of South Korea on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. It is obvious that the drafters of this suggestion attempted, through their own suggestion, to use the Geneva Conference to replace the national interests of the Korean people with the interests of US interventionists. The fact that the delegation of the Syngman Rhee gang did not put forward its own suggestion until a month after our delegation put forward its proposal proves that the United States and South Korea and its supporters have no interest in peacefully resolving the Korean issue. They put forward their so-called proposal not to solve the problem, but to fundamentally destroy the basis for negotiation.

On the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, organizing an all-Korean institution to prepare for and hold elections and to restore economic and cultural ties between North and South Korea is a most important issue. Nevertheless, the Syngman Rhee gang's proposal completely avoided this issue. It advocated that the all-Korean elections should not be carried out by the Korean people themselves, but by foreigners, that is, by the United Nations.

The representative of the Syngman Rhee gang did not serve the national interests of the Korean people at the conference, but the interests of the US ruling clique. This was especially evident in their frantic opposition to the withdrawal of US troops from South Korea and their opposition to countries most concerned with maintaining peace in the Far East undertaking corresponding obligations to guarantee the peaceful development of Korea.

In the process of discussing our delegation's proposal, the positions of the conference participants became more obvious. The representatives of some countries that followed the United States completely exposed their attempts to disrupt the discussion on the Korean issue at the Geneva Conference. The Soviet delegation, which represented the interests of the Korean people and the peace-loving people of the world and made sincere efforts to finally resolve the Korean issue, took into account the above situation. With the purpose of reaching a preliminary agreement on the principle issues that could be approached and approached each other from the process of discussing the Korean issue, and then resolving the remaining issues on which there were differences of opinion, it put forward a suggestion at the Geneva Conference on June 5. The content of the Soviet suggestion stated the following basic principles:

1.  Free all-Korean elections should be held throughout the territory of Korea within six months in accordance with the principle of proportional representation.
2.  In order to prepare for and conduct free all-Korean elections, an all-Korean committee composed of representatives from North and South Korea should be established.
3.  All foreign troops should be withdrawn from Korea before the elections are held.
4.  Establish an international committee to supervise the all-Korean elections.
5.  It should be considered necessary for countries that have the most direct relationship to maintaining peace in the Far East to undertake obligations to guarantee the peaceful development of Korea.

The delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the delegation of the People's Republic of China fully agreed with this suggestion.

However, the US representative and its followers brazenly rejected this suggestion without being able to put forward any arguments.

This action further blatantly indicated that what they were pursuing was to prevent the discussion of the Korean issue from reaching any agreement, and they were eager to disrupt it as quickly as possible.

The positions of the delegations of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the People's Republic of China, and the Soviet Union are completely different from this. Despite the differences in opinion on some important issues, we continued to make efforts to seek a way to reach an agreement acceptable to each other.

Because the United States and its followers fundamentally refused to negotiate, the Geneva Conference's discussion on the Korean issue was in a situation where it could not move forward even one step. If an agreement could not be reached on the basic issues related to the elections held for the unification of Korea, then an agreement should be reached on other important issues, first of all, the issue of maintaining peace in Korea. This is a prerequisite for completing the task of unifying Korea.

Proceeding from the true interests of all people who hope to maintain peace in Korea and the Far East and ease international tensions, the delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, in order to discuss the issue of consolidating the Korean armistice and gradually turning the armistice into a state of peace, put forward the following proposal on the Geneva Conference on June 15: "On guaranteeing the state of peace in Korea." Under the conditions that the threat to peace in Korea has not been eliminated and South Korea is plotting new military adventure conspiracies, the discussion of this proposal is particularly urgent.

"The participating countries of the Geneva Conference agree that they will continue to strive to reach an agreement on the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue on the basis of establishing a unified, independent, and democratic Korean state.

In order to guarantee the state of peace in Korea:

1. It is recommended that the governments of the relevant countries take measures to withdraw all foreign troops from the territory of Korea as quickly as possible in accordance with the principle of proportionality.

The time limit for the withdrawal of foreign troops from Korea shall be decided by the participating countries of the Geneva Conference through consultation.

2. Within a period of no more than one year, the military strength of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea shall be reduced, and the military strength of both sides shall not exceed 100,000 people.

3. A committee composed of representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea shall be formed to study the conditions for creating a gradual lifting of the state of war and transitioning the troops of both sides to a peacetime state, and to suggest that the governments of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea conclude corresponding agreements.

4. It is considered that treaties involving military obligations that one part or another of Korea has with other countries are incompatible with the interests of the peaceful unification of Korea.

5. In order to create conditions for rapprochement between North and South Korea, an all-Korean committee shall be established to formulate measures to establish and develop economic and cultural relations between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea, and to implement the measures that have been agreed upon. (Including trade, account settlement, transportation, border relations, freedom of movement and communication for residents, cultural and scientific relations, etc.)

6. It is considered necessary for the participating countries of the Geneva Conference to guarantee the peaceful development of Korea, and thereby create favorable conditions for resolving the task of peacefully unifying Korea into a unified, independent, and democratic country as quickly as possible."

Zhou Enlai, Foreign Minister of the People's Republic of China, supported our proposal and suggested that a seven-nation conference with the participation of representatives from the People's Republic of China, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, the United States, France, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and South Korea should be convened on this basis to discuss measures to consolidate peace in Korea.

As long as you are even slightly concerned about maintaining peace in Korea and the Far East and the world, no one can oppose our proposal.

Only the guys who dare to openly express their unwillingness for peace in Korea can take a frivolous attitude towards this proposal. The United States and its followers, who opposed the proposal of our delegation that was fully supported by the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, took this attitude.

They could not put forward any proposals to oppose our delegation's proposal, and they refused it without studying our proposal. Here, it was even more blatantly expressed that they were unwilling to peacefully resolve the Korean issue.

They said that they want to rely on force to unify Korea.

The Syngman Rhee gang's old-fashioned "northward advance" clamor became more rampant after the conclusion of the Geneva Conference's discussion on the Korean issue. The day after the Geneva Conference's discussion on the Korean issue ended, the representative of the South Korean Syngman Rhee gang issued a statement, clamoring that "there is no obligation to abide by the Korean Armistice Agreement anymore." The South Korean puppet government clamored to act arbitrarily and choose the timing for a "northward advance."

The Korean people and the peace-loving people of the world will never allow the Syngman Rhee gang's provocative actions.

At the last meeting of the Geneva Conference on the Korean issue, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov proposed that the peace of Korea should not be threatened until the Korean issue is peacefully resolved on a democratic basis, thereby realizing the unification of Korea. His suggestion was as follows:

"The countries participating in the Geneva Conference have agreed that, pending a final resolution of the Korean issue on the basis of establishing a unified, independent, and democratic country, no action shall be taken that may be sufficient to pose a threat to maintaining peace in Korea.

The participants expressed their belief that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea will act in accordance with this declaration for the sake of peace."

The enemies of peace even refused to discuss the Soviet delegation's suggestion on maintaining peace in Korea and guaranteeing the peaceful development of Korea, thereby contributing to maintaining peace in the Far East and the world. Based on the fact that the United States and its followers blatantly expressed their intention to disrupt the progress of the conference, making it impossible for the Geneva Conference's discussion on the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue to reach any agreement, Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, put forward the following suggestion in order to enable the countries participating in the conference to continue to strive for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue in the future:

"The countries participating in the Geneva Conference have reached an agreement that they will continue to strive to reach an agreement on the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue on the basis of establishing a unified, independent, and democratic Korean state.

The issue of the time and place for resuming appropriate negotiations shall be agreed upon separately by the relevant countries."

The people who hinder the peaceful unification of Korea even rejected this suggestion from the delegation of the People's Republic of China. Their actions only more thoroughly exposed what purpose they came to Geneva for.

Under the banner of the United Nations, the representatives of the countries that participated in the war of aggression against Korea read out the so-called joint declaration of sixteen countries under pressure from the US representative.

In this way, they unilaterally announced the cessation of the Geneva Conference's discussion on the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

The US representative and its followers, when they refused a series of suggestions put forward by the delegations of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Soviet Union, and the People's Republic of China at the conference and fell into a difficult situation of not being able to put forward their own suggestions and not being able to find any arguments to oppose, read out the so-called declaration that had been written in advance and brought with them.

In the so-called joint declaration of sixteen countries, not only can no signs of peacefully resolving the Korean issue on a democratic basis be found, but it also brought out the United Nations resolutions that had already completely failed, attempting to defend the crimes of the US interventionists in obstructing the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

The so-called sixteen-nation declaration read out at the conference only showed more clearly to the people of the world the fact that the people who made this declaration are frantically opposed to the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

(III)

Based on the above, certain conclusions can be drawn.

The entire process of the conference more thoroughly exposed that the US ruling clique and its followers are unwilling to ease international tensions and are continuing to violently obstruct the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. The US ruling clique confirmed at the Geneva Conference that it still refuses to recognize the epoch-making transformation in the historical development of the Asian people, attempting to continue to maintain the outdated imperialist colonial system in Asia that has fundamentally collapsed, and for this purpose, it shelters a small number of reactionaries who are despised as enemies of the people everywhere. In particular, it does not accept the lessons that should be learned from the heavy defeat suffered in the war of aggression against the Korean people.

Through the Geneva Conference discussion on the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, it was further clearly exposed that today's US ruling clique is not only the enemy of the Korean people who are eager to peacefully unify their motherland, but also the enemy of all peace-loving people in the Far East and the world.

The people of the world further clearly recognized that the position of the governments of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in carrying out a tenacious and firm struggle for peace in Korea and the peaceful unification of Korea on a democratic basis, and for easing international tensions, is fully in line with the interests of the Korean people and the peace-loving people of the world.

At the Geneva Conference, the delegations of the great Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China made the utmost efforts entirely to maintain the national interests of the Korean people, to create conditions for the Korean people to peacefully unify Korea into an independent and democratic country as soon as possible by the Korean people themselves, and for the peaceful development of the Korean people.

The delegations of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea overcame the complexities and difficulties caused by all the provocative acts and delaying tactics of those who opposed the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and made unremitting efforts to promote the progress of the conference.

The Geneva Conference was unable to complete the task assigned to it of peacefully resolving the Korean issue due to the conspiracies and sabotage of the US ruling clique and its followers.

Nevertheless, we should consider that the Geneva Conference discussion on the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue has achieved certain results.

International conferences that solve any problem related to the interests of the Korean people cannot be solved without the participation of our representatives. Precisely for this reason, the representatives of the countries participating in the conference had to carefully consider the suggestions and speeches of the delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, which participated in the conference as the owner of the relevant issues and on an equal footing with the representatives of other countries. In particular, the fact that the People's Republic of China participated in the international conference as one of the five major powers is not only of great significance to the future development of international relations, but also opens up the possibility of fairly resolving international disputes and issues related to maintaining world peace, especially peace in Asia.

As shown by the international conference held in Geneva this time, it is impossible to solve any problem in the world today, especially problems related to the national interests of the Asian people and the maintenance of peace, without the participation of the great People's Republic of China.

The positions of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Soviet Union, and the People's Republic of China, which fully conform to the Korean people's right to self-determination and national interests, once again clearly demonstrated to the people of the world that this is a just position that consistently strives to realize the peaceful unification of Korea. In contrast, the claims of the US ruling clique and its followers in South Korea and some Western representatives further clearly exposed to the people of the world their unwillingness to peacefully resolve the Korean issue and to continue to maintain the US colonial policy towards Korea.

Although there were still serious differences of opinion on principled issues in the discussion on peacefully resolving the Korean issue on a democratic basis, it was proved from the process of the Geneva Conference that there was a possibility of reaching an agreement with each other on the discussion of certain basic issues.

The issue of Korean unification still needs to continue to be solved through negotiations in a consultative manner.

We are convinced that the unanimous desire and firm struggle of all the Korean people who yearn for the peaceful unification of their motherland, supported by the support of the peace-loving people of the world, will remove the temporary barriers between North and South Korea. Possibilities for unifying our motherland must be sought through mutual approach and mutual consultation.

The military adventure policies of the US ruling clique and its followers in South Korea, who attempt to drag Korea into the flames of war once again, will be crushed under the resolute struggle of all the people of North and South Korea and the opposition of the peace-loving people of the world, and must be crushed.

Korea must transition from a state of armistice to a state of peace, and must achieve peaceful unification on a democratic basis.

This is the unanimous demand of the Korean people who love their motherland, and it is the unanimous desire of all the people who love peace in the Far East and the world. The Korean people are unanimously rising up to

    就总结日内瓦会议关于朝鲜问题的讨论
    南日外务相发表声明
    【新华社平壤讯】朝鲜中央通讯社六日讯：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国南日外务相就总结日内瓦会议关于和平解决朝鲜问题的讨论发表声明。声明全文如下：
    从四月二十六日到六月十五日为止的日内瓦外长会议上，进行了为和平解决在亚洲形势中最尖锐的问题之一——朝鲜问题的讨论。
    参加这个会议的有，五大国——苏联、中华人民共和国、英国、法国、美国的代表和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、南朝鲜、澳大利亚、新西兰、加拿大、菲律宾、土耳其、希腊、荷兰、哥伦比亚、比利时、阿比西尼亚、泰国、卢森堡的代表们。
    这个会议的特点，是近来第一次有苏联、中华人民共和国、英国、法国、美国五大国参加的事实。中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国与苏联一起第一次参加国际会议，是在今后的国际问题发展上具有重大意义的事实。
    这个会议规定，以巩固朝鲜的和平、在民主的基础上和平统一朝鲜、解决其他有关朝鲜问题的问题为它的重要任务之一。
    完成这个任务，对维护远东及世界和平和缓和国际紧张局势，有着重大的意义。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、苏联和中华人民共和国代表团从朝鲜人民和世界爱好和平人民的利益出发，为了在日内瓦会议上和平解决朝鲜问题，以便巩固远东及世界和平，尽了始终如一的和最大的努力。
    但是，美国和追随它的南朝鲜傀儡匪帮及其他国家的代表却不顾这一切努力，他们不愿意和平解决朝鲜问题，却策划新的军事冒险，顽固地反对朝鲜问题的和平解决，破坏了日内瓦会议关于朝鲜问题的讨论，使会议未能完成和平解决朝鲜问题的任务。
    （一）
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、中华人民共和国和苏联主动地把朝鲜战争导致停战，造成了和平解决朝鲜问题的可能性，对于缓和国际紧张局势作了巨大贡献。
    朝鲜停战协定的缔结，成为在民主的基础上实现朝鲜的和平与统一的第一步。
    但是，停战并不意味着完全的和平。朝鲜停战达成以后，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国从爱好和平的政策出发，立即为恢复被战争破坏的人民经济、安定和提高人民生活、把国家及社会生活全面地转变为和平状态而采取了各种措施，并把它付诸实践。
    共和国政府为了从战时状态全面地转变到和平状态和和平解决朝鲜问题，而集中了一切力量。
    为维护远东的和平而努力的苏联、中华人民共和国和各人民民主国家，给了为和平建设与和平统一祖国而斗争的朝鲜人民莫大的援助。
    但是，在停战以后，美国统治集团和南朝鲜李承晚匪帮走着和我们相反的道路。美国和南朝鲜的统治集团不愿意巩固朝鲜的和平，实现朝鲜的统一，他们害怕国际紧张局势的缓和，在南朝鲜走着准备新的军事冒险的道路。
    朝鲜停战协定缔结以后，美国政府为了准备新的侵略的军事冒险，和李承晚傀儡政府缔结了所谓“美韩共同防御条约”，使美国军队继续留驻在南朝鲜。李承晚匪帮不断地扩充傀儡军队，叫嚣“北进”。仅举出这些事实就够了。
    朝鲜人民和全世界爱好和平的人民迫切地要求根除对于维护朝鲜和远东的和平成为巨大威胁的上述事实。朝鲜停战协定中规定要召开关于朝鲜问题的政治会议，对这个会议赋予了和平解决朝鲜问题的任务。但是，害怕缓和国际紧张局势的美国统治集团却阻挠这个会议的召开。
      在柏林四国外长会议上，由于苏联的主动，达成了关于召开日内瓦会议的协议，从而使关于和平解决朝鲜问题的讨论成为可能。
      朝鲜人民和亚洲人民非常关心地注视着日内瓦会议的过程。这是因为他们期望日内瓦会议能够在保证朝鲜问题的和平解决上达成协议，使统一、独立的民主主义朝鲜国家得以创建，并缓和国际紧张局势。
    （二）
      日内瓦会议在审议关于和平解决朝鲜问题的过程中，表明了在会议参加者们之间，对朝鲜问题有着原则上不同的两种立场和主张。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表团始终如一坚持着的立场是：和平解决朝鲜问题必须符合朝鲜人民和世界爱好和平人民的利益，朝鲜问题是朝鲜人民自己的事情。因此，在民主的基础上和平统一朝鲜的事业，必须交给朝鲜人民自己。我国代表团的这种立场受到了苏联和中华人民共和国代表团的完全支持，受到了关心维护远东及世界持久和平的一切人们的一致支持。我国代表团的这种立场，已在四月二十七日的日内瓦会议上我们所提出的关于“恢复朝鲜的国家统一和举行全朝鲜自由选举”的方案中明白地表示出来了。
    第一，我们的方案规定了，在全朝鲜居民表示自由意志的基础上，举行国民议会的全朝鲜选举，以组成朝鲜的统一政府。这是从举行全朝鲜选举必须成为实现朝鲜统一的重要阶段出发的。
    这一任务应该由朝鲜人民自己以北朝鲜和南朝鲜之间协商的方法加以解决，为此，规定由南北朝鲜代表组成全朝鲜委员会。
    全朝鲜委员会的重要任务，是准备为保证能够在真正的自由气氛中举行总选举的真正民主的选举法草案，采取必要措施，以保证朝鲜的一切居民的集会、出版的自由，推选立法机关候选人的自由等公民的一切民主和自由。
    规定为了创造为实践朝鲜的国家统一的必要条件，全朝鲜委员会应立即采取为实施南北朝鲜之间的经济及文化交流的必要措施。
    第二，我们的方案规定，在一定的期限内，一切外国军队从朝鲜全部地区撤退。
    在如同给朝鲜人民带来了无数痛苦和灾难的美国军队那样的侵略军队驻留的条件下，恢复朝鲜的和平与和平统一朝鲜是不可能的。
    因此，我们的方案规定，在全朝鲜选举以前一切外国军队要从朝鲜撤退。
    第三，我们的方案规定由对维护远东和平具有最大关心的相应国家，有必要保障朝鲜的和平发展，并从而有必要创造条件以促使尽速完成以和平方式把朝鲜统一成为一个统一的、独立的、民主的国家的任务。这样的协议对朝鲜人民有着巨大的意义。这个协议，是可以粉碎一切在朝鲜策划新军事冒险的企图和保障朝鲜的和平的。
    苏联和中华人民共和国代表团完全支持我国代表团的方案，并声明愿意和其他国家一道参加执行上述任务，愿意承担关于保障朝鲜和平发展的一定义务。
    我们提出的方案，是基于认为在民主基础上的朝鲜的国家统一，必须在照顾到朝鲜人民的民族利益和现在在南北朝鲜所造成的特殊情形的条件下，有可能实现的观点出发的。
    在这一点上，我们曾考虑了在这个会议上，以谋求使朝鲜人民已取得的民主改革的成就能够保存下去，同时考虑在南朝鲜所造成的特殊情势的协议条件的方法，来达成朝鲜的国家统一。我们代表团所提出的方案，打开了为和平解决朝鲜问题的明白而广泛的可能性。这个方案保证了在民主基础上的朝鲜国家的统一、独立和对朝鲜内政的一切外国干涉的消除，同时规定了为在巩固的和平环境中把朝鲜统一成为一个独立的民主的国家的外部保障条件。
    美国和李承晚匪帮以及支持它的一些国家的代表们，在一开始便反对我们代表团所提出的方案。为了准备和举行全朝鲜选举和实施与南北朝鲜之间的经济及文化联系有关的对策，我们提议组成全朝鲜委员会。但是他们却固执地反对这个提议。
    美国代表和它的追随者们反对组成全朝鲜委员会，并提出了站不住脚的论点，好像是这种机构将代替政府机关行事和强使政府机关接受不可接受的片面决定。
    这一机构已被考虑到应当成为双方的机构，同时，它的一切决定不是按照一方代表的强求而通过，而是按照这一机构的双方的一致协议来通过，因此，很明显，上述的借口是完全没有根据的。
    一部分代表反对在该委员会中应根据该委员会的双方之间的全面的协议来解决一切问题。
    否认全朝鲜委员会双方之间的一致协议的必要性，就意味着否认在民主的基础上来统一南北朝鲜，意味着想把一方的意志强加于另一方。大家都知道，美国统治集团使用武力也没有能够实现这种企图。
    美国和李承晚匪帮以及它的支持者们过去不愿意而现在仍不愿意朝鲜问题由朝鲜人民自己来解决。
    他们说朝鲜的统一问题不应该交给朝鲜人民自己，而应交给外国人，由他们来解决，他们无视朝鲜人民的自主权。为了达到他们的这一目的，他们固执地提出朝鲜的选举不应由朝鲜人民自己，即南北朝鲜代表所组成的全朝鲜委员会来实施，而应由南朝鲜傀儡政府和联合国来进行的荒谬主张，他们曾企图以联合国的名义来说服我们。
    但是，在美国的操纵下联合国的威信在朝鲜丧失净尽，美国侵略者利用联合国的旗帜给朝鲜人民带来了史无前例的战争惨祸，给了朝鲜人民以忍无可忍的不幸和痛苦，这些已经是大家都知道的事实。
    在美国的压力下，联合国对于朝鲜问题一开始就采取了片面的立场，它已经丧失了道义上的权威，所以它对和平解决朝鲜问题完全是无能为力的。联合国以交战一方的资格参加了朝鲜停战谈判，以交战双方的一方在停战协定上签了字。这一切确证：联合国不能在解决朝鲜问题中采取公正立场。
    显然，要解决朝鲜问题，需要首先考虑朝鲜人民的利益和南北朝鲜的现实的情势，以寻求各种可能和途径。但是，美国和它的追随者不愿意这样做。
    一部分代表认为，因为现在南北朝鲜正处在对峙状态，所以由朝鲜人民自己组成的全朝鲜的机构举行选举，会碰到不少的困难。当然，历经三年的流血战争，使南北朝鲜的关系更加尖锐化，在使国家统一的道路上增加了困难。
    中华人民共和国代表团考虑到这一点，为使全朝鲜委员会能够比较容易地克服将在举行全朝鲜选举的实际工作中碰到的困难，建议由没有参加朝鲜战争的中立国代表组成中立国监察委员会，以协助和监察负责举行全朝鲜选举的全朝鲜委员会的工作。
    我们考虑到其他国家代表就国际监察提到的意见，对这个建议表示了同意。
    就此，我们坚持了国际监察的建立不应违反外国不对应由朝鲜人民自己来解决的朝鲜内政进行干涉的原则。
    美国同李承晚匪帮和它的支持者拒绝了这个建议，又重复他们的已经被驳斥得体无完肤的由联合国机构监察朝鲜选举的荒谬主张。
    因为他们拿不出任何能够反驳建立监察朝鲜选举的中立国机构的论据，他们又歪曲事实，诬蔑朝鲜停战中立国监察机构，说这个机构未能起任何作用。
    大家知道，交战双方在缔结朝鲜停战协定时，达成协议由没有参加朝鲜战争的中立国组成监察委员会。
    在朝鲜停战实现以后，中立国监察委员会在协助朝鲜停战协定的实施上起了肯定的作用。
    中立国监察委员会在执行自己的工作中，虽然由于美方的非法行为，使它碰到了不少困难，但是
    它的功绩是不能被抹煞的。
    中立国监察委员会能够监督朝鲜停战协定的实施的实例证明，关于这样的国际机构不能对全朝鲜的自由选举进行适当的监察的论调，是丝毫没有根据的。
    我国代表团在会议上坚持了朝鲜地区外国军队的存在和举行全朝鲜自由选举、在民主的基础上实现统一国家的任务是不能并立的主张。
    为了保障朝鲜人民完全行使由自己来处理自己国家的内政的自主权，首先必须从朝鲜撤退一切外国军队。
    美军继续驻留朝鲜，不但威胁着朝鲜的和平和安全，而且会不可避免地造成对朝鲜内政的干涉，使朝鲜人民不能在全国性的选举中自由地表示自己的意志。
    因此，从朝鲜撤退一切外国军队是日内瓦会议必须解决的迫切问题。但是，美国和李承晚匪帮以及它的支持者们却反对我们的提案，并且提出了只是中国人民志愿军从北朝鲜撤退，而美国军队继续占领南朝鲜的荒谬主张。
    它们为了给自己的荒谬主张找借口，提出了所谓美国军队和中国人民志愿军的性质不同的论据。当然，他们之间的性质确实是不同的。
    美国军队是为了侵略来到朝鲜的，中国人民志愿军是为了防止侵略来到朝鲜的。
    反对从朝鲜同时撤退一切外国军队的人所追求的目的是很明显的。比谁都顽固地反对从朝鲜撤军的人则是美国代表和李承晚匪帮代表。在美国操纵下的李承晚匪帮的代表，在会议上对他的卑鄙的目的无遗地暴露了出来，他露骨地要求美国要进一步加强对朝鲜的干涉。这说明了南朝鲜李承晚的法西斯警察制度实际上只有依靠美军的刺刀才能维持。因此，南朝鲜傀儡匪帮需要美国军队在南朝鲜继续驻留。
    南朝鲜代表的主张，只能受到像美国代表那样的在朝鲜策划新的军事冒险的分子们的支持。
    西方的一些代表说，如果从朝鲜撤退外国军队，战争将会再起。这样，提出这种不能成立的论据的人们，是企图不承认我国代表团的方案中第三项所规定的关于由对维护远东和平具有最大关心的相应国家保证朝鲜的和平发展并防止军事行动再起的正当性。南朝鲜代表和它的支持者提出了和我们代表团的方案相反的主张，他们提出在统一朝鲜以后，再谈保证朝鲜的和平，由“联合国来保证朝鲜的统一、独立和民主”的荒谬主张。总之，他们企图事先拒绝维护朝鲜的和平，以实行武力统一。他们为了达到这个目的而不受任何约束，企图在联合国的幌子下，把南朝鲜永远置于美国的统治之下。在日内瓦会议上反对我国方案的美国和李承晚匪帮以及它的支持者，只是追求一个目的，即：企图抹煞朝鲜人民在北朝鲜已取得的成果，一再毫无根据地坚持要北朝鲜屈服于在美国支配下的南朝鲜李承晚反动政权，并拒绝任何协商，从而破坏这一会议。这不是偶然的事。因为他们害怕如果这一会议使朝鲜问题得到和平解决，将不能把朝鲜人民变为他们的殖民地奴隶，使他们的长期分裂朝鲜和挑起新战争冒险的企图完全破产，并会使国际紧张局势得到缓和，使美国垄断资本家不能在军备竞赛中获取高额的利润。美国统治集团要把在南朝鲜建立的殖民地统治制度扩大到全朝鲜的企图是不能实现的，朝鲜战争的教训已经明白地表明了这一点。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的居民，绝不会抛弃用遭受莫大的牺牲来捍卫的自己的民主成果，而且谁也不能强迫我们抛弃这一成果。朝鲜人民已从过去的历史中更加清楚地知道，在南北朝鲜的政体中哪一个是符合于自己的利益的。
    正因为这个原因，所以，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国在反对美国侵略和李承晚傀儡匪帮的英勇斗争中能够取得胜利。
    苏联军队从日本帝国主义的奴役下解放了我们的祖国，在朝鲜人民面前打开了能够创造自己的新的历史的道路。在北朝鲜，人民成了国家的主人，国家主权已掌握在人民的手里。真正的人民政权给北朝鲜人民的生活开始带来了根本的改善。北朝鲜实施土地改革的结果，使北朝鲜的农民在朝鲜历史上第一次成为土地的主人，迅速地提高了物质、文化生活水平；而在美军强占下的南朝鲜农民则处在和这完全不同的境地。在南朝鲜并没有实施符合农民利益的土地改革。李承晚匪帮所实施的所谓农地改革，只能给农民带来更加奴隶化的结果。
    北朝鲜人民民主制度的建立，使人民掌握了国家的重要企业，实施了八小时工作制，男女工人没有失业和饥饿的顾虑，努力进行工作，已导致了人民经济的发展和人民生活的迅速提高。但是，自从日本帝国主义从朝鲜领土上被赶走了以后，南朝鲜的经济不仅没有恢复，却更加衰落了。南朝鲜劳动人民的生活状况处于比过去日本帝国主义统治时代更加悲惨的境地。南朝鲜人民在李承晚政权的统治下，是没有改善自己的生活状况的希望的。
    在北朝鲜民主制度的条件下，民族文化也得到很大发展；而南朝鲜政权在经济部门或文化部门没有采取任何对人民有利的基本措施。
    北朝鲜人民完全成为国家的主人，过着自由和幸福的生活。相反地，南朝鲜人民在李承晚的法西斯警察恐怖制度下，被剥夺了起码的民主权利和自由，在恐怖、饥饿和黑暗中受着折磨。这一切事实说明，朝鲜人民为什么在反对美国侵略者、捍卫自己的权利的斗争中，表现得那么英勇，那么顽强；这同时证明，任何要从朝鲜人民剥夺他们所取得的成就的企图，都不能不受到朝鲜人民的坚决的回击，结果必然遭到失败。会议上，为了寻求解决关于违反停战协定而被强迫扣留的四万八千名朝中战俘的问题的途径，中华人民共和国代表团提出了为我国代表团所同意的方案。
    美国代表和它的追随者竟拒绝讨论这个方案。
    美国统治集团和李承晚匪帮自从日内瓦会议开幕以来，就叫嚣这个会议不会取得任何成就。他们在日内瓦会议上的真正立场，明白地表现在南朝鲜代表所提出的方案中。这个建议规定，在外国军队占领南朝鲜的条件下，并在使北朝鲜服从于在外国军队的干涉下在南朝鲜建立的傀儡制度的基础上，举行选举。他们甚至企图把南朝鲜的反人民的宪法强加于朝鲜民主主义人民共和国。显而易见，这个建议的制订者企图通过自己的建议，利用日内瓦会议，以美国干涉者的利益代替朝鲜人民的民族利益。李承晚匪帮的代表团，在我们代表团提出了方案一个月以后，才提出了自己的建议，仅这一事实就证明美国和南朝鲜及其支持者对于和平解决朝鲜问题没有什么兴趣。他们不是为了解决问题，而是为了制造根本破坏协商的基础，才提出了自己的所谓方案罢了。
    在和平解决朝鲜问题上，为了准备和举行选举和为了恢复南北朝鲜之间的经济及文化联系而组织全朝鲜机构，是一个最重要的问题。尽管如此，李承晚匪帮的提案完全回避了这一问题。他主张全朝鲜选举不是由朝鲜人民自己来进行，而是由外国人即由联合国来进行。
    李承晚匪帮的代表在会议上不是为朝鲜人民的民族利益服务，而是为美国统治集团的利益服务。这特别在他们疯狂地反对从南朝鲜撤退美国军队，反对由对维护远东和平具有最大关心的国家承担相应的义务以保证朝鲜的和平发展等问题上，更加明显地表现出来。
    在讨论我国代表团的方案的过程中，会议参加者的立场表现得更加明显了。追随美国的一些国家的代表们，在日内瓦会议上完全暴露了他们破坏关于朝鲜问题的讨论的企图。代表着朝鲜人民和全世界爱好和平人民的利益，为了最后解决朝鲜问题而作真诚努力的苏联代表团，考虑了上述情况，从讨论朝鲜问题的过程中把相互接近和可以接近的原则问题先达成初步协议、然后来解决剩下的存在意见分歧的问题的目的出发，在六月五日的日内瓦会议上提出了建议。苏联建议的内容，陈述了如下的基本原则：
    一、在六个月以内根据比例代表制的原则在全朝鲜境内举行全朝鲜自由选举。
    二、为准备和进行全朝鲜自由选举，应建立由南北朝鲜代表组成的全朝鲜委员会。
    三、在举行选举以前一切外国军队应从朝鲜撤退。
    四、建立监督全朝鲜选举的国际委员会。
    五、应该认为对维护远东和平有最直接关系的国家有必要承担义务来保证朝鲜的和平发展。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表团和中华人民共和国代表团完全同意这一建议。
    但是，美国代表和它的追随者们提不出任何的论据就悍然地拒绝了这一建议。
    这种行动更加露骨地表示了：他们所追求的只是使朝鲜问题的讨论不能达成任何协议，急于尽速地加以破坏。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、中华人民共和国和苏联的代表团的立场和这完全不同。尽管在一些重要问题上意见存在着分歧，但是，我们为了谋求使彼此都能接受的协议的途径，而继续进行了努力。
    由于美国和它的追随者根本拒绝协商，使日内瓦会议关于朝鲜问题的讨论陷于一步也不能前进的处境。如果对于为统一朝鲜而举行的选举有关的基本问题不能达成协议，那么对其他的重要问题，首先是对于维护朝鲜和平的问题应该取得协议。这是完成朝鲜统一事业的先决条件。
    从希望维护朝鲜和远东和平和缓和国际紧张局势的一切人们的真实利益出发，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表团，为了讨论有关巩固朝鲜停战和使停战逐渐转入和平状态的问题，六月十五日在日内瓦会议上提出了如下的“关于保证朝鲜的和平状态”的方案。在对朝鲜和平的威胁还没有消除、南朝鲜在策划新的军事冒险阴谋的条件下，这一方案的讨论是尤其迫切需要的。
      “日内瓦会议参加国同意，它们将继续努力谋求在成立一个统一、独立和民主的朝鲜国家的基础上达成和平解决朝鲜问题的协议。
    为了保证朝鲜的和平状态：
    一、建议各有关国家的政府采取措施，遵照按比例的原则尽速从朝鲜境内撤退一切外国军队。
    从朝鲜撤退外国军队的期限，由日内瓦会议的参加国协议决定。
    二、在不超过一年的期限中，缩减朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和大韩民国的军队力量，双方军力不得超过十万人。
    三、由朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和大韩民国的代表组成一个委员会，来研究创造逐步解除战争状态的条件，将双方军队转入和平时期状态等问题，并建议朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和大韩民国政府缔结相应的协定。
    四、认为朝鲜的这一部分或者另一部分和其他国家订有牵涉到军事义务的条约，是和和平统一朝鲜的利益不相容的。
    五、为了创造使南北朝鲜接近的条件，成立一个全朝鲜委员会来拟订建立和发展朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和大韩民国之间的经济和文化关系的措施，并执行已取得协议的措施。（其中包括贸易、账目结算、运输、边境关系、居民的通行和通信自由、文化和科学关系及其他。）
    六、认为日内瓦会议的参加国有必要保证朝鲜的和平发展，并从而为尽速解决把朝鲜和平统一为一个统一、独立和民主的国家的任务创造有利的条件。”
    中华人民共和国周恩来外交部长，支持我们的方案，并建议以此为基础，召开有中华人民共和国、苏联、英国、美国、法国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、南朝鲜的代表参加的七国会议，讨论谋求巩固朝鲜和平的措施。
    只要稍许关心维护朝鲜和远东以及世界的和平，谁都不能反对我们的方案。
    只有胆敢公开地表明不愿意朝鲜和平的家伙们，才能对这个方案采取轻率的态度。反对受到苏联和中华人民共和国的完全支持的我国代表团方案的美国和它的追随者，就采取了这种态度。
    他们提不出任何反对我国代表团方案的方案，并没有研究我们的方案，便拒绝了它。在这里，就更加露骨地表现了他们不愿意和平解决朝鲜问题。
    他们说，要依靠武力来统一朝鲜。
    李承晚匪帮的老一套的“北进”叫嚣，在日内瓦会议关于朝鲜问题的讨论结束以后，更加猖狂起来了。在日内瓦会议关于朝鲜问题的讨论结束后的第二天，南朝鲜李承晚匪帮的代表就发表了一个声明，扬言“没有义务再遵守朝鲜停战协定”。南朝鲜傀儡政府叫嚣要任意行动，选择时机“北进”。
    朝鲜人民和全世界爱好和平的人民将绝不容许李承晚匪帮的这种挑衅行动。
    在日内瓦会议关于朝鲜问题讨论的最后一次会议上，苏联外长莫洛托夫提出建议，认为到朝鲜问题在民主基础上得以和平解决从而实现朝鲜的统一时为止，朝鲜和平应不受威胁。他的建议如下：
      “参加日内瓦会议的各国业已同意：在等待朝鲜问题在建立一个统一、独立、民主国家的基础上最后解决期间，不得采取任何可能足以对维持朝鲜和平构成威胁的行动。
    与会者表示相信，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和大韩民国将为了和平的利益依照本宣言而行动。”
    和平的敌人甚至对苏联代表团关于维护朝鲜的和平和保证朝鲜的和平发展从而对维护远东和世界和平作出贡献的建议的讨论都加以拒绝了。根据美国和它的追随者使日内瓦会议关于和平解决朝鲜问题的讨论不能达成任何协议而露骨地表示了企图破坏会议进行的情况，为了使参加会议的各国今后能够继续为和平解决朝鲜问题而努力，中华人民共和国外交部部长周恩来提出了如下的建议：
    “日内瓦与会国家达成协议，它们将继续努力以期在建立统一、独立和民主的朝鲜国家的基础上达成和平解决朝鲜问题的协议。
    关于恢复适当谈判的时间和地点问题，将由有关国家另行商定。”
    阻碍朝鲜的和平统一的人们，连中华人民共和国代表团的这一建议都加以拒绝了。他们的这种行动只不过是更加彻底地暴露了他们是抱着什么目的而来日内瓦的。
    在联合国的旗帜下，参加侵略朝鲜战争的国家的代表们，在美国代表的压力下在会议上宣读了所谓十六国共同宣言。
    他们就这样片面地宣布了停止日内瓦会议关于和平解决朝鲜问题的讨论。
    美国代表和它的追随者们，在会议上拒绝朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、苏联和中华人民共和国代表团所提出的一系列的建议，而陷入提不出自己的建议和找不到任何反对的论据的困难处境时，宣读了事先已经写好带来的所谓宣言。
    在所谓十六国共同宣言中，不仅找不到在民主的基础上和平解决朝鲜问题的任何迹象，而且搬出了早已完全破产了的联合国决议，企图为美国干涉者阻挠朝鲜问题和平解决的罪行进行辩护。
    在会议上宣读的所谓十六国宣言，只不过更加明白地在全世界人民面前表明了作成这个宣言的人们疯狂地反对和平解决朝鲜问题的事实而已。
      （三）
    根据以上所述，可以得出一定的结论。
    会议的整个过程，更加彻底地暴露了美国统治集团和它的追随者们不愿意缓和国际紧张局势，在继续横暴地阻挠着朝鲜问题的和平解决。美国统治集团在日内瓦会议上证实了：它仍然拒绝承认在亚洲人民的历史发展上的划时代的转变，企图继续保持在亚洲已经从根本上崩溃了的陈腐的帝国主义殖民制度，并为此而庇护在各处作为人民的敌人受人唾弃的一小撮反动派。尤其是：它不接受从在反对朝鲜人民的侵略战争中所遭受的惨重的失败中应记取的教训。
    通过日内瓦会议关于和平解决朝鲜问题的讨论，进一步清楚地暴露了今天美国统治集团不仅是渴望和平统一祖国的朝鲜人民的敌人，而且是远东和全世界爱好和平的全体人民的敌人。
    全世界人民进一步清楚地认识到：苏联、中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府为朝鲜的和平和在民主基础上达成朝鲜的和平统一，为缓和国际紧张局势而进行着坚韧的和坚定的斗争的立场，是完全符合于朝鲜人民和全世界爱好和平人民的利益的。
    在日内瓦会议上，伟大的苏联和中华人民共和国的代表团，完全为了维护朝鲜人民的民族利益，为了给朝鲜人民创造条件以便由朝鲜人民自己以和平的方法使朝鲜早日统一成为独立、民主的国家，为了朝鲜人民的和平发展，作了最大的努力。
    苏联、中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的代表团，克服了由于反对和平解决朝鲜问题的人们的一切挑衅行为和拖延政策而造成的复杂性和种种困难，为推动会议前进而作了不倦的努力。
    日内瓦会议由于美国统治集团和它的追随者们的阴谋破坏，没有能够完成赋予它的和平解决朝鲜问题的任务。
    尽管如此，我们应当认为：日内瓦会议关于和平解决朝鲜问题的讨论，已取得了一定的成果。
    不论是解决和朝鲜人民利益有关的任何问题的国际会议，如果没有我国的代表参加，是不可能解决问题的。正因为如此，参加会议的各国代表们，不得不慎重地考虑以有关的问题的主人的资格和其他国家代表以同等地位参加会议的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表团的建议和发言。特别是中华人民共和国以五大国之一的资格参加国际会议的事实，不仅对今后国际关系的发展有着重大的意义，而且打开了公正解决国际争端以及和维护世界和平、特别是亚洲和平有关的问题的可能性。
    如同这次在日内瓦召开的国际会议所表明的一样，今天要解决世界上的任何问题，特别是和亚洲人民的民族利益和维护和平有关的问题，如果没有伟大的中华人民共和国的参加，是不可能的。
      朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、苏联和中华人民共和国的完全符合朝鲜人民的自主权和民族利益的立场，在全世界人民面前再一次明白地表明了，这是始终如一地为实现朝鲜的和平统一的正当立场。与此相反，美国统治集团和追随它的南朝鲜及一些西方代表们的主张，更进一步清楚地在全世界人民面前暴露了他们不愿意和平解决朝鲜问题并继续维持美国对朝鲜的殖民政策的企图。
    尽管在民主的基础上为和平解决朝鲜问题而进行的讨论中，对于原则问题相互间仍有着严重的意见分歧，但是，从日内瓦会议的过程中证明了，对某些基本问题的讨论是存在着能够相互达成协议的可能性的。
    朝鲜的统一问题，今后仍需继续努力，以协商的方法进行谈判来求得解决。
    我们确信：渴望祖国和平统一的全体朝鲜人民的一致愿望和坚决的斗争，受着全世界爱好和平的人民的声援，将除掉南北朝鲜之间的暂时性的障壁。必将以相互接近和相互协商的方法寻求到统一我们祖国的可能性。
      企图把朝鲜再一次拖进战争火海的美国统治集团和南朝鲜的追随者们的军事冒险政策，在南北朝鲜全体人民的坚决斗争和全世界爱好和平人民的反对下，必将遭到粉碎，并且必须予以粉碎。
    朝鲜必须由停战状态转入和平状态，必须在民主的基础上达到和平统一。
    这是热爱祖国的朝鲜人民的一致要求，是热爱远东和世界和平的一切人民的一致愿望。朝鲜人民正在一致奋起进行为恢复和发展因战争而遭受破坏的人民经济的斗争。
    朝鲜人民为加强民主基地的斗争，将成为实现和平统一祖国的物质基础，并促进其实现。伟大的苏联、中国人民和各人民民主国家的人民站在为祖国的和平统一而斗争着的朝鲜人民一边，全世界爱好和平的人民都在支持和声援我们。
    朝鲜人民的坚决斗争将扫除摆在祖国的和平统一的前进道路上的一切障碍，我们的祖国必将和平统一。
