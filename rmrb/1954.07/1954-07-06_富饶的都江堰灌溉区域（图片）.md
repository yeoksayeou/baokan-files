    The Fertile Irrigation Area of Dujiangyan
    The Dujiangyan irrigation area in Sichuan Province is a rich and beautiful place, where, in addition to rice, wheat, rapeseed, tobacco, and other products are abundant. This year, under the principle of combining irrigation and flood control, the People's Government has strengthened the annual maintenance project of Dujiangyan. The water flows through thousands of canals, irrigating more than three million mu of farmland in fifteen counties and cities, enabling agricultural production to proceed smoothly.

    The Dujiangyan project divides the Minjiang River into the inner and outer rivers in Guanxian County, irrigating more than three million mu of fertile farmland in fifteen counties and cities along the banks. This is the scene of the Minjiang River flowing to the Anlan Suspension Bridge in Baiyi Township, Guanxian County, and dividing into the inner and outer rivers flowing downstream.
    Spider-web-like canals are crisscrossed in the fields. Farmers can use water for irrigation in a timely manner.
    Pixian County in the Dujiangyan irrigation area produces a large amount of tobacco leaves every year, which are sold to Shanghai, Hankou, Xikang and other places. This is a picture of members of the Yemaolin mutual aid team in Qinghe Township, Pixian County harvesting tobacco leaves.
    Years of bumper harvests have improved the lives of farmers, and the markets and towns along the Dujiangyan have also become more prosperous day by day. These young peasant women are shopping for printed cloth in a department store in Guanxian County.

    富饶的都江堰灌溉区域
    四川省都江堰灌溉区域是一块富饶美丽的地方，那儿除盛产水稻外，还出产小麦、菜籽、烟叶等多种物产。今年，人民政府在灌溉和防洪相结合的方针下加强了都江堰的岁修工程。水流经过数千条渠道，灌溉着十五个县、市的三百多万亩农田，使农业生产得以顺利进行。

    都江堰工程在灌县分岷江成内外两江，灌溉着沿岸的十五个县、市的三百多万亩肥沃的农田。这是岷江的水流到灌县白沂乡安澜索桥下，分为内江和外江流向下游的情形。
    像蜘蛛网般的渠道，纵横交错地分布在田间。农民们可及时用水灌溉。
    都江堰灌溉区域的郫县，每年出产大量的烟叶，运销上海、汉口、西康等地。这是郫县庆合乡叶茂林互助组的组员正在收烟叶。
    连年的丰收改善了农民的生活，都江堰沿岸的集、镇也跟着一天比一天地繁盛起来。这些年轻的农妇正在灌县的百货商店里选购花布。
