    At a Reception Held at Our Embassy in Our Country
    Prime Minister Grotewohl's Speech

    Dear Premier Comrade, Dear Friends and Comrades!
    The moment of your departure is drawing near. Tomorrow you will already be on the plane, flying to Warsaw to visit our Polish friends. Your trip is a trip of peace. Your stay in the German Democratic Republic for these few days has helped to strengthen and victoriously further develop the cause of European security and peace. The arrival of our friend, Vice Premier Pham Van Dong of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, also contributes to the same goal.
    We take this opportunity to once again express our gratitude to friends Zhou Enlai and Pham Van Dong for their expressions of friendship towards the German Democratic Republic and all peace-loving German people. Comrade Zhou Enlai, you must have felt that the hearts of the German people are drawn to you. You must realize that this warm feeling is also a feeling for the six hundred million Chinese people. Whether it is the children who cheered for you, or our workers who warmly shook your hand; whether it is the thousands of people who cheered for you at our conference yesterday, or the respectable representatives of our scientific community at Humboldt University, you will feel at any time and any place that the friendship between our two peoples is a matter of genuine and deep concern to the German people.
    The political experience that you and Comrade Pham Van Dong have given to the German people is profound and important. The Western war treaties seriously hinder the German people from achieving reunification and concluding a peace treaty. The Bonn and Paris treaties not only mean the re-militarization of West Germany and the ensuing threat of a new war to Germany, but they also mean a serious threat to the security of the whole of Europe, and consequently a serious threat to the security of the whole world.
    With the concern of a true friend, you pointed out that Asian security issues must be handled by the Asian people themselves, and European security issues must be solved by the European people in Europe. We fully agree with your view: the cause of German reunification is a matter for the German people themselves.
    On this day when we conclude our friendly talks, our common great friend—the Soviet Union—made its voice heard to the whole world in the July 24th note on European security issues, bringing a great and happy prospect to all peace-loving people. In this note are written words that shine far and wide and bring new hope to mankind: the Soviet government is always attentive to maintaining peace and international cooperation, and takes all possible measures to achieve these noble goals.
    Today, the Soviet government once again proposed to the world its suggestion on establishing a system of collective security in Europe. The Soviet Union suggests that, in order to exchange views on the issue of establishing a system of collective security in Europe, a conference should be held in the coming months, attended by all European countries willing to participate, as well as the United States of America. The Soviet government believes that it is appropriate for the People's Republic of China to send an observer to this conference.
    In addition, the Soviet government has taken another important step to promote understanding among the peoples of Europe, and has amended its proposal to include a new clause on economic cooperation. This clause stipulates that all countries participating in the treaty must promise to take measures to develop trade and other economic relations between countries, in accordance with the vital interests of the people, and to help consolidate peace and international cooperation.
    The agreement reached in Geneva on July 21 on the issue of Indochina undeniably proves that consultation can achieve results not only in Asia but also in Europe.
    Therefore, the German Democratic Republic wholeheartedly welcomes the Soviet government's proposal, which has opened the way to achieving understanding throughout Europe. An understanding on security issues among European countries will immediately eliminate the obstacles hindering Germans from understanding each other, open the way to German reunification, and make it possible for the occupying forces to completely withdraw from Germany and for a peace treaty with Germany to be concluded in the near future. Therefore, this great peace initiative of the Soviet Union is closely linked to the policy of ensuring the prosperity and happy future of Germany.
    I announce here, in this place where we are gathered with our Chinese and Vietnamese friends, that the German Democratic Republic is prepared to participate in this conference in accordance with the Soviet government's proposal, in order to exchange views on the issue of establishing a system of collective security in Europe, and to present the opinions of the German people and participate in the all-European security treaty at this conference.
    In addition, the government of the German Democratic Republic will spare no effort and do everything in its power to ensure that the Federal Republic of West Germany also participates in this security treaty.
    We are deeply convinced that such a development, as the note says, will indeed be a sincere step to ensure the creation of more favorable conditions for resolving the German question on the basis of establishing a unified Germany, making it a peace-loving, independent, and democratic country. The neutralization of Germany will eliminate the resurgence of a hotbed of war in the heart of Europe. In this way, Germany can overcome the threat to its own national existence and to Europe that may arise from the establishment of a West German aggressive army, which will prevent West Germany from participating in a unilateral military bloc, and provide a sincere and open contribution to defending the peace of the whole of Europe.
    Therefore, on your last day of stay in the German Democratic Republic, thanks to the great proposal of the Soviet Union, a new great prospect of peace and our country's happy future is presented before the German Democratic Republic and all peace-loving people.
    Therefore, please allow me to shout:
    Long live the bastion of world peace, the great and powerful Soviet Union!
    Long live the friendship between Germany and China!
    Long live the friendship between the German people and the peoples of Indochina!
    Long live understanding, friendship, and peace among the peoples of the world!

### 在我国大使馆举行的招待会上  格罗提渥总理的演说

    在我国大使馆举行的招待会上
    格罗提渥总理的演说亲爱的总理同志，亲爱的朋友们和同志们！
    您启程的时刻越来越近了。明天您已经坐上了飞机，飞往华沙去访问我们的波兰朋友们。您的旅行是一个和平的旅行。您在德意志民主共和国停留的几天有助于加强和胜利地进一步发展欧洲安全和和平的主张。我们的朋友，越南民主共和国副总理范文同同志的来到也有助于同一个目的。
    我们趁这个机会，再一次地表示感谢周恩来和范文同两位朋友对德意志民主共和国和全体爱好和平的德国人民的友谊的表示。周恩来同志，您一定能感觉到，德国人民的心都为您吸引了。您一定能意识到，这种热烈的感情同时也是对六亿中国人民的感情。不论是向您欢呼的儿童也好，或者是我们的热烈地和您握手的工人也好；不论是在我们昨天的大会上向您欢呼的成千的群众也好，或者是胡包特大学的我们科学界可尊敬的代表也好，您无论在什么时候什么地方都会感觉到我们两国人民之间的友谊是德国人民真正地和深切地关怀的事。
    您和范文同同志给予德国人民的政治经验是深切的和重要的。西方的战争条约严重妨碍德国人民获得重新统一和缔结和约。波恩和巴黎条约不仅意味着西德的重新军国主义化以及随之而来的威胁德国的新战争的危险，它们还意味着对整个欧洲的安全的严重威胁，以及随之而来的对整个世界的安全的严重威胁。
    您抱着一个真正的朋友的关怀态度指出，亚洲安全问题必须由亚洲人民自己来处理，欧洲安全问题必须由欧洲人民在欧洲加以解决。我们完全同意您的看法：德国重新统一的事业是德国人民自己的问题。
    在我们结束我们的友好的会谈的一天，我们共同的伟大朋友——苏联——在七月二十四日关于欧洲安全问题的照会中使全世界听到它的声音，并为一切爱好和平的人民带来一个伟大幸福的前景。在这个照会中，写下了光辉远照并给人类带来新希望的话；苏联政府时刻注意维护和平和国际合作，并采取一切可能的措施来实现这些崇高的目标。
    今天，苏联政府再次向全世界提出关于建立欧洲集体安全体系的建议。苏联建议，为了就建立欧洲集体安全体系的问题交换意见，在今后几个月内举行一个由全欧洲一切愿意参加的国家以及美利坚合众国举行的会议，苏联政府认为，中华人民共和国派一个观察员出席这次会议是合宜的。
    此外，苏联政府采取了另一个促进欧洲各国人民了解的重要步骤，它修改了它的建议，列入了一条关于经济合作的新条款。这一条规定，一切参加条约的国家必须答应采取发展各国贸易和其他经济关系的措施，以符合人民的切身利益，并有助于巩固和平和国际合作。
    七月二十一日在日内瓦达成的关于印度支那问题的协议无容置辩地证明，协商的方式不仅可以在亚洲取得结果，而且也可以在欧洲取得结果。
    因此，德意志民主共和国衷心地欢迎苏联政府这个打开了在整个欧洲取得谅解的道路的建议。欧洲各国在安全问题上取得谅解，就能立刻消除妨碍德国人自己互相谅解的障碍，就能打开德国重新统
  一的道路，就使得有可能使占领军全部撤离德国和在最近的将来缔结对德和约。因此，苏联这个伟大的和平倡议，是和保证德国的繁荣和幸福前途的政策，有密切联系的。
    我在这里、在我们和中越两国朋友聚会的这个地方宣布：德意志民主共和国准备按照苏联政府的建议参加这个会议，以便就建立欧洲集体安全体系的问题交换意见，并在这个会议上提出德国人民的意见和参加全欧安全条约。
    此外，德意志民主共和国政府将不遗余力并尽一切力量来使得西德联邦共和国也参加这个安全条约。
    我们深信，这样一个发展，正像照会所说，将的确是一个真诚的步骤，以确保创造更为有利的条件，以便在建立一个统一的德国、使之成为一个爱好和平、独立和民主的国家的基础上来解决德国问题。德国的中立化将消除战争的温床在欧洲心脏复活。这样，德国便可克服由于建立西德侵略军而可能产生的对它本身民族存在的威胁和对欧洲的威胁，这将防止西德参加一个单方面的军事集团，而对保卫全欧洲的和平提供真诚的和公开的贡献。
    因此，在您逗留在德意志民主共和国的最后一天，由于苏联的伟大建议，德意志民主共和国和一切爱好和平的人民的前面，呈现了一个新的伟大的和平和我国幸福前途的前景。
    因此，请允许我高呼
    全世界和平的堡垒、伟大的强大的苏联万岁！
    德、中友好万岁！
    德国人民和印度支那各国人民友好万岁！
    全世界各国人民谅解、友好和和平万岁！
                    （新华社柏林二十七日电）
