The People's Government Truly Makes the Best Use of Talent

    Jin Guolu, an old teacher at the Harbin Middle School Teachers' Advanced Studies College, said excitedly to a reporter after studying the Draft Constitution: "This is no simple matter. Although the articles of the Draft Constitution are not many, they encompass such rich content!" He stroked his gray beard and continued:
  "If I had had such a constitution when I was young, my health would not be so bad!"
   He recounted his past experiences: "I was a student in the Mathematics Department of the old Northeast University. At that time, I, like other young people, had wonderful ideals for my future life and work. However, in that society of 'graduation equals unemployment,' not to mention that my wonderful ideals could not be realized, even my livelihood was not guaranteed! I sought help from relatives and friends everywhere, and finally managed to get a position as an elementary school teacher. Although I had studied higher mathematics, I had to teach arithmetic, physical education, drawing, and handicrafts to elementary school students every day. But even this position was not stable. I didn't know how to flatter or bribe, so my position was demoted again and again, and finally the school asked me to 'voluntarily resign.'"
    The old teacher continued indignantly: "I asked myself, my teaching was no worse than anyone else's, and my family of six depended on me alone, how could I 'voluntarily' resign? But what could I do? The pain I felt during those days cannot be described in words. There was no way, I sent my wife and three children back to my hometown, and I supported my other two older children by tutoring middle school students in mathematics. I also ran around everywhere, but I didn't have money to give gifts and didn't want to give gifts, so no one would hire me. I spent nearly ten years like this. My health was ruined by worry at that time."
    The old man was filled with mixed feelings and remained silent for a long time. Then he said: "Harbin was liberated, and the People's Government immediately made me a middle school mathematics teacher. In 1948 and 1951, I was twice selected as an 'Excellent Teacher.' Last October, I was promoted to drafting teacher at the Middle School Teachers' Advanced Studies College. The People's Government has truly made the best use of talent. Only these few years of my life have been the happiest. In the autumn of 1949, my hemorrhoids flared up very badly, and the principal sent me to the hospital. My salary was paid as usual for the first three months, and after three months, he requested a subsidy of 1.2 million yuan from the Education Trade Union on my behalf. This is very common in our country, but for me, who has experienced hardship, it is warmer than a stove in winter."
    The old teacher concluded: "I will study the Draft Constitution carefully, but the fact that citizens of the People's Republic of China have the right to work alone makes me, who suffered the hardship of unemployment in the old society, infinitely happy. How can I not support this constitution, how can I not dedicate all my strength to education!"
    Cultivating Youth for the Nation

    While studying the articles in the Draft Constitution regarding state organs and the basic rights and obligations of citizens, Chen Jiefu, an old teacher at the Nanjing Normal College Affiliated Middle School, was filled with gratitude and could not help but recall the painful situation in the past under reactionary rule when the people had no freedom or security. He has been engaged in education for more than 30 years and has witnessed many instances of young students being persecuted and harmed by reactionaries. Since the May Fourth Movement, all gatherings, parades, and demonstrations by young students have been conducted under the bayonets and bullets of police and soldiers. He remembers that when he was studying at the Oriental University Affiliated Middle School, two students, Wu Zongtian and others, were arrested and beheaded by the warlord Sun Chuanfang in 1927. At that time, there was a risk of persecution for saying even a slightly progressive word. He said: "In the old files of the Nanjing Normal College Affiliated Middle School, there are still many pieces of evidence of reactionaries persecuting progressive teachers and students. Not only was there no democracy or freedom in politics, but there was also no guarantee of labor or work. Many students became unemployed after graduation." On the eve of liberation, he was already sixty-one years old, and he felt very depressed when he thought about what would happen when he could no longer work. But since liberation, the state has been very concerned about the lives of teachers, implementing public medical care, subsidies for multiple children, vacation and recuperation, and other measures. Now, the Draft Constitution clearly stipulates the right of workers to rest and the right to obtain material assistance when they are old and lose their ability to work. Therefore, he no longer worries about living problems. Last year, he was also elected as a people's representative of the Fifth District of Nanjing. From his personal experience, he deeply realized that the Draft Constitution will be the great charter of the people. He is determined to do his best to cultivate youth for the country.
    Teachers Receive the Care of the State

    Li Yanzhen, Vice Principal of Chengde Normal School in Rehe, has been engaged in education for 20 years. In these 20 years, he has personally experienced the superiority of the people's democratic system, and at the same time, he has a clearer understanding of the darkness and corruption of the old society. When he was a student, he was under the bloody white terror of the Kuomintang reactionaries. Many students and teachers who pursued truth and justice were arrested or killed for no reason. Even their lives were not guaranteed, let alone other rights. He was forced to lose his job for reading progressive books at that time, so he could not even maintain his minimum standard of living.
    In 1938, Li Yanzhen began to engage in education in the guerrilla area. For more than ten years, under the cultivation and care of the Communist Party and the People's Government, he gained a new life and enjoyed various rights. This year, he was elected as a people's representative, participated in the Chengde Municipal People's Congress, and also participated in the Chengde Municipal Constitution Draft Discussion Committee. He deeply felt that it was a blessing to be born in New China. At the same time, he personally witnessed the vigorous development of the people's cultural and educational undertakings along with the development of the national economy. In 1949, there were only 406 students in Chengde Normal School, but by 1952, it had grown to more than 1,200. A total of more than 1,100 graduates from Chengde Normal School have been assigned to counties and banners in Rehe Province to engage in education. Under the enthusiastic cultivation of the Communist Party and the People's Government, many of them have been promoted to principals or deans of teaching affairs; some have been selected as excellent teachers. These facts powerfully prove that teachers are valued by the People's Government and the new society, and are loved by the broad masses of the people.
    Li Yanzhen said: "Our Constitution will guarantee the people's freedom and rights. It is the people's constitution, and it fully reflects the superiority of the people's democratic system. We must further improve our policy and ideological level and socialist consciousness, actively learn from the advanced teaching experience of the Soviet Union, and improve our labor enthusiasm and teaching quality."
    Changed the Idea of "Rather Have Two Bushels of Grain Than Be a Teacher"

    Xun Yi, an advanced education worker at the Shenyang Railway No. 1 Primary School, deeply feels the happiness of living in the People's China!
    Education was regarded as a low occupation in the old society. People often said, "Rather have two bushels of grain than be a teacher." Xun Yi left education work because of family obstruction. In October 1951, after he returned to the education post, the situation he encountered was completely different. People called him a people's teacher. The school leaders specifically guided him, and the comrades patiently helped him, so that he quickly became familiar with the business. Because of his achievements in his work, the Shenyang Branch of the Harbin Railway Administration awarded him the title of outstanding teacher three times in a row. In June of this year, he also had the honor of participating in the Shenyang Municipal Congress of Representatives of Advanced Workers in Culture, Education, and Health as an advanced education worker and received a reward from the Shenyang Municipal People's Government.
    Another point that made Xun Yi very excited was that the Draft Constitution stipulates that citizens have the right to education. In the old society, only the children of landlords and capitalists had this right, but the children of the working people did not. At that time, his aunt was a poor peasant, and none of her eight children went to school. It was different after liberation. His aunt's eldest son had a job, and the younger ones all went to school. Now, there are 48 students in the class he teaches, most of whom are the children of railway workers.
    With the development of economic construction, cultural and educational undertakings will also develop. Thinking of this, Xun Yi loves education work even more. He is determined to continue to improve his awareness, study his profession, and strive to cultivate well-rounded socialist newcomers.

### 进一步学习、宣传和讨论宪法草案

专栏：

    进一步学习、宣传和讨论宪法草案
    人民政府真是做到了人尽其才
    哈尔滨中学教员进修学院的老教师金国录在学习宪法草案后很激动地对记者说：“这可不简单，宪法草案的条文虽然不多，可是包括了多么丰富的内容啊！”他一边拈着他的花白胡子一边继续说：
  “如果我年青的时候也有这样的宪法，我的身体就不至于这样坏了！”
   他叙说过去的遭遇：“我是旧东北大学数学系的学生。当时我也和别的年青人一样，对将来的生活和工作有着美妙的理想。但是，在那个‘毕业就是失业’的社会里，不用说美妙的理想不能实现，连生活也没有保障！我到处求亲告友，好容易才弄到一个小学教员的位置。虽然我学过高等数学，却不得不每天给小学生教算术、体育、图画和手工。可是，连这个位置也不是安稳的。我不会奉承，不会贿赂，因此职位一降再降，最后学校里竟叫我‘自愿退职’。”
    老教师愤慨地接着说：“扪心自问，我教学生并不比谁差，家里有六口人靠我一人养活，我何尝
  ‘自愿’辞职呢？可是又有什么办法呢？那些日子我的痛苦不是笔墨所能形容的。没有办法，我把老伴和三个孩子送回老家，我自己靠给中学生补习数学养活我另外两个大孩子。我也曾经到处奔走，但是没钱送礼也不愿送礼，所以哪里也不用我。我就这样度过了将近十年的时光。我的身体就是那时候忧愁坏了的。”
    老人百感交集，沉默了好久，然后又说：“哈尔滨解放了，人民政府立刻让我做中学数学教员，一九四八年、一九五一年两次评选我为‘优秀教师’，去年十月，又提升我为中学教员进修学院的制图教师。人民政府真是做到了‘人尽其才’。我一生中只有这几年是最快乐的日子。一九四九年秋，痔疮闹得很厉害，校长把我送到医院，头三个月工薪照支，三个月后又替我从教育工会请求了一百二十万元的补助费。这在我们国家里本来是很普通的事，但对我这个经历过苦难的人说来，那可比冬天的火炉更温暖。”
    老教师最后说：“我还要仔细研读宪法草案，但是就中华人民共和国公民有劳动的权利这一点来说，便使我这个在旧社会中饱经失业苦难的人无限欢喜了。我怎能不拥护这个宪法，怎能不拿出所有力量从事教育工作呢！”
    为国家培育青年
    南京师范学院附中老教师陈杰夫在学习宪法草案中关于国家机构和公民的基本权利和义务的各项条文时，他心里充满着感激，不由地回想到过去反动统治时代人民毫无自由保障的痛苦情景。他从事教育工作已经三十多年，曾经耳闻目睹过多少青年学生遭受反动派摧残迫害的事实。从“五四”运动起，凡是青年学生的集会、游行示威，无不都是在警察、宪兵的刺刀、枪弹下进行的。他记得他在东方大学附中学习时，学生吴宗田等两人就是一九二七年被军阀孙传芳逮捕砍杀的。那时只要稍微说一句进步的话就有遭到迫害的危险。他说：“在南京师范学院附中的旧卷宗里现在还能找出很多反动派迫害进步师生的罪证。不但政治上得不到民主和自由，而且劳动、工作也没有保障，很多学生毕业后就变成失业者。”解放前夕他已经六十一岁，想到一旦不能工作时，心里非常苦闷。但是解放以来，国家非常关怀教师的生活，实行了公费医疗、多子女补助金、假期休养等等办法。现在宪法草案更明确规定了劳动者的休息权和年老丧失劳动能力时有获得物质帮助的权利。因此他再不忧虑生活问题了。去年他又被选为南京市第五区的人民代表，从切身体会中，他深深地认识到，宪法草案将是人民的大宪章。他决心尽自己的力量更好地为国家培育青年。
    教师受到国家的关心
    热河承德师范学校副校长李彦珍从事教育工作已经二十年了。在这二十年的过程中，他亲身体验到人民民主制度的优越性，同时也更清楚地认识到旧社会的黑暗腐朽。他做学生时正处在国民党反动派血腥的白色恐怖下，许多追求真理、正义的学生和教师无故被逮捕或者屠杀，连生命都没有保障，其他权利就更谈不到了。他当时因阅读进步书籍而被迫失业了，因而最低的生活也不能维持。
    一九三八年李彦珍开始在游击区从事教育工作。十多年来，在共产党和人民政府的培养、关怀下，他获得了新的生命，享受着各种权利。今年他当选为人民代表，参加了承德市人民代表大会会议，又参加了承德市宪法草案讨论委员会，他深深感觉到生长在新中国是幸福的。同时他亲眼看到人民的文化教育事业随着国民经济的发展也蓬勃地发展起来。一九四九年，承德师范学校学生只有四百零六人，到一九五二年就发展到一千二百多人。承德师范学校毕业生共一千一百余人，他们被分配到热河省各县旗从事教育工作。他们在共产党和人民政府的热心培育下，有很多人被提升为校长或教导主任；有的被选为优秀教师。这些事实都有力地证明了教师是被人民政府和新社会器重的，受到广大人民爱戴的。
    李彦珍说：“我们的宪法将保障人民的自由权利，它是人民的宪法，它充分反映了人民民主制度的优越性。我们要更进一步提高政策思想水平及社会主义觉悟，积极学习苏联先进的教学经验，提高劳动热情和教学质量。”
    改变了“家有二斗粮，不当孩子王”的思想
    沈阳铁路第一小学先进教育工作者荀毅，深深感到生活在人民中国的幸福！
    教育工作，在旧社会里被人们视作一种低下的职业。人们常说：“家有二斗粮，不当孩子王。”荀毅就因为家庭的阻挠离开教育工作。一九五一年十月，他重新踏上教育工作岗位之后，所遇到的情况就完全两样了。人们称他为人民教师。学校领导方面具体地指导他，同志们耐心地帮助他，使他很快就熟悉了业务。因他在工作上有成绩，哈尔滨铁路管理局沈阳分局一连三次奖给他以优秀教师的称号。今年六月，他又作为一个先进教育工作者，荣幸地参加沈阳市文化教育卫生先进工作者代表大会，受到沈阳市人民政府的奖励。
    使荀毅十分兴奋的另一点，是宪法草案规定公民有受教育的权利。在旧社会，只有地主、资本家的子女，才有这种权利，劳动人民的子女是没有的。那时他姑姑是贫农，八个儿女都没上学。解放后就不同了。他姑姑的大儿子有了工作做，小的一个个都上学校念书了。现在他教的一班共有四十八个学生，多数是铁路工人的子女。
    随着经济建设事业的发展，文化教育事业也将向前发展。想到这里，荀毅更热爱教育工作。他决心继续提高觉悟，钻研业务，为培养全面发展的社会主义新人而奋斗。
