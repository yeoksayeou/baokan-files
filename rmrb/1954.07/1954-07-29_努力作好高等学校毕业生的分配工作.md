Strive to Do a Good Job in the Allocation of College Graduates

　　The unified allocation of college graduates across the country for the summer of 1954 is about to begin comprehensively. According to the needs of the state, it is a very arduous and meticulous ideological and organizational task to allocate graduates to various positions in national construction in a planned way.

　　This year’s summer allocation plan for college graduates is formulated according to the requirements of the state’s general task during the transition period and the basic tasks of the first Five-Year Plan, following the allocation guidelines of "centralized use, key allocation" and the principle of "integration of learning and application." The focus of allocation remains on industrial construction, primarily considering the needs of 141 projects and related engineering and production. Appropriate arrangements have also been made for college teaching assistants, graduate students, and research interns at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. At the same time, some graduates will be allocated to appropriately address the needs of transportation, agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, finance, and economics departments. As for graduates in agriculture, forestry, teacher training, political science and law, and arts, according to the principle of "local allocation, central adjustment," they will be mainly allocated to various regions, with appropriate adjustments made for graduates in certain departments where supply and demand are significantly disparate between regions. Some graduates will also be transferred to address the needs of college teaching assistants, graduate students, research interns at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and teachers at secondary vocational schools supervised by central business departments. In addition, the planning in this year's allocation of college graduates has been strengthened compared to previous years. For example, the allocation of graduates in major engineering departments is considered based on the work tasks of various industrial departments, the quotas of technical personnel required to complete certain tasks in different industrial sectors, and the growth rate of work tasks in 1955 compared to this year. For college teaching assistants and secondary school teachers, arrangements are considered based on a certain ratio of teachers to students and the enrollment plan for 1955, combined with practical possibilities. This is reasonable under the current circumstances.

　　The college graduate allocation plan is part of the overall national construction plan, and its success or failure will directly affect the national construction plan. Therefore, local personnel departments and colleges should do a good job in specific deployment work in accordance with the requirements of the national allocation plan. Attention must be paid to preventing the phenomenon of simply pursuing the figures of deployment tasks, working without thoroughness, lacking in-depth understanding of the graduates' situations, and lacking appropriate consideration for the actual difficulties of certain graduates. Provincial (municipal) personnel departments should not completely push the work of deployment and dispatch of graduates to the colleges and universities, and must be practically responsible for reviewing the deployment plans formulated by the colleges and universities. Each college must also prevent the phenomenon of departmentalism in the allocation work. Every graduate should, based on the requirements of the state's general task during the transition period, obey the national allocation plan and the needs of all aspects of national construction. Only when every graduate can consciously obey the needs of the work and accept the work assigned by the state, is it possible to complete the national allocation plan. It must be recognized that because we have made industrial construction the focus of allocation, more graduates are being transferred out of various regions, the transfers between regions are more complicated, and some graduates' personal difficulties may not be resolved temporarily; at the same time, because there is still a certain distance between the professional settings and teaching content of our country's colleges and universities and the needs of the state, and there is still an imbalance between the number of graduates in each department and the actual needs, the professional knowledge learned by some graduates is not fully in line with the requirements of the current work. Therefore, the work of a small number of graduates can only be appropriately arranged according to the needs of the work and their specific circumstances, and they can only be assigned to work with similar nature to the departments and majors they have studied. This requires graduates to fully understand and obey the needs of national construction.

　　This year, college graduates have further improved their political awareness after studying the state's general task during the transition period, and they have a high enthusiasm for participating in the construction of the motherland. They can generally obey the state's allocation and happily take up their posts. However, some graduates still have various ideas, such as only wanting to participate in industrial construction work, and belittling education and other work; only wanting to go to large-scale basic construction units, and not wanting to go to ordinary units; or over-considering personal interests and life, and not wanting to go to remote and desolate areas, and not wanting to do more arduous work, etc. But we firmly believe that as long as they proceed from the overall interests of the country and have the spirit of wholeheartedly serving the people and the motherland, they will be able to meet any arduous work and so-called ordinary work with a fighting attitude.

　　In the current situation where the supply of construction talents falls short of demand, how each unit correctly uses graduates, cultivates and improves them, and gives full play to their role in various construction tasks after they arrive at their work units according to the national allocation plan is a very important issue.

　　Each employing unit should carefully and meticulously consider placing graduates in appropriate positions and using them correctly based on their actual situation. It must be pointed out that the phenomenon of wasting talent in the graduate allocation work still exists in some units. Some units, due to unfamiliarity with the business and not studying the use of graduates' departments very well, have made it impossible for a few graduates to integrate learning with application. There are also units that deviate from actual needs and blindly allocate graduates' work, which has even led to the phenomenon of overstaffing, and even made students unnecessarily change their careers and do other work. This urgently needs to be corrected. At the same time, each unit should care about the political and professional training and improvement of graduates in order to further consolidate their work enthusiasm. After graduates arrive at their posts, what they care about most is that they can continuously improve politically and quickly become familiar with and improve professionally. Employing units should conscientiously introduce the situation of the unit to graduates to dispel any concerns they may have; for units with internships, they should attach importance to the leadership of graduates during the internship period, so that they can familiarize themselves with the work more quickly during the internship and gradually combine the knowledge in books with practical work. After graduates arrive at their posts, they generally work actively and enthusiastically, but they are new to the school, and their views on many practical problems are often one-sided. There may also be many problems in the thinking of a small number of graduates. This requires employing units to conduct patient persuasion and education, rather than taking simple and crude methods. Each department should also proactively and systematically check the use of graduates within its department system, and if the work assigned to graduates is inappropriate, it should be reasonably adjusted to give more effective play to their enthusiasm.

　　The unified allocation of college graduates is a work of great political significance. We sincerely hope that the personnel departments, colleges and universities, and relevant departments in various places can earnestly take responsibility and act cautiously; we also ask the graduates to assist the government in successfully completing the allocation work.

### 努力作好高等学校毕业生的分配工作

    努力作好高等学校毕业生的分配工作
    一九五四年暑期全国高等学校毕业生统一分配工作即将全面开始，按照国家需要，有计划地把毕业生分配到国家建设的各种岗位上去，这是一件十分艰巨而又细致的思想工作和组织工作。
    今年暑期全国高等学校毕业生的分配方案，是根据国家在过渡时期的总任务和第一个五年计划的基本任务的要求，按照“集中使用、重点分配”的分配方针和“学用一致”原则来制订的。分配重点仍是工业建设，首先考虑一百四十一项工程及其有关的工程和生产的需要。对于高等学校的助教、研究生及中国科学院研究实习员，也作了适当配备。同时要分配部分毕业生适当解决交通运输、农林、水利、财经等部门的需要。至于农林、师范、政法、艺术四类毕业生，按照“地方分配、中央调剂”的原则，主要分配给各地区，对地区间某些供求悬殊的系科毕业生则作适当调剂，并抽调部分毕业生解决高等学校助教、研究生、中国科学院研究实习员和中央业务部门主管的中等专业学校教员的需要。此外，在今年高等学校毕业生的分配上，计划性也较历届加强了。如工科类主要系科毕业生的分配，是根据各工业部门的工作任务及不同产业部门完成一定工作所需技术人员的定额，以及一九五五年工作任务较今年增长的速度等条件来考虑的。对于高等学校的助教及中等学校的教员，则根据一定的教员及学生的比例及一九五五年招生计划，结合实际可能来考虑配备。这在目前情况下是合理的。
    高等学校毕业生分配计划是整个国家建设计划中的一部分，完成的好坏将直接影响国家建设计划。因此，各地人事部门、高等学校应该按照国家分配计划的要求，作好具体的调配工作。单纯追求调配任务的数字，工作不细致，对于毕业生的情况了解不深入，对某些毕业生的实际困难缺乏适当照顾的现象必须注意防止。省（市）人事部门，不应把毕业生的调配、派遣等工作完全推给各高等学校，对高等学校所拟订的调配计划必须切实负责加以审查。各高等学校还必须防止在调配工作中的本位主义的现象发生。每个毕业生则应该根据国家过渡时期总任务的要求，服从国家分配计划，服从国家各方面建设的需要。每个毕业生都能自觉地服从工作的需要，接受国家分配的工作，国家分配计划才有可能完成。必须看到由于我们把工业建设作为配备重点，各地区调出的毕业生较多，地区之间调动也较复杂，也可能有某些毕业生的个人困难暂时不能得到解决；同时，由于目前我国高等学校的专业设置及教学内容和国家需要之间，还存在着一定的距离，各系科毕业生的人数和实际需要之间还存在着不均衡的现象，部分毕业生所学的专业知识还不完全符合目前工作的要求，因此，可能有少数毕业生的工作只能根据工作需要和他们的具体情况来适当安排，只能分配他们去作和所学系科、专业性质相近的工作。这就要求毕业生能全面地认识并服从国家建设的需要。
    今年高等学校毕业生在学习了国家过渡时期的总任务以后，政治觉悟已进一步提高了，对参加祖国建设有着很高的热情，一般能够作到服从国家分配，愉快地走上工作岗位。但也有些毕业生还存在着各种各样的想法，如只愿参加工业建设工作，轻视教育工作及其他工作；只愿到规模大的基本建设单位，不愿到普通的单位；或过多地考虑个人的兴趣和生活，不愿到边远、荒僻的地区，不愿作较艰苦的工作等等。但我们深信，他们只要从国家整体利益出发，有全心全意为人民为祖国服务的精神，就一定能够以战斗的姿态去迎接任何艰苦的工作和所谓平凡的工作的。
    在目前建设人才供不应求的情况下，毕业生按照国家分配计划到达工作单位以后，各单位如何正确地使用他们，培养、提高他们，充分发挥他们在各项建设工作中的作用，是一个非常重要的问题。
  各用人单位应该根据毕业生的实际情况，慎重、细致地考虑把毕业生放在适当的工作岗位上，正确地使用他们。必须指出，某些单位在毕业生分配工作中浪费人才的现象仍然存在着。有些单位由于不熟悉业务，不很好研究毕业生所学系科的用途，曾使少数毕业生学用不能一致。还有的单位脱离实际需要，盲目地分配毕业生的工作，乃至造成人浮于事的现象，甚至使学生不必要的改行作了别的工作。这是迫切需要改正的。各单位同时应该关心毕业生在政治上、业务上的培养和提高，以进一步巩固他们的工作热情。毕业生到达工作岗位后，最关心的是政治上能不断进步，业务上能迅速熟悉和提高。用人单位要认真地对毕业生介绍本单位的情况，解除他们可能发生的顾虑；对有见习期的单位，要重视对毕业生在见习期的领导，使他们在见习期间能较快地熟悉工作，把书本上的知识和实际工作一步步结合起来。毕业生到达工作岗位后，一般均能积极热情地工作，但他们初出学校，对许多实际问题的看法往往是片面的。少数毕业生的思想也可能存在不少问题。这就要求用人单位进行耐心的说服、教育，而不应采取简单、粗暴的办法。各部门还应主动地、有计划地检查本部门系统内毕业生的使用情况，分配毕业生的工作如有不恰当的，应进行合理的调整，更有效地发挥他们的积极性。
    高等学校毕业生统一分配工作，是一件具有重大政治意义的工作。我们深望各地人事部门、高等学校及各有关部门，都能切实负起责任，谨慎从事；也要求毕业同学们协助政府，胜利地完成分配的工作。
