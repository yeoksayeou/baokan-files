    Shortly after China's largest large-scale steel rolling mill and the first seamless steel tube plant were put into production, China's first mechanized automated sheet metal plant was also completed. This is another victory on the road of China's socialist industrialization.

    Sheet metal is one of the steel products that China urgently needs and has the widest range of uses. Let's start with the needs of people's lives. Many of the kettles and buckets used in people's homes are made of sheet metal; enameled washbasins, thermos shells, mugs, lunch boxes, etc., are made of sheet metal; even children's toys are often made of sheet metal. Meeting these needs in people's daily lives is a major issue in the development of the national economy. However, the most urgent need for sheet metal is in various industrial construction, national defense construction, transportation, agriculture and other undertakings. From heavy-duty machine tools and mining, papermaking, and textile equipment produced by the machinery industry to bicycles and various tools and instruments, almost nothing can do without sheet metal. The products of the petroleum and chemical industries must be transported to where they are needed in oil drums or other containers made of sheet metal. The roofs of every newly built factory building also require a large amount of sheet metal. The various transformers used in the power industry also need silicon steel sheets produced by sheet metal plants to manufacture. As for the importance of national defense construction, one can imagine it by just looking at the steel helmet worn by a soldier defending the motherland, the shovel he carries, and his lunch box. Each locomotive, railcar, automobile, and ship in the transportation industry, as well as agricultural machinery such as tractors and harvesters needed by collective farmers, cannot do without sheet metal.

    However, the output, dimensions, and thinness of sheet metal produced in China in the past and at present cannot meet the needs. Before liberation, China had to rely on expensive sheet metal imports from capitalist countries, which directly affected industrial development and the people's economic lives. For example, meat and dairy products in the Inner Mongolia region of China, candies in Guangdong, and seafood in coastal areas are all abundant and cheap, but due to the lack of sheet metal to manufacture canned food containers, people in non-producing areas rarely get to eat them, and exports are also affected.

    The commissioning of the new sheet metal plant will greatly change the situation of sheet metal shortage in China. The amount of sheet metal it produces each year will be much more than the total amount of sheet metal produced in the country last year. Like the large-scale steel rolling mill and seamless steel tube plant newly built with the help of the Soviet Union, this sheet metal plant has a very high output, but it requires very few production personnel, and its labor productivity is more than four times higher than that of the original sheet metal plant.

    The production process of the new sheet metal plant is mechanized and automated. Workers only need to master complex technologies and do not have to do heavy labor during operation. They can produce by pressing buttons or adjusting instruments on dozens of operating tables.

    Now, let's talk about the production process of sheet metal. After electric carts full of long slabs are transported into the factory building, the automatic shearing machine begins to perform the duty of a tailor, cutting the slabs into small pieces and sending them to the heating furnace of the roughing mill. The heating furnace is very good at controlling the temperature of the slab. If it is too hot, it will automatically reduce the amount of gas, and if it is cold, it will increase the amount of gas. After the slab is heated, the heating furnace automatically spits it out onto the roughing mill for rolling. The steel plate rolled out this time is too thick and needs to be rolled further, but at this time its body becomes larger and it must be transported by conveyor belt to the folding machine to be folded into two layers, and then to the heating furnace of the finishing mill for heating, and then rolled again. After that, the steel plate is folded into four layers, heated again, and rolled again. Finally, eight layers of thin sheet metal, as thin as book cover paper, are stretched out from under the rollers. At this time, it has to be stewed in a furnace with only heat and no flame for more than 20 hours - annealing. The repeated heating and rolling of the steel plate makes its body dirty, so it has to go to the pickling pool to take a bath, and then to the dryer to dry. At this time, if the steel plate is not galvanized, it will go to the leveling machine to stretch its body, and after inspection it is considered a finished product. If galvanizing is required, all the sheet metal will be arranged in two teams and simultaneously drilled into the galvanizing machine at a speed of several meters per minute, plating the black skin into a shiny, rust-proof silver-white. After the steel plate is galvanized, its outer skin is not only beautiful, but its lifespan is also three times longer than before.

    我国第一座机械化自动化的薄板厂
    新华社记者　李峰
    在我国最大的大型轧钢厂和第一座无缝钢管厂投入生产不久，我国第一座机械化自动化的薄板厂又建设完成了。这是我国社会主义工业化道路上的又一个胜利。
    薄钢板，是我国目前迫切需要和用途最广泛的钢材之一。先从人们生活的需要说起吧。人们家里用的水壶和水桶等许多是薄钢板做的；洗脸用的搪瓷脸盆、暖水瓶的外壳、口杯、饭盒等等，是用薄钢板做成的；甚至孩子们的玩具，许多也是用薄钢板做成的。满足人们日常生活中的这些需要，是发展国民经济中的一个重大问题。可是，目前最迫切需要薄钢板的地方，还是各种工业建设、国防建设和交通、农业等事业上。从机械工业生产的重型工作母机和矿山、造纸、纺织设备，直到自行车、各种工具仪器等，几乎没有不用薄钢板的。石油和化学工业的产品，必须由薄钢板做成油桶或其他容器，才能运送到需要它的地方。各地新建的每一座工厂的厂房盖，也都需要大量的薄钢板。电力工业所用的各种变压器也需要由薄板厂生产的矽钢片来制造。对于建设国防的重要，只看一个保卫祖国的战士头带的钢盔，身背的铁锹和饭盒等装备就可想一般了。交通运输业中的每个机车、车皮、汽车和轮船，集体农民们需要的拖拉机、收割机等农业机械，那样也是离不开薄钢板的。
    但是，我国过去和现在生产的薄钢板，产量、尺码和薄度都不能满足需要。解放以前，我国不得不依赖资本主义国家昂贵的薄钢板进口，这样就直接影响了工业的发展，影响了人民的经济生活。例如我国内蒙古地区的肉乳类，广东的糖果，沿海的鱼虾等等，出产都很丰富，价钱也很便宜，但由于缺乏薄钢板制造罐头盒等食品容器，所以非产地的广大人民很少吃到，出口也受到了影响。
    新建的薄板厂投入生产后，将大大改变我国缺乏薄钢板的状况。它每年所生产的薄钢板，将比去年全国生产的薄板总量还多得多。这座薄板厂和苏联帮助我国新建的大型轧钢厂和无缝钢管厂一样，产量很高，但它需要的生产人员却很少，劳动生产率比原有的薄板厂高四倍还多。
    新建薄板厂的生产过程，都是机械化自动化的。工人们只要掌握好复杂的技术，操作时不必做笨重的劳动，只分别在几十个操作台上，按动电钮或调整仪表就可以生产。
    现在，让我们讲述一下薄板的生产过程吧。电动的小车满载着长长的板坯运进厂房后，自动剪断机开始执行裁缝的职务，把板坯剪成小块，送到荒轧机的加热炉。加热炉很会掌握板坯的温度，太热了它会自动把瓦斯量减少，冷了它会把瓦斯量增大。板坯烧好了，加热炉又自动把它吐到荒轧机上压延。这次压延出来的钢板因为太厚，还需要继续轧，但这时它的身体变大了，必须坐着运输带到折摺机摺成两层，再到精轧机的加热炉加热，然后再轧。之后，钢板被摺成四层再加热，再轧。最后，像书皮纸样薄的八层薄钢板，就从轧辊底下伸展出来了。这时，它还要到只热而没有火焰的炉子里焖二十多小时——退火。钢板的反复加热和压延，把它的身体弄脏了，因此，它还要到酸洗池子里去洗澡，出来后再到干燥机里去干燥。这时，钢板如果不镀锌，它就到平整机那里舒展舒展身体，经过检查就算成品了。如果需要镀锌，所有的薄钢板就要排成两队，同时以每分钟好多公尺的速度钻进镀锌机里，把黑色的皮肤镀成光润不锈的银白色。钢板镀锌后，它的外皮不仅漂亮了，而且比原来的寿命要延长三倍。
