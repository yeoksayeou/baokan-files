The Party committees and People's Governments at all levels in Hebei Province have actively led farmers in carrying out the struggle against disasters and protecting seedlings, and have achieved preliminary success. In many areas, pest control meetings were held and technicians were trained, and pesticides and machinery were allocated before the outbreak of insect pests. More than 3 million jin of "666" pesticide powder alone were allocated throughout the province, providing strong support for farmers' pest control efforts. Areas affected by insect pests, hailstorms, and floods have all taken necessary measures in a timely manner, actively leading farmers in eliminating pests, replanting crops, and rescuing seedlings. In the struggle against pest control, flood prevention, etc., mutual aid and cooperation organizations have fully demonstrated the superiority of mutual aid and cooperation. Most agricultural producers' cooperatives and mutual aid teams have taken the lead in pest control and other activities, and many agricultural producers' cooperatives and mutual aid teams have actively helped individual farmers who lack labor after finishing their own work by eliminating pests, rushing to plant late-season crops, or lending livestock and farm implements to individual farmers, or providing technical assistance, thereby motivating individual farmers to actively participate in the pest control and flood prevention struggle. From June 21st to 27th, Gaocheng County launched a pest control shock week. Driven by mutual aid and cooperation organizations, farmers throughout the county participated in aphid control, and the aphids in 340,000 mu of cotton fields were treated again. In Jin County, driven by mutual aid and cooperation organizations, 100,000 farmers invested in the pest control and seedling protection struggle. Currently, the cotton fields in the major cotton-producing areas have generally been treated for aphids two or three times. After continuous treatment, the cotton seedlings have grown two to four new leaves and four to five fruit branches, and are blooming and budding. In terms of locust control, the general areas have conscientiously implemented the policy of "chemical control as the mainstay." Most of the relatively concentrated locust nymphs have been eliminated in the early-stage, localized areas. Crops destroyed by hail have generally been replanted or converted to other crops in a timely manner.

    河北省广大农民抗灾保苗获得初步成绩
    河北省各级党委和人民政府积极领导农民开展抗灾保苗斗争，并获得初步成绩。有不少地区在虫害发生以前，就召开了除虫会议，组织训练技术员，调拨除虫药械。光“六六六”药粉，全省就拨发了三百多万斤，有力地支持了农民的除虫斗争。遭受虫害、雹灾、涝灾的地区，都及时采取了必要的措施，积极领导农民除治害虫、补种作物、抢救禾苗。在除虫、防涝等斗争中，各地互助合作组织充分发挥了互助合作的优越性。大部分农业生产合作社、互助组在除虫等活动中走在前头，并有不少农业生产合作社、互助组在做完了本社本组的活计以后，主动帮助缺乏劳动力的单干农民除虫、抢种晚田，或把牲口、农具借给单干农民用，或从技术上帮助，因而带动单干农民积极参加了除虫、防涝斗争。藁城县从六月二十一日到二十七日，开展了除虫突击周，在互助合作组织的带动下，全县农民参加了除蚜，三十四万亩棉田的蚜虫又普治了一遍。晋县在互助合作组织的带动下，十万农民投入除虫保苗斗争。现在各主要棉区的棉田蚜虫，一般已普治两、三遍。经过连续除治的棉苗，已长出两个到四个新叶和四、五个果枝，正在开花、孕蕾。在除蝗方面，一般地区都认真贯彻了“药剂除治为主”的方针，比较集中的蝗蝻，大部都消灭在幼龄点片阶段。被雹子砸毁的作物，一般都做到了及时补种和改种。
