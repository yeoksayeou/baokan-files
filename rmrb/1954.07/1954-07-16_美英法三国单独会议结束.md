Xinhua News Agency, 15th dispatch: According to TASS, French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Mendès France, British Foreign Secretary Eden, and US Secretary of State Dulles, who made a special trip to Paris, began a separate meeting in Paris on the evening of the 13th. The meeting continued late into the night. The three ministers held two more meetings on the 14th, which were apparently not originally scheduled.

Following the meeting, Agence France-Presse broadcast a communiqué stating that the meeting was entirely about Indochina and the United States clarified its position on this issue. As everyone knows, this issue is currently being discussed at the Geneva Conference. The communiqué also stated that Mendès France expressed an opinion, which was endorsed by British Foreign Secretary Eden, that the United States should "send a minister-level representative to the Geneva Conference again."

The US government had originally decided not to send the Secretary of State or his assistant to the Geneva Conference, but the post-meeting communiqué said that President Eisenhower and Dulles "have asked U.S. Undersecretary of State Walter Bedell Smith to return to Geneva in the near future."

The Paris meeting of Mendès France, Eden, and Dulles became the focus of attention for French newspaper commentators on the 14th. From the newspaper comments, it can be seen that Dulles's purpose in coming to Paris was to exert new pressure on France and Britain.

"Le Figaro" wrote that Dulles came to Paris not to inquire about news from Eden and Mendès France, certainly not just to do that. "Le Figaro" emphasized that "it is not difficult to conclude that he came to Paris not only to inquire about news, but also to firmly put forward the conditions that Washington considers necessary for participating in the settlement of the Indochina issue."

"Le Monde" published an article by Mrs. Tabouis, in which the author undisguisedly expressed dissatisfaction, saying: "It can be pointed out that only we can judge what conditions we can accept to achieve a glorious peace. Certain American diplomats and experts do not understand the development of the situation in the Indochina War."

"L'Humanité" believes that Dulles came to Paris to undermine the Geneva negotiations and seek to continue the Indochina War.

The Paris correspondent of the British "Times" wrote that recently, the French domestic indignation and dissatisfaction with American policy has been so obvious that it has become a "serious threat to Western unity."

    美英法三国单独会议结束
   【新华社十五日讯】据塔斯社讯：法国总理兼外交部长孟戴斯—弗朗斯、英国外交大臣艾登和特地到巴黎来的美国国务卿杜勒斯十三日晚在巴黎开始举行单独会议。会议一直进行到深夜。三国部长十四日又举行了两次会议，显然这是原先没有预定的。
    会议结束后，法新社播发了一条会议公报，说会议的内容完全是关于印度支那问题，美国在会上阐明了它在这一问题上的立场。大家知道，这一问题是目前日内瓦会议讨论的内容。公报还说，孟戴斯—弗朗斯发表了为英国外交大臣艾登赞同的意见，即：美国最好是“再次派一个部长一级的人出席日内瓦会议”。
    美国政府原来是决定不派国务卿或他的助手出席日内瓦会议的，然而这次会后公报中说，艾森豪威尔总统和杜勒斯“已要美国副国务卿华尔特·贝得尔·史密斯在最近期内回到日内瓦”。
    孟戴斯—弗朗斯、艾登和杜勒斯的巴黎会议成为法国报纸评论员十四日的注意中心。从报纸的评论可以看出，杜勒斯到巴黎来的目的是要对法英两国施加新的压力。
      “费加罗报”写道，杜勒斯到巴黎来，决不是为了要向艾登和孟戴斯—弗朗斯打听消息，决不是如此而已。“费加罗报”着重指出，“不难断定，他来巴黎不只是为了打听消息，而且是为了坚定地提出华盛顿认为参加解决印度支那问题所必需的条件。”
    “新闻报”刊载了塔布伊夫人的一篇文章，作者不加掩饰地表示不满说：“可以指出，只有我们才能判断什么是我们能接受的实现光荣和平的条件。某些美国外交官和专家是不懂得印度支那战争局势的发展情况的。”
      “人道报”认为，杜勒斯来巴黎，是为了破坏日内瓦谈判，并谋求继续进行印度支那战争。
    英国“泰晤士报”驻巴黎记者写道，最近期间，法国国内对美国政策的愤慨不满是这样明显，以至于成为“西方团结的严重威胁”。
