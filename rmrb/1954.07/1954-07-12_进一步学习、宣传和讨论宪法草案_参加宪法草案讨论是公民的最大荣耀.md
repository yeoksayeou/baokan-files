Further Study, Publicity, and Discussion of the Draft Constitution
Participating in the Discussion of the Draft Constitution is the Greatest Honor for Citizens
Personally Discussing the Fundamental Law of the State is the People's Greatest Happiness
On the afternoon of June 25th, the Sanlieshi Street Office in the Wuchang District of Wuhan City convened eleven street-level mass cadres for a discussion meeting on the draft constitution.

The first to speak was Huang Yuxian, the deputy director of the Wenchangmen Zhengjie Residents' Committee. She is fifty-six years old this year. When she is mentioned, her neighbors know that she lost her parents at the age of eight and has been wandering ever since. When she talked about the draft constitution, she said, "I never thought that when I was in my fifties, I would be able to work for the masses in the streets, speak freely at meetings large and small, and even participate in the discussion of the fundamental law of the country. I am so happy that I don't know where to start." She paused for a moment, then said, "In the past, no one took care of the elderly laborers, but now it is different. The draft constitution stipulates that laborers can enjoy the help of the state when they are old. This should be the greatest happiness for us working people." Xu Defu, the head of the Jiefanglu South Section Residents' Committee, used to repair bicycles. He said, "In the old society, it was very difficult to do this business. Once, a pseudo-police officer swaggered into my shop and asked for a bicycle. I said to him, 'Get a guarantor.' The man glared at me and left. Later, someone told me: 'He is the patrol officer of the police station, don't you know?' I thought, oh, a patrol officer, to hell with him. But after a while, this 'lord' came again, and without asking any questions, he slapped me and left." After telling this painful experience, he continued, "Now, we are closely united with the local people's police. We discuss everything together, whether it is fire prevention or hygiene, they do it themselves. Now the draft constitution explicitly stipulates that all staff members of state organs must be loyal to the people's democratic system, abide by the constitution and laws, and strive to serve the people. This is truly the happiness of the people."

Yu Wenxiu, a family member of a porter, Wei Hao (a Hui Muslim), Ouyang Qinzhang (a Christian), Qian Yunqi (a technician at the Tongtaihou Hotel), Yang Jingzhi (a small businessman), Liu Chunfang, a housewife, and others spoke in succession. In their speeches, each of them, combined with their own personal experiences, recounted the various darknesses of the old society and the various unfortunate lives they had suffered under oppression and bullying; they felt proud and happy about the promulgation of the draft constitution, and everyone proposed guarantees, expressing their intention to support the draft constitution with practical actions. Qian Yunqi said, "Today we have the right to manage state affairs, so we must be good housekeepers and masters. I guarantee to supervise the capitalists, and the processing and ordering of goods must be of good quality and quantity, and completed on time."

The State Cares for Us, We Love the State
On the morning of June 19th, the women of the 15th Residents' Group of Shandong Street in the Fourth District of Tangshan City held a discussion on the draft constitution.

Gong Xiuyun, a working woman who had suffered hardship in the old society, said, "The draft constitution states that the state protects women's rights, which makes me feel unspeakably happy. In the old society, who looked up to women? In 1946, I came to Tangshan City. My husband, Xu Tai, was a temporary worker. If he worked for a day, he had food to eat, but I didn't. After liberation, Xu Tai went to work at the Huaxin Textile Company. The workers became the masters of the country, and their living standards greatly improved. The food and clothing of the whole family have changed for the better, and my own life has also improved. To show my support for the draft constitution, I will definitely ensure that Xu Tai eats well, rests well, and doesn't miss work, and encourage him to actively produce in the factory."

Li Huixian said, "In the old society, we working people couldn't even afford to eat, let alone have the right to education. When I was a child, my mother often said to me: 'Child! Not knowing a word is like being blind.' I never thought that my mother would die of a sudden illness, and I had no hope of going to school. After liberation, my family was allocated land and houses, and we lived a good life. The year before last, I entered a quick literacy class. The draft constitution states that citizens have the right to education. When I saw it, I felt unspeakably happy."

Mei Shuqing is the mother of eleven children, but only four survived. She was deeply moved to hear that the draft constitution stipulates that marriage, family, mothers, and children are protected by the state. She said, "Before liberation, my husband, Zhelin, worked for a day and brought back two pounds of corn flour. I went to pick coal cinders every day, and we were still hungry every few days. I remember when my daughter, Fengying, was one year old, she was sick and had no milk to eat. At that time, Zhelin couldn't bear to eat his fill and left me the noodles to eat so that I could have milk to feed Fengying. Fortunately, we saved the child's life, but she developed a stomach problem. After her, I had seven more children, but none of them survived because of the difficult living conditions and poor sanitation. After liberation, our lives got better. Fengying's stomach problem was cured at the Kailuan Hospital, and now she is in school. Later, the three children I raised, the boy Enjie, and the girls Fenglan and Fengyun, were all delivered using the new method, and now they are all growing up fat. This year, the people's government established health stations for us. Now the state has written the protection of mothers and children into the draft constitution. This is not only the happiness of women, but also the happiness of our future generations. The state cares for us, we must love the state."

Every woman who attended the meeting expressed her feelings. They all agreed that every word of the draft constitution cares about the interests of the people and the interests of women.

We Will Never Be Trampled Upon Again
The Guiyang City Department Store Employees' Union held a discussion meeting on the draft constitution on the afternoon of June 29th.

At the discussion meeting, the store employees showed their heartfelt support and gratitude for the draft constitution.

They talked about how, before liberation, apprentices had to work at least thirteen or fourteen hours a day and had to take care of the boss's wife's baby, wash diapers, and empty chamber pots. And what about the treatment? Generally, they didn't get paid for three years, ate leftovers, wore torn clothes "bestowed" by the boss, and were beaten and scolded. This kind of painful life is no longer seen today. The store employees have their own organization - the union, and their wages have been appropriately increased. Moreover, under the organization and leadership of the union, there are also regular political and professional studies, as well as various cultural and sports activities, which guarantee the intellectual and physical development of the store employees. Compared with the old society, there is a world of difference! Zhou Junqin, a member of the Department Store Employees' Union, said: The draft constitution stipulates that the state pays special attention to the physical and intellectual development of young people. However, in the old society, I was not even twelve years old when I started helping people do heavy work. Li Huizhan, a senior technician at the Kailuo Photo Studio and a member of the photography grassroots trade union, said: Since I became an apprentice at the age of sixteen or seventeen, I have always been unable to escape poverty. I often worry that I will not be able to live when I get old. After liberation, the people's government promulgated the labor insurance regulations. Now, the draft constitution stipulates that laborers can enjoy material assistance from the state when they are old and lose their ability to work. How can this not excite me!

At the discussion meeting, many store employees expressed their intention to support the draft constitution with practical actions. Zhou Junqin said: In the future, I guarantee: to strengthen the study of the draft constitution, to publicize and explain it to the broad masses of the people, especially the store employees; to overcome the shortcomings in my work, and to improve work efficiency; to effectively supervise the capitalists to abide by the state's policies of utilization, restriction, and transformation of capitalist industry and commerce. Many other store employees also expressed their intention to correctly implement the state's policies on capitalist industry and commerce and to resolutely struggle against all illegal acts.

    进一步学习、宣传和讨论宪法草案
    参加宪法草案讨论是公民的最大荣耀
    亲自讨论国家大法是人民最大幸福
    六月二十五日下午，武汉市武昌区三烈士街办事处召集街道群众干部十一人，开了一次宪法草案座谈会。
    第一个发言的是文昌门正街居民委员会副主任委员黄玉仙。她今年五十六岁。提起她来，街邻都知道她八岁上就死了爹娘，以后一直在外流浪。一谈到宪法草案，她说：“我想不到活到五十出头时，能在街道上替群众办事，能在大小会上自由发言，更想不到自己能够亲自参加国家根本大法的讨论，我真高兴得不知道从那儿谈起哩。”她停顿了一下，又说：“从前，劳动者年纪大了那有人照管，现在不同啦，宪法草案上规定劳动者年老时，可以享受国家的帮助，这该是我们劳动人民莫大的幸福呀。”解放路南段居民委员会的负责人徐德富，原来是修理自行车的，他说：“在旧社会里，作这门行当，困难很多，有一次，一个伪警察局的人员大模大样走到我行里要车子，我对他说，取个保吧，这个人死死地瞪了我一眼走了。回头，有人告诉我：‘他是警察局的巡官老爷，难道你不晓得吗？’我想，喔，巡官老爷，管他妈的。但不一会儿，这位老爷又‘光临’了，不问青红皂白，打我一耳光就走了。”他在讲完了这段痛苦的经历后，接着说：“如今呢，我们和地方上的人民警察紧紧打成一片，有事大家商量，防火工作也好，卫生工作也好，他们都是亲自下手干。现在宪法草案又明文规定，一切国家机关工作人员必须效忠人民民主制度，服从宪法和法律，努力为人民服务。这真是人民的幸福。”
    搬运工人家属余文秀、卫生组长魏浩（回民）、欧阳琴章（基督教徒）、居民组长钱运启（同泰厚酒店的技术工人）、居民委员会副主任委员杨敬之（小工商业者）、家庭妇女刘春芳等等相继发言。在发言中，他们各人结合自己的亲身经验，诉说了旧社会的种种黑暗，和自己过去受压迫受欺凌的种种不幸生活；他们为宪法草案的公布感到骄傲和幸福，大家纷纷提出保证，表示用实际行动来拥护宪法草案。钱运启说：“我们今天有权管理国家大事了，就要当好家作好主，我保证监督资方，加工订货要保质保量，按期完成。”
    国家关怀我们，我们热爱国家
    六月十九日早晨，唐山市第四区山东街第十五居民小组的妇女们，座谈了宪法草案。
    在旧社会受尽熬煎的劳动妇女巩秀云说：“宪法草案上写着国家保护妇女的权利，使我有说不出来的高兴。在旧社会谁看得起妇女。一九四六年我来到唐山市，丈夫序太当一个临时小工，干一天活有他吃的，没有我吃的。解放以后，序太到华新纺织公司做工，工人成了国家的主人，生活待遇有了很大的提高，一家人吃的穿的都变好了，我自己的生活也随着改善了。为了表示我对宪法草案的拥护，我一定保证序太吃好、休息好、不塌班，鼓励他在工厂积极生产。”
    李慧仙说：“在旧社会我们劳动人民连饭都吃不上，更没有受教育的权利。我小时妈妈常对我说：‘孩子！两眼不识字，就是睁眼瞎。’没想到妈妈得了一个暴病死了，我更没有上学的盼头了。解放后，家里分了土地和房子，过上了好日子，前年我进了速成识字班。宪法草案上写着公民有受教育的权利，我看了，心里有说不出来的高兴。”
    么树清是生过十一个孩子的母亲，但活下来的只有四个孩子。她听说宪法草案中规定婚姻、家庭、母亲和儿童受国家的保护，从内心里受到感动。她说：“解放前丈夫哲林劳动一天，领回二斤玉黍面。我每天去拣煤渣，还是三天两头要挨饿。记得闺女凤英在一周岁的时候，有病又没有奶吃，那时哲林舍不得吃饱饭，留下面食让我吃，好有奶养凤英，总算保住了孩子的生命，可是却落下个肠胃病根。在她下边我又生了七个孩子，因为生活困难，卫生条件又不好，一个也没有活成。解放以后，我们的生活好了，凤英的肠胃病到开滦医院治好了，现在已经进学校念书。后来我养的三个孩子，男的恩杰，女的凤兰和凤云都是用新法接生，现在都长的胖胖的。今年人民政府又为我们建立了保健站。现在国家又把保护母亲、儿童写在宪法草案里，这不光是妇女的幸福，也是我们子孙后代的幸福。国家关怀我们，我们要热爱国家。”
    到会的每一个妇女，都发表了自己的感想，她们一致认为宪法草案的一字一句都关怀着人民的利益，关怀着妇女的利益。
    我们再也不会受践踏了
    贵阳市百货业店员工会六月二十九日下午开宪法草案座谈会。
    座谈会上，店员工人表现了对宪法草案的衷心拥护和感激。
    他们谈到在解放前，当学徒一天起码要做十三、四小时的工作，还要替老板太太抱娃娃，洗尿布，倒马桶。而待遇呢？一般是三年拿不到工资，吃的是剩菜冷饭，穿的是老板“赐给”的破烂衣服，还要挨打挨骂。这种痛苦的生活今天已见不到了。店员有了自己的组织——工会，工资适当地提高了。并且，在工会的组织领导下，还有定期的政治和业务学习，以及各项文娱体育活动，保证了店员工人智力和体力的发展。这与旧社会对比起来，真是有天上和地下的区别啊！百货业店员工会委员周俊钦说：宪法草案中规定国家特别关怀青年体力和智力的发展，可是，在旧社会，我还不到十二岁就去帮人干沉重的活。照像基层工会委员、开罗照像馆老技工李惠瞻说：我从十六、七岁当学徒以来，总是摆脱不了贫困，我常常担心老了无法生活。解放后，人民政府公布了劳保条例，现在公布的宪法草案，规定劳动者年老丧失劳动力时可享受国家的物质帮助，这怎么能使我不兴奋！
    在座谈会上许多店员工人表示：要以实际行动拥护宪法草案。周俊钦说：今后我保证：加强对宪法草案的学习，向广大人民群众，特别是店员工人宣传解释；克服工作中的缺点，提高工作效率；要切实监督资本家遵守国家对资本主义工商业的利用、限制和改造的政策。其他很多店员工人也都纷纷表示：要正确地执行国家对资本主义工商业的政策，向一切非法行为进行坚决的斗争。
