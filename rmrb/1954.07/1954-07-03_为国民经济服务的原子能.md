    The discovery of natural and artificial radioactive phenomena and the research on chain reactions of heavy atomic nuclei fission are of great significance for the development of productive forces. The use of atomic energy and radioactive materials for peaceful construction purposes has particularly grand prospects in our socialist society. While the Soviet Union is seeking to utilize atomic energy for industrial purposes, the reactionary forces of imperialist countries only regard atomic energy as a tool for aggression against the people of other countries. The Soviet Union is constantly striving to ban the use of atomic weapons and other weapons of mass destruction, and is making every effort to eliminate the danger of using the great scientific discoveries of atomic energy utilization methods for destructive purposes.
                    ×××
    At present, industrial atomic energy can already be obtained in atomic (uranium) piles. In this type of atomic pile, nuclear reactions that release atomic energy in the form of thermal energy are being carried out according to human will. These thermal energies can be used to drive gas and steam turbines.
    In this way, with atomic piles, turbines can be used to rotate generators, converting atomic energy into electrical energy, which is then sent to consumers—factories and homes—through lines. Materials discarded during production can also be utilized. For example, boiling water produced by waste steam can be used for heating.
    As everyone knows, the main source of atomic energy at present is uranium, a metal that appears in nature in the form of compounds with other chemical elements. The left side of the figure shows the preparation process of using uranium as atomic fuel. Uranium compounds (1), extracted from mines, are sent to chemical and metallurgical plants after preliminary processing in the ore dressing plant. Metallurgical plants manufacture uranium rods of various sizes with very pure chemical composition (2). These uranium rods are loaded into atomic piles to become atomic fuel.
    The atomic energy released due to the fission of uranium-235 atomic nuclei also produces a large number of various radioactive substances in this process. In addition, under the action of atomic piles, a new element—plutonium—can be obtained from the main isotope uranium-238.
    After a period of time, the uranium rods are taken out of the atomic pile. The various radioactive substances accumulated in the uranium rods can be chemically separated from the uranium. The resulting plutonium compounds (3) can be processed into plutonium. Like uranium-235, it is prone to nuclear fission chain reactions and releases atomic energy.
    Currently, atomic energy can only be released and utilized from the fission of uranium, thorium, and plutonium atomic nuclei, as well as from the process of synthesizing helium atomic nuclei from hydrogen isotope atomic nuclei. However, there is no doubt that the number of materials that can produce atomic energy will increase in the future. The total reserves of atomic energy hidden around us in nature are virtually infinite. The atomic energy contained in any kilogram of material is equivalent to the chemical energy of 2.7 million tons of coal, or 25 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity. This is 1.5 times more than the annual power generation of the world's largest hydroelectric power station—the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station.
    Science is not only striving to expand the types of materials that can release atomic energy, but also to increase the released energy. The greater the huge potential of atomic energy can be rapidly and widely applied to peaceful purposes, the more perfect the methods of releasing and utilizing this ability will become.
    Establishing specialized atomic energy stations to produce heat and electricity is one way to utilize atomic energy.
      Compared with thermal power plants using general fuels, atomic energy stations have many advantages. The concentration of energy in atomic fuel is very high. This ensures greater compactness of production. The thermal energy obtained from a piece of uranium block of fourteen cubic centimeters (almost only one-third of a matchbox) is equal to the thermal energy generated by burning one million cubic meters of gas, eight hundred cubic meters of coal, or four hundred and seventy cubic meters of oil. There is no ash or smoke above the atomic energy station, and there is no need to transport air to maintain the nuclear fission.
    In this way, atomic energy stations completely avoid various problems related to the transportation of fuel and ash, as well as various expenses related to these costs. It is most suitable to establish such stations in areas where there are no large reserves of ordinary fuel and water power.
    Of course, measures should be taken at atomic energy stations to protect workers from radiation burns from atomic piles. For this purpose, the atomic pile needs to be surrounded by thick concrete walls and steel plates, and all loading, unloading, repairing and operating work of the atomic pile should be automated. Since atomic piles do not require air to carry out nuclear fission, atomic energy stations should be located underground, which can further prevent radiation from harming residents in nearby areas. The right side of the figure shows the underground location of this atomic energy station.
    The development prospects of using atomic energy to propel various engines are very broad. Atomic engines are first and foremost most suitable for objects that require the lightest fuel weight and the smallest volume, while maintaining a certain speed and range. In this regard, there are submarines, airplanes, and various rocket engines, which can be used for interstellar flight.
    What results can be obtained by using atomic energy in airplanes? As everyone knows, modern aviation engines still consume a lot of fuel per horsepower, and even short-distance flights require a lot of fuel reserves. In order to increase range and improve flight speed, it is necessary to greatly increase fuel reserves. However, it is clear that there is a certain limit to this increase in reserves, which affects the increase in the range and speed of general aircraft. The use of nuclear fuel can fundamentally change this situation. Under the condition that the effective coefficient of the aero-engine is 20%, the engine of 6,000 horsepower consumes only about one gram of nuclear fuel (uranium) per hour. Therefore, in this case, the weight of the fuel only accounts for a negligible part of the weight of the aircraft, which can help greatly increase flight speed and range.
    As everyone knows, modern submarines need to regularly replenish fuel and oxygen reserves during navigation. This limits the underwater range of submarines. The use of atomic fuel in submarines can greatly increase the range of navigation. Because the inherent concentration of nuclear fuel and the fact that nuclear reactions do not require oxygen assistance are most suitable for increasing the range of underwater vessels. It is relatively simple to supply the crew with the oxygen necessary for breathing, because the amount required in this area is limited after all. For example, submarines equipped with atomic engines can navigate under the ice in the Arctic.
    The characteristics of nuclear fuel make it most suitable for use in long-range rockets. Rockets are usually propelled by the reaction force created by the high-speed ejection of substances produced by the combustion of fuel. When flying to the moon or other celestial bodies, the rocket should have a speed that can overcome the Earth's gravity, and the speed should exceed 11,200 meters per second. Even if the best chemical fuel is used—which can ensure that the substances produced by combustion are ejected at a speed of nearly 3,300 meters per second—when the rocket flies to other celestial bodies, the weight of this fuel will account for 96% of the original weight of the rocket. The structure of the rocket caused by this situation makes it virtually impossible to achieve its original purpose. The use of nuclear fuel can ensure that the products of nuclear reactions fly out at high speed. For example, the heat energy released by nuclear fission can heat hydrogen up to 5-6,000 degrees, and make the hydrogen ejection speed reach 11,000 to 12,000 meters per second. This will make the speed of the rocket up to tens of thousands of kilometers per hour.
    There are still some enormous difficulties to overcome in the application of atomic energy in aircraft, ships and rockets. For example, in order to carry out interplanetary flight, it is necessary to manufacture exceptionally strong combustion chambers and rocket nozzles that can withstand the ultra-high temperature of the discharged gas. All of this, no doubt, will be successfully solved by science, just as all other issues related to the use of radioactive materials for peaceful purposes have been successfully solved by science. What is referred to here is the labeled atom method, which plays an important role in studying various chemical and biological processes. The atoms of radioactive substances are also called labeled atoms. These atoms, due to their radioactivity, are easily discovered and identified. For example, by adding artificial radioactive phosphorus to ordinary phosphorus, it is possible to determine their route, diffusion rate and accumulation location when plants absorb these phosphorus. This is especially important in studying the process of plants absorbing various fertilizers.
    The scale of radioactive materials used in the industrial sector is very extensive. For example, metallurgical engineers need to determine the transit time of blast furnace gas. Previously, only approximate and rough measurements could be made for this. Not long ago, radioactive materials were used in this area—radioactive element—radon—was put into the gas leading to the blast furnace. In this way, after determining the moment when radioactive atoms appear at the top of the blast furnace, the flow time of the gas can be measured very accurately. This is of great significance for the improvement of the blast furnace smelting process.
    Science has come a long way from the discovery of radioactive phenomena to the formulation of practical methods for obtaining atomic energy. The Nineteenth National Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union pointed out that the Soviet state, which has the real possibility of producing atomic energy, is very concerned about using this new energy for peaceful purposes and benefiting the people; because the utilization of atomic energy will infinitely expand man's control over the forces of nature, it has opened up unlimited possibilities for improving productivity, promoting technological and cultural progress, and increasing social wealth. In implementing the instructions of the 19th National Congress of the Party, Soviet scientists are working hard so that the great possibilities opened up to us by atomic energy can be used to benefit the people and improve their well-being.

    为国民经济服务的原子能
    苏联中校工程师物理数学候补博士、副教授  甫·米哈依洛夫
    苏联少校工程师技术科学候补博士、副教授  姆·姆克德契夫
    自然的和人为的放射现象的发现与对重原子核分裂的链锁反应的研究，对于生产力的发展具有重大的意义。利用原子能和放射性物质来达到和平建设的目的，在我们社会主义社会中，具有特别宏伟的远景。当苏联正在设法利用原子能于工业目的时，帝国主义国家的反动势力却把原子能仅看做是对其它国家人民进行侵略的一个工具。苏联不断地争取禁止使用原子武器和其它大规模的屠杀武器，竭力消除想把原子能的利用方法的伟大科学发现用于破坏性目的的危险。
                    ×××
    目前，在原子（铀）堆中已经可以取得工业用的原子能。在这类原子堆中正在实现依从人类意志进行的、以热能的形式放出原子能的核子反应。这些热能可用来推动瓦斯和蒸汽涡轮。
    这样，有了原子堆，就可以用涡轮转动发电机，把原子能变为电能，再用线路把它们送给消费者——工厂和住宅。在进行生产时废弃不用的物质也可以加以利用。例如：由废汽所产生的沸水就可以用来取暖。
    大家知道，目前原子能的主要来源是铀，这是一种以和其它化学元素化合的形式出现于自然界的金属。图的左方就是表明用铀作原子核燃料的准备过程。铀的化合物（1），从矿山中开采出来后，经过选矿厂的初步加工，送往化学和冶金工厂。冶金工厂制造了各种尺寸的化学成分很纯的铀棒（2）。这些铀棒被装填在原子堆里而成为原子核的燃料。
    由于铀—235原子核的分裂而放出原子能，在这一过程中同时也获得了大量的各种放射性物质。此外，在原子堆的作用下，还可以从主要同位素铀—238获得新元素—钚。
    经过一段时间，把铀棒从原子堆中取出。铀棒中积存的各种放射性物质可以用化学方法使它与铀分离开来。这时所取得的钚的化合物（3）在加工后就可以成为钚。它和铀—235一样容易发生原子核分裂的链锁反应，并放出原子能。
    目前仅能从铀、钍、钚的原子核的分裂中以及把氢的同位素原子核合成氦原子核的过程中放出原子能并加以利用。但是毫无疑问，将来生产原子能的物质会增多起来。围绕我们的自然界所蕴藏的原子能总储藏量实际上是无限的。任何一公斤的物质中所含的原子能都相当于两百七十万吨煤的化学能，或二百五十亿瓩小时的电力。这将比世界上最大的水电站——古比雪夫水电站一年的发电量多一点五倍。
    科学不仅在努力扩大能放出原子能的物质的种类，并且也力求增大提出的能量。原子能的巨大潜力愈能迅速地广泛应用于和平目的，那么这种能力的放出和利用方法也会愈趋于完善。
    建立专门的原子能站来生产热能和电能是利用原子能的方法之一。
      比起用一般燃料的火力发电站来，原子能站拥有很多优点。在原子核的燃料中能量的集中度非常之高。这就保证了生产的较大的紧凑性。从一块十四立方公分的铀块（几乎只等于火柴盒的三分之一）中取得的热能就等于燃烧一百万立方公尺的瓦斯、八百立方公尺的煤、四百七十立方公尺的石油所产生的热能。原子能站上空没有灰烬和烟，也没有必要输送空气来维持原子核分裂的进行。
    这样在原子能站上便完全不发生有关燃料、灰烬的运输以及和这类耗费有关的各种问题。在没有蕴藏大量普通燃料和水力的地区，建立这种站最为适宜。
    当然，在原子能站上应当采取保护工作人员免受原子堆辐射线灼伤的措施。为了这个目的，就需要用厚的混凝土墙壁和钢板把原子堆包围起来，所有原子堆的装卸、修理和操纵工作都应自动化。由于原子堆不需要空气就可以进行核的分裂，因此原子能站应设于地下，这就可以更加防止辐射线伤及附近地区的居民。图的右方显示了这种原子能站在地下的位置。
    用原子能来推动各种发动机的发展远景是很广阔的。原子发动机首先最宜使用于燃料重量最轻、体积最小、而又必须保持一定速度和航程的物体上。在这方面有潜水艇、飞机以及各种火箭发动机，这些火箭可以用来作星体间的飞行。
    把原子能用于飞机上可能得到什么结果呢？大家知道，现代的航空发动机每一马力所消耗的燃料仍然很多，甚至短距离的飞行都需要不少的燃料储备。为了增加航程和提高飞行速度就必须大大增加燃料的储备。但是，很明显，这种储备的增加有一定的限度，它影响一般飞机的航程和速度的增加。采用原子核燃料可以根本改变这种情况。在航空发动机的有效系数为百分之二十的条件下，六千匹马力的发动机每小时仅消耗大约一克的原子核燃料
  （铀）。因此，在这种情况下，燃料的重量只占飞机重量无足轻重的一部分，这就可以帮助大大提高飞行速度和航程。
    大家知道，现代的潜水艇在航行中需要定期补充燃料和氧气储备。这就限制了潜艇水底航程。潜水艇使用原子燃料可以大大增加航行距离。因为原子核燃料的特有的集中性和原子核反应的不需要氧气帮助，都是最适合于增加水底船只的航程的。供应船员们以呼吸所必要的氧气究竟比较简单，因为这方面的需要量毕竟是有限的。例如，装有原子能发动机的潜水艇可以在北极的冰下航行。
    原子核燃料的特点使它最适合于在远距离的火箭上使用。火箭通常是借助于高速度喷出的燃料燃烧后产生的物质所造成的反冲力而推进。在向月亮或其它天体飞行时，火箭应当具有能克服地心吸力的速度，每秒速度应超过一万一千二百公尺。即便使用最好的化学燃料——这种燃料能保证燃烧产生的物质以每秒近三千三百公尺的速度喷出——在火箭向其它星体飞行时，这种燃料的重量也会占去火箭最初重量的百分之九十六。因这一情况所引起的火箭的结构，使它实际上不能达到原来的目的。使用原子核燃料可以保证原子核反应产物以高速度飞出。例如，利用原子核分裂所放出的热能可以使氢的热度高达五—六千度，并使氢的喷出速度达到每秒一万一千到一万二千公尺。这样就会使火箭的速度每小时高达数万公里。
    在运用原子能于飞机、船只和火箭方面仍有一些巨大的困难需要克服。例如，为了进行星球间的飞行，必须制造异常牢固的燃烧室和火箭的喷嘴，这些部件要能经得住排出的气体的超高温。所有这
  一切，无疑问的，都将由科学予以成功地解决，正像所有有关利用放射性物质于和平目的的其它问题已由科学所成功地解决那样。这里所指的是在研究各种化学和生物学过程中起着重要作用的标记原子法。放射性物质的原子又叫做标记原子。这种原子，由于它们的放射性能，很容易被发现和辨认出来。例如，在平常的磷中放进人工的放射性的磷，那就能在植物吸收这些磷的时候确定它们的路线、扩散速度和蓄积的地方。这在研究植物对各种肥料的吸收过程时，尤其具有重要意义。
   工业部门运用放射性物质的规模是非常广泛的。例如，冶金工程人员需要确定高炉煤气的通过时间。以前，对此仅能作近似的、粗略的测定。不久前，在这方面采用了放射性物质，——在通往高炉的煤气中，放入了放射性元素——镭射气。这样，在高炉上部确定放射性原子出现的时刻后，就能十分准确地测出煤气流动的时间。这对于高炉熔炼过程的改进有着很大的意义。
    从放射性现象的发现时起，到制定取得原子能的实际方法止，科学已走了很长的一段路程。苏联共产党第十九次代表大会曾指出，拥有生产原子能的现实可能性的苏维埃国家，非常关心于使这种新的能量用于和平目的、并为人民造福；因为对原子能的利用将无限地扩大人对自然力的控制，它在人类面前已开辟了提高生产力、促进技术和文化进步和增加社会财富的无限可能性。苏联的科学工作者在执行党第十九次代表大会的指示中，正在努力工作以便使原子能为我们开辟的巨大可能性，能被用于为人民造福和改进他们的生活福利。
