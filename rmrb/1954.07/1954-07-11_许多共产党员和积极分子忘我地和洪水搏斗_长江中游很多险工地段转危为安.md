    Many Communist Party Members and Activists Fought the Flood Selflessly
    Many Dangerous Sections in the Middle Reaches of the Yangtze River Were Turned from Danger to Safety
    In the flood prevention and rescue work in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River and the Han River basin, many Communist Party members, government officials, model laborers, and active peasant elements led the broad masses of people to fight the flood heroically, turning many dangerous sections from danger to safety.
    Since the beginning of summer this year, continuous heavy rains have fallen in Hubei Province, and the water levels of the rivers have been rising continuously. In early July, about one-third of the dike section of the Huang (Mei) Guang (Ji) Dike in Feijiawan, which protects the lives and property of the people in several counties south of the Yangtze River, experienced slope failure, and the situation was extremely critical. At this time, He Daohai, deputy commander of the Huanggang Special District Flood Control Headquarters, and Cai Qiong, commander of the Huangmei County Flood Control Headquarters, led the peasant masses to overcome the difficulty of obtaining earth and secured the dangerous work. All the cadres and farmers of Zhuhe Town, near Dashiwan in the Bianhe District of Jianli County, upon hearing the news of the breach in Dashiwan, more than 500 people went to the scene of the incident with sacks, wooden stakes, and other tools to help with the rescue. Zheng Jiren, the director of the Public Security Police Station, took the lead in going into the water to drive piles, and then everyone else bravely went into the water to block the breach. During the rescue, Liu Shuyuan, a cadre of the Zhuhe Town Supply and Marketing Cooperative, braved the wind and waves to wade across the river to cut down trees, and transported the trees across the river for use in blocking the breach. Encouraged by him, the rescue workers finally repaired the breach in Dashiwan within four hours, saving the fields in the area from flood disaster.
    Communist Party members in various places took the lead in going into the water during the rescue work, blocking the dangerous situations. More than 4,000 Communist Party members in the Huanggang Special District went to the dikes. When leaks appeared in Yanyu Tao and Luo Jia Zhou in Xishui County, Tu Yuanxin, a female Communist Party member from Qianpu Township, immediately led more than 300 people to the dike to rescue. She took the lead in jumping into the sluice gate and standing in the rapids to carry out rescue, and her heroic behavior motivated many people to actively participate in the rescue, thus quickly blocking the leaks. During the flood prevention and rescue work, the broad masses of active peasant elements actively exerted their unique enthusiasm. On June 25, many dikes in Guangji County were in danger, and the young peasant Zou Zongli immediately mobilized all nine members of their mutual aid team to go to the dike for rescue. Zou Zongli took the lead in braving the mountain flood waves of more than five feet high, tied straw to his body, and rowed to the breached dike section, blocking the breach; under his leadership, everyone worked hard to rescue, turning this dangerous section from danger to safety. Now these people who have selflessly participated in the rescue have been praised and commended by the party and government leading organs and the broad masses of people.

    许多共产党员和积极分子忘我地和洪水搏斗
    长江中游很多险工地段转危为安
    在长江中游和汉水流域的防汛抢险中，许多共产党员、人民政府机关干部、模范民工和农民积极分子带领广大人民群众英勇地和洪水搏斗，使很多险工地段转危为安。
    今年夏季以来，湖北省内连降暴雨，江河水位不断上涨。七月上旬，保护江南数县人民生命财产的长江黄（梅）广（济）大堤费家湾一带险工有三分之一的堤段发生脱坡，情况万分紧急。这时黄冈专区防汛指挥部副指挥长贺导海、黄梅县防汛指挥部指挥长蔡琼，领导农民群众克服了取土困难，抢住了险工。监利县汴河区大石垸临近的朱河镇全体干部、农民，听到大石垸溃口的消息，五百多人带着麻袋、木桩等用具前往出事地点帮助抢救。公安派出所长郑继仁首先带头下水打桩，接着大家也都奋不顾身地下水抢堵溃口。在抢救中，朱河镇供销合作社干部刘树垣冒着风浪涉水过河伐树，并把树木运过河来，供堵口之用。抢险的民工群众在他鼓舞下，终于在四小时内把大石垸溃口抢修好，使垸内的田地免除了洪水灾害。
    各地的共产党员在抢险中都带头下水，抢阻险象。黄冈专区有四千多共产党员上堤。浠水县严鱼套和罗家洲出现漏洞时，钱铺乡女共产党员涂远新马上带着三百多人上堤抢救。她带头跳下闸口站在激流中进行抢救，她的英勇行为带动许多人员积极抢救，因而迅速堵住了漏洞。防汛抢险中，广大的农民积极分子积极发挥了他们特有的热情。六月二十五日广济县很多堤坝出险，青年农民邹宗礼马上动员他们互助组的九个人全部上堤抢险。邹宗礼首先冒着五尺多高的山洪浪头，身上捆着稻草划到被冲毁的堤段，堵住了溃口；在他带头下，大家努力抢救，使这段险工转危为安。现在这些忘我抢险的人们，都受到了党政领导机关和广大人民的表扬和称赞。
