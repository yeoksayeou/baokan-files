    Further Develop Radio Calisthenics

    On the basis of the gradual popularization of radio calisthenics, the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission and the Central Broadcasting Administration, in accordance with the needs of the masses, and in conjunction with relevant departments, formulated a preliminary draft of illustrations for the second set of radio calisthenics after more than three months of repeated research. This was then trialed in key factories, schools, and government offices, incorporating the opinions of the masses for revision, and finally a decision was made to announce and promote it. The formulation of the illustrations for the second set of radio calisthenics shows that mass sports in our country have been further developed.

    Since the promotion of radio calisthenics among the people nationwide at the end of 1951, thanks to the advocacy of the Party and the People's Government, the cooperation of trade unions and the Communist Youth League, and the efforts of physical education workers, radio calisthenics has been gradually promoted in factories, schools, government offices, and even among some urban residents, with a continuous increase in the number of participants. Facts have proved that radio calisthenics not only has the effect of exercising the body and strengthening physical fitness, but is also an important step in developing mass sports activities.

    However, since the summer of this year, the number of people participating in the exercises has shown a downward trend. In seven units of the Chongqing Municipal People's Government, 80 percent of the staff persisted in doing the exercises a month ago, but recently it has dropped to 20 percent. Similar phenomena have occurred in Beijing, Tianjin, and other places. This situation shows that many government office workers still lack a proper understanding of the role of radio calisthenics. This situation should be changed. To this end, it is necessary to publicize and address the various ideas that hinder the development of radio calisthenics, so that everyone can understand the role of radio calisthenics in exercising the body.

    The various movements of radio calisthenics and their arrangement sequence are arranged according to the laws of general physical exercise and the requirements of rational exercise of various parts of the body. They include upper limb exercises, lower limb exercises, whole body exercises, lateral exercises, abdominal and back exercises, average exercises, and whole body exercises. Therefore, as long as you persist in exercising for a long time, you can develop muscles, increase lung capacity, promote blood circulation, and eliminate the decline or maldevelopment of certain parts of the body's functions caused by long-term lack of exercise, thereby enhancing metabolism and enhancing the ability to resist disease. On the other hand, gymnastics can also cultivate people's interest in engaging in other sports. The basic exercises and auxiliary exercises of track and field, ball games, swimming, skating, and apparatus gymnastics are all based on gymnastics. In addition, radio calisthenics also has many other advantages, such as simple movements, easy to practice, no special venues and equipment required, and is not restricted by age or gender, which are all conditions that make it easy to promote. However, in order to achieve the actual effect of exercise, we must correct the attitude of "doing it occasionally" or "three days of fishing, two days of drying nets" that simply starts from interest, and the idea of "immediate results" that attempts to see results in a short period of time.

    For the past two and a half years since the promotion of radio calisthenics, many people have strengthened their physical fitness as a result of persisting in doing the exercises, and they feel that the amount of exercise in the first set of radio calisthenics can no longer meet their exercise needs. Now, the illustrations for the second set of radio calisthenics have been announced and promoted, which can meet their requirements; however, those who are weak and have just started exercising are still suitable for doing the first set of radio calisthenics. Party committees and people's governments at all levels should, according to the actual situation, mobilize and organize the broad masses to persist in doing the exercises and further improve the people's health.

### 进一步开展广播体操运动

    进一步开展广播体操运动
    在广播体操运动逐渐普及的基础上，中央人民政府体育运动委员会和中央广播事业局根据群众需要，会同有关部门经过三个多月的反复研究，制订出第二套广播体操各项运动图解初稿；再经重点工厂、学校、机关试行，吸取群众意见进行修改，最后决定公布推行。从第二套广播体操各项运动图解的制订，可以看出我国群众性体育运动已获进一步开展。
    自一九五一年底在全国人民中推行广播体操运动以来，由于党和人民政府的倡导，工会、青年团的配合，以及体育工作者的努力，广播体操运动已在工厂、学校、机关，甚至在部分城市居民中逐步得到推广，参加作操的人不断增加。事实证明：广播体操运动不仅具有锻炼身体，增强体质的功效，同时还是开展群众性体育运动的重要步骤。
    但是，今年夏季以来，出操人数呈现下降趋势。重庆市人民政府有七个单位，一个月前还有百分之八十的工作人员坚持作操，最近却降至百分之二十。北京、天津等地也有类似现象。这种情况表明：许多机关工作人员对广播体操运动的作用还缺乏应有的认识。这种状况是应当改变的。为此，必须针对阻碍广播体操运动开展的各种思想，进行宣传，使每一个人都能了解广播体操对于锻炼身体的作用。
    广播体操的各项运动和它的排列顺序，是按照一般体育锻炼进行的规律，和身体各部位合理锻炼的要求排定的，它包括了上肢运动、下肢运动、全身运动、体侧运动、腹背运动、平均运动和全身运动，因此，只要长期坚持锻炼，就可以使肌肉发达，肺活量增加，促进血液循环，消除身体机能某些部位因长期得不到锻炼而引起的衰退或畸形发展的现象，从而增进新陈代谢作用，增强抵抗疾病侵袭的能力。另一方面，体操还能培养人们从事其它体育运动的兴趣，田径、球类、游泳、滑冰和器械体操等的基本练习和辅助运动，都是以体操为基础的。另外，广播体操运动还具备其它许多优点，如动作简单，容易操练，不需要特别的场地和器械设备，同时还不受年龄、性别的限制等，这都是它容易推广的条件。但是，要使我们能够获得锻炼的实效，必须要纠正那种“偶而为之”或“三天打鱼、两天晒网”单纯从兴趣出发的态度，和那种“立竿见影”企图在短时间内就要见效的想法。
    广播体操运动推行两年半来，许多人坚持作操的结果，体质已经增强，他们感到第一套广播体操的各项运动的运动量已不能适应自己锻炼的需要了。现在，第二套广播体操各项运动图解已经公布推行，可以满足他们的要求；但是，体弱和刚开始锻炼的人，仍适宜作第一套广播体操。各地党委和人民政府应根据实际情况，动员和组织广大群众坚持作操，进一步改善人民健康状况。
