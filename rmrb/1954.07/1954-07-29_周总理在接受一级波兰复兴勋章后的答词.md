Respected Chairman of the State Council, Comrade:
    Today, the government of the People's Republic of Poland has awarded me the highest national order—the Order of Polonia Restituta, First Class, which makes me feel very honored. Please allow me to express my heartfelt gratitude for the solemn honor bestowed upon me by the Polish government. At the same time, in accepting such an honor, I cannot help but feel very ashamed. Because as far as I personally am concerned, I have done limited work in the cause of defending international peace and promoting friendly cooperation between China and Poland, and I am really not worthy of receiving such a solemn honor. I believe that such a solemn honor should belong to the Chinese people. Today, the government of the People's Republic of Poland awarded me this medal, in effect, expressing the most precious friendship to the Chinese people once again through me. I am deeply moved and encouraged by the awarding of this medal. I am willing to work harder and continue to struggle for the common cause of the people of China and Poland, that is, the cause of world peace.

    周总理在接受一级波兰复兴勋章后的答词敬爱的国务委员会主席同志：
    今天，波兰人民共和国政府授予我国家最高勋章——一级波兰复兴勋章，使我感到非常荣幸。请允许我对于波兰政府给我的隆重荣誉，表示衷心的感谢。同时，在接受这样的荣誉时，我又不能不感到非常惭愧。因为就我个人来说，我对保卫国际和平和促进中、波两国友好合作的事业，都还做得有限，实在够不上接受这样隆重的荣誉。我认为像这样隆重的荣誉应该归于中国人民。今天，波兰人民共和国政府给我颁发勋章，实际是通过我对中国人民又一次表示最珍贵的友谊。由于这一勋章的颁发，我深深地受到感动和策励。我愿更加努力，为中、波两国人民的共同事业，即世界和平的事业继续奋斗。
