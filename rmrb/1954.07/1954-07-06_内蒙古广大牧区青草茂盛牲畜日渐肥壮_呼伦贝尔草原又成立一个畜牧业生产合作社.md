Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, 5th: In the vast pastoral areas of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, including Xilin Gol, Hulunbuir, and Ulanqab, welcome rains fell in May and June, and the grass on the grasslands is growing densely and vigorously. Livestock, weakened by the wind, snow, and severe cold of winter and spring, are gradually becoming fat after feasting on the green grass. This spring, there was much wind and little rain in these areas, and some pastoral areas showed signs of drought. After the rain, the drought was eliminated, and all kinds of livestock were able to eat their fill of green grass around the end of May. Currently, Party and government leading organs at all levels in the Inner Mongolia pastoral areas are specifically leading herdsmen to focus on summer fattening, laying the foundation for autumn fattening, so that livestock can safely pass through winter and spring. Many herdsmen, in order to focus on the summer "foundation fattening," are joyfully riding their steeds and driving their herds to move to the lush summer pastures.

Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, 5th: Another animal husbandry production cooperative has been established on the Hulunbuir grasslands of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. This is the Huheletai Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative. The cooperative has a total of thirty-one male and female members, who elected Huheletai (a Communist Party member) as the director, and Sidebu and Xinggebu as deputy directors. The members voluntarily reported 608 head of livestock to the cooperative. The cooperative has one grass cutter, one hay rake, one shearing machine, nine iron-wheeled carts, two earthen houses, and public property such as sheds and enclosures.

The Huheletai Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative was gradually developed and established from mutual aid teams. In 1950, Huheletai and four other herding families gathered sheep grass together and organized a temporary mutual aid team, which later developed into a permanent mutual aid team of eight herding families. Over the years, they have improved livestock feeding management, reduced losses from wind, snow, and epidemic diseases, and livestock have increased year by year. By the eve of the establishment of the cooperative, the four herding families who initially joined the team had increased all their livestock from the original 32 head to 351 head. The increase in the number of livestock of the four herding families who joined later also exceeded that of ordinary herding families. The team also purchased a batch of collectively owned livestock and public property such as grass cutters. Before the establishment of the cooperative, the herdsmen of the mutual aid team, following the principle of voluntariness, went through more than three months of deliberation and discussion before establishing the animal husbandry production cooperative.

On June 20, the animal husbandry production cooperative held a grand establishment ceremony in the summer camp on the south bank of the Molgele River in Chen Barag Banner. The person in charge of the inspection team of the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government, the Agricultural and Pastoral Work Department of the Eastern Inner Mongolia Regional Committee of the Communist Party of China, and the heads of the Hulunbuir League Party Committees at all levels, as well as representatives of nearby herdsmen, went to congratulate them. To celebrate the establishment of the cooperative, the members also held recreational activities such as wrestling and horse racing.

    内蒙古广大牧区青草茂盛牲畜日渐肥壮
    呼伦贝尔草原又成立一个畜牧业生产合作社
    【新华社呼和浩特五日电】内蒙古自治区锡林郭勒、呼伦贝尔、乌兰察布等广大牧区，五、六月内普降喜雨，草原上的青草长得又密又旺。经过冬春两季风雪严寒折磨而瘦弱的牲畜，饱食青草后已日渐肥壮。今年春天，这些地方风大雨少，部分牧区已呈旱象。雨后旱象消除，各种牲畜在五月底前后都能吃饱青草。现在，内蒙古牧区各级党政领导机关正具体领导牧民抓好夏膘，为抓秋膘打下基础，好让牲畜安全过冬过春。许多牧民为了抓好夏季“基础膘”，正兴高采烈地骑着骏马，赶着畜群陆续移入水草丰美的夏营地。
    【新华社呼和浩特五日电】内蒙古自治区呼伦贝尔草原上又成立了一个畜牧业生产合作社，这就是胡和勒泰畜牧业生产合作社。全社共有男女社员三十一人，选出胡和勒泰（共产党员）为社长，斯德布、兴格布二人为副社长。社员自报入社的牲畜有六百零八头。全社有打草机、搂草机各一台，剪毛机一个，铁轮车九辆，土房两间以及棚圈等公共财产。
    胡和勒泰畜牧业生产合作社是从互助组逐步发展建立的。一九五零年胡和勒泰等四户牧民一起打羊草，组织了一个临时互助组，以后发展成八户牧民的常年互助组。几年来他们改善牲畜饲养管理，减少了风雪、疫病灾害的损失，牲畜逐年增加。到建社前夕，最初入组的四户牧民所有的大小牲畜，已从原有的三十二头增加到三百五十一头；后入组的四户牧民的牲畜增加数量，也超过了一般牧民。组内还添购了一批公有牲畜及打草机等公共财产。建社前，互助组的牧民们按照自愿的原则，经过了三个多月的酝酿和讨论，然后才成立畜牧业生产合作社。
    六月二十日，畜牧业生产合作社在陈巴尔虎旗莫尔格勒河南岸夏营地举行了隆重的建社典礼。中央人民政府民族事务委员会视察组负责人、中共内蒙古东部区委员会农牧工作部和中共呼伦贝尔盟各级党委负责人，以及附近的牧民代表等都前往祝贺。社员们为庆祝合作社的建立，还进行了摔跤、赛马等文娱活动。
