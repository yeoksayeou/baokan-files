Qinggou, located in the lower reaches of the Bei Fei River on the north bank of the Huai River in Anhui Province, is known as Qinghe Bay. I recently visited this place. When I entered Qinghe Bay, the sorghum in the fields was growing vigorously, and piles of wheat straw like small mountains surrounded the villages. Farmers were busy hoeing the fields and threshing the grain.

Qinghe Bay has about 20,000 mu of fertile land, which is rich in wheat and soybeans. The riverbed of the Bei Fei River, a tributary of the Huai River, was silted up, and this low-lying area was prone to flooding whenever it rained. For more than a decade, Qinghe Bay had not had a good harvest. In previous summers, people here could only see a vast expanse of water, collapsed houses, drowned trees, and villages like isolated islands surrounded by water. For more than a decade, the farmers living here lived a life of hardship, fleeing famine and fishing. After the Huai River harnessing project began, the farmers who had fled to other places returned to participate in the work. Last spring, a dam was built at Sifang Lake in the lower reaches of the Bei Fei River, and the Fei Xie diversion canal was dug. Since then, the area has been freed from flooding that had lasted for more than a decade. Although there were heavy rains last year and this spring, the floodwaters obediently flowed through the Fei Xie diversion canal into the Xie River. Qinghe Bay had its best harvest in more than a decade last autumn and this spring. Last autumn, the yield of soybeans was generally more than 100 jin per mu, and the best could reach about 200 jin. This spring, the yield of wheat was about 120 jin per mu, and the best reached more than 200 jin. According to statistics from Yangtaizi, Wu Xiangzi, and other four villages, more than 600,000 jin of soybeans and mung beans were harvested last autumn, and nearly 1 million jin of wheat were harvested this spring. After the bumper harvest, farmers began to build houses and purchase farm tools and livestock. According to statistics from the above four villages, more than 120 head of cattle, 50 head of horses and donkeys were purchased last winter and this spring, and more than a dozen large carts were also purchased. The farmers' enthusiasm for production has also been unprecedentedly high. This spring, the wheat fields were generally hoeed once, the spring land was plowed three to four times, harrowed six to eight times, and more than 3,000 jin of fertilizer were applied per mu of sorghum. The sorghum seedlings have now been hoeed five times. All of these are unprecedented in history. Especially last year, the farmers received education on the general task of the state during the transition period. More than 150 households in Yangtaizi, Wu Xiangzi, and other four villages participated in agricultural production cooperatives, accounting for more than 40 percent of the total number of farming households in these four villages. After joining the cooperatives, the farmers were even more enthusiastic about production. The cooperatives and cooperatives formulated cultivation plans for deep plowing and careful cultivation, field management, fertilization and weeding, and enthusiastically carried out labor competitions. I visited the Pioneer Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yangtaizi Village, the winner of the labor competition. Gao Tinghe, the head of the Pioneer Agricultural Production Cooperative and a first-class model worker in harnessing the Huai River, told me with a smile: "Our cooperative dug 290,000 jin of pond mud and accumulated more than 100,000 jin of ash fertilizer. The sorghum was hoeed five times and grew very well. More than 2,500 jin of fertilizer were applied per mu of mung bean and sesame fields, so we won the championship."

Recently, the state has also established a tractor station in Caolaoji near Qinghe Bay. This has greatly encouraged the farmers in Qinghe Bay, and they have gone to visit it one after another. "The Huai River is harnessed and the tractors are coming," "Join the cooperative quickly, and consolidate the scattered land into large plots so that the tractors can operate," "Without the industrialization of the country, how could there be tractors?" The farmers discussed enthusiastically. Now the farmers are drying and winnowing the newly harvested wheat, preparing to sell the surplus grain to the state. According to preliminary statistics from Yangtaizi, Wu Xiangzi, and other four villages, the planned sale of wheat is more than 460,000 jin.

    治理淮河改变了清河湾的面貌
    新华社记者　秦聿震
    安徽省淮河北岸北淝河下游清沟一带，人们都称为清河湾。记者最近访问了这个地方。当记者进入清河湾时，田野里的高粱生长旺盛，像小山一样的麦草堆层层包围着村庄。农民们正忙着锄地和打场。
    清河湾约有二万亩肥沃的土地，盛产小麦和黄豆。淮河支流北淝河河床淤塞，这个地势低洼的地方，每逢落雨，河水就漫溢成灾。十几年来，清河湾没有收过好庄稼。往年的夏天，人们在这里只能看到一片汪洋的大水，房屋倒塌，树木淹死，村庄像围在水里的孤岛一样。住在此地的农民，十几年来过着困苦的逃荒和捕鱼的生活。治淮工程开始后，逃到外地的农民回来参加了治淮。去年春天在北淝河下游四方湖的地方筑起一座拦河坝，开挖了淝澥引河，从此解除这一带十几年来的水灾。去年和今春虽然又落了大雨，洪水很驯服地经过淝澥引河流入澥河，清河湾去秋今春都是十几年来没有过的好收成。去年秋天黄豆每亩一般能收一百斤以上，好的能收二百斤左右。今春小麦每亩收一百二十斤左右，最好的收到二百多斤。据杨台子、吴巷子等四个村的统计，去年秋天收到黄豆和绿豆六十多万斤，今春又收到小麦近百万斤。丰收之后，农民开始修盖房屋，购买农具和牲畜，据以上四个村的统计，去冬和今春买牛一百二十多头，马和驴五十多头，还买了十几辆大车。农民们生产积极性也空前提高。今春麦田普遍锄了一遍，春地犁了三遍到四遍，耙了六遍到八遍，高粱每亩施肥三千多斤，高粱苗现在已锄过五遍。所有这些，都是历史上从来没有过的。特别是去年农民受到了国家过渡时期总任务的教育，杨台子、吴巷子等四个村参加农业生产合作社的就有一百五十多户，占这四个村的总农户百分之四十以上。入社后，农民生产劲头更大，社与社之间订出了深耕细作、田间管理、施肥除草等耕作计划，热烈开展了劳动竞赛。记者访问了劳动竞赛优胜者的杨台子村先锋农业生产合作社。先锋农业生产合作社社长、治淮一等模范高廷贺笑着告诉记者：“我们社里挖了二十九万斤塘泥，积了十几万斤灰肥，高粱锄了五遍，高粱长得很好，绿豆和芝麻地里每亩又上肥二千五百多斤，所以我们得到了优胜。”
    最近，国家又在清河湾附近的曹老集设立了拖拉机站。这给清河湾农民鼓舞极大，纷纷前往参观。“治好淮河拖拉机又来了”、“快入合作社吧，要把零地聚成大块地，拖拉机才能开呢”、“没有国家的工业化，那能有拖拉机呀”。农民议论纷纷。现在农民正把新收的小麦晒干扬净，准备把余粮卖给国家，据杨台子、吴巷子等四个村初步统计，预售小麦达四十六万多斤。
