Crossing the Nu River

He Li

Traveling south from Qamdo, passing through the Bangda Grassland, between the towering Tanggula Mountains and Nu Mountains, there is a winding and deep canyon, at the bottom of which flows a roaring river, and that is the Nu River.

In July 1953, it was the flood season, and the water of the Nu River was even more furious. The flow rate of the water reached eight cubic meters per second, and the water depth reached dozens of meters, with the turbulent waves impacting the cliffs on both sides. The Tibetan people on the east and west banks of the river were separated for a long time by this treacherous river.

However, our road line must pass through here, and the advance team of the road construction troops descended to the east bank of the Nu River along the Bangda Grassland. The advance team had only a rubber boat they carried with them, and no other tools for crossing the river. Was it possible to launch a boat in the river? A surveyor said: The river water is now rapid and cold, making it impossible to measure. We can take a dog to try it out. If the dog can float without sinking, the rubber boat can cross the river. If the dog sinks, the rubber boat cannot cross either. A dog was immediately brought and put into the river. Who knew that as soon as the dog entered the river, it was swept to the bottom by the flood.

What to do? Heroes must never bow their heads to difficulties. They decided to try crossing with an empty boat first, with an iron wire tied to the bow to control the boat's movement.

The soldiers carried the rubber boat to the riverbank. Unexpectedly, as soon as it entered the water, the boat was swept downstream by the huge waves. At this moment, the iron wire was caught on a rock, and with a "snap," the iron wire broke. The rubber boat flew downstream like a wild horse. The rubber boat! How could they let this only river-crossing tool of the entire army be washed away?

"We must get it back!"

Suddenly, three comrades, Li Wenyan, Cui Ximing, and others, jumped out from among the soldiers and immediately chased downstream along the riverbank. They climbed mountains when they encountered them and jumped off cliffs when they encountered them. They chased for eight li to a hilltop, where they discovered that the rubber boat was swirling in an eddy about twenty meters from the shore, but below was a cliff that could not be jumped down. Just as they were in trouble, they suddenly saw a Tibetan coming from the top of the mountain with a rope. They borrowed the rope from the Tibetan and lowered themselves one by one to the riverbank. Li Wenyan first took off his clothes and jumped into the river, saying, "Comrades, be prepared. If I sacrifice myself, you must not let this boat be washed away!"

Although it was already July, the river water was icy cold due to the high mountains and deep valleys, and Li Wenyan's whole body was numb. But regardless of everything, he used all his strength to cut through the waves and pounce fiercely towards the boat. He finally grabbed the small boat that was about to be swept away by the waves, escaped the whirlpool, and floated back to the riverbank. At this moment, Li Wenyan just showed a victorious smile and before he could speak, he suddenly relaxed and fainted to the ground, his entire body turning blue. The comrades on the shore immediately dried his body, put on his clothes, and waited for him to slowly regain consciousness. The three of them then carried the boat back to the troops.

The boat had been retrieved, but they still couldn't cross the river. The troops had been here for more than ten days. What to do? So the chief of staff of the troops decided to send Deputy Platoon Leader Cui Ximing to select a few brave, strong, and buoyant comrades to cross the Nu River by boat. Cui Ximing selected five people, including Li Wenyan and Niu Wuxiao, along with himself, making a total of six people, who tied the iron wire to the boat, preparing to use it as a rope slide after crossing the river. Everyone took off their clothes before boarding the boat, preparing to float in the water if the boat capsized.

The rubber boat set off towards the center of the river. Unexpectedly, as soon as it left the shore, the iron wire got caught on a rock on the riverbank and couldn't move forward. The men immediately returned to the east bank, changed to electrical wire, and continued to advance. Unexpectedly, when they reached the center of the river, the electrical wire was broken by the flood. At this moment, the rubber boat was being impacted by huge waves, rushing straight downstream. Li Wenyan shouted, "Paddle harder, this is the last hurdle!" So everyone paddled hard, finally enabling the boat to break through the rapids and successfully reach the west bank. The river-crossing situation was opened up.

But how to get the entire road construction army across to the west bank? What a complex problem this was! Not to mention ferrying the entire army, even the food and clothing for these six people were still left on the east bank and couldn't be transported over. At this time, dusk had fallen, and the evening wind of the Nu River blew in gusts from the canyon, stinging the warriors and making them shiver. The six men had to huddle together to get through the cold night. The comrades on the east bank, in order to send clothes and food to the west bank, the next day used two wooden stakes to make a raft, tied it with a No. 8 iron cable, and put it into the center of the river, letting the comrades on the west bank take a boat to the center of the river to pick it up. In this way, because the raft had been washed to the center of the river by the flood, the comrades on the west bank saved effort.

The first iron cable was pulled over, and they used the terrain to drive steel stakes into both banks and erected the first small rope slide, high in the east and low in the west. At this time, because the river water was roaring, it was impossible to talk between the east and west banks of the river. The chief of staff of the troops wrote a letter of encouragement, along with steel picks, iron chisels, steamed buns, and clothes, and sent them one by one from the rope slide to the west bank, and the people on the west bank began to become active.

With the first small rope slide, all hope for crossing the river was unfolding. Following the first rope slide, the second iron wire came over. The third iron wire came over, the fourth iron wire came over. So the engineers said: People can be ferried over. They used eight strands of iron wire to form a thick rope, one end tied to the rubber boat and hung on the river, and the other end bent into an iron ring and hung on the rope slide. Two ropes were then tied to the iron ring, one left on the east bank and one slid over to the west bank. In this way, using the rope slide, people on both sides pulled the iron ring on the shore, and people on the boat paddled on the water, and people could cross the river by boat. Sure enough, the first trial crossing passed three engineers, the second time passed six people, and the third time passed eight people. Unexpectedly, the people on the fourth crossing, as soon as they left the shore, the boat was capsized by a row of huge waves. Fortunately, the boat was held by the rope slide and was not washed away.

After everyone's research, they simply imitated the method of the Tibetan people and built a large rope slide with thick steel cables. A basket was hung on the rope slide, and people and supplies were placed in the basket. Ropes were also hung above the basket and handed to people on both the east and west banks to pull, so that the basket could travel back and forth across the river.

The large rope slide was set up, but the transport capacity of the rope slide was really too small. The rope slide was more than a hundred meters long, and each time it could only carry three people, while at least seven or eight people were needed on each side to pull the ropes. The hands of the people on both sides were swollen from pulling, and they could only pull dozens of people a day. When would thousands upon thousands of engineering troops and countless materials and supplies be transported across the river?

So people began to imagine again: If a rope slide can be set up, why can't an iron cable bridge be built? Thus, a staff officer designed an iron cable bridge that was one hundred and twenty meters long. Two large iron cables were installed in parallel on the bridge, and countless thick iron wires were suspended along the iron cables. Wooden boards about sixty centimeters wide were laid under the iron wires, and the boards were arranged one by one along the iron cables from the east bank to the west bank, so that people could step on the boards and hold the iron cables to travel back and forth.

The iron cable bridge was erected, and the traffic problems on both sides began to be solved. Although the bridge often vibrated with people's footsteps or swayed with the river wind, it was indeed a very good transportation line, and it closely connected the east and west banks.

The rapids of the Nu River were conquered by the heroes. The Kangzang Highway is victoriously extending westward.

    横渡怒江
    贺笠
    由昌都南行，越过邦达草原，在高耸入云的唐古拉山和怒山之间，有一道曲折深邃的山峡，峡底有一条咆哮奔腾的河流，这就是怒江了。
    一九五三年七月，那正是洪水季节，怒江的流水更加震怒了。水的流速达到每秒八立方公尺，水深达到几十公尺，汹涌的波涛冲击着两岸的峭壁。江东江西的藏民被这条险恶的江水长期分隔着。
    但是，我们的公路线必须通过这里，筑路部队的先遣队沿着邦达草原下到怒江东岸来了。先遣队除了随身带的一只橡皮船外，再没有什么渡河的工具了。河里是否可以下船呢？一个测量人员说：现在的江水急而且冷，无法测量，我们可以拿一只狗去试试，如果狗能浮水不沉，橡皮船就可以过河，狗如果下沉，橡皮船也就不能过河。当即牵来一只狗，放下河里，谁知狗一下河即被洪水卷沉江底。
    怎么办呢？英雄决不能向困难低头，他们决定先用空船试渡，在船头系了一根铁丝，以控制船的行动。
    战士们把橡皮船抬到江边，不料刚一下水，船就被巨浪急卷而下，这时铁丝正挂在一块石头上，
  “拍”的一声铁丝断了，橡皮船好像脱缰的野马一般往下飞驰。橡皮船！这只全军唯一的渡河工具，怎么能让冲走呢？
      “必须把它追回！”
    战士群中突然跳出李文炎、崔锡明等三个同志，立刻沿着江岸往下急追，他们逢山爬山，逢崖跳崖，一直追了八里到了一个山头上，这时发现橡皮船正在离岸约有二十多公尺的回水处打漩，而下面却是一段无法跳得下去的峭壁。正在为难的时候，忽见山顶来了一个藏民带有绳子，他们就向藏民借来绳子，一个一个地吊下江边。李文炎首先脱下衣服跳入江中，并说：“同志们，你们准备好，如果我牺牲了，你们也不能让这只船冲跑！”
    虽然已是七月天气，但由于山高谷深，河水冰冷刺骨，李文炎全身都在发麻。但他不顾一切，使出全身气力，劈开巨浪，猛力向船扑去，终于抓住了将要被浪头卷去的小船，脱出漩涡，浮回江岸。这时李文炎刚露出胜利的微笑，还没有来得及说话突然精神松弛，昏倒在地，全身上下都已发青，岸上同志立刻替他擦干身体，穿上衣服，待他慢慢苏醒过来，三人又抬着船返回部队。
    船只已经追回来了，但河还是过不去。部队开到这里已经是十来天了，怎么办呢？于是部队的参谋长决定派副排长崔锡明挑选几位勇敢坚强而又会浮水的同志，坐船抢渡怒江。崔锡明就挑选出李文炎、牛武孝等五人，连同自己共六人，在船上牵着铁丝，准备过河之后，作为搭溜索之用。上船时大家全都脱去衣服，准备船翻时浮水。
    橡皮船向江心进发了，不料刚一离岸，铁丝又挂到江岸的石头上不能前进，人们立刻返回东岸，换上电线绳继续进发，不料到了江心，电线又被洪水冲断了，这时橡皮船被巨浪冲击着，顺流直下。李文炎大叫：“加油划呵，这是最后的一关了！”于是大家都奋力划船，终于使船身冲破了急流，胜利地到达西岸。渡河的局面打开了。
    但是，如何使整个筑路大军都能渡到西岸呢？这个问题是多么复杂啊！不要说引渡全军，连这六个人吃的穿的都还留在东岸无法运送过来。这时天已薄暮，怒江的晚风从峡谷中阵阵吹来，刺得勇士不禁打战，六个人只得身靠身围在一起度过寒夜。东岸的同志为了给西岸送衣送食，第二天便用两根木桩，扎成木筏拴上一条八号铁索放入江心，让西岸同志乘船到江中来接。这样，由于木筏已被洪水冲到江心，西岸的同志就省力了。
    第一根铁索拉过来了，他们就利用地形，在两岸打下钢钎，东高西低地架起第一根小小的溜索。这时由于江水轰鸣，江东江西无法通话，部队参谋长就写了一封勉励的信，连同钢镐、铁铣、蒸馍、衣服，一件一件地从溜索上送到江西，西岸的人们就开始活跃起来了。
    有了第一根小溜索，一切过河的希望都展开了。顺着第一根溜索，第二根铁丝过来了。第三根铁丝过来了，第四根铁丝过来了。于是工程人员说：可以渡人了。他们用八股铁丝组成一根粗绳，一端拴着橡皮船吊在江上，一端弯成一个铁圈，挂在溜索上面。在铁圈上再系上两根绳子，一根留在江东，一根溜过江西，这样利用溜索，两岸的人在岸上拉铁圈，船上的人在水上划，人就可以坐船渡江了，果然第一次试渡，过去了三个工兵，第二次过了六人，第三次过了八人。不料第四次渡河的人，刚一离岸，船就被一排巨浪打翻了，幸而船有溜索挂住，未被冲跑。
    经过大家研究，索性仿照藏民的办法，用粗钢绳搭成一根大溜索。在溜索上挂一个篓子，人和用品都装在篓子内。篓子上面也挂上绳索分交东西两岸用人拉，这样篓子就可以往来江上了。
    大溜索架起来了，但溜索的运输力实在太小。溜索长达百余公尺，每次只能过三个人，而两岸拉绳的人，一边至少也要七、八个人。两岸的人把手都拉肿了，一天拉的也不过几十个人。成千成万的工程部队，无数的料具、给养，要什么时候才可以运得过河呢？
    于是人们又开始设想：溜索可以架起来，为什么又不可以架一座铁索桥呢？这样，一个参谋同志就设计了一座长达一百二十公尺的铁索桥。桥上平行装置两根大铁索，沿铁索吊下无数粗铁丝，在铁丝下面搭上宽约六十公分的木板，一块一块的木板沿着铁索从东岸一直排到西岸，这样人们就可以踏上木板，把着铁索，东西来往了。
    铁索桥架起来了，两岸的交通问题开始解决了。虽然这座桥常是随着人的脚步而震荡，或是随着江风而摇晃，但它究竟是一条很好的交通线，它把东西两岸紧密地联系起来了。
    怒江的急流被英雄们战胜了。康藏公路胜利地向西延伸着。
