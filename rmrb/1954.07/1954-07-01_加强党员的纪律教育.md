    Strengthen Party Members' Discipline Education
    Hong Yu
    Cultivating a communist party member's conscious discipline is an important ideological task of the Party. It is one of the means to strengthen the Party's unity and unification, and also an important condition for realizing the general task of the transition period.
    The Party's discipline is based on Marxist-Leninist theory about the Party, formulated to ensure the victory of class struggle and protect the common interests of the Party and the working people. It is what every Communist Party member must abide by in their words and actions. Without Party discipline, the Party's unity and unification cannot be maintained, the Party's political and organizational lines are difficult to implement, and the great ideals of socialism and communism cannot be realized. Therefore, we must oppose any phenomena that undermine Party discipline and strengthen Party discipline education.
    The Party is a unified fighting organization bound together by discipline that all members must equally abide by. The Party's unity is the decisive condition for the victory of the Chinese people's revolution. "The strength of the Chinese Communist Party lies in its strong unity, unified will, and consistent action." (General Program of the Constitution of the Communist Party of China) Therefore, in our Party, absolutely no violations of discipline are allowed. For example, violating the Party program and constitution, not implementing the Party's policies and resolutions, engaging in sectarian activities, and engaging in duplicitous behavior, and not accepting the supervision of the Party organization are not allowed. The Party Central Committee emphasized in the resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee: If one evades the Party organization and the Central Committee to carry out personal or small group political activities, and evades the Party organization and the Central Committee to spread personal or small group political opinions, this is an illegal activity within the Party, a violation of Party discipline, and an activity that undermines Party unity, which must be opposed and prohibited. The Party Central Committee also specifically stipulated in this resolution: criticism and struggle should be carried out against any words and actions that harm the Party's unity. All Party members and Party organizations at all levels must strictly implement this provision of the Party Central Committee.
    The necessity of consolidating and strengthening Party discipline is, as Lenin and Stalin taught us: on the one hand, because our Party must lead the entire working class and the broad masses of working people to wage a life-and-death struggle with all kinds of class enemies, and this struggle itself requires the Party to have a unified will, unified action, and iron discipline. On the other hand, it is because in the environment of class struggle, the Party and the working class are inevitably connected with the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie in countless ways, and the thoughts and emotions of these classes often invade the ranks of the working class and the Party, causing phenomena such as liberalism, individualism, cowardice and vacillation, division and sabotage in the weak parts of the working class and the Communist Party, which corrode the Party's unity and unification; only by implementing the strictest democratic centralism and iron discipline within the Communist Party can we resist the erosion of various non-proletarian, especially bourgeois, ideologies and styles of work, and truly realize the Party's role as the vanguard of the working class and the organizer and leader of all working people.
    What does the Party's discipline rely on to maintain and consolidate itself? To this question, Lenin answered: "First, it is due to the consciousness of the vanguard of the proletariat, its loyalty to the revolution, its firmness, self-sacrifice and heroism. Second, it is due to its ability to connect with the broadest masses of working people—first of all with the working masses of proletarians, but also with the working masses of non-proletarians—to approach, and to some extent even to merge with them. Third, it is due to the correctness of the political leadership implemented by this vanguard, the correctness of its political strategy and tactics, while at the same time ensuring that the broadest masses can confirm its correctness based on their own experience." ("'Left-Wing' Communism: an Infantile Disorder") Without these conditions, a truly iron discipline within the proletariat cannot be achieved.
    Under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese Communist Party has victoriously experienced the severe tests of various revolutionary historical periods, proving that it fully possesses the above three conditions. The will and action within the Party are unified, and the discipline is strict. Although tendencies of some Party members towards being unorganized and undisciplined and violating Party spirit have occurred in history, they have all been corrected under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, thus enabling the Party's cause to develop smoothly and victoriously complete the great task of the new democratic revolution.
    Now, our Party and country are in a period of transition for socialist transformation. The Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party pointed out: to build our country into a great socialist country is a more profound and broader revolution than the new democratic revolution, which contains extremely complex and acute struggles. On the one hand, foreign imperialism will never sit idly by; on the other hand, those classes that have been overthrown domestically will never be reconciled to their demise, and those classes that will be eliminated will never be without resistance. The resolute counter-revolutionaries among them will inevitably collude with foreign imperialism to undermine the cause of our Party and people, attempting to make the Chinese revolution fail and restore reactionary rule in China. Our Party is still adopting a policy of alliance with the bourgeoisie, and the petty bourgeoisie still surrounds us like a vast ocean; our Party is large, and the Marxist-Leninist education within the Party is still far from enough, and the ideological and political situation among some cadres is still quite complex; some cadres, and even some high-ranking cadres, still do not have sufficient understanding of the importance of Party unity, the importance of collective leadership, and the importance of consolidating and improving the authority of the Central Committee; especially after the victory of the new democratic revolution, a kind of extremely dangerous pride is growing among some cadres in the Party, exaggerating the role of individuals, emphasizing personal prestige, unable to accept criticism and supervision, suppressing and retaliating against critics, and even regarding the regions and departments they lead as personal capital and independent kingdoms, and so on. Under these circumstances, in order to better maintain and strengthen the Party's unity and unification, so that our Party can more powerfully lead the broad masses of workers and peasants to victoriously carry out the socialist revolution struggle, conducting broad and in-depth Party discipline education for all Party members is of more urgent significance.
    History proves that whenever there is a sharp turn in the revolution, there will often be some ideological confusion within the Party, and some people who seriously violate discipline and even waver and defect. At this time, strengthening the Party's ideological education and discipline education is particularly important. When our Party transitioned from the Second Domestic Revolutionary War to the War of Resistance Against Japan, the "Zhang Guotao Incident" occurred. At that time, Comrade Mao Zedong instructed us in his report at the Sixth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee of the Party, he said:
      "In view of Zhang Guotao's serious violation of discipline, it is necessary to reiterate the Party's discipline: (1) The individual is subordinate to the organization; (2) The minority is subordinate to the majority; (3) The lower level is subordinate to the higher level; (4) The entire Party is subordinate to the Central Committee. Whoever violates these disciplines destroys the Party's unity. Experience proves that some people who violate discipline do so because they do not understand what Party discipline is; some who knowingly violate the law, such as Zhang Guotao, take advantage of the ignorance of many Party members to achieve their evil intentions. Therefore, it is necessary to educate Party members about Party discipline, so that not only can general Party members abide by discipline, but also general Party members can supervise the Party's leading figures to abide by discipline together, to avoid the recurrence of the Zhang Guotao incident. In order to put Party relations on the right track, in addition to the above four most important disciplines, it is also necessary to formulate a more detailed set of internal Party regulations to unify the actions of leading organs at all levels."
    Comrade Mao Zedong's instruction still has extremely realistic guiding significance for the current situation in our Party.
    It should be pointed out that the one-sided view that underestimates the role of Party discipline, believing that it is only for restriction and restraint, or only plays a role of restriction and restraint, is incorrect. Party discipline is conscious and active discipline. It requires every Party member to consciously and voluntarily make all their words and actions conform to the will and interests of the Party and the people; it requires every Party member to serve the people wholeheartedly and complete tasks as well as possible. Therefore, it not only stipulates what we cannot do in this way or that, but also stipulates what we should and must do in this way or that. That is to say, it is not only a restriction and restraint on a certain wrong behavior of Party members, but also a promotion and encouragement of a certain virtue of Party members. For behaviors that harm the interests of the Party and the people, Party discipline is compulsory and does not grant freedom. Party discipline is precisely to bind the "personality" of liberals and individualists. But for all beautiful virtues, Party discipline gives the greatest freedom, because this freedom is beneficial to the Party and the people. The Party cultivates and develops the communist moral qualities and excellent personality of every Party member.
    At present, from the perspective of the entire Party, the vast majority of Party members can consciously abide by Party discipline, and Party organizations at all levels generally enforce Party discipline seriously, so Party discipline is basically consolidated. But on the other hand, in some Party members, there are indeed phenomena of lax discipline and impure thoughts, such as not obeying the decisions of the Party organization and haggling over personal gains and losses; not seriously implementing the Party's resolutions and policies and adopting a duplicitous attitude; being perfunctory and procrastinating in Party work; concealing the truth from the Party's higher-level organizations, making false reports, exaggerating achievements, and covering up mistakes; developing individualism, decentralism, and sectarianism; exaggerating the role of individuals, promoting personal worship, and even carrying out illegal activities within the Party, and so on. Some of these people are politically motivated, some are eroded by bourgeois individualistic ideas; and some relatively high-ranking cadres believe that Party discipline is only for "ordinary Party members" and has no binding force on them, believing that they can do whatever they want by relying on their "seniority"; of course, there are also many comrades who are indeed naive and ignorant of Party discipline. But no matter what the reason, these violations of discipline are detrimental to the cause of the Party and the people. It is also wrong to adopt a liberal and indulgent attitude towards violations of discipline. Therefore, consolidating Party discipline and conducting Party discipline education has become an indispensable task in the current ideological work of the Party. Party discipline and discipline education can not only help overcome the above-mentioned violations of discipline, but also help Party members develop positive and perfect political qualities. It must be made clear to all Party members that there is only one discipline in the Party, and whether ordinary Party members or leaders are bound by it without exception; if Party discipline cannot be implemented, the Party's unity and unification cannot be maintained, and the victory of the socialist revolution cannot be guaranteed.
    Therefore, in order to realize the Party's general task put forward during the transition period and seriously implement the resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Party on strengthening the Party's unity, Party organizations at all levels should pay close attention to maintaining and consolidating Party discipline, and continuously strengthen broad and in-depth Party discipline education for all Party members.

    加强党员的纪律教育
    洪禹
    培养共产党员自觉的纪律性，是党的一项重要思想工作。它是加强党的团结和统一的手段之一，同时也是实现过渡时期总任务的重要条件。
    党的纪律是以马克思列宁主义关于党的学说为根据，为了保证阶级斗争的胜利和保护党和劳动人民的共同利益而制定的。它是每一个共产党员的言论和行动都必须遵守的。离开党的纪律，党的团结和统一就不能保持，党的政治路线和组织路线就难以贯彻，而社会主义和共产主义的伟大理想也就无从实现。因此，必须反对任何破坏党的纪律的现象，加强党的纪律教育。
    党是以一切党员都要同样遵守的纪律所结合起来的统一的战斗组织。党的统一是中国人民革命胜利的决定性条件。“中国共产党的力量，在于自己的坚强团结、意志统一、行动一致。”（中国共产党党章总纲）所以在我们党内，绝对不容许有违反纪律的现象存在，例如违反党纲党章，不执行党的政策和决议，进行宗派活动以及阳奉阴违的两面行为、不受党组织的监督等，都是不能容许的。党中央在七届四中全会的决议中曾着重指出：如果避开党的组织和避开中央来进行个人的或小集团的政治活动，避开党的组织和避开中央来散布个人或小集团的政治意见，这在党内就是一种非法活动，就是违反党的纪律、破坏党的团结的活动，就必须加以反对和禁止。党中央在这个决议中还特别规定：对于任何损害党的团结的言论和行动，应该进行批评和斗争。任何党员和各级党的组织，都必须严格执行党中央这个规定。
    巩固和加强党的纪律之所以必需，正像列宁和斯大林所教导我们的：一方面，是因为我们的党要率领整个工人阶级和广大劳动人民去和各式各样的阶级敌人作你死我活的斗争，这种斗争本身要求党具有统一的意志、统一的行动和铁的纪律。另一方面，是因为在阶级斗争的环境中，党和工人阶级不可免地要和资产阶级、小资产阶级发生千丝万缕的联系，而这些阶级的思想和情绪往往侵入到工人阶级和党的队伍中来，在工人阶级和共产党的薄弱部分引起自由涣散、个人主义、怯懦动摇、分裂破坏等腐蚀党的团结和统一的现象；只有在共产党内部实行最严格的民主集中制和铁的纪律，才能抵制各种非无产阶级、特别是资产阶级的思想作风的侵蚀，才能真正实现党作为工人阶级和全体劳动人民的组织者和领导者的先锋队的作用。
    党的纪律，是靠什么东西来维持和巩固的呢？对于这个问题，列宁回答道：“第一，是由于无产阶级先锋队底觉悟性，它对革命的忠实心，它的坚毅性，自我牺牲精神和英勇气概。第二，是由于它善于与最广大劳动群众——首先是与无产者劳动群众，但同样也与非无产者劳动群众——联系，接近，在某种程度上甚至可以说是与他们溶成一片。第三，是由于这先锋队所实现的政治领导正确，由于它的政治战略与策略正确，同时须使最广大群众都能根据本身经验来确信其正确。”（“共产主义运动中的‘左派’幼稚病”）如果没有这些条件，那末，无产阶级内部真正铁的纪律是不能实现的。
    中国共产党在党中央和毛泽东同志的正确领导下，胜利地经历了各个革命历史时期的严重考验，证明它是充分具备了上述三个条件的。党内的意志和行动是统一的，纪律是严明的。虽然在历史上也曾发生过部分党员无组织无纪律等违反党性的倾向，但都在党中央和毛泽东同志的领导下得到了纠正，因而使党的事业得以顺利发展，胜利完成了新民主主义革命的伟大任务。
    现在，我们党和国家正处在社会主义改造的过渡时期。党的七届四中全会指出：要把我国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义国家，这是一个比新民主主义革命更深刻更广泛的革命，它包含着极复杂极尖锐的斗争。一方面，外国帝国主义决不会袖手旁观；另一方面国内那些已被打倒的阶级决不会甘心于自己的死亡，那些将被消灭的阶级也决不会没有反抗，他们中的坚决反革命分子必然要和外国帝国主义相互勾结起来，破坏我们党和人民的事业，企图使中国革命事业归于失败，使反动统治在中国复辟。我们党现在还采取着和资产阶级联合的政策，小资产阶级还像汪洋大海似地包围着我们；我们的党很大，党内的马克思列宁主义的教育还很不够，一部分干部中的思想政治情况还相当复杂；一部分干部甚至某些高级干部对于党的团结的重要性、集体领导的重要性、巩固和提高中央威信的重要性还认识不足；特别是在新民主主义革命胜利之后，党内一部分干部滋长着一种极端危险的骄傲情绪，夸大个人的作用，强调个人的威信，不能接受批评和监督，对批评者实行压制和报复，甚至把自己所领导的地区和部门看作个人的资本和独立王国，等等。在这种情况下，为了更好地保持和加强党的团结和统一，以便使我们的党能够更强有力地率领广大工农群众胜利地进行社会主义革命斗争，对全体党员进行广泛而深入的党的纪律教育，就具有更加迫切的意义。
    历史证明，每当革命急遽转变的关头，党内往往会出现一些思想混乱的现象，出现一些严重破坏纪律以至于动摇变节的人。在这种时候，加强党的思想教育和纪律教育就显得特别重要。当我们党从第二次国内革命战争转入抗日战争的时候，就出现过“张国焘事件”，当时毛泽东同志在党的六届六中全会的报告中就是这样指示我们的，他说：
      “鉴于张国焘严重地破坏纪律的行为，必须重申党的纪律：（一）个人服从组织；（二）少数服从多数；（三）下级服从上级；（四）全党服从中央。谁破坏了这些纪律，谁就破坏了党的统一。经验证明：有些破坏纪律的人，是由于他们不懂得什么是党的纪律；有些明知故犯的人，例如张国焘，则利用许多党员的无知以售其奸。因此，必须对党员进行有关党的纪律的教育，既使一般党员能遵守纪律，又使一般党员能监督党的领袖人物也一起遵守纪律，避免再发生张国焘事件。为使党内关系走上正轨，除了上述四项最重要的纪律外，还须制定一种较详细的党内法规，以统一各级领导机关的行动。”
    毛泽东同志这一指示，对于今天我们党内的情况说来，仍然有着极其现实的指导意义。
    应当指出，那种低估党的纪律的作用，认为它只是为了限制和约束，或者仅仅起限制和约束作用的片面观点是不正确的。党的纪律是自觉的、积极的纪律。它要求每一个党员自觉、自愿地使自己的一切言论和行动符合于党和人民的意志和利益；要求每一个党员全心全意为人民服务，尽可能把任务完成得更好。因此，它不仅规定着我们不可以这样或那样，同时也规定着我们应该和必须这样或那样。也就是说，它不仅是对党员的某种错误行为的限制和约束，同时也是对党员的某种德行的发扬和鼓励。对损害党和人民的利益的行为来说，党的纪律是带有强制性的，是不给予自由的。党的纪律正是要束缚自由主义者和个人主义者的“个性”。但对于一切优美的德行来说，党的纪律却给以最大的自由，因为这种自由是有利于党和人民的。党培养和发扬每一个党员的共产主义的道德品质和优良个性。
    目前，从全党来说，绝大多数的党员都是能自觉地遵守党的纪律的，各级党组织执行党的纪律一般是严肃的，因而党的纪律基本上是巩固的。但是另一方面，在某些党员中间，的确还存在着纪律松弛和思想不纯的现象，例如不服从党组织的决定，斤斤计较个人的得失；对党的决议、政策不认真执行，采取阳奉阴违的态度；对待党的工作马马虎虎、因循敷衍；对党的上级组织隐瞒真相，作假报告，夸大成绩，掩盖错误；发展个人主义、分散主义、宗派主义；夸大个人的作用，宣扬个人崇拜，甚至在党内进行非法活动等等。这些人有的是政治上别有用心，有的是受资产阶级个人主义思想的侵蚀；并且有些比较高级的干部认为党的纪律只是为“普通党员”而定的，对于他们没有约束力，认为依靠他们的“老资格”就可以畅所欲为；当然，也还有不少同志的确是由于幼稚，对党的纪律无知。但不论由于哪一种原因，这些违反纪律的现象都是不利于党和人民的事业的。对违反纪律的现象采取自由主义和纵容姑息的态度也是错误的。因此，巩固党的纪律和进行党的纪律教育，就成为目前党的思想工作中一项不容忽视的任务。党的纪律和纪律教育，不但可以帮助克服上述各种违反纪律的现象，还可以帮助党员养成正面的完美的政治品质。必须使一切党员都懂得：党只有一个纪律，不论普通党员或领导人都毫无例外地要受它的约束；如果党的纪律不能贯彻，就不能保持党的团结和统一，也就不能保证社会主义革命的胜利。
    因此，为了实现党提出的过渡时期的总任务和认真执行党的四中全会关于增强党的团结的决议，党的各级组织应当密切注意保持和巩固党的纪律，并且不断加强对全体党员进行广泛而深入的党的纪律教育。
