　　The planting area of sesame and peanuts in Henan Province this year has expanded by about 300,000 mu compared to last year. Currently, farmers in various regions are working hard to increase the unit area yield of these oil crops. Zhengzhou, Xinxiang and other special districts plan to increase the unit area yield of peanuts by 15 to 21 percent compared to last year. The Huanghe Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yuanfang Township, Kaifeng County, achieved a large-scale peanut harvest last year, averaging 200 jin per mu. This year, they aim to increase the unit area yield of peanuts by 20 percent on top of last year's yield. The entire cooperative planted 520 mu of peanuts this year, with 470 mu treated with rhizobium bacteria inoculation. Each mu was also fertilized with 1,500 jin of fertilizer. The sesame seedlings planted by farmers in Xinyang, Nanyang, Shangqiu and other special districts, covering more than 4.5 million mu, have already grown to four or five inches high. Various regions are using mutual aid cooperation networks and committees to exchange experiences and management techniques for increasing oil crop production. Many agricultural production cooperatives have adjusted their labor organization, assigning the tasks of weeding and thinning oil crops to the most skilled individuals. Some agricultural production cooperatives have also divided the oil crop land into work zones, implementing a contract system and conducting production competitions. In Wuzhi County, more than 75,000 mu of oil crops have been hoed once or twice. In Nanyang Special District, farmers promptly loosen the soil (shallow hoeing) after rainfall to preserve moisture in the sesame fields.
　　Jiangsu Province plans to utilize mountainous land on both sides of the Yangtze River to plant 100,000 mu of oil tea. To ensure the successful completion of this work, the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry dispatched forestry cadres in early July to oil tea producing areas in Zhejiang and Jiangxi to understand the methods of oil tea cultivation, management, and processing. At the same time, cadres were sent to Jiangning, Lishui, Jurong, Dantu and other places planning to develop oil tea to investigate the specific conditions of mountainous area, soil, climate, rainfall, and labor force.

　　Oil tea is an evergreen small tree, and its seeds can be pressed for oil, which is a good edible oil and can also be used as industrial lubricating oil and pharmaceutical raw materials. The wood can be used to make farm tools, and the tea seed cake can be used as fertilizer and has insecticidal effects. After ten years of growth, this batch of oil tea will produce 10 million jin of oil annually in Jiangsu Province, and mountain farmers can also increase their income by more than 40 billion yuan.

    河南农民努力提高油料作物单位面积产量
    江苏计划利用山地种植油茶十万亩
    河南省今年芝麻和花生的种植面积，比去年约扩大了三十万亩。目前各地农民正努力提高这些油料作物的单位面积产量。郑州、新乡等专区花生单位面积产量计划比去年提高百分之十五到二十一。开封县袁坊乡黄河农业生产合作社去年获得花生大面积丰收，平均每亩收二百斤，今年花生单位面积产量要求在去年基础上增产二成。全社今年播种五百二十亩花生，有四百七十亩经过根瘤菌拌种，每亩并施肥一千五百斤。信阳、南阳、商邱等专区农民播种的四百五十万多亩芝麻，苗已长到四、五寸高。各地正运用互助合作网、互助合作委员会等形式，交流油料作物的增产经验和管理技术。许多农业生产合作社调整劳动组织，把油料作物的锄地、间苗等工作分配给技术最好的人去做。有些农业生产合作社还对油料作物地划分作业区，实行包工制，开展生产竞赛。武陟县七万五千多亩油料作物已锄过一遍到两遍。南阳专区每当落雨之后，农民都对芝麻地及时进行松土（浅锄）保墒。（新华社）
    江苏省计划在长江两岸利用山地种植油茶十万亩。为了保证这一工作的胜利完成，该省农林厅已在七月上旬派遣林业干部，分赴浙江、江西产油茶地区，了解有关油茶的培养抚育、管理加工等办法；同时又派出干部分赴准备发展油茶的江宁、溧水、句容、丹徒等地勘察了解山地面积、土壤、气候、雨量及劳动力等具体情况。
    油茶是一种常绿小乔木，种子可以榨油，是一种很好的食用油料，并可做工业上的滑润油和医药的原料，木材可制农具，茶子可做肥料，并有杀虫作用。这批油茶经过十年生长后，江苏全省每年可产油一千万斤，山区农民亦可因此增加四百余亿元的收入。　（李国纬）
