    Graduates of East China Higher Institute of Technology Complete Production Internships
    Graduating students from various higher industrial schools in East China have completed their production internships in many factories, enterprises, and basic construction sites in Shanghai. In this year's production internship, most graduating students directly participated in production operations and practical work as assistants to foremen, section chiefs, shift engineers, and others. Twenty-one students from the Metalworking Tool Specialization of Zhejiang University operated seventeen machine tools allocated by the Shanghai Tool Factory, thereby gaining a more practical understanding of machine tool performance, processing steps, and technological regulations. Shen Zhongmin, a student from the Generator and Motor Specialization of Jiaotong University, originally believed that electricity flow was extremely fast and difficult to control, and felt somewhat timid. This time, after personally operating in the power distribution room of the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company's power plant, he initially became familiar with important skills such as low-voltage switches, scientific patrol inspections, and motor paralleling, greatly strengthening his confidence in participating in power plant operation work in the future. Many students from the Power Plant Repair Specialization of Nanjing Institute of Technology operated under the specific guidance of veteran workers in the boiler room of the Zhabei Power Plant, and were able to maintain stable pressure and temperature inside the boiler, reducing coal consumption and increasing efficiency. Some students also put forward rationalization proposals during their participation in practical work. Zhang Anqi, a student from the Industrial and Civil Architecture Specialization of Zhejiang University who interned at the Pudong 301 construction site, discovered that workers could not use a mortar box when building the brick wall between two window sills, and the operation was very slow. He suggested using lightweight hollow bricks, pre-fabricating a complete wall in the factory, and then hoisting it onto the construction site for installation at once. This not only increases efficiency but also saves materials. This suggestion has been adopted by the Shanghai Municipal People's Government Construction Engineering Bureau. Students from the Industrial and Civil Architecture Specialization of Tongji University interned at the school's construction site. Seeing that there was a lot of rain this summer, which affected the progress of the project, they actively tried to find solutions. Student Chen Tinghong also proposed drawings and detailed written instructions for construction during the rainy season. When students from the Metalworking Tool Specialization of Zhejiang University interned at the Shanghai Tool Factory, they cooperated with the factory's technical innovation campaign, worked with the workers to research, and put forward fifteen rationalization proposals. They also helped the Shanghai Tool Factory to trial-design seven new products in a very short time.
    This production internship generally started in early June and ended in mid-July, lasting six weeks. At present, the internship students from various schools have returned to school one after another after the completion of their internships, preparing to accept various construction tasks assigned by the state.

    华东高等工业学校毕业生已完成生产实习
    华东区各高等工业学校应届毕业生已在上海许多工厂、企业、基本建设工地完成了生产实习。在今年的生产实习中，应届毕业生大多以工长、工段长、值班工程师等的助手身份直接参加生产操作和实际工作。浙江大学金工工具专修科二十一个学生在上海工具厂拨给的十七部机床上进行操作，因而对于机床性能、加工步骤和工艺规程有了比较实际的了解。交通大学发电厂电机专修科学生沈忠民原来认为电力流转极快，不易操纵，心里有些胆怯。这次在闸北水电公司电厂配电间实地动手操作后，初步熟悉了低压开关、科学巡回检查、电机并车等重要技能，大大坚定了将来参加电厂运行工作的信心。南京工学院动力厂检修专修科许多学生在闸北电厂锅炉间老工人的具体指导下进行操作，能保持锅炉内气压气温稳定，使煤耗减小，效率提高。有些学生还在参加实际工作期间，提出了合理化建议。在浦东三零一工地实习的浙江大学工业与民用建筑专修科学生张安祺发现工人砌两扇窗台之间的砖墙时不能用拖灰器，操作很慢，建议运用份量较轻的空心砖，先在工厂中做好完整的一块墙，然后再在工地上吊上去，一次就安装好。这样，不仅效率高，而且节省工料。这一建议已经为上海市人民政府建筑工程局采纳。同济大学工业与民用建筑专修科学生在本校工地实习，看到今年夏季雨水很多，影响工程进行，就积极想办法，学生陈庭洪并提出雨季施工的图样和详细书面说明。浙江大学金工工具专修科学生在上海工具厂实习时，配合厂内技术革新运动，和工人一起研究，提出了十五条合理化建议。他们还在很短时间内帮助上海工具厂试行设计了七件新产品。
    这次生产实习，一般从六月初开始，七月中旬结束，前后历时六星期。目前，各校实习学生在实习完毕后已陆续回校，准备接受国家分配的各项建设工作。（新华社）
