    Characteristics of the Constitutions of People's Democratic Countries in Central and Southeastern Europe
    Soviet Union
    La Gudoshnikov
    The birth of the People's Democratic countries in Europe was the result of the struggle of the people against Hitler's aggression and the fascist system, aided by the military actions of the Soviet army. The Soviet army's advance into the territories of many countries in Central and Southeastern Europe saved the people of these countries from being occupied by the United States and Britain, and contained the reactionary forces within these countries, who had attempted to force the people to endure the corrupt bourgeois system together with the imperialists.
    The people of the European countries liberated by the Soviet army, under the leadership of the working class headed by the Communist and Workers' Parties, defeated the reactionary forces in a short historical period, completed the tasks of the democratic revolution, and transitioned to socialist construction.
    The land reforms carried out in these countries shortly after liberation, as well as the confiscation of the property of fascist aggressors and traitors, were the most important measures in preparing for socialist transformation. Subsequently, the gradual nationalization of factories, banks, transportation, etc., concentrated the lifeline of the national economy in the hands of the state. In the course of the revolution, the bourgeois state organs were smashed, and new people's democratic state organs were established. In the people's democratic countries, the dictatorship of the working class based on the fighting alliance of workers and peasants was established.
    The constitutions (fundamental laws) of the people's democratic countries reflect the great revolutionary transformations taking place in these countries, which have embarked on the path of socialist construction. The People's Republics of Central and Southeastern Europe are socialist-type countries, and their constitutions have the following basic characteristics:
    First, they confirm in legislative form the achievements gained by the workers of these countries in the revolutionary struggle and the process of socialist construction. At the same time, the constitutions of the People's Democratic Republics of Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, and Albania mobilize and guide the masses to strive for the complete victory of the socialist system.
    Second, they consolidate the prerequisites and material conditions for the transition to socialism. The people's democratic constitutions confirm the elimination of landlord land ownership, as well as the nationalization of large and medium-sized industries, banks, and transportation. However, since the constitutions of the people's democratic countries reflect the characteristics of the transitional period from capitalism to socialism, the people's democratic countries do not prohibit, but only restrict the activities of private enterprises. This means that during the transition period, the bourgeoisie in urban and rural areas are still preserved, but their exploitative tendencies are restricted by law and the activities of the people's political power organs. At the same time, the scope of private capital activities is limited to agriculture, commerce, and small industries.
    The basis for the further development of the state and the national economy along the socialist path is the socialist-owned national property. The constitutions of the people's democratic countries reflect the path of social development of these countries—the complete elimination of all remnants of the capitalist exploitation system, and the liberation of workers from any exploitation.
    Third, they confirm the political power in society of the workers led by the working class, which realizes state leadership (dictatorship). The constitutions confirm that the People's Republic is the state form of the dictatorship of the working class. The political foundation of the People's Republic is the People's Assembly, that is, the representative organ of state power of the masses of workers. The state power organs of people's democracy are mass organizations that unite all workers. The People's Assembly is composed according to the principle of democratic centralism. It is a state power organ, which in its nature is similar to the Soviet Union's Soviets.
    Fourth, they implement the spirit of socialist internationalism. The constitutions of the people's democratic countries, like the Soviet constitution, are based on the complete equality of all nationalities and races in economic, cultural, and socio-political life.
    Fifth, true democracy. The constitutions confirm the equality of citizens' rights. No conditions or restrictions are attached to the rights and democratic freedoms enjoyed by citizens. There are no qualifications to restrict citizens' political rights. Men and women, long-term residents and temporary residents, educated and uneducated have no difference in rights.
    People's democracy affirms the equality of citizens' rights, but strictly prohibits the use of democratic rights to achieve anti-people purposes. For example, Article 38 of the Constitution of the People's Republic of Albania stipulates: "No citizen may use the rights granted by the Constitution to change the constitutional order of the People's Republic of Albania to achieve its anti-democratic purposes. All such acts shall be deemed illegal and punished according to law." The constitutions of the people's democratic countries protect the interests of the working people from the destruction of various reactionary conspiracies of the old ruling classes and foreign imperialism overthrown by the revolution.
    Finally, the sixth characteristic is not only to proclaim, but also to consolidate the material guarantees of basic civil rights. These constitutions, like the Soviet constitution, are not limited to stipulating the formal rights of citizens, but pay attention to guaranteeing these rights and promoting the means to realize these rights. For example, Article 46 of the Constitution of the People's Republic of Hungary stipulates: "(1) The People's Republic of Hungary guarantees the right of workers to rest... (2) This right shall be realized by the People's Republic of Hungary by stipulating legal working hours, granting paid leave, and organizing workers' sanatoriums and rest homes."
    The democracy of the constitutions of the people's democratic republics is socialist democracy.
    The basic characteristics of the constitutions of the European people's democratic countries listed above are fundamentally different from the bourgeois constitutions, which consolidate social inequality, the system of man exploiting man, the political power of the propertied, and the rule of some nations over others.
    Because the constitutions of the European people's democratic countries have these characteristics, they are similar to the constitutions of the Soviet state.
    In addition, the constitutions of the people's democratic republics, as pointed out above, are constitutions of the transitional period from capitalism to socialism, so they are bound to be different from the current constitution of the Soviet Union, the constitution of a country where socialism has been victorious.
    The main difference is that the people's democratic constitutions allow the existence of private capitalist components in the economy. The people's democratic countries are currently in the stage of development that the Soviet state was in before the elimination of the exploiting classes.
    At the same time, there are some differences between the constitutions of the people's democratic republics and the Soviet constitution, which are caused by the different historical conditions of revolutionary development and socialist construction in the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries.
    The major differences between the Soviet state and the people's democratic countries as the dictatorship of the working class are as follows:
    First, in some people's democratic countries, there are several political parties of the working people, and the Communist and Workers' Parties are the leading forces in the people's democratic countries.
    Second, in the people's democratic countries, there is the people's democratic united front, which is a mass political organization of the workers, used to help the working class and its party to lead the people's democratic society.
    Third, in most people's democratic countries, the exploiters have not been deprived of their right to vote, as the Soviet state did in its first stage of development. However, in all people's democratic countries, war criminals, as well as criminals of treason, anti-people, and counter-revolution, have been deprived of their right to vote.
    The system of individual heads of state currently implemented in Czechoslovakia and recently in Poland is a characteristic of the constitutions of individual European people's democratic countries. The president is elected by a certain supreme state power organ (in Czechoslovakia, by the National Assembly), and at the same time, the president is the supreme commander of the armed forces of the country.
    These differences between the constitutions of the people's democratic countries and the Soviet constitution are not fundamental differences.
    The historical significance of the people's democratic constitutions is great. For the workers of the people's democratic countries, it has the significance of summarizing the preliminary achievements in the struggle for national independence and the transition to socialist construction with the selfless help of the Soviet Union. For the workers of capitalist countries, it directly confirms the possibility and necessity of using the experience of the Soviet people in their struggle for democracy and socialism.

### 中欧和东南欧人民民主国家宪法的特点

    中欧和东南欧人民民主国家宪法的特点苏联
    拉·古多什尼科夫
    欧洲人民民主国家的诞生，乃是在苏军军事行动援助下，人民群众反对希特勒侵略和法西斯制度的斗争的结果。苏军挺进到中欧和东南欧许多国家的领土，挽救了这些国家的人民，免于遭到美、英的占领，并箝制了这些国家内部的反动势力，他们曾企图与帝国主义分子一起，迫使人民忍受腐朽的资产阶级制度。
    由苏军解放了的欧洲各国人民，在以共产党和工人党为首的工人阶级领导下，于很短的历史时期里战胜了反动势力，完成了民主革命阶段的任务，并向社会主义建设过渡。
    这些国家在解放后不久所进行的土地改革，以及对法西斯侵略分子和叛国分子的财产的没收，是准备社会主义改造的最重大的措施。随后逐步实行工厂、银行和运输等等的国有化，这就把国民经济的命脉集中到国家的手里。在革命的进程中，粉碎了资产阶级的国家机关，建立了新的、人民民主的国家机关。在人民民主国家里，确立了以工农战斗联盟为基础的工人阶级的专政。
    人民民主国家的宪法（根本法）反映着已踏上社会主义建设之途的这些国家中所进行的伟大革命改造。中欧和东南欧人民共和国是社会主义类型的国家，其宪法的基本特点如下：
    第一，以立法手续确认了这些国家劳动者在革命斗争和社会主义建设进程中所获得的成就。同时，波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、保加利亚、罗马尼亚以及阿尔巴尼亚各人民民主国家的宪法，动员并指导人民群众去争取社会主义制度获得完全胜利。
    第二，巩固着向社会主义过渡的前提和物质条件。人民民主的宪法确认地主土地所有制的消灭，以及大、中工业、银行和运输的国有化。但是，由于人民民主国家的宪法反映着从资本主义向社会主义过渡的过渡时期的特点，人民民主国家并不禁止，而只是限制私人企业的活动。这就是说，在过渡时期，城市和农村的资产阶级还保存着，但是他们的剥削意向，要受到法律和人民政权机关活动的束缚。同时，私人资本的活动范围仅限于农业、商业和小工业。
    国家和国民经济沿社会主义的途径进一步发展的基础，是具有社会主义性质的全民的国家财产。人民民主国家的宪法，反映着这些国家社会发展的道路——彻底消灭资本主义剥削制度的一切残余，使劳动者摆脱任何剥削的道路。
    第三，确认由实现国家领导（专政）的工人阶级所领导的劳动者在社会上的政权。宪法确认，人民共和国是工人阶级专政的国家形式。人民共和国的政治基础是人民会议，即群众性的劳动者国家权力代表机关。人民民主的国家权力机关是联合一切劳动者的群众性组织。人民会议是依民主集中制原则组成的，它是国家权力机关，按其性质来讲，近似苏联的苏维埃。
    第四，贯彻着社会主义的国际主义的精神。人民民主国家的宪法，与苏联宪法一样，其出发点是各民族、种族在经济、文化和社会政治生活各方面完全平等。
    第五，真正民主主义。宪法确认公民的权利平等。对公民享受的权利和民主自由，不加任何附带条件和限制。不以任何资格来限制公民的政治权利，男性与女性、久居者与暂居者，受过教育者与未受过教育者在权利上没有任何差别。
    人民民主制确认公民的权利平等，但是严禁利用民主权利来达到反人民的目的。如阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国宪法第三十八条规定：“一切公民，均不得利用宪法所给予的权利而变更阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国的宪法秩序，以达其反民主的目的。所有此类行为，均被认为非法，且依法惩处之。”人民民主国家宪法保卫劳动人民的利益，使之不受被革命所推翻的旧社会的统治阶级和外国帝国主义各种反动阴谋的破坏。
    最后，第六个特点，不仅宣布，而且是巩固公民基本权利的物质保障。这些宪法，与苏联宪法一样，不以规定公民的形式权利为限，而注意于保障这些权利和促进实现这些权利的手段。如匈牙利人民共和国宪法第四十六条规定：“（一）匈牙利人民共和国保障劳动者的休息权……。（二）此种权利由匈牙利人民共和国以规定合法工作时间，给予保留原薪的休假及组织劳动者疗养所及休息所的方法实现之。”
    人民民主共和国的宪法的民主制是社会主义的民主制。
    上面所列举的欧洲人民民主国家宪法的基本特点，根本不同于资产阶级的宪法；后者巩固着社会上的不平等、人剥削人的制度、有产者的政权，以及一些民族对另一些民族的统治。
    由于欧洲人民民主国家宪法具有这些特点，它是与苏维埃国家的宪法相近似的。
    此外，人民民主共和国的宪法，如前面所指出的，它是从资本主义到社会主义的过渡时期的宪法，所以它势必同苏联的现行宪法，胜利了的社会主义国家的宪法有所不同。
    主要的区别是人民民主宪法在经济上允许私人资本主义成份存在。人民民主国家现时正处在苏维埃国家在消灭剥削阶级以前所处的那个发展阶段。
    同时，人民民主共和国宪法与苏联宪法还有一些区别，那是由于苏联与人民民主国家的革命发展和社会主义建设的历史条件不同所引起的。
    作为工人阶级专政的苏维埃国家和人民民主国家，二者的重大区别如下：
    第一，在某些人民民主国家中存在有几个劳动人民的政党，而共产党和工人党是人民民主国家的领导力量。
    第二，在人民民主国家中存在有人民民主统一战线，这是劳动者的群众性的政治组织，用以帮助工人阶级及其政党来领导人民民主制的社会。
    第三，在大多数人民民主国家中，没有像苏维埃国家在其第一个发展阶段那样，剥夺了剥削分子的选举权。但在所有人民民主国家中，都剥夺了战犯，以及叛国、反人民和反革命的罪犯的选举权。
    目前捷克斯洛伐克和不久以前波兰所实行的国家的个人元首制，这是个别欧洲人民民主国家宪法的特点。总统是由一定的最高国家权力机关选出的
  （在捷克斯洛伐克由国民会议选出），同时总统是全国武装部队的最高统帅。
    人民民主国家宪法与苏联宪法的这种不同，并不是根本的不同。
    人民民主宪法的历史意义是伟大的。对人民民主国家劳动者讲来，它有着总结在苏联无私帮助下，为民族独立和向社会主义建设过渡而斗争中所获得的初步成就的意义。对资本主义国家的劳动者讲来，它直接证实了，他们在为民主和社会主义而斗争中，运用苏联人民经验的可能和必要。
