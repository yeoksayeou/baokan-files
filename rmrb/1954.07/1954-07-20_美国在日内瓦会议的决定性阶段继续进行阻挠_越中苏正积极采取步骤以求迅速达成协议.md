    Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, July 18th: Our special correspondent Shen Jiantu reports: The first nine-nation delegation meeting after the foreign ministers returned to Geneva will be held on the afternoon of the 18th to resolve the outstanding differences hindering a swift agreement to restore peace in Indochina. The meeting will focus on some fundamental issues, which must be agreed upon in the draft agreement if a lasting solution for lasting peace and the easing of tensions is to be achieved in Geneva.

    As hopes rise here for a swift agreement, observers are closely watching the United States' last-minute actions to obstruct a resolution and sow the seeds of war at the conference. Dulles, in his talks in Paris, attempted to order Britain and France as to what the United States "cannot accept." After the Paris talks, Washington's influence in shackling the Western delegations has become apparent here. The serious test of whether a swift agreement can be reached here is whether the Western delegations can bravely resist the pressure exerted by the United States for its unacceptable demands, which will obstruct a resolution at the last minute.

  There are now signs that the United States wants to fill the draft agreement with loopholes in order to organize Southeast Asian aggressive blocs and prepare for war in the East at will.

    Although Washington verbally favors free elections, it is very afraid of holding elections in Vietnam and hopes to postpone them indefinitely. This is part of the United States' plan to permanently divide Indochina to suit the war planners in the Pentagon. American journalists here openly talk about the United States giving huge amounts of "aid" to "South Vietnam," Laos, and Cambodia in order to turn them into American bases like South Korea.

    Therefore, the U.S. delegation does not like the inclusion of the following clause in the draft declaration of principles for the nine-nation delegation: the nine-nation delegation agrees that the three countries of Indochina shall not participate in military alliances and shall not become foreign military bases. If this clause is deleted, it would greatly facilitate the United States' turning these countries into military bases to further infiltrate Asia. People are closely watching the pressure the United States is exerting on other delegations to delete this clause and to have these three countries participate in the U.S.-dominated Southeast Asian aggressive bloc.

    Upon their return to Geneva, Foreign Ministers Molotov and Zhou Enlai, along with Acting Foreign Minister Pham Van Dong, immediately continued their constructive efforts, busying themselves with one informal contact after another with other foreign ministers in order to reach a swift agreement. Sources here point out that other delegations have not kept pace with this. There is a clear discrepancy between the statements of certain delegations about reaching an agreement before July 20th and their behavior in the negotiations. The facts are as follows:

    On the issue of demarcating the boundaries of regrouping zones, the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam proposed the 13th and 14th parallels, and now, in order to achieve a ceasefire quickly, it has proposed the 16th parallel. The French delegation, however, has not retreated a single step from the 18th parallel.

    On the issue of general elections in Vietnam, the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam originally proposed that the election be held six months after the signing of the agreement. In order to facilitate an early agreement, it has now proposed June 1955 as the date for the election.

    The French delegation originally proposed holding elections 18 months after the ceasefire. But now it has regressed and pushed the election date to a distant and indefinite future.

    The delegations had tacitly agreed in the negotiations that the three countries of Indochina should not participate in military alliances and should not become foreign military bases. After the recent Paris talks, some delegations apparently do not want to put this in writing.

    Before the foreign ministers left Geneva late last month, Foreign Minister Molotov had already put forward two alternative proposals on the issue of the membership of the International Supervisory Commission. Since then, no other delegations have put forward any new proposals.

    In order to reach an agreement on the issues of Laos and Cambodia, the delegations of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, China, and the Soviet Union have put forward compromise solutions based on the characteristics of these two countries. It is reported that some delegations still insist on obliterating the existence of the resistance movements and insist on disarming the people's resistance forces.

    All of this shows that the delegations of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, China, and the Soviet Union have made earnest efforts to reach a swift agreement. If all the delegations make the same efforts to seek an agreement, then it is still possible to reach an agreement on the cessation of hostilities in Indochina and the restoration of peace in Indochina in the coming days. The facts show on which side the "stonewall" hindering the agreement appears. French newspapers reported that the French delegation is waiting for the "final moment," and other Western delegations are also awaiting the final moment.

    Some sections of the Western press, taking advantage of the secrecy of the informal contacts between the foreign ministers, are shifting the responsibility for the stalled negotiations to other delegations. The nine-nation delegation meeting on the 18th will expose the actual situation.

    It is clear that "buying time" at the current decisive stage of the conference is to accommodate the pressure exerted by the United States to delay the conclusion of the agreement desired by the whole world. The delegations of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, China, and the Soviet Union have been and are still taking decisive steps to seek a swift agreement. As a ceasefire and peace in Indochina loom, the whole world is now waiting for other delegations to take the same steps and express the same sincerity in order to reach a swift agreement. The people of the world (especially the French people), who are eagerly awaiting an early ceasefire in Indochina, must now ensure that the Western delegations also take rapid steps toward an agreement.

### 美国在日内瓦会议的决定性阶段继续进行阻挠  越中苏正积极采取步骤以求迅速达成协议

    美国在日内瓦会议的决定性阶段继续进行阻挠
    越中苏正积极采取步骤以求迅速达成协议
   【新华社日内瓦十八日电】本社特派记者沈建图报道：外长们回到日内瓦以后的第一次九国代表团会议，将在十八日下午举行，来解决阻碍迅速达成恢复印度支那和平的协议的没有解决的分歧。会议将集中讨论一些根本问题，如果要在日内瓦取得持久和平和紧张局势缓和的持久解决办法，就必须在协定草案中对这些根本问题达成协议。
    当这里对迅速达成协议所抱的希望增加的时候，观察家们正在密切注视着美国阻挠解决并在会议上种下战争种子的最后一分钟的行动。杜勒斯在巴黎会谈中企图号令英法，哪些是美国“不能接受的”。在巴黎会谈后，华盛顿对西方代表团横加束缚的影响就在这里表现出来了。在这里是否能迅速达成协议的严重考验是：西方各国代表团是否能够勇敢地抵抗美国为它的不可接受的要求而施加的压力，这种要求将在最后一分钟阻挠解决。
  现在有迹象表明，美国想要使协定草案充满漏洞，以便随心所欲地组织东南亚侵略集团和准备东方的战争。
    虽然华盛顿在口头上赞成自由选举，但是它很害怕在越南举行选举，并希望把选举无限期地推迟。这是美国的要使印度支那永远分裂以合乎五角大楼的战争策划者的心意的计划的一部分。这里的美国记者公开谈论美国要给“南越”、老挝和柬埔寨以巨额“援助”，以便把它们变成像南朝鲜那样的美国基地。
    因此，美国代表团不喜欢在九国代表团的原则宣言草案中列入下面这个条款：九国代表团商定印度支那三个国家不得参加军事联盟，不得变成外国军事基地。如果删去这个条款，那就是为美国把这些国家变成军事基地以进一步渗入亚洲大开方便之门。人们正在密切注意美国为了要删去这个条款、为了要这三个国家参加受美国支配的东南亚侵略集团而对其他代表团施加的压力。
    莫洛托夫、周恩来外长一回到日内瓦以后，他们和范文同代外长就立即继续进行建设性的努力，忙着同其他外长进行一次一次的非正式接触，以便迅速达成协议。这里的人士指出，其他代表团并没有跟上这种步伐。某些代表团的在七月二十日前取得协议的言论，同它们在谈判中的行为之间有着明显的距离。事实是这样：
    在划定重新集结区的界线的问题上，越南民主共和国代表团提议的是十三纬度线、十四纬度线，而现在为了迅速取得停火提议十六纬度线了。而法国代表团却没有从十八纬度线退让一步。
    在越南普选的问题上，越南民主共和国代表团原来提议以协定签字后六个月为举行选举的日期。为了促成早日达成协议，它现在已提议以一九五五年六月为举行选举的日期。
    法国代表团原来提议在停战后十八个月举行选举。而现在它已开倒车把选举日期推到遥遥无期的将来了。
    各代表团在谈判中曾默默地同意：印度支那三国不应参加军事联盟，不应成为外国的军事基地。在最近的巴黎会谈以后，某些代表团显然不想把这一点用书面文字写下来了。
    莫洛托夫外长在外长们上月下旬离开日内瓦之前对国际监察委员会的成员问题已提出了两个任择其一的建议。从那时候以来，其他代表团还没有提出过任何新的建议。
    为了在老挝和柬埔寨问题上达成协议，越南民主共和国、中国和苏联的代表团根据这两个国家的特点，提出了折衷的解决办法。据悉，某些代表团仍然坚持要抹杀抗战运动的存在和坚持解除人民抗战部队的武装。
    这一切表明越南民主共和国、中国和苏联的代表团为了迅速达成协议作了认真的努力。如果所有的代表团作出同样的努力来谋求达成协议，那么，在今后几天内就停止印度支那敌对行动和恢复印度支那和平问题达成协议，仍然是可能的。事实表明了阻碍达成协议的“石墙”出现在哪一方面。法国报纸报道说，法国代表团正在等待“最后的时刻”，其他西方代表团也在静候最后的时刻。
    某些部分的西方报纸利用外长们的非正式接触秘密进行的情况，把谈判的搁浅的责任转嫁在其他代表团身上。十八日九国代表团会议将会使实际情况暴露出来。
    很显然，在会议目前的决定性阶段“拖延时间”，是为了要适应美国为拖延全世界盼望的协议的达成而施加的压力。越南民主共和国、中国和苏联的代表团一直在、而且目前仍然在采取决定性步骤以求迅速达成协议。当印度支那的停战和和平隐隐在望的时候，全世界现在都在等待其他的代表团也采取同样的步骤并表示同样的诚意，以迅速达成协议。迫切地等待着印度支那早日停火的全世界人民（特别是法国人民）现在必须做到使西方代表团也迈开迅速的步伐走向协议。
