Health departments of People's Governments in Henan, Sichuan and other Provinces Carry out Mobile Medical Prevention Work during the Busy Farming Season

Currently, it is the busy farming season. Health departments of county and district People's Governments in Henan, Sichuan, Hunan, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Fujian, Anhui, and other provinces have organized mobile medical teams or groups to go deep into the vast rural areas to carry out medical and prevention work.

The Fifth District of Tangyin County, Henan Province, selected seven skilled traditional Chinese medicine practitioners and new medical doctors to form a mobile team. They conduct mobile medical services and supervise and inspect work in various townships. The mobile medical group of the Eighth District of Mi County always explains the patient's condition to the relieving doctor when doctors are rotated within the group. They also use farmers' rest time to carry out health education. The mobile medical group organized by Jintang County, Sichuan Province, went deep into the fields and treated 1,726 farmers in nineteen days. Medical personnel from the Seventh District Mobile Medical Team of Pingjiang County, Hunan Province, climbed mountains and ridges in the hot weather to provide treatment in various townships. They treat many patients every day, and if they cannot finish, they make house calls at night. The four mobile medical groups in the Gushi District of Weinan County, Shaanxi Province, treated 515 people in one day. Some medical groups designated dispensers to collect prescriptions every day to get medicine in the city and deliver the medicine to the farmers' homes. Many farmers reflected: "The People's Government has thought of things we hadn't even thought of!" A township cadre said: "This time, the mobile medical team came to our township and treated a total of 114 people. If these patients had to find doctors to treat their illnesses themselves, each person would have to travel dozens of miles, resulting in a total of 228 missed workdays. How much production would that delay!"

    河南、四川等省的县、区人民政府卫生部门
    开展农忙时期巡回医疗预防工作
    目前正值农忙季节，河南、四川、湖南、山西、陕西、福建、安徽等省的县、区人民政府卫生部门，都组织了巡回医疗队或医疗组，深入广大农村开展医疗预防工作。
    河南省汤阴县五区抽调了七名技术较好的中医和新医组成机动小队，一面进行巡回医疗，一面到各乡进行督促检查工作。密县第八区的巡回医疗组，在小组内医生调换时，都把病人的病情交代给接班的医生，他们并利用农民休息时间展开卫生宣传工作。四川省金堂县组成的巡回医疗组深入田间，在十九天中给一千七百二十六个农民治好了疾病。湖南省平江县七区巡回医疗队的医务人员，在炎热的天气里爬山越岭深入各乡进行治疗。每天诊治病人很多，诊治不完，他们还在晚上出诊。陕西省渭南县固市区的四个巡回医疗组，在一天时间就治疗了五百一十五人。有的医疗组指定调剂员每天收集处方到市区取药，并把药送到农民家里。很多农民反映：人民政府把咱们想不到的事都想到了。有一个乡干部说：这次巡回医疗队来我乡，共诊治一百十四人，如果这些病人自己去找医生治病，每人都得走几十里路，共要误工二百二十八个，这耽误多少生产啊！　　　（新华社）
