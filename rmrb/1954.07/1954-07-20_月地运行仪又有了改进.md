The creator of the lunartellurian, Zhang Junde, has improved the lunartellurian once again. There are twelve relatively important modifications and additions. The improved version can explain three more astronomical phenomena than the original lunartellurian. The newly added "Lunar Phase Disk" can clearly show the changes of the moon during its orbit around the earth. The modified lunartellurian indicates that the period of the lunar-terrestrial movement is much more accurate than the original. At the same time, the base of the instrument can be rotated left and right and fixed, making it more convenient for teaching. The new lunartellurian has been produced by the state-owned Nanjing Scientific Instrument Factory and is named "Type 54 Lunartellurian".

    月地运行仪又有了改进
    月地运行仪的创造者张俊德又一次改进了月地运行仪。较重要的改制和增添有十二处，较原来的月地运行仪能够多说明三种天文现象。新增加的“月相盘”可以清楚地表明月球在绕地球一周的过程中的变化。经改制的月地运行仪表明月地运行的周期比原来的要精确得多，同时，仪器的底座可以左右转动，又能固定，对教学更为方便。新的月地运行仪已由国营南京科学仪器制造厂生产，定名“五四式月地运行仪”。
