Xinhua News Agency report: The first session of the First Chongqing Municipal People's Congress was held from July 23rd to 26th. The 275 deputies attending the meeting solemnly exercised the democratic rights of the people of the city.

With boundless excitement and joy, the deputies warmly discussed the draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China and unanimously passed a resolution endorsing the draft Constitution.

After listening to the report by Luo Shigao, Deputy Mayor of Chongqing, on the "Work Situation in the First Half of 1954 and Work Tasks for the Second Half of the Year," all the deputies attending the meeting conducted a serious and conscientious review and discussion. The deputies agreed with the report and, in response to the shortcomings in the current work, put forward many criticisms and suggestions. When determining the government's work tasks for the second half of this year, the meeting emphasized that major efforts should be focused on doing a good job in industrial production; strengthening leadership over the market, steadily expanding state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce; actively and gradually carrying out socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, agriculture, and handicrafts; and correspondingly strengthening cultural, educational, and political work. All the deputies at the meeting expressed their determination to work together with the people of the city to ensure the completion and overfulfillment of the 1954 national plan.

The deputies expressed their warm support and pledged to do a good job in merging Chongqing into Sichuan Province.

The meeting elected deputies to the National People's Congress and deputies to the Sichuan Provincial People's Congress. The spirit of democracy was fully promoted in the election. All the deputies fully deliberated and discussed the list of deputy candidates proposed through consultation by the Communist Party of China, democratic parties, and people's organizations. During the discussion on the election of deputies to the Sichuan Provincial People's Congress meeting, the meeting accepted a proposal from a representative of the Western medicine community and decided to add one representative from the traditional Chinese medicine community.
