The state-owned commercial departments and supply and marketing cooperatives in Hunan Province are vigorously supplying materials to support the people in areas along the river and around the lake, as well as waterlogged areas, in flood control, waterlogging drainage, and production for disaster relief.

The Commercial Department of the Hunan Provincial People's Government convened an emergency meeting of managers of provincial state-owned commercial companies on June 30 to arrange for supporting the people in various regions to overcome the floods. Currently, the Changsha Branch of the China National Hardware and Machinery Company has prepared over a hundred tons of lead wire and a batch of steel wire, white coir rope, and other flood control and emergency rescue items for supply to the lake areas. At the same time, it is preparing to process and modify a batch of electric water pumps into diesel water pumps for farmers to use for waterlogging drainage. China Salt Company Hunan Branch and China Petroleum Company Changsha Branch have prepared a large number of kerosene, gasoline, edible salt and other goods. The business departments of the province's petroleum company and hardware and machinery company have assigned personnel to work at night, supplying oil and materials needed for flood control and emergency rescue to various places day and night. Supply and marketing cooperatives in Linxiang, Yuanjiang, Nanxian, Leiyang and other counties have promptly supplied a large number of articles needed for flood control and waterlogging drainage. The Linxiang County Supply and Marketing Cooperative has set up seven purchasing points in places with convenient water transportation, vigorously purchasing flood control materials such as rice straw and pilings, and adopting the method of collecting and transporting simultaneously to quickly transport the purchased materials to the flood control dykes. According to incomplete statistics, the Nanxian Supply and Marketing Cooperative has supplied more than 7,500 large and small bamboos and wood, and repaired more than 1,400 waterwheel heads and blades for farmers. After learning that the lakeside embankment of Lingguan Village, Banju Township, was in danger of breaching, the cadres of the First District Supply and Marketing Cooperative of the county, regardless of wind and rain, rushed to transport more than one hundred pieces of timber and a large number of iron wires, fine bamboo strips and other materials overnight. Supply and marketing cooperatives in Changsha City's Western District, Nanxian's Fourth District, and other places have adopted methods such as organizing peddlers to supply a large number of daily necessities such as grain, oil, and salt to the disaster areas.

In order to help farmers in the disaster areas to resume production, supply and marketing cooperatives in various parts of the province have supplied a large number of seeds, fertilizers and farm tools to the disaster areas. The Supply and Marketing Department of the Hunan Provincial Cooperative Federation convened a symposium of more than 20 representatives from the county (city) cooperative federations in the disaster-stricken areas of Hanshou, Huarong, etc., to discuss the supply of seeds for late-season crops. The cooperative also sent cadres to Hankou, Jiujiang and other places to purchase fertilizers; the 30,000 dan of rapeseed cakes recently transported from Hubei have been shipped to the Xiangnan Administrative District and Xiangtan, Shaoyang and other special districts. The Hengshan County Cooperative Federation recently transferred more than 1.5 million jin of fertilizer and 70,000 jin of late rice seeds, giving priority to supplying them to farmers in the disaster areas. In addition to vigorously supplying seeds, fertilizers, and farm tools, the supply and marketing cooperatives in various districts of Linxiang County also pay attention to helping farmers in the disaster areas to sell sideline products such as reed mats and bamboo baskets.

    大力供应物资支持防汛排渍和生产救灾
    湖南省国营商业部门和供销合作社大力供应物资，支持沿江滨湖地区和积水地区人民防汛、排渍，开展生产救灾工作。
    湖南省人民政府商业厅在六月三十日召开省级国营商业公司经理紧急会议，对支持各地人民战胜洪水的工作作了布置。目前，中国五金机械公司长沙分公司已准备了上百吨铅丝和一批钢丝、白棕绳等防汛抢险的物品，供应滨湖地区，同时准备把一批电动水泵加工改制成柴油水泵，供农民用来排渍。中国盐业公司湖南省公司和中国石油公司长沙分公司等已准备了大批煤油、汽油、食盐等货物。该省石油公司和五金机械公司的营业部门抽调人员在夜间值班，白天黑夜供应各地防汛、抢险需用的油料和器材。临湘、沅江、南县、耒阳等县的供销合作社都及时供应了大批防汛、排渍需用的物品。临湘县供销合作社在水运便利的地方设立了七个收购点，大力收购稻草、桩木等防汛器材，并采取边收边运的办法，把收购到的器材迅速运往防汛堤段。据不完全统计，南县供销合作社已供应大小竹木七千五百多根，为农民修理水车车头、车叶一千四百多件。该县第一区供销合作社的干部在知道班咀乡灵官村沿湖堤岸有决口危险的情况后，不顾风雨，连夜赶运去百余根木材和大批铁丝、子篾等器材。长沙市城西区、南县第四区等地的供销合作社采用组织货郎担等办法，到受灾地区供应了大批粮食、油、盐等生活用品。
    为了帮助受灾农民恢复生产，该省各地供销合作社在受灾地区供应了大批种籽、肥料和农具。湖南省合作社联合社供应经理部召集了汉寿、华容等受灾地区的县（市）合作社联合社代表二十余人举行座谈会，讨论了晚种作物种籽的供应问题。该社还派干部到汉口、九江等地采购肥料；最近从湖北运到的三万担菜饼，已运往湘南行政区和湘潭、邵阳等专区。衡山县合作社联合社最近调进一百五十多万斤肥料、七万斤晚稻种，尽先供应给受灾农民。临湘县各区供销合作社除大力供应种籽、肥料、农具外，还注意帮助受灾农民推销芦席、箩筐等副业产品。
