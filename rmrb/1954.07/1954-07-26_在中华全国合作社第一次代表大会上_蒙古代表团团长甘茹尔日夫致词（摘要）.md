    Speech by Ganjuurjab, Head of the Mongolian Delegation (Summary)
    Ganjuurjab, Head of the Mongolian Cooperative Delegation, addressed the First National Congress of Cooperatives of China on the 23rd. Ganjuurjab said: Participating in this congress gives us the opportunity to deeply understand the activities and rich experiences of Chinese cooperatives, which is of great significance for further consolidating the growing friendship and economic and cultural cooperation between the people of Mongolia and China. He said that our country's trade is based on maintaining friendly relations with the great Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, and our cooperatives continuously learn from the Soviet Union and China in their work.
    He said: Under the leadership of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, and thanks to the constant assistance of the Soviet Union, the Mongolian Consumer Cooperatives have greatly developed and consolidated in terms of management and organization during the era of the people's democratic system. Our cooperatives have now united the vast majority of all adults in our country into their ranks. During these years, the capital and experts of the cooperatives have grown significantly. Our consumer cooperatives supply residents with grain and industrial products domestically and procure livestock products to supply the domestic industry and for export.

This year, the purchasing prices of livestock, wool, and other animal products have been greatly increased, and since June 1st this year, the retail prices of industrial products and food have been reduced. Due to the implementation of these measures, the welfare and purchasing power of the rural people have been further improved, and the activities of consumer cooperatives have also expanded dramatically.

    在中华全国合作社第一次代表大会上
    蒙古代表团团长甘茹尔日夫致词（摘要）
    蒙古合作社代表团团长甘茹尔日夫二十三日向中华全国合作社第一次代表大会致词。甘茹尔日夫说：参加这次代表大会使我们有可能深刻地了解中国合作社的活动和丰富的经验，这对于进一步巩固蒙中两国人民的日益发展的友谊和经济、文化的合作，具有重大的意义。他说，我国的贸易是建立在和伟大的苏联和中华人民共和国保持友好关系的基础上，我国合作社在工作中不断地向苏联和中国学习。
    他说：蒙古消费合作社在蒙古人民革命党的领导下，由于苏联的经常帮助，在人民民主制度的年代里，在经营和组织方面已经大大发展和巩固了。我国合作社现在已经把我国全体成年人的绝大多数联合到自己的队伍中来，在这些年代里，合作社的资金和专家有了显著的增长。我国消费合作社在国内以粮食和工业品供给居民，并进行畜产品的采购，以畜产品供给本国工业和出口。
    他说：我们的党和政府不断关怀我国劳动人民福利状况的提高。今年，牲畜、羊毛和其他畜产品的采购价格都大大增加了，从今年六月一日起，降低了工业品和食品的零售价格，由于实行了这些措施，农村人民的福利状况和购买力更加提高了，消费合作社的活动也急剧扩大了。
    甘茹尔日夫说：我国合作社的全体社员，以及全体蒙古人民经常在为中国人民和中国合作社所获得的伟大成就而感到衷心的愉快。
    他说：我衷心希望我们友好的伟大的中国人民的合作社在实现它们的巨大任务方面，获得进一步的更大的成就。
    甘茹尔日夫最后代表蒙古人民共和国消费合作社献给中华全国合作社第一次代表大会几件礼物：一面旗帜，毛泽东同志的肖像以及蒙古的手工艺品。
