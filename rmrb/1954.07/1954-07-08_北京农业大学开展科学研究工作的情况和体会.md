The Situation of Teachers and the Progress of Scientific Research

Beijing Agricultural University has gathered a considerable force of scientific workers. Currently, the university has a total of 249 teachers, including 5 who have been engaged in teaching and scientific research for more than 30 years, 24 for more than 20 years, and 37 for more than 10 years. Professors and associate professors are mostly scientific workers with certain achievements. They have generally published scientific works and made certain contributions to the country in areas such as plant protection, agricultural chemicals, soil, agricultural chemistry, agronomy, animal husbandry, veterinary medicine, horticulture, and agricultural economics. The strength of these many scientists at Beijing Agricultural University is a valuable asset of the country, and it must be fully utilized to serve the country's cultural and economic construction.

In the past three to four years, teachers at Beijing Agricultural University have been busy studying politics, transforming their thinking, learning advanced Soviet biological science theories, carrying out teaching reforms, studying Soviet teaching syllabuses and textbooks, compiling lecture notes, and learning Russian. Little attention was paid to carrying out scientific research work. After the autumn of 1953, the situation changed. First, Soviet expert Ivanov had finished lecturing on "Michurin Genetics, Selection and Breeding of Fine Varieties," Suijina had finished lecturing on "Principles of Darwinism," and Duberovina had finished lecturing on "Creative Darwinism." Other Soviet experts also gave reports on the theories of Michurin, Lysenko, Williams, Pavlov, etc., thus helping to lay an advanced theoretical foundation for China's biological sciences and agricultural sciences. Second, the teaching reform had achieved preliminary results, and most teachers had initially mastered the new teaching materials. Lecture notes for most courses had been rewritten or revised, and they had been taught once or twice, greatly reducing preparation time. Third, political study was on track, non-teaching activities were reduced, and most teachers were able to directly read professional Soviet materials. Fourth, the Central Higher Education Department supplemented Beijing Agricultural University with teaching equipment in 1953. Fifth, after the announcement of the general task of the country during the transition period, the whole school conducted a relatively in-depth study of relevant documents, and the professors' enthusiasm for scientific research work was greatly enhanced. In this way, scientific research work was initially launched.

Now the plans for various research works have been drawn up and have begun to be implemented. The plan is divided into three aspects: First, to conduct repetitive experiments on the basic theories of Michurin biological science, the main purpose is to enable teachers to directly obtain perceptual knowledge of basic theories, and to make a set of specimens or samples for teaching purposes; Second, to study the scientific and technological problems and management problems in the different stages of the gradual transition from small-scale peasant economy to agricultural collectivization in the process of agricultural transformation, the purpose is to initially explore how science and technology can coordinate and promote the socialist transformation of agriculture; Third, research on theoretical and current major agricultural production issues, the purpose is to combine the improvement of teaching level to solve some of the current major agricultural production issues, and make practical contributions to the country. The research method is basically collective and comprehensive, and closely cooperates with scientific research institutions and relevant business institutions. In our research projects, in addition to the 15 projects researched independently in the school, there are a total of 26 projects researched in cooperation with relevant institutions outside the school, namely 21 projects researched in cooperation with the North China Agricultural Science Research Institute, 3 projects researched in cooperation with the Veterinary Biological Products Supervision Institute of the Central Ministry of Agriculture, and 2 projects researched in cooperation with the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

The 41 projects researched by teachers at Beijing Agricultural University are mostly in line with the current needs of national industrialization and agricultural production increase, as well as the needs of theoretical research and improvement of teaching quality. Among them, there are 14 items on food, cotton and industrial raw material crops; 8 items on breeding, improving livestock and preventing animal diseases; 3 items on solving vegetable production and vegetable supply problems in large cities; 2 items on export fruit products; and 11 comprehensive research projects on agricultural pest and disease control, etc.

The Key to Carrying Out Scientific Research Work

In carrying out scientific research work, we have grasped and initially solved three key issues:

(1) We studied the documents on the general task of the country during the transition period, and improved the teachers' enthusiasm for scientific research work. After the teachers conducted a relatively serious study of the documents on the general task of the country during the transition period, they were inspired by the country's rapid progress and the great socialist cause, and clearly realized three issues: First, they realized that socialist construction has opened up infinitely broad prospects for the development of science, scientific work occupies an extremely important position in national construction, and the experience and knowledge of scientists are the treasure of the country; Second, they realized the important position of agriculture in the country's industrialization, and at the beginning of industrial development, agriculture must also develop accordingly, thus solving the waiting thought of "agriculture will be discussed in the second five-year plan" in the past; Third, they realized that scientific research work must be carried out in a planned and step-by-step manner to continuously improve teaching quality and cultivate construction talents that meet the standards for the country. At the same time, they realized that they are scientific workers and also teaching workers, and bear a major responsibility for the country's industrialization and the socialist transformation of agriculture. The clear understanding of these three issues shows that the teachers' political and ideological level has significantly improved, and thus their work enthusiasm has gained new growth.

(2) Combined with the study of the documents on the general task of the country during the transition period, a relatively profound work inspection and work summary was carried out in the whole school, so that everyone clearly realized the achievements and shortcomings of the past work, and laid the foundation for the development of future work. In the work inspection and summary, the implementation of the Party's policy on intellectuals was focused on, some problems that still existed in the relationship between new and old teachers were resolved, the unity of the whole school was strengthened, and everyone's work enthusiasm was improved. There are two different situations in the relationship between new and old teachers. One is that some young teachers do not respect the rich experience and achievements of the old teachers enough, and demand that the old teachers master the new theories too quickly; the other is that some old teachers who actively learn new theories and thus make rapid progress feel that the old teachers who have reservations about the old theories and learn new theories slowly are "difficult to deal with" and "conservative," while the latter say that the former are "empty" and "dogmatic," and coupled with some prejudices and feelings, the problem tends to be complicated. Before the general task of the country during the transition period was announced, these two different situations existed relatively seriously among some teachers at Beijing Agricultural University, and it must be properly resolved. The solution we have adopted is: in the relationship between young teachers and old teachers, according to the Party's policy on intellectuals, first open up thinking and unify understanding separately, then convene a general meeting of all teachers in the department to openly discuss, launch criticism and self-criticism, draw common conclusions, discuss future improvement opinions, and immediately implement them step by step. For the views of the old teachers on the new and old theories, small meetings were convened for the relevant old professors to carry out criticism and self-criticism, so that the views on the main issues tend to be consistent. In addition, we emphasized the improvement of socialist awareness, transformation of thinking, abandonment of prejudices and unprincipled disputes among all teachers. In this way, on the ideological basis of studying the documents on the general task of the country during the transition period, the problem of the relationship between new and old teachers has been basically resolved. Experience has proved that solving the problem of unity in accordance with the Party's policies is one of the keys to promoting school work.

(3) From the beginning of the work, the leaders focused on opening up the teachers' thinking, so that everyone deeply realized that scientific research work has great significance for national construction and improving teaching. There are not many Chinese scientists, science is backward, and the failure to fully exert the strength of scientists is a huge loss to the country. On the basis of this understanding, we encouraged everyone to tap potential power and carry out scientific research work in accordance with the spirit of streamlining and saving. At the same time as calling for carrying out scientific research work, the principles of scientific research work were determined, mainly: First, scientific research work should be carried out on the basis of Michurin biological science, according to the principle of combining theory with practice, and should be combined with improving teaching quality; Second, old professors should be the backbone, and young teachers should be assistants, to carry out scientific research work, and the school administration should provide conditions; Third, starting from the possible and actual situation, let everyone boldly put forward research plans, mainly opposing the idea of conservatism and stagnation. Experience has proved that at present, carrying out scientific research work requires active advocacy and encouragement, and must have specific leadership, in order to achieve results.

The Consolidation and Development of Scientific Research Work

Scientific research work is not only of great significance to the country's cultural and economic construction, but also necessary and very urgent for improving teaching quality and training new teachers. Because first, it is necessary to improve and deepen teachers' understanding of advanced biological science theories through practice; second, it is necessary to combine advanced Soviet theories with the actual situation of China's agricultural production through practice; third, due to the rapid development of the rural mutual aid and cooperation movement, agricultural production has put forward a series of requirements and problems for agricultural science and technology, and the large number of cadres trained by colleges and universities play an important role in solving these problems. This first requires the current teachers to be able to solve these problems, and many of these problems are completely new to the teachers, and they can only recognize and find solutions through practice. In these practices, teachers' theories and experience will be enriched accordingly, teaching quality will be improved, and new teachers will be trained. Therefore, carrying out scientific research work is the only way to improve teaching quality. Therefore, the scientific research work that teachers have initially begun in a planned manner must be consolidated and improved to lay the foundation for further carrying out scientific research work. For this purpose, for the development of scientific research work, we feel that the following issues should continue to be resolved:

(1) Strengthen the study of Marxist-Leninist theory. The results of the past teachers' study of "On Practice," "On Contradiction" and the current study of "History of the Chinese Revolution" and the documents on the general task of the country during the transition period prove that as long as the teachers' Marxist-Leninist level is continuously improved, their scientific and theoretical level can be continuously improved, their work enthusiasm can be improved, and their ability to criticize bourgeois reactionary scientific thought can be gradually cultivated. Therefore, strengthening teachers' study of Marxist-Leninist theory is the most fundamental link in consolidating and improving their work enthusiasm and carrying out scientific research work. At present, the teachers' Marxist-Leninist theoretical level is very inconsistent with the requirements of the work, and it must be greatly solved. The current three-hour weekly theory study system has become a habit and should be continued. It is necessary to make everyone clearly realize that systematically mastering Marxist-Leninist theory is a long-term and arduous task, and it should not be required that every time you learn a little, you can immediately connect with your work. The three-hour regular study per week is not enough, and teachers should be encouraged to voluntarily squeeze out time as much as possible, strengthen self-study, strengthen mutual assistance in learning, and the leaders must give certain guidance. This is the current possible way to strengthen political study.

(2) Continue to deepen the study of advanced Soviet biological science theories and agricultural production experience, and learn and do at the same time, closely combining theory and practice. It is necessary to continuously deepen the teachers' understanding of this: our country's construction is based on the Soviet Union as an example, and Soviet agriculture is based on the advanced theories of advanced Michurin, Lysenko, Williams and Pavlov; these advanced theories can only grow under the Soviet socialist system and its agricultural production practice, which is impossible for capitalist countries. Therefore, in order to smoothly carry out the socialist transformation of agriculture in our country and make agricultural production get greater development, we must strive to study the advanced Soviet biological science theories and the rich experience of agricultural production. At present, from the perspective of Beijing Agricultural University, the direction of scientific theory has been basically resolved, but the study of advanced Soviet scientific theory has only just begun, and the absorption of Soviet agricultural production experience is even more lagging behind, and the work of combining theory with practice has been done very little. Therefore, we must continue to deepen the study of advanced Soviet theories and experience, and through our own scientific research practice, learn to apply theory to practice, so as to gradually overcome the serious shortcomings of the past that theory is divorced from practice, and create more favorable conditions for the large-scale development of scientific research work in the future.

(3) Implement the Party's policy on intellectuals and further strengthen the unity of teachers. At present, carrying out scientific research work in schools mainly relies on old teachers, because they have richer practical knowledge and experience, but without young teachers as assistants, most of the research work cannot be carried out or is not easy to do well; and old teachers have the responsibility to train new teachers, and new teachers have the task of learning from old teachers, which is required by the interests of the country. Therefore, it is necessary to implement the Party's policy on intellectuals and thoroughly solve the problem of unity between young and old teachers, and solve the problem of unity between old teachers with different progress speeds. From the perspective of Beijing Agricultural University, everyone has basically united on the common scientific direction and the Party's policy ideology, but some problems still exist in certain specific events or emotions. These problems still have an adverse impact on the work, so they should still be attached importance to and seek thorough solutions. The emergence of these problems is due to excessive and impatient demands and the failure to completely eliminate old prejudices. The way to eliminate them is to require teachers to further strengthen mutual trust in their work, put forward opinions directly and frankly, do not retain them, be strict with oneself, be broad with others, concentrate their energy on common progress and doing a good job in common work, continuously improve their socialist ideological consciousness, and use socialist ideas and attitudes to deal with problems, then these problems are not difficult to completely solve.

(4) In order to further carry out scientific research work, it is necessary to continuously create conditions for this work. The issue of creating scientific research conditions is multifaceted. We feel that in addition to improving living conditions as much as possible, the issues that need to be focused on continuing to resolve are: First, the issue of increasing scientific research equipment. To transform an old agricultural school in a semi-feudal and semi-colonial, small-scale peasant economy environment, where teaching is seriously divorced from practice, into a new type of agricultural school that is compatible with the socialist transformation of agriculture and integrates learning and application, the equipment for teaching and scientific research must be greatly transformed and supplemented. Since liberation, the Central Higher Education Department has given Beijing Agricultural University a lot of help in this regard, but it is still not enough. As the work progresses step by step, the equipment conditions must continue to be improved. Second, the research forces bound by school administrative work should be gradually and appropriately released step by step. Third, teachers themselves and the school administration should guarantee teaching and research time from inside and outside the school, so that the school's work and the teachers' work can gradually become planned, so that research work can be carried out according to plan. Fourth, it is necessary to strengthen the connection with various colleges and universities, scientific research institutions, and business institutions, and unite the strength of scientific workers across the country, so as to facilitate the development of scientific research work on a larger scale.

With the rapid development of the country's economic and cultural construction, the importance of scientific research work is becoming more and more significant, and the shortcomings and deficiencies of our scientific work are also becoming increasingly apparent. The shortage of scientific workers is also a major problem. Colleges and universities are an important source of scientific research strength and have great potential. We must fully tap and exert these potential forces and vigorously cultivate the younger generation of the scientific reserve army to develop the motherland's scientific cause.

    北京农业大学开展科学研究工作的情况和体会
    北京农业大学副校长  施平
    教师情况和开展科学研究工作的情况
    北京农业大学集中了不小的一批科学工作力量。现全校共计有教师二百四十九人，从事教学和科学研究工作三十年以上的有五人，二十年以上的二十四人，十年以上的三十七人。教授、副教授大都是有一定成就的科学工作者，一般地都发表过科学著作，在植物保护、农用药剂、土壤、农业化学、农学、畜牧、兽医、园艺、农业经济等方面，对国家都有一定贡献。北京农业大学这许多科学家的力量，是国家的一份宝贵财产，必须充分加以发挥，以服务于国家的文化、经济建设。
    在过去的三四年间，北京农业大学教师们由于忙于学习政治，改造思想，学习苏联先进生物科学理论和进行教学改革，钻研苏联教学大纲、教材，编写讲义，学习俄文等等，在开展科学研究工作方面是很少注意的。一九五三年秋季以后，情况改变了，第一，是因为苏联专家伊万诺夫已讲完“米丘林遗传学选种与良种繁育学”、绥吉纳已讲完“达尔文主义原理”、杜别洛薇娜已讲完“创造性达尔文主义”，其他苏联专家也都做了有关米丘林、李森科、威廉姆士、巴甫洛夫等学说的报告，如此，帮助中国的生物科学和农业科学奠定了先进的理论基础；第二，是因为教学改革已获得初步成绩，大多数教师已初步掌握了新教材，多数课程已重新编写或修订了讲义，并都教过了一遍到两遍，备课的时间大大减少；第三，是因为政治学习走上了轨道，非教学的活动减少，大多数教师已能直接阅读专业苏联材料；第四，是因为中央高等教育部在一九五三年又给北京农业大学充实了教学设备；第五，国家在过渡时期的总任务宣布后，全校对有关文件进行了比较深入的学习，教授们从事科学研究工作的积极性大为提高。这样，科学研究工作便初步地展开了。
    现在各项研究工作的计划都已拟订，并已开始执行。计划分为三个方面：第一方面，进行米丘林生物科学基本理论的重复实验，主要的目的在使教师们直接取得基本理论的感性知识，并制作一套标本或样本供教学之用；第二方面，研究在农业的改造过程中，由小农经济逐步过渡到农业集体化的不同阶段的科学技术问题和经营管理问题，目的是初步摸索科学技术如何配合和推动农业的社会主义改造的规律；第三方面，关于理论的和当前农业生产上的主要问题的研究，目的是结合提高教学水平解决一些当前农业生产上的主要问题，对国家作出实际贡献。研究方法基本上是集体的和综合的，并和科学研究机关及有关业务机关密切合作。在我们的研究项目中，除在校内自己研究的十五个项目外，和校外有关机关合作研究的共二十六项，即和华北农业科学研究所合作研究二十一项，和中央农业部兽医生物药品监察所合作研究三项，和中国科学院合作研究两项。
    北京农业大学的教师们研究的四十一个项目，大都是切合当前国家工业化和农业增产的需要以及理论研究和提高教学质量的需要的。其中关于粮食、棉花和工业原料作物的有十四项；关于繁殖、改良家畜和防治畜病的有八项；关于解决蔬菜生产和大城市蔬菜供应问题的有三项；关于外销果品问题的有两项；关于农业病虫害防治等的综合性研究项目计十一项。
    开展科学研究工作的关键
    我们在开展科学研究工作中，抓住和初步解决了三个关键性的问题：
    （一）学习了关于国家在过渡时期的总任务的文件，提高了教师们科学研究工作的积极性。教师们对关于国家在过渡时期的总任务的文件进行了比较认真的学习以后，为国家的飞跃进步和伟大的社会主义事业所鼓舞，并明确地认识了三个问题：第一，体会到社会主义建设为科学的发展开辟了广阔无比的前途，科学工作在国家建设工作中占着极重要的地位，科学家们的经验和知识是国家的财宝；第二，认识了农业在国家工业化中的重要地位，工业发展开始之时，农业也就要相适应的发展，从而解决了过去认为“农业到第二个五年计划再说”的等待思想；第三，认识到必须有计划有步骤地开展科学研究工作才能不断地提高教学质量，为国家培养合乎规格的建设人才。同时认识到自己是科学工作者同时也是教学工作者，对国家工业化和农业的社会主义改造负有重大的责任。这三个问题的明确认识，说明教师们的政治思想水平显著地提高了，因而工作热情有了新的增长。
      （二）结合对国家在过渡时期总任务的文件的学习，在全校进行了比较深刻的工作检查和工作总结，使大家明确地认识了过去工作的成绩和缺点，为今后工作的开展奠定了基础。在工作的检查和总结中，着重地检查了执行党对知识分子政策的情况，解决了新老教师关系上还存在着的一些问题，加强了全校的团结，提高了大家的工作积极性。新老教师关系有两种不同情况，一种是部分年轻教师对老教师的丰富经验和成就尊重不够，过急地要求老教师掌握新的理论；另一种是部分积极学习新理论因而进步快的老教师觉得对旧理论有保留的、学习新理论较慢的老教师“难搞”、“保守”，而后者则说前者“空洞”、“教条”，加上一些成见和意气，问题就趋于复杂化了。在国家在过渡时期的总任务未宣布前，这两种不同情况在北京农业大学一部分教师中比较严重地存在着，是必须妥善地加以解决的。我们采取的解决办法是：在青年教师和老教师的关系上，根据党对知识分子的政策，先分别打通思想，统一认识，然后召开全系教师大会，公开讨论，展开批评和自我批评，得出共同结论，讨论出今后改进意见，并立即有步骤地予以实施。对老教师之间关于新旧理论的看法，则召集有关老教授开小型会，开展批评和自我批评，使对主要问题的看法趋于一致。此外，我们在全体教师中，强调了提高社会主义的觉悟，改造思想，抛弃成见和无原则纠纷，如此，在学习国家在过渡时期总任务的文件后的思想基础上，新老教师的关系问题就得到基本的解决。经过这些加强团结的工作，在教师们相互的关系上出现了许多新的气象。经验证明：按照党的政策解决团结问题，是推动学校工作的关键之一。
    （三）领导方面从工作之始，就着重打通教师思想，使大家深刻认识科学研究工作对国家建设和提高教学都有重大意义。中国科学家不多，科学落后，科学家力量的不能充分发挥，是国家的巨大损失。在此认识的基础上，鼓舞大家根据精简节约的精神，发掘潜在力量，开展科学研究工作。和号召开展科学研究工作同时，确定了科学研究工作的原则，主要是：第一，科学研究工作应在米丘林生物科学的基础上，根据理论结合实际的原则进行，并应和提高教学质量相结合；第二，以老教授为骨干，年轻教师为助手，开展科学研究工作，学校行政方面则提供条件；第三，从可能和实际情况出发，让大家大胆地提出研究计划，主要反对保守不前的思想。经验证明：目前开展科学研究工作，需要积极的提倡和多多鼓励，并须有具体领导，才能收到效果。
    科学研究工作的巩固和发展问题
    科学研究工作不但对国家的文化、经济建设有重大意义，就是对提高教学质量和培养新师资也有其必要性，而且是十分迫切的事。因为第一，须要通过实践去提高和加深教师们对先进生物科学理论的认识；第二，须要通过实践把苏联先进的理论和中国的农业生产实际结合起来；第三，由于农村互助合作运动的迅速发展，农业生产对农业科学技术提出了一系列的要求和问题，对解决这些问题，高等学校培养的大批干部，有着重要的作用。这就首先要求现在的教师们能解决这些问题，而这些问题的许多项目对教师们却是全新的，只有通过实践才能去认识和找出解决办法。在这些实践中，教师们的理论和经验将随之丰富，教学质量也就能提高，新的师资也能得到培养。所以开展科学研究工作是提高教学质量的必由之路。因此，对教师们初步有计划地开始的科学研究工作，必须使之巩固和提高，为进一步开展科学研究工作打下基础。为了这个目的，为了科学研究工作的发展，我们觉得应继续解决以下几个问题：
      （一）加强马克思列宁主义理论的学习。过去教师们学习“实践论”、“矛盾论”和目前学习“中国革命史”和关于国家在过渡时期的总任务的文件的结果，证明只要不断地提高教师们的马克思列宁主义水平，就能不断地提高他们的科学理论水平，就能提高他们的工作的积极性，并逐渐培养起他们批判资产阶级反动科学思想的能力，所以加强教师们马克思列宁主义理论的学习，是巩固、提高其工作积极性和展开科学研究工作的最根本环节。目前教师们的马克思列宁主义理论水平和工作的要求是很不相适应的，必须大力求得解决。现在每周三小时的理论学习制度已成为习惯，要继续坚持。要使大家明确认识到：系统地掌握马克思列宁主义理论是长期的艰苦的事，不应要求每学一点就能立即和业务相联系。每周三小时的正规学习并不是就够了的，要鼓励教师们自愿地、尽可能地挤出时间，加强自学，加强学习的互助，领导方面则须给以一定的指导，这是目前可能做到的加强政治学习的办法。
    （二）继续加深对苏联先进生物科学理论和农业生产经验的学习，并边学边做，把理论和实际密切结合起来。要不断加深教师的这样一个认识：我们国家的建设，是以苏联为榜样的，苏联的农业，是以先进的米丘林、李森科、威廉姆士和巴甫洛夫的先进理论为基础的；这些先进理论，只有在苏联的社会主义制度下和它的农业生产实际中才能成长起来，是资本主义国家不可能有的，所以为了顺利地进行我国农业的社会主义改造，使农业生产得到更大的发展，必须努力学习苏联的先进生物科学理论和农业生产的丰富经验。目前从北京农业大学来说，科学理论的方向问题已基本解决了，但对苏联先进科学理论的学习才开始不久，对苏联农业生产经验的吸收更落后一步，理论和实际相结合的工作还做得很少，所以我们必须继续加深对苏联先进理论和经验的学习，并通过自己科学研究工作的实践，学会把理论应用于实际，从而逐步克服过去理论脱离实际的严重缺点，为今后科学研究工作的大规模的开展创造更有利的条件。
    （三）贯彻执行党对知识分子的政策，进一步加强教师的团结。目前在学校中进行科学研究工作，主要是依靠老教师，因为他们有较丰富的实际知识和经验，但没有年轻教师为助手，则大多数的研究工作就无法进行或不易做好；而且老教师有培养新教师的责任，新教师有向老教师学习的任务，这是国家的利益所要求的，因此，必须贯彻执行党对知识分子的政策，彻底解决年轻的和年老的教师之间的团结问题，解决进步快慢不同的老教师之间的团结问题。从北京农业大学的情形来看，大家已在共同的科学方向和党的政策思想上基本地团结起来了，但在某些具体事件上或感情上，还存在着一些问题，这些问题仍使工作受到不利影响，所以仍应加以重视，求得彻底解决。这些问题的产生是由于要求过高过急和旧的成见还未彻底清除。清除的办法，是要求教师们从工作中进一步加强互相间的信任，有意见直截了当地提出，不要保留，对己要严，对人要求应宽，把精力集中在共同进步和搞好共同工作上，不断提高社会主义的思想觉悟，以社会主义的思想和态度来处理问题，则这些问题是不难彻底解决的。
      （四）为了进一步开展科学研究工作，必须不断地为这一工作创造条件。创设科学研究条件的问题，是多方面的。我们觉得除生活条件还要尽可能逐步地加以改善外，要继续着重解决的问题是：首先，增加科学研究设备的问题，把一个半封建半殖民地的、小农经济环境的、教学和实际严重脱离的旧农业学校，改造成为一个和农业的社会主义改造相适应的、学用一致的新型农业学校，在教学和科学研究的设备上，是必须大事改造和补充的。解放以来，中央高等教育部在这方面已经给予北京农业大学以不少的帮助，但还很不够，随着工作一步步的开展，设备条件仍须不断改进。第二，要把束缚在学校行政工作上的研究力量，有步骤地、适当地逐步解脱出来。第三，要教师们自己和学校行政上从校内、校外保证教学研究的时间，使学校工作和教师们的工作逐步走上计划化，才能使研究工作按计划进行。第四，要加强和各高等学校、科学研究机关以及业务机关的联系，把全国科学工作者的力量联合起来，以利于更大规模地开展科学研究工作。
    随着国家经济和文化建设的迅速发展，科学研究工作的重要性越来越显著了，而我们科学工作的缺点和不足也日益显露，科学工作人员的不足也是一大问题。高等学校是科学研究工作力量的一个重要泉源，有很大的潜在力量，我们必须把这些潜在力量充分地挖掘出来，加以发挥，大力培养科学后备大军的年轻的一代，以发展祖国的科学事业。
