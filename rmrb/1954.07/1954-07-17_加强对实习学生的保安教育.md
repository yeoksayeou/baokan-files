    Strengthen Security Education for Intern Students
    Recently, a few students from several higher industrial schools and industrial secondary technical schools have continuously violated security regulations at production internship sites. For example, a student from the East China Institute of Chemical Technology, interning at the Northeast Petroleum Plant No. 1, climbed a high ladder without permission, intending to observe a high-voltage electrostatic precipitator (66,000 volts). Fortunately, a worker discovered him when he was only three feet away from the precipitator and urgently called out to stop him. If it had been any later, the student would have been drawn into the electrostatic precipitator and burned to a crisp. This is a matter that warrants high vigilance.
    The main reason for this situation is that some schools and factories, thinking "no accidents happened last year," have become complacent; among some of the students who participated in internships last year, there is a sense of self-satisfaction, thinking "I interned once last year, there's nothing to it." This is extremely dangerous. If this situation is not changed, it could lead to serious safety accidents and production accidents. Last year, a student from the Northeast Institute of Technology, interning at the Fuxin Coal Mine, had his right foot severed by a coal cutter; in 1952, a student from a certain university, interning at the Yumen Oilfield, disobeyed the instructions of on-site personnel and broke an ironworker's leg, and he himself was seriously injured. These incidents should be taken as lessons.
    This year, most students are engaged in professional production internships. Intern students, as workers, foreman's assistants, or other technician's assistants, go deep into workshops or construction sections and directly participate in operations. However, the labor protection organizations in our country's factories and mines are not yet sound, and the safety equipment in some enterprises is not perfect enough. Therefore, the possibility of safety accidents for intern students has increased. We must heighten our vigilance and strengthen security education for intern students to ensure the normal progress of production internships.
    Security education for intern students should be the joint responsibility of schools and enterprises. The idea of some teachers leading internships that they "only focus on teaching and neglect safety" is wrong, and the idea of some factory and mine cadres that security education for students "is only the responsibility of the teachers leading the internship" is also wrong. Teachers leading internships should be responsible for the security education of intern students. Throughout the entire production internship process, teachers should educate students to strictly abide by operating procedures and internship discipline. However, during the internship, intern students are scattered in various workshops or construction sites, the number of teachers is small, and they are not familiar with the situation in the factories and mines. Therefore, it is not possible to do this work well by relying solely on teachers. On the other hand, factories and mines have specialized security organizations and full-time security cadres, and the internship leaders of factories and mines are familiar with the production characteristics of their units. Therefore, enterprises should also be responsible for doing a good job in security education for intern students. Only under the joint responsibility of the relevant personnel of the factories and mines and the teachers leading the internship can the security education of the intern students be done well.
    Security education must be carried out regularly. According to last year's experience, because schools and factories conducted security education before and at the beginning of the students' entry into the factory, they were generally cautious and able to abide by internship discipline in the beginning. However, after a period of internship, they became more familiar with the production situation and equipment conditions of the factories and mines, and they developed a sense of self-satisfaction, thinking "machine operation is very simple" and "it's not so difficult after all." They might easily take action, and many accidents were caused at this time. Therefore, the teachers leading the internship and the relevant personnel of the factories and mines should conduct security education at any time and should also conduct regular inspections of security conditions. Through specific incidents of intern students violating security discipline, they should educate intern students in a timely manner to eliminate all safety accidents and production accidents and ensure the smooth progress of production internships.

### 加强对实习学生的保安教育

    加强对实习学生的保安教育
    最近若干高等工业学校和工业性质的中等专业学校的少数学生，在生产实习现场连续发生了几件违犯保安纪律的事件。例如，华东化工学院在东北石油一厂实习的一个学生，擅自攀登高梯，准备观察高压电除雾器（六万六千伏特），幸而在他爬到距离电除雾器三尺远的地方，为工人发觉，急呼阻止。如果再迟一步，这个学生就会被电除雾器吸过去，烧成焦炭。这是值得高度警惕的。
    造成这种情况的主要原因是，有些学校和厂矿，以为“去年没有发生事故”，思想麻痹；在去年参加过实习的部分学生中间，则存在着“去年实习过一次了，没什么”的自满情绪。这是极端危险的。这种情况如不改变，就可能导致严重的安全事故和生产事故。去年东北工学院在阜新煤矿实习的一个学生被截煤机截断了右脚；一九五二年，在玉门油矿实习的某大学一个实习学生，不服从现场人员指导，把一个铁工的腿折断，他自己也受了重伤。这些事件，应当引为教训。
    今年大部分学生是进行专业生产实习的，实习学生是以工人、工长助手或其他技术员助手的身份，深入车间或施工地段，直接参加操作，而目前我国厂矿企业的劳动保护组织机构尚不健全，某些企业的安全设备也还不够完善，因此，实习学生发生安全事故的可能性增加了。我们必须提高警惕，加强对实习学生的保安教育，才能保证生产实习的正常进行。
    对于实习学生的保安教育，应当由学校和企业共同负责。某些领导实习的教师“只重教学，忽视安全”的思想是不对的，某些厂矿干部认为，学生的保安教育“只是领导实习教师的事”的思想也是不对的。领导实习的教师，对于实习学生的保安教育，应当负责，在整个生产实习过程中，教师都应当教育学生严格遵守操作规程和实习纪律。但是在实习中，实习学生分散在各个车间或工地，教师人数少，又不熟悉厂矿情况，因此光靠教师是做不好这个工作的；而厂矿有专门的保安机构和专职的保安干部，厂矿的实习领导人员又熟悉本单位的生产特点，所以企业方面也应该负责做好对实习学生的保安教育。只有在厂矿有关人员和领导实习的教师共同负责下，实习学生的保安教育，才能够做好。
    保安教育必须经常进行。根据去年的经验，由于学生在下厂以前和下厂之初，学校方面和厂矿方面都进行了保安教育，所以在最初的时候，他们一般都是谨慎的，能够遵守实习纪律；但是，经过一段实习生活，他们对厂矿的生产情况和设备条件比较熟悉了，便会产生“机器操作很简单”“原来也不过如此”等自满情绪，可能轻易动手，许多事故正是在这个时候造成的。因此，领导实习的教师和厂矿的有关人员应当随时进行保安教育，并且要经常进行关于保安情况的检查，通过实习学生违犯保安纪律的具体事件，及时向实习学生进行教育，消灭一切安全事故和生产事故，保证生产实习的顺利进行。
