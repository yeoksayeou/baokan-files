Xinhua News Agency, July 15th, London: Prime Minister Churchill reported to the House of Commons on the Anglo-American Washington talks on the 12th.

Churchill said, regarding the Indochina issue, "Regarding the guarantees for any agreement that may be reached in Geneva, we have explained our views to the Americans, and they now better understand these views. We hope that if an acceptable solution to the Indochina problem is reached, a way can be found to have all the countries participating in the conference guarantee it."

Referring to the recent calls from various quarters for the swift restoration of the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations, Prime Minister Churchill said, "The British government believes that the Central People's Government should represent China in the United Nations, but it does not believe that now is the time to reconsider this issue." Reuters reported that Churchill's remarks were at least temporarily aligning British policy with the American policy outlined by Eisenhower. However, the Reuters report pointed out that "in the current American political atmosphere, there is no hope of overcoming the fundamental differences between Britain and the United States."

Xinhua News Agency, July 16th, London: TASS reported from London on the 15th that during the foreign affairs debate in the British House of Commons, Labour MP Barbara Castle expressed dissatisfaction with Churchill, arguing that Churchill "deviated from British policy on the issue of China's entry into the United Nations."

Mrs. Castle also criticized the government's policy towards France. She said: "It is intolerable that Churchill has joined the campaign of blackmailing France in recent weeks. Applying pressure to France, adopting such an attitude towards an old ally so closely linked to us, is completely unacceptable." Mrs. Castle went on to say that everyone now understands, as the French have long understood, that the German question cannot be resolved without the agreement of Russia. The current situation urgently requires a resumption of the Four Power conference to discuss the German question.

Labour MP John Strachey called for the restoration of the People's Republic of China's legitimate rights in the United Nations. He said, "This is necessary for all mankind. It will cause some anger among Americans, but as long as everyone remains calm and resolute in talking about this issue, they will gradually get used to it."

The last opposition speaker was P. Noel-Baker.

In concluding the debate, Deputy Foreign Secretary Selwyn Lloyd spoke on behalf of the government, reiterating Churchill's position on the issue of restoring China's rights in the United Nations.

Lloyd believed that the "European Defense Community" seemed to be "the most satisfactory way to ensure that Germany contributes to defense."

Xinhua News Agency, July 16th, London: TASS reported from London on the 15th that Prime Minister Churchill, in response to Clement Attlee's remarks, reiterated the views he stated in the House of Commons on July 12 regarding the issue of allowing the People's Republic of China to enter the United Nations.

In response to Attlee's suggestion that he meet with G. M. Malenkov, Churchill said that he had previously expressed his views on this issue and had nothing to add.

Churchill advocated rearming West Germany, regardless of whether France ratified the "European Defense Community" treaty.

Near the end of his speech, Churchill said: The British government and the American government have concluded that if the "European Defense Community" treaty is not ratified, then the best way for them to achieve their goals is to separate the Bonn Treaty and the "European Defense Community" treaty. If possible, this should be done with the consent of the signatory countries of the two treaties.

### 英国下院举行外交问题辩论的情况

    英国下院举行外交问题辩论的情况
    【新华社十五日讯】伦敦消息：邱吉尔首相十二日向下院报告英美华盛顿会谈的情况。
    邱吉尔谈到印度支那问题时说：“关于日内瓦可能达成的任何协议的保证，我们已把我们的看法向美国人说明，现在他们已更了解这些看法了。我们希望，假如达成了解决印度支那问题的可以接受的办法，就可以找出方法使参与会议的各国保证它。”
    谈到各方面近来纷纷主张迅速恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法地位的问题时，邱吉尔首相说：“英国政府认为应当由中央人民政府在联合国中代表中国，但是它并不认为现在是重新考虑这个问题的时刻。”路透社在报道中说，邱吉尔这番话是使英国政策至少暂时地迎合了艾森豪威尔所表明的美国的政策。但是路透社消息指出，“在目前美国的政治气氛中，要想克服英美之间的基本分歧是没有希望的。”
   【新华社十六日讯】塔斯社伦敦十五日讯：据英国新闻联合社消息，在英国下院举行外交问题辩论时，工党议员巴巴拉·卡斯尔夫人对邱吉尔表示不满，她认为，邱吉尔“在让中国进入联合国问题上脱离了英国的政策”。
    卡斯尔夫人也指责了政府对法国的政策。她说：“邱吉尔加入了最近几周来对法国进行讹诈的运动，这实在是不能容忍的。对法国施用压力，对这样一个和我们唇齿相依的老盟友采取这种态度是完全不能容忍的。”卡斯尔夫人接着说，无疑，现在大家都了解，正如法国人早就已了解的一样，如果不取得俄国的一致意见，德国问题是不能得到解决的。当前局势迫切要求必须重新举行讨论德国问题的四大国会议。
    工党议员约翰·斯特拉彻要求恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法权利。他说：“对全人类来说，这是必需的。这会引起美国人一些愤怒，但是，只要大家始终心平气和地和坚定不移地谈到这个问题，他们是会逐渐习惯的。”
    最后一个代表反对党发言的是菲·诺埃尔—贝克。
    在结束辩论时，外交副大臣塞尔温·劳埃德代表政府发言，他重复了邱吉尔对恢复中国在联合国权利的问题所采取的立场。
    劳埃德认为“欧洲防务集团”似乎是“保证使德国对防务有所贡献的最令人满意的方法”。
    【新华社十六日讯】塔斯社伦敦十五日讯：英国首相邱吉尔在回答克莱门特·艾德礼的发言时，在关于让中华人民共和国进入联合国的问题上，重申了七月十二日他在下院的发言中所申述过的观点。
    邱吉尔在回答艾德礼关于要他和格·马·马林科夫会晤的意见时说，他以前已就这一问题表示过意见，没有什么要补充的了。
    邱吉尔主张重新武装西德，而不问法国是否批准“欧洲防务集团”条约。
    邱吉尔在发言快结束时说：英国政府和美国政府已作出了结论：如果“欧洲防务集团”条约得不到批准，那时他们要达到自己的目的的最好办法就是把波恩条约和“欧洲防务集团”条约分开。如果可能的话，在这样做时，应取得这两个条约的签字国的同意。
