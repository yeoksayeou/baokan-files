The State Encourages, Guides, and Assists the Development of Cooperative Economy

　　Every Action Has a Direction
　　Lu Gentang, the head of the Xinhua Agricultural Production Cooperative in Fengcheng, Jiangxi Province, felt that with the Constitution, the people of the whole country have a direction for every action; with it, we can guarantee our country's victorious transition to socialist society. He said: Article 4 of the draft Constitution stipulates that our country should be built into a socialist society. As the head of an agricultural cooperative, I must use the spirit of the draft Constitution to educate all members and study and discuss with them to improve their enthusiasm and creativity in production. After our cooperative expanded this year, we have 156 mu more land than last year. In order to implement the state's requirement of "all-round increase in production," we have corrected the past phenomenon of applying fertilizer only to high-yield fields. When people saw our seedlings, they all said, "This year, the cooperative's fields are all equally good." Last year, the average yield per mu of our cooperative's double-cropping fields was 744 jin, and the average yield per mu of single-cropping fields was 491 jin; this year, the planned yield for double-cropping fields is 850 jin, and the planned yield for single-cropping fields is 540 jin. We are confident in completing the state's task of increasing production. In order to support socialist industrial construction, our cooperative guarantees to increase grain production by 21,838 jin this year on the basis of last year's high yield. We must also better lead the mutual aid teams and individual farmers to do a good job in mutual assistance and cooperation to develop production.

　　Continuous Assistance from the State
　　Zhao Bin, the director of the Wusan Agricultural Production Cooperative in Rehe Province, believes that the provisions in the draft Constitution on encouraging, guiding, and assisting the development of the cooperative economy point out the path for farmers to get rid of poverty forever and lead a happy life. He used his own cooperative as an example: Over the past few years, our cooperative has continuously received assistance from the state. In 1952 and 1953, we successively used double-wheeled double-shared plows and horse-drawn seeders, and the crops cultivated using these farm tools achieved harvests that had never been seen before. Last year, the average yield per mu of sorghum reached 716 jin; soybeans reached 426 jin. Before we were organized, the maximum yield per mu of sorghum was only about 400 jin, and soybeans could only yield about 200 jin. Due to the increase in production, the income of each member has increased. Last autumn, after paying public grain and all expenses, each member's family received an average of more than 1,100 jin of grain. In the autumn of 1953 and the spring of this year, with the help of state-owned farms, we used tractors to deep-plow, harrow, and roll more than 1,000 mu of land. The land plowed by tractors in one day is equivalent to the work done by 94 horses and 25 people. This has brought even greater happiness to our farmers and reduced our heavy physical labor. Under the leadership of the Party and with the help of the working class, the farmers in our village have deeply realized the benefits of getting organized. This spring, our village formed an advanced agricultural production cooperative of a completely socialist nature from five semi-socialist agricultural production cooperatives. The establishment of this advanced cooperative will enable the land yield of our entire cooperative (accounting for 82% of the farmers in the entire village) to increase by 88.9% compared to last year, making our lives even better and improved.
　　All of our members must continue to work hard in accordance with the path pointed out in the draft Constitution and work with the people of the whole country to gradually build our country into a socialist society.

　　No Longer a "Poor Stick" Village
　　The Han'en Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jilin Province was established in February 1952, and it has only been two years and four months since then. In the first year of the establishment of the cooperative, because the land was connected and managed uniformly, agricultural technology was improved, and agriculture and sideline industries were combined, the hail disaster was overcome. The corn in the high-yield area yielded 10,000 jin per hectare, and the millet in the high-yield area also yielded 5,000 jin per hectare, creating a new record for the entire village. By autumn, each labor day was distributed with 51 jin of grain. The income of cooperative members increased by an average of 50% to 100% compared to members of mutual aid teams and individual farmers in the village. There is a saying circulating in Bao'an Village: "The cooperative has strength, and the income of women in the cooperative surpasses the men outside the cooperative." This year, the cooperative has seen new developments. The cooperative has 108 members, accounting for more than 78% of the total number of farmers in the village, cultivating more than 157 hectares of land. Because there are more people and greater strength, the cooperative has newly opened 23 hectares of paddy fields this year. New member Ji Wanchun said: "In the past, when we were in the mutual aid team, we knew that some waterlogged land could be converted into paddy fields to yield twice as much grain, but the mutual aid team had few people and weak strength, and we couldn't do it for three or four years. After joining the cooperative, it was achieved in only two months." Han'en said: The cooperative road is the road to common prosperity, which has been truly and clearly proven. The provision in the draft Constitution that the state should encourage, guide, and assist its development is completely correct. He said that due to the development of production and the increase in the income of cooperative members, their lives have also improved. More than 80% of the farmers in the cooperative are living a life above the level of middle peasants. We have turned the poor village into a new countryside with abundant food and clothing. According to the actual situation, this autumn, our cooperative will be upgraded to a fully socialist cooperative. We will plant fruit trees on barren mountains, turn barren swamps into fertile fields, build fish ponds, and install the electric lights that we have been hoping for for many years. In a few years, our cooperative will undergo fundamental changes. At that time, we will use tractors to cultivate the land, harvesters to harvest crops, and cars to transport grain home.

　　Satisfactory Provisions
　　Kang Juying, an agricultural labor model and the head of the Kang Juying Agricultural Production Cooperative in Hunan Province, said: Article 7 of the draft Constitution stipulates that the state protects the property of cooperatives and encourages, guides, and assists the development of the cooperative economy. This provision makes us feel very satisfied.
　　The Kang Juying Agricultural Cooperative had a bumper harvest last year. The cooperative's more than 116 mu of land yielded more than 7,500 jin of grain more than when they were in the mutual aid team the year before, and the yield per mu reached 528 jin, an increase of 13% compared to the previous year. There is a Li Changgui mutual aid team near the cooperative, which is famous throughout the township. The mutual aid team has a complete team and good land, but last year the average yield per mu was only 507.5 jin. Individual farmer Li Tansheng is a good farmer, and his family's foundation is also good, but he only harvested 435 jin of grain per mu. With the development of production, the lives of the members of the Kang Juying Cooperative have also improved. The agricultural cooperative initially had 12 households (now it has 28 households). Although there are 4 middle peasant households among them, everyone's life was not good, but now they all live a life at the level of middle peasants. Last year, they also sold more than 19,000 jin of grain to the state. Kang Juying said: Isn't the benefit of the cooperative road to farmers obvious? In addition, the state's encouragement and assistance: In the winter before last, when the mutual aid team was preparing to transform into an agricultural cooperative, the Party and the government sent cadres to lead them to study the policy of mutual aid and cooperation, explained the principles to them, and calculated the accounts for them before the agricultural cooperative was established. After the cooperative was established, there were many new situations and new problems in production, and the cadres helped them to come up with ideas. The government also often took measures such as opening short-term training classes or holding meetings and organizing visits to train cadres. At the beginning of the cooperative, they still had many difficulties in production and life, and the government gave priority to helping them solve them. Recently, their topdressing plan was unable to be completed due to lack of money, and the government loaned them 1.3 million yuan, which solved the problem. In addition, the supply and marketing cooperative also signed a combination contract with them, which gave them great convenience in buying and selling. Kang Juying said: Our agricultural cooperative was established in its current state under the encouragement and assistance of the Party and the government.

### 国家鼓励、指导和帮助合作社经济的发展

    国家鼓励、指导和帮助合作社经济的发展
    一举一动都有了方向
    江西省丰城爱国乡新湖农业生产合作社社长卢根堂感到，有了宪法全国人民一举一动就都有了方向；有了它，就可以保证我国胜利的过渡到社会主义社会。他说：宪法草案第四条规定了要把我国建成社会主义社会。我是一个农业社社长，必须用宪法草案的精神教育全体社员，和社员一起学习讨论，提高他们生产上的积极性和创造性。我们社今年扩大后，田比去年多了一百五十六亩，为了贯彻国家“全面增产”的要求，纠正了过去有肥都往丰产田里放的现象。群众看到我们的禾苗，都说：“今年农业社的田，丘丘都一样好。”去年，我社的双季田（连作）每亩平均产量是七百四十四斤，一季田每亩平均产量是四百九十一斤；今年双季田的计划产量是八百五十斤，一季田计划产量是五百四十斤。我们有把握完成国家交给的增产任务，为了支援社会主义工业建设，我社今年保证在去年的丰产基础上，增产二万一千八百三十八斤粮食。我们还要更好的带动互助组和单干农民，搞好互助合作来发展生产。
    连续不断地得到国家帮助
    热河省五三农业生产合作社主任赵斌认为，宪法草案中关于鼓励、指导和帮助合作社经济发展的规定给农民指出了永远摆脱贫困、通往幸福生活的道路。他拿自己的社作例子说：几年来，我们社已经连续不断地得到了国家的帮助。一九五二年和一九五三年我们先后使上了双轮双铧犁和马拉播种机，使用这些农具耕种的庄稼得到了过去没有过的丰收。去年每亩高粱平均产量达七百一十六斤；大豆达四百二十六斤。而在没有组织起来以前，每亩高粱最多才能打四百来斤，大豆只能打二百来斤。由于提高了产量，每个社员都增加了收入，去年秋天，全社打的粮食除了缴公粮和一切开支外，每个社员家里每人平均都分到了一千一百多斤粮。在一九五三年秋和今年春天，我们社在国营农场的帮助下，一共有一千多亩地用拖拉机进行了深翻和耙、耢，拖拉机一天翻的地就顶我们用九十四匹马和二十五个人做的活，这更给我们农民带来了更大的幸福，使我们减轻了繁重的体力劳动。我村农民在党的领导和工人老大哥的帮助下，深深体会到组织起来的好处。我们村在今年春天已由五个半社会主义性质的农业生产合作社组成了一个完全社会主义性质的高级农业生产合作社。这个高级社的建立，使我们全社（占全村百分之八十二的农户）的土地产量，可以比去年提高百分之八十八点九，使我们的生活更加改善提高。
    我们全体社员要按照宪法草案中所指出的道路，继续努力，和全国人民一起，逐步地把我国建成社会主义社会。
    不再是“穷棒子”村了
    吉林省韩恩农业生产合作社是在一九五二年二月建成的，到现在才有两年零四个多月。建社的头一年因为土地连片，统一经营，改进农业技术，农副业结合，战胜了雹灾，丰产地的苞米一垧地打了
  一万斤，丰产地谷子每垧地还打了五千斤，创造了全村的新纪录，到秋每个劳动日分了五十一斤粮食。社员比村内互助组组员和单干农民的收入平均增加了五成到一倍以上。保安村中流传着这样一句话：“合作社有力量，社内妇女的收入，赛过了社外的男子汉。”今年合作社又有了新的发展，全社有一百零八户社员，占全村总农户的百分之七十八以上，耕种着一百五十七垧多地。因为人多力量大，全社今年又新开了二十三垧水田。新社员纪万春说：“过去咱在互助组时，知道有些涝地要改成水田就能多打一倍的粮食，可是互助组人少力量弱，三四年也没办到，入了社只两个月就实现了。”韩恩说：合作社道路是大家共同富裕的道路，已经千真万确地被证实了。宪法草案中规定国家要鼓励、指导和帮助它的发展，这是完全正确的。他说，我们社由于生产的发展和社员们收入的增加，生活也得到了改善，全社百分之八十以上的农户都过着中农以上的生活，我们把穷棒子村变成了丰衣足食的新农村。根据实际情况，今年秋天我们社就要提高为完全社会主义性质的合作社，要在荒山上栽上果树，把荒甸子开成良田，还要建立养鱼池，并安上我们希望了多年的电灯。几年后我们社将要发生根本的变化，那时将使用拖拉机耕种土地，用收割机收割庄稼，用汽车往家运粮食。
    称心的规定
    农业劳动模范、湖南省康菊英农业生产合作社社长康菊英说：宪法草案第七条中规定国家保护合作社的财产，鼓励、指导和帮助合作社经济的发展。这个规定使我们感到十分称心。
    康菊英农业社去年大丰收，全社一百一十六亩多田，比前年在互助组的时候多打了七千五百多斤粮食，每亩田的产量达到了五百二十八斤，比前年增产了一成三。该社附近有一个全乡闻名的李长桂互助组，这个互助组班子齐、田土好，但去年每亩田平均产量还只有五百零七斤半。单干农民李潭生是个种田的好手，屋里的底子也还不错，每亩只打了四百三十五斤粮食。生产发展了，康菊英社社员们的生活也都好了，农业社最初共有十二户
  （现在是二十八户），这里面虽有四户是中农，但大家的日子过得并不好，现在全都过上中农水平的生活了，去年还卖了一万九千多斤粮食给国家。康菊英说：合作化这条道路给农民的好处不是明摆着的吗？再说国家的鼓励和帮助：前年冬天，由互助组准备转为农业社时，党和政府派来了干部领导他们学习互助合作的政策，把道理讲给他们听，把账算给他们看，农业社才办起来了。社办起来以后，生产上有好多新情况和新问题，干部又帮他们出主意。政府还常常采取开办短期训练班或是开会、组织参观等办法，培养干部。初办社时，他们在生产和生活上还有不少的困难，政府就优先地帮助他们解决。最近，他们的追肥计划又因为没有钱，眼看到无法完成时，政府就贷了一百三十万元给他们，这个问题又解决了。另外，供销合作社还与他们订了结合合同，买进卖出都给了他们很大的方便。康菊英说：我们的农业社就是在党和政府的鼓励和帮助之下办成现在这个样子的。
