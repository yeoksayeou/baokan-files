The Northeast region has actively implemented the resolutions of the Second National Civil Affairs Conference and has made new achievements in preferential treatment work. Most families of revolutionary martyrs, families of revolutionary servicemen, and demobilized and transferred soldiers are actively participating in production and construction with the help of the government, and some have become backbones of mutual aid and cooperation organizations and labor models in industrial and agricultural production. According to statistics from 323 villages in 15 counties of Heilongjiang Province, 7,045 households of martyrs' families, servicemen's families, and demobilized soldiers have joined mutual aid and cooperation organizations, accounting for 78% of the total number of martyrs' families, servicemen's families, and demobilized soldiers in these villages. Among the cadres in nine villages in the suburbs of Changchun City, martyrs' families, servicemen's families, and demobilized soldiers account for 22%. Jin Taihan, a demobilized soldier from Qinggouzi Village in the Seventh District of Ji'an County, was elected as the paddy field production team leader and village finance and grain director of the Honorary Agricultural Production Cooperative, and was honorably awarded the title of Model Demobilized Soldier.

While organizing the families of martyrs, families of servicemen, and demobilized soldiers to participate in production, rural areas in various regions have also carried out key adjustments to the work of substitute farming, so that each laborer does not bear more than five substitute farming workdays, overcoming the phenomenon of excessively light or heavy substitute farming burdens in the past. The forms of substitute farming in various regions have also been further integrated with mutual aid and cooperation organizations. In Liaodong and Songjiang provinces, land farmed on behalf of others by mutual aid groups and agricultural production cooperatives accounts for 80% to 90% of the total area of land farmed on behalf of others. Some counties have fully implemented substitute farming by mutual aid and cooperation organizations.

Various regions have also paid special attention to helping the families of martyrs, families of servicemen, and demobilized soldiers establish their homes, so that they can engage in production with peace of mind. According to statistics from 54 villages in eight counties of four provinces, including Liaoxi, 97% of demobilized soldiers have land and 93.3% have houses. Weichang County and Aohan Banner in Rehe Province used production subsidies to purchase 170 head of draught cattle for the families of martyrs and servicemen. In some areas, the masses also voluntarily taught servicemen's families agricultural production techniques and helped them formulate production plans.

In cities, the people's governments of various provinces and cities attach great importance to organizing the families of martyrs, families of servicemen, and demobilized soldiers to participate in production and employment. Various regions have rectified the production units of servicemen's families that have already been organized, and have also focused on organizing elderly and weak women and disabled soldiers to participate in decentralized handicraft production groups. Shenhe District in Shenyang City has organized two handicraft production groups for martyrs' families and servicemen's families, with 116 participants. Each of them has a fixed monthly salary income, and their lives are guaranteed. At present, 60 households of martyrs' families and servicemen's families have voluntarily requested the government to stop subsidies.

Impoverished families of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary servicemen in Beijing have been given priority for production or employment opportunities. According to the principle of focusing on introducing employment and organizing production, from January to June of this year, the city introduced 904 martyrs' families, servicemen's families, and disabled revolutionary soldiers to work in various government agencies, enterprises, factories, and other departments (including 278 temporary workers), totaling more than 2,500 people including those introduced in 1953. In order to cultivate the employment conditions of martyrs' families and servicemen's families, Beijing has been holding cultural learning classes for martyrs' families and servicemen's families since April of this year, with more than 120 people participating in the first phase of study. Those with poor employment conditions are organized to carry out various small-scale handicraft production. In the first half of this year, in addition to rectifying the original 25 production groups for martyrs' families and servicemen's families, various districts in the city organized 103 new production groups, with a total of more than 1,200 martyrs' families and servicemen's families participating in these 128 production groups. They are engaged in 29 kinds of production such as laundry, sewing, box making, and binding. These productions are relatively easy, and many elderly martyrs' families and servicemen's families can also participate. In order to take care of women engaged in housework, the production group adopts the method of centralized leadership and decentralized production.

After the martyrs' families and servicemen's families participate in production, their lives have been improved. Among the ten households of martyrs' families and servicemen's families participating in production in Taiping Street, Xidan District, six households are now able to support themselves, and the lives of four households have been improved. After Bian Yinfang, a serviceman's family member, joined the sewing group, the lives of her family of five have been basically guaranteed.

    东北区的优抚工作有新的成绩
    北京贫苦烈、军属优先得到生产或就业机会
    东北区积极贯彻第二次全国民政会议决议，在优抚工作上做出了新的成绩。大多数革命烈士家属、革命军人家属和复员转业军人，都在政府帮助下，积极参加生产建设，有的并成为互助合作组织的骨干和工业、农业生产中的劳动模范。仅据黑龙江等省十五个县的三百二十三个村的统计，参加互助合作组织的烈属、军属和复员军人有七千零四十五户，占这些村子中烈属、军属和复员军人总户数的百分之七十八。在长春市郊九个村的干部中，烈属、军属和复员军人占百分之二十二。辑安县七区清沟子村荣誉农业生产合作社的复员军人金泰汉，被选为水田生产队长和村财粮主任，并光荣地获得模范复员军人的称号。
    在组织烈属、军属和复员军人参加生产的同时，各地农村对代耕工作也进行了重点调整，使每一个劳动力负担不超过五个代耕工，克服了过去代耕负担畸轻畸重的现象。各地代耕形式也更进一步和互助合作组织结合起来。辽东、松江两省由互助组和农业生产合作社代耕的土地，占代耕土地总面积的百分之八十到九十。有的县已全部实行由互助合作组织代耕。
    各地还特别注意了帮助烈属、军属、复员军人建立家务，使他们安心生产。辽西等四个省八个县的五十四个村的统计，复员军人百分之九十七有了土地，百分之九十三点三有了房子。热河省围场县和敖汉旗用生产补助费给烈属、军属购买了一百七十头耕牛。有的地区群众并自动教给军属农业生产技术，帮助军属订立生产计划。
    在城市里，各省、市人民政府对组织烈属、军属、复员军人参加生产和就业极为重视。各地对已组织的军属生产单位进行了整顿，还着重组织了老弱妇女、残废军人参加分散的手工业生产小组。沈阳市沈河区组织了两个烈属、军属手工业生产小组，参加的有一百一十六人。他们每人每月都有固定的工薪收入，生活有了保障。目前已有六十户烈属、军属自动要求政府停止补助。　（新华社）
    北京市贫苦的革命烈士家属、革命军人家属优先得到了生产或就业的机会。根据以介绍就业、组织生产为主的方针，今年一月到六月全市介绍到各机关、企业、工厂等部门工作的烈属、军属、革命残废军人就有九百零四人（其中有临时工二百七十八人），连同一九五三年介绍的共达两千五百多人。为了培养烈属、军属的就业条件，北京市从今年四月份开始为烈属、军属举办了文化学习班，参加第一期学习的有一百二十余人。对就业条件较差的则组织他们进行各种小型的手工业生产。城内各区今年上半年除对原有的二十五个烈属、军属生产小组进行整顿外，又组织了一百零三个新的生产小组，参加这一百二十八个生产小组的共有烈属、军属一千二百多人，他们从事洗衣、缝纫、制盒、装订等二十九种生产。这些生产都比较轻便，很多年老的烈属、军属也能参加。为了照顾妇女从事家务劳动，生产小组采取集中领导分散生产的办法。
    烈属、军属参加生产后，生活都得到了改善。西单区太平街参加生产的十户烈属、军属现在已有六户能够自给，四户的生活有了提高。军属边荫芳参加缝纫小组后，全家五口人的生活基本上得到了保障。　（新华社）
