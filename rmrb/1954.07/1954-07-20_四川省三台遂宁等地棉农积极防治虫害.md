Cotton farmers in Santai, Suining, Jintang and other places in Sichuan Province are actively preventing and controlling insect pests. After discovering cotton pests, the Santai County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued an emergency instruction to the district committees on June 10 to eliminate insects and protect seedlings. The district committees also instructed each township to convene meetings of cotton planting experts, mutual aid team leaders, and village cadres to study pest control methods. Liu Ying Township then mobilized more than 1,500 farmers to use "666" powder, cotton oil soap and other pesticides to eliminate insect pests in more than 500 mu of cotton fields within a week. They also hoed the grass twice and applied top dressing twice. The Jiang Qingshan mutual aid team in Hedong Township, Suining County, also put forward the slogan "Eliminate pests and greet the establishment of the cooperative!"; the Hongguang Agricultural Production Cooperative lent pesticides and sprayers to the Pu Dazhi and other four mutual aid teams and other twelve cotton farmers, leading them to kill snout moths. Cotton farmers in Nanmu Township, Jintang County, also created a bamboo tube sprayer, which is both convenient and saves money.

Now, the cotton seedlings in the insect-controlled cotton fields are generally growing neatly, with lush branches and leaves. Cotton seedlings in the areas along the Fujiang and Kaijiang Rivers in Santai County are already two feet high, with generally fifteen to twenty flower buds and thirteen or fourteen fruit branches.

    四川省三台遂宁等地棉农积极防治虫害
    四川省三台、遂宁、金堂等地棉农积极防治虫害。中共三台县委会发现棉花虫害后，在六月十日向区委发出除虫保苗的紧急指示，各区委也分别指示各乡，召开植棉能手、互助组长和村干部会议，研究治虫办法。刘营乡随即发动一千五百多个农民用“六六六”粉、棉油皂等农药在一周内消灭了五百多亩棉田的虫害，还普遍薅了两次草，施了两次追肥。遂宁县河东乡蒋青山等互助组还提出了“扑灭虫害，迎接建社”的口号；红光农业生产合作社把药剂和喷雾器借给蒲大志等四个互助组和其他十二户棉农，带动他们杀死了?虫。金堂县楠木乡的棉农并创造了一种竹筒喷雾器，既方便、又省钱。
    现在，经过除虫的棉田，一般棉苗生长整齐，枝叶茁壮。三台县沿涪江、凯江流域一带的棉苗已长有两尺高，普遍结有十五个至二十个花蕾和十三四个果枝。
