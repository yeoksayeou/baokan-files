The East China region's oil industry is expanding sources of vegetable oil.

Oil factories in Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and other provinces have already produced large quantities of rice bran oil this year, which has been supplied to various regions. East China is a rice-producing area with abundant rice bran. According to estimates from relevant departments, if all the rice bran in the East China region were used for oil extraction, annual oil production could increase by more than 110 million catties, equivalent to saving over 836 million catties of soybeans, worth more than 450 billion yuan. Moreover, the rice bran cake left after oil extraction can still be used as feed, and is convenient for transportation and storage. Recently, the East China Administrative Committee's Local Industry Bureau invited many technical personnel from the oil industry to study methods to further improve the quality of rice bran oil.

A cooperative-owned oil factory in Yangzhou City, Jiangsu Province, began using pumpkin seeds to extract oil in the second quarter. These oilseeds have an oil content of over 34%. Peng Qingyu, a chemist at the Guanghua Chemical Factory in Qingjiang City, Jiangsu Province, discovered that ramie (green ramie) seeds can also be used for oil extraction, and their oil content is about the same as soybeans. The Jiangsu Provincial Company of the China Oils and Fats Corporation has begun purchasing ramie seeds in the Su North region, where ramie is abundant, to supply oil factories for oil extraction. The source of tea oil in Zhejiang Province is also being expanded. This year, the Zhejiang Provincial People's Government planted over 2 million oil tea trees in Wenzhou, Quzhou, and other special districts, preparing to gradually make tea oil one of the province's main edible oils. In addition, radish seeds, tomato seeds, alkali herbs seeds, and other seeds have been proven to have high oil content through experiments. The East China Administrative Committee's Local Industry Bureau recently issued a notice to all provinces, requiring them to immediately conduct a comprehensive survey of local oil resources to provide data for continuously developing new oil sources in the future.

Shanghai's oil factories are systematically learning and promoting the experiences of advanced oil factories, continuously increasing oil yield. The sesame oil yield of the state-owned Shanghai Oil and Fat Factory No. 1 in the second quarter increased compared to the fourth quarter of last year, resulting in an additional production of more than 98,400 catties of oil in three months. Although the soybeans used by this factory this year have a lower oil content, it can still extract more than 13 catties of oil per 100 catties of soybeans, which is 2 catties higher than the oil yield per 100 catties of soybeans at other factories. Currently, this factory has incorporated the new operational improvements from the second quarter into the third quarter's technical organizational measures plan in order to continue increasing oil yield. The state-owned Shanghai Oil and Fat Factory No. 3 has begun to promote the advanced operating methods of Li Chuanjiang from the Northeast Victory Oil Factory. At the same time, a newly added drying equipment was put into production on July 22nd. Calculated based on five months of pressing volume in the second half of the year, the increased oil yield will result in an additional production of oil worth 2.2444 billion yuan. The soybean oil yield of privately owned Dayouyu, Weimin, Datong, and other oil factories has also increased from 11% to 12% in the past. The Weimin Oil Factory, which has the highest oil yield, has reached over 13%. The Shanghai Municipal People's Government Industry and Commerce Administrative Bureau is urging and helping this factory to summarize its experience, preparing to comprehensively promote it among the six private oil factories in Shanghai. After promotion, these six oil factories will produce more than 4,000 dan of oil in the second half of the year with the same amount of raw materials as in the past.

    华东区油脂工业扩大植物油的原料来源
    上海各油脂工厂推广先进经验提高出油率
    华东区油脂工业正在扩大植物油的原料来源。
    上海市和江苏、浙江等省的油厂今年已经生产了大量的米糠油，并已供应给各地。华东是稻米产区，米糠很多，据有关部门估计，如把华东全区米糠都用来榨油，一年可增产油脂一亿一千多万斤，相当于节约大豆八亿三千六百多万斤，价值四千五百多亿元。而榨出油以后的米糠饼仍可以做饲料，运输和储存也方便。最近，华东行政委员会地方工业局邀请了油脂工业的许多技术人员，正在研究进一步改进米糠油品质的方法。
    江苏省扬州市合作社所属的一个油厂在第二季开始用南瓜籽榨油，这种油籽含油率在百分之三十四以上。江苏省清江市光华化工厂化验员彭清豫研究出?麻（青麻）籽也可以榨油，它的含油量和大豆差不多。中国油脂公司江苏省公司已开始在盛产?麻的苏北地区收购?麻籽，以便供应油脂厂榨油。浙江省的茶油的原料也正在扩大，今年浙江省人民政府在温州、衢州等专区种植了二百多万株油茶树，准备逐步使茶油成为全省主要食用油之一。此外，像萝卜籽、蕃茄籽、盐蒿籽等经试验证明都是含油很多的油料。华东行政委员会地方工业局最近已向各省发出通知，要求各地立即全面调查当地的油脂资源，为今后不断开拓新的油源提供资料。

    上海各油脂工厂有组织地学习和推广先进油厂的经验，不断地提高了出油率。国营上海油脂一厂第二季度芝麻的出油率比去年第四季度提高，三个月中多产了九万八千四百多斤油。这个厂今年所用的大豆含油量较低，可是每百斤大豆仍能出十三斤多油，比其他厂每百斤大豆的出油量高二斤。目前这个厂已把第二季度中操作上新的改进编入第三季度技术组织措施计划，以便继续提高出油率。国营上海油脂三厂已开始推广东北胜利油厂李川江的先进操作法，同时新增添的一个烘料设备已在七月二十二日投入生产，下半年以五个月的榨量计算，因出油率提高就可以多产价值二十二亿四千四百万元的油。私营大有余、为民、大统等油脂厂的大豆出油率也从过去的百分之十一提高到百分之十二，出油率最高的为民油脂厂达到了百分之十三以上。上海市人民政府工商行政管理局正督促和帮助这个厂总结经验，准备在上海六家私营油厂中全面推广。推广以后，下半年这六个油厂就将以同样多的原料比过去多产四千多担油。（新华社）
