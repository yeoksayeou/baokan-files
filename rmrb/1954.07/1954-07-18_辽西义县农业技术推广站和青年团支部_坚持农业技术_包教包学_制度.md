The Fifth Agricultural Technology Extension Station of Yixian County, Liaoxi Province, and the Communist Youth League Branch of Yushutun Village have persisted in the "package teaching and learning" system for agricultural technology for the past year, greatly improving the agricultural technology level of all the Youth League members and young farmers in the village. The Liaoxi Provincial People's Government has issued a circular to commend them and called on farmers throughout the province to learn from them. After a year of study, all twenty-seven Youth League members and young farmers in Yushutun Village have learned the techniques of warm water seed soaking, rational fertilization, thinning, manure accumulation, the use of pesticides, and new farm tools. In particular, sixteen people, including Youth League member Jiao Rongkui, have learned more than twenty new technologies, and three Youth League members have become technicians in agricultural production cooperatives.

The Fifth Agricultural Technology Extension Station established the agricultural technology "package teaching and learning" system with the Communist Youth League Branch of Yushutun Village in May last year. They led the youth of the village to study once every ten days. The technology extension workers all used object teaching methods in their lectures. When talking about removing borers and preventing aphids after spring sowing, many people did not believe that removing borers in the spring could reduce insect pests. Technology extension worker Nie Yongsheng used a 50x magnifying glass to allow everyone to observe the aphids growing on the roots of "bitter herbs." After learning, the League members immediately publicized and promoted it throughout the village, which played a significant role in preventing and controlling insect pests. The Youth League members and young farmers participating in the study also organized mutual aid groups and engaged in mutual criticism and self-criticism, and their agricultural technology level also rapidly improved in the process of learning and application.

    辽西义县农业技术推广站和青年团支部
    坚持农业技术“包教包学”制度
    辽西省义县第五农业技术推广站和榆树屯村青年团支部，一年来坚持农业技术“包教包学”制度，使全村青年团员和青年农民的农业技术水平有很大提高，辽西省人民政府特通报奖励，号召全省农民向他们学习。榆树屯村的二十七名团员和青年农民经一年来的学习，都学会了温汤浸种、合理施肥、间苗、积肥、使用药剂和新农具的技术。其中特别是青年团员焦荣魁等十六人已经学会二十多种新技术，有三名团员成为农业生产合作社中的技术员。
    第五农业技术推广站是在去年五月和榆树屯村青年团支部订立农业技术“包教包学”制度的。他们领导全村青年每十天学习一次。技术推广员都运用实物教学法讲课。在讲到春季播种后除螟虫防蚜虫时，许多人不信春天除螟虫能减少虫害。技术推广员聂永升就用五十倍的放大镜让大家观察生长在
  “苦麻菜”根上的腻虫。团员们学了后立即在全村宣传推广，对防治虫害起了很大作用。参加学习的团员和青年农民还组织了互助组，互相展开批评和自我批评，他们的农业技术水平也在边学边用中迅速得到提高。（新华社）
