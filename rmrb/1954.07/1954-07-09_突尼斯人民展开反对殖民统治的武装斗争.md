    Tunisian People Launch Armed Struggle Against Colonial Rule

    [Xinhua News Agency, July 7th] The Tunisian people's national liberation struggle against colonial rule is developing.

    According to news agency reports, in southern Tunisia, a well-equipped and well-commanded Tunisian people's armed force is actively operating. Their familiarity with the terrain and the support of the local nomadic peoples make it difficult for the French colonizers to deal with them. Armed clashes between the Tunisian people and the French army are occurring more and more frequently throughout Tunisia. The Tunisian people frequently attack the French colonial authorities' railways, police cars, and communication equipment.

    Due to the expansion of the Tunisian people's armed struggle, the French government has transferred troops from Algeria, French West Africa, and mainland France to Tunisia to suppress the uprising. On July 2nd, the French government also granted Defense and Armed Forces Minister Koenig the power to indefinitely requisition reserves in Tunisia.

    突尼斯人民展开反对殖民统治的武装斗争
    【新华社七日讯】突尼斯人民反对殖民统治的民族解放斗争在发展中。
    据通讯社消息，在突尼斯南部，一支配备良好、指挥得当的突尼斯人民武装力量正在积极的活动，他们由于熟悉地形，又得到当地游牧民族的支持，使得法国殖民者难于对付。突尼斯各地发生的突尼斯人民和法国军队的武装冲突事件越来越多，突尼斯人民经常袭击法国殖民当局的铁路、警车和通讯设备。
    由于突尼斯人民武装斗争的扩大，法国政府曾经从阿尔及利亚、法属西非洲和法国本土赶调军队到突尼斯进行镇压。七月二日法国政府又给予国防和武装部队部部长柯尼格在突尼斯无限期征用后备军的权力。
