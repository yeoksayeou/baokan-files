Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 20th—Not long ago, the People's Liberation Army coastal defense forces stationed in the Sanmen County area of eastern Zhejiang and the local militia captured nine armed Chiang Kai-shek special agents from Taiwan. Among these agents were Chiang Kai-shek's so-called "Liaison Commissioner of the Ministry of National Defense," "Military Liaison Commissioner of the Ministry of National Defense," etc. They carried rifles, pistols, radio components, etc., and secretly landed on the mainland from the sea, attempting to carry out sabotage activities. Local fishermen discovered these fellows and immediately reported them to the local garrison. The PLA troops and the militia wiped out these bandits in one fell swoop. Some attempted to resist and were killed on the spot.

    捕获偷登大陆的蒋匪特务
    【新华社杭州二十日电】不久以前，驻在浙东三门县地区的人民解放军海防部队和当地民兵，捕获了九名台湾蒋匪武装特务。这些特务中有蒋匪的所谓“国防部联络专员”、“国防部军事联络专员”等。他们携带有长短枪、电台部件等，从海上偷登大陆，企图进行破坏活动。当地渔民发现了这些家伙就立刻报告了当地驻军，解放军部队和民兵把这些匪徒一网打尽，有的企图反抗，被当场击毙。
