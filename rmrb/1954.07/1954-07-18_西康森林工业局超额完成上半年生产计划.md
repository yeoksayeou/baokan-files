Xikang Forestry Bureau has exceeded its half-year production plan by 33.3 percent. The amount of timber transported to Ya'an by the bureau in the first half of this year is double the actual completion of the entire year of last year. Among them, more than 27,000 cubic meters of timber have been shipped to Chongqing, strongly supporting the basic construction in various places.

Having learned from last year's lessons, all work units of the Xikang Forestry Bureau paid attention to strengthening preparatory work at the beginning of this year. In addition to completing the felling tasks in February and March, they also repaired various timber collecting and transporting roads, greatly improving the efficiency of timber collecting and land transportation, so that 80 percent of the annual task was transported from the mountains to the river before the flood season. In addition, the reefs in the river channel were blown up in time, eliminating obstacles to the flow of timber, allowing the timber to be transported downstream smoothly.

On the other hand, after studying the general task of the country's transition period, the workers of various work units and timber yards have a clearer understanding of the relationship between the forestry industry and national construction. They overcame many difficulties in the forest area, persisted in production in the severe cold weather, and launched a wave of technological innovation from April onwards, putting forward more than 30 rationalization proposals, which improved many production tools and operating methods, greatly increasing labor productivity and ensuring the overfulfillment of the half-year production plan.

At present, the workers are summarizing the production experience of the first half of the year and striving to overfulfill the annual plan.

    西康森林工业局超额完成上半年生产计划
    西康森林工业局已超额百分之三十三点三完成上半年生产计划。今年上半年该局运到雅安的木材等于去年全年实际完成数的一倍，其中约有二万七千多立方公尺的木材已流送到重庆，有力地支援了各地的基本建设。
    西康森林工业局各作业所接受了去年的教训，今年年初就注意加强准备作业，除在二、三月份完成了采伐任务外，并整修了各种集材、运材道，大大提高了集材、陆运效率，使占全年任务百分之八十的木材都在洪水期前从山上赶运至河边。此外，还及时炸掉了河道里的礁石，排除了木材流送的障碍，使木材能顺利下运。
    另一方面各作业所和贮木场的职工们经过国家过渡时期总任务的学习后，更加明确认识了森林工业与国家建设的关系，克服了林区里的许多困难，在严寒的气候里坚持生产，并从四月份起掀起了技术革新的热潮，先后提出合理化建议三十余件，使许多生产工具和操作方法得到改善，大大地提高了劳动生产率，保证了超额完成上半年生产计划。
    目前职工们正在总结上半年生产的经验，为争取超额完成全年计划而努力。
