    Thinking of the Past and Today
    Zha Ailan, Director of the Urumqi County Democratic Women's Federation

    I saw the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China in the Kazakh version of the "Xinjiang Daily." When I saw Article 96 of the Draft Constitution, which stipulates that "Women in the People's Republic of China enjoy equal rights with men in all aspects of political, economic, cultural, social, and family life" and "Marriage, family, mothers, and children are protected by the state," I was so moved that I almost shed tears.
    I am a Kazakh woman. My mother died when I was less than a year old, and my father, who raised me for five years, also passed away. When I was seven years old, my brother wanted to marry a wife, but because the family was too poor to afford the bride price, he sold me to Sha Heiti for eight cows. From then on, I became the child bride of Sha Heiti's son, Ha Li, and suffered greatly there. At that time, I was too young to even take care of myself, but I was forced to go out and herd cattle and sheep for the herdboy. Whenever the herdboy vented his anger on Sha Heiti, Sha Heiti would take it out on me, stripping off my clothes and whipping me. Several times, I was beaten so badly that I fled to the woods, afraid to come out. During the day, when I was hungry, I would pull up grass roots from the ground to eat, and at night, I would sneak to the side of a neighbor's tent to sleep for a night. At the age of fourteen, I was forced to marry Ha Li, and my suffering deepened. I remember one summer, I was herding cattle and horses on the grassland. Because I didn't take good care of them, several animals ran into the landlord's field. The landlord found Sha Heiti, and as a result, I was beaten until I was covered in blood and had no good flesh left on my body. My eyes were also beaten until they bled, and my left arm was crippled. That's how I lived through those difficult years.
    I often wondered, when will people like me be able to gain personal freedom? When will I be able to laugh heartily and sing a graceful pastoral song? Thinking of this, my heart felt like it was breaking.
    In the early days of Liberation, I heard that the Chinese Communist Party was rescuing people of all ethnic groups who were suffering. At first, I didn't quite believe it. One day, I was mopping the floor at the Second Normal School in Urumqi (I had escaped from my dark family in 1945 and became a female worker in Urumqi). Yao Wen, the Director of the Xinjiang Provincial Democratic Women's Federation, came to the school and spoke to me kindly, giving me my first taste of human warmth. Later, she introduced me to work at the Municipal Women's Federation. After a period of time, the Provincial Women's Federation introduced me to study at the Cadre School of the Xinjiang Branch of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. From then on, I truly lived a happy life. In the past, I was a despised slave who had never spoken in a gathering of more than three people. Now, I not only have the opportunity to study and work, but I have also honorably joined the Chinese Communist Party. After graduation, I was assigned to work in the Urumqi County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. At first, I didn't know how to work at all, but the leaders were very concerned about me. Every time they gave me a task, they explained it very specifically and taught me methods, and slowly I learned how to work. In October 1951, I was elected as the Deputy Director of the Urumqi County Democratic Women's Federation, and in March of this year, I was elected as the Director of the County Women's Federation. I didn't recognize a single character in the past, but now I can not only read Uyghur and Kazakh newspapers and documents, but also do oral translation. That's how I grew up under the cultivation and education of the Party.
    After seeing the Draft Constitution, and recalling my past suffering, how could I not be happy about the provisions on women's rights in the Draft Constitution? How can I not thank the care of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government? I wholeheartedly support the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China.

    想到过去和今天
    乌鲁木齐县民主妇女联合会主任　扎艾兰
    我在“新疆日报”哈萨克文版上看到了中华人民共和国宪法草案。当我看到宪法草案中第九十六条规定的“中华人民共和国妇女在政治的、经济的、文化的、社会的和家庭的生活各方面享有同男子平等的权利”和“婚姻、家庭、母亲和儿童受国家的保护”条文时，感动得几乎要流出眼泪来。
    我是一个哈萨克族妇女，生下来不到一年，妈妈就去世了，爸爸抚养了我五年也去世了。我七岁那年，哥哥要娶老婆，因家穷得送不起财礼，就把我以八头牛的代价卖给了沙黑提。从此，我就成了沙黑提儿子哈力的童养媳，在那里吃尽了苦头。那时候我的年纪小，连自己都管不了，但是被逼着出去替牧主放牛放羊。逢到牧主向沙黑提发脾气，沙黑提就在我身上出气，脱掉我的衣服就用鞭子抽打。有几次我被打得逃到树林里不敢出来，白天肚子饿了就拔地下的草根吃，到了黑夜就悄悄摸到邻居家的帐篷旁边睡一宿。十四岁那年，我被迫和哈力结了婚，我的痛苦就更深了。记得在一个夏天，我赶着牛、马在草原上牧放，因为没有招呼好，有几头牲口跑到地主的庄稼地里去了，地主找到沙黑提，结果我被打得全身血淋淋的没有一块好肉，眼睛也被打得流了血，左臂被打残废了。我就是这样过着艰苦的岁月。
    我常常想，像我这样的人，什么时候才能得到人身自由呢？什么时候才能爽朗地笑一声和唱一支幽雅的牧歌呢？想到这里，我的心就像碎了一样。
    解放初期，我听说中国共产党是解救各族受灾难人民的，起初我不大相信。一天，我正在乌鲁木齐市第二师范学校擦地板（我是一九四五年从黑暗的家庭逃到乌鲁木齐市当女工的），新疆省民主妇女联合会主任姚文到学校来亲切地和我谈了话，使我第一次感到了人间的温暖。以后，她介绍我到市妇联工作。过了一个时期，省妇联又把我介绍到中共中央新疆分局干部学校学习。从此，我才真正过着幸福的生活。过去，我是被鄙视的奴隶，没有在三个人以上的场合讲过话，现在我不但有了学习和工作的机会，而且光荣地加入了中国共产党。毕业后，我被分配到中共乌鲁木齐县委员会工作。开头我根本不知道怎样工作，可是领导方面对我非常关心，每次给我任务时都交代得很具体，还教给我办法，慢慢的我就会工作了。一九五一年十月间，我被选为乌鲁木齐县民主妇女联合会副主任，今年三月又被选为县妇联主任。我过去一个字也不认识，现在不但能看维吾尔、哈萨克文报纸和文件，而且能做口头翻译了。我就是这样在党的培养教育下成长起来的。
    我看到宪法草案后，回想到我过去的痛苦生活，对宪法草案上的关于妇女权利的规定，怎能不高兴呢？怎能不感谢中国共产党和人民政府的关怀呢？我衷心拥护中华人民共和国宪法草案。
