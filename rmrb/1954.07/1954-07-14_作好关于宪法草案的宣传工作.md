After the publication of the draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China, it was warmly welcomed and supported by the people. Wherever newspapers were read or broadcasts were heard, the broad masses of cadres and many people, based on their personal experiences in revolutionary struggles, realized the importance of formulating a constitution and actively participated in the study, discussion, and promotion of the draft constitution. Many more were determined to greet the formulation of the constitution with practical actions of increasing production and working hard. However, our country has a vast territory and a large population. The news of the publication of the draft constitution will not be able to penetrate all regions of the country in a short period of time, let alone become known to every household. Moreover, formulating a constitution of their own is still a new issue in the lives of our people. Many people cannot immediately correctly understand the significance of formulating a constitution and the specific content of our constitution. Therefore, the publicity work on the draft constitution, which will be carried out among the people of the whole country, should be conducted in a more planned and prepared manner to achieve widespread and in-depth coverage, making it known to every household.

At present, the draft constitution discussion committees of various provinces, cities, and many counties are actively preparing for the publicity work of the draft constitution and actively training reporters and propagandists. In areas where preparations started earlier, the training of reporters and propagandists has already ended, and the publicity of the draft constitution to the people has generally begun. This large-scale publicity of the draft constitution, which is about to begin among the people of the whole country, is taking place just after the vigorous publicity of the Party's general line for the transition period has ended. The publicity of the Party's general line for the transition period has significantly enhanced the people's political enthusiasm and successfully created many publicity experiences. This has prepared good conditions for the publicity of the draft constitution. When carrying out the publicity of the draft constitution, all localities should make good use of the experience of the general line publicity in combination with the specific local conditions at that time. A major successful experience explored by various localities in the general line publicity is to enlighten the masses, based on their personal experiences and the most familiar facts, using methods that are easy for the masses to understand, such as small-scale exhibitions, personal testimonials, and detailed accounting, to help them see long-term interests from immediate interests, overall interests from individual interests, and gradually understand the principles of the general line from several specific facts, and understand their specific tasks in implementing the general line. This successful experience should be fully utilized in the large-scale publicity work of the draft constitution, according to the specific conditions of each locality, with more planning and preparation.

The main purpose of publicizing the draft constitution to the people is to enable the people to understand the significance and content of our draft constitution, to understand how to study and discuss the draft constitution at present, and to understand how to implement and safeguard the constitution in the future. To enable the masses, especially the broad masses of peasants, to have a preliminary understanding of our draft constitution more easily, we can first focus on collecting and using some vivid and concrete materials, starting with explaining one or two issues that the masses can easily understand, and arouse the masses' awareness of the importance of the constitution. For example, we can start the explanation from the role of the constitution, or from the construction of a socialist society stipulated in the draft constitution, or from the rights and obligations of citizens stipulated in the draft constitution. If we want to start with explaining the role of the constitution, we can collect some materials familiar to the masses to explain the two important roles of our constitution, one is "consolidating the achievements and new political and economic victories of our people's revolution and the establishment of the People's Republic of China," and the other is "reflecting the fundamental requirements of the country in the transition period and the common aspirations of the broad masses to build a socialist society." To explain the first role, we can start with what revolutionary achievements we have already obtained. For example, when talking about the achievements of the revolutionary war, we can cite concrete materials to illustrate that the armed forces of the people of the whole country annihilated more than 8 million of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops in the Liberation War; liberated the mainland of the country, overthrew the rule of American imperialism and its running dog Chiang Kai-shek in our country, and established the People's Republic of China. Since then, the people have become the masters of the country and have grasped the power of the country. Later, in the suppression of bandits in the new areas, another 2 million remnants of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits were eliminated; in the struggle against American aggression and aiding Korea, the attack of American imperialism was repelled, and the enemy was forced to cease fire, ensuring the peaceful construction of our country; at the same time, we should coordinate with the materials of the heroic struggle of the local people in the Liberation War, in the bandit suppression battle, and in the struggle against American aggression and aiding Korea. When explaining the new victories in politics and economy in the country in recent years, we can cite national and local materials to illustrate the major victories in land reform, suppression of counter-revolutionaries, democratic reforms in industry and mining, the recovery of industry and agriculture, and large-scale economic construction, so that the masses can understand that these achievements and victories are irrigated and grown by the blood of revolutionary martyrs and our own blood and sweat. It is not easy to obtain them, and they should be cherished and consolidated.

When talking about consolidating our revolutionary achievements and victories, explain that the most reliable way is to formulate a constitution and consolidate it in the form of legislation, and put our revolutionary achievements and victories in the fundamental law of our country so that no one can infringe on it. In order to make it easier for the people to understand why it is particularly necessary to formulate a constitution and consolidate the revolutionary achievements in the form of legislation, we can cite several important laws for explanation, such as the important laws promulgated by the People's Government since the founding of the People's Republic of China, such as the Trade Union Law of the People's Republic of China, the Land Reform Law of the People's Republic of China, the Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China, the Regulations on the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries of the People's Republic of China, and the Regulations on the Punishment of Corruption of the People's Republic of China, etc. Once these laws are enacted, they consolidate the great victories in these aspects in the form of legislation, and ensure that these victories continue to expand and are not infringed upon. The people of the whole country must abide by these laws, and whoever does not abide by them and destroys them is an illegal act and will be punished by law according to the severity of their illegal act. These laws have already played a great role in the lives of the people, but each law only consolidates part of the achievements and victories of the people's struggle, while the constitution is the fundamental law of the country, and all other laws should be formulated according to the principles of the constitution, and no law can violate the principles of the constitution, so it is the fundamental law that consolidates all the achievements and victories of the people's revolution, and it is the most reliable way to consolidate the revolutionary achievements.

To explain the second role of the constitution to the people, we can also use the same method, citing concrete facts to illustrate the socialist economic development of our country in recent years and the bright future of our socialist development; explain that the construction of a socialist society has changed from the ideal of a few advanced elements to the aspiration of the broad masses; and explain that recording this aspiration in the constitution makes the road of national development towards socialism a legal road. After explaining the two major roles of our constitution, we should also use the same method, citing concrete materials to explain the basic content of the draft constitution to the masses, such as the major issues of our country's economic system, political system, and the rights and obligations of citizens stipulated in the draft constitution, so that the masses can have a comprehensive understanding of the draft constitution. The publicity of the draft constitution to the people should be comprehensive and focused, and special attention should be paid to the characteristics of the people of all strata, and different publicity focuses should be used for different objects.

When studying and discussing the draft constitution, reporters and propagandists in various localities should not only seriously study the main spirit and specific content of the draft constitution, but also study and research publicity methods. When reporters and propagandists go to the masses to carry out publicity, they must not simply copy what they have learned. Whether reporters and propagandists carry out publicity in their original units and regions, or go to other units and other villages to carry out publicity of the draft constitution, they must first conduct investigation and research under the unified leadership of the Party organization, talk to some cadres and the masses to understand their ideological situation, understand the central work of the local area, understand the materials of local activities that can cooperate with the publicity of the draft constitution, and even first learn publicity methods from the elderly, folk artists, and local propagandists who are good at publicity among the masses, and study what specific materials, what principles, and what sentences to use for publicity. After doing this kind of investigation and research, make preparations for the concretization of publicity according to the publicity outline, not only should you revise your speech manuscript well, but you can also organize other comrades to draw some pictures, make some charts, and collect some exhibits, so as to increase the effect of publicity when carrying out publicity to the masses. The publicity process of reporters and propagandists publicizing the draft constitution to the people is also a process of continuous learning; it is a process of educating the masses, and it is also a process of learning from the masses. Many facts show that when we are learning, it seems that we all understand, but once you prepare to explain the principles that you think you have understood to others, you will more deeply realize that you have not fully understood, or completely misunderstood. In the specific preparation for publicity and in the process of carrying out publicity to the masses, you will also encounter many more specific and practical problems that need to be studied in depth, and the masses will also have many opinions that will in turn educate us. Therefore, we must pay attention to listening to the opinions and reflections of the masses while publicizing, and constantly improve the materials and publicity methods used when publicizing to the masses.

The publicity of the draft constitution is a major and solemn political task, and we should carry it out with an extremely serious attitude. We should not only pursue superficial fanfare, but should proceed step by step in a planned manner. Whether in urban industrial and mining enterprises or civic districts, or in rural areas, we should first conduct typical experiments, and let the propagandists give trial lectures to the masses, and organize the propagandists to study the trial lectures. After gaining experience, we will fully spread out. When carrying out publicity, we should not only rely on a few cadres and propagandists, but also rely on people's representatives and various activists among the masses. This can expand the publicity force and facilitate the wider and deeper development of publicity.

After the publicity to the masses is carried out in depth, the responsibility of the propagandists lies in helping the masses to conduct discussions in the form of small-scale seminars. In the discussion, attention should be paid to fully promoting democracy and humbly listening to the opinions of the masses. However, the discussion should not be completely separated from the publicity. If the masses have any difficulties in the discussion, they should continue to be explained so that the masses can more clearly understand the significance and content of our draft constitution.

This publicity of the draft constitution to the people is a major political task. It is very necessary for the Party and government leading organs in various localities to attach great importance to it and give specific guidance. The publicity in various localities must be combined with the central work so that the publicity of the draft constitution will not only not hinder production, but will truly become a driving force for promoting production. Whether the political consciousness of the masses can be improved and whether production can be promoted is the standard to measure whether this publicity is done well or not.

    作好关于宪法草案的宣传工作
    张彤
    中华人民共和国宪法草案公布后，受到人民群众热烈的欢迎和拥护。凡是读到报纸或者听到广播的地方，广大的干部和很多群众都从亲身的革命斗争经历中，体会到制定宪法的重要性，积极地参加关于宪法草案的学习、讨论和宣传工作，很多人更决心以增加生产、努力工作的实际行动来迎接宪法的制定。然而，我们国家地域辽阔，人口众多，宪法草案公布的消息还不会在短时期内就深入到全国所有的地区，作到家喻户晓；而且，制定人民自己的宪法在我国人民的生活中还是一个新的问题，很多人对于制定宪法的意义和我国宪法的具体内容，更不是一下都能正确认识的；因此，在全国人民中间将要展开的关于宪法草案的宣传工作，就应该更有计划有准备地进行，才能做到广泛深入，家喻户晓。
    目前，各省、市和不少县份的宪法草案讨论委员会，积极筹备宪法草案的宣传工作，积极训练报告员、宣传员，进行得比较早的地区，报告员、宣传员的训练已经结束，向人民群众进行的宪法草案的宣传已经普遍开始了。这次向全国人民将要开始进行的大规模的宪法草案的宣传，是在大张旗鼓地宣传党在过渡时期总路线刚刚结束以后。党在过渡时期总路线的宣传显著地提高了人民群众的政治积极性，成功地创造了很多宣传经验。这就为进行宪法草案的宣传准备了良好的条件。各地在进行宪法草案的宣传的时候，就应该好好地结合当时当地具体情况运用总路线宣传的经验。各地在总路线宣传中所摸索出来的一条主要的成功经验，就是根据人民群众切身的经验和最熟悉的事实，运用群众容易懂得的方式，如小型展览、现身说法和算细账等等，来启发群众从眼前利益看到长远利益，从个人利益看到整体利益，从若干具体事实逐渐认识到关于总路线的原理原则，认识到自己贯彻总路线的具体任务。这种成功的经验应该在这次大规模的宪法草案的宣传工作中，根据各地的具体情况，作到更有计划更有准备地加以充分运用。
    向人民群众进行宪法草案的宣传，主要目的是要使人民了解我国宪法草案的意义和内容，了解目前如何学习和讨论宪法草案，了解将来如何贯彻宪法和维护宪法。要使群众特别是广大的农民群众比较容易地对我国宪法草案有一个初步的了解，首先可以注重搜集和运用一些生动具体的材料，从讲解一两个群众最容易了解的问题入手，引起群众认识宪法的重要。比如从宪法的作用、或者从宪法草案规定的建设社会主义社会、或者从宪法草案规定的公民的权利和义务等等入手来进行讲解。如果要从讲解宪法的作用入手，就可以搜集一些为群众所熟悉的材料来讲解我国宪法的两个重要作用，一个是
  “巩固了我国人民革命的成果和中华人民共和国建立以来政治上、经济上的新胜利”，另一个是“反映了国家在过渡时期的根本要求和广大人民建设社会主义社会的共同愿望”。要讲解第一个作用，可以从我们已经得到一些什么革命成果谈起，比如讲革命战争成果，可以引用具体材料说明解放战争中全国人民的武装力量消灭蒋匪军八百多万；解放了全国大陆，推翻了美国帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石在我国的统治，成立了中华人民共和国。从此人民成为国家的主人，掌握了国家的权力。以后，新区剿匪，又消灭蒋匪残余二百万；在抗美援朝斗争中打退美帝国主义进攻，敌人被迫停战，保证了我国的和平建设；同时配合引用当地人民在解放战争中、在剿匪战斗中、在抗美援朝斗争中英勇奋斗的材料。在讲解全国几年来在政治方面和经济方面的新胜利时，可以引用全国性的和当地的材料，说明土地改革、镇压反革命、工矿民主改革、工农业的恢复和大规模的经济建设等方面的重大胜利，使群众了解到这些成果和胜利都是革命先烈的鲜血和我们自己的血汗灌溉成长的，是很不容易得到的，应当十分珍贵它，想法把它巩固起来。
    在讲到巩固我国革命成果和胜利时，说明最可靠的方法，就是制定宪法，用立法的形式巩固起来，把我们的革命成果和胜利订在我们国家的根本大法上，不让任何人来侵犯。为了使人民群众比较容易地懂得，为什么特别要制定宪法、用立法的形式来巩固革命的成果，我们可以引用几个重要的法律来作说明，如中华人民共和国成立以来，人民政府颁布了中华人民共和国工会法、中华人民共和国土地改革法、中华人民共和国婚姻法、中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例和中华人民共和国惩治贪污条例等等重要的法律，一经订成了法律，就是用立法形式巩固了在这些方面的伟大胜利，而且保证这些胜利成果继续扩大和不受侵犯，全国人民就必须一律遵守这些法律，谁不遵守它、破坏它，就是犯法行为，就将按其犯法行为的轻重受到法律的制裁。这些法律，已经在人民生活中起了很大的作用，但是每一个法律还只是巩固人民斗争一部分成果和胜利，而宪法却是国家的根本大法，其他一切法律都应该根据宪法的原则来制定，一切法律都不能违背宪法的原则，所以它是巩固全部人民革命成果和胜利的根本大法，是巩固革命成果最可靠的方法。
    要向人民群众讲解宪法的第二个作用，也可以采用同样的办法，引用具体事实，说明我国几年来社会主义经济发展的情况和我国社会主义发展的美好前途；说明建设社会主义社会已从少数先进分子的理想，变成广大人民的愿望；而且说明用宪法把这种愿望记载下来，这样国家向社会主义发展的道路就成为合法的道路了。在讲解了我国宪法的两个重大作用以后，还应当用同样的方法，引用具体材料向群众讲解宪法草案的基本内容，如宪法草案所规定的我国的经济制度、政治制度、和公民的权利义务等等重大问题，使群众对宪法草案能有全面的了解。向人民群众进行宪法草案的宣传既要全面，也要有重点，特别应当针对各阶层人民的特点，对不同对象，要有不同的宣传重点。
    各地报告员和宣传员在学习和讨论宪法草案时，不只要认真学习宪法草案的主要精神和具体内容，而且要学习和研究宣传方法。报告员和宣传员到群众中去进行宣传的时候，千万不能把自己所学的一套照样搬下去。报告员和宣传员无论是在原单位、原地区进行宣传，还是到别的单位，别的乡村进行宪法草案的宣传，都必须在党组织统一领导下，首先作调查研究，找一些干部和群众谈一谈，了解他们的思想情况，了解当地的中心工作，了解当地可以配合宪法草案宣传的活动的材料，甚至先向群众中善于作宣传工作的老年人、民间艺人和本地宣传员学习宣传方法，研究用什么具体材料、用什么道理、用什么话句来进行宣传。作过这种调查研究工作以后，再根据宣传提纲作宣传具体化的准备，不只应该很好地修改自己讲话底稿，而且还可以组织其他同志画些图画、制些图表、搜集一些展览品，以便向群众展开宣传时增加宣传的效果。报告员和宣传员向人民群众宣传宪法草案的宣传过程，也是继续学习的过程；是教育群众的过程，也是向群众学习的过程。很多事实表明，当我们在学习的时候，好像都懂得了，但是一当你准备把自己认为已经懂得的道理向别人讲解时，才会更深切地体会到自己并没有完全懂得，或者完全理解错了。在具体作宣传准备中和向群众进行宣传中，自己还会遇到很多更具体更实际的问题需要深入学习，而且群众也还会有很多意见会反过来教育我们。因而，我们必须一边宣传，一边注意听取群众意见和反映，不断改进向群众宣传时所用的材料和宣传方法。
    宪法草案的宣传是一件重大的庄严的政治任务，我们应该采取极严肃的态度去进行。不能只去追求表面上的轰轰烈烈，而要有计划地一步一步地去进行。无论在城市的工矿企业或市民区，无论在农村，都应当先作典型试验，由宣传员向群众进行试讲，组织宣传员对试讲进行研究。取得经验后再全面铺开。进行宣传的时候，不只是应该依靠少数干部和宣传员，还要依靠人民代表、群众中各种积极分子。这样可以扩大宣传力量，便于使宣传更广泛更深入的发展。
    向群众进行宣传深入开展以后，宣传员的责任在于帮助群众用小型座谈会形式进行讨论。讨论中应该注意充分发扬民主，虚心听取群众的意见。但不能把讨论和宣传截然分开，讨论中发现群众有疑难，还要继续给以讲解，使群众更清楚地了解我国宪法草案的意义和内容。
    这次向人民群众进行的宪法草案的宣传是一件重大的政治任务，各地党政领导机关给予十分重视并给以具体指导是十分必要的。各地宣传一定要结合中心工作，使宪法草案的宣传不只是不会妨碍生产，而且真正成为推动生产的动力。而能否提高群众的政治觉悟和能否推动生产，就是衡量这次宣传作得好不好的标准。
