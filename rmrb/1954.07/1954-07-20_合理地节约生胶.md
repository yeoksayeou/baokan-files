    Rationally Conserve Raw Rubber
    Gao Guangjian
    Rubber has a wide range of uses, with over 30,000 types of rubber products, most of which are crucial accessories for means of production. These accessories are indispensable for developing industry, agriculture, and transportation. For instance, without rubber tires and other accessories, cars cannot run, and airplanes cannot take off and land. Without rubber-insulated wires, flexible rubber tubes, gaskets, and other components, tractors cannot operate. Without rubber transmission belts, conveyor belts, electrical insulation, and many other parts, the mechanization and automation of modern industrial and mining enterprises would be impossible. In addition, raincoats, rubber shoes, bladders for balls, and medical rubber products are all essential for people's material and cultural lives. Therefore, the consumption of rubber is very high. Particularly, due to the rapid development of China's economic construction and the improvement of people's material living standards and cultural level, the demand for rubber is growing rapidly. For example, the amount of rubber consumed by state-owned enterprises in manufacturing automobile tires in 1953 was 7.78 times that of 1949. The proportion of rubber in the cost of rubber products is also very high. For example, in manufacturing an ordinary medium-sized automobile tire, rubber accounts for 53.36% of the raw material cost. It is especially worth noting that China currently cannot be self-sufficient in rubber and needs to organize imports. Therefore, the rational and economical use of rubber is very necessary. It can reduce production costs, increase production, better meet the needs of the country and the people, reduce rubber imports, and save foreign exchange, thereby increasing the accumulation of socialist funds. This is not only of great significance to the development of the rubber industry but also of great significance to the development of the entire national economy.
    The Ministry of Light Industry of the Central People's Government has also made certain efforts to rationally and economically conserve rubber. For example, it has proposed improving the specifications and formulation standards of rubber products, reducing raw rubber consumption quotas, summarizing and promoting the experience of saving rubber and using reclaimed rubber, and researching various rubber substitutes. It has also pointed out the direction, methods, and requirements for saving raw rubber to state-owned rubber factories. With the assistance of local Party organizations and the efforts of the workers and staff of various rubber factories, initial achievements have been made. For example, rubber factories in the Northeast region saved enough raw rubber from April to October 1952 to manufacture over 40,000 medium-sized ordinary automobile tires and over 170,000 pairs of Wanli shoes. This year, the raw rubber consumption quota and raw rubber content rate of products from national state-owned rubber factories have been reduced compared to 1951. For example, the amount of raw rubber used to manufacture each medium-sized ordinary automobile tire was reduced by 0.36 kilograms; the amount of raw rubber used to manufacture each bicycle tire was reduced by 0.05 kilograms; and the amount of raw rubber used to manufacture each pair of sneakers was reduced by 0.13 kilograms, with the raw rubber content rate reduced by 5%. In terms of utilizing synthetic rubber, last year, State-owned Rubber Factories No. 1 and No. 2, and the Shanghai Joint State-Private Da Zhonghua Rubber Factory successfully trial-produced automobile inner tubes using 100% synthetic rubber and rubber shoes using 30% synthetic rubber (relative to raw rubber usage). They also created the experience of using the alkali method to produce better quality reclaimed rubber and using reclaimed rubber to substitute part of the raw rubber. These are all worthy of attention.
    However, we must not ignore the shortcomings that exist in implementing and executing the important task of rationally and economically conserving rubber. For example, the Rubber Industry Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Light Industry lacks regular and strict supervision and inspection of this work, and it has not done enough to summarize and exchange some important advanced experiences. The leading cadres of some enterprises have not combined the conservation of rubber with strengthening the planned management of raw materials, and they only pay attention to this issue when the source of raw rubber becomes difficult and seriously threatens production, or during the increase production and practice economy movement, or when formulating production plans. Among the administrative cadres, technicians, and workers of some enterprises, there is still a tendency to only focus on completing production tasks and neglect conserving raw materials. Therefore, the phenomenon of wasting rubber is very serious in rubber factories. The amount of rubber used by different factories for the same specifications of products varies, and some differ greatly. For example, the amount of rubber used by State-owned Rubber Factory No. 1 last year to produce each larger-sized ordinary automobile tire was 3.82 kilograms more than that used by State-owned Rubber Factory No. 2. The amount of raw rubber used by the factory in the first quarter of this year to produce larger-sized and medium-sized automobile tires exceeded the state plan by more than 0.6 kilograms. Even within an enterprise, the amount of rubber used for the same specification product with the same formula varies at different times. Reclaimed rubber that could be used as a substitute is still not being used, and waste rubber is not being well preserved and utilized. For example, State-owned Rubber Factory No. 7 found many semi-finished products that could be used to make tires in the waste rubber pile, including over ten feet of cushion rubber, hundreds of pounds of mixed rubber, and a small amount of raw rubber. In addition, the waste of raw rubber due to poor product quality, especially due to poorly executed new product trial production work, has not yet received widespread attention. All of these indicate that the potential for saving rubber in our rubber enterprises is still very large, and the claim that "there is no more profit to be made" is not in accordance with the facts.
    The policy of rational and economical use and conservation of raw rubber must be thoroughly implemented. According to the experience and lessons learned from various enterprises in saving rubber over the past few years, to implement this policy, the first thing to do is to improve the quality of rubber products and reduce defective products. Improving product quality can extend the service life, which is equivalent to increasing production and saving raw materials and labor. It can be said that this is the greatest form of conservation. According to preliminary estimates, the improvement in the quality of automobile tires produced by state-owned rubber factories last year saved the country approximately several thousand tons of raw rubber. If the average mileage of automobile tires currently produced is increased from 20,000 kilometers to 25,000 kilometers, then another 20% of raw rubber can be saved. Some comrades in enterprises do not understand the significance of improving product quality for conservation, and they do not conscientiously implement technical operating procedures in production, neglect improving technical operations, or simply sacrifice the rational proportions of ingredients for the sake of conservation, resulting in poor product quality. This is completely wrong.
    To ensure quality and save raw rubber, it is also necessary to quickly and carefully complete the standard design and standard formula of products to eliminate the waste caused by unreasonable design and formulation. The key to implementing this measure lies in learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. With the assistance of Soviet experts, State-owned Rubber Factory No. 1 made some slight modifications to the specifications of large automobile tires, which not only solved the shortcomings in quality that existed in the past but also reduced the amount of raw rubber consumed per tire by 2.5 to 3 kilograms. If calculated based on an annual production of 5,000 tires, it can save 125,000 to 150,000 kilograms of raw rubber. The factory also reduced the thickness of automobile inner tubes according to expert advice and conducted sand screening during the manufacturing process, which not only increased the physical properties of the inner tubes but also reduced the raw rubber usage by 20%.
    Secondly, raw material standards and formulations should be specified separately according to the performance and usage conditions of the products, and the erroneous practice of requiring the best raw materials regardless of product type and performance should be opposed. For example, tires for automobiles and tires for horse-drawn carriages have different requirements for load-bearing, driving speed, and technology. However, in the past, we designed, manufactured, and used the same types and quantities of raw materials for both types of tires, which not only increased product costs and the burden on users but also wasted a large amount of national resources. According to preliminary calculations, if tires specifically for horse-drawn carriages are now manufactured, the amount of raw materials used per tire can be reduced by 10% to 15% while maintaining the existing quality. The Rubber Industry Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Light Industry is currently trial-producing such products.
    Thirdly, the scope of use of reclaimed rubber and synthetic rubber should be expanded to replace part of the raw rubber. Facts have proven that reclaimed rubber is not only inexpensive but can also be used as an independent raw material. Tire bead rubber, cushion tape rubber, the midsoles and sponge soles of rubber shoes, the middle rubber of V-belts, rubber hose rubber, and so on can all use reclaimed rubber in whole or in part. Therefore, all existing waste rubber and reclaimed rubber produced by rubber recycling plants should be fully utilized. In some larger enterprises with reclaimed rubber manufacturing equipment, reclaimed rubber should be manufactured as much as possible to meet the needs of the factory and other factories.
    Finally, strengthen the planned management of rubber raw materials. The planning and production technology departments of state-owned rubber factories should carefully review and formulate the raw material consumption quotas for various rubber products. The supply departments should implement and improve the fixed quota material preparation, quota material distribution, and material return and recovery system, regularly grasp the situation of raw material conservation or waste and analyze the reasons, and conduct timely criticism and commendation to supervise the rational use of materials. At the same time, the storage of raw materials such as rubber should be well-managed to prevent raw materials from deteriorating and reduce losses of raw materials during storage, loading and unloading, transportation, and processing. Waste materials from the workshop should be collected, and finished and semi-finished products tested by the testing institutions should be collected.
    Private rubber industries should also rationally conserve rubber. In particular, factories that produce products that can be made with or without rubber, and factories that produce products that are not currently needed, should take the initiative to conserve rubber. However, the trade union organizations and workers in private enterprises must also prevent capitalists from engaging in shoddy work and cutting corners under the pretext of saving rubber.
    Saving rubber is not only a matter for the workers and staff of rubber factories but also for the workers and staff of all relevant economic departments, enterprises, and users. Users of rubber products should reasonably store and use rubber products based on their performance and specified usage conditions. The proper storage and use of products affect the service life of rubber products. For example, automobile tires of the same specification manufactured by the same factory at the same time can travel over 18,000 kilometers in some areas, while in others they can only travel over 12,000 kilometers. Chen Rongcai, a special-class labor model of Zhejiang Transportation Company, created advanced operating techniques last year that resulted in each tire traveling an average of over 30,000 kilometers. Chen Rongcai's experience is well worth promoting. Zhejiang Provincial Highway Administration renovated 968 tires last year, and the experience of increasing the average mileage of each tire by over 10,000 kilometers due to improved renovation quality is also worthy of attention and promotion. The rubber waste collection departments should do a good job in publicizing the collection work so that, with the conscious assistance of rubber product users, the waste rubber scattered among thousands of users can be collected and the source of raw materials for reclaimed rubber can be opened up.

    合理地节约生胶
    高光鉴
    橡胶的用途很广，橡胶制品共有三万多种，其中大多数都是生产资料的重要配件。这些配件都是发展工业、农业、交通运输业所不可缺少的。例如：没有橡胶制成的轮胎与其他配件，汽车就不能行驶，飞机也不能起飞和降落；没有橡胶制成的绝缘包线，软橡皮管、垫料等，拖拉机就不能开动；没有橡胶制成的传动带、运输带、电线绝缘物、及其他许多零件，近代工矿企业的生产就不能实行机械化和自动化。此外，用橡胶制成的雨衣、水鞋、球胆、及医疗用的橡胶制品，也都是人民物质与文化生活所必需。因此，橡胶的消耗量很大，特别是由于我国经济建设的迅速发展，和人民物质生活和文化水平的提高，橡胶的需要量增长得很快。如国营企业一九五三年制造汽车轮胎消耗的橡胶数量为一九四九年的七点七八倍。橡胶在橡胶制品中所占成本比重也是很大的。例如制造一个普通的中型汽车轮胎，橡胶就占原材料成本的百分之五三点三六。尤其值得注意的，是在目前我国橡胶还不能自给，需要组织进口，因此，合理而节约地使用橡胶是非常必要的，既可以降低生产成本、增加生产，更好地满足国家及人民需要；又可以减少橡胶进口，节约外汇，从而增加社会主义资金的积累。这不仅对发展橡胶工业有着重大意义，而且对发展整个国民经济也有着重要的意义。
    中央人民政府轻工业部对合理而经济地节约使用橡胶也作了一定的努力。如提出了改进橡胶制品的规格及配料标准，降低生胶消耗定额，总结与推广节约橡胶和使用再生胶的经验，研究各种橡胶代用品等；对国营橡胶厂指出了节约生胶的方向、办法与要求。这一工作在各地党组织的协助和各橡胶厂职工的努力之下，取得初步成绩。如东北地区的橡胶厂自一九五二年四月到十月，所节约的生胶就可制造四万余只中型普通汽车外胎，制造十七万多双万里鞋。今年，全国国营橡胶厂产品的橡胶消耗定额和生胶含有率，比一九五一年都有所降低。如制造每个中型普通汽车外胎的生胶用量降低零点三六公斤；制造每个自行车外胎的生胶用量降低零点零五公斤；制造每双球鞋的生胶用量也降低零点一三公斤，生胶含有率降低了百分之五。在利用合成胶方面，去年国营橡胶一厂、二厂及上海公私合营大中华橡胶厂，曾分别试制成功了利用百分之百合成胶制造汽车内胎，利用百分之三十（对生胶用量）制造胶鞋，并创造了用碱法生产质量较好的再生胶和用再生胶代用部分生胶的经验等。这些都是值得重视的。
    但是，现在我们无论如何也不能忽视在贯彻与执行合理而经济地节约使用橡胶这一重要工作上所存在的缺点。例如，中央轻工业部橡胶工业管理局对这一工作缺乏经常的严格的督促与检查，对总结与交流若干重要的先进经验也做得不够。某些企业的领导干部没把节约橡胶与加强原材料的计划管理工作相结合起来，而只在生胶来源发生困难并严重威胁生产的时候，或在增产节约运动中，或在制订生产计划时才注意这个问题。在部分企业的行政干部、技术人员与工人中，还存在着只顾完成生产任务而忽视节约原料的偏向。因此，目前橡胶厂里浪费橡胶的现象是很严重的。同一规格的制品，各厂所用橡胶数量都不同，有的相差很大。例如国营第一橡胶厂去年生产的每只较大型的普通汽车外胎所用的橡胶就比国营第二橡胶厂多用三点八二公斤，该厂今年第一季度生产的较大型和中型的汽车外胎的生胶用量，竟超过了国家计划零点六公斤以上。就是在一个企业内，同一配方的同一规格产品，在各个不同时期里所使用的橡胶也不一样。可用再生胶代替而仍在用生胶，废胶还没有很好加以保存和利用。如国营第七橡胶厂就在废胶堆中找到许多可以制车胎的半成品，其中还有一丈多长的缓冲胶，数百斤混炼胶和少量的生胶。此外，由于产品质量不好，特别是由于新产品试制工作作得不好，而浪费生胶还没有引起普遍的注意。这些都说明在我们的橡胶企业中，节约橡胶的潜在可能性还是很大的，那种认为：“已没有什么油水”的说法是不符合事实的。
    合理而经济地使用与节约生胶这一方针必须彻底贯彻。根据几年来各企业节约橡胶的经验教训，要贯彻这一方针，首先就要提高橡胶产品质量，减少废品和次品。产品的质量提高了，就可以延长使用期限，这就等于增加了产量，节省了原材料和劳动力。可以说这是最大的节约。据初步估计，由于去年国营橡胶厂生产的汽车轮胎质量的提高，大约给国家节约了数千吨的生胶；如果把现在生产的汽车轮胎的平均行驶里程，由二万公里提高到二万五千公里，那么还可以再节约百分之二十生胶。有些企业的同志不了解提高产品质量对于节约的意义，不在生产中认真贯彻技术操作规程，忽视提高技术操作；或者单纯为了节约，不惜破坏配料的合理比例，至使产品质量低劣，这是十分错误的。
    要保证质量和节约生胶，还必须迅速而又审慎地完成产品的标准设计和标准配方，以消灭现存的由于设计和配方不合理而引起的浪费现象。而执行这一措施的关键又在于学习苏联先进经验。国营第一橡胶厂在苏联专家的协助下，对大型汽车轮胎的规格稍作了一些修改，不但解决了过去在质量方面存在的缺点，而且使每只轮胎消耗的生胶量较过去少二公斤半到三公斤，若按全年生产五千条计算，就可节约生胶一二五○○○公斤到一五○○○○公斤。这个厂还根据专家建议，减低汽车内胎的厚度，在制造过程中进行砂选，不但增加了内胎的物理性能，而且可以减少生胶用量百分之二十。
    其次，要根据产品的性能及使用条件，分别规定原材料标准与配方，反对不分产品品种和性能都要求最好的原材料的错误做法。例如供汽车用和供马车用的轮胎，它们对于载重、行驶速度以及技术上的要求，都是各不相同的。而我们过去却把这两种轮胎的设计，制造，及所用原材料的品种，数量都完全一样，这不但提高了产品成本，增加了用户负担，而且也浪费了国家大量资材。据初步计算，如现在专门制造供马车用的轮胎，在保持现有质量的条件下，每只轮胎使用的原材料，可以较过去降低百分之十到百分之十五。轻工业部橡胶管理局正在试制这种产品。
    再次，要扩大再生胶和合成胶的使用范围，以代替部分生胶。事实已经证明：再生胶不仅价格低廉，并且可以当作一种独立的原料使用。轮胎钢丝圈用胶，垫带用胶，胶鞋的中底和海绵底，三角带的中胶，胶管用胶等等，都可全部或部分使用再生胶。因此，应该充分利用现有的一切废胶，返回胶所生产的再生胶。在一些规模较大的，有制造再生胶设备的企业，应尽量制造再生胶，以供本厂和其他厂的需要。
    最后，加强对橡胶原材料的计划管理工作。国营橡胶厂计划和生产技术部门要认真审查和制定各种橡胶产品的原材料消耗定额。供应部门应实行与健全定额备料，限额发料以及退料和回收制度，经常掌握原材料节约或浪费的情况与分析其原因，及时进行批评和表扬以监督合理使用物资。同时，还要做好橡胶等原材料的保管工作，防止原料变质，减少原材料在储存、装卸、运输及加工使用过程中的损失；要收集车间的废料，收集试验机构试验过的成品和半成品。
    私营橡胶工业也应合理地节约橡胶。特别是生产那些可用橡胶也可不用橡胶的产品，生产在目前还不需要的产品的工厂，更应主动地节约橡胶。但私营企业里的工会组织，工人、还要防止资本家以节约橡胶为借口从事偷工减料的行为。
    节约橡胶不只是橡胶工厂职工们的事，同时也是一切有关经济部门企业职工和用户的事。在橡胶制品的使用者方面，应根据某一种橡胶制品的性能和规定的使用条件，加以合理的保管和使用。产品的保管和使用是否适当，影响着橡胶制品的使用寿命。如同一厂同一时间制造的同一规格的汽车外胎，有的地区行驶一万八千余公里；而有的地区则行驶一万二千多公里，浙江运输公司特等劳动模范陈荣材同志在去年创造了每只轮胎平均行驶三万公里以上的先进操作技术，陈荣材同志的经验很值得推广。浙江省公路管理局去年翻修了九六八只轮胎，由于提高了翻修质量，每只轮胎平均增加一万公里以上行程的经验也值得重视和推广。橡胶废料的收购部门应做好收购的宣传工作，以便在橡胶制品使用者自觉的帮助下，把分散在千万个用户手中的废胶集中起来，开辟再生胶原料的来源。
