Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 19th: TASS, Moscow, July 18th: "Pravda" special correspondents in Geneva, Zhukov and Pliushchevsky, published an article in "Pravda" entitled "Disseminators of Confusion."

	The correspondents wrote that in recent days there has been much important work at the Geneva Conference, and the settlement of the Indochina issue depends on the smooth progress of this work. The foreign ministers are temporarily not advocating a plenary meeting of the nine-nation delegations attending the Geneva Conference, but are instead conducting informal talks to study unresolved issues. There is no doubt that these talks are playing a positive role in the Geneva Conference.

	The correspondents wrote that, however, it has been noted that this beneficial work has aroused the anger and extreme panic of certain observers. They do not see their task as accurately reporting the negotiation process to public opinion, but rather as confusing people and spreading chaos that poisons international relations. Encouraged by the "Hotel Roni," where the American delegation is staying, American journalists are constantly predicting the "failure" of the negotiations. The American delegation has, in fact, not participated in constructive conference work during this recent period (Dulles' deputy, Smith, only arrived in Geneva today). In their reports, American journalists are repeatedly, in various guises, raising the infamous Southeast Asia military treaty, which opposes a peaceful settlement of the Indochina issue.

	The correspondents continued, it is not difficult to understand that this kind of behavior has aroused extreme aversion from the general public, especially in France, which is hoping for a peaceful resolution of the Indochina issue at the Geneva Conference.

	Under these circumstances, the creators of confusion are resorting to their usual tricks of obfuscation, attempting to distort the progress of the Geneva talks and trying to convince the French people that there is no way out except to take "urgent military measures" in Indochina, as Dulles resolutely advocates. As previously reported, a certain section of the French press has recently been describing the Geneva talks in hysterical and hoarse tones. They are trying to portray things as if the foreign ministers have encountered irreconcilable differences in their informal contacts.

	The attempt to distort the progress of the Geneva talks in order to sow doubt and unease among French public opinion is in line with the interests of American diplomacy. American diplomacy, as before, is trying to obstruct a peaceful resolution of the Indochina issue. In this regard, one cannot fail to note the news published by the American "Baltimore Sun," which cited Dulles' report to Eisenhower and the National Security Council on July 15 regarding the results of the separate talks in Paris. This news emphasized that "Dulles sees no reason to hope that Mendès-France can obtain a 'glorious' solution in the course of the talks," and that "Dulles does not believe that Mendès-France's premiership will last long." It is not difficult to see that the person writing this news revealed the hopes in his heart.

	The correspondents concluded by writing that, on the other hand, it must be pointed out that the attempts to trap the talks in difficulties and obstruct their normal progress have aroused opposition from French public opinion, and even right-wing newspapers such as "L'Aurore" are calling on their readers not to be deceived by rumors and expressing their firm belief that the Indochina issue will be resolved. The communist newspaper "L'Humanité" exposes the conspiracies of the enemies of peace and firmly insists that the French delegation should conduct talks in accordance with national interests.

	The correspondents concluded by saying that it will soon be seen to what extent the opinions of French public opinion will be taken into consideration.

    混乱的散播者
    ——“真理报”发表驻日内瓦记者的文章的摘要
    【新华社十九日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十八日讯：“真理报”驻日内瓦特派记者茹科夫和普利歇夫斯基在“真理报”上发表了一篇文章，题目是“混乱的散播者”。
    记者写道，最近几天，在日内瓦会议上有许多重要的工作，印度支那问题的解决要靠这些工作取得顺利的结果。外长们暂时都不主张召开出席日内瓦会议的九国代表团的全体会议，而在进行非正式的会谈，在非正式的会谈中研究还没有解决的问题。毫无疑问，这些会谈对日内瓦会议是起着有利的作用的。
    记者写道，可是，大家看到，这种有利的工作引起了某些观察家的忿怒和极度的惊慌。他们不以为他们的任务是正确地向舆论界报道谈判过程，而是迷惑人们和散播毒害国际关系的混乱。从美国代表团所在的“罗尼饭店”得到鼓励的美国记者在不断地预言谈判的“失败”，美国代表团在最近这个时期里实际上没有参加建设性的会议工作（杜勒斯的副手史密斯今天才到达日内瓦）。美国记者在他们的报道中，倒是一次再一次地以种种的花样来提出臭名远扬的与和平解决印度支那问题相抗衡的东南亚军事条约。
    记者接着写道，不难理解，这种行径引起了广大公众的极度反感，特别是在指望日内瓦会议能和平解决印度支那问题的法国。
    在这种条件下，混乱的制造者就使出他们混淆视听的惯伎，企图歪曲日内瓦会谈的进程，并力图要法国人相信：似乎除了依照杜勒斯所坚决主张的、在印度支那采取“紧急的军事措施”以外，别无出路。前已报道，法国的某一部分报纸最近正以歇斯底里的嘶哑的语调描述日内瓦会谈。它们企图把事情说成似乎各国外长在非正式的接触中已碰到了不可调和的分歧。
    力图歪曲日内瓦会谈的进程，借以在法国舆论中间散布怀疑和不安，这种企图是符合美国外交的利益的。美国外交像以前一样，正在力图阻挠印度支那问题的和平解决。说到这里，不能不注意到美国的“巴尔的摩太阳报”所刊载的消息，这个消息引述了杜勒斯在七月十五日向艾森豪威尔和国家安全委员会所作的关于巴黎单独会谈结果的报告。这个消息着重指出了“杜勒斯认为没有理由希望孟戴斯—弗朗斯能在会谈的过程中获得‘光荣’的解决”，“杜勒斯不太相信，孟戴斯—弗朗斯的总理能当很久”。不难看出，写这篇消息的人透露出了自己心底的希望。
    记者最后写道，另一方面，不能不指出，使会谈陷入困境，并阻挠它正常的进展的企图引起了法国舆论的反对，甚至像“震旦报”这样的右翼报纸也号召自己的读者不要受谣言的欺蒙，并表示深信，印度支那问题是会解决的。共产党报纸“人道报”揭露和平敌人的阴谋诡计，并坚决主张法国代表团应按照民族利益来进行会谈。
    记者最后说，不久就可以看出，法国舆论界的意见将受到什么样程度的考虑。
