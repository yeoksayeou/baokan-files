Farmers in Sikang Province have learned the techniques for using new-style walking plows, and they will be used extensively in various locations this autumn.

Based on the needs of the mutual aid and cooperation movement and agricultural production development, the Sikang Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry has made the demonstration and promotion of new-style walking plows one of its main tasks since the spring. It also allocated a portion of new-style walking plows, prioritizing lending them to farmers to teach them how to use them. According to investigations, after demonstration and promotion by agricultural technology extension stations and farms, in only eleven counties and cities, including Ya'an, Lushan, Yingjing, Shimian, Huali, and Luhuo, the incompletely calculated area plowed by farmers using new-style walking plows has already reached over 700 mu. In addition, over 1,100 farmers have been taught the techniques for using new-style walking plows through short-term training classes, field internships, and discussion groups. Land plowed with new-style walking plows is generally ploughed deeper than with old plows, and crops also grow better than those ploughed with old plows. Therefore, many farmers plan to use new-style walking plows extensively this autumn.

In order to ensure the smooth promotion of new agricultural tools after the autumn harvest, the Sikang Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry held a training class for cadres on new agricultural tools in late June to study the use and assembly techniques of new agricultural tools such as new-style walking plows. After graduating at the end of July, they will return to various places to carry out the demonstration and promotion of new agricultural tools.

Recently, the Agricultural and Forestry Bureau of the Southwest Administrative Committee allocated 450 seven-inch new-style walking plows to the province. The Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry has planned to distribute these plows to various counties in the Ya'an and Xichang Special Districts to promote them to farmers during the autumn ploughing season.

    西康省农民在今年秋季
    将大量使用新式步犁
    西康省很多农民学会使用新式步犁的技术，今年秋天，各地将大量使用新式步犁。
    西康省农林厅根据互助合作运动和农业生产发展的需要，春季以来便把新式步犁的示范推广工作，列为主要工作内容之一。并调拨一部分新式步犁，有重点地借给与教会农民使用。据调查，经过农业技术推广站和农场进行示范推广后，仅雅安、芦山、荥经、石棉、会理、炉霍等十一县市的不完全统计，农民使用新式步犁耕的地已有七百多亩；此外，还通过短期训练班、田间实习、座谈会等方式，教会了一千一百多农民使用新式步犁的技术。用新式步犁耕的地一般都比旧犁耕得深，庄稼也比旧犁耕的长得好。因此，有很多农民都打算在今年秋季大量使用新式步犁耕地。
    西康省农林厅为使秋后推广新农具工作顺利进行，已在六月下旬举办了新式农具干部训练班，学习新式步犁等农具的使用和装配技术。七月底结业后，即返回各地进行新农具的示范推广工作。
    最近，西南行政委员会农林局又调拨给该省七吋新式步犁四百五十部，该省农林厅已计划把这些步犁分配给雅安和西昌专区各县，以便在秋耕中向农民推广。
