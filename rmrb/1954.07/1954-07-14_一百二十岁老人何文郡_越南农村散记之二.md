    Old Man He Wenjun, Aged 120
    ——Rural Sketches from Vietnam, Part Two
    Zhan Chao

    Respect for the elderly is a traditional virtue of Vietnamese farmers.

    In the countryside, one often sees scenes like this: a gray-haired old man is given precedence and allowed to walk ahead; if there is a meeting, this old man is invited to sit at the front of the meeting or on the rostrum; if there are disagreements that cannot be resolved, the farmers often ask the elder "patriarchs" to arbitrate.

    However, in a society ruled by imperialism and feudal landlords, there is no talk of respecting the old and caring for the young. Those poor farmers they call "commoners," no matter how old they are, are equally despised and exploited, spending their lives in misery.

    In Renhe Village, Yi'shun Township (Xiang), Yi'an Province, central Vietnam, there is an old man named He Wenjun, whose existence had long been forgotten. It was only in the autumn of 1953, when the Vietnam Workers' Party and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam sent a mass work team to Renhe Village to inquire about the poor and ask about their suffering, that they discovered this old man was already one hundred and twenty years old.

    The news quickly reached the Central Committee of the Workers' Party and President Ho Chi Minh. President Ho personally wrote a letter to the old man and entrusted a cadre of the work team to deliver a maroon Vietnamese-style jacket to He Wenjun himself. This jacket was sewn by the children of Henan Province in North Vietnam, and the words "Respectfully Presented to Uncle Ho" were embroidered on it with red, yellow, and green thread.

    December 15, 1953, was a memorable day. That morning, many elderly farmers from neighboring villages came and gathered around He Wenjun. Just as these old people, who had suffered all kinds of hardships and whose faces were deeply wrinkled, were chatting together, an old peasant woman suddenly walked in. She examined each person's face and asked, "Where is Old Master Jun (the Vietnamese are accustomed to calling people by their given names rather than their surnames, and the special honorific for the elderly is 'Gu,' meaning great-grandfather)?" It turned out that when this peasant woman was fifteen or sixteen years old, she used to take the ferry boat poled by He Wenjun across the river every time she went to the market. At that time, the old man was already nearly fifty years old. The peasant woman had originally thought that the old man was long gone, but when she happened to pass by today and heard that he was still alive and that President Ho had even sent him a letter, she came specifically to visit him.

    In the evening, a grand celebration was held under the auspices of the mass work team. More than two thousand farmers from all fifteen villages in Yi'shun Township came, and representatives from nearby villages and townships also came to participate. The venue for the celebration was set up in a harvested rice field, and the sea breeze blowing from the distance fanned the bonfire brighter and brighter. The old man was brought into the venue by the children playing gongs and drums, and he sat down in front of a large portrait of President Ho.

    The celebration began. The cadre of the work team draped the jacket sent by President Ho over the old man's shoulders, and then read out President Ho's letter. In his letter, President Ho stated that the Vietnam Workers' Party and the government firmly support the just demands of the farmers, fully mobilize the masses, implement the land policy, and realize "land to the tillers."

    The old man was extremely moved and said in a low, hoarse voice: "In the past, I suffered all kinds of hardships and no one knew about it. Now the work team has come, President Ho knows about me, rewards me, and even holds a meeting for me. I feel like a newborn baby, seeing the sun for the first time, and I am really happy! I don't know what to do to repay President Ho's kindness." Then, the old man's youngest daughter—an elderly peasant woman—stood up and said: "Cadres, farmer brothers and sisters! President Ho, the Party, and the government have sent cadres to help us reduce rent, and now President Ho has given my father a valuable piece of clothing. Our whole family is grateful to President Ho." She talked about the initial situation when the work team came to visit, about how the arduous work style of the cadres moved her father and herself, about the suffering her family had endured in the past, and about her determination. She said, "In front of President Ho's portrait, I will only say one sentence: we must sincerely take care of the cadres, and we must participate in the work of mobilizing the masses." This peasant woman, who had endured hardships for fifty or sixty years, although appearing in public for the first time, spoke very movingly because of the true feelings that were aroused from the bottom of her heart.

    The representative of the poor and landless peasants spoke, saying, "The glory of Old Master Jun's family is also the glory of all of us farmers." Finally, the secretary of the township farmers' association spoke, saying, "President Ho's gift of the jacket to Old Man Jun shows the Party and government's concern for the farmers. We must strengthen our unity and oppose the feudal landlords." After speaking, the farmers followed their traditional customs, sometimes singing a folk song in unison, sometimes reciting a simple and enthusiastic poem, celebrating to their heart's content, and did not disperse until ten o'clock at night. The farmers beat gongs and drums to send the old man home.

    That day, farmers from nearby villages also sent many gifts. There was grain, bananas, eggs, and brown sugar. People sent over a bowl of freshly cooked sugar porridge and asked the old man to eat a late-night meal. The old man ate and asked a cadre of the work team nearby, "Nephew! What is this? It's so delicious!"

    In a place rich in sugarcane, a farmer who had worked all his life had never even tasted half a piece of sugar! It is truly heartbreaking to say! He Wenjun's parents sold all three of their children to the landlord because of their poverty. Two of the children died early, leaving only He Wenjun. He could not bear the landlord's beatings and ran away several times, but was caught and brought back. When he was nineteen years old, his mother died and his father's foot was also crippled. He Wenjun asked to go home to support his parents, but the landlord would not agree. Later, after borrowing from all sides, he finally raised seven strings of copper coins and returned the money he had been sold for to the landlord before he could go home. But soon after, he was caught by the landlord to pole a boat, and he also worked as a night watchman, living this kind of life for twenty or thirty years. Later, when the French colonialists came, the landlord made He Wenjun work for them as a coolie, doing hard labor in the Chuan Kuang area of Laos. Once, an officer of the French colonial army beat him severely without asking why, and there is still a scar on his forehead. He Wenjun later secretly ran back from Laos and reclaimed wasteland behind the village. As soon as he opened up a piece of wasteland, the French priest in the Catholic Church came to take a picture, saying, "This land all belongs to the Lord!" and demanded that he pay rent. Later, every time he reclaimed a piece of land, the French priest would seize it. He Wenjun planted nine and a half *chi* of land (a Central Vietnamese *mu*, each *mu* is equal to 7.5 Chinese *mu*), and the French priest forced him to pay three *fang* of rent in the first year (each *fang* is fifteen kilograms), five *fang* in the second year, and nine *fang* in the third year, and later it increased to fifteen *fang*. Regardless of whether the harvest was good or bad, the rent had to be paid in full. In addition to this, he had to give gifts during the New Year and festivals, help with labor during the busy farming season, and run errands for the landlord when there were things to do in the village. In order to pay the church rent, He Wenjun had to endure the pain of borrowing usurious loans, borrowing one *fang* in August and having to repay one and a half *fang* in October. Once, he borrowed twelve strings of cash from the landlord Nguyen Van Do, and although he had already repaid twenty-four strings, the landlord still refused to write off the debt. Later, taking advantage of He Wenjun's illness and fever, the landlord forced him to put his fingerprint on the deed, and as a result, the twelve *chi* of house foundation left by his father was also seized. When He Wenjun was thirty-two years old, he married a female hired worker and had a total of nine daughters, all of whom went out to work as hired laborers. Now, only his youngest daughter, He Shi Zhao, who is sixty-one years old, is still alive. He Shi Zhao had a lover when she was young, but because her family was poor, they could not hold a wedding. The two lived together and had a son. Later, her husband went out to make a living because of the famine and died of illness outside, leaving He Shi Zhao to live with her father and son. They often lived a miserable life of "hanging up the sickle and hanging up the pot," and sometimes they could not even afford sweet potato porridge. Fortunately, He Wenjun had a good constitution and managed to survive until now.

    After liberation, although the He Wenjun family's life has improved somewhat, it has not undergone fundamental changes. Because many landlords who were pressing down on the farmers saw that the situation was not good, they used the signboard of "resisting the war" to sneak into the people's government, where they used various means to distort and sabotage the land policies and laws of the Vietnam Workers' Party and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, in order to achieve their goal of "reducing in name but not in reality" and "giving away land in name but collecting rent in secret."

    In 1953, the Vietnam Workers' Party and the government sent two work teams to pilot the rent reduction and anti-hegemony movement in Taiyuan and Fushou in North Vietnam and Thanh Hoa and Yi'an provinces in central Vietnam. He Wenjun and his family initially turned themselves over in this movement, and his ideal of more than 100 years—to freely cultivate on his own land—will be completely realized in the next land reform movement.

    The day after the celebration, someone from the Prime Minister's Office came to take pictures of He Wenjun. The one hundred and twenty-year-old man put on the maroon jacket sent by President Ho, tidied up his gray beard, and sat upright in a rosewood chair. At this time, his daughter suddenly said as if she had discovered something, "I don't know why my father looks so good today!" A farmer next to him added casually, "After the land reform, Old Master Jun will look even better!" Everyone laughed.

    This one hundred and twenty-year-old man is still living healthily. He will never be able to change his labor habits, and he often asks his daughter or grandson to help him to the small vegetable garden behind the house, where he sits on a stool and weeds. The old man often says to people, "The land is about to return to the farmers! This world is so beautiful!" (Attached picture)

    一百二十岁老人何文郡
    ——越南农村散记之二
    展潮
    敬老，是越南农民传统的美德。
    在农村里，往往可以看到这样的情景：一个须发花白的老人，被大家礼让在前面走；如果是开会了，这位老人便被请到会场前面或者主席台上来坐；要是有什么事情争执不下了，农民们也常请上了年纪的“父老”来裁决。
    但是在帝国主义和封建地主统治的社会里，是不会有什么敬老扶幼可讲的。那些被他们叫作“白丁”的贫苦农民，不管有多大岁数，都一样地受鄙视、受剥削，在痛苦中度过一生。
    越南中部义安省仪顺社（乡）仁和村有一位老人叫何文郡，很久以来人们都已经忘记了他的存在。只有到一九五三年秋天，越南劳动党和越南民主共和国政府派遣群众工作队来到仁和村，在那里进行访贫问苦，才发现这位老人已经有一百二十岁了。
    讯息很快就传到了劳动党中央，传到了胡志明主席那里。胡主席亲笔给这位老人写了一封信，并且把一件酱红色的越南式褂子交托给工作队的干部，让他们亲自送给何文郡。这件褂子是北越河南省的少年儿童亲手缝制的，褂子上用红、黄、绿三色线绣着几个字“敬送胡伯伯”。
    一九五三年十二月十五日，是一个令人难忘的日子。这天上午，邻近各村的许多老年农民都来了，他们团聚在何文郡的周围。正当这些受尽了折磨、每一个脸上都有着深深的皱纹的老人在一起话家常的时候，突然走进来一位老农妇，她一边端详着每个人的脸一边问：“古郡（越南习惯于呼名不呼姓，对老人特别尊称是“古”，即曾祖父之意。）在哪里？”原来这位农妇十五、六岁的时候，每次赶集都是坐何文郡撑的渡船过河的，当时老人已经快五十岁了。这位农妇原以为老人早就不在世了，谁知道今天路过却听说他还活着，并且胡主席还有信寄给他，便特地进来探望探望。
    晚间，在群众工作队主持下举行了一个隆重的庆祝会。全仪顺社十五个村二千多农民都来了，附近的村社也派代表来参加。庆祝会的会场布置在一片已经收割了的稻田里，远处吹来的海风把篝火煽得越来越旺。老人被少年儿童用锣鼓送进了会场，在胡主席的大挂像前面坐下来。
    庆祝会开始了。工作队干部把胡主席送的那件褂子披在老人身上，然后宣读胡主席的信。胡主席在信里表示：越南劳动党和政府坚决地支持农民正义的要求，充分发动群众，贯彻土地政策，实现耕者有其田。
    老人感动极了，用低哑的声音说：“过去我受尽苦也没有人知道，现在工作队来了，胡主席知道我，奖励我，还给我开会。我真像小孩刚出世，第一眼看见太阳，心里真高兴！我不知道用什么来报答胡主席的恩情。”接着，老人的小女儿——一位年老的农妇站起来说：“干部、农民兄弟姊妹们！胡主席、党、政府派干部帮助我们减租，现在胡主席又送给我父亲一件贵重的衣服，我们全家感谢胡主席。”她谈到最初工作队来访问的情形，谈到干部的艰苦作风感动了她父亲和自己，谈到她家庭过去所受的痛苦，谈到她的决心，她说：“在胡主席像前面，我只说一句话：要实心实意地照顾干部，要参加发动群众工作。”这位在苦难中熬煎了五、六十年的农妇，虽说第一次在大庭广众中露面，但是由于从心底里激发出来的真情，她的话讲得很动人。
    贫雇农代表讲话了，他说：“古郡家庭的光荣，也是我们全体农民的光荣”。最后由社农会书记讲话，他说：“胡主席送给郡老人褂子，表示党和政府对农民的关怀。我们要加紧团结，反对封建地主。”讲完话，农民们便按照着他们的传统习惯，时而一领众和地唱一只民谣，时而朗诵一首纯朴和热情的诗歌，这样尽情地欢庆，一直到夜间十点钟才散。农民们敲打着锣鼓把老人送回家去。
    那一天，附近各村的农民还送来了许多礼物。有谷子，有香蕉，有鸡蛋，有红糖。人们把一碗刚煮好的糖粥送过来，请老人吃一顿夜餐。老人边吃边问近旁的一位工作队干部说：“侄子呀！这是什么东西？这样好吃！”
    在盛产着甘蔗的地方，劳动了一辈子的农民竟连半块糖都没有尝过！说起来真是叫人伤心！何文郡父母因为家境贫困把三个孩子全都卖给了地主。两个孩子早死，只剩下何文郡一个人。他因为受不了地主的毒打，好几次逃跑，都被抓回去了。到了十九岁那年，母亲死了，父亲的脚也跛了，何文郡要求回家去赡养老人，地主怎么也不答应。后来东讨西借，好不容易凑够了七串铜钱，把卖身钱还给了地主，才能回家。但是不久，又被地主抓去撑船，夜里还兼带着打更，这样的生活整整过了二、三十年。后来法国殖民主义者来了，地主便让何文郡去给他们当伕，到寮国的川圹地区做苦工。有一次，法国殖民军队的军官不问情由地痛打了他一顿，到现在他的额头上还留着一块伤痕。何文郡后来偷偷地从寮国跑回来，在村子后面开垦荒地，当他刚开一块荒地，天主教堂里的法国神甫就来照相，说：“这些田都是主的！”要他缴租。后来每开垦出一块法国神甫就霸占一块。何文郡种的九分五尺田（中越亩，每亩等于中国七亩五分），法国神甫强迫他头年缴三方租（每方十五公斤），第二年缴五方，第三年缴九方，后来一直增加到十五方。不管年成好坏，一律都要照数缴租。除此以外，过年过节要送礼，农忙的时候去帮工，村子里有事还得给地主去跑腿。为了给教堂缴纳田租，何文郡不得不忍痛去借高利贷，八月借一方，十月就得还一方半。有一回，借了地主阮文度十二串钱，虽然已经还够二十四串，但是地主还不准销账。后来趁着何文郡害病发烧，地主硬拉着他的手在地契上画押，结果他父亲留下的十二尺房基地也给霸占去了。何文郡三十二岁那年和一个女雇工成亲，总共养了九个女儿，全都出去当雇工。现在只有一个六十一岁的小女儿——何氏召还活着。何氏召年轻的时候曾经有一位情人，因为家穷没有办法举行婚礼，两个人同居生了一个儿子，后来她丈夫因为灾荒出去谋生，病死在外面，留下何氏召，跟着她父亲和儿子三个人在一起住，他们常过着一种“挂起镰刀，挂起沙锅”的凄惨日子，有时连红薯稀饭也喝不上。幸亏何文郡的体质好，总算一直熬到现在。
    解放了，何文郡家庭的生活虽说有些好转，但是还没有发生根本的变化。因为许多压在农民头上的地主看到形势不妙，就打着“抗战”的招牌，钻到人民政权里来，在里面用各种手段歪曲和破坏越南劳动党、越南民主共和国政府的土地政策和法令，达到他们“明减暗不减”、“明送田暗收租”的目的。
    一九五三年，越南劳动党和政府派出两个工作团，分别在北越的太原、富寿和中部的清化、义安等省试行减租反霸运动。何文郡和他的家庭就是在这次运动中初步地翻了身，他一百多年的理想——在自己的田地上自由地耕作，也将要在下一步的土地改革运动中彻底实现了。
    开过庆祝会的第二天，总理府派人来给何文郡拍照。这位一百二十岁的老人穿上了胡主席送的那件酱红色的褂子，理了理花白的须发，端正地坐在一把红木椅上。这时候，他的女儿突然有所发现似地说：“我父亲今天不知道怎么这样好看！”旁边的一位农民顺口添上一句说：“等到土地改革以后，古郡就更加好看了！”说得大家哈哈大笑。
    这位一百二十岁的老人现在还健康地生活着，他永远也改变不了他的劳动习惯，时常要他女儿或外孙搀他到屋后的那块小菜园里，坐在板凳上锄草。老人时常对人说：“田地就要回到农民手里啦！这个世界真美！”（附图片）
