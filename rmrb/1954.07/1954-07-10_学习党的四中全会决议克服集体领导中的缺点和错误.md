    Studying the Resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session to Overcome Shortcomings and Errors in Collective Leadership
    Kuandian County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

    After studying the “Resolution on Strengthening Party Unity” of the Seventh Central Committee's Fourth Plenary Session and other documents, we examined the leadership of the county committee in the spirit of criticism and self-criticism.

    Through study and examination, we first realized that to achieve correct leadership, we must strictly adhere to the Party's principle of collective leadership. All fundamental and major issues must be decided after thorough research and detailed discussion by all leading members. In the past, we did not clearly recognize that collective leadership is the highest principle of the Party's leadership. Individual leading comrades, as long as they believed their opinions were correct, believed they were acting in accordance with the Party's policies, and believed they were in line with the local reality, could disregard the Party's democratic centralism and the principle of collective leadership, and make decisions on their own. They even used this individual decision-making to demonstrate their "foresight" and "superiority." Therefore, many fundamental and major issues were often decided by individuals without going through committee discussions. Last spring, when formulating the development plan for agricultural producers' cooperatives, the plan was formulated and deployed by only the deputy secretary of the county party committee and the director of the office after they consulted with each other. As a result, the errors in this plan could not be discovered and corrected in a timely manner. Sometimes, the method of "circulating" documents was used to solve certain major problems. Although the documents were circulated among the committee members, they were often not changed at all; some committee members adopted an attitude of "others stamp, I also sign," and "the majority agrees, I don't object" towards the circulated documents; even if some committee members raised different opinions on the circulated documents, they could not be resolved uniformly. As a result, the "circulation" of documents became a pointless "journey." Sometimes, although meetings were held to solve problems, the discussions were not very good because there was insufficient prior preparation and deliberation. At other times, there was no prior preparation at all. Before the meeting, the committee members were unaware of the central topic to be researched and discussed, or only had a limited understanding of the "topic"; as for what to discuss specifically and how to discuss it, it was unclear, and they could only sit and "listen to the meeting." This approach actually canceled the thinking process required for committee members to research and discuss issues, affecting their thinking, causing some committee members to remain silent, some to be taciturn, and even those who did speak often talked about feelings and experiences, rambling on and on, making it difficult to discuss the issues systematically and deeply, and to reach correct conclusions. On the other hand, there was also serious decentralism in the leadership of the county committee. Some committee members believed that they were more "familiar" with the work of their departments, "understood more," and that other committee members were "unfamiliar" with these tasks and were "laymen," so they believed that the instructions they drafted or the experiences they summarized were "more or less right" and did not need to be researched and discussed by other committee members. They even thought that even if they were discussed, it would be "repetitive" and "nothing could be raised." Therefore, many fundamental and major issues were arranged after only the department leaders and the party committee secretary consulted with each other, forming a situation of "one person decides, everyone follows." Although some important issues were also submitted to the committee for discussion, it was often done from the perspective of "preparing for future troubles." Once a mistake occurred, they could say "it was researched by the party committee" to shirk their responsibilities.

    After studying the resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session, we clearly understood the relationship between collective leadership and division of labor with individual responsibility. The division of labor among the committee members must be a division of labor under the unified leadership of the committee and should not be each going their own way. In the past, we had an unclear understanding of the consistency and integrity between the work of the departments and the entire work of the party committee, and we opposed the two. Some committee members believed that doing a good job in their department was their "sole responsibility," and that if they did work outside of their department, it would be "meddling" and "not doing their job properly." Some committee members mistakenly believed that if the work of the department was done poorly, it would be "shameful," while if the overall work of the party committee was not done well, it had nothing to do with them. For example, some committee members were not enthusiastic about the discussion of agricultural production issues because they were not responsible for agricultural production work, rarely expressing their opinions, and even unwilling to attend such meetings at all. Some committee members felt that they were relatively young among all the leading members and had joined the party committee for a relatively short period of time. Therefore, they mistakenly believed that the overall work of the party committee was the responsibility of the secretary and the standing committee, and that they could "intervene less," and even regarded insisting on principled debates at party committee meetings as "arguing for the sake of arguing" and "seizing power," and often adopted an attitude of "echoing" towards the discussion of major issues. Due to the existence of the above-mentioned incorrect ideas, the activities of the party committee members all fell into the small circle of narrow departmental work. A state of "division" and "separation" was formed between the committee members and the secretary, and between the committee members, greatly weakening the role of the Party's collective leadership.

    After studying and examining, the county committee believes that to change the current situation and strengthen the collective leadership of the party committee, we must first thoroughly criticize everyone's erroneous understanding of collective leadership, eliminate all confused ideas about collective leadership, and strengthen the sense of responsibility of each leading member for the cause of the Party. Every committee member must not only do a good job in their own department, but also participate in the overall leadership work of the party committee. In addition, it is also necessary to establish and improve the meeting system of the party committee. In the future, whether it is a major issue of central work or departmental work, it must be discussed at the plenary session of the Party Committee or at the Standing Committee of the Party Committee, and a formal resolution must be made, and then the division of labor will be responsible for implementation. During or after the completion of a task, the committee must promptly listen to the report of the responsible committee member to supervise and inspect the implementation of the resolution. The Party Committee believes that this is a specific measure to prevent individual monopoly and implement collective leadership. To this end, the Party Committee stipulates that a plenary session of the committee members must be held twice a month, and a meeting of the Standing Committee must be held three times a month. The central topic of each meeting must be notified to the committee members in advance. For discussions and resolutions on major issues or specialized issues, relevant committee members may be entrusted to draft written materials and distribute them to the committee members in advance to fully prepare opinions.

    After studying the resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session, we also realized that strengthening the Party's collective leadership requires fully developing intra-Party democracy and carrying out criticism and self-criticism. This is an important guarantee for realizing collective leadership. In the past, we also had an unclear understanding of this. Therefore, the democratic life of the Party Committee itself was not normal enough. For example, some committee members were only satisfied with the current state of unity of the county party committee, but did not see the shortcomings in everyone's thinking and work style, and mistakenly believed that everyone was a leading cadre, and their levels were "not much different," and no one was much more "superior" than anyone else, so it was impossible to carry out criticism and self-criticism. Some committee members also treated the cause of the Party with individualism. Although they clearly saw some phenomena that violated the Party's collective leadership and were dissatisfied, they did not conduct criticism. Without criticism and self-criticism, the ideological education of party member cadres became weak and powerless, causing the activities of some party member cadres to violate the Party's policies and organizational discipline, and nurturing bourgeois individualism. For example, some party member cadres forgot the humble attitude that communist party members must possess, ignored the role of the Party and the masses, and regarded work achievements as personal merit, arrogant and boastful, looked down on the work of others, saying that they were "serving the people," while cadres from other departments were "eating for nothing." Without criticism and self-criticism, the liberal atmosphere of the Party Committee was quite strong. If there were disagreements between each other, they were not put on the table to be resolved according to Party principles, but were discussed behind their backs, spreading an atmosphere of dissatisfaction. To this end, the county committee plans to regularly summarize work in the future, carry out criticism and self-criticism through summarizing work, timely check the shortcomings of the county committee in leadership thinking and work style, seriously treat errors, and integrate criticism and self-criticism into daily work and life. We will regularly wage struggles against subjectivism and decentralism that hinder collective leadership.

    学习党的四中全会决议克服集体领导中的缺点和错误
    中共宽甸县委会
    学习党的七届四中全会“关于增强党的团结的决议”等文件后，我们以批评和自我批评的精神，检查了县委会的领导。
    经过学习与检查，首先使我们认识到，要实现正确的领导，必须严格地遵守党的集体领导原则，一切原则性的重大问题，必须经过全体领导成员深刻研究和详细讨论后作出决定。过去，我们没有明确地认识到集体领导是党的领导的最高原则。个别领导同志只要他的意见自以为是对的，自以为是按照党的政策办事、自以为是符合当地实际情况，就可以不遵守党的民主集中制和集体领导的原则，就可以个人决定问题。并用这种个人决定问题来表现自己有“先见之明”，表现自己“高明”。因此，许多原则性的重大问题，往往不经过委员会讨论，个人便作出了决定。去年春天，在制定农业生产合作社的发展计划时，就是由县委副书记和办公室主任二人商量一下，便往下布置。结果这个计划中的错误，未能及时发现和纠正。有时对某些重大问题采用“传阅”文件的方式来解决。文件虽经各委员传阅了，却往往一字未改；有的委员对传阅文件抱着“别人盖章，我也签字”，“多数同意，我不反对”的态度；即使有的委员对传阅的文件提出不同的意见，也得不到统一的解决。结果使文件的“传阅”形成了无谓的“旅行”。有时虽然也召开会议来解决问题，但因事前充分酝酿准备不够，讨论得不太好。也有时事前根本没有酝酿准备，会议上所要研究讨论的中心议题，开会前各委员还一无所知，或即是知道也仅限于“题目”上的了解；至于具体讨论什么和怎样讨论就不清楚，只有坐着“听会”。这种作法，实际上是取消了各委员研究讨论问题所需的思索过程，影响各委员的思考，致使有的委员默不作声，有的委员沉默寡言，有的委员即是发言，也多属谈感觉和讲体会，东扯西拉，对问题的讨论当然难以系统深刻，作出正确的结论。另一方面，县委会的领导上还存在着严重的分散主义。有的委员自以为对自己部门的工作比较“熟悉”了，“懂得多一些”，说别的委员对这些工作“生疏”，都是
  “外行”，便认为自己起草的指示或总结出来的经验“差不多少”，不需要经过其他委员们的研究和讨论了，甚至认为即使讨论，也是“重复”，“提不出什么问题”。因此，有许多原则性的重大问题，仅由部门领导人和党委书记商量一下，便布置下去了，形成“一人决定，大家照办”。有些重要问题，虽然也提交委员会讨论，但也往往是从“以备后患”出发，一旦出了差错时，便可以说“经过党委研究啦”，以推卸自己的责任。
    经过学习四中全会决议，我们明确地认识了集体领导与分工负责的关系。各委员的分工必须是在委员会统一领导下的分工，而不应各行其是。过去，我们对部门工作与党委全部工作的一致性和整体性认识不清，把两者对立起来了。有的委员认为把部门工作作好，是自己“唯一的责任”，如果去作自己部门以外的工作，便是“多管闲事”和“不务正业”。有的委员更错误地认为，如果部门工作搞坏了是“丢人”，而党委的全面工作做不好，则与自己无关。比如有的委员因为没有负责管农业生产工作，对农业生产问题的讨论，便不热心，很少发表意见，甚至根本不愿去参加这类会议。也有的委员感觉自己在全体领导成员中比较年青，参加党委的时间又较短，因此，误认为党委的全面工作有书记和常委负责，自己可以“少伸手”，甚至把在党委会议上坚持原则性的辩论，当成是“强词夺理”，是“夺权”，对重大问题的讨论，也就常常抱着“随声附和”的态度。由于存在以上这些不正确的想法，结果使党委委员的活动，全陷入狭隘的部门工作的小圈子里了。委员和书记之间，委员和委员之间，形成了“分裂”和“割据”状态，大大减弱了党的集体领导的作用。
    经过学习检查以后，县委会认为，要改变目前这种状况，加强党委的集体领导，首先要彻底批判大家对集体领导的错误认识，消除对集体领导的一切糊涂思想，加强每个领导成员对党的事业的责任心。每一个委员不仅要作好自己部门的工作，同时要参加党委的全面领导工作。除此以外，还必须建立和健全党委会的会议制度。以后无论中心工作或部门工作的重大问题，都必须在党的全体委员会上或者党委的常委会上讨论，作出正式决议，然后分工负责执行。在一项工作过程中或工作完毕后，委员会必须及时听取负责委员的汇报，以监督和检查对决议的执行。党委会认为，这是防止个人包办，贯彻集体领导的具体措施。为此，党委会规定，每月必须召开两次全体委员会议，三次常务委员会议。每次会议的中心议题，必须事前通知各委员，凡是对重大问题或专门问题的讨论和决议，可委托有关委员负责起草书面材料，预先分发各委员，以便充分准备意见。
    经过学习四中全会决议，我们还认识到，加强党的集体领导，还必须充分发扬党内民主，开展批评和自我批评。这是实现集体领导的一项重要保证。过去，我们对此也是认识不清的。因而党委会本身的民主生活就不够正常。比如有的委员仅满足于县委团结的现状，而看不到大家在思想上和作风上还存在着的若干缺点，错误地认为大家都是领导干部，水平都“相差不大”，谁也不比谁“高明”多少，无法开展批评和自我批评。也有的委员以个人主义来对待党的事业，明明看到某些违反党的集体领导的现象，心中虽然不满，但是也不进行批评。批评和自我批评不开展，对党员干部的思想教育工作，变得软弱无力，致使有些党员干部的活动违反了党的政策和组织纪律，滋长着资产阶级的个人主义。比如，有的党员干部便忘记了共产党员必须具备的谦逊态度，漠视党和群众的作用，而把工作成绩看做是个人的功劳，自高自大，夸夸其谈，看不起别人的工作，说自己是“为人民服务”，而别的部门的干部则是“白吃饭”。批评和自我批评不开展，党委会的自由主义空气相当浓厚，互相之间有意见，不摆到桌面上根据党的原则去解决，而是在背后议论纷纷，散布不满空气。为此，县委会计划今后定期总结工作，通过总结工作，开展批评和自我批评，及时检查县委会在领导思想上、作风上的缺点，严肃对待错误，并将批评和自我批评贯穿到日常工作和生活中去。经常向一切妨碍集体领导的主观主义和分散主义进行斗争。
