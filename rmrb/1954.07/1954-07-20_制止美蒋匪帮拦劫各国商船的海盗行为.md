    Stop the Piratical Acts of the American-Chiang Kai-shek Gang in Intercepting Merchant Ships of Various Countries
    Hu Sisheng
    In recent years, the American warmongering clique has supported and directed the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Taiwan to intercept merchant ships of various countries sailing on the high seas, a piratical act that is an integral part of the American policy of hostility and aggression against the People's Republic of China. It threatens navigational safety in the Far East, obstructs trade between countries and Asia, and blatantly tears up one of the basic principles of international law with a long history – the principle of freedom of navigation.
    International law clearly stipulates that no part of the high seas may be treated as a country's territory and placed under its sovereignty; all countries in the world have the freedom to use the high seas. This is necessary for the normal development of international relations and is a prerequisite for maintaining normal relations between countries.
    However, since 1950, when the United States government violated the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation, forcibly occupied Taiwan, our territory, as a military base for American aggression against the People's Republic of China and threatening Asian security, and unscrupulously carried out increasingly rampant piratical activities, the freedom of navigation of various countries on the high seas in the Far East has lost its guarantee. Since 1950, ships from major shipping countries in the world, including merchant ships from the United Kingdom, Denmark, Norway, Italy, Portugal, the Netherlands, Panama, Greece, West Germany, Poland, and the Soviet Union, have been subjected to piratical attacks by the American-Chiang Kai-shek gang on the high seas near Taiwan. In recent years, dozens of merchant ships from various countries have been looted, including forty British merchant ships. For example, in 1952, the main British merchant ships that were attacked included the "San George," the "Greno Venn," the "Inchislay," and the "Rosita," which belonged to the "Kafong Shipping Company." The "Rosita" was even subjected to armed attacks multiple times within a year. On December 1, 1952, the "Rosita" was attacked, with bullet holes all over the ship, and the captain was killed; on November 8 of the following year, the "Rosita" was again attacked by American-Chiang Kai-shek gunboats. In 1953, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' piratical acts became even more frequent. The British merchant ship "Ingo Jaffa" was intercepted on August 23, and the next day, another British cargo ship, the "Negro Lock," was attacked by Chiang Kai-shek gunboats; in October, the British cargo ship "Pennis" was intercepted, and in November, the British cargo ship "Hadra Lock," belonging to "Wheelock Marden & Company Limited," was not only attacked by American-Chiang Kai-shek bandit warships, but also subjected to several air raids. Recently, in mid-July, the British merchant ship "Hubei" was again illegally intercepted and searched by two American-Chiang Kai-shek bandit warships, and was chased for three hours.
    People can see from this that the piratical behavior of the American-Chiang Kai-shek gang has reached a point of utter lawlessness. They completely disregard the basic principles of international law, and they have completely become international pirates who kill and loot on the high seas.
    The purpose of the American-Chiang Kai-shek gang's blatant destruction of freedom of navigation on the high seas through these piratical acts is to obstruct the restoration and development of trade relations between various countries and the People's Republic of China, and to create international tension.
    As everyone knows, after the United States government occupied Taiwan, it then manipulated the United Nations General Assembly to pass an illegal resolution on imposing an "embargo" on our country. The United States wants to use "blockade" and "embargo" to stifle the strong development of People's China. However, the facts of the past few years have clearly shown that the short-sighted American politicians are completely wrong. The economic mutual assistance and cooperation between our country and the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries are developing more and more prosperously. Anyone with eyes can see that the People's Republic of China is confidently marching forward on the road of large-scale construction of socialist industrialization.
    Conversely, "blockade" and "embargo" have harmed the policy implementers themselves, especially the countries that are forced to participate in the "embargo." These countries are increasingly unable to tolerate this American policy of harming others to benefit oneself. Many far-sighted politicians and business people from various countries have called for measures to break through the "embargo" and conduct trade with People's China. Under these circumstances, despite the American "embargo," since 1952, the trend of trade between China and capitalist countries has still been rising. Since the Geneva Conference, representatives from industrial and commercial circles in the United Kingdom, Italy, France, West Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, and the Netherlands have successively gone to Geneva and our delegation to discuss the development of trade. Our trade delegation was invited to visit the United Kingdom, Belgium, and Indonesia. Trade delegations from some countries will also visit our country.
    All of this obviously does not suit the taste of the American ruling clique. They are very afraid that countries will establish normal relations with our country, and are stepping up their efforts to obstruct the development of trade relations between various countries and our country. The piratical acts of the American-Chiang Kai-shek gang in intercepting merchant ships of various countries have also intensified. According to Associated Press reporter Musa, on July 13, Chiang Kai-shek's "senior officials" openly issued provocative threats, stating that they would continue to loot ships of various countries. At the same time, the American authorities recently transferred two destroyers and three patrol boats to Chiang Kai-shek, and will soon continue to give him six warships and a batch of jet aircraft. It is also said that Van Fleet may also suggest expanding the scope of activities of the U.S. Seventh Fleet to certain islands off the Chinese coast.
    Under the serious condemnation of world public opinion, the American authorities have tried their best to deny that it has anything to do with this piratical behavior, and have attempted to shirk the serious responsibility it should bear. After the Polish merchant ship "Bracka" was looted, the American government shamelessly said in response to the Polish government's protest: "The United States government categorically...denies the accusations in the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs' note, and hopes to indicate to the Polish government that the United States government has nothing to do with the 'Bracka' interception incident." The blatant act of the U.S. Navy intercepting the Soviet merchant ship "Tuapse" on the high seas south of Taiwan on June 23, the American government also said that it had nothing to do with it. However, this is a shameless denial. As everyone knows, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Taiwan are protected and supported by the American naval forces and are at the command of their American masters. The weapons, warships, aircraft, and ammunition of the Chiang Kai-shek remnants are all equipped and supplied by the United States and are under the command of the Pentagon. All the piratical acts of intercepting merchant ships are also carried out in the sea area controlled by the U.S. Seventh Fleet, with the direct participation and assistance of the U.S. naval and air forces. According to a United Press dispatch from Singapore on March 13, 1953: "A senior officer on the Norwegian freighter 'Taille Fair' said that U.S. planes continue to 'tail' foreign ships passing through the Taiwan Strait...U.S. planes monitor the ship day and night. He said: 'During the day, they circled over us, obviously wanting to find out our identity. One night, a plane shined a bright light on our ship, and flew away after seeing the flag clearly.'" It is very clear that the American warmongering clique is the real culprit behind this piratical behavior.
      At the same time, people cannot fail to notice that McCarthy, the chairman of the U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, has repeatedly clamored to "investigate" and prevent ships from Western European countries from trading with our country. Van Zandt, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives Armed Services Committee, also claimed to "prevent" ships from the United Kingdom, Panama, Poland, and Norway from entering "ports such as Shanghai, Macau, and Shantou." Therefore, the American authorities cannot escape the responsibility they should bear for this piratical behavior.
    The American warmongering clique's occupation of Taiwan and directing the Chiang Kai-shek bandits to intensify their piratical activities not only harms the shipping and trade interests of many countries, but also threatens peace in Asia and the world. The late American President Roosevelt once made a speech to the American people after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, pointing out: "Where bandit methods are prevalent, the safety of any country or any person is not guaranteed." Today, these words have become a powerful indictment against the American government, which is directing the Chiang Kai-shek bandits to intercept merchant ships and undermine freedom of navigation.
    The Chinese people and the people of the world, as well as all countries that are willing to act in accordance with their own national interests, cannot tolerate the piratical acts of the American-Chiang Kai-shek gang and must severely crack down on the American-Chiang Kai-shek pirate bandits.

    制止美蒋匪帮拦劫各国商船的海盗行为
    胡思升
    最近几年来，美国好战集团支持和指使台湾蒋匪拦劫航行在公海上的各国商船的海盗行为，是美国推行敌视和侵略中华人民共和国的政策的一个组成部分。它威胁远东的航行安全、阻挠各国和亚洲的贸易往来，明目张胆地把有悠久历史的国际法的基本准则之一——航海自由的原则撕毁无遗了。
    国际法明确地规定，公海的任何部分都不得作为一国的领域而置于其主权之下；世界各国都有使用公海的自由。这是国际关系正常发展所必需的，而且是保持各国正常关系的必要条件。
    但是，自从一九五○年美国政府违反开罗宣言和波茨坦公告，强占我国领土台湾作为美国侵略中华人民共和国和威胁亚洲安全的军事基地，肆无忌惮地进行日益猖狂的海盗活动以来，各国在远东公海上的航海自由就失去了保证。从一九五○年起，世界主要航运国家的船只，包括英国、丹麦、挪威、意大利、葡萄牙、荷兰、巴拿马、希腊、西德、波兰和苏联等国的商船，都在台湾附近的公海海面上受到美蒋匪帮的海盗攻击。几年来被劫夺的各国商船达数十艘，其中英国的商船有四十艘。例如在一九五二年，遭到攻击的主要的英国商船就有“桑·乔治”号、“格里诺文”号、“英契斯雷”号以及属于“卡丰轮船公司”的“罗西塔”号。其中“罗西塔”号在一年的时间中甚至多次遭到武装攻击。在一九五二年十二月一日，“罗西塔”号被袭击，船身弹痕累累，船长被击毙命；次年十一月八日“罗西塔”号又遭到美蒋炮舰的袭击。在一九五三年，蒋匪海盗行径更为频繁，英国商船“英乔伐”号在八月二十三日遭到拦劫，而次日，另一艘英国货船“尼格洛克”号又遭到了蒋匪炮舰的袭击；十月，英国货船“佩尼斯”号遭到拦击，十一月，属于“惠洛克·马登轮船有限公司”的英国货船“哈得拉洛克”号不仅遭到了美蒋匪帮军舰的袭击，而且遭到数度的空袭。最近，七月中旬，英国商船“湖北”号又遭到美蒋匪帮两艘军舰的非法拦劫和搜查，并被追逐达三小时之久。
    人们由此看到，美蒋匪帮的海盗行为已经到了无法无天的地步，他们完全不把国际公法的基本准则放在眼里，他们已经完全成了在公海上杀人越货的国际海盗。
    美蒋匪帮这种粗暴的破坏公海航行自由的海盗行为，已引起了各国公众和舆论的普遍愤怒。苏联政府和波兰政府曾先后数度照会美国对美蒋拦劫苏、波两国商船的海盗行为提出强硬的抗议。英国公众的愤怒情绪也经常反映到英国国会中。英国前工党外交大臣摩里逊一九五三年二月五日在下院发言时表示：“英国不能容许蒋介石这种干预行动，英国商船队应该得到……保护。”为了保护英国对外贸易的利益和英国商船的安全，英国政府不得不下令英国舰队保护英联邦国家商船的航行安全。英国外交大臣艾登于一九五三年二月十六日在下院宣布，英国政府已命令“英国皇家海军保护从事在公海上航行的英国商船”。
    很显然，美蒋匪帮进行这种无法无天的海盗行为的目的，是想借以阻挠各国恢复和发展与中华人民共和国的贸易关系，制造国际紧张局势。
    大家知道，美国政府侵占台湾以后，接着又操纵联合国大会通过了对我国实行“禁运”的非法决议。美国想用“封锁”“禁运”来窒息人民中国的强大发展。但是数年来的事实已经确凿地表明，短视的美国政客们是完全错了。我国与苏联、人民民主国家之间的经济互助合作关系，日益繁荣地发展起来。现在有眼睛的人都看得见，中华人民共和国正满怀信心地在大规模建设社会主义工业化的道路上迈步前进。
    相反地，“封锁”和“禁运”却损害了政策执行者自己，特别是被强迫参加“禁运”的国家。这些国家越来越不能忍受美国这种损人利己的政策，许多有远见的各国政界人士和工商界人士纷纷要求采取措施冲破“禁运”，和人民中国进行贸易。在这种情况下，尽管美国实行“禁运”，从一九五二年开始，中国与资本主义国家之间的贸易的趋势仍然是上升的。自日内瓦会议召开以来，英国、意大利、法国、西德、瑞士、比利时和荷兰等国的工商业界代表都先后前往日内瓦和我国代表团商谈发展贸易的问题。我国贸易代表团应邀访问英国、比利时和印度尼西亚。有些国家的贸易代表团也将访问我国。
    这一切显然都不合美国统治集团的胃口。他们十分害怕各国和我国建立正常的关系，正在加紧阻挠各国和我国贸易关系的发展，美蒋匪帮拦劫各国商船的海盗行为也变本加厉了。据美联社记者穆萨透露，七月十三日，蒋匪的“高级官员”公然发出挑衅性的威胁，表示将继续劫夺各国的航运船只。与此同时，美国当局又在最近移交给蒋介石两艘驱逐舰和三艘巡逻艇，并且不久将继续给他六艘军舰和一批喷气式飞机。同时据说，范佛里特还将可能建议把美国第七舰队的活动范围扩大到中国海岸的某些岛屿。
    在世界舆论的严正指责下，美国当局竭力否认它和这种海盗行为有关系，妄图推卸它所应负的严重责任。在波兰商船“布拉卡”号被劫夺以后，美国政府在答复波兰政府的抗议中竟然厚颜无耻地说：“美国政府断然……否认波兰外交部照会中的指责，并希望向波兰政府表明，美国政府与‘布拉卡’号被截扣事件毫无关系。”六月二十三日美国海军在台湾以南公海的海面上拦劫苏联商船“图阿普斯”号的明目张胆行为，美国政府也说和它无关。但是，这是无耻的抵赖。大家知道，台湾蒋匪是美国海军部队所庇护和支持的、听命于它的美国主子的，蒋匪残余武装的武器、军舰、飞机、弹药无一不是由美国装备和供给并受着五角大楼的指挥的。所有拦劫商船的海盗行为，也都是在美国第七舰队控制的海面、在美国海空军的直接参加和协助之下进行的。据合众社一九五三年三月十三日发自新加坡的电讯报道：“挪威货船‘苔立法’号的一个高级职员说，美国飞机仍继续在‘钉梢’经过台湾海峡的外国船只。……美国飞机整日整夜地监视着该船。他说：‘日里，它们在我们上空盘旋飞行，显然想查明我们的身份。有一夜，一架飞机用强烈的灯光照我们的船，看清了船上的旗子后就飞去了。”十分明显，美国好战集团就是这种海盗行为的真正罪犯。
      同时，人们不能不注意到，美国参议院常设调查小组委员会主席、臭名远扬的恶棍麦卡锡曾数度叫嚷要“调查”和阻止西欧各国与我国进行贸易的船只。美国众议院军事委员会委员范展特也声称要
  “阻止”英国、巴拿马、波兰和挪威的船只进入
  “如上海、澳门、汕头等港口”。因此，美国当局对于这种海盗行为，是绝对逃不脱它所应该承担的责任的。
    美国好战集团占领台湾并指使蒋匪加紧海盗活动，不仅损害了许多国家的航运和贸易的利益，而且威胁亚洲和世界的和平。已故美国总统罗斯福曾在一九四一年日本偷袭珍珠港事件发生后向美国人民发表谈话指出：“在盗匪方法流行的地方，任何国家、任何人的安全都没有保证。”今天这些话已成为对指使蒋匪拦劫商船破坏航海自由的美国政府的有力控告了。
    中国人民和全世界人民以及一切愿根据自己的国家利益行事的国家，都是不能容忍美蒋匪帮的这种海盗行为，而必须给美蒋海盗匪徒以严厉打击的。
