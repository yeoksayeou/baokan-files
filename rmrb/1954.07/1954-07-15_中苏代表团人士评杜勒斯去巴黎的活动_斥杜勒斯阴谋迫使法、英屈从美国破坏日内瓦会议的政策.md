Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, July 13th: Our special correspondent reports: As the foreign ministers of various countries return to Geneva, and as the opinions of the relevant parties become closer and closer, and it becomes possible to reach an agreement on restoring peace in Indochina, the Geneva Conference has entered a decisive and important stage. It is very strange that Dulles did not return to Geneva like other foreign ministers to participate in the consultations between foreign ministers, but deliberately avoided the Geneva Conference and held separate talks with the foreign ministers of Britain and France in Paris on July 13.

Authoritative sources here believe that the U.S. government apparently held separate talks in Paris because it did not dare to openly reveal its ulterior plans to sabotage the restoration of peace in Indochina within the Geneva Conference, in order to take the opportunity to exert pressure on France and Britain and obstruct the Geneva Conference from reaching an agreement. The U.S. side has always opposed a fair and reasonable ceasefire in Indochina, calling agreeing to such a ceasefire a "surrender." Dulles went to Paris instead of Geneva in order to make it easier to force the foreign ministers of France and Britain to succumb to the U.S. policy of sabotaging the Geneva Conference.

The reporter learned that people from the Chinese delegation believe that Dulles' activities in Paris should arouse serious vigilance among all those who hope to quickly stop the hostilities in Indochina. Dulles' deliberate avoidance of the Geneva Conference and holding separate talks in Paris is not only a rare and strange action in international conferences, but also a manifestation of the United States' consistent policy of undermining the Geneva Conference. People from the Chinese delegation believe that the Geneva Conference has no reason to cater to the U.S. policy and not strive to reach an agreement that is acceptable and satisfactory to all parties concerned, and that is honorable to both sides of the war.

TASS News Agency, Geneva, July 13th: It is reported that French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Mendès France and British Foreign Secretary Eden, who have arrived in Geneva to continue the conference on restoring peace in Indochina, left for Paris on July 13 to meet with U.S. Secretary of State Dulles.

According to available information, the talks will discuss issues being discussed at the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference.

Dulles left Geneva before the Indochina issue began to be discussed, and now that other foreign ministers have returned to Geneva to continue the meeting, his unwillingness to return to Geneva cannot but attract everyone's attention.

Some people here pointed out that Dulles' visit to Paris is precisely at a time when the positions of the participants in the Geneva Conference have obviously become closer and there is a possibility of achieving constructive results.

Soviet delegation members noted that public opinion may get the impression that Dulles' actions indicate that he is attempting to obstruct the reaching of an agreement on restoring peace in Indochina and is exerting corresponding pressure on Britain and France for this purpose.

Dulles' separate talks with some participants in the Geneva Conference also show that the U.S. ruling group wants to avoid publicly discussing the U.S. delegation's position on the Indochina issue at the Geneva Conference. This once again proves that U.S. diplomats prefer to use pressure and command rather than reaching a mutually acceptable agreement through consultation with all participants in the conference. Some people also pointed out that Dulles' fear of publicly stating the U.S. position is primarily due to the fact that the possibility of reaching an agreement on restoring peace in Indochina and easing international tensions is obviously in conflict with the policies of the U.S. aggressive bloc.

Soviet delegation members believe that the U.S. diplomatic attempts cannot prevent the Geneva Conference from achieving constructive results.

### 中苏代表团人士评杜勒斯去巴黎的活动  斥杜勒斯阴谋迫使法、英屈从美国破坏日内瓦会议的政策

    中苏代表团人士评杜勒斯去巴黎的活动
    斥杜勒斯阴谋迫使法、英屈从美国破坏日内瓦会议的政策
    【新华社日内瓦十三日电】本社特派记者报道：在各国外长返回日内瓦及有关各方意见更趋接近并有可能达成恢复印度支那和平的协议的情况下，日内瓦会议已进入了决定性的重要阶段。人们十分奇怪杜勒斯没有像其他外长们一样回到日内瓦来参加外长间的协商，而却有意地避开日内瓦会议，在七月十三日到巴黎和英、法两国外长举行单独会谈。
    此间权威人士认为：美国政府显然由于不敢在日内瓦会议内公开其破坏恢复印度支那和平的不可告人的计划，才举行了巴黎的单独会谈，以便借机对法、英两国施加压力，阻挠日内瓦会议达成协议。美国方面一直反对在印度支那实现公正、合理的停战，它把同意这样的停战称为“投降”。杜勒斯到巴黎而不到日内瓦，为的是便于迫使法、英两国外长屈从美国破坏日内瓦会议的政策。
    记者获悉，中国代表团人士认为，杜勒斯在巴黎的活动，应该引起所有希望迅速停止在印度支那的敌对行动的人们的严重警惕。杜勒斯有意避开日内瓦会议而在巴黎举行单独会谈，不但是国际会议上所罕见的奇异的行动，而且是美国一贯破坏日内瓦会议的政策的表现。中国代表团人士相信，日内瓦会议没有任何理由去迎合美国的政策，而不去努力达成有关方面都可以接受和满意的、对交战双方都是光荣的协议。
    【新华社十四日讯】塔斯社日内瓦十三日讯：据悉，已到达日内瓦来继续进行关于恢复印度支那和平问题的会议的法国总理兼外交部长孟戴斯—弗朗斯和英国外交大臣艾登，在七月十三日动身到巴黎去会晤美国国务卿杜勒斯。
    根据现有的消息，这次会谈将讨论正在日内瓦外长会议上讨论的问题。
    杜勒斯是在印度支那问题还没有开始讨论之前离开日内瓦的，现在当其他外长们已经回到日内瓦来继续举行会议的时候，他不愿回到日内瓦来，这不能不引起大家的注意。
    这里有人指出：杜勒斯前往巴黎，正是在日内瓦会议的参加者的立场显然已趋接近、已有了可能取得建设性的结果的时候。
    苏联代表团人士注意到，舆论可能得到这样的印象：杜勒斯的这种行径，表明他企图阻挠在恢复印度支那和平问题上达成协议，并为了这个目的向英法两国施以相应的压力。
    杜勒斯和某些日内瓦会议的参加者举行单独会谈一事同时也说明，美国统治集团想规避在日内瓦会议上公开讨论美国代表团在印度支那问题上的立场。这再一次证明：美国外交官喜欢用施加压力和发号施令的办法，而不喜欢通过和所有参加会议的人协商来达成大家都能接受的协议。也有人指出：杜勒斯之所以害怕向公众公开表明美国的立场，首先是由于在恢复印度支那和平和缓和国际紧张局势问题上达成协议的可能性的出现，显然是和美国侵略集团的政策有矛盾的。
    苏联代表团人士相信，美国外交方面的企图是阻挠不了日内瓦会议取得建设性结果的。
