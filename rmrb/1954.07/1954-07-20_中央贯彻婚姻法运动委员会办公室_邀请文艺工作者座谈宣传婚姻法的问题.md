    At the meeting, Cao Mengjun, Deputy Secretary-General of the Central Marriage Law Implementation Movement Committee, introduced the current situation regarding the implementation of the Marriage Law and the several types of marriages and families that currently exist. She particularly pointed out that marriages and families organized according to socialist ideological principles are gradually increasing. She spoke about the educational role of many excellent works in promoting the Marriage Law among the masses. She emphasized that propaganda related to marriage and family is an important aspect of conducting socialist education among the people. She also put forward requirements and hopes for how the literary and art circles can strengthen the propaganda of the Marriage Law in the future. Subsequently, literary and art workers Ma Yanxiang, Zhao Shuli, and seven others spoke at the meeting. Using many vivid examples related to marriage and family, they explained how to carry out propaganda in this area in the future. They expressed that in future creations related to marriage and family, they would implement socialist ideology to achieve the goal of conducting socialist education among the people.

    Liu Zhiming pointed out in his speech that marriage and family are important themes in literary and artistic creation. He made a detailed analysis of the close relationship between marriage, family, society, labor, and production. He said that literary and art workers should vigorously reflect and praise happy and harmonious marriages and families with socialist morality and customs in their creations, and oppose and criticize feudal and capitalist-influenced marriages and families.

    Finally, Xie Juezai raised the question of how to publicize and implement the Marriage Law in the future: The issues of marriage and family have been clearly stipulated in the draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China. After the official promulgation of the Constitution, it is hoped that literary and art workers can create works that conduct new marriage and family education for the people, based on the spirit of the Constitution and the Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China.
