    More than 10,000 Graduates from Ordinary Middle School High Schools and Workers' and Peasants' Rapid Course Middle Schools in the Northeast Actively Prepare for College Entrance Exams
    More than 9,600 graduates from ordinary middle school high schools and more than 1,100 graduates from workers' and peasants' rapid course middle schools in the Northeast region have graduated after passing their graduation exams. Now, these graduates are stepping up their review in preparation for the college entrance examinations.
    The number of graduates from ordinary middle school high schools and workers' and peasants' rapid course middle schools in the Northeast region has increased this year. The number of graduates from ordinary middle school high schools alone has increased by 68.1 percent compared with the number of graduates in the summer of last year. After several years of study, they have made great progress. Students from workers' and peasants' rapid course middle schools have improved from the level of higher primary school or junior primary school when they first enrolled to the level of high school graduation after three years of hard work. The results of this graduation exam are mostly scores of 4 or 5.
    In order to help graduating students apply to universities, the schools have established college guidance committees or college guidance offices. Teachers in each school also personally lead students in their reviews and help them prepare for college entrance examinations. Many schools have also invited heads of various departments of colleges and universities to introduce the professional situation to students, and have invited local cultural and educational authorities to make reports on choosing majors, which has further encouraged students' confidence in applying to universities and guided students to determine their choice of majors based on national construction needs and personal conditions. Du Qin and Zhang Zhongxin, students and members of the Communist Youth League of Shenyang No. 2 Middle School, have chosen mechanical manufacturing and geology departments according to national needs and personal conditions. Communist Youth League member Zhang Jinghuan decided to study agriculture based on the needs of the country and her consistently good grades in physics, biology and other courses.

    东北区普通中学高中和工农速成中学
    一万多名毕业生积极准备升学考试
    东北区有九千六百多名普通中学高中毕业生和一千一百多名工农速成中学毕业生，经过毕业考试已经毕业了。现在，这批毕业生正加紧进行复习，准备升入大学的考试。
    东北区今年普通中学高中和工农速成中学毕业人数都有增加，仅普通中学高中毕业生人数就比去年暑期毕业的人数增加了百分之六十八点一。他们经过几年来的学习，都有很大进步。工农速成中学的学生，经过三年努力学习，都由刚入学时的高小或初小程度提高到高中毕业水平，这次毕业考试成绩大都是四、五分。
    为了帮助毕业学生投考大学，各校都成立了升学指导委员会或升学指导办公室。各校教师也都亲自领导学生进行复习，帮助学生准备升学考试。许多学校还邀请大专学校各系负责人员为学生们作专业情况介绍，邀请当地文教机关负责人员作关于选择科系志愿的报告，进一步鼓舞了学生们投考大学的信心，引导学生们根据国家建设需要和个人条件确定了选择科系的志愿。沈阳市第二中学学生、青年团员杜钦和张忠信等人按照国家需要和个人条件，选择了机械制造系和地质系。青年团员张晶还，根据国家需要和个人物理、生物等课程成绩一向较好，决定学农。（新华社）
