Xinhua News Agency, July 3rd: This summer, over 40,300 students will graduate from universities and colleges nationwide and join the cause of socialist construction in the motherland. Currently, the graduates have completed or are in the process of completing their graduation internships, graduation exams, graduation theses, and graduation design defenses. Starting in July, they will successively take up their work posts. Some geology students have already joined the geological survey work organized by the Ministry of Geology of the Central People's Government. After completing the survey work, these graduates will successively go to their assigned work posts.

This year's graduates include more than 14,600 engineering students and more than 400 students from ethnic minorities (excluding graduates from ethnic minority institutes). The students who were transferred from their jobs to study in specialized courses in universities and colleges in the summer of 1952 will mostly graduate this summer.

This year's university graduates, especially those from specialized courses, have studied according to the new teaching plans and have acquired a certain amount of basic theoretical knowledge and considerable professional knowledge. Most of them have undergone production internships, and some students have also completed course designs, graduation theses, and graduation designs. Therefore, the graduates' political awareness, theoretical level, and professional competence have improved compared to previous years. Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members among the graduates account for 46.4% of the total number of graduates.

Due to the rapid development of national construction, although the number of graduates this summer is larger than in previous years, it still falls far short of the needs of national construction. This is most evident in the allocation of graduates in major engineering disciplines such as mechanical engineering, civil engineering and architecture, and geology.

In order to do a good job in the unified allocation of university graduates this year, the Ministry of Personnel of the Central People's Government convened a meeting of personnel departments from major regions and some provinces and cities in June. According to the "Unified Allocation Plan for University Graduates Nationwide in the Summer of 1954," the deployment and dispatch of graduates were discussed and arranged. Meetings were also convened with various central government departments to arrange the work of receiving graduates.

In accordance with the requirements of the general task of the state during the transition period and the basic tasks of the first Five-Year Plan, the People's Government will continue to adopt the policy of "centralized use and key allocation" for the unified allocation of graduates this summer. For various industrial departments, priority is given to the needs of the 141 key projects and projects related to the 141 key projects that are under large-scale construction or are about to be under large-scale construction and that need to start production now or need to prepare for production. Allocations are made based on the work tasks of various industrial departments and the quota of technical personnel required to complete certain work in different industrial sectors, as well as the rate of growth in next year's work tasks compared to this year. Appropriate allocations have also been made for university teaching assistants, graduate students, and research interns at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. For graduates in agriculture, forestry, teacher training, law, and arts, the principle of "local allocation and central adjustment" is followed. They are mainly allocated to various regions, and appropriate adjustments are made for graduates in certain departments where supply and demand vary greatly between regions. Some graduates are transferred to meet the needs of university teaching assistants, graduate students, research interns at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and teachers at secondary vocational schools supervised by central government departments. The allocation of graduates from ethnic minorities is mainly based on their major and appropriately takes into account the needs of ethnic minority areas.

When allocating graduates, the People's Government paid attention to implementing the principle of "matching learning with application" on the basis of national needs. The work assigned to the graduates by the state is basically in line with their professional expertise. However, at present, there is still an inevitable distance between the professional settings and teaching content of our universities and colleges and the needs of national construction, and there is still an imbalance in the supply and demand relationship between the number of graduates in various departments and the needs of national construction. The professional knowledge of some graduates does not fully meet the requirements of current work, and a small number of graduates can only be assigned to work that is similar to the nature of their department and major. This requires graduates to obey the unified allocation of the state and ensure the supply of cadres for the cause of national construction. For example, there is a serious shortage of engineering and technical personnel in mechanical engineering, civil engineering and architecture, etc., which are urgently needed for national construction, and it is necessary to assign graduates from certain similar departments to undertake these tasks. On the other hand, there are more graduates in some departments than are actually needed, and their work must be arranged according to the needs of the work and the specific circumstances of the students.

This year's university graduates have greatly improved their political awareness after studying the general task of the state during the transition period. They are now full of patriotism and are actively preparing to accept the unified allocation of the state and welcome the glorious task of participating in national construction.

    全国高等学校在今年暑期中
    将有四万多毕业生参加祖国建设
    【新华社三日讯】今年暑期，全国高等学校将有四万零三百多名学生毕业，参加祖国社会主义建设事业。现在，毕业生们已完成或正在进行毕业实习、毕业考试、毕业论文和毕业设计答辩，从七月开始，他们将陆续走上工作岗位。部分地质系科毕业生，现已参加中央人民政府地质部组织的地质普查工作，这批毕业生，将在完成普查工作后陆续到所分配的工作岗位。
    今年毕业生中有工科学生一万四千六百多人，少数民族学生四百多人（各民族学院的毕业生不包括在内），一九五二年暑期抽调在职干部进入高等学校专修科学习的学生，今年暑期大部分都毕业了。
    今年暑假高等学校毕业生，特别是专修科毕业生，都曾按照新的教学计划学习，获得了一定的基础理论知识和相当的专业知识。他们大部分都经过生产实习，部分学生还作了课程设计、毕业论文和毕业设计。因此，毕业生的政治觉悟、理论水平和业务能力都较往年毕业生有所提高，毕业生中的共产党员和青年团员达毕业生人数的百分之四十六点四。
    由于国家建设事业的迅速发展，今年暑假毕业生人数虽较历届为多，但仍远赶不上国家建设的需要，其中在对工科的机械、土木建筑、地质等主要系科毕业生的分配上，表现得最为突出。
    为了做好今年高等学校毕业生的统一分配工作，中央人民政府人事部已在六月间召开了各大区和部分省、市人事部门的会议，根据“一九五四年暑假全国高等学校毕业生统一分配方案”讨论和布置了毕业生的调配和派遣等项工作；并召集了中央各业务部门开会，布置了接收毕业生的工作。
    根据国家过渡时期总任务及第一个五年计划的基本任务的要求，人民政府对今年暑假毕业生仍采取“集中使用、重点配备”的统一分配的方针。对于各工业部门，首先考虑一百四十一项工程以及和一百四十一项有关的工程中，已大规模施工或即将大规模施工、现须开始生产或即须准备生产的项目的需要，并根据各工业部门的工作任务及不同产业部门完成一定工作所需技术人员的定额以及明年工作任务较今年增长的速度等条件进行分配。对于高等学校助教、研究生及中国科学院研究实习员，也作了适当配备。对于农林、师范、政法、艺术四类毕业生，按照“地方分配、中央调剂”的原则，主要分配给各地区，对地区间某些供求悬殊的系科毕业生作了适当调剂，并抽调部分毕业生解决高等学校助教、研究生、中国科学院研究实习员和中央业务部门主管的中等专业学校教员的需要。少数民族毕业生的分配，主要是根据他们所学的专业，适当照顾少数民族地区的需要。
    在分配毕业生的工作时，人民政府注意了在国家需要的基础上贯彻“学用一致”的原则；毕业生们接受国家所分配的工作，基本上是符合于他们所学专业特长的。但目前我国高等学校的专业设置及教学内容和国家建设需要之间不可避免地还存在着一定的距离，高等学校各系科毕业生的人数和国家建设需要之间的供求关系还存在着不均衡现象。部分毕业生所学的专业知识还不完全符合目前工作的要求，少数毕业生还只能分配作和所学系科、专业性质相近的工作。这就要求毕业生们服从国家需要接受统一分配，保证国家建设事业干部的供应。例如目前国家建设迫切需要的机械、土木建筑等工程技术人材，就有严重的供不应求的现象，必须分配某些性质相近的系科毕业生去担负这些工作。另一方面，有些系科毕业生却超过实际需要，必须根据工作需要和学生具体情况来安排他们的工作。
    今年高等学校的毕业生们，在学习国家过渡时期总任务以后，政治觉悟大大提高，现正满怀爱国主义热情，积极准备接受国家的统一分配，迎接参加祖国建设的光荣任务。
