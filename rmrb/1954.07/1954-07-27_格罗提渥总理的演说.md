Prime Minister Grotewohl's Speech

Respected Comrade Premier, dear Chinese comrades, dear friends, comrades:

I believe you will agree if I express my gratitude for the friendly speech of Comrade Zhou Enlai, Premier of the People's Republic of China, and express our sincere joy at his visit to the German Democratic Republic. The people of the German Democratic Republic, and all German peace-loving forces with them, are deeply moved by the success of the Geneva Conference negotiations. This negotiation has led to a ceasefire in Indochina and ended a criminal war against the people. These people fought to defend their most sacred things—their life, freedom, national survival, and independence. The shameful slaughter of hundreds of thousands of people has now come to an end. Among them were also 40,000 German mercenaries in the Foreign Legion, who, with Adenauer's consent and tolerance, were forced to pay with their lives for the colonialist bandits' dirty war in Vietnam. The conclusion of the Vietnam armistice has greatly eased the international situation and filled the peace-loving people of all countries with new hope for lasting peace.

The Indochina ceasefire is the result of the unremitting efforts of the Soviet Union, China, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to seek understanding.

Thanks to the Geneva Accords, the national liberation struggle and noble heroism of the people of Indochina have been internationally recognized.

You, Comrade Premier Zhou Enlai, expressed the peace aspirations of the people of all countries in Geneva, because you proposed to the major powers a plan for a peaceful resolution of Asian issues, the restoration and consolidation of peace in Asia. Together with the Soviet Union and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, you have achieved the implementation of a peace plan that demonstrates the strength and power of the great world peace camp.

Stopping American aggression, respecting the independence and sovereignty of the people of Asian countries, respecting their national rights and freedoms, eliminating all foreign military bases in Asia, withdrawing foreign troops, abolishing measures to re-militarize Japan, and normalizing economic relations are all your demands. These demands have been fully endorsed by all peace-loving people, especially the German people. Like the people of Korea and Vietnam, the German people have waged an arduous struggle for the right to national survival, and have also been threatened by American imperialists to their national survival.

Comrade Premier, your visit to India and Burma demonstrates the will of the People's Republic of China to promote peaceful cooperation on the basis of mutual respect for independence and non-aggression.

All these achievements represent the strength and power of the great peace camp led by the Soviet Union. It also shows that the People's Republic of China has become such a great power that no one can solve international problems of world significance today without it. No one can any longer hinder or obstruct the legitimate national demands of the Chinese people to participate equally in the international arena. The Geneva Conference has formed a turning point in international politics.

The imperialist aggressive forces who wanted to turn South Vietnam into one of the bases of the planned new Southeast Asian aggression group have suffered an obvious defeat. The American imperialists' "policy of strength" has also gone bankrupt in Asia. Tensions eased after Dulles left the Geneva Conference. The spirit of consultation between diplomatic representatives has gradually progressed until the victory of peace.

If the Americans took a similar position on the German issue, wouldn't things be the same? Indeed, we Germans do not want to interfere in American affairs, we want to make this sentence effective: that American affairs are managed by Americans, but we believe that German affairs should also be managed by Germans.

We are pleased to confirm that thanks to the positive attitude of the French government, the Geneva Conference was successfully achieved in a manner consistent with France's national interests and taking into account the interests of the people of Indochina. This fact once again proves that the idea of peaceful coexistence of countries with different social systems will surely triumph.

We fully agree with the statement of the Soviet government: "The Soviet government believes that the agreements reached in Geneva on the ceasefire and restoration of peace in Indochina promote the easing of international tensions and also create favorable conditions for resolving other important international issues that are not only related to Asia but also to Europe, first of all such issues as: stopping the arms race, banning atomic weapons, ensuring collective security in Europe, and resolving the German issue in a peaceful and democratic direction."

The great achievements made by the People's Republic of China in building a people's democratic system and economic construction are also reflected in the great international achievements. These achievements are due to the various democratic reforms that were won in the Chinese people's years of arduous struggle against domestic feudal oppressors and foreign imperialists. Under the leadership of Mao Zedong and the ever-victorious Communist Party, the Chinese people are consolidating and developing their people's democratic system, realizing their great goal of transforming yesterday's backward agricultural country into a modern socialist industrial country. The achievements of the first year of China's Five-Year Plan show how great the creative labor of the free Chinese people is. This upsurge is also reflected in the greatly increased total output, especially the increase in the production of steel, iron, electricity, and the most important daily necessities.

The revolutionary changes that have taken place in China and Germany since World War II are the strong foundation of the unbreakable friendship between the German and Chinese people. The friendship between our two peoples occupies a special place in the relations between peace-loving people of all countries. As Comrade Mao Zedong emphasized in his telegram congratulating the founding of the German Democratic Republic:

"The people's Germany and the people's China are both on the front line of the great struggle against imperialism."

We hope that the heroic Chinese people will achieve new great victories in the future struggle, and please, dear Comrade Zhou Enlai, convey our brotherly respect to all the Chinese people.

Like the working people of China, the working people of the German Democratic Republic are also working hard and enthusiastically to build a new democratic social system and are working every day for peace.

Like the working class of China, the working class of the German Democratic Republic, united with the urban and rural laborers, has established a new democratic state system, a system without capitalist exploitation, without monopoly capitalists and militarists.

Today, the German Democratic Republic has become a fortress of all patriotic forces in Germany in the national struggle, and the base point of our people's national will. At the same time, People's China is also a powerful center of attention and a brilliant example in the national liberation struggle of the people of Asian countries. Today, our two peoples and the socialist Soviet Union—the leader of the international movement for peace, democracy, and socialism—are closely united. This great commonality between our two peoples also plays an influence in the multifaceted economic and cultural relations between the People's Republic of China and the German Democratic Republic. This relationship is constantly deepening the sincere friendship between our two countries.

The relationship between our two countries also profoundly affects West Germany. For many businessmen and entrepreneurs in West Germany, unrestricted trade with China would be a very profitable deal. The impact of the American economic crisis on West Germany will be alleviated. The wages and bread of countless West German workers will be guaranteed.

The German Democratic Republic is grateful for this cooperation in all aspects, and will do everything possible to implement the economic, political, and cultural agreements concluded with the Chinese people in a spirit of sincere friendship. At the same time, the German Democratic Republic will also make special use of its friendly relations with the world's greatest Chinese people to promote the economic prosperity of all Germany and to eliminate unemployment among West German workers.

The political tension caused by the American imperialists, its impact is particularly obvious in Germany, due to the "European Defense Community" treaty and promoted the revival of German militarism in West Germany, especially threatening Germany's neighbors and the German people to form a fatal crisis. It is this militarist and fascist force, which brought infinite suffering to the people of European countries in the Second World War and drove Germany into the greatest national disaster, that today has taken the lead in the Bonn state apparatus. Bonn's politicians, ministers, SS generals, and war criminals released from prison shamelessly declare that they will use the help of the new fascist military organization to realize their revenge plans. The "European Defense Community" treaty and the related general treaty are serious obstacles to German reunification. Because these two treaties are selling out West Germany's right to self-determination and independence.

Adenauer shouted that sovereignty is just a false deception for the people of West Germany. Germany must not obtain sovereignty through the war-mongering "European Defense Community" treaty. It can only achieve sovereignty through a peace treaty.

But the prerequisite for concluding a peace treaty is understanding between the people of East and West Germany. We have done everything possible to achieve this understanding. Adenauer is doing everything possible to obstruct this understanding. The Adenauer government has become an active defender of American billionaires who survive by armaments and war. West Germany has become an American protectorate. The national property of the German people is being arbitrarily squandered and sold. West Germany today has become a training ground for foreign militarists and war criminals. They turn German land into military exercise grounds, place atomic artillery, and build air bases.

All this, as well as the fact that most of West German industry is controlled by foreign capitalists, makes the Bonn reactionaries today replay the old tune of the Hitler rulers, threatening and oppressing other nations, and constantly slandering and defaming the socialist Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic. But the Adenauer regime is shaky. More than twelve million people in the German Democratic Republic have expressed their support for a peace treaty and are firmly opposed to Adenauer. In North Rhine-Westphalia, Adenauer lost more than one million votes. Within the Adenauer group, the mood of unease is growing day by day. The German bourgeoisie is increasingly aware of where Adenauer's adventurous tricks will lead. Opposition within Adenauer himself is also growing stronger. The Adenauer regime is shaky, and more and more of his former supporters are abandoning him.

The corruption and collapse of the Adenauer regime is manifested in the fact that Dr. John, director of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution of West Germany, fled to the German Democratic Republic. John, who truly understood the dark secrets within Adenauer, stated yesterday on our radio station that Germany would be in danger if it adopted Adenauer's policies and would be divided forever.

But things will not be like this, because now there is a German people and a German Democratic Republic. Only when the final dividing line is removed and all Germans in both East and West extend their hands to each other like brothers, will the struggle of the German Democratic Republic for unity and peace come to an end.

Many countries with different social systems have reached mutual understanding at the Geneva Conference and have acted in the spirit of maintaining peace. This conference also points out to the German people that understanding can be reached between the German people. It is possible to solve the German problem on an international basis. The German people must act themselves, the German people must make their own decisions, and at the same time bravely embark on a new path, namely the path of peace and democracy.

The Adenauer regime and the Bonn-Paris treaties, which are the main obstacles to Germany's peaceful reunification, must be abolished. Only in this way can Germany be finally unified and a new future be built in a peaceful environment.

In view of this development, if Comrade Ollenhauer of the Social Democratic Party ignores the letter I wrote to him regarding the necessary cooperation of the German working class in the struggle for unity and peace, then we are well aware of it. But if Comrade Ollenhauer and the various departments of the Social Democratic Party leadership around him think that this matter is over, then they are completely wrong.

Comrade Ollenhauer, who at the Social Democratic Party Congress in Berlin showed that he was closer to Adenauer than to the workers of the German Democratic Republic, will soon see that the workers of West Germany and the workers of the German Democratic Republic will extend a friendly hand to each other like brothers regardless of everything—even without him.

We need a Germany where the people are masters of their own affairs, we need a Germany without unemployment, with a high standard of living and trade with all countries in the world. The Germany we need is democratic, free, and strong, because it is a peace-loving, independent country, and it maintains close friendship with the people of all countries in the world.

In this struggle, the German people have a strong ally. The Soviet Union has always been constantly working towards a peaceful solution to the German problem and has given the German people enormous material assistance.

Dear Comrade Premier Zhou Enlai, your friendly visit proves that the 600 million Chinese people are standing with us, standing on the side of the people's democratic countries and all peace-loving people.

This powerful peace camp is invincible, and the future belongs to it.

Long live the friendship between the German and Chinese people!

Long live Comrade Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, and Comrade Wilhelm Pieck, President of the German Democratic Republic!

Long live our common friendship with the great socialist Soviet Union!

Long live Comrade Zhou Enlai, Premier of the People's Republic of China!

### 格罗提渥总理的演说

专栏：

    格罗提渥总理的演说尊敬的总理同志，亲爱的中国同志们，亲爱的朋友们，同志们：
    我相信如果我对中华人民共和国总理周恩来同志的友好的讲话表示感谢并对他在德意志民主共和国的访问表示我们真诚喜悦的话，是会得到你们同意的。德意志民主共和国人民以及和他们在一起的所有德国爱好和平的力量深为日内瓦会议谈判成功所感动。这个谈判已导向印度支那的停战并结束了一个反人民的罪恶战争。这些人民曾为保卫他们最神圣的东西——他们的生命自由、民族生存和独立而战。成千上万人民被可耻地屠杀的事情现在已告终止。其中也有着四万个在外籍军团中的德国雇佣兵，在阿登纳的同意及容忍下为着殖民主义强盗们在越南的肮脏战争，他们被迫付出了生命。越南停战协定的缔结使得国际局势大为缓和，并使各国爱好和平人民对持久和平充满了新的希望。
    印度支那停战是苏联、中国和越南民主共和国为谋求谅解坚持不懈努力的结果。
    由于日内瓦协定，印度支那各国人民的民族解放斗争和崇高的英勇行为已得到国际上的承认。
    您周恩来总理同志在日内瓦表达了各国人民的和平愿望，因为您曾向各大国提出了一个和平解决亚洲问题、恢复和巩固亚洲和平的计划。您和苏联、越南民主共和国一起使一个显出伟大世界和平阵营的强大和有力量的和平计划获得了实现。
    制止美国的侵略行为、尊重亚洲各国人民的独立和主权、尊重他们的民族权利和自由、肃清一切在亚洲的外国军事基地、撤退外国军队、废除日本重新军国主义化的措施和使经济关系正常化，这些都是你们的要求。这些要求已获得了一切爱好和平的人民，特别是德国人民的完全赞同。德国人民像朝鲜、越南人民一样为了民族的生存权利进行了艰苦的斗争，并同样遭到了美帝国主义者对他们民族生存的威胁。
    总理同志，通过您到印度和缅甸的访问，证明了中华人民共和国在各国人民互相尊重独立和互不侵犯的基础之上促进和平合作的意志。
    所有这些成就都表示着以苏联为首的伟大的和平阵营的强大和力量。它同时说明中华人民共和国已经成为这样一个大国，没有它，今天就没有人能够解决具有世界意义的国际问题。没有人再能够妨碍和阻挡中国人民平等参加国际舞台的正当的民族要求。日内瓦会议已形成国际政治中的一个转折点。
    那些想把越南南部变为计划中新的东南亚侵略集团基地之一的帝国主义侵略力量遭到了显然的失败。美帝国主义者的“实力政策”也在亚洲破产了。在杜勒斯离开日内瓦会议以后紧张局势即获得了缓和。各外交代表间的协商精神已逐步进展，直到和平的胜利。
    如果美国人在德国问题上采取类似的立场，那么事情不也会同样吗？诚然，我们德国人不想干涉美国事务，我们愿使这句话生效：即美国的事情由美国人管，但是我们认为德国的事情也应该由德国人来管。
    我们高兴地确认：由于法国政府的积极态度，在符合法国的民族利益并在顾及到印度支那各国人民利益的情况下而使日内瓦会议顺利获得成果。这一事实再度证明不同社会制度的国家的和平共处的思想一定会胜利。
    我们完全同意苏联政府的声明：“苏联政府认为，在日内瓦达成的关于在印度支那停火和恢复和平的各项协定促进了国际紧张局势的缓和，同时也为解决其他不仅同亚洲有关、而且同欧洲有关的悬而未决的重要国际问题创造了有利条件，首先就是这样一些问题，如：停止军备竞赛，禁止原子武器，保障欧洲的集体安全，按照和平、民主的方针解决德国问题。”
    中华人民共和国在建设人民民主制度及经济建设中取得了的伟大成就，也反映在伟大的国际成就中。这些成就的取得应归功于各项民主改革，这些改革是在中国人民反对本国封建压迫者和外国帝国主义者的长年艰苦斗争中赢得的。中国人民在毛泽东和百战百胜的共产党的领导下巩固并发展着他们的人民民主制度，实现他们伟大的目标，把昨天还是一个落后的农业国变成为一个现代化的社会主义的工业国。中国五年计划第一年度的成绩表明自由的中国人民的创造性劳动是多么伟大。这种高涨也表现在总产量中生产大大地提高，特别是钢、铁、电力和最主要生活日用品生产量的增加。
    第二次世界大战以后在中国和德国所发生的革命变化是德国人民和中国人民牢不可破的友谊的坚强基础。我们两国人民的友谊在爱好和平的各国人民的关系上占有特殊的地位。正如毛泽东同志在祝贺德意志民主共和国成立的电文中强调指出的：
  “人民的德国和人民的中国同处在反对帝国主义的伟大斗争的最前线。”
    我们希望英勇的中国人民在今后的斗争中获得新的伟大胜利，并请您亲爱的周恩来同志，向全中国人民转达我们兄弟般的敬意。
    像中国的劳动人民一样，德意志民主共和国的
  劳动人民也正在努力地和热情地建设一个新的民主
  的社会制度，并且为了和平而每天进行着劳动。
    像中国的工人阶级一样，德意志民主共和国工
  人阶级联合城乡劳动者已建立了一个新的民主的国家制度，一个没有资本主义剥削、没有垄断资本家
  和军国主义者的制度。
    今天德意志民主共和国已成为德国一切爱国力
  量在民族斗争中的堡垒，我国人民民族意志的基点。同时，人民中国也是亚洲各国人民民族解放斗争中的强大的注意中心和光辉的榜样。今天我们两国人民和社会主义的苏联——争取和平民主和社会主义国际运动的领导者——已紧密团结在一起。我们两国人民以这一伟大的共同性，在中华人民共和国和德意志民主共和国间多方面的经济文化关系中也起着影响。这个关系正在不断地加深着我们两国间的真诚友谊。
    我们两国的关系也深刻地影响着西德。对西德许多商人和企业主来说，与中国无限制的贸易将是
  一笔非常有利的交易。美国经济危机对西德的影响将会减轻。无数西德劳动者的工资和面包将会获得保证。
    德意志民主共和国感谢这种各方面的合作，它将尽一切力量以真诚友好的精神来切实地执行和中国人民所缔结的经济、政治和文化的协定。同时，德意志民主共和国也将特别利用它与这世界上最伟大的中国人民的友好关系，使全德经济繁荣增长，以消除西德工人的失业。
    由于美帝国主义者所造成的政治紧张局势，其影响特别在德国已经明显了，由于“欧洲防务集团”条约而促使德国军国主义在西德的复活，特别是威胁着德国的邻邦并对于德国人民形成致命的危机。就是这个在第二次大战中曾经带给欧洲各国人民无限痛苦的并将德国驱入最大的民族灾难中的军国主义和法西斯主义力量，今天又在波恩国家机构中取得了领导地位。波恩的政客们、部长们、党卫队将军们以及从监狱被释放出来的战犯们，竟毫不掩饰地宣称将借新的法西斯军事机构的帮助来实现他们的复仇计划。“欧洲防务集团”条约及与此相关的一般性条约是德国重新统一的严重障碍。因为这两个条约是出卖西德的自决权和独立自主权的。
    阿登纳大声疾呼主权不过是对西德人民进行一种虚伪的欺骗而已。德国决不能通过煽动战争的
  “欧洲防务集团”条约而取得主权。它只有通过和约才能取得主权。
    但是缔结和约的先决条件是东西德人民之间的谅解。我们已经尽一切力量争取实现这种谅解。阿登纳却尽一切力量阻挠这种谅解。阿登纳政府已经成为借军备和战争生存的美国亿万富翁的积极维护者。西德已变成了美国的保护国。德国人民的民族财产遭到任意挥霍和出卖。西德今天成为外国军国主义者和战争罪犯的练兵场。他们把德国的土地变为军事演习场，安置原子炮和建立飞机基地。
    所有这一切以及西德工业大部掌握在外国资本家手中的事实，就使得波恩反动分子今天重又弹起希特勒统治者的旧调，威胁和压榨其他民族，并对社会主义苏联和德意志民主共和国不断进行诬蔑和诽谤。但是阿登纳政权是动摇的。一千二百万以上的德意志民主共和国人民，已表示拥护和平条约，并坚决反对阿登纳。在北莱因威斯迪伐伦州，阿登纳失去一百万以上的选票。在阿登纳集团内部，不安的情绪逐日增长着。德国资产阶级愈益认识，阿登纳的冒险伎俩将导向何处。在阿登纳自己的内部的反对，也愈来愈强烈了。阿登纳政权是动摇的，以前拥护他的人愈来愈多地抛弃他了。
      阿登纳政权的腐败和崩溃，表现在西德联邦宪法保卫局局长荣恩博士逃亡到德意志民主共和国来。荣恩真正了解到阿登纳内部的黑暗秘密，已于昨日在我们电台声明：德国如果采取阿登纳的政策将处于危险中，将永远分裂。
      但事情也不会是这样，因为现在有着德意志人民和一个德意志民主共和国。只有当最后的分界线撤销了，所有东西两部分的德国人都兄弟般地伸出手来以后，德意志民主共和国为统一、和平所进行的斗争才算结束。
      许多不同社会制度的国家，都在日内瓦会议上相互取得了谅解，以维护和平的精神进行了活动。这个会议也向德国人民指出：德国人民之间是能够取得谅解的。在国际的基础上来解决德国问题是可能的。德国人民必须自己行动起来，德国人民必须自己作出决定，同时勇敢地踏上新的道路即和平民主的道路。
    成为德国和平统一主要障碍的阿登纳政权和波恩巴黎条约，必须予以废除。由此才能最后统一德国，以及在和平的环境中建设一个新的将来。
    鉴于这种发展情况，如果社会民主党的奥伦豪尔同志对我所写给他的关于德国工人阶级为争取统
  一和平而进行必要合作的信置之不理，那么我们也就敬悉了。但如果奥伦豪尔同志及其周围的社会民主党领导机关各部门，都认为这件事就算完结，那么他们就完全错了。
    在柏林社会民主党代表大会上，表现得靠近阿登纳还比靠近德意志民主共和国工人更紧密一些的奥伦豪尔同志，不久将一定看到西德的工人和德意志民主共和国的工人，将不顾一切——即使没有他也将像兄弟般地伸出友谊的手来。
    我们需要一个由人民当家作主的德国，我们需要一个没有失业、享有高度生活水平并和世界一切国家进行贸易的德国。我们所需要的德国是民主的、自由的、强大的，因为它是爱好和平的、独立的国家，它和世界所有各国人民都保持着紧密的友谊。
    在这个斗争中，德国人民有着强大的盟国。苏联一直是不断地在致力于和平解决德国问题，同时曾给德国人民以巨大的物质援助。
    亲爱的周恩来总理同志，通过您的友好访问，证明了六万万的中国人民是和我们一起，共同站在人民民主国家和一切爱好和平人们的一边。
    这个强大的和平阵营是不可战胜的，将来是属于它的。
    德中人民友好万岁！
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府主席毛泽东同志和德意志民主共和国总统威廉·皮克同志万岁！
    我们对伟大的社会主义苏联的共同友谊万岁！
    中华人民共和国总理周恩来同志万岁！
                  （新华社柏林二十五日电）
