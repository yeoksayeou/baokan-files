The Huaihe River tributary diversion project below Wuhe County, Anhui, one of the largest earthwork projects in the Huaihe River harnessing effort, has been successfully completed in mid-June this year after more than three years and the efforts of over 600,000 laborers. From now on, the waters of the Hui River, Tuo River, and other tributaries can flow directly into Hongze Lake, and will no longer be flooded by backflow from the Huaihe River main stream, benefiting approximately 12.2 million mu of farmland directly or indirectly on the Huaibei Plain. In mid-May of this year, the Huaihe River basin experienced widespread heavy rainfall, exceeding the maximum pre-flood rainfall in previous years, but because the Tong River dam in Wuhe County was closed, the tributary water level was 1.59 meters lower than the Huaihe River main stream, and 200,000 mu of wheat nearby was not flooded, demonstrating the initial effectiveness of the project.

Before the start of this project, the Huaihe River main stream channel below Wuhe County in Anhui Province was winding and the water flow was slow. The Huaihe River water level near Wuhe County was very high. In addition, the convergence of the Hui, Chong, Tong, and Tuo Rivers at this point increased the flow of the Huaihe River main stream. Whenever the Huaihe River main stream rose, floods often flowed back into the inland rivers, causing a large low-lying area in the southeast of the Suxian Special Zone to be flooded. In the winter of 1951, the Huaihe River tributary diversion project officially began. First, the Chongtong River was dredged, and the arduous Fengshan Ridge Cutting and Xiacaowan Ridge Cutting projects were carried out, opening up a waterway for the inland rivers to flow directly into Hongze Lake. In the winter of 1952, the Bogang Diversion River, about 15 li long, 530 meters wide, and 6-7 meters deep, was excavated on flat ground as a new riverbed for the Huaihe River main stream to flow independently into Hongze Lake after the tributary diversion. Over the past three years, the laborers have overcome the difficulties caused by thin silt, quicksand, and sandy gravel in the severe winter and hot summer, completing 60 million cubic meters of earthwork and 60,000 cubic meters of stonework. In the course of construction, thousands of models of Huaihe River harnessing emerged.

    安徽五河县以下淮河干支流分流工程完工
    治淮中最大的土方工程之一——安徽五河县以下的淮河干支分流工程，经过三年多的时间，先后六十多万民工的努力，已于今年六月中旬胜利完工。从此，浍河、沱河等支流的河水，可直接流进洪泽湖，同时不再受淮河干流倒灌的影响而泛滥成灾，淮北平原上约有一千二百余万亩农田可直接或间接受益。今年五月中旬，淮河流域普降大雨，超过历年汛前最大暴雨量，但由于五河县潼河拦河坝堵闭，因此支流水位比淮河干流低一·五九公尺，附近二十万亩麦子没有受淹，初步显示了工程的效用。
    在这一工程开工之前，安徽省五河县以下的淮河干流河道弯曲，水流很慢，五河县附近的淮河水位很高；加上浍、漴、潼、沱等支流在此汇合，大量内水流进淮河，更增加了淮河干流的流量。每逢淮河干流涨水，洪水常常倒灌入内河，宿县专区东南部就有很大一片比较低洼的地区因此被淹。一九五一年冬天，淮河干支分流工程正式开工，首先疏浚了漴潼河，进行了艰巨的峰山切岭和下草湾切岭工程，开辟了内河直接流入洪泽湖的水道。一九五二年冬又在平地开挖一条长约十五里、宽五百三十公尺、深达六、七公尺的泊岗引河，作为干支分流后淮河干流单独流入洪泽湖的一段新河床。三年多来，民工们在冰天雪地的严冬和酷热的夏季里，战胜了稀淤、流沙、砂礓所带来的困难，完成了六千万立方公尺土方和六万立方公尺石方的任务。在施工过程中，并涌现了数以千计的治淮模范。
