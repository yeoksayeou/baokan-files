    New Fishing Vessels Set Sail for Fishing
    The Lüda Aquatic Products Company plans to build eight new 200-horsepower fishing vessels this year, and three have already been completed. On July 10th, the first newly built fishing vessel began fishing at sea, and the remaining two will also be put into production within days.
    The new fishing vessels are designed according to a new model. Based on production needs, they can operate as single vessels or as double vessels; they can use trawls or purse seines; and the raising and lowering of nets are mechanically operated. The hull is 26 meters long and 5.1 meters wide, which is narrower and longer than the old-fashioned fishing vessels, so the water contact area is small, and it can travel more than 8.5 nautical miles per hour. The cabin can hold 50 tons of fresh fish and can also store about 30 tons of crushed ice and fuel oil and other materials, so it can work at sea for half a month to twenty days without docking. In addition to radios, kitchens, and safety equipment, the ship is also equipped with a telegraph room. The crew's berths also have transparent and ventilation equipment. It is estimated that these three fishing vessels can catch 800 tons of fish in the second half of this year's slack season. When all eight new fishing vessels are put into production in the future, calculated by the yield of purse seines, they can produce more than 4,000 tons of fresh fish per year.

    新型渔轮出海捕鱼
    旅大水产公司今年计划新造八只二百马力的渔轮，现在有三只已经竣工。七月十日，第一只新造渔轮开始出海捕鱼，其余两只也将在日内投入生产。
    新造渔轮是按照新型设计的，依照生产上的需要，它可以实行单船作业，也可以实行双船作业；可以使用拖网，也可以使用围网；上网下网都是机械操作。船身长有二十六公尺，宽五点一公尺，比旧式渔轮狭长，因此触水面积小，一小时能行八浬半以上。船舱可以容纳五十吨鲜鱼，同时还能储存三十吨左右的碎冰和燃料油等其他物资，可以在海面上工作半月至二十天不需靠港。船上除了有收音机、厨房、安全设备外，并设有电报机房。在船员卧铺上还设有透明和通风设备。这三只渔轮估计在今年淡产的下半年可以捕鱼八百吨。将来八只新渔轮全部投入生产时，以围网的产量计算，一年能生产四千余吨鲜鱼。
