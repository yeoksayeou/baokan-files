    Tianjin, Xi'an, Nanjing, Chengdu and Other Municipal Districts
    Held District People's Congress Meetings
    Discussed the Draft Constitution and Elected Representatives to the Municipal People's Congress
    District People's Congress meetings were held in municipal districts of Tianjin, Xi'an, Nanjing, Chengdu and other cities from the end of June to the beginning of July. The meetings in each district focused on discussing the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China and elected representatives to the Municipal People's Congress.
    The districts of Tianjin held their first second or third People's Congress meetings from June 28 to July 1. The 1,325 people's representatives attending the meetings enthusiastically discussed the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China and passed resolutions supporting the draft constitution. Sun Weizhong, a labor model in Tianjin and workshop director of the state-owned Dagu Chemical Plant, said at the Tanggu District People's Congress meeting: "After discussing the Draft Constitution, I deeply feel the glory and importance of the working class's tasks. I will use practical actions to welcome the birth of our country's first truly democratic constitution." Guo Zengxiang, a people's representative from the third district and worker at the privately owned Hengda Drawn Silk Factory, said: "I will definitely carry out in-depth publicity of the Draft Constitution among the people and mobilize the masses to seriously discuss and supervise capitalists to accept the state's socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce." People's representatives from the streets also expressed their sincere support for the Draft Constitution. The resolutions passed at the district meetings unanimously guaranteed that they would use practical actions to support the Draft Constitution. The district People's Congress meetings also elected 457 representatives to the Municipal People's Congress by secret ballot (excluding the number of municipal people's representatives to be elected in the suburbs), including workers, farmers, heads of government agencies and local organizations of various democratic parties and people's organizations in Tianjin, university professors, primary and secondary school teachers, medical workers, engineers, literary and art workers, journalists, ethnic minorities, private industrialists and businessmen, and representatives from various strata such as religious circles. In addition, ten army representatives have also been elected by the Chinese People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Tianjin.
    The first third People's Congress meetings held successively in various districts of Xi'an from June 28 all ended on July 1. The people's representatives in each district seriously and earnestly discussed the Draft Constitution at the meeting with the attitude of being masters of the country. Liu Yulian, an old worker who participated in the "February 7th" Great Strike and director of the Fuel Plant of the Xi'an Locomotive Depot of the Zhengzhou Railway Administration, said at the Eighth District People's Congress meeting: Under the rule of imperialism and reactionaries, I suffered discrimination and persecution. At that time, they didn't take the working people seriously at all. Now, the Communist Party and Chairman Mao have given the working people various rights and guaranteed them with laws. In the future, I must work hard with all the workers to complete the transportation tasks assigned to us by the state and use practical actions to welcome the birth of the first constitution of our people. Ma Zhijun, the imam of the Sajinqiao Qingzhen West Temple and a people's representative from the Sixth District, said: I have lived for more than sixty years, and this is the first time I have seen a constitution that truly protects the interests of ethnic minorities. I not only fully support it, but after the constitution is officially promulgated, I will also work hard to fulfill my obligations as a citizen to implement and protect it. After heated discussions, the district meetings all passed resolutions to greet the promulgation of the Draft Constitution with practical actions such as increasing production, practicing economy, improving work, and strengthening learning. After careful and prudent deliberation and discussion, the district People's Congress meetings all solemnly elected representatives to the Xi'an Municipal People's Congress by secret ballot. As a result of the election, the representative candidates jointly nominated by the Xi'an Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, local organizations of various democratic parties, and people's organizations were elected with a very large number of votes. The 244 elected municipal people's representatives sincerely thanked the people for their entrustment and trust in them, and asked the people to supervise and help them regularly.
    Eleven districts and one directly subordinate town in Nanjing held their first first People's Congress meetings from June 26 to July 1. Before the meeting, the people's representatives were organized to conduct preliminary discussions on the Draft Constitution. Some representatives also solicited opinions from the voters' group leaders and the masses on the Draft Constitution. At the meeting, everyone explained the great significance of the Draft Constitution based on their own personal experiences and expressed their willingness to use practical actions to support the Draft Constitution. Zhao Dehai, a labor model of the Shanghai Railway Administration and a people's representative from the Sixth District, narrated the persecution suffered by workers of the Puzhen Factory of the Shanghai Railway Administration in June 1948 when they held a factory-wide strike to oppose the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang. He said: "The democracy and freedom fought for by the workers' bloody struggle in those years have been fixed in the Draft Constitution. We must use practical actions to preserve this victory." Wang Biying, a female worker at the privately owned Minsheng Cloth Factory and a people's representative from the Third District, said: According to the provisions of the Draft Constitution, we must supervise the illegal acts of capitalists so that they accept socialist transformation and strive for the early realization of a socialist society. Feng Duan, a lecturer in the Physics Department of Nanjing University and a people's representative from the Fifth District, used examples such as the twelvefold increase in experimental instruments at Nanjing University after liberation to illustrate the state's emphasis on cultural and educational undertakings. He expressed excitement about the provisions in the Draft Constitution that the state establishes and gradually expands various schools. After discussion, the district meetings all made resolutions to support the Draft Constitution. At the meeting, the people's representatives in each district also reviewed the work of the government, discussed future tasks, and elected representatives to the Municipal People's Congress.
    At the first first People's Congress meetings held in the districts of Chengdu, the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China was enthusiastically discussed. Before the meeting, more than 680 people's representatives in the city, in coordination with 170 reporters and more than 1,800 propagandists, widely publicized the convening of the People's Congress meeting and the Draft Constitution to the people. The people put forward many suggestions on publicizing and discussing the Draft Constitution. The people's representatives in Xicheng and Wannian districts alone collected 132 proposals related to the Draft Constitution. At the district People's Congress meetings, the people's representatives listened to reports on the Draft Constitution and conducted enthusiastic and serious discussions on the Draft Constitution. Li Hanjiang, a worker and a people's representative from the Dongcheng District, said: The pseudo-constitution of the Kuomintang reactionaries tied us working people tightly like an iron chain. Today's Draft Constitution stipulates that the state is run by us working people. I am determined to dedicate all my strength to the country for the rest of my life. Zhong Qingyun, a Chengdu second-class labor model and old worker, guaranteed to use the practical action of increasing production as a gift to the promulgation of the Draft Constitution. He said: "Our Draft Constitution is a draft constitution for building a socialist society. Only if everyone works hard to increase production can a socialist society come sooner." Cheng Shuzhen, a working woman from the Xicheng District, said: "The Draft Constitution writes about the happiness of the people in every article, and specifically stipulates the protection of women's rights. In the past, I couldn't even make decisions about housework, but today I can manage state affairs. I want to promote the Draft Constitution well among women and be a good representative of the people." After heated discussions, the district meetings unanimously passed resolutions to support the Draft Constitution and to launch publicity and discussion of the Draft Constitution.
