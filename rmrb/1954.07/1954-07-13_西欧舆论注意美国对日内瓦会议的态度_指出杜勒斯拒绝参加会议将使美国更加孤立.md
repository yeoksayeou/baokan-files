Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, July 11th: With Molotov and Mendès-France already here and having conducted talks, and with Zhou Enlai and Eden scheduled to return here on the 12th, the attention of public opinion in Paris, London, and Geneva is now focused on the attitude the United States will adopt toward the new phase of the Geneva Conference in the coming weeks.

All newspapers in Paris carried news that despite urging from the French and British governments, Dulles refused to attend the "final and decisive phase" of the conference. The "Aurore" on the 10th considered this a "cloud on the horizon." "L'Humanité" pointed out on the 10th: "The fact that Dulles will not attend the conference cannot be considered an indication that the US State Department is no longer interested in the Indochina issue. The absence of the US Secretary of State is merely a precaution against the possible success of the talks. This way, the US government can refuse to co-sign an agreement concluded without its active participation and can ‘act freely’ to conclude a bilateral military alliance treaty with Bao Dai." Another major Parisian newspaper, "Libération," said that Dulles' refusal to return to the negotiating table "shows that the American ministers are hesitant, fearing that they would lose face if they participated in negotiations that would defeat those who advocate the internationalization of the war and a crusade against China."

Many French newspapers believe that Dulles' stance against the Geneva Conference will only further isolate the US government. "L'Humanité" said in its editorial on the 9th, "The isolation of American imperialism is becoming increasingly apparent, and the Geneva Conference has played a significant role in exposing the essence of the US government's policies."

Many British newspapers, like their French counterparts, expressed opinions on Dulles' decision not to attend the Geneva Conference. "The Observer" said on the 11th: "London is very displeased with Dulles' statement that neither he nor Mr. Smith intends to return to Geneva. It is believed that this shows how little effect the Washington talks had in coordinating British and American policies."

"The Daily Herald" pointed out on the 9th: "Just when most observers are cautiously optimistic about reaching a ceasefire agreement within the next week, the United States has decided to virtually abstain from the negotiations."

"The Daily Express" said on the 10th: "Paris believes that Dulles' determination to remain in Washington underscores America's decision to continue to avoid ceasefire negotiations." The newspaper added that the French government was extremely "uneasy." The newspaper's headline reporting the return of the foreign ministers of the major powers to Geneva was "Fourth Person (US Ambassador to Czechoslovakia, Mr. Johnson) to Lead the United States in Geneva."

"The Sunday Times" pointed out on the 11th that the real reason for Dulles' attitude was that "Mr. Dulles wishes to avoid associating the Republican government with the settlement of the Indochina issue," considering the upcoming November elections.

One of Geneva's largest daily newspapers, "La Suisse," said in an editorial titled "Washington's Mistake" on the 11th: "Now, we can at most hope that Dulles' refusal to return is not a means for the United States to sabotage the Geneva Conference from afar."

Xinhua News Agency, July 11th: The foreign ministers of the Soviet Union, China, France, and the United Kingdom have successively returned to Geneva to participate in discussions on the restoration of peace in Indochina. However, US Secretary of State Dulles announced in Washington on the 8th that neither he nor Undersecretary of State Smith now intends to return to Geneva to attend the conference.

United Press International Washington reported: The reason Dulles and Smith are not returning to Geneva is that the United States fears that a "peace plan might be accepted"; the United States has "no control" over achieving a ceasefire in Indochina.

The French and British governments have paid close attention to Dulles and Smith's unwillingness to return to Geneva. A US State Department spokesman said that the French government has notified the US government of its "concern" about the matter. French Ambassador to the United States, Bonnet, visited Dulles on the 9th, requesting that the United States send a high-level representative to the conference. Meanwhile, according to United Press International Paris, France has warned the United States that it would be a "very damaging mistake" if the United States did not send a top-level representative to Geneva. The office of French Prime Minister Mendès-France told the US Chargé d'Affaires that the Western alliance would be severely affected if the Eisenhower administration did not ease its "cool" attitude.

In London, British Foreign Office officials said that the British government has also told the US government that the British government would "attach great importance" to Dulles or Smith returning to Geneva.

According to a United Press International dispatch from Geneva, some Western observers believe that this "absence is a manifestation of the United States' open boycott of the Indochina negotiations."

The Associated Press reported that Dulles and Smith are not going to Geneva but are "vigorously engaged" in Washington in establishing a Southeast Asian military bloc, regardless of the progress of the Indochina ceasefire negotiations. They are busy holding talks with diplomatic officials from Thailand, Australia, New Zealand, and the Philippines.

### 西欧舆论注意美国对日内瓦会议的态度  指出杜勒斯拒绝参加会议将使美国更加孤立

    西欧舆论注意美国对日内瓦会议的态度
    指出杜勒斯拒绝参加会议将使美国更加孤立
    【新华社日内瓦十一日电】莫洛托夫和孟戴斯—弗朗斯已经来到这里并且随即进行了会谈，周恩来和艾登预定在十二日回到这里，因此，巴黎、伦敦和日内瓦舆论的注意力现在都集中在今后几星期中美国对日内瓦会议的新阶段所抱的态度上了。
    巴黎所有报纸都登载消息说，尽管法国政府和英国政府曾经进行敦促，杜勒斯还是拒绝参加会议“最后的决定性的阶段”。十日的“震旦报”认为这是“画面上的一块阴云”。“人道报”在十日指出：“不能认为杜勒斯将不出席会议这一事实表明美国国务院不再对印度支那事件感到兴趣。美国国务卿的缺席只不过是为了提防会谈可能成功。这样，美国政府便可以拒绝在没有它积极参加的情况下缔结的协定上连署，并可以‘自由行事’去和保大缔结双边军事同盟条约。”另一家巴黎大报“解放报”说：杜勒斯拒绝回到会议桌旁来，这件事“说明美国的部长们是踌躇不决的，他们担心如果参加了一个会使主张战争国际化和进行反对中国的反共十字军运动的一派人遭到失败的谈判，那他们就会有失体面。”
    许多法国报纸认为，杜勒斯所采取的这种反对日内瓦会议的立场，只会使美国政府更加孤立。“人道报”九日的社论说，“美帝国主义的孤立形势已越来越明显了，日内瓦会议在揭露美国政府的政策的本质方面起了很大作用。”
    英国的许多报纸，也像法国报纸一样，对杜勒斯决定不出席日内瓦会议一事表示了意见。“观察家报”十一日说：“伦敦对杜勒斯发表的、说他和史密斯先生都不打算回日内瓦的声明，感到很不愉快。人们认为这说明华盛顿会谈在协调英美政策方面所起的作用是多么微小。”
    “每日先驱报”九日指出：“正当大多数观察家对在下星期内达成停火协议表示谨慎的乐观的时候，美国决定实际上不参加谈判。”
      “每日快报”十日说：“巴黎方面认为杜勒斯决心留在华盛顿这件事，强调说明美国决定继续避开停火谈判。”这家报纸又说，法国政府感到极为“不安”。这家报纸报道大国外长们回日内瓦的消息的标题是“第四号人物（美国驻捷克斯洛伐克大使约翰逊）在日内瓦领导美国”。
    “星期日泰晤士报”十一日指出，杜勒斯采取这种态度的真正原因是“杜勒斯先生希望避免使共和党政府同印度支那问题的解决发生关系”，因为他考虑到未来的十一月的选举。
    日内瓦最大日报之一“瑞士报”，十一日在以“华盛顿的错误”为题发表的社论中说：“现在，我们至多只能抱这样的希望：杜勒斯拒绝回来这一行动，不致是美国要在遥远的地方破坏日内瓦会议的一种手段。”
    【新华社十一日讯】苏联、中国、法国和英国的外交部长们陆续回到日内瓦，参加恢复印度支那和平问题的讨论。但是，美国国务卿杜勒斯八日在华盛顿宣布，他和副国务卿史密斯现在都不打算回日内瓦去参加会议。
    合众社华盛顿消息说：杜勒斯和史密斯不回日内瓦的原因是，美国担心一个“和平方案可能被接受”；美国对于实现印度支那停火“没有控制权”。
    法国和英国政府对于杜勒斯和史密斯不愿意回日内瓦，十分注意。美国国务院发言人说，法国政府已经把它对这件事的“重视”通知美国政府。法国驻美大使庞纳九日访问了杜勒斯，要求美国派遣高级代表参加会议。同时，据合众社巴黎消息说：法国已警告美国，假如美国不派遣最高级代表去日内瓦，将是一个“为害极大的错误”。法国总理孟戴斯—弗朗斯的办公厅告诉美国代办，假如艾森豪威尔政府不缓和“冷淡”态度的话，西方联盟将受到严重影响。
    在伦敦，英国外交部人士说，英国政府也已告诉美国政府，英国政府将“十分重视”杜勒斯或史密斯回日内瓦。
    据合众社日内瓦电讯说，某些西方观察家认为美国“这种缺席是美国公开的抵制印度支那谈判”的表现。
    美联社报道说，杜勒斯和史密斯不去日内瓦，却在华盛顿“大力从事”建立东南亚军事集团的工作，不管印度支那停战谈判的进展如何。他们正和泰国、澳大利亚、新西兰和菲律宾的外交官员忙着举行会谈。
