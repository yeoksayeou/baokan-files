Xinhua News Agency, July 27th: Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, Zhang Hanfu, issued a statement lodging the most serious protest with the United States government regarding the intrusion of the US Air Force into our country's airspace and the shooting down of two of our patrol aircraft. The full text of the statement is as follows:

On July 26th, a mixed fleet including two US aircraft carriers and several destroyers entered the sea area near the east of Hainan Island, China. At 9:25 AM, four US fighter planes taking off from the carriers intruded into the airspace over Yulin Port, China. At 10:05 AM, another group of twelve US fighter planes intruded into the airspace over Lehui, Hainan Island, attacking two of our patrol aircraft, which were shot down. Subsequently, two more US fighter planes strafed two Polish merchant ships and our escort vessels. After our ships returned fire in self-defense, they fled. This is yet another outrageous act of aggression by US imperialism.

For several years, US imperialism, which occupies our territory of Taiwan, has not only supplied a large number of aircraft, warships, and various military materials to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, directing and supporting the Chiang bandits in constantly harassing the coastal areas and islands of China, airdropping special agents, and carrying out pirate interceptions of merchant ships from various countries coming to trade with our country, but the US Navy and Air Force have also directly intruded into our country's territorial waters and airspace on many occasions. Recently, just as the Geneva Conference was being held and an agreement was reached on the restoration of peace in Indochina, and the international tension was further eased, the US imperialists, in order to save the disgraceful bankruptcy of their policy of strength, have become even more frantic, directing and supporting the Chiang Kai-shek remnant bandit gang to intensify their harassment and piracy against the Chinese mainland. The US Navy and Air Force have also recently expanded their military activities in the southern coastal areas of China. It is precisely because the US and Chiang bandit air forces are constantly carrying out harassing activities in this area that an accidental and unfortunate incident occurred on the morning of July 23rd to a British transport plane in the airspace over Yulin Port, Hainan Island. The United States, using the excuse of rescuing the crashed plane, dispatched fleets and fighter planes even more blatantly and recklessly to carry out aggressive actions against the Chinese people in this area, intruding into our country's airspace, barbarously attacking and shooting down two of our patrol aircraft, and strafing Polish merchant ships and our ships sailing in international waters.

The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China lodges the most serious protest with the United States government against the criminal act of the US Air Force's intrusion into our airspace over Yulin Port and Lehui, and the sudden attack and shooting down of two of our aircraft and the strafing of our ships in the most barbarous manner. The Chinese people express their utmost indignation and condemnation of this despicable act of aggression by the US imperialists. The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China hereby seriously warns the United States government to immediately cease such acts of aggression; otherwise, the United States government will bear all responsibility for the consequences arising from its provocations and will reap what it sows. The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China reserves the right to claim from the United States government compensation for all losses of life and property suffered in the incident in which our two aircraft were shot down.

    美国空军侵犯我领空并击落我飞机两架
    章副外长向美国提最严重抗议
    【新华社二十七日讯】中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部副部长章汉夫发表声明，为美国空军侵犯我国领空并击落我国两架巡逻飞机事，对美国政府提出最严重的抗议。声明全文如下：
    七月二十六日，包括美国航空母舰两艘及驱逐舰若干艘的混合编队，进入我国海南岛东部附近海面，九时二十五分由舰上起飞的美国战斗机四架，侵入我国榆林港上空。十时零五分，又一批美国战斗机十二架侵入我海南岛乐会上空，向我国两架巡逻飞机攻击，我两机遭击落。其后又有美国战斗机两架向波兰商轮两艘及我国的护航舰进行俯冲射击，经我舰自卫还击后逃逸。这是美帝国主义的又一次无法无天的侵略暴行。
    几年来，侵占我国领土台湾的美帝国主义不但以大批飞机、军舰和各种军火物资供给蒋介石匪帮，指使和支持蒋匪向中国沿海地区和岛屿不断进行骚扰，空投特务，对前来我国通商的各国商船进行海盗拦劫，并且美国的海空军也曾多次直接侵入我国领海领空。最近，正当日内瓦会议的举行以及关于恢复印度支那和平问题达成协议，国际紧张局势有了进一步缓和之际，美帝国主义者为了挽救它的实力政策的可耻破产，就更加疯狂，指使和支持蒋介石残余匪帮加紧对中国大陆的进扰及海盗行为。美国海空军最近也扩大其在中国南部沿海地区的军事活动。正因为美国和蒋匪空军在这一区域经常进行骚扰活动，才使七月二十三日晨一架英国运输机在海南岛榆林港上空发生意外不幸事件。而美国竟借口救援失事飞机，派遣舰队和战斗机更加公然无忌地在这一地区进行敌视中国人民的侵略行动，侵犯我国领空，野蛮地袭击并击落我国巡逻飞机两架，俯冲并扫射在公海航行的波兰商船和我国船舰。
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府对于美国空军侵犯我国榆林港和乐会领空和以最野蛮的方式突然袭击并击落我国飞机两架、俯冲和扫射我国船舰的罪恶行动，特向美国政府提出最严重的抗议。中国人民对于美帝国主义者这种卑鄙侵略行为表示无比愤怒的谴责。中华人民共和国中央人民政府为此严重警告美国政府立即停止此类侵犯行动，否则，美国政府将承担由其挑衅所引起的一切责任，并将自食其果。中华人民共和国中央人民政府保留向美国政府追索在我国两架飞机被击落的事件中所遭受的一切生命财产损失的赔偿权利。一九五四年七月二十七日
