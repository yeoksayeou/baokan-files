A short comment:

    The task of geological drilling work is to provide complete and correct geological data for design work. It is the foundation of design work. Only with complete geological data can we guarantee the correctness of the design and meet the requirements of basic construction. If the geological data is wrong, the design will be fundamentally wrong. Construction based on this design will have unimaginable consequences for factory and mine construction. Therefore, the task undertaken by geological drilling workers in national economic construction is extremely important and glorious.

    In recent years, many of our geological drilling personnel have been working hard and achieving results. They travel around in the field all year round, overcoming many difficulties in life and work, clarifying the partial situation of the country's underground resources, and ensuring the needs of production and basic construction. However, there are also a small number of people among the geological drilling personnel who have not realized the importance of their responsibilities, conscientiously doing their work well, and guaranteeing the provision of complete geological data according to national requirements. Instead, they are focused on pursuing illegal personal interests, adopting various bad means, falsely reporting drilling quality, defrauding bonuses, and sacrificing the national economic construction cause at all costs. The incident of the Fengfeng Mining Bureau's drilling team falsely reporting drilling quality is one of the most serious examples. This bad behavior of falsely reporting drilling quality destroys the correctness of geological data, which may cause a series of fundamental errors in future production and basic construction, causing huge losses to the country.

    The reason why the Fengfeng Mining Bureau's drilling team has a fairly widespread and long-standing phenomenon of falsely reporting drilling quality is inseparable from the fact that the leaders at all levels of the bureau generally have the idea of ​​only seeking progress and disregarding quality, and often ignore the political and ideological education of employees. What these leaders care about is only the drilling footage. They do not care much about how to collect and keep the cores, and even see coal and rock cores being placed everywhere, exposed to wind and rain, and do not care about it. Their leadership of geological drilling work is not to adopt the method of combining political work with economic work, but simply to use material rewards to achieve the purpose of so-called encouraging employees' production enthusiasm. What is particularly serious is that they know that some teams have lost coal, but they still give rewards again and again because of the so-called "over-fulfillment of tasks." This wrong method not only fails to encourage the correct production enthusiasm of employees, but instead encourages the bad behavior of grassroots cadres neglecting quality and falsely reporting results.

    What needs to be pointed out in particular is that this behavior of falsely reporting drilling quality is not only present in the Fengfeng Mining Bureau's drilling team. Even in the coal mine system, similar situations exist to varying degrees in some regions and departments. This should arouse our high vigilance. The leading departments of geological drilling at all levels should learn from the experience and lessons of the Fengfeng Mining Bureau, earnestly strengthen political and ideological work, and conduct regular and in-depth inspections to prevent the recurrence of similar incidents; such problems that have already occurred should be dealt with seriously, and through these specific incidents, all geological drilling personnel should be educated to truly establish the idea of ​​quality first and ensure the comprehensive completion of the national geological drilling tasks.

### 必须肃清假报钻探质量的恶劣行为

    必须肃清假报钻探质量的恶劣行为
    地质钻探工作的任务是供给设计工作以完整正确的地质资料，它是设计工作的基础，只有首先具备了完整的地质资料，才有可能保证作出正确的设计，从而满足基本建设施工的要求。如果地质资料错误了，所作出来的设计就会从根本上发生错误，依据这种设计施工，工厂和矿井建设就将发生难以设想的恶果。因之地质钻探工作者在国家经济建设中所担负的任务是极其重大和光荣的。
    我们许多地质钻探人员，近年来在工作上是努力的和有成绩的，他们整年在野外奔波，克服了许多生活上和工作上的困难，弄清了祖国地下资源的部分情况，保证了生产和基本建设的需要。但是地质钻探人员中也有很少的一部分人，他们没有认识到自己责任的重大，兢兢业业地把工作作好，保证按照国家要求提出完整的地质资料，而是一心追求个人的非法利益，采取各种恶劣手段，虚报钻探质量，骗取奖金，不惜损害国家经济建设事业。峰峰矿务局钻探队虚报钻探质量的事件，就是最严重的例子之一。这种虚报钻探质量的恶劣行为，破坏了地质资料的正确性，使今后的生产和基本建设可能发生一系列的根本错误，给国家造成巨大的损失。
    峰峰矿务局钻探队所以存在着相当普遍和相当长时间的假报钻探质量的现象，是和该局各级领导普遍存在着只求进度不顾质量的思想，以及经常忽视职工的政治思想教育分不开的。这些领导人关心的只是钻探进尺，对于如何把岩心采好，保管好等等则很不关心，甚至看到煤心岩心到处乱放，任其遭受风吹雨打，也不加过问。他们领导地质钻探工作不是采取政治工作与经济工作相结合的方法，而是单纯的以物质奖励来达到所谓鼓舞职工生产情绪的目的。尤其严重的是明知有的队打丢了煤，却还因所谓“超额完成任务”而一再给予奖励。这种错误的方法不但不能鼓舞起职工正确的生产情绪，反而助长了基层干部忽视质量、假报成绩的恶劣行为。
    特别需要指出的是：这种假报钻探质量的行为，目前不是仅仅存在于峰峰矿务局钻探队一个单位，即以煤矿系统来说，有些地区和部门也不同程度的存在着类似的情况。这就更应当引起我们高度的警惕。各级地质钻探领导部门应当吸取峰峰矿务局的这一经验教训，切实加强政治思想工作，经常深入检查，防止类似事件的再度发生；对已经发生的这类问题，则应严肃地处理，并通过这些具体事件，教育全体地质钻探人员，真正确立起质量第一的思想，保证全面完成国家的地质钻探任务。
