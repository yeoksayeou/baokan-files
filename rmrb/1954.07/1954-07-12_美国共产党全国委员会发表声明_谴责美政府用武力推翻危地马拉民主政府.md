(Xinhua News Agency, July 11th) According to a TASS report from New York on July 10th: The National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States issued a statement condemning the act of overthrowing the democratic government of Guatemala.

The statement said: "The forcible overthrow of the democratic government of Guatemala has shocked world opinion. Hundreds of millions of people have seen in this event international gangster tactics learned from Hitler's skills. They have seen in this brutal armed attack on a practically defenseless country with just over two million people, and in the seizure of power in this country by a fifth column, yet another shocking act of aggression by Wall Street trusts."

The statement continued: "The military government that rules Guatemala today is essentially a government of the 'United Fruit Company.' It is a fascist military dictatorship, whose overlord is the American Ambassador John Peurifoy. The puppet soldiers, acting on his instructions, have established a reign of terror. As they themselves admit, they have arrested two thousand people and plan to establish concentration camps. They routinely label all those arrested as 'communists,' but among them, in addition to communists, are non-communists—trade union activists and members of peasant associations, students, members of bourgeois democratic parties, and members of other democratic organizations."

The statement pointed out the protests of the Chilean, Uruguayan, and Argentine Houses of Representatives and the protests of millions of trade union activists and others throughout Latin America and other countries, all of whom unanimously condemned the attack on the democratic government of Guatemala.

The National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States finally demanded an end to the persecution of democratic people in Guatemala and the recall of the US Ambassador to Guatemala, Peurifoy.

    美国共产党全国委员会发表声明
    谴责美政府用武力推翻危地马拉民主政府
    【新华社十一日讯】据塔斯社纽约十日讯：美国共产党全国委员会发表声明，谴责推翻危地马拉民主政府的行为。
    声明说：“危地马拉民主政府被人用武力推翻了，这件事震动了全世界的舆论。亿万人都在这一事件中看到了从希特勒的武艺中学来的国际强盗手段。他们从这次对一个实际上没有防御、仅拥有两百多万人的国家进行残酷的武装进攻中，从第五纵队夺取这个国家的政权中，看到了华尔街托辣斯的又一次令人吃惊的侵略行为。”
    声明接着说：“今天统治着危地马拉的军政府实质上是‘联合果品公司’牌的政府。这是一个法西斯军事独裁政府，它的太上皇就是美国大使约翰·普里弗伊。傀儡军人按照他的指示建立了恐怖的统治。如他们自己所承认的，他们已逮捕了两千人，并打算建立集中营。他们把全部被捕的人都照例称之为‘共产党员’，但除共产党员之外，其中还有非共产党人——工会活动家和农民协会的会员、学生、资产阶级民主政党的党员及其他民主组织的人士。”
    声明指出智利、乌拉圭和阿根廷各国众议院的抗议和整个拉丁美洲及其他国家的千千万万工会活动家等人士的抗议，他们都一致谴责对危地马拉民主政府的进攻。
    美国共产党全国委员会最后要求停止迫害危地马拉的民主人士和召回美国驻危地马拉大使普里弗伊。
