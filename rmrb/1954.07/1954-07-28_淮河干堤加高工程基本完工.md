The one million cubic meter earthwork project to raise the Huai River main embankment by one meter has exceeded the plan in a short period of about ten days due to the active efforts of the broad masses of migrant workers and cadres. As of July 20, with the exception of a few embankment sections where the heightening project has not been fully completed, the earthwork completed in most embankment sections is approximately 1.2 million cubic meters. It is generally paved smoothly, compacted firmly, and of good quality.

To further protect the safety of the embankment, on the basis of the basic completion of the heightening project, wave protection projects are now being stepped up on the inner slope platforms of the northern embankment of the middle reaches of the Huai River and the entire length of the Wo River, a total of more than 700 li of river embankment. This project requires a large amount of earthwork, and many migrant workers are involved. The total earthwork planned for this project in the Suxian Prefecture alone is 250,000 cubic meters, and approximately 120,000 migrant workers are participating in the project. Upon completion, the project will not only be able to withstand wind and waves and protect the embankment body, but also serve as reserve soil for emergency blocking of dangerous breaches. At present, the progress of projects in various places is very rapid, and the projects in Huaiyuan, Wuhe, and Sihong counties have recently been fully completed.

    淮河干堤加高工程基本完工
    淮河干堤加高一公尺的一百万公方土方工程，由于广大民工干部的积极努力，在短短十天左右已经超额完成了计划。截至七月二十日统计，除少数堤段尚未完全完成加高工程外，大部堤段已完成的土方大约有一百二十万公方，一般铺的平整，夯的结实，质量良好。
    为进一步保护堤防安全，在加高工程基本完成的基础上，现又开始在淮河中游北堤和涡河全线共约七百多里的河堤内坡平台上，加紧修建挡浪工程。这一工程需要的土方数字很大，投入这一工程的民工也很多，仅宿县专区计划修建这一工程的总土方就有二十五万公方，参加该项工程的民工约计十二万人。工程完成后不仅可以抵挡风浪，保护埂身，而且还可在抢堵险口时作预备土用。目前各地工程进展都很迅速，怀远、五河、泗洪等县的工程最近已全部完成。
