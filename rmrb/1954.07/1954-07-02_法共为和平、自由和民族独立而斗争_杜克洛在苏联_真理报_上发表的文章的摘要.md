Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 30th (TASS dispatch): "Pravda" published an article from Paris by Jacques Duclos, entitled "The French Communist Party Fights for Peace, Freedom, and National Independence." He pointed out that the 13th Congress of the French Communist Party, held in Ivry, a suburb of Paris, in early June, demonstrated the working class's fervent patriotism and their unwavering determination to save France from decline.

    At the congress, moving expressions of proletarian internationalism demonstrated the full significance of the policy of national independence advocated by our party.

    The congress summarized the achievements in the struggle for peace. The congress emphasized the need to strive for more active participation of the working class in this struggle and to establish peace committees in various industrial enterprises, which would make the struggle against the ratification of the "European Defence Community" treaty more effective.

    Duclos said: The French Communist Party faces a huge task of decisive significance for the future of France. It is necessary to smash the conspiracies of the US imperialists and their French agents. They want to enslave France by dragging it into the "European Defence Community" – a guise for reviving German militarism.

    Relentless efforts must be made to ensure that the masses of people, led by the working class, participate in the struggle, as they are capable of preventing the "European Defence Community" treaty from being ratified.

    It is necessary to prevent the American warmongers and their French accomplices from continuing and expanding the Indochina War.

    France's foreign policy must undergo a fundamental change so that France can break free from American control, enabling it to adopt a policy in all aspects that conforms to the will of the people and prevents the realization of the war conspiracies of the American imperialists and German revanchists.

    Duclos concluded: After the 13th Congress of the French Communist Party, our party has become stronger and more united, better equipped with theory, and more capable of leading the working class and the masses in the struggle for national independence and peace, for democratic freedom, for satisfying the demands of the working people, and for the victory of socialism.

    法共为和平、自由和民族独立而斗争
    ——杜克洛在苏联“真理报”上发表的文章的摘要
    【新华社一日讯】塔斯社莫斯科六月三十日讯：“真理报”刊载了雅克·杜克洛自巴黎寄来的一篇文章，题为“法国共产党为和平、自由和民族独立而斗争”。他指出：六月初在巴黎郊区依夫列举行的法国共产党第十三次代表大会，显示出工人阶级热情的爱国主义和他们的把法国从衰落中拯救出来的不屈不挠的决心。
    在代表大会上，无产阶级国际主义的动人的表现显示了我们党所拥护的民族独立政策的全部重要意义。
    大会总结了争取和平的斗争的成绩。大会强调必须争取工人阶级更积极地参加这个斗争，并在各工业企业设立和平委员会，这会使得反对批准“欧洲防务集团”条约的斗争更为有效。
    杜克洛说：法国共产党面临着对法国前途具有决定性意义的巨大任务。必须粉碎美帝国主义者和他们的法国代理人的阴谋。他们想通过把法国拖入“欧洲防务集团”——复活德国军国主义的幌子——的办法来奴役法国。
    必须进行不懈的努力使得以工人阶级为首的人民群众参加斗争，他们是能够阻止“欧洲防务集团”条约获得批准的。
    必须防止美国战争制造者和他们的法国同谋者继续并扩大印度支那战争的可能性。
    法国的外交政策必须有根本的改变，以便法国能够摆脱美国的控制，使得它能够在各方面采取一种符合于人民意志的政策，并阻止美国帝国主义者和德国复仇主义者的战争阴谋实现。
    杜克洛最后说：在法国共产党第十三次代表大会以后，我们的党变得更强大和更团结，更好地用理论装备起来，并且更能够领导工人阶级和群众为民族独立和和平，为民主自由，为满足劳动群众的要求，为社会主义的胜利而斗争。
