Xinhua News Agency, July 22nd: On the same day that the Geneva Conference agreement on restoring peace in Indochina was announced, U.S. President Eisenhower announced at a press conference in Washington that the United States was "studying" a military so-called "mutual defense treaty" with the Chiang Kai-shek remnant bandits. The day before, Rankin, the newly returned U.S. so-called ambassador to Taiwan, met with Eisenhower in the White House. Rankin also publicly told reporters upon leaving the White House that negotiations between the U.S. and Chiang on the conclusion of a "mutual defense treaty" were underway in Washington and Taipei. On the same day, Chiang Kai-shek's "Foreign Minister" Yeh Kung-chao also confirmed this. Meanwhile, Chiang Kai-shek's "ambassador" to the United States, Gu Weijun, after holding successive talks with U.S. Vice President Nixon, Secretary of State Dulles, and Noland and other leading figures of the pro-Chiang group in the U.S. Congress, rushed back to Taiwan on the 20th to report. According to Pan-Asia News Agency on the 21st, which has close ties with the Chiang Kai-shek gang, the United States and Chiang Kai-shek will accelerate negotiations, and the Chiang Kai-shek gang hopes to sign the aforementioned bilateral treaty before the end of this year.

The U.S. government's adoption of this provocative action, which is intolerable to the Chinese people, and its intensification of collusion with Chiang Kai-shek, a degenerate despised by the world, to threaten China for a long time and prevent the establishment of comprehensive peace in Asia, is clearly a pre-determined step. After the U.S. plot to expand the Indochina war was shattered by the successful conclusion of the Indochina armistice agreement at the Geneva Conference, the U.S. authorities were unwilling to give up. Therefore, further using the so-called bilateral treaty to turn Taiwan into a long-term U.S. aggression base and intensifying the use of Taiwan to expand aggression against China has become an important item on the U.S. aggression plan in the Far East. Therefore, the U.S. ruling clique has recently particularly emphasized the importance of aiding the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Taiwan. Washington's military leaders openly stated that Taiwan is an "important link" in the U.S. aggression plan in the Pacific, and the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee also emphasized that Taiwan is an important stronghold on the encirclement of China from Japan to the Philippines. According to a France-Presse report from Taipei on the 20th, Chiang Kai-shek gang members are extremely hopeful that their American masters can give them a little more color, and shamelessly boast that after the Indochina armistice is realized, "the United States will have to rely more on Taiwan and South Korea to establish its strategic defense (military aggression)." They also said that "when the Korean War stopped, the speed of military supplies to the Kuomintang army almost doubled." Now, after the Indochina armistice, "the United States will greatly increase military aid to the Kuomintang army" "and give stronger guarantees." Facts prove that the U.S. authorities are also seizing the traitor Chiang Kai-shek as a straw to be their capital for their aggressive policies.

The U.S. attempt to use the so-called U.S.-Chiang bilateral treaty to solidify the U.S. occupation of our territory Taiwan, thereby turning Taiwan into a long-term U.S. aggression base, has aroused great anger and firm opposition from the Chinese people, and at the same time, it is bound to arouse universal opposition from peace-loving people, Asian people, and all righteous people in the world. Obviously, the U.S. ruling clique, which has repeatedly failed in its attempt to resist the historical process, is not only unwilling to learn lessons from reality, but also more stubbornly adheres to the bankrupt policy of aggression against the Chinese people and creating tension in the Far East. However, it is foreseeable that this U.S. practice of relying on scum like Chiang Kai-shek to wantonly provoke and isolate itself from the peace-loving people of Asia and the world can only bring tragic consequences to themselves.

    美国统治集团企图和蒋匪帮缔结军事条约
    变台湾为美国长期侵略基地扩大侵略我国
    【新华社二十二日讯】在日内瓦会议关于恢复印度支那和平的协议签字消息公布的同一天，美国总统艾森豪威尔就在华盛顿举行的记者招待会上宣布，美国正在“研究”和蒋介石残匪缔结军事性的所谓“共同防御条约”。在前一天，新近返美的美国驻台湾的所谓大使兰金和艾森豪威尔进行了会商，兰金在离开白宫时也向记者公开表示，美蒋之间关于订立“共同防御条约”的谈判正在华盛顿和台北进行中。同日，蒋匪“外交部长”叶公超也证实了这一点。同时，蒋匪驻美“大使”顾维钧在和美国副总统尼克松、国务卿杜勒斯以及美国国会中援蒋集团的首脑人物诺兰等人先后举行会谈以后，已在二十日赶回台湾报告。据和蒋匪帮有密切关系的泛亚社二十一日透露，美蒋之间将加速谈判，蒋匪帮希望在今年年底以前签订上述双边条约。
    美国政府采取这种为中国人民所不能容忍的挑衅行动，加紧勾结为全世界所不齿的败类蒋介石来长期威胁中国、阻止亚洲全面和平的建立，显然是它预定的步骤。美国扩大印度支那战争的阴谋因日内瓦会议圆满地达成印度支那停战的协议而遭到粉碎后，美国当局是死不甘心的，因此，进一步利用所谓双边条约来变台湾为美国的长期的侵略基地并加紧利用台湾来扩大对中国的侵略，就成为美国在远东侵略计划的日程表上的重要项目。因此美国统治集团最近特别强调援助台湾蒋匪的重要性。华盛顿的军事首脑公开表示，台湾是美国在太平洋的侵略计划中的“重要环节”，美国参议院外交委员会也强调指出台湾是从日本到菲律宾的对中国的包围圈上的重要据点。据法新社二十日台北消息，蒋匪帮分子极望美国主子能多给他们一点颜色，更无耻地吹嘘说，印度支那停战实现以后，“美国将不得不更加依赖台湾和南朝鲜来建立它的战略防御（军事侵略）”。他们还说，“当朝鲜战争停止时，对国民党军队运送的军事供应品的速度差不多增加了一倍”，现在，在印度支那停战后，“美国将大量增加对国民党军队的军事援助”，“并给予更强有力的保证”。事实证明，美国当局也正在抓紧卖国贼蒋介石这个稻草人来作他们的侵略政策的资本。
    美国企图利用美蒋所谓双边条约来把美国强占我国领土台湾的情况固定化，从而变台湾为美国长期的侵略基地的阴谋，引起了中国人民极大的愤怒和坚决的反对，同时它必然要引起世界爱好和平人民、亚洲人民和一切正义人士的普遍反对。显然，企图抗拒历史进程而连遭失败的美国统治集团不但不肯从现实中领受教训，而且更顽固地坚持已经破了产的侵略中国人民和制造远东紧张局势的政策。但是，可以预见，美国这种依靠蒋介石之类的渣滓来恣意挑衅而自绝于亚洲和世界各国爱好和平人民的做法，只能给他们自己带来悲惨的结局。
