Anshan Iron and Steel Company's newly built Second Thin Plate Plant was officially put into production on July 20th. On this day, the workers of the Thin Plate Plant were as happy as if they were celebrating a festival. After the ribbon-cutting ceremony in the morning, Han Tianshi, Secretary of the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, Wang Yuqing, Deputy General Manager of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, and Soviet experts visited the production process of the Thin Plate Plant. The steel rolling workers sitting at the two rows of operating tables in the center of the factory building inquired about the preparation status with relevant workers through loudspeakers, and then pressed the electric buttons in front of them. At this time, the machines throughout the factory started to run, and red-hot thin steel plates, like newspapers coming out of a printing press, were rolled out one after another. Amidst the roar of the machines, the visitors smiled and chatted, some gesturing to express their joy at this new achievement in China's industrialization. By 4:00 p.m. that day, including the finished products trial-rolled in the previous few days, several thousand thin plates had been packaged and delivered to the warehouse. These thin plates are produced according to the ordering requirements of many enterprises in Shanghai, Tianjin, Shenyang, Fushun and other cities. Among them, there are thin plates needed by the petroleum industry, thin plates needed for manufacturing textile machinery, mining machinery, boilers, locomotives, ships, etc., and also thin plates needed for manufacturing agricultural tools, bicycles, scientific instruments, etc. These thin plates will soon be shipped from Anshan to all parts of the country.

On the morning of the 20th, a grand completion signing ceremony was held in the conference room of Anshan Iron and Steel Company. The director of the Second Thin Plate Plant reported on the situation since the hot trial rolling at the meeting. He said: The trial rolling results show that the qualification rate of finished products is very high, and most of them are first-class products. This proves that the quality of the equipment and construction projects that the Soviet Union helped us with is all excellent. At the meeting, Han Tianshi, Secretary of the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, Li Weimin, Deputy Mayor of the Anshan Municipal People's Government, and Wang Yuqing, Deputy General Manager of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, all spoke. They expressed their gratitude to the Soviet people and Soviet experts on behalf of the people of Anshan City and all the workers of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, thanked the people from all over the country who supported the construction of the Second Thin Plate Plant, and expressed their condolences and congratulations to the workers who built the Second Thin Plate Plant and quickly mastered the production technology. Soviet expert Romanenko and others who helped build Anshan Iron and Steel also spoke at the meeting. They wished the workers to quickly exceed the original design capacity in producing thin plates urgently needed by the country. At the signing ceremony, the congratulatory telegram from the Ministry of Heavy Industry of the Central People's Government to the Soviet experts who helped build Anshan Iron and Steel and the congratulatory telegram to all the workers of Anshan Iron and Steel were also read out.

    鞍钢新建第二薄板厂投入生产
    试轧成品合格率很高大部分是一级品
    鞍山钢铁公司新建第二薄板厂七月二十日正式投入生产了。这一天，薄板厂的职工们像迎接节日一样地高兴。上午举行剪彩仪式后，中共鞍山市委员会书记韩天石、鞍山钢铁公司副总经理王玉清和苏联专家等，参观了薄板厂的生产过程。坐在厂房中央两排操作台里的轧钢工人们，通过扩音器和有关的工友互相询问了准备的情况以后，就按动了眼前的电钮。这时，全厂的机器转动起来，通红的薄钢板像报纸从印刷机里钻出来似的，两块接着两块地轧出来了。参观的人们在机器的轰鸣中，有的微笑交谈着，有的打着手势表达他们对我国工业化这一新成就的喜悦。这一天轧到下午四时，连同前几天试轧出的成品，已有几千张薄板包装交库。这些薄板都是按照上海、天津、沈阳、抚顺等城市的许多企业的订货要求生产的。其中有石油工业需要的薄板，有制造纺织机械、采矿机械、锅炉、机车、船舶等需要的薄板，也有制造农具、自行车、科学仪器等需要的薄板。这些薄板，不久就可从鞍山启运到全国各地。
    二十日上午，在鞍山钢铁公司会议室举行了隆重的完工签字仪式。第二薄板厂厂长在会上报告了热试轧以来的情况。他说：试轧结果，成品合格率很高，而且大部分是一级品。这证明苏联帮助我们的设备和建筑工程的质量，全部是优等的。会上，中共鞍山市委员会书记韩天石、鞍山市人民政府副市长李维民、鞍山钢铁公司副总经理王玉清都讲了话。他们代表鞍山市人民和鞍山钢铁公司全体职工向苏联人民和苏联专家致谢，向支援第二薄板厂建设的各地人民表示感谢，并向建设第二薄板厂和很快掌握生产技术的职工们表示慰问和祝贺。帮助建设鞍钢的苏联专家罗曼柯等也在会上讲了话。他们预祝职工们在生产国家迫切需要的薄板中，很快地超过原来的设计能力。签字仪式会上还宣读了中央人民政府重工业部给帮助建设鞍钢的苏联专家的致谢电和给鞍钢全体职工的贺电。　　（新华社）
