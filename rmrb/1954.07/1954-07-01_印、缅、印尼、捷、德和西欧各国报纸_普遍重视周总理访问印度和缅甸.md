Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 30th -- Indian public opinion universally welcomes and values Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to India. During Premier Zhou Enlai's three-day visit to India, newspapers all over India published news of his activities and speeches daily and published editorials welcoming Premier Zhou Enlai, believing that his trip strengthened the friendship between China and India and promoted the cause of peace in Asia and the world.

Almost all Indian newspapers published Premier Zhou Enlai's statements and speeches during his visit to India, including: his speech at the banquet held by Prime Minister Nehru for him on June 26, his answers to questions raised by reporters at the press conference on June 27, his speech at the welcome meeting of people from all walks of life in Delhi on June 27, his radio address to the Indian people on All India Radio, as well as his talk at the Delhi airport upon arrival and his farewell statement upon leaving New Delhi.

During Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to India, many Indian newspapers and magazines published special issues introducing China and the new life of the Chinese people. Many newspapers and magazines also published poems by famous Indian poets congratulating the new China.

The "Crossroads" of Calcutta published a commentary on June 29, saying that Premier Zhou Enlai's speeches and talks on many occasions in New Delhi during his visit to India "not only expressed New China's sincerity to India, but also expressed New China's eagerness to establish peace throughout Asia."

The "Hindustan Standard" said: "The Nehru-Zhou talks have been recognized as opening up a new way to solve the problems of Asian security and peace." The newspaper said: "For the first time, the prime ministers of the two largest Asian countries have shown in the most serious manner that despite the different social systems and political systems of the countries concerned, friendly cooperation for peace is possible."

The "Indian Express" said: The joint statement by the Chinese and Indian prime ministers should be of "particular significance" to those who have been unwilling to admit that the awakening of Asia is the main factor in the international situation. The newspaper said: "The Chinese Premier's answers at the press conference and his radio speech show that the two leaders are extremely eager to maintain and develop mutual friendship, national independence and world peace."

The "Amrita Bazar Patrika" said: "Zhou Enlai's visit to the Indian capital is an event of great significance in the history of rising Asia."
Xinhua News Agency, 30th -- Rangoon News: Burmese newspapers warmly welcome Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to Burma.

Rangoon's "Burma New Light" published an editorial entitled "Welcome Zhou Enlai's Visit to Burma." The editorial said: We believe that Premier Zhou Enlai's visit will make the Burmese people jubilant and encouraged. During Premier Zhou Enlai's stay in Rangoon, the entire Burmese people will show their sincere and warm welcome, and this sincere emotion comes from the depths of their hearts. The editorial also stated that China and Burma have close friendly relations, and that the meeting between the two prime ministers will surely further strengthen the friendship between the two countries.

Mandalay's "People's Daily" published an editorial entitled "Long Live Sino-Burmese Friendship," saying, "The news of Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to Burma at the invitation of Prime Minister U Nu has made us feel greatly encouraged and excited. We express our warm cheers and gratitude for the meeting of the two prime ministers." The editorial pointed out, "At a time when imperialism is clamoring for war and conspiring to establish military blocs for aggression, Sino-Burmese friendship is a matter of vital importance to us." The editorial also pointed out that China and Burma are adjacent to each other, and have had close economic and cultural ties since ancient times. Therefore, mutual understanding and friendship between China and Burma are very important. The editorial believes that the meeting between the prime ministers of China and Burma will promote the friendship and peace desired by the people of China and Burma.
Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 29th -- For several days, newspapers in Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia, have been publishing news of Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to India and the statements of Premier Zhou Enlai and Prime Minister Nehru in prominent positions.

"Dongxing Daily," "Quanyuan Daily," "Social Messenger," and "Indonesia News" used the same title on the 29th: "The Fate of the Asian People is No Longer Decided by External Forces."

The title of "Greater Indonesia Daily" is: "The Talks Between Zhou Enlai and Nehru Have Achieved Good Results."

The titles of "People's Daily" and "Indonesian Torch" are: "Asian People Want Peace, the Threat of War Comes from Outside."
Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 29th -- "Red Rights" published a commentary on the 27th on the talks between Premier Zhou Enlai and Prime Minister Nehru in New Delhi, saying: "The talks in New Delhi will not only be a new development in the Far East and the Geneva Conference, but also show some very interesting and prominent characteristics, from which it can be seen the development of the international situation, the increasing international importance of China, and the increasingly strong desire of Asian countries to decide their own affairs without foreign interference."

"Red Rights" emphasized: The talks between Zhou Enlai and Nehru clearly illustrate how the principle of resolving international issues through peaceful consultation and agreement—regardless of how different the political structures of the negotiating countries may be—is being applied to international life on an ever-expanding scale. The meeting of the two politicians is also a new failure of the monopoly capitalist groups' conspiracy to isolate the People's Republic of China, exclude it from international life, and organize a hostile front of countries that is not only against China but also against the entire peace camp led by the Soviet Union.

"People's Defense" pointed out: Zhou Enlai's visit to the Indian capital has attracted more attention from the world's newspapers than the US-British talks currently being held in Washington, "which is by no means accidental," because "in Washington, the US government is trying to force British representatives to surrender to the dictates of the US aggressive policy, while the leaders of China and India are discussing ways to strengthen world peace in the talks in New Delhi."
Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 29th -- Major newspapers in the democratic district of Berlin published the news of the meeting between our Premier Zhou Enlai and Indian Prime Minister Nehru in prominent positions on the 28th. "Daily Review" published Premier Zhou's speech at the press conference and his statement before leaving New Delhi under the headline "Sino-Indian Friendship - A Guarantee of Peace in Asia." "Neues Deutschland" published the full text of the joint statement of Premier Zhou and Prime Minister Nehru under the large headline "Close Sino-Indian Cooperation."
Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 29th -- Western European newspapers have been publishing news of Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to India in prominent positions in recent days.

The "Hamburg People's News" said in the titles of its reports on this news on the 25th and 26th that Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to India further consolidated the friendship between China and India.

Belgium's "Red Flag" published on its front page on the 26th the news of the warm welcome of the Indian people to Premier Zhou Enlai.

The Italian "Unità" on the 26th and the Danish "Land og Folk" on the 27th also published the news of Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to India with great length.
Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, 29th -- London newspapers published the joint statement issued by the Prime Ministers of China and India in New Delhi on the 28th in prominent positions on the 29th. "The Times" published a report by its correspondent in New Delhi under the headline "The Theme of the Delhi Talks - Peace in Southeast Asia." The report said: "It is believed here that this visit may have a profound impact on Asian relations." After introducing the main points of the joint statement, including the famous Five Principles, "The Times" said: "Observers here quickly pointed out that the ceasefire and military solution in Indochina seem to have been taken for granted. The agreed goals for a political solution in Indochina have also aroused great interest." The newspaper pointed out: "The 'Hindustan Times' praised the Five Principles and said that, contrary to these principles, Mr. Dulles' Southeast Asian defense proposal would divide Asia into hostile systems like Europe, thus making conflict inevitable."

"News Chronicle" published the joint statement of the Prime Ministers of China and India under the headline "Zhou Enlai and Nehru Call for Peace." The newspaper's editorial quoted Premier Zhou Enlai's speech at the banquet held by Nehru on the 26th, saying, "The era when foreign forces can freely decide the fate of Asia is over." The editorial said that the joint statement of the Prime Ministers of China and India "sharply rejects foreign interference in Indochina."

The editorial of "The Daily Worker" said: "An agreement similar to the agreement reached between China and Burma and in New Delhi will be another blow to the strategy of 'using Asians to fight Asians' and will help the freedom of Indochina and the peace of Southeast Asia."

Other major British newspapers also published the main contents and the Five Principles of the joint statement of the Prime Ministers of China and India.

    印、缅、印尼、捷、德和西欧各国报纸
    普遍重视周总理访问印度和缅甸
    【新华社新德里三十日电】印度舆论普遍欢迎和重视中华人民共和国总理周恩来访问印度。在周恩来总理在印度的历时三天的访问期间，印度各地的报纸每天都刊载关于他的活动和演说的消息，并发表社论欢迎周恩来总理，认为他此行加强了中印两国的友谊，并促进了亚洲与世界和平的事业。
    差不多所有的印度报纸都刊载了周恩来总理在访印期间发表的声明和演说，包括：他在六月二十六日尼赫鲁总理为他举行的宴会上的致词，他在六月二十七日记者招待会上对记者提出的问题的答复，他在六月二十七日在德里各界人民欢迎会上的讲话，他在全印广播电台向印度人民发表的广播演说，以及他到达德里机场时发表的谈话和他离开新德里时发表的临别声明。
    在周恩来总理访印期间，许多印度报纸和杂志都出版了介绍中国的专刊，介绍中国人民的新生活。许多报纸杂志还刊载了印度著名诗人祝贺新中国的诗篇。
    加尔各答“划时代报”六月二十九日发表评论说，周恩来总理在访印期间在新德里的许多场合发表的演说和谈话“不仅表示了新中国对印度的诚意，而且表示了新中国对建立全亚洲和平的热切愿望”。
      “印度斯坦旗报”说：“尼赫鲁—周恩来的会谈已被公认为打开了解决亚洲安全与和平的问题的新途径。”这家报纸说：“两个最大的亚洲国家的总理第一次以最认真的态度表明：尽管有关的国家存在着不同的社会制度和政治制度，为和平进行友好合作是可能的。”
    “印度快报”说：中印两国总理联合声明对那些一直不愿承认亚洲的觉醒是国际局势的主要因素的人应该是有“特别重要的意义的”。这家报纸说：“中国总理在记者招待会上的回答和广播演说中都表明了这两位领袖是极力希望保持并发展相互的友谊、民族的独立和世界和平的。”
    “甘露市场报”说：“周恩来访问印度首都是兴起中的亚洲的历史上的具有极大意义的事件。”
    【新华社三十日讯】仰光消息：缅甸报纸热烈欢迎周恩来总理访问缅甸。
    仰光“缅甸新光报”以“欢迎周恩来访缅”为题发表社论。社论说：我们相信周恩来总理的访问会使缅甸人民欢腾鼓舞。在周恩来总理在仰光停留的期间，全缅甸人民将显示其真诚和热烈的欢迎情绪，而这种真诚情绪是发自内心深处的。社论并表示，中国和缅甸有密切的友好关系，两国总理的会晤必能进一步加强两国间的友谊。
    曼德勒“人民报”以“中缅友好万岁”为题发表社论说，“周恩来总理应吴努总理的邀请访问缅甸的消息，使我们感到莫大的鼓舞和兴奋。对两位总理的会晤我们表示热烈的欢呼和感谢。”社论指出，“在帝国主义正叫嚣战争和阴谋策动建立军事集团以进行侵略的时候，中缅两国友好对我们是一个生死攸关的重要问题。”社论并指出中缅两国国土毗连，在经济和文化上很早就有着密切的联系，因此中缅两国的彼此了解和友好是非常重要的。社论认为，中缅两国总理的会晤将促进为中缅两国人民所渴望的友好与和平。
    【新华社雅加达二十九日电】几天以来，印尼首都雅加达各报连续以显著地位刊载周恩来总理访问印度的消息以及周恩来总理和尼赫鲁总理的声明。
    “东星报”、“泉源报”、“社会使者报”和“印尼新闻报”二十九日用了相同的标题：“亚洲人民的命运不再为外力所决定”。
    “大印尼报”的标题是：“周恩来和尼赫鲁的会谈取得良好结果”。
    “人民日报”和“印尼火炬报”的标题是：“亚洲人民要和平，战争威胁来自外面”。
   【新华社布拉格二十九日电】“红色权利报”二十七日就周恩来总理和尼赫鲁总理在新德里举行的会谈发表评论说：“新德里的会谈将不仅是远东的和日内瓦会议的新的发展，同时还显示了一些很有趣的和突出的特点，从这些特点可以看出国际局势的发展，中国的国际重要性的日益提高以及亚洲国家不受外国干涉来决定自己的事务的日益强烈的愿望。”
      “红色权利报”强调指出：周恩来和尼赫鲁的会谈清楚地说明，通过和平协商和协议——不论协商国家的政治结构如何不同——来解决国际间问题的原则怎样在日益扩大的规模上被应用到国际生活中去。两位政治家的会谈也是垄断资本集团想孤立中华人民共和国、把它排斥于国际生活以外、组织一个不仅反对中国而且也反对以苏联为首的整个和平阵营的敌对国家阵线的阴谋的新的失败。
      “人民防线报”指出：周恩来访问印度首都比目前在华盛顿举行的美英会谈更引起世界报纸的注意，“这决不是偶然的”，因为“在华盛顿，美国政府正企图迫使英国代表在美国侵略政策的命令下投降，而中国和印度领导人物在新德里的会谈却是在讨论加强世界和平的方法的问题。”
    【新华社柏林二十九日电】柏林民主区各大报二十八日都以显著地位刊登我国周恩来总理和印度尼赫鲁总理会谈的消息。“每日评论报”在“中印友好——亚洲和平的保证”标题下刊登了周总理在记者招待会上的讲话及离新德里前的声明。“新德意志报”在“中印紧密合作”的大字标题下刊登了周总理与尼赫鲁总理会谈的联合声明全文。
     【新华社柏林二十九日电】西欧报纸日来都以显著地位刊载周恩来总理访问印度的消息。
    “汉堡人民报”在二十五日和二十六日刊载这个消息的标题中说，周恩来总理访问印度进一步巩固了中国和印度的友谊。
    比利时“红旗报”二十六日在首页刊载了印度人民热烈欢迎周恩来总理的消息。
    二十六日的意大利“团结报”和二十七日的丹麦“国土与人民报”也都以巨大篇幅刊载了周恩来总理访问印度的消息。
    【新华社日内瓦二十九日电】伦敦各报二十九日以显著地位刊载了中印两国总理二十八日在新德里发表的联合声明。“泰晤士报”在“德里会谈的主题——东南亚的和平”的标题下刊载了该报驻新德里记者的报道。报道说：“此间相信，这次访问对于亚洲关系可能产生深刻的影响。”“泰晤士报”在介绍了联合声明的要点——包括著名的五项原则之后说：“此间观察家很快就指出，似乎印度支那的停战和军事解决已被认为是当然的事了。经过同意的关于印度支那政治解决的目标也引起了很大的兴趣。”报纸指出：“‘印度斯坦时报’赞扬了五项原则，并且说，和这些原则相反，杜勒斯先生的东南亚防务建议，会使亚洲像欧洲一样分裂为敌对的体系，因而使冲突成为不可避免。”
      “新闻纪事报”在“周恩来和尼赫鲁号召和平”的标题下刊载了中印两国总理联合声明。报纸的社论援引了周恩来总理在二十六日尼赫鲁举行的宴会上致词中所说“外来的力量可以自由决定亚洲命运的时代已经过去了”这一句话。社论说，中印两国总理联合声明“尖锐地拒绝了外国干涉印度支那”。
    “工人日报”的社论说：“在中国和缅甸之间达成和新德里达成的协议相似的协议，将是对于
  ‘利用亚洲人打亚洲人’战略的又一次打击，并有助于印度支那的自由和东南亚的和平。”
    英国其他主要报纸也刊登了中印两国总理联合声明的主要内容和五项原则。
