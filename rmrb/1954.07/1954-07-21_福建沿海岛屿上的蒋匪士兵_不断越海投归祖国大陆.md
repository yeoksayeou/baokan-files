    Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 19th—Chiang Kai-shek remnant soldiers entrenched on the islands along the Fujian coast, such as Jinmen and Wuqiu Islands, are constantly crossing the sea to return to the motherland. Recently, He Caiyi, a soldier from the 223rd Regiment of the 75th Division of Chiang Kai-shek's Fifth Army, and Zhuang Jinyu, a member of the Chiang Kai-shek "Fujian Anti-Communist National Salvation Army" boat team, and fourteen others have successively crossed the sea to surrender to our coastal defense troops.
    Most of these Chiang Kai-shek soldiers who surrendered and returned were coastal fishermen and peddlers seized by Chiang Kai-shek when he fled the mainland. After being forcibly incorporated into the bandit army, they suffered oppression and pain. Homesickness became more and more intense, and they increasingly felt they were at the end of their rope. Therefore, whenever they had the opportunity, they disregarded the danger of being buried at sea or being beaten to death if they failed to escape, and holding onto door panels, wood, or toilets, they took advantage of the tide to float back to the mainland. After their return, they were treated kindly by the People's Liberation Army. The People's Liberation Army also provided them with travel expenses, pocket money, and daily necessities such as clothing and shoes, according to the distance of their journey home, to help them return to their hometowns and reunite with their families.

    福建沿海岛屿上的蒋匪士兵
    不断越海投归祖国大陆
    【新华社福州十九日电】盘踞在福建沿海金门、乌坵屿等岛上的残余蒋匪军士兵，不断越海投归祖国大陆。近来又有蒋匪第五军第七十五师二二三团的士兵何蔡宜和匪“福建反共救国军”船艇队队员庄金玉等十四人先后越海向我海防部队投诚。
    这些投诚归来的蒋匪军士兵，大部分都是蒋匪逃离大陆时抓去的沿海渔民和小贩。他们被强迫编入匪军后，受尽压迫和痛苦，思家心切，日益感到穷途末路，所以他们一有机会，就不顾有葬身鱼腹或逃跑不成遭打死等危险，抱着门板、木头或马桶等，趁着海潮飘回大陆。他们归来后，都受到人民解放军的宽待。人民解放军还按其归乡路程的远近，发给他们路费、零用钱和衣、鞋等日用品，帮助他们回乡和家人团聚。
