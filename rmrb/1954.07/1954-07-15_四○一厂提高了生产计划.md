Promote Technological Innovation to Increase Production Efficiency

    Factory 401 Improved Production Plan
    Factory 401 launched a mass technological innovation movement starting in March. More than ten major innovative suggestions that emerged during the movement solved key production problems and broke through various targets and quotas. For example, after implementing the Soviet advanced operating methods, the gas generation efficiency doubled, increasing the daily output of the furnace by more than 17%, exceeding the original plan; after the distillation furnace implemented "hot furnace repair" (repairing while hot without stopping the furnace), more than 180 furnace days can be added throughout the year. The technological innovation movement has continuously improved production efficiency, and the plans for March, April, and May were all fully and exceeded.
    The technological innovation movement caused the original plan to fall behind the actual production level. Under the conditions of supply and demand balance, Factory 401 revised its annual production plan: the total industrial output value increased by 23.5%, the cost decreased by 6.17%, the labor productivity increased by 27%, and the profit to be turned over increased from 22.8 billion yuan to 50.8 billion yuan, more than doubling the original plan.

专栏：开展技术革新运动提高生产效率

    四○一厂提高了生产计划
    四○一厂从三月起展开了群众性的技术革新运动。运动中出现的十多项重大革新建议，解决了生产关键问题，突破了各项指标、定额。如贯彻苏联先进操作方法后，煤气发生效率提高了一倍，使炉日产量提高百分之十七多，超过了原计划；蒸馏炉实行“热补炉”（不停炉趁热修理）以后，全年可多开一百八十多个炉日。技术革新运动使生产效率不断提高，三、四、五月份都全面、超额地完成了计划。
    技术革新运动，使原来的计划落在实际生产水平的后面。在供、销平衡条件下，四○一厂修订了全年生产计划：工业总产值提高了百分之二十三点五，成本降低百分之六点一七，劳动生产率提高了百分之二十七，上缴利润由二百二十八亿元增加到 五百零八亿元，比原计划提高一倍多。
