    Central Geological Department's 221st Comprehensive Exploration Team Strengthens Planning Management
    Drilling Footage and Core Sample Acquisition Rate Significantly Improved
    The 221st Team of the Central Geological Department is a large comprehensive exploration team. In June, it exceeded the drilling footage plan. The entire team has shown an unprecedented new look in production. The number of operating drilling rig months in June decreased by 5% compared to May, but drilling footage increased by 35.7% compared to May, the core sample acquisition rate increased by 4%, accidents have been greatly reduced compared to the past, and costs have decreased by 22.1%.
    Since the 221st Exploration Team began large-scale drilling work at the beginning of 1953, the completion of the plan has been very poor. The main reason is that management work has lagged behind the development of production, there is a relatively serious state of confusion in the work of the departments, and the grassroots production units do not have specific action plans, so that many drilling rigs are often in a state of "low efficiency, many accidents, high costs, and poor quality."
    In May, with the specific help of Soviet experts and leaders of the Ministry of Geology, the work of the departments was rectified, and planning management was promoted throughout the team, starting with mobilizing workers to formulate work plans, which began to change the past state of chaos. Now, at the end of the month, drilling rig workers can propose the drilling efficiency and core acquisition rate of each stratum for the next month based on the team's plan and the ideal columnar section diagram proposed by the geological department and past experience quotas, and specifically formulate daily plans for each drilling rig unit, and formulate a series of technical and safety measures to ensure the completion of the daily plan, and at the same time formulate the main material consumption quotas to complete the cost plan. After the implementation of the work plan in the drilling rigs, the workers have generally realized the benefits of the work plan to production. For example, worker Huang Xi said: "Having a work plan is like having eyes." The work of the departments can also propose its own work plan according to the compilation procedure of the team's drilling work plan.
    After the first half of the year's loyal and honest movement and labor protection card registration, the enthusiasm of the team's employees has been greatly improved. At the end of May, the staff representative meeting launched a "Four Comparisons Red Flag" competition throughout the team, comparing footage, quality, cost, and safety. At present, all the workers in the team are learning and discussing the draft constitution with joy and enthusiasm, and continue to carry out the "Four Comparisons Red Flag" competition, and strive to further complete the annual exploration task!

### 中央地质部二二一综合勘探队加强计划管理  钻探进尺和矿心采取率显著提高

    中央地质部二二一综合勘探队加强计划管理
    钻探进尺和矿心采取率显著提高
    中央地质部二二一队是一个巨大的综合勘探队，六月份超额完成了钻探进尺计划，全队在生产上出现了前所未有的新气象。六月份开动钻机的台月数比五月份减少百分之五，但钻探进尺比五月份提高了百分之三十五点七，矿心采取率提高了百分之四，事故比过去已大为减少，成本降低了百分之二十二点一。
    二二一勘探队自一九五三年年初开始大规模钻探工作后，完成计划的情况一直是很差的，主要原因是管理工作落后于生产发展，科室工作存在着较为严重的混乱现象，基层生产单位没有具体的行动计划，以致有不少钻机经常处于“效率低，事故多，成本高，质量差”的状态中。
    五月份经过苏联专家及地质部领导上的具体帮助，整顿了科室工作，并从发动工人制订作业计划着手在全队推行了计划管理，开始改变了过去的混乱状态。现在，钻机工人已能在月底根据队的计划和地质科提出的理想柱状剖面图及以往的经验定额，分别提出下一月每一地层的钻进效率和岩心采取率，具体地订出以钻机为单位的日计划，并为保证日计划的完成订出一系列的技术措施及安全措施，同时订出主要材料消耗定额，以完成成本计划。在钻机推行作业计划后，工人已普遍认识到作业计划对生产的好处，如工人黄玺说：“有了作业计划就像有了眼睛。”科室工作也能按全队钻探作业计划的编制程序提出自己的工作计划。
    全队职工经过上半年的忠诚老实运动及劳动保护卡片登记后，劳动热情已大为提高，五月底又通过职工代表会在全队范围内开展了以比进尺、比质量、比成本、比安全为内容的四比红旗竞赛。目前全队工人正以欢欣鼓舞的心情进行着宪法草案的学习和讨论，并继续开展四比红旗竞赛，为进一步完成全年的勘探任务而努力！　（徐政）
