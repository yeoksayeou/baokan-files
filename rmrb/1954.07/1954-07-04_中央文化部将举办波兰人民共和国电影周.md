To celebrate the tenth anniversary of Poland's National Rebirth Day and further promote cultural exchanges between China and Poland, the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government will hold a "Polish People's Republic Film Week."

The Film Week will begin on July 22nd, Poland's National Rebirth Day. The Polish feature films "The First Days," "The Last Stage," "The First Performance in Warsaw," "Chopin's Youth," and the documentary "Rebuilding Warsaw" will be screened in Beijing, Shenyang, Shanghai, Wuhan, Chongqing, Xi'an, Guangzhou, Tianjin, Nanjing, Harbin, Changchun, Chengdu, Anshan, Lushun-Dalian, Taiyuan, Jinan, Nanning, Hangzhou, Kunming, and Lanzhou.

"The First Days" depicts the struggle of the Polish working class in the early days of building their country. In 1945, after the liberation of Poland, workers in a certain iron factory, under the leadership of the Polish Workers' Party, reorganized the factory, fought against hidden special agents and bandits, restored production, and regularized production, producing a large amount of steel for the country. The protagonist of the film is an old worker. Under the education and cultivation of the Party, he improved his class consciousness, overcame his shortcomings, mastered leadership methods, and became a strong factory management cadre. The actor Tiegierzhiersiji, who played the old worker, profoundly created a convincing image, and therefore won the "Acting Award" at the 7th International Film Festival.

"The Last Stage" exposes the heinous crimes of the German fascist bandits who massacred peaceful people in the Auschwitz concentration camp in Poland during World War II; it shows how the captured peaceful people, under the leadership and organization of the Communist Party, bravely andresourcefully waged a heroic struggle against the German invaders, and how they persevered until they were liberated by the Soviet Red Army and gained freedom. The film truly recreates this historical period. The film was written and directed by Polish female writer and Stalin Prize winner Wanda Jakubowska, who personally experienced the suffering in the concentration camp. She received the International Peace Film Prize from the World Peace Council in 1950 for her achievements in making this film.

"The First Performance in Warsaw" describes the deeds of progressive artists in Poland under the rule of Tsarist Russia in the mid-19th century who struggled for national music and opera. Progressive artists, led by Huaski, waged an indomitable struggle to win the performance of the national opera "Halka" co-authored by Polish famous writer Menyushke and screenwriter Huaski, and finally overcame the multiple obstacles of the reactionary rule and won the victory of the first performance in Warsaw.

"Chopin's Youth" describes the struggle and musical creation life of Chopin, the world-famous Polish musician in the 19th century, in his youth. With his music full of national characteristics and revolutionary spirit, he encouraged the Polish revolutionary people in the struggle. When he performed abroad, his works were also widely spread throughout Europe. Chopin's works have been passed down to this day and have become treasures of Polish music and world music. The film has high achievements in shaping Chopin's image, introducing the source of his musical creation in his youth, and showing his approach to the people and participation in the revolutionary struggle. This film won the "Biography Film Award" at the 7th International Film Festival.

"Rebuilding Warsaw" is an excellent documentary film. It records the history of the destruction of the capital of People's Poland, the ancient city of Warsaw, by the enemy and the reconstruction of it by the people after liberation. While portraying this heroic city, the film solemnly reviews the history of the heroic Polish people's unyielding struggle against the enemy, and even more greatly praises the amazing speed and achievements of the Polish people in the construction of the capital.

    中央文化部将举办波兰人民共和国电影周
    为庆祝波兰国家复兴节十周年和进一步促进中、波两国间的文化交流，中央人民政府文化部即将举办“波兰人民共和国电影周”。
    电影周自七月二十二日波兰国家复兴节这天起，在北京、沈阳、上海、武汉、重庆、西安、广州、天津、南京、哈尔滨、长春、成都、鞍山、旅大、太原、济南、南宁、杭州、昆明、兰州等城市放映波兰的故事影片“最初的日子”、“最后阶段”、“华沙首次演出”、“萧邦的青年时代”，纪录影片“重建华沙”。
    “最初的日子”表现了波兰工人阶级在建设自己祖国最初的日子里的斗争。一九四五年，波兰解放后，某铁工厂工人，在波兰工人党的领导下，整顿工厂，和暗藏的特务匪徒作斗争，恢复了生产并使生产走向正规化，给祖国生产出大量钢铁。影片主人公是一个老工人。他在党的教育和培养下提高了阶级觉悟，克服了缺点，掌握了领导方法，成为一个坚强的工厂管理干部。扮演老工人的演员捷杰尔斯基深刻地创造了令人信服的形象，因此荣获第七届国际电影节“演技奖”。
    “最后阶段”揭露了第二次世界大战期间，德国法西斯匪徒，在设于波兰境内的奥斯威辛集中营中屠杀和平人民的滔天罪行；表现了被捕的和平人民在共产党的领导与组织下，勇敢机智地和德寇进行的英勇斗争，以及他们怎样坚持到被苏联红军解放获得自由。影片真实地再现了这一段史实。影片是由波兰女作家、斯大林奖金获得者万达·雅库鲍夫斯卡编导的，她曾亲身经历过集中营中的苦难岁月。她因摄制这部影片的成就得到了一九五零年世界和平理事会的国际和平电影奖金。
      “华沙首次演出”是描写十九世纪中叶，在帝俄沙皇统治下的波兰的进步艺术家们为民族音乐、歌剧而斗争的事迹。以华斯基为首的进步艺术家们，为争取波兰名作家孟纽什柯和编剧家华斯基合编的民族歌剧“哈卡”的演出，进行了不屈不挠的斗争，终于战胜了反动统治的多方阻难，得到在华沙首次演出的胜利。
      “萧邦的青年时代”描述了十九世纪世界著名的波兰音乐家萧邦青年时代的斗争生活和音乐创作生活。他以他富有民族特色和革命性的音乐，鼓舞了战斗中的波兰革命人民，他在国外演奏时，他的作品在欧洲各地也得到广泛的传播，萧邦的作品流传至今，成为波兰音乐、世界音乐的珍宝。影片对萧邦形象的塑造，和介绍他青年时代音乐创作的源泉以及表现他接近人民、参加革命斗争上，有着很高的成就。本片曾荣获第七届国际电影节“传记片奖”。
      “重建华沙”是一部优秀的文献纪录影片。它记录了人民波兰的首都、古老的华沙城遭到敌人的毁灭及解放后人民把它重建起来的史实。影片在表现这个英雄城市的同时，庄严地回顾了英雄的波兰人民对敌不屈的斗争历史，而更以极大的篇幅歌颂了波兰人民在建设首都的工程中的惊人速度和成就。　（新华社）
