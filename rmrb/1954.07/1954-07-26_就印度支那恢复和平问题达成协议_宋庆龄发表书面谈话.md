Millions of peace-loving Chinese people today join peace lovers around the world in rejoicing at the news of the Indochina armistice. This pleasing outcome of the Geneva Conference proves beyond doubt that international tensions can be eased and problems can be resolved through peaceful negotiation. This outcome demonstrates that peaceful coexistence is possible between countries as long as they respect each other's territorial integrity and sovereignty, rather than one country ruling and exploiting another. To strengthen and consolidate peace in Asia and the world, to improve the lives of the people, the principle of mutual respect and mutual assistance between countries can be established. The recent agreement signed between China and India has provided an encouraging example of what can be done in international relations. Instead of exchanging atomic secrets for the purpose of causing death and destruction to people, we have established the principle of building closer cultural relations and mutual assistance in order to improve the lives of the people of both countries. The first country to establish friendly diplomatic relations with us was the Soviet Union. This is the natural result of the long-standing friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples. It arises from their great sympathy for our national liberation struggle and our common desire to promote the peaceful construction of our two countries. The historically significant Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance signed by our two countries in February 1950 established an indestructible foundation for safeguarding peace and promoting human progress, which created a new condition for the affairs of the Far East and the world. The treaty also stipulates close economic cooperation and cultural exchanges, which have developed in the past five years and will continue to develop. In our cause of industrialization, the Soviet Union is giving generous and decisive assistance and inspiring our people with the example of the people's lives in a socialist society.

On the other hand, there are still other powerful elements in the world today who have adopted the opposite behavior from the beginning. Their relationship with us is: not allowing the traditional friendship between the people to continue to exist, but trying to change the natural path of history and creating hatred between their people and our people. They think they can disintegrate our young republic, so they try to implement blockades and aggression, and prevent the new China from obtaining its legitimate seat in international organizations established for the people of all countries. But history proves that these attempts have failed miserably and will continue to fail. Aggression has been repelled; the blockade has not only not hindered us, but on the contrary, has further promoted our self-reliance. Our representatives have participated in the most meaningful international conferences of this era, which is exactly its right. On every possible occasion, China's representatives have demonstrated their position in favor of peace, consultation, opposition to the use of force, and advocacy of the establishment of normal relations between countries. Just as Premier Zhou Enlai said at the Geneva Conference: "China's determination to handle its own affairs must be recognized and respected."

From the historically significant statements issued by China's Zhou Enlai, India's Nehru, and Burma's U Nu, it can be clearly seen that there are several principles that will guide the relations between our three countries and win the support of all people who desire peace and national independence. What could better confirm this shift in the situation than these two statements? While evil people are still using hydrogen bombs to threaten, peace-loving people all over the world must do everything in their power to promote reason and support all just demands for national independence for the peace and security of all people.

    就印度支那恢复和平问题达成协议
    宋庆龄发表书面谈话
    千百万热爱和平的中国人民今天和全世界的和平爱好者一同为印度支那停战的消息而欢欣。这个日内瓦会议底令人愉快的成果令人无可怀疑地证明：国际紧张局势能够缓和，各项问题能够通过和平协商来解决。这个成果表示：各国之间只要互相尊重领土完整与主权，而不是由一个国家统治与剥削另一个国家，和平共处便有可能。为了加强和巩固亚洲与世界的和平，为了提高人民的生活，各国之间互相尊重和互相帮助的原则是能够建立的。中国和印度最近签订的协定已为在国际关系上能够做些什么提供了一项令人鼓舞的范例。我们不是以促成人民的死亡与毁灭为目的而交换原子秘密，而是确定了建立起更加亲密的文化关系和互相帮助以便改善两国人民的生活的原则。首先和我们建立友好的外交关系的国家是苏联。这是中苏两国人民之间历史悠久的友谊的自然结果。是从他们对我们底民族解放斗争的伟大同情和我们促进我们两国的和平建设的共同愿望中产生的。一九五○年二月我们两国签订了富有历史意义的友好同盟互助条约，这个条约建立起一个保障和平、促进人类进步的不可摧毁的基础，这就为远东与世界的事务创造一项新的条件。这个条约也规定要进行紧密的经济合作与文化交流，这种经济合作与文化交流在过去五年已经发展，并将继续发展。在我国工业化的事业中，苏联正给予慷慨的、决定性的援助，并以社会主义社会的人民生活的范例来鼓舞我们的人民。另一方面，今天世界上还另有一些有势力的分子，他们从一开始起就采取着与此相反的行为。他们与我们的关系是：不让人民之间的传统友谊继续存在，而要企图改变历史底自然道路，在他们的人民和我们的人民之间制造仇恨。他们自以为能够使我们底年轻的共和国瓦解，因此就企图实行封锁和侵略，并且阻挠新中国在那些为一切国家人民而设立的国际机构中获得合法的席位。可是历史证明：这些企图已经悲惨地失败而且还要继续失败。侵略被击退了；封锁不仅没有阻碍，相反地只是更加促进了我们底自立。我们底代表已经参加了这个时代最有意义的国际性会议，这也正是他底权利。在每一个可能的场合下，中国的代表都表明了拥护和平、协商、反对诉诸于武力、和主张国际间建立正常关系的立场。正如同周恩来总理在日内瓦会议中所说的：“中国人民处理自己的事务的决心中须受到承认和尊重。”从中国的周恩来、印度的尼赫鲁和缅甸的吴努所发表的富有无限重大意义的历史性声明中，可以清楚地看出几项原则，这些原则将指导我们三国之间的关系，而且赢得它应该得到的一切企望和平与民族独立的人民底拥护。还有什么能比这两个声明更好地证实局势的这种转变吗？当万恶的人们还在利用氢弹进行威胁的今天，全世界爱好和平的人民为了所有人民底和平与安全，必须竭尽全力发扬理性，并支持一切争取民族独立的正义的要求。　（新华社）
