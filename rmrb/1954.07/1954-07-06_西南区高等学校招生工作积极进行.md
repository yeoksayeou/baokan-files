    Southwest Region's Institutions of Higher Learning Actively Carry Out Enrollment Work

    The enrollment work for institutions of higher learning in the Southwest Region is progressing actively. As of June 30th, the number of applicants who registered in the eight examination areas of Chongqing, Chengdu, Guiyang, and Kunming (excluding those registered collectively) totaled 4,223, including 1,429 cadres from government offices, exceeding the quota of cadres to be selected from the entire region. Party committees and administrative departments in various localities attach great importance to this year's enrollment work. The Propaganda Departments of the Sichuan and Xikang Provincial Party Committees and the responsible persons of the party and government in Nanchong, Neijiang and other places personally lead the local enrollment work. In order to ensure the comprehensive completion of the enrollment plan, many party and government departments actively select and send cadres to apply for the examinations. Even departments that have not been assigned tasks are proactively sending candidates. The number of cadres selected and sent by the Southwest Region and Chongqing municipal-level organizations alone has exceeded the original quota by more than two times. Leaders of Southwest-level organizations are reducing or stopping the work of cadres who have already applied for the exam, allowing them to review their lessons; some have even invited teachers to give them lectures.

    西南区高等学校招生工作积极进行
    西南区高等学校招生工作正积极进行。到六月三十日止，重庆、成都、贵阳、昆明等八个考区申请报名的考生（不包括集体报名者）共四千二百二十三人，其中机关干部一千四百二十九人，超过全区应选送的干部名额。各地党委和行政部门都很重视今年的招生工作，中共四川和西康省委宣传部及南充、内江等地党政负责人亲自领导当地招生工作。为了保证招生计划的全面完成，许多党政部门积极选送干部报考。未分配任务的机关，也主动选送。仅西南区和重庆市一级机关选送干部已超过原定名额两倍多。西南一级机关领导上并减少或停止已报考干部的工作，让他们复习功课；有的还请教师为他们讲课。
