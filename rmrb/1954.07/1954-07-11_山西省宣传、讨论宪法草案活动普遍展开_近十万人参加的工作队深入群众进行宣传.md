    Constitution Draft Propaganda and Discussion Activities Universally Unfolded in Shanxi Province
    Nearly 100,000 People Participating in Work Teams to Conduct Propaganda Deeply Among the Masses
    [Xinhua News Agency Dispatch] Propaganda and discussion activities for the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China have been widely launched in various parts of Shanxi Province. Work teams with nearly 100,000 participants are gradually going deeper into the masses to conduct propaganda. In Taiyuan City, more than 1,100 rapporteurs, propagandists, and some propaganda personnel from provincial-level organs have made their first reports to the masses in Taiyuan City, with over 60,000 listeners. In addition, more than 40,000 cadres and organized masses from all walks of life have begun discussing the draft constitution. Various street committees are using reading groups and blackboards to carry out propaganda among residents. In Datong City, rapporteurs and propagandists have made twelve reports to the masses, and propaganda tools such as blackboards and wired broadcasts have been utilized. Organizations such as the Datong Municipal Democratic Youth Federation have successively held symposiums for people from all walks of life, labor models, and activists to discuss the draft constitution. In Zhao City and other counties in the Linfen area, symposiums were also held for religious circles, business circles, and intellectuals. All localities are paying attention to closely integrating propaganda with production. In the rural areas of Taiyuan City, core groups and propaganda stations have been established at the township level to lead the propaganda and discussion in various townships, and rapporteurs are organized to go to the propaganda stations to impart knowledge.
    Before launching the propaganda and discussion of the draft constitution, Shanxi Province had trained and organized a propaganda team from top to bottom. The Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China transferred more than 1,100 cadres for short-term training. Tao Lujia, the first secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, made a report on the draft constitution and how to carry out propaganda and discussion. Various special districts and cities also transferred and trained more than 2,400 cadres. Counties and cities also trained about 80,000 propagandists by convening enlarged meetings of county, district, and township three-level cadres, concentrating township propagandists in the county for training, and having rapporteurs impart knowledge at transmission stations.

    近十万人参加的工作队深入群众进行宣传
    【新华社讯】山西省各地宣传和讨论中华人民共和国宪法草案的活动已普遍展开。近十万人参加的工作队正在逐步深入群众中进行宣传。太原市一千一百多名报告员、宣传员和省级机关的部分宣传人员，已在太原市向群众作了第一次报告，听众有六万多人。另外还有四万多名干部和各阶层有组织的群众已开始讨论宪法草案。各街道并利用读报组及黑板报等形式，向居民进行宣传。大同市的报告员和宣传员已向群众做过十二次报告，黑板报、有线广播等宣传工具都被利用起来。大同市民主青年联合会等团体都先后召开了各界人士和劳动模范、积极分子座谈会，讨论了宪法草案。临汾专区的赵城等县还召开了宗教界、工商界、知识分子等座谈会。各地在宣传中都注意和生产密切结合。太原市在市郊农村中，以乡为单位成立了核心小组和宣传站，领导各乡的宣传讨论，并组织报告员到宣传站进行传授。
    山西省在展开宪法草案的宣传讨论以前，曾自上而下地训练组织了一支宣传队伍。中共山西省委员会抽调一千一百多名干部进行了短期训练，省委第一书记陶鲁笳作了关于宪法草案及如何展开宣传讨论的报告。各专区、各市也抽调训练了干部两千四百多人。各县、市还通过召开县区乡三级干部扩大会议、把乡的宣传员集中到县训练以及报告员到传授站传授等办法，训练了宣传员约八万人。
