    Due to the earnest implementation of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party's "Decision on Guaranteeing the Completion of the 1954 National Higher Education Enrollment Plan" by Party organizations and People's Governments at and above the county level, and People's organizations, to systematically select and send young cadres to apply for higher education, the enthusiasm of on-the-job cadres in various regions for applying to higher education is very high, far exceeding the originally allocated quotas. As of July 5th, according to statistics from North China, Northeast China, Central South China, and Southwest China alone, the number of on-the-job cadres applying for higher education has reached 11,202, including 1,784 in North China, 4,009 in Northeast China, 3,249 in Central South China, and 2,160 in Southwest China.

    For cadres approved to apply, the original organs have reduced their workload and provided time for review and preparation. Where conditions permit, many organs have hired teachers to help cadres review according to the examination syllabus. For example, the Party Committee of the first-level organs in East China, since June 20th, has concentrated more than 600 cadres who have been approved to apply from five units: the Organization Department of the East China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, the Cultural and Educational Committee of the East China Administrative Council, the East China Textile Administration Bureau, the East China Office of the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry of the Central People's Government, and the Shanghai Customs, dividing them into arts and science groups for tutoring. The teachers in charge are borrowed from Jiaotong University, Tongji University, and East China Normal University, among other institutions.

    Most of the cadres who have been approved to apply have correctly chosen their university majors based on the needs of national construction, combined with their personal experience and expertise. Many of them have applied for majors in literature, history, politics, law, finance, and economics, which provides favorable conditions for ensuring the completion of the enrollment plans for these majors and appropriately improving the quality of admitted freshmen.

    各大区机关干部一万多人报考高等学校
    由于中国共产党县以上各级组织、县以上各级人民政府和人民团体切实贯彻中共中央“关于保证完成一九五四年全国高等学校招生计划的决定”，有计划地选送青年干部报考高等学校，各区在职干部报考高等学校的非常踊跃，远远超过原来分配的名额。截至七月五日止，仅据华北、东北、中南、西南四区统计，在职干部报考高等学校的已达一万一千二百零二人，其中华北区一千七百八十四人，东北区四千零九人，中南区三千二百四十九人，西南区二千一百六十人。
    对于被批准报考的干部，原机关都减轻了他们的工作，给予温课备考的时间。在条件许可的情况下，不少机关聘请教师，按照考试大纲，帮助干部复习。如华东一级机关党委会，自六月二十日起，就将被批准报考的干部六百多人，集中在中共中央华东局组织部、华东行政委员会文化教育委员会、华东纺织管理局、中央人民政府第一机械工业部华东办事处和上海海关五个单位，分文科组和理科组，进行补习。任课教员由交通大学、同济大学及华东师范大学等校借调。
    被批准报考的干部，大都根据国家建设需要，结合个人经历、专长正确地选择了升学志愿。他们中的很多人报考了文史、政法、财经一类的专业，这给保证这些专业招生计划的完成并适当提高录取新生质量，提供了有利的条件。
