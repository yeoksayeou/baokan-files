Silk is one of China's famous specialties with a long history. From the east coast of the motherland to the northwest plateau, from the rural areas of southern China to the banks of the Songhua River in the northeast, farmers everywhere engage in silkworm rearing as a sideline production. Especially in densely populated areas such as Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Guangdong, many farmers have long regarded silkworm rearing as their main source of income. In Zhejiang Province alone, there are nearly 600,000 silkworm farming households, with a mulberry garden area of more than 1.3 million mu.

Now, silk is not only woven into various colorful satins and brocades for people's clothing and apparel, but has also become a necessary raw material for the motherland's industrial construction.

Here is an introduction to Zhejiang silk.

    丝绸
    蚕丝是我国具有悠久历史的著名特产之一。从祖国的东海岸直到西北高原，从祖国南方的农村到东北松花江畔，到处都有农民把养蚕作为副业生产。特别是人口稠密的浙江、江苏和广东等地区，很多农民早把养蚕作为他们的主要收入。仅浙江一省就有近六十万户蚕农，桑园面积达一百三十多万亩。
    现在，蚕丝不仅织成各种色彩鲜艳的绸缎，供给人们衣着服饰之用，而且已成为祖国工业建设上所必需的原料。
  这里介绍的是浙江丝绸。
