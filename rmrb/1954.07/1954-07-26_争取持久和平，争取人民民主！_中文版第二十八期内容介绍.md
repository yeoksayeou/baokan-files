The organ of the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties, "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" Chinese Edition, Issue 28, has been published.

This issue features an editorial entitled "Raise the Ideological Level of Party Education." The editorial points out: The great power of Marxist-Leninist theory lies in the fact that it arms party members with knowledge of the laws of social development and class struggle, with the experience of revolutionary movements in various countries, enhances the political vigilance of party members, and strengthens the unity and combat effectiveness of the Party. Therefore, the Communist and Workers' Parties regard educating cadres and all party members with Marxism-Leninism as their primary task. To correctly lead socialist construction, party cadres and all party members must master Marxist-Leninist theory and be good at using this theory to solve political, economic, and cultural construction problems. Patiently and persistently educating party members from various social backgrounds with the principles of a Marxist-Leninist party is an important condition for further strengthening party unity and enhancing the vanguard role of party members in all aspects of life. The editorial continues: The issue of raising the ideological and theoretical level of party members is also one of the important tasks of the Communist and Workers' Parties in capitalist countries, colonies, and dependencies. To successfully complete the current major tasks, it is necessary to continuously improve the Marxist-Leninist cultivation of party members, especially the party's leadership core.

Important articles published in this issue include: "The People's Democratic System is the Most Important Tool for Building Socialism" by A. Čepička, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia; "The Bulgarian People are Confidently Marching Towards the Victory of Socialism" by G. Ganev, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party; and "The Indian Peasant Movement" by N. P. Rao, member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of India.

Čepička's article points out that the people's democratic system is a new form of the dictatorship of the proletariat, and its emergence and development show that, in addition to the Soviet system, it is also a tested form of social organization that guarantees the victorious conduct of socialist construction. Čepička then analyzes the development process of the Czechoslovak people's democratic system and its functions at various stages. Čepička said: Socialist construction is carried out under the condition of sharp class struggle on the economic, political, social, cultural, and ideological fronts. In a short historical period, the people's democratic system has shown that it is the fundamental factor for the people's creative ability to be brought into play, and it is indeed the main tool for striving to build socialism. Čepička concluded: Further improving and consolidating the people's democratic system and successfully playing its functions are a reliable guarantee for the final victory of socialism.

Ganev's article was written to commemorate the fifth anniversary of Dimitrov's death. The article describes Dimitrov's instructions, based on the experience of the Soviet Union, on building socialism in Bulgaria, as well as the great achievements Bulgaria has made in socialist construction. The article points out that Bulgaria has created the necessary conditions for the country to develop rapidly along the socialist road and greatly improve the material and cultural living standards of the working people.

专栏：

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”
    中文版第二十八期内容介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”一九五四年第二十八期中文版已经出版。
    本期以“提高党内教育的思想水平”为题发表社论。社论指出：马克思列宁主义理论之所以具有伟大的力量，是因为它以社会发展规律和阶级斗争的知识、以各国革命运动的经验武装党员，提高党员的政治警惕性，加强党的统一和战斗力。所以共产党和工人党认为用马克思列宁主义来教育干部和全体党员是自己的首要任务。要正确领导社会主义建设，党的干部和全体党员就必须掌握马克思列宁主义的理论，善于运用这种理论来解决政治、经济和文化建设问题。以马克思列宁主义政党的原则来耐心地、坚持不懈地对各种社会出身的党员进行教育，是进一步加强党的团结、提高党员在各方面生活中的先锋作用的重要条件。社论接着说：提高党员的思想水平和理论水平的问题也是资本主义国家、殖民地和附属国的共产党和工人党的重要工作之一。要胜利完成当前的重大任务，就必须不断地提高党员、首先是党的领导核心的马克思列宁主义修养。
    本期刊载的重要文章有：捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会政治局委员阿·契皮茨卡的“人民民主制度是建设社会主义的最重要的工具”，保加利亚共产党中央委员会书记处书记吉·加湼夫的“保加利亚人民满怀信心地走向社会主义的胜利”，印度共产党中央委员纳·普·拉奥的“印度农民运动”等。
    契皮茨卡的文章指出，人民民主制度是无产阶级专政的一种新的形式，它的产生和发展表明，除了苏维埃制度以外，它也是一种经过考验的保证胜利进行社会主义建设的社会组织形式。契皮茨卡接着分析了捷克斯洛伐克人民民主制度的发展过程及其在各个阶段中所发挥的功能。契皮茨卡说：社会主义建设是在经济、政治、社会、文化和思想等各个战线上展开尖锐的阶级斗争的情况下进行的。在短短的历史时期中，人民民主制度已经显示它是人民的创造能力得以发挥的根本因素，显示它的确是争取建成社会主义的主要工具。契皮茨卡最后说：进一步改进和巩固人民民主制度和胜利地发挥它的功能，是社会主义取得最后胜利的可靠保证。
    加湼夫的文章是为了纪念季米特洛夫逝世五周年而作的。文章叙述了季米特洛夫生前根据苏联的经验而提出的关于在保加利亚建设社会主义的指示以及保加利亚在社会主义建设中所取得的巨大成就。文章指出，保加利亚已经创造了必要条件，使国家可以沿着社会主义的道路迅速发展，大大提高劳动人民的物质和文化生活水平。　（新华社）
