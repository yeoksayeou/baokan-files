Jilin Chemical Plant Should Overcome Departmentalism and Actively Prepare to Promote Delivery Service

Readers Fan Zhongying, Zhao Bingqi, and others wrote: We are more than twenty dispatchers from various state-owned enterprises across the country, who came to the Jilin Chemical Plant to pick up goods in April. Some units were picking up very small quantities of goods, such as the Liaodong Chemical Plant in Shenyang, which was only picking up one barrel of calcium carbide (200 kilograms). They sent a special person to Jilin, and the cost of travel, transportation, and other expenses amounted to about 50% of the product price. Some units as far away as Gansu and Shanghai sent special personnel to travel thousands of miles to pick up goods, which was an even greater waste of manpower and financial resources.

Why is this happening? The reason is that the Jilin Chemical Plant has a departmentalist mentality and is unwilling to handle delivery for brother enterprises that order goods. This past March, when ordering goods in Beijing, we unanimously requested that the plant implement product delivery. At that time, they refused on the grounds that they lacked personnel and had transportation difficulties. However, after we arrived at the plant, we found that the actual situation was not like that. Currently, picking up goods at the plant requires going through three sections and six procedures. If the pick-up procedures were simplified, the manpower saved could completely handle delivery. As for transportation, there are no difficulties at all. Currently, when we pick up goods, the plant's loading and unloading team loads the trucks. When implementing delivery, it is only necessary to assign two or three people to regularly contact the transportation company and handle transportation procedures.

Not only does the plant refuse to implement delivery, but it also often fails to deliver goods on the dates specified in the contract, causing the dispatchers of the purchasing units to unnecessarily delay in Jilin for a long time. For example, Comrade Fang Zhen from a factory in Harbin came to the plant on April 1st to pick up goods, and as of the 14th, he had not yet received all of his order. This situation has caused some ordering units to suffer production losses because materials could not be delivered on time.

More than twenty of us unanimously feel that the plant's departmentalist mentality is quite serious. We earnestly hope that the plant will quickly change its work style, establish an overall concept, and find ways to implement product delivery, so as to prevent the continued waste of national funds and manpower, and to facilitate the work of brother factories and mines.

Editor's Note: The opinions raised by readers Fan Zhongying and others are correct. The leading cadres of the Jilin Chemical Plant lack an overall concept and do not recognize the importance of mutual cooperation and assistance between national enterprise units. Therefore, instead of actively finding ways to overcome difficulties to meet the demands of brother factories and mines regarding product delivery, they regard delivery work as "troublesome" and an "extra burden," and find various "reasons" and excuses to refuse it. According to our understanding, the Chemical Industry Administration Bureau of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry requested the plant in April to quickly find ways to promote delivery service, solve difficulties for ordering units, and save national manpower and material resources. However, the problem has not been resolved. After we contacted the Chemical Industry Administration Bureau, the Bureau further instructed the plant to conduct an inspection of this issue, overcome departmentalism, and establish an overall concept. In addition, it also requested the plant to quickly consult with the ordering departments to implement partial delivery as much as possible, and decided that all of the plant's calcium carbide would be delivered starting in the second half of the year.

### 吉林化工厂应克服本位思想积极准备推行代运送货工作

专栏：读者来信摘要

    吉林化工厂应克服本位思想积极准备推行代运送货工作
    读者樊忠英、赵炳麒等来信：我们是各地国营企业单位的二十多个调拨员，在四月份先后到吉林化工厂来提货。有些单位所提货物数量很少，如沈阳辽东化学厂只是提取一桶电石（二百公斤），派了一个专人到吉林来，路费、运费及其他开支就达产品价格的百分之五十左右。有些远在甘肃、上海等地的单位，派专人跋涉千里来提货，人力、财力的浪费就更大了。
    为什么会出现这种现象呢？原因是吉林化工厂有本位主义思想，不愿替订货的兄弟企业办理代运。今年三月在北京订货时，我们曾一致要求该厂实行产品代运。当时，他们用人员不足、运输上有困难等作理由而拒绝了。但我们到达该厂后，发现实际情况并不是那样。现在我们在该厂提一次货要经过三个科、六道手续；如果提货手续简化一些，节省出人力来办理代运是完全可以的。至于运输问题更是没有什么困难。现在我们取货时都是由该厂装卸队装车；实行代运时只要抽出两三个人经常和运输公司联系，办理运输手续就行了。
    该厂不但拒绝实行代运，而且常常不能按合同规定的日期交货，使取货单位的调拨员不必要地在吉林耽搁很长时间。如哈尔滨某厂方振同志在四月一日到该厂来提货，一直等到十四日还没拿到全部订货。这种情况，已使某些订货单位因材料不能按时运到而生产受到损失。
    我们二十多人一致感到该厂本位主义思想是相当严重的。我们恳切地希望该厂迅速改变作风，树立整体观念，设法实行产品代运，以免国家资金和人力继续遭受浪费，并便利兄弟厂矿的工作。
    编者按：读者樊忠英等来信所提的意见是正确的。吉林化工厂的领导干部缺乏整体观念，不认识国家企业单位之间互相配合、协助的重要性，因此，他们不是积极设法克服困难来满足兄弟厂矿关于产品实行代运的要求；相反地却把代运工作看作是“麻烦事”和“额外负担”，而找各种“理由”和借口来加以拒绝。据我们了解，中央重工业部化学工业管理局在四月份曾要求该厂迅速设法推行代运送货工作，为订货单位解决困难，为国家节省人力、物力。但是问题并没有解决。经我们和化学工业管理局联系，化学工业管理局又指示该厂对这个问题进行检查，克服本位主义思想，树立整体观念；此外，还要求该厂迅速与订货部门协商，尽可能实行部分代运，并决定下半年起该厂的电石全部实行代运送货。
