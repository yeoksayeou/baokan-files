Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 14th: The Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea held an award ceremony on the 13th, awarding various medals and Meritorious Service Medals to 126 commanders and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army engineering units and nine Chinese Aid-Korea workers who had performed meritorious service in the restoration project of the Daedong Bridge (i.e., the Daedong River pedestrian iron bridge) in Pyongyang.

Kim Tu-bong, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea, presided over the award ceremony. In his congratulatory speech, Kim Tu-bong highly praised the spirit of internationalism shown by the Volunteer Army engineering units and the Chinese Aid-Korea workers who participated in the Daedong Bridge restoration project, as well as their efforts to overcome difficulties, complete the task one month ahead of schedule, and save a large amount of materials.

Among the award recipients, Gao Xufu, a soldier of the Volunteer Army engineering unit, was awarded the First-Class Soldier's Honor Medal for improving technology in the work of binding steel bars, increasing work efficiency by six to eleven times. Sun Xiwu, a Chinese Aid-Korea worker who received the Second-Class National Flag Medal, used his spare time over more than a month to create more than 30 types (more than 1,000 pieces) of tools and iron materials to supply the needs of the project. Hu Bengui, a Chinese Aid-Korea stonemason who received the Third-Class National Flag Medal, put forward a rationalization proposal that reduced the manpower required for a project that originally needed more than 1,500 workers to only 430 workers. In addition, three soldiers of the Volunteer Army engineering unit were awarded the Second-Class Soldier's Honor Medal, and the others were awarded Meritorious Service Medals.

Note: The Daedong River pedestrian iron bridge, connecting the Central District and the Eastern District of Pyongyang, is 620 meters long and spans the Daedong River together with the Daedong River Railway Grand Iron Bridge, is one of the largest pedestrian iron bridges in northern Korea. During the war, the iron bridge was severely damaged. After the armistice, the Korean and Chinese engineering units overcame numerous difficulties and, after seven months of intense labor, completed the restoration project one month ahead of schedule, saving more than 60,000 man-days and materials worth more than 32 million won (Korean currency).

    赞扬他们在平壤市大同桥恢复工程中的功勋
    【新华社平壤十四日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议常任委员会在十三日举行授勋大会，将各种勋章和功劳奖章，授予在平壤市大同桥（即大同江人行铁桥）恢复工程中建立功勋的一百二十六名中国人民志愿军工兵部队的指挥员、战斗员和九名中国援朝工人。
    朝鲜最高人民会议常任委员会委员长金枓奉主持授勋。金枓奉在致祝词时，对参加大同桥恢复工程的志愿军工兵部队和中国援朝工人高度的国际主义精神和克服困难、提前一个月完成任务、并节省了大量资材的事迹，予以高度的赞扬。
    在受勋的人员中，一级战士荣誉勋章获得者志愿军工兵部队战士高绪福，在编扎钢筋的工作中改进了技术，使工作效率提高了六倍到十一倍。二级国旗勋章获得者中国援朝工人孙喜武，在一个多月中利用工余时间打造了三十多种（共一千多件）工具和铁材，供应工程的需要。三级国旗勋章获得者中国援朝石工胡本贵，提出了合理化建议使原来需要一千五百多个人工才能完成的工程，只用了四百三十多个人工就完成。另外，有三位志愿军工兵部队战士获得了二级战士荣誉勋章，其他人都获得了功劳奖章。
    注：连结平壤市中区和东区的大同江人行铁桥长达六百二十公尺，和大同江铁道大铁桥双双横跨在大同江上，是朝鲜北部最大的人行铁桥之一。战时这座铁桥受到严重的破坏，停战以后，朝、中工兵部队克服了重重的困难，经过七个月的紧张劳动，提前一个月完成了修复工程，并节省了六万多个人工和价值三千二百多万元（朝鲜币）的资材。
