    The Great Communist - Georgi Dimitrov Lives Forever in the Hearts of the People
    Wu Yuzhang, Member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
    Five years ago today, Georgi Dimitrov, an outstanding activist of the international working-class movement and the great leader of the Bulgarian people, passed away. Dimitrov's death was a major loss to the world communist movement and the cause of the struggle for peace and democracy of the peoples of all countries. Today, the Chinese people and working people all over the world commemorate this great and ardent fighter for the victory of communism with deep respect and sorrow.
    Dimitrov's name is inextricably linked with the development of the modern international working-class movement and the Bulgarian people's struggle for liberation, freedom, and happiness. Dimitrov dedicated his entire life and all his energy unreservedly to the cause of the working class. As Comrade Chervenkov said, "He had no interests other than the interests of the people; he had no life other than a life of struggle for the victory of the Party, the working class, and socialism." Dimitrov made outstanding contributions to the cause of the world's working people in their struggle for self-liberation and the victory of socialism through his outstanding activities throughout his life.
    Dimitrov participated in the revolutionary movement from the age of fifteen. Because of his selfless struggle and spirit of sacrifice, he quickly gained the trust and love of revolutionary workers and became one of the leaders of the Bulgarian workers' movement. At the age of eighteen, he was elected secretary of the Sofia Printing Workers' Union. In 1902, he joined the revolutionary faction of the Bulgarian Social Democratic Party led by Blagoev and became a Marxist. From 1905 to 1923, Dimitrov was the leader of the Bulgarian General Trade Union. In September 1923, Dimitrov and his close comrade Kolarov led an armed uprising against the Bulgarian fascist rule. After the failure of the uprising, Dimitrov was forced to move abroad. After that, Dimitrov's main activity was to engage in the international working-class movement. He actively participated in the work of the Executive Committee of the Communist International and became one of the organizers of the international anti-fascist struggle.
    In 1933, Dimitrov was arrested in Berlin for carrying out revolutionary activities. The Hitler fascist gang fabricated the so-called crime of instigating arson to burn down the German Reichstag and interrogated Dimitrov in Leipzig. But during the trial, Dimitrov ruthlessly exposed the hideous face and ugly essence of fascism in front of the whole world, and changed from a defendant to a severe accuser of fascism. Dimitrov defended the justice and dignity of mankind, defended the cause of the working class and the glory of communist fighters with heroic actions, thus setting a glorious example for the revolutionary fighters of the international working class that will never be erased. Due to the protests of the working people all over the world and the actions taken by the Soviet Union, Dimitrov's struggle finally won victory and he regained his freedom.
    In 1935, Dimitrov was elected Secretary-General of the Executive Committee of the Communist International. In order to strive for the establishment and consolidation of the united front of the working class and the masses of the people against fascism, Dimitrov carried out tremendous political and organizational work.
    In his report at the Seventh Congress of the Communist International, he brilliantly expounded the importance of the united front of the working class against fascism, the content and form of the united front, how to establish a broad anti-fascist people's front on the basis of the united front of the working class, and the strategic issues of the united front in various countries, and became the guiding principle for the practical struggle of the working class in various countries.
    In this report, Dimitrov also specifically discussed the united front of the Chinese people against Japanese imperialism, which was initiated and led by the Chinese Communist Party at that time. He said: "...We endorse the initiative of our heroic Chinese brother Party to unite all organized forces in China who are willing to truly fight for national salvation and people's liberation to establish a very broad united front against Japanese imperialism and its Chinese agents." Dimitrov paid tribute to the revolutionary people of China at the meeting on behalf of the revolutionary proletariat of the world. He said: "We dare to assure the Chinese people that we will resolutely support the Chinese people's struggle to completely liberate themselves from all imperialist robbers and their Chinese lackeys." This shows that Dimitrov has always been very concerned about and has given continuous support to the Chinese revolution.
    During his leadership of the Communist International, Dimitrov provided ideological guidance to the international working-class movement in many ways. The Bolshevization of the Bulgarian Communist Party and the overcoming of the non-Bolshevik remnants of the Communist Parties of many countries are inseparable from the efforts of Comrade Dimitrov. He was very concerned about the cause of establishing and training strong Bolshevik cadres for the Communist Parties of various countries. He believed that tirelessly studying the theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, and creatively applying Marxism-Leninism in combination with different specific circumstances, was an urgent task of the Communist Parties of various countries. He said: "For the Communist Parties of various countries, for the fighting vanguard of the working class, constantly studying and understanding Marxism-Leninism is as necessary as bread, air, and water. The attitude of belittling theory and the tendency of empiricism must be ended as soon as possible." The famous principles determined by Comrade Dimitrov in terms of cadre policy and cadre education are well known to Communists in various countries.
    Dimitrov strongly emphasized the importance of educating the working class and the working people with the spirit of proletarian internationalism. He believed that: "Educating workers and all working people with the spirit of proletarian internationalism is one of the basic tasks of the Communist Parties of various countries." "There can be no true people's patriotism without international solidarity, just as there can be no true international solidarity without true people's patriotism."
    Dimitrov was a loyal friend of the Soviet Union. He called on the Communist Parties of all countries and progressive people all over the world to unite around the powerful fortress of socialism—the Soviet Union. He believed that the touchstone for determining who is a friend or enemy of the working class and the cause of socialism, and who is a supporter or opponent of democracy and peace, is his attitude towards the Soviet Union, and the standard for measuring proletarian internationalism is also the attitude adopted towards the Soviet Union.
    After the outbreak of World War II, Dimitrov led the Bulgarian people in an armed struggle against fascism, and called on the Communists of all countries to mobilize and lead all progressive forces in the struggle against the fascist aggressors. Because of his outstanding contributions to leading the anti-fascist struggle, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union awarded him the Order of Lenin in 1945.
    On September 9, 1944, under the influence of the victorious advance of the Soviet Union, the Bulgarian people held an armed uprising and overthrew the fascist regime, thus opening a new stage in Bulgarian history. In November 1945, after spending twenty-two years in exile abroad, Dimitrov returned to his homeland. He personally led the Bulgarian people in clearing the remnants of fascism at home, opposing the bourgeois offensive, restoring the national economy, implementing social and democratic reforms, and consolidating the people's power, and led the drafting of Bulgaria's first five-year plan. At the Fifth Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party held in December 1948, Dimitrov put forward the task of building socialism in Bulgaria and pointed out the road to socialist development. In his brilliant report, Dimitrov, with the theory of Marxism-Leninism, combined the actual conditions of Bulgaria and other liberated Southeast European countries, and demonstrated the essence of the people's democratic system as one of the forms of the dictatorship of the proletariat. He pointed out that the people's democratic system "exercises the functions of the dictatorship of the proletariat for the interests of the vast majority of the working people, and realizes the broadest and most thorough democracy—socialist democracy." He also pointed out that Bulgaria and the people's democratic countries "must thoroughly study and widely apply the great experience of Soviet socialist construction." Dimitrov elaborated in his report the theoretical issues of the nature, role, tasks, and development prospects of the people's democratic countries that emerged in the new historical situation.
    In the years after World War II, Dimitrov continued to spare no effort to expose the new aggressive conspiracies of the imperialists and called on the people of all countries to take action to thwart the evil plans of the instigators of the new war. Dimitrov pointed out: "After the collapse of the fascist aggressors, the core of the world's reactionary forces has shifted to the United States. The American imperialists' plan to dominate the world has replaced Hitler's plan to enslave the world, which was miserably defeated in the last war." He believed that due to the unsolvable and increasingly serious contradictions contained in the capitalist system itself, the rapid growth of the world's peace and democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union, and the people of all countries' desire to safeguard peace, the strength of imperialism will inevitably weaken day by day, "The plans of the aggressors and instigators of the new war are doomed to failure." Dimitrov's analysis is correct. Today, the cause of defending peace is in the hands of the powerful world peace and democratic forces headed by the Soviet Union, and in the hands of the forces defending peace in all countries of the world, and the US imperialists' plan to launch a new world war is constantly being frustrated.
    Dimitrov was the organizer of the Bulgarian people's victory and the founder of the People's Republic of Bulgaria. Under his leadership, the Bulgarian people began the struggle to build a new life and achieved brilliant victories. When the Bulgarian people needed him to lead them wisely to achieve greater victories, the disease took his precious life. This is an irreparable loss for the Bulgarian people. But as Comrade Chervenkov said: The Bulgarian people "transformed the deep mourning for the loss of their leader into a hundredfold stronger spiritual and political unity. ... They strengthened their unwavering will to carry out Dimitrov's immortal cause and move towards complete victory."
    Under the guidance of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party and Comrade Chervenkov, the Bulgarian people have completed the first five-year plan one year ahead of schedule. In 1953, the total value of industrial production had increased to more than 2.4 times that of 1948 or more than 4.7 times that of the pre-war period. Heavy industry has developed greatly. Socialist ownership has occupied an absolute dominant position in the entire industrial sector. The cause of socialist transformation of agriculture is also making rapid progress. The cultivated land area of agricultural production cooperatives has accounted for more than 60% of the total cultivated land area of the country, and two-thirds of the country's grain supply comes from the socialist components of agriculture. In the past few years, the Bulgarian Communist Party has developed stronger and become more consolidated in leading the people in the struggle to build socialism. The Sixth Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party held in February-March this year is a clear proof of the strong unity of the Bulgarian Communist Party ranks. The congress summarized the great achievements of the Bulgarian people in the past and adopted the draft guidelines for the second five-year plan for the development of the national economy. Under the leadership of the Bulgarian Communist Party, the Bulgarian people are advancing towards new victories.
    Comrade Dimitrov has left us. But his shining example and precious teachings will forever remain in the hearts of the working people all over the world. Today, on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of the death of Comrade Dimitrov, we must learn from his infinite loyalty and love for the cause of the working class, learn from his uncompromising fighting spirit against class enemies, learn from his selfless and noble communist qualities, and continue to advance the great cause for which Dimitrov devoted his life to unselfishly.

    伟大的共产主义者——季米特洛夫永远活在人民心里
    中国共产党中央委员会委员  吴玉章
    五年前的今天，国际工人阶级运动的杰出活动家、保加利亚人民的伟大领袖格奥尔基·季米特洛夫与世长辞了。季米特洛夫的逝世，是世界共产主义运动和各国人民争取和平民主斗争事业的重大损失。中国人民和全世界劳动人民今天怀着深切的敬爱和沉痛的心情，来纪念这位伟大的争取共产主义胜利的热情斗士。
    季米特洛夫的名字，和现代国际工人阶级运动的发展，和保加利亚人民争取解放、自由、幸福的斗争，是不可分割地联系在一起的。季米特洛夫把自己的整个生命和全部精力，毫无保留地贡献给工人阶级的事业。正如契尔文科夫同志所说的：“他除了人民的利益以外，没有任何别的利益；他除了为党、为工人阶级、为社会主义的胜利斗争的生命以外，没有别的生命。”季米特洛夫以自己一生的杰出活动，对世界劳动人民争取自身解放与社会主义胜利的事业作出了卓越的贡献。
    季米特洛夫从十五岁起就参加了革命运动。由于他的忘我斗争和牺牲精神，他很快地获得了革命工人的信任与爱戴，成为保加利亚工人运动的领导人之一。十八岁的时候，他就被选为索非亚的印刷工人工会书记。一九○二年，他参加了以布拉戈耶夫为首的保加利亚社会民主党的革命派，而成为一个马克思主义者。从一九○五年到一九二三年，季米特洛夫一直是保加利亚总工会的领导者。一九二三年九月，季米特洛夫和他的亲密战友科拉罗夫领导了反对保加利亚法西斯统治的武装起义。起义失败后，季米特洛夫被迫移居国外。这以后，季米特洛夫的主要活动是从事国际工人阶级运动。他积极地参加了共产国际执行委员会的工作，并成为国际反法西斯斗争的组织者之一。
    一九三三年，季米特洛夫因进行革命活动而在柏林被捕。希特勒法西斯匪帮捏造了所谓指使纵火焚烧德国国会的罪名，在来比锡对季米特洛夫进行了审讯。但是在审讯期间，季米特洛夫在全世界面前无情地揭穿了法西斯主义的狰狞面貌及其丑恶本质，而从一个被告人变成为对法西斯主义的严厉的控诉者。季米特洛夫以英勇的行动保卫了人类的正义和尊严，保卫了工人阶级的事业和共产主义战士的光荣，从而为国际工人阶级的革命战士树立了永远不可磨灭的光辉榜样。由于全世界劳动人民的抗议和苏联所采取的行动，季米特洛夫的斗争终于获得胜利而恢复了自由。
    一九三五年，季米特洛夫被选为共产国际执行委员会的总书记。为了争取建立与巩固工人阶级和人民大众反法西斯主义的统一战线，季米特洛夫进行了巨大的政治和组织工作。
    他在共产国际第七次代表大会上的报告中，对工人阶级反法西斯统一战线的重要性、统一战线的内容和形式、如何在工人阶级统一战线的基础上建立广泛的反法西斯人民战线，以及各个国家内的统一战线等策略问题，作了光辉的阐明，而成为各国工人阶级进行实际斗争的指导方针。
    季米特洛夫在这个报告中，还特别论述到了当时由中国共产党所发起和领导的中国人民反对日本帝国主义的统一战线。他说：“……我们赞成我们英勇的中国兄弟党的创议，即联合中国境内所有那些愿意为救国救民而真正斗争的有组织的队伍，来建立一个反对日本帝国主义及其中国代理人的非常广泛的统一战线。”季米特洛夫在会上代表全世界革命无产阶级向中国革命人民致敬。他说：“我们敢对中国人民保证，我们要坚决地支持中国人民争取从一切帝国主义强盗及其中国走狗那里完全解放出来的斗争。”这表明，季米特洛夫对于中国革命一直是十分关怀并给予不断支持的。
    在担任共产国际的领导工作期间，季米特洛夫在许多方面给国际工人阶级运动以思想指导。保加利亚共产党的布尔什维克化和许多国家共产党的非布尔什维克的残余的克服，和季米特洛夫同志的努力是分不开的。他非常关心各国共产党的建立和培养坚强的布尔什维克干部的事业。他认为不倦地学习马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的学说，结合不同的具体情况而创造性地运用马克思列宁主义，是各国共产党的迫切任务。他说：“对于各国共产党，对于工人阶级的战斗的先锋队来说，经常地学习和通晓马克思列宁主义，像面包、空气和水一样需要。轻视理论的态度，经验主义的倾向，必须尽快地结束。”季米特洛夫同志在干部政策和干部教育方面所确定的著名原则，是各国共产党人所熟知的。
    季米特洛夫十分强调以无产阶级国际主义精神教育工人阶级和劳动人民的重要性。他认为：“以无产阶级的国际主义精神教育工人和一切劳动人民，是各国共产党的基本任务之一。”“没有国际的团结就不能有真正的人民的爱国主义，正如没有真正的人民的爱国主义就不能有真正的国际主义团结
  一样。”
    季米特洛夫是苏联的忠实朋友。他号召各国共产党和全世界进步人士团结在社会主义的强大堡垒——苏联的周围。他认为，断定谁是工人阶级和社会主义事业的朋友或敌人，断定谁是民主与和平的拥护者或反对者的试金石，就是他对苏联的态度，衡量无产阶级国际主义的标准，也就是对苏联所采取的态度。
    第二次世界大战爆发以后，季米特洛夫领导保加利亚人民进行反法西斯的武装斗争，并号召各国共产党人动员和领导一切进步力量进行反对法西斯侵略者的斗争。由于他在领导反法西斯斗争中的卓越贡献，苏联最高苏维埃主席团曾在一九四五年授予他以列宁勋章。
    一九四四年九月九日，保加利亚人民在苏联胜利进军的影响下举行了武装起义，推翻了法西斯政权，从而开辟了保加利亚历史的新阶段。一九四五年十一月，季米特洛夫在度过了二十二年的国外流亡生活之后，重新回到了自己的国土。他亲自领导了保加利亚人民肃清国内法西斯主义残余，反对资产阶级进攻，恢复国民经济，实行社会民主改革和巩固人民政权的工作，并领导了保加利亚第一个五年计划的拟订工作。在一九四八年十二月举行的保共第五次代表大会上，季米特洛夫提出了在保加利亚建设社会主义的任务，并指出了向社会主义发展的道路。在他的光辉的报告中，季米特洛夫以马克思列宁主义的理论结合着保加利亚和其他获得解放的东南欧国家的实际情况，论证了作为无产阶级专政形式之一的人民民主制度的本质。他指出人民民主制度“是为了绝大多数劳动人民的利益而执行无产阶级专政的职权，并实现最广泛的、最彻底的民主——社会主义的民主”。他并且指出，保加利亚和各人民民主国家“必须彻底研究和广泛应用苏联社会主义建设的伟大经验”。季米特洛夫就在自己的报告中阐明了在新的历史情况下出现的人民民主国家的性质、作用、任务及其发展前途的理论问题。
    在第二次世界大战以后的年月里，季米特洛夫继续不遗余力地揭露帝国主义者的新的侵略阴谋，并号召各国人民行动起来挫败新战争挑拨者的罪恶计划。季米特洛夫指出：“法西斯侵略者溃灭以后，世界反动势力的核心移到了美国。美帝国主义者统治世界的计划，代替了在上次大战中惨遭失败的希特勒的奴役世界的计划。”他认为，由于资本主义制度本身所包含的无法解决并日益严重的矛盾，由于以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营力量的迅速壮大，和各国人民维护和平的热望，帝国主义的力量是必然会日趋削弱的，“侵略者和新战争挑拨者的那些计划，是注定要失败的。”季米特洛夫的分析是正确的。今天保卫和平的事业已掌握在强大的、以苏联为首的世界和平民主力量的手里，掌握在世界各国保卫和平的力量手里，美帝国主义企图发动新的世界战争的计划正在不断地遭受着挫败。
    季米特洛夫是保加利亚人民胜利的组织者和保加利亚人民共和国的缔造者。在他的领导之下，保加利亚人民开始了建设新生活的斗争，取得了光辉的胜利。当保加利亚人民正需要他英明地领导他们取得更大的胜利的时候，病魔却夺走了他的宝贵的生命。这是保加利亚人民无可弥补的损失。但是正如契尔文科夫同志所说的：保加利亚人民“把丧失领袖的深切的哀悼化为百倍坚强的精神上和政治上的团结。……他们加强了坚定不移的意志，贯彻季米特洛夫的不朽事业，走向完全的胜利”。
    在保加利亚共产党中央和契尔文科夫同志的领导之下，保加利亚人民已提前一年完成了第一个五年计划。而一九五三年工业生产总值已增加到一九四八年的二点四倍以上或战前的四点七倍以上。重工业大大地发展了。社会主义所有制已在整个工业部门中占有绝对统治地位。对农业进行社会主义改造的事业也有着迅速的进展。农业生产合作社的耕地面积已占全国耕地总面积的百分之六十以上，国家所得的粮食供应有三分之二取自农业的社会主义成分。这几年来，保加利亚共产党在领导人民建设社会主义的斗争中发展得更加强大，团结得更加巩固了。今年二—三月间举行的保加利亚共产党第六次代表大会，是保加利亚共产党队伍坚强的团结统一的明证。大会总结了保加利亚人民过去的伟大成就并通过了关于发展国民经济的第二个五年计划的指示草案。在保加利亚共产党的领导之下，保加利亚人民正在向新的胜利前进着。
    季米特洛夫同志是离开我们了。但是他的光辉的榜样和宝贵的教言，却永远留在全世界劳动人民的心里。在今天纪念季米特洛夫同志逝世五周年的时候，我们要学习他对于工人阶级事业的无限忠诚和热爱，学习他对阶级敌人的毫不妥协的斗争精神，学习他的大公无私的崇高的共产主义品质，要把季米特洛夫毕生为之忘我奋斗的伟大事业继续推向前进。
