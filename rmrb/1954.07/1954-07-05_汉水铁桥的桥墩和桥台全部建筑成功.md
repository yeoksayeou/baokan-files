Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 2nd. All the bridge piers and abutments of the Hanshui Iron Bridge were successfully completed on the morning of July 1st. The engineering quality generally met the design standards. Now, standing on the newly built roadbed of the Hanshui Bridgehead Railway Connection Line, one can see a row of grayish-white bridge piers standing in the turbulent flow of the Hanshui River from the Hankou bank to the Hanyang bank. On several bridge piers, workers and railway soldiers are still dismantling the model boards of the bridge piers, whose concrete has already solidified, at high altitudes. The steel beam riveting work is proceeding intensely. In order to erect the steel beams, two huge silver-gray plate beams have already been erected between the No. 1, 2, and 3 bridge piers. The preliminary outline of a new iron bridge that is about to be completed has already been formed.

The most difficult part of bridge construction is the substructure. The completion of this part of the project means that the entire bridge project has achieved a decisive victory. The substructure projects of the Hanshui Iron Bridge, such as bridge abutments and bridge piers, involved complex underwater work such as pile driving, cofferdam construction, and drainage, as well as the pouring of large amounts of concrete. Throughout the entire construction process, all the employees and railway soldiers on the entire site enthusiastically persisted in their work day and night. The workers pouring concrete worked at a height of nearly thirty meters, braving the summer heat; sometimes, when it suddenly rained heavily, many workers took off their raincoats and covered the concrete to protect the quality of the concrete from damage. The carpenters tripled their efficiency in making model boards, and the number of labor hours required to erect one section of the model was reduced from 80 to more than 30, finally completing the production and installation tasks of all the bridge pier model boards as scheduled. On many windy and rainy days, the electric welding sparks still flashed day and night in the workshops of the electromechanical work area, processing various steel bar materials for the construction of bridge piers. The staff in the health station, cafeteria, and other departments also took turns supporting the project day and night in three shifts.

    汉水铁桥的桥墩和桥台全部建筑成功
    【新华社武汉二日电】汉水铁桥的桥墩和桥台，已在七月一日上午全部建筑成功，工程质量一般都达到了设计标准。现在，站在新修成的汉水桥头铁路联络线的路基上，可以看到从汉口岸到汉阳岸，一排灰白色的桥墩屹立在汉水的激流中。在几个桥墩上，工人和铁道兵战士还在高空拆除那混凝土已经凝固了的桥墩的模型板。钢梁拼铆工作正在紧张进行。为了架设钢梁，在一、二、三号桥墩之间并且已经架好了两孔巨大的银灰色的钣梁。一座快要建成的新铁桥的初步轮廓已经构成了。
    桥梁建筑工程最艰难的是下部结构，这部分工程的完成，就意味着整个桥梁工程已取得决定性的胜利。汉水铁桥的桥台和桥墩等下部工程，除打桩、建立围堰、排水等复杂的水下工作外，还浇灌了大量的混凝土。整个施工过程中，全工地的职工和铁道兵战士们，不分白天黑夜热情地坚持着工作。浇灌混凝土的工人们，冒着夏天的炎热，在近三十公尺的高空工作；有时突然天降大雨，很多工人把自己的雨衣脱下来盖在混凝土上，以保护混凝土的质量不受损害。木工们作模型板的效率提高三倍，立一节模型所用的工数也由八十个工减少到三十多个工，最后如期完成了全部桥墩的模型板的制作和安装任务。很多狂风暴雨的日子，机电工区的工棚里仍然日夜闪耀着电焊的火花，为建筑桥墩加工各种钢筋材料。保健站、食堂里的及其他的工作人员，也日夜三班轮流支持工程的进行。
