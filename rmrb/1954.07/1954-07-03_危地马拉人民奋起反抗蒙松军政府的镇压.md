Xinhua News Agency, London, July 2nd: The terrorist repression of the Guatemalan Monson military government has been met with resistance from the masses. According to news agency reports, after Monson came to power, he intensified the persecution of democratic parties and organizations that had supported President Arbenz's government. At the same time, he is using his main force to strike at the National Guard established by the Arbenz government to resist reactionary forces at home and abroad. The military government issued a special order requiring all citizens to hand over all their weapons to the authorities, under penalty of death. But this repressive measure has been resisted by the people.

According to the "New York Times," in the Escontla district (about fifty kilometers south of Guatemala City), several agricultural worker teams led by union leader Pellecer are digging trenches in preparation to resist the army controlled by the military government. Agence France-Presse reported that there were rumors of "fierce fighting" in Puerto Barrios between factions supporting and opposing the military government. News from other regions of Guatemala also said that conflicts are occurring between the reactionary government's army and the people.

    危地马拉人民奋起反抗蒙松军政府的镇压
    【新华社二日讯】据塔斯社伦敦一日讯：危地马拉蒙松军人政府的恐怖镇压遭到人民群众的反抗。据通讯社消息，蒙松上台后一面加紧迫害那些曾支持阿本斯总统政府的民主党派和组织，一方面正在以主要的力量打击阿本斯政府所建立的、抵抗国内外反动派的国民警卫队；军政府曾下了一道特别的命令，要全体公民将自己所有各种武器缴给当局，违者处以死刑。但是这种镇压措施遭到人民的反抗。
    据“纽约时报”报道，在艾斯孔特区（危地马拉城以南约五十公里处）由工会领袖佩莱塞领导的几个农业工人队正在挖战壕，准备抵抗军人政府控制下的军队。法新社记者报道，传说拥护与反对军政府两派在巴利俄港进行“激烈的战斗”。从危地马拉其他地区传来的消息也说，反动政府的军队和人民之间正在发生冲突。
