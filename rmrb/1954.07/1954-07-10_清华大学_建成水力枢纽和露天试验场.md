Tsinghua University
Builds Hydraulic Hub and Open-Air Test Site

Tsinghua University recently completed a hydraulic hub and open-air test site for experiments and research in water supply engineering structures and water energy utilization courses. The completion ceremony was held on June 27th.

The hydraulic hub is built on the school's river. Its normal water level is 42.8 meters, and the maximum flood discharge of the spillway dam and flood discharge hole is 15 cubic meters per second. A small hydropower station is built next to the spillway dam, which can generate 7 kilowatts. The open-air test site is built on the east bank downstream of the hydraulic hub. It has an area of 1,800 square meters and a maximum application flow of 1 cubic meter per second, and can work for seven or eight months a year except in cold weather.

This hydraulic hub was designed and built with the initiative and concrete assistance of Soviet expert Comrade Gor'kyenko, starting in September and October last year. Relevant teaching and research groups, internship factory personnel, and students of Tsinghua University actively participated in the construction of this hydraulic hub and open-air test site. After the completion of the hydraulic hub and open-air test site, the experiments of water engineering structures and water energy utilization courses and the scientific research work of the Department of Hydraulic Engineering of Tsinghua University will enter a new stage. At the same time, this new type of experimental equipment can directly serve industrial departments. Before the entire project was completed in early June, they had already begun a holistic model test of scour downstream of the dam for a certain hydraulic hub; in the future, large-scale hydraulic hubs in the upper and lower reaches of the Yellow River and the Yangtze River can also be tested here.

    清华大学
    建成水力枢纽和露天试验场
    清华大学最近建成了供水工结构和水能利用课程作实验及研究用的水力枢纽及露天试验场，六月二十七日举行了落成典礼。
    水力枢纽建造在该校的校河上。它的正常挡水位是四十二点八公尺，滚水坝及泄水孔的最大泄洪流量为十五秒公方。滚水坝旁建有小型水电站，可以发电七瓩。露天试验场建在水力枢纽下游东岸。它的面积有一千八百平方公尺，最大应用流量为一秒公方，除寒冷天气外，一年可工作七、八个月。
    这座水力枢纽是在苏联专家高尔竞可同志倡议和具体帮助下，从去年九、十月开始设计和修建的。清华大学有关教研组、实习工厂的人员和学生们积极参加了这个水力枢纽和露天试验场的建筑工作。水力枢纽及露天试验场建成以后，清华大学水工结构和水能利用课程的实验和水利系的科学研究工作将进入一个新阶段。同时，这个新型实验设备可以直接为产业部门服务。在六月初全部工程还没有完成以前，他们就已开始为某水力枢纽作坝下冲刷的整体模型试验；将来黄河、长江上下游的巨型水力枢纽也可以在这里进行试验。
