Xinhua News Agency, July 9th, New York: Workers at two U.S. atomic weapons material manufacturing plants and rubber workers have launched strikes in the past two days.

According to U.S. news agency reports: Workers at atomic weapons material manufacturing plants in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and Paducah, Kentucky, began strikes on the 7th, demanding higher wages. This is the first strike in the history of the U.S. atomic weapons manufacturing industry. Approximately 3,000 workers are participating in the strike at the Oak Ridge plant, and 971 workers are participating in the strike at the Paducah plant. These two factories are the sole suppliers of uranium used by the U.S. in the manufacture of atomic weapons. According to reports, U.S. Atomic Energy Commission Chairman Strauss has formally informed Eisenhower that the strike "threatens national security." Government spokesmen admit that if these factories are shut down for 48 hours, the substances flowing through the factory pipelines will congeal, and the factories will have to be rebuilt.

On July 8th, 30,000 members of the United Rubber Workers union in New York began a strike. The strike covers ten factories in eight states belonging to the "Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company." According to union president Buckmaster, "This strike was caused by the company's refusal to raise wages."

    美国原子武器原料制造工厂的工人罢工
    【新华社九日讯】纽约消息：美国两家原子武器原料制造工厂的工人和橡胶工人在最近两天先后举行罢工。
    据美国通讯社的消息说：田纳西州奥克里治和肯塔基州巴丢卡两地的原子武器原料制造工厂的工人在七日开始举行罢工，要求提高工资。这是美国原子武器制造工业历史上第一次举行的罢工。参加奥克里治工厂罢工的约有三千工人，参加巴丢卡工厂罢工的有九百七十一名工人。这两家工厂是美国制造原子武器所使用的铀的唯一供应者。据消息说：美国原子能委员会主席斯特劳斯已正式告知艾森豪威尔说，这次罢工“威胁国家的安全”。政府发言人承认：如果这些工厂停工四十八小时，那么工厂管道中流通的物质将会凝结起来，这些工厂就得重新改建。
    在七月八日，纽约三万名联合橡胶工人工会的会员开始罢工。罢工范围包括“固特异轮胎橡胶公司”八个州的十家工厂。据工会主席巴克马斯特说：“这次罢工是因为公司拒绝提高工资而引起的。”
