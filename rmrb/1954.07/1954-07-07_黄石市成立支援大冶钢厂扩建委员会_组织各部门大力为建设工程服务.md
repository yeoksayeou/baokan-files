The Huangshi City Support Daye Steel Plant Expansion Committee has been established in Hubei's Huangshi City. The committee members are heads of departments such as the City Industry and Commerce Bureau, Local Industry Bureau, Labor Bureau, Grain Bureau, and Cooperative Section. Yang Rui, Secretary of the CPC Huangshi City Committee, and Song Zhongzhou, Acting Mayor, serve as the chairman and vice-chairman of the committee, respectively.

Currently, the committee is actively organizing relevant departments to serve the Daye Steel Plant expansion project. In terms of equipment supply, the City Hardware Company originally had only a few dozen varieties, but now it has increased to more than a thousand. The company has also dispatched liaison officers to Wuhan, Shanghai, and other cities to specifically handle material supply coordination. The City Brick and Tile Factory's third-quarter production will increase by 20% compared to the second quarter. The thousands of cubic meters of special "granite" needed for the Daye Steel Plant's open hearth furnace project have been organized by the Quarry, with thousands of workers mining them. In terms of transportation, the City Transportation Bureau is building two important transportation routes for the Daye Steel Plant. In addition, it is also preparing to build a lakeside road. The City Transportation Bureau has also established a joint office system to uniformly dispatch vehicles and ships throughout the city. A planned transportation committee will also be established in the third quarter to further strengthen connections with the Daye Steel Plant and other factories and mines, and sign transportation contracts. In terms of non-staple food supply, in addition to organizing the supply of vegetables and fresh fish in the city, the City Cooperative, Food Company, and Exchange are also preparing to sign long-term supply and sales contracts for non-staple foods with Huanggang, Xishui, Echeng, Daye, and other counties. State-owned commercial and cooperative departments are preparing to establish mobile supply teams at the construction site to provide workers with beverages, cigarettes, and other daily necessities at any time and any place. Banks will set up savings kiosks at the construction site, the post office will set up a construction site post office, and the bookstore will set up a book kiosk at the construction site. In terms of cultural entertainment, a basic construction service team has been formed to go deep into the construction site to guide workers' amateur theater troupes and the publicity work of the construction site radio, and to hold "Construction Site Battle Reports," "Construction Site Radio," "Honor Rolls," and "Big Character Posters," etc. The City Bureau of Culture and Education has decided to assist factories and mines in establishing construction site clubs and building a theater near the construction site. The City Cultural Center will establish a mobile construction site library, and the provincial and municipal film teams have decided to regularly tour the construction site for screenings.
