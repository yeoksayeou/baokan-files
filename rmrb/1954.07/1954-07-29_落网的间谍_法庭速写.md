The captured spy
--A Courtroom Sketch
By I. Kunchayev, Soviet Union

Standing before the court is a short Japanese man of about thirty years of age. He is the defendant, Tagane Akioshi, a former Japanese army officer. The court patiently and meticulously examines all the circumstances surrounding Tagane Akioshi's infiltration into a certain island in the eastern part of the Soviet Union.

Tagane Akioshi is not one for many words, answering the presiding judge's questions with a simple "yes" or "no." He tries his best not to look at the table, because there lie various items seized from him: a U.S.-made silent revolver, a repeating pistol, pistol bullets, a portable radio, signal lights, a compass, a sleeping bag, etc. Also displayed are several hand-drawn topographical maps.

The court records Tagane's confession. Finally, the defendant is asked what method he had prepared to use to return to Japan? Tagane Akioshi is silent for a moment, then suddenly begins to speak loudly, pouring out everything. Clearly, a change has taken place in his mind. He tells the court how those who gave him the espionage mission and sent him to the island swore to him that as soon as they received his request for help by radio, they would immediately send a fast speedboat to pick him up. But when the time came, and the only savior was this speedboat, his masters replied by radio: "Due to severe weather, the speedboat cannot sail. Destroy the evidence and pray to God."

The memory of this event ignites hatred in his heart for those who handed him over to God's protection. He speaks torrentially. First and foremost, he speaks of his masters. He narrates hatefully, frankly, and in detail, using precise, expert terminology.

"Yes," he says resolutely, "I am a staff member of the U.S. intelligence agency 'Counter Intelligence Corps,' abbreviated as CAC. One of its main offices is located in Sapporo, Hokkaido, northern Japan. This office is led by the notorious American spy, Lieutenant Colonel Ido. He is also my immediate superior. I was recruited as an agent in April 1951. I was trained at the American intelligence agent and radioman school. The address of the school is: South Sixteen Block, West Fifth Street, Sapporo."

The court listens to the American spy's detailed and accurate confession. He lists the names of Ido's close assistants: Captain Grieg, Case, Thomas, Blanc, Cade. He also names the Japanese involved: Ozo, Nakata, Gotō Yonekichi, Kyōgen, Watanabe.

The defendant describes in detail the number one expert in anti-Soviet sabotage activities living in Sapporo – Captain Grieg. It is he who is engaged in the selection and dispatch of spy saboteurs to the Soviet Union. Assisting him in this undertaking is Gotō Yonekichi, who is in charge of the entire supply of agents. Before October 1952, the dispatch of spy saboteurs to the Soviet Union was managed by Cade. Under the leadership of the American Cade, Tagane completed his first "voyage" to a Soviet island.

The court asks Tagane to describe his own espionage and sabotage activities in detail. The court's question makes the spy realize that he himself is a faithful servant of the very gang he has been denouncing with such hatred. Tagane immediately becomes a man of few words again. After much effort, the court finally clarifies all of the defendant's espionage activities.

Yes, he completed his first "voyage" in May 1952. He completed his second in October, and on October 24, 1953, Captain Grieg sent him on his third "voyage," which was also his last.

...On a gloomy autumn night, a small sailboat called "Sewa Maru" approaches a Soviet island. A small rubber boat is lowered from the sailboat, and Tagane Akioshi and his "companion" Takakashi reach the steep shore in this small boat. They cleverly hide themselves, draw topographical maps, and maintain constant radio contact with the CAC intelligence agency in Sapporo. Tagane falsely claims that they are merely surveying the terrain.

The court asks, "Then what were the silent weapons for?"

After a long silence, Tagane replies that these weapons were for silently eliminating sentries and other Soviet people who might hinder his infiltration into military target areas.

Everything went smoothly until November 10. At night, Tagane and Takakashi were hiding in the uninhabited fishermen's huts on the coast. When a Soviet border patrol discovered them here, the two spies opened fire. After a brief exchange of fire, the border guards stormed into the hut, but only found Takakashi's body there. Tagane had escaped. He fled into the mountains and immediately contacted Captain Grieg by radio. Tagane requested a speedboat. It was at this moment that he heard the advice to "pray to God." It was also at this same instant that he was captured by Soviet counterintelligence personnel.

Tagane Akioshi stands before the court, fully aware of the fate that awaits captured spy saboteurs, and thus the anger in his chest is rekindled, and he narrates the crimes of his masters.

"In their eyes, the value of my life is equal to a spit on the ground. What am I to them? They are destroying all of Japan. First, they dropped atomic bombs on us, and now they are doing the kind of things bombs can't do. Judges, do you know that the entire territory of Japan is covered with American military bases? We used to have brothels. Now the occupation forces have opened up many prostitution districts! Judges, do you know that there are six hundred thousand children in Japan born because of Americans?..."

The American spy saboteur Tagane Akioshi thus exposes his masters. Since even these human dregs, agents hired by the American intelligence agencies, are exposing their crimes, one can imagine how despicable and filthy the activities of these "masters" are.

The court pronounces the verdict - sentencing the American spy Tagane Akioshi to twenty-five years of imprisonment and sending him to a labor reform camp.

    落网的间谍
    ——法庭速写
    苏联　依·昆柴夫
    在法庭面前站着一个有三十岁左右的矮个子日本人。他是被告田荷秋良，前日本陆军军官。法庭耐心地、细致地审理着构成田荷秋良潜入苏联东部某岛的一切情况。
    田荷秋良是不爱多说话的，回答法庭主席问题时，只简短地说一声“是”或者“不是”。他竭力不往棹子上看，因为在那里放着从他那儿缴获的各种物品：美造无声左轮手枪、连发手枪、手枪子弹、手提式电台、信号灯、指南针、睡眠袋等。在那里摆着的还有几张用铅笔草绘出来的地形图。
    法庭记录着田荷的供词。最后向被告问及他曾准备用什么办法返回日本？田荷秋良沉默了片刻，忽然大声地讲起话来，倾吐着一切。显然的，这时在他的心理上发生了变化。他向法庭讲述着那些交给他间谍任务，派他到岛上去的人如何向他发誓说，一旦收到他由无线电发出的求救要求时，立刻就会派快速汽艇去接他。但当事到临头，唯一的救星就是这艘汽艇时，他的主子却用无线电回答说：“因天气恶劣，汽艇不能出海，毁灭证据，祈祷上帝。”
    对这件事的回忆，使他心中燃烧起对那些把他交给上帝保护的人们的憎恨。他滔滔不断地讲起来了。首先讲到的就是他们的那些主人。他痛恨地、爽快地、详尽地用精确的内行术语讲述着。
      “是的”，他毅然决然地说，“我是美国情报机关‘反谍报队’简称CAC的工作人员。它的一个主要的处设在日本北部北海道札幌市。这个处是由著名的美国间谍伊道中校领导的。他也就是我的主要长官。我是一九五一年四月被吸收做特务的。我曾在美国的情报员兼无线电报员的学校里受过训。学校的地址是：札幌市南十六区西第五町目。”
    法庭听着美国间谍详细而又准确的供述。他列举出伊道的亲密助手的姓名：格列上尉、凯斯、汤姆斯、布兰克、卡得。也供出日本人的姓名：奥佐、中田、后藤米次郎、教元、渡边。
    被告详细地叙述了住在札幌市的反苏破坏活动的头号专家——格列上尉。就是他在干着挑选和向苏联派遣间谍破坏分子的勾当。协助他进行这种勾当的，有主持特务全部供应事宜的后藤米次郎。一九五二年十月以前向苏联派遣间谍破坏分子的勾当是由卡得掌管的。在美国人卡得领导下，田荷完成了向苏联海岛的首次“航行”。
    法庭叫田荷详细地叙述一下自己的间谍破坏活动。法庭提出的问题使这个间谍理解到他本人就是他以如此痛恨的心情所供述的那帮人的忠实奴仆。于是田荷立时又变成不爱多说话的人了。法庭经过了一番努力终于弄清了被告的全部间谍活动情况。
    是的，他是在一九五二年五月完成了第一次“航行”。在十月间又完成了第二次，一九五三年十月二十四日，格列上尉又派他做第三次“航行”，也就是最后的一次。
    ……在一个阴沉的秋夜，一艘叫做“世话丸”的小型帆船驶近苏联某岛。从帆船上放下一只小橡皮船，田荷秋良和他的“同伴”高锹乘着这只小船到达了陡峭的岸边。他们巧妙地隐藏起来，绘制着地形图，并和札幌的CAC特务机关保持着经常的无线电联系。田荷诡称：他们仅仅是测绘地形。
    法庭问道：“那么无声武器又是干什么用的呢？”
    田荷沉默了许久以后，回答说，这种武器是为了无声无响地干掉哨兵及其他妨碍他潜入军事目标地区的苏联人。
    直到十一月十日以前，一切都进行得很顺利。夜里，田荷与高锹隐藏在海岸上无人居住的渔民茅屋里。当苏联边防军巡逻队在这里发现他们的时候，两个间谍开火了。经过短时的互相射击之后，边防战士冲进了茅屋，但在那儿只发现了高锹的尸体。田荷却跑掉了。他逃到山里，立刻用无线电和格列上尉联络。田荷请求派汽艇来。就是在这时候他听到了“祈祷上帝”的劝告。也就是在这同一瞬间他就被苏联肃反人员捕获了。
    田荷秋良站在法庭面前，他很清楚地知道，等待着落网的间谍破坏分子的是什么命运，因而他又重新燃起胸中的怒火，叙述着他的主子的罪恶。
    “我的生命价值，在他们看来，只等于吐在地上的一口痰。对他们说来，我算个什么呢？他们在毁灭着整个日本。起初，他们是向我们投原子弹，现在则干着炸弹所办不到的那种勾当。法官先生们，你们知道不知道，在整个日本的领土上，布满了美国的军事基地？从前我们那里就有妓馆。现在占领军却开辟了许多妓馆区！法官们，你们知道不知道，在日本有六十万儿童是由于美国人而降生的？……”
    美国间谍破坏分子田荷秋良就这样揭露着他的主子。既然连这些人类的渣滓，受雇于美国情报机关的特务都在揭发着他们的罪恶，那末，这些“主子”的活动是何等的卑鄙龌龊，就可想而知了。
    法庭宣读了判词——判处美国间谍田荷秋良徒刑二十五年，送劳动改造营改造。
