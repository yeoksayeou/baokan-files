Xinhua News Agency, July 1st dispatch from Paris: Parisian evening newspapers on June 29th, like the morning papers, pointed out that the Churchill-Eisenhower talks in Washington are a new pressure on France, with the aim of forcing it to approve the "European Army" treaty.

    "Le Monde," commenting on the talks, wrote: The Anglo-American declaration makes it clear: The debate on this treaty has dragged on for too long; it is fundamentally impossible to hold new negotiations. They are clearly trying to convince the French parliament that it has wasted time by thinking it was possible to make "another decision."

    Pierre, "Le Monde's" Washington correspondent, pointed out that Britain and the United States reached an agreement on the European Army issue "at the expense of France." The author wrote: "This means that the Anglo-Saxons are exerting new pressure to effectively limit the freedom of action that seems to have been granted to the head of the French government."

Xinhua News Agency, July 1st dispatch from Paris: The United States is exerting great pressure on the French government and parliament to quickly ratify the so-called "European Defense Community" treaty. French newspapers on June 30th emphasized that the "Atlantic pressure" France has recently been subjected to has taken on a new and sharper form.

    Parisian political observers are unanimous in the opinion that American diplomats have begun a large-scale offensive against France. President Eisenhower's recent letter to President René Coty, the Churchill-Eisenhower decision in Washington, and the speech given by U.S. Ambassador to Paris Dillon at the luncheon of the Anglo-American Press Association on June 29th are several stages of this offensive. Dillon said that France faces two paths: whether to control Germany's armed forces within the framework of the "European Defense Community" or to re-establish an independent German army. Parisian newspapers believe that Dillon's statement is a new example of blatant interference in French internal affairs.

Xinhua News Agency, July 1st dispatch from Washington, June 30th: The U.S. House of Representatives passed the amendment to the "Mutual Security Act" proposed by Republican Vorys (Ohio). The purpose of this amendment is to oppose the British plan for so-called "security in Southeast Asia." Vorys said when he proposed his amendment that Congress should clearly point out that the United States does not want any treaty in Southeast Asia in the form suggested by Eden. The amendment suggests that no funds provided under the "Mutual Security Act" should be used to aid governments that have treaty obligations with "communist countries."

    During the discussion of this amendment, House Democratic Leader McCormack (Massachusetts) delivered a sharp anti-British speech. He said he was "deeply indignant" at Eden's speech in the House of Commons.

    The House of Representatives also passed a resolution to stop further appropriations to Britain for the production of military aircraft. The "Mutual Security Act" originally provided for an appropriation of $75 million for this purpose, but the House of Representatives rejected this new appropriation.

    美国向法英两国施加压力
    要法国迅速批准“欧洲军”条约反对英国对东南亚问题的主张
    【新华社一日讯】塔斯社巴黎讯：六月二十九日巴黎各晚报也如同晨报一样指出，邱吉尔和艾森豪威尔的华盛顿会谈是对法国的一个新压力，目的是要迫使它批准“欧洲军”条约。
      “世界报”评论这次会谈时写道：英美声明中说得很清楚：关于这一条约的辩论未免拖得太久了；要举行新的谈判是根本不可能的。他们显然企图使法国议会相信，它由于以为有可能作出“另外的决定”而浪费了时间。
    “世界报”驻华盛顿记者皮埃尔指出，英美之间“靠牺牲法国”在欧洲军问题上达成了协议。作者写道：“这就是说，盎格鲁撒克逊在施用新压力，以实际上限制似乎是给予了法国政府首脑的行动自由。”
    【新华社一日讯】据塔斯社巴黎讯：美国正对法国政府和议会大施压力，要它们迅速批准所谓的“欧洲防务集团”条约。六月三十日的法国报纸着重指出，近来，法国受到的“大西洋压力”已具有新的更尖锐的形式。
    巴黎政治观察家的一致意见是：美国外交界人士已经开始对法国发动大规模的攻势。艾森豪威尔总统最近给雷纳·戈蒂总统的信，邱吉尔和艾森豪威尔的华盛顿决定和美国驻巴黎大使狄龙六月二十九日在英美记者协会的午餐会上发表的演说是这个攻势的几个阶段。狄龙说，法国面临两条路：究竟是在“欧洲防务集团”范围内控制德国的武装呢？还是重新建立一支独立的德国军队。巴黎报纸认为狄龙的这句话是粗暴地干涉法国内政的一个新的例子。
    【新华社一日讯】据塔斯社华盛顿六月三十日讯：美国众议院通过了共和党人伏利斯（俄亥俄州）提出的关于“共同安全法”的修正案。这个修正案的目的是反对英国的所谓“保障东南亚安全”计划的。伏利斯提出自己的修正案时说，国会应当明白指出：美国不希望在东南亚出现按照艾登所建议的形式的任何条约。这个修正案建议不得利用根据“共同安全法”提供的拨款去援助和“共产党国家”有着条约约束的政府。
    在讨论这个修正案时，众议院民主党领袖麦考马克（马萨诸塞州）发表了尖锐的反英演说。他说，他对艾登在下院的发言“深感愤慨”。
    众议院还通过了停止再拨款给英国从事生产军用飞机的决议。“共同安全法”原规定拨款七千五百万美元以作此用，但是众议院拒绝了拨出这项新的拨款。
