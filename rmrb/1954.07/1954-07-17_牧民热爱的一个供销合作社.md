A Supply and Marketing Cooperative Loved by Herdsmen
	Dui Dai Runzhi
	The Ejin Banner Autonomous Region in Ningxia Province is a pastoral area. The nearest city to it is Jiuquan in Gansu, but it is still seven hundred li away. In the past, speculators transported grain and industrial products from outside and sold them to herdsmen at high prices, while they only gave the lowest prices for the livestock products produced by the herdsmen. With each purchase and sale, the herdsmen suffered a great loss.
	In April last year, the Ejin Banner Supply and Marketing Cooperative was established. It immediately and actively helped herdsmen develop production and improve their lives. Originally, local herdsmen only sheared wool and did not collect绒 (róng, downy undercoat), because they were afraid that the sheep would die if they collected it. Last year, the cooperative supplied thirty wool combs and promoted the benefits of collecting絨 to the herdsmen. Some herdsmen started collecting絨. Last year, the whole banner collected more than seven hundred jin of sheep绒, and the herdsmen earned more than 15 million yuan (equivalent to the price of three thousand jin of goat wool). The herdsmen saw the benefits of collecting绒 with their own eyes, and more and more people are collecting絨. According to the lowest estimate, the whole banner can collect 1,500 jin of sheep绒 this year, and the herdsmen can increase their income by 30 million yuan. In the past, local herdsmen did not have the habit of cutting grass for grazing. Last year, the Banner People's Government promoted the idea of cutting and storing grass for the winter to the herdsmen, and the cooperative cooperated in supplying sickles, which promoted the work of cutting grass. This spring, through purchasing operations, the cooperative organized more than 600 herdsmen to carry out the sideline production of digging 苁蓉 (cōng róng, a medicinal herb). The herdsmen dug a total of 20,000 jin of 苁蓉, increasing their income by more than 60 million yuan.
	The main products of the herdsmen are hides and fur. After the establishment of the Ejin Banner Supply and Marketing Cooperative, it actively carried out the work of purchasing hides and fur, and reasonably adjusted the prices of livestock products. Before liberation, herdsmen had to take twenty jin of camel wool to exchange for a brick of tea, but now twenty jin of camel wool can be exchanged for five bricks of tea; in the past, more than thirty jin of camel wool could only be exchanged for one piece of clothing, but now it can be exchanged for four to five pieces. Every year, after selling their own hides and fur, and exchanging them for the grain and cloth they need, the herdsmen still have a surplus. The production of herdsmen is developing more and more, and their lives are getting better and better. Shao Namu, a herdsman in the First Bag, had nothing when he was just liberated, but now he has a Mongolian yurt, three camels, and forty sheep. Before liberation, herdsman Manji had eight camels and eighty sheep. At that time, hides and fur were worthless, so he exchanged livestock for things, and the livestock became less and less; in recent years, the cooperative has purchased livestock products at reasonable prices and supplied daily necessities, so he does not need to exchange livestock for things. Now he has twenty camels and one hundred and ninety sheep.
	As the income of the herdsmen increases and their purchasing power improves, they need to purchase various kinds of daily necessities. The Ejin Banner Supply and Marketing Cooperative has also tried its best to meet the requirements of the herdsmen in this regard. In the past, herdsmen lacked grain the most, and sometimes they had to pull camels to the outside to exchange for it. Now, the cooperative uses trucks and camels to transport a large amount of grain from Jiuquan, which can be bought at any time. In the past, herdsmen could only eat yellow rice, but now they can also eat white flour and white rice. In the past, it was good if a family of five could eat fifteen jin of grain a month; now, the family of Lu Shengda'erjia, a herdsman in the Third Bag, eats one hundred jin of flour and eighty jin of rice a month for a family of six. In the first five months of this year, the cooperative supplied 93,000 jin of flour, 30,000 jin of yellow rice and white rice. In the past, cloth was very scarce in the desert. Last year, the cooperative supplied an average of three zhang and four chi of cloth to each adult herdsman, and each person could wear two robes.
	Now, the Mongolian girls who live on the grassland wear all kinds of brightly colored floral clothes, which make them look more sturdy and beautiful. New quilts that were difficult to see in the past have been added to each Mongolian yurt, and some have also purchased towels, toothbrushes, and toothpaste that were rare in the desert in the past. In the past, the place where teapots were placed is now often filled with thermos bottles.
	The staff of the supply and marketing cooperative wholeheartedly serve the herdsmen. They not only did a good job in building state-owned stores, but also often sent mobile trade groups to carry out supply and marketing operations. The Fifth Bag is more than 120 li away from Jianguoying. The cadres of the supply and marketing cooperative use cars to pull grain to the doorsteps of the herdsmen to sell it. If the herdsmen arrive at Jianguoying at night, the cadres of the supply and marketing cooperative will turn on the lights to collect wool and sell goods.
	The herdsmen all love their cooperative. Whenever the cooperative's mobile trade group goes to a place, the local herdsmen help sell goods and solve the cadres' difficulties in food and accommodation; when the trade group leaves, the herdsmen lead their own camels to carry the cooperative's goods to another place. The herdsmen personally experience that the supply and marketing cooperative is their own business. Now 794 people have joined the cooperative, accounting for 35% of the total population of the banner.

    牧民热爱的一个供销合作社
    对岱  润之
    宁夏省额济纳旗自治区是一个牧区，离它最近的城市是甘肃酒泉，但是相距也有七百华里。过去，投机商人从外面运来粮食和工业品，高价卖给牧民，牧民生产的畜产品，他们却只给最低的价钱。一买一卖，牧民就吃很大的亏。
    去年四月间，额济纳旗供销合作社成立了。它马上就积极帮助牧民发展生产，改善生活。原来，当地的牧民只剪毛不抓羢，他们怕抓了羢羊会死掉。去年，合作社供应了三十把羊毛抓子，向牧民宣传了抓羢的好处。有些牧民开始抓羢了，去年全旗一共抓了七百多斤羊羢，牧民们多收入了一千五百多万元（等于三千斤山羊毛的价钱）。牧民们亲眼看到抓羢的好处，抓羢的人越来越多。今年据最低的估计，全旗可以抓一千五百斤羊羢，牧民们可以增加三千万元的收入。当地牧民过去放羊没有打草的习惯，去年旗人民政府向牧民宣传了打草储草过冬的道理，合作社配合供应了镰刀，推动了打草工作。今年春上，合作社通过收购业务，组织六百多个牧民开展了挖苁蓉的副业生产。牧民们一共挖了两万斤苁蓉，增加了六千多万元的收入。
    牧民的主要产品是皮毛。额济纳旗供销合作社成立以后，积极展开收购皮毛的工作，并且合理地调整了畜产品的价格。解放以前，牧民们拿上二十斤驼毛才能换到一块砖茶，现在二十斤驼毛能换到五块砖茶；过去三十多斤驼毛只能换一件衣服，现在能换到四件到五件。每家牧民每年卖出自己的皮毛，换回需要的粮食和布匹以后，还有富裕。牧民们生产越来越发展，生活越来越好了。第一巴格的牧民稍那木在刚解放的时候啥都没有，现在已经有了一个蒙古包、三只骆驼和四十只羊。牧民曼吉在解放前有八只骆驼、八十只羊，那时候皮毛不值钱，买东西就拿牲口换，牲口越换越少；这几年，合作社用合理的价格收购畜产品，供应生活用品，他不需要用牲口换东西了，现在已经有二十只骆驼、一百九十只羊。
    牧民收入增加，购买力提高了，需要购买各种各样的生活必需品。额济纳旗供销合作社在这方面也尽量满足了牧民的要求。过去牧民最缺乏粮食，有时要拉上骆驼到外面去换。现在，合作社用汽车、骆驼从酒泉运进大量的粮食，什么时候都可以买到。过去牧民只能吃到黄米，现在也能吃到白面、白米了。过去，五口之家一个月能吃上十五斤粮食就算挺好了；现在，第三巴格的牧民路生达而嘉家，一家六口人一个月就吃一百斤面、八十斤米。今年上半年五个月中，合作社就供应了九万三千斤面粉、三万斤黄米和白米。过去，沙窝中布匹很缺。去年合作社平均供应给每个成年牧民三丈四尺布，每个人能穿上两件长袍。
    现在，生活在草原上的蒙族姑娘，穿上了各样颜色鲜艳的花衣服，显得更加健壮美丽。每个蒙古包里都添置了过去很难看到的新被子，有的还购置了过去沙窝中罕见的毛巾、牙刷和牙膏。过去放盛茶壶的地方，现在很多都摆上了热水瓶。
    供销合作社的工作人员全心全意地为牧民服务。他们不但搞好了建国营门市部的工作，还经常派出流动贸易组开展供销业务。第五巴格离建国营有一百二十多里路，供销合作社的干部用车把粮食拉到牧民家门口去卖。如果牧民夜里到了建国营，供销合作社的干部就点起灯来收毛，卖货。
    牧民们都热爱着自己的合作社。合作社流动贸易组每到一个地方，当地的牧民就帮着卖货，给干部解决食宿困难；贸易组离开时，牧民便牵上自己的骆驼，把合作社的货驮到另外一个地方。牧民亲身体验到供销合作社是自己的商业，现在已经有七百九十四个人参加了合作社，占全旗人口总数的百分之三十五。
