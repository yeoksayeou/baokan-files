[This article] reports that many counties and cities in Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Xikang, Jiangsu, Henan and other provinces held their first sessions of the first People's Congress, enthusiastically discussed the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China, and passed resolutions endorsing the Draft Constitution.

The first sessions of the first People's Congress were successively convened in twenty-four counties and cities including Mianyang, Leshan, Wanxian, and Mianzhu in Sichuan Province; Ya'an City and eighteen counties in the Han areas of Xikang Province; most counties and cities in Guizhou Province including Xiuwen, Langdai, and Pingba; and counties and cities in Yunnan Province including Kunming and Mengzi. In the discussions of the Draft Constitution, the people's representatives of each county and city related their personal experiences and expressed their heartfelt support for the Draft Constitution. He Chengfa, a representative from Wanxian County, Sichuan Province, who started herding cattle and working as a hired hand at the age of eleven, was elected as township head and county people's representative in the general election. He said: "The reason we were oppressed in the past was because the working people did not hold power. Now we have become the masters of the country, and we are discussing and formulating the country's fundamental law. This is truly a joyous thing." Xiao Xianhua (worker), a representative from Xiuwen County, Guizhou Province, said: "I have enjoyed many of the rights of the working people stipulated in the Draft Constitution in the years since liberation. The Draft Constitution stipulates that the state is led by our working class, ensuring that our country will be built into a prosperous and happy socialist society. Therefore, I feel honored and also feel the great responsibility." Geng Zhengquan, a representative from Ya'an County, Xikang Province, recalled his participation in the Red Army's northward march against Japan in 1935 and the arduous struggle and heroic fighting of the Eighth Route Army during the Anti-Japanese War. He excitedly said: "In the past, we working people, unable to bear the oppression and exploitation, rose up in revolution under the leadership of the Communist Party to fight for freedom and rights. Many people sacrificed their lives and shed their blood to exchange for the happy life we have today. Today's Draft Constitution has written our long-cherished wishes on it." After the representatives had a heated discussion of the Draft Constitution, their confidence in building socialism was greatly enhanced. They all expressed that they would actively produce and strive to complete various work tasks to celebrate the promulgation of the Draft Constitution. Wang Jingyi, a people's representative from Pengxi County, Sichuan Province, and a well-known cotton planting model in Southwest China, guaranteed that their mutual aid group's cotton production would increase by 23 percent based on last year's production. He also expressed that they would create conditions and actively strive to establish agricultural production cooperatives, following the path stipulated for farmers in the Draft Constitution. People's representatives from various places have expressed that they will widely convey the resolutions endorsing the Draft Constitution passed at the meeting to the masses, further consolidate the people's democratic system, and will lead the masses to earnestly abide by and implement the Constitution after its official promulgation.

Since late June, most counties in Jiangsu Province have successively convened the first sessions of their first People's Congress. At the meetings, the people's representatives of each county listened to reports on the Draft Constitution, understood the basic spirit and main content of the Draft Constitution, and launched heated discussions. Workers, peasants, fishermen, fruit farmers, silkworm farmers, and people from cultural and educational circles and business circles among the people's representatives actively spoke during the discussions. Ding Junyu, a people's representative from Siyang County and a worker, said: "Before liberation, we workers had no rights and no freedom. After liberation, we became the masters of the country. Now the Draft constitution stipulates that the People's Republic of China is a people's democratic country led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants. This further guarantees the leading position of our working class. We must actively do a good job in production and strive to realize socialism as soon as possible." Other worker representatives also expressed that they would welcome the Draft Constitution with practical actions. You Guangcheng, a people's representative from Lianshui County and director of an agricultural production cooperative, cited facts in the discussion to explain that only by developing mutual aid and cooperation can we create a happy life of common prosperity and finally get rid of poverty. He said: "Before the organization of mutual aid groups in 1951, our sixteen households were short of food for four months each year; in 1952, after the organization of mutual aid groups, only eight households were short of food for more than a month; in 1953, after the establishment of the cooperative, the situation was even more different. By winter, eighteen families sold 18,000 jin of surplus grain; this year, in the wheat season alone, we sold 12,000 jin of surplus grain." During the discussion, the people's representatives of each county expressed their firm support for the basic policies on urban and rural capitalist economy stipulated in the Draft Constitution, and exposed the illegal activities of unlawful rich peasants who undermined the unified purchase and sale and mutual aid and cooperation. Many representatives also criticized their past vague understanding of the rich peasant economy in connection with their own thoughts. In the discussions, the people's representatives of each county, combined with examples in production, realized that to build a socialist society, it is necessary to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, develop the cooperative economy, and earnestly fulfill the obligations of citizens under the leadership of the working class. Many agricultural production experts have expressed that they will increase production targets, over fulfill the original production plan, and support the national industrialization.

Zhengzhou, Anyang and other cities and more than ten counties such as Linxian and Tangyin in Henan Province, where the People's Congress meetings are currently being held, have also listed the discussion of the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China as an important item on the agenda, and will organize the representatives to convey it to the broad masses after the meeting. When the representatives of the first session of the first People's Congress of Zhengzhou City discussed the Draft Constitution, representatives from all strata such as workers, engineers, peasants, government cadres, ethnic minorities, cultural and educational circles, and medical circles vividly and concretely explained the correctness of the Draft Constitution in light of their own personal experiences. In addition to sincerely supporting the Draft Constitution, all the representatives also expressed that they would vigorously publicize and organize the people of the city to actively participate in the discussion, deeply understand the spirit and content of the Draft Constitution, put forward opinions, and mobilize the people of the city to greet the birth of our country's first constitution with practical actions of active production and improved work.

    许多县市召开人民代表大会会议
    热烈讨论和拥护宪法草案
    【本报讯】四川、云南、贵州、西康、江苏、河南等省许多县市召开第一届第一次人民代表大会会议，热烈讨论了中华人民共和国宪法草案，并通过了拥护宪法草案的决议。
    四川省绵阳、乐山、万县、绵竹等二十四个县、市，西康省雅安市和汉族地区十八个县，贵州省修文、郎岱、平坝等大部分县、市和云南省昆明、蒙自等县、市，相继召开了第一届第一次人民代表大会会议。各县、市人民代表在讨论宪法草案中都联系亲身经历的事实，畅述自己衷心拥护宪法草案的心情。从十一岁就帮人放牛作雇工的四川省万县人民代表何成发，普选中被选为乡长和县人民代表。他说：“以前我们所以受压迫，就是因为劳动人民没有掌权，现在我们作了国家的主人，由我们来讨论和制定国家大法，这真是令人高兴的事。”贵州省修文县人民代表萧显华（工人）说：“宪法草案规定的许多劳动人民的权利，解放几年来我都享受到了。宪法草案规定国家由我们工人阶级来领导，保证我国建成繁荣幸福的社会主义社会，因此我感到光荣，也感到责任的重大。”西康省雅安县人民代表耿正全在讨论中，回忆到他在一九三五年参加红军北上抗日和抗日战争中八路军艰苦奋斗、英勇作战的情景时，兴奋地说：“过去我们劳动人民因为受不了压迫和剥削，在共产党领导下起来革命，争取自由权利，多少人牺牲了生命，流了鲜血，才换来今天幸福的生活。今天的宪法草案把我们多年来的愿望都写在上面了。”代表们对宪法草案进行热烈讨论后，大大增强了建设社会主义的信心，都表示要积极生产，努力完成各项工作任务，来庆贺宪法草案的公布。四川省蓬溪县人民代表、西南著名植棉模范王精益保证他们互助组的棉花要在去年的基础上增产百分之二十三。他还表示要创造条件，积极争取建立农业生产合作社，走宪法草案为农民规定的道路。各地人民代表都纷纷表示要将会议通过的拥护宪法草案的决议广泛向人民群众传达，进一步巩固人民民主制度，并要在宪法正式公布后带领群众认真遵守和实施。
    江苏省大多数县份从六月下旬起，先后召开了第一届一次人民代表大会会议。各县人民代表在会议上听了关于宪法草案的报告，了解了宪法草案的基本精神和主要内容，热烈地展开了讨论。人民代表中的工人、农民、渔民、果农、蚕农和文教界、工商界人士，在讨论中踊跃发言。泗阳县人民代表、工人丁俊余说：“解放前，我们工人没有权利，没有自由。解放后，我们成了国家的主人。现在宪法草案规定中华人民共和国是工人阶级领导的、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主国家。这更保障了我们工人阶级的领导地位，我们要积极搞好生产，争取早日实现社会主义。”其他工人代表也都表示要用实际行动欢迎宪法草案。涟水县人民代表、农业生产合作社社长尤广成在讨论中，列举事实说明，只有发展互助合作，才能创造大家富裕的幸福生活，才能够最后摆脱贫困。他说：“一九五一年组织互助组以前，我们十六户，家家要缺四个月吃粮；一九五二年组织了互助组，就只有八户缺一个多月吃粮；一九五三年成立了合作社，情况更不同了，到冬天，十八家卖出一万八千斤余粮；今年仅麦季就卖出余粮一万二千斤。”在讨论中，各县人民代表表示坚决拥护宪法草案规定的对城乡资本主义经济的基本政策，并揭露了不法富农破坏统购统销、互助合作等非法行为。不少代表还联系自己的思想批判了过去对富农经济的模糊认识。各县人民代表在讨论中，都结合生产中的实例，体会到：要建成社会主义社会，必须在工人阶级领导下，巩固工农联盟，发展合作经济，切实履行公民的义务。很多农业生产能手都表示要提高生产指标，超额完成原订生产计划，支援国家工业化。
    河南省目前正在召开人民代表大会会议的郑州、安阳等市和林县、汤阴等十多个县，也都把讨论中华人民共和国宪法草案列为重要议题，会后并将组织代表们向广大群众进行传达。郑州市第一届第一次人民代表大会会议的代表在讨论宪法草案时，工人、工程师、农民、机关干部和少数民族、文教界、医务界等各阶层的代表，都结合着自己的亲身体会，生动具体地说明了宪法草案的正确性。全体代表除了竭诚拥护宪法草案外，还表示要大力宣传和组织全市人民积极参加讨论，深刻领会宪法草案的精神和内容，提出意见，并动员全市人民以积极生产、提高工作的实际行动，来迎接我国第一个宪法的诞生。
