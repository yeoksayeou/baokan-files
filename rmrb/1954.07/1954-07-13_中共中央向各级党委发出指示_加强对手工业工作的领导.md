The CCP Central Committee issued instructions to Party committees at all levels on June 22 regarding the "Report on the Third National Handicraft Production Cooperative Conference." The instructions first pointed out that the development plan and various opinions proposed in the report of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives (the full text of the report will be issued separately) are correct. It is hoped that all localities will implement them according to the specific conditions of local handicrafts.

The instructions said that this report analyzes the important position of handicrafts in the national economy, points out that it is necessary to take the road of cooperativization to realize the socialist transformation of individual handicrafts by the state, and summarizes the organizational forms and preliminary experiences of the handicraft cooperativization movement, and puts forward a development plan for handicraft cooperativization, all of which are very good. The instructions require all localities to earnestly run the existing handicraft production cooperatives well, gain experience, and set examples as a necessary preparation for widely carrying out the handicraft cooperativization movement. In order to realize the country's socialist industrialization, we should first concentrate our main efforts on developing heavy industry, but we must also correspondingly develop light industry, local industry, and handicrafts to supplement the inadequacy of large-scale state-owned industrial production and meet the growing needs of the broad masses of people. This is very important and should be taken seriously by the whole Party.

The instructions require all relevant departments in the state-owned economy, supply and marketing cooperatives, consumer cooperatives, and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions to provide necessary assistance to handicraft production cooperatives, and take concrete measures to effectively assist handicrafts in realizing socialist transformation.

In order to strengthen leadership over handicraft production and handicraft cooperativization work, the instructions stipulate:

	I. Party committees above the provincial level should designate certain working departments (urban work departments, rural work departments, or commercial departments) to be responsible for leading handicraft work. The prefectural and county Party committees should also designate a committee member to be responsible, and can designate full-time personnel in their subordinate research offices or departments with similar responsibilities to help the Party committee carry out handicraft work. Large and medium-sized cities should be led by a designated institution of the municipal Party committee.

	II. People's governments at all levels should regard handicrafts as an important part of local industry. The central government must establish a Handicraft Administration Bureau, provinces and cities should set up Handicraft Administration Bureaus or departments, and special districts and counties may set up Handicraft Management Sections or be concurrently managed by the Industry and Commerce Section depending on the development of handicrafts. At the same time, in order to strengthen the unity and education of handicraft workers, local areas can regularly convene representative meetings of handicraft workers, and can selectively pilot the establishment of handicraft workers' associations.

	III. Party committees and governments at all levels should, with the progress of handicraft cooperativization, help handicraft production cooperatives gradually establish federations of handicraft production cooperatives at all levels. Before the establishment of production federations, the local supply and marketing cooperative federations will be temporarily responsible for leadership.

	IV. In the handicraft production cooperatives that have already been organized, the Party's political leadership should be strengthened, the work of developing Party and League members should be carried out in a planned way, and the Party's leading core should be established. In addition, Party committees at all levels should also plan to dispatch, select, and train a group of cadres for handicraft production cooperatives. It must be understood that without the leadership of the Party, and without a group of cadres with a considerable political level and familiar with the business, it is impossible to smoothly realize the historical task of socialist transformation of handicrafts.

    中共中央向各级党委发出指示
    加强对手工业工作的领导
    【本报讯】中共中央在六月二十二日向各级党委发出“关于第三次全国手工业生产合作会议的报告”的指示。指示首先指出中华全国合作社联合总社的报告（报告全文另发）中所提发展计划和各项意见，是正确的。希望各地根据当地手工业的具体情况布置实行。
    指示说，这个报告分析了手工业在国民经济中的重要地位，指出必须走合作化的道路来实现国家对个体手工业的社会主义改造，并且总结了手工业合作化运动的组织形式和初步经验，提出了手工业合作化的发展计划，这都是很好的。指示要求各地切实办好现有的手工业生产合作社，取得经验，树立榜样，作为广泛开展手工业合作化运动的必要准备。为实现国家的社会主义工业化，应首先集中主要力量发展重工业，同时也必须相应地发展轻工业、地方工业和手工业，以补充国营大工业生产的不足，满足广大人民群众的日益增长的需要。这是非常重要的，应引起全党重视。
    指示要求国营经济中各个有关部门，供销合作社、消费合作社和全国工会系统对手工业生产合作社进行必要的援助，并采取具体措施，有效地协助手工业实现社会主义改造。
    为加强对手工业生产和手工业合作化工作的领导，指示规定：
    一、省以上的党委要指定一定的工作部门（城市工作部门、农村工作部门或商业部门）负责领导手工业的工作，地委、县委也应指定一个委员负责，并可在所属研究室或职责相近的部门内指定专人帮助党委进行手工业方面的工作，大中城市则由市委指定一定机构负责领导。
    二、各级人民政府应将手工业视为地方工业的一个重要组成部分。中央须设立手工业管理局，省市设手工业管理局或处，专区和县可视手工业发展与否而专设手工业管理科或由工商科兼管。同时，为加强对手工业劳动者的团结教育，各地可定期召开手工业劳动者代表会议，并可选择重点试办手工业劳动者协会。
    三、各级党委和政府应随着手工业合作化的进展，帮助手工业生产合作社逐步建立各级手工业生产合作社联合社。在生产联合社未建立以前，暂由当地的供销合作社联合社负责领导。
    四、在已经组织起来的手工业生产合作社中，应加强党的政治领导，有步骤地进行发展党、团员的工作，并建立党的领导核心。此外，各级党委还应有计划地派遣、选择并培养训练一批手工业生产合作社的干部。必须了解没有党的领导，没有一批有相当政治水平并且熟悉业务的干部，就不可能顺利实现对手工业的社会主义改造的历史任务。
