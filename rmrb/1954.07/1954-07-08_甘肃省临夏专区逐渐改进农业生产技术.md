    Gansu Province Linxia Special District Gradually Improves Agricultural Production Technology
    Farmers of various ethnic groups in the Linxia Special District of Gansu Province, including Hui, Han, Dongxiang, Baoan, and Salar, have gradually improved their agricultural production techniques. During this year's spring plowing and sowing, many farmers of various ethnic groups in mountainous and river valley areas changed from broadcasting to row sowing. According to statistics from the Guangtong Hui Autonomous Region, this year's summer fields using row sowing covered more than 92,300 mu, accounting for 73 percent of the total summer field sowing area. In the river valley and plateau areas, the planting area of the "No. 96" improved wheat variety has expanded more than threefold compared to last year. The sown area of wheat, barley, and other crops treated with "Ceresan" seed dressing reached more than 100,880 mu, and the area of farmland using chemical fertilizers as a priority also reached more than 8,000 mu. Farmers of various ethnic groups organized in Hezheng, Linxia, and the Dongxiang Autonomous Region have also carried out seedling setting, thinning, and replanting in some seedling fields, and weeding has been done two or three times. In order to effectively irrigate farmland and save water, more than 60 percent of the 170,000 mu of paddy fields in the entire special district have been changed from the past "large-scale flooding irrigation" and "serial flooding irrigation" to small-plot irrigation, achieving frequent and shallow irrigation and rational water use.
    The various new-style farm tools used by farmers of all ethnic groups are also increasing daily. At present, in addition to the more than 2,880 walking plows being loaned out, the various new-style walking plows used in the more than 11,000 agricultural production mutual aid teams and three agricultural production cooperatives, as well as some individual farmers in the entire special district, already number 1,405. In the Guangtong Hui Autonomous Region, the Panjia Village Agricultural Production Cooperative, composed of Hui farmers, has used horse-drawn seeders and horse-drawn harvesters. Along the banks of the Da Xia River, Guangtong River, Yellow River, and Tao River, farmers of various ethnic groups use 180 Liberation-style waterwheels. At present, a bumper harvest of more than 1.3 million mu of summer crops is expected in all counties (cities) and autonomous regions of the special district, and autumn crops are also growing well.

    甘肃省临夏专区逐渐改进农业生产技术
    甘肃省临夏专区回、汉、东乡、保安、撒拉等族农民已逐渐改进农业生产技术。今年春耕播种当中，许多山区和沿川地区的各族农民都把撒播改为条播。据广通回族自治区的统计，今年采用条播的夏田有九万二千三百多亩，占夏田总播种面积的百分之七十三。在川塬地区采用“九十六号”良种小麦的播种面积，比去年扩大了三倍以上。各地用“赛力散”药剂拌种的小麦、大麦等作物播种面积，达十万零八千八百多亩，重点使用化学肥料的农田也有八千多亩。和政、临夏等县和东乡族自治区组织起来的各族农民，在部分苗田中还进行了定苗、间苗、补苗等工作，锄草也达到两三次。为了有效地灌溉农田并节省用水，全专区十七万多亩水地有百分之六十以上都由过去的“大块漫灌”、“串地漫灌”改为小畦灌溉，作到勤灌浅浇、合理用水。
    各族农民使用的各种新式农具也日益增多。现在，除了正在贷放的两千八百八十多部步犁以外，在全专区的一万一千多个农业生产互助组和三个农业生产合作社以及部分个体农民中，使用的各种新式步犁已有一千四百零五部。在广通回族自治区，由回族农民组成的潘家村农业生产合作社已使用马拉播种机和马拉收割机。在大夏河、广通河、黄河、洮河等河沿岸，各族农民使用的解放式水车有一百八十部。现在全专区各县（市）和自治区的一百三十多万亩夏季作物丰收有望，秋季作物也生长良好。　　（新华社）
