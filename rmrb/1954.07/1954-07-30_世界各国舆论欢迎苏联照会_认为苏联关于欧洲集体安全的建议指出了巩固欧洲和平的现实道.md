Xinhua News Agency, July 29th: World opinion in various countries welcomes the Soviet government's note of July 24th to the governments of France, Britain, and the United States regarding the issue of European collective security.

    The "Neues Deutschland" of the German Democratic Republic pointed out: The proposal to convene a conference to discuss the issue of European collective security is a very important contribution to resolving international disputes through negotiation. After the establishment of peace in Indochina, the peace-loving people of Europe have every right to demand the establishment of a European security system. Therefore, the Soviet government's proposal has received very strong support from the German people.

    "Berliner Zeitung" and "Neue Zeit," the organ of the German Christian Democratic Union, also warmly welcomed the Soviet proposal.

    Czechoslovakia's "Rudé Právo" emphasized in its editorial: European security and mutual understanding cannot be achieved through the establishment of aggressive military blocs and the revival of German militarism.

    The results of the Geneva Conference show that only by strengthening cooperation among all countries (regardless of their social systems) and through consultation can agreements be reached on various international disputes.

    Poland's "Trybuna Ludu" emphasized: The strength of the Soviet proposal lies in the fact that these proposals point out a realistic path to consolidating European peace.

    Romania's "Scînteia" said: The realization of the treaty proposed by the Soviet Union will be the beginning of broad and effective cooperation among European countries.

    Hungary's "Szabad Nép" editorial said: After the Geneva Conference, the United States, having suffered a setback in Asia due to its aggressive policy, intends to compensate for it in Europe. Under these circumstances, raising the unresolved issue of European security for discussion is a more timely task than ever before.

    Bulgaria's "Rabotnichesko Delo" wrote: Since the Soviet government proposed at the Berlin Foreign Ministers' Conference the conclusion of an all-European treaty guaranteeing European collective security, the issue of establishing a collective security system has become the focus of public attention. The Soviet government's note is a new contribution to the realization of this constructive proposal by the Soviet Union.

    Albania's "Zëri i Popullit" editorial pointed out: The Soviet Union's new proposal not only lays the foundation for future negotiations but also opens the way to achieve this goal.

    The editorial in North Korea's "Rodong Sinmun" said: The agreement reached at the Geneva Conference on the Indochina issue promoted a further relaxation of international tensions, thereby not only creating favorable conditions for resolving urgent issues in Asia but also adding favorable factors to the resolution of a series of unresolved issues concerning Europe. The Korean people warmly welcome the new efforts of the Soviet government and hope that the ideal of guaranteeing collective security will be realized not only in Europe but also in Asia.

    The editorial in "Minju Choson" said: It is particularly noteworthy that the Soviet government's note suggests that the People's Republic of China send observers to attend the conference to discuss European collective security. Based on the significant role played by the People's Republic of China in safeguarding world peace and the experience of the Geneva Conference, the participation of the People's Republic of China will increase the possibility of reaching agreements among major powers.

    The "Telegraf," the organ of the Social Democratic Party of West Berlin, expressed opposition to "rejecting Moscow's new note without lengthy and careful consideration, as American newspapers often do." "Telegraf" stated, "In any case, without negotiations, it is absolutely impossible to eliminate tensions and the harmful division of Germany."

    The press office of the West German Social Democratic Party also issued a statement saying: "It would be foolish and irresponsible if the Western countries receiving the Soviet note continue to evade discussion and insist on arguments that are already politically and psychologically untenable." The press office emphasized that the greatest wish of the German people is to eliminate the division of Germany and achieve unification.

    The "Volksstimme" of Austria wrote: The Austrian government should support the Soviet note. Austria is among the countries most interested in establishing a collective security system as proposed by the Soviet Union. Therefore, the Austrian government's support for this proposal has significant international implications. The Presidium of the "Austrian People's Opposition Alliance" also issued a statement, demanding that the Austrian government formally express its approval of convening the conference proposed by the Soviet Union in order to peacefully resolve the Austrian question.

    France's "L'Humanité" said: The vast majority of public opinion in Western European countries recognizes the danger to world peace of dragging revanchist Germany into a military bloc aimed against other European countries, especially against the Soviet Union. Everyone recognizes the need to unite all European countries in a system of collective security. Continuing the current policy in Europe will only worsen the international situation and threaten the achievements made in Geneva on Asian issues. "Le Monde," an influential French bourgeois newspaper, said: "Undoubtedly, the Geneva Conference, in addition to the results already achieved, has greatly changed the situation. While many previous conferences had no results, the Geneva Conference has convinced people that negotiations are beneficial as long as the negotiating parties have a spirit of tolerance and a firm will to achieve success. There is no reason to believe that the preparation for reaching an agreement on the fate of Germany and Europe cannot achieve the same results and the same success. However, there is a necessary condition, which is not to take any steps beforehand that would hinder this matter from proceeding." This newspaper opposes the establishment of a "European Defense Community" and the arming of West Germany, as this would divide Europe into two hostile camps and complicate the international situation.

    Britain's "Daily Herald" condemned Dulles for rashly rejecting the Soviet note and pointed out: "If the Western countries think that the feelings of broad social circles can be ignored, they will make a fatal strategic error." The "Daily Mirror" said in an editorial, supporting Eden's words: "We will study Molotov's initiative for convening a new great power conference most thoroughly in consultation with our allies."

    Influential pro-government newspapers in India also endorsed the Soviet proposal for a European collective security system, believing that it was intended to further ease international tensions. The "Hindu," published in Madras, said: The principle of peaceful coexistence "is now a tangible reality, and the possibility of reaching an agreement with the Communists has been demonstrated in Geneva." The newspaper said: "The Western countries should accept the Soviet invitation and make a great effort to reach a decision that will promote German unification and guarantee European security."

    世界各国舆论欢迎苏联照会
    认为苏联关于欧洲集体安全的建议指出了巩固欧洲和平的现实道路
    【新华社二十九日讯】世界各国舆论欢迎七月二十四日苏联政府就欧洲集体安全问题致法、英、美三国政府的照会。
    民主德国的“新德意志报”指出：关于召开讨论欧洲集体安全问题的会议的建议，对于通过谈判来解决国际纠纷，是一个十分重要的贡献。在印度支那和平确立之后，欧洲爱好和平的人民有充分的权利要求建立欧洲安全体系。因此，苏联政府的建议得到德国人民极有力的支持。
    “柏林日报”和德国基督教民主联盟机关报“新时报”也热烈欢迎苏联的建议。
    捷克斯洛伐克“红色权利报”在社论里着重指出：欧洲的安全和互相谅解是不可能通过建立侵略性的军事集团和复活德国军国主义来达到的。
    日内瓦会议的结果表明：只有加强各国（不问其社会制度如何）的合作，通过协商，才能就各项国际争端达成协议。
    波兰“人民论坛报”强调：苏联建议的力量在于：这些建议指出了巩固欧洲和平的现实道路。
    罗马尼亚“火花报”说：使苏联建议的条约实现，将是欧洲各国之间进行广泛有效的合作的开端。
    匈牙利“自由人民报”的社论说：在日内瓦会议之后，美国因为侵略政策在亚洲遭到失败，想到欧洲来弥补。在这种情况下，把悬而未决的欧洲安全问题提出讨论，是比以前任何时候都要及时的任务。
    保加利亚“工人事业报”写道：当苏联政府在柏林外长会议上提出缔结保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约的建议之后，建立集体安全体系的问题就成了舆论界注意的中心。苏联政府的照会是实现苏联这个建设性提议的新贡献。
    阿尔巴尼亚“人民之声报”的社论指出：苏联的新建议不仅创立了今后商谈的基础，而且还打开了达到这个目的的道路。
    朝鲜“劳动新闻”的社论说：日内瓦会议就印度支那问题达成的协议促进国际紧张局势进一步缓和，从而不仅为解决亚洲的紧急问题创造了有利条件，而且对解决有关欧洲一系列尚未解决的问题增加了有利的因素。朝鲜人民热烈欢迎苏联政府的新的努力，希望保障集体安全的理想不仅在欧洲实现，而且也在亚洲实现。
    “民主朝鲜报”的社论说：特别值得注意的是：苏联政府的照会建议中华人民共和国派遣观察员列席讨论欧洲集体安全的会议。根据今天中华人民共和国在维护世界和平事业中所起的重大作用和这次日内瓦会议的经验，有中华人民共和国参加，就会增加大国之间达成协议的可能性。
    西柏林社会民主党的“电讯报”表示反对“不加以长时间的慎重考虑就拒绝莫斯科的新照会，像美国报纸常常做的那样”。“电讯报”说道，“总之，不谈判，是绝对无法消除紧张局势和德国的有害的分裂的。”
      西德社会民主党新闻处也发表声明说：“如果接到苏联照会的西方国家仍旧逃避讨论，并且坚持那种在政治上和心理上早已不能成立的论点，那就是愚蠢的和不负责任的。”新闻处强调：德国人民最大愿望是消除德国的分裂局面，实现统一。
    “奥地利人民之声报”写道：奥地利政府应当支持苏联的照会。奥地利是属于和苏联所建议的建立集体安全体系最有利害关系的国家之列的，因此，奥地利政府的支持这项建议，具有重大的国际意义。“奥地利人民反对派联盟”主席团也发表声明，要求奥地利政府正式表示赞同召开苏联所建议的会议，以便和平解决奥地利问题。
    法国“人道报”说：西欧各国绝大多数的舆论都认识到：把复仇主义的德国拖入旨在反对欧洲其他国家首先是反对苏联的军事集团里，会给全世界和平造成怎样的危险。大家都承认有必要把一切欧洲国家联合在集体安全的体系中。继续执行目前在欧洲的政策，只会使国际局势恶化，使在日内瓦就亚洲问题取得的成果受到威胁。有影响的法国资产阶级报纸“世界报”说：“毫无疑问，日内瓦会议除了已获得的结果以外，还大大地改变了局势。以前举行过许多会议都没有结果，而日内瓦会议却使人相信：只要谈判双方有忍让精神和取得成就的坚定意志，谈判是有好处的。没有任何理由认为，准备就德国和欧洲命运问题达成协议一事不可能获得同样的结果和同样的成就。不过有个必要条件，就是不要事先采取任何足以阻碍这件事情进行的步骤。”这家报纸反对建立“欧洲防务集团”和武装西德，因为这样会使欧洲分裂成两个敌对的阵营，并使国际局势复杂化。
    英国“每日先驱报”谴责杜勒斯轻率拒绝苏联的照会，并且指出：“如果西方国家竟认为广大的社会各界的情绪是可以不理睬的，它们就会在策略上犯致命的错误。”“每日镜报”在社论中赞成艾登的话：“我们将在和盟国的磋商中最周密地研究莫洛托夫关于召开新的大国会议的创议。”
    印度有影响的亲政府报纸也赞成苏联关于欧洲集体安全体系的建议，认为这个建议是为了进一步缓和国际紧张局势。在马德拉斯出版的“印度教徒报”说：和平共处的原则“现在已是可以感触到的现实了，和共产党达成协议的可能性已在日内瓦显示了出来”。这个报纸说：“西方国家应接受苏联的邀请，并且作出巨大的努力，来取得一个能促成德国统一和保证欧洲安全的决定。”
