Xinhua Bookstore Head Office convened a work conference on industrial and mining distribution in Beijing in mid-June, reviewing the work of Xinhua Bookstore in industrial and mining distribution in recent years and summarizing the preliminary experiences of industrial and mining distribution work.

In recent years, Xinhua Bookstore has begun to pay attention to industrial and mining distribution work, and the book distribution network in industrial and mining areas has also developed. As of the end of May this year, Xinhua Bookstore had established 164 branches in industrial and mining areas across the country, and 109 retail outlets and book kiosks under the branches. More than 50 specialized retail outlets selling science and technology books have also been added in various large and medium-sized cities. Through the above distribution network, Xinhua Bookstore has supplied tens of millions of books to industrial and mining areas in recent years. In Anshan City alone, 1.18 million books were supplied in 1953. In the Fufeng Mining Area of Hebei Province, from the first quarter of 1953 to the first quarter of 1954, more than 118,000 books were supplied by mobile supply alone. In their work, many branches have accumulated experience and improved their service levels. For example, some branches have established close contact with certain readers by inviting "reader consultants" or developing "basic readers," and by establishing a "reader contact card" system, asking them to guide the bookstore's purchasing work and assist the bookstore in conducting "stock appraisals" based on the needs of factories and mines for science and common knowledge books and production technology knowledge books. Some branches also pay attention to assisting factories and mines in establishing libraries; frequently providing mobile supply to worker dormitories; recommending books and developing subscriptions in conjunction with trade union propaganda work. These have played a significant role in improving the political, professional, and cultural level of employees, inspiring labor production enthusiasm, and improving the management of enterprises. However, there are still many shortcomings in the industrial and mining distribution work of Xinhua Bookstore: the important significance of industrial and mining distribution work is not sufficiently recognized; many branches are still unable to meet the needs of readers proactively, facing production, according to the characteristics of industrial and mining areas; and the blindness and one-sidedness in the work are still very serious.

The conference exchanged work experiences through sixteen typical reports. The conference emphasized that the entire store must attach importance to industrial and mining distribution work and establish the idea of serving socialist industrialization. Distribution work must face production and cooperate with the central work of factories and mines, not only to meet the needs of factory and mine cadres, but also to meet the needs of workers; it is necessary to do a good job in the distribution of science and technology books, but also to do a good job in the distribution of political, literary and other books, and prevent one-sided tendencies. The conference also pointed out that distribution work must rely on the masses; must adapt to the characteristics of industrial and mining areas, adopt a variety of supply methods, strengthen book publicity, and improve initiative in the work.

    新华书店总店召开工矿发行工作会议
    新华书店总店六月中旬在北京召开了工矿发行工作会议，检查了新华书店几年来的工矿发行工作，总结了工矿发行工作的初步经验。
    近年来新华书店已开始注意工矿发行工作，工矿区的书籍发行网也有了发展。到今年五月底止，新华书店已在全国工矿区建立了一百六十四个支店，并在支店之下设立了门市部和书亭一百零九处。在各个大、中城市也增设了若干专门出售科学技术书籍的门市部五十多处。通过以上的发行网，新华书店几年来对工矿区供应了数千万册书籍。仅鞍山市，一九五三年即供应了一百十八万册书籍。河北省峰峰矿区一九五三年第一季度到一九五四年第一季度，仅以流动供应方式所供应的书籍即达十一万八千多册。在工作中，许多支店积累了经验，提高了服务水平。例如有些支店用邀请“读者顾问”或发展“基本读者”的办法，用建立“读者联系卡”制度的办法，和某些读者紧密联系，请他们根据厂矿对科学常识书籍和生产技术知识书籍的需要情况，指导书店的进货工作和协助书店进行“存书鉴定”。有些支店并注意协助各厂矿建立图书室；经常到职工宿舍区流动供应；结合工会宣传鼓动工作推荐书籍和发展预订等。这些对于提高职工的政治、业务、文化水平，鼓舞劳动生产热情，改进企业的经营管理等等，起到不少作用。但是，新华书店在工矿发行工作中还存在着不少缺点：对工矿发行工作的重要意义还认识不足；很多支店还不能根据工矿区的特点，面向生产，主动满足读者需要；工作中的盲目性和片面性还很严重。
    会议通过十六个典型报告，交流了工作经验。会议着重指出：全店必须重视工矿发行工作，树立为社会主义工业化服务的思想。发行工作必须面向生产，配合厂矿的中心工作，既要满足厂矿干部的需要，也要满足工人的需要；既要做好科学技术书籍的发行工作，也要做好政治、文艺等书籍的发行工作，防止片面化的倾向。会议并指出：发行工作必须依靠群众；必须适应工矿区的特点，采用多种多样的供应方式，加强书籍宣传，提高工作中的主动性。　　　　（新华社）
