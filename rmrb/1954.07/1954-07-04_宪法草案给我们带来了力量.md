The Draft Constitution Gives Us Strength

    Common Aspirations
    The draft constitution has been published. Representatives of heroes, model workers, and meritorious personnel from the Northwest Military Region's institutions and troops stationed in Lanzhou met in the office building of the Military Region's Political Department. They discussed China's first constitution with joy and excitement.
    National combat hero Comrade Chen Quankui said: "In the old society, I was a child who herded cattle and begged for food. Herding cattle, begging for food, being beaten, being scolded, having nothing to eat or wear – that was my duty, which was also my right. At that time, landlords with five children could avoid military service, but my mother only had me, a sixteen-year-old orphan, and I was still forced to fill the ranks. After liberation, the dark days of cannibalism will never return. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the Chinese working people have truly turned over, stood up, and become masters of the country. Now, we have our own constitution. I will definitely take practical actions to defend it." Comrade Liu Zhanjiang spoke next. He was a veteran cadre who participated in the Second Domestic Revolutionary War, the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the Third Domestic Revolutionary War. Drawing on his rich experience in revolutionary struggle, he forcefully illustrated that the draft constitution published today is the victorious outcome of the Chinese people's long revolutionary struggle, bought with the lives of countless martyrs. He recounted an emotional story from the Second Domestic Revolutionary War period: "...In 1934, the Kuomintang bandits burned and looted Li Baijiahe in Qingjian, northern Shaanxi, killing many kind working people. Comrade Bai Xueshan, the commander of the Second Detachment of the local guerrillas, said with grief and excitement to the villagers: 'We must endure temporary suffering and persist in the struggle. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, we will definitely seize power. At that time, the people will have laws to punish these inhuman reactionaries.' Comrade Bai Xueshan cherished great ideals for the future and hatred for the enemy. He gloriously sacrificed himself in 1935 while fighting the Kuomintang reactionaries, but his ideals and will are also present in today's draft constitution." The heroes, model workers, and meritorious personnel became more and more enthusiastic in their discussion. Comrade Li Youcai, a second-class meritorious person in the "10,000 Li Safe Driving" campaign of a certain automobile regiment, stood up before others could sit down. He said loudly: "In the old society, the working people not only had no other rights, but they didn't even have the right to work. Workers were frequently unemployed in large numbers, and peasants were impoverished and bankrupt, wandering about without a place to live. But today, the working people not only have the right to work and the right to rest, but also the right to obtain material assistance." Comrade Kang Zhanlin said: "Thinking about the past makes me very sad. In the old society, I didn't even have a place to set foot, let alone 'freedom of residence.' For generations, my family had never read a book. Since the Party and Chairman Mao led us to turn over, we not only got housing, but even I, a blind man, became a 'primary school graduate.' Today, these rights that the working people have already enjoyed are clearly written in the draft constitution. There's nothing more to say. I must increase my vigilance a hundredfold, hold my gun tightly, and resolutely defend our motherland and our constitution."
    The heroes, model workers, and meritorious comrades present all enthusiastically spoke about their personal feelings. Almost every comrade's speech particularly emphasized Articles 20 and 103 of the draft constitution. Every comrade felt the glory and importance of their responsibility, and every comrade expressed their strength and determination to defend the security of the motherland and ensure the implementation of the constitution. (Zhao Dagang)
    Becoming a Loyal Defender of the Motherland
    Han Fengchun, a Korean Soldier of a certain unit of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army
    Since the Party Central Committee put forward the initial draft of the constitution, I have been looking forward to its publication every day. The Korean people, who have suffered many disasters, need a constitution to consolidate the great achievements we have gained under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao!
    I don’t know how many times I have thought about the past and present of our Yanbian Korean Autonomous Region: Before liberation, our place was a national hell. Under the oppression of Japanese imperialism, the land of the Korean people was arbitrarily plundered, and the people were innocently slaughtered. There were no hospitals, no schools, and even the language of our nation was not allowed to be used. Not to mention gatherings and associations, even if a few young people got together to talk quietly, there was a risk of being arrested. During the Kuomintang rule, the Korean people were equally discriminated against, with no freedom and living a slave-like life. But what about now? We have a national autonomous government; we have our own national primary schools, middle schools, and even Yanbian University has been established; we have well-equipped hospitals; we have land to cultivate and houses to live in; we live freely and happily in the national family just like our brotherly nationalities. I have changed from a child like a slave to a citizen of the great People's Republic of China, a soldier of the People's Liberation Army, and a glorious Communist Party member.
    On June 15th, the draft constitution was published! Suppressing the joy in my heart, I read it again and again. How exciting! The draft constitution states: "The People's Republic of China is a unified multi-ethnic country.
    All ethnic groups are equal. Discrimination against and oppression of any ethnic group are prohibited, as are acts that undermine ethnic unity.
    All ethnic groups have the freedom to develop their own languages and writing systems, and the freedom to maintain or reform their own customs and habits and religious beliefs.
    Regional autonomy is practiced in areas where minority nationalities live in concentrated communities. All national autonomous areas are inseparable parts of the People's Republic of China." The draft constitution not only consolidates the victories we have already achieved, but also demonstrates our common desire to build socialism.
    Therefore, in addition to sincerely supporting the draft constitution, I will devote all my energy to consolidating the unity of our national family and always be its loyal defender. The fact that the armies of all nationalities in the Soviet Union united and defeated German fascism is our best example. I will definitely learn the spirit of national soldiers in the Soviet army, stand firm in my position, implement the tasks stipulated in the constitution by setting an example, and strive to guarantee the implementation of the constitution and defend the security of the free and equal national family!
    If the Enemy Dares to Sabotage, We Will Resolutely Eliminate Them!
    Song Zhongwen, First-Class Meritorious Person of the Air Force of the Chinese People's Liberation Army
    On June 15th, as usual, we rushed to the airport at dawn to take over from the night shift and carry out the task of defending the motherland's airspace. Apart from those comrades who were ready to take off at any time, the rest of us gathered in the lounge to happily study tactics, exchange combat experience, and review ground subjects. At this time, the messenger ran towards us panting, shouting loudly from far away from the lounge: Good news! Our draft constitution has been published!
    Hearing the word "constitution," everyone excitedly crowded forward to grab the "Liberation Daily" printed with the big red headline. Some people were already reading, while others raised their heels, stretched their necks, and listened carefully. People closer followed the reading sound, greedily reading word by word. We not only wanted to eagerly see what rights we had written in the constitution, but also eagerly wanted to see what obligations and responsibilities the constitution stipulated for us! I think that whoever has fought for the birth of this constitution, whoever is determined to fight for the thorough realization of this constitution, at this moment, he cannot control his excited mood.
    As a pilot who has fought with the enemy, I remembered an aerial encounter with the enemy. At first, I only saw the shadows of two enemy planes reflected on the sea, and I thought they were fishing boats going out to sea. However, the soldiers guarding the motherland's airspace must not be careless, so I carefully observed, and only then determined that it was not a fishing boat, but enemy planes! I was above, and the enemy planes were below. The position between us quickly became a vertical angle. I charged, and the enemy's formation was disrupted, the leader and wingman separated. It looked like they were trying to attract my attention, while the other quietly circled behind me to attack me. I thought at the time: I'll shoot you down first, so you don't cause trouble and destruction. At this time, the enemy's leader flying in front of me saw that I was quickly catching up with him, so he hurried to lower his altitude and fly close to the sea. I dived down, pulled up; then dived down again, then pulled up again. I hit it, but I didn't see it explode. I angrily fired again, only to see a burst of sparks erupt, and the enemy plane fell into the sea! The other enemy plane, seeing the situation was not good, also slipped away. When I returned victoriously, when I looked at the tens of thousands of people in the city working and living happily in the high altitude, I felt a special joy. I felt that I had fulfilled a responsibility to the motherland. When I read this draft constitution now, the memories of past battles seem particularly close. The greater our construction achievements, the more the enemy will want to sabotage. I am determined to defend our great and lovable motherland in accordance with the tasks stipulated in the constitution for the people's army. If the enemy dares to sabotage, we will resolutely eliminate them!

### 宪法草案给我们带来了力量

    宪法草案给我们带来了力量
    共同的愿望
    宪法草案公布了，西北军区驻在兰州的机关、部队的英雄、模范和功臣的代表们，在军区政治部办公大楼里会面了。他们以欢欣鼓舞的心情谈论着中国人民的第一个宪法。
    全国战斗英雄陈全魁同志说：“在旧社会里，我是一个放牛讨饭的孩子，放牛，讨饭，挨打，挨骂，没吃没穿。这是我的义务，也就是我的权利。那时，地主有五个孩子可以不当兵，我妈只有我这样一个十六岁的孤儿，还硬被抓去顶了壮丁。解放以后，吃人的黑暗的日子是永远不会回来了，中国的劳动人民在共产党和毛主席的领导下，真正的翻了身，站起来了，自己做了国家的主人，现在，我们更有了自己的宪法。我一定要用实际行动来保卫它。”接着发言的是刘占江同志。他是参加过第二次国内革命战争、抗日战争和第三次国内革命战争的老干部，他以丰富的革命斗争经历，有力地说明了今天公布的宪法草案是中国人民长期革命斗争的胜利成果，是无数烈士用生命换来的。他激动地叙述着第二次国内革命战争时期的故事：“……一九三四年陕北清涧李白家河被国民党匪帮烧净抢光，许许多多善良的劳动人民同时被杀害了，当地的游击队第二支队支队长白雪山同志悲愤而激动地向老乡们说：‘我们要忍着暂时的痛苦，坚持斗争下去，我们在共产党的领导下，一定会取得政权，那时人民一定有法律来惩办这些惨无人道的反动派。’白雪山同志怀着对未来的远大理想和对敌人的憎恨，在一九三五年和国民党反动派作战中光荣地牺牲了，但是，今天的宪法草案里，也有着他的理想和意志。”英雄、模范、功臣们越谈越热烈，汽车某团万里安全行车的二等功臣李有才同志没等别人坐下，就站起来，他高声地说：“旧社会里，劳动人民不要说没有旁的权利，就是连劳动也没有权利，工人经常大批失业，农民贫困破产，流离失所。可是今天，劳动人民不但有劳动的权利，休息的权利，还有获得物质帮助的权利。”康占林同志说：“想起过去，真是叫我难过，我在旧社会里连个落脚的地点都没有，那里还有什么‘居住自由’；我们家几辈子人更没有念着一天书。自从党和毛主席领导咱们翻身以后，不但分到了住处，就连我这个睁眼瞎子，也成了‘高小学生’。今天，这些劳动人民已经享受到的权利又明明白白的写在宪法草案上。没啥说的，我一定要百倍地提高警惕，握紧枪杆，坚决保卫我们的祖国和我们的宪法。”
    到会的英雄、模范和功臣同志都热烈地诉说着自己切身的感受。差不多每一个同志的发言，都特别强调了宪法草案的第二十条和第一○三条，每一个同志都感到自己责任的光荣和重大，每个同志都表示了自己保卫祖国的安全，保证宪法实施的力量和决心。　（赵大纲）
    给祖国做一个忠贞的卫士中国
    人民解放军某部  朝鲜族战士  韩凤春
    自从党中央提出了宪法草案初稿以后，我就天天盼着公布。过去多灾多难的朝鲜族，是多么需要一部宪法把我们在共产党、毛主席领导下，获得的伟大胜利成果固定下来啊！
    不知道多少次，我想到我们延边朝鲜族自治区的过去和现在：解放前我们那里是一座民族地狱，朝鲜族人民在日本帝国主义的压榨下，土地被任意剥夺，人民被无辜屠杀，没有医院，没有学校，甚至连本民族的语言都不许用，不要说集会、结社，就是几个青年人凑到一块低声谈几句话，就有被逮捕的危险。在国民党统治时期，朝鲜族一样地被歧视，一样没有半点自由，一样过着奴隶般的生活。可是现在呢？我们有了民族自治政府；我们有了本民族的小学、中学，而且还成立了延边大学；我们有了设备完善的医院；我们有了土地种、有了房子住；我们和兄弟民族一样，自由幸福地生活在民族大家庭里。我从一个像奴隶牛马一样的孩子，变成了伟大的中华人民共和国的公民、人民解放军战士，光荣的共产党员。
    六月十五日，宪法草案公布了！我压抑着心头的喜悦一遍遍地读着它。多么叫人兴奋啊！宪法草案上写着：“中华人民共和国是统一的多民族的国家。
    各民族一律平等。禁止对任何民族的歧视和压迫，禁止破坏各民族团结的行为。
    各民族都有发展自己的语言文字的自由，都有保持或者改革自己的风俗习惯和宗教信仰的自由。
    各少数民族聚居的地方实行区域自治。各民族自治地方都是中华人民共和国不可分离的部分。”宪法草案不仅把我们已经获得的胜利果实固定了下来，而且显示了我们建设社会主义的一致愿望。
    因此，我除了竭诚地拥护宪法草案以外，并将以全部精力，来巩固我们的民族大家庭的团结，永远做它的忠贞的卫士。苏联各民族的军队，团结一致，战胜了德国法西斯的事实，是我们最好的榜样。我一定学习苏军中民族战士的精神，站稳自己的岗位，以身作则地执行宪法规定的任务，为保障宪法的实施，为保卫自由平等的民族大家庭的安全而努力奋斗！
    敌人敢来破坏，就把它坚决消灭！
    中国人民解放军  空军一等功臣  宋中文
    六月十五日，我们像平常那样，天刚发亮，就紧张地赶到机场去接替夜班，执行保卫祖国领空的任务。除开那些时刻准备待命出发的同志，其余的人，都聚集在休息室里愉快地研究战术，交谈作战经验，复习地面学科。这时通讯员喘着气向我们跑来了，还在离休息室老远的地方，就高声呐喊起来：好消息！我们的宪法草案公布了！
    听到“宪法”这两个字，大家就兴奋地拥上前去争看那张印着红色大标题的“解放日报”。有人已经读起来，有人抬起了脚后跟，伸长了脖子，仔细听着，离近一点的人随着朗读的声音，贪婪地一字一字往下看着。我们不只要急于看看我们有那些权利写在宪法上，我们还渴望看看宪法给我们规定了什么义务和责任！我想，只要是为这部宪法的诞生奋斗过的人，只要是决心为这部宪法的彻底实现奋斗的人，在这一刻，他就决不能控制住自己激动的心情。
    作为一个飞行员和敌人进行过战斗的我，想起了和敌人的一次空中遭遇，最初，我只发现两架敌机映到海上的影子，我还以为那是出海的渔船。可是，警卫祖国领空的战士，决不能有任何粗心大意，我就进行细细地观察，这时才确定了那不是渔船，而是敌机！我在上边，敌机在下边。我们之间的位置很快就变成了垂直角度。我一冲，敌人队形乱了，长机和僚机分开了。看那样子，是企图一个来吸引我的注意力，一个悄悄绕到后面来打我。我那时想：先把你打下去再说，免得你捣乱破坏。这时，飞在我前面的敌人的长机看见我飞快地把他追上了，就赶忙降低高度，贴着海面飞。我冲下去，拉起来；又冲下去，又拉了起来。打是打着了，可就是没有看见它爆炸。我愤怒地又射击起来，才看见一阵火花迸发，敌机掉下海去了！另一架敌机见势不佳也溜跑了。当我胜利返航时，当我在高空看着城市里成千成万的人正在愉快的劳动和生活时，我感到一种特别的喜悦，我觉得自己为祖国尽了一分责任。当我现在读着这部宪法草案时，过去战斗的回忆显得特别亲切。我们的建设成绩越大，敌人就越想来破坏。我决心按照宪法给人民军队规定的任务保卫我们伟大可爱的祖国，敌人敢来破坏，就把它坚决消灭！
