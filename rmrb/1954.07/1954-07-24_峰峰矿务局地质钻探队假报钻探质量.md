Peak Mine Bureau Geological Drilling Team Falsely Reports Drilling Quality

The Geological Exploration Team of the Peak Mine Bureau has a total of more than twenty drilling rigs. Among them, nine drilling rigs have been engaged in organized and planned false reporting of drilling quality for a long time to fraudulently obtain state bonuses. It was not until May of this year that the assistant Li Xiuchuan and recorder Zhang Qing of the 28th Detachment had a dispute over altering the coal core, which exposed the matter. Now, after thorough investigation by the mine area party committee and relevant departments, the situation has been fully clarified.

In order to fraudulently obtain bonuses, the machine team leaders of these nine drilling rigs resorted to coercion and bribery of recorders, unauthorized alteration of reports, smashing and stretching core samples, and even creating fake core samples and other vile methods. The four detachments were the most serious. For example, Yuan Yunqi, the leader of the 17th Detachment, falsely reported his achievements three times around November 1953, smashing and increasing the core length by one meter. Once, after the recorder had written the daily report, he saw that the quality was not good enough and immediately ordered the recorder to change the report. At that time, the recorder refused his illegal "order" and criticized him, but Yuan Yunqi not only did not accept it, but personally changed the report. He often said, "Whether you make money or not depends entirely on the recorder." In this way, they fraudulently obtained more than two million yuan in bonuses. In November 1953, the 18th Detachment, when drilling well 410, found that the quality was not good. Stretching the broken core samples still did not meet the specifications, so they unscrupulously clumped the rock powder, drilling mud, steel grit, and cotton wool from the powder collecting pipe into fake core samples more than 400 centimeters long in an attempt to pass them off as core samples. Li Junsheng, another team leader of the 420-hole drilling rig of the same team, forced the recorder Fan Jinzhou to change a 130-centimeter core to 160 centimeters. When Fan Jinzhou refused to change it, Li criticized Fan at the life review meeting for "poor labor attitude." The machine used this method to "over-fulfill the task" every month from the start of drilling in September 1953 to January 1954, fraudulently obtaining nearly ten million yuan in bonuses and being rated as a "model drilling rig." Huang Qingwen, the acting machine leader of the 24th Detachment, deliberately stretched the core by 100 centimeters because the core recovery rate was low when the April task was nearing completion. On April 23, the original length of the core was 1 meter and 50 centimeters, and the form had been filled out. However, Huang saw that the recovery rate was low, so he personally smashed the 200-centimeter long core and said, "I'm willing to make a mistake." He ordered the recorder to measure it again and re-write the report, resulting in an over-reporting of 540 centimeters. Under the joint leadership of machine leader Fang Zixiu and team leader Zhen Youcun of the 28th Detachment, the core in the report of March 25 was over-reported by one meter. At the end of March, because the footage exceeded the quota by 64 meters, and the core was still short by 600 centimeters, Fang masterminded and planned to transfer the footage of March 31 to April 1, 800 centimeters, and reported "over-fulfillment of the task," fraudulently obtaining more than two million yuan in bonuses.

The reasons for the above-mentioned serious situations are, on the one hand, that these drilling personnel are of poor quality, have low awareness, and lack a sense of responsibility for national construction. On the other hand, the leaders of the Peak Mine Bureau lack sufficient understanding of the importance of the accuracy of geological data, only pursue progress, regardless of quality; in their work, they neglect to conduct regular political and ideological education for employees, and one-sidedly use bonuses to encourage employees' production enthusiasm. Due to insufficient understanding of the importance of geological data, leading cadres at all levels only asked, "How is the task completed?" "How is the material consumption?" when they went to the work area to inspect the work. However, no one cared about the various erroneous phenomena such as coal cores being placed everywhere and exposed to the wind and rain. Some drilling rigs focus on rushing progress in the first and middle ten days of the month, advancing the core tube straight for six meters without extracting the core, allowing it to wear; and then rush the quality in the last ten days of the month, extracting the core after drilling one meter or half a meter. What is particularly serious is that when the 19th Detachment was drilling hole 416, the large coal of more than four meters was reduced to two meters. Knowing that more than two meters had been lost, the leaders still issued a bonus of more than one million yuan because they "over-fulfilled the task." This has further encouraged grassroots cadres to long-term neglect quality, falsely report achievements, and fraudulently obtain bonuses. (Sun Rong)

    峰峰矿务局地质钻探队假报钻探质量
    峰峰矿务局地质处钻探队一共有二十余台钻机，其中有九台钻机长期有组织、有计划地假报钻探质量，骗取国家奖金。直到今年五月，二十八分队助手李秀川和记录员张清因更改煤心发生争吵，这件事才被揭露出来。现在经过矿区党委和有关部门深入检查，情况已全部弄清。
    这九台钻机的机班长们为了骗取奖金，竟采取对记录员威吓利诱，擅改表报，打碎拉长岩心，甚至制造假岩心等恶劣手段。其中最严重的有四个分队。如十七分队班长袁运起一九五三年十一月前后共假报了三次成绩，先后打碎和增长岩心一公尺。有一次记录员写好了日报表，他一看质量不够，即命令记录员更改报表，当时记录员拒绝了他这个违法的“命令”，并向他提出批评，但袁运起不但不接受，反而亲自把表报改了。他经常说：“赚钱不赚钱，全在记录员。”就这样前后骗取了奖金二百多万元。十八分队一九五三年十一月在打四一零眼时因质量不好，将碎岩心拉长仍不合规格，便不择手段地将取粉管内的岩粉、钻泥、钢砂和棉丝等团成假岩心四百多公分长，企图冒充岩心。该队四二零孔钻机另一班长李俊生，硬叫记录员范金舟将一百三十公分的岩心改成一百六十公分，范金舟不肯改，李就在生活检讨会上批评范“劳动态度不好”。该机就用这样的办法，自一九五三年九月开钻到一九五四年一月，月月“超额完成任务”，骗取了奖金近千万元，并被评为“模范钻机”。二十四分队代机长黄青文在四月份任务将近完成时，因岩心采取率低，竟故意将岩心拉长一百公分。四月二十三日岩心原长一公尺零五十公分，并已填好表格，但黄一看采取率低，就亲自动手将其中长二百公分的岩心打碎，并说：“我豁出犯错误。”命令记录员重新再量一次，重改了表报，结果多报了五百四十公分。二十八分队在机长房自修与班长甄有村共同主持下，将三月二十五日表报中的岩心多报一公尺。三月底，因进尺超额六十四公尺，而岩心尚差六百公分，于是在房的主谋策划下把三月三十一日进尺拨到四月一日八百公分，上报“超额完成任务”，骗取了奖金二百多万元。
    产生上述种种严重情况的原因，一方面是由于这些钻探人员品质不好，觉悟不高，对国家建设工作极其缺乏责任心，另一方面，则是由于峰峰矿务局领导上对地质资料正确性的重要意义认识不足，只追求进度，不顾质量；在工作中忽视对职工进行经常的政治思想教育，片面地以奖金来鼓励职工的生产情绪。由于对地质资料的重要性认识不足，各级领导干部到工区检查工作时，开口只问：“任务完成怎样？”“材料消耗怎样？”而煤心岩心到处乱放，任其遭受风吹雨打的种种错误现象，却无人过问。有的钻机上中旬专门突击进度，岩心管直进六公尺也不提取岩心，任其磨损；到下旬再来突击质量，钻进一公尺半公尺就提出取岩心。尤其严重的是对十九分队在四一六孔钻进时，将四公尺多的大煤打成二公尺，明知打丢了二公尺多，但领导上却因其“超额完成任务”，仍然发给奖金一百多万元，这样就更助长了基层干部长期忽视质量，假报成绩，骗取奖金的恶劣行为。      （孙容）
