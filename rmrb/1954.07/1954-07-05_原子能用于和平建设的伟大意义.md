    The Great Significance of Atomic Energy for Peaceful Construction
    The Soviet Council of Ministers issued a communique stating that on June 27, 1954, the Soviet Union completed the construction of the first industrial atomic power station and has begun generating electricity. In human history, this is the first time that atomic energy has been used for industrial production, thus enabling mankind to take a major step forward in applying atomic energy to peaceful purposes. This is not only a major achievement in modern science and technology, but also opens up broad prospects for mankind to use atomic energy to create prosperity and a happy life, and therefore has extremely significant meaning. Peace-loving people all over the world warmly welcome the Soviet Union's new achievements in using atomic energy for peaceful construction and feel extremely excited.
    People know that the method of producing atomic energy has long been discovered. However, atomic energy has mainly been used by imperialist countries for the manufacture of atomic weapons. Among the countries that have mastered atomic power, only the Soviet Union has consistently been committed to using atomic energy for peaceful needs and resolutely opposed the use of atomic weapons. Comrade Malenkov pointed out in his report to the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union: "Although the Soviet state has mastered the practical possibilities of producing atomic energy, it is eager to use this new type of energy for peaceful purposes, for the happiness of the people, because this use of atomic energy can infinitely expand mankind's control over the spontaneous forces of nature, giving mankind enormous possibilities to increase productivity, make progress in technology and culture, and increase social wealth." This great task put forward by the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is being gradually realized due to the continuous efforts of Soviet scientists and engineers under the leadership of the Communist Party and the government of the Soviet Union. After completing the first industrial atomic power station with a generating capacity of 5,000 kilowatts, Soviet scientists and engineers are designing a project for an industrial atomic power station with a generating capacity of 50,000 to 100,000 kilowatts. Atomic energy has unlimited development prospects for peaceful construction. The Communist Party and the government of the Soviet Union have always attached importance to the development of the peaceful uses of atomic energy and will make atomic energy play an increasingly important role in the cause of building communism.
    From the discovery of radioactive phenomena to the formulation of practical methods for obtaining atomic energy, science has come a long way. In this process, Soviet science has achieved brilliant accomplishments. In the short few years after the war, the Soviet Union has successively discovered and mastered the production methods of atomic and hydrogen weapons for the purpose of defending the socialist motherland and world peace, and now it has first mastered the method of using atomic energy to produce electrical energy, which irrefutably proves that advanced Soviet science is in the first place in the world. The rapid progress of Soviet science shows the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system. In the capitalist world, monopoly capitalists are very afraid that the progress of science and technology will threaten their monopoly profits and try every possible means to use science for war purposes. Some American scientists who serve American monopoly capital, such as Harvard University professor Kircaferls and other atomic physicists, even drafted bills to prohibit the use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes and widely publicized them. This fully illustrates how corrupt the capitalist system has become and how the science of the capitalist world has embarked on the road to its own destruction.
    Using atomic energy for peaceful industrial purposes will undoubtedly accelerate the construction of communism in the Soviet Union and greatly strengthen the people's welfare in socialist countries. This is a major contribution to the cause of world peace and the progress of human society.
    While vigorously developing the peaceful uses of atomic energy, the Soviet Union is also actively fighting for the prohibition of atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction. Since the war, the Soviet Union has continuously proposed suggestions to prohibit the use, manufacture, and stockpiling of atomic weapons; peace-loving people from all countries and many international organizations have continuously issued appeals for the prohibition of atomic weapons. Under the just propositions of the Soviet Union and the calls of peace-loving people all over the world, the ruling group in the United States is in a very embarrassing situation. U.S. President Eisenhower's speech on the issue of atomic weapons on December 8 last year only advocated providing a small portion of atomic materials to an "International Atomic Energy Agency" hosted by the United Nations, without prohibiting or restricting the production, expansion, and use of atomic weapons in any way. Therefore, the U.S. President's so-called plan for "international sharing of atomic materials" is equivalent to directly authorizing the production of atomic weapons. This cannot help but make people suspect that its actual purpose is only to paralyze the vigilance of people of all countries against the atomic war conspiracy of U.S. imperialism.
    As everyone knows, the ruling group in the United States has always used atomic energy for war purposes and has used the atomic arms race as the basis for its diplomatic blackmail policy. Although they have long lost their monopoly on atomic weapons, they are still intensifying the expanded production of atomic weapons and the planning of atomic warfare. It is estimated that in 1953, the total investment in the U.S. atomic industry reached 8.3 billion U.S. dollars, and will increase to about 10 billion U.S. dollars by the end of the current fiscal year. The industry that manufactures atomic weapons has become one of the largest sectors of the U.S. economy. U.S. monopoly capital groups such as Morgan, DuPont, and Rockefeller, the largest consortia, are seizing maximum profits by relying on the annually increasing orders for atomic weapons and government investment. It is precisely because of this that the U.S. ruling group is doing its best to obstruct reaching an agreement on an international control plan to prohibit atomic weapons, fearing that reaching this agreement would cause U.S. monopoly capitalists to lose huge profits and ease international tensions.
    Over the years, discussions in United Nations institutions on international control plans to prohibit atomic weapons have failed to make progress because the United States has insisted on its infamous Baruch Plan, which aims to strengthen the United States' "atomic military advantage." The U.S.-Soviet talks on atomic energy issues have also been unable to achieve results as a result. After the Berlin Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference reached an agreement on negotiating substantial arms reduction, the U.S. ruling group not only had no intention of fulfilling its obligations, but also rejected the Soviet Union's proposal for an international convention on the prohibition of atomic weapons, arms reduction, and the establishment of international supervision at the recently held meeting of the Subcommittee of the United Nations Disarmament Commission; moreover, it conducted a series of large-scale hydrogen bomb explosion tests and clamored about a so-called new military strategy of launching atomic warfare, intimidating and blackmailing peace-loving countries and peoples. The arrogant policy adopted by the U.S. ruling group seriously threatens world peace and security and has aroused unease and public condemnation in various countries.
    However, the Washington adventurers have miscalculated. The atomic diplomacy policy pursued for several years has not gained anything for Washington, but has repeatedly run into snags. The Soviet Union's development in the field of atomic armaments has completely bankrupted U.S. atomic blackmail, and the U.S. atomic war adventure plan will only put itself and the entire capitalist system in a dangerous predicament. Now, the Soviet Union's achievements in vigorously applying atomic energy to peaceful uses have further shattered the lies of the war maniacs about the so-called "communist threat" and the inability of atomic energy to be used for peaceful construction, and will make even greater changes in the comparison of actual strength between the two camps. All this cannot but greatly encourage the confidence of the people of all countries in defending peace and promote the further development of the peace movement. It is no accident that world public opinion has expressed joy and excitement over the establishment of the Soviet Union's first atomic power station; while the international war forces headed by the United States appear panic-stricken.
    The Soviet Union's consistent peaceful foreign policy will gain greater trust and support around the world. The movement against war and striving for the prohibition of atomic weapons and arms reduction will increasingly attract millions of people to unite more closely. This new development in the international political situation will more forcefully defeat the U.S. policy of "proceeding from strength." The reactionary forces who harbor fanatical fantasies about a devastating atomic war will make themselves more isolated.
    The 600 million Chinese people express warm congratulations on the Soviet Union's brilliant achievements in using atomic energy for peaceful purposes and on the Soviet Union's improvement in the level of modern science and technology in the cause of building communism. We are even more confident in dedicating ourselves to the cause of world peace and the great construction of the socialist industrialization of the motherland. The development of the Soviet Union's top-notch advanced science and technology, and the new upsurge of the national economy that follows, will surely greatly promote the development of mutual assistance and cooperation between China and the Soviet Union and the entire peace and democracy camp. Chinese scientists further realize that science that serves peace and the people's cause has unlimited development prospects, and only this kind of science is needed by the people, and the contribution of this kind of science to human progress will be inestimable. Chinese scientists should strive to learn from the advanced experience and service spirit of Soviet scientists, and improve our scientific and technological level more quickly, and train a large number of scientific and technological talents in our country. In this way, the socialist industrialization construction of our country will advance rapidly.
    American atomic science brings the threat of death to all mankind in the world. Soviet atomic science opens up unlimited bright prospects of happiness and prosperity for mankind. Capitalism, as it develops to this stage, is barbarism, is regression, is destruction. Only communism is the banner of unlimited improvement of mankind's material welfare, unlimited development of culture, and unlimited progress of science. The great achievements of the Soviet government, the Soviet people, and Soviet scientists and engineers use facts to explain to all mankind that only communism can save all mankind from the barbarism and destruction of capitalism. The event of capitalism giving way to communism is increasingly becoming a matter of urgent need for all mankind for their own survival.

### 原子能用于和平建设的伟大意义

    原子能用于和平建设的伟大意义
    苏联部长会议发表公报，一九五四年六月二十七日，苏联完成了第一个原子能工业电力站的建设工作，并已开始发电。在人类历史上，这是第一次把原子能用于工业生产，从而使人类在把原子能应用于和平目的方面前进了一大步。这不仅是近代科学技术的一个重大的成就，并为人类利用原子能创造繁荣和幸福生活开辟了广阔的前景，因而具有极其重大的意义。全世界爱好和平的人们都热烈欢迎苏联在利用原子能于和平建设方面所取得的这个新的成就，并感到极大的兴奋。
    人们知道，生产原子能的方法早已被发现了。但是原子能曾经主要是被帝国主义国家用于原子武器的制造。在已经掌握了原子威力的国家中，只有苏联一贯地致力于利用原子能于和平的需要，而坚决反对使用原子武器。马林科夫同志在苏联共产党第十九次代表大会的报告中就曾指出：“苏维埃国家虽然掌握了生产原子能的实际可能性，但亟愿把这种新型的能量用于和平目的，为人民谋幸福，因为这样利用原子能可以无限地扩展人类对自然界自发力量的控制，使人类有巨大的可能来提高生产力，在技术和文化上求进步，并增加社会财富。”苏联共产党第十九次代表大会所提出的这个巨大的任务，由于苏联科学家和工程师在苏联共产党和政府的领导下的不断努力，正在逐步实现着。在完成了发电能力为五千瓩的第一个原子能工业电力站之后，苏联科学家和工程师正在设计发电能力为五万到十万瓩的原子能工业电力站的工程。原子能用于和平建设将有无限的发展前途。苏联共产党和政府一贯重视发展原子能的和平用途，并将使原子能在建设共产主义事业中起日益重要的作用。
    从放射性现象的发现时起，到制定取得原子能的实际方法止，科学已走了很长的一段路程。在这个过程中，苏联的科学取得了辉煌的成就。苏联在战后的短短的几年中，为了保卫社会主义祖国和世界和平的目的已先后发现并掌握了原子武器和氢武器的生产方法，现在又首先掌握了用原子能生产电能的方法，这就无可辩驳地证明了先进的苏联科学已居于世界第一位。苏联科学的飞跃进步显示了社会主义制度的无比优越性。在资本主义世界，垄断资本家们十分害怕科学技术的进步威胁他们的独占利润，而千方百计地把科学用于战争目的。为美国垄断资本服务的一些美国科学家们，如哈佛大学教授凯卡佛尔斯以及其他一些原子物理学家甚至曾经拟制了禁止把原子能用于和平目的的法案，并加以广泛宣扬。这就充分地说明了资本主义制度已经到了如何腐朽的地步，资本主义世界的科学已是如何地走上自己毁灭的道路了。
    把原子能利用于和平工业方面，这无疑将加速苏联共产主义的建设，并将大大加强社会主义国家的人民福利。这对于全世界的和平事业和人类社会的进步是一个重大的贡献。
    在大力发展原子能的和平用途的同时，苏联并为禁止原子武器、氢武器及其他大规模毁灭性武器而积极奋斗。战后以来，苏联曾不断提出禁止使用、制造和储存原子武器的建议；各国爱好和平人民及许多国际组织都曾不断发出要求禁止原子武器的呼吁。在苏联的正义主张和全世界爱好和平人民的呼声下，美国统治集团的处境非常尴尬。美国总统艾森豪威尔于去年十二月八日发表的关于原子武器问题的演说，只主张将一小部分原子物资提供给由联合国主持的一个“国际原子能机构”，而对于原子武器的生产、扩充和使用都不加以禁止或任何的限制。因而，美国总统的这个所谓“原子物资国际共储”的计划，等于直接准许原子武器的生产。这不能不使人怀疑，它的实际的目的，只是在于麻痹各国人民对于美帝国主义原子战争阴谋的警惕。
    人所共知，美国统治集团一直把原子能用于战争目的，并把原子军备竞赛作为外交上讹诈政策的基础。虽然他们早已失掉了对原子武器的垄断地位，但他们对原子武器的扩大生产和原子战争的策划，仍在加紧进行。据估计，在一九五三年，美国原子工业中的投资总数已达八十三亿美元，到现行财政年度结束时将增加到约一百亿美元。制造原子武器的工业，已成了美国经济的最巨大的部门之一。美国垄断资本集团如摩根、杜邦、洛克菲勒等最大的财团，依靠逐年增大的原子武器订货和政府投资而攫取着最大限度的利润。正是因为这样，美国统治集团竭力阻挠就禁止原子武器的国际管制计划达成协议，唯恐达成这个协议会使美国垄断资本家们失去巨大的利润，使国际紧张局势得到缓和。
    历年来联合国机构对禁止原子武器的国际管制计划的讨论，已因美国坚持它的臭名远扬的目的在于加强美国“原子军备优势”的所谓巴鲁克计划，而未能有所进展。美苏两国关于原子能问题的会谈，也因而无法取得结果。柏林四国外长会议达成了关于谈判大量裁减军备问题的协议后，美国统治集团不仅无意履行自己的义务，并在最近举行的联合国裁军委员会小组委员会会议上，拒绝了苏联关于禁止原子武器、裁减军备和建立国际监督的国际公约的建议；而且大举进行氢弹爆炸的一系列试验，大肆叫嚣发动原子战争的所谓新军事战略，对爱好和平的国家和人民进行恫吓和讹诈。美国统治集团所采取的这种狂妄政策，严重地威胁着世界的和平和安全，引起了各国的不安和公众的谴责。
    但是，华盛顿冒险家们失算了。数年来推行的原子外交政策，丝毫没有使华盛顿得到什么，反而使它一再碰壁。苏联关于原子军备方面的发展，使美国原子讹诈彻底破产，美国原子战争的冒险计划只有使得它自己和整个资本主义制度临于危险的绝境。现在，苏联大力地把原子能用于和平用途的努力的成就，进一步粉碎了战争狂徒们的所谓“共产主义的威胁”和原子能不能用于和平建设之类的谎言，并将使两个阵营之间的实际力量的对比关系发生更大的变化。这一切都不能不大大地鼓舞各国人民保卫和平的信心，推动和平运动的进一步发展。世界各国公众舆论对苏联第一个原子电力站的建立表示欢欣鼓舞；而以美国为首的国际战争势力则显得惊惶失措，这完全不是偶然的。
    苏联一贯奉行的和平外交政策，将在世界范围内得到更大的信任和支持。反对战争、争取禁止原子武器和裁减军备的运动，将日益吸引千百万人更紧密地团结起来。国际政治形势的这一新的发展，将会更加有力地使美国“从实力出发”的政策遭到更大的挫败。对毁灭性的原子战争寄予狂热的幻想的反动势力将使自己更陷于孤立。
    六亿多的中国人民，对苏联使用原子能于和平用途的光辉成就，对苏联在建设共产主义事业中的现代科学技术水平的提高，表示热烈的庆贺。我们更加信心百倍地来致力于世界和平事业和祖国社会主义工业化的巨大建设。苏联头等的先进的科学技术的发展，及随之而来的国民经济的新的高涨，必将大大促进中苏两国和整个和平民主阵营的互助合作的发展。中国科学家们进一步认识到，为和平及人民事业服务的科学是有无限的发展前途的，只有这种科学才是人民所需要的，这种科学对人类进步的贡献将是无可估量的。中国科学家们应该努力学习苏联科学家的先进经验和服务精神，把我们的科学技术水平更快地提高起来，把我国的科学技术人才大量地培养出来。这样，我国的社会主义工业化建设就会迅速前进。
    美国的原子科学给全世界人类带来死亡的威胁。苏联的原子科学给人类开辟无限光明的幸福与繁荣的前景。资本主义发展到现在就是野蛮，就是倒退，就是毁灭。只有共产主义，才是人类物质福利无限提高，文化无限发展，科学无限进步的旗帜。苏联政府、苏联人民、苏联科学家工程师们的伟大成就，以事实来向全人类说明，只有共产主义才能从资本主义的野蛮与毁灭中拯救全人类。资本主义让位给共产主义这件事，日益成为全人类为了自己的生存而迫切需要的事情了。
