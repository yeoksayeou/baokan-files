    Severely Punish Criminals Who Disrupt Social Order

    In recent years, public security organs in various localities, while suppressing counter-revolutionary sabotage activities, have also legally arrested and punished a large number of criminals who disrupt social order, and have educated and reformed a large number of hooligans, vagrants and other bad elements. This has played a significant role in consolidating social security. However, in the past year or so, criminal cases in some areas have increased again, and in some individual areas, criminal activities are even rampant. This must continue to be curbed.

    Among these criminals, some are counter-revolutionaries who escaped the net, some are hostile class elements such as unlawful landlords, some are bad elements left over from the old society such as hooligans, vagrants, habitual thieves, swindlers, and un-reformed former puppet military and political personnel scattered in various places. They individually or in organized groups engage in criminal activities such as theft, fraud, robbery, arson, murder, and rape of women in urban and rural areas, seriously disrupting social order in some areas and endangering the interests of the state and the people. According to surveys and statistics from various localities, most of the criminal cases currently occurring in cities are theft and fraud cases, with cases of theft and destruction of state-owned industrial and mining enterprises, cooperatives, state organs, and school public property being the most numerous. Thieves in Wuhan were so rampant that they used large carts and wooden boats to transport large quantities of steel bars and other materials from Hanyang No. 1 Factory and Wuhan No. 3 Engineering Company. Criminal cases occurring in rural areas mainly involve damaging agricultural production and water conservancy facilities, stealing and destroying public property of cooperatives, stealing and destroying state-stored grain and railway telecommunications equipment, as well as arson, poisoning, and murdering revolutionary cadres and mass activists. In Raoyang and Ding Counties, Hebei Province, nine agricultural production cooperatives experienced three arson incidents and eight theft cases in 1953 alone. These situations fully demonstrate that the criminal behaviors occurring in various localities, whether committed by remaining counter-revolutionaries or by bad elements such as hooligans, vagrants, and habitual thieves, are essentially aimed at sabotaging China's socialist industrialization and socialist transformation.

    However, today some people in our public security organs and people's courts do not fully recognize the serious harm of criminal offenses. When dealing with criminal cases, they often one-sidedly emphasize education and reform, neglecting due punishment, and even for criminal offenders who repeatedly refuse to mend their ways after education, they only release them after education or impose only short-term imprisonment. This makes those incorrigible hooligans, vagrants, and habitual thieves dare to continue their evil deeds, and also gives counter-revolutionaries an opportunity to exploit, seriously damaging the interests of the state and the people and arousing dissatisfaction among the people. The increase in criminal cases in many places in recent years is inseparable from this erroneous thinking and practice of one-sidedly emphasizing education and reform and neglecting due punishment.

    It must be recognized that a considerable number of criminal offenders are counter-revolutionaries who have escaped the net and hostile class elements such as unlawful landlords. Among the forty-four criminal offenders recently captured in Yangchun County, Guangdong Province, counter-revolutionaries accounted for 10 percent and hostile class elements accounted for 36 percent. The situation in other places is generally the same. This fully demonstrates that the current criminal activities, to a large extent, are political sabotage activities with counter-revolutionary objectives. As for the hooligans, vagrants, and habitual thieves among criminal offenders, their destructive behaviors also damage the interests of the state and the people, and in essence, are also a kind of counter-revolutionary criminal behavior. We should remember that Lenin called swindlers and hooligans left over from the old society "public enemies of the people, public enemies of socialism, and public enemies of the workers," advocating "no leniency whatsoever" towards these bad elements. He said: "These enemies should be specially monitored by the entire people, and when they slightly violate the rules and laws of socialist society, they should be ruthlessly punished. Any weakness, any wavering, any pity shown in this regard is a great crime against socialism." Therefore, the idea and practice of neglecting due punishment for criminal behavior is completely wrong and must be quickly corrected.

    In state organs, state-owned enterprises, cooperatives and other units, some people do not fully recognize the serious harm of criminal offenses. They neither educate their staff to raise their vigilance and prevent theft and other sabotage incidents, nor take effective measures to plug various loopholes and establish and improve anti-special agent, anti-theft and fire prevention systems. This gives a few counter-revolutionaries and bad elements such as hooligans an opportunity to exploit. A habitual thief in Wuhan, Cheng Zhi, said after being arrested: "Public property is plentiful, easy to steal, valuable, no one cares, and the investigation is not strict." This shows how serious the bureaucracy of our state organs and enterprise personnel is, in their negligence and indifference to public property.

    In order to further consolidate social security, ensure national economic construction, and protect the safety of the people's lives and property, public security organs in various localities should strengthen the struggle against criminal behavior and treat it as an important task. First of all, through careful investigation and research, closely relying on the masses, concentrating main forces to investigate and solve cases, and through typical examples, strengthen publicity and education to the masses, so that every household and every person can always raise vigilance, strictly prevent theft incidents, and actively assist public security organs and boldly report criminal offenders. In handling criminal cases, it is necessary to correctly implement the policy of combining punishment with education and reform. Those who engage in counter-revolutionary activities in the form of criminal offenses should be punished in accordance with the regulations on punishing counter-revolutionaries; for general criminal offenders, they should be sentenced to imprisonment and forced labor reform according to the severity of the crime; the organizers of habitual theft, habitual thieves and criminal gangs, as well as big hooligan bosses, should be severely punished, even to the point of capital punishment. At the same time, those in charge of all organs and enterprises who are derelict in their duties and cause criminal cases should also be disciplined. Only in this way can we more effectively combat criminal activities.

### 严厉制裁扰乱社会治安的刑事罪犯

    严厉制裁扰乱社会治安的刑事罪犯
    最近几年来，各地人民公安机关在镇压反革命破坏活动的同时，还依法逮捕和惩办了大批扰乱社会治安的刑事罪犯，教育和改造了大量的地痞、流氓等坏分子。这在巩固社会治安上是起了很大作用的。但是，近一年多来，部分地方的刑事犯罪案件又有增加，个别地方的刑事犯罪活动甚至还十分猖狂。这是必须继续加以制裁的。
    在这些刑事罪犯中，有一些是漏网的反革命分子，有一些是不法地主等敌对阶级分子，有一些是旧社会遗留下来的地痞、流氓、惯盗、惯窃、骗子手等坏分子，以及尚未得到改造的、流散在各地的伪军政人员。他们在城市和农村中个别地或有组织地从事盗窃、诈骗、抢劫、纵火、凶杀以及强奸妇女等罪恶活动，严重扰乱了部分地区的社会治安，危害了国家和人民的利益。据各地的调查统计，目前在城市中所发生的刑事案件，大多数是盗窃、诈骗案件，其中又以盗窃和破坏国营工矿企业、合作社、国家机关和学校公共财产的案件为多。武汉的盗窃分子竟至猖狂到使用大车和木船运走了汉阳一厂和武汉市第三工程公司的大量钢筋等物资。在农村中发生的刑事犯罪案件，主要是破坏农业生产和水利设施，盗窃和毁坏合作社的公共财物，盗窃和破坏国家储存的粮食和铁路电讯器材，以及放火、放毒和杀害革命干部和群众积极分子。河北省饶阳、定县有九个农业生产合作社，在一九五三年内就发生了坏分子纵火事件三起和盗窃案八起。这些情况充分说明，各地所发生的刑事犯罪行为，不论是残余反革命分子所为，或地痞、流氓、惯盗、惯窃等坏分子所为，其实质都是破坏我国的社会主义工业化和社会主义改造的。
    但是今天在我们的人民公安机关和人民法院中，有一些人对刑事犯罪的严重危害性是认识不足的。他们在处理刑事犯罪案件的时候，往往片面地强调教育改造，忽略了应有的惩罚，甚至对于屡教不改的犯罪分子，也只是教育释放，或者仅判处短期徒刑。这就使得那些破坏成性的地痞、流氓、惯盗、惯窃等坏分子敢于继续为非作恶，同时也给了反革命分子以可乘之隙，严重地损害了国家和人民的利益，引起了人民群众的不满。近年来许多地方的刑事犯罪案件所以又有增加，是和这种片面强调教育改造、忽略应有惩罚的错误思想和作法分不开的。
    必须看到有相当多的刑事犯罪分子，是漏网的反革命分子和不法地主等敌对阶级分子。广东省阳春县最近捕获的四十四名刑事犯罪分子中，反革命分子占百分之十，敌对阶级分子占百分之三十六。其他地方的情况也大体相同。这就充分说明，目前的刑事犯罪活动，在很大的程度上就是以反革命为目的的政治破坏活动。至于在刑事犯罪分子中的地痞、流氓、惯盗、惯窃等坏分子，他们的破坏行为同样损害了国家和人民的利益，实质上也是一种反革命的犯罪行为。我们应该记得列宁把旧社会遗留下来的骗子、流氓等叫做“人民公敌，社会主义底公敌，劳动者底公敌”，主张对这些坏分子“不容有丝毫宽恕”。他说：“对于这些敌人应当由全体人民加以特别监视，当他们稍一违犯社会主义社会底规则和法令时，便应无情地加以惩治。在这方面表示任何软弱，任何动摇，任何悯惜，都是对社会主义的莫大罪行。”因此，对于刑事犯罪行为忽略了应有的惩罚的思想和作法是完全错误的，必须迅速加以纠正。
    在国家机关、国营企业部门和合作社等单位中，还有一些人对刑事犯罪的严重危害性认识不足。他们平日既不教育所属的工作人员提高警惕，严防盗窃等破坏事件，也不采取有效措施，以堵塞各种漏洞，建立和健全防特、防盗和防火等制度。这就给了少数反革命分子和地痞、流氓等坏分子以可乘之机。武汉市的一个惯窃程智在被捕后说：“公家东西多，好偷，值钱，没人心疼，追查不严。”这就说明了我们国家机关和企业部门人员麻痹大意和对公共财产漠不关心的官僚主义是多么严重了。
    为了进一步巩固社会治安，保障国家的经济建设，保护人民生命财产的安全，各地人民公安机关应该加强对刑事犯罪行为的斗争，把它当做一项重要的任务。首先要通过周密的调查研究，紧密地依靠人民群众，集中主要力量进行侦查破案，并通过典型的事例，加强对群众的宣传教育，使每家每人经常提高警惕，严防盗窃事件，并积极协助人民公安机关，大胆地检举刑事犯罪分子。在刑事犯罪案件的处理上，必须正确地执行惩罚与教育改造相结合的政策。凡是以刑事犯罪形式进行反革命活动者，应按惩治反革命条例论处；对于一般的刑事犯罪分子，应根据犯罪情节的轻重分别处以徒刑，强迫劳动改造；对于惯盗、惯窃以及犯罪集团的组织者和大流氓头子，应从重惩处，直至处以极刑。同时，对于一切机关、企业等单位负责人员因疏于职守而发生刑事案件的也要给以处分。只有这样才能更有效地打击刑事犯罪活动。
