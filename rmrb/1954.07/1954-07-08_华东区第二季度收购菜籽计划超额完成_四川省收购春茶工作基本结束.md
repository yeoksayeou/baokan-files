The East China region's farmers in oilseed rape growing areas are actively selling rapeseed to the state. By June 20th, Zhejiang Province had procured approximately 60 million jin of rapeseed, Jiangsu Province had procured over 50 million jin, and Anhui Province, which started procurement work earlier, had completed 95% of its annual plan. The East China region as a whole had exceeded its second-quarter rapeseed procurement plan by the end of June.

This year, the state's advance purchase measures for rapeseed have strongly supported farmers' production. After harvesting rapeseed, the vast majority of farmers have actively fulfilled their advance purchase contracts and sold surplus rapeseed to support national economic construction. In Taixian County's Gangkou Town, Jiangsu Province, Chen Dianzhu's mutual aid team not only promptly sold over 17,000 jin of rapeseed to the state according to the advance purchase contract but also sold the surplus 1,400 jin to the state. The Guiyang District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Guichi County, Anhui Province, pre-purchased over 529,000 jin of rapeseed from farmers. By June 15th, it had procured over 571,000 jin of rapeseed, and the recovered pre-purchase deposits accounted for 99.65% of the original amount invested. In mid-June, farmers in Qingyang County sold all the rapeseed to the supply and marketing cooperative according to the original 900-plus advance purchase contracts and returned all the deposits.

The spring tea procurement work in Sichuan Province has now basically concluded. The China Tea Company Sichuan Provincial Branch has procured more than twice as much spring tea this year compared to last year. As of June 10th, the province had completed 58% of its annual fine tea procurement plan, with export red tea completing 105% of the procurement plan.

This year's spring tea procured in Sichuan Province includes the nationally renowned "Mengshan Tea," as well as the "Qingcheng Tea" from Guanxian, "Hongqing" from Qionglai, and "Kezi" from Jiajiang, which are popular among the people of Sichuan and other regions. Some of these teas will be transferred to the Northwest and North China regions in their original form, while others will be processed into scented tea to meet the needs of the people of Sichuan and shipped to Xikang, Yunnan, and other places. The red tea will be processed for export, and this batch of tea is expected to earn the country 2,300 tons of steel or 46 tractors.

    华东区第二季度收购菜籽计划超额完成
    四川省收购春茶工作基本结束
    华东区种植油菜地区的农民积极把菜籽卖给国家。到六月二十日，浙江省收购菜籽约六千万斤，江苏省收购了五千多万斤，收购工作开展较快的安徽省完成全年计划的百分之九十五。华东全区第二季度收购菜籽的计划，在六月底以前已超额完成。
    今年国家预购菜籽的措施有力地支持了农民的生产，广大农民在收获菜籽以后，都积极履行预购合同，并出售多余的菜籽，支持国家经济建设。江苏省泰县港口镇陈殿珠互助组除按照预购合同及时卖给国家一万七千多斤菜籽外，还把多余的一千四百多斤菜籽也卖给了国家。安徽省贵池县白洋区供销合作社共向农民预购菜籽五十二万九千多斤，到六月十五日，收购的菜籽已有五十七万一千多斤，收回的预购定金占原投放数的百分之九十九点六五。青阳县农民在六月中旬即按照原来签订的九百余份预购合同，把菜籽全部售给供销合作社，并归还了全部定金。　　（袁凌　蒋杰三等）

    四川省春茶收购工作现已基本结束。中国茶业公司四川省公司今年收购的春茶比去年增加一倍以上。到六月十日止，全省已完成全年细茶收购计划的百分之五十八，其中外销红毛茶已完成收购计划百分之一百零五。
    今年四川省收购的春茶中，有驰名全国的“蒙山茶”，有四川等地人民喜爱的灌县“青城茶”、邛崃“烘青”、夹江“颗子”等茶叶。这些茶叶一部分将以原茶调往西北、华北，一部分将加工为花茶，供应四川人民的需要和运往西康、云南等地。红毛茶将经过加工出口外销，这批茶叶约可为国家换回钢材二千三百吨或拖拉机四十六台。
