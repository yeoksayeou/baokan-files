Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, July 11th: The Northwest region is actively preparing to develop new bases for textile industrial raw materials such as cotton and flax, in order to expand the planting area of cotton and flax and supply the needs of China's cotton and flax textile industry.

The Northwest region is vast and rich in textile industrial raw material resources, with many varieties, and there are many large tracts of wasteland that are extremely suitable for cultivating cotton and flax. Now, relevant departments of the Central People's Government and the agricultural, water conservancy and other departments under the Northwest Administrative Committee, as well as specialized companies such as cotton yarn and cloth and native products, have dispatched special personnel or jointly formed survey organizations to conduct investigation and research work. Among them, the New Cotton Area Survey Team departed on July 6th to conduct surveys in large tracts of wasteland suitable for cotton planting in the Hexi Corridor of Gansu Province, the Manas River Basin of Xinjiang Province, and areas such as Korla, Kuqa, and Turpan. The Korla Cotton and Flax Experimental Farm in Xinjiang Province is vigorously carrying out cultivation experiments of long-staple cotton. The preparatory office of the Northwest Agricultural Science Research Institute is actively studying the soil and climate of the loess plateau in the Guanzhong area of ​​Shaanxi Province, in order to solve the technical problems of dryland cotton planting.

In addition, a kind of perennial plant, wild hemp, grows in large quantities in the vast grasslands of the lower reaches of the Tarim River and Peacock River in Xinjiang Province, the Hexi Corridor in Gansu Province, and the Ejin Banner in Ningxia Province. This wild hemp has the characteristics of being wind-resistant, drought-resistant, cold-resistant, and alkali-resistant, and has extremely strong reproductive capacity. Last year, the Agriculture and Forestry Bureau of the Northwest Administrative Committee organized farmers in Xinjiang to try peeling one thousand catties, which were tested for spinning by the East China Textile Department in Shanghai. The fiber length averaged 2.25 inches, which is twice as long as cotton fiber, and the tensile strength is equivalent to six times that of cotton. After bleaching, it is snow-white, supple, and has a luster and softness surpassing ramie. Recently, surveyors are actively conducting investigations and research on the yield, growth and other conditions of wild hemp, and the agricultural and native product marketing departments are preparing to focus on mobilizing farmers to pick and peel this autumn. This year, the Korla Cotton and Flax Experimental Farm in Xinjiang Province also plans to conduct wild hemp cultivation experiments.

The cultivation area of sesame in the Northwest is relatively large, and there is also great potential in production. In the three counties of the Xihai Gu Hui Autonomous Region of Gansu Province alone, the planting area this year has reached more than 400,000 mu, and there are more than 1 million mu of fallow land that can also be planted with sesame. However, in the past, farmers were accustomed to only harvesting seeds for oil extraction, and the hemp skin was discarded or rarely used. This year, the agricultural department will focus on helping farmers in sesame producing areas to conduct trial peeling. It is estimated that each mu of sesame can yield 20 to 30 catties of hemp skin in addition to seeds.

Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, July 11th: Xinjiang Province will reap a bumper harvest of over 9,238,000 mu of winter and spring wheat. According to the inspection and field observation of the Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the Provincial People's Government in key areas, it is estimated that the average yield per mu of wheat field can increase by about 5% compared with last year. If no unexpected disasters occur before the wheat harvest, the total wheat output of the province this year will be about 1.7 billion catties. At present, harvesting has begun in the Turpan Basin and Minfeng, Shache, Artux and other counties in southern Xinjiang Province.

In the past, most farmers of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang did not have the habit of planting winter wheat, but now the area of ​​winter wheat has gradually increased. Although individual areas have suffered natural disasters such as freezing, drought, and pests and diseases to varying degrees this year due to the influence of climate, under the leadership of the People's Government, farmers of all ethnic groups have carried out prevention and control in a timely manner and strengthened field management, ensuring the growth of wheat.

Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, July 10th: The Ili River banks, known as the granary of Xinjiang Province, are expected to reap a bumper harvest of more than 2 million mu of crops. The earlier planted wheat and rapeseed can be harvested in late July. According to many elderly farmers in the area, this year is the first bumper harvest year since liberation on both banks of the Ili River. At present, the Ili River is showing a busy scene of the upcoming summer harvest. Farmers of all ethnic groups are actively preparing draft animals, carts and various farm tools needed for the summer harvest. The local agricultural machinery station has dispatched technicians to counties such as Suiding to repair horse-drawn wheat harvesters for farmers of all ethnic groups free of charge. The 20,000 sickles and a part of horse-drawn wheat harvesters and other agricultural tools supplied by the trade department of the Ili Prefecture, as well as various small agricultural tools processed and manufactured by the supply and marketing cooperatives of various counties, are being continuously transported to the countryside.

    西北积极准备开拓棉麻等纺织原料新基地
    新疆省九百多万亩冬春小麦丰收在望
    【新华社西安十一日电】西北区积极准备开拓棉、麻等纺织工业原料的新基地，以便扩大棉麻种植面积，供应我国棉麻纺织工业的需要。
    西北地区辽阔，纺织工业原料的资源丰富，品种也多，且有许多极适宜栽培棉、麻的大片荒地。现在中央人民政府有关部门和西北行政委员会所属农业、水利等部门以及花纱布、土产等专业公司已分别派专人或联合组成勘查组织，进行调查研究工作。其中新棉区勘查组已在七月六日出发，到甘肃省河西走廊、新疆省玛纳斯河流域、库尔勒、库车、吐鲁番等适宜植棉的大片荒地地区进行勘查。新疆省库尔勒棉麻试验场，正大力进行长绒棉的栽培试验工作。西北农业科学研究所筹备处正积极研究陕西省关中地区黄土塬上的土壤、气候，以便解决旱地种棉的技术问题。
    此外，新疆省塔里木河和孔雀河中下游的广大草原、甘肃省河西走廊以及宁夏省的额济纳旗等地，大量生长着一种宿根植物的野麻。这种野麻有抗风、抗旱、抗寒、抗碱的特性，繁殖力极强。西北行政委员会农林局去年在新疆产地组织农民试剥了一千斤，经华东纺织部门在上海试行纺织，纤维长度平均二点二五吋，比棉纤维长一倍，拉力相当于棉花的六倍。漂炼后雪白柔韧，光泽柔软胜过苎麻。最近勘查人员正在积极进行有关野麻的产量、生长情况等的调查研究工作，农业和土产运销部门准备今秋重点发动农民进行采剥。今年新疆省库尔勒棉麻试验场还准备进行野麻栽培试验的工作。
    胡麻在西北的栽培面积较大，在生产上也有巨大的潜力。仅甘肃省西海固回族自治区三个县，今年的播种面积就达四十万亩以上，还有一百多万亩轮歇地也都可播种胡麻。但农民过去习惯只收籽榨油，对麻皮废弃或很少利用。今年农业部门将重点帮助胡麻产区农民进行试剥，估计每亩胡麻除收籽外，还可剥二三十斤麻皮。
    【新华社乌鲁木齐十一日电】新疆省九百二十三万八千多亩冬、春小麦将获得丰收。根据省人民政府农林厅在各重点地区的检查和田间观察，估计每亩麦田平均比去年约可增产百分之五，如麦收前不发生意外灾害，全省今年小麦总产量约为十七亿斤。现在，吐鲁番盆地和新疆省南部民丰、莎车、阿图什等县已开始收割。
    过去新疆各族农民大多没有种冬麦的习惯，现在冬麦面积已逐渐增加。今年虽然因为气候的影响，个别地区曾发生不同程度的冻、旱及病虫等自然灾害。但在人民政府领导下，各族农民及时进行防治和加强田间管理，保证了小麦的生长。
    【新华社乌鲁木齐十日电】号称新疆省粮仓的伊犁河两岸，两百多万亩农作物丰收在望。种得较早的小麦、菜籽，七月下旬就可开始收割。据当地许多老年农民谈，今年是伊犁河两岸解放以来第一个大丰收的年成。现在伊犁河畔已呈现出一片夏收即将到来的繁忙景象。各族农民正积极准备夏收需用的耕畜、大车和各种农具。当地的农业机器站已派技术员分赴绥定等县，免费为各族农民修理马拉割麦机。伊犁专区贸易部门负责供应的两万把镰刀和一部分马拉割麦机等农具，以及各县供销合作社负责加工打制的各种小型农具，正源源运往农村。
