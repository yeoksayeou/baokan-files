    Livestock Survival Rate Reaches Ninety-Six Percent in Tuoli County, Xinjiang Province
    Tuoli County, Xinjiang Province, has achieved great success in animal husbandry production this year. Over 97,000 young animals of various types have been produced, with a survival rate of 96 percent. Currently, herders have begun shearing summer wool and are conducting mating work for large livestock.
    This year, Tuoli County suffered severe snow disasters, which greatly threatened animal husbandry production. However, thanks to the active leadership of the Party and the People's Government in leading herders to fight against natural disasters and timely guiding herders to transfer to spring pastures, livestock not only did not suffer significant losses but also generally suffered fewer losses than in previous years. For example, in the Fourth District this year, livestock losses during the pasture transfer were reduced by 52.8 percent compared to last year. During lambing, measures were taken such as dividing large herds for grazing, managing small lambs in separate pens, and organizing herders to help each other in lambing and raising lambs on a voluntary basis, implementing artificial assistance in delivery and artificial feeding, which ensured the safety of both mother animals and young animals.
    This year, Tuoli County also attached great importance to veterinary prevention and the elimination of wolf threats. According to incomplete statistics, by mid-May, folk veterinary teams alone had cured more than 1,500 livestock using various methods. Veterinarians in the Second and Fourth Districts also gave preventive injections to more than 3,500 livestock, which greatly reduced livestock mortality and the spread of diseases. Cadres in various districts and townships also actively led herders in hunting wolves. By mid-May, the county had killed more than 300 wolves, completing 75 percent of the annual wolf hunting plan. In addition, ten pastures were restored, which can graze 15,000 livestock.

    新疆省托里县幼畜成活率达百分之九十六
    新疆省托里县今年畜牧业生产已获得了很大成绩。各种牲畜共产幼畜九万七千多只，成活率达到百分之九十六，目前，牧民们开始了剪收夏毛和进行大家畜交配工作。
    今年托里县雪灾严重，对畜牧业生产的威胁很大。但是，由于党和人民政府积极领导牧民和自然灾害进行了斗争，适时的领导牧民转入了春牧场，因而，使牲畜不但没有遭到大的损失，而且比往年还普遍减少了损失。如第四区今年在转移牧场中，牲畜损失比去年就减少了百分之五十二点八。在接羔中，由于采取了大畜（大群）分群牧放，小羔分圈管理，并在自愿的基础上，组织牧民互助接羔、育羔，实行人工助产、人工喂奶等办法，保证了母畜和幼畜的安全。
    今年托里县对于兽医防治和消灭狼害也非常重视。根据不完全的统计：到五月中旬，光是民间兽医小组，就用各种方法治好了牲畜一千五百多头，第二、四两区的兽医还给三千五百多头牲畜进行了预防注射。因而大大减少了牲畜的死亡和病疫的流行。各区乡干部还积极领导牧民打狼，全县到五月中旬已经打狼三百多只，完成了全年打狼计划的百分之七十五。此外，还恢复了十处草场，可以牧放一万五千头牲畜。
