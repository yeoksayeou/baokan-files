    Commemorating the First Anniversary of the Korean Armistice
    – Defend the Korean Armistice Agreement, Continue to Strive for a Peaceful Resolution of the Korean Issue
    Yang Yong, Deputy Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers
    The heroic Korean and Chinese People's Armies, under the leadership and command of Marshal Kim Il-sung and Commander Peng Dehuai, and with the enthusiastic support of the Korean and Chinese people, as well as peace-loving people around the world, resolutely resisted the American-led aggressor army, fought arduously for three years, and finally achieved the great victory of the Korean Armistice on July 27, 1953. It has been a full year now.
    July 27th is a day worth commemorating for us, because it is our victory day. The purpose of our Chinese People's Volunteers crossing the Yalu River to fight alongside the Korean People's Army was to stop the war of aggression and resolve the Korean issue peacefully. The conclusion of the armistice agreement was a major step towards this goal. Therefore, over the past year, our entire army has resolutely implemented the armistice order of Marshal Kim Il-sung and Commander Peng Dehuai, ensuring the accurate implementation of the armistice agreement.
    Over the past year, our army has also actively helped the Korean people restore and rebuild their peaceful lives, which had been severely damaged by the war. First, we helped to quickly restore railway transportation in northern Korea, and helped repair many water conservancy projects and buildings such as schools and hospitals that were destroyed by enemy aircraft during the war. In addition, we generally helped residents near our station build houses and carry out various productive labor activities, and dispatched engineering units to participate in the reconstruction of Pyongyang. These activities further strengthened our unity with the Korean people, deepened the friendship between the Chinese and Korean people, and demonstrated the love of the Korean and Chinese people for peaceful labor.
    In stark contrast to our army's strict implementation of the armistice agreement are the enemy's constant violations of the armistice agreement. According to statistics as of June 14th, enemy aircraft have violated our airspace 309 times, involving 709 sorties, since the armistice. Enemy military personnel have illegally crossed the military demarcation line into our area 80 times, fired guns and artillery into the demilitarized zone 57 times, and repeatedly sent special agents into the rear of our army to gather intelligence and carry out sabotage activities. In particular, it should be pointed out that the enemy has been holding more than 48,000 captured personnel from our side. These violations of the armistice agreement by the enemy show that they are deliberately trying to keep the Korean armistice in an unstable state.
    At the highly anticipated Geneva Conference, the United States blatantly disregarded the good wishes of the people of the world for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, as well as the reasonable proposals of Korea, China, and the Soviet Union for reaching a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. They stubbornly obstructed and sabotaged the conference, preventing the Geneva Conference from reaching an agreement on the Korean issue. The United States even unreasonably rejected a statement of reconciliation proposed by the delegations of Korea, China, and the Soviet Union regarding guaranteeing the peaceful state of Korea and continuing to work for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. From this, it can be seen that the United States has no sincerity in peacefully resolving the Korean issue. On the contrary, it is vigorously instigating the organization of a so-called Pacific anti-communist military group, and directing Syngman Rhee to clamor that "the armistice agreement is invalid," "the South Korean government is not bound by it," and "a new policy of unifying Korea by advancing north," while also attempting to abolish the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in order to transport large quantities of weapons and ammunition to expand the Syngman Rhee puppet army. All of this shows that the United States is still trying every means to keep the Korean armistice agreement in an unstable state and refuses to resolve the Korean issue through peaceful consultation. The Korean armistice is in danger of being broken at any time.
    Faced with such a situation, all commanders and fighters of our army are guarding their positions with high vigilance, and are stepping up training, striving to improve their military, political, and cultural levels, and enhance their combat effectiveness, so as to cooperate with the Korean People's Army to be ready to crush any enemy provocation and attack, and ensure the continued implementation of the armistice agreement. We believe that we have the power to achieve the Korean armistice, and we have even more power to continue to consolidate it and strive for a final peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, in order to protect the socialist construction of our motherland and lasting peace in the Far East.

### 纪念朝鲜停战一周年——保卫朝鲜停战协定，继续争取朝鲜问题的和平解决

    纪念朝鲜停战一周年
    ——保卫朝鲜停战协定，继续争取朝鲜问题的和平解决
    中国人民志愿军副司令员　杨勇
    英勇的朝中人民军队，在金日成元帅和彭德怀司令员领导和指挥下，在朝中人民以及全世界爱好和平人民的热烈支援下，坚决抗击以美国为首的侵略军，艰苦卓绝作战三年，终于在一九五三年七月二十七日取得了朝鲜停战的伟大胜利，到现在整整一年了。
    七月二十七日这个日子，对于我们是一个值得纪念的日子，因为它是我们的胜利日。我们中国人民志愿军跨过鸭绿江、协同朝鲜人民军作战的目的，就在于制止侵略战争，以和平方式解决朝鲜问题，停战协定的达成正是向着我们的这个目标迈了重大的一步。所以，一年来我们全军上下都坚决执行了金日成元帅和彭德怀司令员的停战命令，保证了停战协定的确切实施。
    一年来，我军还积极地帮助朝鲜人民恢复和重建被战争严重破坏了的和平生活，首先是帮助迅速地恢复了朝鲜北部的铁路交通，并帮助修复了许多战时被敌机炸毁的水利工程，以及学校医院等建筑物。此外还普遍地帮助了驻地附近居民修建住屋，以及进行各种生产劳动，并派遣了工兵部队参加了平壤市的重建工作。这些活动进一步加强了我们和朝鲜人民的团结，加深了中朝人民间的友谊，也显示了朝中人民对和平劳动的热爱。
    和我军严格执行停战协定恰成明显对照的，是敌人方面不断破坏停战协定的行为。截至六月十四日的统计，停战以来敌机违反协议侵入我领空三百零九批，七百零九架次，敌军人员非法越过军事分界线进入我区八十次，用枪炮向非军事区射击五十七次，并多次派遣特务进入我军后方，刺探情报，进行破坏活动。尤其应当指出的是，敌方一直扣留着我朝中被俘人员四万八千余人。敌方这种种的违反停战协定的行为，表明了他们是蓄意使朝鲜停战处于不稳定的状态。
    在举世瞩目的日内瓦会议上，美国悍然不顾全世界人民要求和平解决朝鲜问题的善良愿望，和朝、中、苏关于达成和平解决朝鲜问题的合理建议，蛮横地进行阻挠破坏，使日内瓦会议关于朝鲜问题的讨论没有达成协议，美国连朝、中、苏三国代表团提出的关于保证朝鲜的和平状态，以及继续为和平解决朝鲜问题而努力这样一个表示和解愿望的声明，都横蛮无理地拒绝了。由此可见，美国丝毫没有和平解决朝鲜问题的诚意，相反的，它正极力策动组织所谓太平洋反共军事集团，并指使李承晚叫嚣“停战协定已经无效”、“南朝鲜政府不受约束”和“北进统一朝鲜的新政策”，同时还企图取消中立国监察委员会，以便大量运进武器军火，扩充李承晚伪军。这一切都说明，美方仍在千方百计使朝鲜停战协定处于不稳定状态，拒绝和平协商解决朝鲜问题，朝鲜停战有随时被破坏的危险。
    面对着这样的局势，我军全体指挥员、战斗员都以高度的警惕性守卫着自己的阵地，并加紧训练，努力提高自己的军事、政治、文化水平，提高战斗力，协同朝鲜人民军随时准备粉碎敌人的任何挑衅和进攻，保证停战协定的继续实施。我们相信，我们既有力量取得了朝鲜的停战，我们也更有力量把它继续巩固下去，并争取最后和平解决朝鲜问题，以保卫我们祖国的社会主义建设和远东的持久和平。
