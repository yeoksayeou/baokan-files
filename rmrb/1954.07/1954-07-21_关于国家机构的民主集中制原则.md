On the Principle of Democratic Centralism in State Organs
Jun Wei

Democratic centralism is not only the organizational principle of the working-class party but also the organizational principle of state organs under the leadership of the working class. Both the Soviet system and the people's democratic system are established according to the principle of democratic centralism and are both forms of political system based on democratic centralism.

As an organizational principle of state organs, democratic centralism encompasses two equally important aspects. First, democracy mainly refers to: (1) the working class and the laboring people participate in state management and truly become the masters of the state; (2) the highest state power organs and local state power organs are elected by the people; (3) the entire people formulate the constitution; (4) the state administrative organs are responsible to and report their work to the state power organs. Second, centralism mainly refers to: (1) the highest state power organ is the sole organ for exercising state legislative power; (2) strict adherence to the constitution and laws; (3) the binding force of decisions of higher-level state organs on lower-level state organs; (4) the implementation of the system of the minority subordinating to the majority, the lower level subordinating to the higher level, and the local subordinating to the central in state organs. This kind of democratic centralism is centralization on the basis of democracy and democracy under the guidance of centralization. According to the principle of democratic centralism, state organs form a complete unity from bottom to top and from top to bottom.

Democratic centralism is fundamentally opposed to the bourgeois separation of powers. These two different organizational principles of state organs represent two historical eras. The dictatorship of the proletariat or the people's democratic dictatorship is the *form* of a state led by the working class (the essence of the state), and democratic centralism is the organizational principle of state organs that adapts to this *form*.

The earliest embryonic form of this brand-new thing, democratic centralism, was the Paris Commune of 1871. The question that Marx found from the experience of the Paris Commune was: what should the proletarian revolution use to replace the bourgeois state machine, and what should the new type of state system be in the period of transition from capitalism to socialism? The experience of the Paris Commune proved that the working class could not simply seize the existing state machine but had to smash the old bourgeois state machine and establish the dictatorship of the proletariat. At that time, Marx once instructed that the most suitable state system for the dictatorship of the proletariat was not a parliamentary republic, but a political organization in the style of the Paris Commune. Marx called this style "the political form that was ultimately discovered, which can enable the laboring masses to achieve economic liberation." But unfortunately, Marx did not continue to develop this instruction in his own works, so this instruction was forgotten for many years afterward.

Based on the experience of the two great revolutions in Russia in 1905 and February 1917, and drawing on the lessons of the Paris Commune, Lenin believed that the state system of the dictatorship of the proletariat was not a parliamentary system but a Soviet system. As early as April 1917, Lenin emphasized: "The essence of the Commune lies not in what the bourgeoisie usually seeks, but in that it established a special form of state. This state already exists in Russia, namely, the Soviet of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies." Stalin, the great successor of Lenin, said in "Foundations of Leninism": "The Soviet Republic is that political form which has been sought for a long time and finally found, within the scope of which the economic liberation of the proletariat, the complete victory of socialism, should also be realized. The Paris Commune is the embryo of this form. The Soviet regime is the development and completion of this form." Facts have proved that the Soviet system and the subsequent people's democratic system were established according to the principle of democratic centralism of Marxism-Leninism.

Regarding the bourgeois separation of powers, Lenin once said that it was a historical progress compared with the previous feudal states. The idea of the bourgeois separation of powers in the early eighteenth century reflected the progressive demands of the bourgeoisie at that time to oppose feudal autocracy and seize power. At that time, the state was the state of the feudal monarch, and the monarch monopolized the administrative, legislative, and judicial powers of the whole country. The bourgeoisie opposed this feudal dictator and advocated dividing part of the power from the emperor and giving it to themselves, for example, first wanting to divide the legislative power, and then striving for the judicial power. At that time, the separation of powers meant: making the legislative power belong to the organ representing "society," and the administrative power belonging to the monarch. Thus, the principle of separation of powers became a program for changing the absolute monarchy into a limited constitutional monarchy. In the early and mid-eighteenth century, from Locke's principle of separation of powers to Montesquieu's "The Spirit of the Laws," they were all advocating this doctrine of separation of powers. The principle of separation of powers was once one of the main principles of the American Constitution of 1787 and the French Constitution of 1791. After the bourgeoisie acquired state power, these demands were modified and used as the organizational principles of bourgeois state organs to adapt to and consolidate its *form*—the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. After the bourgeoisie mastered state power, the principle of separation of powers lost its original social content. At this time, its significance was: (1) to reconcile the contradictions and conflicts within the bourgeoisie; (2) to play a deceptive role to the oppressed masses of people and conceal the essence of the bourgeois dictatorship.

What is this so-called "democratic" "separation of powers" actually like? Lenin said it right in his book "State and Revolution": "Look at any parliamentary country, from America to Switzerland, from France to England, Norway, etc., where the real 'state' work is done behind the scenes, is carried out by the cabinet, the government offices, and the general staff. In the parliament, they only engage in empty talk to fool the 'common people'."

Let us look at the situation of the bourgeois "separation of powers" evolving into the era of imperialism. First, take Britain as an example. In eighteenth-century Britain, it had been determined that the cabinet should be responsible to and supervised by the House of Commons. But from the end of the nineteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth century, this situation underwent fundamental changes. The cabinet excluded the role played by the parliament and actually occupied a dictatorial position. It not only led the country's internal affairs and diplomacy but also guided the parliament's legislative work and sometimes even surpassed the parliament to become an organ exercising legislative power. The result is: the executive power is strengthened, the legislative power is weakened, and the cabinet manipulates the legislation of the parliament.

Take the United States as an example. The current United States has completely abandoned the banner of "democracy" and "freedom" of the era of the War of Independence in the eighteenth century, trampled on the constitutional provisions of the separation of powers that were once declared "sacred," and openly embarked on the path of fascism. Among the three organs of the president, Congress, and the court stipulated in the US Constitution, the monopoly bourgeoisie of Wall Street especially favors the president and gradually concentrates all state power in the president. The reason is obvious, because Congress and the court include a majority of people, while the president is only one person, and one person is always easier to control than the majority. As long as a loyal servant with certain ruling experience is selected, promoted to the throne of the president in the quadrennial election, he will be a respectful servant of Wall Street. Thus, in order to concentrate all power in the president, all means of destroying the "sacred" constitution are adopted: what about the president's ability to "pocket veto" bills passed by Congress (that is, delaying signing, so that Congress bills cannot take effect)! What about the president's open co-opting of Congressmen's "spoils system of political parties"! What about giving the president actual legislative power, "blank bills" (especially during economic crises and wars, the content of blank bills passed by Congress is sparse, and the president supplements it with orders or administrative legislation, which is tantamount to giving the president actual legislative power)! All of this puts Congress under the control of the president.

It can be seen from this that in the era of imperialism, the parliament of capitalist countries has actually become a subordinate organ of the government. The legislative work of the parliament needs to be replaced or "assisted" by the president or the cabinet and can only be completed under their command. In this way, the government gradually gets rid of the supervision of the parliament. It not only controls the administrative power but also actually controls all the powers of the state. The extreme development of this situation is the most reactionary fascist terror dictatorship.

The bourgeois separation of powers, whether it is the parliament, the cabinet, or the court, is actually unable to make one power "check" and "balance" another power. However, in the function of suppressing the people, the pace of the three powers is completely consistent, and their reactionary nature is the same. The state has always been a tool of class oppression. No matter how different the forms of the bourgeois state are, "their essence is the same: all these states, in any case, are ultimately the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie." (Lenin: "State and Revolution")

Fundamentally opposed to the anti-democratic centralism of the bourgeois separation of powers, the draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China fully embodies the principle of democratic centralism of our country's political system.

Article 2 of the General Program of the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China stipulates:
"All power in the People's Republic of China belongs to the people. The organs through which the people exercise their power are the National People's Congress and the local people's congresses at all levels." This is to clearly fix in legal form that our country's basic political system is the people's congress system; it stipulates that all power in our country belongs to the people, and the people elect their own representatives by democratic election methods to form the National People's Congress and the people's congresses at all levels to exercise their power.

The draft Constitution stipulates that the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China is the highest organ of state power (Article 21) and is the sole organ for exercising state legislative power (Article 22). No organ can transcend or violate the will of the National People's Congress and exercise state power.

Our country's National People's Congress system is fundamentally different from the hypocritical representative system of the bourgeoisie. Our National People's Congress is a truly unified and concentrated highest state power organ. It truly concentrates the power of the people in its hands. It is a power organ that represents the will of the people and represents the full power of the people. It is a power organ that unifies legislative power and administrative power. All organs and all citizens of the country must be bound by the laws it formulates; all major national affairs must be decided by it. However, the powers of the bourgeois parliament are actually extremely limited. In the era of imperialism, the power of bourgeois countries is increasingly concentrated in the hands of the president or the cabinet. For example, the president of the United States and the cabinet of the United Kingdom not only exercise administrative power but also exercise legislative power, turning the so-called "representative organ" of the parliament into a chatting hall that is only used to fool the common people. In addition, our country's highest state power organ can exercise real supervision over the government, rather than exercising hypocritical supervision as in bourgeois countries.

The draft Constitution provides that the State Council of the People's Republic of China, namely the Government of the People's Republic of China, is the executive organ of the highest state power organ and the highest state administrative organ (Article 47). The State Council is responsible to the National People's Congress and reports its work to it; during the adjournment of the National People's Congress, it is responsible to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and reports its work to it (Article 52). Combining these two articles with Articles 21 and 22 regarding the National People's Congress, it can be seen that although the State Council is the highest state administrative organ, it is only the executive organ of the National People's Congress and must perform its tasks according to the decisions of the National People's Congress and is subject to the supervision of the National People's Congress and its standing organ, the Standing Committee. In this way, due to the unification of legislative power and administrative power, all the power of the state is concentrated in the hands of the people, and the people can directly manage the state. As for other state organs, such as the courts and procuratorial organs, from the provisions of Articles 80 and 84 of the draft Constitution, they are also uniformly responsible to the National People's Congress and its Standing Committee, report their work to them, and are subject to their supervision. The local people's courts at all levels are also responsible to and report their work to the people's congresses at the same level. These provisions are fundamentally different from the so-called "administrative independence" and "judicial independence" of the bourgeois separation of powers.

The draft Constitution stipulates that the people's congresses at all levels in the localities are local state power organs except that they have no legislative power (Article 55); it stipulates that the local people's committees at all levels are the executive organs of the local people's congresses at all levels and are local state administrative organs (Article 62); it stipulates that the local people's committees at all levels are responsible to the people's congresses at the same level and the state administrative organs at the higher level and report their work to them. The local people's committees at all levels throughout the country are all state administrative organs under the unified leadership of the State Council and are all subordinate to the State Council (Article 66). The dual subordination of the local people's committees at all levels to the people's congresses at the same level and the state administrative organs at the higher level fully implements the principle of democratic centralism in this organizational structure.

This is the state power of our country, this is the people's democratic system of the socialist type—the people's congress system—which truly belongs to the people, is consistent from top to bottom, and completely unifies legislative power and administrative power. It fully represents the will of the working class and the laboring people and fully embodies the principle of democratic centralism in its organizational form.

Article 2 of the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China stipulates: "The National People's Congress, the local people's congresses at all levels, and other state organs shall all implement democratic centralism." This is to clearly fix in legal form the organizational principle of our country's people's congresses and all state organs.

What is the democratic centralism embodied in our draft Constitution? The most important points are as follows:
	(1) The state power organs and their representatives in our country are elected by the people and are subject to the supervision of voters or electoral units. Voters or electoral units have the right to remove their representatives in accordance with the law. For example, Articles 38 and 61 of the draft Constitution respectively make provisions for the supervision and removal of representatives of the National People's Congress and representatives of local people's congresses at all levels by the original electoral units or voters in accordance with the law. This fully shows that the people of our country have mastered state power and have become the masters of the country.

In all bourgeois countries, the opposite is true. There, the principle of "independence" of representatives is stipulated, thus enabling representatives to escape the supervision of voters.
	(2) The administrative organs, courts, and procuratorial organs of our country are all produced by the state power organs, are responsible to the state power organs and report their work to them, and are subject to the supervision of the state power organs; the central and local administrative organs of our country at all levels are the executive organs of the National People's Congress and the local people's congresses at all levels; the state power organs have the right to dismiss the members of the state organs produced by them.

The bourgeois separation of powers system is fundamentally opposed to the above-mentioned system in our country. The separation of legislative power and administrative power there makes the parliament an ornamental appendage. It is not the people and the parliament that truly manipulate state power, but the monopoly capital groups. The parliament's supervision of the administrative power is fundamentally powerless, let alone the removal of members of state organs.
	(3) The principle of democratic centralism in our country's state management is manifested in the combination of, on the one hand, widely giving play to the initiative and creativity of each locality to adapt to local conditions and, on the other hand, implementing the central unified, centralized, and planned leadership. The principle of the lower level subordinating to the higher level and the locality subordinating to the center must be implemented in organization and work. This will ensure the political unity of all the people, improve work efficiency, and more effectively mobilize social forces to complete the great task of socialist construction and socialist transformation.

This principle of democratic centralism in our country's political system is fundamentally opposed to the bureaucratic centralism of the bourgeoisie. The main manifestations of the bureaucratic centralism of the bourgeoisie are: restricting and binding the enthusiasm of the masses of the people with the strict centralization of state management, and disregarding the initiative and creativity of the localities; parliamentary organs and state administrative organs are divorced from the working masses and are not subject to the supervision of the masses at all. Lenin once said that the bourgeois democracy and parliamentarism are organized in such a way that the working masses are extremely alienated from the administrative organs, and the officials of the central organs stand above the local "autonomous" organs. These officials actually deprive these local "autonomous" organs elected according to the bourgeois election law of any independence. This is the anti-democratic essence of the bourgeoisie in state organs and their organizational activities.

Finally, the spirit of democratic centralism in our country's political system is also fully reflected in Article 17 of the draft Constitution: "All state organs must rely on the masses of the people, maintain close ties with the masses, listen to the opinions of the masses, and accept the supervision of the masses." And Article 18: "All state organ workers must be loyal to the people's democratic system, abide by the Constitution and laws, and strive to serve the people." These provisions ensure that our country's state organs can unite all the people and give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses of the people in labor production, in participating in state management, and in socialist construction to victoriously realize the state's general task during the transition period.

    关于国家机构的民主集中制原则
    君韦
    民主集中制，是工人阶级政党的组织原则，又是工人阶级领导的国家机构的组织原则。苏维埃制和人民民主制这两种形式，都是按照民主集中的原则建立的，都是民主集中制的政体。
    作为国家机构的组织原则的民主集中制包含两个同等重要的方面。第一，民主制主要是指：（一）工人阶级和劳动人民参加国家管理，真正成为国家的主人；（二）最高国家权力机关和地方国家权力机关由人民选举产生；（三）全民制定宪法；（四）国家行政机关对国家权力机关负责并报告工作。第二，集中制主要是指：（一）最高国家权力机关是行使国家立法权的唯一机关；（二）严格遵守宪法和法律；（三）上级国家机关的决定对于下级国家机关的拘束力；（四）在国家机关内实行少数服从多数、下级服从上级、地方服从中央的制度。这种民主集中制，是在民主基础上的集中，在集中指导下的民主。国家机关根据民主集中制的原则，从下到上和从上到下组成一个完整的统一体。
    民主集中制与资产阶级的三权分立制是根本对立的，这两种不同的国家机构组织原则，代表了两个历史时代。无产阶级专政或人民民主专政，都是工人阶级领导的国家的国体（国家的实质），而民主集中制就是适应这种国体的国家机构的组织原则。
    民主集中制这种崭新的东西，最早的萌芽形式是一八七一年的巴黎公社。马克思从巴黎公社的经验中找到的问题是：无产阶级革命拿什么来代替资产阶级的国家机器，在资本主义过渡到社会主义时期中，新型的国家制度应该是什么。巴黎公社的经验证明工人阶级不能简单地夺取现成的国家机器，而必须打碎资产阶级旧的国家机器，建立无产阶级专政。当时马克思曾一度指示，说无产阶级专政的最适宜的国家政体不是国会制的共和国，而是巴黎公社式的政治组织，马克思称这种式样为“终究发现了的，可以使劳苦群众在经济上获得解放的政治形式”。但可惜马克思在自己的著作里没有把这一指示继续加以发挥，于是这一指示在以后许多年中便被人遗忘了。
    列宁根据俄国一九○五年和一九一七年二月两次大革命的经验，又吸取了巴黎公社的教训，认为无产阶级专政的国家政体不是国会制而是苏维埃制。早在一九一七年四月列宁就着重指出：“公社的实质不在于资产阶级所通常寻求的，而是在于它建立了特殊形式的国家。这种国家在俄国已经存在，即工人兵士代表苏维埃。”列宁的伟大继承者斯大林在“论列宁主义基础”中说：“苏维埃共和国就是那个久经寻找而终于找到了的政治形式，在这个形式底范围中也就应当实现无产阶级底经济解放，社会主义底完全胜利，巴黎公社是这种形式底萌芽。苏维埃政权是这种形式底发展和完成。”事实已经证明，苏维埃政体和以后的人民民主政体，都是按照马克思列宁主义的民主集中制的原则建立起来的。
    关于资产阶级的分权制，列宁曾经说过，它和以前的封建国家比起来，是历史上的一个进步。十八世纪初资产阶级分权制的思想，反映了当时资产阶级反对封建专制和夺取政权的进步要求。那时的国家是封建君主的国家，君主独揽了全国的行政、立法和司法的大权。资产阶级反对这种封建独裁者，主张从皇帝那里分一部分权力归自己掌握，例如首先是想分立法权，然后再争得司法权。分权制在当时是意味着：使立法权属于代表“社会”的机关，行政权则属于君主，于是分权原则就成了把绝对君主政体改变成有限的宪政君主政体的纲领。在十八世纪初期和中期，从洛克的分权原则到孟德斯鸠的“法意”，都是鼓吹这种三权分立的学说。分权原则曾经是一七八七年美国宪法和一七九一年法国宪法的主要原则之一。资产阶级取得国家权力之后，这些要求经过改装就作为资产阶级国家机构的组织原则，以适应和巩固它的国体——资产阶级专政。资产阶级掌握了国家权力之后，分权的原则就随着丧失了它原来的社会内容，这时它的意义是：（一）调和资产阶级内部的矛盾和冲突；（二）对被压迫的广大人民起一种欺骗的作用，蒙蔽其资产阶级专政的实质。
    这种号称“民主”的“三权分立制”实际上是怎样的呢？列宁在“国家与革命”一书中说得对：“请看任何一个国会制的国家，由美国至瑞士，由法国至英国，挪威等等，那里真正的‘国家’工作是在后台办理，是由阁部、官厅、参谋部执行的。在国会里，仅仅专为愚弄‘老百姓’而从事空谈。”
    试看资产阶级的“三权分立制”演变到帝国主义时代的情景吧。先以英国为例。在十八世纪的英国，已确定了内阁应向下院负责，并受下院的监督。但从十九世纪末到二十世纪初，这一情况起了基本的变化。内阁排斥了国会所起的作用，而在实际上占据了专政地位，它不但领导国家的内政与外交，而且也指导国会的立法工作，有时甚至超越国会而成为执行立法权的机关了。结果是：行政权加强，立法权削弱，内阁操纵了国会的立法。
    再以美国为例。现在的美国已完全抛弃了十八世纪独立战争时代的“民主”“自由”的旗帜，践踏了曾被宣布为“神圣的”三权分立的宪法条文，公开走上了法西斯化的道路。在美国宪法上所规定的总统、国会、法院三个机关中，华尔街的垄断资产阶级特别垂青于总统，把所有的国家的权力都逐步集中于总统。其理由是很明显的，因为国会和法院都包括多数人，总统则是一个人，一个人总比多数人更容易控制。只要选中一个有一定统治经验的忠实的奴仆，在四年一度的选举中提拔出来，推上总统的宝座，他便是华尔街的恭顺仆从。于是，为了集中一切权力于总统，所有破坏“神圣的”宪法的手段都采用了：什么总统对国会通过的法案能在“口袋里否决”（即迟不签字，使国会法案不能生效）啊！什么总统公开拉拢国会议员的“政党分赃制度”啊！什么使总统享有实际的立法权“空白法案”（特别在经济危机和战争的期间，国会通过的空白法案内容寥寥，而让总统以命令或行政立法补充之，这无异给总统实际的立法权）啊等等，这都使国会处于总统的控制之下。
    由此可见，在帝国主义时代，资本主义国家的国会实际上变成了政府的从属机构，国会的立法工作需要由总统或内阁来代替或“协助”，并要在它们的指挥下才能完成。这样，政府就逐渐脱离了国会的监督，它不仅掌握了行政权，而且实际掌握了国家的一切权力。这种情形发展到极端，就是最反动的法西斯的恐怖专政。
    资产阶级的分权制，不论国会也好，内阁也好，法院也好，实际上是不能够使一个权力去“牵制”“平衡”另一个权力的。但是在镇压人民的功能上，三权的步调却是完全一致的，它们的反动性质是相同的。国家，从来就是阶级压迫的工具。资产阶级国家，不管它的形式怎样的不同，“但它们的本质是同一的：所有这些国家，不管怎样，归根到底一定是资产阶级专政。”（列宁：“国家与革命”）
    和资产阶级反民主集中制的分权制根本相反，我们中华人民共和国宪法草案充分地体现了我国政体的民主集中制原则。
    中华人民共和国宪法草案总纲第二条规定：
  “中华人民共和国的一切权力属于人民。人民行使权力的机关是全国人民代表大会和地方各级人民代表大会。”这就是用法律的形式明确固定了我国基本政治制度是人民代表大会制度；规定了我国的一切权力属于人民，人民由民主选举方法，选出自己的代表组成全国人民代表大会和各级人民代表大会，来行使自己的权力。
    宪法草案规定了中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会是最高国家权力机关（第二十一条）。又是行使国家立法权的唯一机关（第二十二条）。没有任何机关可以超越或违反全国人民代表大会的意志而行使国家权力。
    我国的全国人民代表大会制度，和资产阶级的虚伪的代议制是根本不同的。我们的全国人民代表大会，乃是真正的、统一集中的最高国家权力机关，是确实把人民的权力集中在手内，它是代表人民意志和代表人民全权的权力机关，是立法权与行政权统一的权力机关。全国一切机关和全体公民，一律要受它所制定的法律的约束；一切国家大事，都要由它来决定。而资产阶级的国会的职权，实际上是极受限制的。到帝国主义时代，资产阶级国家的权力，日益集中在总统或内阁的手里，例如美国的总统和英国的内阁，不仅行使行政权，而且还行使着立法权，把所谓“代表机关”的国会变成了仅仅专为愚弄老百姓的清谈馆。此外，我国最高国家权力机关，对政府能够行使真正的监督，而不是像在资产阶级国家那样行使虚伪的监督。
    宪法草案规定了中华人民共和国国务院，即中华人民共和国政府，是最高国家权力机关的执行机关，是最高国家行政机关（第四十七条）。国务院对全国人民代表大会负责并报告工作；在全国人民代表大会闭会期间，对全国人民代表大会常务委员会负责并报告工作（第五十二条）。把这两条和第二十一条、第二十二条关于全国人民代表大会的规定联系起来，就可以看出：国务院虽然是最高国家行政机关，但它只是全国人民代表大会的执行机关，必须根据全国人民代表大会的决定执行任务，而且受全国人民代表大会及其常设机关常务委员会的监督。这样，由于立法权与行政权的统一，国家的一切权力就都集中在人民手里，人民就能够直接管理国家了。至于其他国家机关，如法院和检察机关，从宪法草案的第八十条和第八十四条的规定来看，也都是统一地向全国人民代表大会及其常务委员会负责和报告工作，并受它们的监督。地方各级人民法院也对本级人民代表大会负责并报告工作。这些规定和资产阶级分权制的所谓“行政权独立”和“司法独立”是根本不同的。
    宪法草案规定了地方各级人民代表大会除了没有立法权外，都是地方国家权力机关（第五十五条）；规定了地方各级人民委员会是地方各级人民代表大会的执行机关，都是地方国家行政机关（第六十二条）；规定了地方各级人民委员会都对本级人民代表大会和上级国家行政机关负责并报告工作。全国地方各级人民委员会都是国务院统一领导下的国家行政机关，都服从国务院（第六十六条）。地方各级人民委员会对本级人民代表大会和上级国家行政机关的两重从属制，充分贯彻了这种组织机构的民主集中制的原则。
    这就是我国的国家权力，这就是真正属于人民的、上下一致的、立法权与行政权完全统一的、属于社会主义类型的人民民主制度——人民代表大会制度。它充分代表了工人阶级和劳动人民的意志，在组织构成形式上充分体现了民主集中制的原则。
    中华人民共和国宪法草案第二条规定：“全国人民代表大会、地方各级人民代表大会和其他国家机关，一律实行民主集中制。”这就是用法律的形式明确固定了我国人民代表大会和一切国家机关的组织原则。
    体现在我国宪法草案中的民主集中制是什么呢？最主要的有以下各点：
      （一）我国的国家权力机关及其代表，是由人民选举产生的，并受选民或选举单位的监督，选民或选举单位依照法律有权撤换自己的代表。如宪法草案第三十八条和第六十一条，分别作了对全国人民代表大会代表和地方各级人民代表大会代表由原选举单位或选民实行监督和依照法律撤换代表的规定。这就充分说明了我国人民掌握了国家权力，成了国家的主人。
    在各资产阶级国家里根本相反，那里规定了代表“独立”的原则，因而使代表能逃避选民的监督。
      （二）我国国家的行政机关、法院和检察机关都是由国家权力机关产生的，向国家权力机关负责和报告工作，并受国家权力机关的监督；我国中央和地方的各级行政机关乃是全国人民代表大会和地方各级人民代表大会的执行机关；国家权力机关对于由它所产生的国家机关的组成人员有权罢免。
    资产阶级国家的三权分立制与我国的上述制度根本相反，那里立法权与行政权的分立使国会成了装饰门面的附属品，真正操纵国家权力的不是人民和国会，而是垄断资本集团。国会对于行政权的监督，根本是无能为力的，更谈不到什么对于国家机关组成人员的罢免了。
      （三）我国的国家管理的民主集中制的原则，表现在一方面广泛发挥各个地方的因地制宜的工作主动性和创造性，一方面实行中央统一的集中的有计划的领导，这两方面是互相结合的。在组织与工作中必须贯彻下级服从上级、地方服从中央的原则。这样就能保证全体人民在政治上的统一，提高工作效能，以便更有效地动员社会力量，完成社会主义建设和社会主义改造的伟大任务。
    我国政体的这种民主集中制原则是与资产阶级的官僚主义集中制根本对立的。资产阶级的官僚主义集中制的主要表现是：以国家管理的严格集中去限制与束缚人民群众的积极性，轻视地方的主动性和创造性；议会机关、国家行政机关都与劳动群众脱离，根本不受群众的监督。列宁曾经说过，资产阶级的民主制和国会制是这样组织的：劳动群众与行政机构极端疏远，中央机关的官吏们站在地方
  “自治”机关之上，这些官吏们实际剥夺了依照资产阶级选举法所选出来的这种地方“自治”机关的任何独立性。这就是资产阶级在国家机关及其组织活动方面的反民主的本质。
    最后，我国政体上的民主集中制的精神，还充分表现在宪法草案的第十七条：“一切国家机关必须依靠人民群众，经常保持同群众的密切联系，倾听群众的意见，接受群众的监督。”和第十八条：“一切国家机关工作人员必须效忠人民民主制度，服从宪法和法律，努力为人民服务。”这些规定，保证了我国的国家机关能够团结全体人民，高度发挥人民群众在劳动生产中、在参加国家管理工作和社会主义建设事业中的积极性和创造性，来胜利地实现国家在过渡时期的总任务。
