    Beijing held a commemorative meeting on the tenth anniversary of Comrade Zou Taofen's death on the afternoon of the 23rd in Beijing. Attending the meeting were people from the capital's press and publishing circles, friends of Comrade Zou Taofen during his lifetime, including Shen Junru, Shen Yanbing, Hu Yuzhi, Hu Sheng, Zhang Youyu, Li Geng, and youth representatives Liu Daosheng, Zhang Dazhong, and others, totaling more than 500 people.
    The commemorative meeting was presided over by Hu Yuzhi. He began by saying that our great motherland is advancing towards a prosperous and happy socialist society, and we cannot and should not forget the thousands upon thousands of people with lofty ideals who have worked hard for the people's revolutionary cause for many years, and Zou Taofen was one of them. Zou Taofen was the founder and editor-in-chief of "Life Weekly," "Life Daily," and other progressive publications. He was an outstanding journalist and publisher. He was a skilled propagandist and agitator in the anti-Japanese national salvation movement. He was a good teacher and helpful friend to the Chinese youth who were under the oppression of reactionary rule at that time. The road he took was the road of revolutionary intellectuals. Hu Yuzhi finally called on the attendees to learn from Zou Taofen's noble political character, his boundless loyalty to the cause of the people, his selfless work ethic, and his conscientious and responsible attitude towards the people's publishing cause.
    Shen Yanbing, in his speech, described the arduous struggle of Zou Taofen in his press and publishing work. He said: Zou Taofen was an intellectual who developed from democratic ideas to believing in communism. We must earnestly learn from his spirit of doing his best in what should be done and his spirit of hard work. As our motherland is now engaged in the great socialist construction, we need more excellent cultural workers like Zou Taofen.
    Liu Daosheng pointed out in his speech: Zou Taofen had a wide influence among the Chinese youth of his time. The broad masses of young people accepted new ideas from the publications he ran, arousing patriotic enthusiasm and the will to fight against imperialism and feudalism. Zou Taofen's patriotic ideas and anti-Japanese national salvation activities played an important role in promoting the generation of youth at that time to embark on the road of revolution, which cannot but make Chinese youth admire and deeply remember him.
    Finally, Hu Sheng introduced Zou Taofen's history of struggle in participating in the revolutionary cause, pointing out that Zou Taofen's initial thinking belonged to the scope of bourgeois nationalism, but later, under the leadership of the proletariat, he abandoned his old ideas and combined with the broad masses of people, dedicating himself to the cause of the people. Hu Sheng concluded by saying that in commemorating Zou Taofen, we hope to organize and publish his collected works in the future.
    Also reported: Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin. Tianjin's press, publishing circles, and local organizations of various people's organizations jointly held a gathering on the afternoon of the 23rd to commemorate the tenth anniversary of Zou Taofen's death. At the meeting, Shao Hongye, deputy director and editor-in-chief of Tianjin Daily, gave a detailed introduction to Zou Taofen's life.

    纪念大会由胡愈之主持。他首先讲话说，我们的伟大祖国正在向着繁荣幸福的社会主义社会前进，我们不能也不应忘记许多年来为人民革命事业艰苦奋斗的千千万万的志士仁人，邹韬奋就是其中的一人。邹韬奋是“生活周刊”、“生活日报”以及其他进步刊物的创办人和主编者。他是杰出的新闻工作者和出版工作者。他是抗日救亡运动中宣传鼓动的能手。他是当时在反动统治压迫下的中国青年的良师益友。他所走的道路，就是革命知识分子的道路。胡愈之最后号召到会的人向邹韬奋学习他崇高的政治品质，学习他对人民事业的无比忠诚，学习他忘我的劳动精神和为人民出版事业的认真负责的工作态度。
    沈雁冰在讲话中叙述了邹韬奋从事新闻出版工作的艰苦奋斗情况。他说：邹韬奋是由民主主义思想发展到信仰共产主义的知识分子，我们要认真地学习他那种应该作的事就全力去作和艰苦奋斗的精神。当我们祖国现在正进行伟大社会主义建设的时期，我们更加需要有像邹韬奋那样优秀的文化工作者。
    刘导生在讲话中指出：邹韬奋在和他同时代的中国青年中间，有很广泛的影响。广大青年从他主办的出版物中接受了新的思想，激起了爱国主义的热情和反帝反封建的斗志。邹韬奋的爱国思想和抗日救亡活动，在推动当时一代青年走上革命的道路中起了重要的作用，这便不能不使中国青年十分感佩和深深怀念。
    最后由胡绳在会上介绍了邹韬奋参加革命事业的斗争历史，他指出：邹韬奋开始时的思想是属于资产阶级民族主义范围的，但以后他在无产阶级领导下抛开了旧思想和广大人民结合起来，献身人民的事业。胡绳最后说，我们为纪念邹韬奋，希望今后能整理出版他的文集。
