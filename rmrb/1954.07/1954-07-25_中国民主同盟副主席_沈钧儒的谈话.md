The agreement reached at the Geneva Conference on the Indochina issue is a victory for the peaceful diplomatic policies of the Soviet Union, China, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and a victory for the peace-loving people of the world. This victory once again proves that as long as the progressive forces of the world undertake the cause of safeguarding peace, the conspiracies of warmongers can be defeated, and the forces of peace are invincible.

In Premier Zhou's final speech at the Geneva Conference, he pointed out that Asian countries should consult and cooperate with each other on the basis of the principles of mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence. These five principles are not only applicable to the relations between China and India, and China and Burma, but have also received enthusiastic support and endorsement from peace-loving people all over the world. As long as all countries in the world act in accordance with these principles, countries with different social systems and political systems in Asia and the world can coexist peacefully, and any international disputes can be resolved through consultation. The negotiated settlement of the issue of restoring peace in Indochina once again eloquently proves this truth.

The Geneva Conference marks the beginning of the People's Republic of China's first consultation with major powers on major international issues as one of the world's major powers. At this conference, our country, together with the Soviet Union and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, made great contributions to world peace. Our efforts have won praise from world public opinion, and our country's international prestige has been greatly enhanced. These are all the results of Chairman Mao's wise and correct leadership and the outstanding diplomatic efforts of Premier Zhou and our delegation, which make us feel infinitely excited and honored.

    中国民主同盟副主席
    沈钧儒的谈话
    这次日内瓦会议就印度支那问题达成协议是苏联、中国、越南民主共和国和平外交政策的胜利，也是世界爱好和平人民的胜利。这一胜利又一次证明了：只要全世界的进步力量把维护和平的事业担当起来，战争挑拨者的阴谋是一定可以击败的，和平的力量是不可战胜的。
    周总理在日内瓦会议的最后一次发言中指出：亚洲国家彼此之间应该根据互相尊重领土主权、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利、和平共处的原则进行协商和合作。这五项原则不仅适用于中印、中缅之间的关系，它已得到了全世界爱好和平人士的热烈支持与拥护，只要世界各国按照这些原则办事，亚洲和世界不同的社会制度和政治制度的国家就能够和平共处，任何国际争端都可以协商解决，印度支那恢复和平问题的协商解决再一次雄辩地证明了这一真理。
    日内瓦会议是中华人民共和国第一次以世界大国之一的身份与各大国一起协商重大国际问题的开端，在这次会议中，我国与苏联和越南民主共和国一道对世界和平作出了巨大的贡献。我们的努力已取得了世界广泛舆论的赞扬，我国的国际威望已大大提高，这都是毛主席英明正确的领导，周总理和我国代表团卓越的外交努力的成果，使我们感到无限的兴奋与光荣。
