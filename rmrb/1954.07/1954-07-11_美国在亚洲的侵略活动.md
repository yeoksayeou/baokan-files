    U.S. to Further Expand Thai Army
    "Chicago Sun-Times" reporter Frederick Kuh reports that Thai Ambassador to the United States, Sarasin, after visiting President Eisenhower on the 6th, spoke to Kuh about doubling the size of the Thai armed forces. Currently, the Thai armed forces consist of 72,000 personnel, including 55,000 in the army, 12,000 in the navy, and 5,000 in the air force. Additionally, there are 40,000 paramilitary police used for border patrols. Sarasin suggested that the United States draft a military "aid" plan with a three-year term, spending $400 million. In the past four years, U.S. military programs have amounted to approximately $160 million. Sarasin said, "Currently, Thai military expenditure accounts for 45 percent of its budget."
    Bangkok's "Daily Mail," citing well-informed sources, said that as a result of negotiations between Thailand and the United States, the Thai army will be increased to six divisions with a total of 90,000 personnel. The United States will provide funds for the establishment of these six divisions and will "help arm" them.
    U.S. Forces in Japan to be Redeployed
    To coordinate with the new U.S. military conspiracy in the Far East, General Hull, commander of U.S. Forces in the Far East, officially announced on the 9th that the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division stationed in Hokkaido, Japan, will be transferred to Kyushu, Japan, this fall. Hull said that this relocation will greatly increase the "mobility" of U.S. forces and enable U.S. forces to be "strategically deployed freely in the Far East when the situation requires."
    When United Press reporter Potts learned of this new deployment plan for U.S. forces in Japan from Hull on the 6th, he revealed that the U.S. military also hopes that this relocation will "stimulate Japan to take more effective actions to transform the former security forces into a combat-ready army."
    U.S. Intensifies Military Activities in Iran
    A "Scotsman" correspondent in London reports that military activities are being intensified in the Kingdom of Iran. "U.S. Air Force Major Thompson arrived in Tehran from Ankara on June 20 to hold talks with Iranian Defense Minister General Hedayat and Iranian Chief of Staff General Batmangelich. They discussed the supply of aircraft to the Iranian Air Force and the construction of bases.
    It is understood that the U.S. Department of Defense wants to build or expand airports in ten locations in Iran. These locations include Isfahan, Kerman, Shiraz, Ahvaz, and Bandar Abbas. Just as in Turkey, U.S. 'defense' appropriations will be used to modernize and expand Iranian ports. These ports include some on the Caspian Sea, and the Caspian Sea coast, like the Black Sea, also includes Soviet territory."

    美国在亚洲的侵略活动
    美国将进一步扩充泰国军队
    美国“芝加哥太阳时报”记者弗雷德里克·库乌报道，泰国驻美大使沙拉信在六日访问了艾森豪威尔总统之后，对库乌谈到关于把泰国武装部队扩充一倍的问题。现在泰国武装部队共有七万二千人，其中陆军五万五千人、海军一万二千人、空军五千人。另外被用来进行巡逻边境工作的半军事的警察部队有四万人。沙拉信建议美国拟订一个军事“援助”计划，以三年为期支出四亿美元。而在过去四年中，美国军事计划的款项约为一亿六千万美元。沙拉信说：“现今泰国军费占它的预算的百分之四十五。”
    泰国曼谷的“每日邮报”引用消息灵通人士的话说，泰国和美国之间进行谈判的结果，泰国陆军将增加为数九万人的六个师。美国对这六个师的成立将供给资金，并且“帮助武装”他们。
    驻在日本的美军将作新部署
    为配合美国在远东的新军事阴谋，远东美军司令赫尔在九日正式宣布：驻在日本北海道的美军第一骑兵师将在今年秋天调到日本的九州。赫尔说：这一调动将大大地增加美军的“机动性”，并使美军“在情况需要时可以在远东的战略上运用自如”。
    合众社记者波茨在六日从赫尔那里获悉驻日美军的这一新部署计划时曾透露，美国军方还希望以这一调动来“刺激日本采取更有效的行动把从前的保安部队变成一支有战斗准备的陆军”。
    美国加紧在伊朗的军事活动
    “苏格兰人报”驻伦敦记者报道，在伊朗王国的军事活动正在加强。“美国空军少校汤普逊在六月二十日从安卡拉飞抵德黑兰，以便和伊朗国防大臣海达雅特将军和伊朗参谋总长巴特曼·开利奇将军举行会谈。他们讨论的是以飞机供应伊朗空军和建筑基地的问题。
    据悉，美国国防部想在伊朗十个地方建筑或扩大机场。这些地方包括伊斯法罕、基尔曼、设刺子、阿瓦士和本得亚伯斯。正像在土耳其一样，美国的‘防御’拨款将被用来使伊朗港口现代化并加以扩大。这些港口包括里海的某些港口，而里海海岸，像黑海一样，也包括有苏联的领土。”
