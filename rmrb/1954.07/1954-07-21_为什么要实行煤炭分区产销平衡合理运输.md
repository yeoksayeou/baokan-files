Why Implement Regional Coal Production and Sales Balance and Rational Transportation

State Planning Commission Transportation Planning Bureau

The State Council of the Central People's Government has decided to implement a regional coal production and sales balance and rational transportation system starting in August of this year. This is a measure of great significance to the national economy.

According to the State Planning Commission and the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council's inspection of coal transportation in 1953, very serious irrational phenomena such as excessive long-distance, counter-current, and repetitive transportation existed in coal transportation work. For example, the coal supplied to Shanghai in 1953 came from fourteen coal mines, including the Tianshifu and Pinggang coal mines in Northeast China, which were about 2,000 kilometers away; the Datong coal mine in Shanxi, which was more than 1,800 kilometers away; the Xiangyong, Zhenxing, and Anling coal mines in southern Hunan Province; and the Kailuan in Hebei, Jiaozuo in Henan, Yangquan in Shanxi, Zibo and Xinwen in Shandong, Jiawang in Jiangsu, and Huainan in Anhui. The coal supplied to Beijing came from nine coal mines. In 1953, 350,000 tons of bituminous coal were transported from the Kailuan coal mine near Tianjin, east of Beijing, while the Tianjin area transported 360,000 tons of bituminous coal from the Datong coal mine, west of Beijing. Part of the anthracite coal used in Beijing was transported from Jiaozuo in Henan and Yangquan in Shanxi, while the Mentougou anthracite coal in the suburbs of Beijing was transported south to Baoding and other places in Hebei. The coal used in Jiamusi City in Northeast China was supplied by the Jixi mine south of Jiamusi, while the Hegang coal north of Jiamusi flowed south to Mishan and Mudanjiang near the Jixi mine. This kind of excessive long-distance and counter-current transportation existed universally on various railway sections, especially on the railway lines between the two mining areas. In addition, the phenomenon of repetitive transportation, in which various units concentrated coal in one place and then transported it outwards, was extremely common. For example, the Xidaokou station in the suburbs of Beijing, which did not produce coal at all, transported more than 119,000 tons of coal in 1953, and the Lanfeng station in Henan transported more than 47,000 tons of coal. According to preliminary statistics, in 1953, the unreasonable transportation of coal over long distances, counter-currents, and repetitions wasted a total of 1.8 billion ton-kilometers of transportation capacity, which was equivalent to transporting 135,000 fewer railcars of other materials.

The main reason for the above-mentioned unreasonable transportation is the uneven distribution of productive forces in various regions. This is caused by three reasons. Objectively speaking, the distribution of coal resources in our country is uneven, with more in the north and less in the south, more in the east and less in the west, which inevitably leads to the flow of coal from the north to the south and from the east to the west. Secondly, there are man-made irrationalities caused by history. For example, Shijiazhuang has neither a steel plant nor a coal mine, but it has a coking plant. The coal used for coking has to be transported from the Jingxing, Xishan, and Fengfeng coal mines to the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant in Beijing for washing, and then transported back to Shijiazhuang for coking. However, the coke produced has to be transported to the Longyan Iron Mine near Xuanhua and the Yangquan Iron Smelting Plant for use, which causes three reciprocating counter-current transports of raw coal, washed coal, and coke between Beijing and Shijiazhuang. Finally, some factories did not pay attention to the principle of "obtaining materials locally and supplying them nearby" during construction. The boilers of some power plants were designed to use good coal, so that the low-quality coal from nearby coal mines could not be fully utilized, which wasted national resources and caused irrationality in transportation.

The lack of planning and organization in production and supply work, and the disconnection or lack of close integration between supply, production, sales, and transportation, are also reasons for various unreasonable transportation phenomena. Before 1953, the national coal was not distributed according to economic zones. Various coal-using units only made requests from the perspective of their own unit's convenience and local economic accounting, and the supply department followed behind the coal-using units, supplying whatever they needed, which resulted in coal flowing everywhere. For example, according to the rational flow direction, the coal used in Zhangjiakou and Xuanhua should be supplied by the Datong coal mine in the west, but because Zhangjiakou and Xuanhua are closer to Xiahuayuan, and the citizens are accustomed to using Xiahuayuan coal, and the price of Xiahuayuan coal is also cheaper than that of Datong coal, a lot of coal from Xiahuayuan in the east is transported to Zhangjiakou and Xuanhua, causing counter-current transportation with Datong coal between Zhangjiakou and Xiahuayuan.

In order to change the above-mentioned unreasonable situation, the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council promulgated the Interim Measures for Regional Coal Production and Sales Balance and Rational Transportation. It was decided to start a trial run in August and September of the third quarter of this year, and to officially implement it in October. In this interim measure, the country is temporarily divided into thirteen coal production and sales areas, including Hegang, Jixi, Xi'an, Fushun, Kailuan, Datong, Xishan, Huainan, Jiaozuo, Pingxiang, Zixing, Northwest, and Southwest, including forty-five state-owned and jointly state-private coal mines. The allocation, supply, sales, and transportation of coal produced by these coal mines shall be handled in accordance with the basic flow directions and production and sales areas stipulated in the interim measures. Other coal mines whose products are not uniformly distributed by the state are not restricted by the basic flow direction, but it is also stipulated that they should first be sold locally, and then in nearby areas, limited to not exceeding the scope of their respective production and sales areas. Separate flow directions are stipulated for coking coal, low-quality coal, coal for other special purposes, coal for railway locomotives that are still difficult to improve equipment and change habits for the time being, and coal for civilian use. As for the coal used for chemical analysis by scientific research units and geological departments, as long as there is proof from the higher-level leading organs, it can be exempted from the restrictions of the specified flow direction.

In order to reasonably use various means of transportation, develop water transportation, reduce the transportation burden on railways running parallel to rivers and seas, and strengthen the cooperation and collaboration between railway and water transportation departments, the interim measures also stipulate that the coal transported from Kailuan to Shanghai, Qingdao, Yantai, and other places should be shipped through the Qinhuangdao Wharf; the coal transported from Datong to Shanghai, Ningbo, and other places should be shipped through the Tanggu New Port Wharf; and the coal transported from Huainan to Shanghai, Wuhu, Anqing, Jiujiang, Huangshi, Daye, and northern Jiangsu should be shipped through the Yuxikou Wharf.

To fundamentally eliminate unreasonable transportation phenomena, it is also necessary to start with promoting the rational distribution of productive forces by region. Therefore, the decision of the Government Administration Council stipulates that when various departments compile basic construction plans, the design of newly built or renovated factories and mines and additional equipment (such as power generation, coal preparation, and coal washing equipment), the coal required or produced must consider the principle of obtaining materials locally, supplying them nearby, rationally using resources, and saving transportation capacity, so as to fundamentally solve the rational distribution of productive forces and eliminate unreasonable transportation phenomena.

Gradually changing coal-using habits, improving firing technology, and improving coal allocation methods are conditions for the smooth implementation of the regional coal production and sales balance and rational transportation system. Therefore, the decision also stipulates that various coal-using units and coal construction companies should organize trial burns of substitute coal, secondary coal, and low-quality coal from nearby coal mines according to their own needs, gradually change coal-using habits, improve firing technology, try mixed coal types, and appropriately improve coal-burning equipment when necessary and possible. At the same time, in order to reduce repetitive transportation, it is necessary to gradually change the current method of concentrating coal in one place and then transporting it outwards; coal should be transported directly from the coal mine to the unloading station at the place of use.

Correctly using the law of value and formulating appropriate railway freight rates is one of the effective means to restrict unreasonable transportation. At present, the Ministry of Railways is studying a new coal freight rate plan in accordance with the principles of rational transportation and rational flow direction according to the decision of the Government Administration Council. This freight rate plan will stipulate that transportation exceeding a certain distance will implement a system of increasing rates with increasing distance, and transportation that violates the rational flow direction and certain railway sections parallel to waterways will increase freight rates by a certain proportion, while direct transportation that is relatively long-distance but specified by the state will be given preferential price reductions. The implementation of this freight rate plan will greatly help restrict unreasonable transportation phenomena of excessive long-distance and counter-currents and encourage the use of water transportation.

After the implementation of the coal regional production and sales balance and rational transportation method, the production and sales relationship between various coal mines and coal-using units can be gradually fixed, and the transportation over too long distances can be greatly reduced. For example, the number of coal mines supplying coal to Shanghai can be reduced from fourteen to seven, and Beijing can be reduced from nine to five, and gradually reduced to single supply in the future, while counter-current and repetitive transportation can be completely eliminated. In this way, the railway transportation distance can be greatly shortened. Since coal is the industrial product with the largest output, and its transportation volume accounts for more than one-third of the total railway transportation volume, taking this measure can save a lot of transportation capacity and transportation costs, and alleviate the contradiction that the transportation capacity of some railway sections cannot meet the needs. In addition, it can also enable production units to correctly understand the needs of coal-using units, and better prepare coal production and basic construction plans based on this. The production capacity of local coal mines can also be fully utilized, thereby promoting the rational distribution of productive forces. At the same time, the needs of coal-using units can also be fully guaranteed, the transportation department can more easily grasp the source of goods and cargo flow, and the planning of coal production, allocation, supply, transportation, and sales can be strengthened, and national resources will be used rationally and economically.

    为什么要实行煤炭分区产销平衡合理运输
    国家计划委员会交通运输计划局
    中央人民政府政务院决定从今年八月份起实行煤炭分区产销平衡合理运输制度。这是一件对国民经济有重大意义的措施。
    根据国家计划委员会和政务院财政经济委员会对一九五三年煤炭运输情况的检查，发现煤炭运输工作上存在着十分严重的过远距离、对流和重复运输等不合理现象。如一九五三年供应上海市的煤炭来自十四个煤矿，其中有远达二千公里左右的东北田师府和平岗煤矿，有远达一千八百公里以上的山西大同煤矿，有来自湖南省南部的湘永、振兴、安陵煤矿，还有来自河北的开滦，河南的焦作，山西的阳泉，山东的淄博、新汶，江苏的贾汪，安徽的淮南等煤矿。供应北京市的煤炭来自九个煤矿，一九五三年由北京东面天津附近的开滦煤矿运来的烟煤有三十五万吨，而天津地区又从北京西面的大同煤矿运来烟煤三十六万吨，北京用的无烟煤有一部分是从河南的焦作和山西的阳泉运来，而北京市郊的门头沟无烟煤却又南运到河北的保定等地去。东北的佳木斯市用煤是由佳木斯以南的鸡西矿供应，而佳木斯以北的鹤岗煤又南流到鸡西矿附近的密山和牡丹江一带。这种过远距离的、对流的运输，在各个铁路区段上，特别是两个矿区之间的铁路线上普遍存在着。此外，各单位将煤炭集中一地然后又向外运的重复运输现象也极为普遍。如完全不产煤的北京市郊的西道口车站，一九五三年运出十一万九千多吨煤，河南的兰封车站运出四万七千多吨煤。据初步统计，一九五三年由于煤炭的过远距离、对流、重复等不合理运输，共浪费了十八亿吨公里的运输力，等于少运了十三万五千辆车箱的其他物资。
    造成上述不合理运输的主要原因，是各个地区的生产力分布不平衡。而这又是由三方面的原因造成的。从客观条件来说，是我国煤炭资源分布不平衡，北多南少，东多西少，势必要北煤南流，东煤西流。其次是历史上造成的人为的不合理。如石家庄既没有钢铁厂，又没有煤矿，却设有一座炼焦厂。炼焦用煤要从井陉、西山、峰峰等煤矿运到北京的石景山钢铁厂洗选后再运回石家庄炼焦。但炼成的焦却又要运往宣化附近的龙烟铁矿和阳泉炼铁厂使用，这就造成了原煤、洗煤、焦炭三者在北京石家庄间往复三次的对流运输。最后，某些工厂在建设时不注意“就地取材，就近供应”的原则，有些发电厂的锅炉是按使用好煤设计的，以致附近煤矿的劣质煤不能充分利用，既浪费了国家的资源，又造成了运输上的不合理。
    生产与供销工作的计划性和组织性不强，供、产、销、运间脱节或结合不密切也是造成各种运输不合理现象的原因。一九五三年以前，全国的煤炭不是按经济区分配的。各用煤单位只从本单位使用方便和局部的经济核算观点出发来提出要求，供应部门则跟在用煤单位后面跑，要什么就供应什么，结果就使得煤炭到处乱流。例如，根据合理流向，张家口和宣化用煤应由西面的大同煤矿供应，但由于张家口和宣化离下花园较近，市民习惯用下花园煤，同时下花园煤的价格也较大同煤便宜，结果东面的下花园有很多煤又运到张家口和宣化，造成了和大同煤在张家口、下花园间的对流运输。
    为了改变上述不合理的状况，政务院财政经济委员会颁布了煤炭分区产销平衡合理运输暂行办法。决定从今年三季度八、九两月开始试行，十月份正式实行。在这个暂行办法中，把全国暂时划分为鹤岗、鸡西、西安、抚顺、开滦、大同、西山、淮南、焦作、萍乡、资兴、西北、西南等十三个煤炭产销区，包括四十五个国营和公私合营的煤矿。这些煤矿所产煤炭的分配、供应、销售、运输，均按暂行办法中规定的基本流向与产销地区办理。其他不由国家统一分配产品的煤矿，其推销范围不受基本流向的限制，但也规定应首先在当地推销，其次在附近地区推销，以不超过各该产销区域范围为限。对于炼焦用煤、劣质煤和其他特殊用途的煤炭，以及某些暂时还难于改进设备与改变习惯的铁路机车用的煤炭和民用煤炭，均单独规定了流向。至于科学研究单位与地质部门化验分析用的煤炭，只要有上一级领导机关的证明，即可不受规定流向的限制。
    为了合理地使用各种运输工具，发展水运，减轻与河海并行的铁路的运输负担，加强铁路与水运部门之间的配合协作，暂行办法中还规定了由开滦运往上海及青岛、烟台等地的煤炭，应经由秦皇岛码头船运；由大同运往上海、宁波等地的煤炭，应经由塘沽新港码头船运；由淮南运往上海、芜湖、安庆、九江、黄石、大冶和苏北等地的煤炭应经由裕溪口码头船运。
    要根本消灭不合理运输现象，还必须从促进生产力按地区合理分布着手。因此，在政务院的决定中规定在各部门编制基本建设计划时，对于新建或改建的厂矿及增设备（如发电、选煤、洗煤设备等）的设计，其所需或所产生的煤炭必须考虑就地取材，就近供应合理使用资源和节约运输力的原则，以便从根本上解决生产力的合理分布问题，消灭不合理运输现象。
    逐步改变用煤习惯，提高烧火技术及改进煤炭调拨方法，是顺利推行煤炭分区产销平衡合理运输制度的条件。因此在决定中又规定各用煤单位及煤建公司应根据自己需要情况，组织就近煤矿的代用煤，次煤及劣质煤的试烧工作，逐步改变用煤习惯，提高烧火技术，试用混合煤种，在必要与可能的条件下，适当地改善烧煤设备。同时，为了减少重复运输，必须逐步改变在目前煤炭上集中一地然后又外运的办法；应将煤直接从煤矿运到使用地的卸车站。
    正确地利用价值法则，制订出适当的铁路运价，是限制不合理运输的有效手段之一，目前铁道部正根据政务院的决定按照合理运输的原则与合理流向研究煤炭新的运价方案。这一运价方案将规定超过一定距离的运输要实行递远递增制度，违反合理流向及某些与水路平行的铁路区段要增加一定比例的运费，而对于国家规定的，距离虽比较远的直达运输则减价优待，这一运价方案实行后，将大大有助于限制过远距离的，对流的不合理运输现象及鼓励利用水运。
    煤炭分区产销平衡合理运输办法实行后，可使各煤矿与各用煤单位之间的产销关系逐步地固定下来，过远距离的运输可以大大减少，如供应上海市用煤的煤矿可由十四个减少到七个，北京市可由九个减少到五个，以后还可逐步减少，走向单一供应，而对流和重复运输则可完全消灭。这样，铁路运输距离将可大大缩短，由于煤是产量最大的一种工业品，它的运输量要占铁路全部运输量的三分之一以上，因此采取这种措施以后，就能节省大量的运输力与运输费用，减轻目前某些铁路通段运输能力满足不了需要的矛盾。除此以外，还能使生产单位正确地了解用煤单位的需要，更好地据以编制煤炭的生产和基本建设计划，地方煤矿的生产能力也能以得到充分发挥，从而促进生产力的合理分布。同时用煤单位的需要也能够得到充分保证，运输部门对于货源货流的掌握也比较容易，煤炭的生产、分配、供应、运输、销售各方面的工作计划性都可以加强，国家资源将得到合理与节约的使用。
