Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 10th: According to TASS, the ceremony of awarding the "Strengthening International Peace" Stalin International Prize to Isabelle Blum, an outstanding Belgian social activist and parliamentarian, was held on July 9th in the Sverdlov Hall of the Moscow Kremlin.

    Participating in this grand ceremony were leaders from Soviet cultural and artistic circles, representatives from the working people of Moscow, and various social organizations.

    The writer Ilya Ehrenburg presented Mrs. Blum with the certificate and gold medal of the Stalin International Peace Prize Laureate. In his speech at the award ceremony, he pointed out Mrs. Blum's great struggle over the years for peace and for strengthening the friendship between the peoples of all countries. He wholeheartedly congratulated Mrs. Blum on receiving this lofty award and expressed hope that she would achieve new successes in her noble activities to strive for the welfare of the people of all countries and for the happiness of mankind.

    Moldvinov, President of the Soviet Academy of Architecture and member of the Soviet Peace Committee, Gagarina, representative of the Soviet Women's Anti-Fascist Committee, Kotova, a representative of male and female workers from the Moscow Kalinin Woolen Mill and a well-known industrial innovator, and Chalyev, a representative of Soviet cultural workers and a People's Artist of the Soviet Union, all spoke at the meeting, expressing warm congratulations to Mrs. Blum. They pointed out that the Soviet people learned with deep satisfaction the news that Mrs. Blum had received the Stalin International Peace Prize, and through Mrs. Blum, expressed their respect to the Belgian people who are fighting for world peace.

    In her reply, Mrs. Blum said: The "Strengthening International Peace" Stalin International Prize Committee has placed the name of an ordinary woman alongside the very famous figures of science, literature, and art. This woman's only merit lies in her understanding that the struggle for peace can become the main task of a person's life. I thank everyone, especially because this Stalin Prize has become the common property of the Belgian peace movement. Today the honor of this prize falls on me, and tomorrow we will jointly make greater contributions to the cause of peace, so as to live up to the honor of this prize.

    Mrs. Blum said that we have not forgotten that it is only because of the policies of the Soviet Union that my generation has learned, not only in theory but also in practice, that peace is an achievable and should be achieved goal. We must intensify the struggle for the unity of the working people, so that they can all unite to engage in the great common cause - the cause of peace. She said that for many people in Western Europe, the Stalin International Peace Prize is a new and valuable link between our people and the Soviet people, and the artificial barriers created by those who restrict cultural exchanges and international ties among the peoples of various countries can be eliminated through this.

    Mrs. Blum said that we, together with you, are entering a great historical era, in which people feel that they have the ability to transform the world and are getting closer and closer to the deepest secrets of life. People are using their scientific and technological discoveries to alleviate their labor and open up the path to a more free and happy life for themselves. In all of this scientific and spiritual activity of mankind, our main task remains the same as before: to make the people of all countries believe that they have a responsibility to carry out the greatest revolution in history, to change the relationship between people, between countries, and should do so by replacing violence with consultation, so that the light of peace shines all over the world. This is the most noble purpose of mankind.

    布伦姆夫人接受斯大林国际和平奖金
    【新华社十日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科九日讯：七月九日，在莫斯科克里姆林宫斯维德洛夫大厅中举行了将“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金授给比利时卓越的社会活动家、议员伊莎贝丽·布伦姆的仪式。
    参加这一隆重的仪式的有：苏联文化和艺术界领袖、莫斯科劳动人民和各社会团体的代表。
    作家爱伦堡把斯大林国际和平奖金得奖人的奖状和金质奖章授给布伦姆夫人。他在授奖发言中指出了布伦姆夫人多年来为和平、为加强各国人民的友谊所进行的伟大斗争。他衷心祝贺布伦姆夫人获得这一崇高的奖赏，希望她在争取各国人民的福利、争取人类幸福的崇高活动中取得新的成就。
    苏联建筑科学院院长、苏联拥护和平委员会委员莫尔德维诺夫，苏联妇女反法西斯委员会代表加加里娜，莫斯科加里宁毛织厂男女工人代表、著名的工业革新者科托娃，苏联文化工作者代表、苏联人民演员查列夫等人都在会上讲了话，对布伦姆夫人表示热烈的祝贺。他们指出，苏联人民以深深满意的心情获悉布伦姆夫人得到斯大林国际和平奖金的消息，并通过布伦姆夫人向在为世界和平进行斗争的比利时人民表示敬意。
    布伦姆夫人致答词说：“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金委员会把一个普通妇女的名字和非常著名的科学、文学、艺术工作者并列在一起，这个妇女的全部劳绩只不过在于她了解到了：争取和平的斗争可以成为一个人一生中的主要任务。我之所以感谢大家特别是由于这一斯大林奖金已成为比利时保卫和平运动所共有的财产。今天这一奖金的荣誉落到我的身上，明天我们要共同对和平事业作出更大的贡献，以不负这奖金的荣誉。
    布伦姆夫人说，我们没有忘记，只是因为苏联的政策，我这一代才不仅在理论上，而且还在实践中了解到和平是可以而且应当实现的目标。必须加紧争取劳动人民的团结，以使他们全体团结起来从事伟大的共同事业——和平事业。她说，对西欧的许多人来说，斯大林国际和平奖金是我们人民和苏联人民之间的新的、宝贵的联系，那些限制文化交流和国际联系的人在各国人民之间造成的人为障碍可以借此来消除。
    布伦姆夫人说，我们和你们一起，进入一个伟大的历史时代，在这个时代里，人们感到自己有能力改造世界，越来越接近生活中最深奥的秘密。人们以自己的科学和技术发现来减轻自己的劳动，为自己开辟通往更加自由、更加幸福的生活的道路。在这人类的全部的科学和精神的活动中，我们的主要任务仍然和以前一样：使各国人民相信他们有责任进行历史上最伟大的革命，改变人和人之间、国家和国家之间的关系，并应做到以协商代替暴力，使和平的光芒普照全世界。这就是人类最崇高的目的。
