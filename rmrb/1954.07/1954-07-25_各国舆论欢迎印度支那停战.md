Indonesian Newspapers

    Indonesian newspapers universally welcomed the signing of the Indochina armistice agreements.

    The Indonesian "People's Daily" said that the Indochina armistice is the greatest victory achieved by the principle of negotiation. Facts have proven that a five-power conference should be convened, and it is the most important and effective forum. The "People's Daily" pointed out that while the world is cheering the restoration of peace in Indochina, the likes of Dulles and Wilson in the United States are still clamoring for the organization of a Southeast Asia group to prepare for war.

    The "Indonesia Torch" newspaper's editorial on the 22nd stated that the agreements reached in Geneva are of particularly great significance to the entire world. The agreements currently reached indicate that the elements of peace and consultation can save the world from serious crises. Although this agreement is only the first step in resolving the Indochina issue, and more efforts are needed to maintain lasting world peace, the agreement has made people optimistic about the future situation of the world. The agreements reached in Geneva powerfully demonstrate that the desire for peace can defeat ambitions to take strong action.

    The "Indonesia Torch" said that it welcomes the Indochina ceasefire with pleasure and relief. This is a victory for the desire for peace achieved after three months of vigorous struggle at the Geneva Conference. This is a victory for the peace camp against the camp that always believes that the power of intimidation can achieve everything.

    The "Independent Newspaper" said that the Indochina armistice agreement is also beneficial to Indonesia, because the recognition of the importance of peace for the happy life of people in all countries and the maintenance of international relations has finally overcome the international tensions that have become a crisis of world war.

    "Indonesian News" said that the agreement marks the beginning of a change in the balance of world power in favor of peace. "Indonesian News" also pointed out that the United States tried its best to obstruct the conclusion of the armistice agreement, "but Dulles was defeated. His war plans have been rejected by the majority."

    "Great Indonesian Daily" said that all peace-loving people applaud the Indochina armistice agreement. The Geneva Conference proved that the settlement of international disputes must involve the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. The other major powers participating in the Geneva Conference – including the United States – have in fact recognized that the People's Republic of China must be invited to resolve Asian issues that are of interest to the People's Republic of China.

    The "Observer" editorial said that the Indochina armistice is a historic international event and should be warmly welcomed. The Indochina armistice cannot but make all those who recognize what war, massacre, and destruction between people mean feel relieved.

Pakistani Newspapers

    Pakistani newspapers generally commented on the signing of the Indochina armistice agreement.

    The "Today" newspaper published an editorial celebrating this new victory for the forces of peace. The editorial wrote: "The success of the Geneva Conference clearly confirms that communist and non-communist countries are able to resolve their disputes and ideological differences through negotiations, and at the same time, their coexistence is entirely possible." The newspaper said that the sympathy of the Pakistani people is on the side of the freedom-loving Vietnamese people.

    The "News Morning Post" said that all peace-loving people hope that the Indochina armistice will lead to the consolidation of peace in Southeast Asia. The newspaper emphasized that the colonial system that violates the will of the Asian people is bound to perish.

Japanese Public Opinion

    Japanese circles widely commented on the Indochina ceasefire.

    On the 22nd, all Tokyo newspapers published the news of the Indochina armistice agreement in a prominent position on the front page, and many newspapers published commentaries.

    The "Yomiuri Shimbun" said: "The success of the Geneva Conference is the result of the trend that the whole world recognizes that peace must be achieved through consultation."

    The "Mainichi Shimbun" believes that the signing of the Indochina armistice agreement is a "serious blow" to the United States' policy of strength. It said: The signing of the agreement is the first step towards realizing peaceful coexistence between East and West, and "shook the foundation of the United States' world strategy aimed at establishing an anti-communist alliance of allies."

    The "Nihon Keizai Shimbun" pointed out that China "has definitely gained the position of the world's leading country." It said: Without China's assistance, it would not have been possible to guide the Indochina armistice negotiations to a harmonious resolution. The "Asahi Shimbun" said that a strong public opinion has risen among the Japanese people that Japan should re-examine and adjust its relations with the People's Republic of China.

    The Left-wing Socialist Party issued a statement saying: Japan should break away from the Yoshida government and the US government's policy of organizing an Asian aggression bloc and coexist peacefully with China.

    The Right-wing Socialist Party believes that further efforts should be made to ease international tensions through consultation. The Right-wing Socialist Party emphasized that Japan should not participate in the US Southeast Asian aggression bloc.

    Japanese business leaders believe that the Indochina ceasefire will definitely help normalize international trade relations. Therefore, Japan should develop normal trade relations with China and other peaceful democratic countries. They advocate that Japan adopt a policy of "expanding the Japanese economy through trade rather than through aid."

Swiss Newspapers

    All major Swiss newspapers on the 21st gave priority to the news of the signing of the two ceasefire agreements for Vietnam and Laos that morning at the Palais des Nations. Newspaper editorials unanimously congratulated the restoration of peace in Indochina.

    The front page of "La Voix Ouvrière" under the headline "Peace Achieved in Indochina" published photos of Molotov, Zhou Enlai, and Pham Van Dong, as well as the key points contained in the draft document. Reporting on the events of the previous day, "La Voix Ouvrière" said that Cambodia tried to sabotage at the last minute, apparently at the instigation of the Americans, while the American representative did not actively participate in the discussions between the foreign ministers that finally led to an agreement on all major issues.

    "La Voix Ouvrière" published an editorial entitled "Long Live Peace": "The ceasefire agreements for Vietnam and Laos have been signed. The final difficulties were overcome at today's closing meeting, and one can imagine how happy people are about this. For many years, since the American imperialists madly and unscrupulously acted recklessly in order to dominate the world and deal with the socialist countries, the people of all countries in the world have never had such a joyful and hopeful thing as today.

    "During the twelve weeks of discussion, the policy of the Soviet Union and People's China, as well as the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, which was entirely for the sake of seeking peace, has become evident. The American ruling class has exposed themselves as the real war instigators in the face of world opinion. They have become even more isolated politically."

    "La Gazette de Lausanne" editorial said that the Geneva Conference has achieved concrete results. "The most concrete and encouraging point of the Geneva Accords is that there is no more bloodshed now." It has ended the massacre that the vast majority of French people increasingly considered unjustified.

    "Journal de Genève" said that this is an extremely encouraging thing, because continuing the war in the current situation is both absurd and inhumane.

Swedish Newspapers

    The Swedish "Stockholm News" published an editorial commenting on the conclusion of the agreement on the cessation of hostilities in Indochina. The editorial believes that the actions of the US delegation in Geneva prove that US diplomacy has "discredited to some extent" and believes that the Indochina ceasefire will certainly strengthen the feeling that international tensions have been eased. The editorial said that there are still many disputes between East and West to be resolved, but the Geneva Conference shows that results can be obtained through consultation by frankly expressing one's opinions to each other.

专栏：

    各国舆论欢迎印度支那停战
      印尼报纸
    印尼报纸普遍欢迎印度支那停战协定的签订。
    印尼“人民日报”说，印度支那停战是协商原则所取得的最大的胜利。事实证明，五大国会议是应该召开的，它是最重要的和最有效的讲坛。“人民日报”指出，当全世界正在为印度支那的恢复和平而欢欣鼓舞的时候，美国的杜勒斯、威尔逊之流却仍旧在叫嚣组织东南亚集团以准备战争。
    “印尼火炬报”二十二日的社论说，在日内瓦达成的协定对全世界来说是具有特别重大意义的。目前达成的协定表明，和平与协商的因素是可以把世界从严重危机中拯救出来的。虽然这种协定仅仅是解决印度支那问题的第一个步骤，而且要保持世界持久和平还需要作更多的努力，但是协定已使人们对世界未来的形势表示乐观。在日内瓦达成的协定有力地表明，和平的愿望是能够击败想采取实力行动的野心的。
    “印尼火炬报”说，它以愉快和宽慰的心情欢迎印度支那停火。这是和平愿望在日内瓦会议上经过三个月有力的斗争后取得的一个胜利。这是和平阵线对那个总认为用恫吓的力量就可以达到一切要求的阵线的一个胜利。
    “独立报”说，印度支那停战协定对印尼也是有利的，因为对于和平对各国人民幸福生活和维持国际关系的重要性的认识，终于战胜了已成为世界大战的危机的国际紧张局势。
    “印尼新闻”说，协定标志着世界力量的对比开始发生了有利于和平的变化。“印尼新闻”还指出，美国曾竭力阻挠缔结停战协定，“但是杜勒斯遭到了失败。他的战争计划为大多数人摒弃了。”
    “大印尼报”说，一切爱好和平的人民都欢呼印度支那的停战协定。日内瓦会议证明，解决国际争端必须有苏联和中华人民共和国参加。参加日内瓦会议的其他大国——包括美国在内——事实上已承认，必须邀请中华人民共和国来解决同中华人民共和国具有利害关系的亚洲问题。
      “观察报”的社论说，印度支那停战是一件具有历史性的国际大事，应予以热烈欢迎。印度支那停战，不能不使所有认识到人和人之间的战争、屠杀和毁灭意味着什么的人们感到如释重负。
      巴基斯坦报纸
    巴基斯坦报纸普遍对印度支那停战协定的签订发表评论。
      “今天报”发表社论庆祝和平力量的这一个新的胜利。社论写道：“日内瓦会议的成功明显地证实，共产主义国家和非共产主义国家是能够通过谈判方式来解决它们之间的争端和思想上的分歧的，同时，它们的共处是完全可能的。”报纸说，巴基斯坦人民的同情是在爱好自由的越南人民方面的。
      “新闻晨报”说，全体爱好和平的人们都希望印度支那的停战能导致东南亚和平的巩固，报纸着重指出，违反亚洲人民意志的殖民制度是必然要遭到灭亡的。
      日本舆论
    日本各界广泛评论印度支那停火。
    二十二日东京所有报纸都用首页的显著地位刊载印度支那停战协议的消息，许多报纸发表了评论。
      “读卖新闻”说：“日内瓦会议的成功，是全世界都承认必须通过协商达到和平的趋势的结果。”
      “每日新闻”认为：印度支那停战协议的签订是对美国实力政策的“严重打击”。它说：协议的签订是实现东西方和平共处的第一步，并且“动摇了美国的目的在于建立盟国反共大联盟的世界战略的基础”。
    “日本经济新闻”指出：中国“已经肯定地取得了世界上居于首位的国家的地位”，它说：没有中国的协助，把印度支那停战谈判引导到和谐的解决是不可能的。“朝日新闻”说：在日本人民中间已兴起一种强有力的舆论，认为日本应该重新审查和调整它和中华人民共和国的关系。
    左派社会党发表声明说：日本应该摆脱吉田政府和美国政府组织亚洲侵略集团的政策，和中国和平共处。
    右派社会党认为应当进一步努力通过协商来缓和国际紧张局势。右派社会党强调日本不应参加美国的东南亚侵略集团。
    日本企业界人士认为：印度支那的停战必定会有助于国际间贸易关系的正常化。因此，日本应当和中国以及其他各和平民主国家发展正常的贸易关系。他们主张日本采取“通过贸易而不是通过援助来扩大日本经济”的政策。
    瑞士报纸
    瑞士的各大报纸二十一日都以首要地位刊载了当天清晨在国联大厦进行的越南和老挝的两个停火协定签字的新闻。各报社论都一致庆贺印度支那和平的恢复。
    “工人之声报”的第一版在“印度支那获致了和平”的标题下刊登着莫洛托夫、周恩来和范文同的照片以及文件草案中所包含的要点。“工人之声报”报道前天的事件时说，柬埔寨试图在最后一分钟进行破坏，这显然是由美国人指使的，而美国代表却不积极参加使所有主要问题最后获致协议的外长之间的讨论。
    “工人之声报”以“和平万岁”为题发表社论说：“越南和老挝的停火协定已经签字了。今天闭幕会议上克服了最后的一些困难，可以想像人们如何为此欢欣鼓舞。多少年来，自从美帝国主义者为了要统治全世界和对付各社会主义国家疯狂而不择手段地一味蛮干以来，全世界各国人民从未有过像今天这样令人欢欣和满怀希望的事情。
    “在十二个星期的讨论中，苏联和人民中国以及越南民主共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的完全为了谋求和平的政策，已成为有目共睹的了。而美国统治阶级则在世界舆论面前暴露了他们自己是真正的战争挑拨者。他们在政治上已经更加孤立了。”
      “洛桑日报”的社论说，日内瓦会议已经获得了具体的结果。“日内瓦协定的最具体和最令人鼓舞的一点是现在不再进行流血战争了。”它已结束了绝大多数法国人民越来越认为毫无理由的屠杀。
      “日内瓦日报”说，这是一件极其令人鼓舞的事情，因为在目前的情形下继续战争是既荒谬而又惨无人道的。
      瑞典报纸
    瑞典“斯德哥尔摩新闻”发表社论，评论印度支那缔结停止敌对行动的协定。社论认为，美国代表团在日内瓦的所作所为证明美国外交已“在某种程度上威信扫地”，并认为印度支那停战将一定会加强关于国际紧张局势得到缓和的感觉。社论说，东西方之间还有许多争端尚待解决，但是日内瓦会议表明，在坦白地相互表示自己的意见的情况下，通过协商的方式是可以获得结果的。
