    First Session of the First People's Congress Held in Deyang County, Sichuan
    The first session of the first People's Congress of Deyang County, Sichuan Province, was held from June 22nd to 25th. The meeting enthusiastically discussed the draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China and passed a resolution supporting the draft Constitution.
    More than 270 people's representatives attended the meeting. After listening to the report on the draft Constitution, they held group discussions. During the discussion, the representatives had the deepest understanding of Article 2 of the draft Constitution. People's Representative Huang Daiqun (farmer) said: "Since the general election, our township has completed major tasks such as grain planned purchase and planned supply, and the publicity and implementation of the state's general task during the transition period through the township People's Congress. The township People's Congress has truly become the state power organ of the whole township. Now that the draft Constitution stipulates this, I will definitely play the role of a people's representative better under the supervision of the masses." People's Representative Yi Wengui (worker) said: I feel honored and also feel a great responsibility, because the draft Constitution stipulates that the state is led by our working class; and it also stipulates that state affairs and local affairs are discussed and decided by the representatives of the National People's Congress and the people's congresses at all levels. I believe that managing state affairs in this way will definitely ensure that our country becomes richer and stronger day by day. People's representatives from rural areas, when discussing Articles 7 and 8 of the draft Constitution, all believed that these two articles strengthened their confidence in taking the road of mutual aid and cooperation. People's Representative Yang Baitong (farmer) said: "These two articles are like a bright lamp, illuminating our hearts. Our mutual aid team must actively create conditions and strive to transform into agricultural production cooperatives as soon as possible." People's Representative Tang Tianxiu (female), head of the Changjiang Agricultural Production Cooperative, said that she would take a proactive attitude to better attract individual farmers to organize, and help mutual aid teams create conditions for establishing cooperatives, as a gift to the promulgation of the draft Constitution.
    The meeting also specifically discussed the issue of organizing the people of the county to discuss the draft Constitution. People's Representative Hu Xingshun (porter) prepared to convey the content layer by layer, aiming at the scattered characteristics of porters, and earnestly organize workers to discuss. People's Representative Zhang Shizao (farmer) prepared to combine the content of conveying the draft Constitution when deploying summer production tasks in the village. Female People's Representative Ding Shixiu prepared to not only convey the content at the township women's representative meeting and mutual aid team leader meeting, but also use leisure time such as during breaks and before and after meals to carry out individual publicity to the masses. After heated discussions, all the representatives unanimously passed a resolution supporting the draft Constitution.
    The meeting also discussed the work of the county people's government in the past year and specific measures for the future. The spirit of democracy was fully developed at the meeting, and the more than 220 people's proposals received were carefully studied. Finally, the meeting elected representatives to the Sichuan Provincial People's Congress.

    四川德阳县召开首届首次人民代表大会会议
    四川省德阳县在六月二十二日到二十五日召开第一届第一次人民代表大会会议。会议热烈讨论了中华人民共和国宪法草案，并作出了拥护宪法草案的决议。
    出席会议的有二百七十多个人民代表。他们在听了关于宪法草案的报告后，分组进行了讨论。在讨论中，代表们对宪法草案第二条体会最深。人民代表黄代群（农民）说：“普选以后，我们乡里对粮食计划收购计划供应和宣传贯彻国家在过渡时期的总任务等重大任务，都是通过乡人民代表大会来完成的；乡人民代表大会真正成了全乡的国家权力机关。现在宪法草案把这一条规定下来，我一定在群众的监督下，更好地起到人民代表的作用。”人民代表易文贵（工人）说：我感到光荣，也感到责任重大，因为宪法草案规定国家由我们工人阶级来领导；又规定国家大事和地方上的事由全国人民代表大会和地方各级人民代表大会的代表来讨论决定。我相信：按照这样方式来管理国家事务，一定能保证我们的国家一天比一天富强。来自农村的人民代表讨论到宪法草案第七条、第八条时，都认为这两条规定更加坚定了自己走互助合作道路的信心。人民代表杨白通（农民）说：“这两条规定像一盏明灯一样，照亮了我们的心坎，我们的互助组一定积极创造条件，争取早日转为农业生产合作社。”人民代表、长江农业生产合作社社长汤天秀（女）表示要采取积极的态度，更好地吸引单干农民组织起来，帮助互助组创造条件办社，作为对宪法草案公布的献礼。
    会议还具体讨论了组织全县人民讨论宪法草案的问题。人民代表胡兴顺（搬运工人）准备针对搬运工人分散的特点，层层进行传达，认真组织工人讨论。人民代表张世早（农民）准备在村上布置夏季生产任务时，结合传达宪法草案的内容。女人民代表丁世秀准备除了在全乡妇女代表会、互助组长会上进行传达外，还要利用歇凉、饭前饭后等空隙时间向群众进行个别宣传。经过热烈讨论以后，全体代表一致通过了拥护宪法草案的决议。
    会议还讨论了一年来县人民政府的工作和今后的具体措施。会上充分发扬了民主精神，对收到的二百二十多件人民提案认真地进行了研究。最后，会议选出了四川省人民代表大会的代表。
