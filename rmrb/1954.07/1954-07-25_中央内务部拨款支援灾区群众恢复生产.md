    The Central Internal Affairs Department Allocates Funds to Support Disaster Area Residents in Resuming Production
    The Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government has allocated 321 billion yuan in relief funds to help people in disaster areas overcome difficulties and resume production.
    Since June and July, continuous heavy rains in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River have caused flooding in some areas. To help people in disaster areas overcome difficulties and resume production, the Central Ministry of Internal Affairs recently allocated 321 billion yuan in relief funds to disaster areas. At the same time, it instructed the disaster-stricken areas that, in addition to providing support to the affected people through mutual assistance among the masses and government loans, it is also necessary to do a good job in relief work based on realistic assessments.
    Currently, some of the areas affected by the floods have established production and disaster relief committees to carry out various post-disaster relief and resettlement work. For example, Hubei Province recently distributed 64 billion yuan in relief funds allocated by the central government and Central-South Bureau to disaster victims. In Hengyang County, Hunan Province, 36 farming households whose houses were washed away by mountain floods have been repaired with government assistance. At present, all localities are stabilizing the emotions of disaster victims and supporting them to quickly resume production through relief work and other measures.

    中央内务部拨款支援灾区群众恢复生产
    中央人民政府内务部拨出救济款三千二百一十亿元帮助灾区群众解决困难，恢复生产。
    六、七月以来，长江中下游各省连降暴雨，部分地区酿成水灾。中央内务部为帮助灾区群众解决困难，恢复生产，最近曾陆续拨付灾区救济款三千二百一十亿元。同时指示受灾地区，除通过群众互助，政府贷款，对受灾群众进行扶持外，还必须实事求是地做好救济工作。
    目前，遭受水灾的部分地区都已经成立了生产救灾委员会，进行各项善后救济和安置工作。如湖北省最近已将中央、中南拨给的六百四十亿元救济款，陆续发放到灾民手中。湖南省衡阳县被山洪冲倒房屋的三十六户农民，经过政府帮助后，已经得到了修复。现在各地都正在通过救济等工作安定灾民的情绪，扶持灾民迅速恢复生产。
