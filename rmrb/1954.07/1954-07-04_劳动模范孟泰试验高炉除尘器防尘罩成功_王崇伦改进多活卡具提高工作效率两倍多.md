Labor Model Meng Tai Successfully Tests Dust Cover for Blast Furnace Dust Collector
Wang Chonglun Improves Multi-Jaw Fixture, Increasing Work Efficiency by More Than Two Times

    Anshan City Special-Class Labor Model Meng Tai's blast furnace "dust collector dust cover," which he began painstakingly researching two years ago, has recently been successfully tested. The appearance of the "dust collector dust cover" will solve the problem of gas ash flying around in the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Ironmaking Plant, which is of great benefit to improving the working conditions of ironmaking workers.
    The "dust collector dust cover" is a dust prevention device installed at the gas ash outlet of the dust collector. When the gas ash is swept from the blast furnace dust collector into the train car, the "dust collector dust cover" tightly covers the train car to prevent the gas ash from flying around. In the past, because the ironmaking plant did not have this kind of equipment, every time dozens of tons of gas ash were swept from the blast furnace dust collector into the car, the gas ash would fly everywhere, like dark clouds filling the sky above the blast furnace, making it impossible to see people on the opposite side, and the ironmaking workers were choked and unable to breathe. After this iron-containing gas ash is inhaled into people's lungs, it is easy to get the occupational disease "pneumoconiosis." When these gas ashes fly into the machinery and equipment on the blast furnace, it is easy to cause machine failure and affect safe production. Meng Tai had long been determined to solve this problem. After more than two years of research and many tests, his wish was finally realized. Now this "dust collector dust cover" has begun to be used on a blast furnace in the ironmaking plant. Soon, other blast furnaces in the ironmaking plant will also be equipped with this dust prevention equipment. (Xinhua News Agency)

    Production innovator Wang Chonglun recently improved another tool—
  the "multi-jaw fixture." The use of this tool can save the time of manufacturing fishplate "dies" and work auxiliary time, increasing work efficiency by more than two times. Wang Chonglun has already used this "multi-jaw fixture" to complete a batch of urgently needed fishplate "die" tasks ahead of schedule, and supplied the Anshan Iron and Steel Medium-Sized Rolling Mill's needs for manufacturing fishplates in a timely manner. This tool can also be applied to milling machines and grinders.
    After returning from the Soviet Union to attend the "May Day" celebration, Wang Chonglun put forward the suggestion of improving the "multi-jaw fixture." After the draft of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China was announced, it further encouraged his creative enthusiasm. With the strong support of the Anshan Iron and Steel Tool Workshop, after more than ten days of careful study, it was successfully tested on June 28 and began to be officially used.

    劳动模范孟泰试验高炉除尘器防尘罩成功
    王崇伦改进多活卡具提高工作效率两倍多
    鞍山市特等劳动模范孟泰在两年前开始苦心研究的高炉“除尘器防尘罩”，已经在最近试验成功。“除尘器防尘罩”的出现，将解决鞍山钢铁公司炼铁厂瓦斯灰飞扬的问题，对改善炼铁工人的劳动条件有很大好处。
    “除尘器防尘罩”是装在除尘器瓦斯出灰口的一种防尘设备。从高炉除尘器里把瓦斯灰打扫到火车厢里时，“除尘器防尘罩”就紧密地罩在火车厢上，防止瓦斯灰飞扬。过去炼铁厂因为没有这种设备，每当从高炉除尘器里把几十吨瓦斯灰打扫到车厢时，瓦斯灰就飞扬四起，像乌云一样弥漫在高炉上空，对面看不见人，炼铁工人被呛得透不出气来。这种带有铁质的瓦斯灰被吸到人的肺里以后，很容易得“尘肺”职业病。这些瓦斯灰飞到高炉上的机器设备里，容易使机器发生故障，影响安全生产。孟泰早就下决心要解决这个问题。经过两年多的研究和多次试验，他的愿望终于实现了。现在这个“除尘器防尘罩”已在炼铁厂的一座高炉上开始使用。不久，炼铁厂的其他高炉也都要安装这种防尘设备。　（新华社）

    生产革新者王崇伦最近又改进了一项工具——
  “多活卡具”。使用这种工具可以节省制造鱼尾板“冲模”的时间和工作辅助时间，使工作效率提高两倍以上。王崇伦已经用这种“多活卡具”，提前完成了一批急需的鱼尾板“冲模”的任务，及时地供应了鞍钢中型轧钢厂制造鱼尾板的需要。这种工具在铣床和磨床上也能适用。
    王崇伦从苏联参加“五一”节观礼回国以后，就提出了改进“多活卡具”的建议。中华人民共和国宪法草案公布以后，更加鼓舞了他的创造热情。他在鞍钢工具车间的大力支持下，经过十多天的认真钻研，在六月二十八日试验成功，并开始正式使用。　（新华社）
