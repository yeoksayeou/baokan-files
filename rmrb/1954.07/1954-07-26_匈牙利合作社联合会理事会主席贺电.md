We sincerely congratulate this congress on being able to achieve many successes, so that after the successful conclusion of this congress, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, Chinese cooperatives can promote the development of socialist commodity circulation with rapidly increasing strength, better meet the growing needs of the Chinese working people, further consolidate the alliance between the working class and the working peasants, and advance the socialist transformation of the national economy.

Hungarian cooperative workers realize that the rapid development of the cooperative movement in the People's Republic of China and the effective labor of Chinese cooperative workers are a huge source of strength for defending and consolidating world peace. Therefore, in the peace camp headed by the Soviet Union, the powerful fortress for defending world peace and security, Chinese cooperatives actively promote the further consolidation and development of the People's Republic of China.

    匈牙利合作社联合会理事会主席德根·易姆莱致中华全国合作社第一次代表大会的贺电说，我们谨代表匈牙利农村消费合作社社员、合作社机构的领导人员和合作社工作者，向中华人民共和国拥有一亿多社员的全国合作社代表大会致以热烈的同志般的祝贺。
    匈牙利合作社工作者以极大的热情和兴趣注视着中华人民共和国力量的增长和国际威信的提高，注视着中国经济的迅速发展和中国人民文化和物质福利的不断提高，以及新中国成立以来所获得的巨大成就。我们衷心祝贺这次代表大会能够得到很多成就，以便使中国合作社在这次代表大会顺利结束以后，在中国共产党的领导下，以迅速增长的力量促进社会主义商品流转的开展，更好地满足中国劳动人民日益增长的需求，进一步地巩固工人阶级和劳动农民之间的联盟，推进国民经济的社会主义改造工作。
    匈牙利合作社工作者意识到，中华人民共和国合作社运动的迅速发展和中国合作社工作者的有成效的劳动，是保卫和巩固世界和平的力量的巨大泉源。因此在以保卫世界和平和安全而斗争的强大堡垒——苏联为首的和平阵营中，中国合作社积极地促进着中华人民共和国进一步的巩固和发展。
