    Beijing, Tianjin, and Shenyang – The organization of the Communist Party of China in Beijing, Tianjin, and Shenyang has seen great development in the past year. In Beijing, workers, farmers, teachers, and students, under the education and cultivation of the Communist Party, and especially inspired by the Party's General Line for the transition period, have continuously improved their political consciousness. Many have become advanced elements on the production and cultural fronts, and nearly ten thousand have been gloriously admitted as members of the Communist Party of China. In the past year, the Party organization in Beijing has developed a large number of new members in industrial and mining enterprises. Among these new members, there are many model workers, advanced producers, and excellent technical workers. The Party Committee of the Jingxi Mining Bureau admitted a total of 149 employees to the Party from January to May this year, of whom 53 were model workers or advanced workers. In the largest construction worker contingent in Beijing, Party organizations have been generally established in the past year, and Party building work has been carried out steadily and carefully. Many outstanding workers, cadres, and engineering technicians have been absorbed into the Party organization. In the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation organizations and handicraft production cooperatives in the suburbs, the Party organization has also developed. Among the new Party members developed in rural areas, many are the backbone elements of collective farms, agricultural production cooperatives, and mutual aid teams. They have promoted the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement with their exemplary behavior. In the handicraft production cooperatives where Party organizations have been established, members, under the leadership of Communist Party members, actively find ways to improve production. Development of Party work has also been carried out in private factories as a priority. After the education of the General Line, many employees of private factories have drawn a clear line between themselves and the bourgeoisie ideologically and have requested to join the Party. For example, the Qunli Iron Factory in Xuanwu District had no Party members before "July 1st" last year, but now it has developed seven Party members and established a branch. The branch actively leads the factory's employees in supervising and urging the capitalists to improve management and has achieved results. In the past year, Party building work in the cultural and educational departments has also been strengthened. The increase in the number of Party members in universities and colleges has provided a reliable guarantee for teaching reform work. Many young lecturers and teaching assistants in universities and colleges have improved their consciousness in teaching work and studying the Soviet Union and have joined the Communist Party of China. Many outstanding young students, conscientiously implementing Chairman Mao's instructions on "good health, good study, good work," have gloriously joined the Party. A group of outstanding teachers and staff members in primary and secondary schools have also joined the Party organization.

    In 1953, Tianjin developed 8,694 new Party members and established 280 new branches. Currently, the number of Party members in the city is approximately 6.6 times that of the early days of liberation in 1949, and Party members of worker origin account for more than half of the total number of Party members in the city. The Party building work in Tianjin is combined with production and various central tasks. Party committees at all levels have conscientiously implemented the regulations of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, adhered to the standards of Party members, and adopted the policy of consolidating and developing forward, ensuring the quality of Party members. The new Party members developed in recent years are all activists who have emerged in production and various practical work. Many model workers and advanced figures in the working class, such as Liu Changfu, Li Zhaozhen, Wang Deshan, and Yan Chunhong, have been successively admitted to the Party. The organizations of various factories under the Tianjin Municipal Heavy Industry Committee system have admitted more than 730 outstanding employees to the Communist Party of China in the past year, most of whom are excellent technical workers. Due to the increase in the proportion of Party members among the workers, the Party's supervisory and guaranteeing role in industrial production has been strengthened. In the rural areas of the suburbs, except for a few dozen branches, most of the Party's grassroots organizations have undergone rectification, and the class consciousness and political and ideological level of Party members have been improved, thus playing an exemplary and leading role in production. This year, the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China will continue to develop the Party's ranks according to the policy of consolidating and developing forward, while continuing to consolidate the Party's organization, establish the normal order of branch work, improve the Party's combat effectiveness and the class consciousness and political and ideological level of Party members, and strengthen the Party's unity to ensure the smooth realization of the Party's General Line in the transition period.

    According to statistics by the end of May this year, the number of Communist Party members in Shenyang has more than doubled compared with the end of 1952. The proportion of workers in the Party is also constantly increasing. At the end of 1953, workers accounted for 49.56 percent of all Party members in the city. By May of this year, it had increased to over 52 percent. Of the new Party members developed in the city last year, workers accounted for more than 61 percent. Of the new Party members developed in the city from January to May this year, those in the industrial and transportation systems accounted for 69 percent, and the vast majority of these new Party members are industrial workers. The vast majority of the newly admitted Communist Party members are model figures and activists on various production fronts or work and study posts. At the Shenyang City Labor Model Representative Conference held this year, 38 of the 50 labor models elected were Communist Party members. According to a recent survey by the Organization Department of the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China in 19 factories, government offices, schools and other units, among the 405 new Party members developed in these units in the past six months, there were 116 various advanced model figures, including 5 labor models at the Shenyang City level, 39 labor models in their respective enterprises, 35 advanced producers, 28 advanced workers in government offices, and 3 outstanding students. A large proportion of the new Party members were selected from outstanding members of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League. In 1953, 7,758 outstanding Youth League members in the city were gloriously approved to join the Communist Party. In addition, judging from the distribution of Party members, the number of Party members among employees of private enterprises and members of handicraft production cooperatives, where there were fewer Party members in the past, has also increased considerably in the past six months. In order to commemorate the 33rd anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, many Party organizations in the city have decided to discuss the admission of new Party members on "July 1st" and hold oath-taking ceremonies for new Party members. According to incomplete statistics, more than 1,000 new Party members in 33 units will solemnly swear an oath to join the Communist Party on this day.

    北京天津沈阳党的队伍日益壮大
    一年来吸收大批产业工人入党
   【本报讯】中国共产党在北京市、天津市和沈阳市的组织一年来有很大发展。北京市工人、农民、教职员和青年学生，在共产党的教育和培养下，一年以来特别在党在过渡时期总路线的启发下，不断地提高了政治觉悟，许多人成为生产和文化各个战线上的先进分子，其中将近一万人已被光荣地接收为中国共产党党员。过去一年来，北京市党的组织在工矿企业方面发展了大批新党员。在这些新党员中，有许多劳动模范、先进生产者和优秀的技术工人。京西矿务局党委会从今年一月到五月，共吸收了一百四十九名职工入党，其中有五十三名是劳动模范或先进工作者。在北京市最大的建筑工人队伍中，一年来普遍建立了党的组织，并稳步地慎重地进行了建党工作。许多优秀的工人、干部和工程技术人员都被吸收到党的组织中来。在郊区农业互助合作组织和手工业生产合作社中，党的组织也有了发展。农村发展的新党员中，有许多是集体农庄、农业生产合作社和互助组的骨干分子。他们以自己的模范行为推动了互助合作运动的发展。在建立了党的组织的手工业生产合作社中，社员们在共产党员的带动下，积极想办法改善生产。在私营工厂中也重点进行了发展党的工作。经过总路线的教育，私营工厂职工不少人划清了与资产阶级的思想界限，并提出入党要求。例如宣武区群力铁工厂去年“七一”前一个党员也没有，现在已发展了七名党员，建立了支部。支部积极领导全厂职工监督和督促资方改善经营管理，取得了成绩。一年来，文教部门的建党工作也加强了。在高等学校中，党员人数的增加使得教学改革工作有了可靠的保证。许多高等学校的青年讲师和助教，在教学工作和学习苏联的过程中提高了自己的觉悟，参加了中国共产党。许多优秀青年学生，认真贯彻毛主席关于
  “身体好、学习好、工作好”的指示，光荣地参加了党。在中、小学校中也有一批优秀的教职员参加了党的组织。
    天津市一九五三年发展了新党员八千六百九十四人；新建支部二百八十个。目前，全市党员约相当于一九四九年解放初期的六点六倍，其中工人成份的党员已占全市党员总数的一半以上。天津市的建党工作，是与生产和各项中心工作结合进行的，各级党委都认真执行了中共中央的规定，坚持了党员标准，采取巩固地向前发展的方针，保证了党员的质量。几年来发展的新党员都是在生产和各项实际工作中涌现出的积极分子。工人阶级中的许多劳动模范和先进人物如刘长福、李兆珍、王德山、阎春洪等先后被吸收入党。中共天津市重工业委员会系统所属各厂的组织一年多来接收了七百三十多名优秀职工加入了中国共产党，他们绝大部分是优秀的技术工人。由于党员在工人群众中比重的增长，加强了党在工业生产中的监督和保证作用。在郊区农村中，除二十几个支部外，大部分党的基层组织都经过了整顿，党员阶级觉悟和政治思想水平有所提高，因此，在生产中发挥了模范带头作用。今年中共天津市委将根据巩固地向前发展的方针，继续发展党的队伍，同时并继续巩固党的组织，树立支部工作的正常秩序，提高党的战斗力及党员的阶级觉悟和政治思想水平，增强党的团结，以保证党在过渡时期的总路线的顺利实现。
    沈阳市到今年五月底的统计，共产党员比一九五二年年底增加了一倍多。党内工人成份的比重也在不断增加着。在一九五三年年底，全市党员中工人出身的占百分之四十九点五六，到今年五月已增加到百分之五十二强。去年一年全市发展的新党员中，工人占百分之六十一以上。今年一月到五月全市发展的新党员中，工业和交通运输系统的占百分之六十九，这些新党员绝大部分是产业工人。新被接收的共产党员绝大部分都是各个生产战线或工作、学习岗位上的模范人物和积极分子。沈阳市今年举行的工厂企业劳动模范代表会议上，当选的五十名劳动模范中有三十八名是共产党员。据中共沈阳市委员会组织部最近在十九个工厂、机关、学校等单位的调查，这些单位半年来发展的四百零五名新党员中，各种先进模范人物就有一百一十六名，其中有沈阳市一级劳动模范五名，本企业单位的劳动模范三十九名，先进生产者三十五名，机关先进工作者二十八名，优秀学生三名。新党员中还有很大一部分是从优秀的中国新民主主义青年团团员中选拔出来的。一九五三年，全市有七千七百五十八名优秀的青年团员光荣地被批准参加共产党。另外，从党员分布情况来看，过去党员较少的私营企业职工和手工业生产合作社社员中，半年来，党员的数量也有了相当的增加。为了纪念中国共产党成立三十三周年，全市许多党组织已决定在“七一”讨论接收新党员，并举行新党员入党宣誓的仪式。据不完全统计，将有三十三个单位的一千多名新党员在这一天庄严地宣誓加入共产党。
