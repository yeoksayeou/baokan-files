The 1,510 newly elected People's Assessors in various districts of Tianjin have begun participating in trials. According to incomplete statistics from the Tianjin Municipal People's Court in recent months, 501 People's Assessors have participated in trials at the municipal or district People's Courts, and 649 civil and criminal cases have been concluded after being heard with assessors.

The broad masses of citizens have expressed great welcome upon seeing the assessors they elected participating in judicial work. Many litigants are actively inviting People's Assessors from their neighborhood to help resolve their disputes. Among the 55 cases recently accepted by the People's Court of the Third District, six were cases where the parties involved voluntarily invited People's Assessors to participate in the trial. The participation of People's Assessors makes it easier to understand the case and absorb the opinions of the masses, thus enabling the People's Court to handle various cases correctly and promptly. The People's Court of the Third District once compared cases of similar complexity at the same time: for 19 cases where People's Assessors participated, it took an average of 21 days from case acceptance to conclusion, with fewer than two court sessions; while for another 19 cases without assessors, it took an average of 73 days from case acceptance to conclusion, with more than four court sessions. Cases concluded with the participation of People's Assessors also rarely result in appeals by the parties involved. Among the 33 cases in which the People's Court of the Fifth District invited People's Assessors to participate, none were appealed after conclusion. In the cases concluded by the People's Court of the Third District in February and March, 20% required the court to enforce the judgment because one party failed to comply; while in cases heard with assessors, only 3.6% of judgments were not complied with.

In participating in trials, People's Assessors have realized the importance and glory of their responsibilities and are participating in the work with great enthusiasm and responsibility. The seven People's Assessors from Huangjia Garden in the Fifth District investigated all ongoing lawsuits in their neighborhood in advance, gaining a thorough understanding of the cases. Assessor Zhang Xiulan, during the trial of defendant Gao Shijie for bigamy and abandonment, refused repeated solicitations and threats from the defendant, exposing his illegal actions in court, leaving the defendant with no way to deny them. Female worker Guo Wenzhen, due to a dispute with her mother-in-law, proposed a divorce from her husband Feng Xuebo. Assessor Hu Zhen, understanding that the couple's relationship was usually good and that they should not divorce, went to Guo Wenzhen's parents' home three times and to her factory four times to persuade her. As a result, Guo Wenzhen voluntarily withdrew the original case, and the relationship between husband and wife, and between daughter-in-law and mother-in-law, was restored. The participation of People's Assessors in case investigations, mediation, judgments, and other activities has educated the surrounding masses about abiding by the law. Assessor Lü Zongtang, during the trial of Bian Zhoushi for abusing her daughter-in-law, organized local residents to discuss the sentencing of Bian Zhoushi, submitting many specific opinions from the masses for the People's Court to consider. After the case was judged, Lü Zongtang organized residents to discuss the People's Court's judgment and used this example to educate families with similar disputes in the area. After the People's Court of the Eighth District handled the housing dispute between resident Yin Zihe and eight tenants, other 32 tenants related to the case but not involved in the litigation, resolved their disputes on their own based on the policies and laws of the People's Government, thanks to the publicity and mediation by the People's Assessors.

    天津各区新选出的人民陪审员已参加陪审
    天津市各区新选举出的一千五百一十名人民陪审员，已开始参加陪审。据天津市人民法院近几个月来不完全统计，已有五百零一名人民陪审员分别到市或区人民法院参加陪审，有六百四十九件经过陪审的民事和刑事案件已经结案。
    广大市民看到自己选举出的陪审员参加审判工作，表示非常欢迎。不少正在诉讼的当事人，主动去邀请本街的人民陪审员来解决自己的纠纷。第三区人民法院最近受理的五十五件案件中，有六件是当事人自动邀请人民陪审员参加陪审的。人民陪审员参加陪审，更便于了解案情和吸取群众的意见，因此使人民法院对各种案件能正确及时地处理。第三区人民法院曾在同一时间内，找出复杂程度相同的案件作过比较：有人民陪审员参加陪审的十九件案件，从收案到结案平均需要二十一天，开庭不到两次；而另外没有陪审员参加陪审的十九件案件，从收案到结案平均需要七十三天，开庭在四次以上。经过人民陪审员参加陪审的案件结案后，当事人再提起上诉的也很少。第五区人民法院邀请人民陪审员参加陪审的三十三件案件中，结案以后没有一件再提起上诉。第三区人民法院在二三月份已结案的案件中，有百分之二十因当事人一方不执行判决，对方又申请法院执行；而经过陪审的案件，判决后不执行判决的仅占百分之三点六。
    人民陪审员在参加陪审中，体会到自己职责的重大和光荣，都非常热情负责地参加陪审工作。第五区黄家花园的七名人民陪审员，在参加陪审前就把本街所有的正在诉讼的案件，都事先调查清楚，掌握了案情。陪审员张秀兰在陪审被告高世杰重婚遗弃一案时，曾拒绝了被告多次的拉拢和威胁，当庭揭露了被告的犯法行为，使被告人无法抵赖。女工郭文珍因为和婆婆闹气，提出和丈夫冯学波离婚；陪审员胡震了解到他们夫妻平日的感情还好，不应当离婚，便三次到郭文珍的娘家，四次到她的工厂向郭文珍进行说服动员，结果郭文珍自动地撤回了原案，夫妻、婆媳之间重新和好。人民陪审员在参加对案件的调查、调解、判决等活动中，使周围群众受到了守法的教育。陪审员吕宗棠在陪审边周氏虐待儿媳的案件时，曾组织当地居民讨论对边周氏的量刑问题，将群众提出的很多具体意见交给人民法院参考；这个案件判决后，吕宗棠又组织居民们讨论人民法院的判决，并用这个实例向当地有类似纠纷的家庭进行宣传。第八区人民法院在处理居民尹子和与八户房客的房屋纠纷案以后，经过人民陪审员的宣传和调解，和这案件有关但未参加诉讼的其他三十二户房客，都根据人民政府的政策和法令把纠纷自行解决了。
