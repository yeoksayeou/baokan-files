Xinhua News Agency, July 30th -- British officials and newspapers have expressed dissatisfaction with the provocative speech made by Syngman Rhee in the United States Congress on the 28th, in which he clamored for an "attack" on China. A British Foreign Office spokesman said on the 29th that Syngman Rhee's suggestion to attack China would "hardly" receive the support of the British government.

    The Conservative Party's "Yorkshire Post" wrote in an editorial on the 29th: "It is simply unbelievable: at a time when people around the world still have vivid memories of wars before the atomic age, how can any responsible person deliver a speech like the one he (Syngman Rhee) delivered in the United States Congress yesterday?" The editorial said: "There is no doubt about his purpose. He is trying to launch a full-scale Third World War and subject us to hydrogen bomb attacks."

    The "Scotsman" said in an editorial on the same day that Syngman Rhee's speech was "foolish." The editorial said that Syngman Rhee's "demand to attack Communist China" was "shockingly irresponsible behavior." The editorial concluded: "It is a pity that (the US) Congress gave Syngman Rhee the opportunity to continue his nonsense."

    不满李承晚挑衅性叫嚣
    【新华社三十日讯】英国官方和报纸评论对李承晚二十八日在美国国会发表的叫嚣“进攻”中国的挑衅性演说表示不满。英国外交部发言人二十九日说，李承晚的进攻中国的建议“很难”得到英国政府的支持。
    保守党的“约克郡邮报”二十九日在社论中写道：“这简直令人难以置信：在世界上的人们对于原子时期以前的战争记忆犹新的时候，任何负责的人怎么能够发表像他（李承晚）昨天在美国国会发表的那样的演说。”社论说：“人们对于他的目的再也没有任何疑问了。他正在设法发动全面的第三次世界大战，而使我们遭到氢弹的轰炸。”
     “苏格兰人报”在同一天的社论中说，李承晚的演说是“愚蠢的”。社论说，李承晚“要求进攻共产党中国”，这是“令人吃惊的不负责任的行为”。社论最后说：“（美国）国会给予李承晚继续胡闹的机会确是憾事。”
