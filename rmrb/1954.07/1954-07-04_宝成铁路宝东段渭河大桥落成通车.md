Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, July 3rd: The Weihe River Bridge on the Bao (Baoji) Dong (Dongheqiao) section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway was successfully completed on June 28th and a ceremony was held on July 1st to mark its completion and opening. A gaily decorated train passed over the bridge for the first time.

The completion and opening of this bridge is a great victory in the new line project of the Baodong section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway. With the Weihe River Bridge in operation, the track-laying project will continue south of Baoji. From now on, a large amount of machinery, building materials, grain, and daily necessities required for the construction of the Baodong section, especially in the Qinling Mountains, will be transported by train, creating favorable conditions for accelerating the progress of the Baodong section project to the south; at the same time, transportation costs can also be greatly reduced.

Construction of the Weihe River Bridge began on February 8th this year. In order to complete the lower foundation work before the flood season, thousands of workers worked day and night. They overcame many difficulties and finally completed the concrete pouring of the last pier on May 7th. During the erection of the steel beams, the bridge builders completed the erection of all the steel beams in just four days, ensuring that the Weihe River Bridge was completed two days ahead of schedule before "July 1st."

    宝成铁路宝东段渭河大桥落成通车
    【新华社西安三日电】宝成铁路宝（鸡）东（河桥）段渭河大桥已在六月二十八日胜利完工，并在七月一日举行了落成通车典礼。大桥上第一次通过了盛装结彩的列车。
    这座大桥建成通车，是宝成铁路宝东段新线工程中的巨大胜利。通过渭河大桥，铺轨工程将继续向宝鸡以南进行。从此，宝东段沿线特别是秦岭山区施工所需大量的机械、建筑器材、粮食和日用品等将由火车源源运到，为加速宝东段工程向南进展创设了有利条件；同时运输费用也可大大节省。
    渭河大桥从今年二月八日开始动工兴建。为要在洪水期前把下部基础工程做完，千百个工人昼夜不停地工作着。他们克服了重重困难，终于在五月七日完成了最后一个桥墩的混凝土灌注工作。在架设钢梁过程中，架桥工人又以四天时间的速度把全部钢梁架设完毕，保证了渭河大桥在“七一”前夕提前两天完工。
