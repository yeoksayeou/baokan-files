The news of the agreement reached at the Geneva Conference on the restoration of peace in Indochina has filled us with boundless excitement here in Beijing. The end of this eight-year war fully accords with the wishes of the people of Indochina, the people of France, and all peace-loving people around the world. Except for a handful of warmongers in the ruling circles of the United States, people all over the world will rejoice at this historically significant achievement.

The conclusion of the Indochina issue agreement marks a new milestone in the peace movement. The idea of peaceful negotiation has been embraced by hundreds of millions of people, and the principle of resolving international disputes through peaceful negotiation and peaceful coexistence has been endorsed by an increasing number of countries. The force of peace is unstoppable, and any forces and conspiracies hostile to peace will inevitably meet with shameful defeat.

The conclusion of the Indochina issue agreement also profoundly reflects the reality of Asia. Only by respecting the national rights of the Asian people to peace, independence, democracy, and unity can Asian problems be resolved. Any attempt to defy this reality and pursue a policy of strength by creating divisions and organizing opposing military blocs will inevitably meet with shameful failure.

The restoration and continued consolidation of peace in Indochina, and the guarantee by the countries concerned of the thorough implementation of the Indochina issue agreement, will be a good start and example, helping to promote collective peace and security in Asia and the world, thereby further easing international tensions and reducing and eliminating the danger of war.

During the Geneva Conference, the delegation of the People's Republic of China made unremitting efforts to promote the agreement, embodying the strong will of the people of the whole country to strive for peace in Asia and the world. For the first time, the People's Republic of China, as one of the world's major powers, consulted with major countries on major international issues, made its own contributions, and won praise from widespread world public opinion. The people of the whole country are extremely excited and proud of the efforts and achievements of Premier Zhou and the entire delegation. The people of the whole country will strengthen unity, work actively and hard to build the motherland, support the cause of defending peace with practical actions, and, with full confidence, work with the peace-loving people and relevant countries around the world to ensure the thorough implementation of all agreements, and to heighten vigilance, prevent and smash any conspiracies to sabotage peace in Indochina.

    谭平山的谈话
    日内瓦会议关于印度支那恢复和平问题达成协议的消息传到北京，我们感到无限的兴奋。这一场历时八年的战争的结束，完全符合印度支那人民、法国人民以及全世界爱好和平人民的愿望。除了美国统治集团一小撮好战分子之外，全世界人民都将为这一具有重大历史意义的成就而欢欣鼓舞。
    印度支那问题协议的达成，标志着和平运动的新里程。和平协商的思想已经掌握了千百万人民，以和平协商的方式解决国际争端与和平共处的原则已为越来越多的国家所赞成。和平的力量是阻挡不住的，任何敌视和平的势力和阴谋必将遭到可耻的挫败。
    印度支那问题协议的达成，还深刻地反映了亚洲的现实。只有尊重亚洲人民的和平、独立、民主、统一的民族权利，才能解决亚洲的问题，任何敢于违抗这个现实，推行制造分裂、组织对立的军事集团的实力政策，亦必将遭到可耻的失败。
    印度支那和平的恢复和继续巩固，有关各国保证印度支那问题协议的彻底实施，将是一个良好的开端和范例，有助于促进亚洲及世界的集体和平与安全，从而更进一步缓和国际紧张局势，减少和消灭战争危险。
    在日内瓦会议中，中华人民共和国代表团坚忍不渝地努力促成协议，体现了全国人民争取亚洲及世界和平的坚强意志。中华人民共和国第一次以世界大国之一的身份，与各大国一起协商国际重大问题，作出了自己的贡献，获得了世界广泛舆论的赞扬。全国人民对周总理和代表团全体的努力和成就，感到极大的兴奋和光荣。全国人民将加强团结，积极努力，建设祖国，以实际行动支持保卫和平的事业，信心百倍地与全世界爱好和平的人民和有关各国一起保证各项协议的彻底实现，并提高警惕，防止并粉碎对印度支那和平的任何阴谋破坏活动。
