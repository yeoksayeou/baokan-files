Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, July 9th: The Geneva Conference's restricted session discussing the restoration of peace in Indochina issued the following communiqué on the 9th:

"The delegations of the nine countries continued to discuss the issue of restoring peace in Indochina at the restricted session on July 9th. As agreed, the date of the next meeting will be decided through consultation between the two chairmen."

Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, July 9th: This correspondent reports: According to information obtained here, the delegations of China, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and the Soviet Union all spoke at the restricted session on the 9th. As is known, the delegations of France, Laos, and Cambodia all referred at the meeting on July 6th to the provisions in the Chinese delegation's proposal of June 16th regarding the cessation of the introduction of new troops, military personnel, and armaments into Laos and Cambodia after the ceasefire, and regarding separate consultations on the issue of these countries importing defensive weapons. To this end, the Chinese delegation expressed important opinions on the above-mentioned issues at the meeting on the 9th. The Chinese delegation suggested that, in accordance with the agreement of the restricted session on June 19th, representatives of the command headquarters of both sides of Cambodia and Laos should discuss the issue of the quantity and types of self-defense weapons for the two countries, as well as other relevant issues, and submit reports and recommendations to the conference after reaching a certain agreement.

It is reported that the Chinese delegation pointed out that the cessation of the introduction of new troops and military personnel, as well as various weapons and ammunition, from outside Indochina after the ceasefire is one of the most important conditions for ensuring that hostilities do not recur. Taking into account the request made by the Cambodian delegation regarding the import of self-defense weapons from abroad, the Chinese delegation proposed in its proposal of June 16th that the issue of weapons imported by the two countries for self-defense should be considered as a special issue. The Chinese delegation pointed out that since these two countries are importing weapons for self-defense, the types and quantities of these weapons must obviously be limited to what is necessary for self-defense.

Regarding the issue of not establishing foreign military bases in the countries of Indochina after the ceasefire, the Chinese delegation believes that the establishment of foreign military bases is incompatible with the principle of limiting the import of weapons to what is necessary for self-defense. Consultations on the issue of importing self-defense weapons must therefore be conducted on the basis of the principle of prohibiting the establishment of foreign military bases. The Cambodian delegation also stated at the plenary session on June 8th that it had no intention of allowing the establishment of foreign bases on its territory. Therefore, the Chinese delegation believes that the Cambodian and Laotian delegations will have no objections on this issue.

Regarding the issue of employing foreign military personnel to train troops raised by the Laotian and Cambodian delegations, the Chinese delegation pointed out that the Laotian delegation stated on July 6th that it hoped that military instructors and technical personnel from the French Union would train the troops established by Laos for defense. The Cambodian delegation also mentioned at the plenary session on June 10th that there were some French officers serving as advisors, experts, and technical personnel in the Cambodian army. The Chinese delegation stated that, in view of the relationship between Laos and Cambodia and the French Union, the issue of the two countries needing military instructors and technical personnel from the French Union to assist in training troops could be studied. The Chinese delegation believes that this issue should be discussed together with the issue of withdrawing all foreign armed forces and foreign military personnel from Laos and Cambodia.

The Chinese delegation's suggestions and opinions were supported by the Soviet delegation. It is reported that the Soviet delegation pointed out that the conference's study of the implementation of the ceasefire in Laos and Cambodia should begin with the issue of stopping the import of troops, military personnel, and weapons into the two countries. The Soviet delegation believes that it must be stipulated that the import of weapons will not lead to a situation or reach a quantity that threatens neighboring countries. At the same time, the countries importing weapons should not lose their sovereignty as a result. Therefore, the imported weapons should be limited to what is necessary for self-defense.

The Soviet delegation also believes that the delegations of various countries have been approaching agreement on the issue of ceasefire supervision for three weeks. On issues where there are still differences of opinion among the parties, it is necessary to continue to make efforts to demonstrate a desire to seek solutions. Therefore, difficulties should not be created in the opinions that have already been approached. Concrete measures should now be determined and certain documents should be prepared. The Soviet delegation is willing to make every effort to resolve all unresolved issues.

It is reported that the delegations of the United States, France, and Cambodia also spoke at the meeting on the 9th. In its speech, the United States delegation attempted to find excuses for foreign countries to establish military bases in Laos and Cambodia, while the Cambodian delegation requested that only the "quantity" of weapons and military personnel imported from outside the country be restricted, without restricting the "source and quality" of these weapons and military personnel. In other words, Cambodia can obtain weapons and military personnel of any "quality," including those not necessary for self-defense, from any "source," especially the United States. It is not difficult to see that the speeches of the United States and Cambodian delegations can only have one purpose: to use "self-defense needs" as an excuse to achieve non-self-defense purposes—threatening the security of neighboring countries.

It is reported that the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam expressed specific opinions on the objects of supervision and other issues at the meeting on the 9th. The delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam first pointed out the common points of the opinions of the delegations of various countries on the issue of supervision. Regarding the issue of the objects of supervision, the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believes that this cannot be determined until the content of the ceasefire agreement is determined. But in general, this ceasefire agreement includes military issues throughout Indochina. In order to make supervision effective, supervision should be considered from the perspective of the entire issue of Indochina.

The delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam pointed out that the military issues directly related to the ceasefire issue are mainly: simultaneous, comprehensive, and complete ceasefire; demarcation lines between the areas of concentration of the belligerent forces and the subsequent demarcation of demilitarized zones; the transfer of hostile forces to their respective concentration areas; the withdrawal of foreign troops and personnel; the prohibition of the introduction of weapons, ammunition, troops, and military personnel; the prohibition of the establishment of foreign military base in the three countries; and the exchange of prisoners of war and detained civilians. All these measures are related to the ceasefire and should be implemented simultaneously with the ceasefire.

The delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believes that the Joint Commission should be the organ for supervising the ceasefire agreement and conducting consultations between the two sides. The Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission should be an organ for supervision and mediation. And the guaranteeing countries should bear the burden of high-level arbitration.

The delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam also believes that a general Joint Commission and a general Neutral Nations Commission should be organized in Indochina. At the same time, each of the three countries can have a local Neutral Nations Commission and a local Joint Commission in order to implement the general and special measures of each country. Certain characteristics should be taken into account for Laos, especially for Cambodia, particularly in the withdrawal of foreign troops and the prohibition of the introduction of new troops, weapons, and foreign military personnel. However, these cannot change the basic principles of supervision, and the objects and methods of supervision should be the same in the three countries.

The delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam finally pointed out that the work of the restricted session has made some progress, and the talks between the representatives of the command headquarters of both sides have also made progress. The delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam hopes that the work of the representatives of the command headquarters of both sides can produce satisfactory results so as to submit recommendations to this conference. As for the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, it will make every effort in this direction.

    日内瓦会议限制性会议继续讨论印度支那问题
    中越苏代表团就停战监察问题发言
    【新华社日内瓦九日电】日内瓦会议讨论恢复印度支那和平问题的限制性会议九日发表公报如下：
    “九国代表团在七月九日的限制性会议中继续讨论恢复印度支那和平问题。根据协议，下次会议的日期将由两个主席协商决定。”
    【新华社日内瓦九日电】本社记者报道：根据此间得到的消息，中国、越南民主共和国和苏联的代表团都在九日的限制性会议上发了言。大家知道，法国、老挝和柬埔寨的代表团都曾在七月六日的会议上谈到中国代表团六月十六日的建议中关于停战后停止向老挝和柬埔寨运入新的军队、军事人员和军火以及关于这些国家输入自卫武器的问题应另行协商等项的规定。为此，中国代表团在九日的会议上就上述问题发表了重要意见。中国代表团建议：根据六月十九日限制性会议的协议，由柬埔寨和老挝的双方司令部代表就两国的自卫武器的数量和种类问题以及其他有关问题进行商谈，并在达成一定的协议后向会议提出报告和建议。
    据悉，中国代表团指出，停战后停止从印度支那境外运入新的部队和军事人员以及各种武器和弹药，是保证敌对行动不致再起的最重要的条件之一。由于考虑到柬埔寨代表团所提出的有关自国外运入自卫武器的要求，中国代表团在六月十六日建议中曾提出：关于两国为自卫所需而运入的武器的问题，应作为一个专门问题予以考虑。中国代表团指出，既然这两个国家输入武器自卫，那么这些武器的种类和数量显然必须限于为自卫所必需。
    关于停战后不得在印度支那各国建立外国军事基地的问题，中国代表团认为，建立外国军事基地和将武器的输入限于自卫所需的原则是不相符合的。有关运入自卫武器问题的协商，因此也必须在禁止建立外国军事基地的原则的基础上进行。柬埔寨代表团在六月八日的全体会议上也曾表示无意允许在它的领土上建立外国基地，因此中国代表团相信柬埔寨和老挝代表团在这一问题上不会有什么反对意见。
    关于老挝和柬埔寨代表团所提出的聘用外国军事人员训练军队的问题，中国代表团指出：老挝代表团在七月六日曾表示希望由法兰西联邦军事教官和技术人员来训练老挝为防御而建立的军队，柬埔寨代表团在六月十日的全体会议上也曾提到柬埔寨军队里有一些法国军官担任顾问、专家和技术人员。中国代表团表示，鉴于老挝和柬埔寨同法兰西联邦的关系，两国需要法兰西联邦军事教官和技术人员来协助训练军队的问题是可以研究的。中国代表团认为，这一问题应在讨论撤退在老挝和柬埔寨的一切外国武装力量和外国军事人员问题时一并加以讨论。
    中国代表团的建议和意见得到了苏联代表团的支持。据悉，苏联代表团指出，会议对老挝和柬埔寨实施停火问题的研究，应从停止向两国输入军队、军事人员和武器的问题开始。苏联代表团认为，必须规定：武器的输入将不致产生这样的情况或达到这样的数量，以致形成对邻国的威胁。同时，输入武器的国家也不应因此而失去其主权。因此，输入的武器应限于自卫所需。
    苏联代表团还认为：三个星期以来各国代表团在停战监察问题上意见已趋接近。在各方意见仍有距离的问题上，就有必要继续努力表现出努力寻求解决的愿望。因此，不应在已接近的意见中再来制造困难。现在应确定具体办法并准备出一定的文件。苏联代表团愿尽一切努力以求解决所有没有解决的问题。
    据悉，在九日的会议上发言的还有美国、法国和柬埔寨的代表团。美国代表团在发言中企图为外国在老挝和柬埔寨建立军事基地找寻借口，而柬埔寨代表团要求只对从国境外运入的武器和军事人员的“数量”加以限制，而不限制这些武器和军事人员的“来源和质量”。换句话说，柬埔寨可以从任何“来源”、特别是美国取得包括非自卫所必需的、任何“质量”的武器和军事人员。不难看出，美国和柬埔寨的代表团的这些发言只能有一个目的，那就是：以“自卫需要”为借口，来达到非自卫性质的目的——威胁邻国的安全。
    据悉，越南民主共和国代表团在九日的会议上，就监察的对象等问题发表了具体的意见。越南民主共和国代表团首先指出了各国代表团关于监察问题的意见的共同点。关于监察的对象问题，越南民主共和国代表团认为，在停战协定的内容未确定以前，这一点还不能确定。但总的说来，这一停战协定包括印度支那全境的军事问题。为了使监察有效，应从全印度支那的整个问题来考虑监察。
    越南民主共和国代表团指出，同停火问题直接联系的军事问题主要是：同时全面、完全停火；划分交战部队集结区之间的分界线及以后划定非军事区；将敌对军队转移到各自的集结区；外国军队和人员的撤退；禁止运入武器、弹药、军队和军事人员；禁止在三国建立外国军事基地；交换战俘及被拘平民。所有这些措施都是同停火相关连的，应同停火同时执行。
    越南民主共和国代表团认为，联合委员会应该是对停战协定进行监察并在双方之间进行协商的机关。中立国监察委员会应是一个监察和进行调解的机关。而保证国应担负高级的仲裁。
    越南民主共和国代表团还认为，应该在印度支那组织一个总的联合委员会和一个总的中立国委员会，同时，三国可各有一个地方中立国委员会和一个地方联合委员会，以便执行每一国的一般的和特殊的措施。对老挝，尤其是对柬埔寨应照顾到某些特点，特别在撤退外国军队和禁止运入新的军队、武器和外国军事人员方面。但这些不能改变监察的基本原则，监察的对象和方式在三国应是一样的。
    越南民主共和国代表团最后指出，限制性会议的工作已有了些进展，双方司令部代表的会谈也有了进展，越南民主共和国代表团希望双方司令部代表的工作能得出令人满意的结果，以便向本会议提出建议。至于越南民主共和国代表团，它将尽量朝这方面努力。
