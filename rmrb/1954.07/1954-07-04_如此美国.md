Such is America

“The Wives and Mothers of the Forgotten”

    According to an Agence France-Presse dispatch from New York on April 20: On April 20, a group of women in New York City, with the words "The Wives and Mothers of the Forgotten" written on their bodies, went to the United Nations office to find the American representative, Lodge, to ask him to find their husbands and sons. These women are the wives and mothers of American soldiers who were declared "missing" by the American military authorities in the war of aggression against Korea. They chose such a time on the eve of the Geneva Conference to find the U.S. representative to the United Nations, because they had their own ideas. They fantasized that after the American representative arrived in Geneva, he could truly represent their wishes and seek a reasonable solution to the Korean issue so that they could see their "missing" relatives again. However, as everyone knows, the so-called "missing" declared by the American military authorities is often a euphemism for "killed in action." On December 31 last year, the U.S. Department of the Army and the Department of the Air Force admitted that 3,650 American officers and soldiers who had been declared "missing" in the war of aggression against Korea were "presumably dead"! In this light, it is "presumably" impossible for these "wives and mothers of the forgotten" to see their "missing" relatives again.
    This group of "wives and mothers of the forgotten" are being deceived to this extent!

Dickinson's "Crime"

    On May 4, the U.S. Army Court "sentenced" Dickinson, a repatriated former American prisoner of war, to "ten years of hard labor." The "crime" was that Dickinson participated in discussions criticizing the United States during his captivity in Korea and signed a "peace petition" (United Press International, Washington, May 4).
    Everyone remembers that Dickinson was repatriated on October 21 last year. An Associated Press dispatch from Seoul on October 22 last year said that the 23-year-old corporal said after returning that his greatest desire was to "meet his family and live a happy life." On December 23 last year, the U.S. Allied Forces Command broadcast to American prisoners of war in Songgok-ri, saying that "Corporal Dickinson has returned home and reunited with his family," and deceived their prisoners of war by saying that they "don't need to worry about their safety" after returning. But what was the result? After Dickinson returned to the United States, he did not live a "happy life" or reunite with his "family." What Dickinson encountered was the gloomy U.S. Army Court and a "ten years of hard labor" sentence!
    The "crime," then: because Dickinson had a desire to live a peaceful life. From this innocent sentence against Dickinson, people can see how ferocious the American rulers' fear of peace is!

Oppenheimer's Ordeal

    According to an Associated Press dispatch from Washington on April 13, the famous American atomic scientist Oppenheimer was suddenly removed from his position as a member of the Atomic Energy Commission by the American authorities. Not only was he removed from his position, but the American president also asked the American secret service agency—the "Federal Bureau of Investigation"—to investigate Oppenheimer and then decide how to deal with him.
  　What "crime" did Oppenheimer commit? It is said that "he opposed and delayed the development of the hydrogen bomb." As everyone knows, the hydrogen bomb is a weapon of mass destruction of humanity, and the United States is trying to use this weapon to realize its ambition to dominate and enslave the world. Oppenheimer felt the serious responsibility of his participation in the manufacture of this weapon and therefore expressed his opposition. This angered the American rulers and made him a target of persecution. Oppenheimer's ordeal shows the desperate situation that American science has fallen into today, with no room for existence except to serve the war of slaughtering humanity.

The Rampancy of Mental Illness

    According to the American "Daily Worker" on February 26, the number of people suffering from mental illness in New York State's state-run mental hospitals is approaching 120,000. Now, the problem of mental illness is not only in New York State, but has become an important issue at the U.S. Governors' Conference. According to a special committee that specializes in studying this issue: In the past ten years, the number of mental hospitals in the United States has increased by 28 percent each year. Michigan Governor Williams said: This year, in every seven hundred families in the United States, one relative is sent to a mental hospital every day. New York Governor Dewey planned in his budget for this year to use $122.2 million for mental illness management fees and $65 million for the construction of new hospitals. Michigan Governor Williams said: The U.S. government spends nearly $500 million annually on mental hospitals.
    One can imagine that as long as the American rulers continue to incite war fever and continue to promote McCarthyism, the number of mentally ill people in the United States will continue to increase, and the U.S. government will spend more and more money on building mental hospitals.

    Wall Street's "Uninvited Guest"

    American monopoly capitalists are most afraid of talking about economic crises. However, in fact, the signs of an economic crisis in the United States have become more and more obvious day by day. It seems impossible not to mention it, so what should be done? You can only say it quietly. As a result, words such as "adjustment," "normal adaptation to new situations," "silence phenomenon," and "downward trend" have appeared in American newspapers to avoid the ominous word "crisis." Moreover, some people feel uncomfortable even saying it quietly, so they flatly deny it. American "economists" say: "We (the United States) will not, should not, and cannot have an economic crisis!"
    However, whether you say it quietly or deny it outright, it is very difficult to prevent the arrival of this uninvited guest from Wall Street—the economic crisis. (Attached picture)
    The American capitalist says: "Speak softly! Let's not talk about him, lest we wake him up!"

    如此美国
    “被遗忘者的妻子和母亲”
    据法新社四月二十日纽约电讯消息：四月二十日，纽约市有一群身上写着“被遗忘者的妻子和母亲”字样的妇女，到联合国的办公地点去找美国代表洛奇，要求他找回他们的丈夫和儿子。这些妇女就是被美国军事当局宣布为在侵朝战争中“失踪”的美国士兵的妻子和母亲。她们选择了日内瓦会议前夕那样一个时候，去找美国驻联合国的代表，是有他们的想法的。她们幻想着美国代表到了日内瓦后，能真正代表她们的愿望，求得朝鲜问题的合理解决，以便能使她们重新看到“失踪”的亲人。但是，大家知道，美国军事当局宣布的所谓“失踪”，往往就是“阵亡”的代名词。去年十二月三十一日，美国陆军部和空军部就承认，曾被它们宣布为
  “失踪”的三千六百五十名侵朝美军官兵“想必已经阵亡”了！这样看来，这些“被遗忘者的妻子和母亲”要想再看到她们那些“失踪”的亲人，“想必”也是不可能的了。
    这群“被遗忘者的妻子和母亲”竟被欺骗到这种地步！
    狄根逊的“罪名”
    五月四日，美国陆军法庭“判决”了被遣返的前美国战俘狄根逊“十年劳役”。“罪名”是：狄根逊在朝鲜的被俘期间参加了批评美国的讨论会，在“和平请愿书”上签了名（合众社华盛顿五月四日电）。
    大家还记得，狄根逊是在去年十月二十一日被遣返的。去年十月二十二日的美联社汉城电讯说，这个二十三岁的下士回去以后，曾对人说，他最渴望的是“会见家属和过快乐的生活”。去年十二月二十三日，美国的联军司令部对松谷里的美国战俘广播时，说是“狄根逊下士已回家和他的家人团聚”了，并欺骗他们的战俘说，回去后“用不着为他们的安全担心”。但是，结果怎样呢？狄根逊回到美国以后，并没有过到什么“快乐的生活”，也没有和他的“家人团聚”，狄根逊碰到的是阴森森的美国陆军法庭，是一张“十年劳役”的判决书！
    “罪名”呢：因为狄根逊有一个要过和平生活的愿望。从对狄根逊这一无辜的判决中，人们可以看到美国统治者害怕和平的面目是多么狰狞！
    奥本海迈的遭遇
    据美联社华盛顿四月十三日电讯报道，著名的美国原子科学家奥本海迈的原子能委员会委员的职务，忽然被美国当局解除了。解除职务不算，美国总统还要美国特务机关——“联邦调查局”对奥本海迈进行调查，然后决定对他的处理。
  　奥本海迈犯了什么“罪”呢？据说“他曾反对并延缓发展氢弹”。大家知道，氢弹是大规模毁灭人类的武器，美国正在企图利用这种武器实现它统治和奴役世界的野心。奥本海迈感到了他参加制造这种武器的严重责任，因而表示了反对，这样就触怒了美国的统治者，成为被迫害的对象。奥本海迈的遭遇说明了今天美国科学已经陷入何等绝望的境地，除了为屠杀人类的战争服务，就没有存在的余地。
    精神病患的猖獗
    据二月二十六日美国“工人日报”记载，目前在纽约州州立的各精神病院中，患病的人数已接近十二万人。现在，这个精神病患的问题，不仅在纽约这个州里，而且在美国州长联席会议上已成为重要的议题之一。据专门研究这个问题的一个特别委员会说：近十年来，美国精神病院的数目每年要增加百分之二十八。密执安州的州长威廉士说：今年美国每七百个家庭中，每天就要有一个亲人送入精神病院去。纽约州州长杜威在他今年度预算中计划：用一亿二千二百万美元作为精神病的管理费，用六千五百万美元作为新病院的修建费。密执安州州长威廉士说：美国政府每年支出近五亿美元给精神病院。
    人们可以想到，只要美国统治者继续煽动战争狂热，继续推行麦卡锡主义，美国的精神病患者还会越来越多，美国政府花在建筑精神病院的经费也会越来越多的。
      华尔街的“不速之客”
    美国垄断资本家最怕说起经济危机。可是，事实上美国经济危机的征象已经一天天地明显了。不说似乎又不可能，那末，怎么办呢？只好说得小声点了。于是，美国报纸上就出现了“调整”、“对新情况的正常的适应”、“沉寂现象”、“下降趋势”等等含混的字眼，以回避“危机”这个不祥的字眼。而且有人连小声点说也觉得不舒服，于是就绝口否认，美国“经济学家”说：“我们（美国）是不会有，不应有，而且也不能有经济危机的！”
    然而，不管是说得小声点或是绝口否认，要阻止这位华尔街的不速之客——经济危机的到来是很困难的。（附图片）
    美国资本家说：“轻一点！我们不要谈他吧，以免把他吵醒了！”
