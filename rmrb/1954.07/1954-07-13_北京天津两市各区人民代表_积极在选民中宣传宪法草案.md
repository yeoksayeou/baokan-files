    People's Representatives from Districts in Beijing and Tianjin Actively Promote the Draft Constitution Among Voters
    People's representatives from the people's congresses of various districts in Beijing and Tianjin are actively promoting the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China to the voters. In recent days, voters in many factories, construction sites, and streets in Beijing have gathered to hear the people's representatives convey the situation and resolutions of the district people's congress meetings. Discussions on the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China and resolutions endorsing the Draft Constitution were an important part of the communication. The representatives regard reporting to voters as a major responsibility to the voters. They prepare carefully, generally holding forums to exchange views before reporting. Some representatives also studied the characteristics of their electoral districts and the demands of the voters to do a good job of reporting. Voters enthusiastically participated in the voter meetings convened by the people's representatives. At the voter meeting held in the Xiaojingchang electoral district, more than 1,500 people, including workers, students, women, industrialists, businessmen, and Catholics, participated. At the meeting, the voters felt a greater sense of glory as masters of their own affairs from the representatives' reports. Many district people's representatives have become active in promoting and discussing the Draft Constitution. Many people also serve as leaders of the draft constitution discussion groups after their report. They use their own personal experiences to promote the constitution among the masses of voters they are in contact with. Li Deshou, a Hui worker from the Beijing People's Printing Factory, preached the provisions concerning ethnic minorities in the Draft Constitution to more than 300 Hui people while performing prayers at the Niujie Mosque on July 2. Yang Deliang, the Imam of the Niujie Mosque, explained the Draft Constitution to the Hui people at every "Juli Day." Tian Dama and Li Ruiting, people's representatives of Xidan District, also served as heads of the Draft Constitution discussion group, actively leading the masses in discussion. Tian Dama also often visited the masses to gather questions.
    After the closing of the people's congresses in the various districts of Tianjin, many districts formulated plans for organizing district people's representatives to convey the resolutions of the meetings to the voters. As of July 8, people's representatives from the first, third, fourth, sixth, and seventh districts had successively begun to carry out communication and propaganda activities among the voters, mobilizing the masses of the city to deeply unfold the promotion and discussion of the Draft Constitution. Before in-depth communication, many districts carried out detailed and thorough preparations. Districts two, three, five, and seven have conducted or are conducting a second round of training for all district reporters, propagandists, and propaganda backbones after the closing of the meeting. On July 4th and 5th, Xiang Wenquan, deputy head of the third district, gave a report to more than 1,300 party propagandists and propaganda backbones in the district, focusing on explaining some issues related to the constitution. Districts two and five also separately organized district people's representatives on July 8 to continue reading and discussing the Draft Constitution in order to better convey it to the voters. The communication work of the people's representatives of each district is mostly carried out systematically and in groups, and closely cooperates with the reporters and propagandists of each district to carry out propaganda together.

    北京天津两市各区人民代表
    积极在选民中宣传宪法草案
    北京市和天津市各区人民代表大会代表积极向选民宣传中华人民共和国宪法草案。连日来，北京市很多工厂、工地、街道的选民纷纷集会，由区人民代表传达区人民代表大会会议的情况和决议。各区人民代表大会会议讨论中华人民共和国宪法草案的情形和拥护宪法草案的决议，是传达中的一项重要内容。代表们把向选民作传达看做是对选民负责的大事。他们慎重地进行准备工作，一般都在传达前举行座谈会交换意见。有些代表还研究了本选区的特点和选民的要求，以便做好报告工作。选民们参加人民代表所召集的选民大会非常踊跃。小经厂选区举行的选民大会上，参加的有工人、学生、妇女、工商业者、天主教徒等共一千五百多人。在大会上，选民们从代表向他们作传达报告这件事情中，更增加了人民当家作主的光荣感。许多区人民代表已成为宣传和讨论宪法草案的积极分子，不少人在报告后，还担任宪法草案讨论小组的组长。他们以自己亲身的感受，向所联系的选民群众进行宣传。北京人民印刷厂回族工人李德寿七月二日在牛街清真寺作礼拜时，就向三百多回民宣传了宪法草案中有关少数民族方面的规定。牛街清真寺教长杨德亮在每次“聚礼日”都向回民讲解宪法草案。西单区人民代表田大妈、李瑞亭也当了宪法草案讨论小组的负责人，积极领导群众进行讨论。田大妈还经常到群众家里进行访问，搜集问题。
    天津市市内各区人民代表大会会议闭幕以后，许多区制定了关于组织区人民代表向选民传达会议决议的计划。到七月八日止，全市已有第一、三、四、六、七等五个区的人民代表在选民中陆续开始传达和宣传活动，动员全市人民群众深入展开宪法草案的宣传和讨论。在深入传达以前，许多区进行了细致而周密的准备工作。二、三、五、七等区，在会议闭幕以后，都分别对全区报告员、宣传员和宣传骨干分子进行了或正在进行第二次训练。在七月四、五两日，三区副区长相文泉向全区一千三百余名党的宣传员和宣传骨干分子作了报告，着重对有关宪法的一些问题进行了解释。二、五等区，并于七月八日分别单独组织区人民代表，继续阅读和讨论宪法草案，以便更好地向选民们进行传达。各区人民代表的传达工作，多是按系统、分片进行，并紧密配合各区的报告员和宣传员共同进行宣传。
