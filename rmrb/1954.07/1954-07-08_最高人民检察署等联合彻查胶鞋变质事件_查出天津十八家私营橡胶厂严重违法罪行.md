The Supreme People's Procuratorate, in conjunction with the People's Revolutionary Military Commission of the Central People's Government, the Ministry of Light Industry of the Central Government, the People's Supervisory Committee and the Political and Legal Committee of the North China Administrative Council, the Logistics and Quartermaster Production Department of the North China Military Region, the Tianjin People's Procuratorate, and relevant Party and government organs and trade unions in Tianjin Municipality and districts, formed a joint inspection team from February 13 to March 18 to conduct a comprehensive investigation into the illegal incident reported in this newspaper on January 14, in which Tianjin Local State-Owned Rubber Factory and some private manufacturers cut corners in the processing and manufacturing of military rubber shoes for the Volunteer Army. During the inspection process, the joint inspection team not only further confirmed the illegal dereliction of duty by relevant cadres of the Tianjin Local State-Owned Rubber Factory, but also found that private rubber manufacturers had committed serious illegal and criminal acts of cutting corners and stealing state assets in this processing order. According to the statistics of the joint inspection team, eighteen private rubber factories stole more than 3.25 billion yuan of state property through illegal means such as falsely reporting costs, cutting corners, and stealing and replacing raw materials. Due to shoddy workmanship and other bad behavior, about 50% of the military rubber shoes they processed and manufactured deteriorated, making them unusable or not durable, causing a loss of more than 5.26 billion yuan to the state. The Supreme People's Procuratorate has instructed the Tianjin People's Procuratorate to file a public prosecution with the Tianjin People's Court, requesting that the cadres who violated the law and neglected their duties and the奸商 who committed serious "five poisons" crimes be punished according to law.

The processing and manufacturing of this batch of military rubber shoes took place from November 1951 to July 1952, during the active period of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements. Among all the military rubber shoes processed, the processing quantity of eighteen private rubber factories such as Yufu, Zhenhai, Dalu, and Guoguang accounted for 61.7%, the processing quantity of Tianjin Local State-Owned Rubber Factory accounted for more than 21%, and the rest were processed by three state-owned rubber factories such as Zhonghua and three private rubber factories such as Yitang. Because the three state-owned rubber factories such as Zhonghua were originally organs of production and had long been taken over by the local people's government; among the three private rubber factories such as Yitang, one had already closed down, and the other two had been confiscated by the people's government due to enemy property or managers stealing state assets. The joint inspection team only made a general understanding of these six factories and conducted a comprehensive and in-depth inspection of the Tianjin Local State-Owned Rubber Factory and the remaining eighteen private manufacturers. According to the results of the joint inspection, the Tianjin Local State-Owned Rubber Factory made more than 190,000 pairs of defective military rubber shoes, causing a loss of more than 1.8 billion yuan to state property. Since the facts of its illegal dereliction of duty are basically the same as those previously reported in this newspaper, they will not be repeated. The main illegal and criminal facts of the remaining eighteen private manufacturers are as follows:

First, they changed the formula standards without authorization and seriously cut corners. According to the processing agreement for this batch of military rubber shoes, each factory should allocate materials according to the unified formula standards issued by the military in the manufacturing of each part of the rubber shoes in order to ensure that the rubber shoes have a certain quality. However, in order to achieve the despicable purpose of cutting corners, all private manufacturers did not abide by the unified formula standards, which seriously affected the quality of the rubber shoes. Among the various materials used in rubber shoes, raw rubber is the most important raw material, with a large amount and a high price, and it is also a state-controlled material. However, in this inspection, it was found that all private manufacturers had changed the formula standards to steal raw rubber. For example, the outsole is the main part of rubber shoes and requires the most raw rubber. According to the military's regulations, the rubber content should be 40%, but the rubber content of the outsoles made by all factories was less than this number. In addition to the insufficient weight of the raw rubber used and the large amount of moisture contained in it, the most common method they used to steal raw rubber was to use more oil instead of raw rubber. Yufu Rubber Factory used the most oil, and the rubber content of the outsole was only 32.58%, stealing 18.575 catties in every 100 catties of raw rubber used. The same situation occurred in other rubber parts of the rubber shoes. For example, Detai Rubber Factory used more oil in the sponge sole, and Yuhe Rubber Factory used more magnesium carbonate in the rubber slurry, all for the purpose of replacing raw rubber. Especially in the formula for the insole of rubber shoes, the amount of raw rubber they stole was even greater. According to the military's regulations, in the insole formula, 12% raw rubber and 27% recycled rubber should be used, but factories such as Bohua, Dalu, and Yuhe did not use or used very little raw rubber, but used more recycled rubber or fillers.

The purpose of each manufacturer's changing of the formula standards was also to steal and replace other valuable raw materials and to reduce working hours. Some used light calcium carbonate (1,800 yuan per kilogram) to steal some magnesium carbonate (9,000 yuan per kilogram). Some used heavy spar (900 yuan per kilogram) to steal light calcium carbonate (1,800 yuan per kilogram). Some used more calcium carbonate (1,800 yuan per kilogram) and less accelerator (accelerator M 260,000 yuan per kilogram, accelerator D 270,000 yuan per kilogram) and sulfur (14,000 yuan per kilogram), and used more heavy spar in the insole (900 yuan per kilogram) and less recycled rubber (7,600 yuan per kilogram). The methods used to reduce working hours were also various. Some used more vulcanizing agent in the formula in order to reduce vulcanization time; some deliberately increased the temperature of the roller excessively in order to shorten the time for rolling each piece of rubber material.

Second, they used inferior materials to top-grade materials and stole and replaced the military's raw materials. According to the processing agreement, the raw materials supplied by the military should not be exchanged or sold by the contracting factories; the raw materials prepared by the contracting factories themselves must meet the specifications and brands designated by the military, and inferior materials must not be used to top-grade materials. However, all manufacturers violated this agreement. Feilong, Detai, Lixing, Dongchang, and other twelve factories used inferior spindle oil and second yellow oil to replace the cotton seed oil designated by the military. Synthetic, Dalu, Yuhe, Guoguang, and other nine factories used inferior benzene oil or inferior gasoline to steal and replace the military's good benzene oil and good gasoline. The zinc oxide, lithopone, light calcium carbonate, baking soda, accelerator, sulfur, etc. used by factories such as Synthetic, Dalu, and Detai were all different from those designated by the military, and some of them were long-term stocks that had been damp and deteriorated. Even worse, some private manufacturers also used raw materials and waste materials that had expired. The ammonium carbonate used by Dongchang Rubber Factory had already expired. Yufu, Synthetic, Sanheyi, Wuhe, and other factories mixed vulcanized waste rubber when rolling rubber. Zhenhai Rubber Factory mixed waste sponge scraps when rolling sponge rubber. Da Zhonghua, Zhonglian, Wuhe, and other manufacturers mixed cloth corner rubber and broken cloth head rubber when rolling the toe cap and heel help of rubber shoes. Yuhe Rubber Factory even mixed whole pieces of waste sponge soles after repairing them to pass off as good soles.

There were also many cases of stealing and replacing the military's raw rubber and other raw materials. The most common method was to use inferior rubber to steal and replace the military's good raw rubber. Some stole as much as more than 1,700 kilograms. Some used scattered scraps of cloth to make shoe eye pads in order to steal and replace the military's whole cloth.

Third, they secretly changed specifications and made shoddy products. The processing agreement stipulates the size, thickness, and dimensions of each part of the rubber shoes, but many private manufacturers reduced the size of the templates or reduced the thickness in order to steal raw materials. For example, Meng Yitang, the director of Feilong Rubber Factory, asked workers to reduce the size of the shoe upper template three times, stealing a total of 2,298 yards of cloth. The outsole of the rubber shoes made by Dongchang Rubber Factory was particularly thin, 21% thinner than the original specified thickness. The welting of the first and second batches of rubber shoes processed by Tongyi Rubber Factory was 6.7 mm smaller than the original specification, and the third batch processed was also 3 mm smaller, stealing a total of more than 1,900 catties of mixed rubber.

The most common method used by private manufacturers to reduce working hours was to shorten the rubber rolling time and vulcanization time. Dafu, Yuhe, and other eight factories reduced the rolling time of each rubber material by 5 to 10 minutes. The method was to excessively increase the temperature of the roller, resulting in uneven rolling of the rubber material and sometimes even over-rolling, making the shoes prone to cracking. Synthetic, Yufu, Dongchang, Lixing, and other factories added more rubber shoes to the vulcanization tank in order to pursue quantity, resulting in the rubber shoes near the steam pipe being heated more and over-vulcanized, while those far away were not easily heated and under-vulcanized. Dafu and Zhenhai factories wiped sulfur water on the under-vulcanized rubber shoes or smoked them with sulfur in order to deceive the military, making them still appear to be moderately vulcanized.

Fourth, when signing processing agreements with the military, all private manufacturers falsely reported costs. Thirteen of them alone over-reported more than 1.2 billion yuan. After the processing task was completed, each factory also concealed and failed to report the remaining raw materials and had illegal activities such as evading taxes.

Due to the above-mentioned despicable and bad means adopted by private manufacturers in the processing and manufacturing of this batch of military rubber shoes in order to pursue illegal profits, a large part of the finished products they produced turned yellow, hardened, produced white frost, produced white wax, and the sponge soles became sticky, lacked elasticity, and the bottom cloth came off within less than half a year. About one-half of the finished products were completely unusable or not durable, affecting the military supply to the front lines of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea and causing significant losses to state property.

After finding the above-mentioned illegal and criminal activities, the joint inspection team invited personnel with specialized knowledge of the rubber industry to conduct research and appraisal of the equipment of each private factory. The results confirmed that the occurrence of rubber shoe deterioration was completely unrelated to the equipment conditions of each factory, that is to say, it was not caused by objective reasons, but entirely by stealing and changing formula standards, stealing and replacing military raw materials, and making shoddy products.

    最高人民检察署等联合彻查胶鞋变质事件
    查出天津十八家私营橡胶厂严重违法罪行
    今年一月十四日本报发表了天津地方国营橡胶厂和部分私营厂商在为志愿军加工制造军用胶鞋中偷工减料的违法事件后，中央人民政府最高人民检察署立即协同中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会、中央轻工业部、华北行政委员会人民监察委员会和政法委员会、华北军区后勤军需生产部、天津市人民检察署及天津市市、区有关党政机关和工会等组成联合检查组，从二月十三日到三月十八日，对这一违法犯罪事件作了全面的检查。联合检查组在检查过程中，除进一步证实了天津地方国营橡胶厂有关干部的违法失职行为外，还查出私营橡胶厂商在这次加工订货中都有偷工减料、盗窃国家资财的严重违法犯罪行为。根据联合检查组统计，十八家私营橡胶厂厂商用虚报成本、偷工减料和盗换原料等非法手段，共盗窃国家财产三十二亿五千多万元，并因偷工减料和粗制滥造等恶劣行为，使得他们加工制造的军用胶鞋发生变质现象，约有百分之五十的胶鞋不能穿用和不耐穿用，使国家损失五十二亿六千多万元。最高人民检察署已指示天津市人民检察署，将这一案件向天津市人民法院提起公诉，要求依法惩处违法失职的干部和犯有严重“五毒”罪行的奸商。
    这批军用胶鞋的加工制造，是在一九五一年十一月到一九五二年七月，正值“三反”、“五反”运动积极进行的期间。在全部加工的军用胶鞋中，私营裕蚨、震海、大陆、国光等十八家私营橡胶厂的加工数量占百分之六十一点七，天津地方国营橡胶厂的加工数量占百分之二十一点多，其余为国营的中华等三家和私营的义堂等三家橡胶厂所加工。因国营的中华等三家原系机关生产，早为地方人民政府接收；私营的义堂等三家中，有一家早已歇业，另两家因系敌产或因经理人盗窃国家资财已为人民政府没收，联合检查组对这六家只作了一般的了解，对天津地方国营橡胶厂和其余十八家私营厂商则进行了全面深入的检查。根据联合检查的结果，天津地方国营橡胶厂共做坏军用胶鞋十九万多双，给国家财产造成的损失为十八亿多万元，因其违法失职的事实与本报前已报道的基本相同，不再重复，其余十八家私营厂商的主要违法犯罪事实如下：
    第一，擅自更改配方标准，严重地偷工减料。根据这批军用胶鞋的加工协议，各厂在制造胶鞋的各部分时，均应按照军方发给的统一配方标准配料，才能保证胶鞋具有一定的质量。但各私营厂商为了达到偷工减料的卑鄙目的，均未遵守统一的配方标准，因而严重影响了胶鞋的质量。在胶鞋的各种用料中，生胶是最主要的原料，用量较多，价钱较贵，且为国家统制物资。但在这次检查中发现，各私营厂商都曾更改配方标准以盗窃生胶。如大底是胶鞋的主要部分，需用生胶最多，按军方的规定，含胶量应为百分之四十，而各厂所制大底的含胶量均不足此数。他们盗窃生胶的办法，除所用生胶的斤两不足和所含水分较大等外，最普遍的是多用油类代替生胶。裕蚨橡胶厂用的油类最多，大底的含胶量仅有百分之三十二点五八，在每百斤生胶用量内盗窃了十八点五七五斤。在胶鞋的其他用胶部分中，也有同样的情况，如德泰橡胶厂在海绵底中多用油类，裕合橡胶厂在胶浆子中多用碳酸镁，目的都是为了替换生胶。特别是在胶鞋中底的配方中，他们偷盗生胶的数量更大。按军方的规定，在中底配方中，应用生胶百分之十二，再生胶百分之二十七，但博华、大陆、裕合等厂都丝毫未用或少用生胶，而是多用再生胶或填充剂。
    各厂商更改配方标准的目的，还在于盗换其他贵重的原料，并偷减工时。有的用轻碳酸钙（每公斤一千八百元），偷换出部分碳酸镁（每公斤九千元）有的用重炭石（每公斤九百元）偷换轻碳酸钙（每公斤一千八百元）。有的多用碳酸钙（每公斤一千八百元），少用促进剂（促进剂M每公斤二十六万元，促进剂D每公斤二十七万元）和硫磺
  （每公斤一万四千元），并在中底内多用重炭石
  （每公斤九百元），少用再生胶（每公斤七千六百元）。在偷减工时上所用的办法也是多种多样的，有的为了减少硫化时间，在配方中多用硫化剂；有的为了缩短轧制每件胶料的时间，故意过高地增加滚筒的温度。
    第二，以次料顶好料，盗换军方的原料。按加工协议书规定，军方所供给的原料，承制厂不得掉换变卖；由承制厂自备的原料，必须符合军方指定的规格牌号，不得以次料顶好料。但各厂商无不违反此项协议。飞龙、德泰、利兴，东昌等十二家是以次锭子油、二黄油代替军方指定的棉子油，合成、大陆、裕合、国光等九家是以次苯油或次汽油盗换军方的好苯油和好汽油，合成、大陆、德泰等厂所用的氧化锌、立德粉、轻碳酸钙、小苏打、促进剂、硫磺等，都和军方指定的不同，其中还有一些是受潮变质的多年存货。更为恶劣的是，有些私营厂商还用已失时效的原料和废料。东昌橡胶厂所用的碳酸铵就是已失效的，裕蚨、合成、三合义、五和等厂在轧胶时，掺用已硫化过的废胶，震海橡胶厂在轧海绵胶时掺用废海绵末，大中华、中联、五和等厂商轧胶鞋的包头助跟时掺用布角胶和碎布头胶，裕合橡胶厂甚至把整块的废海绵底修补后混充好底。
    盗换军方的生胶和其他原料的也不少。最普遍的是用次胶偷换军方的好生胶，有的偷换的数量多达一千七百多公斤。有的是用零星碎布裁制鞋眼垫布，以盗换军方的整布。
    第三，偷改规格，粗制滥造。在加工协议书中，对胶鞋各部位的尺度大小厚薄都有规定，但许多私营厂商为了盗窃原料，都把各部位的样板缩小或将厚度减薄。如飞龙橡胶厂厂长孟义堂曾三次叫工人把鞋帮的样板改小了，共偷布二千二百九十八码。东昌橡胶厂所做胶鞋的大底特别薄，比原规定的厚度薄百分之二十一。统一橡胶厂所加工的第一和第二批胶鞋的围条，比原规定的小六点七公厘，第三批加工的也小三公厘，共偷混合胶一千九百多斤。
    各私营厂商在偷减工时上，最普遍的是缩短轧胶时间和硫化时间，大福、裕合等八家把每个胶料的轧制时间减少五分至十分钟，办法是过高地增加滚筒温度，结果是胶料轧得不匀，有时还轧熟了，因而鞋子容易开胶。合成、裕蚨、东昌、利兴等厂为了追求数量，在硫化罐内多加胶鞋，因而靠近蒸汽管的胶鞋受热较多而硫化过度，离得远的不易受热而硫化不足。大福、震海两厂为了欺骗军方，在硫化不足的胶鞋上擦上硫磺水，或用硫磺熏，使其仍呈硫化适度的颜色。
    第四，各私营厂商在与军方签订加工协议书时，都曾虚报成本，仅其中的十三家就多报十二亿多万元。在加工任务完成后，各厂还隐瞒不报剩余原料，并有偷漏税款等不法行为。
    由于各私营厂商在加工制造这批军用胶鞋中，为了追逐非法利润，采取了上述的卑鄙恶劣手段，他们所制出的成品在不到半年的时间内，就有很大一部分发生了大底和围条等变黄、发硬、冒白霜、冒白蜡，以及海绵底发黏、弹力不足、底布脱开等变质现象，约有二分之一的成品根本不能穿用或不耐穿用，影响了抗美援朝前线的军需供应，并给国家财产造成了重大损失。
    联合检查组在查出上述违法犯罪行为后，曾延请对橡胶工业有专门知识的人员，对各该私营工厂的设备作了研究鉴定，结果证实胶鞋变质现象的发生，完全与各厂的设备条件无关，也就是说不是客观原因所造成的，而完全是由于偷改配方标准、盗换军方原料以及粗制滥造等所造成的。
