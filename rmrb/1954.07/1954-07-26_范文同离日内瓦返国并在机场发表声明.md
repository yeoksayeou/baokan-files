Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, July 25th: Vietnam Democratic Republic’s Deputy Prime Minister and Acting Foreign Minister Phạm Văn Đồng and his delegation passed through Berlin on July 25th en route home from Geneva.

It is reported that Phạm Văn Đồng issued the following statement at the airport before departing Geneva: “We are about to return home... All the agreements have been signed, which is very good. However, this is not everything; these agreements must be fulfilled and faithfully implemented.

The extremely complex political and military situation requires us to return home, because we still have much to do.”

Phạm Văn Đồng told a French Press Agency reporter: “I hope you will tell France and French public opinion that, in signing the agreements and implementing them, the most important thing is the mutual trust between the people of our two countries—you French and us citizens of the Vietnam Democratic Republic. If we do well in this regard, if we act in an atmosphere of trust, then everything will go smoothly. Establishing good relations between our two countries is the foundation of our policy.”

    范文同离日内瓦返国并在机场发表声明
    【新华社二十五日讯】据塔斯社柏林二十五日讯：越南民主共和国副总理兼代理外交部长范文同一行自日内瓦返国途中于二十五日路过柏林。
    据悉，范文同从日内瓦动身前在机场发表了下列声明：“我们就要回国了……各项协定都已签字，这是很好的。但是，这并不是一切，必须履行并忠实地履行这些协定。
    极其复杂的政治和军事形势要求我们回国去，因为我们还有许多事情要做。”
    范文同对法新社记者说：“我希望你对法国和法国舆论说，在签订协定以及实现协定方面，最重要的是我们两国人民——你们法国人和我们越南民主共和国的公民之间的互相信任。如果我们在这一点上做得好，如果我们是在一种信任的气氛中行事，那么，一切事情都会顺利。建立我们两国间的良好的关系，这是我们政策的基础。”
