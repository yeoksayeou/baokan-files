The Geneva Conference, in which our country participated as one of the world's major powers, overcame the numerous obstacles of the warmongering elements of the United States ruling group and reached an agreement on the Indochina armistice and restoration of peace on July 21, 1954. The conclusion of this agreement not only ended the eight-year Indochina War, realizing the peaceful aspirations of the people of Indochina, the people of France, and peace-loving people all over the world, but will also promote the further easing of tensions in Asia and the world. This is a historically significant and great victory for the people of the world.

We warmly celebrate this great victory and solemnly declare to the people of the world that we will stand with the people of China and the people of the world to strive for the thorough implementation of all agreements and continue to work tirelessly to safeguard peace in Asia and the world. We firmly believe that as long as the people of the world work together and the countries concerned have peaceful sincerity, any international dispute can be resolved through negotiation.

We especially call on the people of the whole country to fight for the liberation of Taiwan from the occupation of the United States' military force and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. Taiwan has been our country's territory since ancient times, and the people of Taiwan are our compatriots. The people of our country must fight to the end to liberate Taiwan, and we will never stop until we reach our goal!

    首都各界庆祝印度支那停战大会的决议
    我国以世界大国之一的身分参加的日内瓦会议，克服了美国好战份子统治集团的重重阻挠，于一九五四年七月二十一日就印度支那停战和恢复和平问题达成了协议。这一协议的达成，不仅结束了八年的印度支那战争，实现了印度支那人民、法国人民和全世界爱好和平人民的和平愿望，而且也将促进亚洲以及全世界紧张局势的进一步缓和。这是一次带有历史意义的全世界人民的伟大胜利。
    我们热烈庆祝这一伟大的胜利，并郑重地向全世界人民宣告，我们将与全中国人民及全世界人民在一起，为保证全部协议的彻底实现而奋斗，并继续为维护亚洲与世界的和平而努力不懈。我们坚信，只要全世界人民一致努力，有关国家具有和平诚意，任何国际争端是可以通过协商获致解决的。
    我们特别号召全国人民，为从美国武力与蒋介石匪帮占领之下解放台湾而奋斗。台湾自古以来是我国的领土，台湾人民是我们的同胞，我全国人民一定要为解放台湾奋斗到底，不达目的，决不休止！
