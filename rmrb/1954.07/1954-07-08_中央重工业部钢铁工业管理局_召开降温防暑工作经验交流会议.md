    The Central Heavy Industry Department's Steel Industry Administration
    Convened a Conference to Exchange Experiences in Cooling and Heatstroke Prevention
    Xinhua News Agency: In late June, the Steel Industry Administration of the Central People's Government's Ministry of Heavy Industry convened a conference at the state-owned Daye Steel Plant to exchange experiences in cooling and heatstroke prevention. Participating in this conference were safety workers and engineering technicians from state-owned steel companies and steel factories in North China, East China, Central South China, and Southwest China. Cadres from the labor departments, health agencies, and medical colleges of the Central South region also attended the meeting as observers.

    According to the information provided at this conference, in recent years, China's steel factories have achieved many successes and accumulated experience in summer cooling and heatstroke prevention work, including the mechanization of production processes, the installation of natural ventilation, mechanical ventilation, and insulation facilities, and the use of protective equipment, cooling drinks, and high-temperature foods. Many steelmaking workshops, rolling workshops, and forging workshops have installed new air showers to blow cool air towards workers or workplaces. Some factories have also set up water curtain rest areas, allowing workers operating in high temperatures to have cool resting places during working hours. After research, the conference believed that the factories that have achieved greater success in summer heatstroke prevention work are mainly because they closely integrated heatstroke prevention work with the current technical innovation movement. For example, in terms of the mechanization of the production process, everyone agreed that the "reverse upright surrounding disc" successfully trial-produced by Daye Steel Plant in the technical innovation movement and the "automatic steel turning machine" successfully trial-produced by Tianjin Steel Plant are both of great value for widespread promotion in the rolling sector. Due to the installation of the "reverse upright surrounding disc" on the rolling mill of Daye Steel Plant, ten rolling workers in each production shift have been completely freed from high-temperature operations. The conference selected some major experiences to organize attendees to repeatedly study and research. Each unit participating in the conference put forward promotion plans based on their specific circumstances. According to incomplete statistics, more than 30 pieces of experience have been mutually selected for promotion. Among them, six steel factories plan to promote the "reverse upright surrounding disc," and five steel factories plan to promote the "automatic steel turning machine."

    中央重工业部钢铁工业管理局
    召开降温防暑工作经验交流会议
    中央人民政府重工业部钢铁工业管理局六月下旬在国营大冶钢厂召开降温、防暑工作经验交流会议。参加这次会议的有华北、华东、中南、西南地区各国营钢铁公司、钢铁工厂的安全工作人员和工程技术人员。中南区的劳动部门、卫生机关和医科专门学校也都派干部列席了这次会议。
    根据这次会议所提供的情况说明：最近几年，我国钢铁工厂在生产过程的机械化，装置自然通风、机械通风、隔热设施和使用防护用具、清凉饮料、高温食品等夏季降温和防暑工作上，取得了许多成绩和经验。许多炼钢车间、轧钢车间和锻工车间，都设置了新的空气淋浴，向工人或工作场地吹送凉爽的风。有些工厂还设置了水簾休息室，让高温下操作的工人能在工作时间获得凉爽的休息场所。会议经过研究以后，认为凡是在夏季防暑工作中成绩较大的工厂，主要是因为把防暑工作和当前开展的技术革新运动密切相结合。例如在生产过程机械化方面，大家一致认为大冶钢厂在技术革新运动中试制成功的“反立围盘”，天津钢厂试制成功的“自动翻钢机”，在轧钢部门都具有广泛推广的价值。大冶钢厂的轧钢机上由于装置了“反立围盘”，已经使每一个生产班有十个轧钢工完全解脱了高温操作。会议选择了一些主要的经验组织到会人员反复地进行了学习和研究。参加会议的各个单位都根据自己的具体情况提出了推广计划。根据不完全统计：已经被相互选定推广的经验共有三十多件。其中要推广“反立围盘”的有六个钢铁工厂，要推广“自动翻钢机”的有五个钢铁工厂。
