The news of the reached armistice agreement in Indochina is exhilarating. This is a victory for the people of Indochina, who have fought for independence, freedom, democracy, and unification for many years; this is a victory for the French people, who resolutely demanded an end to the Indochina War; this is a victory for peace-loving people all over the world.

The agreement reached on the restoration of peace in Indochina brings peace to the people of the three Indochinese countries and the French people. The people of the three Indochinese countries can now engage in their national construction in a peaceful environment and establish normal and friendly relations with France; French soldiers in Indochina can return home to reunite with their families and live peacefully, eliminating the pain and disaster brought to the French people by the Indochina War; at the same time, it will help to further ease the tense situation in Asia and the world. We warmly support the armistice and restoration of peace agreement in Indochina.

The conclusion of the agreement on the restoration of peace in Indochina once again demonstrates to the world this irrefutable truth: any complex international dispute can be resolved through peaceful consultation as long as both parties have a spirit of reconciliation and the sincerity to reach an agreement; and international disputes must be resolved through the principles of peaceful consultation. The conclusion of the agreement on the restoration of peace in Indochina eloquently proves this point. The conclusion of the agreement on the restoration of peace in Indochina is another victory for peace over war, and another victory for the principles of peaceful negotiation and peaceful coexistence, severely打击ed the warmongering group of Wall Street in the United States who are obsessed with the "policy of strength".

The agreement on the restoration of peace in Indochina was reached as a result of the important efforts made by the delegations of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the French government with sincerity for reconciliation, the active assistance of the Soviet, Chinese, and British delegations, especially the major efforts made by the Soviet, Chinese, and Vietnamese Democratic Republic delegations based on their consistent peaceful diplomatic policies dedicated to maintaining and consolidating peace in Asia and the world.

Our delegation to the Geneva Conference, adhering to the strong will of our 600 million people to strive for peace in Asia and the world, attended the conference for the first time as a major power and made outstanding efforts to reach an agreement on the restoration of peace in Indochina, greatly enhancing our country's international status and international prestige. We feel satisfied and honored.

The conclusion of the agreement on the restoration of peace in Indochina is a step forward in consolidating peace and security in Asia and easing international tensions. However, the thorough implementation of the agreement on the restoration of peace in Indochina will not be without obstacles. The US delegation actively employed destructive means at the Geneva Conference to obstruct the progress of the conference. Due to the destructive activities of the US delegation, the Geneva Conference failed to reach an agreement on the peaceful unification of Korea.

Now, US imperialism is still occupying a part of our sacred territory—Taiwan, and colluding with Chiang Kai-shek, the mortal enemy of the Chinese people entrenched in Taiwan, to actively carry out criminal activities to attack the Chinese mainland and undermine peace in Asia. During the Geneva Conference, the criminal activities of US imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek have intensified, more brazenly robbing merchant ships of various countries navigating the Taiwan Strait, undermining our economic and cultural exchanges with various countries; sending special agents to sneak into the Chinese mainland, and sending US-made bandit planes and bandit ships to harass our coastal areas; US warmongers Van Fleet and others traveled back and forth between Japan, South Korea, and the Philippines, actively organizing Southeast Asian aggressive military blocs, attempting to invade China and Asia, making China once again a colony exploited and enslaved by US imperialism, and suppressing the national liberation movements in various Asian countries.

The Chinese people will never tolerate the criminal activities of US imperialism undermining China's territorial sovereignty. Taiwan has been an inalienable part of China since ancient times. The Chinese people will liberate Taiwan, and we will never stop until we achieve our goal!

    台湾民主自治同盟总部发言人的谈话
    印度支那停战协议达成的消息传来，令人欢欣鼓舞。这是为谋求独立、自由、民主和统一而奋斗多年的印度支那人民的胜利；这是坚决要求停止印度支那战争的法国人民的胜利；这是全世界爱好和平人民的胜利。
    恢复印度支那和平问题达成协议，给印度支那三国人民及法国人民带来和平。印度支那三国人民从此可以在和平的环境下从事他们的国家建设，并与法国建立正常友好的关系；在印度支那的法国士兵可以回去和其家庭团聚过和平的生活，消除因进行印度支那战争而给法国人民带来的痛苦与灾难；同时有助于进一步缓和亚洲和世界的紧张局势。我们热烈拥护印度支那停战和恢复和平的协议。
    恢复印度支那和平的协议的达成，再一次地向全世界昭示这个颠扑不破的真理：任何复杂的国际争端只要双方都具有和解的精神与达成协议的诚意，是可以用和平协商的方法求得解决的；而且也必须以和平协商的原则才能解决国际争端。恢复印度支那和平的协议的达成雄辩地证明了这个问题。恢复印度支那和平的协议的达成，是和平又一次战胜了战争，和平协商与和平共处的原则的又一次胜利，严重地打击了执迷于“实力政策”的美国华尔街好战集团。
    恢复印度支那和平的问题能够达成协议，是越南民主共和国和法国政府代表团以和解的诚意作了重要努力，苏联、中国和英国代表团作了积极协助，特别是苏联、中国和越南民主共和国代表团本着一贯致力于维护与巩固亚洲与世界和平的和平外交政策，作了重大努力的结果。
    出席日内瓦会议的我国代表团，秉承了我国六亿人民为争取亚洲及世界和平的坚强意志，第一次以大国的身份出席会议，对达成恢复印度支那和平的协议作出了卓越的努力，大大提高了我国的国际地位与国际声望，我们感到满意与光荣。
    恢复印度支那和平协议的达成，对巩固亚洲和平与安全向前推进了一步，进而缓和国际紧张形势，但彻底地贯彻恢复印度支那和平的协议，并不是不会遇到阻碍的。美国代表团在日内瓦会议上积极施展破坏手段，阻挠会议的进展。由于美国代表团的破坏活动，日内瓦会议对和平统一朝鲜问题没有达成协议。
    现在美帝国主义还侵占着我国的神圣领土的一部分——台湾，和盘踞在台湾的中国人民死敌蒋介石互相勾结，积极进行进攻中国大陆、破坏亚洲和平的罪恶活动。在日内瓦会议期间，美帝国主义和蒋介石的罪恶活动更是变本加厉，更猖狂地抢劫航行于台湾海峡的各国商船，破坏我国与各国的经济、文化交流；派遣特务潜入中国大陆，派遣美制匪机、匪舰骚扰我国沿海地区；美国好战分子范佛里特等奔走往返于日本、南朝鲜、菲律宾，积极组织东南亚侵略军事集团，企图侵略中国和亚洲，使中国重新沦为美帝国主义剥削奴役的殖民地，并镇压亚洲各国的民族解放运动。
    中国人民绝不能容忍美帝国主义破坏中国领土主权的罪恶活动，台湾自古就是中国不可分割的领土的一部分，中国人民一定解放台湾，不达到目的决不罢休！
