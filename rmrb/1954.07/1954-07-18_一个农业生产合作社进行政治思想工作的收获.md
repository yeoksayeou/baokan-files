    Gains from Political Ideological Work in an Agricultural Producers' Cooperative
    Zhang Diancai, Member of the Xinglong Village Branch of the CCP in Nehe County, Director of the Xinmin Agricultural Producers' Cooperative

                  Since the establishment of our Xinmin Agricultural Producers' Cooperative, we have consistently paid attention to conducting political ideological education work among our members, which has enabled our cooperative to continuously consolidate and develop.
    Conducting political ideological education for cooperative members is not an easy task. As a farmer myself, I can attest to this. A district committee member said: Chairman Mao said, "The serious problem is the education of the peasants," and I feel that this statement is absolutely correct. When educating peasants, one must be enthusiastic, patient, and repeatedly persuade and explain, and only then will they believe what you say. Let me illustrate with a few examples. After the grain distribution in the first autumn, cooperative member Lao Shu demanded to withdraw from the cooperative. The Party branch assigned me to talk to Lao Shu. After several conversations, Lao Shu still didn't reveal what was on his mind. Lao Shu kept saying that he was too old and couldn't work anymore, insisting on withdrawing from the cooperative. At this time, the cooperative members started to discuss: "Lao Shu is dead set on leaving, whoever can educate him back is truly capable." At the time, I thought: Lao Shu cannot be dead set on leaving, there must be a knot in his heart that hasn't been untied, so I must continue to patiently educate him. Later, I had several more conversations with Lao Shu, but still didn't reach his heart. Just then, Lao Shu's son, Shu Zunqin, returned from school for vacation, so I seized this opportunity and assigned the task of educating Lao Shu to him. After all, father and son are close, and Lao Shu revealed what was on his mind. It turned out that Lao Shu saw that the cooperative had harvested a lot of grain in the first year, but he didn't receive much, and thought that it was better to set up a small stall on the street. Shu Zunqin patiently explained to his father. Lao Shu then remembered his past impoverished days, and thought about how his life had been getting better and better since joining the agricultural producers' cooperative, and where would he go if he left this good path now? Lao Shu decided not to withdraw from the cooperative. Now Lao Shu can work in the cooperative and puts more effort into his work than some young people. Another incident: When spring ploughing and sowing began last year, cooperative member Jiang Hailin withdrew from the cooperative and went to Laha Town with his wife to do business, which angered the cooperative members who said: "We will never allow him to return to the cooperative." Some cooperative members also thought that Lao Jiang was right, saying "Doing business is better than farming." We criticized both of these erroneous views, explaining that discrimination was wrong, but envy was also wrong, and we should educate and strive for Jiang Hailin to return to the cooperative. During the wheat harvest, the cooperative received a letter from Jiang Hailin from Laha Town, saying that his business there had failed and he had lost over 1.2 million yuan, requesting the agricultural producers' cooperative to send a vehicle to pick him up. The cooperative members' anger hadn't subsided, and they all advocated ignoring him. After the Party branch committee met and discussed, it was decided that Jiang Hailin must be brought back by vehicle, and at the same time, this matter should be used to educate the cooperative members about unity and friendship. After the meeting, we propagated to the cooperative members: The purpose of the Communist Party is to guide all the peasants onto the path of prosperity, and to bring back those who have taken the wrong path is our glorious task. Jiang Hailin's withdrawal from the cooperative was wrong, but now that he can turn back, he is still a good cooperative member. After propaganda, the cooperative members agreed, hitched up a large cart, and brought Jiang Hailin back. Jiang Hailin was very moved, reviewed his mistakes to everyone, and expressed his determination to correct them. He said:
  "I have tasted the taste of taking the capitalist road, and now I know that without Chairman Mao's path, that road is impassable!"
    We often pay attention to using real people and real events in the cooperative to conduct collectivist education among the cooperative members. This spring, when delivering manure to the fields, some cooperative members were very selfish and unwilling to put good manure on the cooperative's land, planning to put it on their own private plots. However, cooperative member Fu Hailin put all the more than forty cartloads of good manure he had accumulated on the cooperative's land. We used Fu Hailin's example to educate the cooperative members, organized them to hold discussions, and enlightened their collectivist thinking. Many cooperative members put the good manure they had accumulated on the cooperative's land, completing the cooperative's plan to increase base fertilizer application. Once, during a strong wind, production team leader Wang Guoxiang was pressing down his own firewood pile when he looked up and saw that the sod on the roof of the cooperative's warehouse was being blown away by the wind. He immediately dropped his firewood pile, climbed onto the warehouse, used his body to press down on the sod that was being blown away by the wind, and called for people to rescue it, so that the cooperative's property was not damaged. When Wang Guoxiang came down from the warehouse, much of his own firewood had been blown away by the wind, but he didn't care and said: "The firewood can be gathered up again if it's blown away, but if the roof of the cooperative is blown away by the wind, the loss would be great." That evening, we organized a cooperative members' symposium to discuss Wang Guoxiang's act of loving the cooperative. This discussion greatly educated the cooperative members and further strengthened their thinking of loving the cooperative. In order to ensure that everyone is constantly educated in collectivism, we regularly commend the exemplary deeds of cooperative members on the cooperative's blackboard bulletin, and at the same time criticize individual cooperative members who violate collective interests.
    We also regularly conduct patriotism and worker-peasant alliance education among the cooperative members. Since the establishment of the cooperative, the state's assistance to our agricultural producers' cooperative has been great. The state has lent us over 50 million yuan and four sets of new-style horse-drawn farm implements. Since last year, our agricultural producers' cooperative has also been using tractors. We use these facts to educate the cooperative members and organize them to discuss them, so that they realize that the interests of the cooperative members, the interests of the agricultural producers' cooperative, and the interests of the country are inseparable. This year, when I returned from the provincial labor model conference, I also told the cooperative members about visiting the machinery manufacturing factory to see the agricultural machines being made. The cooperative members were overjoyed. They said: "The worker elder brothers make machines for us, so we must work hard to increase production and support them." This year, the cooperative members are planning to sell more than one thousand dan of grain to the state, and also planted twelve *xiang* of sugar beets, so as to provide raw materials for industrial production. They said: "How the Communist Party calls us to do it, we will do it, and what the country needs, we will plant."
    Regularly caring about the lives of cooperative members and helping them overcome difficulties in their daily lives is also an important aspect of the Party's political work. Once, cooperative member Yang Guoan fell ill, so I went to comfort him and borrowed money for him to see a doctor. Later, a strong wind came, and Lao Yang's house was blown down by the wind. Lao Yang was sick in bed and couldn't get up, anxious and helpless. So I mobilized the cooperative members to use the sod from my house to repair Lao Yang's house. Lao Yang was so moved that he shed tears. He felt relieved and his illness improved; soon, he recovered. He often said: "There is no one closer than the cooperative." Once, cooperative member Xu Jinglin's wife couldn't give birth and was in danger. So we used a stretcher to carry her to Tongxi Street, then transferred her by car to Laha Town Hospital. The Laha Hospital performed an operation on the parturient woman and saved her life. Xu Jinglin said gratefully:
  "If I hadn't joined the cooperative, I would have waited to die." The cooperative members also said: "The cooperative, this big family, is even better than our own mother." The female cooperative members especially felt this deeply. They said: "The cooperative saved the life of someone who was about to die." They expressed that they must participate in labor like men and run the cooperative well. During the summer hoeing season, twenty-two women carried large hoes to the fields.
    The Party branch and Communist Party members also pay great attention to promoting democracy within the cooperative and carrying out criticism and self-criticism to consolidate the cooperative. In the year the cooperative was established, due to a lack of experience in leadership, unclear management policies, and excessive expenditure, although the cooperative harvested more grain, the income of the cooperative members did not increase, so the cooperative members had many opinions. At this time, we convened a cooperative members' meeting and conducted a democratic review. The cooperative members made severe criticisms of the cooperative's unplanned financial expenditures, the laxity of various management systems, and especially the extraction of manpower for sideline businesses during the autumn harvest, which affected the autumn harvest. Through this democratic review, the leadership of the cooperative was improved, the ideological awareness of the cooperative members was raised, and the cooperative members' sense of ownership was established. Now, criticism and self-criticism has become the cooperative members' conscious action.

    一个农业生产合作社进行政治思想工作的收获
    中共讷河县兴隆村支部委员  新民农业生产合作社主任  张殿财
                  我们新民农业生产合作社成立以来，就一直注意向社员进行政治思想教育工作，所以我们社能够不断地巩固和发展。
    对社员进行政治思想教育，是一件不容易的事情。我是个农民，就有这种体会。有个区委委员讲：毛主席说“严重的问题是教育农民”，我感到这句话说得太好了。对农民教育就要热情、耐心，反复地说服解释，他们才会相信你的话。拿几件事情来说明吧。头一年秋天分配粮食以后，社员老舒头要求退社。支部指定我和老舒头谈话。谈了几次，老舒头都没说出心里的话来。老舒头光推说岁数大啦，干不动，非退社不可。这时社员们就议论开了：“老舒头死了心啦，谁要能把他教育过来，算是有能耐的。”当时我想：老舒头不会死了心的，一定是心里拧了个疙瘩没解开，还得耐心地教育。以后，我又和老舒头谈了几次话，还是没谈到他心里去。这时正赶上老舒头的儿子舒尊钦从学校放假回来，我就抓住这个机会，把教育老舒头的任务，交给了他。总还是父子亲近，老舒头把心里的话说出来了。原来老舒头看着头一年社里打的粮食挺多，自己却没分多少，心想这还不如往街头摆个小摊。舒尊钦耐心地向他父亲作了解释。老舒头这才想起自己过去的穷苦日子来，又想到自从参加了农业生产合作社，日子就越过越好，现在离开这条好道往那里走呢？老舒头决定不退社了。现在老舒头在社里可能干啦，干起活来比有些青年人还卖力。另一件事情：去年春耕播种的时候，社员姜海林退了社，带着老婆到拉哈镇做买卖去了，气得社员们说：“以后坚决不准他回社。”也有些社员认为老姜作的对，说“作买卖要比种庄稼强。”我们对这两种错误看法都进行了批判，说明歧视是不对的，但是羡慕也是不对的，应当教育争取姜海林回社。麦收时候，社里接到姜海林从拉哈镇捎来的信，说在那里买卖没做好，赔了一百二十多万元，请求农业生产合作社派车去接他回来。社员的气还没消，都主张不理睬他。党支部委员会开会商量后，认为必须用车把姜海林接回来，同时通过这件事情对社员进行团结友爱的教育。会后，我们就向社员宣传：共产党的目的，是把全体农民都引导到生活富裕的道路上来，把走错了路的人再领回来，正是咱们的光荣任务。姜海林出社是不对的，但是现在能够回头，还是个好社员。经过宣传，社员们同意了，就套上大车，把姜海林接回来了。姜海林很受感动，向大家检讨了自己的错误，表示决心改正。他说：
  “我算尝到走资本主义道路的滋味啦，现在知道离了毛主席的道，那条道也走不通啊！”
    我们经常注意用社里的真人实事来对社员进行集体主义教育。今年春天，往地里送粪时，有些社员自私心很严重，不愿意把好粪上到社的地里，打算上在自己的园子地里。但是社员傅海林却把自己积的四十多车好粪，都上到了社的地里。我们就拿傅海林这件事向社员进行教育，组织社员进行座谈，启发了社员的集体主义思想。很多社员把自己积的好粪都上到社的地里来了，完成了社里增施底肥的计划。有一次刮大风，生产组长王国祥正在压自己的柴禾垛，一抬头看见社库房顶上的铺草叫风卷起来了，他马上丢开了自己的柴禾垛，爬上库房，用自己的身子压住了被风卷起来的铺草，并招呼人来抢救，使社的财产没有受到损失。当王国祥从库房上下来的时候，他自己的柴禾已被风刮跑了好多，他毫不在意地说：“柴禾刮跑了再搂，社的房顶叫风卷去，损失可就大啦。”当天晚上，我们就组织了社员座谈会，讨论王国祥的爱社行为。这次讨论对社员教育很大，进一步增强了社员们的爱社思想。为了使大家经常受到集体主义的教育，我们在社里的黑板报上，经常表扬社员们的模范事迹，同时也批评个别违反集体利益的社员。
    我们还经常向社员进行爱国主义和工农联盟的教育。建社以来，国家对我们农业生产合作社的援助可大啦，国家贷给我们五千多万元的款项，四套新式马拉农具。去年起，我们农业生产合作社又使用上了拖拉机。我们就拿这些事实来教育社员，并组织他们讨论，使他们认识到社员的利益、农业生产合作社的利益和国家的利益是分不开的。今年我从省里开劳动模范大会回来，又把参观机械制造厂制造农业机器的事说给社员们听，社员们都乐坏了，他们说：“工人老大哥给咱们造机器，咱们可得好好增加生产支援他们。”今年社员们计划着卖给国家一千多石粮食，还种植了十二垧甜菜，好给工业生产做原料。他们说：“共产党号召咱们怎样干，咱们就怎样干，国家要什么，咱们就种什么。”
    经常地关心社员的生活，帮助他们克服日常生活中的困难，也是党的政治工作的一个重要方面。有一次，社员杨国安生了病，我便去安慰他，并替他借钱治病。后来又赶上刮大风，老杨的房子叫风刮坏了，老杨病在炕上起不来，干着急，没办法。于是我又动员社员们用我家的铺房草替老杨把房子修理好了。老杨感动得落了泪，他心里一痛快，病就轻了；不久，就好了。他常说：“再亲没有比社亲的了。”还有一次，社员徐景林的老婆生孩子生不下来，眼看人不行了。我们就用担架把她抬到通西街，又转乘汽车，送到拉哈镇医院里去。拉哈医院给产妇动了手术，保全了生命。徐景林感动地说：
  “要不参加社，非等着死不可。”社员们也都说：“社这个大家庭，比自己的妈都强。”特别是女社员体会更深。她们说：“快死的人，社给救活了。”她们表示一定要和男人一样参加劳动，把社办好。夏锄时，就有二十二名妇女都扛着大锄下了地。
    党支部和共产党员还非常注意在社内发扬民主，开展批评和自我批评来巩固社。建社那年，由于领导上没有经验，经营方针不明确，经费开支太大，社里虽然多打了粮食，社员的收入却并没有增加，因此社员的意见很多。这时我们就召开社员大会，进行了民主检查。对社里财务开支没计划，各项管理制度不严密，尤其在秋收时抽出人马搞副业，影响了秋收等等错误，社员们都提出了严厉的批评。通过这次民主检查，改进了社的领导，提高了社员的思想觉悟，树立了社员的主人翁思想。现在，批评和自我批评已成了社员们的自觉行动。
