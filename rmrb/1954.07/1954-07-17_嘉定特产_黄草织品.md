Jiading Specialty - Yellow Grass Woven Products

The output of yellow grass woven products, a specialty of Xuhang District, Jiading County, Jiangsu Province, has increased compared to previous years, the quality has also improved, and the styles are more exquisite and beautiful this year. The sales volume in the first half of this year has exceeded the total sales volume of last year.

The yellow grass woven products produced in Xuhang District include more than 200 styles of slippers, handbags, tea cup covers, pot mats, sports hats, and toys. These products are sold in many provinces and cities in East China, North China, and Northeast China, and some are also exported.

Yellow grass weaving is the main sideline of farmers in Xuhang District and has a history of more than 100 years. Before liberation, most of the products were purchased at low prices by foreign merchants in Shanghai for export. At that time, farmers could only exchange five pairs of slippers for one catty of rice. After liberation, state-owned commercial departments and supply and marketing cooperatives correctly implemented price policies. Last year, the income of farmers in Xuhang District from weaving yellow grass products was equivalent to 55% of the district's agricultural income. Now there are more than 2,700 households participating in this sideline production. Nearly half of them have formed grass weaving production cooperatives. Those who are not organized also receive technical guidance from production cooperatives through processing and purchasing to improve product quality. The defective rate of yellow grass woven products has now been reduced from the original 30% to below 10%, and more than ten new varieties and styles have been created.

This year, grass weaving production cooperatives have successively signed supply contracts with state-owned companies and consumer cooperatives in Shanghai, Lushun-Dalian, Suzhou and other places to carry out production in a planned manner. The planned output of handbags and slippers alone is about three times the total output of the entire district last year. (Xinhua News Agency)

    嘉定特产——黄草织品
    江苏省嘉定县徐行区特产的黄草织品今年的出品数量已比往年增加，质量也提高了，式样更加精致美观。今年上半年的销售量已超过去年全年的销售总量。
    徐行区出产的黄草织品有拖鞋、手提包、茶杯套、盆垫、运动帽和玩具等二百多种式样。这些产品除销售华东、华北、东北许多省、市外，还有部分输出。
    黄草织品是徐行区农民的主要副业，已有一百多年的历史。解放以前的多数产品是由上海的外国商人低价收购出口的。那时农民编五双拖鞋才能换一斤大米。解放后国营商业部门和供销合作社正确执行价格政策，去年徐行区农民编织黄草织品的收入相当于全区农业收入百分之五十五。现在参加这一副业生产的农民已有二千七百多户。其中近半数已组成草织品生产合作社。没有组织起来的也由生产合作社通过加工、收购等方式进行技术指导提高产品质量。黄草织品的副品率现在已由原来的百分之三十降低为百分之十以下；并创造了十多种新品种和新式样。
    今年草织品生产合作社先后和上海、旅大、苏州等地国营公司和消费合作社订立供应合同，有计划地进行生产，单是手提包和拖鞋两项的计划产量即等于去年全区生产总数三倍左右。（新华社）
