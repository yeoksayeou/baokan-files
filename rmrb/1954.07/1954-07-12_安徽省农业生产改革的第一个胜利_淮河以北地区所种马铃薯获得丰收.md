The first victory in the agricultural production reform in the area north of the Huai River in Anhui Province has been achieved: a bumper harvest of over 150,000 mu of potatoes. The harvested potatoes generally yield around 1,000 jin per mu, with some reaching over 3,000 jin, and the estimated total output is 150 million jin. Compared with growing sorghum for one season in the past (with an average yield of 150 jin per mu), the actual income from growing potatoes is more than twice that of growing sorghum.

The potato harvest in the area north of the Huai River in Anhui Province has strengthened the confidence of local farmers in carrying out agricultural production reform. Farmers are now engaged in potato seed selection. At the same time, local supply and marketing cooperatives have begun purchasing potatoes to supply to urban residents for consumption.

    安徽省农业生产改革的第一个胜利
    淮河以北地区所种马铃薯获得丰收
    安徽省淮河以北地区农业生产改革已取得第一个胜利，这就是十五万多亩马铃薯的丰收。已收获的马铃薯，一般每亩产量都在一千斤上下，高的达到三千斤以上，预计总产量可达一亿五千万斤。这和过去一年种一季高粱（平均每亩产一百五十斤）相比，种马铃薯的实际收益比种高粱多了两倍。
    安徽省淮河以北地区马铃薯的丰收，巩固了当地农民进行农业生产改革的信心。现在农民们正进行马铃薯的选种工作。同时，当地供销合作社已开始收购马铃薯，供应城市人民食用。（新华社）
