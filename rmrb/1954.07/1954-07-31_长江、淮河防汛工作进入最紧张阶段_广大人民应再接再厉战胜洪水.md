Yangtze and Huai River Flood Prevention Work Enters Most Critical Stage
The Broad Masses Should Make Continued Efforts to Conquer the Floods

[Report from this newspaper] This year's flood season, due to special meteorological conditions, has seen the rain zone concentrated over a large area of the Yangtze River basin, with an exceptionally long rainy season and extremely heavy rainfall. The Yangtze River water level has exceeded that of 1931 and 1949, creating the largest flood in nearly a century. For example, the highest water level at Chenglingji in 1931 was 33.19 meters, in 1949 it was 33.29 meters, and this year it reached 34.08 meters. At Jiujiang, the highest water level in 1931 was 20.53 meters, in 1949 it was 20.92 meters, and this year it reached 22.08 meters. At Nanjing, the highest water level in 1931 was 9.29 meters, and this year it reached 9.63 meters. At Wuhan Customs, the highest water level in 1931 was 28.28 meters, but Wuhan City was breached and flooded at 26.94 meters. This year, the water level has been above 27 meters since July 2nd, reaching 28.31 meters on July 18th, and 28.82 meters on July 30th, remaining above the 1931 breach level for nearly a month, and exceeding the historical high water level for over ten days. The Huai River basin has also experienced heavy rainfall since the beginning of July, with heavy rainfall and a long rainy season, also exceeding the major floods of 1950 and 1931. For example, the highest historical water level at Zhengyangguan is 24.77 meters, but on July 26th this year, the water level rose to 26.41 meters. Therefore, the current flood prevention work on the Yangtze and Huai Rivers has entered the most critical stage.

This year’s Yangtze River flood has been exacerbated by rising water levels in the Poyang Lake and Dongting Lake systems in May and June. The Poyang Lake water level exceeded the historical high on June 16th, the Anqing water level exceeded the historical high on June 30th, and the Yueyang water level in Dongting Lake also exceeded the historical high on July 2nd. In May and June, the Hankou water level was the highest for the same period in ninety years. Because the Yangtze River water level was very high, the Hankou water level rose sharply after heavy rains in early July. To protect the safety of Wuhan City, the Wuhan Flood Prevention Headquarters has made long-term defense arrangements based on weather and water level forecasts. Under the leadership of the Flood Prevention Headquarters, the people of Wuhan are engaged in a heroic and tenacious struggle. On the one hand, a comprehensive inspection and reinforcement of the more than 100-kilometer-long dikes in Wuhan City has been carried out, with the construction of additional sub-dikes to prepare for even larger floods. At the same time, over ten thousand horsepower of water pumps have been concentrated to drain rainwater and standing water from the city. Furthermore, pre-prepared flood diversion areas on the Yangtze River's main stream and the Han River tributary upstream of Hankou have been used to actively divert floodwaters, easing the burden on Wuhan City. Recently, Wuhan and the Dongting Lake system have continued to experience heavy rainfall. On July 30th, the Wuhan Customs water level rose to 28.82 meters, exceeding the historical high water level by 0.54 meters. Wuhan City is still resolutely defending.

In mid-July, the Yangtze River also began to rise in the Sichuan section. The water level at the Shashi station of the Jingjiang Dike rose to 44.39 meters. To protect the safety of the Jingjiang Dike, the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project was opened on July 22nd, and the Shashi water level dropped continuously to 43.18 meters. Residents in the flood diversion area had been relocated to safe areas before the diversion. To maintain water storage capacity and prepare for the next flood peak from the Sichuan River, the floodgate was temporarily closed from July 27th to 28th. Currently, the second flood peak from the Sichuan River has begun to flow downstream. This flood peak is estimated to be larger and last longer than the previous one, and the Jingjiang flood diversion gate has been reopened for use. Although dangerous conditions are constantly occurring on the Jingjiang Dike, cadres at all levels and flood prevention personnel are resolutely carrying out tireless struggles under extremely difficult circumstances.

In total, more than ten thousand cadres and over six hundred thousand people and local People's Liberation Army troops are participating in flood prevention in Hubei and Wuhan City. In addition, Dongting Lake, Poyang Lake, Jiangsu, and Nanjing City are also under strict defense. Due to excessive rainfall and high water levels in the Yangtze River basin, many areas in Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces have suffered varying degrees of waterlogging and flood disasters. However, in areas where dikes have collapsed, residents have been relocated in advance based on water level forecasts and dike conditions, and proper resettlement has been carried out afterward, ensuring the safety of people's lives and reducing property losses.

The Huai River basin has experienced four major flood peaks since late June. The height of the flood peaks and the volume of water have exceeded those of 1950 and 1931. The flood prevention and water storage projects built over the years have all played a role, and have exceeded their flood defense tasks. For example, the Shimantan, Banqiao, Boshan, and Baisha reservoirs and the Laowangpo depression storage project in the upper reaches have all retained or stored floodwater, and some reservoirs have been filled, with spillways starting to overflow. This has played an important role in reducing floods on the Hong River, Ru River, and Ying River. Because this year's flood is exceptionally large, and the water storage projects in the upper reaches of each river have not been fully completed, the middle reaches bear a particularly heavy burden. Above Zhengyangguan, the Menghe depression, and the Huoqiu Chengxi Lake, Shouxian Shouxihu, and Wabuhu storage lakes have all been filled with floodwater, and some have exceeded their planned storage capacity. The Foziling Reservoir has also stored water and overflowed from the spillway. To ensure the safety of the ensured areas above the guaranteed water level, the Huai River Harnessing Committee put forward the slogan "raise dikes as water rises," mobilizing tens of thousands of people to universally build one-meter-high sub-dikes on the hundreds of miles of Huai River dikes from the Ying River to Hongze Lake, as well as on the embankments of Bengbu and Huainan cities, basically completing this work by July 22nd and 23rd. However, due to the fact that the Huai River harnessing project has not been fully completed and the amount of rainfall and water is excessive, many areas are still suffering from varying degrees of waterlogging disasters.

The Jiangba water level of Hongze Lake in the lower reaches is also gradually rising. Because it is expected that the amount of floodwater coming from the upper and middle reaches is very large and will last for a long time, the Sanhe闸 and Gaoliangjian闸 are releasing as much water as possible within the discharge capacity of the Jiangsu river channel dikes, so that the Hongze Lake water level does not become too high, and to prepare for the continued influx of water from the upper and middle reaches. To protect the safety of the Subei Lixiahe area, the Subei people are also closely guarding the east dike of the Grand Canal.

According to weather forecasts, the water situation in the Yangtze and Huai River basins will not fundamentally improve for a certain period of time. All localities are actively preparing, resolutely defending, and making continued efforts to fight for the final victory over the floods.

    长江、淮河防汛工作进入最紧张阶段
    广大人民应再接再厉战胜洪水
    【本报讯】今年汛期，由于气象上的特殊情况，暴雨区集中在长江流域的广大面积上，雨期特长，雨量特大。长江水位超过一九三一年与一九四九年，造成近百年来未有的大水。如城陵矶一九三一年最高水位三三·一九公尺，一九四九年最高水位三三·二九公尺，今年达三四·○八公尺。九江一九三一年最高水位二○·五三公尺，一九四九年二○·九二公尺，今年达二二·○八公尺。南京一九三一年最高水位九·二九公尺，今年达九·六三公尺。武汉关一九三一年最高水位二八·二八公尺，但在二六·九四公尺时，武汉市即已决口被淹，今年自七月二日起，水位达二七公尺，七月十八日达二八·三一公尺，七月三十日达二八·八二公尺，水位持续在一九三一年决口水位以上已近一月，持续在历年最高水位已逾十日。淮河流域自七月初起也普降大雨，雨量大而雨期长，也超过了一九五○年及一九三一年的大水。如正阳关历年最高水位是二四·七七公尺，今年七月二十六日水位涨达二六·四一公尺。因此，目前长江、淮河的防汛工作已进入最紧张的阶段。
    今年长江洪水，因五、六月间鄱阳湖水系及洞庭湖水系先后涨水，六月十六日鄱阳湖水位即超过历年最高水位，六月三十日安庆水位超过历年最高水位，七月二日洞庭湖岳阳水位亦超过历年最高水位，五、六月间汉口水位更为九十年来同一时期的最高水位。因为长江的水甚高，所以在七月上旬大雨之后，汉口水位即直线上升。为了保护武汉市的安全，武汉市防汛指挥部已根据气象与水情预报作了长期防御的布置，武汉市人民在防汛指挥部领导下，进行着英勇顽强的斗争。一方面对武汉市长达一百余公里的堤防，普遍检查加固，并增筑子埝，争取防御更大的洪水，同时集中万匹马力以上的抽水机，排除市内雨涝积水。并在汉口以上的长江干流及支流汉水上利用事先准备好的分洪区主动分洪，以减轻武汉市的负担。最近，在武汉地区及洞庭湖水系仍连降暴雨，七月三十日，武汉关水位已涨至二八·八二公尺，超过历年最高水位○·五四公尺。武汉市仍在坚决防守中。
    七月中旬长江在四川部分亦开始涨水，荆江大堤沙市站水位曾涨达四四·三九公尺，为保护荆江大堤的安全，荆江分洪工程于七月二十二日开闸分洪，沙市水位即连续降落到四三·一八公尺。分洪区内群众在分洪以前均已迁至安全区。为保持蓄洪容量，迎接川江下次洪峰，七月二十七日至二十八日进洪闸曾一度关闭。目前，川江第二次洪水峰，已开始下泄，这次洪水峰估计要比上次更大，时间亦长，荆江分洪进洪闸已再度开启使用。荆江大堤虽不断发生险工，但各级干部及防汛群众在极端困难情况下，仍坚决地进行着不倦的斗争。
    总计湖北及武汉市参加防汛的干部在万人以上，群众及人民解放军驻当地部队六十余万人，安徽长江两岸参加防汛的群众达一百万人。此外洞庭湖、鄱阳湖、江苏、南京市亦在严密防守中。由于长江流域雨量过大及水位过高，湖北、湖南、江西、安徽、江苏等省的许多地区都遭受到轻重不同的内涝与洪水灾害。但在堤垸溃漫地区事前根据水情预报及堤防情况，群众业已迁移，事后妥善地进行了安置，保障了人民生命的安全，并减轻了财产的损失。
    淮河流域自六月下旬起，已发生四次巨大洪水峰，洪峰之高与水量之大已超过一九五○年与一九三一年。历年所修防洪蓄水工程均已发挥作用，并超额地担负了它们防御洪水的任务。如上游石漫滩、板桥、薄山、白沙等水库及老王坡等洼地蓄洪工程，都已拦洪或蓄洪，有的水库并已蓄满，溢洪道开始溢洪。对削减洪河、汝河及颍河的洪水起了重要作用。由于今年洪水特大，各河上游的蓄水工程尚未全部修建完成，因之中游负担特重。正阳关以上，濛河洼地，霍邱城西湖、寿县寿西湖、瓦埠湖等蓄洪湖泊，都已满蓄洪水，有的并超过了计划蓄洪容量。佛子岭水库亦已蓄水并自溢洪道溢洪。为争取在保证水位以上保护确保区的安全，治淮委员会提出“水涨堤高”的口号，动员十数万人，在颍河至洪泽湖数百里的淮堤及蚌埠、淮南市围堤上，普遍加筑一公尺的子埝，至七月二十二、二十三日已基本完成。但由于治淮工程尚未全部完成以及雨量水量过多过大，仍有不少地区遭受轻重不同的水涝灾害。
    下游洪泽湖蒋坝水位，亦逐渐上涨。因为预计到上、中游洪水来量甚大，时间甚长，三河闸及高良涧闸均在江苏河道堤防所能承泄的范围内，尽量放水排洪，以使洪泽湖水位不致过高，迎接上、中游继续来水。为保护苏北里下河区的安全，苏北人民对运河东堤亦在严密防守中，
    根据气象预报，长江与淮河流域的水情在一定时期内还不能根本好转，各地正在积极准备，坚决防守，再接再厉，为最后战胜洪水而奋斗。
