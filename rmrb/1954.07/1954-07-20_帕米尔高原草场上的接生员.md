    Midwives on the Pastures of the Pamir Plateau
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter Wang An
    In a vast pasture on the edge of the Pamir Plateau in the second district and first township of Wuqia County, Xinjiang, from August of last year to May of this year, more than 150 tents saw the addition of thirty-two healthy babies, fifteen of whom were delivered using new methods. The elderly herders all said: This is the greatest joyous event that has ever occurred on the pasture.
    The survival of these infants has made midwives Suhe Suer, Ji Yemubi, and Tuerna Han the most popular guests in the herders' tents. The three of them are all Kirgiz women in their twenties. When Suhe Suer was a child, her mother gave birth to a younger brother, but after a few days, the brother died. Her mother held him, weeping and unable to let go, and Suhe Suer also cried. From a young age, they deeply understood the pain experienced by Kirgiz mothers of "only seeing the birth of a child, but not hearing the child call for its mother." Originally, women on the pasture were accustomed to giving birth sitting on sheep dung. After the child was born, the mother would cut the umbilical cord herself with a knife. As a result, newborns often died from umbilical tetanus.
    In July 1953, Suhe Suer, Ji Yemubi, and Tuerna Han were grazing cattle and sheep in a deep mountain pasture when township clerk Shasike Baiyi asked them if they would be willing to go to Wuqia County, three hundred miles away, to learn new midwifery methods. They happily said they were willing. So, the three young women, who had never been far from home, rode camels for three days with the help of the township clerk and arrived at Wuqia County. They learned new midwifery methods in half a month. The three of them took a midwifery kit back to the pasture to promote the benefits of new midwifery methods to the herders. At first, the herders did not believe them, but after their repeated propaganda, the mothers who suffered the most began to believe them. One rainy day in August, Aiting Bi, a neighbor of Tuerna Han's tent, was about to give birth. Tuerna Han was both excited and worried about her first delivery, so she called Suhe Suer and Ji Yemubi. The three of them worked together to deliver a chubby baby boy for Aiting Bi. Aiting Bi was already forty years old, and she had given birth to five babies in the past while sitting on sheep dung, all of whom died shortly after birth. This time, she used the new method and the delivery was very smooth. When the women on the pasture heard the good news, they all brought ghee and milk to congratulate her and believed in the benefits of new midwifery methods. From then on, people often asked Suhe Suer, Ji Yemubi, and Tuerna Han to deliver babies. Regardless of wind, snow, or rain, they would travel over mountains and rivers whenever they were called.
    Once, it was already dark, and everyone was cooking dinner. A herder named Mulati Boeke ran over, covered in sweat, to ask Suhe Suer to deliver his wife, Aixia's, baby. Suhe Suer did not have time to eat and hurriedly followed Mulati Boeke. They climbed over two large mountains and did not reach Mulati Boeke's tent until midnight. She disregarded her hunger and fatigue and quickly opened her midwifery kit to deliver Aixia's baby. This March, the winter pastures were still covered in thick snow. Zeyina Mu had been in pain for five days, and the baby had not yet been born. Ji Yemubi watched over her day and night for five days. Although she was five months pregnant herself, she stayed up late into the night to keep the fire burning in the mother's room. Finally, Zeyina Mu safely gave birth to a little girl. When Ji Yemubi left, Zeyina Mu's sixty-year-old mother held her hand and cried with gratitude.
    Now, wherever Suhe Suer, Ji Yemubi, and Tuerna Han go, the owners of the tents welcome them in to drink milk and eat meat. The mothers affectionately hand their children over to them. Every time the herders on the pasture see them carrying their midwifery kits and hurrying past, they happily say: Another Kirgiz baby has been born on the pasture!

    帕米尔高原草场上的接生员
    新华社记者　王安
    新疆乌恰县二区一乡在帕米尔高原边缘的一片广大草场上，从去年八月到今年五月，这里的一百五十多顶帐篷中，新添了三十二个健壮的婴儿，其中十五个婴儿都是采用新法接生的。老年的牧民都说：这是草场上从来没有过的大喜事。
    这些婴儿的成活，使接生员苏合苏尔、吉叶木比和吐尔娜汗成为牧民帐篷中最受欢迎的客人。她们三个人都是二十来岁的柯尔克兹族妇女。苏合苏尔小时候，母亲生了一个弟弟，过了几天，弟弟死了，母亲眼泪汪汪抱着弟弟不放，苏合苏尔也哭了。她们从小就深深知道柯尔克兹族母亲们经受的“只见娘生儿，不见儿叫娘”的悲痛。原来，草场上的妇女习惯坐在羊粪上生孩子，孩子生下后，母亲就自己用刀子割断脐带，这样初生的婴儿常因患脐带破伤风症死去。
    一九五三年七月，苏合苏尔、吉叶木比和吐尔娜汗三人正在深山草场上放牧牛羊，乡文书沙斯克巴衣问她们愿不愿意到三百里外的乌恰县学习新法接生，她们高兴地说愿意。于是，三个从来没有出过远门的青年妇女，就在乡文书的帮助下，骑上骆驼走了三天，到达乌恰县。她们在半月内学会新法接生，三个人领了一个接生包回到草场向牧民宣传新法接生的好处。最初，牧民们还不相信，经过她们反复宣传，受痛苦最深的母亲们开始相信了。八月里一个下雨天，吐尔娜汗邻居帐篷的艾婷比要生孩子，吐尔娜汗第一次接生，又兴奋、又耽心，便把苏合苏尔和吉叶木比叫来，三个人共同为艾婷比接生了一个胖胖的男娃娃。艾婷比已经四十岁了，过去坐在羊粪上生了五个娃娃，都是下地后不久就死了，这次用新法接生很平安。草场上的妇女们知道这个喜讯后，都拿了酥油、奶子来贺喜，并相信了新法接生的好处。从此，就常常有人请苏合苏尔、吉叶木比和吐尔娜汗去接生。她们也不论刮风下雪，翻山涉水，都是随请随去。
    有一次，天已经黑了，家家都在煮晚饭。一个叫木拉提伯克的牧民满头大汗的跑来请苏合苏尔去为他的妻子艾霞接生，苏合苏尔来不及吃饭，就急急忙忙跟木拉提伯克走去，爬过两座大山，半夜才到了木拉提伯克的帐篷。她顾不得饥饿和疲乏，急忙打开接生包给艾霞接生。今年三月，冬季草场上还积着厚雪，泽衣娜木肚子痛了五天，婴儿还没有生下来，吉叶木比寸步不离的看护了五天，她自己已怀孕五个月还深更半夜不睡觉，给产妇房子里架火。最后，泽衣娜木平安地生下了一个小女孩。吉叶木比走时，泽衣娜木六十岁的老母亲拉着她的手感激得哭了起来。
    现在，苏合苏尔、吉叶木比和吐尔娜汗走到那里，那里帐篷的主人就欢迎她们进去喝奶子、吃肉，母亲们把孩子亲热地递到她们怀中。草场上的牧民每次看见她们背着接生包急急地走过时，都高兴的说：草场上又多了一个柯尔克兹的娃娃啦！
