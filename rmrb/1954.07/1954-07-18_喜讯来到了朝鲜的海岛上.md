Good News Arrives on a Korean Island
Zhang Zilin

On June 24th, the "People's Daily" containing the "Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China" was delivered to a remote island in the West Sea of Korea. The Chinese People's Volunteer Army's coastal defense soldiers stationed on the island greeted this day's "People's Daily" with great joy.

It was already 10 a.m., and the island was still shrouded in thick fog. The news of the publication of the draft constitution spread like wind through the fog, from the command post to the front-line positions, from the eastern coastal defense positions to the ears of the sentries on the western reefs, and from the front-line observation post all the way to the maritime patrol team. The newspaper also seemed to grow wings, flying from one hand to another. It was crumpled, but people still greedily read, recited, and passed it around.

The first to receive the newspaper from the command post was Liu Wenyou, a soldier on the front-line position. The young man jumped into the fortifications, panting, and before he could even stand still, he shouted, "Important news! Important news!"
	"The draft constitution has been published!" the soldiers said excitedly, gathering around. Liu Wenyou held the newspaper, swaying his body, and read aloud, reciting all 106 articles in one breath. After reading, people were moved by a feeling of excitement, and for a long time, they were speechless. It was Liu Wenyou who broke the silence: "We should pay tribute to Chairman Mao, who personally led the drafting of the constitution! Pay tribute to Beijing!" Liu Wenyou's words ignited like a fire in people's hearts, and they stood up and shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the Chinese Communist Party!"

At noon, the newspaper was delivered to a small observation post on the mountaintop. The observers temporarily put down their binoculars, stood up from the low shed, and crowded together, reading excitedly. When they passed the newspaper to another position, they sang a favorite song:

	High is White Cloud Mountain,
	Standing tall south of the Han River in Korea,
	MacArthur wanted to invade from here,
	Our heroes stopped him before the mountain!
	…
	Heroes stand tall on the mountain peak,
	The heroes' blood shines brightly,
	…
	White Cloud Mountain, White Cloud Mountain, high White Cloud Mountain,
	Let us sing your heroic name and move forward!

They had sung this song countless times during the war and after the armistice, but today it felt particularly powerful.

This is a song that marks the honor of this unit. Two years ago, the unit that came to this island defended the position on White Cloud Mountain, 540 meters above sea level on the south bank of the Han River, for fifteen days and nights, crushing MacArthur's combined land and air attack that outnumbered them six to one, and annihilating more than 1,400 enemies. They are a heroic unit that the people of the whole country once sang about. Since then, they have overcome countless difficulties on this desolate island far from the motherland and the mainland, conquering the ocean and defeating the American and Rhee bandits at sea, making the island a solid front-line position in the West Sea. Now, they recall the combat journey they have traveled, and everyone is very excited. Chen Shaoliang, a soldier who participated in the fourth battle of the Korean War, recounted with great emotion the suffering he endured in the old society and the heroic struggles in the Korean War. Finally, he said: "The blood of the comrades was not shed in vain, and our struggle has paid off greatly. This time, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, our country has fixed the fruits of the revolution in legal form, the people have further gained democracy, the people have some basic rights, and the people are protected by law. This is really a great happy event for the working people!"

Lu Duomei, a 19-year-old soldier who excellently completed his mission in the battle on the south bank of the Han River, and Ruan Youde, a meritorious combatant who defended the sandy beach position on Fuli Island in the middle of the Han River for twenty-five days and nights, both recalled those years on the Korean battlefield. They clearly remembered that many comrades heroically sacrificed in the battle of White Cloud Mountain. Before their sacrifice, they shouted: "For the motherland, for the cause of peace, it is glorious to sacrifice!"

"For the motherland, for what motherland?" Ruan Youde described his feelings at that time: "It is to create a peaceful environment for the motherland, and hope that the motherland will realize socialism as soon as possible! This is our wish, and now this wish is clearly stipulated in the draft constitution. The draft constitution also clearly stipulates that 'Defending the motherland is the sacred duty of every citizen of the People's Republic of China.' In the past, we did a little bit to defend the motherland, and of course, we cannot slack off in the future. We must do our best to defend the socialist construction of the motherland and defend the implementation of the constitution. Article 20 of the draft constitution also writes down our wish: 'The armed forces of the People's Republic of China belong to the people. Their task is to defend the achievements of the people's revolution and national construction, and to defend the security of the country and the integrity of its territorial sovereignty.'"

This is not only Ruan Youde's wish, but also the wish of all officers and soldiers guarding the island. Many soldiers wrote Article 20 and Article 103 of the draft constitution neatly in their notebooks, and some even memorized them by heart. Dai Fangji, a soldier who has been awarded the Second Class Merit once and the Third Class Merit three times, wrote in his little red book: "We must turn the island into an unsinkable warship. Defending the island is to defend the security and construction of the motherland, and to defend the implementation of the constitution!"

Night fell. The island became quiet again. The sentries watched the sea even more vigilantly, and the observers constantly recorded every tiny activity at sea. Sometimes, their eyes were blurred, everything was blurred, they rubbed their eyes and continued to look out. Soldier Liu Jinggui said:
	"I am determined to defend the implementation of the constitution, and will not allow anyone to harm it, damage it, or touch it at all!"

### 喜讯来到了朝鲜的海岛上

    喜讯来到了朝鲜的海岛上
    张子琳
    六月二十四日，登着“中华人民共和国宪法草案”的“人民日报”送到了朝鲜西海中的一个孤岛上。驻岛上的中国人民志愿军某部海防战士以狂喜的心情迎接了这天的“人民日报”。
    已经是上午十时了，岛上还被浓雾笼罩着。宪法草案公布的消息，像风一样地穿过浓雾，从指挥所传到前沿阵地，从东端的海滨阵地上，传到西边礁石上哨兵的耳朵里，从前沿观察所一直传到了海上巡逻队。报纸也像长了翅膀似地，从这个手里飞到那个手里，它被揉皱了，可是人们仍贪婪地阅读着，朗诵着，传递着。
    第一个从指挥所接到报纸的是前沿阵地上的战士刘文有。这个小伙子气喘喘地跳进工事里，身子还没有站稳，就喊着：“重要消息！重要消息！”
      “宪法草案公布了！”战士们兴奋地说着，集拢来。刘文有手拿着报纸，摇撼着身子，大声读着，一口气念完了一百零六条。读完了，人们被一种兴奋的事情激动着，许久说不出话来。还是刘文有打破了这个沉默：“我们应该向亲自领导制定宪法草案的毛主席致敬！向北京致敬！”刘文有的话像火一样，马上在人们心中燃烧了，他们站起来喊着：“毛主席万岁！”“中国共产党万岁！”
    中午，报纸送到了山巅上的一个小观察所。观察员们暂时摘下望远镜，从低矮的棚里站起来，挤在一起，兴奋地阅读着。当他们把报纸传到另一个阵地时，他们就唱起了一支心爱的歌曲：
    高高的白云山，
    矗立在朝鲜汉江南，
    麦克阿瑟要从这儿进犯，
    我们的英雄叫他停止在山前！
    ……
    英雄昂立在山巅，
    英雄的鲜血光辉灿烂，
    ……
    白云山，白云山，高高的白云山，
    让我们歌唱着你的英名，向前！
    这支歌曲他们在战争中和停战后不知唱过多少遍了，但今天唱起来感到一种特别有力量。
    这是一支标志着这个部队荣誉的歌曲。两年前来到在这个海岛上的部队，在汉江南岸拔海五四零公尺的白云山上坚守阵地十五昼夜，粉碎了麦克阿瑟的六倍于他们的陆军、空军联合进攻，歼敌一千四百余名。他们是全国人民曾经歌唱过的一支英雄部队。从此以后，他们就在这远离祖国，远离大陆的荒无人烟的孤岛上，克服了无数困难，战胜了海洋，战胜了海上的美李海盗，使海岛成为西海前沿的坚固阵地。现在，他们回忆起自己所走过的战斗路程，每个人都非常激动。曾经参加过朝鲜第四次战役的战士陈绍良无限感慨地叙述了他在旧社会受的苦难，在朝鲜战争中的英勇斗争。最后他说：“同志们的血没有白流，我们的斗争得到了伟大的代价。这回，我们国家在共产党和毛主席的领导下，把革命的胜利成果用法律形式固定了下来，人民进一步得到了民主，人民有那么些基本权利，人民得到法律上的保护，这真是劳动人民一件大喜事！”
    在汉江南岸战斗中，出色完成任务的十九岁的战士吕多梅，和在汉江中间坚守浮里岛沙滩阵地二十五昼夜的大功功臣阮有德，都回忆了从前在朝鲜战场上的那些岁月。他们清楚地记得在白云山战斗中，许多同志在战斗中英勇牺牲了。他们在牺牲前还喊着：“为祖国，为和平事业，牺牲了也是光荣的！”
    “为祖国，为祖国什么呢？”阮有德述说着那时候的心情：“就是为祖国创造一个和平环境，希望祖国早日实现社会主义啊！这就是我们的愿望，现在这个愿望宪法草案上都明确地规定了。宪法草案还明确规定‘保卫祖国是中华人民共和国每一个公民的神圣职责。’过去，我们为保卫祖国尽了一点点力量，今后当然更不能松懈，要尽更大的力量，保卫祖国社会主义的建设，保卫宪法的实施。宪法草案第二十条也写下了我们这样的心愿：‘中华人民共和国的武装力量属于人民，它的任务是保卫人民革命和国家建设的成果，保卫国家的安全和领土主权的完整。’”
    这不只是阮有德的心愿，而是所有守卫在海岛上指战员的心愿。有许多战士把宪法草案第二十条、一百零三条端端正正地写在自己的笔记本上，有的还背得滚熟。曾立过二等功一次、三等功三次的战士戴方吉，在自己的小红本子上写着：“我们要把海岛变成一只打不沉的军舰。守住海岛，就是保卫祖国的安全和建设，保卫宪法的实施！”
    夜幕降落了。岛上重新寂静下来。哨兵们更加警惕地注视着海面，观察员不断地记录下来海上每一个微小的活动情况。有时候，眼睛望花了，一切都模糊了，揉揉眼睛又继续了望。战士刘景贵说：
  “我有决心保卫宪法的实施，不准任何人来伤害它，损害它，碰它一点！”
