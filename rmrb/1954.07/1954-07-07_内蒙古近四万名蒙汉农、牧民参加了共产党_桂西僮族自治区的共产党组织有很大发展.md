In recent years, Party building work in the agricultural areas of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has greatly developed. Across the region, more than 39,950 outstanding farmers and herdsmen of Mongolian, Han, and other ethnic groups have joined the Communist Party of China; Party grassroots organizations have been established in 88.5% of villages. Party members have also been developed and branches established in key pastoral areas.

Party organizations in rural areas have become the leading core in implementing the Party and the People's Government's policies and developing agricultural production through mutual aid and cooperation. More than 90% of Party members participate in mutual aid and cooperative organizations, actively leading farmers on the socialist road, and many Party members hold leadership positions in mutual aid and cooperative organizations. Rural Party branches actively led farmers in carrying out patriotic production increase campaigns and agricultural technology reform movements, and struggled against natural disasters such as water, drought, and pests, ensuring the completion of production increase tasks. Because Party members actively participate in mutual aid and cooperative organizations and maintain close ties with the masses, they have gained the trust of the broad masses of farmers, who call rural Party members their guides.

In pastoral areas, the Party has focused on recruiting outstanding herdsmen and establishing branches. Party members in pastoral area branches generally actively organize and lead pastoral mutual aid organizations, becoming the leading core in carrying out the mutual aid and cooperation movement in pastoral areas. Hu Heletai, a Communist Party member from the Chen Barag Banner in Hulunbuir League, who organized and led a pastoral mutual aid group, has become a model for the broad masses of herdsmen in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region to emulate. Hu Heletai always chooses the most arduous tasks to do in the collective labor of the mutual aid group, using his own exemplary actions to influence the herding masses.

Xinhua News Agency: Furthermore, Party building work in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region has penetrated into mountainous and remote rural areas. In counties such as Du'an, Longjin, Jingxi, Mubian, Tianlin, Lingle, Tian'e, and the Miao Autonomous Region in Damiao Mountain, and the Dong Autonomous Region in Sanjiang County alone, more than 1,490 outstanding farmers of Zhuang, Yao, Miao, Dong, Han, and other ethnic groups had joined the Communist Party of China by the end of March this year, more than double the number of Party members at the end of 1953. Communist Party members are actively taking the lead in promoting production in mountainous areas. In February this year, Nonghe Township in Du'an County developed nine new Party members and established the Nonghe Township Branch of the CPC. Under the leadership of the Party branch, Yao and Zhuang farmers in the township organized 58 mutual aid groups, with the number of households participating in mutual aid groups accounting for 89% of the total number of households in the township. The mutual aid group led by Party member Meng Bunong (Yao nationality) formulated a production plan and applied more green manure to the group's 62.3 mu of mountain land, resulting in excellent crop growth. In Luohui Township, Longjin County, a remote area, all 12 Communist Party members in the township fully participated in mutual aid groups and agricultural production cooperatives, with nine of them serving as group leaders and cooperative directors. Li Tuan, secretary of the Luohui Township Branch of the CPC, took the lead in carrying manure from ponds and digging up sod, promoting the widespread accumulation of fertilizer by farmers throughout the township. The Xiangfen Township Branch of the CPC in the Damiao Mountain, based on the characteristics of the mountainous area, invited veteran farmers to participate in discussions and promoted the experience of veteran farmers in weeding, ditching, and irrigating shallowly to increase production, as well as digging ditches vertically and horizontally on slopes to prevent rapid erosion, maintain topsoil, and facilitate cultivation, which was welcomed by Miao farmers.

CPC branches and Party members of various ethnic groups distributed across various locations organize and convene consultation meetings of representatives of various ethnic groups to help mediate ethnic disputes and strengthen ethnic unity. In Wuren Township, Zhendu County, farmers of various ethnic groups had for many years had disputes over issues such as mountain forests, water conservancy, and land boundaries, causing disunity between and within ethnic groups. After the township branch repeatedly held meetings to study solutions, Party members went deep into the masses to understand the situation and resolved ethnic disputes throughout the township in just over ten days. In addition, Party committees at all levels in the CPC Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region have formulated work plans for developing the Party and consolidating the Party based on the specific conditions in various places, and have successively dispatched large numbers of cadres to go deep into rural areas to carry out Party building work in conjunction with production.

    内蒙古近四万名蒙汉农、牧民参加了共产党
    桂西僮族自治区的共产党组织有很大发展
    内蒙古自治区农业地区党的建设工作，几年来有很大的发展，全区已有三万九千九百五十多名蒙、汉等民族的优秀的农民和牧民参加了中国共产党；在百分之八十八点五的农村建立了党的基层组织。在牧业区也有重点地发展了党员，建立了支部。
    农村中党的组织，已成为贯彻党和人民政府各项政策和发展农业生产互助合作的领导核心。有百分之九十多的党员参加了互助合作组织，积极领导农民走社会主义道路，很多党员都担任了互助合作组织中的领导工作。农村党支部积极领导农民开展了爱国主义增产竞赛和耕作技术改革运动，向水、旱、虫等自然灾害进行了斗争，保证了增产任务的完成。由于党员积极参加互助合作组织，密切联系群众，因此获得了广大农民的信任，群众称农村党员是他们的带路人。
    在牧业区，党有重点地吸收了优秀牧民，建立了支部。牧业区支部党员一般的都积极组织领导了牧业互助组织，成为牧业区开展互助合作运动的领导核心。呼伦贝尔盟陈巴尔虎旗共产党员胡和勒泰，组织领导的牧业互助组就已成为内蒙古自治区广大牧民学习的榜样。胡和勒泰在互助组集体劳动中总是挑选最艰苦的工作去做，以自己的模范行动去影响牧民群众。
    又讯：广西省桂西僮族自治区建党工作已深入到山区和边远农村。仅都安、龙津、靖西、睦边、田林、凌乐、天峨等县和大苗山苗族自治区、三江县侗族自治区等地，到今年三月底已有一千四百九十多名僮、瑶、苗、侗、汉等族优秀的农民加入中国共产党，党员数量比一九五三年底增加一倍多。共产党员积极带头推动了山区的生产。都安县弄河乡今年二月发展新党员九名，建立了中共弄河乡支部，全乡瑶、僮族农民在党支部的领导下，组织了五十八个互助组，参加互助组的户数占全乡总户数的百分之八十九。党员蒙卜浓（瑶族）领导下的互助组，订出生产计划，全组六十二亩三分山地，多施了绿肥，作物生长很好。在边远地区的龙津县罗回乡，全乡十二个共产党员完全参加了互助组和农业生产合作社，其中有九人担任了组长、社长。中共罗回乡支部书记李团，带头挑塘泥、铲草皮等，推动全乡农民普遍积肥。中共大苗山香粉乡支部根据山区特点，邀请老农座谈，并推广了老农们除草、开沟、灌水较浅得到增产，以及在坡地上纵横开沟，防止急流冲刷，保持表土，便于耕作的经验，受到苗族农民的欢迎。
    分布各地的中共支部和各民族党员，组织和召开各民族代表协商会，帮助调解民族纠纷，加强了民族团结。镇都县五仁乡各族农民多年来曾因山林、水利、地界等问题发生纠纷，造成民族间和民族内部的不团结，经乡支部多次开会研究解决办法，党员分别深入群众了解情况，在十多天内解决了全乡民族间的纠纷。此外，中共桂西僮族自治区各级党委根据各地具体情况都拟订了发展党和巩固党的工作计划，已先后抽调大批干部深入农村，结合生产开展建党工作。　（新华社）
