    Central Railway Ministry Decides to Continue the Overloading, Over-Axle Weight, and Five Hundred Kilometers Movement
    In order to mobilize and organize the vast number of employees to accelerate the turnaround of locomotives and rolling stock, increase vehicle loading capacity, unleash the potential of existing equipment, and smoothly complete the transportation plan, the Central People's Government Railway Ministry has decided to continue the overloading, over-axle weight, and five hundred kilometers movement. Based on the current transportation situation, equipment conditions, and shortcomings in the work, the Railway Ministry instructed its bureaus that the following key points should be grasped when continuing to carry out the overloading, over-axle weight, and five hundred kilometers movement: 1. Strictly combat the under-axle weight phenomenon, and steadily organize over-axle weight on the basis of full axle weight; 2. Drive according to the train timetable, and strive to shorten the non-productive dwell time of locomotives and rolling stock; 3. Strengthen education on abiding by technical management regulations and labor discipline to prevent accidents; 4. Strengthen the planning of small shunting operations; 5. Reduce unreasonable single-engine operation; 6. Improve loading methods to fully utilize the volume and load capacity of freight cars on the basis of safety; 7. Promote advanced methods and improve the technical level of employees; 8. Rationally organize the labor force to avoid blind rushes and overtime.
    The Railway Ministry also instructed the bureaus to proceed with distinctions and focus depending on the volume of business, the foundation of work, and the equipment conditions. In order to promote concerted action in all departments, competitions should also be organized between traffic, freight, and dispatch personnel at all levels, advanced dispatch methods should be promoted, train arrival forecasts should be improved, and shunting operations within stations should be organized. At the same time, the technical operations of joint work between stations and enterprise special lines should be improved, daily loading plans for train assembly by destination should be implemented, freight owners should be coordinated to improve double operations, loading and unloading should be organized day and night, and loading and unloading time should be shortened.
    The Railway Ministry has formulated the key points of technical organization measures for locomotive, traffic, business, rolling stock, engineering, and electrical engineering and other transportation-related departments, and also stipulated the measures for other departments to cooperate.

    中央铁道部决定
    继续开展满载、超轴、五百公里运动
    中央人民政府铁道部为了动员与组织广大职工，努力加速机车车辆周转，提高车辆装载量，发挥现有设备的潜在能力，顺利完成运输计划，决定继续开展满载、超轴、五百公里运动。根据当前运输情况、设备条件和工作缺点，铁道部指示各局，继续开展满载、超轴、五百公里运动应掌握下面几个重点：一、严格与欠轴现象作斗争，在满轴的基础上稳步地组织超轴；二、按照列车运行图行车，尽力缩短机车车辆非生产停留时间；三、加强遵守技术管理规程和遵守劳动纪律的教育，防止事故；四、加强小运转的计划性；五、减少不合理的单机运行；六、改进装载方法，在安全的基础上充分使用货车的容积和载重力；七、推广先进方法，提高职工技术水平；八、合理组织劳动力，避免盲目突击和加班加点现象。
    铁道部并指示各局应当根据业务量、工作基础和设备情况，有区别有重点地进行。为了推动各部门一致行动，还应组织各级行车、货物、调度人员之间的竞赛，推广先进调度方法，改善列车到达预报，组织站内调车作业。同时，改善车站与企业专用线联合工作的技术作业，执行按去向成组装车的日历装车计划，协同货主改善双重作业，组织日夜装卸，缩短装卸时间。
    铁道部制定了机务、车务、商务、车辆、工务、电务等行车有关部门的技术组织措施要点，也规定了其他部门配合工作的措施。
