    The US-UK Talks and America's "Policy of Strength"
    Cui Qi
    Recently, the heads of the US and British governments held talks in Washington and subsequently issued a joint statement and a joint declaration. The Washington authorities planned these talks with the aim of using blackmail and coercion to "adjust" their relations with major allies, in order to facilitate new provocations against the world's peace-loving people. However, Western press commentators have pointed out that these talks did not resolve the fundamental differences between the US and Britain.
    Washington orchestrated these talks at a time when the surrounding situation was quite unfavorable to it. The progress of the Geneva Conference in discussing the Indochina issue, and the rising movement among the French people and the people of Southeast Asian countries against the US's efforts to assemble a Southeast Asian aggressive bloc and expand the Indochina war, these facts demonstrate that the US's "policy of strength" is encountering new setbacks, and the contradictions within the capitalist camp are becoming more acute. It is precisely for this reason that American diplomats have appeared very anxious and uneasy recently. Washington focused its firepower on exerting greater pressure on London, and the American propaganda machine strongly coordinated, demanding that Britain adopt a "tough" attitude towards the Southeast Asian issue and other international issues.
    London's agreement to hold talks, and the choice of a "sudden" moment, naturally pleased Washington. However, Eden's speech in the British House of Commons on the eve of his trip to Washington made the atmosphere of discord and mistrust, as described by the US and British press, even more intense. Eden believed that the Geneva Conference "has a chance to reach an agreement on the Indochina issue," and said that the Southeast Asian aggressive bloc is not a "panacea." He also suggested reaching a "treaty" in Asia for the peaceful coexistence of "communist and non-communist countries." Eden also claimed that the talks between the Chinese and British delegations in Geneva had "improved Sino-British relations," and that "these talks have proven beneficial to our country and truly contribute to peaceful coexistence."
    According to US and British press reports on the talks, the US and Britain have "sharp contradictions" on the Far East issue, and the discussion of the Middle East issue, where the US and Britain are engaged in fierce struggle, was also extremely tense.
    The joint statement and joint declaration issued after the talks also proved this point. It did not mention the Middle East issue at all, and was vague about the Southeast Asian issue, which was obviously an attempt to conceal these differences.
    As everyone knows, the British government has repeatedly stated that it will not assume obligations on the issue of establishing a Southeast Asian aggressive bloc until the Geneva Conference yields results. Now the US-UK joint statement shows that, under US pressure, Britain has agreed that regardless of whether an agreement is reached on the Indochina issue, they "will work to promote a collective defense plan." Clearly, Britain made some concessions to the United States in the talks, and these concessions mean going down America's road to war. However, after the meeting, Churchill stated that Britain is still willing to "make a real attempt" to seek "peaceful coexistence" in Southeast Asia. Eisenhower then openly threatened this with "US aid" at a press conference, expressing his support for the decision made by some powerful groups in the House of Representatives to "prevent any funds in the foreign aid law from being used to support a" "treaty" that seeks peaceful coexistence in Southeast Asia. At the same time, the United States, through the US-Australia-New Zealand meeting, stated that "immediate action" must be taken to establish a Southeast Asian military bloc, further exerting pressure on Britain. It can be seen that the differences between the US and Britain have not only not eased after their talks, but are becoming increasingly superficial.
    Clearly, with the advent and development of the American economic crisis, and with the United States increasingly adopting adventurous plans and aggressive policies that fundamentally ignore reality, the differences and contradictions between the United States and Britain will be further deepened.
    The Washington talks exposed the United States' efforts to pull Britain together, attempting to confront the magnificent movement of Asian and European people striving for peace and national independence. Although the facts prove that this is unworkable, the United States is still painstakingly trying to intensify its adventurous aggression plans, organize hostile military blocs, suppress national liberation movements in various countries, and maintain a tense situation worldwide.
    Dulles stated even before the US-UK talks that the Geneva Conference would not produce any results and that "other paths" must now be "considered." However, Dulles clearly cannot help but feel that his orders are difficult to achieve, so new methods of blackmail and coercion have been taken out again. The US-UK "joint statement" declared in a tone closely resembling Dulles that if "an acceptable agreement cannot be reached" at the Geneva Conference, then "the international situation will seriously deteriorate."
    Everyone knows that the US delegation at the Geneva Conference has never put forward any proposals. There is not a shadow of any proposals in their briefcases. They can only say "no" and only reject any "acceptable agreement." Therefore, as explained by the US and British news agencies, the real meaning that Dulles wants to express in this statement is to coerce France into adopting a "tough" stance, thereby hindering the negotiated settlement of the Indochina issue.
    General opinion points out that the US and UK held separate talks behind France's back, which is a huge pressure on France. This is most blatantly manifested in the European Army issue. The participants of the US-UK talks attempted to seek "unity" on the European Army issue by sacrificing French interests. They expressed their "determination" to continue arming West Germany, "firmly support" the European Army Treaty, and openly and rudely demanded that France not "create additional problems" on the European Army issue, but must quickly approve this war treaty.
    At the same time, American political leaders and diplomats are launching a large-scale offensive against France: Eisenhower wrote a letter to French President Coty, making threats; American lawmakers stated that they would stop providing "aid" to France; American Ambassador to France Dillon publicly stated that if France does not quickly approve the European Army, the United States will establish an "independent German army." All of this is obviously intended to coerce France to act completely in accordance with the United States' intentions in Europe and its timetable for expanding its arms race.
    The interference of the United States across the Atlantic in French policy has obviously reached an extremely vicious level. However, apart from threats, inducements, and the imposition of pressure, the United States has no more "trump cards" in its hands. Facts have proven that the French people have the full power to decide their own destiny, and the United States cannot arbitrarily manipulate them.
    The French people are joining the people of the world in resolutely opposing the United States' evil policies of reviving West German militarism and expanding the Indochina war. Their will must not be ignored. The most prominent feature of the French political situation is that the forces striving for peace and national independence are constantly growing and playing an increasingly important role. Isn't the downfall of the Laniel-Bidault cabinet, which submissively followed US policy, powerful proof?
    It must be pointed out that the United States' desperate efforts to intensify the assembling of aggressive blocs in Europe and Asia are harboring sinister purposes. The authors of the US-UK joint declaration repeated their notorious "anti-communist" cliches, slandering the people's democratic countries as so-called "formerly independent and autonomous countries that are now bound." This exposed their deep-rooted hatred for the countries that have been freed from capitalist enslavement, and exposed the fact that the United States is putting pressure on its partners to force them to interfere in the affairs of other countries, thereby dragging them into a new world war. However, as pointed out by the Soviet "Pravda" editorial on July 3rd: "What does the outbreak of a new world war mean in the current international situation? Under the current conditions, the outbreak of war means that all the contradictions of imperialism are sharpened to the extreme, pregnant with all the inevitable consequences. Under such conditions, military adventures will be extremely dangerous for those who ignore the lessons of history and embark on this path."
    Today, hundreds of millions of people in Asia are enthusiastically welcoming the talks held successively by the Prime Ministers of China and India and the Prime Ministers of China and Myanmar. The attention of world opinion is focused here.
    The Sino-Indian and Sino-Myanmar talks and the Washington talks are in sharp contrast, clearly reflecting two distinct lines in current international relations. The purpose of the Sino-Indian and Sino-Myanmar talks is to consolidate peace in Asia and the world, and to enhance friendly relations between Asian countries; while the Washington talks are to block the path to peace, obstruct the negotiated settlement of international issues, and attempt to deepen the division of Europe and Asia, and open up sources of war profits for American monopoly capital. Therefore, under the light of the Sino-Indian and Sino-Myanmar talks, the Washington talks appear even more dim.
    People of all countries generally believe that the achievements of the Sino-Indian and Sino-Myanmar talks are of historic significance. The Sino-Indian and Sino-Myanmar talks sincerely announced the five principles guiding relations between the two countries, namely mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence. They unanimously expressed the hope that the Geneva Conference would reach an agreement on the Indochina issue and expressed their willingness to make joint efforts towards this goal. This clearly shows that the major countries in Asia oppose the United States' assembling of a Southeast Asian aggressive bloc and oppose the United States' policy of obstructing the restoration of peace in Indochina. The Washington schemers shamelessly regard themselves as the protectors of Asia, shamelessly saying that their aggressive and war policies in Asia are to protect Asia's "independence" and "freedom." However, the Asian people clearly told Washington that this sinister policy of the United States is unpopular in Asia, and therefore, unworkable.
    The great achievements of the Sino-Indian talks and the Sino-Myanmar talks, and the firm determination of the Asian people to defend peace and the continuous enhancement of friendly relations among Asian countries that it reflects, are a powerful answer to the aggressive policies of the American ruling clique in Asia. Facts have proven and will continue to prove that the American ruling clique, which clings to the "policy of strength," has not and cannot get any good results.

    美英会谈和美国的“实力政策”
    崔奇
    最近美英政府首脑在华盛顿举行了会谈，并先后发表了联合声明和联合宣言。华盛顿当局策划这次会谈的目的，是想用讹诈和胁迫的手段来“调整”它和主要盟国之间的关系，以便于它对世界爱好和平人民进行新的挑衅。但西方报刊的评论指出，这次会谈并没有解决英美之间的基本分歧。
    华盛顿策划这次会谈，是在周围的形势对它颇为不利的时候。日内瓦会议讨论印度支那问题的一些进展，法国人民和东南亚各国人民反对美国拼凑东南亚侵略集团、扩大印度支那战争的运动的高涨，这些事实说明了美国“实力政策”正在遭到新的挫败，资本主义国家阵营内部的矛盾更加尖锐化了。正是因为这样的缘故，近来美国外交家们显得非常的焦急和不安。华盛顿集中火力向伦敦施加更大的压力，美国宣传机器并作了强烈的配合，要英国对东南亚问题和其他国际问题采取“强硬”的态度。
    伦敦同意举行会谈，并选择了“突然”的时机，当然使华盛顿感到满意。但是，艾登赴华盛顿前夕在英国下院的演说，又使美英报刊所说的不和和不信任的气氛更加浓重了。艾登认为日内瓦会议“有在印度支那问题上达成协议的机会”，并说东南亚侵略集团不是“万应灵药”。他还建议在亚洲达成一种“共产主义国家和非共产主义国家”和平共处的“条约”。艾登并声称，中英两国代表团在日内瓦的会谈已使“英中关系有所改善”，“这些会谈已经证明有利于我国，并且真正有助于和平共处”。
    根据美英报刊关于会谈的报道，美英对远东问题有着“尖锐矛盾”，同时在讨论英美激烈斗争中的中东问题时也极为紧张。
    会谈结束后发表的联合声明和联合宣言，也证明了这一点。它对中东问题根本不提，对东南亚问题也含糊其词，这显然是竭力企图把这些分歧问题掩藏起来。
    大家知道，英国政府曾一再表示，在日内瓦会议未获结果以前，英国不对建立东南亚侵略集团问题承担义务。现在英美联合声明表明，在美国的压力下，英国同意不管印度支那问题达成协议与否，他们都“将努力推行集体防御计划”。很显然，英国在会谈中向美国作了一些让步，这些让步意味着沿着美国的战争道路走去。但是，会后邱吉尔表示，英国仍愿“作一番真正尝试”，在东南亚求得“和平共处”。于是艾森豪威尔在记者招待会上公然对此以“美援”来进行威胁，他表示赞成众议院一些有势力集团所作出的决定，“防止援外法中的任何款项被用来支持一个”在东南亚求得和平共处的
  “条约”。同时美国又通过美澳新会议，表示必须“立即采取行动”以建立东南亚军事集团，进一步对英国施加压力。由此可见，英美之间的分歧在他们的会谈后不但没有缓和，而且是越来越表面化了。
    很显然，随着美国经济危机的到来和发展，随着美国日益采取根本不顾现实的冒险计划和侵略政策，美国和英国之间的分歧和矛盾，还将要进一步加深。
    华盛顿会谈暴露了美国极力要把英国拉在一起，企图与亚洲人民和欧洲人民争取和平与民族独立的波澜壮阔的运动相对抗。虽然事实证明，这是行不通的，但美国仍在处心积虑地企图加紧推行冒险的侵略计划，组织敌对性的军事集团，镇压各国民族解放运动，维持世界范围的紧张局势。
    杜勒斯还在美英会谈之前就表示，日内瓦会议不会有什么结果，现在必须“考虑别的道路”。但是，杜勒斯显然不能不感到他的命令难以实现，于是，新的讹诈和胁迫手段就又拿出来了。美英“联合声明”竟以酷似杜勒斯的口吻宣称，在日内瓦会议上如果“一种可以接受的协议无法达成的话，那么，国际形势就会严重地恶化”。
    谁都知道，美国代表团在日内瓦会议上从来没有提出过任何一个建议，在他们的公文包里没有任何建议的影子，他们只会说一个“不”字，只会拒绝任何“可以接受的协议”。因此，正如美英通讯社所解释的那样，杜勒斯在这个声明中所要表达的真正的意思，是要威迫法国采取“强硬”立场，借此阻挠印度支那问题的协商解决。
    一般舆论指出，美英背着法国举行单独会谈，是对法国的巨大压力。这在欧洲军问题上表现得最为露骨。美英会谈的参加者企图用牺牲法国利益的办法在欧洲军问题上谋求“团结”。他们表示“决心”继续武装西德，“坚决支持”欧洲军条约，并公然粗暴地要求法国不得在欧洲军问题上“另生枝节”，而必须迅速批准这个战争条约。
    同时，美国政治首脑和外交家们正对法国展开了一个大规模的攻势：艾森豪威尔给法国总统戈蒂写信，进行威胁；美国议员们表示要停止对法国的
  “援助”；美国驻法大使狄龙公开声称，如果法国不赶快批准欧洲军，美国就要建立一支“独立的德国军队”。所有这些显然都是为了要挟法国完全按照美国在欧洲的意图及其扩军备战的时间表行事。
    大西洋彼岸的美国对法国政策的干涉，显然到了穷凶极恶的程度。但是，除了威胁利诱和横施压力以外，美国手中再没有什么“王牌”了。事实证明，法国人民完全有力量来决定自己的命运，美国是不可能任意加以摆布的。
    法国人民正和世界人民一道，坚决反对美国复活西德军国主义和扩大印度支那战争的罪恶政策，他们的意志是绝对不容漠视的。法国政治形势中最突出的特点就是争取和平与民族独立的力量正在不断增长并起着越来越大的作用。驯服地追随美国政策的法国主战派拉尼埃—皮杜尔内阁的垮台，不就是有力的证明吗？
    必须指出，美国这样不顾一切地要在欧洲和亚洲加紧拼凑侵略集团，是怀着阴险目的的。美英联合宣言的作者重复了他们的臭名远扬的“反共”滥调，诽谤人民民主国家是所谓“以前独立自主而现在受到了束缚的国家”，这就暴露了他们对于已经摆脱了资本主义奴役的国家的根深蒂固的仇视，暴露了美国正在给它的伙伴施加压力，要迫使它们一同去干涉别国的事务，从而把它们拖入新的世界大战。但是，正如苏联“真理报”七月三日社论中所指出：“在目前的国际局势下新的世界大战的爆发意味着什么呢？在现今的条件下，战争的爆发就意味着帝国主义的一切矛盾都尖锐到了极点，孕育着一切必然的后果。在这种条件下军事冒险对那些不顾历史的教训而走上这条路的人们就会有极其严重的危险。”
    今天，亚洲亿万人民正在热烈地欢迎中印两国总理和中缅两国总理先后所举行的会谈。全世界舆论的注意力都集中到这里来了。
    中印、中缅会谈和华盛顿会谈适成尖锐的对照，它显明地反映了目前国际关系中的两条截然不同的路线。中印、中缅会谈的目的，是为了巩固亚洲及世界和平，为了增进亚洲各国之间的友好关系；而华盛顿会谈则是为了堵塞和平的道路，阻挠国际问题的协商解决，并企图加深欧洲和亚洲的分裂，为美国垄断资本开拓战争利润的源泉。因此，在中印、中缅会谈的光芒照射下，华盛顿会谈是更加显得黯然失色了。
    各国人民普遍认为中印、中缅会谈的成就，是具有历史性的意义的。中印和中缅会谈真诚地宣布了指导两国之间关系的五个原则，即互相尊重领土主权，互不侵犯，互不干涉内政，平等互利，和平共处。他们一致表示希望日内瓦会议能对印度支那问题达成协议，并愿为这个目标作共同的努力。这显然表明，亚洲主要国家都反对美国拼凑东南亚侵略集团，反对美国阻挠恢复印度支那和平的政策。华盛顿野心家们居然以亚洲的保护人自居，恬不知耻地把它在亚洲推行的侵略政策和战争政策说成什么保障亚洲的“独立”、“自由”。但是，亚洲人民清楚地告诉了华盛顿，美国这种罪恶的政策在亚洲不得人心，因而也是行不通的。
    中印会谈和中缅会谈的重大成就，和它所反映出的亚洲人民保卫和平的坚定决心及亚洲各国友好关系的不断增进，就是对美国统治集团侵略亚洲政策的一个有力的回答。事实已经证明并将继续证明，死抓住“实力政策”不放的美国统治集团，并没有也不可能得到什么好结果的。
