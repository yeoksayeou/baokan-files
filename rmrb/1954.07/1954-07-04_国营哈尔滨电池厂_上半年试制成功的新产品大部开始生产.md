    State-owned Harbin Battery Factory
    Most of the New Products Successfully Trial-Produced in the First Half of the Year Have Started Production
    In the first and second quarters of this year, workers at the state-owned Harbin Battery Factory successfully trial-produced nearly twenty new products, most of which have already started production.
    In 1953, in addition to producing various dry batteries, the factory could only produce two types of copper-based graphite brushes, one type of carbon-based graphite brush, and a small number of carbon products. In the first and second quarters of this year, thirteen specifications and different performance grades of electric brushes were trial-produced according to advanced Soviet standards, solving the preliminary needs of generators and motors for general ground use. Electrical graphite brushes for medium-speed and high-speed thermal power generators, which China had never been able to manufacture in the past, have also been successfully trial-produced. Currently, these new products have been gradually supplied to relevant factories and mines for use, with good results.
    In addition to electric brushes, the factory has also successfully trial-produced pure carbon electrodes for spectral analyzers, which will soon be put into production. This is a powerful support for exploration teams conducting large-scale exploration of underground resources. Oil-containing alloy bearings for automobile engines and other high-speed machinery, carbon blocks with low-melting-point metals for automatic telephone protectors, and resistor slices for variable resistors used in film studios have also been successfully trial-produced and put into production. The oscillating electrodes and fixed electrodes in hearing aids for the deaf, which were recently successfully trial-produced by the Ministry of Light Industry, were also successfully trial-produced by the factory.

    国营哈尔滨电池厂
    上半年试制成功的新产品大部开始生产
    国营哈尔滨电池厂职工在今年第一、二季度中，试制成功了将近二十种新产品，其中大部分已开始生产。
    该厂在一九五三年内除生产各式干电池外，仅能生产两种铜质石墨刷、一种碳质石墨刷和少数碳素制品。今年第一、二季度内，按照苏联先进标准试制成了十三种规格和使用性能不同的电刷，解决了一般地面用的发电机和电动机的初步需要。过去我国从来不能制造的，供中速、高速火力发电机用的电气石墨刷亦已试制成功。目前，这些新产品已逐步供应有关厂矿使用，效果良好。
    除了电刷以外，该厂还试制成功光谱分析仪用的纯碳电极，即将开始生产，这是给大规模勘探地下宝藏的勘探队一个有力的支援；汽车发动机及其他高速机械用的含油合金轴承、自动电话保安器用的带低熔点金属的碳素块、电影制片厂用的可变电阻器的电阻片等亦已试制成功，并投入生产；轻工业部最近试制成功的耳聋助听器中的振荡电极及固定电极也是该厂试制成功的。
