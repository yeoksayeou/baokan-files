Citizens Have the Right to Education
	Zhang Jian

	Article 94 of the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China stipulates: "Citizens of the People's Republic of China have the right to education. The state establishes and gradually expands various schools and other cultural and educational institutions to guarantee citizens' enjoyment of this right. The state pays special attention to the physical and intellectual development of young people." This provision not only summarizes and consolidates the main achievements of the people's education since the founding of New China, but also further puts forward the basic tasks to be gradually realized by the national education cause in the future.

	In old China, education was a special right of the wealthy class. Although the Kuomintang reactionaries also stipulated so-called "People have the right and obligation to receive national education" and "Citizens have equal opportunities to receive education" and other high-sounding provisions in their "Constitution," the broad masses of working people lived in hunger and cold all year round and could not enjoy this right due to the Kuomintang reactionaries' cruel exploitation and oppression of the working people. Furthermore, due to the Kuomintang reactionaries' "policy of fooling the people," the education cause was extremely declining. In the Kuomintang reactionaries' national fiscal expenditure, education funds accounted for only a very small proportion. According to the "Constitution" passed by the Kuomintang reactionaries' pseudo-National Assembly in 1946, education funds accounted for 15 percent of the total national budget, but in reality, education funds only accounted for 5 percent in that year, and dropped to 2 percent in 1947. During the Kuomintang reactionaries' rule of more than 20 years, education funds accounted for 1 to 4 percent of the total national budget for 16 years. The limited education funds were not only often encroached upon by military spending, but also were subject to deductions, embezzlement, and waste at every level, with very little actually spent on education. Therefore, many school buildings were in disrepair for years, teaching equipment was extremely rudimentary, teachers' lives were not guaranteed, schools opened and closed intermittently, and children and young people deeply felt the pain of being out of school. Moreover, the education conducted at that time was a kind of brainwashing education that served the feudal landlord class, bureaucratic capitalists, and imperialism. The result of this kind of education was beneficial to the ruling class and harmful to the people.

	In New China, the situation is completely different. On the one hand, the broad masses of people have politically and economically turned over, thereby making it possible to enjoy the right to education; on the other hand, the people have become the masters of the country and are also in urgent need of education. On this basis, the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, in conjunction with the social and political reform movement and the restoration and development of the national economy, vigorously implemented the cultural and educational policies in the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, so that the national education cause not only rapidly recovered to the highest level before the war but also achieved great development.

	The care and concern of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government for the education cause can be illustrated by the following facts: First, the People's Government has allocated a large amount of education funds to meet the needs of the restoration and development of the education cause. For example, taking the social, cultural and educational funds allocated in 1950 as 100, it was 177.91 in 1951, 295.70 in 1952, and 460.89 in 1953. Among them, the national education funds allocated in 1953 were equivalent to 30 times the Kuomintang government in 1936, and 33 times in 1954. Second, various schools and other cultural and educational institutions have been gradually established and expanded. In the past few years, the People's Government has built more than 230,000 new primary schools, more than 700 secondary schools, and more than 20 institutions of higher learning in cities and villages across the country (because many old schools were merged in the adjustment of departments, the total number of schools is slightly less than before liberation), and established hundreds of thousands of vocational spare-time schools and people-run schools for farmers to study all year round. Third, vigorously train teachers. In 1953, the number of students in higher normal schools across the country was equivalent to 251 percent of the highest level before the war; the number of students in secondary normal schools across the country was equivalent to 150 percent before liberation. Fourth, provide people's scholarships to poor workers and peasants' children and young students. This kind of people's scholarship is increasing year by year with the increase in the number of students. For example, if the total amount of scholarships in higher normal schools across the country is taken as 100 in 1952, it increased to 228 in 1953 and to 272 in 1954. This has created opportunities for children of workers and peasants to enter school (of course, the main reason is that farmers have been distributed land through land reform, and workers' wages have increased year by year), thereby increasing the number of worker-peasant students in schools at all levels year by year. According to incomplete statistics, the proportion of worker-peasant students in colleges and universities across the country has increased from 13.8 percent in the early days of liberation to about 22 percent in 1953; in 1953, the proportion of worker-peasant students in secondary schools across the country accounted for 46 percent (secondary technical schools), 58 percent (middle schools) to 64 percent (normal schools); 58 worker-peasant quick-track middle schools have absorbed more than 28,900 worker-peasant cadres and industrial workers; children of workers and peasants in primary schools accounted for more than 80 percent of the total number of students. Fifth, schools at all levels give preferential treatment to students of domestic minority nationalities, such as relaxing admission standards, issuing more scholarships, providing a large number of teachers and teaching materials, and using the language and writing commonly used by their own nationalities for teaching, so that children of minority nationalities who have always been culturally backward have more opportunities to enter school. In 1953, more than 2.27 million children of minority nationalities across the country entered primary schools, more than 155,000 entered secondary schools, and more than 5,500 entered institutions of higher learning. Sixth, schools at all levels enroll both boys and girls when recruiting new students, and pay attention to persuading parents to send girls to school as much as possible. Since liberation, the proportion of female students in schools at all levels has been increasing year by year. For example, before liberation (1945), female students in primary schools across the country accounted for 25.52 percent of the total number of students, and in 1952 after liberation, it rose to 30.18 percent; female students in institutions of higher learning also rose from 17.8 percent before liberation (1947) to 25.28 percent in 1953.

	It is precisely because the People's Government has taken the above series of measures that the national school education cause has greatly developed. In 1953, there were about 50 million primary school students across the country, an increase of 1.3 times compared with the highest level during the Kuomintang rule; more than 3.62 million secondary school students, equivalent to 193 percent of the highest level before liberation; and more than 212,000 students in colleges and universities, equivalent to more than 170 percent of the highest level before liberation. In addition, in 1952, about 29 million farmers across the country participated in winter school learning, in 1953, about 2.58 million workers and staff members in factories and mines participated in spare-time school learning, and about 12 million farmers participated in year-round people-run schools. That is to say, more than one-tenth of the people across the country are currently participating in learning in schools at all levels and spare-time remedial schools, which is an unprecedented phenomenon in Chinese history.

	Article 94 of the Draft Constitution not only consolidates the achievements of the education cause in our country since its founding, but also proposes: "The state establishes and gradually expands various schools and other cultural and educational institutions to guarantee citizens' enjoyment of this right." This is the basic task of the national education cause in the future. The task stipulated in the Draft Constitution is completely possible to gradually realize. At present, the People's Government has taken and will take the following measures: First, in accordance with the principle of gradually improving the people's material and cultural living standards on the basis of developing production, and based on the possibility of the state's gradually increasing education funds, teacher training, school building construction, and supply of teaching materials and equipment, gradually expand various schools and other cultural and educational institutions. In order to enable various schools to achieve greater development and people in various places to more fully enjoy the right to education, attention should be paid to the rational distribution of the school network. Therefore, the People's Government has made overall provisions for this. In the future, the distribution of the school network of middle and primary schools will be based on the following principles: 1. Appropriately consider the distribution, density, and geographical conditions of the population (such as differences between mountainous areas and plains); 2. Under the conditions of limited national financial and human resources, give priority to meeting the requirements of children of workers and staff members in industrial and mining areas to enter school; 3. Appropriately take care of the special circumstances and different requirements of minority nationalities. The distribution of the network of colleges and universities and secondary vocational schools is distinguished according to the nature of the schools. For example, higher and secondary industrial schools are combined with industrial bases of similar nature so that factory and mine engineering and technical personnel can teach part-time, and schools can use the original machinery and equipment of factories and mines for production practice and scientific research nearby; medical schools are set up in the centers of large and medium-sized cities and are located together with affiliated hospitals; comprehensive universities are combined with scientific research institutions; agricultural and forestry schools are determined according to agricultural and forestry production and economic zoning; higher and secondary normal schools are determined according to the distribution and density of the population and the requirements for the development of general secondary and primary education in the future. In addition, in order to meet the urgent needs of the country for various construction talents, higher education and secondary vocational education will also have greater development.

	Second, according to the country's general task in the transition period and the basic tasks of the First Five-Year Plan for National Economic Construction, the First Five-Year Plan for Education is being drafted. The first priority of this plan is to ensure that construction talents are correspondingly trained for the country's various constructions, especially industrial construction; the second is to appropriately develop secondary and primary education based on the principle of appropriately improving the people's material and cultural living standards on the basis of developing production, and gradually meet the requirements of the working people, especially the children of workers and staff members in industrial and mining areas, to enter school. To this end, we must vigorously train teachers for schools at all levels. Higher normal education across the country will have great development. Together with the number of comprehensive university graduates who go to middle schools to serve as teachers, it is estimated that by 1957, the number of teachers in secondary schools across the country will increase by about 100% compared with the current total number of teachers. In addition to continuing to supplement hundreds of thousands of new teachers, primary education across the country must also gradually improve the political and cultural level and professional ability of the existing 1.45 million primary school teachers. This is a decisive step to improve teaching quality and a key to further guarantee citizens' enjoyment of the right to education.

	Third, necessary assistance and care will continue to be given to the enrollment of children of workers and peasants, minority nationalities, children of overseas Chinese, and women. In the past, the People's Government has accumulated a lot of experience in this area, and in the future, it will continue to make further efforts on the basis of consolidating the existing achievements.

	Finally, the People's Government will continue to allocate huge amounts of education funds to build school buildings and supplement teaching equipment, so as to guarantee citizens' enjoyment of the right to education materially. In the near future, not only will many new schools be built, but also the school buildings of many existing schools will be expanded. For example, the school buildings of Tsinghua University in Beijing are expected to be expanded by more than 100%, and the teaching equipment will be increased by five or six times. The school buildings of many general middle schools and secondary vocational schools will be expanded by about 100% compared with the existing ones. Some junior primary schools will also add school buildings required for senior primary classes. Moreover, due to the planned implementation of the two-shift system, the original school buildings and teaching equipment will play a greater role, thereby enabling more citizens to obtain the right to education.

	Undoubtedly, with the continuous growth of the country's economic strength, citizens' right to education will be further expanded.

	The youth of old China and their predecessors lived the same life of hunger and cold. Not only was the development of their physical strength limited, but also the development of their intelligence was adversely affected. After liberation, the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government paid special attention to the physical and intellectual development of young people. For example, in 1951, the State Council of the Central People's Government issued a decision on improving the health of students at all levels of schools. The basic spirit of the decision is to comprehensively develop the physical and intellectual strength of young students from aspects such as reducing the burden on students, improving students' food, and strengthening recreational activities and physical exercises. In 1952, the State Council made unified provisions for the People's Scholarships issued to schools above the secondary level: the People's Scholarships were issued to all students in colleges and universities and secondary vocational schools (including normal schools), which not only completely exempted students from food expenses but also solved the difficulties of poor students in terms of clothing and pocket money; scholarships were issued to some students in general middle schools, which provided necessary subsidies for students from poor families. The total amount of scholarships spent by the People's Government in 1954 was equivalent to four times the national education funds of the Kuomintang reactionaries in 1936. In 1953, Comrade Mao Zedong issued the instruction of "Good health, good study, and good work" to the youth of the whole country, which made schools at all levels pay more attention to the physical and intellectual development of young people. Now, Article 94 of the Draft Constitution clearly stipulates: "The state pays special attention to the physical and intellectual development of young people." It is completely believable that with the development of the country's economic construction, the youth of New China will live a happier life.

	Why do the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government pay such special attention to the physical and intellectual development of young people? The reason is that only by enabling young people to achieve comprehensive development of their physical and intellectual strength can we train truly healthy citizens for the country. That is to say, to build our motherland into a great socialist country, we need citizens who have a certain level of cultural and scientific knowledge and strong physique to participate in construction work and defend the security of the motherland.

	Comrade Mao Zedong once predicted in his opening speech at the First Plenary Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference: "With the arrival of the high tide of economic construction, a high tide of cultural construction will inevitably appear. The era when the Chinese people were considered uncivilized has passed, and we will appear in the world as a nation with a high degree of culture." And Article 94 of the Draft Constitution is a proof of the realization of this prediction, and it is also the direction in which efforts should be made to continue to realize this prediction in the future.

    公民有受教育的权利
    张健
    中华人民共和国宪法草案第九十四条规定：“中华人民共和国公民有受教育的权利。国家设立并且逐步扩大各种学校和其他文化教育机关，以保证公民享受这种权利。国家特别关怀青年的体力和智力的发展。”这个规定不仅总结和巩固了新中国建国以来人民教育事业的主要成果，而且还进一步地提出了全国教育事业今后要逐步实现的基本任务。
    在旧中国，受教育是富有阶级的特殊权利。虽然，国民党反动派也曾在其“宪法”中规定了所谓“人民有受国民教育之权利与义务”和“国民受教育之机会一律平等”等等冠冕堂皇的条文，但是，由于国民党反动派对于劳动人民进行残酷的剥削和压迫，广大的劳动人民终年过着饥寒交迫的生活，是不可能享受这种权利的。并且，由于国民党反动派的“愚民政策”，教育事业极其衰落。在国民党反动派的国家财政支出中，教育经费只有极小的比重。根据国民党反动派的伪国民大会在一九四六年所通过的“宪法”中规定，教育经费占国家总预算百分之十五，而在实际上，当年教育经费仅占百分之五，一九四七年又降到百分之二。在国民党反动派二十来年的统治时期中，教育经费占国家总预算在百分之一到百分之四的计有十六年之久。就是这点有限的教育经费，不仅常被军费侵占，而且所剩余下来的还要经过层层克扣和贪污浪费，极少真正花费在教育事业上面。因此，许多校舍年久失修，教学设备异常简陋，教师生活得不到保障，学校时开时停，儿童和青年深感失学的苦痛。何况那时所进行的教育是为封建地主阶级、官僚资本家和帝国主义服务的愚民教育，这种教育的结果是对统治阶级有利而对人民有害的。
    在新中国，情形就完全不同了。一方面，广大人民在政治上经济上获得了翻身，从而有可能享受教育的权利；另一方面，人民成为国家的主人，也迫切地需要受教育。在这个基础上，中国共产党和人民政府结合着社会政治改革运动和国民经济的恢复与发展，大力贯彻中国人民政协共同纲领中的文教政策，使得全国教育事业不仅迅速恢复到战前的最高水平，而且获得了很大的发展。
    中国共产党和人民政府对于教育事业的关怀，可由下列的事实说明：一、人民政府拨出大量的教育经费，供应教育事业的恢复和发展的需要。如以一九五○年拨出的社会文教经费为一百，一九五一年为一百七十七点九一，一九五二年为二百九十五点七○，一九五三年则为四百六十点八九。其中一九五三年度国家拨出的教育经费就相当于一九三六年国民党政府的三十倍，一九五四年则相当于三十三倍。二、逐步设立和扩大各种学校和其他文化教育机关。几年以来，人民政府在全国城市和乡村新建小学校二十三万余所，中等学校七百余所，高等学校二十余所（因旧有许多学校在院系调整中合并，故总校数略少于解放前），并建立职工业余学校和农民常年学习的民校数十万所。三、大力培养师资。一九五三年全国高等师范学校在校学生相当于战前最高水平百分之二百五十一；全国中等师范学校在校学生相当于解放前百分之一百五十。四、发给贫苦的工农子弟和青年学生以人民助学金，这种人民助学金是随着学生人数增加而逐年增长的。例如，全国高等师范学校助学金总额如以一九五二年为一百，一九五三年就增至二百二十八，一九五四年又增至二百七十二。这就创造了工农子弟入学的机会（当然，主要的还是由于农民实行土地改革分得了土地，工人工资逐年增长的结果），从而使各级学校工农成份的学生逐年增多。根据不完全的统计，全国高等学校中工农成份学生已由解放初期的百分之十三点八增至一九五三年的百分之二十二左右；一九五三年，全国中等学校工农成份的学生已占百分之四十六（中等技术学校）、五十八（中学）到六十四（师范）；五十八所工农速成中学，已吸收工农干部和产业工人二万八千九百余人；小学校中工农子弟则已占学生总数百分之八十以上。五、各级学校优待国内少数兄弟民族子弟入学，如放宽录取标准、发给较多的助学金、大量供应师资和教材，以及用本民族习惯用的语文进行教学等，使向来文化异常落后的少数兄弟民族子弟有更多的入学机会。一九五三年全国少数兄弟民族子弟入小学的已有二百二十七万余人，入中等学校的有十五万五千余人，入高等学校的有五千五百余人。六、各级学校招收新生时都是男女兼收，并注意说服家长尽量送女孩子入学。解放以来，各级学校女生的比重是在逐年增长着的，例如解放前（一九四五年）全国小学校女生占学生总数百分之二十五点五二，解放后一九五二年就上升到百分之三十点一八；高等学校女生也由解放前（一九四七年）的百分之十七点八，上升到一九五三年的百分之二十五点二八。
    正因为人民政府采取了上述一系列的措施，所以全国学校教育事业有了很大的发展。一九五三年全国小学学生约有五千余万人，比国民党统治时期最高水平增加了一点三倍；中等学校学生三百六十二万余人，相当于解放前最高水平的百分之一百九十三；高等学校在校学生二十一万二千余人，相当于解放前最高水平百分之一百七十以上。此外，一九五二年全国农民参加冬学学习的约有二千九百余万人，一九五三年参加厂矿职工业余学校学习的约有二百五十八万人，农民参加常年民校的约有一千二百余万人。这也就是说，目前全国人民已有十分之一以上参加了各级学校和业余补习学校的学习，这是中国历史上空前未有的现象。
    宪法草案第九十四条不仅巩固了我国建国以来教育事业的成绩，而且还提出：“国家设立并且逐步扩大各种学校和其他文化教育机关，以保证公民享受这种权利。”这就是全国教育事业今后的基本任务。宪法草案规定的这个任务，是完全有可能逐步实现的。目前，人民政府已经和将要采取下列措施：首先，依照着在发展生产的基础上来逐步提高人民的物质生活和文化生活水平的原则，根据国家逐年增加的教育经费和师资培养、校舍修建、教材及教学设备供应的可能，来逐步地扩大各种学校和其他文化教育机关。而要使各种学校得到更大的发展以及各地人民更充分地享到受教育的权利，就要注意学校网的合理分配。因此，人民政府已对此进行统盘的规定。今后，中学、小学的学校网的分布将要根据下列的原则：一、适当地考虑人口的分布、密度以及地理条件（如山地与平原有所不同）；二、在国家财力与人力有限的条件下，尽先照顾工矿地区职工子弟入学的要求；三、适当地照顾少数兄弟民族的特殊的情况和不同的要求。高等学校和中等专业学校网的分布，则根据学校的性质来区别。例如，高等和中等工业学校与性质相近的工业基地结合在一起，以便厂矿工程技术人员的兼课、学校就近利用厂矿原有机器设备进行生产实习和科学研究工作；医科学校设立在大中城市中心，并与附属医院设在一起；综合大学与科学研究机关结合在一起；农林学校根据农业、林业生产经济区划来确定；高等和中等师范学校则根据人口的分布、密度以及今后普通中、小学教育发展的要求来决定。此外，为了满足国家对于各种建设人才的迫切需要，高等教育和中等专业教育也将有更大的发展。
    其次，根据国家在过渡时期的总任务和第一个五年国民经济建设计划的基本任务，正在拟订第一个五年教育事业建设计划。这个计划首先是要保证做到为国家各种建设，特别是工业建设而相应地培养建设人才；其次是要根据在发展生产的基础上适当地来改善人民物质生活与文化生活的原则，适当地发展中学、小学教育，逐步地满足劳动人民，特别是工矿地区职工子弟入学的要求。为此，就要大力培养各级学校的师资，全国高等师范教育将有很大的发展，连同综合大学毕业生到中学担负教师的人数，到一九五七年全国中等学校的师资比之现在教师总数预计将要增加一倍左右。全国小学教育除了继续补充数十万新的师资以外，还要逐步提高现有
  一百四、五十万小学教师的政治文化水平和业务能力。这是提高教学质量的决定步骤，也是进一步保证公民享受到教育权利的关键。
    再次，对于工农子弟、少数兄弟民族、华侨子弟以及妇女的入学，将继续给予必要的帮助和照顾。过去人民政府已经在这方面积累了不少的经验，今后仍将要在巩固过去已有成绩的基础上作进一步的努力。
    最后，人民政府将要继续拨出巨额教育经费来修建校舍和补充教学设备，从物质上来保证公民享受教育的权利。不久的将来，不仅要新建许多学校，而且还要扩充许多原有学校的校舍。例如，北京清华大学的校舍预计将要扩充一倍多，教学设备将要增加五、六倍。不少普通中学和中等专业学校的校舍将比现有的扩充一倍左右。有些初级小学也将要增建高小班所需的校舍。并且，由于有计划地推行二部制，原有的校舍和教学设备就将发挥更大的作用，从而将使更多的公民获得受教育的权利。
    无疑地，随着国家经济力量的不断增长，公民的受教育的权利必将得到更大的扩充。
    旧中国的青年和他们的前辈过着同样的饥寒交迫的生活，他们不仅是体力的发展受到了限制，就是智力的发展也受到不良的影响。解放后，中国共产党和人民政府对青年的体力和智力的发展给予特别的关怀。例如，一九五一年，中央人民政府政务院颁发关于改善各级学校学生健康状况的决定，决定的基本精神，就是从减轻学生负担、改善学生伙食和加强文娱活动、体格锻炼等方面，使青年学生的体力和智力得到全面的发展。一九五二年，政务院对于中等以上学校发给人民助学金又作了统一的规定：发给全体高等学校和中等专业学校（包括师范）的学生以人民助学金，除了全部免除了学生的伙食费用外，还解决了贫苦的学生部分的衣着和零用的困难；发给普通中学部分的学生以助学金，这就使家庭贫苦的学生得到必要的补助。人民政府一九五四年花费的助学金总额相当于国民党反动政府一九三六年全国教育经费的四倍。一九五三年，毛泽东同志又向全国青年发出“身体好、学习好、工作好”的指示，使各级学校更加重视青年的体力和智力的发展。现在，宪法草案第九十四条又明确规定：
  “国家特别关怀青年的体力和智力的发展。”完全可以相信，随着国家经济建设的发展，新中国的青年必将过着更幸福的生活。
    为什么中国共产党和人民政府要这样特别地关怀青年的体力和智力的发展呢？原因就在于：只有使青年的体力和智力获得全面的发展，才能为国家培养成真正健全的公民。这就是说，要把我们的祖国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义国家，就需要既有一定的文化科学知识水平，又有强健的体质的公民，来参加建设工作，来保卫祖国的安全。
    毛泽东同志曾在中国人民政协第一届全体会议上的开幕词中预言：“随着经济建设的高潮的到来，不可避免地将要出现一个文化建设的高潮。中国人被人认为不文明的时代已经过去了，我们将以
  一个具有高度文化的民族出现于世界。”而宪法草案第九十四条就是这个预言实现的一个证明，也就是今后继续实现这个预言所要努力的方向。
