    Overcome Waterlogging Disasters and Strive for a Bumper Rice Harvest
    Shen Yuqing
    Rice is China's most important food crop, accounting for 22 percent of the total area of ​​food crops and 42 percent of total grain output. Of this, the commodity volume reaches 52 percent of the total grain commodity volume. Therefore, overcoming the current waterlogging disasters and completing this year's rice production increase plan is of great significance for meeting the ever-increasing needs of national economic construction and people's lives for grain.
    This year, all regions have strengthened their leadership over rice production, and the quality of rice sowing has improved significantly compared with previous years. In particular, the technological reforms promoted to increase the unit area yield of rice have been more successful than in any previous year. According to incomplete statistics from Sichuan, Guizhou, Hunan, and Zhejiang provinces alone, more than 72 million mu have adopted appropriate close planting of rice. In Jianyang and other five special districts in Fujian Province, more than 70 percent of farmers have implemented salt water or muddy water seed selection to cultivate strong seedlings. Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Guangxi, Sichuan and other provinces have expanded the area of ​​double-cropping rice fields. At present, rice is generally growing well in most areas, and many areas have begun to harvest early rice, while middle rice has begun to flower, and late rice has begun to tiller. The early rice of agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups in Liling County, Hunan Province, can increase production by 10 percent compared with last year. In areas of Jiangxi that have not been affected by waterlogging disasters, rice is also growing well, and production can generally increase by more than 7 percent. All of these have laid a favorable foundation for the successful completion of this year's rice production increase plan.
    However, since mid-April, many rice-producing areas, especially the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, have experienced continuous heavy rains. Due to the large amount of rainfall, the rapid onset, and the long duration, the rivers could not discharge the water in time, and the low-lying areas along the rivers and lakes in Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, and other provinces suffered from waterlogging disasters. Some early and mid-season rice seedlings were submerged and washed away, and late rice could not be transplanted in time. At the same time, it is currently the flood season, and these areas are still suffering from serious flood threats. This has added great difficulty to current rice production.
    The central issue in rice-producing areas at present is that, on the one hand, we must concentrate our efforts in disaster-stricken areas to overcome waterlogging disasters, strengthen flood prevention and rescue work, prevent the area of ​​waterlogging disasters from expanding further, and at the same time do a good job in drainage and rescue work, minimizing the disaster area as much as possible, rescuing whatever can be rescued, replanting a season of late rice in a timely manner, and planting other crops if it is too late to replant late rice, striving to plant more and harvest more. On the other hand, we must strengthen production leadership in general areas, that is, non-disaster areas, and strive to overfulfill the production increase plan in these areas. Only in this way can we ensure the completion of this year's rice production increase plan.
    At present, in flood prevention, rescue and drainage operations in disaster-stricken areas, most cadres and the masses of people have shown an unusually tenacious fighting spirit. As a result, although floods have reached or exceeded the highest water levels in previous years in many areas, no major problems have occurred, and the disaster area has been greatly reduced. However, it cannot be denied that some cadres and the masses have developed pessimistic and disappointed emotions in the face of severe waterlogging disasters, lacking confidence in overcoming waterlogging disasters and engaging in production for self-relief. This is a major obstacle currently hindering the overcoming of waterlogging disasters. Facts have proved that as long as we can establish a tenacious fighting will and give full play to the collective strength and wisdom of the broad masses, we can overcome difficulties and avoid or reduce disasters. Lixian County in Hunan Province is a relatively severely affected area, with accumulated water depths generally ranging from two or three feet to five or six feet. The fields and lakes are connected, forming a vast expanse of water. However, due to the conscientious efforts of all the cadres and the masses in the area, many effective methods for preventing waterlogging and draining stagnant water have been created. From June 19th to 21st, in two days and two nights, they drained stagnant water from 102,000 mu of paddy fields. Zhu Jia Township in Kunshan County, Jiangsu Province, has experienced continuous cloudy and rainy weather in recent months, resulting in internal waterlogging. The land was drained and then flooded again several times. On June 13th, heavy rain continued, and some rice fields were flooded again. However, because the township's Party branch inspired the masses to recall the process of overcoming the flood in 1949, the confidence of the cadres and the masses in overcoming the flood was greatly enhanced. The entire township mobilized 300 waterwheels, and as a result, all the rice fields were quickly rescued. There are such examples everywhere.
    In flood prevention, rescue and drainage operations, we must rely on mutual aid and cooperative organizations to give full play to the power of organized efforts to overcome disasters. When Guangfu Township in Changde County, Hunan Province, began draining stagnant water, people's hearts were not united, and the strength was dispersed, so progress was very slow. Later, with mutual aid and cooperative organizations as the core, 140 small teams and 8 medium teams were organized, and 9 "baby-holding groups" were organized to mobilize women to participate in drainage. In less than ten days, all 5,700 mu of stagnant water fields in the township were drained. In some areas, flood prevention and drainage work is not reliant on mutual aid and cooperative organizations, not only cannot flood prevention and drainage work be done well, but most agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups have collapsed. This approach is obviously wrong and must be quickly corrected.
    In some non-disaster areas, due to abundant rainfall, the seedlings are growing well, and a widespread blind optimism and the idea of ​​waiting for the harvest has emerged, which is very harmful. In these areas, we should further implement technical reforms, strengthen field management, and strive for a bumper harvest. At present, early rice has begun to be harvested, and farmers must be educated to improve harvesting methods, so as to achieve careful harvesting and careful threshing, returning every grain to the household. Middle rice has reached the late stage of growth. This year there has been more rain, and the rice plants are growing more luxuriantly. Dry the rice fields at the right time to avoid possible lodging and incomplete grain filling. Areas with the conditions can promote the cultivation of regenerated rice after harvesting early and mid-season rice. Single-season late rice is still in the early stages of growth, and most double-cropping rice has not yet been transplanted, so there are even more sufficient conditions to strive for a bumper harvest. Therefore, we must further promote technical measures such as appropriate close planting and increased fertilization. Some double-cropping rice areas have a bias toward emphasizing early rice and neglecting late rice, with the so-called saying that "late rice does not need fertilizer, it all depends on the autumn rain." This view must be overcome, and we must strive to achieve bumper harvests in both seasons.
    Although there has been a lot of rain in various places this year, we still cannot relax our vigilance against drought. It is a common natural law that floods are followed by droughts. At present, many small-scale water conservancy projects in disaster areas have been destroyed by floods and must be repaired in a timely manner. Jian County, Jiangxi Province, seized the gap in agricultural work to mobilize the masses to repair 672 water conservancy projects that were destroyed by floods, accounting for 98 percent of those that should be repaired. In the fifth district of Jinxian County, 13 water conservancy projects were destroyed by floods and were all repaired within a week. This approach is worth learning from in various places. In non-disaster areas, we should also make full use of the current favorable conditions of abundant rainfall to do a good job in water storage and drought prevention to ensure that middle and late rice fields do not lack water. Serious insect pests may also occur in rice areas this year. The Yancheng Special District Farm in Jiangsu Province collected seven times more rice stem borers in May this year than in the same period last year. All rice-producing areas must strengthen the forecasting and prediction of diseases and insect pests, make full preparations, and carry out prevention and control in a timely manner to ensure a bumper rice harvest.

    战胜水涝灾害争取水稻丰收
    沈煜清
    水稻是我国最重要的粮食作物，种植面积占粮食作物总面积的百分之二十二，产量为粮食总产量的百分之四十二，其中商品量达到粮食商品总量的百分之五十二。因此，克服目前的水涝灾害，完成今年的水稻增产计划，对于满足国家经济建设和人民生活对粮食日益增长的需要具有十分重要的意义。
    今年各地都加强了对水稻生产的领导，水稻的播种质量较往年有显著提高，特别是为提高水稻单位面积产量所推行的技术改革比以往任何一年都更有成绩。仅据四川、贵州、湖南、浙江四省不完全统计，推行水稻适当密植的有七千二百多万亩；福建省建阳等五个专区实行盐水或泥水选种，培育壮秧的有百分之七十以上的农户；湖南、江西、安徽、广西、四川等省都扩大了双季稻田的面积。目前一般地区的水稻都生长良好，许多地区已开始收割早稻，中稻已开始扬花，晚稻已分蘖。湖南省醴陵县农业生产合作社、互助组的早稻，比去年可增产百分之十。江西没有受水涝灾害的地区，水稻生长也很好，一般可增产百分之七以上。所有这些都为胜利完成今年的水稻增产计划打下了有利的基础。
    但是，四月中旬以来，许多水稻产区，特别是长江中下游一带，连降暴雨。由于雨量大，来势猛，时间长，江河泄水不及，湖北、湖南、江西、安徽等省沿江沿湖的低洼地区，遭到了水涝灾害。部分早中稻禾苗被水淹没冲毁，晚稻不能及时插秧。同时目前正是伏汛时期，这些地区仍然遭受着严重的洪水威胁。这就给目前的水稻生产增加了很大的困难。
    目前水稻产区的中心问题是：一方面必须在遭受灾害的地区集中力量战胜水涝灾害，加强防汛抢险工作，使水涝灾害面积不再扩大，同时作好排水抢救工作，尽量使灾害面积缩小，作到能够抢救的都抢救出来，适时地补种一季晚稻，赶不上补种晚稻的也种上其他作物，争取多种多收。另一面必须加强对一般地区即非灾区的生产领导，争取在这些地区超额完成增产计划。只有这样，才能够保证完成今年的水稻增产计划。
    目前受灾地区在防汛抢险和排水抢救工作中，大部分干部和农民群众都表现了异常顽强的斗争精神，因而许多地区虽然洪水达到了或者超过了历年的最高水位，也并没有发生大问题，同时灾害面积也大大缩小了。但是不能否认，有部分干部和群众在严重的水涝灾害面前产生了悲观失望情绪，缺乏战胜水涝灾害和生产自救的信心，这是目前阻碍战胜水涝灾害的一个主要障碍。事实证明，只要我们能够树立顽强的斗争意志，发挥广大群众的集体力量和智慧，就能战胜困难，避免灾害或者减轻灾害。湖南省澧县是遭灾比较严重的地区，积水深度一般二、三尺到五、六尺，田湖相连，汪洋一片，但由于当地全体干部和群众的认真努力，创造了许多防涝排渍的有效办法，在六月十九日到二十一日两天两夜就排出了渍水田十万零二千亩。江苏省昆山县朱家乡近月连续阴雨，发生内涝，排而复淹有好几次，六月十三日续降大雨，又有部分稻田被淹，但由于该乡党支部启发群众回忆一九四九年战胜水灾的经过，干部、群众战胜水灾的信心大大提高，全乡出动三百部水车，结果很快就抢救出了全部稻田。这样的例子各地都有。
    在防汛抢险和排水抢救工作中，必须依靠互助合作组织，充分发挥组织起来战胜灾害的力量。湖南省常德县光复乡，排渍开始时，人心不齐，力量分散，进度很慢。后来以互助合作组织为核心，组织一百四十个小队，八个中队，并组织九个抱娃娃组，发动妇女参加排水，不到十天，便把全乡五千七百亩渍水田全部排出。有些地区在防汛排涝工作中不依靠互助合作组织，不但防汛排涝工作不能做好，而且大部农业生产合作社、互助组都垮了台。这种作法显然是错误的，必须迅速纠正。
    在某些非灾地区，由于雨水充沛，禾苗生长较好，普遍产生了盲目乐观，坐待收获的思想，这是非常有害的。在这些地区应进一步贯彻技术改革，加强田间管理，争取丰收。目前早稻已开始收割，必须教育农民改进收割方法，做到细收细打，颗粒还家。中稻已到生长后期，今年雨水较多，稻株生长较茂，应适时落干晒田，避免可能发生倒伏和稻粒不饱满的现象。有条件的地区，早、中稻收割后，可提倡培育再生稻。单季晚稻目前尚在生长初期，双季稻大部还未插秧，更有充分条件争取丰收，因此，必须进一步大力推行适当密植，增施肥料等技术措施。部分双季稻地区，有重早稻轻晚稻的偏向，有所谓“晚稻不上粪，全靠秋雨喷”的说法，这种观点，必须克服，要争取做到两熟丰收。
    今年各地雨水虽多，但仍不能放松对干旱的警惕，先涝后旱是常常出现的自然规律。目前灾区有不少小型水利，已被洪水冲毁，必须及时加以修复。江西省吉安县抓紧农事空隙，发动群众修复了被洪水冲坏的水利工程六百七十二处，占应修复的百分之九十八。进贤县第五区被洪水冲毁水利工程十三处，一星期内，就全部修复。这种作法值得各地学习。在非灾地区也应充分利用当前雨水充沛的有利条件，做好蓄水防旱工作，保证中、晚稻田不缺水。今年水稻地区，还可能发生严重的虫害。江苏盐城专区农场今年五月份诱集螟蛾，比去年同期增多七倍。各水稻产区必须加强对病虫的预报预测工作，充分作好准备，及时进行防治，保证水稻丰收。
