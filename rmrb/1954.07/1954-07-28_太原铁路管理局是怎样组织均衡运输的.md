The Taiyuan Railway Administration overfulfilled the state transportation plan in 1953, and the utilization efficiency of locomotives and rolling stock also improved. However, the overall transportation situation was relaxed in the first half of the year and tight in the second, very uneven. The difference between the highest and lowest monthly transport volume for the year reached 38.4%, and in some areas, it even exceeded 100%. The unevenness of transportation was due, on the one hand, to the unbalanced production of some factories and mines, resulting in a disconnect between production and sales. On the other hand, the railway department was not familiar with the sources of goods and did not improve the organization of freight collection in a timely manner. This resulted in fewer goods and more vehicles in the first half of the year, completing only 44.8% of the annual transportation task, and the transportation capacity was not fully utilized, resulting in waste. In the second half of the year, especially in the fourth quarter, the transport volume increased sharply, and transportation became excessively tense and busy. In December alone, about 15% of the materials were restricted by transportation capacity and could not be transported in time. The unevenness in transportation not only wastes the national transportation capacity but also deepens the contradiction between the rising transportation demand and transportation capacity.

In 1954, with the development of industrial construction in the Taiyuan area, the transportation tasks of the Taiyuan Railway Administration increased by 26.2% compared with 1953. Especially with the increase in transport volume through weak link lines, the tasks of the Taiyuan Railway Administration became even more arduous. If this year's transport volume fluctuates as it did last year, many materials will not be able to be transported. The Taiyuan Railway Administration immediately began to vigorously organize balanced transportation to unleash the potential of existing railways and overcome the contradiction of transportation capacity lagging behind the rising transport volume.

From its work in 1953, the Taiyuan Railway Administration clearly understood the importance of freight flow and organizing balanced transportation for railway transportation work. At the same time, the planned management of factories and mines along the line was also gradually strengthened, which helped to gradually increase the proportion of railway planned transportation, which is conducive to organizing balanced transportation. The Taiyuan Railway Administration took three specific measures in organizing balanced transportation: First, before and after the preparation of the 1954 annual transportation plan, it conducted two more in-depth economic surveys. In the first half of this year, it also verified the sources of goods for three major commodities: coal, coke, and mineral building materials, thus grasping the situation of about 90% of the total freight volume; second, in accordance with the instructions of the Ministry of Railways on the work of 1954 and the specific requirements of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Shanxi Finance Committee on ensuring that 52% of the annual transportation plan is completed in the first half of the year, the balanced arrangement of the annual cargo transportation was carefully considered. Under the leadership of the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Finance Committee, three balanced transportation meetings were held, resolutions were made on the annual balanced transportation of major commodities, and annual balanced transportation contracts were successively signed with relevant departments; third, the daily transportation organization work was strengthened, emphasis was placed on strengthening night operations to strive for balanced all-day operations, and according to the situation that the bureau's empty cars rely on the supply of other bureaus, the law of empty car supply was analyzed, and specific methods were formulated to achieve basic monthly balance, so as to resolutely complete the monthly plan and eliminate the possibility of transportation fluctuations caused by backlog or arrears due to more goods and fewer vehicles.

After taking these measures, the bureau has made preliminary achievements in organizing balanced transportation. The transport volume has increased month by month since February, and the transportation tasks for each month have been overfulfilled. The situation of insufficient freight volume in the second and third quarters in the past has been changed, and the materials shipped out in the first half of the year reached more than 53% of the annual transportation plan; the proportion of planned transportation has been increased to more than 94%.

The experience of the Taiyuan Railway Administration in organizing balanced transportation proves that the local Party and Finance Committee's overall consideration and unified arrangement of the region's production, transportation, and sales work is a prerequisite for organizing balanced transportation and thus ensuring the completion of the national transportation plan. As early as the beginning of December 1953, the Shanxi Provincial Finance Committee convened a meeting on the annual balanced transportation of coal, coke, and mineral building materials for 1954, and in January of this year, it issued instructions on the balanced transportation of materials throughout the year, clearly stipulating that the coal and coke transport volume in the first quarter should not be lower than the level of the fourth quarter of 1953; the transportation of mineral building materials should start from the first quarter and basically end at the end of the third quarter; for materials with fixed production equipment and long-term production, it is generally necessary to achieve annual, quarterly, and monthly balanced consignment; other fixed production of gypsum, limestone, etc., should be transported more in the off-season and less in the peak season as much as possible. And each consignment department and the railway were responsible for signing a balanced transportation contract. Specific guidance was also given for the signing of all contracts. In some cases, in order to ensure the seriousness of the contract and the thorough realization in the execution, the Shanxi Provincial Finance Committee also personally acted as the supervisor of the contract and properly solved the specific problems of individual mining areas.

In order to further strengthen the working relationship between the production, transportation, and sales departments, the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, based on the suggestion of the Taiyuan Railway Administration, instructed the relevant Party committees to assist in the establishment of joint offices of production, transportation, and sales departments in Xincheng, Kouquan, and Yangquan, thus powerfully helping the completion of the transportation plan. Because the Taiyuan Railway Administration insisted on the system of requesting instructions from and reporting to the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China on a monthly basis, and jointly implemented the instructions of the Party and Finance Committee with the consignment departments, it solved many problems related to transportation work and laid the foundation for the balanced completion of the national transportation tasks.

Obtaining strong support from the consignment departments is an important key to organizing balanced transportation. Departments such as the Datong Mining Bureau have given strong support to the railway department from the beginning of discussing the balanced transportation contract this year. In discussing the specific clauses of the contract, the spirit of starting from the overall situation and jointly completing the national transportation tasks was also implemented. For example, the Majiliang Coal Mine of the Datong Mining Bureau increased the annual export task by tens of thousands of tons in May, which needs to be transported by railway. Considering the difficulty of transportation work in the peak season, the mine stipulated in the contract that all the transport volume should be completed in advance from May to October. When signing the annual grain balanced transportation contract with the Grain Department of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in the second quarter of this year, the grain department appropriately reduced the transport volume in the fourth quarter based on the fact that the fourth quarter of this year and the first quarter of next year belong to the same agricultural year. The railway department also considered the characteristics of grain production and purchase, so that the contract was successfully signed.

Organizing balanced transportation must be based on a more detailed understanding of the sources of goods. Only by understanding the sending areas, production seasons, and production and marketing departments of materials can the transportation seasons be arranged separately according to objective needs and the monthly transport volume be adjusted. In investigating and understanding the sources of goods, the Taiyuan Railway Administration adopted a graded responsibility system of the Administration, Branch Bureau, and Station; according to the characteristics that there are a large number of concentrated sources of goods (coal accounts for more than 70%) in the jurisdiction, and there are many scattered sources of goods along the southern section of the Datong-Puzhou Railway and the Beijing-Baotou Railway, different economic regions were divided, and in-depth investigations were conducted in groups to introduce the situation of transportation work, obtain the support of the consignment departments, and strengthen the working relationship between the two parties.

However, merely based on the information on the sources of goods and proposing to the consignment departments to discuss and sign a balanced transportation contract, it often cannot be immediately accepted by all consignment departments. Some units believe that the materials to be transported by their departments are the main national materials, "Whether or not to propose a plan, whether to propose it early or late, the railway must transport them anyway." Some units also overemphasize trivial issues, affecting the signing of the contract, which requires serious systematic explanation work.

Different measures must be taken for different materials and different periods: In the winter of 1953, when the balanced transportation of coal was first organized, the planning year had not yet begun, and the annual coal production plan was being prepared. In this case, it was obviously impossible to immediately sign an annual balanced transportation contract. However, to organize balanced transportation, it must start from the first quarter, otherwise, it will cause waste of transportation capacity. Therefore, based on the spirit that the production in the first quarter of this year should not be lower than the level of the fourth quarter of last year, under the specific auspices of the Provincial Finance Committee, the form of stipulating the minimum balanced transport volume of each mine was adopted as a resolution of the meeting, and both parties jointly observed and implemented it. In the second quarter of this year, the annual plans of various departments have been determined, and the method of signing an annual quarterly, and even monthly, balanced transportation contract has been adopted to further consolidate. For mineral building materials with many consignment departments and many sending stations, the method of convening meetings and resolving to transport them within a certain period is adopted; other materials such as cement, limestone, and gypsum are respectively based on the fact that their transport volume is generally not large, or because production and transportation have been relatively balanced over the years, only the policy of paying attention to urging and striving to transport more in advance is adopted; for some materials, when organizing balanced transportation, it is necessary to solve the problems of their horse-drawn transport at the same time, and it is necessary to adopt the method of signing multi-party (such as production, sales, railway, and transport departments) contact contracts.

    太原铁路管理局是怎样组织均衡运输的
    中央铁道部运输计划处
    太原铁路管理局一九五三年超额完成了国家运输计划，机车车辆的运用效率也有所提高。但运输工作总的情况是前松后紧，很不均衡。全年最高月份与最低月份之运量相差达百分之三十八点四，个别地区甚至相差一倍以上。运输不均衡的原因一方面是有些厂矿生产尚不均衡，产销脱节；另一方面是铁路部门不熟悉货源情况，没有及时改进组织货源工作。这就造成上半年货少车多，仅完成全年运输任务的百分之四十四点八，运输能力没有充分利用，形成浪费；而下半年，特别是第四季度，运量骤增，运输过份紧张和繁忙，仅十二月份即有百分之十五左右的物资受到运输能力限制，不能及时运送。运输上的不均衡，不仅浪费着国家运输能力，而且加深了由于运量上涨所形成的运输要求和运输能力间的矛盾。
    一九五四年随着太原地区工业建设的发展，太原铁路管理局的运输任务较一九五三年增加了百分之二十六点二，特别是经过薄弱环节线路的运量增加，太原铁路管理局的任务更加艰巨。今年的运量如果仍像去年一样波动，将使许多物资输送不出去。太原铁路管理局即着手大力组织均衡运输，发挥现有铁路的潜在力量，来克服运输能力落后于运量上涨的矛盾。
    太原铁路管理局从一九五三年工作中，明确了解货源货流、组织均衡运输对铁路运输工作的重要性，与此同时沿线厂矿的计划管理也在逐步加强，这就助成了铁路计划运输比重之逐见提高，有利于组织均衡运输。太原铁路管理局在组织均衡运输中采取了三项具体措施：第一、在编制一九五四年年度运输计划前后，进行了两次较为深入的经济调查，今年上半年又对煤焦、矿物性建筑材料、粮食三种大宗物资进行了货源核对，因而掌握了全局运量百分之九十左右的货源情况；第二、遵照铁道部关于一九五四年工作的指示和中共山西省委、山西财委关于保证上半年完成全年运输计划百分之五十二的具体要求，认真考虑了全年货物运输的均衡安排。在省委和省财委的领导下，召开了三次均衡运输会议，作出了大宗物资的全年均衡运输的决议，并相继和有关部门订立全年均衡运输合同；第三、加强日常的运输组织工作，强调加强夜间作业，争取全日均衡，并根据该局空车依靠外局供应的情况，分析了空车供应的规律，订出具体办法，以达全月基本均衡，从而坚决完成月间计划，消灭在货多车少的情况下积压待运或欠运而引起运输波动的可能性。
    采取了这些措施后，该局在组织均衡运输工作上，已取得了初步成绩。二月份后的运量逐月增加，各月运输任务均已超额完成。改变了以往二、三季度货源不足的情况，上半年运出的物资，达到全年运输计划的百分之五十三以上；计划运输的比重，已提高到百分之九十四以上。
    太原铁路管理局组织均衡运输的经验证明，当地党和财委通盘考虑和统一安排全区的产运销工作，是组织均衡运输从而保证完成国家运输计划的先决条件。山西省财委早于一九五三年十二月初，即召开了一九五四年煤焦、矿物性建筑材料全年均衡运输会议，今年一月复发出了关于全年物资均衡运输的指示，明确规定第一季煤焦运量不得低于一九五三年第四季水平；矿物性建筑材料的运输，应自第一季度开始，第三季末基本结束；有固定生产设备长期生产之物资，一般要作到年、季、月均衡托运；其他固定生产之石膏、石灰石等，则应尽量做到淡月多运，旺月少运的原则。并责成各托运部门和铁路签定均衡运输合同。对所有合同的签订，又给了具体指导。在有些情况下，为了合同的严肃及为执行中之彻底实现，山西省财委还亲自作合同的监督人，对个别矿区的具体问题，也作妥善解决。
    为了进一步密切产运销各部门的工作联系，中共山西省委根据太原铁路管理局的建议，责成有关党委协助组成了新城、口泉、阳泉三地的产运销部门联合办公室，因而有力地帮助了运输计划的完成。由于太原铁路管理局坚持了逐月向中共山西省委请示和报告的制度，并和各托运部门共同贯彻了党和财委的指示，解决了有关运输工作的许多问题，为均衡地完成国家运输任务奠定了基础。
    取得各托运部门的大力支持，是组织均衡运输的重要关键。大同矿务局等部门，今年从开始商订均衡运输合同起，即给铁路部门以有力的支持。在讨论合同的具体条文中，也贯彻了从全局出发共同完成国家运输任务的精神。如大同矿务局马脊梁煤矿，五月份增加了全年数万吨的外销任务，需要通过铁路来运输，矿方考虑了旺季运输工作上的困难，在合同上规定将全部运量提前在五月至十月运完。今年第二季度与内蒙古自治区粮食部签订全年粮食均衡运输合同时，粮食部门根据今年第四季与明年第一季同属一个农业年度的情况，适当减缩了第四季运量，铁路部门也考虑了粮食的生产和收购等特点，使合同顺利地签定下来。
    组织均衡运输，必须建立在较为详尽的摸清货源的基础上，唯有了解了物资之发送地区、生产季节及其生产和供销部门后，才能根据客观需要分别排定运输季节，调济月间运量。太原铁路管理局在调查了解货源中，采取了管理局、分局、车站分级负责制度；根据管内存在着大量集中货源（煤炭占百分之七十以上），而同蒲铁路南段和京包铁路沿线又有不少零星分散货源的特点，划分了不同的经济地区，分组进行深入摸底，介绍运输工作的情况，取得托运部门的支持，密切双方工作关系。
    但仅仅根据掌握的货源情况，向托运部门提出商订均衡运输合同，常不能立即为所有托运部门所接受。有些单位认为本部门要运输的物资是国家主要物资，“提计划与不提计划，提得早与晚，反正铁路都得给运”。也有些单位过分强调枝节问题，影响合同的签订，这就需要认真的进行系统的解释工作。
    对不同物资，不同时期，必须采取不同的措施：一九五三年冬，初次组织煤炭均衡运输时，计划年度尚未开始，全年煤炭生产计划正在编制中，在此种情况下要求立即签定全年均衡运输合同，显然是不可能的。但是要组织均衡运输又必须从第一季开始，否则又将造成运输力的浪费。因而即基于今年第一季生产不低于去年第四季水平的精神，在省财委的具体主持下，采取规定各矿起码均衡运量，作为会议决议的形式，双方共同遵守执行。今年第二季度各部门年度计划已经确定，则采取了签订全年分季，甚而分月的均衡运输合同的方式来进
  一步巩固。对托运部门多、发站多的矿物性建筑材料，则采取召集会议，决议在一定时期内运完的办法；其他如水泥、石灰石、石膏等分别根据其运量
  一般都不大，或因历年生产和运输均较均衡，则仅采取经常注意督促，争取提前多运的方针；对有些物资于组织均衡运输时，必须同时解决其马车搬运者，则又须采取签订多方面（如产、销、铁路和搬运等部门）联系合同的方式。
