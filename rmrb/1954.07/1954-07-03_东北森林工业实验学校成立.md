    Northeast Forest Industry Experimental School Established
    The Northeast Forest Industry Experimental School has been established in Dailing Town, Songjiang Province.
    In recent years, the Northeast forest industry has developed rapidly, requiring a corresponding increase in the management level of grassroots organizations. To this end, the Northeast Forest Industry Administration established the Northeast Forest Industry Experimental School in Dailing Town, Yichun County, Songjiang Province, this year. The plan is to first train more than 2,000 existing grassroots leading cadres and planning management cadres in the Northeast forest industry sector in stages over two years. These include timber yard managers (workshop directors), forest management office directors, lumber mill managers, work planners, production dispatchers, general party branch secretaries, branch secretaries, and trade union cadres.
    The Northeast Forest Industry Experimental School officially opened on May 1 this year. The first phase included four forest harvesting and transportation classes, one forest railway class, one lumbering class, one work planning class, and one cadre cultural learning class, with a total of more than 840 students.
    The Northeast Forest Industry Experimental School has excellent teaching conditions in Dailing Town. The original Dailing Forest Industry Experimental Bureau has been completely converted into an experimental institution serving teaching. The Northeast forest industry system will test new machinery and tools and promote advanced experiments here.

    东北森林工业实验学校成立
    东北森林工业实验学校已在松江省带岭镇成立。
    几年来，东北森林工业飞跃地发展，要求基层机构的管理水平相应地提高。为此，东北森林工业管理局今年在松江省伊春县带岭镇创办了东北森林工业实验学校，计划在两年内首先把东北森林工业部门现有两千余名伐木场长（车间主任）、森林管理处主任、制材厂长、作业计划员、生产调度员、党团总支书记、支部书记、工会干部等基层领导干部和计划管理干部分期轮训一次。
    东北森林工业实验学校在今年五月一日正式开学，第一期开办了四个森林采伐运输班，一个森林铁路班，一个制材班，一个作业计划班，另外还有一个干部文化学习班，学员共八百四十多名。
    东北森林工业实验学校在带岭镇有着很好的教学条件。原带岭森林工业实验局完全改为为教学服务的实验性质的机构。东北森林工业系统将在这里试用新的机械、工具和推广先进实验。
