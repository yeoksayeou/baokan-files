Xinhua News Agency, Moscow: The Fourth Congress of Soviet Consumer Cooperatives opened in Moscow on June 29th, according to TASS. The conference was attended by representatives of thirty-three million members. Soviet Deputy Prime Ministers Mikoyan and Kosygin, and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Russian Federation Puzanov, participated in the meeting. Representatives of cooperative movements from fifteen countries also attended the meeting.

The congratulatory message from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet Council of Ministers to the Congress was read at the meeting. (Full text will be published separately)

Khokhlov, Chairman of the Board of the Central Union of Consumer Societies of the USSR, delivered a report at the meeting. He pointed out that the working policy of consumer cooperatives is to maximize the satisfaction of the growing needs of rural residents for consumer goods. In the six years since the closing of the Third Congress of Consumer Cooperatives, tens of thousands of new stores and warehouses have been opened in rural areas. There are now more than 300,000 cooperative trading enterprises in rural areas of the Soviet Union. Last year, the turnover of cooperative goods almost tripled that of 1948. The sales of silk fabrics, woolen fabrics, sewing products and shoes in rural areas increased by an average of three and a half times that of 1948; the sales of bricks, lime, window glass, slate and tiles were eleven times that of 1948. Rural residents purchased many times more furniture, radios and musical instruments than in previous years, and purchased tens of thousands of trucks and cars.

The Congress also heard the report of the Inspection Committee of the Central Union of Consumer Societies of the USSR. The meeting has begun to discuss the above two reports.

Meetings continued on June 30th and July 1st to discuss the report of the Board of the Central Union of Consumer Societies of the USSR.

Representatives speaking at the meeting talked about the development of rural trade in the Soviet Union and the rapid increase in the purchasing power of rural residents. For example, in the six years since the closing of the Third Congress of Consumer Cooperatives of the Soviet Union, the sales volume of major consumer goods in Belarus has increased two to three times. The republic now has more than 10,000 rural stores, and at least 2,000 new trading institutions will be opened in the next two years. The Buryat-Mongol Autonomous Republic did not have a single rural store forty years ago, but now it has opened hundreds of department stores, specialty stores and other stores in rural areas. In the few years since the end of the Patriotic War alone, the total turnover of consumer cooperatives in Buryat-Mongolia has almost quadrupled. In their speeches, the representatives also put forward concrete suggestions for improving trade work to fully meet the growing needs of rural residents.

At the meeting on June 30th, Meng Yongqian, Deputy Director of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives, delivered a congratulatory message on behalf of the members of the Chinese cooperative. He pointed out that the glorious path taken by the Soviet Consumer Cooperatives is a brilliant example for the cooperative movement in all countries of the world.

In the past two days, representatives of cooperative organizations from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland have also delivered congratulatory messages at the meeting. A congratulatory telegram from Thomas Harry Hill, Chairman of the International Cooperative Alliance, was also read at the meeting.

The Congress continued on the 2nd.

    全苏消费合作社中央联合会委员会主席霍赫洛夫在会上作了报告。他指出，消费合作社的工作方针是要最大限度地满足农村居民对消费品的日益增长的需要。在消费合作社第三次代表大会闭幕以来的六年中，农村共开设了几万个新的商店和仓库。现在苏联农村共有三十多万个合作社贸易企业。去年合作社的商品流通额几乎增为一九四八年的三倍。丝织品、毛织品、缝纫品和鞋类在农村中的销售量平均增加为一九四八年的三倍半；砖、石灰、窗玻璃、板石和瓦的销售量为一九四八年的十一倍。农村居民购买的家具、无线电收音机和乐器比前几年增多了好几倍，购买的载重汽车和小汽车等达好几万辆。
    大会还听取了全苏消费合作社中央联合会检查委员会的报告。会议已开始讨论上述两个报告。
    六月三十日、七月一日继续举行会议，讨论全苏消费合作社中央联合会委员会的报告。
    代表们在会上发言时谈到了苏联农村贸易的发展和农村居民购买力迅速提高的情形。例如，在苏联消费合作社第三次代表大会闭幕以来的六年中，白俄罗斯主要消费品的销售量已增加了两、三倍。共和国现在共有一万多个农村商店，在今后两年中至少还将开设两千个新的贸易机构。布利亚蒙古自治共和国在四十年前还没有一个农村商店，现在已经在农村地区开设了几百个百货商店、专业商店和其他商店。仅在卫国战争结束后的几年中，布利亚蒙古的消费合作社的商品流通总额就几乎增为四倍。代表们在发言中还提出了改进贸易工作以充分满足农村居民日益增长的需要的具体建议。
