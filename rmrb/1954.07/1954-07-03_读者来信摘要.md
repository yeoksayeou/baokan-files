Reader's Letters Summary

This Is No Small Matter

Editor's Note: The following four letters reflect how a "single-character difference" in the work of certain staff members has resulted in serious stockpiling and loss of state assets. This kind of error often passes the review of leading cadres and the verification of inspectors, yet remains undetected.

This is no small matter. It shows that they have not treated the glorious task entrusted to them by the state and the people with a conscientious attitude. They have not concretely realized that their every action—even writing a single character—must be responsible to the state and the people, and is directly related to the interests of the state and the people. Consequently, there has emerged this careless, perfunctory work attitude, even making the review work a mere formality.

In order to correct this phenomenon, we must conduct inspection and education from the perspective of ideological understanding and work attitude, and must never regard it as a "chance oversight" or a trivial matter of a single character difference.

Drawing Paper That Will Not Be Used Up in Ten Years

A reader writes: The Construction Section of the Design Company of the Northeast Forest Industry Bureau needed 140 sheets of drawing paper in the second quarter. In late March, Yu Zhiguang, a probationary technician in the Construction Section, drafted the budget. After it was reviewed and approved by Section Chief Wei Jie and Deputy Manager Huang Dan, Wang Dianwei, Deputy Chief of the Finance Section, approved the assignment to Cheng Yuqing, head of the Management Group, to send a purchasing agent to purchase from the China General Merchandise Company's Harbin Regional Wholesale Station.

The drawing paper was delivered to the Design Company's warehouse, transported by handcarts and horse-drawn carts. How did so much drawing paper come to be? It turned out that the Design Company purchased not 140 sheets, but 140 *rolls* of drawing paper from the Harbin Regional Wholesale Station. It is said that the Harbin Regional Wholesale Station did not have enough stock at the time, and it was only after being transferred from other places that the number was made up. This 140 rolls of drawing paper can be used for more than ten years based on the current tasks of the Design Company.

Why did this error occur? The investigation revealed a series of irresponsibilities. Comrade Yu Zhiguang wrote 140 *sheets* as 140 *rolls* when drafting the budget. Section Chief Wei Jie, Deputy Manager Huang Dan, and Deputy Chief of the Finance Section Wang Dianwei did not carefully review it, and signed and stamped their approval. The purchasing agent felt there was a problem when he received the purchase order for 140 rolls of paper for more than 200 million yuan and asked Cheng Yuqing, head of the Management Group, but the reply was: "The manager and section chief have approved it, it must be useful." The purchasing agent had no choice but to follow the order and purchase it. The reason was found, and then, the "relevant personnel"—from the probationary technician to the deputy manager—all made self-criticisms.

Now, after contacting the Harbin Regional Wholesale Station, a batch of drawing paper has been returned, but what remains is still enough to use until the end of 1955.

A Three-Thousand-Jin Horse Cart Scale on a Long Journey

Reader Shi Guoxiang writes: One day in April, a rubber-tired cart came to Zhongyang County from Lishi County, Shanxi Province, carrying a huge object that no one had ever seen before. What was it? Many people curiously asked the cart driver. It turned out to be a horse cart scale weighing more than three thousand jin.

Then, a strange thing happened. The cart driver pulled the horse cart scale to the supply and marketing cooperative, but the supply and marketing cooperative refused to accept it; he pulled it to the county trade union, but the county trade union did not want it either; then he pulled it to the mining section of the county people's government, but the comrades of the mining section still shook their heads and said "don't know." This stumped him. Seeing that it was getting dark, he couldn't delay any longer, so he had to temporarily unload the horse cart scale in the courtyard of the Zhongyang County People's Government.

The horse cart scale lay quietly in the courtyard for several days, and then a comrade came in a hurry and pulled it out of Zhongyang County in a rubber-tired cart. "What exactly is going on with pulling a horse cart scale weighing more than three thousand jin back and forth?" People asked him curiously. It turned out that the matter was like this:

The Shanxi Provincial Coal Industry Building Materials Company purchased a horse cart scale from the local state-owned Taiyuan Iron Factory for the Yangfangkou Coal Industry Building Materials Team in Xin County. Who knew that the comrade in charge of issuing the invoice at the Taiyuan Iron Factory mistakenly wrote "Zhongyang" instead of "Yangfangkou" when shipping the goods, so this horse cart scale began its "long journey," taking the train from Taiyuan to Jiexiu, taking the car from Jiexiu to Lishi, and then taking a rubber-tired cart from Lishi to Zhongyang. Fortunately, the Shanxi Provincial Coal Industry Building Materials Company quickly realized that the horse cart scale had been delivered to the wrong place, and at that time, the Hongtong Coal Industry Building Materials Team also needed such a horse cart scale; this horse cart scale was considered to have taken some shortcuts, returning to Jiexiu by rubber-tired cart and then taking the train to Hongtong.

The "occasional oversight" of the comrade in charge of issuing the invoice at the Taiyuan Iron Factory resulted in: the three-thousand-jin horse cart scale traveling more than eight hundred li back and forth, lasting more than half a month; I don't know how much all the travel expenses cost, but the car fare and cart fare alone were nearly two million.

Enough Eye Drops to Sell for Three Years

Readers Li Zhiren and Luan Baolin write: Pan Zimian, a salesman of the Beijing Pharmaceutical Company, went to Tianjin in December last year to attend the supply meeting for the first quarter of this year and signed a purchase contract for Wogulin eye drops with the Shanghai Supply Station. The company's purchase plan was 9,000 dozen (i.e., 90 boxes), but when he converted "dozen" to "boxes," he mistakenly calculated it as 900 boxes. As a result, he purchased nearly 1 billion yuan worth of eye drops, which, according to the Beijing Pharmaceutical Company's planned sales volume for the first quarter of this year, would be enough to sell for three years.

This incident did not arouse Pan Zimian's due vigilance. In February of this year, when he went to Tianjin to attend the supply meeting for the second quarter to sign the contract, he again made mistakes in the specifications and quantities of some orders. For example, he mistook surgical scissors for surgical knives, ball-tipped straight surgical scissors for straight-pointed surgical scissors, and ball-tipped curved surgical scissors for curved-pointed surgical scissors... For example, the original plan for rubber tubing was 1,500 feet, but he mistakenly ordered 1,500 kilograms, which was thirty times larger than the original planned number (although the Beijing Pharmaceutical Company tried to return the goods and transfer them out, what remained was still ten times larger than the original plan). Liu Zhixiang, who worked with him in Tianjin, checked the signed contract twice, but did not find it either. As a result, the Beijing Pharmaceutical Company suffered unnecessary losses such as stockpiling of funds and increased inventory.

Forty-Five Billion Yuan Less in Payment Received

Reader Xing Yimin writes: In the fourth quarter of last year, the Tianjin Local State-Owned Steel Rolling Mill signed a steel purchase contract with Anshan Iron and Steel Company at the Beijing Steel Allocation Meeting. The quantity of steel ordered was 1,000 tons, the unit price was 5.07 million yuan per ton, and the total value should have been 5.07 billion yuan.

On February 20 of this year, the Eighth District Goods Management Business Office of the Tianjin People's Bank received a notice to collect the payment for this batch of goods and sent someone to the steel rolling mill to handle the collection procedures. The comrades in the accounting section of the steel rolling mill took a look at the "collection order" and saw that the total value of the goods written on it was only more than 500 million yuan, which was nine-tenths less than the original amount. At the same time, the freight to be collected should have been more than 11 million, but it was also mistakenly written as more than 1.1 million, only one-tenth of the original amount. Obviously, this was an error in the work of the accounting department of Anshan Iron and Steel. The comrades in the accounting section of the steel rolling mill asked the comrades of the People's Bank responsible for the collection to contact the accounting department of Anshan Iron and Steel to correct this error. But he didn't care and still collected the payment according to this erroneous figure.

The unpaid amount of more than 4.5 billion yuan was never questioned again by the accounting department of Anshan Iron and Steel; it was the Tianjin Steel Rolling Mill that took the initiative to repay it. Although the problem has been solved, the comrades in the accounting department of Anshan Iron and Steel who handled this matter should learn a lesson from this.

专栏：读者来信摘要

    读者来信摘要
    这不是小事情
    编者按：下面发表的四封来信，反映了由于某些工作人员工作中的“一字之差”，结果就使国家的资财遭受了严重的积压和损失；这种错误，往往经过领导干部的批审和检查人员的核对，而仍没有被发现。
    这不是小事情。这说明他们还没有以兢兢业业的态度来对待国家和人民交托的光荣任务。他们还没有具体地认识到自己的每一个行动——即使写一个字，也要对国家和人民负责，而且是直接关系到国家和人民利益的；因而就出现了这种漫不经心、草草了事的工作态度，甚至使审查工作也流于形式。
    为了纠正这种现象，我们必须从思想认识和工作态度上来进行检查和教育，绝不能把它看作是“偶而疏忽”或是一字之差的小事。    
    十年还用不完的绘图纸
    一读者来信：东北森林工业管理局设计公司建筑科在第二季度需要制图纸一百四十张。三月下旬，建筑科见习技术员于志光缮写预算后，经科长魏秸、副经理黄丹审核批准，再由财务科副科长王殿维批交管理组组长程玉清派采购员向中国百货公司哈尔滨地区批发站购买。
    绘图纸送到了设计公司的仓库，是用手推车和马车运来的。怎么搞了那么多的绘图纸来呢？原来设计公司向哈尔滨地区批发站购买的绘图纸并不是一百四十张，而是一百四十卷。据说，当时哈尔滨地区批发站库存不够，还是向别处调拨以后才凑足了这个数。这一百四十卷绘图纸，按设计公司目前任务计算，能使用十年以上。
    为什么会发生这种错误呢？追查结果，是一连串的不负责任。于志光同志缮写预算时把一百四十张错写成一百四十卷，建筑科科长魏秸、副经理黄丹、财务科副科长王殿维都是没有认真审核，就签名盖章批准了；采购员在接到用两亿多元买一百四十卷纸的购买条时感到有问题，曾问了管理组组长程玉清，但答复是：“经理、科长都批准了，一定有用。”采购员只得遵命购买。原因找出来了，于是，“有关人员”——从见习技术员到副经理，都作了检讨。
    现在，经与哈尔滨地区批发站联系，绘图纸已经退回了一批，但留下的仍够用到一九五五年年底。
    三千斤的马车磅长途旅行
    读者施国祥来信：四月的一天，一辆胶皮大车从山西省离石县来到中阳县，车上拉着一个谁也没见过的庞然大物。这是什么东西？很多人好奇地向赶车工人询问。原来，这是一个体重三千余斤的马车磅。
    接着，奇怪的事情就发生了。赶车工人拉着马车磅到供销社，供销社不收；拉到县工会，县工会也不要；再拉到县人民政府矿业科，矿业科的同志还是摇摇头说“不知道”。这一下可把他难住了，眼看天黑了，不能再耽误，只好把这个马车磅暂时卸到中阳县人民政府的院子里。
    马车磅在院子里静静地躺了好几天，又来了一位同志匆匆地把它用胶皮马车拉出了中阳县。“把三千多斤重的马车磅拉来拉去，到底是怎么回事呀？”人们奇怪地问他。原来，事情是这样的：
    山西省煤业建筑器材公司经地方国营太原铁工厂给忻县阳方口煤业建筑器材小组买下一个马车磅。谁知太原铁工厂负责开票的同志发货时把“阳方口”误写成“中阳”了，于是这个马车磅开始了它的“长途旅行”，从太原上火车到介休，从介休上汽车到离石，又从离石乘胶皮车到了中阳。幸亏山西省煤业建筑器材公司很快发觉马车磅运错了，而那时洪洞煤业建筑器材小组也需用这样的马车磅；这个马车磅才算走了些近路，乘胶皮车返回介休，再乘火车到洪洞去。
    太原铁工厂负责开票的这位同志的“偶一疏忽”，结果是：三千斤的马车磅往返了八百余里，历时半月有余；全部旅费花了多少我不知道，只是汽车费和马车费就将近二百万。
    足够销售三年的眼药水
    读者李志仁、栾宝林来信：北京市医药公司业务员潘子勉在去年十二月到天津参加今年第一季度供应会议，与上海供应站签订沃古林眼药的进货合同。公司进货计划是九千打（即九十箱），但他在由“打”折算“箱”时却错算为九百箱。于是，一下买进了价值将近十亿元的眼药，如按北京市医药公司今年第一季度计划销售量计算，足够销售三年。
    这个事件并没有引起潘子勉应有的警惕。今年二月他到天津参加第二季度供应会议签订合同时，又把某些订货的规格和数量搞错了。如他把手术剪刀错看为手术刀，把球头直手术剪刀错看为直尖手术剪刀，把球头弯手术剪刀错看为弯尖手术剪刀……。又如橡皮管原计划为一千五百呎，他错订了一千五百公斤，比原计划数大了三十倍（后来北京市医药公司虽然设法退货和外调，但留下的仍比原计划大十倍）。和他一起到天津去工作的刘之香对签订的合同曾作了两次查对，但是也没有发现。于是，又使北京市医药公司受到了资金积压、库存加大等不应有的损失。
    少收了四十五亿多元货款
    读者邢一民来信：去年第四季度，天津市地方国营轧钢厂在北京钢材分配会议上和鞍山钢铁公司签订了一份钢材订购合同。订购钢材数量是一千吨，每吨单价五百零七万元，总值应为五十亿零七千万元。
    今年二月二十日，天津市人民银行八区货管营业所收到托收这批货款的通知，就派人到轧钢厂办理托收手续。轧钢厂会计科的同志一看“托收单”，上面所写货值总额只有五亿多元，比原数少了十分之九。同时托收的运费应为一千一百多万，也错成一百十余万，只是原数的十分之一。显然，这是鞍钢会计部门工作中的差错。轧钢厂会计科的同志就要求人民银行负责托收的同志和鞍钢会计部门联系，纠正这个错误。但他不管，仍按着这个错误的数字把款收走了。
    少收的四十五亿多元的款项，鞍钢会计部门再也没有过问；还是天津轧钢厂主动补还的。问题虽然已经解决了，但是鞍钢会计部门经手这件事的同志应该从这件事来接受教训。
