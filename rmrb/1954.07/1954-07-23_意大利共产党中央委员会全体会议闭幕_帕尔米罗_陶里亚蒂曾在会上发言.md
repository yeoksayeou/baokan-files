Xinhua News Agency, July 19th, Rome Dispatch: The plenary session of the Central Committee of the Italian Communist Party continued. According to "Unità," when discussing Giorgio Amendola's report, Deputy General Secretary of the Communist Party, Pietro Secchia, and Secretary-General of the Italian General Confederation of Labor, Vittorio, also spoke. Secchia pointed out the tasks of Communist Party members after Togliatti issued the call for striving to reach an agreement between Catholic Democrats and Communists. Secchia emphasized that the Communist Party should oppose the phenomenon of illegal government actions to defend the democratic freedoms of citizens. Secchia concluded by talking about the Party's propaganda.

Vittorio, in his speech, talked about the struggle of the Italian General Confederation of Labor: The Italian General Confederation of Labor opposes the deceptive agreements signed by the Manufacturers' Association and the splinter trade union organizations. Vittorio said that our current struggle is, first, to strive for higher wages, which should be much higher than those stipulated in the deceptive agreements. Second, it is necessary to affirm the right of working people to propose representatives they trust in union negotiations, rather than representatives who can only gain the trust of business owners. Vittorio emphasized that the working people are fully aware of the justice of the struggle waged by the Italian General Confederation of Labor. Therefore, the number of workers participating in the strike against the deceptive agreement is now much larger than the number of workers participating in the strike a few months ago.

Xinhua News Agency, July 21st, Rome Dispatch: The plenary session of the Central Committee of the Italian Communist Party has concluded. According to "Unità," Palmiro Togliatti spoke during the discussion of Giorgio Amendola's report.

Togliatti emphasized that a broad discussion must be launched on the main issues of general policy before the Party's National Congress, which will be held in the coming months.

Togliatti pointed out that since the Italian Communist Party has become a huge domestic and international force, the basic purpose of the discussion to be held before the National Congress will be: "First, we ourselves should become clearer than before: why we have been able to achieve such development, achieve some considerable successes, especially why we have been able to firmly take root among our base—the working class, the working masses, and the Italian people."

Togliatti said: "In our political activities, we must first expose and effectively counter the behavior of turning the democratic system into a dictatorial system, into a system of government acting arbitrarily. In our political activities, we should unite and mobilize those forces that can prevent this behavior, block it, and regain the positions that have been lost.

"I think the central issue lies here, because the issue of freedom, the issue of national independence, and the issue of peace are all combined here."

Togliatti spoke about the internal situation of the Christian Democratic Party, especially mentioning the rise to power of the Fanfani group, saying: "Within the Christian Democratic Party, there is a faction that demands the implementation of new social policies that are beneficial to the working people, which was particularly evident at the Naples Congress. There is no doubt that this desire may be expressed in a more active form, and we should promote this development. But at least for now, based on all the words and deeds of the new leadership elected at the congress, we can only say: these people have repeatedly promised to promote the development of clerical forces in Italian society and the Italian government."

Togliatti continued: "What kind of predictions can we make about the domestic situation? The most likely assumption is that the current situation will remain the same, that is, the political system will continue to gradually degenerate into a dictatorial system. Therefore, we will have to wage fierce struggles in the economic and trade union fields, as well as in the political field.

"We will launch this struggle and will continue to carry out this struggle, in which we not only know the strength possessed by the current workers' movement and the Italian working people's movement, but also know something else.

"We know that wherever there is a vigorous and surging struggle relying on the unity of progressive forces and the broad masses of workers and peasants, although the material conditions that can be achieved are sometimes not entirely satisfactory, the result of the struggle will definitely play a positive role: creating more favorable conditions for a broader struggle. However, I do not think that the enemy has no tendency to intensify fascism, that is, it cannot be considered impossible for them to take blatant reactionary measures against progressive forces, the working class, the working people, and the entire people in various ways. We know that it is difficult for our enemies to move in this direction, because currently there are such huge democratic forces in Italy, and these democratic forces are represented by the workers' united trade unions, the workers' class and the people's parties, and the support of the vast majority of politically active residents."

Togliatti concluded by saying that the discussion to be held before the National Party Congress should further improve the ideological level of the entire Party; ensure that all Party members have a better understanding of the international situation and its relationship with the domestic situation; and have a deeper understanding of the domestic situation, first of all the economic situation, the development of productive forces, the changes in classes, and how these changes cause political changes in the parties and in the factions of the parties.

Giorgio Amendola made a concluding speech on the discussion.

The Central Committee entrusted the Party leadership to draft a document instructing all Party organizations to launch a discussion on the upcoming National Party Congress throughout the Party.

### 意大利共产党中央委员会全体会议闭幕  帕尔米罗·陶里亚蒂曾在会上发言

    意大利共产党中央委员会全体会议闭幕
    帕尔米罗·陶里亚蒂曾在会上发言
    【新华社十九日讯】据塔斯社罗马十九日讯：意大利共产党中央委员会全体会议继续举行。据“团结报”消息，在讨论乔治·阿门多拉的报告时，共产党副总书记彼特罗·谢嘉和意大利总工会总书记维多里奥等人都作了发言。谢嘉指出了共产党员在陶里亚蒂发出关于争取在天主教党人和共产党人之间达成协议的号召后的任务。谢嘉着重指出，共产党应当反对政府非法横行的现象，以保卫公民的民主自由。谢嘉最后谈到了党的宣传的问题。
    维多里奥在发言时谈到了意大利总工会的斗争：意大利总工会反对制造商联合会和分裂工会组织所签订的骗人的协定。维多里奥说，我们现在的斗争，首先是争取提高工资，这种提高应比骗人的协定所规定的高得多。第二，要肯定劳动人民有权在工会谈判中提出能为他们所信任的代表，而不要那些只能得到企业主信任的代表。维多里奥着重说，劳动人民充分意识到意大利总工会所进行的斗争的正义性。因此，现在参加反对骗人协定的罢工的工人要比参加几个月前的罢工的工人多得多。
    【新华社二十一日讯】据塔斯社罗马二十日讯：意大利共产党中央委员会全体会议已经闭幕。据“团结报”消息，在讨论乔治·阿门多拉的报告时，帕尔米罗·陶里亚蒂曾经发言。
    陶里亚蒂着重指出，在最近几月内就要召开的党的全国代表大会开会之前，必须就总政策的主要问题展开广泛的讨论。
    陶里亚蒂指出，由于意大利共产党已变成了巨大的国内和国际的力量，应在全国代表大会召开前进行的讨论的基本目的将是：“首先我们自己应该弄得比以前更为清楚：为什么我们能够得到这样的发展，获得某些相当大的成就，特别是为什么我们能够在我们的基础——工人阶级、劳动群众和意大利人民中间巩固地扎了根。”
    陶里亚蒂说：“我们在我们的政治活动中，首先应当揭露将民主制度变成专权的制度、变成政府一意孤行的制度这种行为，并对这种行动给予有效的反击。我们在政治活动中应当团结那些能够阻止这种行为、把它挡回去、重新夺回已经失去了的阵地的力量，并使其行动起来。
    “我认为，中心问题就在这里，因为自由的问题，国家独立的问题和和平的问题都在这里结合在一起了。”
    陶里亚蒂谈到天主教民主党的内部情况，特别提到范范尼集团的取得领导权，他说：“在天主教民主党内部，有一派人要求执行有利于劳动人民的新的社会政策，这一点在那不勒斯的代表大会上表现得特别明显。毫无疑问，这种愿望或许将以更积极的形式表现出来，我们应当促进这个发展。但是至少到目前为止，根据代表大会上选出来的新的领导机构的一切言行，我们还只能说：这些人们一而再地允诺促使教权势力在意大利社会和意大利政府中发展。”
    陶里亚蒂继续说：“我们对国内情况能作怎样的预测呢？最有可能的假定就是，现有的情况将保持下去，这就是说，政治制度将继续逐渐蜕化为独裁制度。因而在经济和工会方面以及在政治方面我们将不得不进行激烈的斗争。
    “我们将要发动这个斗争并且将继续进行这个斗争，在这当中，我们不仅知道目前的工人运动和意大利劳动人民的运动所拥有的力量，而且知道某种别的东西。
    “我们知道，凡是依靠进步势力和广大工农群众团结而进行着蓬勃和高涨的斗争的地方，尽管所能争取到的物质条件有时不尽令人满意，但是斗争的结果却一定能起积极的作用：为更广泛的斗争创造更有利的条件。然而，我并不认为敌人就没有了加紧法西斯化的倾向，就是说不能认为他们不可能以各种方式对进步势力、工人阶级、劳动人民和全体人民采取露骨的反动措施。我们知道，我们的敌人要朝这个方向前进是困难的，因为，目前在意大利有这样巨大的民主的力量，这种民主力量的代表者是工人的统一的工会、工人阶级和人民的政党以及绝大多数政治上积极的居民对他们的支持。”
    陶里亚蒂最后说，将在全国党代表大会之前进行的讨论应当进一步提高全党的思想水平；保证全体党员更好地了解国际形势以及它和国内形势的关系；更深刻地了解国内形势，首先是经济情况，生产力的发展，阶级的变化，以及这些变化如何在各党、在各党的派别中引起政治上的变化。
    乔治·阿门多拉就讨论作了总结发言。
    中央委员会委托党的领导拟定一份文件，指示就即将举行的党的全国代表大会在全党各组织中展开讨论。
