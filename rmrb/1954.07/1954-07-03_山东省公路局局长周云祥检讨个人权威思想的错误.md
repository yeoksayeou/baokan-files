    Shandong Provincial Highway Bureau Director Zhou Yunxiang's Self-Criticism of Errors in Personal Authoritarian Thinking

    Letter from Zhou Yunxiang, Shandong Provincial People's Government Transportation Department Highway Bureau: The criticism published in the People's Daily on June 8th regarding my violation of traffic management rules and the existence of personal authoritarian thinking is correct, and I sincerely accept it.

    On May 7th, when I was returning from inspecting work at the Qixia construction site, I took a jeep to Qingdao in Laiyang. When we arrived at the Liuting Highway Management Station, an inspector used a red flag to stop the vehicle and discovered violations of traffic regulations, including the absence of a road maintenance fee exemption certificate on the vehicle and the driver not carrying a driver's license. They wanted to handle the matter. In order to get to Qingdao as soon as possible to catch a train back to Jinan, I used my authority as bureau director to resist the inspection and became very angry, scolding the station's cadres, which had a very bad impact.

    Traffic regulations are formulated by the state to protect the safety of the lives and property of the broad masses of people. As the person in charge of the Highway Bureau, I often talked about the importance of traffic management work in conversations with cadres and when assigning tasks, and I always felt resentment towards those who did not comply with traffic regulations. The Liuting Highway Management Station was inspecting vehicles and wanting to handle violations, which was precisely performing their duties. Logically, I should have taken the lead in exemplarily abiding by traffic regulations and humbly accepting inspection and handling. However, I felt that being inspected by the station would damage my dignity, so I brought out my "Bureau Director" title, implying, "You are under my leadership, how can you control me?" When the station insisted on performing its duty and insisted on conducting the inspection, I became even more angry, slamming the table and scolding the station's cadres for "deliberately making trouble," telling them to examine their "authoritarian thinking," attempting to use threats to resist the inspection. This precisely shows that my own authoritarian thinking is very serious. I violated the law, knowing that violating traffic regulations was wrong, but when it came to myself, I resisted inspection, treating the state's traffic regulations as if they only applied to others and I could be unrestrained. This is a manifestation of the feudal ruler's thinking of "officials are allowed to set fires, but the common people are not allowed to light lamps."

    What is especially serious is that I was studying the documents of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee at the time, yet I still made the mistake of violating Party principles. This erroneous behavior struck a blow to the working enthusiasm of the comrades at the Liuting Highway Management Station, made it difficult for cadres below to carry out their work, and created a negative political impact among the masses, which is completely intolerable. The reason why such a serious mistake occurred is mainly because I have long carried the burden of considering myself a meritorious official, complacent that I am loyal to the Party and have undergone long-term training and testing, and therefore became arrogant and self-satisfied, unable to pay attention to correcting and overcoming my shortcomings, and unable to humbly accept criticism and supervision from the masses. Secondly, my own long-term lack of learning, low political level, and low political consciousness are also important reasons for me making mistakes.

    After the exposure by the masses and the criticism in the newspapers, with the help of the Transportation Department and the Party organization, I have initially recognized the seriousness of my ideological problems. In addition to requesting that the higher authorities give me the punishment I deserve, I am determined to overcome arrogance, complacency, and personal authoritarian thinking in the future, humbly accept criticism and supervision from the masses, and strive to improve my political awareness.

### 山东省公路局局长周云祥检讨个人权威思想的错误

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    山东省公路局局长周云祥检讨个人权威思想的错误
    山东省人民政府交通厅公路局周云祥来信：六月八日人民日报刊登了对我违犯交通管理规则和存在个人权威思想的批评是正确的，我诚恳接受。
    五月七日我由栖霞工地检查工作回来，在莱阳乘坐吉普车到青岛去。行至流亭公路管理站时，检查员以红旗将车摆停，检查出车上未贴养路费免缴证和司机未带驾驶执照等违犯交通规章的事件，要进行处理。我为了争取及早赶到青岛，以便乘火车返回济南，就以局长的权势来抗拒检查，并大发脾气，训斥该站干部，造成了极坏的影响。
    交通规章是国家为了维护广大群众生命财产的安全而制订的。我是负责公路局工作的，平常和干部谈话也好，布置工作也好，经常谈到交通管理工作如何重要，对不执行交通规章的人总是感到痛恨；流亭公路管理站检查车辆并且要对违章事件进行处理，这正是执行他们的职责，按理我应该以身作则，模范地遵守交通规章，虚心接受检查和处理才是。但是，我却认为受该站检查有损我的尊严，就把“局长”的牌子打出来，意思是说你们是受我领导的，还能管着我吗？当该站坚持执行职务一定要进行检查的时候，我更大发脾气，拍桌子训斥该站干部是“故意找麻烦”，要他们检查“权威思想”，企图用威胁的办法来抗拒检查。这恰好说明我自己的权威思想是很严重的。我执法犯法，明知违犯交通规章不对，但轮到自己头上却是抗拒检查，把国家制订的交通规章看成只是管别人的，自己可以不受约束。这是一种“只准官家放火，不让百姓点灯”的封建统治者思想的表现。
    尤其严重的是，当时我正学习了四中全会的文件，竟然就犯了违反党的原则的错误。这种错误行为，打击了流亭公路管理站同志的工作积极性，使下面干部工作不好进行，并在群众中造成了恶劣的政治影响，是完全不能容忍的。这样严重的错误之所以产生，主要因为我思想上长期背着功臣自居的包袱，自以为对党忠实，并经过长期的锻炼和考验，因而骄傲自满，对自己的缺点不能注意纠正和克服，对群众的批评和监督也不能虚心接受；其次，自己长期以来学习不好，政治水平、政治觉悟不高，也是我犯错误的重要原因。
    经过群众的揭发和报纸的批评，在交通厅和党组织的帮助下，我初步认识了自己思想毛病的严重。除了请求上级给我以应得的处分以外，我今后决心克服骄傲自满情绪和个人权威思想，虚心接受群众的批评和监督，努力提高自己的政治觉悟。
