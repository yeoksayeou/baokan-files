    Mr. Smrčka, head of the Czechoslovak Cooperative Delegation, delivered a speech at the First National Congress of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives on the 22nd.

    Smrčka said that although the cooperative movements in People's China and People's Democratic Czechoslovakia have different degrees of development, their tasks are essentially the same, which is to most effectively help improve the material and cultural standards of the working people.

    After briefly introducing the history of the development of the cooperative movement in the Czechoslovak revolution, he said that our consumer cooperative organization today has more than 1.6 million members and 42,000 stores, supplying more than 50% of the residents with various daily necessities and industrial products. The consumer cooperative not only first guaranteed the supply of industrial products to rural consumers, but also carried out the purchase of agricultural products, thus practically helping to consolidate the alliance of the working class and peasants every day and every hour.

    He said: Production cooperatives are also an important component of our national economy. Thanks to the efforts of the members of these cooperatives, the tasks stipulated for production cooperatives in the first Gottwald Five-Year Plan have been completed, and the plan was completed by 106% in the last year. The number of members and the production volume of production cooperatives are constantly increasing and improving. The orientation of production activities is primarily to fundamentally expand and satisfy the production of commodities needed by the broad masses of the people, to help agriculture, and to engage in repair and other service work. Production cooperatives are increasingly using local raw materials and waste materials from local industrial enterprises. Production cooperatives are expanding the number of members, establishing cultural organizations, and organizing cultural groups to continuously develop and consolidate socialist competitions, technical innovation movements, and rationalization proposal movements.

    He said: Housing cooperatives in the Czechoslovak cooperative organization also occupy a certain position. It has 90,000 members organized in county housing cooperatives, and the Central Council of Cooperatives guides its activities.

    Smrčka finally said that our delegation believes that the participation of ourselves and other fraternal countries' delegations in your congress is an expression of a sincere desire to further strengthen the friendly relations between progressive cooperative members. The continuous strengthening of comradely and economic relations between cooperative organizations helps us to carry out our tasks more victoriously. The Czechoslovak cooperative organization will continue to stand together with the Soviet cooperatives and other progressive cooperative members, and in the International Cooperative Alliance, fight against discrimination against cooperative organizations in people's democratic countries, and strive to make the International Cooperative Alliance actively participate in the struggle for world peace and cooperate with all progressive international organizations.

    捷克斯洛伐克代表团团长斯穆鲁卡致词（摘要）
    捷克斯洛伐克合作社代表团团长斯穆鲁卡二十二日在中华全国合作社第一次代表大会上致词。
    斯穆鲁卡说，人民中国的和人民民主的捷克斯洛伐克的合作社运动，虽然有着不同程度的发展，但其任务在实质上都是相同的，这就是最有效地帮助劳动人民物质和文化水平的提高。
    他扼要地介绍了捷克斯洛伐克革命的合作社运动发展的历史后说，我们的消费合作社组织今天已有一百六十万以上的社员和四万二千个销售店，它供给百分之五十以上的居民以各种生活品和工业品。消费合作社不仅首先以工业品保证了对乡村消费者的供应，而且进行着农产品的收购工作，因而在实际上就每天每时地帮助了巩固工人阶级和农民的联盟。
    他说：生产合作社也是我们国民经济中的重要成分。由于这些合作社社员的努力，第一个哥特瓦尔德五年计划中对生产合作社所规定的任务已经完成，最后一年并完成了计划的百分之一百零六。生产合作社的社员数目和生产量都不断地增加和提高。生产活动的方针首先是从根本上扩大和满足广大人民需求的商品的生产，帮助农业，从事修理及其它服务工作。生产合作社正越来越多地使用当地原料和当地工业企业的废料。生产合作社正在扩大社员数量，建立文化组织，组织文化小组不断发展着和巩固着社会主义竞赛、技术革新运动及合理化建议运动。
    他说：在捷克斯洛伐克合作社组织中的房产合作社也占有一定的地位，它有九万社员组织在县的房产合作社中，由合作社中央理事会指导它的活动。
    斯穆鲁卡最后说，我们代表团认为：我们自己和其他各兄弟国家代表团参加你们的代表大会是进一步加强进步的合作社社员间友谊关系的真诚愿望的表现。合作社组织间的同志关系和经济关系的不断加强，帮助我们能更胜利地执行自己的任务。捷克斯洛伐克的合作社组织将继续和苏联合作社及其他进步合作社社员在一起，在国际合作社联盟中，为反对对人民民主国家的合作社组织的歧视而斗争，为使国际合作社联盟积极参加争取世界和平并与一切进步的国际组织进行合作而斗争。
