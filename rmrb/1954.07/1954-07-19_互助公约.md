    Mutual Aid Covenant
    Li Wenshan
    Last year, the Beihou Village in Yadi Township, District Three, Huoxian County, Shanxi Province had seven mutual aid teams. This spring, Beihou Village organized an agricultural production cooperative based on two mutual aid teams with longer mutual aid time and stronger leading backbone. The remaining five groups, due to insufficient conditions, did not transfer to cooperatives. The Xue Qingyuan mutual aid team was one of the better ones. During the days when the cooperative was established, Xue Qingyuan and several members of the group proposed to join the cooperative. At that time, the party branch and the cadres of the township government, considering that leading the mutual aid teams would still be a very important task after the establishment of the cooperative, mobilized Xue Qingyuan and others to continue to stay outside the cooperative to lead the mutual aid teams, on the one hand, to create experience to drive the other four mutual aid teams in the village; on the other hand, to strive for the entire group to collectively transfer to the cooperative after the autumn. Although Xue Qingyuan and several other members were a little unhappy about not being able to join the cooperative immediately, they thought about the whole mutual aid and cooperation movement in the village, and happily accepted this glorious task.
    How can the mutual aid team be run well?
    Running their own mutual aid team well is to set an example for the village's mutual aid teams, and it is also for the collective transfer to the cooperative after the autumn. This greatly encourages the members of the Xue Qingyuan mutual aid team. However, when it comes to running the mutual aid team well, both the leader and the members feel a headache. Last year, although their mutual aid team was not badly run, everyone clearly remembered how they had struggled through the year. Last year, the method of recording work points by "dead calculation and live evaluation" could not be implemented. Which member was to be given work to do, which member had to call people from door to door every morning; when doing work in the fields, many members often slacked off. Rationally arranging work is one of the ways to solve the contradiction between individual management and collective labor, and the group often did this; it was okay on weekdays, but when the busy farming season came, it wouldn't work, everyone felt that their work was the most important and demanded to do their own first. Because these problems were not solved, the members often had small squabbles during the year; the mutual aid team even collapsed twice when hoeing corn and cutting cotton. Obviously, in order to overcome the unstable state of the mutual aid team and strive for collective transfer to the cooperative after the autumn, it is necessary to improve the management methods of the mutual aid team.
      "How can we run our own mutual aid team well?" This was almost the common concern of all the members of the group at the beginning of this year. The group leader Xue Qingyuan and the group accountant Xue Tonghua and several others also considered "making some discipline" or "establishing some systems" to strengthen management work; however, because everyone had no experience and no confidence, they did not dare to determine. On February 18, the agricultural production cooperative held a general meeting of all members to democratically formulate the "Cooperative Constitution." Xue Qingyuan and member Zhu Hongming attended the meeting. At the meeting, they saw with their own eyes how earnestly the members formulated the constitution; and saw how the members expressed their determination to implement the constitution. Xue Qingyuan's heart suddenly opened up. He thought to himself: "This thing is really useful. If the cooperative can make a constitution, can't our group also make some kind of constitution?" He also thought of the role of the "Patriotic Covenant" formulated by the masses in the past. After the meeting, he immediately talked to several activists in the group about his thoughts, and proposed to make a "Mutual Aid Covenant" in the group. Everyone thought it could be tried, so they organized all the members to deliberate. Two days later, the opinions of the members were unanimously agreed upon after consultation, and a general meeting of all members was formally convened to democratically formulate the group's "Mutual Aid Covenant."
    Formulating the "Mutual Aid Covenant" is a process of self-education.
    The mutual aid team is different from the agricultural cooperative, and the "Mutual Aid Covenant" cannot be mechanically copied from the cooperative. But how to formulate it, neither the cadres nor the members of the group knew. After explaining the purpose of formulating the "Mutual Aid Covenant," the members began to speak one after another.
    The first to speak was Xue Tonghua. He said: "The order of doing work should be arranged uniformly by the group, and there should be no rush to be first." The members felt that this opinion should be included in the "Mutual Aid Covenant." Xue Tonghua had a deeper understanding of its importance. It was still last August when the group was cutting cotton, because cutting cotton was an important work, and if the cutting was delayed for a day, the cotton would be damaged. In order to be fair and reasonable, the group democratically decided to cut the irrigated cotton first and then the dry cotton. Xue Tonghua expressed his agreement with the group's decision, but after everyone had cut his irrigated cotton, he asked to continue to cut his dry cotton. Of course, the members would not agree to this request; he angrily withdrew from the group and hired people to cut it. As a result, the mutual aid team was broken up. Afterwards, Xue Tonghua spent more money because he hired people to cut cotton, and other members also suffered many unnecessary losses.
    The next to speak was old man Xue Qingyou. He said: "When working in other people's fields, there should be no favoritism, and no irresponsible attitude should be taken." Xue Qingyou was the inspector of the group last year, responsible for checking the work attitude and quality of the members. Because the group did not implement the "dead calculation and live evaluation," regardless of the strength of labor or the quality of work, all were ten work points. Some members were not very enthusiastic when working in other people's fields, and even delayed work. Xue Qingyou couldn't stand it and wanted to give his opinion, but he was embarrassed, for fear of offending people. Once, the members were weeding wheat on his land, and Zhang Sandong weeded too roughly. The old man got angry and seriously criticized Zhang Sandong. Zhang Sandong was not satisfied, and other members did not support Xue Qingyou. Everyone felt: You are the inspector, why don't you inspect when you work for others, but you are serious when it comes to yourself? They argued a lot. Xue Qingyou still feels wronged now.
    Zhang Chengyou and Wang Huyan are the two strongest young men in the group, and they have less land of their own; in the mutual aid team, they both work for a long time each season. They have the most opinions on the group not implementing the "dead calculation and live evaluation"; they are also very dissatisfied with the group not recording work points and settling accounts on time. At the meeting, after discussing, they put forward such an opinion: "The group should resolutely implement the work point recording system of 'dead calculation and live evaluation,' and should also calculate accounts diligently." Most people agreed to implement "dead calculation and live evaluation"; but Xue Tonghua, Xue Guorui and other four or five members were a little unhappy with the opinion of diligent accounting. These families are all old middle peasant households, with more land and less labor, and they often lose work points in mutual aid. If the group is to calculate accounts diligently, they have to frequently take out money or grain. Although "the wool comes from the sheep" sooner or later, they always feel that it is more convenient to pay later than to pay earlier. At the meeting, there was a small contradiction between these two opinions. However, after persuasion and comparison by the group leader and other members, this contradiction was quickly resolved. These old middle peasant members thought: If they don't help each other, they have to hire people, and hiring four people is not as good as three people in the mutual aid team. Calculating accounts diligently is to consolidate the mutual aid team, which is also beneficial to themselves. So, they all expressed their agreement.
    At this meeting, almost all the cadres and members spoke. Xue Tongguang suggested that the group should hold meetings frequently to study current affairs and policies and carry out criticism and self-criticism; Xue Buyuan suggested that if the group leader or members delay work due to the group's affairs, the entire group should share the work points equally, etc. Based on these many opinions of everyone, the group selected those that had a major relationship with consolidating and improving the mutual aid team, summarized them into six articles, and made them into the group's "Mutual Aid Covenant." Then, each article was discussed in detail and democratically approved.
    When formulating the "Mutual Aid Covenant," the group pointed out that this is not a nail on a board, immutable, and should be constantly revised and supplemented according to the development and changes of the mutual aid team. From the formulation to the present, they have democratically revised it twice, and the covenant has increased from six to ten articles.
    The Benefits of the "Mutual Aid Covenant"
    The Xue Qingyuan mutual aid team has been using the "Mutual Aid Covenant" to manage the mutual aid team for more than three months. Facts have proved that this is indeed an effective way to improve the mutual aid team. The members unanimously believe that it has three major benefits:
    First, the "Mutual Aid Covenant" is based on the democratic voluntariness and common interests of all members of the group. The articles in the covenant are the concentrated expression of the common interests of the entire group. Therefore, it guarantees the unity of all members and promotes the production of the entire group. The members reflected: Walking requires a guide, and sailing requires a compass; with the "Mutual Aid Covenant," we have a goal to strive for. Since the establishment of the mutual aid team in 1952, the group has been calling for the implementation of the work point recording method of "dead calculation and live evaluation," but it has never been implemented. After this article was stipulated in the "Mutual Aid Covenant," "entering the land to evaluate work, and leaving the land to score points" has now formed a system. Whoever works well and does more can get more points. This not only improves the work enthusiasm of the members, but also promotes the unity of the entire group. Last year, the members often quarreled red-faced over some minor issues. This year, the group's two inspectors act according to the covenant everywhere. No matter whose land they work on, they must carefully inspect it, and the members themselves no longer worry that others will not cultivate well for them. Although the "Mutual Aid Covenant" requires each member to be relatively strict, this is in line with the interests of the entire group and also in line with the individual interests of each member, so everyone is willing to implement it.
      Second, it has cultivated the members' collectivist ideology and the habit of abiding by labor discipline. The "Mutual Aid Covenant" has a certain binding force on all members. As the members said, this is "empty words are useless, written words are proof," and "you have to implement the regulations you have made yourself." Weeding wheat and planting cotton are both relatively important tasks. From the bottom of their hearts, every member wants the group to do it for them first, but when they think of the regulations in the "Mutual Aid Covenant," they all obey the unified arrangements of the group. When weeding wheat this year, because watering wheat is done from east to west, the group reasonably stipulated that hoeing should be done from east to west; when planting cotton, the group also reasonably stipulated: whichever piece of land is watered first, whichever piece of land is plowed first, will be planted first. This rational arrangement of work is beneficial to every member; obeying unified leadership and abiding by labor discipline have gradually become the conscious actions of the members. On April 20, some wheat in the village suffered from frost damage and needed to be rescued immediately. If it were in the past, the mutual aid team would have been in danger of "collapsing." Because of the "Mutual Aid Covenant," the members did not rush to be first. The group made unified arrangements based on the degree of damage to each piece of land. Fifteen mu and three fen of seriously damaged wheat in the entire group were rescued by collective efforts in just two days. Now, in daily labor, whenever members do something, they have to think about whether it is in accordance with the "Mutual Aid Covenant." If there is a violation, they will take the initiative to make a self-criticism. When member Xue Tongguang proposed to join the cooperative this spring, the members felt that he lacked the morality of collective labor and did not pass. After the group established the "Mutual Aid Covenant," he earnestly implemented it. He said: "It is not easy to participate in the agricultural production cooperative if you cannot be a good member." Ordinary members are even making such plans: "Now be a good member, and it will be easier to be a good member in the future." This has prepared important conditions for the collective transfer to the cooperative in the future.
    Third, with the "Mutual Aid Covenant," the mass self-initiated supervision from the bottom up and the leader's leadership from the top down are closely combined, and the affairs of the group are easy to lead. Xue Qingyuan said: "It is difficult to lead a group of more than ten households by relying on the group leader alone. With this democratically formulated covenant, it has become everyone managing everyone." In the past, some members did not implement the group's decisions and did not obey the group's unified leadership. In addition to the group leader criticizing or making self-criticism at the meeting, other members generally did not want to come forward to "cause trouble." Now, "acting according to the covenant" is the unanimous requirement of all members, and they have a basis for criticizing others and are bolder; at the same time, everyone also realizes that if there is only the "Mutual Aid Covenant" without criticism and inspection, no matter how well the covenant is made, it is difficult to play its due role. In April, when weeding wheat, one morning, member Guo Donglin was late for work by one meal's time because he was handling private affairs. The members proposed to deduct points, Guo Donglin also agreed, and half a work point was deducted. Afterwards, the members said: If it were last year, even if Guo Donglin was late by an hour, others would certainly not care.
    Since the establishment of the "Mutual Aid Covenant," the Xue Qingyuan mutual aid team has obviously shown many new atmospheres in the past three months. During the period of transition from spring to summer in April and May, six families in the group lacked food. In order to reduce the government's supply to themselves, they made possible mutual adjustments within the scope of the mutual aid team. They did all kinds of tasks in spring plowing production ahead of all the mutual aid teams in the village; raking wheat, rescuing frost-damaged wheat seedlings and other work played a leading role for the mutual aid teams in the six natural villages in the whole township. With the implementation of "dead calculation and live evaluation" and regular work point calculation and account settlement, the labor efficiency and cultivation quality of the members have improved. This year, hoeing wheat has saved an average of about one and a half work points per mu compared to previous years. Now the members of the whole group are very united; the shortcomings of the mutual aid team's instability have been overcome. Everyone unanimously requested to keep the mutual aid team running well and collectively transfer to the cooperative after the autumn.
    Several issues to be noted
    Before formulating the "Mutual Aid Covenant," the Xue Qingyuan mutual aid team consulted the District Committee of the Communist Party of China in this district, and the County Committee of the Communist Party of China in Huoxian County also studied this matter. After the "Mutual Aid Covenant" was formulated, Xue Qingyuan introduced it to the heads of agricultural cooperatives and mutual aid team leaders who attended the example meeting of the mutual aid and cooperation network in Yaodi Base Point in this district, and the feedback from all parties was very good. Some mutual aid teams have begun to learn and use this method.
    According to the experience of the Xue Qingyuan mutual aid team, the following points should be paid attention to when formulating the "Mutual Aid Covenant": First, it must be in line with the actual situation of the group, and it is necessary to truly grasp the key to improving the mutual aid team, and ensure that every word is specific and every article is feasible, to prevent the tendency of formalism and excessive requirements. Otherwise, it will affect the mutual aid sentiment of the members and even hinder the enthusiasm of individual farmers outside the group to join the group. Secondly, it must be the unanimous requirement of all members of the group; the content of the "Mutual Aid Covenant" must also be the mass opinions that have been truly democratically discussed; at the same time, it must be continuously revised and supplemented according to the development and changes of the mutual aid team. Only in this way can the "Mutual Aid Covenant" be effective. After formulating the "Mutual Aid Covenant," one cannot think that everything is "all right"; one cannot overemphasize the role of the "Mutual Aid Covenant." It is still necessary to strengthen all aspects of leadership within the group, and especially pay attention to regularly checking the implementation of the "Mutual Aid Covenant."

    互助公约
    李文珊
    山西省霍县三区鸭底乡北侯村去年共有七个互助组。今年春天，北侯村以互助时间较长、领导骨干较强的两个互助组为基础，组织起一个农业生产合作社。其余五个组，由于条件不够，没有转社。薛庆源互助组是其中较好的一个。建社那几天，薛庆源和组里的几户组员提出要入社。当时，党的支部和乡政府的干部们考虑到建社以后领导互助组仍然是很重要的工作，动员薛庆源等继续留在社外领导互助组，一方面创造经验带动全村另外的四个互助组；一方面争取今年秋后全组集体转社。薛庆源和另外几个组员对于不能即时入社虽然有些不高兴，但想了想全村整个的互助合作运动要搞好，也就愉快地接受了这一个光荣的任务。
    怎样才能把互助组办好呢
    办好自己的互助组，是为了给全村互助组做榜样，又是为了今年秋后集体转社，这对薛庆源互助组组员的鼓舞很大。但是，一提起办好互助组，不论组长和组员，谁都感到头痛。去年，虽说他们互助组办得不算坏，可是大家也都清楚地记得这一年是怎样熬过来的。去年一年，死分活评的记工办法高低实行不开。给哪个组员做营生，每天早晨哪个组员得挨门子叫人；到地里做营生，不少组员还常常偷懒耍滑。合理安排营生是解决个体经营与集体劳动之间的矛盾的办法之一，组里也经常这样做；平素还可以，一到农忙季节，就行不通了，谁也觉得自己的营生最要紧，都要求先做自己的。因为这些问题没有得到解决，一年当中，组员们经常闹些小别扭；锄玉茭和打切棉花时，互助组还垮过两次台。显然，要克服互助组的不稳定状态，争取秋后集体转社，必须提高和改进互助组的管理方法。
      “怎样才能把自己的互助组办好呢？”今年一开春，这几乎是全组组员所共同考虑的问题。组长薛庆源和组里会计薛同化等几个人也盘算过要“弄个什么纪律”或“订上些制度”来加强管理工作；不过，因为大家都没经验、没把握，所以都没敢确定。二月十八日，农业生产合作社里开全体社员大会民主制订“社章”，薛庆源和组员朱红明俩人去参加了。会上，他们亲眼看到社员们怎样认真地订社章；又看到社员们如何表示自己坚决执行社章的态度。这一下，薛庆源的心豁然开朗了。他暗自思想：“这玩艺儿作用真大。社里能订章程，咱组里不能也订个什么章程？”他还联想起过去群众制订“爱国公约”的作用。散会后，他马上和组里的几个积极分子谈了谈自己的心思，提出在组里订个“互助公约”。大家都认为可以试试，就组织全体组员酝酿起来。两天以后，组员们的意见经过磋商一致了，就正式召开全体组员大会，民主制订本组的“互助公约”。
    订“互助公约”是一个自我教育的过程
    互助组和农业社不一样，订“互助公约”不能照瓢画葫芦硬跟社里学。可是究竟该怎样订，全组干部、组员心里也没有数。说明了订“互助公约”的目的，组员们便你一言他一语地说起来。
    第一个发言的是薛同化。他说：“做营生先后应当由组里统一安排，不能争先恐后。”这个意见，组员们都觉得应该订在“互助公约”上。薛同化对它的重要性体会得更深刻一些。还是去年八月组里打切棉花的时候，因为打切棉花是个要紧营生，该打切的如果推迟一天，棉花就会受损失。为了做到公平合理，组里民主决定先打切水地棉花、后打切旱地棉花。组里这样决定，薛同化表示同意，但是等大家给他打切完水地棉花，他又要求接着给他打切旱地棉花。当然，组员们不会同意这个要求；他就赌气退了组雇人打切。结果把互助组给搞散了。事后，薛同化因为雇人打切棉花多出了工钱，其它组员也受了许多不应有的损失。
    接着发言的是薛庆有老汉。他说：“到别人地里劳动不能有偏心，不能采取不负责任的态度。”薛庆有去年是组里的检查员，负责检查组员们的劳动态度和劳动质量。因为组里不实行死分活评，不管劳动强弱、做营生好坏，一律都是十分工，有些组员到别人地里劳动就很不起劲儿，甚至推屎托尿磨日头。薛庆有看不惯，想提意见，但又不好意思，怕得罪人。有一次，组员们在他的地上锄麦子，张三东锄得过于粗糙，这老汉发火了，认真地批评了张三东。张三东不满意，其它组员也不支持薛庆有，大家觉得：你是检查员，为什么给别人做活儿不检查，偏偏轮到自己头上就认真起来了？七嘴八舌吵了一顿。薛庆有如今还觉得满肚子冤屈。
    张成有、王胡眼是组里两个劳动力最强的年轻人，他们自己的土地也比较少；在互助组中，他们那一季都长许多工。组里不实行死分活评，他们意见最多；组里不按时记工算账，他们也很不满意。在会上，他俩商量之后提出这样一个意见：“组里应该坚决实行死分活评的记工制度，同时要勤算账。”对于实行死分活评，大都同意；可是对勤算账这个意见，薛同化、薛国瑞等四、五户组员却有些不痛快了。这几家都是老中农户，地多、劳力少，在互助中经常亏工。组里要勤算账，他们就得勤往出拿钱或粮食。虽然迟出早出反正“羊毛要出在羊身上”，但是他们总觉得迟出比早出要方便些。在会上，这两方面的意见有了小小的矛盾。不过，经过组长和其它组员说服、对比，这个矛盾很快便解决了。这几户老中农组员一想：不互助自己就得雇人，雇上四个人还不如互助组里三个人做得多。勤算账是为了巩固互助组，这对自己也有利益。于是，他们也都表示同意了。
    在这次会上，干部、组员们差不多全都发了言。薛同光提议组里应经常开会，学习时事政策，开展批评和自我批评；薛补元提议组长或组员因组里的事情误了工应由全组平均负担还工等等。组里就根据大家这许多意见，拣对巩固和提高互助组有重大关系的，归纳成六条，订成本组的“互助公约”。然后又一条一条经过详细讨论和民主通过。
    订“互助公约”时，组里就提出过这不是木板上钉钉子，一成不变，根据互助组的发展变化，要不断修改和补充。从制订到如今，他们已民主修订了两次，公约由六条增为十条。
    “互助公约”的好处
    薛庆源互助组运用“互助公约”管理互助组，已经有三个多月了。事实证明，这的确是提高互助组的一个有效的办法。组员们一致认为它有三大好处：
    第一，“互助公约”建立在全组组员民主自愿和共同利益的基础之上，公约里的条文是全组共同利益的集中表现，因此它保证了全体组员的团结，推动了全组的生产。组员们反映：走路要有带路人，行船要有指南针；有了“互助公约”，我们有了奋斗目标。自一九五二年互助组成立以来，组里就一直喊叫要实行死分活评的记工办法，但始终实行不了。当“互助公约”上把这一条规定下来之后，“入地评工，出地评分”现在已形成了制度。谁劳动得又好又多，谁就可以多得分。这样，不仅提高了组员们的劳动积极性，也促进了全组的团结。去年，组员们常常因为一些细小问题争吵得脸红脖子粗。今年，组里的两个检查员处处按公约规定办事，不论到谁家地里劳动，都要认真检查，组员自己也就不再耽心别人给自己耕作得不好了。“互助公约”上虽然对每个组员要求得都比较严格，但这符合全组的利益，也符合每个组员的个人利益，所以大家都愿意执行。
      第二，培养了组员们的集体主义思想和遵守劳动纪律的习惯。“互助公约”对全体组员有一定的约束力量。正如组员们所讲的，这是“空口无凭，立字为证”，“自己订出的章程，自己就得执行”。锄麦子、种棉花都是比较紧要的营生，从内心讲，那个组员也想让组里先给自己做，但一想到“互助公约”上的规定，就都服从组里的统一安排了。今年锄麦子时，因为浇麦子是从东往西挨，组里便合理地规定从东往西挨块锄；种棉花时，组里也合理地规定：先浇那块地，先犁那块地，也就先种那块地。这样合理地安排营生，对每户组员都有好处；服从统一领导，遵守劳动纪律，便逐渐成了组员们自觉的行动。四月二十日，村里有部分小麦遭受了冻灾，需要立即抢救。要是往常，互助组就有“倒塌”的危险。因为有了“互助公约”，组员们没有争先恐后，由组里根据各块地的受灾程度，作了统一的安排。全组十五亩三分受灾严重的小麦，在短短两天里便用集体的力量抢救过来了。如今，在日常劳动中，组员每逢做一件事，都要想一想合不合“互助公约”。如有违犯，就主动地做检讨。组员薛同光今年春天提出入社时，社员们认为他缺乏集体劳动的道德，没通过。组里订立“互助公约”以后，他就认真执行。他说：“不能当个好组员，参加农业生产合作社也不容易。”一般的组员，更是作着这样的打算：“现在当个好组员，以后就容易当个好社员。”这为将来集体转社，准备了重要的条件。
    第三，有了“互助公约”，群众性的自下而上的监督和组长自上而下的领导密切结合起来了，组里的事情好领导了。薛庆源说：“十多户人家的一个组，单凭组长一个人是难以领导好的。有了这个民主制订的公约，就成了大家管教大家了。”过去，有些组员不执行组里的决定，不服从组里的统一领导，除了组长批评或开会时自我检讨之外，其它组员一般是不愿意出头“惹人”的。现在，“照公约办事”是全体组员的一致要求，批评别人的时候有了根据，胆子大了；同时，大家也认识到光有“互助公约”，没有批评、检查，公约订得再好，也难以起应有的作用。四月间，锄麦子的时候，一天上午组员郭东林因为办私人事情，上地迟到了吃一顿饭的工夫，组员们都提出要扣分，郭东林也表示同意，便扣了半分工。事后组员们说：要是去年，就是郭东林迟到一点钟，保险别人也不管。
    订了“互助公约”以后，薛庆源互助组三个多月来明显地出现了许多新气象。四、五月间青黄不接，组里有六家缺粮户。为了减少政府对自己的供应，他们在互助组的范围内作了可能的互相调剂。春耕生产中的各种营生，他们都做在了全村所有互助组的前头；耙麦子、抢救受冻麦苗等工作，对全乡六个自然村的互助组都起了带头作用。随着死分活评和定期齐工算账的执行，组员们的劳动效率和耕作质量都提高了，今年锄麦子每亩地平均比往年都节省一分半左右的人工。如今全组组员团结得很好；互助组不稳固的缺点，已经克服了。大家一致要求把互助组坚持办好，秋后集体转社。
    应当注意的几个问题
    薛庆源互助组制订“互助公约”之前，曾请示过本区中共区委会，中共霍县县委对这件事情也做过研究。“互助公约”制订之后，薛庆源在本区窑底基点互助合作网例会上向到会的农业社社长、互助组长作过介绍，各方面的反映都很好。有些互助组已开始学习和运用这个办法。
    根据薛庆源互助组的经验，制订“互助公约”应注意这样几点：首先，必须切合本组的实际情况，要真正抓住提高自己互助组的关键，做到字字具体，条条可行，防止发生形式主义和要求过高的偏向。不然，反而会影响组员的互助情绪，甚至会妨害组外个体农民入组的积极性。其次，必须是全体组员群众的一致要求；“互助公约”的内容，也必须是真正经过民主讨论的群众性的意见；同时，要根据互助组的发展变化，不断修改和补充。只有这样，“互助公约”才能行之有效。制订“互助公约”以后，不能认为就“万事大吉”了；不能过分夸大“互助公约”的作用。在组内仍须加强各方面的领导，尤其应注意定期检查“互助公约”的执行情况。
