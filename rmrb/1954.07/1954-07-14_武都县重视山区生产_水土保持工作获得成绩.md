Wudu County, Gansu Province, has mountainous areas accounting for more than 90% of the county's total land area. Due to past soil erosion, much fertile farmland has gradually turned into ditches. Therefore, the county leadership pays special attention to leading mountainous area production. Last year, work teams were sent to various places to guide and assist the masses in afforestation and soil and water conservation work. This spring and summer, several meetings were held to study and deploy soil and water conservation work, resulting in considerable achievements.

According to incomplete statistics, the county has built more than 1,300 mu of terraced fields, dug more than 4,600 water storage ponds, 9,600 contour trenches, built more than 4,800 field ridges, and constructed more than 32,000 stone walls. The afforestation area completed is 700 mu, with more than 430,000 trees planted, including many economic forests, totaling more than 50,000 prickly ash trees and more than 10,000 various fruit trees.

    武都县重视山区生产
    水土保持工作获得成绩
    甘肃省武都县山地面积占全县土地面积的百分之九十以上，由于以往的水土流失，使许多肥沃良田逐渐变成了沟渠。因而县领导上特别重视对山区生产的领导，去年便派工作组到各地领导与帮助群众进行植树造林工作及水土保持工作。今年春夏又几次开会研究布置水土保持工作，因而获得不少成绩。
    据不完全统计，全县共修梯田一千三百多亩，挖涝池四千六百多个，水平沟九千六百条，培地埂四千八百多条，砌石墙三万二千多条。完成造林面积七百亩，植树四十三万多株，其中造的经济林很多，计花椒树五万多株，各种果树一万多株。
