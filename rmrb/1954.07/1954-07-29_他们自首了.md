     Editor's Note: We are now publishing the translated versions of two communications, "They Surrendered..." published in the Soviet "Izvestia" on June 15, 1954, and "The Spies Fall into the Net" published in "Komsomolskaya Pravda." The facts revealed in these two communications show that the US special service agencies are using Japan, West Germany, etc., as bases to continuously dispatch special agents and spies who infiltrate the Soviet border from land, sea, or air, tasking them with gathering Soviet economic, military, and other intelligence, sabotaging Soviet peaceful construction, and serving the aggressive war they are intensifying preparations for. The people of our country should learn from these facts, further raise their revolutionary vigilance, and at all times and places strictly guard against the destructive activities of US imperialist special agents and spies.
     They Surrendered...
     Soviet Union, Ke·Bideluofu
    Not long ago, two American spies, Yaguda and Goodliavtsev, surrendered to the state security organs, confessing to the anti-Soviet sabotage activities of the US intelligence agencies.
    The experiences of these two spies once again reveal the criminal methods of the US intelligence agencies, which recruit agents from so-called "immigrants," provide them with specialized training in operational sabotage at special agent schools established in West Germany, and then secretly dispatch them into Soviet territory to carry out criminal activities.
    Yaguda and Goodliavtsev gave detailed accounts of the methods and objectives of the US intelligence agencies.
    Yaguda's path to becoming an American spy began with his cowardice on the battlefield against the Hitlerite bandits. As a result of his cowardice, Yaguda was captured and became a servant of his homeland's enemies. He endured all kinds of torment, being moved from one place to another. In the face of the victorious pursuit by the Soviet army, he and others like him were driven to the western border of Germany, where he became a "prisoner" for the second time—this time captured by the American army.
    Yaguda described in detail how the American "liberators" herded all these people—Russians, French, Dutch, Belgians, Poles—like livestock with sticks onto trucks, driving them into livestock pens surrounded by barbed wire, without giving them food or drink. All these measures were for one blatant purpose: to drive these people into a desperate situation where they would see any way out as salvation.
    In this situation, Yaguda agreed to the suggestion of people from Munich who were recruiting laborers. As a result, he fell under the servitude of White Russian émigré foremen—Moyseyev, Somov, and other bandits—who ruthlessly exploited their employees, using their hands to repair former German airfields for the Americans.
    Yaguda thus gradually changed from a prisoner of war to an "immigrant," that is, a person without a homeland, without rights, and without guarantees.
    After another short period, Yaguda fell into the hands of the White Russian Pauletliav, who was trafficking in "live goods" to South America and Africa. Yaguda was thus brought to Africa.
  Yaguda said: "It is difficult for Soviet people to imagine what it is like to be in this situation, when you feel unprotected, without a protector, without a country behind you, without the authority of the state to support you, without a state representative to whom you can turn."
    The "immigrants" labored and died in labor camps in Morocco. The largest shareholder in this labor camp was Duke Beloselsky, who fled from Russia to Paris in 1917. His accomplices and assistants were White Russian émigrés Fedchenko, Bliuno, and others.
   "Immigrants" in Morocco began to receive intense anti-Soviet training, instilling in them the idea that only those who actively participate in the anti-Soviet struggle could hope to become "successful."
    A person named Batalakov appeared on the stage. He was the chairman of a certain White Russian émigré "association." He played the role of a Russian who sympathized with the plight of his compatriots, advising them to go to West Germany, saying that there were specialized schools there where they could learn everything they needed if they hoped to return to the Soviet Union.
    Yaguda was a person who could be "persuaded" without much effort. He was a morally corrupt, heavy drinker. After Batalakov fully satisfied his thirst for alcohol, Yaguda agreed to go to West Germany to attend a spy school led by Batalakov. On his way to Germany, Yaguda spent some time in Paris: there, he underwent some "political tempering" under the leadership of the White Russian émigré—the son of former Tsar Minister Stolypin.
    According to Yaguda, the spy school was located in the resort town of Bad Homburg, twenty kilometers from Frankfurt on the Main River. The spy school operated under the guise of the "Soviet Research Institute." The address of the school was: Kaiser Friedrich Promenade 57-59. This "school" was previously located in Limburg before moving to Bad Homburg.
    The teachers at the school were all White Russian émigrés and traitors: the principal, Martinoff, was an old White Guard émigré, the son of a Tsarist officer; the vice-principal, Tarasov, was also a White Russian émigré; those who lectured on "courses" were Batalakov, Bariemsky, Redlich, Utechen, Ogolovich, and others.
    After the school course ended, Yaguda and other "students" were taken to the outskirts of Munich. At a quiet villa on the banks of the Starnberger See, three Americans received them. One of them was named Herlige; his code name was Igor Sergeievich.
    The Americans carefully examined the resumes of the people sent. Then, various exercises were carried out at the American shooting range: parachuting, shooting. Finally, Yaguda and his three companions came to a villa in Bad Wiessee, a resort on the banks of the Tegernsee, not far from Munich.
    In Bad Wiessee, Yaguda changed his name to "Paul," and the young man who stayed with him afterwards was given the code name "Bob."
    This young man was Goodliavtsev. His history is slightly shorter than Yaguda's. When Goodliavtsev was just fourteen years old, his hometown was temporarily occupied by the Hitlerite bandits. At that time, some brave Soviet youths chose the path of fighting against the irreconcilable enemy. Goodliavtsev was timid, succumbed to fascist propaganda, and became an accomplice of the occupiers. On this degenerate path, he also experienced almost the same journey as his older partner "Paul"—Yaguda, and he also ended up in Morocco. After receiving training in the Boy Scout organization, people like Batalakov appeared, who took him to the spy school in Bad Homburg, and then sent him to the banks of the Tegernsee.
    There, the basic "tenets" of American spies were instilled in his mind every day: hatred and annihilation of everything Soviet, assassinations and explosions.
    Despite the strong effect of this constant training, which attempted to transform young people into conscious enemies of the Soviet state, he still pondered what was happening more than once. The reason for his suspicion was that he received snippets of information from some people who had correspondence with their relatives, and sometimes heard Soviet broadcasts about life in the homeland.
    Goodliavtsev said: "I can say with certainty that if the Americans had not constantly intimidated the 'immigrants,' creating the ghost of so-called punishment for anyone who returned to the Soviet Union, then many 'immigrants' would have been very happy to return to their homes long ago."
    Despite this, Goodliavtsev—"Bob," like "Paul"—Yaguda, dutifully studied at the American "advanced" spy school in Bad Wiessee. The trainers here were not only the "Russian" principal, Boris Borisovich Martinoff, and other White Russian émigrés, but also Americans who did not conceal their identity as staff members of the US intelligence agencies. Among them was Captain Herlige, also known as "Bill," and also called "Igor Sergeievich," who was recognized as an expert in formulating instructions for dispatching action-sabotage elements to the Soviet Union. Other American instructors, code-named "Vologda," "Max," and "Danny," taught radio, secret writing, how to identify types of Soviet aircraft and weapons, code communication, and other spy techniques.
    One of the most important issues for American intelligence personnel was to ensure that if spies sent to the Soviet Union were caught, they would not reveal their connection to the US intelligence agencies. To this end, they tried to convince these trainees that anyone who wanted to betray his American masters and surrender to the Soviet authorities would inevitably be executed. All agents sent to the Soviet Union were strictly warned that in case of emergency, they could say that they were agents of White Russian organizations, which in reality were branches of the US intelligence agencies.
    After these spies completed their training at the Bad Wiessee American spy school, they underwent another test. They were assessed on their ability to use radios, codes, secret writing, weapons, maps, and city maps. Most of these tests were conducted at the American shooting range. There, an American sergeant radio operator recorded the radio transmission techniques of each person being tested. Here they also received additional instructions, that if they "gained a foothold" in the Soviet Union, they should carry out activities to undermine the prestige of Party and government cadres, and activists in literature and science. Write provocative black letters.
    After they underwent these two weeks of trials, Captain Herlige loaded these trained spies into a car and took them to a military warehouse near the American barracks in Munich. Under the supervision of American Lieutenant "Paul," they were finally equipped with all the equipment for parachuting from a plane, carefully packaged maps, weapons, bullets, radios, codes, Soviet banknotes, and other items; when all traces or small marks that could be considered American products were eliminated from all items, when gold coins were sewn into their clothes, Captain Herlige gave the final instructions.
    In these instructions, the following points were repeated: he stated definitively that if they were caught in Soviet territory, they should by no means confess that they were special agents belonging to the US intelligence agency system; Herlige also gave them "friendly" advice: the best way to escape serious consequences when caught was to commit suicide by taking poison. He showed "Paul" and "Bob" a small needle containing a deadly poison that would kill them instantly according to his instructions that they should be sewn immediately into the collar of their shirts. As long as they bite the collar of their shirt, they would die immediately.
    They finally took off from Munich. The first leg of the journey was to Thessaloniki, Greece, escorted by American intelligence officers Major Harold Irwin Fiddler ("Vologda") and another major. There, Yaguda—"Paul" and Goodliavtsev—"Bob" were loaded into a four-engine bomber without any markings.
    The plane flew at high altitude without any usual lights. Suddenly it shot down like an arrow. The signal light came on, this was the order: prepare to parachute. Both put on their parachute equipment and prepared for the last time and stood in front of the plane door. An American who came out of the cockpit opened the door latch. Behind him stood another American, frowning at the two spies.
    Goodliavtsev was the first to step into the pitch-black abyss outside the cabin. Yaguda hesitated, at this time an American navigating officer pushed him down hard, he lost his balance and fell out of the plane...
    According to Yaguda and Goodliavtsev themselves, from the time they landed on Soviet soil until they surrendered to the Soviet State Security Agency, they always felt incapable of disguising themselves and mingling with the Soviet people. It was this fear of being recognized and captured that constantly drove them both from place to place.
    The helpless situation they found themselves in on Soviet soil became unbearable. They increasingly felt that they would rather be exposed than wander around like two wolves. Yaguda and Goodliavtsev were always thinking about their long-lost homeland. They always thought about how they had been dragged into the plot against the Soviet people, also against themselves, by the Americans. More and more recalled their life in Germany and Africa, the ghost shadows of former Tsarist prosecutors and generals, the ghost shadow of Herlige and his "gift" - the deadly poison needle, often emerged in their memories.
    Although the two men did not consult with each other, their actions were completely consistent, they both delayed contacting "Mr. Tony" by radio. They can't remember how the first conversation about this began, but they finally reached an agreement: bury all their equipment and use their forged documents to find work. At first they thought that no one would know their past, they had money in their hands, and they could work and start a new life.
    But the more Yaguda and Goodliavtsev considered this plan, the more clearly they felt that with such a heavy secret baggage, they could never face the surrounding Soviet people squarely, and they would never feel that they were Soviet citizens enjoying all equal rights.
    When they understood this, they immediately surrendered to the security agency of the city where they found temporary shelter. There they handed over their equipment, including: short-wave radio transceiver, radio signal machine for indicating aircraft landing, weapons (including silent weapons), codes, encoding table, maps, compass; secret writing equipment; blank certificates of various Soviet agencies; citizen's certificate and military service certificate; forged identity documents obtained from the American intelligence agency; Soviet banknotes and gold; foreign secret communication addresses. They should send coded spy intelligence to these foreign secret communication addresses. These addresses are: Vit Yuri Bussard, 11 Adrian Street, Liege, Belgium; FMB Kolas Daunei, Arlevik Karl Danger, Norway; Berlin, Ochlin Dorfer, Wolich Rooten Street 15, (Gan and Shurman O. H. G.).
    They spoke in detail about the tasks they received from the American intelligence agency. After lying dormant in Moscow, they would begin to collect and send information about economic and military targets; recruit agents to conduct intelligence and action-sabotage activities; undermine the prestige of famous national figures, activists of Party and social groups, and staff members of the Soviet regime by writing black letters; kill Soviet people and seize their documents; report to the American intelligence center the Soviet documents that must be prepared for sending agents to the Soviet Union; use radio signal machines to indicate the landing of subsequent spies, and help enemy aircraft bomb Soviet targets in wartime.
    Yaguda and Goodliavtsev refused to carry out the tasks of the American intelligence agency and surrendered. They were not only not "executed" as the American intelligence agency had threatened them, but were given the full possibility of living freely and working in their own country. Now the two of them once again felt that they were sons of their great motherland. They are striving to work for the benefit and happiness of the Soviet people. The Soviet people rescued them from the bottomless abyss and brought them back to their ranks, in this abyss there are still many unfortunate "immigrants" who have become victims of American imperialism and its sinister schemes.

### 他们自首了……

专栏：

     编者按：现将一九五四年六月十五日苏联“消息报”刊载的“他们自首了……”，“共青团真理报”刊载的“落网的间谍”两篇通讯译出刊登在这里。这两篇通讯揭露的事实表明：美国特务机关正以日本、西德等作为基地，不断地派遣特务、间谍，从陆地、海上或空中潜入苏联国境，要他们刺探苏联的经济、军事等情报，破坏苏联的和平建设，并为它们正在加紧准备的侵略战争服务。我国人民应从这些事实中吸取教训，进一步提高革命警惕性，随时随地严防美帝国主义的特务间谍破坏活动。
     他们自首了……
     苏联　柯·彼得洛夫
    不久前有两个美国间谍亚古达和古德利亚弗茨夫来到国家保安机关自首了，他们供述了美国情报机关的反苏破坏活动。
    这两个间谍的经历再一次揭露出美国情报机关的罪恶方法，他们从所谓“移民”中招募特务，并在西德成立的特务学校里进行行动性破坏的专门训练，然后秘密地派到苏联境内来进行罪恶活动。
    亚古达和古德利亚弗茨夫详细供述了美国情报机关的作法和目的。
    亚古达走上美国间谍队伍的道路是由于他在对希特勒匪军作战的战场上所表现的怯懦而开始的。由于怯懦的结果亚古达被俘，并为自己祖国的敌人充当奴仆。他忍受着种种摧残，把他由一个地方赶到另一个地方，在苏军乘胜追击的情况下，他和像他一类的人被驱逐到德国的西部边境，在这里他又第二次成了“俘虏”——这次俘虏他们的是美国军队。
    亚古达备述了美国“解放者”如何把所有他们这类人——俄国人，法国人，荷兰人，比利时人，波兰人——像赶牲畜一样用棍子赶上载重汽车；把他们赶进围着铁丝网的家畜栏内，不给吃喝，所有这些措施只是为了一个露骨的目的：使这些人陷于绝望的、把任何出路都看成是得救的境地。
    亚古达在这种处境下，就同意了从慕尼黑来招募苦工的人们的建议。结果他就落在白俄流亡者工头——矛依谢也夫、索矛夫及其他匪徒等的奴役之下，这些人无情地剥削着他们的雇佣者，用他们的手为美国修复前德国的飞机场。
    亚古达就这样由军事俘虏逐渐地变成为“移民”了，也就是变成了没有祖国，没有权利，没有保障的人。
    又经过一个短时期亚古达落到白俄包勒特辽夫的手中，他乃是向南美和非洲贩运“活物”的家伙，亚古达就这样被弄到非洲。
  亚古达说：“苏联人是很难设想到落到这种境地是什么味道儿，当你感到没有保障，没有庇护者，你的身后，没有国家，没有国家的权威来支持你，没有国家的代表使你可以去投奔的那种感觉是什么味道儿”。
    “移民们”在摩洛哥的苦役营中劳动着和死亡着。这个苦役营的最大的股东就是一九一七年由俄国逃到巴黎的别洛谢里斯基公爵。他的同伙人和助手乃是白俄流亡分子非德钦柯，布留诺及其他人等。
   “移民们”在摩洛哥开始受到强烈的反苏训练，给他们灌输一种思想：只有积极参加反苏斗争的人，才能指望成为“出人头地的人”。
    在舞台上又出现了一个叫做白塔拉柯夫的人，他是某一白俄流亡者“协会”的主席。他把自己扮演成同情其同胞遭遇的俄罗斯人，劝他们到西德去，说那里有专门学校，假如他们希望返回苏联，在那里他们可以学到他们所必需的一切。
    亚古达乃是一个不需要费很大唇舌就可以“说服”的人。他是个道德堕落，贪酒如命的人，当白塔拉柯夫充分地满足了他的酒瘾以后，亚古达乃同意到西德去入间谍学校，这个学校就是白塔拉柯夫领导的。亚古达在去德国的途中在巴黎有些耽搁：他在那里在白俄流亡分子——前沙皇部长斯托雷平的儿子的领导下受了一翻“政治磨练”。
    据亚古达称，间谍学校系设立在距美因河上的法兰克福二十公里地方的避暑城巴德航堡。间谍学校是以“苏联研究院”的招牌为掩护的。学校的地址是：凯萨·菲立德立赫·布洛敏纳捷第五七——五九号。这个“学校”在搬到巴德航堡以前是设在里姆堡的。
    学校的教员都是白俄流亡分子和叛徒：校长马尔丁诺是一个老白党流亡分子，沙皇军官的儿子；副校长塔拉索夫也是一个白俄流亡分子；讲授“课程”的人是白塔拉柯夫，巴列木斯基，列德立赫，乌捷痕，奥高劳维奇及其他人等。
    当学校课程结束以后亚古达及其他“学员”都被带到慕尼黑近郊。在施塔尔别尔格尔孜河畔的一所幽静的别墅里有三个美国人接见了他们。其中有一个叫做鹤立杰的人；他的代号叫伊高尔·谢尔格依维奇。
    美国人对送来的人们的履历材料，经过详细地审查。然后在美国人的射击场上进行了各种演习：跳伞、射击。最后亚古达和他的三个旅伴又来到距慕尼黑不远的捷格尔尼孜湖畔的避暑地巴德维塞的一所别墅里。
    亚古达在巴德维塞改名叫“保罗”，那个以后跟他在一起没有分开的青年人得到了“包布”的代号。
    这个青年人就是古德利亚弗茨夫。他的历史比较亚古达稍微简短些。当古德利亚弗茨夫刚满十四岁的时候，他的故乡就被希特勒匪徒临时占领了。那时一些勇敢的苏联青年都选择了与不共戴天的敌人进行斗争的道路，古德利亚弗茨夫胆怯了，屈服于法西斯的宣传，成为占领者的帮凶。在这个堕落的道路上，他也几乎经历了像他年长的伙伴“保罗”——亚古达所走过的一切历程，他也沦落到摩洛哥。当在童子军组织受了训练以后，也出现了那般白塔拉柯夫之类的人，他们把他带到巴得航堡的间谍学校，然后送到捷格尔尼孜湖畔。
    在那里每天向他的脑袋里灌输美国间谍的基本“训条”：仇视与消灭苏联的一切，暗杀和爆破。
    尽管这种经常不断的力图使青年人变成为自觉的反对苏维埃国家的敌人的训练的作用是如何的强烈，但他总还是不止一次地盘算着所发生的一切。引起他这种怀疑的原因就是他由某些与亲人有书信往来的人那里，得来的一星半点的消息，和有时听到的苏联方面关于祖国生活的广播。
    古德利亚弗茨夫说：“我可以断定地说，假若没有美国人经常对‘移民’进行恐吓，制造所谓凡是返回苏联的人必将受到惩处等鬼话，那么许多 ‘移民’早已很高兴地回到自己的家园了”。
    尽管这样，古德利亚弗茨夫——“包布”，也和“保罗”——亚古达一样在巴得维塞的美国“高级”间谍学校忠顺地进行了学习。在这里指导训练的人已不仅是“俄籍”校长巴利斯·巴利斯维奇·马尔丁诺及其他白俄流亡分子，而且还有并不掩饰自己是属于美国情报机关工作人员身份的美国人。其中就有那叫做鹤立杰的上尉，他又名“毕尔”，他也叫“伊高尔·谢尔格依维奇”，他是人所公认的制定向苏联派遣行动破坏分子训令的专家。其他美国教官有的代号叫“沃洛加”“麻柯思”“丹尼”，他们教授的课目则是无线电、密写，辨别苏联飞机和武器的类型，密码通讯以及其他做间谍的技艺。
    美国情报人员最关心的问题之一就是要保证使派往苏联的间谍一旦被破获时，要他们不致供出与美国情报机关的关系。为此目的他们努力使这些受训的人员相信任何想背叛他的美国主人到苏联政权机关自首的人，都免不了要被处死。凡被派到苏联的特务都受到严格警告，要他们在迫不得已时，可以说出他们是白俄组织的特务，实则这些白俄组织也就是美国情报机关的分支。
    这些间谍在巴得维塞美国间谍学校受训完结以后，又重新受了一次试验。考核他们使用电台、密码、密写、武器、地图和市街图的能力。这些试验项目大部分是在美国射击场内进行的。那里有个美国中士报务员对每个受测验的人的拍发无线电手法进行了录音。在这里他们又接受了补充指示，假如在苏联“站住脚”之后，他们要进行破坏党政工作人员、文学和科学的活动家们的威信的工作。书写挑拨性的黑信。
    他们这样进行了两个星期的试验以后，鹤立杰上尉就把这几个训练好的间谍装上汽车带到慕尼黑美国兵营附近的军用仓库里。他们在美军中尉“保罗”的监视下最后配备好由飞机跳伞的一切装备，精细地包装好地图、武器、子弹、电台、密码、苏联钞票等物品；当从所有物品中消灭掉可能被认为是美国出品的任何痕迹或微小的记号，当向他们的衣服里缝好金质硬币时，鹤立杰上尉做了最后的指示。
    在这些指示中又重新重复了以下各点：他肯定的指出倘若在苏联境内被破获时，他们无论如何也不要供出自己是属于美国情报机关系统的特务；鹤立杰并给了他们以“友谊的”劝告：在被破获时为了逃避严重恶果的最好的办法就是服毒自杀。他拿出一个小药针给“保罗”和“包布”看，那里面装着立即可以致死的毒药，这种药针按照他的指示立即缝进他们的衬衣领内。只要他们咬一下衬衫的领子，立刻就会死亡的。
    由慕尼黑终于起飞了。第一段路程是要到希腊的萨罗尼加，护送他们的有美军情报人员哈罗德·欧文·菲德勒少校（“沃洛加”）和另一个少校。在那里把亚古达——“保罗”和古德利亚弗茨夫——“包布”装入一架没有任何标志的四引擎轰炸机里。
    飞机没有任何通常的光亮，在高空飞行着。忽然像箭一般向下穿行。信号灯亮了，这是命令：准备跳伞。两个人都戴好跳伞装备，并最后一次整顿好所带的物品，站在飞机门跟前。由驾驶室走出来的美国人打开了机门闩。在他的背后还站着另一个美国人，皱着眉头看着这两个间谍。
    古德利亚弗茨夫第一个迈到机仓外的漆黑的深渊里。亚古达踌躇了一下，这时一个美国领航军官，用力把他推了下去，他失却平衡，由飞机里掉了下去……
    据亚古达和古德利亚弗茨夫自己供称；从他们降落到苏联国土时起直到他们到苏联国家保安机关自首时止，他们一直感觉到自己没有能力把自己伪装起来，与苏联人民群众混在一起。正是这种可能被识破，被捕获的恐惧心理在不断地驱使他们两个人由这里搬到那里。
    在苏联国土上所处的孤独无援的境地，使他们再也不能忍受了。他们越来越多的感觉到宁愿被人识破也不愿再像两只狼似地四处流窜。亚古达和古德利亚弗茨夫两个人在思想中总是经常回忆起久别的故乡。他们总是常常地想到他们是被美国人拖进了反对苏联人民，也是反对他们自己的勾当中。越来越多地回想到在德国，在非洲所度过的生活，在自己的记忆中时常涌现出那些前沙皇检察官和将军的魔影，鹤立杰的魔影和他的“赠品”——致死的药针。
    他们两个人虽没有互相商量，但行动却完全是一致的，他们都拖延着不与“东尼先生”用电台联系。他们现在记不起来第一次谈起这个问题是如何开始的，但他们终于谈通了：把他们的装备都埋藏起来，利用他们所带来的伪证件找寻工作。起初他们认为谁也不会知道他们的过去，他们手里有钱，又都能工作，可以重新生活起来的。
    但是亚古达和古德利亚弗茨夫对这个计划考虑得越多，他们越清醒地感觉到背着这样沉重的秘密包袱，他们是永久不能正视周围的苏联人，他们永远也不会感到自己是享有一切平等权利的苏联公民。
    当他们明了这点以后，立刻就到他们找到临时掩护的那个城市的保安机关自首了。在那里他们交出了自己的装备，其中包括：短波无线电收发报机，指示飞机着陆的无线电信号机、武器（其中包括无声武器）、密码、加码表、地图、指南针；密写用具；各种苏维埃机关的空白证件；公民证和军役证；由美国情报机关领到的伪造的身份证明文件；苏联钞票和黄金；国外的秘密通信地址。他们应该向这些国外秘密通信地址寄递密码的间谍情报。这些地址是比利时，列日，阿得利安街十一号维特·犹里·布萨尔得；挪威，阿勒维克·卡尔丹格尔，ФМБ·柯拉斯道尔内依；柏林，茨林道尔弗，沃立操根大街十五号，（甘及叔尔曼О·X·Г）。
    他们详细地谈出了从美国情报机关接受的任务。在莫斯科潜伏下来之后，即着手搜集和拍发有关经济与军事目标的情报；吸收特务进行情报与行动性的破坏活动；用写黑信的方式，破坏全国著名人士，党和社会团体的活动家，苏维埃政权工作人员的威信；杀死苏联人，夺取他们的证件；向美国情报中心报告向苏联派遣特务所必须准备的苏联证件；利用无线电信号机指示以后的间谍降陆，在战时帮助敌机轰炸苏联目标。
    亚古达和古德利亚弗茨夫拒绝了执行美国情报机关的任务而自首了，他们不仅未受到像美国情报机关恐吓他们时所说的“处死”，并且得到在自己祖国里自由生活和从事劳动的完全可能。现在他们两个人又重新感觉到他们是自己伟大祖国的儿子。他们努力为苏维埃人民的利益和幸福劳动着。苏联人民把他们由无底深渊里拯救出来，使他们重新回到自己的队伍中，在这个深渊中，至今还有许多不幸的，成为美帝国主义及其罪恶阴谋的牺牲者的“移民”。
