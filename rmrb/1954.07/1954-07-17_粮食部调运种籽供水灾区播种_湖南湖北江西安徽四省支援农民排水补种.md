Xinhua News Agency, 16th: The Ministry of Food has decided to transfer a batch of rice and buckwheat seeds from the Northeast and Beijing and Tianjin to the flood-stricken areas of East China to provide farmers with seeds for replanting after draining water. The rice transferred from the Northeast will be exchanged for grain seeds from farmers in East China. These seeds have now been shipped one after another. There are also many types of vegetables suitable for summer planting in disaster areas, such as Chinese cabbage, radish, and turnips. Relevant departments are actively raising these seeds for planting in disaster areas.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 16th: The state financial departments and cooperatives of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces are supporting farmers in waterlogged and flooded areas with seeds, fertilizers, and loans to drain water, replant, and increase top dressing. As of early July, the grain departments and supply and marketing cooperatives in Hubei Province had supplied farmers with various seeds such as late rice. Changsha County in Hunan Province recently also transported late rice seeds to waterlogged and flooded areas. The preparatory committee of the Hunan Provincial Cooperative has purchased more than 50,000 dan of miscellaneous grain seeds from neighboring provinces, which will be supplied to farmers for replanting successively.

Currently, a fleet of cargo ships loaded with more than 60,000 dan of fertilizer is preparing to sail from Hankou Port to Hunan to support supply and marketing cooperatives in various places to supply farmers in waterlogged and flooded areas with increased top dressing. A few days ago, Hankou Port also transported 10,000 dan of soybean cake to Jiangxi Province for the Jiangxi Provincial Cooperative to support farmers in waterlogged and flooded areas for replanting. The All-China Federation of Cooperatives recently allocated an additional 1,000 tons of chemical fertilizer to the waterlogged and flooded areas of Jiangxi Province.

The Central China Branch of the People's Bank of China recently allocated 100 billion yuan in loans to farmers in waterlogged and flooded areas to enrich farmers' production funds. The Hubei and Hunan branch of the People's Bank of China had temporarily allocated funds and started lending in the affected areas.

After receiving various assistance from state financial departments and cooperatives, farmers in waterlogged and flooded areas of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces have now started draining water and replanting in many areas. Erqu District in Yongxiu County, Jiangxi Province, has replanted more than 70,000 jin of late rice seeds. Farmers in Taiping Township, Cili County, Hunan Province, had replanted 249 mu of millet and other miscellaneous grains by the end of June, with only a small portion of submerged fields not yet replanted.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 14th: Supply and marketing cooperatives and grain departments at all levels in Anhui Province support farmers in flood control, drainage, and replanting. Supply and marketing cooperatives in Wuhu Prefecture supplied farmers with more than 680,000 jin of moso bamboo, more than 200,000 reed mats, and a large number of sacks and timber for flood control. Grain departments have successively collected a large amount of grain to supply farmers in areas along the river, and some places have also established floating warehouses, loading grain on large ships to supply along the Yangtze River. While supplying flood control materials, supply and marketing cooperatives and grain departments have also prepared waterwheels, fertilizers, and seeds of late autumn crops for farmers to drain water and replant. Supply and marketing cooperatives in Anqing Prefecture have supplied farmers with 5,000 waterwheels. The supply and marketing cooperative system in Wuhu Prefecture has organized more than 3,500 woodworking workers to rush to produce 6,000 waterwheels. More than 100 million jin of late autumn crop seeds prepared by grain departments and supply and marketing cooperatives have begun to be transported to flood-stricken areas. More than 10 million jin of fertilizer stored by supply and marketing cooperatives in various places along the Yangtze River has also begun to be supplied to farmers.

    【新华社十六日讯】中央人民政府粮食部决定从东北和北京、天津两市调运一批大米和荞麦的种籽到华东遭受水灾地区，供灾区农民排水抢救后，重新播种。从东北调出的大米由华东区向农民调换谷种。现在这些粮种已经先后起运。适于灾区夏季种植的菜类还有很多，如白菜、萝卜、蔓菁等，有关部门正在积极筹集这些种籽，供灾区种植。
    【新华社武汉十六日电】湖南、湖北、江西三省的国家财经部门和合作社正以种籽、肥料和贷款，支援受涝受淹地区的农民排水补种和增施追肥。到七月上旬止，湖北省粮食部门和供销合作社已供应了农民晚稻等各种种籽。湖南省长沙县最近也把晚稻种籽运到受涝受淹地区。湖南省合作社筹备委员会已在邻省采购杂粮种籽五万多担，将相继供应农民补种。
    目前，汉口港码头有一队货船装载六万多担肥料准备驶往湖南去，支援各地供销合作社供应受涝受淹地区的农民增施追肥。前些日子汉口港还为江西省合作社运出一万担豆饼到江西省去，支援受涝受淹地区农民补种。中华全国合作社联合总社最近增拨化学肥料一千吨给江西省受涝受淹地区。
    中国人民银行中南区行最近拨出一千亿元贷款，贷给受涝受淹地区的农民，充裕农民生产资金。中国人民银行湖北、湖南两省分行曾临时拨出款项，在受涝地区开始贷放。
    湖南、湖北、江西三省受涝受淹地区的农民得到国家财经部门和合作社的各种帮助后，目前许多地区农民多已开始排水补种。江西省永修县二区目前已补种了七万多斤晚稻种，湖南省慈利县太平乡农民六月底已补种了粟米等杂粮二百四十九亩，只差小部分受淹的田没有补种。
    【新华社合肥十四日电】安徽省各级供销合作社和粮食部门支援农民防汛、排涝和补种。芜湖专区各供销合作社供给农民六十八万多斤毛竹，二十多万张芦席以及大批麻袋、木材，作为防汛用。粮食部门陆续调集了大批粮食供应沿江地区的农民，有些地方还建立了水上仓库，把粮食装上大船，沿着长江流动供应。在供应防汛物资的同时，供销合作社和粮食部门还为农民进行排涝、补种工作准备了水车、肥料和晚秋作物的种籽。安庆专区各供销合作社已供应农民五千辆水车。芜湖专区供销合作社系统组织了三千五百多木业工人，正在赶制六千辆水车。粮食部门和供销合作社已准备好的一亿多斤晚秋作物种籽开始运往受涝地区。沿长江各地的供销合作社储备的一千多万斤肥料也开始供应给农民。
