(Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, July 17th) The United States' crude interference in Indonesia's trade with China is arousing increasingly strong dissatisfaction in all circles of Indonesia.

Indonesia's First Deputy Prime Minister, Wongsonagoro, recently told a reporter from "Quan Yuan Bao" that if the United States exerts pressure to force Indonesia to stop selling rubber to the People's Republic of China, Indonesia will not accept such pressure and will pursue an independent foreign policy.

Gikkwan, chairman of the Economic Subcommittee of the Indonesian Parliament, reiterated at a press conference on the 15th regarding the U.S. threat to apply the "Battle Act" to Indonesia, stating that Indonesia should not be intimidated by U.S. threats, as that would violate the fundamental principles of Indonesia's independent foreign policy. He said, "It is unreasonable to ask Indonesia to only sell raw materials to one side." He also said that if Indonesia continues to implement the "embargo," it will lose a good market for selling its raw materials.

Indonesian newspapers have widely published this news. Newspaper headlines read: "Not Afraid of the Battle Act," "Indonesia Must Seek Broader Markets," "Indonesia Should Disregard Threats and Sell Its Goods to Anyone."

Indonesia's "People's Daily" published an editorial on the 16th, stating that Gikkwan's statement expressed the demands and aspirations of Indonesian industrialists and businessmen of all sizes. The newspaper called for implementing an independent policy based on equality and mutual benefit.

"Quan Yuan Bao" recently said that it would be very beneficial to sell a large amount of rubber to the People's Republic of China.

"Social Messenger" stated on the 16th that due to the United States' implementation of hegemonic and selfish policies, the United States is becoming increasingly unpopular, both in the West and the East, including Indonesia. The United States' demand that Indonesia not sell rubber to China is unacceptable to Indonesians of any class. The newspaper emphasized that if the United States continues to implement this policy, disregarding the opinions and development of Asian countries, it will suffer dire consequences.

    印尼各界不满美国干涉印尼和中国的贸易
    【新华社雅加达十七日电】美国粗暴地干涉印尼对中国的贸易一事，正在引起印尼各界越来越强烈的不满。
    印尼政府第一副总理旺梭尼哥罗最近对“泉源报”记者说，如果美国施加压力来强迫阻止印尼出售橡胶给中华人民共和国的话，印尼将不接受这样的压力，而实行独立的外交政策。
    印尼国会经济小组委员会主席吉克万十五日在记者招待会上就美国威胁对印尼施用“巴特尔法”问题再次发表声明说，印尼不应该被美国的威胁所吓倒，因为那将是违背印尼的独立外交政策的基本原则的。他说：“要印尼只出卖原料给某一方，这是不合理的。”他并说，如果印尼继续执行“禁运”，它就会丧失销售它的原料的良好市场。
    印尼报纸广泛刊载这些消息。报纸的标题写道：“不怕巴特尔法”，“印尼必需寻求较广阔的市场”，“印尼应该不管威胁，对谁都出售它的货物”。
    印尼“人民日报”十六日发表社论说，吉克万的声明表达了印尼大小工商业人士的要求和愿望。报纸要求以平等互利为基础，实行独立的政策。
    “泉源报”最近说：如果能够把大量橡胶卖给中华人民共和国的话，那将是很有利的。
    “社会使者报”十六日说，由于美国实行专横的和自私自利的政策，无论在西方或东方，包括印尼在内，美国越来越不受欢迎了。美国要求印尼不卖橡胶给中国，这是任何阶层的印尼人都不会接受的。报纸强调指出，美国如果继续实行这种政策，不顾亚洲国家的意见和亚洲国家的发展，将遭到恶果。
