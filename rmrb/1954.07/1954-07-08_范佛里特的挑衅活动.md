    Van Fleet's Provocative Activities
    Former commander of the U.S. Eighth Army in Korea, Van Fleet, upon the orders of the U.S. government, has recently engaged in a series of provocative and conspiratorial activities in the Far East. He has been scurrying back and forth between Washington, Tokyo, Seoul, and Taiwan, holding secret talks with Yoshida, Syngman Rhee, Chiang Kai-shek, and U.S. military leaders in the Far East, inspecting the training and equipment of U.S. puppet troops, and investigating the U.S.’s “military needs” in the Far East. Clearly, Van Fleet is carrying out important preparatory work for Washington in continuing to pursue a policy of hostility toward the People's Republic of China and creating tension in Asia.
    Western news agencies have revealed that after Van Fleet's meeting with Syngman Rhee, the United States is preparing to expand Syngman Rhee's ground forces on a larger scale, providing jet fighters and large warships, and providing $300 million in military "aid" annually. At the same time, it is said that U.S. President Eisenhower has invited Syngman Rhee to the United States for talks to discuss the Syngman Rhee group's plan to unify Korea by force on a "broader basis of the Far East defense strategy." This clearly illustrates what Van Fleet is up to in South Korea.
    Van Fleet's three visits to Taiwan further expose the U.S.'s ambition to collude with the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to invade China. Van Fleet conducted an "investigation" of the military facilities on Taiwan and other islands occupied by the Chiang bandits, shamelessly declaring that "the information brought back to the United States this time is extremely rich."
    When leaving Taiwan, Van Fleet openly stated that there "should be a bilateral common security treaty" between the United States and the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, just like the treaties signed by the United States and other puppet groups in the Far East. Western news agencies also revealed that Van Fleet may suggest expanding the operational scope of the U.S. Seventh Fleet to certain islands near the Chinese coast. Obviously, the U.S. warmongering clique is attempting to fix its crime of occupying and controlling Taiwan in the form of a treaty, so as to more unscrupulously use this military base and its fostered Chiang bandit gang to be forever hostile to our country, threatening and undermining peace in the Far East. The United States and Japan, and the United States and South Korea, have all signed military treaties. The reason why the United States wants to sign a similar treaty with the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang is also to facilitate pulling Taiwan into an aggressive group including Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, in order to promote the U.S. plan of "using Asians to fight Asians."
    As everyone knows, since the Geneva Conference, an increasing number of Western countries have been demanding to improve their relations with the People's Republic of China and to restore and develop their economic and cultural exchanges with the People's Republic of China. Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to India and Burma has further strengthened the friendship between our country and India and Burma, as well as with Southeast Asian countries. All peace-loving people in Asia and the world are cheering for this, believing that peace in Asia is becoming more and more secure. This wish is entirely legitimate and reasonable. However, the U.S. ruling clique has adopted a diametrically opposite stance and is desperately resisting this legitimate and reasonable wish of peace-loving people in various countries. Van Fleet's activities in Taiwan to further support and collude with the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang once again fully demonstrate that the U.S. ruling clique is extremely hostile to the People's Republic of China, extremely fearful of the normalization of international relations, and stubbornly adheres to its reactionary policy that ignores reality.
    Van Fleet's provocative activities in the Far East cannot but arouse great vigilance and anger among the Chinese people, and at the same time, they cannot but arouse strong opposition from peace-loving people in Asia and around the world. The peace-loving Chinese people, together with the people of all countries, are determined and have the strength to defend the peace and security of China and Asia. If the U.S. warmongering clique dares to sign any "bilateral common security treaty" with the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, who is abandoned by everyone, to antagonize the great Chinese people to the end, and to antagonize the people of all countries and the governments of many countries who are striving to ease world tensions, it will be further isolating itself from the people of the world and will surely receive the most serious consequences it deserves.

### 范佛里特的挑衅活动

    范佛里特的挑衅活动
    前侵朝美军第八军军长范佛里特奉美国政府之命，最近期间到远东进行了一连串挑衅性的阴谋活动。他匆匆忙忙地往返于华盛顿、东京、汉城和台湾之间，与吉田、李承晚、蒋介石和远东美军首脑举行了秘密会谈，视察了美国傀儡军的训练和装备情况，并调查了美国在远东的“军事需要”。很显然，范佛里特是在替华盛顿继续推行敌视中华人民共和国和在亚洲制造紧张局势的政策，从事重要的准备工作。
    西方通讯社透露，范佛里特和李承晚会谈后，美国正准备更大规模地扩充李承晚的地面部队，给予喷气式战斗机和大型军舰，并给予每年三亿美元的军事“援助”。同时，据说美国总统艾森豪威尔已邀请李承晚赴美举行会谈，将在美国
  “远东防御战略的更广泛的基础上”，讨论李承晚集团武力统一朝鲜的计划。这就清楚地说明范佛里特在南朝鲜是干的什么勾当了。
    范佛里特三度到台湾的活动，更进一步地暴露了美国勾结蒋介石匪帮侵略中国的野心。范佛里特对于蒋匪盘踞的台湾及其他岛屿的军事设备，进行了“调查”，恬不知耻地宣称“此次携返美国之资料极为丰富”。
    范佛里特在离开台湾的时候公然表示，美国及台湾蒋介石匪帮之间“应有一项共同安全双边条约”，正同美国和远东其他傀儡集团所签订的条约一样。西方通讯社并透露，范佛里特可能建议把美国第七舰队的活动范围扩大到邻近中国海岸的某些岛屿。很显然，美国好战集团竟企图把它侵占和控制台湾的罪行用条约形式固定下来，以便更无顾忌地利用这个军事基地及其所豢养的蒋匪帮，来永远与我国为敌，威胁和破坏远东和平。现在美国和日本，美国和南朝鲜，都订有军事条约，美国所以要和台湾蒋介石匪帮订立同样的条约，也是为了便于把台湾拉进包括日本、南朝鲜和台湾的侵略集团，以推行美国“用亚洲人打亚洲人”的计划。
    大家知道，自从日内瓦会议以来，越来越多的西方国家都要求改善它们和中华人民共和国的关系，并恢复和发展它们和中华人民共和国的经济与文化交流。我国周恩来总理访问印度缅甸之行，使我国与印缅两国以及与东南亚各国的邦交更加敦睦。全亚洲和全世界爱好和平的人民正为此欢欣鼓舞，认为亚洲和平是愈加有了保障了。这种愿望完全是正当合理的。但是美国统治集团却对此采取截然相反的立场，而且拚命地和各国爱好和平的人民的这种正当合理的愿望相对抗。范佛里特到台湾所进行的进一步扶植和勾结蒋介石匪帮的阴谋活动，就再次充分证明了美国统治集团极端敌视中华人民共和国，极端恐惧国际关系的正常化，而死硬地坚持其不顾现实的反动政策。
    范佛里特到远东的这些挑衅活动，不得不引起中国人民的极大警惕和愤怒，同时也不能不引起亚洲及世界各国爱好和平的人民的强烈反对。爱好和平的中国人民和各国人民一起，是决心并有力量保卫中国及亚洲的和平与安全的。美国好战集团如果胆敢与人所共弃的蒋介石匪帮订立什么“共同安全双边条约”，要同伟大的中国人民作对到底，同正在争取缓和世界紧张局势的各国人民和许多国家的政府作对到底，那就是进一步自绝于天下之人，必将得到它所应得的最严重的后果。
