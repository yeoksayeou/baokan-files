    The State Guarantees and Encourages Scientific Research
    Two Different Fates of Superior Varieties
    During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, the people's livelihood was not guaranteed, and those engaged in scientific research often suffered persecution. Zhou Shilu, deputy director of the East China Agricultural Science Institute, had engaged in agricultural scientific research and teaching for more than 20 years in the old society and had personally witnessed many people engaged in scientific research being forced to leave the laboratory and seek other ways to make a living due to life's pressures. Before liberation, Zhou Shilu had to sell his beloved books at old bookstores with tears in his eyes because of the pressure of life. His four-year-old child saw it and asked him, "Dad, where are you taking the books?" Before Zhou Shilu could speak, he was overcome with sadness, and tears welled up in his eyes.
    Under very difficult material conditions, Zhou Shilu and his colleagues still worked tirelessly on their research work, hoping to achieve something. They selected and bred high-yielding, good varieties such as "Improved Dongguan White," "Improved Jiangning Yangxian," and "Hat Head," and formulated the "Rice Local Variety Inspection Method" to comprehensively improve varieties. However, in the old society, where the reactionary Morgan theory dominated, these methods were unfeasible. "Zhongnong No. 4" and "Victory Xian" were also selected and bred before liberation, but they were not widely promoted among farmers until after liberation. This shows that only under the people's democratic system can science have infinitely broad prospects for development.
    With the help of the People's Government, in recent years, the East China Agricultural Science Institute has added new scientific instruments such as microscopes and magnifying glasses. The dilapidated greenhouses of the past have now been repaired, and darkrooms, icehouses, and staff dormitories have also been added. People who have achieved success in scientific research have been commended and rewarded by the state. In January of this year alone, the East China Agricultural Technology Conference rewarded more than 20 successful scientific research projects.
    The draft constitution clearly stipulates that citizens have the freedom to conduct scientific research, which has brought greater impetus to scientific research.
    The Sincere Experiences of Scientific Workers
    Liang Boqiang, professor and director of the Pathology Department of South China Medical College, was very excited after studying the draft constitution.
    He believes that this draft constitution is essentially different from the constitutions of the past Kuomintang reactionary government and the current capitalist countries. The constitutions of capitalist countries are completely for the service of the bourgeoisie. The so-called "democracy" and "civil rights" written in the articles are all deceptive. Before liberation, he visited the United States and saw a large number of unemployed residents lining up in front of a Catholic church near Wall Street in New York every noon, waiting for alms, while the millionaires of Wall Street lived in luxury and corruption in tall buildings. According to a person in charge of the church, some of the unemployed people were doctors and engineers who had no way to make a living after losing their jobs and had to go there to wait for alms. The American constitution not only does not guarantee scientific workers, but even persecutes them under the pretext of various reasons. The death sentence imposed on the Rosenbergs by the US government last year is a clear example.
    During the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, scientific work was also not guaranteed; not only was it not respected, but sometimes it encountered unexpected troubles. Liang Boqiang is a pathologist. Before liberation, when he was still teaching at Tongji University Medical College in Shanghai, he once conducted a corpse dissection. A Kuomintang reactionary officer colluded with hooligans, posing as the family members of the deceased, to make trouble, extort money in every possible way, and demand huge sums of money. Later, he was unable to gain a foothold in Shanghai and had to go to Guangzhou to teach in the spring of 1932. However, at the former Zhongshan University Medical College under the rule of the reactionaries, scientific work was equally without prospects.
    After liberation, the situation completely changed. Liang Boqiang said: "Scientific work has achieved rapid development with the encouragement and help of the Communist Party and the People's Government. Taking the pathological teaching work in which I participate as an example, because teaching and research work has developed rapidly, the original buildings, equipment, and personnel are not enough. The People's Government expanded new buildings, added instruments, and hired more teachers last year. This is something that I have never seen and is impossible in the past 30 years."
    Liang Boqiang also said: "Because we have the care and help of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the training of talents and inspection and research work have developed rapidly. For example, before liberation, I taught at Zhongshan University Medical College for nearly 20 years, and less than ten pathology teachers were trained, while after liberation, we trained dozens of teachers for medical colleges across the country every year. The inspection and research materials sent by various hospitals were only more than 2,000 cases of living tissue examination and more than 100 cases of corpse dissection every year before liberation. Now, the living tissue examination has increased to more than 10,000 cases every year, and the corpse dissection has increased to 600 cases every year. These constantly increasing materials have enriched our research content, improved our teaching quality, and made it possible for us to gradually complete the task of training talents. From these facts, I realize the great significance of the draft constitution for scientific workers."
    Creating a Good Working Environment
    Fan Ximeng, a researcher at the Institute of Industrial Chemistry of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, worked in Yumen for many years during the rule of the Kuomintang. At that time, the reactionary government relied on imperialist countries for everything. It did not even believe that Chinese scientific workers could evaluate crude oil and sent it to the United States for research. Fan Ximeng said: "This is something that any upright scientific worker cannot but be angry and resentful about."
    Fan Ximeng and his colleagues painstakingly studied various issues and wrote papers, but he never saw anyone's paper being adopted by the reactionary government. In 1944 and 1945, he studied "oil diffusion vacuum pump oil" in Chongqing. He worked tirelessly and finally succeeded in his research. He submitted the paper, but he never heard back. He said: "The destruction of scientific workers in old China is more than that. Many professors and experts could not even get enough to eat, how could they engage in scientific research work! At that time, they would be unemployed after graduating from university. Even those who had already taken up scientific research work positions could not stand the destruction, and many of them changed careers halfway. This is what scientific workers 'enjoyed' in old China."
    Fan Ximeng believes that only in the new China can scientific workers obtain the right and freedom to engage in scientific research.
    He said: "Our country respects scientific workers very much - this is what I have personally felt in recent years. Our country does everything possible to create a good working environment for us - providing sufficient instruments and abundant books. When we encounter difficulties, we will definitely get help from the country. In our country, scientific workers have broad prospects, and every research work of ours directly serves socialist construction. Whenever we see that something researched by us has contributed to the country, we feel immense joy." In 1947, he and his colleagues discovered a problem in oil refining in Yumen - salt in the oil wells (crude oil desalination), which seriously corroded the machines. They believed that this problem must be solved, and in fact, it could be solved. However, the corrupt Kuomintang government did not rely on them but sent the oil to the United States for research and bought goods from the United States to "solve" this problem. He said: "But today, our scientific workers have gained the country's supreme trust, and the country has handed this major problem over to us. And our scientific workers have used collective wisdom and strength to solve this problem."
    Fan Ximeng feels that everything in the country is related to him, and he feels a kind of motivation pushing him everywhere. He said: "Chinese scientific workers have never engaged in scientific research work with such high confidence and enthusiasm as they do today, contributing their wisdom and strength."
    Seeing Article 95 of the draft constitution, Fan Ximeng felt infinitely excited. He is willing to contribute all his strength to the motherland and work hard for the construction of a socialist society.
    Unreservedly Dedicate Technology
    Lan Tian, an engineer at the Southwest Design Branch of the Central Ministry of Railways, is a 67-year-old railway engineering technician. He said: "In the old society, the reactionary rulers also created 'constitutions,' but those so-called constitutions were only for consolidating the reactionary regime and maintaining the interests of a few people; what they brought to the people was only pain and disaster. The current constitution is the fundamental law for guaranteeing the people's rights and is the people's constitution."
    Before liberation, Lan Tian worked on the railway for more than 30 years, and he was squeezed out everywhere. He had technology but no place to use it. After liberation, he participated in railway work and has always received the country's care and attention. In the work of measuring lines on the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway and the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, he received the support of the leaders for putting forward rationalization proposals, saving wealth for the country. In the survey of the Chengdu-Kunming Railway, he personally waded through mountains and rivers. Although the road was difficult, he was very happy because he felt that he was doing something meaningful for the motherland and the people. He said: "Now is the time when one's own wishes and the requirements of the country are closely combined. Facts have proved that only when the people have grasped political power can technology truly serve the people, and engineering technicians can have infinitely bright prospects. In the future, I must continue to work hard to improve my political level, learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, unreservedly hand over my technology, train young comrades, and contribute all my strength to the country's socialist industrialization!" Glorious Task
    Zhang Jinsheng is an engineering technician in a factory in Shenyang. During the rule of the reactionaries, his life was very unstable, so he had no intention of studying technology and making inventions. After liberation, he improved his political consciousness, enjoyed the rights of a citizen, and his life was guaranteed. At the same time, the broad masses of workers were looking for tricks, tapping potential, putting forward rationalization proposals, and carrying out technical innovation movements, which provided favorable conditions for engineering technicians to give full play to their technical skills.
    Zhang Jinsheng's job is basic construction. He feels that to do his job well, he must learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. Last year, he learned from the Soviet Union's forced-circulation hot water heating installation experience. In the construction of dormitories with more than 80,000 square meters, he saved more than 1.3 billion yuan and completed the civil engineering construction 16 and a half days ahead of schedule, changing the situation that the completion time of water heating projects was always behind the civil engineering construction. In order to accelerate the process of national industrialization, he is determined to continue to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. At present, he is studying the Soviet method of industrializing water heating installation, and a prefabrication factory has been established in combination with the specific conditions of the construction site. In addition, he is also conducting research to gradually move water heating installation towards semi-mechanization and mechanization, changing manual operation methods. The iron plate cutting machine and the iron plate rolling machine are also under research. The electric threading machine, which was successfully researched last year, has been officially put into production.
    After seeing the draft constitution, Zhang Jinsheng realized more deeply that contributing all his technology and strength to the cause of socialist construction in the motherland is a glorious task and a duty. He expressed that he would guarantee to do his job well in his own post and strive to complete this year's plan ahead of schedule.

    国家保障和鼓励科学研究工作
    优良品种的两个不同命运
    国民党反动统治时期，人民生活没有保障，进行科学研究的人往往遭受迫害。华东农业科学研究所副所长周拾禄在旧社会里做了二十多年农业科学研究和教学工作，曾经亲眼看到很多从事科学研究的人被生活所迫，不得不走出试验室，另想别的办法谋生。解放以前周拾禄为生活所迫，不得不含着眼泪把心爱的几本书拿到旧书摊上去卖。他四岁的孩子看见了，问他：“爸爸，你把书拿到哪里去？”周拾禄话还没有讲出来，一阵心酸，眼泪就夺眶而出了。
    在物质条件很困难的情况下，周拾禄和同伴们仍然不倦地努力于自己的研究工作，希望能有所成就：他们选育了“改良东莞白”、“改良江宁洋籼”和“帽子头”等高产量的优良品种；拟定了“水稻地方品种检查方法”，以求全面提高品种，但是在摩尔根反动学说占统治地位的旧社会里，这些办法是行不通的。“中农四号”和“胜利籼”也早在解放以前就选育出来了，但是直到解放以后才在广大农民中得到普遍的推广。这说明了只有在人民民主制度下，科学才有无限广阔的发展前途。
    在人民政府帮助下，几年来华东农业科学研究所增添了显微镜、扩大镜等新的科学仪器，过去破烂不堪的温室现在也修好了，还增加了暗室、冰库和职工宿舍。在科学研究上有成就的人都受到国家的表扬和奖励，仅在今年一月份华东农业技术会议上就奖励了二十多项有成就的科学研究工作。
    宪法草案明确规定了公民有进行科学研究的自由权利，给科学研究工作带来了更大的推动力量。
    科学工作者的亲切体会
    华南医学院病理科主任教授梁伯强学了宪法草案后，非常兴奋。
    他认为这个宪法草案和过去国民党反动政府和目前各资本主义国家的宪法有本质上的不同。资本主义国家的宪法是完全为资产阶级服务的，条文上写着的所谓“民主”和“公民权利”，都是骗人的。解放以前他到美国参观，看见纽约华尔街附近的一间天主教堂门前，每天中午有大批失业居民在那里排队等候施食，而华尔街的百万富翁们却高踞高楼大厦，过着豪华、腐化的生活。据该教堂的一个办事人告诉他，失业人群中有些人是做过医师和工程师的，因为失了业无法度日只得到那里去等候施食。美国的宪法，对科学工作者不仅没有保障，甚至还要借故迫害他们。去年美国政府判处罗森堡夫妇死刑，就是明显的例子。
    在国民党反动派统治时期，科学工作也是没有保障的；不但不受到尊重，有时还会遭遇意料不到的麻烦。梁伯强是病理学工作者，解放以前他还在上海同济大学医学院任教时，有一次进行病尸解剖，国民党反动军官勾结流氓，冒充病尸家属来捣乱，多方恐吓，勒索巨款。后来他在上海无法立足，只得于一九三二年春到广州任教。但当时在反动派统治下的前中山大学医学院，科学工作同样是没有前途的。
    解放以后，情况完全改变了。梁伯强说：“科学工作在共产党和人民政府的鼓励和帮助之下，获得迅速的发展。即以我所参加的病理教学工作来说，因为教学和研究工作迅速发展，以致原有建筑、设备和人员都不够用。人民政府去年就扩建了新楼，添置了仪器，加聘了教师。这是我在过去三十年中没有见过、也是不可能有的事情。”
    梁伯强又说：“因为我们有共产党和人民政府的关怀与帮助，所以培养人才和检验研究工作获得迅速的发展。例如解放前我在中山大学医学院任教将近二十年，培养出的病理学师资不到十人，而在解放以后我们为全国各医学院培养的师资，每年就有几十人。各医院送来的检验研究材料，解放前每年仅有两千余例的活体检验和百余例的病尸解剖，现在，活体检验增到每年万余例，病尸解剖每年增到六百余例。这些不断增加的材料，丰富了我们的研究内容，提高了我们的教学质量，使我们有可能逐步完成培养人才的任务。从这些事实，我体会到宪法草案对于科学工作者的重大意义。”
    创造良好的工作环境
    中国科学院工业化学研究所研究员范希孟，在国民党统治时期曾在玉门工作过多年。那时候，反动政府不管什么都要依赖帝国主义国家，甚至连原油评价也不相信中国科学工作者能够做，把它送到美国去研究。范希孟说：“这是任何一个正直的科学工作者都不能不气愤和痛恨的。”
    范希孟和同伴们苦心地研究各种问题，作论文，可是他从来也没有看见谁的论文被反动政府采纳过。一九四四年和一九四五年他在重庆研究“油扩散式真空气泵油液”，他不顾一切地努力工作，终于把它研究成功了。他把论文交了上去，可是以后他再也没听到回音。他说：“旧中国对科学工作者的摧残还不止于此。有许多教授、专家还吃不饱饭，哪能去从事科学研究工作呢！当时从大学毕业就得失业。就是那些已经走上了科学研究工作岗位的人，也因为受不了摧残，有很多都中途转业了。这就是科学工作者在旧中国所‘享受’到的东西。”
    范希孟认为，只有在新中国，科学工作者才获得了从事科学研究的权利和自由。
    他说：“我们国家非常尊重科学工作者——这是我几年来亲身感到的。我们国家尽一切力量为我们创造良好的工作环境——供给充足的仪器和丰富的书籍。当我们遇到困难时，就一定能得到国家的帮助。在我们国家里，科学工作者有广阔的前途，我们每一项研究工作都是直接为社会主义建设服务的。当我们每次看到由我们研究出来的东西对国家有了贡献，就感到莫大的欢欣。”一九四七年，他和同伴们在玉门发现了炼油中的一个问题——油井有盐（原油脱盐），它严重地腐蚀着机器，他们认为这是非解决不可的问题，事实上也能够解决它，但腐败的国民党政府却不依靠他们，而把油送到美国去研究，又从美国买来商品“解决”这个问题。他说：“但是今天，我们科学工作者获得了国家的无上信任，国家把这个重大的问题交给了我们。而我们科学工作者也就用了集体的智慧和力量，把这个问题解决了。”
    范希孟觉得国家的一切事情都和自己有关，处处感到有一种动力在推动着他。他说：“中国的科学工作者从来没有像在今天这样以高度的信心和热情来从事科学研究工作，贡献自己的智慧和力量。”
    看到宪法草案第九十五条，范希孟感到无限兴奋。他愿意把所有的力量贡献给祖国，为建设社会主义社会而努力。
    毫无保留地把技术献出来
    中央铁道部西南设计分局工程师蓝田，是一个六十七岁的铁路工程技术人员。他说：“在旧社会里，反动统治者也曾经制造过‘宪法’，可是那所谓宪法，只是为了巩固反动政权，维护少数人的利益；它带给人民的，只是痛苦和灾难。现在的宪法，才是保障人民权利的根本法，才是人民的宪法。”
    解放以前，蓝田在铁路上干了三十多年，到处受排挤，有技术没有地方用得上。解放以后，他参加了铁路工作，一直受到国家的关心和重视。他在成渝铁路和宝成铁路参加测定线路的工作中，由于提出了合理化建议，得到领导的支持，为国家节约了财富。在成昆铁路的勘测中，他亲自跋山涉水，虽然道路艰苦，但是他很愉快，因为他觉得为祖国和人民做了有意义的事。他说：“现在才是自己的愿望和国家的要求密切结合的时候。事实证明，只有人民掌握了政权，技术才真正能为人民服务，工程技术人员才能有无限光明的前途。今后，我要不断努力提高政治水平，学习苏联先进经验，把自己的技术毫无保留地交出来，培养年轻的同志，为国家的社会主义工业化而贡献出自己的一切力量！”光荣的任务
    张金声是沈阳某工厂的工程技术人员，在反动派统治时期，他的生活很不安定，那有心思钻研技术和发明创造。解放以后，他提高了政治觉悟，享受了公民的权利，生活也有了保障。同时，广大职工到处找窍门，挖潜力，提合理化建议，开展技术革新运动，为工程技术人员发挥技术本领提供了有利条件。
    张金声的工作岗位是基本建设。他觉得要作好自己的工作，必须学习苏联先进经验。他去年学习苏联强制式循环温水法的水暖安装经验，在修建八万多平方公尺的宿舍的工程中，节省了十三亿多元，而且比土木建筑工程提前十六天半完成，改变了水暖工程的完工时间一向落后于土木建筑工程的情况。为了加速国家工业化的进程，他下决心要继续学习苏联先进经验。目前，他正在研究苏联水暖安装工厂化的方法，结合工地具体情况，已经成立起来一个预制厂；此外，他还在进行使水暖安装逐步走向半机械化与机械化的研究，改变手工操作方法；铁板切断机和铁板卷筒机，也在研究中。去年研究成功的电动套丝机已经正式进行生产了。
    看到了宪法草案之后，张金声更深刻地认识到：在祖国社会主义建设事业中，贡献出自己一切的技术和力量，是光荣的任务，也是应尽的义务。他表示要在自己的工作岗位上保证做好工作，并争取提前完成今年的计划。
