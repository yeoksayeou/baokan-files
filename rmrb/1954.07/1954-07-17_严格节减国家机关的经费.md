Strictly Reduce the Expenses of State Organs
Wang Ziying

    The recent report on the 1954 national budget, passed by the Central People's Government Committee, pointed out: "Reducing the expenses of state organs and streamlining state administrative structures is an important method for the state to accumulate industrialization funds." This is one of the long-term and important policies of the Party and the government for realizing socialist industrialization, and an important guarantee for the successful completion of the 1954 national budget.

    The Party and the People's Government have always attached great importance to reducing the expenses of state organs and streamlining state administrative structures. As early as 1942, when the War of Resistance Against Japan was in a difficult period, Chairman Mao put forward the "extremely important policy" of streamlining administration and troops to all liberated areas. Chairman Mao specifically pointed out: "In this streamlining of administration and troops, we must achieve the five goals of streamlining, unification, efficiency, economy, and opposition to bureaucracy. These five items are extremely important to our economic and financial work. After streamlining, the reduction of consumptive expenditures and the increase in productive income will not only directly give finance a good influence, but also reduce the burden on the people and affect the people's economy." The liberated areas resolutely implemented this policy, overcame the difficulties at that time, and finally defeated the enemy. After the liberation of the mainland, in 1950, the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government promulgated the "Decision on Unifying National Financial and Economic Work," established the National Establishment Committee, formulated the staffing of personnel, horses, vehicles, etc. for military and political organs at all levels, and effectively rectified the chaotic phenomenon in the staffing of state organs at that time. In June of the same year, Chairman Mao, in his report at the Third Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, pointed out again that "a substantial reduction in the expenses required by state organs" was one of the three conditions for achieving a fundamental improvement in the entire financial and economic situation. After the concerted efforts of the entire Party and the entire people, coupled with correct measures in all aspects of financial and economic work, a fundamental improvement in the state's financial and economic situation was achieved in less than three years. In the four years since the founding of the Central People's Government, the work of streamlining state organs has also been continuously carried out. The small county and district system that was adapted to the war period in the past has gradually been merged into large counties and large districts, the township-level government has been rebuilt, and some towns and cities have been abolished and merged. This year, it was also decided to uniformly abolish the Greater Administrative Area structure and merge several provinces and cities. The staffing quotas and quota ratios of national administrative and cultural and educational institutions have gradually been revised. The proportion of national administrative expenses in the total national budget expenditure has decreased from 19.3 percent in 1950 to 9.5 percent in 1954. All these measures have not only effectively saved a large amount of administrative expenses for the state and improved the efficiency of the work of the organs, but also created conditions for the state to realize socialist expanded reproduction, accumulate industrialization funds, reduce non-productive personnel, and enrich the state's economic construction institutions.

    However, at present, many departments and localities have not paid enough attention to the work of reducing the expenses of state organs and streamlining state administrative structures. The establishment management agencies and financial departments at all levels have not conducted systematic inspections of the above-mentioned work and put forward constructive opinions, and there are still some shortcomings in the work. As Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping pointed out in his report on the draft national budget for 1954:

  "In the past, there were still unreasonable phenomena in the staffing and quotas for economic construction undertakings and cultural and educational undertakings," "In state organs, there are still large institutions, multiple levels, and redundant personnel. Some departments or units still have extravagant and wasteful expenses." For example, some directly affiliated bureaus of the Central People's Government departments do not have subordinate institutions under vertical leadership, and are only a component of the ministry, but they are staffed according to independent organizational structures, with a large number of personnel, and the staffing ratio of business personnel and service personnel is very inappropriate. In some bureaus, service personnel account for as much as 30 percent of the total number of people in the organ. Some ministries of the Central People's Government have too many organizational links, some of which are unnecessary and can be reduced. The phenomenon of arbitrarily exceeding the establishment and increasing personnel without following state regulations is still very serious. For example, the Shandong Coal Mine Administration of the Central Ministry of Fuel Industry budgeted for 540 people this year, exceeding the establishment at the beginning of last year by 130 people. The Shandong Trade Bureau of the Central Ministry of Foreign Trade increased from 90 people at the end of last year to 135 people, exceeding the established number by 45 people. The control of staffing and positions by various departments and regions is also very insufficient. For example, the proportion of staff and children in Tianjin Nursery is 1:1.25, almost one adult taking care of one child. The prescribed ratio of faculty and staff to students in the city's political school is 1:10, but the actual implementation is 1:5, exceeding it by one time. The original regulation for the Rehe Mala farm implement factory was that each person cultivates an average of 8 hectares, but in reality, each person only cultivates 2 hectares. The central government stipulates that the ratio of faculty and staff to students in colleges and universities is 1:3.5, while the Central South Conservatory of Music is 1:1.59, and the South China Agricultural College is 1:1.9. In addition, the phenomenon of blindly increasing institutions without considering actual conditions, resulting in waste, is also widespread. For example, the Xikang Province film projection team expanded from 10 teams to 23 teams last year, but because there were not enough projectors, 6 teams could not work. Many organs and units also have varying degrees of extravagance and waste in procurement and construction.

    The shortcomings that currently exist in the use of state funds by state organs have, to a certain extent, affected the concentrated use of state industrialization funds, increased the burden on the state, wasted manpower, and fostered bureaucracy. This unreasonable situation urgently needs to be rectified and improved. How can we carry out the work of reducing the expenses of state organs and streamlining state administrative structures?

    First, we must effectively streamline institutions and appropriately reduce staffing to improve work efficiency and tighten up the expenses of organs. At present, some overlapping and dispensable institutions in state organs must be appropriately reduced or merged. The situation in which some organs have overstaffing, setting up positions for people, and staff members only work for half a day or have nothing to do all day is no longer allowed to exist. In order to make the best use of talents and let everyone have their place, these surplus personnel must be transferred to departments that need cadres. Stalin once pointed out: "We must streamline and rectify our state and cooperative organs, our people's committees, and the organs that implement economic accounting, from the bottom up. The huge staffing and unparalleled extravagance of our management organs have become a common topic of conversation. No wonder Lenin repeated dozens and hundreds of times that workers and peasants cannot tolerate the bloated structure and huge expenses of our state organs, and we must use all means and methods to streamline them." This means that we must take all effective measures to conscientiously implement the work of streamlining institutions. The conservative and departmentalist thinking of some organs and units that are unwilling to resolutely streamline the institutions and personnel that should and can be streamlined should be overcome. In fact, reducing unnecessary institutions and personnel will not weaken the work efficiency of the organs. On the contrary, if we can improve the leadership of the organs, reduce internal levels, and give full play to the enthusiasm of the masses, it will increase the work efficiency of the organs. The worry that reducing personnel will affect work is unnecessary.

    Second, strictly control staffing and implement staffing quotas. According to the different nature of national regions, institutions at all levels, and various units, formulating staffing quotas and necessary standards for the use of real objects and financial expenditures from the bottom up that are both practical and in line with the principle of economy is a task that cannot be ignored at present. This is not enough; we must further implement the determination of positions, and there must also be a regulation on the staffing of various institutions. For past overstaffed personnel, they must be strictly distinguished and gradually resolved appropriately. Some past expenditures that did not meet the quota should be gradually corrected. Any organ or individual must adhere to the regulation that personnel staffing cannot be increased without the approval of the Central Establishment Committee. Make the national establishment truly a law and regulation that is universally observed throughout the country.

    Third, we must carry out unremitting struggle against all extravagance and waste in state organs. Stalin taught us that we must not only be good at accumulating funds, but also "be good at using the accumulated reserves rationally and economically, so that not a penny of the people's property is wasted in vain, and that the accumulation can be used to meet the fundamental aspect of the extremely important needs of our country's industrialization." This instruction is of great significance to our country's current industrialization construction. Practicing economy is an important policy of financial work at all times, and we must strive to ensure that every penny of the country is used appropriately. It must be pointed out that any act of extravagance and waste and undermining state financial discipline is not allowed by the Party and the people.

    However, streamlining institutions and saving state administrative expenses is not easy, and requires in-depth education and organizational work. In the process of work, we will also encounter a series of complex issues, such as some people believing that the quality of cadres is low and fewer people will not work; the streamlined personnel cannot but be supported, and it is the same whether they are reduced or not; the streamlined personnel must be appropriately arranged for their work and settled in their lives. Yes, streamlining personnel requires patient persuasion and education work and meticulous organizational work. A responsible attitude must also be taken towards the work and life of the streamlined personnel and appropriate arrangements must be made. However, as long as the Party committees and governments at all levels recognize that streamlining state organs is an important method for the source of funds for our country's socialist industrialization, and then strengthen the leadership of this work and carry it out in a planned and organized manner, then these difficulties can and will be gradually overcome.

    严格节减国家机关的经费
    王子英
    中央人民政府委员会最近通过的一九五四年国家预算报告中指出：“节减国家机关经费，精简国家行政机构，这是国家积累工业化资金的一个重要方法。”这是党和政府为实现社会主义工业化的长期重要政策之一，是胜利完成一九五四年国家预算的一项重要保证。
    党和人民政府历来对节减国家机关经费、精简国家行政机构是极为重视的。远在一九四二年，抗日战争正处于困难时期，毛主席即曾对各解放区提出实行精兵简政这个“极其重要的政策”。毛主席并具体指出：“在这次精兵简政中，必须达到精简、统一、效能、节约和反对官僚主义五项目的。这五项，对于我们的经济工作和财政工作，关系极大，精简之后，减少了消费性的支出，增加了生产的收入，不但直接给予财政以好影响，而且可以减少人民的负担，影响人民的经济。”各解放区坚决地贯彻了这一政策，渡过了当时的困难，最后战胜了敌人。全国大陆解放后，在一九五○年，中央人民政府政务院颁布了“关于统一国家财政经济工作的决定”，成立了全国编制委员会，制订了各级军政机关人员、马匹、车辆等编制，切实整顿了当时国家机关人员编制中的混乱现象。同年六月，毛主席在中共中央七届三中全会上的报告中又指出：“国家机构所需经费的大量节减”是争取整个财政经济情况根本好转的三个条件之一。经过了全党和全体人民的一致努力，配合以财经工作各方面的正确措施，不到三年即取得了国家财政经济状况的根本好转。中央人民政府成立四年多来，对精简国家机构的工作，也在不断地进行着。过去适应战争时期的小县、小区制，逐渐合并为大县、大区，改建了乡一级政权，撤销、归并了某些市镇。今年又决定统一撤销大区建制，归并了若干省市。逐渐厘订了国家行政和文化教育机构的编制员额和定额比例。国家行政经费所占国家预算总支出的比重已由一九五○年的百分之十九点三降低到一九五四年的百分之九点五。所有这些措施，不仅有效地为国家节减了大量的行政经费，提高了机关工作效率，而且也为国家实现社会主义扩大再生产，积累工业化资金，减少非生产人员，充实国家经济建设机构创造了条件。
    但是，目前仍有不少部门和地方，对节减国家机关经费，精简国家行政机构的工作，并没有引起足够的重视；各级管理编制机构和财政部门亦未对上述工作进行有系统的检查和提出建设性的意见，工作中还存在着若干的缺点。正如邓小平副总理在关于一九五四年国家预算草案的报告中所指出的：
  “过去在经济建设事业费、文化教育事业费方面，定员定额仍有不合理现象”，“在国家机关中，目前仍然是机构大、层次多、冗员多，有些部门或单位的经费开支还有铺张浪费现象”。例如中央人民政府各部门有些直属局并无垂直领导的所属机构，仅仅是部的一个组成部分，但却按独立组织机构进行编制，人员很多，其中业务人员和服务人员的编制比例很不恰当，有些局的服务人员竟占机关总人数的百分之三十。中央人民政府有些部的组织环节过多，其中有些环节是不必要的，是可以缩减的。不按国家规定编制，随意超过编制和增加人员的现象，还十分严重。例如中央燃料工业部山东煤矿管理局今年预算报五百四十人，超过去年年初编制一百三十人。中央对外贸易部山东贸易局由去年年末的九十人，增至一百三十五人，超过应有编制四十五人，各部门和各地区对定员和定职的控制，也是十分不够的，如天津保育院工作人员和儿童的比例是一比一点二五，几乎是一个大人管一个儿童。该市政治学校教职员工与学生的规定比例是一比十，实际执行是一比五，超过一倍。热河马拉农具场原规定每人平均耕作八垧，而实际每人平均只耕地二垧，中央规定高等学校教职员工与学生比例是一比三点五，而中南音乐专科学校则为一比一点五九，华南农学院为一比一点九。另外，因为不考虑实际条件而盲目增设机构造成浪费的现象也普遍存在。如西康省电影放映队去年由十个队扩增至二十三个队，因放映机不够用，有六个队不能工作。不少机关单位在购置和修建方面也都有不同程度的铺张浪费现象。
    目前国家机关在使用国家经费中所存在的这些缺点，已在一定程度上影响了国家工业化资金的集中使用，增加了国家负担，浪费了人力，并助长了官僚主义。这种不合理情况，亟待切实加以整顿和改进。怎样来进行节减国家机关经费和精简国家行政机构的工作呢？
    首先要切实地精简机构，适当地减少编制人员，以提高工作效率，紧缩机关经费开支。目前国家机关中若干重叠和可有可无的机构必须加以适当的裁减或合并。某些机关，人浮于事，因人设事，工作人员一天只作半天的工作，或整天无事可作的情况是不能再允许存在的。为使人尽其用，各得其所，必须把这些多余的人员，调配到需要干部的部门去。斯大林曾经指出：“必须自下而上地精简和整顿我们国家的与合作社的机关、我们各人民委员部的与实行经济核算制的机关。我们管理机关底庞大的编制和无比的挥霍，已成为一般谈话的资料。难怪列宁曾几十次几百次重复说：工人和农民忍受不了我们国家机关底臃肿机构和浩繁开支，无论如何需要用一切办法、一切手段来加以精简。”这就是说，对于精简机构的工作必须采取一切有效办法认真贯彻执行。某些机关单位对于应该而且可以精简的机构和人员不愿坚决精简的保守主义和本位主义思想应该注意克服。实际上减少不必要的机构和人员并不会削弱机关的工作效能，相反地如果我们能够改善机关领导，减少内部层次，充分地发挥群众的积极性，是会增进机关工作效率的。那种害怕减少人员影响工作的顾虑是不必要的。
    其次，严格控制编制，实行定员定额。根据全国各地区、各级机构、各个单位的不同性质，从下而上地订定既切合实际又符合节约原则的编制定额和必要的实物使用标准与财务开支标准，是目前不可忽视的一项工作。这样还不够，还要进一步实行定职，而且对各事业机构的编制也要有一个规定。对于过去的超编人员，必须严格划分出来，逐步加以适当解决。过去某些不合定额的开支，要逐步加以纠正。任何机关或个人都必须坚持执行不经中央编制委员会批准，不得增加人员编制的规定。使国家编制真正成为举国一致共同遵守的法令规定。
    第三，对国家机关的一切铺张浪费现象必须进行不懈的斗争。斯大林教导我们，不仅要善于积累资金，而且“还要善于合理地、节省地使用积累起来的后备，使人民财产一个钱也不白白浪费，使积累能用于满足我国工业化的极重要的需要这一基本方面”。这一指示，对于我国目前进行工业化建设同样是有重要意义的。厉行节约，任何时候，都是财政工作的一项重要政策，我们必须努力做到使国家每一文钱都用之得当。必须指出任何铺张浪费和破坏国家财政纪律的行为，都是党和人民所不能允许的。
    但精简机构和节约国家行政经费，并不是容易的事情，需要进行深入的教育工作和组织工作，在工作过程中，也还会遇到一系列的复杂问题，诸如有些人认为干部质量低，人少不行；精简的人员，又不能不养着，减与不减反正一样；精简的人员，又须适当安插他的工作和安置他的生活。是的，精简人员，是要进行耐心的说服教育工作和细致的组织工作的。对精简人员的工作和生活也必须采取负责的态度给予适当的安排的。但只要各级党委和政府认识到精简国家机构，是我们国家社会主义工业化的资金来源的重要方法，进而加强对这个工作的领导，有计划有组织地进行。那末这些困难，是可以而且能够逐步克服的。
