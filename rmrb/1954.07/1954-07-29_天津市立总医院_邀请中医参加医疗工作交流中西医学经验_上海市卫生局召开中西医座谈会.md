    Tianjin Municipal General Hospital
    Invites Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners to Participate in Medical Work Exchange of Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine Experiences
    Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau Holds Symposium on Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine
    This June, Tianjin Municipal General Hospital established an acupuncture and moxibustion therapy room, inviting traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) practitioners to participate in medical work and exchange experiences in TCM and Western medicine. By mid-July, TCM practitioners in the acupuncture and moxibustion therapy room had already provided acupuncture and moxibustion treatment to 124 patients, with most patients experiencing good results. For example, a ten-year-old child named Li Guofan suffered from enuresis, wetting the bed almost every night. He had been treated in the hospital many times in the past without improvement. Recently, he was cured after eleven acupuncture treatments. Another patient suffered from facial paralysis, unable to move any facial muscles. He had to be fed milk through a nasal tube by doctors, which was very painful. After the TCM practitioner in the acupuncture and moxibustion therapy room performed the first acupuncture treatment on him, the patient could move the corners of his mouth. After the second acupuncture treatment, the upper half of his face could also move. He is currently continuing treatment.
    After TCM practitioners participated in the hospital's work, they had more opportunities to exchange medical experiences with Western medicine doctors, gaining preliminary understanding of the relationship between nerve distribution and "acupoints," and the relationship between acupuncture and moxibustion therapy and Pavlov's theory.
    In order to systematically study acupuncture and moxibustion therapy, Tianjin Municipal General Hospital not only designated Western medicine doctors to assist the acupuncture and moxibustion therapy room in its work, but also sent personnel from the physiotherapy department to inquire about the changes in the patients' conditions every day, make detailed records, and accumulate data for joint research by TCM and Western medicine doctors. After seeing the effectiveness of acupuncture and moxibustion therapy, many Western medicine doctors gradually corrected some of their incorrect views on TCM, and the connection between TCM and Western medicine is becoming increasingly close.
    On July 18, the Shanghai Municipal People's Government Health Bureau held a symposium on TCM and Western medicine, discussing issues related to the Shanghai Municipal TCM Hospital, which is scheduled to open at the end of August, and soliciting opinions on convening a city-wide TCM representative meeting. Participants included representatives from medical and health organizations such as the Shanghai Municipal Association of Traditional Chinese Medicine and the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Medical Association, as well as负责人 of the East China Administrative Committee Health Bureau, the Shanghai Municipal People's Government Culture and Education Committee, and the Shanghai First and Second Medical Colleges, as well as TCM representatives from various districts and experts in internal medicine and pediatrics, totaling over one hundred people.
    Wang Yuxian, Director of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government Health Bureau, pointed out in his speech that the establishment of the Shanghai Municipal TCM Hospital is an important measure to implement the Third National Health Administration Conference. It will further leverage the strength of TCM and help in the sorting out and development of TCM medicine. The establishment of the TCM Hospital is a major event for the medical community in Shanghai, especially for the TCM community. It is hoped that TCM doctors with rich knowledge and experience will actively participate in the work of the TCM Hospital, and that medical and health organizations, medical colleges, and hospitals will actively support this work. He also pointed out that TCM is a great national cultural heritage of China, with rich content and experience. Through outpatient and clinical research, TCM will be further developed and improved.
    In their speeches, the attending representatives unanimously expressed their support for the upcoming opening of the Shanghai Municipal TCM Hospital and the city-wide TCM representative meeting.
    Before the meeting concluded, Yan Yi, Deputy Director of the East China Administrative Committee Health Bureau, spoke at the meeting. He requested that TCM doctors should learn scientific medicine, and Western medicine doctors should also learn and study the rich medical heritage of the motherland, learning from each other's strengths and overcoming each other's weaknesses, and working together to protect the health of the people.

    天津市立总医院
    邀请中医参加医疗工作交流中西医学经验
    上海市卫生局召开中西医座谈会
    天津市市立总医院今年六月建立了针灸疗法室，邀请中医参加医疗工作，交流中西医学经验。到七月中旬止，针灸疗法室的中医已经为一百二十四个病人做了针灸疗法，大部分病人收到了良好的效果。如一个叫藜国藩的十岁的孩子患遗尿病，几乎每天晚上都尿床。过去在医院里治过多次没有见好，最近做了十一次针灸疗法就痊愈了。又如一个患者因为神经麻痹，面部任何肌肉都不能动，吃饭时只好由医生做鼻饲法，往鼻子里灌牛奶，非常痛苦。针灸疗法室的中医对他施行第一次针灸疗法以后，病人嘴角就能动了，第二次针灸后，脸的上半部也会动了，现在正继续治疗中。
    中医参加医院的工作后，有更多的机会和西医交流医学经验，对神经分布和“穴位”的关系、针灸疗法和巴甫洛夫学说的关系都有了初步的认识。
    天津市市立总医院为了系统地研究针灸疗法，不但指定西医协助针灸疗法室工作，而且派了理疗科的人员每天向每个做针灸疗法的病人探询病情的变化，做详细纪录，积累资料以供中西医共同研究。不少西医看到了针灸疗法的效果后，逐渐端正了对中医的某些不正确看法，中西医之间的联系正日益密切起来。
    上海市人民政府卫生局于七月十八日召开中西医座谈会，讨论了有关八月底即将开幕的上海市中医医院的问题，征求了关于召开全市中医代表会议的意见。参加会议的，有上海市中医学会、中华医学会上海分会等医务卫生团体和华东行政委员会卫生局、上海市人民政府文化教育委员会、上海第一和第二医学院的负责人，各区中医代表和内科、小儿科专家等一百余人。
    上海市人民政府卫生局局长王聿先在会上讲话指出：上海市中医医院的成立，是贯彻第三届全国卫生行政会议的一项重要措施，它将进一步发挥中医力量，有助于整理和发扬中医医学。中医医院的成立是上海市医务界、特别是中医界的一件大事，希望有丰富学识和经验的中医师能积极地参加中医医院的工作，希望各医务卫生团体、医学院、医院能积极支持这项工作。他还指出，中医学是中国伟大的民族文化遗产，它有丰富的内容和经验；通过门诊、临床的研究，将使中医学获得进一步发扬和提高。
    到会代表在发言中，对即将开幕的上海市中医医院和全市中医代表会议一致表示支持。
    会议结束前，华东行政委员会卫生局副局长阎毅在会上讲话。他要求中医要学习科学医学，西医也要学习和研究祖国丰富的医学遗产，互学、互用所长，互去所短，共同为保障人民的健康而努力。
