    Greet the Draft Constitution with New Production Achievements
    June Plan Exceeded
    The New Fifth Team of the Wangfeng Mine under the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau in Henan is an advanced production team. From October of last year to now, they have safely overfulfilled the state production plan every month. At the beginning of June this year, the team's workers launched a labor competition focusing on technological innovation to welcome "July 1st." Just as the competition was in full swing, news of the promulgation of the draft constitution arrived, and the workers' enthusiasm for production increased even more. On June 16th, the three shifts of workers held a production experience exchange meeting, exchanged work experiences, and specifically studied the issue of reducing explosive consumption. Group leader Zhou Wanyuan suggested using the "coal picking stick" (a tool for picking coal seams) to create a single hole method. With this change, explosive consumption rapidly decreased. Previously, one shift had to use 110 explosives, but now they only use 60. By June 22nd, the team had comprehensively overfulfilled the June production plan by 1.25%. In order to further improve production efficiency, they are actively experimenting with double-cycle operations.
    Production Efficiency Greatly Improved
    Ma Shengnian, an old technical worker in the Second Workshop of the Dalian Electrical Machinery Factory, has recently been working on drilling the coil support eyelets with a coal drill. The work plan requires him to produce 40 to 45 units per day. In the past, he used a "riveting iron" to punch, which was very laborious, and he could only produce 18 units per day, with more than 30% of them failing to meet quality standards. He and Tian Wenke, an old technical worker in the group, had studied the problem several times without a solution, and the work accumulated in the group increased. The day after the draft constitution was promulgated, their group organized a reading of the newspaper. Old Ma was very happy after listening to the content of the draft constitution. In order to celebrate this great event with practical actions, he decided to solve the key problem of punching the coil support eyelets. By the morning of June 18th, he had developed a new method of using a countersink instead of a "riveting iron" to punch the eyelets, and he applied it on the same day. As a result, the output increased fivefold compared to the past, and the quality was all qualified. On June 19th, he continued to use this countersink and punched out 25 units in just over an hour.
    Tool Improvement Successful
    Zhao Jun is a young worker in the machinist group of the metalworking workshop of the Linfen Enterprise Company Machinery Repair Factory in Shanxi Province. When their group accepted the task of processing 200 coal car wheels at the end of May, Zhao Jun and group leader Ren Peirong discussed improving the tools so that they could turn the wheel eye and mill the plane surface at the same time. After research and approval by the factory's technical guidance team, they conducted the first experiment in early June, which failed. Zhao Jun thought: Zhang Mingshan worked hard for three years to successfully create an anti-encirclement disk. I am a member of the Communist Youth League, can I still bow my head to difficulties? He thought day and night, studying the reasons for the failure. At this time, the good news of the promulgation of the draft constitution further encouraged his enthusiasm for creation. He was determined to make the tool experiment a success. He and Ren Peirong continued to experiment, and finally succeeded on June 25th. It originally took two hours and thirty minutes to make a coal car wheel. After the tool experiment was successful, it only takes thirty minutes to make one, increasing efficiency by a full four times, and the quality is completely qualified. This batch of tasks was originally planned to be completed in 200 days, but according to the current situation, it can be completed in 40 days. They are still continuing to study and improve the tools for turning coal car axles, striving to save more man-hours.
    Make the 60-inch Winding Machine Well
    Article 16 of the draft constitution stipulates: "The state encourages citizens' initiative and creativity in labor." Wang Fengen, a labor model of Shenyang City and a technician in the insulation workshop of the Shenyang Transformer Factory, felt particularly close to this article. At the beginning of last year, the factory began to produce 5,000 kVA large transformers. At that time, the bakelite cylinders used on the transformers were difficult to buy, and the factory did not have the equipment to make bakelite cylinders. He began to study making a winding machine to make bakelite cylinders. When he was making the winding machine, the leadership supported him. As soon as the workshop director heard that he had encountered difficulties in technology, he immediately took the time to help him study. When he encountered difficulties in his work, the party branch secretary promptly encouraged him, explaining that creative inventions are all obtained from constantly overcoming difficulties. After listening to the party branch secretary's words, he became more confident in his work, and finally made the winding machine successfully in June last year, solving the problem of insufficient bakelite cylinders that affected production at that time. Now Wang Fengen and his comrades are studying a 60-inch winding machine to further automate the cutting and paper cutting processes. He has initially drawn the drawings for the cutting part and submitted them to everyone for research. Comrades have made many valuable suggestions. He has revised the drawings based on everyone's suggestions, and they are now being reviewed and corrected by the technology section comrades. He is determined not to be arrogant or impetuous, to humbly learn from his comrades, and to make the 60-inch winding machine well as soon as possible, so that the three processes of winding, cutting, and paper cutting can all be automated, creating more wealth for the country.
    Complete the Task Ahead of Schedule
    After studying the draft constitution, all the employees of the 227-87 and 88 construction sites in the First Engineering Area of the LÃ¼da Second Construction Engineering Company have greatly increased their enthusiasm for labor. In the plastering project, the workers reallocated the labor force. In the past, two people plastered one room, and it took four days to complete, which affected the work of carpenters and painters. Now, four people plaster one room, and it only takes two days to complete, avoiding the phenomenon of carpenters and painters waiting for work in the past. In the operation, they established professional groups for plastering walls, plastering ceilings, and plastering baseboards, and at the same time, they generally used advanced tools such as large trowels and plastering applicators, which increased work efficiency by more than one time on average. In the roofing project, the workers also applied the advanced working method of shuttle roofing. On June 17th, Chu Yuekao proposed to change the past method of carrying soil with mud buckets in the soil transportation work, and instead use soil baskets to carry it up. Three people can supply one roofer's work (which required twelve workers in the past), which increased work efficiency by three times. In the bricklaying project, the workers not only promoted the parallel segmented flow operation method, but also used advanced tools such as ash scrapers and grouting buckets, so that bricklayers generally increased from 1,440 bricks per person per day to 1,600 bricks when building a brick wall, greatly accelerating the progress of the project. In the chimney plastering project, the plan required seven workers to complete, but they only used four workers to complete it. With the soaring enthusiasm of the workers, the achievements of various types of work are also generally improving. The workers proposed to use the early completion of the project task as a gift to the draft constitution.
      Promoted the Technological Innovation Movement
    The promulgation of the draft constitution has further advanced the technological innovation movement in the Jiang'an Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory in Wuhan City. On the third night after the promulgation of the draft constitution, Hu Guoding, Zhang Dexin and other 20 outstanding members of the Communist Youth League and young workers, who have been praised for their pioneering spirit, made a suggestion to more than 400 young workers in the factory: to express their support for the draft constitution with greater labor achievements, and to strive to improve product quality and save national resources through technological innovation. These 20 young workers simultaneously set out three guarantees for improving product quality, saving materials, and saving man-hours, as well as an inspection system for realizing these guarantees. This suggestion spread throughout the factory like a gust of wind. Young workers were studying blueprints for improving tools in groups of three or two. The assembly of bogies is a relatively weak link in the production of passenger car workshops. Chen Desheng, a member of the Communist Youth League, excitedly studied the method of improving bogie assembly in the dormitory until late at night on the 17th. Three young workers on the night shift in the locomotive workshop collectively studied the method of improving the installation of couplers after getting off work at 2:00 a.m. Fan Zhongzhi, a model worker of Wuhan City and a lathe work section chief, used his spare time to study and improve the die mold tool for expanding the steam chamber jacket.
