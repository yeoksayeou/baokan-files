    Greet the Draft Constitution with New Production Achievements
    June Plan Exceeded
    The New Fifth Team of the Wangfeng Mine under the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau in Henan is an advanced production team. From October of last year to now, they have safely overfulfilled the state production plan every month. At the beginning of June this year, the team's workers launched a labor competition focusing on technological innovation to welcome "July 1st." Just as the competition was in full swing, news of the promulgation of the draft constitution arrived, and the workers' enthusiasm for production increased even more. On June 16th, the three shifts of workers held a production experience exchange meeting, exchanged work experiences, and specifically studied the issue of reducing explosive consumption. Group leader Zhou Wanyuan suggested using the "coal picking stick" (a tool for picking coal seams) to create a single hole method. With this change, explosive consumption rapidly decreased. Previously, one shift had to use 110 explosives, but now they only use 60. By June 22nd, the team had comprehensively overfulfilled the June production plan by 1.25%. In order to further improve production efficiency, they are actively experimenting with double-cycle operations.
    Production Efficiency Greatly Improved
    Ma Shengnian, an old technical worker in the Second Workshop of the Dalian Electrical Machinery Factory, has recently been working on drilling the coil support eyelets with a coal drill. The work plan requires him to produce 40 to 45 units per day. In the past, he used a "riveting iron" to punch, which was very laborious, and he could only produce 18 units per day, with more than 30% of them failing to meet quality standards. He and Tian Wenke, an old technical worker in the group, had studied the problem several times without a solution, and the work accumulated in the group increased. The day after the draft constitution was promulgated, their group organized a reading of the newspaper. Old Ma was very happy after listening to the content of the draft constitution. In order to celebrate this great event with practical actions, he decided to solve the key problem of punching the coil support eyelets. By the morning of June 18th, he had developed a new method of using a countersink instead of a "riveting iron" to punch the eyelets, and he applied it on the same day. As a result, the output increased fivefold compared to the past, and the quality was all qualified. On June 19th, he continued to use this countersink and punched out 25 units in just over an hour.
    Tool Improvement Successful
    Zhao Jun is a young worker in the machinist group of the metalworking workshop of the Linfen Enterprise Company Machinery Repair Factory in Shanxi Province. When their group accepted the task of processing 200 coal car wheels at the end of May, Zhao Jun and group leader Ren Peirong discussed improving the tools so that they could turn the wheel eye and mill the plane surface at the same time. After research and approval by the factory's technical guidance team, they conducted the first experiment in early June, which failed. Zhao Jun thought: Zhang Mingshan worked hard for three years to successfully create an anti-encirclement disk. I am a member of the Communist Youth League, can I still bow my head to difficulties? He thought day and night, studying the reasons for the failure. At this time, the good news of the promulgation of the draft constitution further encouraged his enthusiasm for creation. He was determined to make the tool experiment a success. He and Ren Peirong continued to experiment, and finally succeeded on June 25th. It originally took two hours and thirty minutes to make a coal car wheel. After the tool experiment was successful, it only takes thirty minutes to make one, increasing efficiency by a full four times, and the quality is completely qualified. This batch of tasks was originally planned to be completed in 200 days, but according to the current situation, it can be completed in 40 days. They are still continuing to study and improve the tools for turning coal car axles, striving to save more man-hours.
    Make the 60-inch Winding Machine Well
    Article 16 of the draft constitution stipulates: "The state encourages citizens' initiative and creativity in labor." Wang Fengen, a labor model of Shenyang City and a technician in the insulation workshop of the Shenyang Transformer Factory, felt particularly close to this article. At the beginning of last year, the factory began to produce 5,000 kVA large transformers. At that time, the bakelite cylinders used on the transformers were difficult to buy, and the factory did not have the equipment to make bakelite cylinders. He began to study making a winding machine to make bakelite cylinders. When he was making the winding machine, the leadership supported him. As soon as the workshop director heard that he had encountered difficulties in technology, he immediately took the time to help him study. When he encountered difficulties in his work, the party branch secretary promptly encouraged him, explaining that creative inventions are all obtained from constantly overcoming difficulties. After listening to the party branch secretary's words, he became more confident in his work, and finally made the winding machine successfully in June last year, solving the problem of insufficient bakelite cylinders that affected production at that time. Now Wang Fengen and his comrades are studying a 60-inch winding machine to further automate the cutting and paper cutting processes. He has initially drawn the drawings for the cutting part and submitted them to everyone for research. Comrades have made many valuable suggestions. He has revised the drawings based on everyone's suggestions, and they are now being reviewed and corrected by the technology section comrades. He is determined not to be arrogant or impetuous, to humbly learn from his comrades, and to make the 60-inch winding machine well as soon as possible, so that the three processes of winding, cutting, and paper cutting can all be automated, creating more wealth for the country.
    Complete the Task Ahead of Schedule
    After studying the draft constitution, all the employees of the 227-87 and 88 construction sites in the First Engineering Area of the Lüda Second Construction Engineering Company have greatly increased their enthusiasm for labor. In the plastering project, the workers reallocated the labor force. In the past, two people plastered one room, and it took four days to complete, which affected the work of carpenters and painters. Now, four people plaster one room, and it only takes two days to complete, avoiding the phenomenon of carpenters and painters waiting for work in the past. In the operation, they established professional groups for plastering walls, plastering ceilings, and plastering baseboards, and at the same time, they generally used advanced tools such as large trowels and plastering applicators, which increased work efficiency by more than one time on average. In the roofing project, the workers also applied the advanced working method of shuttle roofing. On June 17th, Chu Yuekao proposed to change the past method of carrying soil with mud buckets in the soil transportation work, and instead use soil baskets to carry it up. Three people can supply one roofer's work (which required twelve workers in the past), which increased work efficiency by three times. In the bricklaying project, the workers not only promoted the parallel segmented flow operation method, but also used advanced tools such as ash scrapers and grouting buckets, so that bricklayers generally increased from 1,440 bricks per person per day to 1,600 bricks when building a brick wall, greatly accelerating the progress of the project. In the chimney plastering project, the plan required seven workers to complete, but they only used four workers to complete it. With the soaring enthusiasm of the workers, the achievements of various types of work are also generally improving. The workers proposed to use the early completion of the project task as a gift to the draft constitution.
      Promoted the Technological Innovation Movement
    The promulgation of the draft constitution has further advanced the technological innovation movement in the Jiang'an Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory in Wuhan City. On the third night after the promulgation of the draft constitution, Hu Guoding, Zhang Dexin and other 20 outstanding members of the Communist Youth League and young workers, who have been praised for their pioneering spirit, made a suggestion to more than 400 young workers in the factory: to express their support for the draft constitution with greater labor achievements, and to strive to improve product quality and save national resources through technological innovation. These 20 young workers simultaneously set out three guarantees for improving product quality, saving materials, and saving man-hours, as well as an inspection system for realizing these guarantees. This suggestion spread throughout the factory like a gust of wind. Young workers were studying blueprints for improving tools in groups of three or two. The assembly of bogies is a relatively weak link in the production of passenger car workshops. Chen Desheng, a member of the Communist Youth League, excitedly studied the method of improving bogie assembly in the dormitory until late at night on the 17th. Three young workers on the night shift in the locomotive workshop collectively studied the method of improving the installation of couplers after getting off work at 2:00 a.m. Fan Zhongzhi, a model worker of Wuhan City and a lathe work section chief, used his spare time to study and improve the die mold tool for expanding the steam chamber jacket.

    用新的生产成就欢迎宪法草案
    六月份计划超额完成
    河南焦作矿务局王封矿新五队是一个先进生产队。他们从去年十月到现在，月月安全地超额完成国家生产计划。今年六月初，该队工人为迎接“七一”，开展了以技术革新为主要内容的劳动竞赛。正在竞赛热潮上，传来宪法草案公布的消息，工人们的生产劲头更大了。六月十六日，三班工人在一处开生产经验交流会，交换了工作经验，并专门研究了降低炸药消耗量的问题。小组长周万源建议使用“掏煤棍”（掏煤槽的工具）打独眼的方法。这样一改变，炸药消耗量迅速降低，以前一班得用一百一十个炸药，现在只用六十个炸药。到六月二十二日，该队全面并超额百分之一点二五完成了六月份生产计划。他们为了使生产效率再提高一步，又在积极试验双循环作业。
    生产效率大大提高
    大连电机厂第二车间老技术工人马盛年最近干的是煤钻钻库冲眼活。作业计划要求他一天干出四十台到四十五台。他过去用“铆行”来冲，费力很大，一天只能出十八台，还有百分之三十以上质量不合规格。他曾经和组里的老技术工人田文科研究几次也没得到解决，小组里积压下来的活越来越多了。宪法草案公布的第二天，他们小组组织了一次读报。老马听了宪法草案的内容后非常高兴。为了用实际行动来庆贺这件大喜事，他决心要把冲钻库眼活的关键问题解决。到六月十八日上午，他研究出用洗子代替“铆行”冲眼的新办法，并在当天加以应用，结果，产量较过去提高了五倍，质量也全部合格。六月十九日他继续用这个洗子来干，在一小时多的时间里就冲出了二十五台。
    工具改进成功
    赵骏是山西省临汾企业公司机械修造厂金工车间机工小组的青年工人。他们小组在五月底接受了加工二百部煤车车轮的任务时，赵骏就和组长任培荣等商量，要改进工具，使能同时车车轮眼和铣平面。经过该厂技术指导小组研究批准，他们在六月初进行了第一次试验，结果失败了。赵骏想：张明山创造反围盘苦心研究三年才成功。我是青年团员，还能向困难低头吗？他日夜思索，研究失败的原因。这时，宪法草案公布的喜讯，更加鼓舞了他的创造热情。他下定决心，要把工具试验成功。他和任培荣继续试验，终于在六月二十五日试验成功了。煤车轮子原计划两小时三十分钟做一个，工具试验成功后，三十分钟就做一个，提高效率整四倍，而且质量完全合格。这一批任务，原计划二百天完成，按现在的情况看来，四十天就可完成了。他们还在继续研究改进车煤车轴的工具，争取节约更多的工时。
    把六十吋卷筒机作好
    宪法草案第十六条规定：“国家鼓励公民在劳动中的积极性和创造性”。沈阳市劳动模范、沈阳变压器厂绝缘车间技术员王凤恩对这一条特别感到亲切。去年年初，工厂开始生产五千仟伏大型变压器，当时变压器上用的电木筒很难买，厂里又没有作电木筒的设备，他就开始研究作一个卷筒机来作电木筒。在作卷筒机的时候，领导方面支持他，车间主任一听说他在技术上碰到了困难，就马上抽出时间帮助他研究。当他在工作中碰到困难时，党支部书记就及时鼓励他，说明创造发明都是从不断克服困难当中获得的。他听了党支部书记讲的话，工作更有信心了，终于在去年六月把卷筒机作成功，解决了当时电木筒不够而影响生产的问题。现在王凤恩和同志们正在研究一个六十吋卷筒机，要进一步把切料、裁纸两个工序也都变成自动化。他初步把切料那一部分图纸画出来了，交给大家研究，同志们提了很多宝贵的意见，他根据大家的意见把图纸作了修改，现在正由工艺科的同志审查修正。他决心不骄不躁，虚心向同志们学习，早日把六十吋卷筒机作好，使卷筒、切料、裁纸三个工序全部走向自动化，为国家创造更多的财富。
    提前完成任务
    学习宪法草案以后，旅大第二建筑工程公司第
  一工区二二七——八七、八八工地全体职工都大大地提高了劳动热情。在抹灰工程中，工人们重新配备了劳动力。过去是两个人抹一间房子，四天才能完成，这样就影响了木工、油工进行工作；现在四个人抹一间，只用两天就完成了，避免了过去木工、油工待工现象。在操作中，他们在抹墙、抹天棚、抹跋脚线等工序上建立了专业小组，同时普遍使用了大泥抹子、抹灰器等先进工具，平均提高工作效率一倍多。在?瓦工程中，工人们也把传梭?瓦先进工作法运用起来。六月十七日，初月考在运土工作时提出改变过去用泥斗子扛土操作的方法，改用土筐子往上挑，三个人就能供上一个瓦工
  （过去需要十二个工人）工作，提高了工作效率三倍。在砌砖工程中，工人们不但推广了平行分段流水作业法，同时，还把托灰耙子、灌浆斗子等先进工具利用起来了，使砖工在砌一砖墙时，普遍由每人每天一千四百四十块提高到一千六百块，大大地加速了工程进度。在抹烟筒工程中，计划要求七个工完成，但他们只用了四个工就完成了。随着工人劳动热情的高涨，现在各工种的成绩也普遍在提高。工人们提出用提前完成工程任务作为向宪法草案的献礼。
      推进了技术革新运动
    宪法草案的公布，使武汉市江岸机车车辆修理工厂的技术革新运动向前推进了一步。在宪法草案公布的第三天夜晚，具有首创精神而受到表扬的胡国定、张德馨等二十个优秀青年团员和青年工人，向全厂四百多个青年工人提出了一项建议：要用更大的劳动成就来表示对宪法草案的拥护，用技术革新的办法努力提高产品质量，节约国家资财。这二十个青年工人同时订出了提高产品质量、节约材料、节约工时的三项保证和实现这些保证的检查制度。这个建议像风一样在全厂传开了。青年工人们三三两两地在一起研究着改进工具的草图。台车的组装工作是客车工场生产上比较薄弱的一环，青年团员陈德胜十七日晚上就兴奋地在宿舍里研究改进台车组装方法直到深夜。机车工场三个值夜班的青年工人在午夜二时下班后，集体研究改进车钩安装方法。武汉市甲等劳动模范、镟工工长范忠志利用业余时间研究改进汽室套涨圈胎模工具。
