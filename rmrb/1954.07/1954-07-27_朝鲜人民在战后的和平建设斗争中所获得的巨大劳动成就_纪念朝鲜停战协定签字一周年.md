    Korean People's Great Labor Achievements in Post-War Peaceful Construction Struggle
    --Commemorating the First Anniversary of the Signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement
    Zheng Yilong, Vice Premier and Minister of Heavy Industry, Democratic People's Republic of Korea
    Today, the Korean people are welcoming the first anniversary of the armistice on the creative construction front of restoring and rebuilding cities, villages, factories, and enterprises that were devastated by the barbaric atrocities of US imperialism during the three-year Fatherland Liberation War.
    With the support and solidarity of the people of the great Soviet Union, China, and the people's democratic countries, and peace-loving people all over the world, the Korean people, in their heroic struggle to defend the freedom and independence of their motherland, achieved the victory of the Korean armistice and immediately began peaceful construction, striving for the possibility of a peaceful resolution to the unification of the fatherland.
    The victorious Korean people, responding to the call of their beloved leader Marshal Kim Il-sung, "Everything for strengthening the democratic base, restoring and developing the post-war people's economy," have risen up as one to the road pointed out by the Workers' Party of Korea and the Republic's government: to strive for new victories in the cause of restoring and rebuilding the post-war national economy.
    The Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, convened after the armistice, put forward the basic direction for restoring and rebuilding the post-war national economy.
    At this meeting, the beloved leader Marshal Kim Il-sung pointed out: The great national task before us is to restore and develop our national economy, first to carry out comprehensive preparation and consolidation work necessary for the restoration and development of the national economy within six months to a year; secondly, to formulate a three-year plan for restoring and developing the national economy, with a view to restoring various sectors of the national economy to pre-war levels; and in the third stage, to formulate and implement a five-year plan for the comprehensive development of national industry, with a view to developing our country into a prosperous, democratic, and independent nation.
    Kim Il-sung instructed us: The focus of restoring the national economy should be on the industrial sector. The basic direction of restoring industry is to lay the foundation for our country's future industrialization, eliminate the deformed remnants of industry left by Japanese imperialism, and restore and build light industries to expand heavy industry and guarantee the needs of the people's lives as quickly as possible.
    The Workers' Party of Korea and the Republic's government, considering that the overall national economic sectors suffered significant losses as a result of the three-year Fatherland Liberation War, and that many changes have taken place in the economic relations between cities and villages; noted that guaranteeing the rapid restoration and development of the post-war national economy based on these new connections, that is, emphasizing the great significance of restoring and developing the rural economy while restoring and developing industry, so that the development of industry and agriculture can be balanced.
    In terms of the rural economy, the focus is on improving the lives of individual farmers in the shortest possible time, extensively carrying out land improvement, promoting advanced farming methods, reclaiming wasteland, irrigation and water conservancy projects, eliminating livestock-less households, gradually developing state-owned livestock farms, and expanding aquatic and forestry industries. It is expected that in the next one or two years, the rural economy will not only reach pre-war levels but will also greatly exceed it.
    This task is enormous and not easy. However, if this task cannot be effectively completed, it will be impossible to consolidate and improve the victory won by our people in the Fatherland Liberation War and the safety of the people's lives, and it will be impossible to build a solid foundation for the prosperity, development, unification, and independence of the motherland.
    Therefore, the effective implementation of this task will become a decisive key in the struggle to create a happy future for our people.
    Our people have the subjective and objective conditions to effectively accomplish this glorious task. The construction achievements and experiences of the past year have fully confirmed this.
    The people of the great Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the people of various people's democratic countries not only celebrated the victory won by the heroic Korean people in the three-year Fatherland Liberation War as if it were their own victory, but also gave huge economic and technical assistance to the peaceful construction cause of the Korean people who are rising up to restore and build the post-war national economy.
    Inspired by the friendship and assistance of fraternal countries, the Korean people, in the first stage of post-war restoration and construction, completed the comprehensive preparation and consolidation work required for the planned restoration and development of the post-war national economy, in accordance with the basic direction put forward by Kim Il-sung.
    All sectors, starting with factories, enterprises, and mines, carried out investigation and consolidation work, as well as the preparation work for restoring and rebuilding production equipment and building new factories and mines. In the short period of half a year after the armistice, many temporary residences were built in our cities and villages. Farmers who had been evacuated to the mountains due to the enemy's barbaric bombing returned to their hometowns and restored the damaged farmland.
    At the same time, the work of sorting out and preparing design materials was carried out for comprehensive restoration work, many of the most important large-scale factories needed for future restoration and construction were established, and work began on training a large number of technical personnel and skilled workers.
    On the other hand, the Party and the government took various measures to stabilize and improve the lives of workers, farmers, and the general public; expanded the circulation network of daily necessities and commodities, continuously lowered prices several times, and gradually improved and raised the people's living standards, which further encouraged their confidence in the restoration and construction cause.
    The heroic Korean working class bravely overcame all difficulties and obstacles, demonstrated an indomitable fighting will and creativity, and established glorious labor achievements.
    For example, at the Gangseon Steel Works in the heavy industry sector, the No. 2 electric furnace was quickly repaired and started production in September of last year. The mines also repaired the destroyed concentrating plants and started operating. Many shipyards repaired and restored many damaged ships and launched them. The building materials industry sector, which occupies a primary position in the restoration and construction work, has also restored all or part of its production equipment in the past year and has begun producing construction materials in large quantities.
    Within two weeks of the signing of the armistice agreement, the workers of the Seungri Cement Factory restored the destroyed "Seungri" rotary kiln, ensuring the production of cement. Subsequently, in Cheonnaeri, the cement factory was also repaired on the ruins, and the calcining furnace began production. The new construction project of the Daeseong and Gangnam Pottery Factory, which produces 100 million bricks and tiles annually, was completed in four months due to the selfless labor of all employees. Under the goal of ensuring the annual production of 300 million bricks and tiles, the new construction or restoration projects of various large and small pottery factories are progressing according to plan.
    In the chemical industry sector, the workers of the Hungnam Fertilizer Factory were actively carrying out comprehensive restoration preparation and consolidation work, and on September 26 of last year, they completely restored the electrode workshop and started production; at the Suncheon Chemical Factory, the ignition ceremony of the No. 2 calcium carbide furnace was also held.
    In the power sector, the Supung Power Plant restored and renovated two generators within a month, and other power plants also quickly restored and renovated the generators and their equipment that had been destroyed by the enemy's bestial bombing in a very short period of time.
    The workers of the railway sector ensured the operation of the Republic's main railway lines shortly after the signing of the armistice agreement. Not only that, they also overfulfilled their annual transportation plan and began the new railway construction project between Donghaeju and Yan'an.
    These achievements of the railway sector workers have provided a reliable guarantee for the transportation of materials and raw materials urgently needed by various sectors of the national economy at the current stage.
    The restoration and construction of the rural areas has also achieved brilliant successes.
    In the rural economic sector, our people filled and restored more than 10,000 jeongbo of bomb craters between January and May of this year, and continued to restore the farmers' residences destroyed by the enemy's bombing in various rural areas. For example, in Oehak-ri, Cheorwon-gun, Gangwon-do, where the entire village was reduced to ashes during the war, 517 farmers' residences have now been rebuilt, and the democratic propaganda room, junior high school, people's school, clinic, and other cultural and health facilities have all been restored, giving the entire village a new look.
    The reservoirs, led by the Gyeonryong and Jamo reservoirs, which were destroyed by the enemy's barbaric bombing during the war, were also repaired before the spring plowing.
    In this way, the entire working people of our country, led by the advanced working class, effectively completed the preparation and consolidation work needed for the overall restoration and development of the national economy destroyed by the enemy.
    These labor achievements have brought significant changes to the lives of our people, made great contributions to the planned restoration and development of the national economy, and also laid the foundation for formulating a three-year plan for the restoration and development of the people's economy.
    Immediately afterwards, the Korean people began to implement the three-year plan that guaranteed the beginning of the boundless prosperity and development of their motherland.
    The Three-Year Plan for the restoration and development of the people's economy after the war includes restoring and building factories and enterprises that were destroyed by the bestial atrocities of US imperialism during the three-year Fatherland Liberation War, laying the foundation for national industrialization, and rapidly improving the material and cultural living standards of the people that were lowered by the war.
    The decree on the three-year plan is a combat program for the entire Korean people to build the northern half of the Republic into a solid democratic base.
    All the people of our country deeply recognize the great political and economic significance of the three-year plan. The instructions given by Marshal Kim Il-sung at the Seventh Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea have further strengthened the fighting confidence of our people to guarantee the completion of the three-year plan with revolutionary practice.
    This noble confidence of the Korean people has been expressed in brilliant labor achievements.
    Our country's industrial gross production plan for the first half of 1954 was 100% completed. Among them, the second quarter plan was completed by 101%.
    The industrial gross production of many sectors in the first half of this year exceeded the plan: heavy industry by 105%, light industry by 104%, the power sector by 107%, forestry by 102%, the production industrial enterprises of the Ministry of Transportation by 101%, and the production industrial enterprises of the Ministry of Health by 102%.
    The output value of industrial products increased by 49% compared to the first half of 1953.
    The utilization rate of industrial equipment has also increased significantly.
    The power generation capacity utilization rate of power plants in the second quarter of 1954 increased by 21% compared to the second quarter of 1953.
    In the second quarter of 1954, the average actual excavation volume of mining rock drilling equipment per machine per month exceeded the planned quota by 13% to 25%. In metallurgical enterprises, the steelmaking time of electric furnaces was actually shortened by 19% compared to the plan. The utilization rate of spinning equipment in textile factories actually increased by 13% compared to the plan.
    The agricultural sector has already achieved significant labor achievements in the restoration of destroyed irrigation equipment and agricultural arable land. Farmers are widely adopting advanced farming methods to increase yields per unit area, increase the number of livestock, and work selflessly to supply more grain and meat to the restoration and construction projects, and to provide more raw materials for the growing industry.
    The spring plowing and sowing area in 1954 was completed by 107% of the plan, which is an increase of more than 18,000 jeongbo compared to the spring sowing area before the end of June 1953.
    As of the end of June 1954, there were 998 agricultural production cooperatives in low and high forms organized by farmers on a voluntary basis. There are 92 sideline production cooperatives for animal husbandry and sericulture.
    The Party and the government took a series of measures to ensure the rapid development of the destroyed rural economy and the completion of the spring sowing work in 1954.
    In order to solve the shortage of draft animals, farm tools, and food needed by some individual farmers, 1.328 billion won in agricultural loans was allocated in the first half of 1954. At the same time, the government exchanged 1,555 tons of rice seeds and many other fine seeds with farmers, and loaned out 11,211 tons of seeds, 11,486 tons of grain, and 24,506 tons of chemical fertilizers.
    Farmers were infinitely encouraged by such care from the Party and the government. In order to increase yields per unit area, early sowing was carried out, and the amount of fertilizer was greatly increased. This year's rice transplanting was completed 15 days earlier than before the war. Compared with last year, the amount of fertilizer applied in this year's spring sowing increased by 43% for self-supplied fertilizer and 52% for chemical fertilizer.
    The number of livestock has also increased significantly. Compared with the end of June 1953: horses increased threefold, oxen increased by 2%, pigs increased by 58%, and sheep increased by 6%.
    The spring afforestation project in 1954 became a widespread national movement.
    The afforestation area completed 111% of the planned area. The number of trees planted was 349 million, which is a significant increase compared to the number of trees planted in the spring of 1953.
    In terms of railway and automobile transportation, the railway freight volume in the first half of 1954 completed 101% of the plan, an increase of 150% compared to the first half of 1953. Railway passenger transport increased 16 times compared to the first half of 1953. The automobile transportation volume in the first half of 1954 completed 133% of the plan, an increase of 203% compared to the first half of 1953.
    In various sectors of the national economy and culture, large-scale national basic construction work was carried out to restore the destruction caused by the war. The amount of state basic construction investment in the first half of 1954 increased three to four times compared to the first half of 1953.
    In the first half of 1954, more than 90 important production enterprises started production, and production capacity increased significantly.
    The power sector restored the power generation equipment of three power plants. The coal mining sector actively carried out drilling and restoration drilling work. The important production equipment of six concentrating facilities in the mining sector and six electric furnaces in steel plants in the metallurgical sector, led by the No. 2 electric furnace of the Munpyeong Smelting Plant and the open-hearth furnace of the Hwanghae Iron Works, have all started operating and produced major products such as steel, iron wire, alloy steel, and crude aluminum.
    In the chemical and building materials sectors, the welding workshop, chemical fertilizer plant, glass factory, dry and wet workshops of three cement plants, 25 brick and tile factories, and many lumber mills have started production. The transportation sector has restored and built more than 35 iron bridges, including the Daedong River Iron Bridge, and more than 120 kilometers of railways and more than 3,600 meters of automobile and pedestrian bridges.
    In the rural economic sector, irrigation facilities were repaired and expanded, and more than five reservoirs were restored, increasing the irrigation area by thousands of jeongbo. At the same time, the Korean people have massively restored and built many educational, cultural, and health facilities such as schools, hospitals, and cinemas. More than 168,000 square meters of schools have been restored and built, with more than 82,000 seats in clubs, cinemas, and theaters. The total number of hospital beds in the Republic is now more than 2,800 more than in the first half of last year, and is constantly receiving medical assistance from the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and various people's democratic countries.
    Since the first half of 1954, the Korean people have launched a national movement to welcome the 9th anniversary of the "August 15" liberation with labor achievements. Workers, staff, students, and citizens have poured their fiery construction enthusiasm into the restoration and construction of the heroic city of Pyongyang.
    Considering it their most glorious task to restore and build the democratic capital of Pyongyang, a powerful source of strength for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, into a beautiful and modern city as soon as possible, the citizens of Pyongyang, displaying their boundless love for the democratic capital in patriotic selfless labor, gloriously completed the first phase of the Pyongyang City Restoration and Construction Plan on July 19 this year. The citizens of Pyongyang, who have risen up to carry out restoration and construction, have achieved miraculous great achievements in the recent 45 days. During this period, they completed the paving project of the station front avenue and Stalin Road, totaling more than 3,600 meters in length, the ring road totaling more than 3,000 meters in length, Kim Il-sung Square of more than 36,000 square meters, Mao Zedong Square of more than 23,000 square meters, and basically completed the West Pyongyang Stadium, and are rapidly carrying out the construction project of high-rise buildings led by workers' collective housing, gloriously building or repairing more than ten universities and high schools led by Kim Il-sung University, more than 80 people's schools and junior high schools, and the Moranbong Theater with more than 800 seats.
    The strong struggle made by the citizens of Pyongyang in the cause of building Pyongyang shows the patriotic enthusiasm and indomitable fighting will of the Korean people who have risen up to carry out the restoration and construction of the post-war national economy.
    Our brilliant achievements are not only manifested in the victorious completion of the plan, but also in the establishment of work order in various sectors of the national economy, the widespread adoption of advanced technology, and the accumulation of construction experience.
    In the process of production and construction, the working people of our country have spared no effort to give play to creativity, and many production innovators have emerged. They have increased production quotas and have successfully solved the main problem facing us - the shortage of labor. The entire working people of our country, led by the working class, have further tempered themselves in their patriotic labor struggle, and our staff have significantly improved their business and political leadership level.
    The brilliant achievements made by the Korean people after the war will promote the economic upsurge in our country and will become the basis for the rapid development of culture.
    This will further consolidate the political and ideological unity of our people based on the worker-peasant alliance and will bring them unwavering confidence in victory.
    All these achievements have proved how powerful the strength of our people is, who are united around the Party and the leader, wholeheartedly building a beautiful and prosperous motherland as soon as possible.
    These achievements have also given a very heavy blow to US imperialism and its Syngman Rhee puppets who disregard the unanimous desire of the Korean people for the peaceful unification of the motherland and disrupt the discussion of the Korean issue at the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference.
    So what are the reasons why the Korean people have been able to achieve such brilliant achievements in the past year?
    The three-year plan for restoring and developing the post-war national economy and all our country's peaceful construction work are completely based on the wishes of the Korean people. This shows that the Workers' Party of Korea and the beloved leader Marshal Kim Il-sung correctly organize and lead us to new victories based on the wishes of the people, which is a guarantee for the success of our country's construction work. At the same time, the reason why the huge strength of our people can be concentrated or is being concentrated on the powerful labor front lies in the endless vitality and superiority of our country's people's democratic social system. Along with all these subjective conditions, we also have sufficient objective conditions, that is, we have the great assistance in materials and technology given to us by the people of the great Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other fraternal countries. The huge assistance of friendly countries is indispensable in restoring and building factories, mines, and enterprises.
    Thanks to the assistance of fraternal countries, many basic construction projects and production enterprises in our country have been guaranteed to obtain new equipment and advanced machinery; in rural areas, they have obtained the supply of needed materials such as tractors, farm tools, draft horses, and fertilizers.
    The technical personnel from the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other fraternal countries who are now dispatched to our country have solved the most pressing technical problems at present for us and have made noble contributions to construction and production increase.
    In addition, our comrades-in-arms, the Chinese People's Volunteers, directly help our restoration and construction. The warriors of the Chinese People's Volunteers, who have shared weal and woe with the Korean people and fought bravely in the three years of cruel war against the common enemy and made great contributions to the struggle for victory, have established glorious labor achievements in the restoration and construction cause of all sectors of the Korean people.
    The merits established by the Chinese People's Volunteers in the war against the common enemy together with the Korean people and the labor achievements obtained in the construction cause to aid the Korean people will be forever remembered in the hearts of the Korean people and will be permanently praised for generations to come.
    Proletarian internationalist assistance is one of the powerful guarantees for the victory of our people not only in the struggle against the invaders but also in the struggle to restore and build the post-war national economy.
    Our people have never been afraid of difficulties, bravely overcome difficulties and obstacles, and have won victory in the struggle to overcome all difficulties. The new struggle history of the Korean people for peaceful construction will shine brightly with the brilliant labor achievements of the people.
    Our country's huge economic development will promote the realization of the Korean people's historical desire - the great cause of peaceful reunification of the motherland, and will contribute to Asian and world peace.

    朝鲜人民在战后的和平建设斗争中所获得的巨大劳动成就
    ——纪念朝鲜停战协定签字一周年
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内阁副首相兼重工业相  郑一龙
    今天，朝鲜人民在恢复和重建在三年的祖国解放战争中由于美帝国主义的野蛮暴行而惨遭破坏的城市、乡村、工厂、企业的创造性的建设战线上，迎接停战一周年。
    朝鲜人民在伟大的苏联、中国和各人民民主国家的人民和全世界爱好和平人民的支持和声援下，在保卫自己祖国的自由和独立英勇斗争中，获致了朝鲜停战的胜利以后，立即着手进行和平建设，并争取和平解决祖国统一问题的可能性。
    在战争中获得胜利的朝鲜人民，响应着敬爱的领袖金日成元帅的“一切为了加强民主基地，恢复和发展战后人民经济”的号召，向着朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府所指的道路：为了争取恢复重建战后国民经济事业中的新的胜利，如同一个人似地站起来了。
    停战后所召开的朝鲜劳动党中央委员会第六次全体会议，提出了恢复重建战后国民经济的基本方向。
    在这一会议上，敬爱的领袖金日成元帅指出：摆在我们面前的巨大的全国性任务，是为了恢复和发展我们的国民经济，首先在半年至一年内展开为恢复和发展国民经济所必要的全面的准备和整理工作；其次要制订恢复和发展国民经济的三年计划，以期使国民经济各部门恢复到战前水平；在第三阶段，要制订全面发展国家工业的五年计划并付诸实现，以期把我们的祖国发展成为富强的民主主义独立国家。
    金日成元帅教导我们说：恢复国民经济的重点应放在工业部门。恢复工业的基本方向是奠定我国将来工业化的基础，必须消灭日本帝国主义的统治所遗留下来的工业上的畸形性残余，必须尽速恢复建设为扩大重工业和保证人民生活需要的轻工业。
    朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府考虑到：由于三年来的祖国解放战争，全盘的国民经济各部门遭受的重大损失的结果，城市与乡村之间的经济关系上产生了不少变化；注意到了以它们之间的新的联系为基础来保证迅速复兴和发展战后国民经济，即为了工农业之发展能够平衡，在恢复发展工业时重视恢复发展农村经济的重大的意义。
    在农村经济方面，重点是在最短期内提高个体农民的生活，广泛展开土地改良、推广先进耕作法、开荒、灌溉水利等事业，消灭无畜农户，逐渐发展国营牧畜场，扩大水产及林产业等。预计在今后一、二年中，农村经济不仅要达到战前水平，而且要大大地超过它。
    这一任务是庞大而且不容易的。可是如不能有效地完成这一任务，就不可能巩固和提高我国人民在祖国解放战争中争取的胜利及人民生活的安全，也就不可能建成祖国的繁荣发展和统一、独立的巩固的基础。
    因此，有效地实现这一任务，将成为在创造我国人民幸福的未来的斗争中的决定性的关键。
    我国人民具有能够有效地完成这一光荣任务的主观及客观的条件。过去一年来的建设成就及其经验，充分地证实了这一点。
    伟大的苏联、中华人民共和国和各人民民主国家人民，不仅如同自己本身的胜利似地庆祝英雄的朝鲜人民在三年的祖国解放战争中所争取的胜利，而且对奋起进行恢复建设战后国民经济的朝鲜人民的和平建设事业，给了巨大的经济上及技术上的援助。
    朝鲜人民受到兄弟般各国人民的友谊和援助的鼓舞，在战后恢复建设的第一阶段，根据金日成元帅所提出的基本方向，完成了有计划地恢复发展战后国民经济上所需的全面的准备工作和整理工作。
    以工厂、企业、矿山为首的一切部门，都进行了调查整理工作及恢复重建生产设备和新建厂矿的准备工作。在停战后短短的半年内，在我国城市和乡村建设了许多临时住宅。由于敌人的野蛮轰炸而疏散到山沟里的农民，回到了自己的故乡，恢复了被破坏的耕地。
    同时，为全面的恢复工作进行了设计资材的整理准备工作，建立了许多为今后恢复建设事业所需的最重要的大规模的工厂，并着手培养大量的技术人员和技术工人。
    另一方面，党和政府采取了安定和提高工人、农民以及一般居民生活的各种措施；扩大了生活必需品及商品的流通网，连续几次降低物价，逐渐改善和提高了人民的生活水平，这就更加鼓舞了他们对于恢复建设事业的信心。
    英雄的朝鲜工人阶级勇敢地克服着一切困难和难关，发挥着不屈不挠的斗争意志和创造性，树立了光辉的劳动功勋。
    例如，在重工业部门的降仙制钢所，很快就抢修了第二号电炉，从去年九月就开始了生产。各矿厂也修复了被破坏的选矿厂并开始操作。许多造船所修理和恢复了许多被破坏的船只，并已下水。在恢复建设工作中占着首要地位的建筑材料工业部门，也在过去的一年当中，修复了全部或部分的生产设备，并已开始大量生产建设器材。
    缔结停战协定不到两星期的期间内，胜湖里水泥工厂的工人就恢复了被破坏的“胜利号”回转窑，保障了水泥的生产。接着在川内里，水泥工厂也在废墟上修复了，烧成炉开始生产了。每年生产一亿块砖瓦的大成、江南窑业工厂的新设工程，由于全体职工们的忘我劳动，四个月内就完成了。在保障每年生产三亿块砖瓦的目标之下，各地大小不同的窑业工厂的新设或恢复工程，都在按计划进展。
    在化学工业部门，兴南肥料工厂的工人们在踊跃地进行全盘性的恢复准备及整理工作的同时，已在去年九月二十六日完全恢复了电极车间并着手生产；在顺川化学工厂也举行了电石二号炉的点火式。
    在电力部门，水丰发电厂在一个月内恢复和整顿了两个发电机，在其他的发电厂也在很短的期间内迅速地恢复和整顿了被敌人的野兽般的轰炸破坏了的发电机及其设备。
    铁道部门的工人在缔结停战协定不久，就保障了共和国的主要铁路干线的运行。不仅如此，他们还超额完成自己的一年间的运输计划，并开始了东海州—延安间的铁路新设工程。
    铁道部门工人的这些成就，使现阶段的国民经济各部门急需的资材与原料的运输有了可靠的保证。
    农村的恢复建设事业也取得了光辉的成就。
    在农村经济部门的我国人民，在今年一月到五月间，填平并恢复了一万多町步的弹坑，在各地农村继续恢复着被敌人的轰炸而破坏了的农民住宅。例如，在战争期间全村化为灰烬的江原道铁原郡外鹤里，现在已重建了五百十七户农民住宅，并且全部恢复了民主宣传室、初级中学校、人民学校、诊疗所及其他文化、保健设备，全里面貌一新。
    在战争期间被敌人的野蛮轰炸而破坏了的以见龙、慈母贮水池为首的各贮水池，也在春耕前修复了。
    就这样，以先进的工人阶级为首的我国全体劳动人民，有效地完成了为全盘恢复和发展被敌人破坏了的国民经济所需要的准备与整理工作。
    这些劳动成就给我国人民生活带来显著改变，对国民经济按照计划恢复和发展作了巨大的贡献，同时也为制订人民经济恢复发展三年计划打下了基础。
    紧接着，朝鲜人民就着手实行保证自己祖国的无限的繁荣与发展的开始的三年计划。
    战后人民经济恢复发展的三年计划，包括恢复建设在三年的祖国解放战争过程中因美帝国主义的野兽般的暴行而被破坏了的工厂、企业，并为国家工业化打下基础，迅速提高因战争而降低的人民物质、文化生活水平。
    关于三年计划的法令，是为使共和国的北半部建成坚固的民主基地的全体朝鲜人民的战斗纲领。
    我国全体人民深深地认识到三年计划在政治上及经济上的重大意义。金日成元帅在朝鲜劳动党中央委员会第七次全体会议上提出的指示，更加坚定了我国人民以革命实践来保证完成三年计划的战斗信心。
    朝鲜人民的这种崇高的信心，在光辉的劳动成就中得到了表现。
    我国一九五四年上半年的工业总生产计划，百分之百地完成了。其中第二季度计划完成了百分之一百零一。
    许多部门的今年上半年的工业总生产额都超过了计划：重工业是百分之一百零五，轻工业是百分之一百零四，电力部门是百分之一百零七，林业是百分之一百零二、交通省生产工业企业是百分之一百零一，保健省生产工业企业是百分之一百零二。
    工业制品生产的生产额，比一九五三年上半年增长了百分之四十九。
    工业设备的利用率也有显著的提高。
    发电站在一九五四年第二季度的发电能力利用率比一九五三年第二季度提高了百分之二十一。
    在一九五四年第二季度，矿山凿岩机件每月每台平均实际采掘量超过计划定额的百分之十三至百分之二十五。在冶金企业中的电炉炼钢时间，实际成绩比计划缩短了百分之十九。纺织工厂的纺纱设备利用率，实际成绩比计划增加了百分之十三。
    农业部门在被破坏了的灌溉设备与农业耕地的恢复事业上，已经取得了显著的劳动成就。农民们广泛地采用先进的耕作法，提高单位面积的产量，增加了家畜的头数，以更多的粮食与肉类供应恢复建设工程，为给长成的工业提供更多的原料而忘我地努力着。
    一九五四年春耕播种面积完成了计划的百分之一百零七，这比一九五三年六月底前的春季播种面积增加了一万八千多町步。
    农民们在自愿的原则下组织的低级及高级形式的农业生产合作社，到一九五四年六月底为止，有九百九十八所。畜牧及养蚕等副业生产合作社有九十二所。
    党和政府为了保障被破坏了的农村经济的迅速发展与一九五四年春季播种工作的完成，采取了一系列的措施。
    为了解决一部分个体农民所需要的畜力、农具及食粮的不足，一九五四年上半年拨出了十三亿二千八百万元的农业贷款。同时，政府和农民交换了一千五百五十五吨稻种和其他许多优良种子，同时贷出了一万一千二百十一吨种子，一万一千四百八十六吨的粮食和二万四千五百零六吨化学肥料。
    农民们由于党和政府这样的关怀而感到无限的鼓舞。为了提高单位面积产量，进行了早期播种工作，并大量增加肥料。今年的插秧比战前提前完成十五天。今年春季播种中的施肥量和去年比较，自给肥料增加了百分之四十三，化学肥料增加了百分之五十二。
    家畜头数也有显著的增长，和一九五三年六月底比较：马增加三倍，牡牛增加百分之二，猪增加百分之五十八，羊增加百分之六。
   一九五四年的春季造林事业，成为了广泛的全民性的运动。
    植林面积完成了计划面积的百分之一百十一。造林棵数是三亿四千九百万棵，比一九五三年春季造林棵数有显著的增长。
    在铁道及汽车运输方面，一九五四年上半年的铁道货物运输量完成了计划的百分之一百零一，比一九五三年上半年增加了百分之一百五十。铁道旅客运输比一九五三年上半年增加了十六倍。一九五四年上半年的汽车运输量完成了计划的百分之一百三十三，比一九五三年上半年增加了百分之二百零三。
    在国民经济及文化各部门，为恢复因战争而遭到的破坏，进行了大规模的全民性的基本建设工作。一九五四年上半年的国家基本建设投资额，比一九五三年上半年增加三、四倍。
    一九五四年上半年，有九十所以上的重要生产企业开工生产，生产能力有了显著的增加。
    电力部门修复了三个发电厂的发电设备。煤矿部门积极地展开着钻井及修复钻井的工作。矿山部门的六处选矿设备，及冶金部门的以文坪冶炼厂的二号电炉及黄海制铁所的平炉为首的钢铁厂的六个电炉等重要生产设备，都已开工，生产了钢铁、铁线、合金钢、粗铝等主要产品。
    在化学和建筑材料部门，开工生产的有焊接车间、化学肥料厂、玻璃工厂、三所水泥厂的干式及湿式车间、二十五所砖瓦厂和许多制材工厂。运输部门恢复和建设了以大同江铁桥为首的三十五座以上的铁桥和一百二十公里以上的铁路及三千六百公尺以上的汽车及人渡桥。
    在农村经济部门，修复和扩大了灌溉设备，恢复了五所以上的贮水池，增加了数千町步的灌溉面积。与此同时，朝鲜人民大规模地恢复和建设了许多学校、医院、电影院等教育文化保健设备。恢复和建设了十六万八千平方公尺以上的学校，有座位八万二千以上的俱乐部、电影院和剧院。现在共和国所有病床的总数，比去年上半年增加了二千八百余张，并不断地从苏联、中华人民共和国及各人民民主国家得到医疗上的帮助。
    一九五四年上半年以来，朝鲜人民展开了以劳动成就来迎接“八·一五”解放九周年的全民性运动。工人、职员、学生、市民以热火朝天的建设热情倾注在英雄城市——平壤的恢复建设事业上。
    把朝鲜民主主义人民共和国有力的力量源泉——民主首都平壤早日恢复建设成美丽而现代化的城市，看做是自己最光荣任务的平壤市民，把对民主首都的无限热爱发挥在爱国的忘我劳动上，于今年七月十九日光荣地完成了平壤市恢复建设计划第一阶段的任务。奋起进行恢复建设的平壤市民，在最近的四十五天当中争取了奇迹性的巨大成就，在这一期间完成了累计三千六百余公尺长的站前大路和斯大林路、累计三千余公尺长的轮环线路、三万六千余平方公尺的金日成广场、二万三千余平方公尺的毛泽东广场等的铺装工程，和基本上完成了西平壤体育场，并快速度地进行着以工人集体住宅为首的高层建筑物的建筑工程，光荣地新建或修复着以金日成综合大学为首的十余所大学和高中、八十余所人民学校与初中，和有八百余个座位的牡丹峰剧场。
    平壤市民在建设平壤的事业中所作的如此强有力的斗争，显示了奋起进行恢复建设战后国民经济的朝鲜人民的爱国热情和不屈不挠的斗争意志。
    我们所取得的光辉成就，不仅表现在胜利地完成计划上，而且表现在国民经济各部门的确立工作秩序、广泛采用先进技术和积累建设经验等方面。
    在生产和建设过程中，我国劳动人民不遗余力地发挥创造性，产生了许许多多的生产革新者。他们提高了生产定额，并圆满地解决了曾摆在我们面前的主要问题——劳动力不足的问题。以工人阶级为首的我国全体劳动人民，在自己的爱国的劳动斗争中，更锻炼了自己，我们的工作人员显著地提高了自己的业务上、政治上的领导水平。
    战后朝鲜人民所取得的辉煌成就，将促进我国的经济高潮，并将成为迅速发展文化的基础。
    这将更加巩固以工农联盟为基础的我国人民的政治上、思想上的团结，并将给他们带来对胜利坚定不移的信心。
    这一切成就都证实了：一心一意早日建设美丽而富强的祖国、团结在党和领袖周围的我国人民的力量，是如何地强大。
    这些成就也给了在日内瓦外长会议上不顾朝鲜人民和平统一祖国的一致愿望、破坏朝鲜问题的讨论的美帝国主义及其李承晚走狗以极沉重的打击。
    那末朝鲜人民在过去一年当中能够获得如此光辉成就的原因何在呢？
    恢复发展战后国民经济的三年计划和我国的全部和平建设工作，完全是根据朝鲜人民的愿望而作成的。这就说明了：朝鲜劳动党和敬爱的领袖金日成元帅是根据人民的愿望来正确地组织和领导我们走向新的胜利，这是我国的建设工作成功的保证。同时，我国人民的巨大力量之所以能够集中或正在集中于强有力的劳动战线上，是在于我国的人民民主主义的社会制度的无穷无尽的生活力和优越性。与这一切的主观条件同时，我们还具有充分的客观条件，那就是我们有着以伟大的苏联、中华人民共和国和其他各兄弟国家人民给予我们以物资与技术上的巨大援助。友邦国家的巨大援助，在恢复建设工厂、矿山、企业上是必不可少的。
    由于兄弟般各国人民的援助，保证了我国许多基本建设工程和生产企业获得了新的设备和先进机器；在农村，获得了拖拉机、农具、耕马、肥料等所需物资的供应。
    现在派遣到我国的苏联、中华人民共和国和其他各兄弟国家的技术人员，给我们解决了目前最迫切需要的技术问题，在建设和增产上有着高贵的贡献。
    另外，我们的战友——中国人民志愿军，直接帮助着我们的恢复建设。在反对共同敌人的三年来的残酷战争中，曾与朝鲜人民同甘共苦、英勇战斗，给争取胜利的斗争作了巨大贡献的中国人民志愿军勇士，在朝鲜人民的各部门的恢复建设事业中，都建立着光辉的劳动成就。
    中国人民志愿军在与朝鲜人民一道反对共同敌人的战争中所建立的功勋和在为援助朝鲜人民的建设事业而获得的劳动成就，将永远牢记在朝鲜人民的胸怀里，并将永久地传颂于子孙万代。
    无产阶级国际主义的援助，不仅在反对侵略者的斗争中，而且在恢复建设战后国民经济的斗争中，都是保障我国人民的胜利的强有力的保证之一。
    我国人民一向不怕困难，勇敢地克服着困难与难关，并在克服一切困难的斗争中获得了胜利。为和平建设的朝鲜人民的新的斗争历史，将以人民的辉煌的劳动成就灿烂发光。
    我国的巨大的经济上的发展，将促进我国人民的历史性的愿望——和平统一祖国的伟大事业的实现，并对于亚洲及世界和平将有所贡献。
