Xinhua News Agency, July 13th: People from all walks of life in the capital solemnly held a meeting on the afternoon of the 13th to support the resolutions of the International Conference on Relaxation of Tensions.

The meeting was hosted by the China Peace Committee.

The venue was solemn and simple.

On the rostrum were: Guo Moruo, Chairman and Vice-Chairmen of the China Peace Committee, and representatives of the Chinese delegation to the Berlin Special Meeting of the World Peace Council and the Stockholm International Conference on Relaxation of Tensions, Chen Shutong, Mao Dun, Ma Yinchu, Cai Tingkai, Li Zhuchen, Liao Chengzhi, Li Yimang, Chu Tunan, Hua Luogeng, Ji Chao Ding, and Liu Guanyi.

Attending the meeting were: Li Siguang, Shao Lizi, Liang Xi, and other standing committee members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the China Peace Committee, as well as heads of various departments, cadres from various agencies in Beijing and national democratic parties and people's organizations, and people from the capital's scientific, educational, literary, artistic, news, and publishing circles, totaling more than 800 people.

Togo Kameda, Deputy Secretary-General of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Liaison Committee, and foreign peace activists in Beijing also attended the meeting.

The meeting began with an opening speech by Chen Shutong. He said: The International Conference on Relaxation of Tensions held in Stockholm this June achieved significant results. The call for peace issued by the conference and the resolutions and suggestions adopted are entirely in line with the will and aspirations of peace-loving people in all countries of the world. Today, people from all walks of life in our capital are gathering here to endorse and support the resolutions of the International Conference on Relaxation of Tensions. At the same time, the Chinese delegation headed by Comrade Guo Moruo also attended the special meeting of the World Peace Council in Berlin in May. We have specially invited Comrade Guo Moruo, head of the Chinese delegation who attended these two meetings, to report to everyone on the course and achievements of the meetings.

Amidst warm applause, Guo Moruo gave a report to everyone on the Berlin Special Meeting of the World Peace Council and the Stockholm International Conference on Relaxation of Tensions.

Guo Moruo first introduced the course and achievements of the Berlin Special Meeting of the World Peace Council, and then gave a detailed introduction to the situation of the Stockholm International Conference on Relaxation of Tensions. He gave a brief explanation, analysis, and evaluation of the three resolutions and six suggestions unanimously adopted at the meeting. He said that these resolutions and suggestions are in line with the wishes of the Chinese people and the wishes of peace-loving people all over the world. He also gave a detailed introduction to the work and contributions made by the Chinese delegation to the meeting. He said that the speeches of the Chinese delegation at the meeting were warmly welcomed by the representatives of various countries, especially the representatives of Asian countries.

He pointed out the gains and achievements of the two meetings. He said that the two meetings, especially the Stockholm meeting, achieved four significant results: First, the content of the meeting was very rich, and every resolution passed by the meeting met the requirements of the people all over the world. Second, it was beneficial to the development of the Geneva Conference. Third, it expanded the foundation of the peace movement, and the peace movement in all countries of the world has a new atmosphere and new progress. Fourth, it opened up new roads for the peace movement. However, Guo Moruo said again, even if we have achieved such achievements, we should not relax our peace movement. We must further strengthen the peace consultation movement in order to enable the great powers to resolve all international disputes through consultation and reach agreements.

Then, he pointed out several significant phenomena in the international arena, that is: the US war policy is becoming increasingly unpopular, and the US warmongers are becoming increasingly isolated; the people of the world are demanding that agreements be reached through consultation, demanding the prohibition of testing and use of atomic and hydrogen weapons, advocating cultural exchanges and smooth trade between countries, and advocating the People's Republic of China's entry into the United Nations; the peace movement is making great progress, and more and more people are participating in the peace movement; the peace policy is becoming more and more trusted by people; China's international status is becoming more and more valued.

The meeting finally unanimously adopted a resolution in support of the resolutions of the Stockholm International Conference on Relaxation of Tensions.

    大会开始，由陈叔通致开会词。他说：今年六月在斯德哥尔摩召开的缓和局势国际会议获得了重大的成就。会议发出的和平呼声和通过的各项决议与建议，是完全符合全世界各国爱好和平人民的意志与愿望的。今天我们首都各界在这里举行集会，拥护和支持缓和局势国际会议的决议。同时以郭沫若团长为首的中国代表团也曾于五月间出席了柏林世界和平理事会特别会议，我们特邀请出席这两次会议的我国代表团郭沫若团长，给大家报告会议的经过及其成就。
    在热烈的掌声中，郭沫若向大家作了关于世界和平理事会柏林特别会议和斯德哥尔摩缓和局势国际会议的传达报告。
    郭沫若首先介绍了世界和平理事会柏林特别会议的经过及其成就，接着详细地介绍了斯德哥尔摩缓和局势国际会议的情况。他对会议上一致通过的三个决议、六个建议都作了扼要的说明、分析和估价。他说，这些决议和建议都符合中国人民的愿望，也符合全世界爱好和平人民的愿望。他并就中国代表团对会议所作的工作和贡献作了详尽地介绍。他说，中国代表团在会议上的发言，曾受到与会的各国代表，特别是亚洲国家代表们的热烈欢迎。
    他指出了两个会议的收获和成就。他说，两个会议，特别是斯德哥尔摩会议取得了四点显著的成就：第一，会议内容很丰富，会议通过的每一个决议都符合全世界人民的要求。第二，有益于日内瓦会议的发展。第三，扩大了和平运动的基础，全世界各国和平运动有了新的气象，新的进展。第四，为和平运动打开了新的道路。但是，郭沫若又说，我们纵然获得了如此成就，我们对和平运动仍不应松懈，我们必须进一步强化和平协商运动，以期能使大国通过协商解决一切国际争端，并使协商达成协议。
    接着，他又指出目前国际上几点显著现象，这就是：美国战争政策愈来愈不得人心，美国好战分子愈来愈孤立；全世界人民都要求通过协商达成协议，要求禁止试验和使用原子武器、氢武器，主张各国间文化交流、贸易畅通，主张中华人民共和国进入联合国；和平运动在大大前进，参加和平运动的人士愈来愈多；和平政策愈来愈受人们信赖；中国的国际地位愈来愈受人重视。
    大会最后一致通过了拥护斯德哥尔摩缓和局势国际会议决议的决议。
