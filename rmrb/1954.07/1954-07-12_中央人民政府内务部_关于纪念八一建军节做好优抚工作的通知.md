    Notice from the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government on Commemorating the August 1st Army Day and Doing a Good Job in Providing Preferential Treatment

    This year, in commemorating the "August 1st" Army Day, large-scale activities will generally not be held, but the following tasks should be done well:

    I. In addition to cooperating with the stationed troops in holding good "August 1st" celebration meetings and get-togethers, local people's governments above the county level should send cadres to hospitals, schools for disabled revolutionary soldiers, and sanatoriums to offer condolences and congratulations to the sick and wounded soldiers and disabled revolutionary soldiers.

    II. In conjunction with the study and discussion of the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China, publicize the great contributions of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers. On the one hand, raise the legal awareness of cadres and the masses, as well as the families of martyrs, military personnel, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized construction soldiers, and make them feel glorious to perform military service. On the other hand, enhance the patriotism and support-the-army and give-preferential-treatment-to-families-of-soldiers ideology of cadres and the masses, and create more favorable conditions for further improving the work of providing preferential treatment.

    III. Since the Second National Civil Affairs Conference, various regions have made great progress and achieved certain results in mobilizing and organizing the families of martyrs, military personnel, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized construction soldiers to participate in socialist construction and agricultural mutual aid and cooperation organizations to engage in labor production. In addition to making preparations for the autumn and winter selection of models, provinces and cities should report their model production cases and model figures through newspapers.

    IV. In order to increase the production of the families of martyrs and military personnel and the land cultivated on their behalf, various regions should correctly use preferential treatment funds to help solve their difficulties in production and life, and pay special attention to taking care of the families of martyrs and military personnel in severely affected disaster areas.

    V. People's governments above the county level should strengthen their leadership over district and township people's governments. Through the discussion of the Draft Constitution and the "August 1st" publicity, in conjunction with the central work of the locality, properly settle the demobilized construction soldiers who have not yet been settled. At the same time, understand the situation of the families of active military personnel and prepare for receiving and settling new demobilized construction soldiers.

    中央人民政府内务部
    关于纪念八一建军节做好优抚工作的通知
    今年纪念“八一”建军节，一般不进行大的活动，但应做好如下几项工作：
    一、各地县以上人民政府除配合驻军开好“八一”庆祝会、联欢会外，应派干部到医院、革命残废军人学校、教养院向伤病员、革命残废军人进行慰问和祝贺。
    二、结合中华人民共和国宪法草案的学习和讨论，宣传中国人民解放军、中国人民志愿军的伟大贡献，一方面提高干部群众和烈属、军属、革命残废军人、复员建设军人的守法观念和人人有服兵役的光荣感；另一方面提高干部群众爱国主义思想和拥军优属观念，创造进一步做好优抚工作的更有利的条件。
    三、第二次全国民政会议后，各地对动员组织烈属、军属、革命残废军人、复员建设军人参加社会主义建设，参加农业互助合作组织从事劳动生产的工作，都有很大开展并获得一定成绩，各省市除做好准备秋冬评选模范外，应通过报纸报道他们的生产模范事例和模范人物。
    四、为使烈属军属生产和代耕土地增产，各地应正确使用优抚费，帮助解决他们生产生活上的困难，特别注意照顾遭灾较重地区中的烈属军属。
    五、县以上人民政府应加强对区乡人民政府的领导，通过宪法草案的讨论和“八一”宣传，结合当地中心工作，安置好未得到安置的复员建设军人，同时了解现役军人家属情况，为接收安置新复员建设军人做好准备。
