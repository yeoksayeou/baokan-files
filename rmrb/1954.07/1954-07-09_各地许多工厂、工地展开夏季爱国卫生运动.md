Since the beginning of summer, many factories and construction sites in various regions have actively launched summer patriotic health campaigns.

Many factories in the Tianjin Special District have paid attention to improving workers' food and lodging hygiene and environmental sanitation. Workshops and dormitories have been cleaned and ventilation equipment has been added. Canteens ensure that workers do not eat raw or cold food and provide sufficient boiling water. Fly-proof and dust-proof equipment has been added to the kitchens. The Hangu Chemical Plant completely inverted empty hydrochloric acid jars during the cleaning process, eradicating the breeding conditions for mosquitoes. In launching the summer patriotic health campaign, the Taiyuan Shanxi Machine Factory first conducted health publicity work, screening health films, holding health exhibitions, and publicizing methods for preventing summer and autumn infectious diseases; and held lectures on public health and personal hygiene. Screens and bamboo blinds were installed on doors and windows. Canteens, dormitories, and other places were disinfected. Health checks were also conducted on cooks, nannies, and employees' children. The Daye Steel Plant regards the patriotic health campaign as one of the main keys to ensuring the completion of production tasks. In order to make workers' families pay attention to hygiene work, the factory also organized family members to visit high-temperature workshops. The family members were greatly moved after seeing the scene of their husbands working under high temperatures every day. They proposed: While taking good care of the children, they must also do a good job in hygiene. When their husbands come home from work, they do not allow the children to make noise indoors, so that their husbands can get adequate rest.

During the summer patriotic health campaign, the sanitary conditions of many construction sites have also been significantly improved. Most construction sites in Tianjin have established safety and health systems and regular inspection, meeting, and reporting systems. Construction Site 110 organized a health emergency team and established a "three-part form inspection system," which promoted the on-site health work. In order to ensure that workers eat and drink well, most construction sites are actively improving their meals. Many construction sites have set up boiling water stations; most construction sites have also conducted health checks on cooks. Construction Site 307 in Wuhan and its affiliated construction sites schedule safety and health lectures every Thursday noon, and are now beginning to provide hygiene training for cooks.

Harbin, Anshan, Qinhuangdao and other cities conducted sanitary inspections of construction sites in the urban areas. The Harbin Patriotic Health Campaign Committee successively organized eighteen inspection teams with fifty-eight cadres participating, and inspected one hundred and nine construction sites. The Anshan Factory and Construction Site Catering Inspection Team inspected seventy-five canteens. The Qinhuangdao inspection team also inspected six construction sites. From the inspection, it can be seen that the general construction sites attach importance to safety and health work and have achieved some results. (Xinhua News Agency)

    各地许多工厂、工地展开夏季爱国卫生运动
    入夏以来，各地许多工厂，工地积极地开展了夏季爱国卫生运动。
    天津专区的许多工厂都注意了工人的食宿卫生和环境卫生的改善。在车间和宿舍都进行了清扫和增添了通风设备。食堂作到保证工人不吃生饭凉饭，并供给足够的开水。厨房中并添置了防蝇防尘设备。汉沽化工厂在清扫中把盛盐酸的空坛子完全倒置过来，根绝了蚊虫的孳生条件。太原山西机器厂在开展夏季爱国卫生运动中首先进行了卫生宣传工作，放映了卫生影片，举办了卫生展览会，宣传了预防夏秋季传染病的方法；并举办了公共卫生和个人卫生讲座。门窗上都安置了纱窗、竹簾。食堂、宿舍等地并进行了消毒。对炊事员、保姆和职工子弟还进行了健康检查。大冶钢厂将爱国卫生运动作为保证完成生产任务主要关键之一。为了使工人家属重视卫生工作，厂方还组织家属到高温车间参观。家属们看到自己丈夫每日在高温下劳动的情景后，大为感动，她们提出：一面带好孩子，一面还要搞好卫生。当丈夫下班回家后，她们都不让小孩在室内吵闹，使丈夫能够得到充分的休息。
    在夏季爱国卫生运动中，许多工地的卫生状况也有显著改善。天津市大多数工地已建立了安全卫生制度和经常性的检查、会议和汇报制度。一一○工地组织了卫生急救小组，并建立了“三联单检查制”，对现场的卫生工作起了推动作用。为了保证工人吃好、喝好，大多数工地正在积极改善伙食。很多工地都设置了开水站；大多数工地还进行了炊事员的健康检查。武汉市三○七工地及其所属工地定每星期四中午为安全卫生讲座时间，目前又开始对炊事员进行卫生训练。
    哈尔滨、鞍山、秦皇岛等市对市区各工地进行了卫生检查。哈尔滨市爱国卫生运动委员会先后组织了有五十八名干部参加的十八个检查组，检查了一百零九个工地。鞍山市的工厂、工地的膳食检查组检查了七十五个食堂。秦皇岛市的检查组也检查了六个工地。从检查中可以看出，一般工地是重视安全卫生工作的，并取得了一些成绩。　（新华社）
