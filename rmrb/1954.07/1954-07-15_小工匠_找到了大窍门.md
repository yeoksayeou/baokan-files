"Little Craftsman" Finds a Great Trick

    Zhang Zhenhua, a planer operator in the metalworking workshop of the Chief Mechanical Engineer's Office of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, used to think he was just a "little craftsman" (Grade 2) and couldn't find any tricks, so he could only put in more effort. In March of this year, after Du Zihua, an old worker in their group, returned from a visit to Anshan Iron and Steel, and reported on the innovative deeds of the Anshan workers, Zhang Zhenhua felt that his idea was wrong.

    In April, Zhang Zhenhua's task was to plane shafts for small rolling mill automation. He tried to improve the tools and saved marking time, and his work efficiency increased by two and a half times, ensuring the timely completion of spare parts for the small rolling mill automation project. On May 22, their group received another urgent task from the Rolling Mill Department: 1,000 sets of 140-ton high car track screws. Zhang Zhenhua and worker Ma Changde carefully studied and proposed to improve the tool for planing screws. When the comrades in the group heard this news, they all scrambled to help. The next day, they used waste materials and, with the help of all the comrades in the group, modified the screw planing tool. In the past, one screw was planed at a time, and 25 or 26 screws could be planed per shift. After the improvement, twelve screws could be planed at a time, and 120 to 130 screws could be planed per shift, and the work efficiency increased by more than four times.

    “小工匠”找到了大窍门
    太原钢铁厂总机械师室金工车间刨床工人张振华，过去总认为自己是个“小工匠”（二级），找不到什么窍门，只能多出点力气。今年三月里，他们小组老工人杜子华由鞍钢参观回来，报告了鞍钢工人的革新事迹后，张振华才感到自己的想法错了。
    四月份，张振华的任务是刨小型轧钢自动化用的轴，他想办法改进了工具，节省了划线时间，工作效率提高了两倍半，保证了小型轧钢自动化工程备件的及时完成。五月二十二日，他们小组又接到轧钢部的一百四十吨高车跑道螺丝一千套的任务，这种活要得很紧。张振华和工人马昌德便细心研究，提出要改进刨螺丝的工具。小组同志们听到这个消息，都争着帮忙。第二天，他们利用了废料，在全组同志的帮助下，将刨螺丝的工具改成了。过去是一次刨一个，每工刨二十五、六个；改进后一次能刨十二个，每工能刨一百二十个至一百三十个，工作效率提高了四倍多。
