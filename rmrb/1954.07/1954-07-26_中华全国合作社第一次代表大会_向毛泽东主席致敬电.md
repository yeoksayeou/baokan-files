Respected Chairman Mao:

Under the leadership and care of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and yourself, the First National Congress of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives has concluded victoriously. We, all the delegates, extend to you our highest respect and most heartfelt gratitude.

In recent years, the supply and marketing cooperatives and consumer cooperatives, following the path pointed out by the Second Plenary Session of the Party's Seventh Central Committee, have made great progress under the correct leadership of the Party and the government, and with the active assistance of the state-owned economy. In order to further adapt to the needs of national economic construction, our congress, in accordance with the requirements of the general task of the state's transition period as instructed by you, reviewed and summarized the work of the past few years, and determined the basic tasks for the transition period.

Respected Chairman Mao, after this congress, we, all the delegates, have a deeper understanding of the glorious and arduous tasks that cooperatives undertake in the great cause of socialist construction and socialist transformation of the country. We are determined to better unite all members and employees, under the leadership of state-owned commerce, to further develop the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, do a good job in the planned purchase and planned supply entrusted by the state, promote the agricultural production movement centered on mutual aid and cooperation, promote the cooperativization of handicrafts, and actively lead the rural market, and gradually realize the transformation of rural private merchants, so as to support the country's socialist industrialization and consolidate the worker-peasant alliance.

Respected Chairman Mao, following the principle you instructed that "the nature of cooperatives is to serve the masses, that is, to think of the masses everywhere, to plan for the masses, and to put the interests of the masses first," we must closely link with the masses, strengthen the democratic management and mass supervision of cooperatives, and continuously improve the socialist consciousness of the broad masses of members. We must actively carry out supply and marketing business in accordance with national plans and price policies, strive to improve business management, continuously reduce circulation costs, and better serve the members of the masses.

Respected Chairman Mao, under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and yourself, we have the confidence to run the cooperatives well and strive to victoriously complete the tasks of the cooperatives during the transition period.

We wish you good health!

The Entire Delegation of the First National Congress of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives
