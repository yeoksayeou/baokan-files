    Capital Performance of the Play "Thunderstorm"
    "Thunderstorm," one of the excellent plays since China's "May Fourth Movement," has been performed by the Beijing People's Art Theater at the Beijing Theater since June 30th. This performance has attracted the attention of the capital's literary and art circles.
    Cao Yu's masterpiece "Thunderstorm," through the story of what happened in two families, profoundly attacked the darkness of the feudal system and the sinful essence of the bourgeoisie in old China before and after the "May Fourth Movement." It also reflected that China's proletariat, which was growing stronger at that time, had already taken up the spearhead and launched a battle against the target of struggle. The audience can re-recognize the cold, cruel, and decadent spiritual life of the old society in the performance, and feel the happiness of living in the new society, encouraging people to fight more bravely against the remnants of the old society's ideology and build a socialist society.
    The actors and directors participating in this play began preparing for the rehearsal in February this year. They visited people who had experienced the "May Fourth" era and families close to the characters in the play, and read novels before and after the "May Fourth" Movement to familiarize themselves with the social situation and the ideological character of the characters in the play. The script used in this performance has been partially revised by the playwright Cao Yu to make the performance more compact and refined. (Xinhua News Agency)

    首都公演话剧“雷雨”
    我国“五四”以来优秀剧目之一“雷雨”，自六月三十日起由北京人民艺术剧院在北京剧场演出。这次演出引起首都文艺界的重视。
    曹禺的名著“雷雨”，通过两个家庭里发生的故事深刻地抨击了“五四”前后旧中国封建制度的黑暗和资产阶级的罪恶本质，也反映出当时正在成长壮大的我国无产阶级已经拿起矛头对准了斗争对象展开战斗。观众能够在演出中重新认识旧社会的冷酷、残忍和腐朽的精神生活，更显得生活在新社会的幸福，鼓舞人们更勇敢地向旧社会的残余思想进行斗争，建设社会主义社会。
    参加此剧演出的演员和导演，从今年二月间就着手进行排演的准备工作。他们访问了经历过“五四”时代的人和接近剧中人物的家庭，并阅读“五四”前后的小说，熟悉当时的社会情景和剧中人物的思想性格。这次演出用的剧本经剧作者曹禺作了部分修改，使演出更加紧凑精练。（新华社）
