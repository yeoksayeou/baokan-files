Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang—Guizhou Province's local state-owned factories and mines have received support from various new machinery and equipment. This year, the orders placed by various factories and mines with domestic heavy industrial factories include dozens of types of machines, such as lathes, drilling machines, generators, electric motors, air compressors, drilling rigs, water pumps, and boilers, many of which have already been transported to the factories and put into production.

The equipment in Guizhou Province's local state-owned factories and mines is generally relatively backward, and most production processes in many factories and mines are operated manually. After these factories and mines added machines to the weakest links in production, production efficiency improved, and workers' working conditions also improved. In the clinker workshop of the Guiyang Cement Plant, workers used to carry the charge on their backs. Now, after installing a belt conveyor, the labor intensity of the workers has been reduced. Two hours of machine operation is equal to the total transportation volume of twelve workers in one day.

Thanks to the supply of machinery from heavy industrial factories, many production processes in some newly built and expanded factories and mines in Guizhou Province will be machine-operated. The Zunyi Phosphate Fertilizer Plant, which is currently being expanded, has received air compressors, ball mills, crushers and other machinery and equipment manufactured in Chongqing and other places. After this, the plant will use machines for all production processes except mining, and the output will be greatly increased.

After obtaining new machinery and equipment, Guizhou Province's local state-owned factories and mines can also smoothly conduct trial production and produce new products. The various machinery and equipment required by the local state-owned Zunyi Ferroalloy Plant for the production of silicon-manganese alloys and low-carbon ferromanganese, such as steel plates, refractory bricks, magnesia, transformers, and overhead cranes for new furnaces, are now being rushed to manufacture and transferred from factories in Northeast China, Shanghai and other places. After these equipments are installed in the factory, the factory can officially produce silicon-manganese alloys and low-carbon ferromanganese for the country.

    贵州省各厂矿添置新机器生产效率提高
    【新华社贵阳讯】贵州省各地方国营厂矿得到各地一些新的机器设备的支援。今年各厂矿向国内各重工业工厂订货中，有车床、钻床、发电机、电动机、空气压缩机、钻探机、水泵、锅炉等几十种，其中许多机器已经运到工厂并投入了生产。
    贵州省各地方国营厂矿的设备一般都比较落后，许多厂矿大部分生产过程都用人工操作。这些厂矿在生产最薄弱的环节添设了机器后，生产效率提高了，工人劳动条件也有了改善。贵阳水泥厂的熟料车间，过去加料都是工人背抬。现在安装了皮带运输机后，减轻了工人的劳动强度，机器运转两小时，就等于十二个工人一天运输量的总和。
    贵州省今年新建和扩建的一些厂矿，由于得到各重工业工厂的机器供应，许多生产过程都将是机器操作的。正在扩建的遵义磷肥厂，得到重庆等地制造的空气压缩机、球磨机、碎矿机等机器设备后，这个厂除采矿外，其他生产过程都是机器生产，产量将大大提高。
    贵州省各地方国营厂矿获得新的机器设备后，还可顺利地进行试制和生产新产品。地方国营遵义锰铁厂生产矽锰合金和低炭锰铁所需的各种机器设备，如新建熔炉的钢板、耐火砖、镁砂和变压器、起重行车等，现在正由东北、上海等地的工厂赶制和调运中。这些设备到厂安装完成后，这个厂就可正式为国家生产矽锰合金和低炭锰铁。
