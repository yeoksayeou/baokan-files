After twenty-three days of work, the delegation of the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army and the delegation of the General Command of the French Union Forces in Indochina have achieved the following concrete results:

1.  Carefully studied the various practical ways to implement the ceasefire in Vietnam. As a result of this study, the ceasefire order has been implemented in northern Vietnam today, and will be implemented in central and southern Vietnam according to the scheduled date.

2.  Specifically discussed the implementation of the agreement on the issue of prisoners of war at the Geneva Military Conference, and consequently, the two sides have reached an agreement on ways to improve the lives of prisoners of war and guarantee the repatriation of sick and wounded prisoners of war.

Due to the joint efforts of the two delegations, the Zhongjia Military Conference has achieved good results, creating a favorable atmosphere for the ceasefire, thereby contributing to the success of the Geneva Conference.

From now on, it will be the task of the Joint Commission to ensure the implementation of the ceasefire agreements signed in Geneva.

    从今天、一九五四年七月二十七日上午开始，在日内瓦签订的停止敌对行动协定在越南的北部实行。同样从今天起，在印度支那其他一切战场上的军事活动将受到限制，以达到一九五四年八月十一日的完全停止。这样，在一九五四年七月四日开幕的中稼军事会议的使命已经完成，应该结束它的工作了。经过二十三天的工作以后，越南人民军总司令部代表团和印度支那法兰西联邦部队总司令部代表团已获得如下的具体成果：
    一、仔细地研究了关于实现越南停火的各种实际办法。由于这种研究，停火命令今天得以在越南北部实现，并将按预定日期在越南的中部和南部实现。
    二、具体地讨论了在日内瓦的军事会议关于战俘问题的协议的执行，因而，双方已就关于改善战俘生活、保证遣返病伤战俘的办法达成了协议。
    由于双方代表团的共同努力，中稼军事会议已获得良好的结果，为停战造成了有利的气氛，从而对日内瓦会议的成功有所贡献。
    从今以后，使日内瓦所签订的停战协定得到执行，将是联合委员会的任务。
