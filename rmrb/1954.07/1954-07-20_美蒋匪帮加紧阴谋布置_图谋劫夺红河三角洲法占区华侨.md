    The US-Chiang Kai-shek Clique Intensifies Conspiracy
    Plotting to Kidnap Overseas Chinese in French-Occupied Areas of the Red River Delta
   The Kuomintang remnant group in Taiwan, under the control of the United States, is currently intensifying its conspiracy to forcibly transport large numbers of overseas Chinese from the French-occupied areas of the Red River Delta in Vietnam to Taiwan. For this purpose, the Kuomintang remnant forces in Taiwan have dispatched a "special committee member" to the French military occupation zone of the Red River Delta and will continue to send another group of people there on the 19th. This "special committee member," who has already arrived in Haiphong, is working with the original personnel of the Kuomintang remnant group stationed in Haiphong and Hanoi to intimidate, coerce, and deceive local overseas Chinese, urging them to "withdraw" to Taiwan and become vagrants. At the same time, Chennault's "Civil Air Transport," an air pirate company, dispatched a transport plane from Taiwan to Haiphong on the 16th and will continue to dispatch another transport plane on the 19th to assist Chiang Kai-shek's bandits in kidnapping overseas Chinese from Hanoi to Haiphong. Then, Chiang's bandits will use ships to kidnap these people, along with local overseas Chinese in Haiphong, to Taiwan. According to Reuters, several ships will travel from Taiwan to Haiphong within a few days. The report stated that these conspiratorial arrangements by the Kuomintang remnant group have been approved by the French authorities in Vietnam.
    The Kuomintang remnant group's plan to kidnap overseas Chinese particularly focuses on young overseas Chinese students. The Kuomintang remnant group openly stated that it would first kidnap young students and announced a "study plan" for students going to Taiwan. In the past, when the Kuomintang bandits were fighting the civil war on the Chinese mainland, they used "studying" to lure young students into traps and use them as cannon fodder. Now, they continue to use this trick to lure overseas Chinese to Taiwan to replenish their depleted remnant bandit army.
    However, the Kuomintang remnant group's conspiracy is being exposed by many local overseas Chinese. A Reuters report on the 16th stated that among the more than 40,000 overseas Chinese living in the Red River Delta, including Hanoi, fewer than a handful have indicated a willingness to be transported away under duress.

    美蒋匪帮加紧阴谋布置
    图谋劫夺红河三角洲法占区华侨
   【新华社十九日讯】在美国控制下的台湾国民党残余集团最近正在加紧阴谋布置，企图从越南红河三角洲目前法占区内把华侨大批劫运到台湾去。为了这一目的，台湾国民党残余势力已派出了一个“专门委员”到红河三角洲法军占领区去，并将在十九日继续派出一批人去。这个已经到达海防的“专门委员”正和国民党残余集团原来驻海防、河内的人员一起，对当地的华侨进行恐吓、胁迫和欺骗，要他们“撤退”到台湾去当流浪者。与此同时，美国空中强盗陈纳德的“民用航空运输公司”在十六日从台湾派出一架运输机去海防，十九日还将继续派出另一架运输机去协助蒋匪把河内的华侨劫运到海防。然后蒋匪将把这些人和海防当地华侨一起用轮船劫往台湾。据路透社消息，在几天之内就将有若干船只从台湾前往海防。消息说，国民党残余集团的这些阴谋布置，得到了越南法国当局的同意。
    国民党残余集团劫夺华侨的计划中特别注重于青年华侨学生。国民党残余集团公开表示将首先劫运青年学生，并宣布了一个学生到台湾后的“升学办法”。国民党匪帮过去在中国大陆上打内战时曾用“升学”来把青年学生骗入圈套以充当炮灰，现在又继续施用这个诡计来诱骗海外华侨到台湾去，来补充他们兵源枯竭的残余匪军。
    但是，国民党残余集团的阴谋正为当地许多华侨所识破。路透社十六日消息报道，住在红河三角洲包括河内的华侨四万余人，其中在胁迫之下表示愿意被运走的连零数都不到。
