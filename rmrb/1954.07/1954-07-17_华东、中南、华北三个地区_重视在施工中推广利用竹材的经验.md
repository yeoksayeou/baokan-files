East China, Central South, and North China Regions Emphasize the Experience of Promoting and Utilizing Bamboo in Construction, saving timber for the country.

The utilization of bamboo in construction has become relatively common in East China. Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have widely adopted it, while Anhui, Shandong, and Fujian provinces have formulated plans to promote the utilization of bamboo. The Shandong Provincial Construction Engineering Bureau has focused on experimenting with the use of bamboo in Qingdao, training bamboo workers, summarizing experiences, and gradually promoting its use. They will also gradually replace all scaffolding with bamboo while ensuring that the quality of the project is not affected. On the basis of promoting the use of bamboo sheds and bamboo frames in 1953, the Fujian Provincial Construction Engineering Bureau plans to use 22,500 square meters of bamboo sheds and 48,000 square meters of bamboo frames this year. The Anhui Provincial Construction Engineering Bureau has sent special personnel to the southern Anhui production area to purchase moso bamboo, using bamboo scaffolding and bamboo sheds in projects, and engaging in the training of bamboo workers. The utilization of bamboo is also relatively common in Central South China. Guangxi Province has universally adopted bamboo sheds and can guarantee quality. According to calculations there, the cost per square meter of building area is 30,000 yuan cheaper using bamboo sheds than using pine sheds, and the labor cost per square meter of building area is 1,500 yuan cheaper for bamboo shed workers than for wooden shed workers. In Guangdong, bamboo is generally used for sheds and scaffolding, and some thirteen-story buildings even use bamboo scaffolding. According to the Wuhan No. 2 Engineering Company's calculation of the cost of labor and materials per square meter, bamboo scaffolding sheds are more than 66,000 yuan cheaper than wooden scaffolding sheds. In order to promote the utilization of bamboo in construction, the North China Construction Engineering Bureau has issued instructions to its subordinate provinces, cities, and directly subordinate engineering companies, requiring that temporary projects should make full use of bamboo. Bamboo scaffolding should be universally promoted first in low-rise buildings (three stories) below 15 meters, and a small number of professional bamboo workers should be trained in a planned manner.

The Central Ministry of Construction Engineering recently issued a circular regarding the promotion and utilization of bamboo in the above three regions, requesting its subordinate units to actively promote the experience of utilizing bamboo in the above regions in order to save timber for the country and accumulate capital.

    华东、中南、华北三个地区
    重视在施工中推广利用竹材的经验
    华东、中南、华北三个地区重视在施工中推广利用竹材的经验，为国家节省了木材。
    华东地区在施工中对于竹材的利用已比较普遍。江苏、浙江两省已广泛采用，安徽、山东、福建三省已作出了关于推广利用竹材的计划。山东省建筑工程局已在青岛重点试验使用竹材，培养竹工，总结经验，逐步推广，并在不影响工程质量的原则下，逐步将全部脚手架换成竹材。福建省建筑工程局在一九五三年推广使用竹篷和竹架的基础上，今年计划使用竹篷二万二千五百平方公尺，竹架四万八千平方公尺。安徽省建筑工程局已派专人赴皖南产区采购毛竹，在工程中使用竹脚手及竹工棚，并从事培养竹工。中南地区对竹材的利用也较普遍。广西省已普遍采用竹工棚，并能保证质量。根据该地计算结果，每平方公尺建筑面积的造价，用竹工棚比用松木工棚节省三万元，每平方公尺建筑面积所需的工资，竹棚工比木棚工节省一千五百元。广东一般工棚脚手都用竹材，有的十三层楼房都用竹脚手。武汉市第二工程公司对每平方公尺的工料成本的计算结果，用竹架工棚比用木架工棚低六万六千余元。华北建筑工程局为了在施工中推广利用竹材，已对所属省、市、直属工程公司等发出指示，要求一般暂设工程充分利用竹材，先在十五公尺以下的低层建筑物（三层）中普遍推广竹脚手，并要求有计划的培养少数专业竹工。
    中央建筑工程部对于目前上述三个地区推广利用竹材问题，最近发出通报，要求所属单位积极推广上述地区利用竹材的经验，为国家节约木材，积累资金。
