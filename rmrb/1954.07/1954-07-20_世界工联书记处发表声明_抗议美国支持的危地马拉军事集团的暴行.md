Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, July 18th: The Secretariat of the World Federation of Trade Unions issued a statement to the press protesting the terror campaign launched by the Guatemalan military clique against Guatemalan workers after seizing power.

The statement said that forty-five trade union leaders and Felix Moreno, General Secretary of the United Fruit Company Workers' Union, and other trade union leaders had been murdered. The World Federation of Trade Unions indignantly protested against the crimes committed by the executioners. All workers knew the people who had in fact committed these crimes – the United Fruit Company and the American ruling clique – and condemned their shamelessness.

The statement pointed out that the Guatemalan Workers' Confederation and the Guatemalan National Agricultural Workers' Confederation had been declared illegal. Land reform had been abolished. Land had been forcibly taken from peasants and handed over to American monopoly capital and large landowners. This was in effect an unprecedented attack on all trade union rights and democratic rights.

The statement said that the World Federation of Trade Unions believed that all workers and trade union organizations would lodge serious protests against the American ruling clique and their lackeys in Guatemala, and would demand an immediate end to the massacres, the release of all political prisoners, respect for the right of asylum of those who had fled to foreign embassies and legations, and the restoration of trade union rights and democratic freedoms.

    抗议美国支持的危地马拉军事集团的暴行
   【新华社十九日讯】据塔斯社维也纳十八日讯：世界工会联合会书记处向报界发表声明。抗议危地马拉军事集团在夺取了政权以后对危地马拉工人所发动的恐怖运动。
    声明说，四十五个工会领袖和联合果品公司工人工会总书记费利克斯·摩伦诺和其他工会领袖都遭到杀害。世界工会联合会愤慨抗议刽子手所犯的这种罪行。所有工人都知道事实上犯了这些罪行的人们——联合果品公司和美国统治集团——并谴责他们的无耻。
    声明指出，危地马拉工人联合会和危地马拉全国农业工人联合会已被宣布非法。土地改革已被废除。土地已用强力从农民那里夺去，交给美国垄断资本和大地主。这实际上是对所有工会权利和民主权利的空前进攻。
    声明说，世界工会联合会相信，所有工人和工会组织将对美国统治集团和他们在危地马拉的走狗提出严重的抗议，并将要求立即停止屠杀、释放所有的政治犯、遵守那些逃到外国公使馆和大使馆去的人们的避难权利和恢复工会权利和民主自由。
