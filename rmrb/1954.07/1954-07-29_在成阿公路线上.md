	On the Cheng-Aba Highway
	Wang Zhizhong
	The road construction project on the Cheng (Du) - Aba (Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture) Highway has crossed the 4,300-meter-high Zhegu Mountain and reached Shuajin Temple, the seat of the Sichuan Tibetan Autonomous Region People's Government.

	Wherever the highway reaches, the economic life of the people there changes. Take Xuecheng as an example: after the road opened, the state-owned trading company purchased a large quantity of local specialties for export, and at the same time, promptly transported in the necessities for the local people's production and life. Before the road opened, local prickly ash sold for 11,000 yuan per jin, and musk sold for 80,000 yuan per liang. After the road opened, prickly ash sold for 28,500 yuan per jin, and musk sold for 198,500 yuan per liang. Before the road opened, imported ironware (farm tools) cost 8,500 yuan per jin, rice cost 5,500 yuan per jin, and salt cost 3,500 yuan per jin. After the road opened, ironware sold for 4,000 yuan per jin, rice sold for 1,300 yuan per jin, and salt sold for 2,300 yuan per jin.

	Shanjiao Dam was just a place name before the highway was opened, without a single house to be seen. Now, along both banks of the Zagunao River, new wooden houses and white tents form two streets. The trading company has set up two sales stations here, one supplying non-staple foods and the other supplying general merchandise. The Tibetan people can buy their favorite woolen clothes, teacups, notebooks, rubber shoes, and other items here. The Grain Bureau has a sales team here, supplying rice, flour, and soybeans, and the front door is always surrounded by a group of fraternal ethnic people from all over. The Chengdu Transportation Company station, the Tax Bureau, the Post and Telecommunications Bureau, the Xinhua Bookstore, and the People's Dining Hall have all been established here.

	According to a comrade working at the Shanjiao Dam Grain Bureau sales station: One day, a Tibetan old man bought twenty jin of rice. He told the translator that generations of his family had never tasted rice. He said: "Chairman Mao is truly better than our parents!"

    在成阿公路线上
    王志锺
    成（都）阿（坝）公路的筑路工程已越过拔海四千三百公尺的鹧鸪山，到达四川省藏族自治区人民政府所在地——刷金寺。
    公路通到那里，那里人民的经济生活就起了变化。拿薛城来说吧：通车后，国营贸易公司一面大量收购土特产外运，一面又及时运进当地人民生产、生活上的必需品，通车前土产花椒卖一万一千元一斤，麝香卖八万元一两，通车后花椒卖二万八千五百元一斤，麝香卖十九万八千五百元一两；通车前外来铁器（农具）每斤八千五百元，大米每斤五千五百元，食盐三千五百元一斤；通车后，铁器一斤卖四千元，大米一斤卖一千三百元，食盐一斤卖二千三百元。
    山脚坝在公路未通车前只是一个地名，看不见一间房屋。现在，沿着杂谷脑河两岸，新的木房子和白色的帐棚组成了两条街。贸易公司在这里设立两处推销站，一处供应副食品，一处供应百货。藏族人民可以在这里买到自己喜欢的绒衣、茶杯、日记本、胶鞋等东西。粮食局在这里设有推销组，供应大米、面粉、黄豆，门前总是围着一群来自各地的兄弟民族人民。国营四川省成都运输公司车站、税务局、邮电局、新华书店、人民食堂都在这里成立起来了。
    据在山脚坝粮食局推销站工作的一位同志谈：有一天，有位藏族老人买了二十斤大米，他告诉通司说，他们家里多少代的人都没有尝过米味，他说：“毛主席真正胜过爹娘！”
