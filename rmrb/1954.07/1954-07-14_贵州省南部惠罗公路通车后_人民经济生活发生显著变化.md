    Significant Changes in People's Economic Life After the Opening of the Huiluo Highway in Southern Guizhou
    Since the opening of the Hui (shui) Luo (dian) Highway in southern Guizhou Province in July last year, the economic life of the Buyi Autonomous Region in Luodian County has undergone significant changes. According to statistics from the Autonomous Region's mass transportation station, from August of last year to the end of June this year, the local and special products transported out of the mountains along this highway by horse-drawn carts and flatbed carts alone amounted to more than 520,000 jin, while salt, cloth, and other daily necessities transported into the mountains reached more than 590,000 jin. After the opening of the highway, transportation costs were reduced, and the price difference between industrial and agricultural products was narrowed. Currently, the prices of industrial products are generally 7% lower than before the highway opened, and the prices of local and special products have also increased appropriately. This year, the planting area of industrial raw material crops such as cotton, ramie, and sugarcane in Luodian has expanded compared to last year. In Fengting Township, the main cotton-producing area, the cotton fields have expanded by more than one-third compared to last year.
    The Buyi Autonomous Region in Luodian County is rich in grain, tung oil, cotton, ramie, and various fruits and vegetables. Before the highway opened, due to transportation difficulties in the mountainous area, many materials could not be transported out. Last year in early May, more than 20,000 jin of green peppers rotted in Bianyang Town along the highway. Now, automobiles, horse-drawn carts, and flatbed carts loaded with materials travel along the highway every day. (Xinhua News Agency)

    贵州省南部惠罗公路通车后
    人民经济生活发生显著变化
    贵州省南部惠（水）罗（甸）公路自去年七月通车以来，已使罗甸县布依族自治区人民的经济生活发生了重大变化。据自治区群众运输站的统计，从去年八月到今年六月底，仅仅由马车、板车沿着这条山区公路运出的土产特产品，就有五十二万多斤，运进山区的盐巴、布匹及其他日用百货达五十九万多斤。公路通车后，减低了运输成本，缩小了工农业产品的差价，目前工业品价格一般比通车前降低百分之七，土产特产的价格也适当提高了。今年罗甸的棉花、青麻、甘蔗等工业原料作物的种植面积，都比去年扩大，主要产棉区的凤亭乡棉田比去年扩大三分之一以上。
    罗甸县布依族自治区盛产粮食、桐油、棉花、青麻和各种水果、蔬菜。在公路通车前，因为山区运输困难，许多物资运不出去，去年五月初公路线上的边阳镇就有二万多斤青辣椒腐烂了。现在，公路上满载物资的汽车、马车、板车等每天络绎不绝。（新华社）
