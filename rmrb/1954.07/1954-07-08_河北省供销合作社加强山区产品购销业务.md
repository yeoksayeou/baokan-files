Hebei Province Supply and Marketing Cooperative Strengthens Purchasing and Selling of Mountain Products

Mountainous areas of Hebei Province produce large quantities of dried and fresh fruits, mountain goods, and medicinal materials, which are important sources of livelihood for the people in these areas. Some of these products are also important export commodities for the country. In May, the Hebei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative issued instructions requiring all subordinate supply and marketing cooperatives to earnestly carry out the purchasing and selling of mountain products. At the same time, it formulated a year-round plan for purchasing mountain products and proposed measures to improve business operations.

Currently, the Hebei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative's purchasing and selling of mountain products is gradually being developed. The Tongxian Special District Office of the Hebei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative recently established four dried fruit processing factories in Changping, Pinggu, Shunyi, and other counties to process apricot preserves, peach preserves, pear preserves, jujube preserves, etc., which increased the purchase volume of fruits. Cooperatives in Handan, Xingtai, Shijiazhuang, Baoding, Tongxian, and other special districts have recently established medicinal material processing factories, and also widely established medicinal material purchasing points in medicinal material producing areas. In early June, the supply and marketing cooperatives in Zhangjiakou and Tangshan special districts had already purchased 1.28 million catties of various medicinal materials. At the same time, cooperatives at all levels actively carried out the work of selling mountain products. At the recent North China Region State-Owned Commerce and Cooperatives Internal Native Products Exchange Meeting, the province sold more than 53 million catties of various dried and fresh mountain goods and more than 1.9 million catties of various medicinal materials, with a total value of more than 160 billion yuan.

    河北省供销合作社加强山区产品购销业务
    河北省山区出产大宗干鲜果品和山货药材，是山区人民重要的生活来源，有些产品还是国家重要的出口物资。河北省供销合作总社在五月间曾发出指示，要求所属各级供销合作社认真作好山区产品的收购和销售工作；同时制定了全年收购山区产品的计划，提出了改进经营方法的措施。
    目前，河北省供销合作社的山区产品购销业务正在逐步开展。河北省供销合作总社通县专区办事处最近在昌平、平谷、顺义等县设立了四处果脯加工厂，就地加工杏脯、桃脯、梨脯、枣脯等，增加了果品收购量。邯郸、邢台、石家庄、保定、通县等专区的合作社最近建立了药材加工厂，同时在产药区普遍设立了药材收购点。张家口、唐山两专区的供销合作社在六月上旬已收购各种药材一百二十八万斤。各级合作社同时积极进行了销售山区产品的工作。在最近召开的华北区国营商业和合作社内部土特产交流会上，该省即销出各种干鲜山货五千三百多万斤，各种药材一百九十多万斤，总值一千六百余亿元。（张庆霖　戚连振）
