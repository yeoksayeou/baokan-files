Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, July 3rd: Our special correspondent reports: It has been about ten days since the heads of the delegations left Geneva one after another. During this period, the task of the delegations is to overcome differences and seek further alignment of positions, so as to formulate proposals as soon as possible for the foreign ministers to consider when they return. Currently, the restricted meetings of the delegations are continuing to discuss the issue of ceasefire supervision, and later, the issue of political solutions necessary to ensure lasting peace in Indochina will be discussed. At the same time, the directly involved parties will also strengthen contact during this period to submit recommendations to the foreign ministers on issues such as determining the areas of concentration of both sides' forces in Indochina as soon as possible.

Developments over the past week have proven that the delegations of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Soviet Union, and China have made active and patient efforts to seek progress in the conference. The Soviet delegation made constructive proposals at the restricted meeting on June 25th. The Soviet delegation proposed that a more restricted meeting be held by the current heads of delegations to discuss in detail the various proposals regarding ceasefire supervision, determine which issues can be agreed upon in principle, and leave the details to be studied by experts. This proposal by the Soviet delegation, as well as the views expressed by the Chinese delegation at the meeting on the same day, were seen as an expression of a sincere desire to resolve the issue. The comprehensive views expressed by the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam at the June 29th meeting on the goals, guiding principles, and powers of ceasefire supervision were similarly praised by all parties. Agence France-Presse, in a June 29th report, believed that the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam "in fact put forward very detailed and careful proposals worthy of serious study."

Due to the efforts of the delegations of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Soviet Union, and China, the positions of both sides have gradually shown more points of convergence.

So far, the debate on the issue of ceasefire supervision has focused on two aspects: one is the issue of the powers and interrelationship between the Joint Supervisory Commission and the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission; the other is the issue of the composition and internal voting procedures of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission.

Regarding the issue of the powers and interrelationship between the Joint Commission and the Neutral Nations Commission, the Chinese delegation has long pointed out that the differences in the issue of interrelationship should be overcome by defining the scope of authority. The French delegation has also expressed that the issue of defining authority should be discussed in detail. In fact, there are no significant differences between the detailed proposals made by the Soviet delegation on the issue of authority on June 14th and the French delegation's views in this regard; it's just that the Soviet delegation's proposals are more detailed and complete. Therefore, it is not difficult to specifically define the scope of authority of the two institutions by using the Soviet delegation's proposals as a basis for entering into detailed discussions, while taking into account the views of other delegations. With the scope of authority clearly defined, the issue of the relationship between the two institutions will naturally be easily resolved. Since the French delegation stated at the June 25th meeting that it was not necessary to use the term "subordination" to express the relationship between the two institutions, it has, in effect, recognized that the relationship between the two institutions should be one of parallel division of labor rather than subordination.

Regarding how to implement the recommendations of the Neutral Nations Commission, the Soviet delegation has expressed opposition to the view that the Neutral Nations Commission should have armed forces, because this would be equivalent to violating the sovereignty of Vietnam and would lead to the recurrence of war. In this regard, the French delegation's views have also gradually approached those of the Soviet delegation, and the French delegation has recently stated that it does not agree with the view that the Neutral Nations Commission should have armed forces.

As for the issue of the composition and internal voting procedures of the Neutral Nations Commission, there are still considerable differences between the views of the two sides. In its revised proposal on June 16th, the Soviet delegation took into account the wishes of some Western countries and proposed that the meeting could choose to have three or two Colombo Conference countries participate in the Neutral Nations Commission; on the issue of voting procedures, the Soviet delegation proposed that the principle of unanimous voting and the method of majority voting should be appropriately divided and coordinated. However, Western countries have not shown the same positive attitude in these areas. They are neither willing to agree to the reasonable and realistic proposals put forward by the Soviet Union, nor can they put forward any new constructive proposals themselves. This attitude of Western countries is naturally not conducive to the progress of the conference.

The opinions of both sides have shown more points of convergence than before on several important issues, while there are still considerable differences on other important issues that need to be overcome. This is the current situation of the restricted conference. As the delegations of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Soviet Union, and China have repeatedly pointed out, as long as both sides act in a spirit of reconciliation, use the existing common ground as the basis for further negotiations, and earnestly seek solutions acceptable to everyone, then differences are by no means insurmountable. Reaching an agreement on the issue of ceasefire supervision should be entirely possible.

However, while looking forward to the prospects of the conference, people must not relax their vigilance in the slightest. Indeed, the skies over Lake Geneva are not entirely cloudless. The forces hostile to peace have never stopped their dark activities to obstruct the reaching of an agreement at the conference.

Before Smith even left Geneva, Western newspapers widely spread the rumor that if the Geneva Conference reached an agreement, the US delegation would "disassociate" itself from the agreement. This means that the United States will reserve the right to undermine the agreement. Smith's final instructions to his deputy Johnson before leaving are particularly thought-provoking. What Smith asked Johnson to do was: "Hold the line." What "line" should be "held"? Of course, it is the "line" of obstructing the reaching of an agreement at the conference. Developments over the past week have proven that this Johnson is indeed using every means to carry out the mission entrusted to him by his superiors.

Those who pay attention to the progress of the conference have pointed out that what Johnson has said in recent meetings is hardly anything new compared to what his superiors said a few weeks ago. Johnson is still tirelessly repeating the platitude that the ceasefire must be supervised by the United Nations, although this statement has long been discredited in the discussion process, and even other Western countries have stopped mentioning it. Another favorite saying of Johnson's is to slander the experience of the Neutral Nations supervising the Korean armistice, although even the French delegation considered it necessary to state at a recent meeting that the conference "must take into account the experience of other places." This is how Johnson is carrying out the mission of "holding the line."

However, the US's activities to obstruct the progress of the conference are by no means limited to this. Western newspapers widely spread the rumor that the United States is stepping up pressure behind the scenes on the French government not to accept an honorable solution that is beneficial to both sides. Reuters revealed that other Western countries were originally prepared to agree to the Soviet delegation's proposal to hold a more restricted meeting to discuss the issue of ceasefire supervision, but under pressure from the US delegation, they decided to "temporarily" not accept this proposal.

One of the main tools used by the United States to obstruct the reaching of an agreement at the conference is the Bao Dai group. A correspondent for "France-Soir" said in a June 29th dispatch that Bao Dai's representatives "make no secret" that they will refuse to accept any agreement that the conference may reach. The reporter then wrote: "But when you ask them, what are you going to do? Wage war on your own? They express the hope that the United States, which seems to have encouraged them in this regard, will give them weapons and instructions so that they can quickly form an army capable of conquering the Viet Minh." The reporter concluded:

"It seems very likely that if they refuse to accept the terms of the agreement, as they threaten, they will receive the support of another delegation, namely the US delegation."

Encouraged by the United States, the Bao Dai government openly sabotaged the direct talks between the two sides decided by the Geneva Conference. Just as the local talks between the two sides were about to begin, the newly appointed Bao Dai Prime Minister Ngo Dinh Diem clamored that he would establish a "permanent war cabinet" in North Vietnam in order to create an atmosphere unfavorable to negotiations.

The issue is no longer clearer: whether the delegations can complete their tasks during this period and whether they can provide the foreign ministers with the necessary conditions to reach a full agreement when they return depends on crushing the artificial obstacles set up by the United States, whether openly or secretly. As a party involved, the French government, as long as it resolutely breaks free from US pressure, will play an important role in the progress of the conference.

### 印度支那问题限制性会议的最近情况

    印度支那问题限制性会议的最近情况
   【新华社日内瓦三日电】本社特派记者报道：自从各国代表团团长先后离开日内瓦以来，至今已有十天左右了。各国代表团在此期间的任务是克服分歧，谋求双方立场的进一步接近，以便早日拟出建议，供将来外长们回来时考虑。目前各国代表团的限制性会议正在继续讨论停战监察问题，以后还要讨论为保障印度支那持久和平所必需的政治解决问题。同时，直接有关双方在此期间也将加强接触，以便就早日在印度支那确定双方部队集结地区等问题向外长们提出建议。
    一个多星期来的发展证明，越南民主共和国、苏联和中国的代表团为谋求会议进展，进行了主动的耐心的努力。苏联代表团在六月二十五日限制性会议上提出了建设性的建议。苏联代表团提议由当前的各代表团团长举行限制性更大的会议，以详细讨论关于停战监察问题的各项建议，确定哪些问题可在原则上达成协议，并将细节交由专家们研究。苏联代表团的这个建议以及中国代表团在同日会议上所发表的意见，被认为是真诚谋求解决问题的表现。越南民主共和国代表团在六月二十九日会议上就停战监察的目标、指导原则、职权等问题所发表的全面意见，同样受到了各方舆论的赞扬。法新社在六月二十九日的报道中认为，越南民主共和国代表团“事实上提出了值得认真研究的、很详尽的、很仔细的建议”。
    由于越南民主共和国、苏联和中国的代表团的这种努力，双方的立场已经逐渐出现了更多可以接近的地方。
    在停战监察的问题上迄今争论集中在两方面：一方面是联合监督委员会和中立国监察委员会的职权和相互关系的问题；一方面是中立国监察委员会的成员和内部表决程序的问题。
    关于联合委员会和中立国委员会的职权和相互关系的问题，中国代表团早就指出过，应该拿职权范围的划分来克服相互关系问题上的分歧。法国代表团也曾表示过应该详细讨论划分职权的问题。事实上，苏联代表团在六月十四日就职权问题提出的详尽建议和法国代表团在这方面的意见并没有重大的分歧，只是苏联代表团的建议更加详尽和完备，因此以苏联代表团的建议为基础进入细节的讨论，同时考虑到其他代表团的意见，就不难具体地划定两个机构的职权范围。职权范围划分清楚了，两个机构的关系问题自然也就不难解决。由于法国代表团在六月二十五日会议上已经表示，没有必要用隶属的字样来表达两个机构的关系，这就在事实上承认了两个机构的关系应该是平行分工而非隶属的原则。
    在如何执行中立国委员会建议的问题上，苏联代表团曾表示反对那种主张中立国委员会应拥有武装力量的意见，因为这就等于违反越南的主权，并将导致战争的再起。在这方面，法国代表团的意见也已逐步靠近了苏联代表团的意见，法国代表团最近也表示不同意中立国委员会应拥有武装力量的说法。
    至于中立国委员会的成员和内部表决程序问题，双方的意见迄今还存在着相当的分歧。苏联代表团在六月十六日的修正建议中照顾了某些西方国家的愿望，提出由三个或两个科伦坡会议国家参加中立国委员会的办法供会议选择；在表决程序问题上，苏联代表团提议把一致表决的原则和多数表决方法加以适当的划分和配合。然而西方国家在这些方面却没有表现出同样的积极态度。他们既不愿同意苏联提出的合理而又现实的建议，同时自己也提不出任何新的建设性的建议来。西方国家的这种态度自然是不利于会议的进展的。
    在若干重要问题上，双方的意见已出现了较前更多可以接近的地方，而在另外一些重要问题上还存在着相当的分歧有待克服，这就是目前限制性会议的情况。正如越南民主共和国、苏联和中国的代表团所一再指出的，只要双方都本着和解的精神，以现有的共同点作为进一步商谈的基础，认真谋求大家都能接受的解决办法，那么分歧就决不是不可克服的。在停战监察问题上达成协议应该是完全有可能的。
    然而人们在瞻望会议前景的同时，决不能丝毫放松警惕。的确，莱蒙湖畔的上空并不是万里无云的。敌视和平的力量一时一刻也没有停止过他们阻挠会议达成协议的黑暗活动。
    在史密斯还没有离开日内瓦的时候，西方报纸就盛传，如果日内瓦会议达成协议，美国代表团将和这个协议“脱离关系”。这就是说，美国将保留破坏这个协议的权利。史密斯临走时给他的副手约翰逊的最后指示，是特别耐人寻味的。史密斯要求约翰逊的是：“守住阵地”。“守住”什么“阵地”呢？当然是阻挠会议达成协议的“阵地”。一个多星期来的发展证明，这个约翰逊确实是在用着一切办法来执行上级所托付给他的使命。
    注意会议进展的人士指出，约翰逊在近来几次会议上所说的话比起几个星期以前他的上级所说过的话，几乎没有任何新的东西。约翰逊直到现在还不厌其烦地重复着必须由联合国来监察停战的滥调，虽然这个说法早已在讨论过程中遭到破产，甚至其他西方国家都已不再提起了。约翰逊另一句最喜欢说的话就是诬蔑中立国监察朝鲜停战的经验，虽然连法国代表团都在最近一次会议上认为有必要表示会议是“必须考虑到其他地方的经验”的。约翰逊就是这样在执行着“守住阵地”的使命。
    然而，美国方面阻挠会议进展的活动决不止于此。西方报纸盛传，美国正在幕后加紧压迫法国政府不得接受对双方都有利的光荣解决。路透社透露，其他西方国家原已准备同意苏联代表团关于举行限制性更大的会议以讨论停战监察问题的建议，但是在美国代表团的压力下，他们又决定“暂时”不接受这个建议。
    美国借以阻挠会议达成协议的一个主要工具是保大集团。“法兰西晚报”记者在六月二十九日的一篇通讯里说，保大代表“毫不掩饰”他们将拒绝接受会议可能达成的协议。这个记者接着写道：“但是当你问他们，你们准备怎样办呢？自己单独进行战争吗？他们就表示希望，那个似乎在这方面曾鼓励他们的美国将给予他们武器和指示，以便迅速组成一支能够征服越盟的军队。”这个记者最后说：
  “似乎很可能，如果他们拒绝接受协议条款像他们威胁的那样，他们将得到另一个盟国代表团即美国代表团的支持。”
    在美国的鼓励之下，保大政府对日内瓦会议决定举行的双方直接会谈公然进行破坏。正当双方在当地的会谈即将开始的时候，新任保大总理吴庭艳竟叫嚣他将在北越设立“永久作战内阁”，以便制造不利于谈判的气氛。
    问题再也明显不过了，各国代表团在此期间能否完成他们的任务，能否给外长们回来时提供达成全部协议的必要条件，在于粉碎美国公开或暗中设下的人为障碍。作为当事一方的法国政府，只要它坚决摆脱美国压力，是会对会议的进展起重要作用的。
