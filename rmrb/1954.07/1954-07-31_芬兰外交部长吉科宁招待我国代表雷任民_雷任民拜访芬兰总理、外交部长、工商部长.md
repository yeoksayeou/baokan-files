Xinhua News Agency, Helsinki, 30th — Finnish Republic Foreign Minister Kekkonen hosted a banquet at 8 PM on July 28th for Lei Renmin, representative of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China and Vice Minister of Foreign Trade, who is visiting Finland.

Those attending the banquet included Finnish Republic Prime Minister Tuomioja, Defense Minister Skog, Minister of Commerce and Industry Tervo, Minister of Education Virolainen, Finnish Ambassador to China Sundström, other government officials, Chairman of the Finland-China Society Enckell, and figures from the business community.

Also invited to attend the banquet were Chen Ming, Deputy Director of the Third Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Trade of China, and Zou Siyi, Commissioner of the Third Bureau, Yao Dengshan, Charge d'Affaires ad interim of the Chinese Embassy in Finland, and Zhang Yunxiao, Commercial Counselor.

In his speech at the banquet, Kekkonen, on behalf of the Finnish government, welcomed Vice Minister Lei Renmin to Finland. He said that this visit "is a manifestation of the flourishing trade relations between Finland and the People's Republic of China that began less than two years ago." Subsequently, Kekkonen elaborated on the constantly growing Sino-Finnish trade relations over the past two years, and he also stated: "I believe that the continued expansion of trade is beneficial to both of our countries. Large-scale trade is, on the one hand, a manifestation of the friendly relations between our two countries, and at the same time, it is a condition for strengthening these friendly relations and expanding cultural relations." Finally, Kekkonen said: "I believe that your visit to Finland will have an impact on strengthening mutual understanding between the people of our two countries and developing trade between the two countries."

Lei Renmin expressed his gratitude in his reply, saying: "Although China and Finland are far apart, the friendship between the people of our two countries is profound and growing. In particular, the triangular trade agreement between China, Finland, and the Soviet Union, signed in 1952 with the participation of our common neighbor, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, has created a good start for Sino-Finnish trade relations. Thanks to the joint efforts of both sides, we have already created a new record in the history of Sino-Finnish trade in 1953. The total amount of Sino-Finnish trade in 1953 exceeded more than ten times the highest level of Sino-Finnish trade before the founding of the People's Republic of China—1946. The 1954 Sino-Finnish trade agreement, signed not long ago—June 21—has an increase in trade volume compared to 1953. I firmly believe that in order to meet the needs of improving the lives of the people of both countries and meeting the needs of the economic construction and development of both countries , the trade and economic relations between China and Finland will be further developed, and the friendship and cultural ties between China and Finland will become increasingly closer.

I hope that this visit will contribute to strengthening mutual understanding between the governments and people of our two countries and strengthening our economic and cultural relations."

The banquet proceeded in a friendly and harmonious atmosphere.

    雷任民致答词表示感谢，并说：“中芬两国虽然相距遥远，可是我们两国人民的友谊是深厚并且是日益增长的，特别是一九五二年在我们共同的邻邦苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟参与之下签订了中芬苏的三角贸易协定，为中芬贸易关系创立了一个良好的开端。由于我们双方的共同努力，一九五三年我们已在中芬贸易历史上创造了一个新的纪录，一九五三年的中芬贸易总额超过了中华人民共和国成立以前中芬贸易最高的一年——一九四六年的水平十倍以上。在不久以前——六月二十一日——签字的一九五四年的中芬贸易协定较一九五三年的贸易金额又有增加。我深信为满足两国人民生活提高的需要和满足两国经济建设发展的需要，中芬两国的贸易经济关系将进一步的发展，中芬两国的友谊和文化关系也将日益紧密。
