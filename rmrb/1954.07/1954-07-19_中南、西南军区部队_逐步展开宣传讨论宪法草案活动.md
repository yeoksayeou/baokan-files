Troops in the Central South and Southwest Military Regions
Gradually Launch Activities to Publicize and Discuss the Draft Constitution

The various organs, troops, and schools of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Central South Military Region and the Fourth Field Army are extensively and enthusiastically publicizing and discussing the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China. Troops in the Southwest Military Region have also gradually launched activities to publicize and discuss the Draft Constitution.

The Fourth Field Army began its publicity and discussion of the Draft Constitution at the beginning of July. All organs, troops, and schools in the army held report meetings on the Draft Constitution, and leaders at all levels personally delivered reports to their subordinate troops. As the discussion unfolded, the publicity activities of various departments became more active. All wired broadcasting stations in the army focused on broadcasting content related to the Draft Constitution. The "Soldier's Daily" devoted considerable space in each issue to publishing "Talks on the Draft Constitution" and articles written by meritorious models. More than ten types of slides drawn by the Cultural Section of the Political Department directly under the Central South Military Region are being continuously shown to commanders and fighters stationed in Guangzhou. A certain unit stationed on the Leizhou Peninsula also mobilized commanders and fighters to write letters to family members and relatives to promote the Draft Constitution. The Jiangxi Military Region held a forum on the Draft Constitution for heroes and models, with participants from various positions, including commanders, soldiers, cooks, doctors, nurses, convalescents, car drivers, office cadres, cultural instructors, students, and veteran cadres from the Red Army era. During the initial discussion of the Draft Constitution, commanders and fighters unanimously expressed their support for the Draft Constitution and their determination to greet the birth of the first people's constitution of the motherland with practical actions to defend the motherland. Sun Dianchen, the deputy company commander of a certain model company stationed on the border, a combat hero who had been awarded seven major merits, said: "The results of the Chinese people's arduous struggle for more than a hundred years and the common aspirations of the people are all written in the Draft Constitution. The Draft Constitution was bought with the blood of the Chinese people. We must fulfill our glorious duty, heighten our vigilance, and do our best to defend the achievements of the people's revolution and national construction, and safeguard the security of the country and the integrity of its territorial sovereignty." These days, he patrols until one or two o'clock in the morning before returning to sleep, and his high sense of responsibility makes him forget his personal fatigue.

The activities of the Southwest Military Region troops to publicize and discuss the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China have also gradually unfolded. Senior cadres of the Xikang Military Region heard a report on the Draft Constitution on June 19. The organs directly under the Sichuan Military Region have organized report meetings on the Draft Constitution for cadres above the platoon level. Some companies have already conducted discussions, and scattered troops will be conveyed the information by leading cadres separately. The headquarters and political department of the Southwest Military Region and other units have conveyed the report on the Draft Constitution made by Deputy Commander Li Da to their subordinate cadres. All soldiers of the superior units have also heard the report. Units have decided to provide make-up sessions for comrades who did not hear the report due to being on duty, so as to achieve universal depth and ensure that everyone knows. All units are using broadcasts and blackboards to cooperate with the publicity. The artillery troops of the Southwest Military Region have arranged discussion times to organize troops to discuss. The troops convened a cadre meeting on June 21 and delivered a report on the Draft Constitution.

    中南、西南军区部队
    逐步展开宣传讨论宪法草案活动
    中国人民解放军中南军区、第四野战军所属陆、海、空军各机关、部队、学校等单位，正广泛、热烈地宣传、讨论中华人民共和国宪法草案。西南军区部队也已逐步展开宣传、讨论宪法草案的活动。
      第四野战军全军从七月初就展开了宪法草案的宣传讨论。全军各机关、部队、学校都分别举行了宪法草案报告会，各级首长都亲自向所属部队分别作了报告。随着讨论的展开，各部的宣传活动更加活跃。全军所有有线广播站都以播讲宪法草案为中心内容。“战士报”每期以大量篇幅，刊载“宪法草案讲话”和功臣模范们写的文章。中南军区直属政治部文化科绘制的十余种幻灯片，正向驻广州市机关、部队指战员连续放映。驻守在雷州半岛的某部，还发动指战员向家属、亲友等写信宣传宪法草案。江西军区举行了有指挥员、战士、炊事员、医生、护士、休养员、汽车驾驶员、机关干部、文化教员、学员和红军时代的老干部等各个不同岗位上的模范人物参加的英雄模范宪法草案座谈会。在进行宪法草案的初步讨论中，指战员一致表示拥护宪法草案，并要以保卫祖国的实际行动来迎接祖国第一个人民的宪法的诞生。驻守在边防上的某模范连队副连长、曾立七大功的战斗英雄孙殿臣说：“一百多年中国人民艰苦奋斗的成果和人民的共同愿望，都写在宪法草案上面了。宪法草案是中国人民用血换来的。我们一定要尽自己的光荣义务，提高警惕性，用尽全力保卫人民革命和国家建设的成果，保卫国家的安全和领土主权的完整。”这些天来，他每晚查哨到深夜一两点钟才回来睡觉，高度的责任感使他忘记了个人的疲劳。
    西南军区部队宣传、讨论中华人民共和国宪法草案的活动也已逐步展开。西康军区的高级干部在六月十九日听了有关宪法草案的报告。四川军区直属机关已组织了排以上干部的宪法草案报告会。有的连队已进行了讨论，分散的部队将由领导干部分别前往传达。西南军区司令部、政治部等单位，按照李达副司令员所作宪法草案的报告，向所属干部进行了传达。上属单位的全体战士也已听了报告，因值勤未听到报告的同志，各单位都决定进行补课，以达到普遍深入，人人皆知。各单位都利用广播、黑板报等配合进行宣传。西南军区炮兵部队已安排了讨论时间，组织部队讨论。该部队已于六月二十
  一日召开了干部会，作了宪法草案的报告。
