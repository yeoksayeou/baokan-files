International Opinion Welcomes the Joint Declaration of Chinese and Indian, and Chinese and Burmese Premiers
Unanimous Agreement that Peace Forces are Greatly Encouraged
Myanmar

The Burmese public warmly welcomed the joint declaration of the Premiers of China and Myanmar, believing that this statement is of great significance for the development of friendship between China and Myanmar and for peace in Asia and the world.

The "Burma New Times" commented on the great significance of the results of the talks between the Premiers of China, Myanmar, and India, saying: "The foundation of a new Asia has been laid," and "With sincerity in all aspects and the implementation of the Five Principles established in Delhi and Yangon, Asia may be built into an Asia that is no longer manipulated by the West." The commentary also criticized the United States for trying its best to undermine and threaten the unity of Asian countries.

The "Burma New Light" believes that the joint declaration of the Premiers of China and Myanmar and the joint declaration of the Premiers of China and India are "as important as a treaty signed between the two countries." The successive announcements of these two joint declarations have made people all over the world, except for that small group of people who are hostile to the Chinese People's regime, feel happy. The joint declarations of the Premiers of China, India, and Myanmar are helpful in strengthening friendly relations.

The "Yangon Daily" pointed out that if all countries can reach an understanding based on the Five Principles put forward in the joint declaration of Premier Zhou Enlai and Premier Nehru, then the whole world will surely achieve peace.

The "Mandalay Daily" commented: "The frank talks between the Premiers of China and Myanmar will not only greatly contribute to the development of diplomatic relations between China and Myanmar, but also to peace in Asia and the world. The joint declaration announced on June 29 has proved the success of the talks between the two Premiers, which makes us feel infinitely excited."

The commentary wrote: The joint declaration of the Premiers of China and Myanmar "has reached agreement on the Five Principles, and there is no doubt that the people of the whole world who demand mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, national self-determination, non-aggression, and demand peace will welcome this joint declaration with infinite joy and excitement."

The commentary quoted the statement of the Premiers of China and Myanmar that they will do their utmost to promote world peace, especially in Southeast Asia, and hope that the issue of restoring peace in Indochina, which is being discussed in Geneva, will be satisfactorily resolved, and said: "The complexity of the Indochina issue is threatening world peace. If this issue is not resolved, peace in Southeast Asia cannot be maintained. Therefore, the two countries neighboring Indochina must do their utmost to promote the realization of peace in Indochina. The agreement of the two Premiers to work towards this goal will infinitely encourage the people of Asia."

The commentary pointed out: "If all countries in the world can accept the principle agreed upon by the Premiers of China and Myanmar that 'all peoples should have the right to choose their national system and way of life without interference from other countries,' there will be no acts of aggression; if all countries can abide by this principle, all countries in the world can coexist peacefully."

Australia

The "Daily Telegraph" in Sydney, Australia, published a report by its correspondent in New Delhi on the talks between the Premiers of China and India. The report said: Many Indians believe that this meeting marks a turning point in Asian history, the first time since Western countries invaded Asia three centuries ago that Asian countries have tried to decide the fate of Asia without European interference and influence.

Lebanon and Kenya

Middle Eastern and African newspapers believe that the talks between Premier Zhou Enlai and Premier Nehru play an important role in promoting peace in Asia.

Lebanon's "Al-Hayat" said that the talks between the Premiers of China and India have had a positive impact on Asian issues.

The "Kenya Daily Mail" in Mombasa, Africa, said that the meeting was of historical significance. The newspaper also said that Asian countries have determined to completely eliminate Western forces and rule from Asia, and not to allow Western countries to turn Asia into a battlefield under any pretext.

France

French newspapers commented on the talks between Premier Zhou Enlai and Premier Nehru, believing that this meeting is of great significance.

"L'Humanité" wrote: "We have seen in Delhi that the representatives of India and China have proved that two countries with completely different social systems and political systems can establish friendship if they are linked by the desire to strive for peace and independence." The newspaper also said: "June 25, 1954 (the day Premier Zhou Enlai arrived in New Delhi) was the day when the policy of peaceful coexistence won a great victory over the policy of crusades."

"Le Monde" said that Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to the Indian capital "guaranteed the friendship between the two major Asian countries."

"Le Peuple" commented: "Asian diplomacy seems to have taken a step forward," "Asian countries have proved that they do not want some of the issues that are most relevant to them to be decided without their direct participation." (Xinhua News Agency)

    各国舆论欢迎中印、中缅总理的联合声明
    一致认为和平力量受到很大鼓舞
    缅甸
    缅甸舆论热烈欢迎中缅两国总理联合声明，认为这个声明对发展中缅两国的友谊和对亚洲与世界和平都有重大的意义。
    “缅甸新时代报”评论中缅、中印总理会谈的结果的重大意义说：“一个新亚洲的基础已经奠定了”，“随着各方面的诚意和在德里、仰光确定下来的五大原则的实行，亚洲就可能建设成为一个不再是被西方所玩弄的亚洲了”。评论并指责美国又在尽力进行破坏和威胁亚洲国家的团结。
    “缅甸新光报”认为，中缅两国总理联合声明和中印两国总理联合声明“其性质如同两国签订的条约那样重要”。这两个联合声明的相继公布，除了那一小撮敌视中国人民政权的人们外，全世界人民都感到欢欣。中印、中缅总理的联合声明有助于友好关系的加强。
    “仰光日报”指出，如果各国能够根据周恩来总理和尼赫鲁总理的联合声明中提出的五项原则达成谅解，那么全世界一定会得到和平。
    “曼岱日报”的评论说：“中缅两国总理的坦白会谈，不仅对发展中缅两国邦交，而且对亚洲和世界和平都将有很大的贡献。六月二十九日公布的联合声明已证明了两国总理会谈的成功，这使我们感到无限的兴奋”。
    评论写道：中缅两国总理联合声明“在五项原则上获得了同意，毫无疑问的，要求彼此尊重领土主权，民族自决，互不侵犯以及要求和平的全世界人民对这一联合声明，一定会以无限的喜悦和兴奋的心情表示欢迎”。
    评论引述中缅两国总理声明他们将竭力促进全世界的、特别是东南亚的和平，并希望正在日内瓦讨论的恢复印度支那和平的问题将得到满意的解决的话后说：“印度支那问题的复杂性正威胁着世界和平。这个问题不能获得解决，东南亚的和平就无法保持。因此，与印度支那邻近的两国必须竭力促进印度支那和平实现。两国总理同意为这一目标而努力，这将使亚洲人民感到无限的鼓舞。”
    评论指出：“如果世界各国都能接受中缅两国总理所同意的‘各国人民都应该有选择他们的国家制度和生活方式的权利，不应受到其他国家的干涉’这一原则，就不会有侵略的事件发生；如果各国都能遵守这一原则，世界各国就能和平共处下去。”
    澳大利亚
    澳大利亚悉尼的“每日电讯报”登载了它驻新德里记者的一篇关于中印两国总理会谈的报道。报道说：许多印度人认为这次会谈标志着亚洲历史的一个转折点，这是自三世纪以前西方国家侵入亚洲以来，亚洲国家第一次试图在不受欧洲的干涉和影响的情况下来决定亚洲的命运。
    黎巴嫩和怯尼亚
    中东和非洲的报纸认为，周恩来总理和尼赫鲁总理的会谈对促进亚洲和平起着重要的作用。
    黎巴嫩“生活报”说，中印两国总理这次会谈，对亚洲问题产生了有利的影响。
    非洲蒙巴萨的“怯尼亚每日邮报”说，这次会谈具有历史意义。报纸又说，亚洲国家已下决心务必要把西方的势力和统治从亚洲完全清除出去，并且不让西方国家在任何借口下把亚洲变做战场。
    法国
    法国报纸在评论周恩来总理和尼赫鲁总理的会谈时，认为这一会谈有重大的意义。
    “人道报”写道：“我们在德里已经看到，印度和中国的代表证明了，两个社会制度和政体完全不同的国家如果以争取和平和独立的愿望联系起来的话，是可以建立友谊的。”报纸并说：“一九五四年六月二十五日（按即周恩来总理到达新德里的日子）是和平共处政策战胜十字军征伐政策而取得伟大胜利的日子。”
    “世界报”说，周恩来总理访问印度首都，“保证了亚洲两大国之间的友谊”。
      “人民报”评论说：“亚洲的外交政策看来已经前进了一步”，“亚洲国家已证明，它们并不想让一些与它们最有关系的问题在没有它们直接参加的情况下被决定。”（据新华社讯）
