Hunan Province Hongjiang Forestry Bureau

Successfully Trials New Type of Timber Raft

The Hongjiang Branch of the Hunan Provincial Forestry Bureau adopted the suggestions of raft workers such as Wu Chao-yu and successfully trialed a new type of timber raft.

In March, when leading cadres from the Hongjiang Branch were inspecting work in Tongdao, Jingxian, and other places, they discovered that the transportation volume of small rivers was higher than that of large rivers. For example, in Jingxian, Huitong, and other places, each person could float 25 cubic meters of timber rafts to Hongjiang, and Guangping could float 30 cubic meters, but from Hongjiang to Zou Shi, each person could only float 20 cubic meters. After returning to Hongjiang, they gathered some raft workers to study the matter, and everyone offered many opinions on the construction of timber rafts. Wu Chao-yu first proposed increasing the timber volume of three-section rafts and reducing the number of people needed for floating. Zhai Zefang, Yang Changsheng, Wang Liankao, and others proposed six forms such as arrowhead rafts, boat-shaped rafts, and "品 (pin)"-shaped rafts. The leadership adopted these suggestions, broke with convention, changed the previous method of making the head and tail the same size, and conducted trial floats. After floating, through twelve days of hard work, they successfully completed the 800-li journey and transported the timber to Zou Shi. As a result, an average of five workers could be saved per connection. Based on the Hongjiang timber collection yard releasing 300 connected rafts per month, 1,500 labor forces can be saved per month, and more than 600 million yuan in funds can be saved. The floating efficiency is one to three times higher than in the past. The Hongjiang Branch is currently synthesizing the advantages of these new types of rafts in order to promote them comprehensively in the local area.

    湖南省洪江森林工业分局
    试放新形木排成功
    湖南省森林工业局洪江分局采纳排筏工人吴朝玉等人的建议，试放新形木排获得成功。
    三月间，洪江分局的领导干部在通道、靖县等地检查工作时，发现小河运输量比大河还高，如靖县、会同等地放洪江的木排，每人能放二十五个立方公尺，广平能放到三十个立方公尺，但洪江到陬市，每人只放二十个立方公尺。他们回洪江后，便约集一些排筏工人进行研究，大家对木排的编扎提出了很多意见。吴朝玉首先提出在三节木排上增加木排材积、减少放运人数，翟择芳、杨长生、王连考等人又提出箭头排、船形排、品字排等六种形式，领导上采纳了这些意见，打破陈规，改变了过去头尾一样大的编排方法，进行试放。放运后，经过十二天的努力，胜利完成八百里运程将木材运达陬市，结果每联平均要节省五名人工。按洪江集材场每月放出木排三百联计算，每月即可节省一千五百个劳动力，并节省资金六亿多元，放运效率比过去提高一倍到三倍。洪江分局目前正在综合这些新形排的优点，以便在当地全面推广。
