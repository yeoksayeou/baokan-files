Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 16th, TASS reported: "Pravda" special correspondents in Geneva, Zhukov and Prishevsky, published an article in "Pravda" entitled: "U.S. New Attempts to Obstruct the Restoration of Peace in Indochina." Zhukov and Prishevsky wrote that Dulles, amidst a sensational uproar, suddenly flew to Paris for separate talks with Eden and Mendès-France, forcing the latter two to temporarily interrupt their work at the Geneva Conference to attend these talks, which clearly had the purpose of diverting people's attention. The issue is that during the foreign ministers' meeting, it had become evident that a peaceful solution to the Indochina issue was possible, and some positive results had already been achieved.
    This caused panic in Washington, which had originally expected its obstructionist tactics to prevent the Geneva negotiations from reaching a successful conclusion. As the French newspaper "Le Figaro" stated on July 13th, reaching an agreement in Geneva would prove to the world: "The United States is hindering the agreement when it is there, and it is only possible to reach an agreement on the Indochina issue when the United States is not there."
    Zhukov and Prishevsky pointed out that Dulles in Paris repeatedly tried to undermine the achievements made so far at the Geneva Conference, forcing France and Britain to pursue the "old plan" of turning at least part, if not all, of Indochina into a bridgehead for new gambles in Asia.
    Zhukov and Prishevsky pointed out that U.S. foreign policy clearly aims to replace the universal guarantees regarding the supervision of peace in Indochina, which until recently were still being debated, with a separate "guarantee" by Western countries that could easily turn part of Indochina into a base for aggression.
    The U.S.'s consistent diplomatic policy of attempting to obstruct free elections in Indochina proves this point. Free elections are the only way to ultimately eliminate the inevitable temporary division caused by the demarcation of assembly areas for the armed forces of the warring parties and restore the country's unity.
    The United States is doing everything in its power to split Indochina and trying to include even a part of Indochina in the aggressive bloc it is building in Asia. Therefore, it wants to delay these elections indefinitely by any means and, if possible, not even mention the issue. U.S. newspapers openly "explain" that the United States can never agree to hold elections because...the voting results will certainly favor the supporters of the Ho Chi Minh government.
    Until recently, the French government insisted on holding elections in Indochina within a certain period stipulated in the armistice terms.
    However, after Mendès-France returned to Geneva, the Agence France-Presse correspondent in Geneva issued a telegram of a completely different nature. Some of his words contradicted the attitude that the French delegation had taken so far and instead conformed to the propositions of U.S. foreign policy.
    It is not difficult to see the purpose of raising the issue of elections in this way.
    They are only interested in dividing Indochina in the Korean manner under the pretext of drawing a temporary demarcation line, in order to turn the southern part of the country into a part of the military aggression system that the United States has stubbornly been trying to piece together in Asia.
    Zhukov and Prishevsky concluded that these specific facts clearly show that U.S. foreign policy is now doing everything in its power to obstruct the achievement of an agreement to restore peace in Indochina and is correspondingly exerting pressure on France and Britain. The developments in the next few days will show how things unfold. In any case, given the progress already made, the Geneva Conference is likely to produce concrete results. That is why the representatives of U.S. aggressors are in a state of panic; they are afraid of achieving peace and easing international tensions.

    美国阻挠恢复印度支那和平的新企图
    ——“真理报”驻日内瓦记者的文章的摘要
    【新华社十六日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十六日讯：“真理报”驻日内瓦特派记者茹科夫和普利歇夫斯基在“真理报”上发表了一篇文章，题目是：“美国阻挠恢复印度支那和平的新企图”。茹科夫和普利歇夫斯基写道，杜勒斯在一阵耸人听闻的吵吵嚷嚷声中，突然飞到巴黎跟艾登和孟戴斯—弗朗斯举行单独会谈，而使后面两个人不得不暂时中断日内瓦会议的工作，来参加这次会谈，显然是具有一种转移人们注意力的目的的。问题是：在外长会议的过程中，很明显地已经有可能得到印度支那问题的和平解决办法，而且已经得到了某种肯定的结果。
    这一点引起了华盛顿方面的惊慌，他们原来期望他们的阻挠策略会阻止日内瓦谈判获得成功的结束。正如法国报纸“费加罗报”七月十三日所说的，在日内瓦达成协议，将会向全世界证明：“美国在那里，妨碍达成协议，而美国不在那里，反而使得就印度支那问题达成协议成为可能。”
    茹科夫和普利歇夫斯基指出，杜勒斯在巴黎一再地想破坏日内瓦会议迄今所获得的成就，迫使法国和英国奉行那种“老计划”，就是即使不是把印度支那的全部而至少是要把印度支那的一部分变成一个桥头堡在亚洲进行新的赌博的“老计划”。
    茹科夫和普利歇夫斯基指出，美国的外交政策显然是想以一种容易把一部分印度支那变成侵略基地的西方国家的单独“保证”，来代替直到最近还有问题的关于监察印度支那和平的普遍保证。
    美国一贯地力图阻挠印度支那举行自由选举的外交政策，正说明了这一点，而举行自由选举是能够最后消除由于划分交战双方武装部队的集结地区而造成的不可避免的暂时的分割并恢复这个国家的统一的。
    美国正在尽其一切力量试图分裂印度支那，并且力图把即使是印度支那的一部分地区包括在它正在亚洲建立的侵略集团之内，因此，它想尽一切方法使这种选举无限期地拖延下去，并且如果可能的话，根本就不提这个问题。美国报纸毫不隐讳地“解释”说，美国绝不能同意举行选举，因为……投票结果肯定是胡志明政府的支持者们获得胜利。
    直到最近，法国政府才主张在停战条款规定的一定时间内在印度支那举行选举。
    但是在孟戴斯—弗朗斯回到日内瓦之后，在日内瓦的法新社记者发出了一则性质全然不同的电讯。他说的一些话和法国代表团迄今采取的态度背道而驰，反而符合于美国外交政策的主张。
    不难看出用这种方式提出选举问题的目的何在。
    他们感到兴趣的只是在划分一条临时分界线的借口下按朝鲜方式分割印度支那，以便把这个国家的南部变为美国迄今顽固地试图在亚洲拼凑的军事侵略体系的一部分。
    茹科夫和普利歇夫斯基最后说，这些具体事实清楚地说明，美国的外交政策现在是尽一切力量阻挠达成恢复印度支那和平的协议，并相应地对法国和英国施加压力。今后几天将可看出事情的发展。无论如何，现时由于已取得的工作成就，日内瓦会议很可能产生具体的结果。就是因为这样，美国侵略分子的代表们才惊慌失措，他们是害怕实现和平和缓和国际紧张局势的。
