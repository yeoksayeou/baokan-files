The Birth of the First Giant Grain Stacking Machine
    Chai Yi

    Twelve years ago, one day at noon, stevedores were carrying grain into a warehouse. A thirteen-year-old boy suddenly fell from a seesaw more than two zhang high, along with a heavy sack of grain, injuring his leg and foot and passing out. His mother stroked the boy's wounds, weeping, and said, "Child, if there were even a grain of rice at home, your mother would never let you go sell your life." But to feed the whole family, twenty days later, he returned to the stevedore team. This boy was Han Jinsheng. At the age of sixteen, he vomited blood from carrying grain sacks weighing more than four hundred jin. At that time, he thought, "If a machine could be created so that workers no longer have to carry two or three hundred jin of grain, climbing high and crossing bridges, that would be great!" But before liberation, his ideal was never realized.

    In July 1952, Han Jinsheng was selected as a representative of the stevedores to attend the邯郸镇(Handan Town) People's Representative Conference. At the meeting, the Deputy Mayor said, "As the working class, the masters of the country, should use their brains, find clever ways, create wealth for the country, and let machines replace heavy physical labor." Han Jinsheng heard the report, and his past ideals came alive in his mind. After the meeting, he and stevedore Wang Qingfu discussed creating a grain stacking machine.

    Once, Han Jinsheng and the workers were moving wheat at a flour mill. He saw the elevator flexibly and powerfully transporting wheat to the second floor, and he thought, "If we make a grain stacking machine according to the principle of this machine, wouldn't it be possible to get the grain into the high stockpiles!" After work, he and Wang Qingfu and others began to figure it out: the elevator is fixed, it cannot move. If the grain stacking machine is also made to be fixed, then one warehouse would need to install one grain stacking machine, which would be too wasteful. Later, he thought of the artillery in the army, with a base and wheels to drive the gun body. He thought: if the elevator is also equipped with wheels, can't it move back and forth! The next day, he explained his idea to worker Wang Qingfu, and the two drew a picture based on the appearance of the elevator. The picture was very simple, without dimensions or detailed structure, just a large cylinder standing on top, with a base and four wheels at the bottom. Then they bought white cloth and cardboard, and made a model out of scrap wood.

    After having the model, it was impossible to start trial production because no unit could be found to be responsible for the expenses. He thought: "I am a Communist Party member, can I let difficulties stop me?" He went to the CPC邯郸(Handan) Municipal Committee and asked for help in finding someone to solve the technical problems such as drawing. The municipal leaders encouraged his spirit of creation and overcoming difficulties, and soon invited technician Li Chungeng to draw the first more detailed blueprint for him.

    In September 1952, Han Jinsheng took the blueprint to 保定(Baoding) and received the help of the Heavy Industry Department of the Hebei Provincial Department of Industry. An engineer from the Heavy Industry Department conducted a meticulous and responsible study based on the drawings and his report, and affirmed that this creation was in accordance with machine principles, but there were two shortcomings: one was that the body was too high (8.4 meters), which would cause the machine to shake when running, which was not safe; the other was that the circulating lifting cylinder should be changed from one to two to improve transportation efficiency. Han Jinsheng returned to 邯郸(Handan) with these valuable opinions, and asked technician Li Chungeng to draw the second blueprint based on these opinions. After review by the leaders of the Provincial Finance and Economics Committee and other leading organs, it was approved that the 邯郸(Handan) Prefectural Grain Bureau should spend one million yuan to conduct trial production.

    With the help of technicians Xu Fuhai and Li Chungeng, Han Jinsheng made a second model in December 1952, which was basically successful after testing.

    In March 1953, after the Hebei Provincial People's Government Department of Transportation heard about Han Jinsheng's creation of a grain stacking machine, it sent people to assist Han Jinsheng to the Central People's Government Department of Transportation and the Ministry of Grain. The Central People's Government Department of Transportation and the Ministry of Grain conducted repeated research on the structure of the second model and put forward many suggestions for improvement. Soviet experts also put forward several opinions, such as the power being too small and the lifting speed being too high, to further scientize the grain stacking machine. After research by the chief engineer of the Transportation Bureau of the Central People's Government Department of Transportation, it was agreed to try to manufacture one.

    In March 1954, the "Grain Stacking Machine Trial Production Group" was formed by the state-owned Hebei Provincial Transportation Company, the Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, and the Provincial Grain Department, and it was decided to manufacture it in 邯郸(Handan). After a month of efforts by the workers of the 邯郸(Handan) Agricultural Implement Manufacturing Factory, it was officially installed before International Labor Day on May 1st.

    第一台巨型捣囤机的诞生
    柴毅
    十二年前的一天中午，装卸工人们正向仓库里搬运粮食，一个十三岁的孩子忽然从两丈多高的翘板上和笨重的粮袋一块摔下来，腿和脚都摔伤，晕了过去。母亲抚摸着孩子的伤痕，流着泪说：“孩子，家里要是有一粒米，娘说啥也不叫你去卖命。”可是为了全家人吃饭，二十天以后，他又回到装卸队去。这个孩子就是韩金生。在十六岁那年，他又因抬四百多斤重的粮袋累得吐过血。当时他想：“要能创造出一架机器来，工人们再不用扛着二、三百斤重的粮食爬高过桥了，那该多好！”可是在解放前，他的理想总未实现。
    一九五二年七月，韩金生被选为装卸工人代表，出席了邯郸镇各界人民代表会议。会上，副镇长说：“作为国家主人翁的工人阶级，应当开动脑筋，找窍门，给国家创造财富，让机器代替笨重的体力劳动。”韩金生听了报告，过去的理想又活现在脑子里。会后，他就和装卸工人王清福商量要创造捣囤机。
    一次，韩金生和工人们在面粉厂搬运小麦，他看到升降机灵活有力地把小麦输送到二层楼房上去，心里就想：“按这个机器的道理做一台捣囤机，不是可以把粮食弄到高囤里去吗！”下班后，他就和王清福等琢磨起来：升降机是死的，不能动，如果把捣囤机也弄成死的，就得一个仓库安一个捣囤机，那太浪费。后来他想起军队中的大炮，有底座、有轱轳能带动炮身，他想：如果把升降机也安上轱轳，不就能来回走动了吗！第二天，他找工人王清福说明了自己的想法，两个人就照着升降机的样子画了一个图。图很简单，既没有尺寸，也没有详细的构造，只是上面竖着一个大筒子，下边是底座和四个轱轳。接着就买白布和硬纸，用碎木片做起模型来。
    有了模型以后，但因找不到负责开支的单位，无法试制。他想：“我是共产党员，还能让困难挡住？”他找到中共邯郸市委，要求帮助找人解决绘图等技术上的问题。市委领导上鼓励了他这种创造和克服困难的精神，很快请李春耕技师，给他绘出了第一张比较详细的蓝图。
    一九五二年九月里，韩金生带着蓝图到了保定，得到了河北省工业厅重工业处的帮助。重工业处的一位工程师，根据图样和他的报告进行了细致的、负责的研究，肯定这个创造合乎机器原理，但有两个缺点：一个是机身太高（八点四公尺），运转起来会发生上晃现象，不够安全；另一个是循环升降筒应该由一个改为两个，提高运输效率。韩金生带着这些宝贵的意见回到邯郸，请李春耕技师根据这些意见绘了第二张蓝图。后经过省财经委员会等领导机关审核，批准由邯郸专署粮食局支出一百万元进行试制。
    韩金生在技师徐福海、李春耕的帮助下，到一九五二年十二月间制成了第二个模型，经试验基本成功。
    一九五三年三月，河北省人民政府交通厅听到韩金生创造捣囤机的事情以后，便派人协同韩金生到中央人民政府交通部和粮食部。中央人民政府交通部和粮食部根据第二个模型的构造，进行了反复的研究，提出了许多改进意见。苏联专家也提出了几点意见，如动力太小，升运速度过高等，使捣囤机进一步科学化。经中央人民政府交通部运输局总工程师研究，同意试制一台。
    一九五四年三月，由国营河北省运输公司、省工会联合会、省府粮食厅等单位组成了“试制捣囤机小组”，确定在邯郸制造。经过邯郸农具制造厂工人们一个月的努力，在“五一”国际劳动节前夕正式安装起来。
