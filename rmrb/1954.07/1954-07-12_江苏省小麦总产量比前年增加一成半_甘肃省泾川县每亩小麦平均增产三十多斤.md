Jiangsu Province has completed the harvest of over 30 million mu of wheat, with a total output of approximately 3.8 billion jin, an increase of 15% compared to 1952, the year with the highest yield after liberation.

Since May, continuous rainfall and waterlogging in low-lying areas have generally delayed the summer harvest and planting, making various farm tasks crowded and exceptionally tense. Under the correct leadership of the local Party and government, farmers in various regions have waged a tenacious struggle against the difficulties. Farmers in the Huaiyin area generally went to the fields to harvest immediately after the rain. In Taicang County, 42 agricultural production cooperatives and more than 5,600 mutual aid teams led farmers throughout the county to harvest and plant early and late. In Suqian County, 20,000 farmers in the Xiaodian, Taishan, and Lailong districts helped farmers in the Luoma Lake area to complete the harvest of 300,000 mu of wheat in seven days before the flood season. During the summer harvest, the state provided farmers with tremendous assistance. The newly built animal-drawn farm implement stations and tractor tillage stations harvested wheat for many mutual aid and cooperative organizations. 165 water pumps at eleven pumping stations in various regions helped farmers drain water, save wheat, and protect seedlings. In order to help farmers solve the difficulties of plowing cattle and farm implements, the People's Bank of China in various regions issued agricultural loans of approximately 95 billion yuan.

During this year's summer harvest and planting, the quality of cultivation has improved in various regions. Many places have launched a campaign of "not wasting a single grain of grain, not losing a single blade of grass," achieving light harvesting and threshing, while simultaneously harvesting, threshing, and drying.

The summer harvest in Jingchuan County, Gansu Province, has been completed. This year, wheat in all areas of the county, whether in mountainous areas or on plains, has achieved a bumper harvest. The average yield per mu is approximately 130 jin, an increase of more than 30 jin compared to 97 jin per mu last year, exceeding the original planned average yield of 120 jin per mu by 8.3%. According to preliminary statistics, large areas with yields of 172 jin to 400 jin per mu account for 20% of the total sown area of 580,000 mu of wheat in the county. More than 80% of these large areas of high yield are managed by organized farmers.

In order to complete the summer harvest work in a timely manner, the Jingchuan County Committee of the Communist Party of China and the County People's Government organized representatives to focus on discussing the preparation and arrangement of the summer harvest at the mutual aid and cooperation representative meeting held in May. County and district-level agencies also transferred most of their cadres to the countryside to lead the summer harvest. This basically overcame the phenomenon of individual farmers grabbing crops due to the general mutual aid groups "organizing in the spring and collapsing in the summer" of previous years. Under the leadership of mutual aid and cooperation organizations, individual farmers also organized many temporary work teams. About 60% or more of the farmers in the county are organized to carry out the harvest.

    江苏省小麦总产量比前年增加一成半
    甘肃省泾川县每亩小麦平均增产三十多斤
    江苏省三千多万亩小麦已全部收割完毕，总产量可达三十八亿斤左右，比解放后产量最高的一九五二年增产一成半。
    五月份以来连续阴雨，低洼地区遭受涝害，夏收夏种普遍推迟，各种农活挤在一起，异常紧张。各地农民在当地党、政的正确领导下向困难进行了顽强的斗争。淮阴专区农民一般雨后即下田抢收。太仓县四十二个农业生产合作社和五千六百多个互助组带动全县农民起早带晚抢收抢种。宿迁县晓店、泰山、来龙等五个区两万多农民在汛期前帮助骆马湖地区农民在七天中将三十万亩麦子全部收割完毕。在夏收中，国家给农民巨大的援助。今年新建的马拉农具站和拖拉机代耕站为许多互助合作组织收割了小麦，各地十一个抽水机站的一百六十五台抽水机帮助农民排涝救麦保苗。为了帮助农民解决耕牛、农具困难，各地人民银行发放的农业贷款约达九百五十亿元。
    今年夏收夏种中，各地耕作质量都有了提高。很多地方开展了“不撒不霉一粒粮，不丢不烂一把草”的运动，做到轻收轻打，边收边打边晒。
    甘肃省泾川县夏田已收割完毕。今年，全县无论山川塬地的小麦，都获得了丰收。每亩平均约收一百三十斤，比去年每亩九十七斤，增产三十多斤；超过了今年原计划每亩平均收一百二十斤的百分之八点三。全县五十八万多亩小麦，据初步统计，每亩产一百七十二斤到四百斤的大面积丰产地就占播种总面积的百分之二十。这些大面积丰产地中，百分之八十以上是组织起来的农民所经营的。
    为了及时完成夏收工作，中共泾川县委员会和县人民政府，早在五月间召开的互助合作代表会上，即组织代表着重讨论了夏收准备工作和夏收工作的安排问题；县、区级机关并把绝大部分干部抽调下乡，领导夏收；基本上克服了往年一般互助组
  “春组织，夏垮台”各顾各的抢黄现象，单干农民在互助合作组织的带动下，也多组织了临时搭工组。全县约有百分之六十以上的农民，都组织起来进行收割。
