    Changes Brought About by Struggle
    Zhang Youji

    Struggle brings about changes. Some of these changes are written on the pages of history, while others are imprinted in people's hearts.

    After the draft constitution was published, I visited an old worker who had participated in three uprisings. From the changes he experienced, we can see an epitome of the changes in the status of our working class. He is Comrade Zhou Guoqiang, the current deputy manager of the Shanghai Hunnan Water, Electricity and Transportation Company.

    This company has been under local state ownership by the People's Government for just over half a year. It once bore the signboard of imperialism for half a century – of course, the struggle waged by the working class here has also been going on for a long time. From the day Zhou Guoqiang came here as a ticket seller, it has been almost thirty years.

    Today, in the manager's office where the telephone rings frequently, we can see Zhou Guoqiang sitting at his desk, wearing reading glasses, concentrating on official business. Sometimes, he stands up and warmly receives workers who come to talk about work. In the early morning, on the route where the company's first vehicle departs, workers can often see his stout figure in a blue uniform, talking loudly and enthusiastically with conductors or drivers. Everyone knows that these things are not surprising today, but in the past, the manager of this company – the agent of imperialism – was not someone an ordinary worker could meet.

    Zhou Guoqiang first saw the former manager in March 1927, when the Shanghai working class's third uprising was victorious. At that time, the Sanshan Guildhall in Nanshi, Shanghai, hung a banner that read "Shanghai General Labor Union Nanshi Garrison Headquarters." Eighty members of the company's garrison team participated in the uprising, and the headquarters decided to let half of them return to work first. At the workers' request, the imperialist consulate, the patrol room, and the representatives, bosses, and managers of the company had to come to the Sanshan Guildhall by car to welcome the workers they had previously ordered to be dismissed back to work. That was the first time Zhou Guoqiang saw the company's manager. They seemed much more "humble" than before. The car stopped far away, and they took off their hats early, bowing as they entered the Sanshan Guildhall, where workers armed with weapons stood guard at the door.

    What was the uprising like? Here is just an example of a team that Zhou Guoqiang participated in. At noon on March 21, the fire bell of the Nanshi Fire Brigade "Dang, Dang, Dang" announced the start of the third uprising. Zhou Guoqiang, like many workers, drove the vehicles back to the factory from the route, and people quickly gathered at the labor union. Then, a team of over a hundred people set off. But there were only three guns: one Mauser pistol, one revolver, and one "six-inch" pistol. The Mauser pistol had only eight bullets, the revolver's bullets were all loaded, and the "six-inch" pistol no longer fired. In addition, there were forty axes obtained from the fire brigade. Therefore, most people were empty-handed, or only held a rope used by the "Boy Scouts" at the time. Our Zhou Guoqiang was then jokingly called a "little devil" by his worker brothers, and he finally managed to get an axe after "arguing and fighting." "Go to the enemy to get weapons," the insurgents set off. Finally, the ropes bound Sun Chuanfang's broadsword team members, the axes split open the tightly closed doors of the reactionary agencies, and a large number of weapons were seized. They occupied the Daotai Yamen – the center of the reactionary government at the time.

    In the struggle, the comparative relationship of actual strength changed, and the company's manager – the agent of imperialism – took off his hat.

    Not long after, on April 12 of the same year, Jiang Jieshi, that great swindler, great robber, and great running dog of imperialism, who had presented the victorious working class of the three uprisings with a banner of "struggle together," betrayed the revolution. The victory that the Shanghai workers had won with their lives was stolen by Jiang Jieshi. Jiang Jieshi slaughtered the heroic workers. The revolution temporarily failed. Imperialism put on another hideous face. The forty members of the worker's garrison team who finally returned to the company to resume work after participating in the uprising were all dismissed.

    The struggle of the working class did not end because the Jiang Jieshi bandit gang colluded with imperialism to carry out slaughter and intimidation. From the Great Revolution until the eve of Shanghai's liberation, in this company, one strike after another broke out, making imperialism, traitors, and reactionaries tremble with fear. In the midst of many strikes, leaders of the workers' movement were murdered, many workers were arrested and imprisoned, and more workers were forced to do hard labor. However, the struggle was persevered, and the struggle was carried out anytime, anywhere. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the unity of the company's workers was further strengthened. On the day the workers' own union was formally established in March 1946, the company's manager had to send flower baskets on the surface and personally attend to deliver a congratulatory speech. However, the welfare demands that the workers had put forward at the end of 1945, which he had fully agreed to under the workers' strike struggle, were deliberately delayed afterwards and not fully resolved. When Zhou Guoqiang and other union leaders went to the manager's office, which had always been regarded as a "forbidden area," to negotiate with him, he deliberately put on an inviolable air: his eyes looking at the ceiling, his nose doing more talking than his mouth. The workers' representatives had a place to stand for negotiations, but no seats to sit on.

    The Jiang Jieshi bandit gang was afraid of imperialism, but the working class was not afraid of imperialism. Zhou Guoqiang once stood in the manager's office and asked directly: "Does the company acknowledge that we are representatives? Since it is a negotiation, what position are you putting us in?" That cunning and slippery agent of imperialism immediately stood up from his seat and said: "I'm sorry, I forgot to prepare seats today." "Then, let's talk next time!" Zhou Guoqiang and other worker representatives immediately left. The manager's "forgetting" did not happen just once, but the worker representatives simply said: "No seats, no talk!" Even in the smallest details, the workers did not forget the struggle. In this way, the company's manager, in order to avoid another worker strike, had to put away some of his airs and had to invite them to sit down opposite him when Zhou Guoqiang and other worker representatives came to negotiate. Under the pressure of the workers, the imperialist agent finally had to fulfill his promises.

    The more acute the workers' struggle, the more restless and uneasy the dying Jiang Jieshi bandit gang and imperialist elements felt. Zhou Guoqiang was later "explicitly wanted" by the reactionaries. He hid, transferred, and retreated, finally arriving in the liberated areas. However, not long after, the Chinese People's Liberation Army quickly liberated Shanghai. On the second day after the city's liberation, Zhou Guoqiang's comrades drove the red car he was familiar with to welcome him. He embraced them.

    On November 2nd of last year, the Shanghai Municipal People's Government, in order to serve the interests of the public and the needs of municipal construction, ordered that the Shanghai French Tramway and Electric Light Company be taken over by local state ownership and its property be managed on its behalf. At the same time, the Shanghai Hunnan Water, Electricity and Transportation Company was announced to be established, and Zhou Guoqiang was appointed as the deputy manager of this company. He saw the former manager of this company – the agent of imperialism – again.

      "Comrade, you asked me about my experience from the tram to the manager's office, and the few memories I have of that former manager. I can talk about it more clearly. To be honest, it is much easier than talking about principles. It is very concrete and deeply imprinted in my heart. ... As for my thoughts on the draft constitution, there are thousands of words, and I don't know where to start."

    I don't need to ask him for more thoughts. I will never forget the last sentence he said to me: "The draft constitution embodies the will of the working class that has won victory after arduous struggle. Just from the changes in the struggle I have personally experienced, what do you think my mood should be like today? What could be more important than consolidating the leadership of the working class?"

    Everyone has different struggles and lives. Dear comrades, on the day the draft constitution is published, recall the changes in your struggles and lives. What kind of understanding should you have?

### 斗争带来的变化

    斗争带来的变化
    张友济
    斗争使事情发生了变化。这些变化有的写在历史的书页上，有的印在人们的心里。
    宪法草案公布以后，我去访问一位参加过三次起义斗争的老工人。从他一身所经历的几次变化中，可以看到我们工人阶级地位变化的缩影。他是现任上海市沪南水电交通公司副经理周国强同志。
    这个公司被人民政府收归地方国营不过半年多；它曾经挂着帝国主义的招牌达半个世纪之久——当然，工人阶级在这里所进行的斗争也是由来已久的事。从周国强到这里来做卖票工人的第一天算起，到现在快有三十个年头了。
    今天，在电话铃时常震响着的经理室里，我们可以看到周国强坐在写字台前，戴着老花眼镜，聚精会神地办着公事；有时，他立起来，热忱地接待来谈工作的工人。在清晨公司开出第一辆交通车辆的路线上，工人们也时常可以看到他的穿着蓝制服的胖胖的身影，在那里，他和售票员或司机大声地热烈地谈着话。谁都知道，这些事情在今天都是毫不为奇的，可是在过去的日子里，这个公司的经理——帝国主义的代理人，却不是一个普通工人能够见到面的。
    周国强第一次看见过去的经理是在一九二七年三月，正当上海工人阶级第三次起义得到胜利的时候。那时，上海南市三山会馆悬挂着写着“上海总工会南市纠察总部”的横幅。这个公司参加起义的纠察队员有八十人，总部决定让一半人先回去复工。在工人的要求下，帝国主义的领事馆、巡捕房以及这个公司的代表、头儿和经理，不得不坐着汽车到三山会馆来迎接他们原先下令开除的工人复工。那时候，周国强第一次看到了公司的经理。看起来，他们比以前“谦逊”得多了，汽车老远就停下来了，帽子也老早脱下来了，他们鞠着躬走进那门口站着手执武器的工人的三山会馆。
    起义是怎么一回事呢？这里只举周国强所参加的一支队伍的例子。三月二十一日中午，南市救火会“噹、噹、噹”的钟声报道第三次起义开始了。周国强和许多工人一样，从路线上把车辆赶着开回厂里，人们迅速到工会集中。接着，一百多人的队伍出发了。武器却只有三枝枪：一枝盒子枪，一枝左轮，一枝“六寸头”手枪。盒子枪只有八粒子弹，左轮的子弹都装到枪里面了，而那枝“六寸头”，已经放不响了。另外，有四十把从救火会搞来的斧头。因此，大部分人赤手空拳，或者只拿着一根当时“童子军”用的绳子。我们的周国强那时候还被工人弟兄笑称为“小鬼”，他好容易经过“横争竖吵”，总算拿到一把斧头。“到敌人那里去拿武器”，起义军出发了。终于，绳子捆住了孙传芳的大刀队员，斧头劈开了紧闭着的反动机关的大门，缴获了大批的武器，他们占领了道台衙门——当时的反动政府的中心。
    在斗争中，实际力量的对比关系变化了，这个公司的经理——帝国主义的代理人脱下了帽子。
    为时不久，同年四月十二日，那个曾经向三次起义胜利的工人阶级亲赠过“共同奋斗”的锦旗的大骗子、大强盗、帝国主义的大走狗蒋介石叛变了革命，上海工人用生命换得来的胜利被蒋介石劫夺了。蒋介石屠杀着英勇的工人。革命暂时失败了。帝国主义又换上一副狰狞的面孔。最后回到公司复工的参加起义的工人纠察队员四十人，全部被开除了。
    工人阶级的斗争并没有因为蒋介石匪帮与帝国主义勾结起来进行屠杀和恐吓而终止。从大革命以后直到上海解放前夕，就在这个公司里，使帝国主义、汉奸、反动派胆战心惊的罢工一个接着一个爆发。在多少次的罢工中间，工人运动的领袖被屠杀了，不少的工人遭到了逮捕和监禁，更多的工人被逼着做苦力。然而斗争是坚持下来了，斗争随时随地进行着。抗日战争胜利以后，这个公司的工人的团结有了进一步的增强。一九四六年三月，工人自己的工会正式成立的一天，公司的经理表面上也不得不送上花篮，并亲自出席致词祝贺。可是，工人在一九四五年底提出的福利要求，他当时在工人罢工斗争下，满口答应，过后却故意拖延下来，没有全部解决。当周国强和别的工会负责人到一向被看成“禁地”的经理室去找他谈判的时候，他又故意摆出一副不可侵犯的神气：眼睛看着天花板，鼻子说话比嘴巴多。工人代表办交涉有站的地方，没坐的位子。
    蒋介石匪帮怕帝国主义，工人阶级是不怕帝国主义的。周国强有一次站在经理室单刀直入地问道：“公司到底承认不承认我们是代表？既是谈判，到底把我们放在什么地位？”那个老奸巨滑的帝国主义代理人，马上从位子上站起来说：“抱歉，今天忘记了准备座位。”“那么，下次再谈吧！”周国强和别的工人代表马上离开了。经理的“忘记”不是一次，但是，工人代表干脆说：“没坐，不谈！”连最细小的地方，工人也没有忘记斗争。这样，这个公司的经理为了怕工人再度罢工，只好收起一点架子，在周国强和别的工人代表来谈判的时候，不得不请他们在对面坐下来。在工人的压力下，帝国主义代理人最后不得不履行诺言。
    工人的斗争愈尖锐，垂死的蒋介石匪帮和帝国主义分子愈感到寝食不安。周国强后来遭到了反动派的“明令通缉”。他隐蔽、转移、撤退，辗转地到了解放区。可是，没有多少时候，中国人民解放军迅速地解放了上海。在这个城市解放后的第二天，周国强的战友开着他所熟悉的红色汽车来欢迎他。他和他们拥抱在一起了。
    去年十一月二日，上海市人民政府为了我国公众的利益和市政建设需要，下令将上海市法商电车、电灯公司收归地方国营并代管其财产。同时宣布成立上海沪南水电交通公司，周国强被任命为这个公司的副经理，他又看到了原来这个公司的经理——帝国主义的代理人。
      “同志，你问我从电车上到经理室的经过，以及对那位过去的经理的几次回忆，我还可以谈得清楚一些。说实话，这要比谈道理容易得多，它很具体，又是深印在心上的事。……要说到对宪法草案的感想，真是千言万语，一时不知从哪里谈起。”
    我不用再问他更多的感想了。他最后和我说的
  一句话，我怎样也不能忘记：“宪法草案表现了经过艰苦奋斗获得了胜利的工人阶级的意志。就从我个人经过的斗争的变化来看，你看我今天的心情该是怎样的激动？还有什么比巩固工人阶级领导权更重要的事呢？”
    每一个人都有不同的斗争和生活，亲爱的同志们，在宪法草案公布的今天，回忆一下你的斗争和生活的变化，该有怎样的体会呢？
