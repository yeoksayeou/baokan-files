    Several Questions Regarding Production Internships
    Ji Huaimin
    The Central People's Government Administration Council's "Decision on Strengthening Production Internship Work for Students in Higher Education Institutions and Secondary Technical Schools" was promulgated nearly a year ago. Over the past year, all higher education institutions and secondary vocational schools across the country have listed production internship as part of the entire teaching process in accordance with the spirit indicated in this decision, and have actively led students' production internships.
    Currently, the task of higher education institutions and secondary vocational schools is to improve the quality of production internships based on the achievements and experiences gained in the past year.
    How can the quality of production internships be effectively improved? The following issues should be noted first:
    Formulate and Revise Production Internship Outlines
    In view of the fact that the production internship outline is the most basic document guiding students' production internships, the formulation and revision of the production internship outline has become the primary task of organizing and improving production internships.
    The formulation and revision of production internship outlines is the responsibility of the school's teaching and research office (group). The teaching and research office (group) should not be allowed to entrust the task of formulating and revising production internship outlines solely to individual teachers. Individual teachers can only submit drafts or suggestions to the teaching and research office for the task of formulating and revising the internship outline, and the director of the teaching and research office (group) organizes full discussions at the teaching and research office meeting. When discussing the production internship outline, attention should be paid to opinions from enterprises and institutions. The opinions from enterprises and institutions are sometimes submitted indirectly to the meeting by teachers who have already obtained the opinions of the enterprises and institutions; sometimes the leaders of enterprises and institutions are invited to directly participate in the discussion. No matter what method is used, it is always very necessary to listen to the opinions of enterprises and institutions on the production internship outline, otherwise, it cannot be guaranteed that the internship outline is practical and feasible.
    As for the content of the internship outline, it should first clarify the purpose and task of this internship according to the requirements of the teaching plan, followed by the arrangement of the internship program and time, the content of the internship, the methods of internship and inspection methods, visits between internships, theoretical study, and other items. All of these must be included in the internship outline, otherwise, it cannot play a real guiding role.
    Once the formulated and revised production internship outline is approved by the leadership, it must be carefully implemented, and the items in it must not be arbitrarily changed or reduced, because the internship outline and the teaching syllabus are equally important to ensure the standards of the cadres trained by the school. However, in the past, some school's teaching and research offices (groups) adopted a very unserious attitude towards the work of formulating and revising internship outlines: some internship outlines were not discussed at the teaching and research office (group) meeting, and some were discussed very hastily. Of course, the internship outlines formulated or revised in this way would not play any guiding role. It should be known that the work of formulating and revising internship outlines is not easy, and it must be done with effort. Only by adopting a serious and responsible attitude towards the most basic issue of formulating and revising internship outlines can production internships be carried out smoothly.
    The Leadership of Enterprises and Institutions
    Based on past experience, in future production internship work, in addition to strengthening the leadership of teachers over production internships, it is also necessary to strongly emphasize the leading role of enterprises and institutions in production internships. Emphasizing the leading role of enterprises and institutions in production internships is a key issue in changing the current internship situation and improving the quality of internships. Although some cadres in enterprises and institutions still have different views on this issue, the experience of the Soviet Union and our practice have fully confirmed that the practice of strengthening the leadership of enterprises and institutions in production internships is correct. The saying that "strengthening the leadership of enterprises and institutions in production internships will dilute the leading role of teachers" is unfounded. The facts tell us that the enterprise or institution that cares most about production internships, and the direct leaders and general leaders it sends are the strongest, the more significant the students' performance is. Conversely, the enterprise or institution that is indifferent to production internships and is unwilling to assign direct leaders and general leaders with certain capabilities, the smaller the harvest the students feel during the internship. Why is this so? Obviously, although production internship is a part of the teaching process, it is, after all, for students to engage in practical work or technical operations in enterprises and institutions, and the people who are most familiar with the actual work and technical operations of their own enterprises and institutions are, of course, not the school teachers but the cadres of the enterprises and institutions, which is beyond doubt. If we admit this, emphasizing the leading role of enterprises and institutions in internships is very necessary.
    In the past year, the leadership of enterprises and institutions in production internships has generally been conscientious and responsible, but the phenomenon of unattendedness still exists in a few enterprises and institutions, which is because some enterprises and institutions lack a clear understanding of the importance of production internships, emphasizing the contradiction between production, work, and internship tasks, and are unwilling to designate internship leaders, and some, although they have designated them, are unwilling to reduce the original work tasks of these leaders, resulting in only the name but not the reality. In this case, students cannot get technical guidance from enterprise leaders, and can only rely on teachers, and teachers are not familiar with the production and work of enterprises and institutions, resulting in the phenomenon of "students revolving around teachers, and teachers are also outsiders." In this way, students cannot complete their technical operations or practical work tasks item by item in accordance with the internship outline, and the so-called theoretical verification and the exercise of skilled skills are greatly affected. Of course, the task of improving the quality of internships cannot be talked about. Therefore, emphasizing the leading role of enterprises and institutions in production internships is very necessary.
    To strengthen the leading role of enterprises and institutions in internships, while emphasizing the necessity of enterprise and institution leadership in internships, it is also necessary to be good at finding the reasons for this neglect or abandonment of enterprise and institution leadership responsibilities. It is understood that the indifference of some enterprise cadres to internship work is because they believe that production internships only bring "trouble" to enterprises and institutions, without any benefits, which is of course a one-sided and incorrect view. The Administration Council's decision pointed out that "...as long as the internship is properly organized, it will not only not hinder the completion of its own production and work tasks, but also help the completion of production and work tasks." The problem is that we still lack specific and systematic experience in properly organizing production internships, and we cannot make good use of this group of people to assist in completing certain possible production or work tasks when accepting interns. Nor are we good at inducing students and leading teachers to become interested in certain specialized issues in enterprises and institutions, thereby inspiring them to make rationalization proposals to enterprises to improve work. It should be known that production internship is a good opportunity to lead to the combination of science and production, and science to serve production. Enterprises and institutions should not only help students complete all the tasks stipulated in the production internship; on the other hand, they should also see the benefits that production internships bring to enterprises and institutions. Based on the above views, we believe that the responsibility of schools and enterprises and institutions is common for completing the task of production internship.
    In order to ensure the leadership of enterprises and institutions in internships, according to the spirit indicated in the Administration Council's decision, enterprises and institutions should designate fixed general internship leaders and direct leaders, and should, as far as possible, be filled by more skilled cadres from the departments, divisions, and sections of the enterprises and institutions. In the case that they cannot completely leave their posts, the leadership of the enterprises and institutions should give them a certain amount of time to guide the internship. The person in charge of the enterprise and institution should also pay attention to the progress of the internship work and make necessary supervision and inspection. Only in this way can the leading role of enterprises and institutions be truly strengthened, and can the quality of internships be effectively improved.
    Internship Methods
    Internship methods are determined by the nature of the major (engineering, agriculture, finance, economics, politics, law, etc.) and the nature of the internship (familiarization internship, professional production internship, graduation internship).
    At present, there are more problems with the internship methods of professional production internships, and professional production internships are the focus of the national production internship this year. Here, I am going to talk about some personal experiences and opinions on the methods of professional production internships.
    In order to better explain the methods of professional production internships, it is necessary to first study the purpose of professional production internships. According to the regulations of the Provisional Regulations on Production Internships recently issued by the Ministry of Higher Education of the Central Government: "Professional production internship: The purpose is to enable students to directly participate in production operations and practical work in relevant units such as work sections, workshops, farms, and laboratories that are close to their major, so as to obtain preliminary skills in engaging in production operations and practical work; and to enable the professional knowledge they have learned to be actually applied to production and work and be consolidated." In the past year, our professional production internships, whether engineering or finance and economics, have not fully met this requirement. On the contrary, many students in engineering majors who should have personally participated in actual operations can only observe or listen to lectures; many students in finance and economics majors who should have personally participated in actual work can only visit or listen to reports. It is understood that reducing the method of professional production internship to allowing students to simply listen or watch has seriously affected the quality of production internships. The creation of this situation is not accidental, and the reasons are:
    First, from schools to enterprises and institutions, there is still a lack of systematic experience in the teaching link of production internship itself, and the mutual relationship and differences between familiarization internships, professional production internships, and graduation internships are not clearly understood. In this way, it will of course be difficult to decide on the internship methods of various different natures, and it is impossible to stipulate the methods of completing the internship in the internship outline at the same time. The internship outline, which is the most basic document for guiding students' internships, lacks an "instruction method" item, which is nothing to follow for students, teachers, and enterprise leaders.
    Second, it is a kind of spontaneous resistance from some enterprises and institutions to students engaging in actual operations or actual work. The generation of this spontaneous resistance is that some employees of enterprises and institutions often do not like to have these students who have no production experience and work experience participate in production operations or actual work, fearing that they will damage the tools and affect the quality of production or work, and even some direct leaders sent by enterprises and institutions encourage students to "watch more, listen more, and don't do anything."
    Third, it is a one-sided understanding from the student side. This one-sided understanding is that the purpose of production internship is mistakenly understood as being just for writing reports. What some students are concerned about during the internship is often the writing of the report, so students prefer to listen to more reports and explanations, and read more materials and charts, etc., because this makes it easier to complete the internship report. This is more prominent in finance and economics majors.
    Fourth, among the leading teachers, based on their habits of engaging in teaching and research work, they like to have students "study more problems and think more about problems," and thus, to a certain extent, they accommodate some students' wrong ideas.
    In order to ensure the quality of production internships, schools and enterprises and institutions must correct this incorrect understanding and practice. Only when schools and enterprises and institutions jointly attach importance to production internships can production internships be carried out in an effective manner. The so-called effective method, for professional production internships, is to have students, under the leadership of the internship leaders and teachers of the enterprises and institutions, directly participate in production operations and actual work in units such as work sections, workshops, farms, and laboratories that are close to their major, according to the outline of the production internship. The so-called direct participation in production operations and actual work, of course, must also be combined with necessary visits, listening to reports, and tutoring.
    There are two tendencies that must be prevented, that is, one is to separate students from actual operations or actual work and ask them to simply visit, listen to reports, and read documents and charts; the other is to separate students from the internship outline and ask them to engage in too much trivial work that is unrelated to the internship outline. Otherwise, there is no reliable guarantee for improving the quality of production internships. I think that to prevent these two tendencies: first, it should be noted when formulating the internship outline that each internship item should not be too general or too trivial. More importantly, the leading teachers and the leaders of the enterprises and institutions must attach great importance to the formulation of the daily internship plan, because the daily internship plan is formulated according to the requirements of the outline and the production or work characteristics of the enterprises and institutions. The work that students are to engage in must be constrained by this daily plan. Therefore, teachers and the leaders of the enterprises and institutions must properly arrange the work items and time of this daily internship plan. Second, it is necessary to strengthen the leading role of teachers. Because the teacher leading the internship is directly responsible to the school for the quality of the students' production internship, he must provide timely guidance to the students on teaching methods during the internship and regularly check the students' work completion. More importantly, he must establish close contact with the leaders of the enterprises and institutions in order to study the problems reflected in the students' internships and solve them in a timely manner.

    关于生产实习的几个问题
    纪怀民
    中央人民政府政务院“关于加强高等学校与中等技术学校学生生产实习工作的决定”公布将近一年了。一年以来，全国各高等学校和中等专业学校根据这一决定所指示的精神，把生产实习列为整个教学过程的一部分，并积极领导了学生的生产实习。
    目前，高等学校和中等专业学校的任务，是如何在过去一年所取得的成绩和经验的基础上，把生产实习从质量上提高一步。
    怎样才能有效地提高生产实习的质量呢？首先应该注意以下几个问题：
    制定和修订生产实习提纲
    鉴于生产实习提纲是指导学生进行生产实习的最基本的文件，因而制定和修订生产实习提纲，便成为组织和改进生产实习的首要工作。
    制定和修订生产实习提纲是学校教学研究室
  （组）的责任，不能允许教学研究室（组）把制定和修订生产实习提纲的任务仅仅委托给教师个人来完成。教师个人对制定和修订实习提纲的任务，只能是向教学研究室提出草案或建议，由教学研究室（组）主任在教学研究室会议上组织充分的讨论。在讨论生产实习提纲时要注意到来自企业、机关方面的意见。企业、机关方面的意见，有时候是教师把已经征得的企业、机关的意见间接提交到会议上来；有时候是邀请企业、机关的领导人直接参加讨论。不管用什么方式，倾听企业、机关方面对生产实习提纲的意见总是十分必要的，否则便不能保证实习提纲的切实可行。
    至于实习提纲的内容，应根据教学计划的要求，首先阐明本次实习的目的和任务，然后便是实习程序和时间的安排、实习的内容、实习的方法以及检查方法、实习间的参观、理论学习等项。所有这些都必须包括在实习提纲中，否则便不能起真正的指导作用。
    制定和修订好的生产实习提纲既经领导方面批准，便须认真执行，不能任意改变或削减其中的项目，因为实习提纲和教学大纲同样都是保证学校培养干部的规格的。但是，过去在某些学校的教学研究室（组）中，对制定和修订实习提纲的工作采取了极不严肃的态度：有的实习提纲未在教学研究室（组）会议上讨论，有的讨论得很草率，这样制定或修订的实习提纲，当然不会起什么指导作用。要知道，制定和修订实习提纲的工作不是轻而易举的，必须下一番功夫，只有对制定和修订实习提纲这个最基本的问题采取认真负责的态度，才能使生产实习进行得顺利。
    企业、机关的领导问题
    根据以往的经验，在今后的生产实习工作中，除了必须加强教师对生产实习的领导外，还必须十分强调企业、机关对生产实习的领导作用。强调企业、机关对生产实习的领导作用，是改变目前实习状况、提高实习质量的一个带有关键性的问题。尽管某些企业、机关的干部对这个问题还存在着不同的看法，但苏联的经验和我们的实践都充分证实了加强企业、机关对生产实习的领导的作法是正确的。所谓“加强企业、机关对生产实习的领导，会冲淡教师的领导作用”的说法是没有根据的。事实告诉我们，那一个企业、机关对生产实习最关心，派出的直接领导人和总领导人最强，那里实习的学生的成绩也最显著。相反，那一个企业、机关对生产实习漠不关心，不肯指派具有一定能力的直接领导人和总领导人，那里实习的学生便感到收获很小。为什么是这样呢？很明显，生产实习虽然是教学过程的一部分，然而它毕竟是要学生在企业、机关中从事实际工作或技术操作，而对本企业、机关的实际工作和技术操作最熟练的，当然不会是学校的教师而是企业、机关的干部，这是无须怀疑的。如果我们承认这一点，强调企业、机关对实习的领导作用便非常必要了。
    过去一年，企业、机关对生产实习的领导，一般都是认真负责的，但在少数企业、机关中无人照管的现象仍然存在，这是由于某些企业、机关对生产实习的重要性还缺乏明确的认识，强调生产、工作和实习任务的矛盾，不肯指定实习领导人，有的虽然指定了但不肯减少这些领导人原有的工作任务，结果仅有其名而无其实。在这种情况下，学生得不到企业领导人的技术指导，便只能单单依靠教师，而教师对企业、机关的生产、工作不熟悉，结果便造成“学生围着教员转，教员也是门外汉”的无人照管的现象。这样，学生就不可能按照实习提纲，逐项完成他的技术操作或实际工作任务，所谓理论的印证和熟练技巧的锻炼便大受影响，当然，提高实习质量的任务，也无从谈起了。所以，强调企业、机关对生产实习的领导作用是非常必要的。
    要加强企业、机关对实习的领导作用，在强调企业、机关对实习领导的必要性的同时，还必须善于找出存在这种忽视或放弃企业、机关领导责任的原因。据了解，某些企业干部对实习工作的淡漠，是因为他们认为生产实习为企业、机关所带来的只是“麻烦”，而没有一点好处，这种看法当然是片面的、不正确的。政务院的决定指出，“……只要妥善地组织实习，不仅不妨碍自己完成生产与工作任务，而且有助于生产和工作任务的完成”，问题在于我们对于妥善地组织生产实习还缺乏具体的系统的经验，在接受实习生时还不能很好地利用这批力量去协助完成某些可能完成的生产或工作任务。也不善于诱导学生和领导教师对企业、机关中的某些专门问题发生兴趣，从而启发他们向企业提出改进工作的合理化建议。要知道，生产实习正是导致科学和生产相结合、科学为生产服务的一个良好机会，企业、机关一方面要帮助学生全部完成生产实习所规定的任务；另一方面还要看到生产实习为企业、机关所带来的利益。基于以上的看法，我们认为对完成生产实习这个任务来说，学校和企业、机关的责任是共同的。
    为了保证企业、机关对实习的领导，根据政务院决定所指示的精神，企业、机关应该指定固定的实习总领导人和直接领导人，并应尽可能以各该企业、机关部、处、科的较熟练的干部来充任，在不能完全脱离职务的情况下，企业、机关的领导方面，要给予他们一定时间来指导实习。企业、机关的负责人，也应该关注实习工作的进行，并作必要的监督和检查。只有这样，才能真正加强企业、机关的领导作用，也才能使实习质量得到有效的提高。
    实习方式
    实习方式决定于专业性质（工、农、财经、政法等）和实习性质（认识实习、专业生产实习、毕业实习）。
    目前，在实习方式上，问题较多的是专业生产实习，而专业生产实习，又是本年度全国生产实习的重点。这里我准备就专业生产实习的方式讲些个人的体会和意见。
    为了便于阐明专业生产实习的方式，有必要先研讨一下专业生产实习的目的。按中央高等教育部最近颁发的生产实习暂行规程的规定：“专业生产实习：其目的是使学生在与其所学专业相接近的工段、车间、农场及实验室等有关单位中，直接参加生产操作与实际工作，以获得从事生产操作与实际工作的初步技能；并使所学的专业知识，能够实际应用到生产与工作中而得到巩固。”过去一年以来，我们的专业生产实习不管工科、还是财经科，都没有完全达到这个要求，相反的许多工科专业的学生应该亲身参加实际操作的却只能见习或听讲；许多财经科专业的学生应该亲身参加实际工作的，也只能参观或听报告。据了解，把专业生产实习的方式降低到让学生单纯的听或看的境地，严重地影响了生产实习的质量。这种情况的造成不是偶然的，其原因是：
    第一、从学校到企业、机关，对生产实习这个教学环节本身还缺少系统的经验，对认识实习、专业生产实习和毕业实习之间的相互关系及其区别还认识不清，这样对于决定各种不同性质的实习方式当然会发生困难，在实习提纲中也就不可能同时规定完成实习的方式，而作为指导学生实习最基本文件的实习提纲缺少“指导方法”一项，对学生、教师以及企业领导人来说都是无所遵循的。
    第二、是某些企业、机关对学生从事实际操作或实际工作的一种自发抵触。这种自发抵触的产生，是企业、机关的某些职工，常常不喜欢要这些毫无生产经验和工作经验的学生参加生产操作或实际工作，怕他们损害了工具，影响了生产或工作的质量，甚至企业派出的某些直接领导人也多鼓励学生
  “多看，多听，别动手”。
    第三、是来自学生方面的一种片面认识。这种片面认识是：把生产实习的目的错误地理解成就是为了写报告书。一部分学生在实习过程中所关注的常常是报告书的写作问题，这样，学生便喜欢多听些报告、讲解，多看些资料和图表等，因为这样可以比较容易地完成实习报告书。这在财经专业方面表现得更为突出。
    第四、是领导教师中间，基于自己从事教学和研究工作的习惯，喜欢要学生“多研究问题，多考虑问题”，因而在一定程度上便迁就了一部分学生的错误想法。
    为了保证生产实习的质量，学校和企业、机关必须纠正这种不正确的认识和作法。只有学校和企业、机关共同重视生产实习，才能使生产实习按照有效的方式来进行。所谓有效的方式，对专业生产实习来说，便是要学生根据生产实习的提纲，在企业、机关的实习领导人和教师的领导下，在与其所学专业相接近的工段、车间、农场及实验室等单位，直接参加生产操作和实际工作。所谓直接参加生产操作和实际工作，当然也要结合必要的参观、听报告及辅导等。
    有两种偏向是必须防止的，即一种是脱离实际操作或实际工作，要学生单纯地参观、听报告、阅读文件、图表；另一种则是脱离实习提纲，要学生过多地从事一些和实习提纲无关的烦琐的工作。否则，提高生产实习的质量便没有可靠的保证。我认为，要防止这两种倾向：第一、应该在制定实习提纲时就要注意到使每一个实习项目不要太笼统，太琐碎。更重要的是领导教师和企业、机关的领导人必须十分重视实习逐日计划的制定，因为实习逐日计划是根据提纲要求和企业、机关的生产或工作特点来制定的。学生所要从事的工作都要受到这个逐日计划的约束。所以教师和企业、机关的领导人必须把这个实习逐日计划的工作项目、时间安排得妥当。第二、要加强教师的主导作用。因为领导实习的教师对学生生产实习的质量向学校负有最直接的责任，在实习进行中他要及时地向学生进行教学方法的指导，并经常地检查学生完成工作的状况。更重要的是和企业、机关的领导人建立密切的联系，以便研究学生实习中所反映出来的问题，并及时加以解决。
