Connecting Consumers and Producers
    ——A Record of the Relationship Established Between Taiyuan Department Store Salesman Wang Jinkang and Taiyuan Paper Mill
    By Our Reporter Jin Yukun

    "Lancun Paper" Cannot Be Sold

    Just as the people at the Taiyuan Paper Mill were boasting that "Lancun Paper is flying all over the sky," Wang Jinkang, a salesman at the department store, frowned whenever he saw "Lancun Paper."

    Although he was a well-known model salesman, he was powerless when faced with such a product—paper full of black spots, turning into a blurry mess when written on, and uneven in thickness. No amount of sales experience could help.

    This matter caused great distress to the young salesman Wang Jinkang. Some time ago, he saw at the Taiyuan Printing Factory that because the thickness of the woodfree paper was uneven, the paper would be uneven in length when pressed by the rollers, and the color registration was always inaccurate. The green color in the colored spring afforestation propaganda posters they printed for the Forestry Bureau was supposed to be on the leaves, but instead it ran off to the side, as if the leaves were flying in the air. Even worse, the label paper contained too much sand. As long as the printing time was slightly longer, the rollers would be covered with sand, and when printing Shunfeng cigarette boxes, they were always printed in white patches. They also had to take the blame for others frequently.

    While Wang Jinkang was troubled by the unsalability of the paper, the amount of paper piled up in the warehouse was increasing. The paper in the three warehouses was stacked from the floor to the ceiling, then from the corridor to the full courtyard, with no more space available. When doing economic accounting, everyone was shocked to calculate: the amount of stockpiled Lancun paper had exceeded the total amount of working capital for all department store commodities in Taiyuan City, and the annual interest paid for it would be 9 billion yuan.

    Wang Jinkang thought that the root of the problem was the quality of the paper. Why not reflect the consumers' opinions to the paper mill to urge them to improve quality? But Wang Jinkang was afraid that some ordinary opinions would not really have any effect. Just as he was hesitating, the chairman of the trade union, Su Shi, encouraged him, saying, "What you are reflecting is the opinion of thousands of consumers, and this opinion itself is a kind of power."

      On March 28, 1953, the first production and sales forum was held in Lancun. Wang Jinkang, through leading comrades, conveyed the opinions he had collected from consumers to the Taiyuan Paper Mill.

      Because of Complacency

    It turned out that "Lancun Paper" had indeed "flown all over the sky" in the previous two years, selling well in major cities such as Shanghai, Tianjin, and Guangzhou, and had also been exhibited in countries such as Germany, Czechoslovakia, and India. Merchants from all over came to buy it, and words of praise were often heard.

    At this time, some people believed that the market reputation of "Lancun Paper" had already been established, and quality was not a major issue. Therefore, they only revelled in the increase in quantity. The speed of the machines was frantically increased, but there were no corresponding measures to ensure quality. Whenever a new record appeared, without asking about the quality, they would shout loudly "New Atmosphere," intentionally or unintentionally condoning everyone's sloppy work.

    Some technicians thought: "We are the first manufacturer of self-made typing paper in China, and the quality we have is almost as good as it gets!" Because of complacency, technology stagnated.

    Some workers said: "As long as the radishes sell quickly, it doesn't matter if they are not washed" (meaning that if business is good, it doesn't matter if the goods are a little worse). Female material selectors often carelessly let go of rubber soles, buttons, and other debris mixed in with rags and broken shoes. This caused serious consequences. On one square meter of paper, the average number of black spots reached as many as 1,500.

    However, the leaders of the paper mill had not yet noticed the quality problem of the paper, but instead believed that the main problem with the paper not being sold was the sales methods of the department store. The situation became more and more serious. At the beginning of last year, the sales volume of "Lancun Paper" was greatly reduced, and the factory had to borrow money to survive.

      Consumers' Opinions Reach the Paper Mill

    Hou Xiaoxian—a labor model at the paper mill and a papermaker for more than 30 years—listened to the comrades from the department store at the forum and learned that due to the poor quality of the paper, it could not meet the needs of consumers, seriously accumulating national funds, and affecting the normal operation of state-owned commerce. Hou Xiaoxian thought: It turns out that the products we have worked so hard to produce are not fast-selling goods but unsalable goods, not welcomed but scolded everywhere. He felt deeply saddened.

    Consumers' opinions awakened the leading comrades of the paper mill. They thanked Wang Jinkang for reflecting the consumers' opinions in a timely manner. They took a series of technical measures, held quality exhibitions, and conducted in-depth ideological education to improve quality among the workers.

    The production situation of the Taiyuan Paper Mill began to change.

    Cleanliness is very important for a paper mill. Because as long as there is a speck of dirt the size of a cotton seed in the pulp, it will turn into 340,000 black spots on the paper, making more than 200 sheets of paper completely useless. The selection of materials must be particularly clean. The female material selectors Ma Bianhua and Wang Cuimei created a mutual-aid material selection method, increasing the selection from once to three times, and put forward the slogan "Do not let a piece of rubber pass through." In this way, the rags and broken shoes were all selected cleanly, and after being steamed in the pulp workshop, they turned into snow-white and delicate pulp.

    Labor model Hou Xiaoxian played a leading role in improving quality. He saw that the material selection work was done well, but there were still many black spots on the paper. What was the reason? He stared intently for several nights in a row, watching where the dirt coming down in the pulp was coming from. The reason was finally discovered in the least noticeable place. It turned out that the slurry pipe from the return water tower to the coordinating twenty-odd zhang had not been cleaned for more than 20 years, and a lot of dirt had accumulated here. Hou Xiaoxian personally started cleaning, removing more than 40 kilograms of pig iron, rubber, verdigris, etc. This solved a major key problem.

    The factory leaders also organized technicians to go to the workshop to help workers improve quality. Engineer Song Jieke spent all day in the workshop with the workers, studying and solving the problem of paper uniformity, how to coordinate the machine speed and the slurry speed. Based on the workers' experience, they repeatedly experimented and found that the water level of the pulp was most suitable at 1.45 meters. According to this conclusion, operating procedures were formulated. Once the paper uniformity was good, you couldn't see the clouds in the sky.

    The workers put forward more than 20 effective ways to improve quality. The three major problems that affected quality in the past—poor material selection, unclean slurry channels, and uneven thickness—have been basically solved. The quality was rapidly improved, and the number of black spots on the paper decreased from 1,500 to 120.

    In May, beautiful good paper came out. This encouraged Wang Jinkang even more. He said: "I didn't expect consumers' opinions to be so effective. Opinions were raised in March, and in May, good paper that everyone praises was produced!"

    The workers at the printing factory told Wang Jinkang: "The opinions you reflected are really effective. The paper is better, which is of great help to us in improving the printing quality." They repeatedly urged Wang Jinkang to keep in touch with the paper mill in the future.

      Dear Friends

    In August, Wang Jinkang watched "Dawn Over Moscow." This drama was very inspiring to him. He thought: Aren't the complacent attitude of the paper mill leaders and that conservative female factory director the same in not understanding the masses and not understanding the needs of consumers? Isn't the liaison system established by Sanya and the agricultural town collective farm also budding here? Late at night, Wang Jinkang sat at the small table in front of his bed and wrote a letter to Hou Xiaoxian, a labor model at the paper mill, with excitement:

      "Please don't be surprised that I'm writing to you presumptuously, because although we have never met, we are close in our work relationship. The paper you produce has to be sold by us—the salesmen. But in order for us to complete the sales task, we must have paper that meets the needs of the masses. If your products are not good, we will not be able to sell them. In this way, your production will inevitably be affected. Therefore, our work is inseparable. So I think: We can also establish a socialist liaison system. In fact, we have already started this liaison, but we have not yet realized it. This liaison system will make our commodities more popular with consumers, and you will produce more beautiful products because you have consumers supervising you. Dear friends, let us shake hands warmly for a common purpose—to serve consumers better!"

    Since then, the opinions of consumers and producers have been exchanged frequently through the two of them.

    Last September, Wang Jinkang forwarded the opinion from a printing factory in the Northwest that one ream of paper was missing 40 sheets of paper. The leaders of the paper mill immediately published the consumers' criticism on the bulletin board, which had a great effect, and everyone's work became more meticulous.

    In the fourth quarter of last year, the market needed glazed paper the most, but the paper mill planned to produce the most label paper. After Wang Jinkang reflected this situation, the paper mill, with the approval of the superior, revised the original plan, thus avoiding the shortage of glazed paper.

    At the beginning of this year, new complacency began to rise in the paper mill. Wang Jinkang promptly warned the paper mill about the fluctuations in quality reflected by consumers, such as the problem of water penetration in a batch of typing paper in Tianjin. This alerted the leaders of the paper mill and they took measures in a timely manner.

    This made the leaders of the paper mill deeply realize that only by constantly and humbly listening to the opinions of consumers can they keep their minds clear.

    Praising His Pioneering Spirit

    The sales of "Lancun Paper" have expanded again, from five cities in the past to 51 cities across the country. By July of last year, it accounted for more than 79% of the total paper sales of Taiyuan Department Store, and the sales volume of glazed paper increased by 13 times. The price of paper has also been reduced.

    Due to the low price and high quality of "Lancun Paper," it is not only selling well in cities, but also gradually penetrating into the vast rural areas.

    This Spring Festival, labor model Hou Xiaoxian led a delegation of workers to visit the Nanyinbi Production Cooperative in Hongdong County. As soon as they arrived in the village, they felt that the scene here was brand new. Looking closely, every household here used their glazed paper to paste the windows, which were white and bright. The head of the cooperative, Liu Hongyu, took Hou Xiaoxian's hand and said: "Since your glazed paper has dropped from 800 yuan to 400 yuan per sheet, the members of the cooperative have torn off the black and dark gray paper and replaced it with your white and beautiful paper. Our cooperative uses your glazed paper to write summaries and keep accounts, and even our elementary school's practice books use your paper. Now we use your paper every day. We can't forget you old workers when we use this paper!"

    This visit made Hou Xiaoxian see the practical significance of the liaison system even more deeply. The liaison system helped the factory, helped the department store, helped the city consumers, and also helped the farmer brothers, contributing to the consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance. Hou Xiaoxian deeply felt that he had to listen to the opinions of consumers more humbly in the future, so that the liaison system could play a greater role and produce cheaper and more beautiful products. Thinking of this, he couldn't help but thank Wang Jinkang, who had established contact with him.

    This year, the liaison system established by Wang Jinkang and the paper mill has been widely promoted in state-owned commerce and light industrial factories in Taiyuan City. The liaison system has become an important driving force for improving product quality and reducing costs. Not long ago, at the exchange meeting of advanced experiences in the Shanxi Province trade system, Chairman Pei Lisheng praised Comrade Wang Jinkang's pioneering spirit.

    把消费者和生产者联系起来
    ——记太原百货公司推销员王锦康和太原造纸厂建立联系制度
    本报记者  金雨困
    “兰村纸”推销不出去了
    正当太原造纸厂的人们夸耀“兰村纸满天飞”的时候，百货公司推销员王锦康看到“兰村纸”就愁眉不展。
    尽管他是有名的模范推销员，但是碰到这样的产品——满纸是黑点点，写上字就化成一团，而且厚薄还不匀。他有再好的推销经验也无能为力。
    这事情使年轻的推销员王锦康感到很大的苦恼。前些日子，他在太原印刷厂看到，因为道林纸的厚薄不匀，滚筒一压纸就长短不齐，套色老是套不准。他们为林业局印的套色春季植树宣传画，绿颜色本当套在树叶上的，结果却跑到一旁去了，好像树叶子在空中飞。更糟糕的是那种招贴纸夹带砂子太多，只要印的时间稍长，滚子就沾满了砂，在印顺风牌纸烟盒时，老是印得一块一块白花花。他们为保险公司印了一批传票，结果因纸透水而不能用，人家当然要退货，后来再三交涉，罚了八百万元才算了事。他们还要经常代人受过。
    正在王锦康为了纸张推销不出去而苦恼的时候，仓库积压的纸却越积越多了。三个仓库的纸都是从地板堆到天花板，再从走廊堆到满院子，再也无地可容了。搞经济核算时，一算账谁都吃了一惊：积压的兰村纸已超过了太原全市百货商品的流动资金的总额，每年为它付出的利息就要九十亿元。
    王锦康想，归根结蒂的问题都在纸的质量，为什么不向纸厂反映消费者的意见，促使他们提高质量呢？可是王锦康又怕一些平常的意见不能真正发生什么效果。正在他犹豫的时候，工会主席苏适鼓励他说：“你反映的是千百个消费者的意见，这意见的本身就是一种力量。”
      一九五三年三月二十八日，在兰村举行了第一次产销座谈会，王锦康通过领导同志把他从消费者那里搜集来的意见反映给了太原造纸厂。
      因为自满的缘故
    原来“兰村纸”在前两年时确曾“满天飞”过，畅销上海、天津、广州各大城市，还在德国、捷克斯洛伐克和印度等国展览过。各地商人也都前来争购，赞美的话是常常会钻进耳朵里去的。
    这时候，有些人认为“兰村纸”市场信誉业已建立，质量又不是主要问题，因此只陶醉于数量的增加。车速是拚命地加快，但并无相应保证质量的措施，一出现新纪录不问质量如何，就大叫大喊
  “新气象”，有意无意间纵容了大家粗制滥造。
    有的技术人员认为：“我们是中国自制打字纸的第一家，能有这样的质量也就差不离！”因为自满，技术上就故步自封。
    有的工人说：“只要萝卜卖得快，不洗泥巴也能卖”（意思是生意好了，货差一点是没有关系的）。选料女工们往往把夹在破布烂鞋里的胶皮底、扣子等杂物都马马虎虎地放了过去。这就造成了严重的后果。在一平方公尺的一张纸上，黑点平均竟达一千五百个之多。
    可是纸厂的领导人员还没注意到纸的质量问题，反而认为纸卖不出去主要是百货公司销售方法上有问题。情况越来越严重，去年年初，“兰村纸”销售量大为缩减，厂里不得不借债度日。
      消费者的意见到了纸厂
    侯效贤——纸厂的劳动模范，三十多年的造纸工人——在座谈会上听了百货公司来的同志介绍的情况：由于纸张质量不好，不能满足消费者的需要，严重地积压国家的资金，并影响了国营商业的正常经营。侯效贤想道：原来我们辛辛苦苦劳动出来的产品，不是畅销货而是滞销货，不是受人欢迎而是到处挨骂。他深深感到痛心。
    消费者的意见惊醒了纸厂的领导同志。他们感谢王锦康及时反映了消费者的意见。他们采取了一系列的技术措施，举行质量展览会，在职工群众中进行了深入的提高质量的思想教育。
    太原造纸厂的生产情况开始改变了。
    清洁工作对纸厂来说，是非常重要的。因为只要在纸浆中带有棉籽那么大的一粒脏物，到了纸上它就会变成三十四万个黑点，使二百多张纸全成废品。清洁工作中特别重要的是选料要选得干净。选料女工麻变花和王翠梅创造了互助选料法，由选一次增加到连选三次，并提出了“不让一块胶皮过关”的口号。这样就使破布烂鞋都选得干干净净，经过纸浆车间一蒸煮就变成雪白细腻的纸浆了。
    劳动模范侯效贤在改进质量中更起着带头作用。他看到选料工作做得蛮好，可是出来的纸上，黑点还是很多，这是什么原因呢？他一连几个晚上一股劲儿地瞅着，看着纸浆里一阵一阵下来的脏物究竟是来自何处？原因终于在最不受人注意的地方发现了。原来在从回水塔到配合它的二十余丈的下浆管已有二十多年没有清洗，这里积下了许多脏物。侯效贤即亲自下手清洗，清除了四十多斤的生铁、胶皮、绿锈等等。解决了一个重大的关键问题。
    厂里领导同志还组织技术人员下车间帮助工人改进质量。工程师宋捷科整天在车间和工人们研究解决纸张的匀度问题，如何使车速和浆速协调起来，根据工人的经验反复试验，找出纸浆的水位在
  一点四、五公尺的地方最为适宜，根据这个结论制订了操作规程。纸张匀度一好，往空照时就看不到
  一团团的云彩了。
    工人群众一共提出了改进质量的有效办法二十多件。过去影响质量的三大问题——选料不好、下浆道不清洁、厚薄不匀——都得到了基本解决。质量迅速改进，纸张上的黑点由一千五百个下降到一百二十个。
    五月份漂亮的好纸就出来了。这就更加鼓舞了王锦康，他说：“想不到消费者的意见这样顶事，三月份提了意见，到五月里就生产出呱呱叫的好纸了！”
    印刷厂的工人告诉王锦康：“托你反映的意见真管事，纸好了，对我们提高印刷质量就有很大帮助。”他们再三嘱咐王锦康今后还要和纸厂多多联系。
      亲爱的朋友
    八月里，王锦康看了“曙光照耀着莫斯科”。这个话剧对他启发很大。他想：纸厂领导同志的自满情绪和那位保守的女厂长，不都是一样的不了解群众，不了解消费者的需要吗？桑妮亚和农业城集体农庄建立的联系制度，在我们这里不是也有了萌芽吗？深夜，王锦康在床前小桌上，带着兴奋的心情给纸厂劳动模范侯效贤写信：
      “请不要奇怪我冒昧地写信给你，因为我们虽然没有见过面，但我们在工作关系上是亲密的，你们生产的纸张，要经过我们——推销员卖出去，但是我们要完成推销任务，那就非有合乎群众需要的纸张不可，如果你们的产品不好，我们就推销不了，这样，你们的生产也必然会受到影响。因此我们的工作是不可分割的。所以我想：我们之间也可以建立一种社会主义的联系制度，事实上我们已开始了这种联系，只是我们还没有意识到罢了。这种联系制度——将使我们的商品更加受到消费者的欢迎，而你们也将因有了消费者的督促，会生产出更漂亮的产品来。亲爱的朋友，让我们为共同的目的——为消费者服务得更好些而热烈地握手吧！”
    自此，消费者和生产者的意见，通过他们两人经常交换着。
    去年九月，王锦康转去了西北某印刷厂发现一令纸少了四十张纸的意见，纸厂领导方面即把消费者的批评在布告栏里公布了，收到很大的效果，大家的工作就更精细了。
    去年第四季度，市场最需要的是有光纸，而纸厂计划中生产最多的是招贴纸，王锦康反映这一情况后，纸厂经上级批准后即修改了原计划，因而避免了有光纸的脱节现象。
    今年年初，纸厂新的自满情绪又在开始抬头。王锦康及时把从消费者反映的质量波动现象，如天津有一批打字纸透水的问题，向纸厂提出了警告。使纸厂领导方面及时警惕并采取了措施。
    这就使纸厂的领导者深深地体会到：只有经常虚心倾听消费者的意见，才能使头脑经常保持清醒。
    表扬他的首创精神
    “兰村纸”的销路又扩大了，由过去五个城市推销全国五十一个城市，到去年七月时已占太原市百货公司纸张总销额百分之七十九以上，有光纸的销售量增加了十三倍。纸的价格也降低了。
    由于“兰村纸”价廉物美，不仅畅销城市，也逐渐深入到广大的农村中去了。
    今年春节，劳动模范侯效贤带领着工人代表团去洪洞县南尹璧生产合作社进行访问时，一到村里就感到这里景象全新，细细一看，这里家家户户都用他们的有光纸裱糊了窗户，又白又明亮。社长刘洪玉拉住侯效贤的手说：“自从你们的有光纸从八百元降到四百元一张，合作社的社员家里都撕去了黑乌乌的灰麻纸，换上你们又白又漂亮的纸，咱们合作社写个总结和记个账也都使上你们的有光纸，连咱们的小学校的练字本也用了你们的纸。现在天天使用你们的纸张，用着这个纸就不能忘了你们工人老大哥！”
    这次访问使侯效贤更深刻地看到了联系制度的实际意义，联系制度帮助了工厂，帮助了百货公司，帮助了城市消费者，也帮助了农民弟兄，为巩固工农联盟也尽了一分力量。侯效贤深深地感到：今后还得更加虚心地倾听消费者的意见，使联系制度发挥更大的作用，要生产出更便宜和漂亮的产品来。他想到这里，不由得感谢那个和他建立联系的王锦康来了。
    今年，王锦康和纸厂建立的联系制度，已在太原市国营商业和轻工业工厂中普遍推广起来，联系制度已成为改进产品质量和降低成本的重要推动力量。不久前，在山西省贸易系统先进经验的交流会上，裴丽生主席表扬了王锦康同志的这种首创精神。
