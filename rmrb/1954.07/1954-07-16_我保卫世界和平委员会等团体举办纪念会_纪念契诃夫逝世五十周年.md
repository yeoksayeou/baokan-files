Xinhua News Agency, 15th: The commemorative meeting for the fiftieth anniversary of the death of Anton Pavlovich Chekhov, a world cultural figure and great Russian realist writer, was grandly held at the Capital Youth Palace on the evening of the 15th. The commemorative meeting was jointly organized by the Chinese People's Committee for the Defense of World Peace, the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, the Chinese Writers Association, and the Chinese Dramatists Association.

    On the rostrum of the commemorative meeting, a huge portrait of Chekhov was hung high. The portrait was covered with flowers. On the rostrum were: Chu Tunan, President of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, Hong Shen, Vice President, Qian Junrui, Secretary-General of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, Luo Longji, Standing Committee Member of the Chinese People's Committee for the Defense of World Peace, Zhou Yang, Vice Chairman of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, Zheng Zhenduo and Lao She, members of the Presidium, Mao Dun, Director of the World Peace Council and Chairman of the Chinese Writers Association, Cao Yu, Director of the Chinese Writers Association, Tian Han, Chairman of the Chinese Dramatists Association, and Ouyang Yuqian, Vice Chairman. Also on the rostrum were Hua Sike, Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the Soviet Embassy in China, and Romanin, representative of the Soviet Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries in China.

    Representatives of various people's organizations, famous peace activists and well-known cultural and artistic figures attended the commemorative meeting.

    Foreign guests attending the commemorative meeting included peace activists and cultural figures from various countries in Beijing.

    Diplomatic envoys and embassy staff from various countries in China, as well as journalists from various countries stationed in China, also attended the commemorative meeting.

    The commemorative meeting was presided over and addressed by Mao Dun, Director of the World Peace Council and Chairman of the Chinese Writers Association. He said: Chekhov is one of the most beloved writers by the Chinese people and Chinese writers in world classical literature. His great name has long been known to our people. As early as the beginning of this century, from 1907 onwards, Chekhov's works began to be introduced to our country one after another. Now, most of his important works have been translated into Chinese, and some works even have three or four translations. Lu Xun, the great standard-bearer of the Chinese cultural revolution, was also a lover and translator of Chekhov's works. Since the founding of New China, the work of translating and introducing Chekhov's works has gained new development.

    After discussing Chekhov's works and creative ideas, Mao Dun pointed out: The great revolutionary teachers Lenin and Stalin loved Chekhov's works very much. They had a high evaluation of Chekhov's literary creation and often quoted Chekhov's words and character images in their writings. When the Soviet people were engaged in the great Patriotic War, Stalin paralleled Chekhov's name with the names of many great cultural giants in Russia, calling on the Soviet people to rise up against fascism and to defend the motherland and the brilliant culture of Russia.

    Mao Dun said: Chekhov has been gone for fifty years. But his spirit is still alive today and will live on forever. Today, when we commemorate the great Chekhov, we should first of all learn his great democratic and patriotic ideas, learn his spirit of hating evil as an enemy against oppression, enslavement, and vulgarity, and learn his enthusiasm for loving the motherland, loving the people, loving life, loving labor, and dedicating his own efforts to the ideal cause of the people. Chekhov's realistic creative method of profoundly and simply reflecting social life, as well as his strict requirements for creative work and his hardworking, diligent and creative spirit of labor are also worthy of our writers' study and emulation.

    Next, Tian Han, Chairman of the Chinese Dramatists Association, delivered a report entitled "Learn from Chekhov, the Great Realist Writer Who Firmly Believes in Light and Freedom." The reporter talked about the situation of Chekhov's works being introduced to China, the profound impact of Chekhov's works on the Chinese people and writers, and then reviewed the path taken by this great writer.

    The reporter said: Anton Chekhov's greatness was re-evaluated correctly by the revolutionary people of his motherland after the October Revolution. The rich and exquisite works left behind in his short twenty years of creative life have long become a valuable heritage of his motherland and the world literary scene, and his name has become one of the flags for the progressive people of the world to fight for democracy and peace today. The reporter pointed out: We must learn from Chekhov's love for the motherland and the people and his spirit of serving the motherland and the people; learn from Chekhov's high sense of justice and his heroic struggle against injustice; learn from Chekhov's realistic creative methods.

    The commemorative meeting welcomed Hua Sike, Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the Soviet Embassy in China, with warm applause.

    Hua Sike said: Chekhov, this prose writer and playwright, deeply understood the legacy of his great predecessors and contemporaries—the talented writers of Russian critical realism—and his skills grew up on the basis of this legacy. Chekhov ended the development of critical realism at the end of the nineteenth century, bringing Russian literature to a new stage. Because he was a genius prose writer and novelist, he was able to put complex and profound social content into the concise and precise genre of short stories or novellas.

    Chekhov's entire creation can be said to be a passionate and continuous pursuit—he pursued a rigorous and clear outlook on life, pursued characters who could turn from words to actions, and who could rise up to fight to transform the terrible reality of Tsarist Russia. Year after year, he became more and more eager to participate in active political life and participate in social struggle.

    Hua Sike said: The basic characteristic of Chekhov's realistic technique is that he can express the truth of everyday life, which on the surface does not have anything outstanding or amazing, with a natural, accurate and concise style, expressing the truth of the character of ordinary people rather than outstanding people, and at the same time enabling people to infer the profound social and historical significance behind the daily phenomena and subtle details of this life.

    Hua Sike said: Chekhov embraced with enthusiasm "the hope of living, the hope of participating" in the future creative labor of the motherland, the grand scale of this creative labor, he had already felt in advance. Chekhov lived and worked not only for his own era, but also for the future era, and his ideal of a beautiful humanity also lives in the future era. The era he idealized has finally arrived. Today, the entire Soviet country and all progressive humanity are commemorating this great writer.

    Hua Sike finally said: Chekhov, with all his creations, affirmed the right to enjoy happiness that all ordinary and ordinary people, all laborers and creators should have. His original and outstandingly simple style, his extremely natural, extremely beautiful and touching and impeccable description of all emotions and images, his pain for the phenomenon that people in the exploiting society are dominated by terrible vulgarity, and his unwavering belief in the future happy life of mankind—all these have made Chekhov a friend of all honest ordinary people in all countries of the world.

    At the commemorative meeting, Chinese artists also performed Chekhov's one-act play "The Proposal" and recited Chekhov's short stories.

    我保卫世界和平委员会等团体举办纪念会
    纪念契诃夫逝世五十周年
   【新华社十五日讯】世界文化名人、伟大的俄罗斯现实主义作家安东·帕夫洛维奇·契诃夫逝世五十周年纪念大会，十五日晚在首都青年宫隆重举行。纪念会是由中国人民保卫世界和平委员会、中国人民对外文化协会、中苏友好协会总会、中国作家协会和中国戏剧家协会等团体联合举办的。
    在纪念大会的主席台上，高悬着契诃夫的巨幅画像。画像下布满鲜花。在主席台上的有：中国人民对外文化协会会长楚图南、副会长洪深，中苏友好协会总会总干事钱俊瑞，中国人民保卫世界和平委员会常务委员罗隆基，中国文学艺术界联合会副主席周扬、主席团委员郑振铎、老舍，世界和平理事会理事、中国作家协会主席茅盾，中国作家协会理事曹禺，中国戏剧家协会主席田汉、副主席欧阳予倩。在主席台上的还有苏联驻我国大使馆临时代办华司考，苏联对外文化协会驻华代表罗满宁。
    参加纪念大会的有各人民团体的代表，著名的和平人士和著名的文化艺术界人士等。
    参加纪念会的外宾有在京各国和平人士和文化人士。
    参加纪念会的外宾还有各国驻华使节和使馆人员，各国驻中国记者等。
    纪念大会由世界和平理事会理事、中国作家协会主席茅盾主持并讲话。他说：在世界古典文学中，契诃夫是中国人民和中国作家最喜爱的作家之一。他的伟大的名字很早就已经为我国人民所知道。远在本世纪初，从一九零七年起，契诃夫的作品就开始陆续介绍到我国来，现在他的重要作品大多已经译成中文，有的作品甚至有译本三四种以上。中国文化革命的伟大旗手鲁迅，也是契诃夫作品的爱好者，同时又是翻译者。新中国成立以来，翻译和介绍契诃夫作品的工作又有了新的发展。
    茅盾在论述了契诃夫的作品和创作思想后指出：伟大的革命导师列宁和斯大林是非常热爱契诃夫的作品的，他们对于契诃夫的文学创作有很高的评价，并常在他们的文字当中引用契诃夫的文字和人物的形象。当苏联人民进行伟大的卫国战争时，斯大林曾把契诃夫的名字和俄罗斯许多伟大文化巨匠们的名字相并列，号召苏联人民起来反对法西斯主义和为保卫祖国、保卫俄罗斯的光辉文化而斗争。
    茅盾说：契诃夫离开我们已经五十年了。但是他的精神至今还活着，而且还要永垂不朽地活下去。今天，我们纪念伟大的契诃夫，首先应该学习他的民主主义、爱国主义的伟大思想，学习他反对压迫、反对奴役、反对庸俗的那种嫉恶如仇的精神，学习他爱祖国、爱人民、爱生活、爱劳动，并且以自己的心血献给人民的理想事业的那种热忱。契诃夫的那种深刻而朴素地反映社会生活的现实主义的创作方法，以及他对于创作工作的严格要求和艰苦勤勉的、创造性的劳动精神也是值得我们的作家学习和效法的。
    接着，中国戏剧家协会主席田汉以“向坚信光明自由的伟大现实主义作家契诃夫学习”为题作了报告。报告人谈到了契诃夫的作品被介绍到中国来的情形，谈到了契诃夫的作品对中国人民和作家的深刻影响，接着回顾了这一伟大作家所走过的道路。
    报告人说：安东·契诃夫的伟大在十月革命后被他祖国的革命人民做了重新的正确估定，他短短二十多年创作生活中所遗留下来的丰富而精湛的作品久已成为他祖国和世界文坛的宝贵遗产，他的名字到今天也成为全世界进步人民为民主和平而斗争的旗帜之一。报告人指出：我们要学习契诃夫对祖国对人民的热爱和为祖国为人民而服务的精神；学习契诃夫的高度正义感和对反正义现象的英勇斗争；学习契诃夫现实主义的创作方法。
    纪念大会以热烈的掌声欢迎苏联驻我国大使馆临时代办华司考讲话。
    华司考说：契诃夫，这位散文作家兼剧作家，深入地体会了他的伟大的先驱者及同代人——俄罗斯批判现实主义的天才作家们——的遗产，他的技巧也就是在这种遗产的基础上面成长起来的。契诃夫在十九世纪的末叶结束了批判现实主义的发展，把俄罗斯文学提到了一个新的阶段。由于他是一位天才的散文作家和小说家，他才能够把复杂和深刻的社会内容，放到简炼、精确的短篇或中篇小说的体裁中去。
    契诃夫的全部创作，可说是一种热烈的、长期不断的追求——他追求严整、明朗的人生观，追求能够从言论转到行动、能够奋起为改造沙皇俄国的可怕现实而斗争的人物。年复一年地他愈来愈渴望参加积极的政治生活，参加社会斗争。
    华司考说：契诃夫的现实主义技巧的基本特征，在于他能够以自然、确切而简炼的笔调，表达出了表面上并无若何出色惊人之处的日常生活的真相，表达出了平常人物而不是卓越人物的性格的真相，同时使人能够在这种生活的日常现象与细微情节后面，把深刻的社会和历史的意义推测出来。
    华司考说：契诃夫抱着热烈的心情“希望活下去，希望自己参加”祖国的未来的创造性劳动，这种创造性劳动的壮大规模，他已是预先感觉到了。契诃夫不但为他自己的时代，并且为未来的时代生活着、工作着，他的关于美的人类的理想也就活在未来的时代里。他所理想的时代毕竟到来了。今天，整个苏维埃国家、全体进步的人类，都在纪念着这位伟大的作家。
    华司考最后说：契诃夫以自己的全部创作，肯定了一切平凡和普通的人、一切劳动者和创造者所应有的享受幸福的权利。他那种独创而出色的朴素风格，他对一切感情与形象的极自然、极美妙动人和无可疵责的描写，他对剥削者社会里人们为可怕的庸俗所支配的那种现象的悲痛，以及他对人类的未来幸福生活的始终不渝的信念——这一切使契诃夫成为了世界各国一切正直的普通人民的朋友。
    纪念会上，并由中国的艺术家们演出了契诃夫的独幕剧“求婚”和朗诵了契诃夫的短篇小说。
