Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, July 19th: The first session of the first People's Congress of Xi'an was held from July 14th to 17th. A total of 230 representatives attended the meeting. The meeting discussed the issues of continuing to deeply publicize and discuss the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China, as well as the relayed reports on the abolition of the Northwest Region's first-level administrative institutions and the incorporation of Xi'an into the administrative system of Shaanxi Province. It also elected representatives to the National People's Congress and the Shaanxi Provincial People's Congress.

    During the discussions, the representatives cited the tremendous achievements of Xi'an's various constructions over the past five years, compared the changes in various aspects before and after liberation, and expressed their heartfelt support for the Draft Constitution. The representatives unanimously believed that the Draft Constitution solemnly stipulates that all power in the People's Republic of China belongs to the people, and the organs through which the people exercise their power are the National People's Congress and the local people's congresses at all levels. Therefore, being elected as a people's representative is a great honor. Everyone expressed that, in order to live up to the people's trust, they must maintain close contact with the masses, resolutely implement the various resolutions of the meeting, and strive to achieve the country's general task during the transition period under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao.

    The meeting pointed out that the discussions and publicity on the Draft Constitution in Xi'an over the past month have achieved significant results. In order to make this publicity and discussion known to every household, the representatives stated that they must earnestly carry out in-depth publicity among the people of all strata after the meeting. They also suggested that the Xi'an Constitution Draft Discussion Committee further organize forces, use various methods, and combine the profound changes that have taken place in Xi'an in various aspects over the past five years with the various rights and interests that the people have gained, to explain the main contents of the Draft Constitution, so as to further enhance the socialist consciousness and labor enthusiasm of the broad masses of the people through the publicity and discussion of the Draft Constitution. Many worker and farmer representatives also proposed at the meeting that a labor competition with technological innovation as the main content should be launched to ensure the completion and over-completion of the national production plan; strive to produce more grain, sell the surplus grain to the state, support the country's industrial construction, and support the Draft Constitution with practical actions.

    Regarding the abolition of the first-level administrative institutions of the Northwest Region and the incorporation of Xi'an into the administrative system of Shaanxi Province, the representatives, in addition to fully supporting the decision of the Central People's Government, unanimously believed that the incorporation of Xi'an into the administrative system of Shaanxi Province would be more conducive to the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, strengthen mutual support between industry and agriculture, and provide many favorable conditions for Xi'an's industrial construction.

    Finally, the meeting elected Xi Zhongxun, Zhao Boping, Fang Zhongru, Zhao Zhankui, Li Xiangjiu, Cheng Bairen, Yan Xinmin, and Ma Pingfu as representatives to the National People's Congress through secret ballot, and elected 34 representatives to the Shaanxi Provincial People's Congress. The meeting adopted a congratulatory telegram to Chairman Mao; and passed resolutions on supporting the promulgation of the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China, continuing to deeply publicize and discuss the Draft Constitution among the people of the city, and supporting the abolition of the first-level administrative institutions of the Northwest Region and the incorporation of Xi'an into the administrative system of Shaanxi Province.

    关于撤销西北大区一级行政机构和西安市并入陕西省建制的问题，代表们除完全拥护中央人民政府的决定外，并一致认为，西安市并入陕西省建制后，将更加有利于城乡物资交流、加强工农业的互相支援，给西安市的工业建设提供许多有利条件。
