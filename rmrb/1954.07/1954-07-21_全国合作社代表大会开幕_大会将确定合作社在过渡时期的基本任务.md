Xinhua News Agency, July 20th:

    The First National Congress of Cooperatives of the People’s Republic of China opened in Beijing on the 20th. A total of 526 delegates attended, representing more than 164 million members.

    The venue was decorated solemnly and beautifully. A huge banner hung in the venue with the three basic tasks of the supply and marketing cooperatives during the transition period, as proposed to the Congress by the Provisional Council of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives. The corridors of the venue were filled with congratulatory banners and flags presented to the Congress by cooperatives from all over the country. A chart displayed at the entrance of the venue illustrated the great development of cooperatives in the four years since the All-China Cooperative Workers' Representative Conference was held in 1950. From 1950 to 1953, the number of members increased from more than 20 million to more than 160 million, retail sales and procurement increased more than tenfold, and own funds increased nineteen and a half times. As the integration of national supply and marketing cooperatives and agricultural production became increasingly close, the amount of production materials supplied in 1953 was thirty times the amount supplied in 1950. Cooperatives have more than 132,000 retail stores scattered throughout the country. Supply and marketing cooperatives account for a considerable proportion of the national rural retail sales, playing its role as an assistant to state-owned commerce.

    The presidium, composed of 41 people, sat on the rostrum. The presidium included Cheng Zihua, Acting Director of the Provisional Council of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives, and Ye Jizhuang, Director of the Provisional Supervisory Committee, as well as model workers from cooperatives across the country. Xiao Meiying (female), head of Guantian Township in the Fourth District of Xingguo County, Jiangxi Province, model cooperative member, and leader of the agricultural production mutual aid team, also participated in the presidium. The presidium also included cooperative representatives from seven ethnic minorities, including Tibetan, Uyghur, Hui, Mongolian, Korean, Miao, and Zhuang.

    Members of the Provisional Council and Supervisory Committee in Beijing also attended the congress.

    The congress invited representatives from cooperatives of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the Mongolian People's Republic, the German Democratic Republic, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Bulgaria, and Vietnam. The head of the German cooperative delegation and the Korean cooperative delegation attended today's congress, and other representatives are on their way to Beijing.

    Deng Zihui, representative of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Lin Boqu, representative of the Central People's Government, were warmly welcomed by all the delegates when they entered the venue. They successively delivered congratulatory speeches to the congress (full text to be published separately). In their congratulatory speeches, they both pointed out the important role of the cooperative economy in the entire national economy and the glorious tasks undertaken by the cooperatives during the transition period.

    Liu Zihjiu, Secretary of the Secretariat of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, congratulated the congress, and the executive chairman read out the congratulatory telegram from the All-China Democratic Women's Federation.

    Cheng Zihua, Acting Director of the Provisional Council, delivered the opening speech, saying that this congress is being held in the second year of planned large-scale economic construction, and it is an event of great significance in the historical process of China's cooperative movement. He said that the task of this congress is to examine and summarize the work of the cooperatives in the past few years in accordance with the requirements of the country's general task during the transition period, and on this basis, to determine the basic tasks of the supply and marketing cooperatives during the transition period. The congress will also formulate the Constitution of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives, elect members of the National Committee, members of the Council, and members of the Supervisory Committee, and formally establish the central leading organ and supervision organ of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives.

    Before the adjournment of the morning session, the congress approved the list of three committees: the Delegate Qualification Committee, the Proposal Review Committee, and the Document Drafting Committee.

    At the afternoon session, Cheng Zihua, on behalf of the Provisional Council, reported to the congress on the work of the past four years since the National Cooperative Workers' Representative Conference in July 1950 and the policies and tasks that should be adopted in the future.

    The report pointed out that in the past four years, supply and marketing cooperatives and consumer cooperatives have made great progress in terms of organization and business, which shows that this new type of trade network spread throughout the country has increasingly become an important component of our country's economy. It has not only played a significant role in the recovery and development of the national economy in recent years, especially in the recovery and development of agriculture, but also become a powerful assistant to state-owned commerce in stabilizing prices and developing the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, and also become an indispensable economic organization for the working people in supplying means of production and means of livelihood and reducing the exploitation of private merchants, but more importantly, it has consolidated and expanded the leading force of the socialist economy, reduced the position of capitalist commerce in the countryside, and promoted the development of mutual assistance and cooperation in the countryside, thereby helping to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance. The report also pointed out some shortcomings in the work of the past four years, which are mainly manifested in the insufficient and unforceful implementation of the policy that supply and marketing cooperatives must serve agricultural production; various levels of cooperatives have varying degrees of capitalist management thinking; the democratic management of cooperatives in many areas is still very poor, and political work is neglected.

    The report then put forward three basic tasks that supply and marketing cooperatives should implement during the transition period:

    First, through supply and marketing operations, carry out exchanges between urban and rural areas, serve agricultural production, in order to support national industrialization and consolidate the worker-peasant alliance;

    Second, according to national plans and price policies, through the contract system and planned supply and marketing operations, guide the small-peasant economy and individual handicraft industry to gradually incorporate into the track of national planning, and promote its socialist transformation;

    Third, under the leadership of the state-owned commercial leading organs, expand the organized circulation of commodities, lead the rural market, gradually realize the transformation of private merchants in the countryside, and replace the position of capitalist commerce in the countryside, and gradually cut off the connection between peasants and urban capitalism.

    The report pointed out that under the current circumstances, supply and marketing cooperatives must do a good job in planned procurement and planned supply entrusted by the state, and vigorously develop local sources of goods, further expand the circulation of commodities between urban and rural areas; strengthen the supply of means of agricultural production, carry out pre-purchase contracts and combined contracts, and promote the agricultural production increase movement centered on mutual assistance and cooperation; establish planned supply and marketing relations with the handicraft industry, increase the source of handicraft products, and promote the socialist transformation of the handicraft industry, etc.

    The report then put forward methods to improve business management and gradually implement the economic accounting system in the future. The report pointed out that the organizational form of local grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives should be appropriately adjusted according to the principle of taking into account both administrative divisions and economic divisions. The report emphasized that in order to make supply and marketing cooperatives a school for carrying out collectivist education for peasants, and to make members care about collective interests and actively participate in the management of cooperatives, it is necessary to strengthen the democratic management system. The report criticized the shortcomings of some cooperatives in this regard, pointing out that it is necessary to resolutely change the bad phenomena of not reporting work to the members' representative congress on schedule, not disclosing accounts, and not requiring the representative congress to approve business plans. The report finally pointed out that to achieve the basic tasks of supply and marketing cooperatives during the transition period, it is necessary to closely rely on the leadership of the Party, strengthen unity, and change the leadership style and work style.

    全国合作社代表大会开幕
    大会将确定合作社在过渡时期的基本任务
    【新华社二十日讯】中华全国合作社第一次代表大会二十日在北京开幕。到会代表共五百二十六名，代表着一亿六千四百多万名社员。
    会场布置的庄严美丽，会场悬挂的巨幅标语上写着中华全国合作社联合总社临时理事会向大会提出的供销合作社在过渡时期的三项基本任务。会场的走廊上挂满了全国各地合作社送给大会的贺幛和锦旗。会场进口处张挂的图表说明从一九五○年召开中华全国合作社工作者代表会议后四年以来，合作社获得了极大发展。一九五○年到一九五三年，社员由两千多万人增加到一亿六千多万人，零售额和收购额都增加了十倍以上，自有资金增加了十九倍半。由于全国供销合作社和农业生产的结合日益密切，一九五三年供应生产资料的数量等于一九五○年供应量的三十倍。合作社有十三万两千多个零售商店散布在全国各地，供销合作社占全国农村零售额的相当比重，发挥了它作为国营商业助手的作用。
    主席台上坐着由四十一人组成的主席团。主席团包括中华全国合作社联合总社临时理事会代主任程子华和临时监事会主任叶季壮，还有全国各地合作社工作者中的模范人物。江西省兴国县第四区官田乡乡长、合作社模范社员、农业生产互助组长萧美英（女）也参加了主席团。主席团中还包括藏族、维吾尔族、回族、蒙族、朝鲜族、苗族、僮族等七个少数民族的合作社代表。
    在京的临时理事会理事和监事会监事也出席了大会。
    大会邀请了苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟、蒙古人民共和国、德意志民主共和国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、越南等国家合作社的代表，德国合作社代表团团长和朝鲜合作社代表团参加了今天的大会，其他代表正在来京途中。
    中共中央代表邓子恢、中央人民政府代表林伯渠进入会场时，受到全体代表的热烈欢迎。他们相继向大会致祝词（全文另发）。在祝词中，他们都指出合作社经济在整个国民经济中的重要作用以及合作社在过渡时期所担负的光荣任务。
    中华全国总工会书记处书记刘子久向大会致贺，执行主席宣读了中华全国民主妇女联合会的贺电。
    临时理事会代主任程子华致开幕词，他说，这次大会在有计划的大规模的经济建设的第二年召开，它在中国合作社运动的历史进程中，是一个具有重大意义的事件。他说，这次大会的任务，就是要根据国家在过渡时期总任务的要求，检查和总结几年来合作社的工作，并在这个基础上，确定过渡时期供销合作社的基本任务。大会还要制订中华全国供销合作总社章程、选举全国委员会委员、理事会理事、监事会监事，正式成立中华全国供销合作社的中央领导机关和监察机关。
    在上午休会前，大会通过了代表资格、提案审查和文件起草三个委员会的名单。
    在下午的大会上，程子华代表临时理事会向大会作了一九五○年七月全国合作社工作者代表会议以来四年的工作和今后应当采取的方针任务的报告。
    报告指出，四年来供销合作社和消费合作社在组织上和业务上有了很大发展，这说明这一遍布全国各地的新型贸易网已日益成为我国经济的一个重要组成部分。它不仅对于几年来国民经济的恢复和发展，特别是对于农业的恢复和发展起了显著的作用，不仅在稳定物价和开展城乡物资交流中成为国营商业的有力助手，不仅在供应生产资料和生活资料、减少私商中间剥削上成为劳动人民不可缺少的经济组织，而更重要的是它巩固扩大了社会主义经济的领导力量，缩小了资本主义商业在农村的阵地，促进了农村互助合作的发展，从而有助于工农联盟的巩固。报告也指出了四年来工作中的一些缺点，这主要表现在贯彻执行供销合作社必须为农业生产服务的方针不够坚决有力；各级社存在着不同程度的资本主义经营思想；不少地区的合作社民主管理还很差以及忽视政治工作等。
    报告接着提出了供销合作社在过渡时期应该贯彻执行的三个基本任务：
    第一，通过供销业务，开展城乡交流，为农业生产服务，以支援国家工业化，并巩固工农联盟；
    第二，根据国家计划和价格政策，通过合同制度和有计划的供销业务，引导小农经济和个体手工业逐步纳入国家计划的轨道，并促进其社会主义改造；
    第三，在国营商业领导机关的领导下，扩大有组织的商品流转，领导农村市场，逐步实现对农村私商的改造，并代替资本主义商业在农村的阵地，逐步切断农民和城市资本主义的联系。
    报告指出，在目前情况下，供销合作社必须做好国家委托的计划收购和计划供应，并大力开展地方货源，进一步扩大城乡商品流转；加强农业生产资料的供应，开展预购合同和结合合同，促进以互助合作为中心的农业增产运动；和手工业建立有计划的供销关系，增加手工业品的货源，并促进对手工业的社会主义改造等。
    报告接着提出了今后改善经营管理，逐步推行经济核算制的办法。报告指出，各地基层供销合作社的组织形式应根据行政区划兼顾经济区划的原则适当加以调整。报告强调指出，要使供销合作社成为对农民进行集体主义教育的学校，要使社员关心集体利益，积极参加合作社的管理，必须加强民主管理制度。报告批评了有些合作社在这方面的缺点，指出必须坚决改变不按期向社员代表大会报告工作，不公开账目和不要求代表大会通过业务计划的不良现象。报告最后指出，实现供销合作社在过渡时期的基本任务，必须紧紧依靠党的领导，加强团结，转变领导作风和工作作风。
