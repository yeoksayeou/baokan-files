    法国各报对胡志明主席答记者问评论良好
    【新华社日内瓦十日电】所有法国报纸九日都刊载了越南民主共和国主席胡志明最近对越南通讯社主编所提问题的答复。巴黎的若干大报除报道这个消息，还对它作了良好的评论。
    “人道报”和“解放报”以第一页巨大的篇幅刊载了这篇答复。
    法新社报道：这篇答复“成了今晨这里外交人士的注意中心”。这个消息说：“据说在巴黎，没有一个人对胡志明所表示的和平意愿的诚意表示怀疑。”
      “费加罗报”指出：“巴黎外交界人士对胡志明的谈话表示注意和关切”，同时，“在日内瓦，接近亚洲会议各代表团的人士，也对越盟领袖的谈话表示关注”。
    “战斗报”写道：“可以把这篇答复的内容作这样的总结：如果法国真心诚意地希望和平，那么是能够重建和平的。”这个报纸认为，这篇答复是“进行谈判的一个请帖”。
    “人道报”在评论胡志明主席对中印两国总理联合声明和中缅两国总理联合声明中的五项原则所持的态度时，在社论中写道：“胡志明主席声明了——正如他刚做的那样——这些原则也适用于印度支那问题，因此他一定得到亚洲广大多数人民的无保留的支持。”
    “战斗报”指出：胡志明主席在他的答复中“对美国的亚洲政策的谴责，也有助于停火的实现”。
