Mutual aid and cooperative organizations in various parts of Jiangsu Province have achieved further development and consolidation through the summer harvest and planting season. According to statistics from the Huaiyin Special District, the number of mutual aid teams in the entire district has increased from 50,700 during the spring plowing season to over 59,000. Existing mutual aid teams have also absorbed a large number of individual farmers. In the Songjiang Special District, through the spring and summer production seasons, the number of farm households participating in mutual aid and cooperative organizations has increased from 53% of the households that should be organized to 62%, with more than 46,000 individual farmers newly joining mutual aid teams. Most other areas have also seen an increase of about 10%.

In addition, many areas have widely promoted the organization of mutual aid and cooperation networks, or established regular contact systems between agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams, centered on agricultural production cooperatives, to exchange work experience and production technology. Kunshan County established 65 mutual aid and cooperation networks with agricultural cooperatives or good mutual aid teams as the core, helping the surrounding mutual aid teams solve problems such as work evaluation and record-keeping, and production planning. Chuansha County's 31 agricultural cooperatives directly assisted in the reorganization of 108 mutual aid teams. Lianshui County also used the mutual aid team leader meeting system to leverage 117 good year-round teams to drive 674 general teams through the meeting system.

Through this series of measures, the mutual aid teams in various places have fundamentally changed the past phenomenon of "organizing in spring and collapsing in summer" and formalism, and the number of year-round teams has also increased significantly. The Songjiang Special District originally had only more than 7,400 year-round teams, but now it has grown to more than 13,000. In Gaoyou County, 1,360 temporary teams have been upgraded to year-round teams through the summer harvest and planting season. In Taicang County, 400 mutual aid teams are actively creating conditions to prepare for establishing cooperatives after the autumn harvest.

Currently, all localities are generally summarizing the summer harvest and planting work, doing a good job in clearing work and settling accounts, further implementing the general task education, reversing the lax mood of some mutual aid teams that believe the busy season is over, and planning summer weeding and hoeing, and mid-cultivation and weeding, to strive for a bumper autumn harvest.

    江苏省各地互助合作组织有进一步的发展
    江苏省各地互助合作组织通过夏收夏种有了进一步的发展和巩固。据淮阴专区统计，全区互助组已由春耕生产时的五万零七百个，发展到五万九千多个，原有的互助组也吸收了大量的单干农民参加。松江专区通过春夏两季的生产，参加互助合作组织的农户亦已由原来的占应组织农户的百分之五十三发展到百分之六十二，有四万六千多户单干农民新参加了互助组。一般地区也都比原来增加了百分之十左右。
    此外，不少地区大量推广了互助合作网的组织，或以农业生产合作社为中心与互助组建立了经常的联系制度，交流工作经验和生产技术。昆山县以农业社或好的互助组为核心成立了六十五处互助合作网，帮助周围互助组解决了评工记分和生产计划等问题。川沙县三十一个农业社直接帮助整理了一百零八个互助组。涟水县并运用互助组长接头会制度，以一百十七个好的常年组通过接头会带动了六百七十四个一般组。
    通过这一系列的办法，各地的互助组基本上改变了过去“春组织，夏垮台”和形式主义的现象，而且常年组也有了显著增加。松江专区原来只有七千四百多个常年组，现在已发展到一万三千多个。高邮县通过夏收夏种已有一千三百六十个临时组提高到常年组。太仓县有四百个互助组积极地创造条件，准备秋后办社。
    目前各地一般都在通过总结夏收夏种工作，做好清工结账，进一步地贯彻总任务教育，扭转部分互助组认为大忙已过的松劲情绪，计划夏季耘耥和中耕除草等工作，争取秋熟丰收。
