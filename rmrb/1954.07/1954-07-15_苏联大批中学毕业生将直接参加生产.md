Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 11th: After completing their examinations, many secondary school graduates throughout the Soviet Union are beginning to take up positions in industrial and agricultural production. This year, the number of secondary school graduates in the Soviet Union is nearly 470,000, almost double the number from last year. This year, Moscow's secondary schools have nearly 43,000 graduates, more than 4,300 of whom have received gold and silver medals for excellent academic performance. Among the graduating high school students, a large number will directly enter industrial and agricultural production departments to participate in labor and work. A portion of the students will go on to universities. Another portion will enter various secondary specialized schools to learn intermediate technical skills. Vilichenko, a graduate of the Rodinkov Secondary School in the Krasnodar Krai, has decided to return to his "Revolutionary Lighthouse" collective farm. He said: "I don't yet know exactly what work I will be doing. But I am determined to stay and work on my own farm." Sazonov, a graduate of Glotov Secondary School, has decided to go to a machine tractor station to become a tractor driver. Kolmishkina and Bocharov, tenth-grade graduates of this school, have decided to stay on the farm to participate in labor. They are all determined to become skilled workers and experts in achieving bumper harvests. This year, nearly 2,000 middle school students will graduate in Ivanovo, and many students will go to work in textile factories and sewing factories. To help the newly employed students become familiar with the work, these enterprises have organized three-month training courses for them. Currently, about 700 students are studying in these training courses.

    【新华社莫斯科十一日电】苏联各地中等学校已经考试完毕，许多中学毕业生正开始走上工农业生产岗位。苏联今年中等学校的毕业生差不多达到四十七万人，几乎比去年增加一倍。莫斯科各中等学校今年共有将近四万三千人毕业，其中四千三百多人因成绩优良获得了金质和银质奖章。在毕业的中学生中，有大批学生将直接进入工农业生产部门参加劳动和工作。一部分学生将进高等学校读书。另一部分学生将进各种中等专科学校学习中等技术技能。克拉斯诺达边疆区罗金科夫中学的毕业生维利钦科已决定回到自己的“革命灯塔”集体农庄去。他说：我现在还不确切知道我将作什么工作。但我坚决地决定留在自己的农庄上工作。格洛托夫中学毕业生萨佐诺夫决定到机器拖拉机站做拖拉机手。这个学校的十年级毕业生科尔米什金娜和波查罗夫决定留在农庄上参加劳动。他们都决心使自己成为有技术的工人和丰收的能手。伊凡诺佛今年有将近两千名中学生毕业，许多学生将到纺织工厂、缝纫工厂去工作。为了帮助新参加工作的学生们熟悉工作，这些企业都为他们组织了为期三月的训练班。现在已有约七百名学生在这些训练班里学习。
