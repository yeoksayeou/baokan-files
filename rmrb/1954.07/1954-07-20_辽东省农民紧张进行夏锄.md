Farmers in various counties of Liaodong Province are seizing the time to carry out summer weeding and soil loosening for field crops. The second round of soil loosening in the southern and central regions has now been completed. The third round of soil loosening has reached 40% to 60% of the cultivated land area. In the northern regions (Hailong, Tonghua, Xifeng, and other counties), where the climate is cooler, 40% to 80% of the fields have been weeded and loosened twice. Farmers in the southern and central counties are now beginning to apply fertilizer to promote the rapid growth of seedlings that have been developing slowly due to excessive rain. The first application of fertilizer to 36,000 mu of corn in Andong County has now been completed; one-third of the 100,000 mu of various rationally densely planted crops have been fertilized, and the process is continuing; Liaoyang, Gaiping, and other counties are also loosening soil and applying fertilizer simultaneously.

Currently, corn and millet in the southern and central regions have grown to be more than two chi (approximately 66cm) tall, sorghum is one chi three or four cun (approximately 43-46cm) tall, and wheat is in the grain-filling stage and will be harvested in half a month.

    辽东省农民紧张进行夏锄
    辽东省各县农民正抓紧进行大田作物的夏锄铲?。现在南部和中部地区二遍铲?全部结束。三遍铲?已达到耕地面积百分之四十到六十，在气候较凉的北部地区（海龙、通化、西丰等县）也有百分之四十到八十的大田铲?了二遍。现在在南部和中部各县的农民正开始追肥，以促进因雨多而发育迟缓的禾苗迅速成长。安东县三万六千亩玉米第一次追肥现已结束；十万亩合理密植的各种作物有三分之一施完了追肥，现正在继续进行；辽阳、盖平等县也边铲?边追肥。
    现南部和中部地区苞米谷子已长有二尺多高，高粱也有一尺三、四寸，小麦已灌浆，半月后即可收割。
