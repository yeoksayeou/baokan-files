Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Steelmaking Plant, Seamless Steel Tube Plant, Medium Rolling Mill, Small Rolling Mill, Welded Steel Tube Plant, and the company's directly affiliated Tool Workshop, among other units, have completed their first-half national production plans six to thirty-three days ahead of schedule.

This half-year, the steel production of the Steelmaking Plant has far exceeded the entire year's output in 1950 and is close to the entire year's output in 1951. However, the scrap steel and molten iron used per ton of steel produced have been greatly reduced. Comparing the first quarter of last year with the first quarter of this year, the consumption of steel materials per ton of steel produced has been reduced by dozens of kilograms. After the implementation of the fixed-material steelmaking system, the consumption of steel materials decreased very significantly in the second half of last year, and this year the average for the first five months decreased by another five kilograms compared to December of last year. In the first half of this year, the workers of the Seamless Steel Tube Plant produced hundreds of types of seamless steel tubes with different diameters and wall thicknesses for the country. On May 24, they successfully trial-rolled a seamless steel tube with a diameter larger than specified in the technical design. These products strongly supported China's petroleum industry, boiler manufacturing plants, and large-scale geological exploration work.

The workers of the Steelmaking Plant have further studied advanced Soviet experience and implemented the suggestions of Soviet experts. In terms of rapid steelmaking, workers promoted new furnace repair methods and used furnace repair machines, reducing furnace repair time by one-fifth. They also implemented the rapid ingot casting method, reducing the time for casting each killed steel ingot by an average of two-fifths compared to last year. In addition, they learned new charging methods and the experience of rapid turnover in the pit, which created conditions for rapid steelmaking. In the past six months, the workers of the Steelmaking Plant have put forward more than one hundred rationalization proposals. Workers Sun Dongping and Lai Mingliang improved the bricklaying method of the open hearth steel outlet trough, saving hundreds of millions of yuan worth of refractory bricks. Under the leadership of steelmaking workers Li ShaoKui, Wang ShouWen and Wang EnXin, the workers of No. 8 open hearth furnace conscientiously studied advanced Soviet experience and over-fulfilled the production plan by several thousand tons of steel. The workers of the tool workshop where advanced producer Wang Chonglun works actively participated in the technical innovation movement, improved production efficiency, and completed the first half-year production task 33 days ahead of schedule. Li Shixing in this workshop improved the multi-blade cutter bar, and Wang Guozhu improved the jaw planer, both of which doubled production efficiency. (Xinhua News Agency)

Shaanxi Province's Yanchang Oil Mine has overfulfilled this year's first-half crude oil production plan one month and four days ahead of schedule.

The mine's technical management has improved significantly in the past six months. A chief engineer's office was established, and technical groups and designated technical cadres were established in each workshop. A series of technical responsibility systems were also established. In the first quarter, the mine's employees put forward a total of 105 rationalization proposals, and in April, they put forward another 83 proposals, thus continuously improving production efficiency. For example, after the suggestion of modifying the screw cap tool proposed by Wu Huang, Du Fangxiao, and Liang Peirong of the repair workshop was implemented, the work efficiency increased by more than nine times. Driver Xiong Bin proposed installing a brake sub-pump on the rear tires of the car, which can prevent breaking the rear axle and causing the danger of overturning.

In particular, in the first half of this year, due to the implementation of the suggestions of Soviet experts, work efficiency was greatly improved, ensuring the early completion of the production task. For example, the Yongping oil production workshop implemented the expert's suggestion of increasing production by explosion, and the output of some wells increased by 85 times. The implementation of the expert's suggestion of washing wells with hot salt water increased the output of some wells by 38 times.

By June 23, the state-owned Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant had completed the first half of the year's national output plans ahead of schedule for ten major products: pig iron, open-hearth steel, electric furnace steel, forged steel, steel, sheet metal, metallurgical coke, refractory bricks, and cold-cast rolls. According to the plant's statistics on the 24th, sheet metal has completed 70.51 percent of the annual output plan; cold-cast rolls have completed 81.03 percent; electric furnace steel, pig iron, and refractory bricks have all completed more than 56 percent. The quality of the ten major products, except for June which has not yet been statistically analyzed, exceeded the planned targets from January to May.

In the first half of this year, all employees of the plant vigorously implemented the suggestions of Soviet experts. After a certain blast furnace in the Ironmaking Department implemented advanced experience such as the "furnace top adjustment method," the effective volume of the furnace used to produce one ton of iron decreased from more than one cubic meter in the past to 0.878 cubic meters in May. The electric furnaces in the Electric Furnace Steelmaking Department also created new records for shortening smelting time twice on June 4 and 5 since the furnace was built.

Before and after the successful completion of the first half of the year's plan, Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant has been actively preparing for the second half of the year's production. The July operating plan was issued to all departments on the 23rd. After June 15, the plant's production section and relevant departments jointly studied the raw material balance problem for the second half of the year, formally determined the maintenance plan for July, and prepared the operating plan for important and urgent spare parts. At the same time, in order to ensure the safe operation of employees in the hot summer, all departments are carrying out various specific measures to prevent heatstroke. (Xinhua News Agency)

    鞍钢一部分工厂和延长油矿
    提前完成上半年国家生产计划
    太原钢铁厂十项主要产品上半年计划提前完成
    鞍山钢铁公司已有炼钢厂、无缝钢管厂、中型轧钢厂、小型轧钢厂、焊接钢管厂和公司直属的工具车间等单位提前六天到三十三天完成了上半年的国家生产计划。
    这半年中，炼钢厂生产的钢已远超过一九五零年全年的产量，接近一九五一年全年的产量，可是每炼一吨钢所用的废钢和铁水却大大降低了。如果拿去年第一季度和今年第一季度比较，每炼一吨钢所消耗的钢铁料已节约了几十公斤。推行定料炼钢制以后，去年下半年钢铁料的消耗有非常显著的降低，今年头五个月平均又比去年十二月份降低了五公斤。无缝钢管厂的职工，今年上半年为国家生产了几百种口径大小不同和管壁厚薄不同的无缝钢管，五月二十四日并试轧成功一种比技术设计规定的口径还要大的无缝钢管。这些产品有力地支援了我国石油工业、锅炉制造厂和大规模的地质勘探工作。
    炼钢厂的职工进一步学习了苏联先进经验和贯彻实行了苏联专家的建议。在快速炼钢方面，职工们推行了新的补炉方法和使用了补炉机，使补炉时间减少五分之一；贯彻实行了快速铸锭法，使每铸一个镇静钢锭的时间也比去年平均缩短了五分之二。此外他们并学习了新的装料方法和地坑快速周转等经验，这样就为快速炼钢创造了条件。半年来，炼钢厂工人共提出了一百多件合理化建议。工人孙东平、来明良改进了平炉出钢槽的砌砖方法，节省了价值几亿元的耐火砖。在炼钢工人李绍奎、王守文、王恩信的带领下，八号平炉的工人认真学习了苏联先进经验，超计划生产了几千吨的钢。先进生产者王崇伦所在的工具车间的职工，积极参加技术革新运动，提高了生产效率，提前三十三天完成了上半年的生产任务。这个车间的李世兴改进了多刀多刃刀杆，王国柱改进了钳口刨刀，都使生产效率提高了两倍。（新华社）

    陕西省延长油矿已提前一个月零四天超额完成了今年上半年的原油生产计划。
    该矿半年来的技术管理工作已有了显著的改进，矿上成立了总工程师室，各车间建立了技术组和确定了技术专责干部，并建立了一系列的技术专责制度。第一季度该矿职工共提出合理化建议一○五件，四月份又提出八十三件，因而使生产效率不断地得到提高。如修理车间吴璜、杜芳孝和梁培荣三人提出改制螺丝帽工具的建议实现后，使工作效率提高九倍以上；司机熊斌提出了在汽车后轮胎上装刹车分泵，可以防止折断后轴和引起翻车的危险。
    特别是该矿上半年内由于执行了苏联专家的建议，因而大大地提高了工作效率，保证了生产任务的提前完成；如永坪采油车间，执行了专家关于爆炸增产的建议，有的井产量提高了八十五倍；执行了专家关于热盐水洗井的建议，有的井产量提高了三十八倍。

    到六月二十三日止，国营太原钢铁厂的生铁、平炉钢、电炉钢、锻钢、钢材、薄板、冶金焦、耐火砖、冷铸轧辊等十项主要产品都提前完成了上半年的国家产量计划。根据这个厂二十四日的统计，薄板已完成全年产量计划百分之七十点五一；冷铸轧辊完成百分之八十一点零三；电炉钢、生铁和耐火砖都完成百分之五十六以上。十项主要产品质量除六月份尚未统计出来外，一月份到五月份都超额完成了计划指标。
    今年上半年，全厂职工大力贯彻苏联专家建议。炼铁部某号高炉推行“炉顶调剂法”等先进经验后，每生产一吨铁由过去占高炉有效容积一立方公尺以上，降低到五月份的零点八七八立方公尺。电炉炼钢部电炉也在六月四日和五日创造了建炉以来两次缩短冶炼时间的新纪录。
    在胜利完成上半年计划的前后，太原钢铁厂已在积极进行下半年的生产准备工作。七月份的作业计划在二十三日就下达到各部了。六月十五日以后，这个厂的生产科和有关部门共同研究了下半年的原材料平衡问题，正式确定了七月份的检修计划，并编制出重要和紧急备件的作业计划。同时各部为保证职工在炎热的夏季能安全操作，正进行防暑的各种具体措施。（新华社）
