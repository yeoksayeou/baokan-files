    We are the First Batch of Foundry Workers Trained by New China
    Liao Xinyao, a graduate of the Foundry Specialization Program, Huazhong Institute of Technology
    We are graduating and will soon be taking on glorious positions in the construction of our motherland, participating in the construction of the First Five-Year Plan, and we are all immensely happy.
    We study foundry engineering. In the past, Old China couldn't manufacture its own machines and could only repair some parts, so there was no such major in higher education institutions. After liberation, with the development of our motherland's construction, our school established the Foundry Specialization Program. We are the first batch of students in this specialization program and also the first batch of foundry engineering graduates in New China.
    "Everything is hard in the beginning." In the two years of our studies, we went through a winding road. I remember when we first entered the school, we didn't know what foundry work was all about. When we visited the school's practice factory, the heat engineering room, the electrical laboratory, the materials testing laboratory, the wood pattern shop, the lathe shop, the fitter shop... all had various kinds of machines, and even the forging shop had an electric spring hammer. Only the foundry shop was filled with piles of sand and broken iron boxes, and the only thing that caught the eye was a three-way furnace modified from a gasoline drum. "What is there to learn in foundry work?" "Can there be knowledge in mud and sand?" A series of questions arose in our minds. Most of the students in our class were cadres transferred from the army and government organizations, and most were members of the Communist Youth League. They understood the importance of obeying the organization, so no one proposed changing their major. However, the simple task-oriented view of "I'll study if I'm told to" and the "wait and see" attitude were widespread.
    Things often happen like this: from unfamiliarity to familiarity, and from familiarity to affection. When we were studying general engineering foundation courses, we had to go to the electrical laboratory and various workshops for practice every week. During practice, we had to touch the machines. Each time, the practice instructor would introduce the structure and performance of the machines, and often point out the origin of various parts: this is cast iron, this is cast steel, this is non-ferrous alloy casting... Therefore, during the practice, we gradually realized the importance of foundry work. But what to learn and how to learn, we still didn't know. When the specialized courses began, when the teacher first walked into the classroom, some students even had this feeling: mud and sand are so simple, what can you teach! It wasn't until we heard a lot of things we had never heard before, and knew that there were many things to learn, that we realized our thinking was completely wrong. For example, simply studying the physical properties of sand can produce dozens of geometric curves; to study the heat resistance of sand when metal solution is injected, we must analyze the chemical composition of the sand. Especially in melting, it involves specialized scientific theories such as metallurgy principles, physical chemistry, fluid mechanics, and metallographic structure. Therefore, what is in front of us is not "simple" but complicated and difficult, not "no knowledge" but profound knowledge. At this time, everyone changed their previous views and made up their minds to delve into it. The school also held many meetings to study our major direction, adding a lot of machines, such as molding machines, sand mills, sand sifters, sand mixers, tumbling machines, etc., and also bought a set of molding sand analysis instruments, gradually mechanizing the original manual workshop. Under the guidance of the teachers, we transformed the three-way furnace into a small cupola with a row of tuyeres. With the conditions to delve into it, coupled with the determination of the students, we became fond of it as we delved deeper. Especially through the two factory internships and the study of the General Line, we loved our major even more. Our first internship was in a locomotive and rolling stock repair factory, and our second internship was in a textile machinery factory. Whenever the cupola was blowing air, we saw the dazzling white molten iron flowing out, which would be cast into a part on a train. At this time, we thought: the train flows like blood in the arteries of the motherland, sending people from Nanjing to Beijing, industrial products to the countryside, and agricultural products to the city. When it is cast into a part and installed on a textile machine, we thought: it will weave all kinds of floral fabrics, warming the people who had no clothes to wear in the past, decorating every young girl, and making the elderly look young too. When we studied "national industrialization" in the General Line, we thought about how many machines were needed for the countless newly built factories in our motherland! When we studied "agricultural collectivization," we thought about the tractors needed in the vast fields of our motherland waiting for us to manufacture. We deeply realized the glory and greatness of the future tasks, the importance of foundry engineering, and we were proud to study this major!
    Although we have only studied for two years, we have learned everything we need to learn. We have a preliminary understanding of the theory and operation of cast iron, cast steel, and cast non-ferrous metals, learned the basic movements of molding, we can analyze the composition of cast iron, identify the metallographic structure of steel, and can batch and melt ductile iron, etc. During last year's internship, we worked with master craftsmen, and most of the things we made met the specifications. We have completed the learning tasks assigned to us by the motherland.
    However, this has been through a difficult process and hard work. Lacking teachers, the school had to repeatedly ask fraternal colleges for help; without textbooks, teachers and students were very anxious, often going to bookstores to inquire about news, almost buying all the books related to foundry work. Once, we heard that a factory had a complete set of materials on foundry work, so we asked the school to issue a letter of introduction and finally borrowed it. The factory only allowed us to borrow it for five days. The entire set of materials consisted of twelve books, sixteen-open size, more than three hundred pages. It was impossible to read aloud to the entire class page by page, let alone some charts and graphs could not be read, and it was even more impossible to see them by passing them around. So we distributed the materials and mobilized all the students in the class to copy them, and finally obtained this material. When the molding sand analysis instrument ordered by the school did not know the delivery date, we borrowed a set from a nearby factory. In short, whatever we need for our studies, no matter what the difficulties, we always try our best to get it. However, we do not grab blindly, we study with a plan and step by step. Each person formulates a plan every week according to their own situation, and there is also a progress schedule every day. The teachers were moved by our spirit of learning. One professor said: "This class of students (referring to us), the level was uneven at the beginning, and my teaching confidence was not high; however, strangely, everyone quickly caught up and delved into it, making my lectures more and more energetic. I don't feel tired even after lecturing for three consecutive sessions, and I still feel that I haven't lectured enough and want to lecture more." In this way, under the leadership of the Party and the school administration, and under the guidance of the teachers, we have obtained the knowledge we deserve.
    Now, we have graduated, and we will accept the tasks assigned to us by the motherland. But to measure our learning by the work that the motherland is about to hand over to us, we cannot say that we have graduated, but that we are starting a new learning; we are not leaving the school, but entering a larger university that combines theory and practice to learn. In several internships, we understand: we have no reason to be satisfied with what we have learned in school, we should humbly learn from the masses, and strive to realize the First Five-Year Plan of the motherland and the general task of the transition period of the country. Whether it is in the south or the north, whether it is a large factory or a small factory, wherever the motherland assigns us, we will take root there and release the flames of our youth there!

    我们是新中国培养的第一批铸造工作者
    华中工学院铸工专修科本届毕业生　廖新曜
    毕业了，马上就要走上建设祖国的光荣岗位，而且是参加第一个五年计划的建设工作，我们都感到无限高兴。
    我们是学铸造工程的。过去旧中国自己不会制造机器，只能修配一些零件，所以在高等学校里没有这个专业的设置。解放后，随着祖国建设事业的发展，我们学校才成立了铸工专修科。我们就是这个专修科的第一批学生，也是新中国的第一批铸造工程毕业生。
    “万事起头难”，在两年的学习中，我们是经过了一段弯曲的道路的。记得我们刚入学的时候，大家都不知道铸工是怎么一回事；到学校实习工厂去参观，热工室、电机实验室、材料试验室、木模间、车工间、钳工间……都有各种各样的机器，连锻工间也有一座电动的弹簧锤，只有铸工间，堆着一屋子的砂泥和破破烂烂的铁箱子，比较引人注目的也只是一个汽油桶改装的三接炉。“铸工有什么可学的呢？”“泥巴砂子中能有学问吗？”于是在我们的思想上产生了一连串的问题。我们班的同学，大多数是从部队和机关调出的干部，大多数是青年团员，对服从组织这一点是明白的，因此还没有人提出转系的问题来。但是“要我学就学吧”的单纯任务观点和“学着瞧”的思想是普遍存在的。
    事情的经过往往是这样的，由陌生到熟悉，由熟悉到发生感情。在我们学习一般工程基础课程的时候，每星期都要到电机实验室和各个车间去实习，实习就要摸机器，每次摸机器，实习指导人都向我们介绍机器的构造和性能，并且常常指出各个零件的来历：这是铸铁的，这是铸钢的，这是有色合金铸造的……因此在实习中，我们逐渐认识到铸工的重要性了。不过学些什么，怎样去学，我们还不知道。当专业课开始的时候，老师第一次走进教室，甚至还有的同学怀着这样的心情：泥巴砂子这样简单，看你讲啥！直至我们听到很多从来没有听过的东西，知道还有很多东西要学时，才知道自己的想法完全错了。譬如单纯研究砂子的物理性能，就能作出几十条几何曲线；要研究砂泥对金属溶液注入时的耐热性，就要分析砂泥的化学成分。尤其是熔化方面，要涉及冶金原理、物理化学、流体力学、金相组织等专门科学理论，因此摆在我们面前的不是“简单”而是繁难，不是“无学问”而是有高深的学问。这时，大家便改变了以前的观点，下决心要钻进去。学校为我们的专业方向也曾多次开会研究，添置了很多机器，如造型机、碾砂机、筛砂机、拌砂机、滚筒机等，还买了一套型砂分析仪器，把原始手工作业的车间逐渐机械化了；在老师的指导下，我们把三接炉改成一个小小的一排风口的冲天炉了。有了钻的条件，加上同学们的决心，一钻就钻出感情了。尤其是通过两次工厂实习和总路线的学习，我们更热爱我们的专业了。我们的实习，第一次是在一个机车车辆修理工厂，第二次是在一个纺织机械工厂。每当冲天炉鼓风的时候，我们看到，白得耀眼的铁水流出来了，它将铸成一个火车上的零件。这时我们想到：火车像血液样的在祖国的动脉中流动着，把南京的人送到北京，把工业产品送到农村，把农业产品送到城市。当它铸成一个零件装在纺织机上的时候，我们想到：它将织出各种各样的花布，温暖着过去没有衣服穿的人们，装饰着每一个年轻的姑娘，使老年人也打扮得年轻。当我们学习总路线学到“国家工业化”的时候，我们想祖国无数新建起来的工厂需要多少机器啊！学到“农业集体化”的时候，我们就想到祖国广阔的田野上需用的拖拉机等待我们去制造。我们深深地体会到未来任务的光荣和伟大、铸造工程的重要，我们为学习这一专业而自豪！
    我们虽然只学得两年，但是，要学的都学了。我们初步了解了铸铁、铸钢、铸有色金属的理论和操作，学会了造型的基本动作，我们能够分析铸铁的成分，辨别钢铁的金相组织，能够配料和熔制球墨铸铁等。去年实习中，我们跟老师傅一起干活，我们做出来的东西绝大部分都合规格。我们完成了祖国交给的学习任务。
    然而，这是经过了艰苦的过程和辛勤的劳动的。缺乏教师，学校里不得不再三再四地到兄弟学院去请；没有教材，教师和同学都很着急，经常到书店里去打听消息，差不多把所有有关铸工方面的书籍都买全了。有一次，我们听说某工厂有一份完整的关于铸工方面的资料，我们便找学校开介绍信，终于把它借来了。工厂只允许我们借五天，全部资料有十二本，十六开大小，三百多页，一页页向全班念都念不完，何况有些图表不能念，传着看更看不完了，于是我们把资料分散开来，发动全班同学抄写，终于获得了这份资料。当学校定购的型砂分析仪器还不知道交货的日期时，我们向附近的工厂里借了一套。总之，凡是我们学习上需要的，不管任何困难，我们总想尽办法把它争取到手；然而我们并不瞎抓，我们是有计划有步骤地学习，各人根据各人的情况，每周都订出计划，每日还有进度表。教师们为我们这种学习精神所感动，一位教授说：“这班学生（指我们），开始时程度不齐，我的教学信心也不大；然而很奇怪，大家很快就赶上了，而且钻进去了，使我讲课越讲越有劲，连讲三节课也不累，还觉得讲的不够，还想多讲一点。”就是这样，在党和学校行政的领导下，在教师们的教导下，我们获得了应有的知识。
    现在，我们毕业了，我们将接受祖国所分配给我们的任务，但拿祖国将要交给我们的工作来衡量我们的学习，我们不能说是毕业，而是开始新的学习；我们不是离开学校，而是进入一个更大的理论和实践结合的大学里去学习。在几次的实习中，我们懂得：我们毫没有理由满足于在学校里学到的东西，我们应该虚心向群众学习，为实现祖国的第一个五年计划，为国家过渡时期的总任务而奋斗。不管是南方北方，不管是大工厂小工厂，祖国把我们分配在那里，就在那里生根，就在那里放出青春的火焰！
