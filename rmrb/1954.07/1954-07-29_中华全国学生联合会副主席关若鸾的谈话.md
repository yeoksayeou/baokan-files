The All-China Students' Federation Vice Chairman Guan Ruoluan said:
Chinese students warmly welcome the Geneva Conference agreement on the issues of ceasefire and political matters in Indochina. We are happy for the glorious peaceful life achieved by the people of Indochina, and we are delighted that students in Indochina will no longer suffer the threat of artillery fire and can study and grow up in a peaceful environment.
Chinese students completely agree with and fully support the various agreements reached at the Geneva Conference regarding the issue of peace in Indochina. We have always been concerned about and supported the just struggle of the people and young students of Indochina. We will certainly continue to work with young students in Indochina and around the world to oppose the U.S. imperialism's organization of the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc, to strive for the thorough implementation of the Geneva Conference agreements, and to defend peace in Asia and the world.
