Introduction to the Twenty-Sixth Issue of the Chinese Edition of "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!"

    The Chinese edition of the twenty-sixth issue, 1954, of the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties organ, "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" has been published.

    In the editorial entitled "The Indissoluble Fraternal Friendship Between the Countries of the Socialist Camp" in this issue, it is pointed out that the countries of the powerful socialist camp have established a new type of relationship, namely, fraternal friendship, trust, and regular mutual assistance. The characteristic of this relationship is full respect for the sovereignty and independence of all countries, large and small, which is fundamentally different from the relationship between countries in the capitalist camp, namely, the strong enslaving the weak and infringing upon national sovereignty. The friendship between the countries of the socialist camp is the greatest achievement of the people of all countries. This friendship guarantees that these countries are politically, technically, and economically independent of the capitalist world, and provides the necessary conditions for the continuous development of their economies and cultures. This friendship is a reliable guarantee of the sovereignty of these countries and a pillar of world peace. The editorial emphasizes that the unbreakable friendship between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China consolidates the peace and democracy camp and has a huge impact on the entire international situation. The people of the countries of the democratic camp, which has one-third of the world's population, are vigilantly defending peace. They have formed an unbreakable friendship, and they will at any time inflict a devastating blow on any aggressor who dares to infringe upon their victorious achievements.

    This issue contains excerpts of the report by Viliam Široký, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, at the Tenth Congress of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia. Important articles published in this issue include: "No, the Era of Sovereign States Has Not Passed!" by Georges Cogniot, member of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, and "The Communist Party of Israel Fights for Peace and National Independence" by Shmuel Mikunis, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Israel.

    Cogniot's article points out that all parties and politicians in Western European capitalist countries who defend the interests of reactionaries are doubling their efforts to try to convince public opinion that it is necessary to eliminate the sovereignty of national states. But in fact, never in human history has there been such a powerful movement against national oppression and for the sovereignty of the people of Asian, African, and Latin American countries as there is today. More than one billion people, that is, three-quarters of the population of the capitalist world, have participated in this struggle for independence and for the establishment of free countries. In the face of the national liberation movement, the imperialists are weak and powerless. For all the people in those colonies and dependent countries who no longer want to live the way they are currently living, and for the vast masses who have recently broken free from the shackles of imperialism, or are striving to liberate themselves from these shackles, the era of sovereign states has not only not passed, but has only just begun.

    Mikunis's article summarizes the situation in which Israel is politically and economically dependent on American imperialism, the masses of the people are subjected to double exploitation and oppression, and the masses of the people are launching struggles because they hate the enslavement policy of American monopoly capital. The article emphasizes that the Communist Party of Israel opposes the imperialists inciting hatred among all nationalities. It stands at the forefront of the struggle against the enslavement of Israel by American imperialists and for national independence and peace. It is not afraid of any difficulties and tirelessly continues to fight for the united action of the working class; it is stepping up the struggle to establish a broad patriotic people's front against the anti-people government and its American protectors, and to establish a government that defends peace and national independence.

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版二十六期内容介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”一九五四年第二十六期中文版已经出版。
    本期在题为“社会主义阵营各国间的牢不可破的兄弟友谊”的社论中指出：强大的社会主义阵营各国已经建立了一种新型的关系，即兄弟般的友好、信任和经常互助的关系。这种关系的特点是充分尊重大小国家的主权和独立，和资本主义阵营国家之间的关系，即强者奴役弱者和侵犯国家主权的关系是根本不同的。社会主义阵营国家之间的友谊是各国人民最伟大的成就。这种友谊保证了这些国家在政治上、技术上和经济上不依赖资本主义世界，并为本国经济和文化的不断发展提供了必要的条件。这种友谊是这些国家的主权的可靠的保障，是世界和平的支柱。社论着重说：苏联和中华人民共和国牢不可破的友谊巩固着和平民主阵营，对于整个国际形势发生着巨大的影响。拥有世界人口三分之一的民主阵营的各国人民警惕地保卫着和平。他们已经结成牢不可破的友谊，他们将随时给予任何胆敢侵犯他们的胜利果实的侵略者以毁灭性打击。
    本期摘要刊载了捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央政治局委员威廉·西罗基在捷共第十次代表大会上的报告。本期刊载的重要文章有：法国共产党中央委员乔治·谷尼欧的“不，主权国家的时代并没有过去！”，以色列共产党总书记萨·米库尼斯的“以色列共产党为和平和民族独立而斗争”。
    谷尼欧的文章指出：西欧资本主义国家所有维护反动派利益的政党和政客都在加倍卖力地企图使舆论界相信有必要消灭民族国家的主权。但是事实上，人类历史上还从来没有过今天这样强大的反对民族压迫，争取亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民的主权的运动。十亿以上的群众，即资本主义世界人口的四分之三，参加了这一争取独立、争取成立自由国家的斗争。在民族解放运动面前，帝国主义者是软弱无力的。对于那些再也不愿意过目前这种生活的所有殖民地和附属国的人民来说，对于最近已经挣脱了帝国主义枷锁，或正在争取把自己从这枷锁解放出来的广大群众来说，主权国家的时代非但没有过去，而且还只是刚刚开始。
    米库尼斯的文章综述了以色列在政治上和经济上依附美国帝国主义、人民群众受到双重的剥削和压迫的情形，和人民群众由于痛恨美国垄断资本的奴役政策而展开斗争的情形。文章着重说，以色列共产党反对帝国主义者在各族人民中间煽起仇恨。它站在反对美国帝国主义者奴役以色列和争取民族独立与和平的斗争的前列。它不怕任何困难，不疲倦地继续为工人阶级的战斗的统一行动而斗争；它正在加紧斗争，争取建立一个广泛的爱国人民阵线，反对反人民的政府及其美国保护者，并争取建立一个维护和平和民族独立的政府。（新华社）
