Higher Industrial Schools in East China
This Summer to Provide Over 4,000 Technical Personnel to the Nation

This summer, higher industrial schools in East China can supply the nation with a total of 4,780+ technical personnel in thirty-seven specialized fields. In August, this group of graduates will participate in the nation's geological, power, machinery, chemical, and civil construction teams.

Several new majors established in higher industrial schools in East China have their first graduates this year. Specialized technical personnel studying industrial enterprise electrification and casting, metal pressure processing, metallographic heat treatment, and other majors in the machinery manufacturing industry have never been trained in old China. The number of graduates in many majors has increased this year compared to last year. The number of graduates in majors such as "Mineral Geology and Exploration," "Hydrochloric Acid Technology," "Surveying and Surveying Engineering," and "Small and Medium-sized Hydropower Station Construction" has increased by more than two times compared to last year. The number of graduates in the "Metal Cutting Machine Tools and Their Tools" major has increased thirteen times compared to last year. There were no graduates in the "Hydrogeology and Engineering Geology" major last year, but this year there are 178 graduates.

    华东区高等工业学校
    今年暑期可供给国家四千多名技术人才
    华东区高等工业学校今年暑期可以供给国家三十七种专门技术人才共四千七百八十多人。这批毕业生将在八月间分别参加到国家的地质、动力、机械、化工、土木建筑等各个建设的队伍中去。
    华东区高等工业学校设立的若干新专业，今年第一次有了毕业生。如学习工业企业电气化专业和学习机械制造工业中的铸造、金属压力加工、金相热处理等专业的专门技术人才，是旧中国从来没有培养过的。今年许多专业毕业生的人数比去年有了增加。“矿产地质和勘探”、“盐酸工艺学”、“测量学与测量工程”、“中小型水力发电站建筑”等专业毕业生，都比去年增加了两倍以上。“金属切削机床及其工具”专业毕业生比去年增加了十三倍。“水文地质和工程地质”专业去年没有毕业生，今年有毕业生一百七十八人。
