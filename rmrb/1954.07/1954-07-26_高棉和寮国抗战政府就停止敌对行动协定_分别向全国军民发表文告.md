Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, July 25th:  The President of the Cambodian Resistance Government, Son Ngoc Minh, issued a statement to the Cambodian army and people on July 23rd regarding the Cambodian Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities. The full text is as follows:

Fellow compatriots, fighters, and cadres:

    In the past eight years, our military and civilians have risen up to fight valiantly alongside the people of Vietnam and Laos. We have also received enthusiastic support from France and the people of the world. As a result, our patriotic war has achieved many victories. The French government agreed to negotiate the restoration of peace in Cambodia, Vietnam, and Laos at the Geneva Conference.

    On July 21, 1954, the Agreements on the Cessation of Hostilities in Cambodia, Vietnam, and Laos were signed at the Geneva Conference.

    The countries participating in the Geneva Conference have recognized the national independence and sovereignty of Cambodia, as well as the national independence and sovereignty of Vietnam and Laos, and have agreed that foreign troops should withdraw within a prescribed period, that foreign military bases should be prohibited from being established on our territory, and that free and fair national elections should be held in 1955. All Cambodian citizens shall enjoy freedom and democratic rights, especially the right to vote and to be elected.

    Under the eighty years of French colonial rule in our country, our nation was deprived of its independence, and our people were deprived of their freedom and democratic rights. Today, thanks to the heroic struggle of our military and civilians over the past eight years, the countries participating in the Geneva Conference have reached agreement on the above clauses, especially the clauses concerning the withdrawal of foreign troops from our country and the prohibition of any country from establishing military bases in Cambodia. This is a significant victory for all our military and civilians. This is an important condition for our people to continue to move forward in order to consolidate peace and realize independence and democracy throughout the country, and to bring a new era in history to the Cambodian people.

    All military and civilians should clearly recognize the important significance of this victory. Our victory is also the victory of our two neighboring countries—Vietnam and Laos—and of peace-loving people in the world.

    On behalf of the Cambodian Resistance Government, I earnestly call on all people, cadres, and combatants:

    1. Strictly implement the Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities in Cambodia signed at the Geneva Conference, and at the same time, maintain our fighting spirit and heighten our vigilance in the struggle to urge the other party to correctly implement the agreements that have been reached.

    2. Strive to consolidate and develop our strength in all aspects in order to consolidate peace and realize the independence and unity of our motherland by striving to implement democratic reforms and improve the living conditions of our people.

    3. Constantly heighten our vigilance against bad elements and saboteurs of peace.

    4. Further strengthen our unity with the people of Vietnam, the people of Laos, the people of France, and all peace-loving people in the world.

    Dear compatriots, cadres, and combatants!

    Our victory, although great, is only preliminary. In order to consolidate peace, realize the independence, unity, and democracy of our motherland, and contribute to defending world peace and democracy, we still need to carry out arduous and long-term struggles.

    As long as all of our people are united and fight with one heart and one mind, victory will surely be ours.

    Long live the peace, independence, unity, and democracy of Cambodia!

            Son Ngoc Minh (signed)
            Chairman of the Cambodian Resistance Government
            July 23, 1954

Xinhua News Agency, Vientiane, July 24th: Laotian Resistance Government Premier Souphanouvong issued a statement on the Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities. The full text of the statement is as follows:

Fellow compatriots, combatants, and cadres:

    In the past eight years, all our compatriots, combatants, and cadres have consistently united closely, endured all kinds of suffering, and struggled for the peace, independence, unity, and democracy of our motherland. In the course of this struggle, the people of Vietnam and Cambodia, especially the volunteer personnel of the Vietnamese people, have strengthened their solidarity with our people and actively helped us in our patriotic war. The peace-loving people of the world, especially the French people, have approved and supported our just war. Because of this, we have achieved many victories. It is precisely because of the growing resistance forces of the peoples of Laos, Vietnam, and Cambodia that the French government agreed to negotiate the issue of restoring peace in Indochina at the Geneva Conference. Thanks to the struggle waged by our people and the peoples of Vietnam and Cambodia, the support of peace-loving people in the world, and the struggle waged by the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam at the Geneva Conference, as well as the assistance of the delegations of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, we have achieved a significant victory. The French government has signed the agreement on the cessation of hostilities throughout Indochina. The countries participating in the Geneva Conference have recognized the sovereignty and independence of our country and have agreed that foreign troops should withdraw from our territory within a certain period.

    In order to achieve peace, the first step is to implement a ceasefire. The Laotian People's Liberation Army will regroup into a large area including the provinces of Sam Neua, Phongsaly, and part of Luang Prabang.

    Only after the ceasefire is realized will there be conditions to resolve other issues through political means.

    After the ceasefire is realized, free and fair national elections will be held throughout the country.

    Therefore, the Laotian Resistance Government calls on the people, army, and cadres to faithfully fulfill the provisions of the Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities in Laos signed at the Geneva Conference.

    In order to consolidate peace and realize independence, unity, and democracy, we still need to carry out long-term and arduous struggle. Our people, army, and cadres must strictly implement the Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilites in Laos, and continue to strive to achieve the terms reached at the Geneva Conference regarding respecting our country's independence and sovereignty, and for the withdrawal of foreign troops from our territory in accordance with the agreement.

    We must strive to consolidate peace and maintain a high degree of vigilance against all destructive actions of war-mongers. Therefore, we must strengthen our unity and strive for free and fair elections to unify our country and realize the true independence of our motherland.

    We must strive to consolidate and develop our strength and influence, to implement democratic reforms and improve the living conditions of our people.

    We must consolidate our unity with the people of Vietnam and Cambodia, and strengthen our friendship with the people of France and the peace-loving people of the world.

    I call on our compatriots, combatants, cadres, and all patriotic people, regardless of political affiliation and political party, to unite and work together to consolidate peace and to realize independence, unity, and democracy.

    Long live the peace, independence, unity, and democracy of Laos!

          Souphanouvong (signature)
          Premier of the Laotian Resistance Government
          July 23, 1954, in Laos

    高棉和寮国抗战政府就停止敌对行动协定
    分别向全国军民发表文告
    【新华社二十五日讯】越南通讯社高棉二十五日讯：高棉抗战政府山玉明主席在七月二十三日就高棉停止敌对行动协定，向高棉的军队和人民发表文告。全文如下：全国同胞们，战斗员们和干部们：
    在过去八年中，我国军民起来同越南和寮国人民并肩进行英勇的战斗。我们还得到了法国和世界人民的热烈支援。结果，我们的爱国战争取得了许多胜利。法国政府同意在日内瓦会议上谈判恢复高棉、越南和寮国的和平问题。
    一九五四年七月二十一日，在日内瓦会议上签订了高棉、越南和寮国三国停止敌对行动的协定。
    参加日内瓦会议的国家已承认高棉的国家独立和主权以及越南和寮国的国家独立和主权，并且议定外国军队要在规定的时期以内撤退，禁止外国在我们国土上建立军事基地，一九五五年在全国举行自由普选，高棉全体公民都享有自由和民主权利，特别是选举权和被选举权。
    在法国对我国实行的八十年的殖民统治下，我们国家被剥夺了独立，我国人民被剥夺了自由和民主权利。今天，由于我国军民在过去八年中的英勇斗争，参加日内瓦会议的国家已对上述条款，特别是关于外国军队应从我国撤退和不准任何国家在高棉建立军事基地的条款，达成了协议。这是我国全体军民的一个重大胜利。这是我国人民继续前进以求巩固和平和在整个国家实现独立和民主、并给高棉人民带来历史上的新时期的重要条件。
    全体军民应该清楚地认识这个胜利的重要意义。我们的胜利也就是我们两个邻邦——越南和寮国，以及世界上的和平爱好者的胜利。
    我代表高棉抗战政府热诚地号召全体人民、干部和战斗人员：
    一、严格地执行在日内瓦会议上签订的关于高棉停止敌对行动的协定，同时在督促对方正确地执行已经达成的协定的斗争中，保持我们的战斗精神，提高我们的警惕。
    二、努力为实现民主改革，改善我们人民的生活条件，在各方面巩固和发展我们的力量而奋斗，以便巩固和平，实现祖国的独立和统一。
    三、不断地提高对坏分子、和平的破坏者的警惕。
    四、进一步加强我们和越南人民、寮国人民、法国人民以及全世界的和平爱好者的团结。
    亲爱的同胞们、干部们和战斗人员们！
    我们的胜利虽然是巨大的，但只是初步的。为了巩固和平，实现我们祖国的独立、统一和民主，并对保卫世界的和平和民主有所贡献，我们仍需进行艰苦的、长期的斗争。
    只要我们全体人民团结一致、万众一心地去进行斗争，胜利必然是我们的。
    高棉的和平、独立、统一和民主万岁！
            高棉抗战政府主席　山玉明（签字）
                    一九五四年七月二十三日
    【新华社二十五日讯】越南通讯社寮国二十四日讯：寮国抗战政府总理苏发努冯就停止敌对行动协定发表文告。文告全文如下：
    全国同胞们、战斗人员们和干部们：
    在过去八年中，我国全体同胞、战斗人员和干部始终紧密地团结一致，经历了种种痛苦，为争取祖国的和平、独立、统一和民主而斗争。在这个斗争过程中，越南和高棉人民，特别是越南人民的志愿人员，已经加强了他们和我国人民的团结，并积极帮助我们进行爱国战争。世界爱好和平的人民，特别是法国人民，赞同并支持了我们的正义的战争。由于这一点，我们取得了许多胜利。正是由于寮国、越南和高棉三国人民日益增长的抵抗力量，法国政府才同意在日内瓦会议谈判恢复印度支那和平的问题。由于我国人民及越南和高棉人民所进行的斗争，由于世界爱好和平的人们的支持，以及由于在日内瓦会议上越南民主共和国代表团所进行的斗争和苏联及中华人民共和国两国代表团的帮助，我们已经获得重大的胜利。法国政府已经在印度支那全境停止敌对行动的协定上签字。参加日内瓦会议的国家已经承认我们国家的主权和独立，并同意外国军队在一定时期内从我国撤退。
    为了实现和平，第一个步骤是必须实行停火，寮国人民解放军将重新集结到包括桑怒、丰沙里和琅勃剌邦省的一部分的大片地区内。
    只有在停战实现以后，才有条件通过政治方法解决其他问题。
    在停战实现以后，全国将举行自由的普选。
    因此，寮国抗战政府号召人民、军队和干部们忠实地履行在日内瓦会议上签订的关于停止敌对行动协定的规定。
    为了巩固和平和实现独立、统一和民主，我们仍须进行长期的和艰苦的斗争。我们的人民、军队和干部必须严格地履行关于在寮国停止敌对行动的协定，并继续为实现在日内瓦会议所达成的关于尊重我国的独立和主权，以及外国军队根据协定撤离我国领土的条款而奋斗。
    我们必须努力巩固和平，并对战争贩子的一切破坏行动保持高度的警惕。因此我们必须加强我们的团结，并为实行自由的普选以统一我们的国家和实现我们祖国的真正的独立而奋斗。
    我们必须努力巩固和发展我们的力量和影响，以实行民主改革并改善我们人民的生活条件。
    我们必须巩固我们同越南和高棉人民的团结，加强我们和法国人民以及世界上爱好和平的人们的友谊。
    我号召我们的同胞、战斗人员、干部以及一切不分政治关系和政治党派的爱国人士团结起来，为巩固和平，以及为实现独立、统一和民主而携手奋斗。
    寮国的和平、独立、统一和民主万岁！
          寮国抗战政府总理　苏发努冯（签名）
            一九五四年七月二十三日于寮国
