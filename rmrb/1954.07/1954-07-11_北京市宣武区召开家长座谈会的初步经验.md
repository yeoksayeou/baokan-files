Preliminary Experiences of the Xuanwu District, Beijing, in Holding Parent-Teacher Conferences
Beijing Xuanwu District People's Government, Culture and Education Section

In order to prepare this year's graduating primary school students for further education and participation in labor production, we decided that every school in the district should hold a parent-teacher conference for graduating classes. In early June, we first conducted a key experimental project at Chenghuangmiao Street Primary School. Afterward, we organized and convened meetings in batches throughout the district. Currently, nineteen schools have held parent-teacher conferences.

These conferences have been relatively successful and have yielded significant results: First, they have initially resolved the problem of parents' single-minded focus on their children's further education. Previously, most parents believed that the only path for their children after graduation was to continue their education. Now, many parents have expressed their support for the three paths pointed out by the government: further education, participation in labor production, and self-study. Some parents have said: If their children cannot pass the entrance exam for middle school after graduation, it would be honorable for them to become machinists, bricklayers, or carpenters. Second, they have conducted patriotic education for parents. Previously, many parents generally lacked a correct understanding of the purpose of sending their children to school. After this promotion, the problem has been initially resolved. Some parents said: In the past, we sent our children to school to get promoted and become wealthy, to bring honor to our ancestors; today, we realize that learning is to prepare to participate in labor production and build the motherland. Everyone recognized that the idea that "all professions are lowly, only studying is noble" is a wrong idea. Third, they have made parents further appreciate the government's care for their children. Many parents said: When we went to school, nobody ever cared about what we would do after graduation. After participating in the parent-teacher conference, we deeply felt that the People's Government cares about children even more than their parents do. Fourth, they have changed the erroneous attitude of some parents towards their children. For example, Xu Yiyun's mother, a student at Chenghuangmiao Street Primary School, originally demanded that her child must go to middle school because no one in her family was literate. She even said: "If you pass the middle school entrance exam, I will give you anything you want. If you don't pass the middle school entrance exam, I will lock you at home and make you do 'dirty work' every day." After the meeting, she said to her child: "I won't force you or scold you if you don't pass the middle school entrance exam."

We have learned in our work that to hold a successful parent-teacher conference, we must first rely on the leadership's emphasis on this work. We conducted a key experimental project under the direct leadership of the Xuanwu District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, helped the school study working methods, and promptly summarized the experience of the key experimental project, and then carried out this work throughout the district.

To hold a good parent-teacher conference, preparation must be done well. The preparation work mainly includes the following aspects:

First, deeply understand and study the parents' ideological situation. This is so that we can carry out propaganda in a targeted manner. There are two ways to understand the parents' ideological situation: one is to indirectly understand from the students; the other is to directly communicate with the parents through home visits. Many schools met with the vast majority of parents before holding the parent-teacher conference.

Second, the school should fully prepare the report for the parent-teacher conference. This report should be linked to the actual situation of the city and the district, linked to the parents' thinking, and comprehensively and correctly publicize the government's policies on the further education and participation in labor production of graduating primary school students, and explain the nature, purpose, and tasks of primary school education. The report should be in plain language and the time should not be too long.

Third, during home visits, discover and cultivate active parents and invite them to speak at the parent-teacher conference to enlighten everyone. The speeches of active parents can supplement the shortcomings of the teacher's report, and using the specific ideological changes of specific people to educate parents can deepen parents' understanding of government policies. It should be noted here that active parents should be representative. If there are many working people among the parents of the students in this class, but the key speakers are all intellectuals, then the educational effect will not be great. The school should preferably help active parents prepare the content of their speeches, help them connect with their own thoughts, and talk about their opinions and views on government policies. The speaking time should also not be too long.

Fourth, do a good job in mobilizing parents to attend. The notification should be sent early, generally one week in advance, so that parents can be prepared and arrange time to attend; it can also give teachers time to persuade parents to attend. In order to encourage students to mobilize parents to attend, the importance of the parent-teacher conference should be explained to the students, and it should be explained that if parents do not come, they will not be clear about their children's affairs after graduation; students should also be encouraged to help parents with some things so that parents can take time to attend. For example, if the parents are vendors, help the parents look after the stall; if the mother has small children that she cannot leave, help the mother look after the children, etc. Teachers should also mobilize parents to attend when making home visits. The meeting time should also try to avoid conflicting with the working hours of most parents, generally on Sunday afternoons. Public and educational personnel generally rest on Sundays, and they can take half a day to attend the meeting. Holding the meeting in the afternoon can take care of the mothers, who have many things to do in the morning, such as buying food, cooking, and washing clothes; it can also take care of workers who work night shifts, who can rest in the morning and then come to the meeting in the afternoon. Because we attach importance to mobilizing parents, the attendance rate of parents in each school is quite high. The parent-teacher conferences held by the first batch of eleven schools invited 898 people, and 799 people actually attended, accounting for about 90% of the number of people invited.

Fifth, attention should also be paid to the layout of the venue. It is best for everyone to talk around a table. Try to avoid the form of a mass meeting where one person makes a report and everyone listens to the report. If conditions permit, the venue can be simply decorated in accordance with the spirit of solemnity and liveliness, and charts and graphs illustrating the development of education since liberation can be posted in the venue.

The school must ensure that the meeting is conducted from beginning to end in an atmosphere of harmony, mutual care, and friendly consultation. The school should let parents understand that the parent-teacher conference is being held to work with parents to find ways to properly solve the problem of graduating primary school students' further education and participation in labor production. They should welcome parents' speeches and questions, and listen carefully. The school should study in advance the questions that parents may raise, and answer them concretely and in detail if they should be answered by the school; for some questions, they should jointly study solutions with the parents at the meeting. Under no circumstances should problems be discussed with parents in an antagonistic manner.

It is impossible for all the ideological problems of parents regarding their children's further education and participation in labor production to be completely resolved at one parent-teacher conference. The school must pay attention to correcting the view of some teachers that once the parent-teacher conference is over, "everything will be fine." After the meeting, they should continue to pay attention to collecting feedback and conduct more detailed publicity and education work for parents with emphasis.

    北京市宣武区召开家长座谈会的初步经验
    北京市宣武区人民政府文教科
    为了做好今年高小毕业生升学和参加劳动生产的准备工作，我们确定全区每个学校都要召开一次毕业班学生家长座谈会。六月初，先在城隍庙街小学进行重点试验工作，以后，就有领导地在全区分批召开。现在已有十九个学校召开了家长座谈会。
    这些座谈会都开得比较好，有不少收获：一、初步解决了家长们单纯要求子女升学的思想问题。以前，一般家长认为子女毕业后只有升学一条路。现在很多家长都表示：政府指出的三条道路——升学，参加劳动生产，自学，都赞成。有的家长说：孩子毕业以后，如果考不上中学，当机器匠、瓦匠、木匠都是光荣的。二、向家长进行了爱国主义教育。以前许多家长对于送子女上学读书的目的，一般都缺乏正确的认识，经过这次宣传，问题得到初步解决。有的家长说：过去叫孩子上学是为了升官发财，光宗耀祖；今天认识到，学习是为了准备参加劳动生产，建设祖国。大家都认识了“万般皆下品，唯有读书高”是错误的思想。三、使家长们进一步体会到政府对于孩子们的关怀。许多家长表示：从前我们上学的时候，毕业后干什么，从来没人过问，参加了座谈会，深深体会到人民政府关心孩子，比家长还周到。四、使部分家长改变了对待孩子的错误态度。例如，城隍庙街小学学生徐毅云的母亲，因为家里没有识字的人，原来要求孩子必须升上中学。还表示：考上中学要什么给什么，考不上中学关在家里天天让干“脏活”。会后，她对孩子说：“考不上中学也不逼你不骂你了。”
    我们在工作中体会到，要开好家长座谈会，首先要靠领导方面重视这一工作。我们是在中共北京市宣武区委会的直接领导下进行了重点试验工作，帮助学校研究了工作方法，并及时地总结了重点试验工作经验，然后在全区开展这一工作的。
    要开好家长会议，必须作好准备工作。准备工作主要包括下面几方面：
    一、深入了解和研究家长的思想情况。这是为了可以有的放矢地进行宣传。了解家长思想情况有两种方式，一种是向学生侧面了解；另一种是通过家庭访问直接和家长交谈。许多学校在召开座谈会以前和绝大多数家长见了面。
    二、学校应当充分准备好座谈会上的报告。这个报告要联系本市、本区的实际情况，联系家长的思想，全面地、正确地宣传政府关于高小毕业生升学和参加劳动生产问题的政策，讲清小学教育的性质、目的和任务。报告要用通俗易懂的语言，时间不可太长。
    三、在家庭访问中，要发现和培养家长积极分子，请他们在座谈会上发言，以启发大家。家长积极分子的发言，可以补充教师报告之不足，而且，用具体人物的具体思想变化来向家长进行教育，可以加深家长对政府政策的了解。这里应该注意，家长积极分子要有代表性，如果这一班的学生家长中，劳动人民很多，而重点发言人都是知识分子，那教育作用就不会很大的。学校最好能帮助家长积极分子准备发言的内容，帮助他们联系自己的思想，好好谈谈对于政府政策的意见、看法。发言时间也不宜太长。
    四、要做好动员家长出席的工作。通知要发得早，一般说应在一周前送给家长，以便家长有所准备，可以安排时间到会；也可使教师有时间来做说服家长到会的工作。为了鼓励学生动员家长到会，要向学生说明座谈会的重要性，说明如果家长不来，对学生毕业后的事情就会弄不清楚；还要鼓励学生帮助家长作些事情，使家长能够抽出时间到会。例如，家长是摊贩的，帮助家长看摊子；妈妈有小孩子分不开身的，帮助妈妈看孩子等。教师进行家庭访问的时候，也要做动员家长到会的工作。开会时间也要尽量避免和多数家长的工作时间相冲突，一般说以星期日下午为宜。公教人员星期日一般都休息，他们可以抽出半天时间来参加会议的。下午开会，可以照顾母亲们，她们上午要买菜、做饭、洗衣，事情很多；也可以照顾做夜班的工人，他们上午休息后，下午就可以来开会。由于我们重视动员家长的工作，所以各校家长出席率相当高。第一批十一个学校举行的家长座谈会，邀请了八百九十八人，实到七百九十九人，约占邀请人数百分之九十。
    五、会场布置也要注意，最好是大家围桌而谈。要尽可能地避免一人做报告大家听报告的那种开大会形式。如果有条件，可以根据严肃活泼的精神，简单地布置一下会场，准备一些说明解放以来教育发展情况的图表在会场上张贴。
    学校必须注意使会议自始至终在和谐的、相互关怀的、亲切商量问题的空气中进行。学校方面要让家长们体会到，召开家长座谈会，是为了和家长们共同来想办法妥善地解决高小毕业生升学和参加劳动生产的问题。对于家长的发言和提问题，要表示欢迎，要仔细倾听。学校要事先研究家长们可能提出的问题，应由学校解答的，要具体、详细地解答；有些问题，便和家长在会上共同研究办法来解决。在任何情况下，都要避免和家长针锋相对地来谈问题。
    家长们对于子女升学和参加劳动生产的各种思想问题，是决不可能在一次座谈会上完全得到解决的。学校必须注意纠正一部分教师以为开完家长会就“万事大吉”的看法，应当在会后注意继续搜集反应，有重点地向家长们进行更细致的宣传教育工作。
