Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 15th: Sahib Singh Sok, winner of the Stalin International Peace Prize "For Strengthening International Peace," published an article on the Indian peace movement in "Pravda" on the 14th. The article states: The US-Pakistan military treaty has pushed the danger of war to India's doorstep and made all sensible Indians realize that international disputes are not abstract matters unrelated to them, but are directly related to them, threatening the freedom India recently gained. International disputes concern the Indian people, just as they concern the people of other countries who love and cherish freedom. Due to this understanding, Indians are increasingly aware that conflicts occurring anywhere, such as the threat of American armed intervention in the Indochina war, measures to rearm Germany, activities that divide Asia and Europe into various military blocs, the suppression of national liberation movements, and hydrogen bomb threats—all of these are interconnected and essentially reflect the same phenomenon.

The author points out that there is a huge possibility in India to expand the peace movement and enable more and more people to participate in various mass rallies. The achievements of the Indian peace defenders' conference held in Delhi in May this year, although modest, are a good start.

Referring to the conflict in Indochina, the author emphasizes: In order to peacefully resolve the Indochina conflict, it is necessary to create a peaceful atmosphere conducive to negotiation without threats, to stop the war, for France to clearly declare its abandonment of any colonial ambitions in Indochina, and for relevant parties to conduct direct negotiations without any foreign interference. The author emphasizes that the Indian people increasingly ardently hope that the Geneva Conference will achieve significant success, even though the Korean issue was not resolved at the conference. The outcome of the conference solely on the Indochina issue will have a profound impact on the future of Asia, and in fact, the entire world.

The author concludes by writing that the people of Asia can achieve a great deal as long as they resolutely fight for peace. Not long ago, the Republic of India and the People's Republic of China signed the "Agreement on Trade and Traffic between the Tibet Region of China and India." This agreement is a good omen, and we hope that similar agreements can also be concluded between Burma, China, India, and Indonesia. The visits of Premier Zhou Enlai of the People's Republic of China to India and Burma, as well as the talks between Premier Zhou Enlai and the Prime Ministers of India and Burma, will further strengthen the friendship between these countries and will promote the consolidation of peace in Asia.

    索克在“真理报”上撰文论印度和平运动
    指出印度人民迫切希望日内瓦会议获得成就
    【新华社十五日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金得奖人萨希布·辛格·索克十四日在“真理报”上发表了一篇关于印度和平运动的文章。文章写道：美巴军事条约把战争的危险推到印度的门边，并使所有明智的印度人了解到：国际争端并不是抽象的、同他们无关的事情，而是同他们直接有关的事情，它使印度不久以前获得的自由处于威胁之下。国际争端关系到印度人，正像也关系到爱好自由和珍惜自由的其他国家人民一样。由于这种理解，印度人日益明显地认识到：任何地方所发生的冲突，如美国武装干涉印度支那战争的威胁，重新武装德国的措施，把亚洲和欧洲分裂成各种军事集团的活动，对民族解放运动的镇压和氢弹的恫吓——所有这一切都是互相关联的，而且本质上反映着同一个现象。
    作者指出，在印度有巨大的可能性来扩大和平运动和使越来越多的人参加各种群众集会。印度和平保卫者今年五月在德里举行的代表大会获得的成就虽然很平凡，却是一个良好的开端。
    作者讲到印度支那的冲突，他着重说：为了和平解决印度支那冲突，必须造成有利于商谈的、没有威胁的和平气氛，停止战火，法国明确地声明对印度支那放弃任何殖民野心，有关方面在不受任何外国干涉的情况下进行直接谈判。作者着重指出，印度人民日益迫切希望日内瓦会议将能获得重大成就，虽然朝鲜问题没有能够在会议上获得解决。会议仅在印度支那问题上获得的结局就将对亚洲的前途、实际上是全世界的前途发生深刻的影响。
    作者最后写道，亚洲人民只要为和平而坚决斗争，就可以获得很多的成就。不久以前，印度共和国和中华人民共和国签订了关于中国西藏地方和印度之间的通商和交通协定。这项协定是一个良好的预兆，我们希望在缅甸、中国、印度和印尼之间也能缔结类似这样的协定。中华人民共和国总理周恩来的访问印度和缅甸以及周恩来总理和印度总理及缅甸总理的会谈将更加加强这些国家之间的友谊，并将促进亚洲和平的巩固。
