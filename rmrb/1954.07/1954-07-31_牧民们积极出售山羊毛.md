    Herdsmen Actively Sell Goat Wool

    The broad masses of herdsmen and farmers in Ningxia Province are enthusiastically selling goat wool. The Ningxia Provincial Company of the China Animal Products Company overfulfilled its second-quarter goat wool procurement plan in mid-June.

    Since liberation, the output of wool in Ningxia Province has increased year by year. However, in the past, many people used wool to weave pockets, consuming a large amount. During the second quarter, the province's animal products company and supply and marketing cooperative vigorously publicized the benefits of selling wool to the country and individuals, and the procurement of goat wool increased significantly. The amount of goat wool purchased by the Bayanhot branch of the China Animal Products Company in May exceeded the original plan by more than three times. Ma Ruhai and other herdsmen in Wuzhong City heard that goat wool could be exported in exchange for machinery, and sold the goat wool they had originally planned to use for weaving wool pockets to the state.

    牧民们积极出售山羊毛
    宁夏省广大牧民和农民踊跃出售山羊毛，中国畜产公司宁夏省公司第二季度收购山羊毛的计划，在六月中旬就超额完成了。
    解放以来，宁夏省羊毛的产量逐年增加。但是过去有不少群众用羊毛来织口袋，消耗量很大。第二季度内，该省的畜产公司和供销合作社向群众大力宣传了出售羊毛对国家和个人的好处，山羊毛收购量增加很多。中国畜产公司巴音浩特支公司五月份收购山羊毛的数量，超过原订计划三倍以上。吴忠市牧民马如海等听说山羊毛可以出口换机器，把原来准备织毛口袋的山羊毛也卖给了国家。
