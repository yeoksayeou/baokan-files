　　The celebration was hosted by the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace.

　　The venue was solemn and grand. The presidium of the conference, composed of prominent figures from all walks of life, was seated on the rostrum. They were: Peng Zhen, Liao Chengzhi, Liu Ningyi, Mao Dun, Cai Tingkai, Zhang Bojun, Li Siguang, Liang Xi, Li Zhuchen, Li Dequan, Wu Han, Sha Qianli, Liu Guanyi.

　　More than two thousand people attended today's conference, including: Standing committee members and heads of various departments of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, heads and representatives of national democratic parties and people's organizations, staff members of directly affiliated organs of the Central People's Government, staff members of various organs in Beijing, and people from all walks of life.

　　At 7:30 p.m., the celebration began amidst thunderous applause. Peng Zhen, Vice Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, first spoke at the meeting (full text to be published separately, see page 2). His report repeatedly garnered enthusiastic applause from the audience.

　　Those who spoke at the celebration included: Cai Tingkai, Standing Committee Member of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang; Zhang Bojun, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League; Li Zhuchen, Deputy Director of the General Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association; Liu Ningyi, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions; Li Dequan, Vice Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation; Wu Han, Vice Chairman of the All-China Youth Federation; Mao Dun, Vice Chairman of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles; Li Siguang, Chairman of the China Association for Science and Technology; Liang Xi, Chairman of the China Association for Science and Technology Popularization; and Sha Qianli, Secretary of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce. They all celebrated the historically significant great victory of reaching an agreement on the cessation of hostilities and the restoration of peace in Indochina, and expressed their willingness to work with the entire Chinese people and the people of the world to strive for the thorough implementation of all agreements, and to continue to work tirelessly to safeguard peace in Asia and the world. Their speeches were warmly welcomed by the audience.

　　Cai Tingkai said: Our delegation, adhering to our government's consistent peaceful diplomatic policy and representing the will of the 600 million Chinese people, worked tirelessly throughout the Geneva Conference, together with the Soviet and Democratic Republic of Vietnam delegations, and made extremely important contributions to the reaching of an agreement at the conference. This has greatly enhanced our country's international prestige. Here, we express our highest respect to our delegation headed by Premier Zhou Enlai!

　　The people of Indochina, in order to oppose the rule of the colonialists and to strive for national independence and democratic freedom, have undergone eight years of heroic resistance and finally, with the sympathy and support of peace-loving people all over the world, have achieved their aspirations for peace and independence, which is of great significance for promoting collective security in Asia and easing international tensions. Here, we express our warm congratulations to the great victory achieved by the just struggle of the people of Indochina!

　　While celebrating victory, we should also raise our vigilance. The warmongering group in the United States is unwilling to accept the failure at the Geneva Conference, and its conspiracy to consistently antagonize the Chinese people will not cease there. Recently, it has intensified its instigation of the Chiang Kai-shek remnant bandits in a vain attempt to harass and sabotage People's China. We should always strengthen our preparations to smash all its evil attempts. We believe that if we and the peace forces of the world unite closely, we will surely be able to defend peace and defeat war!

　　Zhang Bojun said: The fact that an agreement could be reached on the Indochina issue illuminates the prospect of collective peace in Asia and the world. The Five Principles of mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence, put forward in the recent joint statement by Premier Zhou and the Prime Ministers of India and Burma, have been warmly welcomed and supported by many countries in Asia and peace-loving people all over the world. The reaching of an agreement on the Indochina issue this time further proves in fact that countries with different socio-political systems in Asia and the world can coexist peacefully by acting in accordance with these five principles. This can naturally greatly increase the confidence of peace-loving people in Asia and the world, and strengthen the forces for maintaining collective peace in Asia and the world.

　　Of course, the implementation of the Indochina armistice and peace restoration agreement reached at the Geneva Conference still requires the unanimous efforts of the participating countries in the spirit of consultation shown at the Geneva Conference this time, and we must also maintain a high degree of vigilance against the conspiracies and sabotage of the warmongering elements of US imperialism. However, we believe that with the support of our government and people, as well as the peace-loving people of the world, any conspiracy to undermine the agreement is doomed to failure. Therefore, I firmly believe that the entire Chinese people will unite more closely around the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, redouble their efforts to carry out socialist construction and socialist transformation at home, continue to resolutely implement a peaceful diplomatic policy abroad, unite all forces that can be united, so as to ensure the thorough implementation of the Indochina armistice agreement, and liberate our sacred territory of Taiwan from the occupation of US imperialism, so that the lasting peace of Asia and the world can achieve final victory.

　　Li Zhuchen said: The agreement reached on the cessation of hostilities and the restoration of peace in Indochina is not only a major achievement of the Geneva Conference, it proves that international disputes can be resolved through peaceful consultation; countries with different systems can coexist peacefully. It also proves that as long as the people of the world take on the cause of peace, the power of peace is great and invincible.

　　Through this Geneva Conference, China's status as one of the world's major powers has been recognized internationally, which makes me feel more and more the greatness and loveliness of our country. I firmly believe that our comrades in the China Democratic National Construction Association and gentlemen from the industrial and commercial circles have the same feelings as I do. Members of the China Democratic National Construction Association and all patriotic national industrialists and businessmen should strive to participate in the country's socialist construction, sincerely accept socialist transformation, actively engage in production and management, and contribute their respective strengths to the country's industrialization and the realization of the first five-year plan.

　　Liu Ningyi said: The restoration of peace in Indochina is first of all the result of the long-term heroic struggle of the people of Indochina for their national independence and liberation. Facts have proved that a nation that is awakened and determined to strive for independence, freedom and peace is invincible, because they are supported and sympathized with by the people of the world.

　　The three countries of Indochina are our neighbors, and our people wholeheartedly celebrate their achievement of peace and independence. The people and working class of our country will be more encouraged and inspired. In the future, we must work harder to realize the country's socialist industrialization and socialist transformation, and to implement the general task of the country during the transition period. At the same time, we must continue to be vigilant, prevent any conspiracy activities of US imperialism, and strive to oppose the power politics of the US imperialists, to liberate Taiwan, and to maintain and consolidate lasting world peace.

　　Li Dequan said: The issue of the cessation of hostilities and the restoration of peace in Indochina, which the people of the world are closely concerned about, has been agreed upon at the Geneva Conference. This is a major victory for the peace-loving people of the world in easing international tensions and striving for world peace! This victory greatly helps to ensure the peaceful life of the people, women and children of Indochina and all of Asia and the world. I, on behalf of all Chinese women, fully agree with and support these agreements. We want to work with the people of the whole country to strive for the thorough implementation of this agreement and to work hard to maintain and consolidate world peace.

　　Wu Han said: Our youth are overjoyed and inspired by the great achievements of the Geneva Conference. Our youth fully support and support the Geneva Conference's agreement on the Indochina issue, and are determined to work with the people of our country to strive for the thorough implementation of these agreements and to make further efforts to defend peace in Asia and the world.

　　Our youth will be in their posts, with active work, hard study, and physical exercise, to train themselves to become outstanding builders and defenders of the motherland, so as to enhance the strength to defend peace in Asia and the world, be vigilant against any conspiracy to undermine peace, and better build our great socialist society.

　　Mao Dun said: The success of the Geneva Conference once again proves the strength of the forces of peace, and proves that the consistent peaceful policy of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union is in line with the interests of the people of the world. The Geneva Conference has opened up a bright prospect for collective peace and security in Asia; and has achieved further achievements in easing the international situation.

　　Together with the people of the whole country, we, the literary and art workers, are extremely excited about the victorious success of the Geneva Conference. The Chinese delegation headed by Premier and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai, which participated in the Geneva Conference, has won the praise of the people all over the world for its unremitting efforts and outstanding contributions to world peace throughout the entire conference, based on our country's consistent peaceful diplomatic policy and the Chinese people's will for peace. We would like to express our highest respect to our delegation for this great achievement.

　　All comrades in our literary and art circles are determined to work hard to serve the construction of the motherland together with the people of the whole country. We are willing to work with peace-loving literary and art workers in Asia and the world to closely unite and work together to expose the conspiracies of the war-mongers and to defend world peace.

　　Li Siguang said: As scientific workers, we have a major responsibility and can provide important contributions to the work of strengthening the forces of peace. First of all, we must dedicate all our strength to making the greatest efforts in the implementation of our country's general line, the country's socialist industrialization, and the improvement of scientific and technological levels. At the same time, we must unite scientists all over the world, with the common goal of maintaining world peace and serving human happiness with science, like the lofty contributions made by outstanding Soviet scientists and engineers, using atomic energy for peaceful construction. In this way, we believe that the forces of peace will inevitably grow stronger. The achievements of the Geneva Conference have provided us with favorable conditions for our efforts in this regard.

　　Liang Xi said: The restoration of peace in Indochina is not only the deep wish of the people of Indochina, but also the common demand of the peace-loving people of Asia and the world. Chinese scientific workers deeply know the value of peace, because only in a peaceful environment is it possible for science to develop and for the broad masses of working people to enjoy the benefits of science. We scientific workers, together with the people of the whole country, will make persistent efforts to support the thorough implementation of this agreement, and strive to oppose the new danger of war and defend peace in Asia and the world.

　　Sha Qianli said: When our national industrial and commercial circles celebrate the cessation of hostilities and the restoration of peace in Indochina, and when we celebrate the brilliant contributions made by our delegation to solving major international problems, we must unite more closely around the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, actively operate, work hard to produce, build our country into a stronger country, and strive to oppose war conspiracies and strive for lasting peace to the end.

　　The meeting finally unanimously adopted the resolution of the Capital's Celebration of the Indochina Armistice Conference.

　　At the end of the meeting, the audience applauded for a long time, rejoicing for the victory of reaching an agreement on the cessation of hostilities and the restoration of peace in Indochina, for the victory of the peaceful diplomatic policy of the peace, democracy and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and for the great increase in the international prestige of the People's Republic of China.

    庆祝印度支那停战和恢复和平问题达成协议
    首都各界举行盛大庆祝会
    【新华社二十三日讯】首都各界人民二十三日晚举行盛大集会，热烈庆祝日内瓦会议关于印度支那停战和恢复和平问题达成协议。
    庆祝大会由中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主持。
    会场庄严隆重。大会主席台上坐满了由各界著名人士组成的主席团，他们是：彭真、廖承志、刘宁一、茅盾、蔡廷锴、章伯钧、李四光、梁希、李烛尘、李德全、吴晗、沙千里、刘贯一。
    出席今天大会的有：中国人民保卫世界和平委员会在京常务委员和各部门负责人，全国各民主党派、各人民团体的负责人和代表，中央人民政府直属机关的工作人员，北京市各机关的工作人员和各界人民群众等两千多人。
    出席大会的外宾有：越南民主共和国驻我国大使馆临时代办周亮，泰国著名的公众领袖?比里·拍侬荣，亚洲及太平洋区域和平联络委员会副秘书长龟田东伍、委员中村翫右卫门，尼泊尔公众领袖凯·埃·辛格博士等。
    七时半，庆祝大会在雷鸣般的掌声中开始，中国人民保卫世界和平委员会副主席彭真在会上首先讲话（全文另发，见第二版）。他的报告一再博得了全场的热烈掌声。
    在庆祝大会上讲话的有：中国国民党革命委员会中央常务委员会委员蔡廷锴，中国民主同盟中央委员会副主席章伯钧，中国民主建国会总会委员会副主任委员李烛尘，中华全国总工会副主席刘宁一，中华全国民主妇女联合会副主席李德全，中华全国民主青年联合会副主席吴晗，中国文学艺术界联合会副主席茅盾，中华全国自然科学专门学会联合会主席李四光，中华全国科学技术普及协会主席梁希，中华全国工商业联合会秘书长沙千里。他们都为印度支那停战和恢复和平问题达成协议这一富有历史意义的伟大胜利而欢庆，并表示要和全中国人民及全世界人民在一起，为保证全部协议的彻底实现而奋斗，并继续为维护亚洲和世界的和平而努力不懈。他们的讲话都受到了全场的热烈欢迎。
    蔡廷锴说：我国代表团本着我国政府一贯的和平外交政策，代表着我国六亿人民的意志，在日内瓦会议中，与苏联和越南民主共和国代表团一道，自始至终，努力不懈，为会议达成协议作出了极其重要的贡献，大大地提高了我国的国际威望，在这里，我们向以周恩来总理为首的我国代表团致以崇高的敬意！
    印度支那的人民为了反对殖民主义者的统治，为了争取民族独立和民主自由，经过了八年的英勇抗战，终于在全世界爱好和平人民的同情和支持下，达到了和平、独立的愿望，对于促进亚洲集体安全与缓和国际紧张局势，有着重大意义。在这里，我们对印度支那人民的正义斗争所获得的伟大胜利，表示热烈的祝贺！
    我们在欢呼胜利当中，应该同时提高我们的警惕。美国好战集团对于在日内瓦会议的失败是不甘心的，它一贯与中国人民为敌的阴谋是不会就此罢休的。最近它还在加紧指使蒋介石残余匪帮，妄图对人民中国进行骚扰和破坏。我们应该时刻加强准备，粉碎它的一切罪恶企图。我们相信，我们和全世界的和平力量紧紧团结在一起，我们一定能够保卫和平，战胜战争！
    章伯钧说：印度支那问题能够达成协议，照亮了亚洲和世界集体和平的前景。周总理最近和印、缅两国总理的联合声明中所提出的互相尊重领土主权，互不侵犯，互不干涉内政，平等互利及和平共处五项原则，曾经获得亚洲许多国家和全世界爱好和平人民的热烈欢迎和支持。这次印度支那问题达成协议，更从事实上证明了按照这五项原则办事，亚洲以及世界上不同社会政治制度的国家是可以和平共处的。这自然可以大大增加亚洲和世界爱好和平人民的信心，增强维护亚洲和世界集体和平的力量。
    当然日内瓦会议所达成的印度支那停战和恢复和平的协议的履行，还需要与会各国一致本着这次日内瓦会议所表现的协商精神去努力的，并且我们也不能不对美帝国主义好战分子的阴谋破坏，保持高度的警惕。但是我们相信，在我国政府和人民以至世界爱好和平的人民的支持下，任何想破坏协议的阴谋都是注定要失败的。因此我深信全中国人民必将更紧密地团结在中国共产党和毛主席的周围，加倍努力，在国内进行社会主义建设和社会主义改造，在国外继续坚决执行和平外交政策，团结一切可以团结的力量，以保证印度支那停战协议获得彻底的实现，并将我们的神圣的领土台湾从美帝国主义的占领下解放出来，使亚洲与世界的持久和平，得到最后的胜利。
    李烛尘说：印度支那停战和恢复和平所获致的协议，不仅是日内瓦会议的重大收获，它证明了国际争端是可以和平协商解决的；不同制度的国家是可以和平共处的。它还证明了只要全世界人民把和平事业担当起来，和平的力量是伟大的，是不可战胜的。
    通过这次日内瓦会议，中国是世界大国之一的地位已为国际所公认，使我愈益感到我们国家的伟大和可爱。我深信我们民主建国会的同志们，工商界先生们都和我有同样的感情。民建会员和一切爱国的民族工商业者们，都应该努力争取参加到国家的社会主义建设事业中去，真诚地接受社会主义改造，积极地搞好生产经营，为国家的工业化和第一个五年计划的实现而贡献出各自的力量。
    刘宁一说：印度支那和平的恢复，首先是印度支那人民为自己民族的独立解放而长时期进行英勇斗争的结果。事实证明：觉醒了的、决心争取独立自由与和平的民族是不可战胜的，因为他们受到全世界人民的同情和支持。
    印度支那三国都是我国的邻邦，他们的获得和平与独立，我国人民衷心地予以庆祝。我国人民与工人阶级将更加鼓舞奋发，今后我们一定要更好地为实现国家的社会主义工业化和社会主义改造，为贯彻国家过渡时期总任务而努力。同时必须继续提高警惕，防止美帝国主义任何阴谋活动，为反对美帝国主义者的实力政策，为解放台湾，为维护和巩固世界持久和平而奋斗。
    李德全说：全世界人民所密切关心的印度支那停战和恢复和平的问题，已经在日内瓦会议上达成协议，这是全世界爱好和平的人民在缓和国际紧张局势，争取世界和平事业中的一个重大胜利！这一胜利大大有助于保障印度支那和全亚洲、全世界人民和妇女儿童的和平生活。我代表全中国妇女完全同意和支持这些协议，我们要和全国人民一道，争取这一协议的彻底实现，努力维护和巩固世界和平。
    吴晗说：我国青年对于日内瓦会议的重大成就，感到欢欣鼓舞。我国青年完全拥护和支持日内瓦会议关于印度支那问题的协议，并决心和我国人民在一起，为争取这些协议彻底实现，为保卫亚洲与全世界和平作进一步的努力。
    我国青年将在自己的岗位上，以积极工作，努力学习，锻炼身体，把自己锻炼成为祖国的优秀的建设者和保卫者，这样来增强保卫亚洲与世界和平的力量，警惕任何破坏和平的阴谋，更好地建设我们伟大的社会主义社会。
    茅盾说：日内瓦会议的成功，再一次证明了和平力量的强大，证明了以苏联为首的和平民主阵营的一贯的和平政策是符合于世界人民的利益的。日内瓦会议，为亚洲的集体和平与安全开拓了光明的远景；为国际局势的缓和取得了进一步的成就。
    和全国人民一道，我们，文学艺术工作者们，对于日内瓦会议的胜利成功感到万分兴奋。参加日内瓦会议的以周恩来总理兼外长为首的我国代表团，在整个会议过程中本着我国一贯的和平外交政策和中国人民的和平意志所作的不懈努力，以及对于世界和平的卓越贡献，业已博得了全世界人民的赞扬。对于我国代表团的这种伟大的成就，我们谨致以最崇高的敬意。
    我们文学艺术界的一切同志，誓必和全国人民一道，努力服务于祖国的建设。我们愿和亚洲和全世界爱好和平的文学艺术工作者一道，为揭露战争贩子们的阴谋，为保卫世界和平，而亲密团结，互相努力。
    李四光说：作为科学工作者，我们对充实保卫和平力量的工作，是有重大责任的，也是能够提供重要贡献的。首先我们必须献出我们一切的力量，对我国总路线的实施、国家社会主义工业化和提高科学技术水平上作出最大的努力。同时也要团结全世界的科学家，以维护世界和平，以科学为人类幸福服务为我们共同的奋斗目标，像苏联优越的科学家和工程师们所作的崇高贡献，把原子能用在和平建设事业那样。这样，我们相信，和平的力量必然日益壮大起来。日内瓦会议的成就，对我们这方面的努力正好为我们提供了有利的条件。
    梁希说：印度支那和平的恢复，不仅是印度支那人民的深切愿望，同时也是亚洲及全世界爱好和平人民的共同要求。中国科学工作者深知和平的可贵，因为要让科学能得到发展，要让广大劳动人民享受到科学的利益，也只有在和平的环境里才有可能。我们科学工作者，和全国人民一起，将再接再厉，支持这个协议的彻底执行，为反对新的战争危险，保卫亚洲及世界和平而努力。
    沙千里说：我们全国工商界在庆祝印度支那停战和恢复和平的时候，在庆祝我国代表团对于解决国际重大问题所作出的辉煌贡献的时候，要更紧密地团结在中国共产党、毛主席的周围和领导下积极经营，努力生产，把我国建设成为一个更强大的国家，为反对战争阴谋，争取持久和平而奋斗到底。
    会议最后一致通过了首都各界庆祝印度支那停战大会的决议。
    会议结束时，全场长久地鼓掌，为印度支那停战和恢复和平问题达成协议的胜利、为以苏联为首的和平民主社会主义阵营的和平外交政策的胜利、为中华人民共和国国际威望的大大提高而欢欣鼓舞。
