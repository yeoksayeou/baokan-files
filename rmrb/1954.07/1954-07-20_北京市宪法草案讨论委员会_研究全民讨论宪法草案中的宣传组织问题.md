The Beijing Municipal Constitution Draft Discussion Committee

Studies Publicity and Organization Issues in the National Discussion of the Draft Constitution

The Beijing Municipal Constitution Draft Discussion Committee held a meeting of the directors of the branch offices on the 15th, focusing on the issues of conducting a national discussion of the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China and further deepening publicity.

The publicity and discussion activities for the Beijing Municipal Constitution Draft have been fully launched. Large state-owned factories and mines started earlier, and the first phase of publicity is nearing completion. People from all walks of life in the city have shown a high degree of political enthusiasm in the publicity and discussion. The meeting believed that in the future, in addition to continuing to report on the draft constitution to people from all walks of life, special attention should be paid to fully promoting democracy and, on the principle of voluntariness, organizing the masses to discuss the draft constitution and submit their opinions for amendment and supplementation to the draft constitution. At the same time, the national discussion itself is a profound and vivid democratic education for the masses. The meeting requested that cadres, intellectuals, engineers, and technicians conduct chapter-by-chapter and article-by-article discussions; people from other walks of life can conduct focused discussions in light of their own circumstances. Discussions among workers can be conducted in the form of reading groups, and other walks of life can adopt appropriate methods. In order to facilitate the people to put forward opinions on the draft constitution, opinion boxes should be set up in larger streets or alleys throughout the city.

The meeting believed that after the first phase of publicity on the draft constitution in major state-owned factories and mines, various forms such as reading groups, blackboards, and broadcasts must be used to deepen publicity and discussion; and attention should be paid to summarizing the gains of publicity and discussion of the draft constitution, guiding the political enthusiasm of employees to production, promoting the production competition movement centered on technological innovation, and welcoming the convening of the Municipal People's Congress and the National People's Congress.

    北京市宪法草案讨论委员会
    研究全民讨论宪法草案中的宣传组织问题
    北京市宪法草案讨论委员会十五日召开各分会办公室主任会议，着重研究了对中华人民共和国宪法草案进行全民讨论与进一步深入宣传的问题。
    北京市宪法草案的宣传和讨论活动已全面展开。各大型国营厂矿企业开始较早，现第一阶段的宣传即将结束。全市各阶层人民在宣传和讨论中，表现了高度的政治热情。会议认为今后除继续向各阶层人民进行宪法草案的报告外，应特别注意充分发扬民主，在自愿的原则下，组织人民群众对宪法草案进行讨论，使其提出对宪法草案的修正和补充意见。同时，全民讨论的本身，就是对群众深刻的生动的民主教育。会议要求，干部、知识分子、工程技术人员，要逐章逐条进行讨论；其他各界人民可结合其本身情况有重点地进行讨论。工人中的讨论可通过读报小组的形式进行，其他各阶层可采取适当的方式进行。为便于人民群众对宪法草案提出意见，全市较大的街道或胡同都要设立意见箱。
    会议认为，国营各大厂矿对宪法草案的第一阶段宣传结束后，必须通过读报组、黑板报、广播等各种形式，使宣传和讨论深入一步；并注意总结宣传和讨论宪法草案的收获，把职工的政治热情引导到生产上去，推进以技术革新为中心的生产竞赛运动，迎接市人民代表大会会议和全国人民代表大会会议的召开。　（新华社）
