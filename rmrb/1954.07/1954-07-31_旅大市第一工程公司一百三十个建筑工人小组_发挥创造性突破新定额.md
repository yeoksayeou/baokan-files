Since the Dalian First Construction Engineering Company announced the new quotas in mid-May, one hundred and thirty groups have exceeded the new quotas by early July. The new quotas are on average 22% higher than last year's quotas, but they have exceeded the new quotas by an average of 20%.

After the new quotas were announced, these groups brought into play their labor enthusiasm and creativity, put forward many rationalization proposals, and promoted 26 kinds of advanced experiences and 42 kinds of advanced tools. The window sash liner created by carpenter Qu Wansheng not only ensured the quality of the window frame scribing but also improved labor productivity tenfold. In the past, a Grade 1 worker could only scribe 400 window frames a day, but now an apprentice can scribe 4,500 window frames a day using the liner. The bricklaying group of Yu Xuezhu actively promoted the "five stretchers and one header" bricklaying method, exceeding the new quota for brick walls by more than 40%. The carpenter group of Zheng Yuanji did not pay attention to learning advanced experience before the new quotas were announced, and often failed to complete the quotas. After the new quotas were announced, they learned the method of "division of labor according to work procedures, fixing work procedures and assigning responsibilities," exceeding the new quotas by 10%. The stonemasonry group of Liu Shoushan promoted the advanced stonemasonry method, with each person averaging 4.36 square meters per day, exceeding the new quota by 33.3%. The groups that broke through the new quotas not only accelerated the progress of the project, but also increased their wage income accordingly.

    旅大市第一工程公司一百三十个建筑工人小组
    发挥创造性突破新定额
    旅大市第一建筑工程公司自五月中旬新定额公布后，到七月初已有一百三十个小组突破了新定额。新定额比去年的定额平均提高百分之二十二以上，但他们又平均超过新定额百分之二十。
    这些小组在新定额公布以后，发挥了劳动积极性和创造性，提出了许多合理化建议，推行了二十六种先进经验、四十二种先进工具。木工小组工人曲万升所创造的窗扇卡线器，不仅保证了划窗框的质量，而且能提高劳动生产效率十倍。过去一级工人每天才能划四百个窗框，现在一个徒工用卡线器，每天能划出四千五百个窗框。于学珠砌砖小组积极推行了“五顺一丁”砌砖法，砌砖墙超过新定额百分之四十以上。郑元吉木工小组，在新定额公布以前，没有注意学习先进经验，经常不能完成定额。新定额公布以后，他们学习了“按工序分工，固定工序专责”法，超过新定额百分之十。刘守山砌石小组推广了先进砌石法，每人每天平均砌四点三六平方公尺，超过新定额百分之三十三点三。突破了新定额的小组，不仅加速了工程进度，工资收入也随着增加了。
