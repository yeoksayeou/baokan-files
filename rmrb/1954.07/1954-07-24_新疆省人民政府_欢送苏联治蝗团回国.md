    The Xinjiang Provincial People's Government held a farewell meeting on July 13th for the staff of the Soviet locust control team returning home. Over 600 people attended the farewell meeting, including Wang Enmao, First Secretary of the Xinjiang Branch of the CPC Central Committee, and Gao Jinchun, Vice Chairman of the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government. The head of the Soviet locust control team, Tsiplenkov, the deputy head, Olenin, and all 45 staff members attended the farewell meeting. Roshev, Acting Deputy Consul and Ivanov, Deputy Consul of the Soviet Consulate General in Urumqi, and Kavalerov, Consul of the Consulate in Altay, also attended the farewell meeting.

    At the meeting, more than 40 Young Pioneers from Urumqi presented flowers to all the staff of the Soviet locust control team. Gao Jinchun presented a banner to the Soviet locust control team on behalf of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government and the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government and delivered a farewell speech. He said: Last year, the locust control work in Xinjiang Province achieved great success with the help of the Soviet locust control team. This year, the Soviet locust control team has helped the people of Xinjiang to control locusts on more than 1.22 million mu of land, laying a good foundation for the complete eradication of locust plagues in the future. He expressed his respect for the high internationalist spirit and serious and responsible work spirit of all the staff of the Soviet locust control team. The head of the Soviet locust control team, Tsiplenkov, and the Acting Deputy Consul of the Soviet Consulate General in Urumqi, Roshev, both spoke. Tsiplenkov said: In the locust control work, they received the care and support of the Xinjiang Provincial Party Committee and Government, as well as the close cooperation of the people of all ethnic groups and locust control cadres in Xinjiang Province, which enabled the locust control work to be successfully completed. He congratulated the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang Province on their greater victories in various economic constructions.

    A banquet and evening party were also held on the same day.

    After more than two months of effort, all the staff of the Soviet locust control team completed the locust control work in early July. Now, except for Tsiplenkov, the head of the locust control team, and four entomologists who will temporarily stay in Xinjiang to continue investigating the distribution of remaining locusts and locust eggs and make plans for locust control next year, the remaining personnel will soon return home.
