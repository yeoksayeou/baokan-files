A Women's Survey Team Active at the Foot of the Qilian Mountains

　　In the Jiuquan Basin of Northwest China, rich oil deposits are hidden. Its southern part is the Qilian Mountains, covered with snow all year round, and the northern part leans against the Heli Mountains. The terrain is complex, the population is sparse, and the daily climate changes greatly. A newly established, young women's survey team (One-Four-Zero-Three Women's Traverse Team) is here surveying the oil resources for the motherland.

    At dawn, the first thing the surveying team members do is prepare the day's dry rations and fill each water bottle.
    Yu Zhie (left), the young women's survey team leader, and Zhang Meixin (right), a surveyor, are measuring the terrain.
    The surveying team members are not afraid of hardship and climb mountains and ridges to measure the terrain.
    The surveying team members carefully draw blueprints inside the tent to provide to the exploration team for their work.

    活跃在祁连山下的一支女子测量队
    在我国西北酒泉盆地，蕴藏着丰富的石油。它的南部是终年积雪的祁连山，北倚合黎山脉，地势复杂，人烟稀少，每日气候变化很大。一支新成立的、年轻的女子测量队（一——四零三女子导线队）就在这里为祖国勘测石油资源。

    黎明起来，测量队员第一件事就是准备一天的干粮和灌满每一个水壶。

    测量队员们不怕艰苦，爬山越岭去测量地形。
