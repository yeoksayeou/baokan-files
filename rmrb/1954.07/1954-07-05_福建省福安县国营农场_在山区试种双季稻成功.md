    Fujian Province, Fu'an County State-Owned Farm
    Successfully Trials Double-Cropping Rice in Mountainous Areas
    The state-owned farm in the Ninth District of Fu'an County, Fujian Province, has successfully trialed double-cropping rice in a mountainous area. The Ninth District is a mountainous area with high mountains, barren land, and a cold climate. Local farmers have historically only grown single-season rice, with a yield of only about two hundred catties per mu. After the establishment of the farm in 1952, it analyzed the reasons why local farmers were unwilling to grow double-cropping rice. It adopted methods such as early plowing, deep plowing, soil improvement, and cutting down rocky grass, and trialed sixteen mu of double-cropping rice. In the autumn, the average yield was 669 catties per mu. In 1953, the farm trialed another thirty-six mu of double-cropping rice. Although threatened by a sixty-day drought, the average yield per mu still increased by twenty-eight catties compared to 1952. More than five mu even achieved a high yield of 919 catties per mu. Due to the farm's successive harvests of double-cropping rice, this year, twenty mutual aid teams in seven nearby townships planted sixty-six mu of double-cropping rice, and the farm also planted forty-two mu.

    福建省福安县国营农场
    在山区试种双季稻成功
    福建省福安县九区国营农场在山区试种双季稻成功。九区是个山区，山高地瘦，气候寒冷，当地农民历年都是种单季稻，每亩产量只有二百斤左右。一九五二年该农场成立后，分析研究了当地农民不愿种双季稻的原因，采用早耕、深耕、改良土壤、砍光岩草等办法，试种十六亩双季稻。秋后平均每亩产六百六十九斤。一九五三年，该场又试种了三十六亩双季稻，虽然经过六十天大旱灾的威胁，但平均每亩产量还比一九五二年增产二十八斤，其中有五亩多还创造了每亩九百一十九斤高额产量。由于农场的双季稻年年丰收，今年附近七个乡二十个互助组就栽种了六十六亩双季稻，农场也种了四十二亩。（李子信）
