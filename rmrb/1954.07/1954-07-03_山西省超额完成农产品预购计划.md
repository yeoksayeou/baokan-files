    Shanxi Province has exceeded its agricultural product advance purchase plan. As of June 10th, supply and marketing cooperatives in the province had signed 357,544 advance purchase contracts with local agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and individual farmers, paying farmers 96,183.3 million yuan in advance purchase deposits. The advance purchase of grain, cotton, and oil-bearing crops all exceeded the original plan.

    The agricultural product advance purchase work has effectively guided and supported agricultural production, promoting the realization of the province's plans to expand the planting area of cotton and oil-bearing crops and increase grain production. In the advance purchase work, all regions generally helped farmers formulate or revise their production plans in accordance with national requirements. After the 64 agricultural production cooperatives and 84 mutual aid teams in Gujiao and other ten townships in Lingchuan County signed advance purchase contracts with the supply and marketing cooperatives, they increased the planting of oil-bearing crops by 417 mu through methods such as reclaiming wasteland, building terraced fields, and planting along embankments. In coordination with the advance purchase work, supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions supplied a large number of means of production and means of livelihood. According to statistics, about 70% of the deposits in the province have been used for production or are planned to be used for production.

    Currently, a few regions in the province that have not completed the advance purchase task are continuing to carry out the advance purchase work, and regions that have completed the task are actively reviewing and checking the advance purchase contracts and educating farmers on abiding by contract credit.

    山西省超额完成农产品预购计划
    山西省已超额完成农产品预购计划。截至六月十日，该省供销合作社已和各地农业生产合作社、互助组及个体农民签订预购合同三十五万七千五百四十四份，付给农民预购定金九百六十一亿八千三百三十万元，预购到的粮食、皮棉、油料都超过了原来的计划。
    通过农产品预购工作，有力地指导和扶植了农业生产，对全省扩大棉花、油料作物种植面积的计划和粮食增产计划的实现起了推动作用。各地在预购工作中，普遍按照国家要求帮助农民制订或修订了生产计划。陵川县古交等十个乡的六十四个农业生产合作社、八十四个互助组和供销合作社订立预购合同以后，用开熟荒、修滩田、边堰插种等方法增植了油料作物四百一十七亩。配合预购工作，各地供销合作社供应了大批生产资料和生活资料。据统计，全省约百分之七十左右的定金已用于生产或计划用于生产。
    目前，该省少数没有完成预购任务的地区仍在继续进行预购工作，已经完成任务的地区正在积极复核和检查预购合同，并对农民进行遵守合同信用的教育。
