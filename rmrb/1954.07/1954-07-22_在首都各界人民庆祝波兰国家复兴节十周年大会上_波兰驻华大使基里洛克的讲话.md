Mr. Chairman, Honorable Ambassadors, Dear Comrades and Friends:

    On behalf of the government of the Polish People's Republic and myself, I express my gratitude to the Chairman of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, the Honorable Ambassadors, and all the guests present tonight.
    On the eve of the tenth anniversary of the National Rebirth Day of the People's Poland, a moment of such great significance to our people, I feel immensely honored to be able to address this rally, which commemorates the historic victory of the Polish people's struggle against Hitler's fascism and domestic reactionaries, and celebrates our country's achievements over the past ten years since the war.
    Ten years ago, my motherland was still engulfed in war, suffering from the barbaric destruction of the occupiers, enraged by their military defeats. It was at that time, in the unforgettable hot July of 1944, that the heroic Soviet liberators began their march across the devastated Polish territory, bringing us the long-awaited freedom.
    In the unequal and bloody struggle against the Hitlerite occupiers, our country persevered to the end. We placed our hopes on the East, from where the fraternal liberation army marched in unison. The newly formed Polish armed forces fought shoulder to shoulder with the glorious Soviet army.
    It has been ten years since workers and peasants have ruled Poland, and the political power in Poland has been in the hands of the workers and peasants, who were once oppressed and exploited by capitalists and landlords. Those gentlemen used to say that workers and peasants were born only to be fit for "menial labor" and could not govern the country. The result of the fraternal alliance of workers and peasants holding power for ten years has proven that the People's Government has emerged victorious from the test of history. In the thousand-year history of our country, never have so many significant events occurred as in the decade from 1944 to 1954. Initially, the People's Government found Poland to be poor, backward, and severely damaged by the war and the Hitlerite occupation. In these ten years, the People's Government has strived to consolidate the country's independence, restore Poland's territory, and promote friendship between the motherland and peace-loving people. Its achievements in all aspects far surpass those of previous generations. Poland is no longer the object of exploitation by foreign capitalists, nor is it an economic base for imperialist countries. Thanks to the implementation of the Three-Year Plan and the Six-Year Plan, we have basically overcome the backwardness left over from capitalist society, and our country has transformed into an industrial-agricultural nation. The industrial output in 1953 was 3.6 times that of 1938, and in 1938, Poland was still an industrially backward country in Europe. In 1953, Poland's total industrial output ranked fifth in Europe. In 1953, Poland's agricultural output, calculated per capita, increased by 30 percent compared to 1938. The socialist component in agriculture accounted for more than 40 percent of the total agricultural commodity output.

    It should also be pointed out that the socialist component in total industrial output reached 99 percent last year.

    在首都各界人民庆祝波兰国家复兴节十周年大会上
    波兰驻华大使基里洛克的讲话主席先生、各位大使先生、亲爱的同志们、朋友们：
    我代表波兰人民共和国政府和我本人，向中华人民共和国中央人民政府主席、各位大使先生和今夜到会的来宾表示谢意。
    际兹人民波兰国家复兴节十周年纪念的前夕，这样一个对我国人民具有如此重大意义的时刻，承诸位来宾参加这一纪念波兰人民反希特勒法西斯主义和国内反动分子的斗争的历史性的胜利，并欢庆战后十年来我国的成就的大会，我能在这里致辞，感到无限的光荣。
    十年前，我的祖国仍是战火弥漫，它遭受到因战事失利而恼羞成怒的占领者的野蛮的破坏。就在那个时候，在那难忘的一九四四年炎热的七月里，英勇的苏联解放者，在备受蹂躏的波兰的国土上开始进军，给我们带来了渴望已久的自由。
    在反希特勒占领者的众寡悬殊的流血斗争中，我国是坚持到底的。我们将希望寄托在东方，兄弟般的解放军就从那里齐步前进，波兰新建的武装部队与光荣的苏军一道，曾并肩作过了战。
    工人和农民统治波兰已十年了，波兰的政权已掌握在过去备受资本家和地主压迫剥削的工人和农民手里。那些大人先生们曾经这样说：工人和农民生来就只配“作下贱的工作”，不能治理国家。十年来，兄弟般的工农联盟掌握政权的结果，说明了人民政府已在历史的考验上获得了胜利。在我国千年来的历史上，从没有像一九四四年至一九五四年这十年间产生过那么多的重大的事件。最初，人民政府发现波兰既贫穷，又落后，并且受到了战争和希特勒占领者的严重破坏。在这十年间，人民政权努力巩固国家的独立、恢复波兰的版图，并促进祖国与爱好和平的人民之间的友谊，它在各方面的成就上，远胜过前代。波兰已不再是外国资本家剥削的对象，不再是帝国主义国家的经济基地了。由于三年计划和六年计划的实施，我们基本上克服了资本主义社会遗留下来的落后情况，我国已改变为工业农业国。一九五三年的工业产量为一九三八年的三·六倍，而在一九三八年，波兰还是欧洲的一个工业落后的国家。一九五三年工业总产量在欧洲已占第五位。一九五三年波兰的农业产量按照每一人口计算，较一九三八年增加了百分之三十。农业方面的社会主义成分，在农业商品总产量中，占到百分之四十以上。
    还应指出：工业总产量中的社会主义成分，在去年已达到百分之九十九。
