To the Warrior of Peace - Poet Neruda

Wang Yaping

To welcome the dawn, I rise very early. I see the red sunlight of the East, peeking through the shimmering green leaves of the poplars, quietly, as always, climbing onto my windowsill. At this moment, my heart is like a windless sea, looking at the bright Beijing, filled with indescribable joy; but "Lumberjacks, Awake!" this steel-like resounding poem, once again powerfully impacts my passionate heart. Pablo Neruda! I cannot but connect your name with verses full of fighting power, I cannot but connect your poems with the people of Chile and the people of China, because we have a common desire for peace, forever inseparable!

In the dimly lit black forests of the Americas, in the long and narrow land of Chile, crisscrossed by mountains and rivers, you spent days of hunger, hardship, and without sunlight, you constantly sent out songs of protest, and constantly suffered persecution. For fifty years, you have been like a sturdy pine tree covered by ice and snow, standing tall among the Chilean people, all rulers who wield knives cannot shake you, and your thick roots are even more firmly rooted in the mud.

For fifty years, you have traveled the lands of Europe and Asia, you tirelessly sing of struggle, and the struggling people welcome you; for fifty years, you have been like a red star on the road to peace, your magnificent poems shining with extraordinary brilliance. You and I, we and the entire Chilean people, all cherish the fifty years you have lived; you and I, we and the progressive people of the world, all commemorate the contributions you have made to peace.

For fifty years, the increasingly powerful proletariat has long grasped the fate of mankind and become the master of time; Pablo Neruda! In these advancing years, you have sung real songs and dedicated your sincere heart.

Today, on the occasion of your glorious fiftieth birthday, I have no better gift to give you; I can only bless you with the deeply meaningful words "He is a warrior, and also a poet!"—a strong warrior of peace!

Today, I stand in a bright window in Beijing, I cannot rush to your side to raise a celebratory glass; I only hope that you create more poems for peace, I only hope that you live another fifty years and see the realization of the ideals of all mankind!

    给和平战士——诗人聂鲁达
    王亚平为了迎接黎明，我起得很早，我看到东方刚刚发红的阳光，透过闪着青光的白杨叶子，悄悄地也是照例地爬上我的窗台。这时候，我底心灵像无风的大海，望着明丽的北京，有说不出的愉快；但“伐木者，醒来吧！”这钢铁般震响的诗篇，又一次强烈地冲激着我热情的胸怀。巴勃罗·聂鲁达！我不能不把你的名字和充满了战斗力量的诗句联结在一起，我不能不把你的诗，和智利人民、中国人民联结在一起，因为我们有着共同的和平的愿望，永远分解不开！在美洲闪着幽光的黑森林下，在智利纵横着山河的狭长地带，你渡过了饥饿、困苦、没有阳光的日子，你不断地发出抗议的歌声，也不断地受着迫害。五十年，你像一棵被冰雪掩盖着的屹立在智利人民当中的坚挺的松柏，一切执着屠刀的统治者，都不能动摇你，你那粗壮的根株却更牢固地扎在泥层里。五十年，你走遍了欧洲、亚洲的土地，你不息地歌唱战斗，战斗的人民欢迎你；五十年，你像和平大路上的一颗红星，你的宏伟的诗篇，闪着异样的光彩。我和你，我们和智利的全体人民，谁都要珍惜你走过的五十个年头；我和你，我们和全世界进步的人民，谁都要纪念你为和平创造的功绩。五十年，日益壮大的无产阶级，早已掌握了人类的命运，做了时间的主人；巴勃罗·聂鲁达！在这前进的岁月里，你唱着真实的歌，献出了真诚的心。今天，欣逢你光辉的五十寿辰，我没有更好的礼品馈赠你；我只能拿“是战士，也是诗人！”这一句含着深挚意义的话祝福你——坚强的和平战士！今天，我站在北京一个明丽的楼窗下，我不能驰奔到你面前同举庆贺的酒杯；我只望你为和平创造更多的诗篇，我只望你再活五十年，看到全人类理想的实现！
