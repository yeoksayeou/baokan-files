People's Banks in various parts of Shaanxi Province began collecting agricultural loans that were due in the summer after the farmers finished their intense summer harvest work. According to incomplete statistics, from mid-June to the end of June, the province had recovered more than 9 billion yuan in overdue loans. The Liquan branch of the People's Bank recovered more than 1.22 billion yuan in overdue loans, accounting for more than 79% of the total amount of agricultural loans due in the county in the third quarter. In the Wayaotou Township of the first district of Fuping County, the recovered loans have reached more than 95% of the total amount due.

After the bumper harvest, farmers are very enthusiastic about repaying overdue loans. Yu Qingquan, a farmer from Huijiagou in the tenth township of the fourth district of Liquan County, borrowed 300,000 yuan before the summer harvest to buy a stone roller. As soon as the threshing ground was finished, he sold wheat to repay the loan first. He said, "The government uses loans to help us solve the difficulties in production and life. This year's wheat has another bumper harvest, so do we need the government to urge us to repay the loan?" The members of the credit cooperative in Wangdian Township, the first district of the county, paid off all kinds of loans of 27 million yuan that had not yet matured in one lump sum after the summer harvest.

    陕西省各地丰收农民
    踊跃归还到期贷款
    陕西省各地人民银行当农民结束紧张的夏收工作以后，就开始了夏季到期农业贷款的回收工作。据不完全统计，从六月中旬到六月底止，全省已收回到期贷款九十多亿元。人民银行醴泉支行共收回到期贷款十二亿二千多万元，占该县第三季度应收回的到期农业贷款总数的百分之七十九强；富平县一区瓦窑头乡收回的贷款已达应收总数的百分之九十五以上。
    丰收后的农民对归还到期贷款甚为踊跃。醴泉县四区十乡惠家沟农民于清泉，夏收前贷了三十万元买了一个碌碡，场刚碾罢，他就先卖麦子还了贷款。他说：“政府用贷款帮助我们解决生产和生活中的困难，今年麦子又丰收了，还款还要政府催吗。”该县一区王店乡信用合作社的社员们，在夏收后，一次就还清了尚未到期的各种贷款两千七百万元。
