    CCP Branches in Rural Xishui County, Hubei Province
    Universally Establish a Regular Party Class Education System
    The Communist Party branches in the rural areas of Xishui County, Hubei Province, have universally established a regular party class system. Out of the county's one hundred and fifty-four party branches, one hundred and forty-nine have stipulated strict learning systems and learning plans since March of this year. More than 1,600 party members and more than 900 non-party activists participated in the study. So far, each branch has generally attended five to six party classes. The eight party branches in the Ninth District also invited Sheng Yongzhong, the Communist Party member and director of the Mingxing Agricultural Production Cooperative who had visited the Daye Steel Plant, to report on his experiences and feelings about visiting the factory.
    After the study, the ideological level of the party members has been greatly improved, and they understand the truth that only the working class can lead the revolution to victory, and their thinking on the worker-peasant alliance has been strengthened, so their work has become more active. According to statistics, more than 400 Communist Party members in the county participated in mutual aid and cooperation organizations during this period. Among them, more than 300 people were elected as chairmen, vice-chairmen, committee members of agricultural production cooperatives, and heads and deputy heads of mutual aid groups. Through study, the democratic style and unity within the branches have also been greatly strengthened. Some Communist Party members in Maoling, Yanmao, and Wanlong townships in the Xima District used to be arrogant and unwilling to accept criticism. After studying the resolutions of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the CPC and other documents in party classes, this mood began to change. Li Jiuru, a Communist Party member in Maling Township, said: I used to think that others' criticisms of me were biased, and I was not happy to listen. Now I realize that this idea is very dangerous.
    Many non-Party activists have also greatly improved their ideological level after participating in the study, and they have requested to join the Communist Party. Since the establishment of the branch's regular education system, twenty-three active farmers in the county have joined the Communist Party of China. Li Congming and Zhu Yuanxian, members of the Communist Youth League in Hedong Township, were originally activists in the land reform. After the land reform, they had the incorrect idea of only seeking personal wealth and not wanting to participate in work. After studying the general line and listening to party classes, they criticized their wrong ideas, and their work became active again. Now, they have joined the Communist Party of China. Li Congming was recently elected as the secretary of the Hedong Township branch of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League. The perennial mutual aid group led by Zhu Yuanxian is preparing to upgrade to an agricultural production cooperative after this autumn. (Xinhua News Agency)

    湖北浠水县农村中的中共支部
    普遍建立了经常上党课的教育制度
    湖北省浠水县农村中的共产党支部已普遍建立了经常的上党课制度。全县一百五十四个党支部中，已有一百四十九个支部从今年三月起就规定了严格的学习制度和学习计划，参加学习的有一千六百多名党员和九百多名非党积极分子。到现在为止，各支部已普遍上了五次到六次党课。第九区的八个党支部，还请了参观过大冶钢厂的明星农业生产合作社社长、共产党员盛咏中报告参观工厂的见闻和感想。
    经过学习以后，党员的思想水平已有很大提高，明白了只有工人阶级才能领导革命走向胜利的真理，加强了工农联盟的思想，因此工作都更加积极起来。据统计，全县在这一时期有四百多名共产党员参加了互助合作组织。其中有三百多人被选为农业生产合作社的正、副社长、社务委员和正、副互助组长。经过学习，各支部内部的民主作风和团结也大大加强。洗马区毛岭、燕毛、万垅等乡的有些共产党员，过去有骄傲情绪，不愿受人批评，在上党课时学习了中共七届四中全会决议等文件后，这种情绪开始有了改变。马岭乡的共产党员李玖如说：原先我认为别人对我批评是心怀偏见，不高兴听，现在才认识到这种想法是非常危险的。
    许多非党积极分子参加学习后，思想水平也有很大提高，纷纷要求加入共产党。从建立支部经常教育制度以来，全县已有二十三个农民积极分子加入了中国共产党。河东乡青年团员李聪明、朱远贤原是土地改革中的积极分子，土改后曾产生了只图个人发财不愿参加工作的不正确思想。他们在学习总路线和听党课以后，批判了自己的错误思想，工作重新积极起来。现在，他们已加入了中国共产党。李聪明不久前被选为中国新民主主义青年团河东乡支部的书记。朱远贤领导的常年互助组准备在今年秋后提高为农业生产合作社。（新华社）
