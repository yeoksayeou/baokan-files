Strengthen Patriotic and Law-Abiding Education for Private Industrial and Commercial Businessmen

    Since the end of 1953, through the study of the general task of the state during the transition period, more private industrial and commercial businessmen have enhanced their ideological understanding, clearly seen the bright future of the country and themselves, and are willing to embark on the road of state capitalism. According to statistics from major and medium-sized cities, in private large-scale industries, in addition to the vast majority already being engaged in processing and ordering for the state, or their products being purchased and marketed by the state, the number of enterprises applying for joint state-private ownership has been increasing daily. In private commerce, many industries also purchase goods from the state in bulk, or purchase, sell, and distribute various commodities on behalf of the state. These enterprises, which have already transformed into various forms of state capitalism, can actively engage in legitimate production and operation under the management of state administrative organs, the leadership of the state-owned economy, and the supervision of the masses of workers.
    However, there is still a considerable portion of private industrial and commercial businessmen who do not understand the greater good and continue to engage in illegal activities that harm the interests of the country and the people. Many private industrial and commercial businessmen are not actively engaged in improving the production and management of their enterprises, and better playing the positive role of private industry and commerce in benefiting the national economy and the people's livelihood, but instead hold a negative attitude towards operation. Some use various methods to withdraw funds, such as advance dividends, supplementary dividends, long-term expenses, repayment of advances, and treating employees to eating, drinking, and entertainment; others use production funds to purchase consumer goods, arbitrarily squandering and wasting them, regardless of production and operation. This negative thinking and practice have already produced extremely adverse consequences. The production of some private enterprises has begun to decline, especially the rate of substandard and defective products has increased significantly. According to statistics from Guangzhou, the average rate of substandard products in the city's knitting industry in the first quarter of this year has reached 30 percent, with some reaching as high as 60 percent. In January and February alone, there were more than 500,000 substandard undershirts and socks. This negative business thinking and destructive practices are completely wrong. If it is allowed to continue to develop, it will not only waste useful funds and raw materials in vain, but also, due to reduced funds, reduced production, and increased substandard and defective products, the production and operation of the enterprises will not be sustainable. It will reduce the supply of social materials and increase unemployed workers, affecting the people's lives and the country's economic construction. This is clearly detrimental to the interests of the country and the people.
    There are also some private industrial and commercial businessmen who, although educated through the great "Five-Anti" movement, are still continuing to engage in "five poisons" criminal activities. The facts of illegal and criminal activities of some private rubber manufacturers in Tianjin in processing and manufacturing military rubber shoes for the Volunteer Army, published in today's newspaper, are a clear example. This group of private rubber manufacturers, in order to pursue illegal profits, were so mad that they regarded the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea as a good opportunity to make a fortune. In the process of processing and manufacturing military rubber shoes for the Volunteer Army, they blatantly cut corners, stole and replaced good materials from the military, altered specifications, produced shoddy goods, falsely reported costs, and concealed leftover materials, causing huge losses of more than 8 billion yuan to the state. They verbally talked about complying with laws and opposing the "five poisons," but in fact continued to engage in criminal activities during the "Five-Anti" period, seriously undermining the state's policies and laws.
    The incident of illegal capitalists continuing to implement the "five poisons" after the "Five-Anti" is not an isolated or accidental one. According to surveys and statistics from various regions, such illegal and criminal behavior had once decreased after the "Five-Anti" movement, but has since been increasing year by year. Since 1953, in addition to many private industrial and commercial businessmen taking advantage of various opportunities to engage in speculation and profiteering, disrupting the market, tax evasion, cutting corners, theft of state property, theft of state economic intelligence, and bribery to corrupt cadres have also been serious criminal acts. In March and April of this year, Tianjin focused on inspecting 17 large, medium, and small factories in the machine cast iron industry and a Xinyie abrasive wheel factory in eight districts, and found that all of them had "five poisons" behaviors, with the Xinyie abrasive wheel factory being the most serious. The factory's turnover in 1953 was 1.8 billion yuan, while illegal profits reached 1.4 billion yuan. The factory's capitalist, Wang Kun, had consistently bribed and corrupted state cadres before and after the "Five-Anti," and tried every means to buy over and win over employees, giving them money, gifts, increasing wages, lavishly eating and drinking, and playing with dancing girls. Spending on eating, drinking, and entertainment for employees alone amounted to more than 100 million yuan. More seriously, there are also a very small number of illegal capitalists who not only resist the state's restrictions and transformation economically, but have also developed to engage in political sabotage activities. Recently, in individual places such as Tianjin and Shanghai, it has been discovered that some illegal capitalists intentionally damaged production equipment in order to resist the state's processing orders and undermine joint state-private ownership. There are also individual illegal capitalists who collude with U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek secret service agencies to conspire to carry out counter-revolutionary espionage activities. Although this situation is very rare, it is very serious and deserves the high vigilance of the people throughout the country and patriotic industrialists and businessmen.
    In order to correctly play the positive role of private industry and commerce in benefiting the national economy and the people's livelihood in the future, prevent and overcome its negative role in harming the national economy and the people's livelihood, and gradually guide private industry and commerce onto the road of state capitalism, local industrial and commercial administrative departments, relevant state-owned enterprises, and party organizations and trade unions in private enterprises must, in conjunction with the study of the general task of the state during the transition period, especially in conjunction with the study of the draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China, strengthen patriotic and law-abiding education for private industrial and commercial businessmen.
    This first requires these state organs, state-owned enterprises, and party organizations and trade unions in private enterprises, in addition to actively leading and helping private industrial and commercial businessmen to improve production and management, to also educate private industrial and commercial businessmen through their daily work. They must make them realize that the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce by the state not only conforms to the interests of the country and the people, but also takes into account the interests of private industrial and commercial businessmen. Every patriotic industrial and commercial businessman, as long as he is willing to obey the management of state administrative organs, accept the leadership of the state-owned economy, respect the supervision of the masses of workers, actively engage in legitimate production and operation, and move forward in the direction pointed out by the state, can gain the trust of the state and the people. Today they can obtain reasonable profits, and in the future they will also have appropriate work to do. Their future will definitely be bright. Therefore, patriotism and law-abiding should be a minimum condition for private industrial and commercial businessmen to strive for transformation. Conversely, whoever is unwilling to do so, but wants to continue to treat the production and management of enterprises with a negative attitude, continue to engage in "five poisons" activities, especially engage in political sabotage activities, is abandoning himself to the state and the people.
    While carrying out the above-mentioned education, local industrial and commercial administrative departments and relevant state-owned enterprises, especially party organizations and trade unions in private enterprises, should also educate the masses of workers to raise their vigilance and mobilize them to strengthen supervision over capitalists. Every worker must realize that the illegal and criminal acts of illegal capitalists not only damage the interests of the country, but also damage the interests of the working class and the broad masses of the people, and must be resolutely opposed. In the future, whether in the general production and operation of private enterprises, or in their processing orders or purchasing and selling on behalf of the state, the masses of workers should supervise the capitalists to conduct legitimate production and operation. If they find that capitalists have speculative and opportunistic behaviors, or violate contracts, they should promptly advise and report them.
    As the propaganda and education of the general task of the state during the transition period becomes more widespread and in-depth, and as the superiority of state capitalist enterprises becomes increasingly apparent, more and more patriotic and law-abiding advanced figures willing to accept transformation will inevitably emerge among private industrial and commercial businessmen; but at the same time, a part of illegal capitalists will inevitably resolutely resist the state's policies of utilization, restriction, and transformation, and this struggle will inevitably become increasingly sharp and complex. Therefore, every state worker should maintain a high degree of vigilance and prevent and overcome the various illegal and criminal acts of illegal capitalists at all times and in all places. However, at present, both within our party and in state organs and state-owned enterprises, a part of people lack sufficient understanding of this point, and mistakenly believe that after the "Five-Anti" movement, illegal capitalists no longer dare to commit the "five poisons" crimes, so they lose the necessary vigilance when dealing with private merchants. This is not only reflected in the military rubber shoes processing process this time, but also exists in the currently large amount of processing and ordering work. Some staff members of state organs and state-owned enterprises, when ordering processing from private manufacturers, neither seriously investigate and understand the capital, machinery and equipment, technical conditions, and business credit of private manufacturers in advance, nor make efforts to study various issues related to processing orders, and blindly sign contracts with private merchants, paying too much advance deposit or payment, thus making the cost calculation inaccurate, and causing many problems in product specifications, quality, and delivery dates. There are also many perfunctory and careless phenomena in the acceptance of finished products. This makes illegal capitalists dare to act recklessly, engage in large-scale speculation and opportunism, cut corners and steal state property in large quantities. More seriously, there are also a small number of state workers who have been infected with the despicable bourgeois individualism and have colluded with illegal capitalists, becoming their agents for stealing and defrauding state property. Since the "Five-Anti" movement, the reason why some phenomena such as excessively high costs, unqualified products, failure to deliver goods on time, and private merchants misappropriating or stealing payments have still occurred in processing orders in various places is inseparable from the above-mentioned problems.
    In the future, all levels of state organs and state-owned enterprise departments must severely punish those staff members who cannot withstand the erosion of bourgeois ideology and degenerate, and at the same time, they must step up education to all state staff members, especially those who often deal with the bourgeoisie, so that they realize that: processing orders, unified purchase and sales, and purchasing and sales on behalf of are all forms of state capitalism. Through these various forms, the state can more effectively realize the policies of utilization, restriction, and transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, supervise private enterprises to improve business management, overcome the blindness and anarchy of private enterprise production, correctly play its positive role in benefiting the national economy and the people's livelihood, and prevent its negative role in harming the national economy and the people's livelihood. Therefore, all relevant state organs and state-owned enterprises must strengthen leadership and supervision when ordering processing from private merchants, entrusting them to purchase and sell on behalf of them, or purchasing and selling their products in a unified way. On the one hand, they must help them solve the difficulties in production and operation in accordance with the state's policies and laws; on the other hand, they should urge them to act in accordance with the contract, actively improve production and operation, and successfully complete the tasks assigned by the state. This work of leading and supervising the production and operation management of private enterprises is a major political responsibility entrusted to relevant organs and state-owned enterprises by the state. It is very wrong to ignore the major political significance of processing orders, unified purchase and sales, and purchase and sales on behalf of, and to think that it is just a simple transaction.
    The illegal and criminal acts of illegal capitalists harm the interests of the country and the people, and also tarnish the reputation of patriotic industrialists and businessmen. Opposing their illegal and criminal acts is not only a matter for party and government organs, state-owned enterprises, and the masses of workers, but also a matter for patriotic industrialists and businessmen. It is hoped that every patriotic industrialist and businessman will actively assist the people's government in carrying out patriotic and law-abiding education in private enterprises, and resolutely fight against those black sheep. This is a glorious task that patriotic industrialists and businessmen should undertake.

### 加强对私营工商业者的爱国守法教育

    加强对私营工商业者的爱国守法教育
    自从一九五三年年底以来，经过对国家过渡时期总任务的学习，私营工商业者中已有更多的人提高了思想认识，看清了国家和自己的光明前途，愿意走上国家资本主义的道路。根据各大中城市的统计，目前在私营的大型工业中，除绝大部分已为国家加工订货，或其产品由国家统购包销以外，申请公私合营的企业已日渐增多。在私营商业方面，也有许多行业向国家批购货物，或为国家代购、代销和经销各种商品。这些已经转变为各种形式的国家资本主义企业，有许多能在国家行政机关的管理、国营经济的领导和工人群众的监督下，积极地从事正当的生产和经营。
    但是，目前还有相当的一部分私营工商业者不明大义，继续干着危害国家和人民利益的非法活动。有许多私营工商业者不是积极地搞好企业的生产和经营管理，更好地发挥私营工商业有利于国计民生的积极作用，而是抱着消极的经营态度。有的采用各种办法抽走资金，例如提前分红、补发股息、长支、归还垫款以及请职工吃喝玩乐等；有的利用生产资金去购买消费品，任意挥霍浪费，不问生产和经营。这种消极的思想和作法，已经产生了极其不良的后果，有些私营企业的生产已开始下降，特别是次品和废品率显著增加。据广州市的统计，该市针织业今年第一季度的次货率平均已达百分之三十，有几家竟达百分之六十，仅一、二月份不合规格的汗衫和袜子就有五十万件以上。这种消极经营的思想和破坏性的作法是完全错误的，如果听任它继续发展下去，那就不仅会使有用的资金和原料白白地浪费掉，而且由于资金减少、生产减缩和次品废品增加，将会使企业的生产和营业不能维持，将会减少社会的物资供应和增加失业工人，影响人民的生活和国家的经济建设。这显然是损害国家和人民的利益的。
    还有一些私营工商业者，虽然经过伟大的“五反”运动的教育，但是仍然在继续从事“五毒”犯罪活动。今天本报发表的天津市部分私营橡胶厂商在为志愿军加工制造军用胶鞋中的违法犯罪事实，就是一个明显的例证。这批私营橡胶厂商为了追逐非法利润，竟至丧心病狂，把抗美援朝看作自己发横财的好机会，在给志愿军加工制造军用胶鞋的过程中大肆偷工减料，盗换军方好料，偷改规格，粗制滥造、虚报成本，隐瞒剩料，给国家造成八十多亿元的巨大损失。他们口里讲着遵守法令，反对
  “五毒”，实际上却在“五反”期间继续进行犯罪活动，严重地破坏了国家的政策法令。
    不法资本家在“五反”以后继续施行“五毒”的事件并不是个别的和偶然的。根据各地的调查统计，在“五反”运动以后，这种违法犯罪行为曾经一度减少，但以后又在逐年增加。一九五三年以来，私营工商业者中，除有许多人利用各种机会投机倒把，扰乱市场以外，偷税漏税、偷工减料、盗窃国家资财、盗窃国家经济情报、以行贿手段腐蚀干部等犯罪行为也是很严重的。今年三、四月间天津市重点检查了八区机器铸铁业的大、中、小十七个工厂和一家新业砂轮厂，发现全部都有“五毒”行为，其中以新业砂轮厂最为严重。该厂一九五三年的营业额共十八亿元，而非法利润竟达十四亿元。该厂资本家王昆在“五反”前后一贯行贿腐蚀国家干部，并多方收买拉拢职工，给他们送钱，送东西，增加工资，大吃大喝，玩舞女。仅请职工吃喝玩乐一项，就花费了一亿元以上。更为严重的是，还有极少数的不法资本家，不仅在经济上反抗国家的限制和改造，而且已发展到进行政治性的破坏活动。最近在天津、上海等个别地方，已发现有不法资本家为了抗拒国家的加工订货和破坏公私合营，竟至有意破坏生产设备。还有个别的不法资本家，和美蒋特务机关勾结起来，阴谋进行反革命的特务间谍活动。这种情况虽然是极个别的，但确是很严重的，值得引起全国人民和爱国工商业者的高度警惕。
    为了在今后正确发挥私营工商业有利于国计民生的积极作用，防止和克服它不利于国计民生的消极作用，并逐步引导私营工商业走上国家资本主义的道路，各地工商行政部门、有关的国营企业和私营企业中的党组织和工会必须结合对国家过渡时期总任务的学习，特别是结合对中华人民共和国宪法草案的学习，加强对私营工商业者的爱国守法教育。
    这首先是要求这些国家机关、国营企业和私营企业中的党组织和工会，除积极领导和帮助私营工商业者搞好生产和经营管理以外，还要通过日常的工作去教育私营工商业者，要使他们认识到国家对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，不但符合国家和人民的利益，而且也照顾到私营工商业者的利益。每一个爱国的工商业者，只要愿意服从国家行政机关的管理，接受国营经济的领导，尊重工人群众的监督，积极地从事正当的生产和经营，并按照国家指出的方向前进，就能获得国家和人民的信任，在今天有合理的利润可得，将来也有适当的工作可做，他们的前途就一定是光明的。因此，爱国守法应是私营工商业者争取改造的一个最起码的条件。相反的，谁如果不愿意这样作，而要继续以消极态度对待企业的生产和经营管理，继续从事“五毒”活动，特别是进行政治性的破坏活动，那就是自绝于国家和人民。
    在进行上述教育的同时，各地工商行政部门和有关的国营企业，特别是私营企业中的党组织和工会，还应该教育工人群众提高警惕，动员他们加强对资本家的监督。要使每一个工人都认识到不法资本家的违法犯罪行为，不但损害了国家的利益，也损害了工人阶级和广大人民的利益，必须坚决加以反对。今后不论在私营企业的一般生产和经营中，或在它们为国家加工订货或代购代销等工作中，工人群众都应监督资本家进行正当的生产和经营。如果发现资本家有投机取巧、违反合同等行为，就应及时劝告和检举。
    随着国家过渡时期总任务的宣传教育更加普遍深入，随着国家资本主义企业的优越性的日益显露，在私营工商业者中必然会出现更多爱国守法、愿意接受改造的先进人物；但同时也必然会有一部分不法资本家，坚决反抗国家的利用、限制和改造政策，而且这种斗争必然要日趋尖锐和复杂。因此，每一个国家工作人员都应保持高度的警惕性，随时随地防止和克服不法资本家的各种违法犯罪行为。但是，目前不论在我们党内或国家机关和国营企业中，都有一部分人对这一点认识不足，错误地以为经过“五反”运动，不法资本家再也不敢施行“五毒”罪行了，因此他们在和私商打交道的时候，就失掉了必要的警惕。这不仅在这次军用胶鞋加工的过程中表现出来，而且在目前数量很大的加工订货工作中也是存在的。有些国家机关和国营企业部门的工作人员，在向私营厂商加工订货时，既不在事前认真地调查了解私营厂商的资金、机器设备、技术条件和营业信用，也不努力钻研有关加工订货的各种问题，就盲目地与私商签订合同，过多地预付订金或货款，因而使得成本的核算不精确，产品的规格、质量和交货日期等都发生许多问题。对于成品的验收，也有许多马虎草率的现象。这就使得不法资本家敢于为所欲为，大肆投机取巧，大量偷工减料和盗窃国家资财。更严重的是，还有少数国家工作人员沾染了卑鄙的资产阶级个人主义思想，竟至和不法资本家同流合污，成了他们盗骗国家资财的代理人。“五反”运动以后，各地在加工订货中所以仍然发生了一些成本过高、产品不合规格、到期不交货、私商挪用或盗骗货款等现象，都是和上述问题分不开的。
    各级国家机关和国营企业部门，今后对于那些经不起资产阶级思想的腐蚀而蜕化变质的工作人员必须从严惩处，同时更要加紧教育所有的国家工作人员尤其是经常和资产阶级打交道的工作人员，使他们认识到：加工订货、统购包销和代购代销等都是国家资本主义的形式。通过这种种形式，国家可以更为有效地实现对资本主义工商业的利用、限制和改造政策，监督私营企业改善经营管理，克服私营企业生产上的盲目性和无政府状态，正确发挥它有利于国计民生的积极作用，防止它不利于国计民生的消极作用。因此，一切有关的国家机关和国营企业在向私商加工订货、委托他们代购代销或统购包销他们的产品的时候，必须加强领导和监督，一方面要按照国家的政策法令，帮助他们解决生产和经营上的困难；另一方面则应督促他们按照合同办事，积极地搞好生产和经营，圆满地完成国家所交付的任务。这种领导和监督私营企业的生产和经营管理的工作，是国家交给有关机关和国营企业的一项重大的政治责任。任何忽视加工订货、统购包销和代购代销的重大政治意义，以为只是一种简单的买卖行为，是非常错误的。
    不法资本家的违法犯罪行为，损害了国家和人民的利益，同时也沾污了爱国工商业者的信誉。反对他们的违法犯罪行为，不但是党政机关、国营企业和工人群众的事情，也是爱国工商业者的事情。希望每一个爱国的工商业者，积极协助人民政府在私营企业中搞好爱国守法的教育，坚决和那些害群之马作斗争。这是爱国工商业者应该担负的一项光荣的任务。
