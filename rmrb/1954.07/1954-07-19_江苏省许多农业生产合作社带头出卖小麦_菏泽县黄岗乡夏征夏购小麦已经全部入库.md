Many agricultural production cooperatives in Jiangsu Province are taking the lead in selling wheat to the state. The Youai Agricultural Production Cooperative in Shuanggang District, Binhai County, rationally divided labor and worked collectively during the wheat harvest, completing the harvesting of more than 400 mu of wheat fields in five days, four days earlier than local individual farmers. The cooperative has already sold more than 22,000 jin of wheat to the state. The Xinshe Agricultural Production Cooperative in Pandang District, Binhai County, harvested wheat four days earlier than in previous years this year due to the state's assistance with horse-drawn harvesters. The members deeply appreciated the benefits of national industrialization and actively dried, winnowed, and cleaned 21,400 jin of wheat to sell to the state. The Xiezhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Linji District, Huai'an County, achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest this year. The cooperative sold more than 21,000 jin of wheat to the state, prompting members of five nearby mutual aid teams and individual farmers to also sell 18,000 jin of wheat to the state. Members of the Xiji Agricultural Production Cooperative in Qinnan District, Yancheng County, still remember the guarantees they made to workers during the Spring Festival get-together this year and enthusiastically sold new wheat to the state to support industrial construction; the first and second production teams alone sold more than 6,500 jin of wheat to the state. This wheat had been dried three times, winnowed twice, and some even sieved once.

Farmers in Huanggang Township, Fifth District, Heze County, Shandong Province, enthusiastically paid the summer grain tax and sold wheat. By June 26, the township had completed the summer grain collection and purchase tasks ahead of schedule.

When carrying out the summer grain collection and purchase work, the township first led farmers from within and outside the Party to summarize the summer harvest and planting work, arrange the production plan for the next stage, and understand the local grain unified purchase and sale work and wheat output. Then, based on the local actual situation, they led farmers to summarize the grain unified purchase and sale work in 1953 and comprehensively publicized the summer grain collection and purchase policies. After deliberation and discussion at the township people's congress meeting, mass meetings, and forums for the elderly and women, farmers throughout the township, under the slogan of "Sell surplus wheat to the state to support national construction," launched a upsurge in selling wheat and paying grain. Before the end of June, farmers throughout the township had sent more than 200,000 jin of wheat into the state granaries.

    江苏省许多农业生产合作社带头出卖小麦
    菏泽县黄岗乡夏征夏购小麦已经全部入库
    江苏省许多农业生产合作社带头把小麦卖给国家。滨海县双港区友爱农业生产合作社在麦收中合理分工，集体劳动，五天内就把四百多亩小麦收割完毕，比当地单干农民提早四天。该社已把二万二千多斤小麦卖给了国家。该县潘荡区辛舍农业生产合作社，今年由于国家用马拉收割机帮助收割，比往年提早四天割完了小麦。社员们深刻体会到国家工业化对自己的好处，积极把二万一千四百斤小麦晒干扬净，卖给国家。淮安县林集区谢庄农业生产合作社，今年获得空前的丰收。该社把二万一千多斤小麦卖给国家，推动附近五个互助组的组员和单干农民也卖给国家一万八千斤小麦。盐城县秦南区西季农业生产合作社的社员们都还记得今年春节和工人联欢时向工人们提出的保证，踊跃把新麦卖给国家，支援工业建设；仅第一、第二生产队，就卖给国家六千五百多斤小麦。这些小麦都晒了三遍，扬了两遍，有的还用筛子筛了一遍。
    山东省菏泽县第五区黄岗乡农民踊跃缴纳夏征公粮，出售小麦。到六月二十六日，全乡夏征、夏购任务已经提前完成。
    该乡在进行夏征夏购工作时，首先由党内到党外领导农民总结了夏收夏种工作，安排了下一阶段的生产计划，结合了解了当地粮食统购统销工作和小麦产量等方面的情况。然后，根据当地实际情况，领导农民总结了一九五三年的粮食统购统销工作，全面宣传了夏征、夏购政策。经过乡人民代表大会会议、群众大会、老人和妇女座谈会等的酝酿讨论，全乡农民在“卖余麦给国家，支援国家建设”的口号下，掀起了售麦缴粮热潮。在六月底以前，全乡农民即把二十余万斤小麦全部送入了国家粮库。
