Schools must closely coordinate education with family education and social education. Whether it is students' moral education, scientific knowledge education, or health education, all cannot be separated from the assistance of families and society. Labor education, which is currently of concern to all parties, is naturally the same. To obtain the assistance of parents and effectively conduct labor education for students, it is necessary to actively publicize the idea of ​​labor glory to students' parents, help them establish correct labor views, and overcome the idea of ​​despising physical labor and physical laborers. This publicity work must not only be carried out among the parents of graduating students, but also among all students' parents, so that every parent can educate their children with the idea of ​​labor glory, so that their children, whether they go on to further education or engage in labor production, will be guided by this idea. At present, in order to create new social public opinion, correctly guide the further education and engagement in labor production of graduates from senior primary schools and junior middle schools, and do a good job in publicity and education for students' parents, it is of decisive significance.

In the past year, thanks to the education of the Party and the People's Government, and the exemplary actions of a large number of graduates from senior primary schools and junior middle schools in labor production, some parents have a correct understanding of the Party and the People's Government's cultural and educational policies, the purpose of their children's education, and the significance of engaging in physical labor. They realize that whether their children go on to further education and prepare to serve national construction, or immediately participate in production labor after graduating from senior primary schools and junior middle schools, and train and improve themselves in production and spare-time study, are equally glorious. Therefore, they can adopt a correct attitude towards the issue of their children's further education or engagement in labor production. However, there are still many parents, including some cadres, teachers, medical staff, and technical personnel, who still despise physical labor and physical laborers, and regard studying and engaging in labor production as two incompatible things. They believe that the purpose of studying is only to become cadres or experts, and not to engage in labor production; and they believe that only by studying at school can one become a cadre or an expert. They do not understand that outstanding talents can be cultivated in labor production and spare-time study. They also do not understand that the purpose of developing general education in people's democratic countries and socialist countries is to gradually improve the knowledge level of the working people, so that the working people have cultural cultivation to meet the ever-increasing needs of social production for culture. Primary school education is compulsory national education, which will gradually become universal with the development of production, and the duration will also gradually be extended. After receiving compulsory education, only a portion of graduates can go on to further education after passing examinations. The vast majority of graduates should engage in industrial, agricultural, and other production labor. After participating in production labor, they can continue to study hard in production practice to improve their knowledge level. The view that all middle and primary school graduates must go on to further education is wrong and impossible. Many parents do not understand the nature of general education and pin their hopes entirely on their children's further education. Therefore, when this hope cannot be fully satisfied, they adopt some inappropriate or incorrect methods, making their children rush to finish their homework day and night; for children who cannot go on to further education, they give cold ridicule or even beatings, damaging their children's physical and mental health. The erroneous thoughts and actions of some parents also put great pressure on school teachers. This creates more difficulties for guiding students to participate in labor production.

Why do so many parents still have wrong ideas after a long period of publicity and education? This is certainly because the influence of old social ideas is very deep, and it requires long-term efforts rather than one or two years to completely eliminate them. However, upon examining our publicity and education work, there are indeed many shortcomings. In the past, it was absolutely necessary to conduct general publicity to all parties and explain general principles, and it has achieved many results. However, it is a major shortcoming to keep the publicity work at such a level for a long time, without timely changing working methods according to the changes in the masses' thinking, deeply investigating and studying the specific thoughts of various objects, and further promoting the publicity and education work. Moreover, due to neglecting the direct and huge impact of parents' thoughts on students, and neglecting the significant role of parents' remarks in social public opinion, the situation where social publicity work and school labor education do not match currently exists in many places. Although school labor education still has many shortcomings that urgently need to be improved, generally speaking, it is being actively carried out; however, the publicity and education work for parents and the general public not only has the shortcomings of generalization, but some places have even relaxed this work, and some places have neglected this work, so that the erroneous ideas of some parents who despise physical labor and physical laborers have not been corrected. As a result, students hear the principles of the glory of labor at school, but hear the opposite principles at home, which greatly affects the effectiveness of school labor education. This situation cannot continue to exist. All localities should seize the time, especially the summer vacation time, to actively carry out social publicity work, create new ways of publicity and education work, effectively solve the ideological problems of parents, truly transform the policies of the Party and the People's Government into the thoughts of the broad masses, closely cooperate with school labor education, and create better conditions for cultivating students' labor views and for guiding this year's graduates from senior primary schools and junior middle schools who cannot go on to further education to engage in labor production.

In this regard, the experience of some places in using the method of holding parent meetings to conduct publicity and education for parents is very worthy of attention.

Parent meetings were originally a form of regular contact between schools and families to obtain parents' regular assistance to the school. It is not a temporary measure. Its content should be multifaceted. At parent meetings, the principal and teachers should report on the situation of the school and teaching work, raise questions, and ask parents to assist in solving them in order to teach students well. Asking parents to correctly conduct labor education for their children is naturally one of the contents of the parent meeting. However, in past parent meetings, this content was neglected. Therefore, in the current situation, it is absolutely necessary to hold parent meetings to centrally resolve parents' ideological problems regarding their children's further education and engagement in labor production.

The experience of several places in holding parent meetings proves that parent meetings are a good form of educating the masses about the glory of labor, patriotic education for the purpose of developing the motherland's production through studying, and education about the cultural and educational policies of the Party and the People's Government. Such meetings should be conducted under the direct guidance of the local Party committee and government's cultural and educational departments. Based on thorough investigation and research before the meeting, the school should give a systematic and popular report to the parents, explaining the principles clearly in light of the parents' specific thoughts, so that the parents can obtain clear policy ideas. At the same time, the method of self-education by the masses should be adopted, and the parent activists discovered before the meeting should persuade other parents based on their own understanding and experience. Parents should be made to understand that their desire to cultivate their children into useful people is consistent with the purpose of the state in running education. However, to achieve this goal, in addition to letting children receive a certain amount of school education, they must also be cultivated in practical work and spare-time study, and cannot only rely on further education. Therefore, parents should handle the issue of their children's further education and engagement in labor production in accordance with the cultural and educational policies of the Party and the People's Government; if they adopt an incorrect attitude according to their own wrong ideas, it will not only not conform to the interests of the state, but also not conform to the interests of the parents and their children.

The experience of several places in holding parent meetings also proves that many parents cannot correctly treat the issue of their children's further education and engagement in labor production not only because they have wrong ideas, but also because they have practical difficulties. Therefore, after the parents' ideological problems are initially resolved, there will still be some specific difficult problems raised before us. For the practical difficulties of parents, a sympathetic attitude should be adopted, putting ourselves in their shoes, and discussing solutions with them together. For example, some senior primary school graduates who cannot go on to further education are too young to engage in production; if they study at home to prepare to engage in labor, they are very likely to abandon their studies because no one is tutoring them, so parents are very worried. When encountering such problems, it should be explained to the parents that the local Party organization, education administrative department, school, and Youth League organization are very concerned about the parents' difficulties; at the same time, it should be explained what methods have been taken according to the conditions at that time and place, and what methods will be taken to solve this problem, so that parents feel that the Party and the People's Government are trying their best to help parents overcome difficulties. In this way, parents will be convinced and will be able to adopt an active and positive attitude to solve the problems of their children's further education, engagement in labor production, and self-study at home.

The experience of several places in holding parent meetings also proves that the idea of ​​many parents despising physical labor and physical laborers is deep-rooted, and it is necessary to patiently, meticulously, and repeatedly conduct publicity and education for them. Therefore, it is necessary to pay close attention to the parents' reactions after the meeting. Those who perform well should be encouraged; those who do not have a clear understanding of the ideas should continue to be educated through home visits, individual talks, etc., to improve their level of ideological understanding, so as to consolidate and expand the publicity and education effect of the parent meeting.

The experience of several places in holding parent meetings is worth referring to by all localities. More importantly, all localities should create new experiences suitable for local conditions based on the specific conditions of their locality to strengthen the publicity and education work for parents and make this work regular. Doing a good job in this work and other related tasks, and smoothly guiding graduates from senior primary schools and junior middle schools who cannot go on to further education to engage in labor production, is one of the important tasks of organizing production. This task should not be viewed as opposing production and other tasks, nor should it be relaxed or even neglected because production and other tasks are busy. The cultural and educational departments of the Party committees and people's governments of all localities should strengthen specific guidance on this work, and send people down to inspect the work at any time, discover good experiences, and summarize them in a timely manner to guide the general areas. The leading organs should also supervise and help those places that neglect social publicity work at any time, so that this work can cooperate with the progress of school labor education, and prepare for organizing this year's graduates from senior primary schools and junior middle schools who cannot go on to further education to engage in labor production.

### 向学生家长积极进行劳动光荣的教育

    向学生家长积极进行劳动光荣的教育
    学校教育必须和家庭教育、社会教育密切配合。不论学生的道德教育，科学知识教育，健康教育，都不能离开家庭和社会的协助，目前为各方面所关心的劳动教育，自然也是这样。要取得家长的协助，有效地向学生进行劳动教育，就必须积极地向学生家长宣传劳动光荣的思想，帮助他们树立正确的劳动观点，克服轻视体力劳动和体力劳动者的思想。这种宣传工作，不仅须要在毕业班学生家长中进行，而且须要在一切学生家长中进行，以便使每一个家长都能够用劳动光荣的思想教育自己的子女，使自己的子女不论升学，不论从事劳动生产，都受这种思想的指导。目前，为了造成新的社会舆论，正确地指导高小和初中毕业生升学和从事劳动生产，作好对学生家长的宣传教育工作，是具有决定性的意义的。
    在过去一年当中，由于党和人民政府的教育，由于大批高小和初中毕业生在劳动生产中的模范行动，一部分家长对于党和人民政府的文教政策，对于子女读书的目的，对于从事体力劳动的意义，都有了正确的理解，认识到不论子女升学深造，准备为国家建设服务，或者在高小和初中毕业之后立即参加生产劳动，在生产和业余学习中锻炼自己，提高自己，同样是光荣的；因而能够采取正确的态度来对待子女升学或从事劳动生产的问题。但是也还有许多家长，其中包括一部分干部、教师、医务和技术人员，依然轻视体力劳动，轻视体力劳动者，把读书和从事劳动生产看成两件不能相容的事情，以为读书的目的仅仅是为了当干部，当专家，而不能从事劳动生产；并且以为只有住学校读书，才能够当干部，当专家，不了解在劳动生产和业余学习中完全可以培养出色的人才。他们也不了解人民民主国家和社会主义国家发展普通教育的目的，是要逐步提高劳动人民的知识水平，使劳动人民都有文化教养，以适应社会生产对于文化的日益增长的需要。小学教育是国民义务教育的性质，它将随着生产的发展而逐渐普及，年限也将逐步延长。在受过义务教育之后，只能有一部分毕业生经过考试，升学深造，绝大多数毕业生则应该从事工农业以及其他生产劳动，而他们在参加生产劳动之后，还是可以在生产实践中继续努力学习，以提高自己的知识水平的。认为一切中、小学毕业生都必须升学的看法是错误的，也是不可能的。许多家长不了解普通教育的这种性质，对子女的希望完全寄托于升学，因而当这种希望不能完全满足的时候，就采取了一些不适当或不正确的方法，要子女夜以继日地赶功课；对不能升学的子女，则冷讽热嘲，甚至打骂，损害了子女的身心健康。一部分家长的错误思想和行动，也给学校教师以很大压力。这样就给引导学生参加劳动生产的工作造成更多的困难。
    为什么经过了很长时间的宣传教育，还有许多家长存在着错误思想呢？这固然由于旧社会思想的影响很深，需要长期的努力而不是一两年能够清除净尽的；但是检查一下我们的宣传教育工作，也确实存在着不少缺点。在过去一段时间里面，我们向各方面进行一般的宣传，讲述一般的道理，是完全必要的，并且已经收到了不少效果。然而把宣传工作长时间停留在这样的水平上，没有根据群众思想的变化，及时改变工作方法，深入地调查研究各种对象的具体思想，把宣传教育工作推进一步，则是我们的很大缺点。而且由于忽视家长的思想对学生所发生的直接的巨大的影响，忽视家长的言论在社会舆论中所发生的重大作用，目前在许多地方，社会宣传工作和学校劳动教育不相适应的情况是存在的。尽管学校的劳动教育还存在着许多缺点，亟待改进，但一般说，是在积极进行的；而对家长和一般群众的宣传教育工作，则不仅存在着一般化的缺点，甚至有些地方放松了这一工作，有些地方则忽视了这一工作，以致某些家长轻视体力劳动和体力劳动者的错误思想没有得到纠正。结果，学生在校内听的是劳动光荣的道理，回到家里，听的却是相反的道理，这就大大影响了学校劳动教育的效果。这种状况是不能够继续存在下去的。各地应当抓紧时间，特别是暑假的时间，积极开展社会宣传工作，创造新的宣传教育工作方式，有效地解决家长的思想问题，把党和人民政府的政策，真正变成为广大群众的思想，紧密地配合学校的劳动教育，为培养学生的劳动观点，为引导今年不能升学的高小和初中毕业生从事劳动生产的工作创造更好的条件。
    在这方面，有些地方运用召开家长会议的方法，向家长进行宣传教育的经验，是很值得重视的。
    家长会议本来是学校和家庭经常联系，以取得家长对学校经常帮助的一种形式，它不是一种临时的措施。它的内容应该是多方面的，在家长会议上，校长、教师要报告学校及教导工作的情况，提出问题，请家长协助解决，以求把学生教好，而要求家长正确地向子女进行劳动教育，自然也是家长会议的内容之一。但是在过去的家长会议中，这一内容被忽视了。因此，在目前情况下，召开家长会议，集中地解决家长对子女升学和从事劳动生产的思想问题，是完全必要的。
    若干地方召开家长会议的经验证明，家长会议是向群众进行劳动光荣的教育，进行读书是为了发展祖国生产的爱国主义教育，进行党和人民政府的文教政策教育的良好形式。这样的会议，应当在当地党委和政府文教部门的直接指导下进行。要根据会前周密的调查研究，由学校方面向家长作系统的通俗的报告，针对家长的具体思想讲清道理，使家长获得明确的政策思想。同时要采用群众自己教育自己的方式，由在会前发现的家长积极分子，根据自己的认识和体会，说服其他家长。要使家长们了解，他们要求把子女培养成为有用的人，这和国家办教育的目的是一致的。但是，要达到这个目的，除了让子女受到一定的学校教育以外，还要在实际工作和业余学习中培养他们，而不能仅仅依靠升学。因此，家长对于子女的升学和从事劳动生产的问题，应当根据党和人民政府的文教政策来处理；如果按照自己的错误思想，采取不正确的态度，那不仅不符合国家利益，也不符合家长及其子女的利益。
    若干地方召开家长会议的经验也证明，许多家长之所以不能正确地对待子女升学和从事劳动生产的问题，不仅因为有着错误思想，而且因为有着实际困难。所以在家长的思想问题初步解决之后，还会有若干具体困难问题提到我们面前。对于家长的实际困难，应当采取同情的态度，设身处地地为他们着想，和他们共同商量解决办法。例如，有些不能升学的高小毕业生，因为年龄太小，不能从事生产；如果在家自修，准备从事劳动，又因为无人辅导，很可能使学业荒废，所以家长很感忧虑。遇到这样的问题，就应当向家长说明，当地的党组织、教育行政部门、学校以及青年团组织，对于家长的这种困难，是很关心的；同时要说明已经根据当时当地的条件，采取了什么办法，并且将要采取什么办法，来解决这种问题，使家长感到党和人民政府是想尽一切办法帮助家长克服困难的。这样，家长们才会口服心服，因而能够采取主动的积极的态度，来解决子女的升学、从事劳动生产和在家自修的问题。
    若干地方召开家长会议的经验也证明，许多家长轻视体力劳动、轻视体力劳动者的思想，是根深柢固的，必须耐心地、细致地、反复地向他们进行宣传教育。因此须要十分注意家长在会后的反应，对表现好的，应当鼓励；对思想不通的，应当采取家庭访问、个别谈话等等的方式，继续进行教育，提高他们的思想认识水平，以巩固和扩大家长会议的宣传教育效果。
    若干地方召开家长会议的经验值得各地参考。更重要的是，各地要根据当地的具体条件，创造适合当地情况的新经验，以加强对家长的宣传教育工作，并使这一工作经常化。做好这一工作以及其他与此有关的各项工作，顺利地引导不能升学的高小和初中毕业生从事劳动生产，乃是组织生产的重要工作之一，不能把这项工作和生产以及其他工作对立起来看待，也不能因为生产和其他工作繁忙，而放松甚至忽视了这一工作。各地党委和人民政府的文教部门应当加强对这一工作的具体指导，要随时派人下去检查工作，发现好的经验，及时加以总结，以指导一般地区。领导机关还应当随时督促和帮助那些忽视社会宣传工作的地方，使这项工作能够配合学校劳动教育的进展，为组织今年不能升学的高小和初中毕业生从事劳动生产的工作作好准备。
