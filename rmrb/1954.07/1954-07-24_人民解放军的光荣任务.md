The national delegation for consoling the People's Liberation Army conducted extensive consoling work throughout the country, greatly encouraging and educating all personnel of the People's Liberation Army. The people of the whole country further understood the tremendous achievements of the national defense construction事业 over the past few years and the great contributions of the People's Liberation Army in defending the motherland. This extensive consoling work further strengthened the unity between the army and the people, providing a widespread education to all personnel of the People's Liberation Army and the people of the whole country.

The People's Liberation Army is the army of the people, and an important tool for the Chinese Communist Party to lead the people of the whole country to defeat the enemy and consolidate victory. For more than 20 years, the Chinese people have relied on such a strong revolutionary army led by the Party, and on the close unity between the army and the people, to overcome all kinds of unimaginable difficulties, persist in long-term struggle, and finally achieve the victory of the New Democratic Revolution. The long revolutionary war fully proves that the leadership of the Party is the life of the people's army, and the love and support of the broad masses of the people is the guarantee of the people's army's victory.

Today, American imperialism is still occupying our territory of Taiwan, and is intensifying its efforts to drive the Chiang Kai-shek remnant bandits to sabotage our country's construction and the peaceful life of the people of the whole country. Under such circumstances, the task of the People's Liberation Army in the future should be to strive to build itself into an excellent modern revolutionary army, to defend our country's socialist construction, defend against imperialist aggression, liberate Taiwan, and eliminate the counter-revolutionary forces of the Chiang Kai-shek remnant bandits.

The modernization of the People's Liberation Army can never be separated from the country's industrialization, especially the construction of heavy industry. A modern army must have a sufficient quantity of the latest, most modern equipment and modern transportation and means of transportation. If we do not have a strong industry, especially a strong heavy industry, we cannot even talk about modern national defense construction, so national industrialization is the foundation of national defense modernization. The broad commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army understand this truth. In order to directly support the country's socialist industrialization construction, they practice increasing production and practicing economy, cherish weapons, greatly overfulfill the purchase of national construction bonds, mobilize their families to participate in the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement, sell surplus grain to the state, help transport grain for disaster relief, and help rescue various natural disasters. They have shown a model of patriotism. Some units of the People's Liberation Army are still directly undertaking the task of participating in national industrial construction and agricultural production. The People's Liberation Army must continue to carry forward the fine traditions of hard work and plain living, and the spirit of patriotism and revolutionary heroism, and actively support the country's industrial construction, to accelerate socialist industrialization and national defense modernization.

At present, the regular central work of the modernization construction of the People's Liberation Army should be to train troops, especially to train cadres. The People's Liberation Army has very rich combat experience and military construction experience, and has trained countless outstanding commanders and leading cadres in the long revolutionary war. These experiences and achievements are very valuable, and they were obtained in the long revolutionary war and with the blood and lives of countless martyrs. But these experiences are not enough today, because the People's Liberation Army is now a modern army including many services and arms. This requires learning to skillfully master new modern weapons and complex technologies. Therefore, all services and units of the People's Liberation Army must constantly carry out military training in the future, so that the command art and organizational ability of commanders and leading cadres at all levels can be raised to a new level.

A regular military system is an indispensable condition for building a modern army. In recent years, the People's Liberation Army has made significant achievements in unified command, unified organization, unified training, unified system, and unified discipline, and is moving towards the road of regularization, but it must continue to work hard to strengthen highly centralized and unified organization and discipline to adapt to the needs of modernization construction.

To carry out modern and regular military training and various constructions, the important key lies in learning the advanced Soviet military science. To learn well, we must never be satisfied with the achievements we have made in the past and stick to the old ways, nor can we be eager for quick success without regard to objective conditions. We must earnestly delve into the practice of various military tasks, and on the basis of the fine traditions of the People's Liberation Army, according to the current specific conditions, humbly and comprehensively learn from the Soviet Union's experience in military construction. The Soviet army is a great example for the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and the Soviet army's today is the Chinese People's Liberation Army's tomorrow.

To realize the arduous and complex task of modernization and regularization construction, the People's Liberation Army must raise its political consciousness to a new level, that is, the level of socialism. Under the long-term education of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, the People's Liberation Army has been tempered into an army with a high degree of political consciousness. In the past 20 years, countless moving heroic deeds and heroic figures have emerged, becoming models for the people of the whole country to learn from. But it cannot be denied that the broad commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army mostly come from peasants and the urban petty bourgeoisie, and today they still maintain close social ties with peasants and the petty bourgeoisie. Therefore, in the historical period of transition from New Democracy to Socialism, all personnel of the People's Liberation Army must further deeply study the Party's general line in the transition period, implement the resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party, carry out education on enhancing the Party's unity, criticize and overcome the influence of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideas, and continuously improve their level of awareness.

Commander-in-Chief Zhu De pointed out at the meeting of the National People's Delegation for Consoling the People's Liberation Army to Consoling the People's Revolutionary Military Commission: "In our army, there are also individual personnel who do not understand the importance of the responsibilities given to us by the people of the whole country, and after the victory of the whole country, they have fostered complacency, pride, and self-satisfaction; in addition, there are also individual personnel who have behaviors that violate government decrees and the interests of the masses. These are absolutely not allowed in our people's army and must be corrected quickly." The People's Liberation Army has experienced a long revolutionary war and established immortal feats for the Chinese people, thus gaining lofty honor. This should become a force to encourage every revolutionary soldier of the People's Liberation Army to work hard to move forward, and should never become a reason for arrogance and complacency. We must never foster a sense of relaxation because of the victory of the New Democratic Revolution, the victory of the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, and the fact that the people of the motherland are currently dedicated to economic construction, feeling that we can take a breather now. If we do this, we will make a huge mistake. Our enemies - American imperialism, the Chiang Kai-shek remnant bandits, and domestic counter-revolutionaries have not relaxed. They are trying to sabotage our revolutionary cause and attempting to restore capitalism in China at all times. The People's Liberation Army must be ready at all times to strike at the provocations of the US-Chiang bandit gang and finally liberate Taiwan. All commanders and fighters must constantly carry out education on loving the motherland and loving the people, exemplarily abide by the Party's policies and implement government decrees; and through various means, constantly listen to the opinions and criticisms of the local Party organizations and governments at all levels, constantly listen to the opinions and criticisms of the broad masses of the people, oppose arrogance, complacency, and麻痹鬆懈 emotions, and continue to carry forward the fine tradition of unity between the army and the people, and the spirit of serving the people wholeheartedly, diligently and conscientiously, and being loyal to the motherland.

The people of the whole country not only have unlimited concern for their army, but also place ardent expectations on their army. The People's Liberation Army must live up to the ardent expectations of the people of the whole country, and accelerate the construction of an excellent modern revolutionary army, and strive to the end for the liberation of Taiwan, the defense of the security of the motherland, and the peace of Asia and the world.

### 人民解放军的光荣任务

    人民解放军的光荣任务
    全国人民慰问人民解放军代表团，在全国各地进行了广泛的慰问工作，使人民解放军的全体人员受到了极大的鼓舞和教育；全国人民也进一步了解几年来祖国国防建设事业的巨大成就和人民解放军保卫祖国的伟大贡献。这次广泛的慰问工作，进一步加强了军民之间的团结，使人民解放军的全体人员和全国人民都受到一次广泛的教育。
    人民解放军是人民的军队，是中国共产党领导全国人民战胜敌人和巩固胜利的重要工具。二十多年来，中国人民就是因为有了党领导的这样一支坚强的革命军队，并有了军队和人民的亲密团结，才战胜了各种难以想像的困难，坚持了长期的战斗，最后取得了新民主主义革命的胜利。长期的革命战争充分证明：党的领导是人民军队的生命，广大人民群众的爱戴和支援是人民军队战斗胜利的保证。
    今天，美国帝国主义仍然侵占着我国的领土台湾，正在加紧驱使蒋介石残余匪帮，来破坏我国的建设和全国人民的和平生活。在这样的情况之下，人民解放军今后工作的任务应该是努力建设成为一支优良的现代化的革命军队，以保卫我国社会主义建设，防御帝国主义的侵略，解放台湾，消灭蒋介石残余匪帮的反革命势力。
    人民解放军现代化建设，绝不能离开国家的工业化建设，特别是重工业建设。现代化的军队必须要有足够数量的、最新式的、现代化的装备和现代化的交通及交通工具。如果我们没有强大的工业，特别是强大的重工业，我们就根本谈不上现代化的国防建设，所以国家工业化是国防现代化的基础。人民解放军的广大指挥员、战斗员是理解这个道理的。为了直接支援国家的社会主义工业化建设，他们厉行增产节约，爱护武器，大大超额地认购国家建设公债，动员家属参加农业互助合作运动、把余粮卖给国家，帮助运粮救灾，帮助抢救各种自然灾害，他们表现了模范的爱国主义精神。人民解放军的若干部队现在也还直接担负着参加国家工业建设和农业生产的任务。人民解放军必须继续发扬艰苦朴素的优良传统和爱国主义及革命英雄主义的精神，积极支援国家的工业建设，以加速社会主义工业化和国防现代化。
    目前人民解放军现代化建设的经常的中心工作应该是训练部队，特别是训练干部。人民解放军有着非常丰富的战斗经验和军事建设的经验，在长期的革命战争中锻炼出无数优秀的指挥人员和领导干部。这些经验和成就是非常可贵的，它是在长期的革命战争中和无数烈士付出了鲜血和生命才得来的。但是这些经验今天来说还是不够的，因为人民解放军现在是包括许多军种、兵种的现代化军队。这就必须学会熟练地掌握新式的现代化武器和复杂的技术。因此，人民解放军各兵种各部队今后必须不断地进行军事训练，使各级指挥人员和领导干部的指挥艺术和组织能力提高到新的水平。
    正规化的军事制度是建设现代化军队必不可少的条件。近几年来人民解放军在统一指挥、统一编制、统一训练、统一制度、统一纪律等各方面，都有了显著的成绩，正向着正规化道路迈进，但还必须继续努力加强高度集中统一的组织性和纪律性，以适应现代化建设的需要。
    进行现代化、正规化的军事训练和各项建设，重要的关键就在于学习苏联先进军事科学。要学习的好，就绝不能满足于过去已有的成绩而墨守成规，也不能不顾客观条件而急于求成；就要认真地钻到各项军事工作的实践中去，在人民解放军优良传统的基础上，根据当前的具体条件，虚心地、全面地学习苏联军事建设的经验。苏联军队是中国人民解放军的伟大榜样，苏联军队的今天，就是中国人民解放军的明天。
    人民解放军要实现现代化、正规化建设的繁重而复杂的任务，必须把政治觉悟提高到新的水平，即社会主义的水平。人民解放军在中国共产党和毛泽东同志的长期教养下，已经锻炼成为一支具有高度政治觉悟的军队，二十多年来出现了无数可歌可泣的英雄事迹和英雄人物，成为全国人民学习的榜样。但是不能否认，人民解放军的广大指挥员和战斗员多是来自农民以及城市的小资产阶级，今天仍然和农民、小资产阶级保持着千丝万缕的社会联系。因此，在由新民主主义过渡到社会主义的历史时期，人民解放军全体人员必须进一步深入地学习党在过渡时期的总路线，贯彻党的七届四中全会的决议，进行关于增强党的团结的教育，批判和克服资产阶级、小资产阶级思想的影响，不断地提高觉悟程度。
    朱德总司令在全国人民慰问人民解放军代表团慰问人民革命军事委员会大会上指出：“在我们军队中，也还有个别人员，不了解全国人民所给予我们的责任的重大，在全国胜利之后，滋长了居功骄傲和自满情绪；另外，也还有个别的人员，存在着违反政府法令，违犯群众利益的行为，这些都是我们人民军队所绝对不能容许的，必须迅速地加以改正。”人民解放军经历了长期的革命战争，为中国人民建立了不朽的功勋，因而获得了崇高的荣誉，这应该成为鼓舞人民解放军每一个革命军人努力前进的力量，而决不应该因此就骄傲自满起来。我们决不能因为新民主主义革命的胜利，抗美援朝战争的胜利，当前祖国人民正在致力于经济建设而就滋长了松懈情绪，觉得现在可以松一口气了。如果这样就会犯极大的错误。我们的敌人——美帝国主义、蒋介石残余匪帮和国内反革命分子并没有松懈，他们正在时时刻刻企图来破坏我们的革命事业，企图在中国复辟。人民解放军必须随时准备打击美蒋匪帮的挑衅，最后解放台湾；全体指战员必须经常进行关于热爱祖国、热爱人民的教育，模范地遵守党的政策，执行政府的法令；并通过各种方式，经常听取各级地方党的组织和政府的意见及批评，经常听取广大人民群众的意见及批评，反对骄傲自满和麻痹松懈的情绪，继续发扬军民一致的优良传统和满腔热忱地勤勤恳恳地为人民服务和忠于祖国的精神。
    全国人民不但对自己的军队无限关切，而且对自己的军队寄予殷切的期望。人民解放军必须不负全国人民的热烈期望，加紧建设成为优良的现代化的革命军队，为解放台湾、捍卫祖国的安全和亚洲与世界的和平而奋斗到底。
