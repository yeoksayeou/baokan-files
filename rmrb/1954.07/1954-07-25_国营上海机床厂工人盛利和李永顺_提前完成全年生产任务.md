Workers Sheng Li and Li Yongshun of the State-owned Shanghai Machine Tool Plant
Complete Annual Production Tasks Ahead of Schedule

    Sheng Li, a lathe operator at the State-owned Shanghai Machine Tool Plant and a Shanghai Municipal Industrial Labor Model, had completed a year and sixteen days' worth of production tasks by July 15th, with a product quality reaching 99.25%.
    In the past six months, Sheng Li improved tools and operating methods 25 times, with the lowest improvement in labor efficiency being onefold and the highest reaching sixfold. For example, a screw for the spindle of an external cylindrical grinding machine originally took ten minutes to make, but after he improved the tool, it only took one and a half minutes, increasing efficiency nearly sixfold. As another example, for machining three oil grooves on the "dial" of an external cylindrical grinding machine, the old method was to use one tool to machine each groove one by one. Later, he changed to using three tools to cut the grooves simultaneously, increasing efficiency by twofold.
    While excellently completing his production tasks, Sheng Li neither caused a single machine tool accident nor had any work-related injuries; at the same time, he did not take a single day off.

    Li Yongshun, an advanced worker and milling machine operator at the State-owned Shanghai Machine Tool Plant, had completed a year's worth of production tasks from January to July 15th of this year.
    In these six and a half months, he improved tools and operating methods a total of fourteen times, increasing production efficiency from onefold to tenfold. In addition to improving tools and operations, he also focused on tapping the potential of machine tools to increase production efficiency. The quality of his products can also meet quality standards.

    国营上海机床厂工人盛利和李永顺
    提前完成全年生产任务
    上海市工业劳动模范、国营上海机床厂车工盛利，到七月十五日已完成了一年零十六天的生产任务，产品质量达到百分之九十九点二五。
    在今年六个多月中，盛利改进的工具和操作方法有二十五件，最少的提高劳动效率一倍，最高的达六倍。如车外圆磨床主轴的一种螺丝，原来每只要做十分钟，他改进刀具后只需一分半钟，效率提高近六倍。又如车制外圆磨床“拨盘”上三个油槽，按照老规矩，是用一把刀逐条车制，后来他改用三把刀同时割槽，效率提高了两倍。
    盛利在出色地完成生产任务中，既没有出过一次机床责任事故，又没有发生过一件工伤事故；同时，也没有请过一天假。

    国营上海机床厂先进工作者、铣工李永顺自今年一月到七月十五日，已完成了一年的生产任务。
    在这六个半月中，他改进了工具和操作方法共十四件，使生产效率提高一倍到十倍。除改进工具操作外，还从挖掘机床潜力着手，使生产效率提高。他的产品质量也都能达到质量指标。
