Xinhua News Agency, July 2nd: According to Vietnam News Agency on July 2nd: French forces in North Vietnam are being forced to reduce their defensive positions to the northern part of the Red River Delta. At the end of June, French forces were forced to abandon Nam Dinh (the capital of Nam Dinh province), Phat Diem, Bui Chu, Ninh Binh (the capital of Ninh Binh province), and Thai Binh (the capital of Thai Binh province), withdrawing to Hanoi and other places. The Vietnamese People's Army has now entered these important cities and regions in the Red River Delta and has been warmly welcomed by the newly liberated local people.

From the end of May to the end of June, French forces have been forced to withdraw from approximately sixty strongholds in North Vietnam. The retreat of the French forces is due to the continuous victories of the Vietnamese People's Army in the Winter-Spring Campaign, the growing strength of the Vietnamese People's Army (especially after the historic victory at Dien Bien Phu), and the increasing intensity of the people's struggle behind enemy lines. To avoid annihilation, the French forces were forced to change their defensive deployment in the Red River Delta region of North Vietnam. Before or simultaneously with the withdrawal from Nam Dinh City and other places, in the mid-Red River region, the enemy army had retreated from Viet Tri City, a French strategic base located at the crossroads of many important land and water transportation lines, and a major position in the Red River mid-region defense system protecting Hanoi. In Ha Dong province, the enemy army had completely withdrawn its troops from the Do Dau area, an important part of the enemy's defense system on Highway 21. In Ninh Binh province, French forces had withdrawn from more than ten strongholds. The enemy army also withdrew from nearly ten strongholds in Thai Binh province, as well as from many other strongholds in Ha Nam, Son Tay, Hai Duong, and Hung Yen provinces.

Although the enemy had mobilized many mobile units to cover its retreat, the Vietnamese People's Army still annihilated a large number of enemy troops. For example, in Hung Yen province, the Vietnamese People's Army annihilated 350 enemy troops in an ambush against French forces retreating from Trieu Duong.

After the enemy suffered new defeats, the morale of the puppet troops plummeted. In five days, in Ha Nam, Nam Dinh, and Ninh Binh provinces, approximately 700 puppet troops deserted from the French ranks. In Phat Diem, 140 puppet soldiers deserted in just one day.

Xinhua News Agency, July 2nd: According to Vietnam News Agency: Official news on the 2nd announced that under the powerful pressure of the Vietnamese People's Army, the enemy army in Thai Binh, the capital of Thai Binh province, was forced to retreat on June 30th.

In the past few weeks, the section of Highway 10 north of Thai Binh city has been under severe threat from the People's Army. On June 28th, the Vietnamese People's Army annihilated a company of enemy troops here. The next day, the garrisons of two enemy strongholds eight kilometers northwest of Thai Binh city retreated into the city. On the morning of June 30th, the enemy sent out five companies to cover the retreat of troops from five other strongholds on Highway 10. The People's Army intercepted them, annihilating four enemy companies, destroying eleven motorcycles, and seizing a large number of spoils of war. The Vietnamese People's Army also forced the enemy army in another stronghold to surrender.

Following these battles, the enemy was forced to hastily withdraw from Thai Binh City on the afternoon of June 30th.

    在强大压力下北越法军撤离约六十个据点
    越南人民军解放南定等重要城市
   【新华社二日讯】据越南通讯社二日讯：北越的法军正被迫把它的防御阵地缩小在红河三角洲的北部。六月底，法军被迫放弃南定省省会南定、发艳、裴朱、宁平省省会宁平、太平省省会太平，往河内等地撤退。越南人民军现在已进入这些红河三角洲的重要城市和地区，受到新解放的当地人民的热烈欢迎。
    从五月底到六月底，法军已经被迫撤离北越的大约六十个据点。法军的退缩，是由于在越南人民军冬春战役取得节节胜利的情况下，在越南人民军的力量日益强大，特别是在越南人民军在奠边府取得历史性的胜利之后力量大大加强的情况下，以及在敌后人民的斗争日益加强的情况下，法军为了避免遭到消灭，被迫改变它的在北越红河三角洲地区的防御部署。在撤离南定城等地以前或同时，在红河中游地区，敌军已把军队自越池城撤退，越池是位于许多重要的陆上和水上交通线的十字路口的一个法军的战略基地，并且是保卫河内的红河中游地区防御体系中的主要阵地。在河东省，敌军已把部队自渡头地区——第二十一号公路上敌军防御体系的一个重要部分——全部撤退。在宁平省，法军已自十多个据点撤退。敌军也自太平省的将近十个据点以及河南、山西、海阳、兴安等省的其他许多据点撤退。
    虽然敌军曾动员了不少机动部队来掩护它的撤退，但是越南人民军还是歼灭了大批敌军。例如，在兴安省，越南人民军在对自兆阳撤退的法军部队的伏击中，歼灭了三百五十名敌军。
    在敌军遭受新的挫败之后，伪军的士气急剧下降。在五天中，在河南、南定和宁平等省，约有七百名伪军自法军队伍里开小差。在发艳，仅在一天中，开小差的伪军士兵就有一百四十名。
   【新华社二日讯】据越南通讯社讯：二日的官方消息宣布，在越南人民军的强大压力下，太平省省会太平敌军在六月三十日被迫撤退。
    在过去几个星期中，第十号公路太平城以北的一段处于人民军的严重威胁之下。六月二十八日，越南人民军在这里歼灭了一连敌军。次日，太平城西北八公里处的两个敌军据点的守军撤到城内。六月三十日晨，敌人派出五连兵力，掩护第十号公路上其他五个据点的军队撤退。人民军予以截击，歼灭敌军四连，毁摩托车辆十一辆，并缴获大量战利品。越南人民军并迫使另一据点的敌军投降。
    在这些战斗之后，敌军即于六月三十日下午被迫匆匆撤出太平城。
