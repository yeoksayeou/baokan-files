    The flood control project for the Beijing-Hankou Railway Yellow River Bridge has been victoriously completed. The design and construction of this project were carried out according to the suggestions of Soviet experts. The main projects included the construction of fifteen fascine mattresses, the removal of obstacle mounds from the riverbed and accumulated soil under the bridge, and the construction of diversion dikes, T-dams, and water barriers to reduce river water erosion of the riverbanks and protect the roadbed. Due to frequent water level changes, the construction task was very arduous. In order to ensure the smooth progress of the project, the relevant units of the Zhengzhou Railway Administration made full preparations and obtained strong support from the Zhengzhou Municipal Party Committee, the Xinxiang Special Commissioner's Office, the Wuzhi County People's Government, and local farmers, who promptly supplied the manpower and materials needed for the project. The Yellow River Conservancy Commission also deployed workers and bulldozers, pumps and other equipment to actively support the project. In addition, with the active efforts of the workers of the Fourth Engineering Team of the Engineering Department of the Railway Administration, the project was completed ahead of schedule. With the successful completion of this flood control project, its auxiliary projects, such as bridge inspection panels and level crossings, are expected to be completed by the end of July, one month ahead of the original plan.

    京汉铁路黄河大桥防洪工程胜利完工
    京汉铁路黄河大桥防洪工程已胜利完工。这一项工程的设计并施工都是按照苏联专家的建议进行的，其主要工程计修筑十五个柴排，清除河床障碍土丘和桥下积土，减少河水冲刷河岸、保护路基的导流堤、丁字坝、拦水坝等工程。由于水位经常变化，施工任务非常艰巨。为了保证工程的顺利进行，郑州铁路管理局的有关单位作了充分准备，并取得了中共郑州市委、新乡专署及武陟县人民政府以及当地农民的大力支持，及时供应了工程中所需要的人力物力。黄河水利委员会也调配了工人和推土机、抽水机等积极支援，再加上该路局工程处第四工程队的工人们的积极努力，使工程任务提前完成了。随着这项防洪工程的胜利完成，它的附属工程如桥梁检查板、平交道等工程，预计也可以在七月底完工，比原计划将提前一个月。
