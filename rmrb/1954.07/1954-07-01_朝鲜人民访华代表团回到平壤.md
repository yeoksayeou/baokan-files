    Kim Chun-hae said: The work of the Korean People's Delegation to China has strengthened the historical friendship between the Korean and Chinese people and the exchange of experiences in struggle and culture. The strengthening of the friendship and solidarity between the Korean and Chinese people is a great contribution to the cause of consolidating world peace. I believe that after returning home, the delegation will convey the situation of its work in China, introduce the deeds of struggle of the Chinese people, and make great achievements in inspiring the Korean people to strive to complete the Three-Year Plan for the recovery and development of the Korean People's Economy and to further strengthen Korean-Chinese friendship.

    Delegation leader Kim Ung-gi delivered a response. He said: During our visit to the great friendly nation of China, we conveyed the warm gratitude of the Korean people to the Chinese people, conveyed the heroic deeds of the Korean people, the People's Army, and the Chinese People's Volunteers during the war, as well as the achievements of the Korean people in post-war reconstruction, and conveyed the firm determination of the Korean people to strive for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland. We received a warm welcome and love from the Chinese people, and deeply felt how profound the Korean-Chinese friendship is. We saw the development of the People's China, and saw our Chinese brothers, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, rise up for new construction towards the great socialist goal and launch the movement to resist America and aid Korea more deeply. All of this deeply moved us.

    Kim Ung-gi said: The entire Chinese people expressed infinite anger at the actions of the American ruling clique in breaking the Geneva Conference's discussion on the Korean issue. They are determined to further assist the Korean people in striving for the peaceful reunification and independence of Korea. In order to repay the assistance and friendship of the brotherly Chinese people and the people of other brotherly countries, we must unite more closely around the Workers' Party of Korea, the Republic's government, and Marshal Kim Il-sung, strive for the completion of the Three-Year Plan for the recovery and development of the Korean People's Economy and the peaceful reunification of the fatherland.

    The welcoming rally concluded with the singing of the national anthems of Korea and China.
