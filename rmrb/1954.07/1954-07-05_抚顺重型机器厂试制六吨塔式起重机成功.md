    Fushun Heavy Machinery Plant Successfully Trial-Produces Six-Ton Tower Crane
    The state-owned Fushun Heavy Machinery Plant has successfully trial-produced a six-ton tower crane.
    This crane is more than thirty meters high, weighs twenty tons itself, and with a twenty-meter jib, it can lift up to 40.3 meters, safely transporting two to six tons of building materials from the ground to large construction projects as high as ten stories, operated by one person using a drum-type brake. It can travel not only on long-distance railways but also on short-distance railways of forty to fifty meters. This crane is equipped with both fifteen-meter and twenty-meter jibs, which can be interchanged as needed. The height of the tower body has the following three options: 30.14 meters, 25.04 meters, and 19.94 meters, all three of which are interchangeable. It is very flexible in transporting materials within a high-altitude area of several hundred square meters. Its maximum rotation radius is twenty meters. The steel frame structure of each part is easy to assemble and disassemble. The jib can rotate 360 degrees. The rotating, hoisting, and traveling parts can operate simultaneously. Each part is equipped with a safety device, which automatically shuts down the crane when the lifting exceeds the safety limit, thus preventing machine and personal accidents.

    抚顺重型机器厂试制六吨塔式起重机成功
    国营抚顺重型机器厂六吨塔式起重机试制成功。
    这种起重机全高有三十多公尺，本身重二十吨，用二十公尺伸臂最高可吊到四○点三公尺，一个人操纵鼓型制卸器，即可安全的把二吨到六吨重的建筑材料由下面运到十层楼高的大建筑工程上去。它不但能在长距离铁道上行走，还能在四、五十公尺短距离的铁道上行走。这种起重机根据需要，备有十五公尺和二十公尺两种伸臂，可以互换，塔身的高矮有下面三种：三○点一四公尺、二五点○四公尺、十九点九四公尺，三种都可互换。它在几百平方公尺的高空内运送材料很灵活，其最大旋转半径为二十公尺，各部分的钢架结构拆装都很方便，伸臂可旋转三六○度，旋转、卷扬、行走各部分可同时动作，各部都设有保险装置，当起重超过安全限度时，它就自动关车，因此不致由此而发生机器和人身事故。
