The relevant departments of Baoji and Hanzhong Special Districts in Shaanxi Province, and the people of various counties, are enthusiastically supporting the construction of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway. Over the past few months, transportation has been busy on the Sichuan-Shaanxi Highway, with convoys of trucks, rubber-wheeled carts, and livestock transporting large quantities of grain, construction materials, and various daily necessities to construction sites such as the Qinling Tunnel and the Weihe River Bridge.

Under the unified leadership of the Baoji Branch of the Shaanxi Provincial Baoji-Chengdu Railway Construction Working Committee, the Baoji Branch of the Shaanxi Provincial Timber Company has supplied more than 1,600 cubic meters of timber. In March of this year, two timber supply stations and five acquisition points were specifically established in Baoji and Longxian, and a group of full-time cadres were dispatched deep into the mountainous areas to organize the masses to actively cut timber. From March to May of this year, the Baoji City Grain Company supplied more than 5 million jin of grain. The Baoji Branch of the China Oil and Fat Company transferred more than 100,000 jin of high-quality peanut oil and rapeseed oil from Zhengzhou in Henan and Hanzhong in Shaanxi, specifically for the consumption of railway construction workers. Before the establishment of companies such as the Baoji City Food Company, the Baoji City Branch of the Northwest Trading Company promptly organized construction materials worth 3 billion yuan, including steel plates, electrical materials, tire tools, and non-staple foods such as vermicelli, kelp, and dried bamboo shoots, fully guaranteeing the needs of the construction sites. In order to supply the vegetable needs of railway construction workers, the area planted with vegetables in the Baoji area this year increased by more than 2,700 mu compared to last year. The Baoji Branch of the China Pharmaceutical Company supplied various engineering units with medicines worth more than 180 million yuan and medical equipment worth more than 730 million yuan. In addition, the Baoji Postal and Telecommunications Bureau of Shaanxi Province also organized a large number of mobile service teams, which took turns going to various construction sites along the line to handle services such as sending letters and remittances for railway construction workers. From November of last year to May of this year, they collected a total of 927.7 million yuan in remittances, more than 3,000 registered letters, and tens of thousands of ordinary letters. With the progress of the project, the bureau recently plans to add a business office in Yangjiawan, 15 kilometers away from Baoji. The Baoji City Branch of the People's Bank of China has also played a significant role in facilitating savings, remittances, and the purchase of government bonds for railway construction workers, and they have established sub-offices and savings offices in key engineering sections.

The broad masses of farmers in the Baoji area have fully demonstrated their patriotic enthusiasm in supporting the Baoji-Chengdu Railway construction project. More than 4,000 farmers from 14 counties including Longxian, Qishan, and Fengxiang drove carts and livestock to participate in railway construction and material transportation.

Farmers in Ningqiang County, under the jurisdiction of Hanzhong Special District, had overfulfilled their timber cutting plan for the first and second quarters of this year by 117% from December of last year to April of this year. In May, the Baoji Maocao Supply Station planned to purchase 2.7 million jin of thatch, and local farmers overfulfilled the task in six days under the slogan of "Supporting Baoji-Chengdu Railway Construction." Workers at the Liqun Flour Mill in Hanzhong City improved the gears on the flour milling machine to ensure the needs of local railway construction workers, increasing the daily flour output from 200 bags to 300 bags.

    宝成铁路北段筑路工程得到沿线人民支援
    陕西省宝鸡专区、汉中专区的有关部门和各县人民，热烈支援宝成铁路的修建工程。几个月来，川陕公路上运输繁忙，成群结队的汽车、胶轮大车和牲畜，正在把大批粮食、建筑器材和各种日用品源源运往秦岭隧道和渭河大桥等施工地段。
    在陕西省宝成铁路筑路工作委员会宝鸡区分会统一领导下，陕西省木材公司宝鸡支公司先后已供应了一千六百多立方公尺的木材；今年三月间，并在宝鸡、陇县专门设立了两个木材供应站和五个收购据点调派了一批专职干部深入山区，组织群众积极开伐木材。宝鸡市粮食公司从今年三月到五月，共供应了五百多万斤粮食。中国油脂公司宝鸡支公司从河南郑州和陕西汉中等地调拨了十多万斤上等的花生油、大炒油，专门供给筑路职工食用。西北贸易公司宝鸡市支公司在食品公司等单位成立前，及早组织了价值三十亿元的钢板、电料、轮胎工具等建筑器材和粉条、海带、冬笋等副食品，充分保证了工地的需要。为了供应筑路职工的蔬菜需要，今年宝鸡地区种植蔬菜的面积较去年增加二千七百多亩。中国医药公司宝鸡支公司共供应各工程单位价值一亿八千多万元的各种药品和价值七亿三千多万元的医疗器材。此外，陕西省宝鸡邮电局并组织大批流动服务组，轮流深入沿线各工地，为筑路工人办理寄信、汇款等项工作。从去年十一月到今年五月，他们共收汇款九亿二千七百多万元，挂号信三千多件，平信数万件。随着工程的进展，这个局最近并计划在距宝鸡十五公里处的杨家湾增设一个营业处。中国人民银行宝鸡市支行在便利筑路职工储蓄、汇兑和购买公债方面也起了很大作用，他们在重点工程段都设立了分理处和储蓄所。
    宝鸡一带的广大农民在支援宝成铁路修筑工程中，充分表现了爱国热情。陇县、岐山、凤翔等十四个县的四千多名农民赶着大车、牲畜，参加了修筑铁路和运输物资的工作。
    汉中专区所属宁强县的农民，从去年十二月到今年四月已超额完成今年第一和第二季度伐木计划的百分之一百十七。五月间褒城茅草供应站计划收购茅草二百七十万斤，当地农民在“支援宝成路建筑”的口号下，六天就超额完成了。汉中市利群面厂的工人们为了保证当地筑路工人的需要，改进了磨面机上的齿轮，使面粉的日产量由二百袋提高到三百袋。                           （新华社）
