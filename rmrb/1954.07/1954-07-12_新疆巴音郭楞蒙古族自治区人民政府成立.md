The report pointed out that, based on the spirit of the state's general task on ethnic issues during the transition period and in conjunction with the Autonomous Prefecture's situation, the future focus in agriculture should be on continuing to increase yield per unit area, appropriately expanding cultivated land area, and developing agricultural mutual aid and cooperation in a planned and step-by-step manner; in animal husbandry, continue to implement the policy of protecting and developing livestock production, including that of herdsmen, carrying out the patriotic movement to increase and protect livestock, promoting mutual aid and cooperation in animal husbandry, and substantially increasing the number of livestock; and correspondingly develop water conservancy, culture, education, health, trade, and veterinary work, to achieve "prosperity for both people and livestock."

During the meeting, Gao Jinchun, Vice Chairman of the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government, led a congratulatory delegation from all ethnic groups and sectors of Xinjiang Province to the meeting. Gao Jinchun, on behalf of the Xinjiang Branch of the CPC Central Committee, the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government, and the Xinjiang Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, presented a banner to the Autonomous Prefecture People's Government.

The meeting also unanimously passed a letter of respect to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Chairman Mao, and the Central People's Government.

The Bayingolin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture is the first autonomous prefecture at the level of a special district established in Xinjiang Province. It is located on both sides of the beautiful Kaidu River in central Xinjiang, including the Yanqi Hui Autonomous County (county level) and Hejing and Heshuo counties. The Autonomous Prefecture People's Government is located in Yanqi City on the banks of the Kaidu River. There are more than 57,000 people of twelve ethnic groups, including Mongol, Uyghur, Hui, Han, Kazakh, Russian, and Manchu, within the Autonomous Prefecture. Among them, Mongols number more than 20,000, accounting for more than 34% of the total population of the region. The Autonomous Prefecture has Xinjiang's largest lake, Lake Bosten, which is rich in fish and salt. The Autonomous Prefecture also has the "Yanqi horse," famous for its running ability.

Agriculture and animal husbandry production in the Bayingolin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture have developed significantly over the past four years. Currently, organized agricultural households account for 50% of the total agricultural households in the region; the cultivated land area has increased from 100,000 mu in the early days of liberation to more than 290,000 mu. In 1953, the yield per unit area of grain crops increased by more than double compared to the early days of liberation. Originally, the grain produced in the Autonomous Prefecture each year was insufficient for half a year's consumption for the entire region. Since 1952, the grain produced in the region has not only been self-sufficient but has also had a surplus for export. The number of various livestock has also increased from more than 270,000 in the early days of liberation to more than 670,000. (Xinhua News Agency)
