    Zou Taofen and "The Masses"
    Mao Dun
    Taofen used to say that his greatest wish was to run a publication – and of course, preferably a newspaper. Under reactionary rule, running a progressive publication was bound to be persecuted, and Taofen was one who persisted in running a publication despite heavy persecution.

    The last periodical he edited was "The Masses," published in Hong Kong. "The Masses" had a considerable impact on the overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia at the time.

    After the Southern Anhui Incident, under the planning and leadership of the Communist Party, a considerable number of revolutionary and progressive cultural workers were "evacuated" from Chongqing, where oppression was becoming increasingly severe, to establish scattered cultural bases. The group that went to Hong Kong was centered around Taofen, with the aim of running newspapers and periodicals in Hong Kong. If Taofen came forward to run a newspaper in his own name, it would probably not pass the Hong Kong government's scrutiny, so they had to run a weekly magazine instead.

    At that time, Hong Kong was rife with all sorts of secret agents – Chiang's, Wang's, and so on. They were bound to sabotage Taofen's activities. The Hong Kong government naturally wouldn't welcome someone like Taofen running a publication, but since they still flaunted "freedom of speech," they couldn't openly prohibit it. Instead, they could only make trouble with the publication registration regulations. According to those regulations, the person responsible for the publication was the publisher, and the publisher had to be a "Hong Kong notable." Therefore, Taofen naturally couldn't act as the publisher to apply for registration, and he had to find another Hong Kong notable to "cooperate." But even if they found one, it was said that there was little certainty of getting approval.

    As the saying goes, "Where there's a will, there's a way." Taofen finally found a publisher. It turned out that a Mr. Cao (whose father was a so-called Hong Kong notable) had already registered to run a weekly magazine, but because he couldn't find a suitable editor-in-chief, the publication hadn't been launched yet. This Mr. Cao was still young, had read Taofen's works and the publications he edited, and could be said to have a considerable understanding of Taofen's morality and writing, and held him in admiration. Through the introduction of a third party, the matter was successful. This was the "The Masses" weekly magazine that persisted until the fall of Hong Kong and then ceased publication. From this incident, one can see how high a prestige Taofen's long-term struggle for the motherland and the people had established among the general public (and Mr. Cao was one of them)!

    With the publication in sight, Taofen immediately began work with his usual sense of responsibility and tireless spirit. He demanded that the inaugural issue be published in two weeks, which meant that the manuscripts for the inaugural issue had to be typeset in one week. He organized an editorial committee, but the friends who participated in the editorial committee all had other jobs. Their help to Taofen could only be: meeting once a week to decide on the main content of the next issue, and within this scope, writing an article themselves, or being responsible for soliciting an article from friends outside the editorial committee that the issue needed. The following major tasks had to be done by Taofen himself: the editorial comment published at the beginning of each issue, which had a fixed length, and being too long or too short would affect the planned nature of the publication's entire layout; reviewing submissions (including commissioned articles and unsolicited submissions); writing "brief replies" to readers' letters. This was a very important column of the publication. The publication's connection with readers depended on this column, and what was especially important was to use this column to express views or criticisms that were not yet suitable to be expressed in other ways (such as short comments, etc.). People who have never run a publication in that environment will not understand how important and how complicated the work of "briefly replying" to readers' letters was at that time and in that place. Taofen often said that he spent more time and energy on "brief replies" than on editorial comments.

    Running such a weekly magazine under the conditions of human and material resources at that time was difficult in ways that young friends today without that kind of experience cannot imagine. The reason why "The Masses" was able to be published, and published in a short period of time, must be attributed to Taofen's perseverance and diligence. Among the friends in Hong Kong at that time, quite a few had run publications, and when they heard that the publication was going to go from nothing to something in a week, they felt that the time limit was too short. However, Taofen's spirit of doing what he said, forging ahead bravely, invigorated everyone. Taofen was right. At that time, even a day was precious and could not be wasted. At that time, if there was hesitation and delay, then troubles would multiply, and the publication might ultimately not be born due to the sabotage of secret agents. If these special circumstances are not fully estimated, and it is rash and dogmatic to think that Taofen was just "impatient" (some people saw him that way, and he himself admitted it), that he was "looking ahead without looking behind," or, therefore, to give him a hat of "rash advance," that is completely pointless.

    On the contrary, I feel that Taofen's spirit of hating evil like an enemy, doing what he said, being full of confidence, and being extremely responsible is precisely what we should learn.

    As for the process of Taofen's ideological development – how he developed from an old democrat to a communist – I don't want to say much here. From Taofen, it has once again been proven that all old democrats who have a sense of justice, love their motherland, love humanity, and love truth will embark on the path of believing in communism in the test of struggle, both in China and abroad; this is already a law of historical development.

    邹韬奋和“大众生活”
    茅盾
    韬奋生前常说，他的最大的愿望是办好一个刊物，——当然最好是能够办报。在反动统治下，办进步刊物是一定要受到迫害的，韬奋就是在重重的迫害下办刊物而坚持到底的一人。
    他主编的最后的一个期刊就是“大众生活”，在香港出版。“大众生活”对于当时的南洋华侨起了相当大的影响。
    皖南事变后，在共产党的策划和领导之下，相当数量的革命的进步的文化工作者从压迫愈来愈严厉的重庆“疏散”出去，建立分散的文化据点。到香港的一批以韬奋为中心，目的就是要在香港办报办刊物。如果由韬奋出名来办报，恐怕是通不过香港政府这一关的，因而只好办周刊。
    当时的香港充斥着各式各样的特务，——蒋记的，汪记的，等等。他们要破坏韬奋的活动，自不待言。香港政府自然也不会欢迎韬奋这样一个人来办刊物，不过，既然还标榜着“言论自由”，就不好公然不许，而只能在刊物登记的条例上做文章；照那条例，刊物的负责者是发行人，而发行人则须是“港绅”，因而韬奋当然不能自任发行人去申请登记，而必须另找一位港绅来“合作”，但即使找到了那样一位，能不能通过，据说也很少把握。
    所谓“有志者事竟成”罢，韬奋终于找到一位发行人了。原来有一个曹先生（他的父亲是所谓港绅），早已登记好了要办一个周刊，但因找不到适当的主编，故而那刊物还没出世。这位曹先生年纪还青，读过韬奋的著作及其所编的刊物，可以说是对于韬奋的道德文章有相当认识、对于韬奋怀着敬佩之心的一个人。经过第三者的介绍，事情就成功了。这就是后来坚持到香港沦陷然后停刊的“大众生活”周刊，从这件事，也可见韬奋的为祖国为人民的长期奋斗的精神和毅力，在一般人中间（而曹先生是其中之一）建立了如何高的威信！
    办刊物既有眉目，韬奋立刻以他那一贯的负责和不知疲倦的精神开始工作。他要求在两星期后出版创刊号，那就是说，一星期后就必须将创刊号的稿件发排。他组织了一个编辑委员会，可是参加编委会的朋友们都是另有工作的，他们对于韬奋的帮助只能是：每星期开会一次，决定下一期刊物的主要内容，并在这范围内担任写稿一篇，或者是负责向编委以外的朋友拉一篇那一期刊物所需要的稿。韬奋必须自己做的，就有下列的一大堆事情：每期登在卷首的社评，那是有一定的篇幅的，太长或太短都会影响到刊物的整个编排的计划性；审阅来稿（包括特约稿和外来的投稿）；给读者的来信作“简复”，这是刊物的很重要的一栏，刊物与读者的联系固然赖此一栏，而尤其重要的，是借这一栏发表一些还不宜于用其他方式（例如短评等等）来发表的主张或批评。不曾在那种环境下办过刊物的人不会了解“简复”读者来信这工作在彼时彼地是怎样重要而且又是怎样地不简单。韬奋常说：他花在“简复”上的时间和精力，比花在社评上的要多得多。
    在那时的人力物力的条件下办这么一个周刊，其困难有非今天的没有那种经验的年青朋友所能想像。“大众生活”之所以得以出版，并且在短促的时期内出版，不能不归功于韬奋的毅力和勤奋。当时在香港的朋友们中间颇有几位是办过刊物的，当听说刊物要在一星期内从无到有，都感觉期限太促，然而韬奋那种说干就干、勇往直前的精神，把大家振奋起来了。韬奋是对的。那时候，即使是一天的时间也很宝贵，不能白白过去。那时候，如果迟疑拖延，则夜长梦多，刊物也许会因特务分子的破坏而终于不能出世。如果不把这些特殊情况加以充分的估计，而轻率地武断地以为韬奋就是“性急”，（有人是这样看他的，而他自己也这样自讼），是“顾前不顾后”，或者，因而给他一个“急躁冒进”的帽子。那是全无是处的。
    恰恰相反，我倒觉得韬奋的嫉恶如仇、说干就干、充满信心、极端负责的精神，正是我们应当学习的。
    至于韬奋的思想发展的过程，——他的如何从
  一个旧民主主义者发展而成为共产主义者的过程，我在这里不想多说。从韬奋身上，又一度证明了凡是有正义感、爱祖国、爱人类、爱真理的旧民主主义者，在斗争的考验中，是会走上信仰共产主义的道路的，中外皆然；这已是历史发展的规律。
