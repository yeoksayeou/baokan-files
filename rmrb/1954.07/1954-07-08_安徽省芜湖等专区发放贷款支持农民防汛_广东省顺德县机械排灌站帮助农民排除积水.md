    Anhui Province's Wuhu and Other Special Districts Issue Loans to Support Farmers in Flood Prevention
    Mechanical Irrigation and Drainage Stations in Shunde County, Guangdong Province, Help Farmers Eliminate Waterlogging
    People's Banks in Wuhu, Anqing, and Lu'an Special Districts of Anhui Province promptly issued large amounts of loans to support farmers in flood prevention and drainage. The People's Bank of Anqing Special District invested all seventy billion yuan of outstanding loans in the disaster area. The Lu'an Special District has already issued several tens of billions of yuan in special funds for flood prevention, drainage, and replanting. The Wuhu Special District adjusted the agricultural loan funds of various counties according to the needs of flood prevention and drainage.

    The People's Banks in these areas generally adopted methods such as taking money to the countryside to quickly issue loans to areas along the Yangtze River. After the Da Nong Township of Wusha District in Guichi County suffered from waterlogging, the difficulties of lacking oil for water pumps were solved due to timely loans from the state bank, and more than 2,500 mu of rice fields were rescued from danger. The Langxi County People's Bank promptly issued more than 56 million yuan in flood prevention loans to help farmers defend seven large and small dikes, saving more than 19,000 mu of farmland from flooding. Some seedlings rotted in the Sanjue District of Shou County. After local farmers received loans from the bank, they purchased 43,000 jin of rice seeds and replanted them in a timely manner.

    Mechanical irrigation and drainage stations in Shunde County, Guangdong Province, actively helped farmers eliminate waterlogging, saving more than 8,000 mu of seedlings from damage. At the beginning of June, when the second flood peak arrived, the sluice gates in various parts of Shunde County were closed. However, due to excessive rainfall, the severely waterlogged rice fields in the first, second, third, and tenth districts reached more than 8,100 mu. They were soaked for eight or nine consecutive days. As the flood did not recede and the gates could not be opened for drainage, the farmers were very anxious. The mechanical irrigation and drainage station immediately dispatched all technicians and mobilized 23 water pumps to go to various districts for round-the-clock drainage and rescue. By mid-June, the waterlogging of more than 8,000 mu of rice fields had been completely eliminated. Now most of the rice has headed, and it can be harvested in another twenty days, without reducing production.

    安徽省芜湖等专区发放贷款支持农民防汛
    广东省顺德县机械排灌站帮助农民排除积水
    安徽省芜湖、安庆、六安等专区的人民银行及时发放大批贷款，支持农民防汛排涝。安庆专区的人民银行把还没有发放的七十亿元贷款全部投入灾区；六安专区已发放了几十亿元防汛、排涝、补种的专款。芜湖专区将各县农贷资金按照防汛排涝的需要，进行了调剂。
    这些地区的人民银行一般都采取携款下乡等办法，到沿江等地区迅速发放贷款。贵池县乌沙区大农乡发生内涝以后，由于及时得到国家银行的贷款，解决了抽水机缺油的困难，二千五百多亩稻田得以抢救出险。郎溪县人民银行及时发放了防汛贷款五千六百多万元，帮助农民守住大小圩堤七处，使一万九千多亩田地免受水淹。寿县三觉区曾烂掉一部分秧苗，当地农民得到银行贷款以后，购买了四万三千斤稻种，及时进行了补种。

    广东省顺德县机械排灌站积极帮助农民排除积水，使八千多亩禾苗免受损失。六月初旬，第二次洪峰到来时，顺德县各地都把水闸关闭了。但因雨水过多，第一、二、三、十等区严重积水的禾田达八千一百多亩，一连浸了八九天，洪水未退，又不能开闸排水，农民非常焦急。机械排灌站当即派出全体技工，出动了二十三台抽水机，分往各区日夜进行排水抢救。至六月中旬，八千多亩禾田的积水全部排除。现在稻禾大部分已抽穗，再过二十天便可收获，不致减产。
