    The first session of the first People's Congress of Urumqi City was held from June 29th to July 6th. At the meeting, after listening to the report on the content of the draft constitution, the representatives studied and discussed it article by article. Worker representative Maimaiti Sike (Uyghur) said: "In the old society, I worked as a laborer for an official for thirteen years, and he didn't give me a penny. I went to the pseudo-government to file a complaint, but the pseudo-county magistrate said it was a false accusation and drove me out. The laws of the old society were laws used by a few rulers to exploit and oppress the common people." Representatives of various ethnic minorities carefully studied the section on autonomous organs in ethnic autonomous regions. He Xiuzhen (Xibe) said: "In the past, our Xibe people were looked down upon, and the reactionaries deliberately created ethnic disputes, preventing us from living and working in peace. After liberation, the Ningxi County, where the Xibe people live in concentrated communities, established a Xibe Autonomous Region equivalent to a county. The various ethnic groups are very united, and our Xibe people have made great progress in politics, economy, and culture." Women representative Cui Yongxiu said: "Who regarded us women as human beings in the old society? After liberation, I was selected as a model worker, and now I have been selected as a representative to the Municipal People's Congress. This fully proves that the rights of women and men in politics, economy, and culture stipulated in the draft constitution are equal." Representatives from all walks of life from the Han, Uyghur, Kazakh, Russian, Hui, and other ethnic groups also spoke at the meeting, using the facts after liberation to illustrate the greatness and correctness of the draft constitution, and expressing their intention to strengthen ethnic unity and build a great motherland in the future. Then, the representatives unanimously passed a resolution endorsing the draft constitution. The meeting also elected representatives to attend the Xinjiang Provincial People's Congress meeting, carefully reviewed and discussed the work report of the Municipal People's Government, and determined the future work tasks of Urumqi City. During the meeting, a total of 992 proposals were received from representatives of various ethnic groups.

    乌鲁木齐市举行人民代表大会会议
    讨论宪法草案并确定今后工作任务
    乌鲁木齐市首届第一次人民代表大会会议在六月二十九日到七月六日举行。会上，代表们听了关于宪法草案内容说明的报告后，便逐条进行研究和讨论。工人代表买买提司的克（维吾尔族）说：“在旧社会里我给一个当官的做了十三年苦工，他没有给我一个钱。我到伪衙门去告状，伪县长说是诬告，把我赶出来了，旧社会的法律就是少数统治者剥削压迫老百姓的法律。”各少数民族代表特别仔细地研究了民族自治地方的自治机关一节。何秀珍
  （锡伯族）说：“过去我们锡伯族被人瞧不起，反动派故意制造民族纠纷，使我们不能安居乐业。解放后锡伯族聚居的宁西县成立了相当县一级的锡伯族自治区，各民族团结得很好，我们锡伯族的政治、经济、文化都有了很大发展。”妇女代表崔永秀说：旧社会谁把我们妇女当人看呢，解放后我被选为劳动模范，现在又被选为市人民代表大会的代表，这就充分证明宪法草案规定的妇女和男子在政治、经济、文化上的权利是一律平等的。在会上发言的还有汉、维吾尔、哈萨克、俄罗斯、回等民族的各界代表，都分别以解放后的事实说明宪法草案的伟大和正确，表示今后更要加强民族团结，建设伟大的祖国。然后，代表们一致通过了拥护宪法草案的决议。会议还选举了出席新疆省人民代表大会会议的代表，认真审查和讨论了市人民政府的工作报告，确定了乌鲁木齐市今后的工作任务。会议期间共收到各民族代表的提案九百九十二件。（新华社）
