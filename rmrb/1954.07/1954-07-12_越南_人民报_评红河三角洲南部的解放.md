Xinhua News Agency, July 10th: The Vietnamese Labor Party's official newspaper, "The People's Daily," published an editorial entitled "Another Significant Victory for Our Army and People," stating: "At the end of June and the beginning of July this year, the enemy forces were forced to withdraw from the southern part of the Red River Delta. This area from which the enemy forces were compelled to withdraw includes the provincial capitals of Nam Dinh, Thai Binh, Ninh Binh, and Ha Nam provinces, as well as Phat Diem in Ninh Binh province and Bui Chu in Nam Dinh province, where Catholics are concentrated. Not long ago, the enemy forces were forced to withdraw from Viet Tri city and some isolated strongholds on the left and right banks of the Red River."

The editorial stated that the newly liberated area is a rich granary with a population of over two million, and includes Nam Dinh, the largest city in North Vietnam after Hanoi and Haiphong. It connects North and Central Vietnam. From an economic, political, and military perspective, it is an important region.

The editorial, when discussing the reasons for the enemy's withdrawal from the southern Red River Delta, stated: "After the Winter-Spring Campaign (especially after the Dien Bien Phu Campaign), the enemy clearly recognized the constantly increasing strength of the Vietnamese army and people, and the continuous weakening of their own forces. The enemy knew that it was impossible to continue defending the areas under their control, while also being under significant pressure from the Vietnamese People's Army. Therefore, they had no choice but to withdraw from the southern Red River Delta to avoid being surrounded on all sides and suffering complete annihilation, as happened at Dien Bien Phu."

The editorial pointed out: "The liberation of the southern Red River Delta is a great victory for the Vietnamese army and people, following the victory at Dien Bien Phu."

    越南“人民报”评红河三角洲南部的解放
    【新华社十日讯】据越南通讯社九日讯：越南劳动党机关报“人民报”以“我国军民的又一重大胜利”为题发表社论说：今年六月底和七月初，敌军被迫从红河三角洲的南部撤退。敌军被迫撤离的这一地区包括南定、太平、宁平、河南等四省的省会以及天主教徒聚居的宁平省的发艳和南定省的裴朱。不久前，敌军曾被迫撤离越池城和红河左、右两岸的一些陷于孤立的据点。
    社论说，这个新解放区是一个富饶的谷仓，拥有二百几十万人口，并有在北越仅次于河内和海防的最大城市南定。它连接着北越和中越。从经济、政治和军事方面来看，它都是一个重要的地区。
    社论在谈到敌军撤离红河三角洲南部的原因时说：在冬春战役以后（特别是在奠边府战役以后），敌人已清楚地认识到越南军民不断增长的力量以及他们自己的部队的不断减弱。敌人知道已无法继续防守自己所控制的地区，同时又受到越南人民军的重大压力。因此，他们不得不撤离红河三角洲的南部，以避免像奠边府一样四面受围而致全军覆没。
    社论指出：红河三角洲南部的解放是越南军民继奠边府胜利以后的一个巨大的胜利。
