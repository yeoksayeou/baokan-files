Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, July 15th: At the Military Armistice Commission on July 14th, our chief delegate, Lieutenant General Li Xiangchao, once again protested against the US side's violation of the armistice agreement by continuously dispatching military personnel to intrude into our area for hostile acts.

Lieutenant General Li Xiangchao pointed out: On May 31st, the US Far East Air Force 6006 Unit, the South Korean Air Force 5392 Unit, and the 20th Special Service Agency dispatched Jin Qiangshi and Shi Xiongjie, two members of the special service agency, to our area for hostile acts. On May 31st, they illegally entered the demilitarized zone under the leadership of officers from the aforementioned US special service agency and officers from the Wenzhen detachment. On June 1st, they illegally crossed the military demarcation line and intruded into the vicinity of Powaeri in the demilitarized zone under our jurisdiction, where they were arrested by our civil police. On June 5th, members of both sides of the 6th Joint Observer Group of the Military Armistice Commission conducted a joint investigation, interrogated the two captured US military personnel, and examined various physical evidences, which fully confirmed the aforementioned facts.

Lieutenant General Li Xiangchao further pointed out: Since the armistice, the US side has continuously dispatched its military personnel to illegally intrude into the demilitarized zone under our jurisdiction and our military control area to carry out hostile acts. Our side has listed the facts and protested to the US side. The US side not only did not change, but intensified its illegal activities in violation of the armistice agreement. In addition to the aforementioned US violation of the armistice agreement on June 1st, in just six days from July 1st to 6th, our side successively captured four groups of military personnel dispatched by the US side who intruded into the demilitarized zone under our jurisdiction and our military control area to carry out hostile acts, including Jin Shuxi, Pei Changhuan, Wu Shunhua, Li Zhongguo, and others dispatched by the US Far East Air Force 6006 Unit and 8240 Unit's Special Service Team, and the US Far East Command 8112 Unit's Seoul detachment. The US side must immediately stop this behavior that violates the armistice agreement, severely punish relevant personnel in accordance with the armistice agreement, and guarantee that similar incidents will not occur in the future.

At the meeting on July 14th, the US side, on the one hand, disregarded the facts and categorically denied its aforementioned actions in violation of the armistice agreement. On the other hand, it fabricated unfounded accusations that our personnel opened fire on US civil police patrol boats in the Han River estuary. The US side even openly claimed that US personnel will take action against our personnel in the demilitarized zone in the future under the pretext of so-called "self-defense," using "all available means."

Lieutenant General Li Xiangchao refuted the US side's accusations at the meeting by citing facts, and solemnly pointed out: The results of our internal investigation and the joint investigation conducted by members of both sides of the First Joint Observer Group of the Military Armistice Commission both proved that the aforementioned US accusations were groundless. The reason why the US side made this unfounded accusation and even openly carried out provocative intimidation is not only an attempt to cover up the fact that the US side has continuously conducted hostile acts in the demilitarized zone and our military control area in violation of the armistice agreement since the armistice, but also to try its best to destabilize the Korean armistice after the US side undermined the discussions on the Korean issue at the Geneva Conference, to cooperate with the clamor of those warmongers who are bent on destroying the Korean armistice, to create a tense situation, and to create excuses for the US side to further violate the armistice agreement and carry out provocations in the demilitarized zone and the Han River estuary area in the future.

Lieutenant General Li Xiangchao finally pointed out: The armistice agreement was signed by both parties, and the US side has an inescapable obligation to strictly abide by all the provisions of the armistice agreement. The US side must bear full responsibility for the consequences of any actions that violate the armistice agreement.

    李相朝中将在朝鲜军事停战委员会上
    抗议美方不断派遣军事人员侵入我方地区
    【新华社开城十五日电】在七月十四日的军事停战委员会上，我方首席委员李相朝中将再一次抗议美方违反停战协定，不断派遣军事人员侵入我方地区进行敌对行为。
    李相朝中将指出：五月三十一日，美国远东空军六零零六部队南朝鲜空军五三九二部队二零特务机关，派遣该特务机关的成员金锵式、石雄杰两名前来我方地区进行敌对行为。他们于五月三十一日在美方上述特务机关军官与驻文津派遣队的军官的带领下非法进入非军事区，于六月一日非法越过军事分界线，侵入我方管辖下的非军事区浦外津里附近，为我方民政警察逮捕。六月五日，军事停战委员会第六联合观察小组的双方成员进行了共同调查，讯问了该两名被捕的美方军事人员，检查了各种物证，充分证实了上述事实。
    李相朝中将进一步指出：自停战以来，美方曾不断派遣其军事人员非法侵入我方管辖下的非军事区与我方军事控制地区进行敌对行为，我方曾列举事实向美方提出抗议，美方不但不改，反而变本加厉地继续进行此等违反停战协定的非法勾当。除上述六月一日的美方违反停战协定的事件外，仅在七月一日至六日的六天中，我方即曾先后捕获由美方派遣侵入我方管辖下的非军事区与我方军事控制地区进行敌对行为的军事人员四批，其中包括美国远东空军六零零六部队和八二四零部队的特务队、远东美军司令部八一一二部队汉城市派遣队等机关所派遣的美方军事人员金硕熙、裴昌焕、吴顺花、李钟国等。美方必须立即停止这种违反停战协定的行为，依照停战协定严惩有关人员，并保证今后不再发生类似事件。
    美方在七月十四日会上一方面不顾事实，矢口抵赖其上述违反停战协定的行为，另一方面则无中生有、毫无事实根据地诬控我方人员在汉江口开枪射击美方民政警察的巡逻船只，美方甚至公然声称，美方人员今后将在非军事区内以所谓“自卫”为名，用“一切可以使用的办法”向我方人员采取行动。
    李相朝中将在会上引用事实驳斥了美方的诬控，并严正指出：我方所进行的内部调查及军事停战委员会第一联合观察小组双方成员进行共同调查的结果，均证明美方的上述指控毫无根据。美方所以提出这一毫无根据的诬控，甚至公开进行挑衅性的恫吓，不但是企图要掩盖停战以来美方不断向非军事区与我方军事控制地区进行敌对行为的违反停战协定的事实，而且是为了要在美方破坏了日内瓦会议关于朝鲜问题的讨论之后，竭力企图使朝鲜停战处于不稳定的状态，配合那些一心要破坏朝鲜停战的好战分子的叫嚣，制造紧张局势，并为美方今后在非军事区与汉江口区域进一步违反停战协定、进行挑衅制造借口。
    李相朝中将最后指出：停战协定是双方签订的，美方有不容逃避的义务严格遵守停战协定的一切规定，美方对于其违反停战协定的任何行动所产生的后果必须承担全部责任。
