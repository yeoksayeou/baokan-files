The Geneva Conference has reached an agreement on the restoration of peace in Indochina. This major achievement is conducive to the easing of international tensions and helps the peaceful coexistence and security between Asian countries and the rest of the world. This is a great victory for all peace-loving people in the world and a great contribution of the Geneva Conference to the cause of peace.

The Indochina peace agreement eloquently proves that international disputes can be resolved peacefully through peaceful consultations, and that the path of peace and sincere consultation is the way to resolve international disputes. The policy of strength, advocated by U.S. imperialism to resolve issues by force, is a failed path and a bankrupt policy.

One of the biggest features of the Geneva Conference is that the People's Republic of China participated for the first time as one of the world's five major powers, consulting with major powers on major international issues. Although U.S. imperialism has tried to obstruct and undermine the important role our country plays in resolving international issues, or foolishly refuses to recognize our country's status as a major power, the fact proves that without the participation of the People's Republic of China, it is impossible to resolve any major global, especially Asian, issues; the era when Asian affairs were decided by people outside of Asia has passed. The outstanding contributions made by our delegation headed by Premier Zhou Enlai at the Geneva Conference demonstrate to the people of the world the correctness and greatness of our peaceful foreign policy, have won the common praise of world opinion, and have greatly enhanced our country's international status. It is universally recognized that the People's Republic of China is one of the world's major powers, which is by no means accidental. We feel extremely excited and honored. We express our high respect to our delegation for its brilliant achievements.

International peace is a necessary condition for promoting economic and cultural exchanges between countries. During the Geneva Conference, countries eagerly expressed their desire to develop trade relations and economic exchanges with our country. The Chinese people have always loved peace. We hope to coexist peacefully with all countries and welcome the development of economic and trade relations with all countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. We believe that due to the ceasefire in Indochina and the easing of international tensions, and due to the growth of peaceful forces in the world, these demands and wishes that have already begun to be realized will be further developed and expanded, and will also further promote the rise of peaceful forces.

The cessation of the Indochina war once again shows that peace has triumphed over war. However, we also clearly know that the enemies of peace will never give up. U.S. imperialism is still attempting to organize a Southeast Asian aggressive bloc, still occupies our country's Taiwan, and is still supporting the reactionary remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek gang. In order to consolidate peace and develop peace, we must strengthen our vigilance and accelerate the construction of our strong motherland. We must strive to resolutely recover Taiwan and defend Asian and world peace. Our national industrial and commercial circles should unite more closely around the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, carry forward the spirit of patriotism, work hard in production and management, actively realize socialist transformation, and strive to accelerate the construction of our prosperous, strong, and happy motherland!

    中华全国工商联主任委员陈叔通的谈话
    日内瓦会议关于印度支那恢复和平问题已达成协议。这个重大成就，有利于国际紧张局势的缓和，有助于亚洲与世界各国间的和平相处和安全。这是全世界爱好和平的人民的一大胜利，也是日内瓦会议对于和平事业的巨大贡献。
    印度支那恢复和平的协议，雄辩地证明通过和平协商是可以和平解决国际争端的，证明和平与诚意协商的道路是解决国际争端的道路。美帝国主义叫嚣武力解决的实力政策，是失败的道路，也是破产的政策。
    日内瓦会议的最大特点之一，是中华人民共和国第一次以世界五大国之一的身份，和各大国一起协商重大国际问题。尽管美帝国主义力谋阻挠和破坏我国在解决国际问题中所起的重大作用，或愚蠢地不承认我国的大国地位，但是事实证明，如果没有中华人民共和国参加，要解决任何世界的特别是亚洲的重大问题是不可能的；亚洲的事由亚洲以外的人去决定的时代已经过去了。在日内瓦会议中以周总理为首的我国代表团所作的卓越贡献，在全世界人民面前表明我们和平外交政策的正确伟大，取得了世界舆论的共同赞扬，我国国际地位的大大提高，举世公认中华人民共和国为世界大国之一，这决不是偶然的，我们感到极大的兴奋和光荣。我们对我国代表团的辉煌成就，表示崇高的敬意。
    国际间的和平，是促进各国间的经济和文化交流的必要条件，在日内瓦会议期间，各国热切表现出要求与我国发展贸易关系和经济交流的愿望。中国人民是一贯爱好和平的，我们希望与一切国家和平共处，欢迎在平等互利的基础上与一切国家发展经济、贸易关系。我们相信，由于印度支那的停战和国际紧张局势的缓和，由于世界人民和平力量的增长，这些已经开始实现的要求和愿望，将更进一步地发展和扩大，同时也更促进和平力量的高涨。
    印度支那战争的停止，又一次表明了和平战胜了战争。但是，我们也清楚地知道，和平的敌人决不会从此罢休。美帝国主义还企图组织东南亚侵略集团，还侵占我国台湾，还在扶植蒋匪帮的反动残余。为了巩固和平，发展和平，我们要加强警惕，加紧地建设我们强大的祖国。为坚决收复台湾保卫亚洲和世界和平而奋斗。我们全国工商界应和全国人民一道更紧密地团结在中国共产党和毛主席的周围，发挥爱国主义精神，努力生产经营，积极实现社会主义改造，为加紧建设我们繁荣、强大、幸福的祖国而努力！　　　（新华社）
