    Peaceful Negotiation Will Surely Defeat Military Solution
    He Xiangning
    The Geneva Conference has come to a successful conclusion, and the eight-year-long Indochina War has come to an end. This is another victory of great historical significance for peace-loving people all over the world, following the Korean armistice. This victory is of great significance for promoting collective peace and security in Asia and for further easing international tensions.
    The agreement on the Indochina issue proves that the principles of peaceful negotiation and peaceful coexistence will surely defeat the policy of strength and military solutions. Facts have proved that under the current international situation, any international dispute can be resolved through peaceful negotiation; and the conspiracy to use force to resolve international disputes is a "dead end."
    The Delegation of the People's Republic of China, headed by Premier and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai, participated in the Geneva Conference and made constructive efforts for the achievement of the agreement in line with our government's consistent peaceful foreign policy. Without the participation and efforts of the People's Republic of China, the Geneva Conference could not have achieved today's results. The international status of the People's Republic of China as one of the world's major powers has been universally recognized, and any attempt to obliterate and resist it will inevitably be futile. Our people are delighted and encouraged by the achievements and efforts of our delegation.
    During the Geneva Conference, Premier Zhou Enlai visited India and Burma, and issued joint statements with the Prime Ministers of India and Burma respectively. These two statements pointed out that Asian countries should conduct consultations and cooperation with each other on the basis of the Five Principles of mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful co-existence. If all countries can adopt these principles as the criteria for getting along with each other, then peace in Asia and the world will certainly be consolidated.
    U.S. imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of peace. It has occupied our country's territory of Taiwan, provoked the Korean War, and interfered in the Indochina War. From the first day of the Geneva Conference to its closing, the United States has been constantly obstructing and undermining it, but "those who have the Tao receive much assistance, while those who are without it receive little." This perverse act of U.S. imperialism violates the interests of the people all over the world and is unpopular. Therefore, at the Geneva Conference, it suffered a shameful defeat and isolation. This is the inevitable result of "those who are without the Tao receiving little assistance." In the future, we should also be more vigilant and pay attention to the U.S. conspiracy to undermine the Indochina agreement so that peace in Indochina can be lasting and consolidated.
    Finally, I hope that overseas Chinese will live in peace with the local people, unite in friendship, be equal and mutually beneficial, and help each other; and that the people of the whole country will unite more closely around Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party to build and defend the motherland. "Those who have the Tao receive much assistance." Our country's peaceful policy has been sympathized with and cheered by peace-loving people all over the world. Let us, together with the people of the world, continue to work more firmly to safeguard and consolidate world peace. Peace will surely triumph throughout the world. July 22, 1954

    和平协商一定战胜武力解决
    何香凝
    日内瓦会议已经圆满闭幕了，历时八年的印度支那战争宣告结束了，这是全世界爱好和平的人民，继朝鲜停战之后，又一具有重大历史意义的胜利，这一胜利，对于促进亚洲的集体和平与安全，对于进一步缓和国际紧张局势，是有很大意义的。
    印度支那问题协议的达成，证明和平协商与和平共处的原则，一定战胜实力政策与武力解决。事实证明，在目前国际形势下，任何国际争端都可以通过和平协商的方式加以解决；而妄想用武力解决国际争端的阴谋，是“此路不通”的。
    以周恩来总理兼外长为首的中华人民共和国 代表团，参加了日内瓦会议，本着我国政府一贯的和平外交政策，对协议的达成作了建设性的努力。没有中华人民共和国的参加和努力，日内瓦会议要取得今天的成就是不可能的。中华人民共和国作为世界大国之一的国际地位已为举世所公认，任何人企图加以抹煞和抵制必然是徒劳的。我国人民对我国代表团的成就和努力感到欢欣鼓舞。
    在日内瓦会议期间，周恩来总理访问了印度和缅甸，并与印、缅两国总理分别发表联合声明，这两个声明指出了亚洲国家彼此之间应该本着互相尊重领土主权、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利、和平共处的五项原则，进行协商和合作。如果各个国家都能本着这些原则作为彼此相处的准则，那末，亚洲和世界的和平，一定是能够得到巩固的。
    美帝国主义是和平的最凶恶的敌人，它侵占了我国的领土台湾，挑起了朝鲜战争，并且干涉印度支那战争。从日内瓦会议开幕的第一天起一直到会议闭幕，美国总是不断地进行阻挠和破坏，但是“得道者多助，失道者寡助”，美帝国主义的这种倒行逆施，是违反全世界人民利益的，是不得人心的，所以在日内瓦会议中，遭到了可耻的失败和孤立，这是“失道者寡助”的必然结果。今后我们还应提高警惕，注视美国破坏印度支那协议的阴谋，使印度支那的和平能够得到持久和巩固。
    最后，我希望国外华侨和当地人民和平共处，团结友好，平等互惠，互助互济；全国人民更紧密地团结在毛主席和中国共产党的周围，建设祖国和保卫祖国。“得道者多助”，我国的和平政策已经得到全世界爱好和平人民的同情和欢呼。让我们和全世界人民一道，更坚定地继续为维护和巩固世界和平而努力，和平一定在全世界胜利。一九五四年七月二十二日
