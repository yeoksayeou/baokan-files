Jilin Province has basically completed the first plowing and weeding and rice transplanting by July 6th, with nearly 450,000 hectares of land plowed and weeded a second time. Yanbian region, which is progressing faster, has had more than 20,000 hectares of millet plowed and weeded three times, and 5,000 hectares of millet plowed and weeded four times. At present, some cooperatives and groups have begun topdressing.

During the summer weeding, all localities paid attention to mobilizing all rural labor to participate. According to statistics from six counties including Nong'an, Jiutai, and Guoqian Banner alone, more than 134,000 women participated in the summer weeding. Yushu County had only weeded 160,000 hectares of land by June 28th, but after mobilizing all the labor force to participate in the summer weeding, the first plowing and weeding of the entire county has been completed, more than 90,000 hectares have been plowed and weeded a second time, and more than 220,000 hectares have been plowed. Most cooperatives and groups have paid attention to the quality of weeding. The first plowing and weeding completed by the Dongfanghong Cooperative in Panshi Third District basically achieved the goals of no grass around seedling roots, no damage to seedlings, no seedlings being pressed down, and no "white caps" (unweeded patches).

    吉林省夏锄工作基本结束
    吉林省到七月六日止，铲?头遍地和水田插秧工作已基本结束，并有近四十五万垧地铲完二遍。进度较快的延边地区已有两万多垧谷子铲完三遍，五千垧谷子铲完四遍。目前部分社、组已开始追肥。
    在夏锄中，各地注意发动农村所有劳力参加，仅据农安、九台、郭前旗等六个县统计，参加夏锄的妇女有十三万四千多人。榆树县到六月二十八日只铲出十六万垧地，可是经过发动所有的劳力参加夏锄后，现在全县头遍地已结束，二遍地已铲出九万多垧，并?出二十二万多垧。大部分社、组都注意了铲?质量。磐石三区东方红社铲完的头遍地，基本达到了苗根没草、没伤苗、压苗，没有“白盖子”。
