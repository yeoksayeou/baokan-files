American imperialism, under the pretext of an accidental incident involving a British transport plane, openly dispatched a mixed fleet including two aircraft carriers and several destroyers on July 26th, entering the sea area near the eastern part of Hainan Island in our country. American fighter planes took off from the ships in two batches and intruded into the airspace over Yulin Port and Lehui in our country. In the airspace over Lehui, they attacked two of our patrol planes, shooting down both. Subsequently, two more American fighter planes made dive-bombing and strafing runs on two Polish merchant ships and our escort vessel. The Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs of our Central People's Government, Zhang Hanfu, has lodged the most serious protest with the U.S. government regarding this unbridled act of aggression by American imperialism against our country. The people of our country fully support the just condemnation and protest of our government against the American aggressors, and feel extreme indignation at the American aggression.

This reckless action by the American imperialists is clearly a manifestation of the U.S. war-mongering clique's stubborn adherence to its policy of expanding aggression against our country. American imperialism is hostile to the people of our country, occupies our territory of Taiwan, and attempts to use the remaining bandit gang of Chiang Kai-shek in Taiwan as a tool for conducting aggressive adventures against our country. This arrogant and tyrannical practice of American imperialism is one of the fundamental reasons for the tense situation in Asia. Recently, due to the holding of the Geneva Conference and the glorious agreement reached on the restoration of peace in Indochina, the situation in Asia and the entire international situation has been further eased. This has caused unease and panic among the U.S. war-mongering clique. In order to maintain and create new tensions in Asia, the United States, since the holding of the Geneva Conference, has on the one hand dispatched Van Fleet and others to the Far East to actively carry out aggressive deployments, and on the other hand, instigated and supported the remaining bandit gang of Chiang Kai-shek to intensify their piratical activities of intercepting merchant ships on the high seas of the Far East. It has also dispatched planes of the remaining bandit gang of Chiang Kai-shek to continuously harass the coastal areas and islands of our country. During this period, in addition to stepping up the activities of its Seventh Fleet, the United States has also sent ships from the First Fleet from the United States to the Far Eastern waters. These lawless actions of American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang have created unrest on the high seas of the Far East and seriously threatened the security of our country.

The incident involving the British transport plane was an accidental event that occurred under such circumstances created by the United States. In his reply on July 26th to the British Chargé d'Affaires, Mr. D.W.H. William, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs of our Central People's Government, Zhang Hanfu, has explained the matter and expressed regret, while also expressing willingness to consider providing appropriate pensions and compensation for the loss of life and property involved. The attitude of our government in handling this matter is reasonable and justified. However, the American warmongers have actually made a big fuss about this, attempting to stir up trouble and expand the incident. In a statement issued on July 24th, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles openly stated that the United States had ordered the dispatch of two aircraft carriers to "rush to" the sea off Hainan Island in our country, and said: "The actions to be taken by the United States will be announced later." The American propaganda machine has even more exaggeratedly claimed that the British transport plane incident was "the most serious Far East incident," and reactionary American congressmen have also clamored that the United States "should not stand idly by." Facts have proven that the American warmongers are trying to use the British transport plane incident as an excuse to openly provoke our country and expand their military activities in the southern coastal areas of China.

However, any excuse sought by the U.S. government for taking such aggressive and provocative actions is extremely despicable. The accidental and unfortunate incident of the British transport plane is being reasonably resolved between China and Britain through diplomatic channels. The United States is not allowed to take the opportunity to intervene and deliberately create a serious armed conflict. British Foreign Secretary Eden has already welcomed the reasonable attitude of our government in handling the British plane incident. The editorial published by the British "Manchester Guardian" on the 27th believes that the American intervention is a "provocative act" and expresses concern about this. It is not difficult for people to see that the unreasonable actions of the United States prove how eager it is to expand aggression against the People's Republic of China, create a tense situation, and thereby provoke the improving Sino-British relations. This is an extremely arrogant act by American warmongers against normal international relations and the security and peace of all countries.

Amidst a wave of hysterical clamor, the American propaganda machine cannot conceal their sinister purpose of deliberately distorting the facts and seeking trouble. A United Press International dispatch from London on the 25th admitted that the British plane incident was a "misunderstanding"; however, the same agency's Washington dispatch on the same day, in reporting Dulles' provocative statement, said that Washington's "diplomats believe that this incident has special significance because it occurred immediately after the Geneva Conference arranged for the ceasefire in Indochina," and "it is expected that the United States will use this incident as an excuse to strive to organize a Southeast Asian defense system with other free countries." From this, it can be seen to what extent the aggressive actions of the American ruling clique have become frantic.

The Chinese people and peace-loving people and fair-minded public opinion all over the world have expressed condemnation for the criminal act of the U.S. Air Force in violating our country's airspace and suddenly attacking and shooting down two of our aircraft and diving and strafing our ships in the most barbaric manner. The Chinese people fully support the serious warning from the Central People's Government to the U.S. government: The U.S. government should immediately stop such acts of aggression, otherwise, the U.S. government must bear all the responsibilities caused by its provocation and will reap what it sows!

### 美帝国主义狂妄的侵略和挑衅

    美帝国主义狂妄的侵略和挑衅
    美国政府借口一架英国运输机的意外事件，公然于七月二十六日派遣包括航空母舰两艘及驱逐舰若干艘的混合编队，进入我国海南岛东部附近海面，由舰上起飞的美国战斗机两批侵入了我国榆林港和乐会上空，在乐会上空向我国两架巡逻机攻击，我两机被其击落，其后，又有美国战斗机两架向两艘波兰商轮及我国护航舰进行了俯冲射击。对于美帝国主义对我国的这一肆无忌惮的侵略暴行，我中央人民政府外交部副部长章汉夫已向美国政府提出最严重的抗议。我国人民完全支持我国政府对美国侵略者的正义谴责和抗议，并对美国的侵略暴行感到极大的愤怒。
    美帝国主义者的这种疯狂行动，显然是美国好战集团顽固地奉行其扩大侵略我国政策的表现。美帝国主义敌视我国人民，侵占了我国的领土台湾，并企图利用台湾蒋介石残余匪帮作为对我国进行侵略冒险的工具。美帝国主义的这种狂妄横暴的做法，是造成亚洲紧张形势的根本原因之一。最近以来，由于日内瓦会议的举行及关于恢复印度支那和平达成了光荣的协议，亚洲及整个国际形势获得进一步的缓和，这引起了美国好战集团的不安和恐慌。为了在亚洲保持和制造新的紧张局势，美国在日内瓦会议举行以来，一面派遣范佛里特等人到远东积极进行侵略部署，一面指使和支持蒋介石残余匪帮在远东公海加紧其拦劫商船的海盗活动，并派遣蒋介石残余匪帮的飞机不断对我国沿海地区和岛屿进行骚扰。在此期间，美国除了加紧它的第七舰队的活动以外，又从美国增派了第一舰队的舰只到远东海面活动。美帝国主义和蒋匪帮的这种无法无天的行动，造成了远东公海的不安，并严重威胁我国的安全。
    英国运输机的事件，就是美国所造成的这种形势下发生的一件意外的事件。我国中央人民政府外交部章汉夫副部长在七月二十六日给英国代办杜维廉的复照中已对这件事情作了说明，并表示遗憾，同时对有关生命及财产的损失表示愿意考虑给予适当的抚恤与赔偿。我国政府处理这一件事的态度是合情合理的。但是，美国好战分子却竟然借此大嚷大叫，企图兴风作浪，扩大事端。美国国务卿杜勒斯在七月二十四日发表的声明中，就公然说美国已下令派遣两艘航空母舰“驰赴”我国海南岛海面，并且说：“美国所要采取的行动将在以后宣布。”美国宣传机器更大事渲染说英国运输机事件是“最严重的一次远东事件”，美国的反动议员也叫嚷说美国
  “不应袖手旁观”。事实证明，美国的好战分子力图以英国运输机事件为借口来向我国公开寻衅，扩大其在中国南部沿海的军事活动。
    但是美国政府采取这种侵略和挑衅行动所找寻的任何借口，是极其可鄙的。英国运输机的意外不幸事件，正由中国和英国之间循着外交途径合理解决，不容许美国乘机插手，蓄意造成严重的武装冲突。英国外交大臣艾登已经对我国政府处理英机事件的合理态度表示欢迎。英国“曼彻斯特卫报”二十七日发表的社论，就认为美国乘机干涉是“挑衅行为”，并对此表示不安。人们都不难看出，美国的无理行动证明了它是如何急于要对中华人民共和国扩大侵略，制造紧张局势，并从而挑拨正在改进中的中英关系。这是美国好战分子对国际正常关系和各国安全与和平的极端狂妄的举动。
    美国宣传机器在一片歇斯底里的叫嚣中，不能掩饰它们有意歪曲事实借端寻衅的阴谋目的。合众社伦敦二十五日电承认英机事件是一次“误会”；但这个通讯社的同日华盛顿电在报道杜勒斯的挑衅声明时说，华盛顿的“外交人士认为这个事件具有特别重要意义，因为它是紧跟着安排好印度支那停战的日内瓦会议之后发生的”，“预料美国将利用这一事件作为一种借口，以便努力使其他自由国家组织东南亚防务体系”。由此可见美国统治集团的侵略行动，竟到了何等疯狂地步了。
    中国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民及公正舆论，对于美国空军侵犯我国领空和以最野蛮的方式突然袭击并击落我国飞机两架、俯冲和扫射我国船舰的罪恶行动，都表示了谴责。中国人民完全拥护中央人民政府对美国政府的严重警告：美国政府应立即停止此类侵犯行动，否则，美国政府必须承担由其挑衅所引起的一切责任并将自食其果！
