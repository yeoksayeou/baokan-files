    The capital of Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Region in Yunnan Province, Cheli, has been renamed "Yunjinghong." "Yunjinghong" means "the capital of dawn" in the Dai language. Cheli is the name used by the Kuomintang reactionary rulers, following the practice of previous dynasties. The Dai people have always called it "Jinghong." The first session of the first People's Representative Conference of All Ethnic Groups and All Circles of the Autonomous Region made a resolution in accordance with the habits of local residents, adding the word "Yun" (Dai language: capital) to the original name "Jinghong," officially renaming Cheli as "Yunjinghong." Residents of the autonomous region are all satisfied with this name. Dai model worker Zha Wenzai said: "This name indicates that under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the Dai people and Xishuangbanna are like the sun just rising."

    西双版纳傣族自治区首府车里改称允景洪
    云南省西双版纳傣族自治区首府车里改称为
  “允景洪”。“允景洪”是傣语“黎明的首府”的意思。车里是国民党反动统治者袭用历代王朝所定用的名称，傣族人民一向称它为“景洪”。自治区第一届第二次各族各界人民代表会议按照当地居民的习惯作出决议，在原有的名称“景洪”的上面加上“允”（傣语：首府）字，把车里正式改称“允景洪”。自治区居民对这个名称都感到满意。傣族劳动模范鮓温宰说：“这个名称表示傣族人民和西双版纳地方在共产党、毛主席的领导下，像太阳刚刚升起来一样。”　（新华社）
