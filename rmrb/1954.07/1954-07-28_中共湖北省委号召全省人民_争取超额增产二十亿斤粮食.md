The Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently issued a resolution on striving to exceed the target of increasing grain production by 2 billion jin. This resolution was made by the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party based on a report from the Rural Work Department regarding agricultural production increases. The report from the Rural Work Department pointed out that the "Emergency Instructions on Mobilizing, Seizing the Opportunity, and Doing a Good Job in Current Agricultural Production" and the "Reiterated Instructions on Implementing the Movement for Increased Production and a Bumper Harvest in Non-Disaster Areas," issued not long ago by the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Hubei Provincial People's Government, have had a significant impact on the broad masses of peasants in the province. Judging from the current increased production plans of most counties, districts, and key townships, as well as the enthusiastic response of the broad masses of peasants, the potential for agricultural production increase is great, and there are many methods. The preliminary plans formulated by most regions greatly exceed the requirement of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Hubei Provincial People's Government for non-disaster areas to increase production by another 2.5 percent on the basis of the original increased production plans. At the same time, based on past experience, it is possible for non-disaster areas to exceed the increased production plans. Therefore, the report proposed a plan for non-disaster areas to increase grain production by another 1.261 billion jin and cotton by 26 million jin on the basis of the original 1954 increased production plan, and for disaster areas to produce 787 million jin of grain. The Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party approved this plan, which has been included in the resolution of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.

The resolution pointed out that in order to overcome floods, support national industrialization, and support the people in disaster areas, exceeding the target of increasing grain production by 2 billion jin has special and significant political and economic significance. This is an urgent combat task and a highly concentrated expression of the party and the people's tenacious fighting will. Party organizations, all Communist Party members, and all cadres throughout the province should enthusiastically respond to the call of the Party, first of all, act with a hundredfold intensity, carry forward the revolutionary fighting style, deeply lead the masses, and resolutely struggle to ensure the completion of this new agricultural production increase plan. Under these circumstances, any hesitation, wavering, lack of confidence, or bureaucratic attitude towards increased production is a manifestation of irresponsibility to the people, lack of fighting spirit, and weak Party spirit, and is extremely wrong.

After analyzing the favorable conditions and difficulties for achieving the increased production target, the resolution pointed out that the existing difficulties can be overcome. To ensure the victorious completion of the increased production task, the resolution stated: First, the leading party organs at all levels must repeatedly educate all cadres to deeply understand the special and significant political and economic significance of exceeding the target of increasing grain production by 2 billion jin, unify their thinking, unify their actions, and strive to exceed the target. At the same time, they must call on cadres to display a high degree of revolutionary spirit, go deep among the masses, go deep into the production process, overcome all difficulties, maintain their fighting enthusiasm from beginning to end, and carry out the increased production movement to the very end. Second, we must rely on the socialist and patriotic enthusiasm of millions of people and their initiative in increasing production through labor, and rapidly launch an unprecedentedly widespread and in-depth patriotic increased production movement. On the one hand, we should vigorously and widely mobilize and call on the people, and on the other hand, we should carry out in-depth ideological mobilization, closely combining the requirements of supporting industrialization, supporting disaster areas, and increasing production and improving the lives of the masses themselves, and create a warm atmosphere of patriotic increased production. To this end, we must give full play to the leading role of various advanced organizations (especially mutual aid and cooperation organizations) and advanced individuals, make full use of the method of combining key points with overall coverage, rapidly and widely convene various representative meetings, summarize and exchange local experiences in increased production, calculate and compare accounts, tap potential, universally revise increased production plans, and carry out patriotic increased production competitions, to ensure that rapid and universal action is taken within half a month. Third, we must seize the main links of current increased production and ensure the completion of the increased production task. All regions should universally promote the cultivation of seedlings of sun (i.e., cultivating regenerated rice) to harvest an additional crop; expand the planting area of late autumn crops through various intercropping methods and the use of all vacant land; and strengthen the processing and cultivation of existing crops and field management. Waterlogged areas should actively drain and replant in the spirit of "competing with floods for land" and "competing with floods for grain"; areas affected by mountain floods should actively restore production by taking measures such as protecting seedlings, supporting seedlings, washing seedlings, replanting, and changing crops, and strive to harvest an additional crop. The above-mentioned main potential for increased production and various methods of increasing production should be combined with preventing waste and promoting economy, so that every household and every person can find specific ways to increase production and save. All regions should put forward specific increased production plans for different regions, and instruct agricultural technical guidance departments to strengthen technical guidance. Fourth, seize the time and do a good job in various preparations. All regions should pay attention to preventing autumn droughts, rapidly restore damaged dams and ponds, and step up water storage and conservation; vigorously carry out summer fertilizer accumulation movements to prepare sufficient fertilizer for multiple planting and harvesting; in addition to mobilizing farmers to raise various seeds locally, grain and cooperative departments should purchase and supply a large number of various seeds according to needs; with the change of some planting habits, pay attention to organizing the supply of needed agricultural tools; and organize the issuance of agricultural loans in a timely and effective manner. Fifth, the entire Party must be mobilized, secretaries must take action, and concrete leadership must be effectively strengthened. Able cadres should be dispatched to go deep into mutual aid and cooperation organizations, deep among the masses, and deep into the fields, and implement inspection and supervision at each level. They must closely grasp the situation of the movement, promptly commend and criticize, promptly introduce successful experiences, and promptly help correct mistakes, set an example, and oppose stopping at general calls and being satisfied with the general arrangements and plans of the leading organs.

The resolution concluded by pointing out that the key to the decision to exceed the target of increasing grain production by 2 billion jin lies in strengthening leadership. Party committees at all levels must have a firm determination and confidence, closely rely on rural backbone elements and mutual aid and cooperation organizations, carry forward the revolutionary fighting style, seize the opportunity, redouble their efforts, and rapidly launch an agricultural production increase movement on an unprecedented scale.

    中共湖北省委号召全省人民
    争取超额增产二十亿斤粮食
    中共湖北省委员会最近下达关于为超额完成增产二十亿斤粮食而斗争的决议。这个决议是中共湖北省委员会根据农村工作部关于农业增产问题的报告而作出的。农村工作部的报告指明：不久以前中共湖北省委员会、湖北省人民政府发出的“关于动员起来，抓紧时机，做好当前农业生产的紧急指示”和“关于贯彻非灾区开展增产丰收运动的指示的再次指示”，已在全省广大农民群众中发生了很大的影响。从目前大部分县、区和重点乡的增产计划以及广大农民群众响应号召的热烈情绪来看，农业增产的潜力很大，办法很多。大部分地区初步制订的计划，都大大超过了中共湖北省委员会、湖北省人民政府对非灾区在原有增产计划基础上再增产百分之二点五的要求。同时根据历年经验来看，非灾区超额完成增产计划是可能的。因此报告中提出了非灾区在一九五四年原订增产计划的基础上再增产粮食十二亿六千一百万斤和皮棉二千六百万斤，灾区生产粮食七亿八千七百万斤的计划。中共湖北省委员会批准了这个计划。这个计划已列入中共湖北省委员会的决议。
    决议指出：为了战胜洪水，支援国家工业化，支援灾区人民，超额完成二十亿斤粮食的增产任务具有特殊的严重的政治意义和经济意义。这是一个紧急的战斗任务，也是党和人民顽强的战斗意志高度集中的表现。全省党的组织、全体共产党员和全体干部应热烈响应党的号召，首先百倍紧张地行动起来，发扬革命战斗作风，深入领导群众，为保证完成这一新的农业增产计划而坚决奋斗。在此情况下，任何迟疑、动摇、缺乏信心和对增产采取官僚主义态度，都是对人民不负责、缺乏斗志和党性不强的表现，都是极端错误的。
    决议在分析超额增产的有利条件和困难后，指出现存的困难是可以克服的。为了保证增产任务的胜利完成，决议中说：首先，各级党的领导机关要反复教育全体干部，使之深刻认识超额增产二十亿斤粮食的特殊严重的政治意义和经济意义，统一思想，统一行动，力争超额完成任务；同时要号召干部发挥高度的革命精神，深入群众，深入生产过程，克服一切困难，自始至终保持战斗热情，把增产运动一直贯彻到底。第二，必须依靠千百万群众的社会主义、爱国主义的热情和劳动增产的积极性，迅速展开空前广泛深入的爱国增产运动。一方面大张旗鼓地广泛进行动员号召，一方面进行深入的思想发动，把支援工业化、支援灾区和群众本身增加生产、改善生活的要求紧密结合起来，普遍造成爱国增产的热烈空气。为此，必须充分发挥各种先进组织（特别是互助合作组织）和先进人物的带头作用，充分运用点面结合的办法，迅速广泛地召开各种代表会，总结交流当地增产经验，算账对比，挖潜力，普遍修订增产计划，开展爱国增产竞赛，保证在半月内迅速普遍行动起来。第三，必须抓紧当前增产的主要环节，保证完成增产任务。各地应普遍推广蓄秧荪（即培植再生稻），多收一季；通过各种间作及利用一切空地的办法，扩大晚秋作物的播种面积；加强现有作物的加工培育、田间管理。渍水地区应本“与洪水争地”“与洪水争粮”的精神，积极进行排水抢种；山洪成灾地区应采取保苗、扶苗、洗苗、补种、改种等办法，积极恢复生产，力争多收一季。以上这些增产的主要潜力与各种增产办法，要和防止浪费、提倡节约结合起来，使每户每人都能找到增产节约的具体门路。各地应针对不同地区提出具体的增产计划，并责成农业技术指导部门加强技术指导。第四，抓紧时间，做好各种准备工作。各地应注意预防秋旱，迅速恢复被毁的水坝、塘堰，加紧蓄水、保水；大力开展夏季积肥运动，为多种多收一季准备充足肥料；除发动农民就地筹措各种种籽外，粮食、合作等部门应根据需要，大量采办和供应各种种籽；随着若干种植习惯的改变，注意组织所需农具的供应；适时有效地组织农业贷款的发放。第五，必须全党动员，书记动手，切实加强具体领导，抽派得力干部，深入互助合作组织，深入群众，深入田间，逐级实行检查督促，密切掌握运动情况，及时表扬批评，及时介绍成功经验，及时帮助纠正错误，做出样子，反对停止于一般号召，和满足于领导机关的一般布置和一般计划。
    决议最后指出：超额完成增产二十亿斤粮食的任务的决定关键在于加强领导。各级党委必须具有坚强的决心与信心，紧紧依靠乡村骨干和互助合作组织，发扬革命的战斗作风，抓紧时机，加倍努力，迅速开展一个空前规模的农业增产运动。
