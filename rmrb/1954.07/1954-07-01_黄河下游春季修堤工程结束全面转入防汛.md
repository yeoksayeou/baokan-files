    Downstream Yellow River Spring Dyke Repair Project Completed, Fully Transitioning to Flood Control
    The downstream Yellow River spring dyke repair project has been completed and has now fully transitioned to flood control. This year, the downstream Yellow River dyke repair involved over 9.6 million cubic meters of earthwork. After mobilizing more than 110,000 people starting in March, all work has now been completed. Before going to the dykes, the dyke repair workers made arrangements for production and strengthened the mutual aid and cooperation movement. After arriving at the dykes, a labor competition was launched along the entire line, resulting in a general increase in quality and efficiency. In Shandong, the average efficiency reached 5 cubic meters, an increase of more than 15% compared to last year. In Henan, the average efficiency was over 4 cubic meters, an increase of more than 10% compared to last year. Both provinces also made significant improvements in quality. The hazard repair project involved more than 170,000 cubic meters of stonework. The engineering teams in both provinces mostly implemented assembly-line operations, improved operating techniques, and generally improved quality. Cone penetration exploration also discovered and eliminated a large number of hidden dangers. In addition, the work of planting grass and willows is also nearing completion.
    After the completion of the dyke repair project, the Yellow River Flood Control Headquarters of both provinces resumed operations in early June. Currently, many counties have held flood control meetings. Flood control houses have been renovated along the river, and the telephone lines along the Yellow River have been strengthened and repaired, focusing on key areas. Materials for emergency repairs have been stockpiled at all dangerous dyke sections. More than 140 flood reporting hydrological, water level, and rainfall stations, as well as long-term flood control personnel and engineering teams along the river, are also prepared. Reporting of flood conditions and going on dyke duty will begin on July 1st to prepare for the Yellow River's major flood. (Xu Sijing)

    黄河下游春季修堤工程结束全面转入防汛
    黄河下游春季修堤工程结束，现已全面转入防汛。今年黄河下游修堤计土方工程九百六十余万立方公尺，经动员群众十一万余人自三月份先后开工，现已全部竣工。修堤民工上堤前都将生产作了安排，加强了互助合作运动；上堤后全线展开了劳动竞赛，因而质量效率普遍提高。山东平均效率达到五公方，比去年提高百分之十五强，河南平均效率四公方以上，比去年提高百分之十强。在质量方面两省也都有显著提高。整险工程计石工十七万多公方，两省工程队大都贯彻了流水作业，改进了操作技术，普遍提高了质量。锥探工程也发现和消灭了大量隐患。此外植草植柳工作也已接近竣工。
    修堤工程结束后，两省黄河防汛指挥部已于六月初恢复办公，目前不少县已开了防汛会议，沿河现已整修了防汛屋，并重点增架、整修了黄河沿岸的电话线路，各险工堤段都储备了抢险用的料物，一百四十余个报汛水文、水位、雨量站及沿河长期防汛员、工程队也都作好了准备，七月一日即开始报汛、上堤，以迎接黄河大汛。（徐思敬）
