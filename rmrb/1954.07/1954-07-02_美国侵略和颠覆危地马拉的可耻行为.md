    The Shameful U.S. Aggression and Subversion of Guatemala
    Tan Wenrui
    While organizing and directly commanding the armed aggression against Guatemala from abroad, the U.S. ruling clique also successively instigated two armed coups within Guatemala, overthrowing the legitimate Arbenz government. The U.S. planners first used the Díaz military group as an intermediary to usurp power; then they used another military group headed by Monzón to complete the subversion plan. After the Monzón group, the betrayers of the Guatemalan people, came to power, they immediately destroyed the democratic system that Guatemala had established over many years, adopted brutal fascist measures, massively persecuted progressives, confiscated the weapons of the masses resisting the invaders, and surrendered to the armed invaders.
    It has been fully proven that both coups were orchestrated by U.S. interventionists. The Honduran ambassador to Washington (Honduras being the main accomplice of the U.S. in its aggression against Guatemala), Heliodoro, publicly revealed this "internal and external coordination" subversion plan arranged by the U.S. after the armed invasion of Guatemala began. He said: If the invaders could not achieve the goal of seizing Guatemala within a week, "the Guatemalan army will implement a coup."
    Even U.S. newspapers and news agencies made no secret of this. "Chicago Daily News" reporter Laher reported that U.S. Ambassador to Guatemala, Peurifoy, was the real protagonist in this incident. Associated Press reporter Somellin also reported the process of Peurifoy "holding talks" with Guatemalan subversives. "The New York Times" dispatch also bluntly stated that this was "a series of actions in which U.S. Ambassador Peurifoy played a major role." Therefore, the U.S. attempt to portray the recent events in Guatemala as a struggle for power between Guatemalan military groups is obviously deceptive.
    It is particularly noteworthy that responsible U.S. government officials could not help but express their joy at the "success" of orchestrating the coup in Guatemala. U.S. President Eisenhower and Secretary of State Dulles both publicly expressed "comfort," "satisfaction," and "welcome" on June 30. Dulles even shamelessly called the subversion activities they had orchestrated a "new and glorious" victory. This is like a murderer showing off the bloodstains on his hands after committing a crime. The U.S. ruling clique has actually confessed to the people of the world that it is the culprit in strangling the democratic regime of Guatemala.
    As everyone knows, the U.S. monopoly capital United Fruit Company and its affiliated enterprises control Guatemala's economy and are the mainstays of reactionary forces in Guatemala. Many prominent figures in the U.S. government, such as U.S. Secretary of State Dulles and U.S. Representative to the United Nations Lodge, are related to this company. The Arbenz government of Guatemala had taken some democratic measures to safeguard national interests, and in the spring and August of 1953, confiscated about 240,000 acres of abandoned land of the United Fruit Company in Guatemala, but the United Fruit Company still occupied large tracts of land and vast banana plantations in Guatemala, and controlled Guatemala's only railway line and three major ports. At the same time, the Guatemalan Electric Company, belonging to U.S. and foreign electric power companies, almost completely monopolized the distribution of electricity in Guatemala. U.S. monopoly capital continues to extract excessive profits in Guatemala, continues to organize reactionary forces, engages in conspiracies that endanger Guatemala's national sovereignty, and interferes in Guatemala's internal affairs. Since 1944, the United States has instigated more than 30 subversion activities in Guatemala. Armas, the leader of the interventionist army that launched the armed aggression against Guatemala under the instigation of the United States this time, is the agent of the United Fruit Company. This clearly exposes the sinister faces of the agents of U.S. monopoly capital.
    The U.S.'s despicable act of subverting the democratic and independent government of Guatemala by such "internal and external coordination" exposes its colonial empire face in Latin America. As early as 1895, the U.S. State Department formally notified its competitor, the British government, that: "The United States today actually possesses sovereignty over this continent (America), and its orders are the law for subordinate countries within its scope." In modern times, the United States has always regarded itself as the overlord of Latin America. U.S. monopoly companies, such as the United Fruit Company, have become the center of financial exploitation in Latin America, controlling most of the agricultural production, almost all of the iron, manganese, and platinum production, nine-tenths of the copper, seven-tenths of the silver, two-thirds of the zinc, and more than half of the oil production. The reactionary forces supported and organized by U.S. monopoly companies unscrupulously interfere in the internal affairs of various countries, creating endless coups to eliminate any tendency toward independence and autonomy, and strengthen its enslavement of various countries. Under the interference and control of the United States, the political instability of Latin American countries can be illustrated by the example of Ecuador, which has changed twelve presidents in ten years. The frequency of coups in other countries is also like a revolving lantern.
    The democratic government of Guatemala was poisoned because it had not recognized the "sovereignty" of the United States in Guatemala for ten years and had not allowed the "laws" of the United States to be manipulated.
    However, the glorious struggle of the Guatemalan people against U.S. colonialist oppression cannot be erased by any force. The Guatemalan people have placed the United States before the world's court of justice and declared the shameful bankruptcy of the United States in politics and morality. The people of Latin America will be more awakened and believe that their just struggle for independence and freedom will eventually be victorious.

    美国侵略和颠覆危地马拉的可耻行为
    谭文瑞
    美国统治集团在组织和直接指挥从国外对危地马拉进行武装侵略的同时，并在危地马拉国内连续策动了两次武力政变，推翻了合法的阿本斯政府。美国策划者首先把迪亚斯军事集团作为居间人，篡夺了政权；然后利用另一以蒙松为首的军事集团来完成颠覆计划。危地马拉人民的背叛者蒙松集团上台后，便立即摧毁了危地马拉多年来建立的民主制度，采取了残暴的法西斯措施，大肆迫害进步人士，缴夺抵抗侵略者的群众的武器，向武装侵犯势力投降。
    事情完全证明，这两次政变都是美国干涉者所一手策动的。洪都拉斯（美国侵略危地马拉的主要帮手）驻华盛顿大使海洛多罗，在对危地马拉的武装侵犯行动开始以后，就曾公开地透露了美国所布置的这一套“内应外合”的颠覆计划。他说：如果入侵者不能在一星期之内达到夺取危地马拉的目的，“危地马拉军队将实行政变”。
    美国的报纸和通讯社甚至也毫不掩饰这一点。“芝加哥每日新闻”记者拉赫报道说：美国驻危地马拉大使普里弗伊是这次事件中的真正主角。美联社记者索麦林还报道了普里弗伊与危地马拉的颠覆分子“进行了交谈”的经过。“纽约时报”的电讯也直言不讳这是“美国大使普里弗伊在其中起很大作用的一连串行动”。因此，美国企图把危地马拉最近发生的事件说成是危地马拉军事集团之间争夺权力的斗争，显然是骗不了人的。
    特别值得注意的是，美国政府的负责官员对于在危地马拉策动政变的“成功”，禁不住他们的眉飞色舞。美国总统艾森豪威尔和国务卿杜勒斯在六月三十日都公开对此表示“欣慰”、“满意”和
  “欢迎”。杜勒斯甚至不知羞耻地把他们所一手策划的颠覆活动称作是一个“新的、光荣的”胜利。这就如同杀人犯行凶之后炫耀手上的血迹一样。美国统治集团实际上是向全世界人民供认了自己是绞杀危地马拉民主政权的罪魁。
    人所共知，美国垄断资本联合果品公司及其附属企业控制着危地马拉的经济，是危地马拉反动势力的主要支柱。美国政府中的许多显要人物如美国国务卿杜勒斯及美国驻联合国代表洛奇等人都与这个公司有关系。危地马拉的阿本斯政府曾采取了一些维护民族利益的民主措施，于一九五三年春天及同年八月没收了联合果品公司在危地马拉的约二十四万英亩的荒废土地，但是联合果品公司依然在危地马拉占有大片的土地和面积广大的香蕉种植园，并且控制着危地马拉的唯一的铁路线和三个主要港口。同时，属于美国及外国电力公司的危地马拉电气公司几乎完全垄断了危地马拉的电力分配。美国垄断资本在危地马拉仍然继续榨取超额的利润，继续组织反动势力，进行危害危地马拉国家主权的阴谋，干涉危地马拉内政。自一九四四年以来，美国在危地马拉策动过三十多次的颠覆活动。这次在美国策动下对危地马拉发动武装侵略的干涉军的领袖阿马斯，就是联合果品公司的代理人。这就清楚地暴露了美国垄断资本的代理人们的凶恶面目。
    美国用这种“内应外合”的卑劣手段颠覆危地马拉民主独立政府的行为，暴露了它在拉丁美洲的殖民帝国的面目。早在一八九五年，美国国务院就曾正式照会它的竞争者英国政府说：“美国今天实际上拥有这个大陆（美洲）的主权，它的命令对于在它范围内的臣属国就是法律”。近代以来，美国一直把自己看作拉丁美洲的太上皇。美国的垄断公司，如联合果品公司之类，成了拉丁美洲的财政剥削的中心，控制了拉丁美洲大部分的农业生产，几乎全部的铁、锰、铂的生产，十分之九的铜，十分之七的银，三分之二的锌，和一半以上的石油生产。美国垄断公司所支持和组织的反动势力，肆无忌惮地干涉各国内政，制造无休止的政变，来扫除任何独立自主的倾向，加强它对各国的奴役统治。在美国的干涉和控制下，拉丁美洲国家政治上不安定的情况，可以厄瓜多尔为例来说明，厄瓜多尔曾在十年中换了十二个总统。其他各国政变的频繁，也是像走马灯一样。
    危地马拉民主政府就是因为十年来没有承认美国在危地马拉的“主权”，没有听任美国的“法律”摆布，而遭到了毒手。
    但是，危地马拉人民反抗美国殖民主义压迫的光荣斗争，是任何势力所抹不掉的。危地马拉人民把美国置于世界正义的法庭面前，并宣判了美国在政治上道义上的可耻破产。拉丁美洲人民将更加觉醒，相信他们争取独立自由的正义斗争是终会得到胜利的。
