    Soviet Council of Ministers Issues a Decision
    To Implement Coeducational Teaching System Starting Next Academic Year
      [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 26th] TASS, Moscow reports: The Soviet Council of Ministers, considering the requests of students' parents and the opinions of school teachers, recently decided to implement a coeducational teaching system in Moscow, Leningrad, and other cities starting from the 1954-1955 academic year. At the beginning of this academic year, students from the first to ninth grades in both boys' and girls' schools will be merged. To allow tenth-grade students to complete their studies with their original teachers, the tenth-grade students will not be merged for the time being. Student transfers and class assignments are scheduled to be completed by July 25th.
    R.S.F.S.R. Minister of Education, Kairov, published an article in "Pravda" on the 20th, discussing the significance of this decision by the Soviet Council of Ministers. He pointed out that the separate education system for boys and girls in schools in Moscow, Leningrad, and other cities was implemented in the 1943-1944 academic year. This system was only implemented in a small number of schools. The results of studying the experience of implementing separate education for boys and girls proved that it did not improve school education work. Practice has shown that it is not necessary to make some fundamental distinctions in arranging physical exercises for boys and girls. Some sports courses only need to change the form for different objects. As for the issue of training students to engage in labor and practical work, from the perspective of the current requirements for universal education, solving this problem does not require separating boys and girls, nor is it necessary to stipulate certain labor education characteristics in boys' and girls' schools. According to the instructions of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, all schools should implement comprehensive technical education and train students to engage in practical work. Therefore, the paths and methods for completing these tasks should be common to students in both boys' and girls' schools. In addition, the separate education system for boys and girls has caused difficulties in the implementation of universal education, the allocation of schools, and the distribution of student quotas in various schools.
    Kairov said that practice has proven that under the coeducational teaching system, the life of student collectives is more creative and interesting, and the work of the Young Pioneers and extracurricular activities are more multifaceted and richer in content. Under the coeducational teaching system, a sincere comradeship is gradually established between boys and girls. However, under the separate education system for boys and girls, boys and girls have little contact, and only contact outside of school, so it is difficult to form a comradeship.

    苏联部长会议发布决定
    下学年起开始实行男女合校教学制
      【新华社二十六日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联部长会议考虑到了学生家长的要求和学校教师的意见，最近决定从一九五四—一九五五学年起在莫斯科、列宁格勒和其他城市中实行男女合校教学制。这一学年开始时，男女学校中从一年级到九年级的学生一律合并在一起。为了使十年级的学生能由原来的教师一直教完他们的学业，十年级的学生暂不合并。学生转学和编班工作规定在七月二十五日以前全部结束。
    俄罗斯联邦教育部部长凯罗夫二十日在“真理报”上撰文，论述苏联部长会议这一决定的意义。他指出：莫斯科、列宁格勒和其他城市的学校中男女分校教学制是在一九四三—一九四四学年开始实行的。这种制度只在少数的学校中实行。研究实行男女分校教学制经验的结果证明，它并没有改善学校教育工作。实践表明，在布置男生和女生的体力锻炼方面没有必要加以某些根本的区分。某些体育课程只须对不同的对象改变一下形式就行了。至于说到训练学生从事劳动和实际工作的问题，就现在对普及学校的要求来看，解决这个问题并不需要把男生和女生分开，也不必在男子学校和女子学校中规定某些劳动教育的特点。根据苏联共产党第十九次代表大会的指示，所有的学校都要实行综合技术教育和训练学生从事实际工作。所以，不论是对男子学校或女子学校的学生来说，完成这些任务的途径和方法都应当是共同的。此外，男女分校教学制对普及教育的实施、学校的配置和各校学生名额的分配都感到困难。
    凯罗夫说，实践证明，在男女合校教学制的条件下，学生集体的生活过得更加有创造性，更加有趣，少先队的工作和课外工作也更为多方面，内容也更加丰富，在男女合校教学制下，男生和女生之间逐渐建立起真挚的同志关系。而在男女分校教学制的条件下，男生和女生很少接触，而且仅仅是在校外接触，因此同志关系就很难形成。
