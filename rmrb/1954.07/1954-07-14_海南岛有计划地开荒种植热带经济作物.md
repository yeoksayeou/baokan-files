Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, July 13th: On the more than 1.5 million mu of wasteland from Lingshui to Chengmai via Changgan on Hainan Island, Guangdong Province, four state-owned farms mainly planting tropical economic crops have now been established. Before the summer cultivation, the state-owned Red October, Red Island, and Sanmenpo mechanical farms had planted more than 5,200 mu of sisal hemp (which can be made into ropes for industrial, mining, fishing, and marine industries), bananas, derris, coffee, pineapple and other crops. It is estimated that the area of these crops will be more than doubled before the autumn cultivation. In addition to producing sisal hemp and bananas, the state-owned Xinglong Overseas Chinese Collective Farm is now beginning to plant oil palm (an oil crop with a very high oil content) and pepper. In addition, the state-owned Diaoluo Mountain Forest Farm has successfully cultivated cinchona trees (the raw material for a special medicine for treating malaria) and plans to promote it next year. The state-owned Yaxian and Changgan Forest Gardens are also starting to cultivate castor beans and Java cotton.

There are at least 10 million mu of arable wasteland on Hainan Island. In addition to being used to grow food crops, the soil and climate of many wastelands are suitable for planting tropical economic crops that are needed by the country's industry and are unique to the local area. Last year, the island provided the country with about 40 kinds of economically valuable agricultural products such as coconuts and sisal hemp, with a total output value of 240 billion yuan. In order to adapt to the development of the country's socialist industrialization, the agricultural and forestry leadership institutions on Hainan Island have been expanded this year, and work teams have been organized to investigate and study valuable tropical economic crops. The state has established and will continue to establish large-scale state-owned mechanical farms on Hainan Island to reclaim wasteland and plant these tropical economic crops in a planned manner. At the same time, the local people's government will adopt the method of entrusting seedling cultivation and self-planting and self-harvesting to mobilize farmers to use scattered small plots of land for planting.

    海南岛有计划地开荒种植热带经济作物
   【新华社广州十三日电】广东省海南岛自陵水经昌感到澄迈的一百五十多万亩荒地上，目前已建立四个以种植热带经济作物为主的国营农场。国营红十月、红岛、三门坡三个机械农场夏耕前已种植剑麻（可制成绳缆，供工矿、渔业、航海业用）、香蕉、鱼藤、咖啡、菠萝等五千二百多亩，预计到秋耕前这几种作物的面积将比现在扩大一倍多。国营兴隆华侨集体农场除已出产剑麻、香蕉等外，现正开始种植油棕（一种含油量很丰富的油料作物）和胡椒。此外国营吊罗山林场培育金鸡纳树（治疟疾特效药的原料）已经成功，计划在明年推广。国营崖县、昌感两个林园也着手培育蓖麻和爪哇棉。
    海南岛可耕的荒地至少有一千万亩，除用来种植粮食作物外，很多荒地的土壤、气候适合种植国家工业所需而又为当地所特产的热带经济作物。去年这个岛为国家提供了椰子、剑麻等约四十种富有经济价值的农产品，生产总值达二千四百亿元。为适应国家的社会主义工业化的发展，今年海南岛的农林领导机构已经扩大，并组织了工作队，调查研究有价值的热带经济作物。国家在海南岛已经建立和将要继续建立大规模的国营机械农场，有计划地开荒种植这些热带经济作物。同时，当地人民政府将采取委托育苗、自种自收的方式，发动农民利用零星小块土地来种植。
