    The First Session of the First People's Congress of Ruijin County, Jiangxi Province, was held from June 21st to 26th in Ruijin County, Jiangxi Province, the site of the Central Workers' and Peasants' Democratic Government during the Second Revolutionary Civil War. The meeting enthusiastically discussed the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China, and unanimously adopted the resolution to support the Draft Constitution and a letter of salute to Chairman Mao.

    A total of one hundred and ninety representatives attended the meeting, many of whom were former staff members of the Workers' and Peasants' Democratic Government and veteran soldiers of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, as well as many family members of revolutionary martyrs and family members of revolutionary soldiers. During the discussion of the Draft Constitution, they recalled their experiences in the struggle for the people's democratic rights under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and deeply felt that this Draft Constitution was the result of the long-term revolutionary struggle of the Chinese people. Liang Zaisui, a former staff member of the Workers' and Peasants' Democratic Government and a people's representative, said: Now the Draft Constitution has been promulgated. This Draft Constitution explicitly stipulates the freedom, democracy, and happy life that the people of Ruijin and the people of the whole country have been striving for for decades, and points out the bright road towards a better socialist society. This Draft Constitution fully expresses the wishes of the people of Ruijin. Liang Zaisui promised that after returning, he would explain the specific content of the Draft Constitution and the close relationship between the Draft Constitution and every farmer to the voters item by item, and take the lead in running the year-round mutual aid team in his township well, striving to transform it into an agricultural production cooperative after the autumn harvest. Yang Cairong, a former female staff member of the Workers' and Peasants' Democratic Government and a people's representative, said: In the past, women were not even as good as cattle and horses. During the Second Revolutionary Civil War, women in Ruijin County enjoyed democratic rights under the leadership of Chairman Mao. After the Red Army went north to resist Japan in 1934, our women's rights were completely deprived by the Kuomintang. Only after liberation did we regain these rights. Now, the state has written all kinds of rights enjoyed by women into the Draft Constitution, so that the status of women will be guaranteed by state law.

    After discussing the Draft Constitution, the meeting unanimously adopted the resolution to support the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China and a letter of salute to Chairman Mao. The resolution stated: All representatives should conscientiously participate in the discussion of the Draft Constitution, and lead the people of the county to carry out mass discussions to ensure that everyone knows about it; all representatives must actively participate in mutual aid and cooperation organizations, and play a leading role in mutual aid and cooperation organizations, strive to establish one hundred agricultural production cooperatives after the autumn harvest, and strive to complete and over fulfill the plan to increase grain production by 7% this year.

    江西省瑞金县第一届第一次人民代表大会会议
    热烈讨论中华人民共和国宪法草案
    第二次国内革命战争时期的中央工农民主政府所在地——江西省瑞金县在六月二十一日到二十六日举行了第一届第一次人民代表大会会议。会议热烈地讨论了中华人民共和国宪法草案，并一致通过了拥护宪法草案的决议和向毛主席致敬的电文。
    出席会议的代表共一百九十人，其中有许多人是前工农民主政府的工作人员和中国工农红军的老战士，还有许多革命烈士家属和革命军人家属。他们在讨论宪法草案时，回忆了自己在中国共产党和毛主席领导下争取人民民主权利的斗争的经历，深切地感到这个宪法草案是我国人民长期革命斗争的成果。前工农民主政府的工作人员、人民代表梁在燧说：现在宪法草案公布了。这个宪法草案把我们瑞金人民和全国人民奋斗几十年所追求的自由、民主和幸福美好的生活都明文规定下来，并且指出了走向更美好的社会主义社会的光明大道，这个宪法草案完全表达了我们瑞金人民的心意。梁在燧保证回去后一定要向选民逐条讲解宪法草案的具体内容和宪法草案同每一个农民的切身关系，并且带头办好他那个乡的常年互助组，争取秋后转为农业生产合作社。前工农民主政府的妇女工作人员、人民代表杨彩容说：过去我们妇女连牛马都不如，第二次国内革命战争时期，我们瑞金县的妇女在毛主席领导下，曾经得到过民主权利。一九三四年红军北上抗日后，我们妇女的权利被国民党剥夺光了，解放后，我们才又重新得到了这些权利。现在，国家又把妇女享有的各种权利都写在宪法草案上，这样妇女的地位就将得到国家法律的保障了。
    会议在讨论宪法草案后，一致通过了拥护中华人民共和国宪法草案的决议和向毛主席的致敬电。决议中表示：全体代表要认真参加宪法草案的讨论，并要带领全县人民开展群众性的讨论，保证做到家喻户晓，人人皆知；全体代表一定要积极参加互助合作组织，并在互助合作组织中起带头作用，为秋后建立一百个农业生产合作社而努力，并争取完成和超额完成今年增产粮食百分之七的计划。
