    Activities of Discussing the Draft Constitution Gradually Unfold in Cities like Beijing, Chongqing, Chengdu, Guiyang, Kunming, and Ya'an

    (Xinhua News Agency dispatch) People from all walks of life in cities such as Beijing, Chongqing, Chengdu, Guiyang, Kunming, and Ya'an have gradually launched various activities to publicize and discuss the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China.

    In Beijing, since the day the Draft Constitution was published, nearly 100,000 cadres from various government agencies, organizations, factories, enterprises, and schools have begun planned discussion activities. Leaders and reporters of each unit have made reports to the broad masses of cadres. Cadres participating in the discussion are now earnestly reading the documents and beginning a systematic discussion of the full text of the Draft Constitution. In addition to reading and discussing during the prescribed time, many government cadres have also engaged in informal talks. Most of the workers in major factories, enterprises, and construction sites have heard the first lecture on the Draft Constitution, and a few units have already begun the second lecture and are now entering the discussion phase. Universities such as Peking University have established Draft Constitution Discussion Committees and formulated discussion plans. The China People's University and the Beijing Institute of Geology plan to concentrate a few days starting from July 1 to discuss the Draft Constitution. Shu Sheyu, director of the literary and art circles branch of the Beijing Draft Constitution Discussion Committee, gave a mobilization report to the opera and traditional Chinese painting circles on June 24, and they are now conducting discussions and symposiums separately. Discussions on the Draft Constitution have also begun among some members of the industrial and commercial circles in the capital; discussion activities among the Beijing organizations of various democratic parties and ethnic minorities and religious circles are about to begin systematically. In various urban and suburban districts of the city, trained reporters have begun to explain the Draft Constitution to workers, peasants, and citizens. Big-character posters, blackboards, radio stations, and reading groups on streets, factories, construction sites, and schools are all centered on publicizing and discussing the Draft Constitution. In order to further deepen publicity and discussion, the districts in the city have successively begun training more than 20,000 propagandists, grassroots trade union cadres, study tutors, and some street activists from June 23, so as to conduct in-depth publicity and explanation to the masses when the discussion is universally launched throughout the city.

    In Chongqing, hundreds of reporters have successively gone to factories, rural areas, schools, government agencies, and streets to give reports. A large number of propagandists have also successively gone deep into the masses to begin publicity. Cao Diqiu, First Secretary of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, gave a report to thousands of workers at the 101 Iron and Steel Plant. Report meetings have been held in more than ten large factories such as the Chongqing Power Plant and the 610 Textile Factory. Many small and medium-sized factories, streets, government agencies, and schools have also held report meetings. Report meetings on the Draft Constitution are being held successively by local organizations of various democratic parties, cultural and health departments, industrial and commercial circles, and religious circles. In the rural areas of the suburbs, the activities of publicizing the Draft Constitution are being carried out with emphasis in conjunction with the current central work.

    In Chengdu, more than 300 reporters and more than 1,800 propagandists have been dispatched to give reports to people from all walks of life and assist everyone in carrying out discussions. More than 30,000 cadres from provincial and municipal government agencies have generally held four to five discussions.

    In Guiyang, the training of reporters has ended. Zhou Lin, Vice Chairman of the Guizhou Provincial People's Government, gave a report to more than 1,100 leading cadres of provincial and municipal government agencies and representatives of people from all walks of life. Workers from various factories and mines, ethnic minorities, people from industrial and commercial circles, and people from religious circles in Guiyang have held symposiums one after another. More than 150 cadres and peasants from 15 ethnic groups including the Miao, Bouyei, and Zhuang participated in a symposium held by the Ethnic Affairs Commission of the Guizhou Provincial People's Government.

    In Kunming, a propaganda team of 10,000 people, including returned overseas Chinese and cadres of various ethnic minorities, has been trained. This propaganda army has launched publicity activities among more than 600,000 citizens in the city. More than 20,000 government cadres, workers, peasants, students, etc., have held symposiums and discussions.

    In Ya'an, the 112 reporters and propagandists trained by the Draft Constitution Discussion Committee of Ya'an City have gone to various factories, residential areas, and rural areas in the suburbs to conduct publicity since the 21st. By the 25th, the first report had been given to people from all walks of life.
