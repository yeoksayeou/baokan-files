Xinhua News Agency:

    The population of the Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Region in Guangdong Province is thriving. In the five counties of Baoting, Baisha, Dongfang, Qiongzhong, and Ledong, more than 42,800 children have been born since liberation, accounting for 15.2 percent of the total population of the five counties. In Baoting County, where infant mortality was severe in the past, one can now often see groups of dark, sturdy children playing under the setting sun in coconut groves. New houses have been built at the foot of the mountains, and many families have "Bu Ai" (hammocks) or rattan baskets hanging on their doors, with infants sleeping soundly inside. There are forty Miao households in Yafang Village, Qiongzhong County. Before liberation, there were fewer than ten children; now there are more than thirty. The village lacked grain in the year before last and last year, but this year's early rice is already enough to eat. In the past, under the Kuomintang reactionaries' cruel rule and oppression, the Li and Miao people lived in extreme poverty. Most of them had only half a year's worth of grain, no quilts in winter, and no mosquito nets in summer, not to mention medical care and sanitation. Since liberation, in order to help the Li and Miao people develop production and improve their lives, the People's Government has continuously allocated huge sums to build water conservancy projects, provide relief to the poor, and distribute free farm tools, resulting in increased grain production. This year, the Li and Miao people have basically eliminated grain shortages. The People's Government has also established thirty-seven medical institutions in the autonomous region, providing free medical treatment and various vaccinations to people of all ethnic groups, eradicating the once prevalent smallpox, and greatly reducing diseases such as pneumonia, malignant malaria, and dysentery. As the lives of the Li and Miao people have improved, the population has increased year by year.

    The People's Government of the Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Region in Guangdong Province recently established five farm tool factories in the five counties of Ledong, Baoting, Baisha, Qiongzhong, and Dongfang, where the Li and Miao people live in concentrated communities. In the past, the Li and Miao farmers of the Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Region used backward farm tools such as wooden plows and wooden harrows, resulting in extremely low production efficiency. After liberation, the People's Government transported a large number of iron farm tools from the Han areas to help them develop production, but due to inconvenient transportation or the incompatibility of farm tool types with local usage habits, the needs of the Li and Miao people could still not be met. In order to further help the people of all ethnic groups improve farm tools and develop production, the People's Government of the Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Region allocated special funds to build five farm tool factories in counties such as Ledong. Currently, the farm tool factory in Ledong County can produce 4,000 plows and 1,000 hoes per month, with very good quality, and is welcomed by the Li and Miao people. Each farm tool factory is also preparing to recruit young people from the Li and Miao ethnic groups to train them as farm tool manufacturing workers.

    海南黎族苗族人民生活改善人口逐年增多
    自治区人民政府设立农具厂帮助人民改良农具发展生产
    广东省海南黎族苗族自治区人口兴旺。在保亭、白沙、东方、琼中、乐东五个县，解放后出生的小孩就有四万二千八百多个，占五县总人口百分之十五点二。过去婴儿死亡现象严重的保亭县，现在人们经常可以看到一群群黝黑结实的小孩子，在夕阳斜照的椰林下嬉戏。山脚下盖了一些新房舍，不少人家的门上都挂着“布嫒”（吊床）或藤箩，里面酣睡着婴孩。琼中县牙纺村住有四十户苗民，解放前不到十个小孩，现在已经有了三十多个。村里前年、去年还缺粮，今年早稻已经够食了。黎族、苗族人民过去在国民党反动派残酷统治压榨下，生活非常贫困，他们大都一年只有半年粮，冬天没有被子，夏天没有蚊帐，医药卫生更谈不上。解放以后，人民政府为了扶助黎族、苗族人民发展生产，改善生活，三年来不断发放巨款兴修水利，救济贫困，并发放无偿农具，使粮食增产。今年黎族、苗族人民已基本上消灭了粮荒。人民政府并在自治区设立了三十七个医疗机构，给各族人民免费治疗疾病和进行各种预防注射，肃清了每年盛行的天花，大大减少了肺炎、恶性疟疾、痢疾等疾病。黎族、苗族人民的生活改善后，人口逐年增多。

    广东省海南黎族苗族自治区人民政府最近在黎族、苗族人民聚居的乐东、保亭、白沙、琼中、东方五县设立了五个农具厂。海南黎族苗族自治区黎族、苗族农民过去在耕作时都使用木犁、木耙等落后农具，生产效率极低。解放后，人民政府从汉族地区运去大批铁制农具帮助他们发展生产，但因交通不便或农具种类和当地使用习惯不合等关系，仍不能满足黎族、苗族人民的需要。为了进一步帮助各族人民改良农具，发展生产，海南黎族苗族自治区人民政府特拨款在乐东等县筹建五个农具厂。目前，乐东县的农具厂每月可产犁四千件、锄头一千件，质量很好，受到黎族、苗族人民的欢迎。各农具厂并准备招收黎族、苗族青年子弟，培养他们成为制造农具的工人。（新华社）
