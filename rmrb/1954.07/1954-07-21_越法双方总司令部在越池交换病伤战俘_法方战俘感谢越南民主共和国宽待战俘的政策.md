    The representative of the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army handed over 99 sick and wounded prisoners of war to the French side, including 18 French, 48 Moroccans, Algerians, Tunisians, and Senegalese, 23 Swedes, Germans, Austrians, and Spaniards, and 10 puppet troops.

    The representative of the French Union Forces in Indochina handed over 100 prisoners of war to the Vietnam People's Army, including 74 wounded and 26 sick, among whom were some civilians and guerrillas.

    Before leaving the liberated area by plane, the released prisoners of war from the French side expressed their gratitude to President Ho Chi Minh and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam for the humane policy adopted towards them. They thanked the local residents and the cadres and staff of the Vietnamese People's Army's medical units for their care.

Xinhua News Agency, July 20th: According to Vietnam News Agency, North Vietnam, July 20th: French Union Forces prisoners of war handed over to the French side by the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army on July 15th in Việt Trì said, "We thank President Ho Chi Minh and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam for their lenient and humane policy towards prisoners of war."

    Tunisian Trudi Mabik and French Sergeant Paul Lapligne described their lives in the prisoner-of-war camp in detail to the Vietnam News Agency reporter:

    "We get up around 5:30 every morning and do morning exercises. We start work at eight o'clock, planting vegetables, chopping firewood, doing sanitation work, etc. Our daily work is mainly to improve our living conditions."

    "We stop working at 10:30 for meals. We get 800 grams of rice every day, which is the same as the ration for a regular Vietnamese soldier. There is meat with almost every meal. This is normal food, and the sick have chicken, duck, sugar, milk, or eggs. We have enough eggs because we raise some chickens in the POW camp. The sick are carefully cared for by Vietnamese doctors. We take quinine pills every eight days to prevent malaria. Tobacco is also distributed regularly, and many of us can also grow tobacco for our own use."

    "Every evening we gather to check our work during the day or listen to the news. In the afternoon and on Sundays, we often go to the library in our POW camp. Germans can read German newspapers and magazines. In addition, we publish a wall newspaper ourselves, on which we can freely express our opinions on various issues."

    "In the afternoon or on Sundays, we play volleyball and other ball games with the Vietnamese cadres in the POW camp. As for clothing, we each get two sets of Vietnamese-style clothes, two more sets of Western-style clothes, underwear, towels, and shoes every year. Everyone gets blankets, mosquito nets, and mats."

    Sergeant Lapligne added: "Today, I am very happy to be reunited with my family, and I express my gratitude to the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. I have realized the truth about this dirty war in Indochina. I promise to work with the French people to stop this dirty war."

    A French prisoner of war named Stefan said in a moving tone that only in a truly democratic country can there be such a humane policy towards prisoners of war.

    法方战俘感谢越南民主共和国宽待战俘的政策
    【新华社十九日讯】越南通讯社北越十九日讯：为了执行中亦军事会议所达成的协议，越南人民军总司令部和印度支那法兰西联邦部队总司令部的代表在七月十五日和十六日上午在越池城交换了病伤战俘。
    越南人民军总司令部的代表向法国方面移交了九十九名病伤战俘，其中包括法国人十八名，摩洛哥人、阿尔及利亚人、突尼斯人和塞内加尔人四十八名，瑞典人、德国人、奥地利人和西班牙人二十三名，傀儡军十名。
    印度支那法兰西联邦部队的代表向越南人民军方面移交了一百名战俘，其中包括七十四名伤员和二十六名病员，在这些病伤人员中，有若干是平民和游击队员。
    被释放的法国方面的战俘在乘飞机离开解放区以前，对胡志明主席和越南民主共和国政府对他们所采取的人道政策表示感激。他们感谢当地的居民，并感谢越南人民军的卫生单位的干部和工作人员对他们的照顾。
      【新华社二十日讯】据越南通讯社北越二十日讯：越南人民军总司令部七月十五日在越池移交给法国方面的法兰西联邦部队战俘说，我们感谢胡志明主席和越南民主共和国政府对待战俘的宽大和人道的政策。
    突尼斯人特鲁迪马比克和法国人上士保罗·拉普里涅向越南通讯社记者详细叙述了他们在战俘营的生活：
    我们每天早晨五点半左右起床并作早操。在八点开始工作，种菜、打柴，做卫生工作等。我们每天的工作主要是为了改善我们的生活条件。
    我们在十点半停止工作用餐。我们每天得到八百克的大米，等于一个越南正规军战士的口粮数量。差不多每餐都有肉。这是正常的饭食，病号另有鸡、鸭、糖、牛奶或鸡蛋。我们有足够的鸡蛋，因为我们在战俘营中养了些鸡。病号受到越南医生的细心照顾。每隔八天我们吃奎宁丸预防疟疾。烟草也定期发给，我们有许多人还可以种植烟草以供自用。
    每天傍晚我们聚在一起检查我们白天的工作或听新闻。在下午和星期日我们常常到我们战俘营的图书馆去。德国人可以读德文书报。此外，我们自己出版了一份墙报，在那上面我们能够自由地表达我们对各种问题的意见。
    在下午或星期日，我们和战俘营里的越南干部
  一起玩排球和其他球戏。至于衣服方面，我们每人每年得到两套越南式衣服、另外两套西式衣服和内衣、毛巾、鞋子。每个人都得到毯子、蚊帐和席子。
    拉普里涅上士又说：今天，我很高兴能和家人重聚，并对越南民主共和国政府表示谢意。我已经认识到印度支那这场肮脏战争的真相。我保证要和法国人民一道，努力促使这场肮脏的战争停止。
      一个叫做斯丹凡的法国战俘用动人的口吻说，只有在一个真正民主的国家才能有这样一种对待战俘的人道政策。
