Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, July 21st. Special correspondent Shen Jiantu reports: The armistice agreements on the cessation of hostilities in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia were signed here this morning and at noon respectively. A plenary session will be held this afternoon to approve these agreements and other documents concerning the armistice and restoration of peace in Indochina. This will bring the Geneva Conference, which has lasted for nearly three months, to a victorious conclusion.

The final agreement could have been signed before midnight on the 20th if the Cambodian delegation had not caused delays at the last minute. When the plenary session was about to begin on the evening of the 20th, the Cambodian Foreign Minister suddenly failed to abide by the agreement reached in contact with other foreign ministers. American newspapers have reported that the U.S. delegation's recent contacts with the Cambodian delegation have been particularly frequent.

By 8:30 p.m. on the 20th, photographers and cameramen had arrived in the hall of the Palais des Nations waiting for the plenary session to begin. A large number of reporters from all countries came to the Palais des Nations and the "Press Building" to wait for the signing of the agreement. As news of the Cambodian delegation causing trouble at the last minute emerged and as people's expectations for the signing increased, the atmosphere became increasingly tense. The two chairmen of the conference, Foreign Minister Molotov and Foreign Secretary Eden, along with Foreign Minister Mendès-France and Acting Foreign Minister Pham Van Dong, continued to talk with the Cambodian Foreign Minister until after midnight. The American delegation watched from the sidelines.

Close to midnight, delegation cars kept arriving with documents and typewriters. Delegation members busily walked in and out of offices near the conference room carrying large bundles of documents.

After midnight, it was decided that the armistice agreements for Vietnam and Laos would be signed first. At 2:45 a.m., when the loudspeakers announced that the armistice agreements would be signed in about half an hour, cheers of "Hurray" erupted in the "Press Building." The armistice agreements for Vietnam and Laos were finally signed at 3:30 a.m.

As a result of the foreign ministers' talks, the Cambodian delegation finally abandoned its uncompromising position. It was announced on the morning of the 21st that the armistice agreement for Cambodia would be signed. Photographers and cameramen waited at the Palais des Nations around 10 a.m. for the signing. It was said that the armistice agreement would be signed around 11:30 a.m. However, in the "Press Building," there was news that the Cambodian delegation could not be found to sign. Then there was news that the agreement would be signed at 12:15 p.m. At 12:30 p.m., the Cambodian armistice agreement was finally signed.

The Geneva Conference—which the American propaganda machine tried to write off as a failure from the very beginning—finally succeeded due to the major and harmonious efforts of the delegations of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and France, representing the belligerent parties. The assistance of the Soviet Union, China, and the United Kingdom also played a positive role in promoting the success of the conference.

The Geneva Conference, attended by the five major powers, has become another historic milestone in the peaceful settlement of international disputes and the easing of world tensions through negotiations around the conference table. Another historic milestone was the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement at Panmunjom less than a year ago, which was the result of more than two years of struggle by the Korean and Chinese delegations, together with peace-loving people all over the world, to achieve a fair and reasonable armistice. The discussion on the peaceful settlement of the Korean question at the Geneva Conference was unilaterally interrupted by the U.S. delegation on orders from Washington. The peaceful settlement of the Korean question remains an outstanding world problem, and this problem must be solved in order for Asia and the world to achieve lasting peace.

Conference participants here praised the success of the Geneva Conference as another great achievement in moving towards solving outstanding world problems to achieve lasting peace and security. The legitimate rights and constructive role of the People's Republic of China in the international arena have become more obvious and can no longer be denied. A new era in which Asian countries will play an important historical role in international affairs has begun with the successful conclusion of the Geneva Conference.

    新华社记者报道停战协定签字之日的情况
    【新华社日内瓦二十一日电】本社特派记者沈建图报道：关于在越南、老挝和柬埔寨停止敌对行动的停战协定，已在二十一日清晨和中午分别在这里签字。二十一日下午将举行全体会议，来批准这些协定和关于在印度支那停战和恢复和平的其他文件。这将使进行了将近三个月的日内瓦会议胜利结束。
    如果柬埔寨代表团不在最后一分钟造成拖延的话，最后的协定本来是可以在二十日子夜以前签订的。当二十日晚上快要举行全体会议的时候，柬埔寨王国外交大臣突然不遵守在和其他外长们接触中取得的协议了。美国报纸曾报道说，美国代表团同柬埔寨王国代表团最近的接触特别频繁。
    到二十日晚八点半的时候，摄影记者们和摄影师们已到国联大厦大厅等待全体会议开始。来自一切国家的大批记者，来到国联大厦和“新闻大厦”等待协定签字。随着柬埔寨代表团在最后一刻引起了麻烦的消息的出现和人们对签字的期待，气氛变得愈来愈紧张。会议的两位主席莫洛托夫外长和艾登外交大臣同孟戴斯—弗朗斯外长和范文同代外长一起继续跟柬埔寨王国外交大臣一直谈到子夜以后。美国代表团在一旁观望。
    到将近子夜的时候，代表团的汽车不断带着文件和打字机到达。代表团的人员带着大捆文件忙着走出走进会议室附近的办公室。
    在子夜以后，决定关于越南和老挝的停战协定将首先签订。上午两点四十五分，当扩音器宣布停战协定将在半小时左右签字的时候，“新闻大厦”里发出了“万岁”的欢呼声。越南和老挝的停战协定终于在上午三时半签字了。
    由于外长们会谈的结果，柬埔寨代表团最后终于放弃了它的不妥协的立场。二十一日早晨宣布，关于柬埔寨的停战协定将要签订。摄影记者们和摄影师们十时左右在国联大厦等待签字。据说停战协定将在十一时三十分左右签字。但在“新闻大厦”，有消息说，找不到柬埔寨王国代表来签字。又有消息说协定将在十二时十五分签字。在中午十二时三十分柬埔寨停战协定终于签字了。
    日内瓦会议——美国宣传机器从一开始就企图把它说成要失败而把它一笔勾销的——终于因越南民主共和国和法国两国代表团所代表的交战双方的重大的和和谐的努力而获得了成功。苏联，中国和英国三大国的协助，在促使会议成功上也起了积极的作用。
    有五大国参加的日内瓦会议已成为通过围绕着会议桌来谈判以和平解决国际争端及缓和世界紧张局势的又一个历史性的里程碑。另外一个历史性的里程碑，就是不到一年前的板门店朝鲜停战协定的签字，这一协定的签字是朝中代表团和全世界爱好和平的人民一起，为了争取公平合理的停战而进行了两年多斗争的结果。日内瓦会议关于和平解决朝鲜问题的讨论已被美国代表团根据华盛顿的命令片面地中断。和平解决朝鲜问题仍然是一个悬而未决的世界问题，要使亚洲和世界获得稳定的和平，就得要解决这个问题。
    这里的会议人士称赞日内瓦会议的成功是走向解决悬而未决的世界问题以实现持久和平和安全方面的另一个巨大成就。中华人民共和国在国际上的合法权利和建设性的作用已变得更加明显，不能再被人否认了。亚洲国家将在国际事务中起重要的历史性作用的新时代，已随着日内瓦会议胜利结束而开始了。
