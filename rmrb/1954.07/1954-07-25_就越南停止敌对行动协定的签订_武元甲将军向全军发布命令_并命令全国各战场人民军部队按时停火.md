Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, July 24th: Vietnam News Agency, North Vietnam, July 24th: General Vo Nguyen Giap, Commander-in-Chief of the Vietnamese People's Army, issued an order to commanders and fighters of the People's Army throughout the country regarding the signing of the Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities in Vietnam. The full text of the order is as follows: "To all commanders and fighters of the regular forces, local forces, militia and guerrillas throughout the country:

The Geneva Conference achieved great success on July 21, 1954. An agreement on the cessation of hostilities between our army and the French Union Forces in Indochina has been signed. The countries participating in the conference have recognized the complete independence, sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of our country.

The Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities in Vietnam signed at the Geneva Conference is a great victory for the people of our country and the world peace and democracy camp, and at the same time a heavy defeat for the imperialist warmongers. This great victory is the result of the heroic and arduous patriotic war waged by our army and the people of our country and the people of Indochina for eight or nine years. It is also the result of the struggle of the people of France and the world for peace and democracy.

However, the ceasefire is only the first step towards restoring peace in Vietnam and Indochina. The southern part of our country must still serve as a temporary regroupment area for the French Union Forces. Our army and the people of our country must continue to struggle for general elections, to consolidate peace, and to achieve national unity, independence and democracy. We must remember that warmongers may try to undermine the ceasefire and peace. Therefore, all commanders and fighters of the People's Army must maintain and consolidate their fighting spirit, constantly heighten their vigilance, and be prepared to crush any conspiracy by the saboteurs of peace at any time.

In order to smoothly restore and consolidate peace in Vietnam and Indochina, I order all commanders and fighters of the People's Army throughout the country from north to south:

1.  Clearly recognize the significance of the victory in the Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities in Vietnam, fully trust the wise leadership of President Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnam Workers' Party, and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and correctly and strictly implement the agreement.

2.  Cease fire along the entire Vietnamese front according to the date and time to be communicated to the entire army later.

3.  Constantly heighten vigilance and guard against all provocations and sabotage activities by the belligerent elements.

4.  Protect and assist the International Supervisory Commission and the Joint Commission responsible for supervising and monitoring the implementation of the Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities.

As members of the People's Army under the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh, the Party, and the Government, all commanders and fighters must demonstrate fervent patriotism and high vigilance, strictly abide by discipline, and resolutely carry out the struggle to achieve peace, unity, independence, and democracy for the entire territory of our beloved motherland, Vietnam.

        General Vo Nguyen Giap, Commander-in-Chief of the Vietnamese People's Army (signature)
                    July 22, 1954"

    就越南停止敌对行动协定的签订
    武元甲将军向全军发布命令
    并命令全国各战场人民军部队按时停火
    【新华社二十四日讯】越南通讯社北越二十四日讯：越南人民军总司令武元甲将军就越南停止敌对行动协定的签订，向全国人民军指挥员和战斗员发布命令，命令全文如下：“全国正规部队、地方部队、民兵和游击队的全体指挥员和战斗员们：
    日内瓦会议在一九五四年七月二十一日已获得很大的成就。我军和印度支那法兰西联邦部队之间的停止敌对行动协定已经签订了。参加会议的国家已承认我们祖国的完全独立、主权、统一和领土完整。
    在日内瓦会议上签订的越南停止敌对行动协定，是我国人民和世界和平民主阵营的一个伟大胜利，同时也是帝国主义战争贩子的一个惨重失败。这个伟大胜利是我军和我国人民以及印度支那各国人民进行了八、九年英勇艰苦的爱国战争的结果。它也是法国和全世界的人民争取和平民主的斗争的结果。
    但是停战只是走向恢复越南和印度支那的和平的第一步。我们祖国的南部仍然必须作为法兰西联邦部队的暂时集结地区。我军和我国人民必须继续为进行普选、巩固和平、实现全国的统一、独立和民主而斗争。我们必须记住，战争贩子们可能要破坏停战和和平。因此，人民军的全体指挥员和战斗员必须保持并巩固作战精神，不断提高警惕，并准备随时粉碎和平破坏者的任何阴谋。
    为了顺利地恢复和巩固越南和印度支那的和平，我命令全国从北部到南部的人民军全体指挥员和战斗员：
    一、明确认识越南停止敌对行动协定中的胜利意义，充分信任胡志明主席、越南劳动党和越南民主共和国政府的英明领导，正确地和严格地执行协定。
    二、按照以后将向全军传达的日期和时间，在越南全线停火。
    三、不断提高警惕，提防好战分子的一切挑衅和破坏行为。
    四、保护并协助负责监督和监察执行停止敌对行动协定的国际监察委员会和联合委员会。
    作为胡志明主席、党和政府领导下的人民军的一员，全体指挥员和战斗员必须表现热诚的爱国精神和高度的警惕，严格遵守纪律，坚决进行斗争，使我们亲爱的祖国越南全部领土获得和平、统一、独立和民主。
        越南人民军总司令武元甲将军（签名）
                    一九五四年七月二十二日”
    【新华社二十四日讯】越南通讯社北越二十四日讯：越南人民军总司令武元甲将军七月二十三日向全国各地的所有越南人民军正规部队和地方部队、民兵和游击队发布停火命令。命令全文如下：
