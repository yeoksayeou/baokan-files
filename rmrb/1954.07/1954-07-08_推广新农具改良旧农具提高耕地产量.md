Promote New Farm Tools, Improve Old Farm Tools, Increase Crop Yields

    Two Harvests from One Field
    Beside a small road in Gongping Township, Wenjiang County, Sichuan Province, there is a wheat field, half of which has wheat growing well, and the other half has wheat growing poorly. This is a field where the Wang Zicheng mutual aid team tested plowing with new and old plows respectively. Last autumn, the county farm plowed the fields with new-style walking plows. The Wang Zicheng mutual aid team's field was close to the county farm's field, so the team members also learned from the county farm, plowing half of the field with the new-style walking plow and the other half with the old plow. When the wheat seedlings were just growing, the difference between the two sides was not very big, but after spring came, the difference gradually became significant. The wheat seedlings plowed with the new plow were several inches taller than those plowed with the old plow, and the ears were also neater and thicker. After harvesting, the half plowed with the new-style walking plow yielded more than 15% more than the other half.
    The Eight-Wheel Live-Tooth Harrow is Highly Efficient
    During the Spring Festival this year, after the members of the Sanyou Township Gan Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in Binyang County, Guangxi Province, visited a tractor demonstration, everyone felt that if the old-style harrow was improved according to the principle of the tractor disc harrow, it would definitely improve work efficiency. After discussion, the cooperative designated Gan Baogui and Gan Guoqing, who were skilled in carpentry, to be responsible for research. After their hard work, they finally transformed the old-style harrow into an eight-wheel live-tooth harrow. According to the test results, the old-style harrow can harrow two mu in the same amount of time, while the eight-wheel live-tooth harrow can harrow three mu, and the soil is looser and more broken. Harrows once with the new harrow is equal to harrowing twice with the old one. After the new harrow was made, the farmers in the whole township were very happy. The township party branch focused on organizing twenty mutual aid team leaders to visit. After the visit, many mutual aid teams were also preparing to use the eight-wheel live-tooth harrow.
    The New-Style Walking Plow is Well-Received
    When the Hubei Province New Farm Tool Experiment Station promoted the new-style walking plow in Dukou Township, Wuchang County, last February, the masses believed that the new-style plow was too heavy for the cattle to pull, and the price was higher than the old plow. Therefore, the work of promoting new farm tools was hindered. In October, the county's Agriculture and Forestry Section sent cadres from the New Farm Tool Experiment Station to the township to promote it again. This time, they used three mu of land belonging to the county's labor model, Yan Guichou, and plowed half of it with the new and old plows respectively, with the same fertilizer and seeds. At harvest time, the wheat grown with the new-style plow was more than three inches taller than that grown with the old-style plow, the stalks were stronger, and the ears were also larger. In this way, the new-style plow was generally welcomed by the farmers in the township. Now the whole township has purchased forty-four new-style plows. This year, all the farmers in the township can use the new plow to plow the fields.
    The New Walking Plow is Stable and Flexible
    The Shengjiazhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Pan County, Guizhou Province, bought a seven-inch walking plow, but because they didn't know how to use it, many mutual aid teams that originally planned to buy a seven-inch walking plow didn't want to buy it anymore. After learning about this situation, the Pan County Farm invited representatives from the cooperative and six perennial mutual aid teams to learn how to use the walking plow. After the farm comrades' explanation and demonstration, the representatives learned how to use the walking plow to plow triangular and square fields in less than three hours. The plowed land was uniformly deep, the turned-up soil was loose and flat, and turning was convenient and flexible. The representatives were all very happy. A few days later, the Shengjiazhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative's walking plow was put into use. The Liu Sijing mutual aid team also bought a walking plow to plant corn, and two other mutual aid teams contacted the supply and marketing cooperative and were also preparing to buy a seven-inch walking plow.
    The Double-Headed Hoe Increases Thinning Efficiency
    The Guyanli Agricultural Production Cooperative in Guzhuang Township, Xuchang County, Henan Province, planted twenty-six mu of early millet this year, and now is the tense time for thinning seedlings. The members have long recognized the benefits of leaving single seedlings, but it has not been realized because hand thinning is too slow. In order to solve this problem, the cooperative's technical research group, with the help of the Xuchang Special District Agricultural Technology Extension Station, divided the hoe blade of the hoe used by the masses in the past for thinning seedlings into three parts, removed the middle one, and made a double-headed hoe. After thinning the seedlings horizontally with the double-headed hoe according to the original method, and then pulling them out by hand, the efficiency is about twice as high as pulling the seedlings by hand. After the successful trial production, the cooperative then made three more double-headed hoes. Farmers throughout the township saw that the double-headed hoe left seedlings evenly and was easy to use, and they all bought double-headed hoes.
    Machine Planting of Cotton is Fast and Good
    During the spring plowing season, the Xingping County Agricultural Machinery Tractor Station in Shaanxi Province used a double-row cotton seeder trial-produced by the Northwest Agricultural Implement Research Institute to sow seeds in the fourteen mu of cotton fields of the Xu Jingzhang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Douma Township. Eight days after sowing, the cotton seedlings emerged completely, two days earlier than the seedlings sown by farmers using wooden plows to make furrows. Because the machine sowing depth was appropriate, the seedlings grew strongly and uniformly. This machine is very light, and only one medium-sized cow is needed to pull it. The sowing amount, sowing depth, and row spacing can all be adjusted at will. After seeing it, the farmers all said: Machine planting is fast, good, and really beautiful!
      Only After Using the New Plow Do You Know Its Benefits
      "New-style farm tools are bulky, and I'm afraid they won't be able to plow to the edges and corners of the land." This was the concern of some mutual aid team leaders in five townships, including Wufu Township in Mianzhu County, Sichuan Province, before they saw a double-wheeled single-share plow plowing the fields with their own eyes. In April, the Wufu Township Agricultural Technology Extension Station held an agricultural technology research meeting, reporting on the advantages of new-style farm tools, but it did not eliminate these concerns. Some mutual aid team leaders said: "We won't know whether this plow is good or not until we plow it in the field." So, they organized everyone to go to the Wulidun Agricultural Production Cooperative, where members used new-style farm tools to plow the fields for everyone to see, and invited the cooperative director and some members to explain the benefits of new-style farm tools based on their own personal experience, and introduced the operating methods. Wang Shunshuang, the leader of the Qitian Township mutual aid team, used the new plow himself and said to everyone with satisfaction: The plow is very light and flexible, and both men and women can plow it. As long as the plowshare is adjusted narrower, it can plow to the edges and corners of the land. Seeing the benefits of the Agricultural Production Cooperative using new-style farm tools with their own eyes, the team leaders borrowed all six double-wheeled single-share plows from the extension station.
      Saves Labor, is Deep and Loose
    In the past, farmers who grew vegetables used manpower to dig the land, using large hoes one after another, so the depth was uneven, which hindered the growth of vegetables. The work of digging the land was also mostly concentrated in one time, and often due to insufficient labor, it affected the timely planting of vegetables, resulting in reduced production. The Agricultural Guidance Section of the Tiexi District People's Government in Shenyang City tried using a new-style walking plow to turn the land in the First Joint Group of Fuguan Village in mid-April this year, and the effect was very good. The new-style walking plow can not only completely replace manual digging, but also save twenty-four man-days per hectare and increase efficiency four times. At the same time, it can also increase soil fertility, increase soil temperature, and reduce weeds and pests. After the trial turning, many vegetable farmers realized that it is good to use a walking plow to turn the land, saving labor, being deep and loose. Now the organized vegetable farmers in the whole district have begun to adopt the method of using new-style walking plows to turn the land.
      The "Hanging Plow" is Put to Use
    Last year, the Xiamachanghu Village in Mi Spring County, Xinjiang Province, borrowed four new-style walking plows, but because no one knew how to use them, they became "hanging plows." This spring, after mutual aid team leader Shen Buyun participated in a mutual aid cooperation training class, he had great enthusiasm for improving farming techniques and increasing production. In order to encourage everyone to use the new walking plow to plow the fields, he introduced to everyone the methods he learned in the county, and also pulled the new-style walking plow to the field for testing. After seeing the benefits of the new-style walking plow, everyone unanimously reflected: "Last year, we only blamed the new-style walking plow for not working well; we didn't blame ourselves for not being patient enough to study it, and we let these four new-style walking plows rest for a year in vain."
    Now these four new-style walking plows are all being used, and another one has been newly purchased.

    推广新农具改良旧农具提高耕地产量
    一块地里两样收成
    四川省温江县公平乡的一条小马路旁，有一块麦田，半块田的麦子长得好，半块田的麦子长得坏。这就是王子成互助组试用新旧犁分别耕种的一块田。去年秋耕时，县农场用新式步犁耕田。王子成互助组的田靠近县农场的田，组员们也学习县农场，半块田用新式步犁耕，另半块仍用旧犁耕。当麦苗刚刚生长出来时，两边的麦苗差别还不太大，春天到来以后，差别就渐渐显著起来，新犁耕的麦苗比旧犁耕的要高几寸，结的穗子也整齐粗大，收割以后，用新式步犁耕的半块比那半块田增产百分之十五以上。
    八轮活齿耙的效率高
    今年春节时，广西省宾阳县三友乡甘村农业生产合作社的社员，参观了拖拉机表演以后，大家感到如果把旧式耙按照拖拉机圆盘耙的原理改良一下，一定能提高工作效率。经讨论后，社里便指定会做木工的社员甘宝贵、甘国清负责研究。经过他俩人努力钻研，终于把旧式耙改造成八轮活齿耙。根据试验结果，同一时间内，旧式耙耙二亩，八轮活齿耙可耙三亩，而且泥土松碎。新耙耙一遍等于旧式耙耙两遍。新耙制成后，全乡农民都非常高兴。该乡党支部重点组织了二十个互助组长来参观。参观后，许多互助组也都准备使用八轮活齿耙了。
    新式步犁受到欢迎
    去年二月间，湖北省新式农具试验站在武昌县渡口乡推广新式步犁时，群众认为新式犁太重牛拉不动，价钱又比旧犁高，因此，推广新农具的工作受到了阻碍。十月间，该县农林科又派新式农具试验站的干部到该乡推广，这次是用该乡劳动模范晏癸丑的三亩地，用新、旧犁各犁种一半，肥料、种籽都是一样。收割时，新式犁耕种的麦子比旧式犁耕的要高三寸多，麦秆长的壮，麦穗也大。这样新式犁便受到该乡农民普遍欢迎了。现在全乡已购买了新式犁四十四部。今年内，全乡农民都可使用新犁犁田了。
    新步犁耕地又稳又灵活
    贵州省盘县盛家庄农业生产合作社买了一台七吋步犁，因不会使用，原来很多打算买七吋步犁的互助组，也就不想买了。盘县农场知道这个情况后，即邀请了该社和六个常年互助组的代表前来学习步犁的使用法。经过农场同志的讲解和实地表演，不到三个钟头，代表们便学会用步犁犁三角田和方形田了。犁过的地深浅一致，翻上来的土又松又平，转弯倒拐也方便灵活。代表们都很高兴。几天后，盛家庄农业生产合作社的步犁就下地了。刘四敬互助组也买了一台步犁点种苞谷，还有两个互助组与供销社接头，也准备购买七吋步犁。
    双头锄间苗效率高
    河南省许昌县谷庄乡谷彦离农业生产合作社，今年种了二十六亩早谷，现在正是间苗十分紧张的时候。社员们早就认识到单株留苗的好处，但因用手间苗太慢，没有实现。为了解决这个问题，该社技术研究小组在许昌专区农业技术推广站的帮助下，根据群众的耕作习惯，把群众过去间苗锄的锄板分成三份，将中间的一份去掉，制成双头锄。用双头锄按原来的横法把苗横后，再用手拔，就比用手拔苗的效率提高两倍左右。试制成功后，社里接着又打了三张双头锄。全乡农民看到双头锄留苗均匀，使用轻便，大家都纷纷买双头锄。
    机器种棉花又快又好
    春耕时，陕西省兴平县农业机器拖拉机站利用西北农具研究所试制的双行棉花播种机，在窦马乡许敬章农业生产合作社的十四亩棉地里进行了播种。播种八天以后，棉苗便全部出齐，比农民用木犁冲沟播种的早出苗两天。由于机器播种深浅合适，所以幼苗生长健壮整齐。这种机器很轻，只要
  一头中等牛就可以牵曳。播种量、播种深浅、行距都可以随意调节。农民看后都说：机器种地又快、又好、真是美！
      用过新犁才晓得它的好处
      “新式农具笨重，怕犁不到地的边边角角。”这是四川省绵竹县五福等五个乡的部分互助组长在没有亲眼看到双轮一铧犁耕田前的顾虑。四月间，五福乡农业技术推广站召开了农业技术研究会，报告了新式农具的优点，可是并没有能消除这些顾虑。有的互助组长说：“到底这犁头好不好，我们要到田里犁了才晓得。”于是，便组织大家到五里墩农业生产合作社，由社员用新式农具实地犁给大家看，并请社长和部分社员用自己亲身的经验，说明新式农具的好处，介绍了操作方法。齐天乡互助组长王顺双亲手使用了新犁，满意地对大家说：犁头很轻便、灵巧，男女都能犁，只要把犁头调整窄点，就可以犁到地的边边角角了。组长们亲眼看到农业生产合作社使用新式农具的好处，于是便把推广站的六部双轮一铧犁全都借走了。
      省工省力，又深又松
    过去，种菜的农民刨地都是用人力，拿着大镐一下挨一下的刨，这样深浅不匀，妨碍蔬菜生长。刨地这个活又大部是集中在一个时间，往往因劳动不足，影响蔬菜及时定植，以致造成减产。沈阳市铁西区人民政府农业指导科，今年四月中旬在富官村第一联组试用新式步犁翻地，效果很好，新式步犁不但完全可以代替人力刨地，而且每垧地还可以节省二十四个人工，提高效率四倍。同时还可增进土壤肥力，增加土温、减少杂草和病虫害。试翻后，许多菜农都认识到用步犁翻地好，省工省力，又深又松。现在全区组织起来的菜农开始采用了新式步犁翻地的办法。
      “挂犁”下地了
    去年，新疆省米泉县下马场湖村贷了四架新式步犁，因没人会使用变成了“挂犁”。今年春天，互助组长沈布云参加了互助合作训练班学习以后，他对改进耕作技术提高产量的劲头很大，为了带动大家使用新步犁犁田，他就给大家介绍他在县里学到的使用方法，同时还把新式步犁拉到地里试验。大家看到新式步犁的好处后，一致反映说：“去年咱们光怪新式步犁不好使；就没有怪咱们自己没耐心钻研，白叫这四架新式步犁休息了一年。”
    现在这四架新式步犁都使用起来了，而且又新买了一架。
