Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, July 25th.

Respected Chairman, Respected Premier, Dear Comrades and Friends:

I am deeply honored to be able to visit the German Democratic Republic after the Geneva Conference and to meet with the citizens of Berlin here. Now, please allow me, on behalf of the government and people of the People's Republic of China, to extend warm respects to the citizens of Berlin and, through you, to the entire German people.

The German Democratic Republic and the People's Republic of China are two fraternal countries that were born in 1949. Since its establishment, the German Democratic Republic has achieved tremendous successes in politics, economy, and culture. As the capital of Germany, Berlin has seen such magnificent and beautiful buildings as those on Stalin Avenue in the years since the establishment of the German Democratic Republic. This kind of construction not only marks the achievements of the German people's conscious labor, but also symbolizes the great future of the entire Germany. Because the German Democratic Republic is becoming increasingly consolidated politically and economically, it has now become a decisive fortress for striving for the peaceful reunification of the entire Germany and thereby safeguarding peace in Europe.

As everyone knows, five months ago, the Four Foreign Ministers Conference was held right here in Berlin, the capital of Germany. As a result of the Berlin Conference, the Geneva Conference was convened in April this year to discuss the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and the restoration of peace in Indochina. Although the Korean issue did not achieve the agreement it deserved due to an artificial obstruction, it has not been removed from the agenda and still requires our continued efforts. As for the restoration of peace in Indochina, it finally overcame various difficulties and not only reached an agreement on the cessation of hostilities in Indochina, bringing peace to the people of Indochina and the French people, but also reached a principled agreement on resolving political issues. The achievement of various agreements at the Geneva Conference on the restoration of peace in Indochina proves that peace has once again triumphed over war. It has also further eased the current international tensions. No matter how many obstacles we need to overcome in the future, this situation cannot but have a huge impact on the resolution of the German issue.

Undoubtedly, the issue of peaceful reunification has now become a major issue related to the vital interests of every German. This issue should mainly be resolved by the German people themselves. In order to guarantee the right of the German people to resolve their own national issues, Comrade Molotov, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Government, suggested during the Berlin Conference that both the government the German Democratic Republic and the West German government should participate in the discussion of the resolution of the German issue, and should consult on issues related to the peaceful reunification of Germany. This is a fair and reasonable principle. We believe that, based on the experience of discussing the restoration of peace in Indochina, this principle should no longer be rejected today.

The Chinese people are concerned about peace in Asia and also about peace in Europe. In order to maintain peace in Asia, we advocate that Asian countries should hold consultations with each other. In order to maintain peace in Europe, we hope that European countries should first consult with each other on issues of guaranteeing European peace and security. The consolidation of peace in Europe depends on the resolution of the German issue. We believe that if all relevant countries have peaceful sincerity, the German issue can be resolved through consultation.

However, some people still insist on not allowing the issue of peaceful reunification of Germany to be resolved. These people want to maintain world tensions as much as possible, are obsessed with the so-called policy of strength, and attempt to continuously instigate and organize opposing military blocs in Asia and Europe in order to profit from them. However, apart from these people, what the people of Europe, the people of Asia, and the people of the world hope for is not division and confrontation, but the peaceful coexistence of countries with different social systems.

Facts have proven that countries with different social systems can coexist peacefully. Today, more and more countries in the world are in favor of peaceful coexistence, and those who advocate division and confrontation are becoming increasingly isolated.

Here, I must also mention the friendly relations between the German Democratic Republic and the People's Republic of China. The friendship between the two great nations of China and Germany is profound. Since 1949, the German Democratic Republic and the People's Republic of China have begun cooperation on a new basis. The prospects for cooperation between China and Germany are bright, whether in terms of economic trade or cultural exchanges. At the same time, I firmly believe that the peaceful reunification of Germany will be helpful in promoting the development of economic trade and cultural exchanges between China and Germany.

The German people are a great people. The achievements of the German people in science, culture, and art are brilliant. Germany's industrial production and technological level are world-renowned.

The German people's unremitting struggle for the peaceful reunification of Germany today is by no means isolated, and it is supported by peace-loving people all over the world. I firmly believe that the German people's desire for a peaceful and unified Germany will definitely be realized. A peaceful, unified, independent, and democratic Germany will play its great role in the peaceful international family.

A peaceful, unified, independent, and democratic Germany will make beneficial contributions to the peaceful world in industrial production and science and technology, and bring happiness to the people of the world. Dear comrades and friends, let us shout: Long live peaceful reunification and national independence for Germany! Long live the German Democratic Republic! Long live President Wilhelm Pieck! Long live the friendship between the peoples of China and Germany! Long live the forces of peace and democracy headed by the Soviet Union!

### 七月二十四日在柏林市群众大会上  周恩来总理的演说

    七月二十四日在柏林市群众大会上
    周恩来总理的演说敬爱的主席同志，敬爱的总理同志，亲爱的同志们和朋友们：
    我能在日内瓦会议之后访问德意志民主共和国，并能在这里与柏林市民们见面，深感荣幸。现在，请允许我代表中华人民共和国政府和人民，向柏林市民们，并通过你们向全德意志人民致热烈的敬意。
    德意志民主共和国和中华人民共和国是在一九四九年诞生的两个兄弟国家。德意志民主共和国成立以来，在政治上、经济上、文化上都获得了巨大的成就。作为德国首都的柏林，在德意志民主共和国成立以来的几年中，就出现了像斯大林大街上这样庄严美丽的建筑。这种建筑不仅标志着德国人民自觉劳动的成果，而且也象征着整个德国的伟大前途。由于德意志民主共和国在政治上和经济上日益巩固起来，它现在已经成为争取整个德国和平统一的一个具有决定意义的堡垒，并从而保卫欧洲的和平。
    大家知道，五个月以前，就在德国首都柏林，举行了四国外长会议。作为柏林会议的结果，在本年四月间召开了讨论和平解决朝鲜问题和恢复印度支那和平问题的日内瓦会议。朝鲜问题虽然由于一种人为的阻挠没有获得应有的协议，但是，它并没有从议程上去掉，仍需要我们继续努力。就恢复印度支那和平问题来说，它却终于克服了种种困难，不仅达成了在印度支那停止敌对行动的协议，将和平带给印度支那人民和法国人民，而且达成了解决政治问题的原则协议。日内瓦会议关于恢复印度支那和平问题各种协议的达成，证明和平又一次战胜了战争。它并且促使目前的国际紧张局势进一步趋于缓和。不管今后有多少障碍需要我们排除，这种形势对于解决德国问题不能不发生巨大的影响。
    毫无疑义，和平统一问题现在已成为与每一个德国人的切身利益有关的重大问题。这个问题主要地应该由德国人民自己来解决。为了保障德国人民解决他们自己的民族问题的权利，苏联政府外交部部长莫洛托夫同志曾经在柏林会议上建议德意志民主共和国政府和西德政府应该参与关于解决德国问题的讨论，并应该就有关德国和平统一问题进行协商。这是一个公平合理的原则。我们认为，根据讨论恢复印度支那和平问题的经验，在今天这种原则是不应该再被拒绝了。
    中国人民关心亚洲的和平，也关心欧洲的和平。为了维护亚洲的和平，我们主张亚洲国家之间应该进行协商，为了维护欧洲的和平，我们希望欧洲国家之间应该首先就保障欧洲和平和安全问题进行协商。欧洲和平的巩固有赖于德国问题的解决。我们认为，如果各有关国家都具有和平诚意，德国问题是可以经过协商获得解决的。
    但是，有一些人还坚持不愿使德国的和平统一问题得到解决，这些人想尽可能地保持世界的紧张局势，醉心于所谓实力政策，企图在亚洲和欧洲不断策动组织对立的军事集团，以便从中取利。然而除掉这些人以外，欧洲人民、亚洲人民以及全世界人民所希望的不是分裂和对立，而是不同社会制度的国家的和平共处。
    事实证明，不同社会制度的国家是可以和平共处的。今天，世界上赞成和平共处的国家是愈来愈多了，主张分裂和对立的人是愈来愈孤立了。
    在这里，我还不能不提到德意志民主共和国和中华人民共和国的友好关系。德中两大民族的友谊是深厚的。从一九四九年以来，德意志民主共和国和中华人民共和国在新的基础上开始了合作。德中两国合作的前途，无论就经济贸易来说，就文化交流来说，都是光明的。同时，我深信，德国的和平统一对于促进德中两国的经济贸易和文化交流的发展将是有帮助的。
    德意志人民是伟大的人民。德意志人民在科学上、文化上和艺术上的成就都是辉煌的。德意志的工业生产和技术水平都是世界闻名的。
    德意志人民今天为德国的和平统一而进行的努力不懈的奋斗决不是孤立的，是得到全世界爱好和平的人民的支持的。我深信，德意志人民要求和平统一德国的愿望是一定会实现的。和平的、统一的、独立的、民主的德国将会在和平的国际大家庭里发挥它的巨大的作用。
    和平的、统一的、独立的、民主的德国将会在工业生产和科学技术上为和平世界作出有益的贡献，并为世界人民带来幸福。亲爱的同志们和朋友们，让我们高呼：德意志的和平统一和民族独立万岁！德意志民主共和国万岁！威廉·皮克总统万岁！中德两国人民的友谊万岁！以苏联为首的和平民主力量万岁！
