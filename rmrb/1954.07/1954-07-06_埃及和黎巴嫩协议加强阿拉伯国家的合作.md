(Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, July 5) According to TASS, the five-day negotiations between Egyptian Minister of National Guidance, Salah Salem, and the Lebanese government in Beirut concluded on July 2.

    Newspapers pointed out that Salah Salem's trip to the Lebanese capital was to counter the intensified attempts by the United States and Britain in recent times to pull Lebanon and Syria into the Turkish-Pakistani Pact.
    The weekly "Today's News" wrote that Salem and the Lebanese government discussed the issue of the Anglo-Egyptian conflict and the measures that must be taken "to counter the policies of Western countries that are based on mutual destruction among Arab countries."
    According to newspapers, Salem suggested to Lebanese President Camille Chamoun that Egypt and Lebanon conclude an agreement to jointly reject any proposals from Western countries regarding participation in a Middle East bloc "until all disputes between Arab countries and Western countries are resolved."
    The communique issued after the negotiations stated, "Both sides reached full agreement on the need to take effective actions to strengthen the current relations between Arab countries, their political unity, and close cooperation in all aspects in order to solve the problems of these countries and realize their national demands."
    Newspapers said that the actual result of the negotiations was that both sides agreed to convene a meeting of national leaders of Arab countries in the near future to discuss the issue of cooperation between Arab countries.

    埃及和黎巴嫩协议加强阿拉伯国家的合作
    【新华社五日讯】据塔斯社贝鲁特三日讯：埃及国家指导部部长赛拉·萨勒姆和黎巴嫩政府在贝鲁特举行的历时五天的谈判在七月二日结束。
    报纸指出，赛拉·萨勒姆的黎巴嫩首都之行，是为了对抗美英在最近时期加紧把黎巴嫩和叙利亚拉进土巴条约的企图。
    “今日消息”周刊写道，萨勒姆和黎巴嫩政府讨论了关于英埃冲突的问题，并讨论了“为了对抗建筑在阿拉伯国家互相残杀的基础上的西方国家的政策”必须采取什么措施的问题。
    据报纸说，萨勒姆向黎巴嫩总统夏蒙建议：埃及和黎巴嫩缔结一项协定，“在阿拉伯国家和西方国家一切争端得到解决之前”，共同拒绝西方国家关于参加中东集团的任何建议。
    在谈判结束后发表的公报中说，“双方达成充分协议，认为有必要采取有效行动以加强阿拉伯国家之间目前的关系、它们在政策上的联合以及各方面的密切合作，以便解决这些国家的问题，并实现它们的民族要求。”
    报纸说，这次谈判的实际结果是，双方同意在最近时期召开阿拉伯国家的国家领袖会议，以讨论关于阿拉伯国家之间的合作问题。
