    Guatemalan Military Dictatorship
    Suppresses the People Internally and Relies on the United States Externally
    [Xinhua News Agency, July 8th] The Guatemalan military dictatorship is pursuing a policy of suppressing the people internally and relying on U.S. imperialism externally.
    According to news agency reports: The Guatemalan government announced at a press conference on July 5th that since overthrowing the Arbenz democratic government, it has arrested 2,000 progressive individuals and labor party members, and will continue to make arrests in the future. The government also announced the suspension of the implementation of the land reform law and the cessation of confiscating land used by foreign monopoly capital to exploit the local people.
    In terms of diplomacy, the government announced its rejoining of the Organization of Central American States under U.S. control and expressed its support for the Organization of American States, which serves as a tool for the U.S. to invade Latin American countries.

    在外交方面，政府宣布重新加入在美国控制下的中美国家组织，并表示支持充当美国侵略拉丁美洲国家的工具的美洲国家组织。
