Hebei Province Supply and Marketing Cooperatives
Actively Supply Pesticides and Agricultural Machinery

Hebei Province's supply and marketing cooperatives are actively carrying out pesticide and agricultural machinery supply work. According to statistics from nine special districts, more than 420,000 jin of pesticides have now been supplied.

Cadres of the supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions put forward the slogan "Where pests occur, pesticides should be supplied there." Cadres from the Fengchang Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Wu'an County were dispatched with pesticides and agricultural machinery to the countryside, supplying 85 jin of pesticides and four sprayers in one day. The Zhaodian Supply and Marketing Cooperative in the county pre-packaged various pesticides and sold them at stalls, supplying more than 1,100 jin of "666" pesticide powder and more than 110 sprayers in ten days. The director of the Xujiazhuang Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Ji County also specifically helped the local Yin Zhiqiao Agricultural Production Cooperative to control cotton aphids on six mu of land and organized farmers from nearby villages to visit and promote the control of cotton aphids.

    河北省各地供销合作社
    积极供应农药和农业药械
    河北省各地供销合作社积极开展农药、农业药械供应工作。据九个专区的统计，现在已供应了四十二万多斤农药。
    各地供销合作社的干部提出了“虫害发生在那里，农药供应到那里”的口号。武安县冯昌供销合作社抽调干部，带着农药和农业药械下乡，一天供应了八十五斤农药、四架喷雾器。该县赵店供销合作社事先把各种农药包好，摆摊出售，十天供应了一千一百多斤“六六六”药粉、一百一十多架喷雾器。冀县徐家庄供销合作社主任还具体帮助当地的殷志桥农业生产合作社除治棉蚜六亩，并组织附近村庄的农民参观，推动了除治棉蚜工作。
