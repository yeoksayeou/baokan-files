    Defending the Socialist Construction of the Motherland
    Chinese People's Volunteer Army Second-Class Combat Hero Wu Zaiyuan
    After hearing the news of the promulgation of the draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China, I felt unspeakably happy. I think it's so difficult for the Chinese people to have their own constitution!
    My home is in Gaomi, Shandong. From a young age, I worked for the landlords, with only the "obligations" of herding cattle, picking up manure, and cutting grass, but without the right to be fed and clothed properly. There were four brothers and one sister-in-law in my family. We didn't own a single piece of land. My eldest and second elder brothers went to work in a machinery factory in Dalian. Under the rule of the Japanese devils, workers ate moldy cornbread and wore ragged clothes that exposed their skin. They couldn't rest when they were tired, and they would be whipped for the slightest carelessness. My eldest brother was beaten to death by the Japanese devils for resisting. That was the "right" of the Chinese working people in the old society! Later, my second brother couldn't bear this inhuman life any longer, so he ran away to join the Eighth Route Army to avenge my eldest brother! The Japanese devils finally surrendered! My second brother also gloriously sacrificed himself in battle. My sister-in-law had already joined the workforce and was doing everything well. Unfortunately, when Chiang Kai-shek attacked Shandong in 1947, she was captured and killed by the local reactionaries. My third brother also gloriously sacrificed himself in the battle to liberate Jiaozhou, in order to avenge my brothers and sister-in-law and to defeat the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries. For the liberation of the motherland, our family sacrificed three brothers and one sister-in-law. Countless martyrs, like my brothers and sister-in-law, shed their last drop of blood. They bled and sacrificed, but their blood was not shed in vain. Their blood has solidified into today's draft Constitution. On the day the draft Constitution is promulgated, I think of the past and love the present and the future even more. Now, the working people are no longer persecuted by imperialism and the reactionaries, our lives are getting better and better, and our lives are guaranteed. In the future, we will also realize socialism, where lamps don't need oil, fields don't need oxen, and machines are all automated. That life will be even better!
    I am a soldier of the Volunteer Army. I will definitely study hard, improve my military skills, and "defend the achievements of the people's revolution and national construction, and defend the security of the country and the integrity of its territorial sovereignty."

    保卫祖国的社会主义建设
    中国人民志愿军  二级战斗英雄  武在元
    我听到中华人民共和国宪法草案公布的消息后，心里真有说不出的高兴。我觉得中国人民能有自己的宪法多不容易啊！
    我家住在山东高密。从小我就给地主扛活，只有放牛、拾粪、割牛草的“义务”，却没有吃饱穿暖的权利。我兄弟四个，一个大嫂。全家没有一分地，大哥、二哥跑到大连机械厂替人家做工。在日本鬼子的统治下，工人吃的是长毛的棒子面，穿的是见肉的破衣裳，累了捞不到歇，稍怠慢点儿就要吃皮鞭。我大哥因为进行了反抗，被日本鬼子活活打死了。这就是中国劳动人民在旧社会的“权利”！后来我二哥实在不能忍受这种非人的生活，他就跑去参加了八路军，为大哥报仇！日本鬼子终于投降了！我二哥也在战斗中光荣牺牲了。我大嫂早已参加了工作，样样不落人后。不幸，一九四七年蒋介石进攻山东时，她又被还乡团抓去打死了。我三哥为了替哥哥和嫂嫂报仇，为了打垮蒋介石反动派，也在解放胶州战斗中光荣牺牲了。为了祖国的解放，我们一家献出了三个哥哥，一个嫂嫂。无数先烈也像我哥哥嫂嫂一样，流尽了最后一滴血。他们流血牺牲了，但是他们的血没有白流。他们的鲜血凝结成了今天这部宪法草案。在宪法草案公布的今天，我想起了过去，更热爱今天和明天。现在，劳动人民再也不受帝国主义、反动派的迫害，日子一天比一天强，生活得到了保障。往后还要实现社会主义，点灯不用油，耕田不用牛，机器都是自动化，那日子还要更美满哩！
    我是一个志愿军的战士。我一定努力学习，提高军事技术，来“保卫人民革命和国家建设的成果，保卫国家的安全和领土主权的完整”。
