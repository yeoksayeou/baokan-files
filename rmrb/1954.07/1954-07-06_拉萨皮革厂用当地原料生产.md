Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 5th: The Lhasa Leather Factory, affiliated with the Tibet Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, is using leather and fur raw materials produced in Tibet to manufacture more than twenty kinds of inexpensive and high-quality products such as leather shoes, leather mattresses, leather overcoats, felt, and woolen yarn. The felt made from Tibetan wool has the advantages of being moisture-proof, warm, and lightweight, making it suitable for the special climate of the plateau. Leather shoe soles and various leather goods made of yak hide are durable and about one-third cheaper than those transported from the interior. In February of this year, the leather factory switched to using locally produced raw materials, reducing the cost of the tanning process by 40%, and the tanned sheepskin is also exceptionally smooth and soft. In the past six months, the leather factory has tanned more than 15,000 various cattle and sheep skins produced in Tibet, and has also manufactured a large number of leather goods and daily necessities used on mules, horses, and carts to supply the needs of the troops constructing the Kangzang Highway.

    拉萨皮革厂用当地原料生产
    【新华社拉萨五日电】中国人民解放军西藏军区所属拉萨皮革工厂，采用西藏出产的皮毛原料，制造出皮鞋、皮褥、皮袄、毛毡、毛线等二十多种成本低廉、质地优良的产品。用西藏出产的羊毛制成的毡子，具有防潮保暖和轻便的优点，适合高原的特殊气候。用牦牛皮制成的皮鞋底和各种皮件，经久耐用，比从内地运去的在价格上要便宜三分之一左右。今年二月，皮革工厂改用本地出产的原料，使鞣皮过程中的成本降低百分之四十，鞣出的羊皮也异常光滑柔软。半年来，皮革工厂共鞣制了西藏出产的各种牛羊皮一万五千多张，还制造了大批骡马、大车上所用的皮件以及生活用品，供给修筑康藏公路部队的需要。
