Xinhua News Agency, Prague, July 1st: A Chinese art exhibition opened in Prague on June 29th.

Those attending the opening ceremony included Czechoslovakian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Culture Kopecky, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Simovic, and Li Qingquan, Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the Chinese Embassy in Czechoslovakia. Representatives of the Soviet Union and other People's Democratic countries' embassies in Czechoslovakia were also invited to attend the ceremony.

Czechoslovakian Deputy Minister of Culture Ciferni said in his speech at the ceremony that a historical understanding of Chinese culture is important for understanding China's revolutionary transformation and the enormous global significance of these transformations. The exhibition demonstrates the creations made by the Chinese people in the past under difficult conditions and enables people to imagine all that they will create in their new, free, and happy lives.

Fr. Novotny, Director of the Czechoslovakian National Art Gallery, who visited our country last year, said that the art of all Chinese ethnic groups grows from the people, and therefore it can last forever. Understanding it will help the creation of Czechoslovakian artists.

The exhibits on display include various Chinese artworks from 1300 BC to the present. These include paintings, sculptures, embroidery, porcelain, pottery, silverware, jade, cloisonné enamel, and photographs.

    中国艺术展览会在布拉格举行开幕典礼
    【新华社布拉格一日电】中国艺术展览会六月二十九日在布拉格开幕。
    参加开幕典礼的有捷克斯洛伐克共和国副总理兼文化部部长柯别茨基、外交部副部长西莫维茨和我国驻捷大使馆临时代办李清泉等。苏联及其他人民民主国家驻捷使馆代表也应邀参加了典礼。
    捷克斯洛伐克文化部副部长契弗尔尼在典礼上致词说，对中国文化做一历史的了解，对于了解中国的革命转变和这些转变所具有的巨大世界重要意义是很重要的。展览会表明中国人民过去在困难条件下所作的创造，并且使人能够想像出他们在新的自由幸福生活中将创造出的一切。
    去年曾到我国访问的捷克斯洛伐克国家美术馆馆长弗·诺沃提尼说，中国各民族的艺术是从人民中生长起来的，因此它可以永存不灭。了解它就有助于捷克斯洛伐克艺术工作者的创作。
