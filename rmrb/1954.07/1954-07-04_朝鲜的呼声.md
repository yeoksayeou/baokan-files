The Call of Korea
Hong Chunzhe (Korea)
Editor's Note: The Geneva Conference's discussion on the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue was sabotaged by the United States. However, the issue of Korea's peaceful independence and unification remains on the agenda of international affairs, awaiting a rational solution. This is something the American aggressors cannot erase or destroy. This poem by Korean poet Hong Chunzhe expresses the strong desire of the Korean people for peace, independence, and unification.

　　Here, on the quiet banks of the Daedong River, nestled among the fragrant poplar groves draped in greenery, stands a comfortable white house, the newly built schoolhouse of the orphanage. In the spacious rooms where the May sunshine and wind freely enter, many rosy, childlike faces ripple like flowers in a garden... Eyes like glittering morning stars gaze intently in one direction—towards a little girl standing at the blackboard, writing. Her small hand, holding the white chalk, sways like a wild rose by the riverbank, and with each movement of her tiny fingertip, lovely characters bloom like flower petals: "Long live peaceful unification and independence!" As if a gust of wind swept across a summer prairie, the entire room instantly stirs, and everyone reads aloud in a strong voice, "Long live peaceful unification and independence!"

　　Suddenly, a boy in the back row raises his hand and strides to the front of the blackboard. Before long... his sturdy fist, gripping the chalk, scribbles out several large characters like a hailstorm: "Yankee Imperialists, get out of Korea!" In an instant, fists rise like a forest, and the entire room resounds with a powerful voice, "Yankee Imperialists, get out of Korea!"

　　"Long live peaceful unification and independence!" These are not words taught by the teacher, nor phrases learned from books; these are words that all the children present have learned in the flames, with blood and tears. Every character is soaked with: the sorrow of losing a mother's embrace, the deep pain of a father's slaughter, and the blood-soaked hatred for the burning of their hometown villages. These are words of anger, words of hope. The young children understand that wherever the claws of the United States reach, flames engulf the streets and villages, and mothers and children bleed... As long as the shadows of the United States and its running dog, the traitor Syngman Rhee, are not eliminated, there will be no laughter of children or happiness of mothers in the southern land... Therefore, the children raise their fists again and again, shouting loudly, "Yankee Imperialists, get out of Korea!"

　　"Long live peaceful unification and independence!" This is the phrase hidden in the hearts of the heroes who charged towards steel tanks with their five-foot bodies and shattered alongside them in that instant, who blocked the fierce muzzles spitting flames with their chests in that instant! On the construction sites where cranes move house-sized iron blocks back and forth in a race, on the solemn battlefield of reconstruction where towering buildings rise one after another, these are the words burning like torches in the hearts of the people who are creating miracles today! In the suffering land where the morning is uncertain and tomorrow is unpredictable—the unfortunate southern half of the motherland—in the many bleeding streets and groaning villages, these are the words hidden in the hearts of the unyielding and brave brothers, as immovable as mountains! This is the voice of Korea, shouted with one voice by everyone raising their heads in every corner of the three thousand li from north to south, raising their fists! "Yankee Imperialists, get out of Korea!"

　　"Long live peaceful unification and independence!" Today, this resounding call crosses layers of latitude, thousands of mountains and rivers, and echoes on the distant Geneva podium, like the first thunder of spring sounding on the May earth, shaking the hearts of hundreds of millions of people. "Yankee Imperialists, get out of Korea!"

　　"Long live peaceful unification and independence!" This is the burning desire deeply hidden in the hearts of the Korean people today! This is the call for peace and happiness shouted aloud by the whole world today! Therefore, this is an iron declaration that must be realized, must be achieved! "Yankee Imperialists, get out of Korea!"

　　"Long live peaceful unification and independence!"

    朝鲜的呼声
    朝鲜　洪淳哲
    编者按：日内瓦会议关于和平解决朝鲜问题的讨论被美国破坏了，但是朝鲜的和平独立和统一问题依然留在国际事务的日程上等待着合理的解决，这是美国侵略者无法抹杀和破坏的。朝鲜诗人洪淳哲这首诗正表现了朝鲜人民要求和平、要求独立、要求统一的坚强的愿望。这儿是幽静的大同江边，在遮满绿荫的芳香的白杨丛里，有座安适的白色的房子，是新盖成的爱育院的校舍。在那五月的阳光和风自由进出的宽敞的房间，许多红红的稚气的脸蛋动荡的像花圃的花朵一般……像晶莹闪烁的晨星般的眼睛，都向着一个地方凝视——那儿站着一个小姑娘她正在黑板上写字。拿着白粉笔的小手，好像江边的野玫瑰一样摇摆，随着那小小的指尖的移动，可爱的字就像花瓣一个个地开。——和平的统一和独立万岁！仿佛一阵风吹过夏天的草原，立刻骚动了整个的房间，全体用强有力的声音一起朗读，——和平的统一和独立万岁！这时，后排的一个男孩子猛然举手站起来，大步地走到黑板前面。没多一会……他那结实的拳头捏着的粉笔头，就像倾下冰雹般挥出几个粗大的字，——美帝国主义，滚出朝鲜去！倾刻间拳头举成树林，整个房间响彻强烈的声音，——美帝国主义，滚出朝鲜去！
    和平的统一和独立万岁！这绝不是老师教他们的话，也不是从书本上学来的词句，这是在座的全体孩子们在火焰里用血泪学会的言语。每个字都浸透着：失去慈母的怀抱的悲哀，爸爸被屠杀的沉痛，故乡的村舍全部烧尽的血海深仇；这是愤怒的话，希望的话。年幼的孩子们都明白——美国的魔爪所伸到的地方，那里的街头和村庄就卷起火焰，那里的母亲和孩子就流出鲜血……美国和它的走狗李承晚卖国贼们，他们的黑影一天不消灭，南方的国土上就不会有孩子们的笑声，也不会有母亲们的幸福……因此，孩子们一次又一次地举起拳头声声高喊，——美帝国主义，滚出朝鲜去！
    和平的统一和独立万岁！当以五尺之躯冲向钢铁的坦克和它一块儿粉碎的那一刹那，当以胸口去堵住那喷出火焰的凶恶枪口的一刹那，这是在勇士们的胸中藏着的话！在起重机咬着房屋般的大铁块来回移动的竞赛的工地上，在那高楼大厦一个接一个冲天站起来的庄严的恢复建设的战场，这是今天也创造出奇迹的人们他们的胸中像火炬般燃烧的话！在那朝不保夕今天难测明天的悲惨受难的国土——祖国的不幸的南半部，许多流血的街头，呻吟的村庄，这是那些不屈服的勇敢的兄弟们他们的胸中藏着的像山岳般不可动摇的话！这是南北三千里，每个角落，一切昂起头来的人们，举起双拳，用一个声音高喊的朝鲜的声音！——美帝国主义，滚出朝鲜去！
    和平的统一和独立万岁！今天这宏亮的呼声越过层层纬度，千山万水，在遥远的日内瓦的讲坛上，好像五月的大地响起第一声春雷，震动了亿万人的心脏。——美帝国主义，滚出朝鲜去！
    和平的统一和独立万岁！这是今天朝鲜人民的胸中深藏的燃烧着的愿望！这是今天全世界高声喊出的和平和幸福的呼声！因此，这是一定要实现必须要实现的钢铁的宣言！——美帝国主义，滚出朝鲜去！
    和平的统一和独立万岁！
