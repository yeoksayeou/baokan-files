    The State-Owned Tangshan Qixin Porcelain Factory Should Resume Production of Chemical Instruments

    A reader writes: The various porcelain chemical instruments (such as crucibles, evaporating dishes, combustion boats, and combustion tubes) produced by the State-Owned Tangshan Qixin Porcelain Factory in the past were of high quality and low price, and the testing institutions of many industrial departments, scientific research institutions, factories, mines, and schools across the country were happy to use them.

      In 1953, the country's first Five-Year Plan began. With the development of the country's industrial construction, the testing institutions of various units have expanded and strengthened accordingly, thus requiring a larger amount of chemical instruments. However, the factory stopped producing these urgently needed chemical instruments in 1953. Before and after the cessation of production, it did not entrust any production units to produce this product on its behalf. As a result, there was a shortage of goods in the market, and some private small factories took the opportunity to vigorously solicit orders for their substandard and non-standard products from all over the country. These products are not resistant to high temperatures and are easily broken during use. The loss of the instrument itself is secondary; the loss of test data and work tasks due to instrument breakage is inestimable.

      According to our understanding, after the Ministry of Geology learned of the factory's cessation of chemical instrument production in 1953, it requested the factory to produce porcelain crucibles in large quantities in 1954 due to the needs of the geological exploration teams under the Ministry of Geology, and guaranteed that all of them would be used. The Iron and Steel Industry Testing Institute of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry, the Coal Mine Administration Bureau of the Central Ministry of Fuel Industry, certain units under the Central Second Ministry of Machinery, and state-owned factories and mines in many regions all had opinions on the factory's cessation of chemical instrument production. However, these opinions did not receive attention from the leadership of the Qixin Porcelain Factory.

    The Qixin Porcelain Factory has the conditions to resume the production of chemical instruments in terms of equipment and technical personnel. It is hoped that the factory will seriously study this issue and quickly resume the production of chemical instruments according to the possible conditions to meet the needs of national construction.

      Editor's note: The situation reflected in the reader's letter is correct. After this newspaper informed the Bureau of Building Materials Industry of the Ministry of Heavy Industry of the reader's opinions, the bureau recently stated in its reply that it is preparing to have the Tangshan Qixin Porcelain Factory resume the production of chemical instruments. It is hoped that they will supervise and help the Tangshan Qixin Porcelain Factory to prepare for the resumption of production and carry out production according to market needs so that testing institutions in various places can obtain sufficient and suitable instruments. If testing institutions in various places need chemical instruments produced by the factory, they should also propose requirements for quantity and specifications as much as possible to help the factory grasp market needs and carry out production in a planned manner.

### 国营唐山启新瓷厂应该恢复化学仪器的生产

专栏：读者来信摘要

    国营唐山启新瓷厂应该恢复化学仪器的生产
    一读者来信：中央重工业部建筑材料工业管理局唐山启新瓷厂以往生产的各种瓷质化学仪器（如坩埚、蒸发皿、燃烧舟和燃烧管等）质量较高，价格低廉，全国很多工业部门、科学研究机关、厂矿、学校等的化验机构都乐意采用。
      一九五三年国家第一个五年计划开始了，随着国家工业建设的发展，各单位化验机构都相应地扩大和加强了，因此需要更大量的化学仪器。但是，该厂在一九五三年却将这项市场急需的化学仪器停止生产了；停止生产前后也没有委托代替生产这项产品的生产单位。于是，市场缺货，某些私营小厂乘机把他们的不合规格和标准的劣货向各地大肆招揽。这种产品不耐高温，在使用过程中容易破裂，仪器本身的损失尚在其次，因仪器破裂而使化验资料和工作任务所受的损失是无法估计的。
      据我们了解，中央地质部在一九五三年知道该厂停止生产化学仪器的消息后，因为地质部所属地质勘探队的需要，曾要求该厂在一九五四年大批生产瓷坩埚，而且保证全部采用。中央重工业部钢铁工业试验所，中央燃料工业部煤矿管理总局，中央第二机械部所属某些单位以及不少地区的国营厂矿对该厂停止生产化学仪器的做法都有意见。但是这些意见都没有得到启新瓷厂领导方面的重视。
    启新瓷厂要恢复化学仪器生产，在设备和技术人员方面都是有条件的。希望该厂认真研究这个问题，根据可能条件迅速恢复化学仪器的生产，以适应国家建设的需要。
      编者按：读者来信反映的情况是正确的。经本报把读者的意见告诉建筑材料工业管理局，该局最近在复信中已提出准备让唐山启新瓷厂恢复化学仪器的生产。希望他们督促并帮助唐山启新瓷厂做好恢复生产的准备工作，根据市场需要情况进行生产，使各地化验机构能够得到充分的、合用的仪器。各地化验机构如果需用该厂所产的化学仪器，也应该尽可能地提出对数量和规格的要求，以帮助该厂掌握市场需要情况，有计划地进行生产。
