Xinhua News Agency, July 20th, London: British Labour MP Bevan criticized the U.S. foreign policy at a miners' rally in Durham on July 17th. Bevan said, "They (the United States) believe they can quarantine an idea, that they can encircle a philosophy, preventing its spread. They think they can defeat the Chinese Revolution and what it stands for with armaments." He pointed out that the U.S.'s hostile attitude towards the People's Republic of China risks repeating "the same mistakes Britain made on the Russian question in 1918-1919."

Xinhua News Agency, July 20th, TASS London, July 19th: According to "Reynolds News," "Within the British Labour and Conservative parties, there is now a widespread desire to find a way for communist and non-communist countries to coexist."

The newspaper concluded, "It should be openly said to the United States that Britain (including its two parties) is determined to continue acting according to its own plans to seek reconciliation between East and West. If Britain passively follows the American policy, which is neither well-considered nor feasible, it will not benefit any country."

    英工党议员比万抨击美国敌视中国的政策
    “雷诺新闻”主张英国实行独立的政策反对追随美国
    【新华社二十日讯】伦敦消息：英国工党议员比万七月十七日在达拉谟一个矿工的集会上抨击美国的外交政策。比万说：“他们（美国）认为可以把一种概念像检疫那样封锁起来，可以对一种哲学进行包围，防止这种概念的蔓延。他们认为可以用军备来击败中国革命，和它所主张的东西。”他指出，美国对中华人民共和国所采取的这种敌视态度有犯英国“在一九一八—一九一九年在对俄国问题上所犯的同样错误的危险”。
    【新华社二十日讯】塔斯社伦敦十九日讯：据“雷诺新闻”的消息说：“在英国工党和保守党内部，现在普遍存在着设法使共产主义国家和非共产主义国家共处的愿望。”
    报纸最后说：“应该公开向美国说，英国（包括它的两个党）坚决地要继续按照自己的打算去做，以求得东西方之间的和解。如果英国消极地追随着那考虑得既不正确也不可能实现的美国政策走，对任何一个国家都是没有一点点好处的。”
