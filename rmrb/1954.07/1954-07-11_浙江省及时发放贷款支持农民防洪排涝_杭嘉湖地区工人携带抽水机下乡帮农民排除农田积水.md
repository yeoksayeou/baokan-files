    Zhejiang Province Promptly Issues Loans to Support Farmers in Flood Prevention and Drainage
    Workers in the Hangzhou-Jiaxing-Huzhou Area Carry Water Pumps to the Countryside to Help Farmers Drain Waterlogged Farmland

    In May and June of this year, People's Banks in various parts of Zhejiang Province promptly issued 36.5 billion yuan in agricultural loans to support farmers in areas of the province that experienced waterlogging due to excessive rainfall, for flood prevention and drainage. Of this loan amount, approximately 42% or more was used to help farmers in waterlogged areas overcome living difficulties, with the remainder primarily used for purchasing fertilizer, farm tools, seeds, and water conservancy equipment. In May, farmers in Changxing County used over 360 million yuan in loans for emergency rescue and purchasing food rations. After receiving over 80 million yuan in loans for flood prevention equipment, farmers in Wuxing County purchased a large number of wooden stakes and repaired and manufactured many flood prevention tools. Farmers in waterlogged areas of Xiaoshan County used loans to purchase and repair more than 430 waterwheels, enabling timely drainage.

    When issuing loans, People's Banks in various parts of Zhejiang Province mostly dispatched cadres with the funds to the countryside, simplified loan procedures, and ensured that loans were quickly distributed to farmers. In areas of Zhuji County where floodwaters had receded, the People's Bank adopted a blitz approach to issuing loans for replanting rice seedlings, helping farmers catch up with the planting season. Farmers in Paitou Township of this county received loans on the fourth day after the floodwaters receded.
    
    The draining of waterlogged areas in parts of the Hangzhou-Jiaxing-Huzhou Plain in Zhejiang Province has received support from workers. Currently, six to seven hundred skilled workers are operating five hundred water pumps, busily draining waterlogged areas. In the drainage process, workers and farmers are jointly researching, dividing labor, and cooperating, using water pumps in conjunction with a large number of manual waterwheels to drain water in sections. Many workers are installing, managing, and repairing water pumping machines day and night. Workers in Huzhou City rushed to assemble twenty-five water pumping boats to patrol and drain waterlogged areas. Qian Guocheng, a worker from Hangzhou City, and Feng Rujin, a worker from Linghu Town, worked continuously for two days and two nights repairing machines. Many skilled workers are patrolling day and night, helping farmers repair machines. After receiving assistance from the workers and seeing the effectiveness of the water pumps, farmers in the waterlogged areas have increased their confidence in drainage and rescue efforts, and are working together more unitedly to operate waterwheels and drain water. Currently, water has been drained from many paddy fields. Many farmers gratefully expressed to the workers that they must work hard to increase grain production to support national industrial construction.

    In late June of this year, due to excessive rainfall, some paddy fields in the Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou areas became waterlogged. The CCP committees and trade union organizations of many factories in Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Huzhou, and other cities and rural towns urgently studied and organized large numbers of skilled workers to carry water pumping machines to the countryside to help farmers drain waterlogged areas. Many skilled workers enthusiastically signed up to go to the countryside to participate in the drainage efforts.

    浙江省及时发放贷款支持农民防洪排涝
    杭嘉湖地区工人携带抽水机下乡帮农民排除农田积水
    浙江省各地人民银行今年五、六月份及时发放了三百六十五亿元农业贷款，支持省内因雨水过多发生水涝的地区的农民防洪排涝。这笔贷款中，帮助受涝地区农民解决生活困难的约占百分之四十二以上，其余大部分用于添置肥料、农具、种籽和水利设备。长兴县农民五月份把三亿六千多万元贷款用到抢险和购买口粮上。吴兴县农民得到八千多万元防洪设备贷款后，添买了大批木桩，并且修理和制造了很多防洪用具。萧山县受涝地区的农民用贷款买进和修理水车四百三十多部，及时进行了排涝。
    浙江省各地人民银行在发放贷款时，大都抽调干部携款下乡，并简化贷款手续，使贷款迅速发放到农民手中。在诸暨县洪水退落的地区，人民银行采取突击方式发放秧苗补种贷款。帮助农民赶上了种植季节。这个县牌头镇的农民在洪水退落后的第四天，就得到了贷款。

    浙江省杭（州）嘉（兴）湖（州）平原部分地区的排除积水工作得到工人的支援。目前有六七百名技术工人正掌握着五百部抽水机紧张地抽水排涝。工人们在排涝中和农民共同研究、分工合作，由抽水机配合大批人力水车分片排水。很多工人不分日夜地安装、管理和修理抽水机器。湖州市的工人赶装了二十五只抽水机船在涝区巡回排涝。杭州市工人钱国成和菱湖镇工人封如金连续两天两夜在赶修机器。很多技术工人日夜巡回帮助农民检修机器。涝区农民得到工人的帮助和看到抽水机的排水效力后，排涝抢救的信心增强，更加齐心合力地车水排涝。目前很多稻田积水已经排干。很多农民感激地向工人表示一定要努力增产粮食支援国家工业建设。
    今年六月下旬，杭、嘉、湖地区因雨水过多，部分稻田积水成涝。杭州、嘉兴、湖州等城市和乡村集镇很多工厂的中共党委和工会组织就紧急研究和组织大批技术工人携带抽水机器下乡帮助农民排涝，很多技术工人争先报名要求下乡参加排涝。
