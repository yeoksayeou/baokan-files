Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 10th. According to TASS, the Czechoslovak Republic's Ministry of Foreign Affairs delivered a note to the U.S. Embassy in Czechoslovakia on the 7th, protesting the violation of Czechoslovak national borders by a group of U.S. occupation forces stationed in West Germany.

    The note pointed out that at 19:00 on July 4th, seven U.S. occupation forces soldiers stationed in West Germany violated the Czechoslovak Republic's national border, intruding 500 meters into Czechoslovak territory near the village of Pavlov Studenek. They conducted observations there, and one of them took photographs. When the Czechoslovak border guards attempted to detain these illegal intruders, they fled towards the West German border. The border guards captured all the intruders. It was determined that those detained were soldiers from the 816th Artillery Battalion stationed in Wilseck. The leader was Captain Jack Davis.

    Two cameras were found on the intruders. The films taken from the cameras showed that the U.S. soldiers had photographed important targets in the Czechoslovak border area.

    The detained U.S. soldiers confessed that they came to the border by car, which they parked on West German territory. They said that they were well aware that they were crossing a clearly marked border. This confession, as well as the fact that the U.S. soldiers infiltrated Czechoslovak territory, conducted observations, took photographs, and then tried to escape, clearly demonstrates that the U.S. soldiers' intrusion into Czechoslovak territory was not accidental, but for reconnaissance purposes.

    On the instructions of the Government of the Czechoslovak Republic, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czechoslovak Republic lodges the strongest protest against this act of violating the territorial integrity of Czechoslovakia.

    捷克斯洛伐克外交部照会美国
    强烈抗议美国驻西德占领军侵犯国界
    【新华社十日讯】据塔斯社布拉格讯：捷克斯洛伐克共和国外交部七日将照会一份交给美国驻捷大使馆，抗议美国驻西德的一批占领军侵犯捷克斯洛伐克国界。
    照会指出，七月四日十九时有七名美国驻西德占领军军人侵犯了捷克斯洛伐克共和国国界，由帕夫卢夫斯图德湼克村附近侵入捷克斯洛伐克国境五百公尺。他们在这里进行观测，其中一人还拍摄照片。当捷边防军打算扣留这群非法入侵者时，他们曾向西德边境逃跑。边防军抓住了所有的入侵者。经查明，被扣留者是驻扎在维尔塞克的第八百一十六炮兵部队的军人。为首的是杰克·戴维斯上尉。
    在入侵者身上搜到了两个照相机。从照相机中取出的软片上可以看出美国军人所拍摄的是捷边境地区的重要目标。
    被扣留的美国军人供认，他们是乘汽车到边界来的，他们将汽车停在西德的领土上。他们说，他们明明知道自己越过了有很清楚标记的边界。这种供认以及美国军人潜入捷克斯洛伐克领土、进行观测、拍摄照片然后设法逃走的事实清楚地说明，美国军人侵入捷克斯洛伐克领土并不是误入而是为了进行侦察。
    捷克斯洛伐克共和国外交部奉捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府的指示，对于侵犯捷克斯洛伐克领土完整的行为提出最强烈的抗议。
