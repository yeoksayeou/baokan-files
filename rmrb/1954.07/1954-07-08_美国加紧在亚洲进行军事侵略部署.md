    Xinhua News Agency, July 7th: At a time when Asian people are widely demanding the establishment of peace and security in Asia, the US authorities are stepping up the expansion of puppet troops and organizing aggressive blocs in Asia to prepare for the United States to launch new military aggression.
    Van Fleet, the former commander of the US Eighth Army in Korea, who was ordered to the Far East to deploy aggressive activities, arrived in Manila from Hong Kong on July 6 after a series of activities in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. According to Western news agencies, after arriving in Manila, Van Fleet will hold secret talks with senior Philippine military and political leaders and US military leaders stationed in the Philippines to discuss the US military deployment in the Far East, especially the expansion of the Philippine puppet army and the expansion of Philippine military bases. After being ordered to the Far East again on June 11 to conduct military preparations, Van Fleet has been carrying out busy conspiratorial activities in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. He held a series of secret talks with Yoshida, Syngman Rhee, and Chiang Kai-shek, as well as US military leaders in the Far East, to study and formulate aggressive plans in various aspects, such as increasing US military "aid" to these puppets, expanding puppet troops, expanding military bases, and organizing military aggression blocs. He also inspected and investigated the military institutions, military bases, and arms production of these puppets, as well as the training and weapons and equipment of the puppet troops. The US ruling group is hostile to the Chinese people, and he is also trying to conclude a so-called bilateral common security agreement with the Chiang Kai-shek gang. According to foreign news agencies, Van Fleet clamored in Taiwan that "there should be a bilateral common security treaty between the United States and China." Such conspiracies by Van Fleet and others are a blatant manifestation of trying to create war.
    Van Fleet was first ordered by US President Eisenhower at the end of April to go to the Far East to deploy military aggression. According to Western news agencies, Van Fleet's mission to the Far East is to expand and strengthen the puppet troops of Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and the Philippines; to plan the large-scale resumption of Japanese arms industry production as the "arsenal" for the United States to expand puppet troops and carry out aggressive activities in Asia; to organize a Northeast Asian military aggression bloc including Japan, South Korea, the Ryukyu Islands, and Taiwan, as the "northern pillar" of the Southeast Asian military aggression bloc that the United States is stepping up to organize. After Van Fleet led a group of military experts to the Far East, he traveled back and forth between Tokyo, Seoul, and Taiwan to carry out conspiratorial activities. Before the US-UK-France-Australia-New Zealand military conference was held in early June, Van Fleet was ordered to rush back to Washington to report to the US authorities on the results of his activities in the Far East. He held secret talks with US President Eisenhower, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Radford, and members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Military Committee. According to US newspapers, Van Fleet suggested at these meetings that the United States should step up preparations to expand the Indochina war, and also suggested vigorously expanding and training Asian puppet troops and using them to spearhead new military adventures launched by the United States. After listening to and studying Van Fleet's report, Eisenhower dispatched him again in mid-June to lead a group of experts in training puppet troops to the Far East for thirty to sixty days of activities, stepping up efforts to pave the way for the United States to launch new aggression.
    It is quite obvious that this conspiracy of the United States is hostile to the wishes of all Asian people. However, after the Prime Ministers of China and India and the Prime Ministers of China and Burma issued joint statements respectively, the Asian people are striving to safeguard peace and security in Asia with great courage and confidence. If the United States dares to launch new adventures, it will inevitably become more isolated and will inevitably suffer even more disastrous defeats.

### 美国加紧在亚洲进行军事侵略部署

    美国加紧在亚洲进行军事侵略部署
    【新华社七日讯】正当亚洲人民广泛要求建立亚洲的和平和安全的时候，美国当局却在亚洲加紧扩充傀儡军队、组织侵略集团，为美国发动新的军事侵略进行准备。
    奉命到远东来部署侵略活动的前侵朝美军第八军军长范佛里特在日本、南朝鲜、台湾进行一系列的活动后，已在七月六日从香港到达马尼拉。据西方通讯社报道，范佛里特到达马尼拉后，将与菲律宾高级军政首脑和驻菲律宾美军首脑举行秘密会谈，讨论美国在远东的军事部署问题，特别是扩充菲律宾傀儡军队、扩大菲律宾军事基地的问题。范佛里特在六月十一日再次奉命到远东来进行军事准备以后，已在日本、南朝鲜和台湾进行了忙忙碌碌的阴谋活动。他同吉田、李承晚和蒋介石以及远东美军首脑举行了一系列的秘密会谈，研究和拟订增加美国对这些傀儡的军事“援助”、扩充傀儡军队、扩建军事基地、组织军事侵略集团等各方面的侵略计划，并且视察和调查了这些傀儡的军事机构、军事基地、军火生产，以及傀儡军队的训练和武器装备情况。美国统治集团与中国人民为敌，他还正在企图和蒋介石匪帮缔结所谓共同安全双边协定。据外电，范佛里特在台湾叫嚣，“认为中美之间应有一项共同安全双边条约”。范佛里特等的这种阴谋，完全是力图制造战争的露骨表现。
    范佛里特是在四月底奉美国总统艾森豪威尔的命令首次到远东来进行军事侵略部署的。据西方通讯社透露，范佛里特到远东来的任务就是扩充和加强日本、南朝鲜、台湾、菲律宾的傀儡军队；策划恢复日本军火工业的大规模生产，作为美国在亚洲扩充傀儡军队和进行侵略活动的“兵工厂”；组织一个包括日本、南朝鲜、琉球群岛、台湾等在内的东北亚军事侵略集团，作为美国正在加紧组织的东南亚军事侵略集团的“北部支柱”。范佛里特率领一批军事专家来到远东后，在东京、汉城、台湾之间来来去去进行阴谋活动。在美、英、法、澳、新五国军事会议六月初召开的前夕，范佛里特又奉命急急忙忙赶回华盛顿，向美国当局报告他在远东进行活动的结果。他同美国总统艾森豪威尔、参谋长联席会议主席雷德福以及参议院外交委员会和军事委员会的委员分别进行了秘密会谈。据美国报纸透露，范佛里特在这些会议中向他们建议，美国应该加紧进行准备扩大印度支那战争，并且建议，大力扩充和训练亚洲傀儡军队，利用他们来为美国发动的新的军事冒险打头阵。艾森豪威尔在听取和研究范佛里特的报告以后，又派遣他在六月中旬率领一批训练伪军的专家再次到远东来进行三十天到六十天的活动，加紧为美国发动新的侵略铺平道路。
    十分明显，美国的这个阴谋是和全亚洲人民的愿望为敌的。但是，亚洲人民在中印两国总理和中缅两国总理分别发表了联合声明以后，正满怀着高度的勇气和信心为保障亚洲的和平和安全而努力。美国如果敢于发动新的冒险，他必然更加孤立，必然遭到更加惨重的失败。
