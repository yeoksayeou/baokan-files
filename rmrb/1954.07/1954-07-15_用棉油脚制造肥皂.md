    Manufacturing Soap with Cottonseed Oil Foots
    The state-owned China Soap Company has successfully manufactured soap using cottonseed oil foots, saving 100,000 jin of edible oil each month.

    Cottonseed oil foots are the residue left over from oil factories refining cottonseed oil. They contain many impurities and are dark in color. In the past, they were considered useless, and some factories buried them in the ground. In order to utilize this waste material for manufacturing soap, technicians such as Shen Jichuan conducted numerous experiments and finally succeeded. The quality of this soap is the same as that produced using ordinary oils.

    From mid-May, when the factory began using cottonseed oil foots for production, to early July, a total of 4,500 cases of soap were produced, enough to supply 270,000 people for one month. In the past, 90% of the raw materials used were linseed oil. This raw material is currently in short supply. After research by the factory's employees, tung oil was used to replace linseed oil, overcoming the difficulty of raw material shortage, while maintaining quality and reducing costs.

    用棉油脚制造肥皂
    国营中国肥皂公司试用棉油脚制造肥皂成功，每月可节约食用油脂十万斤。
    棉油脚是油脂厂炼棉籽油剩下来的，杂质很多，颜色深黑，过去认为没有用处，有些厂把它埋在地里。为利用这种废料制造肥皂，技术人员沈济川等经过多次试验终告成功。这种肥皂的品质与用普通油脂生产的一样。
    该厂自五月中旬利用棉油脚投入生产到七月初，共生产肥皂四千五百箱，可供给二十七万人使用一个月。过去所用的原料，有百分之九十是亚麻仁油。这种原料目前较为缺乏。经该厂职工研究，用梓油来代替亚麻仁油，克服了原料缺乏的困难，并且保持了质量，成本也低廉。
