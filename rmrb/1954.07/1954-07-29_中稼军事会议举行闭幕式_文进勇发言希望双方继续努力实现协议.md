    Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam: The full text of the speech by General Van Tien Dung, chief representative of the General Command Delegation of the Vietnam People's Army, at the closing ceremony of the Sino-Vietnamese local military conference on July 27th is as follows:
    Distinguished Representatives,
    The Sino-Vietnamese local military conference opened while the sound of gunfire still echoed throughout the country.
    Today, the conference is closing, and the sound of gunfire in North Vietnam has ceased. We believe that in the near future, the sound of gunfire will completely cease on the territories of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia.
    The restoration of peace in Indochina brings joy to the people of Indochina, the people of France, and peace-loving people around the world.
    During the twenty-three days of the conference, concrete results were achieved through the efforts and understanding of the General Command Delegations of both sides.
    The local military conference implemented the Geneva Conference agreements, properly resolved the issue of repatriation of sick and wounded prisoners of war, and reached an agreement on improving the living conditions of prisoners of war.
    The conference studied and stipulated the necessary measures to achieve a ceasefire throughout the territory of Vietnam.
    From the above results, we can say that the local military conference was successful and laid a good foundation for the future Joint Commission.
    The results of the Geneva Conference and the local military conference prove that every problem can be solved as long as both sides have a sincere desire for peace.
    Distinguished Representatives,
    Under the wise leadership of President Ho Chi Minh, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and the Vietnam Workers' Party, the Vietnamese people, like the people of Laos and Cambodia, have endured great hardships and waged unremitting and heroic struggles for peace, unification, independence, and democracy. Today, the Geneva Conference has achieved concrete results, and peace has begun to be restored. We will continue to strive and overcome all obstacles that may hinder the implementation of the nine-nation agreement at the Geneva Conference, so that peace in Indochina can be consolidated and lasting, and the unification and independence of our motherland can be realized.
    This is the urgent and legitimate aspiration of the Vietnamese people, as well as the Lao and Cambodian people; similarly, it is the sincere desire of the French people, the people of Southeast Asia, and peace-loving people around the world.
    During the twenty-three days of the military conference, we demonstrated sincerity and effort. We will continue to work hard to implement all the agreements we have reached.
    We hope that the General Command of the French Union Forces in Indochina, like its representatives here, will make greater efforts to ensure that all agreements reached can be fully implemented and to create favorable conditions for the future implementation of the Geneva Armistice Agreement.

    【新华社北越讯】从七月四日开始的中稼当地军事会议已于七月二十七日顺利地结束，在二十七日下午三时举行了闭幕式。印度支那法兰西联邦部队总司令部代表团首席代表兰努约上校和越南人民军总司令部代表团首席代表文进勇将军在会上先后发言。他们都对会议的顺利进行和良好的成就感到欣慰，并表示将为停战协定条款的切实执行而继续努力（文进勇发言另发）。兰努约上校在讲话中还特别强调越南人民军总司令部代表团对会议的成功作出了重大努力，并向文进勇将军及其代表团全体人员表示感谢。
    接着，双方的秘书分别用越文和法文向记者们宣读了中稼军事会议闭幕会议的联合公报。三时半，闭幕式结束。双方首席代表起立握手后，分别率领双方代表团人员退出会场。
    【新华社北越讯】越南人民军总司令部代表团首席代表文进勇将军七月二十七日在中稼当地军事会议闭幕式上的发言全文如下：
    各位代表：
    中稼当地军事会议是在全国各地枪炮声还响着的时候开幕的。
    今天，会议闭幕，北越的枪炮声停止了。我们相信：不久的将来，枪炮声将在越南、老挝、柬埔寨三国领土上完全停止。
    和平在印度支那的恢复，给印度支那人民、法国人民和世界爱好和平的人民带来了欢乐。
    会议在二十三天的工作中，由于双方总司令部代表团的努力和谅解，获得了具体的结果。
    当地军事会议执行日内瓦会议的协议，妥善地解决了遣返病伤战俘的问题，并已就改善战俘生活等问题获致协议。
    会议研究并规定了在全越南领土上实现停火的必要的办法。
    从上述的结果来看，我们可以说：当地军事会议是成功的，并为未来的联合委员会打下良好的基础。
    日内瓦会议和当地军事会议的结果证明：只要双方都有和平的诚意，每个问题都是可以解决的。
    诸位代表：
    越南人民在胡志明主席、越南民主共和国政府和越南劳动党的英明领导下，像老挝、柬埔寨人民一样，备尝艰苦，为和平、统一、独立、民主而进行了不懈的和英勇的斗争。今天，日内瓦会议已获得了具体的结果，和平已开始恢复。我们将不断地奋斗，克服各种足以阻碍实现日内瓦会议上九国协议的障碍，使印度支那的和平得到巩固和持久，实现我们祖国的统一和独立。
    这是越南人民以及老挝和柬埔寨人民的迫切的和正当的愿望；同样，这也是法国人民、东南亚人民和世界爱好和平的人民的热诚的愿望。
    在二十三天的军事会议中，我们表现出了真诚和努力。我们将继续努力以实现双方已达成的一切协议。
    我们希望印度支那法兰西联邦部队总司令部像它在这里的代表那样，作出更大的努力，使已达成的一切协议均能完全实现，并为将来对日内瓦的停战协定的履行创造有利的条件。
