Xinhua News Agency, July 9th: The national petroleum industry has exceeded the national production plan for the first half of this year. The total industrial output value fulfilled 115.7% of the plan. The completion of the plan for four major products is as follows: crude oil completed 107.6%, gasoline completed 108.9%, kerosene completed 129.5%, and diesel completed 121.8%. Thirteen major products of the Northeast Petroleum Factory No. 1 had already completed the production plan for the first half of this year by June 23. Compared with the same period last year, the production level in the first half of this year showed: total industrial output value exceeded more than 50% of the same period last year; the lowest of the four major products exceeded 28.3%; and the highest exceeded 96.9%.

In the first half of this year, the petroleum industry's factories and mines universally carried out rationalization proposals. The implementation of this work has not only created a large amount of wealth for the country but has also further ensured the over-fulfillment of the production plan for the first half of this year. For example, Hai Deyan, a technician at Northeast Petroleum Factory No. 1, successfully researched mixing some No. 2 light oil with a low freezing point directly with cold-pressed oil without processing, reducing the dewaxing process, which can produce more light oil and create more than 35 billion yuan of wealth for the country each year. The wax workshop improved equipment and increased processing volume, creating wealth of more than 18 billion yuan for the country. In the past, the Longchang Carbon Black Plant lost more than 50,000 kilograms of carbon black from the workshop skylights due to equipment limitations for several years since its establishment. After the technical inspection section's furnace method trial group proposed and successfully tested the "bag filter method," it is expected that more than 10,000 kilograms of carbon black can be recovered each year.

In the past six months, various petroleum factories and mines have also promoted many advanced experiences. For example, Northeast Petroleum Factory No. 4 promoted the advanced experience of equipment maintenance from Liaoyuan Power Plant, and Northeast Petroleum Factory No. 9 promoted the advanced experience of rapid tunneling. The promotion of these advanced experiences has also greatly promoted the over-fulfillment of the production plan in the first half of the year.

Xinhua News Agency, July 9th: Factories and mines under the Steel Industry Administration of the Central People's Government's Ministry of Heavy Industry have overfulfilled the production value plan and the output plan for five major products for the first half of the year. The total production value of the bureau in the first half of the year exceeded the plan by 7.99%, pig iron exceeded the plan by 4.75%, steel exceeded the plan by 2.91%, steel products exceeded the plan by 6.08%, iron ore exceeded the plan by 3.39%, and metallurgical coke exceeded the plan by 3.58%. By the end of June, the Steel Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry had completed 54.5% of this year's profit delivery plan.

Among the factory and mining enterprises under the Steel Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry, twenty-one units completed the production plan of major products ahead of schedule; eleven units completed the production plan of major products comprehensively on a monthly basis in the first half of the year.

Most of the enterprises under the Steel Bureau have carried out the responsibility system with the production area management system as the center in the first half of the year, focusing on establishing a system of responsibility by the director, rationally dividing the production area, deploying cadres and reorganizing functional organizations accordingly, so that leaders at all levels have clarified their positions and responsibilities, and also clarified the role of functional departments in consolidating the system of responsibility by the director, effectively reducing or eliminating the phenomenon of no one being responsible, and further improving the level of enterprise management.

Since the first half of the year, enterprises under the Steel Bureau have achieved considerable results in continuing to promote major advanced experiences. For example, in mining, Longyan Iron Mine focused on adopting the new mining method suggested by Soviet experts, which can increase the recovery rate from about 60% in the past to more than 90%. For example, in ironmaking, the Soviet advanced experience of furnace top adjustment and graded charging was promoted, and the raw material management system was strengthened. In the first half of the year, the blast furnace production of the bureau was relatively stable. This year, the number of production reductions due to accidents only accounted for 15% of the production reductions in the same period last year. The effective volume utilization coefficient of the blast furnace at Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, which has made significant progress in blast furnace production, has been significantly improved. The average daily output of pig iron produced by this plant in June increased by 21.86% compared with January. The overall overhaul time of four blast furnaces in the bureau in the first half of the year was shortened by 21.36% compared with the plan, increasing the value of pig iron produced by about 5.3 billion yuan. In terms of open-hearth furnaces, most units shortened the cold repair time by 11% compared with the plan due to the implementation of the parallel operation method of cold repair of open-hearth furnaces in the first half of the year, which can increase the value of open-hearth steel produced by about 4.6 billion yuan.

    全国石油工业和钢铁工业管理局所属厂矿
    超额完成上半年国家生产计划
    【新华社九日讯】全国石油工业超额完成今年上半年的国家生产计划。工业总产值完成计划的百分之一百一十五点七；四项主要产品的完成计划情况是：原油完成百分之一百零七点六，汽油完成百分之一百零八点九，煤油完成百分之一百二十九点五，柴油完成百分之一百二十一点八。东北石油一厂的十三种主要产品到六月二十三日已经提前完成今年上半年的生产计划。今年上半年的生产水平和去年同期比较：工业总产值超过了去年同期的百分之五十以上；四项主要产品最低的超过百分之二十八点三；最高的超过百分之九十六点九。
    今年上半年，石油工业各厂矿普遍开展了合理化建议工作。这一工作的开展不但为国家创造了大量财富，同时也进一步保证了今年上半年生产计划的超额完成。如东北石油一厂技术员海德俨，研究成功了将一部分凝固点低的二号轻油不经过处理就和冷榨油混合起来，减少脱蜡过程，可以多产轻质油，每年可给国家创造三百五十亿元以上的财富；石蜡车间改进设备，增加处理量，给国家创造财富达一百八十亿元以上。隆昌碳黑厂过去因设备上的限制，建厂几年来由车间天窗跑出去的碳黑达五万多公斤，经技术检查科炉法试制组提出和试验成功了“袋式过滤法”后，预计每年可以收回碳黑一万多公斤。
    各石油厂矿半年来还推广了不少先进经验，如东北石油四厂推广了辽源电厂的设备检修先进经验，东北石油九厂推广了快速掘进的先进经验，这些先进经验的推广也大大促进了上半年生产计划的超额完成。
    【新华社九日讯】中央人民政府重工业部钢铁工业管理局所属工厂矿山，超额完成了上半年生产总值计划和五种主要产品的产量计划。全局上半年的生产总值超过计划百分之七点九九，生铁超过计划百分之四点七五，钢超过计划百分之二点九一，钢材超过计划百分之六点零八，铁矿石超过计划百分之三点三九，冶金焦超过计划百分之三点五八。到六月底止，重工业部钢铁局今年的上缴利润计划已完成百分之五十四点五。
    重工业部钢铁局所属各厂矿企业中，有二十一个单位提前全面完成了上半年主要产品生产计划；有十一个单位，在上半年逐月全面地完成了主要产品生产计划。
    钢铁局所属绝大多数的企业在上半年内都开展了以生产区域管理制为中心的责任制工作，着重建立了一长负责制，合理地划分了生产区域，调配了干部并相应地整顿了职能机构，使各级领导都明确了自己的地位和职责，也明确了职能部门的工作对于巩固一长制的作用，有效地减少或消灭了无人负责现象，进一步提高了企业管理工作水平。
    钢铁局所属企业上半年以来在继续推广重大先进经验方面获得了不少成绩。如采矿方面，龙烟铁矿重点采用了苏联专家建议的新采矿法，能使回采率由过去的百分之六十左右提高到百分之九十以上。又如炼铁方面推行了炉顶调剂和分级入炉的苏联先进经验，加强了原料管理制度，上半年来全局高炉生产都比较稳定。今年由于事故减产数字只相当于去年同期减产数字的百分之十五。高炉生产进步较明显的太原钢铁厂高炉有效容积利用系数有显著的提高。这个厂生产的生铁平均日产量六月份比一月份提高了百分之二十一点八六。全局上半年四座高炉大修时间共较计划缩短了百分之二十一点三六，增产生铁价值约五十三亿元。平炉方面多数单位由于推行了平炉冷修平行作业法，上半年中冷修时间较计划缩短百分之十一，约可增产价值四十六亿元的平炉钢。
