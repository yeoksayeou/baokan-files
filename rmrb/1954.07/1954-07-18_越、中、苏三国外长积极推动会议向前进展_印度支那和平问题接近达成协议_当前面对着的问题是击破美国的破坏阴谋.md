Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, July 16th: Our special correspondent reports: After the off-site talks among foreign ministers of various countries over the past week, the discussion on the issue of restoring peace in Indochina at the Geneva Conference is nearing an agreement. As long as the parties involved make further joint efforts with a sincere, realistic, and fair and reasonable attitude to seek solutions to unresolved issues, it will be a matter of the next few days to reach an agreement that is glorious for both sides of the Indochinese conflict.

It is reported that there are currently three documents being studied by various delegations: one is a draft statement of principles by the nine delegations to the Geneva Conference regarding the agreements reached; one is a draft agreement on the cessation of hostilities in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia; and the other is a draft agreement on the monitoring of the cessation of hostilities in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. Based on the results of discussions over the past few weeks, the nine-nation statement will include principled agreements on military armistice and political settlement, including consent to the armistice agreements concluded by the belligerent parties and international supervision; recognition and respect for the complete sovereignty, independence, unity, and territorial integrity of the three Indochinese countries; an agreement that the three countries should not participate in any military alliances and should not allow the establishment of any foreign military bases; an agreement on the political settlement of the three countries through truly democratic and free elections; and an agreement that the participating countries will consult on any issues raised by the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission to consider taking collective measures necessary to ensure compliance with the armistice agreements.

Major issues in the above three drafts are being negotiated and resolved by the foreign ministers in individual contacts, and military representatives from both sides are also studying, revising, and supplementing the details of the armistice agreement drafts.

Individual contacts among the foreign ministers have been particularly frequent over the past week. It has been noted that these individual consultations have been conducted in a good atmosphere, which has helped to bring the different positions of all parties closer. Qualified observers here believe that the discussions to date have revealed more common ground, and there is reason to be cautiously optimistic about the development of the conference.

The activities of Acting Foreign Minister Pham Van Dong, Foreign Minister Molotov, and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai have received special attention from all parties. Their sincere and realistic consultation attitude in seeking an agreement, as well as their just, reasonable, and constructive suggestions, have played a significant role in promoting the progress of the conference. According to information already obtained, the above three draft documents include many important principles previously proposed by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Soviet Union, and China.

Naturally, the Geneva Conference is not without difficulties at present, and there are still some major issues that need to be negotiated and resolved by all parties before an agreement can be reached.

For example, regarding the issue of the demarcation line for the armistice in Vietnam, it is reported that the French delegation has advocated using the 18th parallel north as the demarcation line, and some Western newspaper commentaries do not believe that this is a fair and reasonable demarcation line that is consistent with the actual situation on the battlefield. People know that there are vast liberated areas in Central and Southern Vietnam, where the Vietnam People's Army and the local people have fought together for many years. In view of this situation, the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has proposed that drawing a demarcation line between the 13th and 14th parallels north is reasonable. The distance in this regard is not insurmountable, and it is entirely possible for both sides to move closer together in a spirit of realistic consultation and seek a mutually acceptable demarcation line between the two options.

For example, regarding the issue of holding free elections to achieve national reunification, this is a principle that all parties have long agreed upon. The delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has believed from the beginning that the regional adjustment of the troops on both sides is a temporary measure necessary to achieve an armistice, which should be followed by free elections as soon as possible to achieve national reunification. However, while some delegations verbally agree with reunification and oppose division, they actually oppose the free elections necessary to achieve reunification. The United States has made no secret of the fact that they fear that once free elections are held, the unpopular puppet government like Bao Dai will collapse. Therefore, they are attempting to push the free elections into the distant future. However, in any case, the conference should make further provisions for the holding of free elections.

For example, regarding the issue of the members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, this is one of the more important issues that has not yet been agreed upon regarding the issue of armistice supervision. Other issues, such as the parallel relationship between the Joint Commission and the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, the scope of the two committees' powers, and the voting procedures of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, are generally close to agreement among all parties. The Soviet delegation has proposed two alternative plans for the membership of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, and the British delegation has also proposed a plan. Other delegations have not yet formally proposed other plans, and this issue requires further negotiation.

In addition, the issues of the assembly areas of the troops of both sides in Laos and the guarantees of the participating countries remain to be negotiated and resolved.

The French side bears an important responsibility for the resolution of these issues. It has been noted that the French delegation led by Mendès France has recently adopted a positive attitude. Mendès France's stated determination to resign if an agreement is not reached before July 20 is welcome as long as it can be supplemented by genuine efforts to seek a fair and reasonable agreement. However, one cannot fail to notice that after the separate talks among the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and France in Paris, certain French newspapers have appeared with arguments that France can now propose higher armistice conditions in Geneva. These newspapers are advocating an uncompromising position, attempting to insist on conditions that are not fair and reasonable. If this argument is used at the Geneva Conference, it will only increase the difficulties of the conference and hinder the reaching of an agreement. What the Geneva Conference needs is the sincere and mutually accommodating spirit of the parties concerned in order to reach an armistice that is glorious for both sides of the conflict.

The American ruling group is the one that least wants the Geneva Conference to reach an agreement. In view of the United States' consistent policy of obstruction and sabotage of the Geneva Conference, there is every reason to remain highly vigilant about the attitude of the United States in the final stages of the conference. There are various signs that the closer the Geneva Conference gets to reaching an agreement, the more intensified the sabotage activities from the United States become. The current problem facing the Geneva Conference is: to smash the American conspiracy of sabotage, for the parties concerned to work together, to resolve the remaining issues in accordance with fair and reasonable principles, and to reach an agreement as soon as possible to realize the restoration of peace in Indochina that the people of the world are expecting.

    越、中、苏三国外长积极推动会议向前进展
    印度支那和平问题接近达成协议
    当前面对着的问题是击破美国的破坏阴谋
    【新华社日内瓦十六日电】本社特派记者报道：经过过去一周来各国外长间的会外会谈，日内瓦会议关于恢复印度支那和平问题的讨论已接近于达成协议。只要有关方面本着真诚、现实和公平合理的态度进一步共同努力，对尚未解决的问题寻求解决办法，达成对印度支那交战双方都是光荣的协议将是最近几天之内的事情了。
    据悉，目前有三种文件正由各代表团研究中：一种是日内瓦会议九国代表团关于已达成的协议的原则声明草案；一种是关于越南、老挝、柬埔寨三国的停止敌对行动协定草案；还有一种是关于越南、老挝、柬埔寨三国停止敌对行动的监察问题的协议草案。根据过去数周的讨论的结果看来，九国声明将包括有关军事停战和政治解决的原则性的协议，其中涉及对交战双方缔结的停战协定及国际监察的同意；对印度支那三国完全的主权、独立、统一和领土完整的承认与尊重；对三国不应参加任何军事同盟和不容许建立任何外国军事基地的协议；对三国经过真正民主的自由选举以实现政治解决的协议以及与会各国同意将就中立国监察委员会向他们提出的任何问题进行协商，以考虑采取为保证遵守停战协定所必需的集体措施等方面。
    上述三种草案中的重大问题正由外长们在个别接触中协商解决，双方军事代表也正在就停战协定草案的细节进行研究、修改和补充。
    过去一周中外长们的个别接触特别频繁，人们注意到，这些个别商谈是在良好的空气中进行的，有助于各方面不同立场的接近。此间有资格的观察家认为，迄今的商谈已发现了更多的共同之点，有理由对会议的发展持审慎的乐观看法。
    范文同代理外长、莫洛托夫外长以及周恩来外长的活动特别受到各方面的重视。他们为谋求达成协议所持的真诚的、现实的协商态度以及他们所提出的公正合理的、建设性的建议，对于会议的进展起了重大的推动作用。据已获得的消息显示，上述三种文件草案中包括了越南民主共和国、苏联、中国方面过去历次所提出的许多重要原则。
    自然，日内瓦会议目前不是没有困难，在达成协议之前仍有若干重大问题尚待各方协商解决。
    例如，关于在越南的停战的分界线问题，据悉，法国代表团曾主张以北纬十八度为分界线，若干西方报纸的评论也不认为这是符合于目前战场实际情况的公平合理的分界线。人们知道，在中越和南越有着广大的解放区，越南人民军和当地人民一起，曾在那里奋斗多年。鉴于这种情况，越南民主共和国代表团曾提出北纬十三度和十四度之间划一分界线是合理的。这方面的距离并不是不可克服的，只要双方本着现实的协商精神向前靠拢，在两个方案之间寻求双方可以接受的分界线是完全可能的。
    又如，关于举行自由选举以实现国家统一问题，这是各方早已同意的原则。越南民主共和国代表团从一开始就认为，双方军队进行区域调整是为了实现停战所必需的临时措施，继之应尽早举行自由选举以达到国家的统一。然而，某些代表团虽然口头上赞成统一，反对分治，实际上却反对为实现统一所必需的自由选举。美国方面就毫不讳言，他们害怕一旦举行自由选举，像保大这样不得人心的傀儡政府就会垮台。因此，他们企图把自由选举推到遥遥无期的未来。但是，无论如何，会议应对自由选举的举行作出进一步的规定。
    又如，关于中立国监察委员会的成员问题，这是关于停战监察问题中尚未获致协议的较重要的问题之一。其他如关于联合委员会和中立国监察委员会的平行关系、两个委员会的职权范围以及中立国监察委员会的表决程序等问题，各方意见已大致接近。苏联代表团对中立国监察委员会的成员问题已提出了两个任择其一的方案，英国代表团也提出了一个方案，其他代表团尚未正式提出其他方案，这个问题尚需进一步协商。
    此外，在老挝的双方军队的集结地区问题以及与会各国的保证问题等方面，也有待协商解决。
    对于这些问题的解决，法国方面负有重要的责任。人们注意到，以孟戴斯—弗朗斯为首的法国代表团近来所采取的积极的态度。孟戴斯—弗朗斯所表示的在七月二十日之前达不成协议就辞职的决心，只要能辅之以真正寻求达成公平合理的协议的努力，是值得欢迎的。但是，人们也不能不注意到，在美、英、法三国外长在巴黎单独会谈之后，某些法国报刊出现了这样的论调，即认为：法国现在可以在日内瓦提出更高的停战条件，这些报刊在鼓吹一种不妥协的主张，企图坚持那种不是公平合理的条件。如果这种主张用之于日内瓦会议，那末，它只会增加会议的困难，阻挠协议的达成。日内瓦会议需要的是有关方面的真诚的、互相让步的精神，以求达成对交战双方都是光荣的停战。
    最不希望日内瓦会议达成协议的是美国统治集团，鉴于美国一贯的阻挠和破坏日内瓦会议的政策，人们对于美国在会议最后阶段中的态度完全有理由保持着高度的警惕。有种种迹象显示，日内瓦会议愈接近达成协议，来自美国方面的破坏活动就愈发变本加厉。日内瓦会议当前面对着的问题是：击破美国的破坏阴谋，有关各方共同努力，根据公平合理的原则解决尚存的问题，早日达成协议以实现全世界人民期待着的恢复印度支那的和平。
