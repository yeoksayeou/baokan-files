    The French Communist Party fights for peace, freedom, and national independence
    French Communist Party Central Committee Secretary Jacques Duclos
    The 13th Congress of the French Communist Party was held in Ivry, a suburb of Paris, in early June. The agenda of the congress consisted of three items: a work report from the Central Committee; a report on organizational issues; and a report on youth work.
    In order to correctly guide and promote the pre-congress discussions in all party organizations, provinces, and districts, the Central Committee presented three documents to the entire party: a draft program on the political situation and the tasks of the French Communist Party; a draft resolution on organizational issues; and a draft resolution on youth work.
    The publication of these documents raised the level of pre-meeting political discussion and drew the attention of party activists to the main problems in the current political situation facing the French working class and people.
    American imperialists, who provoked the war of aggression against Korea and attempted to expand the war in Indochina, are using every means to enslave France and revive German militarism.
    The 13th Congress proved that more and more French people are rising up against the American imperialists' plan to revive German militarism, a plan that would make our country a military appendage of the former Hitler generals and undermine the economic foundation of French national independence.
    Any policy that obeys American imperialists has a negative impact on the French economy. This policy is manifested in: the closure of many coal pits; the transfer of miners from one area to another; serious backwardness in electricity production; and attempts to eliminate many industrial sectors because competition from these industrial sectors makes American monopolies uneasy.
    The French Communist Party leads the working class in a persistent struggle against policies that undermine the economic foundation of French independence. More and more French people have joined the struggle for national independence and peace.
    The work of the 13th Congress demonstrated the passionate patriotism of the working class and their strong will to save France from decline. During the congress, the moving expressions of proletarian internationalism demonstrated the full significance of the national independence policy for which our party is fighting.
    The congress warmly welcomed many delegations from fraternal parties of various countries and received congratulatory telegrams from fraternal parties that were unable to send representatives to the congress.
    The reading of the glorious Communist Party of the Soviet Union's congratulatory message was the most moving moment. It showed the love and trust of the French Communists for the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.
    The delegates expressed the feelings of the vast majority of the French people, talking about the unbreakable friendship with the great Soviet state and the desire of the French people to implement a foreign policy based on the Franco-Soviet Treaty—a guarantee of security and peace.
    The Chinese Communist Party's congratulations to the congress were very warmly welcomed. This warm welcome was a manifestation of the will of the French working class and people, who strive to have the French government recognize the People's Republic of China and recognize that the People's Republic of China should obtain a legitimate status in the United Nations.
    The delegates to the congress had a full understanding of their responsibilities and the obligations of their nation, and they warmly welcomed the congratulations from the Vietnam Workers' Party.
    The congratulations from the Vietnam Workers' Party and the attendance of representatives sent by people oppressed under French colonists, have particularly great significance. Representatives of the Algerian, Moroccan and Tunisian Communist Parties exposed the evil activities of the French colonists in their countries; at the same time, they expressed their trust in the working class, the French people and the French Communist Party.
    The French Communist Party supports the colonial people who are fighting for freedom, which is also in the interests of France. If France recognizes the independent rights of the colonial people, it will create conditions for establishing friendly relations with them.
    The achievements of the socialist and peace camp and certain easing of international tensions—but one cannot overestimate it—are encouraging factors. The French people's resistance to the plan to establish a "European Defense Community" is growing, and across the country, the movement in support of the Soviet Union's proposed "All-European Treaty to Ensure European Collective Security" is also strengthening.
    The congress summarized the achievements of the struggle for peace. The congress emphasized that it is necessary to strive for a more active participation of the working class in this struggle, and the establishment of peace committees in various industrial enterprises will make the struggle against the ratification of the "European Defense Community" treaty more effective.
                  ×　　　×　　　×
    The congress once again proved the unwavering determination of the French Communist Party, which, as Maurice Thorez emphasized, "Our party will definitely support any policy as long as it meets the following three main national requirements:
    1. In terms of foreign policy—refuse to ratify the Bonn and Paris treaties; ceasefire in Indochina; favor the establishment of a European collective security system; eliminate differences between major powers through consultation.
    2. Meet the urgent economic demands of the working class and all working people.
    3. Resolutely defend democratic freedoms.
    The congress proved that the Communists are ready to support any practical and effective improvement, any measures that are in the interests of the working class and the people, and in the interests of peace, whether in parliament or throughout the country."
    In order to achieve the victory of this political policy, it is first necessary to realize the unity of action of the working class, and it is necessary to make more practical and effective efforts to strive for unified action with the working people participating in the Socialist Party (who are worried about the policy of the party's leader, Guy Mollet, who is striving to ratify the "European Defense Community" treaty).
    The Central Committee and the Political Bureau of the Central Committee conducted self-criticism of their work at the congress. This criticism showed our party's loyalty to the principles of Marxism-Leninism. The mistakes made by the French Communist Party have caused many difficulties for itself.
    Here, it should be mentioned the factional activities of Marty. Due to the failure of the February 12 and June 4, 1952 strikes and the strengthening of the reactionaries' persecution, at that time there appeared in our party a dangerous tendency of underestimating the influence of the people's power and belittling the role of the working class in the struggle against reactionary forces.
    As everyone knows, Marty has consistently attempted to ignore the achievements of the Soviet Union in defeating Hitler's Germany. At the same time, Marty tried to reduce the role of the party, opposed consolidating the unity of action of the masses in defending the cause of peace, and wanted to make the youth organization leave the path of broad unity of the younger generation in the struggle for peace and national independence.
    Marty showed great contempt for theoretical issues; he opposed the Leninist principles of party building. On all these issues, Marty mostly received the support of Tillon.
    At the same time, the French Communist Party also had to fight against the organizational opportunism of the former Central Committee Secretary Lecoeur. The purpose of Lecoeur's activities was to weaken the party by undermining the Leninist principle that all party members have the obligation to struggle for the implementation of the party's policies. Lecoeur attempted to turn the party branches into small groups that were not subject to any supervision by the party and had no contact with the masses.
    Lecoeur pursued an adventurous and opportunistic policy in organizational issues, trying to turn the party into a political appendage of certain bourgeois groups. He played a double-dealing trick and trampled on inner-party democracy, implementing a policy of conspiracy that favored the enemies of the working class.
    The 13th Congress clearly pointed out that in order to complete the current tasks of the party, the party must fight against various deviations, just as it had opposed Marty's deviation in the past and Lecoeur's deviation which occurred under different circumstances. The party must also oppose the liberalism of certain people who are always ready to collude with opportunists and sectarians, and use this to hinder our struggle against various deviations.
    The congress made extremely timely instructions on this, calling on the French Communist Party to strengthen ideological work to prevent the ideas of the enemies of the working class, the gravediggers of national independence, and the instigators of war from infiltrating the party ranks. In order to defend the party's ideological purity and enhance the party's unity and combat effectiveness, it is necessary to fight against various deviations. And only through criticism and self-criticism can this struggle achieve victory.
    The 13th Congress paid special attention to carrying out the party's organizational work in enterprises, enlivening grassroots party organizations, selecting cadres and replenishing cadres with young communist party members, strengthening educational work and improving the party's ideological level.
    The congress carefully examined the issue of youth work. The Party believes that organizing youth to struggle is the Party's own business. Therefore, the Party emphasizes that it is necessary to defend the demands and rights of youth—young workers, young farmers, students; it is necessary to make the younger generation and youth organizations fight against all kinds of bourgeois ideas; it is necessary to help young people establish their own organizations and receive education; it is necessary to explain to young people the true reasons for their current situation, and point out the prospects for their struggle.
    The French Communist Party faces huge tasks that are of decisive significance for the future of France. It is necessary to smash the conspiracies of the American imperialists and their French agents. They want to enslave France by dragging France into the "European Defense Community"—a guise for the revival of German militarism.
    It is necessary to make unremitting efforts to make the masses of people, led by the working class, participate in the struggle; they are able to stop the ratification of the "European Defense Community" treaty.
    It is necessary to prevent the possibility of American war instigators and their French accomplices continuing and expanding the Indochina War.
    France's foreign policy must be fundamentally changed so that France can get rid of American control, so that it can take policies that conform to the will of the people in all aspects, and prevent the war conspiracies of the American imperialists and German revanchists from being realized.
    The 13th Congress made our party stronger and more united, better armed with theory, and more able to lead the working class and the masses of people to fight for national independence and peace, for democratic freedom, for meeting the demands of the working masses, and for the victory of socialism.

    法国共产党为和平、自由和民族独立而斗争
    法国共产党中央委员会书记　雅克·杜克洛
    法国共产党第十三次代表大会于六月初在巴黎郊区依夫列举行。大会的议程有三项：中央委员会工作报告；关于组织问题的报告；关于青年工作的报告。
    为了正确地指导和推动在一切党组织、各省和各区中进行的大会召开前的讨论，中央委员会向全党提出三个文件：关于政治情况和法国共产党的任务的纲领草案；关于组织问题的决议草案；关于青年工作的决议草案。
    这些文件的公布提高了会前政治讨论的水平，并使党的积极分子注意到目前法国工人阶级和人民面临的政治情况中的主要问题。
    挑起侵朝战争和企图扩大印度支那战争的美国帝国主义者，正在用一切方法来奴役法国和复活德国军国主义。
    第十三次代表大会证明，愈来愈多的法国人起而反对美国帝国主义者旨在复活德国军国主义的计划，这个计划是要使我国成为从前希特勒将军们的军事附庸，使法国民族独立的经济基础遭到破坏。
    一切听命于美国帝国主义者的政策，对法国的经济造成了恶劣的影响。这个政策表现在：许多煤坑停业；矿工被从这一地区调到另一地区；电力生产严重落后；企图取消许多工业部门，因为这些工业部门的竞争使美国垄断组织感到不安。
    法国共产党领导着工人阶级，对破坏法国独立的经济基础的政策进行坚持不懈的斗争。投入争取民族独立与和平的斗争中来的法国人，已经愈来愈多了。
    第十三次代表大会的工作，显示出了工人阶级热情的爱国主义和他们把法国从衰落中拯救出来的坚强意志。在代表大会期间，无产阶级国际主义的动人的表现，显示了我们党为之作斗争的民族独立政策的全部重要意义。
    大会热烈欢迎了各国兄弟党的许多代表团，并收到那些不能派遣代表参加大会的兄弟党的贺电。
    宣读光荣的苏联共产党的贺电是最动人的一刻。它表明了法国共产党人对苏联共产党的热爱和信任。
    代表们表达了绝大多数法国人民的感情，他们谈到与伟大苏维埃国家的牢不可破的友谊，谈到法国人民力求实施以法苏条约——安全与和平的保证——为基础的外交政策的愿望。
    中国共产党对代表大会的祝贺受到了非常热烈的欢迎。这种热烈的欢迎是法国工人阶级和人民的意志的表现，他们力求使法国政府承认中华人民共和国，承认中华人民共和国应在联合国取得合法地位。
    大会代表对自己的责任和本民族应负的义务有着充分的理解，他们热烈地欢迎了越南劳动党的祝贺。
    越南劳动党的祝贺和在法国殖民者压迫下的人民所派代表的出席大会，具有特别重大的意义。阿尔及利亚、摩洛哥和突尼斯共产党的代表揭露了法国殖民者在他们的国家里的罪恶活动；同时，他们表示了他们对工人阶级、法国人民和法国共产党的信任。
    法国共产党支持为自由而斗争的殖民地人民，这也是为了法国的利益。法国承认了殖民地人民的独立权利，就能为与他们建立友好关系创造条件。
    社会主义与和平阵营的成就，国际紧张局势的某些缓和——但不能对它估计过高——，是令人鼓舞的因素。法国人民对建立“欧洲防务集团”计划的反抗情绪日益增长，在全国，拥护苏联提出的“保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约”草案的运动也在加强。
    大会总结了争取和平的斗争的成绩。大会强调必须争取工人阶级更加积极地参加这个斗争，并在各工业企业设立和平委员会，这会使得反对批准
  “欧洲防务集团”条约的斗争更为有效。
                  ×　　　×　　　×
    大会再一次证明了法国共产党的坚定不移的决心，这种决心就是，正如莫里斯·多列士着重指出的，“任何政策只要符合下列三项主要的民族要求，我们党一定予以支持：
    一、外交政策方面——拒绝批准波恩和巴黎条约；在印度支那停火；赞成建立欧洲集体安全体系；通过协商方式消除大国间的分歧。
    二、满足工人阶级和全体劳动人民迫切的经济要求。
    三、切实保卫民主自由。
    大会证明了共产党人无论在议会里或在全国各地随时准备支持任何切实有效的改进，支持任何符合工人阶级和人民的利益以及符合和平的利益的措施。”
    为了使这一政治方针取得胜利，必须首先实现工人阶级行动的统一，必须作更加切实有效的努力，争取同参加社会党的劳动人民（他们正在为该党的领导者居伊·摩勒的力求批准“欧洲防务集团”条约的政策而耽忧）采取统一行动。
    中央委员会和中央委员会政治局在大会上对自己的工作进行了自我批评，这种批评表明了我们党对马克思列宁主义原则的忠诚。法国共产党所犯的错误为自己造成了许多困难。
    这里应当提到马尔梯的派别活动。由于一九五二年二月十二日和六月四日罢工的失败和反动派迫害的加强，那时在我们党的队伍中出现了对人民力量的影响估计不足和轻视工人阶级在反对反动势力斗争中的作用的危险倾向。
    大家知道，马尔梯一贯企图漠视苏联战胜希特勒德国的成就。同时，马尔梯力图降低党的作用，反对巩固人民群众在保卫和平事业中的行动的统一，要使青年组织离开在争取和平与民族独立的斗争中所走的青年一代广泛团结的道路。
    马尔梯对理论问题表现了极大的轻蔑；他反对列宁主义的建党原则。在所有这些问题上，马尔梯大都得到了狄戎的支持。
    同时，法国共产党还不得不与前中央委员会书记勒戈尔在组织问题上的取消主义进行斗争。勒戈尔活动的目的，是要通过破坏关于一切党员有为实现党的政策而斗争的义务这一列宁主义原则来削弱党。勒戈尔企图把党支部变成一些不受党的任何监督和与群众没有任何联系的小集团。
    勒戈尔在组织问题上实行冒险主义和机会主义的政策，力图把党变成某些资产阶级集团的政治上的附属品。他玩弄两面派手法并践踏党内民主，实行那种有利于工人阶级敌人的阴谋的政策。
    第十三次代表大会清楚地指出，为了完成党的当前任务，党就要像过去曾反对过马尔梯的偏向以及在不同情况下发生的勒戈尔的偏向那样，与各种偏向作斗争。党也必须反对某些人的自由主义，这些人随时都准备同机会主义者和宗派主义者相勾结，并以此来阻挠我们反对各种偏向的斗争。
    大会就此作出了极其及时的指示，号召法国共产党加强思想工作，以防止工人阶级的敌人的思想、民族独立的葬送者和战争挑拨者的思想侵入党的队伍。为了保卫党的思想上的纯洁性，增强党的团结和战斗力，就必须与各色各样的偏向作斗争。而只有展开批评和自我批评才能使这个斗争取得胜利。
    第十三次代表大会特别重视开展企业中党的组织工作，活跃基层党组织，挑选干部和以青年共产党员补充干部，加强教育工作和提高党的思想水平。
    大会周密地考察了青年工作问题。党认为组织青年进行斗争是党的切身事业。因此，党强调必须保卫青年——青年工人、青年农民、学生——的要求和权利；必须使青年一代和青年组织与各色各样的资产阶级思想作斗争；必须帮助青年们建立自己的组织和受到教育，必须向青年们阐明他们目前处境的真正原因，指出他们斗争的前途。
    法国共产党面临着对法国前途具有决定意义的巨大任务。必须粉碎美帝国主义者和他们的法国代理人的阴谋。他们想通过把法国拖入“欧洲防务集团”——复活德国军国主义的幌子——的办法来奴役法国。
    必须进行不懈的努力使以工人阶级为首的人民群众参加斗争，他们是能够阻止批准“欧洲防务集团”条约的。
    必须防止美国的战争挑拨者和他们的法国同谋者继续并扩大印度支那战争的可能性。
    法国的外交政策必须根本改变，以便法国能够摆脱美国的控制，使它能够在各方面采取符合人民意志的政策，并阻止美国帝国主义者和德国复仇主义者的战争阴谋实现。
    第十三次代表大会，使我们的党变得更强大和更团结，更好地用理论武装起来，并且更能够领导工人阶级和人民群众为民族独立与和平、为民主自由、为满足劳动群众的要求、为社会主义的胜利而斗争。
