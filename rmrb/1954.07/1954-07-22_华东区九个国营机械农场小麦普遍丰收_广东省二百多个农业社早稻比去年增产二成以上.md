　　Wheat Harvests Universally Bountiful on Nine State-Run Mechanical Farms in East China
　　Early Rice Production on Over 200 Agricultural Cooperatives in Guangdong Province Increases by More Than 20% Compared to Last Year

　　This year, the wheat harvests on nine state-run mechanical farms in East China, including Dongxin, Fangqiuhu, Shouxihu, and Guangbei, have been universally bountiful. The yield per unit area on each farm has increased by 20% to 100% compared to 1953, exceeding the wheat yield per unit area of local farmers. Most farms have overfulfilled their production and financial plans. The wheat harvested by the farms are all superior varieties such as Xuzhou No. 438, Qida No. 195, and Nanda No. 2419. In addition to the seeds reserved for their own use, these superior wheat seeds can be supplied to farmers for planting.

　　During the summer harvest, the farms deployed a total of 33 combine harvesters, harvesting more than 54,000 mu. Li Deshun's tractor team at the Dongxin Farm created a new record by harvesting 578.14 mu in 13 and a half hours during the wheat harvest, with a machinery utilization rate of 79.7%. Labor model Song Chunkui's team averaged 420 mu of harvesting per day during the wheat harvest, exceeding the farm's work quota of 350 mu by 20%. At the state-run Guangbei Farm, Li Guangsan's tractor team implemented joint operations with two Stalin No. 6 tractor-drawn combine harvesters, enabling them to harvest 774 mu per shift, exceeding the shift quota by 44%.

　　After the summer harvest, the farms immediately completed the summer planting work. This year, the summer planting area of each farm has expanded by 60.87% compared to 1953, mainly due to the expansion of the planting area of oil crops. Currently, the seedlings of summer crops are growing well.

　　The more than 200 agricultural production cooperatives newly established in Guangdong Province this spring have seen an increase of more than 20% in early rice production compared to last year. In the Chaoshan Plain area, agricultural production cooperatives in Jieyang, Chaoan, Puning, Chaoyang, and other counties have mostly increased production by 20% to 40%. The first agricultural production cooperative in Jinggang Township, Jieyang, harvested over 50,000 jin of dry grain from its 87 mu of paddy fields, with an average yield of 580 jin per mu, an increase of 32.4% compared to last year. The Liu Binlie agricultural production cooperative in Guanbu Township, Chaoyang, has two high-yield plots, totaling 7.89 mu, which harvested 6,129 jin of dry grain, with an average yield of 776 jin of grain per mu, setting a new record for early rice production in Guangdong. Agricultural production cooperatives in the Hainan Island area generally increased production by 10% to 50%, with nine cooperatives increasing production by 50% to 90%, and two cooperatives increasing production by more than 100%. Early-maturing varieties in mountainous areas of northern Guangdong have also been harvested. The 160 mu of rice in the Qunxing Agricultural Cooperative in Qujiang County all saw an increase of 40% compared to last year.

    华东区九个国营机械农场小麦普遍丰收
    广东省二百多个农业社早稻比去年增产二成以上
    今年华东区东辛、方邱湖、寿西湖、广北等九个国营机械农场的小麦普遍丰收，各场单位面积产量比一九五三年增产二成到一倍，都超过当地农民小麦单位面积产量。大部分农场都超额完成生产财务计划。各农场收获的小麦都是徐州四三八号、齐大一九五号、南大二四一九号等优良品种。这些优良麦种除预留麦种外，都可供应农民作种籽。
    在夏收中，各场共出动三十三台联合收割机，收割了五万四千多亩。东辛农场李德顺机车小组在麦收中创造了在十三个小时半的时间内，收割五百七十八点一四亩的新纪录，机具利用率达百分之七十九点七。劳动模范宋春奎小组，在麦收中每天平均收割四百二十亩，超过农场班定额三百五十亩的百分之二十。国营广北农场李光三机车小组实行两台斯大林六号拖拉式联合收割机的联结作业，每班能收割七百七十四亩，超过班定额的百分之四十四。
    各场在夏收后，紧接着完成了夏种工作。今年各场的夏种面积较一九五三年扩大百分之六十点八七，主要是扩大了油料作物的播种面积。目前夏种作物出苗情况良好。

    广东省今春新建立的二百多个农业生产合作社，早稻比去年增产二成以上。潮汕平原地区，揭阳、潮安、普宁、潮阳等县的农业生产合作社，大都增产二成至四成。揭阳京岗乡第一农业生产合作社的八十七亩稻田，共收干谷五万余斤，平均每亩产量五百八十斤，比去年增产百分之三十二点四。潮阳关埠乡刘宾烈农业生产合作社有两丘丰产田，共七点八九市亩，收干谷六千一百二十九斤，平均每
  亩产谷子七百七十六斤，创造了广东早稻丰产新纪录。海南岛地区农业生产合作社一般都增产一成到
  五成，并有九个社增产五成到九成，两个社增产一倍以上。粤北近山地区的早熟品种也已收割，曲江县群星农业社一百六十多亩水稻，都比去年增产四成。
