Xinhua News Agency, Tel Aviv, 19th (TASS): The Israeli newspaper "People's Voice" reported that the congress of the Israeli Communist Party's local committee was held in Jaffa. The congress passed a resolution calling on the Israeli people to widely participate in the people's vote organized by the Israeli Peace Council on the issue of rearming West Germany; to strengthen the friendship between Israel and the Soviet Union; to strengthen unity in the struggle against the new attacks by the government and employers on the people's living standards; to fight against the fascist draft law on "anti-national crimes"; and to protest against arbitrary actions, especially protesting the arrest in Nazareth of members of the Israeli Communist Youth League's organization in that city.
