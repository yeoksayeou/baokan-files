    The Completion of the Soviet Atomic Energy Industrial Power Station
    Gives Great Encouragement to the Chinese Scientific Community
    [This newspaper dispatch] The Soviet Council of Ministers' communiqué on the start of power generation at the Soviet Union's first atomic energy industrial power station has given tremendous encouragement to the Chinese scientific community.
    Li Siguang, Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, expressed his thoughts on this new achievement, saying: The Soviet Union's recent success in using atomic energy to generate electricity is an epoch-making achievement of Soviet science and another concrete manifestation of science serving peaceful construction within our peaceful camp. This stands in sharp contrast to the clamor of American imperialism for manufacturing various atomic weapons to destroy human civilization. Wu Youxun, Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said: In the construction of communism, the Soviet Union was the first to master the method of using atomic energy to produce electricity and built the first atomic power station for peaceful industrial service. These facts illustrate the advanced nature of Soviet science. At the same time, it shows that only under the superior socialist system can science achieve such a leap in progress and development. Yan Jici, President of the Northeast Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, pointed out: The communiqué on the start of power generation at the Soviet Union's first atomic power station marks the beginning of an unprecedented industrial and technological revolution and is a great victory for mankind in the struggle against the forces of nature. On the horizon of the Soviet socialist country, the dawn of communism is increasingly showing its immense radiance. He called on all honest scientists in the world, especially physicists, to express their determination: apart from peaceful construction, never engage in atomic energy research for war purposes. Liu Xianzhou, Vice President of Tsinghua University, expressed the following opinion on this communiqué: The success of the Soviet atomic energy industrial power station not only proves that the US imperialist policy of atomic weapons blackmail is doomed to complete failure, but also makes a great contribution to human society, which will create a happy life for mankind. Ye Qisun, professor of the Physics Department of Peking University, believes that: From the rapid and outstanding achievements of Soviet scientists, we can see the abundance of Soviet scientific research talents, and we can also see the superiority of developing science under the socialist system. Zhao Zhongyao, an expert in nuclear research, expressed his feelings: The Soviet Union has always advocated the use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes, and in the past, atomic explosions were used to transform nature. This time, an atomic energy power station was established at an amazing speed, which fully demonstrates that the speed and contribution of scientific and industrial development under the socialist system are unlimited. Zhou Peiyuan, Provost of Peking University, said: The historical significance of using atomic energy for power generation is no less than the invention of the steam engine and the induction generator. It is the most glorious page in the history of mankind's conquest and transformation of nature. The wide application of atomic energy will enable us to foresee that modern cities will appear in desert areas, new aircraft will travel around the earth without stopping to refuel, the icebergs at the North and South Poles will no longer be obstacles to submarine voyages, and interplanetary transportation can be realized with long-range rockets. Atomic energy serving the national economy will bring unlimited and beautiful prospects to mankind. Qian Weichang, Provost of Tsinghua University, expressed his opinion: Advanced Soviet scientists and engineers have successfully liberated the atomic energy hidden deep in the material world and effectively controlled this energy, just like hydropower and thermal energy, serving the peaceful life of our human beings. Atomic energy power stations will have a profound and tremendous impact on all aspects of industrial construction and will greatly increase human productivity. We, the people who are growing up in the great socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, should cheer for this great achievement. Wang Ganchang, Deputy Director of the Institute of Modern Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said: This proves that only under the socialist system can science achieve such a high speed of development, and only under the socialist system can the discovery of atomic energy benefit mankind. Peng Huanwu, Deputy Director of the Institute of Modern Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said: Using atomic energy for peaceful construction is much more difficult than using it for destructive construction, but Soviet scientists have mastered this technology and built the world's first atomic energy power station. This great achievement fully demonstrates the superiority of the Soviet socialist system. Lu Xueshan, Acting Director of the Institute of Applied Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, pointed out: The generation of electricity by atomic energy industrial power stations means the transformation of the entire production technology of power engineering and plays a huge role in communist construction. The generation of electricity by atomic energy industrial power stations once again declares to the world the wishes of the peace and democracy camp: we want peace, and we are working hard to build a better and ideal society. Chu Shenglin, Director of the Physics Department of Peking University, said: The construction of atomic energy industrial power stations involves the mastery of many aspects of the most modern scientific principles and technologies, the most advanced engineering design, and also requires a high industrial foundation. This achievement proves that the Soviet Union's scientific and industrial technology has reached the first place in the world. Yu Fuchun, professor of the Physics Department of Peking University, said: This great achievement of Soviet science makes us clearly realize that once science is in the hands of the working people, its development will be unlimited. Chinese scientific workers will definitely learn from the Soviet Union and strive for the socialist construction of the motherland and the defense of world peace.

    苏联原子能工业电力站的建成
    给中国科学界以巨大的鼓舞
    【本报讯】苏联部长会议关于苏联第一个原子能工业电力站开始发电的公报给予中国科学界以巨大的鼓舞。
    中国科学院副院长李四光对这一新的成就发表感想说：苏联最近应用原子能发电的成功，是苏维埃科学划时代的卓越成就，也是在我们和平阵营中科学为和平建设事业服务的又一次具体表现，这和美帝国主义制造各种原子武器毁灭人类文明的叫嚣成为鲜明的对比。中国科学院副院长吴有训说：在共产主义建设中苏联首先掌握了利用原子能生产电力的方法，建成了第一个为和平工业服务的原子电力站，这些事实说明了苏联科学的先进性。同时也说明只有在优越的社会主义制度下，科学才能得到这样飞跃的进步和发展。中国科学院东北分院院长严济慈指出：苏联第一个原子电力站开始发电的公报，标志着史无先例的工业和技术革命的开端，是人类对自然力量斗争的伟大胜利。在苏联社会主义国家的地平线上，共产主义的曙光愈来愈显示了它的万丈光芒。他号召全世界正直的科学家，特别是物理学家，应该表示决心：除了为和平建设以外，决不为战争目的从事原子能的研究。清华大学副校长刘仙洲对这一公报发表如下意见：苏联原子能工业发电站的成功，不但证明着美帝国主义的原子武器讹诈政策要彻底失败，而且是对人类社会的一个极大的贡献，它将为人类创造幸福的生活。北京大学物理系教授叶企孙认为：从苏联科学家的这样迅速的卓越成就，可以看出苏联科学研究人材的丰富，也可看出社会主义制度下发展科学的优越性。研究原子核的专家赵宗尧发表感想说：苏联一贯主张把原子能用于和平事业，过去利用原子的爆炸改造自然，这次以惊人的速度建立原子能的电力站，这充分说明社会主义制度下科学和工业发展的速度和贡献是无限量的。北京大学教务长周培源说：原子能用于发电的历史意义，不亚于蒸汽机和感应发电机的发明。它是人类征服自然、改造自然历史上最光辉的
  一页。原子能的广泛应用，将使我们预见到：在沙漠地区出现现代的城市，新的飞机将无须停留添加燃料而围绕地球航行，地球南北极的冰山将不成为潜水艇航程中的障碍物，而星球间的交通可用远航程的火箭来实现。为国民经济服务的原子能将为人类带来无限美好的远景。清华大学教务长钱伟长发表意见说：先进的苏联科学家和工程师成功地解放了物质世界深处所蕴藏的原子能，有效地控制了这些能量，像水能和热能似的，服务于我们人类的和平生活。原子能发电站对工业建设各方面将发生深刻的巨大的影响，将大大地提高人类的生产力。我们生长在以苏联为首的伟大社会主义阵营的人民，应该为这一巨大的成就而欢呼。中国科学院近代物理研究所副所长王淦昌说：这证明只有在社会主义制度下，科学才能获得这样高速度的发展，也只有在社会主义制度下，才能使原子能的发现为人类谋幸福。中国科学院近代物理研究所副所长彭桓武说：原子能用于和平建设要比用于破坏建设要困难得多，但是苏联科学家能够掌握这种技术，建立了世界上第一个原子能发电站。这一巨大成就充分说明了苏联社会主义制度的优越性。中国科学院应用物理研究所代理所长陆学善指出：原子能工业发电站的发电，意味着动力工程整个生产技术的变革，对共产主义建设起着巨大的作用。原子能工业发电站的发电，再一次向全世界宣告和平民主阵营的愿望：我们要和平，我们正在努力建设美好理想的社会。北京大学物理系主任褚圣麟说：原子能工业发电站的建设，是包含着多方面最近代的科学原理和技术的掌握和最先进的工程设计，而且还需要高度的工业基础。这一成就，证明了苏联的科学工业技术已达到世界第一位。北京大学物理系教授虞福春说：苏联科学这一伟大的成就，使我们清楚地认识到科学一旦掌握到劳动人民的手里，它的发展将无限量。中国的科学工作者，一定会学习苏联的榜样，为祖国的社会主义建设和保卫世界和平而奋斗。
