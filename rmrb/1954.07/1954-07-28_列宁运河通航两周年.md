    Two Years Since the Opening of the Lenin Canal
    By V. Kuchiyanov (Soviet Union)
    For generations, the Russian people have longed to build the Lenin Volga-Don Navigation Canal. It has now been open for two years.

    The Volga-Don Canal is a magnificent complex of structures, used to connect the Volga and Don river basins for shipping, to obtain inexpensive electricity, and to irrigate and water the arid lands of the Stalingrad and Rostov regions.

    On the Volga-Don, a navigable canal with numerous locks and dams, pumping stations, the Karpov and Varvarovka reservoirs, a hydroelectric power station with a generating capacity of 160,000 kilowatts, and the Tsimlyansk Dam with the huge Tsimlyansk freshwater sea have been constructed. Irrigation canals extend in all directions from the Volga-Don Canal, carrying life-giving water to the fields. Now, on the once-barren steppes, transformed by the labor of the Soviet people, orchards are lush and green, and vigorous wheat, vegetable, and melon crops are ripening.

    The Volga-Don Navigation Canal is the most important link in the unified water transport system of the Soviet Union, built during the Soviet era. With the completion of the Volga-Don Canal, the five seas of the European part of the Soviet Union—the White Sea, the Baltic Sea, the Caspian Sea, the Sea of Azov, and the Black Sea—are connected by inland waterways. This predetermines the special importance of the Volga-Don Canal in the Soviet national economy.

    Lenin, the great founder of the Communist Party and the Soviet state, was very concerned about connecting the Don and Volga rivers. Shortly after the victory of the October Socialist Revolution, he pointed out that the future Volga-Don Canal would be a powerful transport lever, which would reverse the economy of the backward southeastern provinces of Russia.

    The Volga-Don Navigation Canal has entered its third navigation season. This canal has made many freight transport tasks easier. Many building materials, industrial products, and agricultural products are transported from the Volga to the Don, or from the Black Sea and Azov Sea areas outwards, no longer needing to go by rail. This frees up tens of thousands of railway cars for transporting other goods.

    For example, previously, Donets coal, when transported to factories in the Volga region, had to first go by rail, then by water, and then by rail again. This was both time-consuming and expensive. Now, Donbas coal can be transported directly by water to the industrial areas of the Volga. And wheat from the left bank of the Volga and the North Caucasus can also be transported directly by water to Moscow, Leningrad, Yaroslavl, Kostroma, Gorky, and other industrial centers.

    In the lower reaches of the Don, there are rich deposits of valuable mineral building materials. Previously, due to the high cost of rail transport, these materials were not transported to the Volga regions far from the Don. With the construction of the Volga-Don waterway, the situation has greatly changed. The cost of transporting mineral building materials by water is several times cheaper than by rail. Now, quarries in the lower reaches of the Don are stepping up their work, and fleets of ships loaded with gravel, lime, and other mineral building materials are constantly heading towards the Volga.

    This year, two new types of cargo have appeared on the Volga-Don Canal: concrete from factories in Novorossiysk and Tuimas oil from Ulyanovsk are being transported to ports in the Sea of Azov.

    Therefore, each navigation season further expands the types of goods transported by the Volga-Don Canal, which connects five seas, and increases the freight volume of the new waterway. In the first half of 1954, the Volga-Don Shipping Company transported 29.4 percent more cargo by tonnage than in the first half of last year, and 40 percent more in terms of ton-kilometers. The transport volume of the Volga-Don Canal itself also increased by 13 percent compared to last year in terms of tonnage. It has exceeded its freight transport plan for the first half of the year by 19 percent in terms of tonnage and 5.5 percent in terms of ton-kilometers.

    In the past few years, the freight volume of the Volga-Don Navigation Canal should increase by about four times compared to the trial navigation period in 1952. In this way, nearly 400,000 railway cars can be saved each year, and the transportation costs of certain goods can be reduced to one-quarter or one-fifth of the current prices!

    The river transport workers of the Volga-Don are actively participating in the nationwide socialist competition to complete and exceed the state transport plan ahead of schedule. They are tirelessly struggling to utilize internal potential and are skillfully adopting all new and progressive methods that have emerged in the socialist competition of maritime and inland waterway workers. A convincing proof of this is the widespread and full promotion of the push-towing method of barges on this waterway, which makes it possible to increase the technical speed of ships by 15 to 25 percent and greatly reduce transportation time and lighten the labor of the crew.

    In the process of socialist competition, technically skilled professional cadres have emerged. Lydia Savinova came to the Volga-Don Canal in 1952 after graduating from the Leningrad Institute of Water Transport Engineering. After she had mastered the experience of operating hydraulic machinery very well, she was appointed as the director of Lock No. 6. Now, Lydia Savinova has become one of the advanced workers of the Lenin Volga-Don Navigation Canal. This ordinary girl from the village of Irobukhzina in the Tatar Republic has become the commander of a complex building equipped with the latest equipment from the motherland.

    Lydia Savinova's path is the path of ordinary Soviet youth.

    With the opening of the Soviet Volga-Don Canal, one of the largest passenger lines in our country, the Moscow-Rostov line, with a total length of 3,267 kilometers, has been opened. In our country, this route was immediately welcomed by the general public and became the favorite route for travelers and those who like to rest on ships.

    Not only do Soviet citizens like to travel on the Volga-Don waterway, but all our friends who come to the Soviet Union from the People's Democratic countries, as well as many guests from capitalist countries, also want to take a fascinating trip on this route.

    The Volga-Don Canal also plays an important role in developing the Soviet Union's foreign trade with the People's Democratic countries in Europe. Most of the goods that the Soviet Union receives from these countries and the goods that the Soviet Union transports to them under the trade agreements concluded with the People's Democratic countries are transported by water.

    The Lenin Volga-Don Navigation Canal, built by the selfless labor of the Soviet people, is victoriously serving the cause of communist construction and the cause of peace. In celebrating the second anniversary of the completion of this magnificent building, the Soviet people are justifiably proud of their glorious Communist Party, which leads them from victory to victory, and proud of their powerful industry, advanced science and technology, which have realized the dream of the Russian people for generations in a short period of time.

    列宁运河通航两周年
    苏联  维·库奇雅诺夫
    俄罗斯人民世世代代渴望建筑的列宁伏尔加河—顿河通航运河已经通航两年了。
    伏尔加河—顿河运河是一个宏伟的复合的建筑物，它被用来沟通伏尔加河和顿河流域的航运，取得廉价的电力，并使斯大林格勒和罗斯托夫两州干旱的土地获得灌溉和引水。
    在伏尔加河—顿河上已建筑了拥有大量的水闸和堤坝的通航运河，抽水站，卡尔波夫和瓦尔瓦罗夫水库，附有发电能力达十六万瓩的水电站和巨大的齐姆良淡水海的齐姆良大堤。灌溉渠道从伏尔加河—顿河运河向四面八方伸延着，它们向田野中运送着使生命复苏的流水。现在，在那已经为苏维埃人的劳动所改造了的、不久前还遭受干旱的空阔草原上，果园已经是绿荫一片，茁壮的小麦、蔬菜和瓜类作物都已成熟了。
    伏尔加河—顿河通航运河是苏维埃政权年代建造的苏联统一水运系统中的最重要的环节。由于伏尔加河—顿河运河的建成，苏联欧洲部分的五个海——白海、波罗的海、里海、亚速海和黑海得以通过我国内陆的水运干线而连接起来。这就预定了伏尔加河—顿河运河在苏联国民经济中的特殊重要作用。
    共产党和苏维埃国家的伟大奠基者列宁曾非常关怀使顿河和伏尔加河连接的问题。在十月社会主义革命胜利之后不久，他就指出未来的伏尔加河—顿河运河将是一个强大的运输杠杆，它将扭转俄罗斯东南部落后各州的经济。
    伏尔加河—顿河通航运河已步入第三航运期。这条运河使很多货运工作变得轻而易举了。许多建筑材料、工业品、农产品由伏尔加河向顿河运输或者从黑海和亚速海各区向外运输，已不再需要经过铁路了。这样就使几万部铁路车皮得以腾出来运送其他货物。
    例如，以前顿尼茨的煤在运往伏尔加河流域各工厂时，必须先经过铁路，然后是水路，然后再经过铁路才能到达。这既浪费时间又使运输成本高昂。现在顿巴斯的煤已可以直接沿着水路运达伏尔加河各工业区。而伏尔加河左岸和北高加索的小麦也可以直接沿着水路运达莫斯科、列宁格勒、雅罗斯拉夫里、科斯特罗马、高尔基和其他工业中心。
    在顿河下游有珍贵的矿物建筑材料的丰富矿藏。以前，由于铁路运输费用昂贵，因此没有把这些材料运往离顿河遥远的伏尔加河流域各区。随着伏尔加河—顿河水路的建成，情况已大大改变。矿物建筑材料的水路运输费用已比铁路运送便宜了好几倍。现在，在顿河下游各采石场正加紧工作，满装石子、石灰和其他矿物建筑材料的船队正连绵不断地向伏尔加河驶去。
    今年在伏尔加河—顿河运河上又出现了两种新货物：把诺沃罗西斯克各工厂的混凝土和来自乌利扬诺夫斯克的土依马斯石油运往亚速海各港口。
    因此，每次航运期都更加扩大了这个连接五个海的伏尔加河—顿河运河的货运种类，提高着新水路的货运量。一九五四年上半年伏尔加河—顿河航运公司所运输的货物，按吨数计算，已比去年上半年增加了百分之二十九点四，在吨公里方面，增加了百分之四十。伏尔加河—顿河运河本身的运输量，照吨数计，也比去年增加了百分之十三。按吨数计算，它已超额百分之十九完成上半年货运计划，按吨公里计算，也已超额百分之五点五。
    最近几年内，伏尔加河—顿河通航运河的货运量，应当较一九五二年试航时期的货运量约增加四倍。这样，每年就会节省出近四十万辆的铁路车皮，并能使某些货物的运输费用降低到等于现有运价的四分之一或五分之一！
    伏尔加河—顿河的河运工作者积极参加了争取提前和超额完成国家运输计划的全民社会主义竞赛。他们正在不倦地为利用内在潜力而斗争，正在巧妙地采用着在海上和内河工作人员社会主义竞赛进程中所出现的一切新的进步方法。在这方面令人信服的明证，就是在这条水运线上已广泛地充分推广了拖带驳船的推顶法，这一方法使我们有可能把船只的技术速度提高百分之十五到二十五，并能大大减少运货时间，减轻船员的劳动。
    在社会主义竞赛的进程中已涌现了技术熟练的专业干部。里吉娅·萨维诺娃于一九五二年从列宁格勒水运工程学院毕业后来到了伏尔加河—顿河运河上。当她很好地掌握了操使水力机械的经验后，就被任命为第六号水闸的主任。现在，里吉娅·萨维诺娃已成为列宁伏尔加河—顿河通航运河的先进工作者之一。这个来自鞑靼共和国伊洛布赫季纳村的普通姑娘，已成为装备有祖国最新设备的复杂建筑物的指挥员了。
    里吉娅·萨维诺娃的道路，就是一般苏联青年人的道路。
    随着苏联伏尔加河—顿河运河的通航，已开辟了我国最大客运线之一，全长达三千二百六十七公里的莫斯科——罗斯托夫线。在我国，这条线路立刻受到广大公众的欢迎，并成为旅行家和喜欢在船上休养的人所最喜爱的线路。
    不仅是苏联公民喜欢在伏尔加河—顿河水路上旅行，而且所有从人民民主国家来苏联的我们的朋友，以及从资本主义各国来的很多客人，也都想在这条线路上作一次引人入胜的旅行。
    在发展苏联同欧洲各人民民主国家的对外贸易方面，伏尔加河—顿河运河也起着重要的作用。苏联根据同人民民主国家所缔结的贸易协定，从这些国家收到的大部分货物和由苏联运给它们的货物，都是经水路运输的。
    由苏联人民的忘我劳动所建造的列宁伏尔加河—顿河通航运河正在胜利地为共产主义建设事业与和平事业服务。在庆祝这个宏伟的建筑落成的二周年中，苏联人理所当然地要为引导他们从胜利走向胜利的自己的光荣的共产党而自豪，为自己那能在短期间实现了俄罗斯人民世代梦想的建筑的强大的工业、先进的科学和技术而自豪。
