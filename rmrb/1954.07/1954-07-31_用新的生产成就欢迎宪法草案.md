    Welcome the Draft Constitution with New Production Achievements
    Cherish Public Property
    The draft constitution has inspired the production enthusiasm and patriotic labor fervor of the workers at the third mine of the state-owned Yangquan Coal Mine. On the evening of June 26th, at 10 o'clock, there was heavy rain, and the section from the pit entrance to the south yard was flooded. To ensure safe production, the leadership immediately instructed that coal transportation on the bridge be stopped. At this time, the workers of the 12th transportation team discovered wood floating in the water under the bridge. They thought that this might be the pit props and bridge pillars unloaded from the train onto the riverbank during the day. Propagandist Ma Zhibao said to everyone, "A piece of wood is worth tens of thousands of yuan, it's state property! The draft constitution also has a clause about this: every citizen has the duty to cherish and protect public property. We workers are the masters of the country, we should find a way to salvage the wood." Other workers echoed, "Right, we can't just watch the people's property being lost. While we're not working, let's go salvage it." So everyone rushed to the shore with tools to pull the wood. Around 1 o'clock, the water receded slightly, and three workers volunteered to take off their clothes and go into the water to salvage. More than thirty people on the shore received and carried the wood. By 2 o'clock, they had salvaged 176 large and small pit props. At this tense moment, the bell for coal transportation rang. To ensure that both production and rescuing state property were not delayed, the transportation team decided to send seven comrades to continue salvaging wood, while the others shared the entire transportation task. They chased along the water while salvaging, unknowingly reaching the Xiaonankeng, five miles away. They forgot their fatigue, the mud, and the cold of the late night. Finally, they salvaged another 67 large and small pieces of wood. They only stopped working when the river water receded and no more wood could be seen. By this time, the east was already turning white.
    Find More Tricks, Think of More Ways
    In July, the sun was scorching hot. The workers of the Jiang Hengde riveting team in the forging workshop of the Shanxi Machine Factory, seemed to be oblivious to the heat, operating electric drills and wielding hammers, working hard to produce new products. People in the factory often give them a thumbs up and say: "Since the announcement of the draft constitution, the Jiang Hengde team's production enthusiasm has been really high. They have set a plan to complete the July production task 15 days ahead of schedule. This is really the first of its kind in our Shanxi Machine Factory!"
    In July, the Jiang Hengde team had to manufacture parts for ten 100-meter drilling machines, parts for forty-eight cotton-absorbing machines, and one and a half screening machines. This task was very heavy. During the discussion of the draft constitution, the team members decided to launch a technical innovation movement to overcome the difficulties in production. In the past, the division of labor within the team was not clear. Today one person would drill holes, and tomorrow they would do scribing work. At the same time, the tools in the team were thrown around haphazardly, and much time was often wasted searching for tools during work. In response to this situation, the team divided the work according to the type of work and the level of technical proficiency, fixing each person's work, and assigning a special person to be responsible for managing the tools. This overcame the chaos. They also divided into three mutual aid groups and launched a labor competition. In this way, there were really more people and more ideas, and many tricks appeared. Young worker Zhang Debao made a template to replace the bending ruler for scribing, which increased the efficiency of scribing by three times. Veteran worker Hu Chengye used a pressure lever to press iron plates into iron grooves, which was much less laborious than hammering, and shortened the working hours. Veteran worker Wu Liansheng made a punching tool, which increased production efficiency by three times.
    Strive for Greater Achievements
      Tunnel No. 20 is the most arduous project in the Fengtai-Shacheng railway construction project. All the workers of the third squad of the second engineering team of the first tunnel engineering office, in the discussion of the draft constitution, realized that they must adopt the attitude of masters, find tricks, and improve work efficiency. In the past, when the Yang Jinshan team of the pilot tunnel work班打水眼时, the blasting holes often had water in them, causing the explosives to get damp and misfire. In addition, the preparatory work before work was not sufficient, and the wind drill could not be turned on in time when the wind came. After everyone's research, the entire team rationally divided the work: two people prepared the water for打水眼, two people carried the wind drill, two people carried the drill bit, two people sorted out the wind pipe. As soon as they went to work, they did these things well, and they could pick up the wind drill and start drilling when the wind came. At the same time, they used a wind pipe to blow the water out of the blasting holes to avoid misfires. The team's work efficiency increased from 0.9 meters per nine hours in the pilot tunnel to 1.4 meters. The Sun Wenkun team of the expansion work班 launched a labor competition and improved the process of oiling the wind drill. The whole team selected all the blasting holes to be drilled before work. In this way, the number of blasting holes drilled by each wind drill per shift increased from fifteen or six in the past to twenty to twenty-two. Workers in the An Fengqi team of the transportation team, in the discussion of the draft constitution, had a particularly deep understanding of today's happy life. They guaranteed that there would be no stone slag in the pilot tunnel. Through the continuous efforts of all the comrades, the working methods were improved. Now, the workers building Tunnel No. 20 are expressing their welcome to the draft constitution by striving for greater production achievements.
    The Birth of New Tools
    The workers of a bricklaying team on a construction site in Shenyang encountered a technical difficulty during construction: the project required the wall to be built into a fan-shaped wall with a 30-degree slope (because the windows opened inward). This required cutting one corner of the brick into a 70-degree plane. Everyone was worried about this: "What should we do? After the draft constitution was announced, many workers in other places have made significant work achievements. We have also made a guarantee to the construction workers of the city to reduce construction costs by 12% and save the country 1.1 billion yuan. Can we just talk big?" A look of contemplation appeared on everyone's face. "Worrying is useless, we have to come up with a solution!" thought Zhong Shengzhen, the chairman of the trade union. He said to everyone: "We workers should not worry about a little difficulty in our work. Everyone should actively think of ways to find tricks. This is the practical action of welcoming the draft constitution." So everyone focused their energy on research. Zhong Shengzhen thought that if he only cut from one side, the brick would easily break. If he put something under it and used that shock, maybe it would work. So he borrowed an old kitchen knife from the kitchen, put a small hammer under the brick, and smashed it from above with the back of the knife. Sure enough, a piece of brick was cut off neatly. Zhong Shengzhen was extremely happy. He hurried to the work area office, asked the technician to help him draw a picture, and asked the furnace worker to make a tool for him. The next day, the brick-cutting tool was made, and the workers could cut each brick neatly, like cutting tofu. Everyone could not contain their inner joy and happily said, "This time we have something to offer as a gift to the draft constitution."
      A Precious Gift
    Song Zongxian, an advanced worker in the mechanical section of the Dalian Alkali Factory, and his partners accepted an urgent task of manufacturing "Walu boards" for the large cars in the No. 2 workshop, with a deadline of one month. When the section chief handed over this task to Song Zongxian, he said: "This is a major and critical issue for the whole factory at present. You must find a way to solve it." Song Zongxian also knew that this was not a simple matter, but he agreed without hesitation: "Don't worry, I will overcome the difficulties and complete the task." On the same day, Song Zongxian improved the broaching tool according to the shape of the "Walu board" holes. However, because the holes were small and the tool holder was thin, it would tremble as soon as it was applied. He modified two tools in a row, but neither could be used, and not a single hole could be broached. He wanted to study the matter thoroughly, so he ran to find the lathe worker Zou Benfu, and the two of them studied and made a broaching die together. With the die, the tool still couldn't be used, and after broaching for a long time, not a single hole was broached. This was a really awkward situation.
    On June 24th, Song Zongxian took advantage of the lunch break to hold a forum with his partners. He said: "After the draft constitution was announced, I made up my mind to welcome the draft constitution with practical actions. We must make the 'Walu boards' to ensure timely supply for production needs and not stop the large cars. Does anyone have any suggestions?" Everyone was excited when they heard this and agreed with Lao Song's opinion. After collective discussion and research, they finally decided to use the pressure method to make the "Walu boards."
    Because the "Walu board" was made of white steel, the material for making the pressure die was also very hard. After Song Zongxian broached the square holes in the die, Jiang Yongchang took it to file, which was very laborious. Apprentice miller Li Kaicheng helped him mill it out on his milling machine in a very short time. In this way, with everyone's support and help, the die was made on July 3rd.
    The experiment began. The section chief and the branch secretary watched the workers pressing and calculated the time. It took less than ten minutes to press a "Walu board." Compared with the past, the production efficiency was increased by nine and a half times. But the workers were not satisfied with this achievement. Jiang Zhifa also proposed the idea of a die that could press three holes at a time.

    用新的生产成就欢迎宪法草案
    爱护公共财产
    宪法草案鼓舞了国营阳泉煤矿第三矿工人们的生产积极性和爱国主义的劳动热情。六月二十六日晚十点钟，下着大雨，由坑口到南场的地段发了大水。领导方面为了保证安全生产，立即指示桥上停止运煤。这时，第十二搬运组的工人发现桥下的水里漂着木头。大家一想，这可能是白天从火车上卸到河岸上的坑木和桥柱。宣传员马智保对大家说：“一根木头要值好几万元，这是国家的财产呀！宪法草案上也有这一条：每个公民都有爱护和保卫公共财产的义务，咱们工人是国家的主人，应当想办法把木材捞上来。”其他工人同志也同声说：“对，咱们不能眼看着人民的财产受损失，趁现在没工作，咱们去捞吧。”于是大家争先恐后地拿着工具往岸上扒木头。将近一点钟的时候，水势稍退，三个工人自告奋勇地脱了衣服下水去捞，岸上的三十多个人接的接抬的抬，到两点钟时已经捞出大小坑木一百七十六根。在这紧张的时刻，开始运煤的电铃响了。为了使生产和抢救国家财产的工作两不误，搬运组里决定抽出七个同志继续捞木头，其他人分担全部运输任务。他们一边顺水追，一边捞，不知不觉到了五里地以外的小南坑边上；他们忘记了劳累、泥泞、深夜的寒冷。最后又捞出了六十七根大小木头。等河水退去，再也看不到木头时，他们才停止工作。这时东方已经有些发白了。
    多找窍门，多想办法
    七月里，太阳热辣辣的。山西机器厂锻工车间蒋恒德铆工组的工人，好像不知道什么是热似的，开动着电钻，抡着锤头，为赶制新产品而紧张地工作着。厂里常常有人翘起大拇指这样说：“宪法草案公布以后，蒋恒德小组生产劲头可真大，他们订出提前十五天完成七月份生产任务的计划，这在咱们山西机器厂说来，真是头一份！”
    蒋恒德小组在七月份内要制造十部百公尺钻探机的零件、四十八部吸棉机的部分零件和一部半筛料机。这个任务是很重的，组员们在讨论宪法草案中，决定开展技术革新运动，来克服生产上的困难。过去，组内分工不明确，今天这个人打眼，明天又去干号眼的活；同时，组里的工具乱扔乱放，每天干活时往往为了找工具耽误很多时间。针对这种情况，按工作的种类和技术的熟练程度，进行了分工，把每个人的工作固定下来，同时指定专人负责管理工具，这样就克服了混乱现象。他们又划分了三个互助组，展开劳动竞赛。这么一来，真是人多办法多，出现了许多窍门。青年工人张得保做了一个样板代替弯尺来号眼，使号眼的效率提高了三倍。老工人胡成业利用压杠将铁板压成铁槽，比较用锤来打要省力得多，而且缩短了工时。老工人武连生制了一个冲眼工具，使生产效率提高三倍。
    争取更大的成绩
      二十号隧道，是丰（台）沙（城）线建筑工程中最艰巨的工程。第一隧道工程处第二工程队三分队的全体工人，在讨论宪法草案中，都认识到必须抱着主人翁的态度，找窍门，提高工作效率。导峒工班的杨金山小组，过去打水眼时，炮眼内往往有水，使炸药受潮发生瞎炮的现象；另外，上班前准备工作做的不够，风来时不能按时开风钻。经过大家研究以后，全组工人合理地分了工：两人准备打水眼用的水，两人扛风钻，两人扛钻头，两人整理风管，一上班就把这些工作作好，风一来就可以拿起风钻开始打眼；同时，用风管把炮眼内的水吹出来，避免瞎炮的现象。小组的工作效率，便由原来每九小时进导峒零点九公尺提高到一点四公尺。扩大工班的孙文坤小组，开展了劳动竞赛，改进了给风钻上油的工序，全组在上班前就把所要打的炮眼一齐选好。这样就由过去每一工班时每台风钻打十五、六个炮眼提高到打二十到二十二个炮眼。运输队安凤岐小组工人，在讨论宪法草案当中，对今天的幸福生活体会得特别深刻，他们保证导峒内不存石碴。经过全组同志的不断努力，改进了工作方法。现在，建筑二十号隧道的工人们，正以争取更大的生产成绩来表示他们对宪法草案的欢迎。
    新工具的诞生
    沈阳某工地瓦工组的工人们，在施工当中遇到了一个技术上的困难：工程要求把墙建成三十度坡的扇面墙（因为窗子是往里开的）。这就需要把砖的一角，削成七十度的平面。大家都为此发愁了：“怎么办呢？宪法草案公布后，别处的工人很多都有了显著的工作成绩，我们也向全市建筑工人做了保证，要降低施工成本百分之十二，为国家节约资金十一亿元，我们能说空话吗？”每个人的脸上都流露出沉思的颜色。“发愁是没有用的，总得想出个道来才行！”工会主席钟声振想。他向大家说：我们工人不应该为工作中的一点小困难发愁，大家应该积极想办法找窍门，这才是欢迎宪法草案的实际行动。”于是大家集中精力进行研究。钟声振想，光是从一面打，砖容易碎裂，若是下面垫点东西，利用那个震劲儿，也许差不多。于是他向厨房借把旧菜刀，把小锤子垫在砖下面，用刀背在上面一砸，砖头果然被溜齐的切下一块来。钟声振高兴极啦。他急忙到工区办公室，请技术员帮他绘一张图，又请烘炉工赶着给他做工具。第二天，切砖工具做成了，工人们可以像切豆腐一样，整齐地把每块砖切开来。大家都按不住内心的喜悦，高兴地说：“这回我们可有东西作为给宪法草案的献礼了。”
      珍贵的献礼
    大连碱厂机械科先进工作者宋宗显和他的伙伴们接受了一批制造二号车间大车上用的“瓦鲁板”的紧急任务，期限要在一个月内完成。科长把这批任务交给宋宗显时说：“这是目前全厂的重大关键问题，你一定要想办法解决它。”宋宗显也知道，这不是一件简单的事，但是他却一口答应了：“放心吧，我会克服困难完成任务的。”宋宗显当天就根据“瓦鲁板”眼的形状把插刀改进了一下。可是因为眼小用的刀杆子细，一上刀就发颤，一连改了两把刀都不能用，一刀也插不下来。他想研究个究竟，就跑去把车工邹本甫找来，两个人一起研究又做了一付插胎。有了胎具，刀具还是利用不上，插了半天也没有插出一个眼来，这可是件别扭事。
    六月二十四日，宋宗显趁着中午休息时间，和伙伴们开了一个座谈会。他说：“宪法草案公布以后，我就下了决心要用实际行动欢迎宪法草案，一定要把‘瓦鲁板’做出来，保证及时供给生产的需要，不使大车停下来，大家有什么意见？”大家一听都兴奋起来了，同意老宋的意见。经过集体的讨论和研究，最后就决定用压力压的办法来做“瓦鲁板”。
    因为“瓦鲁板”是白钢的，所以做压力胎的材料也很硬，宋宗显把胎眼的方形插出来后，姜永昌就拿去锉，锉起来很吃力，铣床子徒工李开成就帮助他在自己的铣床子上用很短的时间把它铣了出来。就这样在大家的支持和帮助下，在七月三日做好了胎具。
    试验开始了，科长和支部书记一边看着工人压，一边计算时间。压一个“瓦鲁板”还用不到十分钟。和过去相比较，整整提高了生产效率九倍半。但是工人们没有满足这个成绩，姜志发又提出了一次压三个眼的胎具的意见。
