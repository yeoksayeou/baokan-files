    Anshan Workers Enthusiastically Save
    The number of people participating in savings in Anshan is increasing daily. At the end of last year, the city's people's savings reached 18.9 billion yuan, of which more than 90 percent were workers' deposits. This figure is four times the savings amount at the end of 1952 and 18 times more than at the end of 1949. To facilitate savings for citizens, the Anshan Branch of the People's Bank of China has widely established small savings institutions. According to statistics in June of this year, there are more than 40 savings service stations in the city, distributed in major department stores, collective dormitories, canteens, streets, and night markets. The branch also regularly sends people to various government agencies, factories, mines, and dormitories to handle savings business.
    Starting in July, the Anshan Branch of the People's Bank of China has also launched a new "Deposit Small Sums Regularly and Withdraw a Lump Sum with Prizes Savings" program. From mid-June, the branch organized a propaganda team of more than 300 people to publicize this new savings business in various factories, mines, government agencies, and streets. By the end of June, more than 20,000 households (40,000 yuan per household) had already made reservations to participate in the "Deposit Small Sums Regularly and Withdraw a Lump Sum with Prizes Savings" program.

    鞍山职工踊跃储蓄
    鞍山市参加储蓄的人数日益增多。去年年底，该市人民的储蓄额达一百八十九亿元，其中百分之九十以上是职工的存款。这个数字等于一九五二年年底储蓄额的四倍，比一九四九年年底增加十八倍。为了便利市民储蓄，中国人民银行鞍山市分行广泛设置了小型储蓄机构。据今年六月份的统计，全市共有四十多处储蓄服务所，分布在各大百货商店、集体宿舍、食堂、街道和夜市等地。该行还经常派人到各机关、工厂、矿山和宿舍办理储蓄业务。
    中国人民银行鞍山市分行从七月份开始，又新举办了一种“零存整取有奖储蓄”。从六月中旬起，该行组织了三百多人的宣传队，深入各工厂、矿山、机关和街道宣传了这项新储蓄业务。到六月末，预约参加“零存整取有奖储蓄”的已有二万多户（每户四万元）。（曲六功）
