Xinhua News Agency, 2nd. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China issued a statement regarding the fabricated report presented by the United States government representative at the United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs in May 1954, which slandered the government of the People's Republic of China for privately trafficking drugs abroad:

    During the meeting of the United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs in May 1954, the United States government representative made a speech slandering China for formulating a so-called twenty-year plan to spread drugs abroad, and selling large quantities of heroin and opium to the United States, Japan, and South Korea. This statement by the United States government representative is a complete fabrication.

    Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the ruling clique of the United States has consistently adopted a hostile policy towards our government and people. The representatives of the United States government attending the United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs and the Economic and Social Council meetings take this opportunity every year to fabricate groundless slanders and smears against the People's Republic of China on the issue of drug prohibition. Our relevant departments have repeatedly refuted this and pointed out that the purpose of the United States government in creating such lies is to divert the attention of the people of the world and attempt to cover up the United States government's acts of aggression in Asia. As far as drug trafficking is concerned, on January 28, 1953, a spokesman for the US military Far East Command openly admitted that many American soldiers were privately hoarding and selling narcotics in South Korea. According to the facts admitted by the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare on September 16 of the same year, many American military personnel stationed in Japan have drug addictions, and many incidents of private drug trafficking occur near US military barracks. The drugs manufactured in Japan under the control of the United States are not only sold domestically, but are also smuggled to Hong Kong and Southeast Asia by some people. In fact, it is the United States government itself that is pursuing a policy of poisoning in the United States, Japan, South Korea, and other places.

    Recently, at the Geneva Conference, our delegation, based on the just stand of safeguarding Asian and world peace and the equality of national sovereignty, fully demonstrated its sincerity in consultation and made great efforts for the cause of peace. However, the United States government, which fears consultation and peace, has adopted a hostile attitude towards this. The United States government's renewed slander against China regarding the so-called drug trafficking at this time is precisely an attempt to confuse the public, damage China's international reputation, and cover up the continued implementation of the United States' aggressive policies. This attempt is, of course, futile.

    The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China promulgated the "Circular on Strictly Prohibiting Opium and Narcotics" and the "Promulgation Order on the Provisional Regulations on the Management of Narcotics" in 1950, and has long banned the planting, manufacturing, use, and sale of opium and other drugs throughout the country. The facts are so obvious that the United States government's nonsense is self-defeating.

    The government and people of the People's Republic of China express serious protest against the malicious slander made by the United States government representative at the United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs. We firmly believe that this absurd lie will be completely bankrupt under the condemnation of the just people of the world.

### 美国在联合国麻醉药品委员会无耻诬蔑我国私贩毒品  我外交部发表声明抗议美国的恶毒诽谤

    美国在联合国麻醉药品委员会无耻诬蔑我国私贩毒品
    我外交部发表声明抗议美国的恶毒诽谤
   【新华社二日讯】中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部就一九五四年五月美国政府代表在联合国麻醉药品委员会上提出诬蔑我中华人民共和国政府向国外私贩毒品的捏造报告发表声明如下：
    一九五四年五月联合国麻醉药品委员会开会时，美国政府代表发言诽谤我国制定了所谓向国外散布毒品二十年计划，对美国、日本、南朝鲜大量出售海洛英和鸦片毒品。美国政府代表这一发言是彻头彻尾的捏造。
    自中华人民共和国成立以来，美国统治集团对我国政府和人民一贯采取敌视的政策。美国政府出席联合国麻醉药品委员会与经济与社会理事会会议的代表每年借此时机就禁毒问题对中华人民共和国进行无中生有的诽谤和诬蔑。对此我有关方面已迭加驳斥，并指出美国政府制造这种谎言的目的是在转移世界人民的注意，企图掩盖美国政府在亚洲进行侵略的行为。就贩卖毒品而言，一九五三年一月二十八日美军远东总司令部发言人就曾公开承认，许多美国军人在南朝鲜私藏和贩卖麻醉品。根据同年九月十六日日本厚生省所承认的事实，许多驻日本的美国军事人员都有吸毒嗜好，私贩毒品事件有许多发生在美军营房附近。在美国控制下的日本所制造的毒品不仅在国内销售，而且也有人私运到香港及东南亚各地。事实上，正是美国政府自己在美国、日本、南朝鲜等地推行着毒化政策。
    最近在日内瓦会议上，我国代表团本着维护亚洲和世界和平和民族主权平等的正义立场，充分显示了协商诚意，为和平事业作了巨大努力。但畏惧协商与和平的美国政府却对此采取敌视。美国政府在这时候再次对我国进行关于所谓贩卖毒品的诽谤，正是企图混淆视听，中伤我国的国际声望和掩护美国侵略政策的继续推行。这种企图当然是徒劳的。
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府在一九五○年就颁布了“关于严禁鸦片烟毒的通令”和“关于管理麻醉药品暂行条例的公布令”，并且早已在全国范围内禁绝了鸦片等毒品的种植、制造、使用和贩卖。事实是如此明显，美国政府的谰言是不攻自破的。
    中华人民共和国的政府和人民对美国政府代表在联合国麻醉药品委员会上的恶毒诽谤表示严重抗议。我们坚信，这种无稽谎言在世界公正人民的谴责下，必将遭到彻底破产。
                一九五四年七月二日于北京
