    Tibetan Primary School on the Grassland
    Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhang Jian
    On the lush green grassland south of Jiegu City, the capital of the Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Region in Qinghai Province, new buildings surrounded by red walls stand. This is the Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Region Complete Primary School. Here, there are spacious classrooms, an auditorium, a library, and dormitories. The front and back of the school building and the surroundings of the courtyard are covered with verdant grass and dense small woods. The children affectionately call the school "Children's Paradise."
    Not long ago, I visited this Tibetan primary school. Groups of elementary school students were scattered on the grass and in the woods, some reciting Tibetan, some dancing, singing, and playing ball. Last year, at the autonomous region's dance performance, the students' dances won the championship. In front of the classroom, a group of elementary school students are planting vegetables and flowers. A child wearing a red scarf said to me in not very fluent Mandarin: The motherland has brought us a happy life. We must build our school well and make it more lovely.
    The primary school has one hundred and twenty boys and girls and five teachers. Lower grade students mainly study Tibetan, and Tibetan lessons account for half of the entire curriculum. In the fifth and sixth grades, subjects such as nature, history, and geography are added. Teachers give students a current affairs report every week, reporting on the achievements of the motherland's economic construction, and then the children discuss it. In the discussions, the children expressed their future ideals and aspirations: some want to be soldiers defending the motherland in the future, and some want to be engineers, doctors, and people's teachers, actively participating in the construction of the motherland. In recent years, many graduates of this school have entered the Qinghai Provincial Intermediate Health School and the Animal Husbandry Training Class to learn specialized techniques.

### 草滩上的藏族小学

    草滩上的藏族小学
    新华社记者　张坚
    在青海省玉树藏族自治区首府结古市南面翠绿的草滩上，红色的围墙环绕着一幢幢新的建筑物，这就是玉树藏族自治区完全小学。这里有宽敞的教室、礼堂、图书馆和宿舍，校舍的前后和院子周围长着碧绿的草和茂密的小树林。孩子们亲热地称呼学校是“儿童乐园。”
    不久以前，记者访问了这所藏族小学校。一群群的小学生正散布在草地上和树林中，有的念着藏文，有的在跳舞、唱歌、打球。去年自治区举行舞蹈表演会，这些学生的舞蹈曾经荣获冠军。在教室的前面，一群小学生正在种菜种花。一个带红领巾的孩子用不十分熟练的汉话向我说：祖国给我们带来了幸福的生活，我们要好好建设我们的学校，使它变得更可爱。
    小学校里有一百二十个男女学生和五个教师。低年级学生主要学习藏文，藏文课占全部课程的一半，五、六年级增加自然、历史、地理等课目。教师们每周要给学生作一次时事报告，报告祖国经济建设的成就，然后由孩子们进行讨论。孩子们在讨论中都表示了自己将来的理想和愿望：有的今后要作保卫祖国的战士，有的要作工程师、医生和人民教师，积极参加祖国的建设事业。几年来，这个学校已有不少毕业生进入青海省中级卫生学校和畜牧训练班，学习专门的技术。
