Realizing the National Budget is in the Best Interests of the People
Ge Zhida

    The 1954 national budget has been approved by the 31st meeting of the Central People's Government Committee. The sources of income and allocation of expenditures in this budget fully reflect the requirements of the general task during the transition period and the desire of the people across the country for peaceful construction. The main source of funds for the national budget is revenue from the state-owned economy, which accounts for 63.58% of the total annual national budget revenue. The proportion paid by farmers has decreased relatively, accounting for only 13.43%; the proportion paid by private industrial and commercial enterprises accounts for 15.40%. The allocation of national budget funds includes economic construction, social and cultural undertakings, consolidating national defense, and necessary administrative expenditures. Expenditures for economic construction and social and cultural undertakings account for more than 60% of the total annual budget expenditure. In particular, investment in the development of heavy industry accounts for approximately 78.3% of the total industrial investment. This shows that the arrangement of the national budget prioritizes concentrating financial resources on the development of heavy industry, while also taking into account other economic construction and the people's material and cultural life and social welfare. Chairman Mao said: "The national budget is a major issue, reflecting the entire national policy, because it stipulates the scope and direction of government activities." [Note 1] Since the national budget reflects all activities of the national economy, it is closely related to the people of the whole country. On the one hand, the realization of this budget will further bring huge benefits to the people of our country, such as: the total value of industrial and agricultural output will increase by 12.6% compared to 1953, the average wage of employees in state-owned enterprises, cultural and educational departments, and state organs will increase by 5.2%, social purchasing power will increase by 13.8%, the worker-peasant alliance will be further consolidated, and national defense capabilities will continue to be strengthened. On the other hand, ensuring the realization of the budget also gives all state organs, enterprise departments, employees of cultural and educational units, and all the people a glorious duty and a major responsibility, which is to: comprehensively complete and over-fulfill the 1954 national economic plan, increase production, improve quality, and reduce costs; actively abide by the law and enthusiastically pay taxes; practice strict economy and oppose extravagance and waste; strengthen financial supervision and abide by financial discipline.
    However, not everyone understands the national budget in this way. For example, some people see that the supply of certain consumer goods is currently insufficient and feel that "the lack of consumer goods is because there is too little investment in light industry," or "too many consumer goods are being exported." Therefore, they doubt whether the investment ratio in the national budget is reasonable.
    This idea is obviously incorrect. First of all, the state's investment in the production of light industry and agriculture is increasing year by year. Under the premise of ensuring investment in heavy industry, in order to appropriately meet the people's growing needs for daily consumer goods, this year the state's investment in light industry and the textile industry has increased by 47.86% and 100.19% respectively compared to the previous year; investment in agriculture, forestry, and water conservancy has increased fivefold compared to 1950. Judging from the production of major consumer goods, the proportion of production in 1954 is expected to increase as follows compared to 1950: cotton cloth more than doubled, oilseeds more than 40%, grain about 50%, and live pigs will increase by about 33% compared to pre-war levels. The output of major products of state-owned light industry in 1953, such as paper, cigarettes, edible salt, sugar, rubber shoes, and medicines, also increased by one and a half times compared to 1950. The planned output of major light industrial products in 1954 will increase by 23.2% for sugar, 16.6% for cigarettes, and 14% for paper compared to the previous year.
    Secondly, the proportion of consumer goods exports is very small. For example, this year the planned export volume of live pigs only accounts for 3% of the total output, and the planned export of edible oil (including oilseeds) will decrease by nearly one-third compared to the previous year; while the consumption of people's livelihoods is increasing year by year. In the past, farmers couldn't get enough to eat or wear warm clothes. Today, they not only have enough coarse grains to eat, but also fine grains, and they can not only wear coarse cloth, but also new patterned clothes. The lives of workers have also been further improved. In 1953, the wage income of workers in state-owned factories increased by 65% to 130% compared to 1949; living conditions are also gradually improving. The workers' dormitories built in 1952 and 1953 can accommodate more than one million people. In the past, only a few urban employees went to the theater or movies, but today, people are queuing to buy tickets precisely because too many people are watching.
    From the above, it can be explained that production has increased greatly, but the increase in demand is even faster. The phenomenon that the supply of certain consumer goods cannot meet the demand is mainly due to the general improvement of people's living standards and the substantial increase in consumption. This is not a bad phenomenon, but rather reflects the increase in people's purchasing power and the improvement of welfare. In 1953, the first year of our country's large-scale economic construction's first five-year plan, the national budget expenditure was more than 21.3 trillion yuan. This year, the national budget expenditure has increased to more than 24.9 trillion yuan. Because our budget is taken from the people and used for the people, all these funds, whether used for capital construction, working capital, cultural and educational undertakings, administrative expenses, national defense construction, or even overseas orders, ultimately increase the people's purchasing power. In 1953, social purchasing power increased by about 20% compared to 1952, and in 1954 it will increase by 13.8% compared to 1953. This is the root cause of the shortage of consumer goods. So the problem lies in the expansion of national budget expenditures, the development of production, and the increase in the income of working people, which has increased purchasing power and the need for consumer goods. The phenomenon that the speed of this consumption growth always runs ahead of the speed of production growth precisely demonstrates the fundamental superiority of the socialist economic system and is the result of revolutionary victory. Comrade Stalin once said:
  "The increase in the consumption (purchasing power) of our Soviet masses always outpaces the expansion of production and drives production forward; in the case of capitalists, the situation is exactly the opposite, the increase in the consumption (purchasing power) of the masses always falls behind the expansion of production, thus turning production into panic. That's the reason why." [Note 2]
    Furthermore, it is impossible to fully develop agriculture and light industry without first developing heavy industry. At present, my country's agricultural production is decentralized and backward, the rate of production increase is slow, and the commodity rate (the proportion of the total output of a certain agricultural product that is sold on the market as a commodity) is very low. Without first developing heavy industry to supply agriculture with machinery and equipment and a large amount of chemical fertilizers, the improvement of agricultural production is limited. At the same time, the raw materials for light industry, such as cotton for textiles, sugar cane for sugar making, oilseeds for oil extraction, and tobacco leaves for cigarettes, are all supplied by rural areas. Currently, the biggest problem is the insufficient supply of raw materials. Machines cannot be fully utilized. The more investment in light industry, the more insufficient raw materials are felt. Moreover, even if raw materials are sufficient, it is impossible to fully develop light industry without accelerating the development of heavy industry to equip light industry with machinery.
    Conversely, since we cannot produce it ourselves, can we import more light industrial products and agricultural products? This is also not possible. Doing so would make us like the farmer described by Comrade Stalin:
  "He has accumulated some money, but instead of using this money to repair the plow and renovate his economy, he bought a large gramophone... and went bankrupt as a result." [Note 3] Of course, the people will not agree to such a practice.
    So where is the way out? It is to adhere to the policy of first concentrating financial resources on the development of heavy industry, while also taking into account other economic construction and the people's material, cultural and welfare undertakings. The 1954 national budget fully reflects this requirement. Therefore, ensuring the completion of the national budget is in the best interests of all the people. To ensure the completion of the national budget, we should strive to "increase production, practice economy, and reserve more reserves" in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions. As everyone knows, the potential for increasing production in our country is very large. If state-owned enterprises improve labor productivity and reduce costs, they can increase a large amount of products for the country and accumulate a lot of funds. If private enterprises make full use of existing equipment, they can also increase many products for the country. Agriculture and handicrafts can increase production a lot as long as they are organized. There are many people and abundant resources in China. As long as everyone takes action, they can increase a lot of social wealth. Take farmers as an example. If each household raises one more chicken, they can produce an additional 10 billion eggs each year. The so-called "brothers and sisters united in heart, yellow soil turns into gold" is the truth. At the same time, we must practice strict economy. From the perspective of the national economy, the measures adopted by the People's Government to plan the purchase and supply of edible oil and grain are one of the important methods of saving, which is to concentrate the produced goods by the state for planned distribution and supply, so that those in need can get appropriate satisfaction. There are many ways to save. For example, in enterprises, we must save raw materials, reduce miscellaneous expenses, and reduce costs; in terms of administrative expenses, we must streamline institutions and save expenses. In addition, we must also carry out mass savings. Due to the large population of our country, carrying out mass savings has special significance. For example, if each person in the country saves one or two liang of rice per day, more than 10 billion catties can be saved each year; if each person saves one chi of cloth per year, six million bolts of cloth can be saved, enough for 30 million people to wear for a year; if the population of the 99 large and medium-sized cities in the country eats one or two less pork per month, more than 15,000 tons of pork can be saved in a year. If this pork is exported, it can be exchanged for more than 75,000 tons of steel or 1,500 tractors; if each person in the country eats ten fewer eggs per year, more than 6 billion eggs can be saved, which can be exported to exchange for more than 2.9 million tons of fertilizer. Therefore, saving consumption is of great benefit to accelerating my country's industrial construction. During the period when the Soviet people were fighting for the socialist industrialization of the country, they were "willing to endure sacrifices, implement extreme savings in all aspects, save on food, save on education expenses, save on cloth, in order to accumulate the necessary funds to establish industry." [Note 4] We must learn from the spirit of hard work of the Soviet people.
    At present, there are also examples of understanding the national budget from a one-sided point of view: some industrialists and businessmen have gained a lot of benefits under the state's correct economic policies, and they express their support; but on the other hand, the phenomenon of tax evasion is still quite serious. A small number of farmers are very satisfied with the construction of farmland water conservancy, the development of mutual assistance and cooperation, and the increase of agricultural loans; but they have some concerns about paying public grain, especially selling surplus grain to the state. There are also some cadres and even responsible persons of some state-owned enterprises who make many demands on the state. When the state allocates technical equipment and working capital to the enterprises under their management, their enthusiasm is very high; but after they get these things in their hands, they show an irresponsible and negligent attitude towards state assets, blindly construct, the quality is poor, or the state funds are invested in idle and stockpiled materials, which cannot be effective in time; some even waste extravagantly, do not pay attention to economic accounting, do not turn over profits and depreciation funds on time, and occupy large amounts of funds that should be paid to the national budget for a long time. All these phenomena must be opposed.
    All the people should realize that ensuring the implementation of the national budget and striving for the national financial plan to achieve more income than expenditure and maintain more reserves is our common glorious and arduous task of struggle. Therefore, we must implement the spirit of increasing production and practicing economy into everyone's work and life; we should put the interests of socialist construction at the apex of our activities; small interests should be subordinate to large interests; current interests should be subordinate to long-term interests; promote the spirit of hard work, and establish an overall idea of ​​obeying the national plan in production and consumption. Only when all the people have a high sense of responsibility for the execution of the national budget can the victorious realization of the national budget be most reliably guaranteed.

    实现国家预算是人民的最大利益
    葛致达
      一九五四年国家预算已经中央人民政府委员会第三十一次会议通过了。这个预算的收入来源和支出分配，充分反映了过渡时期总任务的要求和全国人民和平建设的愿望。国家预算资金的主要来源，就是取之于国营经济方面的收入，这方面的收入占全年国家预算收入总额的百分之六三点五八。农民缴纳的比重则相对下降，仅占百分之十三点四三；私营工商业缴纳的比重占百分之十五点四○。国家预算资金的分配：包括经济建设、社会文教、巩固国防及必要的行政支出。用于经济建设和社会文教支出方面的支出，占全年预算支出总额的百分之六十以上。特别是用于发展重工业方面的投资，约占全部工业投资的百分之七八点三。这说明国家预算的安排上，是首先集中财力于发展重工业，同时还相应地照顾到其他经济建设及人民的物质文化生活和社会福利事业方面的。毛主席说过：“国家的预算是一个重大的问题，里面反映着整个国家的政策，因为他规定政府活动的范围和方向。”〔注一〕国家的预算既然反映了全部国民经济的活动，这就和全国人民发生着密切的关系。一方面，实现这个预算，将进一步为我国人民带来巨大的利益，如：工农业生产总值将比一九五三年增长百分之十二点六，国营企业职工、文教部门和国家机关工作人员的平均工资将提高百分之五点二，社会购买力将提高百分之十三点八，工农联盟将进一步巩固，国防力量将继续加强等。另一方面，保证预算的实现，也给予所有国家机关、企业部门、文化教育单位的职工以及全体人民以光荣的义务和重大的责任，这就是：全面完成与超额完成一九五四年国民经济计划，增加生产、提高质量、降低成本；积极守法、踊跃纳税；厉行精简节约、反对铺张浪费；加强财政监督，遵守财政纪律等。
    但是并非所有的人对国家预算都是这样理解的。如有些人看到目前某些消费资料供应不足，感觉“消费资料缺少是因为轻工业投资太少”，或者
  “消费资料出口太多了”。因而怀疑国家预算的投资比重是否合理。
    这种想法显然是不正确的。首先，国家对轻工业、农业的生产投资是逐年增加的。在保证重工业投资的前提下，为了适当满足人民对于日用消费品日益增长的需要，今年国家对轻工业和纺织工业的投资，比上年增长百分之四七点八六和百分之一○○点一九；对农林水利投资比一九五○年增长五倍。从主要消费资料的生产来看，一九五四年预计比一九五○年比例将增长如下：棉布一倍多，油料百分之四十多，粮食百分之五十左右，毛猪将比战前增加百分之三十三左右，国营轻工业一九五三年主要产品产量如纸张、卷烟、食盐、糖、胶鞋、药品等也比一九五○年增长了一倍半，一九五四年轻工业主要产品的计划产量，糖将比上年增长百分之二三点二，卷烟增长百分之一六点六，纸张增加百分之一四。
    其次，消费资料出口的比重是很小的。如今年毛猪计划出口量只占总产量百分之三，食油（包括油料）计划出口比上年减少将近三分之一；而人民生活资料的消费却是逐年提高的。过去农民吃不饱、穿不暖，今天不但粗粮够吃，还能吃到细粮，不但能穿上粗布，还穿新的花布衣服。工人的生活也有进一步的改善。一九五三年国营工厂工人工资收入比一九四九年增加了百分之六五到百分之一百三十；居住条件也在逐步改善，一九五二年和一九五三年两年内建筑的工人宿舍就可供一百多万人居住。过去城市职工人员看戏看电影的是少数，今天排队买票正是因为看的人太多了。
    由上可以说明，生产是大大增加了，但需要的增加更快。某些消费资料供不应求的现象，主要是由于人民生活普遍得到改善，消费量大大增加的结果。这不是坏现象，而正是反映了人民购买力的提高和福利的增进。一九五三年是我国大规模经济建设第一个五年计划的头一年，国家预算支出二一三万多亿元，今年国家预算支出又增为二四九万多亿元。因为我们预算是取之于民用之于民、所以这些钱无论用于基本建设、流动资金、文教事业、行政经费、国防建设、甚至国外订货等支出，归根到底，都增加了人民的购买力。一九五三年社会购买力比一九五二年提高了百分之二十左右，一九五四年又将比一九五三年提高百分之十三点八。这是引起消费品供不应求的根本原因。所以问题就在于随着国家预算支出的扩大，生产的发展，劳动人民收入的增加，而使购买力和对消费资料的需要都提高了。这种消费增长的速度，总是跑在生产增长速度前面的现象，正是表现了社会主义经济制度的根本优越性，是革命胜利的结果。斯大林同志曾说过：
  “我们苏联群众消费（购买力）的增加，总是赶过生产的扩张，推动生产前进；在资本家那里，情形恰恰相反，群众消费（购买力）的增加，总是赶不上生产的扩张，总是落在后面，这样就使生产转入恐慌。原因就在这里。”〔注二〕
    再次，若不首先发展重工业，要充分发展农业、轻工业也是不可能的。目前我国的农业生产，分散落后，增产速度缓慢，而且商品率（作为商品在市场出卖部分占该种农产品生产总数的比例）很低，不首先发展重工业，供应农业以机器装备和大量化学肥料，农业生产的提高是有限的。同时轻工业的原料如纺织用的棉花、制糖用的甘蔗、榨油用的油料，卷烟用的烟叶等，也都是靠农村供应，目前最大的问题是原料供应不足，机器吃不饱，愈多投资于轻工业则愈感原料不足；况且即使原料充足，若不加速发展重工业以机器装备轻工业，要充分发展轻工业也是办不到的。
    反过来说，自己既然生产不来，可不可以多进口些轻工业品和农产品呢？这也是不行的。这样做就会使我们像斯大林同志所形容的那个农民一样：
  “他积累了一点钱，但是他不用这些钱去修理犁头，革新自己的经济，却买了一个大留声机，……结果破产了。”〔注三〕这样的作法人民当然是不会同意的。
    那么出路何在呢？就是坚持首先集中财力发展重工业，同时相应地照顾到其他经济建设及人民的物质文化和福利事业的方针。一九五四年国家预算正是充分反映了这个要求。所以，保证完成国家预算是全体人民的最大利益。保证完成国家预算，就应该遵照毛主席指示的：“增产、节约、多留后备力量”去努力。大家知道，我国增加产量的潜力是很大的。国营企业如果提高劳动生产率，降低成本，就能为国家增加大量的产品，积累很多的资金。私营企业，如果充分利用现有设备，也能为国家增加很多产品，农业和手工业只要组织起来就能增产很多。中国人多、物博，只要大家动手，就能增加很多社会财富。就拿农民来说，每户多养一只鸡，每年就可多产一百亿个鸡蛋。所谓“兄弟齐了心，黄土变成金”，就是这个道理。同时，必须厉行节约。目前人民政府采取的食油、粮食的计划收购、计划供应的办法，从国民经济的观点来看，就是重要的节约方法之一，就是要把生产出来的东西，由国家集中起来加以有计划的分配和供应，使需要的人都能得到适当的满足。节约的方法是很多的。例如在企业方面，要节约原料，减少杂费，降低成本；在行政经费方面，要精简机构，节约经费。此外，还必须开展群众性的节约。由于我国人口众多，开展群众性的节约，具有特殊意义，例如全国每人每天节约一两米，每年可节约一百多亿斤；每人每年节约一尺布，就可以节约六百万匹布，可供三千万人穿一年；如果全国九十九个大中城市的人口，每人每月少吃一两猪肉，一年就可节约猪肉一万五千余吨，这些猪肉如果出口，即可换进钢材七万五千余吨或拖拉机一千五百部；如果全国每人一年少吃十个鸡蛋，就可节约六十多亿个鸡蛋，可以出口换回肥田粉二九○多万吨。因此，节约消费是对加速我国工业建设有极大利益的。苏联人民在为国家社会主义工业化而斗争的时期，就是“甘愿担受牺牲，在各方面实行极端节省，节省饮食，节省教育经费，节省布匹，以求积累创立工业所必要的资金。”〔注四〕我们必须学习苏联人民的这种艰苦奋斗的精神。
    目前，也还有用片面的观点来理解国家预算的事例：有些工商业者，在国家正确的经济政策之下获得了不少利益，他们表示拥护；但另一方面，偷税漏税的现象仍然相当严重。少数农民，他们对农田水利的建设，互助合作的发展，农业贷款的增加，十分满意；但对缴纳公粮，特别是把余粮卖给国家，产生了某些顾虑。也还有某些国营企业的干部甚至负责人，他们向国家提出的要求很多，当拨给他们所管的企业技术设备和流动资金的时候，他们的热情是很高的；但当这些东西拿到手里以后，他们却对国家资财表现了不负责任的玩忽态度，盲目施工，质量低劣，或使国家资金投入闲置和积压的材料中，不能及时发生效用；甚至有的铺张浪费，不讲求经济核算，不按时解缴利润和折旧基金，长期占用应缴到国家预算上的大宗款项。以上这些现象都必须加以反对。
    全体人民都应当认识到，保证国家预算的实施，力求国家财政计划达到收多于支和保持更多的后备力量，乃是我们共同的光荣而艰苦的斗争任务。因此，就要把增产节约的精神，贯彻到每一个人的工作和生活中去；应当把社会主义建设的利益，放在我们活动的顶点；小利益服从大利益；目前利益服从长远利益；发扬艰苦奋斗的精神，在生产和消费上，树立服从国家计划的整体思想。只有全体人民对国家预算的执行都抱有高度责任感时，国家预算的胜利实现，才有了最可靠的保证。
