Great Victory of the Forces of Peace over the Forces of War
By our correspondents Jiang Yuanchun and Li Zhuang

    July 21, 1954, is a day of world historical significance. At 3:30 in the morning, the ceasefire agreements for Vietnam and Laos were signed in the conference hall of the old League of Nations building. At 12:30 in the afternoon, the ceasefire agreement for Cambodia was signed at the same location. At 3:00 p.m., the final plenary session on the Indochina issue was held, passing a series of declarations, statements, and other documents. The Indochina Conference thus completed its mission, and the eight-year-long bloody war was brought to an end.

    Geneva was particularly busy on the morning of the 20th. The foreign ministers of the Soviet Union, China, Britain, and France were engaged in final consultations in twos and threes. Experts carefully corrected the final versions of various documents. The staff of the old League of Nations building were notified to fully complete all technical preparations so that a plenary session could be held at any time. Reporters from all over the world gathered in the hall of the "Press House" and the corridors of the old League of Nations building, looking at their watches from time to time, whispering to each other: "When exactly will the signing take place?" It is said that Smith stayed in his house all day on this day...

    As expected, a problem arose at the last minute before the agreement was to be reached. The plenary session originally scheduled for the afternoon of the 20th was postponed to the evening, and then further postponed to the morning of the 21st, and only the ceasefire agreements for Vietnam and Laos were signed. The signing ceremony for the Cambodian ceasefire agreement, originally scheduled for 11:30 a.m. on the 21st, was again postponed to 12:30 p.m. The reason was that the Cambodian representatives were again creating obstacles on issues that had already been agreed upon, attempting to refuse to sign. Naturally, people unanimously associated this behavior with the American representatives.

    After the signing matters were all settled on the afternoon of the 21st, news and an atmosphere of universal jubilation spread from Paris and all over the world. Although there is still a period of time between the achievement of the ceasefire agreement and the realization of the ceasefire, and although people must remain vigilant against continued sabotage by the United States, no matter what, the forces demanding peace have once again won a great victory. The American conspiracy to continue and expand the war in this region of Asia has suffered another serious defeat.

    For several days, people have been worried about the American conspiracy to undermine the agreement reached at the conference. Dulles ran to Paris in mid-July to exert pressure on Britain and France once again, attempting to replace the Indochina ceasefire agreement with the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc, but this American conspiracy failed due to the insistence of the Chinese, Soviet, and Vietnamese delegations and the strong pressure of world public opinion.

    In fact, Dulles had played the same trick in Paris before the Geneva Conference even began, and during the more than seventy days of the Indochina Conference, the United States never put forward a single constructive suggestion. It has played the role of a saboteur from beginning to end. However, the era of the United States imposing its own opinions on others is long gone. This is reflected in the fact that although it was able to force its followers to break off negotiations on the Korean issue, it failed to prevent the realization of a ceasefire in Indochina. History is developing in the opposite direction to the American "policy of strength."

    The Geneva Conference opened on April 26 and began to discuss the Korean issue. On April 27, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov discussed the issue of the members of the Indochina Conference with Bidault; Bidault, following Dulles' instructions, attempted to prevent representatives of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam from attending the conference. This unreasonable demand by Bidault delayed the start of discussions on the Indochina issue until May 3, on the eve of the French National Assembly's debate on the Indochina issue, when Bidault abandoned this unreasonable demand, and an agreement was reached on the issue of members. However, after the Laniel government obtained a vote of confidence from the French National Assembly, Bidault postponed the Indochina Conference, originally scheduled to begin on May 7, by one day.

    On May 3, Dulles, unable to manipulate the progress of the conference on either the Korean or Indochina issues, left Geneva in shame, but he left instructions for Bidault, demanding that Bidault continue to support the American policy of sabotage. Subsequent events showed that Bidault faithfully carried out this instruction from Dulles.

    On May 8, the Geneva Conference began to discuss the Indochina issue. The Acting Foreign Minister of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Pham Van Dong, made a statement at the meeting, demanding that representatives of the Laotian and Cambodian Resistance Governments attend the conference and participate in the discussions. However, this reasonable proposal was rejected by the American and French delegations. On the same day, Bidault put forward a plan to resolve the Indochina issue. This plan only addressed military issues, neglecting political issues, and completely ignored the legitimate demands of the Indochinese people for national independence and democratic freedom. Moreover, in this military ceasefire plan, Bidault, disregarding the military reality in Indochina, acted as if he were a victor, putting forward conditions that amounted to demanding the surrender of the Indochinese people. This attitude of Bidault aroused public outrage. The British "Observer" believed that Bidault's speech that day took a "provocative attitude" and pointed out that Bidault "expects the Geneva Conference to prove that negotiations are useless—and therefore joint intervention, which was rejected two weeks ago, is still necessary."

    In contrast to the French attitude, Pham Van Dong put forward a comprehensive, fair, and reasonable proposal on May 10. This proposal included both a political and military solution to the Indochina issue. It not only conformed to the wishes of the Indochinese people for national independence and democratic freedom, but also took into account French cultural and economic interests in Indochina. Pham Van Dong's proposal was supported by the Chinese and Soviet delegations. Public opinion in various countries generally believed that Pham Van Dong's proposal could serve as the basis for negotiations. This proposal was particularly well-received in France.

    However, the French delegation, which followed the United States, immediately announced its rejection of Pham Van Dong's proposal after it was put forward. Dulles also declared in Washington on May 11 that Pham Van Dong's proposal was completely unacceptable. Dulles also put pressure on Bidault, forcing him to violate the demands of French public opinion and continue to follow the United States.

    Bidault's attitude aroused great anger among the French people. The French National Assembly once again launched a debate on the Indochina issue; the Laniel government encountered another crisis. Only then did the French delegation have to change its tune, saying that it "did not reject the Viet Minh's proposal." However, when the Laniel government barely obtained a vote of confidence on the evening of May 13 by a mere two votes, the French delegation reverted to its old ways and still did not show the due sincerity in the progress of the conference.

    On May 14, in order to promote the progress of the conference, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov put forward two supplementary proposals to Pham Van Dong's proposal:

  (1) Organize a neutral nation commission to assist and supervise the implementation of the ceasefire agreement; (2) The participating countries jointly guarantee the implementation of the ceasefire agreement. Molotov's proposal was generally recognized as an important development of the conference and was therefore widely welcomed.

    Due to the active efforts of Vietnam, the Soviet Union, and China to create conditions for the conference to enter into concrete negotiations, the conference adopted a restricted meeting format from May 17.

    However, what the United States and the French war faction were actively engaged in at this time was not seeking an agreement, but preparing conditions for continuing and expanding the Indochina War. After surviving the crisis of being overthrown, the Laniel government immediately requested large-scale reinforcements to Indochina, conscripted new recruits, and expanded the army. At the same time, negotiations on the conditions for direct American intervention in the Indochina War were conducted between the United States and France. Under the auspices of the United States, negotiations on the organization of the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc were also intensified in Washington. The United States also instructed Thailand to submit a request to the United Nations Security Council to investigate the Indochina issue, preparing to once again use the name of the United Nations to intervene in the Indochina War.

    This series of conspiracies was reflected in the Geneva Conference as the United States and the French war faction stubbornly adopted an attitude of refusing to negotiate with the efforts of Vietnam, the Soviet Union, and China to seek an agreement at the restricted meetings.

    At the first restricted meeting on May 17, the American and French delegations stubbornly demanded that Bidault's plan be the basis for discussion, refusing to discuss political issues. Only in the end did they agree to Molotov's suggestion to combine Pham Van Dong's plan with Bidault's plan for discussion; not only to discuss the military ceasefire, but also to discuss a political solution, and to first discuss the military ceasefire. However, at the second and third restricted meetings, the American and French delegations again created obstacles, demanding that the Laotian and Cambodian issues be handled separately first according to Bidault's plan, thus limiting the meeting to wasteful and unproductive debates. Only after these unreasonable demands were severely refuted by the representatives of Vietnam, the Soviet Union, and China did the representatives of the United States, France, Britain, and other countries accept the discussion procedure and the five suggestions related to the military ceasefire put forward by Molotov at the fourth restricted meeting on May 21.

    In order to promote the progress of the negotiations, the Soviet delegation suggested at the fifth restricted meeting on May 24 that the parties concerned in the Indochina ceasefire establish direct contact. However, the French delegation did not accept it. On the same day, Pham Van Dong also made a specific suggestion on the early simultaneous cessation of hostilities throughout Indochina. The next day, the Soviet delegation supplemented the British delegation's proposal, suggesting that in order to quickly and simultaneously cease hostilities in Indochina, representatives of the two sides' command headquarters should not only meet immediately in Geneva, but also establish direct contact locally. However, the American and French delegations repeated the old tune of first ceasing hostilities in Laos and Cambodia, opposing the principle of simultaneous ceasefire throughout Indochina, thus preventing an agreement from being reached.

    On May 27, Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai put forward six suggestions on the basic principles for ceasing hostilities in Indochina. These six suggestions later became the basis for the conference's discussions, thus promoting the progress of the conference.

    Due to the efforts of Vietnam, the Soviet Union, and China, and also because the French National Assembly was about to hold a debate on the Indochina issue, the French delegation was forced by public opinion to show some willingness to negotiate. Therefore, at the eighth restricted meeting on May 29, it finally obtained the first agreement since the beginning of the conference. This agreement stipulated that the command headquarters of both sides should immediately contact each other in Geneva and locally to study the deployment of the two sides' troops after the cessation of hostilities; this study should begin with the issue of regrouping areas in Vietnam. When this agreement was passed, the American delegation thoroughly exposed its ugly intention to obstruct the achievement of any agreement. The American representative Smith openly declared that the United States "neither accepts nor opposes" the principles stipulated in this agreement. This attitude of the United States even aroused dissatisfaction among the delegations of Western countries.

    According to this agreement, representatives of the Vietnamese and French command headquarters began talks in Geneva from June 2. However, due to delays on the French side, the contact between the two sides' command headquarters in Indochina did not begin until July 4.

    From May 31, the conference began to discuss the issue of ceasefire supervision. The delegations of Vietnam, the Soviet Union, and China put forward specific and reasonable opinions on the organization, members, and interrelationships of the two ceasefire supervision mechanisms—the joint commission composed of the belligerent parties and the neutral nation supervisory commission. However, the American and French delegations tried their best to obstruct it. Like on the issue of international supervision of free elections in Korea, the United States opposed the participation of Poland and Czechoslovakia in the neutral nation supervisory commission on the absurd grounds that so-called communist countries are not neutral. The delegations of the United States, France, Britain, and other countries also demanded that the joint commission be subordinate to the neutral nation supervisory commission. Due to the insistence of the American and French delegations on this unreasonable proposition, the restricted meeting made little progress until June 4. Therefore, according to Molotov's suggestion, the conference decided to hold a plenary session from June 8.

    While the American and French delegations were obstructing the progress of the conference, the French people were becoming increasingly angry at the French delegation led by Bidault for pursuing American policy. In the French National Assembly's debate on the Indochina issue on June 1 and 2, the Laniel government was sharply criticized. Members of various parties demanded that the Laniel government step down, change the French delegation's policy at the Geneva Conference, and achieve a glorious peaceful settlement of the Indochina issue. Hundreds and thousands of French people's delegations flocked to Geneva to express their will.

    In order to conceal from French public opinion the truth that the French delegation was following the United States in obstructing the negotiations, Bidault attempted to attribute all the achievements made by the conference up to that time to himself at the plenary session on June 8. However, he did not put forward anything new to promote the progress of the conference, while avoiding discussing a political solution. At the three-day plenary session from June 8 to 10, the delegations of Vietnam, the Soviet Union, and China pointed out the achievements that the conference had already made and the differences that still existed, and put forward specific and constructive opinions on ways to resolve these differences. In their speeches, the foreign ministers of the three countries strongly condemned the American conspiracy to expand the Indochina War and obstruct the progress of the conference, and pointed out that the French war faction's policy of following the United States' war policy was not in the interests of the French people.

    Bidault's disguise was exposed, and the French people's dissatisfaction with the Laniel government, which betrayed their interests, reached its peak. On June 12, the Laniel government faced the third vote of confidence in the National Assembly since the beginning of the Geneva Conference. This time, the Laniel government was unable to escape the punishment of the French people, failed in the vote of confidence, and was finally forced to resign. Mendes France expressed his willingness to work towards peace in Indochina, and was able to quickly form a new cabinet.

    In the first few days of mid-June, the Geneva Conference reached a critical juncture. The United States originally intended to completely break off negotiations on the Korean issue at this time, and to take advantage of the fall of the Laniel cabinet to disrupt negotiations on the Indochina issue as much as possible, or at least create "an indefinite adjournment."

    In the few days before and after the United States broke off negotiations on the Korean issue on June 15, pessimistic remarks appeared in Western newspapers, attempting to convince people that "it is impossible to reach any agreement with the communists."

    As everyone knows, in the two weeks before this, in the conference's discussion on the issue of supervision, the participating countries all acknowledged that in order to stabilize the ceasefire in Indochina, it was necessary to establish a joint commission composed of representatives of the belligerent parties and a supervisory commission composed of neutral nations. However, necessary agreements could not be reached on the powers of the above-mentioned commissions, the members of the neutral nation supervisory commission, and the voting procedures. The clear and reasonable opinions put forward by the Soviet delegation on June 14 on the composition, scope of authority, general rules, and international guarantees of the above-mentioned commissions provided a good basis for resolving the issue of supervision. If one examines the records of the conference, one will find that the nine-nation conference's agreement on the issue of ceasefire supervision was based on the Soviet delegation's proposal of June 14.

    The Soviet delegation's proposal received the full support of the Chinese delegation and the Vietnamese delegation. The Chinese delegation also pointed out at the meeting that some delegations were not interested in the similarities in the opinions of all parties, but tried to expand many differences, and even deliberately created an artificial deadlock, in order to create an excuse for some kind of attempt. The Chinese delegation stated that it was still willing to continue to work hard to find ways to overcome difficulties in order to reach an agreement as soon as possible.

    At the restricted meeting on the 16th, three suggestions put forward by the delegations of the Soviet Union, China, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam further frustrated the conspiracy of those who wanted to adjourn the conference in a hurry.

    In order to break the opponent's conspiracy to obstruct the resolution of the entire Indochina issue by using the "special" nature of the Laos and Cambodia issues as an excuse, the Chinese delegation proposed a suggestion for resolving the Laos and Cambodia issues at the meeting on the 16th, hoping that representatives of the command headquarters of the belligerent parties would quickly begin direct negotiations in Geneva and locally on issues related to the cessation of hostilities in Laos and Cambodia.

    At the meeting on the 16th, the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam put forward a suggestion for resolving the political issues of Indochina. This suggestion expressed the principles of establishing lasting peace in Indochina, safeguarding the national rights of the Indochinese people, restoring the unity of Vietnam, and taking care of France's economic and cultural interests in Indochina. It was reasonable, legitimate, and realistic.

    In order to quickly resolve the issue of ceasefire supervision, the Soviet delegation again put forward a new suggestion on the issue of the members of the neutral nation supervisory commission at the same meeting. The Soviet delegation put forward two plans, one including five member countries and one including three member countries, hoping that the conference would reach an agreement on one of the two plans.

    Worldwide public opinion (including some right-wing newspapers) unanimously praised the major efforts made by the Soviet, Chinese, and Vietnamese delegations at the meeting on the 16th. The Chinese delegation's suggestion on the Laos and Cambodia issues attracted even more attention from the people of the world. The French "Humanité" said that these suggestions "gave a resounding denial to those who used the breakdown of the debate on the Korean issue as an excuse to declare that discussions on the Indochina issue would enter a dead end." "Le Monde" said that these suggestions made the conference "satisfactorily recover... repelling any tendency towards adjournment." "France-Soir" said that these suggestions made "the conference have a new starting point." "Libération" said, "It is hoped that the difficulties caused by Bidault on the Laos and Cambodia issues will be resolved." Newspapers in Britain, Switzerland, and many Asian countries all regarded these suggestions as "the hope for the success of the conference."

    However, although these suggestions were called "constructive and consultative" by most delegations, although the main parties involved, France, Laos, and Cambodia, all believed that "there was nothing to oppose," and although Smith had also stated at the meeting on the 16th that "many places were agreeable," at the meeting on the 18th, American representative Robertson went back on his word and openly stated that this suggestion was "unacceptable." On the 18th, Smith ran from Geneva to Bern for a reason, and Robertson led the American delegation. It was very obvious that this act of "eating one's own words" was a pre-arranged step, a criminal "strategy" of the United States to undermine the agreement reached at the conference. The "New York Herald Tribune" confessed: "American officials are considering how to interrupt this conference discussing Far Eastern issues, while pushing the responsibility on the Russians as much as possible."

    The American sabotage activities did not achieve their intended purpose. At the meeting on the 18th, the Chinese delegation pointed out that Robertson's going back on his word was intended to provoke disputes so that an agreement could not be reached. The Chinese delegation stated that it was not difficult to deal with this kind of challenge, but China preferred to devote itself to seeking reconciliation in order to reach an agreement in principle. The Soviet delegation and the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam also made righteous condemnations of the American sabotage, while pointing out that the Chinese delegation's suggestion took into account the opinions of all parties, fully conformed to the actual situation in Laos and Cambodia, and should therefore be used as the basis for reaching an agreement.

    The efforts of the Chinese, Soviet, and Vietnamese delegations achieved preliminary results on the 19th. On this day, the participating countries reached an agreement on the issue of ceasing hostilities in Cambodia and Laos based on the Chinese delegation's suggestion. Of course, as when the agreement to cease hostilities in Vietnam was passed on May 29, the American representative again made a "reservation" on this agreement, and openly stated that it would reserve the "right" to accept or reject the suggestions of the two sides' command headquarters to be submitted to the conference in the future.

    From the end of June to the beginning of July, the foreign ministers of the five major powers temporarily left Geneva, and the assistant foreign ministers continued to hold restricted meetings to discuss issues such as ceasefire supervision. At the same time, military representatives from both sides intensified discussions in Geneva on the issue of ceasing hostilities, and direct negotiations began in the local area. People know that preventing the two sides from engaging in direct negotiations was one of the important means by which the United States sabotaged the conference. It attempted to permanently place the conference under its direct control so that the conference could not reach any agreement. However, due to the persistent efforts of the Chinese, Soviet, and Vietnamese delegations, and the British and French delegations gradually adopting a positive attitude, the conference was able to increasingly get rid of American influence. Facts have proved that the direct negotiations conducted by experts in Geneva and locally made an important contribution to the development of the entire issue.

    Around July 10, the foreign ministers of the Soviet Union, China, Britain, and France successively returned to Geneva and began the final stage of intense talks in the form of individual contacts, making more or less progress every day. Geneva was filled with a cautious atmosphere of optimism. People have already seen that if the conference continues to develop in this direction, it is possible to reach an agreement quickly. Of course, this situation immediately aroused the anxiety of the American warmongering group, because the prospect of reaching an agreement completely ran counter to their fundamental policies. On July 13, Dulles flew to Paris in a hurry and held one-sided talks with the British and French foreign ministers. According to Western newspapers, Dulles repeatedly exerted pressure on the British and French foreign ministers during the talks, forcing them to agree to organize the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc, and conspiring to include Bao Dai and Laos and Cambodia into it, as a base for the United States to further launch aggression in Southeast Asia. As a result, Geneva was cast under a gloomy atmosphere for several days.

    Now the conference has broken through American obstruction and sabotage at the last minute, and has finally reached a comprehensive agreement on the issue of restoring peace in Indochina. The eight-year war can be stopped, the period of peaceful life for the Indochinese people is about to begin, and French soldiers have the opportunity to reunite with their families. This is a victory for peace-loving people all over the world, a victory for the peaceful diplomacy of the Soviet Union, China, and Vietnam, and a victory for the spirit of consultation. This victory once again eloquently illustrates a truth: as long as the progressive forces of the world take on the cause of safeguarding peace, the conspiracies of the war provokers can be defeated, international tensions can be further eased, and the cause of world peace can be lasting and consolidated.

    和平力量对于战争力量的伟大胜利
    本报记者　蒋元椿　李庄
    一九五四年七月二十一日，是一个具有世界历史意义的日子。清晨三点半钟，越南和老挝停战协定在旧国联大厦会议厅签字。中午十二时半，柬埔寨停战协定在同一地点签字。下午三时举行印度支那问题最后一次全体大会，通过一系列宣言、声明和其他文件。印度支那问题会议至此完成了自己的任务，持续八年的流血战争得以停止了。
      日内瓦在二十日上午就格外忙碌起来，苏、中、英、法的外长们，三三两两地交叉着进行最后的商谈。专家们仔细校正各种文件的最后定本。旧国联大厦的办事人员接到通知，把一切技术准备完全办妥，以便随时能够举行全体大会。来自世界各地的记者们麇集在“记者之家”的大厅里和旧国联大厦的走廊上，不时看看手表，互相低声谈着：“到底在什么时候签字呢？”这天据说只有史密斯整天关在自己的房子里……。
      不出人们的预料，会议在将要达成协议的最后一分钟出了问题，原定在二十日下午举行的全体会议，推迟到晚间，以后又推迟到二十一日清晨，而且只就越南和老挝的停战协定签了字。原定在二十一日上午十一时半举行的柬埔寨停战协定签字仪式，又被推迟到中午十二时半。原因是柬埔寨的代表又在已经同意了的问题上节外生枝，企图拒绝签字。自然，人们不约而同地把这种行径和美国代表联系起来。
    二十一日下午签字事宜都已办理就绪以后，从巴黎以及全世界各地传来的消息和气氛是万众欢腾。尽管停战协定的达成和停战的实现之间还有一段时间，尽管人们还必须警惕美国的继续破坏，但不管如何，要求和平的力量又一次获得了伟大的胜利。美国在亚洲这一地区继续和扩大战争的阴谋又遭到一次严重的失败。
    几天以来，人们担心的就是美国破坏会议达成协议的阴谋。杜勒斯在七月中旬跑到巴黎对英法再一次施加压力，企图以东南亚侵略集团代替印度支那停战协定，只是由于中、苏、越代表团的坚持反对，和世界舆论的强大压力，美国这个阴谋才未能实现。
    其实，早在日内瓦会议开始之前，杜勒斯就曾经到巴黎玩弄同样的阴谋，而在印度支那会议七十多天的长时间中，美国从未提出过一次建设性的意见。它自始至终扮演着一个破坏者的角色。但是，美国以一己意见强加于人的时代是早已过去了，这表现在它虽然能够迫使它的追随者破裂了朝鲜问题的商谈，但未能阻止印度支那停战的实现。历史是朝着美国“实力政策”相反的方向发展的。
    日内瓦会议在四月二十六日开幕，开始讨论朝鲜问题。四月二十七日，苏联外长莫洛托夫就和皮杜尔商谈印度支那问题会议的成员问题；皮杜尔按照杜勒斯的指示，企图不让越南民主共和国的代表出席会议。皮杜尔这个无理要求拖延了印度支那问题讨论的开始，一直到五月三日法国国民议会辩论印度支那问题的前夕，皮杜尔才放弃了这个无理主张，会议从而在成员问题上达成了协议。但是在拉尼埃政府取得法国国民议会的信任票以后，皮杜尔又将原定在五月七日开始举行的印度支那问题会议推迟了一天。
    五月三日，杜勒斯由于无论在朝鲜问题或是印度支那问题上都无法操纵会议的进展，羞惭地离开了日内瓦，但是他给皮杜尔留下了指示，要求皮杜尔继续支持美国的破坏政策。以后的事实表明，皮杜尔忠实地执行了杜勒斯的这一指示。
      五月八日日内瓦会议开始讨论印度支那问题，越南民主共和国代理外长范文同在会上发表声明，要求寮国和高棉抗战政府的代表出席会议，参加讨论。但是这个合理的主张遭到了美国和法国代表团的拒绝。同一天，皮杜尔提出了一个解决印度支那问题的方案，这个方案只谈到军事问题，撇开政治问题不谈，完全忽视了印度支那人民对于民族独立和民主自由的正当要求。而且在这个军事停战方案中，皮杜尔不顾印度支那的军事现实，俨然以胜利者自居，提出了等于要印度支那人民投降的条件。皮杜尔这种态度激起了舆论的愤慨。英国的“观察家报”认为，皮杜尔在这一天的发言中所采取的是“挑衅的态度”，并且指出皮杜尔“期望日内瓦会议将证明谈判是无用的——因而两星期前被拒绝的联合干涉还是必要的”。
    和法国的态度相反，范文同在五月十日提出了一个全面的公平合理的建议，这个建议包含了印度支那问题的政治解决和军事解决，它不仅符合印度支那人民要求民族独立、民主自由的愿望，而且照顾到了法国在印度支那的文化上和经济上的利益。范文同的建议得到了中、苏两国代表团的支持。各国舆论也普遍认为范文同的建议可以作为谈判的基础。这个建议特别在法国获得了良好的印象。
    但是追随美国的法国代表团在范文同提出建议以后，立即宣布加以拒绝。杜勒斯也在五月十一日在华盛顿宣称，范文同的建议是完全不能接受的。杜勒斯并且对皮杜尔施加压力，强迫他违反法国舆论的要求，继续跟着美国走。
    皮杜尔的态度在法国人民中间引起了极大的愤怒。法国国民议会再次展开对印度支那问题的辩论；拉尼埃政府又遇到了危机。法国代表团这才不得不改口说，它“并未拒绝越盟的建议”。但是当拉尼埃政府在五月十三日晚以仅仅两票多数勉强获得信任以后，法国代表团就故态复萌，仍然没有对会议进展表示应有的诚意。
    五月十四日，苏联外长莫洛托夫为了推动会议的进展，对范文同的建议提出了两点补充建议：
  （一）组织中立国委员会协助和监督停战协议的实施；（二）与会各国共同保证停战协议的实施。莫洛托夫的建议被公认为是会议的重要发展，因而得到了普遍的欢迎。
    由于越、苏、中三国的主动的努力创造了会议进入具体协商的条件，因而从五月十七日起会议采取了限制性会议的形式。
    但是美国和法国主战派这时所积极进行的却不是谋求协议，而是为继续和扩大印度支那战争准备条件。拉尼埃政府在度过倒阁危机之后，立即要求大规模增援印度支那，征召新兵，扩充兵员，同时在美国和法国之间进行了关于美国直接干涉印度支那战争的条件的谈判。在美国主持之下，关于组织东南亚侵略集团的谈判也在华盛顿加紧进行。美国还指使泰国向联合国安全理事会提出调查印度支那问题的要求，为再次利用联合国名义干涉印度支那战争进行准备。
    这一连串阴谋活动反映在日内瓦会议上，就是美国和法国主战派在限制性会议上对于越、苏、中三国谋求协议的努力顽固地采取拒绝协商的态度。
    在五月十七日的第一次限制性会议上，美、法代表团固执地要求以皮杜尔的方案为讨论基础，拒绝讨论政治问题。直到最后，它们才同意了莫洛托夫的建议，即将范文同的方案与皮杜尔的方案合并讨论；不仅讨论军事停战，而且讨论政治解决，首先讨论军事停战。但是在第二次和第三次限制性会议上，美、法代表团却又节外生枝，要求首先按照皮杜尔的方案单独处理寮国和高棉的问题，因而使会议限于废时无益的争论之中。只是在这种无理要求遭到越、苏、中三国代表的严正驳斥之后，美、法、英等国代表团才在五月二十一日第四次限制性会议上接受了莫洛托夫所提出的讨论程序和有关军事停战的五点建议。
    苏联代表团为了推动谈判的进展，在五月二十四日第五次限制性会议上建议印度支那停战有关各方建立直接接触。但是法国代表团未予接受。在同一天，范文同又就在印度支那全境早日同时停止敌对行动提出了具体建议。第二天，苏联代表团又补充英国代表团的建议，建议为迅速并同时在印度支那停止敌对行动，双方司令部代表除应立即在日内瓦会晤外，并应在当地建立直接接触。但是美国和法国代表团却重弹首先在寮国和高棉停止敌对行动的老调，反对在印度支那全境同时停火的原则，因而使协议未能达成。
    五月二十七日，周恩来外长提出了关于在印度支那停止敌对行动的基本原则的六点建议，这六点建议以后成为会议讨论的基础，因而推动了会议的进展。
    由于越、苏、中三国的努力，同时由于法国国民议会又将举行关于印度支那问题的辩论，法国代表团迫于舆论的压力，不能不表示某些愿意谈判的姿态，因此在五月二十九日第八次限制性会议上终于获得了自会议开始以来的第一个协议。这个协议规定：双方司令部应立即在日内瓦和当地接触，研究停止敌对行动以后双方军队的部署问题；此项研究应从在越南的重新集结地区问题开始。在通过这项协议时，美国代表团彻底暴露了它阻挠达成任何协议的丑恶意图。美国代表史密斯公然宣称：美国对这一协议中所规定的原则“既不接受也不反对”。美国的这种态度甚至在西方国家的代表团中间也引起了不满。
    根据这一项协议，越、法双方司令部的代表从六月二日起在日内瓦开始会谈。但是由于法国方面的拖延，双方司令部在印度支那当地的接触直到七月四日方才开始。
    从五月三十一日起，会议开始讨论停战监察问题。越、苏、中三国代表团就停战监察的两种机构——由交战双方组成的联合委员会和中立国监察委员会——的组织成员、相互关系等问题提出了具体的、合理的意见。但是美法代表团却竭力进行阻挠。美国像在朝鲜的自由选举的国际监察问题上一样，以所谓共产主义国家不是中立国这种荒唐的理由，反对波兰和捷克斯洛伐克参加中立国监察委员会。美、法、英等代表团并且要求将联合委员会隶属于中立国监察委员会。由于美、法等代表团坚持这种无理主张，以致限制性会议一直到六月四日仍然进展很少。因此，根据莫洛托夫的建议，会议决定自六月八日起举行全体会议。
    与美法代表团阻挠会议进展同时，法国人民对于以皮杜尔为首的法国代表团奉行美国的政策越来越感到愤怒。在六月一日和二日，法国国民议会关于印度支那问题的辩论中，拉尼埃政府遭到了尖锐的抨击。各党派的议员纷纷要求拉尼埃政府下台，改变法国代表团在日内瓦会议上的政策，使印度支那问题得到光荣的和平解决。成百成千的法国人民代表团涌到日内瓦来，表示他们的意志。
    为了向法国舆论遮掩法国代表团追随美国阻挠谈判的真相，皮杜尔在六月八日的全体会议上企图把到当时为止会议所取得的某些成就全都归功于自己，可是他并没有提出任何新的东西来推动会议的进展，同时避而不谈政治解决。在六月八日到十日的三天全体会议上，越、苏、中三国代表团指出了会议已经取得的成就和仍然存在的分歧，并就解决这些分歧的办法提出了具体的建设性的意见。三国外长在发言中强烈谴责了美国所进行的扩大印度支那战争、阻挠会议进展的阴谋，并且指出了法国主战派追随美国的战争政策，是不符合于法国人民的利益的。
    皮杜尔的伪装被揭穿了，法国人民对叛卖他们的利益的拉尼埃政府的不满达到了顶点。六月十二日，拉尼埃政府在国民议会中面临了自日内瓦会议开始以来的第三次信任投票。这一次拉尼埃政府没有能够逃过法国人民的惩罚，在信任投票中遭到失败，终于被迫辞职。孟戴斯—弗朗斯表示了努力实现印度支那和平的意愿，得以迅速组成新的内阁。
    六月中旬的最初几天，日内瓦会议临到紧要关头。美国原拟在这个时候彻底破裂关于朝鲜问题的谈判，并利用拉尼埃内阁倒台的机会，尽可能把印度支那问题的谈判搞垮，至少也要造成“一个无限期的休会”。
    在美国和它的追随者在六月十五日破裂朝鲜问题谈判的前后几天，西方报纸上出现了连篇累牍的悲观论调，它们企图使人们相信“和共产党达成任何协议是不可能的”。
    大家知道，在这以前的两周，会议关于监察问题的讨论中，与会各国都承认为了稳定印度支那的停战，必须成立由交战双方代表组成的联合委员会和由中立国组成的监察委员会。但关于上述委员会的职权，中立国监察委员会的成员，和表决程序，始终未能达成必要的协议。苏联代表团在六月十四日就上述委员会的组成、职权范围、一般规则和国际保证等问题提出的明确合理的意见，给监察问题的解决提供了良好的基础。如果查对一下会议的记录，人们就会发现九国会议关于停战监察问题的协议，是以苏联代表团六月十四日的建议为基础达成的。
    苏联代表团的建议获得中国代表团和越南代表团的全力支持。中国代表团并在会议上指出，某些代表团对于各方意见中的相同点不感兴趣，对于许多差异点却尽量扩大，甚至有意造成一种人为的僵局，为某种企图制造借口。中国代表团表示仍愿继续努力寻求方法克服困难，以便尽快达成协议。
    在十六日的限制性会议上，苏联、中国、越南民主共和国代表团提出的三个建议，进一步挫折了那些想使会议草草休会的人们的阴谋。
    为了打破对方借口老挝、柬埔寨问题“特殊”，而阻挠解决整个印度支那问题的阴谋，中国代表团在十六日会议上提出了解决老挝和柬埔寨问题的建议，希望交战双方司令部代表迅速就有关在老挝和柬埔寨境内停止敌对行动问题在日内瓦并在当地开始进行直接谈判。
    在十六日会议上，越南民主共和国代表团提出了解决印度支那政治问题的建议，这个建议表达了建立印度支那持久和平、维护印度支那人民的民族权利、恢复越南的统一和照顾法国在印度支那的经济与文化利益的原则，它是合情合理与实事求是的。
    为了迅速解决关于停战监察问题，苏联代表团又在同一次会议上就中立国监察委员会的成员问题提出新的建议。苏联代表团提出了包括五个成员国和包括三个成员国的两个方案，希望会议就两个方案之一达成协议。
    全世界的舆论（包括某些右派报纸）一致称赞苏、中、越代表团在十六日会议上所作的重大努力。中国代表团关于老挝、柬埔寨问题的建议，更引起全世界人民的重视。法国“人道报”说，这些建议“给那些借口朝鲜问题辩论破裂从而宣布印度支那问题讨论将进入死胡同的人们一个响亮的否定”。“世界报”说，这些建议使会议“令人满意的复苏……排斥了任何休会的倾向”。“法兰西晚报”说，这些建议使“会议有了新的起点”。“解放报”说，“可望看到皮杜尔就老挝和柬埔寨问题所引起的困难将得到解决”。英国、瑞士等国的报纸和许多亚洲国家的报纸，都把这些建议看成是“会议成功的希望”。
    但是尽管这些建议被多数代表团称为“富有建设性和协商精神”，尽管主要当事者的法国、老挝、柬埔寨代表都认为“没有可以反对之点”，尽管史密斯也曾在十六日会议上表示“许多地方是可以同意的”，但在十八日会议上美国代表罗伯逊却出尔反尔，公开表示这个建议是“不能接受的”。十八日，史密斯借故从日内瓦跑到伯尔尼，而由罗伯逊领导美国代表团，十分明显，这种“自食前言”的作法，是一种预先安排的步骤，是美国破坏会议达成协议的罪恶的“策略”。“纽约先驱论坛报”供认：“美国官员正在考虑，如何能使这个讨论远东问题的会议中断，而尽可能把责任推在俄国人身上”。
    美国的破坏活动并未能达到预期的目的。在十八日会议上，中国代表团指出，罗伯逊这样出尔反尔是想挑起争论，使协议不能达成。中国代表团表示对付这种挑战并不困难，但中国宁愿致力于求得和解，以期在原则上达成协议。苏联代表团和越南民主共和国代表团也对美国的破坏行为提出正义的谴责，同时指出中国代表团的建议考虑到了各方面的意见，完全符合老挝和柬埔寨的实际情况，因此应该以这个建议为基础达成协议。
    中、苏、越代表团的努力，在十九日得到初步的结果。在这一天，与会各国以中国代表团的建议为基础，达成了关于停止在柬埔寨和老挝的敌对行动问题的协议。当然和五月二十九日通过停止越南敌对行动协议的时候一样，美国代表又对这次协议提出“保留”，并公开表示要对将来提交会议的双方司令部的建议保留接受与否的“权利”。
    从六月下旬到七月上旬，五大国外长暂时离开日内瓦，而由外长助理继续举行限制性会议，讨论停战监察等问题。同时双方军事代表在日内瓦加紧进行关于停止敌对行动问题的讨论，并在当地陆续开始直接的谈判。人们知道，阻止双方进行直接谈判原是美国破坏会议的重要手段之一，它企图永远把会议置于它的直接控制之下，使会议不能达成任何协议。但是由于中、苏、越代表团的坚持努力，和英、法代表团逐渐采取了积极态度，会议得以日益摆脱美国的影响。事实证明，专家们在日内瓦和在当地进行的直接谈判对整个问题的发展作了重要的贡献。
    七月十日前后，苏、中、英、法的外长们先后回到日内瓦，采取个别接触的形式，开始了最后阶段的紧张的会谈，每日取得或多或少的进展。日内瓦充满审慎的乐观空气。人们都已看到，会议朝这种方向发展下去，迅速达成协议是可能的。当然，这种情况立即引起了美国好战集团的焦虑，因为达成协议的前景完全和它们的根本政策背道而驰。七月十三日，杜勒斯匆匆飞到巴黎和英法外长举行了片面会谈。据西方报纸透露，杜勒斯在会谈中一再对英法外长施加压力，迫使他们同意组织东南亚侵略集团，并阴谋将保大和老挝、柬埔寨两国包罗进去，作为美国进一步在东南亚发动侵略的基地。这样，日内瓦有好几天被投下一种阴沉的空气。
    现在会议击破美国在最后一分钟的阻挠和破坏，终于就恢复印度支那和平问题达成全面的协议。持续八年的战争可以停止了，印度支那人民的和平生活时期将要开始了，法国士兵有可能和他们的家人团聚了。这是全世界爱好和平人民的胜利，是苏、中、越和平外交政策的胜利，是协商精神的胜利。这次胜利再一次雄辩地说明了一个真理，只要全世界的进步力量把维护和平的事业担当起来，那么战争挑拨者的阴谋就能被击败，国际紧张局势就能进一步趋于缓和，世界的和平事业就能持久和巩固。
