Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, July 6th: N. Aggarwal, General Secretary of the All-India National Congress Committee, welcomed Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to India. Aggarwal said in Akola on the 4th that the joint statement of the Chinese and Indian Prime Ministers shows the world that Asian countries are capable of solving their own problems. Addressing a youth conference in Vidarbha, Aggarwal said that even though the basic political ideas of China and India are different, these differences should not be an obstacle to lasting friendship. China and India have maintained friendly neighborly relations for two thousand years and should continue to do so in the future, regardless of the power politics of Western countries.

    印度国大党总书记赞扬中印总理联合声明
   【新华社新德里六日电】印度国大党全国委员会总书记纳·阿葛尔瓦欢迎周恩来总理到印度的访问。阿葛尔瓦四日在阿科拉说：中印两国总理的联合声明向世界表明，亚洲各国能够解决它们自己的问题。阿葛尔瓦在维达巴的一个青年大会上致词说：即使中国和印度两国的基本政治思想是不同的，但是这些差异都不应成为持久友谊的障碍。印中两国已经维持了两千年的友好的邻邦关系，今后仍要不顾西方国家的强权政治而继续维持下去。
    印度国会议员纳·维·加德吉尔三日在萨塔拉的公众集会上说，印中两国总理最近的会谈是历史上为了建立世界和平而作的努力中头等重要的事件。加德吉尔在谈到五项原则时说，两位总理共同提出的原则将有助于创造有利于和平的气氛。加德吉尔最后说，在德里发生的事情具有世界意义，无论在最近和很远的将来，都会对国际事务发生影响。
