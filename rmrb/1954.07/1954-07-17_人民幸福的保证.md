Guarantee of People's Happiness
By our reporters Fu Dong and Bai Sheng

Early in the morning, a little after five o'clock, the convalescents at the Dalian-Lushun Workers' Sanatorium were already awake. Pushing open the large glass windows in front of their beds, they could hear the sound of the waves gently lapping against the shore. The vast, calm sea was stirred by the wind, creating fine ripples. Several sailboats floated on the distant sea. Looking at this beautiful scenery, people felt as if they were in a painting.

After breakfast, some convalescents sat on the benches in the small garden in front of the building, gazing at the beautiful sea view and the clouds in the sky; others sat in front of blooming roses, chatting; and those with high spirits went for a walk on the nearby hilltop.

As we were talking with several convalescents, someone suddenly noticed many red flags planted on a building by the beach. "What holiday is it today!" Upon inquiry, it turned out that the advanced workers of Dalian-Lushun's basic construction were coming here for a holiday.

Running down the hill, we saw that some advanced workers had already arrived. The venue was surrounded by pictures of safe production and photos of advanced Soviet basic construction experiences. Zhang Zhaogang, a 59-year-old convalescent, looked at the paintings and then took a stroll around the temporary library. There were so many books! There were comic books, pictorials... There were also many activities, including cross-talk performances and a choir... The entire beach was bustling.

Convalescent Dai Enjun sat on the shore, watching the rising tide and the white waves breaking on the shore. He said with emotion: "The hard work of the people brings so much joy and happiness to life!" He then said: "But these things only happen in the new society, only explicitly stipulated in the constitution of the present country. There was no such thing in the past!"

Dai Enjun was only fifteen years old when he left home to work as an apprentice in a private factory. He worked hard day and night, but in the end, he couldn't even afford a pair of shoes. His clothes were patched and re-patched, and he slept on a broken straw mat at night. When he was sick, the boss wouldn't even give him a glass of cold water. At that time, if he moved even a little slower, the boss would kick and punch him. One year, he contracted typhoid fever at the Changchun Xinjing Foundry. The factory director said he was faking illness and beat him with a stick. To survive, he had to get up.

After the liberation of Dalian, everything changed. Dai Enjun suffered from neurasthenia, and the leaders urged him to take a rest. At the sanatorium, he received meticulous care. Because he was a Hui, the sanatorium specially cooked dishes for him. Thinking of this, he became uneasy. He said he wanted to quickly recover and work hard after returning to the Dalian Mining Vehicle Factory.

Returning from the beach, the young nurses cordially summoned the convalescents to the medical room for injections or physical examinations. Although the diagnostic equipment in this medical room was not perfect, it was still quite good. There was a consulting room, a laboratory, a physiotherapy room, and a pharmacy. There were two doctors and three nurses. Currently, the physiotherapy room only had electrotherapy equipment, while hydrotherapy, mud therapy, and paraffin therapy equipment were being actively prepared. After receiving the injections, the old Doctor Huang and the convalescents sat on the large stone steps in front of the medical room and chatted happily. The convalescents affectionately called him "Old Dad." The old doctor also cared for each convalescent like his own children. Pan Yisheng, a technician who was recuperating, told me that only today did he receive such care from the country. During the puppet Manchukuo period, he had to go to work even when he was sick. Later, when he could no longer bear it, his companions borrowed money to send him to the hospital. After he was discharged, his salary had been deducted by the factory. When he saw that the draft constitution specifically stipulated that the state would provide material assistance to sick workers, he was deeply moved.

Three young female convalescents gazed at the green ocean bathed in sunlight, with the July sea breeze blowing on them. Lin Shuying, a 24-year-old female worker, felt an unspeakable relief as she stroked her body, which was recovering. She was an advanced producer at the Dalian-Lushun Canned Food Factory. During the intense production, she developed heart disease. The factory leaders cared for her very much and sent her to the Workers' Sanatorium for treatment. When she leaned on the railing and looked at the distant sky and sea, or strolled on the quiet hills, or walked in the beautiful small garden, she would naturally think of her current and past life. She was the daughter of a poor peasant, and now she had mastered advanced technology. When the draft constitution was announced, she immediately called the factory to ask her sisters in the group about their study of the draft constitution.

After lunch, the convalescents returned to their dormitories to rest.

After the afternoon nap, members of the Dalian-Lushun Basic Construction Cultural Service Team performed wonderful programs for the advanced construction workers and convalescents who came here for a holiday. At the venue, Ma Fuhai, a construction worker who had participated in the construction of the sanatorium, excitedly talked about his feelings. He was a special-grade labor model of the Dalian-Lushun Construction Company, and an advanced producer of Dalian-Lushun. He was forty years old this year, and he started working at the age of seventeen, enduring all kinds of hardships. He and his wife and children had lived in the doorway of other people's houses and had also wandered the streets. After the liberation of Dalian, under the care of the people's government, he had his own place to live. From his personal experience, he realized that today the lives of workers were guaranteed, and the state also stipulated these rights that workers should enjoy in the draft constitution.

At dusk, the guests left. Convalescents strolled on the beach in twos and threes. At this time, the waves gently lapped the shore, and many returning fishing boats dotted the peaceful beach. In the distance, a touch of afterglow of the setting sun remained on a range of rolling hills.

The sky gradually darkened, and the convalescents walked into the garden, crossed a small stone bridge, and gathered in the club. Some played billiards and table tennis; some played chess and cards; and some sang a happy song to the accompaniment of pleasant piano music.

    人民幸福的保证
    本报记者  傅冬  柏生
    清晨，还只有五点多，旅大工人疗养院的休养员就都醒了。推开床前的大玻璃窗，人们可以听见海浪轻轻拍打着岸边的声音。那辽阔平静的海洋，被风一吹，掀起细细的波浪。在远远的海面上，飘浮着几只帆船。望着这美丽的景色，人们都觉得自己是处身在图画中了。
    休养员吃过早餐以后，有的就坐在楼前小花园的长椅上眺望海上的美景和天上的云霞；有的坐在盛开的月季花前谈心；兴致高的，就跑到旁边山头上去散步。
    我们正和几个休养员谈论着的时候，忽然有人发现在海滩边一个楼房上插了许多红旗。“今天是什么节日呀！”一打听，原来旅大市基本建设先进工作者要来这里过假日。
    跑下山去一看，有些先进工作者已经来到了。会场周围挂着许多安全生产的图片和苏联基本建设先进经验的照片。五十九岁的休养员张兆刚，看完了画，又到临时成立的图书室溜了一圈。书可真不少呵！有连环画，有画报……玩的花样也不少，有说相声的，有合唱队……整个海滩都沸腾起来了。
    休养员戴恩君坐在岸边，望着涨起来的浪潮，和岸边的白色浪花，他感慨地说：“人们的辛勤劳动，给生活带来了多少欢乐和愉快呵！”接着他说：“可是这些事情都只有在新社会里才会出现，只有在现在的国家的宪法上才会明文规定。过去那会有这样的事！”
    戴恩君还只有十五岁的时候，就离家到一家私人工厂去当学徒。他没白天没黑夜地拼命干，到末了连双鞋子都买不起，身上的衣服补了又补，晚上盖着破草包睡觉；病了，掌柜连碗凉水都不给送。那时，动作稍微慢一点，掌柜的就拳打脚踢。有一年他在长春新京铸造厂得了伤寒。厂长说他装病，拿棍子打他。为了生活，他不得不爬起来。
    大连解放后，一切都变了。戴恩君神经衰弱，领导方面就催他去休养。到了疗养院，得到无微不至的照顾。因为他是回民，院里专门给他做菜。想到这，他不安起来，他说他要赶快把身体养好，回到大连工矿车辆厂后，努力工作。
    从海滩上回来，年轻的护理员们亲切地召唤着休养员们，要他们到医务室里去打针或检查身体。在这个医务室里，诊疗的设备虽然不十分完善，但总算还不错。这里有诊察室、化验室、理疗室，还有药房。有两个大夫和三个护士。目前，理疗室里只有电疗的设备，水疗、泥疗和蜡疗的设备正在积极准备中。在打完针以后，年老的黄大夫和休养员们坐在医务室门前的大石阶上愉快地畅谈着，休养员们亲切地唤他老爸爸。老大夫也像关心自己的儿女一样，关怀着每一个休养员。正在疗养的技术工人潘义升对我说，只有在今天，他才受到国家这样的关怀。在伪满时期，他病了还得到工厂去干活，后来人实在不行了，伙伴们才东借西凑地把他送进了医院；出了院，工资已经被厂方扣光了。当他看到宪法草案中特别规定国家对有病的劳动者给以物质的帮助时，他深深地感动了。
    三个年轻的女休养员眺望着沐浴在阳光中的绿色海洋，七月的海风吹拂着她们。二十四岁的女工林淑英，抚摸着快要恢复健康的身体，感到一种说不出的欣慰。她是旅大罐头食品工厂的先进生产者。在紧张的生产中，她患了心脏病。工厂领导方面十分关怀她，送她到工人疗养院来疗养。当她倚栏眺望着远天和海水的时候，或是漫步在幽静的小山上，或是散步在美丽的小花园中的时候，她都会很自然地联想起自己今天和过去的生活。她是一个穷苦农民的女儿，现在，她已掌握了先进的技术。当宪法草案公布时，她立刻打电话到工厂里，问小组里的姊妹们学习宪法草案的情况。
    午饭以后，休养员都回到宿舍里休息。
    午睡起来以后，旅大市基本建设文化服务队的队员们为来到这里过休假日的先进建筑工人以及休养员们演出了精采的节目。在会场上，曾经参加过疗养院修建工程的建筑工人马福海，兴奋地谈了自己的感触。他是旅大建筑公司的一个特等劳动模范，旅大市的先进生产者。他今年四十岁，十七岁他就开始做工，受尽了苦难。他和他的妻子和孩子，曾经住在别人家的门洞里，也曾在街头流浪过。大连解放以后，他在人民政府的关怀下，有了自己的住处。从切身的体会中，他认识到今天工人的生活有了保障，国家还把劳动者应该享受的这些权利规定在宪法草案中。
    黄昏时，嘉宾们离开了。休养员们三三两两在海滩上散步，这时海浪轻轻地拍打着海岸，许多归来的渔船点缀着宁静的海滩。远处一片起伏着的山峦上，留下一抹夕阳的余辉。
    天色逐渐黑了下来，休养员们走进了花园，穿过一座小石桥，聚到俱乐部里来。有的玩克郎球、乒乓球；有的下象棋，玩扑克；有的和着悦耳的琴声，唱起一支幸福的歌曲。
