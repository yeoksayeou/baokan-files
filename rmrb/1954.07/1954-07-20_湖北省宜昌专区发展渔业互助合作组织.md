Yichang Prefecture, Hubei Province Develops Fishery Mutual Aid and Cooperation Organizations

Yichang Prefecture, Hubei Province, is actively developing fishery mutual aid and cooperation organizations. In the four counties of Dangyang, Yichang, etc., in the eastern part of the prefecture, there are rivers such as the Yangtze River, the Zhang River, and the Qing River, as well as many lakes and reservoirs scattered throughout the area, which are rich in fish. Fishermen account for one-fifth of the population in the areas along the rivers and lakes. Because the fishermen operate in a decentralized manner, fish production increases very little each year. In order to greatly increase the production of freshwater fish and meet the needs of the people, the area is actively developing fishery mutual aid and cooperation organizations. The backbone training class for the pilot fishery production cooperative in the area has ended. It is planned to first establish three fishery production cooperatives in Yichang, Yidu, and Zhijiang counties at the end of July. The Commissioner's Office and various counties have allocated cadres to run the cooperatives. In order to strengthen the leadership of fishery mutual aid and cooperation, the Commissioner's Office has established an aquatic products section, and the counties have also strengthened the leadership of the existing nineteen permanent fishery mutual aid groups, in preparation for the large-scale development of fishery production cooperatives this winter and next spring. In order to make full use of the reservoirs to develop freshwater fish, the Commissioner's Office has now released one million fish fry into the largest Shiziling Reservoir in the area. At the same time, the Hubei Provincial People's Government has allocated more than 200 million yuan as funding for fish farming in this reservoir. Before autumn this year, 90,000 fish fry will also be released into four large reservoirs, including Yujia Chong in Dangyang.

    湖北省宜昌专区发展渔业互助合作组织
    湖北省宜昌专区积极发展渔业互助合作组织。该专区东部当阳、宜昌等四县境内，有长江、漳河、清江等河流，还有许多湖沼水库散布各地，盛产鱼类。沿江沿湖地带五分之一的人口是渔民。由于渔民们分散经营，每年鱼产很少增加。为了大量增产淡水鱼，满足人民生活需要，该区积极发展渔业互助合作组织。该区试办渔业生产合作社的骨干训练班已经结束。准备七月底先在宜昌、宜都、枝江三县建立三个渔业生产合作社，专署和各县已配备了办社干部。为了加强对渔业互助合作的领导，该专署成立了水产科，各县也加强了对现有十九个渔业常年互助组的领导，为今冬明春大量发展渔业生产合作社做准备。为了充分利用水库发展淡水鱼，专署现已在该区最大的石子岭水库放养了一百万条鱼秧，同时湖北省人民政府还拨了二亿多万元作为这座水库养鱼经费。当阳喻家冲等四个大水库今年秋前也将放养鱼秧九万尾。
