    At the end of April this year, the Uyghur farmers of the Fifth Township in Seman District, Shufu County, Xinjiang Province, established the Xindao Agricultural Production Cooperative. Tursun Mamat was elected as the director of the cooperative by all its members.
    Tursun Mamat worked as a farmhand for landlords from a young age. In the spring of 1952, during the land reform, he was allocated land and honorably joined the Chinese Communist Party.
    In the spring of last year, the township launched a mutual aid and cooperation movement. Tursun Mamat was the first to respond to the call of the Party and the People's Government and organized a mutual aid team with five farming households. Initially, the team members were very enthusiastic, but later, due to the lack of a sound scoring and work recording system, disunity occurred within the team, causing the mutual aid team to collapse for a time. With the help of Party Branch Secretary Shawuer, Tursun Mamat formulated a scoring and work recording system. This brought everyone back to the team. In June, wheat in the township suffered from jaundice. The People's Government mobilized farmers to use sprayers to apply pesticide powder for prevention and control. Tursun Mamat took the lead in using sprayers to apply pesticide powder, and then mobilized team members and other farmers to prevent and control pests and diseases, quickly suppressing the spread of jaundice. During the summer harvest, Tursun Mamat's mutual aid team's 34 mu of winter wheat fields yielded an average of 549 jin of wheat per mu, exceeding the local average yield per mu by 43 percent. Among them, three mu of high-yield fields yielded 723 jin per mu, creating the highest record of wheat yield in the area. After the autumn harvest, this mutual aid team was rated as a high-yield mutual aid team in the township by the masses.
    In February of this year, Tursun Mamat was transferred to the mutual aid and cooperation training class held by the Kashgar Local Committee of the Communist Party of China. After graduation, he returned to the village and went door-to-door to publicize the general task of the state during the transition period to the farmers. After listening to his publicity, the farmers asked to join the mutual aid team one after another. At the beginning of March, the Kashgar Local Committee of the Communist Party of China decided to pilot two agricultural production cooperatives in this township, one of which was the "Xindao" Agricultural Production Cooperative established on the basis of Tursun Mamat's mutual aid team. During the establishment of the cooperative, Tursun Mamat first contributed his land and draught animals to the cooperative, and helped some members eliminate ideological concerns. Under his influence, several members who were originally hesitant also voluntarily joined the cooperative.

    共产党员吐逊买买提
    新华社记者　韩文慧、艾海提
    今年四月底，新疆省疏附县赛满区五乡维吾尔族农民成立了新道农业生产合作社，吐逊买买提被全体社员推选为这个社的主任。
  吐逊买买提从小就给地主做长工，到一九五二年春天土地改革时，他分到了土地，并光荣地加入了中国共产党。
    去年春天，乡里开展了互助合作运动，吐逊买买提首先响应党和人民政府的号召，和五户农民组织了一个互助组。起初，组员热情很高，后来由于没有健全的评分、记工制度，组内发生了不团结现象，使互助组一度垮台。吐逊买买提在党支部书记沙吾尔的帮助下，制定了评分、记工的制度。这样，大家才又回到组里来。六月间，乡里小麦发生了黄疸病，人民政府动员农民用喷雾器洒药粉防治，吐逊买买提首先用喷雾器洒药粉防治，然后动员组员和其他农民防治病虫害，很快扑灭了黄疸病的蔓延。夏收时，吐逊买买提互助组的三十四亩冬麦地，每亩平均收了五百四十九斤小麦，超过当地每亩平均产量百分之四十三，其中三亩丰产田每亩收了七百二十三斤，创造了当地小麦产量的最高纪录。秋收后，这个互助组被群众评为全乡丰产互助组。
    今年二月，吐逊买买提被调到中共喀什地方委员会举办的互助合作训练班学习。结业后，他回到村里挨门挨户地向农民宣传国家过渡时期的总任务。农民听了他的宣传后，纷纷要求参加互助组。三月初，中共喀什地方委员会决定在这个乡试办两个农业生产合作社，其中一个就是在吐逊买买提互助组的基础上建立起来的“新道”农业生产合作社。在建社期间，吐逊买买提首先把土地和耕畜入了社，并帮助有些社员消除思想顾虑。在他的影响下，原来犹疑不决的几个社员也自愿入社了。
