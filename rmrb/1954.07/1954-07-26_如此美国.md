Such is America

    "Supreme Inner Cabinet"
    According to a New York dispatch from the United Press, the real power in the United States today is held by a "National Security Council" composed of fifteen people, which some call the "Supreme Inner Cabinet" of the United States, or even a "Wartime Cabinet in Peacetime." It is said that all important matters must first be decided by this mysterious group.
    Who are the members of the "National Security Council"? Look at the list! At the head is Robert Cutler, the chairman of the "National Security Council" selected by the President of the United States, a man known as a "mysterious figure" in the White House. He was formerly the head of a large trust company, and it is said that his power is second only to the President of the United States, even higher than the Secretary of State. The members under Cutler are: Secretary of State Dulles, Under Secretary of State Smith, Secretary of Defense Wilson, Secretary of the Army Stevens, Secretary of the Navy Anderson, Secretary of the Air Force Talbott, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Radford, Army Chief of Staff Ridgway, Chief of Naval Operations Carney, Air Force Chief of Staff Twining, Director of the Central Intelligence Agency Allen Dulles, Director of the Foreign Operations Administration Stassen, Director of the Office of Defense Mobilization Flemming, and Secretary of the Treasury Humphrey.
    Indeed, everyone is very familiar with these figures. Here is Dulles, the chief culprit in instigating the war of aggression against Korea; Ridgway, the executioner stained with the blood of the Korean people; Radford, the war-monger shouting to send troops to slaughter the people of Indochina; and Allen Dulles, the special agent who specializes in persecuting the American people. This is a string of names filled with the smell of gunpowder.
    It is these figures who are manipulating American domestic and foreign policies, dominating everything in the United States, and leading the United States onto an increasingly dangerous and isolated path of war.

    Poisoning Children
    In an elementary school in Queens, New York, while elementary school students were crawling under a piece of cloth for an air raid drill, the principal walked into the classroom, looked around, and suddenly pointed at some elementary school students and shouted, "Your right arm is burned off! Your leg is gone! Half of your face is burned off!" When a teacher asked him why he was scaring the elementary school students like this, the principal replied, "They didn't cover themselves well enough. They must be scared like this so they won't forget."
    The American rulers are not only creating a terrifying atmosphere of war among adults, but also using this evil war-mongering to poison the minds of children. Hershey, the director of the US Selective Service System, once said that what they need in America is "not scholars, but soldiers." All this fully illustrates the true face of fascist education in the United States today.

      Racial Discrimination
    Recently, according to James Shaw, the chief medical officer of the Bureau of Indian Affairs of the US Department of the Interior, the US authorities' medical work for the Indians in the country is simply terrible. The average life expectancy of Indians is now less than twenty years. The mortality rate for infants and young children is three to four times that of white people, the incidence of tuberculosis is about six times, and the incidence of pneumonia, influenza, and gastroenteritis is about four times. Among the younger generation, the mortality rate for these patients is eight to ten times that of white people.
    These simple and powerful figures have clearly formed a tragic picture of racial discrimination in the United States.

      Hard to Find Work
    Now is the summer vacation, and thousands of American students want to take advantage of the summer vacation to find temporary work to increase their meager income. But according to the "Wall Street Journal," it is much more difficult to find temporary work this year than usual. According to some figures, the number of people looking for temporary work is one and a half times more than a year ago. A bank clerk in Los Angeles said that the number of students looking for temporary work this year is "the most I have seen in my twenty-four years of service." A staff member of a student job search office said, "There are a hundred applicants for every vacancy." Even jobs as soda fountain clerks, bartenders, waiters in restaurants and hotels, and unskilled agricultural work are hard to find. Four hundred college students at Washington University in St. Louis initially refused to do unskilled work, but now they agree to do any work.
    On January 4 this year, the President of the United States boasted to the American people that he would establish a plan to make "all Americans prosper continuously." The increasing number of students seeking temporary work during the summer vacation is probably one of the scenes of this "prosperity"!

    如此美国
    “太上内阁”
    据合众社纽约的消息说，在今天的美国，实际掌握国家大权的是一个由十五人组成的“国家安全委员会”，有人称它是美国的“太上内阁”，甚至称它是“和平时期的战争内阁”。据说，一切重要问题，都要先由这个神秘的集团去作决定。
    “国家安全委员会”是由那些人组成的呢？看看它的名单吧！为首的罗伯特·卡特勒，是美国总统挑选的“国家安全委员会”的主席，一个被称为白宫的“神秘人物”的人，过去他是一家大信托公司的首脑，据说他现在的权力仅次于美国总统，比国务卿还高。卡特勒以下的委员是：国务卿杜勒斯、副国务卿史密斯、国防部部长威尔逊、陆军部部长斯蒂文斯，海军部部长安德逊、空军部部长泰尔波特、参谋长联席会议主席雷德福、陆军参谋长李奇微、海军作战部部长卡湼、空军参谋长特文宁、中央情报局局长艾伦·杜勒斯、援外事务管理署署长史塔生、国防动员署署长弗莱明和财政部部长汉弗莱。
    的确，大家对这些人物一点也不生疏。这里有策动侵略朝鲜战争的主犯杜勒斯，有沾满朝鲜人民鲜血的刽子手李奇微，有喊着要派兵去屠杀印度支那人民的战争叫嚣者雷德福，还有专门迫害美国人民的特务头子艾伦·杜勒斯。这是一串充满了火药气味的名字。
    正是这些人物在操纵着美国的内外政策，主宰着美国的一切，把美国引向越来越危险、越来越孤立的战争道路上去了。毒化儿童
    在纽约昆士区一所小学校里，小学生们正爬在一块布下面作防空演习时，校长走进课堂看了一遍以后，突然指着一些小学生大声嚷着：“你的右胳膊被烧掉了！你的腿不在了！你的半个脸被烧得没有了！”一个教员问他为什么这样恐吓小学生，这个校长回答说：“他们没有很好地把自己盖好，必需这样恐吓他们，他们就不会忘记了。”
    美国统治者不但在成年人中间制造恐怖的战争空气，而且还用这种罪恶的战争叫嚣，来毒化儿童们的心灵。美国征兵局局长赫尔希曾经说，在他们美国需要的“不是学者，而是兵士”。这一切充分地说明了今天美国法西斯教育的真面目。
      种族歧视
    最近，据美国内政部印第安人事务局主任医官詹姆斯·萧说，美国当局对国内印第安人的医疗工作简直糟糕透了，现在印第安人的寿命平均还不到二十岁。婴儿和幼儿的死亡率为白种人的三倍到四倍，患肺结核的约为六倍，患肺炎、流行性感冒和肠胃炎的约四倍。在年轻的一代中间，这些病人的死亡率为白种人的八倍到十倍。
    这些简单有力的数字，已经十分明显地构成了美国种族歧视下的一幅悲惨的图画。
      找工作难
    现在正是暑假期间，美国成千的学生，都想利用暑假临时找点工作，增加一点少得可怜的收入。但是据“华尔街日报”记载，今年要找临时工作的比往常更困难得多了，据一些数字缩小了的材料看，这种找临时工作的人比一年前多了一倍半。洛杉矶一个银行职员说，今年来找临时工作的学生“是我在职二十四年来最多的一年”。一个学生寻找工作办事处的工作人员说：“每一个空额就有一百个人申请”，就是连冷饮店的售货员，酒吧间、饭馆和旅馆的侍者以及农业上不熟练的工作，也很难找到。圣路易的华盛顿大学的四百名大学生起初不愿做不熟练的工作，现在什么工作都同意了。
    今年一月四日，美国总统曾向美国人民吹嘘，他要建立一个什么计划，使美国“所有的人不断繁荣”。利用暑假找寻临时工作的学生越来越多，大概就是这种“繁荣”的景象之一吧！
