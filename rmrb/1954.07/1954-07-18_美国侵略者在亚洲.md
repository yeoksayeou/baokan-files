American Aggressors in Asia

	To Profit from Another's Misfortune
	Under the strong pressure of the Vietnamese People's Army, French colonial troops recently withdrew from large areas south of the Red River Delta. This event aroused dissatisfaction in the United States. Moreover, the United States is trying to profit from another's misfortune by attempting to seize the right to train the Bao Dai army. Therefore, American officials encouraged the Bao Dai army, saying that if they were trained, they "could become a good fighting force."
	It is known that the Bao Dai army is mostly equipped with guns and cannons that the French colonialists obtained from the United States, and in the past year, the United States has invested in the Indochina War (more than one billion U.S. dollars), which is equivalent to four-fifths of the total expenditure of this war. But what about the combat effectiveness of these troops? Reuters Singapore, July 2, reported that past statistics on casualties in the Bao Dai army were calculated at "one dead, three wounded, and nine missing." Now, it is "entire units disappearing overnight." Where did they "disappear" to? They all surrendered to the Vietnamese People's Army.
	The American aggressors, boasting that they would train an army with such low morale into a "good fighting force," only makes it clear that U.S. imperialism is simply trying to find an opportunity to further intervene in Indochina and expand its aggressive forces.

	Insidious "Expedition"
	According to a TASS dispatch from Delhi on July 10, a group of so-called "mountain expeditions" from the United States recently arrived in Nepal. The correspondent of the Indian "Blitz" weekly in Calcutta said that this expedition included an American Air Force instructor and some well-known American bacteriologists, who paid special attention to the strategic areas on the border between Nepal and Chinese Tibet. Moreover, they had access to American military aircraft.
	"Explorers" who travel in military planes and pay special attention to the strategic areas of other countries' borders, like the American "archaeologists" who ran to Afghanistan near the Soviet border more than four months ago to study sheep and goats, cannot help but make people suspect their ulterior motives.

	Unexpected Disasters
	According to the Delhi "Indian Times," the 500 tons of rotten wheat from American "aid" parked in the Karachi port recently caused a lot of trouble for the Pakistani authorities, and merchants demanded that the government not supply this useless stuff to consumers. This shows how dissatisfied the local people are with American "aid."
	However, the people of Pakistan are lucky, because they have not yet eaten this American wheat. Recently, many people in Yamagata Prefecture, Japan, have suffered from diarrhea, and very severe diarrhea, because they ate American rice distributed by the Yoshida government. This incident has aroused protests from people all over Japan.
	The people of Pakistan and Japan see that American "aid," in addition to causing their countries to lose independence and freedom, has also brought them many unexpected disasters, including diarrhea. Therefore, they are increasingly opposed to this so-called "aid."

	The Poisonous Effects of American Films
	On June 19, 13,000 women in Delhi, India, demanded that the authorities stop the poisonous effects of American films in India. In a petition, they said that American films have "increasingly become a great threat to the normal health of our (Indian) children. These films tempt children to develop precocious sexual habits, tempt them to commit crimes, and become an important factor in creating social unrest."
	American apologist psychologists once said that these American films that poison children play a "very good guiding role" for American children. But Indian women have already seen what kind of path this "very good guiding role" has "guided" their children to. For the sake of their children, they must resolutely oppose this "guidance" and oppose the United States imposing its way of life on the Indian people.

    美国侵略者在亚洲
    为的是趁火打劫
    在越南人民军的强大压力下，最近法国殖民军队撤出了红河三角洲南部的大片土地。这件事引起了美国的不满。而且美国趁火打劫，企图夺取对保大军队的训练权。于是美国官员们给保大军队打气说，如果把他们加以训练后，就“可以成为一支很好的作战力量”。
    人们知道，保大军队大部分是法国殖民者从美国拿来的枪炮装备起来的，最近一年美国投入印度支那战争的费用（十亿美元以上），等于这个战争全部支出的五分之四。然而这些军队的作战力怎样呢？路透社新加坡七月二日电讯说，过去统计保大军队的死伤，是以“一死三伤九失踪的程度来计算”，现在是“整个部队一夜之间全失踪了”。“失踪”到那里去了呢？原来都投降到越南人民军那边去了。
    士气低落到这种地步的军队，美国侵略者还吹嘘要把它训练成一支“很好的作战力量”，这就更可以使人们看出美帝国主义无非是要找到机会进一步插手到印度支那来扩大它的侵略势力。别有用心的“探险队”
    据塔斯社德里七月十日的消息，最近，有一批美国的所谓“高山探险队”到达尼泊尔，印度“闪电”周报驻加尔各答记者说，这个探险队里有一名美国空军教官和一些著名的美国细菌学家，他们特别注意尼泊尔和中国西藏边境的战略地区。而且，还有美国军用飞机供他们使用。
    坐着军用飞机、专门注意人家边界上的战略地区的“探险家”，和四个多月以前跑到靠近苏联边境的阿富汗去研究什么绵羊和山羊的美国“考古家”一样，怎能不使人们怀疑他们别有用心呢？意料不到的灾难
    据德里“印度时报”消息，最近在喀喇蚩港口停放的五百吨美国“援助”的腐烂小麦，给巴基斯坦当局添了不少麻烦，商人们要求政府不要把这种没有用处的东西供销给消费者。可见当地人民对美国的“援助”多么不满。
    但是，巴基斯坦人民总算幸运，因为他们还没有把这些美国小麦吃下去。而最近日本山形县的人民就是因为吃了吉田政府配给他们的美国大米，许多人都泻肚子，而且泻得很严重。这件事已引起日本各地人民的抗议。
    巴基斯坦和日本人民看到，美国的“援助”除掉使他们的国家丧失独立和自由以外，还给他们带来了许多意料不到的灾难，包括泻肚子在内。因此，他们也越加反对这种所谓“援助”了。美国电影的流毒
    六月十九日，印度德里有一万三千名妇女，要求当局制止在印度的美国电影流毒。她们在一封请愿书上说，美国影片已“日益成为对我国（印度）儿童的正常健康的巨大威胁。这种影片引诱儿童们染上早熟的性习惯，引诱他们去犯罪，成为造成社会不安的重要因素”。
    美国的御用心理学家们曾经说，这种毒害儿童的美国影片对美国儿童起着“极好的诱导作用”。可是印度妇女们已经看到这种“极好的诱导作用”把她们的孩子“诱导”到什么样的路上去了。为着她们的孩子，她们不能不坚决反对这种“诱导”，反对美国把它的生活方式强加在印度人民身上。
