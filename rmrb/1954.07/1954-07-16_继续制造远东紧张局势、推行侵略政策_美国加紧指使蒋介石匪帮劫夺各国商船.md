Xinhua News Agency, July 15th:

    The US authorities are intensifying their instigation of the traitor Chiang Kai-shek to frantically undermine the basic principles of international law, plunder merchant ships of various countries sailing on the high seas, and obstruct the normal development of shipping and trade in the Far East.
    After instigating the Chiang gang to plunder the Soviet oil tanker "Tuapse," the US authorities on the 13th directed an organization under Chiang's control to openly issue provocative threats that it would continue to plunder the shipping vessels of other countries, intimidating countries that wish to develop shipping and trade in the Far East. In order to intensify these piratical actions and expand its aggression against the People's Republic of China, the US authorities recently transferred two destroyers and three patrol boats to Chiang Kai-shek, and will soon continue to transfer six warships and a batch of jet aircraft to him.
    All countries concerned about the development of international trade and the safety of navigation on the high seas should pay serious attention to the increasingly rampant piratical actions of the US authorities and their running dog, Chiang Kai-shek. Since 1950, when the US instigated the Chiang gang to carry out these piratical activities, the shipping vessels of many countries have been directly damaged by these destructive actions, including dozens of British ships and ships from the Soviet Union, Poland, West Germany, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, Italy, Greece, Portugal, Panama, and other countries. Under the instigation and assistance of the US authorities, the Chiang gang has ordered its personnel to wantonly plunder, attack, and search the shipping vessels of various countries, rob and confiscate the goods carried by these ships, and beat, insult, and even kill the personnel on these ships. On December 1, 1952, the Chiang gang's gunboats attacked a British merchant ship, and the British captain of the ship, Robert Adams, was shot dead by machine guns. The facts are very clear that if these destructive activities of the US authorities and their running dogs are not stopped, international shipping and international trade will be further threatened, and the interests of various countries will be more seriously damaged.
    The US authorities shamelessly and desperately deny that they are related to these lawless activities of the Chiang gang, attempting to shirk the serious responsibility for these destructive actions. However, everyone knows that the Chiang gang's destructive activities are carried out with the full support of the US authorities. The ships used by the Chiang gang to carry out piratical activities are supplied by the US, and these destructive activities are carried out using Taiwan, our country's territory occupied by the US, as a base, and in the waters controlled by the US Navy. Moreover, these destructive activities are carried out with the direct participation and assistance of the US Air Force and Navy. Drew Pearson, a columnist for the US "Daily Mirror," admitted that before the Soviet oil tanker "Tuapse" was detained, the US Navy sent a seaplane to circle over it for a long time. "This aircraft maintained direct contact with the Chinese Kuomintang elements and informed them where to find this Soviet oil tanker." Before the Polish merchant ship "Praca" was plundered, an aircraft with US Air Force markings circled over it for reconnaissance, directing the Chiang gang's navy to intercept it. It is quite obvious that the US war-mongering clique is the real culprit of these piratical actions that violate the freedom of navigation on the high seas and undermine international regulations. It must bear full responsibility for the serious consequences caused by these actions.
    The US authorities' intensified instigation of the Chiang gang to carry out these piratical actions is a step in its determination to continue to pursue its war policy of creating tension in the Far East and expanding its aggression against China. The Geneva Conference on the peaceful settlement of the Indochina issue is gradually breaking through the obstruction and sabotage of the United States and entering a decisive and important stage. At the same time, with the progress of international consultation, more and more countries and people are demanding the rapid establishment of normal relations with the People's Republic of China and the resumption and promotion of economic and cultural exchanges. The US authorities are extremely hostile to this situation, and therefore vainly attempt to intensify the use of this piratical behavior and other aggressive acts to strengthen their war activities against the People's Republic of China and maintain and deepen the tension in the Far East. The entire Chinese people express great indignation at this war policy and aggressive actions of the US war-mongering clique, which is determined to be the enemy of our 600 million people. We must strengthen our vigilance, strengthen our peaceful construction, and fight to the end to finally recover Taiwan and smash the piratical actions of the United States.

    继续制造远东紧张局势、推行侵略政策
    美国加紧指使蒋介石匪帮劫夺各国商船
    【新华社十五日讯】美国当局正在加紧指使卖国贼蒋介石猖狂地破坏国际法的基本准则，劫夺在公海上航行的各国商船，阻挠远东航运和贸易的正常发展。
    美国当局在指使蒋匪劫夺苏联油船“图阿普斯”号以后，又在十三日指使蒋匪控制下的机构公然发出挑衅性的威胁，将继续劫夺其他国家的航运船只，对愿望发展远东航运和贸易的各国进行恫吓。为了加紧进行这种海盗行动并扩大对中华人民共和国的侵略，美国当局又在最近移交给蒋介石两艘驱逐舰和三艘巡逻艇，并且不久将继续移交给他六艘军舰和一批喷气式飞机。
    对美国当局以及它的走狗蒋介石的日益猖獗的海盗行动，所有关心国际贸易的开展和公海航行的安全的国家都应该引起严重的注意。自一九五零年美国指使蒋匪进行这种海盗活动以来，许多国家的航运船只直接受到了这种破坏行动的损害，其中包括英国的数十艘船只和苏联、波兰、西德、挪威、丹麦、荷兰、意大利、希腊、葡萄牙、巴拿马等国的船只。蒋匪在美国当局的指使和协助下，令他的人员恣意劫夺、袭击和搜查各国的航运船只，抢劫和没收这些船只载运的货物，殴打、侮辱甚至杀害这些船只上的人员。一九五二年十二月一日，蒋匪的炮艇对一艘英国商船进行袭击，这艘商船的英国籍船长罗伯特·亚当斯被机关枪打死。事实十分清楚，如果不制止美国当局和它的走狗的这种破坏活动，国际航运和国际贸易将受到更大的威胁，各国的利益将受到更加严重的损害。
    美国当局厚颜无耻地竭力否认它和蒋匪的这种无法无天的活动有关，企图推卸这种破坏行动的严重责任。但是，大家知道，蒋匪的这种破坏活动是在美国当局的完全支持下进行的。蒋匪进行海盗活动的舰艇是美国供给的，他的这种破坏活动是利用美国侵占的我国领土台湾为基地，在美国海军控制的海面进行的。而且，这种破坏活动是在美国海空军的直接参加和协助之下进行的。美国“每日镜报”专栏作家德鲁·皮尔逊承认，在苏联油船“图阿普斯”号被扣留以前，美国海军派出一架水上飞机在它的上空盘旋了好久。“这架飞机和中国国民党分子保持直接的联系，并通知他们到哪里去找这艘苏联油船。”在波兰商船“布拉卡”号被劫夺以前，也有一架带着美国空军标志的飞机在它的上空盘旋侦察，指挥蒋匪海军进行截击。十分明显，美国好战集团就是这种侵犯公海航行自由和破坏国际法规的海盗行动的真正罪犯。它对于这种行动所造成的严重后果必须承担完全的责任。
    美国当局变本加厉地指使蒋匪进行这种海盗行动，是它决意继续推行的制造远东紧张局势和扩大侵略中国的战争政策的一个步骤。日内瓦会议关于和平解决印度支那问题正在逐步突破美国的阻挠和破坏而进入决定性的重要阶段。同时，随着国际协商的取得进展，越来越多的国家和人民要求迅速和中华人民共和国建立正常关系，并恢复和促进经济和文化的交流。美国当局对于这种情况极端仇恨，因此妄图加紧利用这种海盗行为以及其他侵略行为来加强对中华人民共和国的战争活动，并保持和加深远东紧张局势。全中国人民对美国好战集团这种坚决与我国六万万人民为敌的战争政策和侵略行动表示极大的愤慨。我们必须加强警惕，加强和平建设，并为最后收复台湾和粉碎美国的海盗行为而奋斗到底。
