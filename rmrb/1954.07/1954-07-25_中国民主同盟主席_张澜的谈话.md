The brilliant achievements of the Geneva Conference are a tremendous success in resolving international disputes through peaceful negotiation, and the greatest victory for peaceful and democratic forces. The agreement reached by the nine participating countries on the restoration of peace in Indochina extinguished the eight-year-long war in the region, bringing peace to the people of Indochina and the people of France, and proving to the people of the world that lasting peace can be achieved, and the conspiracies of warmongers are futile.

The achievements and process of the Geneva Conference have made it clearer to the world who loves peace and who advocates war. The US ruling clique's stubborn implementation of its policy of hostility to peace has left it in an unprecedentedly isolated position internationally. The tremendous contribution made by the peace and democracy camp, headed by the Soviet Union, to the achievement of this agreement vividly illustrates our unremitting efforts to defend peace and strive for the settlement of international disputes through consultation. The specific proposals of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, with the full support of the Chinese and Soviet delegations, provided a practical basis for the peaceful settlement of the Indochina issue, winning praise from world opinion.

As Premier Zhou pointed out in his speech at the Geneva Conference on July 21, "In order to safeguard collective peace in Asia, we believe that Asian countries should consult and cooperate with each other on the basis of mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence. At the same time, we are willing to work with countries outside Asia that share the same goal to safeguard peace and security in Asia and the world." The stipulation in the agreement that the three Indochinese countries will not participate in any military alliances and will not allow any foreign countries to establish military bases on their territories embodies this spirit, and this provision will become a strong guarantee for safeguarding peace in Southeast Asia.

For the first time, the People's Republic of China, as one of the world's major powers, consulted with major countries on major international issues, and made outstanding contributions to the restoration of peace in Indochina at this conference, which was warmly welcomed by the world. This is a concrete manifestation of the wise and correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao. The people of our country feel extremely excited and honored by the efforts and achievements of our delegation headed by Premier and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai, and express our heartfelt thanks.

    中国民主同盟主席
    张澜的谈话
    日内瓦会议的辉煌成就，是以和平协商方式解决国际争端的一次巨大的成就，是和平民主力量的最大胜利。参加会议的九个国家就恢复印度支那和平问题所取得的协议，扑灭了在这地区绵延八年的战火，把和平带给印度支那人民和法国人民，向全世界人民证明了持久和平是可以争取的，战争挑拨者的阴谋是枉然的。
    日内瓦会议的成就及其经过，使全世界更清楚地认识了，谁是爱好和平，谁是主张战争。美国统治集团顽固地实行它的敌视和平的政策，已使它在国际上陷于空前孤立的地位。以苏联为首的和平民主阵营对于此次达成协议所作的巨大贡献，生动地说明了我们保卫和平、争取以协商方式解决国际争端的不懈努力。越南民主共和国的具体建议，得到中、苏代表团的全力支持，为和平解决印度支那问题提供了切实的基础，博得了世界舆论的赞扬。
    正如周总理在七月二十一日的日内瓦会议上的发言中所指出的：“为了维护亚洲的集体和平，我们认为，亚洲国家彼此之间应该根据互相尊重领土主权、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利、和平共处的原则进行协商和合作。同时，我们并愿与抱着同一目的的亚洲以外的国家共同努力维护亚洲及世界的和平和安全。”印度支那三个国家在协议中规定不参加任何军事同盟，并不容许任何外国在它们的领土上建立军事基地，就体现了这种精神，这个规定将成为保障东南亚和平的有力保证。
    中华人民共和国第一次以世界大国之一的身份，与各大国一起协商重大国际问题，在这一会议中对恢复印度支那和平问题作出了卓越的贡献，受到全世界的热烈欢迎。这是中国共产党和毛主席的英明、正确的领导的具体表现。我国人民对于以周恩来总理兼外长为首的我国代表团的努力和成就，感到极大的兴奋和光荣，并表示衷心的感谢。
