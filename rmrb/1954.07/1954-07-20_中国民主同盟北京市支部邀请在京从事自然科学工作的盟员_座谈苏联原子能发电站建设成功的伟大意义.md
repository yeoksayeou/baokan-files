The Beijing Branch of the China Democratic League invited League members working in natural sciences in Beijing to hold a symposium on the 13th to discuss the great significance of the completion of the first Soviet atomic energy power station. The meeting was presided over by Zeng Zhaolun, member of the Beijing Branch of the China Democratic League and Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Higher Education of the Central People's Government. Speakers included Xu Jie, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Geology of the Central People's Government; Chu Shenglin, Director of the Physics Department of Peking University; Zhang Jiucheng, Deputy Chief Engineer of the Maritime Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Communications of the Central People's Government; Chen Zongqi, Deputy Director of the General Office of the Chinese Academy of Sciences; Liu Jingxiang, Dean of Studies of the Beijing Railway Institute; Ye Duzhuang, Director of the Compilation Committee of the North China Agricultural Science Institute; and Zhang Zhaoqian, Deputy Director of the Institute of Botany of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

In their speeches, everyone unanimously believed that the construction of the Soviet atomic energy power station brought a new era to mankind, which fully demonstrated the superiority of the socialist society, proving that in the Soviet Union, science truly serves peaceful construction; it also gave Chinese scientific workers great encouragement. Chu Shenglin said: The construction of an atomic energy power station in the Soviet Union is the first in the world, which is inseparable from the superiority of the Soviet socialist system.

The meeting also pointed out the fact that in capitalist countries, the hard-won achievements of many scientific workers are stifled. There, science is used to seek greater profits for monopoly capitalists. Zeng Zhaolun said: Imperialists have also promoted the idea of ​​researching the use of atomic energy in industry, but that is just a façade. In reality, they use science as a weapon to kill people, to blackmail and plunder.

At the symposium, everyone also talked about the situation of scientific research in our country and the importance of combining scientific research with production and practice. Everyone expressed their willingness to learn from the Soviet Union and actively engage in scientific research for the socialist construction of the motherland. Xu Jie said: Our country's social system and rich resources provide superior conditions for scientific research workers. What is needed now is our own redoubled efforts. Scientific research workers must be ahead of production and construction, playing a guiding role in production, and not be behind production and construction. Finally, everyone also expressed their willingness to do more publicity work to make people further understand the great significance of the successful construction of the Soviet atomic energy power station.

    中国民主同盟北京市支部邀请在京从事自然科学工作的盟员
    座谈苏联原子能发电站建设成功的伟大意义
    中国民主同盟北京市支部曾在十三日邀请在京从事自然科学工作的盟员举行座谈会，座谈苏联第一个原子能发电站建成的伟大意义。会议由中国民主同盟北京市支部委员、中央人民政府高等教育部副部长曾昭抡主持，会上先后发言的有中央人民政府地质部副部长许杰，北京大学物理系主任褚圣麟，中央人民政府交通部海运管理总局副总工程师张九成，中国科学院办公厅副主任陈宗器，北京铁道学院教务长刘景向，华北农业科学研究所编译委员会主任叶笃庄，中国科学院植物研究所副所长张肇骞等。
    大家在发言中一致认为：苏联原子能发电站的建成给人类带来了新纪元，这充分说明了社会主义社会的优越性，证明在苏联科学是真正为和平建设服务的；同时也给中国科学工作者以极大的鼓舞。褚圣麟说：苏联建成原子能发电站，在世界上还是第一次，这同苏联的社会主义社会制度的优越性是分不开的。
    会上还指出在资本主义国家里许多科学工作者苦心研究的成果被扼杀的事实，在那里，科学被用来为垄断资本家谋取更大的利润。曾昭抡说：帝国主义也曾宣传要研究把原子能用在工业上，但那只是装门面的说法，它实际上是把科学作为杀人的武器来进行讹诈和掠夺。
    座谈会上，大家还谈到我国科学研究工作的情况和科学研究结合生产、结合实际的重要性，大家都表示要认真向苏联学习，为祖国的社会主义建设积极从事科学研究工作。许杰说：我国的社会制度和丰富资源都为科学研究工作者提供了优越的条件，现在所需要的是我们自己加倍努力。科学研究工作者要走在生产建设的前面，对生产起指导作用，而不能让它落在生产建设的后面。最后大家还表示要多作宣传工作，使人们进一步了解苏联原子能发电站建设成功的重大意义。
