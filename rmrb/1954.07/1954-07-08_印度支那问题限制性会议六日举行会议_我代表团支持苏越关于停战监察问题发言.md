Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, July 6th: The following communiqué was issued regarding the restrictive conference on the Indochina peace issue held in Geneva on the 6th:

"The delegations of the nine countries continued to discuss the issue of restoring peace in Indochina at the restrictive meeting on July 6th. The next restrictive meeting will be held on July 9th."

Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, July 6th: According to information obtained here, our correspondent reports: The Chinese delegation made a statement at the restrictive meeting held on the 6th. It is understood that in its statement, the Chinese delegation expressed its support for the statements made by the Soviet and Democratic Republic of Vietnam delegations at the previous two meetings. It also pointed out that several statements made by the French delegation regarding the ceasefire supervision issue should also be brought to the attention of the conference. The Chinese delegation also believes that as long as the conference continues to negotiate in a spirit of reconciliation, the differences on the ceasefire supervision issue can be gradually eliminated.

Regarding the issue of the relationship between the Joint Commission and the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, the Chinese delegation pointed out that, as always, the Soviet, Chinese, and Democratic Republic of Vietnam delegations have believed that the relationship between the two commissions should be parallel rather than subordinate. The French delegation has also indicated that there is no need to make the Joint Commission subordinate to the Neutral Nations Commission. Since the opinions of the conference on this issue are so close, the conference is in a position to determine the scope of authority of the two commissions based on the principle of parallel work between the two commissions. Therefore, the Chinese delegation believes that it is entirely possible for the conference to formulate a draft resolution on the scope of authority of the two commissions, based on the Soviet delegation's proposal of June 14th and the French delegation's proposal of June 25th, that can achieve agreement.

Regarding the question of whether the recommendations of the Neutral Nations Commission are binding on both parties, the Chinese delegation has repeatedly pointed out that if both belligerent parties are sincere, they will give serious consideration and importance to the recommendations of the Neutral Nations Commission that contribute to the realization of a ceasefire. The wording regarding the binding nature of the recommendations of the Neutral Nations Commission does not provide any additional guarantees in substance, but may create interference in the internal affairs of sovereign states. Therefore, there is no need to emphasize the binding nature of the commission's recommendations in the provisions regarding the scope of authority of the Neutral Nations Commission.

Regarding the voting procedure of the Neutral Nations Commission, the Chinese delegation believes that the proposal put forward by the Soviet delegation on June 14th can solve practical problems. The French delegation also stated in its speech on June 25th that there should be a distinction between general issues and the most important issues, and indicated that it is conceivable that the Neutral Nations Commission would adopt different approaches to these two types of issues. Therefore, this issue should be discussed further on the basis of the Soviet delegation's proposal of June 14th.

Regarding the composition of the Neutral Nations Commission, the Chinese delegation pointed out that the fact that some delegations still mention the idea of the United Nations undertaking the task of supervising the ceasefire at this stage can only be seen as deliberately obstructing the progress of the conference. Some delegations still advocate that the Neutral Nations Commission be composed of the Colombo Conference countries, while the two suggestions put forward by the Soviet delegation on June 16th for the conference to choose from already included the Colombo Conference countries as members of the Neutral Nations Commission. As long as the delegations of all countries show the same attitude of promoting agreement, there is no reason why the conference cannot quickly reach an agreement on this issue.

Regarding the ceasefire supervision issue in Laos and Cambodia, the Chinese delegation believes that the ceasefire supervision issue in Laos and Cambodia should and can be resolved simultaneously with the entire ceasefire supervision issue. Since everyone agrees that the neutral countries conducting international supervision in the three countries of Indochina should be the same neutral countries, it is natural and appropriate to establish a unified Neutral Nations Commission throughout Indochina. At the same time, due to the different specific situations in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, the specific circumstances of each country should be taken into account when implementing supervision. The Chinese delegation believes that the conference should continue to study in this direction based on the existing common ground, in order to formulate a plan that can achieve agreement.

The Chinese delegation finally mentioned the suggestion put forward by the Soviet delegation on June 25th to hold a more restrictive meeting of the heads of each delegation, and pointed out that some progress in recent meetings has further proved that it meets the current tasks of the conference to discuss outstanding issues by the heads of each delegation. If the conference follows such a procedure, based on the Soviet delegation's suggestion, and negotiates the suggestions of each delegation in a spirit of reconciliation, the discussion of the ceasefire supervision issue can be further advanced. Regarding the US delegation's repeated distortions of the experience of neutral nations supervising the Korean ceasefire at the conference, the Chinese delegation pointed out that this non-constructive attitude is not helpful to the work of the conference.

It is understood that the French, Lao, and Cambodian delegations also spoke at the meeting on the 6th. The French delegation referred to the Chinese delegation's speech as a "useful contribution" in its speech, while the Lao and Cambodian delegations each expressed their opinions on the ceasefire supervision issue in their respective countries.

### 印度支那问题限制性会议六日举行会议  我代表团支持苏越关于停战监察问题发言

    印度支那问题限制性会议六日举行会议
    我代表团支持苏越关于停战监察问题发言
    【新华社日内瓦六日电】日内瓦会议讨论恢复印度支那和平问题的限制性会议六日发表公报如下：
    “九国代表团在七月六日的限制性会议中继续讨论恢复印度支那和平问题。下次限制性会议将在七月九日举行。”
    【新华社日内瓦六日电】本社记者报道：根据此间得到的消息，中国代表团在六日举行的限制性会议上发了言。据悉，中国代表团在发言中表示支持苏联和越南民主共和国代表团在前两次会议上的发言，并指出法国代表团有几次关于停战监察问题的发言也应该引起会议的注意；中国代表团并认为，只要会议继续本着和解的精神进行协商，在停战监察问题上的分歧是完全可以逐步消除的。
    关于联合委员会和中立国监察委员会的关系问题，中国代表团指出，苏联、中国和越南民主共和国代表团一向认为两个委员会之间应为平行而非隶属的关系，法国代表团也曾表示并无必要使联合委员会隶属于中立国委员会。既然会议对于这一问题的意见已有了如此的接近，会议已有条件根据两委员会平行工作的原则，确定两委员会的职权范围。因此，中国代表团认为：会议以苏联代表团六月十四日建议和法国代表团六月二十五日建议为基础，对两个委员会的职权范围制订出能够获致协议的决议草案，是完全可能的。
    关于中立国委员会向双方的建议是否具有强制性的问题，中国代表团已经多次指出，如果交战双方都有诚意，他们对于中立国委员会有助于实现停战的建议就不会不予以认真的考虑和重视；关于中立国委员会建议具有强制性的措辞，实质上并不提供任何额外的保证，却可能造成对于主权国家内政的干涉。因此，在关于中立国委员会职权范围的规定中，是没有必要强调指出委员会建议的强制性的。
    关于中立国委员会的表决程序问题，中国代表团认为，苏联代表团在六月十四日提出的建议是能够解决实际问题的，法国代表团在六月二十五日的发言中也表示了一般问题和最重要的问题应该有所划分，并表示可以设想中立国委员会将对这两类问题采取不同的处理办法。因此，关于这一问题，应以苏联代表团六月十四日建议为基础继续商谈。
    关于中立国委员会的成员问题，中国代表团指出，有些代表团在目前阶段仍然提到以联合国担任监察停战任务的主张，那只能被认为是蓄意阻挠会议的进展；有些代表团仍然主张由科伦坡会议国家组成中立国委员会，而苏联代表团在六月十六日提出的供会议选择的两种建议，即已包括了科伦坡会议国家作为组成中立国委员会的成员。只要各国代表团表现出同样的促成协议的态度，会议就没有任何理由不能对这一问题迅速达成协议。
    关于老挝和柬埔寨的停战监察问题，中国代表团认为，老挝和柬埔寨的停战监察问题是应该而且可能和整个停战监察问题同时获得解决的。既然大家同意在印度支那三国进行国际监察的中立国家应是相同的中立国家，在印度支那全境成立统一的中立国委员会自然是合理的和适当的；同时，由于越南、老挝和柬埔寨的具体情况有所不同，在具体实施监察时应该照顾到各该国的特殊情况。中国代表团认为会议应根据已有的共同点在这方面继续研究，以制订出能够获致协议的方案。
    中国代表团最后提到苏联代表团在六月二十五日提出的由各代表团团长举行限制性更大的会议的建议，并指出，最近几次会议的一些进展更加证明了由各代表团团长商谈有待解决的问题，是符合会议当前任务的需要的。如果会议遵循这样的程序，以苏联代表团这一建议为基础，对各代表团建议本着和解的精神进行商谈，停战监察问题的讨论是可以向前更加推进一步的。对于美国代表团在会议上一再歪曲中立国监察朝鲜停战的经验，中国代表团指出，这种非建设性的态度对会议的工作是没有帮助的。
    据悉，法国、老挝和柬埔寨代表团也在六日会议上发了言。法国代表团在他的发言中把中国代表团的发言称为“有用的贡献”，老挝和柬埔寨代表团则各就它们本国的停战监察问题发表了意见。
