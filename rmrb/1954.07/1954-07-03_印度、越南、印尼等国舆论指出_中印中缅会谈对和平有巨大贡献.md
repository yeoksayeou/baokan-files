    Indian, Vietnamese, Indonesian and Other Countries’ Public Opinion Point Out That the Sino-Indian and Sino-Burmese Talks Have Made Great Contributions to Peace
    India
    Indian newspapers continued to comment on the Sino-Indian joint statement on June 30. All newspapers warmly welcomed the five principles in the Sino-Indian joint statement and strongly opposed the U.S. conspiracy to piece together the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.
   “The Hindustan Times” published an editorial saying that the Sino-Indian joint statement and the joint communique of Eisenhower and Churchill provide everyone with an opportunity to judge the attitude of the two talks towards major world issues, especially the Indochina war. The editorial said: "The New Delhi statement repeatedly emphasizes the need to achieve and maintain peace throughout the world (including Indochina), and also emphasizes the principles stipulated in the Sino-Indian agreement on trade and transportation between China's Tibet region and India, and believes that these principles are the best way to achieve peace."
    Regarding the Washington talks, the editorial said: "In Washington, the main concern is not to achieve peace in the Far East, but to eliminate the differences between Britain and the United States that have recently strained Anglo-American relations too much." Commenting on the Washington talks communique, the editorial said, "On the issue of Indochina, the communique stated, after talking about the situations that would arise due to reaching or failing to reach an agreement: 'We will strive to promote collective defense plans to deal with either situation'." The editorial then said: What's worse is that "the joint communique said that both sides (Britain and the United States) believe that if the French government encounters some demands that hinder reaching an acceptable agreement on the Indochina issue, 'the international situation will deteriorate seriously'." The editorial said: This is encouraging France not to "compromise", "This is a conspiracy to undermine the opportunity for any agreement to be reached in Geneva."
    The editorial then pointed out: If all countries can sincerely abide by the principles of the Sino-Indian agreement on trade and transportation between China's Tibet region and India, then it will be more effective in eliminating international tensions and restoring world peace than all complex and meticulously formulated systems of "conventions" and "treaties." The editorial said that those systems of "conventions" and "treaties" only increase the world's sense of insecurity.
    “National Herald”’s editorial believes that the meeting between the Prime Ministers of China and India, which have a population of nearly one billion, is a historic event. The editorial said: The friendship between India and China can become a major factor for peace in Asia and the world, and the principles of the Sino-Indian agreement on trade and transportation between China's Tibet region and India have pointed the way for other countries. The editorial said that since China and India have shown that "peaceful coexistence" is possible, this understanding will help eliminate international tensions and promote international peace.
    The editorial then accused the Washington talks joint communique, saying, "The decision to create a replica of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in Southeast Asia shows that the policy of aggressive intervention has not been abandoned."
    "Amrita Bazar Patrika"'s editorial pointed out: "The purpose of the New Delhi talks is to promote the efforts currently being made in Geneva for a peaceful resolution. The two prime ministers believe that the principles stipulated in the Sino-Indian agreement on trade and transportation between China's Tibet region and India can be applied to the relations between Asian countries and other countries in the world."
    The editorial condemned the U.S. conspiracy to establish an aggressive Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, saying that this organization will become an organization to maintain colonialism and will be doubted by the people of this region.
    “The Hindu”’s editorial said: “The joint statement issued by the Prime Ministers of China and India in Delhi will be welcomed by people all over the world who hope to see an end to conflicts in Asia.” The editorial wrote: “We believe that the peaceful coexistence of all countries in the world is possible as long as each country does not interfere in other countries.” The formation of military alliances will increase the possibility of such interference.
    "Free Press" said: "The most important aspect of the joint statement issued by Prime Minister Nehru and Premier Zhou Enlai is the possibility of establishing friendly relations between countries with different social and political systems. The joint statement said that if these five principles are accepted, 'these differences should not become an obstacle to peace or cause conflict'."
    "Liberty News"'s editorial said that the Sino-Indian Prime Ministers' joint statement cast a new ray of hope in the hearts of people all over the world. The joint statement has also increased the confidence of peace-loving people all over the world.
    Vietnam
    The "People's Daily," the organ of the Vietnamese Labor Party, published an editorial pointing out that the meeting between Zhou Enlai, Premier of the People's Republic of China, and Nehru, Prime Minister of India, has had a great impact on guaranteeing peace in Asia and the world. "People's Daily" said: The friendship between the Chinese and Indian people constitutes an important factor in consolidating peace forces in Asia and the world. The unity of the Chinese and Indian people, totaling 960 million, can strengthen peace.
    "People's Daily" then said that in the face of the U.S. imperialists' conspiracy to expand the war, the people of Asia have realized that they must unite closely and cooperate with each other. To this end, although some Asian countries have established different political systems, they are willing to cooperate with each other to ensure the common security of Asia and ease tensions in Asia and the world. The Sino-Indian Agreement on Trade and Transportation between China's Tibet region and India signed in April this year and the recent meeting between the Prime Ministers of China and India have laid the foundation for the long-term cooperation between these two major countries and given new impetus to the people of Asian countries.
    "People's Daily" then said that Indochina is located between China and India. The U.S. imperialists and their servants have been trying to turn this peninsula into a springboard to expand the war of aggression. "People's Daily" pointed out that the Chinese and Indian people have clearly seen this. The Chinese people have always supported the struggle of the Indochinese people for genuine peace and national independence. At the Geneva Conference, Premier Zhou Enlai actively supported the position of the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and put forward reasonable and practical proposals for restoring peace in Indochina.
    The Indian people also support the goal of the war of resistance of the three Indochinese countries. Prime Minister Nehru has repeatedly stated his support for the patriotic struggle of the Vietnamese people. It is worth noting that he prohibited aircraft carrying French reinforcements to Indochina from flying over India.
      "People's Daily" continued: While negotiations on the restoration of peace in Indochina are being held in Geneva, the meeting between Premier Zhou Enlai and Prime Minister Nehru gave strong support to the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam at the Geneva Conference. At a time when the U.S. warmongers in Washington are enticing Britain to join the Southeast Asian aggressive bloc and putting pressure on the Mendes-France government, trying to undermine the Geneva Conference and expand the Indochina war, the joint statement of the Chinese and Indian Prime Ministers gave the American and French warmongers a serious blow.
    "People's Daily" finally said: The Vietnamese people are delighted with the recent achievements in consolidating Sino-Indian friendship, and they hope that this friendship will be strengthened day by day. The close unity of the Asian people constitutes a force that will crush all aggressive conspiracies and tricks of imperialism that want to undermine peace.
    Indonesia
    Jakarta newspapers published news of the meeting between the Chinese and Burmese Prime Ministers and their joint statement in important positions on the 1st. "Abadi," "Sumber," and "Indonesian News" pointed out in the headlines: "Sino-Burmese relations are based on the five guiding principles in the Sino-Indian Agreement." "Merdeka,"
  "Indonesian Torch," and "People's Daily" also pointed out in the headlines the efforts made by the Chinese and Burmese Prime Ministers for peace in Southeast Asia.
    Many newspapers in Indonesia have also widely commented on the talks held separately by Premier Zhou Enlai and the Prime Ministers of India and Burma. "Indonesian News" published an editorial on the 1st saying: "The result of the talks between Zhou Enlai and Nehru is a great achievement for peace since World War II." The editorial said that the talks between the Prime Ministers of China and India and the talks between Churchill and Eisenhower were conducted almost simultaneously, "but they are completely different in spirit and purpose. The result of the talks between Zhou Enlai and Nehru is a huge contribution to peace. This meeting shows how to solve international problems by peaceful means."
    The editorial then said, "There is no doubt that the agreements reached in Delhi and Yangon are not only a victory for peace and friendship between India, Burma and the People's Republic of China, but also a victory for peace and friendship throughout Asia, especially Southeast Asia." The newspaper said: The "several principles" in the joint statements of the Chinese, Indian and Burmese Prime Ministers "are not only related to the interests of India and Burma, but have become principles related to the interests of other Asian countries such as Ceylon and Indonesia."
    The editorial pointed out that the Sino-Indian and Sino-Burmese Prime Ministers' talks "are of great interest to Indonesia, because we believe that the spirit of these two talks is in line with the principles of our country's independent and active foreign policy aimed at ensuring world peace."
    The newspaper finally emphasized the importance of establishing friendly relations between Asian countries, and the significance of establishing solid friendly relations with a major Asian country like the People's Republic of China. It said, "Considering signing a friendship agreement with China, the largest country in Asia, has become a priority for Indonesia's interests."
    "Sin Po," in its editorial commenting on the talks between Premier Zhou Enlai and the Prime Ministers of India and Burma, called for consolidating the unity of the people of Asian countries and increasing vigilance. The editorial pointed out that it is very necessary to increase vigilance because colonial countries are carrying out sabotage activities in Southeast Asia.
    "Great Indonesia Daily"'s editorial on June 30 said that Zhou Enlai's visit to New Delhi and Yangon was a major event in Asia. The important significance of this visit will be proved in the near future.

### 印度、越南、印尼等国舆论指出  中印中缅会谈对和平有巨大贡献

专栏：

    印度、越南、印尼等国舆论指出
    中印中缅会谈对和平有巨大贡献
    印度
    印度各报六月三十日继续评论中印两国总理联合声明，各报热烈欢迎中印两国总理联合声明中的五项原则，强烈反对美国拼凑东南亚公约组织的阴谋活动。
   “印度斯坦时报”发表社论说：中印两国总理联合声明和艾森豪威尔、邱吉尔的联合公报，使每一个人都有机会来判断这两个会谈对于当前世界重大问题，特别是印度支那战争问题所持的态度。社论说：“新德里的声明一再强调的是需要实现和维护全世界（包括印度支那在内）的和平，声明也强调了中印两国关于中国西藏地方和印度之间的通商和交通协定中规定的原则，并认为这些原则是达成和平的最好方法。”
    社论在讲到华盛顿会谈时说：“在华盛顿，主要关心的不是在远东达成和平，而是要消除近来一直使得英美关系过分紧张的英美之间的分歧。”社论评华盛顿会谈的公报说，“在印度支那问题上，公报在谈到他们考虑了由于达成协议或不能够达成协议而会产生的局面之后说：‘我们将努力推行集体防御计划以对付两种情况中的任何一种情况’。”社论接着说：更糟糕的是，“联合公报说，双方（英国和美国）都相信，如果法国政府遇到一些妨碍在印度支那问题上达成可接受的协议的要求的话，‘国际形势就会严重恶化’”。社论说：这是鼓励法国不要“妥协”，“这是一种打算破坏日内瓦可能有的达成协议的机会的阴谋。”
    社论接着指出：假如所有的国家都能诚意地遵守中印两国关于中国西藏地方和印度之间的通商和交通协定的原则，那么在消除国际紧张局势和恢复世界和平方面，要比一切复杂而周密地拟定的各种“公约”和“条约”的体系更要有效得多。社论说，那些“公约”和“条约”的体系只有增加全世界的不安全感。
    “国民先驱报”的社论认为，拥有近十亿人口的中印两国的总理的会晤是历史性的事件。社论说：印度和中国之间的友谊可以成为亚洲和世界和平的重大因素，而中印两国关于中国西藏地方和印度之间的通商和交通协定的原则已为其他国家指出了道路。社论说，由于中印两国表明了“和平共处”是可能的，这种谅解就会有助于消除国际紧张局势，并促进国际和平。
    社论接着指责华盛顿会谈的联合公报说，“在东南亚搞北大西洋公约组织翻版的决定，说明侵略性的干涉政策并没有放弃。”
    “甘露市场报”的社论指出：“新德里的会谈目的在于促进目前在日内瓦为和平解决而作的努力。两位总理认为中印两国关于中国西藏地方和印度之间的通商和交通协定中所规定的原则可以适用于亚洲以及世界其他国家的关系之中。”
    社论谴责美国阴谋建立侵略性的东南亚公约组织说，这个组织将成为维护殖民主义的组织，将受到这个地区的人民的怀疑。
    “印度教徒报”的社论说：“中印两国总理在德里发表的联合声明将受到全世界希望看到结束亚洲冲突的人们的欢迎。”社论写道：“我们认为，只要每一个国家不干涉其他国家，世界各国的和平共处是可能的。军事联盟的组成将增加这种干涉的可能性。”
    “自由新闻”说：“尼赫鲁总理与周恩来总理所发表的联合声明的最重要的方面，是关于不同的社会和政治制度的国家之间建立友好关系的可能性。联合声明说，如果接受这五项原则，‘这些差别就不应成为和平的障碍或造成冲突’。”
    “自由报”的社论说，中印两国总理联合声明给世界人民心中投射了新的希望的光芒。联合声明也增加了全世界爱好和平人民的信心。
    越南
    越南劳动党机关报“人民报”发表社论指出，中华人民共和国总理周恩来和印度总理尼赫鲁的会见对保障亚洲和世界和平发生了巨大的影响。“人民报”说：中印两国人民之间的友谊构成了巩固亚洲以及世界和平力量的重要因素。中印两国总计九亿六千万人民的团结一致，是可以加强和平的。
    “人民报”接着说，面对着美帝国主义者扩大战争的阴谋，亚洲人民已经认识到必须紧密地团结起来并互相合作。为此，亚洲一些国家虽然建立了不同的政治制度，但它们愿意互相合作来保障亚洲的共同安全，缓和亚洲和世界的紧张局势。中国和印度今年四月签订的关于中国西藏地方和印度之间的通商和交通协定以及中印两国总理最近的会见为这两个大国的持久合作奠定了基础，并给予亚洲国家人民新的动力。
    “人民报”接着说，印度支那位居中国和印度之间。美帝国主义者和他们的仆从一直在企图把这个半岛变成一个跳板来扩大侵略战争。“人民报”指出，中国和印度人民已经清楚地看到了这一点。中国人民一直是支持印度支那人民争取真正和平和民族独立的斗争的。在日内瓦会议上，周恩来总理积极支持越南民主共和国代表团的立场，并且为了恢复印度支那和平，提出了合理的、实际可行的建议。
    印度人民也支持印度支那三国人民抗战的目标。尼赫鲁总理曾多次表示他支持越南人民的爱国斗争。值得注意的是，他禁止载运法国派往印度支那的援兵的飞机飞越印度。
      “人民报”继续说：在关于恢复印度支那和平的谈判在日内瓦进行的时候，周恩来总理和尼赫鲁总理的会见给予了日内瓦会议上的越南民主共和国代表团有力的支持。在华盛顿的美国战争贩子正诱使英国加入东南亚侵略集团，并对孟戴斯—弗朗斯政府施加压力，想破坏日内瓦会议并扩大印度支那战争的时候，中印两国总理的联合声明给予了美国和法国战争贩子严重的打击。
    “人民报”最后说：对于巩固中印友谊方面最近取得的成就，越南人民感到欢欣鼓舞，他们希望这种友谊一天比一天加强。亚洲人民紧密地团结起来，就构成了一股力量，这种力量将粉碎帝国主义想破坏和平的一切侵略阴谋和诡计。
    印度尼西亚
    雅加达各报一日以重要地位刊登了中缅两国总理会谈的新闻和他们的联合声明。“永恒报”、“泉源报”和“印尼新闻”在标题中指出：“中缅关系基于中印协定中的五项指导原则”。“独立报”、
  “印尼火炬报”和“人民日报”也都在标题中指出中缅两国总理为东南亚的和平所作的努力。
    印度尼西亚的很多报纸还广泛地评论了周恩来总理和印、缅两国总理分别举行的会谈。“印尼新闻”在一日发表社论说：“周恩来和尼赫鲁会谈的结果，是二次世界大战以来和平的伟大成就。”社论说，中印两国总理的会谈和邱吉尔与艾森豪威尔的会谈差不多是同时进行的，“但它们在精神上和目的上却截然不同。周恩来和尼赫鲁的会谈的结果是对和平的巨大贡献。这个会谈说明怎样用和平方法来解决国际问题。”
    社论接着说，“毫无疑问，在德里和仰光达成的协议不仅是印度、缅甸和中华人民共和国和平与友好的胜利，而且也是整个亚洲、特别是东南亚的和平与友好的胜利。”报纸说：中印和中缅总理联合声明中的“几项原则不仅是和印度、缅甸的利益有关，而且已成为和其他亚洲国家像锡兰、印度尼西亚的利益有关的原则”。
    社论指出，中印和中缅总理会谈“使印度尼西亚很感兴趣，因为我们认为，这两个会谈的精神符合于我国目的在于确保世界和平的独立和积极的外交政策的原则”。
    报纸最后着重指出亚洲各国之间建立友好关系的重要性，以及和像中华人民共和国这样一个亚洲大国建立巩固的友好关系的意义。它说，“考虑和亚洲最大的国家中华人民共和国签订友好协定，已经成为对印尼利益的首要事情。”
    “新报”在评论周恩来总理和印、缅总理会谈的社论中，要求巩固亚洲各国人民的团结和提高警惕性。社论指出，由于殖民国家在东南亚进行破坏活动，提高警惕性是非常必要的。
    “大印尼报”六月三十日的社论说，周恩来访问新德里与仰光，是亚洲的重大事件。这种访问的重要意义，在最近将来就可以得到证明。
