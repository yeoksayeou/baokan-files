After the publicity of the General Line last winter, the mutual aid and cooperation movement in Shanqiandian Township, Laiyang County, Shandong Province, achieved new development, and women also joined mutual aid and cooperation organizations with their families. However, most women did not have the habit of working in the fields, and their concept of labor and collective consciousness were very weak. Some cadres and male members of societies and groups were resistant to women's participation in field production. Therefore, production was still "men helping each other, women working individually."

Some committee members of the societies and most leaders of mutual aid groups lacked a correct understanding of the role of mobilizing women to participate in field production. They were afraid that women would earn work points, reducing the income of male members of societies (groups). In particular, committee members of societies and leaders of mutual aid groups who had no female labor in their own families did everything possible to prevent women from working in the societies (groups). The head of the Hou Dian Village Agricultural Production Cooperative openly said to the members: "It doesn't matter if a few more people or a few less people do farm work. There's no need to mobilize women, it's too much trouble; anyway, our society's land can be planted."

Most male members of societies and groups looked down on women, saying that women "work slowly and the quality is low, either they strain their backs or get cramps." The deputy secretary of the Ya Hou Village branch said: "What we men can do in a morning is enough for women to busy themselves for a day. Women are good at grinding, milling, and cooking, but they are not good at working in the fields." When women in the Nan Village society asked to participate in labor, the male members deliberately made things difficult for them with tasks that were beyond their capabilities, wanting them to "retreat in the face of difficulty." They deliberately asked the women to carry bean bags weighing two hundred catties; when the women couldn't lift them, they sarcastically said: "We didn't let you do it, you clamored to do it; when we really let you do it, you can't do it. If women could do the work, what would we need men for!"

There were two attitudes among the women. A small number of women who had the habit of working in the fields and whose families lacked male labor actively requested to participate in field labor and expressed dissatisfaction with the refusal of women to work in the societies (groups). They worried that the land would enter the society but the people could not enter the society to earn points, resulting in less income after the autumn harvest and a difficult winter. They said: They only hung up the guise of a cooperative member, but could not get into the society to work, which was not as good as working individually. Some gritted their teeth and went to work in the society, saying: "Even if it makes people dislike us, it's better than starving in winter; just keep working, and we'll get some points anyway." But most women had a serious sense of inferiority. Some middle-aged women said: "We look for men for clothing and food. If women can do mountain work, who would look for a man?" Some said: "Men plow and women weave from ancient times to the present, and farming is not something women do." Some young women said: "Women will eventually belong to someone else's family. As unmarried daughters at home, they should be relaxed."

The Shanqiandian Township Party organization paid attention to this situation, and starting from the needs of developing production, consolidating mutual aid and cooperative organizations, and liberating women, combined with spring plowing and production, carried out the work of mobilizing and organizing women.

First, by checking and revising the society's (group's) production increase plan, checking production increase measures, and arranging labor, the committee members of the societies and the leaders of mutual aid groups realized that mobilizing women to participate in agricultural production was one of the important keys to ensuring the realization of the production increase plan, and realized that only by mobilizing men and women together can they "tighten the eight-strand rope together" and jointly build socialism. For example, the Ya Hou Village Agricultural Production Cooperative has a total of 371 mu of land, with an original output of 100,000 catties per year, and this year's planned output is to reach 170,000 catties. The measures to increase production are: planting more high-yield crops, selecting and replacing good varieties, plowing more land, applying more fertilizer, improving cultivation techniques, and turning dry land into paddy fields. Preliminary calculations show that to do these things well, each mu of land requires 14 workdays; the whole society has a total of 21 male laborers, averaging more than 247 workdays per person per year. However, to avoid missing the agricultural season, each person cannot exceed 220 workdays per year at most; if some members are sick or have other things to do, the work done will be even less. After calculating this, the committee members realized that without mobilizing women, the production increase plan could not be realized. At the same time, the Party organization also educated everyone on the political significance of mobilizing women to participate in production. After many committee members of societies and leaders of mutual aid groups recognized the political significance and economic role of women's participation in field labor, they criticized their conservative ideas and expressed that they would take the lead in mobilizing their wives, sisters to participate in labor, and welcome women who are willing to engage in field labor.

After the leading cadres clarified their thinking, they went separately to educate the members of the societies and groups, telling everyone the amount of labor needed to ensure increased production. This made the male members of the societies (groups) understand that women's participation in labor was not about taking advantage of men, but about producing more grain and industrial raw materials in the fields, which was beneficial to the country and themselves. Many people reviewed their past mistakes of hating, attacking, and looking down on women, and expressed that they would unite men and women and work hard together. The Ya Hou Society also carried out appropriate division of labor according to the women's physical strength and skills, and stipulated the calculation method of labor remuneration according to the principle of equal pay for equal work.

At the same time, the Party organization also educated women, broke their sense of inferiority, and mobilized them to strive for the construction of socialism and for their own complete liberation. They were told that labor is glorious, only labor can create wealth, only socialism can make the working people rich together, and participating in production and participating in mutual aid and cooperation is the path to the complete liberation of rural women; women must ensure the realization of the production increase plan of their societies and groups and their own families, increase the production of more grain and industrial raw materials, support national construction, improve their own lives, work for the construction of socialism, and also work to improve their own material lives. They also praised the model figures among the local women and called on the women of the whole township to learn from them.

After such layer-by-layer mobilization and education, the women in the township's mutual aid groups and cooperatives who could participate in agricultural labor were all invested in spring plowing and production, and were generally more active.

The main experiences of Shanqiandian Township in mobilizing women to participate in production are:

(1) It is necessary to educate both male and female members of societies, starting from the relationship between national industrialization, the socialist transformation of agriculture, and the complete liberation of women, and from the necessity of women's participation in production for increasing production. First of all, the leading cadres of the branch and the societies and groups must clarify their thinking, and then implement it among the broad masses of peasants. Because rural women are burdened by housework and children, have had fewer opportunities for education in the past, and have a serious sense of inferiority and the idea of "relying on men for food," in addition to mobilizing both men and women together, more education must be carried out for women.

(2) According to the actual needs of production and the ability of each woman, women should be appropriately organized into all aspects of agricultural production, and it is necessary to avoid rigidly mobilizing them without considering the objects, regardless of the conditions, and in a uniform manner. Shanqiandian Township paid attention to this point, and organized young and middle-aged women who lacked labor at home, had labor training, were not burdened by housework, and had few children to field labor according to needs and voluntary principles, and then divided the work according to each person's ability, with some plowing, seeding, and digging; and some doing weeding, sending manure, and eliminating pests. Middle-aged and elderly women with many children and heavy housework were organized in agricultural auxiliary labor. Doing soaking seeds, selecting seeds, accumulating fertilizer, raising livestock, etc.; at the same time, they were mobilized to do a good job in family hygiene, ensure the prosperity of both people and livestock, and cook meals in a timely manner without delaying production, which also played a role in increasing agricultural production. Because the use of women's labor was appropriate, women were relatively satisfied with various jobs, and production results were also better.

(3) After women are mobilized, attention should also be paid to solving several specific problems in order to maintain their enthusiasm. First, with the continuous improvement of mutual aid and cooperative organizations, gradually achieve remuneration according to labor and equal pay for equal work. Four cooperatives have implemented small-scale contract work and piecework payment, and some mutual aid groups have implemented fixed scores and flexible evaluation, which have consolidated women's labor enthusiasm to varying degrees. Second, respect women's democratic rights. After women participated in production, in some societies and most groups in this township, men were still the full representatives of each household, and even the major production plans in the societies and groups (such as formulating plans, determining scoring standards, etc.) were not passed by the women. They just listened to orders, and when others made decisions, they followed. Over time, it is inevitable that women's labor enthusiasm will be difficult to maintain. Therefore, cooperatives and mutual aid groups should appropriately absorb women to participate in leadership and respect the democratic rights of women members and group members, absorb women to participate in meetings, and gradually improve women's awareness and ability, so as to better play the role of women. Third, help women learn technology. Some members of societies and groups only dislike women for being clumsy and inefficient because they do not understand production technology, but they do not teach them technology. After some women are ridiculed and criticized, they blush once and grit their teeth, endure and endure, and cry three or four times, and are even forced to quit. The Zhu Chengming mutual aid group in Hou Dian Village launched a mutual teaching and learning movement of husband teaching wife, father teaching daughter, and brother teaching sister; after the women learned the technology, they completed the production tasks in a timely manner, strengthened unity within the group, and the women also showed high morale and full confidence. Fourth, appropriately take care of the difficulties of women in production, and the leaders should take the initiative to take care of the special circumstances of women during menstruation and pregnancy, appropriately assign light work, and protect women's health.

    要完成增产计划就必须发动妇女参加生产
    ——莱阳山前店乡发动妇女参加农业生产的经验
    山东省莱阳专区民主妇女联合会
    去年冬季宣传总路线以后，山东省莱阳县山前店乡的互助合作运动有了新的发展，妇女群众也随着家庭参加了互助合作组织。但是多数妇女没有田间劳动的习惯，劳动观念和集体观念很薄弱；有些社和组的骨干和男社员、组员对于妇女参加田间生产也有抵触情绪，因此，生产起来仍是“男互助、女单干”。
    部分社的社务委员和多数互助组长，对发动妇女参加田间生产的作用缺乏正确的认识。他们怕妇女挣工分去，减少了男社（组）员的收入。特别是自己家中无女劳力的社务委员和互助组长，更百般阻挡，不许妇女进社（组）干活。后店村农业生产合作社的社长公开向社员讲：“庄稼活多几个人能干，少几个人也没多大关系，不必发动妇女，麻麻烦烦；反正咱社的地也能种上。”
    多数男社员、组员却轻视妇女，说妇女“干活慢、质量低，不是闪腰，就是岔气”。崖后村支部副书记说：“咱男人干一个早上，够妇女忙一天的。妇女推磨、轧碾、作饭是内行，干山上的营生可不行。”南村社的妇女要求参加劳动，男社员故意以她们力所难及的营生来难为她们，想使她们“畏难而退”。他们故意叫妇女抬二百斤重的豆子包；妇女抬不起来，他们就讽刺说：“不让你们干，你们张罗着要干；真叫你们干，又干不了。要是女人能干活，还要男人干什么！”
    妇女中有两种情绪。少数有田野劳动习惯而且家里缺乏男劳力的妇女，积极要求参加田间劳动，对社（组）内拒绝妇女干活表示不满。她们顾虑土地入社而人不能进社挣分，秋后收入少，冬天难过。她们说：只挂了个合作社员的幌子，捞不着进社干活，反不如单干好。也有的硬着头皮进社干活，说：
  “即便惹人不喜见，也比冬天饿肚皮强；只管干下去，反正多少得给几分。”但多数妇女有严重的自卑心理。有些中年妇女说：找男人就为穿衣吃饭，女人能干山上活，谁还找男人？有的说：男耕女织自古至今，庄稼营生本不是妇女干的。有的青年妇女说：妇女迟早终是别人门里的人，在家为闺女应该松闲松闲。
    山前店乡党组织注意了这个情况，从发展生产、巩固互助合作组织和解放妇女三方面的需要出发，结合春耕生产，进行了发动和组织妇女的工作。
    首先，通过检查和修正社（组）的增产计划，检查增产措施，进行劳力排队，使社务委员和互助组长认识到发动妇女参加农业生产是保证增产计划实现的重要关键之一，认识到只有男女一齐发动起来，才能“八股绳一齐紧”，共同建设社会主义。例如崖后村农业生产合作社，共有土地三百七十一亩，原产量是每年十万斤，今年计划产量要达到十七万斤。增产措施是：多种高产作物，选换优良品种，多刨地，多施肥，改良耕作技术，变旱田为水田。初步计算一下，要做好这些事情，每亩地需要十四个工；全社共有二十一个男劳力，平均每人一年要努力工作二百四十七个多工作日，但是，要不误农事季节，每人全年最多不能超过二百二十个工作日；假如社员中有个别生病或有其他事情发生时，做的工就更少了。算了这笔账，社务委员们认识到：不发动妇女，增产计划就不可能实现。同时党组织又从发动妇女参加生产的政治意义上对大家进行了教育。许多社务委员和互助组长认识了妇女参加田间劳动的政治意义和经济作用以后，都批判了自己的保守思想，并表示要带头动员自己的妻子姊妹参加劳动，对愿意从事田间劳动的妇女表示欢迎。
    领导骨干思想明确以后，便分头向社员、组员进行教育，把为了保证增产所需用的劳动数量算给大家听。这笔账使男社（组）员明白了妇女参加劳动并不是揩男人的油，而是使地里生产出更多的粮食和工业原料，对国家对自己都有利。许多人检讨了过去仇视、打击和看不起妇女的错误思想，表示要男女团结，一齐努力生产。崖后社并根据妇女的体力和技术，进行了适当的分工，按照同劳同酬的原则规定了劳动报酬的计算办法。
    同时，党组织也向妇女进行教育，打破她们的自卑心理，发动她们为建设社会主义、为自身的彻底解放而努力。向她们说明：劳动是光荣的，只有劳动才能创造财富，只有社会主义才能使劳动人民一同富裕，参加生产、参加互助合作是农村妇女彻底解放的道路；妇女要保证所在社、组和自己家庭的增产计划的实现，增产更多粮食和工业原料，支援国家建设，改善自己的生活，为建设社会主义而劳动，也为改善自己的物质生活而劳动。并表扬当地妇女中的模范人物，号召全乡妇女向她们看齐。
    经过这样层层发动和教育，全乡互助组和合作社中能参加农业劳动的妇女都投入了春耕生产，一般都比较积极。
    山前店乡发动妇女参加生产的主要经验是：
      （一）必须从国家工业化、农业社会主义改造和妇女彻底解放的关系着眼，从妇女参加生产对于增加生产的必要性着眼，对男女社员一同进行教育。首先要使支部和社、组的领导骨干思想明确，然后在广大农民中贯彻。由于农村妇女有家务和孩子的牵累，过去受教育的机会较少，自卑心理和“靠男人吃饭”的思想严重，因而除去男女一齐发动外，还必须对妇女进行更多的教育。
      （二）要根据生产的实际需要，根据各个妇女的力所能及，适当地把妇女组织到农业生产的各个方面去，切忌不顾对象、不分条件、千篇一律地硬性动员。山前店乡注意到了这一点，把那些家中缺乏劳力、有劳动锻炼、家务不重、孩子不多的青年中年妇女，根据需要和自愿，组织到田间劳动中去，再根据各个人能力进行分工，一部分扶犁耕地、耧地、刨地；一部分做锄草、送粪、除虫害等活。把那些孩子多、家务累的中年妇女和老年妇女组织在农业辅助劳动方面。作浸种、选种、积肥、饲畜等活；同时动员她们搞好家庭卫生，保证人畜两旺，作饭及时不误生产等，对农业增产也起了作用。由于对妇女劳力使用得当，妇女在各种工作中都比较满意，生产成绩也比较好。
    （三）妇女发动起来以后，还要注意解决几个具体问题，才能使她们的积极情绪坚持下去。一、要随着互助合作组织的不断提高逐步作到按劳取酬、同劳同酬。有四个合作社实行了小段包工、按件计工，有些互助组实行死分活评，都不同程度地巩固了妇女劳动积极性。二、要尊重妇女的民主权利。这个乡的部分社和多数组，在妇女参加生产以后，各户仍以男人为全权代表，连社、组内的生产大计（如订计划、确定计分标准等）都不通过妇女。她们只是听招呼，人家决定了，她们就跟着干。这样久了，妇女的劳动积极性必然难以维持。因此，合作社、互助组应适当地吸收妇女参加领导，并尊重妇女社员、组员的民主权利，吸收妇女参加会议，逐步提高妇女的觉悟和能力，更好地发挥妇女的作用。三、要帮助妇女学习技术。有些社员、组员因为妇女不懂生产技术，只嫌她们干活粗笨，效率低，却又不教给她们技术。有些妇女们受了讥笑和指摘后，一次红脸，硬着头皮挨，二次忍气吞声再忍耐，三次四次就哭了，甚至被逼得不干了。后店村朱成明互助组里开展了夫教妻、父教女、兄教妹的互教互学运动；妇女学会技术后，及时完成了生产任务，加强了组内团结，妇女也表现得情绪高、信心足。四、要适当照顾妇女在生产中的困难，领导方面要主动照顾妇女在经期、孕期的特殊情况，适当调给轻活，保护妇女身体健康。
