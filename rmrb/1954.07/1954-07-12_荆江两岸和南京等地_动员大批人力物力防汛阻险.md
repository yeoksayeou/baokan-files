Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, July 11th: The people on both banks of the Jingjiang River (the section of the Yangtze River from Zhijiang County, Hubei Province, to Chenglingji at the mouth of Dongting Lake in Hunan Province) are actively reinforcing the Jingjiang Dam and the dikes of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Area under the leadership of the local Communist Party committees and people's governments. Some dangerous sections of the Jingjiang Dam have been turned from danger to safety after several days of vigorous rescue and repair. A section of the dam in Huanglindang, Jiangling County, experienced landslides and other dangerous conditions, but has now been rescued by 2,000 laborers. Two places near Shashi were found to have muddy water leaks in the dam body, and both have now been saved by using methods such as pressure-infiltration platforms and cofferdams.

Since late June, the water level in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River has been rising continuously. In order to ensure the safety of the Jingjiang Dam and the dikes of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Area, the Jingzhou Local Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Shashi Committee of the Communist Party of China have mobilized a large amount of manpower and resources from various counties along the river and Shashi City to invest in flood prevention work. The Jingzhou Administrative Office, the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission, the Jingzhou Flood Control Headquarters, the Yangtze River Repair and Prevention Office, and the Changde Administrative Office of Hunan Province have jointly formed the Jingjiang Flood Diversion and Flood Control Headquarters to focus on directing the flood prevention work of the Jingjiang Dam and the flood diversion area, and have studied specific flood prevention measures in detail on the 5th of this month. The Shashi People's Government has organized all cadres, workers, citizens, laborers, and urban residents of the city to participate in flood prevention work. In recent days, workers, troops, farmers, urban residents, and engineering technicians participating in flood prevention have been rapidly concentrating on the dikes, and ships, cars, barges, flatbed carts and other land and water transportation vehicles and human transport teams are rapidly transporting large amounts of wood, stones, planks, reed mats and other materials to various construction sites. On July 8, 60,000 laborers on the Jingjiang Dam were busily reinforcing and repairing the dikes, and more than 16,000 laborers in the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Area were also reinforcing and protecting the dikes. In addition, more than 30,000 laborers from Gong'an, Songzi, Jiangling, Shishou, Jingjiang, and Anxiang counties who are supporting the dam repair are marching towards the Jingjiang Dam.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, July 11th: The people of Nanjing are actively preventing floods and mitigating risks, ensuring the normal progress of urban transportation and production.

Since the beginning of summer, there has been excessive rainfall in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, and the water levels of rivers have been rising continuously. In early July, the flood peak of Poyang Lake in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River reached Nanjing, coinciding with rising tides, and the water level of the Yangtze River approached the highest historical level. In addition, mountain floods broke out in the four suburbs of Nanjing, and the water of the Qinhuai River, which runs through the city, surged violently. In this emergency situation, the Nanjing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Nanjing Municipal People's Government mobilized all their forces to fight the flood. The Nanjing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China worked all night to directly grasp the water situation and organize forces to prevent risks and rescue people. Commanders and soldiers of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Nanjing also participated in patrolling the dikes, investigating dangers, and repairing dangerous works. When a section of the river embankment outside Zhonghua Gate began to loosen and crack, the Traffic Police Brigade and the Fire Brigade of the Municipal Public Security Bureau immediately went to repair it. Thousands upon thousands of workers, government cadres, students, urban residents, and suburban farmers also went to various dangerous construction sites in the wind and rain to protect the dikes and fill gaps. Workers at the Nanjing Flour Mill built a 150-meter-long and two-foot-high dike around the warehouse in the wind and rain, saving more than 200,000 catties of wheat for the country. Railway workers transported more than 500 cubic meters of stones, and the engineering team of the Municipal Works Bureau rushed to help from afar, building a protective project for more than 640 meters of the dike body in one day. More than 1,000 residents of the Xianyu Lane Residents' Committee in Xiaguan defended the Huimin River day and night for more than a week, blocking three dangerous works and ensuring that two household sections were not flooded. They also sent more than 140 people to Erbanqiao to support dike protection. Workers from Nanjing Electric Porcelain Factory, Nanjing Waterworks, and other units have established flood prevention command organizations, both preventing floods and producing. Now, water and land transportation in the city is as usual, factories continue to produce, and accumulated water in farmland is being actively drained.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, July 11th: Farmers in the main rice-producing areas of the Taihu Lake Basin and along the Yangtze River and the Grand Canal in Jiangsu Province have all been mobilized to prevent floods and drain waterlogging, strengthen paddy field management, and strive to reduce autumn harvest losses.

Since the beginning of summer, some rice-producing areas in Jiangsu Province have experienced internal waterlogging disasters due to excessive rainfall. Local Communist Party committees and people's government cadres have actively led farmers to carry out flood prevention and drainage to protect seedlings. More than 4,000 pumps have been dispatched throughout the province to help farmers drain water from the fields. In the Sima District of Jiangdu County, more than 15,000 mu of fields were too deeply flooded to affect rice transplanting. The Sima District Committee of the Communist Party of China mobilized all cadres to go to the countryside, organized more than 4,000 people and more than 670 waterwheels to draw water day and night, so that rice seedlings could be transplanted in the fields in time. In the Zhoushu District of Kunshan County, rice seedlings in some villages were flooded several times, and the organized farmers insisted on draining water day and night, so that 120,000 mu of flooded fields were rescued in time, and the seedlings grew well. Two agricultural production cooperatives and seventy-three mutual aid groups in Yingfang Town, Jiangning County, led the farmers of the whole township to maintain more than 8,000 mu of paddy fields from being flooded after more than 40 days of intensive drainage, and the seedlings grew to a height of one foot and five inches. At present, drainage is still being carried out vigorously in some severely flooded areas. In areas that have been rescued, some are washing the mud off the rice seedlings with water, and some are replanting or replanting late rice with a shorter growing period. In most areas of the province, farmers are braving the rain to cultivate, hoe, weed, and apply quick-acting fertilizers in the rice fields to promote growth, rejuvenate growth, and accelerate the growth of seedlings. All localities pay special attention to comprehensively inspecting the dangerous works and leaks on the dikes, repairing, reinforcing, and raising them, and sending special personnel to manage large and small culverts, and guarding the dikes of rivers, lakes, and lakes to ensure the safe growth of rice in large areas of farmland.

    荆江两岸和南京等地
    动员大批人力物力防汛阻险
    【新华社武汉十一日电】荆江（长江中游自湖北省枝江县到湖南省洞庭湖口的城陵矶一段）两岸人民正在当地中共党委和人民政府领导下积极加固荆江大堤和荆江分洪区的堤防。荆江大堤某些堤身危险的地方，经过数日来大力抢救和补修，已转危为安。江陵县黄林壋一段大堤，曾发生脱坡等险象，经两千民工抢救，现已脱险。沙市附近发现二处堤身有浑水漏洞，现在也都用做压浸台、围井等办法救住。
    六月下旬以来，长江中游水位不断上涨。为了确保荆江大堤和荆江分洪区堤防的安全，中共荆州地方委员会和中共沙市委员会已动员沿江各县和沙市的大批人力物力，投入防汛工作。荆州专署、长江水利委员会、荆州防汛指挥部、长江修防处和湖南省常德专署等单位已联合组成荆江分洪防汛指挥部，重点指挥荆江大堤和分洪区的防汛工作，并已在本月五日详细研究了防汛的具体措施。沙市人民政府已组织全市机关干部、工人、市民、民工投入防汛工作。连日来，各地参加防汛的工人、部队、农民、城市居民以及工程技术人员正在迅速地向堤防集中，轮船、汽车、驳船、板车等水陆交通运输工具和人力运输队正在迅速地把大量木柴、石块、木板、芦席等各种器材物资运向各个工地。七月八日，荆江大堤上有六万民工紧张地进行堤防的加固补修工作，荆江分洪区也已有一万六千多民工进行加固护堤工作。另外、公安、松滋、江陵、石首、荆江和安乡等县三万多个支援修堤的民工，正在向荆江大堤进发。
  【新华社南京十一日电】南京市人民积极防汛阻险，保证了城市交通和生产的正常进行。
    入夏以来，长江中下游雨水过多，江河水位不断上涨。七月初，长江中游鄱阳湖洪峰到达南京，适值海潮上涨，长江水位接近历史上最高水位。加上南京四郊山洪暴发，穿越市区的秦淮河水势猛涨。在这种紧急情况下，中共南京市委员会和南京市人民政府动员全力和洪水作斗争。中共南京市委员会通宵办公，直接掌握水情，组织力量防险抢救。人民解放军驻南京市某部指挥员和战斗员也参加巡堤、查险和抢修险工。中华门外有一段河堤开始松裂时，市公安局交通警察大队和消防大队立即前往抢修。成千成万的工人、机关干部、学生、城市居民和郊区农民，也在狂风暴雨中到各处险工地段护堤补缺。南京面粉厂的工人风雨中在仓库周围筑起了一条一百五十公尺长和两尺高的堤防，为国家保住了二十多万斤小麦。铁路工人运来五百多公方石头，市工务局工程队远道赶来协助，一天当中就给六百四十多公尺的堤身筑成了一道防护工程。下关鲜鱼巷居民委员会一千多人在惠民河畔连续一个多星期日夜防守，堵住三处险工，保住两个户口段没有进水。他们还派一百四十多人到二板桥支援保堤。南京电瓷厂、南京自来水厂等单位的工人都成立防汛指挥组织，一边防汛一边生产。现在全市水陆交通如常，工厂继续生产，农田积水正积极排除中。
    【新华社南京十一日电】江苏省太湖流域和长江、运河两岸主要水稻产区的农民已经全部动员起来防汛排涝，加强稻田管理，力争秋收不减产。
    江苏省部分水稻产区入夏以来因雨水过多，发生内涝灾害。当地中共党委和人民政府的干部积极地领导农民进行了防汛、排水保苗的斗争。全省出动了四千多部抽水机，帮助农民排除田里的积水。江都县嘶马区有一万五千多亩田积水太深影响插秧，中共嘶马区委会动员全体干部下乡，组织了四千多人和六百七十多部水车日夜车水，使地里及时插上了秧。昆山县周墅区有些乡村稻苗数次被淹，组织起来的农民日夜坚持排水，使受涝的十二万亩田及时抢救出来，苗禾生长良好。江宁县营防镇的两个农业生产合作社和七十三个互助组带动全乡农民，经过四十多天的紧张排涝，保住八千多亩稻田不受淹，秧苗生长一尺五寸高。目前某些水涝严重地区，仍在大力排涝。已经抢救出来的地区，有的放水洗去秧苗上的泥土，有的进行补棵或补种生长期较短的晚稻。全省绝大部分地区的农民正冒雨在稻田里加工耘耥、锄草、追施速效肥料，对秧苗进行催壮、复壮和加快发棵等工作。各地特别注意普遍检查堤岸险工、漏洞，进行修补、加固、加高，并派专人管理大小涵闸，和守卫江、河、湖堤，以确保大片农田的水稻安全生长。
