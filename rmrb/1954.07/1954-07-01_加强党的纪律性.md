    Strengthening Party Discipline
    The resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party pointed out that the unity of the Party is the life of the Party, a most fundamental principle of Marxism-Leninism, and a basic guarantee for the victory of the revolution. Enhancing Party unity and strengthening Party discipline are inseparable. Party discipline is a powerful weapon to ensure Party unity and the realization of the Party's policies and principles.
    The purpose of strictly enforcing Party discipline is to ensure ideological consistency and unity of action within the Party. Our Party has always advocated expanding democratic life within the Party, carrying out criticism and self-criticism, ensuring the presentation and discussion of different opinions within the Party, and advocating the elimination of differences and the achievement of ideological consensus through debates and studies on matters of principle. At the same time, our Party also has its own strict organizational principles, such as the individual Party member's subordination to the organization, the minority's subordination to the majority, the lower level's subordination to the higher level, and the entire Party's subordination to the Central Committee. The Party Constitution stipulates strict compliance with the Party's organizational principles and faithful implementation of the Party's policies, as well as adherence to the Party organization's resolutions, as the obligations of Party members and the discipline of the Party. This means that every Communist Party member has the right to freely express his or her opinions before a decision is made on an issue; but after a decision is made, both individual Party members and Party organizations must unconditionally obey the Party's organizational principles and implement the Party's policies and resolutions. This high degree of conscious discipline of Communist Party members ensures that the actions of the entire Party can be united and consistent under any circumstances.
    Lenin regarded the Party's strict discipline as one of the basic conditions for Bolshevik success. Comrade Mao Zedong also repeatedly elaborated on this principle in his many works, especially when the revolution was at a critical historical juncture. In 1941, when the War of Resistance Against Japan was at its most difficult, the Party Central Committee issued a decision on strengthening Party spirit, severely criticizing the tendency of independence within the Party, demanding unity of will, unity of action, unity of discipline, and centralized leadership within the Party, pointing out that "unified discipline is a necessary condition for the victory of the revolution." In 1948, when the Liberation War was about to achieve national victory, Comrade Mao Zedong instructed all Party cadres to study Chapter 2 of Lenin's "Left-Wing" Communism: An Infantile Disorder, saying: "Please read Chapter 2 of this book so that comrades understand that we must eliminate some serious undisciplined or anarchic states that now exist in our work." In the foreword to the reprint of Chapter 2 of this book by the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central Committee, it was further pointed out: "To maintain the victories already won and continue to win, and to achieve victory on a national scale, centralized revolutionary discipline is of paramount and decisive significance." At present, when we are at a crucial historical juncture of carrying out the socialist revolution, the Fourth Plenary Session of the Party has made a resolution to enhance Party unity. This is of great historical significance.
    At present, are the Party's discipline and the implementation of Party discipline fully in line with the spirit emphasized by the Party Central Committee, Comrade Mao Zedong's previous instructions, and the resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session? From the perspective of the entire Party, the vast majority of Party members can consciously abide by Party discipline; Party organizations at all levels are generally serious about enforcing discipline, and therefore Party discipline is basically solid. However, this does not mean that the discipline of all Party members within our Party is already very good, and that all Party organizations equally seriously and conscientiously enforce Party discipline. The fact is that within our Party, there are still some Party members with very poor discipline. And what is particularly worthy of vigilance is that some relatively senior cadres above the county level are overwhelmed by some achievements in their work, are arrogant and conceited, and disregard Party principles and discipline. They often use the excuse that their region or department has "special circumstances" and "advanced work," and that their opinions have been "consistently correct," and refuse to implement Party policies, even arrogantly claiming "If there are problems, I will take responsibility"; they do not abide by the Party's principle of democratic centralism and collective leadership, promote personal prestige, emphasize personal roles, and confront the Party; they can only listen to flattery, cannot accept criticism, and even retaliate against critics; they engage in sectarian activities within the Party, colluding and spreading rumors, provoking relations within the Party, and undermining Party unity; they implement factional cadre policies in order to achieve their personal despicable goals; they regard their regions and departments as personal capital and independent kingdoms, not subject to Party discipline, resisting Party inspection and supervision, and treating Party discipline as a tool to exclude dissidents, maintain personal reputation and status, and consolidate independent kingdoms. In these individual regions and individual departments of all sizes, Party discipline has been seriously undermined.
    On the other hand, within our Party, some people have also adopted a liberal and indulgent attitude towards this serious phenomenon of violation of discipline. Some people believe that these relatively senior cadres are now independently responsible for the leadership work of a region above the county level, or are independently responsible for the leadership work of an important department. Their struggle history is long, their level of consciousness seems to be very high, their Marxist-Leninist theory seems to understand a lot, and they seem to understand Party discipline, so they will not make big mistakes; when they discover the mistakes of these cadres that violate Party discipline, they neither criticize and struggle, nor report to the higher-level Party committee and the Party's discipline inspection organs. These comrades do not understand that in the current complex situation where the bourgeoisie and the petty bourgeoisie surround our Party, any Party member, no matter how high his position is, no matter how long his struggle history is, no matter how many theoretical books he has read, if he leaves the supervision of the Party and the masses, if he cannot often scrub away the dust that invades from all sides, then his small mistakes will gradually develop into big mistakes, and individual mistakes will gradually develop into systematic mistakes. Therefore, an attitude of indulgence is objectively conniving at and fostering the mistakes of certain Party members. Some people feel that it is not easy for the Party to train a relatively senior cadre above the county level, and these cadres have made certain contributions to the Party and the revolution. From the perspective of "caring" for cadres and respecting the "contributions" of cadres, the criticism and punishment of their mistakes should be lenient. This idea is also very harmful. It is indeed not easy for our Party to train a relatively senior cadre above the county level, and the Party has always been very caring for them. However, for those cadres who have already violated Party discipline, how should the Party care for them? Obviously, the correct way is to give their mistakes serious criticism and education and necessary punishment with an attitude of curing diseases and saving people, to help them recognize and correct their mistakes, so that they can continue to work for the Party and the people. Because, mistakes that violate Party discipline are different from shortcomings in work style and general mistakes in work. Violating Party discipline is a major mistake of principle. This kind of mistake destroys the Party's unity and solidarity, and seriously damages the interests of the Party and the people. For this serious mistake, it is not enough to give only general criticism and education, but necessary punishments must be given according to the nature of the mistake and the attitude of the offender towards the mistake. On the contrary, if, as some people advocate, their mistakes that violate Party discipline are forgiven in order to "care" for them, and the scale of discipline is relaxed for them, it will foster the privileged thinking of these cadres, making them think that Party discipline and state law are set for "ordinary people" and have nothing to do with themselves, so they will become even more reckless and audacious. This is not caring for cadres, but ruining cadres. Can "great merit" be exempt from the constraints of discipline or relax the constraints of discipline? Of course not, this violates the principle of unified Party discipline, it will relax Party discipline and weaken combat effectiveness. At the same time, this statement of "great merit" is incorrect. All merit should not belong to individuals, but should belong to the Party and the masses of the people. This is a fundamental issue that has been repeatedly elaborated in Marxist-Leninist works.
    To strengthen Party discipline, Party committees and Party discipline inspection organs at all levels must strengthen the following aspects of work:
    Party committees at all levels must strengthen ideological education for Party members and strictly enforce Party organizational life. Party discipline is coercive. However, the strengthening of Party discipline always relies on the consciousness of Party members. This requires Party committees to improve the Marxist-Leninist consciousness of Party members, improve Party members' consciousness of implementing Party discipline, and at the same time, enable Party members to keenly distinguish right from wrong, dare to adhere to principles, and carry out serious struggles against all behaviors that undermine Party discipline. Strict Party organizational life has great positive significance for consolidating Party discipline. The key to improving Party organizational life lies in conscientiously carrying out criticism and self-criticism. Only when criticism and self-criticism are carried out can Party members be subject to the Party's regular inspection and supervision, can they receive the Party's various assistance and education, so as to improve their ideological quality and correct various shortcomings and mistakes in a timely manner. Only when criticism and self-criticism are carried out can various undesirable tendencies within the Party that are detrimental to unity and undermine discipline be exposed and criticized in a timely manner, and those serious behaviors that violate Party discipline can be subject to Party disciplinary sanctions. While improving Party organizational life, Party committees must pay special attention to the organizational life of senior cadres above the county level. This is not only because any Communist Party member is an ordinary Party member within the Party, and must implement the resolutions of the Party organization to which he belongs and accept the supervision of the Party organization, but also because almost all of the Party's relatively senior cadres who have made mistakes do not seriously participate in Party organizational life and do not pay attention to the Party's inspection and supervision.
    Party committees should also strengthen leadership over discipline inspection work. Party committees should regard discipline inspection work as an important aspect of their directly led work, regularly inspect and guide it, and select high-quality cadres to engage in this work. When discipline inspection work encounters difficulties, Party committees should provide timely support so that this work can play an active role in ensuring Party unity and realizing Party resolutions and Party policies.
    Party discipline inspection organs must maintain the seriousness of Party discipline and handle violations of discipline in a spirit of seeking truth from facts. For behaviors that undermine Party unity and violate Party discipline, no matter who he is, Party discipline inspection organs must point them out in a timely manner, order them to correct them, and even give them necessary punishments. Discipline inspection organs may encounter various obstacles in carrying out these tasks. At this time, discipline inspection organs should, under the leadership and support of the Party committee, carry out irreconcilable struggles to maintain the seriousness of Party discipline. In the past, some discipline inspection organs gave up the struggle when they encountered major obstacles, and could not persist in the struggle to maintain Party discipline. This phenomenon should not exist at all. It should be understood that all Party organizations and all organs led by the Party naturally have the responsibility to maintain Party discipline, but Party discipline inspection organs are the specialized departments through which the Party maintains Party discipline. Its duty is to deal with various violations of discipline in a timely manner and maintain the seriousness of Party discipline. If a specialized department that maintains Party discipline also treats disciplinary issues with a liberal attitude, then this Party discipline inspection department has abandoned its duties, it itself has violated Party discipline, and it will seriously damage the seriousness of Party discipline.
    When dealing with disciplinary issues, it is necessary to establish a style of seeking truth from facts. This requires discipline inspection departments not only to obtain the leadership of the Party committee to which they belong, but also to obtain the assistance of Party committees in various places and respect the opinions of Party committees in various places. At the same time, in their work, they must conscientiously implement the mass line, conduct more investigations, more studies, and listen to various different opinions (including the defense opinions of those who have violated discipline), repeatedly verify the facts, conduct specific analyses, and then make correct conclusions and obtain the approval of the Party committee. However, some discipline inspection departments often do not strive for the help of the local Party committee in their work, but a few people go to "handle the case" in isolation. This is very dangerous. It must be seen that the local Party committee and the masses are, in any case, more familiar with the situation and clearer about the essence of the problem than a few discipline inspection cadres temporarily sent there. Without their help, or without respecting their opinions, it is easy to listen to only one side and to deal with the problem improperly. It must be recognized that any deviation in handling disciplinary issues is harmful to Party unity. Therefore, discipline inspection departments must always pay attention to educating cadres and use a style of seeking truth from facts and being modest and prudent to handle problems. Only in this way can we, as instructed by the Fourth Plenary Session of the Party, wage a merciless struggle against those who intentionally undermine Party unity and discipline and persist in not correcting their mistakes; and adopt a policy of being kind to others and curing diseases and saving people towards comrades whose mistakes are not too serious, or who, although their mistakes are relatively serious, are willing to correct them, and conduct serious criticism and necessary struggle according to specific circumstances, so as to "start from unity, and achieve the goal of unity through criticism and struggle."
    Party discipline inspection departments should also work with the Party's propaganda departments and organizational departments to strengthen the education of Party members on Party discipline, so that Party members have a correct understanding of Party discipline. When the Party puts forward a major task, it is necessary to make everyone understand what should be done and what should not be done; what is abiding by discipline and what is violating discipline. As long as the majority of Party members understand the importance of maintaining Party discipline, an atmosphere of abiding by discipline and maintaining discipline will appear within the Party, and the phenomenon of Party members violating discipline will be greatly reduced. Even those individual Party members with very poor discipline will be subject to everyone's accusations and supervision and gradually correct their mistakes. Party discipline will be more consolidated, and Party unity will be effectively guaranteed.

### 加强党的纪律性

    加强党的纪律性
    党的七届四中全会决议指出，党的团结是党的生命，是马克思列宁主义的一个最根本的原理，是革命胜利的基本保证。增强党的团结和加强党的纪律性是分不开的。党的纪律是保证党的团结和实现党的方针政策的有力武器。
    严格党的纪律的目的在于保证党在思想上的一致和行动上的统一。我们党从来都主张扩大党内民主生活，开展批评和自我批评，保证党内不同意见的提出和讨论，主张经过原则问题的论争和研究来消除分歧，取得思想认识的一致。我们党同时也有着自己的严格的组织原则，比如，党员个人服从组织、少数服从多数、下级服从上级、全党服从中央等。党章把严格地遵守党的组织原则和忠实地执行党的政策，把遵守党组织的决议，都规定为党员的义务和党的纪律。这就是说，每一个共产党员，在问题没有作出决定之前有自由发表自己意见的权利；但在问题作出决定之后，不论党员个人和党组织都必须无条件地服从党的组织原则和执行党的政策、决议。共产党员的这种高度自觉的纪律性，保证了全党的行动不论在任何情况下都能够团结一致。
    列宁把党的严格的纪律当做布尔什维克成功的基本条件之一。毛泽东同志在他的许多著作中也一再阐明这个原则，特别是当革命处于重大的历史关头的时候。一九四一年当抗日战争处于最艰苦的时候，党中央发出了关于增强党性的决定，严厉地斥责了党内闹独立性的倾向，要求党内统一意志，统一行动，统一纪律和集中领导，指出“统一纪律，是革命胜利的必要条件”。一九四八年，当解放战争即将取得全国胜利的时候，毛泽东同志又指示全党干部研究列宁的“共产主义运动中的‘左派’幼稚病”第二章，他说：“请同志们看此书的第二章，使同志们懂得必须消灭现在存在于我们工作中的某些严重的无纪律状态，或无政府状态”。在中共中央宣传部重印此书第二章的前言中又指出：“要保持已得的胜利并继续胜利，和达到全国规模的胜利，集中的革命纪律，便具有头等的决定的意义”。目前，当我们处于实行社会主义革命的紧要历史关头，党的四中全会又做出了增强党的团结的决议。这是有重大历史意义的。
    目前，党的纪律性和党的纪律执行情况是否完全符合于党中央、毛泽东同志历次的指示和四中全会决议所强调的精神呢？从全党的范围来看，绝大多数的党员都能自觉地遵守党的纪律；各级党组织对于执行纪律一般是严肃的，因而党的纪律基本上是巩固的。但是，这决不是说，在我们党内所有党员的纪律性都已经很好，所有的党组织都同样严肃认真地执行党的纪律。事实是在我们党内，还有一部分党员的纪律性很差。而特别值得引起警惕的是一部分县级以上比较高级的干部，被工作中的若干成绩冲昏了头脑，骄傲自大，无视党的原则和纪律。他们常常借口自己所在的地区或部门“情况特殊”、“工作先进”，自己意见“一贯正确”，而拒不执行党的政策，甚至狂妄地扬言“出了问题，有我来抗”；他们不遵守党的民主集中制和集体领导的原则，宣传个人威信，强调个人作用与党对抗；他们只能听人奉承，不能接受批评，甚至对批评者施行打击报复；他们在党内进行宗派活动，拉拉扯扯，散布流言蜚语，挑拨党内关系，破坏党的团结；他们实行派别性的干部政策，以求达到个人的卑鄙的目的；他们把自己所在的地区和部门当成个人的资本和独立王国，不受党的纪律约束，抗拒党的检查和监督，并且把党的纪律当成排斥异己、维护个人名誉地位和巩固独立王国的工具。在这些大大小小的个别地区和大大小小的个别部门，党的纪律就遭到了严重的破坏。
    另一方面，在我们党内有一些人对于这种严重的违反纪律的现象，也采取了自由主义和纵容姑息的态度。有些人认为，这些比较高级的干部现在独立负责着县以上的一个地区的领导工作，或者独立负责着一个重要部门的领导工作，他们斗争历史长，觉悟程度似乎很高，马克思列宁主义理论似乎懂得很不少，似乎懂得党的纪律，因而不会犯大错误；当他们发现了这些干部的违反党纪的错误的时候，既不批评斗争，也不向上级党委和党的纪律检查机关反映。这些同志不了解，在目前资产阶级和小资产阶级包围着我们党的复杂情况下，任何一个党员不管他职位多么高，不管他斗争历史多么长，不管他读了多少理论书籍，如果离开了党和群众的监督，如果不能经常擦洗从各方面侵袭来的灰尘，那么，就会使他的小错误逐渐发展成大错误，个别的错误逐渐发展成系统的错误。因此，纵容姑息的态度，在客观上就是放纵和助长某些党员的错误。有些人觉得党培养一个比较高级的干部很不容易，而这些干部对党对革命又有一定的功劳，从“爱护”干部和尊重干部的“功劳”着想，对他们的错误的批评和处分应该从宽。这种想法也是十分有害的。我们党培养一个县级以上的比较高级的干部确实是很不容易的，党对他们从来也都是十分爱护的。但是，对那些已经违反了党的纪律的干部，党应该怎样来爱护他们呢？很明显的，正确的办法只有以治病救人的态度对他们的错误给予严肃的批评教育和必要的处分，以帮助他们认识并改正错误，使他们能够继续为党为人民工作。因为，违反党的纪律的错误，不同于作风上的缺点和工作中的一般性的错误。违反了党的纪律是带原则性的重大错误，这种错误破坏着党的统一团结，严重地损害着党和人民的利益。对于这种严重的错误，不能仅仅给予一般的批评教育，而必须根据错误的性质和犯错误者对错误的态度而给予应得的处分。相反地，如果像有些人所主张的那样，为了“爱护”他们而原谅他们违反党纪的错误，对他们放宽纪律的尺度，就会助长这些干部的特权思想，使他们认为党纪国法都是为“普通人”而设的，与自己无关，因而有恃无恐地更加胆大妄为。这不是什么爱护干部，而是毁坏干部。“功劳大”是否就可以不受纪律的约束或者把纪律约束放松一些呢？当然不能，这是违反党的统一纪律的原则的，它将使党的纪律松懈，战斗力削弱。同时，“功劳大”的这种说法就是不对的，一切功劳都不应当属于个人，而应当属于党和人民群众，这是马克思列宁主义著作中一再阐述了的根本问题。
    要加强党的纪律性，各级党委和党的纪律检查机关必须加强以下几方面的工作：
    各级党委必须加强对党员的思想教育并严格党的组织生活。党的纪律是带有强制性的。但是，党的纪律的加强，在任何时候都是依靠党员的自觉。这就需要党委提高党员的马克思列宁主义的觉悟性，提高党员执行党的纪律的自觉性，同时，使党员能够锐敏地辨别是非，勇于坚持原则，同一切破坏党纪的行为进行严肃的斗争。严格党内组织生活对于巩固党的纪律有着很大的积极意义。健全党的组织生活的关键在于认真地开展批评和自我批评。只有批评和自我批评开展了，党员才能受到党的经常的检查和监督，才能得到党的各种帮助和教育，从而提高思想品质和及时纠正各种缺点错误。只有批评和自我批评开展了，党内各种不利于团结和破坏纪律的不良倾向才能及时受到揭发和批判，那些严重的违反党纪的行为才能受到党的纪律制裁。在健全党的组织生活的同时，党委必须特别注意县级以上的高级干部的组织生活。这不仅是因为任何一个共产党员在党内都是一个普通党员，都必须执行所属党组织的决议和接受党组织的监督，也还因为凡是犯了错误的党的比较高级的干部，几乎都是不认真参加党的组织生活和不重视党的检查和监督的。
    党委还应该加强对纪律检查工作的领导。党委要把纪律检查工作当作自己直接领导的工作的一个重要方面，经常加以检查和指导，并挑选质量好的干部去从事这一工作。当纪律检查工作遇到困难的时候，党委要及时地给予支持，使这一工作能够在保证党的团结、在实现党的决议和党的政策方面发挥积极的作用。
    党的纪律检查机关，必须维护党的纪律的严肃性，并以实事求是的精神处理违反纪律的问题。对于破坏党的团结、违反党的纪律的行为，不管他是什么人，党的纪律检查机关都必须及时指出，令其改正，以至给以必要的处分。纪律检查机关在进行这些工作中可能会遇到各种阻碍。这时，纪律检查机关就应该在党委的领导和支持下，为维护党的纪律的严肃性进行不调和的斗争。过去，有些纪律检查机关在遇到较大的障碍时就放弃斗争，就不能为维护党的纪律而坚持斗争，这种现象是完全不应该有的。应该了解，党的一切组织和党所领导的一切机关，自然都有责任来维护党的纪律，但是党的纪律检查机关却是党借以维护党的纪律的专职的部门。它的职责就在于及时处理各种违反纪律的问题，维护党的纪律的严肃性，如果某一个维护党的纪律的专职部门也以自由主义的态度来对待纪律问题，那末，这一党的纪律检查部门，就放弃了自己的职务，它本身就违反了党的纪律，就会严重地损害党的纪律的严肃性。
    在处理纪律问题的时候，必须树立实事求是的作风。这就要求纪律检查部门不但要取得所属党委的领导，而且必须取得各地党委的帮助，尊重各地党委的意见。同时，在工作中必须认真地贯彻群众路线，多调查，多研究，多听取各种不同的意见（包括违反纪律的人的辩护意见），反复对证事实，进行具体分析，而后作出正确的结论并经党委批准。但是，也有些纪律检查部门在工作中往往不争取当地党委的帮助，而是几个人孤立地去“办案”。这样做是十分危险的。必须看到，当地党委和群众无论如何都要比几个临时派去的纪律检查干部更熟悉情况，更清楚问题的本质。离开他们的帮助，或不尊重他们的意见，就容易偏听偏信，对问题处理不当。必须认识到，在处理纪律问题上的任何偏差都是有害于党的团结的。因此，纪律检查部门必须时刻注意教育干部，用实事求是和谦虚慎重的作风来处理问题。只有这样，才能做到像党的四中全会所指示的那样，对于那些有意破坏党的团结和纪律而又坚持不改正错误的分子进行无情的斗争；对于错误不太严重，或虽然比较严重但愿意改正的同志，采取与人为善和治病救人的方针，根据具体情况进行严肃的批评和必要的斗争，做到“从团结出发，经过批评和斗争达到团结的目的”。
    党的纪律检查部门还应该协同党的宣传部门和组织部门加强对党员进行党的纪律教育，使党员对党的纪律有正确的认识。在党提出每一个重大任务的时候，要使大家都懂得那些是应该做的，那些是不应该做的；那些是遵守纪律的，那些是违反纪律的。只要大多数的党员都懂得了维护党的纪律的重要性，党内就会出现一种遵守纪律和维护纪律的空气，党内违反纪律的现象就会大大减少。就是那些个别纪律性很差的党员，也将会受到大家的指责、监督而逐渐改正错误。党的纪律将更加巩固，党的团结将得到有力的保证。
