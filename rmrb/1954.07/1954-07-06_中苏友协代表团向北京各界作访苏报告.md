Xinhua News Agency, July 5th: In order to further learn from the Soviet people's valuable construction experience and noble moral qualities, and to further promote the great friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples, the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association is sponsoring the "Report Meeting of the All-China Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Delegation on Returning from Attending the 'May Day' Celebrations in the Soviet Union," inviting the delegation leader and members to report on their visit to the Soviet Union to the people of Beijing.

The head of the delegation, Qian Junrui, was invited on the evening of the 5th to give a report entitled "How the Soviet People Work and Live" to more than 4,000 cadres from Beijing's government organs, military units, and factories, and was warmly welcomed by the audience.

Qian Junrui first introduced the Soviet people's socialist attitude towards labor. He cited many specific and vivid examples to illustrate how the Soviet people cherish every minute and every second of labor time. He said that the Soviet people regard labor as the most basic right and obligation; they love labor as they love their own lives; labor has become the greatest pleasure in the lives of the Soviet people. No matter what kind of work the Soviet people do, they respect and cherish their work very much; anyone who shows contempt for his work will be considered the greatest insult to him.

Qian Junrui said that the Soviet people live a prosperous and cultured life, but on the other hand, they are very simple, especially the leaders at all levels.

He focused on the iron-like unity of all the Soviet people around the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government. He said that the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government enjoy the highest prestige among the people; at the same time, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government are unreservedly concerned about the people of the whole country. Based on the delegation's experience in visiting the Soviet Union, he said that the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government are vigorously adopting various effective measures, such as strengthening collective leadership and specific leadership, fully developing criticism and self-criticism, and resolutely opposing bureaucracy and paperwork, in order to further strengthen their leadership work and more firmly unite all working people to complete the various great tasks of communist construction.

The members of the delegation have also begun to make extensive reports on their visit to the Soviet Union to government organs, mass organizations, factories, construction sites, military units, and literary and art circles in Beijing. They will also communicate through broadcasts, publishing articles, and holding symposiums.

    中苏友协代表团向北京各界作访苏报告
    【新华社五日讯】为进一步学习苏联人民的宝贵的建设经验和崇高的道德品质并进一步促进中苏两国人民的伟大友谊，北京市中苏友好协会特主办“中苏友好协会总会赴苏联参加‘五一’节观礼代表团归国报告会”，邀请代表团团长和团员们向北京市各界人民进行访苏报告。
    代表团团长钱俊瑞在五日晚应邀向北京市各机关、部队、工厂的干部四千多人作了“苏联人民怎样工作和生活”的报告，受到听众的热烈欢迎。
    钱俊瑞首先介绍了苏联人民对待劳动的社会主义的态度。他举了很多具体生动的事例说明苏联人民是怎样爱惜每一分每一秒的劳动时间。他说，苏联人民把劳动看作最基本的权利和义务；他们热爱劳动就如热爱自己的生命；劳动已经成为苏联人民生活中最大的愉快。苏联人民不管是干的什么工作，都非常尊重和珍爱自己的工作；谁要对他的工作表示轻视，他便认为这是对他的最大侮辱。
    钱俊瑞说，苏联人民过着富裕的和文化的生活，而另一面他们却又十分朴素，尤其是各级负责人，更是如此。
    他着重介绍了苏联全体人民围绕着苏联共产党和苏联政府的钢铁般的团结。他说，苏联共产党和苏联政府在人民中享有最高的威信；同时，苏联共产党和苏联政府对于全国人民是无微不至地关怀。他根据代表团访苏的体会说，苏联共产党和苏联政府正大力采取各种有效的措施，如加强集体领导和具体领导，充分开展批评与自我批评，坚决反对官僚主义和文牍主义等，以便更加加强自己的领导工作，更加巩固地团结全体劳动人民，以完成共产主义建设的各项伟大任务。
    代表团的团员们也已经开始向北京市各机关、群众团体、工厂、建筑工地、部队及文艺界作广泛的访苏传达报告。他们还将通过广播、发表文章及举办座谈会等办法进行传达。
