Rescuing the Pile Driver
Fujian Province, Lianjiang Pukou Town Stevedore, Chen Zengliang

At three o'clock in the deep night, when people were sound asleep, the district chief's office was suddenly awakened by a telephone. It was a call from the county: "The pile driver on the Ao River Bridge has been washed away by the flood. Please send someone immediately to rescue it!" The news reached the Pukou Town Stevedores' Union. Stevedores Sun Yonghe and six others bravely accepted the task, took the necessary tools, and set off immediately in a small boat.

The boundless fields were pitch black, and the rain was pouring down relentlessly. The small boat advanced against the flood. The seven workers on the boat were like seven scouts, constantly looking around, hoping to be the first to discover the pile driver that had been washed away. But where was the pile driver? Not even a shadow. The small boat continued to advance, dropping anchor not far from Pukou. After the boat stopped for a while, a large object was indeed discovered upstream, rushing quickly towards the bow of the boat. The workers saw that it was the pile driver and were very happy. But the current was so rapid, and the boat was so small. How could they rescue this heavy machine? Time did not allow for consideration. If they were late, the machine would be swept away by the flood. Sun Yonghe, standing at the bow of the boat, quickly raised a bamboo hook and hooked it onto the base of the pile driver (made of wooden rafts). Almost at the same time as he hooked the pile driver, the boat's anchor rope was broken by the base, and the boat drifted downstream with the pile driver. It was difficult for Sun Yonghe, who was on the boat, to hook a machine weighing more than a ton. But he thought that the state's property must not be lost, so he held on to the bamboo hook tightly. Just as he was thinking of a better plan, he was dragged into the water. At this time, he knew that grasping the machine would not help, so he released the bamboo hook, let go of the pile driver, struggled out of the water, grabbed the boat's anchor rope, and hung on the side of the boat like this, his lower body submerged in the water, drifting downstream. The small boat drifted along the rapid current for six or seven miles, and was about to flow into the sea near Dongdai Village. Fortunately, the Ao River estuary was relatively wide, and the current was gentler, so it was not too difficult to control the small boat. The workers, disregarding their fatigue, quickly rescued the rows of bamboo and the large fir logs to a safe place on the river beach. As soon as the fir logs were secured, the workers prepared to look for the pile driver again.
  "Comrades, let's continue to look for the machine!" Sun Yonghe, who was dozing off, heard this shout. He had just woken up and was very dizzy, but still wanted to go with everyone. Everyone persuaded him to stay and watch the fir logs and the boat, but he wouldn't listen.

The rain had not stopped, and it was already dawn. The seven of them walked along the muddy river beach. Some people thought to themselves: maybe the machine was swallowed by the sea long ago, and it would be futile to look for it again. But most people thought that as long as there was a glimmer of hope, they should continue to search. When they arrived at the estuary, they found the pile driver stranded, shaking uncertainly, in the water seventy or eighty steps away from the beach. At this time, personnel from the Fourth Engineering Bureau who had come to look for the pile driver also arrived by boat. With the cooperation of the engineering bureau's personnel, the workers waded through the water and carried the pile driver, along with its base, to the beach. That night, they dismantled the parts of the pile driver one by one and carefully placed them on the boat. On the morning of the third day, this Soviet-style pile driver, worth 240 million yuan, was safely transported to Pukou.

    抢救打桩机
    福建省连江浦口镇搬运工人　陈增良
    深夜三点钟，人们正在酣睡，区长办公室忽然响起了电话铃声。这是县上来的电话：“鳌江大桥打桩机被洪水冲去了，请火速派人前往抢救！”消息传到了浦口镇搬运工会，搬运工人孙永和等七人勇敢地接受了任务，带上必要的工具，划着一条小船，立刻出发了。
    无边的田野漆黑一团，大雨没命地下着，小船冒着洪流前进。船上七个工人就像七个侦察员，一刻不停地四下探望着，谁都希望第一个发现到被水冲去的打桩机。可是哪里有什么打桩机呢？连个影子也没有。小船继续往前推进，在离浦口不远的地方抛下了碇。船停了不一会，果然发现上游有一庞然大物，向船头迅速冲来，工人们一看是打桩机，高兴得很。但水流那么急，船又小，怎能把这笨重的机器救起来呢？时间不容许考虑，迟了机器就要被洪水卷走，站在船头的孙永和迅速举起竹钩子往打桩机的机座（木排做成的）就钩。差不多与他钩住打桩机的同时，小船的碇索被机座打断了，随着打桩机向下游漂去。孙永和身在船上，要钩住一吨多重的机器是很困难的。但他想国家财产决不能损失，便死抓住竹钩不放。正当他寻思更好的计谋时，却被拖落到水里去了。这时他知道抓住机器也无济于事，便松了竹钩子，放走打桩机，自己从水中挣扎起来，抓住船头的碇索，就这样吊在船边，下半身沉在水里，一直向下游漂去。小船顺着急流漂了六、七里远，快到了东岱村，船稍许安定些，船上人立刻抛下了第二只船碇，把吊在船边的孙永和救上船来。这时他已脸色全变，疲惫到了极点。伙伴们用棉被把他包了起来，让他静静休息。
    工人们仍然没有丝毫灰心，他们商量着继续寻找机器。大家正议论时，上游突然又漂来了一批木材——五排竹子和十二根大杉木。还没有来得及商量怎样挡住这批杉木，小船的碇索又被木头打断了，小船连同木排一直被漂到离浦口十多里远的巡坞村，转眼就要流入大海了，幸好鳌江口江面比较宽阔，水流和缓些，控制小船没有多大困难。工人们也顾不得疲劳，迅速地把一排排竹子和一根根大杉木抢救到河滩上的安全地方。杉木刚安置停当，工人又准备再去寻找打桩机，
  “伙伴们，继续找机器去呀！”这喊声被昏睡着的孙永和听到了，他刚刚醒过来，头晕得厉害，仍然要跟大伙一起去，大家劝他留着看管杉木和船，他怎么样也不听。
    大雨还没有停，天已亮了。七个人沿着泥泞的河滩走着。有的人暗想：也许机器早叫大海吞去了，再找也是徒劳无益。但大多数人的想法是，只要有一分希望，就要继续寻找。到了海口时，发现离海滩七八十步远的水中，打桩机摇晃不定地搁着。这时，第四工程处前来寻找打桩机的人员，也乘船赶到了，在工程处人员的配合下，工人们涉着大水，把打桩机连同机座抬到海滩上去。他们连夜把打桩机的机件一件件拆了下来，妥善地安顿在船上，第三天上午，这部价值两亿四千万元的仿苏式打桩机已安全运抵浦口。
