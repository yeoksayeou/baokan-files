    Shanghai Steel Window Factory's New Plant Begins Production
    The newly built factory and newly installed machines of the jointly-owned (public-private) Shanghai Steel Window Factory have been put into production.
    The new factory covers an area of more than twenty mu, approximately ten times larger than the old factory. The number of machines installed in the new factory is six times greater than in the old factory, and output will also increase greatly. This factory will undertake the task of manufacturing steel windows to support construction needs throughout the country.
    Currently, this steel window factory is manufacturing a large batch of automated steel windows designed according to Soviet steel window specifications for the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant.
    The Shanghai Steel Window Factory was reorganized into a jointly-owned (public-private) enterprise in January 1952. In 1953, the state made a substantial investment in the enterprise and began construction of new factory buildings and expansion of machinery and equipment.

    上海钢窗厂新建厂房开始生产
    公私合营上海钢窗厂的新建厂房和新安装的机器已经投入生产。
    新厂共占地二十多亩，比旧厂约宽大十倍。新厂安装的机器比旧厂增加了六倍，产量亦将大大增加，这个厂将担负支援全国各地建设需要的钢窗制造任务。
    现在，这个钢窗厂正为第一汽车制造厂制造大批按照苏联钢窗规格设计的自动化钢窗。
    公私合营上海钢窗厂是在一九五二年一月改组为公私合营企业的。一九五三年国家对这个企业进行了较大的投资，开始兴建新的厂房和扩充机器设备。
