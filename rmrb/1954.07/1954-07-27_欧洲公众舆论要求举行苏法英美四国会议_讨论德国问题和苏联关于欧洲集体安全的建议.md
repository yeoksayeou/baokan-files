Xinhua News Agency, July 25th, Berlin dispatch: Erich Ollenhauer, Chairman of the German Social Democratic Party, has called for a reconvening of the Four Power Conference to discuss the establishment of collective security. In a speech at the German Social Democratic Party Congress on July 21st, Ollenhauer criticized Western nations for “dismissing without serious discussion” the Soviet proposal for an “All-European Treaty guaranteeing European collective security” made at the Berlin Four Foreign Ministers Conference. Ollenhauer then pointed out: There is no reason to reject Four Power talks, and further negotiations cannot be described as hopeless.
    
Xinhua News Agency, July 26th, London dispatch: Italian Socialist Party leader Nenni, who is currently visiting Britain, has advocated holding a new Four Power Conference to resolve the German question. Answering questions at a press conference, Nenni said he believed the proposal to convene such a high-level meeting "would be supported by Italian public opinion" and indicated that this should become a guiding principle for the Italian government in formulating its foreign policy.
    
Xinhua News Agency, July 25th, London dispatch: British Labour Party MP Bevan suggested in a pamphlet published by the "Tribune" weekly that the Soviet Union, Britain, France, and the United States should reconvene to discuss issues such as a peace treaty with Germany and German reunification. Bevan criticized the policies adopted by the United States and Britain on the German question, believing that such policies "will destroy the last chance of reaching an agreement with the Soviet Union, thereby achieving the peaceful reunification of Germany."
    The pamphlet was also signed by Labour Party National Executive Committee members Wilson and Mikardo.
    
Xinhua News Agency, July 26th, TASS London dispatch: British Labour Party MP Michael Foot published an article in the "Tribune" weekly. In the article, Foot said that the news of the restoration of peace in Indochina was "the best possible news. An unimaginable catastrophe has been prevented." He said: "If the conflict has stopped in Indochina, why can't it do so in Germany? The British government has a duty to seize the opportunity to convene a new conference to put forward new and constructive proposals that would allow European problems to be resolved."
    
Labour MP Anthony Greenwood said in a speech in Newcastle that "the victory of patience and common sense in Geneva is an objective lesson for those shameful defeatists who believe that the Cold War is inevitable... Now is the time for us to express our willingness to delay our dangerous plans to rearm Germany and to begin serious negotiations with Russia on the reunification of Germany."
    
Former Labour government Trade Minister Harold Wilson suggested in a speech in Weston-super-Mare that a Four Power Conference be held on the German question and that the establishment of the "European Defense Community" be halted. Wilson said that the armistice agreement reached in Geneva this week proved that achievements can be made if both sides have a sincere desire to seek peace. Wilson continued: "If we did the same in Berlin, then we may have achieved even greater success in resolving the German question."

    欧洲公众舆论要求举行苏法英美四国会议
    讨论德国问题和苏联关于欧洲集体安全的建议
    【新华社二十五日讯】柏林消息：德国社会民主党主席埃里希·奥伦豪尔要求重新召开四国会议，讨论建立集体安全的问题。奥伦豪尔七月二十一日在德国社会民主党代表大会上发表演说，他批评西方国家“没有认真讨论就撇开”苏联在柏林四国外长会议上所提出的“保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约”的建议。奥伦豪尔接着指出：没有理由拒绝四国会谈，不能把进一步谈判说成是没有希望的。
      【新华社二十六日讯】伦敦消息：正在英国进行访问的意大利社会党领袖南尼主张召开一次新的四国会议来解决德国问题。南尼在记者招待会上回答问题时说，他相信召开这种高级会议的主张“将得到意大利舆论的支持”，并表示这一点应成为意大利政府制订外交政策的方针。
    【新华社二十五日讯】伦敦消息：英国工党议员比万在“论坛”周报发行的一本小册子里建议，苏联、英国、法国和美国应该重新举行会议，讨论有关对德和约及全德统一等问题。比万指责美英两国在德国问题上所采取的政策，认为这种政策“将破坏和苏联达成协议从而使德国实现和平统一的最后机会。”
    在这本小册子上签名的人中还有工党全国执行委员会委员威尔逊和米卡多。
    【新华社二十六日讯】据塔斯社伦敦讯：英国工党议员迈克尔·福特在“论坛”周报上发表了一篇文章。福特在文章中说印度支那恢复和平的消息，是“一个最好的消息。难以想像的巨大灾难被防止了。”他说：“如果冲突在印度支那停止了，那么在德国为什么不能这样呢？英国政府有责任尽量抓住召开新会议的机会，以便提出使欧洲问题得以解决的新的和建设性的建议。”
    工党议员安东尼·格林伍德在新卡斯尔发表演说时说，“耐心和常识在日内瓦取得的胜利对那些认为冷战不可避免的可耻的失败主义者是一个客观的教训……。现在是我们表示愿意延迟我们的重新武装德国的危险计划而开始就重新统一德国的问题和俄国进行认真的谈判的时候了。”
    前工党政府贸易大臣哈罗德·威尔逊在威斯敦—苏柏尔—马尔演说时建议就德国问题举行四国会议，并停止建立“欧洲防务集团”。威尔逊说，这个星期在日内瓦达成的停战协定证明，如果双方有谋求和平的真诚愿望，就能够取得成就。威尔逊接着说：“如果我们在柏林也这样做的话，那么，我们在解决德国问题上可能已获得了更大的成绩。”
