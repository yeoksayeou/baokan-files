Statement by the Royal Government of Laos

    The Royal Government of Laos is determined never to participate in a policy of aggression and will never permit Lao territory to be used to serve such a policy.
    The Royal Government of Laos will not enter into any agreement with other countries if such agreement includes obligations for the Royal Government of Laos to participate in military alliances that do not conform to the principles of the United Nations Charter or the principles of the Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities, or that include obligations to establish bases for foreign military forces on Lao territory when its security is not threatened.
    The Royal Government of Laos is determined to resolve its international disputes by peaceful means and in a manner that does not endanger international peace and security and justice.
    During the period from the cessation of hostilities in Vietnam until the final settlement of the political problems of that country, the Royal Government of Laos is determined to request foreign assistance concerning war materiel, personnel, or instructors only in the interests of effectively defending its own territory, and only within the scope stipulated by the Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities.

    老挝王国政府声明
    老挝王国政府决意永不参与侵略政策，并永不允许老挝的领土被利用来为此种政策服务。
    老挝王国政府将不与其他国家缔结任何协定，如果此项协定包括使老挝王国政府参加不符合联合国宪章原则的或停止敌对行动协定的原则的军事同盟的义务，或包括当其安全不受威胁时在老挝领土上为外国军事力量建立基地的义务。
    老挝王国政府决意以和平方法并以不危及国际和平和安全以及正义之方式来解决其国际纠纷。
    在越南敌对行动停止之日至该国政治问题最后解决之期间，老挝王国政府决意仅为了有效地保卫本国领土的利益，才要求有关战争物资、人员或教官的外国援助，并仅限于停止敌对行动协定所规定的范围之内。
