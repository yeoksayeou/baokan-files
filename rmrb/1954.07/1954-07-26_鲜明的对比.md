    "The Last Stage" and "Rebuilding Warsaw" are part of the excellent Polish film works screened during the "Polish People's Republic Film Week." Like other films shown at this film week, they excellently reflect the Polish people's great struggle against the German invaders and in building their motherland. These films have received international acclaim.

    These films, encompassing different themes and rich in ideological education and artistic characteristics, will allow Chinese audiences to recognize the brilliant achievements of the Polish people's film culture over the past decade. At the same time, through the vivid images of ordinary people on the screen, they will also enable the broad masses of our people to further understand the Polish people, enhance the fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Polish people, and make us feel their heroic spirit and labor enthusiasm, thereby strengthening our confidence and strength in defending the cause of peace.

    "The Last Stage" records one of the monstrous crimes committed by the Hitler gang during World War II—the Auschwitz concentration camp massacre—on the silver screen, preserving it forever for future generations of mankind. This film plays a significant role in educating today's and future people to be vigilant and prevent the revival of fascism. At the same time, this work also sings the praises of the people's strong and unyielding struggle, which is also a great source of encouragement for the audience.

    "Rebuilding Warsaw" is an outstanding documentary. It preserves the historical traces of the Polish people reviving their capital, which was systematically destroyed by the German bandits. Under Hitler's mad orders to "destroy Warsaw" and "destroy everything where there are potatoes," 85 percent of Warsaw's buildings were destroyed. At that time, the Nazi bandits even shamelessly boasted of their crimes, saying that Warsaw was now just a geographical name. But immediately following Poland's liberation, the heroic people immediately threw themselves into a construction frenzy. A new capital was born from the ruins.

    The two films show the audience a sharp contrast: fascism means the destruction of the people's material and cultural life, even to the point of annihilation, while socialism means the creation and continuous improvement of the people's material and cultural life.

    In "Rebuilding Warsaw," the audience's eyes follow the slowly moving aerial shots of the movie camera, and they can see a terrible and heartbreaking picture: most of the city of Warsaw, which had been built for more than 700 years, has become a scene of broken walls and ruins, and the Jewish quarter has been burned to rubble. This is precisely the goal pursued by the fascist bandits. They systematically divided the "work" of destroying Warsaw into "stages" to "complete," and triumphantly reported their "achievements" to their "Führer." Then we see this shot: when Hitler announced this news, which contained so much blood and tears, in the parliament, there were many clapping hands—hands that were a hundred times more ferocious than the claws of jackals. The camera then connects to a panoramic view of the ruins: piles and piles of high walls with only empty windows remaining. At this time, the sound transmitted from the film's soundtrack is not some sad tune of music, but the jubilant applause from the fascist parliament! Such a concise and ingenious artistic treatment has allowed the audience to deeply feel what the artist wants to say and to believe that these words are correct. Fascism—the final stage of capitalist development, a form that nakedly exposes its own essence—for foreign countries, means aggression and the destruction of the construction achievements of other people over many centuries, the destruction of their peaceful lives, and the use of the suffering and death of millions of people as a pleasure for a small group of ambitious individuals!

    However, enlightened people will never allow them to run rampant like this. They are temporarily betrayed by the bourgeois ruling group and enslaved by the invaders, but under the leadership of the Party, they will awaken and take action. They are not only able to drive away the fascist occupiers, but also have endless wisdom and strength to rebuild their destroyed homes and build them even better.

    "Rebuilding Warsaw" is an ode to the Polish people's overcoming of tremendous difficulties and carrying out large-scale national construction work. The builders it praises are the residents of Warsaw, these ordinary men, women, and children. From shoveling away mountains of garbage, to installing door frames and window panes one by one, to building a magnificent street lined with giant buildings, the film meticulously depicts the people's hard work and achievements.

    It is not just about "rebuilding." The film introduces the past residences of Warsaw's workers, which lacked sunlight and were filled with coal smoke, but now beautiful workers' residences have been built in the central area of the metropolis. These houses belong to the people and are no longer tools of exploitation for landlords and property owners.

    It is not just about building some structures that can provide shelter from the wind and rain, but about fully meeting the people's cultural needs and aesthetic needs, and about preserving and promoting national cultural traditions. The Old Town of Warsaw, one of the architectural masterpieces of the Renaissance, is being restored to its original state after experts' research, requiring that even the doors and windows and all the interior decorations, peeling murals, and street lamps be restored without any deviation from their original appearance, until they are exactly the same as in ancient paintings.

    Poland has gained a reputation in Europe as a new country rich in "architectural beauty."

    Moreover, the speed of construction is unprecedented in the world. The saying "Polish speed" is circulating in Europe.

    This is the Polish people's forceful answer to the Nazi destroyers. This is a living example of how the people, under the leadership of the Party, can exert great power and create miracles.

    On one side is the laboring people's self-sacrificing, heroic, and creative labor; on the other side is the selfish and self-serving plunder of the fascists—the warmongers of monopoly capitalism—and the tyrannical destruction of the cultural essence accumulated by mankind over thousands of years. What a strong contrast this is!

    "The Last Stage" and "Rebuilding Warsaw" also give the audience a sharp contrast: fascism is the shameful degradation of human morality, and socialism is the unlimited improvement of noble human qualities. Fascism not only means the destruction of material culture, but also the destruction of people, and the extreme contempt for life; socialism not only means the construction of material culture, but also the transformation of people, respect for people, and respect for life.

    "The Last Stage" is a feature film, but it is also a documentary record. The exterior shots were filmed at the Auschwitz concentration camp site, and even the crowded three-tiered bunk beds are original. If one consults the written records of the situation at the time, the reader will know that many of the scenes and plots of prisoner abuse in the film are based on the real life at the time. It's just that the film could not fully expose the fascist atrocities, which were many times darker than what is currently shown.

    Even if those atrocities are only hinted at and mentioned in passing, the audience will be shocked by the destruction of humanity among the Nazi bandits and Polish traitors. They competed with each other in killing speed, boasted of their killing numbers, and discussed plans to "improve" killing methods with relish. The leaders of the bandits awarded holidays to the murderers for their subordinates' random shooting of female prisoners. They embezzled prisoners' medicines and food. They listened to records while abusing prisoners. They treated poisoning babies as entertainment. They robbed toys from the hands of children heading to the gas chambers.

    In the Auschwitz concentration camp, which has been turned into a memorial hall, a large number of prisoners' belongings that the German bandits did not have time to transport are still preserved today. On the one hand, they implemented Hitler's terrible population extermination plan, and on the other hand, they carried out the largest-scale theft, stripping clothes from every prisoner, feeling for coins, knocking out gold teeth, cutting hair, unloading artificial legs... classifying them, and transporting them back to the country to become war expenses or as gifts for their wives and children...

    They held dances under the chimneys burning people.

    They proudly admired that their children could actually learn from them, shouting that they wanted to kill people too.

    They also tore each other apart like dogs.

    But right next to these bestialized people, another kind of person, unarmed and unable to defend themselves, heroically resisted violence, standing tall like pine trees in the snow and ice, protecting the people, and defending their compatriots and the working people of other countries. They would rather die themselves, but give the life-saving medicines to unknown fellow sufferers. They risked their lives to encourage the masses to resist the enemy. They fearlessly carried out underground activities next to the enemy's bed. They sang as they walked to the execution ground...

    What a sharp contrast these radiant and sublime personalities are to the cowardly and despicable lives of the fascist bandits!

    Both films show the generous and selfless assistance of the Soviet government and people to the Polish people; they show the heroic deeds of Soviet communists and Red Army soldiers. In "The Last Stage," we see a typical image like Ye Niang, and in "Rebuilding Warsaw," we see a Soviet soldier who participated in the liberation of Warsaw writing his signature on a broken wall. In the construction work in Warsaw, the Soviet people extended their hand to support Poland again. The Polish people sincerely thank the Soviet Union and the Soviet people. They, like the people of the world, regard the Soviet Union as their liberator and protector.

    The socialist system and the people under the socialist system are in sharp contrast to the fascist system and the accomplices under the fascist system.

    Watching these films can make people think of the current international situation: on the one hand, the rapid development of socialist countries and people's democratic countries in peaceful construction and their efforts to ease international tensions; on the other hand, the US imperialists are still unwilling to give up their repeatedly bankrupt policy of strength, and warmongers are constantly testing atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs in the Pacific Ocean, repeating the old dream of destroying mankind and destroying culture. This contrast is also sharp and strong.

    鲜明的对比

    “最后阶段”编剧兼导演：万达·亚古保斯卡等  制片：波兰电影制片厂  译制：东北电影制片厂  翻译：黎歌、刘迟
    “重建华沙”编辑：史·尚考夫司基等  导演：鲁·帕司基  制片：波兰文献电影制片厂  译制：上海电影制片厂  翻译：陈叙一
    “最后阶段”和“重建华沙”是“波兰人民共和国电影周”中映出的优秀的波兰电影作品的一部分。它们和其他在此次电影周中放映的影片一样，都卓越地反映了波兰人民反抗德国侵略者和建设自己祖国的伟大斗争。这些影片曾经得到了国际上的奖誉。
    这些包括不同题材的、富有思想教育意义和艺术特色的影片将使中国观众认识波兰人民电影文化事业十年来的光辉成就；同时，通过银幕上的普通人民的鲜明形象，也将使我国广大人民进一步地了解波兰人民，增进中波人民的兄弟友谊，并使我们感受到他们的英勇气概和劳动热情，从而加强我们对保卫和平事业的信心和力量。
    “最后阶段”把希特勒匪帮在第二次世界大战中所犯滔天罪行之一——奥斯威辛集中营的大屠杀，记载在银幕的史册上，永远保存给人类的后代。这部影片对于教育今天的以及未来的人民必须警惕和防止法西斯主义的复活，是有很大作用的。这部作品同时歌颂了人民的坚强不屈的斗争，这对于观众也是有很大鼓舞力量的。
    “重建华沙”是一部杰出的纪录片。它保存了波兰人民复兴被德寇有计划地破坏的首都的史迹。在希特勒的“毁灭华沙”、“毁灭一切有马铃薯的地方”的疯狂命令下，华沙的建筑物被毁了百分之八十五。当时纳粹匪徒竟还要伤天害理地夸耀自己的罪行，说华沙已经只是一个地理名词。可是紧接着波兰的解放，英勇的人民立即投入了建设的热潮。新的首都从废墟上诞生了。
    两部影片给观众显示了一个鲜明的对比：法西斯主义意味着人民的物质和文化生活的摧残以至毁灭，社会主义意味着人民的物质和文化生活的创造和不断的提高。
    在“重建华沙”中，观众的眼睛随着在空中进行拍摄的电影机镜头的慢慢移动，可以看到一幅可怕的痛心的图画：建设了七百多年的华沙城大部分变成了断墙残壁，犹太区更烧成一片瓦砾；而这，正是法西斯匪徒们所追求的目的。他们把毁灭华沙的“工作”，有条理地分成“阶段”来“完成”，并且洋洋得意地向他们的“元首”报功。接着我们看到了这样一个镜头：当希特勒在国会宣布这个包含着多少血泪的消息时，会场上竟出现了许多鼓掌的手——比豺狼的爪子还要凶残千百倍的手。镜头随即又连接到鸟瞰下的废墟的惨象：一垛一垛只留下空洞的窗口的高墙。此时，影片的声带所传来的声音，不是什么哀伤调子的音乐，却就是法西斯国会里的那一片兴高采烈的掌声！这样简洁而又巧妙的艺术处理，已经使观众深刻地感受到艺术家所要说的话是什么，也相信这些话是对的。法西斯主义——资本主义发展到最后阶段，赤裸裸地暴露了自己本质的一种形态，对国外来说，就是侵略和毁灭他国人民的许多世纪以来的建设成果，就是破坏他们的和平生活，就是以千百万人的苦难和死亡，来作为一小撮野心家们的赏心乐事！
    但是，觉悟了的人民决不会容许他们这样横行。他们一时被资产阶级统治集团所出卖，被侵略者所奴役，但是在党的领导下，他们是会觉醒起来、行动起来的。他们不但能够赶走法西斯主义占领者，也有无穷无尽的智慧和力量能够把被摧毁的家园重建起来，而且建设得更加美好。
    “重建华沙”是对波兰人民克服巨大困难、进行大规模的国家建设工作的一首颂诗。它所歌颂的建设者就是华沙居民，就是这些普通的男女老少。从一锹一锹地清扫堆积如山的垃圾起，到一个一个地安装好门框和窗格，再到建成一条巨厦林立的壮丽的大街，影片细致地描写了人民的辛勤的劳动业绩。
    还不仅是“重建”起来。影片介绍了过去华沙的没有阳光、只有煤烟的劳动者的住所，现在漂亮的工人住宅却建立在都会的中心区。这些房子是属于人民的，再也不是地主房东们的剥削工具了。
    还不仅是修盖一些可以遮风蔽雨的建筑，而是要充分满足人民的文化需要、美感的需要，而是要保存和发扬民族文化传统。文艺复兴时代的建筑艺术杰作之一的华沙旧城，经过专家们的考证，按原样进行着修建工作，要求连门窗和屋内一切装饰，剥落的壁画和街灯，都丝毫不走样地恢复旧观，直到和古代名画上的一模一样。
    波兰在欧洲已获得了一个富于“建筑美”的新国家的名誉。
    而且建设的速度在全世界上是空前的。欧洲流传着“波兰式的速度”的美谈。
    这就是波兰人民对纳粹毁灭者的有力的答复。这就是在党的领导下，人民能够发挥出巨大力量和创造奇迹的活生生的例子。
    一边是劳动人民的自我牺牲的豪迈的创造性的劳动；一边是法西斯主义——垄断资本主义的好战者们的自私自利的抢劫和对人类千百年累积起来的文化精华的横暴摧残。这是多么强烈的一个对照！
    “最后阶段”和“重建华沙”还给观众鲜明的对比，那就是：法西斯主义就是人的道德的可耻的堕落，社会主义就是人的高尚品质的无限止的提高。法西斯主义不仅意味着物质文化的、而且是人的毁灭，是对生命的极端蔑视；社会主义不仅意味着物质文化的建设，而且是人的改造，是对人的尊重，对生命的尊重。
      “最后阶段”是故事片，但也是一个纪实的文献。外景的摄影地点就是奥斯威辛集中营遗址，连那些拥挤在一块儿的三层木架床都是原物。如果参看一下当时情况的文字记载，读者就会知道影片中许多虐待俘虏的场面和情节，都是以当时的真实生活为基础的。只是影片不可能把许多比目前所表现的更要黑暗无数倍的法西斯兽行，全部暴露出来。
    即使那些暴行只是被暗示和侧面提到，观众已经会震惊于纳粹匪徒和波兰投敌分子的人性的毁灭。他们彼此比赛杀人速度，夸耀着自己的杀人数量，津津有味地讨论“改进”杀人方式的计划。匪首们为了部下随便射杀女俘虏而奖给凶手假期。他们贪污俘虏的药品和食粮。他们一边虐待俘虏，一边听着唱片。他们把毒杀婴儿当做娱乐。他们劫夺走向毒气室的儿童手中的玩具。
    在已经改成纪念馆的奥斯威辛集中营里，今天还保存着德国匪徒来不及运走的俘虏的大量财物。他们一方面执行着可怕的希特勒的人口消灭计划，一方面进行着最大规模的盗窃，从每一个被俘者的身上剥下衣服来，摸出钱币来，敲下金牙来，剪下头发来，卸下假腿来……加以分类，运回国内，去变成战费，或者当作礼品送给自己的老婆和孩子……
    他们在烧人的烟囱底下，举行跳舞会。
    他们得意地欣赏自己的孩子居然能学他们的样，吆喝着也要杀人。
    他们之间又互相像狗一样地撕咬着。
    可是就在这些兽化了的人的旁边，手无寸铁的、失去自卫力的另一种人英勇地抗击着暴力，像冰雪中的松柏那样挺立着，保护着人民，捍卫着自己的同胞以及别国的劳动人民。他们宁愿自己死，却把能够挽救生命的药品让给不相识的难友。他们冒着生命的危险鼓舞群众抵抗敌人。他们无畏地在敌人的睡榻旁边展开地下活动。他们歌唱着走向刑场……
    这些光芒万丈的崇高人格同法西斯匪徒的卑怯可耻的生命，是多么鲜明的对比啊！
    在两部影片里表现了苏联政府和人民对波兰人民的慷慨无私的援助；表现了苏联的共产党员和红军战士的英勇行为。在“最后阶段”中，我们看到像叶娘这样的典型形象，在“重建华沙”中，我们看到一个参加解放华沙战役的苏联战士写在断墙上的签名。在华沙建设工作中，苏联人民又伸出了支援波兰的手。波兰人民从心底感谢苏联，感谢苏联人民。他们和世界人民一样把苏联看作自己的解放者和保卫者。
    社会主义制度以及社会主义制度下的人民，同法西斯制度以及法西斯制度下的帮凶者，是一个鲜明的对比。
    看了这些影片可以使人联想到当前的国际形势：一方面是社会主义国家、人民民主国家在和平建设事业方面的飞跃发展，和他们对缓和国际紧张局势的努力；一方面是美帝国主义者依旧对他们的一再破产的实力政策不肯死心，好战分子在太平洋上不断试验原子弹和氢弹，重复做着那陈旧的毁灭人类、毁灭文化的迷梦。这个对比同样也是鲜明的、强烈的。
