State-owned Shanghai Aquatic Products Company's Pair of Fishing Vessels
    Exceed Annual Fishing Target
    The No. 216-217 pair of fishing vessels belonging to the state-owned Shanghai Aquatic Products Company have exceeded their annual fishing target in six months and nine days.
    The fishing target accepted by the No. 216-217 fishing vessels this year was 1.8 million jin. This figure has increased by 33 percent compared with the fishing target of the fishing vessels last year, but by July 9, the actual catch had reached more than 1.95 million jin.
    In mid-April, dense schools of fish could not be found in the East China Sea fishing area. In order to find large schools of fish, the company leadership called on everyone to find new fishing grounds. The captains and crew of the No. 216-217 fishing vessels, while seizing the time to improve their fishing gear, took the initiative to inquire about fish fry from fishing sailing boats and opened up a rich new fishing ground between the East China Sea and the Yellow Sea. The first voyage caught more than 190,000 jin, creating the company's highest fishing record. Later, the reversing gear of this pair of fishing vessels failed several times during the voyage, and the ship's body often did not move ten minutes after departure. The captain and crew collectively studied how to not stop the engine when casting and hauling nets, using slow speed sailing to cast the nets, overcoming the difficulties. This pair of fishing vessels persisted in five voyages, catching more than 700,000 jin, exceeding the target every time.

    国营上海水产公司一对渔轮
    超额完成全年捕鱼任务
    国营上海水产公司所属二一六—二一七号一对渔轮已在六个月零九天内，超额完成了今年全年捕鱼任务。
    二一六—二一七号渔轮今年所接受的捕鱼任务是一百八十万斤。这个数字和该渔轮去年的捕鱼任务比较，已经增加了百分之三十三，但到七月九日止，实际捕鱼量已达到了一百九十五万余斤。
    四月中旬，东海渔区内找不到稠密的鱼群，公司领导上为了寻找大鱼群，号召大家另找新渔场。二一六—二一七号渔轮的船长和船员们，一面抓紧时间改进网具，一面主动向渔帆船打听鱼苗，在东海和黄海之间开辟了一个富饶的新渔场，头一次航海就捕捉到十九万余斤，创造了该公司捕鱼以来的最高纪录。以后，这对渔轮的倒顺机在航海途中几次失灵，往往在开船十分钟后船身仍不动，船长和船员集体研究出在收放网时不停车（机器），用慢速度行船来放网，克服了困难。这对渔轮坚持航海五次，捕鱼逾七十万斤，次次都超额完成任务。
