    Vietnamese-French Military Conference Held in Zhongyi
    Chief Representative of the Vietnam People's Army, Major General Van Tien Dung, Speaks
    [Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, 4th] Vietnam News Agency, North Vietnam, 4th: After discussing the qualifications and members of the French Expeditionary Forces Command delegation, the representatives of the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army and the representatives of the General Command of the French Expeditionary Forces reached an agreement: both parties would begin holding military conferences at Zhongyi, located 30 kilometers south of Thai Nguyen city on Highway No. 3, on the morning of July 4, 1954.
    The delegation of the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army, composed of five officers and led by Major General Van Tien Dung as the chief representative, has arrived at the conference site. The delegation of the General Command of the French Expeditionary Forces, composed of eight officers, is led by Colonel Lannuoy.
    [Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, 4th] Vietnam News Agency, North Vietnam, 4th: The military conference between the delegation of the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army and the delegation of the General Command of the French Union Forces in Indochina began on the morning of July 4th in Zhongyi, south of Thai Nguyen city. The full text of the speech by Major General Van Tien Dung, chief representative of the delegation of the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army, at the opening meeting is as follows:
    The Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference decided that representatives of the General Commands of both sides should meet in Geneva and locally to discuss issues related to implementing a ceasefire and armistice and restoring peace in Indochina. In Geneva, representatives of the General Commands of both sides have been holding meetings. Today, here in Vietnam, the first meeting between the representatives of the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army and the representatives of the General Command of the French Union Forces in Indochina is being held.
    Local meetings are beneficial and necessary if there is a sincere willingness to discuss specific measures to quickly end hostilities. Discussions held locally have a greater possibility of being specific and realistic.
    We can say that the current meeting of the representatives of the General Commands of both sides marks a step forward on the road to resolving the Indochina war through consultation.
    In the past eight years of patriotic struggle, under the wise leadership of President Ho Chi Minh, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and the Vietnam Workers' Party, the Vietnamese people and the People's Army have been fighting with an indomitable spirit to strive for the independence, unity, and democracy of their motherland, and to defend peace in Indochina and world peace. Consistent with the political方針(fāng zhēn) of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Vietnam People's Army warmly welcomes the Geneva Conference and considers it a victory for the people of Indochina, the French people, and peace-loving people around the world. The participation of the delegation of the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army in today's meeting once again proves the will of the people and government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to strive for independence, unity, democracy, and peace.
    The delegation of the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army is aware of the important task of this meeting. It will make its best efforts to not only enable the meeting to fulfill the agreements reached by both sides in Geneva, but also to put forward beneficial suggestions to the Geneva Conference, and to resolve locally those issues that both sides believe must be raised in order to quickly implement a ceasefire and armistice and restore peace in Indochina.
    We believe that the delegation of the General Command of the French Union Forces in Indochina also shares the same sincere desire to promote the early cessation of hostilities.
    For the benefit of the people of Indochina and the French people, we hope that the meeting will yield good results.

    越法双方军事会议在中亦举行
    越南人民军首席代表文进勇少将发言
    【新华社四日讯】越南通讯社北越四日讯：在讨论了法国远征军总司令部代表团的资格和成员以后，越南人民军总司令部的代表和法国远征军总司令部的代表取得协议：双方于一九五四年七月四日上午在位于第三号公路上的、太原城以南三十公里的中亦开始举行军事会议。
    由五名军官组成的，以文进勇少将为首席代表的越南人民军总司令部代表团已到达会议地点。由八名军官组成的法国远征军总司令部代表团是由兰努约上校率领的。
    【新华社四日讯】越南通讯社北越四日讯：越南人民军总司令部代表团和印度支那法兰西联邦部队总司令部代表团的军事会议已于七月四日上午在太原城以南的中亦开始举行。越南人民军总司令部代表团首席代表文进勇少将在开幕会议上的发言全文如下：
    日内瓦外长会议决定双方总司令部代表在日内瓦和在当地会晤，来讨论有关实现停火和停战并恢复印度支那和平问题。在日内瓦，双方总司令部的代表一直在举行会议。今天在越南这里，越南人民军总司令部代表和印度支那法兰西联邦部队总司令部代表的首次会议举行了。
    如果真诚地愿意讨论具体措施以迅速结束敌对行动的话，当地的会议是有益而且是必要的。在当地进行讨论，有更大的可能使讨论进行得具体而现实。
    我们可以说，目前双方总司令部代表的会议，标志着在通过协商来解决印度支那战争的道路上向前迈进了一步。
    越南人民和人民军在过去八年的爱国斗争中，在胡志明主席、越南民主共和国政府和越南劳动党的英明领导下，一直以不屈不挠的精神进行战斗，争取他们祖国的独立、统一和民主，并保卫印度支那和平和世界和平。和越南民主共和国政府的政治方针一致，越南人民军热烈欢迎日内瓦会议，并认为这是印度支那人民、法国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民的胜利。越南人民军总司令部代表团的参加今天的会议再一次证明了越南民主共和国的人民和政府争取独立、统一、民主和和平的意志。
  越南人民军总司令部代表团意识到这个会议的重要任务。它将尽最大努力来不仅使会议能够履行双方在日内瓦达成的协议，而且能向日内瓦会议提出有益的建议，并在当地解决那些双方认为要迅速实行停火和停战并恢复印度支那和平就必须提出的问题。
    我们相信印度支那法兰西联邦部队总司令部代表团也怀着同样的真诚愿望，要促使敌对行动早日停止。
    为了印度支那人民和法国人民的利益，我们希望会议将得到良好的结果。
