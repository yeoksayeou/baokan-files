Beijing Municipal Cultural Affairs Bureau, in coordination with the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions, convened the capital's professional performing arts groups and relevant units this year to study the past guidance work on employees' amateur artistic activities. It was decided that future guidance work should be carried out with a focus, so that each professional performing arts group and some factories and mines would establish long-term, fixed guidance relationships. The first batch of thirty-one instructors from six units, including the China Youth Art Theater, the Central Experimental Opera House, the Central Song and Dance Troupe, the Beijing People's Art Theater, the Beijing Film Actors Troupe, and the Central People's Broadcasting Station Storytelling Troupe, went to six factories and mines, including Chengzi Mine and Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, in March. The guidance period is tentatively set for two years. This selection focuses mainly on the larger factories and mines with a certain foundation in amateur artistic activities in the past. At the same time, the guidance business is determined based on the professional expertise of each professional art group and the original foundation of each factory and mine's amateur art activities. For example, the Central Song and Dance Troupe chose the Beijing People's Printing Factory, which has a better foundation in song and dance activities, for guidance.

The six professional performing arts groups participating in the guidance have included the guidance work for factories and mines in the annual work plan. Leaders and experts from these units also participated in this work. Dai Ailian, deputy head of the Central Song and Dance Troupe, personally went to the Beijing People's Printing Factory to guide the rehearsal of the factory's dance team. Wu Tian, deputy head of the Beijing Film Actors Troupe, and director Xi Qun, etc., went to Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant to check the situation of the guidance team rehearsing the drama "Sisters." Bai Fengming, head of the Central People's Broadcasting Station Storytelling Troupe, and actors participated in the guidance work at the Liulihe Cement Plant.

The guidance cadres who went to the factories and mines this time first emphasized the work of cultivating backbones, overcame some of the past "paternalistic" phenomena, and used various methods to attract the learning interest of employees. While training the backbone for basic training, attention was paid to the combination with performance activities. The Central Song and Dance Troupe's guidance to the Beijing People's Printing Factory's song team included basic training such as sight-singing, music theory, and vocal music, and also selected four songs as teaching materials for the performance program of the party. The programs rehearsed in the first stage of guidance in the six key factories and mines include: dramas "Red Flag," "Sisters," "People Strive to Go Higher"; folk dances, "Five Tiger Sticks," "Tea Picking and Butterfly Catching" and a number of storytelling works. Recently, the drama "Sisters," rehearsed by Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant under the guidance of the Beijing Film Actors Troupe, has been performed five times in the factory, and some employees have watched it three or four times and still want to see it. Everyone believes that their performance level has improved significantly compared to the past. When the China Youth Art Theater guided Chengzi Mine to perform the drama "The Technician is Here," although it was outdoors and encountered wind, the audience insisted on not leaving. The folk songs and dances performed by the Central Song and Dance Troupe to guide the Beijing People's Printing Factory were also welcomed by the employee audience.

The grass-roots leaders of the six key factories and mines also clarified the task of guidance work and included this work in the trade union's annual cultural and educational activities plan. The Party General Branch of the Liulihe Cement Plant warmly cares about the work, thinking and living conditions of the cadres who go to the factory for guidance. The Beijing People's Printing Factory Trade Union regards this work as one of the contents of the contract signed with the factory administration. The director of the steelmaking department of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant went to see the drama "Red Flag" rehearsed under guidance on Sunday and provided opinions on creating roles. The guidance cadres who went to the factory also took the initiative to strive for and rely on the leadership of the trade union to solve the phenomenon of mutual lack of communication and inconsistent steps. Some have further achieved the joint formulation of plans by both parties, mutual guarantees and inspection of the implementation of the plans. Some have also established the necessary meeting and contact systems.

The Beijing Film Actors Troupe and Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant formally signed a contract on the 6th of this month to ensure and consolidate the long-term fixed guidance relationship. The main contents of the contract are to determine the targets to be achieved in terms of rehearsing programs and cultivating backbones in the two years, to plan the general work steps, and to have specific guarantee conditions for both parties to fulfill the contract: the troupe maintains a certain guiding force; the trade union guarantees to do a good job in organizational work and provide convenient conditions for the guidance cadres to experience life, etc. Other units are also preparing to sign separately within the next month or two.

The Beijing Municipal Cultural Affairs Bureau and the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions are preparing to hold a guidance report performance within the year to further promote amateur art activities in various factories and mines in the city. (Nai Gang, Jia Lu)

Under the leadership of the Municipal Cultural Affairs Bureau, Shanghai's state-owned theaters and private professional theaters have gradually strengthened their performance activities for workers and their guidance to workers' amateur drama activities. From January to March of this year, they performed 288 shows, an average of 96 shows per month, an average monthly increase of almost double that of 1953. In terms of guidance work, in the past, two state-owned theaters and thirteen private professional theaters guided the drama activities of forty-five factories. Recently, seven state-owned theaters and twelve factories' amateur drama groups have established regular contacts to provide key guidance on performing repertoires. Workers expressed a warm welcome to the theater's factory guidance work.

A more effective method of guiding performance methods is the "Zhao Xiaolan teaches Zhao Xiaolan" method. This method is that the professional theater first performs a repertoire suitable for factory performances, and lets the workers participating in amateur drama activities watch it, and then rehearse the same repertoire after watching it. Before the rehearsal, professional drama workers explain the theme of the script. And professional actors and amateur actors who play the same role analyze the character's personality, thoughts and emotions together. For example, professional actors who play Zhao Xiaolan and amateur actors who play Zhao Xiaolan analyze and discuss together, and the result is that progress is very fast. In the work of guiding singing, the specific teaching experience is: start with the easy ones first, and then go deeper step by step. So that workers can learn one thing and then learn another, so that both the teacher and the learner have great confidence because of their remarkable achievements. (According to Jiefang Daily)

In order to strengthen the guidance and tutoring of employees' amateur artistic activities, the Propaganda Department of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China established a Mass Art Activity Guidance Committee and a Mass Amateur Art School. The school organized two amateur choirs with a high level of music and about 200 people participating. In order to cultivate musical backbones among workers, three singing cadre training classes were opened in Qiaokou, Wuchang, and Hanyang successively. Short-term amateur study classes in music, fine arts, and drama have also been opened successively in the cultural centers of Wuchang and Jiang'an, the First Textile Factory, and the Qiaokou Workers' Cultural Palace, with about 350 people participating in the study. This year, the Wuhan Municipal Cultural Affairs Bureau and the Wuhan Federation of Literary and Art Workers have transferred literary and artistic cadres to factories to carry out regular guidance work; the Central South People's Art Theater has also sent some cadres to factories. The Central South People's Art Theater also invited sixteen writers and professors to form a "literary advisory committee" to focus on contacting worker authors separately and concretely help them carry out literary and artistic studies and writing. In addition, some writers and professors have gone deep into factories to explain excellent literary and artistic works such as "Far Away from Moscow," "Dedicate Everything to the Party," and "An Ordinary Soldier," which has played a positive role in cultivating workers' reading of new literary and artistic works. Professional actors from units such as the Wuhan Chu Opera Troupe have also gone to guide workers' performances many times and established regular contact.

    北京、上海、武汉等地专业文艺团体
    对职工业余艺术活动进行经常的辅导
    北京市文化事业管理处今年起曾协同北京市总工会，邀集首都专业文艺团体和有关单位研究了过去对职工业余艺术活动的辅导工作情况，确定今后辅导工作应有重点的进行，使各专业文艺团体与部分厂矿分别建立长期固定的辅导关系。担任辅导工作的中国青年艺术剧院、中央实验歌剧院、中央歌舞团、北京人民艺术剧院、北京电影演员剧团、中央人民广播电台说唱团等六个单位第一批的三十一个辅导人员，已于三月间分别到城子矿、石景山钢铁厂等六个厂矿。辅导期暂定为两年。这一次选择的重点，主要的是过去业余艺术活动有一定基础的较大厂矿；同时，也根据各专业文艺团体的业务特长，和各厂矿业余艺术活动的原有基础来确定辅导的业务，如中央歌舞团选择较有歌舞活动基础的北京人民印刷厂进行辅导。
    参加辅导的六个专业文艺团体已将对厂矿的辅导工作，列入全年的工作计划。这些单位的领导和专家也参加了这一工作。中央歌舞团副团长戴爱莲亲自到北京人民印刷厂指导该厂舞蹈队的排练；北京电影演员剧团副团长吴天、导演洗群等均到石景山钢铁厂去检查辅导组排演话剧“姊妹俩”的情况；中央人民广播电台说唱团团长白凤鸣和演员一起在琉璃河水泥厂参加辅导工作。
    这次下到各厂矿的辅导干部，首先重视了培养骨干的工作，克服了过去某些“包办”的现象，并以各种方法吸引职工的学习兴趣。在培养骨干进行基本训练的同时，注意了和演出活动的结合。中央歌舞团辅导北京人民印刷厂的歌队，有视唱、乐理、声乐等基本训练，也选择四首歌曲为教唱的材料，作为参加晚会的演出节目。六个厂矿第一阶段辅导排练的节目有：话剧“红旗”、“姊妹俩”、“人往高处走”；民间舞蹈、“五虎棍”、“采茶扑蝶”和若干说唱作品。最近，石景山钢铁厂在北京电影演员剧团辅导下排练的话剧“姊妹俩”，已在该厂演出五次，有些职工看了三四次还想看。大家都认为他们的演出水平比过去有了显著的提高。中国青年艺术剧院辅导城子矿演出话剧“技术员来了”时，虽在露天又遇到刮风，观众仍坚持不走。中央歌舞团辅导北京人民印刷厂演出的民间歌舞，也获得职工观众的欢迎。
    六个重点厂矿的基层领导，也明确了辅导工作的任务，并将此项工作列入工会全年的文教活动计划中。琉璃河水泥厂党总支热诚地关心下厂辅导干部的工作、思想和生活情况；北京人民印刷厂工会把此项工作作为和该厂行政签订合同的内容之一；石景山钢铁厂炼铁部车间主任在星期天去看辅导排演的话剧“红旗”，并提供了创造角色的意见。下厂的辅导干部也主动争取和依靠工会的领导，解决了互不通气和步调不一致的现象。有的更进一步做到双方共同制订计划，相互保证和检查计划的执行。有的还建立了必要的会议和联系制度。
    北京电影演员剧团和石景山钢铁厂为了保证和巩固长期固定的辅导关系，已于本月六日正式签订合同。合同的主要内容是确定两年中排演节目和培养骨干方面所要达到的指标，规划出大体的工作步骤，并有双方履行合同的具体保证条件：剧团方面保持一定的辅导力量；工会方面保证做好组织工作和给予辅导干部体验生活的方便条件等。其他单位也准备在这一两个月内分别签订。
    北京市文化事业管理处和北京市总工会准备在年内举行一次辅导汇报演出，进一步推动全市各厂矿的业余艺术活动。（乃刚、贾鲁）
    上海市国营剧团和民间职业剧团在市文化事业管理局的领导下，逐渐加强了对工人的演出活动和对工人业余戏剧活动的辅导工作。今年一月至三月即演出了二百八十八场，平均每月演出九十六场，每月平均数比一九五三年几乎增加一倍。辅导工作方面，过去曾有两个国营剧团和十三个民间职业剧团，对四十五个工厂的戏剧活动进行了辅导。最近又有七个国营剧团和十二个工厂的业余戏剧组建立了经常的联系，对演出剧目作重点辅导。工人们对剧团的下厂辅导工作，表示热情的欢迎。
    辅导表演方法比较有成效的是：“赵小兰教赵小兰”的方法。这个方法是专业剧团先演出一个适合于工厂演出的剧目，让参加业余戏剧活动的工人看，看后也排演相同的剧目。排演之前，由专业戏剧工作者讲解剧本的主题思想。并由专业演员和演相同角色的业余演员在一起分析人物的性格、思想情感。例如，演赵小兰的专业演员和演赵小兰的业余演员在一起分析讨论，结果进展得很快。在辅导演唱工作中，具体的教唱经验是：先从容易的着手，然后再一步一步地深入。使工人学会了一样再学另一样，这样，教与学的人都因成绩显著而信心很高。　（据解放日报讯）
    中共武汉市委宣传部为了加强对职工业余艺术活动的指导和辅导，成立了群众艺术活动指导委员会和群众业余艺术学校。学校组织了两个有较高音乐水平、约两百人参加的业余合唱团。为了培养工人中音乐骨干，在礄口、武昌、汉阳先后开办了三个歌咏干部训练班。在武昌、江岸的文化馆，第一纱厂，礄口工人文化宫，也先后开办了音乐、美术、戏剧的短期业余学习班，约有三百五十人参加学习。武汉市文化事业管理局、武汉市文学艺术工作者联合会今年均抽调了文艺干部下厂去进行经常的辅导工作；中南人民艺术剧院也派了一部分干部下厂。中南人民艺术剧院并邀请十六位作家和教授组成“文学顾问会”，分别固定地重点联系工人作者，具体帮助他们进行文艺学习和写作。另外还有一些作家和教授，曾深入到工厂中为工人讲解“远离莫斯科的地方”、“把一切献给党”、“普通一兵”等优秀文艺作品，对培养工人阅读新文艺作品，起到了积极的作用。武汉楚剧团等单位的专业演员，也曾多次去辅导工人演出，并建立了经常的联系。
