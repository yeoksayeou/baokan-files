Overcoming Natural Disasters, Strengthening Field Operations
Crops Growing Well in Many Regions
[Report from this newspaper] Thanks to the efforts of the broad masses of peasants in actively fighting natural disasters and strengthening field management, crops are growing well in provinces such as Shaanxi, Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangxi, Hunan, and the Hetao Administrative Region of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.

Shaanxi Province: Cotton Growing Vigorously
In Shaanxi Province, cotton plants generally have grown to a height of 1.2 to 2 feet, with uniform plants and vigorous growth. In the Guanzhong Plain, more than 3 million mu of cotton have generally branched and are budding, with some flowering and producing bolls. In the irrigation areas of the Jinghui Canal, Weihui Canal, and Luohui Canal, cotton plants have about ten fruit branches and thirteen or fourteen flower buds, with flowering and boll formation occurring five or six days earlier than in previous years. Cotton plants on state-owned farms and agricultural production cooperatives in these areas are growing even more sturdily, with twelve or thirteen fruit branches, twenty flower buds, and more cotton bolls. It is estimated that the picking of new cotton can begin in late August.
In order to ensure the completion of cotton production increase tasks, cotton-growing peasants in the Guanzhong Plain and southern regions of Shaanxi Province completed seedling setting and replanting before and after the wheat harvest, and generally carried out two to three rounds of mid-cultivation and weeding. In Weinan Prefecture, a major cotton-producing area, more than 6,000 cadres at the provincial, prefectural, and county levels have gone deep into the countryside, on the one hand, planning the purchase of wheat and the collection of summer agricultural taxes, and on the other hand, leading peasants to strengthen cotton field management. More than 120 agricultural technology extension stations distributed throughout the province are also taking various forms to help cotton-growing peasants promote cotton pruning and disbudding techniques. State-owned canals have begun to release water for summer irrigation. Currently, the Jinghui Canal, Luohui Canal, Weihui Canal, and other irrigation areas have irrigated more than 400,000 mu of cotton fields. In addition to the existing 25,000 sprayers and dusters in the province, the central government's Ministry of Agriculture allocated 15,000 sprayers to various counties this year, which will be rented to peasants for use. 1,100 tons of "666" powder and other pesticides and machinery supplied by supply and marketing cooperatives to cotton-growing peasants have also been transported to various cotton-producing areas.

Zhejiang: Most Early Rice and Early-Mid Rice Turning Yellow
Thanks to the efforts of peasants in Zhejiang Province to overcome eight flood invasions and improve farming techniques, more than 13 million mu of early rice and early-mid rice are generally growing well, and a bumper harvest is in sight. Currently, most of the early rice in Wenzhou, Jinhua, Quzhou and other prefectures is nearing maturity, and some has even begun to be harvested. The 300,000 mu of early rice in Ruian County generally have strong stalks, plump ears, and full grains, and it is estimated that production will increase by 20% compared to last year. In a week, early rice harvesting can be fully started in all parts of the province. The early-mid rice in various places has also blossomed and eared, and can be harvested in a month. Since July, agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams in various places have successively formulated plans for rushing to harvest early rice, carried out labor, agricultural tools, and field area arrangements, and prepared to harvest and thresh carefully as soon as they are ripe, striving for every grain to return home.

Fujian: More Than 4 Million Mu of Early Rice Begin to be Harvested
More than 4 million mu of early rice in the Jiulong River, Jinjiang River, Minjiang River, and Tingjiang River basins in Fujian have begun to be harvested. The local Party committees and county Party committees in the summer harvest areas dispatched nearly a thousand cadres to the countryside to lead peasants to intensify the prevention of wind, rain, and insect disasters, improve harvesting methods, in order to improve the quality of the summer harvest and strive for the completion of the agricultural production increase plan. During the growth period of early rice in Fujian this year, the threat of natural disasters was very serious. There was a drought in the spring, and then nearly ten floods in the summer. Since the end of June, severe insect disasters have occurred in some areas, but under the full leadership and support of the Party and the government, peasants in various places have successively built tens of thousands of water conservancy projects, fought drought and prevented floods, and strengthened field management to eliminate pests. According to the current harvesting situation, most areas can still increase production compared to last year. Among them, 980,000 mu of early rice in Minhou Prefecture generally had a bumper harvest. According to preliminary estimates, 1.34 million mu of early rice in Jinjiang Prefecture can increase production by an average of more than 3% compared to last year. Agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams in various places have achieved significant increases in production: most of the 140 agricultural production cooperatives in Jinjiang Prefecture can increase production by 10% to 20%; the Red Star Agricultural Production Cooperative in Nanping County, which tested and introduced Nanteyi early rice in mountainous areas, harvested 708 catties per mu, setting a new record for early rice production in the local area. In Wenhe Township, Pinghe County, 33 mutual aid teams increased their rice income by 15,000 catties by improving harvesting technology alone.

Jiangxi Province is Harvesting Early Rice from South to North
More than 16 million mu of early rice in Jiangxi Province are being harvested from south to north in succession. Except for a small number of areas that have suffered from floods, most areas have had a better harvest. Early rice in Gannan Administrative Region can generally increase production by 7% compared to last year. Early rice in Ji'an and Fuzhou Prefectures and parts of Nanchang, Shangrao and other prefectures can generally increase production compared to last year. Early rice in many agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams in Ruijin, Xingguo, Xinfeng, Ganxian, Suichuan, Ji'an, Yiyang, Guixi and other counties has increased production by about 10% to 20% compared to last year. The early rice harvested by the Yu Yuanfa mutual aid team in Fugang Township, Guixi County, in early July increased by an average of more than 25% per mu compared to last year, far exceeding the harvest of local individual peasants. The Yu Yuanfa mutual aid team has expressed that it will take the lead in selling the dried new grain to the state after the early rice is harvested to support the country's industrial construction. This mutual aid team has received material rewards and spiritual commendation from the Guixi County People's Government.

Hunan: Rice and Miscellaneous Grains Flourishing in Hilly and Mountainous Areas
Rice and miscellaneous grain crops in the vast hilly and mountainous areas of Hunan Province are generally growing well. Early rice in the middle reaches of the Xiang River has generally matured, and some agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams have begun to harvest, with unit area yields mostly exceeding last year's; tens of millions of mu of mid-season rice are also green and lush, and some have begun to earing and flowering. In the western and southern mountainous areas, corn is more than one person tall, and some are tasseling and setting, and can be harvested in more than ten days; the vines and leaves of sweet potatoes are flourishing; soybeans, peas, broad beans and other bean crops are flowering and podding, and some are about to be harvested. In order to increase grain production to support the country's socialist industrialization, peasants in the vast hilly and mountainous areas of Hunan Province have made a series of efforts this year. Generally, close planting is implemented, attention is paid to selecting seeds and increasing fertilizer application. During the seedling growth period, peasants, driven by mutual aid and cooperation organizations, adopted methods such as diligent weeding, more fertilization, ditching and drainage, and reinforcing earth embankments to overcome four or five mountain flood disasters. Now, peasants in these areas are preparing to plant another season of rice or miscellaneous grain crops under the slogan of "using one mu of land as two mu of land," in order to over fulfill this year's grain production increase plan.

Hetao Area: Spring Wheat Grains are Full and a Bumper Harvest is in Sight
More than 1.296 million mu of spring wheat in the Hetao Administrative Region of the upper reaches of the Yellow River in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are growing vigorously, forecasting a bumper harvest. On the fertile Hetao Plain, wheat ears are fat and grains are full, and are close to maturity. Farmers of all ethnic groups in the Hetao area have expanded the wheat planting area by 184,000 mu this year compared to last year. According to the current wheat growth situation, the average yield per mu will increase by 15 to 25 catties compared to last year, and the total output will increase by more than 40 million to 60 million catties compared to last year. The early-sown wheat in Hangjinhou Banner, known as the "Granary South of the Desert," has now begun to be harvested. Party and government organs at all levels in the Hetao area led farmers of all ethnic groups and did a lot of work to strive for increased wheat production this year. Autumn plowing and autumn irrigation were carried out on wheat fields throughout the region last year. This year, the close planting area of wheat reached 74% of the wheat planting area, and the fertilizer application area of wheat fields also reached 70% to 80% of the wheat field area. The People's Government helped farmers of all ethnic groups add more than 2,000 walking plows, more than 400 draft animals and more than 1,000 other agricultural tools this year; it also helped solve problems such as seeds and feed, ensuring the smooth progress of production. One hundred large and small water conservancy projects were built throughout the region this spring, and timely irrigation was carried out. During summer weeding, general early and careful weeding was achieved. Most of the wheat in the region has been weeded twice. Many women also actively participated in the wheat weeding work this year. Now, farmers of all ethnic groups are nervously welcoming the wheat harvest work, preparing to harvest and thresh as soon as they are ripe, striving for every grain to return home. Many mutual aid and cooperation organizations have formulated plans to sell wheat to the state.

    战胜自然灾害，加强田间作业
    许多地区农作物生长良好
    【本报讯】在广大农民积极与自然灾害搏斗和加强田间作业的努力下，陕西、浙江、福建、江西、湖南等省和内蒙古自治区河套行政区的农作物生长良好。
    陕西省棉花生长旺盛
    陕西省各地棉花一般已长到一尺二寸到二尺高，植株整齐，生长旺盛。关中平原三百多万亩棉花已普遍分枝现蕾，部分正开花结铃。泾惠渠、渭惠渠、洛惠渠等灌溉区的棉株已有十个左右果枝和十三四个花蕾，开花结铃时间比往年早五六天。这些地区的国营农场和农业生产合作社的棉株长的更加茁壮，有十二三个果枝、二十个花蕾，结的棉铃也较多。据估计，八月下旬即可开始采摘新棉。
    为了保证完成棉花增产任务，陕西省关中平原和南部地区的植棉农民在麦收前后就结束定苗、补苗，并普遍中耕除草两次到三次。主要产棉区渭南专区已有省、专区、县等各级干部六千多人深入农村，一面计划收购小麦和征收夏季农业税，一面领导农民加强棉田管理。分布在全省各地的一百二十多个农业技术推广站，也正在采取各种形式帮助植棉农民推行棉花整枝打杈技术。各国营渠道已开始放水夏灌。目前仅泾惠渠、洛惠渠、渭惠渠等灌溉区已灌溉的棉田就有四十多万亩。全省除原有两万五千多架喷雾器、喷粉器外，今年各县又获得中央人民政府农业部拨给的喷雾器一万五千架，准备租借给农民使用。由供销合作社供应植棉农民的“六六六”药粉一千一百吨及其他药械，也已运到各产棉区。
    浙江早稻和早中稻大部黄熟
    浙江省由于农民战胜八次洪水侵袭和改进耕作技术，一千三百多万亩早稻和早中稻一般生长良好，丰收在望。目前温州、金华、衢州等专区的早稻大部已近黄熟，有些并已开始收割。瑞安县三十多万亩早稻普遍秆壮穗粗、谷粒饱满，估计可比去年增产两成。一个星期后，全省各地的早稻就可以全面开始收割。各地的早中稻也已扬花吐穗，过一个月也可以收割。七月以来，各地农业生产合作社和互助组纷纷制订抢收早稻的计划，进行劳力、农具、田亩等排队，准备随熟随割，细收细打，争取颗粒还家。
    福建四百多万亩早稻开始收割
    福建九龙江、晋江、闽江、汀江流域四百多万亩早稻已开始收割。夏收地区中共地委、县委抽调近千名干部下乡，领导农民加紧防止风、雨、虫灾害，改进收割方法，以提高夏收质量，争取农业增产计划的完成。今年福建早稻生长期间，自然灾害威胁很严重。春间逢旱，夏季又接连遭遇近十次洪水，六月底以来，若干地区又发生严重虫灾，但在党和政府全力领导与支持下，各地农民先后兴修了数万处水利，抗旱防涝，并加强田间管理，扑灭虫害。据目前收割情况来看，大部分地区仍能较去年增产。其中闽侯专区九十八万亩早稻普遍丰收。晋江专区一百三十四万亩早稻，据初步估计，平均可比去年增产百分之三以上。各地农业生产合作社和互助组增产情况显著：晋江专区一百四十个农业生产合作社，大部分都能增产一成至两成；南平县红星农业生产合作社，在山区试验引种的南特号早稻，一亩收到七百零八斤，创当地早稻产量新纪录。平和县文和乡三十三个互助组仅改进收割技术一项，便增加一万五千斤稻谷收入。
    江西省正从南到北收割早稻
    江西省一千六百多万亩早稻正从南到北陆续开镰收割。除少部分遭受水灾的地区外，大部地区多有较好的收成。赣南行政区早稻一般可比去年增产百分之七。吉安、抚州两专区以及南昌、上饶等专区的部分地区，早稻一般也可比去年增产。瑞金、兴国、信丰、赣县、遂川、吉安、弋阳、贵溪等县许多农业生产合作社和互助组的早稻，都比去年增产百分之十到百分之二十左右。贵溪县富港乡余元发互助组七月初收割的部分早稻，每亩平均比去年增产百分之二十五还多，大大地超过了当地单干农民的收成。余元发互助组已表示要在早稻收完后就带头把晒好的新谷卖给国家，支援国家工业建设。这个互助组受到了贵溪县人民政府的物质奖励和精神表扬。
    湖南丘陵区山区水稻杂粮两旺
    湖南省广大丘陵区和山区的水稻和杂粮作物一般生长良好。湘江中游地区的早稻已普遍黄熟，有些农业生产合作社和互助组已开镰收割，单位面积产量大多超过去年；数千万亩中稻也葱绿茁壮，有的已开始吐穗扬花。在西部和南部的山区，玉米长得一人多高，有的正在吐缨结实，十多天后即可收割；红薯的藤叶正在繁茂地伸展着；大豆、豌豆、?豆等豆类作物正在开花结荚，有的马上就要收割。为了增产粮食支援国家社会主义工业化，今年湖南省广大丘陵区和山区的农民作了一系列的努力。一般都实行密植，注意选种和增加施肥量。在农作物幼苗生长期间，农民们在互助合作组织带动下，采用勤锄草、多施肥、开沟排水、培固土坎等办法，战胜了四、五次山洪灾害。现在这些地区的农民正在“一亩田当两亩田用”的口号下，准备多种一季水稻或杂粮作物，以超额完成今年粮食增产的计划。
    河套区小麦籽粒饱满丰收在望
    内蒙古自治区黄河上游河套行政区一百二十九万六千多亩春小麦生长茁壮，预告丰收。在土质肥沃的河套平原上，小麦麦穗肥大，籽粒饱满，已近成熟。河套地区各族农民今年比去年扩大了小麦播种面积十八万四千亩。根据目前小麦生长情况估计，平均每亩将比去年增产十五斤到二十五斤，总产量将比去年增加四千多万斤到六千多万斤。向有“漠南谷仓”之称的杭锦后旗的早种小麦，现在已开始收割了。河套地区各级党政机关领导各族农民，今年为争取小麦增产做了许多工作。全区麦田在去年都进行了秋翻和秋浇，今年小麦密植面积达到小麦播种面积的百分之七十四，麦田施肥面积也达到麦田面积的百分之七十到八十。人民政府帮助各族农民今年增添了二千多张步犁、四百多头耕畜和其他农具一千多件；还帮助解决籽种、饲料等问题，保证了生产顺利进行。全区今春还兴修了大小水利工程一百项，适时地进行了灌溉。夏锄时，一般做到了早锄细锄，全区小麦大部分锄过二遍，今年很多妇女也积极参加了锄麦工作。现在，各族农民正紧张地迎接麦收工作，准备随熟随割，随拉随打，争取颗粒还家。许多互助合作组织已订出把小麦卖给国家的计划。
