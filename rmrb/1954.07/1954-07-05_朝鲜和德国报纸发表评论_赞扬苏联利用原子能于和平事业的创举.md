Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 4th: The "Rodong Sinmun" and "Democratic Korea," published in Pyongyang, released editorials on the 3rd, welcoming and congratulating the Soviet Union's great initiative in using atomic energy for peaceful purposes.

    The "Rodong Sinmun" editorial was titled "The Great Achievement of Soviet Science." The editorial stated: The news that the Soviet Union's first atomic power station to generate electricity has begun operation has aroused warm cheers and great hope from progressive humanity. This is another great victory for the Soviet people on the solemn road of communist construction, a great new achievement of Soviet science, and a major event in the contemporary field of science and technology. This initiative, which uses the greatest achievement of modern science for peaceful purposes, will powerfully promote the development of productive forces and make a huge contribution to the development of human society. It also marks the victory of the Soviet Union's peaceful policy, the victory of peace over aggression, and the victory of reason over barbarism.

    The editorial pointed out: The Soviet Union has consistently advocated that the great achievements of modern science should not be used to destroy civilization or to kill on a large scale, but should be used to meet peaceful needs and enhance the welfare of the people. Based on this noble principle, the Soviet Union has put forward a series of proposals for the unconditional prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons. However, the US-British aggressive bloc rejected these constructive proposals from the Soviet Union. The US imperialists use atomic and hydrogen weapons to threaten the people of Asia and other good people around the world, deepen international tensions, and intensify the arms race in order to seize huge profits. The actions of the United States and the fact that the Soviet Union has built an atomic industrial power station to supply electricity for peaceful purposes are a stark contrast.

    The "Democratic Korea" editorial pointed out: The completion of the Soviet Union's atomic energy industrial power station will not only rapidly strengthen the power of the Soviet Union's peaceful construction, but also create a new era for the cause of peace and enhancing human welfare. At the same time, it will give tremendous encouragement to the people of all countries in the peace and democracy camp who are engaged in peaceful construction. The Korean people heartily congratulate the new achievements of Soviet science, which serve human peace and welfare. Glory belongs to the Soviet Communist Party, the Soviet government, and the people who guaranteed this new achievement. The entire Korean people resolutely advocate that atomic energy must be used for peaceful purposes.

Xinhua News Agency, July 4th: According to a TASS report from Berlin on the 3rd: German newspapers commented on the recent communiqué issued by the Soviet Council of Ministers regarding the start of electricity generation by the Soviet Union's first atomic power station.

    The "Neues Deutschland" published an editorial entitled "Atomic Energy for Peaceful Purposes," saying that the start of electricity generation by the world's first atomic energy industrial power station built by the Soviet Union is a historic event. The "Neues Deutschland" emphasized that the use of atomic energy – the greatest scientific discovery of our time – has been used to benefit mankind. This fact once again demonstrates the peaceful aspirations of the Soviet government, which is committed to using modern science to benefit all mankind.

    The West German newspaper "Die Welt," in reporting on the start of electricity generation by the Soviet Union's atomic energy industrial power station, emphasized that the Soviet Union is superior to the United States.

### 朝鲜和德国报纸发表评论  赞扬苏联利用原子能于和平事业的创举

    朝鲜和德国报纸发表评论
    赞扬苏联利用原子能于和平事业的创举
    【新华社平壤四日电】平壤出版的“劳动新闻”和“民主朝鲜报”在三日发表社论，欢迎和祝贺苏联把原子能用于和平事业的伟大创举。
    “劳动新闻”社论的题目是“苏联科学的伟大成就”。社论说：苏联用原子能发电的第一个电力站开始发电的消息，引起进步人类的热烈欢呼和巨大希望。这是苏联人民在庄严的共产主义建设道路上取得的又一个伟大胜利，是苏联科学伟大的新成果，也是当代科学技术界的重大事件。这个把现代科学最伟大的成就用于和平事业的创举，将有力地促进生产力的发展，对人类社会的发展作出巨大的贡献。它并且标志着苏联和平政策的胜利，和平对侵略的胜利，理性对野蛮的胜利。
    社论指出：苏联一贯主张不把现代科学的伟大成就用来破坏文明，不用来大规模杀人，而用来满足和平的需要，增进人民的福利。从这种崇高的原则出发，苏联曾提出了一系列的关于无条件禁用原子武器和氢武器的建议。但是美英侵略集团却拒绝了苏联这些建设性的建议。美帝国主义者用原子武器和氢武器来威胁亚洲人民和其他各国的善良人民，加深国际紧张局势，加紧军备竞赛，以攫取巨额的利润。美国的行为和苏联建成原子能工业电力站为和平事业供应电力的事实，正好成为鲜明的对照。
      “民主朝鲜报”社论指出：苏联原子能工业电力站的建成，不但会迅速加强苏联和平建设的力量，而且为和平和增进人类福利的事业创造了新纪元。同时，它将给予正从事和平建设的和平民主阵营的各国人民以莫大的鼓舞。朝鲜人民衷心祝贺为人类和平和福利服务的苏联科学的新成就。光荣属于保证获得这一新成就的苏联共产党，苏联政府和人民。全朝鲜人民坚决主张必须把原子能用于和平的目的。
    【新华社四日讯】据塔斯社柏林三日讯：德国的报纸评论苏联部长会议最近发表的关于苏联第一个原子电力站开始发电的公报。
      “新德意志报”以“用于和平目的的原子能”为题发表社论说，苏联所建造的世界上第一个原子能工业电力站开始发电，是具有历史意义的事情。“新德意志报”强调指出，我们时代中最伟大的科学发现——原子能的使用——已被用来为人类造福了。这一事实再一次表明，致力于把近代科学用来为全人类造福的苏联政府的和平愿望。
    西德报纸“世界报”在报道苏联原子能工业电力站开始发电时着重指出，苏联比美国优越。
