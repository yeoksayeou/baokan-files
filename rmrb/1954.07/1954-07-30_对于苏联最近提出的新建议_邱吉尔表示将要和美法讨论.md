Xinhua News Agency, London, July 29th: TASS, London, July 28th—On July 27th, some British Labour Party members in the House of Commons requested that Prime Minister Churchill take advantage of the improved international situation resulting from the success of the Geneva Conference to propose a meeting of the heads of the three major powers to resolve other international issues. However, Churchill did not give any positive answer to this question.

Labour Party member Bevan suggested that the government respond to the Soviet Union's note on holding a conference on European security issues before the House of Commons' summer recess. Churchill replied: "I cannot guarantee that all the complex situations can be clarified in the next few days. The recent proposals put forward by the Soviet government raise some important questions related to the conference, all of which must be discussed between the three allies."

    对于苏联最近提出的新建议
    邱吉尔表示将要和美法讨论
    【新华社二十九日讯】塔斯社伦敦二十八日讯：七月二十七日，英国一些工党议员在下院要求邱吉尔首相利用因日内瓦会议的成功而使国际局势得到了改善的这一机会，提出举行三大国元首会谈的建议，以解决其他国际问题。但是，邱吉尔对这个问题没有给予任何肯定的回答。
    工党议员比万建议政府在下院夏季休会以前，答复苏联提出的关于就欧洲安全问题举行一次会议的照会。邱吉尔回答说：“我不能保证在今后数天之内一切的复杂形势都能得到澄清。苏联政府最近提出的建议提出了和会议有关的一些重要问题，所有这些问题都必需在三个盟国之间进行商讨。”
