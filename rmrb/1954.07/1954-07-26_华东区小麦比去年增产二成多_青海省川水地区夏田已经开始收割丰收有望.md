East China's wheat harvest was completed successively by the end of June. The main wheat-producing areas in Shandong, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces, accounting for more than 90% of the region's wheat acreage, all achieved a bumper harvest. The total wheat output of the region exceeded this year's planned output by 4.7%, an increase of more than 22% compared to 1953, and an increase of more than 14% compared to the bumper wheat harvest of 1952.

The state-run mechanized farms also generally increased their wheat production this year, with a total output increase of more than 80% compared to last year. The wheat harvest of many agricultural production cooperatives mostly saw increases. For example, the 250 mu of wheat fields in the Guo Zongbin Agricultural Production Cooperative in Zhaotian Township, Huimin County, Shandong, averaged 240 jin per mu, an increase of 33% per mu compared to last year, and an increase of 84% per mu compared to individual farmers in the area, exceeding the average output of Tianjia Village in the area by 64%, greatly demonstrating the superiority of agricultural production cooperatives.

The total wheat output in East China this year was able to increase significantly because, in addition to the expansion of the planting area by more than 3.5 million mu, there were significant improvements in cultivation techniques, such as changing from cluster sowing to row sowing, using improved varieties, and adopting appropriate close planting. In particular, on the basis of the vigorous development of mutual aid and cooperation in the vast rural areas, a widespread movement was launched to tap production potential and strive for a bumper wheat harvest, and a strong struggle was waged against various natural disasters. Last year, some areas in Shandong, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces suffered relatively severe drought disasters during the wheat sowing season. Farmers used methods such as carrying water to plant one seedling at a time to fight the drought and rush planting. This year, in April and May, many wheat fields suffered severe hail and waterlogging disasters. However, under the active leadership of local Party and government and the leading promotion of mutual aid and cooperation organizations, the broad masses of farmers were united to overcome various difficulties and finally achieved increased production. After celebrating the bumper harvest, the farmers in various places sold the newly harvested wheat to the state and purchased production materials to expand reproduction and strive for another bumper harvest in the autumn.

Summer crops in most of the river valley areas of Minhe, Ledu, Xunhua, Guide, Huangzhong, Huzhu, and Hualong counties in Qinghai Province are about to be harvested. Barley and highland barley in twelve townships in the first, second, third, fifth, and sixth districts of Minhe, Laoya Township in Ledu, and the areas along the Yellow River in Xunhua began to be harvested at the end of June or the beginning of July. Judging from the current crop situation, most areas are expected to increase production.

In order to achieve rapid harvesting and threshing, and to avoid losses from wind and rain, all localities have generally grasped the central link of strengthening leadership over mutual aid and cooperation organizations. In addition to convening meetings of the heads of the six agricultural production cooperatives in the county and the cadres stationed in the cooperatives to help each cooperative preliminarily formulate harvesting plans and study distribution ratios and distribution methods, Ledu County also instructed each district and township to conscientiously hold meetings of mutual aid team leaders at the township level to help mutual aid teams formulate plans and do a good job in harvesting work, so as to further consolidate and improve the mutual aid teams, demonstrate to the farmers, and promote the continued development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement. Xunhua Salar Autonomous County held a training class for mutual aid team leaders, absorbing 70 mutual aid team leaders from the Yellow River coast and other areas where harvesting began earlier, focusing on studying how to arrange work within the mutual aid team during harvesting, rationally organize and use manpower and animal power, and harvesting, seed selection, pest control, and other technologies to improve the leadership level of mutual aid team leaders.

All localities have also paid attention to solving the difficulties of agricultural tools and the living difficulties of a few farmers. For example, the Xunhua Salar Autonomous County Cooperative Federation has supplied more than 2,300 pieces of summer harvest agricultural tools to farmers of all ethnic groups, and the supply and marketing cooperatives in each district have also organized mobile supply teams to go to the countryside. The Minhe County Federation has prepared 2,000 sickles, 3,000 iron shovels, 10,000 wooden forks, 4,000 iron ploughshares, and more than 1,600 other agricultural tools. The Ledu County Federation has also prepared more than 10,600 various summer harvest agricultural tools, and plans to supply 60 head of draught animals to farmers of all ethnic groups before and after the summer harvest. The difficulties of a few farmers lacking food and firewood during the summer harvest have also been initially resolved under the active leadership of the Party and government in various localities, on the basis of being organized, through mutual assistance and mutual borrowing.

### 华东区小麦比去年增产二成多  青海省川水地区夏田已经开始收割丰收有望

    华东区小麦比去年增产二成多
    青海省川水地区夏田已经开始收割丰收有望
    华东各省小麦已于六月底前先后收割完毕。占全区小麦面积百分之九十以上的山东、安徽、江苏三省主要产麦区均获得了丰收，全区小麦总产量超过今年计划产量的百分之四点七，比一九五三年增产二成二以上，比一九五二年的小麦大丰收也增产了一成四以上。
    绝大部分的国营机械农场的小麦今年也普遍增产，总产量可比去年增加百分之八十以上。许多农业生产合作社的小麦收成大都得到增产，如山东惠民县昭田乡郭宗彬农业生产合作社二百五十亩麦田，平均产量达二百四十斤，比去年每亩增产百分之三十三，比当地的单干农户每亩增产百分之八十四，超过当地田家村平均产量百分之六十四，大大地显示了农业生产合作社的优越性。
    今年华东地区小麦总产量所以能够大大增加，除播种面积扩大了三百五十余万亩外，耕作技术有很大的改进，如改墩播为条播，采用良种，采用适当密植等等；特别是广大农村在互助合作蓬勃发展的基础上，广泛地开展了挖掘生产潜力争取小麦丰收运动，并向各种自然灾害进行了坚强的斗争。去年山东、安徽、江苏等省部分地区，正当小麦播种季节，遭到了较严重的干旱灾害，农民们用挑水点种等办法进行了抗旱抢种，今年四、五月间又有不少麦田遭到了严重的冰雹和雨涝灾害，但在各地党政积极领导和互助合作组织的带头推动下，团结了广大农民克服了各种困难，终于获得了增产。各地农民在喜庆丰收之后，纷纷把新收小麦出售给国家，并添购生产资料扩大再生产，争取秋季再丰收。

    青海省民和、乐都、循化、贵德及湟中、互助、化隆等地大部川水地区的夏季作物，即将收割。民和一、二、三、五、六区十二个乡，乐都老鸦乡及循化沿黄河一带的大麦、青稞，已于六月底或七月上旬开始搭镰。从目前庄稼情况来看，绝大多数地区可望增产。
    为了作到快收快碾，随收随碾，避免遭受风吹、雨打等损失，各地一般都抓住了加强对互助合作组织的领导这一中心环节。乐都县除召集全县六个农业生产合作社的社长、住社干部等开会，帮助各社初步制定收割计划，研究分配比例和分配方法外，并责成各区、乡，以乡为单位认真开好互助组长会议，帮助互助组制定计划，作好收割工作，使互助组进一步巩固和提高，并示范农民，促进互助合作运动的继续发展。循化县撒拉族自治区举办了一期互助组长训练班，吸收黄河沿岸等收割开始较早地区的七十名互助组长参加，着重研究了收割中互助组内如何安排工作，合理组织和使用人畜力，及收割、选种、防虫等技术，提高互助组长领导水平。
    各地也注意了解决农具及少数农民的生活困难。如循化县撒拉族自治区合作社联合社已向各族农民供应夏收农具两千三百多件，各区供销合作社也组织流动供应小组下乡。民和县联社已准备好了镰刀二千张、铁锨三千张、木杈一万把、铁铧四千页及其他农具一千六百多件。乐都县联社也备就各种夏收农具一万零六百多件，更计划在夏收前后，给各族农民供应耕畜六十头。少数农民夏收中缺乏口粮、烧柴等困难，也在各地党、政的积极领导下，在组织起来的基础上，以进行互助互借等办法得到了初步解决。
