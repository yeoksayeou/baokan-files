    Strive for Timeliness in News
    Readers often use the banquet host's complaint about late guests to complain about the outdated news in newspapers: "This news is almost history, what's the point of reading it!" Unfortunately, this kind of "news" is not uncommon in our newspapers. Some of our comrades don't seem to know that this kind of outdated news is not welcomed by readers. They often use this kind of stuff to fill the reader's appetite.
    News is not only a weapon for conducting widespread and regular propaganda and education among the masses, but also the fastest weapon for reflecting reality and guiding practice. Everyone knows that news is a report of recently occurred facts. This definition points out that the biggest characteristic of news is its timeliness, and that only recently occurred facts are news, otherwise it is old news. This clearly shows that timeliness is a basic element of news.
    Think about it: if a meeting has already been held, and there has been new progress and situations in the work, what is the point of the newspaper publishing the news of the meeting? Introducing experiences and criticizing shortcomings, why not seize the opportunity? It must be clearly recognized that the timeliness of news is not just a requirement for a certain type of news, but a requirement for all news. Any news that loses its timeliness will reduce its political significance, and sometimes even become worthless.
    Soviet newspapers attach great importance to the timeliness of news. They often educate reporters and correspondents to strictly abide by the requirements of news timeliness.
    Of course, it is difficult to immediately require the news published in our newspapers to be as fast as Soviet newspapers, that can only be our goal. Moreover, reports of some important meetings or major issues must choose the timing of publication to make them more conducive to the work, and cannot be required to be published immediately across the board. Striving for timeliness must also be completely truthful, and in-depth interviews cannot be omitted in order to rush time, resulting in untrue or incomplete reports. However, many of our news items are not timely, not because of the above reasons, but because of some man-made factors, so that news that should have been published earlier is published late. Not to mention the distant past, recently the Guangxi Daily editorial department's own review criticized some outdated news published in the Guangxi Daily in May.
    In April and May, several provincial conferences were held in Nanning, where Guangxi Daily is located. Except for the opening and closing news of the First Industrial Labor Model Conference being relatively timely, the news of other conferences was published many days later. For example, the news of the provincial traffic safety campaign conference held in late April was not published until May 16. The news said that the meeting decided to "take May and June as the traffic safety production campaign month," which shows that this was a matter that was both timely and related to the broad masses, but some readers in remote areas of the province could only read it when May was almost over. The news of the provincial Public Security Department holding a celebration and model representative meeting published on May 5 was also published more than ten days later. This news was also completely possible and should have been published earlier.
    It is not uncommon for news to not specify the time, or to vaguely use "the previous stage", "currently", or "recently" instead of specific times. In the news of the Guangxi Provincial Public Security Department holding a celebration and model representative meeting mentioned earlier, and the news of "Shilong held production materials exchange meetings in various places" published in the newspaper on May 13, readers could not figure out when these two meetings were held from beginning to end. The description of time in the news of "Fangcheng Star Anise Cinnamon Cassia entering the market in large quantities" on May 15 is:
  "Currently, Fangcheng's star anise and cinnamon cassia are in the peak harvest season..., currently... Fangcheng Trading Company has organized forces... to purchase in large quantities..., as of now, a total of ...jin of cinnamon cassia has been received." Strictly speaking, not writing a clear time in the news like this is essentially a manifestation of not paying attention to the timeliness of news.
    There are more than just these news items lacking timeliness, but these are enough to draw our attention to this issue.
    The main reason for allowing outdated news to appear in the newspaper is that the editorial department did not recognize the importance of news timeliness when organizing and publishing news, and therefore did not take the necessary improvement measures. This situation must be changed.
    It should be recognized that it is entirely possible to gradually overcome the problem of untimely news, but we must also see its difficulties. The main difficulty is that some reporters and correspondents have thoughts of underestimating news, seeking perfection and seeking big things, and are not enthusiastic about writing news. Sometimes when writing news, they do not strive to ensure the timeliness of the news. Secondly, due to insufficient political level, policy level, and writing skills, it is not possible to promptly discover problems, promptly write, and promptly write everything. Therefore, to strengthen the timeliness of news and gradually eliminate outdated news, the editorial department needs to pay attention to strengthening the education of reporters and correspondents from the above two aspects.

### 争取新闻不失时效

    争取新闻不失时效
    读者常常用宴会主人埋怨客人迟到的心情，来埋怨报纸上的失去时效的新闻：“这些新闻都快变成历史了，还有什么看头！”可惜的是，这类“新闻”在我们的报纸上为数并不少。我们有些同志好像并不知道，这种失去时效的新闻，是不为读者欢迎的。他们还常常用这种东西，来填塞读者的胃口。
    新闻不仅是广泛地经常地对群众进行宣传教育的武器，而且是最迅速地反映实际与指导实际的武器。大家都知道：新闻是新近发生的事实的报道。这个定义指出了新闻的最大特性就是它的时间性，指出了只有新近发生的事实才是新闻，否则就是旧闻。这就明确地说明了，时间性乃是新闻的一个基本要素。
    想一想看：如果一个会议已经开完，工作中已经有了新的进展和情况，报纸还有什么必要发表这个会议的消息？介绍经验、批评缺点，又何尝不要抓住火候？必须明确认识：新闻的时间性并不只是对某一类新闻的要求，而是对所有新闻的要求。任何新闻如果失去了时间性，就会减低它的政治意义，有时甚至会变得毫无价值。
    苏联报纸非常重视新闻的时间性。他们经常教育记者和通讯员，要严格遵守新闻时间性的要求。
    当然，马上要求我们报纸登的新闻，都能像苏联报纸一样的迅速，是有困难的，那还只能是我们努力的目标。而且，有些重要会议或重大问题的报道，必须选择发表的时机，使其更有利于工作，不能一律要求立即发表。争取时效也还必须作到完全真实，不能因为抢时间就不深入采访，以致报道失实或不完全真实。但是，我们有许多新闻所以不及时，并不是由于上述的原因，而是出于一些人为的因素，使应该早见报的新闻也是迟迟发表。远的不说，最近广西日报编辑部自己的检讨中，就对五月份广西日报发表的一些失去时效的新闻作了批评。
    四、五月份在广西日报所在地的南宁，开了几个全省性的会议。除了第一届工业劳动模范大会的开幕、闭幕的新闻比较及时外，其他一些会议的新闻都是隔了许多天才发表。例如四月下旬召开的全省交通安全运动会议的新闻，到五月十六日才见报。新闻中说这个会议决定“以五、六两月为交通安全生产运动月”，可见这是一件既有时间性而又和广大群众有关的事情，但是本省某些远地的读者，却只能在五月快过去时读到它。五月五日发表的省公安厅召开庆功表模代表会议的新闻，也是相隔了十多天才发表，这个新闻也完全可能而且应该早日见报的。
    新闻中不写明时间，或只含糊地用“前一阶段”、“目前”、“最近”来代替具体时间的并不少。前面所举的广西省公安厅召开庆功表模代表会议的新闻和该报五月十三日刊登的“石龙各地举办生产资料交流会”的新闻，读者从头读到尾都弄不清楚这两个会是在什么时候开的。五月十五日“防城八角桂通大量上市”的新闻，在时间上的叙述是：
  “目前，防城的八角、桂通正是收获旺季……，目前……防城贸易公司已组织力量……大量收购……，截至目前止，共收到桂通……斤”。严格地说，像这样在新闻内不写出明确的时间，实质上也是一种不重视新闻时间性的表现。
    缺乏时间性的新闻并不止这些，但就是这些，已足够引起我们对这个问题的重视了。
    让失去时间性的新闻在报纸上出现，最主要的原因，是在于编辑部组织和编发新闻时，没有认识到新闻时间性的重要，因而也没有采取必要的改进措施。这种情况必须加以改变。
    应该认识，逐步克服新闻不及时的毛病是完全可能的，但也要看到它的困难。这个困难主要是，有些记者、通讯员存在着轻视新闻、求全求大的思想，不热心于写新闻。有时写新闻，也不努力争取新闻的时间性。其次，便是限于政治水平、政策水平和采写能力的不足，还不可能一下都作到及时发现问题、及时采写、及时写出。因而，要加强新闻的时间性，逐渐淘汰失去时效的新闻，这就需要编辑部注意从上述两方面，加强对记者、通讯员的教育。　（天西）
