Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai Provinces are Gradually Carrying Out Activities to Publicize and Discuss the Draft Constitution
Large Numbers of Reporters and Propagandists Go Deep into Rural Areas and Streets to Work

[By Our Newspaper] Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai provinces are gradually carrying out publicity and discussion activities for the draft constitution.

In Shaanxi Province, the activities of publicizing and discussing the draft constitution have been widely launched in rural areas. All special districts and counties (cities) have concentrated on training a large number of reporters and propagandists, and have universally convened representative meetings of propagandists, making full preparations for publicizing to the masses and leading the masses to discuss the draft constitution. At the first meetings of the first sessions of the People's Congresses, Party Representative Meetings, and three-level cadre meetings held in various counties (cities), the draft constitution was also fully discussed. Each county also dispatched a large number of cadres to the countryside to cooperate with grain requisitioning and purchasing work, publicizing to the peasant masses and organizing the masses to discuss the draft constitution. Many counties and cities mobilized middle school and primary school teachers returning home for the summer vacation to carry out publicity activities during the summer vacation. Now these publicity forces have successively arrived in rural areas to launch publicity. More than 1,100 reporters and propagandists in various counties of the Hanzhong Special District have gone deep into rural areas, using reading groups, mutual aid teams, and agricultural cooperatives as activity centers, and gradually launching publicity to the broad masses. Rural reading groups have begun to organize peasants to conduct discussions. Reporters and propagandists from Yan'an, Fu County, Ganquan, and Wuqi counties in the Yan'an Special District have gone to rural areas and streets to carry out publicity and are organizing the masses to conduct discussions.

In Gansu Province, as of now, more than 70 counties, cities, and autonomous regions have launched publicity activities for the draft constitution. In order to make the draft constitution known to every household and deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, all the publicity forces and publicity tools that can be mobilized in various places have been mobilized. Various newspapers in the province, local blackboards, wired broadcasting stations, loudspeakers, slide projectors, and reading groups all take the publicity of materials related to the draft constitution as their main content; the political courses in workers' spare-time schools and people's schools also mainly focus on the draft constitution. The masses have a high enthusiasm for studying and discussing the draft constitution. In Linxia City, the number of people in some reading groups has more than doubled compared to the past, and the masses ask the readers to read materials related to the draft constitution to them whenever they have time; many people have voluntarily purchased separate editions of the draft constitution. In publicity, all localities pay attention to taking care of the production time of the masses. The principle of publicizing the draft constitution in rural areas is to combine it with production, not to delay production, and thus promote production. The way to combine it is that all departments involved in rural work, when holding other meetings or carrying out other work, should combine it with constitutional publicity as much as possible, using the draft constitution as a driving force; in terms of publicity methods, use production gaps and adopt more small-scale chat methods. To this end, the CPC Dingxi Prefectural Committee specifically transferred a group of cadres to various counties to provide specific assistance. Many propagandists have gone deep into mutual aid teams to conduct field publicity. Counties such as Yumen and Shandan, and the Tianzhu Tibetan Autonomous Region, also used opportunities such as markets or horse racing to explain the draft constitution to the masses.

In Ningxia Province, the work of publicizing and organizing discussions on the draft constitution among the masses has been carried out throughout the province. In the fourth district of Yinchuan City, as of July 5, a total of more than 2,100 people had heard the propagandists' publicity. In Beita Township alone, 24 meetings of various kinds were held before July 4 to publicize the draft constitution to the masses. Each district in Helan County fully launched the work of studying, publicizing, and discussing the draft constitution on June 22. Each township convened meetings of people's representatives, Party members, League members, propagandists, reading group leaders, activists, etc., to mobilize and arrange the publicity of the draft constitution. In addition to organizing six publicity groups, Tongji Township in the Second District also formed an inspection and roving reporting group composed of township instructors to publicize to the masses. Before going to the villages to report, they all studied the reporting outline based on the publicity materials and combined with the actual situation in the local area. After the publicity groups publicized for three days, they all returned to the township to report on the situation and exchange experiences.

In Qinghai Province, the office cadres of the Yushu, Guoluo, Huangnan, Haibei, and Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Regions and the Haixi Mongolian, Tibetan, and Kazak Autonomous Region in the pastoral areas have now begun the publicity and discussion of the draft constitution. The Party committees at all levels in the pastoral areas attach great importance to the publicity and discussion of the draft constitution, and cadres of all ethnic groups are very enthusiastic and serious in the discussions. Tibetan and Han cadres in the Guoluo Tibetan Autonomous Region began discussions on June 21. Before the start of the discussion, Ma Wanli, secretary of the CPC Guoluo Prefectural Committee, made a mobilization report on the great significance of discussing the draft constitution to all cadres at the special district level. In order to help minority cadres earnestly discuss the draft constitution, the Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Region formed the minority cadres of various organs of the autonomous region into a study group, led by a special person to help read documents and conduct discussions. The Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Region decided that at the beginning of the discussion of each chapter, the secretary of the CPC Prefectural Committee or the responsible cadre would make a report or explanation.

    大批报告员宣传员深入农村和街道去工作
    【本报讯】陕西、甘肃、宁夏、青海等省正逐步开展宪法草案的宣传讨论活动。
    陕西省宣传、讨论宪法草案的活动已在农村广泛展开。各专区、县（市）都曾集中训练了大批报告员、宣传员，普遍召开了宣传员代表会议，为向群众宣传并领导群众讨论宪法草案作了充分准备。在各县（市）召开的首届人民代表大会第一次会议上、党代表会上及三级干部会上，也都对宪法草案进行了充分的讨论。各县并抽出大批干部下乡，配合征粮购粮工作，向农民群众宣传和组织群众讨论宪法草案。许多县、市动员了暑期回家的中学生和小学教师利用暑期进行宣传活动。现在这些宣传力量已陆续到达农村展开宣传。汉中专区各县报告员和宣传员一千一百多人，已深入到农村，以读报组、互助组和农业社为活动中心，逐步向广大群众展开宣传。农村读报组已开始组织农民进行讨论。延安专区的延安、鄜县、甘泉、吴旗四县的报告员和宣传员已到农村和街道进行宣传，并正组织群众进行讨论。
    甘肃省截至目前为止，已有七十多个县、市、自治区展开了宪法草案的宣传活动。为了使宪法草案家喻户晓、深入人心，各地凡是能够动员的宣传力量和宣传工具都被动员起来。省内各种报纸、各地黑板报、有线广播站、广播筒、幻灯片、读报组都以宣传有关宪法草案的材料为主要内容；职工业余学校、民校的政治课也大都以宪法草案为主要内容。群众学习、讨论宪法草案的情绪很高。临夏市有些读报组的人数比原先增加了一倍多，群众一有空就要求读报员给大家念有关宪法草案的材料；很多群众自动购买了宪法草案单行本。在宣传中，各地都注意照顾群众的生产时间。在农村宣传宪法草案的原则是结合生产、不误生产从而推动生产。结合的办法是农村工作的各个部门，在开其他会议或者进行其他工作时，都尽可能结合宪法宣传，以宪法草案作为推动力量；在宣传方法上利用生产空隙，多采取小型漫谈方式。为此，中共定西地委会曾专门抽调了一批干部，到各县进行具体的帮助。很多宣传员都深入到互助组进行田间宣传。玉门、山丹等县和天祝藏族自治区还利用集市或赛马会等机会向群众讲解宪法草案。
    宁夏省在群众中宣传和组织讨论宪法草案的工作，已经在全省范围内开展。银川市第四区全区截至七月五日为止，听过宣传员宣传的群众共有两千一百多人。仅北塔乡一乡，在七月四日前就召开了各种会议二十四次向群众宣传宪法草案。贺兰县各区在六月二十二日全面展开宪法草案的学习、宣传和讨论工作。各乡都召开了人民代表大会，党员、团员、宣传员、读报组长、积极分子等会议，动员和布置宪法草案的宣传。二区通济乡除已组织了六个宣传小组外，还由乡指导员等组成一个检查和巡回报告小组，向群众进行宣传。他们在下村报告前，都根据宣传材料结合当地实际情况，研究报告提纲。各宣传小组宣传了三天后，都回到乡上汇报情况，交流经验。
    青海省牧业区玉树、果洛、黄南、海北、海南藏族自治区和海西蒙、藏、哈萨克族自治区的机关干部，目前已开始了宪法草案的宣传和讨论。牧业区各级党委对宪法草案的宣传和讨论极为重视，各族干部在讨论中都非常热烈认真。果洛藏族自治区藏汉族干部于六月二十一日开始讨论。在开始讨论之前，中共果洛地委书记马万里向专区级全体干部作了关于讨论宪法草案重大意义的动员报告。海南藏族自治区为了帮助少数民族干部认真讨论宪法草案，把自治区各机关少数民族干部编成一个学习小组，由专人负责领导，帮助阅读文件和进行讨论。海北藏族自治区决定在讨论每一章开始时，由中共地委书记或负责干部作一次报告或讲解。
