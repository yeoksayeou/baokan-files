    We Must Be Masters of the Furnace
    ——A Record of Technical Innovation in the Gas Generator Furnace at Factory 401
    Bingqian Yinghua
    Soviet Advanced Experience
    Starting in mid-February of this year, Factory 401 added several distillation furnaces, and every day two or three furnaces were affected by production due to insufficient gas supply. This kept the workers of the gas generator furnace section extremely busy. They spent the whole day poking at the furnaces with chisels, so tired they couldn’t lift their arms. But the task was still not completed.
    Gu Zhimin, assistant engineer of the production technology section, noticed this problem and read the Soviet book "Metallurgical Furnaces." The book stated that the thickness of the ash layer, fire layer, and coal layer in the generator furnace should be determined according to the amount of gas needed. However, the situation in the generator furnace section was exactly the opposite; people were rigidly adhering to the rules of "thin coal layer, thin fire layer, and thick ash layer." He wanted to talk to his superiors about this, and it so happened that the factory director asked him to attend a meeting, where it was decided to send him to the workshop.
    "Things Are Difficult"
    The new operation method (adding more coal, removing more ash) began to be tested on March 6. Foreman Zhou Yuyu asked worker Zhang Wenkui to add 400 kilograms more coal than usual, but Zhang Wenkui only nodded and did nothing. He couldn’t figure it out: in the past, it was said that adding less coal was better, but now they were being asked to add more coal. This was not a joke. If the experiment went wrong, several workshops throughout the factory would have to stop production. Wouldn't the new operation method then become a crime? To resolve this doubt, he asked the originator of the "furnace nurturing method" (less ash removal, thin fire layer) – veteran worker Xiao Zhenchang – who was standing next to him: "Old Xiao, what do you think, should we add it?" Xiao Zhenchang said, "Saying is saying, listening is listening, but we have to base it on our actual situation." After hearing Xiao Zhenchang's words, Zhang Wenkui felt even less certain. The section chief told him to add coal, but he just kept nodding. At this time, union chairman Geng Wenxi came, and Zhang Wenkui told Geng Wenxi his thoughts again. After the union chairman's explanation, Zhang Wenkui reluctantly added the coal, but he was three hours late according to the scheduled time.
    The next day, Assistant Engineer Gu Zhimin came to the section excitedly.
  Upon inquiry, he learned that too little coal had been added. He saw the union chairman at a glance and said, "Things are difficult!"
    Preliminary Victory
    There was a shift foreman in this section named Zhang Jinyou. He was usually bold and careful in his work. Once last year, when he was on duty, he accidentally discovered that the fire layer in the furnace was very high, exceeding the regulations, but the workers were quite idle, rarely poking with chisels. Later, he told others about this, but no one paid attention. He submitted a rationalization proposal to the workshop: the fire layer should be thick, but it was not taken seriously. He told the technical personnel, but couldn’t answer when questioned about the reasoning. Thus, his suggestion, as he said, "fell into a well." This time, he was very happy to hear about the experiment with the new operation method. In his shift, they worked completely according to the new regulations. At 5 p.m., the factory announced good news: the distillation section had overfulfilled its task today.
    Another Setback
    Since the initial successful trial, the situation in the generator furnace had been very stable, and the tasks were completed every day. The workers were a little more relaxed, and the technical personnel didn’t check as much. But after ten days, the generator furnace suddenly had problems again: "bloated belly" (gas accumulation in the furnace), insufficient gas supply. So the workers, as before, grabbed their chisels and poked frantically, sweating profusely. Technical personnel were busy checking the operation records: the workers were all operating according to the new regulations.
    The originator of the "furnace nurturing method," Xiao Zhenchang, then spoke his mind: "I said from the beginning that this set of methods wouldn't work. See, shouldn't everyone believe me now?" Some people echoed: "That's right, I was also holding my breath!"
    Union Chairman Geng Wenxi convened a meeting of technical personnel to discuss this matter. After careful inspection by workers and technical personnel, it turned out that an air baffle on the furnace had been blown off by a strong wind, constantly pouring wind into the furnace, making it difficult for the gas to flow out. The gas supply was insufficient because other workshops had opened more furnaces without notifying the generator furnace section in advance. After the flue was cleaned and cleared, the gas flow increased, which drew the gas out of the furnace.
    Once things were clear, everyone's enthusiasm returned, and veteran worker Xiao Zhenchang fell silent.
    Starting Over
    Since the complete success of the generator furnace technical innovation, Xiao Zhenchang couldn’t eat or sleep well. He couldn’t figure it out: he had worked in front of the furnace for many years, putting a lot of effort into it. In terms of practical operation, no one could say that he was worse, so why was he now falling behind?
    One night shift, he became interested in a book that foreman Zhou Yuyu had placed in front of him. He thought: recently, Foreman Zhou has been inseparable from this book at work, there must be good things in the book. He picked it up and saw it was "Metallurgical Furnaces," but he couldn't understand much. He asked Foreman Zhou, "Where is this book from?" Foreman Zhou said, "Published in the Soviet Union, we reprinted it." Xiao Zhenchang then asked, "Tell me, why was it not okay to have a coal layer in the furnace before, but now it's okay?" Foreman Zhou explained the reasoning behind adding more coal and removing more ash – something about carbon dioxide and flow rates. In the past, Xiao Zhenchang didn’t pay much attention when he heard these terms, but this time he found them quite novel. He pondered for a moment and said:
    "Foreman, how about we sign a master-apprentice contract?"
    "What, you want to learn technical theory?"
    "I can't do without learning!" Xiao Zhenchang said with some emotion,
    "In the future, it won't work to just rely on experience without understanding theory. You teach me from the beginning, and I'll learn from scratch."
    Taking Technical Lessons
    Last year, workers rarely formally attended technical lessons, because at that time people thought there was nothing to learn about the operation of generator furnaces. This time, the enthusiasm for learning technology has increased greatly. Some workers said: "We must truly be masters of the furnace from the outside, and we can't be like we were in the past." When technical personnel give lessons, the workers listen very carefully. Especially Xiao Zhenchang, as soon as he saw a change in the furnace that he didn't understand, he would immediately find technical personnel and ask them to talk about it from a theoretical perspective. When he went home from work, he would still lower his head and ponder the lessons he learned in class, creating his own test questions to quiz himself.
    One day, the generator furnace had problems, there was accumulation in the furnace, and coke came out. The workers studied it from a theoretical perspective and determined that Assistant Engineer Gu Zhimin had made a mistake; he had asked the workers to remove too much ash. When the workers pointed it out to him, he immediately reviewed his mistake and said: "...to be honest, my technical level is not high and is far from meeting the requirements of the work! In the future, I will study hard with everyone."
    Continuing to Advance
    In just one month, the gas generator furnace greatly changed its original appearance. The gas supply increased by more than seventy-five percent. In the past, people often came to urge and ask, but now some workers even go to other workshops to "promote" gas! From the perspective of labor protection, now the workers sit by the furnace, focusing on the furnace, thinking about how it is changing inside, or sitting at a table, observing the changes in the various pressure pipes for a while. No one says they are too tired to eat anymore. Some workers even tell their relatives or friends about this happy event.
    The changes in the generator furnace have spread throughout Factory 401, and the employees of various workshops are not willing to fall behind, and many innovations have emerged in quick succession. Currently, what the factory employees are considering is not whether they can complete the national plan this year, but how much they will over fulfill it.

    我们要作炉子的主人
    ——记四○一厂煤气发生炉技术革新
    炳谦　英华
    苏联先进经验
    从今年二月中旬起，四○一厂增开了几个蒸馏炉，每天总有两三个炉子因煤气不足而影响生产。这可把煤气发生炉工段的工人忙坏了。他们整天拿着钎子扒拉炉子，累得抬不起胳膊来。可是任务照旧完不成。
    生产技术科助理工程师古之民注意到这个问题，阅读了苏联“冶金炉”一书。书上说：发生炉里的灰层、火层和煤层的厚薄，应当根据需用的煤气多少来决定。但是发生炉工段的情况恰好和这相反，人们死按着“不要煤层、火层薄、灰层厚”的规程干。他想找上级谈一谈，正巧厂长找他去开会，会上决定让他下车间。
    “事不好办”
    新操作法（多加煤、多出灰）在三月六日开始试验。工长周裕愚叫工人张文魁比往常多加四百公斤煤，可是张文魁只点头不动手。他想不通：过去说少加煤好，现在又让多加煤，这可不是闹着玩的，如果试验出差子来，全厂几个车间都要停止生产，新操作法岂不变成了罪恶？为解决这个疑问，他便问旁边的“养炉法”（少扒灰、火层要薄）的创始人——老工人肖振昌：“老肖，依你看，加得加不得？”肖振昌说：“说是说，听是听，得根据咱们的实际情况来。”张文魁听了肖振昌的话，心里更有底了。工段长喊他加煤，他还是光点头。这时，工会主席耿文喜来了，张文魁又把他的想法向耿文喜诉说了一遍。经工会主席的解释，张文魁才勉强把煤加进去，可是按规定时间晚了三个钟头。
    第二天，助理工程师古之民兴冲冲地来到工段
  一查问，才知煤加少了。他一眼看到工会主席，就说：“事不好办！”
    初步胜利
    这个工段里有个值班工长，叫张金有。他平时干活胆大心细。去年有一回他值班时，偶然发现炉里火层很高，超过了规定，可是工人们都挺清闲，扒拉钎子的次数很少。后来他把这回事讲给别人听，谁也没有注意；向车间提合理化建议：火层要厚，也未被重视；向技术人员讲，一扣道理就答不上来。于是他的建议如他所说：“掉井里了”。这次他听说试验新操作法很高兴。在他这一班，完全按新的规定干活。到了下午五点钟，工厂里传出了喜报：今天蒸馏工段超额完成了任务。
    风波再起
    从初次试验成功以后，发生炉的情况一直很稳定，天天完成任务。工人有些清闲了，技术人员也不大查问了。可是过了十来天，发生炉忽然又出了毛病：“涨肚子”（炉内煤气积压），煤气供应不足。于是工人们又和从前一样，抄起钎子紧扒拉，忙得满头大汗。技术人员忙着检查操作记录：工人们都是按新规程操作的。
    “养炉法”的创始人——肖振昌这时说出了心里的话：“一起初我就说这一套不行。看，大伙该相信了吧？”有些人也随声附和：“可不是，我也捏了一把汗！”
    工会主席耿文喜为这事召集技术人员开了一个会。随后经工人、技术人员仔细一检查，原来是炉子上的一个空气挡板被大风刮掉了，一个劲往炉子里灌风，煤气不容易往外流通。煤气供应不足，是因为别的工段多开了炉子事先未通知发生炉工段。烟道经扫除畅通后，煤气流量增大，就把炉内的煤气抽过去了。
    事情一弄清楚，大家的劲头又起来了，老工人肖振昌一声不响了。
    从头学起
    自从发生炉技术革新完全成功以后，肖振昌饭不想吃，觉也睡不着了。他想不通：在炉前干了好几年了，为炉子化过不少心血；论实际操作，谁也不能说自己差，为什么如今就落后了呢？
    有一天夜班，他对工长周裕愚面前放的一本书发生了兴趣。他想：近来周工长在工作中离不开这本书，书上必有好东西。他拿过来一看是“冶金炉”，可是看不大懂。他问周工长：“这本书是哪里出的？”周工长说：“苏联出版，咱们翻印的。”肖振昌接着问：“你说说，为什么以前炉内一有煤层就不行，而现在就行了呢？”周工长就把多加煤多出灰的道理——什么二氧化碳呀，流量呀，讲给他听。在过去，肖振昌听见这些名词不大留心，这回感到挺新鲜。他沉思一会儿说：
    “工长，咱俩订个师徒合同行不？”
    “怎么，你想学技术理论吗？”
    “不学可不行了！”肖振昌有所感慨地说，
    “往后光凭经验不懂理论行不通了。你从头教，我从头来学。”
    上技术课
    去年一年，工人们很少正式上过技术课，因为那时人们都认为发生炉的操作方法没有什么可学的。这回学技术的劲头大起来了。有的工人说：“我们在炉外要真正作炉内的主，可不能像过去那样了。”在技术人员上课时，工人都很用心听。尤其是肖振昌，一见炉内发生了自己不明白的变化，马上去找技术人员，要他们从理论上谈一谈。他下班回家走在路上，还低头琢磨在班上学的功课，自己出题目考问自己。
    有一天，发生炉出了毛病，炉内积压，出了焦子。工人们从理论上一研究，是助理工程师古之民搞错了，他让工人出的灰过多了。工人们一给他指出来，他立刻检讨说：“……说实在的，我的技术水平不高，离工作要求还差得很远！以后我要好好向大家学习。”
    继续前进
    仅仅经过一个月的时间，煤气发生炉大大改变了原来的面貌。煤气供应量提高了百分之七十五以上。过去常有人来催问，现在有的工人还到别的车间去“推销”煤气呢！从劳动保护方面看，现在工人们坐在炉旁，眼钉着炉子，思考炉内在怎样变化，或者坐在桌子前，观察一会儿各个压力管的变化。再也听不到谁说累得吃不下饭的事了。有的工人还把这个喜事告诉自己的亲人或朋友。
    发生炉的变化传遍了四○一厂，各车间职工都不甘落后，紧跟着出现了许多创举。目前，全厂职工考虑的不是今年能否完成国家计划，而是超额多少的问题了。
