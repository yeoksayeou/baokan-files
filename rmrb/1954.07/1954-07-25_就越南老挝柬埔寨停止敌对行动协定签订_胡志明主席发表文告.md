Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, July 24th: The Vietnam News Agency reports that Ho Chi Minh, President of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, issued a proclamation to the people, military personnel, and cadres of Vietnam on July 22, 1954, regarding the signing of the Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. The full text of the proclamation is as follows:

"Compatriots across the country, all military personnel and cadres:

    The Geneva Conference has concluded. We have achieved a great victory in diplomacy.

    On behalf of the government, I hereby issue the following proclamation to all compatriots, all military personnel, and cadres across the country.

  (1) For the peace, unification, independence, and democracy of the motherland, the people, army, cadres, and government of our country have been closely united over the past eight or nine years, enduring all kinds of suffering, overcoming all difficulties, resolutely fighting, and achieving glorious victories. At this moment, on behalf of the government, I would like to extend warm congratulations to all compatriots from the north to the south and to all combat personnel and cadres. I mourn for the soldiers and compatriots who heroically sacrificed their lives for the motherland and extend my condolences to the wounded and sick soldiers.

    Our great victory is also due to the support of the people of friendly countries, the French people, and peace-loving people all over the world for our just cause.

    Because of these victories, and because of the efforts made by the Soviet representative at the Berlin Conference, the government of our country and the government of France were able to begin negotiations at the Geneva Conference. At the Geneva Conference, thanks to the struggle of our delegation and with the help of the delegations of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, we achieved great victory: the French government recognized the independence, sovereignty, unification, and territorial integrity of our country, and agreed to withdraw French armed forces from our land, and others.

    From now on, we must strive to consolidate peace in the country, achieve unification, and achieve independence and democracy.

  (2) The first step to be taken to achieve peace is that the armed forces of both sides should cease fire.

    In order to implement the ceasefire, the armed forces of both sides must be concentrated in two separate areas, that is to say, the military regions must be readjusted.

    The demarcation of the military boundary line is a temporary and transitional measure taken to achieve a ceasefire, restore peace, and achieve national unification through universal suffrage. The boundary line by no means implies a political or territorial boundary.

    During the ceasefire, our armed forces will be concentrated in North Vietnam, while the French Federation forces will be concentrated in South Vietnam. This means that both sides will exchange some areas. Some French-occupied areas will become liberated areas. On the other hand, some of our liberated areas will become temporary places for French forces to stay before returning to France.

    This is a necessary measure. However, North, Central, and South Vietnam are all inseparable parts of our country, and our country will surely be unified, and our compatriots all over the country will surely be liberated.

    Our compatriots in the South were the first to rise up to carry out the patriotic war, and they are people with a high degree of awareness. I believe that they will put the interests of the whole country above the interests of the locality, the long-term interests above the immediate interests, and will work side by side with the rest of our people to consolidate peace, achieve unification, and achieve independence and democracy throughout the country. The Vietnam Workers' Party, the government, and I myself always pay close attention to the efforts of our compatriots in the South and are deeply convinced that they will be victorious.

  (3) The struggle to consolidate peace, achieve unification, and achieve independence and democracy is also a long and arduous struggle. In order to achieve victory, all the people, all military personnel, and cadres from the north to the south must strengthen unity and achieve unity in thought and action.

    We are determined to faithfully implement the agreement we have signed with the French government, and at the same time, we demand that the French government also faithfully implement the agreement it has signed with us.

    We must strive to consolidate peace and maintain a high degree of vigilance against the conspiracies of peace disruptors.

    We must strive to win free general elections throughout the country to achieve national unification.

    We must strive to restore, build, consolidate, and develop our strengths in all aspects to achieve the complete independence of the motherland.

    We must strive to implement social reforms to improve the living conditions of our people and achieve genuine democracy.

    We want to further consolidate our fraternal friendship with the peoples of Laos and Cambodia.

    We must consolidate the great friendship between Vietnam and the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and all other friendly countries. We want to further strengthen our unity with the French people, the Asian people, and the people of the world to defend peace.

  (4) I earnestly call on the people of the whole country and all military personnel and cadres to correctly implement the political line and policies of the Party and the government, and to strive to consolidate peace, achieve unification, and achieve independence and democracy throughout the country.

    I earnestly call on all those who love the motherland, regardless of social class, religious belief, or political opinion, and regardless of which party they stood on before, to sincerely cooperate with each other and strive for the interests of the nation and the motherland, so as to realize peace, unification, independence, and democracy in our beloved Vietnam.

    With the unification of the whole country, with the unity of all the people like one person, we will surely be able to achieve victory.

    Long live peace, unification, independence, and democracy in Vietnam!

        President of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam Ho Chi Minh (signed)
                    July 22, 1954"

    就越南老挝柬埔寨停止敌对行动协定签订
    胡志明主席发表文告
   【新华社二十四日讯】越南通讯社北越二十四日讯：越南民主共和国胡志明主席在一九五四年七月二十二日就越南、老挝和柬埔寨的停止敌对行动协定的签订，向越南全国人民、军队人员和干部发表文告。文告全文如下：“全国同胞们，全体军队人员和干部们：
    日内瓦会议已经结束了。我们在外交方面取得了一个伟大的胜利。
    我谨代表政府向全国同胞、全体军队人员和干部发表文告如下。
  （一）为了祖国的和平、统一、独立和民主，我国人民、军队、干部和政府在过去八九年中，紧密团结一致，经历了种种痛苦，克服了一切困难，坚决进行战斗，并取得了光辉的胜利。在这个时候，我谨代表政府向从北部到南部的全国同胞，全体战斗人员和干部致以热诚的祝贺。我谨为为了祖国而英勇牺牲了自己生命的战士和同胞们志哀，并向负伤和卧病的军人致以慰问。
    我们获得伟大的胜利也是由于我们为正义的事业而进行的斗争得到了各友好国家的人民、法国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民的支援。
    由于这些胜利，由于苏联代表在柏林会议上所作的努力，我国政府和法国政府得以在日内瓦会议上开始进行谈判。在日内瓦会议上，由于我国代表团的斗争，由于苏联和中华人民共和国两国代表团的帮助，我们取得了一个伟大的胜利：法国政府承认了我国的独立、主权、统一和领土完整，并同意了从我们的土地上撤退法国武装部队，以及其他。
    从今以后，我们必须努力奋斗，以在全国巩固和平，实现统一，并取得独立和民主。
    （二）为了实现和平必须采取的第一个步骤是双方的武装部队应该停火。
    为了实行停火，必须把双方武装部队集结到两个各别的地区去，那就是说，重新调整军事地区。
    划定军事分界线是为了实现停战、恢复和平和用普选的方法实现全国的统一而采取的一项暂时的、过渡性的措施。分界线绝不意味着是政治的或领土的边界。
    在停战期间，我们的武装部队将集中在越南北部，而法兰西联邦部队集中在越南南部，这意味着双方将交换一些地区。有一些法国占领的地区将成为解放区。另一方面，我们有一些解放区将成为法国部队回法国之前的暂时驻扎的地方。
    这是一项必要的措施。但是，越南北部、中部和南部都是我国领土的不可分割的部分，我国一定会得到统一、我们全国各地的同胞一定会得到解放。
    我们南部的同胞是首先起来进行爱国战争的人，是有着高度觉悟的人。我相信他们将把全国的利益放在地方的利益之上，把长远的利益放在眼前的利益之上，并将和我国其余人民并肩努力，为巩固和平、实现统一、在全国取得独立和民主而奋斗。越南劳动党、政府和我本人始终密切注意南部的同胞的努力，并深信他们必将获得胜利。
    （三）巩固和平、实现统一、取得独立和民主的斗争也是一场长期艰苦的斗争。为了获得胜利，从北部到南部的全体人民、全体军队人员和干部必须加强团结，必须在思想上和行动上取得一致。
    我们决心忠实履行我们和法国政府签订的协定，同时，我们要求法国政府也忠实履行它和我们签订的协定。
    我们必须努力巩固和平，并对和平破坏者的阴谋保持高度的警惕。
    我们必须努力争取在全国举行自由普选，以实现全国的统一。
    我们必须努力恢复、建设、巩固和发展我们各方面的力量，以实现祖国的完全独立。
    我们必须努力实行社会改革，以改善我国人民的生活条件，并实现真正的民主。
    我们要进一步巩固我们同老挝和柬埔寨两国人民之间的兄弟般的友谊。
    我们要巩固越南同苏联、中华人民共和国以及其他友好国家之间的伟大友谊。我们要进一步加强我们同法国人民、亚洲人民以及全世界人民之间的团结，来保卫和平。
    （四）我恳切地号召全国人民和全体军队人员及干部正确执行党和政府的政治路线和政策，并且为巩固和平、实现统一、在全国取得独立和民主而奋斗。
    我恳切地号召所有热爱祖国的人们，不分社会阶级、宗教信仰和政治见解，也不论他们以前是站在任何党派方面，真诚地彼此合作，为了民族和祖国的利益而奋斗，以求在我们所热爱的越南实现和平、统一、独立和民主。
    有了全国的统一，有了全体人民的像一个人一样的团结，我们一定能够取得胜利。
    越南的和平、统一、独立和民主万岁！
        越南民主共和国主席  胡志明（签名）
                    一九五四年七月二十二日”
