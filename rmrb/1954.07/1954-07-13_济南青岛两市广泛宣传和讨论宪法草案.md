    Jinan and Qingdao Widely Publicize and Discuss Draft Constitution
    The activity of widely publicizing and discussing the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China has been fully launched among the people of all circles in Jinan and Qingdao. By July 7th, more than 100,000 cadres of organs, enterprise employees, and school teachers and students in Jinan City had successively listened to two reports on the Draft Constitution, and employees of private factories and shops and residents of streets throughout the city had also generally listened to the first lecture on the Draft Constitution. The vast majority of organs, factories, enterprises, schools, and some street residents in Qingdao City have completed the discussion of the "Preamble" and "General Principles" of the Draft Constitution and have begun to transition to the publicity and discussion of the "State Organs" section. The Shandong Provincial Draft Constitution Discussion Committee has initially collected 160 pieces of proposed revisions and questions raised by people from all walks of life in Jinan and Qingdao during the discussion.
    In recent days, the work of more than 34,300 reporters, propagandists, and grassroots cadres who have been trained in these two cities has become even more intense. The reading groups in factories and streets are also particularly active. Employees and residents are using almost all of their newspaper reading time to read articles in newspapers about the discussion and explanation of the Draft Constitution; big-character posters and blackboards are also filled with people's experiences and feelings after discussing the Draft Constitution. Many street propaganda teams in Jinan City are also conducting small-scale propaganda activities during the evening when residents are enjoying the cool air.
    During the publicity and discussion activities, the enthusiasm of the vast number of cadres and the masses is very high. Cadres of various organs in Jinan City have carefully read theoretical books on constitutional issues and have discussed and studied the full text of the Draft Constitution chapter by chapter and article by article. When discussing Article 94 of the Draft Constitution, the members of the Communist Youth League and young employees of the Jinan Flour Mill were so excited that they sang the song "I Love My Motherland." Meng Zhaochuan, a retired old worker from the Qingdao Electric Power Bureau, automatically comes to participate in every discussion.
    The discussion and publicity of the Draft Constitution has stimulated the enthusiasm and creativity of the vast number of employees in production. Yang Zhonghai, a worker at the Jinan Diesel Engine Factory and a city labor model, took the initiative to help others modify a cutting tool, increasing efficiency by one and a half times. Han Shulong and Wang Shuqian, workers at the Jinan Power Plant and city labor models, said in the discussion that they would strengthen circuit inspections during the thunderstorm season, eliminate hidden accidents, and ensure safe power transmission. After the discussion, the business personnel of the Second Retail Store of the Jinan City Consumer Cooperative also formulated four covenants to better serve the members.

    济南青岛两市广泛宣传和讨论宪法草案
    广泛地宣传和讨论中华人民共和国宪法草案的活动，已在济南、青岛两市各界人民中全面展开。到七月七日止，济南市十多万名机关干部、企业职工、学校师生已先后听取了两次有关宪法草案的报告，全市私营工厂、商店职工和街道居民也普遍听取了宪法草案第一讲的报告。青岛市绝大部分机关、工厂企业、学校以及部分街道居民已结束了宪法草案“序言”和“总纲”部分的讨论，开始转入
  “国家机构”部分的宣传和讨论。山东省宪法草案讨论委员会已初步搜集了济南、青岛两市各界人民讨论中提出的修改意见和问题一百六十条。
    近几天来，这两个城市经过训练的三万四千三百多名报告员、宣传员和基层干部的工作已更加紧张。各工厂和街道中的读报组也显得格外活跃。职工和居民们几乎以全部读报时间阅读报纸上有关讨论和解释宪法草案的文章；大字报和黑板报上也写满了人们讨论宪法草案后的体会和感想。济南市许多街道上的宣传队在晚间居民乘凉时间，还都在进行小型的宣传活动。
    在宣传和讨论活动中，广大干部和群众的情绪都很高涨。济南市各机关干部认真阅读了有关宪法问题的理论书籍，并对宪法草案全文逐章逐条进行讨论和钻研。济南面粉厂青年团员和青年职工在讨论到宪法草案第九十四条时，兴奋得高唱起“我爱我的祖国”的歌曲来。青岛电业局已经退休的老工人孟昭川，在每次讨论时，都自动地跑来参加。
    经过对宪法草案的讨论和宣传，激发了广大职工生产中的积极性和创造热情。济南柴油机厂工人、市劳动模范杨仲海主动地帮助别人改装了一件切削工具，提高效率一倍半。济南发电厂工人、市劳动模范韩书龙、王书倩在讨论中表示：要在雷雨季节，加强电路检查，消灭隐形事故，保证安全送电。济南市消费合作社第二零售店的营业人员在讨论后，还订出了四项公约，要更好地为社员服务。
