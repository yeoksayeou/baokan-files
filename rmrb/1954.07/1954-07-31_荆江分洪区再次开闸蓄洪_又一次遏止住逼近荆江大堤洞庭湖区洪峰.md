Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, July 30th. Recently, rainfall in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River in Guizhou, Sichuan, and the Three Gorges area caused another flood peak on the Yangtze River to approach the Jingjiang Dike and Dongting Lake area. The Jingjiang Flood Diversion Area reopened its gates to store floodwaters on the 29th. At 6:10 AM that day, the Yangtze River water level in Shashi rose to 44.22 meters. At this time, the Taipingkou Flood Diversion Gate in the diversion area, facing the Yangtze River and the Hutukou River, slowly opened its gates, and by 9:00 AM, all 54 gates were fully opened. According to calculations by the Yangtze River Water Resources Commission based on the water conditions at the Shashi upstream station, if the gates were not opened in time for flood diversion, the highest water level in Shashi on the 30th might rise again to 45.02 meters, exceeding the highest historical water level in Shashi by 5.3 Chinese inches [cun]. After the flood diversion area opened its gates for flood diversion, the rapidly rising flood peak was once again curbed. At 7:00 AM on the 30th, the actual water level in Shashi was 44.37 meters.
    The Jingjiang Flood Diversion Area's Taipingkou Flood Diversion Gate first opened its gates for flood diversion on the morning of the 22nd, and the gates were immediately closed when the flood receded on the afternoon of the 27th. The first flood diversion volume was approximately 2 billion cubic meters. After closing the gates, the Yangtze River Water Resources Commission sent technical cadres together with engineers and other technical personnel from the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Flood Control Headquarters to carefully inspect the safety of the Taipingkou Flood Diversion Gate construction project in the diversion area, proving that this modern and great project had withstood the flood test of the first flood diversion, and all the gate piers, gates, and their construction foundations were safe and undamaged.

    荆江分洪区再次开闸蓄洪
    又一次遏止住逼近荆江大堤洞庭湖区洪峰
    【新华社武汉三十日电】近日长江上游贵州、四川地区和三峡一带降雨，长江又一次洪峰逼近荆江大堤和洞庭湖区，荆江分洪区在二十九日再次启闸蓄洪。当天六点十分钟，沙市的长江水位上涨到四十四点二二公尺。这时，面临着长江和虎渡河口的分洪区太平口进洪闸，闸门徐徐启开，到九点钟的时候五十四孔闸门全部开放。据长江水利委员会根据沙市上游站水情的演算，如不适时开闸分洪，这一次洪峰到来，沙市的最高水位三十日可能再回涨到四十五点零二公尺，就要超过沙市历年最高水位五点三公寸。经过分洪区开闸分洪后，急剧上涨的洪峰又一次被遏止住了，三十日上午七时，沙市实际水位四十四点三七公尺。
    荆江分洪区太平口进洪闸首次开闸分洪是在二十二日早晨，到二十七日下午洪水退落时当即关闭了闸门。第一次进洪量约有二十多亿立方公尺。闭闸后，长江水利委员会曾派技术干部会同荆江分洪防汛总指挥部的工程师及其他技术人员，认真检查了分洪区太平口进洪闸建筑工程的安全情况，证明这一现代化的伟大工程经过首次分洪的洪水考验，全部闸墩、闸门和它的建筑基础都安全无损。
