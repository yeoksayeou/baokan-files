Xinhua News Agency, July 28th: The aggressive and violent acts of U.S. Air Force planes invading our country's airspace on July 26th, shooting down two of our planes, and attacking our ships in international waters were deliberately carried out under the direct command of the U.S. government. Their conspiratorial purpose is to expand aggression against the People's Republic of China and create new international tensions after the Geneva Conference.

Following the accidental incident involving a British transport plane over Yulin Port, Hainan Island, on the morning of July 23rd, U.S. warmongers used this as an excuse to issue a series of slanderous and intimidating cries in Washington. On the 24th, U.S. Secretary of Defense Wilson, using the pretext of rescuing the crashed British plane, ordered a mixed fleet composed of two U.S. aircraft carriers ("Wasp" and "Philippine Sea") and eight destroyers to the waters near Hainan Island to provoke us, attempting to escalate the situation. According to U.S. news agencies, this provocative activity by the United States was personally and directly commanded by the U.S. warmonger, Chief of Naval Operations Carney.

After the aggressive and violent act of U.S. planes invading our country's airspace and shooting down our planes, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles, the U.S. Department of Defense, and U.S. Pacific Fleet Commander Stump made statements and speeches in Washington on the 26th. They admitted without hesitation the crime of U.S. planes shooting down our planes, but shamelessly concealed and denied the guilt of U.S. planes invading our country's airspace for provocation and attacking our ships in international waters. On the 27th, the U.S. State Department again used the despicable trick of a thief crying "stop thief," issuing a so-called "protest" statement against the People's Republic of China, making a counter-accusation, and attempting to deceive the public and escape the severe condemnation of world opinion against this deliberate act of aggression and provocation by the United States.

In fact, since U.S. imperialism occupied our territory of Taiwan, it has not only consistently instructed and supported the Chiang Kai-shek remnants in harassing our regions and islands, but also the U.S. Navy and Air Force have continuously violated our territorial waters and airspace, carrying out blatant acts of aggression. According to incomplete statistics, from June 1950 to February 1954, U.S. aircraft intruded into our country's airspace a total of 7,632 batches, 32,997 sorties. U.S. warships intruded into our country's territorial waters a total of 336 times, 704 vessels. The intrusions by U.S. planes and warships have caused significant losses to the lives and property of our people. On July 27, 1953, when intruding into our Northeast airspace, the invading U.S. aircraft also shot down a passenger plane of our friendly neighbor, the Soviet Union, flying on a regular route, causing the deaths of 21 people on board. Before and after the Geneva Conference, the U.S. Navy and Air Force intensified their activities hostile to the Chinese people along the Chinese coast and nearby areas, such as demonstrations and exercises. Behind these activities of the U.S. warmongering clique is a madly ambitious desire to aggress against the People's Republic of China. They not only want to continue occupying our territory of Taiwan, but also attempt to instruct and support the Chiang Kai-shek remnants in occupying Hainan Island as a base for launching attacks against our mainland. Constantine Brown, a columnist for the U.S. Washington "Star," revealed their ambition on February 6th of this year. Brown said: "If the Nationalist troops are supplied with the necessary logistics, they can recover Hainan Island, the large island in the Gulf of Tokyo." He also said: "Chiang Kai-shek's troops are still capable of launching fierce attacks on South China from Hainan Island and Taiwan."

This time, the U.S. warmongering clique used the accidental incident, which has been rationally resolved through diplomatic channels between China and Britain, to send a large number of warships and planes to provoke us and spread a tense atmosphere. This is a manifestation of the policy of the U.S. imperialist warmongering clique being hostile to the Chinese people and intensifying the creation of new tensions in the context of the Indochina armistice agreement being reached. This cannot be concealed by any distortion or propaganda. This adventurous action by the U.S. warmongering clique has even caused some people within the U.S. ruling clique to feel uneasy because they believe it is too blatant. U.S. Republican Congressman A. L. Miller said: "I don't think we have any reason to send our planes, ships, and personnel to patrol along the Chinese coast." He said: "It seems that some people (in the United States) are eager to try and are一心想打(single mindedly want to fight/start a war)."

Currently, various reports indicate that the U.S. warmongering clique is still blatantly disregarding the widespread international dissatisfaction with this behavior of creating a war crisis, attempting to continue expanding its provocative activities. According to the United Press, U.S. naval authorities in Washington announced on the evening of the 26th that Carney, the U.S. Chief of Naval Operations who directly commanded this aggressive action, had ordered the U.S. fleet and planes to continue provocative and aggressive activities against the People's Republic of China under the pretext of "rescuing" the crashed plane. There are also reports that the United States is sending additional aircraft carriers to the Hainan Island area. In his statement, Zhang Hanfu, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government, has issued a serious warning to the U.S. government. If the U.S. government does not immediately stop these acts of aggression, then it will bear all the responsibilities caused by its provocations and reap the bitter fruit.

### 美国蓄意对我国扩大侵略制造紧张局势  如果美国不立即停止这种侵犯行动必将自食其果

    美国蓄意对我国扩大侵略制造紧张局势
    如果美国不立即停止这种侵犯行动必将自食其果
    【新华社二十八日讯】美国空军飞机在七月二十六日侵入我国领空击落我国飞机两架、并在公海上袭击我国船舰的侵略暴行，是在美国政府的直接指挥之下蓄意进行的，其阴谋目的是要在日内瓦会议之后扩大对中华人民共和国的侵略、制造新的国际紧张局势。
    在七月二十三日早晨一架英国运输机在海南岛榆林港上空发生意外事件之后，美国好战分子就以此为借口，在华盛顿发出一连串诬蔑性和恫吓性的叫嚣。二十四日，美国国防部长威尔逊即借口救援失事的英国飞机，下令派遣两艘美国航空母舰（“黄蜂号”和“菲律宾海号”）和八艘驱逐舰组成的混合舰队到海南岛附近海面，向我寻衅，企图扩大事态。据美国通讯社报道，美国这一挑衅活动是由美国好战分子、海军作战部长卡湼亲自直接指挥的。
    在美机侵入我国领空并击落我机的侵略暴行发生之后，美国国务卿杜勒斯、美国国防部和美国太平洋舰队司令斯图普二十六日在华盛顿都发表了声明和谈话。他们对美机击落我机的罪行直认不讳，但却对美机侵入我国领空进行挑衅及在公海袭击我国船舰的罪责进行无耻掩饰和抵赖。二十七日，美国国务院又施用贼喊捉贼的卑鄙惯技，发出了对中华人民共和国的所谓“抗议”声明，反咬一口，想这样来蒙混视听，逃避世界舆论对美国这种蓄意的侵略挑衅行为的严正谴责。
    事实上，美帝国主义自从侵占我国领土台湾以来，不仅一贯指使和支持蒋介石残匪对我国地区和岛屿进行骚扰，而且美国的海空军也不断侵犯我国领海领空，进行彰明昭著的侵略活动。据不完全统计，从一九五○年六月到一九五四年二月的期间，美国飞机侵入我国领空的共有七六三二批，三二九九七架次。美舰侵入我国领海的共有三三六次，七○四艘。美机美舰的侵袭，使我国人民生命财产遭受了重大损失，而一九五三年七月二十七日，侵朝美机在窜扰我国东北领空时，并曾击落我友邦苏联的在正规航线上飞行的客机一架，使机上人员二十一人死难。在日内瓦会议举行的前后，美国海空军更加紧在中国沿海及附近进行敌视中国人民的示威、演习等活动。美国好战集团的这些活动的后面，包藏着对中华人民共和国的狂妄的侵略野心。他们不仅想继续侵占我国领土台湾，而且还妄图指使和支持蒋介石残匪侵占海南岛，作为对我国大陆发动攻击的基地。美国华盛顿“明星报”专栏作家康斯坦丁·布朗今年二月六日就曾透露了他们的这种野心。布朗说：“若是供给国民党军队必要的后勤物资的话，他们就可以收复在东京湾的海南岛这个大岛。”他并且说：“蒋介石的军队还有能力从海南岛和台湾向华南进行猛烈的袭击。”
    美国好战集团这次利用已由中国和英国之间遵循外交途径进行合理解决的意外事件，出动大批军舰、飞机前来寻衅，并大事散布紧张空气，正是美帝国主义好战集团和中国人民为敌并在印度支那停战协议达成情况下加紧制造新的紧张局势的政策的表现。这决不是任何歪曲宣传所掩饰得了的。美国好战集团的这一冒险行动甚至在美国统治集团内部也有人认为作得太过露骨而感到不安。美国共和党众议员阿·勒·米勒说：“我不认为我们有理由可以派我们的飞机、船只和人员到中国海岸沿岸一带去巡逻”，他说：“看起来，好像（美国）有些人在跃跃欲试，一心想打。”
    现在，各种消息显示美国好战集团还正在悍然不顾国际对于美国这种制造战争危机的行径普遍表示的不满，企图继续扩大其挑衅活动。据合众社报道：华盛顿的美国海军当局在二十六日晚宣布说：直接指挥这次侵略行动的美国海军作战部长卡湼，已经命令美国的舰队和飞机继续在“救援”失事飞机的借口下进行对中华人民共和国的挑衅和侵略活动。又有消息说，美国还在增派航空母舰到海南岛地区去。我中央人民政府外交部副部长章汉夫在声明中已向美国政府提出严重警告，如果美国政府不立即停止这种侵犯行动，那么，它将承担由其挑衅所引起的一切责任，并自食其果。
