    Shenyang Mining Machinery Plant Produces Fifteen-Ton Derrick Crane
    At 5:00 PM on June 27th, the Shenyang Mining Machinery Plant's radio station broadcasted exciting news: "Our country's first fifteen-ton derrick crane has been successfully trial-produced and will be tested soon!" Then the after-work bell rang, and workers from various workshops rushed to the testing ground. All preparations for the test run had been completed. The factory director raised a national flag and said, "Who wants to plant the motherland's flag on our own newly manufactured product?" The workers surrounded the director, vying to go. Finally, Wang Lianjie and Zhao Mingyuan carried out this glorious task. As the national flag fluttered on top of the crane, people became even more excited. The leader of the test run team stood on a high pier and waved a small red flag. The thirty-five-meter-tall crane giant lowered its large hand, hooking a fifteen-ton bundle of steel ingot molds. As the five winches whirred, it effortlessly lifted the steel ingot molds twenty-five meters into the air and turned them halfway around. At this moment, the people in the square applauded and cheered: "Success! Success!" Everyone cheered and jumped for joy that the factory had successfully trial-produced its eighth major new product this year. From that time until the next day, workers kept going to the testing ground to see the fruits of their labor over the past two months. Workers from the first section of the processing workshop, who had just finished their night shift, walked to the base of the crane, touched the smooth large shaft with both hands, and said excitedly, "The parts we made are used here!" They had put a lot of thought into making this part, manufacturing a very special burnishing machine to ensure its quality met the requirements. The chief engineer, holding a small hammer, tapped the rivets on the frame and said to everyone with a smile, "Very good! Very good!" The welders also proudly touched the seams on the frame. When preparing to manufacture this crane, they had specially sent people to Dalian to learn the Soviet Union's advanced welding methods, making each welded seam as smooth as if it had been coated with a layer of paint.
    This new and huge crane is specially designed for docks and large construction sites, and it can replace the work of three hundred porters.

    沈阳矿山机器厂制成十五吨桅杆起重机
    六月二十七日下午五时，沈阳矿山机器厂的广播电台播送了一个喜讯：“我国第一台十五吨桅杆起重机已经试制完成，马上就要试车了！”接着下班的电铃响了，各车间的工人都向试验场奔去，试车的一切准备工作都已作好，厂长举起一面国旗说：“谁愿意把祖国的国旗插到我们自己制造的新产品上去？”工人们围着厂长争着要去，最后由王连杰、赵明元执行了这一光荣的任务。当国旗在起重机顶上迎风飘扬时，人们的心情更加紧张了。试车组的组长站到高墩子上把红色小旗一挥，三十五公尺高的起重巨人放下它的大手，钩起了十五吨重的一捆钢锭模，随着五部卷扬机轧轧作响，它很轻松地将钢锭模举到二十五公尺高的上空，转了一个半圆圈。这时广场上的人们鼓掌欢呼起来：“成功了！成功了！”大家为全厂在今年内试制成功了第八种重大的新产品而欢呼跳跃。从那个时候起一直到第二天，工人们不住地到试验场，上去观看他们两个多月的劳动成果。刚下了夜班的加工车间第一工段的工人走到起重机的座子旁，双手摸摸光滑的大轴，兴奋地说：“我们做的部件用在这儿啦！”他们为了做这个部件花了很多脑筋，制造了一部很特别的滚光机才使它的质量达到了要求。总工程师拿着小锤头，敲着架体上的铆钉，笑嘻嘻地对人们说：“很好！很好！”电焊工人们也骄傲地摸摸架体上的一条条的接缝，他们在准备制造这部起重机时，曾特地派人到大连去学习了苏联的先进焊接法，使得每一条焊接的缝都像涂了一层漆一样的平滑。
    这个新型巨大的起重机是专门供给码头和大型工地使用的，它可以代替三百个搬运工人的工作。          （新华社）
