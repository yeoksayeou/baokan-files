The Nanjing Laboratory of the Central Geological Department launched a labor competition in May and achieved significant results. In terms of quality, the rework rate decreased from an average of 7.8% last year to 1.8%, with the rework rate for iron determination dropping to 0.43%.

The laboratory staff proposed a total of 54 suggestions for innovations, both large and small. For example, the copper determination group designed a rack for large-scale filtration, changing the usual situation of holding a beaker for up and down filtration and washing each time, reducing labor intensity and increasing efficiency by more than twofold. The iron determination group combined the four steps of adding reagents into one step, modified the automatic titrator, and designed an electric stirring device for titrating the solution, which greatly improved efficiency. Xu Ziliang, a ore crushing worker, designed an automatic vibrating sieve device, replacing heavy manual labor and shortening the time for ore crushing.

    中央地质部南京化验室展开劳动竞赛
    地质分析的质量和效率都有提高
    中央地质部南京化验室在五月份开展了劳动竞赛，取得了显著的成绩。质量上返工率由去年的平均百分之七点八降到百分之一点八，其中测定铁的返工率降到百分之零点四三。
    化验室职工先后提出大小五十四件革新的建议。如定铜小组设计了供大规模过滤用的架子，改变了通常过滤时每次拿着一个烧杯上下过滤洗涤的情况，减轻了劳动强度，效率提高二倍多。定铁小组把加试剂的四个步骤合并成一个步骤，改装了自动滴定管，并设计了电动搅拌滴定溶液的装置，使效率大大提高。碎矿工人徐自良设计了自动振筛装置，代替了繁重的体力劳动，缩短了碎矿的时间。
