Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 22nd: The Jingjiang Flood Diversion Area in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River opened its floodgates for flood storage on the morning of the 22nd. At 2:10 AM on the 22nd, the 1,054-meter-long Taipingkou floodgate, under the command of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Flood Control Headquarters, opened, and the Yangtze River floodwaters flowed in through the opened gates. By 8:00 AM, all 54 gate openings were fully opened, with floodwaters entering the diversion area at a rate of more than 5,600 cubic meters per second.

Since the beginning of summer, rainfall in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River has been excessively concentrated, and the water levels in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, Dongting Lake, and Poyang Lake have generally risen, generally exceeding the highest flood levels in previous years. Recently, heavy rains have continued in the Sichuan area and the Three Gorges area in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, and the flood peaks from the upper reaches have followed one after another, converging with the high water levels in the middle reaches. After 8:00 PM on the 21st, the floodwaters in Jingjiang rose at an average rate of 6 centimeters per hour. By the time of the flood diversion on the morning of the 22nd, the water level in Shashi had reached 44.39 meters, and the flood was still showing a sharp upward trend. Therefore, the flood seriously threatened the safety of the Jingjiang Dike and also threatened the safety of the Dongting Lake area. At this time, the Central-South Region Flood Control Headquarters, after requesting and obtaining approval from the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government, immediately ordered the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Flood Control Headquarters to open the floodgates for flood diversion. After the floodgates were opened, the water level in Shashi immediately stopped rising. At 11:00 AM on the 22nd, the water level in Shashi had dropped to 44.30 meters, a decrease of 9 centimeters, and the water situation temporarily remained stable.

The Jingjiang Flood Diversion Area is a low-lying area between the south bank of the Yangtze River in Jiangling County, Hubei Province, and the Hudu River and Anxiang River, covering an area of over 920 square kilometers and surrounded by dikes. At its northern end, bordering the Yangtze River, is the Taipingkou floodgate. On the Hudu River at its southern end, there is a control gate to prevent floodwaters from pouring into Dongting Lake during flood storage. The entire project of the flood diversion area was built in two phases in the spring and winter of 1952 and is China's first large-scale modern flood diversion project. The flood diversion area can store more than 5 billion cubic meters of floodwater. In the abnormal situation where the Yangtze River flood exceeds the highest water level in previous years, the flood diversion area intercepts part of the floodwater, which can reduce the threat of floods to the Jingjiang Dike and reduce the amount of floodwater flowing into Dongting Lake from the four rivers south of the Yangtze. This flood diversion is the first time since the completion of the diversion area, and it is planned to temporarily divert a portion of the floodwater to prevent the diversion area from being filled. Before this flood diversion, the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Flood Control Headquarters had thoroughly inspected and reinforced and heightened the dikes in the diversion area. There are still more than 28,000 laborers defending the dikes day and night. The people living in the diversion area were also properly relocated and resettled in advance. Thanks to careful preparation, the work of opening the floodgates for flood diversion proceeded very smoothly.

    减轻洪水对荆江大堤和洞庭湖区的威胁
    荆江分洪区进洪闸开闸蓄洪
    【新华社武汉二十二日电】长江中游的荆江分洪区已在二十二日晨开闸蓄洪。二十二日上午二时十分，长达一千零五十四公尺的太平口进洪闸，在荆江分洪防汛指挥部命令下开闸，长江洪水即经过开启的闸门顺流而入。到上午八时，全闸五十四孔闸门全部开启，洪水以每秒钟五千六百多立方公尺的流量进入分洪区。
    入夏以来，长江中游地带雨量过分集中，长江中游和洞庭湖、鄱阳湖水位普遍高涨，一般都超过了历年最高的洪水位。近来，长江上游的四川地区和三峡一带又连降大雨，上游的洪峰接踵而来，和中游的高水位汇合。荆江的洪水从二十一日下午八时后，每小时以平均六公分的速度上涨，到二十二日晨分洪时，沙市水位已达到四十四点三九公尺，洪水还有猛涨的趋势。因此，洪水严重地威胁着荆江大堤的安全，同时也威胁着洞庭湖区的安全。此时，中南区防汛总指挥部经呈请中央人民政府政务院批准，当即命令荆江分洪防汛指挥部开闸分洪。开闸后，沙市水位当时就停止涨势，二十二日上午十一时，沙市水位已落到四十四点三零公尺，下降了九公分，水势暂时保持平稳。
    荆江分洪区为湖北江陵县长江南岸和虎渡河、安乡河之间的一片洼地，面积九百二十多平方公里，周围有围堤。北端临江为太平口进洪闸，南端虎渡河上，有防止蓄洪时洪水涌入洞庭湖的节制闸。分洪区的全部工程是一九五二年春天和冬天分两期修起来的，是我国第一座规模巨大的现代化分洪工程。分洪区可以蓄纳五十多亿立方公尺的洪水。在长江洪水超过历年最高水位的异常情况下，分洪区拦蓄部分洪水，可减轻洪水对荆江大堤的威胁，减少江南四口注入洞庭湖的洪水量。这次分洪，为分洪区修成后的第一次，拟暂分洪一部分，不使分洪区注满。这次分洪前，荆江分洪防汛指挥部，事先已把分洪区的围堤普遍进行了检查和加固加高，现在还有两万八千多民工在堤上日夜防守着。对居住在分洪区内的人民，事先也作了妥善的迁移和安置工作。由于经过周密的准备，开闸分洪工作进行得很顺利。
