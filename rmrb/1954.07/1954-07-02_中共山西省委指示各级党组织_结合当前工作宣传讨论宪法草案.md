CCP Shanxi Provincial Committee Directs Party Organizations at All Levels
    Combine Current Work with Publicity and Discussion of Draft Constitution
    The Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued instructions to party organizations at all levels throughout the province, requiring that the publicity and discussion of the draft constitution must be combined with and promote current tasks. The instructions require: This publicity and discussion of the draft constitution should be like the general line propaganda, achieving a grand scale, a mighty momentum, making it known to every household and deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. Organize the broad masses of the people to conduct discussions, thereby inspiring the people's political enthusiasm and labor initiative, and promoting the smooth completion of current tasks.
    The instructions pointed out: The period from June to August this year is the busy farming season, and production in industrial and mining enterprises is also very intense. At the same time, it is also necessary to do a good job in wheat procurement and convene people's congresses at the city, county, and provincial levels. Under such circumstances, if there is insufficient understanding of the significance of publicizing the draft constitution and carrying out nationwide discussions, or if sufficient importance is not attached to it, or if it is not well integrated with various tasks, it will inevitably lead to the phenomenon of attending to one thing and losing sight of another. Therefore, the publicity of the draft constitution must be closely integrated with current tasks. The instructions require party organizations at all levels to comprehensively and systematically publicize the basic content of the draft constitution.
    The instructions pointed out: In order to deeply publicize the draft constitution and promote the completion of various tasks, it is necessary to lead and organize powerful work teams to participate in the work. At the same time, under the direct help of cadres going down to factories and villages, a large number of grassroots cadres, propagandists, and activists should be trained to organize a propaganda team of more than one million people from top to bottom to conduct publicity among the masses. All机关 cadres who do not go down to factories and villages should also be organized to publicize to the local people (including family members of 机关 staff). Cadres going down to factories and villages are both propaganda teams and work teams, and should appropriately arrange their work around the central task of industrial and agricultural production. In terms of propaganda steps and methods, publicity should be carried out based on the characteristics of organized masses and the general public, and based on the characteristics of cities, villages, and basic construction sites. It is necessary to be both broad and in-depth, and also not to hinder production. (Xinhua News Agency)

    中共山西省委指示各级党组织
    结合当前工作宣传讨论宪法草案
    中共山西省委员会向全省各级党组织发出指示，要求宪法草案的宣传和讨论必须结合并推动当前各项工作。指示中要求：这次宪法草案的宣传和讨论，要像总路线宣传一样，做到规模壮阔，声势浩大，家喻户晓，深入人心，并组织广大人民进行讨论，从而鼓舞人民群众的政治热情和劳动积极性，推动当前各项工作任务的顺利完成。
    指示指出：今年六月到八月期间，正是农忙季节，工矿企业生产也很紧张，同时还必须作好小麦征购工作和召开市、县和省的人民代表大会会议。在这种情况下，如果对宪法草案的宣传和开展全民讨论的意义认识不足，重视不够，或者和各项工作结合不好，势必造成顾此失彼的现象。因此，宪法草案宣传必须和当前各项工作密切结合起来进行。指示要求各级党的组织应全面地系统地宣传宪法草案的基本内容。
    指示指出：为了深入宣传宪法草案并推动完成各项工作任务，必须有领导地组织强大的工作队参加工作。同时应在下厂、下乡干部的直接帮助下，大批训练基层干部、宣传员和积极分子，自上而下地组织一支一百万人以上的宣传队伍，向群众进行宣传。凡是不下厂、下乡的机关干部，也应组织起来向驻地群众（包括机关工作人员家属在内）宣传。下厂、下乡的干部既是宣传队，又是工作队，都应围绕工业农业生产这一中心任务来适当的安排工作。在宣传的步骤和方法上，应当根据有组织的群众和一般群众的特点，根据城市、农村、基本建设工地的情况和特点等进行宣传，既要做到广泛深入，也要不妨碍生产。　（新华社）
