    Anshan Iron and Steel Works Health Department's Tiedong Outpatient Clinic's Department of Otolaryngology has been using tissue therapy to treat deaf-muteness since the spring of 1953. According to preliminary statistics, the effective rate has reached 24%. For example, Huang Baocheng (eight years old), a family member of an employee, became deaf-mute at the age of three due to convulsive illness. After four treatments, he can now speak generally. Tian Chunbo, the son of Tian Jingshan from the Anshan Iron and Steel Works Transportation Department, could only hear a little before treatment and spoke very unclearly. After one treatment, both ears could hear clearly, and his speech also became clear.

    鞍钢卫生处铁东门诊部
    用组织疗法治聋哑病获得成效
    鞍钢卫生处铁东门诊部耳鼻咽喉科，从一九五三年春季开始用组织疗法治疗聋哑病以来，据初步统计，有效率达百分之二十四。例如职工家属黄宝成（八岁），三岁时因患抽疯病变成聋哑，经过四次治疗，现在已会说一般的话了。鞍钢运输部田景山的儿子田春波，未治疗前只能听到一点声音，说话很不清楚，经过一次治疗以后，双耳都能清楚地听到声音，并且说话也清楚了。
