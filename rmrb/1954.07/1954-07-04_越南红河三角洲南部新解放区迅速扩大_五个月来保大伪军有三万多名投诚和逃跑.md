Xinhua News Agency, July 3rd: A dispatch from Vietnam News Agency on July 3rd reports: The new liberated areas in the southern Red River Delta now include all of Nam Định and Ninh Bình provinces, nearly all of Thái Bình province, and most of Hà Nam province. This is a rich granary, with an area of 4,000 square kilometers and a population of over 2 million. The newly liberated city of Nam Định is one of the three largest cities in North Vietnam, and the Nam Định textile factory is the largest textile factory in Indochina.

Now, a large swathe of land from Quảng Bình province near the Sino-Vietnamese border up to Hưng Yên and Hải Dương along the Lục Giang River has been completely liberated.

In the history of the French colonialists and American interventionists' aggression against Indochina, this is a heavy blow to them. They have been forced to withdraw from the densely populated and resource-rich southern Red River Delta region, which was previously the place where they relied on implementing the "using war to support war" and "using Vietnamese to fight Vietnamese" plans. The imperialists also intended to turn the Bùi Chu and Phát Diệm areas into "autonomous states" to sow discord between Catholic and non-Catholic people.

Xinhua News Agency: A Vietnam News Agency report: "Voice of Vietnam" recently reported detailed information about the French army's withdrawal from the Độ Đầu area in Hà Đông province, saying that due to the liberation of the Độ Đầu area, the liberated area here has been extended to the banks of the Đáy River, only ten kilometers away from Hà Đông city. The Độ Đầu area was occupied by the enemy during the peace campaign that began in the autumn and winter of 1951. The enemy had established a defensive system along Highway 21, relying on the border between Hòa Bình and Hà Đông provinces, from Độ Đầu to Xuân Mai. The enemy's intention at the time was to "pacify" Chương Mỹ and Mỹ Đức districts, and to establish a safe area to protect Hanoi and Hà Đông city, while threatening the liberated areas of Interzone III.

Xinhua News Agency, July 3rd: A dispatch from Vietnam News Agency on July 3rd reports: On June 16th, 23rd, and 29th, the Vietnamese People's Army shot down two French B-26 bombers and one dive bomber in the northwestern region of Vietnam.

Xinhua News Agency, July 3rd: According to Vietnam News Agency reports: There have been numerous incidents of Bảo Đại puppet troops defecting, deserting, and refusing to fight. According to incomplete statistics, from December 19, 1953, to May 19, 1954, 35,873 puppet troops defected to the Vietnamese People's Army or deserted.

In the area on the right bank of the Red River, 5,150 puppet troops deserted or defected to the People's Army in the first three months of this year. From April 6th to 21st, three companies of puppet troops refused to go to Điện Biên Phủ. In Nam Định province, from April 26th to May 7th, incidents of puppet troops defecting to the People's Army occurred every day. A platoon belonging to the 712th Light Battalion of the puppet army brought their weapons and defected to the People's Army side.

In the area on the left bank of the Red River, incidents of puppet troops refusing to participate in "mopping-up" operations or refusing to go to reinforce enemy troops in other strongholds have occurred repeatedly. In Hải Phòng, 150 puppet troops disobeyed orders to "mop up" the Vĩnh Bảo area. In Hải Dương province, puppet troops have repeatedly refused to go to reinforce enemy troops in critical situations. In the second half of April, 139 puppet troops deserted from the enemy ranks in Thái Bình province.

In South Vietnam, incidents of Bảo Đại puppet troops deserting and surrendering have also continued to occur. More than 10,000 puppet troops defected to the People's Army in three months. In April, 2,500 soldiers from 17 puppet army battalions stationed in South Vietnam deserted with their weapons.

In the Fourth Interzone in northern Central Vietnam, over 2,000 puppet troops deserted in the first three months of this year. After 2,500 puppet troops of the Fifth Interzone in southern Central Vietnam collapsed in January and February, more serious desertions occurred in mid-May. In just a few days, 300 soldiers from the 607th puppet army battalion deserted.

    越南红河三角洲南部新解放区迅速扩大
    五个月来保大伪军有三万多名投诚和逃跑
    【新华社三日讯】据越南通讯社三日讯：红河三角洲南部的新解放区现在包括南定省和宁平省的全部，太平省的将近全部和河南省的大部分。这是一个富饶的谷仓，面积四千方公里，人口二百多万。新解放的南定城是北越三个最大的城市之一，南定的纺织工厂又是印度支那最大的一个纺织工厂。
    现在，从中越的广平省上至禄江沿岸的兴安和海阳的一大块土地都已完全解放。
    在法国殖民者和美国干涉者侵略印度支那的历史上，这是对他们的一次沉重的打击。他们被迫从人口稠密、资源丰富的红河三角洲南部地区撤退，这里就是他们以前赖以实行“以战养战”和“用越南人打越南人”的计划的地方。帝国主义还曾打算把裴朱和发艳地区变为“自治邦”以在天主教和非天主教人民之间散布不和。
    【新华社讯】越南通讯社消息：“越南之声”最近报道法军从河东省渡头地区撤退的详细情况说，由于渡头地区的解放，这里的解放区已伸展到带河边，离河东城只有十公里。渡头地区是在一九五一年秋冬开始的和平战役中被敌人攻占的。敌人曾沿着第二十一号公路，靠着和平省与河东省边界建立了一个从渡头到春梅的防御体系。敌军当时的企图是“平定”章美和美德两县，并设立一个安全地带来掩护河内与河东城，同时威胁第三联区的解放区。
      【新华社三日讯】越南通讯社三日讯：越南人民军在六月十六日、二十三日和二十九日在越南西北地区击落法军B—二十六型轰炸机两架和俯冲轰炸机一架。
    【新华社三日讯】据越南通讯社消息：保大伪军投诚、逃跑和拒绝作战的事件众多。据不完全统计，从一九五三年十二月十九日到今年五月十九日，有三万五千八百七十三名伪军投向越南人民军或开了小差。
    在红河右岸地区，今年头三个月有五千一百五十名伪军开了小差或投向人民军。四月六日到二十一日，曾有三连伪军拒绝开往奠边府。在南定省，从四月二十六日到五月七日，每天都发生伪军向人民军投诚的事件。属于伪军第七一二轻装营的一排人带了武器投奔到人民军方面来。
    在红河左岸地区，伪军拒绝参加“扫荡”或拒绝前往增援其它据点的敌军的事件屡次发生。海防有一百五十名伪军不服从“扫荡”永保地区的命令。海阳省的伪军曾多次拒绝前去增援处境危急的敌军。在四月份的下半月，太平省有一百三十九名伪军逃离了敌军队伍。
    在南越，保大伪军开小差和投降的事件也不断发生。在三个月中共有一万多名伪军投向人民军。在四月份，驻南越的十七个伪军营中就有两千五百人带着武器开了小差。
    在中越北部第四联区，今年头三个月共有二千多名伪军开了小差。中越南部第五联区的伪军在一、二月中溃散了二千五百人后，在五月中旬更发生了严重的逃跑事件，仅伪军第六零七营在几天中就逃跑了三百人。
