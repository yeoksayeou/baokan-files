    Many factory workers in Wuhan are overcoming difficulties and persisting in production amidst intense flood control efforts. State-owned Wuhan No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory, the jointly state-private Hankou No. 1 Textile Company, the jointly state-private Yuhua Yarn Factory, Wuhan Oil Factory, and Wufeng Flour Mill, among others, have exceeded their June production plans.

    Since the beginning of summer, the Wuhan area has experienced heavy rainfall, and the Yangtze River water level has continued to rise. Waterlogging in the city cannot be drained quickly, and factories in low-lying areas along the river are threatened by flooding. To ensure the normal progress of industrial production, under the leadership of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, many factories established flood control headquarters in late June. Some neighboring factories established joint flood control headquarters. Each factory adopted various flood control measures based on its specific circumstances. The state-owned Wuhan No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory and Hanyang Lumber Processing Factory, along with one other neighboring factory, jointly constructed a 2,300-meter-long flood control dike in front of and on both sides of the three factories. More than 1,600 workers, family members, and nearby residents from the three factories participated in this intense battle day and night. Hankou No. 1 Textile Company, Yuhua Yarn Factory, and Zhenhuan Yarn Factory reinforced their existing flood control walls. Many workers and technicians in these factories voluntarily worked two hours of unpaid overtime each day, outside of their regular production hours, to participate in digging and carrying earth. Shenxin Yarn Factory, Fuxin Flour Mill, and Wuhan Automobile Parts Factory, which are located in low-lying areas with more water accumulation, also jointly prepared twenty water pumps for drainage, thus eliminating the threat of waterlogging. Factories also took many measures to protect machinery and warehouses. Some factories purchased a large quantity of tallow and applied it to the main components of the machines to prevent them from becoming damp and rusty. Amidst the intense flood control efforts, the factories also overcame many difficulties to ensure production. For example, because some personnel and transportation equipment were diverted for flood control needs, the workers demonstrated even greater enthusiasm to ensure the normal supply of materials and production.

    武汉市许多工厂在紧张的防汛中坚持生产
    武汉市许多工厂职工在紧张的防汛工作中，克服困难坚持生产。国营武汉第一棉纺织厂、公私合营汉口第一纺织公司、公私合营裕华纱厂、武汉油厂、五丰面粉厂等单位并超额完成了六月份生产计划。
    入夏以来，武汉地区多雨，长江水位不断上涨，市内积水不能迅速排泄，沿江沿河低洼地带的工厂受到洪水的威胁。为了保证工业生产的正常进行，在中共武汉市委员会的领导下，六月下旬许多工厂都成立了防汛指挥部，有些相邻的工厂成立了联合防汛指挥部。各厂根据具体情况，采取了各种防汛措施。国营武汉第一棉纺织厂和汉阳制材加工厂等三个邻近的工厂，联合在三厂的门前和两侧修筑了一条长达二千三百多公尺的防水堤，三个厂的职工、家属和附近居民等一千六百多人日夜紧张地参加了这一战斗。汉口第一纺织公司、裕华纱厂、震寰纱厂加固了原有的防水围墙。这些工厂中许多工人和技术人员都自动在每天的生产时间外，义务劳动两小时，参加挖土挑土。地势低洼积水较多的申新纱厂、福新面粉厂、武汉汽车配件制造厂也联合起来准备了二十部抽水机排水，这样就免除了积水的威胁。在机器和仓库的保护方面，各厂也采取了许多措施。有的厂买了许多牛油涂抹在机器的主要机件上，防止机器受潮生锈。在紧张的防汛工程中，各厂还克服了许多困难保证生产。例如因为防汛需要，调走了一些人员和运输工具，职工们就发挥了更高的积极性，保证了材料供应和生产的照常进行。                       （新华社）
