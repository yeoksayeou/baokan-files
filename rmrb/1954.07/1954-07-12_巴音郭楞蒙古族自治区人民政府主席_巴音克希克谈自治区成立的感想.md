Following the establishment of the Bayingolin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture, Bayinkexike (Mongol nationality), Chairman of the Autonomous Prefecture People's Government, shared his thoughts on the establishment of the autonomous region with a Xinhua News Agency reporter. Bayinkexike said: I deeply feel that in the big family of the motherland, all ethnic groups are as closely united as brothers. This is a happiness that money cannot buy, and this happiness has only been available since liberation. After liberation, we have had the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and the help of our Han brothers. Han cadres left their hometowns and came to our pastoral and rural areas, living in tents, drinking milk, learning our language and writing, and serving our ethnic minorities with all their hearts. In the several years since liberation, the various ethnic groups in the autonomous region have become increasingly united, and the people of all ethnic groups have realized that everyone is a master of the People's Republic of China. People's representatives of all ethnic groups often gather together to discuss everyone's affairs. With such unity, things can be done well. For example, all ethnic groups in the Bayingolin area have their own cadres. There are more than 80 Mongol cadres alone serving in important positions such as county heads, section chiefs, and district heads in the government system. I have also grown up under the cultivation of the Communist Party. Many of us are already glorious Communist Party members.

Bayinkexike said: What is especially gratifying is that under the leadership of the Communist Party and with the help of our Han brothers, the economic and cultural outlook of our autonomous region has undergone significant changes. Hejing County and Yanqi Hui Autonomous County in the autonomous region used to be grain-deficient areas in Xinjiang. The grain produced each year was not enough for half a year's needs. Since 1952, they have not only been completely self-sufficient, but also have surplus grain. Herdsmen brothers in pastoral areas can also eat flour. Since liberation, the number of horses, cattle, sheep and other livestock in the Bayingolin area has increased by 400,000, and the livestock are safe. We now have eight more primary schools than in the early days of liberation, and the number of students has increased by more than 70 percent. In 1951, there were only 18 Mongol students in the local secondary schools, but now there are nearly 100. Literacy classes are held on the grasslands, and more people are becoming literate. There are three hospitals in the entire region to treat diseases for people of all ethnic groups, and the population is also thriving. At the first People's Representative Conference of the Autonomous Region, two of the three Mongol female representatives from Hoshut County came with their babies in their arms. Seeing these scenes makes people feel happy from the bottom of their hearts. We know that this is given by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao.

Bayinkexike said: The unity of our various ethnic groups has taken a big step forward in the preparation for the establishment of the Bayingolin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture. The people of all ethnic groups have promoted the spirit of unity and mutual assistance, and ethnic groups with small populations enjoy equal rights. For example, ethnic minorities such as the Kazakh and Manchu, who are very small in number in the autonomous region, also had their own representatives attending the meeting and participating in the election, and everyone was very satisfied. People of all ethnic groups reflect: the autonomous region is our home, and we have a responsibility to build it. District and township cadres also said: These are all victories of Chairman Mao's policy of national regional autonomy.

Bayinkexike concluded his conversation by saying: With the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the autonomous region will further consolidate the close unity of all ethnic groups, actively develop agricultural and pastoral production, support the country's industrial construction, and the people of our autonomous region will also move from backwardness to advancement along with the people of the whole country, and gradually transition to a socialist society. The people of all ethnic groups in our Bayingolin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture sincerely thank the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. I myself will follow Chairman Mao's instructions and be a faithful servant of the people of all ethnic groups, and serve the people of all ethnic groups.

    巴音郭楞蒙古族自治区人民政府主席
    巴音克希克谈自治区成立的感想
    巴音郭楞蒙古族自治区建立后，自治区人民政府主席巴音克希克（蒙古族）向新华社记者畅谈对自治区成立的感想。巴音克希克说：我深深感到，在祖国大家庭里，各民族像兄弟一样的亲密团结，这是一种千金难买的幸福，这种幸福是解放以后才有的。解放以后，我们有了中国共产党和毛主席的领导，有了汉族老大哥的帮助。汉族干部离开他们的家乡，到了我们的牧区和农村，住帐篷，喝奶子，学习我们的语言文字，忠心为我们少数民族服务。自治区内各民族解放后几年来日益团结了，各民族人民都认识了大家都是中华人民共和国的主人。各民族人民代表常常聚在一起讨论大家的事务，有了这样的团结，事情就都办好了。比如，巴音郭楞地区各民族都有了自己的干部，只蒙古族干部就有八十多名在政府系统担任县长、科长、区长等重要职务。我也是在共产党的培养下成长的，我们里面有不少人已是光荣的共产党员。
    巴音克希克说：尤其可喜的是：在共产党的领导下，在汉族老大哥的帮助下，我们自治区的经济、文化面貌都有了显著的变化。自治区内的和靖县和焉耆回族自治区，过去是新疆的一个缺粮地区，每年出产的粮食不够半年的需要，从一九五二年起，不但完全自给，而且还有余粮。牧区里的牧民兄弟们也可以吃到面粉。解放以来，巴音郭楞地区马、牛、羊等各种牲畜，增加了四十万头，牲畜都平安。我们现有的小学校比解放初期增加了八所，学生人数增加了百分之七十以上。一九五一年在本地中级学校里的蒙古族学生只有十八名，现在快要有一百名了。草原上办有识字班，识字的人也多了起来。全区有三所卫生院，为各族人民治疗疾病，人口也兴旺了。这次开自治区首届人民代表会议，和硕县的三个蒙古族女代表，有两个就是抱着小娃娃来的，见了这些情景，叫人从心里感到高兴。我们知道这是共产党和毛主席给的。
    巴音克希克说：我们各族人民的团结，在这次筹备建立巴音郭楞蒙古族自治区当中，又向前走了一大步。各族人民发扬了团结互助的精神，人口少的民族一样也享受着平等权利。例如：在自治区内人数很少的哈萨克族、满族等兄弟民族，也有自己的代表出席会议，参加了选举，大家都很满意。各族人民反映：自治区就是我们的家，我们有责任建设它。区乡干部也说：这些都是毛主席民族区域自治政策的胜利。
    巴音克希克在结束他的谈话时，说道：我们有中国共产党和毛主席的领导，今后自治区将更加巩固各民族的亲密团结，积极发展农、牧业生产，支援祖国工业建设，我们自治区的人民也就会和全国人民一道，由落后到先进，逐步过渡到社会主义社会。我们巴音郭楞蒙古族自治区各族人民衷心感谢共产党，感谢毛主席。我自己将遵照毛主席的指示，做一个各族人民忠实的勤务员，为各族人民服务。
