Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, July 21st: Indian public opinion circles expressed warm welcome to the news of the signing of the Indochina ceasefire agreement, which arrived in Delhi on the night of the 20th.

All the newspapers in Delhi carried this news on the front page on the 21st with banner headlines. The "Hindustan Times" and the "Indian Express" had banner headlines saying: The Indochina War is about to end. The "Hindustan Standard" had a banner headline saying: "Peace Comes to Indochina."

The "Hindustan Times" Geneva dispatch of July 20, under the headline "Negotiation Triumphs Over War," said: "These are the great significance of the signing of the Indochina ceasefire agreement, a major world event. This event will be recorded in history under the title of 'July 20, 1954 - Geneva.'" The dispatch also said: "The road to creating peace through negotiation has finally been found."

The "Statesman" Geneva dispatch of July 20 said: "The restoration of peace in Indochina after fifty-six days of erratic negotiations (the last ten days being particularly tense) should be truly satisfying to India."

The "Indian Express" wrote: "Official sources in New Delhi have expressed great relief and satisfaction at the realization of the Indochina armistice; the same feeling of great relief and satisfaction will be felt throughout India."

The "New India Times" commented in an editorial: "For all these reasons, the Indochina ceasefire will bring a sense of joy and satisfaction everywhere."

All the newspapers praised the efforts of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to restore peace in Indochina. They said: Without their efforts in Geneva to overcome obstacles and insist on a peaceful resolution to the Indochina issue, the ceasefire agreement would not have been reached. "Mr. Zhou Enlai and Mr. Nehru's recent meeting undoubtedly had a beneficial influence in this regard."

    印度舆论欢迎印度支那停火
    【新华社新德里二十一日电】印度支那停火协定缔结的消息二十日夜到达德里后，印度舆论界表示热烈欢迎。
    德里所有的报纸在二十一日都在首页以通栏标题刊载了这一消息。“印度斯坦时报”和“印度快报”的通栏标题说：印度支那战争就要结束了。“印度斯坦旗报”的通栏标题说：“和平到了印度支那”。
    “印度斯坦时报”七月二十日的日内瓦电讯在“协商战胜战争”的标题下说：“这些就是印度支那停火协定的签订这一巨大世界性事件的重大意义。这一事件将要在‘一九五四年七月二十日——日内瓦’的题目下载入史册。”这一电讯又说：“通过协商缔造和平的道路终于找到了。”
    “政治家报”七月二十日的日内瓦电讯说：“经过五十六天变幻无常的谈判（最后十天特别紧张）而恢复的印度支那和平，应该能够使印度真正感到满意。”
    “印度快报”写道：“新德里官方人士对印度支那停战的实现，都表示十分宽慰和满意；印度各地也将同样感到十分宽慰和满意。”
    “新印度时报”在社论中评论说：“为了这一切原故，印度支那的停火将给一切地方带来欣愉和满意的感觉。”
    各报都对苏联、中华人民共和国和越南民主共和国恢复印度支那和平的努力表示赞扬。它们说：如果没有它们在日内瓦克服障碍和坚持和平解决印度支那问题，停火协议原是不会达成的。“周恩来先生和尼赫鲁先生最近的会晤无疑地在这一方面起了有益的影响。”
