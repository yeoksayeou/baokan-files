    Futziling Reservoir Begins Large-Scale Flood Storage, Blocking the Torrential Pi River Waters

   [This newspaper report] The Futziling Reservoir, located in the upper reaches of the Huai River, has begun large-scale flood storage, with the massive multiple-arch dam blocking the second-largest flood in the Pi River's recorded history. Recently, continuous heavy rainfall occurred in the upper reaches of the Pi River, leading to mountain torrents and a surge in the reservoir's upper reaches from 85 meters to 112.6 meters. However, due to the obstruction of the multiple-arch dam, the water level in the reservoir's lower reaches is only 80.2 meters. This represents a difference of 32.4 meters compared to the upper reach level of 112.6 meters. Consequently, the farmland on both banks of the Pi River has not suffered from flooding, and crops are growing well.

    佛子岭水库开始大量蓄洪挡住淠河大水
   【本报讯】淮河上游的佛子岭水库开始大量蓄洪，高大的连拱坝挡住了淠河有水文纪录以来的第二次大洪水。近来，淠河上游连续暴雨，山洪暴发，水库上游的淠河水位由八十五公尺上涨到一百一十二点六公尺。但是由于连拱坝的阻拦，水库下游的水位，只有八十点二公尺，和上游一百一十二点六公尺的水位比较，相差三十二点四公尺。因此，淠河两岸的农田没有受到水灾，庄稼生长很好。
