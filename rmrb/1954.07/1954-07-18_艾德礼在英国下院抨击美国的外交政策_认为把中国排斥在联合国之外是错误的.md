Xinhua News Agency, July 17th dispatch from London: A debate on foreign policy was held in the British House of Commons on July 14th. Labour Party leader Clement Attlee spoke first, criticizing various aspects of American foreign policy.

He expressed his unease about certain trends within the United States, especially since these trends or opinions seemed to be strongly held by those in responsible positions. These trends could be found in the Senate and were not entirely absent in the government. Attlee said, "The United Nations is composed of countries with various different ideas and concepts." However, "There is a rather powerful group in the United States that considers the United Nations mainly as a tool for an anti-communist ideological war." He also said that a considerable portion of people on the other side of the Atlantic held the idea of "eradicating communism by force."

Attlee said: "The Labour Party is anti-communist like the United States... but we are in favor of peaceful coexistence."

He continued: "Everyone hopes that the Geneva Southeast Asia conference will be successful and thus resolve the Indochina issue. The opposition recognizes the dangers in this situation and has praised the efforts made by the Foreign Secretary." He expressed regret over Dulles's avoidance of the Geneva Conference.

He hoped the problem could be resolved. He continued: "We must admit that even if we can achieve a situation of stasis or ceasefire in Indochina, the very difficult Korean problem still exists." He said: "The solution to this problem is very closely linked to China's seat on the Security Council and the Taiwan issue." He expressed dissatisfaction with Churchill's statement that this issue was not specifically discussed at the Washington conference. He stated that he felt a little uneasy when the Prime Minister said this. He had thought that "no matter what method is used to try to solve the Southeast Asia problem, those participating in the talks should have been thinking about this problem at all times." He said: "The opposition Labour Party believes that excluding China from the United Nations is wrong, unwise, and contrary to the principles of the United Nations."

Attlee said he acknowledged that "the United States feels deeply because it suffered significant losses in Korea." He said: "Some impatient people still want to wage war against Communist China and want Chiang Kai-shek to be restored. This idea, from a military point of view, is foolish, and from a political point of view, it ignores the fact that every revolution is consolidated by foreign attack - the French and Communist Russian revolutions are prominent examples. Here you see a revolutionary government that undoubtedly has the support of the masses, and the reason for this is obvious."

Attlee said: "The Communists defeated Chiang Kai-shek and drove him to Taiwan. The Chinese believe that Taiwan is Chinese territory, and it has been part of China for centuries. Without foreign aid from the United States, Chiang Kai-shek's rule in Taiwan would have been over long ago. A comparison is worthwhile: Suppose that during a revolution in the United States, General Burgoyne had not surrendered at Saratoga but had been driven to Long Island, and a European country opposed to the Republican government had supplied him with weapons and a fleet to prevent the Americans from pursuing him. If so, Washington and his friends would not have considered this a very friendly act."

Attlee said: "What hinders the problem from reaching a general solution is the Taiwan issue and the United Nations seat issue." He said: "How strongly the Americans feel about the seat issue. There is no doubt that they bear obligations to Chiang Kai-shek. But Chiang Kai-shek is now aging, and he commands old and weak soldiers. It is time for these leaders to receive their pensions and retire. Then their subordinates will be happy to return to China."

Attlee advocated seeking a comprehensive solution. He said: "Unless we consider long-term policies, there will be no easy solution... When seeking a comprehensive solution, the Colombo Conference countries can provide important assistance." Attlee believed that the Chinese revolution "won great sympathy from the Asian people." But when mentioning the solution to the Taiwan issue, Attlee departed from history and reality. Attlee clearly knew that Taiwan has been an integral part of Chinese territory since ancient times, but he put forward the idea of placing Taiwan under UN trusteeship, which is obviously unacceptable to the Chinese people. Attlee also repeated the old tune of so-called Chinese "aggression" in his speech.

Attlee said: "China asked for Russian aid. It asked for recent aid, which is very natural in times of difficulty. The United States felt very gratified that Republican France gave it aid during the revolution." Attlee argued that "we must break away from the usual background and look at all these issues objectively. The reason why the Chinese Communists have been successful is because they have raised living standards. It seems that they have united the peasants and intellectuals to their side."

Speaking of the West European issue, he accused the United States of adopting coercive measures towards West European countries. He said: "The opposition strongly opposes the use of force at any time, threatening some countries with financial losses. It is not a good thing to say that if certain countries do not ratify the European Defence Community treaty, they will stop giving them American aid. This is like an old-fashioned stern father saying to his son: 'Unless you marry the girl I choose, I won't give you any money.' This has greatly angered people on this side of the Atlantic - indeed, it can be said to be everywhere."

Attlee criticized the American aggression against Guatemala. He said: "The fact is, this is a blatant act of aggression." He said that he was quite shocked by the American Secretary of State's elation over the success of the coup. He said: "I am afraid the Guatemala incident has left a rather unpleasant impression."

When talking about the hydrogen bomb issue, Attlee said: This is indeed still a "threat hanging over all of civilization." He continued:
"I am sure the Prime Minister has discussed this issue with President Eisenhower. I think now is the time to discuss this issue with Mr. Malenkov, if such an arrangement can be made. I am sure there is no benefit to delaying this matter."

### 艾德礼在英国下院抨击美国的外交政策  认为把中国排斥在联合国之外是错误的

    艾德礼在英国下院抨击美国的外交政策
    认为把中国排斥在联合国之外是错误的
    【新华社十七日讯】伦敦消息：英国下院在七月十四日举行了外交问题辩论，工党领袖艾德礼首先发言，他抨击了美国外交政策的各个方面。
    他表示对于美国国内的某些趋势感到不安，特别是因为这些趋势或者说意见似乎是负责的人士所强烈怀有的。这些趋势可以在参议院中找到，在政府中也并非完全没有。艾德礼说，“联合国是由具有各种不同思想观念的国家组成的。”可是，“在美国有一帮相当有势力的人认为联合国主要是一个反共的思想战的工具。”他还说，在大西洋彼岸有相当大一部分人抱有“以武力铲除共产主义政策”的想法。
    艾德礼说：“工党和美国一样反共……但我们赞成和平共处。”
    他接着说：“大家都希望日内瓦的东南亚会议成功，并从而解决印度支那问题。在野党认识到在这个局势中的危险，并曾赞扬过外交大臣所作的努力。”他对杜勒斯规避日内瓦会议一事表示遗憾。
    他希望问题可以求得解决。他继续说：“我们必须承认，纵然我们能够在印度支那取得一种静止局面或停战，但非常困难的朝鲜问题仍然存在。”他说：“这个问题的解决是和中国在安全理事会的席位和台湾问题十分紧密地连结在一起的。”他对邱吉尔所说的在华盛顿会议中并没有特别谈到这个问题表示不满。他表示当首相这样说时，他感到有点不安。他本来以为，“不论用什么办法来试图解决东南亚问题，那些参加会谈的人应该什么时候都想到这个问题。”他说：“在野工党认为，把中国排斥在联合国之外是错误的、不智的，而且是和联合国的原则相违背的。”
    艾德礼说，他承认“美国由于在朝鲜遭到了重大损失而感触很深”。他说：“有些性急的人仍然想对共产党中国进行战争，想让蒋介石复辟。这种想法，从军事方面说，是愚蠢的，从政治方面说，它忽视了一切革命由于外来攻击而巩固起来的事实——法国和共产党俄国的革命是突出的例子。这里你看到的是一个革命政府，毫无疑问，它是得到人民群众的支持的，其所以如此，原因是明显的。”
    艾德礼说：“共产党击败了蒋介石，把他赶到了台湾。中国人认为台湾是中国的领土，而且数世纪来它一直是中国的一部分。如果没有美国的外来援助，蒋介石在台湾的统治早就完蛋了。作一个对比是值得的：假定在美国发生革命时，布戈尼将军没有在萨拉脱加投降，而被赶到了长岛上，当时某个反对共和政体的欧洲国家，供给他武器和舰队来阻止美国人追击他，如果这样，华盛顿和他的朋友就不会认为，这是一种非常友好的行动。”
    艾德礼说：“阻碍问题获得总的解决的是台湾问题和联合国席位问题。”他说：“美国人对于席位问题的感觉是如何的强烈。没有疑问，他们对蒋介石担负着义务。但是蒋介石现已日渐衰老，而且他指挥的是老弱残兵。现在是这些领袖们领受养老金退休的时候了。那时他们的部下就会乐得回中国去。”
    艾德礼赞成谋求全面的解决。他说：“除非我们考虑长远政策，就不会有轻而易举的解决办法……。在谋求全面的解决办法的时候，科伦坡会议国家能给予重要的协助。”艾德礼认为中国革命“博得了亚洲人民很大的同情。”但在提到台湾问题的解决办法时，艾德礼却离开了历史和现实。艾德礼明明知道台湾自古以来就是中国领土的一部分，却提出了显然为中国人民所决不能同意的把台湾交由联合国托管的意见。艾德礼还在演说中重复了所谓中国“从事侵略”的老调。
    艾德礼说：“中国曾要求俄国援助。它要求最近的援助，在困难的时候这是很自然的。美国在革命的时候，对于共和法兰西给予援助感到非常欣慰。”艾德礼主张“必须从通常的背景下脱身出来，客观地来看所有这些问题，中国共产党人所以得到成功是由于他们提高了生活水平。看来，他们已经把农民和知识分子团结到他们方面去。”
    谈到西欧问题时，他指责了美国对西欧国家采取胁迫的手段。他说：“反对党强烈反对在任何时候用武力，以财政上的损失来威胁一些国家。说如果某些国家不批准欧洲防务集团条约就停止给予它们美援，那不是一件好事情。这样的话就活像旧式的严峻的父亲对儿子说：‘除非你娶我挑选的女孩子，否则我就不给你钱用。’这样使大西洋这一边的人——的确也可说是各地的人——大为愤慨。”
    艾德礼抨击美国对危地马拉的侵略事件。他说：“事实是，这是一个一目了然的侵略事件。”他说，美国国务卿对这次政变成功的兴高采烈的情绪使他感到颇为震惊。他说：“我恐怕危地马拉事件已经给人们留下一个颇不愉快的印象。”
    在谈到氢弹的问题时，艾德礼说：这的确还是一个“悬在整个文明头上的威胁”。他接着说：
  “我确信首相曾和艾森豪威尔总统讨论过这个问题。我认为，假如能做这样的安排的话，现在就是和马林科夫先生讨论这个问题的时候了。我确信，推迟这件事情是没有好处的。”
