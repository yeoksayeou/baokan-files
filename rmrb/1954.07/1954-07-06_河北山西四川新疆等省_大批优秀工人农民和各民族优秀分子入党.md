Large numbers of outstanding workers and peasants have joined the Chinese Communist Party in Hebei, Shanxi, and Sichuan provinces in recent years. From July of last year to June of this year, CCP organizations at all levels in Hebei Province admitted more than 48,000 outstanding workers and peasants into the Party, including some excellent teachers and students. In the first half of this year, more than 10,000 industrial and agricultural labor models and outstanding individuals joined the Chinese Communist Party in Shanxi Province. From July 1953 to May of this year, Sichuan Province admitted more than 1,100 outstanding employees into the Chinese Communist Party.

Most of these new Party members are activists who emerged in industrial production, labor competitions, and the rural mutual aid and cooperation movement. Among the 411 outstanding workers, engineers, and technicians recently admitted to the Party by the CCP organizations at all levels in Shijiazhuang, 90 had been selected as labor models, and many had been commended and awarded more than three times. Li Fenglan, a national textile industry labor model and female worker at the Tangshan Huaxin Textile Factory, joined the Chinese Communist Party in June of this year. According to statistics from seven special districts including Handan, Tongxian, and Tangshan in Hebei Province, among the 14,163 new Party members developed in the first quarter of this year, there were 2,762 members of agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams. After joining the Party, these new Party members were able to work with veteran Party members to closely connect with the masses and play a leading and exemplary role in production and work. Liu Linhu, a fitter in the coking department of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, put forward 14 rationalization proposals last year, enabling the completion of the maintenance and repair tasks of 13 major equipment items ahead of schedule. In the first half of this year, he created five new equipment and tools and taught 12 new apprentices simple drawing techniques, which played a certain role in the development of the technical innovation movement in the coking department. Yao Qinglan, a new Party member and electric furnace steelmaking worker, often promoted to the workers after studying the General Line: "The factory is our home, and the working class must strive for communism for the rest of their lives." He also took the lead in learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in production, creating a new record for the life of a certain electric furnace wall, increasing it from 60 times in the past to 127 times. In Sichuan Province, many new Party members in various factories and mines have been rated as labor models or advanced producers. Among the municipal labor models selected in Chengdu this year, there are 45 Party members. Yuan Zhixian, a Chengdu municipal special-class labor model, lathe operator, and Communist Party member in a certain factory, actively learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet high-speed cutting method and organized a technical promotion mutual aid group among lathe operators in his factory, increasing the cutting speed from 700 revolutions per minute to 920 revolutions per minute. After he served as the leader of the Chengdu Technical Promotion Group in 1953, he helped some major factories in the city modify 80% of their lathes and promoted the Kolesov lathe tool method, which increased work efficiency by four times. Under the leadership of the Party, Cao Tongyi in Jin County, Hebei Province, united the farmers of Zhoujiazhuang to embark on the road of collectivization. Now the agricultural production cooperative in this village uses tractors to cultivate the land. Yang Shijun, Yao Fenglan, and Xi Shulan, new Party members in Xizhanggeng Township, Jie County, Shanxi Province, were elected as the heads and deputy heads of the agricultural production cooperative branch. Together with the original 40-odd Party members in the township, they led the township to overfulfill the task of purchasing surplus grain and mobilized 360 households to join the agricultural production cooperative.

Many outstanding members of various ethnic groups in Xinjiang Province have joined the Chinese Communist Party. According to statistics at the end of 1953, more than 6,400 new Party members had been admitted in the past four years. Among them, Party members of various ethnic groups such as Uygur, Kazakh, Hui, Mongolian, Kirgiz, Uzbek, Tatar, Xibe, Russian, Tajik, and Manchu accounted for 75.68% of the total number of new Party members. Under the leadership of the Party, these new Party members have been tempered in their work over the past few years, and have closely united with the Han Party member cadres from outside, becoming the leading backbone among the people of all ethnic groups. According to statistics at the end of 1953, local ethnic minority Party members accounted for 26.1% of the members of Party committees at all levels above the county level.

Many of these new Party members were originally members of the Communist Youth League and learning and working models. Among the 619 new Party members in Xinjiang provincial-level and Urumqi municipal-level organs, 340 were originally members of the Communist Youth League. Among the 34 new Party members developed in the second phase of Party building in Urumqi in 1953, 24 were labor models and outstanding workers.

The vast majority of new Party members developed in rural areas were activists who emerged during the rent reduction and land reform movements. They were able to closely connect with the masses and were supported by the masses. These new Party members in rural areas became the leading backbone of the Party in rural areas. In the general election, 63% of the new Party members were elected as representatives to the county and township people's congresses, and many of them were also elected as members and heads/deputy heads of the township people's government. The vast majority of rural Party members participated in mutual aid and cooperation organizations, promoting the development of mutual aid and cooperation organizations. According to the understanding of 18 agricultural production cooperatives, there are 35 Party members who have joined the cooperatives, and 12 of them serve as heads and deputy heads of the cooperatives.

    河北山西四川新疆等省
    大批优秀工人农民和各民族优秀分子入党
    河北、山西、四川三省近年来有大批优秀的工人和农民加入中国共产党。从去年七月到今年六月，中共河北省各级组织共吸收了四万八千多个优秀工人、农民入党，其中包括部分优秀的教职员、学生。山西省今年上半年有一万多名工业、农业劳动模范和优秀分子加入中国共产党。四川省从一九五三年七月到今年五月，就有一千一百多名优秀职工成为中国共产党党员。
    这些新党员大部分都是在工业生产，劳动竞赛和农村互助合作运动中涌现出来的积极分子。中共石家庄各级组织最近接收入党的四百一十一名优秀工人，工程技术人员中，有九十人曾被选为劳动模范，不少人曾立功受奖在三次以上。全国纺织工业劳动模范、唐山市华新纺织厂女工李凤兰已在今年六月参加了中国共产党。据河北省邯郸、通县、唐山等七个专区的统计，今年第一季度发展的一万四千一百六十三名新党员中，就有农业生产合作社的社员和互助组组员二千七百六十二人。这些新党员在入党后，都能和老党员一道，密切联系群众，在生产和工作中起带头和模范作用。太原钢铁厂炼焦部钳工刘林虎去年曾提出十四件合理化建议，使十三项主要设备的维护检修任务全部提前完成。今年上半年他又创造了五种新设备和新工具，还教会了十二个新徒工掌握简单的绘图技术，对炼焦部技术革新运动的开展起了一定作用。新入党的电炉炼钢工人姚青兰学习总路线后，经常向工人宣传：“工厂就是咱们的家，工人阶级要为共产主义奋斗一辈子。”他并在生产中带头学习苏联先进经验，创造了某号电炉炉墙寿命由过去六十次提高到一百二十七次的新纪录。四川省各厂矿中，已有许多新党员被评为劳动模范或先进生产者。今年成都全市被评选的市级劳动模范中就有党员四十五人。成都市特等劳动模范、某厂车工、共产党员袁志先，积极学习苏联高速切削法的先进经验，在本厂车工间组织技术推广互助组，使车速由每分钟七百转提高到每分钟九百二十转。一九五三年他担任成都市的技术推广组组长后，帮助全市一些主要工厂改装了百分之八十的车床，推广了科列索夫车刀法，使工作效率提高四倍。河北省晋县曹同义在党的领导下，团结周家庄全村农民走上合作化的道路，现在这村的农业生产合作社已用拖拉机耕地。山西省解县西张耿乡新党员杨士俊、姚凤兰、席淑兰被选为农业生产合作社分社的社长和副社长。他们和这个乡原有的四十多个党员一道，带动全乡超额完成余粮收购任务，并带动三百六十户农户参加了农业生产合作社。　（新华社）
    新疆省各民族中有许多优秀分子加入了中国共产党。到一九五三年年底的统计，四年来吸收的新党员已有六千四百多名。其中维吾尔、哈萨克、回、蒙、柯尔克兹、乌兹别克、塔塔尔、锡伯、俄罗斯、塔吉克、满等各民族的党员占新党员总数的百分之七十五点六八。这些新党员在党的领导下，几年来在工作中受到了锻炼，并和外来汉族党员干部紧密团结，成为各族人民中的领导骨干。根据一九五三年年底的统计，县级以上中国共产党各级党委委员中，本地各民族党员占百分之二十六点一。
    这些新党员中，有许多原来都是青年团员和学习、工作模范。新疆省级及乌鲁木齐市级机关六百一十九名新党员中，原来是青年团员的占三百四十名，乌鲁木齐市一九五三年第二期建党发展的三十四名新党员中，有二十四名是劳动模范和优秀工作者。
    在农村中发展的新党员，绝大多数都是在减租和土地改革等运动中涌现出来的积极分子。他们能够密切联系群众并为群众所拥护，这些农村中的新党员，成为党在农村中的领导骨干。在普选中有百分之六十三的新党员当选为县、乡人民代表大会的代表，其中有不少人还当选为乡人民政府委员和正副乡长。绝大多数的农村党员都参加了互助合作组织，推动了互助合作组织的发展。据十八个农业生产合作社的了解，入社的党员有三十五名，其中担任正副社长的有十二名。　（新华社）
