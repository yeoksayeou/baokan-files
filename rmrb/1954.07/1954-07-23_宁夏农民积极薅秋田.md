Farmers in various parts of Ningxia Province have attached particular importance to field management of rice, millet, and sorghum crops. As of now, the second weeding of approximately 600,000 mu of rice fields and the first hoeing of all millet and sorghum fields in the province have been basically completed. Farmers in various places are beginning the third weeding of rice and the second hoeing of millet and sorghum, in conjunction with the intense summer harvest preparations.

This year, because of the promotion of early rice planting in various places, the weeding date is generally earlier than in previous years. In this way, farmers in various places, especially agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams, have more sufficient manpower and time to improve field operations for rice, millet, sorghum, and other crops. It is expected that the third weeding task of rice can be basically completed when the summer harvest begins generally throughout the province.

Many agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams have applied fertilizer in the paddy fields in combination with the first and second weedings. Feng Jinxiao and Wei Lingyun, from the 26 mutual aid teams in the 7th Township of Zhongning 6th District, launched a fertilizer application competition with each other. Feng Jinxiao's mutual aid team mobilized both male and female members to use the method of pulling bitter bean plants and hauling sheep manure from the mountains, enabling the whole team to apply more than 11,000 jin of bitter beans and two carts of sheep manure to all 44 mu of rice. Under the impetus of the mutual aid teams, farmers throughout the township pulled more than 142,000 jin of bitter beans, and more than 570 mu of rice were fertilized.

Farmers have completed the first weeding in hundreds of thousands of mu of millet, sorghum and other miscellaneous grain fields, and have begun the second weeding. Individual farmers in the dry mountain areas have also used mountain water to irrigate dry land crops in order to ensure a good harvest of millet and sorghum.

    宁夏农民积极薅秋田
    宁夏省各地农民特别重视了水稻和糜、谷等作物的田间管理工作。截至目前为止，全省六十万亩左右的水稻第二遍薅草和所有糜、谷的头遍锄草已基本结束。各地农民正结合紧张的夏收准备工作，开始水稻的第三遍薅草和糜、谷的第二遍锄草。
    今年因为各地提倡了水稻早播，所以薅草日期普遍比往年提早，这样各地农民特别是农业生产合作社、互助组，就有更充足的人力和时间，来提高水稻、糜、谷等作物的田间作业。预计全省夏收普遍开始的时候，基本上可完成水稻的第三遍薅草任务。
    有不少农业生产合作社、互助组，结合头二遍薅草，分别在稻田里施了追肥。中宁六区七乡冯进孝、魏凌云等二十六个互助组，互相展开了追肥竞赛，冯进孝互助组发动男女组员，用拔苦豆子和到山里拉羊粪的办法，使全组四十四亩水稻追上了一万一千多斤苦豆子和两车羊粪。在互助组的带动下，全乡农民拔了十四万二千多斤苦豆子，有五百七十多亩水稻上了追肥。
    农民在数十万亩糜、谷等杂粮田中，已锄完第一遍草，并开始锄第二遍。个别山旱地区的农民，为了保证糜、谷丰收，还利用山水灌溉了旱地庄稼。
