    On July 6, Nam Il, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, issued a statement summarizing the discussions on the Korean issue at the Geneva Conference. In this statement, Foreign Minister Nam Il not only provided a comprehensive and detailed exposition of the discussions on the Korean issue at the Geneva Conference, but also emphasized that the issue of Korean reunification still requires continued efforts and negotiations through consultation to seek a solution. This powerfully expresses the Korean people's firm and unremitting will to strive for peaceful national reunification.

    After the Korean armistice, the convening of the Geneva Conference provided the possibility of seeking a peaceful resolution to the Korean issue through consultation. The people of Korea and China, and peace-loving people around the world, had hoped that the Geneva Conference would reach an agreement on a peaceful resolution to the Korean issue based on guaranteeing the national and democratic rights of the Korean people, so that Korea could restore its unity and ease international tensions. However, due to the willful sabotage of the United States and its followers, the Geneva Conference failed to accomplish this task.

    Despite this, the discussions on the Korean issue at the Geneva Conference still have positive significance. It is universally acknowledged that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, China, and the Soviet Union, in line with their consistent policy of peacefully resolving the Korean issue, made the greatest efforts at the Geneva Conference to achieve the peaceful reunification of Korea and consolidate peace in Korea. The peaceful efforts of the three countries were particularly clearly manifested in a series of reasonable and practically feasible proposals put forward by the delegations of the three countries at the conference. These suggestions included: the plan proposed by the delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on "restoring the national unity of Korea and holding free all-Korean elections" and the plan "on guaranteeing the state of peace in Korea"; the suggestion put forward by the delegation of the People's Republic of China on establishing a neutral nations supervisory commission to assist and supervise all-Korean elections; and the five-point proposal put forward by the Soviet delegation to reach agreements on various matters that had been unanimously agreed upon during the discussion process at the conference. These proposals not only provided an immutable foundation for achieving the peaceful reunification of Korea and consolidating peace in Korea, but also affirmed the common points of views of all parties in the discussion process, thereby demonstrating the spirit of consultation among Korea, China, and the Soviet Union in seeking agreement. Even at the last meeting, when the United States was determined to break the negotiations, the delegations of Korea, China, and the Soviet Union unanimously advocated that the conference should adopt a declaration in which the participating countries expressed their willingness to jointly maintain peace in Korea, as well as a proposal for continued efforts in the future to resume negotiations on the Korean issue. Anyone can see how sincere the wishes of Korea, China, and the Soviet Union were for maintaining peace in Korea and peacefully resolving the Korean issue.

    It is worth pointing out the significant role played by the delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in the Geneva Conference in the process of discussing the Korean issue. As Foreign Minister Nam Il pointed out in his statement: "The consistent position of the delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has always been that a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue must conform to the interests of the Korean people and the peace-loving people of the world, and that the Korean issue is a matter for the Korean people themselves. Therefore, the cause of peacefully unifying Korea on a democratic basis must be left to the Korean people themselves." The various proposals put forward by the delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea at the Geneva Conference fully embodied this just position and received the full support and broad sympathy of China, the Soviet Union, and all peace-loving people around the world. The outstanding efforts made by the delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to strive for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue demonstrated the peaceful aspirations of the Korean people, who had already stood up, and their firm confidence in restoring national unity and safeguarding national sovereignty.

    However, the United States delegation adopted a completely opposite position, and what it cared about was fundamentally not the unity of Korea, nor the consolidation of peace in Korea. From the very beginning of the Geneva Conference, the United States was determined to obstruct the Geneva Conference from promoting the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue to any extent. It rejected all reasonable demands and suggestions put forward by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, China, and the Soviet Union at the conference, without putting forward any plan that could show its sincerity in reaching an agreement. The United States delegation insisted on opposing the withdrawal of American troops from South Korea, was fundamentally unwilling to hold truly free elections in North and South Korea, and let the Korean people themselves decide on the issue of their country's unification. At the same time, it brazenly refused to jointly undertake obligations with relevant countries to guarantee the peaceful development of Korea. The American delegation, which feared international consultation, was so unreasonable that it hastily opposed even the proposal made by our Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai at the end, hoping that the countries participating in the Geneva Conference would continue their efforts to resolve the Korean issue through consultation. In this way, the United States disregarded the universal desire of the people of the world for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and the power of morality, and completely sabotaged the negotiations on the Korean issue at the Geneva Conference.

    The reason why the United States so stubbornly refused to resolve the Korean issue through consultation is by no means accidental. As Foreign Minister Nam Il pointed out in his statement on July 6: This is "because they are afraid that if this conference leads to a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, they will not be able to turn the Korean people into their colonial slaves, and their attempts to divide Korea for a long time and provoke new war adventures will be completely bankrupted, and international tensions will be eased, so that American monopoly capitalists will not be able to obtain high profits in the arms race."

    Facts show that the American ruling clique, which refuses to resolve the Korean issue through consultation, is moving towards a new path of military adventure. One of the purposes of General Van Fleet's recent activities in the Far East is to expand the Rhee Syngman puppet army on a larger scale, strengthen the American military deployment in South Korea, and threaten and undermine peace in Korea and the Far East. Encouraged by the United States, the Rhee Syngman clique openly clamored that the Korean Armistice Agreement had "expired" and demanded that a "decisive battle" be carried out in Korea as soon as possible. This shows that American imperialism and its running dog, the Rhee Syngman clique, are attempting to invade the Democratic People's Republic of Korea again and re-ignite the Korean War.

    It is worth noting that after the United States sabotaged the negotiations on the Korean issue and was blamed by the broad masses of people, it could not give any reason to defend its crimes. At the same time, it stubbornly stated that it did not intend to resume the discussion of the Korean issue, attempting to block the road to seeking a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue through consultation, in order to maintain the tense situation in the Far East. This attitude of the United States is extremely arrogant and unreasonable, and it is also unworkable.

    Although the discussions on the Korean issue at the Geneva Conference were interrupted due to the sabotage of the United States and its followers, the Korean issue has not been erased from the agenda of international consultation. As Foreign Minister Nam Il correctly pointed out, although the Geneva Conference was unable to complete the task of peacefully resolving the Korean issue assigned to it, the discussions on the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue at the Geneva Conference have achieved certain results. Because the process of the Geneva Conference proved that it is entirely possible to reach an agreement on the discussion of certain basic issues on the Korean issue. The constructive proposals put forward by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Soviet Union, and the People's Republic of China at the Geneva Conference on the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue have deeply penetrated people's hearts, and world public opinion believes that these proposals provide a reasonable basis for resolving the Korean issue. The International Conference for Relaxation of Tension held in Stockholm in mid-June reflected the strong desire of peace-loving people around the world to resume discussions on the Korean issue. The resolution passed by the conference emphasized that the interrupted negotiations on the Korean issue should be resumed as soon as possible. British Foreign Secretary Eden also declared in the British House of Commons on June 23: "We have not reached an agreement on the unification of Korea, but the proposal to continue negotiations is still valid." Therefore, the United States' attempt to obliterate the Korean people's national desire for peaceful reunification and evade a peaceful negotiated resolution of the Korean issue is absolutely impossible.

    Korea must transition from a state of armistice to a state of peace, and must achieve peaceful reunification on a democratic basis. The Korean people have the strength to realize their national aspirations. The Korean people not only defeated the American aggressors in the anti-aggression war of more than three years, but also the Democratic People's Republic of Korea immediately turned to peaceful construction after the Korean armistice. This will continuously strengthen the democratic base of Korea and become a powerful force for realizing the peaceful reunification of Korea and maintaining peace in Korea. As Foreign Minister Nam Il solemnly declared in his statement: "We are convinced that the unanimous wishes and resolute struggle of all the Korean people who yearn for the peaceful reunification of their motherland, with the support of the peace-loving people of the world, will remove the temporary barriers between North and South Korea. The possibility of unifying our motherland will surely be sought through mutual rapprochement and mutual consultation." This firm will of the Korean people cannot be stopped by any force.

    The Chinese people fully support the Korean people's desire to strive for peaceful national reunification; we will continue to carry out the just movement of resisting America and aiding Korea, and work together with the Korean people to guarantee peace in Korea and promote the peaceful reunification of Korea.

### 朝鲜人民争取国家和平统一的意志

    朝鲜人民争取国家和平统一的意志
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相南日于七月六日就总结日内瓦会议关于朝鲜问题的讨论发表了声明。在这个声明中，南日外务相除了对日内瓦会议关于朝鲜问题的讨论作了全面而详尽的阐述之外，并强调指出朝鲜的统一问题今后仍需继续努力，以协商的方法进行谈判来求得解决，这有力地表达了朝鲜人民争取国家和平统一的坚强不懈的意志。
    在朝鲜停战后，日内瓦会议的召开曾为以协商方法谋求和平解决朝鲜问题提供了可能性。朝、中人民和全世界爱好和平的人民，都曾期望日内瓦会议能够在保证朝鲜人民的民族和民主权利的基础上对和平解决朝鲜问题达成协议，使朝鲜能够恢复统一，并缓和国际紧张局势。但是，由于美国及其追随者的恣意破坏，日内瓦会议未能完成这个任务。
    尽管这样，日内瓦会议关于朝鲜问题的讨论依然有着肯定的意义。人所共见，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、中国和苏联本着和平解决朝鲜问题的一贯方针，在日内瓦会议上为实现朝鲜的和平统一和巩固朝鲜的和平作了最大的努力。朝、中、苏三国的和平努力特别清楚地表现在三国代表团在会议上所提出的一系列的合理的和现实可行的建议上。这些建议有：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表团所提出的关于“恢复朝鲜的国家统一和举行全朝鲜自由选举”的方案和“关于保证朝鲜的和平状态”的方案；中华人民共和国代表团所提出的关于建立中立国监察委员会以协助和监察全朝鲜选举的建议；苏联代表团所提出的为使在会议的讨论过程中已经一致同意的各项达成协议的五点建议。这些建议不但提供了实现朝鲜的和平统一和巩固朝鲜和平的不可更易的基础，并且肯定了在讨论过程中的各方意见的共同之点，从而表现出朝、中、苏三国谋求协议的协商精神。甚至在美国决心破裂谈判的最后一次会议上，朝、中、苏三国代表团还曾一致主张会议应该通过与会各国表示愿意共同维持朝鲜和平的宣言，以及今后继续努力以求恢复朝鲜问题的谈判的建议。任何人都可以看出，朝、中、苏三国对于维护朝鲜的和平以及和平解决朝鲜问题是怀着何等真诚的愿望。
    值得指出的是，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表团在日内瓦会议关于讨论朝鲜问题的过程中所起的重大作用。正如南日外务相的声明中所指出的：“朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表团始终如一坚持着的立场是：和平解决朝鲜问题必须符合朝鲜人民和世界爱好和平人民的利益，朝鲜问题是朝鲜人民自己的事情。因此，在民主的基础上和平统一朝鲜的事业，必须交给朝鲜人民自己。”朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表团在日内瓦会议上提出的各项建议，完全体现了这种正义的立场，并得到了中、苏两国及全世界一切爱好和平人民的全力支持和广泛同情。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表团为争取和平解决朝鲜问题所作的卓越努力，表现了已经站了起来的朝鲜人民的和平愿望和对于恢复国家统一和维护民族主权的坚强的信心。
    但是，美国代表团却采取了截然相反的立场，它所关心的根本不是朝鲜的统一，也不是朝鲜和平的巩固。美国从日内瓦会议一开始就下定决心阻挠日内瓦会议在任何程度上促进朝鲜问题的和平解决。它在会议上拒绝了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、中国和苏联所提出的一切合理主张与建议，而又不曾提出任何可以表明它有达成协议诚意的方案。美国代表团坚持反对美国军队撤出南朝鲜，根本不愿意南北朝鲜举行真正自由的选举，由朝鲜人民自己来决定自己国家统一的问题，同时又悍然拒绝和有关国家共同承担义务保证朝鲜的和平发展。害怕国际协商的美国代表团竟然无理到这样程度，它对我国周恩来外长最后提出的希望日内瓦会议与会国家继续努力以期协商解决朝鲜问题的建议，也慌忙地加以反对。这样，美国就不顾全世界人民要求和平解决朝鲜问题的普遍愿望和道义力量，而把日内瓦会议关于朝鲜问题的谈判完全破坏了。
    美国所以这样顽固地拒绝协商解决朝鲜问题，绝对不是偶然的。正如南日外务相在七月六日的声明中所指出：这是“因为他们害怕如果这一会议使朝鲜问题得到和平解决，将不能把朝鲜人民变为他们的殖民地奴隶，使他们的长期分裂朝鲜和挑起新战争冒险的企图完全破产，并会使国际紧张局势得到缓和，使美国垄断资本家不能在军备竞赛中获取高额的利润。”
    事实表明，拒绝协商解决朝鲜问题的美国统治集团，正在朝着新的军事冒险的道路走去。最近美国将军范佛里特到远东来进行活动的目的之一，就是要更大规模地扩充李承晚傀儡军队，加强美国在南朝鲜的军事布置，威胁和破坏朝鲜及远东的和平。在美国的鼓励下，李承晚集团公然叫喊朝鲜停战协定已经“失效”了，而要求尽快地在朝鲜进行
  “决战”。这就表明美国帝国主义及其走狗李承晚集团，正在企图再度进犯朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，重新挑起朝鲜战争。
    值得注意的是，美国在破坏了朝鲜问题的谈判并遭到广大人民指责之后，不能举出任何理由来为它的罪行申辩，同时却死硬地表示不打算再恢复讨论朝鲜问题，企图就这样堵死以协商方法谋求和平解决朝鲜问题的道路，以保持远东的紧张局势。美国的这种态度是极端横蛮无理的，同时也是行不通的。
    日内瓦会议关于朝鲜问题的讨论虽然由于美国及其追随者的破坏而中断了，然而朝鲜问题并没有从国际协商的日程上抹掉。正如南日外务相所正确指出的，日内瓦会议虽然没有能够完成赋予它的和平解决朝鲜问题的任务，但是日内瓦会议关于和平解决朝鲜问题的讨论，已取得了一定的成果。因为，日内瓦会议的过程证明了朝鲜问题上某些基本问题的讨论达成协议是完全有可能的。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、苏联和中华人民共和国在日内瓦会议上就和平解决朝鲜问题所提出的建设性的建议已深入人心，世界舆论认为这些建议为解决朝鲜问题提供了合理的基础。六月中旬在斯德哥尔摩举行的缓和局势国际会议，就曾反映出全世界爱好和平人民要求恢复讨论朝鲜问题的强烈愿望。会议所通过的决议强调，应当尽快恢复已经中断了的朝鲜问题的谈判。英国外交大臣艾登六月二十三日在英国下议院中也曾宣称：“我们没有就统一朝鲜问题达成协议，但是关于继续进行谈判的建议仍然是有效的。”因此，美国想抹煞朝鲜人民要求和平统一的民族愿望，逃避和平协商解决朝鲜问题，是绝对办不到的。
    朝鲜必须由停战状态转入和平状态，必须在民主的基础上达到和平统一。朝鲜人民有力量实现自己的民族愿望。朝鲜人民不但在三年多的反侵略战争中打败了美国侵略者，并且朝鲜民主主义人民共和国在朝鲜停战后立即转入和平建设，这将使朝鲜的民主基地不断加强，而成为实现朝鲜的和平统一和维护朝鲜和平的强大力量。正如南日外务相在他的声明所郑重申明的：“我们确信：渴望祖国和平统一的全体朝鲜人民的一致愿望和坚决的斗争，受着全世界爱好和平的人民的声援，将除掉南北朝鲜之间的暂时性的障壁。必将以相互接近和相互协商的方法寻求到统一我们祖国的可能性。”朝鲜人民的这种坚强意志，是任何力量所不能阻挡的。
    中国人民完全支持朝鲜人民争取国家和平统一的愿望；我们将以继续进行抗美援朝的正义运动，与朝鲜人民一道为保证朝鲜的和平和促进朝鲜的和平统一而共同努力。
