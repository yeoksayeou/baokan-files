    People in cities such as Tianjin, Shenyang, and Wuhan warmly welcomed the agreement reached on the issue of ceasefire and restoration of peace in Indochina.
    The news of the successful conclusion of the Geneva Conference aroused heartfelt joy and celebration among the broad masses of people in Tianjin. The news spread to the state-owned Tianjin Steel Plant, Tianjin Paper Mill, state-owned Tianjin First, Second, Third, and Sixth Cotton Textile Factories, and basic construction sites. Workers read newspapers and discussed the matter. Zhang Yuzhen, a worker at the Second Cotton Textile Factory, said, "The success of the Geneva Conference is the success of the diplomatic policy of the peace and democracy camp. Not only are we happy about this, but I think peace-loving people all over the world will be happy." Worker Zhang Yuting said, "To consolidate the peaceful results achieved at this conference, we must do a good job in competition and improve product quality. Because the strengthening of the motherland's construction will add strength to peace."
    Sang Xiuru, the wife of Tianjin's outstanding artist and martyr Chang Baokun, who now works at the Tianjin Fifth District United Obstetrics Hospital, said after hearing the news: In order for our children to grow up happily, we must be vigilant against the warmongers.
    Li Zizhun, a student of the Textile Specialization Department of Tianjin University, is an overseas Chinese who returned from Vietnam. He grew up in Vietnam and witnessed with his own eyes the great victory of the national liberation movement led by President Ho Chi Minh. He said very happily: "The reason I am happy is not only because my home and my mother are still in Vietnam, but also because this is a victory for peace and a victory for the spirit of consultation."
    The heads of local organizations of various democratic parties and people's organizations in Tianjin also published talks in the "Tianjin Daily", celebrating the agreement reached on the issue of ceasefire and restoration of peace in Indochina. Li Zhuchen, the Chinese representative who returned from the International Conference for Relaxation of Tensions in Stockholm, said: "The agreement reached at the Geneva Conference on restoring peace in Indochina shows the strength of the forces of peace. I personally participated in the International Conference for Relaxation of Tensions in Stockholm, and deeply realized the firm will of the people all over the world to urgently demand peace and oppose war, and deeply felt that the forces of peace are growing rapidly."
    The people of Shenyang city were overjoyed by the agreement reached on the issue of ceasefire and restoration of peace in Indochina. The Shenyang People's Broadcasting Station and cultural centers, cinemas, and theaters throughout the city used loudspeakers to broadcast this good news to people from all walks of life. The printing workers of the Northeast Daily and the Shenyang Daily, who stayed up all night, excitedly and nervously typeset 50,000 copies of extra editions. Mobile floats carrying the extra editions were immediately met with cheering crowds, who eagerly scrambled to read the news that marked the great victory of the forces of peace.
    The Shenyang State-owned Seventh Rubber Factory convened a forum on the twenty-second, bringing together veteran workers, advanced producers, and demobilized soldiers. Li Guiying, an advanced female worker who won the first prize for increasing production and practicing economy in 1953, said at the meeting: "The people of Indochina are going to live in peace, and I am happy for them. How much the people yearn for peaceful days!" Convalescent members of the Chinese People's Volunteers who were gloriously wounded on the Korean battlefield while defending and striving for peace also celebrated the success of the Geneva Conference. Huang Xinchu, who won the third-class merit on the Korean battlefield, said: "This agreement on the restoration of peace in Indochina once again shows the unparalleled strength of the forces of peace. However, US imperialism is still actively carrying out various conspiracies, and we must maintain a high degree of vigilance and be ready to crush any enemy conspiracy at any time."
    The news of the successful conclusion of the Geneva Conference and the agreement on the Indochina peace issue aroused great joy among the people of Wuhan. On the twenty-second, when the Hubei Daily and the Yangtze River Daily issued extra editions carrying this good news, workers, students, soldiers, and people from all walks of life rushed to buy them, and everyone excitedly talked about this "good news of the victory of peace." Construction worker Chen Runkun, who did not know many characters, also bought a copy and asked someone to read it to him. Pumping station worker Xuan Runqing, who was participating in the flood control struggle, expressed the same view, saying: We workers should use our efforts to build the motherland to consolidate this victory. Wang Huizhong, a female student from Wuhan First Normal School who participated in flood control, excitedly bought a large stack of newspaper extra editions for her classmates, shouting: This victory was not easy to achieve, and it is a sign of the strength of the forces of peace. Gao Shangyin, a professor at Wuhan University, said: The achievements of the Geneva Conference are great. The agreement on the Indochina peace issue shows that the United States is even more isolated.
    The local organizations of the various people's organizations and democratic parties in Wuhan issued statements, expressing full support for the agreements reached at the Geneva Conference; unanimously supporting the speech made by Premier and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai at the closing of the Geneva Conference; and particularly feeling satisfied and excited about the outstanding achievements and increased international prestige of our country's diplomatic work, as well as its influence in international affairs.

    天津市优秀的艺术家常宝堃烈士的妻子桑秀茹，现在在天津市第五区联合产科医院工作，听到这一消息后，她表示：为了孩子们幸福地成长起来，我们对战争贩子要保持警惕。
    天津大学纺织专修科学生李子准是从越南回国的华侨。他生长在越南，亲眼看见过越南人民在胡志明主席领导下，取得了民族解放运动的伟大胜利。他非常高兴地说：“我高兴的原因，不仅是我的家和我的母亲还在越南，而且因为这是和平的胜利，协商精神的胜利。”
    天津市各民主党派、人民团体地方组织的负责人，也纷纷在“天津日报”上发表谈话，欢庆印度支那停战和恢复和平的问题达成协议。从斯德哥尔摩参加缓和局势国际会议归来的中国代表李烛尘说：“日内瓦会议上达成了恢复印度支那和平的协议，这显示了和平力量的强大。我亲身参加了斯德哥尔摩缓和局势国际会议，深切体会到全世界人民迫切要求和平、反对战争的坚决意志，并深深感到和平力量正在飞速壮大。”
    沈阳市人民为印度支那停战和恢复和平问题达成协议而欢欣鼓舞。沈阳人民广播电台和全市各文化馆、电影院、剧院，都用广播器向各界群众传播了这个喜讯。东北日报社、沈阳日报社整夜未眠的印刷工人兴奋紧张地排印了五万份号外。装载着号外的流动彩车每到一个地方，人群立即沸腾起来，兴奋地争着阅读这个标志和平力量取得巨大胜利的消息。
    沈阳国营第七橡胶厂在二十二日下午召开了老工人、先进生产者和转业军人的座谈会，曾经荣获一九五三年增产节约一等奖的先进女工李桂英在会上说：“印度支那人民将要过和平生活了，我为他们高兴。人民多么渴望和平的日子啊！”曾经为保卫和平、争取和平而在朝鲜战场上光荣负伤的中国人民志愿军休养员们，也都欢庆日内瓦会议的成功。曾在朝鲜战场上立过三等功的黄新渠说：“这次印度支那恢复和平问题达成协议，再一次显示了和平力量的强大无比。但是，美帝国主义还在积极进行种种阴谋活动，我们一定保持高度警惕，随时准备粉碎敌人任何阴谋。”
