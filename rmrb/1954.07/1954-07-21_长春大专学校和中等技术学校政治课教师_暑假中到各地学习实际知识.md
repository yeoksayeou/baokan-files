    Political Teachers from Changchun Colleges and Technical Schools
    Study Practical Knowledge in Various Places During Summer Vacation
    More than one hundred young political teachers from sixteen colleges and technical schools in Changchun City are using their summer vacation to study practical knowledge in various places in order to effectively improve and enhance political teaching. Led by relevant responsible persons from the Propaganda Department of the Changchun Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, these young teachers arrived in the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Region of Jilin Province in early July. Through discussions and visits with members of the Liming Collective Farm and personnel from better agricultural producers' cooperatives and mutual aid teams, they learned about the socialist transformation of agriculture. They will also go to Tianjin to visit some state-capitalist enterprises to understand the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce. Finally, they will go to Beijing to have discussions with political teachers from Peking University, Tsinghua University, and some technical secondary schools to learn and exchange political teaching experiences.

    暑假中到各地学习实际知识
    长春市十六所大专学校和中等技术学校的一百多名政治课青年教师利用暑假到各地学习实际知识，以便有效地改进和提高政治课的教学工作。这些青年教师在中共长春市委员会宣传部有关负责人员率领下，已在七月初到达吉林省延边朝鲜族自治区。他们通过和黎明集体农庄的庄员以及较好的农业生产合作社、互助组的人员座谈访问，学习了有关对农业进行社会主义改造的知识。他们还要到天津去参观一些国家资本主义企业，了解对资本主义工商业进行社会主义改造的情况。最后，还要到北京和北京大学、清华大学及部分中等技术学校的政治课教师进行座谈，学习和交流政治课教学经验。
