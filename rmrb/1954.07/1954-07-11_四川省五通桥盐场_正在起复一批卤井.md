    Sichuan Province Wutongqiao Saltworks
    Is Reviving a Batch of Brine Wells
    The Wutongqiao Saltworks in Sichuan is reviving a batch of brine wells. Since construction began in mid-March, eighteen wells have been completed and put into production, and sixteen wells have completed the initial wood and bamboo engineering work. According to plan, a total of fifty-one wells can be revived by the end of the year, and the increased salt production can supply 600,000 people for a year.
    The edible salt produced by the Wutongqiao Saltworks not only supplies the people of Leshan, Yibin, and other regions, as well as Yunnan, Xikang, and Guizhou, but also supports industrial and agricultural production. This year, 4,000 dan of barium-containing salt have been supplied to the Yibin Tianyuan Chemical Plant, and have been shipped monthly according to contract since March. The byproduct of salt, gypsum, is supplied to agricultural production; in high-altitude cold regions, it can maintain soil temperature in winter, exert soil effectiveness in spring, and also prevent pests.

    四川省五通桥盐场
    正在起复一批卤井
    四川五通桥盐场正在起复一批卤井。自三月中旬动工以来，到目前已有十八眼井完工投入生产，十六眼井完成了抢下木竹工程。按计划，到年底共能起复五十一眼井，增产的盐可供六十万人食用一年。
    五通桥盐场所产食盐不仅供乐山、宜宾等专区和云南、西康、贵州等地人民食用，还支援了工农业生产。今年供应宜宾天原电化厂的有钡花盐四千担，已自三月份起按合同逐月放运。盐的副产品?巴供给农业生产，对高山冷土地带，冬季可以保持土温，春季能发挥土壤效能，还能防治害虫。
