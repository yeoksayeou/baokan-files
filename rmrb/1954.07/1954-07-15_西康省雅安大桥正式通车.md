    Ya'an Bridge in Xikang Province Officially Opens to Traffic
    The longest modern highway bridge in Xikang Province—the Ya'an Bridge—officially opened to traffic on July 1st.
    The People's Government of Xikang Province began planning the construction of this bridge in 1951 and officially started construction in November 1952. During the construction process, it received assistance from Soviet experts and support from all over the country. Soviet expert Beloborodov personally went to the construction site several times to assist in surveying and offered many valuable suggestions, such as the suggestion to increase the span of the middle arch, which allowed the bridge piers to avoid areas with rapid water flow, reduced construction difficulties, shortened construction time, and greatly saved engineering costs. All the staff responsible for the construction of the bridge, in the face of insufficient equipment and weak technical strength, worked diligently to study and create many advanced tools and working methods, improved work efficiency, and overcame floods, ensuring that the bridge could be opened to traffic on time on July 1st.
    Previously, on the Qiang River, which runs through Ya'an City, there was only an old iron chain bridge that could only be used by pedestrians. Cars and mules had to rely on ferries to cross the river, which was not only time-consuming but also caused ferries to be suspended during floods. This seriously hindered the material exchange in Xikang Province. After the Ya'an Bridge opened to traffic, the trunk lines of the Sichuan-Kang, Kang-Dian, and Kang-Zang highways were directly connected, facilitating transportation in minority areas and the transport of industrial and agricultural products. It will play a certain role in promoting the economic construction of Xikang Province and improving people's lives. At the same time, it connects the north and south banks of Ya'an City into one, which is also conducive to the prosperity of the city.

### 西康省雅安大桥正式通车

    西康省雅安大桥正式通车
    西康省最长的一座现代化公路桥梁——雅安大桥已于七月一日正式通车。
    西康省人民政府为了修建这座大桥，从一九五一年起即开始筹划，在一九五二年十一月正式动工兴修。在修建中，得到了苏联专家的帮助以及全国各地的支援。苏联专家别路包罗多夫几次亲赴工地帮助观测，并提出许多宝贵的建议，如关于加大中间一孔孔距的建议，使桥墩避过了水流较急的地方，减少了施工困难，缩短了施工时间，并大大地节省了工程费用。负责修建该桥的全体职工，在设备不足，技术力量薄弱的情况下，刻苦钻研，创造了许多先进工具和工作方法，提高了工作效率，战胜了洪水，保证了该桥能够在七月一日按时通车。
    以前在横贯雅安市的羌江上面，仅有一座古老的铁索桥，只能供行人往来，汽车、骡马过江全靠船渡，不仅往返费时，而且在洪水期间，渡船还要停航。这就严重地妨碍了西康省的物资交流，雅安大桥通车后，川康、康滇、康藏等公路干线直接衔接起来，便利了少数民族地区的交通，便利了工农业产品的运输，对于促进西康省经济建设的发展和人民生活的改善都将起一定的作用；同时，它把雅安市南北两岸连成一片，又有利于市区的繁荣。
