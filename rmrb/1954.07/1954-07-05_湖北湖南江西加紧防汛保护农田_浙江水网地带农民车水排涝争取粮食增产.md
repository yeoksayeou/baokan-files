Xinhua News Agency: Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi provinces are making urgent flood control efforts. Since the beginning of summer, the middle reaches of the Yangtze River have experienced prolonged periods of overcast and rainy weather, causing the water levels of rivers such as the Han River, Yangtze River, Li River, and Xiu River to rise continuously. Some areas have already experienced mountain floods and waterlogging. Based on past experience, the rainy season in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River in Sichuan mostly occurs in July. If heavy rains arrive in Sichuan in mid- or late July, the water level in the middle reaches will rise further, and the threat of flooding will become more severe. To overcome floods and protect farmland and crops, the vast number of farmers along the rivers in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, under the leadership of local Party and government leading organs, are engaged in a heroic struggle against the floods. At present, various parts of Hubei Province have mobilized the vast number of farmers to actively carry out flood control, and a large number of laborers are rushing to repair dangerous sections found during the general survey of dikes. The commissioner of the Huanggang Special District and responsible cadres from various counties have gone to the most critical parts of the dikes to direct flood control work. Since mid-June, an average of 80,000 people per day in Huangmei County have been working on the dikes. Zhongxiang, Jingmen, Qianjiang, Tianmen, and Mianyang counties have divided the dike lines into sections, assigning them to different districts, and have formulated plans for how many people should work on the dikes at different water levels to ensure that the dikes rise with the water and prevent breaches. Farmers in the lake areas along the Yangtze River in Hunan Province have overcome several consecutive floods this summer. Now, farmers in waterlogged areas are vigorously draining water. Organized farmers along the rivers are patrolling the dikes day and night in shifts, vigilantly monitoring changes in the flood level. In Jiangxi Province, the Gan River, Fu River, and Xiu River areas have experienced continuous rain since the beginning of summer, and the river water has risen successively. When more than a dozen landslides and seepages occurred successively on the dikes in Wannian County on the east bank of Poyang Lake, the Wannian County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the responsible persons of the county and districts led the farmers to brave the wind and rain to reinforce the dikes, and laid soil and turf on the dangerous sections, turning the dikes from danger to safety. At present, people in the lake areas along the rivers in Jiangxi Province are still stepping up their precautions.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 3rd: In the plains of the Hang (zhou) Jia (xing) Hu (zhou) water network area of Zhejiang Province, more than 200,000 organized farmers are now leading individual farmers to pump water and drain flooding day and night with more than 60,000 waterwheels, striving for increased grain production. In late June this year, there was excessive rainfall in the Hangjiahu area, and the rivers rose, causing water to accumulate in many rice fields and unable to drain, resulting in waterlogging. Under the full leadership of the local CCP committees and people's governments, farmers in the flood-affected areas have been organizing drainage forces in a unified manner by village. Agricultural producers' cooperatives and mutual aid teams in the villages generally carry out labor division and field and tool lineups, absorbing individual farmers to participate, and collectively pumping water and draining flooding day and night on the embankments. The mutual aid teams in each village of Baquan Township, Chongde County, have uniformly organized production teams for water pumping, land reclamation, and rice transplanting, quickly draining the accumulated water from more than 2,500 mu of rice fields, plowing and harrowing them, and transplanting rice seedlings. In Guansou Township, Jiashan County, in addition to more than 100 mutual aid teams collectively pumping water and draining flooding, 95 individual farmer households have organized 17 temporary mutual aid teams to collectively drain flooding and rush to plant, enabling more than half of the township's rice fields to be drained in time and planted with seedlings. Farmers in Wuxing County have recently drained the accumulated water from more than 200,000 mu of rice fields and transplanted rice seedlings.
    During the drainage and rush planting, a large number of technicians and workers from cities such as Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou, and many market towns have gone to the countryside to help farmers repair water pumps. Many government cadres, People's Liberation Army soldiers, residents, and students in many towns and cities are organized to go to nearby rural areas to help farmers pump water. In areas that have not been flooded, many farmers are also supporting farmers in neighboring flooded areas to drain flooding and rush to plant.

    湖北湖南江西加紧防汛保护农田
    浙江水网地带农民车水排涝争取粮食增产
    据新华社讯：湖北、湖南和江西等地人民正在作紧急防汛努力。入夏以来，长江中游地带长时间阴雨，汉水、长江、澧水和修河等江河水位不断上涨，部分地区已形成山洪和积水等灾害。根据历年经验，长江上游四川一带雨季多在七月，如果在七月中旬或下旬川江大水到来，中游地带的水位将还要升高，洪水威胁将更形严重。为战胜水患保护农田庄稼，长江中游地带江河沿岸广大农民在当地党政领导机关领导下都正和洪水展开英勇斗争。目前，湖北省各地动员了广大农民积极进行防汛，大批民工正在赶修普查堤防中发现的险工。黄冈专区的专员和各县负责干部都到堤防最危急的各处指挥防汛工作。黄梅县六月中旬以来平均每天有八万人上堤。钟祥、荆门、潜江、天门、沔阳等县把堤线划段分交各区负责，并订出多高水位多少人上堤的计划，以保证水涨堤高防止溃口。湖南省沿江滨湖地区农民已战胜今年夏季连续来临的几次洪水。现在积水地区的农民正大力排除积水；江河沿岸组织起来的农民正日夜轮班巡查堤防，警惕地监视着洪水位的变化。江西省的赣江、抚河和修河等地，入夏以来雨水不断，河水相继上涨。当鄱阳湖东岸万年县的堤防先后有十多处发生脱坡、渗漏等险象时，中共万年县委员会和县、区的负责人领导农民冒着风雨加固堤防，并在各险段上铺上泥土和草皮，使各堤防转危为安。目前，江西省沿江滨湖地区人民仍在加紧防范中。
    据新华社杭州三日电：浙江省杭（州）嘉（兴）湖（州）水网地带的平原上，目前每天都有二十多万组织起来的农民带动单干农民，用六万多部水车日夜车水排涝，争取粮食增产。今年六月下旬，杭嘉湖地区雨水过多，江河水涨，很多稻田积水无法外泄，形成内涝。受涝地区农民在当地中共党委和人民政府的全力领导下，纷纷以村为单位统一组织排涝力量。村里的农业生产合作社和互助组普遍进行劳力分工和田亩、工具排队，吸收单干农民参加，在成片的圩头上日夜集体车水排涝。崇德县八泉乡各村互助组统一组织车水、垦田、插秧等生产队，把二千五百多亩稻田的积水迅速排干，并耕耙好，进行插秧。嘉善县官溇乡除了一百多个互助组集体车水排涝外，全乡又有九十五户单干农民组织了十七个临时性互助组集体排涝抢种，使全乡一半以上稻田及时排出积水插下秧苗。吴兴县农民最近已排出二十多万亩稻田的积水，并插下了秧苗。
    在排涝抢种中，杭州、嘉兴、湖州等城市和许多集镇都有大批技术工人下乡，帮助农民装修抽水机。不少城镇的机关干部、人民解放军、居民和学生，都有组织地到附近农村帮助农民车水。没有受涝的地区，也有许多农民支援邻近的受涝地区农民排涝抢种。
