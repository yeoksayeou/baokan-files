    Doing a Good Job in Grain Transportation is an Important Political Task
    Xing Huan
    In the past two months, we have received letters from some readers reflecting the fact that since the implementation of the "Responsible Transportation System" by the railways, some railway departments have not truly taken responsibility, resulting in accidents such as grain being wet, damaged, soiled, and missing items. According to a letter from the Beijing Grain Bureau's correspondence group: last year, the bureau received grain transported by train from various places, and there were 958 accidents during transportation, of which 633 were rain-related accidents, accounting for 66 percent of the total number of accidents, with a total loss of about 240 million yuan. Although repeated requests have been made to the relevant departments to pay attention to this, it is understood that accidents are still occurring. For example, on June 4, the Xizhimen warehouse under the bureau received 13 trainloads of rice from Guangzhou South Station, of which 11 cars with 111 bags were wet by rain; on June 21, the Dongjiao warehouse received 34 trainloads of glutinous rice from Guangzhou, of which 21 cars were also soaked in rainwater, and the rice temperature was as high as 30 degrees Celsius. Xue Weilin from the Transportation Department of the Liuzhou Railway Administration wrote that from January to May this year, 178 batches of grain, totaling 155,475 kilograms, were wet or damaged after being transferred by stations under the Liuzhou Bureau. According to the materials from the Accident Compensation Section of the Ministry of Railways, in May alone, stations under the Liuzhou, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Zhengzhou, and Jinan Railway Administrations had 186,466 kilograms of grain damaged by moisture.
    Why do these accidents keep happening? In addition to objective reasons such as poor vehicle equipment, damaged tarpaulins on freight cars, and poorly packaged grain, the main reason is that the relevant leading units of the railway departments do not pay enough attention to grain transportation. Grain is a special commodity. If accidents cause losses to grain, it will directly affect the country's grain allocation plan, causing temporary imbalances in supply and demand in some areas. It will also reduce the country's grain reserves, and all of this will affect the national economy, the people's livelihood, and socialist construction. Therefore, grain transportation is by no means a purely business-related task, but a task with great political significance. Due to insufficient understanding of the importance of grain transportation, some cadres responsible for transportation one-sidedly emphasize that "the volume of grain transportation is large, the task is urgent, the equipment is poor, and accidents are inevitable," and do not actively try to prevent or reduce the occurrence of accidents. They lack strict supervision and inspection of the implementation of regulations and systems, and they also lack necessary political education for the employees. Many employees only want to be fast and save trouble when loading and unloading grain, and do not operate in accordance with the regulations, do not pay attention to the protection and safety of grain, and even some stevedores have the economistic idea of "load and unload quickly and get money quickly, regardless of safety."
    The key to doing a good job in grain transportation lies first in making employees fully aware of the political significance of grain transportation and correcting the purely business-oriented view in grain transportation. For example, the employees of Liuzhou North Station used to have the idea of "only caring about transportation and not caring about safety" when it came to grain transportation, and they did not feel sorry when they saw grain scattered on the ground. After studying the Party's general line in the transition period, they understood the relationship between grain and the country's socialist construction, and consciously changed that wrong attitude. In order to prevent grain from being wet, soiled, or damaged, they always thoroughly cleaned the vehicles before loading, and some vehicles were sprinkled with a layer of rice bran after being wiped dry; they also corrected the idea of simply relying on the vehicle inspection station to repair vehicles in the past. When work was busy, the station master and the employees of the freight room and the transportation office took the initiative to help the vehicle inspection personnel repair the vehicles. They also implemented a strict inspection system for tarpaulins, and used different quality tarpaulins according to the nature of the goods. In order to prevent muddy feet from stepping on the grain bags in the car after rain, the stevedores were divided into two groups from the end of November last year, one group specializing in receiving on the car and the other group specializing in sending up from under the car. Due to these efforts, from September last year to March this year, Liuzhou North Station has shipped nearly 10,000 tons of grain. Although the task was heavy, the journey was long, and the equipment was poor, they still achieved safe transportation without any accidents.
    Secondly, in order to do a good job in grain transportation, the carrier and the consignor units must work closely together. For example, Nanning Station of the Liuzhou Bureau and Nanning Grain Company and the directly affiliated grain depot of the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region Grain Bureau signed safety transportation contracts respectively. Nanning Station (i.e., the carrier) guarantees to operate in accordance with the regulations, clean the vehicles thoroughly, and use covered wagons as the main means of loading, with tarpaulins tightly covered and ridged... Nanning Grain Company and the directly affiliated grain depot of the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region (the consignor) guarantee that the grain entering the station is stacked neatly, and that sufficient preparation of rice husks, straw, and other padding is made before loading, and that the number of grain bags is jointly counted to ensure that the loading is not affected by the untimely handling of grain (except in rainy weather), etc. This experience is also very good.
    Now that new wheat has been put on the market, the task of allocation and transportation will be heavier than in the previous period. At the same time, it is also the rainy season with warm and humid weather and frequent sunshine and rain. The safety of grain during transportation should be given high attention by the relevant departments. If there is any negligence, it will cause huge losses to the country's wealth. The railway departments, which are responsible for the heaviest task of grain allocation and transportation (the amount of grain transported by rail nationwide every day is equivalent to the amount transported by all ships and wooden boats nationwide in one month), do a good job in grain transportation, which is of particularly great significance for ensuring the planned supply of grain nationwide. In order to complete the task of grain allocation and transportation in the rainy season, the Central Grain Department issued a "Notice on Strengthening Rainproof and Moisture-proof Work in Grain Transportation in the Rainy Season" on May 24, requiring grain departments at all levels to strengthen the education of employees on cherishing national property, overcome the past idea of simply relying on the railway to be responsible, strengthen political responsibility, and actively cooperate with the railway transportation departments to effectively do a good job in rainproof and moisture-proof work. The Business, Rolling Stock, and Vehicle Bureaus of the Central Ministry of Railways also jointly issued "Measures on Strengthening the Prevention of Rain and Moisture Accidents" on May 30, putting forward six specific measures, requiring railway employees to implement them conscientiously. The Central Grain Department and the Business, Rolling Stock, and Vehicle Bureaus of the Central Ministry of Railways have raised this issue in a timely manner, which is entirely correct; but after the issue is raised, the responsibility of the leading organs lies in mobilizing the employees to implement it conscientiously and organizing effective inspections to ensure the safe transportation of grain.

    做好粮食运输工作是重要的政治任务
    星环
    近两月来，我们收到一些读者来信，反映了自从铁路实行“负责运输制”以来由于某些铁路部门没有真正负起责任而发生的一些粮食湿损、破损、污损和件数不符的事故。据北京粮食局通讯组来信：去年该局接收各地火车运来的粮食，在运输途中发生事故的就有九五八起，其中雨湿事故就有六三三起，占事故总数的百分之六十六，损失共约二亿四千万元。虽经多方提请有关部门注意，但据了解至今事故仍不断发生，如六月四日该局所属西直门仓库接到由广州南站运来大米十三车，其中有十一车一百一十一包遭受雨湿；同月二十一日东郊仓库收到广州粘米三十四车，内有二十一车也为雨水浸湿，米温高达三十度。柳州铁路管理局运输处薛蔚林来信说：从今年一月到五月止，经柳州局所属各站调拨的谷物，发生湿损事故的就有一百七十八批十五万五千四百七十五公斤。又据铁道部事故赔偿科的材料，仅今年五月份一个月柳州、上海、广州、郑州、济南等铁路管理局所属各站，就有十八万六千四百六十六公斤谷物遭受湿损。
    为什么会不断发生这些事故呢？除了车辆设备不良、货车篷布破损、粮食包扎不好等客观原因外，主要是由于铁路部门有关领导单位对运粮工作重视不够。粮食是一种特殊商品，如果因事故使粮食受了损失，就会直接影响国家的粮食调拨计划，使部分地区发生暂时的供求失调现象，同时也减少了国家的粮食储备数量，而这一切都将影响到国计民生和社会主义的建设。所以运粮工作决不是单纯的业务性的工作，而是具有很大政治意义的工作。由于对运粮工作的重要意义认识不足，某些负责运输的干部片面的强调“粮食运量大，任务紧，设备差，事故是难免的”，而不积极设法去防止或减少事故的发生，对规章、制度的执行情况缺乏严格的监督和检查，对职工群众也缺少必要的政治教育。不少职工在装卸粮食时只图快、图省事，不按章作业，不注意粮食的保护和安全，甚至有少数装卸工人中还存在着“快装快卸快拿钱，管他安全不安全”的经济主义思想。
    做好粮食运输工作的关键，首先在于使职工充分认识运粮工作的政治意义，纠正运粮工作中的单纯业务观点。例如柳州北站的职工，过去对运粮工作也存在着“只管运输不管安全”的思想，看见粮食撒满地也不心疼。学习了党在过渡时期的总路线后，知道了粮食和国家社会主义建设的关系，便自觉地改变了那种错误的态度。为了防止粮食湿损、污损、破损，他们在装车前总是彻底地把车辆清扫干净，有的车辆擦干后还撒上一层糠皮；并纠正了过去单纯依赖检车所检修车辆的思想，工作忙时，站长及货房、运转室的职工都主动地帮助检车人员检修车辆。对于篷布也实行了严格的检查制度，并按照货物的性质分别使用不同质量的篷布。为了防止雨后装车泥脚踏脏车内粮包，从去年十一月底起，装卸工人分成两组，一组专在车上接，一组专在车下往上送。由于这些努力，从去年九月到今年三月，柳州北站先后运出粮食近万吨，虽然任务重，路途远，设备差，但他们仍然作到了安全运输，没有发生事故。
    其次，为了做好粮食运输工作，承运和托运单位必须密切配合工作。例如柳州局南宁站与南宁市粮食公司、桂西僮族自治区粮食局直属粮库分别签订了安全运输合同，南宁站（即承运方）保证按章作业，车辆清扫干净，装车时以棚车为主，篷布苫盖严密并起脊……。南宁市粮食公司、桂西僮族自治区直属粮库（托运方）则保证进站粮食堆码整齐，装车前充分准备谷糠、稻草等铺垫，共同清点粮包件数，保证不因粮食搬运不及时而影响装车（雨天例外）等。这个经验也是很好的。
    现在新麦已经上市，调运任务将较前一时期更形繁重，同时又正是气候暖热、忽晴忽雨的多雨季节，粮食在运输途中的安全问题，更应引起有关部门高度的重视，如稍有不慎便会造成国家财富的巨大损失。担任调运粮食任务最重的铁路部门（全国每天经过铁路运输的粮食，相当于全国所有轮船、木船一个月的运输量），做好运粮工作，对保证全国粮食计划供应更具有特别重大的意义。为了完成雨季的粮食调运任务，中央粮食部已于五月二十四日发出“加强雨季粮食运输的防雨、防潮工作”的通知，要求所属各级粮食部门对职工加强爱护国家财产的教育，克服过去那种单纯依赖铁路负责的思想，加强政治责任心，主动配合铁道交通部门，切实做好防雨、防潮工作。中央铁道部商务、车务、车辆三局也于五月三十日联合发出了“关于加强防止雨湿事故应采取的措施”，提出了六项具体措施，要求铁路职工切实执行。中央粮食部和中央铁道部商务、车务、车辆三局及时提出这一问题，是完全正确的；但问题提出之后，领导机关的责任就在于动员职工切实执行，并组织有效的检查，以保证粮食的安全运输。
