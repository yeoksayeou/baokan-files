    Making Preparations to Welcome New Grain into Storage
    Hunan and Henan Provinces Actively Carry Out Cleaning, Disinfection, and Other Work
    Grain warehouses in various parts of Hunan Province have begun cleaning and disinfection work to welcome the storage of early rice and other new grains. Wugang County adopted the method of "emptying warehouses while disinfecting," disinfecting warehouses capable of holding two million jin of grain within ten days, with an insecticidal effect of over 90%. According to incomplete statistics from Qidong County, grain warehouses with a capacity of over 5.7 million jin were disinfected in half a month. In ten days, Zhijiang County completed the cleaning and disinfection of grain warehouses with a total area of over 60,000 square feet, and sprayed agents outside the warehouses.

    The grain departments of Luoyang Special District in Henan Province are actively preparing for the summer grain storage. The warehouses vacated by combining and centralizing warehouses can meet the needs of summer grain storage. By the beginning of June, 40% of the warehouses and 72% of the equipment had been disinfected. Grain departments in Yiyang, Shanxian, Lushi, Luoyang and other counties launched a competition to create a batch of insect-free grain warehouses by doing a good job in cleaning and disinfection. The warehouses prepared in Yiyang County have generally been swept and disinfected twice, and the garbage outside the warehouses has also been cleared. Grain depots in northern Xin'an County and Licun in Luoyang County have sealed rat holes with sulfur slag, a mixture of lime, sand, and clay, and other materials.

    In order to welcome the storage of summer grain wheat, the grain departments of Taian and Laiyang Special Districts in Shandong Province actively carried out various preparatory work such as repairing warehouses, preparing packaging materials, and repairing scales and distributing manpower. Now, the counties in Taian Special District have basically completed the preparations for wheat storage. Dongping County has prepared more than 450 empty warehouses with a capacity of more than 11.7 million jin of wheat, and has generally carried out paving, cleaning, and disinfection. At the same time, it has prepared many open-air granary yards, which can hold more than 7 million jin of wheat. The counties in Laiyang Special District have prepared about 8,000 warehouses, which can store about 170 million jin of wheat, and are now carrying out repairs, paving, and disinfection. The Grain Bureau of the Special Commissioner's Office also organized three working groups to go to various counties to assist in repairing scales and other work.
