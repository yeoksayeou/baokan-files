The Jilin Transportation Bureau of the Ministry of Railways organized 1,411 over-axle trains from January to June 23 this year, completing the annual over-axle plan of 640,000 tons ahead of schedule.

After the National Railway Work Conference, the Jilin Transportation Bureau formulated specific measures based on the decision to steadily carry out full-load, over-axle, and 500-kilometer movements: emphasizing the organization of traffic flow and strictly controlling under-axle trains. The number of under-axle trains in May decreased by 61.2% compared to April; and in June, it decreased by another 57% compared to May. On this basis, all employees organized over-axle trains according to the principle of "more over-axle trains, stable over-tonnage." Each locomotive depot also assessed the quality of locomotives and the technical skills of drivers, and sent the assessment forms to relevant marshalling stations and dispatching offices to control train formation. Thanks to the efforts of all employees, 33.5% of sectional and through trains were over-axle in June, increasing the average gross traction weight of each train by 54 tons compared to the bureau's standard.

Due to the Jilin Bureau's vigorous organization of over-axle trains, a total of 661 fewer trains were run in the first half of the year, saving 207 locomotives, reducing the waste of single-engine travel, and overcoming train congestion.

    铁道部吉林运输分局提前完成全年超轴计划
    铁道部吉林运输分局从今年一月份到六月二十三日组织超轴列车一千四百一十一列，提前完成了全年六十四万吨的超轴计划。
    全国铁路工作会议之后，吉林运输分局根据稳步开展满载、超轴、五百公里运动的决定，制定出具体办法：强调组织车流，严格控制列车欠轴。五月份欠轴列车比四月份减少百分之六十一点二；六月又比五月减少百分之五十七。全体职工在这个基础上，按照“多超列数，稳超吨数”的原则，组织超轴列车。各机务段并给机车质量和司机技术做了鉴定，把鉴定表送给有关编组站和调度所，掌握编车。由于全体职工的努力，在六月份区段和直通列车中有百分之三十三点五的列车超轴，使每个列车的平均牵引总重比局定标准提高五十四吨。
    由于吉林分局大力组织超轴列车，上半年共少开六百六十一次列车，节省二百零七台机车，减少单机行走的浪费，克服了列车拥挤现象。
