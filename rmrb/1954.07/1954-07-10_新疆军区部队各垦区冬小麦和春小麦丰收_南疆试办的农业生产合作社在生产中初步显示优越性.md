    Bumper Harvest of Winter and Spring Wheat in Various Reclamation Areas of Xinjiang Military Region Troops
    Agricultural Production Cooperatives Trialed in Southern Xinjiang Initially Demonstrate Superiority in Production
    The more than 400,000 mu of winter and spring wheat grown by the agricultural production troops of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Xinjiang Military Region have achieved a bumper harvest. Various reclamation areas began harvesting in late June and early July.

    The total output of the more than 400,000 mu of wheat grown by the agricultural production troops this year is estimated to exceed last year's bumper harvest level. Preliminary assessments of the 120,000 mu of wheat in the Manas River basin reclamation area estimate a yield increase of 15 to 20 percent compared to last year. The winter and spring wheat in the Kaidu River basin reclamation area is estimated to have a minimum yield of 230 jin per mu, with over 14,600 mu yielding over 500 jin, fully demonstrating the superiority of collective farming and mechanized farming.

    During the summer harvest, the agricultural production troops deployed a total of 63 combine harvesters and 490 horse-drawn reapers. Each reclamation area also established summer harvest headquarters, trained a new batch of combine harvester operators, and reorganized and redeployed manpower, machinery, and horses. Cadres and soldiers also launched summer harvest competitions. (Xinhua News Agency)

    Southern Xinjiang Province is the province's main agricultural area. The thirty agricultural production cooperatives trialed this spring have initially demonstrated superiority in production.

    During the spring plowing and production, the agricultural production cooperatives universally used new-style walking plows and cotton planters, adopted high-quality seeds, plowed the land three or four times before sowing, and applied large amounts of base fertilizer. Crops such as wheat, cotton, and corn were all sown in rows. The agricultural production cooperative in Gama Village, Hotan County, adopted a new cultivation method of wide-row sowing and appropriate dense planting in spring wheat fields, prompting other farmers in Gama Village to convert nearly a thousand mu of spring wheat fields to row sowing. In the past, local farmers generally did not have harrowing tools, and after sowing the seeds, they would bury them with their feet. This year, after the agricultural production cooperative made harrows from tree branches, other local farmers also followed suit.

    During the spring plowing and production, agricultural production cooperatives in various places planted various crops according to the soil quality. After merging many small plots of land, the field ridges around them were removed, which not only facilitated the use of new farm tools but also expanded the cultivated area. The spring sowing period of the thirty agricultural production cooperatives was ten days to half a month earlier than that of general mutual aid teams and individual farmers, and the amount of fertilizer applied was one to two times higher than that of general farmers. Currently, all crops are growing more vigorously than those planted by general farmers. (Xinhua News Agency)

    新疆军区部队各垦区冬小麦和春小麦丰收
    南疆试办的农业生产合作社在生产中初步显示优越性
    中国人民解放军新疆军区参加农业生产部队的四十多万亩冬小麦和春小麦获得丰收。各垦区已在六月底七月初先后开始收割。
    今年参加农业生产部队的四十多万亩小麦的总产量，估计可以超过去年丰收的水平。玛纳斯河流域屯垦区的十二万亩小麦经过初步鉴定，估计可比去年增产百分之十五到二十。开都河流域屯垦区的冬小麦和春小麦，估计每亩产量最低不少于二百三十斤，产量在五百斤以上的有一万四千六百多亩，充分显示了集体耕作和机械耕作的优越性。
    在夏收中，参加农业生产部队共出动了六十三台联合收割机和四百九十台马拉割麦机。各垦区并分别设立了夏收指挥部，训练了一批新的联合收割机手，并重新组织调配了人力和机器、马匹。干部、战士们还展开了夏收竞赛。（新华社）
    新疆省南部是全省主要的农业区，今年春天试办的三十个农业生产合作社，在生产中已初步显示出优越性。
    各农业生产合作社在春耕生产中普遍使用新式步犁、播棉机，采用优良籽种，播种前土地犁了三四次，施了大量基肥，小麦、棉花、玉米等作物都采用条播方法。和阗县加马力克乡农业生产合作社在春麦地采用宽幅条播和适当密植的新耕作法，带动了加马力克乡的其他农民把近千亩春麦地改为条播。过去当地农民普遍没有耱地的工具，籽种播在地里，农民用脚来埋。农业生产合作社今年用树梢编成耱耱地以后，当地其他农民也仿照着做。
    各地农业生产合作社在春耕生产中，根据土质种植了各种作物。许多小块土地经过合并后，铲除了四周田埂，不仅便于使用新式农具，还扩大了耕地面积。三十个农业生产合作社的春耕播种期比一般互助组和单干农民提前了十天到半月，施肥量比一般农民增加了一倍到两倍。现在，各种作物都比一般农民种植的茁壮。（新华社）
