Xinhua News Agency, 23rd. The Jingcheng Railway, spanning the Great Wall, has completed its entire track-laying task. The completion of this railway will allow coal from the Xinglong Coal Mine to be transported smoothly to Beijing. It will also connect with the Jin(zhou)-Cheng(de) Railway, enabling the rapid transport of goods from the Northeast region to the South, further promoting the exchange of goods between the North and the South.

The Jingcheng Railway runs from Beijing through Tongzhou, Huairou, Miyun, Xinglong, Shangbancheng, and reaches Chengde, with a total length of 260 kilometers. During the Anti-Japanese War, Japanese militarism, in order to plunder China, built a railway with very low standards between Beijing and Chengde, which was destroyed and dismantled during the Liberation War. After liberation, in order to meet the needs of industrial and agricultural development, the state decided to re-select the route and build the Jingcheng Railway. In 1952, the Jin(zhou)-Cheng(de) Railway was first repaired. In 1954, construction began southward from Shangbancheng Station on the Jincheng line. It was opened to traffic to Yingshouyingzi in 1956. At the beginning of last year, construction continued from Yingshouyingzi to Huairou (the section from Huairou to Beijing was originally open to traffic). The entire line was completed on November 7 this year.

Currently, this railway is stepping up its road maintenance work to increase the passing capacity of trains and will soon be officially operating.

Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 23rd. The railway under construction between Xining and Datong. The track-laying project for this railway began at the end of October, and the station buildings and communication lines along the line are also being stepped up for construction and erection.

The Xining-Datong Railway is a local railway run by Qinghai Province itself, with a total length of 45 kilometers. The construction of this railway is to solve the transportation problem of industrial and domestic coal used in Xining and eastern Qinghai counties. The Datong Coal Mine currently produces 80,000 to 90,000 tons of raw coal per month, and after expansion next year, it will produce 120,000 tons of raw coal per month. At present, due to insufficient transportation capacity, the large-scale export of coal has been affected. After the railway is completed, it will further stimulate coal mine production.

### 京承铁路全线修通  西宁至大通的铁路加紧修筑

    京承铁路全线修通
    西宁至大通的铁路加紧修筑
    新华社23日讯　横跨万里长城的京承铁路已经完成全线铺轨任务。这条铁路修通后，将使兴隆煤矿的煤顺利运入北京。它还将和锦（州）承（德）路联接起来，使东北地区的物资能够迅速运往南方，进一步促进南北物资的交流。
    京承铁路，从北京经通州、怀柔、密云、兴隆、上板城到达承德，全长二百六十公里。抗日战争时期，日本军国主义为了掠夺中国，曾经在北京到承德之间，修过一条标准很低的铁路，在解放战争时期被毁拆除。解放后，为了适应工农业发展的需要，国家决定重新选线建筑京承铁路。1952年先修复了锦（州）—承（德）铁路，1954年又由锦承线的上板城车站开始向南修建，1956年通车到鹰手营子，去年年初又继续修建从鹰手营子到怀柔的一段（怀柔至北京原来就通车），到今年11月7日全线修通。
    现在，这条铁路正在抓紧养路工作，提高列车的通过能力，不久即将正式运营。
    新华社西宁23日电西宁至大通间正在修筑铁路。这条铁路的铺轨工程在10月底开始，沿线各车站站舍和通讯线路也正在加紧修建和架设中。
    西宁—大通铁路是青海省自己营办的一条地方铁路，全长四十五公里。修建这条铁路是为了解决西宁和青海东部各县工业和生活用煤的运输问题。大通煤矿目前月产八、九万吨原煤，明年扩建后将月产原煤十二万吨。现在由于运输力不足，影响了煤炭大量外运，铁路建成后，将进一步刺激煤矿生产。
