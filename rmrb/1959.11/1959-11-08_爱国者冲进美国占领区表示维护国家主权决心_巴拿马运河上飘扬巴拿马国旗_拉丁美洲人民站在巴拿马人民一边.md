Xinhua News Agency, November 6th, Panama City dispatch: Following the anti-American demonstrations held by the people of the Panamanian capital on November 3rd and 4th, on the 5th, two hundred Panamanian patriots entered the tense Panama Canal Zone under American occupation and erected a large Panamanian flag on a vacant piece of land in the Canal Zone, expressing the determination of the Panamanian people to safeguard national sovereignty. These Panamanian patriots entered the Canal Zone after American troops withdrew from the border demarcation line of the Canal Zone on the 5th.

    Panamanian President de la Guardia delivered a speech on the radio on the evening of the 4th, condemning the American army for using tear gas and firing on unarmed Panamanians demonstrating on Independence Day.

    According to reports, in the demonstration movement held by the Panamanian people on the 3rd, at least one hundred and twenty Panamanians were injured due to the brutal attacks of fully armed American military police. Those currently receiving hospital treatment have either been stabbed or shot. The Panamanian people are extremely indignant at the brutal actions of the American military police, and Panamanian newspapers have condemned the American authorities, believing that this is a deliberate attack by the United States on Panama.

    Faced with the increasingly high anti-American sentiment of the Panamanian people, the American management authorities in the Canal Zone are deeply disturbed. Although the state of alert in the Canal Zone has been partially lifted, William Potter, the American governor of the Canal Zone, still warns American personnel not to leave the specially defended American residential areas. The Atlantic end of the canal is still defended by the US Army, with tight security.

    Xinhua News Agency, Havana, November 6th: The Executive Bureau of the People's Socialist Party of Cuba issued a statement supporting the Panamanian people's struggle to restore sovereignty over the Canal Zone and condemning the recent suppression of Panamanian demonstrators by the American garrison in the Canal Zone. "Hoy" published this statement today.

    The statement said: "We fully support the desire of the entire Panamanian people to restore national sovereignty over the Canal Zone, so that Panamanian law can be implemented in this territory of their homeland, to eliminate smuggling through the Canal Zone, to eliminate racial and ethnic discrimination existing in the area, and to obtain the benefits that this country should obtain from this transoceanic canal that divides its territory into two. At the same time, we also protest the barbarous attack by the colonial occupation forces of the United States in the Canal Zone."

    The statement pointed out that the Panamanians are fighting for national sovereignty, to control their own wealth and to achieve progress, "We Cubans and the people of other Latin American countries stand with them."

    Xinhua News Agency, Havana, November 6th: The demonstrations held by the Panamanian people to regain sovereignty over the Canal Zone have aroused widespread sympathy and support from Latin American public opinion.

    Newspapers in various capitals published news about this incident on the front page. According to Latin American News Agency reports, the Mexican "El Universal" today's headline was: "Everyone opposes the United States. The struggles of Panama, Cuba, Venezuela and Puerto Rico are all developing." "Ultimas Noticias's final news edition" headline was "Internationally, there is jubilation over Panama's protest!"

    All Cuban newspapers reported on this incident in a prominent position, as well as the support of all sectors of Cuban society in the statement issued by the University Students Federation yesterday afternoon, strongly protesting the US's brutal suppression of Panamanian demonstrators and expressing support for the Panamanian people's struggle to safeguard the integrity of national territorial sovereignty.

    Xinhua News Agency, Havana, November 5th: The Cuban Workers' Confederation issued a statement on the American occupation forces' suppression of the patriotic demonstration held by the Panamanian people on "Independence Day," saying that the Panamanian incident is the inevitable result of the awakening of the people of the countries of the American continent, who are determined to destroy the shackles of oppression and enslavement at all costs. The statement stated that the Cuban Workers' Confederation fully supports the Panamanian people's heroic struggle to win their sovereignty and sacred freedom rights.

    Rodriguez, the president of "Hoy" newspaper, wrote in an article entitled "Panama Demands the Return of Its Flag," that the events in Panama were a strong and reasonable demonstration by the Panamanian people, showing that the Panamanian people cannot be subdued. The article said that the Panama Canal was excavated under the pretext of connecting the two oceans, but it was used to divide the Latin American continent and economically, politically, militarily and ideologically intrude into it. The Canal Zone has been used in the past and is now being used by imperialism to maintain the occupying forces there and the entire network of bases in the Caribbean - Guantanamo, Puerto Rico, Dominica and other strongholds.

    The article pointed out that the Canal Zone is also a stronghold for the United States to exert economic pressure and a center of unbridled shamelessness, corruption, depravity and mass prostitution that is destroying Latin American culture.

    The article concluded that the era of American colonial rule in Latin America is coming to an end, and in the historical clock of the people of Latin American countries, the voice of the Panamanian people is another chime.

    爱国者冲进美国占领区表示维护国家主权决心
    巴拿马运河上飘扬巴拿马国旗
    拉丁美洲人民站在巴拿马人民一边
    新华社6日讯　巴拿马城消息：在11月3日和4日巴拿马首都人民举行反美示威以后，5日有二百名巴拿马爱国者进入美国占领下的气氛紧张的巴拿马运河区，把一面很大的巴拿马国旗竖立在运河区的一片空旷的土地上，表示巴拿马人民维护国家主权的决心。这些巴拿马爱国者是在美国部队5日撤出运河区边境的交界线以后进入运河区的。
    巴拿马总统德拉古阿迪亚4日晚在电台发表讲话，斥责美国军队对独立日举行示威的手无寸铁的巴拿马人使用催泪瓦斯弹和开枪射击。
    据报道，在巴拿马人民3日举行的示威运动中，至少有一百二十个巴拿马人由于全副武装的美国军警的残暴袭击而受伤。现在医院治疗的人不是受到刺刀伤就是枪伤。巴拿马人民对美国军警的残暴行动感到莫大愤慨，巴拿马报纸纷纷谴责美国当局，认为这是美国对巴拿马故意发动的进攻。
    面对着巴拿马人民日益高涨的反美情绪，运河区美国管理当局深感不安。目前运河区的警戒状态虽然已经部分解除，但是运河区美籍总督威廉·波特仍然警告美国人员不要走出特别防卫的美国人居住地区。运河的大西洋一端仍然由美国陆军防守，戒备森严。
    新华社哈瓦那6日电　古巴人民社会党全国委员会执行局发表声明，支持巴拿马人民争取恢复运河区主权的斗争，谴责美国在运河区的驻军最近对巴拿马示威群众的镇压。“今日报”今天刊载了这项声明。
    声明说：“我们全力支持整个巴拿马人民的愿望：恢复国家对运河区的主权，使巴拿马的法律在他们祖国的这块领土上得以实行，杜绝通过运河区所进行的走私活动，消除该地区所存在的种族和民族歧视，并且得到这个国家应该从这条把它的领土分割为二的两洋运河中得到的利益。同时，我们也抗议美国驻运河区的殖民占领军的野蛮进攻。”
    声明指出，巴拿马人正为争取国家主权、掌握自己的财富和获得进步而斗争，“我们古巴人和拉丁美洲其他各国人民和他们站在一起”。
    新华社哈瓦那6日电　巴拿马人民为争取恢复运河区主权而举行的示威引起了拉丁美洲舆论界的广泛同情和支持。
    各国首都的报纸都在第一版上刊登了关于这一事件的消息。据拉丁美洲通讯社报道，墨西哥“宇宙报”今天的标题是：“大家都反对美国。巴拿马、古巴、委内瑞拉和波多黎各的斗争都在发展中。”“至上报最后消息版”的头条标题是“国际上为巴拿马的抗议而感到欢欣鼓舞！”
    所有的古巴报纸都以显要地位报道了关于这一事件及古巴各阶层支持大学生联合会在昨天下午发表的声明中，强烈抗议美国对巴拿马示威群众的残酷镇压，并且表示支持巴拿马人民争取国家领土主权完整的斗争。
    新华社哈瓦那5日电　古巴工人联合会就美国占领军镇压巴拿马人民在“独立日”举行的爱国示威游行发表声明说，巴拿马事件是美洲大陆各国人民觉醒的必然结果，他们决心不顾一切来摧毁压迫和奴役的桎梏。声明表示，古巴工人联合会完全支持巴拿马人民为争取自己的主权和神圣的自由权利而进行的英勇的斗争。
    “今日报”社长罗德里格斯在一篇题为“巴拿马要求归还它的旗帜”的文章里写道，在巴拿马发生的事件是巴拿马人民一次强有力的和合乎情理的示威，表明巴拿马人民是不可能屈服的。文章说，巴拿马运河是在联接两大洋的借口下开凿的，但是却被用来分裂拉丁美洲大陆并对它进行经济、政治、军事和思想上的侵入。运河区过去和现在都被帝国主义用来保持在那儿的占领军和加勒比海地区的整个基地网——关塔那摩、波多黎各、多米尼加和其他据点。
    文章指出，运河区也是美国施加经济压力的据点和破坏着拉丁美洲文化的荒淫无耻、腐化堕落和大量卖淫的中心。
    文章最后说，美国在拉丁美洲进行殖民统治的时代正在结束，在拉丁美洲各国人民的历史的时钟上，巴拿马人民的呼声是另一声钟响。
