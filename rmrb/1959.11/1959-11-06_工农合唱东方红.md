    The Worker-Peasant Chorus "The East is Red" (Tune)
    Shen Pengnian
  [Overture]
  The east wind blows all over Luoyang city,
  The tractor factory opens with flying colors.
  The tractor's brand is "The East is Red,"
  Its beautiful body is rose red.
  Twenty thousand workers support agriculture with their red hearts,
  The peasant brothers' production enthusiasm is as red as fire.
  Listen! The sound of the tracks roars,
  "The East is Red" lines up out of the factory in great power!
  [Counting Rhyme]
  Our country's First Tractor Factory,
  Officially started production on November 1st.
  The iron ox team is mighty,
  Going to the commune to till the land.
  Twenty thousand workers cheer the great victory of the
    General Line,
  The production of iron oxen is clear proof of more, faster,
    better, and more economical results!
  It's hard for singers to sing of all the heroes,
  Sing once of the young steelmaking heroes.
  Sing once of the August 1st Youth Furnace's hero furnace
    workers,
  Every one of them is a modern-day Wu Song!
  [Southern Gong, Northern Drum]
  In the year of '58, mid-June,
  The Great Leap Forward, its momentum heroic,
  The workshop Party committee's command flag waves!
  We are determined to rush to build an electric furnace!
  The whole workshop bursts with cheers,
  Competing to come forward to take orders!
  [Auspicious Year]
  Rushing to build an electric steel furnace is arduous and glorious,
  It must be built before "August 1st."
  The short time frame makes the task like a mountain's weight,
  The Party entrusts the task to five heroes.
  Team leader Dai Ershen takes the lead in charging forward,
  The heroes each display their magical powers.
  On July 29th, a great victory is achieved,
  The first furnace of molten steel is refined, bright and red.
  The whole people refine steel, the heroes are overjoyed,
  Determined to make the five-ton electric furnace increase production.
  The Party's call is inspiring,
  Even in dreams, they think of "1070."
  [Yun Su Tune]
  The heroes' drive soars to the sky, their enthusiasm like fire,
  The Party secretary comes to encourage them again:
  "Young men, look at this People's Daily,
  The news from Sichuan Province is printed on it.
  There is a three-ton electric furnace with no small amount of drive,
  One furnace refined thirteen and a half tons plus a fraction!
  The heroes are truly happy to read the news,
  "Okay! Comrade Secretary! We must compete for the top
    spot and catch up with Sichuan, to win first place in the
    whole country!"
  [Clapper Talk]
  The heroes use their brains,
  Finding clever solutions in every possible way.
  Daring to think, dare to do, acting as pioneers,
  The steel furnace's output keeps growing.
  Eight tons, ten tons, fifteen tons,
  Every furnace of red steel truly lovable!
  The Party's concern is so warm,
  The Municipal Party Secretary comes to the furnace to express
    sympathy.
  The heroes' hearts are sweeter than sweet,
  The Great Leap Forward's fast horse whips three times faster.
  Conservatives, head-shaking faction,
  Pouring cold water over it:
  "Roots, not easy to plant,
  Don't break the electric furnace!"
  "Young people, messing around,
  It's no light matter if something goes wrong!"
  The heroes cast aside the idle talk,
  With the Party committee's support, they hold up the sky.
  One furnace loads eighteen and a half tons,
  The good news spreads throughout the factory.
  The highest furnace output is twenty-two tons,
  The news spreads all over the country.
  The head-shaking faction, lowered their heads,
  The conservative faction oiled the soles of their feet and fled.
  A red flag flies in the wind,
  Victory belongs to the great Party!
  The red flag is red on the youth furnace,
  Thanks to the great leader Mao Zedong!
  The Mao Zedong era produces heroes,
  The tractor factory opens a team of "East is Red"!
  [Peasant Music]
  Commune members smile continuously,
  The iron ox is driven to the commune.
  Worker brothers' feelings are profound,
  The big iron ox "East is Red,"
  Both harrowing and plowing,
  This generous gift is truly grand!
  The tractor factory officially starts production,
  The youth furnace's flames are especially red.
  Every furnace of red steel shines brightly,
  Teams of iron oxen surge outwards.
  Workers and peasants are close brothers,
  Workers and peasants sing together "The East is Red"!

    工农合唱东方红（牌子曲）
    沈彭年
  〔曲头〕
  东风吹遍洛阳城，
  拖拉机厂开门红。
  拖拉机牌号“东方红”，
  美丽的机身玫瑰红。
  两万职工支援农业的红心红，
  农民弟兄生产热情如火红。
  听！履带轰鸣声震耳，
  “东方红”列队出厂好威风！
  〔数唱〕
  我国的第一拖拉机厂，
  十一月一日正式开工。
  铁牛大队浩浩荡荡，
  就开往公社去把地耕。
  两万职工欢呼总路线的伟大胜
    利，
  铁牛出厂这是多快好省的明
    证！
  唱曲人难把英雄唱遍，
  唱一回炼钢的青年英雄。
  唱一回八一青年炉英雄炉手，
  个个全是当代武松！
  〔南锣北鼓〕
  五八年　六月中，
  大跃进　气势雄，
  车间党委令旗动！
  定把电炉抢建成！
  全车间　腾欢声，
  争先恐后来讨令！
  〔太平年〕
  抢建电钢炉，艰巨光荣，
  必须在“八一”以前修建成。
  短短的光阴任务如山重，
  党把任务交给了五位英雄。
  组长戴尔身，带头冲锋，
  英雄们一个一个显神通。
  七月二十九号大获全胜，
  炼出了第一炉钢水明亮通红。
  全民炼钢铁，英雄们喜冲冲，
  决心叫五吨电炉把产量上升。
  党的号召叫人激动，
  睡梦里也惦念着“1070”。
  〔云苏调〕
  英雄们干劲冲天热情似火，
  党委书记又来鼓励他们：
  “小伙子们看看这张人民日报，
  四川省的新闻在上面登。
  有一个三吨电炉干劲不小，
  一炉子炼了十三吨半还挂零！
  众英雄读了消息真高兴，
  “好！书记同志！我们一定争上
    游赶四川，要在全国夺头
    名！”
  〔快板〕
  众英雄动脑筋，
  千方百计找窍门。
  敢想敢做当闯将，
  钢炉产量往上长。
  八吨、十吨、十五吨，
  炉炉红钢真爱人！
  党的关怀多温暖，
  市委书记慰问到炉前。
  英雄们心里甜上甜，
  跃进快马猛三鞭。
  保守派，摇头派，
  抬着凉水泼下来：
  “命根子，不容易栽，
  别把电炉给整坏！”
  “年轻人，胡折腾，
  惹出祸来就不轻！”
  英雄们把闲话丢一边，
  党委撑腰顶住天。
  一炉装了十八吨半，
  喜讯全厂都传遍。
  最高炉产二十二吨，
  祖国各地传新闻。
  摇头派，低了头，
  保守派脚下抹了油。
  一杆红旗迎风扬，
  胜利归于伟大的党！
  青年炉上红旗红，
  归功于伟大领袖毛泽东！
  毛泽东时代出英雄，
  拖拉机厂开出大队“东方红”！〔农民乐〕
  社员同志笑连声，
  铁牛开到公社中。
  工人大哥情义重，
  大铁牛“东方红”，
  又是耙，又是耕，
  这一份厚礼真隆重！
  拖拉机厂正式开工，
  青年炉炉火分外红。
  炉炉红钢红光闪，
  大队铁牛往外涌。
  工人农民亲弟兄，
  工农合唱“东方红”！
