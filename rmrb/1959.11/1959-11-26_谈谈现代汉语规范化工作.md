The Standardization of Modern Chinese is the Central Task of Chinese Language Research

Over the past ten years, especially since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, our country has undergone extremely profound changes. Chinese language research, like other cultural construction endeavors, has also achieved great success under the correct leadership of the Party.

The Chinese language research of the past ten years has been centered on the task of standardizing modern Chinese. The "modern Chinese" mentioned here does not refer to any form of Chinese in general, but to Chinese as the national common language and as the literary language. The "standard" of a language refers to the standards in terms of phonetics, grammar, and vocabulary. Language is a tool for people to communicate and exchange ideas, and there must be a common standard so that people can correctly understand each other and better coordinate their work in a common cause.

Why is the task of standardizing modern Chinese being put forward now? This question needs to be explained from the history of the development of the Chinese language. Chinese had its own literary language very early on, which we now call "Classical Chinese." After being used, processed, and improved by many literati and scholars over two to three thousand years, Classical Chinese had certain standards. However, for a long period, Classical Chinese was only a communication tool for a small number of educated people, and it was detached from the spoken language of the people. Some patriots in modern times deeply felt this contradiction, and they demanded to replace Classical Chinese with "vernacular Chinese," which was closer to the spoken language of the people. However, it was the "May Fourth" New Culture Movement that fundamentally shook the dominance of Classical Chinese and truly established vernacular Chinese as the literary language.

Vernacular Chinese is based on spoken language, but the actual situation of spoken Chinese is quite complex. Chinese has many dialects. Dialectal differences are manifested in phonetics, vocabulary, and grammar, with phonetic differences being the most serious, even to the extent that people from different dialect areas find it difficult to communicate. As the foundation of the literary language, there must be a common spoken language with consistent and clear standards. This issue once caused heated debates among linguists, especially on the issue of phonetic standards. Some advocated taking Beijing pronunciation as the standard. Others advocated not fully adopting Beijing pronunciation, but appropriately considering dialectal pronunciations (such as retaining the distinction between sharp and round sounds, retaining entering tones, etc.) to form a kind of "National Language" (different from what we understand as Putonghua today). There were also different views on the standardization of vocabulary and grammar.

As for the written language, vernacular Chinese has indeed produced many influential literary works, such as *Romance of the Three Kingdoms*, *Water Margin*, *The Scholars*, and *Dream of the Red Chamber*, but the language of these works all has its own local color, and also has greater or lesser distance from modern spoken language. Moreover, once it changes from being used only for popular literature to a written language for comprehensive application, vernacular Chinese itself has also undergone great changes. Writers from dialect areas cannot avoid bringing some dialectal components into their works. A large number of translated works have also brought in some foreign components. And in order to meet the needs of the new situation, we are constantly using ancient components to create new words and phrases. In this way, vernacular Chinese has developed rapidly and become enriched; on the other hand, due to the simultaneous influx of various components in large quantities, various intersections and contradictions have also occurred, and many standardization problems have arisen.

Before the nationwide liberation, some linguists also noticed the standardization problem of Chinese and launched the "National Language Movement" and discussions on the "Mass Language" issue. The phonetic alphabet and the Latinized New Script also played a certain role in the promotion of Northern dialect. However, from the reactionary regime, these movements did not receive any help, but rather indifference and even suppression. The reactionary rulers were very afraid of the revolutionary awakening of the people, and they always tried every means to restrict and deprive the people of the right to learn new written languages and improve their culture, and of course it was impossible to take a positive and supportive attitude towards language movements. Only after liberation was the issue of Chinese language standardization put on the agenda.

The Party saw the inconsistent internal standardization of the Chinese language, and also saw that only a national common language with a high degree of internal standardization could better undertake the important tasks of uniting the people, developing culture, and accelerating socialist construction. Therefore, on the one hand, it called on the people of the whole country to pay attention to this issue, and on the other hand, it put forward the major task of studying the standardization of modern Chinese to linguists. Over the past ten years, under the guidance of the Party, Chinese linguistics has developed along the road of task-driven research and linking theory with practice.

What Standard Should be Used for Standardization?

After the nationwide liberation, the Party asked everyone to pay attention to the standardization of Chinese. On June 6, 1951, the *People's Daily* published an editorial entitled "Use the Motherland's Language Correctly, and Strive for the Purity and Health of the Language!" It exposed the ambiguity and confusion in the use of language in newspapers, books, and documents, pointed out its harms, and called on everyone to seriously study the motherland's language. After the publication of the editorial, a high tide of learning grammar and rhetoric was quickly set off among the vast number of cadres.

The First National Conference on Writing Reform and the Academic Conference on the Standardization of Modern Chinese in 1955 were important signs that the standardization work had begun to move forward by leaps and bounds. In addition to linguists and language teachers, writers, actors, and editors also participated in the meeting. The most important gain of these two meetings was the affirmation that Putonghua, the common language of the Han nationality, should take Beijing pronunciation as the standard pronunciation, Northern dialect as the basic dialect, and exemplary modern vernacular Chinese works as the grammatical standard. This established a clear standard for Chinese language standardization work.

Why should Putonghua take Northern dialect as the basic dialect? The national common language always takes one dialect as the basis. A dialect gets the opportunity to develop, and more and more people use it in writing and speech, and slowly it forms the national common language. Measured by this requirement, only Northern dialect has the qualifications to be the basic dialect of Putonghua. People who speak Northern dialect account for the majority of the Han population, and for a long time, Northern dialect has been used in literary creation. Taking Northern dialect as the basic dialect of Putonghua is in line with historical development and also an affirmation of the actual situation.

Why should Putonghua take Beijing pronunciation as the standard pronunciation? The standard pronunciation must be based on the pronunciation of a certain place, and cannot be created or pieced together artificially, because pronunciation is systematic. Only by adopting a complete pronunciation system as the standard pronunciation is it convenient to learn. Taking Beijing pronunciation as the standard pronunciation is mainly because Beijing has been the capital since the Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties, and has always been a political and cultural center. For a long time, Beijing pronunciation has been representative in Northern dialect, and today, Beijing has an even more important position in the national political and cultural life. After clarifying that Beijing pronunciation is the standard pronunciation, the question of whether to distinguish between sharp and round sounds and whether to retain entering tones has also been resolved.

Why should Putonghua take exemplary modern vernacular Chinese works as the grammatical standard? Saying exemplary works, not general works, is because there are various kinds of works, there are works that are discarded after being read, and there are works that are recited for a long time. Undoubtedly, the latter plays a decisive role in the consolidation and development of standards. As for these vernacular Chinese works must be modern, the reason is also obvious, because language is constantly developing. Earlier works, such as *Water Margin* and *Dream of the Red Chamber*, no matter how beautiful their language is, there are always some places that do not conform to modern language habits.

Achieving unanimous opinions on these principled issues provides a direction to follow in carrying out standardization work. On the other hand, due to individual differences in understanding these principles, there will inevitably be some differences in application, and further research on these principles in future work is also very necessary.

Great Achievements Have Been Made in Promoting Putonghua in Dialect Areas

In the work of standardizing modern Chinese, vigorously promoting Putonghua in dialect areas has special and important significance. In October 1955, the National Conference on Writing Reform issued a call to vigorously promote Putonghua. In November, the Ministry of Education issued instructions to vigorously promote Putonghua in primary and secondary schools and at all levels of normal schools. In February 1956, the State Council issued instructions on the promotion of Putonghua and established the Central Committee for the Promotion of Putonghua. The work of promoting Putonghua quickly spread throughout the country. Thanks to the Party's attention and the adoption of the mass movement approach, by the time the First National Observation Meeting on the Achievements of Putonghua Teaching was held in July 1958, great achievements had been made in the promotion of Putonghua in just over two years, far exceeding the achievements of the National Language Movement in the forty years before liberation. For example, in Wushan Township, Datian County, Fujian, under the leadership of the Party committee, and through the efforts of the people of the whole township, in just fifty days, 77.7% of the two thousand three hundred and seventy-nine young people and adults in the township were able to speak Putonghua. After a month of hard work, Shunxing Road Primary School in Qingdao popularized Putonghua throughout the school. This fully proves that the promotion of Putonghua, like other tasks, can be achieved through a great leap forward.

In the promotion of Putonghua, the Chinese Pinyin Scheme played a great role. This scheme uses twenty-five internationally used Latin letters, plus four tone symbols, to spell out all the syllables of Beijing pronunciation. It has the advantages of being simple and easy to learn. Compared with the phonetic alphabet, the number of Chinese Pinyin letters is smaller and it is easy to write them together. Since the promulgation of the Chinese Pinyin Scheme, the work of promoting Putonghua has accelerated due to the new and favorable tool, and the work of eliminating illiteracy has also achieved solid results, which fully proves its superiority.

It is a very correct decision that Putonghua takes Beijing pronunciation as the standard pronunciation. However, Beijing dialect itself also has many words with different pronunciations, and there are still many differences in the pronunciation of words, such as "供给" (gōngjǐ or gònggěi), "危险" (wēixiǎn or wèixiǎn). There are many such examples, which often make it difficult for learners to adapt. In order to study and determine the pronunciation of commonly used vocabulary in Putonghua, after the Academic Conference on the Standardization of Chinese Language, the Chinese Academy of Sciences organized the Putonghua Pronunciation Review Committee, which began to review the pronunciation of words with different pronunciations in April 1956. The Pronunciation Review Committee successively published two drafts of the Pronunciation Review Table for Words with Different Pronunciations in October 1957 and July 1959, reviewing the pronunciation of more than 1,200 words with different pronunciations, basically including words with different pronunciations in commonly used vocabulary in Putonghua; in addition, it also reviewed the pronunciation of 170 place names (mainly county and city names).

Under the situation of promoting Putonghua throughout the country, dialect investigation has taken on new significance. By investigating dialects and studying the correspondence between local pronunciations and Beijing pronunciation, people in dialect areas can be helped to learn Putonghua. The nationwide general survey of Chinese dialects began in 1956. This dialect survey took the county and equivalent administrative units at that time as survey points, with a total of 1,880 points. After two years of hard work, 1,822 points have been investigated, 1,195 kinds of dialect investigation reports and 307 kinds of Putonghua learning manuals have been written.

Research on the Standardization of Written Language Has Been Conducted from Various Aspects and Certain Progress Has Been Made

In the past ten years, great progress has also been made in the standardization of written language. On June 6, 1951, the *People's Daily*, while publishing the editorial "Use the Motherland's Language Correctly, and Strive for the Purity and Health of the Language!" began to serialize Lü Shuxiang and Zhu Dexi's "Lectures on Grammar and Rhetoric." This lecture focused on practical examples, combined with analysis of common non-standard sentences in newspapers and periodicals, to help readers master general knowledge of grammar and rhetoric. From 1952 to before the Academic Conference on the Standardization of Modern Chinese in 1955, about forty kinds of grammar books were published (if you add books on writing, – this kind of book also talks about some grammatical issues – the number would be much larger). Many of these grammar books are popular readings, and have been reprinted more than once (such as Cao Bohan's *Elementary Grammar*, which has been printed more than 1.8 million copies), which has played a great role in popularizing grammatical knowledge.

Since the Party issued the call to strive for the purity and health of the language, many language publications have been founded, such as *Language Learning*, *Chinese Language*, *Language Teaching*, *Language Knowledge*, and so on. Over the years, these language publications have taken promoting the standardization of written language as one of their main tasks. *Language Learning* opened a column "Examples of Synonyms" (later changed to "Distinguishing Word Meanings") from the November 1951 issue to the December 1958 issue, analyzing more than 160 groups of words with similar meanings and often confused when used. *Language Knowledge* successively opened columns such as "Correcting Wrong Sentences" and "Non-standardized Words and Sentences," and *Chinese Language* also opened a "Short Comments on Language" column, all of which selected non-standard sentences in general newspapers and periodicals for analysis, and put forward opinions on how to correct them.

In addition to language publications, as early as 1950 and 1951, the *People's Daily*, *Workers' Daily*, *Shanghai Ta Kung Pao*, and *Wen Hui Bao* also published articles on standardization. The scope of discussion was very broad, including how to use spoken language, how to learn the language of the masses, the use of Classical Chinese components in modern Chinese, and the use of dialectal components in literary language. A larger-scale discussion was the discussion on the use of dialectal components in literary works organized by *Literary Gazette* in 1951. The debate focused on the question of whether to use the national common language or dialect for writing. Through discussion, it was clarified that the two are not in conflict. The national common language does not exclude dialectal components, and must enrich the common language with dialectal vocabulary. However, the use of any dialect should be selective, avoiding the use of special vocabulary that is too difficult to understand and not vivid. After *People's Literature* published Zhou Libo's novel *Great Changes in a Mountain Village* in 1958, it aroused another discussion on the use of dialectal colloquialisms in literary works. *Literary Gazette* and *People's Literature* both had comments and readers' letters talking about this issue. Most people agree that the appropriate use of dialectal components can make the language of literary works vivid and lively, but they also affirmed that writers are language artists and have the responsibility to refine and preserve the essence of dialectal colloquialisms, and should not abuse them.

The discussion on grammar and rhetoric issues in newspapers and periodicals has driven basic research in the field of linguistics. Through the study of Stalin's *Marxism and Problems of Linguistics* published in 1950, further clarity and improvement has been achieved on some important theoretical issues, which has also played a positive role in promoting our research work.

Grammar research has been very active in the past ten years, with about six hundred grammar papers published in newspapers and periodicals.

In terms of vocabulary, several books analyzing word meanings have been published in the past two years, such as the *Analysis of Word Meanings* (First Series) by the Language Learning Magazine, and the *Analysis of Synonyms* (First Series) by the Linguistics Teaching and Research Group of the Chinese Department of Nankai University. These books are very helpful for the work of vocabulary standardization. Vocabulary is the building material of language. Improper use of words will cause confusion in the language. A large part of the confusion that exists in the use of language now is precisely in the vocabulary.

The most important tool for promoting language standardization is the dictionary. In 1953, Xinhua Dictionary Publishing House published the *Xinhua Dictionary*, and in 1955, the Chinese Dictionary Compilation Office published the *Homophone Dictionary*. These are two dictionaries compiled for people with secondary education, and they are superior to similar dictionaries published before in terms of content. Now the Institute of Linguistics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences is compiling a *Modern Chinese Dictionary*. The main purpose of this dictionary is to promote the standardization of modern Chinese, so the vocabulary included is mainly commonly used in spoken and written language since the May Fourth Movement, and it focuses on selecting new words and new meanings after liberation. Each word is annotated with Chinese Pinyin letters, and the syllables of polysyllabic words are also written together. The acceptance or rejection of the pronunciation of words with different pronunciations is based on the decision of the Putonghua Pronunciation Review Committee. The analysis of word meanings is based on modern Chinese, without detailed listing of ancient meanings, and special attention is paid to distinguishing the meanings of basic and commonly used words.

Last year and this year, many newspapers and periodicals organized discussions on the issue of writing style. The writing style referred to here refers to the style of writing, which is a comprehensive expression of written language in practical application. The quality of writing style is not entirely determined by the use of language, but should be said to be fundamentally determined by whether the ideological method is correct. However, ideas must be expressed in language, so writing style must be closely related to language. The Party and Chairman Mao have always attached great importance to the issue of writing style. As early as 1942, Chairman Mao put forward the issue of rectifying writing style in the famous article "Oppose Stereotyped Party Writing," which also focused on the issue of language. Since 1958, a high tide of the Great Leap Forward has been set off across the country, and various construction undertakings have developed rapidly, starting a great revolution in culture and technology. The new era especially needs an accurate, clear, and vivid new writing style, and the issue of writing style has once again been brought to an important position. The discussion on the issue of writing style in 1958 created a new situation in the use of written language.

The requirements of establishing a new writing style and realizing the standardization of modern Chinese are also reflected in school language teaching. Students learn the basic knowledge of Chinese through language classes from elementary school in order to cultivate the ability to use the motherland's language correctly. Modern Chinese classes in universities also pay attention to writing practice; practical issues such as writing reform, the standardization of modern Chinese, and the promotion of Putonghua have also been included in the content of lectures.

We Still Have Arduous Tasks Ahead

The work of Chinese language standardization in the past ten years has been successful, but measured by the requirements of socialist construction for language work, it should be said that what we have done is still far from enough, and there is still much work waiting for us to do. First of all, we must create the main tool for standardization – the dictionary. The *Modern Chinese Dictionary* will be published in 1960, but due to the complex situation caused by the historical development of Chinese, and also due to our lack of scientific literacy, the first edition of this dictionary is unlikely to meet the readers' requirements for it. It must be continuously revised, and language workers across the country must participate in this revision work, pointing out errors and shortcomings, and putting forward specific revision suggestions, so that it can gradually become a truly standardized modern Chinese dictionary. There are a large number of synonyms in modern Chinese, with meanings that are similar but not exactly the same. They must be carefully distinguished, and the correct and incorrect usages must be given for writers to refer to. This is not easy to do in an ordinary dictionary, so there needs to be a more complete synonym dictionary. There also needs to be a dialect dictionary for people in dialect areas to learn Putonghua. This dictionary does not need to collect very uncommon dialectal vocabulary, as long as the commonly used vocabulary in major dialect areas is recorded in contrast with Putonghua, it can provide great convenience for people learning Putonghua. Special attention should be paid here to the situation where the form of dialect words is the same as Putonghua, but the meaning or usage is actually different. For example, in some dialects, "手" (shǒu, hand) also refers to the arm, and "脚" (jiǎo, foot) also refers to the leg, and in some dialects, "切" (qiē, to cut) and "削" (xuē, to peel) are both called "削" (xuē). Being able to point out these differences can avoid the useful distinctions in Putonghua from tending to be confused due to the introduction of dialectal usages. The work of reviewing the pronunciation of Putonghua also needs to be carried out more actively. On the one hand, the already reviewed drafts should be revised according to the responses from all parties, and on the other hand, we must actively discover pronunciation differences and review them. In the work of phonetic standardization, radio stations bear a not small responsibility, and should maintain closer contact with the Pronunciation Review Committee (in radio broadcasts, it is still quite common for the same word to have different pronunciations in the mouths of different reporters). Grammarians also have a lot of work to do here. There needs to be a more complete modern Chinese grammar, making reasonable suggestions in places where there are differences in certain usages. Grammarians should also help solve the grammatical problems in dictionaries, such as labeling parts of speech. The draft of the *Modern Chinese Dictionary* has not done this, because we don't know how to label it in a way that is practical and truly useful for readers. These are just illustrations of the fact that there is still a lot of work to be done. To do this work well, we must study well. The movement to criticize bourgeois academic thought in 1958 was a profound self-revolution for the linguistic community. Judging from the situation revealed by the movement, there is still a considerable amount of bourgeois ideology in the linguistic community, and it has not yet been possible to guide its research work with the dialectical materialist stance, viewpoints, and methods, and it has not yet truly achieved linking theory with practice and consciously serving the needs of socialist construction. Compared with the brilliant achievements on the industrial and agricultural production fronts in the past ten years, we have no reason to be complacent because of a little achievement. Under the leadership of the Party, we must further transform our thinking, conscientiously implement the general line and the spirit of the Great Leap Forward in our work, work hard, strive for the top, and make more and better contributions to the people.

    谈谈现代汉语规范化工作
    中国科学院语言研究所副所长　吕叔湘
    现代汉语规范化是汉语研究的中心任务
    十年以来，特别是1958年大跃进以来，我们的国家发生了极其深刻的变化。汉语研究，同其他各项文化建设事业一样，也在党的正确领导下取得了很大的成绩。
    十年来的汉语研究是围绕着现代汉语规范化这一个中心任务进行的。这里所说的“现代汉语”不是泛指任何形式的汉语，而是指作为民族共同语、作为文学语言的汉语。语言的“规范”是指语音、语法、词汇各方面的标准。语言是人们用来交际、用来交流思想的工具，必须有一个共同的标准，才能使人们正确地互相了解，才能使人们在共同的事业中更好地协调工作。
    为什么要在现在提出现代汉语规范化这样一个任务呢？这个问题要从汉语的发展史上来说明。汉语很早就有了自己的文学语言，这种文学语言我们现在称为“文言”。文言经过两三千年内许许多多文人学士的使用、加工和提高，有了一定的规范。但是在很长的一段时期里，文言只是一小部分受过教育的人的交际工具，同人民的口语是脱节的。这个矛盾，近代的一些爱国人士已经深切地感觉到，他们要求用接近人民口语的“白话”来代替文言。但是从根本上动摇了文言的势力，使白话真正取得文学语言的地位的还是“五四”新文化运动。
    白话是拿口语做基础的，但是汉语口语的实际情况相当复杂。汉语有许多方言。方言的分歧表现在语音、词汇、语法各方面，而以语音的分歧为最严重，甚至达到不同方言区的人难以通话的程度。作为文学语言的基础，必须有一种共同的口语，具有一致的、明确的规范。这个问题曾经在语言工作者中间引起过热烈的争论，特别是在语音规范问题上。有的主张拿北京语音做标准。有的主张不完全采用北京语音，要适当地照顾方言语音（比如保留尖团音的区别，保留入声，等等），形成一种“普通话”（和我们现在所理解的普通话不同）。在词汇和语法的规范上也有不同的看法。
    就书面语的情形来说，白话诚然曾经产生过不少种有广大影响的文学作品，像《三国演义》、《水浒》、《儒林外史》、《红楼梦》，但是这些作品的语言都有各自的地方色彩，也都同现代口语有或大或小的距离。而且一旦从仅仅用于通俗文学变成全面应用的书面语，白话本身也发生了很大的变化。方言区的作家不可能不把一些方言性成分带进他们的作品。大量的翻译作品又带来了一些外来的成分。而为了适应新形势的需要，我们又不断地利用古代的成分创造新词新语。这样，白话一方面迅速发展起来，丰富起来；另一方面，由于各种成分的同时大量涌入，也发生种种交叉和矛盾，产生了许多规范问题。
    在全国解放以前，有些语文工作者也注意到汉语的规范问题，发起过“国语运动”，展开过“大众语”问题的讨论，注音字母和拉丁化新文字在北方话的推广上也起过一定的作用。但是从反动政权那里，这种种运动得不到任何帮助，所得到的是漠视乃至压制。反动统治者非常害怕人民群众的革命觉悟，他们总是千方百计限制和剥夺人民学习新的书面语言、提高文化的权利，对于语文运动当然也不可能采取积极赞助的态度。只有在解放以后，汉语规范问题才提到了日程上来。
    党看到汉语内部规范不一致的情况，也看到只有内部规范高度一致的民族共同语才能够更好地担当团结人民，发展文化，加速社会主义建设的重要任务，因此一方面号召全国人民重视这个问题，一方面向语言学工作者提出了研究现代汉语规范问题的重大任务。十年以来，我国语言学就是在党的教导下，沿着任务带动研究，理论联系实际的道路向前发展的。
    规范化应该拿什么做标准
    全国解放以后，党就要求大家注意汉语的规范问题。1951年6月6日人民日报发表社论“正确地使用祖国的语言，为语言的纯洁和健康而斗争！”揭露了报刊、书籍、文件在使用语言方面所存在的含糊和混乱的情况，指出它的害处，号召大家认真学习祖国语言。社论发表以后，很快就在广大干部中掀起了一个学习语法修辞的高潮。
    1955年召开的第一次全国文字改革会议和现代汉语规范问题学术会议，是规范化工作已经开始大踏步前进的重要标志。参加会议的除语文工作者和语文教师以外，还有作家、演员、编辑等。这两次会议最重要的收获是肯定了汉民族共同语——普通话应该以北京语音为标准音，以北方话为基础方言，以典范的现代白话文著作为语法规范。这就给汉语规范化工作制订了明确的标准。
    为什么普通话要拿北方话做基础方言呢？民族共同语总是拿一种方言做基础的。一种方言得到发展的机会，有越来越多的人在书面上和口头上使用，慢慢地就形成了民族共同语。拿这个要求来衡量，只有北方话才具备普通话的基础方言的资格。说北方话的人占汉族人口的大多数，并且长久以来，北方话就被应用于文学创作，拿北方话做普通话的基础方言是符合历史发展的，也是对于现实情况的肯定。
    为什么普通话要拿北京语音做标准音呢？标准音必须以某一个地方的语音为准，而不能凭人工创造或者拼凑，因为语音是有系统的，只有采用一个完整的语音系统作标准音，学起来才方便。以北京语音为标准音，主要是因为北京从元、明、清以来一直是国都，一直是一个政治文化中心，长时期以来，北京语音在北方话里有它的代表性，而在今天，北京在全国政治生活和文化生活中更有了重要的地位。明确了以北京语音为标准音以后，要不要分别尖团音的问题、要不要保留入声的问题也就解决了。
    为什么普通话要拿典范的现代白话文著作为语法规范呢？不说一般著作，而说典范的著作，这是因为有各种各样的著作，有看过就丢开的著作，有长久传诵的著作，在规范的巩固和发展上无疑是后者起着决定性的作用。至于这些白话文著作必须是现代的，原因也很明显，因为语言是不断发展的，较早的作品，比如《水浒》和《红楼梦》，无论它的语言多么美好，总有些地方是不符合现代的语言习惯的。
    在这些原则性问题上取得了一致的意见，进行规范化工作也就有了可以遵循的方向。另一方面，由于个人对这些原则的理解不完全相同，在应用时不免有些分歧，在今后的工作中对这些原则作进一步的研究也是非常必要的。
    在方言区推广普通话取得了很大成绩
    在现代汉语规范化工作中，在方言区大力推广普通话具有特殊重要的意义。1955年10月全国文字改革会议发出了大力推广普通话的号召。11月教育部发出了在中、小学和各级师范学校大力推广普通话的指示。1956年2月国务院发布了关于推广普通话的指示，并且成立了中央推广普通话工作委员会。推广普通话的工作在全国范围内迅速地开展起来。由于党的重视，由于采取了大搞群众运动的方式，到1958年7月召开第一次全国普通话教学成绩观摩会的时候，短短两年多，推广普通话工作已经取得很大的成就，远远超过了解放前四十多年国语运动的成绩。例如，福建大田县吴山乡在党委的领导下，经过全乡人民的努力，仅仅五十天的时间，全乡二千三百七十九名青少年和壮年已经有77.7％能够讲普通话。青岛顺兴路小学经过一个月的努力，在全校普及了普通话。这充分证明了推广普通话和其他各项工作一样，是完全可以大跃进的。
    在普通话的推广工作中，汉语拼音方案起了很大的作用。这个方案用的是二十五个国际通行的拉丁字母，加上四个声调符号，能拼写出全部北京语音的音节，它具备了简单易学的优点。同注音字母比较起来，汉语拼音字母的数目较少，并且便于连起来写。汉语拼音方案公布以来，推广普通话工作由于有了新的有利的工具而加快了步伐，扫除文盲的工作也得到巩固成绩的效果，这就充分证明了它的优越性。
    普通话以北京语音为标准音，这是很正确的决定。但是北京话本身也有不少异读词，还有好些字音上的分歧，例如“供给”（gōngjl或gònggěi），“危险”（wēixiǎn或wèixiǎn），这种例子很多，常常叫学习的人无法适从。为了研究并确定普通话常用词汇的语音，在汉语规范问题学术会议以后，中国科学院组织了普通话审音委员会，从1956年4月开始审订异读词的读音。审音委员会在1957年10月和1959年7月先后发表了两份异读词审音表（初稿），审订了一千二百多条异读词的读音，基本上包括了普通话常用词中的异读词；此外还审订了一百七十个地名的读音（以县、市名称为主）。
    在全国推广普通话的情况下，方言调查具有了新的意义。通过方言调查，研究各地方音和北京语音的对应关系，可以帮助方言区的人学习普通话。从1956年开始进行全国汉语方言普查工作。这次方言普查以当时的县及相当于县的行政单位为调查点，共有一千八百八十点。经过两年来的努力，已经调查了一千八百二十二点，写出了方言调查报告一千一百九十五种，学习普通话手册三百零七种。
    关于书面语的规范化已从各个方面进行了研究并有了一定进展
    十年以来书面语的规范化工作也有很大的进展。1951年6月6日人民日报在发表社论“正确地使用祖国的语言，为语言的纯洁和健康而斗争！”的同时，开始连载吕叔湘、朱德熙的《语法修辞讲话》，这个讲话侧重实际用例，结合分析报刊上常见的不规范的语句，帮助读者掌握语法修辞方面的一般知识。从1952年到1955年现代汉语规范问题学术会议以前，出版的语法书大约有四十种（如果加上谈写作一类的书，——这一类书里也谈到一些语法问题——数量还要多得多）。这些语法书里有不少是通俗读物，而且不止一次地重版（像曹伯韩的《语法初步》，印数已经超过一百八十万册），对普及语法知识起了很大的作用。
    自从党发出为语言的纯洁和健康而斗争的号召以后，创刊了不少语文刊物，像《语文学习》、《中国语文》、《语文教学》、《语文知识》等等。几年来，这些语文刊物都拿促进书面语的规范化作为主要任务之一。《语文学习》从1951年11月号起开辟“同义词例解”专栏（后来改为“词义辨析”），到1958年12月号，一共分析了一百六十多组意义比较相近、使用的时候常常混淆的词。《语文知识》先后开辟“改错句”、“不规范化的词和句”等专栏，《中国语文》也开辟“语文短评”栏，都是选择一般报刊上不合规范的语句加以剖析，并提出如何改正的意见。
    除了语文刊物以外，早在1950年和1951年，人民日报、工人日报、上海大公报、文汇报也都发表过有关规范化的文章。讨论的范围很广，包括怎样运用口语、怎样学习群众的语言的问题，现代汉语中使用文言成分的问题，文学语言中使用方言成分的问题。规模比较大的一次讨论是《文艺报》在1951年组织的文学作品中使用方言问题的讨论。争论集中在应该用民族共同语还是用方言来写作的问题上。通过讨论，明确了这两者并不是冲突的，民族共同语并不排斥方言成分，而且必须以方言词汇来丰富共同语。但是使用任何方言都应该有所选择，避免使用那些太难懂而且并不生动的特殊词汇。1958年《人民文学》发表了周立波的长篇小说《山乡巨变》以后，引起了又一次关于文学作品中使用方言土语的讨论。《文艺报》和《人民文学》都有评论和读者来信谈到这个问题。大多数人都同意适当地采用方言成分能使文学作品的语言生动活泼，但是也都肯定作家是语言艺术家，有责任对方言土语作一番去粗存精的功夫，而不应该滥用。
    报刊上关于语法修辞问题的讨论带动了语言学领域内的基本性研究。通过对斯大林1950年发表的《马克思主义与语言学问题》的学习，在一些重要的理论问题上得到了进一步的明确与提高，对于我们的研究工作也起了积极推动的作用。
    十年以来，语法研究非常活跃，报刊上发表的语法论文有六百篇左右。
    在词汇方面，最近两年出版了几部辨析词义的书，如语文学习杂志社的《词义辨析》（第一辑），南开大学中文系语言学教研组的《同义词分析》（第一辑）。这些书对于词汇规范化的工作都是很有帮助的。词汇是语言的建筑材料，用词不当就会造成语言的混乱，现在在语言使用上存在的混乱情形一大部分正是在词汇方面。
    推动语言规范化的最重要的工具是词典。1953年新华辞书社出版了《新华字典》、1955年中国大辞典编纂处出版了《同音字典》，这是两部为中等文化程度的人编的字典，在内容上都有胜过以前出版的同类字典的地方。现在中国科学院语言研究所正在编纂一部《现代汉语词典》。这部词典以促进现代汉语规范化为其主要目的，因此所收语汇主要是五四以来口语里和书面上通用的，对解放后的新词、新义更着重选录。每个词都用汉语拼音字母注音，多音词的几个音节也都连写。异读词的读音取舍根据普通话审音委员会的决定。分析词义以现代汉语为准，不详列古义，而且特别注意分辨基本的、常用的词的意义。
    去年和今年，许多报刊都组织了有关文风问题的讨论。这里所说的文风是指文章的作风、风格，是书面语言在实际运用中的全面表现。文风的好坏不完全决定于语言的使用，应该说是根本上决定于思想方法的正确与否。但是思想要用语言来表达，文风就不能不与语言有密切的关系。党和毛主席一向十分重视文风问题，早在1942年毛主席在著名的“反对党八股”一文中就提出过整顿文风的问题，这里边也就着重地讲到了语言的问题。1958年以来，全国范围内掀起了大跃进的高潮，各项建设事业飞速发展，开始了文化技术上的大革命。新的时代尤其需要准确、鲜明、生动的新文风，文风问题再一次提到了重要的位置上来。1958年关于文风问题的讨论开创了书面语言使用上的新局面。
    在学校语文教学方面也体现了建立新文风和实现现代汉语规范化的要求。学生从小学开始就通过语文课学习汉语的基本知识，以培养正确使用祖国语言的能力。大学的现代汉语课也注意了写作实践；文字改革、现代汉语规范化、推广普通话等实际问题也已经列入讲课的内容。
    我们的面前还有繁重的任务
    十年来的汉语规范化工作是有成绩的，但是拿社会主义建设对语言工作的要求来衡量，应该说我们做得还非常不够，还有许多工作等待我们努力。首先，必须创造规范化的主要工具——词典。《现代汉语词典》将要在1960年出版，但是由于汉语历史发展所造成的复杂情况，也由于我们的科学修养不足，这部词典的初版是不大能满足读者对于它的要求的。必须经过不断的修订，让全国的语文工作者都来参加这个修订工作，指出错误和缺点，提出具体的修改建议，才能使它逐渐成为名副其实的规范化的现代汉语词典。现代汉语里有大量的同义词，意义相近而又不尽相同，必须详细分辨，举出正确的和不正确的用法，供写作的人参考。这是在一部普通词典里不容易做到的，因而需要有一本较完备的同义词典。还需要有一部供方言区的人学习普通话参考的方言词典，这部词典不必搜罗很生僻的方言词汇，只要把各大方言区的常用词汇和普通话对照著录，就能给学习普通话的人以莫大便利。这里要特别注意方言词词形跟普通话相同而意义或用法实际上有差别的情形，例如有些方言里的“手”兼指胳膊，“脚”兼指腿，有些方言里把“切”和“削”都叫做“削”。能把这些差别指出来，就能避免让普通话里有用的区别因方言区用法的传入而趋于混淆。普通话的审音工作也需要更积极地进行，一方面要把已经审定的初稿根据各方的反应加以修订，另一方面还得主动去发现读音的分歧而加以审定。在语音规范化工作上，广播电台所负的责任是不小的，应该跟审音委员会保持更密切的联系（在广播里，同一个词在不同的报告员嘴里有不同的读音，现在还是相当常见）。语法学家在这里也有很多工作要作。需要有一部比较完备的现代汉语语法，在某些用例分歧的地方作出合理的建议。词典里边的语法问题也要语法学家帮着解决，例如标注词类这种事，《现代汉语词典》的稿本里没有作，就因为不知道怎样标注才是切合实际，对于读者才真正有用。这些，不过是说明要作的工作还很多。要作好这些工作，我们必须很好地进行学习。1958年资产阶级学术思想批判运动，对于语言学界说来，是一次深刻的自我革命。从运动所揭露的情况看来，语言学界还存在着相当严重的资产阶级思想，还没有做到以辩证唯物主义的立场、观点和方法来指导自己的研究工作，还没有真正做到理论联系实际，自觉地为满足社会主义建设需要服务。跟这十年来工业农业生产战线上的辉煌成就相比较，我们没有任何理由因为取得一点点成绩而自满。我们必须在党的领导下进一步改造思想，在工作中认真贯彻总路线和大跃进的精神，鼓足干劲，力争上游，对人民作出更多更好的贡献。
