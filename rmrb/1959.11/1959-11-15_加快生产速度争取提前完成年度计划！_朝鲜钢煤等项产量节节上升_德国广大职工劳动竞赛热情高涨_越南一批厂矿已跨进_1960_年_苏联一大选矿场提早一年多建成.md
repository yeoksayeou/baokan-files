Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, November 13th: Korean workers are currently fighting to complete this year's production plan ahead of schedule. The output of steel, coal, cement, cloth, and other items are all rising steadily.

Korean steel workers, by striving to improve equipment utilization and shorten smelting time, produced more than 9,900 tons of pig iron and 12,500 tons of steel in October than in August. In the first five days of November, the production of iron and steel increased by 10% to 38% compared to the same period in October. The Kangson Steel Plant, known for producing high-quality steel with electric furnaces, shortened the average smelting time per furnace by one and a half hours in October compared to August, resulting in double the steel production compared to August. The Chongjin Steel Plant, famous for producing special steel, produced 60% more special steel in the first ten months of this year than in the same period last year.

Thanks to the high-speed tunneling movement, the output of Korean coal miners is increasing daily. In October, 156,000 tons more coal was produced than in September. The Sinchang Coal Mine, North Korea's largest and best-quality coal mine, produced more than 88,000 tons of coal in October, greatly exceeding the level of one million tons of coal per year. Workers at the Aoji Coal Mine, North Korea's largest bituminous coal mine, are engaged in a fiery competition to increase coal production by 140,000 tons compared to last year. The "Thousand-Li Horse Tunneling Team" of this coal mine created a high record of tunneling 200 meters in a month.

Good news also came from various cement plants, with an increase of 64,000 tons of cement in October compared to September.

Production in the light industry sector is also rising. Textile mills produced 280,000 meters more cloth in October than in September. The Pyongyang Textile Integrated Factory, North Korea's largest textile industry base, has seen 210 weavers and spinners complete their annual production plans ahead of schedule due to the enthusiastic labor competition. Although the Pyongyang Rubber Factory's production task for this year has more than doubled compared to last year, workers have used their ingenuity to modify machines and improve production efficiency, completing the entire year's production plan ahead of schedule last month.

Xinhua News Agency, November 13th: According to TASS: Workers in the German Democratic Republic are enthusiastically striving to successfully complete the 1959 plan—the first year of the Seven-Year Plan—for developing the national economy. Many industrial enterprises have already completed their annual plans ahead of schedule.

The workers of the Senftenberg brown coal enterprise recently completed this year's coal mining task. The workers of this enterprise are the initiators of the movement to strive for the adoption of more efficient and new labor methods. They plan to overfulfill the annual plan by 11.8% by the end of this year.

Many metallurgical enterprises are also working enthusiastically under the slogan of overfulfilling the annual plan. The blast furnace workers of the Stalinstadt Steel Plant smelted 103,000 tons of pig iron in October, reaching the highest record since the plant was built. The steel workers of the eleven open-hearth furnaces of the Brandenburg Steel Plant have produced about 20,000 tons of steel above the plan.

The workers of the Sassnitz Fishery United Enterprise completed the annual plan on November 9th. The movement to strive for the glorious title of "Socialist Labor Team" played a major role in the successful completion of the plan, with eighty-nine fishing fleets participating in this movement.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, November 14th: Another batch of factories and mines in North Vietnam have overfulfilled this year's production plan, and they have already entered 1960 in terms of production.

The Mao Khe Coal Mine, which has overfulfilled the state plan year after year since the restoration of peace, completed the 1959 production plan 49 days ahead of schedule and overfulfilled it by 0.33% on the 12th of this month, thanks to the courageous and tenacious battle of all the mine's workers.

The Hanoi Pharmaceutical Factory also completed this year's annual plan 49 days ahead of schedule. The labor efficiency of the factory workers is 49% higher than last year.

The Engineering Machinery Factory under the Ministry of Transport and Post and Telecommunications increased its production task by nearly doubled this year compared to last year, but the workers have completed this year's production plan 55 days ahead of schedule.

Amidst the reports of many factories and mines overfulfilling this year's production plan, the lively "Patriotic Competition Movement" is rising. In recent days, some of Vietnam's largest enterprises, such as the Hong Gai Coal Mine, the Cam Pha Coal Mine, and the Nam Dinh Textile Factory, have joined the competition.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 14th: As a result of the creative labor of the workers, the New Krivoi Rog Ore Dressing Integrated Enterprise in the Krivoi Rog Iron Ore District (in southern Ukraine) was completed and put into production on the 5th of this month, fifteen months ahead of schedule.

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union recently sent a telegram to the local leaders and the builders of the New Krivoi Rog Ore Dressing Integrated Enterprise, congratulating them. The congratulatory message expressed confidence that the builders will use the experience of rapid construction to build other ore dressing integrated enterprises in the Krivoi Rog Iron Ore District.

The New Krivoi Rog Ore Dressing Integrated Enterprise is the most advanced ore dressing enterprise in the Soviet Union. Its annual production capacity is 4.5 million tons, and its scale is also at the forefront in Europe. All its production processes are mechanized and automated. The integrated enterprise is controlled by a unified console, and the loading of the ore trucks is checked using radioactive isotopes.

At the open-pit mine of this large-scale integrated enterprise, excavators equipped with eight-cubic-meter hoppers and four-thousand-horsepower mainline diesel locomotives are used. The integrated enterprise is equipped with new multi-axis magnetic separators, which can select concentrate with an iron content of 62% to 64% from ore with an iron content of only 32%. Previously, the iron content of the concentrate selected from this type of ore in the Krivoi Rog mining area did not exceed 59%.

According to the Seven-Year Plan, five large-scale ore dressing enterprises are to be built in the Krivoi Rog Iron Ore District by 1965. The New Krivoi Rog Ore Dressing Integrated Enterprise is the first of them to be put into production. The construction period of this integrated enterprise was originally set at forty months, but as a result, it took only twenty-five months from the start of construction to its completion. This construction speed is twice as fast compared to another ore dressing integrated enterprise with equal production capacity built here in the south in 1956.

    新华社平壤13日电　朝鲜工人目前正在为争取提前完成今年的生产计划而奋战。钢铁、煤炭、水泥、布匹等的产量都在节节上升。
    朝鲜的钢铁工人由于努力提高设备利用率，缩短了冶炼时间，10月份比8月份多生产了九千九百多吨生铁和一万二千五百吨钢。在11月的头五天中，铁和钢的产量比10月份同期增加了10％到38％。用电炉炼优质钢的降仙炼钢厂10月份平均每座炉的炼钢时间比8月份缩短了一个半小时，结果生产了等于8月份的二倍的钢。以生产特殊钢闻名的城津炼钢厂，在今年头十个月中生产的特殊钢材比去年同期增加了60％。
    朝鲜的煤矿工人由于展开了高速度掘进运动，产量日增。10月份比9月份多生产了十五万六千吨煤。朝鲜最大的、煤质最好的新仓煤矿10月生产了八万八千多吨煤，大大超过了这座煤矿年产一百万吨煤的水平。朝鲜最大的烟煤矿——阿吾地煤矿的工人正在为比去年增产十四万吨煤而展开火热的竞赛。这座煤矿的“千里马掘进小组”创造了一个月掘进二百米的高纪录。
    各个水泥厂也传来了捷报，10月份比9月份增产了六万四千吨水泥。
    轻工业部门的生产也正在高涨。各纺织厂10月份比9月份增产了二十八万米布。朝鲜最大的纺织工业基地——平壤纺织综合工厂由于展开了热烈的劳动竞赛，已有二百一十名织布工和纺纱工提前完成了全年的生产计划。平壤橡胶工厂今年的生产任务虽然比去年增加了一倍以上，但是由于工人们开动脑筋，改装了机器，提高了生产效率，早在上个月就已经提前完成了今年全年的生产计划。
    新华社13日电　据塔斯社报道：德意志民主共和国职工正热情高涨地为胜利完成1959年——七年计划的头一年——发展国民经济计划而奋斗。许多工业企业已经提前完成了年度计划。
    森夫滕堡褐煤企业的职工最近完成了今年采煤任务。这个企业的职工是争取采用生产效率更高的、新的劳动方法运动的倡议者。他们计划在今年年底超额11.8％完成年度计划。
    许多冶金企业的职工也正在超额完成年度计划的口号下热情地劳动着。斯大林斯塔特钢铁厂的高炉工人在10月份炼出了十万零三千吨生铁，达到了这个工厂建厂以来的最高纪录。勃兰登堡炼钢厂十一座平炉的炼钢工人，已经超计划生产了两万吨左右的钢。
    萨斯尼支渔业联合企业的职工在11月9日完成了年度计划。争取“社会主义劳动队”光荣称号的运动对这个企业胜利完成计划起了重大作用，有八十九个捕鱼船队参加了这一运动。
    据新华社河内14日电　越南北方又有一批厂矿超额完成今年的生产计划，它们在生产上已跨进1960年。
    和平恢复后年年超额完成国家计划的冒溪煤矿，由于全矿职工奋勇顽强的战斗，本月12日又提前四十九天超额0.33％完成1959年生产计划。
    河内制药厂也提前四十九天完成今年的全年计划。这个工厂工人的劳动效率比去年高49％。
    交通邮电部所属的工程机器厂，今年的生产任务比去年增加近一倍，但职工们已经提前五十五天完成今年的生产计划。
    在许多厂矿超额完成今年生产计划的捷报声中，热火朝天的“爱国竞赛运动”日益高涨。最近几天，越南最大的一些企业如鸿基煤矿、锦普煤矿、南定纺织厂等厂矿纷纷投入了竞赛。
    新华社莫斯科14日电　由于工人们创造性劳动的结果，苏联克里沃罗格铁矿区（在乌克兰南部）的新克里沃罗格选矿联合企业，已经于本月5日提前十五个月建成并投入生产。
    苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议日前为此打电报给当地的领导人和新克里沃罗格选矿联合企业的建设者，向他们表示祝贺。贺电中表示相信，建设者将会利用快速施工的经验来建设克里沃罗格铁矿区的其他选矿联合企业。
    新克里沃罗格选矿联合企业是苏联最完善的选矿企业。它的年生产能力为四百五十万吨，其规模在全欧洲也居于最前列。它的一切生产过程都是机械化和自动化的。联合企业由统一的操纵台操纵，料车的装料情况是利用放射性同位素进行检查的。
    在这个大规模的联合企业的露天采矿场上，使用了配备有八立方米的料斗的挖掘机和四千匹马力的干线柴油内燃机车。联合企业装备了新型多轴磁力选矿机，这种选矿机能从含铁量仅为32％的矿石中选出含铁62％到64％的精矿来。而在这以前，克里沃罗格矿区从这种矿石中选出来的精矿的含铁量最高也没有超过59％。
    根据七年计划，克里沃罗格铁矿区在1965年以前要建成五个大规模选矿企业，新克里沃罗格选矿联合企业是其中投入生产的第一个。这个联合企业的建设期限原订为四十个月，而结果，从开始建设到全部建成总共只用了二十五个月，同1956年在这里南部建成的生产能力相等的另一个选矿联合企业比较，这个建设速度要快一倍。
