Xinhua News Agency, 8th - The seventy-plus representatives of advanced collectives and advanced producers in the petroleum industry attending the National Hero Conference, after several days of experience exchange activities, are all brimming with confidence, stating that they will certainly plant the red flag of the General Line in every corner of the petroleum industry, producing more oil and petroleum products to support the ever-increasing needs of industry, agriculture, transportation, and national defense construction.

On November 6th, all the representatives unanimously passed a proposal calling on petroleum industry workers across the country to first fight hard for the last fifty days of 1959, completing the annual national plan ahead of schedule and in an all-round way, while also preparing for the continued leap forward in 1960, so that next year can achieve a "red opening," "monthly red," and "all-round red." To achieve this goal, the proposal put forward nine suggestions to petroleum workers across the country: Explore more new oil fields and gas fields, increasing the reserves of oil and gas fields; do everything possible to increase crude oil production, improve the level of oil extraction technology, and by the end of this year, increase the utilization rate of oil wells to over 95% and the oil extraction rate to 90%; make full use of various petroleum resources and increase the crude oil recovery rate; strengthen the trial production of new products; accelerate oil field construction and develop local petroleum industries, etc.

The National Petroleum System Advanced Experience Exchange Conference began on November 2nd. The conference was divided into six professional groups: petroleum geology, drilling, oil extraction, synthetic petroleum, crude oil processing, and local small refineries, and exchanged 126 advanced experiences.

Among the experiences shared by the representatives, many are of great significance for solving the key problems of the petroleum industry. The rapid drilling experiences introduced by Sun Defu, Zhang Yunqing, Wang Jinxi, Sun Yuting, and other representatives from Karamay, Yumen Oil Mines, and other places have all continuously created new national records for drilling footage. The well drilling experience introduced by Peng Zuoyou, chief engineer of Yumen Oil Mine, is also very valuable. This spring, they concentrated dozens of drilling rigs in one oil field in Ya'erxia to drill wells, thus breaking through the deep well barrier, accelerating the drilling speed, and improving the drilling quality. In the oil extraction group, the representatives carefully listened to Xue Guobang, the oil extraction team leader of Yumen Oil Mine, introduce the experience of squeezing oil and plugging water, and squeezing oil and plugging gas. This experience can solve the key problems of high oil-gas ratio and water flooding often encountered in oil wells, so that oil wells can always maintain normal production. In addition, the representatives also focused on exchanging and discussing the experience of comprehensive utilization of crude oil introduced by Ma Xiaodi, the representative of Shanghai Refinery, the experience of launching a vigorous technical revolution and technical innovation introduced by Liu Mingshan, the representative of the Dongyuan Oil Workshop of Fushun Petroleum Plant No. 1, and the advanced construction methods of using overall combined hoisting and inverted rolling of oil tanks introduced by the representatives of Lanzhou Refinery during the construction of the plant. In the discussion, many representatives believed that these experiences were very enlightening to them and expressed that they must promote them well after returning.

How to run local small refineries well was a focus of this petroleum system advanced experience exchange conference. The representatives from this field were all representatives of advanced units that originally lacked experience and started from scratch. They spoke very warmly at the meeting, and the discussions were the most enthusiastic. The representatives unanimously agreed that the experience of launching a vigorous mass movement, reducing heavy physical labor in transportation, loading, and screening, and launching vigorous vehicle-ization and indigenous mechanization introduced by Mao Fengrong, the representative of the Jilin Province Nongan Petroleum Group (many small factories), is worthy of great attention. It provides direction and methods for the technical transformation of small refineries. The experience of launching a vigorous comprehensive utilization of oil refining introduced by Wei Qun, the representative of Guangdong Zhongshan Oil Factory, and the experience of using gas safety detectors to reduce gas explosion accidents introduced by Zheng Shouzun, assistant technician of Fujian Fuel Industry Bureau, also made the representatives feel like they had found a treasure. Many people also left each other's addresses, preparing to visit and study on-site after the meeting.

    石油英雄决心把红旗插遍每个角落
    提高技术多产原油支援工农业
    新华社8日讯　出席全国群英大会的七十多位石油工业的先进集体和先进生产者代表，经过几天经验交流活动以后，个个信心百倍，表示一定把总路线的红旗插遍石油工业的各个角落，生产出更多的石油和石油产品来支援工业、农业、交通运输和国防建设事业日益增长的需要。
    11月6日，全体代表一致通过了一项倡议，号召全国石油工业职工首先要大战1959年的最后五十天，提前全面完成今年国家计划，同时要为1960年的继续跃进做好准备，使明年作到“开门红”、“月月红”、“满堂红”。为了达到这个目的，倡议书向全国石油职工提出了九点建议：勘探出更多的新油田、新气田，增加油田和气田的储量；千方百计地增产原油，提高采油技术水平，在今年年底以前，使油井的利用率达到95％以上，采油率达到90％；充分利用各种石油资源，提高原油回收率；加强新产品的试制工作；加快油田建设和发展地方石油工业等。
    全国石油系统先进经验交流会议是在11月2日开始的。会议分石油地质、钻井、采油、人造石油、原油加工、地方小炼油厂六个专业，分别交流了一百二十六条先进经验。
    代表们交流的经验中，有很多对解决当前石油工业的关键问题，具有很重要的意义。来自克拉玛依、玉门油矿等地的孙德福、张云清、王进喜、孙玉亭等代表介绍的快速钻井经验，都曾连续创造钻井进尺的全国新纪录。玉门油矿总工程师彭佐猷介绍的打井经验，也很有价值。今年春天他们在鸭儿峡集中几十部钻机在一个油田里打井，因而闯过了深井关，加快了钻探速度，还提高了钻探质量。在采油小组上，代表们认真听取了玉门油矿采油队长薛国邦介绍的挤油堵水、挤油堵气的经验。这一经验可以解决油井中常常遇到的油气比升高和油井水淹的关键问题，使油井经常保持正常生产。此外，代表们还着重交流和讨论了上海炼油厂代表马小弟介绍的综合利用原油的经验，抚顺石油一厂东原油车间代表刘明山介绍的大闹技术革命和技术革新的经验，兰州炼油厂代表介绍的在建厂中采用整体组合吊装和油罐倒装卷装的先进施工方法等。在讨论中，不少代表都认为这些经验对他们有很大的启发，表示回去以后，一定要很好推广。
    如何办好地方小炼油厂，是这次石油系统先进经验交流会议的一个重点。来自这方面的代表都是原来缺乏经验，白手起家的先进单位的代表，他们在会上谈得十分亲切，讨论得也最热烈。代表们一致认为吉林省农安石油群（许多小厂）代表毛凤荣介绍的大搞群众运动，减轻运输、装担、筛选等方面的笨重体力劳动，大搞车子化、土机械化的经验值得十分重视。它为小炼油厂进行技术改造提供了方向和方法。广东中山油厂代表魏群介绍的大搞炼油的综合利用，和福建燃料工业局助理技术员郑守樽介绍的用瓦斯安全测定器减少瓦斯爆炸事故的经验，也使代表们如获至宝。很多人还相互留下了地址，准备会议结束以后，还要到现场专门访问学习。
