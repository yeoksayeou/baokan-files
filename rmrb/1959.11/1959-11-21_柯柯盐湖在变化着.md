From Afar:

    The Keke Salt Lake is Changing
    Since the People's Daily published "Notes from Keke Salt Lake" in August this year, many friends from the mainland have written to inquire about how the Keke Salt Lake is changing now. Friends, let me tell you! The Keke Salt Lake, like all parts of the country, is also changing rapidly. If you come now, you can take the train directly to Xining and get off; if you come next year, you can take the train directly to the gate of the salt factory.
    When you come here, you will see the rosy faces of the salt miners laughing, and the strong arms waving. As we move and work, the white crystalline salt is piled into salt mountains. Looking from afar, the lake and mountain scenery is so beautiful, like crystal engraving, like ivory carving.
    As early as 1957, the Salt Source Exploration Team of the Ministry of Light Industry discovered that the reserves of crude salt in Keke Salt Lake were extremely rich, reaching 1 billion tons, with high quality, containing more than 90% sodium chloride, exceeding the quality of sea salt. In addition, the future Lanqing Railway passes closely to the north of the salt lake, and the convenient transportation is more conducive to building a mechanized salt factory here. In January this year, the factory leaders brought tents and grain, overcame obstacles, and drove away the severe cold, settling down on the banks of the salt lake. Later, personnel came from all over the country; they came from the "Land of Abundance", from the "Land of Fish and Rice", from the "Land of Tea and Mulberry", from Shandong, Henan, from…; there were students with childishness, there were honest housewives, there were young officers, there were ordinary soldiers, there were…. Soon, letters of determination and guarantees, like snowflakes in the sky, everyone was determined to take root and settle down in the grassland salt lake, and work in the salt lake for a lifetime. One letter of determination read: "Comrades, don't laugh, I love the salt lake more than I love a girl. It's not that I have a preference for the salt lake, but because the salt lake has a strong attraction to me…."
    The site of our future salt factory has been selected on the north bank of the salt lake, more than ten kilometers away from the western artificial mining area.
    Building the Keke Salt Factory is like drawing a picture on blank paper. There is nothing here, and everything must be done by everyone. We built dormitories ourselves under the conditions of lack of materials and transportation difficulties. Before the National Day, half of the workers had moved into new houses. Now, new brick kilns are already smoking. The number of bricks made by each person every day has increased from two hundred to five hundred, six hundred, and even more than a thousand. Kiln after kiln of bricks were fired, some red, some blue, and they were also piled into mountains.
    In August this year, our salt factory opened the first spare-time middle school on the grassland. Many people signed up, including young people and adults over thirty years old. At the opening ceremony, the factory party committee secretary asked us to study hard, so that when the mechanized salt factory is built in the future, everyone can become an excellent skilled worker. At that time, whether it is a combined salt harvester, a tractor driver, or a train dispatcher, everyone must master certain skills. The spare-time middle school we run is to train such people. Now we take two hours to attend classes after work every day. We also review the greatest common divisor and the least common multiple when we rest at the construction site. Sometimes we draw a simple diagram of an internal combustion engine on the ground and argue endlessly.
    Our recreational activities have also been launched. This year's National Day, the club's amateur theater troupe rehearsed many programs. The Henan opera group rehearsed "Broken Bridge", "Small Garden", etc., and the opera "Song of Fishermen at Sea" was directed very seriously. "Salt Worker Dance" appeared with a new look at the National Day evening party. It is our collective creation and is constantly being revised and perfected.
    We sing today and also look forward to a better tomorrow. Tomorrow is not something far away. Combined salt harvesters will roar on the vast white salt lake, trains will run in the factory area, whistles will sound, and smoke will billow, transporting the white treasure salt to all parts of the motherland.
    Two and a half months ago, we overfulfilled the annual production task by more than a thousand tons ahead of schedule. At that time, we decided to produce another 110,000 tons of crude salt, completely breaking the convention of "not being able to go to sea for production in winter", and opening the way for year-round production in the future. Now, a new production upsurge has been set off in the entire factory. The salt lake is already in severe winter, and the pasture around the salt lake has withered. The basin has become a golden and silver-white world. On the morning of October 28, the thermometer mercury column shrank to minus fifteen degrees, and the biting cold wind was blowing. However, if you take a look at the hot and bustling scene here, you will forget that it is winter. The severe cold has been melted away by our production upsurge.
    Friends, forgive me for only being able to write here, because I have to go to the salt lake to dig salt tomorrow morning!

### 柯柯盐湖在变化着

    柯柯盐湖在变化着
    自从今年8月人民日报发表了“柯柯盐湖札记”以后，很多内地朋友来信询问柯柯盐湖现在变得怎样了。朋友，告诉你吧！柯柯盐湖跟全国各地一样，也在一日千里地变化着。如果你现在来的话，坐火车直接到西宁下车；如果是明年来，就可以直接坐火车到盐厂门口下车了。
    来到这里，你会看到采盐的工人们一张张紫红的脸膛在欢笑，一双双粗健的手臂在挥动，就在我们手舞身转中，洁白的晶盐堆成了一座座盐山。远远望去，湖光山景太美丽了，如水晶名刻，赛象牙精雕。
    还在1957年的时候，轻工业部盐源勘探队就探明柯柯盐湖原盐藏量异常丰富，达十亿吨，品位高，含氯化钠达90％以上，超过海盐的质量，加上未来的兰青铁路紧通过盐湖的北面，交通便利，更有利于在这里兴建机械化采盐厂。今年1月间，厂里领导干部就带了帐篷和粮食，斩荆截棘，驱逐严寒，在盐湖之畔安了家。以后，人员从各地源源而来；他们来自“天府之国”，来自“鱼米之乡”，来自“茶桑胜地”，来自山东、河南，来自……；有带有孩子气的学生，有忠厚的家庭妇女，有年轻的军官，有普通一兵，有……。不久，决心书、保证书、犹如满天雪飘，每个人都决心在草原盐湖扎下根，安下心，在盐湖干一辈子。有张决心书上这样写着：“同志你们别见笑，我爱盐湖胜过爱姑娘，不是我对盐湖有偏爱，实因盐湖对我引力强……。
    我们未来的盐厂厂址已经选定在盐湖的北浜，离西面人工开采区还有十多公里。
    建设柯柯盐厂，等于白纸描图，这里什么也没有，一切都得靠我们大家动手干起来。我们在缺材料、运输困难的条件下，自己动手盖宿舍。在国庆前已经有半数工人住上新屋。现在，一座座新的砖窑已经在冒烟了。每人每天打砖坯的数量从二百块上升到五百、六百，还超过一千块。一窑窑砖烧成了，有红的，有青的，也堆成一座座山。
    今年8月份，我们盐厂开办了草原上第一所业余中学，报名的人很多，除了我们年轻人外，还有三十岁以上的壮年人。开学典礼上，厂党委书记要我们好好学习，将来机械化盐厂建成后，个个都当个出色的技术工人。到那时，不论是联合采盐机手、拖拉机手或是火车调度员都要掌握一定的技术。我们办的业余中学就是为了培养这样的一些人。现在我们每天工作后，抽出两小时上课。我们在工地休息时也温习最大公约数和最小公倍数。有时在地上画了一个内燃机简图，争论不休。
    我们的文娱活动也搞起来了。今年国庆节，俱乐部业余剧团排练了好多节目。豫剧组排练了“断桥”、“小花园”等，歌剧“海上渔歌”，导演得非常认真。“盐工舞”在国庆晚会上以新的面目出现，它是我们的集体创作，在不断修改完美中。
    我们在歌唱今天，也向往着美好的明天。明天，并不是什么遥远的事情，联合采盐机将在白茫茫的盐湖上轰鸣着，火车将在厂区内奔驰着，汽笛长鸣，烟流滚滚，把白色的宝盐输向祖国各地。
    两个半月以前，我们已超额一千多吨，提前完成了全年生产任务。当时，我们又决定再生产原盐十一万吨，彻底打破了“冬季不能下海生产”的陈规，为以后常年生产打开道路。现在，全厂已掀起了新的生产高潮。盐湖已是严冬了，盐湖四周的牧草已经枯黄，盆地成了金黄银白的世界。10月28日早晨，温度计水银柱缩到零下十五度，刮着刺骨的寒风。但是，你如果看一看这里的热气腾腾的场面，你就会忘掉这里是冬天。严寒在我们生产高潮中热化了。
    朋友，原谅我只能写到这里，因为明天早上还要下盐湖去挖盐呢！
