    The Thunder Doesn't Stop
    ——Watching the Ballet "The Road of Thunder" by the Bolshoi Theatre of the Soviet Union
    You Huihai
    As we joyfully and enthusiastically celebrate the 10th anniversary of the founding of our country and the 42nd anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution, the Soviet government has sent the world-renowned Bolshoi Ballet of the Soviet Union to visit and perform in our country, fully demonstrating the growing brotherly friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people and the continuous development of cultural exchanges between the two countries. Soviet ballet art follows the path of socialist realism in creation, inheriting and developing the excellent traditions of Russian classical ballet and folk dance with a long history, becoming a model of world ballet art. This time, the Bolshoi Ballet of the Soviet Union performed the famous ballets "Swan Lake," "Giselle," "The Stone Flower," "The Road of Thunder," and many wonderful fragments in our country, which were warmly welcomed by the vast audience in various parts of our country.
    Not long ago, I watched "The Road of Thunder," which was rehearsed by Soviet ballet artists for their visit to China, and was deeply moved. From this ballet, we can clearly see the new development of Soviet ballet art. This is a modern ballet on the theme of anti-colonialism and racial discrimination. Through the story of the love between Lenny, a young black college student, and Sally, a white girl, who are killed by white racists in a storm, the ballet profoundly exposes the heinous policy of racial discrimination and reflects the boundless hatred and resistance of the broad masses of people towards imperialism.
    The conflict and theme presented by the ballet are extremely important conflicts and themes in our contemporary life; millions of people who live in suffering under the shadow of imperialism and racism are waging fierce struggles for independence and liberation. It is precisely because of the infinite sympathy and support for this struggle that the artists are encouraged and prompted to enthusiastically reflect the reality of this struggle with their art. K. Karayev, the composer of "The Road of Thunder," Yu. Slonimsky, the screenwriter, and K. M. Sergeyev, the choreographer, successfully summarized the progressive ideas and complex plot of the long novel of the same name by South African writer Peter Abrahams into vivid ballet images with their artistic talents.
    Lenny, a young black man created by Soviet People's Artist K. M. Sergeyev, is a proud, kind, and upright image. From the first scene of the university graduation party, he showed the vigorous and optimistic temperament of this African youth. He returned to his hometown with the feeling of dedicating everything to his hometown and people. Sergeyev vividly expressed the young man's excitement of returning to his home after a long absence. The short performance was full of love for his homeland and people.
    However, the conflict began like this: during a happy meeting with his fellow villagers, white thugs insulted him by knocking off his graduation cap, but he would not yield. At this time, he stood still and answered the first blow with a firm look.
    Colonialists are used to mocking themselves. They write huge "THE BEST" (meaning: the most upper class, the most noble) on the high walls. However, it is these so-called "upper class" and "noble" hands that are doing the most cruel and sinful acts in the world; they use bribery and instigation among blacks, trying to humiliate people with petty favors, whitewash and maintain their exploitation and rule. However, the upright Lenny bravely exposed the despicable act of buying labor, thereby deepening the development of the contradiction.
    However, the biggest challenge to the racists, Lenny's bravest act, was that he dared to break through the shackles of the racists' laws, accepted the love of the white girl Sally, and even resisted without fear and was killed with Sally. The actor successfully shaped the noble and sympathetic image of this role.
    Sergeyev showed the deep inner world of this young black man with the drama of movements and the depiction of dance images. Many of his performances were clear and powerful. For example, at the end of the third scene of the second act, his huge and powerful hands were placed on the shoulders of Marco, who had rescued him, with friendship and gratitude. That was an action full of language! When he and Sally met for the second time, the pas de deux, which was almost two monologues, expressed their different moods. They yearned for mutual closeness, but it seemed that an invisible resistance was between them, making them unable to touch each other. This feature of the dance expressed the social obstacles their love suffered. As for when they meet again on the grassland, they have broken free from this emotional restraint. The uninhibited and enthusiastic emotions conveyed by the highly classical techniques of the pas de deux showed their bravery and freedom at this moment.
    The image of Lenny created by Sergeyev is complete and mature. He embodies a new generation of the African continent who loves his homeland and people, and is kind, sincere, and enthusiastic. He embodies the progressive demands for liberation and the thought of a head-on and merciless conflict with the colonialists. Heroism and bravery are the perfect characteristics of this young man, and the whole image is full of the simple and noble qualities of black people.
    Sally is a difficult role to play. This is due to her social status in the play. She needs to embody many complex and contradictory personalities and emotions. People's Artist Lepeshinskaya vividly showed the brave act of this pure girl breaking through the influence of racial prejudice and falling in love with Lenny. She would rather die and be destroyed than yield, which shows the positive and valuable character of this white girl.
    Sally, played by Lepeshinskaya, is pure and lyrical. Through her night walk on the grassland, her second meeting with Lenny, her solitary thoughts of Lenny, and her running to the grassland to find Lenny, this series of monologues describing the characters' psychology deeply expresses the deep affection of this thoughtful and lyrical girl; in the second scene of the third act, the flight of love with Lenny on the grassland, although this freedom is only momentary and fleeting, she and Lenny use their whole hearts to enjoy this unconstrained freedom. In this dance, they showed the fearless vitality. This People's Artist showed her highly classical technical cultivation in the pas de deux on the grassland. In the slow-paced music that gradually and continuously grows upwards like waves, her dance skills and the passion of the modeling also become more urgent and reach a true emotional climax step by step. This pas de deux is extremely perfect.
    Lepeshinskaya clearly expressed the complex thoughts and feelings of this girl with her delicate and affectionate performance, completing the creation of a difficult dramatic image.
    Lenny and Sally are not alone. Walking in the forefront of "The Road of Thunder" with them are the strong black teacher Marco (played by Russian Soviet Honored Artist Levashov) and Fanny (played by Yu. G. Scott) – they love Lenny and will spare no effort to sacrifice themselves to protect the persecuted Lenny; after Lenny's death, they called on people to take action. They left the audience with hope and faith in the play. The white landlord Heto, played by Russian Honored Artist Colin, also successfully exposed the colonialists' mean, despicable, brutal, and inhuman nature.
    The entire ballet fully utilizes and develops African folk dance materials, giving it a rich black local flavor; in the joyful scene after Lenny returns home, many folk dances with African characteristics and flowing and smooth tones are arranged. The wavy undulations of the body and the movement characteristics of the shoulders and waist form a distinctive scene of black people's happy life. The rough dance, close to the Voudou religion (African religion), that appeared in the scene of recruiting labor strongly shows the life and customs of the people of the African continent. Sometimes, we will also see some more sad and mournful imprints in the dance movements; however, this is the reflection of the reality of life in the dance. The suffering people living under the oppression of the imperialist colonial system cannot but bring sorrow and pain into their art, intertwined with that optimistic and joyful emotion.
    The creation of the ballet has been a huge labor and achievement in collecting and developing African dance, because these national characteristic dances have been combined with the elements of ballet. Moreover, national dance is no longer a simple folk ritual here, it has been closely combined with the dramatic task and is a means of emotional color for the character image.
    Composer Kara Karayev wrote a ballet music of great enthusiasm, with strong passion and novel, rich and diverse images (diverse contrast and change of dance color and character color), making the language of this musical work so prominent and clear in its ideology. The lyricism of the leading positive characters, or the tragic heroic passion, contrasts with the grotesque of the condemned evil forces, and is constantly developed in dramatic conflicts. This ballet music is extremely danceable, and it is extremely successful in inheriting the tradition of classical ballet music and giving the dance a beautiful image. More importantly, these music is saturated with a kind of cordial realistic emotion—truly depicting the true emotions of the modern life of the protagonists in the play that are understood and sympathized by us. The music is rich in national characteristics and colors. Many beautiful black song melodies and special dance rhythms illustrate the results of the composer's long-term and focused research on black music.
    The art design of the ballet provides a clear typical environment and atmosphere for the ballet. Whether it is the symbolic decorative curtain with black and white circles, or the low houses of those African residents, the empty grassland before the storm, or the colonialists' magnificent mansions, they all have a successful stylized picture summary, and at the same time, they are artistic ideas that are closely combined with the dramatic tasks of the whole play.
    The achievement of "The Road of Thunder" is the achievement of all comrades of the Bolshoi Ballet under the inspiration of progressive ideological enthusiasm. They have once again proved the positive role of ballet art in expressing the major themes of modern life, reflecting and inspiring the progressive ideas and struggles of mankind. After watching "The Road of Thunder," we will all get a clear impression, as shown in the ending of this ballet:
    The heroic African people are advancing,
    The thunder has not stopped!

    雷电没有停息
    ——看苏联国家大剧院舞剧“雷电的道路”
    游惠海
    当我们以无比欢欣鼓舞的心情，热烈庆祝我国建国十周年和伟大的十月社会主义革命四十二周年的时候，苏联政府派遣了享有世界盛誉的苏联国家大剧院芭蕾舞团来我国进行访问演出，充分表明了中苏两国人民的兄弟般的友谊日益增涨和两国文化交流的不断发展。苏联芭蕾艺术遵循了社会主义现实主义的创作道路，继承和发扬了历史悠久的俄罗斯古典芭蕾艺术和民间舞蹈的优秀传统，成为世界芭蕾艺术的典范。苏联国家大剧院芭蕾舞团这一次在我国演出的著名舞剧“天鹅湖”、“吉赛尔”、“宝石花”、“雷电的道路”以及许多精彩的片断，受到了我国各地广大观众的热烈欢迎。
    不久前我看了苏联芭蕾艺术家为了访问中国排演的“雷电的道路”，受到很大的感动。从这个舞剧我们可以清楚地看到苏联芭蕾艺术的新的发展。这是一个表现反殖民制度和种族歧视的现代题材的舞剧。这个舞剧通过黑人青年大学生连尼和白种姑娘莎丽的相爱，在暴风雨中被白色种族主义者杀害的故事，深刻地揭露了种族歧视的罪恶政策，反映了广大人民对于帝国主义的无比憎恨和反抗。
    舞剧所展示的冲突和主题，是我们当代生活极其重大的冲突和主题；千百万在帝国主义、种族主义的阴影下痛苦生活的人们，正在进行着要求独立解放的激烈斗争。正是由于对这个斗争的无限同情与支持，才鼓舞和促使了艺术家们热情地以自己的艺术来反映这个斗争生活的真实。“雷电的道路”的作曲卡·卡拉耶夫，编剧尤·斯洛尼姆斯基和编导康·米·谢尔盖耶夫以自己的艺术才华，成功地把南非作家彼·阿伯拉罕斯同名长篇小说的进步思想和复杂的情节概括成鲜明的舞剧形象。
    由苏联人民演员康·米·谢尔盖耶夫创造的黑人青年连尼是一个具有自豪感的善良正直的形象，从第一场大学毕业晚会上起，就展现出这个非洲青年的朝气勃勃的乐观的气质。他怀着把自己一切献给家乡和人民的情感回到自己的故乡。谢尔盖耶夫生动地表达了这个青年久别归来回到自己家门的激动心情，简短的表演中充满了对自己乡土和人民的热爱的感情。
    然而，冲突却是这样开始的，在同乡亲们欢乐的会见中，白人暴徒们以打落他的学位帽对他进行侮辱，但是，他是不会屈服的，这时他屹立着不动，以坚定的神态回答了第一次的打击。
    殖民主义者是惯于嘲弄自己的，他们在高高的墙头上写着巨大的“THEBEST”（含义是：最上流的，最高尚的），然而，就是这一些所谓“上流”“高尚”的手，干着人世最残酷和罪恶的行为；他们在黑人中利用收买挑拨，企图以小恩小惠使人屈辱，粉饰和维护他们的剥削统治。但是正直的连尼勇敢地揭穿了这个收买劳动力的卑鄙的行径，由此加深了矛盾的发展。
    但是，对种族主义者最大的挑战，连尼的最勇敢的行为，是他敢于冲破种族主义者的法律的束缚，接受了白种姑娘莎丽的爱情，直至他毫不畏怯地反抗而同莎丽一同被害。演员成功地塑造了这一角色崇高的令人同情的形象。
    谢尔盖耶夫以动作的戏剧性和舞蹈形象的刻划，展现了这个黑人青年深刻的内心世界，他的许多表演都清晰有力，例如二幕三场结束时，他那一双巨大的有力的手友爱感激地按在援救过他的马柯的肩上，那是充满了多少语言的动作！当他和莎丽第二次相遇时那段近乎两个独白的双人舞，表达了各自不同的心情，他们渴求着相互的接近，然而，似乎有一股无形的阻力横在他们中间，使他们无法相触，这段舞蹈的这一特点表达了他们的爱情所受到的社会障碍。至于在草原上，他们再度相会时，他们已经摆脱了这种情感上的束缚了，双人舞通过高度古典技巧传达出的奔放的热烈的情绪，表明了他们此刻的勇敢和自由。
    谢尔盖耶夫创造的连尼的形象是完整而成熟的，他体现了一个热爱乡土和人民的善良、真挚、热情的非洲大陆新生的一代，在他身上体现了进步的要求解放的思想与殖民主义者的正面无情的冲突。英雄气概与勇敢是这个年青人完美的特点，而整个形象却是充满了黑人的朴实的高贵品质。
    莎丽是一个很难演的角色，这是由于她在这个戏中所处的社会地位所造成的，她需要体现许多复杂矛盾的性格和情感。人民演员列皮辛斯卡娅鲜明地表现了这个纯真的少女冲破种族成见的影响而同连尼相爱的勇敢的行为，她宁可死亡和毁灭，也不屈服，这就说明了这个白种姑娘的正面可贵的性格。
    列皮辛斯卡娅扮演的莎丽是纯洁抒情的，通过她的草原夜游、和连尼的第二次相遇、独自地思念连尼、飞奔向草原寻找连尼这一连串的描写人物心理的独白性的舞蹈，深深地表现了这个善于思考、抒情的姑娘的深情；三幕二场在草原上和连尼的爱情的飞翔，虽然这种自由只是片刻的、瞬间的，但是她和连尼是用全部心灵来享受这种毫无束缚的自由的，他们在这一段舞蹈中显示了无所畏怯的生命力。这位人民演员在草原上的双人舞中显示了她的高度古典技巧的修养，在慢板的像波涛逐步不断增长向上的音乐中，她的舞蹈技巧和造型的激情也一步紧迫一步而达到真正的情感的高潮，这段双人舞是极为完美的。
    列皮辛斯卡娅用她的细腻的、深情的表演清晰地表现了这个少女的复杂的思想感情的发展，完成了一个艰巨的戏剧形象的创造。
    连尼和莎丽不是孤单的，同他们走在“雷电的道路”的前列的还有坚强的黑人教师马柯（俄罗斯苏维埃功勋演员列瓦绍夫饰）和芳妮（尤·格·斯科特饰）——他们热爱连尼，任何时候都不惜牺牲自己来维护受迫害的连尼；连尼死后，是他们号召人们行动起来，他们在剧中给观众留下希望和信念。俄罗斯功勋艺术家柯林所演的白人地主赫脱也成功地揭发了殖民者的卑贱下流和凶残成性的惨无人道。
    整个舞剧充分地运用和发展了非洲的民族舞蹈素材，使它具备了浓郁的黑人风土人情的特色；在连尼回家以后展开的欢乐场面中，安排了许多有非洲特色的、基调奔放流畅的民间舞蹈，那些身体波浪形的起伏，肩与腰的活动特征形成有特色的黑人的欢乐生活的场景。在招募劳动力那一场出现的粗犷的接近于伏陀教（非洲的宗教）舞蹈，强烈地表明了非洲大陆人民的生活和风俗特征。有时，我们也会看见舞蹈动作中一些比较伤感的哀怨情调的烙印；然而这是生活的真实在舞蹈中的反映，生活在帝国主义殖民制度压迫下的苦难人民，不能不把哀怨和痛苦带到他们的艺术中，和那种乐观的欢乐的情感交错在一起。
    舞剧的创作在收集和发展非洲舞蹈所费的劳动和成就是巨大的，因为这些民族特色的舞蹈已和芭蕾舞的因素结合在一起了。而且民族舞蹈在这里已不是单纯的民间仪式，它已经紧密地和戏剧任务结合，作为人物形象的情感色彩的手段了。
    作曲家卡拉·卡拉耶夫写出的是一部巨大热情的舞剧音乐，强烈的激情和新颖的丰富多样的形象（舞蹈色彩与人物性格色彩的多样对比变化），使这一部音乐作品的语言的思想性是那样的突出和鲜明。舞剧中主导的正面人物的抒情、或者是悲剧性的英雄气概的激情，和被谴责的邪恶力量的怪诞形成对比，而且是在戏剧性的冲突中不断得到发展的。这部舞剧音乐极富于舞蹈性，它在继承古典芭蕾音乐传统给予舞蹈以优美的形象上是极为成功的。更重要的还在于这些音乐中饱和着一种亲切的现实主义的感情——真切地描绘了为我们所理解和同情的剧中主人翁的现代生活的真实感情。音乐的富有民族特性和色彩，许多动听的黑人歌曲旋律和特殊的舞蹈节奏，说明了作曲家长期专心研究黑人音乐进行创作的成果。
    舞剧的美术设计为舞剧提供了一个鲜明的典型环境和气氛。无论是带有黑白圈的象征性的装饰幕，或者是那些非洲居民的矮屋，暴风雨前荒漠空旷的草原，殖民主的华丽的大厦都有着成功的风格化的画面概括，同时是和全剧的戏剧任务紧密结合的艺术构思。
    “雷电的道路”的成就，是大剧院芭蕾舞团全体同志在进步思想热情鼓舞下的成就，他们又一次证明了芭蕾艺术在表现现代生活的重大题材，反映和鼓舞人类的进步思想和斗争所起的积极作用。我们看完“雷电的道路”，都会获得一个鲜明的印象，正如这个舞剧的结尾所展示的：
    英雄的非洲人民在前进，
    雷电并没有停息！
