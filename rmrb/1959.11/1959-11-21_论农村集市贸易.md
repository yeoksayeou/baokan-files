Rural Market Trade is a Newly Emerging Form of Rural Trade

Recently, while strengthening the purchasing and marketing work of state-owned commerce, promoting the production and sales contract system, and convening material exchange meetings at all levels, various parts of the country have been developing rural market trade in a guided and planned manner. This rural market trade is a new form of trade that has emerged in our country's rural areas after the realization of people's communes and the great development of agricultural production. It serves to promote the development of production, expand commodity circulation, and meet the production and consumption needs of farmers.

This form of trade has the following characteristics:

First, it is a trade based primarily on socialist public ownership and socialist collective ownership under the centralized leadership of the state. After the realization of people's communes in rural areas, non-socialist economic components were further eliminated, and the socialist collective economy was consolidated and developed. This change has greatly changed the economic landscape of our country's rural areas. The rural market trade that has emerged under this new situation is an integral part of our country's unified socialist market.

Second, not all commodities are exchanged in the market trade, but only a portion of them, mainly the third category of materials that are not included in the state's planned purchase and sale, as well as some sideline products and handicrafts produced by the members of the people's communes, their families, and individuals. This kind of scattered commodity accounts for a small proportion of the total commodity exchange in the market, but the variety is extremely large. Therefore, rural market trade is a supplement and assistant to the state's planned market, and it is a form of exchange adopted by socialist commerce in organizing the distribution of certain scattered commodities.

Third, this kind of rural market is mainly a place where producers directly sell certain scattered products and purchase the daily necessities they need. The main participants in market purchase and sale activities are people's communes, production teams, and commune members, as well as state-owned commercial departments and other socialist units; as for small traders organized by state-owned commercial organizations, they can only participate in market purchase and sale activities in accordance with the approved scope of operation. Therefore, it can also be seen from the members participating in rural market trade that this commodity exchange is no longer a form used by the socialist economy to connect with the capitalist economy or the individual economy, but as a means of connection within the socialist economy.

Fourth, this form of trade develops the advantages of the original market, which has long occupied a fairly important position in my country's rural economic life, and uses this form of trade, which has historical habits and traditions and is familiar to the farmers, to serve the organization of the economic life of the new socialist countryside. At the same time, we know that convening material exchange meetings at all levels and in various forms is a good way to invigorate commodity circulation and strengthen regional ties. The rural market is actually a form of material exchange between communes, production teams, and commune members.

Judging from the situation in various places, this market trade not only further invigorates material exchange and promotes the development of diversified operations of the people's communes, but also expands the purchasing and marketing activities of state-owned commerce, making it easier for the state to organize and lead rural economic life. For example, after Daming, Hejian, Dingxian, Yongnian and other counties in Hebei Province launched market trade, many markets had as many as one or two thousand kinds of commodities, with a turnover of tens of thousands of yuan, which greatly facilitated the exchange between production teams and commune members to adjust surpluses and make up for deficiencies. Among them, the commodities sold by individual commune members also accounted for a considerable proportion; the purchases of state-owned commerce in some places also increased month by month in the markets. After the development of market trade, it has played a positive role in stabilizing market prices. According to statistics from 12 counties in Sichuan Province, such as Xuyong, Daxian, and Tongjiang, the prices of some third-category materials in September and October were about 15% to 20% lower than the average in July. This new form of trade has shown its positive role in my country's current rural economic life and is welcomed by people's communes, production teams, and the broad masses of commune members.

The Role of Rural Market Trade in Developing the National Economy and Strengthening the Worker-Peasant Alliance

The emergence of rural market trade is by no means an accidental phenomenon, but an inevitable product of the development of the objective situation, and it is also needed by the state, communes, and the masses for a considerable period of time in the future. Due to the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production last year and the continued leap forward this year, the living standards of urban and rural people have also been rapidly improved. The development of production and the growth of demand inevitably require further expansion of commodity exchange and invigoration of urban-rural exchange. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China pointed out in the "Resolution on Several Issues Concerning People's Communes": "In a necessary historical period in the future, the commodity production of people's communes, as well as the commodity exchange between the state and communes, and between communes, must have a great development." Rural market trade is precisely developed in response to the requirements of this situation.

There is no doubt that after the realization of people's communes in rural areas, the planning of commodity exchange has been strengthened day by day. The commodity exchange of people's communes is mainly carried out through state-owned commerce, and production and sales contracts have become the main form. In the future, it is still necessary to continue to expand the purchase and sale of state-owned commerce, promote the contract system, and constantly strengthen the planning of commodity exchange, so as to better realize the economic integration between urban and rural areas and between industry and agriculture. Only in this way can we promote the vigorous development of planned socialist construction.

Then, why is it necessary to organize rural market trade? Here, we must see the following situations: First, under the policy of simultaneously promoting self-sufficient production and commodity production in people's communes, based on the ever-increasing needs of industrial and agricultural production development and the improvement of urban and rural people's living standards, the commodity production part will grow faster than the self-sufficient production part. In particular, the people's communes have shown their unparalleled superiority in comprehensively developing agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, and diversified operations have greatly developed. Therefore, not only is the volume of commodities growing rapidly, but the variety of commodities is also increasing day by day. Second, at the current stage, in terms of ownership of the means of production in people's communes, the ownership at the production team level is basic, the ownership at the commune level is partial, and the production team also has a small part of ownership. Therefore, not only between the state and communes, and between communes, but also between production teams and even production teams, some necessary commodity exchange and adjustment are needed. Third, in addition to collective operation, commune members also have their own small family sideline occupations. The commodity production part of this family sideline occupation will also participate in the scope of commodity exchange.

As mentioned above, in my country's rural areas, due to the realization of people's communes, productivity has been greatly developed, and due to the people's communes' implementation of the policy of simultaneously promoting industry and agriculture, the policy of comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, and the policy of simultaneously promoting self-sufficient production and commodity production, commodity production has greatly developed, and the quantity and variety of commodities are large. Among them, there are large and important commodities, as well as scattered and relatively minor commodities; there are first-category or second-category materials, as well as third-category materials; there are commodities collectively operated by communes and production teams, as well as commodities individually operated by commune members; there are commodities transported and sold over long distances, as well as commodities produced and sold locally. Can all of these many commodities be exchanged through the planned purchase and sale of state-owned commerce? Obviously, this is neither possible nor necessary. State-owned commerce should mainly implement planned purchase and sale of those important and relatively large commodities. As for those scattered small commodities with small output value and many varieties, they need to be exchanged through more other appropriate forms. Rural market trade is developed based on this need. This form is also more conducive to exploring sources of goods and expanding the state's purchase of rural products.

It must also be recognized that the development of rural market trade is not only economically necessary, but also has important political significance. According to Lenin's principle, commodity exchange is an indispensable link in economically consolidating the worker-peasant alliance. "If a systematic commodity exchange or product exchange is not implemented between industry and agriculture, the proletariat and peasants cannot establish a correct relationship during the transition period from capitalism to socialism, and it is impossible to establish a very solid economic alliance." (Resolution of the Tenth National Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) on the New Economic Policy) Therefore, developing rural market trade while expanding the planned purchase and sale of state-owned commerce to better meet the needs of farmers for commodity purchase and sale is required by the commercial work to implement the Party's "walking on two legs" policy. It is of great significance for invigorating rural economic life, promoting the development of production, and further economically consolidating the alliance between the working class and the peasants.

Scope of Commodities and Price Policy for Rural Market Trade

In order to better guide the development of rural market trade, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council issued the "Instructions on Organizing Rural Market Trade" on September 23 this year, which clearly stipulates the main issues such as the scope of commodities and prices in market trade. Obviously, only by correctly implementing these instructions can the healthy development of market trade be promoted.

The issue of the scope of commodity transactions is an important issue that needs to be correctly resolved first in the work of organizing market trade. This issue is actually to place this form of trade in what position in the commodity circulation of rural areas. On this issue, there are two deviations: One is that it is not recognized that rural market trade is still an indispensable form in the current commodity circulation in rural areas and its role in developing diversified operations. It is emphasized that all commodities are purchased and sold through the planned purchase and sale of state-owned commerce and the production and sales contract system, and even some scattered small commodities are not allowed to be exchanged in the market. Doing so will cause stagnation in the exchange of certain commodities, thereby affecting production and purchase. The other deviation is to one-sidedly exaggerate the role of market trade. In the entire commodity exchange, it is not placed in a supplementary position to planned purchase and sale, but in a parallel position. Many important materials that should have been sold to the state have also entered market trade. Doing so will hinder the completion of the state's purchase plan for important materials and cause some undue confusion in the market. Both of these deviations should be corrected.

Determining the scope of commodities participating in market trade must be conducive to invigorating the market and promoting production, and also ensure the completion of the state's purchase plan. The commodities that can be traded in the market should mainly be the third category of materials that the state has not stipulated for delivery tasks and are outside the production and sales contract. The first and second categories of materials and the third category of materials that the state stipulates for delivery tasks and has signed contracts must first complete the state's tasks; the remaining part after completing the state's tasks can be taken to the market for trading. As for the sideline products and handicrafts produced by individual commune members, except for some first and second categories of materials that the state also stipulates for delivery tasks for commune members, which must be guaranteed to be completed, they can all be sold in the market.

What price should be used to exchange commodities entering the market? We know that market prices are one of the important tools for regulating the interests of the state, collective, and individual, and are related to national construction and people's livelihood. Therefore, the price management of the market must be correctly grasped from the perspective of promoting the development of diversified operations on the premise of ensuring the stability of market prices, taking into account the interests of the state, collective, and individual. The commodities participating in market exchange are different in kind, and their role in the national economy and people's livelihood is also different. They should also be treated differently in price management.

The first and second categories of materials are materials that are of great importance to the national economy and people's livelihood. Whether it is a commune, production team, or commune member, when selling to the state in accordance with the state-stipulated purchase tasks, the state-stipulated purchase price must be implemented. As for the surplus after completing the state-stipulated delivery tasks, when selling in the market, a slightly higher margin than the state's purchase price may also be allowed for different varieties. This can not only ensure the stability of market prices, but also help encourage the development of production.

A part of the third category of materials is also commodities that are closely related to the national economy and people's livelihood. However, since there are so many varieties and the output of each is not large, it is difficult to guide their production and distribution completely through state planning, as is the case with large and major commodities. In the production and distribution process of these scattered small commodities, it is even more necessary to utilize the role of the law of value. Therefore, the prices of the third category of materials, except for the main commodities that should generally implement the state-stipulated price; or for some varieties, the highest and lowest price limits can be stipulated. For those scattered small commodities, the transaction parties can negotiate prices fairly under the guidance of the market management department.

In order to organize rural market trade better, some measures should also be taken to facilitate the masses of farmers in accordance with the changes and needs of rural economic life after communization. For example, the opening dates of the market should be stipulated in combination with the holidays, festivals, and historical habits of commune members; convenient conditions should be provided as much as possible for farmers' purchase and sale activities; some repair, service, catering, and cultural and entertainment undertakings should be handled according to the production needs and living needs of commune members, such as repairing agricultural tools, hairdressing, reading books, showing movies, etc., so that the economic and cultural life of rural areas can be richer and more active through market activities.

Strengthen Party Leadership and State Management, and Correctly Handle the Relationship between the State, Collective, and Individual

Whether the role of rural market trade can be correctly brought into play depends on strengthening Party leadership and state management. Otherwise, it will bring extremely unfavorable effects to the state's purchase tasks and price policies.

First, it should be seen that although rural market trade is a component of my country's unified socialist market, it is different from the planned commodity exchange organized by the state after all. In this sense, it is still a form of free exchange. Of course, this free exchange of small parts of products must be and can only be a small freedom under the state's large plan, and can only be carried out under the leadership of the state. From this, it can be seen that after the development of rural market trade, it requires us to correctly handle the relationship between it and the state's planned purchase and sale, and give full play to the leading role of state-owned commerce in the market. Make it truly a supplement and assistant to the state's planned purchase and sale, without affecting the state's planned purchase and sale tasks.

Second, the objects participating in rural market trade include units under ownership by the whole people, units under collective ownership, and individual members of people's communes; the commodities taken to the market for exchange include products collectively produced and products individually produced by commune members; at the same time, in the agricultural and sideline products produced by communes, production teams, and even commune members, according to state regulations, some can be traded in the market, while others should not participate in market transactions. Therefore, the relationship between the state, collective, and individual cannot but be reflected in market trade, and requires us to handle it correctly.

Third, at present in my country, the socialist revolution has achieved a decisive victory, and the unified socialist economic foundation has been firmly established. This social condition allows us to better utilize the positive role of rural market trade. However, it should also be seen that the bourgeoisie still exists, there are still a small number of privately owned means of production in rural areas, and private economic activities still exist in rural market markets. The habitual forces operating in the manner of the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie still have a wide range of influence. The contradictions and struggles between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and between the socialist road, and the capitalist road have not completely ended. Therefore, in market trade, the possibility of the growth of capitalist spontaneous forces exists, and the struggle between the two roads will inevitably be reflected.

From this, it can be seen that if it is believed that there are no contradictions and struggles in rural market trade, and management can be relaxed, then it is naturally wrong.

Strengthening the leadership and management of the rural market is to correctly handle the above-mentioned relationships and contradictions in order to better serve the high-speed development of socialist construction. Here, in addition to the management of the scope of commodities and transaction prices, attention must also be paid to many other aspects. For example: strengthening policy propaganda and socialist and communist education to the broad masses of commune members, preventing commune members from abandoning agriculture and engaging in business; strengthening the management of purchasing from other places, prohibiting units from other places from carrying out transaction activities without permission and not in accordance with national policies; for small traders organized by state-owned commerce to participate in market transactions, it is necessary to supervise them to operate within the approved scope of operation, and prohibit them from engaging in long-distance trafficking and reselling, and so on. In short, the purpose of taking these management measures is to guarantee the implementation of the state plan on the one hand, and to promote the invigoration of rural economic life on the other hand, so that rural market trade can truly achieve "lively but not chaotic, managed but not dead," and develop more healthily.

Developing market trade after the realization of communization in rural areas is still a new task. Therefore, it is not only necessary to unify ideological understanding and take correct organizational measures, but also to constantly study problems and summarize experience. At present, it is the peak season for purchase and sale, and we must use this new form of rural market trade to resolutely guarantee the completion of the state's purchase tasks, and actively serve to promote production and invigorate rural economic life.

    论农村集市贸易
    管大同
    农村集市贸易是一种新兴的农村贸易形式
    最近一个时期以来，全国各地在加强国营商业的购销工作、推广产销合同制度和逐级召开物资交流会的同时，有领导、有计划地开展了农村集市贸易。这种农村集市贸易，是我国农村实现了人民公社化和农业生产大发展以后出现的一种新的贸易形式。它是为促进生产的发展、扩大商品流通和为满足农民的生产和消费需要服务的。
    这种贸易形式，具有如下的特点：
    第一、它是在国家集中领导之下，以社会主义的全民所有制和社会主义的集体所有制为主要基础的贸易。农村实现了人民公社化以后，进一步地消灭了非社会主义的经济成分，巩固和发展了社会主义的集体经济。这个变化，大大地改变了我国农村的经济面貌。在这种新形势下出现的农村集市贸易，是我国社会主义统一市场的一个组成部分。
    第二、参加集市市场进行交换的，不是全部商品，而是一部分商品，主要是国家计划购销以外的第三类物资，以及人民公社社员家庭和个人生产的一些副业产品和手工业产品。这类零星商品在整个市场的商品交换中所占的比重不大，但品种却极为繁多。因此，农村集市贸易，是对国家计划市场的补充和助手，是社会主义商业在组织分配某些零星商品方面所采取的一种交换形式。
    第三、这种农村集市，主要是生产者直接出售某些零星产品和购买自己所需要的生活用品的场所。参加集市购销活动的，主要是人民公社、生产队、社员，此外，还有国营商业部门和其他社会主义单位；至于经国营商业组织起来的小商贩，也只能是按照批准的经营范围来参加集市的购销活动。因此，从参加农村集市贸易的成员上也可以看出，这种商品交换已经不再是社会主义经济用来联系资本主义经济或者个体经济的形式，而是作为社会主义经济内部的联系方式了。
    第四、这种贸易形式，发展了长期以来在我国农村经济生活中占有相当重要地位的原有的集市的优点，并且利用这种具有历史习惯传统和为农民群众所熟悉的贸易形式，来为组织社会主义新农村的经济生活服务。同时，我们知道，召开各级和各种形式的物资交流会，是活跃商品流通、加强地区联系的一个好办法。而农村集市市场，实际上正是公社和公社、生产队和生产队、以及社员和社员之间的物资交换形式。
    从各地情况看，这种集市贸易不仅进一步活跃了物资交流，促进了人民公社多种经营的发展；同时，还扩大了国营商业的购销活动，更便于国家对农村经济生活的组织和领导。例如，河北省大名、河间、定县、永年等县开展集市贸易之后，很多集市上市商品达一、两千种，成交金额达数万元，大大地方便了生产队、社员相互之间调剂余缺、互通有无的交换，其中属于社员个人自销的商品也占有相当比重；有些地方的国营商业在集市的收购也逐月增加。集市贸易开展后，对于市场物价的稳定有着积极的作用，如四川省叙永、达县、通江等十二县的统计，一些第三类物资的价格，9月和10月两月份比7月份平均约下降了15％—20％。这一新的贸易形式，在我国当前农村经济生活中已经显示了它的积极作用，而为人民公社、生产队和广大社员所欢迎。
    农村集市贸易对发展国民经济、加强工农联盟的作用
    农村集市贸易的出现，决不是什么偶然的现象，而是客观形势发展的必然产物，也是国家、公社、群众在今后相当长的时间内所需要的。由于工农业生产去年的大跃进和今年的继续跃进，城乡人民的生活水平也有了迅速的提高。生产的发展和需求的增长，必然要求进一步扩大商品交换，活跃城乡交流。党中央在“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”中就指出：“在今后一个必要的历史时期内，人民公社的商品生产，以及国家和公社、公社和公社之间的商品交换，必须有一个很大的发展。”农村集市贸易，正是适应这一形势的要求而开展起来的。
    毫无疑问，在农村实现了人民公社化以后，商品交换的计划性日益加强了。人民公社的商品交换，主要是通过国营商业来进行，产销合同成为主要的形式。今后，仍然必须继续扩大国营商业的购销，推广合同制度，不断地加强商品交换的计划性，更好地实现城乡间和工农业间的经济结合。只有这样，才能够促使有计划的社会主义建设蓬勃发展。
    那末，为什么还必须组织农村集市贸易呢？在这里，必须看到以下几个情况：首先，在人民公社实行自给性生产和商品性生产同时并举的方针之下，基于工农业生产发展和城乡人民生活提高的日益增长的需要，商品性生产部分将会比自给性生产部分有更快的增长。特别是由于人民公社在综合发展农林牧副渔各种生产事业方面显示了它的无比优越性，多种经营有了很大的发展。因此，不仅是商品量增长的快，商品的品种也日益增多了。其次，目前阶段的人民公社，在生产资料所有制方面，生产队一级的所有权是基本的，公社一级的所有权是部分的，而生产小队这一级也有小部分所有权。因此，不仅在国家和公社、公社和公社之间，就是在生产队甚至生产小队之间，也需要进行一些必要的商品的交换和调剂。再次，除了集体经营以外，公社社员还有着自己的家庭小副业。这种家庭小副业生产的商品性部分，也将参加到商品交换的范围中来。
    如上所述，在我国农村，由于人民公社化的实现大大地发展了生产力，由于人民公社在生产上贯彻了工农业并举的方针、农林牧副渔全面发展的方针以及自给性生产和商品性生产并举的方针，商品生产大大发展，商品的数量大、品种多。其中，有大宗的、重要的商品，也有零星的、比较次要的商品；有第一类或者第二类物资，也有第三类物资；有公社和生产队集体经营的商品，也有社员个人经营的商品；有长途运销的商品，也有地产地销的商品。对于这许许多多的商品，是不是都可以通过国营商业的计划购销来实现它们的交换呢？显然，这既不可能，也不必要。国营商业实行有计划购销的，主要应该是那些重要的、比较大宗的商品，至于那些产值很小而种类繁多的零星小商品，就需要通过更多的其他适当形式来交换。农村集市贸易，正是基于这种需要而开展起来的。这一形式，也更有利于挖掘货源，扩大国家对农村产品的收购。
    还须认识，开展农村集市贸易，不仅在经济上是必要的，而且在政治上也有着重要的意义。按照列宁的原则，商品交换是从经济上巩固工农联盟的不可缺少的环节。“如果不在工业和农业之间实行系统的商品交换或产品交换，无产阶级和农民在从资本主义到社会主义的过渡时期就不可能建立正确的关系，就不可能建立十分巩固的经济联盟。”（关于新经济政策问题，俄共（布）第十次全国代表会议决议）因此，在扩大国营商业计划购销的同时开展农村集市贸易，来更好地满足农民对商品购销的要求，这是商业工作贯彻党的“两条腿走路”的方针所需要的。它对于活跃农村经济生活，促进生产的发展，进一步从经济上巩固工人阶级和农民的联盟，都有着重要的意义。
    农村集市贸易交换的商品范围和价格政策
    为了更好地指导农村集市贸易的开展，中共中央和国务院在今年9月23日发布了“关于组织农村集市贸易的指示”，对于集市贸易的商品范围和价格等主要问题都作了明确的规定。显然，只有正确地贯彻执行这一指示，才有利于集市贸易的健康发展。
    商品交易的范围问题，是在组织集市贸易的工作中首先需要正确解决的一个重要问题。这个问题实际上就是在农村的商品流通中，把这种贸易形式摆在一个什么样的地位。在这个问题上，存在着两种偏向：一种是认识不到农村集市贸易在当前农村的商品流通中仍然是一个不可缺少的形式和它对于发展多种经营的作用，强调一切商品都通过国营商业的计划购销和产销合同制，即使是某些零星小商品也不允许在集市上去交换。这样做就会使某些商品的交流出现呆滞现象，从而影响了生产和收购。另外一种偏向是片面地夸大了集市贸易的作用。在整个商品交换中，不是把它摆在计划购销的补充地位，而是摆在一个平行的地位，许多本来应该卖给国家的重要物资，也进入了集市贸易。这样做就会妨碍国家对重要物资收购计划的完成，使市场发生一些不应有的混乱现象。这样两种偏向都是应当纠正的。
    确定参加集市贸易商品的范围，必须是既有利于活跃市场和促进生产，又保证国家收购计划的完成。可以在集市进行交易的商品，主要应该是国家没有规定交售任务的和产销合同以外的第三类物资。第一、二类物资以及国家规定有交售任务和签订了合同的第三类物资，必须首先完成国家的任务；完成国家任务以后的剩余部分，才能拿到集市上进行交易。至于公社社员个人生产的副业产品和手工业产品，除了某些第一类和第二类物资国家也对社员规定了交售任务，必须保证完成外，都可以在集市上出售。
    进入集市的商品，按照什么价格来交换呢？我们知道，市场价格，是调节国家、集体和个人各个方面利益的重要工具之一，关系到国家建设和人民生活。因此，对于集市市场的价格管理，必须是在保证市场物价稳定的前提下，从促进多种经营的发展出发，兼顾到国家、集体和个人三方面的利益，来正确地加以掌握。参加集市市场交换的商品，种类不同，对国计民生的作用也不一样。在价格管理上也应该区别对待。
    第一类物资和第二类物资，都是对国计民生关系重大的物资。无论是公社、生产队或者社员，在按照国家规定的收购任务向国家出售时，必须一律执行国家规定的收购牌价。至于在完成了国家规定的交售任务以后的多余部分，在集市市场出售的时候，也可以分别不同的品种，允许有一个稍稍高于国家收购牌价的幅度。这样，既可以保证市场物价的稳定，又有利于鼓励生产的发展。
    第三类物资也有一部分是与国计民生关系较大的商品，但是，由于它们品种极多，而每一种产量又不大，因而就很难像对待大宗的、主要的商品那样，完全通过国家计划来指导它们的生产和分配。在这些零星细小商品的生产和分配过程中，利用价值规律的作用，就更有必要。因此，第三类物资的价格，除去其中的主要商品一般应该执行国家规定的牌价；或者对有的品种可以规定最高和最低限价以外，对于那些零星细小的商品，则可以在市场管理部门的指导下，由交易双方公平议价。
    为了把农村集市贸易组织得更好，还应该根据公社化以后农村经济生活的变化和需要，采取一些便利农民群众的措施。例如，集市市场开放的日期应该结合公社社员的休假日、节日和历史习惯来规定；对于农民的购销活动应该尽可能提供便利条件；根据社员的生产需要和生活需要，办理一些修理、服务、饮食业和文化娱乐事业，如修理农具、理发、图书阅览、放映电影等等，通过集市活动，使农村的经济生活和文化生活更加丰富和活跃起来。
    加强党的领导和国家管理，正确处理国家、集体和个人的关系
    农村集市贸易的作用是否能得到正确的发挥，关键在于加强党的领导和国家的管理，不然，就会给国家的收购任务和价格政策，带来极为不利的影响。
    第一、应该看到，农村集市贸易虽然是我国社会主义统一市场的组成部分，但是，它与国家所组织的有计划的商品交换毕竟有所不同。从这个意义上说，它仍然是一种自由交换的形式。当然，这种部分小产品的自由交换，必须是也只能是国家大计划之下的小自由，只能是在国家领导之下来进行的。由此可见，农村集市贸易开展起来以后，就要求我们正确地处理它和国家计划购销之间的关系，充分发挥国营商业在市场上的领导作用。使它真正地成为国家计划购销的补充和助手，而不影响国家的计划购销任务。
    第二、参加农村集市贸易的对象，有全民所有制单位，有集体所有制单位，也有人民公社的社员个人；拿到集市进行交换的商品，有集体生产的产品，也有社员个人生产的产品；同时，在公社、生产队乃至社员所生产的农副业产品中，按照国家的规定，有些是可以在集市进行交易的，而有些则是不应该参加集市交易的。因此，国家、集体和个人之间的关系，也就不能不在集市贸易中反映出来，而要求我们加以正确的处理。
    第三、当前在我国，社会主义革命已经取得了决定性的胜利，社会主义的统一经济基础已经巩固地建立起来。这种社会条件，使得我们可以更好地利用农村集市贸易的积极作用。但是，还应该看到，目前资产阶级还存在，农村还有一小部分私人所有的生产资料，在农村集市市场还有着私人的经济活动，按照资产阶级、小资产阶级方式经营的习惯势力仍然有着广泛的影响，无产阶级和资产阶级之间、社会主义道路和资本主义道路之间的矛盾和斗争并没有完全结束，因此，在集市贸易中，资本主义自发势力滋长的可能性就存在，两条道路之间的斗争也就不可避免地会反映出来。
    由此可见，如果认为在农村集市贸易中就不存在着矛盾和斗争了，就可以放松管理了，那自然是错误的。
    加强对农村集市市场的领导和管理，就是要正确地处理上述各个方面的关系和矛盾，来更好地为高速度发展社会主义建设服务。在这里，除了对商品范围和交易价格的管理以外，还必须注意到其他许多方面。例如：加强对广大社员的政策宣传和社会主义、共产主义的教育，防止社员弃农经商；加强对外地采购的管理，禁止外地单位不经许可和不按国家的政策进行交易活动；对于国营商业组织起来参加集市交易的小商贩，要监督他们按照批准的经营范围来经营，禁止他们从事长途贩运和转手买卖，等等。总之，采取这些管理措施的目的，一方面在于保证国家计划的贯彻；另一方面又促进农村经济生活的活跃，使农村集市贸易真正达到“活而不乱，管而不死”，更加健康地开展起来。
    在农村实现了公社化之后开展集市贸易，还是一项新的工作。所以，不仅要统一思想认识和采取正确的组织措施，同时，还需要经常地研究问题，总结经验。目前，正是在购销旺季的时候，我们必须利用农村集市贸易的这一新的形式，坚决保证国家收购任务的完成，并积极地为促进生产和活跃农村经济生活服务。
