    Imperialists Get Out of the Congo! Get Out of Africa!
    Resolution of People from All Walks of Life in the Chinese Capital Supporting the Conference for the People of the Congo and Africa to Strive for National Independence and Oppose Colonialism
    On November 25, 1959, people from all walks of life in the Chinese capital solemnly held a rally, warmly responding to the call of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Council to hold "Congo Day" and "Imperialism Get Out of Africa Day," firmly supporting the just struggle of the Congolese and African people for national independence and against colonialism, and paying the highest brotherly respect to the heroic Congolese and African people.
    Recently, the struggle of the Congolese people against colonial rule and for national independence has been rising day by day. The movement of people in various parts of Africa to strive for and safeguard national independence has been unprecedentedly strengthened and developed. The heroic people of Algeria, Cameroon, Kenya, Uganda, Rhodesia, Nyasaland, and South Africa are launching fierce struggles against colonialism and racial discrimination in various forms. The heroic struggle of the African people is violently shaking the colonialists' rule in Africa, striking at the imperialist conspiracies to enslave and exploit the African people, and making significant contributions to the cause of defending world peace.
    The imperialists will never be reconciled to failure. They are attempting to maintain their criminal colonial rule through brutal suppression and various deceptive means. In particular, US imperialism is stepping up its continuous intrusion into Africa from political, economic, and military aspects, attempting to replace the positions of British, French, Belgian, and other colonialists, and put new colonial yokes on the African people. However, no matter how ferocious and insidious imperialism is, their plans are doomed to failure. The imperialists must get out of the Congo and get out of Africa. The African people must achieve complete liberation.
    The Chinese people have always deeply sympathized with and resolutely supported the just struggle of the Congolese and African people. We will always stand with the Congolese and African people, and jointly strive for the final end of colonial rule and the struggle for lasting world peace. We firmly believe that today, when the power of the world's people far exceeds the power of imperialism, the increasingly awakened and united African people, with the support of the powerful socialist camp and peace-loving people all over the world, will further strengthen unity, persist in struggle, resolutely smash any conspiracy of imperialism, and drive all imperialist forces out of the land of Africa. Final victory will surely belong to the great African people. November 25, 1959, in Beijing

    帝国主义者滚出刚果！滚出非洲！
    中国首都各界人民支持刚果和非洲人民争取民族独立、反对殖民主义大会的决议
    中国首都各界人民于1959年11月25日隆重举行集会，热烈响应亚非人民团结理事会关于举行“刚果日”和“帝国主义滚出非洲日”的号召，坚决支持刚果和非洲人民争取民族独立、反对殖民主义的正义斗争，并向英勇的刚果人民和非洲人民致以崇高的兄弟的敬意。
    最近以来，刚果人民反对殖民统治、争取民族独立的斗争日益高涨。非洲各地人民争取和维护民族独立的运动空前壮大和发展，英勇的阿尔及利亚、喀麦隆、怯尼亚、乌干达、罗得西亚、尼亚萨兰和南非等地人民正在通过各种形式展开反对殖民主义、反对种族歧视的激烈斗争。非洲人民的英勇斗争，正在猛烈地震撼着殖民主义者在非洲的统治，打击了帝国主义奴役和压榨非洲人民的阴谋，对保卫世界和平的事业作出了重大的贡献。
    帝国主义者是决不会甘心失败的，他们正妄图用残酷镇压和各种欺骗的手段来维持其罪恶的殖民主义统治，特别是美帝国主义，正加紧从政治、经济、军事等方面不断侵入非洲，企图代替英国、法国、比利时等殖民主义者的地位，把新的殖民主义的枷锁套在非洲人民的身上。但是，不管帝国主义如何凶恶和阴险，它们的计划是注定要失败的。帝国主义者必须滚出刚果，滚出非洲。非洲人民一定要获得彻底的解放。
    中国人民一贯深切同情和坚决支持刚果和非洲人民的正义斗争，我们将永远与刚果和非洲人民站在一起，为最后结束殖民主义统治和争取世界持久和平而共同奋斗。我们深信，在世界人民的力量大大超过帝国主义势力的今天，日益觉醒和团结的非洲人民，在强大的社会主义阵营及全世界爱好和平的人民的支持下，将进一步加强团结，坚持斗争，坚决粉碎帝国主义的任何阴谋，把一切帝国主义势力从非洲土地上赶出去。最后胜利一定属于伟大的非洲人民。　1959年11月25日于北京
