    Always Be Vigilant Against Class Enemies
    —Introducing the Romanian Novel "The Seagull"
    Gao Junqian
    The Romanian writer Petru Dumitriu's novel "The Seagull" is an excellent work. The novel's material comes from a tragic story the author heard among fishermen on the Black Sea coast. Before the liberation of Romania, the fishermen here lived a dark life. They had no fishing boats or fishing gear; all the means of production were in the hands of the boat owners. To survive, they were employed by the boat owners and often risked their lives to go out to sea to fish. Once, a storm arose at sea, and a small boat capsized. Of the three fishermen on board, two unfortunately drowned, and only one escaped with his life after going through untold hardships. The boat owner's son, wanting to seize the fisherman's fiancée, bribed the police authorities to frame him for murdering the other two fishermen and sentenced him to prison.
    Dumitriu began his creative conception based on this miscarriage of justice. In the novel, the author did not simply see the fisherman's experience as a personal tragedy but treated it as an event of class oppression. The novel does not end with the boat owner's property being expropriated after liberation, the establishment of the state-owned fishing company, and the protagonist's grievances being redressed. Instead, it uses these as a starting point to further reveal the development of class struggle under new circumstances. After being released from prison, the novel's protagonist, Adam Jella, discovers that his fiancée, Yuliana, has been forced to marry Simon Danilov, the boat owner's son. Homeless, he drifts to another place and becomes a dockworker. When he reappears before the readers, he is already a skilled Party worker, sent to the state-owned fishing boat October Star as an instructor. Here, he encounters his former enemies again: Simon, Yuliana's husband, is now a worker in the fishing team, and his older brother, Prikop, who once worked as an engine mechanic for a period of time, has actually infiltrated the Party and is a member of the ship's Party branch committee and chairman of the trade union. Adam Jella immediately notices that the ship's production situation is very bad. On the one hand, the fishing workers, who were individual fishermen yesterday, lack a sense of collectivism, do not know how to cherish state property, and do not actively try to improve production. On the other hand, the other branch member of the Party branch, Plediosu, is not vigilant enough. Prikop acts arbitrarily, controls the Party branch, suppresses democracy, attacks non-Party technical cadres, and wins over backward workers, causing the work to fall into chaos. The shortcomings of the fishing workers themselves create opportunities for Prikop to muddy the waters. How to educate and unite the workers and expose Prikop's disguise is a difficult task facing Adam Jella. Through specific events, the author gradually unfolds this serious class struggle in a well-defined manner. Adam Jella and the workers finally expose the enemy and defeat the enemy, while also tempering and educating themselves in this sharp class struggle.
    The author also provides a reasonable and touching description of the other thread of the story, Adam Jella and Yuliana's love affair. When Yuliana hears that Adam has returned, she leaves Simon, but Yuliana being forced to marry Simon leaves a wound on their emotions that is not easily healed. In Yuliana, it is guilt and remorse; in Adam, it is grief and indignation. The author describes in great detail how they care for each other and finally eliminate the emotional barriers.
    The struggle between people in the work unfolds against the backdrop of the struggle between people and nature. The raging waves and the surging sea almost appear in the novel as a force with will and character. With poetic language, the author makes his characters active in the atmosphere of the ocean from beginning to end. Through the struggle between man and the ocean, the author describes the greatness of human power and how human wisdom, courage, and will can conquer blind natural forces.
    "The Seagull," through the description of the events that occurred on the October Star, generally reflects an aspect of the class struggle during Romania's construction period. The author successfully created many characters in the book, and the image of Adam Jella, which he focused on portraying as being firm, unyielding, decisive, and fearless, is unforgettable.
    This novel vividly tells us: During the period of socialist construction, we must always pay attention to and be vigilant against class enemies, and not allow them to infiltrate the revolutionary ranks to sabotage the revolution!

    时刻警惕着阶级敌人
    ——介绍罗马尼亚小说“海燕”
    高骏千
    罗马尼亚作家彼得鲁·杜米特里乌的长篇小说“海燕”，是一部优秀作品。小说的素材，是作者在黑海边渔民中听到的一个悲惨故事。罗马尼亚解放前，这里的渔民过着黑暗的生活，他们没有渔船、渔具，所有的生产工具都掌握在船主手里。他们为了活命，受雇于船主，经常冒着生命危险出海捕鱼。有一次，海上起了暴风，一艘小船翻了，船上三个渔夫，两人不幸淹死，只有一人在九死一生中脱险归来。船主的儿子为了想霸占这个渔夫的未婚妻，买通警察当局，诬陷他谋害了其他两个渔夫，将他判处了徒刑。
    杜米特里乌就依据这桩冤狱开始了他的创作构思。在小说里，作者没有把这个渔夫的遭遇简单地看作是个人的悲剧，而是作为阶级压迫的事件来处理的。小说没有把解放后船主的财产被剥夺，国营捕鱼公司成立和主人公的冤屈得到昭雪，作为故事的结局；而是把这些作为起点，进一步揭示出阶级斗争在新的情势下的发展。小说中的主人公亚当·耶拉出狱以后，发现未婚妻尤莉爱娜已经被迫嫁给了船主的儿子西蒙·达尼洛夫，自己无家可归，便流浪到外地做了码头工人。当他再一次出现在读者面前时，已经是一个老练的党的工作者，被派到国家的渔船十月星号上来当指导员。在这里，他又遇到了以前的仇人，船主达尼洛夫的两个儿子：尤莉爱娜的丈夫西蒙，现在是捕鱼队的工人，他的哥哥普里可勃，当过一个时期轮机工，现在竟然混入党内，是船上党支部委员兼工会主席。亚当·耶拉马上注意到船上生产情况很糟。一方面，昨天还是个体渔民的捕渔工人缺乏集体主义思想，不懂得爱护国家财产，也不积极设法提高生产。另一方面，党支部的另一个支部委员普莱弟奥苏是个警惕性不高的人。普里可勃独断独行，把持着党支部，压制民主，打击非党技术干部，拉拢落后工人，使工作陷于一团混乱。而捕鱼工人本身的缺点，更给普里可勃造成了混水摸鱼的机会。如何教育、团结工人，揭穿普里可勃的伪装，是摆在亚当·耶拉面前的一项困难的任务。作者通过一桩桩具体的事件，使这一场严重的阶级斗争层次分明地逐步展开，亚当·耶拉和工人们一起，最后终于揭露了敌人，战胜了敌人，同时在这场尖锐的阶级斗争中锻炼和教育了自己。
    对于故事的另一条线索，即亚当·耶拉和尤莉爱娜的爱情波折，作者也作了入情入理的描写。尤莉爱娜听说亚当回来了，就离开了西蒙，但是尤莉爱娜被迫嫁给西蒙这件事，在两人情感上留下了创伤，这不是容易治愈的。在尤莉爱娜，是内疚、悔恨；在亚当，是悲愤。他们如何相互体贴，最后消除了感情上的隔阂，作者作了很细致的描写。
    作品中人与人之间的斗争，是在人与自然的斗争的背景上展开的。惊涛骇浪，汹涌澎湃的大海，在小说中几乎是作为一个有意志有性格的力量出现的。作者以富有诗意的笔调，使他的人物自始至终都活跃在海洋的气氛里。通过人与海洋的搏斗，作者描写了人的力量的伟大，人的智慧、勇敢和意志，是能够征服盲目的自然力量的。
    “海燕”通过对十月星号上发生的事件的描写，概括地反映了罗马尼亚建设时期阶级斗争的一个方面。作者在书里成功地创造了不少人物，他所着力刻划的亚当·耶拉的刚毅不屈、果敢无畏的形象，是使人难忘的。
    这部小说鲜明而形象地告诉我们：在社会主义建设时期，要时刻注意和警惕着阶级敌人，不许他们混进革命队伍里来破坏革命！
