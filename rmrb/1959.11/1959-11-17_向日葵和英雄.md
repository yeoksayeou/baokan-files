    Sunflowers and Heroes
    Zhang Futian, Xintai, Shandong
    Sunflowers grow tall and sturdy, with seed heads as large as the moon, and seeds that are sweet and fragrant. Why is that?
    Look, the sunflower's head, its eyes, are fixed on the sun from morning till night. The sun gives it warmth, gives it strength, gives it life.
    People are the same. Some people are despicable, insignificant, boring, selfish, arrogant, disrespectful to leadership, look down on others, and even look down on the Party and the collective. Of course, they cannot blossom, let alone bear fruit.
    However, some people are fragrant for miles, bear abundant fruit, and are loved by thousands and admired by all. Liu Hulan, Dong Cunrui, Xiang Xiuli, Huang Baomei, Xu Xuehui, Liu Yajun... countless outstanding figures, endless tales of heroes.
    And why is that?
    Look, which of the heroes does not have a heart devoted to the Party!

    向日葵和英雄
    山东新泰　张复天
    向日葵长得又高又魁梧，果盘大如月亮，果实又甜又香，那是为什么呢？
    你看，那向日葵的头，那眼睛，从早上到晚上无不注视着太阳。太阳给了它温暖，给了它力量，给了它生命。
    人也是一样。有的人卑鄙，渺小，无聊，自私自利，自高自大，目无领导，看不起别人，甚至看不起党和集体。他们当然开不出花，更结不出果。
    然而，有的人却花香十里，硕果累累，受千人爱戴，万人景仰。刘胡兰、董存瑞、向秀丽、黄宝妹、徐学惠、刘雅君……数不尽的风流，书不完的英雄。
    这又是为什么？
    你看，英雄们那一个不都是一片丹心向着党！
