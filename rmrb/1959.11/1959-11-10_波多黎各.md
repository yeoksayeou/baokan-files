    Puerto Rico became a U.S. colony after the Spanish-American War in 1898. Under the struggle of the Puerto Rican people for independence, the United States was forced to make Puerto Rico a "free associated state" within the U.S. in 1952, granting so-called "autonomy" and promulgating a constitution. However, the United States controls its internal affairs and diplomacy, and the Puerto Rican legislature has no power to pass laws that conflict with U.S. laws. In addition to implementing its own laws, it must also implement U.S. federal laws. At the same time, despite being called a "free associated state," Puerto Rico has no representatives in the U.S. Congress, only a commissioner in Washington. All major policies and measures in Puerto Rico depend on the United States. Therefore, Puerto Rico remains a U.S. colony in every sense of the word.
    For sixty years, the United States has carried out cruel rule and plunder of Puerto Rico, controlling the underground mineral deposits and 80% of the land in Puerto Rico, and seizing half of Puerto Rico's total national income. Puerto Rico mainly produces sugar and tobacco, and food relies on imports, while the sugar industry is controlled by the U.S. Morgan financial group. As a result, Puerto Rico has become one of the largest consumers of U.S. goods per capita, spending $700 million annually on the United States. Puerto Rico's national income is only $470 per capita, less than half the income of the lowest-income state in the United States.
    Puerto Rico has become a U.S. military base. The United States has established 21 naval and air force bases in Puerto Rico, stationed 30,000 U.S. troops, and plans to build an atomic missile base and nuclear weapons depot in Ceiba.
    The approximately three million people of Puerto Rico have never ceased their struggle against U.S. occupation. In January 1954, a demonstration of more than 10,000 people took place in the capital, San Juan. From June to July of the same year, more than 8,000 dockworkers carried out a 35-day strike. In September and October of last year, a large-scale movement for national independence was launched, with the participation of the Communist Party, the Independence Party, and many other groups, demanding that the United States restore Puerto Rico's right to independence.

    波多黎各
    波多黎各是在1898年美西战争后沦为美国殖民地的。在波多黎各人民争取独立的斗争下，美国被迫在1952年使波多黎各成为美国联邦以内的一个“自由联邦”，给予所谓“自治”，并颁布了宪法。但是，美国控制着它的内政和外交，波多黎各的立法机构无权通过与美国法律相抵触的法律，它除了实行本国法律外，还须实行美国联邦的法律。同时，名为“自由联邦”，波多黎各在美国国会中没有代表，只有一个驻华盛顿的专员。波多黎各一切重大政策和措施都取决于美国。因此，波多黎各仍然是不折不扣的美国殖民地。
    六十年来美国对波多黎各进行了残酷统治和掠夺，控制了波多黎各的地下矿藏及80％的土地，攫取了波多黎各全部国民收入的一半。波多黎各主要出产糖和烟草，粮食要靠进口，而糖业又控制在美国摩根财阀手里。因此，波多黎各成为美国商品按人口平均计算的最大消费者之一，每年要对美国支出七亿美元。波多黎各的国民收入，按人口平均计算只有四百七十美元，还不到美国收入最低的州的收入的一半。
    波多黎各已成为美国的军事基地。美国在波多黎各建立了二十一个海军和空军基地，驻有三万美国军队，还要在塞瓦建立原子导弹基地和核武器库。
    波多黎各约三百万人民从未停止过反对美国占领的斗争。1954年1月在首都圣胡安发生过一万多人的示威游行。同年6至7月又有八千多码头工人进行了三十五天的罢工运动。去年9、10月间，更掀起了一个大规模的要求民族独立的运动，有共产党、独立党以及许多团体参加，要求美国恢复波多黎各的独立权利。
