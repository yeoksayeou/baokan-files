Without Dismounting, Whip the Horse Harder: Determined to Conquer the Cultural Barrier, Ningjin Establishes "Three-in-One" Spare-Time Schools

(Our Correspondent Jing Chang) Ningjin County, Hebei Province, the first county to basically eliminate illiteracy among young and middle-aged people, is holding high the red flag of the Party's General Line and vigorously establishing "Three-in-One" political, technical, and cultural schools. Currently, it has established 913 "Three-in-One" elementary spare-time schools, with 90% of all graduates of the county's literacy campaign participating in learning. By the end of the year, 16,000 people will graduate from senior elementary spare-time schools.

During the Great Leap Forward last year, after a magnificent "全民学、万民教" (everyone learns, everyone teaches) literacy campaign, 80% of the county's young and middle-aged people were freed from illiteracy, and the county was awarded a banner by the National Literacy Association. However, after achieving such brilliant success, some students and teachers developed slackening thoughts, such as "graduation from the literacy campaign means everything is fine" and "popularizing elementary spare-time education is a matter for the future." In response to these situations, the County Party Committee promptly put forward the slogan of "without dismounting, whip the horse harder, thoroughly conquer the cultural and scientific barrier," and made multiple arrangements for carrying out farmers' spare-time learning, solved ideological problems through various means, unified understanding, and rapidly pushed farmers' spare-time learning to a new upsurge.

Ningjin County changed the original literacy associations at all levels into Workers' and Peasants' Education Committees, with the secretaries of the Party committees at all levels serving as directors, and absorbed the heads of the Communist Youth League, the Women's Federation, the armed forces, agriculture and forestry, and the Science and Technology Commission to participate. Under the leadership of the committees at all levels, teaching and research institutions were established to specifically study and guide teaching work. The basic production team is the learning group, and the production team leader is also the head of the learning class. One set of organization, two tasks, leading both production and learning. Because the organization tightly links production and learning together, it effectively ensures that production and learning do not interfere with each other. Some people even carry a small schoolbag when they go to the fields and study whenever they have time. The students have turned fields, construction sites, streets, canteens, and homes into learning places, and have created a variety of learning methods. The Baodian Commune adopted the method of "five to the fields" (i.e., teachers, textbooks, blackboards, stationery, and loudspeakers and big-character posters are all brought to the fields), and created six or seven learning methods such as noon classes, night classes, teaching in the fields, guaranteed teaching and learning. The production teams use the gaps during field rest to review their lessons. There are also rotating book boxes for students to read books at any time. The Changguan Commune opened separate classes for mothers of children and set up night childcare stations to help solve the difficulties of bringing children, so that they can study with peace of mind.

In order to solve the problem of teachers for the "Three-in-One" schools, the county vigorously organized in-service training for people's teachers, people's teachers exchanged their own experiences, and primary and secondary school teachers were hired to teach and tutor. In addition, in order to train spare-time junior high school teachers, the county normal school also held two workers' and peasants' education normal classes for the county's people's teachers to conduct short-term off-the-job rotational training. Now, the county's spare-time elementary school teachers have basically reached two people per class, one teaching arithmetic and one teaching language.

In each village's "Three-in-One" school, the Party branch secretary is responsible for the political class, the cadres of the agricultural technology promotion station and the technicians of the commune teach agricultural technology classes. Volunteer teachers teach language and arithmetic. The class schedule is flexibly arranged according to the busy and slack seasons of production.

After graduating from literacy classes and entering the "Three-in-One" schools, the students not only improved their culture, but also enriched their production knowledge and mastered advanced agricultural management technologies. The 50 mu of pear trees in Da Geng Village were infested with pests. After the technical class taught knowledge about eradicating fruit tree pests, most of the fruit trees were cured by the students. Through technical learning, the entire commune has cultivated 1,826 agricultural junior technical personnel. After the Zhaohuliu spare-time school learned the levy policy, the students fought for two days and nights and completed the task of storing cotton and grain ahead of schedule. Through studying the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the students of the production teams of the Baodian Commune were greatly motivated to produce, and the young students of the entire commune organized 103 autumn harvest and autumn planting shock teams and 421 shock groups.

    不下马　猛加鞭　决心攻克文化关
    宁津创办“三合一”业余学校
    本报讯　记者晶昌报道：河北省第一个基本上扫除青壮年文盲的宁津县，高举党的总路线红旗，大办政治、技术、文化“三合一”学校。目前已建立“三合一”初级业余学校九百一十三处，参加学习的占全县扫盲结业学员总数90％。年底将有一万六千人从高小业余学校毕业。
    宁津县在去年大跃进时，经过一个规模壮阔的“全民学、万民教”的扫盲运动后，全县80％的青壮年摆脱了文盲状态，荣获全国扫盲协会一面锦旗。但是，在取得这样辉煌成就之后，有些学员和教师就产生了“扫盲结业，万事大吉”，“普及初级业余教育那是未来的事”等松劲思想。县委针对这些情况及时提出了“不下马，猛加鞭，彻底攻克文化科学关”的口号，对开展农民业余学习进行多次布置，通过各种方式解决了思想问题，统一了认识，迅速使农民业余学习推向了新的高潮。
    宁津县将原来各级扫盲协会改为工农教育委员会，各级党委书记任主任，吸收共青团、妇联、武装、农林、科学技术委员会的负责人参加，并在各级委员会领导下，建立了教学研究机构，具体研究指导教学工作。基层生产小组就是学习小组，生产队长也是学习班长，一套组织，两项任务，既领导生产，又领导学习。由于从组织上使生产与学习紧密拧在一起，这就有效地保证了生产学习两不误。有些人下地也背个小书包，有空就学。学员们把田间、工地、街头、食堂、家庭都变成学习场所，而且创造了多种多样学习方法。保店公社采取五到田（即教师、课本、黑板、文具、广播器与大字报都带到田里）的办法，并创办了午班、夜班，地头教学，包教包学等六、七种学习方式。各生产队利用田间休息空隙温习功课。并有轮流图书箱供学员随时阅读书籍。长官公社为孩子妈妈单独开了学习班，并设立了夜间托儿站，帮助解决带孩子的困难，使她们安心上学。
    为了解决“三合一”学校师资问题，全县大力组织民师进修，民师自己交流经验，并聘请中小学教师上课和辅导。另外为了培养业余初中教师，县立师范学校还举办了两个工农教育师范班，作为全县民师进行短期脱产轮训之用。现全县业余小学教师基本达到了一班二人，一人教算术，一人教语文。
    各村“三合一”学校，都由党支部书记担任政治课，农业技术推广站的干部和社里的技术员讲农业技术课。义务教师担任语文、算术。根据生产的忙闲，灵活安排上课时间。
    扫盲结业的学员进入了“三合一”学校以后，不仅提高了文化，而且丰富了生产知识，掌握了农田管理先进技术。大耿村种五十亩梨树，生了虫害，学校技术课讲了根治果树虫害知识后，果树大部被学员治好。通过技术学习，全社培养出了一千八百二十六名农业初级技术人材。皂户刘业余学校学习了征收政策后，学员们鏖战两昼夜提前完成了棉粮入库任务。保店公社生产队的学员们，通过学习八中全会的决议，学员生产干劲倍增，全社青年学员组织了一百零三个秋收秋种突击队，四百二十一个突击小组。
