    Underground Iron Sea Leads for Ten Years
    Introducing the Advanced Deeds of the Ma Wanshui Group of the Pangjiabao Iron Mine, Longyan Iron and Steel Company
    The Ma Wanshui group of the Pangjiabao Iron Mine of Longyan Iron and Steel Company in Hebei Province has always been the national champion of tunneling in ferrous metal mines. Since its establishment in December 1949, the Ma Wanshui group has been completing and exceeding the state plan ahead of schedule every month, creating the highest national tunneling record for ferrous metal mines nine times. As early as June 1950, they set the national record with a single-heading advance of 23 meters per month. Later, they continued to refresh the records they had created. At present, the tunneling efficiency of the Ma Wanshui group is 180 times higher than in 1949, and the footage advanced by each shift (four small shifts in the whole group) in one day is more than the whole group advanced in one month at that time. Over the past ten years, the group has trained a large number of construction talents for the country. None of the old workers before 1951 remain among the current eighty workers; all have been promoted to leading cadres. Ma Wanshui himself was promoted to Deputy Director of the Mining Department of the Pangjiabao Mine of Longyan Iron and Steel Company in October 1952 and is now the Director of the Mine's Capital Construction Department. According to incomplete statistics, over the past ten years, the Ma Wanshui group has sent out 73 workers to serve as cadres at the workshop and work area levels; at the same time, it has trained 160 technicians to supplement and strengthen itself.
    The glorious journey of the Ma Wanshui group over the past ten years has been a process of constantly fighting difficulties and constantly innovating technology. Tunneling is dealing with rocks, but rocks are ever-changing, some harder than steel, and some weathered into quicksand. Therefore, they don’t know how much blood and sweat they spent and how much brainpower they used to create each new record and each advanced experience.
    Technological Innovation Makes Stubborn Rocks Bow Their Heads
    In August 1954, the Ma Wanshui group was transferred from the production department to the capital construction department to undertake the glorious task of excavating the first large adit of the Pangjiabao Mine. But they were stumped on the very first day. Tunneling is difficult at the entrance of a drift anyway, and what they encountered was weathered rock, collapsing as they advanced. The leadership required ten meters of tunneling in ten days, but after three days of work, they hadn't even reached two meters, and it looked like the task would not be completed. Gao Changpo, the group leader at the time, repeatedly convened core group meetings to mobilize everyone to come up with ideas to overcome the difficulties. Peng Shaowu, the shift leader, suggested first chiseling a pillar-shaped shallow groove and then driving the pillar in forcefully. After many tests, and by changing from swinging a large hammer to hoisting and ramming a wooden pillar, they finally rammed the pillars into the rock one by one, preventing the collapse and greatly speeding up the advance. Later, everyone gave this method a name, calling it the "Tao Liang Leg-Digging Dense Shed Opening Method," which is effective for opening drifts in weathered rock.
    Entering the Great Leap Forward of 1958, the Ma Wanshui group increased the monthly footage of single-heading tunneling to 260 meters and 429.7 meters in June and September. During these two months, they encountered hard quartzite. Not only were the blast holes difficult to drill, but more holes had to be drilled. To improve tunneling efficiency and ensure the specifications of the roadway, it was necessary to first break through the bottleneck of drilling holes. After repeated research, worker Zheng Ming came up with an idea - increase the number of rock drills. In June, when they were excavating a roadway with a cross-section of 14 square meters, they increased the number of rock drills from six to eight or nine, reaching the so-called limit in books - each rock drill should occupy 1.5 to 2 square meters of cross-sectional area. In September, they planned to tunnel 400 meters, and nine drills certainly could not meet the requirements. Guo Jincai, the group leader at the time, proposed lengthening the drill bits of some of the rock drills and alternating long and short drill bits to drill holes. As a result, eleven or twelve rock drills were placed in a cross-section of 10.6 square meters, with an average of less than one square meter per drill, leaving the so-called limit in books behind. Since then, the ratio of rock drills to cross-sectional area in this group has always been about one to one square meter. "Multiple rock drills" and other important technological innovations have increased the group's cycle from eight times a day to twelve times, paving the way for creating the highest record.
    Over the past ten years, the Ma Wanshui group has created more than 200 advanced experiences, large and small. Some specialize in hard rock, some prevent quicksand, some are for drilling holes, some are for loading explosives and transporting materials. Added together, they form a relatively complete set of rapid tunneling experience in mines. As long as they are flexibly applied in light of local conditions, they can subdue this or that kind of rock. In the first half of 1958, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry held an on-site meeting on rapid tunneling at Longyan Iron and Steel Company to promote their experience to the whole country. People from all over the country came to learn constantly. Nearly a hundred enterprises, ranging from Hainan Island to Heilongjiang, including non-ferrous metal mines, coal mines, and railway departments, sent representatives to "obtain the scriptures" here. As for Longyan Iron and Steel Company itself, needless to say, after the company fully promoted the rapid tunneling experience of the Ma Wanshui group, the average tunneling efficiency increased seventeen times from 1951 to 1957.
    Diligence in Study and Hard Training: Versatility
    As the saying goes, high skills make people bold. The Ma Wanshui group has created so many experiences because their skills are high, they can think of them and do them. All eighty workers in the group are versatile.
    Many people are proficient in the five skills of tunneling: drilling, loading slag, blasting, laying tracks, and propping. Group leader Zhang Changzeng can also drive electric trains, repair rock drills, and slag loaders. In July of this year, the leaders transferred all the propping workers of this group to support other groups and teams, and they have not returned until now. However, because many people also know this line of work, the group's production has not been affected.
    There are many new workers in the Ma Wanshui group, and technical education is done well. When new workers come, the old workers immediately sign a master-apprentice contract with them, promising to teach and learn. The main method of teaching is "training troops on the battlefield." Old workers always patiently teach hand-in-hand. Ma Wanshui led new workers to drill holes with a drill rod during the manual operation period. Some new workers made mistakes and hit his hand with a sledgehammer, but he did not say a word, afraid that his pain would affect the new workers' mood and prevent them from learning the technology well. In less important places, they always let new workers operate independently and give guidance from the side. They also consciously arrange for professional workers to do other types of work, so that everyone can master more skills. In addition, they often invite technicians to systematically explain the theory. Everyone has a great enthusiasm for learning technology, often talking about it, and even using chopsticks to gesture the angle of drilling holes in the dining hall. Therefore, new workers in this group can master two or more technologies in three months or half a year.
    Labor Competition: Noble Style
    Competition has become a lifestyle habit for the workers of the Ma Wanshui group. Competition encourages them to constantly boost their energy, strive for the top, and then strive for the top again. For the past ten years, the competition in the group has never been interrupted. No matter where there are advanced records and advanced experiences, they want to catch up and learn. This is how their national record of 429.7 meters per month in September 1958 was produced. At that time, everyone was fighting to create a record of 400 meters per month. Who knew that on September 22, the newspaper published the news that the Zhongliangshan Coal Mine had created a record of 426.8 meters per month. This gave everyone more energy. The workers automatically gathered that day and proposed the battle slogan to catch up with Zhongliangshan. The workers in each shift worked hard and practically, and they really caught up with Zhongliangshan and won back the national tunneling red flag.
    Within the group, the shifts and individuals also competed fiercely. In June of this year, Li Changsheng became the shift leader of a small shift. Because his drill rod technique was not high enough, there were occasional misfires. In July, he was pulled down by several meters by Pang Hongli's shift. Li Changsheng used to be in the same small shift as Pang Hongli and was Pang Hongli's apprentice. He originally wanted to go and see how his master operated, but the water sprayed out by the pneumatic rock drill would block his view, and it was not easy to see clearly from the side, so he came up with a clever method: One day at the end of July, when Pang Hongli's shift came to take over, Li Changsheng did not leave. He picked up a spare rock drill and mixed in with Pang Hongli's shift to drill holes, carefully watching how Pang Hongli led the drill rod and memorizing the arrangement and angle of the blast holes one by one. When it was almost time to blast, he took off his raincoat and hat. Pang Hongli couldn't help but exclaim in surprise, "Why haven't you left yet!" Because they learned advanced experience, Li Changsheng's shift caught up with Pang Hongli's shift in the excavation of the large adit in August.
    In the competition, the Ma Wanshui group not only races against time, but also has a noble communist style. In 1958 alone, they sent people to help other groups and teams twenty times, and they all sent the best technicians to impart experience without reservation. After the Ma Wanshui group completed the plan ahead of schedule in late April of this year, all the workers went to the second mining pit to help with tunneling.
    Politics First: Unity and Friendship
    Strong Party leadership and meticulous ideological education work are the fundamental guarantee for the Ma Wanshui group to go from victory to greater victory, and it is also a distinctive feature of this group.
    Whenever new workers come, the first thing the group grasps is political and ideological education to improve their awareness, and they earnestly admonish them to protect and carry forward the collective honor of the Ma Wanshui group. Even stricter requirements are placed on old workers. Once, worker Zhang Qiming argued with others in the club for a seat. Ma Wanshui, the group leader at the time, severely criticized, "Our group's people take the lead in work, but they can't take the lead in this regard." Under this ideological influence, the workers of the group have generally established a strong sense of responsibility to protect the collective honor, prompting themselves to constantly move forward. Some workers who left the group to study in school also always kept in mind that they must study hard and not lose face for the Ma Wanshui group.
    The comrades in the Ma Wanshui group have strict requirements of each other, but they also show meticulous care and help to each other. In May of this year, worker Shi Xiao often stared blankly while working, and sometimes he didn't come on time even when he went home. Some workers requested a meeting to criticize him. The Party group felt that Shi Xiao usually performed very well, and there must be some reason for it. They sent Party members to Shi Xiao's village several times to find out the situation. It turned out that Shi Xiao's wife was vain and complained that she was given too little money and was making a fuss about getting a divorce, which made Shi Xiao feel uneasy. The Party group also solved this problem properly through various methods. Shi Xiao was very grateful for the Party's care and help, and immediately cheered up, worked harder, and focused his mind very much. Recently, he was named a study model of the group.
    Under the Party's kind care and cultivation, the workers of the Ma Wanshui group have rapidly improved their awareness. There are more than 30 Party and League members in the group, and all of them except for two Party members joined the Party and League after 1956. The new Party members have played an exemplary role in the group and have been praised by the masses. Like Gao Guangcai, who joined the Party last year, he drills holes quickly and well, and has been named a model worker of the group eight times, and has also been named a red flag bearer of Zhangjiakou City.
    At present, the Party organization of Longyan Iron and Steel Company is leading everyone to study and implement the Communiqué and Resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the CPC. The Party's resolution encourages them to continue to leap forward with a hundredfold of heroism. The Ma Wanshui group is working together with more than 2,000 employees of the Capital Construction Department of Pangjiabao Mine to excavate a large underground adit more than 20 miles long. They guarantee to work with everyone to complete the task ahead of schedule, so as to produce more iron ore and let the blast furnace eat its fill.

    地下铁海十年领先
    介绍龙烟钢铁公司庞家堡铁矿马万水小组先进事迹
    河北省龙烟钢铁公司庞家堡铁矿马万水小组，一直是全国黑色金属矿山掘进冠军。马万水小组从1949年12月成立以来，月月提前超额完成国家计划，九次创造了全国黑色金属矿山掘进最高纪录。早在1950年6月，他们就以独头掘进月进二十三米的成绩，首创全国纪录。以后，又不断刷新了自己创造的纪录。目前，马万水小组的掘进效率比1949年提高了一百八十倍，每一个班（全组四个小班）一天掘进的进尺，比那时全组一月的还多。十年来，小组为国家培养了大批建设人才。现在的八十名工人中，1951年以前的老工人一个也没有了，都被提拔为领导干部，马万水自己在1952年10月就升任龙烟钢铁公司庞家堡矿采矿部副主任，现在是矿基本建设处主任。据不完全的统计，十年来马万水小组输送出了七十三名工人担任了车间、工区一级干部；同时又培养了一百六十名技工，补充和壮大了自己。
    马万水小组十年来的光辉路程，就是不断和困难搏斗、不断革新技术的过程。掘进是和岩石打交道，而岩石却是变化多，有的比钢铁还硬，有的又风化成了流沙。因此，他们每创造一个新纪录，每创造一项先进经验，都不知花了多少血汗，费了多少脑汁。
    革新技术　顽石低头
    1954年8月，马万水小组从生产部门调到基本建设处，担起了凿空庞家堡矿第一大平峒的光荣任务。可是头一天就把他们难住了。掘进本来就数开巷口难，而碰到的是风化岩，边掘进边塌落。领导上要求十天掘进十米，闹了三天，连两米也不到，眼看任务会完不成。当时的组长高长坡一再召开核心小组会，动员大家出主意破难关。班长彭少武提出先凿一个支柱形的浅槽，再把支柱硬打进去。经过多次试验，并且把轮大锤打改为吊起木柱撞，终于把支柱一个又一个地硬撞进了岩石，制止了塌落，进尺大大加快了。十天累计十五米，超额完成了任务。后来大家给这个方法起了个名，叫作“陶梁掏腿密集棚子开口法”，凡是在风化岩石打巷口，用它就灵。
    进入大跃进的1958年，马万水小组在6月份、9月份把独头掘进月进尺提高到二百六十米、四百二十九点七米。在这两个月里，碰到的是坚硬的石英岩。炮眼不但难打，而且还必须多打。要提高掘进效率保证巷道规格，就要首先突破打眼这一关。经过反复研究，工人郑明出了个主意——增加风钻。6月份，他们打断面十四平方米的巷道时，就把风钻从六台增加到八、九台，达到了书本上所谓的积限——每一台风钻要占用一点五到二平方米的断面面积。9月份，他们计划掘进四百米，九台钻机当然不能满足要求。当时的组长郭进财又提出把部分风钻的钎头加长，长短钎头合理交叉起来打眼。结果，在十点六平方米的断面里摆开了十一、二台风钻，平均不到一平方米就有一台，把书本上所谓的积限甩在后面了。从那以后，这个组风钻与断面面积的比例，一直都是一比一平方米左右。“多台风钻”和另外的一些重要技术革新，就使得小组的循环从每天八次增加到十二次，为创造最高纪录铺平道路。
    十年来，马万水小组创造的先进经验，大大小小就有二百件以上。有专攻硬岩石的，也有制止流沙的，有打眼的，也有装药、运输的，加起来，便是一套比较完整的矿山快速掘进经验。只要因地制宜灵活运用，就可以降伏这样或者那样的岩石。1958年上半年，冶金工业部就在龙烟钢铁公司召开了快速掘进现场会，向全国推广他们的经验。各地来学习的常年不断。从海南岛一直到黑龙江，包括有色金属矿山、煤矿、铁道等部门在内的近百个企业，都派出了代表来这里“取经”。至于龙烟钢铁公司内部就更不用说了，公司全面推广了马万水小组的快速掘进经验以后，平均掘进工效，从1951年到1957年这七年中，增长了十七倍。
    勤学苦练　一人多艺
    常言说得好：艺高人胆大。马万水小组创造了这么多经验，就是因为他们的本领高，想得出，做得到。全组八十名工人，个个都是一人多艺。
    掘进的打眼、装碴、放炮、铺轨、支柱这五般武艺，不少人是样样精通。组长张长增，还会开电车、修理凿岩机和装碴机。今年7月份，领导上把这个组的支柱工全调去支援别的组、队去了，一直到现在还没有回来。但是，因为许多人也会这一行，组里的生产没有受到影响。
    马万水小组里新工人多，技术教育作得好，新工人来了，老工人马上就和他们签定师徒合同，包教保学。教的方法主要是“战场练兵”。老工人总是手把着手地耐心教。马万水在手工操作时期领钎教新工人打眼。有的新工人走了手，把大锤打在他手上，他一声也不吭，害怕自己叫痛影响新工人的心情，学不好技术。在不太紧要的场所，他们总是放手让新工人独立操作，自己在一旁指点。他们还有意识地安排专业工人干另一工种的活，让大家能够掌握更多的技能。此外，还经常请技术人员系统地讲解理论。大家学习技术的劲头很大，经常谈论，甚至在饭厅里也拿着筷子比划打眼的角度。因此，这个组里的新工人，三个月或半年就可以掌握两种或者更多的技术。
    劳动竞赛　风格高尚
    竞赛，已经成为马万水小组工人的生活习惯。竞赛激励着他们不断鼓干劲，争上游，再争上游。十年来，小组里的竞赛一直没有间断过。不管哪里有先进纪录和先进经验，他们都要赶，都要学。1958年9月份他们月进四百二十九点七米的全国最高纪录就是这样产生的。当时，大家正为创造月进四百米的纪录奋战。谁知到了9月22日，报上刊登了中梁山煤矿创造月进四百二十六点八米的消息。这一下，可给大家加了劲。工人们当天就自动集会提出赶过中梁山的战斗口号，各班工人苦干实干，果真赶过了中梁山，夺回了全国掘进红旗。
    在组内，班与班、个人与个人之间，也赛得热火朝天。今年6月，李长生当了小班的班长，因为领钎的技术还不够高，有时发生呛炮现象，7月份被庞宏利班拉下了好几米。李长生过去和庞宏利在一个小班而且是庞宏利的徒弟。他本要再去看看师傅怎样操作，但是显式凿岩机喷出的水会拦住视线，在一旁不容易看得真，于是他便想出了一个妙法：7月底的一天，庞宏利班来接班了，李长生不走，拿起一台备用风钻，混在庞宏利班里打眼，仔细看庞宏利怎样领钎，把炮眼的排列和角度一一记了下来。到快放炮的时候，他把雨衣雨帽等脱了，庞宏利不禁奇怪得失声叫了起来：“你怎么还没有走！”李长生班因为学习了先进经验，在8月份在大平峒掘进的时候，就赶过了庞宏利班。
    马万水小组在竞赛中不仅是分秒必争，而且有着崇高的共产主义风格，光在1958年，他们就曾二十次派出人员帮助别的组、队，而且都是派最好的技术工人，毫无保留地传授经验。今年4月下旬马万水小组提前完成计划以后，工人们全部出动，到采矿二坑帮助掘进。
  政治先行　团结友爱
    坚强的党的领导，细致的思想教育工作，是马万水小组从胜利走向更大胜利的根本保证，也是这个小组的鲜明特色。
    每逢新工人来了，小组抓的首先是政治思想教育，提高他们的觉悟，并且谆谆告诫要保护、发扬马万水小组的集体荣誉。对于老工人更是要求严格。一次，工人张起明在俱乐部为座位与别人吵了起来，当时的组长马万水严厉地批评说：“我们组的人，干活带头，这方面可不能带头”。在这种思想的熏陶下，小组的工人普遍树立了保护集体荣誉的强烈责任感，促使自己不断前进。有的工人离开小组到学校学习去了，还时时念着要把功课学好，不能给马万水小组丢脸。
    马万水小组同志之间，相互要求是严格的，但相互之间又是无微不至地关怀与帮助。今年5月间，工人施孝干活经常发楞，有时回家了也不按时来。有的工人要求开会批评他。党小组觉得施孝平时表现挺好，其中一定有什么原因。他们几次派出党员到施孝住的村子去了解情况。原来是施孝的老婆爱虚荣，嫌给她的钱少，闹着要离婚，弄得施孝心神不安。党小组又通过多种方法，把这个问题妥善解决了。施孝非常感激党的关怀和帮助，立即振作起来，干劲更足，思想非常集中，最近被评为小组的学习标兵。
    在党的亲切关怀和培养下，马万水小组的工人觉悟迅速提高。小组里有三十多名党团员，其中除了两名党员以外，其他人都是1956年以后入党入团的。新党员在小组里都起到了模范作用，受到群众的赞扬。像去年入党的高广财，打眼又快又好，八次被评为小组标兵，而且被评为张家口市的红旗手。
    目前，龙烟钢铁公司党组织正在领导大家学习和贯彻中共八届八中全会公报和决议。党的决议鼓舞着他们百倍英勇地继续跃进。马万水小组正和庞家堡矿基本建设处二千多名职工一起，在开凿二十多里长的地下大平峒。他们保证和大家一起提前完成任务，以便多出铁矿石，让高炉吃饱吃好。
