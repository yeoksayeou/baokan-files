    The Voice of the Great Class
    Yu Luowen
    I repeatedly read the quotations of the representatives of the Heroes' Assembly, as if standing before a giant. These words seem so simple, yet why are they so moving? Because this is not ordinary language, but the resounding echo of the working class's heartbeat.
    "Words are the voice of the heart," but this must be when the heart and expression are in accord. Whether language has the power to move people depends first on its inherent value. The yardstick for measuring the value of language is, first, the degree to which it reflects the truth. The language of our revolutionary teachers, the classic Marxist-Leninist writers, has a sublime and unparalleled value, precisely because it "applies to all corners of the world" and because it reveals eternal truth. Another major yardstick is the action behind the language. The more actions that confirm the language, the higher the value of the language. Sometimes, even very simple words are priceless treasures for humanity.
    The simple language of heroes can touch people's hearts so deeply also because they have already accumulated a great deal of action beforehand, because what they do is more and better than what they say.
    "I belong to the Party!" What a simple and ordinary sentence. However, when we know that the person who said this is an advanced sanitation worker, someone who has always "done whatever the Party tells him to do," and, moreover, that this person is prepared to "do sanitation work for the rest of his life" as long as the Party and the people need it, then we feel that this is no longer an ordinary sentence, but the crystallization of many glorious and splendid actions. These simple four words make people feel the force that strikes the heart, encouraging people to get closer to the Party. In the face of it, those who are estranged from the Party will feel that there is no place for them to stand.
    "Cherish every minute and second in production!" This is another ordinary sentence. However, when we know that the person who said this is precisely someone who is racing against time to accelerate the speed of socialist construction, turning "small time into big time," we can feel that it originally came from the heart of a person who is contributing his heart and soul to the cause of socialism at all times.
    These languages ​​are no longer languages ​​in the general sense, but the great voices of the working class. He stands like a towering giant in front of everyone. He has such a loyal heart: "For the cause of the Party, for the interests of the people, even if it means climbing a mountain of knives or jumping into a pit of fire, I will do it!" He has such a lofty purpose in life: "I am willing to sprinkle all the blood and sweat of my body on every petal of communism." He has such firmness: "We must thoroughly oppose right-leaning ideas, greatly encourage effort, and always strive to be the best!" He has such fearlessness and heroic spirit: "Difficulties as big as mountains can be kicked away with one foot!" He has such wisdom and talent: "Like growing wings, flying higher and higher." He is also so humble and eager to learn: "Whoever I meet is a teacher, wherever I go is a school." He so cherishes and values the power of the collective: "It is not good to be outstanding alone, it is heroic only if everyone is good." He also has such a broad mind and kind heart: "Giving others happiness is the greatest happiness."
    The spiritual outlook of the working class and the great communist style are radiant and unparalleled in the world. Who can not be excited to be a true member of this class, and how can they not pour the great voice of this giant into their own hearts? If anyone is still unable to emit such light and sound from the depths of their heart, they should at least be able to reflect it; if they cannot even reflect it, then it is worth reflecting on themselves.

    伟大阶级的心声
    俞洛文
    我反复读着群英会代表们的语录，仿佛站立在一个巨人的面前。这些话看来是这样的简朴，为什么又能这样使人激动？因为这不是普通的语言，而是工人阶级的心搏的巨音。
    “言为心声”，但这必须是在心表一致的时候。语言有没有感人的力量，首先决定在它本身的价值大小。衡量语言价值的标尺，一是要看它反映真理的程度，我们的革命导师们，马克思列宁主义经典作家们的语言，具有崇高无比的价值，那原因就在于它“放之四海而皆准”，在于它昭示着永久的真理。另一个主要标尺是语言背后的行动。证实语言的行动越多，语言的价值便越高，有时是极简朴的话，对人类却也是无价之宝。
    英雄们的简朴语言，能够这样深切地打动人心，也就在于早为它们储备了极多的行动，因为他们作的，比他们说的更多，更美。
    “我是党的！”这是一句多么简朴而又平凡的话。但是，当我们知道了说这句话的人，是一个先进的清洁工人，是一个从来就“党叫干啥就干啥”的人，而且，只要党和人民需要，这个人已经准备好“一辈子干清洁工作”的时候，便觉得这不再是一句普通的话，而是许多光辉灿烂行动的结晶。简简单单的四个字，使人感到了冲击心房的力量，激励人们更加去靠近党。在它面前，会使那些同党离心离德的人感到无地容身。
    “在生产中珍惜一分一秒！”这又是一句多么普通的话。但是，当我们知道了说这话的人正是一个为了加快社会主义建设速度而在分秒必争，把“小时间化为大时间”的人的时候，我们这才感觉得出，它原来是从一个时时刻刻都在为社会主义事业贡献自己心血的人的心灵中迸发出来的光和声。
    这些语言，都不再是一般意义的语言，而是工人阶级伟大的心声。他像一个顶天立地的巨人一样屹立于一切人的面前。他有这样的赤胆忠心：“为了党的事业，为了人民的利益，哪怕是上刀山、跳火坑，我也干！”他有这样崇高的生活目的：“我愿意为共产主义把全身的血和汗，洒在它的每一个花瓣上。”他有这样的坚定性：“一定要反透右倾，大鼓干劲，永远力争上游！”他有这样的大无畏精神和英雄气概：“山大的困难，一抬脚就能把它踢开！”他有这样的智慧和才能：“像是长了翅膀一样，越飞越高。”他又是这样的虚心好学：“碰到谁，谁就是老师，走到哪，哪就是学校。”他是这样的珍惜和重视集体的力量：“一人出众不算好汉，大家都好，才是英雄。”他还有这样宽广的胸襟和善良的心地：“给别人愉快，就是最大的幸福。”
    工人阶级的精神面貌和伟大的共产主义的风格，光芒万丈，举世无俦。哪一个人，能不为自己能成为这个阶级的真正的一分子而感到兴奋、又怎能不把这个巨人的伟大心声，倾注进自己的心房中去呢？有谁倘还不能从内心深处发出这样的光和声来，起码也应该能够反射得出；倘连反射也不能，就很值得他反躬自省了。
