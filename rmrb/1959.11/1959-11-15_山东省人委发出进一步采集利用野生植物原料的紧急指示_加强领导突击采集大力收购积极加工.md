According to Dazhong Daily, in order to resolutely implement the State Council's instructions on collecting wild plant materials, the Shandong Provincial People's Committee recently issued urgent instructions on further launching a high tide of movement to collect and utilize wild plant materials.

The instructions require: (1) All regions and relevant departments must earnestly strengthen specific leadership over this work, carry out extensive and in-depth publicity through various forms, explain the significance and benefits of this work, and do a good job in organizing it so that it quickly forms a mass collection movement. (2) All localities should, based on their local conditions, attach importance to the overall arrangement of labor. While ensuring that major agricultural tasks are not affected, planned and organized crash efforts should be carried out to fully mobilize and organize all personnel who can participate in this work. (3) In the collection work, the principle of simultaneously promoting collective operation and individual operation should be resolutely implemented, and the income distribution policy should be conscientiously implemented. The distribution method should conform to the principle of benefiting the increase of accumulation of the commune and production team and fully mobilizing the enthusiasm of the masses. (4) Commercial, grain, health, foreign trade and other relevant departments must vigorously organize the purchase of wild resources while doing a good job in the purchase of major agricultural and sideline products. All usable items should be purchased, and convenience to the masses and basically reasonable prices should be ensured. (5) All relevant industrial departments must take a positive attitude towards the processing and utilization of wild plant materials. (6) The province has established a worker-peasant-merchant cooperation office to be specifically responsible for this work, and each prefecture, city, and county can consider establishing offices to strengthen leadership.

In addition, the Provincial People's Committee also instructed the Commercial Department, Grain Department, Health Department, and Foreign Trade Bureau to jointly formulate the main varieties, specifications, and reference prices for the large-scale purchase of wild plant materials and publish them in the newspaper for local reference. These main varieties include fifteen categories and two hundred and ninety-one kinds of small oil materials, wild oil materials, wild starch materials, wild fiber materials, wild tannin materials, Chinese medicinal materials, animal products, native products, miscellaneous goods, plant weaving materials, native sundries, native chemical raw materials, fruits, game, and waste products.
