    Establish Safety Models, Promote Advanced Experience, Improve Safety Systems, Strengthen Specialized Work
    Luzhou Chemical Plant Emphasizes Safety, Production Increases Greatly
    (Our newspaper, Chongqing, 14th) The Luzhou Chemical Plant in Chongqing has adopted a method of combining large-scale mass movements with strengthening specialized safety work, achieving a double leap forward in production and safety. Since August and September of this year, the plant has not only eliminated major accidents, but also greatly reduced general accidents, creating good safety conditions for the entire plant and ensuring the completion of production tasks. The plant's total output value in the third quarter completed 130.9% of the plan, labor productivity completed 131.17% of the plan, and total cost decreased by 3.85%; the total output value in October increased by 20% compared to September, and the annual state plan was completed seventy-two days ahead of schedule.
    The plant's safety production work was relatively poor in the first and second quarters, and safety accidents occurred frequently, affecting the completion of production tasks. The main reasons were that some leading cadres had incorrect views such as "when the task is heavy, accidents are inevitable," "production conditions are poor, safe production is impossible," and "when there are many new workers, accidents are bound to increase." Secondly, some of the safety production systems were somewhat perfunctory and not practical.
    In response to the above situation, the plant's Party committee conducted careful research and believed that safety work is a combination of broad mass character and high scientificity. Only by vigorously promoting mass movements and strengthening specialized safety work can the vast number of employees firmly establish the idea of safe production; only by mobilizing the masses can safety production be guaranteed from all corners. Then, from July 15th, the plant's Party committee led all the employees to launch a vigorous mass safety production inspection movement. Through great airing, great contending, and great debate, the one-sided thinking of some leading cadres on production and safety and right-leaning thoughts such as the inevitability of accidents and the theory of safety conditions were deeply exposed and criticized, and unity of understanding was achieved. At the same time, the masses were widely and deeply mobilized to expose various problems existing in safety production, and a method combining airing and rectification, and combining leadership and the masses, was adopted to quickly and timely solve many specific problems. The remaining problems that could not be solved temporarily were also included in the rectification plan.
    In order to ensure the continuous, consolidated, and improved mass movement of safety production, they immediately launched a "three-level six-good" safety thematic competition. "Three levels" are: workshop, process, and team; the six "goods" are: good political command, good safety production, good safety measures, good system implementation, good publicity and education, and good civilized production. More than 90% of the plant's employees actively participated in this competition. At the same time, they also established seven safety models in the plant who had maintained safe production for more than 3,000 days, and four safety red flag collectives, vigorously publicizing their safety ideas and advanced deeds, and systematically summarized and promoted more than twenty advanced experiences in safe production from four collectives and more than ten individuals. According to the characteristics that new workers are prone to accidents, the plant summarized and promoted the experience of the synthetic DDT process in the first workshop, where the vast majority were new workers. This process, by universally signing master-apprentice contracts, adopting the method of teaching and learning at the same time, using real people and real events to strengthen the education of new workers on safety production knowledge, and strictly implementing safety production systems, has not had any accidents this year. After the plant summarized and promoted this experience, the number of accidents caused by new workers in the third quarter decreased by 60% compared to the second quarter. Through these efforts, the number of accidents in the plant decreased month by month. In October, 96% of the plant's workers did not have accidents, and 375 workers reached the standard of plant-level outstanding workers with high output, high quality, high efficiency, low consumption, and safe production.
    Through the vigorous mass movement, the plant also revised the safety responsibility system at all levels, the process safety operation qualification certificate system, the plant area traffic safety rules, the hazardous materials warehouse management measures, etc., based on production characteristics. At the same time, it strengthened various effective pre-shift and post-shift meetings, mutual reminder system, shift handover system, patrol inspection system, and technical safety system in the process. While implementing the system, it also strengthened accident management work. Once an accident occurred or the system was violated, the causes, thoughts, responsibilities, and prevention measures were investigated in the same shift, and accident site meetings and accident education meetings were held to educate more people with facts, learn lessons, and prevent similar accidents from happening again. In addition, the pre-inspection and pre-repair system and the specialized machine repair work were restored. Each process in the plant has established equipment maintenance personnel, and the main key equipment is assigned to specialized personnel for maintenance to ensure the safe operation of boilers, various high-pressure vessels, lifting equipment, static equipment, etc.

    树立安全标兵　推广先进经验　健全安全制度　加强专职工作
    泸州化工厂重视安全　生产大增
    本报重庆14日电　重庆市泸州化工厂采取大搞群众运动同加强安全专职工作相结合的办法，实现了生产、安全双跃进。今年8、9月份以来，全厂不仅消灭了重大事故，而且一般事故也大大下降，给全厂创造了良好的安全条件，保证了生产任务的完成。这个厂第三季度总产值计划完成了130.9％，劳动生产率计划完成了131.17％，总成本降低了3.85％；10月份总产值比9月又增加20％，并且提前七十二天完成了全年国家计划。
    这个厂的安全生产工作，在一、二季度做得比较差，安全事故常常发生，影响了生产任务的完成。主要原因是，有一些领导干部存在着“任务压得大，难免出事故”、“生产条件差，不能安全生产”、“新工人多，事故必然增多”等不正确的看法；其次是安全生产制度有些流于形式，有些不切合实际。
    厂党委针对以上的情况，进行了认真研究，认为安全工作是广泛群众性与高度科学性相结合的工作。只有大搞群众运动和加强安全专职工作，才能使广大职工巩固地树立起安全生产的思想；只有把职工群众动员起来，才能从各个角落保证做到安全生产。接着从7月15日起，厂党委便领导全厂职工开展了一个声势浩大的群众性的安全生产大检查运动，通过大鸣大放大辩论，深刻地揭发和批判了部分领导干部对生产、安全的片面思想和事故难免论、安全条件论等右倾思想，统一了认识。同时，还广泛深入地发动群众揭发安全生产中存在的各种问题，并采用边鸣放边整改、领导同群众相结合的办法，土洋并举，迅速及时地解决了许多具体问题。其余一时不能解决的问题也列入了整改方案。
    为了保证安全生产的群众运动持续、巩固和提高，他们又马上开展了“三级六好”安全专题竞赛。“三级”是：车间、工序、班组；六好是：政治挂帅好、安全生产好，安全措施好，制度贯彻好，宣传教育好，文明生产好。全厂90％以上的职工积极参加了这个竞赛。同时他们还在全厂树立了保持安全生产三千日以上的安全标兵七人、安全红旗集体四个，大张旗鼓地宣传他们的安全思想和先进事迹，并且比较全面系统地总结推广了四个集体和十多个个人安全生产的先进经验二十多项。根据新工人容易出事故的特点，厂里总结和推广了绝大部分是新工人的一车间合成滴滴涕工序的经验。这个工序由于普遍签定师徒合同，采用边教边学、用真人真事加强对新工人安全生产知识的教育，以及严格执行安全生产制度等办法，今年以来从未发生任何事故。全厂总结推广这一经验以后，三季度新工人出的事故比二季度减少了60％。通过这些工作，全厂出事故的面月月下降，10月份全厂占96％的工人没发生事故，而且有三百七十五名工人达到了高产高质高效率和低耗、安全生产的厂级优秀工人的标准。
    这个厂通过大搞群众运动，还针对生产特点，重新修订了各级安全责任制度、工艺安全操作合格证制度、厂区交通安全规则、危险品库房管理办法等。同时加强了工序各种行之有效的班前班后会、互相提醒制、交接班制、巡回检查制和技术安全制等。在贯彻制度的同时，还加强了事故管理工作。一旦发生了事故或违犯了制度，当班就进行查原因、查思想、查责任、找防止措施，并且召开事故现场会和事故教育会，用事实教育更多的人，吸取教训，防止类似事故的再发生。此外，还恢复了预检预修制度和专机专修工作。全厂各工序设立了设备维护员，主要关键设备作到专人负责维修，保证了锅炉、各种高压容器、起重设备、静电设备等的安全运转。
