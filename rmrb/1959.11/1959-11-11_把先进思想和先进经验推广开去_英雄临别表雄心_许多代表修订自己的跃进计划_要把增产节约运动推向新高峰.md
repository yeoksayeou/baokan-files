Xinhua News Agency, 10th. On the eve of their departure from Beijing, heroes from all walks of life attending the National "Heroes Congress" expressed great ambitions and high aspirations, stating that they would spread the advanced thoughts and experiences from the "Heroes Congress" throughout the country and push the current increase production and practice economy movement to a new peak. The ever-growing enthusiasm of the representatives foreshadows that we will achieve even greater victories in our march towards new and great goals.

The heroes from all over the country are about to leave the capital one after another and return to their work posts. After the closing of the conference, delegations from various regions held group meetings to discuss the rich gains of participating in this conference and formulate specific plans for conveying the spirit of the conference after returning. At the group meetings, the heroes unanimously believed that this conference made them more aware of the bright and splendid prospects of the great motherland and clarified the current tasks. Therefore, the representatives were full of enthusiasm and doubled their confidence. Many people revised their future Leap Forward plans on the spot, determined to lead the masses to make greater contributions to the motherland. Meng Tai, Deputy Director of Anshan Iron and Steel's Iron Smelting Plant and an old hero, stated that after returning to the factory, he would further mobilize the masses to engage in large-scale technical performance competitions, earnestly learn from the experience of Benxi Iron and Steel's Iron Smelting Plant, ensure the overfulfillment of this year's fourth quarter production plan, and win back the red flag of the national large blast furnace. Li Feng'en, a worker-turned-chief technician from Wuhan Iron and Steel's Iron Smelting Plant, has been carefully organizing all the advanced experiences in blast furnace production he collected at this conference for the past few days and has made a detailed index, drawing up a preliminary plan for gradual promotion after returning to the factory. Li Feng'en will also use the time he spends on the train back to Wuhan to further study these experiences so that he can immediately organize promotion after returning. Many representatives from the Shanxi delegation believed that they had "contributed too few treasures and learned a lot of lessons" at this Heroes Congress. Therefore, they each formulated specific new Leap Forward plans, determined to have a big push after returning. Many representatives from the Jiangsu delegation not only set new goals and technical innovation plans in group discussions but also proposed to take "step forward when facing difficulties, yield when receiving honors, learn from experience and help those lagging behind" as the action guideline for advanced producers.

The heroes from all walks of life not only strive to be upstream, advanced and more advanced but also regard helping others as their most noble responsibility, determined to spread advanced seeds throughout the country and turn advanced levels into the production level of the whole society. Li Fuxiang, the benchmark of Shanghai's machinery industry and an enameling worker at Shanghai Boiler Factory, will not only complete five months' worth of work in the next month and a half, guaranteeing to complete the fourth quarter production plan ahead of schedule together with all members of his team, but also help other comrades in the team learn advanced technology and do a good job, so that their team can quickly reach the level of Shanghai's advanced production team. Li Fuxiang also linked up with dozens of machine tool workers from various places who came to participate in the Heroes Congress, agreeing to continue to exchange experiences and learn from each other in future production. Huang Baomei and Ding Gendi, advanced textile female workers from Shanghai, are representatives of two different shifts in the same factory, who made mutual assurances before leaving Beijing that they would not only keep their teams advanced forever but also help the entire production team become an advanced team. Su Guangming, a famous lathe worker from Harbin Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory, has set new goals again. He promised to help the fitter team realize semi-mechanization by the end of this year, strive to fully realize mechanization by the end of next year, and help the comrades around him quickly catch up with his technical level.

During and after the conference, many advanced producers actively sought teachers and friends, learned advanced experiences from each other, and launched opponent competitions among colleagues in the same industry both locally and abroad, determined to further promote the nationwide increase production and practice economy movement. Eighteen representatives from the machinery industry system in Dalian actively sought advice during the conference, taking advantage of every opportunity to visit their counterparts and learning 203 experiences. While learning, they summarized. The representatives called this practice "braiding advanced experiences." Now, they have summarized 28 key experiences from a large amount of experience based on their own production needs, ready to promote them immediately after returning. After learning the advanced experience of "steelmaking without baking the furnace" from Taiyuan No. 3 Iron and Steel Plant at this conference, the representatives from the Shanghai metallurgical industry system immediately sent a telegram to Shanghai. According to a telegram from Shanghai on the eve of the closing of the conference, Shanghai Steel Plants No. 1, No. 3, and No. 5 have all started trials, and the results are very good. More than 100 representatives from Chongqing have formed 32 pairs of counterpart competitions on the train to Beijing. After 14 days of the Heroes Congress, it has now developed into more than 70 pairs. Not only are there specific competition conditions between each counterpart competition, but also, as the representatives became more and more enthusiastic during the conference, the competition conditions were constantly improved. Huang Rongchang, a famous innovation expert and Deputy Director of the Zhongshan Hall Converter Steelmaking Plant of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company, and He Mingda of Chongqing Iron and Steel Plant, Wei Gaohou, a milling worker at Chongqing Chang'an Machine Factory, and Pan Zhonggui, a milling worker at Wangjiang Machine Factory, all sent each other war letters and launched opponent competitions. Wang Shuqin, a telephone operator at Guiyang Post and Telecommunications Bureau, learned from the advanced experience of Gu Yueying, a telephone operator at Wuxi Post and Telecommunications Bureau in the past, creating a new record of 1,081 connections per hour, surpassing her "teacher" Gu Yueying. This time, the "teacher and apprentice" helped each other at the Heroes Congress and launched a new opponent competition. Gu Yueying is determined to catch up with her "student" Wang Shuqin again this year. After Guan Yingjie, a representative of the Bridge Maintenance Team of the Tieling Engineering Section of the Shenyang Railway Bureau, and Zhou Shaohua, an engineer of the Shanghai Railway Bureau, put forward guarantee conditions to each other to launch an opponent competition, Guo Jiazhi, a representative of the Technical Research Group of the Electromechanical Leading Work Area of the Second Changjiang Bridge, also proposed a challenge competition to the representatives of the railway systems in Shenyang, Shanghai, Jinan, and other places with conditions such as ensuring the realization of mechanization as soon as possible, under their leadership.

Many representatives from the finance and trade systems also expressed their determination to further continue to deeply develop the vigorous mass movement according to the spirit of the conference, do a good job in purchasing and sales, and better serve industrial and agricultural production and people's lives. Wang Yanmin, Director of the Weihe Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Shangzhi County, Heilongjiang Province, a representative of the famous red flag unit in Heilongjiang Province, guaranteed that his unit would further play the role of the commercial sector as a link, serving the gradual realization of agricultural mechanization, water conservancy, chemicalization, and electrification. Zhang Tongzhi, a representative of the Electrical Appliance Store of Harbin Industrial Equipment Company, whose unit has already taken action to better support agriculture during the conference. They have drawn 25% of their personnel to ensure the supply of materials for the five reservoirs under construction in the suburban rural areas, and send agricultural production materials to the countryside, so that the communes and teams can buy them at any time. Zhang Tongzhi guaranteed that he would contribute more to this aspect after returning. Liu Huilan, a representative of Chongqing Shijingpo Trading Store, linked up with Yao Yiqiang, a representative of Chongqing Nan'an Longmenhao Store, for competition, guaranteeing to further improve business management and better organize people's economic life.

The representatives of ethnic minorities from all over the country also expressed their determination to continue to leap forward after the closing of the conference. Jin Shan, a Mongolian fitter from Baotou Automobile Repair Plant in Inner Mongolia, has drawn many machine drawings in his notebook through several days of learning, determined to use the learned experience in his own production. The Tibetan representatives attending the conference stated that they would bring the advanced experience of all ethnic groups in the mainland back to the plateau, and resolutely act as flag bearers in building a new Tibet. Qingze, a Tibetan escort from the Tibet Post and Telecommunications Administration, has been painstakingly researching for several days and has designed many patterns for reforming postal vehicles, ready to conduct experiments after returning. The thirteen representatives from the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture in Jilin Province published a wall newspaper at their residence after the closing of the conference with the title "Greatest Encouragement, Firm Determination." Li Hutian, a famous Korean model rural postman, stated in his letter of determination that he was determined to hold high the red flag of the general line more highly, add heat on top of heat, add strength on top of strength, and implement the spirit of the conference in his future work, so that it will quickly blossom and bear fruit.
