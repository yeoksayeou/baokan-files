    The commune's crops are good,
    Male and female commune members clap their hands and laugh;
    The sorghum laughs until its face turns red,
    The corn laughs until it bursts out of its husk;
    The cotton laughs like clouds falling to the ground,
    The millet laughs so hard it bends over at the waist;
    The five grains are abundant, and the grain forms mountains,
    Commune members vie to praise how good the commune is.
              (Liu Xia)

    公社庄稼好
    今年庄稼长得好，
    男女社员拍手笑；
    笑的高粱红了脸，
    笑的玉米破了包；
    笑的棉花云落地，
    笑的谷子弯着腰；
    五谷丰登粮成山，
    社员争夸公社好。
              （刘霞）
