Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, November 13th: The Foreign Minister of the German Democratic Republic (GDR), Dr. Lothar Bolz, yesterday made a statement to the German News Agency (ADN) regarding the West German Federal Parliament's debate on foreign policy, saying that the Bonn government intends to continue trying to hinder the easing of international tension and still wants to play the role of the main opponent of world peace. It is also trying to postpone the convening of a summit meeting and attempting to remove the issues of concluding a peace treaty with Germany and the West Berlin issue from the agenda.

   Bolz said that, in contrast to the West German government, the GDR welcomes the Soviet-American summit meeting and its results, which are in line with the demands of the people of all countries to ease international tension.

   Bolz said that the West German government verbally supports comprehensive disarmament, but in fact, it is expanding the federal army as quickly as possible. Talking about disarmament is just to buy time to complete West Germany's rearmament in order to achieve aggressive goals.

   Bolz continued, "Due to the current balance of international forces and the development of the German Democratic Republic, there is ample reason to believe that West Germany's provocative activities will inevitably be defeated. West Germany's increasingly blatant revanchist spirit is now facing increasingly strong opposition from the forces of peace. Many people in Britain and France now realize that Bonn's policy poses a serious threat and may eventually drag the people of their two countries into war."

   Bolz emphasized that the upcoming summit meeting should not only discuss the issue of comprehensive disarmament, but also the German question with the participation of the two German states. He said that immediate measures must be taken to defend peace and promote rapprochement between the two German states. The measures that should be taken immediately are the Federal Government's abandonment of atomic armament and the signing of a non-aggression treaty between the two German states.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 13th: TASS reports: The "Soviet Naval Gazette" believes that the West German militarist clique's attempt to accelerate the transformation of the Federal Republic of Germany into a powerful militarist state as a response to the Soviet proposal for comprehensive and complete disarmament is an act of "Bonn's sabotage."

   The article states that at the end of October, the government of the Federal Republic of Germany legally abolished the formal ban on West German production of "surface-to-air" and "air-to-air" missiles.

   Now, the Bonn government is again demanding the abolition of existing restrictions on the West German navy, thereby giving the Federal Republic of Germany full freedom in terms of the tonnage of ships to be built.

   The article points out that it is wrong to think that West German militarists are making these demands solely on their own initiative. Comments in Western European newspapers do not doubt that the government of the Federal Republic of Germany obtained the support of certain major partners in the Western European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in advance.

   The article says that it is acting out a well-coordinated plan, in the process of which one party makes a "demand" and the other parties make "concessions." The founders of the Western European Union are staging this play to prevent public opinion from seeing the deception in the agreement they concluded with the Federal Republic of Germany at the Paris meeting of Western foreign ministers in October 1954.

   The article concludes that Bonn's new sabotage should be severely condemned.

### 德意志民主共和国外长发表谈话  西德政府仍想阻挠局势缓和  “苏联海军报”揭露西方国家使西德加速军国主义化

    德意志民主共和国外长发表谈话
    西德政府仍想阻挠局势缓和
    “苏联海军报”揭露西方国家使西德加速军国主义化
    新华社柏林13日电　德意志民主共和国外交部长博尔茨博士昨天就西德联邦议院进行外交政策辩论事对德意志通讯社记者发表谈话说，波恩政府虽然打算继续设法阻挠国际紧张局势的缓和，仍然想扮演世界和平主要反对者的角色。它还力图推迟最高级会议的召开，并企图把缔结对德和约问题和西柏林问题从议程上抹掉。
    博尔茨说，和西德政府相反，德意志民主共和国满意地欢迎苏美首脑会谈及其结果，这些结果符合于各国人民缓和国际紧张局势的要求。
    博尔茨说，西德政府口头上支持全面裁军，而事实上却在尽可能迅速地扩大联邦军队，谈论裁军只是为了争取时间来完成西德的重新武装，以达到侵略目的。
    博尔茨接着说，由于目前国际力量的对比和德意志民主共和国的发展，有充分的理由认为，西德的挑衅活动必将遭到失败。西德的日益露骨的复仇主义精神现在遭到和平力量日益强烈的反对。英法两国的许多人，现在已经认识到，波恩的政策形成了严重的威胁，并且可能终于把他们两国的人民卷入战争。
    博尔茨强调指出，即将举行的最高级会议不仅应该讨论全面裁军问题，而且应该在两个德国的参加下讨论德国问题。他说，必须立即采取措施来保卫和平、促进两个德国的接近。应当立即采取的措施是联邦政府放弃原子武装，两个德国之间签订互不侵犯条约。
    新华社13日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科13日讯：“苏联海军报”认为，西德军国主义集团企图使德意志联邦共和国加速变成强大的军国主义国家，以此来回答苏联提出的全面和彻底裁军的建议，这一行径是“波恩的破坏活动”。
    文章写道，10月底，德意志联邦共和国政府已经从法律上取消了对西德生产“地空”导弹和“空空”导弹的形式上的禁令。
    现在，波恩政府又要求废除对西德海军的现有限制，从而使德意志联邦共和国在建造舰只的吨位方面有充分的自由。
    文章指出，认为西德军国主义者提出这些要求仅仅是根据自己的主意，这是错误的。西欧报纸的评论并不怀疑，德意志联邦共和国政府预先得到西欧联盟和北大西洋集团中的某些大伙伴的支持。
    文章说，根据协商好的计划来表演一出戏，在演戏的过程中，一方提出“要求”，而其他各方作出“让步”。西欧联盟创始人演出这出戏，是为了使舆论看不出他们在1954年10月西方外长巴黎会议上同德意志联邦共和国缔结的协定中的骗局。
    文章最后说，波恩的新的破坏活动应该受到严厉的谴责。
