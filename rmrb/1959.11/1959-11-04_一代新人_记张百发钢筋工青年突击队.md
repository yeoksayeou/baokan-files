    A New Generation
    —On the Zhang Baifa Steel Bar Workers' Youth Shock Brigade
    The Zhang Baifa Steel Bar Workers' Youth Shock Brigade, a red banner on the Beijing Capital Construction front, has since its establishment in 1954, fought battles at thirty-three construction sites including the Beijing Film and Print Factory, the Beijing Steam Turbine Factory, the Workers' Stadium, and the Great Hall of the People, participating in nine hundred and fourteen projects, each time achieving high output, high quality, safety, and low cost, comprehensively fulfilling its tasks. In addition to being vigorous in production, the team's political, study, and cultural life is also very active. When the shock brigade was first established, there were only four Communist Youth League members, and now there are ten Party members and sixteen League members; originally 60% of the team members were illiterate, but now there are no illiterates, and most have reached the level of higher primary school or above. At the entertainment evenings, each team member can contribute at least one artistic performance, and the basketball team formed by the team has competed with teams from many agencies and schools in Beijing. All team members are full of vigor and have open minds, truly a new generation in socialist construction. For more than five years, they have maintained the honor of being an advanced collective, and have been selected three times to attend the National Congress of Socialist Construction Youth Activists and the National Advanced Producers Congress, and have recently been elected as representatives to the National "Heroes' Meeting."
    The average age of the Zhang Baifa Youth Shock Brigade is only twenty-four. Most of the members were only eighteen or nineteen years old when the team was formed. Why, in a few years, have they been invincible, conquering every obstacle, and growing so rapidly and healthily? If anyone raises this question to the shock brigade, their answer is: "Listen to the Party, wherever the Party points, we will fight there. This is our main experience in being able to always maintain an advanced collective."
    Tests and Lessons
    In 1954, after Hu Yaolin, a carpenter in Beijing, and several young workers formed a shock brigade, their production efficiency increased rapidly. Zhang Baifa, who had just studied at the League School, although he did not understand more principles at the time, the idea of "loving the Party and loving socialism" was deeply rooted in his heart. "To build socialism, others can form shock brigades, why can't I?" Thinking of this, he eagerly submitted a request to the organization to form a shock brigade. In the spring of that year, when the shock brigade was first established, because there was not much steel bar work, their first task was to excavate earthwork, dig stinking ditches, and do heavy labor in a civil building. This was something that many skilled workers at the time could not understand, and it was also a test for Zhang Baifa's team. At first, they worked happily, constantly exceeding quotas. After a few days, some team members' morale fluctuated. At that time, Zhang Baifa, the captain who was only nineteen years old, went to the Party and League office to find the leaders. The leaders told him: "The Party calls for the establishment of youth shock brigades in order to enable young people to play a shock role in the cause of socialist construction," "Youth shock brigades must stand at the forefront of overcoming difficulties." When he returned to the dormitory, he held a team member meeting to discuss the purpose and significance of forming the team. After ideological struggle, the team members recalled the Party's words, "If you pick and choose when you encounter difficulties and look for a way out, what kind of shock brigade is that?" The next day, they happily dug the stinking mud in the stinking ditch. When they dug deeper, they encountered quicksand, and the collapse was very serious, making it difficult to even stand, and it was even more difficult to throw the soil upwards. The team members were all so tired that their backs ached and blisters formed on their hands. When the team members remembered the Party's education: "The shock brigade must stand at the forefront of overcoming difficulties," they immediately proposed the guarantee that "no matter how many difficulties there are, we must make it submit." After collective research, they came up with a method of digging the soil in layered, segmented trapezoids, and finally conquered the stinking mud ditch.
    This incident gave the team members a profound education. As long as they obey the tasks assigned by the Party from the bottom of their hearts, they will generate a strong will to overcome all difficulties and achieve victory. Because the Party gave them strength, they successfully completed their tasks, whether in the severe cold of minus one or twenty degrees, or in the rare heat of Beijing, and were rated as an advanced collective for two consecutive quarters. These achievements enhanced the confidence of the Zhang Baifa Shock Brigade, but some individual team members developed a sense of pride and complacency. They looked down on other groups, and sometimes they were even arrogant. In the third quarter of that year, the construction company conducted a quarterly evaluation, and some team members even told the selection committee that it didn't matter whether they were evaluated or not, just give them the red flag. However, at the evaluation meeting, everyone disagreed with their being selected as an advanced collective, and opinions poured out like a tide. Some criticized them for "walking sideways," and others thought "they are not worthy of being an example for everyone." As a result of the evaluation, they failed to be selected. They walked out of the venue with their heads drooping and holding their breath. After two consecutive nights of discussions, everyone understood the reasons for their failure from an ideological point of view. Team member Ou Junrong stomped his feet and examined his thoughts, saying: "The Party has repeatedly told us that when we achieve success, we must avoid pride and make persistent efforts, but I was blinded by victory and forgot everything." From then on, a saying was popular within the team: "We are not afraid of heaven, we are not afraid of earth, we are only afraid of not listening to the Party." The idea of resolutely listening to the Party in any situation was firmly rooted in the minds of every team member.
    Marching Towards Multi-Skilled Workers
    In the spring of 1956, the Zhang Baifa Shock Brigade was transferred to the Beijing Film and Print Factory to work. There was a lot of steel bar work in this project, with different specifications and sizes. Binding them with iron wire was slow and wasteful, using much more steel than electric welding. In order to speed up the project and save materials, they suggested to the leaders to use electric welding. However, there were no electric welders at the time. Should they wait for electric welders to be transferred, or should they continue to use iron wire binding? The team members did not choose either of these paths, but stepped forward and actively responded to the Party organization's call at the time for "one specialty with multiple skills," marching towards becoming electric welders. Fortunately, an old technician in the team knew how to weld. The team members collected some scrap iron and learned from the master. The first time they learned, because they had no experience, they forgot to bring masks. As a result, everyone's eyes were burned by the arc light and they couldn't sleep at night because of the pain. But no one retreated in the face of difficulty. After three days of learning, they finally made the welding pliers obey their commands, and the fire they produced was also uniform. After they mastered this technology, they not only greatly accelerated the binding speed, but also saved the country thirty-six tons of steel. This matter, like finding the key to a treasure trove, enlightened them and increased their confidence in learning multiple technologies.
    Not long after, the leaders put forward the slogan "Respect teachers, study hard, strive to be upstream, be proficient in one skill and 겸수, be a versatile hand," which further encouraged their determination to learn multiple technologies. They guaranteed: "As steel bar workers, we will learn everything thoroughly, become versatile hands, and never be idle." From then on, under the support of the Party, the team members of the Zhang Baifa team overcame one technical fortress after another. Up to now, the entire team has learned nineteen technologies such as electric welding, gas welding, pouring concrete, and installing plumbing, with an average of six skills per person. They are not satisfied with these achievements, and are determined to learn all the techniques of building houses and contribute more to socialist construction.
    Communist Style
    "Not for personal honor, nor for the honor of a small collective, but together for the honor of the motherland." The Zhang Baifa team kept in mind the teachings of their superiors whenever they competed with other teams. When they created advanced experiences in the competition, they immediately told their competitors and taught them without reservation.
    Last winter, the story of the Zhang Baifa Shock Brigade helping their competitors to surpass themselves circulated on the construction site of the Workers' Stadium. This was a large-scale on-site competition, and seven construction engineering companies in Beijing selected excellent steel bar workers, carpenters, and concrete workers. At that time, some teams had a championship-ism viewpoint and secretly resolved: "This time, we must show our skills and surpass Zhang Baifa." The day before the competition, the team members of this team met Zhang Baifa and asked him what tools he planned to use to bind steel bars in this competition. Zhang Baifa told them in detail about the four new tools they had successfully created without reservation, and also distributed a copy of these tools to them. As a result of the competition, this team happened to surpass the Zhang Baifa Shock Brigade. Zhang Baifa not only did not feel remorse, but also humbly learned from this team. From then on, the atmosphere of communist cooperation prevailed on the scene, and many teams took their own advanced experiences and actively went to other teams to impart them. Some teams sent workers with higher technical levels to support the teams that were lagging behind to catch up quickly. As a result, the construction period was shortened a lot compared to the original plan.
    Hold High the Red Flag of the General Line
    "Seizing every second" is the concrete action of the Zhang Baifa team to warmly support the Party's general line. Because they deeply understand that to quickly change the poor and backward face of the motherland, we must move forward at high speed, and not let go of a single second. In one minute, the country can produce twenty-five tons of steel and twenty tons of cement. The team members are very familiar with these figures.
    When they first arrived at the construction site of the Great Hall of the People, they accepted an arduous task: to bind 680 tons of foundation steel bars within ten days. Six hundred and eighty tons is equal to the total amount completed by this team in the past year and a half. Some team members lacked confidence in whether they could complete it. When Captain Zhang Baifa learned about this situation, he called everyone together, first discussed the significance of this task to the progress of the entire project, and then discussed the Party's general line for socialist construction once again. After this discussion, everyone was full of confidence, and everyone was eager to give it a good fight. Then, they collectively studied and determined the construction plan, reasonably divided the flow sections, and carried out shock work on a contract basis in three shifts. Although the temperature at the time had dropped to minus fifteen degrees, each team member did not want to wear gloves in order to produce quickly. It was stipulated that the three shifts would take turns to carry out shock work, but no one was willing to leave the scene. The dense steel bars were like magnets, attracting them all. Some were dragged away by the Party committee secretary and manager to rest, but as soon as they turned around, they were all back on the scene working. As a result, the task was completed one day ahead of schedule.
    Recently, the team members studied the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, further developed a highly conscious attitude of being the masters of their own affairs, and carried out various forms of competition, so that the task for the entire month of October was completed in only nine and a half days, and the quality all reached first-class products.

    一代新人
    ——记张百发钢筋工青年突击队
    北京市基本建设战线上的一面红旗——张百发钢筋工青年突击队，从1954年建队以来，转战了北京电影影片洗印厂、北京汽轮机厂、工人体育场、人民大会堂等三十三个工地，参加过九百一十四项工程，每次都做到高产、优质、安全、低成本全面完成任务。除了生产上生龙活虎以外，这个队的政治、学习、文化生活也很活跃。突击队刚成立时只有四个团员，现在已经有十个党员和十六个团员；原来60％的队员是文盲，现在文盲一个都没有了，大部分都达到高小以上的水平。在文娱晚会上每个队员至少能出一项文艺节目，队里组成的篮球队已经和北京市不少机关、学校的球队比赛过。全队队员朝气蓬勃，心胸开朗，真是社会主义建设中的一代新人。五年多来，他们一直保持着先进集体的荣誉，三次被选出席全国社会主义建设青年积极分子和全国先进生产者大会，最近又当选为全国“群英会”代表。
    张百发青年突击队平均年龄不过二十四岁。建队时绝大多数的人都只十八、九岁。为什么在几年的时间里，他们战无不胜，攻无不克，成长得这样迅速、健康？如果谁把这个问题提到突击队面前，他们的回答就是：“听党的话，党指向哪里，我们就战斗在哪里。这就是我们能够永远保持先进集体的主要经验。”
    考验和教训
    1954年，北京市木工胡耀林和几个青年工人组成突击队以后，生产效率提高得很快。刚刚在团校里学习过的张百发，当时虽然不懂得更多的道理，但是“热爱党，热爱社会主义”已经深入他的心里了。“为了建设社会主义，人家能够成立突击队，为什么我不能呢？”想到这里，他迫不及待地向组织上提出了成立突击队的要求。这年春天，突击队刚成立时，因为钢筋活不多，他们接受的第一批任务就是在一处民用建筑中刨土方、挖臭沟、干壮工活，这是当时不少技术工人想不通的事情，同样，对张百发队也是一个考验。开始，他们干得挺欢，不断突破定额。过了几天，有的队员情绪波动了。当时，只有十九岁的队长张百发就到党团办公室去找领导。领导上告诉他：“党号召建立青年突击队，是为了使青年在社会主义建设事业中起突击作用”，“青年突击队要站在克服困难的最前列”。他回到宿舍，就开队员大会，座谈建队的目的和意义。队员们经过思想斗争，把党的话回味过来了，“碰到困难就挑挑拣拣，找退路，这算什么突击队。”第二天，他们就在臭水沟里愉快地挖着臭泥，挖到深处，碰上了流沙，塌方很厉害，连脚都站不住，往上扬土更加困难。队员们个个累得腰酸背痛，手泡也磨起来了，当队员们想起党的教育：“突击队要站在克服困难的最前列”时，立刻提出“困难再多，也要叫它屈服”的保证。经过集体研究，想出了分层、分段梯形的挖土方法，终于把臭泥沟制服了。
    通过这件事情，使队员们受到一次深刻的教育。只要从心里服从党分配的任务，就会产生坚强的意志克服一切困难取得胜利。由于党给了他们力量，使他们无论是在零下一、二十度的严寒里，或者在北京少有的酷暑里，都出色地完成了任务，连续两个季度被评为先进集体。这些成绩，增强了张百发突击队的信心，但也有个别队员从此滋长了骄傲自满的情绪。他们瞧不起别的组，有时甚至盛气凌人。这一年第三季度，建筑公司进行季度评比，有的队员竟向评选委员会说，评不评都一样，把红旗拿来就行了。但是，在评比会上，大伙儿都不同意他们当选为先进集体，意见像潮水一样涌向他们。有的批评他们“横着走道”，有的认为“他们不配做大家的榜样”。评选结果，他们落选了。他们搭拉着脑袋，憋着气走出会场。连续两个晚上的座谈，大家才从思想上想通了落选的原因。队员欧俊荣跺着双脚检查自己的思想说：“党一再告诉我们，在取得成绩的时候，切忌骄傲，要再接再厉，而我被胜利冲昏了脑袋，什么都忘掉了。”从此以后，队内流行着一句话：“天不怕，地不怕，就怕不听党的话。”不论在什么情况下，坚决听党的话，这一思想在每个队员头脑里牢固地扎下了根。
    向多面手进军
    1956年春天，张百发突击队调到北京电影影片洗印厂干活。这项工程钢筋活特别多，规格大小不一，用铁丝绑扎起来又慢又浪费，比电焊要多用许多钢材。为了工程进度快而且节省材料，他们建议领导上用电焊焊接。但是当时没有电焊工，是坐等调来电焊工，还是照旧用铁丝绑呢？突击队的队员们没有选择其中的任何一条路，而是挺起胸脯，积极响应党组织当时提出的“一专多能”的号召，向电焊工进军。恰好，队里的一位老技师会电焊。队员们就搜集了一些废铁头，向老师傅学习。第一次学习，因为没有经验，忘了带面罩。结果，大家的眼睛都被弧光照得黑夜疼的睡不着觉。但是谁也没有畏难而退。学了三天，终于使电焊钳子听使唤了，打出来的火也均匀了。他们掌握了这门技术以后，不但大大加快了绑扎速度，还给国家节约了三十六吨钢材。这件事像找到开宝库的钥匙一样，启发了他们，也提高了他们学习多种技术的信心。
    隔不多久，领导上提出了“尊师苦学争上游，精一兼数多面手”的口号，更加鼓舞了他们学习多种技术的决心。他们保证：“身为钢筋工，样样都学通，学成多面手，永远不窝工。”从这以后，张百发队的队员们，在党的支持下，攻克一个一个的技术堡垒。到现在，全队已经学会了电焊、汽焊、浇灌混凝土、安装水暖等十九种技术，平均每个人都会六种手艺。他们并不满足这些成绩，决心要把盖房子的技术统统学会，在社会主义建设中贡献出更多的力量。
    共产主义风格
    “不是为了个人的荣誉，也不是为了小集体的荣誉，而是共同为了祖国的荣誉。”张百发队每逢和别的队展开竞赛时，都牢牢记着上级对他们的教诲。他们在比赛中，创造出先进经验，立刻告诉竞赛对手，毫无保留地教给大家。
    去年冬天，在工人体育场工地上流传着张百发突击队帮助竞赛对手赶过自己的故事。这是一场规模较大的现场比武，北京市七个建筑工程公司都选拔了优秀的钢筋工、木工和混凝土工人。当时，有的队存在着锦标主义的观点，暗暗下定决心：“这次一定要露一手，把张百发比下去。”比赛开始前一天，这个队的队员遇到张百发，询问他这次比赛准备用什么工具绑扎钢筋。张百发毫无保留地把创造成功的四种新工具详细地告诉他们，并且还把这些工具分送给他们一份。比赛结果，这个队恰巧超过了张百发突击队，张百发不但没有懊悔，还虚心地向这个队学习。从此以后，现场上共产主义协作之风大盛，许多队都带着自己创造的先进经验，主动到别的队去传授。有的队派出技术水平较高的工人，去支援落在后面的队迅速地赶上来。结果，工期比原计划缩短了很多。
    高举总路线红旗
    “分秒必争”，是张百发队热烈拥护党的总路线的具体行动。因为他们深深懂得，要迅速改变祖国贫穷和落后的面貌，就要高速度前进，一秒钟都不能放过。一分钟，全国能生产二十五吨钢，二十吨水泥，队员们对这些数字都了若指掌。
    他们刚到人民大会堂工地时，他们接受了一项艰巨的任务：要在十天内绑扎完六百八十吨基础钢筋。六百八十吨，等于这个队过去一年半完成的总数。有的队员对能不能完成信心不足。队长张百发知道了这个情况，就把大伙召集在一起，先讨论这项任务对整个工程进度的意义，又一次地讨论了党的社会主义建设总路线。经过这一番讨论，个个信心十足，人人磨拳擦掌，决心打一个漂亮仗。接着，他们就集体研究确定了施工方案，合理划分了流水段，分三班包干进行突击。虽然当时的气温已经降到零下十五度，每个队员为了出活快，谁也不愿带手套。规定三班轮流突击，但是谁也舍不得离开现场，密密麻麻的钢筋就像吸铁石似的把他们都吸住了。有的被党委书记和经理拖着去休息，可是一转身，又都在现场上干起活来了。结果提前一天完成了任务。
    最近，这个队的队员们学习了八届八中全会的决议，进一步发挥了高度自觉的主人翁态度，开展各种形式的竞赛，使10月份全月的任务，只用九天半就完成了，质量全部达到一级品。
