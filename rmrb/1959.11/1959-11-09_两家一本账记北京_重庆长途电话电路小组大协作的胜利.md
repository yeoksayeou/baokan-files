    A dragon-like collaboration competition, like a red thread, passed through towering mountains and linked the telephone operators of the Beijing-Chongqing long-distance telephone circuit team closely together. In this collaboration, they became the sensitive ears and eyes of the people of both cities, accurately and quickly transmitting the Party and the state's instructions, construction news, and greetings from relatives and friends.

    The operators of this circuit, on one side in Beijing and the other in Chongqing, were separated by thousands of miles. The two sides had to cooperate closely to connect calls. If one end misplaced the wire by even a fraction of an inch, it could cause significant errors and losses. In April of this year, a new operator, No. 44, Guan Zhenhua, was transferred to Chongqing. Due to her unfamiliarity with the situation and different accent, she could not cooperate well with Beijing at first. The operators in Beijing complained that No. 44 was slow, often causing calls to exceed the time limit (taking more than one hour to connect), which affected the completion of production targets. Some operators even considered it "bad luck" to encounter No. 44 on duty and wanted Chongqing to transfer her away. Just then, a vigorous "dragon-like" collaboration competition was launched across the country's circuits. Should No. 44 be transferred away, or should she be kept and helped to move forward together? The operators in Beijing held a fierce debate. Some said that a novice would affect users' calls and should be transferred away. But more people believed that experienced operators came from being novices. With the development of business, new forces would inevitably increase continuously, and No. 44 should be kept, and every effort should be made to help her become familiar with the business.

    At the same time, thousands of miles away in Chongqing, operator No. 44 was sadly crying. She felt that she had not completed her task by not being able to coordinate smoothly with Beijing. To prevent any losses to the work, she wanted to request a job transfer. However, the next day when she came to work, the tone from Beijing had completely changed. The former "Why haven't you connected it yet?" with its dissatisfaction and reproach had disappeared, replaced by: "No. 44, this call is difficult to connect, would you like to try the next call?" "No. 44, the situation in Beijing is like this..." or: "No. 44, this word should be said like this in Mandarin..." A surge of warmth, like an electric current, spread through the line and throughout her body. Her confidence increased, her operation became more stable, and soon she became a capable operator on this circuit. Once, Beijing hung up seven or eight urgent calls, but the circuit was full and could not be connected. No. 44 took the initiative to contact other, less busy circuits, borrowed them, and used cross-operation to quickly connect the seven or eight urgent calls. When the users began to talk, she heard thanks and praise from Beijing.

    Such changes would not have been possible before the launch of the "dragon-like" collaboration competition. At that time, the operators in the two cities had not yet formed a circuit team. Both sides took outgoing calls as their own production targets, always wanting to connect outgoing calls first, and regarded incoming calls as the other party's business. In order to connect outgoing calls first, they often refused to yield to each other. When disputes arose, they adopted the method of "equivalent exchange," where you connect one of my calls, and I connect one of yours. In May of this year, the national postal and telecommunications departments launched a "dragon-like" collaboration competition. The operators at both ends of the Beijing-Chongqing circuit deeply felt that speeding up the speed of calls meant speeding up the speed of socialist construction, and that close cooperation was the key to improving efficiency. At a telephone conference, they took the initiative to make self-criticisms to each other. Under the leadership of the Party committees of the two cities, they formed a circuit team and decided that no matter whose incoming, outgoing, or transfer calls they were, they were the common task of the team. They also held regular telephone conferences to exchange experiences.

    Since then, the efficiency of the Beijing-Chongqing long-distance telephone has greatly improved. Based on the principle of prioritizing urgent calls, they left the difficulties to themselves and provided convenience to others. When encountering objective difficulties such as "address unknown" or "recipient not available," they still tried every means to connect many calls for users. One day, Chongqing operator No. 63, Shen Dezhen, received a call from a Beijing operator, saying that a user in Beijing wanted to talk to a comrade living in the Chongqing Iron and Steel Company's guesthouse about important issues related to steel production. No. 63 hurriedly connected the call, but the recipient had already moved away, and no one knew where he had moved to. If this call could not be connected at that time, this comrade would have to go to another place. At this time, No. 63 thought that during the war years, there were many brave telephone operators who jumped from one bomb crater to another, or let the current pass through their teeth or bodies, to transmit the battle situation; today, I must also be like those brave predecessors, search all over Chongqing to find the recipient and transmit the news of production and construction! She inquired in detail at various apartments, hotels, and hostels in Chongqing, and finally found this comrade in less than an hour. When the users finished talking, the Beijing operator said with emotion: "No. 63, you are too good!" No. 63 immediately replied: "Carrying out collaboration is my bounden duty!"

    Like No. 63, the operators in Beijing also made their best efforts to overcome difficulties and connect calls from Chongqing. It was late one night in July when Chongqing No. 44 said that a caller wanted to talk to a Comrade Hu in Beijing, but did not know Comrade Hu's address and telephone number. In the past, such calls would not have been accepted. However, Beijing operator No. 161, Fan Chengzhen, heard the caller say that this call was to notify Comrade Hu not to go to Shanghai. If the call could not be made that night, Comrade Hu would leave the next day, not only wasting a trip but also delaying matters in Beijing. She felt that not finding this Comrade Hu would cause losses in work. But where could she find him in such a big city as Beijing? It was like looking for a needle in a haystack! Hearing the caller say that Comrade Hu had made a call and sent a telegram to Chongqing that morning, they used this clue to search through the phone record sheets of that day and found that the long-distance call was made at a post and telecommunications branch office, but the business office had already closed at that time. They then asked the telegram offices in Beijing and Chongqing to assist in finding the telegram record, and finally found out that Comrade Hu lived in the guesthouse of the Ministry of Light Industry. However, there were many guesthouses in the Ministry of Light Industry, so which one was it? No. 161 patiently searched one by one, and finally found Comrade Hu on the eighth call. At this time, there was still one minute before the prescribed time limit (one hour).

    In the collaboration competition, this circuit team had a common language called "two families, one account." This idea enabled them to work together and accomplish many things that seemed impossible. One quiet night, the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company in Beijing and the Chongqing Iron and Steel Company had important conversations. After the call was connected, the caller loudly asked: "Are you the Chongqing Iron and Steel Company?" "Huh?" "I said, where are you?" "What are you saying?" It turned out that both companies were in the remote suburbs. After several switchboard connections, the volume was very low due to the line impact. The users on both sides tore their throats and shouted for a long time, but the other side still could not hear clearly. At this time, Chongqing operator No. 63, Shen Dezhen, and Beijing operator No. 95, Zhao Defang, were as anxious as the users. They realized that whether this call could be connected would directly affect steel production. After the two discussed it, they proactively suggested to the users: "Due to the impact of the line, the volume is now very low. If your call content is not confidential, can we relay it to you?" "Great, great!" the users happily replied. With the consent and monitoring of the comrades who were making and receiving the calls, they worked together, relaying the content of the calls to each other station by station, and finally successfully completed the communication task.

    The brilliant idea of communist collaboration illuminated the work of the Beijing-Chongqing circuit team. The over-limit rate (calls that took more than one hour to connect) of the entire team's long-distance calls dropped from 39.5% in March to 8.27% in July. That is to say, the number of calls they connected within one hour had reached more than 90% of the total number of calls made and received within that time. The telephone utilization rate during busy times has also consistently been at the national advanced level. In the national competition and comparison of 27 trunk circuits from the capital to various provinces and cities, they won the glorious title of "Red Flag Circuit."

    Although separated by thousands of miles and never met, the operators in the two cities have established a deep friendship in cooperation. They understand each other like fellow sisters. Just by hearing the voice, they know who the other person is, what they should learn from each other, and what they should help with. They rarely make mistakes in their work, but if they find even the slightest mistake, they first check themselves. They are often praised by the majority of users, but no matter how much praise they receive, they never forget to write a good news report and send it to the other party. During the National Conference of Heroes, Shen Dezhen, a Chongqing operator and representative of the circuit team attending the conference, and Zhao Defang, the leader of the circuit team and a Beijing operator, met. During the cordial meeting, they had the only "dispute" since the cooperation began: Shen Dezhen held the red flag that the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications had just awarded and sincerely said: "Comrade Zhao Defang, this red flag should be handed over to the leading - the Beijing operators. The honor should go to the Beijing comrades-in-arms who cooperated!" Zhao Defang immediately put the red flag in Shen Dezhen's hands: "No, this red flag should be brought to the Chongqing operator comrades. Without the cooperation and help of the Chongqing comrades, our circuit team would not have achieved this little bit of success today."

    The next day, they learned that their circuit team had won two red flags this time. (Shao Quan)

    两家一本账记北京
    ——重庆长途电话电路小组大协作的胜利
    一条龙协作竞赛，像一根红色的长线，穿过丛山峻岭，把北京——重庆长途电话电路小组的话务员们，紧紧地联结在一起。她们在协作中成为两地人民灵敏的耳目，准确而迅速地传递着党和国家的指示、建设的消息和亲友们的问候。
    这条电路的话务员，一边在北京，一边在重庆，相隔着千山万水，双方必须密切配合操作，才能接通电话；只要有一端把线头错挪了半寸，就会差之毫厘，失之千里，造成不应有的错误和损失。今年4月份，重庆方面调来了一个新手四十四号话务员官振华，由于情况生疏和口音不同，开始的时候不能和北京很好地配合。北京的话务员埋怨四十四号缓慢，常常使电话逾限（超过一小时才接通），影响了生产指标的完成。有的话务员甚至认为上班时碰到四十四号就是“倒霉”，想要求重庆方面把四十四号调走。正在这个时候，全国电路开展了轰轰烈烈的“一条龙”大协作竞赛。究竟要四十四号调走，还是把四十四号留下来帮助她共同前进？北京的话务员开展了一场激烈的辩论。有人说，生手影响用户的通话，应该调走。但更多的人认为，老手是从生手来的，随着业务的发展，新生力量必然要不断增加，应该把四十四号留下来，想尽一切办法帮助她熟悉业务。
    就在同时，千里之外的重庆，四十四号话务员难过得哭了起来。她感到不能顺利地和北京方面配合，就是没有完成任务，为了使工作不受损失，她想要求调动工作。但是，第二天一上班，来自北京的话音完全变了。从前“为什么还不快接过来？”的带有不满和责备的语气消失了，代替它的是：“四十四号，这个电话不好接，你接下一个电话试试好吗？”“四十四号，北京的情况是这样的……”或者是：“四十四号，这个词用普通话应该这样说……”一股温暖，像电流一样，通过线路，传遍了她的全身。她的信心增强了，操作稳健了，不久她就成了这条电路上的干练的话务员。有一次，北京挂了七、八个加急电话，但电路已经占满，无法叫接。四十四号主动和通往别地的较闲的电路联系，借别的电路，用交叉操作，很快把七、八个加急电话接通了。当用户们开始通话的时候，她听到了来自北京的感谢和称赞。
    这样的变化，在开展“一条龙”协作竞赛以前，是不可能的。那时候，两地的话务员还没有组成一个电路小组，双方都以去话为自己的生产指标，总想先接通去话；把来话看作是对方的事。为了先接通去话，常常互不相让，在争执不下的时候，就采取你接通我一个电话，我再接通你一个电话的“等价交换”办法。今年5月份，全国邮电部门开展了“一条龙”大协作竞赛，北京——重庆电路上的两端话务员们深深地感到，加快通话的速度，就是加快社会主义建设的速度，而密切地协作配合，是提高效率的关键。在电话会议上，她们主动地向对方作了自我批评，在两地党委的领导之下，她们组成了一个电路小组，决定不管哪一方的来话、去话或转话，都是小组的共同任务。并且定期开电话会议，交流经验。
    从此以后，北京——重庆长途电话的效率大大提高了，她们根据先急后缓的原则，把困难留给自己，把方便送给别人。在碰到“地址不详”、“受话人不在”等客观困难的时候，她们仍然千方百计，为用户接通了许多电话。一天，重庆六十三号话务员申德贞接到北京话务员的电话，说北京的用户要找一位住在重庆钢铁公司招待所的同志谈有关钢铁生产的重要问题，六十三号急忙接通了电话，但是受话人已经搬走了，搬到哪里去也不知道。当时这个电话如果接不通，这位同志就要到外地去。这时候，六十三号想到，在战争年代里，有许多勇敢的电话员，从一个弹坑跳到另一个弹坑，或是让电流通过自己的牙齿或身体，把战斗的情况传出去；今天，我也要像勇敢的前辈一样，找遍全重庆市也要找到受话人，把生产建设的消息传出去！她向重庆各个公寓、宾馆和旅馆详细打听，终于在不到一小时的时间内，找到了这位同志。当用户通话完毕以后，北京话务员感动地说：“六十三号，你太好了！”六十三号立刻回答：“开展协作，这是我应尽的责任！”
    和六十三号一样，北京的话务员，也尽最大的努力，克服困难，接通来自重庆的电话。那是7月份的一个深夜里，重庆四十四号说，有一个发话人要找北京的一位胡同志讲话，但是不知胡同志的住址和电话。在过去，这类电话是不受理的。但是北京一百六十一号话务员范承珍听发话人说，这次通话是为了通知胡同志不要去上海，如果当夜电话打不通，第二天胡同志就走了，不但白跑一趟，而且耽误了在北京的事情。她感到找不到这位胡同志就会造成工作上的损失。可是，这样大个北京城，到哪里去找呢？真是比海里寻针还要难！听发话人说，当天早上胡同志曾给重庆发过电话和电报，他们就根据这个线索，查遍了当天的电话记录单，发现长途电话是在一个邮电支局营业处打的，但那时营业处已经停止营业；她们又请北京和重庆的电报房协助查找电报根底，终于查出了胡同志住在轻工业部的招待所。可是，轻工业部招待所有很多个，究竟在哪个招待所呢？一百六十一号又耐心地挨个查找，打到第八个电话，终于找到这位胡同志。这时，离规定的逾限时间（一小时）还相差一分钟呢。
    协作竞赛中，这个电路小组之间有了一句共同语言，叫作“两家一本账”。这个思想使他们协同努力，办到了许多看起来是办不到的事情。一个更深人静的夜晚，北京石景山钢铁公司和重庆钢铁公司有重要讲话。电话接通以后，发话人大声地问道：“你是重庆钢铁公司吗？”“啊？”“我说你是哪里呀？”“你说什么呀？”原来，这两个公司都在远郊区，经过几次总机辗转接续，由于线路影响，音量很小，用户双方撕破嗓门喊了很久，对方还是听不清。这时，重庆的六十三号话务员申德贞和北京的九十五号话务员赵德芳和用户同样焦急，她们意识到，这次电话能不能接通，直接影响着钢铁生产。两人商量之后，主动向用户建议：“由于线路影响，现在音量很小，如果您的通话内容不保密，是否可以让我们给您传过去？”“好极了，好极了！”用户高兴地作了回答。在挂发电话同志的同意和监听下，她们共同协作，一站一站地把通话内容传到了对方，终于顺利地完成了通信任务。
    共产主义大协作的光辉思想，照亮了北京——重庆电路小组的工作。全组长途电话的逾限率（超过一小时才接通的电话），从3月份的39.5％下降到7月份的8.27％，就是说，她们一小时内接通的电话，已经达到这个时间内挂发电话总数的90％以上。业务繁忙时的电话利用率，也一直是全国先进水平。在全国二十七条首都至各省市的干线电路群竞赛评比中，她们获得了“红旗电路”的光荣称号。
    虽然是相隔千里，从未见过面，但是两地话务员已经在协作中建立了深厚的友谊。她们像同胞姊妹一样了解对方，一听声音，就知道对方是谁，知道应该向对方学习什么和应该帮助什么。她们在工作中极少出差错，但发现了一点那怕是极微小的差错，都首先要检查自己；她们经常受到广大用户的表扬，但是不管怎样的表扬，她们总忘不了写喜报寄给对方。在全国群英大会期间，电路小组出席群英会的代表、重庆话务员申德贞和电路小组的组长、北京话务员赵德芳会见了。在亲切的会见中，她们发生了协作以后唯一的“争论”：申德贞拿着邮电部刚刚奖给的红旗，诚恳地说：“赵德芳同志，这面红旗，应该交给龙头——北京的话务员同志，荣誉应该归于北京协作的战友！”赵德芳立刻把红旗放在申德贞手中：“不，这面红旗你应该带给重庆的话务员同志们，没有重庆战友的协作和帮助，咱们电路小组就没有今天这一点成就。”
    第二天，她们才知道，这次她们电路小组荣获了两面红旗。　（邵泉）
