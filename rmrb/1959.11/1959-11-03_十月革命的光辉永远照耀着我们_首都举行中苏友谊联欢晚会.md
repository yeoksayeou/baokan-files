    The Glory of the October Revolution Will Forever Illuminate Us
    A Sino-Soviet Friendship Celebration Held in the Capital
    Qian Junrui delivered a speech, expressing heartfelt gratitude to the Soviet people and the Soviet experts who helped in our country's construction, and wishing the Sino-Soviet friendship would be increasingly consolidated.

    Xinhua News Agency, November 2nd. A grand Sino-Soviet friendship celebration was held in the capital tonight to warmly celebrate the 42nd anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution.

    The auditorium of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) was filled with a festive atmosphere tonight. More than 4,000 people attended the celebration, including Antonov, the Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the Soviet Embassy in China, and responsible staff members of the embassy, Soviet experts in Beijing, Soviet students, Soviet guests visiting Beijing, and experts and students from other socialist countries in Beijing. At the celebration, Chinese comrades and comrades from the Soviet Union and other socialist countries sat together and chatted like family members, singing and dancing to celebrate the glory of the October Revolution shining across the globe, to celebrate the brilliant achievements of Soviet communist construction, and to celebrate the fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people as strong as steel and as constant as the sun and moon.

    Qian Junrui, Secretary-General of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, first addressed the celebration, extending warm festive greetings to everyone. He said that the October Revolution, which opened a new era in human history, is not only a great festival for the Soviet people, but also a festival jointly celebrated by the Chinese people and the working people of the world.

    In his speech, Qian Junrui warmly praised and congratulated the Soviet Union on its brilliant achievements in building socialism and communism. He said that the Soviet Union's grand seven-year plan marks the beginning of a new period of comprehensive development of communist social construction. This year, in the first year of implementing the seven-year plan, the Soviet people's national economic construction has shown a vigorous development, over fulfilling the original plan. He particularly pointed out that the Soviet Union recently successfully launched its third cosmic rocket, and the photographs of the far side of the moon taken by the automatic interplanetary station show the highest level of Soviet achievements in science and technology. Qian Junrui said that these achievements made by the Soviet people under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union irrefutably prove to the people of the world the unparalleled superiority and unlimited vitality of socialism, and prove that the socialist system will inevitably win and the capitalist system will inevitably perish.

    When talking about our country's socialist construction, Qian Junrui said: In our country's construction, the Soviet people have given sincere and comprehensive assistance. The great achievements we have made are inseparable from the support and assistance of the Soviet people. Qian Junrui expressed his heartfelt gratitude to the Soviet people and the Soviet experts who helped in our country's construction.

    Qian Junrui finally said: As the people of the world celebrate the 42nd anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, we are infinitely pleased that the great friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people is flourishing, and the unity between China and the Soviet Union is becoming increasingly consolidated. Let the glory of the October Revolution forever illuminate us, let us hold high the red flag of the October Revolution and advance victoriously together.

    Today's friendship celebration was jointly sponsored by the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, the State Council's Bureau of Foreign Experts, the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, and the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League.

    Those who attended the celebration included Shao Lizi and Li Zhuchen, Vice-Presidents of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association; Lai Zuli, Deputy Director of the State Council's Bureau of Foreign Experts; Wu Han, Chen Yuan, and Cao Jinghua, Vice-Presidents of the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association; and Wang Zhaohua, First Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League.

    Also attending the celebration were Zhang Hanfu and Zeng Yongquan, Vice-Ministers of Foreign Affairs, heads of various people's organizations, well-known figures from all walks of life in the capital, and some representatives attending the National Conference of Heroes.

    After the celebration activities began, the various halls upstairs and downstairs of the CPPCC Auditorium turned into palaces of song and dance. Some people appreciated the wonderful songs and dances and Peking Opera performances by the capital's artistic groups, some watched the excellent Soviet film "In the Days of October," and some danced gracefully to the lively music. After one song ended, many people enthusiastically played various interesting games. The joyous friendship celebration continued until late at night.
