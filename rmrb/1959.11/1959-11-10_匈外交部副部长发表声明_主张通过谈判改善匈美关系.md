    Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, November 8th: According to a report in today's Hungarian newspaper "People's Freedom," Hungarian Deputy Foreign Minister Sarka Karoly issued a statement on the issue of Hungarian-U.S. relations.

    The statement pointed out that the current relationship between Hungary and the United States is very abnormal. The United States has formal diplomatic relations with Hungary, and the United States maintains a large embassy in Budapest. However, the U.S. government, its representatives, and its lackeys have taken actions at international conferences that violate diplomatic norms and interfere in the internal affairs of the Hungarian People's Republic and its government. The staff of the U.S. Embassy in Hungary are also conducting activities incompatible with their status.

    The statement said that the Hungarian government has repeatedly pointed out this abnormal situation in past notes to the United States and is now once again reminding the U.S. government to stop these actions. The statement pointed out that the Hungarian government is willing to negotiate on all issues involving Hungarian-U.S. relations, but is unwilling to negotiate on any issues concerning Hungarian internal affairs. If the U.S. government declares its willingness to change the current state of affairs through customary diplomatic channels and is genuinely sincere in wanting to improve bilateral relations through negotiations, then there are no obstacles to the start of negotiations.

    匈外交部副部长发表声明
    主张通过谈判改善匈美关系
    新华社布达佩斯8日电　据匈牙利“人民自由报”今天报道，匈牙利外交部副部长萨尔卡·卡罗利就匈美关系问题发表声明。
    声明指出，当前匈美两国关系是很不正常的。美国与匈牙利有着正式的外交关系，美国在布达佩斯设有人员庞大的公使馆。但美国政府及其代表以及它的仆从们在国际会议上对匈牙利人民共和国和政府采取违背外交惯例的干涉匈牙利人民共和国内政的行动。美国驻匈牙利使馆的工作人员并进行与其身份不相容的活动。
    声明说，匈牙利政府过去给美国的照会中曾多次指出过这种不正常的情况，现在再一次提醒美国政府停止这种行动。声明指出，匈牙利政府愿意就涉及匈美两国关系的一切问题进行谈判，但不愿就任何匈牙利内政的问题进行谈判。如果美国政府声明愿意通过习惯的外交途径来改变现有的状态，确实是诚心想要改善两国关系而进行谈判的话，那么谈判的开始是没有任何障碍的。
