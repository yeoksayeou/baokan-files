Bi-Weekly International Review
(October 16 - 31)

A Sharp Contrast in Economic Development Under Different Systems

	The facts of the past half-month illustrate that the economic construction of the socialist camp countries is continuing to develop with the force of a galloping horse. Soviet Deputy Premier Kosygin pointed out at the recent session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union that this year's growth rate of Soviet industrial production greatly exceeds the average annual target set by the Seven-Year Plan. The production of means of production is expected to increase by 12% compared with last year, and consumer goods will increase by 10.5%. Due to the smooth development in the past two years, the Soviet Seven-Year Plan can be greatly overfulfilled, and the Soviet Union's overtaking of the United States in a relatively short period of time will be further reliably guaranteed. China's socialist construction is also continuing to leap forward. Comrade Zhu De pointed out in his congratulatory message on behalf of the CPC Central Committee at the meeting of heroes: This year, China's national economic plan will be completed ahead of schedule and overfulfilled. Steel production will exceed 12 million tons, and the total agricultural output value will increase by more than 10% compared with last year. The main indicators of China's Second Five-Year Plan can be completed three years ahead of schedule this year. The economic situation in other socialist countries in Asia and Europe is also very good. Recently, successive reports of major advances in capital construction, overfulfillment of industrial production plans, and many enterprises entering the 1960 fiscal year ahead of schedule have been received from these countries. These rapidly changing achievements are shortening the economic distance between socialist countries and the most developed capitalist countries, and foreshadowing that the socialist steed will soon leave the capitalist nag behind.

	The superiority of the socialist system can also be clearly seen from the recent successful photography of the far side of the moon by the Soviet automatic interplanetary station, which shocked the world. This achievement eloquently proves the Soviet Union's leading position in a series of scientific and technological sectors—mathematics, mechanics, physics, radio electronics, and chemistry. The shock it caused in the United States and the entire Western world even exceeded the fact of the launch of the automatic interplanetary station itself. The United States cannot but admit once again that it is "far behind" in the race to conquer outer space. Some well-known American scientists, such as Medaris and Braun, who are responsible for leading work in this area, even want to resign because they see no hope of competing with the Soviet Union. The "pitiable appearance" of these people is a portrayal of the decline and decay of the capitalist system!

	The economic situation in the United States stands in sharp contrast to the booming economic development in the Soviet Union and socialist countries. The US industrial production index for the third quarter of this year fell by 1% compared with the second quarter, and is still at the level of the end of 1956 to the beginning of 1957. The strike of 500,000 American steelworkers for the reasonable demand for increased wages, which has lasted for more than 100 days, has dealt a heavy blow to the US government's plan to expand armaments and prepare for war (including the plan to develop missiles). American newspapers admitted that "the difficulties caused and likely to be caused by the strike are enormous." It is estimated that if the strike continues, the number of workers who stop working due to the impact of the strike will reach 3 million by the end of December (this is not the total number of unemployed, and the United States already has 4 million completely unemployed). And even if work resumes immediately, it will take at least four weeks to gradually restore steel industry production. Due to the impact of the strike, the average daily steel production in the United States, which originally produced more than 100 million tons of steel annually, is now only more than 47,100 tons.

	On the other hand, the financial situation in the United States is constantly deteriorating. The US budget deficit for fiscal year 1959 reached 12.5 billion US dollars, and the national debt reached a new record of 290 billion US dollars. The US international balance of payments deficit this year will also reach 4 billion US dollars. This situation cannot but cause panic among US officials. US Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs Dillon recently exclaimed that "such a large deficit certainly cannot continue" and asked Western countries to relax trade restrictions on the United States. Neil, chairman of the US Economic Development Committee, even said more pitifully: "Just as Europe needed our help during the Renaissance, we now need Europe's help..." The weakening of the US economic position is one of the important reasons for the weakening of its leadership position in the Western camp in the recent period.

The Struggle Between Peace Forces and "Cold War" Forces Continues

	On the entire international stage, two forces continue to struggle. Soviet Premier Khrushchev's visit to the United States and the Soviet proposal for complete and thorough disarmament continue to have a tremendous impact around the world. Together with the Soviet Union, various socialist countries in Asia and Europe have recently made new efforts to ease international tensions, ensure peace in Asia and Europe, and maintain and enhance friendship with newly independent countries in Asia and Africa. All of these have been warmly welcomed and supported by peace-loving people all over the world. Precisely because of this, the imperialist "cold war forces" have suffered a heavy blow, and the temperature of the international situation has warmed up somewhat recently.

	Because peaceful coexistence is what people want and the general trend, the imperialist "policy of strength" has been severely frustrated, and American leaders have also recently made some peaceful remarks and expressed their agreement to resolve international disputes peacefully. But people cannot only look at words, but also at facts.

	In this recent period of time, the United States is still strengthening military blocs, military bases, and military exercises everywhere; stepping up the revival of militarism in West Germany, vigorously promoting the revision of the "Security Treaty" in Japan to revive Japanese militarism, and strengthening the US-Japan military aggression alliance; instigating the Sananikone group in Laos to frantically persecute patriots such as Souphanouvong in order to further expand the civil war in Laos; and manipulating many countries in the United Nations General Assembly to pass a so-called resolution on the "Tibet issue," interfering in China's internal affairs and creating a new "cold war." Precisely at a time when people of all countries universally demanded the easing of tensions, the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee issued a report advocating strengthening the North Atlantic Aggression Group as the "overriding purpose" of US foreign policy, urging North Atlantic countries to accelerate the realization of the preparedness goal of establishing 30 regular divisions and 60 reserve divisions, advocating giving Western European countries nuclear weapons, and demanding that the United States establish a "highly mobile strategic reserve force." It was also at this time that the US military announced that it would send 39 missile squadrons to Western Europe before the end of this year to strengthen US missile bases, and decided to conduct 24 missile tests in the central part of Okinawa Island, which is occupied by the United States. In addition, the US government once again rejected the appeal of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to urge US troops to withdraw from South Korea and strive for the peaceful reunification of Korea.

	All of this clearly shows that the struggle to ease tensions and safeguard world peace is a long-term, tortuous, and repeated struggle.

Lao and Cuban People Oppose US Intervention

	In the past half month, the struggles of the Lao and Cuban people against US imperialism's interference in internal affairs, attempts to expand the civil war in Laos, and subvert the Cuban revolutionary government have also aroused close attention from world public opinion.

	The civil war provoked by the Lao Sananikone government under the instigation of the United States has not only failed to realize its conspiracy to eliminate the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units, but has instead shot itself in the foot, further isolating itself domestically and putting itself in a dilemma. In this situation, the United States recently instructed the Sananikone government to intensify its persecution of Lao Patriotic Front leaders such as Prince Souphanouvong, who have been illegally detained. The Lao authorities recently announced that they would conduct an illegal "trial" of Souphanouvong and others on charges of so-called "conspiracy to betray the country." At the same time, the United States is also conducting activities in the United Nations, conspiring to organize and send a so-called UN Standing Committee to Laos. The purpose of the US-San group is to attack the leading organs of the Lao Patriotic Front and the party's legal status, in order to block all avenues for peaceful resolution of the Lao issue through negotiations and further expand the civil war in Laos.

	However, this sinister conspiracy of US imperialism and the Sananikone group has aroused great anger and resolute opposition from the Lao people. In recent days, organizations of the Lao Patriotic Front and people from all over the country have held meetings and sent telegrams protesting the new persecution of Souphanouvong and others by the US-San group. Phoumi Vongvichit, vice chairman of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front, has sent a telegram to the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference, requesting that emergency measures be taken to immediately stop the Lao authorities' persecution of Souphanouvong. The Lao people's patriotic struggle against US imperialism's interference has also received support from just public opinion in various countries. The Soviet delegation to the UN General Assembly has issued a statement opposing the UN's organization and dispatch of a so-called standing committee to Laos. Chinese Foreign Minister Chen Yi has also sent a letter to the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference, demanding that the Lao government be stopped from illegally trying Souphanouvong, and firmly advocating that the Lao issue be resolved peacefully through negotiations based on the Geneva Accords, in order to ease the tension in Indochina.

	The Cuban people's struggle against US interference in internal affairs and to defend the achievements of the Cuban revolution has also seen a new upsurge recently. On October 26, the Cuban people held a million-strong demonstration in Havana, angrily protesting the US government's threat to Cuban land reform, instigating Cuban counter-revolutionaries to conspire to carry out armed rebellion, and the provocative act of airplanes from the United States attacking the Cuban capital Havana. After firmly suppressing the rebellion conspiracy of Camagüey Province's former armed forces commander Matos, the Cuban revolutionary government has announced the restoration of revolutionary tribunals, and at the same time decided to implement universal military training for patriotic people from all walks of life, including workers, peasants, and others, in order to arm themselves to defend national security. This just struggle of the Cuban people will undoubtedly continue to receive the sympathy and support of the people of Latin American countries and all peace-loving people around the world.

    半月国际述评
    （10月16日——31日）
    不同制度下经济发展的鲜明对比
    最近半个月来的事实说明：社会主义阵营各国的经济建设，正在以万马奔腾之势继续发展中。苏联部长会议副主席柯西金在前几天举行的苏联最高苏维埃会议上指出：今年苏联工业生产的增长速度大大超过七年计划所规定的平均年度任务。生产资料的生产量预计将比去年增加12％，消费资料将增加10.5％。由于这两年来的顺利发展，苏联七年计划可以大大超额完成，苏联在比较短的时间内赶过美国将进一步得到可靠的保证。我国的社会主义建设事业也在继续跃进。朱德同志代表中共中央在群英会上的祝词中指出：今年我国的国民经济计划将提前和超额完成。钢产量将超过一千二百万吨，农业总产值将比去年增长10％以上。我国第二个五年计划的主要指标可以提前三年在今年内完成。亚洲和欧洲其他社会主义国家的经济形势也都非常之好。最近从这些国家接连传来了基本建设大步前进、工业生产计划超额完成和许多企业提前跨进1960年度的捷报。这些日新月异的成就，正在缩短着社会主义国家同最发达的资本主义国家在经济上的距离，预示着社会主义的骏马将会很快地把资本主义的病驽抛在后边。
    从最近轰动世界的苏联自动行星际站拍摄月球背面照片获得成功的事实中，也可以清楚地看到社会主义制度的优越性。这个成就雄辩地证明了苏联在一系列科学技术部门——数学、机械学、物理学、无线电电子学和化学方面的领先地位。它在美国和整个西方世界所引起的震动甚至超过了发射自动行星际站的事实本身。美国不能不再一次承认自己在征服宇宙空间的竞赛中“大大地落后了”。那些在这方面担负领导工作的美国著名科学家如梅德里斯和布劳恩等人，甚至因为同苏联竞争无望而要辞职不干了。这些人的“可怜相”，正是资本主义制度没落和衰败的一种写照！
    美国经济状况同苏联和社会主义国家经济蓬勃发展的状况恰恰成为鲜明的对比。美国今年第三季度的工业生产指数比第二季度下降了1％，现在还停留在1956年底到1957年初的水平上。美国五十万钢铁工人为增加工资的合理要求而坚持了一百多天的罢工，已给美国政府的扩军备战计划（包括发展导弹的计划）以沉重的打击。美国报刊承认，“罢工所引起和可能引起的困难是巨大的”。据估计，如罢工继续坚持下去，因受到罢工的影响而停止工作的工人到12月底将达到三百万人（这还不是全部的失业人数，美国现在已经有四百万完全失业者）。而且即使马上复工，也至少要经过四个星期才能逐步恢复钢铁工业的生产。由于受到罢工的影响，本来每年产钢达一亿吨以上的美国，现在钢的平均日产量只有四万七千一百多吨。
    另一方面，美国的财政状况也在不断恶化。美国1959年度的预算赤字达到一百二十五亿美元，国债更高达二千九百亿美元的新纪录。美国今年国际收支的赤字也要达到四十亿美元。这种状况不能不引起美国官方的惊慌。负责经济事务的美国副国务卿狄龙前几天惊呼“这样大量的赤字当然不能继续下去”，而要求西方各国对美国放宽贸易限制。美国经济开发委员会主席尼耳甚至说得更可怜：“正如欧洲在复兴时期需要我们的帮助一样，现在我们需要欧洲的帮助……”。美国经济地位的削弱，正是最近一段时期以来它在西方阵营中的领导地位削弱的重要原因之一。
    和平力量与“冷战”势力继续斗争
    在整个国际舞台上，两种势力继续在斗争着。苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫对美国的访问，苏联提出的关于全面彻底裁军的建议，正在全世界继续发生巨大的影响。同苏联一起，欧亚各个社会主义国家最近也为缓和国际紧张局势、保障欧亚和平、维护和增进同亚非民族独立国家的友谊进行了新的努力。所有这些都得到了世界爱好和平人民的热烈欢迎和支持。正是因为这样，帝国主义“冷战势力”遭到了沉重的打击，国际局势的气温在最近有些转暖。
    由于和平共处是人心所向，大势所趋，帝国主义的“实力政策”受到严重挫败，美国领导人最近也发表了某些和平言论，并表示同意以和平方式来解决国际争端。但是人们不能只看到言论，还必须看事实。
    在最近这一段时间内，美国仍然在到处加强军事集团、军事基地和军事演习；在西德加紧复活军国主义，在日本力促修改“安全条约”以复活日本军国主义，加强美日军事侵略同盟；在老挝指使萨纳尼空集团疯狂迫害苏发努冯等爱国者以进一步扩大老挝内战；在联合国大会挟持许多国家通过所谓“西藏问题”的决议，干涉中国内政，制造新的“冷战”。恰恰是在各国人民普遍要求缓和紧张局势的时候，美国参院外交委员会发表报告鼓吹要以加强北大西洋侵略集团为美国外交政策的“超越一切的目的”，督促北大西洋国家加紧实现建立三十个常备师和六十个后备师的备战目标，主张给西欧国家以核武器装备，并要求美国建立“高度机动的战略后备力量”。也恰恰是在这个时候，美国军方宣布要在今年年底以前派三十九个导弹中队去西欧加强美国的导弹基地，并且决定要在美国占领的冲绳岛中部进行二十四次导弹试验。此外，美国政府再次拒绝了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议关于促使美国军队撤出南朝鲜、争取朝鲜和平统一的呼吁。
    所有这一切，都清楚地表明，争取缓和紧张局势与维护世界和平的斗争，是一个长期的、曲折的、反复的斗争。
    老挝和古巴人民反对美国干涉
    在最近这半个月内，老挝人民和古巴人民反对美帝国主义干涉内政、企图扩大老挝内战和颠覆古巴革命政府的斗争，也引起了世界各国舆论的密切注意。
    老挝萨纳尼空政府在美国指使下挑起的内战，不但没有实现消灭前寮国战斗部队的阴谋，反而搬起石头砸了自己的脚，使自己在国内进一步陷于孤立和进退两难的地步。在这种情况下，美国最近指使萨纳尼空政府对已被非法扣押的老挝爱国战线党的领导人苏发努冯亲王等人加紧进行迫害。老挝当局最近宣布，要以所谓“阴谋叛国”罪对苏发努冯等人进行非法“审讯”。与此同时，美国也在联合国进行活动，阴谋组织和派遣一个所谓联合国常设委员会到老挝去。美萨集团的目的，是企图打击老挝爱国战线党的领导机关和这个党的合法地位，以便堵塞一切通过谈判和平解决老挝问题的途径，进一步扩大老挝内战。
    但是，美帝国主义和萨纳尼空集团的这种罪恶阴谋，已经激起了老挝人民的极大愤怒和坚决反对。连日来，老挝爱国战线党各地组织和各地人民纷纷集会和通电抗议美萨集团对苏发努冯等人的新的迫害。老挝爱国战线党中央委员会副主席费当已致电日内瓦会议的两位主席，要求采取紧急措施，立即制止老挝当局对苏发努冯的迫害行为。老挝人民反对美帝国主义干涉的爱国斗争，也得到了各国正义舆论的支持。苏联出席联合国大会代表团已发表声明，反对联合国组织和派遣所谓常设委员会到老挝去。我国陈毅外长也致函日内瓦会议两位主席，要求制止老挝政府非法审判苏发努冯，并坚决主张根据日内瓦协议通过谈判来和平解决老挝问题，以缓和印度支那的紧张局势。
    古巴人民反对美国干涉内政和保卫古巴革命成果的斗争，最近也有了新的高涨。10月26日，古巴人民在哈瓦那举行了百万人的示威集会，愤怒抗议美国政府威胁古巴土地改革、指使古巴反革命分子阴谋进行武装叛乱和来自美国的飞机袭击古巴首都哈瓦那的挑衅行为。古巴革命政府在坚决镇压了卡马圭省前武装部队司令马托斯的叛乱阴谋以后，已宣布恢复革命法庭，同时决定对全国工农和其他阶层的爱国人士实行普遍军事训练，以便武装起来保卫祖国安全。古巴人民的这个正义斗争无疑地将继续得到拉丁美洲各国人民和全世界一切爱好和平的人民的同情和支持。
