High-Speed Construction
— On the Deeds of the Second Working Section of the Second Team of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Company’s Furnace Building Company

The Second Working Section of the Second Team of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Company’s Furnace Building Company is a chimney construction team specializing in the building of chimneys, with a total of 93 workers. In March and April of this year, together with other fraternal working sections, they completed the pouring of the 100-meter chimney shafts for Wuhan Iron and Steel's No. 1 and No. 2 open-hearth furnaces in 14 and 12 days respectively. This speed is eight times faster than the speed of building chimneys for the Thermal Power Plant in 1956, six times faster than the No. 1 100-meter chimney for Coke Oven in 1957, 2.5 times faster than the No. 3 100-meter chimney for Coke Oven in 1958, and five to seven days faster than the national record of 19 days for completing a 100-meter chimney set by Baotou Steel in 1958, setting a new national record. This victory is a victory for the leadership of the Party, a victory for the General Line, a victory for vigorously launching mass movements, and a powerful counterattack against reactionary elements at home and abroad and right-leaning opportunists.

At the beginning of this year, they accepted the construction task of the 100-meter chimneys for the open-hearth furnaces. The engineering volume of this chimney is 446 cubic meters of concrete, requiring 130 tons of cement, equivalent to 60% of the working section's task in the first quarter of 1958; moreover, it was winter construction, and the inner diameter of the chimney was small, making construction inconvenient. If the progress of 1958 was followed, it would take 35 days to complete. However, Wuhan Iron and Steel's No. 1 and No. 2 open-hearth furnaces were to be put into production ahead of schedule this year, and this chimney became an important project related to the nation's efforts to seize 12 million tons of steel. All the workers in the Second Working Section realized that they must complete this arduous and glorious task with greater speed and better quality. Just as they were brewing the construction plan, news came that Baotou Steel had completed a 100-meter chimney in 19 days. The workers were both surprised and delighted. They were happy to have a direction, but surprised that it was so fast. Some said, "We completed a 120-meter chimney in 45 days, which is fast enough." A few cadres and technicians with skeptical attitudes said, "The weather is cold, the curing time is long, and our project requires 35 days according to the work procedures, and at least 25 days at the shortest." Due to the influence of this conservative thinking, the construction progress never broke through 19 days in the preparation of the construction plan.

Under these circumstances, the Party branch, in order to accelerate the construction speed, proposed to launch the first shot of 1959, ensure quality and safety, and catch up with Baotou Steel. At the same time, it mobilized all the workers by informing them of the great significance of pouring the open-hearth furnace chimneys and launched a great airing of views, a great debate on the construction plan, on whether it was possible to leap forward, whether it was possible to surpass Baotou Steel, how to ensure quality and safety, and the construction plan. This debate was a fierce struggle between advanced and conservative thinking, a struggle between two ideologies and two methods of implementing more, faster, better, and more economical versus less, slower, worse, and more expensive. In this struggle, the working section, according to the Party branch's arrangements, mobilized both inside and outside the Party, and held various symposiums and Zhuge Liang meetings to carefully calculate accounts, think of ways, and innovate construction methods. After carefully calculating the accounts according to each work procedure, everyone believed that if continuous pouring was carried out, eight meters a day, the task could be completed in 13 days, and it was certain that it could be completed in 15 days with some allowance. The masses expressed their determination: "Establish heroic ambitions, fight a great battle in 1959, leap forward again and again, and catch up with the nation's front." As a result, their determination was realized ahead of schedule. No. 1 chimney was completed in 14 days, and No. 2 chimney was completed in 12 days.

Not only must it be fast, but also the quality and safety must be guaranteed. In order to achieve this, the working section Party committee put forward the instruction of taking quality and safety as the center and vigorously carrying out rapid construction, and the Party branch put forward the requirement of "concrete as solid as a rock, no exposed steel bars, no broken skin." The Party groups repeatedly discussed these instructions, and criticized the idea that "if it is fast, it cannot be good, and if it is good, it cannot be fast." At the same time, they mobilized the masses to formulate specific measures and operating procedures for ensuring the quality of each work procedure based on summarizing past experiences. In terms of safety, many strict and meticulous methods were also implemented according to the Party branch's requirement of "not dropping a nail or a piece of wood." Each group established quality inspectors, safety officers, tool keepers, material clerks, and communicators, who jointly inspected with the captain and foreman, and as a result, good quality and good safety were achieved.

After the publication of the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, all the workers in the working section were greatly encouraged. In mid-September, they achieved a new victory: building the 60-meter brick chimney of the No. 2 soaking pit of the primary rolling mill, which took only 10 days to complete the brickwork of the chimney shaft and the lining, which was five days faster than the construction of the same type of brick chimney in Wuhan Iron and Steel, creating a new record for brick chimney construction. Thanks to their active efforts and the active efforts of all the workers in the team, the team completed this year's planned workload three months and seventeen days ahead of schedule by September 13, setting up a red banner of high-quality and fast construction.

    高速度地建设
    ——记武钢筑炉公司二队二工段的事迹
    武汉钢铁公司筑炉公司二队二工段是一支烟囱专业建设队，全段职工九十三人。在今年3、4月间，和其他兄弟工段一起，先后以十四天和十二天的工期，完成了武钢一、二号平炉一百米烟囱筒身浇灌的任务。这个速度比1956年热电厂建筑烟囱的速度快八倍，比1957年焦化一号一百米烟囱快六倍，比1958年焦化三号一百米烟囱快二点五倍，比包钢在1958年创造的一百米烟囱十九天完工的全国纪录快五天到七天，创造了全国最高纪录。这一胜利是党的领导的胜利，是总路线的胜利，是大搞群众运动的胜利，是对国内外反动派和右倾机会主义分子的有力回击。
    今年年初，他们接受了平炉一百米烟囱的施工任务。这座烟囱的工程量有四百四十六立方米混凝土，需用水泥一百三十吨，相当于这个工段1958年第一季度任务的60％；而且是冬季施工，烟囱内径小，施工不便。如果按1958年的进度，要三十五天才能完成。但是，武钢一、二号平炉要在今年提前投入生产，这个烟囱就成为关系着全国夺取一千二百万吨钢的有重大意义的工程。二工段的全体职工都意识到必须以更快的速度、更好的质量来完成这一艰巨而又光荣的任务。正当酝酿施工方案的时候，传来了包钢十九天完成一百米烟囱的消息。职工们又惊又喜，喜的是有了方向，惊的是想不到这样快。有的说：“我们四十五天完成了一百二十米烟囱已经够快了。”少数抱着怀疑态度的干部和技术人员说：“天气冷，养生时间长，我们的工程按工序计算要三十五天，最短也得二十五天”。由于这种保守思想的影响，在编制施工计划中，施工进度始终没有突破十九天。
    在这种情况下，党支部为了加快施工速度，提出要打响1959年的第一炮，保质量、保安全，赶在包钢前面。同时又把灌筑平炉烟囱的重大意义向全体职工作了动员，发动群众讨论施工方案，对能不能跃进、能不能超过包钢、如何保证质量和安全等问题以及施工方案，展开了大鸣大放大辩论。这次辩论是一场先进思想和保守思想的激烈斗争，是贯彻多快好省还是少慢差费的两种思想和两种方法的斗争。在这场斗争中，工段根据支部的布置，党内外一齐动员，并召开各种座谈会、诸葛亮会，算细账，想办法，革新施工方法。经过按各个工序算细账，大家认为如连续不停地浇灌，一天八米，十三天便可完成任务，宽打一点十五天是有把握的。群众表示决心：“立下英雄志，大战1959年，跃进再跃进，赶在全国前。”结果，他们的决心提前实现了，一号烟囱十四天完成，二号烟囱十二天便完成了。
    不仅要快，而且要保证质量和安全。为了做到这一点，工段党委提出了以质量安全为中心，大搞快速施工的指示，党支部提出了“混凝土坚如磐石，不露筋不破皮”的要求。对这些指示，党小组都进行了反复讨论，并且批判了“要快不能好，要好不能快”的思想，同时发动群众在总结过去经验的基础上，制订了各个工序保证质量的具体措施和操作规程。在安全方面，也根据党支部提出的“不掉一钉一木”的要求，实行了很多严格细致的办法。各小组都建立了质量检查员、安全员、工具保管员、材料员和通讯员，和队长、工长共同检查，结果做到了质量好、安全好。
    党的八届八中全会公报和决议公布以后，全段职工受到极大鼓舞，在9月中又取得了新的胜利：砌筑初轧厂二号均热炉六十米砖烟囱，仅用了十天便完成了烟囱筒身和内衬的砌筑任务，比在武钢修建同类型的砖烟囱快了五天，创造了砖烟囱施工新纪录。由于他们和全队职工的积极努力，到9月13日为止，全队提前三个月零十七天完成了今年的计划工作量，树立起一面优质快速施工的红旗。
