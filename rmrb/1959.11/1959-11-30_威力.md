    Power
    Bai Sheng
    After more than a year of development, scientific research work in national universities and colleges has seen an unprecedented flourishing situation. Tens of thousands of teachers and hundreds of thousands of students have enthusiastically participated in scientific research work. The research results are rich and colorful, greatly exceeding the achievements of the past few years. A vibrant new army of science is growing stronger in battle.
    The leap forward in scientific research work in universities and colleges proves that the Party's policy of mass participation in scientific research and vigorous tackling of cutting-edge technologies is completely correct. Therefore, it has unleashed tremendous power and achieved brilliant accomplishments in a short period of just over a year.
    Some bourgeois experts once described scientific research work as mysterious and unattainable, claiming that only a few people with "scientific minds" and "scientific genius" could engage in it, and that the masses could not possibly be involved. Dominated by bourgeois individualism, they regarded scientific research work as their personal property and dared not mobilize the masses to participate. They merely shut themselves off and worked in isolation, resulting in scientific research work being divorced from the masses and from reality. The Party-led mass-based and vigorous scientific research has swept away the past cold and desolate atmosphere in scientific research and thoroughly shattered the mystique surrounding scientific research. When the masses liberated their minds and unleashed soaring enthusiasm, their wisdom and power broke through the mysterious door of scientific research, creating countless miracles. Facts have proven that the power of the masses is infinite, and although scientific research work is a complex and meticulous mental labor, it ultimately arises from labor practice. As long as the laws of scientific research are grasped, it is not something unattainable. Through everyone's hard work and the convergence of the wisdom of the masses and experts, research work will yield rich results. Isn't the fact that teachers and students of Tsinghua University completed more than 1,200 scientific and technological research projects and published and compiled more than 800 scientific papers and technical materials in a year and a half sufficient proof?
    Of course, this does not mean that the mass line in scientific research is no different from the mass line in other work. There are differences in methods and approaches. We must not only recognize the characteristics of scientific research work in schools, but also resolutely mobilize the masses to make scientific research work develop more healthily. At the same time, in scientific research work, giving play to the role of the masses must be combined with giving play to the role of experts. Mobilizing the masses includes experts, enabling experts and the masses to combine, and teachers and students to combine. Practice has proven that only in this way can the role of experts be better发挥ed, and experts can only exert greater power when they combine with the research of the masses, rely on the masses, and believe in the masses. It is difficult to imagine that a major scientific research project can be quickly successful if it does not mobilize the power of the masses to think and act together, but instead relies on a certain expert to conduct research alone behind closed doors.
    Last year and this year, the power of the masses in scientific research work in universities and colleges completely shattered the bourgeois individualistic research direction and replaced it with a completely new collectivist research direction, large-scale collaboration, big strides, and common progress. This kind of power needs to be greatly developed in the future. With this kind of power, our scientific research work will be full of vitality and constantly move forward.

    威力

    全国高等学校的科学研究工作，经过一年多的发展，出现了一个空前繁荣的局面。数万教师和几十万学生热情澎湃地参加了科学研究工作。研究成果丰富多采，大大超过了过去几年的成就。一支朝气蓬勃的科学新军已在战斗中茁壮地成长起来。
    高等学校科学研究工作的跃进，证明党所领导的群众性的大搞科学研究、猛攻尖端技术的方针，是完全正确的。因此，它发出了巨大的威力，在短短一年多的时间里取得了辉煌的成就。
    某些资产阶级专家，曾经把科学研究工作说成是神秘莫测，高不可攀，只有少数具有“科学头脑”、“科学天才”的人才能去搞，群众是无从问津的。他们在资产阶级个人主义的思想支配下，把科学研究工作当作个人的私产，根本不敢发动群众来搞，只是自己闭门造车，冷冷清清地单干，结果是科学研究工作既脱离群众，也脱离实际。党所领导的群众性的轰轰烈烈的科学研究，一扫过去科学研究中那种冷冷清清的局面，彻底打破了科学研究中的神秘观点。当群众解放了思想，发挥了冲天的干劲，他们的智慧和威力冲破了科学研究的神秘大门，创造出无数的奇迹来。事实证明，群众的力量是无穷的，科学研究工作虽然是一种复杂细致的脑力劳动，但他终归是在劳动实践中产生的。只要掌握了科学研究的规律，并不是什么高不可攀的事情。经过大家的刻苦钻研，群众和专家智慧的汇合，研究工作就会获得丰富成果的。清华大学师生一年半中完成了一千二百多项科学技术研究工作；发表和编写了八百多篇科学论文和技术资料，这还不是充分的说明吗？
    当然，这并不是说科学研究中群众路线和其他工作中的群众路线一点没有区别了，在方式方法上是有区别的，我们既要看到学校科学研究工作的特点，也必须坚决地发动群众，使科学研究工作更健康地发展起来。同时，在科学研究工作中，发挥群众的作用还必须同发挥专家的作用相结合。发动群众是把专家包括在内的，使专家和群众结合，教师和学生结合。实践证明，只有这样，才能更好地发挥专家的作用，而专家也只有同群众的研究相结合，依靠群众、相信群众，才能发挥出更大的力量。一项重大的科学研究工作，如果不发挥群众的力量大家动脑动手来搞，而只靠某个专家独自闭门单干研究，很难想像会很快获得成功的。
    去年和今年，高等学校科学研究工作中的群众威力，彻底打破了资产阶级的个人主义的研究方向，代之以完全崭新的集体主义的研究方向，大协作，迈大步，共同前进。这种威力，今后还需要大大发扬。有了这种威力，我们的科学研究工作就会生气勃勃，不断前进。
