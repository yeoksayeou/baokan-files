The Soviet Union has made outstanding contributions to helping fraternal countries carry out socialist construction. In the twelve years after the war, the total amount of loans granted by the Soviet Union to fraternal countries reached 28 billion rubles. The Soviet Union supplied and will supply complete sets of equipment for more than 700 large industrial enterprises and individual workshops to fraternal countries.

On the basis of complete equality, mutual benefit, and comradely mutual assistance, socialist countries have established extensive economic and cultural cooperation among themselves. This plays an important role in consolidating the economic and political independence of each socialist country and in consolidating the entire socialist family. In the future, socialist countries will continue to expand and improve their economic and cultural cooperation.

Xinhua News Agency, November 4th: Fraternal and extensive economic cooperation among socialist countries is constantly developing and strengthening under the principle of proletarian internationalism. The Soviet Union has made outstanding contributions to helping fraternal countries carry out socialist construction, with a view to achieving common prosperity and upsurge in the socialist family of nations.

According to statistics, three-quarters of the Soviet Union's foreign trade goods are delivered to fraternal countries. The Soviet Union's foreign trade with fraternal countries has increased by approximately 5.7 times in the twelve years after the war, and the total amount of loans granted to fraternal countries has reached 28 billion rubles.

Economic cooperation among socialist countries is carried out in a variety of forms, based on the characteristics of each country's economic development and their economic construction and needs.

Foreign trade is a form of economic cooperation among socialist countries. In recent years, foreign trade among socialist countries has greatly developed. In 1958, the foreign trade volume among the member states of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (Soviet Union and Eastern European socialist countries) increased by 1.5 times compared to 1950. A characteristic of foreign trade is that machinery and equipment account for a large proportion. Among them, the Soviet Union exports the most machinery and equipment to fraternal countries. During the period of 1946-1958, the Soviet Union's exports in this area increased 14 times, with a value of approximately 16 billion rubles. Fraternal countries also obtained commodities such as iron ore, coal, and ferrous metals from the Soviet Union, and their quantity increased more than nine times in the twelve years after the war. The Soviet Union also imported what it needed from fraternal countries, such as ships from Poland, and machinery and equipment from the German Democratic Republic and Czechoslovakia.

The supply of complete sets of equipment for industrial enterprises among socialist countries has increased year by year. According to agreements, the Soviet Union has supplied and will supply complete sets of equipment for more than 700 large industrial enterprises and individual workshops to fraternal countries. After these projects are completed and put into production, they will increase the production capacity of the industrial sectors of each fraternal country, such as an increase of 50 billion kilowatt-hours in electricity, 15 million tons in pig iron, 17.9 million tons in steel, 9.8 million tons in steel products, 37.6 million tons in coal, 6 million tons in coke, and 1.06 million tons in refined copper. Other products such as machine manufacturing and chemical industry products will also have a great increase. In order to help install and put into production, the Soviet Union also sent highly skilled experts to work in fraternal countries. Fraternal countries also provided similar assistance to the Soviet Union.

Providing loans and giving financial and economic assistance among socialist countries is one of the important forms of economic cooperation. From 1956 to 1959, the Soviet Union granted loans of 1.2 billion rubles to Poland, 850 million rubles to Hungary, and 420 million rubles to the German Democratic Republic. Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and China also received large loans from the Soviet Union.

Jointly constructing industrial enterprises, railways, and other construction projects, as well as jointly utilizing resources, is another form of economic cooperation among socialist countries. For example, the German Democratic Republic, Poland, and Czechoslovakia jointly developed the Danube Delta in southeastern Romania with Romania, and established paper mills there to process reeds. The Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary jointly constructed a "Friendship Bridge" across the Danube River between Giurgiu in Romania and Ruse in Bulgaria with Romania and Bulgaria. The German Democratic Republic and Czechoslovakia cooperated with Poland to exploit Poland's lignite. In this cooperation, the German Democratic Republic and Czechoslovakia also granted Poland long-term loans of 400 million and 250 million rubles respectively.

Specialization and collaboration in production and coordination of annual and long-term plans among socialist countries are more advanced forms of economic cooperation among socialist countries. It marks a new stage in economic cooperation among socialist countries. This long-term, comprehensive, and planned cooperation can make the economic development of the cooperating countries more favorable. The Seventh Session of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance held in Berlin in 1956 adopted suggestions on the long-term coordination of major sectors of the national economy from 1956 to 1960. At the Eighth Session, it was proposed to coordinate the major sectors of the national economy of the member states for a long period of ten or fifteen years. According to these suggestions, countries can increase the production of products that are most favorable in terms of their own economic and technical conditions, and relatively reduce the production of products that are economically and technically unfavorable. For example, the Soviet Union, the German Democratic Republic, Hungary, and Poland produce self-propelled grain combine harvesters, and Czechoslovakia buys these machines from these countries, while concentrating on producing flax harvesters. Similar coordination can reduce the production of lathes in Hungary from 20 types to 16, in the German Democratic Republic from 64 to 56, and in Poland and Czechoslovakia from 40 to 35 and from 62 to 42 respectively.

All of this effectively promotes the rapid development of the economies of the socialist countries, enabling the economic power of the socialist countries to leap faster to a leading position in the economic competition with capitalist countries.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 5th: While the economic cooperation among countries in the socialist camp is constantly developing, their scientific and technological cooperation is also expanding daily. Due to this close cooperation, socialist countries are able to fully utilize the most advanced scientific and technological achievements to vigorously promote the development of the national economy.

Scientific and technological cooperation among socialist countries is multifaceted and is expanding and growing year by year. The characteristic of this cooperation is joint research and mutual assistance. According to the many scientific and technological cooperation agreements signed among socialist countries in recent years, the scientific research departments of these countries have now established close cooperative ties. They exchange advanced scientific and technological research data and jointly study and solve the most important problems in current science and technology. At present, the scope of scientific and technological cooperation among socialist countries is very wide, including the peaceful use of atomic energy, radio electronics, metallurgy, electricity, chemistry, petroleum, machine manufacturing, automation and mechanization, and medicine. According to statistics, in the past ten years, socialist countries have exchanged more than 28,000 complete sets of production technology data alone, and 25,000 scientists have visited each other to exchange experiences.

Scientific and technological cooperation among socialist countries plays an increasingly significant role in promoting their development of advanced science and technology and developing the national economy. Thanks to the help of the Soviet Union, many socialist countries have now established the most advanced modern equipment for atomic energy research. In socialist countries such as China, Romania, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, and Poland, the Soviet Union's advanced metallurgical, forging, machine manufacturing, ball bearing, mining, and other advanced technologies and experiences are widely used. The Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia are also increasingly adopting the advanced technologies of other socialist countries in automation, mechanization, chemistry, medicine, and other fields. In Soviet textile factories, the experience of the German Democratic Republic in producing elastic fibers is being utilized. Soviet scholars have adopted the experience of Romanian scholar Petrescu in using the electric arc cracking method to obtain acetylene, which can not only greatly shorten the time for manufacturing this product, but also reduce its cost by half, saving the country 500 million rubles during the Seven-Year Plan.

In recent years, scientific and technological cooperation among socialist countries has undergone new developments. In addition to the bilateral cooperation agreements signed between countries, countries regularly hold meetings of experts in scientific and economic departments to jointly study and solve the various major problems in the current development of science and technology. At the same time, the ties between the scientific research institutions of various countries are also closer than before. At present, 314 scientific and technological research institutes in the Soviet Union have established close ties with 372 scientific institutions in other socialist countries, and are jointly studying 1,958 scientific and technological problems according to jointly formulated plans. The further strengthening of scientific and technological cooperation among socialist countries is of great significance not only for solving major current scientific and technological problems and for developing science and the economy, but also for socialist countries to win time and achieve decisive victory in the economic competition with capitalism.

    社会主义大家庭互助合作共同繁荣
    苏联在帮助兄弟国家进行社会主义建设方面作出了杰出的贡献。战后十二年来，苏联给予各兄弟国家贷款总数达二百八十亿卢布。苏联供给了和将要供给各兄弟国家七百多个大的工业企业和单独车间的成套设备。
    在完全平等、互利和同志般互助的基础上，社会主义各国建立了相互间的广泛的经济和文化合作。这对于巩固各个社会主义国家的经济和政治独立，对于巩固整个社会主义大家庭，起着重要的作用。今后，社会主义各国将继续扩大和改善它们之间的经济和文化合作。
    ——摘自1957年“社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议宣言”
    新华社4日讯　社会主义国家之间兄弟般的、广泛的经济合作在无产阶级国际主义原则下，不断发展和加强。苏联在帮助各兄弟国家进行社会主义建设，以期达到社会主义国家大家庭的共同繁荣和高涨方面，作出了杰出贡献。
    据统计，苏联对外贸易货物的四分之三是输送给各兄弟国家的。苏联同各兄弟国家的对外贸易在战后十二年来增加了大约五点七倍，给予各兄弟国家的贷款总数达二百八十亿卢布。
    社会主义国家之间的经济合作是根据各国经济发展的特点和它们的经济建设和需要，通过多种多样的形式进行的。
    对外贸易是社会主义国家经济合作的一种形式。近几年来，社会主义国家之间的对外贸易有了很大的发展。1958年，八国经济互助委员会成员国（苏联和东欧社会主义国家）之间的对外贸易额比1950年增加了一点五倍。在对外贸易中的一个特点是：机器和设备占很大的比重。其中，苏联向各兄弟国家出口的机器和设备最多，在1946—1958年这一时期，苏联在这方面的出口增加了十四倍，价值约达一百六十亿卢布。各兄弟国家还从苏联得到铁矿砂、煤、黑色金属等商品，其数量在战后十二年中增加了九倍多。苏联也从各兄弟国家进口了它所需要的东西，如从波兰进口船只，从德意志民主共和国和捷克斯洛伐克进口机器设备等。
    社会主义国家之间互相供给工业企业的成套设备逐年增多。根据协定，苏联供给了和将要供给各兄弟国家七百多个大的工业企业和单独车间。这些项目建成和投入生产后，将提高各个兄弟国家工业部门的生产能力，如电力提高五百亿度，铸铁一千五百万吨，钢一千七百九十万吨，钢材九百八十万吨，煤三千七百六十万吨，焦炭六百万吨，精铜一千零六十万吨。其它如机器制造和化学工业产品等也将有很大的提高。为帮助安装和投入生产，苏联还派遣了具有很高水平的专家去兄弟国家工作。兄弟国家也给予苏联以类似的帮助。
    社会主义国家之间提供贷款和给予财政、经济援助，是经济合作的重要形式之一。苏联从1956—1959年给予波兰的贷款达十二亿卢布，给匈牙利的达八亿五千万卢布，给德意志民主共和国四亿二千万卢布。罗马尼亚、保加利亚、阿尔巴尼亚、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、越南民主共和国和中国也从苏联得到了大量贷款。
    合力建设工业企业、铁路和其它建设项目，以及共同利用资源等，是社会主义国家经济合作的另一种形式。例如，德意志民主共和国、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克同罗马尼亚共同开发位于罗马尼亚东南部的多瑙河三角洲，在那里建立加工芦苇的造纸工厂。苏联、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利同罗马尼亚、保加利亚共同在罗马尼亚的朱尔朱港和保加利亚的鲁西之间建设了一座通过多瑙河的“友谊桥”。德意志民主共和国、捷克斯洛伐克同波兰合作开采波兰的褐煤。在这一合作中，德意志民主共和国和捷克斯洛伐克还分别给予波兰四亿和二亿五千万卢布的长期贷款。
    社会主义国家生产专业化和协作、协调年度和远景计划，是社会主义国家经济合作的更高级形式。它标志着社会主义国家经济合作的新阶段。这种长期、全面、有计划的合作，可以使相互配合的国家经济发展更加有利。经济互助委员会1956年在柏林召开的第七次会议，通过了1956—1960年发展国民经济主要部门长期配合问题的建议。在第八次会议上又提出了各成员国国民经济主要部门在十年或十五年长期协作的问题。根据这些建议，各国可以增加那些从本国经济和技术条件来说最为有利的产品的生产，而相对地减少那些经济和技术条件不利的产品的生产，例如，苏联、德意志民主共和国、匈牙利、波兰生产自动推进式谷物联合收割机，捷克斯洛伐克向这些国家购买这种机器，而自己则集中力量生产亚麻收割机。类似这样的配合，就可以使匈牙利的车床生产由二十种减少到十六种，德意志民主共和国由六十四种减少到五十六种，波兰、捷克斯洛伐克分别由四十减到三十五种，由六十二减到四十二种。
    所有这一切有效地促进各社会主义国家的经济的迅速发展，使社会主义国家的经济威力在同资本主义国家的经济竞赛中更快地跃向领先地位。
    新华社莫斯科5日电　在社会主义阵营各国不断发展经济合作的同时，它们之间的科学和技术合作也在日益扩大。由于这方面的紧密合作，社会主义各国能够充分利用最先进的科学技术成就，来大力促进国民经济的发展。
    社会主义国家之间的科学技术合作是多方面的，而且在逐年扩大和增长着。这种合作的特点是共同研究和相互帮助。根据近年来各社会主义国家之间签订的许多科学技术合作协定，目前，这些国家的科学研究部门都建立了紧密的合作联系。它们交换先进的科学技术研究资料，共同研究解决当前科学技术中的最重要问题。现在，社会主义国家之间科学技术合作范围非常广泛，包括和平利用原子能、无线电电子学、冶金、电力、化学、石油、机器制造、自动化和机械化、医学等方面。据统计，十多年来，社会主义各国之间单是交换全套的生产技术资料即达二万八千多件，并且有二万五千名科学家进行了相互的访问，交流了经验。
    社会主义国家之间的科学技术合作对于促进它们发展先进的科学技术、发展国民经济起着越来越显著的作用。由于苏联的帮助，现在，许多社会主义国家已经建立起了最先进的进行原子能研究的现代设备。在中国、罗马尼亚、捷克斯洛伐克、德意志民主共和国、波兰等社会主义国家里广泛地采用着苏联先进的冶金、锻压、机器制造、滚珠轴承、采矿等等先进技术经验。苏联、捷克斯洛伐克也越来越多地采用其他社会主义国家在自动化、机械化、化学、医学等方面的先进技术。苏联的纺织厂里，正在利用着德意志民主共和国生产富有弹性的纤维的经验。苏联学者们采用了罗马尼亚学者佩特雷斯克运用电弧裂化法获取乙炔的经验，不仅可以大大缩短制造这种产品的时间，而且可以使它的成本降低一半，在七年计划期间为国家节约五亿卢布。
    近年来，社会主义各国之间的科学技术合作有了新的发展。除了各国之间签订双边的合作协定之外，各国经常举行科学和经济部门的专家会议，共同研究解决当前科学技术发展中的各项具有头等重大意义的问题。同时，各国的科学研究机关之间的联系也比以前密切了。目前，苏联有三百一十四个科学技术研究所同其他社会主义国家的三百七十二个科学机关建立有密切联系，按照共同制定的计划，正在合力研究一千九百五十八个科学技术问题。社会主义各国之间的科学技术合作的进一步加强，不仅对于解决当前科学技术重大问题以及发展科学和经济具有重要意义，而且对于社会主义国家在同资本主义进行经济竞赛中赢得时间和取得决定性胜利也具有重要意义。
