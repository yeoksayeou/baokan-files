Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 20th: “The Voice of the Algerian Republic” radio station broadcast tonight an order from the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of National Defense of the Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic, Belkacem Krim, to all officers and soldiers of the Algerian National Liberation Army, calling on them to "persist in and intensify the fight against the enemy in order to win favorable conditions for the implementation of self-determination and the achievement of independence."

The order stated, "We will continue to strengthen our army until we have received any truly reliable guarantees." The armed forces, founded in 1954, are the most effective means for the Algerian people to strive for self-determination and exercise sovereignty.

The order said, "Five years of arduous war have tempered you into a battle-tested army full of confidence of victory - the Glorious National Liberation Army! Now our National Liberation Army is stronger and more determined than ever to carry out the war of liberation. The full support of the people throughout the country for our just cause, your heroic performance, and the victories you have won over the years have won the admiration of world opinion.

"Your struggle has forced the enemy to talk about the right to self-determination, thus shattering the myth that 'Algeria is France'."

The order then pointed out that "the colonialists are no longer able to continue to hinder our progress." Many French generals have repeatedly talked about the "final hour of battle," and that "pacification is about to end." But "you have shown with your heroic battles that our National Liberation Front and our National Liberation Army are stronger than ever before, we have consolidated and strengthened our position at home and abroad, and our powerful forces are fighting large-scale battles with the enemy.

The enemy has exhausted all means to force us to give up fighting, but we are getting stronger as we fight. We are closer to victory and closer to the goals we are striving for than ever before."

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 22nd: Algerian Minister of Culture, Tawfiq Maidani, commented on de Gaulle's rejection of negotiations with a delegation designated by the Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic, saying that the Algerian war would continue more fiercely than in the past until the Algerian people achieved independence.

The "Al-Ahram" newspaper today published Maidani's interview with the newspaper's reporter. Maidani said, "As long as we have not reached an agreement on the implementation of the right to self-determination and on guarantees for this right, the war will continue, and will be more intense than it is now."

"Al-Akhbar" also quoted Algerian sources in Cairo as saying that de Gaulle's rejection of Algeria's proposal exposed his true intentions hidden behind his claim to be ready for negotiations. These sources further said that de Gaulle has been proclaiming that he wants to hold negotiations with the Algerian government. He attempted to create a false impression through this approach, namely: that it is the Algerians who are intent on waging a bloody war.

These sources also made it clear that even if de Gaulle holds negotiations with the responsible authorities of the Algerian government, the Algerian National Liberation Army cannot stop fighting. They said that unless both sides reach a solution acceptable to the Algerian people, that is, to achieve independence, the war will not stop.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 22nd: Newspapers here today published talks by diplomatic figures from Arab countries. They denounced de Gaulle for refusing to negotiate with the representatives designated by the Algerian government and called on the people of the world to stand on the side of the Algerian people who are fighting.

Acting Secretary-General of the Arab League, Mustafa, said that France's refusal to release the arrested Algerian leaders and to negotiate with them shows that France's claim to recognize the Algerian people's right to self-determination is only a means, especially when the Algerians have expressed their willingness to resolve the issue through negotiations.

Moroccan Ambassador to Cairo, Torres, said that history has proven the fact that imperialists cannot give people freedom and independence.

Libyan Ambassador, Kalal, pointed out that de Gaulle's attitude clearly shows that his proposal is not sincere.

Representatives of Yemen and Saudi Arabia in Cairo also condemned France and expressed support for the Algerian people who are fighting for independence.

The Cairo "Al-Gomhuria" newspaper published an editorial saying that de Gaulle's rejection of the Algerian Provisional Government's proposal proves that his proposal to resolve the Algerian issue has never been serious. The newspaper added that in fact, it has been clear from the beginning that de Gaulle's proposal did not provide sufficient guarantees for any referendum on self-determination.

The newspaper concluded by saying that in view of de Gaulle's recent stubborn attitude, do not be deceived by France's deceptive tricks.

"Al-Akhbar" published an editorial asking where is the Algerian people's right to self-determination that the French are proclaiming if de Gaulle is to designate the Algerian negotiators with whom he is willing to negotiate? De Gaulle's hasty rejection only proves that his proposal has never been serious.

    阿尔及利亚副总理兼国防部长广播讲话
    号召民族解放军官兵坚持战斗
    阿拉伯国家政界人士支持阿尔及利亚正义斗争
    新华社开罗20日电　“阿尔及利亚共和国之声”电台今晚广播阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府副总理兼国防部长贝勒卡塞姆·克里姆向阿尔及利亚民族解放军全体官兵发布的命令，号召他们“坚持和加紧同敌人进行战斗，以争取实行自决、获得独立的有利条件。”
    命令说，“我们在没有得到任何确实可靠的保证以前，将不断加强我们的军队。”在1954年创立的武装部队，是阿尔及利亚人民争取自决和行使主权的最有效的手段。
    命令说，“五年的艰苦战争已经把你们锻炼成为一支久经考验和满怀胜利信心的军队——光荣的民族解放军。现在我们的民族解放军比过去任何时期都更加强大、更有决心来进行解放战争。全国人民对我们正义事业的全力支持、你们的英勇表现和几年来所获得的胜利，都博得了世界舆论的敬佩。
    “你们的战斗已经迫使敌人谈论自决权利，从而粉碎了什么‘阿尔及利亚是法国的’这一神话。”
    命令接着指出，“殖民主义者再也无力继续阻碍我们的前进。”许多法国将军曾经一再谈到什么“最后一刻钟的战斗”，什么“绥靖即将结束”。但是“你们用你们英勇的战斗表明我们的民族解放阵线、我们的民族解放军比过去更加壮大，我们巩固和加强了我们在国外和国内的地位，我们强大的部队正同敌军进行着大规模的战斗。
    敌人用尽一切办法想要迫使我们放弃战斗，但是我们愈战愈强。我们比过去更加接近胜利，更接近我们所争取的目标。”
    新华社开罗22日电　阿尔及利亚共和国文化部长陶菲克·迈达尼在评论戴高乐拒绝同阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府指派的代表团举行谈判这件事时说，阿尔及利亚战争将比过去更加激烈地进行下去，直到阿尔及利亚人民获得独立时为止。
    “金字塔报”今天刊载了迈达尼对这家报纸记者发表的谈话。迈达尼说，“只要我们还没有就实施自决权和就这种权利的保证达成协议，战争就将继续下去，并将比现在更为激烈。”
    “消息报”也援引在开罗的阿尔及利亚人士的话说，戴高乐拒绝阿尔及利亚的建议的做法暴露了他在声称准备谈判背后所隐藏着的真正意图。这些人士进一步说，戴高乐一直在宣扬，他要同阿尔及利亚政府举行谈判。他企图通过这种做法造成一种虚假的印象，即：一心要进行流血战争的是阿尔及利亚人。
    这些人士还明确表示，即使戴高乐同阿尔及利亚政府的负责当局举行谈判，阿尔及利亚民族解放军也不能停止战斗。他们说，除非双方达成为阿尔及利亚人民所能接受的解决办法，即实现独立，否则战争不会停止。
    新华社开罗22日电　此间报纸今天刊载了阿拉伯国家外交界人士的谈话。他们斥责戴高乐拒绝同阿尔及利亚政府指派的代表们谈判，并呼吁世界人民站在正在进行斗争的阿尔及利亚人民一边。
    阿拉伯联盟代理秘书长穆斯塔法说，法国拒绝释放被捕的阿尔及利亚领袖、拒绝同他们谈判的做法表明：法国声称承认阿尔及利亚人民的自决权，只是一种手段，特别是在阿尔及利亚人表示愿意通过谈判解决问题的时候。
    摩洛哥驻开罗大使托雷斯说，历史证明了这一事实：帝国主义者是不可能给予人民以自由和独立的。
    利比亚大使卡拉勒指出，戴高乐的态度清楚地表明，他的建议是没有诚意的。
    也门和沙特阿拉伯驻开罗的代表也谴责法国，并表示支持正在为争取独立而斗争的阿尔及利亚人民。
    开罗“共和国报”发表社论说，戴高乐拒绝阿尔及利亚临时政府的建议一事证明，他提出解决阿尔及利亚问题的建议，从来就是不认真的。这家报纸又说，实际上，从一开始就很清楚，戴高乐的建议没有为解决自决的任何公民投票提供充分的保证。
    这家报纸最后说，鉴于戴高乐最近表示的顽固态度，决不要被法国的欺骗伎俩所蒙蔽。
    “消息报”发表社论问道，如果要由戴高乐来指定他愿意与之谈判的阿尔及利亚谈判代表，那么法国人所宣扬的阿尔及利亚人的自决权在那里呢？戴高乐急忙拒绝的做法只是证明了他的建议从来就是不认真的。
