　　We Love the Factory as Our Home
　　—A Visit to the Hai Phong Cement Plant in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam
　　By Our Correspondent Hu Benying

　　Stepping into Hai Phong Cement Plant, one of the large enterprises in North Vietnam, I was immediately attracted by a moving scene: on the construction site for expanding the factory buildings, the sounds of people, mixers, and bulldozers, coupled with the roar of heavy trucks, were deafening. In the workshops, the "Patriotic Emulation Movement" was surging, and the workers made a solemn pledge to the Party: they would definitely overfulfill this year's production plan to seize time for 1959.

　　Hai Phong Cement Plant, a large enterprise severely damaged by the French colonialists, has gone through a difficult recovery stage. Now, it is bursting with vigorous vitality, making great contributions to Vietnam's socialist construction.

　　Tragic History

　　The more than 6,000 employees of Hai Phong Cement Plant, while celebrating the factory's rebirth today, have not forgotten its tragic past.

　　In 1899, when Vietnam had already been reduced to a French colony, French capitalists represented by Louis Maseau, set their sights on the green stone mine (cement raw material) near Hai Phong and its coastal location. They chose the current factory site to start construction. Relying on the bayonets of the colonial army, the French capitalists forced the local farmers to demolish their houses, level their rice fields, and, after making them destitute, drove them to serve as coolies for the French capitalists. Thus, the workers built this massive factory with tears in their eyes.

　　"In the eyes of foreign capitalists, colonial workers were merely talking cattle and horses. Their exploitation and unreasonable insults to the workers were simply outrageous," said Comrade Fan Yumu, the head of the administrative section of this factory, a demobilized soldier who had fought against the French bandits on the battlefield, in a deep tone to the reporter. The ordinary workers in this factory had to work twelve or thirteen hours a day, but a strong male worker could only earn two dimes a day, while female workers and child laborers, although doing the same work as male workers, could only get one dime and five cents. Such meager wages were not enough to support a family, let alone maintain one's own life with only "one dry and two watery meals" a day. Even more hateful was that the French colonialists and foremen often arbitrarily extorted and insulted the workers, even often molesting female workers in broad daylight.

　　There was no labor protection in the factory, and industrial accidents occurred frequently. Injured workers did not receive treatment, and once they were disabled, they would be thrown out of the factory gate. Which of the old workers did not have scars on their bodies? The old worker Nguyen Wen Shun, who is now the watchman of the cement plant, had his arm cut off because of an injury. Fan Yumu's sister also worked as a female worker in this factory. Because she carried scalding hot mud slag on her head year after year, her hair fell out when she was still young.

　　The pain and sweat of the Vietnamese workers fattened those French masters. Fan Yumu told me a number: The French capitalists invested a total of 1.5 million francs to build the factory, and the profit in 1953 alone reached 487.97 million francs. From the establishment of the factory to the withdrawal of the French in 1955, how much blood and sweat did the French capitalists extract from the Vietnamese people in more than 50 years! The French masters built tall buildings in their own country and villas in Vietnamese summer resorts. Every brick and tile exuded a bloody smell!

　　The history of Hai Phong Cement Plant is actually a history of blood and tears of the Vietnamese people, and also a historical witness to the French colonialists' cruel plunder of the infinite wealth of Vietnam!

　　Indomitable Struggle

　　However, the Vietnamese working class was not a lamb to be slaughtered. From 1927, the workers of the cement plant carried out organized struggles. After the establishment of the Vietnamese Revolutionary Youth Comrade Association, it directly led the workers' struggle. The workers first shouted the resounding slogan of "Oppose beatings and scolding, oppose deduction of wages" to fight against the French capitalists' lackeys. Under the pressure of the workers' great momentum, the arrogance of the lackeys had to be somewhat restrained. Then, the workers turned the focus of their struggle to the French capitalists and demanded an increase in wages. May 1, 1929, was the most proud day for the workers. On this day, the first red flag was raised over this heavily guarded factory. It declared to the Vietnamese people: In this largest enterprise in Indochina, the workers had won a great victory.

　　On January 6, 1930, the Indochinese Communist Party was born. Since then, under the leadership of the Party, the workers of the cement plant launched a more heroic struggle along the correct direction.

　　In 1954, under the heavy blow of the Vietnamese people, the French colonialists were forced to sign the Geneva Agreement with the representatives of the Vietnamese people in Geneva. According to the agreement between the two parties, the French colonialists were to withdraw from Hai Phong in 1955. However, during this period, the French colonialists conspired to completely destroy the cement plant. Thus, a fierce anti-sabotage struggle of the workers unfolded.

　　"The cement plant belongs to the Vietnamese people, and the French are not allowed to destroy it!" Despite the fact that the French colonialists had set up private prisons in the factory at that time, unreasonably arrested and tortured workers, the workers were fearless and uttered angry roars. During the day, when the French pulled the dismantled machines out of the factory, the workers followed behind the cars to see where they were placed; at night, the workers quietly hid some important parts in the sewers.

　　The reporter visited the old worker and labor model Nguyen Wen Chun and the advanced producer Nguyen Wen Qian. When the French colonialists were frantically destroying the factory, they repeatedly risked their lives to hide all the parts that could be dismantled. After the People's Government took over the factory, they immediately returned those parts to the factory. They said: "The factory is the property of the country, and we workers are determined to protect it with our own strength." What simple and heroic words these were. This heroic action is a manifestation of the noble qualities of the Vietnamese working class. How could the French colonialists not suffer a shameful defeat in the face of such heroic people?

　　Must Let It "Rejuvenate"

　　After the French colonialists extensively destroyed the cement plant, they retreated with their tails between their legs and arrogantly said to the Vietnamese workers: "If you want to restore production, it will take at least two years." However, the predictions of these blind old men burst like soap bubbles!

　　Under the battle call of the Labor Party to accelerate economic recovery, a large number of demobilized soldiers who had experienced hundreds of battles were sent to work at the cement plant. Just like they fought in the battlefield to annihilate the French colonial army, today they are leading the heroic working class to win new victories on the industrial front. The workers were even more high-spirited, and they swore to the Party as masters of the country: "We must let the cement plant ‘rejuvenate’ as soon as possible and serve the national construction!"

　　At that time, the rich land of Vietnam was full of scars due to the long-term ravages of the colonialists. In the early stage of restoring the factory, the workers could only receive some rice issued by the government, and the materials needed to restore the factory were even more scarce. However, these difficulties could not stop the workers from moving forward. Labor model Nguyen Wen Chun, in order to repair the rotary kiln, took the lead in entering the kiln for repairs despite the high temperature. He often did not go home at night, but stayed in the factory to continue working. In those tense days, no one could say how many examples of "loving the factory as one's home" like Nguyen Wen Chun's there were. In this way, after only two months of fighting, this paralyzed "industrial giant" restored its vitality. This ruthless fact was a crisp slap in the face to the French "prophets".

　　After the factory was repaired, although it still encountered many difficulties in the production process, such as insufficient raw materials and outdated machines, the cement production increased steadily. This year it will produce 370,000 tons of cement for the country, which is a production volume that has never been reached during the rule of the French colonialists.

　　Over the years, the cement plant has won the high honor given by the Party and the country. The People's Government has successively awarded the cement plant the Second and Third Class Labor Medals twice. By 1958, 19 advanced units, 114 labor models, and 1,367 advanced producers had emerged in the factory.

　　Under the care of the Party and the government, the workers not only have guaranteed work, but also their lives are constantly improving. Since the takeover, the government has raised the workers' wages twice, and the wages have almost doubled compared to 1955. The workers' welfare and labor protection have also been given special attention. From 1956 to 1957, the factory spent more than 700 million yuan to improve workers' lives and add welfare facilities; and spent 50 million yuan to strengthen safety equipment. Now, the workers no longer need to live in dark and low thatched cottages. In recent years, the factory has built new residential areas for the workers; clinics, nurseries, and night schools have all opened their doors to the workers and their relatives; a swimming pool for the workers to enjoy is under construction. It is worth mentioning here that during the rule of the French colonialists, 85% of the workers in the factory were illiterate. After liberation, by the end of 1958, all the workers had gotten rid of illiteracy. Speaking of this, the old worker Nguyen Wen Chun said with emotion: "I can read, this is the kindness of the Party!"

　　Now, the enterprise reform of the cement plant has entered the final stage. After the enterprise reform, the workers' class consciousness has been further improved, and their eyes have become brighter. The emulation movement launched by them under the call of the Labor Party has achieved great victories. In the near future, when the expansion project of this factory is completed, its annual output will reach 800,000 tons. People believe that this modern large enterprise, which plays a huge role in Vietnam's socialist construction, will surely move from victory to greater victory.

    我们爱厂如爱家
    ——访问越南民主共和国海防水泥厂
    本报记者　胡本英
    走进越南北方的大企业之——海防水泥厂，我立刻被一片动人的景象所吸引：在扩建厂房的工地上，人声、搅拌机和推土机的轰响声，加上载重汽车的嘶鸣，震耳欲聋。在车间里，“爱国竞赛运动”汹涌澎湃，工人们向党提出了庄严的保证：一定超额完成今年的生产计划，向1959年争夺时间。
    海防水泥厂，这个惨遭法国殖民者沉重破坏的大企业，曾经走过了艰难的恢复阶段，现在，它正焕发着充沛的活力，为越南的社会主义建设事业贡献巨大力量。
    悲惨的历史
    海防水泥厂的六千多名职工，今天在欢庆工厂的新生的时候，还没有忘记它过去的悲惨历史。
    1899年，那时越南已经沦为法国殖民地，以路易·马瑟埃为代表的法国资本家，看上了海防附近的绿石矿（水泥原料）和这里靠海的地理位置，就选择现在的厂址开始建厂。法国资本家依靠殖民军队的刺刀，逼迫这里的农民拆毁房屋，铲平稻田，并在他们倾家荡产的情况下，驱使他们替法国资本家充当苦工。工人们就这样含着眼泪，把这个庞大的工厂建设起来。
    “殖民地的工人，在外国资本家看来，就是会说话的牛马，他们对工人的剥削和无理的侮辱，简直令人发指”，这个厂的行政科长范玉谋同志、一位曾经在战场上同法国强盗战斗过的复员军人，用深沉的语调向记者介绍当时的情况。这个工厂的普通工人，每天要劳动十二、三小时，但一个强壮的男工每天只能赚两毛钱，而女工、童工，虽然和男工做同样的工作，却只能拿到一毛钱和五分钱。这样微薄的工资不用说养家，就是自己每天也只能吃“一干二稀”，勉强维持生命。更可恨的是，法国殖民者和工头还经常任意敲诈勒索和侮辱工人，甚至常常在光天化日之下调戏女工。
    工厂里没有任何劳动保护，工伤事故层出不穷。受伤的工人得不到医治，一旦残废了，就会被抛出工厂大门。过去的老工人，哪一个身上不残留着斑斑伤痕。现在水泥厂看门的老工人阮文顺就是因为受伤而被割掉了一只胳膊。范玉谋的姐姐也曾经在这个工厂当过女工，由于经年用头顶运烧得滚热的泥渣，还在年青的时候，头发就脱光了。
    越南工人的痛苦和血汗喂肥了那些法国老爷们。范玉谋告诉我一个数字：法国资本家投资建厂共用了一百五十万法郎，而1953年的利润就达四亿八千七百九十七万法郎。从建厂到1955年法国人撤退，五十多年中，法国资本家从这个工厂榨取了越南人民多少血汗啊！法国老爷们在他们国内盖起了高楼大厦，在越南避暑胜地建造了别墅，哪一块砖瓦上不散发着血腥味！
    海防水泥厂的历史，实际上就是一部越南人民的血泪史，也是法国殖民者残酷掠夺越南无穷财富的历史见证人！
    不屈不挠的斗争
    但是，越南工人阶级不是任人宰割的羔羊。从1927年起，水泥厂的工人就进行了有组织的斗争。越南革命青年同志会成立后，更直接领导了工人们的战斗。工人们首先喊出了“反打骂、反剋扣工资”的响亮口号，向那些法国资本家的走狗进行斗争。在工人们浩大声势的压力下，走狗们的气焰不得不有所收敛。接着，工人们就把斗争的锋芒转向法国资本家，提出了增加工资的要求。1929年5月1日，是工人们最值得骄傲的日子。这一天，在这座警卫森严的工厂上空，升起了第一面红旗。它向越南人民宣告：在这个印度支那的最大企业里，工人们取得了一次巨大的胜利。
    1930年1月6日，印度支那共产党诞生了。从此，水泥厂的工人在党的领导下，沿着正确的方向，展开了更加英勇的斗争。
    1954年法国殖民主义者在越南人民的沉重打击下，被迫在日内瓦同越南人民的代表签订了日内瓦协议。根据双方协议，法国殖民者要在1955年撤出海防。但是，就在这个时期，法国殖民者阴谋对水泥厂进行彻底的破坏。于是，工人们的一场反破坏斗争就激烈地展开了。
    “水泥厂是越南人民的，不许法国人把它毁掉！”尽管当时法国殖民者在厂里私设牢狱，无理逮捕和拷打工人，但工人们凛然无惧，发出了愤怒的吼声。白天，法国人把拆下来的机器拉出厂去，工人们就尾随在汽车后面，看他们放在什么地方；夜间，工人们就悄悄地把一些重要的机件藏到阴沟里。
    记者访问了这个厂的老工人、劳动模范阮文纯和先进生产者阮文遣。在法国殖民者疯狂破坏工厂的时候，他们曾多次奋不顾身地把能拆下来的机件都藏了起来，当人民政府接管这个工厂以后，他们就立即把那些机件交还给工厂。他们说：“工厂是国家的财产，我们工人坚决用自己的力量保护它”。这是多么质朴和多么豪迈的语言。这种英勇的行动，正是越南工人阶级高贵品质的表现。在这样英雄的人民面前，法国殖民者怎能不遭到可耻的失败。
    一定让它“返老还童”
    法国殖民者把水泥厂大肆破坏之后，在他们夹着尾巴撤退的时候，还趾高气扬地对越南工人说：“你们要想恢复生产，至少也得两年的时间”。但是，这些瞎了眼睛的老爷们的预言像肥皂泡一样破灭了！
    在劳动党发出的加速经济恢复工作的战斗号召下，大批曾经身经百战的复员军人，被派到水泥厂工作。他们像在战场上进行歼灭法国殖民军队的战斗一样，今天在工业战线上，又领导着英勇的工人阶级夺取新的胜利。工人们更是个个斗志昂扬，他们以国家主人翁的姿态，向党宣誓：“一定让水泥厂早日‘返老还童’，为国家建设服务！”
    当时，富饶的越南大地，由于殖民者的长期摧残，疮痍满目。工人们在恢复工厂的初期，只能领到政府发给的一些大米，而恢复工厂所需要的材料更是奇缺。但是，这些困难阻挡不了工人们前进的脚步。劳动模范阮文纯为了修好回转窑，冒着高温带头入窑进行修理。夜晚，他也常常不回家，留在厂里继续干活。在那紧张的日子里，像阮文纯这样“爱厂如爱家”的事例，谁也说不清有多少。就这样，仅仅经过两个月的战斗，这个瘫痪了的“工业巨人”，就恢复了它的活力。这个无情的事实，对于法国“预言家”真是一记清脆的耳光。
    工厂修复以后，尽管它在生产过程中仍然遇到原材料不足、机器陈旧等许多困难，但是，水泥产量却节节上升。今年它将为国家生产三十七万吨水泥，这是法国殖民者统治时期从来没有达到的产量。
    几年来，水泥厂赢得了党和国家所给予的崇高荣誉。人民政府先后两次颁发给水泥厂二级和三级劳动勋章。到1958年为止，全厂涌现了十九个先进单位、一百一十四个劳动模范、一千三百六十七个先进生产者。
    工人们在党和政府的关怀下，不仅工作有了保障，而且生活不断获得改善。从接管到现在，政府两次提高了工人的工资，同1955年相比，工资几乎提高了一倍。工人的福利事业和劳动保护，也得到特别重视。从1956年到1957年，工厂为了改善工人生活和增添福利设施，就支出了七亿多元；为了加强安全设备，支出了五千万元。现在，工人们再也不需要住在阴暗低矮的小茅屋中了。几年来，工厂为工人兴建了新的住宅区；医务所、托儿所、夜校都向工人和他们的亲人敞开了大门；一个供工人享用的游泳池正在建造中。这里值得特别提出的是，法国殖民者统治时期，全厂85％的工人都是文盲。解放后，到1958年底，工人们就全部摆脱了文盲状态。谈到这一点，老工人阮文纯不胜感慨地说：“我能认识字，这是党的恩情啊！”
    现在，水泥厂的企业改革已经进入了最后阶段。经过企业改革，工人们的阶级觉悟进一步提高了，眼睛更加明亮了。他们在劳动党的号召下掀起的竞赛运动，已经取得很大的胜利。不久的将来，当这个厂的扩建工程竣工后，它的年产量将达到八十万吨。人们相信，这座对越南的社会主义建设起着巨大作用的现代化大企业，一定会从胜利走向更大的胜利。
