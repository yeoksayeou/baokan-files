From our Hangzhou dispatch on the 26th: A vigorous new upsurge in short-distance transportation has unfolded across Zhejiang. More than 200,000 people in the province, participating in professional and sideline transportation teams, are using over 27,000 handcarts and over 10,000 tons of civilian boats, bamboo rafts, aerial cableways and chutes to promptly transport large quantities of bamboo, wood, firewood, charcoal, ore and other agricultural and sideline products from rural mines to transportation lines, while also transporting various daily-use industrial goods to the countryside, supporting industrial and agricultural production. Recently, the province's freight volume has been increasing steadily, with October doubling September's volume. In the first ten days of November, 640,000 tons of goods were transported, an increase of over 90% compared to the same period in October.

Since the national broadcast conference on short-distance transportation on October 27, calling for vigorous development of short-distance transportation, people's communes across Zhejiang have launched an even more enthusiastic socialist labor competition. Transportation teams in the Wenzhou Special District, with the goal of transporting 1.5 million tons of goods this year and comprehensively overfulfilling the transportation task, have proposed a linked competition to the Jinhua Special District. To catch up with Wenzhou, all transportation team members in the Jinhua area, from the special district to the county, commune, brigade, and individual, are assigning transportation volume targets layer by layer according to schedule, and are organizing labor competitions between counties, communes, production brigades, and production teams. After the linked competition between Jiande and Tonglu counties, freight volume increased rapidly. Tonglu County completed 99% of its monthly plan in ten days.

During the short-distance transportation campaign, the province is carrying out technical innovation and revolution, vigorously developing water and land transportation construction, and building vehicles and boats, fundamentally improving transportation conditions. Starting in October, more than 30,000 people in 36 counties (cities) including Longquan organized to construct over 60 highways. To date, over 150 kilometers have been completed, connecting mountainous aerial cableways, chutes, and handcart paths, greatly facilitating short-distance transportation. After two days and nights of hard work, Wangyan Commune in Suichang County built 16 dams to raise the water level, ensuring navigation on 55 kilometers of waterways, and doubling transportation efficiency.

In the midst of vigorous short-distance transportation, people's communes across the province are consolidating and strengthening commune-run professional transportation teams. According to preliminary statistics, over 60% of the province's people's communes have established professional transportation teams. This large professional transportation force is skilled in its work, has high transportation efficiency, undertakes the commune's regular transportation tasks, and plays a backbone role in commune transportation. Tianren People's Commune in Jiaxing County rectified and improved its professional transportation team, doubling transportation efficiency without increasing transportation equipment; the labor force was reduced from 1,150 to 668 people, yet it can still complete 20,000 to 30,000 tons of freight per month, ensuring the transportation needs of national and commune industrial and agricultural production. Currently, all parts of the province are further mobilizing the masses to launch an even greater upsurge in transporting agricultural and sideline products.

From our Hefei dispatch on the 26th: Anhui Province is carrying out a vigorous mass short-distance transportation movement. People's communes across the province have established 658 professional transportation teams, organized over 372,000 various types of civilian transportation vehicles such as horse-drawn carts, ox-drawn carts, flatbed carts, and wheelbarrows, and over 23,000 wooden boats, rafts, etc., with over 429,000 people participating in short-distance transportation. Transportation volume is increasing steadily.

In arranging transportation, Anhui prioritizes water transport wherever possible. Land transport takes different forms depending on the characteristics of different regions. For example, cableways and chutes are used for transportation in mountainous areas, carts and boats are used in plain areas, and transportation tracks are implemented within factories and mines, fully exploiting the potential of transportation equipment and reducing labor intensity. Shuangfu People's Commune in Fuyang County uses a network of rivers to carry out short-distance transportation, transporting over 800,000 catties of various materials, as well as a large number of bricks, tiles, and gravel, in five months.

The development of the mass short-distance transportation movement has continuously transported resources that were previously long-term stockpiled in mountainous and remote areas, powerfully promoting industrial and agricultural production. Due to the remote location and transportation difficulties, 200 tons of waste products purchased by the Fujji Production Team of the Lixing People's Commune in Taihe County were stockpiled for three years; the commune's professional transportation team transported it all in two trips.

While carrying out short-distance transportation, various regions have also reformed civilian transportation equipment. The Fuyang Special District is gradually converting horse-drawn carts into four-wheeled trailers and flatbed carts into pedal carts, increasing efficiency and freight volume by more than 150%. This has played a significant role in ensuring the completion of transportation tasks.

    千车万船赶运城乡物资
    浙江短途运输竞赛热火朝天运量猛增90％
    安徽组成六百多个专业队水陆并进搞运输
    本报杭州26日电　一个轰轰烈烈的短途运输新高潮已在浙江各地展开。全省二十多万人参加的专业运输队和副业运输队，运用二万七千多辆手车、一万多吨位的民船、竹筏和索道滑道等工具，及时把农村矿山的大量竹、木、柴、炭、矿石和其他农副产品等物资运到各交通沿线，又把各种日用工业品运往农村，支援了工农业生产。最近以来，全省运量节节上升，10月比9月运量增加两倍，11月上旬运输货物六十四万吨，比10月同期增加90％以上。
    浙江省自10月27日全国短途运输广播大会发出大搞短途运输的号召以后，全省各人民公社开展了更加热烈的社会主义劳动竞赛。温州专区短途运输战线上全体运输队员以在今年内运出一百五十万吨物资、全面超额完成运输任务为条件，向金华专区提出挂钩竞赛。金华地区短途运输战线的全体运输队员为了猛赶温州，从专区到县、到社、到队、到人，按期层层布置运量指标，并组织县、公社、大队、生产队之间展开你追我赶的劳动竞赛。建德、桐庐两县相互挂钩竞赛后，货运量飞跃增长。桐庐县十天完成月计划的99％。
    在短途运输运动中，全省各地开展技术革新和技术革命运动，大搞水陆交通建设，大造车船，从根本上改善交通条件。10月份起，龙泉等三十六个县（市）组织群众三万多人，动工兴建六十多条公路，到目前为止，已完成一百五十多公里，并衔接山区索道、滑道、手车道，大大便利了短途运输。遂昌县王岩公社经过两昼夜奋战，筑成十六条水坝抬高水位，保证五十五公里的河道通航，成倍地提高了运输效率。
    在大搞短途运输中，全省各地人民公社巩固和壮大了社办专业运输队伍。据初步统计，目前全省已有60％以上的人民公社建立了专业运输队。这支庞大的运输专业队伍业务熟练，运输效率高，担负了公社的经常运输任务，并在公社运输中起着骨干作用。嘉兴县天壬人民公社整顿提高专业运输队伍，在不增加运输工具的情况下，提高运输效率一倍；劳动力从原来的一千一百五十人减少到六百六十八人，每月仍能完成二万至三万吨货运任务，保证了国家和公社工农业生产对运输的需要。目前，全省各地正在进一步发动群众，掀起更大的运送农副产品的新高潮。
    本报合肥26日电　安徽省正在开展一个轰轰烈烈的群众性的短途运输运动。全省各地人民公社已建立专业运输队六百五十八个，组织马车、牛车、平板车、独轮车等各种民间运输车辆三十七万二千多辆，木船、簰筏等二万三千多只，参加短途运输的人数达四十二万九千多人。运输量节节上升。
    安徽各地在运输安排上，做到凡是能够利用水运的地方，都利用水运。陆上运输根据不同地区的特点采取了不同的形式。如在山区运输利用索道、溜槽，平原地区实行车子化、船运化，厂矿内部实行运输轨道化，充分发掘运输工具潜力，减轻劳动强度。阜阳县双浮人民公社利用河网化开展短途运输，在五个月的时间内就运出各种物资八十多万斤，以及大批砖瓦和砂石。
    群众性的短途运输运动的开展，已把过去许多长期积压在山区和偏僻地区的物资源源不断运了出来，有力地促进了工农业生产。太和县李兴人民公社付集生产队，过去收购的二百吨废品，由于道路偏僻，运输困难，积压了三年；通过公社建立的专业运输队，两次就运光了。
    各地在开展短途运输的同时，还结合对民间运输工具进行了改革。阜阳专区逐步将马车改为四轮拖带车，平板车改为脚踏车，工效和运量都提高了一倍半以上。对保证完成运输任务起了很大作用。
