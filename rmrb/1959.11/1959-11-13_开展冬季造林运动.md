To launch a winter afforestation campaign

Wood is an important material for socialist construction. Whether it's building factories, opening mines, repairing railways, building cars, building ships, making farm tools, making furniture, or building houses..., none of these can do without wood. The significance of developing forestry production goes far beyond this. Forests can also transform the climate, regulate rainfall, conserve water, soil, and fertilizer, prevent wind, sand, and drought, and ensure stable and increased agricultural production. Therefore, developing forestry production is an extremely important task. Therefore, the revised draft of the National Agricultural Development Program of the Party points out: "Starting from 1956, within twelve years, afforest wasteland and barren mountains within the scope of what natural conditions permit and human resources can manage. In all places next to houses, villages, roads, and water, wherever possible, trees should be planted in a planned way."

In the past few years, forestry production, like industrial and agricultural production, has developed rapidly and achieved great results. In terms of afforestation, by the end of 1958, the country had afforested more than 490 million mu, including more than 188.8 million mu of timber forests, and the rest were protective forests, economic forests, fuel forests, etc. In the first half of this year, the country afforested another 170 million mu, completing 85% of this year's afforestation task. Timber production has also increased year by year. From 1950 to 1958, the country produced a total of more than 169 million cubic meters of logs. Forestry production has its own characteristics. It takes a long time from planting to becoming timber. Precisely because of this, although forestry production has achieved great results, it still lags behind the needs of industrial and agricultural production development. In order to meet the needs of the great development of the national economy and the increasing improvement of people's lives, and to reduce the threat of natural disasters to agricultural production, it is necessary to accelerate the development of forestry production. Only in this way can we change the current situation of insufficient forest resources in our country and support and promote the development of industrial and agricultural production. Accelerating the development of forestry production is not only to meet the needs of industrial and agricultural production and people's lives, but also to realize the gardenization of the land and build our country into an ideal and beautiful large garden with green mountains, clear waters, singing birds, fragrant flowers, fresh air, and pleasant scenery everywhere.

To achieve the above two goals, all localities must make plans for planting trees and afforestation according to different conditions and different needs. Formulating plans should take into account the overall situation and also adapt to local conditions. Taking into account the overall situation means that we must consider the needs of the commune and the needs of national construction; we must consider both immediate interests and long-term interests; we must develop both huge forest bases and small and medium-sized afforestation undertakings; we must be conducive to production and construction, and also conducive to transforming nature and beautifying the land. Adapting to local conditions means determining the focus of afforestation according to the different characteristics of each place. For example, in areas with severe soil erosion, we should choose fast-growing and well-growing tree species for afforestation, and strive to achieve green trees as soon as possible to conserve water and soil; in areas with better natural conditions, we should focus on building timber forests and economic forests, and establish woody oil base, in order to meet the economic construction and people's needs for forests. Afforestation plans should not only be grasped by leaders at all levels, but also be implemented in communes, production teams, and even factories, institutions, and schools, implement a responsibility system, set people and quotas, and divide areas for contracting, covering planting, survival, and tending.

In terms of the national scope and general situation, afforestation should first of all vigorously create timber forests and establish new timber bases. Because the development of timber forests is directly related to the country's industrialization and the fundamental interests of the people of the whole country. At present, the average annual consumption of wood per person in our country is only about 0.08 cubic meters, which is far behind industrialized countries. According to the speed of industrialization in our country, it is estimated that in more than ten years, the average annual consumption of wood per person will reach about 0.5 cubic meters. In this way, several hundred million cubic meters of wood must be produced every year, and millions of hectares of forests need to be felled. These forests must be built from now on; otherwise, it will bring certain difficulties to my country's future industrial construction. Some people once believed that trees grow slowly, and afforestation cannot solve the problem of timber in the short term. Therefore, they are not enthusiastic about creating timber forests. Obviously, this view is incorrect. It is precisely because planting trees is not like planting crops that can be harvested in the same year, but requires a longer growth time to become timber, we should make long-term plans and start early to prepare for the timber problem in the future, and we cannot dig a well only when we are thirsty. Moreover, the view that trees cannot grow faster is also worth studying. Our country has seen large areas of Chinese fir that become timber in eight years, poplar and eucalyptus trees that become timber in seven years, and paulownia trees that become timber in six years. Many forests built in various regions after liberation have now begun to be felled and utilized. The Zhanghe Forest Farm in Cixian County, Hebei Province, planted poplar and black locust forests in 1954. Some of them have been felled this spring to make mine pillars to support coal production. These facts fully demonstrate that as long as effective measures are taken and tending and management are strengthened, the growth period of trees can be shortened. In areas where wood is scarce, it is even more important and urgent to develop timber forests. Most of my country's existing timber forests are located in deep mountains and remote areas, while the places that need the most wood are inland plains. Transporting large amounts of wood over long distances not only greatly increases transportation volume, but also increases wood costs. Last year, the amount of wood transported from the Northeast and Inner Mongolia into the customs accounted for nearly a quarter of the transportation volume on the same route. The pit props transferred from Inner Mongolia to the Datong Coal Mine in Shanxi Province have a transportation distance of more than 2,400 kilometers, and the freight for each cubic meter of wood accounts for more than half of the transfer price. Therefore, all localities must vigorously develop timber forests, establish new timber bases, and strive to achieve self-sufficiency in wood as soon as possible, and supply wood for national construction. When developing timber forests, on the one hand, we must choose fast-growing tree species and strive to become timber as soon as possible, and on the other hand, we must also take into account the diverse needs of national construction for wood varieties, develop various different tree species according to local conditions, and in particular, develop local precious timber tree species. The natural conditions in the south are better, and the forest trees grow rapidly. We should vigorously develop Chinese fir, which grows fast, has good material, and has a high yield of timber, and bamboo forests that can be widely used to replace wood, as well as fast-growing tree species such as Masson pine, eucalyptus, and casuarina; in the north, we should focus on developing fast-growing tree species such as poplar, paulownia, willow, chinaberry, and ailanthus; mining areas should create fast-growing mine pillar forests to solve the supply problem of pit props; in the Northeast, Inner Mongolia, and other existing timber forest areas, while establishing new timber bases, we should actively do a good job in the renewal of forest felling, cut one and create two, so that the renewal keeps up with the felling, so that the existing forest base can continuously supply timber.

While vigorously developing timber forests and establishing timber bases, we should also pay attention to the development of economic forests (especially woody oil forests), protection forests (water and soil conservation forests, sand control forests and coastal defense forests) and fuel forests to meet various different needs. Oil tea, walnuts, etc. are woody oil materials that are easy to manage, have high quality, and do not occupy cultivated land, and can be planted in large quantities in mountains and hilly areas. Sapium sebiferum, tung oil, lacquer, etc. are important raw materials for industrial oil, and also need to be vigorously developed. All areas suitable for planting should make appropriate arrangements and actively establish various woody oil material bases, cultivate more oil tea mountains, walnut mountains, Sapium sebiferum mountains, tung oil mountains..., and strive to realize the woodyization of most oil materials as soon as possible to meet the needs of national construction and people's lives for oil materials. In order to ensure high yields and bumper harvests in agriculture, in areas with soil erosion and wind and sand hazards, protection forests should continue to be built in accordance with the principle of disaster prevention. Burning firewood is an indispensable living material for the daily life of the vast number of people. In cities and villages lacking fuel, a certain amount of fuel forests should be created to save coal and support national industrial construction.

Just like in water conservancy construction, disaster resistance, fertilizer accumulation, and deep plowing, the people's communes have displayed unparalleled power in afforestation, opening up a broad road for afforestation. Because the people's communes have a wide scope of operation and a large organizational scale, they implement unified leadership and overall planning in developing production, can rationally use land, human resources, and material resources, and can better solve the contradictions between agriculture and forestry competing for land, seasons, and human resources that agricultural cooperatives could not solve in the past, thus greatly promoting the development of industry, agriculture, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery, and also promoting the great development of forestry. Because the people's communes have many people and great strength, and abundant material resources, they have a strong force to fight against nature. During the afforestation season, they can concentrate more manpower, organize large-scale mass shock movements, and concentrate on eliminating large areas of barren mountains and wasteland. At the same time, after communization, many communes and production teams have established commune-run forest farms and forestry professional teams, which closely combine the seasonal large-scale mass shock afforestation movement with the long-term operation of forestry professional teams. All of these provide a reliable guarantee for greatly accelerating the speed of greening, ensuring the quality of afforestation, rapidly establishing forest bases, and continuously improving the technical level of forestry management. In the afforestation movement this spring, it was precisely because all localities gave full play to these favorable conditions of the people's communes that great achievements were achieved. For example, Jianping County in Liaoning Province has seen four "20,000 mu forest communes", five "30,000 mu forest communes", one "40,000 mu forest commune", and one "50,000 mu forest commune". Rui'an County in Zhejiang Province organized 1.89 million people in a few days, shock-afforesting more than 1.02 million mu, and the quality was very good, becoming the first million-mu forest county in the province; the Lichang People's Commune in Chun'an County of this province mobilized 85% of the commune members at once, shock-afforesting more than 130,000 mu in four days. These facts fully demonstrate the great role of the people's communes in afforestation. Now, the season for winter afforestation has come, and all localities need to continue to give play to the superiority of the people's communes and play another triumphant song in the afforestation cause!

To launch a winter afforestation campaign, the masses in some areas may not be very accustomed to it, because in the past, afforestation was generally carried out in spring and rarely in winter. In fact, winter is also a good season for afforestation. In terms of natural conditions, there is more rainfall in autumn, so the soil moisture in winter is relatively sufficient. At the same time, winter is the dormant period for trees. Afforestation during this period will not harm the trees themselves. The conditions for winter afforestation in the south are even better. The climate is warm during this period and is suitable for afforestation. For example, the survival rate of Chinese fir forests built in winter in the Damiao Mountain Miao Autonomous County in Guangxi is as high as 90% or more. In the north, it is generally suitable for afforestation before freezing; however, it is not that afforestation cannot be carried out after freezing. For example, in Inner Mongolia, where the temperature is as low as about minus 30 degrees Celsius, in the Great Leap Forward of 1958, the frozen soil layer was dug to carry out winter afforestation. In just eighteen days, more than 1.233 million mu of forests were built; Baichengzi in Jilin also broke with convention last year and successfully broke through the frozen soil for afforestation. This is because, in winter, the concentration of tree sap is high and the flow is very slow. The tree trunks, branches, and winter buds store a large amount of nutrients, which is very beneficial for rooting and germination, and the trees are easy to survive. Therefore, in areas where the masses are not yet accustomed to winter afforestation, as long as the masses are told clearly about the benefits of winter afforestation, the scientific basis for winter afforestation, and the specific examples of winter afforestation survival, the masses will actively take action. Winter afforestation is not only very favorable in natural conditions, but also more guaranteed in terms of manpower. After the busy "three autumns" work is over, the commune can allocate more manpower to invest in tree planting and afforestation.

The party committees in all localities should seize the opportunity, comprehensively and properly arrange labor, and while doing a good job in winter production, launch a winter afforestation shock movement, and strive to overfulfill this year's afforestation task in a greater, faster, better and more economical way!

    开展冬季造林运动
    木材是社会主义建设的一项重要物资。无论是建工厂，开矿山，修铁路，造车，造船，做农具，制家具，造房子……，哪一样都离不了木材。发展林业生产的意义还远不止此，森林还能改造气候、调节雨量，保水、保土、保肥，防风、防沙、防旱，保证农业稳定增产。因此发展林业生产，是一项极其重要的任务。所以，党的全国农业发展纲要修正草案中指出：“从1956年起，在十二年内，在自然条件许可和人力可能经营的范围内，绿化荒地荒山。在一切宅旁、村旁、路旁、水旁，只要是可能的，都要有计划地种起树来。”
    几年来，林业生产也像工农业生产一样，有着飞跃的发展，取得了很大的成绩。在造林方面，到1958年底，全国共造林四亿九千多万亩，其中有用材林一亿八千八百多万亩，其他是防护林、经济林、薪炭林等。今年上半年，全国又造林一亿七千万亩，完成了今年全年造林任务的85％。木材生产也是年年增产，从1950年到1958年，全国共生产了原木一亿六千九百多万立方米。林业生产有着自己的特点，从种植到成材，需要较长的时间，正因为如此，林业生产虽然已经获得了很大成绩，但是仍然落在工农业生产发展需要的后边。为了适应国民经济大发展和人民生活日益提高的需要，和减免自然灾害对农业生产的威胁，必须加速地发展林业生产。只有这样，才能改变我国森林资源不足的现状，支持和促进工农业生产的发展。加速地发展林业生产，不仅是为了满足工农业生产和人民生活的需要，同时，也是为了实现大地园林化，把我国建设成为一个处处山青水秀、鸟语花香、空气清新、风景宜人的理想的美好的大花园。
    要达到上述两个目的，各地必须根据不同条件和不同需要，对植树造林作出规划。制定规划要从全局着眼，也要因地制宜。从全局着眼，就是说，既要照顾到公社的需要，也要照顾到国家建设的需要；既要照顾眼前利益，也要照顾长远利益；既要发展巨大的森林基地，又要发展中小型的造林事业；既要有利于生产建设，又要有利于改造自然，美化大地。因地制宜，就是要根据各地不同的特点确定造林重点。例如在水土流失严重的地区，就要选择生长得快、生长得好的树种造林，尽量争取早日绿树成荫，以保持住水土；在自然条件较好的地区，就要着重营造用材林、经济林，建立木本油料基地，以满足经济建设和人民生活对森林的需要。造林规划不但各级领导上要掌握，而且应当落实到公社、生产队以至工厂、机关、学校，实行责任制，定人定量，划片包干，包种植、包成活、包抚育。
    就全国范围和一般情况来说，造林，首先应该大力营造用材林，建立新的用材基地。因为发展用材林直接关系到国家的工业化和全国人民的根本利益。目前我国平均每人每年只消费木材约零点零八立方米，大大落后于工业发达的国家。根据我国工业化发展的速度，预计十几年后平均每人每年消费木材将达零点五立方米左右，这样，每年必须生产几亿立方米木材，需要砍伐森林几百万公顷。这些森林必须从现在起就开始营造；否则将会给我国以后的工业建设带来一定的困难。曾有人认为树木生长缓慢，造林在短期内不能解决用材的问题，因此，对营造用材林不热心。显然，这种看法是不正确的。正是因为种树不像种庄稼一样当年就可收获，而是需要较长的生长时间才能成材，我们就更应该作长远打算，及早动手，为以后的用材问题而未雨绸缪，不能临渴才去掘井。而且，认为树木不能较快地生长的看法，也还值得研究。我国已经出现过大面积八年成材的杉木，七年成材的杨树、桉树，六年成材的泡桐等速生丰产林。许多地区在解放后营造的树林，现在已经开始采伐利用。河北省磁县漳河林场，1954年造的杨树、洋槐林，今春已经有一部分采伐用来做矿柱，支援了煤炭生产。这些事实充分说明：只要采取有效的措施，加强抚育管理，树木的成长期是可以缩短的。在木材缺乏的地区，发展用材林，更加重要和迫切。我国现有的成材森林，大部分处在深山和边远地区，而需要木材最多的却是平原内地。大量木材远道运输，不仅大大增加了交通运输量，而且提高了木材成本。去年从东北、内蒙古进关的木材运输量，占同一线路运输量的近四分之一。由内蒙古调给山西大同煤矿的坑木，运程长达二千四百多公里，每立方米木材的运费，占调拨价的一半以上。因此，各地必须大力发展用材林，建立新的用材基地，力求早日达到木材自给，并供应国家建设用材。在发展用材林的时候，一方面固然要选用速生树种，力争早日成材，另一方面也要照顾到国家建设对木材品种的多方面的需要，因地制宜地发展各种不同的树种，特别是要发展当地的珍贵的用材树种。南方自然条件较好，林木生长迅速，应大力发展生长快、材质好、出材量高的杉木和可以广泛代替木材使用的竹林，以及马尾松、桉、木麻黄等速生树种；北方应着重发展杨树、泡桐、柳树、苦楝、臭椿等速生树种；矿区应当营造速生的矿柱林，以解决坑木的供应问题；东北、内蒙古和其他现有成材林区，应在建立新的用材基地的同时，积极作好林木采伐的更新工作，砍一造二，使更新跟上采伐，以便使现有森林基地永续不断地供应木材。
    在大力发展用材林、建立用材基地的时候，还应当注意发展经济林（特别是木本油料林）、防护林
  （水土保持林、治沙林和海防林）和薪炭林，以满足各种不同的需要。油茶、核桃等是管理省工、质量高、又不占用耕地的木本油料，可以在山上、丘陵地区大量种植。乌桕、油桐、漆等是重要的工业用油原料，也需要大力发展。凡是适于种植的地区，都应当作适当安排，积极建立各种木本油料基地，培植更多的油茶山、核桃山、乌桕山、油桐山……，争取早日实现大部分油料木本化，以满足国家建设和人民生活对油料的需要。为了保障农业高产丰收，在水土冲刷和有风沙危害的地区，都应当根据因灾害设防的方针，继续营造防护林。烧柴，是广大人民日常生活中不可缺少的生活资料，在缺乏燃料的城市和乡村，应营造一定数量的薪炭林，以节约煤炭支援国家工业建设。
    正像在兴修水利、抗御灾害、积肥、深翻等方面显示了无比的威力一样，人民公社在造林事业上也显示了无比的威力，为造林事业开辟了广阔的道路。由于人民公社经营范围广、组织规模大，在发展生产上实行统一领导、全面规划，能够合理利用土地、人力和物力，可以更好地解决过去农业合作社所不能解决的农业和林业争地、争季节、争人力的矛盾，因而大大促进了工、农、牧、副、渔业的发展，也促进了林业的大发展。由于人民公社人多力量大、物力雄厚，具有向大自然作斗争的强大力量，在造林季节可以集中比较多的人力，组织大规模的群众性的突击运动，集中成片地消灭大面积的荒山荒地。同时，公社化后，许多公社和生产队都建立了社办林场和林业专业队，使季节性大规模的群众突击造林运动和林业专业队的长年经营密切结合起来。所有这些，都为大大加快绿化速度，保证造林质量，迅速建立森林基地和不断提高经营林业的技术水平，提供了可靠的保证。在今年春季的造林运动中，正是由于各地充分发挥了人民公社这些有利条件，因而取得了很大的成绩。如辽宁建平县就出现了四个“两万亩林社”、五个“三万亩林社”、一个“四万亩林社”、一个“五万亩林社”。浙江瑞安县几天之内组织了一百八十九万人次，突击造林一百零二万余亩，而且质量很好，成为全省第一个百万亩林县；这个省的淳安县里商人民公社，一下子就发动了85％的社员，突击四天，造林十三万余亩。这些事实，充分显示了人民公社在造林事业上的巨大作用。现在，冬季造林的季节已经来到，各地需要继续发挥人民公社的优越性，在造林事业上再奏一曲凯歌！
    开展冬季造林运动，可能有些地区的群众不大习惯，因为过去一般都是在春季造林而很少在冬季造林。其实，冬季也是造林的良好季节。以自然条件来说，秋季雨水较多，因此冬季的土壤水份比较充足，同时，冬季又是树木的休眠期，在这时期造林，树木本身不会受到损害。南方冬季造林条件更好，这一时期气候温暖，适于造林。如广西大苗山苗族自治县在冬季营造的杉木林，成活率高达90％以上。北方一般在封冻前宜于造林；但是也并不是封冻以后就不能造林。例如气温低至摄氏零下三十度左右的内蒙古地区，在大跃进的1958年，就曾挖开冻土层进行冬季造林，仅仅十八天的工夫，就造林一百二十三万三千多亩；吉林的白城子，去年也打破常规，破开冻土造林，获得成功。这是因为，冬天树液浓度大，流动很慢，树干、树条和冬芽里保存着大量的养分，对生根发芽有很大好处，树木容易成活。所以，在群众尚不习惯冬季造林的地区，只要向群众讲清楚冬季造林的好处、冬季造林的科学根据和冬季造林成活的具体事例，群众就会积极行动起来的。冬季造林，不仅自然条件很有利，而且在人力上也更有保证。繁忙的“三秋”工作过去之后，公社就可以抽出较多的人力投入植树造林工作。
    各地党委应当紧紧把握时机，全面地、妥善地安排劳力，在做好冬季生产工作的同时，开展一个冬季造林突击运动，为力争又多又快又好又省地超额完成今年全年的造林任务而奋斗！
