    Li Meiqiong – Helping the Masses Manage Their Households Frugally
    Li Meiqiong is a resident savings canvasser at the Nanjing Road branch of the People's Bank of China in the Jiang'an District of Wuhan. She understands that savings are an important task that helps people arrange their lives well and accumulates construction funds for the country. She works very hard and has made great achievements.
    To do a good job in resident savings, the first thing is to be enthusiastic in serving the residents. Li Meiqiong has always regarded the residents' work as her own, offering ideas to the residents' committee, participating in residents' fertilizer accumulation, assessing rent, and mobilizing the masses to carry out street sanitation, doing a lot of work for the residents. On the second day after the heavy rain on June 8th, some residents' houses were flooded, so she went barefoot to help drain the water. The residents all treat her as a relative, so the savings work has also been done well.
    The six residents' committees she is in contact with have accumulated more than 68,000 yuan in savings from January to September this year, and the amount of savings in September increased by more than 77% compared with the same period last year.
    In the Great Leap Forward year of 1958, Li Meiqiong assisted the street in establishing a resident "service station," which was deeply welcomed by the masses. The savings business has also developed rapidly. For example, the Changye Lane service station has opened 225 new savings accounts. Small savings have increased from more than 2,000 yuan to 3,800 yuan per month. Current savings collect more than 6,000 yuan per month, and term savings have taken in more than 3,100 yuan.

    李美琼——帮助群众勤俭持家
    李美琼是武汉市江岸区南京路人民银行的居民储蓄外勤。她了解到储蓄是帮助人民安排好生活，为国家积累建设资金的一项重要工作，工作非常努力，作出了很大成绩。
    作好居民储蓄工作，首先要热心为居民服务。李美琼一直就把居民工作当为自己的工作看待，协助居民委员会出主意，参加居民积肥，评定房租，挨户发动群众搞街道卫生，为居民做了许多工作。6月8日下大雨的第二天，有些住户房屋积水，她就打起赤脚帮助排渍。居民都把她当作亲人，因此储蓄工作也作好了。
    她联系的六个居民委员会，今年1至9月累计收储六万八千多元，9月份收储数比去年同期增长了77％以上。
    在大跃进的1958年，李美琼协助街道成立了居民“服务站”，深受群众欢迎。储蓄业务也得到迅速发展。如昌业里服务站已经新开了二百二十五个储蓄户头，小额储蓄每月由二千多元增加到三千八百元，活期储蓄每月收六千多元，定期储蓄已收进三千一百多元。
