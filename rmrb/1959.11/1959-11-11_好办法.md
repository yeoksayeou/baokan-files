For us, there is no more valuable asset than labor power. With people and an ample labor force, we can develop our socialist construction cause more rapidly.

Over the past year, people's communes in various regions have adopted many methods to solve the labor shortage problem during the Great Leap Forward: improving labor organization, implementing responsibility systems to enable everyone to play a better role in large-scale collective labor; carrying out mass tool reform movements, improving backward and inefficient old-style farm tools, creating efficient new-style farm tools, and even adopting some agricultural machinery to increase labor efficiency, turning one person into two or three. These methods are all very good and have achieved great results.

Now, the Kongtong People's Commune in Pingliang City, Gansu, has come up with a new method: reforming old and unreasonable production procedures to rationalize the production process. The facts of this commune have fully proven that this is another important way to save labor, improve labor efficiency, and solve the contradiction of labor shortage.

Reforming unreasonable phenomena in production and rationalizing the production process is a good experience and a good method with universal significance that should be widely promoted. At present, most of the agricultural production procedures and production methods in our vast rural areas are left over from before communization, or even before cooperativization, and many are no longer suitable for the needs of production development after communization. For example, although transporting mud for composting from far away to the village, and then transporting fertilizer mixed with a large amount of soil from the village to the fields, is far less cost-effective than building pig and sheep pens next to the fields and applying fertilizer on the spot, it is quite common in vast rural areas; for example, winding field roads, "enclave lands" and "interspersed lands," etc., although not as convenient as rationally distributed roads, which take up less arable land, and although not as labor-saving as working nearby, still exist in many places. As long as such unreasonable phenomena in production are reformed, a large amount of labor can be saved. In the era of individual economy, it was impossible to reform such unreasonable phenomena in production; after cooperativization, some reforms were carried out, but due to the small organizational scale, reforms could not be carried out on a more rational basis. Now that we are communized, we are fully capable of thoroughly reforming these unreasonable phenomena.

Reforming unreasonable phenomena in production and rationalizing the production process is also a good experience and a good method that is both economical and highly effective. According to the experience of the Tuanjie Production Team, many reforms can be achieved without any investment at all, and although some reforms require some investment, the amount is very small, but the benefits obtained are very large. For example, they used very little labor and spent a few days digging nine cave dwellings on the mountain, driving the team's 250 sheep and 24 cattle up the mountain and raising them in the cave dwellings. They have accumulated more than 4 million catties of fertilizer, which can be used for 1,000 mu of mountain land. This one reform alone can save 10,000 man-days of labor for transporting fertilizer up the mountain and 20,000 animal-days. For a production team, this is a huge number, and this is only one of their nine reforms.

It is not difficult to realize the rationalization of the production process. After communization, with the improvement of the degree of collectivization and the expansion of the scale of production, people's horizons have become wider and their thinking has been improved. As long as we are good at inspiring and relying on the masses like the Party organization of the Tuanjie Production Team, we will be able to implement and promote this experience well and make the production methods and production processes of our own commune and team more rational.

    好办法
    对于我们说来，再没有比劳动力更宝贵的财富了。有了人，有了充裕的劳动力，就能使我们的社会主义建设事业更迅速地发展起来。
    一年来各地人民公社采取了很多办法，解决大跃进中劳动力不足的问题：改善劳动组织，贯彻责任制，使每一个人都能在大规模的集体劳动中更好地发挥作用；开展群众性的工具改革运动，把落后的、效率很低的旧式农具进行改良，创造效率高的新式农具，甚至采用部分农业机器，以提高劳动效率，使一个人变成两个人、三个人。这些办法都很好，都收到了很大的效果。
    现在，甘肃平凉市崆峒人民公社又想出了一个新办法：改革旧的不合理的生产程序，使生产过程合理化。这个公社的事实已经完全证明，这是节省劳动力，提高劳动效率，解决劳动力不足矛盾的又一个重要的途径。
    改革生产上的不合理现象，使生产过程合理化是一个有普遍意义，应该普遍推广的好经验，好办法。现在，我们广大农村的农业生产程序，生产方法大都是公社化以前，甚至合作化以前遗留下来的，有很多已经不适合公社化以后的生产发展需要了。比如：把沤肥造肥的泥土从老远的地方运到村里来，而后又把混合了大量土质的肥料从村里运到田里这件事，虽然远不如把猪、羊圈建在田边地旁，就地积肥就地施肥来得更合算些，但却相当普遍地在广大农村存在着；比如弯弯曲曲的田间道路，比如“飞地”和“插花地”等等，虽然远不如合理分布的道路走起来方便，少占很多耕地，虽然不如就近耕作省工省力，但也还有不少地方存在着。只要把诸如此类的生产上的不合理现象加以改革，就能够节省出大量的劳动力。个体经济时代，对这种生产上的不合理现象不可能进行改革；合作化以后，改革了一些，但由于组织规模小，改革不能在更合理的基础上进行。现在，公社化了，我们已经完全有条件彻底改革这些不合理现象了。
    改革生产上的不合理现象，使生产过程合理化，还是一个又经济又收效大的好经验、好办法。根据团结生产队的经验，有许多改革是根本不需要任何的投资就能实现的，有些改革虽然需要一些投资，数量也很少，但所得的利益却是很大。比如他们用了很少的劳动力，几天工夫在山上挖了九孔窑洞，把队的二百五十只羊和二十四头牛赶上山，在窑洞里饲养，已经积肥四百多万斤，可供一千亩山地施用，只这一项改革，就可以节省运肥上山的人工一万个，畜工两万个。对一个生产队来说，这是一个多么巨大的数字，而这只是他们的九项改革中的一项。
    实现生产过程合理化并不难。公社化以后，随着集体化程度的提高和生产规模的扩大，人们的眼界是更开阔了，思想是更提高了。只要像团结生产队党组织那样，善于启发群众和依靠群众，就会把这个经验很好地实行和推广开来，使本社本队的生产方法生产过程更加合理化。
