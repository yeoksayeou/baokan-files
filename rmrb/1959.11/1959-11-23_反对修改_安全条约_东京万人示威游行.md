Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, November 21st: 10,000 workers, students, and citizens in Tokyo held rallies in five locations today, demanding that the government abandon its plan to revise the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

    Participating in these rallies were farmers from areas neighboring Tokyo, striking coal miners from Kyushu and Hokkaido, and unemployed workers from Fukuoka. One of the five rallies was a women's convention, attended by approximately two thousand female workers, housewives, and their children.

    All of these rallies passed resolutions demanding that the Kishi government halt negotiations on revising the "Security Treaty."

    The resolution passed at the rally in western Tokyo stated that the time had come for the Japanese people to rise up and wage a decisive struggle against the Nobusuke Kishi government. The resolution called on Tokyo citizens to participate in the general strike on November 27th and to participate in a mass petition to the Diet. The resolution stated that this action was needed to prevent the government's plan to revise the "Security Treaty" and to overthrow the Nobusuke Kishi government.

    At all the rallies, representatives of the Socialist Party and the Communist Party stated that their parties were determined to fight against the revision of the "Security Treaty." Representatives of the miners reported on their struggle against layoffs and said they would hold strikes to defeat the attempt to revise the "Security Treaty." Their words were met with a storm of enthusiastic applause from the entire audience.

    Participants in the rallies held banners and marched in demonstrations despite the rain. The banners read: "Oppose the revision of the Security Treaty," "Oppose paying war reparations to South Vietnam," "Use the funds earmarked for manufacturing Lockheed-style aircraft to aid typhoon victims," "Down with the Nobusuke Kishi government."

    新华社21日讯　东京消息：东京工人、学生和市民一万人今天在五个地方举行集会，要求政府放弃修改日美“安全条约”的计划。

    在所有的集会上，社会党和共产党的代表表示他们的党决心为反对修改“安全条约”而斗争。矿工代表在会上报告他们进行反解雇斗争的情况，并且说他们将举行罢工来击败修改“安全条约”的企图。他们的话博得全场暴风雨般的热烈欢迎。
    参加集会的人举着标语牌，冒雨举行了示威游行。标语牌上写着：“反对修改安全条约”，“反对向南越支付战争赔偿”，“把预定制造洛克希德式飞机的款项救济台风受灾者”，“打倒岸信介政府”。
