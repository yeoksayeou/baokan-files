Deepening into Communes to Develop Milk Sources

Doing a good job of organizing milk sources is key to guaranteeing the fulfillment and over-fulfillment of plans. This year, the dairy factories along the railway line in Hulunbuir League felt that the milk supply could not meet the needs of increased production. At the beginning of the year, some people in our factory believed that it was necessary to cut back on tasks. In response to this idea, the Party branch mobilized employees to speak out freely, post big-character posters, and debate. After unifying our thinking, the secretary and factory director took the lead and organized forces to go deep into the people's communes to carry out extensive publicity and organizational work. For example, we organized dairy product exhibitions, convened production team leader meetings and dairy farmer meetings through the commune leadership, and conducted door-to-door visits for extensive publicity. Finally, we conducted pilot projects, using points to drive the overall situation, assigning responsibilities to specific individuals, and helping the people's communes build three pastures, teaching the feeders management methods and milking methods, establishing management systems, and solving problems such as feed. These efforts were warmly welcomed by the commune's dairy farmers.

Opening up new milk sources, expanding the milk collection area, collecting milk whenever it is available, and accumulating small amounts into large quantities. In order to increase milk sources, the factory also sent people deep into agricultural and pastoral areas to add two semi-finished product processing points. In order to solve the various difficulties existing in transportation and ensure the timely completion of transportation tasks, the factory widely utilized the transportation capacity of the masses. We used large carts for long distances and large quantities, bicycles for short distances and small quantities, and human back-carrying and shoulder-pole carrying where vehicles could not travel. Because we relied on the masses inside and outside the factory and actively sought solutions, the factory's milk collection volume from January to August increased by 34.25% compared with the same period last year, guaranteeing the over-fulfillment of the production plan.

    深入公社辟乳源
    搞好乳源组织工作是保证完成和超额完成计划的关键。今年呼盟铁路沿线的乳品工厂，都感到奶源供应不能满足增产的需要。年初，我厂有的人认为必须削减任务。党支部针对这种思想发动职工大鸣大放、贴大字报、辩论。在统一思想认识后，由书记、厂长挂帅，组织力量深入各人民公社，广泛开展宣传和组织工作。如组织乳制品展览，通过公社领导召开生产队长会议、奶户会议，挨户访问，广泛进行宣传。最后搞试点，以点带面，分工蹲点包干，帮助人民公社建了三个牧场，教给饲养员管理方法、挤奶方法，建立管理制度和解决饲料等问题，受到公社奶户的热情欢迎。
    开辟新乳源，扩大收乳面积，有奶就收，由少积多。为了增加乳源，工厂又派人深入农牧区，增设两处半成品加工点。为了解决运输上存在的种种困难，保证运输任务的按时完成，工厂就广泛利用群众的运输力，路远数量多的用大车，近处数量少的用自行车，无法行车的就利用人背抬挑。由于我们依靠厂内外群众，积极想办法，1—8月工厂的收奶量比去年同期增长了34.25％，保证了超额完成生产计划。（内蒙呼伦贝尔盟札兰屯乳品工厂代表韩云福）
