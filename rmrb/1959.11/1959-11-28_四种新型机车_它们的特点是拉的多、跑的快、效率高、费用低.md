Four New Types of Locomotives

Their characteristics are pulling more, running faster, higher efficiency, and lower costs.

China has recently successfully trial-produced four electric locomotives and diesel locomotives. These four locomotives are the "Shaoshan Type" electric locomotive, the "Satellite Type" hydraulic transmission diesel locomotive, the "Giant Dragon Type" electric transmission diesel locomotive, and the "Pioneer Type" electric transmission diesel locomotive. Among them, two are freight locomotives and two are passenger locomotives. These four new locomotives have recently been transported from the manufacturing factories to Beijing for exhibition.

According to traction operation tests, the common advantages of these four locomotives are that they pull more, run faster, have higher efficiency, and lower costs.

The successful trial production of these four locomotives is the result of the mass movement and communist collaboration carried out by relevant units under the inspiration of the Party's General Line since the Great Leap Forward in 1958. The "Shaoshan Type" and "Giant Dragon Type" locomotives were trial-produced jointly by more than 40 factories and some scientific research units and schools. The diesel engines of the "Satellite Type" and "Pioneer Type" locomotives were produced in collaboration by the Shanghai and Wuxi diesel engine factories and more than a dozen other factories.

Electric locomotives and diesel locomotives are superior to steam locomotives. With the development of China's railway transportation, the use of electric locomotives and diesel locomotives has become a new subject in railway transportation work. The Baoji-Fengxian section of China's first electrified railway under construction—the Baoji-Chengdu Railway—and the electrified railways of some large mines all require electric locomotives. The Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway passes through a waterless area, the Guiyang-Kunming Railway has tunnels as long as more than 4,000 meters, and there are many tunnels on the Fengtai-Shacheng Railway; these lines all require diesel locomotive traction.

"Shaoshan Type" Electric Locomotive

Compared with the steam locomotives currently used on China's railways, the former can pull more than twice as much cargo as the latter, and the metal required per horsepower is reduced by about half. The design speed of this locomotive is 100 kilometers per hour. It was trial-produced jointly by Xiangtan Electric Machinery Factory and Zhuzhou Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory, etc., with the help of Soviet experts.

"Satellite Type" Hydraulic Transmission Diesel Locomotive

This locomotive was successfully trial-produced by Sifang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory. This locomotive adopts a 1,000-horsepower hydraulic transmission device. Compared with the electric transmission diesel locomotive, the weight of each locomotive can be reduced by 25%–30%, and four to five tons of copper can be saved per thousand horsepower, and the manufacturing cost is about 30% lower.

"Giant Dragon Type" Electric Transmission Diesel Locomotive

This locomotive was designed and trial-produced by Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory. Its thermal efficiency can reach 28%, which is four times higher than the steam locomotives currently in use; its design speed is 100 kilometers per hour.

"Pioneer Type" Electric Transmission Diesel Locomotive

This locomotive was successfully trial-produced by Qishuyan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory and has undergone five traction tests; when it pulls ten passenger cars, the driving speed is 96.2 kilometers per hour. (Attached picture)

    四种新型机车
    它们的特点是拉的多、跑的快、效率高、费用低
    我国最近试制成功了四台电动机车和内燃机车。这四台机车是：“韶山型”电力机车，“卫星型”液力传动内燃机车，“巨龙型”电传动内燃机车和“先行型”电传动内燃机车。其中两台是货运机车，两台是客运机车。这四台新型机车最近已先后从制造工厂运来北京展览。
    根据牵引运行试验，这四台机车的共同优点是拉的多，跑的快，效率高，费用低。
    这四台机车试制成功，是1958年大跃进以来，有关单位在党的总路线的鼓舞下，大搞群众运动和大搞共产主义协作的成果。“韶山型”和“巨龙型”机车，都是由四十多个工厂和一些科学研究单位、学校共同努力试制成功的。“卫星型”和“先行型”机车的内燃机，是由上海、无锡两个柴油机厂和其他十几个工厂协作生产出来的。
    电力机车和内燃机车，比蒸汽机车优越。随着我国铁路运输事业的发展，使用电力机车和内燃机车已经成为铁路运输工作中的一个新课题。修建中的我国第一条电气化铁路——宝成铁路的宝（鸡）凤（县）段和一些大型矿山的电气化铁路，都需要电力机车。兰新铁路穿过一段无水地区，川黔铁路线上有长达四千多米的隧道，丰（台）沙（城）铁路线上隧道很多；这些线路都需要内燃机车牵引。
    “韶山型”电力机车
    这种机车同我国铁路上现在使用的蒸汽机车比较，前者比后者能多拉二倍以上的货物，平均每匹马力所需要的金属约节省一半。这种机车的设计速度为每小时一百公里，它是湘潭电机厂和株洲机车车辆工厂等厂共同协作，并且在苏联专家的帮助下试制成功的。“卫星型”液力传动内燃机车
    这种机车是四方机车车辆工厂试制成功的，这种机车采用了一千匹马力的液力传动装置，与电传动的内燃机车相比，每台机车的重量可减少25％—30％，每千匹马力可节约铜四—五吨，制造成本约低30％。
    “巨龙型”电传动内燃机车
    这种机车是大连机车车辆工厂设计试制成功的。它的热效率可达28％，比现在使用的蒸汽机车高四倍；它的设计速度为每小时一百公里。
  “先行型”电传动内燃机车
    这种机车是戚墅堰机车车辆工厂试制成功的，已经过五次牵引试验；它牵引十辆客车时，每小时行车速度为九十六点二公里。（附图片）
