Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 27th. According to TASS, Moscow, November 27th, the Soviet "Pravda" published an article by Kolionov, commenting on former U.S. Secretary of State Acheson's speech at the Washington meeting of North Atlantic Treaty Organization parliamentarians.

    The author analyzed this speech in detail. He wrote: No matter how Acheson plays with the word peace, he still cannot hide his main attempt—to revive the "brinkmanship."

    Kolionov then recounted Khrushchev's Soviet peace plan proposed at the United Nations, and emphasized that this peace plan aroused enthusiastic response from various countries. The author wrote: Acheson pretends that this simply didn't happen. Acheson is even afraid of the concept of "negotiation."

    Acheson stubbornly said that negotiation is a trap; the "cunning" communists want to lure the "inexperienced" United States into this trap. Acheson threatened the Europeans that the proposal to turn Europe into a peace zone, which is the aim of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, would cause the United States to withdraw from Europe. What particularly annoyed him was that the Europeans themselves were not worried about this issue. However, it should be known that millions of people in Europe do not feel any "Soviet threat" at all.

    Kolionov went on to say that Acheson was so insane as to clamor that even if America's European allies demanded the withdrawal of American troops from Europe, it would be incorrect to agree to such a request. This is the true face of the "protector" of Western European countries. Acheson only confirmed one point: the hypocritical clamor of guaranteeing the security of European countries is nothing more than an attempt to conceal the ambition of certain groups across the ocean to continue to maintain their domination over these countries.

    Kolionov then wrote that Acheson concocted some untenable reasons to defend the current abnormal situation in West Berlin, which is fraught with great danger. What Acheson and his ilk need is a spark secretly in West Berlin so that they can add fuel to the fire at any time and create a raging fire.

    苏联“真理报”发表评论指出
    艾奇逊企图复活“战争边缘政策”
    新华社27日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科27日讯：苏联“真理报”发表了科里奥诺夫的一篇文章，评论前美国国务卿艾奇逊在北大西洋公约组织华盛顿议员会议上的演说。
    作者详细分析了这篇演说。他写道：无论艾奇逊怎样玩弄和平这个字眼，他仍旧掩盖不住他的主要企图——复活“战争边缘政策”。
    科里奥诺夫接着追述了赫鲁晓夫在联合国提出的苏联的和平计划，并着重指出这个和平计划引起了各国的热烈响应。作者写道：艾奇逊却假装说，根本没有这回事。艾奇逊甚至害怕“谈判”这个概念。
    艾奇逊顽固地说，谈判，这是圈套；“狡猾的”共产党人想把“不够老练的”美国拉进这种圈套。艾奇逊恫吓欧洲人说，实现苏联和其他社会主义国家目的在于把欧洲变成和平区的建议会使美国退出欧洲。特别使他恼火的是，欧洲人自己对这个问题并不感到忧虑。然而要知道：欧洲的千百万人根本没有感到“苏联的威胁”。
    科里奥诺夫接着说，艾奇逊竟疯狂到这种程度，以至扬言：即使美国的欧洲盟友要求美国军队撤出欧洲，答应这种要求也是不正确的。这个西欧国家“卫士”的真面目就是这样。艾奇逊只证实了一点，所谓保证欧洲国家安全的虚伪叫喊无非是为了掩盖大洋彼岸的某些集团要继续保持对这些国家的统治的野心罢了。
    科里奥诺夫接着写道，艾奇逊臆想出一些根本站不住脚的理由来为保持当前孕育着莫大危险的西柏林不正常局势辩解。艾奇逊之流需要的是西柏林暗中有一个火花，以使他们能在随便什么时候火上浇油，酿成熊熊的烈火。
