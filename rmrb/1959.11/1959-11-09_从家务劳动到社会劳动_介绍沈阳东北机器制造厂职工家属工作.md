From Housework to Social Labor
Introducing the Work of Family Members of Employees at the Northeast Machine Manufacturing Plant in Shenyang

Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, under the brilliant illumination of the General Line, the family members of employees at the Northeast Machine Manufacturing Plant in Shenyang have broken down superstitions, liberated their minds, and with high spirits and soaring enthusiasm, have played an active role in socialist construction.

Supporting Production, Participating in Production

Over the past few years, the factory has adhered to the principle of mobilizing both employees and their families, uniting the family members around the Party, publicizing the Party's policies and resolutions among the family masses, and educating them to consciously abide by and implement them. During certain periods, the trade union has also made demands on family work like other aspects of work, formulated plans, and conducted inspections and summaries. In promoting the General Line and the campaign to increase production and practice economy, they organized into work groups to educate family activists and family members, deeply implementing the Party's guidelines and policies among the family masses.

The family work of this factory revolves around the central work of the factory in each period to serve production, thus gaining support and attention from all aspects. For example, in the campaign to increase production and practice economy, family members were called upon to save water and electricity; family members were organized to help each other to ensure that employees were on time for work; and during the construction of dormitories, family members launched a campaign to collect bricks, contributing 280,000 bricks to the factory. During last year's industrial "drought resistance" campaign, family members worked together and, in more than a month, collected 223 tons of scrap steel, 12,200 jin of firewood, 11 tons of various hardware, and 1,000 tons of refractory bricks.

In the Great Leap Forward year of 1958, the vast number of employee family members actively stepped out of their homes and participated in various social labors. Under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line, all family members broke down superstitions, liberated their minds, and carried forward the spirit of pragmatism and ingenuity. They collected a large amount of waste materials on their own, and with the support of the Party and the help of veteran workers in the workshops, established nine factories for cement, small hardware, nails, sewing, casting, etc. The number of family members participating in social labor accounted for 80% of the total number of family members. Since the beginning of this year, in vigorously launching mass movements and carrying out technical innovations, they have launched a red flag competition for high-yield and high-quality, saving the country 977,000 yuan in wealth in thirty-five products, strongly supporting the factory in completing the third quarter's production tasks ahead of schedule. After being cultivated by the Party and undergoing a year of production training, this new labor force has produced 37 advanced producers and red flag bearers in the 22nd workshop alone. Yu Suqin of the bearing workshop completes the task of 300 products per day, exceeding the quota of 200 products produced by ordinary male workers.

"Five Goods"

Through various political movements, this factory has established the idea of ​​labor glory and love for the factory as home among the family members of employees, and carried out the "Five Goods" work. These "Five Goods" are:

I. Diligence and thrift, living a good life. Most of the employee family members are good at managing their households, but there are also a few family members who are not clear about the understanding of diligence and thrift, and have no plans for living expenses. The factory assisted the family committee in educating the family members repeatedly about thrift and housekeeping through detailed accounting, comparison, organizing family members to listen to broadcasts, read newspapers, hold experience exchange meetings, and exhibitions. Since 1958, they have held five exhibitions on saving food, cotton, and saving household appliances, and sixty-five experience exchange meetings. After these educations, the ideological level of the family members has been greatly improved. Family members have come up with many new ways to save food, cloth, and coal. Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, 2,400 skilled housekeepers have emerged in the factory, and the total savings amount has reached 800,000 yuan, which has been praised by the bank. Many family members who did not know how to live in the past have learned to be diligent and thrifty, and to make careful calculations. Many people have plans for family expenses.

II. Carry out mutual assistance to ensure that employees are on time for work. In view of the fact that most of the employees are small families of couples, and they encounter many difficulties in getting sick and having children, the factory party committee called on family members to carry forward class friendship and carry out mutual assistance. Now, when family members have children or get sick, the group members take the initiative to take care of each other, helping to invite doctors, cook, buy vegetables, and wash clothes. This mutual assistance work has been going on for eight years. The current mutual assistance content has been expanded to buying rice, buying vegetables, and doing needlework. In the past three years, 5,257 family members have participated in mutual assistance, assisting for 1,140 days, thereby ensuring that employees go to work on time and actively participate in production.

III. Organize family members to engage in sideline occupations. This year, the area of ​​vegetable cultivation has increased from 200 mu last year to more than 300 mu, and 80% of family members have participated in vegetable cultivation. In the first half of the year, more than 300,000 jin of spring vegetables such as potatoes and cowpeas were harvested. After the autumn, family members vigorously developed sideline production such as raising pigs, chickens, and rabbits.

In order to adapt to the employment of the majority of employee family members, small commodity production and life service stations have also been organized to carry out waste recycling work.

IV. Do a good job in hygiene to ensure the health of employees. The family hygiene work of this factory has made great progress with the development of family work and the continuous improvement of employees' living standards. Participating in the Patriotic Health Campaign, it has been rewarded by Shenyang City and the factory for many years. In daily life, they also pay attention to the regulation of diet and the hygiene and diversification of food, thus ensuring the health of employees. Each family group has also established a hygiene inspection system.

V. Establish a united and harmonious new family. In 1958, there were 83 families in the factory that were discordant. After help and education, 74 families established new family relationships of mutual respect and mutual help. For example, Meng Shuqin, a family member, used to quarrel with her mother-in-law frequently. After the family organization helped her to change, the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law were very harmonious. Appropriate care has also been taken for family members with financial difficulties, reducing the burden on the state. Now 80% of the households in difficulty no longer need relief after participating in sideline production.

Self-Reliance in Running Welfare

Over the past few years, under the leadership of the Party, the family members of this factory have established welfare facilities such as canteens, nurseries, kindergartens, mutual aid groups, and service stations through self-reliance, which has solved the practical difficulties of the family members. During the Great Leap Forward in 1958, everyone started to set up 194 nurseries (now merged into six large nurseries and twenty nursery stations), which accommodated more than 6,900 children. The fifteen canteens and seven service stations they run have basically solved the difficulties for family members to participate in social labor and social activities. In running these welfare undertakings, the principle of simplicity and adapting to local conditions has been implemented.

    从家务劳动到社会劳动
    介绍沈阳东北机器制造厂职工家属工作
    沈阳东北机器制造厂职工家属，在1958年全民大跃进以来，在总路线的光辉照耀下，破除了迷信，解放了思想，意气风发，干劲冲天，在社会主义建设中发挥了积极的作用。
    支援生产　参加生产
    几年来，这个厂坚持了职工和家属一齐发动的方针，把职工家属团结在党的周围，在家属群众中宣传党的政策和决议，教育家属自觉地遵守和执行。在一定时期内，工会对家属工作也像其他方面的工作一样提出要求，制定计划，有检查、有总结。在宣传总路线和增产节约运动中，他们组织成工作组向家属积极分子和家属群众进行教育，把党的方针政策深入地贯彻到家属群众中去。
    这个厂的家属工作是围绕工厂每个时期的中心工作为生产服务，因而取得了各方面的支持和重视。如在增产节约运动中，号召家属节约水、电；组织家属互助，保证职工按时出勤，在建筑宿舍时，家属开展拣砖献宝运动，为工厂拣砖二十八万块。在去年工业“抗旱”运动中，家属们一齐动手，在一个多月中，就搜集了废钢铁二百二十三吨，木柴一万二千二百斤，各种五金十一吨，耐火砖一千吨。
    在大跃进的1958年，这个厂的广大职工家属纷纷走出家庭，积极参加了各项社会劳动。全体家属在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，破除迷信，解放思想，发扬了实干、巧干的精神，自己动手收集大量的废料，在党的支持和车间老工人的帮助下，办起了水泥、小五金、钉子、缝纫、铸造等九个工厂。全厂参加社会劳动的家属占家属总数的80％。今年以来，在大搞群众运动、大闹技术革新中，她们掀起了高产优质的红旗竞赛，在三十五种产品中为国家节约九十七万七千元财富，有力地支援了全厂提前完成第三季度的生产任务。这支新的劳动大军，经过党的培养和一年来的生产锻炼，仅二十二车间就涌现出三十七名先进生产者和红旗手。轴承车间于素琴，每天完成三百个产品的任务，超过了普通男工生产二百个产品的指标。
    “五好”
    通过各项政治运动，这个厂在职工家属中树立了劳动光荣、爱厂如家的思想，开展了“五好”工作。这“五好”是：
    一、勤劳节俭，过好日子。在职工家属中大部分是会过日子的，但也有少数家属对勤俭节约认识不清，生活开支没有计划。厂里帮助家属委员会，用算细账、对比、组织家属收听广播、读报、召开经验交流会、展览会等形式，反复向家属进行了勤俭持家的教育。1958年以来，他们召开了节约粮食、棉花、节约家庭用具等五次展览会，六十五次经验交流会。经过这些教育，大大提高了家属的思想水平。家属们想出了很多节约粮食、布匹、煤炭的新办法。1958年大跃进以来，全厂出现二千四百名勤俭持家能手，全厂储蓄额达八十万元，受到银行的表扬。许多过去不会过日子的家属都学会了勤俭持家，精打细算，许多人家庭开支有了计划。
    二、开展互助，保证职工按时出勤。厂党委根据职工绝大部分都是夫妇小家庭，遇到生病、生育困难很多的情况，号召家属发扬阶级友爱，开展互助。现在家属生孩子、有病，小组里都主动互相照顾，帮助请医生、做饭、买菜、洗衣服等。这种互助工作已经坚持了八年。现在的互助内容已经扩大到买米、买菜、做针线等方面。最近三年来，参加互助的家属达五千二百五十七人次，互助了一千一百四十天，从而保证职工按时上班，积极参加生产。
    三、组织家属搞副业。今年种菜由去年的二百亩增加到三百多亩，80％的家属都参加了种菜，上半年仅春菜土豆、豆角等就收了三十多万斤。入秋以后，家属们又大力开展养猪、鸡、兔等副业生产。
    为适应广大职工家属就业，还组织了小商品生产和生活服务站，开展了废物回收工作。
    四、搞好卫生，保证职工身体健康。这个厂的家属卫生工作，随着家属工作的发展和职工生活水平的不断提高得到了很大的进展。参加除四害运动，历年都受到了沈阳市和工厂的奖励，在日常生活中，她们也注意了饮食的调节和饭菜的卫生以及多样化，因而保证了职工的身体健康。各家属小组还建立了卫生检查制度。
    五、建立团结和睦的新家庭。1958年全厂家庭不和的有八十三户，经过帮助教育，有七十四户建立了互相尊敬互相帮助的新的家庭关系。如家属孟淑琴过去经常和婆婆吵架，通过家属组织帮助转变以后，婆媳非常和睦。对于生活困难的家属，也作了适当照顾，减少了国家负担。现在有80％困难户，参加副业生产以后，再不用救济了。
    自力更生办福利
    几年来，这个厂的家属在党的领导下，自力更生建立了食堂、托儿所、幼儿园、互助组、服务站等福利设施，解决了家属的切身困难。1958年大跃进中，大家动手开办了一百九十四个托儿所（现已合并为六个大型托儿所、二十个托儿站），共收容了六千九百多名儿童入托。她们办的十五处食堂、七处服务站，基本上解决了家属参加社会劳动和社会活动的困难。在举办这些福利事业中，贯彻了因陋就简，因地制宜的方针。
