Another Great Bridge Spans the Yellow River

The Jima Yellow River Highway Bridge in Qinghai Province recently opened to traffic. Located in the Golog Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, at an altitude of 4,000 meters, this bridge is the uppermost highway bridge on the Yellow River. It connects the two highways from Huashixia to Jima and from Jima to Aba Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Sichuan Province within Qinghai Province. After its opening, it will make transportation between the two provinces more convenient, and the political, economic, and cultural development of the two minority areas will be faster. The bridge is more than 150 meters long and is made of reinforced concrete. Construction began in May of last year.

    又一大桥跨黄河
    青海省吉迈黄河公路桥最近通车。这座桥位于果洛藏族自治州境内，拔海四千米，是目前黄河最上游的一座公路桥。它联结着青海省内花石峡到吉迈和吉迈到四川省阿坝藏族自治州地区的两条公路，通车后，将使两省间的交通更加便利，两个少数民族地区的政治、经济、文化能够更快地发展。这座桥长一百五十多米，是钢筋混凝土结构，去年5月开始动工修建。
