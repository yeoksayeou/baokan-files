    New Ways to Increase Rosin Production
    Ministry of Forestry, Forest Industry Department
    In order to strive to overfulfill this year's rosin production tasks, Heilongjiang, Zhejiang and other provinces, in addition to vigorously developing rosin tapping, have also created the experience of extracting rosin by boiling "mingzi" (resin-rich pine pieces). At present, the two provinces are vigorously promoting this experience throughout the province. Judging from the existing materials, this method has a very good effect. Generally, 12 to 15 jin of rosin can be extracted from every 100 jin of "mingzi" fragments, and the production equipment is simple and not limited by the season. This resource is richly endowed in various provinces and regions. Widely carrying out water boiling of "mingzi" is a new way to increase rosin production.
    All pine roots and "mingzi" rich in rosin (preferably "mingzi") are usable raw materials. The so-called "mingzi" refers to old roots and trunks rich in rosin that have been buried in the soil for a long time.
    The method of extracting rosin by boiling "mingzi" in water can be divided into the following three types according to the equipment and processing technology:
    The first type is the method of producing rosin by boiling "mingzi" in water by the Dafeng Forestry Bureau of Heilongjiang. This method can be carried out with only a wide-mouth iron pot. In order to hold more raw materials and improve the quality of rosin, it is best to install a cylinder about 60 cm high above the mouth of the iron pot.
    During processing, simply put the "mingzi" fragments directly into the pot, put a wooden frame on the fragments and press them down with stones to prevent the fragments from floating. After filling the material, add clean water immediately. The amount of water should be enough to submerge the fragments by 10 cm. Then, start a fire to heat. When the water temperature rises to 70 to 80 degrees Celsius, the rosin in the "mingzi" fragments will melt due to the heat and begin to float on the water surface. When the water boils, a large amount of rosin will float up.
    Using this method, generally boiling for about four hours will extract most of the rosin from the fragments. At this time, new materials can be replaced, and new materials can be replaced every four hours thereafter.
    The second type is the method of using steam to boil "mingzi" in water to produce rosin, which was created by the employees of Langxiang Forestry Bureau of Heilongjiang Province in the recent technical innovation and increased production and savings campaign. The main equipment is a boiler (waste gas from sawmill or heating boilers can also be used) and wooden tanks. During processing, the "mingzi" fragments can be first put into a wooden frame, and then the wooden frame is put into a wooden tank. One wooden tank can hold eight large frames. Add a pressure bar on the frame to prevent the fragments from floating. Then add water, the amount of water should be enough to submerge the fragments by about 5 cm. After the material is loaded, the steam valve can be opened to introduce steam for heating to keep the water boiling. In this way, the rosin will melt in the fragments due to the heat and float on the water surface, and the rosin on the water surface can be scooped out with a wooden scraper. Generally, the material can be boiled once every 40 minutes of steam. According to the experience of this bureau, each tank can hold 270 kilograms of "mingzi" fragments and can extract 27 kilograms of rosin. Twelve tanks can be produced every eight hours.
    The third type is the "method of producing rosin and turpentine by boiling 'mingzi' in water" successfully tested by the Zhejiang Provincial Institute of Forestry Science. The main equipment of this method is a large pot with a diameter of four feet, with a three-foot-high cylinder embedded on it. A wooden cover is installed above the cylinder (one side is fixed and the other side can be removed). A bamboo tube is connected to the cover to form a steam guide tube and a cooling tube (see the attached figure).
    During processing, add the fragments from the mouth of the cylinder until it is one and a half feet away from the mouth of the cylinder. Then add clean water to the pot, the amount of water should be added to one foot and two inches away from the mouth of the cylinder. Finally, put on the wooden cover, latch the wooden latch, and stuff the cracks with rags, old cotton, etc., and coat with clay to prevent steam leakage. At this time, you can start a fire to heat. Use strong fire at the beginning to make the rosin in the fragments heat and melt, so that the distilled turpentine will be steamed out with water vapor, and after condensation, it will flow into the oil-water separator. When no turpentine is distilled out after about two hours of distillation, the lid of the cylinder can be opened, and the "mingzi" fragments in the pot can be stirred vigorously with a wooden stick, and the rosin will float to the surface of the water. According to the report of the Zhejiang Forestry Department, each 100 jin of "mingzi" fragments can extract 1.5 jin of turpentine and 11 jin of rosin. According to the results of the recent production of the Linchan Chemical Plant of Tingzi People's Commune in Lin'an County, Zhejiang, using this method, turpentine has increased to 4%-5%, and rosin has increased to 18%-26%.

    增产松香的新途径
    林业部森林工业司
    黑龙江、浙江等省为了力争超额完成今年松香生产任务，除了大力开展采割松脂外，并创造了水煮明子提取松脂的经验。目前两省正在全省范围内大力推广这项经验。从已有的材料看，这个方法的效果很好，一般每百斤明子碎片可煮取松脂十二至十五斤，而且生产设备简单并且不受季节限制。这项资源各省区都有丰富的蕴藏。广泛地开展水煮明子，是增产松脂的一个新途径。
    凡富含松脂的松根和明子（最好是明子）都是可用的原料。所谓明子是指长期埋藏在土壤中的，老的富含松脂的根株和树干。
    水煮明子提取松脂的方法，根据设备及加工工艺过程可分为下面三种：
    第一种是黑龙江大丰林业局水煮明子生产松脂的方法。这种方法只要阔口铁锅即可进行生产。为了多盛原料和提高松脂的质量，最好是在铁锅口上面嵌装约六十厘米高的圆桶。
    加工时只需将明子碎料直接装入锅内，碎料上放一木架并以石块压住，以免碎料上浮。装料后随即加入清水，加水量以能淹没碎料十厘米深为宜。然后即可生火加热，水温升至摄氏七十至八十度时，明子碎料中的松脂便受热熔融，开始浮游水面，待水沸腾时就有多量的松脂上浮。
    用这种方法，一般煮四小时左右，碎料中可煮出的松脂已经大部出来。这时可另换新料，以后每四小时换新料一次。
    第二种是黑龙江省朗乡林业局职工在最近技术革新、增产节约运动中创造的利用蒸汽水煮明子生产松脂的方法。其主要设备是锅炉（也可利用制材厂或取暖用的锅炉废气）和木槽等。加工时可将明子碎料先装入木框中，随即将木框放入木槽里，一个木槽可装八大框，框上加压杠，以免碎料上浮。然后加水，水量以能淹没碎料五厘米左右为宜。料装好后，即可打开汽阀通入蒸汽加热，使水保持沸腾。这样，松脂受热便在碎料中熔融而浮在水面，即可用木拉爬把水面上的松脂舀取出来。一般每通汽四十分钟就可煮料一次。据这个局的经验，每槽可装明子碎料二百七十公斤，能提取松脂二十七公斤，每八小时可生产十二槽。
    第三种是浙江省林业科学研究所试验成功的“水煮明子生产松香、松节油的方法”。这种方法的主要设备是在四尺直径的大锅上面嵌装三尺高的圆桶，桶的上方装置木盖（半边固定，半边可卸下）。盖上联接竹管制成导汽管、冷却管（见附图）。
    加工时，将碎料从桶口加入，加至距离桶口一尺半处为止。然后向锅中加入清水，水量加到距离桶口一尺二寸处为宜。最后将木盖盖上，闩紧木闩，各裂缝处嵌塞破布、旧棉花等，并涂以粘土，防止漏汽。这时候即可生火加热。开始宜用猛火，使碎料中的松脂受热而熔融，这样蒸出的松节油就随水蒸汽蒸出来，经过冷凝后，流入油水分离器中。在蒸馏二小时左右已无松节油蒸出的时候，即可打开桶盖，用木棒用力搅拌锅中的明子碎料，松香即浮到水面。根据浙江林业厅汇报，这样生产，每一百斤明子碎料可提取松节油一斤半，松香十一斤。另据最近浙江临安县亭子人民公社林产化工厂用这种方法生产结果证明，松节油已增到4％—5％，松香18％—26％。（附图片）
