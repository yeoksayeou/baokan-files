Early Winter Irrigation of Wheat Has Many Benefits
Qinghui Canal Improvement Method Accelerates Irrigation

According to the Shaanxi Daily, the winter irrigation progress in the Qinghui Canal irrigation area of Sanyuan County, Shaanxi Province, has been rapid this year. As of the 13th of this month, 15,000 mu of wheat have been winter-irrigated, accounting for 24% of the summer field area that should be irrigated. The irrigation efficiency has increased by 30% compared to previous years. The plan is to complete all irrigation before December 15th. This year's winter irrigation work in this irrigation area is fast and of good quality, with no ground erosion or standing water.

The Qinghui Canal has 50,000 mu of irrigable summer fields this year, with a flow rate of 0.52 cubic meters. According to the past irrigation efficiency, at most 700 mu could be irrigated per day, requiring 71 days to complete. This year, the irrigation method has been changed, and 1,000 mu can be irrigated per day, which can be completed in 50 days.

The reasons for this year's high irrigation efficiency and good quality are, on the one hand, that the people's commune system has brought many advantages to irrigation, and on the other hand, that the right-leaning slackness and difficulties in various aspects have been continuously overcome. The Qinghui Canal Administration proposed to start winter irrigation as early as October 25th. At that time, some people suspected that the winter irrigation started too early and were afraid that it would be bad for the crops. Therefore, in the first few days of irrigation, only 400 to 500 mu of land were irrigated per day. The Party committees of various communes organized field inspections and on-site discussions for the members to address the above-mentioned ideas. Through inspections and discussions, everyone unanimously realized that this year's winter irrigation was not only not starting too early, but also needed to be accelerated. Because: 1. More than 95% of this year's wheat is replanted from corn fields, cotton fields, and vegetable fields. Some fields were not carefully prepared after deep plowing, resulting in the phenomenon of hanging roots and dead seedlings. Irrigation can reduce this phenomenon. 2. Since most of the wheat fields are fertilized with farm manure, which decomposes and dissolves slowly, irrigation can promote the decomposition of fertilizer. 3. The wheat planted around October 5th this year has been growing vigorously in winter due to sufficient moisture, abundant fertilizer, and high soil temperature. Irrigation can regulate soil temperature, increase root development, and inhibit stem growth. 4. Some wheat has suffered from insect pests to varying degrees. Early winter irrigation can prevent insect pests and also prevent black powder disease. 5. Currently, it is the period of wheat rooting and tillering. Irrigation not only stores water and preserves moisture, promotes wheat rooting and tillering, but also enhances cold resistance.

Some places have dispelled some people's doubts about winter irrigation by looking at the fact that early winter irrigation increased production last year.

On the basis of raising the awareness of the members and strengthening the confidence that early winter irrigation is beneficial and harmless, in order to overcome the waste of water, the members were also educated on water conservation, so that the members were not only willing to irrigate early, but also tried to save water. The water-saving measures taken in various places are: before irrigation, the two main canals, six branch canals, forty-four bucket canals, two hundred and twenty small canals, and five hundred and thirty buildings were all inspected or repaired, and seventy more water gates were added to ensure water safety. Secondly, more than 25,000 mu of wheat land has been transformed into garden fields through renovation, which has increased irrigation efficiency by one-third and saved half of the manpower. Third, the Qinghui Canal Administration also helped various communes train irrigation technicians, and at the same time implemented "four guarantees" (guarantee water, guarantee time, guarantee irrigation area, guarantee quality) in water use. Each team also implemented "five guarantees" (guarantee water, guarantee time, guarantee area, guarantee quality, guarantee work points) for the watering team, plus continuous inspection, to ensure irrigation efficiency and quality. Now, each team has changed the previous practice of watering on sunny days but not on cloudy days, watering more during the day and less at night.

### 小麦提早冬灌好处多  清惠渠改进方法加速灌溉

    小麦提早冬灌好处多
    清惠渠改进方法加速灌溉
    据陕西日报消息  陕西三原县清惠渠灌区今年冬灌进度迅速，截至本月13日，已冬灌小麦一万五千亩，占应灌夏田面积的24％。灌溉效率比往年提高了30％。计划赶12月15日前全部灌完。这个灌区今年冬灌工作灌的快，也灌的好，地面无冲刷、无明水。
    清惠渠今年共有可灌夏田五万亩，流量零点五二个，按照已往灌溉效率，每天最多灌七百亩，需要七十一天才能灌完。今年改变了灌溉方法，每天可灌一千亩，五十天就可以灌完。
    今年灌溉效率高、质量好的原因，一方面是人民公社化后给灌溉带来了很多优越条件，另一方面还由于不断克服了各方面的右倾松劲情绪和困难。清惠渠管理局早就提出10月25日开始冬灌，当时有人怀疑冬灌开始早了，害怕灌了对庄稼不好。因而在灌溉开始头几天，每天只灌四、五百亩地。各公社党委针对上述思想，组织社员田间检查，地头座谈，通过检查、座谈，大家一致认识到今年冬灌不仅开始的不算早，而且需要快马加鞭。因为：1、今年的麦子95％以上是玉米地、棉花地、菜地回种的，部分田块深翻后整地不细，出现了吊根死苗现象，灌了以后便可以减少这种现象。2、由于大部分麦地上的是农家肥料，分解溶化慢，灌后可以促使肥料分解。3、今年10月5日左右种的麦子，由于墒饱，肥多，加上地温高，麦子发生冬旺现象，灌后可以调节地温，增加根部发育，抑制茎部生长。4、有些麦子程度不同的发生了虫害，早些冬灌就可以防止虫害，还可以防治黑粉病。5、目前正是小麦盘根分蘖时期，灌了不仅蓄水保墒，促进麦子盘根分蘖，而且可以增强抗寒能力。
    有些地方通过去年冬灌早增产多的事实，解除了一些人对冬灌的怀疑。
    在提高社员认识，坚定提早冬灌有利无害的信心的基础上，为了克服用水浪费现象，还向社员进行节约用水的教育，使社员们不仅愿意早灌，而且想办法省水。各地采取的省水办法是：在灌溉前，把两个干渠，六个支渠，四十四条斗渠，二百二十条小渠和五百三十处建筑物都检查或整修了一遍，还增添了输水闸板七十个，保证了输水安全。其次，有二万五千多亩麦地，经过整修已实现了园田化，使灌溉效率提高了三分之一，同时节省一半人力。第三，清惠渠管理局还帮助各公社训练了灌溉技术员，同时在用水上实行“四包”（包水、包时间、包灌溉面积、包质量），各队又对浇地队实行“五包”（包水、包时、包面积、包质量、包工分），加上不断检查，保证了灌溉效率和质量。现在各队已改变了以往浇晴不浇阴，白天浇地多，晚上浇地少的作法。
