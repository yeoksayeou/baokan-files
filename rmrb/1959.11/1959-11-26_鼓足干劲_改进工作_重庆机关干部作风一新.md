Amidst the surging high tide of the continuing Great Leap Forward, Chongqing municipal government cadres have been working with great vigor, improving their work style, and showing a vibrant new atmosphere in all aspects of work and production.

Now, examples of government organs completing tasks ahead of schedule and with excellence are constantly emerging. The Labor Wage Statistics Group of the Chongqing Municipal Planning Commission's Statistics Department once emphasized that they were short-handed and had heavy tasks, and that the monthly reports could never be submitted on time. Since emphasizing putting politics in command and tapping potential, this fear of difficulty has been overcome, and they have quickly been able to submit reports on time, with quality and quantity assured. The Chongqing Labor Bureau has changed its past inability to complete tasks well in its allocation work. Recently, when the Chongqing Iron and Steel Company's large open-hearth furnace was being repaired, seventy-two technicians were needed within two days. The Labor Bureau dispatched seventy-five on time, exceeding the task. Now, cadres in this bureau reflect that in the past, they would always study and understand tasks assigned by higher authorities before acting, but now they resolutely implement them and complete them ahead of schedule and beyond the quota. When the Civil Engineering Group of the First Design Office of the Chongqing Coal Mine Design Institute accepted the October task, they complained and feared difficulties, believing it was impossible to complete. After thoroughly breaking down right-leaning conservative ideas and feelings of fear, difficulty, and relaxation, the entire group acted in unison and worked with great vigor, resulting in exceeding the task by 62.3%.

During the Great Leap Forward, many government organs have seen a large number of new people and new events emerge. The Chongqing Coal Mine Design Institute further carried out competitive matches, with everyone chasing and catching up, and the advanced helping the backward, forming a surge. Yao Zuxin, an engineer from the Electrical and Mechanical Group and a municipal advanced producer, took the initiative to accept the design tasks for power plants for factories such as the Jianshe Machine Tool Factory, Chongqing Plastics Factory, and Tianyuan Chemical Factory, which not only supported key construction but also promoted the over-fulfillment of production tasks in his own unit. Assistant technician Tan Qiyou not only achieved high quality and high output himself, but also helped another comrade improve design methods, increasing the output from one drawing every three days to three drawings per day, improving work efficiency eightfold. In the work of designing a railway line for the Qijiang Iron Mine, the Third Design Office of the Municipal Design Institute revised the plan three times, carefully calculated costs, found measures, and arranged cleverly, shortening the originally planned eighteen working days to seven, completing the design ahead of schedule and with good quality.

The work styles of leading cadres and general cadres have also undergone further changes. Leading cadres of the Urban Construction Bureau grasp political and ideological work on the one hand and production tasks on the other, and take time to go deep into the field, visit grassroots cadres and workers, and help solve problems in a timely manner, which greatly encourages the staff. The work styles of the various sections, offices, and departments of this bureau have also become more in-depth and meticulous, and problems are solved in a timely manner. For the urgently needed machinery, tracks, and other materials for the Yubei Railway, they have adopted a method of seeing things through to the end, personally delivering them to the site.

    鼓足干劲　改进工作
    重庆机关干部作风一新
    本报讯　在轰轰烈烈的继续跃进高潮中，重庆市机关干部鼓足了干劲，改进了作风，工作和生产劳动各方面都出现了朝气蓬勃的新气象。
    现在，各机关干部提前并出色完成工作任务的事例层出不穷。市计划委员会统计处劳动工资统计组曾一度强调人少任务重，月报总不能按时上报。自从强调了政治挂帅，发挥了潜力，这种畏难情绪克服了，很快就做到如质如量按时上报。市劳动局在调配工作上改变了过去不能很好完成任务的情况，最近重钢大平炉检修，两天内需要七十二名技工，劳动局按时给调去了七十五名，超额完成了任务。现在这个局的干部反映说：过去上级交下的任务总是要研究研究，了解了解再说，现在是坚决执行，并提前超额完成。重庆煤矿设计院第一设计室土建组接受10月份任务时，曾叫苦畏难，认为没法完成。经过大破右倾保守思想和畏难松劲情绪后，全组一致行动，大鼓干劲，结果超额62.3％完成了任务。
    在跃进中，许多机关都涌现出大量新人新事。重庆煤矿设计院进一步开展对手赛，你追我赶，先进帮助落后，形成热潮。机电组工程师、市先进生产者尧祖信主动接受建设机床厂、重庆塑料厂、天原化工厂等厂的电厂设计任务，不仅支援了重点建设，也促进了本单位生产任务超额完成。助理技术员谭其有不但自己做到优质高产，还帮助另一个同志改进设计方法，使原三天出一张图纸提高到一天出三张，工作效率提高八倍。市设计院第三设计室在为綦江铁矿设计铁路线工作中，三次修改计划，算细账，找措施，巧安排，把原定十八个工作日缩短到七个，提前完成设计，并且质量很好。
    领导干部和一般干部的工作作风也都有了进一步的转变。城市建设局领导干部一手抓政治思想工作，一手抓生产任务，并抽空深入现场，访问基层干部和工人，发现问题及时帮助解决，职工受到很大鼓舞。这个局的各科、室、处的工作作风也更加深入细致，解决问题及时，对渝碚铁路所急需的机具、轨道等物资，都采取一竿子到底的办法，亲自送到现场。
