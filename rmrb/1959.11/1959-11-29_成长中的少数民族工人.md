Under the brilliant light of the Party's ethnic policy, Inner Mongolia already has nearly 60,000 minority workers from Mongolian, Hui, Manchu, Korean, Daur, and Oroqen ethnic groups. They are like countless magnificent and brilliant flowers, growing and becoming stronger in the autonomous region's socialist construction, playing an increasingly important role.

Baotou Steel’s No. 1 blast furnace is one of China's largest automated blast furnaces. In the hoist room, Mongolian youth technician Aliya stared intently at the various electrical instruments controlling the blast furnace's charging system, including the large and small material bells and the main hoist. To ensure the blast furnace produced iron as soon as possible, he led more than fifty workers, fighting day and night, adopting parallel assembly line methods for installation and wire connection, completing the technical adjustment of the most complex electrical control device of the blast furnace charging system five days ahead of schedule, ensuring the blast furnace produced iron on time.

It was the Spring Festival of 1946. The children of the herdsman were celebrating the holiday, while sixteen-year-old Aliya was herding cattle in the freezing wind and snow. The more he thought about it, the angrier he became. In a fit of anger, he killed the herdsman's cow and joined the Eighth Route Army. Later, the Party sent him to study at Liaoxi Military and Political University, Inner Mongolia Military and Political University, and Jilin Industrial College for six years, and later sent him to the Soviet Union for an internship. In April 1959, he came to the construction site of Baotou Steel's No. 1 blast furnace. At this time, Aliya was already a red technician and a Communist Party member.

In the Baotou Automobile Repair Factory, everyone calls Communist Party member and fifth-grade fitter Jinshan the "omnipotent master." He has been in the factory for less than five years and has already mastered multiple techniques such as fitting, casting, and carpentry. In April last year, Jinshan accepted a batch of 500 silicon steel sheet manufacturing tasks. Jinshan consulted with experienced electricians and read technical books to understand the silicon steel sheet manufacturing method, but it had to be punched manually. One person could make one silicon sheet in a day, and quality could not be guaranteed. What to do? One day, he thought of the principle of the automatic feed of the slotting machine. If a die was installed on the punch and the slotting machine was automated, wouldn't it be possible to turn manual operation into automation? With the support of the Party and the help of comrades, the automatic die for making silicon sheets was soon successfully manufactured.

Another locomotive, puffing white steam, pulled into the Hohhot Locomotive Depot. The sturdy Qilong Bagan put on his work gloves, pushed his hat back, and climbed onto the locomotive that needed repair with three apprentices...

Qilong Bagan was born in a herdsman's family near Ulanhot. At the age of seven, he followed his father to herd sheep and did not go to school until after liberation. After graduating from middle school, he came to the Hohhot Railway Locomotive Depot. As soon as he entered the factory, the leadership sent excellent workers to teach him. Han Chinese master craftsmen taught their apprentices at the factory during the day and at the dormitory after work, and even regarded teaching apprentices as their main new holiday activity on Sundays. In August last year, Qilong Bagan finally operated independently. Every time he crawled out from under the train, he would silently say to the train: "No problem, buddy, run wild!" At this time, he always thought of the Han Chinese master who taught him hand-in-hand, and a sweet feeling arose in his heart.

In the golden Greater Khingan Mountains, Mongolian worker Wu En drove his Iron Bull tractor, creating a new record of hauling 205 cubic meters of wood at a time. When Wu En is mentioned, everyone in the Greater Khingan Mountains forest area knows that this young man has a knack for hard work. When he first started driving a tractor, he could only haul forty or fifty cubic meters of wood at a time. Later, he studied diligently, using his rest time to learn from the advanced experiences of other forest areas, grasping the keys of "riding frozen tracks" and "filling snow to repair roads," and installing a "top bar" between each sled to prevent derailments, string pieces, collisions, and other accidents, increasing the towing capacity to 215 cubic meters.

    成长中的少数民族工人
    在党的民族政策的光辉照耀下，内蒙古已有近六万名蒙古、回、满、朝鲜、达斡尔、鄂伦春等少数民族职工。他们好像无数朵绚丽灿烂的花朵，在自治区的社会主义建设中成长、壮大，起着愈来愈大的作用。

    包钢一号高炉是我国最大的自动化高炉之一。在卷扬机室里，蒙古族青年技术员阿力亚，全神贯注地凝视着操纵高炉上料系统大小料钟和主卷扬机的各种电器仪表。为确保高炉早日出铁，他带领五十多名工人，日夜奋战，采取安装校线平行流水作业法，提前五天完成了高炉上料系统最复杂的电气控制装置的技术调整工作，保证高炉按时出了铁。
    那是1946年春节。牧主家里的孩子正在欢度节日，而十六岁的阿力亚却在风雪严寒里放牛。他愈想愈生气，激怒之下，打死了牧主家的牛，参加了八路军。之后，党送他到辽西军政大学、内蒙古军政大学、吉林工业专科等学校学习了六年，以后还送他到苏联去实习。1959年4月，他来到包钢一号高炉工地，这时的阿力亚已是一个红色技术员、共产党员了。

    在包头汽车修配厂里，人人都称共产党员、五级钳工金山是“万能师傅”。他到工厂还不到五年，已掌握了钳工、铸工、木工等多种技术。去年4月，金山接受了一批五百个硅钢片的制造任务。金山一面请教电工老师傅，一面翻阅技术书，硅钢片制作方法弄清楚了，可是得用人工冲制。一个硅片一个人干一天，还保证不了质量，怎么办呢？一天，他想起插床自动走车的原理。如果在冲床上安装一个冲模，让插床自动，不就能使手工操作变成自动化吗？在党的支持和同志们的帮助下，不久，制作硅片的自动冲模制造成功了。

    又一台机车“吃吃”地吐着白气，开进了呼和浩特机务段。身体结结实实的齐龙巴干戴上工作手套，把帽子往后一推，和三个徒工爬到了需要检修的火车头上……。
    齐龙巴干出生在乌兰浩特附近一个牧民家里。七岁上，就跟着父亲放羊，解放后才上了学。中学毕业后，他来到呼和浩特铁路机务段。一进厂，领导上就派优秀工人来教他。汉族老师傅带着自己的徒弟，白天在工厂教，下班到宿舍教，星期天也把教徒弟当作自己假日新的主要活动。去年8月，齐龙巴干终于独立操作了。每当他从火车底下爬出来，对着火车默默地说过：“没问题了，伙计，你撒开疯跑吧！”这时，他总想起手把手教过自己的汉族老师傅，心里产生一股甜丝丝的味道。

    在金色的大兴安岭里，蒙古族工人悟恩，驾驶着他的铁牛号拖拉机，创造了一次拉二百零五立方米木材的新纪录。提起悟恩来，大兴安岭林区的人都知道：小伙子有那么一股钻劲。他刚开始驾驶拖拉机时，一次只能拉四、五十立方米木材，以后，他刻苦钻研，利用休息时间到临近林区去学习别人的先进经验，抓住了“乘冻跑车”和“填雪补道”的关键，并在每节爬犁之间安了一个“顶杠”，防止了掉道，串件子、撞车等事故的发生，使牵引量提高到二百一十五立方米。
