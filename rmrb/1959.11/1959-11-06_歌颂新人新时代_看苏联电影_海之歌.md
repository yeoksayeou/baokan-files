    Singing the Praises of New People and a New Era
    ——Watching the Soviet Film "Poem of the Sea"
  　Xu Tao
    Alexander Dovzhenko, the late Soviet film art master's last work, "Poem of the Sea," is a film with high ideological and profound artistic qualities. It summarizes the noble moral character of the Soviet people and writes about their grand ideals. With an extremely majestic and vigorous spirit, high passion and imagination, and an innovative and original technique, the director created this picture full of strong realistic significance and condensed with the artist's subjective fantasy of poetic artistic conception to depict the life and struggle of the Soviet people in building their socialist motherland. This is a poem praising the Soviet era, a poem praising the rich soul of the Soviet people.
    Due to the author's infinite passion and bold imagination, he selected all available techniques to enrich the language of the film. For example, in such an unforgettable scene: the collective farm chairman Zarudny (played by Andreyev) goes to the office to look for that extremely bad young man, Gorik, but Gorik is in a meeting, and he sits there waiting for him. But how can his emotional excitement, his disgust and hatred for this kind of person, make him sit there calmly? The audience cannot wait either, we all hope that he can beat this bad guy right away. This is the author's realistic basis. So the author gives Zarudny a whip, giving him an imaginary realm, and this morally corrupt young man is severely whipped. This is the author whipping this kind of scum in life, the dregs of the people, with extreme hatred. The author also let Zarudny say while whipping:
          “……Where did you come from? You crawled out from the cracks
    of the old society, wanting to climb into communism?……I can't
    tolerate it! I haven't been idle for a moment in the past twenty-five years, my hard work is everywhere here,……For the new sea, I wiped my own village off the face of the earth, destroyed my own house, I was born and raised here, everything here seems to grow out of me. If we can treat each other like this—deceiving, slandering, insulting, then what do we need this sea for? If in our hearts, there are no waves of the sea, only the stinky water of a swamp, why do we need a new sea?……” This is the great and pure soul of the author shouting, this is the artist summarizing the reality of social struggle, excavating the inner world of sincere people in life, and depicting a moving scene with superb film techniques. There are many other profound and novel touching chapters in the film similar to this.
    The author depicts the three-dimensional aspect of Soviet social life, writing about the complex feelings of people and the multifaceted relationships between people. The film spends a considerable amount of space writing about the memories of some people about their past experiences. They fully understand that destroying some old things can bring richer and more beautiful new things. They have proven and believed from many facts that Soviet society is developing in this way, and has already done everything for them to live more happily. However, they are so reluctant to part with an old house, an old tree, even a fence and a courtyard. Are these people conservative and ignorant? No, this is human nature. They love these familiar things, but they love a happy future even more. The author deeply understands this, and he focuses on criticizing those who turn a deaf ear and a blind eye to the great cause of building communism.
    As for the character of the collective farm chairman Zarudny with sad feelings; General Fyodorchenko recalled the tragic war as soon as he arrived in his hometown, making the thoughts, feelings, and character of these two characters more profound and vivid. Do they have the right to forget those sad and tragic pasts during the period of peaceful construction, during the period of already enjoying a happy life? The pictures and montage used by the director when Fyodorchenko walked in the wheat field by the river in his hometown are excellent. Fyodorchenko walked, and the music and sound began to play the melody and whistles of the war. Fyodorchenko began to enter the realm of memory, and then the screen showed the scenes of Hitler's bandit army tanks, artillery fire, and burning wheat fields. Fyodorchenko's steps became faster and faster, and the artillery fire of the war became more and more intense, forming a jump in which the shots of reality and memory were interwoven and connected, forming an absolute freedom of time and space. What the author wants to achieve is not only a strong sense of rhythm, but more importantly, to choose a more realistic and vivid perspective for the audience, to look at the ideological dynamics of the characters from history, and to look at the past from the development of the characters' emotions. He successfully broke through the general techniques of "superimposition" and "fantasy," and boldly and innovatively enriched the film's montage effect. Secondly, the performance of the war scenes, such as many corpses floating in the river; the doctor covered in blood performing surgery on the wounded; the general himself bandaging with bright red blood..., are all shocking! "Poem of the Sea" gave us education on this point: we love peace and oppose wars of aggression. The lessons of blood must never be forgotten, especially when we are engaged in peaceful construction and living a happy life, we must remember the disasters of war and be vigilant! The artist who loves the motherland, the people, and the peaceful and happy life, here passionately praised the great organizer of the Soviet Communist Party who leads the people to build a happy life, praised the all-conquering labor of the builders of the new society, and encouraged the people who are building socialism and communism.

### 歌颂新人新时代——看苏联电影“海之歌”

    歌颂新人新时代
    ——看苏联电影“海之歌”
  　徐韬
    苏联已故的电影艺术大师亚力山大·杜甫仁科的最后遗作“海之歌”，是一部具有高度思想性和深刻艺术性的影片，它概括了苏维埃人的高尚的道德品质，写出了他们宏伟的理想。而导演又以极其雄伟浑厚的气魄，高度的激情和想像，以革新的独创性的手法，创造出这幅富有强烈现实意义，并凝结着艺术家的极富于诗的意境的主观幻想的情景，去描绘苏维埃人建设社会主义祖国生活和斗争的图景。这是歌颂苏维埃时代的诗篇，是歌颂苏维埃人的丰富心灵的诗篇。
    由于作者的无限激情，大胆的想像，他选取了一切能用的手法来丰富电影的语言。如这样一个难忘的场面：农庄主席扎鲁德尼（安德列耶夫扮演）到办公室去寻找那个品质极端恶劣的青年戈力克，但戈力克在开会，他坐在那儿等他。可是他的感情的激动，对这种人物的憎恶和痛恨，怎能使他平静地坐在那里呢，观众也不能等待，我们都希望他能把这个坏家伙马上痛打一顿。这就是作者的现实根据。于是作者就给予扎鲁德尼以鞭子，给他一个假想的境界，这个品质败坏的青年就被狠狠地鞭打了一顿。这就是作者以万分憎恨的心情痛打这种生活中的渣滓，人民中的败类。作者并且让扎鲁德尼在鞭打的时候说：
          “……你是哪儿来的？你是从旧
    社会的破缝里爬出来的，想爬进共产
    主义？……我不能容忍！二十五年来我没有闲过一会儿，这儿到处有我的心血，……为了新的海，我把自个儿的村子从地面上抹掉，毁掉自个儿的房子，我是这儿土生土长的，这儿什么都像从我身上生长出来的一样。如果我们可以这样互相对待——欺骗、诽谤、侮辱，那我们要这个海做什么？如果在我们的心灵里，没有海的波浪，只有泥潭的臭水，为什么我们需要新的海？……”这是作者伟大而纯洁的心灵在呼喊，这是艺术家概括社会斗争的现实，挖掘生活中真诚的人的内心世界，以高超的电影手法，描绘出来的动人心弦的场景。电影里还有不少同这类似的意味深远、手法新颖的动人的章节。
    作者描绘出苏联社会生活的立体面，写出人的复杂感情和人与人之间的多方面的关系。影片以相当多的篇幅写了一些人们对于过去经历的回忆，他们完全懂得破坏一些旧的，是能够得来更丰富、更美丽的新的东西，他们已经从许多事实中证明和相信，苏维埃社会是这样发展着，而且是为他们生活得更幸福，已经做过的一切事情。然而他们却对一幢旧屋，一棵老树，甚至篱墙、院落都那么恋恋难舍。这些人是守旧愚昧吗？不，这是人之常情。他们爱这些熟悉的事物，但他们更热爱幸福的未来。作者深切地懂得这一点，他着重地批判了那些对豪迈地建设着共产主义事业充耳不闻、有目无睹的人。
    至于农庄主席扎鲁德尼这个人物怀着忧伤的感情；将军费道尔钦科一走到家乡就回忆起惨痛的战争，使这样两个人物的思想、感情、性格更为深厚，更加生动。难道他们有权利在和平建设时期，在度着已经是幸福生活的时期，忘掉那些使人忧伤、惨痛的过去吗？导演处理费道尔钦科走在家乡河边的麦田里，所运用的画面和蒙太奇是出色的。费道尔钦科走着，开始是音乐和音响奏起了战争的旋律和呼哨，费道尔钦科开始进入了回忆的境界，接着画面出现了希特勒匪军的坦克、炮火和麦田燃烧的场景。费道尔钦科的步子越走越快，战争的炮火愈来愈激烈，构成现实与回忆的镜头交错衔接而形成一种时间与空间绝对自由的跳跃。作者要达到的不仅是强烈的节奏感，更重要的是为观众选择更现实而生动的角度，从历史去看人物的思想动态，从人物感情的发展去看过去，他成功地突破了一般的“叠印”“幻想”的手法，而大胆革新地丰富了电影蒙太奇效果。其次是战争场面的表现，如河中漂浮着许多尸体；医生满身鲜血在为伤员进行手术，将军本人流着殷红的血在缠着绷带……，都是令人触目惊心的！“海之歌”在这点上给了我们教育：我们热爱和平，反对侵略战争。血的教训绝不能忘记，特别在我们进行和平建设、过着美好幸福生活的时候，我们要记住战争的灾害，并且警惕着！热爱祖国、人民和和平幸福生活的艺术家，在这里激情地歌颂了领导人民建设幸福生活的伟大组织者——苏联共产党，歌颂了新社会建设者的战胜一切的劳动，鼓舞了正建设着社会主义、共产主义的人们。
