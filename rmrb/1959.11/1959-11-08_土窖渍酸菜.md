Using earthen cellars to pickle cabbage in Heilongjiang, Liaoning, and other provinces is a good method for pickling large quantities of cabbage.

The earthen cellars for pickling cabbage are best located on flat ground with heavy clay soil or on higher ground, sheltered from the wind and facing the sun. The size of the cellar depends on the amount of cabbage to be pickled. Cellars can be either square or cylindrical. Generally, a cellar that is five meters long, three meters wide, and three meters deep can pickle 20,000 jin of cabbage. The cellar lid is the same as an ordinary vegetable cellar. Cover the wooden supports and sorghum stalks with 25-30 centimeters of wheat straw or wheat husks, and then add 30 centimeters of fine soil, enough to prevent freezing. A door should be left in the upper corner of the cellar for access.

After the cabbage is harvested, it should be dried in the field for two or three days, then transported to the vicinity of the cellar. Remove all roots, soil, and yellow or damaged leaves. At the same time, prepare several large pots near the cellar and heat water (generally at a temperature of about 80 degrees Celsius). Boil the trimmed cabbage for three to four minutes until it becomes soft, then remove it and let it cool slightly before putting it into the cellar.

Before putting the cabbage into the cellar, first lay a layer of sorghum stalks at the bottom of the cellar, and also erect a layer of bundled sorghum stalks around the perimeter. Place the cabbage one head after another, tightly packed without leaving any space, packing and pressing firmly as you go, up to 80 centimeters from the cellar lid. Cover the cabbage with sorghum stalks or bark, and then weigh it down with stones.

A thermometer should be placed inside the cellar. After the cabbage is put into the cellar, add warm water to cover the top of the cabbage, and close the cellar door to prevent cold air from entering. The temperature inside the cellar should generally be maintained at around 7-8 degrees Celsius. Check it once every two or three days. If the fermentation is good, add some cold water to lower the temperature inside the cellar to around 3-4 degrees Celsius. After the cabbage has fermented, check it regularly to ensure it does not lack water and remains unfrozen. After about 30 days, the cabbage will become pickled cabbage.

This method of pickling cabbage can be adopted by vegetable supply departments and public canteens of communes.

    土窖渍酸菜
    黑龙江、辽宁等省利用土窖渍酸菜，是大量渍制酸菜的一个好办法。
    渍菜的土窖最好选在土质粘重的平地或高一点的地方，背风向阳。窖的大小根据渍菜多少而定。窖形分方形和圆筒形两种。一般挖一个长五米、宽三米、深三米的窖，就可渍白菜两万斤。窖盖与普通菜窖一样，在元木与秫秸棚上，复盖二十五—三十厘米厚的麦秸或麦壳，再加三十厘米厚的细土，能够防冻即可。窖的一角上方应留一个门，以便出入。
    白菜收获以后，在田间晾晒三两天，运到菜窖附近，把根、土以及黄乱叶等全部除掉；同时，在窖旁准备几口大锅，烧好热水（温度一般在摄氏八十度左右），将修好的菜煮三、四分钟呈柔软状态时取出，稍凉一下就可入窖。
    在入窖之前，要先在窖底铺一层秫秸，周围也竖立一层成捆的秫秸。入窖的菜一棵接一棵排好，不留空间，随码随踩实，码到距窖盖八十厘米为止。白菜上面要用秫秸或板皮排好，再用石头压实。
    窖内应设有温度计。白菜入窖后，要加温水盖过菜顶，盖好窖门别让冷气侵入。窖内温度一般要保持在摄氏七、八度左右。两三天后要检查一次。如果发酵程度好，可加些凉水，使窖内温度降到摄氏三、四度左右。白菜发酵以后还要经常检查，不要缺少水，并保持不冻。经过三十天左右，白菜就变成酸菜了。
    这种渍酸菜的方法，蔬菜供应部门和公社的公共食堂都可以采用。
