How We Accelerated the Pace of Basic Construction
Liu Jian, Deputy Director of the Basic Construction Committee of the Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee

Under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and under the brilliant illumination of the Party's general line for socialist construction, Zhejiang Province's basic construction this year has achieved brilliant successes of continued leap forward on the basis of last year's Great Leap Forward. Especially since early August, following the instructions of the Party Central Committee, we have been opposing rightism, boosting morale, and vigorously carrying out the movement to increase production and practice economy. The broad masses of cadres and people are even more high-spirited and full of fighting spirit, and a new upsurge has quickly emerged on the basic construction front. The total amount of construction work completed in the province in the third quarter increased by 47.7% compared with the second quarter, and in September it increased by 46.9% compared with August. At present, the proportion of the total amount of basic construction work completed in the province to the annual plan is greater than ever before in the province's history.

The accelerated progress of key projects and the increasingly significant economic effects of basic construction are prominent features of the new upsurge. In mid-August, following the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee, we successively identified forty major individual projects in the industrial sector as the main goals of basic construction in the third quarter. By the end of September, the industrial system of the province had completed fifty important individual projects, greatly exceeding the planned requirements. The completion of these projects has not only greatly increased Zhejiang's industrial production capacity but also opened up new industrial fields. For example, "native methods" for coking, "native methods" for sugar refining, and sulfuric acid are newly added industrial sectors; the newly added capacity of steel, steel materials, coal, cement, and caustic soda is more than double the newly added capacity in the first half of the year; and the production capacity of electricity, crude salt, and cotton yarn has also greatly increased. This is of great significance for ensuring the completion and overfulfillment of the province's industrial production plan this year, improving the province's industrial technical level, promoting the development of industrial and agricultural production in the future, and further improving the people's lives.

Since the beginning of August, under the leadership of the Provincial Party Committee, we have gained some preliminary experience in opposing rightism, boosting morale, and organizing a new upsurge in basic construction. To sum up, there are three points:

Rectification Generates Enthusiasm, Enthusiasm Generates High Output

Adhering to putting politics in command and resolutely implementing the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, greatly destroying right-leaning ideas, and greatly boosting revolutionary enthusiasm are the primary keys to ensuring that more factories and mines and workshops are put into production.

In June and July this year, just as we were advancing victoriously on the basis of the continued leap forward in the first half of the year and striving for greater victories in the second half of the year, a few cadres developed right-leaning ideas and emotions, and a small handful of right-leaning opportunists even launched malicious attacks on the Party's general line. They exaggerated certain temporary and partial shortcomings in basic construction, negated the great achievements of basic construction, and denied the Great Leap Forward in basic construction. Due to the adverse effects spread by right-leaning opportunists, the speed of continued leap forward in basic construction was affected to a certain extent, and the amount of basic construction work completed in the province in July decreased compared with June.

According to the instructions of the Central Committee and the Provincial Party Committee on opposing rightism and boosting morale, since August we have thoroughly and seriously criticized the right-leaning ideas of a few cadres in various systems and units, and launched a resolute struggle against right-leaning opportunists. In addition to refuting the fallacies of right-leaning opportunists attacking the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes, we also firmly grasped the fallacies of right-leaning opportunists regarding basic construction and thoroughly criticized them. We used ironclad facts to refute the right-leaning fallacies that Zhejiang "has no iron," "has no coal," "has no large mines," and that Zhejiang's construction, steel, coal industries, and geological undertakings "have no future." We thoroughly criticized the fallacies of right-leaning opportunists who opposed high-speed construction. We deeply criticized various erroneous statements of right-leaning opportunists who opposed putting politics in command and opposed vigorously carrying out mass movements. In addition, we also conducted serious criticism of a small number of serious bourgeois individualists who were preoccupied with status and treatment all day long.

Because we criticized the errors of right-leaning opportunism ideologically, theoretically, and factually, and repelled the bourgeois anti-socialist trend of thought, the broad masses of cadres and people greatly enhanced their socialist consciousness. On this basis, a new upsurge of overall leap forward, rising in a straight line, emerged on the basic construction front. Due to the high morale of the workers, and due to the further promotion of the construction methods of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results that had proven effective since the Great Leap Forward, the industrial and non-industrial systems of the province completed eighty individual projects ahead of schedule in August and September, more than doubling the number completed in the first half of the year.

Mass Movements Ensure Greater, Faster, Better, and More Economical Results

Under the leadership of the Party, vigorously carrying out mass movements and launching socialist labor emulation campaigns centered on technical innovation and technical revolution to compare with, learn from, catch up with, and help the advanced is the decisive factor in ensuring the early and over-fulfillment of tasks. The characteristics of this mass movement are: clear goals, fierce momentum, comprehensive content, and diverse forms. In various systems and construction sites, hook-up competitions, face-to-face competitions, "one-dragon" competitions, pacesetter competitions, chain competitions, etc., were in full swing, and 99% of the workers were involved in this upsurge. The broad masses of workers displayed a communist spirit in the competition. A large number of advanced units and advanced figures emerged in the competition.

How was this movement carried out?

Talking extensively about the situation, talking extensively about achievements, talking extensively about tasks, and greatly boosting morale. From August onwards, we conscientiously conveyed and publicized the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party to the broad masses of workers, and carried out education on the general line and socialism. At the same time, construction, construction, design, and other units all assigned tasks to each individual. This combined vivid political education with work tasks, integrating situation, tasks, ideology, and work into one. The consciousness of every worker was raised, and morale was even higher. Kong Xian'gao, a bamboo worker at the Jiangshan Cement Plant construction site, said well: "Oppose rightism, boost morale, and after the tasks are lined up, the work of five people can be done by three people, and everyone is more and more energetic."

Leaders go to the front line, participate in labor, and solve problems. The main cadres of many units went deep into the site, grasped key projects, and worked with the shifts. For example, Sun Ziqing, deputy manager of Changguang Coal Mine Company, was transferred to the Niutoushan mining area to serve as the secretary of the general branch and mine manager. He found that the efficiency of roadway hoisting was very low, and immediately convened a "Zhuge Liang Meeting" to study the problem. Three days later, all the problems were solved, and the hoisting efficiency rapidly increased by 30%. Cadres' participation in labor on the front line also encouraged workers to improve their production enthusiasm.

Planting red flags, establishing pacesetters, grasping both ends and leading the middle, and widely carrying out socialist labor emulation campaigns to compare with, learn from, catch up with, and help the backward. The Fuchunjiang Hydropower Engineering Bureau established one hundred and five class and team pacesetters in the competition, summarized and widely publicized their advanced deeds and advanced experience; at the same time, they helped the backward and encouraged them to catch up with the advanced, and the production efficiency of the broad masses of workers improved. The labor emulation competition in the province's basic construction departments was rich in content and large in scale. The main forms were hook-up competitions between construction sites and class teams and "one-dragon" collaboration competitions; between enterprises, there were inter-factory competitions and hook-up competitions of the same types of work.

The "one-dragon" collaboration competition is a characteristic of the socialist labor emulation competition in our province. This competition is a competition between classes (three shifts, morning, middle, and evening) on a single work line of different types of work, or a collaboration competition between the upper and lower processes on a single work line. The "one-dragon" competition must be based on the class team competition. Its main advantages are: it can organize the production of each process, it is suitable for the characteristics of multi-work type joint operations in basic construction, it is suitable for the requirements of rapid construction, it is conducive to promoting collectivist ideology, strengthening mutual collaboration and mutual promotion between various types of work, it is conducive to in-depth development of technical innovation and technical revolution, it is conducive to better combining centralized leadership and vigorous mass movements, and it is conducive to mobilizing the masses to better complete tasks.

Combining hard work, practical work, and skillful work, and guiding the masses' soaring enthusiasm to technical innovation. During the construction of the auditorium of the Hangzhou Hotel, Wang A'san, the plasterer foreman, made a stone-chopping brush out of iron wire to chop artificial stone, increasing efficiency by twenty times; He Yuchang, a plasterer, created a hand-cranked tile punching machine, increasing efficiency by ten times; Wang Zhongfa, an electrician, created an electric marble saw, increasing efficiency by dozens of times.

Concentrate Superior Forces to Win a Decisive Victory

Formulating a good combat plan, clarifying combat goals, and strengthening specific leadership are important measures to accelerate the progress of basic construction. Since August, we have explored some effective methods in the organizational leadership of basic construction.

Rank the projects and launch concentrated assaults in batches. In order to accelerate the speed of construction, the Provincial Party Committee analyzed the situation and conditions of basic construction in the province, and in the seven industrial sectors of metallurgy, machinery, electric power, chemical industry, coal, and light industry, it scheduled forty major projects that must be completed and put into production before National Day as the central goals of the battle. Subsequently, in the non-industrial systems of agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, culture, education, health, commerce, and food, thirty important individual projects that must be completed and delivered for use before National Day were scheduled. In this way, the overall struggle goal was clarified. All departments were urgently mobilized for the completion of this batch of projects. By National Day, the thirty individual projects of the non-industrial system had been completed and delivered for use, and the industrial system had completed fifty major individual projects ahead of schedule. Experience has proved that this approach can concentrate superior manpower and material resources to fight annihilation battles, which meets the requirements of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results, striving for more factories and mines and workshops to be put into production, and rapidly bringing into play the investment effect.

Clarify goals, reverse schedule, the purpose of basic construction is to increase production capacity, and every construction project should, in the spirit of boosting morale and striving for upstream, clearly stipulate the date of completion acceptance and putting into production according to production needs and design, equipment, construction forces, production preparation and other conditions, and then reverse the schedule, and strive to complete and put into production as soon as possible. First, this can clarify the overall direction of struggle for construction units, design units, construction units, equipment manufacturing, transportation and other departments related to this project, and facilitate the mobilization of workers to fight for a unified goal. Secondly, it is convenient to tap production potential, find problems, and spur leaders at all levels to take effective measures to solve them. Clarifying the requirements for putting into production and taking putting into production as the primary indicator for checking work can enable all aspects to establish a production viewpoint and fundamentally overcome the bad tendency of some construction units to unilaterally pursue output value and ignore finishing work.

Find problems and solve them within a time limit. The Provincial Party Committee often educates us: we must have the spirit of revolutionary "officialism," and we must promptly handle major and specific work problems on a daily basis. It is wrong to talk about principles in a vacuum, only care about "big things," not solve specific problems, and be unwilling to handle "small things." After clarifying goals and scheduling plans, a series of problems that need to be solved will inevitably be discovered. These problems can generally be divided into five categories: design, materials, equipment, construction, and production preparation, and it is necessary to organize the forces of all aspects and mobilize the enthusiasm of all aspects to solve them. The process of basic construction is also the process of solving these problems. For example, in order to complete major individual projects before National Day, we first found nineteen design problems, and the Provincial Basic Construction Committee convened relevant design departments to take measures such as on-site design to solve them in a timely manner; the lack of some steel and wood was solved by urging delivery, adjusting, clearing warehouses, using substitutes, etc.

When solving these problems, we adopted the method of assigning special personnel to be responsible for handling them within a time limit. Each specific work is handled by special personnel responsible for it, and there are specific requirements, and it is handled within a time limit in accordance with the regulations. This method can speed up the speed of solving problems and is conducive to improving project quality.

Close collaboration and unified leadership. Basic construction is a collective creation of multiple units, and must be completed through the joint efforts of construction units, design units, construction units, and related equipment manufacturing units, transportation and other departments. Therefore, at the construction site, it is necessary to organize the basic construction headquarters under the unified leadership of the factory Party committee, twist the forces of all aspects into one rope, uniformly arrange tasks, uniformly allocate manpower and material resources, and take consistent actions. Under the leadership of the Provincial Party Committee, the Prefectural Party Committees and the Municipal Party Committees, the basic construction work of the province, municipalities and prefectures is organized by the Basic Construction Committee in a unified manner, to ensure the realization of the basic construction plan determined by the Provincial Party Committee. In addition to organizing various business departments to grasp basic construction, we also organized material departments, transportation departments, labor departments, newspapers and broadcasting departments, etc., to actively act to ensure the realization of the basic construction plan. Facts have proved that the armies of all routes on the basic construction front can carry out construction faster, better, and more economically only under the unified leadership of the Party Committee, acting in unison and collaborating closely.

On the basis of the major victories that have already been achieved, the broad masses of workers on the basic construction front of our province are, under the leadership of the Provincial Party Committee, holding high the red flag of the general line, boosting their morale, striving for upstream, and striving to comprehensively complete and over-fulfill this year's plan to increase production and practice economy, and working hard to prepare for the continued leap forward next year.

    我们怎样加快了基本建设速度
    中共浙江省委基本建设委员会副主任　刘剑
    在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，浙江省今年的基本建设，在去年大跃进的基础上，又取得了继续跃进的辉煌成就。特别是8月初根据党中央的指示，反右倾，鼓干劲，大力开展增产节约运动以来，广大干部、群众更加意气风发，斗志昂扬，基本建设战线很快出现了新高潮。全省第三季度完成的建筑工作量比第二季度增长了47.7％，9月份比8月份增长46.9％。目前，全省完成的基本建设工作总量占全年计划的比重之大，是本省历年来没有过的。
    重点工程进度加快，基本建设的经济效果日益显著，这是新高潮的一个突出的特点。8月中旬，我们根据省委指示，在工业部门先后排出四十个重大的单项工程，作为第三季度基本建设的主要目标。到9月底，全省工业系统就建成五十项重要的单项工程，大大超过了计划要求。这些工程的建成，使浙江工业不仅大大地增添了新的生产能力，而且开辟了新的工业领域，例如“洋法”炼焦、“洋法”制糖、硫酸等是新增的工业部门；钢、钢材、煤炭、水泥、烧碱的新增能力都比今年上半年新增能力多一倍以上；电、原盐、棉纱的生产能力也有很大的增长。这对保证完成和超额完成今年全省的工业生产计划，提高本省工业技术水平，促进今后工农业生产的发展和进一步改善人民生活，都有重大意义。
    8月初以来，我们在省委的领导下，在反右倾、鼓干劲、组织基本建设新高潮的工作中，初步取得了一些经验。概括起来，有以下三点。
    整风出干劲　干劲出高产
    坚持政治挂帅，坚决贯彻执行党的八届八中全会的决议，大破右倾思想，大鼓革命干劲，是保证更多厂矿、车间投入生产的首要关键。
    今年6、7月间，正当我们在上半年继续跃进的基础上乘胜前进，争取下半年更大胜利的时候，少数干部滋长了右倾思想和右倾情绪，一小撮右倾机会主义分子更对党的总路线进行恶毒的攻击。他们夸大基本建设中某些暂时的局部的缺点，抹煞基本建设的巨大成绩，否定基本建设的大跃进。由于右倾机会主义分子所散布的恶劣影响，在一定程度上影响了基本建设继续跃进的速度，7月份全省完成的基本建设工作量比6月份有所下降。
    根据中央和省委关于反右倾、鼓干劲的指示，我们从8月份以来在各系统各单位彻底地、严肃地批判了少数干部的右倾思想，并对右倾机会主义分子展开了坚决的斗争。我们除驳倒了右倾机会主义分子攻击总路线、大跃进和人民公社的谬论以外，还紧紧抓住右倾机会主义分子对于基本建设的谬论予以彻底批判。我们用铁的事实驳倒了浙江“无铁”、“无煤”、“无大矿”以及浙江建筑、钢铁、煤炭工业和地质事业“无前途”等右倾谰言。我们彻底批判了右倾机会主义分子反对高速度进行建设的谬论。我们深入批判了右倾机会主义分子反对政治挂帅、反对大搞群众运动的各种错误言论。另外，我们还对少数终日闹地位、闹待遇的严重的资产阶级个人主义者进行了严肃的批判。
    由于我们从思想上、理论上、事实上批判了右倾机会主义的错误，打退了资产阶级反社会主义的思潮，广大干部和群众都大大提高了社会主义觉悟。在这一基础上，基本建设战线出现了直线上升的全面跃进的新高潮。由于职工群众斗志昂扬，由于进一步推广了大跃进以来证明行之有效的多快好省的施工方法，全省工业系统和非工业系统在8、9两月超计划建成了八十个单项工程，比上半年完工数量增加一倍多。
    群众运动保证多快好省
    在党的领导下大搞群众运动，开展以技术革新和技术革命为中心的比先进、学先进、赶先进、帮落后的社会主义劳动竞赛运动，这是保证提前和超额完成任务的决定因素。这次群众运动的特点是：目标明确，来势猛烈，内容全面，形式多样。在各系统、各工地，挂钩赛、面对面赛、“一条龙”赛、标兵赛、连环赛等，搞得热火朝天，99％的职工都卷入了这一浪潮。广大职工在竞赛中发扬了共产主义风格。竞赛中涌现出大批先进单位和先进人物。
    这次的运动是怎样开展的呢？
    大讲形势，大讲成绩，大讲任务，大鼓干劲。从8月份起，我们认真地向广大职工传达和宣传了党的八届八中全会决议，开展了总路线和社会主义教育。与此同时，建设、施工、设计等单位都把任务交到每一个人。这就把生动的政治教育和工作任务结合起来，形势、任务、思想、工作融成一体。每个职工的觉悟都提高了，干劲更足了。江山水泥厂工地竹工孔显高说得好：“反右倾，鼓干劲，任务排队以后，五个人的活，三个人能干，大家越干越有劲。”
    领导亲临前线，参加劳动，解决问题。许多单位的主要干部都深入现场，掌握重点工程，跟班劳动。例如，长广煤矿公司副经理孙子青下放到牛头山矿区担任总支书记兼矿长，发现巷道提升效率很低，随即召开“诸葛亮会”研究，三天后问题全部解决，提升效率迅速提高30％。干部亲临前线参加劳动，也鼓舞工人提高了生产积极性。
    插红旗，立标兵，抓两头带中间，广泛开展比先进、学先进、赶先进、帮后进的社会主义劳动竞赛。富春江水电工程局在竞赛中立了一百零五个班组标兵，总结和广泛宣传了他们的先进事迹和先进经验；同时，帮助后进，鼓舞他们赶上先进，广大工人的生产效率有了提高。全省基本建设部门的劳动竞赛内容丰富，声势浩大。主要形势是工地之间和班组之间的挂钩竞赛和“一条龙”协作竞赛；企业之间是厂际竞赛和同工种挂钩竞赛。
    “一条龙”协作竞赛，是目前我省社会主义劳动竞赛的一个特色。这种竞赛是不同工种在一条作业线上开展班与班之间（早中晚三班）的竞赛，或者是一条作业线上的上下工序之间开展协作竞赛。“一条龙”竞赛必须以班组竞赛为基础。它的主要好处是：可以把各道工序的生产组织起来，它适合基本建设多工种联合作业的特点，适合快速施工的要求，有利于发扬集体主义思想，加强各工种之间的相互协作，相互促进，有利于技术革新和技术革命深入开展，有利于集中领导和大搞群众运动更好地结合，有利于发动群众更好地完成任务。
    苦干、实干和巧干相结合，把群众冲天干劲引导到技术革新上去。杭州饭店大礼堂施工过程中，泥工工长王阿三用铁丝制成了斩石刷来斩假石，提高工效二十倍；泥工何玉昌创造手摇瓷砖打眼机，提高工效十倍；电工王忠法创造电动大理石锯，提高工效几十倍。
    集中优势力量一战而胜
    订好作战计划，明确战斗目标，加强具体领导，是加快基本建设进度的重要措施。8月份以来，我们在基本建设的组织领导方面，摸索到了下列一些行之有效的做法。
    工程排队，分批突击。为了加快建设速度，省委分析了全省基本建设的情况和条件，在冶金、机械、电力、化工、煤炭、轻工等七个工业部门中，排定了国庆节前必须竣工投入生产的四十项重大工程，作为战斗的中心目标。随后又在农、林、水利、文化、教育、卫生、商业、粮食等非工业系统中，排出三十项必须在国庆节前建成交付使用的重要单项工程。这样，就明确了总的奋斗目标。各部门都为这批工程的完成而紧急动员起来。到国庆节，非工业系统的三十项单项工程都建成交付使用了，工业系统超计划建成了五十项重大单项工程。经验证明，这种做法能够集中优势人力、物力打歼灭战，是符合多快好省、力争更多厂矿车间投入生产、迅速发挥投资效果的要求的。
    明确目标，计划倒排，基本建设的目的是为了增加生产能力，每项建设工程都应本着鼓足干劲、力争上游的精神，根据生产需要和设计、设备、施工力量、生产准备等条件，明确规定交工验收、投入生产的日期，然后倒排计划，争取早日建成投入生产。这样，首先可以使与这一工程有关的建设单位、设计单位、施工单位和设备制造、交通运输等部门明确总的奋斗方向，便于动员职工为统一的目标战斗。其次，便于挖掘生产潜力，找出问题，鞭策各级领导采取有力措施予以解决。明确投入生产的要求，把投入生产作为检查工作的首要指标，可以使各个方面树立生产观点，从根本上克服某些施工单位片面追求产值、忽视扫尾工程的不良倾向。
    找出问题，限期解决。省委经常教育我们：要有革命的“事务主义”的精神，要及时处理日常的重大的具体工作问题。空谈原则，只管“大事”，不解决具体问题，不愿办“小事”是不对的。在明确目标、排定计划以后，必然会发现一系列要解决的问题。这些问题一般可以分为设计、材料、设备、施工、生产准备五大类，必须组织各方面力量，调动各方面的积极性加以解决。基本建设的过程，也就是解决这些问题的过程。例如，国庆节前为了突击完成重大单项工程，我们首先找出了十九个设计问题，由省基本建设委员会召集有关设计部门采取现场设计等办法及时加以解决；缺少部分钢材和木材，便通过催货、调剂、清理仓库、代用等办法加以解决……。
    在解决这些问题时，我们采取了专人负责，限期办好的办法。每一项具体工作都有专人负责去办，而且都有具体要求，按照规定，限期办好。这种方法可以加快解决问题的速度，而且有利于提高工程质量。
    密切协作，统一领导。基本建设是一个多单位的集体创作，必须有建设单位、设计单位、施工单位以及有关的设备制造单位、交通运输等部门的共同努力，才能完成。因此，在建设工地必须在工厂党委的统一领导下，组织基本建设指挥部，把各方面力量拧成一股绳，统一布置任务，统一调配人力物力，采取一致行动。省、市、专区的基本建设工作，在省委、地委和市委的领导下，由基本建设委员会统一组织各方面的力量，保证实现省委确定的基本建设计划。除了组织各业务厅抓紧基本建设以外，还组织物资部门、交通运输部门、劳动部门、报刊广播部门等，为保证实现基本建设计划而积极行动。事实证明，基本建设战线的各路大军在党委统一领导下，一致行动，密切协作，才能多快好省地进行建设。
    在已经取得的重大胜利的基础上，我省基本建设战线上的广大职工，正在省委的领导下，高举总路线的红旗，鼓足干劲，力争上游，为全面提前和超额完成今年的增产节约计划，为给明年的继续跃进作好准备而努力奋斗。
