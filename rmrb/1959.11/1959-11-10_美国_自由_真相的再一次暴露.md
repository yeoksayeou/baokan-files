    Another Exposure of the Truth about American "Freedom"
    By a Commentator of this Newspaper
    The 500,000 American steelworkers were forced to resume work on November 7 due to the coercion of the US government and the US Supreme Court after a 116-day long strike. Although the strike has been forced to an end, and although the workers have not achieved their predetermined goal of increasing wages, this steel strike, the longest in American history, has important significance. It vividly demonstrates the fighting power of American steelworkers and the strong solidarity of the American working class in the struggle for their own rights. It also powerfully exposes the falsity of the American bourgeoisie's "democracy and freedom" and the myth of the so-called "supra-class" and "welfare state" fabricated by apologists for modern capitalism.
    This American steelworkers' strike began on July 15 this year. Long before the strike, labor and management in the steel industry had held long-term negotiations for the signing of a new contract. In the negotiations, the steelworkers put forward reasonable demands, such as an average wage increase of 30 cents per hour, reduced working hours without reduced wages, and increased unemployment benefits and pensions. However, the steel monopoly capitalists, whose profits are growing, not only rejected these demands of the steelworkers, but also attempted to stipulate harsh conditions in the new contract to further strengthen exploitation and weaken workers' rights. In order to reduce steel stockpiles and raise steel prices, they even deliberately forced the steelworkers to strike, attempting to use this to strike at the organized strength of the steelworkers and then use the threat of starvation to force the workers to surrender. But the American steelworkers not only resolutely held a strike, but also persisted unexpectedly, not succumbing to the threats and inducements of the capitalists. What is particularly valuable is that in this struggle, the American working class demonstrated strong solidarity. The steelworkers' strike received strong support from coal miners, auto workers, construction workers, and dockworkers. While they persisted in their strike, hundreds of thousands of workers in copper mining, shipbuilding, packaging, seafaring, textiles, and other sectors also held strikes to fight for improved living conditions.
    This steel strike has already dealt a powerful blow to American monopoly capital. The American steel capitalists, who originally relied on their invulnerability, attempted to force the steelworkers to further submit through the strike, but the result was the opposite. Due to the nearly four-month strike, the twelve American steel companies affected by the strike have already lost $5 billion in operating income. Many monopoly capital enterprises related to steel production have also suffered losses to varying degrees. The large stockpiles of steel accumulated by many American companies before the strike are about to be exhausted. Even if work resumes now, it will take at least thirty to forty days for steel production to fully recover, and it will take half a year to replenish the current inventory. This strike has also had a certain impact on the US government's plans for expanding armaments and preparing for war. If the steelworkers have not achieved final success due to being forced to resume work, then American monopoly capital and their agents are by no means the victors.
    It is precisely because this steel strike has hit the interests of American monopoly capital and the American ruling group that the US government had to "show its true colors" and tear off the mask of bourgeois "democracy and freedom," finally adopting high-pressure measures to force the striking workers to resume work. People still clearly remember that when this steel strike began not long ago, US President Eisenhower boasted at a press conference in August that the strike was a manifestation of America's "free democracy." But when the monopoly capitalists' predetermined conspiracy failed, losses grew larger and larger, and they repeatedly appealed to the US government for emergency assistance, Eisenhower finally wielded the big stick, using the excuse of "endangering the health and safety of the nation" to demand that the judicial organs trot out the reactionary Taft-Hartley Act to suppress the strike struggle. This fact clearly tells American workers that Eisenhower and his government are by no means representatives of the will and interests of all American citizens, but rather the faithful agents of American monopoly capital. The "democracy and freedom" touted by the United States is simply a deception. The "freedom" safeguarded by the US government and US judiciary is only the "freedom" of a small number of financial tycoons to intensify their cruel exploitation and extract high profits, while the vast working class, who sell their labor, do not even have the "freedom" to demand a 30-cent wage increase! When monopoly capital believes that a strike is beneficial to them, the "freedom" to strike can be allowed; but when this "freedom" endangers the interests of monopoly capital, it must be taken away! This is the truth about American "freedom."

    美国“自由”真相的再一次暴露
    本报评论员
    美国五十万钢铁工人坚持了一百一十六天的大罢工，由于受到美国政府和美国最高法院命令的强制，在11月7日被迫复工。尽管罢工被迫告一段落，尽管工人还没有达到要求增加工资的预定目的，但是，这次在美国历史上时间最长的钢铁大罢工，具有着重要的意义。它生动地显示了美国钢铁工人的战斗力量和美国工人阶级在争取自身权利斗争中的坚强团结，而且也有力地戳穿了美国资产阶级“民主自由”的虚妄性和现代资本主义辩护士捏造的所谓“超阶级”“福利国家”之类的神话。
    这次美国钢铁工人大罢工是从今年7月15日开始的。早在罢工之前，钢铁工业的劳资双方曾经为签订新的合同而举行过长期的谈判。钢铁工人在谈判中，提出了每小时平均工资增加三角美元；减少工时但不减少工资和增加失业补助金、养老金等合理要求。但是利润越滚越大的钢铁垄断资本家，不但拒绝钢铁工人的这些要求，反而企图在新的合同中规定进一步加强剥削和削弱工人权利的苛刻条件。为了减少钢铁存货、抬高钢铁价格，他们甚至还有意迫使钢铁工人罢工，企图借此打击钢铁工人的有组织力量，然后再用饥饿的威胁来迫使工人投降。但是美国钢铁工人不仅坚决地举行了罢工，而且出乎资本家意料地坚持了下来，没有对资方的威迫利诱屈服。特别可贵的是，在这一次斗争中，美国工人阶级表现了坚强的团结。钢铁工人的大罢工，得到了煤矿工人、汽车工人、建筑工人和码头工人的有力声援。在他们坚持罢工的同时，铜矿、造船、包装、海员、纺织等部门的十几万工人也曾举行了争取改善生活的罢工斗争。
    这次钢铁罢工已经给美国垄断资本一个有力的打击。原来自恃无恐的美国钢铁资本家企图通过罢工来迫使钢铁工人进一步就范，结果却是适得其反。由于将近四个月的罢工，受到罢工影响的十二家美国钢铁公司已经损失了五十亿美元的营业收入。许多与钢铁生产有关的垄断资本企业也受到不同程度的损失。美国许多公司在罢工之前大量屯积起来的钢铁存货已快要耗尽。即使现在复工，钢铁生产也至少要经过三、四十天才能全面恢复，而要充实现在的库存则非要半年之后办不到。这次罢工也给美国政府的扩军备战计划以一定的影响。如果说钢铁工人由于被迫复工而尚未取得最后成功的话，那么美国垄断资本和它们的代理人也决不是胜利者。
    正是因为这次钢铁大罢工打击了美国垄断资本和美国统治集团的利益，美国政府才不得不“图穷匕现”，撕破资产阶级“民主自由”的假面具，在最后对罢工工人采取强迫复工的高压手段。人们还清楚记得，当这次钢铁罢工开始不久时，美国总统艾森豪威尔曾经在8月间的一次记者招待会上吹嘘这次罢工是美国的“自由民主”的表现。但是当垄断资本的预定的阴谋破产、亏损越来越大而向美国政府一再告急求援的时候，艾森豪威尔终于抡起大棒，以所谓“危及国家的健康与安全”为借口，要求司法机关搬出反动的塔夫脱—哈特莱法来镇压这次罢工斗争了。这个事实清楚地告诉美国工人，艾森豪威尔和他的政府，根本不是什么美国全体公民的意志和利益的代表者，而是美国垄断资本的忠实的代理人。美国所标榜的“民主自由”根本就是骗人的。美国政府和美国司法所维护的“自由”，只是一小撮财阀们加紧残酷剥削、榨取高额利润的“自由”，而出卖自己劳力的广大工人阶级，则连要求增加三角钱工资的“自由”也没有！当垄断资本认为罢工对他们有利的时候，罢工的“自由”是可以允许的；但是当这种“自由”危害到垄断资本利益的时候，就必须加以剥夺！这就是美国“自由”的真相。
