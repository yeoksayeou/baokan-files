    The Great Changes in Slovakia
    Wang Guang
    In Prague, Czech comrades repeatedly mentioned the tremendous changes in Slovakia. They proudly said, "Slovakia's leap forward is a great victory for the Marxist-Leninist policy on nationalities, and an example of an underdeveloped nation moving towards prosperity and happiness." After traveling around Slovakia for a week, these simple words once again surfaced in my mind. They are not an exaggeration; they succinctly summarize our impressions, and they have become our own language.
    Earth-shaking Changes
    Slovakia used to be an economically backward agricultural region. Twenty years ago, the value of industrial and agricultural output was 36 to 64, but by 1958, this ratio had completely reversed, becoming 70 to 30. Before liberation, the number of Slovak farmers was 119 times greater than the number of landlords, but they owned one-third less land than the landlords. By 1958, the landlord class had long been overthrown, and all the farmers had been allocated land, with 67% of the arable land having joined cooperatives. The value of agricultural output also increased by one-third compared to before liberation. Compared with the pre-war period, Slovakia used to have only one institution of higher learning, but now it has twelve. Previously, there was one university student for every two thousand people; now there are eight. In the past, there were fewer than two hundred cinemas; now there are more than a thousand...
    Anyone without prejudice can see the brilliance of these figures. However, just these few lines of figures—even many times more—are far from sufficient to explain the great changes in Slovakia. The reason is that behind these increasing and surging numbers, Slovakia's entire history, the material and spiritual life of the Slovak people, and the relations between the Slovak people and the Czech people, as well as with the people of surrounding countries, have undergone earth-shaking changes. All of this is difficult to express with numbers alone.
    The history of Slovakia is a history of suffering, and the Slovak people, especially the vast number of farmers, were the direct bearers of all the suffering. In the art gallery in Bratislava, the capital of Slovakia, we saw an oil painting: a farm boy of fourteen or fifteen years old, sitting blankly in front of a broken wall next to a broken jar. His clasped hands hung limply between his legs, and a pair of exhausted, listless eyes told of the suffering and accusations against the current poverty and the helpless fear of a wandering life abroad relying on mending broken jars for a living. The theme of this oil painting—the poverty and exile of farmers—is by no means isolated and accidental. According to statistics from 1933, 82% of peasant households were in debt that year, and many of them sold their property because they could not repay the debts. Under the threat of poverty and hunger, large numbers of farmers used to go abroad every year to earn a living. From 1850 to the eve of liberation, nearly 800,000 Slovaks were displaced abroad. That is to say, among more than three million Slovaks, one in every four was a wanderer. This was Slovakia's tragic past.
    Poverty and Backwardness Have Forever Disappeared
    The brand of backwardness and poverty that had existed for thousands of years has been washed away without a trace in the short fifteen years since liberation. In this fierce impact on a corner of the old world, countless emerging industrial enterprises and cooperativeized rural areas played a major role. According to the grand plan of the Czechoslovak Republic to build socialism, from 1949 to 1958, a total of 202 factories and 15 hydroelectric and thermal power stations were built in Slovakia. In addition, 140 factories were expanded and renovated. The first result of the emergence of this batch of factories was a significant increase in the employed population.
    Today, people no longer have to tighten their hungry stomachs to look for bread everywhere. On the contrary, relatives who had been exiled abroad returned to their hometowns one after another, and Czech brothers from the western regions also moved in batches to participate in construction projects. From 1948 to the end of 1956, the labor force in Slovakia increased by 370,000 people, which is equivalent to more than one-tenth of the total population. Increasing by one-tenth is indeed not a very large number. However, for the Slovak region, where the ledger for calculating labor force had always been marked with a negative sign, such a huge transformation can be said to be an amazing achievement. Within this one-tenth, how much hardship and joy are contained!
    The rapid development of industrial and agricultural cooperativization has ensured an unprecedented improvement in the material and cultural living standards of the people. Slovakia's per capita consumption level has increased by an average of more than 90% since 1949.
    This situation is particularly significant in rural areas. We visited the Sili Zi Unified Agricultural Cooperative in the suburbs of Bratislava. This cooperative was established in 1952, but its real consolidation and development began in 1955. In the recent five years, the total output value of the cooperative has increased nearly four times, and the income per work day has more than doubled. And the income of this cooperative is not even the highest in Slovakia. Comrades from the Slovak "Truth Daily" told us that in all of Slovakia, farm households with an annual income of 100,000 crowns account for about 10% to 12% of the total number of farm households. In such rural areas, who can still say that they remain a symbol of backwardness and poverty? Everyone has read the poem by the great Slovak poet Hviezdoslav, "Orava, Orava, how poor you are…", although its full text still retains its attractive beauty, the poverty it describes has disappeared forever. The huge tide of socialist construction has long submerged and buried the centuries of poverty and humiliation of the Orava people.
    Friendship as Close as Brothers
    Every giant step forward taken by the Slovak people is condensed with the brotherly friendship of their Czech brothers and the people of the Soviet Union and other countries. This friendship is the source of Slovakia's victory in national liberation and socialist construction, and it burns like fire in the hearts of future generations.
    This friendship was forged in the anti-fascist war. The heroic tomb on the small hill of Strichno on the banks of the Váh River is an ironclad proof. The Strichno hill is midway between Ruzdubilok and Zilina, and the "wandering" Váh River flows slowly at its foot. Between these mountains and rivers, there is a winding road that used to be the transportation channel of the German occupiers. On April 25, 1945, a guerrilla force composed of soldiers from four nationalities—Slovak, Czech, Russian, and French—launched an ambush on this road, intercepting a German tank unit reinforcing Prague. The fierce battle lasted for five days. The guerrillas held back the tail of the German army, saving hundreds of thousands of Prague residents from death.
    Less than a month after this fierce battle, the German fascists completely collapsed from this country, which was initially occupied and continued to resist stubbornly until the end. However, in this battle so close to the final victory, 608 comrades of different nationalities did not have time to share the joy of victory and sacrificed their lives. The Slovak people built a large cemetery here to express their gratitude to the "creators of happiness." Yes, in this heroic ranks, whether it is the eighteen-year-old Slovak youth Tribuna, or the twenty-two-year-old French girl Jeanne, or the Russian Moscowich couple; they are all people worthy of eternal respect and remembrance. It is not only that they lived greatly and died bravely; more importantly, the name of each of them is closely linked with the great spirit of internationalism.
    This friendship also radiates brilliant light in the construction process of Slovak farms and factories. We visited the "Slovak National Uprising Factory," which is a huge aluminum smelting factory. This factory attracts people's attention in all aspects: enterprise managers carefully examine its new equipment and complex refining process; purchasing agents from aluminum processing factories repeatedly appraise its high-quality products; historians study and record how it quickly and thoroughly changed the impoverished appearance of the ancient Ruyar village; and landscape painters can also find their themes here: a large basin surrounded by mountains and old forests, the Gran River rushing out from the green trees on both banks, and railways and highways like black and yellow giant belts extending parallel to the river bank. In the distance of this picture, at the foot of a mountain, rows of newly built factory buildings and neatly arranged chimneys vigorously break through the ancient and silent valley. This is that huge factory. And we also have a wish, which is to rush to listen to the hymn of friendship.
    The aluminum smelting factory only started construction in 1951, and produced the first batch of aluminum ingots on August 23, 1953. Each aluminum ingot gleaming with silver-white light is condensed with internationalist friendship. The design of the factory is the result of cooperation between Czech and Slovak engineers, and they also made full use of the technical data provided by Hungary and the Soviet Union. All the equipment is a product of many Czech machinery factories. In order to master this modern equipment and accurately adjust production, they received selfless help from Soviet experts. From 1956 to 1957, this factory also sent seventy engineers to study and visit in the Soviet Union. So far, Slovakia's aluminum ore is not enough to supply the needs of this factory. Where do the raw materials come from? Hungary is the only nearest supplier.
    Seeking Understanding and Friendship
    In Slovakia, we visited many new buildings, but the newest, greatest, and most eye-catching is the enthusiastic desire to seek mutual understanding and the precious feelings of friendship built in people's hearts.
    As soon as we got off the plane and set foot on the land of Bratislava, we were greeted by a strong Slovak girl. To our surprise, she spoke fluent Chinese. This girl, named Anna, is a graduate student in Oriental languages at the Slovak University. The Slovak Journalists Association asked her to accompany us, and we quickly became close companions and friends.
    In the eyes of Europeans, Chinese characters are the most difficult to learn, but how did Anna choose to study Chinese? She told us that around 1949 (that is, when she was just about fourteen years old), Czechoslovak newspapers and magazines introduced a lot about China. From the ancient culture of the East to the tremendous changes in New China, from the myths about dragons to the dreamlike victory of the Chinese people's revolution, from the beautiful performances of Chinese song and dance troupes to various novels depicting the lives of the Chinese people, all deeply attracted this girl. She longed to know more about China, so she made a wish to learn Chinese. And at school, in the process of performing the task assigned to her by the Youth League—helping Chinese students learn Czech—she also made several Chinese sisters. Their interaction further helped her overcome many difficulties in learning Chinese conversation. In this way, her wish was successfully realized.
    Anna is currently the only person in Slovakia who understands Chinese. She said, "My current task is to directly translate some Chinese books into Slovak." She has already translated and published a selected works of Yu Dafu; she is currently co-translating a selected works of Lu Xun with the Czech sinologist Kripshova; next year, she plans to publish Wu Yunduo's "Dedicate Everything to the Party"; the year after, she plans to finish translating Yang Mo's "Song of Youth."
    Translating the works of various countries is originally an important way to enhance mutual understanding. And direct contact between the people of various countries is even more conducive to enhancing mutual understanding and establishing lasting friendship. Slovakia has also made beneficial contributions in this regard. We visited the High Tatras, which is a famous scenic area and alpine sanatorium in Europe. The High Tatras straddle the border between the Czech and Polish countries. Here, it is truly a gathering place for international people. Polish, Swiss, Italian, and French travelers come here in groups every summer for vacation or recuperation. They cultivated friendship here, and then took the seeds of friendship back in their hearts.
    On the mountainside of the High Tatras, among the green trees, stands a three-story red building, with an elegant triangular balcony in front of each window. This is the famous "Children's Paradise." We visited this place by chance. Here, in addition to the Young Pioneers of Czechoslovakia, there are also children from several countries such as the United States, the Netherlands, Iceland, Denmark, and Hungary as summer guests. Different children have different habits; but all children like high mountains and lakes. The counselors of "Children's Paradise" also established good friendship among the children through various sports and recreational activities. Although this is just a life in a building, its significance far exceeds the scope of life itself. We firmly believe that in the victorious advance of the people of all countries, the life in this building will soon become the common life of the whole world.

    斯洛伐克的巨变
    王光
    在布拉格，捷克同志一再提起斯洛伐克的巨大变化。他们自豪地说：“斯洛伐克的飞跃发展，是马克思列宁主义民族政策的伟大胜利，也是不发达民族走向繁荣和幸福的一个范例”。在斯洛伐克绕行了一周以后，这些淳朴的字句再一次在脑海中泛了起来，它毫不夸张地、集中地概括了我们的观感；它已变成了我们自己的语言。
    天翻地覆的变化
    斯洛伐克曾经是一个经济落后的农业区。二十年前，工业和农业的产值是三十六比六十四，而到1958年，这个比数整整翻了过来，变成了七十比三十。解放以前，斯洛伐克农民的人数比地主多一百一十九倍，他们的土地却比地主少三分之一，而到1958年，地主阶级早已打倒了，农民统统分到了土地，其中67％的耕地已经加入了合作社；农业的产值也比解放前增长了三分之一。同战争以前作比较，斯洛伐克过去只有一所高等学校，而现在有了十二所；过去平均两千人中才有一个大学生，现在有了八个；过去只有不到两百个电影院，现在有了一千多个……。
    只要没有偏见，谁都可以看到这些数字闪烁着的光辉。但是，只是这几行数字——甚至比它再多上几倍，也还远远不能说明斯洛伐克的巨变。原因是在这些增减翻腾的数字后面，斯洛伐克的全部历史、斯洛伐克人民的物质生活和精神面貌、斯洛伐克族同捷克族以及同周围国家人民的关系都发生了天翻地覆的变化，而这一切，只凭数字是难以表达的。
    斯洛伐克的历史是一部苦难的历史，斯洛伐克人民、特别是广大农民又是一切苦难的直接承担者。在斯洛伐克首府布拉迪斯拉发的美术馆里，我们看到一幅油画：一个十四、五岁的农家孩子，呆呆地坐在半堵破墙前面的一只破罐子旁边。扣着的双手软绵绵地垂放在两腿之间，一对疲乏不堪的失神的眼睛，诉说着对眼前贫困生活的苦难的控诉，和对即将出亡国外靠补破罐子活命的流浪生活的无可奈何的恐惧。这幅油画的主题——农民的贫困和流亡——决不是孤立的和偶然的。根据1933年的统计，当年有82％的农户欠债，其中不少农户因为还不起债款而出卖了产业。在贫困和饥饿的威胁下，过去每年都有大批农民流亡到国外去谋生。从1850年起到解放前夕，流落国外的斯洛伐克人将近八十万，也就是说，三百多万斯洛伐克人，每四个人中就有一个流浪者。这就是斯洛伐克悲惨的过去。
    贫穷和落后永远消失了
    千百年来落后和贫穷的烙印，解放后短短的十五年里已被洗涤得无影无踪了。在这一场对旧世界的一个角落的猛烈冲击中，无数新兴的工业企业和合作化了的农村起着主要的作用。根据捷克斯洛伐克共和国建设社会主义的宏伟计划，从1949年到1958年，在斯洛伐克一共兴建了二百零二个工厂、十五个水力和火力发电站，此外还扩建和改建了一百四十个工厂。这批工厂出现后的第一个结果，就是使就业人口大大增加。
    今天，人们再也用不着勒紧饥饿的肚皮到处去寻找面包了。相反的，流亡在国外的亲人陆续回到家乡，西部地区的捷克兄弟也成批的迁来参加建设工程。从1948年到1956年底，斯洛伐克的劳动力增加了三十七万人，相当于总人口的十分之一还多。增加十分之一，的确不是一个很大的数字。可是，历来计算劳动力的表册上从来是划着负号的斯洛伐克地区，这样的一个巨大的转变不能不说是一个惊人的成就。在这十分之一里，包含着多少辛酸和欢乐啊！
    工业和农业合作化的飞速发展，保证了人民物质和文化生活水平的空前提高。斯洛伐克的个人消费水平，从1949年以来，平均提高了90％以上。
    这种情况，在农村特别显著。我们访问了布拉迪斯拉发近郊的一个叫作西利兹的统一农业合作社。这个合作社建立于1952年，可是真正的巩固和发展是从1955年开始的。在最近的五年内，合作社的生产总值增长了将近四倍，每个劳动日的收入增长了一倍还多，而这个合作社的收入，在斯洛伐克还不算最多的。斯洛伐克“真理报”的同志告诉我们，在全斯洛伐克，每年收入达到十万克朗的农家，约占农户总数的10％到12％。在这样的农村里，谁还能说它仍然是落后和贫困的象征呢？大家读过斯洛伐克伟大诗人格维兹多斯拉夫的诗篇：“奥拉瓦，奥拉瓦，你是多么贫穷啊……”，尽管它的全文还不失其诱人的美丽，但是它所描写的贫穷却已经永远消失了。巨大的社会主义建设的浪潮，早已淹没了、埋葬了奥拉瓦人许多世纪的穷困和屈辱。
    亲如手足的友谊
    斯洛伐克人民昂首向前的每一巨步，都凝结着同他们的捷克兄弟以及苏联和其他国家人民的亲如手足的友谊。这种友谊，是斯洛伐克取得民族解放和社会主义建设胜利的源泉，它像火一样不熄地燃烧在后代人们的心里。
    这种友谊，是在反法西斯战争中结成的。瓦格河畔斯特里其诺小丘上的英雄墓就是一个铁证。斯特里其诺小丘在鲁杜比洛克和日尼那城的中途，“漫游”的瓦格河在它脚下缓缓流过。在这山水之间，有一条曲折的公路，曾经是德国占领者的交通孔道。1945年4月25日，一支由斯洛伐克、捷克、俄罗斯和法兰西四个民族的战士组成的游击队，在这条公路上展开过一场伏击战，阻击一群增援布拉格的德军坦克部队，激烈的战斗持续了五天，游击队员们拖住了德军的尾巴，拯救了成百上千的布拉格人免于死亡。
    在这次激战后不到一个月，德国法西斯就从这个最初被占领的和最后仍图负隅顽抗的国家中全线崩溃了。可是，在距离最后胜利如此接近的这场战斗中，六百零八名不同国籍的战友来不及分享胜利的欢乐就献出了自己的生命。斯洛伐克人民在这里砌造了一座很大的公墓，表示对“幸福的创造者”的感谢。是的，在这英雄的行列里，无论是十八岁的斯洛伐克青年特里布那，或是二十二岁的法国姑娘让娜、俄罗斯的莫斯科维奇夫妇；他们都是值得永世尊敬和怀念的人。这不只是他们生的伟大、死的勇敢；更重要的是他们每一个人的名字，都同国际主义的伟大精神紧紧联结在一起。
    这种友谊，在斯洛伐克的农庄和工厂的建设过程中，也放射着灿烂的光辉。我们参观了“斯洛伐克民族起义工厂”，这是一座巨大的炼铝工厂。这个工厂从各方面吸引着人们的注意：企业管理者仔细考察它的新式装备和复杂的炼制过程；铝加工工厂的采购员反复鉴定它的质量很高的各种产品；历史学家研究和记录它怎样迅速地彻底地改变了古老的如雅尔村的穷困的面貌；而风景画家在这里也可以找到他们的题材：群山老林围绕的大片盆地，格朗河从两岸绿树浓荫的覆盖下奔腾而出，铁道和公路像黑色和黄色的两条巨带沿着河岸平行地伸向远方。在这画面的远方的一个山脚下，成片新盖的厂房和排列整齐的烟囱，生气勃勃地冲破了古老沉寂的山谷，这就是那个巨大的工厂。而我们呢，也怀着一个愿望，这就是要赶去倾听关于友谊的赞歌。
    炼铝工厂1951年才开始建设，1953年8月23日就生产了第一批铝锭。这泛着银白色的亮光的每一块铝锭，都凝结着国际主义的友谊。工厂的设计是捷克和斯洛伐克工程师们合作的结晶，他们又充分利用了匈牙利和苏联提供的技术资料。全部设备是捷克的很多机械工厂的产品。为了掌握这些现代化装备，准确地调整生产，曾经得到苏联专家的忘我的帮助。1956年至1957年，这个工厂还曾派出七十个工程师到苏联去留学参观。到目前为止，斯洛伐克的铝矿还不足供应这个工厂的需要，原料从哪儿来呢？匈牙利是唯一的最近的供应者。
    寻求了解和友情
    在斯洛伐克，我们参观了很多新的建筑，但是最新颖、最伟大和最引人注目的，是建筑在人们内心里的热情的寻求相互了解的愿望和那十分珍重友谊的情感。
    我们刚刚走下飞机踏上布拉迪斯拉发的土地，就受到一位身体健壮的斯洛伐克姑娘的迎接。使我们十分惊讶的是，她竟说一口流利的中国话，这个名叫安娜的姑娘，是斯洛伐克大学东方语的研究生。斯洛伐克记者协会请她来陪伴我们，我们很快地就成了亲密的同伴和朋友。
    在欧洲人看来，中国文字是最难学的，但安娜是怎样选择了学习中国语言的呢？她告诉我们，1949年前后（也就是说她刚刚十四岁左右），捷克斯洛伐克报章杂志上介绍中国的情况很多。从东方古老的文化到新中国的巨大变革，从关于龙的神话到中国人民革命的梦幻般的胜利，从中国歌舞团的优美的演出到各种描写中国人民生活的小说，都深深地吸引了这位少女。她渴望更多地了解中国，于是立下了学习中文的志愿。而在学校里，她在执行青年团分配给她的任务——帮助中国留学生学习捷文的过程中，又结交了好几位中国姐妹。她们的交往，进一步帮助她克服了学习中国会话的很多困难。这样，她的愿望就顺利地实现了。
    安娜现在是斯洛伐克唯一懂得中文的人。她说：“我现在的任务是直接用斯洛伐克文把中国的一些书籍翻译出来。”她已经翻译和出版了郁达夫选集；正在同捷克汉学专家克里普索瓦合译鲁迅选集；明年，她计划要出版吴运铎的“把一切献给党”；后年，则准备译完杨沫的“青春之歌”。
    翻译各国的作品，原是增进彼此了解的一个重要途径。而使各国人民直接接触，更有助于增进彼此的了解和建立持久的友谊。斯洛伐克在这方面也作出了有益的贡献。我们访问了高塔特拉山，这是欧洲出名的风景区和高山疗养地。高塔特拉山横跨捷波两国边境，这里，真是国际人士荟萃之处。波兰的、瑞士的、意大利的和法国的旅行者，每年夏季成群地来到这里休假或者疗养。他们在这里培植了友谊，然后把友谊的种籽放在自己的心头上带了回去。
    在高塔特拉的山腰，绿树丛中立着一幢三层的红楼，每一所窗前都有一个三角形的雅致的阳台。这就是有名的“儿童乐园”。我们由于偶然的机会，访问了这个地方。这里，除了捷克斯洛伐克的少年先锋队员，还有美国、荷兰、冰岛、丹麦、匈牙利等好几个国家的儿童作为暑期的客人。不同的孩子，有不同的习惯；但是所有的孩子都喜欢高山和湖水。“儿童乐园”的辅导员们，也正是通过各种运动和文娱活动，使孩子们之间建立了良好的友谊。虽然这只是一幢楼房里的生活，但是它的意义却远远超过了生活本身的范围。我们深信，在各国人民的胜利进军中，这幢房子里的生活，很快就会成为全世界的共同生活。
