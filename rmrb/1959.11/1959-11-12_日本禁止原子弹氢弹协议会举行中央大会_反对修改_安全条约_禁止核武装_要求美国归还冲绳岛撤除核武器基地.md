Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, November 11th: The Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs held a central convention in Tokyo on the evening of the 10th to oppose the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and prohibit nuclear armament. Approximately 1,500 people from all walks of life in Tokyo participated in the convention.

The convention unanimously passed a resolution demanding that the Nobusuke Kishi government declare that Japan would not pursue nuclear armament and abandon the conspiracy to revise the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

The resolution also demanded that the government abandon its plan to nuclear-arm the Japanese "Self-Defense Forces."

The resolution pointed out that the purpose of revising the "Security Treaty" is to pave the way for dispatching Japanese troops abroad and nuclear-arming the Japanese military.

The convention also passed a resolution addressed to U.S. Ambassador to Japan Douglas MacArthur II, demanding that the U.S. government immediately halt the "Nike" missile exercises currently being conducted in Okinawa. The resolution demanded that the United States remove nuclear weapons bases from Okinawa and return Okinawa to Japan.

The convention also passed a resolution expressing opposition to the introduction of missiles and nuclear weapons into Japanese territory. The resolution called on the Japanese government to put forward proposals conducive to achieving comprehensive disarmament.

Ikuo Yasui, director of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, delivered a report at the convention. Yasui said that the council's current task is to mobilize all peace forces to demand an immediate halt to negotiations on revising the "Security Treaty" and to have local assemblies pass resolutions demanding that Japan not pursue nuclear armament. He went on to say that the task can only be completed by absorbing the broad masses of people into the movement and making them aware of the dangers of revising the "Security Treaty."

Yasui said in his report that so far, one hundred prefectural, city, and town assemblies have passed resolutions demanding that Japan not pursue nuclear armament.

Yoshitaro Hirano, representative member of the Japan Peace Committee, pointed out in his speech that those who resist the tide of the times are doomed to fail.

Socialist Party Diet member Setsuo Yokomichi and Japanese Communist Party member Shigeo Kamiyama refuted the report on the revision of the "Security Treaty" made by Foreign Minister Fujiyama yesterday at a Diet session. Yokomichi said that the Socialist Party would soon submit a proposal to the Diet demanding the immediate abandonment of attempts to revise the "Security Treaty." He emphasized that the struggle inside and outside the Diet should be intensified. He also said that the people's struggle outside the Diet should be carried out simultaneously with the struggle within the Diet.

Shigeo Kamiyama pointed out that Fujiyama's report showed that the Nobusuke Kishi government was attempting to forcibly revise the "Security Treaty" at all costs. He called for strengthening the people's struggle. He pointed out that the struggle is at a decisive stage.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, November 11th: People across Japan are holding rallies and demonstrations to oppose the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and the implementation of nuclear armament.

In Hokkaido, marchers started from four locations towards Sapporo at the end of last month. When they arrived in Sapporo on November 7th, seven thousand people held a rally to express their opposition to the revision of the "Security Treaty" and unemployment.

In Oita Prefecture, marchers converged on Oita City from four routes on November 5th, where a mass rally with one thousand participants was held. In Niigata Prefecture, marches began on November 7th.

The marches were hosted by trade unions, local councils against atomic and hydrogen bombs, the Socialist Party, and the Communist Party. Unemployed workers also actively participated in these marches. During the marches, the marchers presented their demands to local governments and assemblies.

The people of Kyoto Prefecture and Ishikawa, Hiroshima, Kochi, and other prefectures are planning to hold similar marches. In Ishikawa Prefecture, the 13th of this month has been designated as the action day against the revision of the "Security Treaty," and fourteen rallies will be held in the prefecture on that day.

Local councils against atomic and hydrogen bombs have begun preparing for prefectural-level conventions against the revision of the "Security Treaty" and the prohibition of nuclear armament. They will also launch petition campaigns to local assemblies.

Councils against atomic and hydrogen bombs in Fukuoka, Hyogo, Tochigi, and Miyazaki prefectures have already held rallies.

The nationwide Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs will conduct a large-scale petition to the Diet in early December. Representatives from various regions will come to Tokyo to participate in this petition.

    大会一致通过决议，要求岸信介政府宣布日本不进行核武装，并且放弃修改日美“安全条约”的阴谋。
    决议还要求政府放弃使日本“自卫队”核武装的计划。
    决议指出，修改“安全条约”的目的在于为把日本军队派往国外和使日本军队核武装开辟道路。
    大会还通过致美国驻日本大使麦克阿瑟第二的决议，要求美国政府立即停止目前正在冲绳进行的“奈克式”导弹演习。决议要求美国撤除冲绳岛的核武器基地，把冲绳岛归还日本。
    大会还通过决议，表示反对把导弹和核武器运入日本领土。决议要求日本政府提出有助于实现全面裁军的建议。
    日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会理事长安井郁在大会上作了报告。安井郁说，协议会当前的任务是动员一切和平力量，要求立即停止关于修改“安全条约”的谈判，并使各地方议会通过决议，要求日本不进行核武装。他接着说，只有吸收广大人民参加运动，让他们知道修改“安全条约”的危险性，任务才能完成。
    安井郁在报告中说，到现在为止，已有一百个县议会、市议会和町议会通过了决议，要求日本不进行核武装。
    日本和平委员会代表委员平野义太郎在讲话中指出，那些抗拒时代潮流的人是注定要失败的。
    社会党议员横路节雄和日本共产党的神山茂夫驳斥了日本外务相藤山昨天在国会会议上所作的关于修改“安全条约”问题的报告。横路节雄说，社会党不久将向国会提出提案，要求立即放弃修改“安全条约”的企图。他强调说，应当加紧国会内外的斗争。他还说，国会外人民的斗争应当同国会内的斗争同时进行。
    神山茂夫指出，藤山的报告表明，岸信介政府企图不惜一切代价强行修改“安全条约”。他号召加强人民的斗争。他指出，斗争正处在决定性的阶段。
