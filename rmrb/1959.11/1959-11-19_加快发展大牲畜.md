    Accelerate the Development of Large Livestock

    The development of animal husbandry is closely related to the national economy, especially to the development of agriculture and the improvement of people's lives.

    Agriculture is the foundation of animal husbandry; without developed agriculture, there can be no developed animal husbandry. However, we cannot ignore the other aspect: without developed animal husbandry, agriculture will also be greatly affected. Livestock manure is food for crops. Animal husbandry is the mother of agriculture, and agriculture is the son of animal husbandry. Conversely, crops are food for livestock, agriculture is the mother of animal husbandry, and animal husbandry is the son of agriculture. Agriculture and animal husbandry have always been interdependent, mutually mother and son. In Xiangyang People's Commune, Tian'e County, Guangxi, there were 2,920 head of draught cattle before communization, an average of two head of draught cattle per household. In the year after communization, due to the great leap forward in agriculture, livestock also developed greatly, with the number of draught cattle increasing to 4,352, an average of three head of draught cattle per household. Due to the great development of livestock, sufficient fertilizer and animal power were provided for agriculture. The planting area of food crops in the commune expanded by 70%, and the application of cattle manure to farmland increased by about one-fold. In addition to other production-increasing measures, the summer grain harvest of this commune increased by 50% compared with the same period last year. The total annual output is estimated to increase by more than 70% compared with last year. Therefore, in order to develop animal husbandry, it is necessary to accelerate the development of agriculture; in order to achieve greater development of agriculture, it is necessary to accelerate the development of animal husbandry.

    Animal husbandry is also closely related to light industry and the production of non-staple foods. The wool textile industry, leather industry, meat and dairy processing industry, and non-staple food production in light industry all require livestock to provide raw materials. In recent years, animal husbandry has provided a large amount of raw materials to light industry. For example, from 1950 to 1958, it provided 370,000 tons of wool and cashmere and 170 million pieces of cattle and sheep hides; in 1958 alone, it provided 46 million commercial pigs and 10 million goats. In order to develop light industry and non-staple food production, it is also necessary to accelerate the development of animal husbandry.

    With the large increase in agricultural and sideline products, and with the great development of small and medium-sized enterprises, various industrial units have been established in the past poor and remote areas of the motherland, and the volume of short-distance transportation has greatly increased. At present, although state-owned transportation and commune transportation professional teams already have 2 million head of livestock, they still cannot meet the needs of short-distance transportation. This also requires accelerating the development of animal husbandry.

    However, some people do not have a sufficient understanding of the importance of vigorously developing animal husbandry. They believe that since the fundamental way out for agriculture lies in the implementation of mechanization, water conservancy, chemicalization, and electrification, there is no need to actively develop large livestock now. Indeed, in order to fundamentally transform agriculture, it is necessary to actively realize the technical transformation of agriculture and achieve agricultural mechanization, water conservancy, chemicalization, and electrification. Only in this way can the development of agriculture adapt to the development needs of industry and other sectors of the national economy. However, the realization of the technical transformation of agriculture must have a relatively long process. During this process, agriculture will gradually move from semi-mechanization to mechanization. In the semi-mechanization period, animal power is one of the main driving forces of agriculture. Therefore, it is still necessary to continue to develop animal husbandry, especially the development of large livestock such as cattle and horses. Moreover, even after agriculture has been armed with powerful modern technology, large livestock is still an indispensable auxiliary power for agriculture. What's more, the development of large livestock is not only to solve the problem of agricultural power, but also to solve the problem of agricultural fertilizer, and to meet the people's needs for meat, milk, and light industrial products made from livestock products. It can be seen that whether before or after the realization of agricultural mechanization, it is necessary to vigorously develop animal husbandry. Vigorously developing animal husbandry at present will not only not be opposed to mechanization, but also promote the accelerated development of agricultural production, accumulate a large amount of funds, and prepare conditions for the realization of the technical transformation of agriculture.

    Is it possible to accelerate the development of animal husbandry? The answer is yes. The further consolidation of the people's communes has created very favorable conditions for the high-speed development of animal husbandry. The facts of the year since communization have fully demonstrated the great superiority of the commune in developing animal husbandry. With the people's commune, it is easy to make an overall plan for the development of animal husbandry; it is easy to carry out scientific management and raise livestock in groups according to species, gender, and age; it is easy to improve the breeding techniques of breeders; it is easy to plan breeding and improve livestock; it is easy to organize the production and processing of livestock products; it is easy to strengthen the prevention and control of livestock diseases; it is easy to cultivate excellent breeding livestock; it is easy to implement mechanization and electrification in feeding management. It is precisely because communization has created so many favorable conditions for the development of animal husbandry that the speed of livestock development in the year after communization has greatly exceeded that of previous years. Some people believe that pastoral areas and semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas can develop large livestock at high speed, but agricultural areas do not have the conditions for high-speed development. It is undeniable that pastoral areas and semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas have relatively fast development speeds due to vast grasslands, a large proportion of female livestock, and light or no labor for livestock. The proportion of female livestock in agricultural areas is relatively small, and there is a certain contradiction between livestock breeding and labor, which does have a certain impact on livestock breeding. However, agricultural areas also have favorable conditions that livestock areas do not have, such as a large amount of crop straw and relatively sufficient concentrate feed, warm climate, and better equipment. Therefore, as long as we break superstitions, exert our energy, strengthen the feeding and management of livestock, gradually increase the proportion of female livestock, use the slack season for breeding and reproduction, and appropriately resolve the contradiction between reproduction and service, the development speed can also be accelerated. Jilin Province is an agricultural area. This province has seen a double leap forward in livestock breeding and improvement this year. By the end of June this year, the province had developed 1.859 million head of large livestock, an increase of 7.6% compared with the great leap forward in 1958. Among the newly born 70,000 foals, 16,000 were improved horses, an increase of 1.3 times compared with 1958. While livestock has greatly developed, the basic construction of animal husbandry has also greatly developed. The province has established 2,400 various livestock and poultry farms, 2,400 artificial insemination stations, and 508 animal husbandry and veterinary stations; it has also trained 8,200 commune artificial insemination workers and 1,700 livestock epidemic prevention workers, greatly strengthening breeding, reproduction, and epidemic prevention work. Some people also believe that mountainous areas can accelerate the development of large livestock, but plain areas cannot. This view is also incorrect. In fact, not only mountainous areas can accelerate development, but plain areas can also accelerate development. For example, Yancheng County in Henan is a plain area, and the growth of large livestock in 1958 and 1959 was more than 9%. Ge Tang Brigade of Fangli Commune in Changyuan County in this province is not only a plain area, but also an old disaster area. However, because it has drive and determination, large livestock has also grown very quickly, from 160 head in 1954 to 451 head this year, an increase of 1.8 times in six years.

    Although only a minority of people hold the above-mentioned ideas, the great development of livestock will be affected if these right-leaning conservative ideas are not eliminated. Therefore, all localities should thoroughly criticize various right-leaning conservative ideas in accordance with the spirit of opposing right-leaning, exerting energy, and carrying out the increase production and practice economy movement, so as to clear ideological obstacles for the high-speed development of large livestock next year.

    While solving ideological problems, it is also necessary to pay attention to doing a series of organizational work and specific preparations.

    The gestation period of large livestock is generally about ten months. The more that are bred this year, the more that will be born next year, laying a good foundation for the following year. This year, all localities have launched a large-scale breeding campaign in accordance with the notice of the Party Central Committee and the State Council on seizing the spring to carry out the breeding movement of large livestock, and have achieved remarkable results. According to statistics from 18 provinces including Hebei, Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu at the end of September, 9.32 million head of female livestock have been bred and are pregnant, accounting for 58.7% of the eligible female livestock in these 18 provinces. In some provinces, the proportion of pregnant livestock has reached more than 70%, which is very beneficial to increasing livestock next year. However, on the whole, the development of the breeding movement is still uneven, and the proportion of pregnant livestock is not very high. In order to strive for a great leap forward in animal husbandry next year, it is necessary to seize the four months of November and December this year and January and February next year, and vigorously carry out winter and spring breeding, and strive to make every female livestock pregnant.

    Miscarriage of pregnant livestock in winter and spring is a serious problem that hinders the increase in the development speed of large livestock. Some places have already begun to miscarry pregnant livestock this year. The Heilongjiang Provincial Department of Agriculture investigated 4,273 pregnant livestock in eight communes and found that 519 of them had miscarried, with a miscarriage rate of 12.1%. This serious situation must be completely changed. The current is a tense season for winter plowing and large-scale short-distance transportation, and a large number of pregnant livestock are participating in labor. All localities must pay attention to doing a good job in protecting pregnant livestock. While protecting pregnant livestock, it is also necessary to strengthen the protection of general livestock. All localities should conduct a major inspection of the work of protecting livestock over the winter recently, repair livestock pens, increase cold-proof and insulation equipment, and check the storage of feed, so that livestock has sufficient feed. Concentrate feed for livestock should be withheld in sufficient quantities during the autumn harvest distribution in accordance with the principle of "fixed quantity per head, allocated to the field, livestock grain for livestock consumption, and no misappropriation." It is necessary to improve the livestock feeding management system, implement special person feeding of pregnant and old and weak livestock, and implement "partial feed, partial grass, and partial management" to ensure that all livestock is not thin, not sick, and pregnant livestock does not miscarry, and completely change the phenomenon of livestock thinning, death, and miscarriage that occurred every winter and spring in the past.

    Finally, it is necessary to effectively grasp the specific leadership for the development of large livestock. At present, it is necessary to grasp three major tasks: One is to carry out propaganda and education on the development of large livestock from top to bottom, mobilize the masses to speak freely and debate, criticize various right-leaning conservative ideas, and on this basis, formulate a leap forward plan for the development of large livestock next year, implement the plan level by level to the contract production units, and have specific measures to ensure the realization of the plan. One is to strengthen the leadership of livestock development in general areas, and at the same time, establish large livestock breeding bases in areas with water and grass, hilly areas, lakeside areas, coastal areas, and all other areas with conditions. In addition to self-sufficient production, the main purpose is to carry out commercial production, breed a large number of commercial livestock and meat livestock to supply the needs of the state and other places. Provinces, special districts, counties, and communes can establish such bases. This is an important measure to accelerate the development speed of large livestock. One is to promote advanced experience. In various regions, whether pastoral areas, agricultural areas, mountainous areas, plain areas, or cash crop areas, a number of models with rapid development of large livestock have emerged, and they have created and accumulated rich experience. In order to promote the high-speed development of large livestock across the country, we should promote these experiences in a timely manner through on-site visits, evaluations, and inspections, just like promoting the high-yield experience of wheat, rice, pig raising, and chicken raising, so as to promote the development of the livestock breeding movement and ensure the great development of livestock next year.

    加快发展大牲畜
    畜牧业的发展对于国民经济、特别是对农业的发展与人民生活的改善，有着十分密切的关系。
    农业是畜牧业的基础，没有发达的农业，就不会有发达的畜牧业；但是也不能忽视另一方面，这就是没有发达的畜牧业，农业也会受到很大的影响。牲畜的粪便是农作物的食料，畜牧业是农业的母亲，农业是畜牧业的儿子；反过来，农作物又是牲畜的食料，农业又是畜牧业的母亲，畜牧业又是农业的儿子。农业和畜牧业从来就是彼此依存、互为母子的。广西天峨县向阳人民公社，公社化前有耕牛二千九百二十头，平均每户有耕牛两头。公社化后的一年，由于农业大跃进，牲畜也大发展，耕牛增至四千三百五十二头，平均每户有耕牛三头。由于牲畜的大发展，为农业提供了充足的肥料、畜力，公社粮食作物种植面积扩大了70％；农田施用的牛粪增加一倍左右。再加上其他增产措施，这个公社的夏收粮食比去年同期增长了50％。全年总产量估计可比去年增长70％以上。所以，为了畜牧业的发展，必须加快农业的发展；为了农业更大的发展，又必须加快畜牧业的发展。
    畜牧业和轻工业、副食品生产也有着非常密切的关系，轻工业中的毛纺工业、制革工业、肉类奶类加工工业和副食品生产都需要牲畜提供原料。几年来，畜牧业向轻工业提供了大量原料，如1950年到1958年，就提供了羊毛、羊绒三十七万吨，牛皮、羊皮一亿七千万张；仅仅1958年一年就提供了商品猪四千六百万头，菜羊一千万只。为了发展轻工业和副食品生产，也必须加快发展畜牧业。
    随着农副产品的大量增加，随着中小型企业的大发展，在祖国过去的穷乡僻壤已经星罗棋布地建立起各种各样的工业单位，短途运输量就大大增加。目前国营运输业和公社运输专业队虽然已有牲畜二百万头，但是仍然不能满足短途运输的需要。这也要求加快畜牧业的发展。
    但是，有些人对于大力发展畜牧业的重要性认识不足。他们认为：既然农业的根本出路在于实行机械化、水利化、化学化和电气化，现在就不必积极发展大牲畜。诚然，为了从根本上改造农业，必须积极地实现农业的技术改造，实现农业机械化、水利化、化学化、电气化。也只有这样，农业的发展才能够适应工业和国民经济其他部门的发展需要。但是，实现农业的技术改造，必须有一个较长的过程，在这个过程中，农业将逐步由半机械化到机械化。在半机械化时期，畜力则是农业的主要动力之一。因此，目前还必须继续发展畜牧业，特别是发展牛、马等大牲畜。而且，就是农业已经用强大的现代化技术武装起来以后，大牲畜仍然是农业不可缺少的辅助动力。何况发展大牲畜还不仅仅是为了解决农业动力问题，同时是为了解决农业的肥料，为了满足人民对肉类、奶类和以畜产品为原料的轻工业产品的需要。可见，不论是实现农业机械化以前还是以后，都需要大力发展畜牧业。在目前大力发展畜牧业，不但不会和机械化相对立，而且可以促进农业生产的加速发展，积累大量资金，为实现农业的技术改造准备条件。
    能不能加快畜牧业的发展呢？答复是肯定的。人民公社的更加巩固，为畜牧业的高速度发展创造了十分有利的条件。公社化后一年来的事实，已充分显示了公社在发展畜牧业这一方面的巨大优越性。有了人民公社，便于作出发展畜牧业的全面规划；便于进行科学管理，对牲畜按照畜别、性别、年龄等分群饲养；便于提高饲养员的饲养技术；便于有计划地繁殖和改良牲畜；便于组织畜产品的生产和加工；便于加强牲畜疫病的防治；便于培育优良种畜；便于在饲养管理方面实行机械化、电气化。正是由于公社化给畜牧业的发展创造了这样多的有利条件，所以公社化后一年来牲畜发展的速度大大超过往年。有人认为：牧区和半农半牧区可以高速度发展大牲畜，农业地区就没有高速度发展的条件。不可否认，牧区和半农半牧区，由于草原广阔，母畜比例大，牲畜劳役轻或不负担劳役，发展速度是比较快的。农业区母畜比例比较小，牲畜的繁殖和劳役存在一定的矛盾，对牲畜的繁殖确实有一定的影响。但是，农业区也具备了畜牧区所没有的有利条件，比如农业区有大量的农作物秸秆和比较充足的精饲料，气候温暖，设备较好，等等。因此，只要破除迷信，鼓足干劲，加强牲畜的饲养管理，逐步提高母畜比例，利用农闲配种繁殖，适当解决繁殖和使役的矛盾，发展速度也是可以加快的。吉林省就是一个农业区，这个省今年就出现了牲畜繁殖和改良双跃进的局面，到今年6月末全省大家畜已发展到一百八十五万九千头，比大跃进的1958年增加了7.6％；在新生的七万匹马驹中有一万六千匹是改良马，比1958年增加了一点三倍。在牲畜大发展的同时，畜牧业的基本建设也有了很大发展，全省共建立了各种畜禽场二千四百处，人工授精站二千四百处，畜牧兽医站五百零八个；还培养了八千二百名公社的人工授精员和一千七百名畜牧防疫员，大大地加强了配种、繁殖和防疫工作。又有人认为：山区可以加快发展大牲畜，平原区不行。这种看法也是不对的。事实上不但山区可以加速发展，平原区也同样可以加速发展。如河南郾城县是个平原区，1958年和1959年大牲畜的增长都在9％以上；这个省的长垣县方里公社葛堂大队，不但是个平原区，而且是个老灾区，可是因为有了干劲，有了决心，大牲畜也增长得非常快，从1954年的一百六十头到今年已增至四百五十一头，六年内增加了一点八倍。
    有以上这些思想的人虽然是少数，但是，不消除这些右倾保守思想，牲畜的大发展就会受到影响。因此，各地应当根据反右倾、鼓干劲、开展增产节约运动的精神，对各种右倾保守思想，进行彻底的批判，为明年大牲畜的高速度发展扫清思想障碍。
    在解决思想问题的同时，也必须注意做好一系列的组织工作和具体准备工作。
    大牲畜的怀孕期一般在十个月左右，今年配的多，明年才能生的多，前一年为后一年打好基础。今年各地已经根据党中央和国务院关于抓紧春季开展大牲畜配种运动的通知，开展了大规模的配种运动，取得了显著成绩。据河北、河南、安徽、江苏等十八个省9月末的统计，已配种怀孕的母畜有九百三十二万头，占这十八个省适龄母畜的58.7％，有的省份孕畜比例已达到70％以上，这对明年增加牲畜，十分有利。但是，总的来看，配种运动发展得还不平衡，孕畜的比例还不很高。为了争取明年畜牧业大跃进，必须抓紧今年11、12月和明年的1、2月这四个月时间，大搞冬、春配种，力争头头母畜满怀。
    冬春孕畜流产是阻碍提高大牲畜发展速度的一个严重问题。今年有些地方的孕畜已开始流产，黑龙江省农业厅在八个公社调查了四千二百七十三头孕畜，发现其中已有五百一十九头流产，流产率达到12.1％。这种严重的情况，必须彻底改变。当前正是冬耕和大搞短途运输的紧张季节，有大批孕畜参加劳役，各地必须注意做好孕畜保护工作。在保护孕畜的同时，也要加强对一般牲畜的保护工作，各地要在最近进行一次保护牲畜过冬工作的大检查，修补畜栏，增加防寒保温设备，检查饲草贮备情况，作到牲畜有充足的饲草；对牲畜的精饲料，要根据“按头定量，分配到场，畜粮畜吃，不得挪用”的原则，在秋收分配中就扣留充足。要健全牲畜饲养管理制度，实行孕畜和老弱牲畜的专人分槽喂养，并实行“偏料、偏草、偏管理”，作到所有牲畜不瘦、不病，孕畜不流产，彻底改变过去每到冬春就发生牲畜瘦弱、死亡、流产的现象。
    最后，要切实抓紧发展大牲畜的具体领导，当前要抓紧三件大事：一件是由上而下的开展发展大牲畜的宣传教育，发动群众鸣放、辩论，批判各种右倾保守思想，在此基础上制定明年发展大牲畜的跃进计划，把计划逐级落实到包产单位，并且要有保证计划实现的具体措施。一件是在加强对一般地区发展牲畜工作领导的同时，在有水有草的地区、丘陵区、滨湖、滨海地区和其他一切有条件的地区，建立大牲畜的繁殖基地，除自给性生产外，主要是进行商品性生产，繁殖大量商品牲畜和肉畜供应国家和外地需要。省、专、县、社四级都可以建立这种基地，这是对于加快大牲畜发展速度有重要意义的措施。一件是推广先进经验。在各个地区，不论是牧区、农区、山区、平原区、经济作物区，都已经出现了一批大牲畜发展快的榜样，他们创造和积累了丰富的经验。为了促进全国大牲畜的高速度发展，我们应当像推广小麦、水稻、养猪、养鸡的丰产经验一样，通过现场参观、评比检查，及时地交流推广这些经验，以推动牲畜繁殖运动的开展，保证明年牲畜大发展。
