Xinhua News Agency, Kunming Electric Dispatch: Kunming Machine Tool Plant workers fully tapped the potential of materials. Since the third quarter, they have increased hundreds of tons of pig iron, steel, and non-ferrous metal materials by adopting methods such as controlling machining allowances and recycling waste materials.

During the production increase and economy campaign, the plant's workers recovered and sorted discarded pig iron, steel, and other materials. In the third quarter alone, they recovered more than 116 tons of waste pig iron, more than 28 tons of waste steel, more than 70 tons of steel scraps, and a batch of waste copper. The forging workshop regards waste material recovery as a regular task. The workshop party branch regularly educates workers on saving steel and cherishing state property, requiring party members to take the lead in recovering material heads, coke, etc., and has established material head collection boxes and savings registration books, recording the achievements of each worker in saving materials, and conducting regular evaluations and commendations.

Now, these recovered waste iron and steel, steel scraps, and iron scraps have been fully utilized. The foundry workshop uses waste sandboxes, waste castings, and iron scraps as castings. The forging workshop forges some waste material heads into small steel materials with a diameter of 8 to 12 mm for the general workshop to use as standard parts. Small material heads are used for small screws, washers, knife handles, and tools, fixtures, and molds.

The workers deeply realized the importance of ensuring quality for saving materials, so they tried every means to reduce and eliminate defective products. The foundry workshop originally had dozens of tons of unusable castings every month. After the factory carried out education on increasing production and practicing economy, the scrap rate has now decreased significantly.

    昆明机床厂控制加工余量节约金属材料
    新华社昆明电　昆明机床厂职工充分发掘材料潜力，第三季度以来，采用控制加工余量、回收废料等办法，增加了几百吨生铁、钢和有色金属材料。
    在增产节约运动中，这个厂的职工将废弃的生铁、钢材等材料收回整理，仅第三季度就回收了废生铁一百一十六吨多，废钢二十八吨多，钢屑七十多吨，还有一批废杂铜。锻压车间把回收废料当作一项经常的任务。车间党支部经常对职工进行节约钢材、爱惜国家财产的教育，要求党员带头回收料头、焦炭等，并且设立了料头收集箱和节约登记簿，登记每个职工在节约材料中做出的成绩，定期评比表扬。
    现在，这些回收起来的废钢铁和钢屑、铁屑，已被充分利用。铸造车间用废沙箱、废铸件、铁屑作铸件。锻工车间把一些废料头锻成八至十二毫米直径的小钢材，给通用车间做标准件用。小料头用来作小螺钉、垫圈、刀柄和工具、夹具、模具等。
    职工们深切地认识到保证质量对节约材料的重要意义，因此千方百计减少和消灭废品。铸造车间原来每月有几十吨不能用的铸件。经过工厂开展增产节约的教育后，现在废品率已显著下降。
