Xinhua News Agency, Luoyang, November 1st: The First Tractor Factory has received enthusiastic support from factories and the masses across the country during its construction. More than 130 factories across the country have provided it with equipment, nearly 600 factories have produced various auxiliary materials for it, and more than 140 factories have trained cadres and technicians for it. Especially under the encouragement of the spirit of the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and the slogan of "achieving agricultural mechanization as soon as possible," the enthusiasm of various places to support the tractor factory has become even higher. Steel plants in Chongqing, Anshan, and Daye, Hubei, recently delivered steel to Luoyang two months ahead of schedule.

In order to make the soon-to-be-produced tractors more beautiful, many paint factories across the country designed colors for it, and dozens of color samples were sent to the tractor factory. The Xi'an Paint Factory sent people to Luoyang three times to solicit opinions; finally, they adopted the "Rose Red" they designed. The workers of Luoyang Rubber Factory actively improved their work efficiency in order to supply the parts used in the tractor chassis in a timely manner, with each person averaging 20 hours of work per day. Recently, due to problems with the coking machine, seven workers carried hundreds of kilograms of rubber overnight to Zhengzhou for processing.

Party committees at all levels and the broad masses of the people in Henan Province have been providing bricks for bricks, tiles for tiles, and giving priority to the supply of grain, grass, vegetables, and meat since the first tractor factory began preparations for construction. When the factory urgently needed charcoal, the broad masses of the people in Nanyang Prefecture went up the mountains to cut trees and burn charcoal. They carried the 28 tons of charcoal they had burned down the mountain bundle by bundle and then sent it to the factory. They said, "If the factory starts production earlier, we will have tractors here sooner."

In the process of construction and production, the tractor factory produced hundreds of tractors and distributed them to rural areas across the country. The farmers there, in turn, transported the products produced by their factories to the tractor factory. The Dazhong People's Commune in Xuzhou, Jiangsu, sent more than 10,000 tons of refractory clay and a large number of square bricks and stones.

Thousands of "Young Pioneers" across the country also sent the money they earned from picking up waste and gleaning wheat to the tractor factory, asking to contribute a brick, a tile, or a piece of iron to the first tractor factory in New China.

    通力合作加快农业技术改造
    全国八百多个工厂热情支援第一拖拉机厂
    据新华社洛阳1日电　第一拖拉机制造厂在建厂过程中，得到全国各地工厂和广大群众的热情支援。全国有一百三十多个工厂为它提供了设备，有近六百个工厂为它生产了各种辅助材料，有一百四十多个工厂为它培养和训练了干部和技术工人，特别是在党的八届八中全会决议精神鼓舞下，和“提早实现农业机械化”的口号下，各地支援拖拉机厂的情绪更加高昂。重庆、鞍山和湖北大冶等钢铁厂，最近都提早两个月把钢材运来洛阳。
    为了使即将出厂的拖拉机打扮得更漂亮，全国许多油漆工厂为它设计色彩，几十种彩色样本送到了拖拉机厂。西安油漆工厂曾经三次派人来洛阳征求意见；最后，采用了他们设计的“玫瑰红”。洛阳橡胶厂的职工们为了及时供应拖拉机底盘使用的零件，积极提高工作效率，每人每天平均达到二十小时的工作量；最近因为炼焦机有毛病，七名职工背了几百公斤橡胶连夜赶到郑州加工。
    河南省的各级党委和广大群众，从第一拖拉机厂开始筹建起，一直做到了要砖给砖、要瓦给瓦，粮、草、蔬菜和肉类优先供给。正当工厂急需用木炭的时候，南阳专区的广大群众上山伐树烧炭，他们把烧好的二十八吨炭一捆一捆地从山上背下来，然后再送到工厂。他们说：“工厂早点开工，咱这里就早日有拖拉机。”
    拖拉机厂在边建设边生产的过程中，生产了几百台拖拉机分送到各地农村，那里的农民又把自己工厂生产的产品运到拖拉机厂。江苏徐州大众人民公社送来了一万多吨耐火土和大量的方块砖石。
    全国还有成千上万个“红领巾”，把拾废物和拾麦穗换来的钱寄到拖拉机厂，要求为新中国的第一座拖拉机厂贡献一块砖、一块瓦、一块铁。
