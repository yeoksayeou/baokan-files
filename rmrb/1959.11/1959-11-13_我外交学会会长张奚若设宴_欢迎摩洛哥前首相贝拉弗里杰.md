Xinhua News Agency, November 12th. Zhang Xiruo, President of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, held a banquet tonight to warmly welcome former Moroccan Prime Minister Ahmed Belafrej and Ahmed Ralahki, former Director of the Prime Minister's Office, on their visit to China.

　　Zhang Xiruo delivered a speech at the banquet. He said that the relationship between China and Morocco and between the two peoples has recently seen new developments. Not long ago, the two countries established diplomatic relations and signed a trade agreement. More and more people from both countries are visiting each other, enhancing the understanding between the two peoples. Mr. Belafrej and Mr. Ralahki's visit to China will surely make new contributions to further developing the relations between the two countries and enhancing the understanding between the two peoples. Zhang Xiruo wished the former Prime Minister a pleasant and successful visit to China.

　　Mr. Belafrej said in his speech that China had suffered devastation and oppression from foreign imperialism for a very long time. The recent revolution not only liberated China politically but also socially. As a foreigner, he has always admired the great achievements made by the new China in a very short period of time with envious feelings. In the near future, the Chinese people will surely enjoy new and great progress in the process of industrialization, and at the same time, will also achieve greater achievements in culture and social civilization. Belafrej said that after returning home, he would convey the achievements of the Chinese people he saw to the Moroccan people, and wished the relations between Morocco and China long-term consolidation and development.

    我外交学会会长张奚若设宴
    欢迎摩洛哥前首相贝拉弗里杰
    新华社12日讯　中国人民外交学会会长张奚若今晚举行宴会，热烈欢迎摩洛哥前首相艾哈迈德·贝拉弗里杰和前首相办公室主任艾哈迈德·拉哈基访问中国。
    张奚若首先在宴会上致词。他说，中摩两国和两国人民之间的关系最近有了新的发展，不久前两国建立了邦交，签订了贸易协定，越来越多的两国人士相互访问，增进了两国人民的了解。贝拉弗里杰先生和拉哈基先生这次访问中国，必将对进一步发展两国关系和增进两国人民的了解，作出新的贡献。张奚若预祝前首相这次在中国的访问愉快、成功。
    贝拉弗里杰先生致词说，中国在过去的很长时间中曾经遭受外国帝国主义的摧残和压迫，不久前的革命不仅在政治方面而且在社会方面解放了中国。对于一个外国人来说，他一直以羡慕的心情赞赏着新中国在很短的时间内取得的巨大成就。不久的将来，中国人民必将在工业化过程中享受新的巨大进展，同时在文化和社会文明方面也获得更大的成就。贝拉弗里杰表示回去以后要把他看到的中国人民的成就转告摩洛哥人民，并且预祝摩中两国关系长久地巩固和发展下去。
