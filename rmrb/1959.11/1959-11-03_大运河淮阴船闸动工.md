Construction of the Huaiyin ship lock on the Grand Canal of Beijing-Hangzhou recently commenced. The lock chamber has a net width of 20 meters at the bottom and is 230 meters long. Upon completion, it will be able to accommodate 3,000-ton vessels, increasing the navigation capacity by about five times. It will also increase the flood discharge capacity of the central section of the Grand Canal, diverting 800 cubic meters per second into the Yangtze River, and regulate the water volume of the Huai and Yi Rivers.
