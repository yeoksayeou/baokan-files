    Taoyuan Fort: A Model for Poor Teams Catching Up with Rich Teams
    Agricultural income doubles that of last year, with an average income of 120 yuan per commune member
    The main experiences are: grasping both agriculture and diversified operations; grasping both collective production and household sideline occupations; grasping both diligence and thrift.
    (This report) Our newspaper reports that the Taoyuan Fort Management Area of the Shahe People's Commune in Taigu County, Shanxi Province, which used to be relatively backward in production and poor in living standards, has transformed from poverty to wealth after a short year of hard work.
    This year, the total collective production income of the Taoyuan Fort Management Area reached 400,500 yuan, an increase of 1.1 times compared to last year. The total amount distributed to commune members was 200,700 yuan, accounting for 51% of the total income, with an average income of 120 yuan per person. Including the income from commune members' household sideline occupations, it reached 142.7 yuan, an increase of nearly two times compared to last year, only 6.5 yuan less than the local wealthy management area of Yangjiazhuang.
    In just one year, the Taoyuan Fort Management Area was able to transform from poverty to wealth and catch up with the Yangjiazhuang Management Area. The main experience is adhering to the policy of "walking on two legs." The so-called "walking on two legs" is mainly manifested in the following aspects:
    Grasping both agricultural production and diversified operations. This year, their agricultural income was 360,400 yuan, exceeding last year by 104%; forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline income reached more than 45,000 yuan, accounting for 12.5% of agricultural income, exceeding last year by 142%.
    Grasping both food crops and cash crops. In the past, one of the reasons for poverty and backwardness here was the small amount and low yield of cash crops such as cotton and vegetables. This year, they fiercely grasped this weak link. The income from cash crops alone exceeded the total income of the entire year last year. At the same time, the average yield per mu of the 3,700 mu of food crops in the entire management area reached 365 jin, an increase of 38% compared to last year.
    Grasping both collective production and commune members' household sideline production. The Taoyuan Fort Management Area stipulates this year that under the premise of not affecting collective production, each commune member has two to four days of flexible time per month to engage in sideline production. Therefore, this year, the income from commune members' household sideline production reached more than 39,000 yuan, accounting for 9.7% of the collective income, with an average of 22.7 yuan per person.
    Grasping both diligence and thrift. There were two reasons why Taoyuan Fort was poor and backward in the past: they were satisfied with having a good foundation but were lazy in processing and applying fertilizer; they didn't have much wealth but lived like they were rich, with poor days being treated like rich days. This spring, they put forward the ambitious slogan of "Learn from Yangjiazhuang, Catch up with Yangjiazhuang, Surpass Yangjiazhuang," and the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses was mobilized. When fertilizer was insufficient, they organized seven shock campaigns to accumulate fertilizer, so that the average amount of base fertilizer applied per mu of all crops exceeded twice that of last year; the attendance rate of commune members increased from 75% to more than 97%. Up to now, the entire management area has completed 141,000 workdays, and the average number of workdays completed per person has exceeded the average number of workdays completed per person for the entire year last year by 10.6%. In terms of thrift: last year, production investment and administrative expenses accounted for 52.6% of the total income, while this year they only accounted for 32% of the total income.
    The transformation of Taoyuan Fort Management Area from poverty to wealth fully demonstrates the superiority of the people's commune. The people's commune has strong human and material resources, and vigorously carries out basic construction. In one year, the poor Taoyuan Fort has been able to use electricity to draw water and grind flour. These two items alone can save 48,000 labor days and 10,000 animal power days throughout the year. At the beginning of spring, the commune party committee transferred 20,000 jin of grain and 7,000 jin of straw from six management areas including Hui'an to Taoyuan Fort, which lacked grass for livestock and grain for people, ensuring the smooth progress of spring plowing production. Therefore, the commune members said: This year's bumper harvest was brought about by the people's commune. In order to help the Taoyuan Fort Management Area change its appearance, at the beginning of spring, the commune party committee sent party committee member Gao Honglin to stay here to help with the work.
    External assistance is also an important reason for the transformation of Taoyuan Fort from poverty to wealth. This year, the state provided a production investment loan of 10,700 yuan, helping to purchase 30,000 jin of chemical fertilizer, large truck tires, etc., which solved the difficulties in expanding reproduction. In addition, the county party committee also helped them find many sideline production avenues. The commune members of Taoyuan Fort deeply realize the consistency of the interests of small collectives and national interests. Therefore, after the autumn grain purchase work began, they completed the task of purchasing more than 230,000 jin of grain in one night on October 10, not only more than a month earlier than in previous years, but also with better grain quality.

    桃园堡——穷队赶富队的标兵
    农业收入比去年增加一倍，社员平均收入一百二十元
    主要经验是：既抓农业，又抓多种经营；既抓集体生产，又抓家庭副业；既抓勤，又抓俭
    本报讯　生产原来比较落后、生活比较穷困的山西太谷县沙河人民公社桃园堡管理区，经过短短一年的奋战，已经由穷变富。
    今年，桃园堡管理区的集体生产总收入达四十万零五千多元，比去年增加了一点一倍。社员分配部分总额为二十万零七千多元，占总收入51％，平均每人收入一百二十元，连同社员家庭副业收入达到一百四十二元七角，比去年增加了将近两倍，和当地富裕管理区杨家庄相比，仅差六元五角。
    在短短的一年间，桃园堡管理区能够由穷变富，赶上杨家庄管理区，主要的经验是坚持贯彻了“两条腿走路”的方针。所谓“两条腿走路”，主要表现在以下几方面：
    既抓农业生产，又抓多种经营。今年他们的农业收入为三十六万零四百元，超过去年104％；林、牧、副业收入达四万五千多元，占农业收入的12.5％，超过去年142％。
    既抓粮食作物，又抓经济作物。过去，这里穷困落后的原因之一，就是棉花、蔬菜等经济作物种得少，产量低。今年他们狠狠地抓住了这一薄弱环节，光经济作物一项，就比去年全年总收入还多。与此同时，全管理区的三千七百多亩粮食作物，平均亩产达三百六十五斤，比去年提高38％。
    既抓集体生产，又抓社员家庭副业生产。桃园堡管理区今年规定：在不影响集体生产的前提下，每个社员每月有二至四天的机动时间，由社员自己搞副业生产。因此，今年社员家庭副业生产收入达到三万九千多元，占集体收入的9.7％，每人平均二十二元七角。
    既抓勤，又抓俭。桃园堡过去所以穷困落后，原因有两条：满足于地板好，懒于加工施肥；财不粗，气不壮，穷日子要当富日子过。今年春天他们提出“学杨家庄，赶杨家庄，超杨家庄”的豪迈口号，群众的革命干劲被发动起来了。肥料不够，他们组织了七次突击积肥运动，使所有农作物平均亩施底肥量超过去年一倍；社员出勤率由75％增加到97％以上。到目前为止，全管理区实做劳动日十四万一千个，每人平均实做劳动日比去年全年每人平均实做劳动日还超过10.6％。在俭省方面：去年生产投资和行政费用占总收入的52.6％，今年只占总收入的32％。
    桃园堡管理区由穷变富，充分显示了人民公社的优越性。人民公社人力物力雄厚，大搞基本建设，一年间，贫困的桃园堡已能用电力车水、磨面，仅这两项，全年就可节省劳力四万八千个，畜力一万个。开春，桃园堡牲口没草、人缺粮，公社党委便从惠安等六个管理区调剂来粮食二万斤、谷草七千斤，保证了春耕生产的顺利进行。因此社员们说：今年大丰收是人民公社带来的。为了帮助桃园堡管理区改变面貌，开春，公社党委就派党委委员高鸿林常驻这里帮助工作。
    桃园堡由穷变富，外力的援助也是一个重要原因。今年，国家贷给生产投资款一万零七百元，帮助购买了化肥三万斤、大车胶轮带等，解决了扩大再生产的困难。此外，县委还帮助他们找到了很多副业生产门路。桃园堡的社员深深体会到小集体利益和国家利益的一致性。因此，在秋粮征购工作开始后，他们在10月10日的一个晚上，就完成了二十三万多斤粮食征购任务，不仅比往年提前了一个多月，而且粮食的质量也好。
