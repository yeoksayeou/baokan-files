Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 29th - According to "Lao Patriotic News" reports: The American-Sananikone clique's plot to "interrogate" Prince Souphanouvong and other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front has aroused great anger among the Lao people. Lao Patriotic Front organizations in various regions and people in various places have gathered, sent telegrams, or issued protests, strongly opposing the illegal actions of the American-Sananikone clique.

The Vientiane Provincial Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front said in a telegram to the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front, "The people of Vientiane Province severely condemn the fascist actions of the Sananikone government and demand that the Sananikone government immediately restore the freedom of Prince Souphanouvong and other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front."

The Xieng Khouang Provincial Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front unanimously passed a motion at a special meeting held on October 23, firmly demanding that the Sananikone government immediately revoke its decision to "interrogate" Prince Souphanouvong and other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front and restore their freedom.

On October 23, the Luang Prabang Provincial Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front sent a telegram to the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front, expressing its determination to stand with the people of the province to resolutely fight for the restoration of freedom for Prince Souphanouvong and the other seven leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front, and to oppose the illegal "interrogation" of the Lao people's true leaders. The telegram stated that the people of Luang Prabang Province are determined to unite closely around the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front, resolutely promote the national salvation movement against American interventionists and their running dogs, and lead Laos onto the path of peace, neutrality, independence, democracy, unity, and prosperity.

More than two hundred people and guerrillas from the Than Khao and Huai Run areas of Xieng Khouang Province recently held a rally to protest the Sananikone government's crimes in preparing to "interrogate" the leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 30th - The Korean "Rodong Sinmun" published a commentary today condemning the Sananikone clique's illegal plot to try Prince Souphanouvong and other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front. The commentary pointed out that this illegal trial would be a gross violation of the 1954 Geneva Accords on Laos and the 1957 Vientiane Agreements. These two agreements recognized the merits of the former Lao combat forces in their struggle for national independence. The Sananikone clique's accusation of "national traitor" against Souphanouvong and seven other leaders of the Patriotic Front is fabricated.

The commentary said that the Korean people sympathize with the Lao Patriotic Front Central Committee's recent appeal to peace-loving people around the world, strongly condemn the Sananikone clique's criminal conspiracy, and firmly demand the immediate and unconditional release of Prince Souphanouvong and other Lao patriots.

Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 30th - French Communist Party Central Committee Secretary Léo Figuères published an article in "L'Humanité" today protesting the Lao government's illegal trial of Lao Patriotic Front leader Prince Souphanouvong and others. He called on the French people to firmly demand respect for the Geneva Accords, withdraw the charges against Souphanouvong and his colleagues, and immediately release them.

He asked the French people to protest to the Lao government and the Lao Embassy in Paris in their individual or collective capacity.

Figuères condemned the Lao authorities' attempt to have a special court impose heavy sentences on those in Laos who advocate democracy, while suppressing the activities of democratic elements. He revealed that the United States is using the situation in Laos to intensify its control.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 30th - The Czechoslovak Journalists Association sent a telegram to Lao Prime Minister Sananikone on the 30th, protesting the persecution of Lao patriotic democratic journalists Khamphan Panya and Sisana Sisane.

The telegram stated that their arrest and the entire trial arranged for Prince Souphanouvong and other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front are unprincipled attacks on freedom, democracy, and peace.

    老挝人民不许迫害苏发努冯
    老挝爱国战线党各地组织抗议美萨集团的罪行
    各国舆论纷纷要求释放老挝爱国者
    据新华社河内29日电　据“老挝爱国新闻”报道：美国—萨纳尼空集团准备“审讯”苏发努冯亲王和老挝爱国战线党其他领导人的阴谋，引起了老挝人民的极大愤怒。老挝爱国战线党各地组织和各地人民纷纷集会、打电报或通过抗议书，强烈反对美萨集团的非法行为。
    老挝爱国战线党万象省委员会在致老挝爱国战线党中央委员会的电文中说，“万象省人民严厉谴责萨纳尼空政府的法西斯行为，要求萨纳尼空政府立即恢复苏发努冯亲王和老挝爱国战线党其他领导人的自由。”
    老挝爱国战线党川圹省委员会在10月23日举行的特别会议一致通过建议书，坚决要求萨纳尼空政府立即撤销“审讯”苏发努冯亲王和老挝爱国战线党其他领导人的决定，恢复他们的自由。
    老挝爱国战线党琅勃拉邦省委员会10月23日打电报给老挝爱国战线党中央委员会，表示决心同本省人民一起，坚决为争取恢复苏发努冯亲王和老挝爱国战线党其他七位领导人的自由、为反对非法“审讯”老挝人民真正的领导人而斗争。电报说，琅勃拉邦全省人民决心紧密团结在老挝爱国战线党中央委员会的周围，坚决推进反对美国干涉者和它的走狗的救国运动，使老挝走上和平、中立、独立、民主、统一和富强的道路。
    川圹省探考、会润地区的人民和游击队员二百多人最近举行集会，抗议萨纳尼空政府准备“审讯”老挝爱国战线党领导人的罪行。
    据新华社平壤30日电　朝鲜“劳动新闻”今天发表评论，谴责老挝萨纳尼空集团非法审判苏发努冯亲王和老挝爱国战线党其他领导人的罪恶阴谋。评论指出，这种非法审判将粗暴地违反1954年关于老挝的日内瓦协议和1957年的万象协议。这两项协议承认了前寮国战斗部队在争取民族独立的斗争中建立的功勋。萨纳尼空集团给苏发努冯和七名其他爱国战线党领导人加上的“民族叛徒”的罪名是莫须有的。
    评论说，朝鲜人民同情老挝爱国战线党中央委员会最近向全世界爱好和平人民发出的呼吁，强烈谴责萨纳尼空集团的犯罪阴谋，并且坚决要求立即无条件地释放苏发努冯亲王等老挝爱国者。
    据新华社巴黎30日电　法国共产党中央委员会书记利奥·斐盖尔今天在“人道报”上发表文章抗议老挝政府将对老挝爱国战线党领导人苏发努冯亲王等的非法审讯。他号召法国人坚决要求遵守日内瓦协议，撤销对苏发努冯和他的同事们的控诉并立即释放他们。
    他要求法国人民以个人或集体的名义向老挝政府和老挝驻巴黎大使馆提出抗议。
    斐盖尔谴责老挝当局企图由特别法庭来判处老挝主张民主的人们的重刑，而禁绝民主分子的活动。他揭露，美国利用老挝的局势来加紧进行控制。
    新华社布拉格30日电　捷克斯洛伐克新闻工作者协会30日致电老挝首相萨纳尼空，抗议对老挝爱国民主新闻工作者坎佩·布格特和西萨纳·西山的迫害。
    电文说，对他们的逮捕和对苏发努冯亲王和老挝爱国战线党的其他领导人所布置的整个审讯，是对自由、民主与和平的无原则的进攻。
