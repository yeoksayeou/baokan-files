    White Ash Brick Durable
	The employees of Anshan Brick Factory recently succeeded in using white ash to replace cement in brick making.
    White ash bricks are more durable than cement bricks, with a compressive strength of over 65 kilograms, fully meeting national standards. Its cost is also more than 40% lower than that of cement bricks.
    Great Use for Nickel Smelting Waste
	Shanghai Chemical Station, in its waste recycling work, has discovered that the waste from electrolytic nickel in metal smelting plants can be directly used as raw material for the enamel industry. After trial use by Shanghai Shunfeng, Jiuxin, and other enamel factories, the quality is very good and its use has now been expanded.
    Leather Powder for Shoe Soles
	Leather powder is a kind of waste material in the production of leather shoe factories. Shanghai Chemical Plant used this waste material mixed with polyvinyl chloride to trial-produce a kind of polyvinyl chloride shoe sole. This kind of shoe sole has good tensile strength and wear resistance.
    New Raw Materials for Making Vaseline
	Nanchang City Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine Company Pharmaceutical Factory, successfully used 10% rice bran oil, 68% vegetable oil foot and 22% paraffin wax to prepare Vaseline. Vaseline is a byproduct in the process of refining and distilling petroleum, and is widely used.
    Recover Basic Methylene Blue
	The waste water from pharmaceutical factories manufacturing gentian violet (purple medicine) contains about 10% basic methylene blue. After research, this waste water can be used for dyeing paper and can be used for packaging stamps. Recycling one ton of waste water can save more than 2,000 yuan.
    Peanut Shells Can Be Used to Brew Wine
	Yicheng Distillery in Yixing County, Jiangsu Province, successfully experimented with using thatch roots and peanut shells to brew wine. Every 100 jin of thatch roots produces 17.3 jin of wine, and every 100 jin of peanut shells produces 7.26 jin of wine. Both of these types of white wine are above 55 degrees.

    代用原料到处有  增产节约门路多
    白灰制瓦经久耐用
    鞍山制瓦厂职工最近利用白灰代替水泥制瓦成功。
    白灰瓦比水泥瓦经久耐用，抗压力达到六十五公斤以上，完全合乎国家规定的标准。它的成本也比水泥瓦低40％以上。
    炼镍下脚用途大
    上海化工站在废品回收的工作中，研究出金属冶炼厂电解镍的下脚可以直接用作搪瓷工业的原料。经上海顺风，久新等搪瓷厂试用，质量很好，现已扩大使用。
    皮革粉制鞋底
    皮革粉是皮鞋工厂生产中的一种下脚料。上海化工厂利用这种下脚料与聚氯乙烯混合试制成一种聚氯乙烯皮鞋底。这种鞋底拉断率、耐磨性能都很好。
    制凡士林有新原料
    南昌市中西医药公司制剂厂，利用10％的糠油、68％的植物油脚和22％的石蜡配制凡士林成功。凡士林是提炼蒸馏石油过程中的一种副产品，用途很广。
    回收盐基青莲
    制药厂制造龙胆紫（紫药水）的下脚水里，含有盐基青莲10％左右，经过研究这种下脚水可以染纸，可以作包装盖印。回收一吨下脚水就可节约二千多元。
    花生壳可以酿酒
    江苏省宜兴县宜城酒厂，试验用茅草根和花生壳酿酒成功。每百斤茅草根出酒十七点三斤，每百斤花生壳出酒七点二六斤。这两种白酒，都在五十五度以上。
