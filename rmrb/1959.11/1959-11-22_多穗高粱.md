	Little Knowledge
	Multigrain sorghum originates in South Africa. This type of sorghum has a large root system, strong tillering ability, short, thick, and sturdy stalks, and tight ears. It is not easily lodged by wind, making it suitable for planting in windy coastal and plain areas. The yield per mu is 500-600 jin, with the highest yield reaching over 800 jin, which is one to two times more than ordinary red sorghum (red sorghum yields 200-300 jin per mu).
	In 1947, it was first trial-planted in Hebei, Shandong, Jilin, and other provinces in China, and the yield was very high. This year, it has been widely promoted in more than 20 provinces and cities across the country, with a total planting area of about 7 million mu, accounting for about 30% of the country's sorghum planting area.
	This type of sorghum not only has a high grain yield, but its stalks are also a good source of sugar, generally containing 8% to 12% sugar. The average yield of stalks per mu is 1,500 to 2,000 jin. If half of the country can utilize it this year, it can increase the production of maltose by nearly 400,000 tons and sugar by more than 100,000 tons.
	Now that the sorghum has been harvested, we should seize this favorable opportunity to produce more sugar and maltose.

    多穗高粱
    多穗高粱出产在南非洲，这种高粱根系较大、分蘖力强，茎秆粗矮、坚硬穗紧，遇风不易倒伏，适合于多风的沿海和平原地带栽种。亩产高粱五六百斤，最高产量达到八百多斤，比普通红高粱多产一、二倍（红高粱亩产二百到三百斤）。
    一九四七年，第一次在我国的河北、山东、吉林等省试种，产量很高。今年已在全国二十多个省市普遍推广，全国播种面积七百万亩左右，占全国高粱种植面积的百分之三十左右。
    这种高粱不但籽实产量多，它的茎秆还是很好的糖料，一般含糖分在百分之八到百分之十二。每亩地平均产茎秆一千五到二千斤，今年全国如能利用一半，就可以增产饴糖近四十万吨，产砂糖十万吨以上。
    现在高粱已收割下来，应该抓紧这个有利时机，生产更多的砂糖和饴糖。
