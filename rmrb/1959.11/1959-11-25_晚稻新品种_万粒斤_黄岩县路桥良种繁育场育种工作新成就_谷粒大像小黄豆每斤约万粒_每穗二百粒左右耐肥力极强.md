New Late Rice Variety - "Ten Thousand Grains Per Jin"
    New Achievement in Breeding Work at Luqiao Seed Breeding Farm, Huangyan County
    Grains are Large Like Small Soybeans, Approximately Ten Thousand Grains Per Jin, About Two Hundred Grains Per Panicle, Extremely Resistant to Fertilizer

    (Our Newspaper) This paper reports that a new late rice variety with heavy and numerous grains – Luqiao "Ten Thousand Grains Per Jin" – has been successfully developed at the Luqiao Seed Breeding Farm in Huangyan County, Zhejiang.
    This new rice variety was selected by seed expert Yang Kuangbao and comrades of the seed selection team from a comparative experiment of seventy-nine late rice varieties. This new variety has the following characteristics: the grains are particularly large and heavy, with approximately ten thousand grains per jin. The plant height is about four chi (approximately 4 feet), with some reaching five chi; the plant shape is large at the bottom and small at the top, very similar to wild rice stems, with a diameter of 8.5 millimeters, and the stem wall is about twice as thick as ordinary varieties; the leaves are broad, the leaf color is dark green, and the leaf sheaths are large; the flag leaf stands upright before heading and forms an obtuse angle during the heading and ripening stage, being 50 to 65 centimeters long and 1.5 to 2.5 centimeters wide. The panicle length is about 25 centimeters, with about 200 grains per panicle, with some having as many as 367 grains. The grains are large like small soybeans, and the glumes are light yellow. The thousand-grain weight is 50.1 grams, making it a very important high-quality rice variety in Zhejiang Province. The growing period of this variety in the paddy field is about 200 days. According to the experimental observations of the Luqiao Seed Breeding Farm, it was sown on March 18th, transplanted on April 13th, began tillering in early May, headed in early September, and matured at the end of October. The root system of this rice variety is very developed, extremely resistant to fertilizer, and does not lodge, remaining erect even when mature. The tillering rate is medium; according to the records of the Luqiao Seed Breeding Farm, with a row and plant spacing of 6×8 cun (approximately 6x8 inches), planting one seedling per clump resulted in an average of 11.4 tillers, with an effective tillering rate of over 80%. The disease resistance is also relatively strong; no diseases were found from transplanting to maturity. However, the insect resistance is weak, and the heading is uneven, with inconsistent ripening.
    This year, the Luqiao Seed Breeding Farm only cultivated seventy panicles of "Ten Thousand Grains Per Jin" rice seeds. A great deal of effort was put into these seventy panicles. They had to check on them several times every day. No wonder people laugh at Yang Kuangbao, saying, "A monkey plants ginger, looking around three or four times a day.” To protect this new rice variety, they stood guard every night, sometimes until the latter half of the night. Although they suffered from two floods and the attacks of rice borers, leaf rollers, rice planthoppers, and brown spot disease, they finally overcame the disasters with their careful cultivation and the variety's inherent resistance.
    This year, the Luqiao Seed Breeding Farm has cultivated a total of ten new varieties, all of which have long panicles, numerous grains, and high yields. For example, Luqiao No. 1 has an average of over 400 grains per panicle; Luqiao No. 3 averages 12,700 grains per jin, surpassing ordinary rice. Currently, the breeding farm has kept all these new varieties as seeds, harvested, dried, and stored them separately, with dedicated personnel managing them, and has decided to expand propagation next year and gradually popularize them.

    晚稻新品种——“万粒斤”
    黄岩县路桥良种繁育场育种工作新成就
    谷粒大像小黄豆每斤约万粒  每穗二百粒左右耐肥力极强
    本报讯　浙江黄岩县路桥良种繁育场一种粒重粒多的晚稻新品种——路桥“万粒斤”问世了。
    这种新稻种是种子专家杨匡保和选种小组的同志从七十九个晚稻品种的比较试验中选育出来的。这个新品种，有如下特点：谷粒特别大，份量重，每斤谷子在一万粒左右。株高约四尺，高的达五尺左右；株型下大上小，与茭白极相似，直径八点五毫米，茎壁比一般品种厚一倍左右；叶片阔大，叶色深绿，叶鞘很大；剑叶在抽穗前竖起，抽穗后成熟阶段为钝角，长五十至六十五厘米，阔一点五至二点五厘米。穗长二十五厘米左右，每穗有二百粒左右，多的有三百六十七粒，谷粒大似小黄豆，谷壳淡黄色。千粒重五十点一克，是浙江省最重要的一个水稻优良品种。这种品种本田生育期二百天左右。据路桥良种繁育场的试验观察，在3月18日播种，4月13日插秧，5月上旬分蘖，9月初抽穗，10月底成熟。这种稻种的根系很发达，耐肥力极强，不倒伏，在成熟的时候仍然矗立着。分蘖率中等，据路桥良种场的记载，6×8寸的行株距，每丛插一株，平均分蘖十一点四根，有效分蘖率在80％以上。抗病力也较强，从移植到成熟期间，没有发现任何病害；但抗虫力较弱，并且抽穗不整齐，成熟很不一致。
    今年，路桥良种繁育场培育的“万粒斤”稻种只有七十个稻穗。这七十个稻穗花的心血可真大。每天他们总要去看几次，难怪人家笑杨匡保是：猢狲种姜，一日三四张（张望）。”为了保护这种新稻种，他们夜夜站岗，有时一站就到下半夜。后来虽遭两次洪水和钻心虫、卷叶虫、稻飞虱、斑点病的侵袭，但在他们精心培育下，加上该品种本身的抗逆力，终于战胜了灾害。
    今年，路桥良种繁育场共培育出十个新品种，这些新品种，都是穗长粒多，产量高。如路桥一号每穗平均在四百粒以上；路桥三号平均每一万二千七百粒重一斤，超过一般稻子。目前，繁育场已把这些新品种全部留作种子，单收、单晒、单藏、专人保管，决定明年扩大繁育，逐步普及。（附图片）
