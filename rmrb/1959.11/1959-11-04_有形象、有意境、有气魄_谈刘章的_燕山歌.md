With Imagery, Poetic Conception, and Vigor
    ——On Liu Zhang's "Yanshan Song"
  　Ke Yusheng
    The peasant poet Liu Zhang's "Yanshan Song" (published by Baihua Literature and Art Publishing House) is a relatively excellent collection of poems. Comrade Liu Zhang is from Zhongtian Township, Xinglong County, Hebei Province. He studied in senior high school for over a year and is only twenty years old this year. He grew up in the countryside, participated in agricultural labor, worked in the commune's cultural center, and has recently taken on teaching duties.
    When the Great Leap Forward began, Comrade Liu Zhang was laboring in his hometown. He saw the peasants' tireless and selfless energy day and night, and witnessed the tremendous changes in his hometown, feeling he had a bellyful of words to express. So he opened his loud voice to
  “sing the happy song of his heart.” He touched on a wide and deep range of subjects, and under the same theme he could sing many songs, each with its own color. Let us listen to his "Yanshan Song"!
      Yanshan peaks, pierce the sky,
      Yanshan waters, waves rise high,
      Move Yanshan to make a great dam,
      Hold Yanshan water to hang on the mountain waist.
              ——"Yanshan Song"
    What a vivid epitome of the Yanshan farmers' Great Leap Forward! The first two lines depict the towering mountains and deep waters, while the latter two lines outline the Yanshan farmers' magnificent spirit of transforming nature. They are not afraid of the difficulty of high mountains and deep waters, moving mountains to build dams and leading water to climb mountains. Who would not find these Yanshan people respectable and lovable after reading such a poem?
      Not allowing the moon to wane again,
      Not allowing the sun to slip down the mountain,
      The Great Leap Forward makes the Earth seem small,
      Next year, scattering seeds in the sky.
                      ——"Scattering Seeds in the Sky"
    What a wonderful and bold imagination! The bright full moon casts silver light, illuminating the earth as bright as day, and the fiery red sun hangs high in the sky forever, not allowing the darkness to descend. This is because the people of the Great Leap Forward feel that time is not enough. And it doesn't stop there! Inspired by their efforts, people feel the Earth is too small. In the scientific age of satellites in the sky, they naturally dare to have the idea of ​​finding a new continent.
    Songs fill the fields, poems cover the walls,
    Every poem shames the Jade Emperor,
    The Jade Emperor drives the clouds to argue,
    The clouds hang on the sorghum stalks.
              ——"Every Poem Shames the Jade Emperor"
    Judging from the arrangement of the first three lines, one could infer that the author intends to praise the multitude and quality of the masses' poems. But in the fourth line, he turns his pen and points out the miracle of the bumper harvest. The clouds in the sky are hanging on the sorghum stalks. Just imagine how well the sorghum must be growing! This turn is very natural, as if casually picked up. This turn is full of fun, cleverly reflecting the simultaneous harvest of production and culture in the new countryside. This is a unique artistic conception.
    I would also like to briefly discuss "The Song of Five Phoenix Mountain". This is the longest poem in the collection, with more than one hundred and sixty lines. The first chapter describes the heroic deeds of five heroes who defended the mountain top during the Anti-Japanese War and sacrificed themselves by jumping off the cliff. In people's legends, they live forever: "Five people turned into colorful phoenixes, flying up to the ninth heaven." The second chapter describes the Great Leap Forward in the countryside, where the masses built five reservoirs on the mountain, celebrating the harvest in autumn and cherishing the memory of the martyrs: "Looking up at the blue sky, five phoenixes circle the mountain." The legend of the five phoenixes is like a red thread connecting the two chapters. Although the poem is based on the legend of the five phoenixes, it is not bound by the legend. The author focuses on describing the momentum of the Great Leap Forward in the new countryside on the basis of writing about revolutionary legends. The contrast between the past and present enhances the theme of the work.
    Most of the "Yanshan Song" poems are pieces with imagery, poetic conception, and vigor, shining like pearls. The author's imagination is particularly rich, and the conception is full of strong legendary style, which is fascinating. The language is concise, fresh, and simple, without any traces of deliberate carving, as natural as if spoken spontaneously, easy to understand at first hearing, yet hard to forget after reading.
    "Yanshan Song" is the author's first collection, compiling a total of fifty-eight short poems and one longer poem, all written last year during the labor of the Great Leap Forward. From this, it can be seen that the author is diligent and hardworking in amateur writing, and he is also very talented in poetry creation. But at the same time, it can also be seen that the author's artistic cultivation is obviously not yet mature. Some chapters have not escaped generalization in their conception, some images are not accurately obtained, and there is still room for improvement in the use of rhyme and control of words.
    Comrade Liu Zhang is still in his hometown, writing under the care of the Party, and growing up under the encouragement of the masses. It is hoped that he will not be proud when galloping on the road of creation, and will not be discouraged when encountering obstacles of high mountains and deep waters. He should take the spirit of the Yanshan people to conquer nature, overcome all difficulties, and move forward forever.

### 有形象、有意境、有气魄——谈刘章的“燕山歌”

    有形象、有意境、有气魄
    ——谈刘章的“燕山歌”
  　柯玉生
    农民诗人刘章的“燕山歌”（百花文艺出版社出版），是一本比较优秀的诗集。刘章同志是河北省兴隆县中田乡人，曾经念过一年多高中，今年才满二十岁，他生长在农村，参加过农业劳动，在公社做过文化馆工作，新近又担任了教学。
    大跃进开始的时候，刘章同志正在家乡劳动，他眼见农民不计昼夜、不分日月的冲天干劲，目睹家乡的巨大变化，觉得有一肚子话要往外说，于是他放开响亮的嗓子
  “唱起心头的幸福歌来。他触及的题材广而且深，同一题下他能唱出许多歌来，每支歌都各有自己的色泽。让我们听听他的“燕山歌”吧！
      燕山峰，穿九霄，
      燕山水，波浪高，
      搬来燕山当大坝，
      手提燕水挂山腰。
              ——“燕山歌”
    好一幅燕山农民跃进的缩影！头两句画出了山高水深的景象，后两句又勾出燕山农民改造自然的磅礴气概，他们不畏山高水深之难，移山作坝，引水登山，谁读了这样的诗会不觉得这些燕山人可敬可爱？
      不准月亮再缺边，
      不准太阳溜下山，
      跃进显得地球小，
      明年把种撒上天。
                      ——“把种撒上天”
    多么奇妙、大胆的想像！皎洁的圆月放银光，大地照得通明如昼，火红的太阳永悬高空，不让黑夜降临。这是因为跃进的人们感觉时间不够用。还不止此哩！鼓足干劲的人们感觉地球太小，在卫星上天的科学时代，自然就敢于产生另寻新大陆的念头。
    歌声遍野诗满墙，
    句句诗歌羞玉皇，
    玉皇驾云来争辩，
    云彩挂在高粱上。
              ——“句句诗歌羞玉皇”
    从头三句布局看，本可臆断作者旨在赞许群众的诗歌又多又好。但到第四句上，他却一转笔锋，又把庄稼丰收的奇迹点出来了。空中的云彩都挂在高粱上，你想想看那高粱该长得有多好！这一转转得非常自然，如同信手拈来的一样。这一转转得趣味横生，巧妙地反映出了新农村生产文化齐丰收。这是一种别出心裁的艺术构思。
    我还想略微谈一下“五凤山的歌”。这是集中最长的一首，有一百六十多行。头一章是写抗日战争时期，五位英雄汉坚守山巅、跳岩壮烈牺牲的事迹，在人们的传说里，他们永远活着“五人变彩凤，飞上九重天”。后一章是写大跃进的农村，群众在山上修起五座水库，秋来欢庆丰收，心间怀念先烈“抬头望青天，五凤围山转”。五只凤的传说，像一根红线贯连在两章里。诗虽然是以五只凤的传说作基础，但并没有被传说束缚住，作者在写革命传说的基础上，着重描述了新农村大跃进的气势，今昔相辉交映之下，更加增强了作品的主题思想。
    “燕山歌”里，大部分都是有形象，有意境，有气魄的篇什，像颗颗珍珠闪射光芒。作者的想像力特别丰富，构思又富有强烈的传奇格调，能引人入胜。语言是凝炼的，清新的，朴素的，没有刻意雕琢的痕迹，自然得好像脱口而出，浅近到一听就懂，却又过目久难忘怀。
    “燕山歌”是作者的第一个集子，共收编了五十八首短诗和一首较长的诗，全是去年在大跃进的劳动中写的。由此可见，作者在业余写作方面是辛勤的、努力的，他在诗歌创作方面也是很有才华的。但同时也从中看到，作者在艺术修养方面显然还不成熟，有的篇章构思未脱一般化，有的形象取得不准确，在运用韵律和驾驭文字方面都还有待提高。
    刘章同志至今仍在家乡，在党的关怀下写作，在群众的鼓舞下成长。希望他在创作道路上奔驰时切莫骄傲，遇到高山深水的屏障也莫气馁，拿出燕山人民征服自然的精神，克服一切困难，永远前进。
