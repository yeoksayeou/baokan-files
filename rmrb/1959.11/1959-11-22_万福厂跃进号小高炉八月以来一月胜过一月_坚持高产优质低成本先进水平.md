From our newspaper in Chongqing on the 21st: In the mountains of Da County, Sichuan Province, the nationally renowned Wanfu Iron and Steel Plant's Yuejin No. 1 Small Blast Furnace has consistently maintained an advanced level of high yield, high quality, and low cost with a low coke ratio since August, improving month by month.

This small blast furnace achieved an average utilization coefficient of over three in October, with the coke ratio reduced to below 0.9, a pig iron qualification rate of 96%, and costs lowered to the advanced level of large blast furnaces. In October, it overfulfilled its monthly plan by 75.3%, thirteen days ahead of schedule. It fully achieved the targets of its competition with small local blast furnaces nationwide. In the first half of November, despite difficulties such as insufficient coke supply, the utilization coefficient remained stable above three tons.

The Yuejin No. 1 Small Blast Furnace was put into production on July 1st of last year and has a volume of three cubic meters. The complete set of equipment for the small blast furnace is composed of scrap and used materials. The ore and coke used are small slag pieces screened from the waste ore and coke that large blast furnaces do not use. Most of the smelting workers were farmers last year. However, the soaring enthusiasm and talent of the smelting workers have ensured that this small blast furnace produces iron quickly, abundantly, well, and economically. Under the leadership of the factory's Party committee, they first overcame a large amount of right-leaning thought, such as "small blast furnaces cannot implement high-wind operation," "old equipment cannot be risked," and "small blast furnaces have short furnace bodies, short smelting cycles, and high direct reduction, so high output is possible, but high quality is not." They broke through some outdated rules and regulations, continuously improved equipment, continuously innovated operating techniques, and adhered to the smelting operation policy of "increasing smelting intensity and reducing coke ratio."

In the production process, the workers confirmed from practical experience that this small blast furnace is a relatively reasonable furnace type suitable for high-wind, rapid smelting. However, there were still some unresolved issues with the equipment and operation. Therefore, they carried out a series of technical innovations during and after the major furnace overhaul in July and August this year, solving this problem. Before the furnace overhaul, due to attention to high wind but not high temperature, the sulfur content was high, and the quality of pig iron was poor. During the overhaul, the heating area of the furnace was expanded, and a tubular hot blast stove with a heating area of ​​25 square meters was expanded to 55 square meters. Subsequently, a new tubular hot blast stove with a heating area of ​​55 square meters was added. In this way, the wind temperature increased from 260 to 280 degrees Celsius to 480 to 500 degrees Celsius, which played a very important role in increasing the furnace load, reducing the coke ratio, and improving the output and quality of pig iron. In addition, the workers also changed the furnace's original two tuyere air inlets to four tuyere air inlets, and installed a wind gate on each tuyere. When changing the wind nozzle, only the wind gate needs to be closed, and other tuyeres can continue to inject air, which accelerates coke combustion and keeps the furnace at high-temperature smelting. Continuous improvements have also been made in important equipment such as gas rising pipes.

While boldly improving the equipment, the workers paid more attention to learning advanced experience and continuously innovating in operating techniques. They meticulously implemented the advanced operating methods of diligent observation, diligent analysis, diligent handling, diligent maintenance, and combining the upper and lower parts of the furnace for adjustment. While increasing the wind temperature, the workers also explored a more suitable charging system for this small blast furnace after the major overhaul, that is, first laying a layer of coke in the charging bell, then laying ore and semi-quicklime, and finally laying another layer of coke, a one-time charging system. This fully utilized the gas, increased the carbon dioxide content from 8% to 9% to 11% to 12%, and reduced the furnace top temperature from above 300 degrees Celsius to about 250 degrees Celsius, correspondingly increasing the furnace hearth temperature. They also explored the experience of appropriately increasing the flux, increasing the slag basicity from the original 0.9 to about 1.2, greatly enhancing the desulfurization efficiency in the furnace. As the air volume increased and the wind temperature increased, the number of iron tapping times also changed from three to four times per shift to four to six times, up to eight times, accelerating the charging speed and correspondingly increasing the output.

In addition, the workers also created a complete set of experience in strengthening raw material and fuel management. That is, according to the principle of targeted supply, the mines and coal mines were fixed, so that the chemical composition of the raw fuel was relatively stable; at the same time, great attention was also paid to ore dressing work. The iron content of the ore entering these small blast furnaces reached more than 60% through manual beneficiation.

    万福厂跃进号小高炉八月以来一月胜过一月
    坚持高产优质低成本先进水平
    本报重庆21日电　在四川省达县专区的丛山峻岭中，全国著名的万福钢铁厂跃进号小高炉，从8月份以来，一直坚持了高产、优质、低成本、低焦比的先进水平，并且一月胜过一月。
    这座小高炉10月份平均利用系数达到三以上，焦比降低到零点九以下，生铁合格率96％，成本也降低到大高炉的先进水平。10月份，超额75.3％提前十三天完成了全月计划。全面实现了它和全国小洋高炉竞赛的指标。11月上半月在焦炭供应不足等困难情况下，利用系数仍稳定在三吨以上。
    跃进号小高炉是去年7月1日投入生产的，容积三立方米。小高炉的全套设备是废旧物组成的，所用的矿石和焦炭，是大高炉不用的碎矿、碎焦中筛出来的小渣块。大部分冶炼工人在去年还是农民。但是，冶炼工人们的冲天干劲和才能智慧，保证了这座小高炉又多又快又好又省的炼出铁来了。他们在工厂党委的领导下，首先战胜了所谓“小高炉不能实行大风操作”、“旧设备不能冒险”、“小高炉炉身矮，冶炼周期短、直接还原多，高产还可以，优质就不行”等一大堆右倾思想，突破一些陈规陋矩，不断改进设备，不断革新操作技术，坚持了“提高冶炼强度和降低焦比”的冶炼操作方针。
    在生产过程中，工人们从实际经验证实：这座小高炉是适合大风、快速冶炼的比较合理的炉型。但是设备和操作上还有一些问题没有解决。因此他们便在今年7、8月份炉子大修中和大修后，进行了一系列的技术革新，解决了这个问题。炉子大修前，由于注意了大风，不注意高温，因而含硫高，生铁质量不好。大修中，便扩大炉子受热面积，将一座受热面积二十五平方米的管式热风炉，扩建为五十五平方米，以后，又新增一座受热面积五十五平方米的管式热风炉。这样，风温就由摄氏二百六十度到二百八十度，提高到四百八十度到五百度，这对加重炉子负荷，降低焦比，提高生铁产量和质量起到了极重要的作用。此外，工人们还将炉子原来只有两个风口进风，改为四个风口进风，并在每个风口上安了风闸，换风咀时只需关上风闸，别的风口仍可继续进风，这样便加速了焦炭燃烧，使炉子保持高温冶炼。在煤气上升管等重要设备方面，也不断进行了改进。
    在大胆改进设备的同时，工人们更注意在操作技术上学习先进经验，不断革新。他们细致地贯彻了勤观察、勤分析、勤处理、勤维护、炉子的上部和下部调剂相结合的先进操作法。工人们在提高风温的同时，又摸索出了这座小高炉大修后比较适合的装料制度，即是在料钟内先铺一层焦，再铺矿石和半生石灰，最后又铺一层焦炭，一次放下的装料制度。这就使煤气得到了充分利用，二氧化碳的含量由8％至9％，上升到11％至12％，炉顶温度由摄氏三百度以上降低到二百五十度左右，相应地提高了炉缸温度。他们还摸索出适当增加熔剂的经验，把炉渣碱度由原来零点九提高到一点二左右，大大增强了炉内脱硫效能。随着风量增大，风温提高，放铁次数也由每班三到四次改为四到六次，最多达八次，加快了走料速度，相应地增加了产量。
    此外，在加强原料和燃料管理方面，工人们也创造了成套经验。即是按照对口供应的原则，固定了矿井和煤井，致使原燃料的化学成份比较稳定；同时还十分注意选矿工作，这些小高炉入炉矿石的含铁量，通过手工精选高达60％以上。
