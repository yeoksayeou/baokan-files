Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 24th - Agricultural middle schools in Shandong Province are flourishing. By the end of September, the number of agricultural middle schools in the province had increased from 760 in the first half of the year to 1,379, and the number of students had increased from more than 44,000 to more than 134,000.

The local Party committees and commune members all place part of their hope for training agricultural mechanization, water conservancy, chemicalization, and electrification technicians on the agricultural middle schools, and are determined to run the agricultural middle schools well.

Under the leadership of the local Party committees, the agricultural middle schools in various places have actively implemented the Party's policy of education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor since they were opened more than a year ago. They have achieved great results in teaching, productive labor, and scientific research. The examination results of agricultural middle school students are generally no less than those of neighboring ordinary middle schools. When Wang Feng Agricultural Middle School in Guanxian County and an ordinary middle school took the same test at the same time, the number of agricultural middle school students with excellent and good grades accounted for 89.6% of the total number of students, and none failed. The crops planted on the production bases of many agricultural middle schools have also achieved bumper harvests. The sorghum planted by the Shankou Agricultural Middle School in Tai'an this year had an average yield of 650 jin per mu, the spring corn had an average yield of 550 jin per mu, the millet had a maximum yield of 940 jin per mu, and the average yield of grain crops throughout the year was 871 jin per mu. The wheat yield of Yucheng Agricultural Middle School in Yidu reached 840 jin per mu, and it was awarded the title of wheat high-yield unit in the special zone. The production bases of some agricultural middle schools have become experimental fields for the Party committee. At present, all agricultural middle schools have their own farms, with an average of three-tenths of a mu per person at a minimum, and generally about half a mu.

Many agricultural middle schools have also carried out some sideline production in connection with their studies, and have established breeding farms, etc. Due to the increase in agricultural and sideline income, more than one-third of the agricultural middle schools in the province are now self-sufficient, and teachers' salaries, students' living expenses, and office expenses are all paid by the schools themselves, and some even have a surplus; some schools have achieved half self-sufficiency and partial self-sufficiency, which has played a great role in consolidating the agricultural middle schools.

Agricultural middle schools closely link teaching with practical production, and students' cultural knowledge and production skills have improved rapidly. At the same time, they have also carried out some scientific research activities. Now, agricultural middle school students have generally learned many new technologies for planting, managing, and harvesting crops, and have spread them to various production teams, becoming an important technical force in local agricultural production. When Sunjia Agricultural Middle School in Penglai County planted various fruit trees on a barren hilly land, it combined this with 52 kinds of fruit tree grafting, and basically successfully researched grape cultivation for four blooms and four fruits in one year. Nanwang Agricultural Middle School used asexual hybridization to cross Chinese wheat with Soviet wheat, and experimented with more than a dozen varieties such as Sino-Soviet No. 1 to "12". Lutou Agricultural Middle School fertilized Chinese cabbage outside the roots to stimulate cabbage cell division, increasing production by three to four jin per plant.

Many agricultural middle school students have learned to master modern agricultural machinery. Twenty students from Yucheng Agricultural Middle School in Yidu and Chengguan Agricultural Middle School in Jiaoxian County have become tractor drivers for the commune.

The agricultural middle schools in various places have received enthusiastic support from the commune members. The commune members have sent their children to school, helping the agricultural middle schools solve difficulties such as school buildings, teaching aids, and production tools.

    学习生产科学研究样样好
    山东农业中学蓬勃发展
    新华社济南24日电　山东省的农业中学蓬勃发展，到9月底止，全省农业中学由上半年的七百六十处发展为一千三百七十九处，学生由四万四千多人发展到十三万四千多人。
    各地党委和人民公社社员都把培养农业机械化、水利化、化学化、电气化技术人员的一部分希望，寄托在农业中学身上，决心要把农业中学办好。
    各地农业中学在当地党委领导下，开办一年多来，积极贯彻党的教育为无产阶级的政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，在教学、生产劳动、科学研究等方面，都取得了很大的成绩。农业中学学生的考试成绩一般都不亚于邻近的普通中学。冠县王奉农业中学和普通中学用同样题目、在同一时间进行测验时，农业中学学生成绩优良的占总人数的89.6％，没有一个不及格。许多农业中学生产基地上种植的作物都获得了丰收。泰安山口农业中学种植的高粱今年平均亩产六百五十斤，春玉米平均亩产五百五十斤，谷子最高亩产九百四十斤，全年粮食作物平均亩产八百七十一斤。益都古城农业中学，小麦亩产达到八百四十斤，获得专区小麦丰产单位的称号。有些地区农业中学的生产基地，已经成为党委的试验田。当前，所有农业中学都有自己的农场，少者平均每人三分，一般的都在半亩左右。
    许多农业中学还结合学习课程，进行了一些副业生产，建立起饲养场等。由于农副业收入增多，现在全省农业中学有三分之一以上达到自给，教师工资、学生生活费、办公费等都由学校自付，有的甚至有节余；有的学校达到了半自给和部分自给，这对农中的巩固起了很大作用。
    农业中学在教学中密切联系生产实际，学生的文化知识和生产技能提高很快，同时还进行了一部分科学研究活动。现在，农业中学的学生一般都学会了许多农作物种植、管理、收获等新技术，并且向各生产队进行传播，成了各地农业生产中一支重要的技术力量。蓬莱县孙家农业中学在一块瘠薄的丘岭地上种植各种果树时，结合进行了五十二种果树嫁接，基本研究成功葡萄一年四花四果。南旺农业中学用无性杂交的方法利用我国小麦和苏联小麦杂交，试验成了中苏一号——“十二”号等十几个品种。芦头农业中学对大白菜进行根外施肥，刺激白菜细胞分裂，每棵增产三至四斤。
    许多农业中学的学生已学会掌握现代化的农业机械了。益都古城农业中学和胶县城关农业中学各有二十名学生，已成为公社的拖拉机驾驶员。
    各地农业中学受到社员群众们的热情支援。社员们纷纷送自己的子女入学，帮助农业中学解决校舍、教具和生产工具等困难。
