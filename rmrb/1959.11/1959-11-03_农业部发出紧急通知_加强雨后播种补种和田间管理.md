Xinhua News Agency, November 1st. From October 30th to November 1st, the provinces in the Yellow River, Huai River, and Yangtze River basins experienced widespread welcome rain, with most areas thoroughly soaked. The drought in the original drought-affected areas has been largely alleviated, which is extremely beneficial for autumn and winter sowing. To this end, the Ministry of Agriculture issued an emergency notice today, requiring the areas that have received rain to seize the favorable opportunity to push the sowing of winter wheat, rapeseed, and miscellaneous grains, as well as field management, to a new high.

The notice requires:

	1. All areas in the Yangtze and Huai River basins must seize the favorable opportunity after the rain to rush-cultivate, rush-sow, and transplant rapeseed. Ensure the timely completion of the autumn and winter planting plan, and strive to exceed it.

	2. In areas where sowing has already taken place but seedlings are incomplete due to drought, resowing should be carried out as soon as possible while the soil is still moist.

	3. If the ground becomes crusted after the rain, the soil should be loosened in a timely manner to facilitate emergence and growth.

	4. This rain is extremely beneficial for the growth of overwintering crops that have already emerged. It is necessary to seize the favorable opportunity to strengthen seedling management, take action early, and eliminate third-class seedlings. In a few areas where rainfall is excessive, attention should be paid to clearing ditches and draining water to prevent waterlogging.

	5. All areas must seize the opportunity to store and conserve water, preparing sufficient water sources for winter and spring irrigation.
