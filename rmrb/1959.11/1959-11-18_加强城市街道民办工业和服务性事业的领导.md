Strengthen the Leadership of Urban Street-Run Industries and Service Undertakings
By People's Daily Commentator

In 1958, during the vigorous mass movement of the Great Leap Forward in socialist construction, urban street-run industries across the country saw great development. According to incomplete statistics from twenty-two large and medium-sized cities, including Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Harbin, after rectification and reorganization, there are now over 19,500 street-run factories (groups), with over 750,000 members. They produce thousands of products, with an output value of 600 million yuan in the first half of this year. This is a new social productive force that must be taken seriously. At the same time, in the past six months, various cities have organized many service stations, carrying out a variety of service activities (such as washing and repairing clothes, purchasing and selling daily necessities on behalf of others, handling short-distance transportation, etc.). This is a new form of organizing and educating residents to engage in self-service, which is very popular among residents and workers; it is also an aspect of implementing the mass line in commercial work, service work, and small-scale industry, facilitating industrial and commercial departments to understand the needs of the masses and rationally organize production and supply.

Over the past year, various localities have carried out rectification and partial reorganization of street-run industries and service undertakings, and many enterprises have reached a considerable scale.

It should be affirmed that the achievements of street-run industries and service undertakings are enormous. However, some people ideologically look down on street-run industries; some believe that street-run industries and service stations are "trifles" with "little economic value," dispensable and not worthy of attention; some lack sufficient understanding of the spiritual transformation of street residents and the political and economic significance of transforming urban streets through organizing production and service labor; some exaggerate the problems and shortcomings in development; all of these understandings are incorrect.

The development of street-run industries and service undertakings has further mobilized the positive factors in cities to serve socialism, increased the production of daily-use handicrafts, supported local state-owned industries and state-owned commerce, improved the economic lives of residents, and provided new content for street work. By organizing residents from all walks of life in the streets through these productive and service labors, it is more conducive for us to organize and guide the economic life of urban residents, uniformly arrange labor resources, and conduct socialist education among them. Therefore, under the overall arrangements and unified deployment of the local Party committee, we must actively support and strengthen leadership, and continue to rectify and improve. Taking a negative attitude of pouring cold water or negation is incorrect.

According to the experience provided at the recent conference held in Harbin by the Central Administration for Industry and Commerce, to strengthen the leadership of street-run industries and service undertakings, the following specific issues need to be resolved:

First, street-run industries are part of handicraft production and a powerful assistant to local state-owned industries. Their production and service direction should start from the requirement of filling gaps and making up for deficiencies, actively develop a variety of small commodities that are inexpensive and of good quality; vigorously carry out repair, mending, sewing, and weaving services for people's daily lives; process and repair parts and semi-finished products for state-owned industries, and repair some agricultural machinery and tools; and engage in the production of export handicrafts or raw materials. As for what to run, what to run more, and what to run less in the future, each locality should comprehensively plan and rationally arrange according to specific conditions. However, those products that modern industry can already satisfy social needs and those that compete with modern industry for raw materials should not be run.

Second, the scale of street-run factories should not be too large, and the characteristics of handicrafts, which are small and flexible, should be promoted. The organizational form of enterprises should take into account the large number of housewives among the production members. Some can be produced centrally; some can be produced in a decentralized manner under unified leadership; some can be issued raw materials and produced at home, with finished products collected; some can also adopt a combination of centralized and decentralized forms. The network and points of repair and service industries should be rationally distributed, and an appropriate number of personnel should also be organized to go through the streets and alleys, delivering goods to the door and providing door-to-door service.

Third, street-run industries should actively carry out the movement to increase production and practice economy, continuously improve skills, improve tools, pay attention to improving quality, reduce costs, save raw materials, and expand product varieties according to social needs. Actively establish a management system for socialist enterprises. Pay attention to preventing the tendency to unilaterally pursue output value and profit, and resolutely oppose capitalist business ideology and work style.

The production and sales of street-run industries should be actively arranged according to the supply of raw materials and materials, and according to the requirements of local industry serving large industry, serving agricultural production, serving the people's lives, and serving exports.

Fourth, the economic nature of street-run industries is basically socialist collective ownership. For a considerable period, maintaining the nature of collective ownership in the vast majority of enterprises is conducive to further mobilizing the enthusiasm of the masses and developing production.

A small number of enterprises, if the state really needs them, can also be changed to municipal or district-owned enterprises. However, in the process of enterprise reorganization, outstanding issues should be properly handled, and one should not only focus on the essence and discard the burden; one should prevent the practice of leaving the old, weak, sick, and disabled to the streets.

Fifth, the distribution of profits in street-run industries should be based on the principle of being conducive to expanding reproduction and being conducive to mobilizing the enthusiasm of producers, and should be treated differently and rationally distributed according to different situations such as enterprise size, strength of foundation, and amount of profit; if the municipal or district competent business authorities need to retain a percentage, the proportion should not be too large.

In terms of financial management, the district and street should not control too much or too rigidly.

Sixth, the wages of members of street-run factories should implement the principle of distribution according to work, and overcome the phenomena of inverting the importance of work and egalitarianism. At present, because the labor productivity of street-run industries is generally still very low, the wage level should be lower than that of local state-owned industries. The wage form can adopt a variety of forms according to the production characteristics of the enterprise, such as time-based, time-based plus bonus, piece-rate, or divided wages; some repair and service personnel who go through the streets and alleys can also adopt the method of profit sharing or assuming their own profits and losses.

On the basis of production development, the streets and enterprises should gradually establish some collective welfare facilities (such as canteens, nurseries, etc.) according to the principle of prioritizing urgent needs over general needs and prioritizing collective needs over individual needs. The standards of welfare benefits in enterprises can be allowed to be different between enterprises, but the difference should not be too large, provided that it does not exceed the principle of local state-owned industries.

Seventh, the source of funds for street-run industries is mostly the fundraising of employees' families, as well as some funds from handicraftsmen and small vendors, and only a very small number of capitalists have invested some means of production. Organizing street-run industries has a positive effect on mobilizing and organizing the masses' material and financial resources to develop production. At present, some regions have been or are gradually returning the masses' fundraising. In this regard, various localities can formulate measures for the masses' fundraising to develop production according to the situation, and there is no need to rush to return the masses' fundraising, in order to facilitate the development of production.

Eighth, the service items and methods of street service stations should be flexible and diverse to meet the diverse needs of the masses. We must continuously improve the quality of service, and not simply focus on profits. As for the wages and benefits of service personnel, they should generally not exceed the level of other undertakings run by the streets.

Ninth, we must strengthen the work of uniting, educating, and transforming small capitalists, small business owners, and their families in enterprises, give full play to their expertise, and actively help them to carry out self-education and self-transformation in serving socialist construction.

For landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, they should be placed under the supervision of the masses and transformed through productive labor. Those who still occupy leadership positions in enterprises should be transferred, but they should not be purged. In short, a strict distinction should be drawn with them politically, and remuneration should be paid according to work economically.

Tenth, organizing street residents to participate in productive and service labor is a major content of the current urban street work. It is both economic work and political work. Through this work, we can promote the development of other street work. Therefore, all aspects of work must cooperate and coordinate, avoiding each going its own way and neglecting one thing for another.

Strengthen the Party's leadership over street-run industries and service undertakings. Under the unified leadership of the Party, the street office should be the main body, combined with the municipal and district competent business departments, and implement dual leadership. The competent business departments are responsible for planning and balancing and business and technical guidance; the street office is responsible for the management of specific production and business, and political and ideological work. The division of labor of the competent business departments is: productive and repair-related activities are the responsibility of the handicraft department; service undertakings are the responsibility of the commercial department. The administrative departments for industry and commerce should, in conjunction with relevant units, strengthen the administrative management of purchasing, sales activities, product prices, and quality, crack down on speculative illegal activities, implement the policy of transforming private enterprises, and strengthen the publicity and education of Party and state policies.

Urban street-run industries and service undertakings are new social productive forces. To do a good job in this area of organization and leadership, the relevant leadership should give sufficient attention.

    加强城市街道民办工业和服务性事业的领导
    本报评论员
    1958年，在社会主义建设事业大跃进的轰轰烈烈的群众运动中，全国各城市的街道民办工业有很大的发展。仅据北京、天津、上海、哈尔滨等二十二个大、中城市不完全的统计，经过整顿、改组，现有街道民办工厂（组）一万九千五百多单位，成员七十五万余人。生产的产品有上千种，今年上半年的产值达六亿元。这是一支必须重视的新生的社会生产力量。同时，近半年来，各个城市的街道组织了很多服务站，开展了多种多样的服务性活动（如洗补衣物、代购代销生活用品、代办短途运输等等）。这是组织和教育居民进行自我服务的新形式，很受广大居民和职工群众的欢迎；也是商业工作、服务工作和小型工业贯彻群众路线的一个方面，便于工商部门了解群众需要，合理组织生产和供应。
    一年来，各地对街道民办工业和服务事业都进行了整顿和部分的改组，很多企业已经具有相当规模。
    应当肯定，街道民办工业和服务事业的成绩是巨大的。但是，有些人在思想上看不起街道民办工业；有的认为街道民办工业和服务站是“小玩意”，“经济价值不大”，可有可无，不予重视；有的对于通过组织生产和服务劳动，可以逐步改变街道居民的精神面貌和改造城市街道的政治意义和经济作用都认识不足；有的对发展中的一些问题和缺点，过于夸大；以上这些认识都是不对的。
    街道民办工业和服务事业的发展，进一步调动了城市中的积极因素为社会主义服务，增加了日用手工业品的生产，支援了地方国营工业和国营商业，改善了居民的经济生活，并且使街道工作有了新的内容。通过这些生产和服务性的劳动，把分散在街道中的各阶层居民组织起来，这就更有利于我们组织和指导城市居民的经济生活，统一安排劳动力和对他们进行社会主义教育。因此，必须在当地党委的全面安排和统一部署下，积极扶持、加强领导，并继续进行整顿和提高。采取消极泼冷水或者否定的态度都是不对的。
    根据中央工商行政管理局最近在哈尔滨召开的会议上提供的经验，要加强对街道民办工业和服务事业的领导，有以下的几个具体问题需要解决。
    第一、街道民办工业是手工业生产的一部分，是地方国营工业的有力助手，它的生产和服务方向，应该从拾遗补缺的要求出发，积极发展多种多样、价廉物美的小商品；大力开展为人民日常生活服务的修、补、缝、织等业务；为国营工业加工、修配部件和半成品，修理一些农业机械、工具；搞一些出口手工艺品或者原料生产。至于今后各地要办些什么，多办什么少办什么，还应根据具体条件，全面规划，合理安排。但是，现代工业的产品已经能够满足社会需要以及同现代工业争原料的，就不要办了。
    第二、街道民办工厂的规模不宜过大，要发扬手工业的小而灵活的特点。企业的组织形式，要兼顾生产成员中家庭妇女多的特点。有的可以集中生产；有的可以统一领导，分散生产；有的可以发给原料、在家生产、收回成品；有的也可以采取集中与分散相结合的形式。修理服务业的网和点要合理分布，还应该组织适当数量的人员游街串巷，送货上门，服务到户。
    第三、街道民办工业要积极开展增产节约运动，不断提高技艺，改进工具，注意提高质量，降低成本，节约原材料，根据社会需要，扩大产品品种。积极建立社会主义企业的经营管理制度。注意防止片面追求产值、利润的倾向，坚决反对资本主义经营思想和作风。
    对街道民办工业的产销工作，应当根据原料材料的供应状况，根据地方工业为大工业服务、为农业生产服务、为人民生活服务、为出口服务的要求，进行积极安排。
    第四、街道民办工业的经济性质，基本上是社会主义的集体所有制。在一个相当长的时期内，使绝大部分企业保持集体所有制的性质，对于进一步调动群众的积极性、发展生产是有利的。
    少数企业，如果国家确有需要，也可以改为市属或区属企业，但是，在企业改组过程中，应该妥善处理遗留问题，不要只抓精华，丢包袱；应防止把老、弱、病、残人员留给街道的做法。
    第五、街道民办工业盈利的分配，应当根据有利于扩大再生产和有利于调动生产者的积极性的原则，结合企业规模大小、基础强弱、利润大小等不同情况，区别对待，合理分配；如果市、区主管业务机关需要提成，所占比例也不宜过大。
    在财务管理上，区、街不要统得过多过死。
    第六、街道民办工厂成员的工资，要贯彻按劳分配的原则，克服轻重倒置和平均主义的现象。目前，由于街道民办工业的劳动生产率一般还很低，工资水平应当低于地方国营工业。工资形式，可以根据企业的生产特点，采用计时、计时加奖励、计件或者分成工资等多种多样的形式；一些游街串巷的修理服务人员，也可以采取利润分成或者自负盈亏的办法。
    街道和企业应当在生产发展的基础上，根据先急需后一般和先集体后个人的原则，逐步举办一些集体福利
  （如食堂、托儿所等）。企业的福利待遇的标准，在不超过地方国营工业的原则下，企业之间可以允许有所不同，但差别不宜过大。
    第七、街道民办工业的资金来源，大部分是职工家属的集资，还有一部分手工业者和小商贩的资金，只有极少数资本家投入了一些生产资料。组织街道民办工业对动员和组织群众物力和财力发展生产有积极作用。目前，有些地区已经或正在陆续退还群众集资。在这方面，各地可以根据情况制定群众集资发展生产的办法，不必急于退还群众集资，以利于发展生产。
    第八、街道服务站的服务项目和方法，要灵活多样，以适应群众多种多样的需要。要不断提高服务质量，而不要单纯从利润上着眼。至于服务人员的工资、福利，一般也不要超过街道办的其他事业的水平。
    第九、对企业中的小资本家、小业主和他们的家属，要加强团结、教育、改造工作，发挥他们的专长，积极帮助他们在为社会主义建设服务中进行自我教育和自我改造。
    对地主、富农、反革命分子、坏分子、右派分子，要把他们置于群众的监督之下，通过生产劳动进行改造。现在还窃据企业领导职务的，应当调换，但不要把他们清洗出去。总之，在政治上和他们严格划清界限，经济实行上按劳付酬。
    第十、组织街道居民参加生产和服务性的劳动，是当前城市街道工作的一个主要内容。它是经济工作，又是政治工作。通过这一工作，可以推动街道其他各项工作的开展。因此，各方面的工作要配合协作，避免各行其是，顾此失彼。
    加强党对街道民办工业和服务事业的领导。在党的统一领导下，以街道办事处为主，结合市、区主管业务部门，实行双重领导。主管业务部门负责计划平衡和业务、技术指导；对具体生产、业务的管理和政治思想工作，由街道办事处负责。各主管业务部门的分工是：生产性的和修理性的，由手工业部门负责；服务事业，由商业部门负责。工商行政管理部门应当会同有关单位，加强对购、销活动和产品价格、质量的行政管理，取缔投机违法活动，贯彻对私改造政策，加强党和国家政策的宣传教育工作。
    城市街道民办工业和服务性事业，是新生的社会生产力量，作好这方面的组织领导工作，还需要有关领导方面，给予足够的重视。
