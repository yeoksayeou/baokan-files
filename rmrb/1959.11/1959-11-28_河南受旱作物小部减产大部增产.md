Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 27th: Thanks to the strong leadership of the Party, and relying on the mighty power of the People's Communes, the people of Henan Province have overcome a severe drought after nearly a hundred days of struggle, achieving a bumper autumn harvest. Of the province's nearly 100 million mu of autumn harvest crops—including grain, cotton, oilseeds, and flue-cured tobacco—affected by drought, only 15 million mu in high-altitude and hilly areas experienced varying degrees of yield reduction due to extreme water scarcity. The remainder saw increased production compared to last year.

This year, Henan Province suffered from a severe drought unprecedented in decades. Since June, the province has experienced very little rainfall. The average rainfall in July, August, and September was more than half less than the same period in normal years. The Huai River basin, in particular, experienced even less rainfall, with approximately 80% less than the same period in previous years. The severity, extent, and duration of the drought surpassed even the worst drought year in history, 1942. However, due to the difference in social systems, the situations following the two droughts are vastly different. In 1942, fifty counties across the province experienced drought, with 50 million mu of farmland affected. The drought-stricken areas were barren, and three million people lost their lives. This year, although more than ninety counties were affected, with nearly 100 million mu impacted, thanks to the leadership of the Communist Party and the powerful organization of the People's Communes, the broad masses of people were widely mobilized and organized, fully exploiting and utilizing various water sources for emergency irrigation. Thus, they overcame the severe drought and achieved a bumper harvest. According to statistics, of the province's drought-affected autumn crops, over 83 million mu were irrigated at least once, 60 to 70 million mu were irrigated two to three times, and some areas even irrigated four to five times. The total water usage reached 18 billion cubic meters, equivalent to five heavy rainfalls of 30 millimeters each, creating a situation where "the land is not dry despite the drought, and a good harvest is still achieved despite the disaster."

The People's Communes across the province demonstrated tremendous power in fighting the drought. Under the unified allocation of manpower and resources by the People's Communes, the province not only fully utilized existing water conservancy projects to rescue drought-stricken crops but also implemented large-scale operations. During the peak season of agricultural work, many new water conservancy projects were urgently repaired, and new water sources were developed. During the drought period, the province newly built and renovated 2,400 reservoirs, more than 600,000 large and small canals, expanding the irrigated area by 21 million mu. Xinyang Prefecture, the most severely drought-stricken area in the province, expanded the irrigated area by a total of 2.4 million mu through emergency repairs of water conservancy projects during the drought.

Under the leadership of Party organizations at all levels, People's Communes and production teams across the country fully promoted the spirit of communist cooperation, working together to overcome difficulties and conquer the drought demon. Eleven communes in Huaxian County, based on the principles of mutual assistance, mutual benefit, and equivalent exchange, mobilized 38,000 laborers, more than 5,600 head of livestock, and numerous water-lifting tools, excavated more than 2,100 water sources, and cooperatively irrigated more than 210,000 mu of land.

During the drought relief campaign, People's Communes in various localities also used public accumulation to purchase a large number of pumping machines to improve drought resistance capabilities. People's Communes across the province purchased more than 4,500 sets of power irrigation and drainage machinery. The fifteen newly built pumping stations in Lingbao County, Luoyang Prefecture, draw water from elevations of 40 to 50 meters or more. Many high-lying areas that could not be irrigated in previous years were irrigated this time. Communes along the Huai River, Shi River, Shi River, and Hong River in Xinyang Prefecture concentrated 156 irrigation and drainage machines to form a powerful mechanical irrigation network, ensuring the bumper harvest of crops on both banks.

The power of the People's Communes in the fight against drought has greatly increased the love of the broad masses of commune members for the communes. They enthusiastically sang: "We don't rely on the Dragon King, we don't rely on Heaven, the power of the commune is boundless. Even if it doesn't rain for a hundred days, we will still seize a bumper year!" Now, based on the great victory in the fight against drought, the broad masses of commune members across the province are preparing for continued agricultural production leaps next year with full confidence. A winter agricultural production campaign centered on water conservancy construction and wheat field management has already been launched vigorously across the province.

    河南受旱作物小部减产大部增产
    全省百日极少下雨，受旱面积近一亿亩，灾情超过了历史上旱灾最重的一九四二年。但是由于社会制度不同，情况完全两样。一九四二年受旱地区赤地千里，寸草不生；今年受旱作物只有一千多万亩减产，其余的都比去年增产。
    新华社郑州27日电　河南省广大人民在党的领导下，依靠人民公社的强大威力，经过将近百日的搏斗，战胜了严重旱灾，夺得秋季作物丰收。全省将近一亿亩受旱的粮食、棉花、油料和烤烟等秋收作物，除了高岗、丘陵等地区的一千五百万亩因水源极度缺乏而有程度不同的减产以外，其余的都比去年增产。
    今年河南省遭受了几十年未有的严重干旱。自6月份以来，全省就很少下雨，7、8、9三个月，全省平均降雨量比平常年份同期降雨量减少一半以上，特别是淮河两岸降雨量更少，比历年同期降雨量减少80％左右。全省旱情之重，面积之广，时间之长，都超过了历史上旱灾最重的1942年。但是，由于社会制度不同，两次灾荒后的情况迥然不一样。1942年，全省有五十个县发生干旱，受旱农田达五千万亩，受旱地区赤地千里，寸草不生，有三百万人在旱灾中丧失了生命。今年虽然受旱县份达到九十多个，受旱面积将近一亿亩，因为有了共产党的领导，有了人民公社这样一个具有强大生命力的组织，广泛地动员和组织了人民群众，充分挖掘和利用各种水源，抢浇抢灌，因而战胜了严重的干旱，赢得了丰收。据统计，全省受旱的秋收作物中，普浇一遍的有八千三百多万亩，浇了二遍到三遍的六、七千万亩，一部分还浇了四遍到五遍，用水总量达一百八十亿立方米，相当于降了五次三十毫米的大雨，使全省出现了“天旱地不旱，有灾仍丰收”的局面。
    全省人民公社在抗旱中显示出巨大的威力。在人民公社统一调剂人力、物力的情况下，全省不仅充分运用了原有的水利工程抢救受旱的庄稼，还实行大兵团作战，在农活大忙时期，抢修了许多新的水利工程，开辟新的水源。在干旱期间，全省新修和整修的水库有两千四百座，大小渠道六十多万条，扩大灌溉面积两千一百万亩。全省受旱最重的信阳专区，在抗旱中抢修的水利工程，共计扩大灌溉面积二百四十万亩。
    在各级党组织领导下，各地人民公社，社与社、队与队之间充分发扬了共产主义协作精神，同心协力拧成一股绳，克服困难，战胜旱魔。滑县十一个公社根据互助互利等价交换的原则，动员了三万八千个劳动力，五千六百多头牲口，以及许多提水工具，挖水源二千一百多处，协作浇地二十一万多亩。
    在抗旱运动中，各地人民公社还用公共积累添置了大量抽水机械提高抗旱能力。全省各人民公社共添置各种动力排灌机械达四千五百多部。洛阳专区灵宝县各公社新建的十五处抽水站，引水高程都在四、五十米以上，许多历年来浇不到水的高岗，这次都浇上水了。信阳专区沿淮河、溮河、史河、洪河两岸的公社，集中一百五十六台排灌机械，形成强大的提水机械灌溉网，保证了两岸农作物的丰收。
    人民公社在抗旱斗争中发挥的威力，使广大社员对公社倍加热爱，他们热情地歌颂道：“不靠龙王不靠天，公社威力大无边，任它百日不下雨，依然夺取丰收年！”现在全省广大社员正在抗旱斗争取得巨大胜利的基础上，满怀信心地为明年农业生产继续跃进作准备，以兴修水利和麦田管理为中心的冬季农业生产运动已经在全省蓬勃展开。（附图片）
