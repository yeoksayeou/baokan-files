What is Chemical Resin Tapping?

Chemical resin tapping is an effective scientific method of resin tapping. When newly opened resin tapping grooves are treated with chemical agents, the cells on the edge of the groove die or become paralyzed due to the stimulation of the agents. Therefore, the resin ducts will not be blocked by the expansion of surrounding cells in a relatively long period of time, which prolongs the resin outflow time and achieves the purpose of increasing resin production. This stimulation method of using chemical agents to increase resin production is collectively referred to as chemical stimulation resin tapping method, or chemical resin tapping for short.

Although chemical resin tapping is a new task in our country, many producing areas have experimented with and promoted it, and more than 20 kinds of agents have been used in various places. According to local experience, the use of sulfuric acid agents can generally increase production by three to five times; the use of caustic soda can increase production by about one time. However, both of these methods have an impact on the growth of pine trees and should only be carried out in conjunction with felling. Sulfuric acid should be limited to pine trees that will be felled within two years, and caustic soda should be limited to pine trees that will be felled within three to four years.

This year, some pine resin producing areas in the south have also adopted resin tapping methods using salt water, clean water, and urine. Practice has proved that using salt water for resin tapping can increase production by 50%-80%, and clean water can also increase production by about 30%. These two methods have no impact on the growth of trees and can be widely promoted.

    什么是化学采脂法
    化学采脂是一种有效的科学采脂方法。凡用化学药剂处理的新开的采脂割沟，由于沟边细胞受药剂的刺激而死亡或是瘫软，所以树脂沟在比较长的时间内不致因周边细胞膨胀而闭塞，而延长了松脂流出时间，达到增产松脂的目的。这种使用化学剂提高松脂产量的刺激法统称为化学刺激采脂法，简称化学采脂。
    化学采脂在我国虽是一件新的工作，但很多产区都试验和推广过，各地采用的药剂已超过二十多种。根据各地经验：一般使用硫酸药剂可提高产量三至五倍；使用烧碱，可增加产量一倍左右，但这两种方法对松树生长都有影响，只宜结合采伐进行。硫酸应限于在两年内要采伐的松树使用，烧碱限于三至四年内要砍伐的松树使用。
    今年南方一些松脂产区还采用了盐水、清水、尿水等采脂法。实践证明，用食盐水采脂可增产50％—80％，清水也可增产30％左右。这两种方法对树木生长都没有影响，可以普遍推广。
