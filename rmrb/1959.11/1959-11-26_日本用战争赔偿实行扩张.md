Japan Uses War Reparations to Expand

Chen Longshen

During World War II, Japanese imperialism committed heinous acts of aggression in Asia, bringing great suffering to the people of Asia. After the war, instead of faithfully fulfilling its reparations obligations to the affected countries as stipulated in the Potsdam Proclamation, the Japanese government, with the support of U.S. imperialism, has turned war reparations into a tool for Japanese monopoly capital to carry out economic expansion in Southeast Asia.

Reparations in Name, Expansion in Reality

Since September 1954, Japan has signed war reparations agreements with Burma, the Philippines, and Indonesia. In May of this year, it illegally signed a reparations agreement with South Vietnam. The payment periods are ten, twenty, twelve, and five years respectively, with the total amount of the four agreements reaching over one billion US dollars. In addition, the "economic cooperation" agreements arranged by the reparations institutions total over 700 million US dollars.

Recently, Nobusuke Kishi shamelessly described war reparations as "cooperation" for the sake of "prosperity" and "economic development" of Southeast Asian countries. However, the people of Southeast Asian countries have seen from their own experiences what this so-called "cooperation" has brought them. Even the late Philippine President Magsaysay once pointed out: "Although the Japanese use means of production to pay reparations, they will inevitably sell inferior goods at high prices." Even Takasaki Tatsunosuke, the chief representative of Japan's reparations negotiations with the Philippines, had to admit: "The price of machinery in Japan's reparations to the Philippines is more than double the estimated price at the time of negotiation." In reality, Japanese monopoly capital uses reparations to sell its inferior goods and make a fortune.

Japanese monopoly capital not only has its own calculations regarding who to compensate, how much to compensate, what to compensate with, and when to compensate, but also always uses various methods to coerce the other party into signing treaties of commerce and navigation with Japan, forcing them to guarantee most-favored-nation treatment. This was the case when signing agreements with the Philippines and Indonesia in the past, and it was also the case when signing agreements with South Vietnam this year. For example, when Japan signed a reparations agreement with Indonesia at the beginning of last year, the Japanese government repeatedly declared that it would "never abandon the policy of resolving the most-favored-nation treatment issue at the same time as reparations" because the Indonesian government refused to grant Japan most-favored-nation treatment, and threatened that "if Indonesia refuses to grant Japan most-favored-nation treatment, then the agreement on reparations reached by Kishi Nobusuke and Sukarno will be fundamentally overturned." The reason Japan demands most-favored-nation treatment through the reparations issue is to facilitate the entry of Japanese goods and capital into Southeast Asia by relying on its far stronger economic power than Southeast Asian countries.

The "economic cooperation" that Japan promised to provide to Southeast Asian countries when signing reparations agreements is actually a form of capital export. Since the Japanese government is not responsible for guaranteeing this "economic cooperation," Japanese monopoly capital is in a completely active position, able to choose favorable opportunities and export capital on favorable terms; and when the situation is unfavorable, it can choose not to export without being bound. The conditions proposed by Japan to Burma for jointly running a textile factory are that, in addition to taking dividends and bonuses as usual for imperialists, and requiring direct management of the enterprise and collecting 3%-4% of the sales amount as operating management fees every year; even more absurdly, the Japanese private investment amount is only 150 million to 200 million yen, but it requires the Burmese side to pay 34 million yen to the Japanese side every year as operating management fees during the three years from the start of construction to the full start of operation, regardless of how much is produced. This is the content of the "cooperation" that Kishi Nobusuke calls for the "prosperity" and "economic development" of Southeast Asian countries.

Monopoly Capital Enriches Its Own Pockets

It is not the Southeast Asian countries that benefit from the reparations, but Japanese monopoly capital. As of the end of June this year, Japan had paid out more than 166 million US dollars in reparations. Through the purchase of goods from Japanese monopoly enterprises, a large part of this compensation went into the pockets of Japanese monopoly capitalists.

According to materials revealed by the Japanese Diet in February this year, Kinoshita Shoten, a company known for its close ties between "politics and business," colluded with Nobusuke Kishi and others in reparations to Indonesia and the Philippines, and obtained huge profits. For example, Kinoshita Shoten monopolized nine of the first ten ships compensated to Indonesia, earning an intermediate profit of 600 to 700 million yen in a total transaction of only 2.15 billion yen. Kinoshita Shoten not only built a villa for Kishi Nobusuke, but also provided him with huge political funds. The average Japanese person bears 4,000 yen in reparations, which was pocketed by the greedy Kishi Nobusuke group and used as funds to maintain their reactionary rule.

Reparations have also expanded the commodity market of Japanese monopoly capital. In 1956, Japan's exports to Burma and the Philippines were more than 36 million US dollars and more than 55 million US dollars respectively. However, after the implementation of reparations, in 1957, Japan's exports to the two countries increased to 76 million US dollars and 89 million US dollars respectively, of which reparations accounted for 38.9% and 22.8% respectively. In 1958, they also accounted for 56.7% and 20.1% respectively.

Since Japanese heavy industrial products generally have high costs and poor technology, making it difficult to squeeze into the Southeast Asian market, and the industrial sectors that produce these products are the lifeline of Japanese monopoly capital, the Japanese reparations agreements with Southeast Asia stipulate not only that goods and services be used as compensation, but also that capital goods be used as compensation. In this way, many Japanese monopoly capital’s heavy industrial products with poor competitiveness and quality, such as transportation equipment and power generation equipment, can be sold at high prices in the Southeast Asian market.

In some industrial sectors in Japan that produce consumer goods, overproduction is particularly serious. In the case of particularly fierce competition in the Southeast Asian market, reparations have also become a means for Japanese monopoly capital to sell these stockpiled goods and crack down on competitors. Although the reparations agreement stipulates that capital goods should be used as compensation, consumer goods account for about 10% of actual compensation. Japan's first-year reparations plan for Indonesia also included 1.5 million US dollars each of cotton and rayon fabrics with difficult sales, and 2 million US dollars of chemical fertilizers.

The benefits that Japanese monopoly capital has obtained from reparations are far more than this. Japanese monopoly groups believe that: first, the settlement of the reparations issue and the signing of the "peace treaty" means that the relationship between Japan and Southeast Asian countries has completely returned to normal, and Japan will be able to obtain the same political status as Western European powers in Southeast Asia, thereby gaining an advantage in future economic activities; second, reparations can alleviate the hatred of the Southeast Asian people towards Japanese militarism to a certain extent, thereby reducing the resistance of Japan's economic expansion in Southeast Asia; third, reparations can be used as a bargaining chip to force the compensated countries to "open their doors" and, under the guise of "economic cooperation," cover the export of Japanese private capital.

The "Liaison Conference of Ambassadors to Reparations-Related Countries" convened by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs in March this year admitted that the ultimate goal of Japan's reparations to Southeast Asia is to "establish a long-term system of economic cooperation between Japan and Southeast Asia through reparations." Kishi Nobusuke more blatantly said in the instructions issued at the end of May regarding the formulation of a long-term economic plan, "The reparations issue has come to an end,... In order to establish the Japanese economy on a solid foundation, it is necessary to establish (our own) economic sphere." It can be seen that Japan's war reparations are actually an important step in the deployment of Japanese monopoly capital to rebuild the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere."

At present, due to the harsh conditions put forward by Japanese monopoly capital, and because Southeast Asian countries still have some concerns about Japanese imperialism, none of the "economic cooperation" with Southeast Asia stipulated in the Japanese reparations agreement has been realized. Therefore, Japan has changed its appearance and come up with a method of providing loans secured by reparations to realize its imperialist ambitions for economic expansion.

The US and Japan Collude

Japan's monopoly capital's expansion into Southeast Asia through reparations is not only supported by the United States, but also, in order to invade and enslave the people of Southeast Asia, the United States is constantly using Japan's war reparations to serve its own war policies.

Not long after the end of World War II, the United States tried its best to obstruct the implementation of Japanese reparations. However, after the signing of the one-sided San Francisco "Peace Treaty" with Japan, the United States turned to using Japanese reparations as a tool for Japanese and American monopoly capital to jointly expand into Southeast Asia. The first war reparations agreement signed by Japan in September 1954—the Japan-Burma reparations agreement—was signed under the planning of US imperialism. The Japanese "Economist" magazine at the time pointed out that this agreement was "a compromise product of the US policy towards Southeast Asia, Japan's measures to ensure markets, and the requirements of local countries to get rid of a single economy." As for the Japan-Philippines reparations agreement and other reparations agreements, they also serve the US "aid" policy. The reparations agreement signed between Japan and South Vietnam this year is a new step in the Japan-US military alliance. As the Japanese Socialist Party pointed out, it is "Japan's cooperation with the United States' Southeast Asia Treaty Organization." This collusion between Japanese and American monopoly capital makes Japan's monopoly capital's expansion into Southeast Asia even more dangerous.

At present, more and more people in Southeast Asia have seen through this expansionist conspiracy of Japanese monopoly capital. Philippine newspapers pointed out: "Any economic assistance and loan plans proposed by Japan bring nightmares of the old East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere to the Philippine people." Indonesian officials also believe: "In the past, the Japanese were just scratching at the door, but now they are knocking on the door, and tomorrow they will kick you down." There are now various signs that the conspiracy of Japanese monopoly capital to expand into Southeast Asia through reparations and assist the United States in preparing for war will be resolutely opposed by more and more Japanese and Southeast Asian people. The Southeast Asian people, who have embarked on the road of national independence, will never allow the conspiracy of Japanese monopoly capital to succeed.

    日本用战争赔偿实行扩张
    陈隆深
    第二次世界大战期间，日本帝国主义在亚洲犯下了滔天的侵略罪行，给亚洲人民带来了惨痛的灾难。战后日本政府不仅不按照波茨坦公告的规定，忠实地履行其对受灾国的赔偿义务，反而在美帝国主义支持下，将战争赔偿变成了日本垄断资本向东南亚实行经济扩张的工具。
    赔偿为名，扩张是实
    从1954年9月起日本已经同缅甸、菲律宾、印度尼西亚三国签订了战争赔偿协定，今年5月又非法地同南越签订了赔偿协定。支付期限分别为十年、二十年、十二年、五年，四个协定的赔偿额总计达十亿多美元。此外，日本趁赔偿机构搞的“经济合作”协定总额达七亿多美元。
    最近，岸信介恬不知耻地把战争赔偿说成是为了东南亚国家的“繁荣”和“经济发展”而进行的“合作”。但是，东南亚国家人民从切身的体验中，已经看出了这种所谓“合作”给他们带来了些什么。甚至菲律宾已故总统麦格赛赛也曾指出过：“虽然日本人用生产资料来支付赔偿，但必然是以高价出售劣货”。连日本对菲律宾赔偿谈判的首席代表高碕达之助也不得不承认：“日本对菲律宾赔偿的机械的价格，比谈判时的估价高出一倍以上”。实际上日本垄断资本就是这样利用赔偿来推销它们的劣货，想在赔偿中大捞一把。
    日本垄断资本不仅在赔给谁、赔多少、赔什么、何时赔等问题上都有自己的算盘，而且在签订赔偿协定时总是以种种方式要挟对方同日本签订通商航海条约，迫使对方保证给予最惠国待遇。过去同菲律宾和印度尼西亚签订协定时的情况如此，今年同南越签订协定时的情况也是如此。例如去年年初，日本同印度尼西亚签订赔偿协定时，由于印度尼西亚政府拒绝给日本以最惠国待遇，日本政府就一再宣称“绝不放弃与赔偿同时解决最惠国待遇问题的方针”，并威胁说：“如果印度尼西亚拒绝给日本以最惠国待遇，那么岸信介和苏加诺会谈取得一致的赔偿问题就要从根本上推翻”。日本所以借赔偿问题要求最惠国待遇，是为的便于凭借自己比东南亚国家远为强大的经济力量，为日本商品和资本长驱直入东南亚大开方便之门。
    日本在签订赔偿协定时答应给东南亚国家提供的“经济合作”，实际上就是一种资本输出。由于日本政府对这些“经济合作”不负保证之责，因此日本垄断资本就完全站在主动地位，既能挑选有利时机，按有利条件输出资本；在情况一旦不利时，又可以不输出而不受束缚。日本对缅甸提出的合办纺织厂的条件是，日本垄断资本除了按帝国主义的老例，拿什么股息和红利，并要求直接管理企业，每年按销售额攫取3％—4％的经营管理费之外；更荒唐的是，日方私人投资额仅为一亿五千万至二亿日元，而竟要求缅方从建厂到全部开工的三年间，不管生产多少，每年给日方经营管理费三千四百万日元。这就是岸信介所谓的为了东南亚国家的“繁荣”和“经济发展”而进行的“合作”内容。
    垄断资本自肥私囊
    从赔偿中得到实惠的不是东南亚国家，而是日本垄断资本。截至今年6月底，日本已付出一亿六千六百余万美元的赔偿。这笔赔偿通过对日本垄断企业商品的采购，很大部分落进了日本垄断资本家的腰包。
    从今年2月日本国会揭露出来的材料看，以“政商”著名的日本木下商店，在对印度尼西亚和菲律宾的赔偿中，同岸信介等人通同作弊，获得了巨额利润。例如，对印度尼西亚赔偿的第一批十艘船中，木下商店就独揽九只，在总共不过二十一亿五千万日元的交易中，获中间利润达六、七亿日元。木下商店不仅给岸信介盖了别墅，而且还给他提供了巨额的政治活动资金。日本人民平均每人负担达四千日元的赔偿款项，就这样被贪婪的岸信介集团饱了私囊，并用作他们维持反动统治的资金。
    赔偿还扩大了日本垄断资本的商品市场。1956年日本对缅甸和菲律宾的出口分别为三千六百多万美元和五千五百多万美元。但赔偿实施后，1957年日本对两国的出口就分别增至七千六百万美元和八千九百万美元，其中赔偿分别占38.9％和22.8％。1958年也分别占56.7％和20.1％。
    由于日本重工业产品一般成本高、技术差，不易挤进东南亚市场，而生产这些产品的工业部门又是日本垄断资本的命脉，因此在日本对东南亚的赔偿协定中，不仅规定以商品和劳务充当赔偿，而且还规定以资本货物充当赔偿。这样，日本垄断资本许多竞争能力较差而质量又次的重工业产品，如运输设备和发电设备等等，能够在东南亚市场以高价出售。
    在日本某些生产消费品的工业部门，生产过剩的情况特别严重。在东南亚市场竞争特别剧烈的情况下，赔偿也成为日本垄断资本推销这些积压商品和打击竞争对手的一种手段。尽管赔偿协定规定以资本货物充当赔偿，但在实际赔偿中消费品约占一成。日本对印度尼西亚的第一年度赔偿计划，也包括销路困难的棉布和人造丝织品各一百五十万美元，以及化学肥料二百万美元。
    日本垄断资本从赔偿中所得到的利益，绝不止于此。日本垄断集团认为：第一，赔偿问题的解决和“和平条约”的签订，就意味着日本和东南亚各国的关系完全恢复正常，日本就能够在东南亚取得与西欧列强同样的政治地位，从而在今后的经济活动中取得优势；第二，赔偿在一定程度上可以缓和东南亚人民对日本军国主义的仇恨情绪，从而减轻日本对东南亚经济扩张的阻力；第三，赔偿可以作为讨价还价的资本，迫使受赔偿国“开放门户”，并在“经济合作”的幌子下，掩护日本私人资本的输出。
    今年3月日本外务省召开的“赔偿有关国大使联络会议”，就承认日本对东南亚赔偿的最终目的，在于“通过赔偿长期确立日本与东南亚经济合作体制”。岸信介在5月底发出的有关制订长期经济计划的指示中，更明目张胆地说，“赔偿问题已告一段落，……为了使日本经济建立在稳固的基础上，有必要建立（自己的）经济圈”。可见，日本的战争赔偿实际上是日本垄断资本重建“大东亚共荣圈”部署中的重要步骤。
    目前由于日本垄断资本提出的条件苛刻，而东南亚各国对日本帝国主义还有所顾虑，日本在赔偿协定中规定的对东南亚的“经济合作”连一件也没有实现。于是日本就改头换面，想出一套以赔偿为担保提供贷款的办法，来实现其经济扩张的帝国主义野心。
        日美狼狈为奸
    日本垄断资本利用赔偿向东南亚的扩张，不仅得到美国的支持，而且为了侵略和奴役东南亚人民，美国不断利用日本的战争赔偿来为自己的战争政策服务。
    第二次世界大战结束不久，美国极力阻挠日本赔偿的实施。但是在旧金山片面对日“和约”签订后，美国转而要利用日本赔偿作为日美垄断资本共同向东南亚扩张的工具。1954年9月日本签订的第一个战争赔偿协定——日缅赔偿协定，就是在美帝国主义策划下签订的。当时的日本“经济学人”杂志就指出，这个协定是“美国对东南亚的政策和日本确保市场的对策以及要求摆脱单一经济的当地国家三者之间的妥协产物”。至于日菲赔偿协定和其他赔偿协定，也是为美“援”政策服务的。今年签订的日本和南越的赔偿协定，更是日美军事同盟的新步骤。正如日本社会党所指出的，它是“日本对美国的东南亚条约体制的合作”。日美垄断资本的这种狼狈为奸的关系，使得日本垄断资本向东南亚的扩张更加具有危险的性质。
    目前已有越来越多的东南亚人民识破日本垄断资本的这种扩张阴谋。菲律宾的报纸就指出：“日本所提出的任何经济援助和贷款计划，都给菲律宾人民带来旧东亚共荣圈的噩梦。”印度尼西亚的官员也认为：“从前日本人只是抓门，现今进一步敲门，明天他们会把你踢倒。”现在有种种迹象说明，日本垄断资本利用赔偿向东南亚扩张和协助美国准备战争的阴谋，必将遭到越来越多的日本人民和东南亚人民的坚决反对，已经走上民族独立道路的东南亚人民，绝不会允许日本垄断资本的阴谋得逞。
