    In the history of Chinese revolutionary literature, there is a consistent tradition, which is to strive for the popularization of revolutionary literature, to strive for revolutionary writers to integrate with the workers and peasants, and to strive for the emergence of worker-peasant writers. This is an arduous tradition, but also a glorious one.
    Since the "May Fourth" period, the pioneers of Marxism have loudly called for revolutionary intellectuals to "become one" with the workers and peasants; after the founding of the Chinese Communist Party, the Communists have constantly called on revolutionary writers to go among the workers and peasants and live a common life with them. After the failure of the Great Revolution, in the work of the "League of Left-Wing Writers" led by the Party, the popularization of literature (including the language and form of popular literature) and the worker-peasant correspondent movement always occupied the most important position. However, in those historical periods, the reactionary regime cruelly ruled China, the revolutionary workers and peasants lived in a situation of being exploited and persecuted, and revolutionary literature was also driven underground. In order to strive for the popularization of revolutionary literature and to implement the mass line in literary work, many pioneers of revolutionary literature lost their freedom and even sacrificed their precious lives!
    It was not until the literary symposium held in the revolutionary holy land of Yan'an in the later period of the Anti-Japanese War that Comrade Mao Zedong correctly and comprehensively solved the fundamental problem of the popularization of literature and art in theory – that revolutionary literature and art must serve the workers, peasants and soldiers, and how to serve the workers, peasants and soldiers. It also opened up a broad road for the realization of the popularization of literature and art, and promoted the large-scale emergence of mass literature and art in its infancy. However, this new situation could only be realized in the revolutionary base areas and liberated areas led by the Party; it was still impossible in the areas ruled by the Kuomintang reactionaries.
    The national liberation in 1949 enabled the revolutionary literary and art workers who were originally divided into two regions to have a grand meeting, and enabled all revolutionary literary and art workers to advance along the Party's literary and art line and along the road of serving the workers, peasants and soldiers. From this time on, the amateur creation of the workers and peasants had the possibility of large-scale production, and the new writers from the workers and peasants also had the conditions for appearing in batches. This possibility and this condition did not come easily, but were exchanged for by the blood of countless revolutionary martyrs and the lives of countless revolutionary masses! As a literary and art worker, how should we cherish the emergence of this condition! It is precisely this unprecedented condition that has prompted our past unrealizable ideal – the emergence of worker-peasant writers – to become a reality.
    I don't need to elaborate on how many ideological struggles we have gone through in literary and art since the founding of the country, and how we have shattered the slanders and attacks of enemies of various faces on the socialist literary and art line. These struggles have been experienced by everyone; and what we will never forget is that after various complex struggles, the Party's literary and art line has finally achieved a thorough victory, the mass line in literary and art work has finally been implemented in depth step by step, and the popularization of literature has finally been developed with each passing day. Comrade Zhou Yang said in "A Great Debate on the Literary and Art Front": "Our new literature and art is gradually penetrating into factories, rural areas, and troops. Now writers from workers and peasants and practical work cadres are constantly emerging... The amateur literary creation of the workers and peasants is becoming more and more numerous. Rural drama troupes have developed to hundreds of thousands, and tens of thousands of plays have been created by farmers as amateurs. The rightists certainly look down on the creation of the masses, but we see the future of our country's literary and artistic cause from this unprecedented scale of popularization." How worthy of our cheers and cherishing is the emergence of all these undeniable facts! And what is especially encouraging is that after the anti-rightist struggle, following the great leap forward in production in 1958, there was a great leap forward in literary and art work, and countless mass amateur creations from the workers, peasants, and practical work cadres appeared before us. This is worth writing a special chapter in our revolutionary literary history.
    In this short article, I cannot list some specific statistics or titles of excellent works - this detailed work remains to be done by the "Writers Association" and other literary and art institutions in the future; but as the editor of a literary magazine, I really have endless personal experiences and feelings to tell! Editing literary journals is not a new thing for me. In various periods before liberation, I was responsible for the editing of literary publications. But since 1958, I have deeply felt that we are facing a new situation in which the creation of workers and peasants is unprecedentedly prosperous and a large number of new amateur authors from workers and peasants and cadres are emerging. In the past year, in "Wenyi Yuebao" (now renamed "Shanghai Literature"), which I participated in, we compiled several special collections of folk songs and feature stories created by amateur workers and peasants, a special issue of Shanghai workers' creations, and more than 20 works (memoirs, features, essays, novels, etc.) by cadres in factories and government agencies. Two months ago, we calculated the accounts: since the beginning of last year, there have been 108 new authors from the workers, peasants, and practical work cadres who have maintained regular contact with us (not including mass amateur authors and worker writers who had already started writing before last year, and mass amateur authors who occasionally submit one or two manuscripts). The two publications of the Shanghai Writers Association Branch have contacted more than 300 mass amateur new authors in total. These facts encourage us to write such words in the work summary: "The central link of editing work is to contact writers and organize mass amateur authors. Under the principle of attaching equal importance to both, the focus of work should be on mass amateur creation. This aspect of work is the foundation of the publication." This is indeed a new thing and a new situation for me!
    In the past, we could only rely on professional writers to edit literary publications, because the experience at that time really told us that literary publications could only be edited in this way. However, after liberation, after the anti-rightist struggle and the Great Leap Forward, we are faced with such a new reality and a new situation! How worthy of our cheers for its emergence! And how worthy of comfort for those revolutionary literary workers who have made arduous efforts to strive for its realization in the past!
    However, what is surprising is that even today, there are still people who "happily" pour cold water on mass creation! He wields the magic weapon of "creation requires talent" to scare amateur authors from the workers and peasants. On the one hand, he has to admit that they should "cultivate talent from enthusiastic and hard labor training and learning," but on the other hand, he describes the persistent efforts of the masses to create as "just blindly working hard" and "will not get any good results" (see Wu Yan's "Creation Requires Talent" in "Xin Gang" August issue). I don't want to copy here the frivolous and venomous words that this author said about the vigorous mass creation since last year. I just want to remind everyone to pay attention: there are still people around us who openly enjoy pouring cold water on mass creation. Of course, as he himself expected, the cold water he poured cannot "defeat" the "real genius" from the masses; in fact, for the mighty momentum of the workers and peasants creation driven by the situation of the Great Leap Forward in production, his "cold water" is only like throwing a withered leaf on a vast river, and cannot have any impact; but those who have the same or similar opinions as Wu Yan are probably not just one or two people, so this tendency is still worth our attention!
    According to my understanding, so-called "talent" is nothing more than the ability cultivated from enthusiastic drive and diligent efforts. Gorky once said: "Talent grows out of enthusiasm for work. Extremely speaking, it can even be said that 'talent' is essentially just a 'love' for work and for the work process." (See "To Young Authors" page 47) Please see, how warm and encouraging an attitude the mentor of proletarian revolutionary literature takes towards young amateur writers. But Wu Yan's article has no intention of encouraging amateur writers at all; on the contrary, it sends out a series of cold ridicule and abuse, such as "bragging", "naive", "joke", etc., doing everything possible to satirize. In a word, in his opinion, literary creation can only be monopolized by a very small number of people with special and innate "talent", and the broad masses have no share in it. This view has nothing in common with the Party's literary and art ideology and literary and art policy. The Party's policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend, improving on the basis of popularization, popularizing under the guidance of improvement, and the principle of combining professional and amateur are all effective policies that have been implemented in literary and art work for many years to implement the mass line. In all its work, our Party advocates that we must mobilize the masses and give play to the creativity of the masses. The proletarian literature and art is different from all the literature and art of the past. It is not created by a few people who are divorced from the masses in a cold and desolate manner. Like Wu Yan, seeing the partial shortcomings that have been corrected, standing aside and rudely criticizing, and even negating them, is the attitude of the bourgeois aristocratic masters. That kind of view is also the bourgeois literary view. Wu Yan, under the guise of seemingly guiding young people, reveals the face of a thoroughgoing promoter. A true revolutionary should enthusiastically treat mass movements, support them, and guide them. Seeing a little shortcoming in the revolutionary mass movement, he rejoices as if he had found a treasure, talks about it with relish, viciously attacks it, and asks the masses to stop moving forward. That is by no means the attitude of a revolutionary.
    Marxists believe that literary and art work, like other revolutionary work, must have a broad mass base. Today, our prosperous creative scene is concrete proof. Here, I would like to give an example that I know better: Comrade Hu Wanchun, a worker author in Shanghai, is now a relatively familiar writer, and no one can deny that he has creative talent. However, when Shanghai was liberated, he was just a young steelworker who liked to fight. Not only could he not write, but he was also semi-literate. As he himself said, "Before 1952, I had no culture," and I didn't even understand what "exploitation" meant (see "Soil and Seeds"). At that time, who could see that he had creative talent? His only characteristic was to earnestly accept the Party's education and training, work hard to learn, and work hard to write (see the foreword to "Who is the Creator of Miracles"). Finally, after 1952, he showed his talent in literary creation. He wrote some works that were popular with readers and was considered a promising young worker writer.
    Comrade Mao Zedong once said when talking about guiding the peasant masses: "Let them do it, and they will learn lessons and increase their talents in the process of doing it. In this way, a large number of outstanding people will emerge" (see "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation"). I think this principle is also completely applicable to the mass literary and art creation movement. In the wave of amateur creation by workers and peasants since 1958, we have clearly seen that our literary and art work has made great progress, and we have seen the glorious future of our country's literary and art cause. Only seeing the shortcomings (of course, shortcomings must be corrected), but not seeing the major gains of the mass creation movement since last year, such people are either spiritually blind or have ulterior motives.
    Of course, mass amateur authors need the enthusiastic help of professional literary and art workers, promptly point out their shortcomings, and promote them to move forward faster. It can be said that many amateur authors are eagerly looking forward to this kind of help, even some severe criticisms, they are very welcome, but enthusiastic help, severe criticisms, these are two different things from Wu Yan's bad attitude of "happily" "pouring cold water", these cannot be confused. We must fight back against Wu Yan's bourgeois literary and art ideology.

    才能、群众创作、泼冷水
    以群
    中国革命文学的历史当中，有一个始终一贯的传统，那就是争取革命文学的群众化，争取革命作家和工农群众打成一片，争取工农作家的产生。这是一个艰苦卓绝的传统，也是一个光辉灿烂的传统。
    从“五四”时期起，马克思主义的先驱者就大声疾呼地要求革命的知识分子和工农群众“打成一气”；中国共产党成立之后，共产党人又不断地号召革命文学家到工农群众当中去，和工农群众过共同的生活。大革命失败之后，在党所领导的“左翼作家联盟”的工作中，文学大众化（包括大众文学的语言、形式问题）和工农通讯员运动始终占着最主要的地位。但是，在那些历史时期中，反动的政权残酷地统治着中国，革命的工农群众生活在被榨取、被迫害的境遇之中，革命的文学也被打入了地下，为了争取革命文学的群众化，争取在文学事业中贯彻群众路线，不少革命文学的先驱者失去了自由，甚至献出了他们宝贵的生命！
    直到抗日战争后期，在革命圣地延安所举行的文艺座谈会上，才由毛泽东同志从理论上正确而全面地解决了文艺群众化的根本问题——革命的文艺必须为工农兵群众服务以及如何为工农兵群众服务的问题，并且为实现文艺的群众化开拓了一条宽阔的道路，推动了萌芽状态的群众文艺的大量出现。只是这种新局面还只能在党所领导的革命根据地、解放区实现；在国民党反动派统治的地区里仍然是不可能的。
    1949年的全国解放，使原来被分割在两个地区的革命文艺工作者得到了大会师，使所有的革命文艺家都有可能沿着党的文艺路线，沿着文艺为工农兵群众服务的大道前进。从这时起，工农群众的业余创作才有了大量产生的可能，而工农出身的新作家也才有了成批出现的条件。这种可能、这个条件并非轻易得来，而是无数革命先烈的血，无数革命群众的生命换来的！作为一个文艺工作者，应该如何珍视这种条件的出现啊！正是这种前所未有的条件，促使我们过去不能实现的理想——工农作家的产生——变成了现实。
    我无需细述建国以来我们经过了多少次的文艺思想斗争，以及我们怎样击破了各种面貌的敌人对社会主义文艺路线的诬蔑和攻击，这些斗争都是大家共同经历过来的；而使我们永志不忘的，是经过种种复杂的斗争之后，党的文艺路线终究得到了彻底的胜利，文艺工作中的群众路线终究得到了步步深入的贯彻，文学群众化终究得到了日新月异的开展。周扬同志曾在“文艺战线上的一场大辩论”中说：“我们的新文艺正在逐步深入到工厂、农村和部队。现在工农出身和实际工作干部出身的作家正在不断地涌现。……工农群众的业余文学创作越来越多了。农村剧团已经发展到几十万个，农民业余创作的剧本数以万计。右派分子当然看不起群众的创作，但是我们却从这个空前的普及规模上看到了我国文艺事业的未来。”这一切无可歪曲的事实的产生多么值得我们欢呼和珍惜啊！而尤其值得我们鼓舞的，是经过反右派斗争之后，跟着1958年的生产大跃进而出现了文艺工作的大跃进，无可计数的从工农群众和实际工作干部中来的群众业余创作出现在我们面前。这是值得在我们的革命文学史上大书特书的。
    在这短文里，我不能列举出一些具体的统计数字或优秀作品的篇目——这个细致的工作还有待于今后“作家协会”及其他文艺机构来做；但作为一个文学杂志的编者，实在也有说不完的亲身经历的感受！编辑文学期刊，对我来说并不是一件新鲜事，解放以前的各个时期，都曾负担过文学刊物的编务。但在1958年以来，却使我深切地感到：我们已经面对着一个工农群众创作空前繁荣、工农出身和干部出身的业余新作者大量涌现的新局面。在过去一年的我所参与的“文艺月报”（现已改名“上海文学”）上，我们编成了几个工农群众业余创作的民歌特辑和特写专辑，一期上海工人创作专号，二十余篇工厂、机关干部的作品（回忆录、特写、散文、小说等）。两个月前，我们算了笔账：从去年开始出现，至今还和我们保持着经常联系的从工农群众和实际工作干部中涌现出来的新作者达一百零八人（去年以前已经开始创作的群众业余作者和工人作家，以及偶然投一、二篇稿的群众业余作者都不算在内）。上海作协分会两个刊物所联系的群众业余新作者合起来已达三百余人。这些事实鼓舞我们在工作小结中写上了这样的词句：“编辑工作的中心环节是联系作家与组织群众业余作者。在两者并重的原则下，将工作重点放在群众业余创作方面。这方面的工作是刊物的基础”。这对我来说，确是新的事情、新的形势！
    过去，我们编文学刊物只能依靠专业作家，因为那时的经验确实告诉我们：文学刊物只能这样编。可是，在解放后，在经过了反右派斗争和大跃进之后，却使我们面对着这样的新现实和新形势！这是多么地值得我们欢呼它的出现啊！而对于那些在过去曾经为争取它的实现而付出了艰苦努力的革命文学工作者，又是多么地值得欣慰啊！
    可是，令人惊异的是直到今天，还有“欣然”对群众创作泼冷水的人！他祭起“创作需要才能”的法宝，来吓唬从工农群众中来的业余作者，他一面不得不承认他们应“从热情地艰苦地劳动锻炼和学习中培养才能”，另一方面又把群众坚韧不辍地努力创作说成是“一味蛮干下去”“是得不到什么好效果的”（见“新港”八月号、吴雁作“创作需要才能”）。我不愿在这里抄引这位作者对去年以来的蓬勃的群众创作所说的那些轻薄、刻毒的词句，我只想提起大家注意：在我们周围还有公然以对群众创作泼冷水自乐的人。自然，像他自己所料，他所泼的冷水并不能“打倒”从群众中来的“真正的天才”；事实上，对于被生产大跃进的形势所带动的工农群众创作的磅礴气势，他的“冷水”只如在浩大的江河上投下一片枯叶，并不能发生任何的影响；但怀有与吴雁相同或相似的意见的，恐还不只一、二人，因此，对这种倾向还是很值得我们注意！
    据我的了解：所谓“才能”无非是从热诚的干劲和勤苦的努力中培养出来的能力。高尔基曾说：“才能是从对于工作的热情中成长起来的，极端地说来，甚至可以说：所谓‘才能’，本质上不过是对于工作，对于工作过程的一种‘爱’而已。”（见“给青年作者”四七页）请看，无产阶级革命文学的导师对青年业余写作者采取了多么热情的关怀和鼓励的态度。可是吴雁的文章对业余写作者却丝毫也没有鼓励之意；相反地，倒是发出了一连串的冷嘲恶骂，什么“吹牛”“幼稚”“笑话”等等，极尽挖苦之能事。一句话，在他看来，文艺创作只能由极少数有特殊的、具有天赋的“才能”的人来包办，广大群众是没有份的。这种观点同党的文艺思想、文艺政策是没有任何共同之点的。党的百花齐放、百家争鸣方针，在普及的基础上提高，在提高的指导下普及，以及专业和业余相结合等原则，都是在文艺工作中贯彻群众路线若干年来行之有效的方针。我们党在各项工作中，都主张必须发动群众，发挥群众的创造力。无产阶级的文艺是不同于过去一切的文艺的，它不是少数人脱离了群众，冷冷清清地创造出来的。像吴雁那样，看到了已经纠正了的局部的缺点，站在旁边粗暴地加以指责，甚至否定，那是资产阶级贵族老爷式的态度。那种观点也是资产阶级的文艺观点。吴雁在貌似指导青年的外衣下，暴露出了十足的促退派的面目。一个真正的革命家应该热情地对待群众运动，加以支持，加以指导。看到了革命的群众运动中的一点儿缺点，就如获至宝，津津乐道，恶毒地进行攻击，要求群众停止前进，那就决不是一个革命家的态度。
    马克思主义者认为文艺工作同其他革命工作一样也必须有广大的群众基础。今天，我们创作上的繁荣景象正是具体的证明。这里，我想举一个自己比较了解的例子：上海的工人作者胡万春同志，现在已是大家比较熟悉的作家，无人能够否认他有创作才能。但是，当上海解放之初，他只是一个好打架的青年炼钢工人，不仅不能写作，而且还是半文盲。如他自己所说：“在1952年以前，我还没有文化”，连什么叫“剥削”也不明白（见“土壤和种子”）。在那个时候，谁又能看出他有创作才能呢？他的唯一特点就是认真地接受党的教育和培养，努力学，努力写（见“谁是奇迹的创造者”前记）。终于在1952年以后，在文学创作上显示了他的才能，他写出了一些受读者欢迎的作品，被认为是一位有前途的青年工人作家。
    毛泽东同志在谈到指导农民群众的问题时曾说：“要让他们做，在做的中间得到教训，增长才干。这样，大批的优秀人物就会产生”（见“关于农业合作化问题”）。我以为这个道理对于群众文艺创作运动，也是完全适用的。在1958年以来的工农群众业余创作的热潮中，使我们清楚地看到了我们的文艺工作有了很大的发展，看到了我国文艺事业的光辉未来。只看到缺点（有缺点当然要改正），而看不到去年以来的群众创作运动的重大收获，这样的人不是精神上的瞎子，就是别有用心。
    群众业余作者当然需要专业文艺家的热诚的帮助，及时地指出他们的缺点，推动他们更快地前进，可以说，许多业余作者都眼巴巴地期待着这种帮助，那怕是一些严厉的批评，他们也是十分欢迎的，但是，热诚的帮助，严厉的批评，这都和吴雁的这种“欣然”“泼冷水”的恶劣态度是两回事，这是不能混同的。对于吴雁的这类资产阶级文艺思想，我们必须给以反击。
