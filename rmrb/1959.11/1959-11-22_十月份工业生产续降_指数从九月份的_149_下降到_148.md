    Industrial Production Continued to Decline in October
    Index Drops from 149 in September to 148
    (Reported by this newspaper) The U.S. government announced on the 15th that U.S. industrial production continued to decline in October. The industrial production index for October was 148 (with 1947-1949 as 100), a slight decrease from the September index and a decrease of seven points from the June index this year.
    U.S. industrial production has been declining since July. This is related to the nearly four-month-long strike by 500,000 steelworkers. During the strike, 310 steel mills and 118 iron ore mines across the United States were shut down. This not only greatly reduced the market supply of steel, but also reduced users' steel reserves to less than 10 million tons (less than two months of U.S. consumption). This resulted in substantial production cuts in the automotive, construction, and other steel-using industries.
    The automotive manufacturing industry, the largest steel user, produced 143,000 fewer vehicles in October than originally planned due to the lack of steel. General Motors, the largest U.S. automaker, completely halted production at the end of October.
    The construction industry has also been hit hard. According to "Engineering News-Record," heavy construction contracts in October have fallen to their lowest point since 1954. Most household appliance manufacturers have also announced production cuts due to the temporary inability to restore steel supplies.
    Due to production cuts, the number of unemployed workers in the United States increased again in October, from 3,230,000 in September to 3,272,000.
    Currently, although 500,000 steelworkers have been ordered to return to work, industrial production cuts and unemployment remain severe due to the temporary inability to restore U.S. steel supplies. According to the British "Financial Times" on November 14, U.S. automakers expect to produce 100,000 fewer vehicles than normal in November due to the continued shortage of steel. On November 13, Chrysler, the third-largest U.S. automaker, closed one of its Detroit assembly plants due to steel shortages, laying off 1,100 workers. Ford Motor Company laid off 3,500 workers at its Cleveland engine manufacturing plant. Recently, the number of unemployed auto workers alone has reached 224,940.

### 十月份工业生产续降  指数从九月份的149下降到148

    十月份工业生产续降
    指数从九月份的149下降到148
    本报讯　美国政府15日宣布，美国工业生产在10月份继续下降。10月份工业生产指数是148（以1947—1949年为100），比9月份的指数下降了一点，比今年6月份的指数下降了七点。
    美国工业生产从7月份以来一直在下降。这同五十万钢铁工人近四个月的大罢工有关。在罢工期中，美国全国三百一十个钢厂、一百一十八个开采铁矿的坑井关闭了。这不仅大大减低市场钢铁供应，而且还使用户手中贮存的钢材下降到不及一千万吨（不到美国两个月消费量）。这就造成了汽车、建筑和其他使用钢铁的企业的大量减产。
    最大的钢铁用户汽车制造业在10月份由于缺乏钢铁，比原计划少生产了十四万三千辆。美国最大的通用汽车公司在10月底已完全停止了生产。
    建筑业也同样遭到沉重打击。根据美国“工程新闻报道”的消息，重型建筑合同在10月份已减少到1954年以来的最低点。大多数家用器具制造商也由于钢铁供应一时不能恢复而宣告减产。
    由于生产减缩，10月份美国的失业工人又在增加，从9月份的三百二十三万人增加到三百二十七万二千人。
    目前，尽管五十万钢铁工人已奉命复工，但是由于美国钢铁供应一时还不能恢复，工业减产和失业情况仍很严重。据英国“金融时报”11月14日消息，美国汽车制造商在钢铁仍然缺乏下，11月份预计仍将比正常产量减少十万辆。11月13日，美国第三家大汽车公司克莱斯勒公司由于缺钢而把它在底特律的一个汽车装配厂关闭，遣散了一千一百人。福特汽车公司则把它在克里夫兰的制造汽车引擎的工人解雇了三千五百人。最近，仅失业汽车工人已达到二十二万四千九百四十人。
