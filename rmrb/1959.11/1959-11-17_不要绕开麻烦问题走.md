    Don't Avoid Troublesome Problems
    Wei Shun
    Some people use the phrase "bright future" to describe community-run schools, and this is very appropriate. The Zhongjiazhuang Community-Run Primary School in Taozhuang Commune, Xinghua County, Jiangsu Province, is a vivid example. Four years ago, this school had only a dilapidated temple and twenty-six students; now it is a fully-fledged primary school with two hundred students; and the quality of education is no less than that of public primary schools. This is a tremendous change, and every reader can see the bright future of community-run schools through this school.
    Any new thing always grows from small to large, from weak to strong, from low-level to high-level, and from incomplete to complete. This is the law of development. The development and growth of community-run schools is also like this. Now, we are happy to see that not just one school, but millions of schools are gradually consolidating and growing after overcoming some temporary difficulties on the road ahead. Community-run schools have become a powerful force in China's education system.
    Actively leading and supporting the masses in running schools, and not circumventing "troubles" and "difficulties," is a very valuable experience of the Zhongjiazhuang Community-Run Primary School. Not only will community-run schools encounter "troubles" at the beginning, but they will also encounter this or that kind of "trouble" after the school is established. For example, some people have the idea of "greed for the new and pursuit of the foreign" in school construction; some teachers do not have a sufficient understanding of the importance of community-run schools, and their professional ideology is not consolidated; what to do about the shortage of new teachers when the school expands, and so on. All these "troubles" have been resolved one by one by the Zhongjiazhuang Community-Run Primary School under the leadership of the Party branch, and as a result, the school is getting better and better. How to treat these "troubles" of community-run schools is essentially a question of attitude towards the revolutionary mass movement and towards the state and the masses running schools. The masses want their children to have access to education and urgently demand that schools be run. When difficulties and problems are encountered after the school is established, if they are not actively led and resolved, but instead people sigh, complain about difficulties, wouldn't this discourage the masses, and wouldn't it affect the consolidation of community-run schools and the rapid, good, and economical development of China's education?
    In a country as vast and populous as ours, it is unimaginable to achieve universal primary education in a relatively short period of time without adopting a school-running method that combines the central and local governments, and the government and the masses. Take Jiangsu as an example. Last year, the province added 1.6 million primary school students in one month, of which 1.2 million were students in community-run primary schools. This year, community-run schools account for 60% of the newly enrolled students. This fact fully demonstrates the important role of community-run schools in China's general education. We must adhere to the policy of running schools by both the state and the masses, and push China's education to a new climax.

    不要绕开麻烦问题走
    韦顺
    有人以“前途似锦”这几个字来形容民办学校，这是再恰当也不过了。江苏省兴化县陶庄公社仲家庄民办小学就是一个很生动的例子。这所学校在四年以前，只有一个破庙，二十六个学生；现在已是初具规模、拥有二百名学生的完全小学了；教育质量也不亚于公立小学。这是一个巨大的变化，每个读者都可透过这所学校看到民办学校美好的前景。
    任何一个新生的事物，它总是由小到大，由弱到强，由低级到高级，由不完备到完备的。这是事物的发展规律。民办学校发展成长的过程也是这样。现在，我们高兴的看到，不仅是一所学校，而是千百万所学校都在克服前进道路上的某些暂时困难之后，逐步巩固壮大起来。民办学校已成为我国教育事业中一支强大的力量。
    积极领导、支持群众办学，不要绕开“麻烦”、“困难”的问题走，这是仲家庄民办学校一条很宝贵的经验。不仅民办学校办学之初会遇到“麻烦”问题，就是办起学校之后，也会遇到这样或那样的“麻烦”问题。例如，在学校建设问题上，有些人有“贪新图洋”的思想；有的教师对于民办学校的重要性认识不足，专业思想不巩固；学校扩大了，新的师资缺额怎么办，等等。所有这些“麻烦”问题，仲家庄民办小学，在党支部领导下都一个一个的解决了，因而学校越办越好。如何对待民办学校的这些“麻烦”问题，实质上是对待革命的群众运动，对待国家和群众办学的态度问题。群众要让自己的子女有书读，迫切要求办学。学校办起来了，遇到困难和问题，如果不积极领导和解决，而是唉声叹气，叫喊困难，这岂不是泄群众的气，岂不会影响到民办学校巩固，影响到我国教育事业多快好省的发展吗？
    像我们这样一个幅员广大、人口众多的国家，若不采取中央和地方，政府和群众结合的办学办法，要想在较短的时间普及小学教育，是难以想像的。以江苏为例，去年一个月内全省增加小学学生一百六十万，其中一百二十万是民办小学的学生。今年新招收的学生，民办学校学生又占60％。这个事实充分说明了民办学校在我国普通教育事业中的重大作用。我们必须坚持国家办学和群众办学并举的方针，把我国教育事业推向更高潮。
