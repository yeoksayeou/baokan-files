Fleshy Friendship
——Remembering the Story of Soviet Young Women Donating Skin Grafts to Chinese Children
Yuan Weizhi

One day in October this year, in the city of Hailanpao in the Amur region of the Soviet Far East, two Soviet girls affectionately kissed a Chinese boy. This was a meeting arranged at the invitation of the Beijing Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio. This re-enacted scene encompasses the unspeakable, flesh-and-blood friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples. On this Chinese boy named Meng Xianguo, grows the skin of Soviet girls Filatova and Dorozhkina.

The story begins in March of last year. Little Xianguo, only three years old and just learning to walk, lived in Zhengqi Village, Huma County, Heilongjiang Province. One evening, his mother, Zhang Jiying, went to the Heilong River to fetch water. While Xianguo was playing, he fell onto the stove, his scarf caught fire, and then his clothes also caught fire. By the time his mother rushed back to rescue him, the child was unconscious and half of his face, hand, and part of his chest were burned. Zhang Jiying cried, holding her dying child. Village cadres, hearing the news, urgently discussed how to save the child. It would take two days and two nights to walk from Zhengqi Village to the county seat. Just as everyone was at their wit's end, someone suddenly said, "Let's contact our Soviet elder brothers on the other side." The village cadres thought it was a good idea and immediately ran to the riverbank to signal. As a result of the contact, the Soviet friends on the other side requested that the child be sent over for treatment immediately. Thus, Zhang Jiying, carrying her severely burned child, arrived in the Soviet village of Kuz'zovo that evening.

In Kuz'zovo Village, doctor Rudzi and the nurses immediately disinfected the child and gave him an emergency injection. The farm's Party committee secretary and chairman were anxiously waiting for news at the hospital. When the doctor finished examining Meng Xianguo's injuries, the secretary and chairman anxiously asked, "How is it? Can he be saved?"

"The situation is very dangerous. We need to contact Chernyevo Village Hospital and transfer him there."

Upon hearing this, the farm chairman immediately picked up the phone. Rogena, the director of Chernyevo Village Hospital, received the call and immediately dispatched a nurse and an ambulance, while also preparing for surgery. That night, countless Soviet people stayed awake to save a Chinese child, and countless Soviet people cared about the life of this Chinese child. The next day, when the sun rose, Meng Xianguo's rescue surgery was completed.

All the medical staff at Chernyevo Village Hospital took turns caring for this Chinese child. Originally, two or three people would have been enough, but no one wanted to give up the opportunity to look after the Chinese child. More than forty days passed, and the child's condition improved day by day. Zhang Jiying, who could not speak Russian, could only express her gratitude with tears and various gestures. The Soviet friends comforted Zhang Jiying with warm smiles and their favorite simple Chinese phrases: "Sino-Soviet friendship," "You're welcome."

Most of the child's injuries had healed. Only two burns on his arm did not close, and unsightly scars remained on the healed areas. Zhang Jiying originally thought that the remaining parts could be treated back in China. But the Soviet doctors firmly disagreed. They said: Our responsibility is to heal the child completely. China is our great friend, and we must be responsible for the child to the end.

To heal the child completely and prevent unsightly scars on his face, the only way was to give the child a skin graft. For the skin graft, Zhang Jiying and her son were transferred to Tigda District Hospital. Filatova and Dorozhkina, students of the Leichkinsk Medical School and members of the Communist Youth League, who were interning at the hospital, won the opportunity to care for the Chinese child in the hospital-wide debate over who should care for him. Skin grafts could have been done using the mother's skin, but the Soviet friends believed that the mother needed to take care of the child. Surgeon and Communist Party member Gamarov decided to use Soviet skin to graft onto the child.

For the sake of the Chinese brother's child, everyone in the hospital asked to use their own skin for the skin graft, and another argument began. In the end, Filatova and Dorozhkina won this "right" again. They insisted, "We are healthy, and we are the ones taking care of the child, we should have priority." Fearing that Zhang Jiying would not bear to cut the skin of the Soviet people, the first skin graft was performed without her knowledge. When it was Dorozhkina's turn for the second skin graft, Zhang Jiying insisted on using her own, she couldn't bear to cut the skin of Soviet friends again. "They are both girls, not yet married, it will be ugly if they get their skin cut, let's use mine." Zhang Jiying pleaded with the doctor. But Dorozhkina refused to yield. "Since Filatova was allowed, I should be allowed too." When Dorozhkina walked into the operating room with a satisfied expression, Zhang Jiying quietly stood at the door. After the surgery, Zhang Jiying's front was soaked with tears of gratitude.

In two skin grafts, the Soviet girls donated six hundred square millimeters of skin to the Chinese child. When Zhang Jiying expressed her gratitude to Filatova and Dorozhkina, the two girls smiled and said, "We have done our part in saving the life of a Chinese child, this is our greatest glory and happiness."

After final treatment at the Irkutsk City Children's Hospital, Meng Xianguo was completely healed in early May of this year. The mother and son received the warmest care in the Soviet land for more than a year, learned Russian, and returned to their hometown healthy and happy.

Among the tens of thousands of stories of Sino-Soviet friendship, this is an interlude without bizarre plots. But the anxiety of the Party committee secretary and chairman of Kuz'zovo Village Farm, Rogena's sleepless night, the flowers in the Irkutsk City Children's Hospital, the scars on Filatova and Dorozhkina's bodies, and the skin on Meng Xianguo's body, constitute a beautiful flower of friendship. It will not be forgotten by all the Chinese people, all the people of the world, and it also lets the reactionaries of the world know that the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people is a flesh-and-blood friendship, a friendship that no one and no method can break.

    血肉的友谊
    ——记苏联女青年给中国孩子植皮的故事
    苑维志
    今年10月间的一天，在苏联远东阿穆尔州海兰泡市，两个苏联姑娘抱着一个中国男孩亲切地吻着。这是应北京中央新闻纪录电影制片厂邀请的一次会面。这个历史再现的镜头，包括说不尽的中苏人民血肉相联的友谊，在这个叫孟宪国的中国男孩身上，长着苏联姑娘菲拉托娃和多洛日基娜的皮肤。
    故事的开头在去年的3月。居住在黑龙江省呼玛县正旗村的小宪国只有三岁，刚刚会走。一天傍晚，妈妈张纪英到黑龙江边去挑水，宪国正玩的时候跌倒在炉子上，围巾被火点着，接着衣服也起了火。等妈妈赶回来抢救的时候，孩子已经不知人事，半个脸、手和胸部的一部分都烧坏了。张纪英抱着垂危的孩子哭了起来，闻讯赶来的村干部紧急商量怎样抢救孩子。从正旗村到县城要两天两夜才能走到。大家正急得没法，忽然有人说：“和对岸苏联老大哥联系一下吧。”村干部一听是好主意，马上跑到江边去打信号。联系的结果，对岸的苏联朋友要求马上把孩子送过去治疗。就这样，张纪英抱着严重烧伤的孩子，当晚来到了苏联的库兹?佐夫村。
    在库兹?佐夫村，医生鲁季和护士们立即给孩子消毒，注射急救针。农庄的党委书记、主席都在医院里不安地等着消息。当医生检查完孟宪国的伤势，书记和主席焦急地问：“怎么样，能不能挽救？”
    “情况很危险，需要和契尔尼耶沃村医院联系，转到那里去。”
    农庄主席一听，马上亲自摇起了电话。契尔尼耶沃村医院院长罗艮娜接到电话，立即派了一名护士和一辆救护车出发，同时进行手术前的准备。这一夜，不知有多少苏联人民为了抢救一个中国孩子而不眠，更不知有多少苏联人民关心这个中国孩子的生命。第二天，太阳升起来的时候，抢救孟宪国的手术做完了。
    契尔尼耶沃村医院全体医务人员轮班护理这个中国孩子。本来有两三个人就够了，但是谁也不愿意放弃看护中国孩子的机会。四十多天过去了，孩子的伤势一天比一天好。不会说俄语的张纪英只能用热泪和各式各样的手势来表达自己感激的心情。苏联朋友用温暖的微笑和他们最爱说的简单的汉语“苏中友好”、“不要客气”来安慰张纪英。
    孩子的伤势大部分痊愈了。唯独胳臂上有两处烧伤不封口，痊愈的地方也留下了难看的伤疤。张纪英本来想，剩下的部分可以回国治疗了。可是苏联医生坚决不同意。他们说：我们的责任是把孩子全部治好，中国是我们伟大的朋友，我们一定要对孩子负责到底。
    要把孩子治好，又要孩子脸上不留下难看的伤疤，唯一的办法是给孩子植皮。为了植皮，张纪英母子被转送到提格达区医院。正在医院中实习的莱奇欣斯克市医药学校学生，女共青团员菲拉托娃和多洛日基娜在全医院谁来看护中国孩子的争论中，夺得了看护中国孩子的机会。植皮本来可以用母亲的皮肤，可是苏联朋友认为，母亲要照顾孩子。外科医生、共产党员哥马洛夫决定用苏联人的皮肤给孩子植皮。
    为了中国弟兄的孩子，全医院人人要求用自己的皮肤植皮，于是一场争论又开始了。争论到最后，菲拉托娃和多洛日基娜又夺得了这项“权利”，她们两人坚持“我们身体健康，孩子又是我们护理的，我们应当有优先权”。为了怕张纪英不忍心割苏联人的皮，第一次植皮是背着她进行的。当第二次植皮轮到多洛日基娜，张纪英坚持要用自己的，她不忍心再割苏联朋友的皮肤了。“她们都是姑娘，还没有结婚，割了皮要难看的，还是用我的吧。”张纪英向医生请求着。可是多洛日基娜怎样也不肯让。“既然允许菲拉托娃，就应该允许我。”当多洛日基娜带着满意的表情走进手术室的时候，张纪英悄悄地站在门口，等手术完了，张纪英的前襟已经被感激的眼泪湿透了。
    两次植皮，苏联姑娘为中国孩子献出了六百平方毫米的皮肤。当张纪英向菲拉托娃和多洛日基娜表示感谢的时候，这两个姑娘却微笑地说：“在抢救中国孩子的生命中我们尽了一份力量，这是我们最大的光荣和幸福。”
    孟宪国经过伊尔库茨克市儿童医院的最后治疗，今年5月初完全好了。母子两人在苏维埃的国土上受了一年多最温暖的照顾，学会了俄语，健康愉快地回到祖国的家乡来了。
    在成千上万中苏友谊的故事中，这是一段没有离奇情节的插曲。但是库兹?佐夫村农庄党委书记和主席的焦虑，罗艮娜不眠的一夜，伊尔库茨克市儿童医院里的鲜花、菲拉托娃和多洛日基娜身上的伤痕和孟宪国身上的皮肤，构成一朵美丽的友谊之花，它使全中国人民、全世界人民不会忘记，也使全世界的反动派知道，中苏两国人民的友谊是血肉相联的友谊，是任何人、任何办法也不能拆开的友谊。
