    Sows Produce Three Litters of Piglets a Year
    In the pig farm of Liu Huanming Brigade of Shimen Song People's Commune in Shou Zhang County, Shandong Province, ten high-yielding sows are able to produce a litter of piglets every four months. Each sow can produce an average of 28 piglets per year, which is ten more than local ordinary sows. Since the beginning of this year, these ten high-yielding sows have produced 153 more piglets than last year.
    The high productivity of these ten sows is mainly due to the good management and feeding by the management personnel. Card registration is implemented for all sows in the farm, with records of the sows' mating and expected delivery dates. At the same time, good nest-sharing objects are selected, and planned nest-sharing breeding of the piglets is carried out.

    一年产三窝小猪
    山东寿张县石门宋人民公社刘焕明大队养猪场，有十头高产母猪每四个月就能产一窝小猪，每头每年平均能产二十八头小猪，比当地一般母猪多产十头。今年以来，这十头高产母猪已比去年多产了一百五十三头小猪。
    这十头母猪能够高产，主要是由于管理人员饲养的好，对全场母猪实行卡片登记，作出母猪配种预产期记录，同时选好并窝对象，有计划地将所产仔猪实行并窝哺育。
