    To See Who Benefits?
    Zheng Yingnian

    A revolutionary must possess keen senses, be adept at distinguishing right from wrong, and not be as muddled as that "girl" Pelageya in "Dead Souls," who "couldn't even tell left from right" at the crossroads.

    Naturally, the boundaries of some things are very clear, and anyone can tell them apart. But some things, though different in essence, are very similar in appearance, like copper sulfide resembling gold. When encountering such situations, it becomes difficult to distinguish. The Lüshi Chunqiu says: "What greatly deceives people is the similarity of things." This saying is very true. Currently, right-leaning opportunists are completely standing on the bourgeois position, attacking the Party's Marxist-Leninist line; but in order to confuse right and wrong, they stubbornly pretend to support Marxism-Leninism. If we do not pay attention to identification, we will mistake the phenomenon for the essence, mistakenly swallow their sugar-coated poison pill, and not even know that we have been poisoned.

    How to improve our senses and distinguish right from wrong? To theoretically expose and refute all reactionary fallacies and heresies, a certain level of theoretical cultivation is certainly needed; however, it is by no means to say that a person is only qualified to distinguish right from wrong after reading a large number of books. We often see some people whose "noses are blocked," who have read many books, and whose heads are simply like bookshelves, but it has not made them any smarter. Therefore, reading books is important, but more important is the issue of stance and method. To be good at identifying right from wrong, we must adopt the method of class analysis that Chairman Mao often taught us.

    In a society with classes, everyone belongs to a certain class, and no one's thoughts and feelings can go beyond their own class. Lu Xun has a passage that is both vivid and profound: "Of course, 'joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness are human emotions,' but the poor never have the annoyance of losing money in the stock exchange, and the oil magnate would not know the hardship suffered by the old woman in Beijing picking coal cinders. The famine victims in the disaster area probably would not grow orchids like the rich man's old master, and Jiao Da in the Jia Mansion does not love Lin Daiyu." ("Complete Works of Lu Xun," Volume 4, page 164) Due to the different class interests, each class will maintain its own interests. Taking the people's communes as an example, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants think they are very good, but the right-leaning opportunists think they were "established too early" and "badly managed." This is entirely the voice of the bourgeoisie. Naturally, sometimes some people who directly defend the interests of the exploiting classes may not necessarily be landlords or capitalists themselves; some are servants hired by the exploiting classes, and some are people who have been influenced or captured by the ideology of the exploiting classes. Even so, various social opinions always represent the interests of a certain class; the kind of purely objective opinions that claim to be beyond class interests are just deceptive nonsense.

    Whether a certain statement or measure is correct, we can identify it by first seeing which class it benefits. Whether something is correct or not is an objective existence, not determined by people's will. In our view, only thoughts that reflect objective laws can be called truth; if they do not conform to objective laws, no matter how eloquently they are spoken, they are only fallacies. From the surface, the right-leaning opportunists seem to respect objectivity and experience very much. In their statements, there are also materials and examples. But they are actually subjective idealist empiricists. They are self-centered, regarding experience as subjective feelings and experiences unrelated to the objective world. In plain terms, they think what suits their taste is right, and what does not suit their taste is wrong.

    To observe social and historical issues from the perspective of dialectical materialism, we must first see that social history develops according to its inherent laws. The face and changes of a society are determined by the mode of production of material goods. When the mode of production changes, society will change. But the change in the mode of production is realized through people's activities. In the capitalist mode of production, the proletariat is in a state of being exploited, so it demands to reform this old mode of production, establish a new mode of production, and continuously push the revolution forward. As the "Communist Manifesto" says: the proletariat "has nothing to lose in this revolution but its chains. They have a world to win." When the proletariat is liberated, all working people are also liberated. The bourgeoisie, on the other hand, as an exploiting class, demands to preserve this old capitalist mode of production and prevent social development. Then, from the perspective of class interests, the objective process of social development is completely consistent with the interests of the proletariat; it is not only inconsistent with the interests of the bourgeoisie, but also completely opposed to them. Therefore, Chairman Mao said that any truth is in line with the interests of the people, and any error is not in line with the interests of the people. ("Selected Works of Mao Zedong," Volume 3, page 1096)

    Since things are like this, to distinguish whether the views on social and historical issues are correct, we can use our noses to sniff and see who it benefits. If it is a truth that reflects the laws of social development, it must conform to the interests of the proletariat and the working people; conversely, if it is contrary to the interests of the proletariat and the working people, it must be a fallacy and heresy that violates the laws of social development.

    Our country is still in the transition period from capitalism to socialism. The socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production has only been basically completed. Capitalists still receive fixed interest, and a small part of the means of production in rural areas is still privately owned; especially the bourgeois ideas in the minds of some people have not been transformed; therefore, the class struggle has not ended. Sometimes it is eased, and sometimes it becomes tense. Currently, our struggle with right-leaning opportunism on issues such as the line is a continuation of the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie over the two roads. Therefore, we must not fall asleep under the covers at any time. We must firmly grasp the method of class analysis, pay attention to which class various social ideas benefit, and resolutely struggle against all reactionary ideas to firmly defend the cause of the Party and the people.

    要看对谁有利？
    郑英年
    一个革命者，要有锐敏的嗅觉，善于辨别是非，不能像“死魂灵”中那个贝拉格耶“丫头”那样糊涂，在十字路口，“连左右也分不清”。
    自然，有些事情的界限是很明显的，谁也辨别得出来。可是有些事情，虽其本质不同，但其貌却很相似，好像硫化铜之像黄金那样。碰到这样的情况，也就难于辨别了。吕氏春秋上说：“使人大迷惑者，必物之相似也。”这话很有道理。目前右倾机会主义者，完全是站在资产阶级立场，攻击党的马克思列宁主义路线；可是他们为着混淆是非，却硬装着拥护马克思列宁主义的样子。如果我们不注意识别，就会把现象当作本质，误吃他们那裹着糖衣的毒丸，自己中了毒还不知道。
    如何来提高嗅觉，辨别是非呢？对于一切反动的谬论邪说，从理论上加以揭露和驳斥，固然需要有一定的理论修养；然而绝不是说，一个人只有读了一大堆书之后，才有资格辨别是非。我们常看到有些“鼻子不通”的人，书读的并不少，脑袋简直像书箱，然而并没有使他们聪明些。所以，读书固然重要，但更重要的是立场和方法的问题。我们要善于识别是非，就必须采取毛主席经常告诉我们的那种阶级分析的方法。
    在有阶级存在的社会中，每个人都属于一定的阶级，任何人的思想感情都不能超出他本阶级之外。鲁迅有段话讲得形象而深刻：“自然，‘喜怒哀乐，人之情也’，然而穷人决无开交易所折本的懊恼，煤油大王那会知道北京检煤渣老婆子身受的酸辛，饥区的灾民，大约总不去种兰花，像阔人的老太爷一样，贾府上的焦大，也不爱林妹妹的。”（“鲁迅全集”第四卷一六四页）由于阶级利害的不同，各个阶级就会各维护各的利益。拿人民公社来说，广大的贫农、下中农都认为好得很，可是右倾机会主义者却认为“办早了”，“办糟了”。这完全是资产阶级的声音。自然，有时候有些直接为剥削阶级利益辩护的人，不一定他本人就是地主、资本家；有的是剥削阶级雇用的奴仆，有的是为剥削阶级思想所影响或俘虏的人。虽然如此，但是社会上的各种言论，总是代表一定阶级的利益的；那种标榜超出阶级利益之外的纯客观的言论，只是骗人的鬼话。
    某种言论和措施是否正确，我们首先看看它到底对哪个阶级有利，就可以识别出来。所谓正确与否，这是客观的存在，而不是人们的意志所决定的。在我们看来，只有反映了客观规律的思想，才能被称之为真理；如不符合客观规律的，尽管讲得天花乱坠，只能是谬论。右倾机会主义者，从表面看来，他们似乎也很尊重客观、尊重经验。在他们的言论中，也有材料、有例子。但是他们实际上是主观唯心主义的经验主义。他们是以自我为中心，把经验看作是与客观世界无关的主观感觉与体验。通俗的说，合他们口味的他们就认为对了，不合他们口味的他们就认为错了。
    用辩证唯物主义的观点来观察社会历史问题，首先必须看到社会历史是按其固有规律发展的。一个社会的面貌和变化，决定于物质资料的生产方式，生产方式变化了，社会就会变化。但是生产方式的变化是通过人们的活动来实现的。在资本主义生产方式中，无产阶级处于被剥削的地位，它就要求改革这种旧的生产方式，建立新的生产方式，并把革命不断推向前进。正如“共产党宣言”说的：无产阶级“在这个革命中只会失去自己颈上的一条锁链。他们所能获得的却是整个世界。”无产阶级得到解放，全体劳动群众也就得到解放。而资产阶级则由于是剥削阶级，它就要求保存这种旧的资本主义的生产方式，阻止社会的发展。那末，从阶级利益这个角度来看，社会发展的客观进程与无产阶级的利益是完全一致的；与资产阶级的利益，不但不一致，而且还是完全相对立的。所以毛主席说，任何真理都是符合于人民利益的，任何错误都是不符合于人民利益的。（“毛泽东选集”第三卷一○九六页）
    既然事情是这样，我们要辨别有关社会历史问题的观点是否正确，就可以用鼻子嗅一嗅，看看它到底对谁有利。如果是反映社会发展规律的真理，它必然符合于无产阶级及劳动人民的利益；反过来说，如果是和无产阶级及劳动人民利益相违背的，它就必然是违反社会发展规律的谬论邪说。
    我们的国家还处在由资本主义向社会主义的过渡时期，生产资料所有制方面的社会主义改造才基本完成，资本家还拿定息，农村中还有一小部分生产资料为私人所有；特别是一部分人头脑中的资产阶级思想尚未改造过来；因之，阶级斗争并未结束，有时虽然缓和些，有时就会紧张些。目前我们和右倾机会主义在路线等问题上的斗争，就是无产阶级同资产阶级关于两条道路斗争的继续。所以我们任何时候都不能蒙着被子睡大觉，必须紧紧掌握阶级分析的方法，注意各种社会思想到底对谁有利，及时地向一切反动思想进行斗争，坚决保卫党和人民的事业。
