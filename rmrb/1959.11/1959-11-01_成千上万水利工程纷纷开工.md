Thousands of Water Conservancy Projects Commence Construction
More than 30 million commune members fight on construction sites, kicking off a national water conservancy movement

Xinhua News Agency, October 31st: The winter farmland water conservancy construction movement, aiming for a great leap forward this winter and spring, has been vigorously launched in all provinces and regions across the country. Thousands of small reservoirs, ponds, machine wells, and land leveling projects, independently undertaken by the people's communes and teams in various localities, have already commenced. Some large and medium-sized backbone projects, collaboratively undertaken by many counties and people's communes, including large and medium-sized reservoirs, river network projects, and large-scale water diversion projects, have also started. Some large projects that were not completed in the past, such as the Miyun Reservoir in Hebei Province and Beijing Municipality, the Weishan Water Conservancy Hub in Shandong Province, and the Ganfu Plain Irrigation Project in Jiangxi Province, have also resumed construction. According to the reports from 27 provinces, cities, and autonomous regions at the national telephone conference convened by the Ministry of Agriculture on the 28th, the number of people currently working on projects nationwide has reached approximately 20 million, and adding those engaged in winter irrigation and land leveling, the total reaches more than 30 million. Compared with the winter construction last year, the start is earlier and the scale is much larger. It is expected that by mid-November, as the autumn harvest work gradually concludes, the winter construction movement will usher in a high tide even more magnificent than in 1958.

Due to the experience of two years of large-scale winter construction, and the foundation of the people's communes in fighting drought this summer and autumn, the broad masses of cadres and people have further recognized that water conservancy is the lifeline of agriculture, and that continuing to vigorously develop water conservancy is a crucial key to ensuring the continued leap forward of agriculture. Therefore, this year, the start of winter construction in various places is generally earlier than in previous years. According to the Ministry of Agriculture's statistics on October 11, the number of people working on projects nationwide, plus those engaged in land leveling and winter irrigation, was already about 20 million at that time. After the issuance of the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on continuing to carry out large-scale water conservancy construction and manure accumulation movements this winter and spring, many regions immediately held meetings, revised plans, and made further arrangements for winter construction. Recently, the number of people working on projects in various places has been increasing sharply. In Hebei and Henan, the number of people working on projects has reached more than 3 million, and in Shandong, Gansu, and Hubei, it has reached more than 1 million, and in Guangdong, it has reached 800,000. Winter construction headquarters have been established in various special districts, counties, and many people's communes. In areas focusing on soil and water conservation, soil and water conservation work headquarters have also been established, led by the secretaries, to guide the construction. The masses are bursting with enthusiasm. After studying the central instructions, a commune in Pujiang County, Zhejiang Province, with a water conservancy army of 2,000 people, completed a reservoir with a storage capacity of 700,000 cubic meters in four days. The original planned earthwork in Xinyang County, Henan Province, was 11.4 million cubic meters. After studying the instructions, it was increased to 73 million cubic meters, an increase of more than five times. Xinjiang Hami Prefecture, Anda County in Heilongjiang Province, Qinghai, Yunnan and other provinces are also mobilizing troops and fighting hard.

This year, in winter construction, various localities continued to implement the policy of focusing on storage, focusing on communes, focusing on small-scale projects, and combining large, medium, and small-scale projects. For example, among the 1,105 projects that have commenced in Guizhou Province, 870 are small-scale projects undertaken by communes and teams, and 235 are large and medium-sized backbone projects. Anhui Province plans to build as many as tens of thousands of small reservoirs. Other provinces and regions, such as Jilin, Liaoning, Inner Mongolia, Ningxia, Shaanxi, Sichuan, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Fujian, will also mobilize people's communes to build small water storage projects this year, and areas with more small projects in the past will also continue to build them on a large scale. This year, there has been a significant increase in large and medium-sized backbone projects in various places. In solving investment, equipment, and technology for these large and medium-sized projects, most emphasized self-reliance and self-solution as the main approach, and fully promoted the enthusiasm of the people's communes for large-scale collaboration. In Jiangxi Province's winter construction, criticisms were made of certain "outreach factions" who only knew how to rely on state equipment and funds to carry out water conservancy, and the fighting slogan of "making cement ourselves, burning lime ourselves, making tools ourselves, raising funds ourselves, concocting explosives ourselves, and learning technology ourselves" was put forward, and a competition upsurge of comparing drive, quality, and safety, and contracting time, tasks, and quality was launched. At present, various factories have been established on the water conservancy construction sites in this province, totaling 1,130, manufacturing 225,000 tools, and training 20,000 technical cadres and workers.

This winter and spring, various localities will also repair a large number of unfinished projects from the past and improve many existing projects to give full play to their benefits and improve their ability to resist drought and prevent floods. To this end, various localities have also combined winter construction with land leveling, ditch digging, and land preparation to create garden-style fields. The work of creating garden-style fields in Henan, Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, and Shaanxi provinces has been carried out vigorously. By around the 20th, the four provinces of Henan, etc., had leveled more than 80 million mu of land, of which more than 60 million mu had been converted into garden-style fields. Henan Province has invested a maximum of 5 million laborers in garden-style fields, and has leveled and furrowed more than 40 million mu. In Shijiazhuang, Handan, Tianjin and other places in Hebei Province, 6.9 million mu of garden-style fields were completed in one month, with an average daily progress of 230,000 mu. Shandong Province has built a total of more than 40 million mu of raised fields and garden fields. In addition, various localities have also paid attention to water storage and winter irrigation.

This year's water conservancy movement was launched after the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, based on the ideological foundation of opposing rightism and boosting morale. Therefore, the leadership is proactive, the masses are energetic, and the preparations are solid. As early as the middle and upper旬of October, most provinces and regions across the country had held water conservancy meetings, determined tasks, arranged labor, and carried out surveying and design, training cadres, and other work. Now, various localities are studying the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, further examining right-leaning emotions, and boosting the enthusiasm for winter construction. Commercial, transportation, and other departments in various localities are also stepping up their support for the winter water conservancy construction movement.

### 成千上万水利工程纷纷开工

    水泥自己造　石灰自己烧　工具自己作
    经费自己筹　炸药自己熬　技术自己学
    成千上万水利工程纷纷开工
    三千多万公社社员奋战工地，揭开了全国水利运动的序幕
    据新华社31日讯　大干一冬春的农田水利冬修运动，在全国各省区都已猛烈地展开。成千上万的由各地人民公社社队自办的小水库、塘坝、机井和平整耕地等工程已经开工；一部分由许多县、许多人民公社协作兴办的大、中型骨干工程，包括大中型水库、河网化工程、大规模的引水工程也已经开工；一部分过去未完成的大工程，如河北省、北京市的密云水库等大水库工程、山东省的位山水利枢纽工程、江西省的赣抚平原灌溉工程等也已经复工。据28日农业部召开的全国电话会议上二十七个省、市、自治区的汇报，目前全国上工人数已两千万左右，加上冬灌和平整耕地的达三千多万人。同去年冬修比较起来，开工较早，规模也大得多。预计到11月中旬各地三秋工作次第结束，冬修运动就将出现一个比1958年气势更加磅礴的高潮。
    由于有两年大规模冬修的经验，有人民公社今年夏秋抗旱的基础，广大干部和群众进一步认识了水利是农业的命脉，继续大力兴修水利是保证农业继续跃进的重要关键。因此，今年各地冬修一般动手比往年为早。据农业部10月11日的统计，当时全国上工人数加上平整耕地和冬灌的人数就约有两千万。中共中央和国务院关于今冬明春继续开展大规模兴修水利和积肥运动的指示发布后，不少地区立即开会，修订计划，并且对冬修做了进一步部署。最近各地上工人数都在猛烈地增加，河北、河南上工人数都已达三百万以上，山东、甘肃、湖北都已达一百几十万，广东已达八十万。各地专县和许多人民公社都建立了冬修指挥部，以水土保持为重点的地区还成立了水土保持工作指挥部，由书记挂帅，领导兴修。群众干劲冲天，浙江浦江县一个公社二千水利大军，学习中央指示后，四天完成一座蓄水七十万立米的水库。河南信阳县原订土石方为一千一百四十万立米，学习指示后，提高到七千三百万立米，增加五倍多。新疆哈密专区、黑龙江省安达县，青海、云南等省也正在调兵遣将，大干起来。
    今年冬修，各地继续贯彻执行了以蓄为主、社办为主、小型为主和大中小型工程相结合的方针。如贵州省现已开工的一千一百零五处工程中，社队举办的小型工程为八百七十处，大中型骨干工程为二百三十五处；安徽要修小型水库达十几万处；其他如吉林、辽宁、内蒙古、宁夏、陕西、四川、广东、广西、福建等省区今年都要发动人民公社大修小型蓄水工程，过去小型工程较多的地区也要继续大修。今年各地大中型骨干工程有了显著增加，这些大中型工程在解决投资、器材和技术方面多数强调了自力更生、自力解决为主，并且充分发扬了人民公社大协作的积极性。江西省冬修中，批判了某些只知依靠国家器材、资金才能兴办水利的“伸手派”，提出了“水泥自己造，石灰自己烧，工具自己造，经费自己筹，炸药自己熬，技术自己学”的战斗口号，并开展了比干劲、比质量、比安全和包时间、包任务、包质量的竞赛热潮。目前这个省的水利工地已办各种工厂一千一百三十个，制造工具二十二万五千件，训练了技术干部和工人二万人。
    今冬明春，各地还将兴修大量过去未成工程和改善许多已有的工程，使之充分发挥效益和提高抗旱防涝能力。为此，各地还结合冬修进行了平整土地、开沟、整地打畦等园田化工作。河南、河北、山东、山西、陕西等省园田化工作开展得轰轰烈烈。到20日左右，河南等四省已整地八千多万亩，其中有六千多万亩做到了园田化。河南省投入园田化的劳力，最多达到五百万人，已平地打畦四千多万亩。河北省石家庄、邯郸、天津等地，一个月时间完成园田化面积六百九十万亩，平均日进度达二十三万亩。山东省已修起的畦田、园田共达四千多万亩。此外，各地还注意了蓄水和冬灌。
    今年的水利运动是在党的八届八中全会后，在反右倾、鼓干劲的思想基础上开展起来的，因此领导主动，群众干劲足，准备工作踏实。早在10月上中旬，全国大部省区都已开过水利会议，确定了任务，安排了劳力，并进行勘测设计、培训干部等工作。现在，各地又在学习中共中央和国务院的指示，进一步检查右倾情绪和大鼓冬修的干劲。各地商业、交通等部门对水利冬修运动也正加紧支援。
