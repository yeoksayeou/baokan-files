Xinhua News Agency, November 8th: Tokyo dispatch: More than 20,000 citizens of Tokyo participated today in a garden party jointly held by the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party (JCP), the JCP Tokyo Metropolitan Committee, and the editorial department of the JCP's central organ newspaper, "Akahata," to celebrate the publication of the 3,000th issue of "Akahata" and the 42nd anniversary of the October Revolution.

The sky over Tokyo was clear today. From 9 a.m., workers, young women, students, intellectuals, and children streamed into the Hamarikyu Gardens, the venue for the garden party.

After the garden party was declared open at 10 a.m., Sanzo Nosaka, Chairman of the Japanese Communist Party, delivered a speech. He emphasized the important significance of the October Revolution for the liberation and progress of mankind. He called on the attendees to work hard towards the bright future illuminated by the October Revolution.

Nosaka then spoke about the Nobusuke Kishi government's plot to revise the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." He said that the revision of the "Security Treaty" meant establishing a U.S.-Japan military alliance hostile to China and the Soviet Union, which was completely incompatible with the Japanese people's desire to build a peaceful, independent, democratic, and neutral Japan, and therefore must be prevented.

Nosaka pointed out that the Japanese Constitution clearly stipulates that Japan should not maintain armed forces. Therefore, we fully agree with and support Khrushchev's proposal for complete disarmament, and we must also uphold this peaceful Constitution.

Finally, Nosaka called on all attendees to strengthen and promote "Akahata," the only daily newspaper of the Japanese working class, and to strive to strengthen the Party's strength.

Many wonderful programs were performed at the garden party, and the masses dispersed happily until dusk.

Xinhua News Agency, November 8th: Tokyo dispatch: A massive "Rally to Stop the Revision of the Security Treaty, Oppose Coal Mine Worker Layoffs, and Unemployment" was held today in Omuta City, Kyushu. 70,000 workers and their family members, as well as representatives from trade unions across the region, participated in the rally. The rally was organized by the Kyushu Regional Joint Struggle Council of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo).

The rally unanimously adopted an appeal to workers nationwide, calling on the working class to launch a general strike during November and December to stop the revision of the "Security Treaty."

The rally also passed a declaration stating that, for the sake of peace, labor, and the right to survival, we oppose layoffs and the intensification of labor through "enterprise rationalization." The declaration expressed the determination to fight for the maintenance of livelihood, the complete abolition of the "performance rating" system, and to demand that the Nobusuke Kishi government adopt a peaceful policy.

Mitsui Mining Company is currently planning to lay off 2,200 of the 16,000 workers at its Miike Coal Mine in Omuta City. Therefore, Omuta City has become the largest stronghold for the Japanese Coal Miners' Union to launch a struggle against the "coal mining industry rationalization" plan. The Kyushu region's coal production accounts for more than 50% of Japan's total coal production.

Inejiro Asanuma, Secretary-General of the Japan Socialist Party, led 20 Socialist Party Diet members to participate in the rally. Asanuma said at a press conference that day that the Socialist Party fully supported the coal miners' struggle.

    日共举行集会庆祝“赤旗报”出版三千期
    野坂号召反对“安全条约”
    九州七万工人示威反对解雇
    新华社8日讯　东京消息：东京两万多名市民今天参加了由日本共产党中央委员会、日共东京都委员会和日共中央机关报“赤旗报”编辑局联合举行的游园会，庆祝“赤旗报”出版三千期和十月革命四十二周年。
    东京今天天空晴朗，从上午九时起，工人、青年妇女、学生、知识分子和儿童就源源不断地走进游园会会场滨离宫公园。
    游园会在十时宣布开会后，日本共产党主席野坂参三发表了讲话。他强调指出十月革命对人类解放和进步的重要意义。他号召与会者为走向十月革命所照耀的光明前途而努力。
    野坂接着谈到岸信介政府企图修改日美“安全条约”的阴谋。他说，“安全条约”的修改，意味着要建立敌视中苏两国的日美军事同盟，这是同日本人民要求建立和平、独立、民主、中立的日本的愿望完全不相容的，因此必须予以阻止。
    野坂指出，日本宪法清楚地规定，日本不保持武装力量，因此我们完全同意和支持赫鲁晓夫关于全面裁军的建议，我们也必须维护这项和平的宪法。
    野坂最后号召全体与会者为加强和推广日本工人阶级唯一的日报——“赤旗报”，为加强党的力量而奋斗。
    在游园会上表演了许多精彩的节目，群众一直到黄昏才欢乐而散。
    据新华社8日讯　东京消息：九州大牟田市今天举行了声势浩大的“阻止修改安全条约、反对解雇煤矿工人和失业大会”。七万名工人和工人家属以及各地工会代表参加了这次大会。大会是由日本工会总评议会九州地方共同斗争会议举办的。
    大会一致通过了给全国工人的呼吁书，号召工人阶级为阻止修改“安全条约”，在11月到12月期间展开总罢工。
    大会还通过宣言说，我们为了和平、劳动和生存的权利，反对解雇和加强劳动强度的“企业合理化”。宣言表示要为维护生活、全面废除“勤务评定”制度和要求岸信介政府采取和平政策而斗争。
    三井矿山公司资方目前计划把它在大牟田市的三池煤矿的一万六千名工人解雇二千二百名，因此大牟田市成为日本煤矿工会展开反对“煤矿工业合理化”计划斗争的最大据点。九州地区的煤产量占日本全国煤产量的50％以上。
    日本社会党书记长浅沼稻次郎率领社会党国会议员二十名参加了这个大会。浅沼当天在记者招待会上说，社会党全面支持煤矿工人的斗争。
