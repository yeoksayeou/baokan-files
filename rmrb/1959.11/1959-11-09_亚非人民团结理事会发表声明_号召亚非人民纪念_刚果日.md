Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, November 7th: The Secretariat of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Council issued a statement today, calling on the Afro-Asian people to designate November 25th as "Congo Day."

The statement called on Afro-Asian regions to hold rallies and demonstrations on this day to condemn Belgium's atrocities in the Congo and support the demands of the Congolese people.

The statement demanded that the Belgian authorities immediately release all political prisoners, including Congolese nationalist leader Patrice Lumumba; immediately abolish all decrees prohibiting freedom of speech, publication, assembly, and association; an international jurist committee, including a prominent African and a prominent Asian, immediately investigate the inhumane atrocities of the Belgian authorities; and immediately recognize the right of the Congo to freedom, convene a constituent assembly, and draft a constitution for a free Congo.

The statement said that the new offensive of the Belgian imperialists against nationalist forces is a dying struggle to suppress the Congolese nationalist movement and stifle the people's demand for independence.

After reviewing the recent developments in the Congo, the statement said that for a long time, the Belgian authorities have claimed that they are "ideal" colonizers and that the Congo is a "willing" colony. However, the Congolese people have exposed this lie of the Belgian authorities through heroic struggle.

The statement added that it appears that the Belgian government is following in De Gaulle's footsteps, announcing so-called "elections" in the Congo in December. The natural reaction of Congolese nationalists to these deceptive "elections" has been met with new terror and suppression. The statement pointed out that the so-called "round table conference" proposed by the Belgian rulers is mainly a means for the imperialists to deceive world public opinion and undermine true freedom.

    亚非人民团结理事会发表声明
    号召亚非人民纪念“刚果日”
    新华社开罗7日电　亚非人民团结理事会书记处今天发表声明，号召亚非人民把11月25日定为“刚果日”。
    声明要求亚非各地在这一天举行集会和示威游行，谴责比利时在刚果的暴行，支持刚果人民的要求。
    声明要求比利时当局立即释放包括刚果民族主义领袖帕特里斯·卢蒙巴在内的一切政治犯；立即取消一切禁止言论、出版和集会结社自由的法令；由一个包括一位著名非洲人和一位著名亚洲人参加的国际法学家委员会立即调查比利时当局的非人道暴行；立即承认刚果的自由权利，召开制宪议会，起草自由刚果宪法。
    声明说，比利时帝国主义者对民族主义力量的新进攻，是企图镇压刚果民族主义运动和压制人民要求独立的呼声的垂死挣扎。
    声明在回顾了刚果最近的事态发展以后说，长期以来，比利时当局声称，他们是“理想”的殖民者，刚果是一个“甘心情愿”的殖民地。但是，刚果人民通过英勇斗争揭穿了比利时当局的这种谎言。
    声明又说，看来，比利时政府正在步戴高乐的后尘，宣布12月在刚果举行所谓“选举”。刚果民族主义者对这种骗人的“选举”的自然反应，却遭到了新的恐怖镇压。声明指出，比利时统治者提出的所谓“圆桌会议”，主要是帝国主义者欺骗世界舆论和破坏真正自由的手段。
