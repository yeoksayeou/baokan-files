Xinhua News Agency, November 14th, New York Dispatch: The Wage Policy Committee of the United Steelworkers of America issued a statement on the 12th condemning the Eisenhower government and the courts for invoking the Taft-Hartley Act to force steelworkers to return to work. The committee unanimously decided that if labor and management cannot reach a fair and reasonable agreement during the eighty-day resumption of work period, they will resume the strike after the period expires. The statement pointed out that the U.S. government imposed the back-to-work order on the workers at the critical moment when the capitalists felt difficulty after the striking workers had endured prolonged suffering. The statement said that the U.S. government's "back-to-work order deprives five hundred thousand Americans of a fundamental democratic freedom—the right to strike." The statement also said that the eighty days of forced return to work is "eighty days of darkness" for American steelworkers and the American labor movement.

    美国钢铁工会发表声明
    八十天后不能取得协议就再罢工
    谴责政府帮助资本家强迫工人复工
    新华社14日讯　纽约消息：美国联合钢铁工人工会工资政策委员会12日发表声明，谴责艾森豪威尔政府和法院援用塔夫脱—哈特莱法强迫钢铁工人复工。委员会一致决定，如果在八十天复工期间劳资双方不能达成公平合理的协议，期满后就恢复罢工。声明指出，美国政府正是在罢工工人忍受了长期痛苦之后使资方感到困难的紧急时刻，把复工令强加到工人头上的。声明说，美国政府的“复工令使五十万美国人失去了基本的民主自由——罢工的权利”。声明还说，被强迫复工的八十天对美国钢铁工人和美国劳工运动是“八十天的阴暗时期”。
