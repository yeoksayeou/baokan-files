Small Blast Furnaces Shine Red
    ——Introducing the Experience of Large-Scale Bumper Harvests from Small Blast Furnaces in Wuhu Prefecture, Anhui Province
Great Leap Forward　High Speed
    Wuhu Prefecture is located in the southern part of Anhui Province. It is extremely rich in mineral resources. However, before the great iron and steel campaign, like many fraternal regions, it was a blank slate in terms of the iron and steel industry. There wasn't a single blast furnace, and no one understood smelting technology. In the Great Leap Forward year of 1958, the people of the entire prefecture launched a mass movement to build iron and steel, constructing a batch of earthen furnaces and experimental small blast furnaces below three cubic meters. After initially mastering ironmaking technology, they concentrated their efforts to construct small blast furnaces in batches. Under the slogan of "Having nothing but a pair of hands, working hard and diligently, iron flows everywhere!" Party secretaries at all levels took personal command, and workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers rushed to the front lines from all directions, rushing to manufacture equipment, build blast furnaces, mine and dig coal, build kilns to produce coke, and transport grain and grass for the iron and steel industry. The masses described the situation at the time: "Wuhu City is seething, every household is full of activity, thousands of troops and horses are all on the battlefront, and blast furnace groups rise up overnight!" In the short four months from August to the end of last year, 180 small blast furnaces with a volume of eight cubic meters or more were built, with a total effective volume of 1,630 cubic meters. By the end of 1958, the entire region had produced more than 38,000 tons of good iron.
    Since the beginning of this year, the production of small blast furnaces throughout the region has continued to leap forward on the basis of consolidation and improvement. All ironmaking units have extensively and deeply mobilized the workers and masses, focusing on increasing the utilization coefficient, and launched a production increase and savings movement for high quality, high yield, and low cost large-scale bumper harvests. At present, the region regularly maintains 98 small blast furnaces in production, with an average utilization coefficient of 1.915 tons, of which half reach 2 to 3 or more. The iron produced also meets the quality requirements for steelmaking and sand casting. This year, the entire region can overfulfill the state plan by 70%, victoriously realizing the planned target of producing more than 300,000 tons of pig iron annually, which is more than the total national iron production of 252,000 tons in 1949 by more than 50,000 tons. At the same time, the entire region also has half of the furnaces on standby. Wuhu Prefecture has gloriously become one of the ironmaking bases of the national iron and steel industry.
    "Great Leap Forward, High Speed" – this is the general situation of the great development of the iron and steel industry in the Wuhu area over the past year, and it is also a victory achieved by resolutely implementing the Party's General Line.
Key Lies in Leadership
    There are many reasons for achieving large-scale bumper harvests in small blast furnaces, but the primary key lies in leadership.
    In April of this year, when the large-scale bumper harvest movement began, the first problems encountered were: unstable furnace conditions, many accidents, low output, high coke ratio, and some cadres lacked confidence in increasing the utilization coefficient. Some people said, "It would be good if the utilization coefficient of small blast furnaces reaches 0.8." Some said, "The ore is not good enough, there is not enough coke, it is beyond our capability to achieve high output." Some said, "The furnace is old, high output requires opening a new furnace." Others believed that "There is a lot of rain in the south, it is impossible to increase the utilization coefficient..." When the utilization coefficient of the small blast furnace of Jiangnan Automobile Factory in Wuhu City was about to reach 2, they said, "Concentrating efforts on one or two furnaces is possible, but it is difficult to do it universally," and so on. Without removing these ideological obstacles, the large-scale bumper harvest movement would obviously be difficult to carry out. Therefore, under the direct leadership of the prefectural Party committee, the masses were first mobilized to use methods that combined the substantive with the ideological, including "studying" (studying the resolutions of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee and the high-yield experiences of fraternal regions), "teaching" (seizing the advanced furnaces with the same conditions and high quality to conduct education), "calculating" (calculating the gap between advanced furnaces and low-yield furnaces), and "checking and comparing" (holding on-site meetings for blast furnaces to check work enthusiasm and compare progress). This effectively broke down right-leaning conservative thinking and universally improved the ideological understanding of workers and staff, enabling them to actively invest in the iron and steel war. Throughout the movement, the following links were tightly grasped:

    First, at the beginning of each month, the prefectural Party committee separately convened telephone conferences for the industrial secretaries and heads of industrial and transportation departments of each county, as well as meetings for the Party committee secretaries and factory directors of the steel plants in Wuhu City. They deployed the monthly tasks, issued various technical and economic indicators for smelting on a monthly, ten-day, and daily basis, and made unified arrangements for the mining and transportation of ore and raw coal, as well as coking and transportation, so that they could be linked to blast furnace production to ensure the implementation of plans. Every day, each steel plant made a telephone report to the prefectural Party committee, and the prefectural Party committee directly grasped the output, coke ratio, and furnace conditions of each blast furnace. Regular meetings were held every Tuesday and Friday, with the participation of the heads of steel plants in Wuhu City, to check and compare the implementation of plans and exchange experiences. The ministers and deputy ministers of the industrial department frequently went to the factories to conduct roving inspections, and also sent cadres to be stationed in the factories to focus on helping with work and conducting investigations and research to summarize experiences. In this way, it was possible to grasp deeply, thoroughly, meticulously, and practically factory by factory, furnace by furnace, every ten days, and every day.

    Second, for the grassroots leading cadres of enterprises, while solving the problem of leadership ideology, help them improve their work style and methods, and achieve "one responsibility" (leading cadres take responsibility for areas and furnaces), "two followings" (following the production shifts, following the leadership shifts), and "five grasps" (grasping indicators, grasping progress, grasping ideology, grasping key points, and grasping the gap between advanced and backward). The vast majority of the factory leaders worked by the furnaces, and when they found problems, they studied them in a timely manner, so their understanding of the situation and the resolution of problems were more timely.

    Third, in the situation of wide distribution of blast furnaces, scattered ore production areas, and tight traffic and transportation, the work of scheduling and supplying raw materials and fuel was grasped tightly to ensure the high yield and high quality of small blast furnaces. To this end, the prefectural Party committee specially established a mining and transportation group to arrange the mining, scheduling, and transportation of raw materials and fuel by month, ten days, and day, as well as by fixed mine sites, fixed transportation tools, and fixed furnace groups. At the same time, on the transportation front, a red flag competition movement of "full load, fast loading, more towing, and less loss" was launched to continuously supply the small blast furnaces with grain and grass.

Boost Enthusiasm　Grasp Technology
    The large-scale bumper harvest of small blast furnaces in the Wuhu area is also the result of vigorously mobilizing the masses. The entire region, focusing on the central link of comprehensively increasing the utilization coefficient of small blast furnaces, has consistently used various political movements as a driving force, seizing favorable opportunities, constantly boosting enthusiasm, and organizing production upsurges. At the beginning of this year, through the implementation of the resolutions of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, a new atmosphere of "unremitting production before the Spring Festival and a full house of red after the Spring Festival" appeared. In February, after the prefectural Party committee convened the first industrial conference, the masses were mobilized to conduct thorough investigations and calculations, formulate leap forward plans, and launch a vigorous red flag competition movement of "ten comparisons." In April, through the convening of the second industrial conference of the prefectural Party committee, the masses were further mobilized to "work hard in April to welcome May Day," and through competition and evaluation, workers were mobilized to "work hard in red May, with a full house of red every day." In June, the masses were mobilized to "complete the second quarter plan ahead of schedule and overfulfill it to welcome July 1st." In July, by convening a five-level cadre meeting on industry, the method of airing views, debating issues, and rectifying work was used to promote the in-depth development of the production increase and savings movement. Since August, inspired by the great call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, a mass movement upsurge of "working hard in August and September to dedicate to the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country" has been launched through anti-rightism and boosting enthusiasm.
    While mobilizing the masses politically, the following major technical organization measures were grasped in terms of technical measures: "ore dressing before entering the furnace," "reducing coke consumption," and "promoting ten stable operations." In terms of ore dressing before entering the furnace, the "three selections" (rough selection at the factory, fine selection after crushing, and re-selection before entering the furnace) and the "two checkpoints" (weighing checkpoint and loading checkpoint) were summarized and promoted, so good ore was not missed, and waste rock did not pass the checkpoints. In terms of reducing coke consumption, workers were educated to "cherish coke as much as they cherish grain," and the crushing tools and operation methods were improved, so that the general coke crushing loss was reduced from 20-30% to 7-8%. Workers also spontaneously carried out coke and ore picking activities, saving a large amount of coke and increasing the production of pig iron.

    In order to maintain stable furnace conditions and increase pig iron production, the prefectural Party committee, based on the characteristics of small blast furnaces being small in size and responding quickly, summarized and promoted the "ten stable" operation method of No. 17 blast furnace of Yijiang Steel Plant, so that each small blast furnace could discover unstable factors in a timely manner and take measures to eliminate accidents before they occurred.

    In July, the high-temperature season arrived. At this stage, special emphasis was placed on equipment maintenance and repair. A classified ranking of equipment accidents in the first half of the year was conducted, the causes were studied, measures were formulated, and they were incorporated into safety technical operating procedures. Great attention was also paid to heatstroke prevention and cooling work. This effectively overcame the adverse effects of the high-temperature season on blast furnace production, creating favorable conditions for greater leaps forward in the next stage.

    In August and September, under the tremendous encouragement of the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, iron and steel production in the entire region entered a new upsurge. In this stage, the experience of large-air-volume operations such as "accelerating the speed of the blower and expanding the tuyere" was vigorously promoted. At the same time, Yijiang, Construction, and other steel plants explored and summarized the "single-unit double-room air supply" operation method, which achieved high temperature, large air volume, and enhanced smelting intensity.

    In recent months, a series of measures have been taken to ensure the steady rise of daily pig iron production.

Learn from the Advanced　Catch Up with the Advanced
    In the process of vigorously carrying out mass movements and improving the production of small blast furnaces, each factory started by comparing with the advanced, carried out advanced to bring the backward, and the backward to catch up with the advanced. They widely used methods such as looking (visiting in person), asking (interviewing), talking (holding discussions), proposing (asking questions and making suggestions), and expressing (expressing attitudes) to constantly check and compare whether the indicators were advanced, whether the measures were specific, whether the actions were rapid, whether the masses were mobilized deeply and thoroughly, and whether the effects were good. They encouraged each other, promoted each other, constantly narrowed the gap, and achieved universal improvement. Especially in August and September, the momentum of the mass movement was even greater, the mobilization was deep, the actions were fast, and factories and factories, workshops and workshops, furnaces and furnaces widely carried out counterpart checks, counterpart competitions, and set off a mass competition upsurge of you chasing me and learning from each other, so that advanced experience spread rapidly and bloomed everywhere. Whether in inter-factory or intra-factory competitions, it was a lively scene, with mutual visits and exchanges of experience. Each furnace and each factory selected equally matched fraternal factories as competition opponents. The workers' slogan was: "Learn from whoever is advanced." For example, after the workers of Construction Steel Plant heard that the utilization coefficient of their competition opponent, the Transportation Bureau Steel Plant, reached 1.592, they rushed to their plant overnight to learn. After returning to the factory, they immediately studied measures, and the average utilization coefficient of the blast furnaces in the plant increased to 1.606, exceeding the Transportation Bureau Steel Plant. The gap between the advanced and the backward was greatly reduced, the number of high-yield furnaces increased fourfold, and the number of low-yield furnaces decreased by more than 80%.

High Yield, High Quality, Low Cost
    Through the above efforts, the production level of small blast furnaces in Wuhu area rose sharply, rapidly leaping forward in the direction of high yield, high quality, and low cost. Comparing them season by season: The average daily output of pig iron was 416 tons in the first quarter, rose to 729 tons in the second quarter, and further rose to 859 tons in the third quarter. Among them, the average daily output in September was 1,175 tons, and it reached 1,649 tons on October 17. The average utilization coefficient of blast furnaces in the entire region was 0.817 in the first quarter, rose to 1.08 in the second quarter, and further rose to 1.222 in the third quarter. Among them, the average utilization coefficient in September was 1.435, and it reached 1.915 on October 17. The average coke ratio was 1.79 in the first quarter, decreased to 1.543 in the second quarter, and further decreased to 1.249 in the third quarter. Among them, it decreased to 1.101 in September, and to 0.899 on October 17. The quality of pig iron has always been maintained at a good level, with the qualified rate of pig iron reaching more than 95% in September, and even reaching 97% on October 17. The cost per ton of pig iron was also reduced in each quarter. In this way, the beautiful situation of large-scale bumper harvests of small blast furnaces in the entire prefecture appeared.

    After the iron and steel workers of Wuhu Prefecture greeted the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country with outstanding achievements, the prefectural Party committee, in the spirit of continuous revolution, issued a new battle call: Immediately increase the average utilization coefficient of small blast furnaces in the entire prefecture to 2 to 2.5 or more in the shortest possible time. In recent days, the vast number of workers in the entire prefecture have been in high spirits and full of enthusiasm. The output has been increasing again and again, the area of bumper harvests has become larger and larger, and advanced furnaces with a utilization coefficient of 2 or more have emerged in batches. Now, the workers of the entire prefecture are full of ambition and determined to fight together with the iron and steel workers of the whole country, through their own efforts and learning from the advanced experience of other regions, to complete and overfulfill this year's iron and steel production tasks ahead of schedule.

    小高炉红光满天
    ——介绍安徽省芜湖专区小高炉大面积丰产的经验
    大跃进　高速度
    芜湖专区处在安徽省的南部。这里矿藏极为丰富，但在大办钢铁运动以前，也和许多兄弟地区一样，还是钢铁工业的空白点，没有一座高炉，也没人懂得冶炼技术。在大跃进的1958年，全专区人民掀起了大办钢铁的群众运动，兴建了一批土炉与试验性的三立方米以下小高炉，初步掌握了炼铁技术之后，就集中力量分批突击建设小高炉。在“什么都没有，只有一双手，干劲加钻劲，铁水处处流”的口号下，各级党委书记亲自挂帅，工农商学兵从四面八方奔赴前线，为钢铁工业赶制设备，抢建高炉，开矿掘煤，建窑炼焦，运粮送草。群众描述当时的情况说：“芜湖城，沸腾腾，家家户户无闲人，千军万马齐上阵，一夜树起高炉群！”从去年8月到年底的短短四个月中，就建成了八立方米以上的小高炉一百八十座，总有效容积达到一千六百三十立方米。到1958年底，全区共生产好铁三万八千多吨。
    今年以来，全区小高炉生产在巩固、提高的基础上继续跃进。各炼铁单位广泛深入地发动职工群众，围绕以提高利用系数为中心，开展了优质、高产、低成本的大面积丰产的增产节约运动。目前，全区经常保持九十八座小高炉进行生产，利用系数平均达到一点九一五吨，其中有半数达到二至三以上。所产生铁也都符合炼钢、翻砂的质量要求。今年，全区可以超额70％完成国家计划，胜利实现年产三十多万吨生铁的计划指标，这比1949年全国产铁总和二十五万二千吨还要多五万多吨。同时，全区还拥有半数的备用炉。芜湖专区已经光荣地成为全国钢铁工业的炼铁基地之一。
    “大跃进，高速度”，这就是芜湖地区一年多来大办钢铁工业的总形势，这也是坚决贯彻执行党的总路线所获得的胜利。
    关键在于领导
    取得小高炉大面积丰产是有许多原因，但是，首要的关键在于领导。
    今年4月份，在大面积丰产运动开始时，首先遇到的问题是：炉况不稳定，事故较多，产量低，焦比高，部分干部对提高利用系数信心不足。有人说：“小高炉利用系数达到零点八就不错了”，有人说：“矿石不好，焦炭不够，要高产是心有余力不足”，有人说：“炉子旧了，要高产必须开新炉”，还有人认为：“南方雨水多，提高利用系数办不到……”。当芜湖市江南汽车厂小高炉的利用系数快达到二的时候，他们又说：“集中力量搞一两个炉子是可以的，普遍搞就有困难了”，等等。不扫除这些思想障碍，大面积丰产运动显然就难以开展。因此，在地委的直接领导下，首先发动群众运用了“学”（学八届六中全会决议与兄弟地区高产经验）、“教”（抓住条件同、质量高的先进炉进行教育）、“算”（算先进炉与低产炉的差距账）、“查比”（就高炉召开现场会议，查干劲、比先进）等虚实并举的方法，大破右倾保守思想，普遍提高了职工的思想认识，使他们积极地投入了钢铁大战。并在整个运动中，紧紧抓住了以下环节：
    第一，每个月初，地委分别召开各县工业书记、工业交通部长的电话会议和芜湖市各钢铁厂的党委书记、厂长会议，部署全月任务，按月、按旬、按日地下达各项冶炼技术经济指标，并对矿石、原煤的开采调运和炼焦、交通运输等作统一安排，使之与高炉生产能够互相衔接，做到计划落实。每天，各钢铁厂向地委作一次电话汇报，地委直接掌握每座高炉的产量、焦比和炉况。每星期二、五举行例会，由芜湖市各钢铁厂负责人参加，查比计划执行情况，交流经验。工业部的正副部长经常下厂，巡回检查，还派出干部驻厂，重点帮助工作和进行调查研究，总结经验。这样，就做到了厂厂、炉炉、旬旬、日日抓深、抓透、抓细、抓落实。
    第二，对企业基层领导干部，在解决领导思想问题的同时，帮助他们改进工作作风和工作方法，做到了“一包”（领导干部分片、分炉包干）、“二跟”（跟班生产、跟班领导）、“五抓”（抓指标、抓进度、抓思想、抓关键、抓先进与落后的差距）。各厂领导干部绝大部分都在炉边办公，发现问题，及时研究，因而对情况的了解和问题的解决都比较及时。
    第三，在高炉分布面广、矿石产区分散、交运通输紧张的情况下，抓紧原料燃料的调度供应工作，保证小高炉的高产，优质。为此，地委专门成立了矿石开采调运小组，把原料燃料的开采、调度、运输工作都按月、按旬、按日和定矿点、定交通工具、定炉群地进行了安排。同时在运输战线上，开展了“满载、快装、多拖、少损耗”的红旗竞赛运动，为小高炉源源供应粮草。
    鼓干劲　抓技术
    芜湖地区小高炉大面积丰产，又是大力发动群众的结果。全区围绕着全面提高小高炉利用系数这一中心环节，自始至终地运用各项政治运动作为动力，抓住有利时机，不断地鼓足干劲，组织生产高潮。今年年初，通过贯彻八届六中全会决议，出现了“春节前生产不松劲，春节后生产满堂红”的新气象。2月，在地委召开第一次工业会议以后，发动群众，摸底算账，制订跃进计划，轰轰烈烈地开展了“十比”红旗竞赛运动。4月，通过地委第二次工业会议的召开，又进一步发动群众“大干4月迎‘五一’”，并通过竞赛评比，动员职工“大干红5月，日日满堂红”。6月，发动群众“提前超额完成第二季度计划，迎接‘七一’”。7月，通过召开工业五级干部会议，运用鸣放整改的方法，促进了增产节约运动的深入开展。8月份以来，在党的八届八中全会的伟大号召鼓舞下，通过反右倾，鼓干劲，掀起了一个声势更为浩大的“大干8、9月，向建国十周年献礼”的群众运动高潮。
    在从政治上发动群众的同时，在技术措施上，抓住了“选矿入炉”、“降低焦炭损耗”、“推行十稳定操作”等几项重大的技术组织措施。在选矿入炉方面，总结推广了“三选”（进厂粗选、破碎细选、入炉前复选）和“两把关”（过磅关、上推关）制度，因此做到了好矿不漏掉，废石不过关。在降低焦炭损耗方面，对工人进行了“惜焦如惜粮”的教育，并且改进了破碎工具，改进了操作方法，使焦炭破碎损耗一般的都由20—30％降低到7—8％。职工们还自动地开展拾焦拾矿活动，节约了大批焦炭，增产了生铁。
    为了保持炉况稳定，增产生铁，地委根据小高炉体积小、反映快的特点，总结与推广了弋江钢铁厂十七号高炉的“十稳定”操作法，使各个小高炉都能够及时发现不稳定因素，采取措施，把事故消灭在发生之前。
    7月份，高温季节来临。这一阶段突出地抓住了设备维护检修，对上半年的设备事故进行了一次分类排队，研究原因，订出措施，纳入了安全技术操作规程；并且大抓防暑降温工作。这样就有力地克服了高温季节对高炉生产的不利影响，为下一阶段的更大跃进，创造了有利条件。
    8、9月份，在党的八届八中全会决议的巨大鼓舞下，全区炼铁生产又进入了一个新的高潮。在这一阶段里，大力推广了“加快风机转速，扩大风口”等大风量操作的经验，同时以弋江、建筑等铁厂摸索与总结出“单机双房送风”操作方法，达到了高温大风、强化冶炼强度的目的。
    几个月来，由于采取了一系列的措施，就保证了生铁日产量的稳步上升。
    学先进　赶先进
    在大搞群众运动、提高小高炉生产的过程中，各厂从比先进入手，开展先进带后进、后进赶先进，广泛地利用看（实地参观）、问（访问）、谈（座谈讨论）提（提问题、提建议）、表（表示态度）等方法，不断地查比指标是否先进，查比措施是否具体，查比行动是否迅速，查比群众是否发动深透，查比效果是否良好。互相鼓舞，互相促进，不断地缩小差距，达到普遍提高。特别是在8、9月份，群众运动的声势更为浩大，动员深，行动快，厂与厂、车间与车间、炉与炉之间广泛地开展了对口查比，对口竞赛，掀起了群众性的你追我赶、相互学习的竞赛热潮，使先进经验迅速传播，普遍开花结果。无论在厂际、厂内竞赛中，都热火朝天，相互串门，交流经验；各个炉、各个厂都选找势均力敌的兄弟厂作为竞赛对手，职工们的口号是：“哪里先进向哪里学”。如建筑铁厂职工在听说竞赛对手——交通局铁厂利用系数达到1.592以后，连夜赶到他们那里去学习，回厂后立即研究措施，全厂高炉平均利用系数提高到1.606，超过了交通局铁厂。先进与落后的差距大大缩小，高产炉上升了四倍，低产炉下降80％以上。
    高产　优质　低成本
    经过上述努力，芜湖全区小高炉生产水平扶摇直上，向着高产、优质、低成本的方向迅速跃进。以逐季对比：生铁平均日产量，第一季度为四百一十六吨，第二季度上升为七百二十九吨，第三季度再升为八百五十九吨，其中9月份的平均日产量为一千一百七十五吨，到10月17日则达到了一千六百四十九吨。全区高炉平均利用系数，第一季度为0.817，第二季度上升为1.08，第三季度再上升为1.222，其中9月份平均利用系数为1.435，到10月17日达到了1.915。平均焦比，第一季度为1.79，第二季度下降到1.543，第三季度又降到1.249，其中9月份降低到1.101，10月17日则降低到0.899。生铁质量，一直保持着较好的水平，9月份生铁合格率达到95％以上，10月17日更达到了97％。每吨生铁成本，也是每一季度都有所降低。这样，就出现了全专区小高炉大面积丰产的美好形势。
    芜湖专区钢铁职工以出色的成绩迎接了建国十周年以后，地委本着不断革命的精神，又发出新的战斗号召：立即在最短期间内，把全专区小高炉平均利用系数提高到2至2.5以上。连日以来，全专区广大职工更加意气风发，干劲冲天，产量一高再高，丰产面愈来愈大，利用系数在2以上的先进炉成批涌现出来。现在，全专区职工满怀壮志，决心通过自己的努力和学习其他地区的先进经验，和全国钢铁职工一起，为提前超额完成今年的钢铁生产任务而斗争。
