Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, November 20th: The official Bonn publication "Parliamentary Political News Bulletin" reported that, according to Bonn military sources, by the end of 1960, a missile base network comprising over sixty missile battalions will be established throughout Western Europe, according to plans from the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE). By 1963, Western Europe will have a total of one hundred missile battalions.

According to these sources, the United States has already established approximately thirty units of missile forces equipped with medium- and short-range missiles in Europe. SHAPE also plans that, within a "limited time," Western European NATO member states will establish approximately thirty-five missile battalions equipped with medium- and short-range missiles. These countries include West Germany, Denmark, France, Greece, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Italy, Norway, and Turkey.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 20th: The "Soviet Navy News" published a commentary today, exposing the United States' strengthening of West German arms production.

The commentary stated that since West Germany began playing an important role in NATO, West German military production has been continuously expanding, and stock prices in this area have skyrocketed. American capitalists are participating in West German military production by purchasing stocks and concluding agreements, eager to occupy a major position in West Germany's military industry.

The commentary concluded by emphasizing that American capital's intrusion into West German military production signifies a new stage in West German militarization. The events following the Treaty of Versailles and Hitler's rise to power are being repeated in a certain form. Arms dealers fear the elimination of the "Cold War," fearing that the improvement of the international situation will affect their profits. Therefore, they are strengthening their evil alliance behind the backs of the people.

    美国在西欧扩大导弹基地
    加强西德军火工业扶植西德军国主义
    新华社波恩20日电　波恩官方的“议会政治新闻公报”报道说，波恩军方人士透露，根据北大西洋集团最高司令部的计划，到1960年末要在整个西欧组成一个包括六十多个导弹营的导弹基地网。到1963年，西欧将共有一百个导弹营。
    据这些人士说，美国目前在欧洲已经建立了装备着中程和短程导弹的导弹部队大约三十个单位。北大西洋集团最高司令部还准备在一个“有限时间”内，由西欧各北大西洋集团成员国建立起大约三十五个装备着中程和短程导弹的导弹营。这些国家包括西德、丹麦、法国、希腊、英国、荷兰、意大利、挪威和土耳其。
    据新华社莫斯科20日电　“苏联海军报”今天发表一篇评论，揭露美国加强西德的军火生产。
    评论说，自从西德在北大西洋集团中开始起着重要作用以后，西德军事生产不断扩大，这方面的股票行情扶摇直上。美国资本家用购买股票、缔结协定等办法参加西德的军事生产，急于在西德的军事工业中占据主要阵地。
    评论最后强调说，美国资本侵入西德军事生产部门，意味着西德军国主义化走向一个新阶段。凡尔赛和约签订和希特勒执政后的事情以一定的形式在重复发生着。军火商们害怕消除“冷战”，害怕国际局势的改善会影响他们的利润。因此，他们正在背着人民加强罪恶的联盟。
