Nanning, November 12th (By our newspaper). Through the social organizational form of the people's commune, we will develop social productive forces at high speed, enable poor teams to quickly catch up with rich teams, poor societies to quickly catch up with rich societies, and minority ethnic mountainous areas to quickly catch up with advanced Han areas, eliminating de facto inequality in economic development between ethnic groups. This is the common goal of the people of all ethnic groups in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. At the recent on-site ethnic work conference held in Longsheng Various Nationalities Autonomous County, more than 100 ethnic work cadres and representatives of minority ethnic groups in mountainous areas unanimously expressed their determination to accelerate their progress towards this goal.

During the conference, the representatives visited several people's communes in Dayaoshan Yao Autonomous County and Longsheng Various Nationalities Autonomous County, as well as various advanced work projects in the two counties. They unanimously agreed that these two counties have set an example for various minority ethnic regions in catching up with advanced regions from backwardness and moving from poverty to prosperity. Under the leadership of the Party, the people of all ethnic groups in these two counties, holding high the red flags of the General Line and the people's commune, have transformed themselves from grain-deficient counties into grain-surplus counties through more than a year of arduous struggle. In 1958, Longsheng's total grain output reached 119 million jin, an increase of 58.6% compared to 1957, and about three times the highest output of 32 million jin before liberation. The county's 100,500 people had an average of more than 1,100 jin of grain per person. Last year, the total grain output of Dayaoshan also reached 20.09 million jin, an increase of 24% compared to 1957. In the past, these two counties had to rely on the transportation of 4 to 5 million jin of grain from other places every year. This year, they not only do not need supplies from other places, but also transfer more than 8 million jin of grain to other areas. On the basis of last year's Great Leap Forward, they continue to leap forward this year. At present, the intermediate rice in the two counties has generally achieved a bumper harvest. Since the Great Leap Forward, industry in the two counties has grown from scratch, ending the history of no industry in minority ethnic mountainous areas.

How were these achievements achieved? First, they took the General Line as the key link, adhered to putting politics in command, and continuously opposed right-leaning tendencies and boosted enthusiasm, which is the key to realizing the transformation from poverty to wealth. This year, when the Dayaoshan County Party Committee proposed the target of 1,700 jin of grain per person for the whole year, some people with right-leaning conservative ideas said: "The Yao Mountains are high and the water is cold, the fields are small and the land is steep. It is impossible to achieve this target." In order to criticize this right-leaning thought of "mountainous area exceptionalism," the whole Party and the whole people launched a great airing of views, a great contending of ideas, and a great debate. On the basis of improving the people's thinking, the County Party Committee proposed the battle cry of "If the West is not bright, the East will be bright; there is always one side where the sun shines," which was warmly supported by the vast number of cadres and masses. This year, the county expanded the planting of middle and late rice by a total of 4,852 mu; at the same time, it firmly grasped the key to vigorously attacking field management, making the late-season crops grow better than in any previous year. Longsheng County, through continuous struggle against regional "exceptionalism," broke superstitions, and people of all ethnic groups consciously changed various superstitious customs of taboo days and forbidden days, increasing the county's total labor days by 3.24 million days a year.

Second, launching mass movements to learn from the advanced, catch up with the advanced, and surpass the advanced, the great unity and great cooperation between societies, teams, and ethnic groups in the movement has been further expanded, giving full play to the superiority of the commune. The slogan "Learn from Sanjiang, Catch up with Sanjiang, and Surpass Sanjiang" was a tremendous force in Longsheng County's unprecedented bumper harvest of grain in 1958. This year, they have absorbed last year's experience and continued to carry out revolutionary friendship competitions with Sanjiang, Muping, Jingxi and other counties. At the same time, competition movements were also carried out between societies, brigades, production teams, and commune members. In the autumn harvest appraisal competition in September alone, 24 pace-setting brigades, 286 pace-setting production teams, and 3,631 individual pace-setters emerged in the county, increasing labor efficiency by 30% to 40%.

Third, "Grasping a thousand jin of grain in one hand and ten thousand treasures in the other" is an important measure here to change the face of the mountainous areas. Longsheng and Dayaoshan have good water conservancy conditions, abundant fertilizer sources, and lush forests and grasslands, with endless potential. The Party Committees at all levels in these two counties actively led the people of all ethnic groups to fight against unfavorable conditions and fully utilized favorable conditions, resulting in a situation of taking grain as the main focus and achieving comprehensive development and comprehensive leap forward. In addition to achieving a grain yield of 800 jin per mu last year, forestry in Dayaoshan also made great progress. Tens of thousands of people went to the mountains to carry out a shock afforestation, planting more than 270,000 mu of forest last winter and this spring. At the same time, they vigorously developed the old mountains, turning the ancient forests that had been dormant for thousands of years into useful materials.

After visiting and learning, the representatives were greatly encouraged by the great achievements and development prospects of socialist construction in the mountainous areas. Many representatives expressed at the meeting that they would be determined to learn from the advanced, catch up with the advanced, and surpass the advanced, and resolved to have poor teams catch up with rich teams, poor societies catch up with rich societies, and backward regions catch up with advanced regions in the shortest possible time.

    坚持政治挂帅　开展群众运动　一手抓千斤粮　一手抓万宝山
    龙胜大瑶两县走上富裕道路
    广西召开民族工作现场会议推广这一经验
    本报南宁12日电　通过人民公社这一社会组织形式，高速度发展社会生产力，使穷队迅速赶上富队，穷社迅速赶上富社，少数民族山区迅速赶上汉族的先进地区，消灭各民族间在经济发展方面事实上的不平等。这是广西僮族自治区各族人民的共同奋斗目标。最近在龙胜各族自治县举行的民族工作现场会议上，一百多名民族工作干部和山区少数民族的代表一致表示决心，向这一目标加速前进。
    会议期间，代表们参观了大瑶山瑶族自治县、龙胜各族自治县几个人民公社和两个县的各项先进工作后，一致认为这两个县在落后地区赶先进地区、和从贫穷走向富裕的道路上，为各少数民族地区树立了榜样。这两个县的各族人民，在党的领导下，高举着总路线和人民公社的红旗，经过一年多来的坚苦奋斗，已从缺粮县一跃而为余粮县。1958年，龙胜粮食总产量达一亿一千九百万斤，比1957年增长58.6％，较解放前最高产量三千二百万斤，增长三倍左右，全县十万零五千人，平均每人占有粮食一千一百多斤；去年大瑶山的粮食总产量也达到二千零九十万斤，比1957年增产24％。这两个县过去每年都要靠外地运进四、五百万斤粮食，今年不仅不需要外地供应，而且还外调八百多万斤粮食。在去年大跃进的基础上，今年仍继续跃进，目前，两个县的中稻普遍获得大丰收。大跃进以来两县工业从无到有，从小到大，结束了少数民族山区没有工业的历史。
    这些成绩是怎样得来的呢？第一、他们以总路线为纲，坚持政治挂帅，不断反右倾、鼓干劲，这是实现由穷变富的关键。今年大瑶县委提出全年每人占粮一千七百斤指标时，有右倾保守思想的人说：“瑶山山高水冷，田少地陡，实现这个指标办不到”。为了批判这种“山区特殊论”的右倾思想，全党全民展开了大鸣、大放、大辩论，在群众思想提高的基础上，县委又提出：“西方不亮东方亮，总有一方出太阳”的战斗号召，受到广大干部和群众的热烈拥护。今年全县仅中、晚稻共扩种四千八百五十二亩；同时，又紧紧抓住猛攻田间管理关，使晚造作物生长得比以前任何一年都好。龙胜县由于不断地向地区“特殊论”作斗争，破除了迷信，各族人民自觉地改变了种种忌日，禁日的迷信习俗，使全县一年共增加三百二十四万个劳动日。
    第二、开展学先进、赶先进、超先进的群众运动，运动中社与社、队与队之间，民族与民族之间的大团结、大协作更加扩大了，充分发挥了公社的优越性。“学三江、赶三江、超三江”的口号，是龙胜县1958年粮食获得空前大丰收的一个巨大力量。今年，他们又吸收去年的经验，继续与三江、睦边、靖西等县开展革命友谊竞赛，同时社与社、大队与大队、生产队与生产队、社员与社员之间也开展竞赛运动。仅9月间的秋收评比竞赛中，全县就涌现出二十四个标兵大队，二百八十六个标兵生产队，三千六百三十一名个人标兵，提高劳动效率30％到40％。
    第三、“一手抓千斤粮，一手抓万宝山”，是这里改变山区面貌的一项重要措施。龙胜和大瑶山，水利条件良好，肥源充足，林草茂盛，有无穷无尽的潜力。这两个县的各级中共党委，积极领导各族人民与不利条件作斗争，并充分利用了有利条件，因此，出现了一个以粮为主，全面发展、全面跃进的形势。大瑶山去年除了实现粮食亩产八百斤外，林业也有很大发展，几万人上山突击造林，去冬今春共造林二十七万多亩。同时，大力开发老山，使沉睡千年的古老森林变成有用之材。
    代表们经过参观学习，看到山区社会主义建设伟大成就和发展的远景，受到很大鼓舞。许多代表在会上表示，要立志学先进，赶先进，超先进，决心在最短时间内，穷队赶上富队，穷社赶上富社，落后的地区赶上先进的地区。
