    Beijing Fourth Construction Company Seizes Last Thirty-Odd Days
    Concentrates Efforts to Launch a Rush on Key Construction Projects

    (Our report) Having completed its annual production plan forty-four days ahead of schedule, the Beijing Fourth Construction Engineering Company has decided to fight another beautiful battle in the last thirty-odd days of the year.

    This company, due to the implementation of the policy of concentrating superior forces to fight a war of annihilation, the meticulous and solid technical management work done during the vigorous mass movement, and the leading cadres going deep into the work site to live, eat, and work alongside the workers, has enabled each project to be both fast and good, completing the annual infrastructure construction plan one and a half months ahead of schedule. Labor efficiency exceeded the quota by 30%, costs were reduced by 15.5% compared to the quota, the quality of construction was excellent in more than 95% of the projects, and no major safety accidents occurred.

    Recently, the company's Party committee, based on the soaring enthusiasm of the employees, promptly formulated new leap forward targets: striving to start construction on another 66,000 square meters before the end of the year, bringing the area under construction during the winter to 360,000 square meters, an increase of 80% over the same period last year; and ensuring that the quality of each project reaches first-class standards, striving to avoid any major safety accidents. The company's Party committee called on all employees to muster even greater efforts, overcome the severe cold and snow, break the convention that winter is the off-season for construction, carry out competitions, increase labor efficiency by 50% compared to the quota, and accomplish the work of three people with the efforts of two.

    The sixteen construction sites under the company's jurisdiction have successively held mobilization rallies, responding to the call of the company's Party committee, and have formulated leap forward plans and specific measures for the last month or so. These measures mainly include adhering to putting politics in command, launching a mass-based rapid construction movement while ensuring quality, and fighting a quick battle; in winter construction, continuing to implement the policy of concentrating superior forces on key projects in order to shorten the construction period and accelerate the turnover of heat preservation and heating equipment. Completing two projects with one set of equipment as much as possible; continuing to learn from the advanced experience of the Zhang Baifa Youth Commando Team, and promoting forty-five advanced experiences such as Yang Changshi's ladle-type mortar spreader and not using external scaffolding; leading cadres going deep into the work site to direct production, and solving problems in a timely manner; paying attention to ensuring project quality and safety, achieving a balance between work and rest, and actively carrying out employees' amateur cultural studies and improving employees' lives.

    The company has also decided to actively carry out training work in the next thirty-odd days, expand the manufacturing of prefabricated components, and create more favorable construction conditions for the continued leap forward next year.

    北京第四建筑公司抓紧最后三十几天
    集中力量突击修建重点工程
    本报讯　提前四十四天完成了全年生产计划的北京市第四建筑工程公司，决定在最后三十多天内，再打一个漂亮仗。
    这个公司由于贯彻执行了集中优势力量打歼灭战的方针，在轰轰烈烈的群众运动中，技术管理工作又做得十分细致、扎实，再加上领导干部深入现场，和工人同吃同住同劳动，因此，使每项工程做到既快又好，提前一个半月完成了全年基建计划。劳动效率超过定额30％，成本较定额降低15.5％，建筑质量95％以上优良，没有发生过一件重大的安全事故。
    最近这个公司的党委会根据职工们的冲天干劲，及时制订了新的跃进指标：力争在年底以前，再开工六万六千平方米，使冬季施工的建筑面积达到三十六万平方米，比去年同期增加80％；并且保证项项工程质量达到一级品，争取不发生一件重大的安全事故。公司党委号召全体职工鼓起更大干劲，战胜严寒风雪，打破冬季是施工淡季的常规，开展竞赛，使劳动效率比定额提高50％，做到两个人干三个人的活。
    这个公司所属的十六个工地，都先后召开了誓师大会，响应公司党委的号召，纷纷制订最后一个多月的跃进计划和具体措施。这些措施主要有坚持政治挂帅，在保证质量前提下，大搞群众性的快速施工运动，速战速决；在冬季施工中，继续贯彻执行集中优势兵力重点突击的方针，以便缩短工期，加快保温供热设备的周转。尽可能利用一套设备完成两项工程；继续开展学习张百发青年突击队的先进经验，推广杨长诗瓢式铺灰器、不搭外脚手等四十五项先进经验；领导干部深入现场指挥生产，发现问题，及时解决；注意保证工程质量和安全，做到有劳有逸，并且积极开展职工的业余文化学习，搞好职工生活。
    这个公司还决定在今后三十多天中，积极做好培训工作，扩大预制构件制造等工作，为明年的继续跃进创造更有利的施工条件。
