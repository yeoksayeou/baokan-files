Using the Least Time, Traveling the Shortest Mileage, Spending the Least Cost
Henan Province Achieves Straight-Line Transportation of Goods
Eliminating Five Thousand Circuitous Transfer Routes and Saving Sixty Million Yuan in Transportation and Miscellaneous Expenses in Just Over a Year

(Our report) Under the slogan of "Using the least time, traveling the shortest mileage, spending the least cost," Henan Province has achieved straight-line transportation of goods, greatly accelerating the circulation of commodities.

In the past, the commodity circulation channels in Henan Province were restricted by administrative divisions, generally requiring several links such as stations, secondary stations, county commercial bureau management departments, general stores, and retail stores. As a result, villages and towns close to transportation lines could not pick up and deliver goods directly nearby, resulting in considerable waste.

After the establishment of the People's Communes, the volume of goods purchased and sold in the vast rural areas increased unprecedentedly, with large quantities and tight deadlines, urgently requiring straight-line transportation. The people's commune system also created very favorable conditions for carrying out straight-line transportation. Under this new situation, the commercial departments of Henan Province greatly broke down conservative ideas and greatly changed unreasonable rules and regulations. From July of last year to September of this year, the province eliminated a total of 5,001 circuitous transfer routes, shortened the transportation mileage by 31,367 kilometers, eliminated one to four unnecessary circulation links, and reduced six to twelve procedures. Commodity transfers throughout the province have fully achieved straight-line transportation. In the past year or so, the implementation of straight-line transportation has saved a total of 60.48 million yuan in various transportation and miscellaneous expenses, which could be used to purchase more than 3,000 Liberation brand trucks.

Now, the transfer stations newly established by commercial departments in various places at stations and docks along the province's main transportation lines radiate directly to grassroots stores, production teams, public canteens, and government organizations like the rays of the sun. After completing the procedures, they can directly allocate and transfer large commodities such as coal, salt, fertilizer, pesticides, and machinery that they need to purchase, and large quantities of agricultural and sideline products such as cotton and local products that they need to sell, directly to the transfer stations. Remote mountainous areas and areas with poor transportation that cannot be reached in one trip have also set up distribution points or relay stations along the way, achieving long-distance direct delivery. Industrial and agricultural products produced and sold locally within the county have achieved direct contact between production and sales, with direct transportation from factories or direct transportation to factories.

    用最少时间　走最短里程　花最少费用
    河南全省实现商品直线运输
    一年多来去掉弯曲调运路线五千条，节省运杂费用六千万元
    本报讯　在“以最少时间，走最短里程，花最少费用”的口号下，河南省商品运输实现了直线运输化，大大加速了商品的流转。
    河南省商品流通渠道，过去受行政区划的限制，一般都要经过车站、二级站、县商业局管理部、综合商店、门市部等几层环节。这样，靠近交通沿线的村镇，不能就近直线取货，直线送货，造成了不少的浪费。
    人民公社成立以后，广大农村购进和出售的物品空前增加，数量大，时间紧，迫切要求直线运输。人民公社化也给开展直线运输创造了非常有利的条件。在这种新形势下，河南省商业部门大破保守思想，大改不合理的规章制度，从去年7月到今年9月，全省共砍去弯曲调运路线五千零一条，缩短运输里程三万一千三百六十七公里，省去不应有的流通环节一至四个，减少六至十二道手续。全省各地商品调运，已经全面实现了直线运输化。这一年多时间内，由于开展了直线运输，共节约各种运杂费等六千零四十八万元，用这笔钱可以购买解放牌汽车三千多辆。
    现在，各地商业部门在省内主要交通干线的车站码头新设立的中转站，像太阳的光芒一样，直接伸射到各基层商店、生产队、公共食堂和机关团体。它们需要购买的煤炭、食盐、化肥、农药、机械等大宗商品、和需要卖出的棉花、土产等大宗的农副产品等，在办过手续以后，就可以向中转站直拨直调。不能一次到达的边远山区和交通闭塞的地区，也在中途设立了分运点或接力站，实现了长途直达。县范围内就地产销的工农业产品，实现了产销见面，就厂直运或直运工厂。
