    Venezuela Prepares to Establish Unified Trade Union Organization
    Caracas News: Thirty thousand workers from Venezuela participated in the Third National Workers' Congress held on the 13th. The main agenda of the congress was to establish a unified Venezuelan trade union organization.
    Jose Gonzalez Navarro, a leader of the National Unified Trade Union and a deputy of the Democratic Action Party, said at the meeting that the principles followed by the new form of worker organization are trade union democracy and organizational unity. He said that so far, there are 685 trade unions and 1,250 peasant associations nationwide, belonging to 22 national industry organizations, with 1.1 million members. These organizations are the main foundation of this historic congress.
    Eloy Torres, a leader of the Venezuelan Unified Trade Union and a Communist Party deputy, said at the meeting that the convening of the Third Congress would bring the first stage of the worker solidarity movement that began in January 1958 to a climax. He said, "The workers have reached a high level of organization, and the working class and the peasant class are the basic factors in the struggle in Venezuela." He pointed out that it is necessary to carry out thorough land reform, fight against unemployment, develop the country's basic industries, and fight for a good oil contract.
    Colombian Agricultural Workers Demand Land Reform
    Bogota News: The first National Congress of Agricultural Workers of Colombia was held in Bogota from the 11th to the 13th. The congress adopted a program calling on urban and rural workers to unite and demanding land reform that gives land to the peasants.
    The congress called on the people to fight for peace, called for the establishment of a unified central trade union, for the establishment of a minimum wage in rural areas, and for the opening up of new international markets, especially socialist country markets, to defend the prices of agricultural products, and to revise contracts that damage national interests for purchasing surplus agricultural products from the United States.
    The congress also adopted a draft land reform bill, demanding the confiscation of land from unproductive large estates, especially those of American companies, prohibiting the continued leasing of oil-producing areas to imperialist companies, and transferring all these lands to agricultural workers.
