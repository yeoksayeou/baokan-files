Small Knowledge

    Willow Opera is one of the ancient opera genres in Shandong Province. It evolved from the "string music" system since the Yuan and Ming Dynasties. Its tunes are formed by combining popular folk tunes and ditties of the time, such as "Oriole," "Mountain Slope Sheep," and "Beating Date Rod," with the seven-character "Willow Tune." Because the Willow Tune is more popular and easier to understand, it is named Willow Opera. In the past, the opera circle had the saying "East Willow, West Bang, South Kun, North Yi," which shows that it had formed and had considerable influence before the Four Great Anhui Troupes entered Beijing and the Anhui opera rose during the reign of Emperor Qianlong in the late Qing Dynasty. Its popular range includes more than 30 counties bordering Shandong, Henan, and Jiangsu.
    In addition to the repertoires sung with folk tunes and melodies, such as "Sun An Moves the Capital," "The White Rabbit Tale," and "Holding a Makeup Box," this opera genre also absorbed Gaoqiang (such as "Zhang Fei Breaks into the Camp Gate," which is sung with a chorus and no orchestral accompaniment), Kunqu (such as "Meeting Brother at Mount Wutai," called Kun Tune Luan Tan), Luan Tan (namely Chuichang, such as "Beating Reed Flowers," etc.), Qingyang, Luoluo, Willow, and later Anhui Opera. There are more than 200 extant repertoires.
    The tunes are divided into Yue Tune, Ping Tune, Xia Tune, and Er Ba Tune. There are more than 200 melodic patterns, which are beautiful and pleasant to listen to. The accompanying musical instruments include the sanxian, sheng, and flute. Percussion instruments include single-skin drum, big gong, cymbals, and hand gong.
    Willow Opera not only preserves rich and colorful traditional repertoires and tunes, but also has its unique artistic style in terms of performing arts. In recent years, with the support of the Party, this ancient opera genre has been newly developed.

    柳子戏
    柳子戏是山东省的古老剧种之一。它是根据元、明以来“弦索”系统演变下来的，它的曲调是由当时流行民间的俗曲小令，如黄莺儿、山坡羊、打枣杆等，与七字句的“柳子调”结合而成。由于柳子调更为通俗易懂，因而命名为柳子戏。过去戏曲界曾有“东柳、西梆、南昆、北弋”的说法，可见在清乾隆末年四大徽班进京、徽调兴起以前，它已经形成，而且具有相当势力了。它流行范围包括山东、河南、江苏交界的三十余县。
    这个剧种除去用俗曲曲牌演唱的剧目，如“孙安动本”、“白兔记”、“抱妆盒”等以外，还吸收了高腔（如“张飞闯辕门”，唱时带帮腔，无管弦伴奏）、昆曲（如“五台山会兄”、称昆调乱弹）、乱弹（即吹腔，如“打芦花”等）、青阳、罗罗、柳子以及后来的徽调戏等，现存剧目有二百多出。
    曲调分为越调、平调、下调、二八调四种。曲牌共二百多支，优美动听。伴奏乐器有三弦、笙、笛。打击乐器有单皮、大锣、钹、手锣等。
    柳子戏不仅保存了丰富多采的传统剧目及曲牌，在表演艺术方面也有它独特的艺术风格。近年来在党的扶持下，这个古老的剧种得到了新的发展。
