Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 6th. TASS reports from Moscow: Moscow's various circles held a grand celebration rally today in the Lenin Central Stadium's Sports Palace to commemorate the 42nd anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution. The Sports Palace, with a capacity of 14,000, was filled with representatives from all walks of life.

The leaders of the Soviet Communist Party and the government were seated on the presidium.

A.B. Aristov, member of the Presidium and Secretary of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party, delivered a report at the celebration rally on the 42nd anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution.

In his report, Aristov emphasized that this great people's revolution was, in its essence, a constructive revolution. Life irrefutably proves that the Soviet people are realizing their plans through peaceful labor, rather than through war and expansion. He said:

"The socialist system does not need to be promoted and established by coercive means."

While elaborating on the achievements of the Soviet Union in 1959, Aristov pointed out that "things are going well," and the achievements of the Soviet Union reflect the fruitful results of restructuring the management of industry and construction, as initiated by the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party. In this regard, Aristov pointed out: "How short-sighted and detached from life was the anti-Party group that opposed the restructuring of production management! If the anti-Party group had not been exposed and crushed in time, how much harm would it have caused to the national economy!"

Aristov went on to point out that despite droughts in some regions, this year's harvest can still fully guarantee all domestic needs. The reporter pointed out that all the people recognize Khrushchev's special contribution to agricultural achievements.

Aristov then cited materials to prove the achievements made in the development of education, science, and technology in 1959. He said that the Soviet Union is ahead of other countries in exploring the universe. Aristov pointed out the great influence of the October Revolution on the entire course of world development. He said that all socialist countries in Europe and Asia are now smoothly building a new life. The working people of the socialist world system are advancing along the road to communism together with the Soviet Union.

He continued, thanks to the efforts of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, and all peace-loving forces, the international situation has significantly improved recently. The prospects for strengthening world peace are even better. The main reason is the growth of the strength and international influence of the Soviet Union and all socialist countries. He said: "The existence of the socialist world system is a powerful obstacle to the forces of aggression and war."

Aristov again emphasized that the Soviet Union consistently follows the Leninist principle of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems in its policies.

He believes that Khrushchev's visit to the United States was an extremely significant international event.

Aristov pointed out that the Soviet Union's plan for complete and thorough disarmament is highly humane and concrete. He said that this issue is the main and most pressing issue for mankind under the current conditions. He added: "We firmly believe that sound thinking will prevail sooner or later, and mankind will embark on the path of complete and thorough disarmament."

Aristov said that it will take a lot of effort and time to eliminate the consequences of the "Cold War." The struggle for lasting peace will be a long-term one. Aristov said that the Communist Party and the Soviet government "believe that their responsibility is to adhere to such a policy: from the relaxation of international tensions that has already been achieved to the complete elimination of tensions and the establishment of lasting world peace."

    向共产主义迈进　加强世界和平
    莫斯科举行十月革命节庆祝大会
    阿里斯托夫作了关于十月革命四十二周年的报告
    新华社6日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：莫斯科各界人士今天在列宁中央运动场体育宫举行了伟大的十月社会主义革命四十二周年的庆祝大会。在这个可以容纳一万四千人的体育宫中坐满了各界人士的代表。
    在会议主席台上就座的有苏联共产党和政府的领导人。
    苏联共产党中央委员会主席团委员、中央书记处书记阿里斯托夫在庆祝大会上作了关于伟大的十月社会主义革命四十二周年的报告。
    阿里斯托夫在报告中着重指出，这次伟大的人民革命就其本质来说是一次建设性的革命。生活无可辩驳地证明，苏联人民正在通过和平劳动、而不是通过战争和扩张的途径来实现自己的计划。他说：
  “社会主义制度不需要用强制手段来推行和确立。”
    阿里斯托夫在阐述1959年苏联的成就时指出，“事情进行得很好”，苏联的成就反映了根据苏共中央的倡议而进行的改组工业和建筑业管理的丰硕成果。在这方面，阿里斯托夫指出：“反对改组生产管理的反党集团是多么鼠目寸光和脱离生活，如果不是及时地揭露和粉碎了反党集团，它会给国民经济带来多大的危害。”
    阿里斯托夫接着指出，尽管一些地区天旱，但是，今年的收获还是可以完全保证国内的一切需要。报告人指出，全体人民公认赫鲁晓夫对农业成就有特殊的功绩。
    阿里斯托夫接着引证材料，来证明1959年在发展教育、科学和技术方面所取得的成就。他说，苏联在探索宇宙方面走在其他国家的前面。阿里斯托夫指出了十月革命对世界发展的整个进程的巨大影响。他说，现在欧洲和亚洲的所有社会主义国家正在顺利地建设新生活。社会主义世界体系各国的劳动人民正和苏联一道沿着通往共产主义的道路前进。
    他接着说，由于苏联和其他社会主义国家、一切爱好和平力量的努力，最近以来国际局势显著地好转了。加强世界和平的前景更加良好了。其主要原因是由于苏联和所有社会主义国家的实力和国际影响的增长。他说：“社会主义世界体系的存在对于侵略和战争势力来说是一个强有力的障碍”。
  阿里斯托夫再次着重指出，苏联在自己的政策中一贯遵循社会制度不同的国家共处的列宁主义原则。
    他认为赫鲁晓夫的访问美国是一个极其重大的国际事件。
    阿里斯托夫指出，苏联的全面和彻底裁军计划具有高度的人道性和具体性。他说，这个问题是人类在当前条件下的主要的和最迫切的问题。他补充说：“我们坚信，健康的思考迟早终将获胜，人类将走上全面彻底裁军的道路。”
    阿里斯托夫说，为了消除“冷战”的后果，还需要付出不少的力量和时间。争取持久和平的斗争将是长期的。阿里斯托夫说，共产党和苏联政府“认为自己的责任是坚持这样一个方针：从已经取得的国际紧张局势的缓和走到完全消除紧张局势、建立世界持久和平”。
