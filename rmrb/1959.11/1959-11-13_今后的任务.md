Editor's Note: At the National Congress of Heroes' advanced experience exchange meetings for the railway, transportation, and postal and telecommunications systems, Vice Minister of Railways Lü Zhengcao, Vice Minister of Communications Ma Huizhi, and Minister of Posts and Telecommunications Zhu Xuefan all gave speeches. The following is an excerpt of their speeches related to future tasks.

Vice Minister of Railways Lü Zhengcao: It can be said with certainty that it is entirely possible to complete this year's plan ahead of schedule and exceed the target.

Completing this year's plan one day earlier means stepping into 1960 one day earlier. Next year, we will not only actively complete the transportation tasks of industrial production, but also vigorously support the technical transformation of agricultural production, and regard the transportation for agricultural production and construction as a key task. Next year's transportation, road construction, and vehicle manufacturing tasks will all increase significantly compared to this year. Doing a good job in transportation at the beginning of next year and during the Spring Festival is one of the keys to next year's Great Leap Forward.

To complete the tasks for the last two months of this year and the first quarter of next year, we must fight against the severe cold. The colder the weather, the higher our enthusiasm must be. With high enthusiasm, the cold wind can be driven away, and ice and snow can be melted. We must have this kind of energy.

How to do it? First, we must thoroughly criticize right-leaning ideas, boost our morale, and resolutely implement the general line. Second, we must carry out red flag emulation campaigns and take advantage of the momentum of the Heroes' Congress to universally promote all advanced experiences without omission. Third, we must vigorously carry out technical innovation and technical revolution. Fourth, we must vigorously promote cooperation and achieve a common leap forward.

The current focus of the technical revolution is, first, to master the application and maintenance technology of friendly locomotives; second, to tame both indigenous and foreign hump yards; third, to vigorously promote mechanization and semi-mechanization of track maintenance, loading and unloading, and construction; and also to develop high and low cargo platforms and improve communication signal equipment.

Further strengthening cooperation between the railway and other sectors can also tap great potential. Currently, the running time accounts for 44.8% of the total vehicle turnaround time. If we can increase this by another 5%, it would be equivalent to adding 10,000 operational vehicles. As long as everyone works hard, this is entirely achievable.

Vice Minister of Communications Ma Huizhi: Our current task is to carry out the mass movement more comprehensively, widely, and deeply to ensure the early completion of production and construction tasks and the continued leap forward of industrial and agricultural production next year. To this end, all employees are required, with the strong support of the broad masses of rural people, to complete the 1959 transportation plan ahead of schedule and exceeding the target. We must ensure both the quantity and quality of transportation; we must grasp both the current transportation production and transportation infrastructure construction; we must complete this year's transportation tasks ahead of schedule and exceeding the target, and also make all preparations for the transportation work in the first quarter of next year. We must take a two-pronged approach, work simultaneously, and complete this glorious and arduous task with firm confidence.

In terms of highways, we should continue to carry out the labor competition of "safety, economy, and 10,000 ton-kilometers per vehicle-ton per month," and promote the fifteen proposals put forward by highway advanced collective representatives and advanced producer Comrade Xiao Peijun and 130 others.

Currently, the greatest transportation potential lies in waterway transportation, especially inland river wooden sailing ship transportation. Wherever there are rivers that can be utilized, the role of waterway transportation should be fully leveraged. And the key to fully leveraging the role of waterway transportation lies in strengthening port loading and unloading capabilities and implementing small horsepower tugboats to tow wooden sailing ships.

In terms of civil aviation, we should continue to deeply carry out the "Six Goods" red flag emulation campaign with safe flight as the guiding principle.

In terms of short-distance transportation, we should fully implement the "Instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on Carrying Out the Mass Short-Distance Transportation Movement," establish and consolidate professional transportation teams, implement planned transportation, and while establishing and consolidating professional transportation teams, vigorously carry out technical innovation, vigorously build short-distance transportation networks, increase transportation tools, improve transportation efficiency, and save labor. We must continuously develop the already formed high tide of the mass movement.

Minister of Posts and Telecommunications Zhu Xuefan: Postal and telecommunications are a powerful tool for the people of the whole country to implement the Party's general line and realize the continued leap forward of the national economy. Comrade Zhu De pointed out in his congratulatory message to the Heroes' Congress on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China: "We must realize the technical transformation of agriculture in our country as soon as possible, that is, to realize the mechanization, water conservancy, chemicalization, and electrification of agriculture." This is a major task for the people of our country at the present stage. Therefore, we must put ensuring the communication needs of agricultural leap forward in an important position, continue to carry forward the role of communication soldiers in the agricultural leap forward, and adapt to the needs of agricultural technical transformation. Under the situation of the continued leap forward in the cause of national socialist construction, we must not only guarantee the ever-increasing communication needs in terms of quantity, but also improve services, strengthen management, and guarantee in terms of quality, so that postal and telecommunications can be faster, more accurate, safer, and more convenient.

### 今后的任务

    今后的任务
    编者按：在全国群英会铁路、交通、邮电系统三个先进经验交流会议上，铁道部吕正操副部长、交通部马辉之副部长、邮电部朱学范部长都讲了话。这里摘要发表的是他们的讲话中有关今后任务的部分。
    铁道部副部长吕正操：可以肯定地说，提前和超额完成今年的计划是完全可以做到的。
    早一天完成今年计划，也就是早一天跨入1960年。明年不但要积极完成工业生产的运输任务，还要大力支援农业生产的技术改造，把农业生产建设的运输，作为一个重点任务。明年的运输、修路和造车任务，都将比今年有很大的增长。搞好明年年初和春节的运输，是明年跃进的关键之一。
    完成今年最后两个月和明年第一季度的任务，我们要和严寒作斗争。天气越冷，我们的热气要越高。热气高了，寒风可以驱走，冰雪可以溶化。要有这种劲头。
    怎么干呢？第一、要把右倾反透，干劲鼓足，坚决贯彻执行总路线。第二、要开展红旗竞赛，要趁群英大会的声势，把所有先进经验一个不漏地普遍推广起来。第三、要大搞技术革新和技术革命。第四、要大搞协作，共同跃进。
    当前技术革命的重点，一是掌握友好型机车的运用和检修技术，二是驯服土洋两驼峰，三是大搞养路、装卸、施工机械化半机械化，还要发展高低货位，改善通讯信号设备。
    进一步加强路内外协作，还可以挖掘很大潜力。现在，在车辆总周转时间中，运行时间占44.8％，如果再提高5％，就可以相当于增加一万辆运用车。只要大家努力，这是完全可以做到的。
    交通部副部长马辉之：当前我们的任务，就是要把群众运动更全面、广泛、深入地开展下去，保证生产建设任务的提前完成和明年工农业生产的继续跃进。为此，要求全体职工，在广大农村群众的有力支援下，提前和超额完成1959年的运输计划。既要保证运输数量，又要保证运输质量；既要抓当前的运输生产，又要抓交通基本建设；既要提前和超额完成今年的运输任务，又要为明年第一季度的运输工作做好一切准备。双管齐下，同时并举，以坚强的信心来完成这个光荣而艰巨的任务。
    公路方面，应继续开展“安全、节约、车吨月产万吨公里”的劳动竞赛，推广公路先进集体代表和先进生产者萧培俊同志等一百三十一人提出的十五条倡议。
    目前运输潜力最大的是水路运输，特别是内河木帆运输。凡有河流可以利用的地方，应当充分发挥水路运输的作用。而充分发挥水路运输的作用，关键在于加强港口装卸力量和实行小马力拖轮，拖带木帆船。
    民航方面，应继续深入开展以安全飞行为纲的“六好”红旗竞赛。
    短途运输方面，应全面贯彻中共中央、国务院“关于开展群众短途运输运动的指示”，建立并巩固专业运输队伍，实行有计划的运输，在建立和巩固专业运输队的同时，大搞技术革新，大力建设短途运输网，增加运输工具，提高运输效率，节约使用劳动力。把目前已经形成的群众运动的高潮，持续不断地向前发展。
    邮电部部长朱学范：邮电通信是全国人民贯彻党的总路线、实现国民经济继续跃进的有力工具。朱德同志代表中共中央向群英大会的祝词中指出：“我们要尽快地实现我国的农业技术改造，就是说使农业实现机械化、水利化、化学化和电气化。”这是我国人民现阶段的重大任务。因此，我们必须把保证农业跃进的通信需要，放在重要的地位上，继续发扬在农业跃进中通信兵的作用，以适应农业技术改造的需要。在国家社会主义建设事业继续跃进的形势下，我们不仅要从数量上来保证日益增长的通信需要，而且要改善服务，加强管理，从质量上来保证，使邮电通信做到更加迅速、准确，更加安全、方便。
