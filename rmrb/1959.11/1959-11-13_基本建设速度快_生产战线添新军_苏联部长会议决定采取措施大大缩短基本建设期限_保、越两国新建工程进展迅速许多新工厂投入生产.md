Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Moscow: TASS reports: The Soviet Council of Ministers recently passed a resolution on accelerating basic construction. The resolution stipulates measures to accelerate the commissioning of new production capacity. The resolution stipulates increasing the new production capacity put into operation in the Soviet Union in 1960 and shortening the basic construction period to the greatest extent. The resolution requires organizing the public to supervise the timely completion of basic construction and the commissioning of production capacity in various places.

Before passing this resolution, the Soviet Council of Ministers heard a report by Soviet Deputy Prime Minister Kosygin on the completion of basic construction in the Soviet Union in 1959 and the commissioning of production capacity.

The Soviet Council of Ministers also passed a draft of the principles of Soviet land use law. The purpose of formulating this draft is to more rationally utilize the country's land resources. The draft stipulates giving the constituent republics broader rights in solving land issues, and clearly stipulates the rights and obligations of land users—collective farms, state farms, industrial enterprises, and other units, as well as individual citizens.

This draft will be submitted to the Soviet Supreme Soviet for discussion.

Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Sofia: Bulgaria has continuously achieved new successes on the basic construction front. Recently, good news about the commissioning of new factories and enterprises and the start of construction has been constantly coming from all over the country.

The first phase of the new rolling mill of Bulgaria's largest steel enterprise, the Lenin Metallurgical Plant, has been put into operation three months ahead of schedule. Now, the Bulgarian people not only have their own steel and iron production, but also their own steel plate production. The construction and installation workers of this rolling mill proposed a guarantee to complete the second phase of the project more than forty days ahead of schedule.

The construction of the fifth open hearth furnace of the Lenin Metallurgical Plant started on October 18. The workers confidently proposed that the open hearth furnace should produce steel in two and a half months.

The expansion project of the Stalin Chemical Fertilizer Plant was also completed one month ahead of schedule recently. After the expansion, the factory's annual nitrogen fertilizer production doubled compared with last year, reaching 240,000 tons. Now, the factory's three-month nitrogen fertilizer production is equivalent to the entire year's production in 1952.

At the same time, in the Stara Zagora region, a modern nitrogen fertilizer factory with an annual output of 440,000 tons of chemical fertilizer started construction on October 19. This factory will be completed in early 1964. Its equipment capacity is twice that of the Stalin Chemical Fertilizer Plant.

Recently, a new force has been added to the ranks of Bulgarian sugar production. In the city of Lom in the Vratsa region, a new sugar factory was put into operation one year ahead of schedule. This factory can process 1,500 tons of sugar beets per day and produce 150 tons of sugar.

At present, the staff and workers of the construction and installation departments are advancing victoriously, and they want to put nineteen new and expanded industrial basic construction projects that started construction this year into operation more than one month ahead of schedule.

Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Hanoi: According to local newspaper reports: Bui Quang Tao, Minister of Construction of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, pointed out in an article recently written for the Vietnam News Agency that Vietnam has completed 80% of the annual plan for basic construction and installation work in the first ten months of this year; the amount of construction completed in these ten months has doubled compared to the entire year of 1958.

The article said that so far, hundreds of industrial enterprises and civil construction projects distributed in the plains and coastal areas of northern Vietnam have been completed or basically completed. Many industrial enterprises, such as the An My rice mill in Viet Tri, the Hanoi stationery factory, the Haiphong enamel factory, the Haiphong plastic products factory, the Nghe An sawmill, and the Luong An water plant, have been put into operation. Civil construction projects, such as professional schools and university school buildings, residential areas, and warehouses, are already available for use. Others, such as sugar factories, paper mills, soap factories, cigarette factories, rubber factories, dry battery factories, and storage battery factories, are under rapid construction.

The article emphasized that due to the completion of many new factories, not only have more daily necessities been produced, further meeting the people's needs for housing, water, electricity, and stationery, but also the state's investment in infrastructure projects has been put into play in a timely manner, further solving the employment problem of workers and laborers; at the same time, it has also created many new socialist material foundations for the North, which has also played a positive role in the struggle to achieve a unified country.

    苏联部长会议决定采取措施大大缩短基本建设期限
    保、越两国新建工程进展迅速许多新工厂投入生产
    新华社讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联部长会议最近通过了一项关于加速基本建设的决议。决议规定了使新的生产能力加速投入生产的措施。决议规定增加苏联在1960年投入生产的新生产能力并且最大限度地缩短基本建设期限。决议要求组织公众对各地及时完成基本建设和使生产能力投入生产的任务的情况进行监督。
    在通过这项决议以前，苏联部长会议听取了苏联部长会议副主席柯西金作的关于苏联完成1959年基本建设和使生产能力投入生产的情况的报告。
    苏联部长会议还通过了苏联土地使用法原则草案。制定这个草案的目的是为了更合理地利用全国的土地资源。草案规定给予各加盟共和国在解决土地问题方面更广泛的权利，并且明确规定了土地使用者——集体农庄，国营农场，工业企业和其他单位以及公民个人的权利和义务。
    这项草案将提交苏联最高苏维埃讨论。
    新华社索非亚电　保加利亚基本建设战线上不断取得新的成就，最近，新的工厂和企业投入生产和开工兴建的喜讯不断从全国各地传来。
    保加利亚全国最大的钢铁企业——列宁冶金工厂新建的轧钢厂第一期工程已经提前三个月投入生产。现在，保加利亚人民不仅有了自己生产的钢和铁，而且有了自己生产的钢板。这座轧钢厂的建筑和安装工人们提出保证，要提前四十多天完成第二期工程。
    列宁冶金工厂的第五个平炉的修建工程已在10月18日动工。工人们信心百倍地提出，两个半月后，要让这座平炉出钢。
    斯大林化学肥料工厂的扩建工程，也在最近提前一个月竣工。这个工厂扩大后，氮肥年产量比去年增加了一倍，达二十四万吨。现在，这个工厂三个月的氮肥产量，就相当于1952年全年的产量。
    与此同时，在斯塔拉萨哥拉州，一座年产四十四万吨化学肥料的现代化氮肥工厂已于10月19日动工兴建。这个工厂将于1964年初建成。它的设备能力，相当于斯大林化肥厂的两倍。
    在保加利亚砂糖生产行列里，最近又增添了一支新的生力军。在弗拉查州的罗姆市，最近有一座新制糖厂提前一年投入生产。这座工厂每昼夜能加工一千五百吨甜菜，制出一百五十吨砂糖。
    目前，建筑和安装部门的职工们正在乘胜前进，要使今年开始施工的十九个新建和扩建的工业基本建设工程提前一个月以上投入生产。
    新华社河内电　据此间报纸报道：越南民主共和国建筑部长裴光造在最近为越南通讯社撰写的一篇文章中指出，越南在今年头十个月中已经完成基本建设和安装工作全年计划的80％；在这十个月中建成的工程量比1958年全年增加了一倍。
    文章说，到目前为止，分布在越南北方平原和沿海地区的成百个工业企业和民用建筑工程已经建成或基本建成。很多工业企业，如越池的安美碾米厂、河内文教用品厂、海防搪瓷厂、海防塑料制品厂、宜安锯木厂和良安自来水厂等已经投入生产。民用建筑工程，如各专业学校和大学校舍、住宅区以及仓库等已经可以使用。其它如糖厂、纸厂、肥皂厂、卷烟厂、橡胶厂、干电池厂和蓄电池厂等则正在迅速建设中。
    文章着重指出，由于许多新工厂的建成，不但生产了更多的日用品，进一步满足了人民对住宅、水、电和文教用品等方面的需求，而且及时发挥了国家在基建工程中投资的作用，进一步解决了工人和劳动者的就业问题；同时，还为北方创造了许多新的社会主义的物质基础，对实现统一国家的斗争也起了积极的作用。
