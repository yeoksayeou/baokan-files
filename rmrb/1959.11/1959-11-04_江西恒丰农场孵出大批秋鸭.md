	Jiangxi Hengfeng Farm Hatches a Large Number of Autumn Ducklings
	In order to rapidly develop poultry production, the state-owned Hengfeng Farm in Jiangxi Province has hatched a large number of autumn ducklings.
	This farm established a hatchery this spring and has been hatching poultry in large quantities. On the basis of 1,200 ducks last year, the entire farm increased to 19,388 ducks in the spring and summer seasons, an increase of 15.3 times compared with last year.
	In order to break the past phenomenon of increasing poultry production one year and decreasing the next, the farm is actively hatching autumn ducklings. Up to now, 7,345 ducklings have been hatched, with a hatching rate of over 80%. After the last two batches are hatched, the number of ducklings will reach 10,345. By the spring and summer seasons next year, there will be a large number of fat ducks and fresh eggs for sale.
	Young ducklings are best fed with live food (maggots) in their early stages, but the weather is cool in autumn and maggots are scarce. The duck herders go to shallow ponds, lakes and marshes to catch small fish, shrimps and other aquatic animals as feed, so that the ducklings grow quickly and have a high survival rate.

    江西恒丰农场孵出大批秋鸭
    江西省国营恒丰农场为了迅速发展家禽生产，孵出大批秋鸭。
    这个农场今春建立了孵房，大量孵家禽。全场在去年一千二百只鸭子的基础上，春夏两季就跃增到一万九千三百八十八只，较去年增长十五点三倍。
    该场为了打破以往家禽生产上上年增加下年下降的现象，积极孵养秋鸭。到目前为止，已孵出雏鸭七千三百四十五只，孵化率达80％以上。等最后两批孵出后，雏鸭将达到一万零三百四十五只。到明年春夏两季，就有大批肥鸭和鲜蛋出售。
    小鸭幼期以吃活食（粪蛆）为宜，但秋天天气凉，粪蛆缺乏，牧鸭工人就到浅水池塘、湖沼捕取小鱼虾等水生小动物作饲料，使小鸭生长快、成活率高。（黄祖荣）
