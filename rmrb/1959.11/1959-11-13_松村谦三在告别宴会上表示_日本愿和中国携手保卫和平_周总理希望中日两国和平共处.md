　　Matsumura Kenzo held a farewell banquet in Beijing tonight to entertain people from all walks of life in our country. Mr. Matsumura Kenzo delivered a speech at the banquet, stating that Japan is willing to join hands with China. He said that although Japan and China have different political systems, as members of Asia, Japan is willing to treat all Asian nations equally and reciprocally in order to seek common prosperity, and rely on this strength to defend world peace. Therefore, we are willing to join hands with China to strive for the realization of this ideal.

　　Premier Zhou Enlai was invited to attend the banquet and delivered a speech at the banquet.

　　Mr. Matsumura Kenzo first delivered a speech at the banquet, saying that we have been visiting China for more than 20 days at the invitation of Premier Zhou Enlai. During this period, we have received very warm hospitality. Premier Zhou and all the gentlemen took time out of their busy schedules to exchange views with us on issues related to Sino-Japanese relations, which we are very grateful for. After expressing his farewell, Matsumura Kenzo expressed his gratitude to Premier Zhou and people from all walks of life for attending today's banquet.

　　Matsumura Kenzo said that during our visit to China, we deeply felt that in another five or ten years, all the mountains in China will be covered with green clothes, the rivers will become clear, and people's lives will definitely be greatly improved. During this period, Chinese culture will also blossom with unique flowers. In short, we feel that China is creating something completely new, so I would like to express my congratulations to everyone. He also said that I would like to live five or ten years longer so that I can visit China again and see China's great achievements.

　　Matsumura Kenzo said that the Chinese people are enthusiastically building their own country, and we are willing to learn from China and build Japan into a peaceful, new country where people live in peace and have culture. To this end, we will do our best.

　　He said: We believe that although Asian countries have achieved independence, they are still quite poor and weak due to long-term exploitation. I hope that the construction of the Chinese people can become an example for these countries.

　　Matsumura Kenzo emphasized: We Japanese are willing to join hands with China. Although our two countries have different political systems, as members of Asia, we are willing to treat all Asian nations equally and reciprocally in order to seek common prosperity, and rely on this strength to defend world peace. Therefore, we are willing to join hands with China to strive for the realization of this ideal. He said that we have received warm hospitality during this visit to China, and we hope that this visit can contribute to the mutual exchanges between Asian countries.

　　Matsumura Kenzo said: We will be leaving tomorrow, but we hope that all the gentlemen can give us as much care as during this visit in the future, which can enhance the friendly relations between Japan and China. Matsumura Kenzo finally proposed a toast to the health of Premier Zhou Enlai, to the future development of China, and to the efforts to realize the friendship and goodwill between Japan and China.

　　Premier Zhou Enlai spoke at the banquet. He said that he thanked Mr. Matsumura Kenzo for holding a farewell banquet to entertain us, and thanked Mr. Matsumura Kenzo for his praise and congratulations to China at yesterday's and today's banquets.

　　Premier Zhou Enlai said that China's construction has made some achievements, but it is still far from enough, and we must continue to work hard. We also hope that after the continued efforts of the Chinese people, in five or ten years, when Mr. Matsumura Kenzo comes to China again, he can see more achievements made by the Chinese people.

　　Premier Zhou Enlai said that we are also willing to see the people of China and Japan join hands under the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and continue to work together for the peaceful coexistence of China and Japan, for the friendly exchanges between the people of China and Japan, and for the improvement of relations between China and Japan.

　　We also hope that Asian countries will seek independent development of their respective national economies on the basis of the Ten Principles of the Bandung Conference, and at the same time, seek common economic development of all countries based on the principle of equality and mutual benefit.

　　Premier Zhou Enlai finally proposed a toast to the health and smooth journey of Mr. Matsumura Kenzo and his entourage, and to the friendly exchanges and peaceful coexistence between the people of China and Japan.

　　The heads of relevant departments, people's organizations, and people from all walks of life who were invited to attend the banquet included: Guo Moruo, Liao Chengzhi, Liu Ningyi, Cai Tingkai, Zhang Hanfu, Li Zhuchen, Nan Hanchen, Chu Tunan, Xu Guangping, Wang Kunlun, Lian Guan, Wu Kejian, Li Jiebo, Zhao Puchu, Mei Lanfang, Ji Chaoding, Wu Maosun, Zhou Peiyuan, Shen Zijiu, Xie Bingxin, Xie Nanguang, Zhao Anbo, Peng Yan, Sun Pinghua, Ding Tuo, etc.

　　Japanese peace activist Kinkazu Saionji, who was in Beijing, also attended the banquet.
