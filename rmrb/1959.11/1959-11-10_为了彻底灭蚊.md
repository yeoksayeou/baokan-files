    To Completely Eradicate Mosquitoes
    One evening, outside a mountain village, a Soviet comrade sat by a stream, stripped to the waist. One o'clock, two o'clock, three o'clock... He sat there quietly. This area was a high mountain region in the Viet Bac Autonomous Region where malignant malaria was most severe. Malaria-carrying mosquitoes swarmed, tormenting the local high mountain ethnic residents like demons.
    Mosquitoes covered the Soviet comrade's skin. He was itchy all over, and some areas were already swollen from the bites. But his hope was to attract more mosquitoes to his bare upper body. By the light, he carefully observed the mosquitoes' biting posture, and then gently patted them, collecting the half-dead mosquitoes. These were to be used for the classification and study of malaria-carrying mosquitoes. Finally, he felt satisfied. By the time he put his shirt back on, it was already three in the morning.
    When the local people talked about Comrade Bularnikov, the head of the Soviet anti-malaria expert team, they were filled with gratitude and respect. Stories about his selfless work and the work of a group of Soviet experts working with him, and their ability to connect with the high mountain ethnic residents, have spread widely in the Viet Bac Autonomous Region. What force supports their selfless spirit of service? It is a firm determination to help the Vietnamese people eradicate the most rampant disease that has tormented them for generations as soon as possible. Under the cruel exploitation and obscurantist policies of the French colonialists, according to surveys, out of the more than 13 million people north of the 17th parallel in Vietnam, more than 5 million had suffered from or had malaria before liberation. In the Viet Bac Autonomous Region, out of 1.16 million people, the vast majority had suffered from or had the disease. According to a survey conducted by Soviet experts in several areas of the autonomous region where malaria was most severe, the majority of malaria here was malignant malaria caused by falciparum malaria parasites. It often causes liver lesions and abdominal edema, and the mortality rate of patients is very high. In Khe Pai Township, Ha Giang Province, 46% of the population suffered from abdominal edema. In some townships in Lang Son Province, the rate of people suffering from this disease reached over 50%. In areas where the disease was severe, it was common to see entire families die. In the Fenmi mining area and Luo Yan Town, there were hardly any children to be seen on the streets. The people of Daci County composed many painful folk songs about malaria, one of which said: "Here, there is birth without nurture, and what remains are only dispirited people." The Yao and Miao ethnic groups in the high mountain areas suffered even more severely from malaria. Before liberation, the Yao population declined sharply. Only seven Miao people remained in the entire province of Thai Nguyen.
    With the help of another Soviet expert, Comrade Lysenko, the Vietnamese government has already formulated a preliminary plan for nationwide malaria eradication last year. It is planned to basically eliminate malaria in the Vietnamese territory north of the 17th parallel in about five years. Pilot work began last year in Thai Nguyen Province. Anti-malaria mobilization rallies were held in all provinces and counties of the Viet Bac Autonomous Region, and Soviet experts often personally attended and spoke at the rallies. Anti-malaria committees were established at all levels in provinces, counties, and townships. Soviet experts also trained hundreds of anti-malaria medical personnel in a short period. In more than a year, more than 100 tons of mosquito repellent (DDT calculated as powder) have been sprayed in the Viet Bac Autonomous Region (with a focus on Thai Nguyen Province), and more than 2.53 million quinine tablets have been distributed. The Vietnamese government has also begun to promote mosquito prevention measures such as digging ditches, filling pits, and plugging tree holes.
    After more than a year of efforts, the density of malaria-carrying mosquitoes and the incidence of the disease among the people have decreased significantly. Many children and adults with sallow complexions and swollen abdomens have gradually become rosy-cheeked and their abdomens have become less swollen. Many families that used to rely on the help of People's Liberation Army soldiers and commanders during the busy farming season are now able to work in the fields themselves. The Yao population has begun to increase. When mothers hold their sweetly sleeping children who no longer cry due to abdominal illness, they have indescribable feelings. Some high mountain ethnic groups who do not yet have a written language have also asked others to write many letters to Soviet experts and President Ho Chi Minh, expressing their unparalleled joy and gratitude. These high mountain ethnic groups were initially afraid to approach the Soviet experts because they were foreigners. When the Soviet experts were about to leave, people of all ages, both men and women, were reluctant to let them go. They said, "Soviet experts are relatives," and insisted that the experts accept their gifts.
    The Soviet experts have been gone from the Viet Bac Autonomous Region for some time, but the large number of anti-malaria medical personnel they trained are continuing to guide the autonomous region's malaria eradication campaign under the leadership of the local Party and government. Soviet expert Lysenko maintains communication with them by mail every month. Recently, the medical personnel of the autonomous region received a letter from Comrade Lysenko from the Soviet Union, saying that he would come to the autonomous region again in November to work with them, and everyone was very excited. They said that with a nationwide malaria eradication campaign, coupled with the close assistance and guidance of Soviet experts, the task of eradicating malaria throughout Thai Nguyen Province, the first battle in the North Vietnamese malaria eradication effort, will surely be successfully completed in 1960. The complete eradication of the scourge that has plagued the Vietnamese people for generations in the northern half of Vietnam is not far off. (Wang)

### 为了彻底灭蚊

    为了彻底灭蚊
    傍晚，在一个山村外边，一位苏联同志光着上身坐在小溪旁边。一点钟、两点钟、三点钟……他一直静静地坐在那里。这一带是越北自治区恶性疟疾最严重的一个高山地区，疟蚊横行，像恶魔般摧残着当地的高山民族居民。
    蚊虫叮满了这位苏联同志的皮肤。他周身刺痒，有的部位已经叮肿了。可是他所希望的，是把更多的蚊虫吸引到自己光着的上身。依着灯光，他仔细地观察着蚊虫叮人的姿式，然后轻轻地拍打它们，把打的半死不活的蚊子收集起来。这是拿来作疟蚊的分类研究用的。终于，他感到满足了。当他把上衣穿起来的时候，已经是下半夜三点钟。
    当地人民一谈到这位苏联抗疟专家团团长布拉米科夫同志的时候，都满怀着感激和敬佩的心情。关于他和同一起工作的一批苏联专家的忘我劳动精神和善于接近高山民族居民的故事，已广泛流传在越北自治区。是什么力量支持着他们那样忘我的服务精神呢？是一颗坚决要尽早帮助越南人民消灭世世代代摧残着他们的最猖狂的疾病的心。在法国殖民者残酷剥削和愚民政策之下，据调查，越南北纬十七度线以北的一千三百多万人口中，解放前有五百多万人患过或患有疟疾。越北自治区的一百一十六万人口中，绝大部分人患过和患有这种病。根据苏联专家在自治区疟疾最严重的几个地方进行普查的结果，这里的疟疾大部分是由法希拉伦疟原虫引起的恶性疟疾。它经常引起肝脏病变和腹部水肿，病者的死亡率很高。河江省的哥排乡46％人口患腹部水肿。谅山省的一些乡患这种病的达50％以上。疾病严重的地方，全家死绝的情况经常可以看到。在粉米矿区和罗檐镇，街上几乎看不到一个孩子。大词县老百姓为疟疾编了不少痛苦的歌谣，其中有一句说：“这里有生无养，剩下来的只是无精打彩的人”。高山地带的僈族和苗族受疟疾摧残更为严重。解放前，僈族人口急剧下降。苗族人口在太原省全省内只剩下七个人。
    在另一位苏联专家李森科同志的帮助下，越南政府去年已经制订了全民灭疟的初步计划。准备用五年左右的时间在北纬十七度线以北的越南国土上基本消灭疟疾。试点工作去年已在太原省展开。越北自治区各省、县都举行了抗疟誓师大会，苏联专家经常亲自出席大会讲话。省、县、乡纷纷成立各级抗疟委员会。苏联专家还在短短的时间中培养出成百名抗疟医务干部。在一年多时间中，越北自治区（重点在太原省）已喷射了一百多吨灭蚊药剂（滴滴涕按粉剂折算），分发奎宁药二百五十三万多片。越南政府还着手推广挖沟，填坑，堵塞树洞等防蚊措施。
    经过一年多的努力，疟蚊的密度和人民的患病率已显著下降。许多面黄腹肿的儿童和成人已经逐渐脸色红润、腹部消肿。农忙季节经常要靠人民军指战员帮助的许多家庭，已经自己能够下田劳动了。僈族人口已经开始增加。当母亲们抱着甜睡的不再因腹病而啼哭的孩子时，心里有说不出的滋味。一部分还没有文字的高山民族，也托人写了许多信给苏联专家和胡志明主席，表达自己无比喜悦和感激的心情。这些高山民族起先看到苏联专家是外国人，不敢接近。到了苏联专家要走的时候，无论男女老少，都依依不舍。他们说，“苏联专家是亲人”，一定要专家收下他们的礼物。
    苏联专家离开越北自治区已经有一个时期了，但是他们所培养出来的大批抗疟医务干部，正在当地党和政府领导下继续指导着自治区的灭疟运动。苏联专家李森科每月都同他们保持通信联系。最近，自治区的医务干部接到李森科同志从苏联寄来的信，说他在11月间要再到自治区同他们一起工作，大家都非常兴奋。他们说，有了全民性的灭疟运动，加上苏联专家密切援助、指导，北越灭疟的第一战——太原省全省消灭疟疾的任务，一定能够在1960年胜利完成。世世代代摧残着越南人民的恶疾在越南北半部的彻底消灭，已经为期不远了。（王）
