A Visit to a Locally-Built Waterworks
By Our Correspondent Huang Xiao

    In the suburbs of Tianjin, a jeep sped along the flat road on the left bank of the South Canal. The calm waters of the South Canal flowed slowly eastward. On the bank, water pumps continuously drew water from the canal, directing it through long aqueducts, raised a meter above the ground, to the rural, locally-built waterworks along both banks.

    At the headquarters of the Zhongbei Xie Village Production Brigade, the host poured us each a bowl of tea, saying with pride and pleasure, "Please drink! We'll talk after you've had some." He added, "This is our village's locally-made tap water!" We each took a sip; it was indeed clear and sweet.

    Comrade Guo Chuntian, who was in charge of building and managing the waterworks, told us about the process of building their waterworks.

    This village's waterworks began supplying water on July 1st last year. In the past, due to traditional habits and natural conditions, people had to drink the muddy water from the river. Some villages were two or three li away from the riverbank, and it took half an hour to go back and forth to fetch water, which was both time-consuming and laborious. When it rained continuously and the roads were muddy, it was even more troublesome, and they simply drank the stagnant water from the ditches. Every summer, countless people suffered from gastrointestinal illnesses because they drank unclean water. Although the people's health organizations had always been concerned about the cleanliness of the masses' drinking water and implemented water tank bleaching powder disinfection, it was not a convenient and labor-saving solution after all. In May of last year, after Li Lou Village, not far from them, built a waterworks using local methods, the Party Branch Secretary of the CPC Beixie Village pondered day and night, determined to build a waterworks for their village as well. The CPC Nankai District Committee strongly supported this idea and allocated some material expenses. They also invited two engineers from the city to help them design the waterworks. The production brigade raised several wooden beams and fired several thousand bricks in their own kiln. From surveying and design to construction, it only took ten days to build the waterworks, and the muddy river water was transformed into clear, cool, and sweet drinking water.

    Arriving at the waterworks, Uncle Qiu Yueshan, who managed the waterworks, was busy releasing water. After finishing his work, Uncle Qiu led us to visit his garden-like waterworks. The waterworks was built in a courtyard, which was swept clean, almost like a comfortable small house. In the front was the sedimentation tank, and in the back were the filtration tank and the clear water tank. The structure of this waterworks was simple and inexpensive, but the water quality of the tap water produced met the national standards. The sedimentation tank, 14 meters long, 7 meters wide, and 1 meter deep, had a capacity of 46 tons. This tank was also originally a converted old water pit. At the entrance of the sedimentation tank, there was a wire mesh to block larger floating objects. At the outlet of the sedimentation tank, there was a bamboo tube float. When the water in the tank was muddy, the float was lifted, and the muddy water could not flow into the filtration tank; when the water was clear, the float was lowered, and because the bamboo was light, it only floated on the surface of the water, so only the clear water above flowed into the filtration tank. This method was very ingenious.

    "How long does it take for the water to settle in the sedimentation tank before it can enter the filtration tank?"

    "In the summer, when the river water is muddy, it takes six hours; in the winter, when the water is clear, four hours is enough," said Uncle Qiu.

    "What is the turbidity of the water entering the filtration tank?"

    "Generally between 100 and 200 degrees, but after filtration, it is 7 to 9 degrees."

    Uncle Qiu then led us to see how the water entered the filtration tank through the float. The filtration tank was not large, a rectangular brick tank 2.5 meters long, 3 meters wide, and 1.8 meters deep. The bottom of the tank was paved with 30 centimeters of pebbles and 70 centimeters of sand. After filtration, the water flowed from the bottom channels into the clear water tank. On the outside of the tank, there were four faucets, and people drew water from outside the waterworks. The two tanks were covered with large glass windows, with reed curtains hanging above to shade the sun. A disinfection tank was at the entrance of the clear water tank, and bleaching powder solution was slowly dripping into the water through a rubber tube.

    "What is the residual chlorine in the disinfected water?"

    "It's qualified, more than 0.1 milligram per liter of water," Uncle Qiu answered clearly, and he also performed a simple test for us, proving that the water quality was qualified.

    A woman named Wang Xiangzhen came to the faucet to fetch water. I asked her if she could carry it.

    "Gosh, in the past, we had to climb two big slopes to fetch water from the river, the road was far, and the ground was slippery. At most, we could carry four loads in an hour. Now we can carry ten loads in an hour. Besides, in the past, we carried yellow mud soup from the river. Half the water in the jar was clear water, and the other half was muddy water, which took a lot of time! And we couldn't drink the water immediately after fetching it, we had to fetch it early and drink it later. Now it's so good, we can drink it as soon as we fetch it!"

    She added, "If it weren't for the Great Leap Forward last year, where would we get such good water to drink? We used to get stomachaches from drinking river water all the time, but now we drink clean water, and it's much better. Besides, our lives are getting better day by day, production is good, and we also need to pay attention to hygiene. Now we not only have libraries, clinics, and bathhouses, but also tap water."

    土造自来水厂观水记
    本报记者　黄晓
    在天津市郊区，吉普车沿着南运河左岸的平坦的公路奔驰，平静的南运河河水缓缓东流。在河岸上，水泵不停的吸着河水，通过高过地面一米的长长的引水渠，引向沿河两岸农村土造的自来水厂。
    在中北斜村生产大队部，主人给我们每人倒了一碗茶，“请喝吧！喝过了再谈。”口气是自豪而愉快地说：“这是我们村的土造自来水啊！”我们每人喝了一口，果真是又清又甜。
    负责兴建和管理水厂的郭春田同志向我们介绍了他们兴建自来水厂的经过。
    这个村的自来水厂是去年7月1日开始供水的。过去由于传统的习惯和自然条件的限制，人们不得不喝河里浑浊的水，有的村离河岸二、三里地远，挑一次水来回半个多小时，既费时间，又费力气；遇到阴雨连天，道路泥泞，更是麻烦，干脆就喝些水沟里的死水。每年夏季，不知多少人因为饮了不干净的水而害肠胃病。虽然，人民的卫生机关向来关心群众的饮水清洁，实行水缸漂白粉消毒，但毕竟不是又方便又省力的好办法。去年5月，距他们不远的李楼村用土办法创建了自来水厂以后，中共北斜村的党总支书记日夜琢磨起来，也要为本村建一座自来水厂。中共南开区委大力支持了这个意见，还拨下了一部分材料费，从市里请来了两名工程师帮他们设计，生产大队筹集了几根木梁，在自己窑里烧了几千块砖。从测量、设计到施工，只用了十天的时间，水厂建成了，浑浊的河水变成又清凉又甜的饮水。
    来到自来水厂，管理水厂的丘月山老大爷，正在忙着放水。丘老大爷作完了工作，便领着我们参观他的像花园似的自来水厂。水厂建在一个庭院里，打扫得干干净净，简直像一幢舒适的小屋，前面是沉淀池，后面是滤水池和清水池。这个水厂的构造简单，造价便宜，但生产的自来水的水质是符合国家规定标准的。一个长十四米、宽七米、深一米的沉淀池，容水量达四十六吨。这个池原来也是利用旧水坑改造的。在沉淀池入口处设有一个铁丝格网，用来阻拦较大的浮游物。在沉淀池的出口处，有一个竹筒作的浮子，当池内水浑浊时，把浮子拉起，浑水便不能流入过滤池；水澄清了，放下浮子，由于竹子轻，只浮在水面上，因此只是上面的清水流入过滤池。这个办法，是想得很巧妙的。
      “要在沉淀池里沉淀多长时间才能进入滤水池呢？”
      “夏季河水浑浊，需六小时；冬季水清，四小时就够了”老大爷说。
    “进入滤水池的浑浊度多少？”
    “一般在一百至二百度之间，但经过过滤后是七至九度。”
    老大爷又引我们看水怎样经过浮子进入滤水池。滤水池不算大，二米半长，三米宽，一点八米深的矩形砖砌池子。池底铺了三十公分厚的卵石和七十公分砂子。水经过过滤后，从池底孔道进入清水池。在池的外面，安着四个水龙头，人们就在水厂外面取水。这两个水池是用大玻璃窗盖着的，上面挂了遮太阳的苇帘。有一个消毒罐在清水池的入口处，漂白粉溶液正经过橡皮管，徐徐滴入水中。
    “经过消毒的水剩余氯多少呢？”
    “是合格的啊，每公升水是零点一毫克以上。”老大爷回答得清清楚楚，而且他还为我们作了一个简单的化验，证明水质是合格的。
    一个叫王相珍的妇女，来到水龙头接水，我问她可挑得动？
      “吓，过去我们到河里挑水得爬两个大坡，路又远，地又滑，一个钟头顶多挑四挑，现在一个钟头挑十挑。再说过去挑河里的黄泥汤，一缸落半缸——半缸清水、半缸泥水，多费时间啊！而且现挑不能现吃，要早挑晚吃。现在多好，当时吃水当时挑！”
    她又说：“要没有去年的大跃进，哪里有这样的好水喝？早先喝河水，尽闹肚子的，现在喝干净水，可好多了。再说我们的日子一天天好过起来，生产好，还要讲卫生。现在我们不光有图书馆、诊疗所、澡堂，也有自来水了。”（附图片）
