Xinhua News Agency, 17th dispatch: The people in the vast area of the middle reaches of the Yellow River continue to expand the area under control of soil erosion in the Loess Plateau, creating conditions for further development of agricultural production; reducing sediment in the Yellow River and protecting the Sanmenxia Reservoir.

Now, from the agricultural area in the northeast of Qinghai Province in the west, to the Taihang Mountains in the east, to the Qinling and Funiu Mountains in the south, and to the Daqing Mountains in the north, seven provinces (autonomous regions) located in the middle reaches of the Yellow River, including Qinghai, Gansu, Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, Shaanxi, Shanxi, and Henan, have nearly ten million people working on soil and water conservation and water conservancy construction on the 430,000 square kilometers of the Loess Plateau.

This new upsurge in soil and water conservation in the middle reaches of the Yellow River occurred after the criticism of right-leaning thoughts; especially because the Sanmenxia Reservoir is about to be completed, it is necessary to accelerate the control of soil erosion on the Loess Plateau and reduce the sediment entering the reservoir, so the enthusiasm of the masses is greater than in previous years, and the scope of comprehensive management of large river basins is even more extensive.

Many people's communes in various places immediately invested in soil and water conservation and water conservancy construction work as soon as the "Three Autumns" production ended. From the beginning of October to November 11, Luoyang Prefecture in Henan Province, in addition to expanding the irrigation area by more than 810,000 mu through water conservancy projects, has completed soil and water conservation projects such as terraced fields, embankments, ponds and dams, gully control dams, fish-scale pits, afforestation, and forest closure for cultivation, which can control soil erosion in an area of ​​more than 590 square kilometers. By the beginning of November, Shanxian County in this prefecture had completed 61% of the task of controlling soil erosion this winter. Shaanxi Province has invested 1.55 million people in this movement, initially controlling soil erosion in an area of ​​more than 240 square kilometers. Gansu Province has 2.5 million people participating in soil and water conservation work, initially controlling soil erosion in an area of ​​more than 11,000 square kilometers. The 100,000 laborers in Lin County, Shanxi Province, who are participating in soil and water conservation, have built nearly 150,000 mu of level terraces, leveled 3,618 mu of land, afforested nearly 5,000 mu, planted more than 4,000 mu of grass, and also started construction of 13 irrigation canals and a reservoir. More than 250,000 people in various leagues, banners, and counties in the Yellow River Basin of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are engaged in afforestation and other soil and water conservation work. The scale of repairing irrigation canals, terraced fields, and leveling land in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region has also exceeded that of previous years. There are 300,000 people of all ethnic groups in the agricultural area in northeastern Qinghai Province, vigorously developing water conservancy and soil and water conservation projects in the Yellow River and its tributary, the Huangshui River basin.

The area of ​​soil erosion in the Yellow River Basin is 430,000 square kilometers, and an average of 1.4 billion tons of sediment flows into the Yellow River and passes through Sanmenxia every year. After ten years of management, more than 170,000 square kilometers have been initially controlled, and the sediment passing through Sanmenxia has been reduced by 5.8%. In order to further change the face of the Loess Plateau, the Party and government leading organs of various provinces (autonomous regions) successively held special meetings in October to formulate plans for water conservancy construction and soil and water conservation, and established leadership institutions at all levels; moreover, planning, design, preparation, and construction are progressing simultaneously, accelerating the progress.

Many places have given play to subjective initiative, tapped potential, raised funds on their own, and manufactured water conservancy and soil and water conservation materials and equipment in soil and water conservation work. Various counties and prefectures in Shaanxi Province have solved the problem of a large number of equipment themselves. The cement, explosives, lime and other materials needed in Yan'an Prefecture are all self-made. Many places in Shanxi Province have manufactured a large number of explosives for construction.

### 控制水土流失促进生产发展保护三门峡水库  七省协作治理黄土高原  近千万人修灌渠，建水库，植树种草，平整土地

    控制水土流失促进生产发展保护三门峡水库
    七省协作治理黄土高原
    近千万人修灌渠，建水库，植树种草，平整土地
    新华社17日讯　黄河中游广大地区的人民继续扩大控制黄土高原水土流失面积，为进一步发展农业生产创造条件；减少黄河泥沙，保护三门峡水库。
    现在，西起青海省东北部的农业区，东到太行山，南达秦岭和伏牛山区，北抵大青山，位于黄河中游地区的青海、甘肃、宁夏、内蒙古、陕西、山西、河南等七个省（区），已经有近千万人民在四十三万平方公里的黄土高原，进行水土保持和水利建设工作。
    黄河中游地区这次水土保持新高潮，是在批判了右倾思想后出现的；特别是因为三门峡水库即将建成，需要加速控制黄土高原的水土流失，减少黄河的泥沙进入水库，因而群众的干劲比起往年更大，大流域综合治理的范围也更加广泛。
    各地许多人民公社在三秋生产一结束，就立即投入水土保持和水利建设工作。河南省洛阳专区从10月初到11月11日，除了水利工程扩大灌溉面积八十一万多亩外，已经做成梯田、地埂、塘堰坝、谷坊、鱼鳞坑、植树造林、封山育林等水土保持工程，可控制水土流失面积五百九十多平方公里。这个专区的陕县，到11月上旬已完成今冬控制水土流失面积任务的61％。陕西省投入这一运动的有一百五十五万人，初步控制水土流失面积二百四十多平方公里。甘肃省有二百五十万人参加水土保持工作，初步控制水土流失面积一点一万多平方公里。山西省临县参加水土保持的十万名劳动力，已修水平梯田近十五万亩，平整土地三千六百一十八亩，造林近五千亩，种草四千多亩，还有十三条灌溉渠和一座水库已开工。内蒙古自治区黄河流域的各盟、旗、县有二十五万多人在做植树造林等水土保持工作。宁夏回族自治区修灌渠、梯田和平整土地的规模也超过了往年。青海省东北部农业区有三十万各族人民，在黄河及其支流湟水流域大兴水利和水土保持工程。
    黄河流域水土流失的面积共有四十三万平方公里，平均每年流入黄河、经过三门峡的泥沙有十四亿吨。经过十年来的治理，已经初步控制十七万多平方公里，通过三门峡的泥沙减少了5.8％。为了进一步改变黄土高原的面貌，各省（区）党、政领导机关，都在10月份先后召开了专门会议，制定了水利建设和水土保持的规划，成立了各级领导机构；而且规划、设计、准备、施工齐头并进，加速进度。
    许多地方在水土保持工作中，发挥主观能动性，挖掘潜力，自筹资金，自造水利和水土保持物料器材。陕西省各专县自己解决了大批器材。延安专区需要的水泥、炸药、石灰等物料，都是自造的。山西省好多地方自造了大批施工用的炸药。
