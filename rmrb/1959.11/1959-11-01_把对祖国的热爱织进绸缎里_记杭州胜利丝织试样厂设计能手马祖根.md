　　Have you ever seen a silk fabric that skillfully intertwines printing, weaving, and hollowing techniques? This kind of silk is a new attempt in weaving technology, and its composition and layering of themes are even more fascinating. Looking closely, it has various patterns; from a distance, it resembles swirling clouds and flowers. The changing clouds, colorful flowers, tender green grass, and fluttering butterflies are subtly and beautifully set off, giving it a three-dimensional feel like an oil painting. This is the Dongfeng (East Wind) Silk designed by Ma Zungen, a designer at the Hangzhou Victory Silk Weaving Sample Factory.

　　Painstakingly Designing Dongfeng Silk

　　In March of last year, Ma Zungen attended the National Silk Conference. Chen Weiji, Vice Minister of Textile Industry, said in his report: "We must weave new varieties quickly, well, and economically, which is a peaceful competition with capitalist countries." Minister Chen's words left a deep impression on Ma Zungen, pointing out the direction of his efforts and inspiring him to create exquisite, high-end, and cutting-edge varieties. At the conference, Ma Zungen assured the Party that he would design a new printed and jacquard variety within three months.

　　Late at night, it is the best time for reverie. Every night when Ma Zungen rested, he would think about the design pattern of Dongfeng Silk in bed. The patterns he was familiar with churned in his mind, but he could never find an ideal theme. "Old Ma, you can't walk in other people's footsteps, you must have the spirit of originality!" The words of Wu Axing, the Party Branch Secretary, echoed in his ears once again. It must have its own style, it must be original; if it is just a change from big flowers to small flowers, from peonies to orchids, what kind of new variety is that!

　　Days passed. It was already April. Comrade Ma Zungen attended the Provincial Advanced Producers Representative Conference. One night, they took a train to visit the Xin'an River Hydropower Station construction site. Ma Zungen, with a anxious heart, boarded the train with the representatives.

　　The sky was not yet bright. The wheels moved rhythmically forward, and the representatives had all fallen asleep. Comrade Ma Zungen smoked cigarette after cigarette, staring at the blurry night outside the window, racking his brains to find a picture for Dongfeng Silk.

　　The train drove across the plains and over the hills, and time slipped away mercilessly. The shrill sound of the train whistle woke Old Ma from his daze. He opened the car window to let the cool breeze clear his mind. Looking at the vaguely outlined mountain village in the distance, he began to daydream again. Gradually, the east turned from fish-belly white to cyan, and then a red halo began to appear. This scene caught his attention. He saw the beautiful dawn. The sun slowly rose from the horizon, radiating colorful light, with thin clouds floating above, and colorful clouds showing through the clouds. A layer of light veil floated on the river, and a touch of green hills, verdant trees and rice fields, appeared in the morning mist, forming a natural picture. He admired and praised it..., and suddenly he thought of the pattern he wanted to design. These distinct layers of three-dimensional looming scenery were exactly the theme he had been looking for for countless days and nights! How beautiful! He shouted happily, excitedly waking up the sleeping companions, sharing the beautiful morning of the motherland, and telling them about his unusual discovery.

　　Day broke, and Ma Zungen and the representatives stepped onto the construction site of the Xin'an River Hydropower Station with excitement. At the construction site, the magnificent scene and the soaring enthusiasm of the workers further inspired Old Ma's determination and confidence in designing Dongfeng Silk. After the visit, he forgot his fatigue and told the Party branch as soon as he returned to the factory. The Party branch helped Old Ma study the trial production plan, and told Old Ma that he could ask a draftsman to draw a small sample. One small sample after another was drawn, but none of them drew out the "ideal". At this time, the design team leader also came to help.

　　"Old Ma, pay attention to the fact that jacquard and printing cannot be harmonized, and the two are difficult to match." The words of the design team leader made Old Ma doubtful about the design of new varieties. But when he thought of the Party's education for him, and that in order to create a beloved variety within three months to win glory for the motherland, he was full of energy again. He made up his mind: "The experiment must be persisted, and no matter how great the difficulties are, it cannot be abandoned halfway." However, the words of the design team leader also gave him new inspiration and sincere help. So, based on the problems he raised, and based on the characteristics of printing warp and jacquard having upper and lower layers, he analyzed and studied with other comrades, and finally came up with a solution, but Old Ma still had some doubts: "If the design really fails, won't it be a waste of a lot of manpower, time and financial resources in vain?" Just as he was hesitating, the Party gave him courage and strength. "Old Ma, be bold to experiment, tell me if you have any difficulties at any time, and the Party organization will strongly support you." How kind and encouraging the concern and encouragement of the Party branch secretary! At this time, the leadership transferred a young and experienced draftsman to be Old Ma's assistant, and Old Ma continued the experiment with great confidence, and the pattern was finally drawn. Finally, the Italian drawing was also completed. Old Ma was as happy as if he had just had his first child!

　　All preparations were completed, and the final step was to wait for the machine test. In order to avoid detours and reduce the loss of shiny real silk, Old Ma obtained the consent of the weaving loom operator to first use the remaining warp threads for trial weaving. After weaving more than two meters, seeing that it fully met the design requirements, he formally tried weaving. In this way, a new variety of Dongfeng Silk, which combines printing, weaving, and digging, which is loved by everyone, was finally successfully trial-woven with the support of the Party and the help of comrades.

　　The new variety of Dongfeng Silk, named after "The East Wind prevails over the West Wind," was praised and welcomed by the people of the Soviet Union and other brother countries when the samples were sent abroad.

　　The Birth of Liwen Brocade and Sofa Silk

　　Because Comrade Ma Zungen is serious and responsible for creative design and has a deep observation ability of things, he has solved the problems in the themes and weaving organization and compilation in his creative process more than once.

　　One day, Ma Zungen was lying on the table drawing his newly designed variety. He had thought more than once that Dongfeng Silk had been successfully trial-woven and put into mass production, but Dongfeng Silk was expensive and complicated to weave. If a printing warp procedure could be reduced and the same effect of combining jacquard and printing could be achieved, wouldn't it be suitable for more working people to wear? But the question is how to make the pattern have a vague feeling like printing warp in the visual sense? How to overcome the problem of looseness? This is a difficult problem in the organization structure of weaving. For two months, he has drawn many sketches and calculated the warp and weft organization with his ten fingers over and over again, but he has not found a satisfactory answer. Ma Zungen was drawing on the table..., suddenly, he remembered the bamboo curtain on the east window he often watched. The bamboo curtain swayed in the wind, the sunlight on the curtain was sometimes strong and sometimes weak, and the scenery outside the curtain was sometimes hidden and sometimes visible, just like the feeling of combining printing and jacquard on the fabric. So a new idea came to his mind; if the shape of the bamboo curtain is used to make the weft organization of the fabric surface bulge regularly section by section, wouldn't the pattern be like hiding behind the bamboo curtain? Wouldn't the problem of the connection of the bamboo curtain and the looseness of the two sides be solved? This is a great inspiration. He also carefully observed the changes in the color tone of the scenery outside the bamboo curtain under different light intensities. The problem that he had been thinking about day and night for two months was finally solved, so he created Liwen Brocade, a first-class variety that was rated at the National Color and Variety Appraisal Conference. This variety has been selected into the export samples for 1960.

　　Someone asked Ma Zungen: "Old Ma, do you have any secrets?" In fact, it is very simple to say. The secret of Ma Zungen's success is that in order to build socialism and win honor for the motherland, under the leadership of the Party and with the help of his comrades, he succeeded through repeated thinking, observing life and designing.

　　The successful trial weaving of Dongfeng Silk and Liwen Brocade is, for Ma Zungen, the beginning of his trial weaving of high-grade, exquisite and cutting-edge varieties.

　　Have you seen the Hongqi (Red Flag) sedan car? That is the first-class sedan car produced by our country. But do you know that in that shiny sedan car, on that soft and elastic sofa, the sofa silk with harmonious colors and novel style was also designed by Old Ma after the successful trial weaving of Dongfeng Silk and Liwen Brocade!

　　In July last year, the leadership assigned the task of weaving sofa silk for the Hongqi sedan car. Time was tight, and the Victory Silk Weaving Factory had never produced it before. Everyone felt thorny about the organization structure. At this time, Ma Zungen was in poor health, but he thought that this was the first-class sedan car produced by the motherland, and it would gallop in front of Tiananmen Square to accept Chairman Mao's review. So he decided to take on this glorious task. The secretary and the factory director repeatedly told him to rest, but Ma Zungen still repeatedly requested to continue. In the end, the sofa silk for the sedan car was completed one month ahead of schedule after his sleepless nights.

　　Decorating the Motherland More Beautifully

　　Old Ma often said: Socialist life is beautiful, not only to make people live happily, but also to dress beautifully, to arrange the environment beautifully, to make every working people feel happy and work harder. In this way, he designed decorative silk in 1958.

　　For the leap forward of the silk industry, in order to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of our great motherland, Old Ma and other designers in the factory were honored to participate in the design tasks of decorative silk for the Great Hall of the People and other top ten buildings in the capital. Beijing is the place where our Party Central Committee and our beloved leader Chairman Mao are located. The top ten buildings are historical buildings. It is the entrustment of 600 million people of the motherland to add icing on the cake to these buildings and design various decorative silks. It is to show the brilliant achievements of China's silk industry in the past ten years. Old Ma is simply so happy that he can't sleep every day. However, he was also very anxious, because he felt that the requirements of "gentle, generous, no strong flash of color, and patterns should be gorgeous, majestic, and dignified..." were not easy to achieve. What if he could not complete the task? Old Ma thought again. He consulted ancient cultural relics materials, looked at the design of silk and cloth shop windows, the patterns of pedestrians' clothes, and even the colors and patterns of a piece of candy wrapper. He looked at them endlessly as if he had found treasures. Finally, he finally selected the theme of peony flowers. The woven peony brocade looks gentle, generous, solemn and beautiful, with full branches and leaves, and the color is gentle, and the color fastness and quality fastness meet the requirements. Looking at it, the high patterns have a three-dimensional feeling. At the same time, he also successfully designed two new varieties, Shuangfeng Towel and Nylon Yarn Fabric Silk, including the Chao Ying Satin and Yun Mu Brocade that he had designed successfully before. All four varieties were selected.

　　"Fighting hard in August and September, presenting generous gifts to celebrate the National Day" - this is the issue that Old Ma cared about most in the first two months of the third quarter of this year. While completing the design of decorative silk for the top ten buildings, he also imitated the Song Brocade Zhang Velvet and Jinbaodi two varieties, creating two precious varieties of Wanhua Brocade and Caidi Flower Velvet.

　　Ma Zungen is fifty years old this year. In the old society, he studied silk design work from the age of fifteen, and did it for more than 20 years, but he didn't get anything out of it. His personal life was like a rootless duckweed, floating east and west, running around for life all day long, and as a result, his family of five still had to fill their stomachs with tofu dregs, and there was no time to engage in any design. Once, Old Ma wanted to create a new variety of "Spearmint", but what he got was not support and encouragement, but the capitalist's scolding, and even transferred him from the design work to other positions. Thirty-five years of life have told Old Ma that the same labor under two different social systems has different results. Therefore, he painted his infinite love for the new society and his wisdom and political enthusiasm on the design samples, and weaved his painstaking efforts into beautiful silks, dedicated to the great motherland and the people.

    把对祖国的热爱织进绸缎里
    ——记杭州胜利丝织试样厂设计能手马祖根
    你看到过一种把印花、织花、挖花巧妙地交织在一起的绸缎吗？这种绸缎在织造技巧上是一种新的尝试，在题材内容的构图和层次安排上更是引人入胜。近看它有多种花样，远看又是云卷花卉。那些变幻的云霞，缤纷的鲜花，嫩绿的草丛，翩翩的蝴蝶，隐隐约约地衬托得非常美丽，具有油画般的立体感。这就是杭州胜利丝织试样厂设计员马祖根设计的东风绸。
    苦心设计东风绸
    去年3月，马祖根出席了全国丝绸会议。纺织工业部陈维稷副部长在报告中说：“我们必须多快好省地织造新品种，这是和资本主义国家的一场和平竞赛”。陈部长的话给马祖根留下了深刻的印象，为他指明了努力的方向，启发了他搞精美、高级、尖端品种的念头。在大会上，马祖根向党作了保证，要在三个月内设计出一种印经加提花的新品种来。
    夜深人静，是遐想的最好时刻。马祖根每天晚上休息的时候都在床上想着东风绸的设计图案，那些他所熟悉的图案在脑子里翻腾着，但总找不到理想的题材。“老马，不能踩着别人的脚印走路，要有独创的精神！”党支部书记吴阿兴的话又一次在他的耳际回荡着。要有自己的风格，要有独创性；如果仅仅是大花换小花，牡丹换上兰花，那还叫什么新品种呢。！
    日子一天天过去。已经是4月里了。马祖根同志出席了省先进生产者代表会议。一天晚上，他们乘火车去参观新安江水电站工地。马祖根怀着焦急的心情，与代表们一同乘上了火车。
    天还未亮。车轮有节奏地前进着，代表们都已沉入梦乡。马祖根同志香烟烧了一支又一支，凝视着窗外迷糊的黑夜，他在为寻找东风绸的画面而绞尽脑汁。
    列车驶过平原，越过丘陵，时间不留情地溜去。火车汽笛的尖叫声，把老马从迷糊中惊醒。他打开了车窗，让凉风清醒一下头脑。了望着远方轮廓不清的山庄，他又开始了遐想。渐渐地东方泛出了鱼肚白，继而由白色变为青色，开始显出了一道红晕。这一幅景象引起了他的注意。他看到了美丽的晨曦。太阳从地平线上徐徐地升起，五颜六色的光芒四射，薄薄的云层浮在上面，彩霞从云层里透现出来。小河飘着一层轻纱，一抹青山，碧绿青葱的树丛和稻田，在晨雾中隐现，构成一幅天然的画面。他欣赏着，赞美着……，突然他想到自己要设计的图案，这些层次分明，有立体感的隐现景色，不正是自己无数个白天和黑夜所寻求的题材吗？好美啊！他高兴得叫了起来，兴奋地拉醒了还在沉睡的同伴，共同欣赏祖国美丽的早晨，告诉他们自己不平常的发现。
    天亮了，马祖根和代表们带着兴奋的心情踏上了新安江水电站的工地。工地上，那宏伟的场面，工人冲天的干劲，更激励了老马设计东风绸的决心和信心。参观回来，疲劳也忘掉了，一回厂就告诉了党支部。党支部帮助老马研究了试制计划，并告诉老马可以请一位绘图员画小样。小样画了一张又一张，可是张张都没有画出“理想”。这时，设计组长也来帮忙了。
    “老马，要注意提花和印花不能调和，二者难于套配。”设计组长的话，使老马对新品种的设计产生了疑虑。但当他一想到党对他的教育，想到为了在三个月内搞出一个心爱的品种为祖国争光的时候，他又浑身是劲了。他拿定主意：“试验一定要坚持下去，有天大的困难也不能半途而废。”但是，设计组长的话也确实给了他新的启发和诚恳的帮助。于是，老马根据他提出的问题，再根据印经和提花有上有下的特点，找其他同志共同分析研究，终于想出了解决的办法，但老马还有些疑虑：“如果设计真的失败了，不就要白白浪费了很多的人力、时间和财力吗？”正当犹豫的时候，党又给了他勇气和力量。“老马，要大胆试验，你有什么困难随时告诉我，党组织大力支持”。支部书记的关怀和鼓励是多么亲切啊！这时，领导上调来了一位年青的有经验的绘图员做老马的助手，老马信心百倍地继续进行试验，图案终于画出来了。最后意样图也画成了。老马像刚得了第一个孩子一样，是多么高兴啊！
    一切准备都做好了，最后还待上机试验。为了少走弯路，少损失闪闪发亮的真丝，老马征得了立织挡车工的同意，先用织剩下的经线进行试织，织到二米多，看看完全达到了设计的要求，再正式试织。就这样，一种人人心爱的、有印花、织花、挖花三者合一的新品种东风绸，在党的支持和同志们的帮助下，终于试织成功了。
    东风绸这个以“东风压倒西风”而定名的新品种，在样品出国的时候，就受到苏联和其他兄弟国家人民的赞扬和欢迎。
  丽纹锦和沙发绸的诞生
    由于马祖根同志对创作设计的严肃认真对事物有深刻的观摩能力，曾不止一次地解决了他在创作过程中题材和织物组织编制上的难题。
    一天，马祖根正伏在桌上画他新设计的品种。他已不止一次地想到，东风绸已试织成功，大量投入生产，但是，东风绸成本高、织造过程复杂，如果能减少一道印经手续而又能取得和提花、印花合一的同样效果，那不是可以适合于更多的劳动人民穿用吗？但问题是如何使花纹在视觉上有印经那样隐隐约约的感觉？如何克服松散的毛病？这是一个织物组织结构上的难题，两个月来，他已画了很多草图，用十个手指头比作经纬组织反复盘算过千百次了，但没找到圆满的答案。马祖根在桌上画着画着……，忽然，他想起了他经常观看的东面窗口上的竹帘，竹帘迎风摇曳，帘上的阳光，忽浓忽淡，帘外的景物时隐时现，犹如织物上印花、提花合一的感觉。于是一个新的念头油然而生；如果用竹帘的形状使织物表面一节节的纬线组织有规律地凸起，这样花纹不就是如同隐藏在竹帘的后面了么？竹帘的串联，二面松散的问题不也就解决了吗？这是一个很大的启发。他又仔细地观察了在光线强弱不同的情况下，竹帘外景物色调的变化。二个月来日夜苦思的难题终于解决了，这样他又创造了在全国花色品种评选会上被评为一类品种的丽纹锦。这个品种已选入1960年的出国样品。
    有人问马祖根：“老马，你有什么秘诀吗？”其实，说穿了也很简单，马祖根成功的秘诀就是他为了建设社会主义，为祖国争得荣誉，在党的领导和同志们的帮助下，经过反反复复的思考、观察生活和设计而成功的。
    东风绸和丽纹锦的试织成功，对马祖根来说，是他试织高级、精美尖端品种的一个开端。
    你看到过红旗牌小轿车了吗？那是我国自己生产的第一流的小轿车。但是你知道在那闪光发亮的轿车里，在那柔软而富有弹性的沙发上，那色彩调和、风格新颖的沙发绸也是老马在东风绸和丽纹锦试织成功以后设计的吗！
    去年7月，领导上下达了赶织红旗牌小轿车沙发绸的任务。时间很紧，而且胜利丝织厂从来没有生产过。大家对组织结构感到棘手。这时，马祖根身体很不好，但是他想到这是祖国生产的第一流小轿车，它将奔驰在天安门前接受毛主席的检阅。于是他决心把这个光荣任务担当起来。书记、厂长千叮万嘱要他休息，但是马祖根还是再三要求搞下去。最后，小轿车的沙发绸就这样经过他的多少个不眠之夜，提前一个月完成了交货任务。
    把祖国装饰得更美丽
    老马常常说：社会主义的生活就是美，不仅要使人们生活过得幸福，而且要穿戴得漂亮，环境布置得漂亮，要使每一个劳动人民身心愉快，工作起来劲头更大。这样，在1958年他设计了装饰用绸。
    为了丝绸工业的跃进，为了庆祝我们伟大祖国建国十周年，老马和厂里其他设计人员都荣幸地参加了首都人民大会堂等十大建筑装饰用绸的设计任务。北京是我们党中央和敬爱的领袖毛主席所在的地方。十大建筑是历史性建筑，为这些建筑物锦上添花、设计各色的装饰用绸，是祖国六亿人民的委托，是显示中国丝绸工业十年来辉煌的成就，老马简直是天天高兴得睡不着觉。但是，他也非常着急，因为他感到“文静、大方、色彩无强烈闪光、图案要华贵、雄壮、威严……”的要求是不易达到的，完不成任务怎么办？老马又思索了，他翻阅了古代文物资料，看了绸布店橱窗的设计、行人衣着的花式，甚至连一片糖果包装纸的色彩、图案，他都如获珍宝地看个不休。最后，他终于选定了牡丹花这个题材，织出来的牡丹锦显得文静、大方、壮严美观、枝叶丰满、色泽温和、色牢度和质牢度都符合要求，看起来，高花纹有立体的感觉。同时他还设计成功了双凤巾和尼龙纱发绸两个新品种，包括以前设计成功的超英缎、云慕锦等四个品种，都被选用了。
    “大战8、9月，厚礼献国庆”，这是今年三季度头两个月中，老马最记挂的问题。他在完成十大建筑装饰用绸设计的同时，又仿宋锦璋绒和金宝地二个品种，创造出万花锦和采地花绒两个珍贵的品种。
    马祖根今年五十岁了。在旧社会里，他从十五岁起就学习绸缎设计工作，搞了二十来年，什么也没有搞出来。他个人的生活，像一片无根的浮萍，飘东浮西，整天为生活而奔命，结果仍旧弄得一家五口以豆腐渣充饥，那里还有心思去搞什么设计。有一次，老马想搞一个“留兰香”的新品种，那知得到的不是支持和鼓励，而是资本家的痛斥，甚至把他从设计工作调到了其他岗位。三十五年来的生活，告诉老马在两种不同的社会制度下同样的劳动，得到的却是两种结果，所以，他把自己对新社会无限的热爱，把自己的智慧和政治热情画到设计的小样上，把自己的心血织成了美丽的绸缎，献给了伟大的祖国和人民。
