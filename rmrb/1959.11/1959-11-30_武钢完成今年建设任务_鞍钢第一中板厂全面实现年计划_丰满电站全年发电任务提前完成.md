Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan: By the 21st, Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation had overfulfilled its annual construction task by 0.28% ahead of schedule. The annual cost reduction plan was overfulfilled by 5% ahead of schedule at the end of October. The No. 2 blast furnace, No. 1 and No. 2 open-hearth furnaces, as well as thirteen major projects such as ore dressing machines, sintering machines, and coking furnaces, which were constructed this year, have been put into production ahead of schedule.

Wuhan Iron and Steel's early completion of its annual capital construction plan is a victory in implementing the Party's general line of building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. They used the experience of launching mass movements on a large scale in 1958, implemented the spirit of the General Line, used political movements to promote production, unified command, strengthened collaboration, mobilized the masses to carry out technical revolution and technical innovation movements, launched concentrated attacks in batches, and carried out construction quickly and with high quality, thus enabling the entire project construction to meet the requirements of greater, faster, better, and more economical results. For example, the No. 2 blast furnace was built and put into production in one hundred and forty days, shortening the construction period by nearly ten months compared to the No. 1 blast furnace; the completion time of the No. 1 open-hearth furnace was nine months ahead of the original plan; the No. 2 open-hearth furnace, which is much larger than the No. 1 open-hearth furnace, was built in only thirty days, which is even faster than building the No. 1 open-hearth furnace. The quality of these projects, after strict inspection and verification, has been proved to be excellent.

Xinhua News Agency, Anshan: Anshan Iron and Steel's No. 1 Medium Plate Mill has overfulfilled this year's high-quality steel plate production task forty days and seven hours ahead of schedule. In terms of quality, the first-class product rate of steel plates exceeded the original target by 1.51%; product costs were reduced by 599,000 yuan, and the annual cost reduction target has been achieved ahead of schedule. There have also been significant achievements in safe production.

As early as the beginning of this year, the factory Party committee criticized the right-leaning and relaxed mood of some cadres who believed that "the old factory and old equipment cannot achieve a comprehensive leap forward this year," and, based on the specific situation of frequent equipment accidents in the past, launched a large-scale airing of views, debates, and discussions among the masses, focusing on the maintenance and repair of heating furnaces, rolling mills, and finishing equipment. Subsequently, the factory's employees launched a wave of technical revolution and technical innovation, proposing a series of measures to improve equipment and break through key problems.

While mobilizing all factory employees to strengthen equipment maintenance and ensure high-quality and high-yield production, this factory also organized employees to carry out activities to save raw materials and materials in every possible way, thus ensuring the continuous reduction of costs. In terms of safety, they adhered to a system of major inspections every quarter, medium inspections every month, and minor inspections every week. Through mass inspections, they conducted safety ideological education for employees and took a series of safety measures. Therefore, since the beginning of this year, this factory has not only eliminated major accidents but also continuously reduced minor accidents.

Xinhua News Agency, Changchun: Fengman Hydropower Station has completed its annual power generation plan ahead of schedule on November 15th. At the same time, total costs were reduced by 9.28%, plant use of electricity was saved by 58.6% compared to the plan, and a new record of 378 days of safe and economical equipment operation was created.

The employees of Fengman Hydropower Station earnestly studied and implemented the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, and, under the leadership of the Party committee, criticized the right-leaning conservative thinking among some cadres who believed that "hydropower stations can only rely on the heavens for food, and no amount of effort can complete the task if it doesn't rain," thereby quickly setting off a mass upsurge of safe and economical operation with more generation, less use, and saving water and electricity.

Since the beginning of this year, in three major safety inspections, the employees of this hydropower station have put forward a total of more than 29,000 opinions and suggestions on equipment defects, regulations and systems, production technology management, and other aspects, ensuring absolutely safe operation.

    武钢完成今年建设任务
    鞍钢第一中板厂全面实现年计划
    丰满电站全年发电任务提前完成
    据新华社武汉电　到21日止，武汉钢铁公司已超额0.28％提前完成了全年的施工任务。全年降低成本的计划，早在10月底就超额5％提前完成了。今年建设的二号高炉，一号、二号平炉，以及选矿机、烧结机、炼焦炉等十三个重大项目，都已先后提前投入生产。
    武钢提前完成全年基本建设计划，是贯彻党的多快好省的建设方针的胜利。他们运用1958年大搞群众运动的经验，贯彻总路线的精神，用政治运动来推动生产，统一指挥，加强协作，发动群众开展技术革命和技术革新运动，分批突击，快速优质施工，因而使整个工程建设达到了多快好省的要求。如二号高炉一百四十天就建成投入生产，比一号高炉工期缩短将近十个月；一号平炉建成期限，比原计划提前九个月；比一号平炉大得多的二号平炉，建成时间只用了三十天，比建一号平炉还快得多。这些工程的质量，经过严格检验证明，都达到了优等。
    据新华社鞍山电　鞍钢第一中板厂已经提前四十天零七小时超额完成今年的优质钢板生产任务。质量方面，钢板一级品率超出原订指标1.51％；产品成本下降五十九万九千元，已提前完成全年降低成本的指标。安全生产方面也很有成绩。
    早在今年初，工厂党委就批判了某些干部认为“老厂旧设备，今年不能全面跃进”的右倾松劲情绪，并且根据以往设备事故较多的具体情况，围绕加热炉、压延机和精整设备的维护检修问题，发动群众展开了大鸣大放大辩论。随后，全厂职工又掀起了技术革命和技术革新的热潮，提出了一系列改进设备、突破关键的措施。
    在发动全厂职工加强设备维修、保证优质高产的同时，这个厂还组织职工展开了千方百计的节约原料和材料的活动，因而保证了成本的不断降低。在安全方面，他们坚持了每季一次大检查、每月一次中检查、每周一次小检查的制度。通过群众性的检查，对职工进行安全思想教育，采取一系列安全措施，因此今年以来，这个厂不仅消灭了重大事故，而且轻微的事故也不断减少。
    据新华社长春电　丰满水电站已在11月15日提前超额完成了全年发电计划。同时，总成本降低9.28％，厂用电比计划节约58.6％，还创造了设备安全经济运行三百七十八天的新纪录。
    丰满水电站职工认真地学习和贯彻党的八届八中全会决议，在党委的领导下，批判了部分干部中认为“水电站只能靠天吃饭，天不下雨再努力也完不成任务”的右倾保守思想，从而迅速掀起了群众性的多发少用、省水节电的安全经济运行竞赛高潮。
    今年以来，这个水电站在三次安全大检查中，职工们对设备缺陷、规程制度、生产技术管理等各个方面，共提出了两万九千多条意见和建议，保证了绝对安全运行。
