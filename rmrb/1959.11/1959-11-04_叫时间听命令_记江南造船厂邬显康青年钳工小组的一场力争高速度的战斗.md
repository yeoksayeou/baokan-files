Make Time Obey Orders
—A Record of a High-Speed Battle of the Wu Xiankang Youth Fitter Team at Jiangnan Shipyard

Do people still remember? In the Great Leap Forward year of 1958, the Jiangnan Shipyard in Shanghai built China's first 5,000-ton ocean-going vessel, the "Peace 28," in just over five months, shortening the original plan by about thirteen months and creating a new record unprecedented in the history of China's shipbuilding industry. In this struggle, the Wu Xiankang Youth Fitter Team of the outfitting workshop boldly broke through conventions, created new methods such as "water backflow" and "using a dummy thrust shaft for positioning," and created a historical record of completing the slipway cycle in seventy days at high speed. This team consists of twenty-three young people. The oldest is no more than twenty-eight years old, and the youngest is not yet twenty years old. It was they who, in the struggle to build another 5,000-ton ocean-going vessel, the "Peace 58," this year, once again created the miracle of completing the slipway cycle outfitting project in nine days and nights.

A Sacred Promise

In early August, shortly after the Jiangnan Shipyard Party Committee announced the news of building the "Peace 58" ocean-going vessel to the entire factory's workers, the Communiqué and Resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party were published. The workers said, "The national plan must be advanced, and our small plan must be advanced first." They further compressed the original guarantee of completing the slipway cycle forty days ahead of last year's construction of the "Peace 28" to thirty-five days. They believed that the speed of shipbuilding must be faster and faster, and the quality must be better and better. Last year's "Peace 28" had a slipway cycle of seventy days, and if we still maintain this speed this year, it cannot be considered a continued leap forward. They said, "We must make time obey the orders of our shipbuilding workers!" In this way, the slipway final assembly of the "Peace 58" advanced with miraculous speed. After the hull workshop completed the hull welding and assembly project at a speed twenty-two days faster than last year, the relay baton of the competition was passed to the comrades of the Wu Xiankang Youth Fitter Team of the outfitting workshop.

Completing the slipway cycle of an ocean-going vessel in thirty-five days, in addition to the hull welding and assembly project, the key lies in the outfitting projects such as the main engine shafting positioning, wire drawing and illumination, and the installation of propellers and steering gear. Now, at what speed is the Wu Xiankang Youth Team, which is responsible for this project, advancing?

One Sunday morning, team leader Wu Xiankang rode his bicycle swiftly through the streets, inviting the team members one by one from warm beds, kitchens, and barbershops to his home to discuss how to continue the leap forward.

They resolved to guarantee to the Party Committee that they would complete this slipway cycle outfitting project in ten days and nights.

Thus, a battle for high speed unfolded within their team.

Late at night on September 12th. On the slipway, the blue electric welding arc cut through the sky, the crane waved its arms heroically, and the surroundings were filled with the deafening "dada" sound and the铿锵 sound of heavy hammers hitting steel plates... The previous process, the hull workshop, was still intensively welding and assembling the hull, and the Wu Xiankang Youth Team had already begun the work of drawing lines for the stern shaft. In a shaft tunnel more than forty meters long, several people managed with great difficulty to straighten a long and thin steel wire from east to west. However, the hull was shaking violently, and the positions at both ends could not be aligned. The welding sparks splashed on the steel wire, and two of them broke in succession. Someone said, "It seems that we cannot proceed until the welding project is completed." No, the next day, several people went on board early to prepare, and at three o'clock in the middle of the night, when people put down their work and went ashore to eat, they launched a surprise attack to draw the lines. Time passed by one minute, five minutes, twenty minutes, and the people who were eating came back one after another. Suddenly, the temporary telephone connecting more than forty meters broke down, and the commands issued from both the east and west ends could not be transmitted. This was like suddenly losing telephone contact at a critical moment in the front-line battle. At this time, the team members quickly lined up like a long snake in the long passage, forming a "living telephone," and loudly continued to transmit commands backward with their mouths: "To the left!" "To the right!" The deafening "dada" sound of the pneumatic chisels rang out again. The team members smiled as they looked at the steel wire that had been drawn accurately and straight. They completed the wire drawing work thirty-six hours earlier than last year.

The Wu Xiankang Youth Team, with the first victory of winning time, entered the second process, drilling twelve holes in the seventh compartment. They calculated again: adopting the method of using cold wind drills to drill holes on the "Peace 28" last year would still take thirty-six hours, which would make it impossible to achieve the speed of completing the outfitting project in ten days. Calculating from the last day of the ten days as the starting point, they were only allowed to spend twelve hours completing this process. Therefore, someone said: "We have always used cold wind drills to drill holes on ships; time cannot be shortened by calculation alone, what can we do?" New difficulties and contradictions arose again.

Ten days, this is a sacred promise. The comrades of the Wu Xiankang Youth Team were determined to fulfill it even if the sky fell.

On the deck, the autumn wind brought a gust of coldness. However, the hearts of the team members were burning with enthusiasm. They discussed three times in a row, insisting on finding a new method to complete the work in twelve hours. They considered that if the shaft tunnel on the ship could be moved to the workshop, the holes could be drilled on the drilling machine, and one hole could be drilled in one hour. Because the fixture on the drilling machine is suitable, unlike the cold wind gun, which is flexible and does not require a lot of time to repeatedly correct. However, the shaft tunnel is like a sewer, how can it be moved to the workshop? ...

At this time, team member Li Qingsheng was not doing this work; the team leader assigned him to do other work. However, he was always concerned about such a major event for the whole team. His wife is a worker in a screw factory and is familiar with drilling technology. Late at night, when he returned home, he discussed the team's major event with his wife. The next day, as soon as he got off work, Li Qingsheng, together with the comrades of the team, improved the steady rest on the cold wind drill according to the fixture principle on the drilling machine. This is like installing a fixed frame when firing a machine gun, so the gun body will not be crooked. This improvement greatly saved the time for drilling and correction. It only took eight hours and fifty minutes, that is to say, twenty-seven hours and ten minutes less than last year, to complete the work of drilling twelve holes, and the quality was better than using the original operating method.

Days and Nights on the Slipway

The records of the previous processes on the production schedule board have been crossed out one by one. The closer the date of the ship's launch, the more the young team members tried their best to seize time and make use of time, step by step, link by link. At this time, they were no longer calculating the progress of the project in hours, but in minutes.

The crane slowly pulled a huge shaft tube weighing more than two thousand kilograms into the cabin, and finally, there was only a distance as thin as an ordinary exercise book, and it could not be pulled in. Someone suggested: Install a support leg outside and push it in with an oil pump. "No!" The comrades of the youth team did not approve of this method, which would take at least a whole day. Therefore, six people used ropes to drag a giant hammer weighing three hundred kilograms, using all their strength to knock the tall shaft tube in. Three hundred kilograms, how heavy! After all, the arms of young people are not the same as the steel arms of cranes. One by one, they were sweating profusely, and hot air kept coming out of their mouths... Thirty minutes later, the distance was closed.

Installing the propeller requires a huge and solid rubber to plug the gap to prevent river water from flowing in. In order to find such a suitable rubber, the team members were not walking but running on the road between the slipway and the warehouse all night, looking like a 100-meter race. The rubber was found, but it was too big and had to be cut with a sharp knife. However, it was late at night, where could we find it? Therefore, the small pocket knives, the knives for cutting beef, the hammers for knocking steel plates... were all used together. No matter how tough the rubber was, it could not compare with the will of these young people, and it was finally cut open.

Installing the stern shaft is a very complicated process. The comrades of the youth team did not leave the slipway for several days and nights, and team leader Wu Xiankang's eyes were full of red threads. However, he was afraid of being seen by his comrades and leaders, who would then pull him off the line to rest. He secretly borrowed a pair of black glasses to wear, so that others could not see his red eyes. However, the cabin was already dark enough, and there was no dazzling light around at this time, so why wear black glasses? The secret was exposed by everyone. The Party branch secretary and the comrades of the team urged him to go back to rest with concern. However, he refused to agree, saying, "Now is the critical moment, look, can I settle down to sleep?"

In the second half of the night of September 21, there was still one day and one night before the ship was launched. There was still one day and one night left before the ten-day period guaranteed by the Wu Xiankang Youth Team to deliver the ship. The comrades of the team were carrying out the final work of the outfitting project before the ship was launched: installing the steering gear.

The Huangpu River seemed quieter than usual, and there was only the rushing sound of tap water from several thick water hoses spraying on the deck. This was the work of washing and so on that people were carrying out to prepare for the ship's launch. Water flowed into the steering gear cabin, which was as small as a small room, and gradually rose, as much as a foot deep. However, the work of installing the steering gear must be carried out at the bottom of the cabin. "What's wrong with that, just work by stepping in the water!" Zhu Ruiqi, the team member responsible for installing the rudder, did not seem to think that the water had anything to do with him. He rolled up his trouser legs and took off his shoes in a few steps, and strode into the water with a "chatter".

The sky was getting brighter, and the cold morning wind swept across the river, rolling down from the upper end of the tall ship. Some people even put on cotton coats. At this time, the tide rose again, seeping into the engine room. The water in the cabin rose bit by bit, already over the knees and over the thighs. The comrades outside the cabin shouted loudly to Zhu Ruiqi: "Wait until dawn and the tide recedes before working." Zhu Ruiqi waved his hand and said: "The key to the last pass is in my hands. If I am one minute slower, the plan will be delayed by one minute!" In front of such highly responsible people, how could the cold wind and cold water stop their enthusiasm? Zhu Ruiqi, dressed in a shirt, soaked half of his body in the water, operating quickly with both hands, and persisted in fighting to the end.

It was this morning, in the cold wind and in the tide, that the Wu Xiankang Youth Team completed all the outfitting projects in the slipway cycle. The time spent was nine days and nine nights, one day and one night ahead of their guarantee to the Party Committee, and five days and five nights ahead of the time spent on the same project on the "Peace 28" last year. They victoriously fulfilled their promise to the Party.

If someone asks, "How was the miracle of the 'Peace 58' 5,000-ton ocean-going vessel being launched in thirty-five days, which is thirty-five days shorter than last year's 'Peace 28', produced?" Then, please take a careful look at these comrades of the Wu Xiankang Youth Team! In the Jiangnan Shipyard, there are hundreds and thousands of such teams. Like the Wu Xiankang Youth Team, they use their whole body and mind to overcome difficulties, boldly create, and work tirelessly in every part, every process, and every operation. Therefore, they won time and won victory. Here, the term "every second counts" is by no means an abstract slogan or concept. This is the manifestation of the willpower of tens of thousands of workers in the entire factory who warmly support the Party's general line and respond to the Party's call for continued leap forward. This is the manifestation of the willpower of tens of thousands of workers in the entire factory who are striving for a happier tomorrow and for the high-speed development of the motherland's shipbuilding industry. Here, people say heroically: "We must make every minute and every second of time create five times, ten times, and one hundred times more things in our hands!" The Wu Xiankang Youth Fitter Team is like this. In this year alone, they have successively installed shafting projects for five ships including the "Jinling," "Jiangsu," etc., each one faster and better than the previous one.

Today, this Jiangnan Shipyard with a long history is full of youthful vitality everywhere. Their determination is to create newer records and complete the entire project of building the "Peace 58" at a higher speed than last year. Now, the boiler of the "Peace 58" has been ignited. In order to present a gift to the National Conference of Heroes, all the workers in the factory, under the leadership of the factory's Party Committee, once again made a guarantee: they are determined to complete the entire project of the "Peace 58" in about four months, that is to say, more than a month faster than the "Peace 28," and use new victories to add new glory to the motherland's shipbuilding industry.

    叫时间听命令
    ——记江南造船厂邬显康青年钳工小组的一场力争高速度的战斗
    人们还记得吗？在大跃进的1958年，上海江南造船厂仅仅用了五个多月的时间，比原订计划缩短了十三个月左右，建成了我国第一艘五千吨大海轮“和平28号”，创造了我国造船工业史上从未有过的新纪录。在这个斗争中，大胆冲破常规，创造了“水倒流”、“以假推力轴代真进行定位”等新方法，创造了以七十天的高速度完成船台周期的历史新纪录的，是舾装车间邬显康青年钳工小组。这个小组，共有二十三个年轻人。他们的年纪，最大不过二十八岁，最小的还不满二十岁。就是他们，在今年建造又一艘五千吨海轮“和平58号”的斗争中，再一次创造了九天九夜完成船台周期舾装工程的奇迹。
    神圣的诺言
    8月初，江南造船厂党委向全厂工人宣布了建造“和平58号”海轮的消息以后不久，党的八届八中全会公报和决议公布了。工人们说：“国家大计划要提前，我们的小计划首先要提前。”他们把原来提出的，以比去年建造“和平28号”提前四十天完成船台周期的保证，再压缩到三十五天。他们认为，造船速度一定要越造越快，质量一定要越造越好；去年“和平28号”是七十天的船台周期，今年如果还是保持这个速度，就算不上继续跃进。他们说，“要叫时间听从我们造船工人的命令！”就这样，“和平58号”的船台大合拢，神话般地飞速前进。船体车间以比去年快二十二天的速度，完成焊装船体的工程以后，竞赛的接力棒就传到了舾装车间邬显康青年钳工小组的同志们的手里了。
    以三十五天完成海轮的船台周期，除了焊装船体的工程以外，关键就在海轮的主机轴系定位、拉线照光以及安装推进器、舵系等舾装工程了。现在，担任这个工程的邬显康青年小组，以什么样的速度前进呢？
    一个星期天的清晨，小组长邬显康骑着脚踏车疾驰在街头，从热被窝里、从厨房里、从理发店里，把小组的同志一个个请到自己家里，讨论怎样继续跃进。
    他们决议：向党委保证，用十天十夜的时间，完成这次船台周期的舾装工程。
    于是，一场力争高速度的战斗，在他们小组里展开了。
    9月12日深夜。船台上，蓝色的电焊弧光划破天空，起重机豪迈地挥舞着手臂，四周充满震耳的“达达”声和重磅鎯头敲击钢板的铿锵声……上道工序船体车间还在紧张地焊装船体，邬显康青年小组已经开始了为尾轴拉线的工作。在一条四十多米长的地轴棚里，几个人好不容易把一条又长又细的钢丝，从东到西拉直了。但是，船体震动得厉害，两头的位置老对不准；电焊火花溅到钢丝上，又一连爆断了两根。有人说：“看来，不等焊接工程完工，是无法进行下去了。”不对，第二天几个人提早上船，把准备工作做好，等到半夜三点钟，乘人们放下手里的工作下船吃饭的时候，突击拉线。时间一分钟、五分钟、二十分钟过去了，吃饭的人们陆续来了，突然，贯通四十多米长的临时电话坏了，东西两头发出的口令无法传出。这简直同在前线战斗的紧急关头突然断了电话联系一样。这时，组员们迅速地像一条长蛇似地排在长长的通道上，组成了一个“活电话”，大声地用嘴巴继续向后传口令：“向左！”“向右！”批凿枪震耳的“达达”声又响起来。组员们看着那根已经拉得又准又直的钢丝笑了，他们比去年缩短了三十六个小时就完成了拉线工作。
    邬显康青年小组带着赢得时间的第一个胜利，跨入第二道工序，为七号隔舱钻十二只眼子。他们又屈指一算：采用去年在“和平28号”上用冷风钻钻眼子的方法，依然要花三十六个小时，这就不可能实现十天完成舾装工程的速度。以十天的最后一天为起点来推算，只允许用十二个小时完成这道工序。于是，有人说了：“在船上钻眼子，一向用冷风钻；时间又不是靠推算就能缩短的，有什么办法呢？”新的困难和矛盾又出现了。
    十天，这是一个神圣的诺言。邬显康青年小组的同志们下定决心，天塌下来也要实现它。
    甲板上，秋风送来一阵阵寒意。小组同志们的心却是火热的。他们一连讨论了三次，坚持寻找在十二个小时内完工的新方法。他们考虑，如果把船上的地轴棚搬到车间里，用钻床钻眼子，一个小时就能钻好一只眼子。因为钻床上的夹具合适，不像冷风枪那样活络，不必花很多时间去反复校正。但是，地轴棚就像个下水道那样，怎么能搬到车间里去呢？……
    组员李庆生这时并不做这项工作，组长是分配他做另外的工作的。对于全组的这样一件大事，他却是时刻关注着。他的爱人是一个螺丝厂的工人，熟悉钻眼技术。深夜，他回到家里，就和爱人商量小组的大事。第二天一下了班，李庆生就和小组的同志一起，根据钻床上的夹具原理，改进了冷风钻上的靠模。这就等于在打机关枪的时候，装上个固定的架子，枪身就不会歪了。这个改进，大大节省了钻眼校正的时间。只用八个小时零五十分钟，就是说，比去年缩短了二十七个小时零十分钟的时间，就完成了钻十二只眼子的工作，而且质量比用原来的操作方法更好。
    船台上的日日夜夜
    生产进度牌上的前几道工序记录，已经一笔笔地勾消了；距离轮船下水的日期愈近，青年小组同志们就愈是奋不顾身地抓紧时间，利用时间，一步紧跟一步，一环紧扣一环。这时，他们已经不是按照小时，而是按照分钟来计算工程的进度了。
    起重机把一个二千多公斤重的巨大的轴管慢慢地拉进了船舱，最后还剩下像一本普通的练习簿子那样薄的距离，怎么也拉不进去。有人建议：在外面装个撑脚，用油泵顶进去。“不行！”青年小组的同志们不赞成这个办法，那起码要花一整天的时间。于是，六个人用绳子拖着一个三百公斤的巨型鎯头，使尽全身力气，把高大的轴管敲进去。三百公斤，多么重！年青人的手臂，究竟和起重机的钢臂不一样，一个个汗如雨下，嘴里不住冒热气……三十分钟以后，距离拉拢了。
    安装螺旋桨需要用一块巨大的、坚实的橡皮塞住空隙，不让江水流进去。为了找到一块这样合适的橡皮，整个晚上，组员们在船台和仓库之间的路上，不是走而是奔跑，看上去就像一场百米赛跑似的，橡皮找到了，又太大，必须用锋利的刀，才能把这块比牛皮坚韧得多的橡皮切开。可是，夜深了，到哪里去找？于是，人们身边的小洋刀，切牛肉的刀，敲钢板的鎯头……一起用上。橡皮再坚韧，也比不上这些年青人的意志，终于被切开了。
    安装尾轴，是一道十分复杂的工序。青年小组的同志们一连几昼夜没下船台，组长邬显康熬得眼睛满是红丝。但是，他生怕被同志们、被领导看见，而拉他下阵休息。他偷偷地借了一副黑色的眼镜戴起来，使别人看不到他的红眼睛。可是，船舱里已经够暗的了，这时候，周围并没有刺眼的亮光，为什么要戴黑眼镜呢？秘密被大家拆穿了。党分支书记和小组的同志们关切地劝他回去休息。他却怎么也不答应，他说：“现在正是节骨眼的时候，你们看，我能定下心来睡觉吗？”
    9月21日后半夜，离开轮船下水的时候还有一天一夜。离开邬显康青年小组保证交船的十天时间还有一天一夜。小组的同志们正进行着轮船下水前舾装工程的最后工作：安装舵系。
    黄浦江边显得比往日寂静，甲板上只有几条粗大的水龙带冲射着自来水的哗哗声。这是人们为了准备轮船下水进行的冲洗等工作。水，淌进了像亭子间那么小的舵机舱，一分一分地增高起来，足足有一尺深。可是，安装舵系的工作必需在舱底进行。“那有什么，就踩着水干嘛！”负责装舵的组员朱瑞棋好像不曾想到这水会和自己有什么关系。他三下两下挽起裤脚，脱掉鞋子，“嚓嚓”地大步跨入水中。
    天有些蒙蒙亮了，寒冷的晨风掠过江面，从高大的轮船上端卷下来，有人把棉大衣也穿上了。这时，江潮又涨了起来，渗进了轮机舱，舱里的水又一分一分地向上涨，已经没过膝盖，淹过大腿了。同志们在舱外向朱瑞棋大声叫喊：“等天亮，潮水退了再工作吧。”朱瑞棋把手一挥说：“最后一道关口的钥匙就捏在我手里了，我慢一分钟，计划就拖一分钟！”在这样有着高度责任感的人面前，寒风和冷水，怎么阻挡得了他们的热情？朱瑞棋就这样，穿着单衣，半个身体浸在水里，双手迅速地操作着，一直坚持战斗到最后。
    就是这个清晨，在寒风中，在潮水中，邬显康青年小组全部完成了船台周期中的舾装工程。所花的时间是九天九夜，比他们向党委的保证提前了一天一夜，比去年在“和平28号”上同样工程所花的时间提前了五天五夜。他们胜利地实现了自己向党许下的诺言。
    如果有人问：“和平58号”五千吨海轮三十五天下水，比去年“和平28号”又缩短了三十五天的奇迹，是怎样产生的？”那么，请你仔细地看看邬显康青年小组的这些同志们吧！在江南造船厂，有成千上百个这样的小组。他们都像邬显康青年小组那样，从每一个部件，每一道工序，每一个操作中，用自己的整个身心，去战胜困难，大胆创造，不知疲倦。因此，他们赢得了时间，赢得了胜利。在这里，“分秒必争”这个名词，丝毫也不是什么抽象的口号或概念，这是全厂上万个工人热烈拥护党的总路线，响应党的继续跃进号召的意志力量的表现。这是全厂上万工人为着更加幸福的明天，为着高速度发展祖国造船事业的意志力量的表现。在这里，人们豪迈地说：“要叫每一分钟，每一秒钟的时间，在我们的手里，做出五倍、十倍、一百倍的事情！”邬显康青年钳工小组就是这样，在今年一年中，曾经先后为“金陵号”、“江苏号”等五条船安装轴系工程，都是一条比一条快，一条比一条好。
    今天，这个具有悠久历史的江南造船厂，到处洋溢着青春活力。他们的决心是，创造更新的纪录，用比去年更高的速度，完成建造“和平58号”的全部工程。现在，“和平58号”的锅炉已经生火了，为了向全国群英大会献礼，全厂工人在厂党委领导下，再提出保证：决心用四个月左右的时间，就是说，比“和平28号”再快一个多月的时间，来完成“和平58号”的全部工程，用新的胜利，为祖国的造船事业增添新的光彩。
