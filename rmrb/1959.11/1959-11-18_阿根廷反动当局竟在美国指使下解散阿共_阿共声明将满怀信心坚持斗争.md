Xinhua News Agency, November 17th News: Buenos Aires Report: The Central Committee of the Argentine Communist Party recently issued a statement regarding the government's actions to disqualify the Communist Party and the Justicialist Party from elections and dissolve the two parties. The statement pointed out that the suppression of the Communist Party was carried out under the direction of agents of U.S. monopoly capital. While suppressing the Communist Party, the government signed an oil contract with Mobil Oil Company. The statement said that this action by the government is a direct consequence of violating the promises of the democratic and progressive program made to the people during the presidential election held on February 23, 1958. The statement pointed out that the reactionary forces are depriving Communists and Peronists of their right to vote and plan to implement open dictatorship, with the aim of stifling the movement of workers, peasants, and the people to defend the national economy and national sovereignty, in order to implement the IMF's policies of hunger and surrender to the end. The statement emphasized that "the purpose of the reactionaries is not only to attack the legitimate rights of Communists and Peronists, but also to attempt to attack the rights of all democrats and patriots without exception." The statement said that therefore, the current task of conscious democrats and patriots "is to work together to block the path to the establishment of an open dictatorship." The statement pointed out that the reactionaries are concentrating their fire on the Communists because they are the vanguard in the above-mentioned struggle; the reactionaries are trying to isolate the Communist Party from the masses. The statement pointed out that the reactionaries cannot isolate a party that originated from the masses. "Therefore, our party will continue to act with full confidence in victory under any circumstances."

    阿根廷反动当局竟在美国指使下解散阿共
    阿共声明将满怀信心坚持斗争
    据新华社17日讯　布宜诺斯艾利斯消息：阿根廷共产党中央委员会最近就政府采取的取消共产党和正义党选举资格和解散这两个党的行动发表声明。声明指出，镇压共产党是在美国垄断资本的代理人的指使下进行的。在镇压共产党的同时，政府在同美孚油公司签订石油合同。声明说，政府的这个行动是违背1958年2月23日举行总统选举时向人民许下的民主和进步纲领的诺言的直接后果。声明指出，反动势力剥夺共产党人和庇隆分子的选举权和打算实行公开的独裁，目的是要扼杀工人、农民和人民保卫民族经济和国家主权的运动，以便把国际货币基金组织的饥饿和投降政策执行到底。声明强调指出，“反动派的目的不仅仅是向共产党人和庇隆分子的合法权利进攻，而且是企图毫无例外地向一切民主和爱国人士的权利进攻。”声明说，因此，有觉悟的民主人士和爱国者目前的任务“是共同努力，堵塞建立公开的独裁政权的道路”。声明指出，反动派集中火力攻击共产党人，是因为他们是上述斗争中的先锋队；反动派力图使共产党在群众中陷于孤立。声明指出：反动派不可能使一个在群众中产生的党孤立起来。“因此，我们党将在任何条件下满怀胜利信心地继续行动”。
