    Red Flag Port
    Du Jianfu, Director of Xinxiang Dispatch Station, Zhengzhou Railway Bureau
    The Xinxiang dispatch district is located on the Beijing-Guangzhou Railway Line, governing the area from Guangwu in the south to Anyang in the north, connecting with the Beijing Bureau's jurisdiction. It is the throat for the Zhengzhou Bureau's heavy-laden trains heading south and empty trains heading north, and a major thoroughfare for transporting coking coal for steelmaking. The characteristic of dispatching operations is "loading less than unloading, emptying more than loading." This means that the task of loading trains is smaller than the task of unloading trains, and the task of emptying trains is greater than the task of loading trains. Under these circumstances, the Xinxiang Dispatch Station, responsible for the transportation command work in the Xinxiang district, resolutely implements the principle of "the whole country as one chessboard," first completing the task of emptying trains, while also fully tapping internal potential, striving to complete the district's loading tasks, and achieving relatively significant results. Since the establishment of the station in August of last year, it has basically completed the key material transportation tasks of various periods, and various production and technical indicators have steadily increased. The Anyang port, bordering the Beijing Bureau, has won the honorary title of "Red Flag Port" awarded by the Ministry of Railways.
    Through continuous learning, we first clarified that the whole country is one chessboard, and the entire railway system is also one chessboard. Correctly handling the relationship between the overall situation and the local situation, firmly establishing the idea of local subordination to the overall situation, and strictly acting in accordance with the Party's policies and national plans are the fundamental guarantees for comprehensively completing the railway transportation plan. The dispatch station shoulders the important mission of coordinating transportation between departments, districts, and bureaus. Only by truly implementing the principle of "the whole country as one chessboard" can dispatch commanders be considered to have fulfilled their due responsibilities and be able to do their work well. We believe that the main content of specifically implementing the principle of "the whole country as one chessboard" in dispatch command work is to resolutely implement the transportation policy of taking coal as the key, ensuring key points, and taking care of general needs, first ensuring the loading and transportation of coal; resolutely implementing the transportation principle of "first unloading, second emptying, third receiving, and fourth loading," providing neighboring bureaus with sufficient empty cars according to plan to ensure the loading of key goods; doing a good job at the boundary stations with neighboring bureaus and districts, first of all doing a good job at the Anyang port bordering the Beijing Bureau, receiving as many cars as there are, ensuring smooth flow of trains at the boundary station; when necessary, sharing the difficulties of neighboring bureaus and districts as much as possible, and doing a good job of communist cooperation; and, on the premise of the local situation being subordinate to the overall situation, giving full play to subjective initiative to ensure the completion of one's own transportation plan.
    Of course, in implementing the principle of "the whole country as one chessboard," we also encountered many ideological obstacles. Some believe that emptying trains is "taking a loss," that "giving convenience to others makes things difficult for oneself," that "squabbling and arguing at the boundary station is inevitable," that "two bureaus, two minds, cannot be twisted into one rope"; some say, "how much comes from the south, how much is emptied to the north, if it doesn't come from the south, it's not emptied to the north," believing that "one cannot dig into one's own reserves for others." In order to eliminate these ideological obstacles, we organized the masses to study relevant documents, launched a great airing of views, a great debate, checked and criticized various erroneous ideas and practices, liquidated all kinds of bourgeois individualism and departmentalism, gradually clarified the relationship between the overall situation and the local situation, established the communist ideology of "knowing the big picture and taking care of the overall situation," and cultivated the communist style of "being strict with oneself and generous to others, sacrificing oneself for the group."
    After unifying our thinking, we adopted methods such as paying visits, proactively conducting self-criticism, holding cooperation meetings, offering guarantees, making proposals, and proactively uniting with the other party to greatly promote contact and cooperation with neighboring bureaus and districts. For example, in order to improve relations with the neighboring bureau, we proactively proposed and jointly held a boundary port cooperation meeting with the Handan Dispatch District and Anyang Station. The two sides mutually checked shortcomings and proactively offered their own guarantees, supporting each other in the spirit of "sending charcoal in the snow," thoroughly transforming the departmentalist attitude of "each sweeping the snow from their own doorstep." After consultation, six guarantees were formulated, and a joint proposal was made to all boundary ports across the country to do a good job in communist great cooperation, thereby greatly strengthening internal and external cooperation.
    In actual work, our slogan is: national interests are above all else, leave convenience to brother bureaus, and leave difficulties to ourselves. In order to resolutely guarantee the emptying of the north port, we are willing to sacrifice loading within our jurisdiction. Several times this year, we have pulled back entire trains of empty cars preparing to load coal in Jiaozuo and Hebi to empty them northward, and even re-unloaded heavy trains that were already half-loaded. In order to continuously receive trains from the Anyang port, our slogan is: "Those who come are not refused." When there are not enough locomotives, we will connect the trains and keep them at intermediate stations, organize locomotives to turn around, and connect to continuing southbound trains. Although this increases the difficulty of work within the jurisdiction and causes a decline in individual indicators, it ensures the normal operation of the Beijing Bureau's trains. In order to share the difficulties of the Zhengzhou hub's operations, we often proactively request to receive mixed trains, sort them out at Xinxiang and Anyang stations, and then dispatch them to the north port. According to March statistics, we received 123 mixed trains from the south port, of which 114 were delivered to the Beijing Bureau after sorting. By doing this, we are not actually "taking a loss," but supporting others and exchanging it for a lot of support from others. The Handan Dispatch Station is very concerned about us. When we encounter difficulties in our work, they proactively organize locomotives to pass through the section and proactively request to take our trains that are not sorted in order, giving us great help in our work.
    The masses are the source of strength for doing all work well. In order to earnestly implement the principle of "the whole country as one chessboard" in practical work, it is necessary to mobilize the masses. For a long time, we lacked a correct understanding of dispatch command work, blindly believed in the role of administrative orders, and did not see the power of the masses. As a result, dispatch command work was divorced from politics, divorced from reality, and divorced from the masses. Under the promotion of the Great Leap Forward, our thinking began to change, and we gradually clarified the relationship between dispatch command and on-site labor, resolved the question of whether dispatch command work should vigorously carry out mass movements, and initially implemented the principle of combining centralized leadership with mass movements proposed by the Party. Dispatchers often go deep into the field and establish a close relationship with workers. As a result, they exchange ideas, promote each other, deepen relations, and improve their work. For example, some workers suggested to us: "When you make plans, don't ask us to wait for signals at the 559 meeting station, because it is an uphill road, and it is easy to rush uphill if we start again after waiting for the signal." Such opinions gave us great inspiration. Some dispatchers said: "When we make plans on weekdays, we draw black lines on white paper, and we don't care whether it's uphill or downhill. No wonder the masses have opinions about us, and no wonder the plans can't be fulfilled." At the same time, in going deep among the masses, we also educate the masses on "the whole country as one chessboard," making the idea of "the whole country as one chessboard" a common action of all employees. The workers have guaranteed: "As long as it is to support the neighboring bureau, as long as it is a train to the Anyang port, we will sort it out if we are asked to sort it out, and we will empty it if we are asked to empty it, and we will never delay for a second." Therefore, as soon as they hear that it is an empty train to Anyang, they immediately take action, and a "four quick" situation emerges: quick unloading, quick marshalling, quick inspection, and quick running of the train. The employees of Anyang Station said, "There is a treasure in railway pioneers, and doing a good job in cooperation is the most important; as long as cooperation can be done well, the power is infinite."
    In order to do a good job at the Anyang port bordering the Beijing Bureau, we also jointly formulated a "seven unifications" system with the Handan Dispatch Station: unifying thinking, unifying shifts, unifying indicators, unifying plans, unifying situations, unifying competition and evaluation, and unifying inspection and summary, taking the cooperation between each other one step further to a higher level of form. For example, we organized the three shifts of duty personnel from Xinxiang, Handan, Anyang Station, and the locomotive turnaround section into a large joint labor organization, unifying the shifts, and taking the indicators of the Xinxiang and Handan dispatch stations as the common tasks of both sides, mobilizing all personnel to guarantee the completion of the work by shift, month, ten-day period, and day. This makes the actions of both sides more coordinated and effective.
    In implementing the principle of "the whole country as one chessboard," we also criticized the idea of using the excuse of taking care of the overall situation without making efforts to complete the tasks of the "small bureau," emphasizing giving play to subjective initiative and fully tapping potential, both subordinating to the overall situation and trying every means to complete the tasks of the small bureau. We often mobilize the masses to vigorously grasp unloading, rush loading and unloading, guarantee emptying, and guarantee loading. For example, in August of this year, the south port delivered 5,188 fewer empty cars to us than planned, but because we vigorously grasped unloading, we made up for 2,696 cars. On August 26, the south port planned to send 700 empty cars, but 124 were not delivered. However, because we rushed loading and unloading, we not only overfulfilled the emptying task for the day by 100%, but also completed 103% of the planned loading. Facts have taught us: things are done by people, people can conquer nature, the overall situation and the local situation are not only not contradictory in terms of long-term interests, but can also be unified by giving full play to people's subjective initiative in the current situation.

    红旗口
    郑州铁路局新乡调度所主任　杜建甫
    新乡调度区位于京广线，管辖范围南自广武，北到安阳与北京局辖区衔接，是郑州局重车南下，空车北上的咽喉地带和调运炼钢焦煤的通衢要道。调度作业的特点是：“装大于卸，排大于装”。这就是说，装车的任务大于卸车的任务，排空的任务又大于装车的任务。在这种情况下，负责新乡区运输指挥工作的新乡调度所坚决贯彻“全国一盘棋”的方针，首先完成排空任务，同时充分挖掘内部潜力，力争完成本区的装车任务，取得了比较显著的成绩。自去年8月建所到现在，基本上完成了各个时期的重点物资运输任务，各项生产、技术指标稳步上升。同北京局交界的安阳口荣获铁道部授予的“红旗口”的光荣称号。
    我们通过不断的学习，首先明确了全国是一盘棋，全路也是一盘棋，正确的处理大局与小局的关系，坚定的树立局部服从整体的思想，严格按照党的政策和国家计划办事，是全面完成铁路运输计划的根本保证。调度所担负着部门与部门、区与区、局与局之间的协调运输工作的重大使命，只有切实贯彻执行了“全国一盘棋”的方针，调度指挥人员才算是尽到了应尽的职责，才有可能把工作作好。我们认为在调度指挥工作中具体执行“全国一盘棋”的方针的主要内容是坚决执行以煤为纲，保证重点，照顾一般的运输政策，首先保证煤的装车和运输；坚决执行“一卸二排三接四装车”的运输原则，按计划供给邻局足够的空车，以确保重点货物的装车；搞好与邻局、邻区分界站的工作，首先是搞好与北京局交界的安阳口的工作，有多少车便接多少车，保证分界站列车畅通无阻；必要的时候，尽可能地分担邻局、邻区的困难，搞好共产主义协作；在小局服从大局的前提下，充分发挥主观能动性，保证完成自己的运输计划。
    当然，在贯彻“全国一盘棋”的方针中，也遇到不少思想障碍。有的认为排空是“吃亏”，“方便给了别人，为难了自己”，“分界站上扯皮、顶牛是免不了的”，“两个局、两条心，没法拧成一股绳”；有的说，“南来多少，北排多少，南不来，北不排”，认为“不能为别人挖自己的老底子”。为了扫除这些思想障碍，我们组织群众学习有关文件，开展了大鸣大放大辩论，检查批判了种种错误思想和作法，清算了形形色色的资产阶级个人主义和本位主义，逐步明确了大局和小局的关系，树立了“识大体，顾大局”的共产主义思想，培养了“克己宽人，舍己为群”的共产主义风格。
    统一了思想认识以后，我们采取了登门拜访，主动检讨，开协作会，提保证，搞倡议，主动团结对方等办法，大大促进了与邻局、邻区的联系配合。例如为了搞好与邻局的关系，我们主动倡议，与邯郸调度区和安阳车站共同举行了分界口协作会议，双方互相检查缺点，主动提出自己的保证，以“雪中送炭”的精神互相支援，彻底转变“各人自扫门前雪”的本位主义态度。经过协商，制订了六条保证，并联名向全国各分界口提出了搞好共产主义大协作的倡议书，从而大大加强了内外之间的协作。
    在实际工作中，我们的口号是：国家利益高于一切，把方便留给兄弟局，把困难留给自己。为了坚决保证北口排空，牺牲管内装车，也在所不惜。今年好几次都把整列送往焦作、鹤壁准备装煤的空车拉回来向北排空，甚至将已经装了一半的重车重新卸下。为了从安阳口不间断的接入列车，我们的口号是：“来者不拒”，机车不足时，就将列车接入，保留在中间站上，组织机车折返，接入继续到达的南下列车。这样作虽然增加了管内工作上的困难，并造成个别指标下降，但保证了北京局的列车正常运行。为了分担郑州枢纽作业上的困难，我们常常主动要求接入混编列车，在新乡、安阳车站整编后，再向北口排出，据3月份的统计，我们从南口接入的混编列车达一百二十三列，其中经过整编之后，交出北京局的便达一百一十四列。我们这样做，事实并没有“吃亏”，而是支援别人，也换来了别人的大量支援。邯郸调度所对我们是十分关怀的。当我们在工作中遇到困难的时候，他们便主动组织机车过段，主动要求接我们整编不顺序的列车，给我们工作上以极大的帮助。
    群众是作好一切工作的力量源泉。在实际工作中认真执行“全国一盘棋”的方针，必须把群众发动起来。长期以来，我们对调度指挥工作缺乏正确认识，迷信行政命令的作用，看不到群众的威力。结果，使调度指挥工作脱离政治、脱离实际、脱离群众。在大跃进的形势促进下，我们的思想开始发生变化，逐步明确了调度指挥和现场劳动之间的关系，解决了调度指挥工作要不要大搞群众运动的问题，初步贯彻执行了党所提出的集中领导与群众运动相结合的方针。调度人员经常深入现场同工人建立起亲如手足的关系。其结果，互相交心，互相促进，密切了关系，改进了工作。例如，有的工人向我们提意见说：“你们作计划时，千万不要叫我们在559会让站等牌，因为那里是个上坡道，一等牌再起动就容易闯坡”。诸如此类的意见给我们很大的启发。有的调度员说：“我们平日作计划，白纸面上划黑道，哪管它上坡下坡，难怪群众对我们有意见，难怪计划老是不能兑现”。同时，在深入群众中我们也对群众进行“全国一盘棋”的教育，使“全国一盘棋”的思想成为全体职工的共同行动。工人们纷纷保证：“只要为了支援邻局，只要是去安阳口的列车，叫整编就整编，叫排空就排空，决不耽误分秒”。因而他们一听到是开往安阳的排空车，就立即行动，出现卸车快、编组快、检车快、拉着列车跑得快的“四快”局面，安阳车站的职工说，“铁路先行有一宝，搞好协作最重要；只要协作能搞好，力量无穷用不了。”
    为了搞好同北京局交界的安阳口的工作，我们还同邯郸调度所制定了统一思想，统一班次，统一指标，统一计划，统一情况，统一竞赛评比，统一检查总结的“七统一”制度，把彼此之间的协作向高一级的形式发展了一步。例如，我们把新乡、邯郸、安阳站和机务折返段的三班值勤人员组织成一个大的联合劳动组织，统一了班次，又把新乡、邯郸两个调度所的指标作为双方的共同任务，发动全体人员按班、按月、按旬、按日保证完成。这样就使双方的动作更协调，更有效。
    在贯彻“全国一盘棋”的方针中，我们还批判了借口顾全大局而不努力完成“小局”任务的思想，强调发挥主观能动性，充分挖掘潜力，既要服从大局，也要千方百计完成小局的任务。我们经常发动群众大抓卸车，抢装抢卸，保证排空，保证装车。例如，今年8月份南口按计划少交给我们五千一百八十八辆空车，但是由于我们大抓卸车，就补上了二千六百九十六辆。8月26日，南口计划来七百辆空车，落空了一百二十四辆，但是由于我们抢装抢卸，不仅超额100％完成了当天的排空任务，而且装车也完成了计划的103％。事实教育了我们：事在人为，人定胜天，大局和小局不仅从长远利益上说是并不矛盾的，就是在当前情况下，也可以通过充分发挥人的主观能动性得到统一。
