    Only When a Myriad of Purples and Reds Bloom Is It Truly Spring
    The Responsibility of a Communist Party Member
    Helping others is the responsibility of a Communist Party member. Everyone working together is always more effective than one or two people working alone. If only I plant red flags, I'll be exhausted to death and still won't build socialism.
        He Gouhao,
        Advanced Producer, Planing Worker, Shanxi Machine Tool Factory
    Helping Others is a Kind of Happiness
    One flower cannot make a spring. Helping others is a kind of happiness. Because only when everyone completes the Party's tasks together can we achieve victory in our collective endeavors.
    Wu Lianghu, Foreman, Wuhan Jiang'an Vehicle Factory
    The Party is the Sun...
    The Party is the sun, nurturing our growth. Without the Party, we would have no soul, no direction.
    A person is like a fish, and the masses are the water. A fish without water loses its vitality.
        Zhan Shuijing,
        Special-Class Labor Model of Lüda City, Dalian Shipyard
    "Leading" and "Helping"
    A few days ago, the Shijiazhuang Daily published news about Wang Xinnian, a national advanced producer from the Shijiazhuang Freight Car Factory, going to work in a backward team. He enthusiastically helped the backward team reach his level. This is a valuable communist style. This valuable thought and action shows that he regards his own advanced experience as everyone's wealth, prioritizing collective interests. Comrade Wang Xinnian said it well: "Not completing an individual plan only affects one person, but if all sixty-five people in the entire team become advanced, it's a hundred times more effective than me alone!"
    There are two main ways to rapidly raise the level of advanced producers to the level of the entire society: on the one hand, backward individuals must have great ambition, set high goals, exert great effort, strive to move up, humbly learn from the advanced, catch up with the advanced, and surpass the advanced; on the other hand, advanced producers must not be arrogant or complacent, and in addition to working a hundred times harder themselves and always being advanced, they must also enthusiastically help those who are lagging behind to catch up to the level of advanced producers. As the saying goes, "One skillful hand is not as good as a hundred skillful hands." The principle is very simple. As an advanced producer, your responsibilities are of course greater and heavier than those of ordinary people and those who are lagging behind. This responsibility is to help and lead those who are lagging behind, even if it takes some time and your individual plans may be temporarily affected; but this "loss" is only a loss of one or two ounces compared to the benefits that the collective's achievement of an advanced level brings to the country. People with communist ideals would rather have the collective's "hundred pounds" than the individual's "one or two ounces."
    We can find many similar examples of Comrade Wang Xinnian's enthusiastic communist style of leading and helping others at the recent National Conference of Heroes. An advanced producer should not only have advanced production technology, but also advanced thinking. Not regarding one's own advanced technology as personal property, but regarding it as social property. This is precisely the difference between us and bourgeois elements. Our social production will only improve when the production level of a few advanced individuals is transformed into the production level of the entire society. Only in this way can socialism be built at an early date. They are the "pioneers of the forward development of human history"!
                  Bai Linmao, Shijiazhuang, Hebei
    Common Improvement
    There is a common idea in our team: building socialism requires everyone to work together, and it requires teams to improve together. Therefore, we are always happy to help other teams, to work with teams with low efficiency, and to move forward together. If anyone shows a little unwillingness, they will immediately be criticized by the whole team. Once, our team was pouring concrete floor slabs with a team that often failed to meet its quota. One team member casually said, "This time, we can forget about exceeding our quota!" As soon as he said the words, he was criticized by everyone: "Everyone is building, why divide yours and mine? If it's just for a few dollars, what's the point of working!" He himself immediately felt that he was wrong and accepted everyone's criticism. Our team cooperated very well with them. In the work, our team and they calculated wages together, and no one complained, everyone was in high spirits. It was in this kind of mutual help and cooperation that the production task was overfulfilled. The efficiency of their team quickly improved. Isn't this much better than our team working alone?
          Lin You, Captain of the Lin You Concrete Team, Guangzhou
    Good at Grafting the Strengths of Others to Cover Our Own Shortcomings
    Two gardeners were cultivating apples. Gardener A believed that delicious, large apples were naturally grown to be big and sweet, and that unappetizing, small apples were naturally small and bitter.
    Gardener B, on the other hand, grafted the small and bitter apples onto the good apples, and as a result, the apples that grew were bigger and sweeter than the original good apples.
    Advanced producers and advanced workers are models for the people and vanguards in building socialism. Those who are good at grafting their strengths and covering their own shortcomings will quickly catch up with them, surpass them, and become new advanced producers and advanced workers; those who believe that advanced producers and advanced workers are born legendary heroes, and who have always looked down on themselves, will gradually become smaller and more bitter, like Gardener A's small apples.
      Han Mingjie, Handan Urban Construction Bureau

    万紫千红才是春
    共产党员的责任
    帮助别人是共产党员的责任。大家干起来，总比一两个人干的效果好。只有我一个人插红旗，累死了也建不成社会主义。

    帮助别人是一种幸福
    一朵花打扮不出春天来。帮助别人是一种幸福。因为只有大家一起完成党的任务，才能取得集体事业的胜利。

    党是太阳………
    党是太阳，抚育我们生长，没有党，我们就没有灵魂，没有方向。
    一个人好比一条鱼，群众就是水，鱼要离了水，就失去了生命力。

    “带”和“帮”
    前几天石家庄日报刊登了全国先进生产者、石家庄货车工厂王新年到落后组去工作的消息。他热情地帮助落后组的水平达到了自己的水平。这是可贵的共产主义风格。这种可贵的思想和行动说明了：他把自己摸索到的先进经验视为大家的财富，以集体利益为重。王新年同志说的好：“个人计划完不成只是一个人，如果整个组六十五人都先进了，比自己效率高强百倍啊！”。
    把先进生产者的水平迅速提高为全社会的水平，不外乎有二方面：一方面是后进者要树雄心，立大志，大鼓干劲、力争上游、虚心学先进、赶先进、超先进；另一方面先进生产者必须不骄不躁，除了自己更百倍地努力，永远先进外，还要热情地帮助落后者赶上先进生产者的水平。俗语说：“一双手巧不如百双手巧”。道理是很简单的。作为先进生产者的责任，当然要比一般人和后进者大一些，重一些。这责任就是要帮助和带动后进者，即使这样会花费一些时间，个人的计划可能暂时受到一些影响；但这“损失”比起在集体达到先进水平后给国家带来的好处，只不过是得百斤而失一两。有着共产主义思想的人，是宁要这集体的“百斤”，而不要这个人的“一两”的。
    王新年同志这种热心带动和帮助别人的共产主义风格，我们在最近召开的全国群英会上可以找到很多同样的例子。一个先进生产者，不仅是自己的生产技术先进，而且应该是思想先进的。不把自己的先进技术视为个人的财产，而把它视为社会的财产。这正是我们和资产阶级分子不同之处。我们的社会生产，只有把少数先进者的生产水平，变成为全社会的生产水平时，才会提高。唯有这样，社会主义才能早日建成。他们是“人类历史向前发展的先驱”！

    共同提高
    我们队里有一个共同的思想：建设社会主义要大家一齐干，要队队共同提高才行。所以，我们总是很乐意去帮助别的队，和工效低的队一起干，共同前进。如果有谁流露一点不大愿意的情绪，他立刻就会遭到全队的批评。有一次，我们队和一个经常完不成定额的队一起打混凝土楼板。有一个队员随便说了一句：“这一下，我们就不用想再超额了！”他话才说出口，就引起了大家的批评：“大家都搞建设嘛，何必分你的我的。如果光为几个钱，工作还有什么意思呢！”他自己也马上觉得不对，接受了大家的批评。我们队和他们合作得很好，在工作中，我们队和他们合一起计算工资，谁都没有怨言，大家情绪很高。就在这样的互相帮助、共同协作下，生产任务超额完成。他们队的工效，很快就提高了，这不是比我们队单干要好得多吗？

    善于嫁他人之长，接自己之短
    两个培育苹果的园丁。甲认为好吃的大苹果，是长就的又大又甜，难吃的小苹果，是天生的又小又苦。
    而乙则把又小又苦的苹果和好苹果进行了嫁接，结果结出来的苹果比原来的好苹果还大、还甜。
    先进生产者和先进工作者是人民群众的表率，是建设社会主义的急先锋。善于嫁他们之长，接自己之短的人，会很快地赶上他们，超过他们，成为新的先进生产者和先进工作者；认为先进生产者和先进工作者是天生的传奇英雄，而一向藐视自己的人，将会和甲园丁的小苹果一样，慢慢地变得越来越小、越苦。
