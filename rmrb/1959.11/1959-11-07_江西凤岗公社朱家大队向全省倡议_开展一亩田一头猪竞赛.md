Jiangxi Fenggang Commune Zhu Family Brigade Initiates Province-Wide "One Pig Per Mu of Land" Competition

    (From our dispatch) The members of the Zhu Family Brigade of the Fenggang Commune in Nankang County, Jiangxi Province, have a high level of enthusiasm for raising pigs. They plan to achieve the goal of "one pig per mu of land" by March of next year and have initiated a pig-raising and fertilizer accumulation competition to all people's communes in Jiangxi Province. Recently, the Jiangxi Daily published the initiative from all members of the brigade, the full text of which is as follows:

    Dear comrades of all communes in the province:

    In order to fundamentally solve the fertilizer problem in agricultural production, resolve the people's increasing need for meat, and increase the income of the communes and members, all cadres and members of our brigade, under the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and the Fifth Plenary Session (Enlarged) of the Fifth Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee, are exerting full effort and are determined to launch a "one pig per mu of land" movement throughout the brigade, striving to achieve this goal by March 1960. In order to encourage each other and promote production, we are challenging you. We believe that we will receive a warm response from everyone and push our pig-raising事业 to a new height.

    Our brigade began raising pigs on a large scale in the second half of last year. Over the past year, we have deeply felt the great benefits of raising pigs. We believe that achieving the plan of "one pig per mu of land" in March 1960 has many favorable conditions: (1) Everyone recognizes the benefits of raising pigs, and the enthusiasm for raising pigs is high. (2) The source of pigs is not a problem. The brigade retains ninety-four sows. From now until March next year, each sow can produce a litter of piglets. According to our experience, each sow can average nine piglets per litter, for a total of eight hundred and forty-six piglets. Adding the existing four hundred and twenty-five heads, we have one hundred and sixteen more than needed, based on one pig per mu of land. In the future, we will continue to increase. (3) We have cultivated a group of pig-raising experts and have explored a set of experiences in large-scale pig-raising. (4) Due to the even distribution of rainfall, the yield of feed is high. For example, the yield of sweet potatoes this year is equivalent to the yield of two mu of land last year. The feed plots planted by the members themselves have already grown. But there are also some difficulties. To raise more than a thousand pigs, dozens of thousands of jin of plant feed are needed each month, in addition to refined feed. Also, some pig-raising households still lack pigsties, etc. But we are fully confident to overcome these difficulties.

    Our method of achieving this plan is, first, to implement the policy of combining public and private raising, and to implement pig-raising at three levels: the brigade, the mess hall, and individual members. The specific arrangement is: the one hundred and ninety households of members will raise an average of one and a half pigs each, for a total of two hundred and eighty-five pigs (including the current fifty-eight pigs); the mess hall will increase from the existing sixty pigs to two hundred and forty pigs; the rest will be raised centrally by the brigade. Second, the mess hall and the brigade will establish professional teams, reasonably allocate existing feed plots, and allocate a certain feed base. Third, strengthen leadership, and decide that a team leader will specialize in pig-raising, continuously strengthen the political and ideological education of the feeders, and increase the proportion of party and youth league members among the feeders. The three-comparison competition of "raising well, growing fast, and not dying" is often carried out among the feeders, and the democratic life system is improved. At the same time, improve the work measurement method for feeders, and implement a responsibility system of contracting work, contracting production, and rewarding overproduction to stimulate the enthusiasm of the feeders.

    We will do what we say. At present, we have already taken action. Comrades of all communes in the province, we hope that you will regularly supervise our actions. We hope that this movement will develop vigorously, and that prosperous scenes of "pigs full of pens, fertilizer full of fields, plenty of meat to eat, and healthy and happy people" will appear everywhere in a not too long period of time.

    江西凤岗公社朱家大队向全省倡议
    开展一亩田一头猪竞赛
    本报讯　江西南康县凤岗公社朱家大队的社员，养猪积极性很高，他们打算到明年3月实现一亩地一头猪的计划，并向江西省各人民公社倡议开展养猪积肥竞赛。最近江西日报发表了这个大队全体队员的倡议书，全文如下：亲爱的全省各公社社员同志们：
    为了从根本上解决农业生产的肥料问题，解决人民日益增长的肉食，增加公社和社员的收入，我们全大队干部和社员，在党的八届八中全会和省委五届八次（扩大）会议号召下，鼓足干劲，决心在全大队开展一亩田一头猪运动，争取在1960年3月份实现这个计划。为了互相鼓励，促进生产，特向你们挑战。我们相信一定会得到大家的热烈响应，把我们的养猪事业推向更高峰。
    去年下半年起，我们大队就开始大规模地养猪。一年多来，我们深深体会到养猪的好处大。我们认为在1960年3月实现一亩田一头猪的计划，有许多有利条件：（一）大家认识到了养猪的好处，养猪积极性高。（二）猪源不成问题。全大队留有母猪九十四头，从现在起，到明年3月，每头母猪可产猪仔一窝。根据我们的经验，可以作到每头母猪每窝平均猪仔九只，共可产小猪八百四十六只，加上现有四百二十五头，按一亩田一头算，还多一百一十六头，以后还将不断增加。（三）我们培养出了一批养猪手，摸索到一套大规模养猪的经验。（四）由于雨水调匀，饲料产量高，如番薯今年一亩田可顶去年二亩田的产量。社员自种的饲料地已长起来了。但也有些困难，养一千多头猪，除精饲料外，每个月还要几十万斤植物饲料；另外是部分养猪户还缺猪圈等。但我们完全有信心克服这些困难。
    我们实现这个计划的办法，首先是贯彻公私养并举的方针，实行大队、食堂、社员个人三级养猪。具体安排是：一百九十户社员，平均每户养一头半，共养二百八十五头（包括现养五十八头在内）；食堂现有六十头基础上，要增养到二百四十头；其余皆由大队集中饲养。其次，食堂、大队都建立专业队伍，合理分配现有饲料地，并划给一定饲料基地。再次，加强领导，决定由一个队长专门领导养猪，不断加强对饲养员的政治思想教育，增加饲养员中的党、团员成分。在饲养员中经常开展“养得好、长肉快、不死亡”的三比竞赛，健全民主生活制度。与此同时，改进对饲养员的计工方法，实行包工、包产、超产奖励的责任制度，以激发饲养员的积极性。
    我们说到就做到，目前，我们已行动起来了。全省各公社社员们，希望你们经常督促我们的行动，我们愿这个运动蓬勃地开展起来，在不太长的时间内，处处出现“猪满圈、肥满田、吃肉多、人康乐”的繁荣景象。
