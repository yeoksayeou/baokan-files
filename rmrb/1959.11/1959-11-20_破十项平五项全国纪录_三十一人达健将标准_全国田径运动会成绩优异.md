Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, November 19th (Xinhua News Agency reporter Xu Ben, Jiang Shunzhang report): The four-day 1959 National Winter Track and Field Meet concluded on the 18th. This meet was another review of China's track and field movement after the First National Games. The entire process and results of the competition show that this meet was well-organized,精彩 (jing cai - brilliant/wonderful), and achieved a "large-area harvest," further improving the level of China's track and field movement.

In the short four days of competition, twelve male and female athletes broke ten national records sixteen times and equaled five national records six times, including four – men's 100 meters, 110-meter hurdles, women's 80-meter hurdles, and women's pentathlon – creating national bests. In addition, the results of thirty-one athletes reached the master athlete standard, and one hundred and forty-seven athletes reached the level of first-class athletes.

As everyone knows, before 1958, China's national record for the men's 100 meters (10.7 seconds) was still held by Liu Changchun, set in 1933. This record was broken in 1958 by PLA athlete Liang Jianxun with a time of 10.6 seconds. At this National Winter Track and Field Meet, Chen Jiaquan, a twenty-year-old student from Sichuan, created a new national best of 10.5 seconds, causing Liang Jianxun's record of 10.6 seconds to last for only a little over a year. The emergence of this situation is the inevitable result of the widespread development of mass sports activities. Before October of this year, a total of six athletes in the country achieved a 100-meter time of 10.6 seconds, and even more people reached 10.7 seconds.

In the women's 80-meter hurdles competition at this Winter Track and Field Meet, Liu Zheng from Inner Mongolia created a national best of 10.8 seconds, only 0.2 seconds behind the world record; Gao Jiqiao, 22, also approached the 14-second "barrier" with a national best of 14.2 seconds in the men's 110-meter hurdles. These results were improvements over the results they achieved at the First National Games two months ago.

This meet was held under winter conditions. Some people once believed that winter was not suitable for track and field competitions, and good results would not be achieved. However, China's excellent athletes broke this notion with the fact of creating excellent results. They were all vigorous and full of vitality, and "creating a large number of excellent sports results for the motherland" became their common thought. It was precisely with this kind of thinking that they were motivated and exerted their potential, competing for every second in the competition. Gao Jiqiao, a refrigeration worker from the Tianjin First Food Processing Factory who created the national best in the 110-meter hurdles this time, is a prominent example. In the National Games in September, he only won fourth place with a time of 14.7 seconds. Later, he summed up his experience and carried out comprehensive training. Only two months later, in this competition, he continuously improved his results three times. He reached 14.4 seconds in the preliminary round, and then in the final more than an hour later, he created a new record of 14.3 seconds. He was still not satisfied and strived to create even better results. Sure enough, in the subsequent exhibition match, he improved his result to 14.2 seconds. The kind of perseverance that Gao Jiqiao possesses is not unique. None of the athletes who participated in the 10,000-meter race this time gave up halfway, and all of them ran to the finish line. Jiang Yumin, the fastest female runner in China, although injured her leg midway through the 100-meter preliminary, still persisted to the end at a speed of 11.9 seconds, maintaining her original national record.

### 破十项平五项全国纪录　三十一人达健将标准  全国田径运动会成绩优异

    破十项平五项全国纪录　三十一人达健将标准
    全国田径运动会成绩优异
    新华社武汉19日电　新华社记者徐奔、蒋顺章报道：为时四天的1959年全国冬季田径运动会已经在18日结束。这次运动会是继第一届全国运动会之后，对我国田径运动的又一次检阅。比赛的全部过程和结果表明：这次运动会开得好，开得精采，获得了“大面积丰收”，使我国田径运动水平又提高了一步。
    在短短的四天比赛中，有十二名男女选手十六次打破了十项全国纪录、六次平了五项全国纪录，其中有四项——男子一百米、一百一十米高栏，女子八十米低栏和女子五项全能，创造了全国最高成绩。另外，有三十一名选手的成绩达到了运动健将标准，一百四十七名选手达到了一级运动员的水平。
    大家知道，在1958年以前，我国男子一百米的全国纪录（十秒七）还是刘长春在1933年创造的。这个纪录在1958年被解放军选手梁建勋以十秒六的成绩所打破。而在这次全国冬季田径运动会上，四川二十岁的学生陈家全，又创造了十秒五的全国最高成绩，使梁建勋创造的十秒六的纪录只保持了一年多的时间。出现这种情况，是广泛开展群众性体育运动的必然结果。今年10月以前全国共有六名选手百米成绩达到了十秒六的水平，而达到十秒七的人就更多了。
    在这次冬季田径运动会的女子八十米低栏比赛中，内蒙古选手刘正创造了十秒八的全国最高成绩，比世界纪录仅差零点二秒；二十二岁的高济桥在男子一百一十米高栏比赛中创造的十四秒二的全国最高成绩，也逼近了十四秒“大关”。这些成绩都比他们两个月前在第一届全国运动会上创造的成绩有所提高。
    这次运动会，是在已经入冬的条件下举行的。曾经有人认为：冬季不适合田径比赛，比赛也不会创造出好成绩。但是，我国优秀的运动员们却以创造优异成绩的事实，打破了这种说法。他们个个生龙活虎，朝气蓬勃，“为祖国创造大批优秀运动成绩”，成为他们的共同思想，正是具有这种思想，因而他们干劲冲天，发挥潜力，在比赛中分秒必争，你追我赶。这次创造一百一十米高栏全国最高成绩的天津第一食品加工厂冷冻工人高济桥，就是突出的例子。他在9月间的全国运动会上，仅以十四秒七的成绩获得第四名。后来他总结经验，进行全面锻炼，相隔只两个月，在这次比赛中，他连续三次成绩一跃再跃，预赛中达到十四秒四，接着在一个多小时以后的决赛中又创造了十四秒三的新成绩。他仍不满足，力争创造更好的成绩，果然在后来的表演赛中，又把成绩提高到十四秒二。像高济桥这种具有坚韧不拔的毅力并不是独一无二的。这次参加一万米赛跑的运动员，没有一个半途而废的，全部跑到终点。我国跑得最快的女运动员姜玉民，在这次一百米的预赛中，虽然中途腿部受伤，仍然以十一秒九的速度坚持到最后，保持了她原来创造的全国纪录。
