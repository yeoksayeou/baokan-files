Xinhua News Agency, October 31st, TASS, New York, October 30th: The Soviet delegation participating in the 14th session of the United Nations General Assembly issued the following statement to the press regarding the intention to send a permanent United Nations committee to Laos:

　　Recently, Western newspapers have reported that certain groups are brewing the establishment of some kind of permanent committee in Laos. At the same time, some Western news agencies, especially Reuters, are spreading rumors, claiming that the Soviet Union does not intend to oppose sending such a committee to Laos.

　　Therefore, the Soviet delegation participating in the 14th session of the United Nations General Assembly believes it is necessary to state that there is absolutely no question of the Soviet Union supporting or even tacitly approving the use of the United Nations' name to conceal such illegal activities. The Soviet Union has already clarified its attitude towards the recent events in Laos in the corresponding documents issued on August 18th and September 14th, 1959.

　　The tension created in the Laotian region can and should be eliminated based on the 1954 Geneva Accords and within the scope of these accords, as the Geneva Accords are the foundation of peace and security in Indochina. Taking measures that violate the United Nations Charter to establish a so-called Laos problem subcommittee, or sending any permanent United Nations committee to Laos, would mean undermining the Geneva Accords, which would wipe out the main and only legal basis for maintaining peace in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. The initiators of such steps should not forget the serious consequences that such actions would have for the cause of peace in Southeast Asia and the cause of peace throughout the world.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, October 31st: The Information Department of the Vietnamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs distributed a booklet entitled "The Truth About Laos" published by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at a press conference held today. It compiles statements from politicians and newspapers around the world regarding the Laotian situation.

　　This booklet exposes the illegal nature of the United Nations Security Council's dispatch of the "Laos Situation Investigation Subcommittee" to Laos to conduct a so-called "investigation"; refutes the baseless slander made by the Laotian Sananikone government against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam; exposes the U.S. imperialist interference in Laos and the Sananikone reactionary clique's criminal acts in violation of the Geneva Accords as the root cause of the civil war in Laos; it also points out that the only way to normalize the Laotian situation is: the United States must immediately stop interfering in Laos, and the Laotian reactionary clique must immediately stop the civil war and strictly implement the Geneva Accords.

### 苏联出席联大代表团发表声明  反对联合国破坏日内瓦协议  指出派遣常设委员会到老挝去是非法的

    苏联出席联大代表团发表声明
    反对联合国破坏日内瓦协议
    指出派遣常设委员会到老挝去是非法的
    新华社31日讯　塔斯社纽约30日讯：参加第十四届联合国大会会议的苏联代表团就打算派遣联合国常设委员会到老挝一事向报界发表声明如下：
    最近西方报纸上有消息说，某些集团正酝酿在老挝设立一个什么常设委员会。同时，某些西方通讯社，特别是路透社，还散布谣言，说什么苏联不打算反对派遣这种委员会到老挝去。
    因此，参加第十四届联合国大会会议的苏联代表团认为有必要声明，根本谈不到什么苏联会支持，或者竟默许利用联合国名义来掩饰这种非法行为。苏联在1959年8月18日和9月14日发表的相应文件中，已经阐明了苏联对老挝最近发生的事件的态度。
    在老挝地区产生的紧张局势，可能而且应当根据1954年的日内瓦协议，并且在这种协议的范围内加以消除，因为日内瓦协议是印度支那和平与安全的基础。采取违背联合国宪章而建立所谓的老挝问题小组委员会，或者派遣什么联合国常设委员会到老挝去的措施，就意味着破坏日内瓦协议，这样就会把维持越南、老挝和柬埔寨和平的主要和唯一的法律根据一笔勾销。这种步骤的发起人不应当忘记，这种行径会给东南亚的和平事业以及全世界的和平事业造成多么严重的后果。
    新华社河内31日电　越南外交部新闻司在今天举行的记者招待会上，分发了外交部出版的一本“老挝的真相”的小册子。它汇集了世界各国政界人士和报刊关于老挝局势的言论。
    这本小册子揭露了联合国安全理事会派遣“老挝局势调查小组委员会”到老挝进行所谓“调查”的非法性质；驳斥了老挝萨纳尼空政府对越南民主共和国毫无根据的诬蔑；揭露美帝国主义对老挝的干涉和萨纳尼空反动集团违反日内瓦协议的罪恶行为是造成老挝内战的根源；它还指出使老挝局势正常化的唯一途径是：美国立即停止干涉老挝，老挝反动集团立即停止内战，严正履行日内瓦协议。
