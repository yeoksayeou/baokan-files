Xinhua News Agency, November 10th, New York (via TASS): Soviet Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Sobolev, wrote to UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld, responding to Hammarskjöld's letter of November 7th. In his letter, Sobolev said, "The UN Secretary-General's visit to Laos and the planned appointment of the Secretary-General's personal representative to Vientiane, like all other activities undertaken by the UN on this issue, will only further complicate the current situation."

Sobolev said, "All these steps can only be seen as attempts to use the United Nations to cover up certain countries' activities aimed at completely tearing up the Geneva Accords, which cannot but have dangerous consequences for the cause of peace in Southeast Asia and the world."

Sobolev reiterated in his letter that the aggravation of the domestic situation in Laos is the result of the Laotian government's refusal to implement the Geneva and Vientiane agreements. The so-called United Nations Security Council's sub-committee investigating the situation in Laos, in its report, actually admitted this, acknowledging that there was no evidence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam "invading" Laos. Sobolev said, "The Soviet government believes that, in order to normalize the situation in Laos, it is necessary to strictly implement the Geneva Accords, especially to immediately restore the activities of the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Laos."

    索波列夫重申必须执行日内瓦协议
    哈马舍尔德去老挝只会使局势更复杂
    新华社10日讯　据塔斯社纽约10日讯：苏联常驻联合国代表索波列夫写信给联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德，答复哈马舍尔德11月7日写给他的信件。索波列夫在信中说，“联合国秘书长到老挝去和计划指派秘书长的私人代表驻在万象，这同联合国在这个问题上所采取的其他一切活动一样，只会使当前局势更加复杂化。”
    索波列夫说，“所有这些步骤不能看成别的，这正是企图利用联合国来掩盖某些国家目的在于完全撕毁日内瓦协议的活动，这对东南亚和全世界的和平事业不能不产生危险的后果。”
    索波列夫在信中重申，老挝国内局势的尖锐化是老挝政府拒绝执行日内瓦协议和万象协议的结果，所谓的联合国安全理事会调查老挝局势小组委员会，在自己的报告中实际上承认了这一点，承认越南民主共和国“侵略”老挝的证据是不存在的。索波列夫说，“苏联政府认为，为了使老挝局势正常化，有必要严格执行日内瓦协议，特别是立即恢复老挝国际监察和监督委员会的活动。”
