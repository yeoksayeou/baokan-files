    Not Afraid of the Dragon King, Not Afraid of Heaven
    Competing Fiercely with the North Wind
    People say the North Wind is a bully,
    I say the North Wind is nothing;
    Labor enthusiasm is a ball of fire,
    Burning even brighter than the sky;
    Even snow seas and ice mountains,
    Will melt when they meet it;
    The determination to build water conservancy is firm,
    I'm not afraid of the biggest North Wind.
      [Chen Daoxin, Macheng, Hubei]
    Leading the Dragon King up the Mountain
    The Dragon King's nose is led by the commune members,
    Leading the Dragon King up the mountain,
    Waterwheels strung into a line,
    Forcing the river water up the mountain.
      [Xinli Commune, Shapingba District, Chongqing]
    This Year's Drought Resistance Has Several Dragons
    The sun rises a little red,
    The Communist Party's leadership is very different;
    In the past, drought resistance was done by hand,
    This year's drought resistance has several dragons.
          [Nanan District, Chongqing]
    Repairing Reservoirs is Like Repairing Granaries
    The Communist Party is like a dear mother,
    Leading the people to build new ponds,
    A load of earth, a bowl of water,
    A bowl of water, a grain of rice,
    Repairing reservoirs is like repairing granaries.

    不怕龙王不怕天
    跟北风斗狠
    人说北风风里霸，
    我说北风不算啥；
    劳动热情火一团，
    热火朝天火更大。
    就是雪海与冰山，
    碰上要它就溶化；
    兴修水利决心坚，
    天大北风我不怕。
      〔湖北麻城　陈道信〕
    牵着龙王上了山
    龙王鼻子社员牵，
    牵着龙王上了山，
    水车牵成一条线，
    硬着河水爬上山。
      〔重庆沙坪坝区新立社〕
    今年抗旱几条龙
    太阳出来一点红，
    共产党领导大不同；
    过去抗旱过手捧，
    今年抗旱几条龙。
          〔重庆南岸区〕
    修库好比修谷仓
    共产党，像亲娘，
    领导人民修新塘，
    一挑土，一碗水，
    一碗水，一颗粮，
    修库好比修谷仓。
