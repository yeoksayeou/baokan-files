    Using Machines to Weave Bamboo Products
    (Our Newspaper’s Report) The saying “A knife, a saw, two bamboo poles make a business” which described the arduous labor of bamboo craftsmen, is no longer applicable to the Luohe City Bamboo and Rattan Factory. Now, machines are used in the factory’s seven workshops and sixteen processes. Semi-mechanized production has been basically realized, changing the old production outlook.
    In 1958, the social demand for bamboo and rattan products increased greatly, and handicraft production lagged far behind objective needs. The factory's Party branch held several branch committee meetings, analyzed and studied the current situation, unified understanding, and decided to be promoters of the revolution, relying on their own efforts to arm themselves, extensively mobilizing the masses, and making a big push for technological revolution. In May, veteran technician Liu Deshun created a machine for making bamboo strips, which increased the production efficiency of bamboo strips from 180 per day to 2,000. The branch immediately seized on this event, organized employees to visit and study, and educated the masses with vivid examples. In this way, the minds of most employees were opened, and they generally realized that invention and creation were not so mysterious, and everyone could be an engineer, thus quickly setting off a climax of "comparing with Liu Deshun, learning from Liu Deshun, and catching up with Liu Deshun."
    After the masses were mobilized, they were full of enthusiasm, and everyone wanted to show their skills, but where to start, their thoughts were not completely clear. The branch promptly made a technological innovation plan, and according to the key problems in production, from sawing materials and splitting bamboo strips to weaving, put forward seventeen topics to guide everyone to focus on production, break through one point, and promote one link after another. First, organize forces to break through the sawing of materials. After the sawing of materials was broken through, the splitting of bamboo strips could not keep up, and efforts were concentrated to break through the splitting of bamboo strips. After the splitting of bamboo strips was broken through, the spearhead of technological revolution was directed at the weaving workshop. After the weaving workshop broke through the barrier of the mat weaving machine, according to the same principle, the basket weaving machine, the curtain weaving machine, the flower basket weaving machine, etc., were also successfully trial-produced. Splitting bamboo strips is a key process in the production of bamboo products, with high technical requirements, high labor intensity, and the operator has to bite one end of the bamboo strip with their mouth, and both hands and mouth have to use force. Older technicians who had lost their teeth could no longer do it. At that time, only twenty-two people in the factory could do it. If one person took leave, six or seven people in the next process would stop work and wait for materials. After the bamboo splitting machine was created, only three apprentices were needed to take care of three bamboo splitting machines, replacing the work of more than twenty technicians.

    用机器编竹器
    本报讯　“一把刀，一条锯，两根竹竿做生意”这句描述竹匠的笨重劳动的谚语，对漯河市竹藤厂来说已经不适用了。现在，这个厂七个车间、十六道工序已经使用了机器。基本上实现了半机械化生产，改变了旧的生产面貌。
    1958年，竹藤制品的社会需要量大量增加，手工业生产远远落后于客观的需要。这个厂的党支部召开几次支委会，对当前形势进行了分析和研究，统一了认识，决定要做革命的促进派，自力更生，自己武装自己，广泛发动群众，大闹技术革命。5月间，老技工刘德顺创造了制竹牌的机器，使竹牌的生产效率由日产一百八十个提高到两千个。支部马上就抓住这一事迹，组织职工参观学习，以活人活事教育群众。这样，大多数的职工思想开了窍，普遍认识到：发明创造并不那么神秘，大家都可以当工程师，因而迅速地掀起了“比刘德顺，学刘德顺、赶刘德顺”的高潮。
    群众发动起来后，干劲十足，人人都想一显身手，可是从哪里下手，思想还不完全明确。支部又及时作出了技术革新的规划，根据生产中的关键性问题，从锯料、破篾到编织，提出了十七个课题，引导大家以生产为中心，突破一点，一环推动一环。先组织力量，突破锯料这一关。锯料突破后，破篾赶不上，又集中力量突破破篾这一关。破篾突破了，技术革命的矛头又指向编织车间。编织车间突破了编席子机这一关以后，根据相同的原理，编篓子机、编帘子机、编花篮机等，也就接着试制成功。破篾是竹器生产的关键性工序，技术高，费力大，操作时要用嘴咬住竹篾的一端，手和嘴都得用劲，上了年纪的技工牙掉了就不能再干，当时全厂只有二十二人能做，如果有一人请了假，下道工序的六、七个人就会停工待料。破篾机创造出来以后，全厂只要三个学徒工看管三台破篾机就够了，代替了二十多名技术工人的工作。
