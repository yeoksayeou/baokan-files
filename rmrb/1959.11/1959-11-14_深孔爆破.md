Industrial Common Sense:

	To extract coal from underground, it is first necessary to drill blast holes in the coal seam (or rock), then load explosives into the holes and detonate them to excavate roadways. The usual method of drilling holes is to use a drill rod that is 1.8 to 2.2 meters long. This type of drill rod can only drill blast holes that are 1.5 to 2 meters deep.

	Deep hole blasting involves using long drill rods of 3.5 meters or more to drill blast holes. This allows the roadway advance per blast to be increased from 1.5 to 2 meters in the past to about 3 meters, which greatly improves the efficiency of tunneling.

    深孔爆破
    要把煤炭从地下采出来，首先要在煤层（或岩石）内打炮眼，然后在眼内装药放炮，开掘巷道。普通的打眼方法是采用一点八到二点二米长的钎子，这种钎子只能打一点五到二米深的炮眼。
    深孔爆破是使用三点五米以上的长钎子打炮眼，这样，就使每放一次炮的巷道进度由过去的一点五到二米提高到三米左右，这就大大地提高了掘进的效率。
