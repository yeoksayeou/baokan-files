The basic task of commercial work is to serve production on the one hand and consumers on the other. However, since commercial departments are distributed in various regions of the country, the specific embodiment of the production viewpoint and mass viewpoint of commercial work in different regions is different, and the service focus and service methods are also different.

The basic tasks of urban commercial departments are: to strengthen cooperation between industry and commerce, support production, closely connect urban and rural areas, wholesale and retail, give play to the role of cities in supporting rural areas, and organize the economic life of urban people.

Commercial departments should do everything possible to supply the raw materials and materials needed by industry. Actively purchase industrial products and handicrafts. Fully support the development of industrial production and handicraft production.

In economically underdeveloped areas, commercial departments should also closely contact all parties, communicate information, organize inter-factory cooperation, regional cooperation, mutually adjust materials, help find equipment, and, if necessary, can pay part of the payment in advance, and do everything possible to promote the development of local industry.

Urban commercial departments should further improve urban-rural mutual assistance, do a good job in urban support for rural areas, and promote the development of agricultural production. It is necessary to improve the distribution of goods according to the needs of different regions such as cities, rural areas, industrial and mining areas, and ethnic minority areas.

Urban retail commerce, catering, and service industries should continue to carry forward the spirit of the Tianqiao Department Store's sincere service to consumers, continuously improve service attitudes, improve service quality, continuously increase the variety of commodities, appropriately increase service items, and maintain the business characteristics and special flavors of commerce and services. In terms of commercial organization forms, it should be a combination of specialized stores, comprehensive stores, and mobile supply. It is also necessary to rely on the masses to organize resident consignment stores and service stations, organize mobile sales and mobile services, do everything possible to facilitate residents, and organize the economic life of urban people.

Agriculture is the foundation of national economic development. Rural commercial work should, under the leadership of the Party committee, vigorously supply agricultural production materials, purchase agricultural and sideline products and local specialties and waste products, promote the development of agricultural production and diversified management; help communes run industries, promote the technological transformation of agriculture, and accelerate the realization of agricultural mechanization, water conservancy, chemicalization, and electrification; and organize the economic life of rural people.

In organizing the supply of agricultural production materials, on the one hand, it is necessary to implement the policy of "taking materials locally, producing locally, and supplying locally," focusing on self-reliance and striving for external assistance, and help people's communes run the industries that communes should run to ensure the supply of agricultural production materials. On the other hand, it is necessary to do a good job in the supply of agricultural production materials uniformly allocated and planned by the state.

In promoting the diversified management of people's communes, it is necessary to help communes establish the idea of "relying on the mountains to eat the mountains, and raising the mountains by eating the mountains," participate in the formulation of production plans, vigorously open up various production avenues such as planting, raising, weaving, cutting, harvesting, picking, burning, boiling, processing, and transportation, and promptly implement the production plan to the production units, and sign production and sales contracts to closely integrate production and sales. At the same time, it is necessary to help communes rationally arrange labor, help communes raise production funds, and solve various difficulties in seeds, breeding livestock, tools, and technology, so that various sideline production can be rapidly developed.

In the purchase of agricultural and sideline products, we must adopt the method of long-term plans, short-term arrangements, grasping seasons, highlighting key points, combining concentrated purchases with regular purchases, fixed purchases with mobile purchases, and store purchases with organizing mass purchases. We must vigorously publicize the general line and carry out mass movements on a large scale. The purchase of cash crops such as cotton, hemp, and tobacco must always implement the method of grasping greatly, grasping early, and completing in one go. Small local products and waste products should be purchased all year round. Practice has proved that product line-up and grasping every season is an effective method for doing a good job in the purchase of agricultural and sideline products.

In addition, it is necessary to properly organize the economic life of rural people according to the new situation after the people's communes.

Commercial workers in industrial, mining, and forestry areas must firmly establish the viewpoint of serving production. The task of stores in industrial, mining, and forestry areas is to do a good job in the economic life of the local people. The operating principle is: where production goes, supply goes; what is needed, supply what; when is it needed, supply when. Do everything possible to make workers eat well, drink well, dress well, and rest well, so as to produce well.

Commercial work in industrial, mining, and forestry areas is an extremely important aspect, but it is still a weak link. We should strengthen leadership, carry out the movement to learn from "Tongjialiang" and catch up with "Tongjialiang," and strive to greatly improve commercial work in industrial, mining, and forestry areas in a short period of time.

In ethnic minority areas, we must vigorously promote the development of production in ethnic minority areas, help local people's communes develop industry, agriculture, animal husbandry, handicraft production, and diversified management, and gradually change the backward economic situation in ethnic minority areas. At the same time, it is necessary to do a good job in the supply of special needs commodities in accordance with national customs and characteristics.

Commercial departments in urban, rural, industrial and mining, forestry, and ethnic minority areas should improve business management and implement the policy of running enterprises diligently and thriftily. Conscientiously strengthen economic accounting, rationally use funds, and fully realize fund planning management. It is necessary to carry out direct transportation of goods on a large scale and assist people's communes in doing a good job in short-distance transportation. Warehouses should generally achieve "six without one fast." Every enterprise should mobilize the masses of employees, carry out technological innovation movements, vigorously increase production and practice economy, and ensure the completion of this year's tasks.

This year, under the leadership of the Party and the brilliant illumination of the general line of socialist construction, commercial work has shown a situation of continued leap forward. Especially after the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party issued a great battle call to the people of the whole country to oppose right-leaning, boost morale, and complete the main indicators of the second five-year plan ahead of schedule this year, a new upsurge of mass movements has emerged that sweeps away right-leaning, fiercely attacks conservatism, boosts morale, and focuses on the purchase of agricultural and sideline products. At present, this movement is developing more comprehensively and deeply, and it is entirely possible to complete and overfulfill this year's commercial plan ahead of schedule.

The current situation is very good, but there are still difficulties in our work. We must rely on the leadership of the Party, adhere to putting politics in command, thoroughly oppose right-leaning, boost morale, boldly mobilize the masses, carry out competitions (such as industry competitions, district competitions, etc.), evaluations, set up flags, establish models, vigorously promote advanced experience, vigorously publicize the advanced deeds of advanced units and advanced figures, mobilize the masses to compare with the advanced, learn from the advanced, catch up with the advanced, make the advanced even more advanced, and the backward catch up with the advanced, unite as one, help each other, promote each other, and improve together. Push the "six good" red flag movement of the commercial system to a new climax, and strive to complete and overfulfill this year's commercial tasks ahead of schedule.

(Note: "Six good" means good in promoting production, good in implementing policies, good in completing plans, good in business management, good in service quality, and good in advancing to redness and expertise.)

    掀起商业工作新的跃进高潮
    商业部部长程子华在全国群英大会
    商业系统先进经验交流会上的讲话（摘要）
    商业工作的基本任务是一方面为生产服务，一方面为消费者服务。但由于商业部门分布在全国各个地区，因此不同地区的商业工作在生产观点和群众观点的具体体现上是不同的，在服务重点和服务方法上也有所不同。
    城市商业部门的基本任务是：加强工商协作，支援生产，密切城市与乡村、批发和零售的关系，发挥城市支援农村的作用，组织好城市人民的经济生活。
    商业部门要千方百计地做好对工业所需原料、材料的供应。积极收购工业产品和手工业产品。全力支援工业生产和手工业生产的发展。
    在经济不发达的地区，商业部门还要密切联系各方，沟通情况，组织厂际协作、地区协作，相互调剂物资，帮助寻找设备，必要时可以预付一部分货款，千方百计促进地方工业的发展。
    城市商业部门要进一步搞好城乡互助，作好城市支援农村的工作，促进农业生产的发展。要根据城市、农村、工矿区、少数民族地区等不同地区的需要，改进商品分配工作。
    城市的零售商业、饮食业、服务业，都应当继续发扬天桥百货商场真诚地为消费者服务的精神，不断改善服务态度，提高服务质量，不断增加商品的花色品种，适当增加服务项目，保持商业和服务的经营特点和特殊风味。在商业组织形式上，应当是专业商店、综合商店和流动供应相结合。还要依靠群众，组织居民代销店、服务站，组织流动售货、流动服务，千方百计便利居民，组织好城市人民经济生活。
    农业是国民经济发展的基础。农村商业工作，应当在党委领导下，大力供应农业生产资料，收购农副土特产品和废品，促进农业生产和多种经营的发展；帮助公社办工业，促进农业技术改造，加速实现农业机械化、水利化、化学化、电气化；组织好农村人民经济生活。
    在组织农业生产资料的供应中，一方面要贯彻“就地取材、就地生产、就地供应”，以自力更生为主，力争外援为辅的方针，帮助人民公社办好公社应办的工业，保证农业生产资料的供应。另一方面要作好国家统一分配和计划分配的农业生产资料的供应工作。
    在促进人民公社发展多种经营中，要帮助公社树立“靠山吃山，吃山养山”的思想，参与制订生产规划，大力开辟种、养、编、砍、割、采、烧、熬、加工、运输等多种生产门路，及时地把生产规划落实到生产单位，并签订产销合同，使产销密切结合。同时要帮助公社合理安排劳动力，帮助公社筹集生产资金，解决种籽、种畜、工具和技术等方面的各项困难，使各种副业生产能够得到迅速的发展。
    在农副产品收购工作中，必须采取长计划、短安排、抓季节、突重点，突击收购与经常收购、固定收购与流动收购、商店收购与组织群众代购相结合的办法。必须大张旗鼓地宣传总路线，大搞群众运动。对棉、麻、烟等经济作物的收购，必须始终贯彻大抓、早抓，一气呵成的方法。对小土产和废品，要一年四季都收购。实践证明：品种排队，季季都抓，是做好农副产品收购工作的有效方法。
    此外，要根据人民公社化后的新情况，妥善组织农村人民经济生活。
    工矿林区的商业职工，要牢固地树立为生产服务的观点。工、矿、林区商店的任务是搞好当地人民的经济生活，经营原则是：生产到哪里，供应到哪里，需要什么，供应什么，什么时候需要，什么时候供应，千方百计使职工吃好、喝好、穿好、休息好，从而生产好。
    工、矿、林区的商业工作，是极为重要的一个方面，但目前还是薄弱环节，应当加强领导，开展学“同家梁”、赶“同家梁”运动，力争在短时间内，把工、矿、林区商业工作大大提高一步。
    在少数民族地区，要大力促进少数民族地区生产的发展，帮助当地人民公社发展工业、农业、畜牧、手工业生产和多种经营，逐步改变少数民族地区经济落后的面貌。同时，要按照民族风俗习惯和特点，作好特殊需要商品的供应工作。
    不论城市、农村、工矿林区、少数民族地区的商业部门，都要改善经营管理，贯彻勤俭办企业的方针。认真加强经济核算，合理使用资金，全面实现资金计划管理。要大搞商品直线运输，协助人民公社搞好短途运输。仓库要普遍实现“六无一快”。每个企业都要发动职工群众，开展技术革新运动，厉行增产节约，保证完成今年的任务。
    今年，商业工作在党的领导和社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，出现了继续跃进的局面。尤其是在党的八届八中全会向全国人民发出了反右倾、鼓干劲，提前在今年完成第二个五年计划主要指标的伟大战斗号召以后，出现了横扫右倾，猛攻保守，鼓足干劲，以采购农副产品为重点的群众运动新高潮。目前，这一运动正在更全面、更深入地向前发展着，提前完成和超额完成今年商业计划是完全可以实现的。
    目前的形势很好，但是我们的工作还是有困难的。必须依靠党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，反透右倾，鼓足干劲，放手发动群众、开展竞赛（如行业竞赛、划片竞赛等）、评比、树旗帜、立标兵，大张旗鼓地推广先进经验，大力宣传先进单位和先进人物的先进事迹，发动群众比先进，学先进，赶先进，使先进更先进，落后赶上先进，万众一心，团结互助，互相促进，共同提高。把商业系统的“六好”红旗运动推向新高潮，为提前完成和超额完成今年的商业任务而努力。
    （注：“六好”即促进生产好，执行政策好，完成计划好，经营管理好，服务质量好，向红专进军好。）
