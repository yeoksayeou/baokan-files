    Make One Tire Do the Work of Two
    The tires I use on my car average 280,000 kilometers, which is not much, but the comrades said that my tires are the best in the country and selected me to come to Beijing to attend the Congress of Heroes. This is the collective glory of our new China's drivers. I will definitely not be satisfied with this little achievement, and I will use tires and gasoline more economically in future work, making one tire do the work of two.

    Let Advanced Ideas and Advanced Experiences
    Make the Highways More Beautiful
    I am an ordinary road maintenance worker. In the old society, I couldn't get enough to eat or wear, and I worked with "my face to the yellow earth and my back to the sky." Today, everyone calls us "pioneers of road construction," and they sent me to Beijing to attend the Congress of Heroes for maintaining the highways well. This is such a great honor. I represent our group to guarantee to the Party: We must bring the spirit of this meeting to our actual work, and let advanced ideas and advanced experiences make the highways more beautiful. Our slogan is: "Not afraid of rain, not afraid of wind, not afraid of heat and cold, heavy rain and light rain will not stop the car."
    Winter is coming. We must ensure that we clear the snow as soon as it stops snowing, and we must also plant trees on both sides of the highway to make them green and evergreen in all seasons, turning the highway into a large traveling garden, providing good road conditions for transportation and completing more transportation tasks.
              Gai Hongyou, Dongliu Road Maintenance Team, Qixia County, Shandong
    I Will Definitely Do a Better Job
    I am a Tibetan escort from the Tibet Postal and Telecommunications Administration. From the age of seven, I was a slave to the nobles, living a life like a beast of burden. When I was at the end of my rope, I became a lama, hoping to get rid of my suffering under the protection of the Buddha, but who knew that a poor person who became a lama still could not escape the situation of a slave. After the liberation of Tibet, I was reborn. Because I always maintain vigilance in my work, adopt the method of "more comparison, more counting, more asking, and more checking," and actively eliminate errors, and actively participate in the technical innovation movement during the Great Leap Forward, repairing some old parts and saving a lot of funds for the country, and also designed a mobile frame for changing tires, which greatly reduced the labor intensity of changing tires and improved work efficiency. Attending the National Congress of Heroes this time has been very encouraging, and I feel that my work is still not good enough, and I must learn from everyone. After I go back, I will definitely do a better job and convey the heroic deeds to the comrades in our bureau, and under the leadership of the Party and with the help of the Han Chinese brothers, strive to build a prosperous and happy socialist new Tibet.
                  Qingze, Escort of Tibet Postal and Telecommunications Administration

    一定把工作做得更好
    我是西藏邮电管理局的一个藏族押运员。从七岁就给贵族当奴隶，过着牛马般的生活。在走投无路的时候，我出家当了喇嘛，想在佛爷的保佑下，摆脱自己的痛苦，哪知道穷人当了喇嘛，仍然摆脱不了奴隶的处境。西藏解放后，我才获得了新生。由于我在工作中时时刻刻提高警惕，采用“多对、多数、多问、多检查”的办法，积极消灭差错，大跃进中又积极投入技术革新运动，修复了一些旧零件，为国家节约了不少资金，还设计了一架换轮胎的活动架，大大地减轻了换轮胎的劳动强度，提高了工作效率。这次出席全国群英大会，受到很大的鼓舞，感到自己的工作还做得很不够，还要很好地向大家学习。回去以后，我一定把工作做得更好，把那些英雄事迹传达给我们局里的同志们，在党的领导下，在汉族老大哥的帮助下，努力建设繁荣幸福社会主义的新西藏。
