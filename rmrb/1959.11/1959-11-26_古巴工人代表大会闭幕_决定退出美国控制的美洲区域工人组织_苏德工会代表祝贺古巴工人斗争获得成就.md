Xinhua News Agency, Havana, November 23rd: The 10th Congress of the Cuban Workers' Confederation concluded today. The congress elected a new Executive Committee headed by David Salvador and passed several resolutions. Representatives who advocated trade union unity abstained from voting.

The list of candidates proposed during the election of the new leadership only included members of the "July 26th Movement."

One of the trade union leaders, Faustino Calcines, a member of the "July 26th Movement," explained the position of the left-wing solidarity representatives to the congress before the vote. He said that the list of candidates proposed by the meeting violated the revolutionary stance of Prime Minister Castro, who strongly condemned the Muharists. Therefore, they could not support this list of candidates.

The congress approved a series of resolutions, including: withdrawing from the American imperialist agency, the Inter-American Regional Organization of Workers; supporting the establishment of a unified Latin American labor union; supporting the anti-dictatorial struggles of the people of Dominica and Nicaragua; supporting the struggle of the people of Puerto Rico for independence; supporting the demand of the people of Panama to recover sovereignty over the Canal, and protesting the brutal suppression of Panamanian patriots by the American occupation forces; demanding the establishment of trade relations with all countries in the world; protesting the wage discrimination against Cuban workers by the American authorities at the Guantanamo Naval Base in Cuba, and deciding to convene a Latin American youth conference next year.

The congress also adopted the principle of one trade union per enterprise and one federation of trade unions per industrial sector to participate in the sole Cuban Workers' Confederation.

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, November 24th: The trade union delegations from the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic, which were invited to attend the 10th Congress of the Cuban Workers' Confederation, delivered congratulatory speeches to the congress at its final session.

Pimenov, a member of the Central Council of Trade Unions of the Soviet Union and director of the Council's International Department, said in his congratulatory speech to the Congress that he hoped that "all Cuban workers can achieve great success in consolidating the achievements of the Cuban revolution, striving for national economic progress, and increasing the welfare of the working masses." He said: "We Soviets have deep sympathy for the heroic Cuban people..." In order to advance the cause of peace, we need to strengthen the friendship between the workers of our two countries.

Pimenov finally presented a gift to the congress on behalf of the Soviet workers. He said: "May the fraternal support between Cuban workers and Soviet workers continue to strengthen!" He hoped that this gift would often tell Cuban workers: "You have good friends and brothers in this Soviet country, and their trade unions will always be your loyal friends."

Heinz Meier, the representative of the Free German Trade Union Federation, representing six million trade union members of the German Democratic Republic, said in his congratulatory speech to the Congress that Cuban and German workers are united against a common enemy—aggressive American imperialism—and are striving for peace and social progress for the people of our countries.

Meier emphasized that the victory of the heroic struggle of the Cuban people under the leadership of Fidel Castro filled us with joy, because this victory is part of the overall struggle for peace and social progress, and shows the progress of the Latin American workers' struggle.

The trade union representative of the German Democratic Republic expressed the hope that Cuban products could be transported to German ports and German machines could be transported to Cuban ports. The congress greeted his wish with warm applause.

Finally, the German trade union delegation presented the presidium of the congress with gifts from German workers and a trade union flag, at which point all the representatives stood up and saluted.

    古巴工人代表大会闭幕
    决定退出美国控制的美洲区域工人组织
    苏德工会代表祝贺古巴工人斗争获得成就
    新华社哈瓦那23日电　古巴工人联合会第十次代表大会今天结束。大会选出了以戴维·萨尔瓦多为首的新执行委员会，并通过了若干决议。主张工会团结的代表在投票时弃权。
    会议在选举新的领导机构时所提出的候选名单只包括了“7月26日运动”的成员。
    工会领导人之一、“7月26日运动”的成员福斯蒂诺·卡尔西内斯在投票前向代表大会阐述了左派团结主义代表的立场。他说，会议提出的候选人名单违背了卡斯特罗总理的革命立场，总理有力地谴责了穆哈耳分子。因此，他们不能支持这个候选人名单。
    代表大会批准了一系列决议，其中包括：退出美帝国主义的代理机构美洲区域工人组织；支持成立一个拉丁美洲劳工统一工会；支持多米尼加和尼加拉瓜人民的反独裁斗争；支持波多黎各人民争取独立的斗争；支持巴拿马人民收回运河的主权要求，并抗议美国占领军对巴拿马爱国者的粗暴镇压；要求与世界一切国家建立贸易关系；抗议美国当局在古巴的关塔那摩海军基地对古巴工人所实行的工资歧视，并决定明年召开拉丁美洲青年代表大会。
    大会还通过了一个企业一个工会和一个工业部门一个工会联合会参加唯一的古巴工人联合会的原则。
    新华社哈瓦那24日电　应邀参加古巴工人联合会第十次代表大会的苏联和德意志民主共和国工会代表团，在代表大会的最后一次会议上向大会致了祝词。
    全苏工会中央理事会理事和理事会国际部主任皮缅诺夫在向代表大会致祝词时说，他希望“所有的古巴工人都能在巩固古巴革命成果、争取国家经济进步和增加工人群众的福利方面获得巨大的成就”。他说：“我们苏联人对英勇的古巴人民怀着深厚的同情……”，为了使和平事业前进，我们需要加强我们两国工人的友谊。
    皮缅诺夫最后代表苏联工人向大会赠礼。他说：“愿古巴工人和苏联工人之间的兄弟般的支援继续加强！”他希望，这个礼品能经常告诉古巴工人：“你们在这个苏维埃国家里有好朋友和好兄弟，他们的工会也将永远是你们忠诚的朋友。”
    自由德国工会联合会代表团海因茨·迈尔代表德意志民主共和国六百万工会会员向代表大会致祝词时说，古巴和德国工人团结一致地反对共同的敌人——侵略成性的美帝国主义，并且争取我们各国人民的和平和社会进步。
    迈尔强调指出，古巴人民的英勇斗争在菲德尔·卡斯特罗的领导下所获得的胜利使我们感到欢欣鼓舞，因为这个胜利是争取和平和社会进步的总斗争的一部分，并且显示了拉丁美洲工人斗争的进展。
    德意志民主共和国的这位工会代表表示希望，古巴的产品能运到德国的港口，而德国的机器能运到古巴的港口来。代表大会对他表示的这种愿望热烈欢呼。
    最后，德国工会代表团向大会主席团赠送德国工人的礼品和工会的一面旗帜，这时全体代表起立致意。
