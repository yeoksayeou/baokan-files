Xinhua News Agency, 26th. The Chinese People's Liberation Army's work in popularizing secondary and higher education among the broad masses of officers has achieved remarkable success due to its adherence to putting politics in command and vigorously carrying out mass movements. According to incomplete statistics, this year approximately 84% of the officers in the entire army who should participate in learning have been organized to participate in on-the-job cultural studies. Among them, the majority of officers have joined the study of middle school courses and have completed one to two middle school courses in the past ten months; some officers have begun on-the-job study of university courses. A strong atmosphere of eagerness to learn and a situation of dual leap forward in both literary and military skills have emerged throughout the army.

This learning upsurge was rapidly formed throughout the army, inspired by the continued leap forward in the national construction cause and the various tasks of the army after the General Political Department issued instructions in January this year to basically popularize secondary and higher education among cadres within ten years. Based on the principle of focusing on on-the-job learning and taking a long-term perspective, the party committees of various units launched a mass campaign to run schools from top to bottom, established a tight teaching network with both unified leadership and decentralized management, actively carried out teaching activities, and, based on the principle of "specialized teachers as the backbone and part-time teachers as the main body," established a teaching force of tens of thousands of people. For ten months, whether they were troops performing training tasks, construction troops, border defense troops, organ cadres, or conscription cadres, they have been persistently studying in various forms of teaching organizations. Advanced units or individuals have spent three to four hundred hours studying in nine months; general units or individuals have also spent about two hundred hours studying. In some units, about 30% of the cadres have developed good self-study habits. They get up early and go to bed late, seizing every spare moment to study. Some have ensured that books, assignments, and pens are always with them, and they try to seize the time to study whether they are out on duty, on vacation visiting family, waiting for a car, riding in a car, traveling by boat, or staying in a hotel. With this determination to persist in self-study, the confidence of the broad masses of cadres in climbing the peaks of culture and science has been greatly strengthened. In the past, some people thought that "the task of graduating from university should be left to their sons to complete," but now they also believe that "illiterate people can become university students."

The experience of the rapid progress of the cultural education work of the PLA cadres proves that wherever the Party Committee attaches importance, personally takes charge, fully mobilizes the masses, and includes cultural education on the Party Committee's agenda, there will be a vigorous and lasting learning upsurge. The Party Committee of the Guangzhou Military Region decided to include cadre cultural education as one of the four key tasks for the year, and instructed the troops to make overall arrangements, adjust the contradictions between work and study time in a timely manner, and appropriately highlight the status of cadre cultural education, so that the middle school education work in various units throughout the region was rapidly and comprehensively spread out. The Party Committees of various units grasped the work tightly and meticulously, and fully mobilized the masses, which is of decisive significance for ensuring the long-term adherence to cultural education. This spring, the Party Committees of various units universally launched a "three special topics" discussion among the cadres on "whether to learn," "whether one can learn on the job," and "who to rely on for learning," cultivating the political foresight of cadres from the perspective of the long-term construction of our army, giving full play to revolutionary vigor, and relying on their own diligent study. This discussion gave officers in various positions ideological weapons. When a certain unit of the Shenyang Military Region began running a school last winter and this spring, some people thought that they were too busy with work, had no time, and it would be difficult to persist. However, after discussion, everyone believed that "it's not that you're afraid of having little time, but that you're afraid of not seizing it." After the masses were mobilized, if there were no teachers, the masses would recommend them themselves, subject to leadership review; if there were no teaching materials, the masses would purchase them themselves or send people to buy them from other places. In a few days, a vigorous learning upsurge was formed in this unit.

The PLA's cadre cultural education focuses on on-the-job learning and amateur self-study. Under the unified leadership of party committees at all levels and with the full mobilization of the masses, various units have found a set of methods for organizing learning that are suitable for the learning characteristics of army cadres, adapting to local conditions and circumstances. They have earnestly implemented the mass-based school-running line of unified leadership, decentralized management, and self-help mutual aid groups rooted in companies (small departments); in terms of school-running forms, they have adopted a combination of large (regiment), medium (battalion), and small (company or branch); they have adopted a variety of methods such as amateur school classes, self-study, and short-term intensive training; for cadres with high school level or above, they generally adopt methods such as self-study groups, self-study classes, or participating in correspondence courses, listening to broadcasts, and auditing courses at local universities; for mobile personnel, they adopt the method of "grasping both ends and squeezing in the middle," "keeping an eye on entrances and exits," combining centralized teaching with decentralized self-study, concentrating time to attend some classes before going out, seizing the time for self-study during the period, and checking, submitting assignments, and making up lessons after returning to the team. In this way, teaching is conducted in different ways for different objects, and the cadres' learning is comprehensively organized, truly achieving "more learning in slack times, less learning in busy times, continuous flow, and uninterrupted line."

In cultural education, the PLA troops have always attached importance to cultivating cadres' self-study habits, believing that this is the foundation for the in-depth and lasting nature of the cadre cultural education movement. Party committees at all levels not only regularly conduct ideological mobilization to help cadres fight against difficulties and inertia, but also assign tasks to the masses for discussion and formulate concrete plans. Many troops pay attention to giving full play to the leading role of the Party's grassroots organizations in cadres' self-study. Many troops often help cadres select self-study content, formulate self-study plans, introduce self-study reading materials, set up counseling stations and self-study mailboxes, help cadres solve difficult problems in a timely manner, regularly guide cadres on how to study independently and exchange self-study experiences, and regularly conduct assessments to maximize the enthusiasm of cadres for learning. Many cadres who persist in self-study say, "There is no big time for on-the-job learning, but small time is continuous." "Squeezing out time creates time, waiting for time creates no time." Many cadres sum up their self-study experience, saying that enthusiasm creates time, diligence creates methods, squeezing time in every possible way, diligently and assiduously studying, combining learning with application, can continuously accumulate knowledge and develop valuable self-study habits.

The vigorous development of the PLA's cadre cultural education has begun to have a practical effect on the work of the troops and the military-political study of the cadres.

Many cadres feel that after studying mathematics and science courses, it is very helpful to improve their military technical level and work efficiency; many cadres have improved their reading and writing skills after learning Chinese language, promoted the improvement of the troops' writing style, and produced many good articles.

### 挤时间　苦钻研　长流水　不断线  解放军军官好学不倦

    挤时间　苦钻研　长流水　不断线
    解放军军官好学不倦
    新华社26日讯　中国人民解放军在广大军官中普及中等、高等教育的工作，由于坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，取得了显著的成就。据不完全统计，今年全军各部队组织起来在职参加文化学习的干部约占应参加学习干部总数的84％。其中，大部分干部都加入了中学课程的学习，十个月来已学完了一至二门中学课程；一部分干部已开始在职攻读大学课程。全军上下出现一片浓厚的好学风气和习文练武双跃进的局面。
    这个学习高潮是在今年1月总政治部发布十年内在干部中基本上普及中、高等教育的指示以后，在全国建设事业和军队各项工作继续跃进的形势鼓舞下，迅速在全军范围内形成的。各部队党委依据以在职学习为主，从长期坚持着眼的方针，从上到下掀起群众办学的热潮，建立了既有统一领导，又有分级管理的严密的教学网，积极展开教学活动，并且本着“以专职教员为骨干，以兼职教员为主体”的原则，建立了一支数万人的教员队伍。十个月来，无论是担任训练任务的部队、施工部队、边防部队、机关干部、兵役干部，都坚持不懈地在各种形式的教学组织中学习。先进的单位或个人，在九个月期间，学习时间达到三、四百小时；一般的部队或个人也学习二百小时左右。某些单位已有30％左右的干部养成了良好的自学习惯。他们早起晚睡，争取一切空隙时间学习。有的做到了书本、作业、笔不离身，不论外出执勤、休假探家、候车、坐车、乘船、住店，都尽量抓紧时间学习。由于有了这种坚持自学的决心，广大干部攀登文化科学高峰的信心大大加强，过去有人认为“大学毕业的任务交给儿子们去完成吧”，现在也认为“大老粗能当大学生了”。
    解放军干部文化教育工作突飞猛进的经验证明，哪里党委重视，亲自挂帅，充分发动群众，把文化教育列入党委议事日程，哪里就会出现轰轰烈烈、持久不懈的学习热潮。广州地区部队党委决定把干部文化教育列为全年四项重点工作之一，并且指示部队统筹安排，及时调整工作和学习时间的矛盾，适当突出干部文化教育的地位，从而使全区各部队迅速全面地铺开中学教育工作。各部队党委抓紧抓细，充分发动群众，对于保证文化教育长期坚持，具有决定的意义。今年春天，各部队党委在干部中普遍展开了“要不要学”、“在职能不能学”、“学习依靠谁”三个专题的鸣放辩论，培养干部从我军长远建设着眼的政治远见，充分发挥革命干劲，依靠自己勤奋苦学。这一辩论，给了各种岗位上的军官以思想武器。沈阳地区部队某部在去冬今春开始办校时，有人认为工作太忙，没有时间，难以坚持。但是，经过辩论，大家认为“不怕时间少，就怕不去抓”。群众发动起来后，没有教员，群众就自己推荐，经领导审定，没有教材，群众就自购或派人去外地购买。不几天，一个轰轰烈烈的学习热潮就在这个部队里形成了。
    解放军干部文化教育以在职学习和业余自学为主，在各级党委统一领导下，充分发动群众，因而各部队都找到了一套适合部队干部学习特点的因时因地制宜的组织学习的方法。他们切实贯彻实行了统一领导，分级管理，连队（小部门）自学互助小组扎根的群众办学路线；在办学形式上，采取大（团）、中（营）、小（连或支部）并举；业余学校编班上课、自学和短期集训等多种方式并举；对高中程度以上的干部，一般采取自学小组、自修班或参加函授、收听广播、到驻地大学旁听等方式；对于外出流动人员，采取“两头抓，中间挤”，“把住出入口”的办法，集中教学与分散自学相结合，在外出前集中时间上一些课，外出期间抓紧自学，回队后检查、交作业、补课。这样，针对不同对象，采取不同方式进行教学，就把干部的学习全面地组织起来，真正作到了“闲时多学，忙时少学，长流水，不断线”。
    解放军各部队在文化教育中，一向重视培养干部的自学习惯，认为这是干部文化教育运动能够深入持久的基础。各级党委不仅经常进行思想动员，帮助干部同困难和惰性作斗争，并且把任务交给群众讨论，订出具体计划。许多部队注意充分发挥党的基层组织对干部自学的领导作用。不少部队经常帮助干部选择自学内容，订好自学计划，介绍自学读物，设立辅导站、自学信箱，及时帮助干部解决疑难问题，经常指导干部如何自学和交流自学经验，并且定期进行考核，最大限度地发挥干部学习积极性。许多坚持自学的干部说，“在职学习大时间没有，小时间不断。”“挤时间就有时间，等时间就没有时间”。许多干部总结自学经验说，干劲出时间，钻劲出办法，千方百计挤时间，勤学苦练，学用结合，就能不断地积累知识，养成宝贵的自学习惯。
    解放军干部文化教育的蓬勃发展，已经开始对部队的工作和干部的军事政治学习发生实际的作用。
    许多干部感到学习了数理课程之后，对于提高军事技术水平和工作效率很有帮助；许多干部学习语文之后，提高了阅读、写作的能力，推动了部队文风的改进，并且出现了不少好文章。（附图片）
