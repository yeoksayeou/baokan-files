(Our report from Shanghai, November 25) Shanghai's electrical machinery industrial system, while striving to complete this year's output value plan ahead of schedule, is actively taking measures to vigorously grasp the output and variety of products, requiring that all types of electrical machinery products needed by the state be completed in full quantity, on time, and according to variety plans.

In mid-November, the Shanghai Municipal Electrical Machinery Industry Bureau held a series of meetings to conduct a comprehensive review of the implementation of plans by various industries and factories over the past ten months. The review found that although Shanghai's electrical machinery industry faced heavy tasks this year, production had risen sharply after the anti-Rightist, boost-enthusiasm, and vigorously promote increased production and conservation movements in the second half of the year. The months of August, September, and October alone accounted for nearly one-third of the annual output value plan. However, according to a survey of fifty-four major products, by early November, two-thirds of the varieties had already completed or were close to completing their output plans ahead of schedule, while the completion of the remaining one-third was relatively poor. Many of these products are urgently needed for the state's current development of the power, coal, chemical, and non-ferrous metal industries.

When analyzing the reasons for these situations, the Electrical Machinery Industry Bureau believed that on the one hand, some products were more complex in specifications, had higher technical requirements, and used a wider variety of raw materials, making it difficult to allocate them completely, which affected the production progress. On the other hand, some factories did not pay close enough attention to output and variety, which was also an undeniable reason. In particular, in recent months, some factories, in preparation for the first quarter of next year, had invested more raw materials, some even exceeding the actual needs of the quarter, resulting in a significant increase in output value. However, large quantities of work-in-progress will only be assembled into products in the first or even second quarter of next year. Meanwhile, other factories faced difficulties in fully meeting their raw material needs when completing this year's product variety and output plans. Based on these situations, the Municipal Electrical Machinery Industry Bureau required all factories to further mobilize the masses and guide the enthusiasm of workers towards comprehensively completing the plan. Factories must also promote the spirit of collectivism, help each other, and ensure that the city's electrical machinery industry comprehensively completes the state plan. Subsequently, the Electrical Machinery Bureau re-arranged production for the next month or so, stipulating several principles: all electrical machinery products needed for national key construction projects must be completed on schedule; products that are not currently needed by the state should be appropriately adjusted in variety, and the original labor and raw materials should be used to produce urgently needed products; when preparing for production in the first quarter of next year, according to the production cycle of electrical machinery products, the input of materials should generally not exceed the actual output of the quarter, and output value should not be blindly pursued, and materials should be invested in complete sets as much as possible, so that finished products leave the factory in complete sets, and the accumulation of semi-finished products and work-in-progress should be minimized.

Based on these principles, Shanghai's electrical machinery factories have quickly taken action. Many products that originally had difficulties in fully completing the plan can now be completed after adjustments. The number of factories producing explosion-proof motors and other special motors for coal mines and chemical plants, which were originally only produced by the May First Electrical Machinery Factory, has now increased to more than thirty, and even some factories under the Mechanical Industry Bureau have come to help them rush to produce these products. The special electrical equipment, which was also only produced by one factory and only completed 63% of the annual plan by the end of October, has been re-arranged, and several factories, including Shanghai Electrical Machinery Factory, Pioneer Electrical Machinery Factory, and Shanghai Cable Factory, have joined the battle to produce this product, and completing the plan is no longer a major problem. The Municipal Electrical Machinery Bureau and specialized companies are actively helping factories balance labor and equipment these days, and factories are also mobilizing the masses, carrying out technological innovation, and tapping production potential, solving many problems of insufficient manpower and equipment caused by changes in variety.

(Our report) The broad masses of workers at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company are determined to exert even greater effort in the last month or so of this year, and win a complete victory in overfulfilling the five major indicators of output value, output, quality, labor productivity, and cost reduction.

Since the beginning of this year, the company has achieved very significant results in production. As of November 24, the total output value has completed 91% of the annual state plan, and the output of the main products, pig iron and steel, has completed 86% and 94% of the annual plan, respectively. Steel and cast iron pipes have completed the annual plan thirty-eight days and sixty-seven days ahead of schedule, respectively. By the end of October, the total cost of comparable products had been reduced by 5% compared with the plan, and labor productivity had increased by 7.9% compared with the plan. Currently, 362 groups and 3,480 individuals have completed their annual plans ahead of schedule.

In order to overfulfill the annual production plan more fully and comprehensively, in this last month or so, the workers are competing with each other, seizing every second, and vigorously promoting major new technologies and new experiences in iron and steel production. Since November, the workers have put forward 641 suggestions for innovative technologies and promoted 201 advanced experiences. The converter workers held a joint technical demonstration of high-carbon pulling operations, shortening the blowing time of each heat of steel by six minutes. This alone allows for the production of an additional 100 tons of steel per day. Electric furnace workers have promoted new technologies such as oxygen steelmaking and high-power rapid steelmaking, shortening the steelmaking workshop from 200 minutes to 181 minutes, and breaking the highest daily production record three times in ten days. The No. 3 blast furnace has successfully implemented a new high-pressure operation technology, greatly increasing the smelting intensity, and is expected to increase the production level by another 10%.

Around iron and steel production, the company is vigorously grasping the "front, back, left, and right," so that raw material supply, equipment maintenance, and internal transportation can keep up with the growth needs of iron and steel production. Repair and transportation workers put forward the slogan of "on-site service," taking the initiative to visit blast furnaces and converters to formulate joint cooperation methods. In more than a month, the repair workers rushed to produce more than 200 urgently needed spare parts for the blast furnace. The coking workers improved the coal loading and water regulation operations, improving the yield and quality of coke, creating conditions for increased blast furnace production.

At the same time, they also plan to implement twenty-two major measures to prepare for next year's production.

    统筹安排，加强协作，突破薄弱环节
    上海电机工业大抓产量和品种
    石钢职工决心在今年最后几十天中分秒必争全面跃进
    本报上海25日电　上海电机工业系统在争取提前完成今年产值计划的同时，积极采取措施大抓产品的产量和品种，要求做到国家所需要的各种电机产品都能按量、按期、按品种全面完成计划。
    11月中旬，上海市电机工业局接连举行会议，对各行业、各工厂今年头十个月来执行计划的情况作了一次全面的检查。检查结果发现：上海电机工业今年任务虽然很重，但经过下半年的反右倾、鼓干劲、厉行增产节约运动，各厂生产直线上升。8、9、10三个月几乎完成了全年产值计划的三分之一。但是，据五十四种主要产品的调查，到11月上旬，有三分之二的品种已经提前完成和接近完成产量计划，另外的三分之一，完成情况比较差，其中有不少产品都是国家目前发展电力、煤炭、化工、有色金属等工业迫切需要的。
    电机工业局在分析以上这些情况的原因时认为：一方面是由于某些产品规格比较复杂，技术要求较高，所用的原材料品种多、不容易配齐，影响了生产进度；另一方面少数工厂对产量、品种抓得不够紧，也是一个不可忽视的原因。特别是在最近几个月来，有些工厂在为明年第一季度作准备时，原材料投入量多了一些，有的还超过了一季度的实际需要，结果产值是大大提高，可是大批的在制品要到明年一季度甚至二季度时，才能装配成产品；而另外一些工厂在完成今年产品品种产量计划时，有些原料得不到充分满足。根据这些情况，市电机工业局要求各厂必须进一步发动群众，把职工们的生产热情引导到全面完成计划上去。工厂之间也必须发扬集体主义精神，互相帮助，保证全市电机工业全面完成国家计划。接着，电机局对今后一个多月的生产重新作了安排，规定了几项原则：凡属国家重点建设所需要的电机产品，都必须如期完成；国家目前暂时不需要的产品，在品种上适当加以调整，把原来的劳动力、原材料用来生产急需的产品；在为明年一季度生产作准备时，根据电机产品生产周期，投料一般不应超过一季度的实际产量，不要盲目追求产值，尽可能做到成套投料，让成品成套出厂，尽量减少半成品、在制品的积压。
    根据这些原则，上海各电机工厂已经迅速行动起来。许多原来全面完成计划有困难的产品经过调整，现在都能完成了。煤矿、化工厂用的防爆电机等特种电机，原来只有五一电机厂一个工厂生产，现在已经增加到三十多个工厂，连机械工业局的一部分工厂也都前来帮助他们赶制这类产品。原来也只有一个厂生产、到10月底只完成全年计划63％的电工专用设备，经过重新安排后，有上海电机厂、先锋电机厂、上海电缆厂等好几个工厂，都投入了这种产品的战斗，完成计划已经问题不大。市电机局和专业公司这几天正在积极帮助各厂平衡劳动力和设备，各厂也在发动群众，开展技术革新，挖掘生产潜力，解决了许多由于品种变换所带来的一些人力、设备的不足问题。
    本报讯　石景山钢铁公司的广大职工，决心在今年最后一个多月中鼓足更大干劲，夺得全面提前完成产值、产量、质量、劳动生产率和降低成本五大指标的满堂红。
    今年以来，这个公司在生产上取得了十分显著的成绩，到11月24日为止，总产值已经完成全年国家计划的91％，主要产品生铁和钢的产量分别完成了全年计划的86％和94％；钢材和铸铁管已经分别提前三十八天和六十七天完成了全年计划。到10月底，可比产品总成本比计划降低了5％，劳动生产率比计划提高了7.9％。目前，已有三百六十二个小组和三千四百八十一人提前完成了全年计划。
    为了更多更全面地超额完成全年生产计划，在这最后一个多月里，职工们更是你追我赶，分秒必争，大力推广钢铁生产中重大的新技术、新经验。11月以来，职工们已经提出了六百四十一项革新技术的建议，推广了二百零一项先进经验。转炉工人举行了高拉炭操作的联合技术表演，把每炉钢的吹炼时间缩短了六分钟，仅这一项，每天就可以多产钢一百吨。电炉工人推行了氧气炼钢和大功率快速炼钢等新技术，使炼钢车间由二百分钟缩短到一百八十一分钟，十天内连续三次刷新了最高日产纪录。三号高炉成功地进行了高压操作新技术，大大提高了冶炼强度，预计可以把生产水平再提高10％。
    围绕着钢铁生产，这个公司正大抓“前后左右”，使原材料供应、设备维修和厂内运输工作等方面，跟上钢铁生产增长的需要。修理、运输工人提出“服务上门”的口号，主动到高炉、转炉登门拜访，共同制订了联系协作办法。修理工人一个多月中就为高炉赶制了二百多项急需的备件。炼焦工人改善了装煤和调水操作，提高了焦炭的产量和质量，为高炉增产创造了条件。
    同时他们还计划执行二十二项重大措施，为明年生产做好准备。
