The U.S. ruling clique is using the "peace" smokescreen they release to further engage in the arms race, especially accelerating the development of missiles and expanding missile bases.

According to recent news from Washington, the Eisenhower administration, disregarding the huge fiscal deficit this year, has decided to continue to maintain the current huge direct military expenditure of 41 billion US dollars in the next fiscal year, and focus on the development of missiles. The September 28th issue of "U.S. News & World Report" revealed that the United States will greatly develop "Atlas," "Titan," "Polaris," and "Minuteman" long-range missiles in the next fiscal year; and accelerate the development of tactical missiles such as "Pershing," "Hound Dog," and "Nike-Zeus." At present, the experimental program for research and development of the "Nike-Zeus" anti-missile missile alone involves more than 60 projects.

At the same time, the Pentagon is frantically expanding its intercontinental missile squadron. In January, the "New York Times" revealed that the U.S. government decided to increase the intercontinental missile squadron from the original plan of 13 squadrons to 20 squadrons. An August issue of "Newsweek" reported that Defense Secretary McElroy had approved the establishment of nine new intercontinental missile squadrons. On October 20, "New York Times" reporter Baldwin pointed out that Washington is preparing to establish 60 "Nike-Zeus" missile battalions by 1967. If each battalion is equipped with 50 missiles as planned, and has complete electronic guidance computing devices that can simultaneously track three targets, then this cost alone will reach 9.2 billion US dollars.

The United States not only greatly expands missile bases at home, but also intensifies the establishment of missile base networks in Europe, Asia, and Africa. According to the recent Bonn "Parliamentary Political News Bulletin," the Supreme Command of the North Atlantic Group controlled by the United States is planning to form a missile base network including more than 60 missile battalions in Western Europe by the end of 1960. By 1963, one hundred missile battalions will be established in Western Europe. At present, the United States has already established approximately 30 missile units equipped with medium-range and short-range missiles in Europe. The United States has successively reached agreements with Britain, Italy, and Turkey to establish medium-range missile bases with a range of 1,500 miles in these countries. The construction of the bases is still being accelerated, and medium-range missiles with nuclear warheads are being prepared for shipment. Kyodo News Agency’s Washington correspondent reported on October 11: "The medium-range missile squadrons currently being built in Britain, Italy, and later in the new Balkan bases, have not only included Eastern Europe but also the Soviet Union completely within the range of nuclear offensive."

In the Far East, in addition to shipping "Sidewinder" missiles to Japan and establishing missile bases, the United States is expanding its largest missile base in the Far East on Okinawa, and transporting "Honest John" and "Matador" missiles to South Korea and Taiwan. On November 20, the United States also conducted secret missile exercises on Okinawa.

The United States is also stepping up negotiations with Pakistan and Iran to build missile bases. The Pakistani government is trying to deny the fact that the United States is building missile bases in West Pakistan. However, news revealed by government-controlled Pakistani newspapers confirms that the work of building bases by the United States is proceeding intensely. In Iran, according to the West German "New Rheinische Zeitung" on February 18, the United States is also establishing medium-range rocket installations, "bringing the powerful industrial centers of southern Siberia close to 'Jupiter' and 'Thor' rockets. An American missile circle will be formed around southern Soviet Union."

In addition, the United States has established atomic weapons launch sites and missile launch sites in the Sahara region of North Africa. The United States is trying its best to permanently occupy military bases in Morocco, Tunisia, and Libya in order to expand them into missile bases.

U.S. officials and newspapers make no secret of the fact that the United States is racing against time to catch up with the Soviet Union in the development of new weapons such as missiles, in order to save the complete bankruptcy of its "policy of strength." Herbert York, director of the Advanced Research Projects Agency of the U.S. Department of Defense, exclaimed on October 5 that the thrust of the first stage of the rocket that launched the Soviet Union's third Sputnik was twice that of the U.S. "Atlas missile." He said: "In this (ballistic missile) field, the comparison between our development level and that of the Russians is a matter of life and death," and "the United States may need at least one year to catch up with the level of the Soviet Union's launch of the third cosmic rocket." Brown, director of the Research Department of the U.S. Army Ballistic Missile Agency, requested five years to catch up with the Soviet Union. According to a UPI report on October 29, senior research officials at the U.S. Department of Defense advocated that the entire U.S. space program should be directly led by the President, "in order to catch up with Russia's victory in space."

    美国在欧亚非地区扩建导弹基地网
    搜刮庞大费用集中力量发展导弹生产
    本报讯　美国统治集团正在利用它们放出的“和平”烟幕，进一步进行军备竞赛，特别是加紧发展导弹，扩大导弹基地。
    据最近华盛顿消息，艾森豪威尔政府不顾今年出现的巨大财政赤字，已决定下一财政年度继续保持目前四百一十亿美元的庞大军事直接开支，并把重点放在发展导弹上面。9月28日“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志透露，美国下一财政年度将大大发展“阿特拉斯式”、“大力神式”、“北极星式”、“民兵式”远程导弹；并加紧发展“潘兴式”、“猎狗式”、“奈克—宙斯式”等战术导弹。目前仅是研究和发展“奈克—宙斯式”反导弹导弹的试验计划就达六十个以上。
    与此同时，五角大楼疯狂地扩充它的洲际导弹中队。1月份“纽约时报”透露美国政府决定把洲际导弹中队从原计划的十三个中队增加为二十个中队。8月份的一期“新闻周刊”报道，国防部长麦克耳罗伊已批准成立九个新的洲际导弹中队。10月20日“纽约时报”记者鲍德温指出，华盛顿准备在1967年成立六十个“奈克—宙斯式”导弹营，如果每营按计划配备五十枚导弹，并拥有可以同时追踪三个目标的全部电子导向计算装置，那么仅这笔费用就将达九十二亿美元。
    美国不仅在国内大事扩建导弹基地，而且加紧在欧洲和亚非等地建立导弹基地网。根据最近波恩的“议会政治新闻公报”透露，美国所控制的北大西洋集团最高司令部正在计划到1960年末在西欧组成一个包括六十多个导弹营的导弹基地网。到1963年，则在西欧建立一百个导弹营。而目前美国在欧洲已经建立了装备着中程和短程导弹的导弹部队大约三十个单位。美国已先后同英国、意大利和土耳其达成协议，在这些国家设立射程一千五百英里的中程导弹基地，建设基地的工程仍在加紧进行，并准备运出装有核弹头的中程导弹。共同社驻华盛顿记者10月11日报道：“目前在英国、意大利建设的以及后来新建设的巴尔干基地上的中程导弹中队，已经不仅把东欧而且把苏联完全包括在进行核进攻的射程之内”。
    在远东，美国除了向日本运进“响尾蛇式”导弹和设立导弹基地外，正在冲绳岛扩建它在远东的最大导弹基地，并把“诚实的约翰式”“斗牛士式”导弹装备运进南朝鲜和台湾。11月20日美国还在冲绳岛作了秘密导弹演习。
    美国还加紧同巴基斯坦和伊朗进行建造导弹基地的谈判。巴基斯坦政府力图否认美国在西巴基斯坦建立导弹基地的事实，然而，政府控制的巴基斯坦报纸透露的消息证实，美国兴建基地的工作正在紧张地进行。在伊朗，据西德“新莱茵报”2月18日报道，美国也正在建立中程火箭装置，“使西伯利亚南部强大的工业中心同‘丘辟特’和‘雷神’火箭相接近。围绕着苏联南部将形成一个美国导弹圈。”
    此外，美国已在北非的撒哈拉地区建立了原子武器发射场和导弹发射场。美国竭力企图永远霸占在摩洛哥、突尼斯、利比亚的军事基地，以便扩建成为导弹基地。
    美国官方和报纸毫不掩饰美国正在争取时间，在发展导弹等新武器上面赶上苏联，以挽救它的“实力政策”的彻底破产。美国国防部高级研究计划局局长赫伯特·约克10月5日惊呼：苏联发射第三号小月球的火箭的第一级推力，两倍于美国“阿特拉斯式导弹的推力”，他说：“在这个（弹道导弹）领域里我们同俄国人的发展水平的对比是一个生死攸关的问题”，“而美国可能至少需要用一年的功夫才能赶上苏联发射第三枚宇宙火箭的水平”。美国陆军弹道导弹局研究部主任布劳恩则要求五年赶上苏联。据合众国际社10月29日报道，美国国防部的高级研究负责人主张，整个美国空间计划最好由总统直接领导，“以便赶上俄国在空间方面取得的胜利。”
