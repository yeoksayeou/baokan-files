Developing Diversified Operations to Strive for an All-Round Bumper Harvest

Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, 10th – Although Bulgaria suffered from an unprecedented drought this year, thanks to the mass water conservancy construction movement and various high-yield measures carried out after the merger of small co-ops into large co-ops, fifteen important crops, including wheat, corn, sunflower seeds, cotton, and sugar beets, achieved bumper harvests. Yields per unit area exceeded historical highs, with average increases ranging from nearly one quintal to ninety quintals per hectare compared to last year.

This was revealed to the Xinhua News Agency reporter by Vilkov, Director of the Crop Bureau of the Bulgarian Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, recently.

Wheat, one of Bulgaria's most important crops, achieved a great harvest this year. Over 1.39 million hectares of wheat were planted nationwide, with an average yield of 17 quintals (1,700 kilograms) per hectare, an increase of nearly one quintal compared to last year.

Corn also achieved a bumper harvest this year. Corn ranks second among Bulgaria's crops. The average yield this year reached 22 quintals per hectare, an increase of nearly one quintal compared to last year.

The members of Bulgaria's vast agricultural production cooperatives launched a series of measures in this year's agricultural leap forward movement, such as building water conservancy projects, deep plowing, and applying more fertilizer, ensuring a great agricultural harvest this year. This year, the irrigated area for grains (including wheat, barley, and oats), corn, sunflower seeds, cotton, and sugar beets reached nearly 250,000 hectares, almost doubling compared to last year.

Wheat and corn fields, which were previously unfertilized or received little fertilizer, were fertilized with chemical fertilizers and farmyard manure this year. Sunflower seeds also received chemical fertilizer for the first time ever.

In addition, advanced cultivation methods such as hole planting of corn and seedling cultivation of cotton were adopted and promoted.

    发展多种经营  争取全面丰收
    兴修水利多施肥　采用先进栽培法
    保加利亚十五种农作物空前丰收
    据新华社索非亚10日电　保加利亚今年虽然遭到了数年来未曾有过的干旱，但是由于小社并大社后，开展群众性兴修水利运动及各种丰产措施的结果，小麦、玉米、葵花籽、棉花、甜菜等十五种重要农作物都获得了丰收，单位面积产量都超过了历史上最高水平，平均每公顷比去年分别提高了将近一公担到九十公担。
    这是保加利亚农林部作物局局长维尔科夫最近告诉本社记者的。
    保加利亚最主要的农作物之一的小麦今年获得了大丰收。全国共种了一百三十九万多公顷小麦，平均每公顷打了十七公担（一千七百公斤），比去年增加了将近一公担。
    今年玉米获得了丰收。玉米在保加利亚农作物中占第二位。今年每公顷平均产量达到了二十二公担，比去年增加也将近一公担。
    保加利亚广大的农业生产合作社的社员在今年农业跃进的运动中开展了兴修水利、深耕、多施肥料等一系列的措施，保证了今年的农业大丰收。今年，麦子（包括小麦、大麦、燕麦）、玉米、葵花籽、棉花和甜菜的灌溉面积差不多达到了二十五万公顷，比去年几乎增加了一倍。
    过去不施肥或很少施肥的小麦和玉米田，今年也施了化肥和厩肥。葵花籽今年也破天荒第一次得到了化肥的滋养。
    此外，还采用和推广了如穴种玉米、棉花育苗等先进的栽培法。
