Title: Revolutionary Order is the Most Normal Order

Revolution to the end means "change" to the end
Some people are afraid of "change," supposedly because they are afraid of "chaos," afraid of causing "unimaginable" "side effects." In the eyes of a feng shui master, digging a ditch will offend the Dragon King, and cutting down a tree will damage the earth's veins, leading to strange disasters. In the eyes of some of our "side effect experts," deep plowing damages a plow, a few more pounds of seeds are planted in the experimental field, a bowl is broken in the cafeteria, the commune miscalculates an account... all are "unimaginable" "sins." According to the "theories" of these "experts," how many "dangers" should a person encounter while alive? Eating may cause hiccups, walking may cause falls, airplanes may crash, closing windows may cause poisoning, opening windows may cause colds... What to do? Should we follow the example of Ye Mingchen, who succeeded Lin Zexu in defending Guangzhou during the Opium War, and adopt a "seven-no principle"! Ye Mingchen's "seven-no principle" was: "No fighting, no reconciliation, no surrender, no escape, no death, no defense, no retreat." Then, isn't the "seven-no principle" of the "side effect experts": no fullness, no hunger, no sleep, no wakefulness, no walking, no sitting, no standing! Alas, if it were really so, it would be difficult to be a person!
In truth, "change" does contain a bit of "chaos." Revolution is about destroying the old order and establishing a new order. In a period of rapid social change, how can hundreds of millions of people, on their journey to liberate themselves, walk as orderly as a parade?
Right-leaning opportunists like to use "objective laws" to scare people. What are their "objective laws"? In essence, it is nothing more than: "stand still," or more precisely: "about face - run!" Our objective law is not like this, poverty leads to change. We are Marxist proponents of continuous revolution, and our task is to "change," to transform a "poor and blank" country into a great socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture. This kind of "change" is called revolution. At this stage, we want to carry out socialist revolution, technical revolution, and cultural revolution, and we must carry the revolution through to the end, that is, we must "change" to the end.
Under the wise and correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and through the heroic struggle of the people of the whole country, the face of our country has undergone and is still undergoing profound and tremendous changes. All honest people in the world often use phrases such as "a thousand miles a day," "changing with each passing day," "overwhelming mountains and seas," "earth-shattering," "one day equals twenty years," etc., to describe and praise the speed, breadth, depth of this change, and the heroic spirit of our working people in realizing this change. A small group of right-leaning opportunists within our ranks have also been frightened by the great changes in the motherland. It's time to wake up, abandon your so-called "laws" that are truly subjective and falsely objective, and follow everyone forward!

Not "Chaos with the Masses" but "Order with the Masses"
Haven't we heard the fallacy of "chaos with the masses"! Those who hold the argument of "chaos with the masses" believe that no matter what you do, you must not adopt the method of mass movement, and adopting the method of mass movement will lead to chaos. This is the logic of right-leaning opportunists.
Is it really that adopting the method of mass movement will lead to "chaos"? If the "chaos" mentioned here refers to disrupting the old order, destroying old habits, and making all those who stick to conventions, are content with the status quo, and only know how to walk the usual path feel a little flustered, then that is true. This is a completely normal phenomenon and is in line with the objective laws of the development of things. Because mass movement is revolution, and revolution is about constantly eliminating the old and establishing the new.
We have no common language with right-leaning opportunists. What they consider "chaos," we consider "order"; what they desperately oppose is what we strive to promote. Lenin once waged an irreconcilable struggle against those who opposed the so-called "revolutionary state of chaos" and the so-called "masses' nonsense," and satirized them, saying, "It would be terrible if someone who wants to be a revolutionary forgets that revolutionary order is the most normal order in history." What the right-leaning opportunists are howling about as "chaos with the masses" is actually because they do not understand the truth of what Lenin said: "Revolutionary order is the most normal order in history."
The reason why we adopt the method of mass movement in revolution and construction is precisely in line with the most fundamental law of human social development, namely the law of dialectical materialism and historical materialism. This is also our worldview. According to this Marxist worldview, only the people are truly the creators of human history, only the people are truly the source of strength and wisdom, and only the people themselves can liberate themselves. Whoever does not recognize this cannot be a true Marxist, and cannot be considered a true proletarian revolutionary. Moreover, our mass movement is by no means a blind action without organization, discipline, or government, but is strictly placed under centralized leadership, carried out in accordance with the Party's line, principles, policies, and calls, initiated and organized by the Party, and consistently guided by the Party. May I ask, how can one talk about "chaos" in such a mass movement? On the contrary, this is by no means "chaos," but precisely the most fundamental "order" of socialist revolution and socialist construction. If it were not for this most fundamental "order," then last year's Great Leap Forward, this year's continued Leap Forward, and the constant Leap Forwards in the future would all be inconceivable. "Nothing is separate from the masses," this is a fundamental experience in our Great Leap Forward.

### 革命秩序是最正常的秩序

    革命秩序是最正常的秩序
    革命到底就是“变”到底
    有的人怕“变”，据说是因为怕“乱”，怕引起“不堪设想”的“副作用”。在风水先生看来，挖一条沟就会触犯龙王，砍一棵树就会破坏地脉，以致引起奇灾大难。在我们的一些“副作用专家”看来，深耕拉坏了一张犁，试验田里多种下了几斤种子，食堂里打破了一只碗，公社算错了一笔账，……都是“不堪设想”的“罪过”。以这些“专家”的“学说”推之，一个人活着该有多少“危险”？吃饭可能打噎，走路可能摔跤，坐飞机可能失事，关窗子可能中毒，打开窗子可能伤风……怎么办呢？是不是像鸦片战争时接替林则徐守广州的叶名琛一样，来个“七不主义”！叶名琛的“七不主义”是：“不战，不和，不降，不走，不死，不守，不退”。那末，“副作用专家”的“七不主义”，是不是：不饱，不饿，不睡，不醒，不行，不坐，不立！呜呼，果真如此，其为人也难矣哉！
    说真的，“变”就含有一点儿“乱”的意思。革命就是破坏旧秩序，建立新秩序。在急剧的社会变革中，亿万人在自己起来解放自己的征途中，怎么可能像仪仗队那样走的一点儿也不“乱”呢？
    右倾机会主义分子喜欢拿“客观规律”吓唬人。什么是他们的“客观规律”呢？质言之，无非是：“原地踏步”，或者更确切的说：“向后转——跑步！”我们的客观规律不是这样，穷则思变。我们是马克思主义的不断革命论者，我们的任务就是要“变”，把“一穷二白”的国家变为具有现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化的伟大的社会主义国家。这种“变”叫做革命。就现阶段说，我们要搞社会主义革命，要搞技术革命，还要搞文化革命，必须把革命进行到底，也就是说必须“变”到底。
    在党中央和毛主席的英明、正确领导下，经过全国人民的英勇奋斗，我们国家的面貌发生了并且还正在发生着深刻的巨大的变化。世界上一切正直的人，往往用“一日千里”、“日新月异”、“排山倒海”、“翻天覆地”、“一天等于二十年”等等词句来描绘和歌颂这种变化的速度、广度、深度以及我国劳动人民在实现这种变化中的英雄气概。我们队伍内部的一小批右倾机会主义分子也被祖国的大变化吓昏了脑袋。该清醒清醒了，抛开你们那个真主观、假客观的所谓“规律”，跟随大家一起前进罢！
    （摘自11月8日湖北日报“论‘变’”作者龚同文）
    不是“群则乱”而是“群则治”
    我们不是曾经听到过“群则乱”的谬论吗！持“群则乱”的论调的人认为，无论搞什么事情，一律不能采取群众运动的方法，采取群众运动的方法就乱了。这就是右倾机会主义者的逻辑。
    真的一采取群众运动的方法就要“乱”吗？如果说这里所说的“乱”是指的打乱了旧秩序，破坏了旧习惯，使一切墨守成规，故步自封，只会按常规走路的人感到有些慌乱，那倒是有的。这是完全正常的现象，是合乎事物发展的客观规律的。因为群众运动就是革命，而革命就是要不断除旧立新的。
    我们和右倾机会主义分子是没有共同语言的。他们认为是“乱”的，我们正认为是“治”；他们拼命反对的，正是我们竭力提倡的。列宁曾经向那些反对所谓“革命混乱状态”和所谓“群众的胡闹行为”的人，进行过不调和的斗争，并讽刺他们说，“如果想作革命者的人竟忘记了革命秩序是历史上最正常的秩序，那就糟了”。右倾机会主义者所嚎叫的什么“群则乱”，实际上正是他们不懂得列宁所说的“革命秩序是历史上最正常的秩序”这个真理。
    我们搞革命，搞建设之所以采取群众运动的方法，正是符合于人类社会发展的最根本的规律即辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义的规律的。这也是我们的世界观。按照这种马克思主义的世界观看来，只有人民群众才真正是人类历史的创造者，只有人民群众才真正是力量和智慧的源泉，只有人民群众自己才能够解放自己。谁不承认这一点，谁就不能作真正的马克思主义者，谁就不能算是真正的无产阶级革命家。况且，我们的群众运动，绝不是无组织、无纪律、无政府状态的盲动，而是严格地置于集中领导之下，遵循着党的路线、方针、政策和号召开展起来的，是由党来发动、组织起来，并且由党始终不渝地进行指导的。试问，对这样的群众运动，“乱”字从何谈起呢？恰恰相反，这绝不是什么“乱”，而正是社会主义革命和社会主义建设的最根本的“治”，若不是这样最根本的“治”，那么去年的大跃进，今年的继续跃进，以至今后的不断的跃进，都将是不可思议的。“万事不离群”，这正是我们大跃进中的一项带根本性的经验。
