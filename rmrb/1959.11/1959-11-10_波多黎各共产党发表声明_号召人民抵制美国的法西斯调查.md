Xinhua News Agency, San Juan, 5th. The "Puerto Rican Monthly" published in its October issue a statement by the Puerto Rican Communist Party, which calls on the Puerto Rican people to resist the "investigation" to be carried out in Puerto Rico by the US Congressional Un-American Activities Committee.

The statement points out that this committee is scheduled to begin so-called "hearings" in San Juan on November 18 to interrogate some Puerto Ricans, while several Puerto Rican residents in New York have also been asked to attend the same meeting starting there on November 16. The statement denounces these meetings as "part of the most intense anti-democratic and most ambitious fascist conspiracy by North American corporations against the Puerto Rican people."

The statement says that no Puerto Rican invited this committee to visit Puerto Rico, and it has no moral right to conduct investigations in Puerto Rico. The statement points out that this proves that the much-publicized status of the so-called Free Associated State of Puerto Rico is in reality still nothing more than a colony of US imperialism.

The statement points out that imperialism and its mouthpieces always describe any mass movement or anyone who supports the people's wishes as a communist movement and communists. But many people on the US Congressional Un-American Activities Committee's blacklist are not communists at all, including members of the Puerto Rican government, trade union workers, and participants in the independence movement. The statement says that the real purpose of this investigation is to: stop the workers' movement, frustrate the Independence Party, encourage the Statehood Party, hinder the development of the patriotic solidarity movement for Puerto Rican independence, and slow down the revolutionary movement inspired by Cuba.

    波多黎各共产党发表声明
    号召人民抵制美国的法西斯调查
    新华社5日讯　圣胡安消息：“波多黎各月刊”十月号刊载了波多黎各共产党的声明，这篇声明号召波多黎各人民抵制美国国会非美活动委员会准备在波多黎各进行的“调查”活动。
    声明指出：这个委员会预定11月18日在圣胡安开始举行所谓“听取意见会”来对一些波多黎各人士进行侦讯，同时纽约的若干波多黎各居民也被要求出席11月16日开始在那里举行的同样会议。声明斥责这些会议“是最激烈地反对民主并且最具有野心的北美公司对波多黎各人民进行的法西斯阴谋的一部分”。
    声明说，任何波多黎各人都没有邀请这个委员会来波多黎各访问，它没有道义上的权力在波多黎各进行调查。声明指出，这件事证明：被大肆宣扬的所谓波多黎各自由联合邦的地位，实际上仍然不过是一个美帝国主义殖民地的地位。
    声明指出，帝国主义及其喉舌总是把任何群众运动或支持人民愿望的任何人说成是共产主义运动和共产党人。但是列在美国国会非美活动委员会黑名单上的很多人根本不是共产党人，其中有波多黎各政府的成员、工会工作者、独立运动的参加者。声明说：这次调查的真正目的是：制止工人运动，挫折独立党，鼓励立州党，阻挡为争取波多黎各独立的爱国团结运动的发展，并且使受到古巴鼓舞的革命运动迟缓下来。
