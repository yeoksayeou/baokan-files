Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, November 4th: The Vietnamese Labor Party's call to vigorously launch the "Patriotic Emulation Movement" has greatly inspired people from all walks of life in North Vietnam. In recent days, the broad masses of workers, farmers, youth, and women have made solemn pledges to the Party, determined to further exert revolutionary vigor, strive to overfulfill this year's national plan, and offer outstanding achievements to the Party's 30th anniversary.

On November 1st, 30,000 young people in Hanoi held a gathering in Bach Thao Park. The youth present unanimously passed a letter of determination to the Central Committee of the Labor Party and President Ho Chi Minh, responding resoundingly to the Party's call: Strive to work hard, stay ahead of time, and overfulfill the fourth quarter production plan.

President Ho Chi Minh wrote a letter to the meeting. The letter said: "Congratulations to you, may you be healthy, happy, closely united, and constantly compete, strive for excellence in all aspects of socialist construction, and dedicate the strength and spirit of your youth."

At the gathering, youth from various enterprises, construction sites, and handicraft cooperatives held more than a dozen achievement exhibitions, showcasing the achievements and inventions made in the past nine months. They also talked to each other, exchanged production experiences, and challenged each other in competitions. This gathering was also a mobilization meeting for the youth, who will turn their determination to the Party into practical actions to complete the production plan.

Workers at the Nam Dinh Textile Factory, the center of Vietnam's textile industry, to celebrate the Party's birthday, produced 54,000 meters of cloth more than planned in just three days from October 26th to 28th. The young workers of this factory put forward the heroic slogan: "Dedicate everything to the Party, no loafing, no letting the machines stop running." They also formed "shock brigades" to solve the difficulties of labor shortages in the workshops. In the textile workshop, a "three quick" movement of "patrolling quickly, seeing quickly, and connecting quickly" is currently taking shape. The yarn loading time alone has been shortened from one hour and thirty minutes to one hour.

In the upsurge of the patriotic emulation movement, the Hai Phong Cement Plant's employees overfulfilled the October cement production plan by more than 4,000 tons. This is the third time this year that the plant has achieved high overproduction.

On November 2nd, the factory held a staff meeting, deciding to further carry out labor emulation, strive to overfulfill the 1959 national plan, and dedicate the fruits of labor to the Party. The meeting also issued challenges to the Cam Pha and Hong Gai coal mines and the Nam Dinh Textile Factory.

The broad masses of farmers and rural work cadres also responded enthusiastically to the Party's call with practical actions. Two hundred and fifty-seven rural work cadres and representatives from various regions, who were participating in the All-Northern Agricultural Cooperative Management Work Experience Summary Conference in Ha Dong Province, unanimously passed a letter of determination to the Central Committee of the Labor Party on October 31st, expressing their determination to actively consolidate and develop agricultural cooperatives and mutual aid teams, work hard to fight drought, ensure a good late rice harvest, complete the autumn harvest and distribution work well, and prepare well for the victory of winter-autumn production.

Ha Dong, Ninh Binh and other provinces have recently decided to launch competitions to strive for a good autumn harvest, winter-autumn production, and cooperation.

    超额完成第四季度计划向党的生日献礼
    越南人民立志走在时间前面
    新华社河内4日电　越南劳动党关于大力开展“爱国竞赛运动”的号召，大大激励了越南北方的各界人民。这几天来，广大工人、农民、青年、妇女向党提出了庄严的保证，决心进一步发挥革命干劲，争取超额完成今年的国家计划，用优异的成绩向党的三十周年献礼。
    11月1日，河内市三万青年在百草公园举行联欢大会。到会青年一致通过给劳动党中央和胡志明主席的决心书，他们对党的号召作了响亮的回答：努力奋斗，走在时间前面，超额完成第四季度生产计划。
    胡志明主席给大会写了一封信。信中说：“祝贺你们，健康，愉快，紧密团结，不断竞赛，在建设社会主义各项工作中力争上游，献出青春的力量和精神。”
    在联欢大会上，各企业、工地、手工业合作社青年举办了十多个成绩展览会，展出了九个月来取得的成绩和创造发明。他们还互相谈心、交流生产经验、互相提出竞赛和挑战。这次联欢大会也就是青年们的誓师大会，他们将把向党表示的决心变为努力完成生产计划的实际行动。
    越南纺织工业中心——南定纺织厂的工人为了向党献礼，仅从10月26日到28日的三天里，比原计划多生产了五万四千米的布。这个厂的青年工人提出了豪迈的口号：“把一切献给党，不窝工，不让机器停止运行”。他们还成立了“突击队”，解决车间缺乏劳动力的困难。在纺织车间，目前正形成一个“巡得快、看得快、接头快”的“三快”运动。仅上纱时间就从一时三十分缩短为一小时。
    海防水泥厂的职工在爱国竞赛运动的热潮中超额四千多吨完成了10月份的水泥生产计划。这是这个厂今年以来第三次的高额超产。
    11月2日，这个厂举行了职工大会，决定进一步开展劳动竞赛，力争超额完成1959年国家计划，以劳动的硕果向党献礼。大会还向锦普、鸿基煤矿和南定纺织厂提出了挑战。
    广大农民和农村工作干部也用实际行动热烈响应党的号召。正在河东省参加全北方农业合作社管理工作经验总结会议的各地农村工作干部和代表二百五十七人，10月31日一致通过了一项给劳动党中央的决心书，表示决心积极巩固和发展农业合作社和变工组，努力抗旱，确保晚稻丰收，良好地完成秋收和分配工作，为争取冬秋生产的胜利作好准备。
    河东、宁平等省最近也决定发动竞赛，为搞好秋收、冬秋生产和合作化而奋斗。
