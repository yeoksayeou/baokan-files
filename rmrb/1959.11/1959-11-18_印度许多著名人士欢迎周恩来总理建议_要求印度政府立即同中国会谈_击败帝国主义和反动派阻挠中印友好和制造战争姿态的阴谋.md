According to the "Free Press," at a public meeting in Calcutta celebrating the forty-second anniversary of the Soviet October Revolution, the prominent figure Vivekananda Mukherjee said, "On behalf of the citizens of Calcutta, I welcome Zhou Enlai's proposal and congratulate the Chinese Premier on this attempt. We hope that Mr. Nehru can defeat the conspiracy of the reactionaries and take the path of mutual discussion."
