Workers' Suggestions

    Support the Countryside with Unused Ball Bearings
    I am a mechanical worker and often "deal with" ball bearings on machine tools. Some of the machine tools in our factory have high speeds and strict requirements for balls, so ball bearings with noise or cracks in the casing must be replaced. After being replaced, they are often thrown into the waste product department to "sleep". At the same time, I have also heard that some factories break substandard bearings to obtain steel balls. This is a serious waste. I think that in some rural areas our country uses primitive equipment and heavy transport, and these ball bearings will be of great use to them. Therefore, I suggest that relevant departments organize factories in cities to take out the ball bearings that do not quite meet their own needs to support the countryside.

### 把不用的滚珠轴承支援农村

    把不用的滚珠轴承支援农村
    我是一个机械工人，经常和机床上的滚珠轴承“打交道”。我厂有些机床因为转速高，对滚珠的要求也严格，因此凡是有杂声、或是外壳有条缝的滚珠轴承，都要换掉。换下来后，往往就扔在废品科里“睡觉”。同时，我还听说有的工厂因为需用钢珠，不惜把一些不合规格的轴承敲碎。这是一种严重的浪费。我想，目前我们的农村有些地方用的是土设备和笨重的运输工具，这些滚珠轴承，对他们都有很大的用处。因此建议有关部门组织城市各个工厂将不太合乎自己需要的滚珠轴承拿出来，支援农村。
