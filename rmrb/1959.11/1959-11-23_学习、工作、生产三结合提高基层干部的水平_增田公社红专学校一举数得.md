Combining Learning, Work, and Production to Improve the Level of Grassroots Cadres
Zengtian Commune's Red and Expert School Achieves Multiple Goals
(Our newspaper's report from Nanchang on the 22nd) The Zengtian Commune in Le'an County, Jiangxi Province, has established a Red and Expert School, effectively solving the problem of combining learning, work, and production for grassroots cadres. In its first year, the Red and Expert School has held two sessions, training eighty-five cadres and activists from all levels of the commune, which has greatly promoted the successful management of the People's Commune. The Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently summarized the educational experience of this Red and Expert School and is promoting it to all communes throughout the province.

After the establishment of the Zengtian Commune in October of last year, cadres urgently requested to improve their political, cultural, and production technology levels to meet the needs of successfully managing the commune and developing production; waiting for county-run training classes was not only too time-consuming, but they also could not leave their busy work. Under these circumstances, the Commune Party Committee, based on the specific conditions of the People's Commune, decided to establish its own Red and Expert School to train cadres. The commune, based on the principles of running schools diligently and thriftily and using local materials, organized students and some commune members to build a simple house and manufacture teaching aids, solving the problem of school buildings and equipment. The First Secretary of the Commune Party Committee served as the school's principal, and the secretaries and deputy secretaries served as teachers, and leading cadres of the County Party Committee were invited to give lectures at the school regularly. The commune also designated one hundred and fifty mu of land as the Red and Expert School's experimental garden, and part of the income was used as school operating expenses.

The learning content of the Red and Expert School includes politics, culture, and technology, and the teaching time follows the principle of "less learning during busy farming seasons, more learning during slack farming seasons; less learning on sunny days, more learning on rainy days; less learning during the day, more learning in the early morning and evening," with half the time spent on studying politics, 40% on studying culture, and the rest on learning agricultural technical knowledge.

In the political courses, the students successively studied the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction, "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," "On Practice," "On Contradiction," the Communiqué and Resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, and other documents. Through study, the political consciousness of the students has been further improved, they have distinguished between right and wrong on major issues, and they have become more determined in their proletarian stand and their determination to build socialism. For example, Chen Lingyuan, a cadre of the Wentian Team of the Wentian Brigade, was not very active in work and production labor before studying at the Red and Expert School; after studying at the Red and Expert School, he took the lead in working hard in everything, both in work and production; he said: "The Great Leap Forward, the People's Communes, and the cause of socialism, if I, a person of poor peasant origin, don't actively work, who will? I must actively do my job well!" Now, Chen Lingyuan has become an excellent production team leader. This year, the production team he leads has been running ahead of all the production teams in the commune. Another example is Zou Shisheng, the Party Branch Secretary of the Dasha Brigade, who used to not work hard, his working methods were simple, and his attitude was rigid. Since studying at the Red and Expert School, he has improved his thinking, works actively and proactively, often participates in production in various teams, mingles with commune members, and consults with the masses on matters. He has become a model cadre in the entire commune.

Among the eighty-five students in the two sessions, illiterates and semi-illiterates accounted for fifty-three before enrollment. After studying, there were no more illiterates, fifty reached the cultural level of elementary school, and thirty-four reached the level of higher elementary school or junior high school. Student Zou Shisheng was illiterate in the past, but now he can roughly read documents, write materials, and take notes.

The students successively learned agricultural knowledge such as deep plowing, soil science, varietal science, making local chemical fertilizers, new-style seedling cultivation, eliminating pests and diseases, and using agricultural machinery and planting cotton. After studying, those who didn't know what the three elements of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizers were now understood; those who couldn't plant cotton before, some have now become cotton planting experts.

On the one hundred and fifty mu of land designated by the commune for the Red and Expert School, thirty-nine mu of low-yielding land have been transformed this year, and the ninety-two mu of rice fields sown have achieved an average yield of more than one thousand two hundred jin per mu, which is 50% higher than the output of various brigades. While engaging in agricultural production, they also raised more than four hundred ducks, seven pigs, and planted ten mu of vegetables. The total income from agricultural and sideline production for the entire year, after deducting the students' food and school operating expenses and public accumulation, allows each student to receive an average of one hundred and forty yuan, exceeding the average income of ordinary commune members in the area. In this way, the Red and Expert School has not only completely achieved self-sufficiency, but also solved the problem of the family's living expenses during the students' study period.

The Red and Expert School, as the commune's research and experimental garden, has created many advanced production experiences, promoting and driving the commune's production. The commune's advanced production measures are first researched and tested at the Red and Expert School, and then promoted in the brigades. This year, the Red and Expert School created and promoted new-style agricultural tools and advanced technologies such as smoked grass and soil fertilizer, strip close planting method for rice, cotton planters, nutrient pot pressing machines, new-style paddy field leveling machines, bean planting punchers, rope making machines, and wooden harrows. After the promotion of various advanced agricultural tools throughout the commune, labor efficiency has increased four or five times. In the past, cotton was rarely grown here. This year, the Red and Expert School cultivated twenty cotton kings, one of which produced more than three hundred cotton bolls, creating experience for the commune's future development of cotton production. Because the material conditions of the Red and Expert School are not much different from those of various brigades in the commune, the production experience created is the most persuasive and easily accepted by the broad masses of commune members. The masses said: "The experience of the Red and Expert School is top-notch, we can see it, learn it, and do it."

The Red and Expert School has played the role of work team, propaganda team, and production shock brigade in various political and production movements in the commune. During the commune rectification, the students went deep into the masses to publicize the principles of commune rectification and help the commune carry out rectification. During busy farming seasons, wherever there are difficulties or where there is backwardness, the Red and Expert School sends students to support and help.

The facts of the Zengtian People's Commune Red and Expert School over the past year have proven that it is a good form of training for the vast number of grassroots cadres, and it plays an important role in further consolidating the People's Communes.

### 学习、工作、生产三结合提高基层干部的水平  增田公社红专学校一举数得

    学习、工作、生产三结合提高基层干部的水平
    增田公社红专学校一举数得
    本报南昌22日电　江西乐安县增田公社举办一所红专学校，妥善地解决了基层干部学习、工作和生产相结合的问题。红专学校成立一年中办了两期，训练了公社各级干部和积极分子八十五人，对办好人民公社起了重要促进作用。中共江西省委最近总结了这所红专学校的办学经验，向全省各公社介绍推广。
    增田公社在去年10月成立后，干部迫切要求提高政治、文化和生产技术水平，以适应办好公社、发展生产的需要；而等待县办训练班学习不仅时间来不及，他们也离不开紧张的工作。在这种情况下，公社党委根据人民公社的具体情况，决定自己开办红专学校训练干部。公社根据勤俭办学、就地取材建校的原则，组织学员和部分社员盖起一栋简单的房屋，制造教具，解决了校舍设备问题。公社党委第一书记担任学校校长，书记和副书记任教员，并聘请县委领导干部定期来校讲课。公社还划定一百五十亩田地，作为红专学校的试验园地，收入的一部分则用作学校办学经费。
    红专学校的学习内容，包括政治、文化和技术，教学时间则以“农忙少学、农闲多学，晴天少学、雨天多学，白天少学，早晚多学”为原则，以一半的时间学政治，40％的时间学文化，其余学习农业技术知识。
    学员在政治课程中先后学习了党的社会主义建设总路线、“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”、“实践论”、“矛盾论”、党的八届八中全会公报和决议等文件。通过学习，进一步提高了学员的政治觉悟，分清了大是大非，更加坚定了无产阶级立场和建设社会主义的决心。如温田大队温田小队干部陈岭元，未到红专学校学习以前，工作生产劳动都不很积极；经过在红专学校学习以后，工作、生产样样带头苦干；他说：“大跃进、人民公社、社会主义事业，我贫雇农出身的人不积极干，谁干？我一定要积极做好工作！”现在，陈岭元已成为一个优秀的生产小队长。今年他所领导的生产队一直跑在全社各生产队的前面。又如大沙大队党支部书记邹时生，过去工作不艰苦，工作方法简单，态度生硬，自从在红专学校学习后，提高了思想，工作积极主动，经常到各个小队参加生产，和社员打成一片，有事就和群众商量，已经成为了全社的模范干部。
    两期的八十五名学员中，入学前文盲和半文盲占五十三名，经过学习后，文盲没有了，达到了初小文化程度的有五十名，有三十四名达到了高小程度或初中程度。学员邹时生过去不识字，现在已能粗读文件，写材料、作记录。
    学员先后学习了深翻土地、土壤学、品种学、制造土化肥、新式育秧、消灭病虫害和使用农业机械、种植棉花等农业知识。经过学习，原来不懂得什么叫氮、磷、钾肥三要素的，现在懂得了；原来不会种植棉花的，有的人现在成了植棉能手。
    红专学校学员在公社划出的一百五十亩田地上，今年已改造了低产田三十九亩，播种的九十二亩稻田，平均亩产达到一千二百多斤，比各大队的产量高50％。在农业生产的同时，还养了四百多只鸭，七头猪，种了十亩蔬菜，今年全年农副业生产的总收入除扣除学员伙食和办校经费、公共积累以外，平均每个学员可分得一百四十元，超过当地一般社员的平均收入。这样，不仅使红专学校完全做到了自给自足，也解决了学员来校学习期间的家庭生活负担。
    红专学校做为公社的研究试验园地，创造了许多先进生产经验，促进与推动了公社的生产。公社的先进生产措施，都先在红专学校研究试验，然后再在大队推广。今年红专学校创造和推广了烟熏草土肥、水稻条形密植法、棉花播种机、营养钵压钵器、新式秧田平整器、种豆打眼器、打绳机、木制耙等新式农具和先进技术。各种先进农具在全社推广后，使劳动效率提高了四、五倍。这里过去很少种棉花，红专学校今年培植了二十株棉花大王，其中一株结了三百多个棉桃，为全社今后发展棉花生产创造了经验。由于红专学校的物质条件和公社各个大队相差不远，所以在生产上创造的经验最富有说服力，容易为广大社员所接受。群众说：“红专学校的经验顶呱呱，我们看得到、学得到、做得到。”
    红专学校在公社各个政治运动和生产运动中，发挥了工作队、宣传队和生产突击队的作用。在公社整社时，学员深入群众中宣传整社方针，帮助公社开展整社。在农忙时期，哪里有困难，哪里落后，红专学校就派学员到哪里支援和帮助。
    增田人民公社红专学校一年来的事实证明，它是训练广大基层干部的一种好形式，它对进一步巩固人民公社起着重要的作用。
