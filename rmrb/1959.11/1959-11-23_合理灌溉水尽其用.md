Use Irrigation Water Rationally and Make the Most of It
Commentator of this newspaper

The winter irrigation season has arrived, and a large amount of wheat fields urgently need irrigation. How to rationally irrigate the already built water conservancy projects, save water, and try every means to improve the utilization rate of water is an important aspect of cherishing the fruits of the masses' labor, expanding irrigation benefits, and ensuring a bumper wheat harvest next year.

After the two water conservancy upsurges in 1957 and 1958, the national irrigated area of farmland has increased to more than one billion mu, accounting for more than 60% of all cultivated land, and many advanced irrigation areas have emerged. Today, this newspaper publishes the brilliant record created by the Limin Canal in Yicheng County, Shanxi Province, and the Yudaohe Irrigation Area in Fenyang County, which is that one flow rate irrigates 100,000 mu of land, which is about twice as high as the irrigation rate of ordinary canal systems. If the irrigation systems across the country can pay attention to rational irrigation, innovate irrigation technology, and improve irrigation efficiency, then it may greatly increase the area of water use, which is certainly a remarkable thing.

At present, the utilization rate of water conservancy projects in some places is not high, and the waste of water is very serious. Farmers in some areas with better water conservancy conditions have always been accustomed to flooding irrigation, exceeding the actual water demand of crops. After excessive watering, it is easy to cause soil hardening, raise the groundwater level, and increase the alkali content of the soil, which instead brings obstacles to increasing production. Some channels are not sufficiently repaired and processed, and the phenomenon of water seepage is very serious. According to the inspection materials of many channels, the effective utilization coefficient of canal systems in various places generally only reaches 40%-50%. This is such a pity! If the water can be retained, managed, and used well, the annual outflow of water with one flow rate is 31.56 million cubic meters. If the utilization rate of water is increased to 90%, and the effective utilization rate of the canal system is increased to 80%, then more than 22.7 million cubic meters of water will be used in the fields in one year. Calculated on the basis of watering general crops four times, with each mu using 35 cubic meters of water, then one flow rate of water can irrigate more than 160,000 mu of land per year. From this, it can be seen that even the already very advanced irrigation areas still have great potential to be tapped; as for the irrigation management work in most areas of the country, there is even more potential to be tapped.

Vigorously developing water storage projects and never letting water flow away in vain is the first experience of the Limin Canal and the Yudaohe Irrigation Area. The irrigation of crops is highly seasonal. Often, when the season for watering arrives, the water volume is felt to be insufficient; when there is no need for water, most of the water flows away in vain. Therefore, taking all measures to intercept water everywhere and store water at every stage, and storing water in seasons when water is not needed, can greatly improve the utilization rate of water and fully meet the needs of crops. The Limin Canal uses this method to store a large amount of clear water. Therefore, even though it encountered a major drought of more than 70 consecutive days this summer, it was still able to fully meet the needs of cotton fields and autumn crops.

Repairing and improving channel projects to prevent water seepage and loss; repairing field projects to change flood irrigation to furrow irrigation, changing large furrow irrigation to small furrow irrigation, and vigorously developing garden-style projects can greatly save water and improve the effective utilization coefficient of canal systems. The original channel utilization coefficient of the Limin Canal could not reach 50%. After a series of measures were taken to renovate the channel, all channels were standardized, and the effective utilization coefficient of the canal system increased sharply to 70%, greatly increasing the amount of water used.

Implementing planned water use, establishing a scientific water use system, improving management organizations, fixing full-time personnel to contract irrigation all year round, and improving irrigation technology are all powerful guarantees for the Limin Canal and the Yudaohe Irrigation Area to improve the utilization rate of water from the perspective of system and organization.

The Limin Canal and the Yudaohe Irrigation Area do not have any particularly favorable conditions. They mobilized the masses, reversed conservative thinking, stored water whenever they saw it, used water whenever they had it, supplied water quantitatively, and assigned special personnel to contract irrigation. This broke the old irrigation quota and ushered in a new irrigation record.

Water is the lifeline of crops. Farmers have a common saying: "One drop of water, one grain of grain." Let us cherish water as much as we cherish grain. As long as we pay attention to learning from advanced experience and improve irrigation technology, we can greatly improve the utilization rate of water on the basis of existing water conservancy construction!

    合理灌溉水尽其用
    本报评论员
    冬灌季节已经来临，大量麦田急待灌溉。已修好的水利工程，如何合理灌溉，节约用水，千方百计提高水的利用率，这是珍惜群众劳动成果、扩大灌溉效益、保证明年小麦大丰收的重要方面。
    经过1957年和1958年的两次水利高潮，全国农田灌溉面积已增加到十亿多亩，占全部耕地的60％以上，而且出现了许多先进的灌区。今天本报发表的山西省翼城县利民渠和汾阳县峪道河灌区创造了一个流量浇地十万亩的光辉纪录，比普通渠系的灌溉率约高出一倍左右。如果全国的灌溉系统，都能注意合理灌溉，革新灌溉技术，提高灌溉效率，那就可能大大增加了用水的面积，这当然是件了不起的大事。
    现在有些地方对水利工程的利用率还不高，使用水的浪费很大。有些水利条件较好地区的农民，历来习惯于大水漫灌，超过农作物的实际需水量。过多浇水以后，容易造成土地板结，提高地下水位，增加土壤含碱量，反而给增产带来障碍。有些渠道整修加工不够，渗漏水的现象十分严重。据不少渠道的检查材料表明，各地渠系的有效利用系数一般只达到40％—50％。这是多么可惜！如果把水都能留起来、管理好、使用好的话，一个流量的水全年流出水量为三千一百五十六万公方，水的利用率如果提高到90％，渠系的有效利用率提高到80％的话，一年就会有二千二百七十多万公方的水量用在田地里。按一般作物浇四次水，每次每亩用水三十五公方计算，则一个流量的水每年可以灌溉十六万多亩土地。由此可知，即使是现在已经很先进的灌区，还大有潜力可挖；至于全国大多数地区的灌溉管理工作，可挖掘的潜力就更加多了。
    大搞蓄水工程，决不让水白流，这是利民渠和峪道河灌区的头一条经验。作物的灌溉有强烈的季节性，往往到了需要浇水的季节，水量感到不足；到了不需要用水的时候，大部分水又白白流去。因而采取一切办法，处处拦水，节节蓄水，在不用水的季节把水蓄起来，就可以大大提高水的利用率，充分满足作物的需要。利民渠就是采取这个办法，蓄积了大量清水。因而今年夏季虽然遇到一连七十多天的大旱灾，还能充分满足棉田和大秋作物的需要。
    整修和健全渠道工程，防止水的渗漏流失；整修田间工程，变大水漫灌为畦灌，变大畦灌为小畦灌，大搞园田化工程，这些都能大大节约用水，提高渠系的有效利用系数。利民渠原有的渠道利用系数还不能达到50％，由于采取了一系列措施改建渠道以后，使所有的渠道达到规格化和标准化，渠系的有效利用系数猛增到70％，用水量大大增加了。
    实行计划用水，建立科学的用水制度，健全管理组织，固定专人常年包浇，提高灌溉技术，这些都是利民渠和峪道河灌区从制度和组织方面提高水的利用率的有力保证。
    利民渠和峪道河灌区并没有什么特别有利的条件，他们就是发动了群众，反掉了保守思想，见水就蓄，有水就用，定量供水，专人包浇，这就打破了旧的灌溉定额，出现了新的灌溉纪录。
    水是庄稼的生命线。农民有句俗话叫：“一滴水，一粒粮”。让我们像爱护粮食那样来爱护水吧，只要我们注意学习先进经验，改进灌溉技术，就能在现有水利建设的基础上，大大提高水的利用率！
