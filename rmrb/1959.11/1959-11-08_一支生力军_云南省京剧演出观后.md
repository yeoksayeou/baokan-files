    A New Force
    -- After Seeing the Yunnan Province Peking Opera Performance
    Ma Shaobo

    Our Peking Opera art has had a national influence since very early on. Since liberation, under the guidance of the Party's policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, weed through the old to bring forth the new," it has not only become popular throughout the country, but also the Peking Opera troupes in various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions have achieved vigorous development in art. The Yunnan Province Peking Opera Troupe, although located far on the frontier of the motherland, has a quite strong lineup and a very high artistic level. Without a doubt, this team is one of the elite forces in China's Peking Opera circle.

    Among the actors in the Yunnan Province Peking Opera Troupe who came to Beijing this time, some comrades were already dedicated to artistic reform and serving politics with Peking Opera as a weapon during the War of Resistance Against Japan. For example, Comrade Xu Minchu, as early as 1939, worked in the Ping Opera Propaganda Team led by Comrade Tian Han, and he was the first actor to play Ruan Fucheng in "Fisherman's Song of the Jianghan"; another example is Comrade Jin Suqiu, who began cooperating with Comrade Tian Han in 1943, and she played Bai Suzhen in the first performance of Tian Han's "Legend of the White Snake." People will not forget the achievements of these comrades. Also coming to Beijing with them this time is the senior artist Comrade Liu Kuiguan. Liu Kuiguan's martial role of Jing stands out, and his "Tongtian Rhinoceros" in particular, can be regarded as an unparalleled masterpiece of the time. In addition, there are many excellent young actors, such as Guan Su Shuang, Liu Meijuan, Qiu Shirong, Gao Yifan, Ren Xiuyun, Xia Yunqiu... all of whom are excellent in singing, reciting, acting, and acrobatics. We are especially happy not only to see the older generation remain youthful, but also to see the vibrant new forces!

    Guan Su Shuang has come to Beijing and performed abroad several times since liberation, and is a relatively familiar actor to the audience in the capital. She is versatile and skilled in both civil and military roles, able to perform "Cosmic Frontier" and "Yutang Chun" in civil roles, and "Hujiazhuang" and "Sizhou City" in military roles, and she performs them all extremely well. This is because she not only has superior natural conditions (beautiful appearance, broad and bright voice), but also is willing to study hard and practice diligently. Her spirit of hard study and diligent practice can be regarded as a leader among the young actors we have come into contact with. She knows many plays. In the early days of liberation, she not only played Qingyi, Hua Dan, and Dao Ma Dan, but also played Xiaosheng and Wusheng roles. Her performances as Zhou Yu in "Chaisang Pass" and Jin Qianbao in "Hongmei Mountain" were both above average. Later, in order to more fully utilize her talents, she stopped performing Xiaosheng and Wusheng roles.

    This time in Beijing, she performed "Huo Sanniang," "Mu Kezhai," "Battle of Hongzhou," "Generals of the Yang Family," and "Legend of the White Snake." These programs fully demonstrate her artistic versatility. For example, in "Huo Sanniang," her skill with weapons is stable and fast, and coordinated with the music, the rhythm is clear; what is especially rare is that it is clean and neat, with clear lines. The few "somersaults" at the beginning are very good, the spear flowers are both stable and accurate, and with her sweet and bright voice, a set of Kunqu opera is sung with ease, pleasant and beautiful; another example is "Stealing the Immortal Herb," which integrates the extremely heavy "sword duel" acrobatics into the singing of "Gao Bozi," singing and fighting at the same time, creating a unique style. The entire "Legend of the White Snake" is both civil and military. Without comprehensive skills, it would not be possible to be so competent and enjoyable. In the three plays "Mu Kezhai," "Battle of Hongzhou," and "Generals of the Yang Family," she portrayed the magnificent life of Mu Guiying. Not only is her singing, reciting, acting, and acrobatics skilled and stable, but she also pays great attention to the changes in the character's image, grasping both the common characteristics of Mu Guiying's personality from youth to old age, and the different characteristics of her personality and emotions in different situations due to age and experience. It is very profound and moving.

    Xu Minchu is also an all-rounder who can perform "Dingjun Mountain" in a martial role and "Striking the Drum and Cursing Cao" in a civil role. He originally followed the Yan school and also worked on the Qi school. The "Bo Ya Smashes the Zither," also known as "Ma'anshan," performed this time, is a general traditional Peking Opera repertoire that has long been reduced to a cold play for many years. This time, after sorting and processing, he boldly used the Yan school singing style, especially Xu Minchu's voice, which is old, tough, and flavorful, and his delicate expression, made this cold play shine. In recent years, the Peking Opera stage has been rich, full, and lively, which is certainly good; however, there seem to be fewer plays with a quiet style. Some authors and directors often pursue the tension of the plot and the fiery artistic expression too much, and do not like quiet plays or are not good at handling lyrical scenes. The plot conflict of "Bo Ya Smashes the Zither" is not very sharp, and the movements and gestures are not very heavy, but through lyrical singing, it can also be moving and thought-provoking. Qiu Shirong is the younger brother of Qiu Shengrong, and his voice and movements are very similar to his brother. In his starring role of "Drunken Wei" (a part of "Battle of Wancheng"), he adapted the original Kunqu opera style into Peking Opera, which shows great ingenuity. Although the plot is simple, through heavy movements and superb performance skills, he highlights the brave character of Dian Wei. However, there is still much room for improvement in the directorial handling of this play. For example, Zhang Xiu invites Dian Wei to the camp to drink and become sworn brothers, with the aim of eliminating a strong enemy, but before Dian Wei goes to the camp, Zhang Xiu and Jia Xu's secret planning is not clearly explained enough. When Zhang Xiu exaggerates Dian Wei's bravery, Dian Wei only "listens" to the long speech, neither speaks nor urges him to drink, and after Dian Wei finishes speaking, he does not drink much wine before becoming drunk. Things like this are worth working on with careful and meticulous effort.

    This troupe has two Cheng school Qingyi, one is Liu Meijuan, and the other is Xia Yunqiu. In "Peacock Gall," Liu Meijuan vividly portrays the beautiful and kind woman image of Princess Age, especially in the final scene of "Drinking Poison in Dongsi Temple," her singing is truly like a cuckoo weeping blood, fully demonstrating the characteristics of Cheng school art. In "Jiangyou Pass," Xia Yunqiu plays the wife of Ma Miao. She has new creations based on the Cheng singing style, and her movements and water sleeves show considerable skill.

    I remember that in 1956, they came to Beijing to perform "Ahei and Ashima," a play that reflected the life of ethnic minorities, and made new attempts at Peking Opera reform. This time, they also brought "Duosha Abo" and "Princess Wencheng," which reflect the life of ethnic minorities, and will be staged soon, which will surely create a new look for Peking Opera art.

    The Peking Opera Troupe of Yunnan Province, like fraternal troupes across the country, is working hard to implement the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, weed through the old to bring forth the new." They not only attach importance to inheriting tradition, but also are determined to promote tradition. Even if it is a traditional repertoire that has long been established, they will never stick to conventions; and on the basis of tradition, they dare to carry out reforms and new creations. This path of development is the correct path.

    Ten years of experience have proved that Peking Opera and various operas can only gain new life if they dare to carry out correct and bold "weeding through the old to bring forth the new" in terms of ideological content and artistic form. The road of opera reform is not smooth. It has developed and prospered in the extremely complex and sharp struggle with national nihilism that obliterates tradition and national essentialism that opposes development. In addition, within our literary and art circles, we also need to constantly overcome crude and conservative phenomena. It is wrong to blindly reform in art without regard to the rules; however, it is also wrong to stick to conventions and stagnate. There has long been a "valuing the past and belittling the present" argument in the Peking Opera world. It underestimates the potential and achievements of young actors, and at every turn it is about how Tan Xinpei was, how Yang Xiaolou was, how Chen Delin was, how Gong Yunfu was, and any slight change or development is called deceiving the teacher and destroying the ancestors! Of course, without a doubt, the art of these predecessors must be respected and seriously inherited; but predecessors should never become a shackle for the progress of future generations, and we cannot use the so-called "model" of the predecessors to scare away later learners. According to the laws of objective development, no matter how conservative people are subjectively, those who move forward are still moving forward, and this cannot be absolutely bound. At present, many aspects of the Peking Opera world have already surpassed Tan, Yang, Chen, Gong... This is a fact that cannot be ignored. If Peking Opera is to develop, it must first break this superstition. "The student surpasses the teacher," is the law of social development, and also the law of artistic development. The process of "weeding through the old to bring forth the new" is also a process of continuous revolution.

    The Yunnan Province Peking Opera Troupe not only earnestly respects tradition, but also boldly breaks superstitions and dares to innovate. This daring and proactive communist style is worthy of praise. I wholeheartedly cheer for the sharp progress of this new force!

    一支生力军
    ——云南省京剧演出观后
    马少波
    我国京剧艺术，从很早就有全国影响。解放以来，在党的“百花齐放，推陈出新”的方针指导下，不仅是普及全国各地，而且各省市、
  自治区的京剧团，在艺术上都有了蓬勃的发展。云南省京剧团，虽然远处于祖国边疆；但是，他们有相当强大的阵容，并具有很高的艺术水平。毫无疑问，这支队伍是我国京剧界的劲旅之一。
    这次进京的云南省京剧演出团的演员中，有些同志在抗战时期，就是艺术上锐意改革而且以京剧这一武器为政治服务的。例如徐敏初同志，远在1939年，就在田汉同志领导的平剧宣传队工作，他是第一个扮演“江汉渔歌”中的阮复成的演员；再如金素秋同志，从1943年就和田汉同志合作，田本“白蛇传”首次上演，就是她扮演的白素贞。这些同志的劳绩，人们是不会忘却的。这次和他们一起进京的还有前辈艺人刘奎官同志，刘奎官的武净，独树一帜，特别是他的“通天犀”，算得是当世一绝。此外，还有许多优秀的青年演员，如关鹔鹴刘美鹃、裘世戎、高一帆、任岫云、夏韵秋……都是唱念作打出色，文武昆乱不挡。我们不仅看到老一辈青春常在；而且看到了朝气焕发的新生力量，心里特别高兴！
    关鹔鹴，解放以来曾经几次进京和出国演出，是首都观众比较熟悉的演员，她一专多能，艺兼文武，文能“宇宙锋”、“玉堂春”；武能“扈家庄”、“泗州城”，而且都演的极好。这是由于她既有优越的天赋条件（扮像秀美，嗓音宽亮），而且肯于苦学勤练，她的苦学勤练的精神，在我们接触的青年演员中，算得是个中翘楚。她能戏很多，在解放初期，她不但演青衣、花旦、刀马旦；同时也演小生戏和武生戏，她演的“柴桑关”的周瑜和“红梅山”的金钱豹，都在水平以上。后来因为要比较集中地发挥她的才能，小生和武生戏才不演了。
    这次进京，她演出了“扈三娘”、“穆柯寨”、“战洪州”、“杨门女将”、“白蛇传”。这几个节目，充分表现了她在艺术上全才的特点。例如“扈三娘”的把子工夫，稳而且快，配合曲子，节奏鲜明；尤其难得的是干净俐落，线条清楚。起霸的几个“鹞子翻身”，好的很，枪花既稳且准，加以嗓音甜亮，一套昆曲，唱得游刃有余，悦耳动听；再如“盗仙草”，把极繁重的“对剑”把子，融化在“高拨子”的唱工之中，边唱边打，别树风格，一部“白蛇传”，允文允武，假如没有全面工夫，不可能如此胜任愉快。“穆柯寨”、“战洪州”、“杨门女将”三出戏，她表现了穆桂英的壮丽的一生，不但是唱念作打，纯熟稳练，而且她十分注重人物形象的变化，既掌握穆桂英从青年到晚年在性格上的一脉相通的特点，又掌握了由于年龄和阅历的增长在不同的情境中性格感情的不同特征，是非常深刻动人的。
    徐敏初也是武演“定军山”，文演“击鼓骂曹”的全才，他原宗言派，兼工麒派。此次演出的“伯牙摔琴”，又名“马鞍山”，是京剧一般的传统剧目，多少年来，长期沦为冷戏。这次经过整理加工，大胆运用了言派唱工，特别是徐敏初的嗓音苍韧有味，表情细腻，使这出冷戏，放射光彩。近几年来，京剧舞台上，丰富饱满，火炽热闹，固然是好的；但是风格文静的剧目，似乎少了一点。有的作者和导演，往往过于追求情节的紧张和艺术表现的火炽，不大喜欢文静的剧目和不大善于处理抒情的场子。“伯牙摔琴”的剧情冲突，并不是很尖锐的，动作身段也不是很繁重的，但是通过抒情的歌唱，也能够动人心
  魄，发人深思。裘世戎是裘盛戎的胞弟，嗓音工架，很像乃兄。他主演的“醉韦”（“战宛城”的一折），将原来的昆曲路子，改编为京剧，颇见匠心。剧情虽然单纯，但通过了繁重的身段和精湛的表演技巧，突出了典韦勇悍的性格。不过这出戏在导演处理上，还大有加工的余地。例如张绣请典韦过营，饮酒结拜，目的是为了除却劲敌，可是在典韦过营之前，张绣和贾诩的密谋部署，交代的不够明确，张绣虚夸典韦勇武的时候，典韦的大段念白，张绣只是“旁听”而已，既不说话，也不劝酒，而典韦念完之后，并没有喝多少酒，就酩酊大醉了。诸如此类，还值得再下一番细针密线的功夫。
    这个演出团有两个程派青衣，一位是刘美鹃，一位是夏韵秋。刘美鹃在“孔雀胆”中，生动地塑造了阿盖公主这一美丽善良的妇女形象，特别是在末场“东寺饮酖”的演唱，真如杜鹃泣血，充分显示了程派艺术的特色。夏韵秋在“江油关”中饰马邈妻，她在程腔基础上有新创造，身段水袖，颇见功夫。
    记得在1956年，他们曾进京演出了表现少数民族生活题材的“阿黑与阿诗玛”，对京剧改革，进行了新的尝试。这次，他们还带来了表现少数民族生活题材的“多沙阿波”和“文成公主”，不日即将上演，一定会为京剧艺术别开生面。
    云南省的京剧团和全国的兄弟剧团一样，都在努力贯彻执行“百花齐放，推陈出新”的方针，他们既重视继承传统，又锐意发扬传统。那怕是早有定评的传统剧目，他们也绝不墨守成规；而且在传统的基础上，敢于进行改革和新的创造。这样的发展道路，是正确的道路。
    十年来的经验证明，京剧乃至各种戏曲之所以获得新的生命，必须在思想内容和艺术形式上，勇于进行正确而又大胆的“推陈出新”。戏曲改革的道路，并不是平坦的，它是在和抹煞传统的民族虚无主义、反对发展的国粹主义所进行的极其复杂尖锐的斗争中发展繁荣起来的。此外，在我们文艺界内部，也需要不断地克服粗暴和保守的现象。在艺术上不顾规律，盲目改革，是不对的；可是墨守成规，停滞不前，也是错误的。京剧界从早就有一种“厚古薄今”的论调，对于青年演员的潜力和成就估计不足，动不动就是谭鑫培如何，杨小楼如何，陈德霖怎么样，龚云甫又怎么样，稍有变动和发展，就叫欺师灭祖！当然毫无疑问，这些前辈的艺术，必须尊重，并且要认真的继承；但是前辈绝不应成为后辈前进的桎梏，不能拿所谓前人的“典范”把后学吓退。按照客观发展的规律，不管人的主观上如何保守，前进者仍然在前进，这是绝对束缚不住的。目前京剧界有很多方面，已然超越了谭、杨、陈、龚……这是不可不加以正视的事实。京剧要发展，就要首先打破这种迷信。“青出于蓝，而胜于蓝”，是社会发展的规律，也是艺术发展的规律。“推陈出新”的过程，同样是不断革命的过程。
    云南省京剧演出团，既认真地尊重传统，而又大胆地破除迷信，勇于革新，这种敢想敢作的共产主义风格，值得赞扬。我由衷的为这一支生力军的锐意精进而欢呼！
