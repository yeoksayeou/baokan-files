Xinhua News Agency, Gagela (Caucasus), November 24th: According to TASS, Soviet Council of Ministers Chairman Khrushchev hosted a banquet for Guinean Republic President Touré at his Black Sea villa on the 23rd. Khrushchev is currently vacationing there.

At the banquet, Khrushchev said, "We know how difficult it is to achieve freedom. However, maintaining and consolidating the freedom already obtained is also not easy. People who have waged selfless struggles for their own liberation are now celebrating their victory. People have struggled to be the masters of their own destiny and wealth, and they hope to live well. This must be achieved, and then the working people will actively support their government."

President Touré said in his reply that the Guinean people are filled with the determination to achieve economic, cultural, and social progress. He expressed his sincere gratitude to the Soviet people for their help and support to the Guinean people in their struggle to break away from colonial oppression and for national liberation.

    赫鲁晓夫欢宴几内亚总统
    杜尔感谢苏联人民的帮助和支持
    新华社莫斯科24日电　据塔斯社加格拉（高加索）讯：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫23日在黑海边的别墅设宴招待几内亚共和国总统杜尔。赫鲁晓夫正在那里休假。
    赫鲁晓夫在宴会上说，我们知道，取得自由是多么不容易。但是，要保持住和巩固已经得到的自由也是不容易的。曾经为争取自己解放进行过忘我斗争的人们，现在正在庆祝自己的胜利。人们曾经为了作自己命运和财富的主人而斗争，他们希望生活得好。必须达到这一点，到那时，劳动人民就将积极地拥护自己的政府。
    杜尔总统致答词说，几内亚人民充满着要取得经济、文化和社会进步的决心。他对苏联人民给予几内亚人民的帮助、支持几内亚人民为摆脱殖民主义压迫和为民族解放而进行的斗争表示真诚的感谢。
    最后，杜尔祝苏联人民幸福和取得新的伟大成就，
