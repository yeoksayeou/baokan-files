Xinhua News Agency, 24th - According to TASS, New York: The United Nations General Committee hastily convened a meeting on the 23rd to discuss the U.S. delegation's recommendation to include a supplementary item – the notorious so-called "Hungarian question" – on the agenda of the current session of the General Assembly.

    U.S. Representative Lodge spoke first at the meeting. He insisted that the committee recommend that the General Assembly include this "question" on the agenda, but he could not provide any even slightly convincing reasons. He only used a letter from the so-called UN "Special Representative on the Hungarian Question," Munro, to the UN Secretary-General and a resolution that was brutally forced through the General Assembly at its thirteenth session as pretexts.

    Hungarian People's Republic representative Peter, who was invited to attend the committee meeting, then spoke, firmly opposing the attempt to once again impose this fundamentally non-existent "question" on the General Assembly. Peter said that putting forward this agenda item "means another attempt to manufacture a Cold War and incite sabotage." The Hungarian representative emphasized that, from a legal point of view, the U.S. delegation's proposal is completely contrary to the UN Charter and rules of procedure; and from a political point of view, it could complicate the international situation. He demanded that the General Committee reject the U.S. proposal.

    The Hungarian People's Republic representative's speech was supported by the representatives of Czechoslovakia, the Soviet Union, and Romania.

    Soviet delegation leader Kuznetsov strongly protested the attempt to force the so-called "Hungarian question" onto the agenda of the current session of the United Nations General Assembly. Kuznetsov emphasized that discussing this "question" in the United Nations is a blatant interference in Hungary's internal affairs and a flagrant violation of the UN Charter.

    Kuznetsov concluded by saying that the obligation of everyone who truly desires to further improve the international situation is to: stop inciting the "Cold War" in the United Nations, and prevent anyone from causing the United Nations to evade the solution of international issues that are of great significance in maintaining and strengthening peace.

    The General Committee voted by a majority to recommend that the General Assembly include the "Hungarian question" on the agenda. The Soviet, Romanian, and Czechoslovak delegations voted against. The Moroccan and Indonesian delegations abstained.

    Xinhua News Agency, 24th - According to TASS, New York: The Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly began discussing the Korean question on the 23rd. Before the meeting were two proposals: the Soviet proposal that the committee invite representatives from both parts of Korea to participate in the discussion, and the U.S. proposal insisting on inviting only South Korean representatives to participate in the discussion.

    Soviet Representative Tugarinov said that the issue being discussed by the committee is closely related to the Korean people, who are suffering from the division of their country into two parts. He reminded the committee that the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has formally requested the United Nations General Assembly to allow it to send representatives to participate in the discussion of the Korean question at the current session of the General Assembly.

    The Soviet proposal was supported by the representatives of Poland, Byelorussia, Ukraine, Czechoslovakia, Albania, and Burma.

    U.S. Representative Robertson firmly rejected the Soviet proposal and demanded that the U.S. proposal be voted on first.

    The committee passed the U.S. proposal by a majority of forty-nine votes. The delegations of socialist countries and the delegation of Burma voted against. Fifteen delegations abstained.

    联大总务委员会竟把“匈牙利问题”列入联大议程
    匈苏代表谴责美国煽动冷战
    政委会公然通过美国提案只邀请南朝鲜代表参加讨论朝鲜问题
    新华社24日讯　据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会总务委员会23日匆忙召开会议，讨论美国代表团关于把一个补充项目——臭名昭彰的所谓“匈牙利问题”列入本届大会议程的建议。
    美国代表洛奇首先在会上发言。他硬要委员会建议大会把这个“问题”列入议程，但是他又举不出任何那怕有一点说服力的理由来。他只以所谓联合国“匈牙利问题”特别代表孟罗给联合国秘书长的信件和在联合国大会第十三届会议上粗暴地强使大会通过的决议作为借口。
    应邀出席委员会会议的匈牙利人民共和国代表彼得接着发言，他坚决反对再次把这个根本不存在的“问题”强加给大会的企图。彼得说，提出这项议程“意味着又一次制造冷战和煽动破坏活动”。匈牙利代表强调指出，从法律观点上看，美国代表团的建议是同联合国宪章和程序规则完全背道而驰的；而从政治观点上看，它可能使国际局势复杂化。他要求总务委员会拒绝美国的建议。
    匈牙利人民共和国代表的发言得到捷克斯洛伐克、苏联和罗马尼亚代表的支持。
    苏联代表团团长库兹涅佐夫对企图硬把所谓“匈牙利问题”列入联合国大会本届会议的作法提出强烈抗议。库兹涅佐夫强调指出，在联合国讨论这个“问题”是对匈牙利内政的粗暴干涉，是公然违背联合国宪章。
    库兹涅佐夫最后说，一切真正渴望进一步改善国际局势的人的义务就是：制止在联合国中煽动“冷战”，防止有人使联合国回避对在维护和加强和平方面有重大意义的国际问题的解决。
    总务委员会以多数票建议大会把“匈牙利问题”列入议程。苏联、罗马尼亚和捷克斯洛伐克代表团投票反对。摩洛哥和印度尼西亚代表团弃权。
    新华社24日讯　据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会政治委员会23日开始讨论朝鲜问题。摆在会议面前的有两个提案：苏联建议委员会邀请朝鲜两部分的代表参加讨论的提案以及美国坚持只邀请南朝鲜的代表参加讨论的提案。
    苏联代表图加里诺夫说，委员会讨论的问题同身受国家被分割成两部分之害的朝鲜人民有切身关系。他提醒委员会注意，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府已经正式要求联合国大会允许它派代表参加大会本届会议对朝鲜问题的讨论。
    苏联的提案得到波兰、白俄罗斯、乌克兰、捷克斯洛伐克、阿尔巴尼亚和缅甸代表的支持。
    美国代表罗伯逊坚决拒绝苏联的提案，并且要求首先表决美国提案。
    委员会以四十九票多数通过了美国提案。社会主义国家代表团和缅甸代表团投反对票。十五个代表团弃权。
