Since the beginning of this year, Tangjiazhuang Mine of Kailuan Coal Mine in Hebei Province has continued to hold high the red flag of the General Line and the Great Leap Forward, constantly opposing right-leaning ideology and right-leaning sentiments. All the mine's employees have maintained vigorous revolutionary fighting spirit from beginning to end, achieving large-area high-yield production every month.

From January to October this year, the entire mine produced more than 110,000 tons of coal for the country; the ash content of raw coal was 0.13% lower than the national plan; the cost of raw coal was 7.31% lower than the national plan; labor productivity was 4.2% higher than the national plan; and the four major disasters of water, fire, wind, and dust, as well as major and severe accidents, were eliminated, ensuring safe production. Now, the mine's annual output is equal to ten times that of 1949 and three times that of 1953. This is a victory for the employees of Tangjiazhuang Mine in defending the General Line under the leadership of the Party, a victory for adhering to continued leaps forward, and also a victory for vigorously launching mass movements.

Breaking "Old Routines" and Creating a New Situation

At the beginning of this year, the mine's Party committee was considering how to break the so-called "routines" of "slack at the beginning of the year and tight at the end; slack at the beginning of the month and tight at the end." They found that the production fluctuations of slackness at the beginning of the year and month, and tense spurts at the end of the year and month, were a major loophole in their work. This phenomenon of sharp rises and falls caused significant losses in production. If this "old routine" was not changed, it would inevitably become an obstacle to continued leaps forward. They analyzed that the root cause of this "old routine" was the lack of forward-thinking in leadership and a manifestation of right-leaning ideology, not any "law," and it could be completely changed.

In response to this situation, the mine's Party committee, based on the spirit of the General Line and the experience of the Great Leap Forward last year, put forward the slogan "Strive for the top, strive for advancement, strive for first place, plant red flags, push all work forward, and tenaciously overcome all difficulties" as the guiding ideology for all employees to achieve continued leaps forward this year, and held a series of meetings to make arrangements, emphasizing "a red start" and "red every day," determined to reverse this "slack before, tight after" situation.

When the mine's Party committee put forward the slogan "push all work forward," it was warmly supported by the majority of cadres and workers. However, a few cadres believed that the leap forward last year was "almost enough," and that further leaps forward this year would pose problems in terms of equipment and manpower. In order to criticize this erroneous view of "reaching the peak of the leap forward," the mine's Party committee launched a mine-wide discussion and debate to summarize the work of 1958 among all employees. In the discussion and debate, the masses of workers cited a large number of facts to illustrate the favorable conditions for achieving this year's leap forward plan. For example, the experience of organizing high-yield workfaces, the improvement of workers' operational skills and cadres' ability to organize production, were extremely beneficial to the continued leap forward in production this year. At the same time, there was also great potential to be tapped in terms of equipment and manpower. After the debate, right-leaning conservative ideas and slack sentiments were powerfully criticized, boosting the greater enthusiasm of the workers, and immediately setting off a red flag competition craze of "everyone looking for opponents, and each level conducting counterpart competitions" throughout the mine. The result of the hard work was a powerful reversal of the historical "six slacks, six tights" ("slack at the beginning of the year, tight at the end; slack at the beginning of the season, tight at the end; slack at the beginning of the month, tight at the end; slack before holidays, tight after holidays; slack in the first shift, tight in the last shift; slack at the beginning of the shift, tight at the end of the shift") "routine," completing the first quarter's coal production plan four and a half days ahead of schedule, and achieving a new situation of "red every month," "red start," and "red before and after the Spring Festival"—a "complete red."

Timely Reversal of Right-Leaning Ideology

The "routine" of slackness at the beginning of the year was broken, and the production level continued to rise, with April increasing by 14% compared to January. However, in late May, when discussing the implementation of the plan, a gust of crooked wind blew again. At that time, among the members of the mine's Party committee, the majority adhered to the General Line and continued leaps forward, but some Party committee members also had conservative ideas and a fear of difficulty. Among some workshop cadres, there were also two conservative ideas: one was that workshops that had completed their tasks well were afraid of being taken advantage of and of being burdened by others; the other was that the reason for not completing the tasks was that the targets were too high, and even some district chiefs were therefore unwilling to be district chiefs of "large districts" (high-output districts).

This gust of crooked wind did not shake the mine Party committee's strong will to continue the leap forward. In order to unify their thinking and understanding, they first seriously studied the documents of the Party Central Committee, further clarifying that the Party organization of an enterprise, especially the Party's leading body, should play the role of a "promoter" in leading the masses to implement the General Line. They used the criteria of the General Line to measure the attitude that a primary-level Party organization should hold in implementing the policies of the higher-level Party organization. The mine Party committee decided to start with rectifying leadership ideology, summarizing and recalling the mine's work from January to May based on the spirit of the General Line. They further realized that the reason why they were able to comprehensively overfulfill their tasks every month in the previous stage was the result of constantly boosting morale and striving for the top. At the same time, they also thought that as the Party organization of an enterprise, in the case of plan implementation, the correct attitude should be: hold high the red flag of the General Line and the Great Leap Forward, lead the masses to continuously advance, and use the principle of "picking the fruit by jumping a bit" as the standard for "plan implementation." Therefore, it was decided to further implement the guiding ideology of "three strivings," "one planting," "one pushing forward," and "one overcoming" put forward by the mine Party committee at the beginning of the year, and to hold the red flag of the General Line even higher.

After the mine Party committee unified its thinking, it immediately convened a meeting of workshop cadres and a meeting of all cadres, criticizing ideas such as fear of being taken advantage of and fear of difficulties, and repeatedly calculated several economic accounts: from the perspective of the entire mine, the fact that the tasks were comprehensively overfulfilled every month itself powerfully illustrated that the plan itself was implementable; from the perspective of each workshop, the vast majority of workshops completed their tasks, and only individual workshops did not complete their monthly plans, and the workshops that failed to complete their tasks were precisely those with more serious right-leaning conservatism and fear of difficulty. The mine Party committee used a comparative method, listing the achievements of the No. 3 coal mining district in fully utilizing the subjective initiative of the people to stubbornly overcome difficulties and achieve overfulfillment of tasks every month, and the vivid examples of the No. 4 coal mining district emphasizing objective difficulties and willingly remaining in the lower reaches, thus often failing to complete tasks, in order to improve the understanding of plan implementation among workshop leading cadres. Because the reasoning was thorough and the facts were clear and conclusive, the grassroots cadres received a profound education and clearly recognized that plan implementation should be understood from a positive perspective.

Among all employees, the mine Party committee, on the one hand, spoke extensively about the situation, focusing on explaining the principle that plan implementation was for better leaps forward, thereby boosting the greater enthusiasm of the masses; on the other hand, it also promptly organized the masses of employees to conduct debates centering on the central content of "how to implement the plan" and "how to better overfulfill the tasks" using the method of extensive democracy, in order to unify their understanding.

Through these meticulous ideological work, erroneous views such as "implementation is not a leap forward" and "implementation means the lower the plan, the better" were powerfully criticized, and the production level steadily increased, with the daily output gradually increasing from 9,779 tons in May to 10,739 tons in September.

Adhering to Vigorously Launching Mass Movements

When discussing the issue of vigorously launching mass movements, the mine Party committee firmly believed: "The experience of the Great Leap Forward last year has fully demonstrated that mass movements can also be vigorously launched in industrial enterprises." They listed many vivid facts to criticize the erroneous argument of individual workshop cadres that "being afraid of disrupting production order by launching mass movements," and insisted on vigorously launching mass movements to achieve this year's continued leap forward. Their specific approach to organizing mass movements was: whenever there are difficulties or problems, tell the masses; not only tell them, but also tell them extensively; not only tell them, but also mobilize the masses to solve them. The mine Party committee believed that when the masses understand the situation, they will try every possible means to overcome the difficulties. At the beginning of this year, the supply of pit wood was quite tight, but after the mine Party committee told the masses about this situation, and also organized relevant workers such as district team leaders to visit the pit wood yard, a high tide of saving pit wood was immediately set off throughout the mine, and the consumption of pit wood quickly dropped from 22 cubic meters per thousand tons of coal produced to below 20 cubic meters, saving 500 cubic meters of pit wood in just one month.

From January to the present, the mine Party committee has conducted 13 sessions of extensive democracy closely linked to each other, focusing on the central work of each period, and organized all mine employees to offer suggestions and solutions to key production issues. The vast number of employees have put forward a total of 1,470,980 suggestions. In order to encourage the masses, they put forward timely battle slogans at the beginning of each month, which played an important role in stimulating the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses and encouraging them to move forward. The masses reflected: "The center is clear, the enthusiasm is high, and the energy is used in the right way!" Recently, after the employees of this mine achieved the slogan of "Daily output of 11,000 tons, resolutely catch up with Linxi!" in October, they put forward the slogan of "Break through the 12,000 mark, catch up with Linxi again; monthly advance of 13,000, strive for leadership in the mining area!" raising the leap forward plan of 11,000 tons per day in October to 12,300 tons in November, and the footage of tunneling has also greatly exceeded the leap forward plan. In order to maintain sustained high production, all mine employees worked hard for only two days and nights, and 100% of the dry mining workfaces and more than 90% of the tunneling workfaces implemented four-shift cross-operations, which generally increased the workers' rest time by two hours, and the efficiency increased by an average of 5%.

The development of mass movements has powerfully promoted the red flag competition movement. The number of groups participating in the red flag competition in the entire mine has increased from 352 in January to the current 608, accounting for 99% of the 615 groups in the entire mine, and the number of people participating in the competition has accounted for more than 98% of the total number of people in the entire mine, and the forms of competition have reached as many as 15, truly achieving "everyone has an opponent, and each level has a counterpart." The workers reflected: "If there is no competition that day, production will not be energized."

The development of the competition has powerfully changed the relationship between people in production, and the spirit of communist large-scale collaboration between units, between shifts, and between people has been greatly promoted. The slogans "Leave the difficulties to yourself, and give the good conditions to others!" and "Mutual support in times of difficulty" are spreading everywhere. Arriving early to help the shift clean up floating coal and preparing for production for the next shift at the end of the shift have become a common phenomenon in the various coal mining workfaces of this mine. Previously, each shift hid good tools for their own use, but now they all actively support others.

The red flag competition has also promoted the development of the technical innovation movement. Since the beginning of this year, a total of 112 advanced experiences have been promoted throughout the mine, increasing the monthly progress of the coal mining workface from 61.3 meters in January to 95.62 meters in September; and increasing the daily footage of tunneling from 267 meters in January to 366 meters in September. Hydraulic mining has increased more than ten times compared to the past in just over a year, basically solving the technical problems of the entire hydraulic mining production process, and the proportion of hydraulic mining has reached about 40%.

    歪风刮不倒　永远争上游
    ——介绍河北省开滦煤矿唐家庄矿大面积高额丰产经验
    今年以来，河北省开滦煤矿唐家庄矿继续高举总路线、大跃进的红旗，不断反对右倾思想和右倾情绪，全矿职工从始至终保持了旺盛的革命斗志，月月获得大面积高额丰产。
    今年1至10月，全矿共给国家多生产了十一万多吨煤；原煤灰分比国家计划降低了0.13％；原煤成本比国家计划降低了7.31％；劳动生产率比国家计划提高了4.2％；消灭了水、火、风、尘四大灾害和重大恶性事故，保证了安全生产。现在，这个矿的年产量已经等于1949年的十倍；等于1953年的三倍。这是唐家庄矿职工在党的领导下捍卫总路线的胜利，是坚持继续跃进的胜利，也是大搞群众运动的胜利。
    破“老常规”创新局面
    今年年初，这个矿的党委就在考虑如何打破“年初松，年末紧；月初松、月末紧”的所谓“常规”的问题。他们发现历年来年初月初松劲、年末月末紧张突击的生产波动现象是工作中的一个大漏洞。这种骤升骤降现象给生产上造成了很大的损失。这个“老常规”如果不改变，必然会成为继续跃进的障碍。他们分析了造成这种“老常规”的根本原因是领导上缺乏一切工作往前赶的思想，是右倾思想的表现，不是什么“规律”，是完全可以改变的。
    针对这种情况，这个矿的党委根据总路线的精神和去年大跃进的经验，提出了“争上游，争先进，争第一，插红旗，一切工作往前赶，顽强地克服一切困难”的口号，作为全体职工实现今年继续跃进的指导思想，并召开了一系列会议作了部署，强调“开门红”“日日红”，下决心扭转这种“前松后紧”的局面。
    当矿党委提出“一切工作往前赶”的口号时，受到了大多数干部和工人的热烈拥护；但是也有少数干部认为去年跃进得“差不多”了，今年再跃进，在器材设备和人力上都有问题。为了批判这种“跃进到顶”的错误观点，矿党委在全体职工中展开了一个全矿性的总结1958年工作的鸣放辩论。在鸣放辩论中，职工群众列举了大量事实来说明实现今年跃进计划的有利条件。比如，去年组织高产工作面的经验；工人操作水平和干部组织生产能力的提高，对今年的生产继续跃进都极为有利；同时，在器材设备和人力上也都大有潜力可挖。经过辩论，有力地批判了右倾保守思想和松劲情绪，鼓起了职工群众的更大干劲，在全矿范围内立即掀起了一个“人人找对手，层层进行对口赛”的红旗竞赛热潮。奋战结果，有力地扭转了历史性的“六松、六紧”（年初松、年末紧；季初松、季末紧；月初松、月末紧；节前松、节后紧；第一班松、末班紧；班初松、班末紧）的“常规”，提前四天半完成了第一季度产煤计划，并实现了“月月红”“开门红”“春节前后红”的“满堂红”的新局面。
    及时反掉右倾思想
    年初松劲的“常规”打破了，生产水平持续地上升，4月份比1月份提高了14％。但是到了5月下旬，当讨论计划落实时，却又刮起了一阵歪风。当时在矿党委成员中，多数是坚持总路线、坚持继续跃进的，但在少数党委委员中也有着保守思想和畏难情绪。在部分车间干部中，也存在着两种保守思想：一种是完成任务好的车间怕吃亏、怕背别人，一种是认为完不成任务是因为指标高了，甚至有的区长因此而不愿再当“大区”（产量高的区）的区长。
    这阵歪风并没有动摇矿党委继续跃进的坚强意志。他们为了统一思想、统一认识，首先认真地学习了党中央的文件，进一步明确了作为一个企业的党组织、特别是党的领导机构在领导群众贯彻执行总路线的过程中应该起“促进派”的作用。他们以总路线的准则来衡量一级党组织执行上级党组织的方针政策应持的态度。矿党委决定先从整顿领导思想作起，根据总路线的精神来总结和回忆了全矿1至5月份的工作。进一步认识到前一段所以能够月月全面超额地完成任务，是不断鼓干劲、争上游的结果。同时，又想到作为企业的党组织，在计划落实的情况下，正确的态度应该是：高举总路线和大跃进的红旗，领导群众不断前进，以“跳一跳把果子摘下来”的原则来作为“计划落实”的标准。于是，决定再进一步深入贯彻矿党委在年初提出的“三争”“一插”“一赶”“一克”的指导思想，把总路线的红旗举得更高。
    矿党委思想统一以后，紧接着就召开了车间干部会和全体干部会，批判了怕吃亏、怕困难等思想，并反复地算了几笔经济账：从全矿看，月月全面超额完成任务的事实本身，已经有力地说明了计划本身就是落实的；从各个车间看，绝大多数车间完成了任务，只有个别车间没有完成月计划，而完不成任务的车间恰恰又是右倾保守和畏难情绪比较严重的车间。矿党委运用了对比的方法，列举了采煤三区充分发挥人的主观能动作用顽强克服困难而取得月月超额完成任务的成绩，和采煤四区强调客观困难甘居下游因而经常完不成任务的生动事例，来提高车间领导干部对计划落实的认识。由于道理讲得透彻、事实显明确凿，使基层干部受到了深刻的教育，明确认识到计划落实应从积极方面来理解。
    在全体职工中，矿党委一方面大讲形势，着重说明计划落实是为了更好的跃进的道理，从而鼓起群众更大的干劲；另一方面又及时地组织职工群众以大鸣大放的方法，围绕“计划如何落实”“如何更好地超额完成任务”等中心内容进行辩论，以统一认识。
    经过这些细致的思想工作，有力地批判了“落实就是不跃进”“落实就是计划越低越好”等错误观点，生产水平稳步上升，日产量由5月份的九千七百七十九吨逐步提高到9月份的一万零七百三十九吨。
    坚持大搞群众运动
    矿党委在讨论大搞群众运动的问题的时候，坚定地认为：“去年大跃进的经验已经充分地说明工业企业同样可以大搞群众运动。”他们列举了许多生动事实来批判个别车间干部的“怕搞群众运动把生产秩序打乱了”的错误论调，坚持主张大搞群众运动来实现今年的继续跃进。他们组织群众运动的具体作法是：只要有困难、有问题，就向群众讲；不仅要讲，而且要大讲特讲；不仅讲，还要发动群众去解决。矿党委认为：当群众了解了情况以后，就会千方百计地去克服困难。今年年初，坑木供应相当紧张，但是当矿党委把这种情况向群众讲了以后，又组织了区班长等有关工种到坑木场去参观，全矿马上掀起了一个节约坑木的高潮，坑木消耗很快地由每产一千吨煤消耗二十二立方米降低到二十立方米以下，仅一个月时间，就节约了五百立方米坑木。
    由今年1月到现在，这个矿党委围绕各个时期的中心工作，一环紧扣一环地搞了十三次鸣放，组织全矿职工人人献计献策，解决生产关键，广大职工共提出了一百四十七万零九百八十条意见。为了鼓舞群众，他们在每月月初都提出适时的战斗口号，这些口号对激发群众的革命热情和鼓舞群众前进起了重要作用。群众反映：“中心明确，干劲足，有劲使得对头！”最近这个矿的职工在10月份实现了“日产一万一，坚决赶林西！”的口号以后，又提出了“突破万二关，再把林西赶；月进一万三，矿区争领先！”的口号，把10月份日产一万一千吨的跃进计划提高到11月份的一万二千三百吨，掘进进尺也大大超过跃进计划。为了保持持久高产，全矿职工只苦战了两昼夜，就有百分之百的旱采工作面和90％以上的掘进工作面实行了四班交叉作业，使工人的休息时间普遍增加了两小时，效率平均提高了5％。
    通过群众运动的开展，有力地推动了红旗竞赛运动。全矿参加红旗竞赛的小组数已经由1月份的三百五十二个增加到当前的六百零八个，占全矿六百一十五个小组的99％，参加竞赛的人数已经占全矿总人数的98％以上，竞赛的形式达到了十五种之多，真正地作到了“人人有对手，层层有对口”。工人反映：“那一天不比赛，生产就提不起劲头来”。
    竞赛的开展，有力地改变了生产中人与人的关系，单位与单位间、班与班间、人与人间的共产主义大协作的精神大大发扬。“把困难留给自己，把好条件让给别人！”和“有困难互相支援”的口号到处传扬。早到的帮助上班打扫浮煤、班末给下班作好生产准备，已经在这个矿各个采煤工作面形成普遍现象。以前各班有好工具都藏起来留给自己用，现在都主动支援别人。
    红旗竞赛也推动了技术革新运动的开展。今年以来，全矿共推行了一百一十二种先进经验，使采煤工作面月进度由1月份的六十一点三米提高到9月份的九十五点六二米；掘进日进尺由1月份的二百六十七米提高到9月份的三百六十六米。水力采煤只用了一年多的时间就比过去提高了十几倍，基本上解决了全部水力采煤生产过程的技术问题，水力采煤比重已经达到40％左右。
