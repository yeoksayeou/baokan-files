Xinhua News Agency, November 17th dispatch from Pyongyang: The "Rodong Sinmun" of Korea published an editorial on the 12th entitled "The Sino-Indian Border Issue Must Be Resolved Peacefully," expressing full support for Premier Zhou Enlai's new proposal in his letter to Prime Minister Nehru regarding the withdrawal of the armies of China and India by twenty kilometers each and the holding of talks between the two Prime Ministers. The editorial stated that this proposal is the most appropriate and practical way to peacefully resolve the Sino-Indian border issue under the current situation.

The editorial stated that the Chinese government's repeated proposals to resolve the Sino-Indian border dispute through peaceful consultation reflect the peace-loving foreign policy consistently pursued by the People's Republic of China since its founding. The editorial said that despite the fact that the Indian government distorted the truth of the border issue in several notes to the Chinese government regarding border conflict incidents, the Chinese government has shown patience and repeatedly suggested peaceful solutions, which clearly demonstrates how sincere the Chinese government is in its efforts to ease international tensions and promote peace among the peoples of all countries. The Chinese government's position is fully in line with the wishes of all peace-loving people in Asia and the world. The editorial emphasized that if the Indian government also stood on the same position as the Chinese government, the Sino-Indian border issue could be resolved peacefully and smoothly.

The editorial pointed out that the Sino-Indian border has not been demarcated in history. Therefore, it is necessary to resolve such issues fairly through peaceful consultation.

The editorial said that due to the unexpected intrusion of Indian armed personnel into Chinese territory in the western part of the Tibet region on October 20th and 21st, conflict incidents occurred again. It is regrettable that just as the Chinese government proposed to resolve the border issue peacefully through talks, the Indian government agreed to this, but such conflict incidents repeatedly occurred.

The editorial said that the ambiguous attitude of the Indian side on the border issue and the repeated occurrence of conflict incidents cannot but further complicate the Sino-Indian border issue. This is detrimental to the interests of the people of China and India, or to the interests of peace in Asia and the world.

The editorial said that we cannot but note that the common enemies of the Asian people—the imperialists—are attempting to use the Sino-Indian border dispute to achieve their aggressive goals, and are therefore desperately creating discord between the two countries. It is clear that if the dispute between China and India continues, the imperialists will reap the benefits.

The editorial pointed out that the close cooperation between the newly emerging independent countries of Asia and Africa and the socialist camp countries headed by the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China is a reliable guarantee for these countries to oppose imperialism and colonialism and defend their national independence and development. Fostering discord between China and India will first and foremost greatly harm India's own interests.

The editorial said that the Indian government should prioritize its own national interests, should not allow the border dispute with China to continue, and should resolutely crush the imperialist conspiracy to use the Sino-Indian border dispute.

The editorial said that we believe that the adventurous and provocative anti-China movement stirred up by some forces in India must be stopped immediately. Because these actions not only cannot help solve the problem at all, but can only benefit the imperialists, this is crystal clear.

The editorial said that if the Indian government truly hopes to resolve the border issue peacefully, it must clear away this turbid atmosphere at home and exercise its influence to create a sound atmosphere.

The editorial hoped that the meeting between the Prime Ministers of the two countries as suggested by the Chinese government to solve the Sino-Indian border issue would be held soon. The editorial concluded by saying that the Korean people, together with all peace-loving people in Asia and the world, expect the Indian government to give a sincere response to the peace-loving initiatives repeatedly put forward by the Chinese government.

"Minju Choson" published a commentary on the 12th entitled "It is Necessary to Maintain the Traditional Friendship of One Billion People," saying that Premier Zhou Enlai's proposal is the most justified and timely proposal to quickly resolve the Sino-Indian border issue by peaceful means. We expect the Indian government to cherish the traditional friendship with China and accept this proposal.

The commentary said, "The Korean people, together with the people of Asia, sincerely hope that the Prime Ministers of China and India will gather together as soon as possible to reach a fair agreement in order to maintain the friendly relations between the two countries and consolidate peace."

The commentary said, "The fact that the government of the People's Republic of China has put forward such a most reasonable proposal for solving the border issue at an important time when the traditional friendly relations between the people of China and India are facing a severe test, once again proves that the government of the People's Republic of China has consistently made unremitting efforts for peace in Asia and friendship among the peoples, and how much it cherishes Sino-Indian friendship."

"Pyongyang News" has also expressed its hope that the Indian government will accept the sincere proposal of the Chinese government as soon as possible in response to the expectations of the people of Asia and the world who love peace.

Xinhua News Agency, November 17th dispatch from Tirana: The Albanian newspaper "Zeri i Popullit" published a commentary on the 14th entitled "A Reasonable Path to Resolve Differences," saying: The Albanian public, which is concerned with maintaining peace and consolidating international cooperation, welcomes the recent letter from Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai to Indian Prime Minister Nehru. The letter suggests holding immediate talks between the Prime Ministers of the two countries to discuss the Sino-Indian border issue and other issues in the relations between the two countries. This action will not only help eliminate misunderstandings and consolidate the good-neighborly relations between the two great countries of Asia, but will also be beneficial to world peace.

The commentary pointed out that the People's Republic of China has put forward a series of initiatives in accordance with the principles of peaceful coexistence in order to be friendly and cooperative with its neighbors, and it has contributed to extinguishing the sources of fire in Asia. All of this and the development of friendly relations between China and India have played a huge role in consolidating and strengthening the unity of the Asian people in their common struggle to strive for peace and oppose the aggressive plans of imperialists and colonialists. Life itself has educated the Asian people that the tighter they unite, the better they can defend their independence and peace and oppose the imperialist enslavement plans.

The commentary went on to point out that imperialism is attempting to restore colonialism where colonialism has been driven out. Therefore, some groups in Washington, London, and their supporters openly expressed their happiness about the Sino-Indian border incident, posing as if they were friends of India, and trying their best to use this incident to achieve their goals: creating divisions, changing India's neutral foreign policy, and, if possible, dragging India into a military aggression group. In order to serve the imperialist aggressive plans, Yugoslav officials joined the imperialist chorus. However, the slander of imperialist elements and their servants—the Belgrade revisionists—cannot belittle the peaceful policy of the People's Republic of China, nor can it deceive the Asian people.

The commentary concluded by saying that the wish of the great Chinese people is to live peacefully and friendly with their neighbor, India. The Albanian people, who are eager for good-neighborly relations between China and India forever, welcome this peaceful initiative of the People's Republic of China and consider it to be the most reasonable way to eliminate misunderstandings in Sino-Indian relations.

    朝鲜和阿尔巴尼亚报纸发表评论
    支持我国和平解决中印边界问题的倡议
    希望印度方面珍视中印友谊，停止一部分势力鼓动起来的反华挑衅
    新华社17日讯　平壤消息：朝鲜“劳动新闻”12日发表的题为“必须和平解决中印边界问题”的社论，表示完全支持周恩来总理在给尼赫鲁总理的信件中提出的关于中印两国军队各后撤二十公里以及两国总理举行会谈的新建议。社论说，这项建议是在目前形势下和平解决中印边界问题的最妥当和切实的途径。
    社论说，中国政府一再提出的关于用和平协商的方法来解决中印边界争端的倡议，体现了中华人民共和国建国以来一贯执行的爱好和平的对外政策。社论说，尽管印度政府在给中国政府的关于边界冲突事件的几次照会中有许多地方歪曲了边界问题的真相，中国政府仍然表现了忍耐性，并且一再建议要和平解决问题，这清楚地证明，中国政府为了缓和国际紧张局势和各国人民间的和平进行着多么真挚的努力。中国政府的立场是完全符合亚洲和世界一切爱好和平人民的意愿的。社论强调说，如果印度政府也站在同中国政府同样的立场上，就能够和平地、顺利地解决中印两国边界问题。
    社论指出，中印边界在历史上就没有划定过。因此必须通过和平协商的方法公正地解决这样的问题。
    社论说，由于印度的武装人员意外地在10月20日和21日侵入了西藏地区西部的中国领土，又发生了冲突事件。正在中国政府提出要通过会谈和平解决边界问题的建议的时候，印度政府对此表示同意，但却又使这样的冲突事件反复发生，这是令人遗憾的事情。
    社论说，印度方面对边界问题的含糊的态度和冲突事件的一再发生，不能不使中印边界问题进一步复杂化。这对中印两国人民的利益，或对亚洲和世界和平的利益都是不利的。
    社论说，我们不能不注意到亚洲人民的共同的敌人——帝国主义者企图利用中印边界争端来达到它的侵略目的，因此拼命制造两国间的不和。很显然，如果中印两国间的争端持续下去，帝国主义者就会坐收渔翁之利。
    社论指出，新生的亚非独立国家同以苏联和中华人民共和国为首的社会主义阵营国家紧密合作，是这些国家反对帝国主义和殖民主义、保卫本民族独立和发展的可靠保证，助长中印间的不和首先将大大损伤印度本身的利益。
    社论说，印度政府应该以本国的民族利益为重，不应该使同中国的边界争端继续下去，果断地粉碎帝国主义企图利用中印边界争端的阴谋。
    社论说，我们认为，必须立即停止印度一部分势力鼓动起来的冒险的挑衅的反华运动。因为这些行动不仅决不能帮助解决问题，而且只能对帝国主义者有利，这是清清楚楚的事情。
    社论说，如果印度政府真正希望和平解决边界问题，就必须清除国内的这种混浊的气氛，为造成健全的气氛行使它的影响力量。
    社论希望中国政府建议的为解决中印边界问题的两国总理的会谈早日举行。社论最后说，朝鲜人民同亚洲和全世界的一切爱好和平的人民一道，期待着印度政府对中国政府一再提出的爱好和平的倡议给予有诚意的答复。
    “民主朝鲜报”12日发表的题为“必须维护十亿人民的传统友谊”的评论说，周恩来总理的建议是用和平方法来迅速解决中印边界问题的最正当最适时的建议。我们期待印度政府珍视同中国的传统友谊，接受这项建议。
    评论说，“朝鲜人民同亚洲人民一道，衷心希望中印两国总理早日聚于一堂，为了维持两国间的友谊关系和巩固和平达成公正的协议。”
    评论说，“中华人民共和国政府在中印人民间的传统友谊关系面临严重的考验的重要时期，提出了这样的解决边界问题的最合理的建议的事实，又一次证明了中华人民共和国政府为亚洲的和平和人民间的友谊始终一贯地进行着不懈的努力，和它怎样地珍视中印友谊。”
    “平壤新闻”也表示希望印度政府早日接受中国政府的诚意的建议，以回答亚洲和全世界爱好和平人民的期望。
    新华社17日讯　地拉那消息：阿尔巴尼亚“人民之声报”14日以“解决意见分歧的合理道路”为题发表评论说：关心维护和平和巩固国际合作的阿尔巴尼亚公众，欢迎中国国务院总理周恩来最近致印度总理尼赫鲁的信。信中建议立即举行两国总理之间的会谈以讨论中印边界问题和两国关系中的其他问题，这一行动不仅有助于消除误解和巩固亚洲两个伟大国家的善邻关系，并且也有利于世界和平。
    评论指出，中华人民共和国为了同邻国友好和合作，曾按照和平共处的原则提出了一系列的倡议，它对扑灭亚洲的火源作出了贡献。所有这一切和中印两国之间的友好关系的发展，在巩固和加强亚洲人民在争取和平、反对帝国主义和殖民主义者的侵略计划的共同斗争中的团结方面起了巨大的作用。生活本身教育了亚洲人民，他们团结得愈紧就愈能更好地保卫他们的独立和和平，反对帝国主义的奴役计划。
    评论接着指出，帝国主义企图在殖民主义已被赶出的地方复辟殖民主义。所以华盛顿、伦敦的某些团体及其支持者对于中印边境事件公开地表示高兴，把自己扮成好像是印度的朋友似的，竭力利用这一事件来达到他们的目的：制造分裂，改变印度的中立外交政策，并且可能的话把印度拉入军事侵略集团。为了服务于帝国主义的侵略计划，南斯拉夫官方人士加入了帝国主义集团的大合唱。但是，帝国主义分子和他们的仆从——贝尔格莱德修正主义者——的诬蔑，并不能贬低中华人民共和国的和平政策，并不能欺骗亚洲人民。
    评论最后说，伟大中国人民的愿望是同邻邦印度和平和友好地生活。热望中印之间永远有着善邻关系的阿尔巴尼亚人民，欢迎中华人民共和国的这一和平的倡议，并认为它是消除中印关系上的误解的最合理的道路。
