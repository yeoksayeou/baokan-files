Jizhong Essays
Zhong Huai

Recently, I took a trip to the Jizhong Plain and visited seven counties and cities: Qingxu, Wenshui, Fenyang, Jiexiu, Pingyao, Taigu, and Yuci. Although the time was short, even a "cursory glance" would be an overstatement, what I saw and heard was still extremely rich and truly beautiful. Here are some fragmented impressions.

"This is not the first time"

The Three Autumns work (autumn harvesting, plowing and sowing) is busy, but it is being done in an orderly manner everywhere. Ren, the secretary of the Pingyao County Party Committee, summarized this year's Three Autumns work as: great enthusiasm, early start, fast speed, and high quality. This is not a unique feature of Pingyao, but a common feature of many regions. Taking the autumn harvest as an example, along the way we saw that except for cotton, which has not yet been harvested due to the long frost-free period this year, other crops have basically been harvested, and the harvest is fast and meticulous. Autumn sowing was advanced by one solar term to one month compared to last year, and many places have overfulfilled the wheat sowing plan. Based on summarizing last year's experience, reasonable close planting has been generally implemented. Large tracts of wheat fields have been leveled like vegetable gardens, and everywhere is a tempting new green.

After completing the autumn harvest and autumn sowing tasks in a timely manner, people are now delivering grain and selling grain in a concentrated manner. Along the way, we saw a constant stream of vehicles and horses transporting grain. Once the procurement task is completed, other work becomes more proactive. Each county has also made early arrangements for the work in the next few months: how many people will work on water conservancy, how many people will work on accumulating fertilizer, how many people will go to the mountains for "small autumn harvest", how many people will engage in sideline occupations, how many people will engage in short-distance transportation...

If asked why all this is done so quickly and well, with one link closely following another? The answer we received was: "Because of last year's Great Leap Forward experience," "Because this is not the first time." Yes, this is not the first time. What a valuable first time! With this first time, there will be a second time, a third time... and each time will be better than the last.

Oath-taking rally in Taoyuanpu

One clear, moonlit autumn night, we participated in an oath-taking rally in the Taoyuanpu Management Area of the Shahe Red Flag People's Commune in Taigu County.

Taoyuanpu was originally a management area in the Red Flag Commune that was relatively backward in production and poor in living conditions. But the people were not poor in ambition. This spring, with the inspiration and help of the county Party committee's working group and the commune Party committee, they made a vow to catch up with their wealthy neighbor, the Yangjiazhuang Management Area. Last year, Yangjiazhuang's average income per person reached 84 yuan, while Taoyuanpu's was only 48 yuan. Just comparing these two figures shows how ambitious Taoyuanpu is! As good as their word, after a year of hard work, this year the total income of the Taoyuanpu Management Area increased by 128% compared to last year, and public accumulation increased by 32 times; the average income per member reached 142.7 yuan, an increase of nearly two times compared to last year, and only 6.5 yuan less than Yangjiazhuang. Taoyuanpu is not giving way and is preparing to eliminate this small distance by developing sideline production this winter.

Now, the goal in front of the people of Taoyuanpu is no longer to catch up with Yangjiazhuang, but to surpass Yangjiazhuang and then catch up with Hupucun. Hupucun is the management area with the highest income in the commune over the years, with an income of 204 yuan per person this year, 61 yuan more than Taoyuanpu. It is not easy to catch up with Hupu, but as long as you participate in this oath-taking rally, you will believe that they will definitely achieve their goal. The enthusiastic speeches of the members at the oath-taking rally drove away the chill of the autumn night. As soon as the meeting ended, a deep plowing team composed of young and middle-aged farmers immediately carried their iron shovels and set off to the "Twenty-Four Mu" (place name) south of the village, to start the battle to achieve next year's goal.

Watching the members' shovels waving in the moonlight, I couldn't help but think of the lines "The silver hoes fall connected to the Five Ridges, the iron arms shake the Three Rivers". I seemed to see that every shovel was digging up the roots that were poor and white...

And how many management areas (production teams) with such great ambitions like Taoyuanpu should there be in the country! The secretary of the Taigu County Party Committee told us that 32 of the county's 42 backward management areas have changed their backward appearance this year. Relying on the superior system of the people's commune, people seem to have gained wings and are heading towards common prosperity.

The origin of the "Eight Eight Furnace"

We visited two 30-cubic-meter small blast furnaces at the Pingyao Dongguan Iron Plant. The workers skillfully operated with instruments, and many tasks were replaced by machines. The molten iron flowed smoothly...

The two blast furnaces stand like twin brothers in the field. They produce more than 50 tons of iron for the country every day and are already a fairly large "small foreign group". Just last year, this place was still a blank slate. The county Party secretary said meaningfully: "Before the large-scale iron and steel production last year, people did not recognize iron ore even when they saw it." It was the large-scale iron and steel production that made the people here recognize iron ore; it was the large-scale iron and steel production that enabled the people here to build many small native furnaces; it was the large-scale iron and steel production that enabled the people here to build two 30-cubic-meter small foreign furnaces with their own hands. Before the large-scale iron and steel production, Pingyao County basically only had light industry; today, the output value of heavy industry has reached 44.8% of the total industrial output value.

However, the daily output of this iron factory in early August this year was not more than 50 tons, but 13 tons. It turned out that there was only one furnace at that time - the Red Flag Furnace was in production; the other furnace had not been put into production because people thought there were many difficulties and the conditions were not available. As soon as the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party was conveyed, everyone opposed right-leaning thinking and boosted their morale, overcoming all the difficulties. This blast furnace was put into the battle of iron and steel in the posture of a new soldier. The factory then named it "Eight Eight Furnace", indicating that it was a product of implementing the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee.

What a perfect name! Along the way, we have heard and witnessed how profound and tremendous changes the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee has caused in life. Comrades from Jiexiu County told us that their work there has changed greatly since August, getting better and better, and each month is better than the last. For example, the production of coke has risen steadily since August, the number of people has not increased, but the output has increased by half. Such examples are everywhere. Talking about the emotions of cadres and the masses after opposing right-leaning thinking, people said with passion: "The enthusiasm for the large-scale steelmaking has come up again!" Women in some places are preparing cotton clothes and shoes, preparing to work hard in winter production this winter.

Hard battle and sweet battle

One night, we stayed in the Jiajiazhuang Management Area of the Wannianqing Commune in Fenyang County. In the rural night, life is still boiling. The county held a broadcast conference to exchange advanced experience. The management area was also holding a meeting to study current production. Some members were peeling corn. We heard a long and loud burst of laughter erupting among a group of members peeling corn. We were attracted and walked closer. It turned out that a member was telling a joke. Presumably the joke he was telling was very fascinating, otherwise how could it have caused such a widespread and enthusiastic response? Unfortunately, because of the language barrier, I was unable to understand it.

Another afternoon, we visited the Baisen Management Area of the Xiangyuan Commune in Pingyao County, and we also saw people working hard and singing cheerfully and talking about kuaiban (a type of rhythmic storytelling). Each production team in this management area has three members: a newspaper reader, a cultural counselor, and a song leader. The club often has activities such as reading newspapers, reading books, singing, and speaking kuaiban. Their cultural life is so active that some young people who initially left their hometowns because they were not content with rural work were later attracted back.

We often see such scenes: both tense labor and joyful labor. We said to a member: "Your spirit of hard battle is very good." He replied disapprovingly: "No, it's not a hard battle, it's a sweet battle!"

Yes, when people consciously and voluntarily work hard for their better life, when people have already tasted the sweet fruits from hard work, why is this labor not also sweet and joyful at the same time?

Some right-leaning opportunists who call themselves Communist Party members say that "hard battle is terrible." How far are they pulled down by ordinary commune members!

    晋中随笔
    钟怀
    最近在晋中平原走了一趟，访问了清徐、文水、汾阳、介休、平遥、太谷、榆次等七个县市。虽说时间很短，就连“走马看花”也谈不上，所见所闻仍极丰富，真是美不胜收。下面记下了一些片断的印象。
    “这不是第一次”
    三秋工作是繁忙的，但是各地都做得那么井然有序。平遥县委任书记这样概括今年的三秋工作：干劲大，动手早，速度快，质量高。这不是平遥一地的特点，而是许多地区的共同特点。拿秋收来说，一路上我们看到除棉花因为今年无霜期长尚未收完外，其他作物基本上已收割完毕，收得又快又细。秋种比去年提早了一个节令到一个月，好些地方都超额完成了种麦计划，并在总结去年经验的基础上普遍实行了合理密植，大块大块的麦田被平整得如同菜园一般，处处是一片诱人的新绿。
    在适时完成秋收和秋种任务以后，人们正以突击的姿态交粮和售粮。一路上只见送粮的车马络绎不绝。征购任务一完成，其他工作就更主动了。对于今后几个月的工作各县也都早作安排：多少人搞水利，多少人搞积肥，多少人上山“小秋收”，多少人搞副业，多少人搞短途运输……
    若问这一切为什么做得既快且好，一环紧扣着一环？我们得到的回答是：“因为有了去年的跃进经验”，“因为这不是第一次了”。是的，这不是第一次了。多么可贵的第一次！有了这第一次，才有第二次、第三次……而且是一次比一次更好。
      桃园堡誓师
    一个月白风清的深秋之夜，我们在太谷县沙河红旗人民公社桃园堡管理区，参加了一次誓师大会。
    桃园堡原是红旗公社一个生产比较落后、生活比较贫困的管理区。但是人穷志不穷。今年春天在县委工作组和公社党委的启发、帮助下，他们立下志愿，要赶上富裕的邻居——杨家庄管理区。去年杨家庄每人平均收入达八十四元，而桃园堡才四十八元。只消比较一下这两个数字，就可看出桃园堡的雄心有多么大！说到做到，经过一年的努力，今年桃园堡管理区总收入比去年增长了128％，公共积累增长了三十二倍；社员平均每人收入达到一百四十二元七角，比去年增加了将近两倍，同杨家庄相较，只差六元五角。而桃园堡一着不让，准备在今冬从开展副业生产方面，消灭这微小的距离。
    现在，摆在桃园堡的人们面前的目标，已经不是赶上杨家庄，而是超过杨家庄，进而赶上浒濮村了。浒濮村是这个公社历年收入最高的管理区，今年每人收入二百零四元，比桃园堡多六十一元。要赶上浒濮，可不简单，但是你只要参加这个誓师大会，就会相信他们一定能达到目的。誓师大会上社员们热气腾腾的发言，驱走了秋夜的寒意。会议刚一结束，一支由青壮年农民组成的深翻队伍，立即扛着铁锨，开赴村南的“二十四亩”（地名），展开了为实现明年目标的战斗。
    看着社员们的铁锨在月光下挥动，我不禁想起“天连五岭银锄落，地动三河铁臂摇”的诗句。我仿佛看到每一锨都挖起了那又穷又白的根子……
    而像桃园堡这样具有雄心大志的管理区（生产队），在全国该有多少呵！太谷县委书记告诉我们，全县四十二个落后的管理区，今年就有三十二个改变了落后面貌。凭借着人民公社的优越制度，人们像是平添了双翼，奔向共同富裕。“八八炉”的由来
    我们在平遥东关铁厂参观了两座三十立方米的小高炉。工人们熟练地凭着仪表进行操作，许多工作用机械代替了人工，铁水顺利地奔流着……
    两座高炉像一对孪生子那样矗立在田野，它们每天为国家生产五十多吨铁，已经是颇具规模的“小洋群”了。就是这里，去年还是一片空白。县委书记意味深长地说：“去年大办钢铁以前，人们看到了铁矿石也认不得。”是大办钢铁，使这里的人们认识了铁矿石；是大办钢铁，使这里的人们建起了许许多多的小土炉；是大办钢铁，使这里的人们用自己的双手砌成了两座三十立方米的小洋炉。大办钢铁以前，平遥县基本上只有轻工业；今天，重工业产值在工业总产值中已达到44.8％。
    然而这个铁工厂在今年8月初的日产量并不是五十多吨，而是十三吨。原来那时只有一个炉子——红旗炉在生产；另一个炉子，由于人们认为困难很多，条件不具备，一直没有投入生产。党的八中全会的精神一传达，大家一反右倾、一鼓干劲，把困难统统克服了，这座高炉也就以新兵上阵的姿态投入了钢铁的战斗。厂里于是把它命名为“八八炉”，表示是贯彻八届八中全会精神的产物。
    真是一个再好没有的名称！一路上，我们耳闻目睹八中全会的精神在生活中引起了多么深刻、巨大的变化。介休县的同志告诉我们，他们那里的工作从8月份起大有变化，越变越好，一个月胜过一个月。例如焦炭的生产，8月份后节节上升，人没有增加，产量却提高了一半。这样的例子各地都有，俯拾皆是。谈到反右倾后干部和群众的情绪，人们都充满激情地说：“大炼钢铁的劲头又上来了！”有些地方的妇女正在准备棉衣和鞋子，准备今冬大干冬季生产。
      苦战和甜战
    一天晚上，我们住在汾阳县万年青公社的贾家庄管理区。农村的夜晚，生活仍然是沸腾的。县里召开了广播大会，交流先进经验。管理区也在举行会议，研究当前的生产。一些社员在剥玉米。我们听到在一群剥着玉米的社员中间，爆发出一阵长久的响亮的笑声。我们被吸引住，走近前去，原来是一个社员在讲笑话。想必他讲的笑话非常引人入胜，不然怎会引起那样普遍而热烈的反响呢？可惜因为语言的隔阂，我没有能够听懂。
    另外一天的下午，我们在平遥县襄垣公社柏森管理区参观，也看到人们一面认真地干活，一面爽朗地唱歌、说着快板。这个管理区的每个生产队都有三员：读报员、文化辅导员和教唱员。俱乐部经常有读报、读书、演唱、说快板等活动。他们的文化生活是这样活跃，以致有的青年起初因为不安心农村工作而离开家乡，以后又被吸引回来了。
    我们常常看到这样的场面：既是紧张的劳动，又是愉快的劳动。我们跟一个社员说：“你们的苦战精神很好。”他不同意地回答说：“不，不是苦战，是甜战！”
    是的，当人们自觉自愿为着自己的美好生活而辛勤劳动，当人们从辛勤的劳动中已经尝到甘美的果实的时候，这劳动为什么不同时是甜蜜的、欢乐的呢？
    一些号称共产党员的右倾机会主义者说什么“苦战糟得很”。他们被普通的公社社员拉下多远啊！
