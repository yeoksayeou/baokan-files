National Cotton Textile Experience Exchange Meeting Summarizes and Determines New Creations of the Masses
Textile System's Hao Jianxiu Work Method and 1951 Weaving Method Increasingly Improved
Xinhua News Agency, Qingdao: The Ministry of Textile Industry and the National Committee of the Textile Workers' Union of China recently jointly convened the National Cotton Textile Operation Experience Exchange Meeting in Qingdao, summarizing the achievements of the two major work methods in cotton textile operation over the past eight years—the Hao Jianxiu Work Method and the 1951 Weaving Work Method—in spinning and weaving.

The meeting believed that the practice of the past eight years has proven that these two major work methods are in line with the multi-machine operation characteristics of the textile industry and are scientific work methods because they have the most basic advantages: planned work, regular patrolling, rational organization of various operations, and active implementation of the spirit of prevention first. Therefore, in-depth promotion of these two major work methods has brought about major changes and improvements in the operating skills and production levels of Chinese cotton textile workers. Over the past eight years, under the leadership of the Party, the scientific and technological level of China's textile industry has greatly improved, and the technical knowledge of textile workers has also been continuously and widely improved. These two major work methods collectively reflect their wisdom and have played a significant role in successfully completing the annual national production plans.

During the meeting, famous operating experts from twenty-seven provinces (cities) and autonomous regions across the country, such as Xu Guihua, Wu Guiyun, Sun Guizhen, Xu Xiumin, and Wang Guiying, gave comprehensive and individual operation demonstrations.

Based on the operating experience created by outstanding cotton textile workers in various regions in recent years, the meeting developed and supplemented the two major work methods through observation performances, technical measurements, and analysis research. The experience developed and added to the two major work methods this time includes the following aspects: In strengthening planning, handling complex thread breaks should follow three priorities – easy before difficult, urgent before slow, right before left; ordinary looms should do a good job of "long distance, short saving," and master the method of segmented shuttle changing, etc. In strengthening prevention, the main thing is to master machine performance and pay attention to machine inspection at any time during work to prevent the occurrence of defects. In spinning, the "six dos" experience of doing a good job in cleaning work by doing it diligently and less, doing it in segments, doing it at any time, doing it with multiple ends, doing it crosswise, and doing it with both hands, as well as the experience of automatic looms in inspecting fabric surfaces, inspecting warp yarns, and preventing and reducing defects, were also enriched. In terms of individual operations, the meeting, based on the principle of good, fast, and safe, integrated many effective experiences created by cotton textile workers in various regions, such as the piecing method that meets the requirements of high-speed and high-quality fine yarn and the first divide and then pull smooth inlaid wrap roll roving changing method, the reed forcing method of automatic looms, and the cross-combined method of handling automatic loom stoppages.

During the meeting, Chen Shaomin, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and Li Zaiwen, Secretary of the Secretariat of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, both attended the meeting and delivered important reports to the representatives. Chen Weiji, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Textile Industry, made a summary at the meeting.

    先进技术也要不断革新
    全国棉纺织经验交流会总结测定群众的新创造
    纺织系统郝建秀工作法1951织布法益趋完善
    据新华社青岛电　纺织工业部和中国纺织工会全国委员会最近在青岛联合召开了全国棉纺织运转操作经验交流会议，总结了八年来棉纺织业运转操作的两大工作法——郝建秀工作法和1951织布工作法在纺纱和织布方面所获得的成就。
    会议认为，八年来的实践证明，这两大工作法是符合纺织工业多机台生产特点的，是科学的工作法，因为它们有着最基本的优点：工作有计划，巡回有规律，合理组织各项操作，并且积极贯彻以预防为主的精神。因此，深入推广这两大工作法，就使我国棉纺织业工人的操作技术和生产水平发生重大的变革和提高。八年来，在党的领导下，我国纺织工业的科学技术水平有了很大的提高，同时纺织工人的技术知识也在不断和广泛地提高。这两大工作法，集中地反映了他们的智慧，并且为顺利地完成每年国家的生产计划起了很大的作用。
    会议期间，来自全国二十七个省（市）自治区的著名操作能手许桂花、吴桂云、孙桂珍、徐秀敏、王桂英等，分别作了全面和单项操作表演。
    会议根据近几年来各地优秀棉纺织工人创造的操作经验，通过观摩表演，技术测定和分析研究，发展和补充了两大工作法。这次发展和补充到两大工作法中去的经验共有以下几个方面。在加强计划性方面，处理复杂断头要做到三先三后——先易后难，先急后缓，先右后左；普通布机要做好“段远节近”、掌握分段换梭的方法等。在加强预防性方面，主要是掌握机器性能，在工作中随时注意机器的检查，以预防疵点的产生。在细纱方面，还充实了做好清洁工作的勤做少做、分段做、随时做、多头做、交叉做、双手做的“六做”经验，以及自动布机的检查布面，检查经纱，预防和减少疵点的经验等。在单项操作方面，会议根据好快安全的原则，综合了各地棉纺织工人创造的许多行之有效的经验，例如细纱适应高速优质要求的接头法和先分后拉顺镶包卷换粗纱法，自动布机的逼筘法，处理自动布机停台交叉结合法等。
    会议期间，中华全国总工会副主席陈少敏和中华全国总工会书记处书记栗再温，都到会向代表作了重要报告。纺织工业部副部长陈维稷在会上作了总结。
